00:00:00,196 --> 00:00:03,921
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:03,921 --> 00:00:11,455
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Tonight is going to be

3
00:00:11,455 --> 00:00:15,185
interesting based on where we left off last time,
but before we get to all of that, let me get

4
00:00:15,185 --> 00:00:19,793
through tonight's announcements for you guys so we
can get to the game proper. For those of you who

5
00:00:19,793 --> 00:00:24,369
are drinking: first shot, there you go. First and
foremost, tonight's episode is brought to you by

6
00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:25,880
our good friends at Loot Crate!

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,378
ALL: Loot Crate!

8
00:00:27,378 --> 00:00:30,448
MATT: Sam, did you want to take us away?

9
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:35,924
SAM: Guys! Loot Crate has a brand new theme for
December, Revolution! They're always watching,

10
00:00:35,924 --> 00:00:39,702
they've designed a system to keep you down,
they're meddlesome, it's time for a revolution!

11
00:00:39,702 --> 00:00:47,444
Here's the thing. Every week I do these sort of
funny bits about Loot Crate. This week, it's going

12
00:00:47,444 --> 00:00:54,495
to be hard for me, because-- to get real with you
guys for a second-- my son, this morning, at his

13
00:00:54,495 --> 00:00:58,794
preschool they found that his pre-school's bunny
has deceased.

14
00:00:58,794 --> 00:01:00,871
(sympathetic noises)

15
00:01:00,871 --> 00:01:04,167
SAM: And so they wanted me-- I talked to some of
the kids. Some of the kids are actually-- they

16
00:01:04,167 --> 00:01:13,734
like the show? And they asked if I could bring the
bunny in a Loot Crate to pay tribute.

17
00:01:13,734 --> 00:01:16,336
LAURA: I do not believe you. You're not--

18
00:01:16,336 --> 00:01:24,614
SAM: So it's here. Because this makes the bunny
sort of part of the show. And the kids and the

19
00:01:24,614 --> 00:01:30,256
parents helped a little, they wrote a little
something to commemorate the bunny and I'm going

20
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:38,627
to read that for the kids. For the kids! What can
be said about Dennis the Hopper? The bestest bunny

21
00:01:38,627 --> 00:01:45,095
the Little Explorer's classroom ever had, the way
he always jumped left paw first, or nibbled on

22
00:01:45,095 --> 00:01:50,639
Olivia's Yo Gabba Gabba backpack? The way he
pooped whenever Maddie picked him up. We'll miss

23
00:01:50,639 --> 00:01:57,725
your floppy ears, your soft fur, but most of all,
your inner beauty. Love, the Little Explorers:

24
00:01:57,725 --> 00:02:04,680
Maddie, Olivia, Salinger, Paris, Justice, Woodley,
Appalonia, DeGrass, Garvey, Barack, Sashimi,

25
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,601
Neptune, Sevigny, Coachella, Aaliyah, Walnut, and
Kevin.

26
00:02:09,601 --> 00:02:16,486
MARISHA: To be fair, that sounds like a southern
California school. Silverlake!

27
00:02:16,486 --> 00:02:25,412
SAM: And now to honor their request to make the
bunny part of Critical Role forever, I'm going to--

28
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:27,102
TRAVIS: Don't touch it, man!

29
00:02:27,102 --> 00:02:32,364
SAM: We'll miss you, Dennis.

30
00:02:32,364 --> 00:02:36,950
TRAVIS: How long has that chicken been sitting in
that box?

31
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,886
SAM: Little long.

32
00:02:38,886 --> 00:02:40,930
(laughter)

33
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,623
LIAM: Hi to PETA, by the way.

34
00:02:42,623 --> 00:02:48,768
TRAVIS: Fucking hell. We have these amazing Loot
Crate DX boxes!

35
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:56,801
MATT: Go to lootcrate.com/criticalrole and use the promo code
CriticalRole, one word, you get 10% off your first

36
00:02:56,801 --> 00:03:01,961
month of Loot Crate. Sam couldn't say that because
his mouth is full of bunny. But let's go ahead and open.

37
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:06,967
MARISHA: The DX boxes aren't the clothes boxes,
are they?

38
00:03:06,967 --> 00:03:09,441
LAURA: No, no no. That's Loot Crate Clothes. But
wait!

39
00:03:09,441 --> 00:03:12,651
MATT: That's actually really cool.

40
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:17,558
LAURA: Is there Gears of War stuff in here? I
thought there might be.

41
00:03:17,558 --> 00:03:20,952
MATT: All about the Harry Potter blanket.

42
00:03:20,952 --> 00:03:25,067
LAURA: Shut up!

43
00:03:25,067 --> 00:03:30,972
TRAVIS: I'm a Baratheon, man, this means a lot to
me!

44
00:03:30,972 --> 00:03:38,232
MATT: Look at this blanket, guys: Wanded, and
Extremely Dangerous.

45
00:03:38,232 --> 00:03:42,044
MARISHA: It's going to take me the whole unboxing
to get it open.

46
00:03:42,044 --> 00:03:43,879
TRAVIS: Holy shit!

47
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:47,915
TALIESIN: There's a Witcher Wild Hunt medallion
paperweight.

48
00:03:47,915 --> 00:03:50,146
MATT: I need more of these medallions, by the
way.

49
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:53,539
LIAM: Is that an Eye of Acomodo for my shirt?!

50
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:55,451
LAURA: What's the Harry Potter thing?

51
00:03:55,451 --> 00:03:57,447
TRAVIS: It's a Hogwarts book clip.

52
00:03:57,447 --> 00:03:59,093
MATT: You're slowly becoming more and more
your character.

53
00:03:59,093 --> 00:04:00,824
LIAM: Yeah, he talks just like this!

54
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:05,977
TALIESIN: This is not kidding around, this is kind
of intense!

55
00:04:05,977 --> 00:04:08,228
SAM: Does that go on your car, what is that?

56
00:04:08,228 --> 00:04:12,010
TALIESIN: It's a paperweight. You could brain
somebody with this.

57
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:16,089
MATT: This will be a murder weapon in some case
over the next year.

58
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,895
TRAVIS: This is so legit!

59
00:04:17,895 --> 00:04:20,174
TALIESIN: That's a bottle opener right there.

60
00:04:20,174 --> 00:04:25,385
TRAVIS: Since 1963, drawing what acid does to your
brain.

61
00:04:25,385 --> 00:04:27,663
LAURA: Thanks, Loot Crate!

62
00:04:27,663 --> 00:04:37,028
MARISHA: This is my further transformation to
actually becoming Melisandre in School of Thrones.

63
00:04:37,028 --> 00:04:43,550
SAM: Did we show this yet?

64
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:55,562
MARISHA: Yeah, if anyone doesn't know, Matt
produced, and I helped him in it, we were in this

65
00:04:55,562 --> 00:05:01,189
web series called School of Thrones, like four
years ago. You make a cameo in it.

66
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:03,056
TALIESIN: Yeah, I have a cameo in it.

67
00:05:03,056 --> 00:05:04,736
MATT: It's ridiculous.

68
00:05:04,736 --> 00:05:11,938
MARISHA: It's basically Game of Thrones in a John
Hughes film. Just watch it.

69
00:05:11,938 --> 00:05:13,377
MATT: Watch it!

70
00:05:13,377 --> 00:05:16,649
LAURA: I really like this.

71
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,986
TALIESIN: I'm stealing some of this stuff.

72
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:27,093
TRAVIS: I'm a Slytherin prefect, you need to go to
bed, Mr. Mercer. I apparently have an accent for

73
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:28,441
some reason.

74
00:05:28,441 --> 00:05:32,042
SAM: Guys, I'm going to keep the box in case the
preschool's parrot dies.

75
00:05:32,042 --> 00:05:34,724
TRAVIS: Yeah, you going to start a pet cemetery?

76
00:05:34,724 --> 00:05:47,052
MATT: Awesome. Thank you, Loot Crate. As a heads
up, guys, next week on December 6th from 6:00 to

77
00:05:47,052 --> 00:05:51,276
7:00pm, they're doing a Puzzle Quest special
stream here on Geek &amp; Sundry, and a number of us

78
00:05:51,276 --> 00:05:57,065
are going to be there with Ivan. Big thank you to
Magic the Gathering Puzzle Quest for putting this

79
00:05:57,065 --> 00:06:01,625
together. You guys probably remember back in
September a few of us showed up for Game the Game

80
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:07,289
Goes Critical, and thanks to you guys supporting
that show, they've come back to have us go ahead and do

81
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:12,477
this again. So we'll be here next Tuesday from
6:00 to 7:00, leading right up into Talks Machina,

82
00:06:12,477 --> 00:06:18,425
messing around. You can check out their game,
Magic the Gathering Puzzle Quest, on iOS and

83
00:06:18,425 --> 00:06:20,904
Android devices, and we'll see you guys hopefully
next Tuesday.

84
00:06:20,904 --> 00:06:23,146
(air horn)

85
00:06:23,146 --> 00:06:24,518
SAM: Whoa!

86
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:27,459
TRAVIS: Wow. That's so appropriate.

87
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:29,284
LIAM: That's my butt!

88
00:06:29,284 --> 00:06:31,954
MATT: I approve now. If that happens during the
game at any given point in time, that's

89
00:06:31,954 --> 00:06:33,300
disadvantage.

90
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,877
(air horn)

91
00:06:34,877 --> 00:06:39,271
MATT: Unless it's really funny.

92
00:06:39,271 --> 00:06:41,442
LIAM: Sound the horns.

93
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:48,122
MATT: Choose carefully, Liam. Choose carefully.
It's like telling a kid he can choose his own

94
00:06:48,122 --> 00:06:54,918
punishment, it's dangerous. Also, we're helping
support the amazing charity, Worldbuilders, with

95
00:06:54,918 --> 00:06:58,355
Patrick Rothfuss and a number of other great
authors. You can find out more at

96
00:06:58,355 --> 00:07:03,524
worldbuilders.org. They bring the power of readers
and writers and all that type of creativity

97
00:07:03,524 --> 00:07:08,604
together, to raise money to help make the world a
better place. Go check it out, it's a wonderful

98
00:07:08,604 --> 00:07:12,394
group and we'll hopefully be doing more things
with them coming up in the near future. Those

99
00:07:12,394 --> 00:07:16,584
announcements will come as we go forward, but
Patrick Rothfuss, who's a friend of the show, was

100
00:07:16,584 --> 00:07:17,850
a guest on Critical Role--

101
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,727
LIAM: I'm not really very familiar with Patrick
Rothfuss--

102
00:07:19,727 --> 00:07:22,593
MATT: You should read some of his stuff, it's
pretty good, he's a good writer. And apparently is

103
00:07:22,593 --> 00:07:24,655
now making a show with Lin-Manuel.

104
00:07:24,655 --> 00:07:28,242
MARISHA: I hear they're besties. He's actually my
new bestie.

105
00:07:28,242 --> 00:07:30,140
MATT: That's right, yeah, you got a cool ring.

106
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:33,079
MARISHA: Yeah, he gave me a ring, yeah. My new
best friend.

107
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,828
SAM: He put a ring on it?!

108
00:07:34,828 --> 00:07:40,401
TALIESIN: It is the six degrees of Lin-Manuel now,
isn't it? Kevin Bacon has been unthroned.

109
00:07:40,401 --> 00:07:45,332
MATT: We're all slowly making our way towards
getting him on the show. That's the goal.

110
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:47,839
TALIESIN: Lin-Manuel, on the show.

111
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:49,648
LIAM: I'm willing to wait for it.

112
00:07:49,648 --> 00:07:52,858
MARISHA: Lin-Manuel, on this show. This one.

113
00:07:52,858 --> 00:08:00,701
MATT: Next up, this next Monday, actually, we are
doing the final wrap-up episode of Force Grey:

114
00:08:00,701 --> 00:08:07,883
Giant Hunters live at the Egyptian Theater here in
Hollywood from 5:00-8:30pm next Monday. We'll also

115
00:08:07,883 --> 00:08:11,579
be streaming it. The tickets are free, by the way,
so if you're in the vicinity, go ahead and get

116
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:15,962
some tickets, come join us. We have a great cast,
a couple of new members are joining in for this.

117
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:20,563
It's going to be a lot of fun and a great finale
for the Force Grey series. Those who watched the

118
00:08:20,563 --> 00:08:25,769
Acquisitions Inc series and their PAX game, there
might be a few fun little nods in there as well.

119
00:08:25,769 --> 00:08:29,591
So, anyway, much love to you guys if you can make
it, if not we'll see you on Twitch on Monday

120
00:08:29,591 --> 00:08:35,768
regardless! And last but not least, here on Geek &amp;
Sundry there is coming up the Dick and Johnson

121
00:08:35,768 --> 00:08:43,731
Ultimate Christmas Special, with lots of familiar
faces. Zach Carr is DMing this, it's a kick ass

122
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:47,145
and chew bubblegum game, I'm sure you've seen it
probably on Game the Game before, it's a great

123
00:08:47,145 --> 00:08:55,561
game. It's been on a few other projects here. But
Hector and Keller, they're going to be playing

124
00:08:55,561 --> 00:09:00,548
through your favorite BFF duo to save everything
in the world. There might be some cameos, a bunch

125
00:09:00,548 --> 00:09:06,023
of rapid-fire cameos throughout the show, so check
out the Dick and Johnson Save Christmas special at

126
00:09:06,023 --> 00:09:11,188
December 12, at 4:00pm Pacific here on Twitch.
It's going to be fun.

127
00:09:11,188 --> 00:09:12,725
TRAVIS: That is the best name.

128
00:09:12,725 --> 00:09:19,117
MATT: Might be showing up off screen, just to
heckle people. Or more. We'll find out. All right,

129
00:09:19,117 --> 00:09:20,562
any other announcements?

130
00:09:20,562 --> 00:09:23,685
LIAM: Yeah, she's trying to keep it on the down
low, but Laura doesn't have any of her dice,

131
00:09:23,685 --> 00:09:27,259
really. She has three sets instead of the usual
ten.

132
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:31,411
LAURA: I brought my bag of dice home for the
holiday and then I didn't bring it--

133
00:09:31,411 --> 00:09:32,951
SAM: Why did you bring it home?

134
00:09:32,951 --> 00:09:38,033
LAURA: I maybe was going to give some of our dice
to our winners for the costume contest.

135
00:09:38,033 --> 00:09:39,551
SAM: But instead--

136
00:09:39,551 --> 00:09:41,896
LAURA: I just left them at home.

137
00:09:41,896 --> 00:09:44,154
SAM: I have a bag of dice in there that I've never
used.

138
00:09:44,154 --> 00:09:50,274
LAURA: I have a lot of dice, I just don't have all my
dice, you guys. I still have a bunch up here.

139
00:09:50,274 --> 00:09:54,078
TRAVIS: She literally has 300 over here.

140
00:09:54,078 --> 00:09:56,549
LAURA: I do, I have a lot. But thank you!

141
00:09:56,549 --> 00:09:58,102
TALIESIN: We're doomed.

142
00:09:58,102 --> 00:10:01,721
MARISHA: Speaking of charities, before we go on.
Speaking of charities, I would still like to give

143
00:10:01,721 --> 00:10:10,078
a shout-out to 826LA, who we so love and support.
They're great. People will send us tweets being

144
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:15,188
like, "Hey, do you guys still support 826LA?"
Always, I don't think you can stop supporting

145
00:10:15,188 --> 00:10:16,551
826LA.

146
00:10:16,551 --> 00:10:20,460
TALIESIN and MARISHA: I don't know, they know what
they did.

147
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,995
TALIESIN: And they have their own shop also, and
if you're interested you can go and shop at 826,

148
00:10:23,995 --> 00:10:29,276
and they have super cool posters and books. And
buttons, and all sorts of stuff that you can get

149
00:10:29,276 --> 00:10:31,593
that they put out that are super super cool.

150
00:10:31,593 --> 00:10:36,227
MARISHA: And I've seen people take you up on your
suggestion that it's always a great date place.

151
00:10:36,227 --> 00:10:37,753
TALIESIN: It is such a good date place.

152
00:10:37,753 --> 00:10:40,105
MARISHA: We've had people tweet at us and be like,
we took you up on that, and it is a good date

153
00:10:40,105 --> 00:10:42,589
place, because they have cute store fronts, so you
should go.

154
00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:46,764
TALIESIN: Yeah. The actual quality of the date is
not guaranteed, but the quality of the venue--

155
00:10:46,764 --> 00:10:48,982
MARISHA and TALIESIN: No. That depends on you.

156
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,560
MARISHA: And we can't help that.

157
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,621
SAM: Could you do a wedding there if you wanted
to?

158
00:10:52,621 --> 00:10:53,678
TALIESIN: A very small one.

159
00:10:53,678 --> 00:10:55,206
SAM: Or a bar mitzvah, or maybe a bris?

160
00:10:55,206 --> 00:10:57,176
TALIESIN: A very small wedding, or a wedding with
small people.

161
00:10:57,176 --> 00:10:59,672
SAM: All right.

162
00:10:59,672 --> 00:11:08,125
MATT: All righty then. On that note, unless anyone
else has anything to say we are going to

163
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:12,819
dive into tonight's episode of Critical Role.

164
00:11:12,819 --> 00:12:46,918
[dramatic music]

165
00:12:46,918 --> 00:12:54,901
MATT: Welcome back, everyone. Including my party.
Who need to calm the fuck down.

166
00:12:54,901 --> 00:12:56,986
(laughter)

167
00:12:56,986 --> 00:12:58,483
LIAM: Party!

168
00:12:58,483 --> 00:13:04,356
MATT: So, picking up where we left off last time.
The group of intrepid adventurers known as Vox

169
00:13:04,356 --> 00:13:09,587
Machina have been making their way through their
quest to take down the Chroma Conclave, a group of

170
00:13:09,587 --> 00:13:14,971
chromatic dragons who have been terrorizing the
countryside in Tal'Dorei under the rule of Thordak

171
00:13:14,971 --> 00:13:21,711
the Cinder King, a great, powerful, and seemingly
elementally charged ancient red dragon who sits in

172
00:13:21,711 --> 00:13:25,872
the center of the city of Emon. After gathering
the rest of the artifacts you guys have been

173
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:31,362
seeking, called the Vestiges of Divergence, the
last one being found in the City of Brass upon the

174
00:13:31,362 --> 00:13:38,942
Fire Elemental Plane, you traveled back to Fort
Daxio, a northern fort north of Emon, where you

175
00:13:38,942 --> 00:13:44,185
were planning a trap of some kind for Thordak.
Upon arriving with two charges of yours, two

176
00:13:44,185 --> 00:13:52,528
previously enslaved celestial-blooded boys that
you found in the City of Brass, you all traveled

177
00:13:52,528 --> 00:13:58,641
across the planes, with the help of Keyleth, back
to Fort Daxio to find the landscape scarred with

178
00:13:58,641 --> 00:14:06,279
recent flame and apparently a battle raging at the
outer gate. That is where we left off. So, you

179
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:12,340
guys, looking northward, you can see the large
plumes of black smoke billowing up from the

180
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:15,658
direction of the fort. The outer wall seems to
have sustained some damage. You can see a number

181
00:14:15,658 --> 00:14:20,254
of flying entities swooping in. Dozens of them,
while you can hear the distant sound of combat,

182
00:14:20,254 --> 00:14:26,662
shouts and battle. You guys, as you land and
realize this, you can see the two slaves, who have

183
00:14:26,662 --> 00:14:31,925
now been freed and taken with you, both look
immediately wide eyed and freaked out and closed

184
00:14:31,925 --> 00:14:33,565
off. What are you guys doing?

185
00:14:33,565 --> 00:14:35,024
TRAVIS: This is fine.

186
00:14:35,024 --> 00:14:37,002
MARISHA: So much safer here, kids.

187
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:38,445
LAURA: We need to get them safe.

188
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:41,618
SAM: Who safe? The place is on fire. They're not
safe.

189
00:14:41,618 --> 00:14:44,065
LAURA: I take off on my broom and fly up in the
air.

190
00:14:44,065 --> 00:14:46,227
SAM: Ah! Wait! You forgot your hat!

191
00:14:46,227 --> 00:14:50,962
LAURA: I want to see up and over the wall and see
what's going on on the inside.

192
00:14:50,962 --> 00:14:56,129
MATT: Okay. So you fly up and head up over the
front wall.

193
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:58,082
LAURA: I don't want to go in, I just want to
look.

194
00:14:58,082 --> 00:15:01,784
MATT: Right. So you fly up and get a vantage point
to see what's going on over the wall.

195
00:15:01,784 --> 00:15:03,106
LAURA: Yes.

196
00:15:03,106 --> 00:15:07,260
TRAVIS: You're going to get seen.

197
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:15,077
MATT: As you crest up in the air, you notice that
there are a number of soldiers currently battling

198
00:15:15,077 --> 00:15:22,457
possibly a hundred or more lizard men that have
swarmed into the fort, as well as a number of--

199
00:15:22,457 --> 00:15:26,902
and go ahead and make a perception check actually to
see if you can make some good detailed elements out.

200
00:15:26,902 --> 00:15:29,122
TRAVIS: First roll of the night.

201
00:15:29,122 --> 00:15:34,196
LAURA: First roll, first roll, first roll. Here we
go. 27.

202
00:15:34,196 --> 00:15:39,995
MATT: 27. All right. These are wyvern riders. This
is a group of wyvern riders, with lizard men, that

203
00:15:39,995 --> 00:15:50,214
have swooped in. You can see a number of the siege
elements that have been built by Percy over there,

204
00:15:50,214 --> 00:15:53,955
some have been firing off on the inside or at
least ones that were installed in the actual fort

205
00:15:53,955 --> 00:15:59,646
base. You also see a distant explosion, a flash of
light on one of the walls on the inside. There is

206
00:15:59,646 --> 00:16:03,665
the outer wall, and there is a courtyard in the
actual fortress itself. The front gates to the

207
00:16:03,665 --> 00:16:07,569
inner courtyard have already been breached, and
most of the battle is happening inside the main

208
00:16:07,569 --> 00:16:08,842
courtyard.

209
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,658
TRAVIS: Are we outside the courtyard or inside?

210
00:16:10,658 --> 00:16:15,625
MATT: As you're noticing this, you watch as two
wyverns are now swooping in your direction from

211
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:18,002
the outside of the outer wall.

212
00:16:18,002 --> 00:16:19,410
SAM: Because they saw you.

213
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,079
MARISHA: So we're on the outside of the wall?

214
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:26,164
MATT: You guys are far south, probably a good
quarter-mile south of the fort, on the outside of

215
00:16:26,164 --> 00:16:27,433
the wall.

216
00:16:27,433 --> 00:16:29,664
TALIESIN: I say we starting making our way and
deal with this.

217
00:16:29,664 --> 00:16:32,339
LAURA: Yeah. I draw-- are they close enough to
shoot them?

218
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:36,171
MATT: You can wait until they're close enough.
They're a little bit out of your range right now.

219
00:16:36,171 --> 00:16:40,275
TALIESIN: Is it possible they're out of Bad News'
range or is that even humanly possible?

220
00:16:40,275 --> 00:16:45,951
MATT: You know what, as of right now, you could
probably hit one of them with Bad News.

221
00:16:45,951 --> 00:16:50,884
TALIESIN: All right. I double check. Speak now or
forever hold your peace, I'm doing this.

222
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:53,500
MATT: What's the long range on it?

223
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,018
TALIESIN: 1,200.

224
00:16:55,018 --> 00:16:58,446
MATT: Okay. You bear down and you--

225
00:16:58,446 --> 00:17:00,602
TALIESIN: 1,200 feet. 1,200 feet.

226
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:06,802
MATT: Yeah. Go for it. And Laura, you still have
to wait at this point. You're readying your shot.

227
00:17:06,802 --> 00:17:10,684
LAURA: Yeah. But I Hunter's Mark one of them.

228
00:17:10,684 --> 00:17:13,500
MATT: Okay. Aiming for--

229
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,405
LAURA: Oh wait, it's probably a ranged thing too.

230
00:17:15,405 --> 00:17:20,043
MATT: It's okay. You're currently selecting a
wyvern or the rider to fire at?

231
00:17:20,043 --> 00:17:24,038
LAURA: The rider.

232
00:17:24,038 --> 00:17:33,047
TALIESIN: All right. Taking a shot. Oh, that'll
do! 30.

233
00:17:33,047 --> 00:17:39,619
MATT: The explosion from the front of the muzzle
of Bad News fires off, the spark and flame and

234
00:17:39,619 --> 00:17:46,677
smoke billowing forth. The shot has no impact. It
looks like, from gauging at this distance, it was

235
00:17:46,677 --> 00:17:48,234
just outside of the range.

236
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,786
LAURA: Oh, they're 1,200 feet away, they're that
far?

237
00:17:50,786 --> 00:17:54,578
MATT: It's hard to gauge really, at that distance,
whether or not they were there, but apparently the

238
00:17:54,578 --> 00:17:57,457
bullet lost momentum by the time it reached their
position.

239
00:17:57,457 --> 00:17:58,727
TALIESIN: Okay. Reload.

240
00:17:58,727 --> 00:17:59,865
MARISHA: Let's move in.

241
00:17:59,865 --> 00:18:03,706
LAURA: Can I shout down and yell, get the boys
safe! But I don't know who I'm shouting it to,

242
00:18:03,706 --> 00:18:05,177
just one of you guys--

243
00:18:05,177 --> 00:18:06,545
TRAVIS: More impassioned.

244
00:18:06,545 --> 00:18:08,258
LAURA: (yelling) Get the boys safe!

245
00:18:08,258 --> 00:18:10,842
SAM: Oh my god. We have to get these boys to
safety.

246
00:18:10,842 --> 00:18:12,689
TRAVIS: Do we?

247
00:18:12,689 --> 00:18:20,337
MARISHA: Why don't we have them run? Have them
run. Yeah. I grab them and I say, run that way.

248
00:18:20,337 --> 00:18:24,434
Don't die. They're good.

249
00:18:24,434 --> 00:18:26,110
LAURA: Seriously?

250
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:29,185
TALIESIN: Actually, I've got a better idea.

251
00:18:29,185 --> 00:18:30,313
MARISHA: What?

252
00:18:30,313 --> 00:18:31,906
TALIESIN: Hand them one of the stones.

253
00:18:31,906 --> 00:18:35,209
MARISHA: All right, yeah, sure. I hand them a
gatestone.

254
00:18:35,209 --> 00:18:38,437
TALIESIN: We'll find you when it's safe. Hide
wherever you need to. Stay away from the castle.

255
00:18:38,437 --> 00:18:40,531
We will find you when it's safe.

256
00:18:40,531 --> 00:18:42,350
MARISHA: Hide in the bushes, don't go far.

257
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,689
SAM: Or go anywhere.

258
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:48,518
MATT: They nod and they take the stone, and they
start running off towards the western edge of this

259
00:18:48,518 --> 00:18:53,501
valley, which has the two cliffsides that come
into the valley here. A lot of the nearby brush

260
00:18:53,501 --> 00:18:56,920
appears to have been burned on the way.

261
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,545
MARISHA: Oh, fuck. I say, try and stay unseen!

262
00:19:00,545 --> 00:19:09,623
MATT: They go darting off, keeping low, and you
get the sense that they're used to fleeing, so

263
00:19:09,623 --> 00:19:13,502
they dart off, arm in arm, rushing off towards the
side of the valley wall.

264
00:19:13,502 --> 00:19:15,942
SAM: So they're gone forever.

265
00:19:15,942 --> 00:19:19,183
MATT: You have time to reload before they get
close enough for her to fire, so if you want to

266
00:19:19,183 --> 00:19:20,651
take another shot.

267
00:19:20,651 --> 00:19:22,434
TALIESIN: Sure. I'll take another shot.

268
00:19:22,434 --> 00:19:24,649
LAURA: Should I hang out and wait or should we--

269
00:19:24,649 --> 00:19:32,219
TALIESIN: Actually, let's head as a group towards
this. I say we run and we take everything that's

270
00:19:32,219 --> 00:19:37,257
heading towards us. I'll wait until they're close
enough that I can get a good--

271
00:19:37,257 --> 00:19:38,882
MARISHA: We all charge for the gate.

272
00:19:38,882 --> 00:19:41,382
MATT: Okay, so you guys are all charging towards
the outer gate. What are you doing, Vex? You watch

273
00:19:41,382 --> 00:19:42,853
the rest of your party darting--

274
00:19:42,853 --> 00:19:46,221
MARISHA: I Message to Vex, and I say, what do you
see? How many wyverns are there? Do you see any

275
00:19:46,221 --> 00:19:47,538
dragons?

276
00:19:47,538 --> 00:19:49,666
LAURA: Do I see any dragons?

277
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,898
MATT: Currently you do not see any dragons at
the--

278
00:19:51,898 --> 00:19:56,242
LAURA: I don't see any dragons, but it looks like
about a hundred enemies.

279
00:19:56,242 --> 00:19:59,301
SAM: Hundred! Is that true? I missed that one.

280
00:19:59,301 --> 00:20:00,710
MATT: Yes.

281
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:02,126
TRAVIS: That's a lot.

282
00:20:02,126 --> 00:20:03,693
SAM: (laughing) That's more than two.

283
00:20:03,693 --> 00:20:05,301
TRAVIS: Is it?

284
00:20:05,301 --> 00:20:06,942
LIAM: What do you sense? Do you sense dragons?

285
00:20:06,942 --> 00:20:09,098
LAURA: Well, that's going to take a minute.

286
00:20:09,098 --> 00:20:10,401
LIAM: I'd work on that.

287
00:20:10,401 --> 00:20:15,506
SAM: All right, let's just charge in blindly!
There's no cover out here, right?

288
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:16,737
MATT: There is no cover.

289
00:20:16,737 --> 00:20:19,397
SAM: Let's take out those fucking riders.

290
00:20:19,397 --> 00:20:26,760
MARISHA: We have an Avengers moment. We're
running. Like Guardians of the Galaxy!

291
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,773
TRAVIS: That's like Chariots of Fire. You're doing
the wrong music.

292
00:20:28,773 --> 00:20:33,489
MARISHA: Okay, you know what, any movie where they
run in slow motion toward something, which happens

293
00:20:33,489 --> 00:20:34,602
a lot.

294
00:20:34,602 --> 00:20:39,915
MATT: There you go. As you guys are charging
towards the blown-open gates to the outer

295
00:20:39,915 --> 00:20:45,640
courtyard of Fort Daxio, with Vex swooping down on
her broom with the bow out, you watch as these

296
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:52,092
wyvern riders come swooping down in your
direction. Their claws extended, their tails and

297
00:20:52,092 --> 00:20:57,892
stingers out forward, they come swooping down. Go
ahead and take a shot. You can take a shot as well.

298
00:20:57,892 --> 00:21:00,883
TALIESIN: I'm taking my first shot. I'm also
making it a wing shot.

299
00:21:00,883 --> 00:21:03,822
LAURA: So I Hunter's Marked them as soon as they
were close enough.

300
00:21:03,822 --> 00:21:10,464
MATT: Yes. Hunter's Mark. There's two, and a third
one has joined, a little behind now. They're

301
00:21:10,464 --> 00:21:13,672
coming upon you. Which one do you Hunter's Mark?

302
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:15,343
LAURA: The one that's biggest?

303
00:21:15,343 --> 00:21:17,140
MATT: Hard to gauge at this distance.

304
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,512
LAURA: The one that's closest.

305
00:21:18,512 --> 00:21:19,730
MATT: Okay, there you go.

306
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:21,309
TALIESIN: Wing shot, first one.

307
00:21:21,309 --> 00:21:24,789
LAURA: And I am a third level rogue now.

308
00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:26,147
TALIESIN: 30.

309
00:21:26,147 --> 00:21:32,885
LAURA: So I get advantage on my attack, if they
haven't attacked me yet, right? If they haven't

310
00:21:32,885 --> 00:21:34,413
taken a turn?

311
00:21:34,413 --> 00:21:36,543
MATT: I believe, looking at the specifics there--

312
00:21:36,543 --> 00:21:41,941
LAURA: As an assassin? At your third level, you
get advantage if you get the drop, if they haven't

313
00:21:41,941 --> 00:21:43,659
taken a turn yet.

314
00:21:43,659 --> 00:21:45,460
MATT: Technically--

315
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:49,042
LAURA: They're moving?

316
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:52,978
MATT: They know you're around. This is less like
they haven't acted yet. They've been acting. Every

317
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:57,290
round, they've been dashing toward you. So you do
not have the drop on them, as they've been making

318
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:59,358
a beeline since the beginning. Apologies.

319
00:21:59,358 --> 00:22:02,914
LAURA: Well, all right. I guess I'll just have a
32 attack, then.

320
00:22:02,914 --> 00:22:07,462
MATT: Okay, I want you and Percy to both roll
damage on those attacks, as these are both guided

321
00:22:07,462 --> 00:22:09,249
at the same individual.

322
00:22:09,249 --> 00:22:10,725
TALIESIN: Okay.

323
00:22:10,725 --> 00:22:24,761
LAURA: 21, and then-- That is awesome.

324
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:32,007
TALIESIN: 26 points of damage, and he has to make
a strength save against becoming prone.

325
00:22:32,007 --> 00:22:34,434
LAURA: Do I get sneak attack on this?

326
00:22:34,434 --> 00:22:37,187
MATT: No, you would not, unfortunately.

327
00:22:37,187 --> 00:22:39,739
LAURA: Okay, so it's just 21 damage, with four of
lightning.

328
00:22:39,739 --> 00:22:47,663
MATT: Okay! So, as you hear the explosion at the
front of the muzzle of Bad News take off, the

329
00:22:47,663 --> 00:22:52,016
arrow whizzing through the air, both impacting
into each side of the wyvern, you watch as one of

330
00:22:52,016 --> 00:22:56,413
its wings tears open. It tumbles forward, the
rider thrown off its back and clutching onto its

331
00:22:56,413 --> 00:23:01,809
reins, flipping over the side as it corkscrews and
slams into the ground about 150, 200 feet behind

332
00:23:01,809 --> 00:23:03,528
you, skidding across the dirt.

333
00:23:03,528 --> 00:23:05,408
LAURA: Oh, I didn't do Hunter's Mark damage!

334
00:23:05,408 --> 00:23:06,718
MATT: Go for it.

335
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,340
LAURA: An additional three.

336
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:15,871
MATT: Okay. Effectively slammed and left behind in
the dust right now, it's going to have to get up

337
00:23:15,871 --> 00:23:19,352
and rush to try and catch up to you guys. The
other two are swooping down now and have managed

338
00:23:19,352 --> 00:23:20,616
to get up--

339
00:23:20,616 --> 00:23:21,793
LAURA: Do I get my second attack?

340
00:23:21,793 --> 00:23:25,608
MATT: You do get your second attack, yes. You
could as well, for your round.

341
00:23:25,608 --> 00:23:26,960
LAURA: 21.

342
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,186
MATT: Hits.

343
00:23:28,186 --> 00:23:30,074
TALIESIN: Same thing, with a drop.

344
00:23:30,074 --> 00:23:35,681
SAM: Can I extend my arm, with my Wand of
Fireballs ready to shoot?

345
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:38,397
MATT: Yeah, actually.

346
00:23:38,397 --> 00:23:41,901
LAURA: 18 damage.

347
00:23:41,901 --> 00:23:44,148
SAM: How far are they?

348
00:23:44,148 --> 00:23:47,353
MATT: At this point, they're maybe 150 feet from
you.

349
00:23:47,353 --> 00:23:49,534
TALIESIN: I don't crit on a 19 yet, do I?

350
00:23:49,534 --> 00:23:50,593
MATT: No.

351
00:23:50,593 --> 00:23:52,236
MARISHA: Do you ever get that?

352
00:23:52,236 --> 00:23:54,122
MATT: At a higher level.

353
00:23:54,122 --> 00:23:56,083
LAURA: Trinket crits on a 19.

354
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:58,900
MATT: Trinket's cool like that.

355
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:03,100
MARISHA: Why can't you be Trinket? We love the
bear more than you, Percy.

356
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:07,785
TALIESIN: Oh, I know. 32 to hit.

357
00:24:07,785 --> 00:24:12,699
MATT: And the save? What's the DC, again?

358
00:24:12,699 --> 00:24:14,870
TALIESIN: I believe it's--

359
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,295
MATT: You have to write down your DC, man.

360
00:24:17,295 --> 00:24:20,936
TALIESIN: I used to. Oh, 19. It's there, I just
couldn't see.

361
00:24:20,936 --> 00:24:25,761
MATT: There you go. This one now, as you guys
both-- you pull back and release your second

362
00:24:25,761 --> 00:24:33,079
arrow, and you take Bad News, reload it, and then
fire again-- you watch as this time, one of the

363
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:39,236
wings breaks at the hinge. It folds under itself.
The rider, this time, as opposed to holding on, is

364
00:24:39,236 --> 00:24:43,657
thrown and plummets the rest of the distance,
hitting the ground with a very heavy (splat)

365
00:24:43,657 --> 00:24:47,646
against the stonework, his head scattering. The
wyvern ends up slamming into the ground and

366
00:24:47,646 --> 00:24:50,978
skidding off into a big cloud of dust behind you
as well, as you guys continue pushing forward.

367
00:24:50,978 --> 00:24:57,290
However, that does complete your round. The last
one does swoop down and is going to-- You're

368
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:59,775
making the loudest noise and got the most
attention, so it's going to swoop in your

369
00:24:59,775 --> 00:25:05,415
direction, Percival. It's going to come on down,
it's going to make two attacks on you, and then

370
00:25:05,415 --> 00:25:13,541
harry and lift up. That's with its bite. That's
going to be a miss. It goes to snatch at you with

371
00:25:13,541 --> 00:25:19,660
its bite, and you duck out of the way. However,
the stinger comes up from behind. That is a 19 to hit.

372
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:23,660
TALIESIN: That just barely hits.

373
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:30,297
MATT: Just barely hits? Okay. As the stinger slams
into your shoulder, that is ten points of piercing

374
00:25:30,297 --> 00:25:33,295
damage. I need you to make a constitution saving
throw.

375
00:25:33,295 --> 00:25:39,420
TALIESIN: One of those again, okay. Ten points of
damage and a constitution saving throw.

376
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:44,380
TRAVIS: (singing) Roll high, you blue-haired
motherfucker.

377
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:48,066
SAM: It's, like, blue and purple.

378
00:25:48,066 --> 00:25:51,133
TALIESIN: I'm going to do a Resolve.

379
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:54,145
MATT: Okay, to take that saving throw again? Go
for it.

380
00:25:54,145 --> 00:26:00,979
TALIESIN: That's even worse. Do I have to take the
worse one for the Resolve?

381
00:26:00,979 --> 00:26:03,283
MATT: It's whatever you rolled the second time, I
think.

382
00:26:03,283 --> 00:26:06,457
TALIESIN: Can I burn another Resolve, just to fuck
it, because this is annoying me?

383
00:26:06,457 --> 00:26:10,154
LIAM: If it's like Luck, it's a no.

384
00:26:10,154 --> 00:26:14,979
MATT: Let me double check, just a moment.

385
00:26:14,979 --> 00:26:16,543
LAURA: Does it petrify you?

386
00:26:16,543 --> 00:26:18,417
TALIESIN: I'll find out!

387
00:26:18,417 --> 00:26:26,253
MATT: All right, so. This is your Indomitable? Not
Resolve, your Indomitable. You must use the new roll.

388
00:26:26,253 --> 00:26:28,896
TALIESIN: Okay, that's a 12.

389
00:26:28,896 --> 00:26:35,475
MATT: A 12? No. All right, so, as the poison
courses through your body, the stinger itself

390
00:26:35,475 --> 00:26:40,301
pulling forth, you see a bit of black-greenish
liquid spill out as it pulls itself out of the

391
00:26:40,301 --> 00:26:52,844
wound. You suffer 24 points of poison damage as it
then lifts back up out of range and is going to

392
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:55,856
circle around. You guys all still running? You see
Percy get hit.

393
00:26:55,856 --> 00:26:57,901
SAM: Can I take my Fireball shot?

394
00:26:57,901 --> 00:27:02,081
MATT: You can now. Because it was coming very
close before you had the opportunity to hit, it

395
00:27:02,081 --> 00:27:06,017
swings up past and you can now, reaching behind,
get a Fireball wand shot if you want.

396
00:27:06,017 --> 00:27:08,531
SAM: I will take my Fireball wand shot.

397
00:27:08,531 --> 00:27:10,423
LIAM: How high in the air is it?

398
00:27:10,423 --> 00:27:15,388
MATT: At this point now, as it swooped past, it's
about 40, 45 feet away? A safe enough distance for

399
00:27:15,388 --> 00:27:17,702
the Fireball to not blow up his own party.

400
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:20,927
SAM: It's got a DC of 15, that wand.

401
00:27:20,927 --> 00:27:24,520
MATT: That is a no. It rolled a three. So go ahead
and roll damage.

402
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:28,700
SAM: Can I fire more than one charge, or should I
have said that already?

403
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,630
MATT: You should have said that at the beginning.
It's a basic.

404
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:32,296
SAM: Never mind. So, it's 8d6, right?

405
00:27:32,296 --> 00:27:34,739
MATT: 8d6, you got it. And what are you doing,
Vax?

406
00:27:34,739 --> 00:27:36,883
LIAm: If I can attack, I'm throwing daggers.

407
00:27:36,883 --> 00:27:41,283
MATT: Yeah, you can do that, as it sweeps past
after getting the rapid stinger into the chest.

408
00:27:41,283 --> 00:27:45,819
LIAM: First gets 26, second is a 19.

409
00:27:45,819 --> 00:27:47,913
MATT: Okay, both hit.

410
00:27:47,913 --> 00:27:49,937
LIAM: Okay, dagger, dagger, dagger.

411
00:27:49,937 --> 00:27:51,273
SAM: 33.

412
00:27:51,273 --> 00:28:10,027
LIAM: 14 for the first, and the second is eight.
That's it. It's within 40 feet, you said?

413
00:28:10,027 --> 00:28:12,046
MATT: Yeah, as it swoops past.

414
00:28:12,046 --> 00:28:24,753
LIAM: I am going to Channel Divinity and use a Vow
of-- oh, I can't. Can I ditch the second attack?

415
00:28:24,753 --> 00:28:27,713
MATT: Nah, you've already confirmed it.

416
00:28:27,713 --> 00:28:33,722
SAM: Also, Matthew, I don't know if this affects
anything. I am exhausted. Does that change

417
00:28:33,722 --> 00:28:35,149
anything?

418
00:28:35,149 --> 00:28:37,207
MATT: Correct. You have one point of exhaustion,
which means that your ability checks are at

419
00:28:37,207 --> 00:28:42,743
disadvantage. Keyleth, Grog, do you guys want to
do anything while it passes overhead?

420
00:28:42,743 --> 00:28:44,562
MARISHA: You go first.

421
00:28:44,562 --> 00:28:46,996
TRAVIS: No, please, ladies first. No, I insist.

422
00:28:46,996 --> 00:28:52,464
MARISHA: Okay. I run to Percy and I grab and pick
him up and keep running, and I say, let me know if

423
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:53,752
you're poisoned.

424
00:28:53,752 --> 00:28:55,290
TALIESIN: Do I feel--?

425
00:28:55,290 --> 00:29:01,982
MATT: It was a burning pain through your body, but
it subsided after the original poison coursed

426
00:29:01,982 --> 00:29:05,238
through your body. So you fought it off
sufficiently afterward.

427
00:29:05,238 --> 00:29:09,201
MARISHA: Okay, I help him up and I say, come on!
And we keep running.

428
00:29:09,201 --> 00:29:11,052
MATT: Okay, you guys keep running. Grog?

429
00:29:11,052 --> 00:29:13,266
TRAVIS: The one that Vax shot that hit the
ground--

430
00:29:13,266 --> 00:29:14,676
LAURA: I'm Vex.

431
00:29:14,676 --> 00:29:16,046
TRAVIS: Yeah, whatever.

432
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:17,455
MATT: Yeah, that's 200 feet behind you.

433
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:18,664
TRAVIS: Oh, it's 200 feet.

434
00:29:18,664 --> 00:29:22,107
MATT: You guys have been running this whole time
as it went overhead and crashed into the ground

435
00:29:22,107 --> 00:29:23,326
behind you.

436
00:29:23,326 --> 00:29:24,394
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm good.

437
00:29:24,394 --> 00:29:28,155
MATT: Okay, you guys just keep running? Okay. So,
as you guys continue to run forward, it swings

438
00:29:28,155 --> 00:29:35,021
around after the Fireball detonates, and you see
it wobble in the air for a second. 33 points. The

439
00:29:35,021 --> 00:29:40,511
rider has turned to ash, blown off the top of it.
The wyvern, however, has still found its target

440
00:29:40,511 --> 00:29:45,138
and turns around and on its own is swooping back
towards the group of you guys. You're now about

441
00:29:45,138 --> 00:29:55,412
halfway towards the front gate of the keep, of Fort
Daxio. You guys, both Percy and Vex, with ranged

442
00:29:55,412 --> 00:29:58,549
weapons, you can take your shot now as it's
turning around and returning to you guys, still

443
00:29:58,549 --> 00:29:59,662
charging forward.

444
00:29:59,662 --> 00:30:00,742
LAURA: Hunter's Mark!

445
00:30:00,742 --> 00:30:03,362
MATT: All right, so you move your Hunter's Mark
over to that guy? Go for it.

446
00:30:03,362 --> 00:30:05,236
LAURA: 25.

447
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:07,180
MATT: That hits.

448
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:18,538
LAURA: 23.

449
00:30:18,538 --> 00:30:23,213
MATT: All right. 23 damage, nice. All righty.

450
00:30:23,213 --> 00:30:25,030
LAURA: On the first arrow.

451
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,785
MATT: Yes. Second one?

452
00:30:26,785 --> 00:30:33,652
LAURA: That is, what, 23? Yeah. 23.

453
00:30:33,652 --> 00:30:35,454
TRAVIS and LAURA: 22.

454
00:30:35,454 --> 00:30:43,242
MATT: Right, so there's five plus three for this,
and it's plus eight damage-- Oh, to hit! Okay.

455
00:30:43,242 --> 00:30:47,707
Both hit. I was like, that's really high damage
for arrows! My apologies.

456
00:30:47,707 --> 00:30:54,160
TRAVIS: Two ones in a row.

457
00:30:54,160 --> 00:31:00,819
LAURA: Shut up! Ugh! 13.

458
00:31:00,819 --> 00:31:02,663
MATT: 13 damage?

459
00:31:02,663 --> 00:31:04,431
LAURA: Three ones in a row!

460
00:31:04,431 --> 00:31:09,416
TRAVIS: I guess you've got to throw those dice
away! Only 900 left.

461
00:31:09,416 --> 00:31:14,649
MATT: So running forward, you turn around behind,
over your shoulder. You switch your actual direction

462
00:31:14,649 --> 00:31:18,755
of arrows you normally fire with and turn the
other way. Both arrows sink into it and you see it

463
00:31:18,755 --> 00:31:20,677
wobble in the air. Percy.

464
00:31:20,677 --> 00:31:27,225
TALIESIN: I'm going to take, on the fall-down, I
put Bad News away and I pull Animus out because

465
00:31:27,225 --> 00:31:34,502
it's closer now. So I can take easier pot shots at
it. 31.

466
00:31:34,502 --> 00:31:36,257
MATT: Hits.

467
00:31:36,257 --> 00:31:38,425
TALIESIN: How many shots, can I take a full round
of shots, or--?

468
00:31:38,425 --> 00:31:39,666
MATT: You can if you want to.

469
00:31:39,666 --> 00:31:43,409
TALIESIN: I'll take a full round. 31. 26.

470
00:31:43,409 --> 00:31:44,829
MATT: 26 hits.

471
00:31:44,829 --> 00:31:48,974
TALIESIN: And 33.

472
00:31:48,974 --> 00:31:51,067
MATT: All three hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

473
00:31:51,067 --> 00:32:10,671
TALIESIN: Where are my d10s at? That's not a d10.
There we go. That's three shots, it's 17--

474
00:32:10,671 --> 00:32:18,841
SAM: So much math!

475
00:32:18,841 --> 00:32:26,911
TALIESIN: I'm making sure I do this right
because-- 24 points, 34 points, 41 points of

476
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:28,279
damage plus--

477
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:32,671
MATT: Not on one hit. That's all of his attacks.

478
00:32:32,671 --> 00:32:39,065
TALIESIN: Three, it's three, yeah. 41 points of
damage plus ten points of psychic damage.

479
00:32:39,065 --> 00:32:40,556
MATT: Nice.

480
00:32:40,556 --> 00:32:43,435
TALIESIN: That was three shots.

481
00:32:43,435 --> 00:32:50,587
MATT: All righty, so all three shots pelt it in
the chest. You can see giant sections of its meaty

482
00:32:50,587 --> 00:32:55,523
chest blown open and it's streaking dark wyvern
blood behind it. However, it's still flying. The

483
00:32:55,523 --> 00:33:00,235
fervor on its face as it's near death is causing
it to get more intense as it swoops down toward

484
00:33:00,235 --> 00:33:05,227
you. Streaking out, the tail ends up curling
beneath. It's going to take a shot toward you,

485
00:33:05,227 --> 00:33:08,909
Percy, as you were the one that most recently hit
it and did the most damage. With the bite, that is

486
00:33:08,909 --> 00:33:13,693
a 24 to hit.

487
00:33:13,693 --> 00:33:15,105
TALIESIN: Oh, that hits.

488
00:33:15,105 --> 00:33:18,280
MATT: And the stinger is at only a 13 to hit.

489
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,904
TALIESIN: That does not hit!

490
00:33:19,904 --> 00:33:24,676
MATT: So, the stinger, seeing it coming this way,
you duck out of the way. However, its giant wyvern

491
00:33:24,676 --> 00:33:29,281
jaws clamp down and streak across your shoulder as
the momentum pulls it past, dragging it across the

492
00:33:29,281 --> 00:33:36,040
back. For that, you suffer ten points of piercing
damage.

493
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,178
MARISHA: That's not too bad.

494
00:33:38,178 --> 00:33:42,535
MATT: As it comes down at that point, it's back in
range for any of you melee folk that want to take

495
00:33:42,535 --> 00:33:45,084
a swing at it. Grog?

496
00:33:45,084 --> 00:33:49,143
TRAVIS: Can I rage, and can I take a swing at
Falcor, please?

497
00:33:49,143 --> 00:33:50,285
MATT: Yes, you can!

498
00:33:50,285 --> 00:33:52,210
TRAVIS: Okay! Lovely.

499
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:56,401
LIAM: We have no initiative, so I don't know who's
where. Am I close enough to go after Grog?

500
00:33:56,401 --> 00:34:00,331
MATT: Yes. I'm keeping tabs because this is more
of a flyby as you guys are running.

501
00:34:00,331 --> 00:34:02,751
TRAVIS: Could I make it a reckless attack,
please?

502
00:34:02,751 --> 00:34:04,892
MATT: Sure, yeah. A lot of these are happening
simultaneously.

503
00:34:04,892 --> 00:34:09,430
TRAVIS: 25.

504
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:12,162
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

505
00:34:12,162 --> 00:34:21,430
TRAVIS: Nine, 22, plus two points of necrotic,
24.

506
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:25,792
MATT: Okay, as it swoops down and bites into
Percy's arm as it drags up in the air, you watch

507
00:34:25,792 --> 00:34:28,975
as a very fast-running Grog, who's been ahead of
the group at this point, his speed is higher than

508
00:34:28,975 --> 00:34:35,312
anybody, spins around, axe in the air, and carves
right through the front of its chest to its back.

509
00:34:35,312 --> 00:34:39,894
It (screeching) and slides into two pieces that
then scatter into the ground, smearing black

510
00:34:39,894 --> 00:34:44,695
darkness across the dry, desert floor. You guys
continue to run forward. Currently, all your

511
00:34:44,695 --> 00:34:50,036
harrying wyverns are way too far behind and
damaged or not paying attention, before you guys

512
00:34:50,036 --> 00:34:54,500
are just now reaching the outside of the busted Fort
Daxio outer wall, where the front gates are

513
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,999
collapsed inward and slightly burned.

514
00:34:56,999 --> 00:34:59,988
TRAVIS: Didn't seem like that big of a problem.
That was not so tough.

515
00:34:59,988 --> 00:35:03,167
LAURA: There's a hundred more guys inside, Grog!

516
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:06,760
TRAVIS: I know, you keep saying that number, like
I know what it means, so let's get it on.

517
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,600
MARISHA: Grog, Grog! 100 needs three hands to
make.

518
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,941
TRAVIS: How many hands?

519
00:35:11,941 --> 00:35:13,081
MARISHA: It needs--

520
00:35:13,081 --> 00:35:14,334
TRAVIS: How many?

521
00:35:14,334 --> 00:35:15,481
LAURA: Keep running!

522
00:35:15,481 --> 00:35:17,690
MARISHA: Okay. Keep running! Keep running!

523
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:19,460
TALIESIN: It's not helpful.

524
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:22,608
MATT: You guys all go into the front gates?

525
00:35:22,608 --> 00:35:25,356
LAURA: I'm on the broom, so I'm up and over the
wall.

526
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:29,712
MATT: Okay. You come up over the top of the wall.
As you get up over the top, immediately you see

527
00:35:29,712 --> 00:35:35,005
they have two large ballistae. The number of
ballistae installed throughout the walls here, two

528
00:35:35,005 --> 00:35:40,332
of them have already been torn apart and whoever
was manning them is lying on the ground, torn open

529
00:35:40,332 --> 00:35:44,679
and dead. But you do also see other dead
lizardmen. It looks like a fight has been

530
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:48,409
going on for a short time here and has been a back
and forth. As you guys come into the main courtyard,

531
00:35:48,409 --> 00:35:55,184
you find the ground is charred with small flames
that are still burning on bushes, and elements of

532
00:35:55,184 --> 00:36:00,491
piles of broken wood and things that were part of
the encampment that just caught fire. You can see

533
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:06,981
groups of lizardmen battling various soldiers,
some of them still screaming and the sound of

534
00:36:06,981 --> 00:36:12,586
lizard-like battle cries as they charge in,
slamming weapon against weapon, shield against

535
00:36:12,586 --> 00:36:19,183
face. This is an actual small-scale war happening
inside here. It's hard to tell which side is

536
00:36:19,183 --> 00:36:23,091
winning. A lot of the soldiers are better-trained,
but occasionally you watch as a wyvern swoops down

537
00:36:23,091 --> 00:36:27,859
and picks up a soldier and throws them off the
side, and slams into the ground, no longer

538
00:36:27,859 --> 00:36:29,259
moving.

539
00:36:29,259 --> 00:36:31,033
MARISHA: Do we see anyone we know?

540
00:36:31,033 --> 00:36:32,794
SAM: Where's Elle?

541
00:36:32,794 --> 00:36:34,188
MARISHA: Do we see Allura?

542
00:36:34,188 --> 00:36:36,381
MATT: Perception check.

543
00:36:36,381 --> 00:36:41,700
MARISHA: Come on, opal dice. That's not bad! 26.

544
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,390
SAM: Oh, disadvantage.

545
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:45,130
MATT: Disadvantage for you, buddy.

546
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:46,601
SAM: Oh, okay. 14.

547
00:36:46,601 --> 00:36:52,657
MATT: Okay. So the two of you, as soon as you dart
inside and glance over, you can see nobody that

548
00:36:52,657 --> 00:36:58,682
catches your familiar eye. Everyone who is in
armor is in full armor. They're all in the actual

549
00:36:58,682 --> 00:37:06,811
Fort Daxio defense regalia and they are covered in
blood, they're covered in soot and they are not

550
00:37:06,811 --> 00:37:10,332
paying attention to you because they are fighting
for their lives right now. You can see there are

551
00:37:10,332 --> 00:37:16,314
a number of tents to the side, dried trees that have
burnt out entirely. You can see a number of the

552
00:37:16,314 --> 00:37:19,877
trebuchets that you have repaired earlier that
have already torn down, or at least have suffered

553
00:37:19,877 --> 00:37:22,895
partial damage from fire or other elements,
bludgeoning.

554
00:37:22,895 --> 00:37:31,489
MARISHA: But there doesn't seem to be any tabards
from Emon, or any tabards from Syngorn or anything

555
00:37:31,489 --> 00:37:32,424
like that?

556
00:37:32,424 --> 00:37:38,433
MATT: No. It looks like when this began, currently
only Daxio's army was here. And is here

557
00:37:38,433 --> 00:37:39,491
currently.

558
00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:41,169
MARISHA: I mean, that still sucks. But okay.

559
00:37:41,169 --> 00:37:46,685
MATT: Yeah. You do watch and see as currently,
there is no tension toward you because the battles

560
00:37:46,685 --> 00:37:50,702
happening right now are still happening. You see
multiple soldiers gathering around wyverns that

561
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:55,376
have been dragged to the ground with chain or have
nets thrown over them, and soldiers are gashing, running

562
00:37:55,376 --> 00:37:59,049
up and slashing and stabbing as they can, while the
lizardman carves its way through, and takes its

563
00:37:59,049 --> 00:38:03,511
spear and starts piercing out with its shield. As
you look around, nothing but insanity going

564
00:38:03,511 --> 00:38:05,449
around. What are you guys doing?

565
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:11,043
LAURA: Are there any clusters that look like not a
lot of our soldiers around, just lizardmen? Or is

566
00:38:11,043 --> 00:38:12,651
it all mixed in together?

567
00:38:12,651 --> 00:38:16,467
MATT: It's all mixed in right now. It's a
free-for-all. There's no group of lizardmen

568
00:38:16,467 --> 00:38:18,094
sitting around and waiting out for a target.

569
00:38:18,094 --> 00:38:20,843
LAURA: Are there any wyverns in the sky that don't
see us?

570
00:38:20,843 --> 00:38:25,743
MATT: There are a number of wyverns scattered that
are currently swooping down and being part of the chaos.

571
00:38:25,743 --> 00:38:27,301
MARISHA: About how many wyverns?

572
00:38:27,301 --> 00:38:31,673
MATT: Currently not engaged on the ground? I'd say
about seven.

573
00:38:31,673 --> 00:38:38,143
TRAVIS: Can I go full murderhobo status and find a
group of people on the ground that need help?

574
00:38:38,143 --> 00:38:39,873
MATT: Yeah, totally.

575
00:38:39,873 --> 00:38:42,632
LAURA: I want to try to get a sneak attack on one
of the wyverns.

576
00:38:42,632 --> 00:38:44,963
MARISHA: I'm going to also go for the wyverns.

577
00:38:44,963 --> 00:38:48,238
TALIESIN: I'm going to activate my spider-climbing
boots and going to reload and I'm going to start

578
00:38:48,238 --> 00:38:56,715
walking around and pot-shotting anything on the
ground that's giving trouble. If I see somebody,

579
00:38:56,715 --> 00:38:58,579
I'm shooting until they stop.

580
00:38:58,579 --> 00:39:03,815
MATT: Okay. There are masses of lizardmen in this
area that are in the middle of the fray. As soon

581
00:39:03,815 --> 00:39:08,118
as you guys storm in and start making noise,
making your presence know, a number of them who

582
00:39:08,118 --> 00:39:12,222
are waiting for a way to pierce in and get their
weapons into the last of these soldiers that are

583
00:39:12,222 --> 00:39:16,486
fighting off, as best they can, the last
stand they have here at the outside of Fort Daxio,

584
00:39:16,486 --> 00:39:20,745
some of them turn over their shoulders and see you
and start rushing in. You guys, with ranged

585
00:39:20,745 --> 00:39:23,062
weapons, you go first. Go ahead and roll attacks
on this.

586
00:39:23,062 --> 00:39:26,074
LAURA: I get advantage because the wyverns
don't see me, right?

587
00:39:26,074 --> 00:39:28,169
MATT: The wyverns have not seen you.

588
00:39:28,169 --> 00:39:30,011
LAURA: Okay.

589
00:39:30,011 --> 00:39:33,771
MATT: Actually, make a stealth check, just to make
sure you've made your way in carefully. They're

590
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:36,366
not paying attention to you, but they may or may
not see you out of their peripheral.

591
00:39:36,366 --> 00:39:38,006
LAURA: 19.

592
00:39:38,006 --> 00:39:40,078
MATT: Okay, yeah. The one you're aiming at has not
seen you.

593
00:39:40,078 --> 00:39:43,758
LAURA: Okay. 33.

594
00:39:43,758 --> 00:39:45,416
MATT: 33 hits.

595
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:51,338
TALIESIN: I am going to cast on whatever the
biggest one is, and I'm going to cast Hex, which I

596
00:39:51,338 --> 00:39:59,154
still have. And I'm taking my first shot. 28.

597
00:39:59,154 --> 00:40:01,090
MATT: 28 hits.

598
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:04,029
TALIESIN: Gun jam!

599
00:40:04,029 --> 00:40:05,965
TRAVIS: Damn it!

600
00:40:05,965 --> 00:40:11,540
LAURA: 31. 31 on the first hit.

601
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:13,031
TALIESIN: I take five points of damage.

602
00:40:13,031 --> 00:40:14,409
MATT: Okay. What was that, the first one?

603
00:40:14,409 --> 00:40:15,311
LAURA: 31.

604
00:40:15,311 --> 00:40:16,625
MATT: 31, nice!

605
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:18,538
LAURA: And the same, it's another 35 attack.

606
00:40:18,538 --> 00:40:19,857
MATT: That hits.

607
00:40:19,857 --> 00:40:29,056
TALIESIN: Before I went down, I do 15 points of
damage plus four points of psychic damage before

608
00:40:29,056 --> 00:40:30,717
the gun jammed.

609
00:40:30,717 --> 00:40:32,447
LAURA: 25 on the second.

610
00:40:32,447 --> 00:40:37,963
MATT: 25 damage? Great! So that one you're aiming
at had already taken some damage in the battle.

611
00:40:37,963 --> 00:40:42,467
Its rider had already been torn off of it and it's
basically on automatic tear-and-destroy mode. Both

612
00:40:42,467 --> 00:40:45,949
of your arrows-- one finds the side of its throat.
As it whips its head around to look at the

613
00:40:45,949 --> 00:40:50,646
direction it came with, this one finds the eye at
front of its snout, sinks in, and it slowly, limply

614
00:40:50,646 --> 00:40:54,271
falls out in the air and smashes into the ground,
maybe 25 feet to your right.

615
00:40:54,271 --> 00:40:58,280
TALIESIN: It also would have taken six points 
of necrotic damage to it, so.

616
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,543
MATT: Okay, cool. You're aiming at the same one as
her?

617
00:41:00,543 --> 00:41:01,521
TALIESIN: Yeah.

618
00:41:01,521 --> 00:41:05,127
MATT: You guys (impact). This poor wyvern gets
torn asunder.

619
00:41:05,127 --> 00:41:06,517
TRAVIS: Poor, my ass!

620
00:41:06,517 --> 00:41:08,626
LAURA: Poor your ass!

621
00:41:08,626 --> 00:41:10,897
MATT: (laughs) Poor Travis' ass!

622
00:41:10,897 --> 00:41:14,391
SAM: Tall cup of Travis' ass.

623
00:41:14,391 --> 00:41:20,588
MATT: You watch as a number of these lizardmen,
six to be exact, all start rushing in towards you

624
00:41:20,588 --> 00:41:25,281
guys as they were firing at the wyvern in the air.
What are you guys doing at this point? You just

625
00:41:25,281 --> 00:41:27,338
have a wave of them coming at you right now.

626
00:41:27,338 --> 00:41:29,429
LIAM: I'm following Grog to get his scraps.

627
00:41:29,429 --> 00:41:31,454
MARISHA: They're coming at us?

628
00:41:31,454 --> 00:41:33,804
MATT: Yeah, you guys are still clustered
together.

629
00:41:33,804 --> 00:41:35,497
MARISHA: Is it a group of-- how many?

630
00:41:35,497 --> 00:41:39,364
MATT: Six. They're just charging straight at you.
Some have swords, shields, and spears like

631
00:41:39,364 --> 00:41:40,466
(snarling).

632
00:41:40,466 --> 00:41:44,141
MARISHA: Before anything crazy happens, I'm going
to go ahead and pull up the Spire of Conflux and

633
00:41:44,141 --> 00:41:47,220
I'm going to Fireball right where they are.

634
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:55,626
MATT: As they're charging in, you watch the staff
slam into the ground. As it slams into the ground,

635
00:41:55,626 --> 00:42:00,659
you can see at the very tip, there's a small piece
of crystalline energy that begins to go from a

636
00:42:00,659 --> 00:42:06,582
dull greenish-blue to a bright red. And as it hits
the apex of its glow, a single beam of red energy

637
00:42:06,582 --> 00:42:12,041
streaks forward towards them as they're all
charging. What's the DC on that?

638
00:42:12,041 --> 00:42:15,012
MARISHA: 19.

639
00:42:15,012 --> 00:42:17,226
SAM: 19 on the Spire?!

640
00:42:17,226 --> 00:42:19,783
MATT: Well, it's whatever her spell DC is when she
cast it.

641
00:42:19,783 --> 00:42:21,081
SAM: Damn!

642
00:42:21,081 --> 00:42:29,216
MATT: And no, none of them make it! So go ahead and
roll the damage on that.

643
00:42:29,216 --> 00:42:32,006
MARISHA: Wait, Fireball. I don't know this
damage.

644
00:42:32,006 --> 00:42:34,069
SAM: 8d6. Radius 20.

645
00:42:34,069 --> 00:42:40,299
MARISHA: Give me two. I get to reroll ones, too,
because it's fire damage.

646
00:42:40,299 --> 00:42:41,968
MATT: Yep.

647
00:42:41,968 --> 00:42:46,108
MARISHA: And I got three ones. So those will all
get rerolled.

648
00:42:46,108 --> 00:42:47,442
SAM: Is that true?

649
00:42:47,442 --> 00:42:48,443
MARISHA: That is true.

650
00:42:48,443 --> 00:42:49,965
MATT: It's an ability of the Spire.

651
00:42:49,965 --> 00:42:52,217
TALIESIN: That's nuts.

652
00:42:52,217 --> 00:42:58,535
MARISHA: Ten, 15, 25 points.

653
00:42:58,535 --> 00:42:59,982
MATT: 25 points of damage?

654
00:42:59,982 --> 00:43:02,211
SAM: There's another six up there, the red one.

655
00:43:02,211 --> 00:43:08,694
MARISHA: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight! 25, 30 points of damage.

656
00:43:08,694 --> 00:43:09,956
MATT: 30 points of fire damage.

657
00:43:09,956 --> 00:43:11,068
MARISHA: Thanks, Sam!

658
00:43:11,068 --> 00:43:12,938
MATT; As you guys are getting your weapons ready,
you have both your daggers out at the side. You

659
00:43:12,938 --> 00:43:17,543
have your axe at the batter-up position. You watch
as suddenly they burst into red flame and a number

660
00:43:17,543 --> 00:43:21,378
of their charred, burning bodies tumble to the
ground, motionless. As the fire subsides, all six

661
00:43:21,378 --> 00:43:23,496
have been destroyed by the blast from the
Fireball.

662
00:43:23,496 --> 00:43:28,128
TRAVIS: That's what we were going to do, right?
Yeah! That's basically what we had in mind.

663
00:43:28,128 --> 00:43:30,532
LIAM: This knife does the same fucking thing.

664
00:43:30,532 --> 00:43:38,666
TRAVIS: I thought so. I've see it happen. Really,
I have. Impressive, Keyleth. Impressive. Yeah.

665
00:43:38,666 --> 00:43:42,616
Point it towards the enemies, okay?

666
00:43:42,616 --> 00:43:49,974
MATT: As the chaos is still happening, you watch
as another blast of flame explodes on the top

667
00:43:49,974 --> 00:43:55,626
tower that is the front of the fortress itself,
and you hear what sounds like dual Wilhelm screams

668
00:43:55,626 --> 00:44:01,631
as two guys who were situated on the top, running
to of the ballista, get blown off and both slam

669
00:44:01,631 --> 00:44:08,117
into the ground, faces and necks snapped from the
impact on the floor. Looking up in that direction,

670
00:44:08,117 --> 00:44:13,348
you watch as another streak of bluish-green arcane
energy shoots up a few hundred feet into the sky,

671
00:44:13,348 --> 00:44:16,980
and it (poof), as a sort of signal for them.

672
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:18,545
MARISHA: No, no, no!

673
00:44:18,545 --> 00:44:25,847
MATT: You look up top as you see one wyvern is
curling its way, perched up on the edge of it. And

674
00:44:25,847 --> 00:44:35,440
there, jumping onto its back, you see an elf. An
elf with longish, blonde hair. Robes that are

675
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,305
bloodied. It gets up and holds onto the reins.

676
00:44:38,305 --> 00:44:40,401
SAM: How far?

677
00:44:40,401 --> 00:44:45,140
MATT: At this point? He's probably about 80 feet
from you. You guys are halfway across the

678
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,101
courtyard to the actual fortress.

679
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:48,351
LIAM: He's up on the wall?

680
00:44:48,351 --> 00:44:49,953
SAM: Can I shoot him with lightning?

681
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:51,844
MATT: If you want to get close.

682
00:44:51,844 --> 00:44:54,422
SAM: I mean, that's a 100-foot range.

683
00:44:54,422 --> 00:44:55,952
MATT: So, yes. You could.

684
00:44:55,952 --> 00:44:57,779
SAM: He's a bad guy?

685
00:44:57,779 --> 00:44:59,534
LAURA: I don't know!

686
00:44:59,534 --> 00:45:01,577
MARISHA: He's on a wyvern, so I'm going to say
maybe.

687
00:45:01,577 --> 00:45:03,199
LAURA: Can I shoot him with a Bramble Shot?

688
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:04,466
MATT: About 45 feet up.

689
00:45:04,466 --> 00:45:05,866
LAURA: I want to try to shoot him with a Bramble
Shot.

690
00:45:05,866 --> 00:45:06,861
MATT: Shoot him?

691
00:45:06,861 --> 00:45:07,705
LAURA: Yeah!

692
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:08,406
MATT: Okay!

693
00:45:08,406 --> 00:45:10,722
SAM: He's on a bad wyvern, right? This is a bad
guy.

694
00:45:10,722 --> 00:45:11,713
LAURA: I think so.

695
00:45:11,713 --> 00:45:15,380
MATT: For the purposes of this, guys, we're going
to go ahead and roll initiative.

696
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:18,080
LAURA: He's a bad guy!

697
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,942
MATT: Well, you don't know if he's a bad guy or
not! But he's on the battlefield.

698
00:45:20,942 --> 00:45:24,976
LAURA: That's why I'm Bramble Shotting him.
Because I'm trying to tangle him up.

699
00:45:24,976 --> 00:45:35,128
MATT: Pike has been having a hard time keeping up
with everyone with her tiny, short legs.

700
00:45:35,128 --> 00:45:36,526
LAURA: Pike!

701
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:39,180
MARISHA: Come on, Pike! Come on!

702
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:41,126
TALIESIN: I'm rolling really poorly.

703
00:45:41,126 --> 00:45:43,653
TRAVIS: Yeah, me too.

704
00:45:43,653 --> 00:45:45,646
LAURA: Do you have your snitch?

705
00:45:45,646 --> 00:45:47,342
TALIESIN: Yeah. It's just rolling poorly.

706
00:45:47,342 --> 00:45:48,681
LAURA: Do you want one of mine?

707
00:45:48,681 --> 00:45:49,750
TALIESIN: No, no.

708
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,231
TRAVIS: Take your clothes off, Taliesin, reset.

709
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:53,387
SAM: I'll take my clothes off. If it'll inspire
us.

710
00:45:53,387 --> 00:45:56,034
LAURA: Oh, no. What is it? Do it, Sam!

711
00:45:56,034 --> 00:45:58,400
TRAVIS: Do it slowly. Do it.

712
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:03,084
(yelling)

713
00:46:03,084 --> 00:46:07,029
TRAVIS: Holy fuck!

714
00:46:07,029 --> 00:46:09,956
LIAM: Triple disadvantage for the night!

715
00:46:09,956 --> 00:46:12,363
TALIESIN: We're dead, we're going to die.

716
00:46:12,363 --> 00:46:13,897
SAM: It's on.

717
00:46:13,897 --> 00:46:17,232
(laughter)

718
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:21,604
TRAVIS: For the rest of the game, you've got to
look at that--

719
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:25,854
LIAM: May the odds be ever in your favor.

720
00:46:25,854 --> 00:46:28,060
(laughter)

721
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:31,557
MATT: Forgot to mention the new GM Tips episode is
out this week, talking about how to deal with

722
00:46:31,557 --> 00:46:32,832
Player Character deaths.

723
00:46:32,832 --> 00:46:35,152
(laughter)

724
00:46:35,152 --> 00:46:37,584
SAM: Oh, man! If I died in this shirt, it would be
the worst way.

725
00:46:37,584 --> 00:46:39,663
(laughter)

726
00:46:39,663 --> 00:46:44,887
MATT: Oh my god! Sam! Sam!

727
00:46:44,887 --> 00:46:48,118
LIAM: We've never seen the picture at
that size. And it makes me want to Goonies-style

728
00:46:48,118 --> 00:46:50,245
cut a hole in the mouth.

729
00:46:50,245 --> 00:46:56,869
MATT: No one should ever say, "I want to cut a
hole in the mouth of a picture of you." I do want

730
00:46:56,869 --> 00:46:59,224
to say that is pretty much life-size, which is
really creepy.

731
00:46:59,224 --> 00:47:03,195
SAM: I wish I could do what Travis can do with his
pecs, but I--

732
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:05,147
(laughter)

733
00:47:05,147 --> 00:47:06,490
TRAVIS: You're there, you're there.

734
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:13,803
MATT: With you guys on the battlefield, let's roll
initiative.

735
00:47:13,803 --> 00:47:17,381
ALL: We did.

736
00:47:17,381 --> 00:47:18,884
TRAVIS: We have to do it again?

737
00:47:18,884 --> 00:47:20,936
TALIESIN: I'd love to do it again.

738
00:47:20,936 --> 00:47:22,280
MATT: (sing-song) Sorry!

739
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:26,176
MARISHA: That was funny.

740
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:28,297
MATT: You guys.

741
00:47:28,297 --> 00:47:40,440
SAM: He's a bad guy, right? I mean, we can kill
him, right?

742
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,103
TRAVIS: Kill him anyway. And find out later.

743
00:47:42,103 --> 00:47:45,395
TALIESIN: We can also take out his ride.

744
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:47,600
LAURA: Yeah, we can take out the wyvern.

745
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:50,730
MATT: 25 to 20?

746
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:51,889
LAURA: 25.

747
00:47:51,889 --> 00:47:53,142
LIAM: 22.

748
00:47:53,142 --> 00:47:58,760
MATT: Nice. 20 to 15?

749
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,350
MARISHA: 15.

750
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:03,679
MATT: I need someone to roll for Pike, by the
way.

751
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:12,856
LAURA: Eight. I don't know what Pike's initiative
is.

752
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:17,978
MATT: I think it's plus one, so add that-- Nine.
All right. So 15 to ten?

753
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:19,659
TALIESIN: 13. Oh, go ahead.

754
00:48:19,659 --> 00:48:20,886
SAM: Oh, 11.

755
00:48:20,886 --> 00:48:25,055
TALIESIN: I don't have my sword working.

756
00:48:25,055 --> 00:48:27,342
MATT: Grog, what did you get?

757
00:48:27,342 --> 00:48:28,610
TRAVIS: Eight.

758
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:33,461
LAURA: Aww, you and Pike fighting together.

759
00:48:33,461 --> 00:48:52,440
MATT: Top of the round, as you see this figure get
onto the wyvern up top. Bloodied, grabbing on

760
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:55,048
to the reins, looking over the top, Vex, you're up
first.

761
00:48:55,048 --> 00:48:56,843
LAURA: I'm going to shoot a Bramble Shot at him.

762
00:48:56,843 --> 00:48:59,462
MATT: Okay.

763
00:48:59,462 --> 00:49:02,121
LAURA: 20?

764
00:49:02,121 --> 00:49:05,036
MATT: 20. Hits.

765
00:49:05,036 --> 00:49:11,042
TRAVIS: This man, this man is an elf, right?

766
00:49:11,042 --> 00:49:27,688
LAURA: 16. And then the DC is 16.

767
00:49:27,754 --> 00:49:33,652
MATT: 16 damage and DC of 16. Is it
strength?

768
00:49:33,727 --> 00:49:35,447
LAURA: Yeah.

769
00:49:35,447 --> 00:49:37,888
MATT: No, that's a 15.

770
00:49:37,888 --> 00:49:40,217
LAURA: Oh! Then he's restrained!

771
00:49:40,217 --> 00:49:42,170
MATT: Does he take additional damage from the
Bramble Shot?

772
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:43,832
LAURA: Yeah, he takes 16 damage.

773
00:49:43,832 --> 00:49:46,900
MATT: 16 total from the shot, okay.

774
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,653
LAURA: 16 damage from the shot, as far as I know.

775
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:53,431
MATT: It's your normal arrow damage plus whatever
it tells you to roll on that.

776
00:49:53,431 --> 00:49:55,301
LAURA: I get another of my arrow damage?

777
00:49:55,301 --> 00:49:57,194
MATT: It's your arrow damage, and then that on top
of it.

778
00:49:57,194 --> 00:50:00,422
LAURA: What?! I didn't know that! That's so cool!

779
00:50:00,422 --> 00:50:08,320
LIAM: How far is he from us at this point?

780
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,267
MATT: At this point, he's--

781
00:50:10,267 --> 00:50:12,303
LAURA: Is it sneak attack?

782
00:50:12,303 --> 00:50:14,700
MATT: He did not see you, so yes.

783
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:19,858
SAM: What are you restraining?

784
00:50:19,858 --> 00:50:31,349
LAURA: The thing on top. Hopefully he doesn't have
a hold of the reins, so-- Now I've lost track. 28

785
00:50:31,349 --> 00:50:35,053
damage plus the 16 from the Bramble Shot.

786
00:50:35,053 --> 00:50:44,458
MATT: Gotcha. As you reach out and fire the arrow,
you watch him glance over the wall. His eyes go

787
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:53,254
wide as the arrow (impact) pierces his chest and
sprouts into 20 to 25 tiny bramble-like vines that

788
00:50:53,254 --> 00:50:58,009
wrap around him and wrap around his body as he
gets pushed back and falls off the back of the

789
00:50:58,009 --> 00:51:01,952
wyvern, out of sight. Make a perception check.

790
00:51:01,952 --> 00:51:08,770
LAURA: Okay. 21?

791
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:14,271
MATT: Okay. As you see his expression as he falls
back, it jogs your memory a little bit. You do

792
00:51:14,271 --> 00:51:19,977
recognize him. This is Gatekeeper Xanthas. He was
the gatekeeper at the Traverse Junction in the

793
00:51:19,977 --> 00:51:24,550
Emon Alabaster Lyceum, the place that had the
Teleportation Circles, the guy who was always at

794
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:25,878
the desk waiting for you every time.

795
00:51:25,878 --> 00:51:28,002
LAURA: Oh, that guy! That was annoyed with us
every time we--

796
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:29,238
MARISHA: He hated us?

797
00:51:29,238 --> 00:51:30,839
MATT: He was annoyed with you.

798
00:51:30,839 --> 00:51:32,324
MARISHA: He hated us. What's his name?

799
00:51:32,324 --> 00:51:38,600
MATT: Xanthas. Gatekeeper Xanthas. You watch him
just get thrown off the back of the wyvern,

800
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,282
slammed past, out of sight.

801
00:51:41,282 --> 00:51:46,743
MARISHA: Hey, wonder why we hated him, we can't
remember his name, Seeker Xanthas.

802
00:51:46,743 --> 00:51:51,063
SAM: Huh, why is he here? Odd.

803
00:51:51,063 --> 00:51:52,618
LAURA: I don't know.

804
00:51:52,618 --> 00:51:56,281
MARISHA: Well, if he's from Emon, and Emon is
currently under Thordak's reign--

805
00:51:56,281 --> 00:51:58,291
LAURA: Yeah, he's probably working for him.

806
00:51:58,291 --> 00:52:02,222
TRAVIS: I think we should trust him.

807
00:52:02,222 --> 00:52:05,440
LAURA: We should definitely trust him.

808
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:09,810
TALIESIN: He's currently a veggie burrito at the
moment, let's keep him that way.

809
00:52:09,810 --> 00:52:12,867
LAURA: Should I fly towards him?

810
00:52:12,916 --> 00:52:16,646
TALIESIN: I dunno. Why are you asking--?

811
00:52:16,646 --> 00:52:19,594
LAURA: I'm going to fly. I'm going to try get
towards him.

812
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:21,575
TALIESIN: I'm having my own problem.

813
00:52:21,575 --> 00:52:32,100
MATT: So, at full speed on your broom, broom speed
is what again? It should be on the broom.

814
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:41,922
LAURA: I don't have a broom paper. I never got a
broom paper because I kind of stole it. It wasn't

815
00:52:41,922 --> 00:52:43,098
given to me.

816
00:52:43,098 --> 00:52:46,192
MATT: I'm sure it does have one. I'll look it up
right now, but you need to keep in mind what

817
00:52:46,192 --> 00:52:47,483
your movement is on your broom.

818
00:52:47,483 --> 00:52:49,327
LAURA: I think it's like 120.

819
00:52:49,327 --> 00:52:53,060
MARISHA: It's, like, exactly what I need to get
there.

820
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:57,627
How far away is he? It's that much.

821
00:52:57,627 --> 00:52:58,965
MATT: It's like, ten

822
00:52:58,965 --> 00:53:00,958
TRAVIS: It's 40. I'm saying it's 40.

823
00:53:00,958 --> 00:53:02,507
LAURA: No. It's, I'd say, 50.

824
00:53:02,507 --> 00:53:04,435
MATT: Flying speed: 50 feet.

825
00:53:04,435 --> 00:53:06,472
TRAVIS: Don't raise your hand like you got it
right.

826
00:53:06,472 --> 00:53:08,899
LAURA: I did! I said 50, right before he said it.

827
00:53:08,899 --> 00:53:11,666
SAM: Yes, you also said ten, 120, 180 and 50.

828
00:53:11,666 --> 00:53:20,778
TRAVIS: It's playing Rock-Paper-Scissors and
going-- Got it!

829
00:53:20,778 --> 00:53:31,348
MATT: As you rush in on the broom and look over,
the wyvern still has its claws up on the edge of

830
00:53:31,348 --> 00:53:36,898
the walls, (snarls), looking around. You can see
it's taken a few hits, a few arrows sticking out

831
00:53:36,898 --> 00:53:44,270
of it. However, from the explosion that happened,
the two ballistae up there don't appear to be

832
00:53:44,270 --> 00:53:49,491
damaged. But you have no current view of Xanthas.

833
00:53:49,491 --> 00:53:50,855
LAURA: Okay.

834
00:53:50,855 --> 00:53:53,394
MATT: So, that ending your turn, that brings us to
Vax.

835
00:53:53,394 --> 00:53:59,132
LIAM: Jeez. How far away is that little rock right
at the bottom of that platform that you've got Vex

836
00:53:59,132 --> 00:54:00,771
on? How far is that from me?

837
00:54:00,771 --> 00:54:05,654
MATT: That rock? It's about maybe 40 feet?

838
00:54:05,654 --> 00:54:07,591
LIAM: And how high is the wall?

839
00:54:07,591 --> 00:54:10,520
MATT: Up here? Probably about 30 feet tall.

840
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:16,347
LIAM: Okay. Do I see any wood or anything, a
barrel or anything besides stone sticking out?

841
00:54:16,347 --> 00:54:21,989
MATT: No. Not in that rock, no. It's a piece of
stone that's sticking out.

842
00:54:21,989 --> 00:54:26,663
LIAM: I am going to hold everything until the rest
of the party goes this round.

843
00:54:26,663 --> 00:54:29,048
MATT: Okay. Keyleth?

844
00:54:29,048 --> 00:54:32,628
MARISHA: Okay. Is there anyone else coming at us?

845
00:54:32,628 --> 00:54:41,756
MATT: Currently, no.There are a number of the
wyvern riders and-- going to place these guys over

846
00:54:41,756 --> 00:54:46,445
here so I go and do that-- You do see lizardmen
off to the side that are in the middle of a

847
00:54:46,445 --> 00:55:00,452
struggle. A soldier over there, and a number of
lizardmen that are currently bashing at the front

848
00:55:00,452 --> 00:55:03,418
gates, trying to get through the main door into
the--

849
00:55:03,418 --> 00:55:10,517
MARISHA: Okay. Where did you say where the wyvern
riders were, again? Roughly, in the air?

850
00:55:10,517 --> 00:55:17,477
MATT: You have three that are on the ground right
now that have nets thrown over them or chains

851
00:55:17,477 --> 00:55:21,187
pulled across, holding them down. And there are a
number that are high up in the air right

852
00:55:21,187 --> 00:55:25,876
now, circling, looking for a way to swoop down and
grab somebody. A few have their eyes on Vex.

853
00:55:25,876 --> 00:55:28,539
MARISHA: Are they clustering together?

854
00:55:28,539 --> 00:55:31,232
MATT: They're maybe 40 feet apart right now.

855
00:55:31,232 --> 00:55:35,994
MARISHA: Oh, yeah? They're each 40
feet?

856
00:55:35,994 --> 00:55:37,302
MATT: At the least.

857
00:55:37,302 --> 00:55:42,345
MARISHA: Fuck. Okay, you know what? And how far
away am I from them?

858
00:55:42,345 --> 00:55:46,677
MATT: From the closest one to you? About 80 feet.

859
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:48,441
MARISHA: Jesus.

860
00:55:48,441 --> 00:55:51,674
TALIESIN: We have to start moving in a direction.

861
00:55:51,674 --> 00:55:54,090
TRAVIS: Towards the door, right? And then try to
get the--

862
00:55:54,090 --> 00:56:01,932
MARISHA: I was going to try and get these guys
out, but okay. How many are busting through the

863
00:56:01,932 --> 00:56:03,551
door? How many lizardmen?

864
00:56:03,551 --> 00:56:07,658
MATT: There are currently six pushed against it.
And there are a few that are moving off in this

865
00:56:07,658 --> 00:56:10,030
direction to go join them.

866
00:56:10,030 --> 00:56:11,621
MARISHA: To bust through. Those are bad guys?

867
00:56:11,621 --> 00:56:15,020
MATT: Yeah. They're currently slamming into the
door and hitting it and trying to find their way through.

868
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:18,119
MARISHA: Well, let's Fireball them again. That was
fun!

869
00:56:18,119 --> 00:56:19,424
MATT: Okay!

870
00:56:19,424 --> 00:56:21,613
TRAVIS: Will it set the gate on fire?

871
00:56:21,613 --> 00:56:23,710
TALIESIN: Not if you place it right.

872
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:28,008
MATT: From what you can tell and what you remember,
the gate itself is mostly stone and iron.

873
00:56:28,008 --> 00:56:30,433
MARISHA: So let's blow that shit up.

874
00:56:30,433 --> 00:56:45,158
MATT: All right. So keep track of the charges
you're using. They all fail.

875
00:56:45,158 --> 00:56:47,503
MARISHA: I can see both of them.

876
00:56:47,503 --> 00:56:51,500
TRAVIS: They all fail?

877
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:54,421
MATT: Yeah, they all fail. Rolling nothing tonight.

878
00:56:54,421 --> 00:57:04,446
MARISHA: Oh, I have another eight. All of them?
All six of them? I'm drunk with power. It's 6d8?

879
00:57:04,446 --> 00:57:05,647
SAM: No, 8d6.

880
00:57:05,647 --> 00:57:09,253
MARISHA: 8d6! (counts)

881
00:57:09,253 --> 00:57:10,639
TALIESIN: Reroll.

882
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:12,166
MARISHA: Yeah, I get to reroll ones.

883
00:57:12,166 --> 00:57:13,647
SAM: Cocked.

884
00:57:13,647 --> 00:57:19,497
MARISHA: That's also cocked. That one bumped it
from what it was--

885
00:57:19,497 --> 00:57:20,674
SAM: It was a four.

886
00:57:20,674 --> 00:57:34,399
MARISHA: It was a four, okay. So six, ten, 18, 20,
five, 30 again. No, 31!

887
00:57:34,399 --> 00:57:42,541
MATT: 31. (explosion) This one seed of arcane red
energy that shoots forth from the staff slams into

888
00:57:42,541 --> 00:57:46,083
the door, and you watch as they're all thrown
backwards, screaming through the air, the blast

889
00:57:46,083 --> 00:57:49,012
incinerating their bodies and scattering them to
the four winds.

890
00:57:49,012 --> 00:57:50,690
LAURA: Fucking shit, Keyleth!

891
00:57:50,690 --> 00:57:52,943
LIAM: Fire walk with me, Red.

892
00:57:52,943 --> 00:57:56,401
MARISHA: I feel like this thing should come with a
child warning. Oh, jeez.

893
00:57:56,401 --> 00:57:59,701
TRAVIS: Wait, that smoked all of them?

894
00:57:59,701 --> 00:58:04,276
MATT: All of those there, yeah. You see groups of
wyvern riders that are currently fighting off the

895
00:58:04,276 --> 00:58:07,555
guards. Keyleth, do you want to move or are you
staying there?

896
00:58:07,555 --> 00:58:11,401
MARISHA: We were all running towards the door,
right? We're all trying to get in?

897
00:58:11,401 --> 00:58:12,541
MATT: That's up to you.

898
00:58:12,541 --> 00:58:13,822
MARISHA: We're all trying to get in?

899
00:58:13,822 --> 00:58:15,066
TALIESIN: I'm heading that way.

900
00:58:15,066 --> 00:58:16,222
MARISHA: I start heading that way.

901
00:58:16,222 --> 00:58:17,522
MATT: All right.

902
00:58:17,522 --> 00:58:19,737
MARISHA: Why'd you say it so nonchalant?

903
00:58:19,737 --> 00:58:21,273
LAURA: Oh no, oh no!

904
00:58:21,273 --> 00:58:23,013
MARISHA: It's always like it's a bad idea.

905
00:58:23,013 --> 00:58:26,067
MATT: I'm asking if you'd-- Vax stayed there. Up
to you.

906
00:58:26,067 --> 00:58:27,636
MARISHA: Well, he held his turn.

907
00:58:27,636 --> 00:58:30,645
LIAM: Yep. I can't do anything now. I have to wait
until everyone's done.

908
00:58:30,645 --> 00:58:34,799
MATT: Yeah. You are staying here. All right, ends
Keyleth's turn, Percival, what are you doing?

909
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:37,409
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my action to try and
clear my gun.

910
00:58:37,409 --> 00:58:40,323
MATT: Okay. Tinkering check.

911
00:58:40,323 --> 00:58:50,690
TALIESIN: Tinkering check, so that's nice. It's
18! It's fine!

912
00:58:50,690 --> 00:58:53,056
MATT: All right. You get the gun to function.

913
00:58:53,056 --> 00:58:58,244
TALIESIN: I take six steps forward.

914
00:58:58,244 --> 00:59:01,050
SAM: (sings) I take six steps back.

915
00:59:01,050 --> 00:59:02,659
TALIESIN: And then I use my bonus action...

916
00:59:02,659 --> 00:59:04,220
LIAM, LAURA and SAM: (singing) We go together
because--

917
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:06,567
ALL: (singing) --opposites attract! And you
know--

918
00:59:06,567 --> 00:59:07,806
MATT: It's not your turn, Scanlan.

919
00:59:07,806 --> 00:59:09,135
SAM: Oh, sorry.

920
00:59:09,135 --> 00:59:11,077
(laughter)

921
00:59:11,077 --> 00:59:17,790
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my bonus action to move
my Hex to one of the wyverns that is currently

922
00:59:17,790 --> 00:59:18,967
under the net.

923
00:59:18,967 --> 00:59:20,574
MATT: Right here? The wyvern or the rider?

924
00:59:20,574 --> 00:59:24,271
TALIESIN: The wyvern. Yeah. It's fighting
everybody too, right?

925
00:59:24,271 --> 00:59:25,958
MATT: Correct. It's thrashing about.

926
00:59:25,958 --> 00:59:28,066
TALIESIN: Okay, it's going to make life easier for
everybody.

927
00:59:28,066 --> 00:59:31,421
MATT: Cool. So that finishes your round then,
Percy. Scanlan, now it's your turn.

928
00:59:31,421 --> 00:59:41,022
SAM: Oh! I'll move forward with the rest of the
gang, if I can. I don't know. I'll Lightning Bolt

929
00:59:41,022 --> 00:59:49,751
the wyvern up there who was holding the elf. Not
knowing what he is or if he's good or bad.

930
00:59:49,751 --> 00:59:55,495
MATT: You're rushing forward on your tiny, gnome
feet, arm out in front, release a bolt of energy

931
00:59:55,495 --> 01:00:01,856
that slams into the front of the edge of the tower
itself. And as you coast it upward, it burns a

932
01:00:01,856 --> 01:00:07,998
dark spot across the stonework before slamming
into the wyvern itself. The wyvern tries to dodge

933
01:00:07,998 --> 01:00:10,428
out of the way. What is the DC on that?

934
01:00:10,428 --> 01:00:14,146
SAM: That would be 19, since I didn't call it.

935
01:00:14,146 --> 01:00:15,604
MATT: That's true.

936
01:00:15,604 --> 01:00:17,383
TRAVIS: (sings) That's true.

937
01:00:17,383 --> 01:00:20,205
MATT: (sings) That's true. (speaking) No, it
does not succeed!

938
01:00:20,205 --> 01:00:22,735
SAM: Okay.

939
01:00:22,735 --> 01:00:25,713
MATT: It has no dex bonus, so it's a straight 15.

940
01:00:25,713 --> 01:00:38,250
SAM: 8d6? Wow! 37!

941
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:47,336
MATT: (explosion) It hits the wyvern, who's
already taken a few blows. It shrieks back, looks

942
01:00:47,336 --> 01:00:54,050
down, its eyes zeroed in on you, its wings out,
looks like it's about to go into a jumping dive.

943
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:56,789
Okay.

944
01:00:56,789 --> 01:01:02,720
SAM: Oh, I will also inspire Vax with a
dirty limerick.

945
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,304
LIAM: Give it to me.

946
01:01:04,304 --> 01:01:05,900
SAM: So, this is a random--

947
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:12,100
There was a young lady named Spruce/ whose
favorite thrill was a goose/ Just the sight of a

948
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:18,067
thumb/ made her tuchus all numb/ and her bowels
got excited and loose.

949
01:01:18,067 --> 01:01:20,545
TRAVIS: Oh god! (groans in disgust)

950
01:01:20,545 --> 01:01:21,620
TALIESIN: Why? Why?!

951
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:23,669
TRAVIS: Where did you? Where?! What?!

952
01:01:23,669 --> 01:01:25,346
LIAM: I feel so brave.

953
01:01:25,346 --> 01:01:27,812
(laughter)

954
01:01:27,812 --> 01:01:34,144
SAM: Let that story inspire you, Vax! Don't be
loose like her bowels! Be firm like a mighty oak!

955
01:01:34,144 --> 01:01:35,763
(laughter)

956
01:01:35,763 --> 01:01:37,921
LIAM: I stand a full inch taller now.

957
01:01:37,921 --> 01:01:39,659
MATT: You do. And take your d12 inspiration die.

958
01:01:39,659 --> 01:01:46,081
TALIESIN: This is not what this book was meant
for!

959
01:01:46,081 --> 01:01:48,395
LIAM: It's from the frogurt shop.

960
01:01:48,395 --> 01:01:51,556
(laughter)

961
01:01:51,556 --> 01:01:55,201
MARISHA: His ability to weaponize things--

962
01:01:55,201 --> 01:01:57,500
TALIESIN: I'm going to get a volume for next
Christmas.

963
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:12,807
MATT: All righty. And with that, ending your turn,
the wyvern up at the top swoops down, right up to

964
01:02:12,807 --> 01:02:16,615
you, Scanlan. Mouth open, stinger out to the
side.

965
01:02:16,615 --> 01:02:18,771
SAM: I'll Cutting Words this one.

966
01:02:18,771 --> 01:02:25,509
MATT: Okay. Well, its bite goes to strike you and
I can almost guarantee you it misses with a 14.

967
01:02:25,509 --> 01:02:29,632
The stinger, however (whoosh).

968
01:02:29,632 --> 01:02:31,475
SAM: Oh wait! No, no. That hits.

969
01:02:31,475 --> 01:02:34,824
TALIESIN: You have a plus two.

970
01:02:34,824 --> 01:02:40,658
SAM: No, I think I only have a plus two if I-- No,
I think it's a straight 14 because I don't wear

971
01:02:40,658 --> 01:02:42,189
anything anymore.

972
01:02:42,189 --> 01:02:43,760
MATT: That's true, you didn't-- All right, so.

973
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,153
LAURA: You took off <i>all</i> your armor?

974
01:02:45,153 --> 01:02:46,235
SAM: Yeah.

975
01:02:46,235 --> 01:02:48,446
LAURA: If you have the armor on, it doesn't have
to be attuned, you still get some--

976
01:02:48,446 --> 01:02:52,242
SAM: I think I'm at 12, plus the armor that I'm
wearing is plus two, so.

977
01:02:52,242 --> 01:02:54,327
MATT: So it's 14. That does hit you exactly,
yeah.

978
01:02:54,327 --> 01:02:57,572
SAM: But I said I was going to Cutting Words it,
which probably should help.

979
01:02:57,572 --> 01:02:59,504
MATT: Go for it. So go ahead and--

980
01:02:59,504 --> 01:03:02,092
SAM: Eight.

981
01:03:02,092 --> 01:03:06,103
MATT: Eight. Okay. The bite goes to clamp down,
and as you--

982
01:03:06,103 --> 01:03:16,180
SAM: Oh! As I look at him, I-- shit! I-- Ah! I
just show him my chest hair. I tuft it out into a

983
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:18,717
quick little ponytail.

984
01:03:18,717 --> 01:03:24,759
MATT: The wyvern pulls back its head, confused,
and the jaw snaps shut as it rears, its wings out,

985
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:32,005
strangely. Its tail comes back, angrily. How
many bardic inspiration die have you spent since

986
01:03:32,005 --> 01:03:33,452
your last battle, by the way?

987
01:03:33,452 --> 01:03:39,627
SAM: I only spent one on the last battle. I did a
bunch of reactions last battle, but I only used

988
01:03:39,627 --> 01:03:41,929
one inspiration last battle.

989
01:03:41,929 --> 01:03:44,123
MATT: Right. Cutting Words also uses a bardic
inspiration, I believe--

990
01:03:44,123 --> 01:03:45,601
SAM: Oh, it does? Then this is five.

991
01:03:45,601 --> 01:03:47,448
MATT: I believe... Let me check.

992
01:03:47,448 --> 01:03:51,907
SAM: I used three Cutting Words last time, and one
inspiration.

993
01:03:51,907 --> 01:03:59,503
MATT: Yeah, you have to use your bardic
inspiration dice. So that's five.

994
01:03:59,503 --> 01:04:03,517
SAM: So this is five. And I think I have six
total? No?

995
01:04:03,517 --> 01:04:06,976
MATT: You get as many as your wisdom modifier--
I'm sorry, your charisma modifier.

996
01:04:06,976 --> 01:04:10,545
SAM: That's six. So yeah, I have one more.

997
01:04:10,545 --> 01:04:21,292
MATT: One more. So the stinger comes swooping down
towards you, and that is a nine! It rolled a two.

998
01:04:21,292 --> 01:04:24,754
The tail whips past your head, no impact.

999
01:04:24,754 --> 01:04:27,705
LAURA: You're just so teeny, Scanlan.

1000
01:04:27,705 --> 01:04:29,270
SAM: I am.

1001
01:04:29,270 --> 01:04:40,107
MATT: Pike's turn! Pike rushing forward as
(panting). Looking around, who here looks pretty

1002
01:04:40,107 --> 01:04:41,550
rough, if anybody?

1003
01:04:41,550 --> 01:04:42,550
LAURA: Percy.

1004
01:04:42,550 --> 01:04:44,434
TALIESIN: I'm a little rough, I could use some
love.

1005
01:04:44,434 --> 01:04:46,024
MARISHA: And I could use some love.

1006
01:04:46,024 --> 01:04:48,571
TALIESIN: Yeah, either of us. I'm a little lower
than you. But you're--

1007
01:04:48,571 --> 01:04:50,923
MARISHA: I'm running with Percy.

1008
01:04:50,923 --> 01:04:52,912
TALIESIN: Yeah. We're together.

1009
01:04:52,912 --> 01:04:54,520
MARISHA: If she wants to give us a group hug?

1010
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:57,146
MATT: Well, she can only get up to you right now,
Keyleth, at the moment.

1011
01:04:57,146 --> 01:04:58,264
MARISHA: Oh.

1012
01:04:58,264 --> 01:04:59,636
MATT: Because of her stumpy legs.

1013
01:04:59,636 --> 01:05:00,726
MARISHA: Sorry.

1014
01:05:00,726 --> 01:05:01,711
TALIESIN: Stumpy legs.

1015
01:05:01,711 --> 01:05:04,140
LAURA: They're slender and fabulous! All right?

1016
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:05,771
SAM: Yeah. They're muscular. Svelte.

1017
01:05:05,771 --> 01:05:07,098
LIAM: Monster calves.

1018
01:05:07,098 --> 01:05:08,377
MATT: Fucking stumpy!

1019
01:05:08,377 --> 01:05:10,976
(laughter)

1020
01:05:10,976 --> 01:05:15,708
MATT: She's going to use her 3rd-level Cure Wounds
on you, Keyleth.

1021
01:05:15,708 --> 01:05:17,220
MARISHA: Aw, thanks, Pike!

1022
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:25,924
MATT: Two eights and a five. This is 16, 21, plus
five. You heal 26 hit points. That was a really

1023
01:05:25,924 --> 01:05:34,171
good healing roll for a level three. All righty.
That ends Pike's turn. Grog, you're up.

1024
01:05:34,171 --> 01:05:40,309
TRAVIS: Yeah! So, I'll run up, because <i>nobody</i>
fucks with Scanlan when I'm around. So I run up to

1025
01:05:40,309 --> 01:05:48,299
the wyvern. Yeah. And I would like to take my axe
and swing it in its stupid face.

1026
01:05:48,299 --> 01:05:49,673
MATT: Go for it.

1027
01:05:49,673 --> 01:05:53,469
TRAVIS: Reckless Attack. Great Weapon Master.

1028
01:05:53,469 --> 01:05:55,603
SAM: Frenzy. Rage.

1029
01:05:55,603 --> 01:05:58,112
LAURA: All of it. (growling) All of it!

1030
01:05:58,112 --> 01:05:59,741
MATT: He's not frenzied yet.

1031
01:05:59,741 --> 01:06:02,343
TRAVIS: 28 minus five is 23.

1032
01:06:02,343 --> 01:06:03,451
MATT: That hits.

1033
01:06:03,451 --> 01:06:04,880
TRAVIS: Okay.

1034
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:06,993
LAURA: How'd you do that, Grog?!

1035
01:06:06,993 --> 01:06:08,187
TRAVIS: Shhh!

1036
01:06:08,187 --> 01:06:09,670
SAM: Doing the math?

1037
01:06:09,670 --> 01:06:12,723
TRAVIS: 25 plus ten is 35.

1038
01:06:12,723 --> 01:06:20,624
MATT: Okay. Second strike, you want to do it? As
you rush and slam the axe into its side, it buries

1039
01:06:20,624 --> 01:06:25,370
a good three inches into the chest, and as it's
pulled back, its tail is still recoiling from the

1040
01:06:25,370 --> 01:06:31,399
attack on Scanlan. Looks back to you and you see
its attention's geared on you, but it's pretty rough.

1041
01:06:31,399 --> 01:06:34,781
TRAVIS: Pretty rough? Yeah! I just want to finish
off this little meat popsicle.

1042
01:06:34,781 --> 01:06:36,125
MATT: Okay, go for it.

1043
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:37,251
TRAVIS: Same thing.

1044
01:06:37,251 --> 01:06:38,284
MATT: Okay.

1045
01:06:38,284 --> 01:06:47,337
TRAVIS: 19 plus a million. 33. No! Minus five.
28.

1046
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:52,892
MATT: 28. As you pull the axe out this time, as
it's rearing back and looking angrily at you, you

1047
01:06:52,892 --> 01:06:58,019
chuckle to yourself as you throw the axe up in the
air. It spins once and you catch it, and you jam

1048
01:06:58,019 --> 01:07:02,431
it right in the center of its skull. It goes from
rearing angrily to lights out. And it hits the

1049
01:07:02,431 --> 01:07:06,134
ground instantaneously, collapsing into a heap as
you wedge the blade out from the center of its

1050
01:07:06,134 --> 01:07:07,305
forehead.

1051
01:07:07,305 --> 01:07:12,702
TRAVIS: Amazing. Can I use my--

1052
01:07:12,702 --> 01:07:16,371
MATT: You still have about 20 feet of movement, by
the way.

1053
01:07:16,371 --> 01:07:21,896
TRAVIS: Can I-- Yeah. I'll move towards the group
on the left.

1054
01:07:21,896 --> 01:07:23,002
MATT: That side?

1055
01:07:23,002 --> 01:07:23,850
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1056
01:07:23,850 --> 01:07:26,089
LAURA: Don't you get an attack again if you killed
something?

1057
01:07:26,089 --> 01:07:31,980
TRAVIS: Oh! Oh! Yes! Thank you! Very good point!
With my bloodaxe, if I kill a creature, I gain ten

1058
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:33,731
temporary hit points.

1059
01:07:33,731 --> 01:07:36,378
MATT: Yeah. So you now have ten temporary hit
points on top of what you had.

1060
01:07:36,378 --> 01:07:40,575
TRAVIS: Beautiful. And I don't think I get another
hit. It's only criticals that I--

1061
01:07:40,575 --> 01:07:42,419
LAURA: Oh! Okay. Well, still.

1062
01:07:42,419 --> 01:07:43,723
TRAVIS: But still, yeah, yeah.

1063
01:07:43,723 --> 01:07:46,720
MATT: All right. So that ends your turn, Grog?

1064
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:47,882
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1065
01:07:47,882 --> 01:07:49,352
MATT: That's the end of the round.

1066
01:07:49,352 --> 01:07:51,649
LIAM: Do I have a go? Do I get to go?

1067
01:07:51,649 --> 01:07:53,505
MATT: That's right. You held to wait until
everybody else has a go.

1068
01:07:53,505 --> 01:07:55,933
LIAM: Question: can I call out, Vex! Catch!

1069
01:07:55,933 --> 01:07:56,939
LAURA: Huh?

1070
01:07:56,939 --> 01:08:00,089
LIAM: And softball-pitch Whisper up to her?

1071
01:08:00,089 --> 01:08:05,211
MATT: Okay. So you-- go ahead and roll an attack
roll.

1072
01:08:05,211 --> 01:08:07,631
LAURA: It just stabs me.

1073
01:08:07,631 --> 01:08:08,931
LIAM: Sure. 26.

1074
01:08:08,931 --> 01:08:15,661
MATT: 26. Okay. As the dagger whips up past you,
you look down and see the thrown dagger. Do you

1075
01:08:15,661 --> 01:08:17,412
want to try and catch it?

1076
01:08:17,412 --> 01:08:18,714
LAURA: Sure.

1077
01:08:18,714 --> 01:08:21,017
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a dexterity check.

1078
01:08:21,017 --> 01:08:22,175
LAURA: Okay.

1079
01:08:22,175 --> 01:08:23,500
LIAM: This should be pretty good.

1080
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:26,919
LAURA: Where's my thing?

1081
01:08:26,919 --> 01:08:31,256
LIAM: This does involve me. Can I use my Luck for
her to re-roll that?

1082
01:08:31,256 --> 01:08:32,259
LAURA: 21.

1083
01:08:32,259 --> 01:08:39,403
MATT: No, unfortunately. You reach out and catch
the blade and it cuts across your hand a little

1084
01:08:39,403 --> 01:08:43,305
bit. Which at that point, if you want to--

1085
01:08:43,305 --> 01:08:44,635
LIAM: Bamf!

1086
01:08:44,635 --> 01:08:49,084
MATT: As your turn to travel with it, it's the
damage that needs to happen, it's the impact. So

1087
01:08:49,084 --> 01:08:58,246
you do take four points of piercing damage, as you
try and catch it from the front of the blade in

1088
01:08:58,246 --> 01:09:02,483
your hand, and the speed at which it's thrown is--
you feel the impact--

1089
01:09:02,483 --> 01:09:04,419
LAURA: And then I brace the broom to catch him--

1090
01:09:04,419 --> 01:09:08,532
MATT: At which point, the blade, all of a sudden,
swirls with dark, shadow energy and your brother

1091
01:09:08,532 --> 01:09:09,851
appears at your side.

1092
01:09:09,851 --> 01:09:12,864
LIAM: And I would like to use my bonus action to
cast Lay on Hands and give her four hit points.

1093
01:09:12,864 --> 01:09:16,796
LAURA: Aww, buddy! (laughs) That's so great.

1094
01:09:16,796 --> 01:09:19,676
LIAM: That's it, just four. I get to choose how
many

1095
01:09:19,676 --> 01:09:23,612
LAURA: Thanks! I catch him on the broom and hand
him the--

1096
01:09:23,612 --> 01:09:27,974
LIAM: And I'll use my movement to scooch my
uncomfortable crotch onto this stick you ride all

1097
01:09:27,974 --> 01:09:30,117
over the place. (groans)

1098
01:09:30,117 --> 01:09:33,208
MATT: All righty. Your movement is now, on the
broom, reduced to 20 feet, with two people on it.

1099
01:09:33,208 --> 01:09:34,725
LIAM: Cool.

1100
01:09:34,725 --> 01:09:36,151
LAURA: What are you going to do?

1101
01:09:36,151 --> 01:09:42,645
MATT: At which point, you see the wyverns and the
riders start thrashing about. Some of them have

1102
01:09:42,645 --> 01:09:47,407
spears that're jamming out from the middle of the
net. You watch as this guy spins around and takes

1103
01:09:47,407 --> 01:09:51,909
out three out of the guards that all just collapse
to the ground. One takes a stinger to the face,

1104
01:09:51,909 --> 01:09:56,599
another one gets bitten and has its head broken in
the process, while a third one gets a spear to the

1105
01:09:56,599 --> 01:09:58,271
front of the chest.

1106
01:09:58,271 --> 01:09:59,636
MARISHA: This wyvern asshole did that?

1107
01:09:59,636 --> 01:10:03,255
MATT: Over here, yeah. He's hurt, but he's been
taking out a lot of the guards along the way. The

1108
01:10:03,255 --> 01:10:10,852
rest of these lizard guards do a full double dash
this way past that guard there, who's giving

1109
01:10:10,852 --> 01:10:18,525
chase. These guys all rush up to try and make
their way to the front door again. They can't

1110
01:10:18,525 --> 01:10:24,941
really do anything yet to the door, but they can
get there. At this point in time--

1111
01:10:24,941 --> 01:10:26,291
SAM: Oh boy.

1112
01:10:26,291 --> 01:10:30,490
MATT: Vex, Vax.

1113
01:10:30,490 --> 01:10:31,403
LAURA: Yeah.

1114
01:10:31,403 --> 01:10:39,072
MATT: From your vantage point, up at the top on
the broom, you hear this distant echoing horn

1115
01:10:39,072 --> 01:10:42,202
sound, this (low horn noise).

1116
01:10:42,202 --> 01:10:43,797
LAURA: Shit.

1117
01:10:43,797 --> 01:10:48,770
MATT: It's echoing through the valley. You glance
over your shoulder and you see a bead of burning

1118
01:10:48,770 --> 01:11:00,798
red light making its way in your direction. Wings
flapping. It's closer than you think, and as it

1119
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:03,193
comes closer and closer towards you--

1120
01:11:03,193 --> 01:11:07,218
LAURA: Thordak comes and kills us all, right?!

1121
01:11:07,218 --> 01:11:09,940
MARISHA: Yeah, this is-- Happy 2016!

1122
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:17,637
MATT: You feel the blood rush from your face as
your immediate instinct is, "Oh god. The Cinder

1123
01:11:17,637 --> 01:11:23,925
"King is here." While there are flames involved,
the size is not as immense as you would expect

1124
01:11:23,925 --> 01:11:31,967
from Thordak. Instead what you see is a large,
red, winged bird with flames trailing off the

1125
01:11:31,967 --> 01:11:38,333
edges of its wings flapping in your direction,
coming over the wall on the outside of the

1126
01:11:38,333 --> 01:11:47,817
fortress. On its back you see a humanoid, but much
larger than anyone of your size, armored with dark

1127
01:11:47,817 --> 01:11:55,733
black and grayish-silver-trimmed iron armor, a
giant maul in one hand, itself reddish flame-like

1128
01:11:55,733 --> 01:12:00,454
hair. This is a fire giant, similar to the ones
you encountered in the City of Brass, riding on

1129
01:12:00,454 --> 01:12:06,697
the back of this ember-roc-type creature. As it
comes cruising over the top, you hear it, holding

1130
01:12:06,697 --> 01:12:15,482
a horn in its other hand, start shouting out, "The
Cinder King calls for swift execution! I deliver

1131
01:12:15,482 --> 01:12:26,146
"his hate with absolute strength." And it swoops
into a dive toward the front side of the gate. At

1132
01:12:26,146 --> 01:12:30,730
a full speed at this point, it coasts right
beneath both of you, swinging the hammer in the

1133
01:12:30,730 --> 01:12:33,528
air. I need both of you guys to make dexterity
saving throws.

1134
01:12:33,528 --> 01:12:36,042
LIAM: Would evasion work for this?

1135
01:12:36,042 --> 01:12:40,726
MATT: No. Well, evasion is against any spell.

1136
01:12:40,726 --> 01:12:42,830
LIAM: Spell, that's what I thought, I just wanted
to check.

1137
01:12:42,830 --> 01:12:44,754
LAURA: Do we get advantage for anything?

1138
01:12:44,754 --> 01:12:47,727
MATT: Let me check quick. (laughs) You do not get
advantage for anything.

1139
01:12:47,727 --> 01:12:50,626
LAURA: (laughs) Why, though?

1140
01:12:50,626 --> 01:12:53,691
MATT: But I admire you checking for any given
possibility.

1141
01:12:53,691 --> 01:12:56,020
LAURA: 16 for me.

1142
01:12:56,020 --> 01:12:58,409
LIAM: I'm going to use my last Luck.

1143
01:12:58,409 --> 01:13:00,055
SAM: You have inspiration.

1144
01:13:00,055 --> 01:13:01,819
LIAM: Oh, I do, and I can add it to that save,
right?

1145
01:13:01,819 --> 01:13:02,893
SAM: Sure.

1146
01:13:02,893 --> 01:13:09,279
LIAM: Good. Oh, then I'm 29. I rolled 11 off of
that. Thanks for the limerick.

1147
01:13:09,279 --> 01:13:10,738
MATT: What'd you roll?

1148
01:13:10,738 --> 01:13:12,139
LAURA: 16.

1149
01:13:12,139 --> 01:13:16,652
MATT: 16? Okay. So you manage to lift up onto the
broom, almost doing a complete handstand to get

1150
01:13:16,652 --> 01:13:22,473
out of the way, however, the bottom of it catches
your sister in the side of her leg, causes the

1151
01:13:22,473 --> 01:13:30,324
broom to lurch, and begin to lose control of it.
You both manage to hold on to the broom.

1152
01:13:30,324 --> 01:13:31,755
LAURA: That's good.

1153
01:13:31,755 --> 01:13:38,485
MATT: But you, from the impact of the hammer, do
suffer 16 points of bludgeoning damage. As the

1154
01:13:38,485 --> 01:13:45,808
bird, now in a full dive, slams in a giant fiery
crash into the front two gates of the keep.

1155
01:13:45,808 --> 01:13:48,672
LIAM: How close was it to us? If it hit us?

1156
01:13:48,672 --> 01:13:50,815
MATT: It swooped right underneath you.

1157
01:13:50,815 --> 01:13:52,313
LIAM: Can I do an attack of opportunity?

1158
01:13:52,313 --> 01:13:53,967
MATT: No, because you were trying to get out of
the way.

1159
01:13:53,967 --> 01:13:55,136
LIAM: All right.

1160
01:13:55,136 --> 01:13:59,639
MATT: To do that, you would have been fully off
the broom and you would fall.

1161
01:13:59,639 --> 01:14:01,881
LIAM: Understand, understand.

1162
01:14:01,881 --> 01:14:07,231
MATT: As it (swoosh) into this full dive, slams
into the two front gates which explode into a

1163
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:17,018
cloud of dust, broken rock, masonry, and iron. You
watch as the dust settles briefly. Now the giant

1164
01:14:17,018 --> 01:14:22,822
is stepping off of the back of this giant flaming
bird and looks around, clutching its hammer in its hand.

1165
01:14:22,822 --> 01:14:24,494
LAURA: Fuck.

1166
01:14:24,494 --> 01:14:28,802
(yelling)

1167
01:14:28,802 --> 01:14:34,777
SAM: That's large! That's like from a different
set of action figures.

1168
01:14:34,777 --> 01:14:39,758
TRAVIS: I think the scale is wrong, Matt, I think
you accidentally put things that are bigger than

1169
01:14:39,758 --> 01:14:40,987
us on the map.

1170
01:14:40,987 --> 01:14:43,244
LAURA: This is like when I made my Barbies date my
G.I. Joes.

1171
01:14:43,244 --> 01:14:46,605
(laughter)

1172
01:14:46,605 --> 01:14:49,748
MARISHA: Why is G.I. Joe so much shorter than
Barbie? Damn it!

1173
01:14:49,748 --> 01:14:53,080
TALIESIN: Did the lizard man take damage, by the
way?

1174
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:57,026
MATT: Actually yeah, as the dust clears, the
lizard men that were at the gate were all

1175
01:14:57,026 --> 01:15:02,203
destroyed in the impact, crushed, their bones
broken, and you can see one arm twitching out of

1176
01:15:02,203 --> 01:15:07,650
the center of the rubble. The doors are currently
blown open and off the hinges, there.

1177
01:15:07,650 --> 01:15:08,811
LAURA: Fuck.

1178
01:15:08,811 --> 01:15:14,103
MATT: All righty, and then--

1179
01:15:14,103 --> 01:15:21,254
SAM: We need some sort of miracle here! What we
need is some sort of miracle!

1180
01:15:21,254 --> 01:15:35,624
MATT: Fresh off the airplane.

1181
01:15:35,624 --> 01:15:40,610
ASHLEY: Hello, everybody!

1182
01:15:40,610 --> 01:15:43,243
LIAM: Divine Intervention!

1183
01:15:43,243 --> 01:15:45,089
SAM: (singing) We need a hero!

1184
01:15:45,089 --> 01:15:47,575
MATT: That is awesome.

1185
01:15:47,575 --> 01:15:52,430
ASHLEY: I've lost my voice a little bit, but you
know what? Fuck it! Der-n-der!

1186
01:15:52,430 --> 01:15:58,442
MATT: I want a shirt that says that. "Fuck it!
Der-n-der!"

1187
01:15:58,442 --> 01:16:01,049
TRAVIS: They'll get that in the store as soon as
possible.

1188
01:16:01,049 --> 01:16:08,505
MATT: Indeed. All righty, so, bringing us to the
top. As they both stand there, the flames still

1189
01:16:08,505 --> 01:16:13,687
emanating out from the impact, the lizardmen
scattered and broken at the gate, the battle still

1190
01:16:13,687 --> 01:16:21,247
waging on in the vicinity, you see as two other
battles over here, the wyvern rider on this wyvern

1191
01:16:21,247 --> 01:16:24,353
is stabbed in the head and is killed. The wyvern
is still around, but it takes another guard out

1192
01:16:24,353 --> 01:16:30,069
behind it. Over here, this guy continues to fight
and takes out two of the guards, but there is

1193
01:16:30,069 --> 01:16:36,990
still one behind that is holding strong. Top of
the round, Vex. What do you want to do, as you

1194
01:16:36,990 --> 01:16:39,991
just barely gather control over the broom again?

1195
01:16:39,991 --> 01:16:49,001
LAURA: Is that within range of you, to throw
something at it and bamf there, or--?

1196
01:16:49,001 --> 01:16:52,602
LIAM: Ish. We'll find out.

1197
01:16:52,602 --> 01:16:57,897
LAURA: I'm going to try to fly over. Am I able to
get to the roof above him?

1198
01:16:57,897 --> 01:17:01,162
MATT: Over here? Yeah, you can.

1199
01:17:01,162 --> 01:17:02,802
LARUA: Okay, I'll go there and land.

1200
01:17:02,802 --> 01:17:14,636
MATT: Okay. So you both make your way over,
landing on the roof. There you can see Xanthas is

1201
01:17:14,636 --> 01:17:21,493
still bound by the vines, his eyes wide. He's
like, "What are you doing? Release me!"

1202
01:17:21,493 --> 01:17:30,677
LAURA: I'm going to ignore him and Hunter's Mark
the giant, and then try to hit him from above.

1203
01:17:30,677 --> 01:17:35,228
MATT: Okay, so, getting right up to the edge,
arrow off to the side, go for it.

1204
01:17:35,228 --> 01:17:40,229
LAURA: 21 on the first one.

1205
01:17:40,229 --> 01:17:42,907
MATT: 21 on the first one? Hits.

1206
01:17:42,907 --> 01:17:47,183
LAURA: Yes! And that's Hunter's Mark and sneak
attack, right?

1207
01:17:47,183 --> 01:17:56,583
MATT: Technically, he went past you, saw you,
impacted you with him-- or she did, sorry-- It is

1208
01:17:56,583 --> 01:18:01,437
well aware where you went and knows that you--
There's no sneak attack. I'm sorry.

1209
01:18:01,437 --> 01:18:04,579
LAURA: Damn it! Fine, fine.

1210
01:18:04,579 --> 01:18:07,345
MATT: You'd have to hide somewhere to try and get
sneak attack.

1211
01:18:07,345 --> 01:18:08,923
LARUA: Oh, and that's a bonus action, right?

1212
01:18:08,923 --> 01:18:11,674
MATT: Correct. Which you used to move your
Hunter's Mark.

1213
01:18:11,674 --> 01:18:14,041
LAURA: Which I did, yeah, so don't worry about
it.

1214
01:18:14,041 --> 01:18:19,936
MATT: Vax, you're up on deck.

1215
01:18:19,936 --> 01:18:26,959
LAURA: 18 plus four lightning damage.

1216
01:18:26,959 --> 01:18:29,075
MATT: 18 plus four, nice.

1217
01:18:29,075 --> 01:18:31,507
LAURA: Oh, and then again! I attack him again!

1218
01:18:31,507 --> 01:18:33,245
MATT: Go for it! One arrow--

1219
01:18:33,245 --> 01:18:38,275
LAURA: And it definitely hits him! It's, like,
30-something.

1220
01:18:38,275 --> 01:18:40,119
MATT: Sure, that hits! Go for it.

1221
01:18:40,119 --> 01:18:53,629
LAURA: Argh. 17 plus four lightning damage!

1222
01:18:53,629 --> 01:19:04,799
MATT: All righty. Both arrows (impact). One slams
into the armor and sticks into it about three or

1223
01:19:04,799 --> 01:19:09,134
four inches, and you can see the giant female fire
giant glances at her shoulder angrily and looks up

1224
01:19:09,134 --> 01:19:10,797
over the top, at you.

1225
01:19:10,797 --> 01:19:13,511
LAURA: Oh, and I want to back up away. I want to
back away from the--

1226
01:19:13,511 --> 01:19:15,200
TRAVIS: I will woo her.

1227
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:17,067
LAURA: So she can't see me no more!

1228
01:19:17,067 --> 01:19:19,597
MATT: At the full movement it would've taken you
to get there, with your brother on your back,

1229
01:19:19,597 --> 01:19:20,993
that's as far as you can get.

1230
01:19:20,993 --> 01:19:25,942
LAURA: Can I crouch? Is that within my movement,
to crouch?

1231
01:19:25,942 --> 01:19:31,684
MATT: You're crouching, but you're not hiding. You
do have some cover because of the edge of the

1232
01:19:31,684 --> 01:19:38,810
wall. She sees you, but you have a little bit of
cover. Vax, you're up.

1233
01:19:38,810 --> 01:19:41,357
LIAM: Is the giant within 60 feet of me?

1234
01:19:41,357 --> 01:19:45,783
MATT: The giant may or may not be. You currently
have to get over to the edge to see it.

1235
01:19:45,783 --> 01:19:49,254
LIAM: All right, so I'm going to move up to the
edge. I'm going to use my bonus action to cast

1236
01:19:49,254 --> 01:19:50,707
Hunter's Mark.

1237
01:19:50,707 --> 01:19:54,818
SAM: You can't do that! That's not one of your
spells!

1238
01:19:54,818 --> 01:19:57,172
LAURA: We're twins, you guys!

1239
01:19:57,172 --> 01:19:58,960
TRAVIS: Oh my god, I'm going to barf.

1240
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,937
MATT: That's from being a vengeance paladin?

1241
01:20:00,937 --> 01:20:08,533
LIAM: Vengeance paladin, yes. Level up! And then
I'm going to throw Whisper at the back of her head

1242
01:20:08,533 --> 01:20:10,100
and hope that it hits.

1243
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:11,549
MATT: All right, go for it.

1244
01:20:11,549 --> 01:20:17,797
LIAM: Jeebus. Let's try that again. That is-- I'm
going to use--

1245
01:20:17,797 --> 01:20:19,694
LAURA: No, that's a good hit!

1246
01:20:19,694 --> 01:20:22,807
LIAM: Mm, yeah. 22.

1247
01:20:22,807 --> 01:20:24,190
MATT: 22 hits.

1248
01:20:24,190 --> 01:20:28,727
LIAM: All right. Okay. So-- and I'm going to bamf
there.

1249
01:20:28,727 --> 01:20:31,407
MATT: Okay. No sneak attack on this.

1250
01:20:31,407 --> 01:20:41,174
LIAM: No, I know. And the damage is 12 plus
psychic damage is eight! 20. And then I want to

1251
01:20:41,174 --> 01:20:43,123
use my movement, even though I can't disengage--

1252
01:20:43,123 --> 01:20:44,862
MATT: Did you roll your Hunter's Mark on that?

1253
01:20:44,862 --> 01:20:46,222
LIAM: Oh, no, I-- Thanks, Mattie!

1254
01:20:46,222 --> 01:20:48,005
MATT: You <i>just</i> used it!

1255
01:20:48,005 --> 01:20:49,510
LIAM: 21. Just one.

1256
01:20:49,510 --> 01:20:52,389
MARISHA: Now people are going to scream "Hunter's
Mark!" at <i>you</i> on the internet!

1257
01:20:52,389 --> 01:20:57,848
LIAM: I can't wait! I love you internet! I love
you so much! And then, even though I'm not using

1258
01:20:57,848 --> 01:21:01,252
disengage, I'm going to use my movement to back
the fuck up into that doorway.

1259
01:21:01,252 --> 01:21:09,048
MATT: Okay. As you back up into that doorway, she
swings around, the giant maul arcing in your

1260
01:21:09,048 --> 01:21:13,765
direction. A great maul, actually, specifically.
That is 24 to hit.

1261
01:21:13,765 --> 01:21:20,129
LIAM: I'll use Uncanny Dodge.

1262
01:21:20,129 --> 01:21:25,067
MATT: Okay, in order to take half damage? All
righty, so, that comes to-- oof. This is going to

1263
01:21:25,067 --> 01:21:27,251
be fun for you.

1264
01:21:27,251 --> 01:21:29,076
LIAM: So much fun.

1265
01:21:29,076 --> 01:21:35,979
MATT: All righty, let's get the dice out for this.
Oh, I have the wrong dice. There we go.

1266
01:21:35,979 --> 01:21:42,146
LIAM: Guys, I have 105 hit points. I am swole.

1267
01:21:42,146 --> 01:21:48,095
MARISHA: Welcome to triple digits!
Congratulations, you joined the rest of us!

1268
01:21:48,095 --> 01:21:56,264
MATT: You take 31 bludgeoning damage, halved to
15. It-- whack!-- slams you into the shoulder. You

1269
01:21:56,264 --> 01:22:00,357
dodge out of the way and the momentum actually
hits you and the inertia shoves you into the side

1270
01:22:00,357 --> 01:22:02,724
of the doorway. You catch yourself.

1271
01:22:02,724 --> 01:22:05,070
LIAM: Thank you! (grunting)

1272
01:22:05,070 --> 01:22:08,282
MATT: All right, that ends your turn? Keyleth,
you're up.

1273
01:22:08,282 --> 01:22:15,568
MARISHA: Okay, I am going to Tidal Wave these
motherfuckers. Yeah! Still have that packed from

1274
01:22:15,568 --> 01:22:22,234
the Fire Plane, what's up! So I don't have a-- do
we have a laser pointer in the house?

1275
01:22:22,234 --> 01:22:24,606
TALIESIN: It's not in your bag?

1276
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:30,578
MARISHA: You know, it's funny. We bought, like,
ten laser pointers, forever ago.

1277
01:22:30,578 --> 01:22:36,657
SAM: You know, it's fine. Matt will just point at
random until he finds the spot that you're looking for.

1278
01:22:36,657 --> 01:22:38,971
TALIESIN: Warmer, warmer, colder, colder, warmer.

1279
01:22:38,971 --> 01:22:40,469
MARISHA: I had a laser pointer.

1280
01:22:40,469 --> 01:22:42,129
LIAM: Here's one, here's one.

1281
01:22:42,129 --> 01:22:43,737
MARISHA: Hey, I think this is mine!

1282
01:22:43,737 --> 01:22:45,099
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure it is!

1283
01:22:45,099 --> 01:22:46,165
LIAM: Use it!

1284
01:22:46,165 --> 01:22:47,925
SAM: Tidal Wave!

1285
01:22:47,925 --> 01:22:53,708
MARISHA: Yeah, 30 feet long, ten foot wide, ten
foot tall. Everything must make a dexterity save.

1286
01:22:53,708 --> 01:22:54,953
MATT: So you're trying to do it this way?

1287
01:22:54,953 --> 01:22:57,029
MARISHA: That's exactly what I'm doing.

1288
01:22:57,029 --> 01:23:00,668
MATT: All right, so it comes bursting through. All
right, they both need to make a dexterity saving

1289
01:23:00,668 --> 01:23:02,579
throw against a DC 19, correct?

1290
01:23:02,579 --> 01:23:04,947
LAURA: 19, yes, right?

1291
01:23:04,947 --> 01:23:06,403
MARISHA: Yep!

1292
01:23:06,403 --> 01:23:15,404
MATT: That is a 17 for the giant, no. And that is
a seven for the roc. So no, they both take 4d8

1293
01:23:15,404 --> 01:23:17,355
bludgeoning damage.

1294
01:23:17,355 --> 01:23:26,509
MARISHA: And they are knocked prone, and if they
are flamey, then all unprotected flames are

1295
01:23:26,509 --> 01:23:27,696
distinguished.

1296
01:23:27,696 --> 01:23:29,293
SAM: Extinguished.

1297
01:23:29,293 --> 01:23:31,350
MATT: It is the creature's nature--

1298
01:23:31,350 --> 01:23:34,532
TALIESIN: They're very distinguished. They have
little fun mustaches.

1299
01:23:34,532 --> 01:23:36,062
MARISHA: They're dapper!

1300
01:23:36,062 --> 01:23:40,557
MATT: They both fall prone, but the nature of
their flames is natural. It is part of their

1301
01:23:40,557 --> 01:23:43,112
actual physicality, so the flames do not get
extinguished.

1302
01:23:43,112 --> 01:23:45,528
MARISHA: So they don't take extra water damage? So
4d8?

1303
01:23:45,528 --> 01:23:50,723
MATT: No, but the water does slam into the bird.
You see steam rise up as it impacts. The flames

1304
01:23:50,723 --> 01:23:54,762
darken a little bit and subside briefly. Both of
them are knocked off their feet into the ground as

1305
01:23:54,762 --> 01:23:59,539
you watch the tidal wave curl up, slam into both
of them, and then spill out and spread across the

1306
01:23:59,539 --> 01:24:01,881
ground, putting out this fire here, actually.

1307
01:24:01,881 --> 01:24:08,301
MARISHA: So 21 damage, and they're knocked prone.
21 damage.

1308
01:24:08,301 --> 01:24:11,726
MATT: Yep, great. That finishes your turn,
Keyleth, or do you want to move?

1309
01:24:11,726 --> 01:24:16,803
MARISHA: I'll stay where I am, actually.

1310
01:24:16,803 --> 01:24:22,901
MATT: Okay. That brings us to the general, as she
stands.

1311
01:24:22,901 --> 01:24:25,802
LAURA: Oh god, she's a general!

1312
01:24:25,802 --> 01:24:36,413
MATT: At half of her movement there. She,
extremely angry, gets up. (growls) "Oh, that's not

1313
01:24:36,413 --> 01:24:37,969
"playing fair!"

1314
01:24:37,969 --> 01:24:40,782
MARISHA: You looked like you needed a bath!

1315
01:24:40,782 --> 01:24:44,844
MATT: Looks back at a piece of the rubble, grabs
it-- actually is going to use her Flaming Anger,

1316
01:24:44,844 --> 01:24:50,768
which is an ability she has. She gets extremely
furious and tenses up. You can see muscles bulging

1317
01:24:50,768 --> 01:24:56,699
in her forehead. She grabs a big chunk of the
nearby rubble. You watch as the rubble,

1318
01:24:56,699 --> 01:25:02,805
already on fire from the impact, the fiery impact
of the site, begins to heat up. Lobs it at you.

1319
01:25:02,805 --> 01:25:04,270
MARISHA: Oh!

1320
01:25:04,270 --> 01:25:11,764
MATT: That is a natural one. As it goes whoosh,
and tumbles past--

1321
01:25:11,764 --> 01:25:13,455
MARISHA: Can I watch it, be like--

1322
01:25:13,455 --> 01:25:17,807
MATT: Yeah, it goes off and actually impacts one
of the wyverns flying through the sky and hits it.

1323
01:25:17,807 --> 01:25:20,781
It goes down over the outer wall.

1324
01:25:20,781 --> 01:25:23,465
LIAM: Echoing from in the gate, you hear, woo!

1325
01:25:23,465 --> 01:25:25,245
MARISHA: You've got a good arm!

1326
01:25:25,245 --> 01:25:29,566
MATT: Using her Flaming Anger, however, she
angrily grabs another piece, this one even larger.

1327
01:25:29,566 --> 01:25:37,126
Both hands over the head, the great maul hanging
at her side, and throws it at you. This time, that

1328
01:25:37,126 --> 01:25:39,782
is a 19 to hit.

1329
01:25:39,782 --> 01:25:42,114
MARISHA: Heh, uh, yeah. That hits.

1330
01:25:42,114 --> 01:25:59,227
MATT: Okay. You suffer 33 points of bludgeoning
damage from the impact, plus ten points of fire

1331
01:25:59,227 --> 01:26:03,714
damage from the heat, as it slams into you, almost
knocking you onto your back. You manage to catch

1332
01:26:03,714 --> 01:26:08,417
yourself, but the pieces of it hit you and then
break apart and fall to the ground around you. You

1333
01:26:08,417 --> 01:26:14,163
find your whole front side charred from the
impact. With the rest of her movement, is going

1334
01:26:14,163 --> 01:26:20,739
to-- let's see, she only has 20 feet. One, two,
three, four, in your direction, picking her great

1335
01:26:20,739 --> 01:26:30,037
maul up with her hand and swinging it. Thank you,
boyfriend glasses delivery. Ends the general's

1336
01:26:30,037 --> 01:26:31,729
turn. Percy, you're up.

1337
01:26:31,729 --> 01:26:33,018
TALIESIN: Okay!

1338
01:26:33,018 --> 01:26:34,517
MATT: Scanlan, you're on deck.

1339
01:26:34,517 --> 01:26:35,877
MARISHA: She throws rocks!

1340
01:26:35,877 --> 01:26:42,705
TALIESIN: Okay, now that this is happening, I've
decided-- I'm already committed to this wyvern and

1341
01:26:42,705 --> 01:26:47,379
rider over in the corner that have not ceased to
be a problem. I assume that they have not ceased

1342
01:26:47,379 --> 01:26:48,817
to be a problem at this point.

1343
01:26:48,817 --> 01:26:51,026
MATT: They're not currently harrying you, no.
They're fighting off guards.

1344
01:26:51,026 --> 01:26:53,262
TALIESIN: But they're going to become a problem if
they kill those guards.

1345
01:26:53,262 --> 01:26:54,468
MATT: Possibly. If they kill the guards.

1346
01:26:54,468 --> 01:27:01,059
TALIESIN: Okay, that'll do! So I'm going to take
three shots at that wyvern. I'm going to start

1347
01:27:01,059 --> 01:27:07,802
shooting at the wyvern. So, first attack. He's
held down by a net?

1348
01:27:07,802 --> 01:27:12,506
MATT: He is, but two of the guys who were holding
the net have died off, so it's almost negligible

1349
01:27:12,506 --> 01:27:15,823
at this point. He can't get the wings going, but
if the net is removed or he manages to get the net

1350
01:27:15,823 --> 01:27:17,359
off, it'll be fine.

1351
01:27:17,359 --> 01:27:25,299
TALIESIN: All right, I'll take a sharpshooter shot
at him. So, that's-- oh, for the fuck's sake.

1352
01:27:25,299 --> 01:27:29,066
That's a gun jam.

1353
01:27:29,066 --> 01:27:30,486
LAURA: Oh no!

1354
01:27:30,486 --> 01:27:32,132
TALIESIN: Yep, that's another one.

1355
01:27:32,132 --> 01:27:33,487
SAM: How many guns you got?

1356
01:27:33,487 --> 01:27:38,016
TALIESIN: I've got a lot, but I keep-- Ugh, god,
that hurt. Okay. That really hurt. Took ten points

1357
01:27:38,016 --> 01:27:44,959
of psychic damage, because that's funny. I'm
irritated. I'm putting that away and I'm pulling

1358
01:27:44,959 --> 01:27:49,494
out Bad News and taking a shot with Bad News at
him because I've got just enough of a round to do

1359
01:27:49,494 --> 01:27:57,397
that. Another sharpshooter shot, because I'm
irritated. Come on. Oh, for fuck's sake.

1360
01:27:57,397 --> 01:27:59,688
LAURA: Oh no!

1361
01:27:59,688 --> 01:28:01,387
TRAVIS: Did you die?

1362
01:28:01,387 --> 01:28:04,624
TALIESIN: Yeah, I died. I'm dead.

1363
01:28:04,624 --> 01:28:07,492
MATT: In a terrible round for Percy, as you walk
forward in the center, you turn to the side, fire

1364
01:28:07,492 --> 01:28:16,005
at the wyvern, get one shot that immediately locks
up. You feel the reeling feedback, psychic

1365
01:28:16,005 --> 01:28:22,054
feedback from Animus, course through you. You put
it away, pull out Bad News, take aim. As you fire,

1366
01:28:22,054 --> 01:28:28,288
that horrible silent click sound as you pull back.
You hold it away from you, just in time, as the

1367
01:28:28,288 --> 01:28:34,672
flame backs up in the butt end of the weapon just
flares outward. You can see, this is going to need

1368
01:28:34,672 --> 01:28:35,976
a little work to get it working again.

1369
01:28:35,976 --> 01:28:44,970
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, but this is getting stupid. You
know, it's almost worth-- It really does suck.

1370
01:28:44,970 --> 01:28:46,386
That legit sucks.

1371
01:28:46,386 --> 01:28:51,011
MATT: You want to move, or anything else you want to do
on your turn?

1372
01:28:51,011 --> 01:28:59,363
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, no, I am. I'm paying a deadly
price for this shit right now. I'm going to run

1373
01:28:59,363 --> 01:29:10,295
toward the-- that's some sort of bastille weapon
over there? Is there a-- No, to your-- yeah, right there.

1374
01:29:10,295 --> 01:29:13,710
MATT: Right there? That is a crate and a chest.

1375
01:29:13,710 --> 01:29:16,370
TALIESIN: What's the thing in the circle?

1376
01:29:16,370 --> 01:29:19,519
MATT: Oh, this right here, you mean? Oh, that is
one of the trebuchets that you had repaired and

1377
01:29:19,519 --> 01:29:21,009
one of the ones that isn't damaged yet.

1378
01:29:21,009 --> 01:29:22,268
TALIESIN: I'm running toward it.

1379
01:29:22,268 --> 01:29:25,549
SAM: Oh yeah, use the battlefield!

1380
01:29:25,549 --> 01:29:27,745
MARISHA: Press 'x' to use!

1381
01:29:27,745 --> 01:29:33,710
MATT: There you go. It is loaded. It has not been
used. It looks like the men that were currently

1382
01:29:33,710 --> 01:29:38,226
fighting the wyvern across the way had loaded it
up and then were assaulted when they threw the net

1383
01:29:38,226 --> 01:29:41,592
over. So it currently is ready for use.

1384
01:29:41,592 --> 01:29:42,938
TALIESIN: Okay!

1385
01:29:42,938 --> 01:29:44,256
MARISHA: Hot.

1386
01:29:44,256 --> 01:29:49,540
MATT: It is a difficult thing to aim. That ends
Percy's turn. Scanlan, you're up.

1387
01:29:49,540 --> 01:29:56,406
SAM: I'm going to move over to the right, towards
Grog, a bit. Just to get away from everybody else.

1388
01:29:56,406 --> 01:30:01,883
And I will-- We need to hit this giant, right?

1389
01:30:01,883 --> 01:30:03,334
LAURA: Yeah! Kill it!

1390
01:30:03,334 --> 01:30:08,836
SAM: So I will (sings) Bigby's Hand! But I have
very few spell slots left, so it's going to have

1391
01:30:08,836 --> 01:30:10,605
to be at level seven.

1392
01:30:10,605 --> 01:30:13,400
MATT: Okay. 7th-level Bigby's Hand.

1393
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:16,899
SAM: I will punch him in his giant solar plexus.

1394
01:30:16,899 --> 01:30:17,902
MATT: The giant?

1395
01:30:17,902 --> 01:30:19,958
SAM: Her! Her giant solar plexus. It's a she.

1396
01:30:19,958 --> 01:30:21,456
MATT: Yes it is.

1397
01:30:21,456 --> 01:30:23,143
LIAM: It's ten feet above your head.

1398
01:30:23,143 --> 01:30:28,342
SAM: Okay. With my hand cone, if that helps.

1399
01:30:28,342 --> 01:30:29,798
LIAM: Fuck, that shirt.

1400
01:30:29,798 --> 01:30:31,217
MATT: With your hand cone.

1401
01:30:31,217 --> 01:30:33,615
LIAM: Hold the hand cone to the shirt.

1402
01:30:33,615 --> 01:30:36,083
LAURA: Just, like, right here.

1403
01:30:36,083 --> 01:30:38,944
(laughter)

1404
01:30:38,944 --> 01:30:44,874
MATT: All righty, so Bigby's Hand appears, goes
into a Clenched Fist. Go ahead and make a spell

1405
01:30:44,874 --> 01:30:46,117
attack.

1406
01:30:46,117 --> 01:30:49,644
SAM: Oh! Because it's a melee attack-- spell
attack?

1407
01:30:49,644 --> 01:30:51,450
MATT: Correct.

1408
01:30:51,450 --> 01:30:53,545
SAM: 21.

1409
01:30:53,545 --> 01:30:58,343
MATT: 21 hits! And so it's cast at seventh level.

1410
01:30:58,343 --> 01:31:00,337
SAM: Yes, it's 8d8.

1411
01:31:00,337 --> 01:31:01,511
LAURA: Whoa!

1412
01:31:01,511 --> 01:31:02,834
LIAM: So handsome!

1413
01:31:02,834 --> 01:31:05,364
SAM: Do you have any d8s over here?

1414
01:31:05,364 --> 01:31:07,163
TALIESIN: I do. There's another d8.

1415
01:31:07,163 --> 01:31:08,453
MARISHA: Here's some more.

1416
01:31:08,453 --> 01:31:12,389
SAM: Okay. Oh wow! That's all of them. That's
eight.

1417
01:31:12,389 --> 01:31:16,787
MARISHA: It feels better that way. Ooh! Those are
good rolls!

1418
01:31:16,787 --> 01:31:18,896
TALIESIN: Those are very nice-looking d8s.

1419
01:31:18,896 --> 01:31:25,499
MATT: Oh, Vax? I also need you to make a
constitution saving roll.

1420
01:31:25,499 --> 01:31:26,870
LIAM: Great.

1421
01:31:26,870 --> 01:31:27,998
SAM: 40.

1422
01:31:27,998 --> 01:31:29,736
MATT: 40! Ooh!

1423
01:31:29,736 --> 01:31:31,292
LIAM: For what?

1424
01:31:31,292 --> 01:31:34,577
MATT: You have a concentration check for your
Hunter's Mark?

1425
01:31:34,577 --> 01:31:39,463
LIAM: Oh, awesome! I love-- I know all about
spells! It's a one.

1426
01:31:39,463 --> 01:31:40,564
LAURA: Oh no!

1427
01:31:40,564 --> 01:31:42,262
LIAM: But I have Luck, so I'm going to roll again

1428
01:31:42,262 --> 01:31:43,535
MATT: Okay. Go ahead.

1429
01:31:43,535 --> 01:31:46,307
LIAM: I have Luck! It's within the rules, yeah.
Concentration, straight--

1430
01:31:46,307 --> 01:31:47,905
MATT: No-- constitution, yeah.

1431
01:31:47,905 --> 01:31:49,153
LIAM: Constitution, straight 16.

1432
01:31:49,153 --> 01:31:53,524
MATT: Okay, you maintain concentration, you're
fine. All right, so, as you conjure Bigby's Hand,

1433
01:31:53,524 --> 01:31:57,790
you see the purple energy trail off your fingers,
and as your bring your hand back into an uppercut

1434
01:31:57,790 --> 01:32:01,287
motion, you watch as the air in front of the
giant, and she begins stomping forward in the

1435
01:32:01,287 --> 01:32:07,366
direction of Keyleth and Pike, the energy forms
into this giant purple fist of smoke that just

1436
01:32:07,366 --> 01:32:14,057
sucker-punches her right in the gut. She looks
down, confused and angry, at this fist that turns

1437
01:32:14,057 --> 01:32:15,823
into a middle finger immediately.

1438
01:32:15,823 --> 01:32:17,405
(laughter)

1439
01:32:17,405 --> 01:32:18,659
ASHLEY: Yeah!

1440
01:32:18,659 --> 01:32:19,818
SAM: You know me well.

1441
01:32:19,818 --> 01:32:21,786
MATT: You've moved ten feet that way. You still
have--

1442
01:32:21,786 --> 01:32:24,501
SAM: Is anyone within range of my Healing Words?

1443
01:32:24,501 --> 01:32:29,007
MATT: You have, looks to be Pike, Keyleth and Grog
all within range.

1444
01:32:29,007 --> 01:32:30,612
SAM: Keyleth's hurt, right?

1445
01:32:30,612 --> 01:32:31,859
MARISHA: I am hurt.

1446
01:32:31,859 --> 01:32:36,644
SAM: Okay. I will give her some Healing Words.

1447
01:32:36,644 --> 01:32:38,139
MATT: Second level?

1448
01:32:38,139 --> 01:32:41,220
MARISHA: Heal me. With your words.

1449
01:32:41,220 --> 01:32:47,576
SAM: I will heal you with my words. So that's 2d4
plus six, right? Wow, awesome. Eight.

1450
01:32:47,576 --> 01:32:48,991
(laughter)

1451
01:32:48,991 --> 01:32:50,806
MARISHA: All right. I'll take it.

1452
01:32:50,806 --> 01:32:52,890
MATT: All righty.

1453
01:32:52,890 --> 01:32:55,185
MARISHA: Yeah, 71 hit points.

1454
01:32:55,185 --> 01:33:14,219
MATT: There you go. That ends Scanlan's turn. All
right, so. Vex, I need you to make a wisdom saving

1455
01:33:14,219 --> 01:33:15,723
throw, if you could?

1456
01:33:15,723 --> 01:33:21,755
LAURA: Oh, that asshole that I'm standing next to.
Fucking dick!

1457
01:33:21,755 --> 01:33:23,492
ASHLEY: Get him.

1458
01:33:23,492 --> 01:33:26,697
LAURA: That's a seven.

1459
01:33:26,697 --> 01:33:32,341
MATT: It's a seven. As you, looking off the side,
getting your arrows ready for a second round, you

1460
01:33:32,341 --> 01:33:36,511
can hear a couple of whispers off to your side. As
you glance over, you make eye contact with

1461
01:33:36,511 --> 01:33:42,324
Xanthas, who has managed to shrug off the bramble
vines around his body. As soon as he finishes

1462
01:33:42,324 --> 01:33:47,506
talking, he points a finger towards you. And
you're listening. You snap to attention.

1463
01:33:47,506 --> 01:33:49,190
SAM: Oh no.

1464
01:33:49,190 --> 01:33:54,908
MATT: And he goes, "Why don't you take a walk off
the edge of that tower right there?"

1465
01:33:54,908 --> 01:33:56,484
ASHLEY: No!

1466
01:33:56,484 --> 01:34:01,105
SAM: (whispers) Wait a second, you can't do that!

1467
01:34:01,105 --> 01:34:06,836
LAURA: But when I'm doing it, I'm also still
intelligent, right?

1468
01:34:06,836 --> 01:34:11,645
MATT: You're still intelligent, oh.

1469
01:34:11,645 --> 01:34:14,719
TRAVIS: Oh, and you look good doing it. You look
good walking right off that edge.

1470
01:34:14,719 --> 01:34:23,055
LAURA: I'm going to walk off of it. I look at him,
I walk off it. Can I pull out my broom as I walk

1471
01:34:23,055 --> 01:34:28,644
off the edge and land on the broom? Because I did
what he told me, technically?

1472
01:34:28,644 --> 01:34:30,575
MATT: Yeah, so he's a--

1473
01:34:30,575 --> 01:34:33,517
ASHLEY: But he didn't say to not use your broom.

1474
01:34:33,517 --> 01:34:37,548
MATT: Just double-checking to make sure I could
make him do this.

1475
01:34:37,548 --> 01:34:42,895
ALL: (singing) Off the catwalk.

1476
01:34:42,895 --> 01:34:45,741
SAM: I don't think you can command someone to hurt
themselves.

1477
01:34:45,741 --> 01:34:49,840
MATT: It doesn't say that you can't.

1478
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:52,120
SAM: Really?

1479
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:54,354
LAURA: Really?!

1480
01:34:54,354 --> 01:34:57,275
MATT: Each time it takes damage, it gets to retake
the saving throw.

1481
01:34:57,275 --> 01:35:03,248
TALIESIN: Once you complete his instructions, you
can do anything you want.

1482
01:35:03,248 --> 01:35:06,110
LAURA: No, that's what I mean. I'm going to walk
off the edge and pull out the broom.

1483
01:35:06,110 --> 01:35:07,576
MATT: Okay.

1484
01:35:07,576 --> 01:35:10,105
LAURA: And just fly.

1485
01:35:10,105 --> 01:35:18,130
MATT: Okay. Yeah. So you come up and you go off
the edge. And you have the broom there. All right.

1486
01:35:18,130 --> 01:35:23,494
And you're coasting there with your broom.

1487
01:35:23,494 --> 01:35:27,884
LAURA: And I give him a thumbs-up. Thanks, Boss!

1488
01:35:27,884 --> 01:35:38,324
MATT: And he darts down the stairs into the
building. And as he's rushing off, he's like, "All

1489
01:35:38,324 --> 01:35:40,237
"right. Shoot your friends!"

1490
01:35:40,237 --> 01:35:41,799
(laughter)

1491
01:35:41,799 --> 01:35:44,228
MATT: He shouts it over his shoulder as he goes.

1492
01:35:44,228 --> 01:35:46,311
(laughter)

1493
01:35:46,311 --> 01:35:48,301
LIAM: That was awesome.

1494
01:35:48,301 --> 01:35:52,384
MATT: So now it is Pike's turn.

1495
01:35:52,384 --> 01:36:01,796
ASHLEY: Okay. So, getting up to speed here. So
Percy's kind of low?

1496
01:36:01,796 --> 01:36:03,093
TRAVIS: Percy!

1497
01:36:03,093 --> 01:36:04,574
TALIESIN: Yes, I'm low.

1498
01:36:04,574 --> 01:36:07,794
ASHLEY: Okay. I have on my Sprinter's Boots.

1499
01:36:07,794 --> 01:36:09,388
MARISHA: You're next to me.

1500
01:36:09,388 --> 01:36:10,691
ASHLEY: I'm next to you?

1501
01:36:10,691 --> 01:36:13,664
LAURA: And Percy's over by the trebuchet in the
corner.

1502
01:36:13,664 --> 01:36:19,338
ASHLEY: Can I make it to the trebuchet in the
corner with my Sprinter's Boots or even without?

1503
01:36:19,338 --> 01:36:22,364
MATT: Not without, you couldn't. You could, but it
would take your whole turn.

1504
01:36:22,364 --> 01:36:24,002
ASHLEY: Okay, then I will use my Sprinter's
Boots.

1505
01:36:24,002 --> 01:36:25,492
MATT: All right.

1506
01:36:25,492 --> 01:36:27,750
LIAM: You sound like you're an actual gnome.

1507
01:36:27,750 --> 01:36:29,167
LAURA: Yeah, you really do.

1508
01:36:29,167 --> 01:36:30,361
MATT: You get over there at the trebuchet.

1509
01:36:30,361 --> 01:36:34,521
ASHLEY: Okay. So I'll cast Cure Wounds-- Percy?

1510
01:36:34,521 --> 01:36:39,273
LAURA: Taliesin, you guys are talking so loud.

1511
01:36:39,273 --> 01:36:43,885
SAM: Controversial spell use over here--
Controversial! It will be addressed on Talks

1512
01:36:43,885 --> 01:36:44,742
Machina!

1513
01:36:44,742 --> 01:36:48,255
TALIESIN: He's trying to argue that you'll be
taking damage and I'm trying to show him that he's wrong.

1514
01:36:48,255 --> 01:36:49,367
LAURA: Oh.

1515
01:36:49,367 --> 01:36:50,616
TALIESIN: Sorry.

1516
01:36:50,616 --> 01:36:51,654
LAURA: Thank you, Percy.

1517
01:36:51,654 --> 01:36:52,955
TALIESIN: You're welcome.

1518
01:36:52,955 --> 01:36:54,602
LAURA: Damn you, Scanlan.

1519
01:36:54,602 --> 01:36:55,743
SAM: If I were DM-ing--

1520
01:36:55,743 --> 01:36:57,782
LIAM: (air horn sounds)

1521
01:36:57,782 --> 01:36:58,865
(laughter)

1522
01:36:58,865 --> 01:36:59,944
LIAM: Is that okay?

1523
01:36:59,944 --> 01:37:00,835
MATT: I'll allow it.

1524
01:37:00,835 --> 01:37:02,319
LIAM: It was on them.

1525
01:37:02,319 --> 01:37:04,352
MATT: Pike?

1526
01:37:04,352 --> 01:37:09,949
ASHLEY: No, because now I can't do it to Scanlan.
Okay, so what are you at?

1527
01:37:09,949 --> 01:37:11,652
TALIESIN: I'm at 59.

1528
01:37:11,652 --> 01:37:16,081
ASHLEY: Okay. So let's do a 3rd-level Cure
Wounds.

1529
01:37:16,081 --> 01:37:17,335
TALIESIN: That'll do.

1530
01:37:17,335 --> 01:37:23,273
MATT: Okay. by the way, you used one earlier. So
you have one more 3rd-level spell slot after this.

1531
01:37:23,273 --> 01:37:25,483
LAURA: Matt did a 3rd-level spell.

1532
01:37:25,483 --> 01:37:27,693
MATT: Before you got here. Just so you know.

1533
01:37:27,693 --> 01:37:33,999
ASHLEY: Okay. Maybe I should do-- I'm going to do
a fourth level. Because we need you.

1534
01:37:33,999 --> 01:37:37,580
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm not very-- I'm not being very
useful at the moment, but yeah. I'll get back there.

1535
01:37:37,580 --> 01:37:41,277
ASHLEY: Well, you're at the trebuchet now. Okay.

1536
01:37:41,277 --> 01:37:43,984
MATT: Grog, you're on deck, by the way.

1537
01:37:43,984 --> 01:37:51,354
TRAVIS: Can I ask you a question while she's
waiting?

1538
01:37:51,354 --> 01:37:52,696
MATT: Sure.

1539
01:37:52,696 --> 01:37:56,460
TRAVIS: A prone enemy. Do you get advantage on
them? If they're prone?

1540
01:37:56,460 --> 01:37:58,708
MATT: If they are prone, with melee attacks in the
vicinity?

1541
01:37:58,708 --> 01:38:00,645
TRAVIS: That's a natural crit, right? No,
that's--

1542
01:38:00,645 --> 01:38:02,317
MATT: No, it has advantage if you're within five
feet of it.

1543
01:38:02,317 --> 01:38:03,890
TRAVIS: Got it.

1544
01:38:03,890 --> 01:38:19,072
ASHLEY: 23.

1545
01:38:19,072 --> 01:38:21,034
LAURA: 23, Percy!

1546
01:38:21,034 --> 01:38:22,586
TALIESIN: Yay! Thank you!

1547
01:38:22,586 --> 01:38:31,215
ASHLEY: And then-- shoot! I was going to do
something before I moved, but I forgot. So now,

1548
01:38:31,215 --> 01:38:42,281
for my bonus action, I'm going to create a
beautiful, divine sword, Spiritual Weapon, and put

1549
01:38:42,281 --> 01:38:45,950
it up to the belly of the giant.

1550
01:38:45,950 --> 01:38:47,937
SAM: Ooh, yeah!

1551
01:38:47,937 --> 01:38:51,871
MATT: All right. At what level are you casting
this?

1552
01:38:51,871 --> 01:38:53,528
LAURA: (whispers) Cast it really high.

1553
01:38:53,528 --> 01:38:56,456
MATT: You've already used your 3rd-level--
4th-level spell, so you have to use your

1554
01:38:56,456 --> 01:38:57,583
2nd-level.

1555
01:38:57,583 --> 01:39:01,737
ASHLEY: I have four 3rd-levels, so I think I
actually have an extra 3rd-level. Because of the

1556
01:39:01,737 --> 01:39:02,919
necklace.

1557
01:39:02,919 --> 01:39:05,682
MATT: Okay. You have an extra one, then. But do
keep in mind, you've already cast a 3rd-level

1558
01:39:05,682 --> 01:39:09,828
spell this round-- a 4th-level spell, so if you're
doing a bonus action, it can only be 2nd-level or

1559
01:39:09,828 --> 01:39:11,621
lower. So it would be at 2nd-level.

1560
01:39:11,621 --> 01:39:13,093
ASHLEY: All right.

1561
01:39:13,093 --> 01:39:16,804
SAM: Can you use four 3rd-level spells to be one
12th-level spell?

1562
01:39:16,804 --> 01:39:18,339
(laughter)

1563
01:39:18,339 --> 01:39:19,569
MATT: Sure. Why not?

1564
01:39:19,569 --> 01:39:21,389
(laughter)

1565
01:39:21,389 --> 01:39:25,847
MARISHA: Because I want to do a
Fire-transport-via-plants-ball.

1566
01:39:25,847 --> 01:39:27,853
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll just do it at second.

1567
01:39:27,853 --> 01:39:29,699
MATT: That would be messy.

1568
01:39:29,699 --> 01:39:31,568
ASHLEY: I'll just do it at second level, then.

1569
01:39:31,568 --> 01:39:36,085
MATT: Okay. All right, that ends your turn, Pike?
All right. Grog?

1570
01:39:36,085 --> 01:39:45,352
TRAVIS: I'll run up to the bird-fire creature. And
taking advantage of him being on the ground, I

1571
01:39:45,352 --> 01:39:53,141
would like to go into a frenzied rage! And I would
like to whale on this piece of shit.

1572
01:39:53,141 --> 01:39:54,388
MATT: Go for it.

1573
01:39:54,388 --> 01:39:55,705
TRAVIS: At advantage, right?

1574
01:39:55,705 --> 01:39:56,551
MATT: Yes.

1575
01:39:56,551 --> 01:39:58,257
TRAVIS: Not as a-- I don't have to declare
Reckless?

1576
01:39:58,257 --> 01:39:59,298
MATT: Correct.

1577
01:39:59,298 --> 01:40:07,979
TRAVIS: Great! I will do Great Weapon Master. That
and minus five is 22?

1578
01:40:07,979 --> 01:40:09,579
MATT: 22 hits.

1579
01:40:09,579 --> 01:40:15,831
TRAVIS: Nice! Second one is 14, 28 minus-- that is
23?

1580
01:40:15,831 --> 01:40:17,614
MATT: Hits.

1581
01:40:17,614 --> 01:40:24,499
TRAVIS: Six minus-- 21.

1582
01:40:24,499 --> 01:40:25,512
MATT: Hits.

1583
01:40:25,512 --> 01:40:26,680
TRAVIS: Nice!

1584
01:40:26,680 --> 01:40:27,999
MATT: All three hit.

1585
01:40:27,999 --> 01:40:29,195
TRAVIS: All three hit.

1586
01:40:29,195 --> 01:40:30,407
LIAM: Get him, Grog.

1587
01:40:30,407 --> 01:40:36,537
TRAVIS: 18. Necrotic, four points. Oh god! 21. 31
for the first one.

1588
01:40:36,537 --> 01:40:37,999
MATT: Nice.

1589
01:40:37,999 --> 01:40:42,443
TRAVIS: 33.

1590
01:40:42,443 --> 01:40:47,131
MATT: Okay.

1591
01:40:47,131 --> 01:40:54,523
TRAVIS: And the third one. 20, 30.

1592
01:40:54,523 --> 01:40:58,899
MATT: 30. All right, that's 64 points of damage in
one round against the creature.

1593
01:40:58,899 --> 01:41:00,088
LAURA: What?!

1594
01:41:00,088 --> 01:41:03,986
MATT: As you rush in and start whaling on it, you
almost don't notice the proximity of it. The heat

1595
01:41:03,986 --> 01:41:09,662
is so hot that you suffer ten points of fire
damage just being that close to it. Your skin

1596
01:41:09,662 --> 01:41:12,340
starts to burn and the edges of your beard begins
to singe and curl in.

1597
01:41:12,340 --> 01:41:18,747
TRAVIS: Hey, hey! That sucks! Ten points of
burning damage.

1598
01:41:18,747 --> 01:41:20,576
MATT: Correct.

1599
01:41:20,576 --> 01:41:23,331
TRAVIS: "Burning" damage.

1600
01:41:23,331 --> 01:41:25,517
MATT: All right. That ends your turn?

1601
01:41:25,517 --> 01:41:26,553
TRAVIS: It does.

1602
01:41:26,553 --> 01:41:29,292
MATT: All right. With that, it goes to the large
ember-roc's turn.

1603
01:41:29,292 --> 01:41:30,691
TRAVIS: (laughs) Hi!

1604
01:41:30,691 --> 01:41:32,475
(laughter)

1605
01:41:32,475 --> 01:41:44,042
MATT: All righty. It's going to go ahead and use
an action to attempt its Inferno.

1606
01:41:44,042 --> 01:41:45,289
TRAVIS: Its what?

1607
01:41:45,289 --> 01:41:49,774
MATT: Its Inferno. It begins to beat its wings
extremely heavily. And as it does, the heated air

1608
01:41:49,774 --> 01:41:55,507
and the flames begin to billow up from around it.
I need you to make a dexterity saving throw, Grog.

1609
01:41:55,507 --> 01:41:59,698
TRAVIS: Do I get advantage on these when I'm
raging? I do, because I have Danger Sense.

1610
01:41:59,698 --> 01:42:01,369
MATT: You do.

1611
01:42:01,369 --> 01:42:04,446
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

1612
01:42:04,446 --> 01:42:10,297
(cheering, air horn sounds)

1613
01:42:10,297 --> 01:42:14,937
MATT: All right. Oh, that's-- good thing, too,
that was six, six, five, four on the d4 roll. That

1614
01:42:14,937 --> 01:42:21,633
was nice. All right, so that is 21 points of fire
damage, reduced to half. So ten.

1615
01:42:21,633 --> 01:42:22,646
TRAVIS: Okay.

1616
01:42:22,646 --> 01:42:25,042
MATT: Ten points of fire damage, again. And you
are not blown back.

1617
01:42:25,042 --> 01:42:26,551
TRAVIS: How's the beard doing?

1618
01:42:26,551 --> 01:42:31,455
MATT: It's burning a little bit, you're starting
to smell the hair singeing, it's making you angry

1619
01:42:31,455 --> 01:42:33,191
even in your-- angrier

1620
01:42:33,191 --> 01:42:34,784
TRAVIS: Just like Hagrid's, with the dragon egg?

1621
01:42:34,784 --> 01:42:39,486
MATT: A little bit, yeah. You're like, oh god!
However, you do not get pushed back, and as it's

1622
01:42:39,486 --> 01:42:43,116
taking off with its wings, as part of the
maneuver, you do get an attack of opportunity at

1623
01:42:43,116 --> 01:42:44,814
it, if you want to take it.

1624
01:42:44,814 --> 01:42:46,415
ASHLEY: Get him.

1625
01:42:46,415 --> 01:42:52,398
TRAVIS: Reckless. 21.

1626
01:42:52,398 --> 01:42:55,353
MATT: 40. It doesn't get all way over to them, it
gets--

1627
01:42:55,353 --> 01:42:57,566
ASHLEY: Go away.

1628
01:42:57,566 --> 01:42:59,862
SAM: Go away.

1629
01:42:59,862 --> 01:43:01,874
TRAVIS: It's a 21.

1630
01:43:01,874 --> 01:43:08,086
MATT: 21 hits. Go ahead and roll damage. It swoops
in the air, as you smash your axe in the air

1631
01:43:08,086 --> 01:43:09,190
towards--

1632
01:43:09,190 --> 01:43:10,340
(crash offscreen)

1633
01:43:10,340 --> 01:43:11,791
Like that.

1634
01:43:11,791 --> 01:43:13,204
(laughter)

1635
01:43:13,204 --> 01:43:14,625
MATT: How much damage?

1636
01:43:14,625 --> 01:43:16,772
TRAVIS: 23 with one point of necrotic.

1637
01:43:16,772 --> 01:43:22,639
MATT: Nice. 23. And you smack it, it shrieks in
the impact, but its wings still (whoosh), it arcs

1638
01:43:22,639 --> 01:43:26,984
over and lands on the ground, right behind Pike
and Percy. You guys feel the impact.

1639
01:43:26,984 --> 01:43:28,898
TRAVIS: We were just starting to talk! Come on!

1640
01:43:28,898 --> 01:43:35,473
MATT: All right. Top of the round now. This fellow
over here, who's now been loading up the ballista,

1641
01:43:35,473 --> 01:43:37,892
is going to go ahead and fire it at the bird.

1642
01:43:37,892 --> 01:43:39,001
TALIESIN: Yeah!

1643
01:43:39,001 --> 01:43:40,335
SAM: It's our guy.

1644
01:43:40,335 --> 01:43:41,668
TRAVIS: It's a bird.

1645
01:43:41,668 --> 01:43:42,988
MATT: That actually hits.

1646
01:43:42,988 --> 01:43:44,569
(cheering)

1647
01:43:44,569 --> 01:43:45,686
TRAVIS: Percy!

1648
01:43:45,686 --> 01:43:50,295
MATT: That is 12 points of piercing damage.

1649
01:43:50,295 --> 01:43:52,255
LAURA: Good job, Percy! Good job!

1650
01:43:52,255 --> 01:43:54,347
TALIESIN: I had a whole crew of people. I've got
people.

1651
01:43:54,347 --> 01:43:55,837
MARISHA: I got friends.

1652
01:43:55,837 --> 01:44:01,158
MATT: All righty. And over here, during this fray,
this guy manages to destroy the last guard,

1653
01:44:01,158 --> 01:44:04,216
dispatch him and get the rest of the net off.

1654
01:44:04,216 --> 01:44:06,306
LAURA: Oh no.

1655
01:44:06,306 --> 01:44:09,820
MATT: So that takes his full turn, but now that is
available over there.

1656
01:44:09,820 --> 01:44:11,731
MARISHA: He's available, yo!

1657
01:44:11,731 --> 01:44:16,720
MATT: These three guards, one of them dies but in
the process, they do manage to hack down the rest

1658
01:44:16,720 --> 01:44:18,839
of the wyverns, the wyvern does die.

1659
01:44:18,839 --> 01:44:20,093
LAURA: Yay.

1660
01:44:20,093 --> 01:44:27,370
MATT: This wyvern does dispatch the last guard,
however, and manages to take off its chain, which

1661
01:44:27,370 --> 01:44:30,381
is currently lodged into the back of the wyvern.
It pulls it forth from the wound with a spray of

1662
01:44:30,381 --> 01:44:34,338
blood, and now the wyvern is no longer bound. So
you now have two wyvern riders on the

1663
01:44:34,338 --> 01:44:35,338
battlefield.

1664
01:44:35,338 --> 01:44:37,628
TRAVIS: Oh, so much fun. Awesome.

1665
01:44:37,628 --> 01:44:41,184
MATT: Vex, it's your turn. You have to attack your
friends.

1666
01:44:41,184 --> 01:44:42,943
LAURA: I don't get to make a saving throw?

1667
01:44:42,943 --> 01:44:44,460
MATT: At the end of your turn, you do.

1668
01:44:44,460 --> 01:44:45,849
LAURA: Fuck!

1669
01:44:45,849 --> 01:44:52,430
MATT: Actually, Dominate Person, I don't think you
do! It's when you take damage. Let me see. Yeah.

1670
01:44:52,430 --> 01:44:58,871
LAURA: Maybe he has to tell me who to attack.

1671
01:44:58,871 --> 01:45:00,253
TALIESIN: It's take damage.

1672
01:45:00,253 --> 01:45:01,988
LAURA: It's when I take damage?

1673
01:45:01,988 --> 01:45:04,582
TALIESIN: You have to take damage, you have to
complete all of your actions.

1674
01:45:04,582 --> 01:45:07,040
LAURA: Oh, shit! I should have just fallen off the
fucking roof.

1675
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:08,674
MATT: That was your choice.

1676
01:45:08,674 --> 01:45:10,539
TALIESIN: You can't do that now, though.

1677
01:45:10,539 --> 01:45:13,846
MATT: Nope. You are on your broom, and you look
down, and the person who's closest to you of your

1678
01:45:13,846 --> 01:45:21,130
friends is Grog. And so you're like, "Well, I've
got to attack my friends." Make two shots against him.

1679
01:45:21,130 --> 01:45:23,169
LAURA: I'm sorry, Grog.

1680
01:45:23,169 --> 01:45:24,982
TRAVIS: I don't believe you.

1681
01:45:24,982 --> 01:45:26,390
LAURA: Oh! Natural one!

1682
01:45:26,390 --> 01:45:28,273
(laughter)

1683
01:45:28,273 --> 01:45:29,914
TRAVIS: It's true!

1684
01:45:29,914 --> 01:45:30,847
LAURA: And 20!

1685
01:45:30,847 --> 01:45:33,059
TRAVIS: Oh. That's a 20-- Oh. I thought you meant
natural.

1686
01:45:33,059 --> 01:45:34,197
LAURA: No, no, no.

1687
01:45:34,197 --> 01:45:38,787
MATT: 20 hits. So go ahead and roll damage against
Grog with one arrow. Grog, as you angrily finish

1688
01:45:38,787 --> 01:45:43,611
slashing as the ember-roc flies overhead, one
arrow hits the ground next to you. You're like,

1689
01:45:43,611 --> 01:45:48,834
"What the hell?" And then you feel the pain right
in the back of the neck as an arrow has embedded

1690
01:45:48,834 --> 01:45:52,097
itself about two inches into your meaty goliath
throat.

1691
01:45:52,097 --> 01:45:54,827
LAURA: 15 piercing damage.

1692
01:45:54,827 --> 01:45:56,874
TRAVIS: Halved to seven?

1693
01:45:56,874 --> 01:46:02,261
LAURA: I didn't even Hunter's Mark you, Grog! I'm
sorry!

1694
01:46:02,261 --> 01:46:05,501
MATT: Remember, you don't halve the lightning
damage it deals.

1695
01:46:05,501 --> 01:46:06,932
LAURA: I don't?

1696
01:46:06,932 --> 01:46:11,024
MATT: No. Because the lightning damage is
different beyond the piercing. So how much is--?

1697
01:46:11,024 --> 01:46:12,573
LAURA: Oh. It was four lightning damage.

1698
01:46:12,573 --> 01:46:14,025
MATT: Okay.

1699
01:46:14,025 --> 01:46:15,788
TRAVIS: So, total four-- and then the other
half--?

1700
01:46:15,788 --> 01:46:18,459
LAURA: It was 11 piercing damage.

1701
01:46:18,459 --> 01:46:25,910
MATT: So you take five plus four, so you take nine
points of damage total from that shot. All right.

1702
01:46:25,910 --> 01:46:27,452
LAURA: Sorry.

1703
01:46:27,452 --> 01:46:29,575
TRAVIS: That's okay, I'll get you later.

1704
01:46:29,575 --> 01:46:31,619
MATT: You're going to stand there for a moment
and--

1705
01:46:31,619 --> 01:46:33,751
LAURA: That's it? That's all I do?

1706
01:46:33,751 --> 01:46:36,572
MATT: I mean, you can move around if you want to.
You've just got to attack your friends when it

1707
01:46:36,572 --> 01:46:37,927
comes to your action.

1708
01:46:37,927 --> 01:46:40,591
ASHLEY: How do we get-- we have to--

1709
01:46:40,591 --> 01:46:42,147
TRAVIS: Punch yourself in the face!

1710
01:46:42,147 --> 01:46:43,412
MARISHA: Yeah.

1711
01:46:43,412 --> 01:46:45,422
LAURA: I can't. I don't know to punch myself in
the face.

1712
01:46:45,422 --> 01:46:47,076
TRAVIS: I'm going to punch you in the face.

1713
01:46:47,076 --> 01:46:49,743
SAM: Vex is working with them! Kill her.

1714
01:46:49,743 --> 01:46:51,585
(laughter)

1715
01:46:51,585 --> 01:46:53,366
SAM: I knew this day would come.

1716
01:46:53,366 --> 01:46:56,693
LAURA: I'm not aware of what I'm doing. I just
think, "I need to kill my friends."

1717
01:46:56,693 --> 01:46:58,533
MATT: Yeah, it's an impulse. It's like, "Okay, no
worries."

1718
01:46:58,533 --> 01:47:03,351
LAURA: Okay. I'm just going to be up here!
Shooting you guys!

1719
01:47:03,351 --> 01:47:07,922
MATT: Okay. That ends Vex's turn. Vax?

1720
01:47:07,922 --> 01:47:12,628
LIAM: If I go four down diagonally towards the
giant, I'll be within ten feet, yeah?

1721
01:47:12,628 --> 01:47:13,950
MATT: This way?

1722
01:47:13,950 --> 01:47:15,082
LIAM: Yeah.

1723
01:47:15,082 --> 01:47:19,479
MATT: Three, four, five. You can get within ten
feet, or you can get right up to it if you want to.

1724
01:47:19,479 --> 01:47:21,170
LIAM: I don't want to.

1725
01:47:21,170 --> 01:47:22,761
MATT: Okay, so you can get within ten feet of
her.

1726
01:47:22,761 --> 01:47:26,402
LIAM: Yeah. I am going to use bonus action to cast
Vow of Enmity against her.

1727
01:47:26,402 --> 01:47:27,726
MATT: Okay.

1728
01:47:27,726 --> 01:47:28,960
MARISHA: That sounds awesome.

1729
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:32,693
LIAM: With the feathers bristling in my armor. And
then I'm going to use the rest of my movement to

1730
01:47:32,693 --> 01:47:36,345
back straight back towards the wall, another two
or three squares, I think.

1731
01:47:36,345 --> 01:47:38,025
ASHLEY: Dang it, you're so cool!

1732
01:47:38,025 --> 01:47:43,692
LIAM: And I'm going to chuck-- well, we're good.
We've got Bigby's Hand right in her private area.

1733
01:47:43,692 --> 01:47:46,689
But I'm now going to throw Whisper at her back.

1734
01:47:46,689 --> 01:47:47,963
MATT: Okay.

1735
01:47:47,963 --> 01:47:50,976
LIAM: And I should have advantage because she's
busy.

1736
01:47:50,976 --> 01:47:53,044
MATT: Well, advantage because she's busy--

1737
01:47:53,044 --> 01:47:54,496
LAURA: And your vow.

1738
01:47:54,496 --> 01:47:56,682
LIAM: Well, and the vow. Either way. It doesn't
stack.

1739
01:47:56,682 --> 01:47:58,893
MATT: No, you have advantage on attack rolls
against the creature for one minute.

1740
01:47:58,893 --> 01:48:00,071
LIAM: Right.

1741
01:48:00,071 --> 01:48:01,204
MATT: Yeah.

1742
01:48:01,204 --> 01:48:02,654
LIAM: That or Bigby's.

1743
01:48:02,654 --> 01:48:04,199
MATT: Well, Bigby's isn't threatening,
technically. So it's--

1744
01:48:04,199 --> 01:48:05,754
LIAM: So 26 to hit.

1745
01:48:05,754 --> 01:48:07,061
MATT: That hits.

1746
01:48:07,061 --> 01:48:16,306
LIAM: So four. That's the dice before I add
anything. And then-- Does psychic damage get

1747
01:48:16,306 --> 01:48:19,041
damage? It's a die. I don't know, I haven't done
it.

1748
01:48:19,041 --> 01:48:20,427
LAURA: Doubled? You double all your dice.

1749
01:48:20,427 --> 01:48:21,690
LIAM: All your dice.

1750
01:48:21,690 --> 01:48:22,698
MATT: Yeah.

1751
01:48:22,698 --> 01:48:23,835
LIAM: Okay.

1752
01:48:23,835 --> 01:48:25,367
MATT: Was it a critical hit?

1753
01:48:25,367 --> 01:48:26,364
LIAM: No. Sorry.

1754
01:48:26,364 --> 01:48:27,715
MATT: Yeah, you don't double the dice.

1755
01:48:27,715 --> 01:48:38,333
LIAM: Ten, and then. Don't message me, internet.
Ten, 14, 19, 'cause I don't care, 22, 27, 33, 34,

1756
01:48:38,333 --> 01:48:48,863
37. Plus Hunter's Mark. 38, plus my plus eight to
the dagger is--

1757
01:48:48,863 --> 01:48:50,286
LAURA: Wow.

1758
01:48:50,286 --> 01:48:52,069
MATT: Rogues, man.

1759
01:48:52,069 --> 01:48:53,597
LIAM: 42.

1760
01:48:53,597 --> 01:48:55,362
MATT: 42. Nice.

1761
01:48:55,362 --> 01:48:56,996
LIAM: And that's it.

1762
01:48:56,996 --> 01:48:59,136
MATT: 42 points of impact. Are you staying back?

1763
01:48:59,136 --> 01:49:01,403
LIAM: I'm out of movement, aren't I?

1764
01:49:01,403 --> 01:49:02,833
MATT: I mean, you threw Whisper at it.

1765
01:49:02,833 --> 01:49:05,445
LIAM: But the bonus action was for the Vow of
Enmity, I believe.

1766
01:49:05,445 --> 01:49:07,650
MATT: Right. I'm saying, when you threw Whisper,
you weren't travelling with it.

1767
01:49:07,650 --> 01:49:08,759
LIAM: No, no, no.

1768
01:49:08,759 --> 01:49:10,685
MATT: Okay, good. Just making sure. That ends your
turn, Vax?

1769
01:49:10,685 --> 01:49:11,596
LIAM: Yeah.

1770
01:49:11,596 --> 01:49:12,888
MATT: Keyleth, you're up.

1771
01:49:12,888 --> 01:49:17,763
MARISHA: Okay. So we have a giant bird, and
another giant bird, and they're all really angry

1772
01:49:17,763 --> 01:49:19,209
at us, right?

1773
01:49:19,209 --> 01:49:21,261
MATT: It's one giant bird, and then angry
wyverns.

1774
01:49:21,261 --> 01:49:27,392
MARISHA: And then tiny, tiny dragons with wings.
Okay. Where's the wyvern?

1775
01:49:27,392 --> 01:49:30,936
MATT: That's a wyvern there, and there's a wyvern
over there.

1776
01:49:30,936 --> 01:49:35,227
LAURA: There's a wyvern, and there's a wyvern.

1777
01:49:35,227 --> 01:49:37,709
MARISHA: (singing) Kill the wyvern, kill the
wyvern!

1778
01:49:37,709 --> 01:49:39,817
ALL: (singing) Kill the wyvern!

1779
01:49:39,817 --> 01:49:42,718
TALIESIN: We're a little weird tonight.

1780
01:49:42,718 --> 01:49:47,216
MARISHA: That happened. Yeah, we kind of are,
aren't we?

1781
01:49:47,216 --> 01:49:48,777
TALIESIN: This is a musical episode.

1782
01:49:48,777 --> 01:49:50,383
MATT: I will fight you, Sam.

1783
01:49:50,383 --> 01:49:56,379
MARISHA: Man, I'm going to go ahead and cast Call
Lightning, I guess?

1784
01:49:56,379 --> 01:49:57,551
MATT: Okay!

1785
01:49:57,551 --> 01:50:03,281
MARISHA: And I'm going to bring it down on the
wyvern that's fucking shit up next to Percy.

1786
01:50:03,281 --> 01:50:09,764
MATT: All righty. So dexterity saving throw to
that wyvern right there?

1787
01:50:09,764 --> 01:50:11,766
MARISHA: Yup, that's the daddy.

1788
01:50:11,766 --> 01:50:15,380
MATT: That is a six! That is a very failed saving
throw. So that is--

1789
01:50:15,380 --> 01:50:16,828
MARISHA: 3d10.

1790
01:50:16,828 --> 01:50:18,245
MATT: Correct.

1791
01:50:18,245 --> 01:50:24,514
MARISHA: That's not a great roll. Ten points of
lightning damage.

1792
01:50:24,514 --> 01:50:29,368
MATT: Ten points of lightning damage to it. So, to
the wyvern, right?

1793
01:50:29,368 --> 01:50:30,719
MARISHA: To the wyvern.

1794
01:50:30,719 --> 01:50:35,162
MATT: Yeah. So the wyvern rider barely pulls out
of the way as the bolt of lightning from the

1795
01:50:35,162 --> 01:50:40,618
slowly conjured storm in the sky strikes out and
slams into the back of the wyvern. You see the

1796
01:50:40,618 --> 01:50:46,300
energy arcing through its body before it
dissipates, and the wyvern shakes from the impact,

1797
01:50:46,300 --> 01:50:51,275
looks around angrily. The rider pulls the reins
and gets it refocused.

1798
01:50:51,275 --> 01:50:58,023
MARISHA: Well, technically, doesn't Call
Lightning: every creature within five feet of that

1799
01:50:58,023 --> 01:51:00,092
point must make a dexterity saving throw?

1800
01:51:00,092 --> 01:51:02,960
MATT: It is every creature! Which the-- that's a
natural one.

1801
01:51:02,960 --> 01:51:06,029
MARISHA: So he also takes the ten points of
damage.

1802
01:51:06,029 --> 01:51:11,793
MATT: Yes. So, they both get hit. While he dodges,
the arcing energy actually travels through his

1803
01:51:11,793 --> 01:51:15,070
body, grounding himself to the creature. So they
both take damage.

1804
01:51:15,070 --> 01:51:28,146
MARISHA: And then I'm going to use my bonus action
to go-- let's go air elemental.

1805
01:51:28,146 --> 01:51:35,557
LAURA: Looked like she was smelling her armpit as
she did that.

1806
01:51:35,557 --> 01:51:37,454
MARISHA: (sniffs) Pit check is good!

1807
01:51:37,454 --> 01:51:40,324
(laughter)

1808
01:51:40,324 --> 01:51:41,553
TRAVIS: Kentucky.

1809
01:51:41,553 --> 01:51:42,693
MATT: Perfect.

1810
01:51:42,693 --> 01:51:44,006
(laughter)

1811
01:51:44,006 --> 01:51:49,349
MATT: All righty. You are now an air elemental.
You can move in your elemental form. You haven't

1812
01:51:49,349 --> 01:51:51,503
moved yet. So you can still move in your form if
you want.

1813
01:51:51,503 --> 01:51:56,223
MARISHA: Can I levitate a little? Get in the air a
little bit?

1814
01:51:56,223 --> 01:52:03,697
LAURA: It's fabulous in the air. It's really
good.

1815
01:52:03,697 --> 01:52:09,697
MATT: You're ever-so-slightly levitating.

1816
01:52:09,697 --> 01:52:11,207
MARISHA: Yeah.

1817
01:52:11,207 --> 01:52:12,595
MATT: All right, there you go, Keyleth.

1818
01:52:12,595 --> 01:52:13,736
MARISHA: Thanks, bruh.

1819
01:52:13,736 --> 01:52:18,437
MATT: All right, now it's General (inaudible)'s
turn.

1820
01:52:18,437 --> 01:52:20,901
TRAVIS: General what, did you say her name?

1821
01:52:20,901 --> 01:52:23,365
MATT: I didn't. You don't know it.

1822
01:52:23,365 --> 01:52:25,522
TRAVIS: Use your consonants, Mercer!

1823
01:52:25,522 --> 01:52:27,238
SAM: General Grievous.

1824
01:52:27,238 --> 01:52:29,592
MATT: I said too much. No. That would be so
hackneyed.

1825
01:52:29,592 --> 01:52:34,384
TALIESIN: General Chaos. General Calamity?

1826
01:52:34,384 --> 01:52:37,707
MATT: So, after taking the blow to the chest, is
going to go straight for you, Grog. You're a big

1827
01:52:37,707 --> 01:52:41,815
old target who came forward and slammed and has
dealt a crapton of damage.

1828
01:52:41,815 --> 01:52:43,645
TRAVIS: Be honest, she is attracted to me as
well.

1829
01:52:43,645 --> 01:52:48,632
MATT: Probably. As she turns with the floating
hand and the floating sword, waving it by the

1830
01:52:48,632 --> 01:52:54,784
hammer, watches as its ember-roc slams over
towards Percy and Pike. Feels pretty confident,

1831
01:52:54,784 --> 01:53:00,312
sees you, a little more of a heartier target.
Points the hammer at you and says, "You will be my

1832
01:53:00,312 --> 01:53:04,264
"charge tonight!" and starts walking to you.

1833
01:53:04,264 --> 01:53:05,793
LAURA: No, no, no.

1834
01:53:05,793 --> 01:53:09,252
ASHLEY: Get away from him. Get away from him!

1835
01:53:09,252 --> 01:53:14,449
MATT: See if it recharges. It does not recharge
Flaming Anger, unfortunately, but will take two

1836
01:53:14,449 --> 01:53:16,056
great maul attacks against you.

1837
01:53:16,056 --> 01:53:17,359
TRAVIS: Okay.

1838
01:53:17,359 --> 01:53:19,625
MARISHA: You're my charge. Yeah, boy.

1839
01:53:19,625 --> 01:53:22,518
MATT: That is a 21 to hit.

1840
01:53:22,518 --> 01:53:23,843
TRAVIS: It hits.

1841
01:53:23,843 --> 01:53:25,260
MATT: And a 23 to hit.

1842
01:53:25,260 --> 01:53:26,327
TRAVIS: That hits, too.

1843
01:53:26,327 --> 01:53:40,949
MATT: All righty. So you take, for the first hit,
40 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to half

1844
01:53:40,949 --> 01:53:42,404
to 20.

1845
01:53:42,404 --> 01:53:43,344
TRAVIS: Okay.

1846
01:53:43,344 --> 01:53:46,404
MATT: And the second strike, not as good a roll.

1847
01:53:46,404 --> 01:53:49,299
TRAVIS: Blinks with frustration.

1848
01:53:49,299 --> 01:53:55,529
MATT: I know. 29 points of bludgeoning damage,
reduced to--

1849
01:53:55,529 --> 01:53:56,985
TRAVIS: 14?

1850
01:53:56,985 --> 01:54:03,286
MATT: 14. So brings the hammer back, right into
your shoulder, and it sends you off your feet. You

1851
01:54:03,286 --> 01:54:07,274
catch yourself from the impact of the blow as the
hammer spins around and catches you in the other

1852
01:54:07,274 --> 01:54:12,124
side, right at the solar plexus, almost knocking
the wind out of you. You feel your feet skid into

1853
01:54:12,124 --> 01:54:17,405
the dry sand and dirt beneath your feet, and a
little smile curls in the corner of your face.

1854
01:54:17,405 --> 01:54:22,202
TRAVIS: Ooh, Miss Piggy! That tickled. Can I use
Retaliation to give her what's good for?

1855
01:54:22,202 --> 01:54:23,921
MATT: You've already used your reaction this
round.

1856
01:54:23,921 --> 01:54:25,590
TRAVIS: Oh, you're right! I did! Damn it!

1857
01:54:25,590 --> 01:54:26,615
MATT: Sorry.

1858
01:54:26,615 --> 01:54:28,416
TRAVIS: Good call.

1859
01:54:28,416 --> 01:54:35,843
MATT: But next turn I'm sure you'll be able to
give her what for. Percival, it's your turn. As

1860
01:54:35,843 --> 01:54:40,232
you're standing there, the presence, the heat of
this creature near you, you immediately suffer

1861
01:54:40,232 --> 01:54:46,198
four points of fire damage just from being in
the proximity of this entity.

1862
01:54:46,198 --> 01:54:53,686
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm cool. I'm going to try and--
Okay, out of curiosity, is that little trebuchet

1863
01:54:53,686 --> 01:54:56,000
there, is that more-or-less pointed at the wyvern
right now?

1864
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:02,048
MATT: More or less, you'd probably have to rotate
it a little bit. There is a large crank that has

1865
01:55:02,048 --> 01:55:05,473
to be rotated to shift its direction.

1866
01:55:05,473 --> 01:55:11,558
TALIESIN: I'm going to-- is it possible that I can
get this shot off in one round?

1867
01:55:11,558 --> 01:55:17,566
MATT: It is possible, if you make a strength check
to get it to move to its place right now.

1868
01:55:17,566 --> 01:55:27,834
TALIESIN: It's not like I've got a lot of options
here. Like, everything's going pretty iffy as it is.

1869
01:55:27,834 --> 01:55:31,589
MATT: So you're ignoring the bird for now and
you're going for the trebuchet against the

1870
01:55:31,589 --> 01:55:32,793
wyvern?

1871
01:55:32,793 --> 01:55:36,137
TALIESIN: There's honestly not a lot I can do
about the bird right now.

1872
01:55:36,137 --> 01:55:37,454
MATT: Okay.

1873
01:55:37,454 --> 01:55:41,123
TALIESIN: If I try to run from the bird, is it
within striking distance of me?

1874
01:55:41,123 --> 01:55:42,311
MATT: You don't know.

1875
01:55:42,311 --> 01:55:48,726
TALIESIN: Okay. Well, hardly matters. All right.
Let's-- 'It Hardly Matters' is the name of the

1876
01:55:48,726 --> 01:55:53,795
game. I'm going to see if I can get this-- I guess
I'm going to make a strength check to try and--

1877
01:55:53,795 --> 01:55:55,334
MATT: Okay. Go for it.

1878
01:55:55,334 --> 01:55:57,832
TALIESIN: Standard strength check?

1879
01:55:57,832 --> 01:55:59,306
ASHLEY: Come on.

1880
01:55:59,306 --> 01:56:00,835
LAURA: You can do it, Percy!

1881
01:56:00,835 --> 01:56:02,337
MARISHA: The adrenaline kicks in! Oh!

1882
01:56:02,337 --> 01:56:05,147
TALIESIN: Wait, wait, wait. I'm burning my
Resolve.

1883
01:56:05,147 --> 01:56:07,881
MATT: That's saving throws.

1884
01:56:07,881 --> 01:56:10,280
TALIESIN: Is it just saving throws? It's not--?

1885
01:56:10,280 --> 01:56:12,938
MATT: It's only for saving throws, not for ability
checks.

1886
01:56:12,938 --> 01:56:16,221
TALIESIN: Oh! Okay, so I'm not burning that, then.
Then that does not do anything.

1887
01:56:16,221 --> 01:56:17,081
MATT: What did you roll?

1888
01:56:17,081 --> 01:56:19,069
TALIESIN: I rolled a two. So I got a three.

1889
01:56:19,069 --> 01:56:23,845
MATT: Yeah. You go and grab the ratchet and it's
stuck. It begins to shift a little bit. You're not

1890
01:56:23,845 --> 01:56:26,677
sure if it's going to line up.

1891
01:56:26,677 --> 01:56:30,566
TALIESIN: Then I'm going to jump over that thing
and run into the tent, 'cause I'm goddamn useless

1892
01:56:30,566 --> 01:56:32,876
right now.

1893
01:56:32,876 --> 01:56:35,352
MATT: Okay. You leap over and make your way inside
the tent.

1894
01:56:35,352 --> 01:56:37,930
TALIESIN: Now I'm going to burn an Action Surge.

1895
01:56:37,930 --> 01:56:43,406
MATT: As you rush away, the creature reaches out
with one of its claws and rakes towards your back.

1896
01:56:43,568 --> 01:56:44,845
LIAM: He's keeping you humble tonight.

1897
01:56:44,845 --> 01:56:47,426
MATT: It's going to be a 20 to hit.

1898
01:56:47,426 --> 01:56:48,805
TALIESIN: That hits.

1899
01:56:48,805 --> 01:56:54,922
MATT: Okay. The claw streaks across your back. You
feel the pain and the sudden rush of adrenaline

1900
01:56:54,922 --> 01:57:04,065
hit you at the impact. That's going to be 14
points of slashing damage to your back.

1901
01:57:04,065 --> 01:57:07,636
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm 64.

1902
01:57:07,636 --> 01:57:09,898
ASHLEY: 64. Okay.

1903
01:57:09,898 --> 01:57:13,311
MARISHA: Question.

1904
01:57:13,311 --> 01:57:14,198
MATT: Yes?

1905
01:57:14,198 --> 01:57:17,126
MARISHA: Are we inside the fort walls?

1906
01:57:17,126 --> 01:57:19,972
MATT: You're inside the outer walls. This is the
actual front of the fort itself.

1907
01:57:19,972 --> 01:57:23,487
MARISHA: We're inside the outer walls. So the ones
that were trying to go through that door were

1908
01:57:23,487 --> 01:57:25,063
trying to get through the inner walls?

1909
01:57:25,063 --> 01:57:28,450
MATT: Into the actual fortress itself. Yes.

1910
01:57:28,450 --> 01:57:30,872
MARISHA: Okay. So we've gotten through one layer
of wall?

1911
01:57:30,872 --> 01:57:31,529
MATT: Correct.

1912
01:57:31,529 --> 01:57:33,363
MARISHA: And we're trying to get through the other
layer?

1913
01:57:33,363 --> 01:57:35,037
LAURA: Well, they're trying to get through the
wall.

1914
01:57:35,037 --> 01:57:37,024
MARISHA: Everyone seems to be. Just clarifying.
Continue.

1915
01:57:37,024 --> 01:57:39,015
MATT: Yes. Percy. You said you're taking your
Action Surge?

1916
01:57:39,015 --> 01:57:44,217
TALIESIN: I'm going to burn a bonus for a heal, so
I'm going to--

1917
01:57:44,217 --> 01:57:45,635
MATT: Second Wind?

1918
01:57:45,635 --> 01:57:53,827
TALIESIN: I'm going to burn a Second Wind, my only
Second Wind, and take 16 points back. And then I'm

1919
01:57:53,827 --> 01:57:57,282
going to burn my Action Surge to try and fix the
Pepperbox. The Animus box.

1920
01:57:57,282 --> 01:57:58,854
MATT: Okay.

1921
01:57:58,854 --> 01:58:09,502
TALIESIN: Thankfully the difficulty is not
horrible. Okay. And that's fine! Again. So the

1922
01:58:09,502 --> 01:58:11,197
Animus is back in action--

1923
01:58:11,197 --> 01:58:16,606
MATT: Okay, as you duck inside, clear your mind
for a second, focus, pull out your tools with your

1924
01:58:16,606 --> 01:58:20,592
Action Surge and quickly find the one section of
the barrel that had somehow sprung off and was

1925
01:58:20,592 --> 01:58:25,842
loose. You click it back into place, look up, it
spins. Functional, clear and fine.

1926
01:58:25,842 --> 01:58:28,340
LIAM: Did he blow on it like an NES cartridge?

1927
01:58:28,340 --> 01:58:29,290
MATT and TALIESIN: Yeah!

1928
01:58:29,290 --> 01:58:31,394
(laughter)

1929
01:58:31,394 --> 01:58:37,454
TALIESIN: Boy! That took a lot. But I'm now hiding
in that tent. I'm definitely hiding in that as far

1930
01:58:37,454 --> 01:58:39,345
back into that tent as I could have got.

1931
01:58:39,345 --> 01:58:40,946
MATT: That ends your turn.

1932
01:58:40,946 --> 01:58:43,012
(laughter)

1933
01:58:43,012 --> 01:58:45,002
ASHLEY: Right at the door. Just in case.

1934
01:58:45,002 --> 01:58:47,786
MARISHA: It's made of polyester. It's real bad.

1935
01:58:47,786 --> 01:58:50,923
MATT: All right, that brings us to Scanlan. You're
up.

1936
01:58:50,923 --> 01:58:57,238
SAM: I take a few steps towards Grog, if I can.
Over to my left a little bit, just so I could get

1937
01:58:57,238 --> 01:59:05,929
a clear shot-- Sorry, other left. So I get a clear
shot on the fire giant. With Bigby's Hand, I'm

1938
01:59:05,929 --> 01:59:11,250
going to do the Sugar Ray Leonard thing where it's
going round and round and round, but before he

1939
01:59:11,250 --> 01:59:14,421
punches, I'm going to fire a Lightning Bolt at
it.

1940
01:59:14,421 --> 01:59:20,816
MATT: Yes, not a problem. All right. That will--

1941
01:59:20,816 --> 01:59:22,844
LIAM: So in love!

1942
01:59:22,844 --> 01:59:28,819
MATT: It might singe a bit of the fur on the side
of your skivvies there, Grog, but a bolt of

1943
01:59:28,819 --> 01:59:30,613
lightning coasts right past you.

1944
01:59:30,613 --> 01:59:32,192
TRAVIS: Skivvies all right. Beard not so much.

1945
01:59:32,192 --> 01:59:37,656
MATT: Yeah. Fair enough. This is a dexterity
saving throw. That is a 17 dex save. That does not

1946
01:59:37,656 --> 01:59:40,301
make the DC, the giant gets full damage.

1947
01:59:40,301 --> 01:59:41,994
SAM: 8d6.

1948
01:59:41,994 --> 01:59:43,666
LAURA: Grog's poor ass.

1949
01:59:43,666 --> 01:59:45,895
(laughter)

1950
01:59:45,895 --> 01:59:47,779
LIAM: Grog, is that an extra mace over there?

1951
01:59:47,779 --> 01:59:49,220
MARISHA: Oh, god.

1952
01:59:49,220 --> 01:59:51,237
TRAVIS: Kashaw, somewhere, goes "Ah!"

1953
01:59:51,237 --> 01:59:52,946
MARISHA: Gets a nosebleed.

1954
01:59:52,946 --> 01:59:57,914
SAM: 24.

1955
01:59:57,914 --> 02:00:07,181
MATT: 24. Okay, so you release the bolt of
lightning, and then just as the lightning hits the

1956
02:00:07,181 --> 02:00:13,249
front of the giant's chest, as it was focusing on
Grog, it looks over and sees where the lightning

1957
02:00:13,249 --> 02:00:17,681
bolt came from just as the (whack) across the
chin. Go ahead and roll a--

1958
02:00:17,681 --> 02:00:23,205
SAM: So, the initial spell was level seven, but
subsequent actions--

1959
02:00:23,205 --> 02:00:24,931
MATT: It maintains the level you cast it.

1960
02:00:24,931 --> 02:00:28,114
SAM: Really? So it's another 8d8?

1961
02:00:28,114 --> 02:00:31,276
MATT: Yeah, well, you have to roll to hit to see
if you hit it first.

1962
02:00:31,276 --> 02:00:38,059
SAM: Okay. Oh yes, roll d20, right, this is a
spell attack. Whiffed.

1963
02:00:38,059 --> 02:00:39,842
MARISHA: What'd you get?

1964
02:00:39,842 --> 02:00:41,292
SAM: A natural one.

1965
02:00:41,292 --> 02:00:42,953
ALL: Oh no!

1966
02:00:42,953 --> 02:00:50,691
MATT: You watch as it swings towards the giant,
staring at you, at the last minute glances out and

1967
02:00:50,691 --> 02:00:57,064
she sees the fist and ducks back, slow-motion
passes past her chin. As the jaw clenches, the

1968
02:00:57,064 --> 02:01:01,522
teeth grinding underneath, you see the jagged
broken tops of the giant teeth as the eyes

1969
02:01:01,522 --> 02:01:03,323
(whoosh) right back to you.

1970
02:01:03,323 --> 02:01:07,573
SAM: Oh boy. That was less Sugar Ray Leonard and
more just, like, Sugar Ray.

1971
02:01:07,573 --> 02:01:11,994
(laughter)

1972
02:01:11,994 --> 02:01:14,195
MATT: I'm going to put Bigby's Hand on the other
side now for that.

1973
02:01:14,195 --> 02:01:16,251
SAM: (singing) Every morning when I wake up.

1974
02:01:16,251 --> 02:01:19,270
(laughter)

1975
02:01:19,270 --> 02:01:22,084
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

1976
02:01:22,084 --> 02:01:29,895
MATT: I almost want to give you inspiration for
that. Sure. Take back your bardic inspiration for

1977
02:01:29,895 --> 02:01:31,233
that, sure.

1978
02:01:31,233 --> 02:01:33,099
SAM: Oh! Great!

1979
02:01:33,099 --> 02:01:38,307
MATT: Scanlan, you want to stay where you are or
you going to move? You still have ten more feet of

1980
02:01:38,307 --> 02:01:39,716
movement if you want it.

1981
02:01:39,716 --> 02:01:43,537
SAM: I mean, she's coming for me, so I'll just
back up ten feet.

1982
02:01:43,537 --> 02:01:46,978
MATT: All right. There you go, all right.

1983
02:01:46,978 --> 02:01:48,573
TALIESIN: Run!

1984
02:01:48,573 --> 02:01:59,102
MATT: Now, darting from out from the side here,
Xanthas runs out, looks over the wall, sees you

1985
02:01:59,102 --> 02:02:01,681
floating above. "Keep attacking your friends!"

1986
02:02:01,681 --> 02:02:07,070
MARISHA: Fucking dick. Can we take him out? He was
always an asshole. Come on.

1987
02:02:07,070 --> 02:02:10,176
LAURA: Obviously he's a bad guy. Obviously he's a
bad guy now.

1988
02:02:10,176 --> 02:02:12,110
ASHLEY: Would you consider him a friend?

1989
02:02:12,110 --> 02:02:14,880
MARISHA: He was always annoyed by us.

1990
02:02:14,880 --> 02:02:17,495
LAURA: Oh yeah, do I like him so much now?

1991
02:02:17,495 --> 02:02:19,081
MATT: Oh he's great.

1992
02:02:19,081 --> 02:02:20,864
LAURA: He's my friend?

1993
02:02:20,864 --> 02:02:26,087
MATT: Well, I mean-- You are considered charmed by
him, so yes.

1994
02:02:26,087 --> 02:02:27,717
LAURA: He's my friend, cool.

1995
02:02:27,717 --> 02:02:34,539
MATT: Yep. Seems like an ally at this point.
Focusing on that, keeping you informed--

1996
02:02:34,539 --> 02:02:36,906
MARISHA: But Vex, he never had any redeeming
qualities.

1997
02:02:36,906 --> 02:02:39,609
LAURA: I love him, he's my best friend.

1998
02:02:39,609 --> 02:02:41,072
MARISHA: This is the first time we're hearing of
this!

1999
02:02:41,072 --> 02:02:42,782
LAURA: Xanthas is my best friend forever!

2000
02:02:42,782 --> 02:02:44,861
TALIESIN: You don't know him like she does.

2001
02:02:44,861 --> 02:02:47,878
MARISHA: (chuckle) They spent a lot of time
together.

2002
02:02:47,878 --> 02:02:57,732
MATT: Okay. Is going to look down and points his
finger across and a beam of reddish energy comes

2003
02:02:57,732 --> 02:03:03,626
coursing to the ground and explodes right there in
the center of this area, actually right in the

2004
02:03:03,626 --> 02:03:08,649
center with the fire elemental, so I need Grog,
Scanlan, and Keyleth to all make dexterity saving

2005
02:03:08,649 --> 02:03:10,147
throws.

2006
02:03:10,147 --> 02:03:11,204
TRAVIS: Cool!

2007
02:03:11,204 --> 02:03:12,699
ASHLEY: This guy's the worst.

2008
02:03:12,699 --> 02:03:14,245
TALIESIN: This is technically a magic--

2009
02:03:14,245 --> 02:03:15,798
MATT: This is a Fireball.

2010
02:03:15,798 --> 02:03:19,273
TRAVIS: (singing) Natural 20.

2011
02:03:19,273 --> 02:03:22,928
MARISHA: Ouch, jeez, I rolled a two.

2012
02:03:22,928 --> 02:03:25,029
SAM: Disadvantage on ability checks, not saves.

2013
02:03:25,029 --> 02:03:26,319
MATT: Correct.

2014
02:03:26,319 --> 02:03:27,464
SAM: 11.

2015
02:03:27,464 --> 02:03:28,850
MARISHA: Seven.

2016
02:03:28,850 --> 02:03:33,560
MATT: Okay, that's full damage to Keyleth and
Scanlan, half damage to Grog, as this is a

2017
02:03:33,560 --> 02:03:37,244
5th-level Fireball.

2018
02:03:37,244 --> 02:03:39,243
MARISHA: 5th-level Fireball?

2019
02:03:39,243 --> 02:03:40,429
MATT: Yeah.

2020
02:03:40,429 --> 02:03:41,882
MARISHA: Who did this?

2021
02:03:41,882 --> 02:03:45,367
MATT: Little punk over here that was on top and
went down inside and came out the other side.

2022
02:03:45,367 --> 02:03:47,002
MARISHA: Wait, is that Xanthas?

2023
02:03:47,002 --> 02:03:48,447
MATT: Xanthas, yeah.

2024
02:03:48,447 --> 02:03:51,147
TRAVIS: Does that break his--

2025
02:03:51,147 --> 02:03:54,395
MATT: It's not concentration, no.

2026
02:03:54,395 --> 02:03:57,116
TRAVIS: I know a lot about magic, you guys.

2027
02:03:57,116 --> 02:04:03,908
MATT: 33 points of fire damage to Scanlan, 33
points of damage to Keyleth in her elemental form,

2028
02:04:03,908 --> 02:04:05,648
and 15 points of fire damage to you, Grog.

2029
02:04:05,648 --> 02:04:06,997
TRAVIS: Yay.

2030
02:04:06,997 --> 02:04:12,242
MATT: And after firing, he ducks down to the side,
and he doesn't do much 'cause he still has partial

2031
02:04:12,242 --> 02:04:15,486
cover while he's behind the top of that wall right
now.

2032
02:04:15,486 --> 02:04:16,678
ASHLEY: He sucks!

2033
02:04:16,678 --> 02:04:18,660
MARISHA: What a doucher.

2034
02:04:18,660 --> 02:04:22,556
LAURA: I like him, you guys, I think he's great.

2035
02:04:22,556 --> 02:04:27,577
MATT: That ends his turn. Pike, you're up. At the
beginning of your turn, due to the proximity of

2036
02:04:27,577 --> 02:04:33,267
the heat of the bird behind you, the giant
ember-roc, you would take eight points of fire

2037
02:04:33,267 --> 02:04:37,674
damage, but it's reduced to four because of your
armor's fire resistance. So that's four points of

2038
02:04:37,674 --> 02:04:39,214
fire damage.

2039
02:04:39,214 --> 02:04:41,328
ASHLEY: So, I have a quick question.

2040
02:04:41,328 --> 02:04:42,469
MATT: Yes.

2041
02:04:42,469 --> 02:04:48,208
ASHLEY: So the thing that Percy was trying to do
with the trebuchet. Did it not work because it

2042
02:04:48,208 --> 02:04:49,241
wasn't--?

2043
02:04:49,241 --> 02:04:50,535
TALIESIN: Because I'm weak.

2044
02:04:50,535 --> 02:04:53,252
ASHLEY: You're weak, okay. I want to try and give
it a go.

2045
02:04:53,252 --> 02:04:58,057
MATT: Okay. By the way, your sword should have
attacked last round when you summoned it, so go

2046
02:04:58,057 --> 02:05:01,264
ahead and make a spell attack with it just because
I totally forgot about that.

2047
02:05:01,264 --> 02:05:04,391
ASHLEY: Ugh, what do I roll?

2048
02:05:04,391 --> 02:05:07,967
MATT: Just roll a d20 and add your spell attack
modifier. You're up next, Grog.

2049
02:05:07,967 --> 02:05:10,796
ASHLEY: Ooh, 28!

2050
02:05:10,796 --> 02:05:14,392
MATT: That hits! Go ahead and roll the damage for
your spiritual weapon.

2051
02:05:14,392 --> 02:05:15,797
ASHLEY: 2d6?

2052
02:05:15,797 --> 02:05:19,047
MATT: That is 1d8 plus five.

2053
02:05:19,047 --> 02:05:24,042
ASHLEY: Eight.

2054
02:05:24,042 --> 02:05:28,481
MATT: All right, so that's an additional eight
points of damage to the giant. Okay, so,

2055
02:05:28,481 --> 02:05:29,908
continuing your turn--

2056
02:05:29,908 --> 02:05:31,361
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'm going to try to--

2057
02:05:31,361 --> 02:05:35,425
MATT: Winch it? All right, so as you see Percy run
off, you reach up, go ahead and make a strength

2058
02:05:35,425 --> 02:05:36,402
check.

2059
02:05:36,402 --> 02:05:37,826
ASHLEY: Okay.

2060
02:05:37,826 --> 02:05:40,247
LAURA: You got it.

2061
02:05:40,247 --> 02:05:43,899
ASHLEY: 12.

2062
02:05:43,899 --> 02:05:45,311
MATT: 12? Okay, that's fine.

2063
02:05:45,311 --> 02:05:46,627
(cheering)

2064
02:05:46,627 --> 02:05:50,514
MATT: You grab it and (grunts) and it takes a
second, but you begin getting the winch to move

2065
02:05:50,514 --> 02:05:53,249
around. As it does, does it begins to rotate. How
far are you rotating it? Who are you aiming it

2066
02:05:53,249 --> 02:05:54,474
towards?

2067
02:05:54,474 --> 02:05:56,528
ASHLEY: I'm going to point it right at the fire
bird.

2068
02:05:56,528 --> 02:06:01,757
MATT: Okay. As you pull the winch around, and
there's a little trigger underneath as you get it

2069
02:06:01,757 --> 02:06:05,124
in place that's kind of holding it.

2070
02:06:05,124 --> 02:06:06,565
ASHLEY: (bink)

2071
02:06:06,565 --> 02:06:18,973
MATT: As Pike (bink), the trebuchet, the sudden
momentum of the direct inertia to momentum, the

2072
02:06:18,973 --> 02:06:29,026
device spins over top and lobs this large boulder
within this giant sling over and slamming right

2073
02:06:29,026 --> 02:06:38,390
towards the face of the ember-roc. That's an 18.
Go ahead and roll 4d12 damage.

2074
02:06:38,390 --> 02:06:42,444
SAM: Heavy duty. d12s!

2075
02:06:42,444 --> 02:06:47,118
MATT: It's a siege weapon, man.

2076
02:06:47,118 --> 02:06:49,902
LAURA: That's 4d12 right there.

2077
02:06:49,902 --> 02:06:51,557
MATT: It's meant to destroy walls.

2078
02:06:51,557 --> 02:06:53,369
SAM: Wow.

2079
02:06:53,369 --> 02:07:02,965
ASHLEY: 27!

2080
02:07:02,965 --> 02:07:08,554
MATT: 27 points of bludgeoning damage to the
ember-roc's face as it slams in, the rock breaks

2081
02:07:08,554 --> 02:07:14,513
across its skull. And its head rears back from the
impact and it stumbles back a bit, shaking its

2082
02:07:14,513 --> 02:07:20,598
head. You can see part of its beak is cracked now
from the impact. Blinking its eyes and shrieking.

2083
02:07:20,598 --> 02:07:23,307
MARISHA: Oh, Buddy.

2084
02:07:23,307 --> 02:07:26,743
MATT: No, it's trying to kill your friends.

2085
02:07:26,743 --> 02:07:28,937
ASHLEY: Wait, aren't we attacking him?

2086
02:07:28,937 --> 02:07:34,447
MATT: You can still move if you'd like, and you
have your bonus action to move your sword over if

2087
02:07:34,447 --> 02:07:35,577
you'd like.

2088
02:07:35,577 --> 02:07:40,362
ASHLEY: Okay, bonus action, is there only one
charge on that thing? Can I keep doing it, or no?

2089
02:07:40,362 --> 02:07:41,683
MATT: Every round, it lasts for a minute.

2090
02:07:41,683 --> 02:07:46,715
ASHLEY: Okay, I guess for my bonus action I'm
going to cast Shield of Faith on Percy.

2091
02:07:46,715 --> 02:07:50,377
MATT: Okay, for the Spiritual Weapon, just so you
know--

2092
02:07:50,377 --> 02:07:51,825
LAURA: I'll bet that's concentration.

2093
02:07:51,825 --> 02:07:56,013
MATT: Well no, it's not concentration. But you can
choose to use your bonus action to have the sword

2094
02:07:56,013 --> 02:07:58,522
attack, or cast a spell and the sword just does
nothing.

2095
02:07:58,522 --> 02:08:01,230
ASHLEY: I guess it's not going to help you. I'm
going to use the spiritual weapon.

2096
02:08:01,230 --> 02:08:04,052
MATT: Okay, so the bonus action is the sword
toward the giant, or the bird?

2097
02:08:04,052 --> 02:08:05,132
ASHLEY: Toward the giant.

2098
02:08:05,132 --> 02:08:09,457
MATT: The sword swings out of the way, arcs
through the air, roll another spell attack.

2099
02:08:09,457 --> 02:08:14,862
ASHLEY: 16.

2100
02:08:14,862 --> 02:08:16,417
MATT: 16 does not hit.

2101
02:08:16,417 --> 02:08:18,475
ASHLEY: I'm going to use Guided Strike to add
ten.

2102
02:08:18,475 --> 02:08:19,682
MATT: Okay!

2103
02:08:19,682 --> 02:08:22,230
ASHLEY: Oh but no, I don't want to, is it too late
to retract that?

2104
02:08:22,230 --> 02:08:24,008
MATT: If you want to.

2105
02:08:24,008 --> 02:08:25,884
ASHLEY: I wanted to use that for something bigger.

2106
02:08:25,884 --> 02:08:28,195
TRAVIS: Something bigger than the fire giant?

2107
02:08:28,195 --> 02:08:30,728
LAURA: Something bigger than the spiritual
weapon.

2108
02:08:30,728 --> 02:08:32,156
ASHLEY: It's not going to do that much damage.

2109
02:08:32,156 --> 02:08:33,681
TALIESIN: Yeah, something that does more damage
than the spiritual weapon.

2110
02:08:33,681 --> 02:08:37,365
MATT: Yeah, I mean you don't have to, it's up to
you.

2111
02:08:37,365 --> 02:08:39,543
ASHLEY: No, it's okay. I'll wait for something
bigger.

2112
02:08:39,543 --> 02:08:42,440
MATT: Okay so the blade arcs over and slams into
the armor of the giant and the giant kind of

2113
02:08:42,440 --> 02:08:48,500
shrugs it off. No damage. You just couldn't quite
impact against the creature's flesh. You still can

2114
02:08:48,500 --> 02:08:50,044
move if you want to.

2115
02:08:50,044 --> 02:08:52,332
ASHLEY: I'm going to stay.

2116
02:08:52,332 --> 02:08:53,730
MATT: You're going to stay there?

2117
02:08:53,730 --> 02:08:54,835
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2118
02:08:54,835 --> 02:08:58,297
MATT: Okay. The trebuchet is expended, by the way,
it would have to be loaded. And to load that

2119
02:08:58,297 --> 02:09:01,483
thing, it takes quite a few people. Just so you're
aware it's probably not going to be useful again

2120
02:09:01,483 --> 02:09:02,681
in this battle.

2121
02:09:02,681 --> 02:09:04,232
There are other weapons in the field.

2122
02:09:04,232 --> 02:09:06,203
LIAM: Everybody to the trebuchet.

2123
02:09:06,203 --> 02:09:08,691
MARISHA: All hands on deck!

2124
02:09:08,691 --> 02:09:13,547
MATT: Heave ho! All right, Pike, that ends your
turn?

2125
02:09:13,547 --> 02:09:19,369
ASHLEY: Well, I'll move out a little bit then, I
didn't know it would take so much. Towards the

2126
02:09:19,369 --> 02:09:20,612
giant.

2127
02:09:20,612 --> 02:09:22,056
MATT: Okay.

2128
02:09:22,056 --> 02:09:23,836
ASHLEY: I don't know why!

2129
02:09:23,836 --> 02:09:25,646
MATT: That's about as far as you can get there.

2130
02:09:25,646 --> 02:09:27,688
ASHLEY: All right!

2131
02:09:27,688 --> 02:09:30,733
MATT: Staying in melee range of the creature or do
you want to leave its melee range? It will get a

2132
02:09:30,733 --> 02:09:35,009
strike at you if you do. Actually, it will not
because it already stuck at Percy so you can go

2133
02:09:35,009 --> 02:09:38,545
there, you're fine. All right, that ends your
turn. Grog, you're up.

2134
02:09:38,545 --> 02:09:45,106
TRAVIS: I see the giant eyeing Scanlan and I'm
like: I thought you said I was your charge. You

2135
02:09:45,106 --> 02:09:51,515
are not cheating on me this early in our
relationship. And I take both of my attacks at

2136
02:09:51,515 --> 02:09:58,661
general hot fire giant's face. Reckless. Great
Weapon Master.

2137
02:09:58,661 --> 02:10:00,518
MATT: Go for it.

2138
02:10:00,518 --> 02:10:07,293
TRAVIS: 30 minus five is 25!

2139
02:10:07,293 --> 02:10:09,117
MATT: Hits.

2140
02:10:09,117 --> 02:10:14,552
TRAVIS: 26 minus five is 21?

2141
02:10:14,552 --> 02:10:15,719
MATT: Hits.

2142
02:10:15,719 --> 02:10:17,439
TRAVIS: Awesome!

2143
02:10:17,439 --> 02:10:36,215
34 for the first one, with six points of
necrotic. 41.

2144
02:10:36,215 --> 02:10:40,465
MATT: 41 points of damage on that one.

2145
02:10:40,465 --> 02:10:42,877
TRAVIS: I rolled a d12 plus 13.

2146
02:10:42,877 --> 02:10:46,501
MATT: Oh, a straight 12 on that one? Oh, that's
nasty. All right. You still have your bonus

2147
02:10:46,501 --> 02:10:47,565
action.

2148
02:10:47,565 --> 02:10:49,780
TRAVIS: I do! I would like to hit him again!

2149
02:10:49,780 --> 02:10:51,206
MATT: Okay.

2150
02:10:51,206 --> 02:10:57,546
TRAVIS: Not that great. 21.

2151
02:10:57,546 --> 02:10:59,528
MATT: That hits.

2152
02:10:59,528 --> 02:11:09,664
TRAVIS: 26, with five points of necrotic.

2153
02:11:09,664 --> 02:11:11,866
MATT: 26 points of damage.

2154
02:11:11,866 --> 02:11:13,475
ASHLEY: Jeez.

2155
02:11:13,475 --> 02:11:16,727
MARISHA: Let's take this bird down.

2156
02:11:16,727 --> 02:11:19,989
MATT: You did over 100 points of damage in one
round of combat.

2157
02:11:19,989 --> 02:11:21,825
ALL: What?!

2158
02:11:21,825 --> 02:11:25,669
ASHLEY: That's so much, Grog.

2159
02:11:25,833 --> 02:11:29,420
TRAVIS: Look, I am a one-fire-giant kind of guy. I
get very upset about these things.

2160
02:11:29,420 --> 02:11:32,881
MATT: So with Bigby's Hand floating on one side
and a glowing sword on the other, the giant

2161
02:11:32,881 --> 02:11:40,700
focusing on Scanlan, you get angry and just
release this torrent of strikes. Pulling back,

2162
02:11:40,700 --> 02:11:45,740
from the blade you can see dark blood begin to
pour from the plates and the giant is wounded, but

2163
02:11:45,740 --> 02:11:48,268
it's grinning. And its attention swings back to
you.

2164
02:11:48,268 --> 02:11:50,503
TRAVIS: I told you I was worth a date.

2165
02:11:50,503 --> 02:11:52,680
MATT: All right, that ends your turn, Grog?

2166
02:11:52,680 --> 02:11:54,099
TRAVIS: Yeah. That's it.

2167
02:11:54,099 --> 02:12:01,378
MATT: All right. The bird, who has watched Pike
run past, after being slammed in the face by the

2168
02:12:01,378 --> 02:12:07,124
trebuchet, angrily steps forward here. First let's
see if it regenerates that. It does recover its

2169
02:12:07,124 --> 02:12:15,782
inferno ability, however, it is going to unleash a
bite and two claw attacks on you. That is a

2170
02:12:15,782 --> 02:12:18,255
natural 20 on the bite.

2171
02:12:18,255 --> 02:12:19,964
TRAVIS: No, Pike!

2172
02:12:20,136 --> 02:12:21,920
MATT: That is a 19 to hit on the first claw
attack.

2173
02:12:21,920 --> 02:12:23,329
ASHLEY: No.

2174
02:12:23,329 --> 02:12:26,936
MATT: And that is a 23 to hit. So a bite and a
claw attack. The bite is a critical,

2175
02:12:26,936 --> 02:12:47,749
unfortunately. So as that one comes to strike you,
that is 19 plus 2d8 fire damage. So you take 30

2176
02:12:47,749 --> 02:12:49,590
points of slashing damage.

2177
02:12:49,590 --> 02:12:51,186
ASHLEY: Okay.

2178
02:12:51,186 --> 02:12:57,585
MATT: Plus ten points of fire damage reduced to
half, so five. Actually, it would have been 20, so

2179
02:12:57,585 --> 02:12:59,478
that's ten points of fire damage.

2180
02:12:59,478 --> 02:13:02,884
ASHLEY: I have resistance to fire.

2181
02:13:02,884 --> 02:13:06,330
MATT: Right, it would have been 20.

2182
02:13:06,330 --> 02:13:07,663
TRAVIS: Okay.

2183
02:13:07,663 --> 02:13:09,504
LAURA: But then, because he did a melee attack on
you.

2184
02:13:09,504 --> 02:13:14,200
ASHLEY: Yeah, he did a melee attack so the
attacker suffers 2d6.

2185
02:13:14,200 --> 02:13:17,429
MATT: Is that fire damage?

2186
02:13:17,429 --> 02:13:18,757
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2187
02:13:18,757 --> 02:13:20,890
MATT: You watch as there's a burst of flame but it
seems to have no affect on the creature.

2188
02:13:20,890 --> 02:13:22,198
ASHLEY: Okay.

2189
02:13:22,198 --> 02:13:26,503
MATT: This creature is fire by nature.

2190
02:13:26,503 --> 02:13:28,326
TRAVIS: Naughty by nature?

2191
02:13:28,326 --> 02:13:35,981
MATT: Possibly. All right, and it's going to begin
flanking around you.

2192
02:13:35,981 --> 02:13:38,004
LAURA: Damn it.

2193
02:13:38,004 --> 02:13:44,455
MATT: After it does its strikes it-- (stomps).
That brings us to the top of the round. Now, this

2194
02:13:44,455 --> 02:13:52,030
guy is going to spend his turn loading up and then
taking another shot at the bird there. That one

2195
02:13:52,030 --> 02:13:58,810
unfortunately goes wide. It fires and slams into
the ground and a big cloud of dust and rock gets

2196
02:13:58,810 --> 02:14:06,925
thrown into the air as the large bolt jettisons
into the floor, wasted shot there. This wyvern

2197
02:14:06,925 --> 02:14:11,081
over here is going to fly up.

2198
02:14:11,081 --> 02:14:12,832
LAURA: And attack me!

2199
02:14:12,832 --> 02:14:15,626
MATT: No, he's going to go after Keyleth, the air
elemental form there.

2200
02:14:15,626 --> 02:14:17,084
MARISHA: Bring it.

2201
02:14:17,084 --> 02:14:23,564
MATT: This wyvern here is going to rush over to
Scanlan. And these guys are going to rush in and

2202
02:14:23,564 --> 02:14:25,173
try and aid Scanlan against this.

2203
02:14:25,173 --> 02:14:27,474
MARISHA: Hoping to get hit. Hit me, come on, hit
me!

2204
02:14:27,474 --> 02:14:31,783
MATT: So we have the wyvern against you,
Keyleth.

2205
02:14:31,783 --> 02:14:34,276
MARISHA: Yeah.

2206
02:14:34,276 --> 02:14:36,309
MATT: Bite attack is a two! No, that is not going
to hit.

2207
02:14:36,309 --> 02:14:37,689
MARISHA: Negatory.

2208
02:14:37,689 --> 02:14:40,957
MATT: The stinger is going to be an 18 to hit.

2209
02:14:40,957 --> 02:14:41,815
MARISHA: Oh yeah.

2210
02:14:41,815 --> 02:14:47,171
MATT: So you take 11 points of piercing damage.
Are you immune to poison?

2211
02:14:47,171 --> 02:14:50,949
MARISHA: Huh? No, I'm immune to poison. Elemental.

2212
02:14:50,949 --> 02:14:54,126
MATT: That's what I figured. So you just take 11
points of piercing damage from that strike.

2213
02:14:54,126 --> 02:14:56,574
MARISHA: I'm good. I'm good.

2214
02:14:56,574 --> 02:15:00,546
MATT: The other wyvern is going to swing down. I
forgot, the wyvern rider is going to take an

2215
02:15:00,546 --> 02:15:01,925
attack at you.

2216
02:15:01,925 --> 02:15:03,073
SAM: Oh shit.

2217
02:15:03,073 --> 02:15:07,331
MATT: I forgot, he's on there too. He swings down
with his giant club. That's going to be a 21 to hit.

2218
02:15:07,331 --> 02:15:08,525
MARISHA: Yeah.

2219
02:15:08,525 --> 02:15:18,711
MATT: You suffer nine points of bludgeoning damage
from the wyvern rider. You Scanlan, the wyvern is

2220
02:15:18,711 --> 02:15:21,653
going to strike at you with both its bite and
its--

2221
02:15:21,653 --> 02:15:24,386
SAM: I would like to Cutting Words the first one.

2222
02:15:24,386 --> 02:15:29,528
MATT: Okay. You can decide whether or not to
Cutting Words, I'm just giving you this because

2223
02:15:29,528 --> 02:15:32,967
you've seen them fight. The bite is painful, the
stinger is where the poison is.

2224
02:15:32,967 --> 02:15:34,603
SAM: I'll save it for that one.

2225
02:15:34,603 --> 02:15:36,066
MATT: Save it for that one, if you're going to.

2226
02:15:36,066 --> 02:15:37,018
SAM: Sure.

2227
02:15:37,018 --> 02:15:38,558
MATT: But that was a 23 to hit.

2228
02:15:38,558 --> 02:15:39,707
SAM: That hits.

2229
02:15:39,707 --> 02:15:41,449
MATT: And the stinger is a 21.

2230
02:15:41,449 --> 02:15:45,046
SAM: Well, I Cutting Words that one.

2231
02:15:45,046 --> 02:15:46,502
MATT: Okay.

2232
02:15:46,502 --> 02:15:55,808
SAM: So I'll sing at it: (singing) I don't want to
die! Get your wings off me baby, get your wings

2233
02:15:55,808 --> 02:16:09,072
off me baby. I don't want to die. All around the
world! Only a seven.

2234
02:16:09,072 --> 02:16:12,679
MATT: 21 minus seven is 14.

2235
02:16:12,679 --> 02:16:14,233
SAM: That's my AC.

2236
02:16:14,233 --> 02:16:16,032
MATT: Ooh.

2237
02:16:16,032 --> 02:16:18,325
LIAM: You're being punished for using that song.

2238
02:16:18,325 --> 02:16:26,915
MATT: Yeah. So you take 11 points of piercing
damage for the bite. And you take 11 points of

2239
02:16:27,027 --> 02:16:29,953
piercing damage from the stinger, and I need you
to make a constitution saving throw.

2240
02:16:29,953 --> 02:16:32,845
SAM: No problem.

2241
02:16:32,845 --> 02:16:34,458
TALIESIN: High.

2242
02:16:34,458 --> 02:16:37,653
SAM: High. Constitution?

2243
02:16:37,653 --> 02:16:38,780
MATT: Yes.

2244
02:16:38,780 --> 02:16:40,071
SAM: 18.

2245
02:16:40,071 --> 02:16:45,027
MATT: 18? Okay. You manage to-- you take 12 points
of poison damage.

2246
02:16:45,027 --> 02:16:49,567
SAM: In addition to what you already said, 11 and
11? So 12 more.

2247
02:16:49,567 --> 02:16:54,575
MATT: Correct. And I need you to make constitution
saving throws for each of those for your

2248
02:16:54,575 --> 02:16:58,410
concentration. You have advantage on these.
Because of your Warcaster feat.

2249
02:16:58,410 --> 02:17:00,357
SAM: So wait, that's two concentration rolls?

2250
02:17:00,357 --> 02:17:02,735
MATT: Yeah, advantage on the-- you make two of
them, yeah.

2251
02:17:02,735 --> 02:17:08,003
SAM: 17 plus something.

2252
02:17:08,003 --> 02:17:09,974
MATT: Yeah, you're fine. Next one with advantage.

2253
02:17:09,974 --> 02:17:14,175
SAM: Natural 20. Two natural 20's!

2254
02:17:14,175 --> 02:17:21,259
MATT: All righty, and the wyvern rider is going to
take a swing at you.

2255
02:17:21,259 --> 02:17:22,523
SAM: Sure, sure.

2256
02:17:22,523 --> 02:17:23,774
MATT: That is a 22.

2257
02:17:23,774 --> 02:17:25,304
SAM: Yeah, it hits.

2258
02:17:25,304 --> 02:17:30,595
MATT: You take nine points of bludgeoning damage
as it smacks you over the head with a giant club.

2259
02:17:30,595 --> 02:17:31,727
ASHLEY: Are you okay!?

2260
02:17:31,727 --> 02:17:33,561
MATT: I need you to make another constitution
saving throw with advantage.

2261
02:17:33,561 --> 02:17:34,775
LAURA: Oh my god.

2262
02:17:34,775 --> 02:17:36,736
MATT: Because you're being hacked like crazy here.

2263
02:17:36,736 --> 02:17:38,465
SAM: Another natural 20.

2264
02:17:38,465 --> 02:17:39,764
ASHLEY: Shut the fuck up.

2265
02:17:39,764 --> 02:17:41,844
SAM: The other one was a three. Three and a 20.

2266
02:17:41,844 --> 02:17:49,392
MATT: There you go. Warcaster, man. Warcaster is a
great feat. All right, that ends their turn, it is

2267
02:17:49,392 --> 02:17:51,463
now Vex's turn.

2268
02:17:51,463 --> 02:17:53,852
LAURA: Yes, can I attack my best buddy?

2269
02:17:53,852 --> 02:17:55,895
LIAM: Who is that?

2270
02:17:55,895 --> 02:17:58,283
LAURA: Xanthas. He's my best friend.

2271
02:17:58,283 --> 02:18:03,014
MATT: It's more of a telepathic thing.

2272
02:18:03,014 --> 02:18:04,314
LAURA: Motherfuck!

2273
02:18:04,314 --> 02:18:05,597
MATT: You know what he's referring to.

2274
02:18:05,597 --> 02:18:07,003
TRAVIS: Have you been writing his name and your
name in your notebook?

2275
02:18:07,003 --> 02:18:08,421
LAURA: With hearts around it and everything.

2276
02:18:08,421 --> 02:18:18,823
MATT: You are such a lawyer. No, for this you're
going to keep taking shots at Grog.

2277
02:18:18,823 --> 02:18:21,133
LAURA: Fine!

2278
02:18:21,133 --> 02:18:25,077
TRAVIS: Now, there are lots of people to choose
from. She doesn't have to pick the most handsome.

2279
02:18:25,077 --> 02:18:29,045
LAURA: Hey Grog, what's your AC?

2280
02:18:29,045 --> 02:18:30,591
TRAVIS: Why, what did you do?

2281
02:18:30,591 --> 02:18:33,241
LAURA: Because I got a 26 and a 29.

2282
02:18:33,241 --> 02:18:37,330
MATT: Yeah, you get hit. And the first one gets
sneak attack damage because technically you're

2283
02:18:37,330 --> 02:18:39,067
working on--

2284
02:18:39,067 --> 02:18:40,651
LAURA: You!

2285
02:18:40,651 --> 02:18:42,267
LIAM: She just Boromir'd your ass.

2286
02:18:42,267 --> 02:18:47,275
MARISHA: Oh no! Not Boromir!

2287
02:18:47,275 --> 02:18:50,335
ASHLEY: Oh, are we going to die?

2288
02:18:50,335 --> 02:18:51,490
TRAVIS: Nope.

2289
02:18:51,490 --> 02:18:53,345
MARISHA: Boromir was my favorite.

2290
02:18:53,345 --> 02:18:55,786
ASHLEY: Scanlan, run in the tent.

2291
02:18:55,786 --> 02:18:57,070
LAURA: 17.

2292
02:18:57,070 --> 02:18:58,416
TRAVIS: What, damage?

2293
02:18:58,416 --> 02:18:59,523
LAURA: Piercing damage.

2294
02:18:59,523 --> 02:19:00,662
MATT: With the sneak attack?

2295
02:19:00,662 --> 02:19:03,182
LAURA: Halved. Huh? Yeah, that's with the sneak
attack.

2296
02:19:03,182 --> 02:19:06,189
MATT: Okay, so half of that it puts you at eight
points of piercing damage.

2297
02:19:06,189 --> 02:19:08,571
LAURA: And then, oh, four lightning damage.

2298
02:19:08,571 --> 02:19:11,395
TRAVIS: So four total.

2299
02:19:11,395 --> 02:19:17,250
LAURA: Oh, that's just the first attack! Oh no!
I'm sorry!

2300
02:19:17,250 --> 02:19:24,074
TALIESIN: Has no one noticed that she's doing this
yet, by the way? No one has commented that she's

2301
02:19:24,074 --> 02:19:25,157
doing this.

2302
02:19:25,157 --> 02:19:26,668
TRAVIS: Well, now I'm going to catch on.

2303
02:19:26,668 --> 02:19:28,531
LAURA: 20 on the second attack.

2304
02:19:28,531 --> 02:19:29,858
MATT: So ten.

2305
02:19:29,858 --> 02:19:32,376
LAURA: So ten damage on the second plus three
lightning.

2306
02:19:32,376 --> 02:19:33,842
MATT: Okay, so 13.

2307
02:19:33,842 --> 02:19:38,555
TRAVIS: 25. I'm keeping track of this.

2308
02:19:38,555 --> 02:19:39,798
LAURA: Oh shit.

2309
02:19:39,798 --> 02:19:41,160
MATT: Okay.

2310
02:19:41,160 --> 02:19:49,641
LAURA: (singing) I'm going to go because we don't
get a break because we're fighting.

2311
02:19:49,641 --> 02:19:53,936
LIAM: And stay down!

2312
02:19:53,936 --> 02:19:55,298
MATT: Okay Vax, you're up.

2313
02:19:55,298 --> 02:20:02,997
LIAM: All right, I want to a little mini curve and
go two squares this way and on the way I want to

2314
02:20:02,997 --> 02:20:06,538
throw, as a bonus action, throw my Flametongue
Dagger at my sister.

2315
02:20:06,538 --> 02:20:07,962
MATT: Okay.

2316
02:20:07,962 --> 02:20:18,948
LIAM: Yeah, so here we go. That hits, that's a 29.
So she takes a total of seven points of damage.

2317
02:20:18,948 --> 02:20:21,878
MATT: Okay, go ahead and mark that on her sheet
for her.

2318
02:20:21,878 --> 02:20:30,326
LIAM: Okay. Minus seven awesome points. And then I
want to walk up to the back of the giantess and

2319
02:20:30,326 --> 02:20:32,487
stab her in the calf.

2320
02:20:32,487 --> 02:20:33,822
MATT: Okay.

2321
02:20:33,822 --> 02:20:36,514
TALIESIN: She has a small cow?

2322
02:20:36,514 --> 02:20:38,822
LIAM: A natural 20.

2323
02:20:38,822 --> 02:20:41,884
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage on that.

2324
02:20:41,884 --> 02:20:43,277
TALIESIN: Wait, is that with sneak attack?

2325
02:20:43,277 --> 02:20:44,372
MATT: Yeah.

2326
02:20:44,372 --> 02:20:45,940
TALIESIN: Ooh! What! What?!

2327
02:20:45,940 --> 02:20:48,490
SAM: It's going to be like a million points of
damage.

2328
02:20:48,490 --> 02:20:52,612
TALIESIN: You're going to carve a Christmas animal
out of her.

2329
02:20:52,612 --> 02:20:54,366
LIAM: There are no numbers as high.

2330
02:20:54,366 --> 02:20:58,656
MARISHA: Yes. Get it. Get it! Big money, no
whammies!

2331
02:20:58,656 --> 02:21:03,933
SAM: This is a fun game.

2332
02:21:03,933 --> 02:21:07,404
MARISHA: This is great.

2333
02:21:07,404 --> 02:21:10,776
ASHLEY: I love Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

2334
02:21:10,776 --> 02:21:15,246
MARISHA: We don't know the damage on the inside
yet, but this is fine.

2335
02:21:15,246 --> 02:21:23,553
LIAM: Plus Hunter's Mark. Shit.

2336
02:21:23,553 --> 02:21:25,397
MATT: Which is also doubled, technically.

2337
02:21:25,397 --> 02:21:32,661
LIAM: Yeah I know. Did I-- yes I did. I forgot
just my straight-up bonus that doesn't get

2338
02:21:32,661 --> 02:21:39,596
doubled. That is 64 points of damage.

2339
02:21:39,596 --> 02:21:44,400
MATT: How do you want to do this?

2340
02:21:44,400 --> 02:21:46,950
(cheering)

2341
02:21:46,950 --> 02:21:48,278
TRAVIS: Yeah!

2342
02:21:48,278 --> 02:21:49,235
ASHLEY: Kill it!

2343
02:21:49,235 --> 02:21:50,206
MARISHA: Kill it!

2344
02:21:50,206 --> 02:21:55,512
LIAM: I want to to walk up and jab Whisper into
the back of her calf and then slide it up the back

2345
02:21:55,512 --> 02:22:01,173
of her leg, up the ass, up the small of her back
as high as I can reach. Probably around the

2346
02:22:01,173 --> 02:22:03,215
tailbone, I don't know.

2347
02:22:03,215 --> 02:22:09,050
MATT: Okay, as you jam it into the back of the
calf, the armor plates give way to the impact of

2348
02:22:09,050 --> 02:22:14,909
the blow. And she looks over her shoulder and
tries to swing the maul out backwards. You're too

2349
02:22:14,909 --> 02:22:20,959
low at this point as she pulls backwards, exposes
further up and you just drive the blade upward. As

2350
02:22:20,959 --> 02:22:27,484
you do you catch some sort of heavy vein as blood
begins to just gout out of the wound. And you keep

2351
02:22:27,484 --> 02:22:32,358
pushing upward, it won't go much past the thigh at
this point, but she turns around and starts going

2352
02:22:32,358 --> 02:22:41,794
unconscious from the rapid blood loss based on the
wounds she's already sustained. She takes her

2353
02:22:41,794 --> 02:22:47,672
hammer up to deliver a death blow down upon you
and as she goes to reach for you, her fingers lack

2354
02:22:47,672 --> 02:22:53,430
the strength to hold the blade and she tumbles
forward. You pass to the side, sidestepping as her

2355
02:22:53,430 --> 02:22:59,923
form slams into the dirt, knocking up dust around
her on the ground.

2356
02:22:59,923 --> 02:23:01,895
(air horn)

2357
02:23:01,895 --> 02:23:04,891
(laughter)

2358
02:23:04,891 --> 02:23:11,747
MATT: Vex, I need you to go ahead and roll a
wisdom saving throw.

2359
02:23:11,747 --> 02:23:13,656
LIAM: Because I stabbed you.

2360
02:23:13,656 --> 02:23:23,113
LAURA: Roll low, roll low! Oh, I mean roll high!
Roll high! Wisdom saving throw. 15.

2361
02:23:23,113 --> 02:23:28,781
MATT: 15 does not make it. However, technically,
and this was my fault before, you do have

2362
02:23:28,781 --> 02:23:34,422
advantage because it is a person who is not your
ally. Or they're fighting your allies.

2363
02:23:34,422 --> 02:23:36,557
LAURA: That's even worse.

2364
02:23:36,557 --> 02:23:40,025
MATT: Yep, so you're still dominated. Sorry.

2365
02:23:40,025 --> 02:23:43,447
LIAM: But at least you lost some hit points.

2366
02:23:43,447 --> 02:23:44,588
LAURA: Yay...

2367
02:23:44,588 --> 02:23:45,622
LIAM: Seven.

2368
02:23:45,622 --> 02:23:46,853
LAURA: I saw.

2369
02:23:46,853 --> 02:23:50,061
MATT: All right. So that ends Vax's turn, Keyleth,
you're up.

2370
02:23:50,061 --> 02:23:54,097
MARISHA: Okay so, I have the wyvern in my face?

2371
02:23:54,097 --> 02:23:56,639
MATT: You do, yes. And the wyvern rider.

2372
02:23:56,639 --> 02:23:59,912
MARISHA: And the wyvern rider? I'm going to do two
slam attacks.

2373
02:23:59,912 --> 02:24:01,903
MATT: To the wyvern or the rider?

2374
02:24:01,903 --> 02:24:03,661
MARISHA: What looks worse?

2375
02:24:03,661 --> 02:24:05,411
MATT: The wyvern.

2376
02:24:05,411 --> 02:24:06,920
MARISHA: The wyvern, then.

2377
02:24:06,920 --> 02:24:08,636
MATT: The wyvern rider hasn't really been hurt.

2378
02:24:08,636 --> 02:24:09,817
MARISHA: I'm going to take out the wyvern.

2379
02:24:09,817 --> 02:24:11,548
MATT: Okay go for it, roll two strikes.

2380
02:24:11,548 --> 02:24:23,113
MARISHA: Okay. Okay, what am I adding? Hang on.
Sorry, I'm the worst. Oh, plus five, okay so the

2381
02:24:23,113 --> 02:24:25,749
first one is 18.

2382
02:24:25,749 --> 02:24:27,463
MATT: 18? Hits.

2383
02:24:27,463 --> 02:24:32,580
MARISHA: And the second one is not as good. That's
a 14.

2384
02:24:32,580 --> 02:24:34,668
MATT: 14 also hits.

2385
02:24:34,668 --> 02:24:35,814
MARISHA: Really?

2386
02:24:35,814 --> 02:24:37,272
MATT: They don't have a high armor class.

2387
02:24:37,272 --> 02:24:39,108
MARISHA: Aw, so they each take...

2388
02:24:39,108 --> 02:24:41,648
MATT: They've got a fair amount of hit points for
their size, but their armor class isn't huge.

2389
02:24:41,648 --> 02:24:50,914
MARISHA: Okay cool, so the first one is good. 13
plus five so 18 for the first hit.

2390
02:24:50,914 --> 02:24:52,501
MATT: Okay.

2391
02:24:52,501 --> 02:24:59,945
MARISHA: And four plus three is seven plus five is
12. 12 for the second.

2392
02:24:59,945 --> 02:25:02,741
MATT: Gotcha. All right.

2393
02:25:02,741 --> 02:25:07,691
MARISHA: And then I'm going to use a bonus action.
I have never done this before. I'm going to use a

2394
02:25:07,691 --> 02:25:17,042
bonus action, as a Circle of the Moon druid, to
use one spell slot to heal 1d8 hit points.

2395
02:25:17,042 --> 02:25:19,073
MATT: Okay, go for it.

2396
02:25:19,073 --> 02:25:20,414
MARISHA: Ooh, seven! That's good!

2397
02:25:20,414 --> 02:25:23,841
MATT: All righty. So, as you slam the wyvern
twice, whack! Whack! You can see it's being

2398
02:25:23,841 --> 02:25:28,335
buffeted. The wings are trying to keep up from the
sheer amount of wind that's swirling around it. The

2399
02:25:28,335 --> 02:25:33,454
blows are almost knocking the rider off, and he's
spent most of his round trying to hold on to it.

2400
02:25:33,454 --> 02:25:36,973
It's looking pretty rough. It's barely keeping
itself up in the air, but it's still standing in

2401
02:25:36,973 --> 02:25:38,215
front of you.

2402
02:25:38,215 --> 02:25:39,535
MARISHA: Awesome.

2403
02:25:39,535 --> 02:25:42,507
MATT: All right. That ends your turn, Keyleth? All
right.

2404
02:25:42,507 --> 02:25:44,827
MARISHA: I'm going to keep him locked down.

2405
02:25:44,827 --> 02:25:51,004
MATT: Okay. It is not the general's turn, because
the general is currently dead. Percival.

2406
02:25:51,004 --> 02:25:58,298
TALIESIN: I'm going to peek out the tent, just one
step. I can see that the wyvern-- I take a look at

2407
02:25:58,298 --> 02:25:59,960
the field and I see that--

2408
02:25:59,960 --> 02:26:03,869
MARISHA: Sorry, sorry! Sorry, Jesus!

2409
02:26:03,869 --> 02:26:10,956
TALIESIN: Okay, so that's happening, but I can see
that we have a problem with Scanlan. So I'm going

2410
02:26:10,956 --> 02:26:17,131
to take some shots at the creatures that are
attacking Scanlan. I'm going to attack the wyvern,

2411
02:26:17,131 --> 02:26:18,229
not the rider.

2412
02:26:18,229 --> 02:26:19,545
MATT: Okay.

2413
02:26:19,545 --> 02:26:24,635
TALIESIN: First shot-- actually, you know what? I
haven't tried this yet, and this could be fun. I'm

2414
02:26:24,635 --> 02:26:27,980
going to try a piercing shot and see if I can hit
the rider and the wyvern.

2415
02:26:27,980 --> 02:26:31,318
MATT: I will say that yes, you can, because they
occupy the same space.

2416
02:26:31,318 --> 02:26:38,742
TALIESIN: So, starting with the wyvern, and then--
all right. Come on, don't be an asshole. Eh,

2417
02:26:38,742 --> 02:26:41,327
that's not terrible. 19?

2418
02:26:41,327 --> 02:26:44,148
MATT: 19 hits. So roll also for the--

2419
02:26:44,148 --> 02:26:50,568
TALIESIN: Oh, for the rider? That's 25.

2420
02:26:50,568 --> 02:26:57,177
MATT: Also hits, so with a single shot, it shoots
through the neck and actually pierces the shoulder

2421
02:26:57,177 --> 02:26:59,486
of the rider at the same time.

2422
02:26:59,486 --> 02:27:01,168
LAURA: That's sick.

2423
02:27:01,168 --> 02:27:03,251
MATT: Roll damage once, and it'll go for both of
them.

2424
02:27:03,251 --> 02:27:11,311
TALEISIN: So that's okay. That's 11 points of
damage and three points of psychic damage.

2425
02:27:11,311 --> 02:27:18,100
MATT: Okay, so they both take a total of 14 points
of damage. It hits them both. The rider is looking

2426
02:27:18,100 --> 02:27:21,476
really messed up from the impact. It looks like it
hit something on the neck and is now bleeding onto

2427
02:27:21,476 --> 02:27:26,361
its chest. It looks a little dazed from the
impact. The wyvern is hurt, wounded, and the other

2428
02:27:26,361 --> 02:27:31,390
guards are still stabbing at it with their
weapons. So it's not quite at death's door, but

2429
02:27:31,390 --> 02:27:32,804
it's looking pretty--

2430
02:27:32,804 --> 02:27:39,314
TALIESIN: I'm going to take another double shot at
the two of them. That's a 26 to hit.

2431
02:27:39,314 --> 02:27:40,536
MATT: Hits, all right.

2432
02:27:40,536 --> 02:27:43,887
TALIESIN: And then the second one, which jumped,
is 30 to hit.

2433
02:27:43,887 --> 02:27:46,398
MATT: Okay, so roll damage and then they both take
the next hit.

2434
02:27:46,398 --> 02:27:53,232
TALIESIN: Better. 15 points of normal damage,
three points of psychic damage.

2435
02:27:53,232 --> 02:27:59,763
MATT: So 18 total? This time, as the wyvern rears
up from the damage from the first impact, the pain

2436
02:27:59,763 --> 02:28:06,300
causing it to put its wings out and puff up, it
goes through the wing and takes out the temple of

2437
02:28:06,300 --> 02:28:09,587
the rider. The rider is immediately killed and
falls off the back.

2438
02:28:09,587 --> 02:28:15,092
TALIESIN: Which means I still have one shot left.

2439
02:28:15,092 --> 02:28:20,531
MATT: The wyvern is now in the process of trying
to get its wings up. It's realized how badly it's

2440
02:28:20,531 --> 02:28:22,006
hurt and is going to attempt to flee.

2441
02:28:22,006 --> 02:28:28,148
TALIESIN: That's fine. I'm going to take one more
shot. I'm going to do a sharpshooter shot at the

2442
02:28:28,148 --> 02:28:33,193
wyvern. I'm also going to, just to be an asshole,
I'm going to do a push shot at him. I'm going to

2443
02:28:33,193 --> 02:28:41,979
do a torso push. So that's, double-checking, okay.
That's fucking terrible. God damn it. Again.

2444
02:28:41,979 --> 02:28:51,369
MATT: Again? He's going to aim and the same
mechanism-- You're having a reverse Percy day.

2445
02:28:51,369 --> 02:28:54,798
Wow! There is balance!

2446
02:28:54,798 --> 02:28:58,058
TALIESIN: And another ten points of psychic
damage.

2447
02:28:58,058 --> 02:29:01,745
LIAM: This is just balancing for the Thordak
fight. It's all right.

2448
02:29:01,745 --> 02:29:07,515
TALIESIN: And I've lost that grit point, because I
burned that grit point on the bird. So, ow! Run

2449
02:29:07,515 --> 02:29:09,969
back in the tent. God damn it.

2450
02:29:09,969 --> 02:29:13,380
MATT: All right, that finishes Percy's turn.

2451
02:29:13,380 --> 02:29:15,737
TALIESIN: And deep into the tent. Like, halfway
into the tent.

2452
02:29:15,737 --> 02:29:17,095
MATT: Scanlan, you're up.

2453
02:29:17,095 --> 02:29:18,429
SAM: I'm up?

2454
02:29:18,429 --> 02:29:20,870
MATT: Just curled up and shaking.

2455
02:29:20,870 --> 02:29:27,546
SAM: Okay. My Bigby's Hand is still working,
right?

2456
02:29:27,546 --> 02:29:29,874
MATT: Yeah, you didn't break concentration.

2457
02:29:29,874 --> 02:29:32,698
SAM: I can move it, how far?

2458
02:29:32,698 --> 02:29:37,879
MATT: You can move it--

2459
02:29:37,879 --> 02:29:43,923
SAM: Move it up to 60 feet. Is that going to get
back to me in time?

2460
02:29:43,923 --> 02:29:47,699
MATT: To you? Yeah. You can get it to anything in
the battlefield.

2461
02:29:47,699 --> 02:29:51,637
SAM: I want it to do a 60-foot punch on the wyvern
in front of me.

2462
02:29:51,637 --> 02:29:55,298
MATT: Go ahead and roll.

2463
02:29:55,298 --> 02:29:56,537
TRAVIS: Hadouken!

2464
02:29:56,537 --> 02:29:58,124
SAM: Okay.

2465
02:29:58,124 --> 02:30:00,766
TRAVIS: Tiger!

2466
02:30:00,766 --> 02:30:09,564
TALIESIN: I did well, and then I jammed again.
I've done, like, 30 points of damage to myself.

2467
02:30:09,564 --> 02:30:13,037
SAM: Oh wait, I have to do a spell attack first.

2468
02:30:13,037 --> 02:30:15,209
LAURA: I've done more than that to everybody
else.

2469
02:30:15,209 --> 02:30:17,395
SAM: No! 15.

2470
02:30:17,395 --> 02:30:21,481
MATT: 15 hits. Armor class is low on the wyverns.

2471
02:30:21,481 --> 02:30:37,129
SAM: So then, oh, it's a lot. It's already up to
26. Oh. 42.

2472
02:30:37,129 --> 02:30:44,069
MATT: Okay. The wyvern begins lifting up in the
air, trying to escape now. It's sitting here,

2473
02:30:44,069 --> 02:30:49,180
whipping out. The guards are backing up, afraid to
get too close. You see Scanlan concentrating. As

2474
02:30:49,180 --> 02:30:54,485
the wyvern gets about 15 feet off the ground,
Bigby's Hand swoops up, grabs it, and then plants

2475
02:30:54,485 --> 02:30:57,023
it right onto the jagged rock behind it, piercing
it--

2476
02:30:57,023 --> 02:31:01,293
TRAVIS: You made wyvern juice!

2477
02:31:01,293 --> 02:31:05,413
MATT: It weakly goes limp against the bladed
rock.

2478
02:31:05,413 --> 02:31:07,574
LAURA: Sick.

2479
02:31:07,574 --> 02:31:11,574
MATT: That was your bonus action. You still have
your action and your movement, if you like. The

2480
02:31:11,574 --> 02:31:15,145
two guards next to you are like, "We're at your
aid, sir!"

2481
02:31:15,145 --> 02:31:20,865
SAM: I might need it. Flank me! We're going into
battle!

2482
02:31:20,865 --> 02:31:27,036
TRAVIS: "Flank me." I don't think that means what
you think it means.

2483
02:31:27,036 --> 02:31:31,165
SAM: So I'll-- I still have an action, right?

2484
02:31:31,165 --> 02:31:33,298
MATT: Action and movement, yeah.

2485
02:31:33,298 --> 02:31:42,581
SAM: I should probably heal myself, right? Nah.
I'll run toward the fight. Oh wait, there's a

2486
02:31:42,581 --> 02:31:46,640
wyvern right there, isn't there? Ooh, I don't want
them to kill me.

2487
02:31:46,640 --> 02:31:48,486
MARISHA: There's also a wyvern on my ass.

2488
02:31:48,486 --> 02:31:56,496
SAM: All right, I'll attack the wyvern next to
Marisha's ass. I mean, Keyleth's ass. With another

2489
02:31:56,496 --> 02:31:58,134
Lightning Bolt.

2490
02:31:58,134 --> 02:31:59,497
MATT: Okay.

2491
02:31:59,497 --> 02:32:01,374
SAM: I have one more level three spell.

2492
02:32:01,374 --> 02:32:10,316
MATT: All righty, so the wyvern makes a-- Not with
a two, it doesn't. And for the rider. The rider

2493
02:32:10,316 --> 02:32:12,259
does get a natural 20, so it does take half
damage.

2494
02:32:12,259 --> 02:32:16,966
SAM: Okay. So 8d6. I got it.

2495
02:32:16,966 --> 02:32:20,527
LIAM: What's it like looking at this shirt-mare
all night?

2496
02:32:20,527 --> 02:32:22,692
MATT: I'm trying not to.

2497
02:32:22,692 --> 02:32:25,242
LIAM: Hey, my eyes are up here.

2498
02:32:25,242 --> 02:32:31,019
MATT: It's a great exercise in focus.

2499
02:32:31,019 --> 02:32:34,270
SAM: 23.

2500
02:32:34,270 --> 02:32:46,054
MATT: I hate you so much. With that, the rider
takes the impact of the Lightning Bolt and whips

2501
02:32:46,054 --> 02:32:51,612
its head back around angrily. However, the wyvern
beneath it gets blasted by the bolt of lightning

2502
02:32:51,612 --> 02:32:56,907
and throws it back. The rider gets just enough
back, and the wyvern falls to the ground,

2503
02:32:56,907 --> 02:32:59,104
unconscious and slowly dying.

2504
02:32:59,104 --> 02:33:02,234
MARISHA: You got that wyvern on my ass! Thanks,
man!

2505
02:33:02,234 --> 02:33:11,267
SAM: And then I use my movement to grab both of
the guards and cower behind them. Close them like

2506
02:33:11,267 --> 02:33:12,467
a door in front of me.

2507
02:33:12,467 --> 02:33:16,216
MATT: Okay, so you move behind them, guarding you
right there. You now have two bodyguards flanking

2508
02:33:16,216 --> 02:33:26,148
you at that moment. All right. It is Xanthas'
turn, now.

2509
02:33:26,148 --> 02:33:33,629
LAURA: (groaning) I mean, he's so cool, but I
mean, he sucks a little bit.

2510
02:33:33,629 --> 02:33:35,368
MARISHA: He's not that cool.

2511
02:33:35,368 --> 02:33:37,334
LAURA: No, I mean, he's really cool, you guys.
He's the coolest.

2512
02:33:37,334 --> 02:33:45,379
MATT: He sees the giant fall, but the firebird is
still in combat. There's other wyverns floating

2513
02:33:45,379 --> 02:33:49,279
around, some being taken down in the distance from
other guards. It looks like the tide of battle is

2514
02:33:49,279 --> 02:33:53,928
shifting, now, at this point. You guys, in helping
out the guys around you, both gave a morale boost

2515
02:33:53,928 --> 02:33:58,924
and shifted the tide. You can see, the other
wyverns, the lizardmen, have been for the most

2516
02:33:58,924 --> 02:34:03,865
part dispatched within the courtyard around you.
However, Xanthas, looking down and seeing the

2517
02:34:03,865 --> 02:34:15,338
circumstance, kind of, "Uh, um, argh!" Releases
his hand. This is going to be against you, Vax.

2518
02:34:15,338 --> 02:34:18,881
This is going to be a Chain Lighting.

2519
02:34:18,881 --> 02:34:23,573
LIAM: I will use Evasion, of course.

2520
02:34:23,573 --> 02:34:26,049
LAURA: That's good, that's good.

2521
02:34:26,049 --> 02:34:33,277
MATT: That's a good call on that one. All right.
Chain Lighting's a little bit of a bitch, here.

2522
02:34:33,277 --> 02:34:42,109
Let me pull it up. There we go. Sixth level. All
right, so, I need Vax, Grog, and Pike to all make

2523
02:34:42,109 --> 02:34:43,620
dexterity saving throws.

2524
02:34:43,620 --> 02:34:45,967
LAURA: Roll so high!

2525
02:34:45,967 --> 02:34:47,721
TRAVIS: Danger Sense!

2526
02:34:47,721 --> 02:34:49,482
SAM: Ashley Johnson!

2527
02:34:49,482 --> 02:34:51,402
LAURA: Ashley Jenkins!

2528
02:34:51,402 --> 02:34:55,209
ASHLEY: 15.

2529
02:34:55,209 --> 02:34:58,251
LIAM: I didn't do too well. I only got 14.

2530
02:34:58,251 --> 02:34:59,517
TRAVIS: 17.

2531
02:34:59,517 --> 02:35:01,318
MATT: Okay, both of you fail. What did you get?

2532
02:35:01,318 --> 02:35:02,272
LIAM: 14.

2533
02:35:02,272 --> 02:35:03,781
MATT: All three of you fail.

2534
02:35:03,781 --> 02:35:05,198
LIAM: Half damage for me.

2535
02:35:05,198 --> 02:35:06,836
TRAVIS: What'd you have to roll to succeed?

2536
02:35:06,836 --> 02:35:09,390
ASHLEY: I was just going to take my turn!

2537
02:35:09,390 --> 02:35:16,585
MATT: I know! Well, that is 50 points.

2538
02:35:16,585 --> 02:35:17,930
TRAVIS: Five zero?!

2539
02:35:17,930 --> 02:35:23,045
MATT: Five zero. 50 points of lightning damage to
Pike, Vax, and Grog. It's a 6th-level spell, and

2540
02:35:23,045 --> 02:35:25,053
he had a pretty damn high roll, actually.

2541
02:35:25,053 --> 02:35:26,353
ASHLEY: I hate him!

2542
02:35:26,353 --> 02:35:33,039
MATT: So yeah. You take half that damage.

2543
02:35:33,039 --> 02:35:35,219
LAURA: (gasps) You're alive!

2544
02:35:35,219 --> 02:35:37,372
ASHLEY: Oh, that's true!

2545
02:35:37,372 --> 02:35:40,147
LAURA: You're wearing your armor!

2546
02:35:40,147 --> 02:35:44,120
ASHLEY: If you're knocked unconscious by an attack
or spell, a blast of healing flames surrounds you!

2547
02:35:44,120 --> 02:35:50,563
You immediately regain five hit points and are
lifted to your feet. All hostile creatures within

2548
02:35:50,563 --> 02:35:53,983
15 feet of you must make a dexterity saving
throw.

2549
02:35:53,983 --> 02:35:55,925
LAURA: Or take fire damage.

2550
02:35:55,925 --> 02:35:58,776
MATT: Or take fire damage, yeah. It doesn't affect
the creature. You guys watch as the lightning

2551
02:35:58,776 --> 02:36:06,569
streaks out from the top of the wall. Slams into
the back of Vax, who-- You arc up, your whole body

2552
02:36:06,569 --> 02:36:12,653
seizing at the sudden burst of electrical energy,
which then bursts outward into Grog and Pike.

2553
02:36:12,653 --> 02:36:17,766
Grog, it hits you and your muscles tense and you
drop the axe for a second. You reach down and push

2554
02:36:17,766 --> 02:36:22,678
through the pain and pick it back up. Pike, it
slams into you and you watch as the light shines

2555
02:36:22,678 --> 02:36:28,644
up around you, the smoke emanating from underneath
the plate armor. You fall to the ground. There's a

2556
02:36:28,644 --> 02:36:34,357
brief moment of silence, and then suddenly, this
bright reddish-orange energy bursts out from

2557
02:36:34,357 --> 02:36:40,126
beneath the armor, through the neck, through the
sides of the plate, and you lift up about three or

2558
02:36:40,126 --> 02:36:44,219
four feet off the ground before landing back on
the ground, restored with a little bit of health.

2559
02:36:44,219 --> 02:36:46,726
This burst of flame arcs out around you.

2560
02:36:46,726 --> 02:36:49,461
TRAVIS: Jean Grey! That's amazing!

2561
02:36:49,461 --> 02:36:51,844
ASHELY: I growl!

2562
02:36:51,844 --> 02:36:58,480
MATT: Xanthas then goes, "Okay!" and darts back
inside.

2563
02:36:58,480 --> 02:37:01,413
LAURA: I hate him!

2564
02:37:01,413 --> 02:37:02,954
ASHLEY: He's the worst!

2565
02:37:02,954 --> 02:37:05,793
MATT: All right, that brings us to Pike.

2566
02:37:05,793 --> 02:37:17,001
ASHLEY: Okay! I sound so puny with this voice! I'm
going to try my tried and true pal, Guiding Bolt!

2567
02:37:17,001 --> 02:37:23,931
I'm going to Guiding Bolt at fifth level, right in
the belly of the beast.

2568
02:37:23,931 --> 02:37:30,302
MATT: So you're going to turn around to this
giant, angry ember-roc and Guiding Bolt it into

2569
02:37:30,302 --> 02:37:37,792
the stomach. All righty. Let's get over here for
that assault. At fifth level, you said? All

2570
02:37:37,792 --> 02:37:45,798
righty, that would be 8d6 radiant damage if you
hit. You make a ranged spell attack. It is right

2571
02:37:45,798 --> 02:37:53,666
up against you in a ranged format, so you're
probably going to have to step back because it is

2572
02:37:53,666 --> 02:37:55,783
ranged. Or it's disadvantage to hit. Up to you.

2573
02:37:55,783 --> 02:37:58,553
LAURA: Don't take a step back, he'll hit you!

2574
02:37:58,553 --> 02:38:00,414
ASHLEY: Maybe he'll fail!

2575
02:38:00,414 --> 02:38:02,226
MARISHA: Would he get a strike of opportunity on
her?

2576
02:38:02,226 --> 02:38:05,010
MATT: He might. It's your call. Or take
disadvantage on the strike, because it is a ranged

2577
02:38:05,010 --> 02:38:06,902
attack.

2578
02:38:06,902 --> 02:38:12,415
MARISHA: Wait, wait. Is it the big bird? He might
have reach. It might not be out of his range.

2579
02:38:12,415 --> 02:38:17,663
MATT: If you're still within melee with him,
you'll have to step out of melee to not get the

2580
02:38:17,663 --> 02:38:23,459
disadvantage. In doing that, he might get an
attack of opportunity on you. It's not just within

2581
02:38:23,459 --> 02:38:25,319
five feet, it's getting out of the creature's
ability.

2582
02:38:25,319 --> 02:38:27,333
ASHLEY: I'll do the disadvantage.

2583
02:38:27,333 --> 02:38:31,799
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll twice, adding your
spell attack.

2584
02:38:31,799 --> 02:38:33,401
MARISHA: Big money, no whammies.

2585
02:38:33,401 --> 02:38:38,495
ASHLEY: Adding my spell attack? Okay. So, 14.

2586
02:38:38,495 --> 02:38:39,854
MATT: Okay, roll again.

2587
02:38:39,854 --> 02:38:41,899
LAURA: No, that was with disadvantage.

2588
02:38:41,899 --> 02:38:43,539
ASHLEY: I rolled two at the same time.

2589
02:38:43,539 --> 02:38:44,995
MATT: Oh, with disadvantage? That does hit,
actually.

2590
02:38:44,995 --> 02:38:45,979
ASHLEY: It does?

2591
02:38:45,979 --> 02:38:47,817
MATT: Just barely. It doesn't have a high armor.

2592
02:38:47,817 --> 02:39:03,778
ASHLEY: Ooh! Okay, so 8d6? Okay, so how many of
these, (counting). Oh, these were bad rolls. Well,

2593
02:39:03,778 --> 02:39:09,525
that's a-- (counting)

2594
02:39:09,525 --> 02:39:11,720
SAM: No break tonight, guys.

2595
02:39:11,720 --> 02:39:15,808
MATT: Nope, sorry. We've been off for two weeks.

2596
02:39:15,808 --> 02:39:23,980
ASHLEY: Do I add anything? It's just those? 22.

2597
02:39:24,173 --> 02:39:30,688
MATT: 22 points of radiant damage against it. As
you blast it, this giant flash of divine energy

2598
02:39:30,688 --> 02:39:35,245
bursts around it, causing this glittering beacon.
The next attack against it has advantage, period.

2599
02:39:35,245 --> 02:39:41,113
You can see the creature itself, its flames are
starting to flicker. It looks angry, and it looks

2600
02:39:41,113 --> 02:39:45,955
wounded. That end your turn, Pike? Are you going
to move? Oh, you can bonus action with the sword

2601
02:39:45,955 --> 02:39:49,983
toward it and attack it if you want. So go ahead
and make another spell attack.

2602
02:39:49,983 --> 02:39:54,970
ASHLEY: Okay. Guh.

2603
02:39:54,970 --> 02:39:58,316
LAURA: That hit, because you needed a 14.

2604
02:39:58,316 --> 02:39:59,876
ASHLEY: Oh yeah.

2605
02:39:59,876 --> 02:40:01,863
MATT: So, 1d8 plus five, if it's higher than what
you last rolled.

2606
02:40:01,863 --> 02:40:04,099
ASHLEY: 1d8 plus five.

2607
02:40:04,099 --> 02:40:05,288
MATT: Grog, you're up next.

2608
02:40:05,288 --> 02:40:06,469
TRAVIS: Yep.

2609
02:40:06,469 --> 02:40:12,157
ASHLEY: 11.

2610
02:40:12,157 --> 02:40:14,962
MATT: 11? To hit?

2611
02:40:14,962 --> 02:40:17,080
ASHLEY: No, 11 damage.

2612
02:40:17,080 --> 02:40:23,004
MATT: Oh, damage, sorry. 11 damage to the
creature. So, as the blade arcs past, striking

2613
02:40:23,004 --> 02:40:27,024
again, you can see another flash of divine energy.
Technically that would've had advantage, I just

2614
02:40:27,024 --> 02:40:30,647
realized, because that's the next attack against
it. So roll again.

2615
02:40:30,647 --> 02:40:32,110
ASHLEY: Roll that again?

2616
02:40:32,110 --> 02:40:33,215
MATT: Roll the d20 again.

2617
02:40:33,215 --> 02:40:34,912
LAURA: Oh, because if you get a critical--

2618
02:40:34,912 --> 02:40:37,250
ASHLEY: Ooh, yeah, that hits.

2619
02:40:37,250 --> 02:40:40,774
MATT: Okay, so it's fine. I was seeing if it was
going to critical or not.

2620
02:40:40,774 --> 02:40:43,299
ASHLEY: So another? Oh, oh, sorry.

2621
02:40:43,299 --> 02:40:45,593
MATT: Yeah, because the Guiding Bolt gave
advantage on the next attack, and the next attack

2622
02:40:45,593 --> 02:40:50,089
was the sword. So the beacon fades. It is now
Grog's turn.

2623
02:40:50,089 --> 02:40:57,184
TRAVIS: Stupid big bird! I run over and I would
like to hit the giant flaming piece of shit.

2624
02:40:57,184 --> 02:41:11,824
Reckless, Great Weapon Master. All the lasagna. 31
minus five is 27.

2625
02:41:11,824 --> 02:41:13,689
MATT: That hits.

2626
02:41:13,689 --> 02:41:16,180
TRAVIS: No, 31 minus five is 26.

2627
02:41:16,180 --> 02:41:17,681
LAURA: It doesn't matter, it hits.

2628
02:41:17,681 --> 02:41:20,932
MATT: You have to roll a 14 or higher to hit.

2629
02:41:20,932 --> 02:41:23,889
TRAVIS: That's good to know. That's a 17.

2630
02:41:23,889 --> 02:41:29,435
MATT: 17 hits. That's higher than 14.

2631
02:41:29,435 --> 02:41:33,811
TRAVIS: And I'll do all three. 14.

2632
02:41:33,811 --> 02:41:36,726
MATT: 14 hits, yeah. So, all three hit.

2633
02:41:36,726 --> 02:41:38,489
SAM: Kaboom, kaboom, ka-blow.

2634
02:41:38,489 --> 02:41:48,328
TRAVIS: 20, 21, 31. 31.

2635
02:41:48,328 --> 02:41:50,818
MATT: 31? All righty.

2636
02:41:50,818 --> 02:41:57,719
TRAVIS: Eight, 21, 24, 34.

2637
02:41:57,719 --> 02:41:59,306
MATT: All right, 34?

2638
02:41:59,306 --> 02:42:06,093
TRAVIS: Yeah. Six, 19, 21, 31.

2639
02:42:06,093 --> 02:42:07,496
MATT: Okay.

2640
02:42:07,496 --> 02:42:09,728
How do you want to do this?

2641
02:42:09,728 --> 02:42:17,200
TRAVIS: I hit it twice with my axe, and with the
third one I pick up Pike and I use her to slice

2642
02:42:17,200 --> 02:42:22,073
the bird open! Come on, Pikey-poo!

2643
02:42:22,073 --> 02:42:28,858
MATT: Wielding Pike like a two-handed gnome, you
drop the axe on the first two strikes, the

2644
02:42:28,858 --> 02:42:34,267
creature stepping backward. You jump up in the air
and, getting about neck-height, you swing Pike

2645
02:42:34,267 --> 02:42:38,774
with all your strength. Pike, you feel your jowls
get pulled from the g-forces of the sheer strength

2646
02:42:38,774 --> 02:42:43,993
of the arc. What weapon are you using in the
battle?

2647
02:42:43,993 --> 02:42:47,804
ASHLEY: Oh, I'm using my Mace of Disruption.

2648
02:42:47,804 --> 02:42:54,403
MATT: So as the mace comes through, it slams into
the side of the skull of the ember roc. Your hands

2649
02:42:54,403 --> 02:43:01,482
go numb from the impact as the vibration shivers
through your body. You watch as the beak and the

2650
02:43:01,482 --> 02:43:06,353
side of the skull crack and cave inward. With a
little (squeak) sound, it just falls over on the

2651
02:43:06,353 --> 02:43:09,613
ground.

2652
02:43:09,613 --> 02:43:12,732
AHSLEY: Yeah! Grog, it felt like I did it!

2653
02:43:12,732 --> 02:43:16,057
TRAVIS: You did do it! Monstah! Give me a growl!

2654
02:43:16,057 --> 02:43:22,488
ASHLEY: Arrr! I'm a monstah!

2655
02:43:22,488 --> 02:43:27,490
MARISHA: That was the cutest thing!

2656
02:43:27,490 --> 02:43:33,983
TRAVIS: I turn around and I look up at Vex and I
say, fucking cut it out!

2657
02:43:33,983 --> 02:43:36,621
LAURA: I say, good job! I'm going to hit you in a
minute!

2658
02:43:36,621 --> 02:43:40,985
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right, we still have him and
her.

2659
02:43:40,985 --> 02:43:45,771
MATT: All right, so we go back to the first round.
The two soldiers that are guarding you are like,

2660
02:43:45,771 --> 02:43:49,363
"What would you like, sir? Where are we going?"

2661
02:43:49,363 --> 02:43:53,465
SAM: Is anyone out there who wants to kill me?

2662
02:43:53,465 --> 02:43:57,275
MARISHA: There's still the guy on the ground.
Right under my face.

2663
02:43:57,275 --> 02:44:03,474
SAM: You two go kill that guy, I'll go somewhere
else!

2664
02:44:03,474 --> 02:44:06,555
MATT: Okay. They both, using their full--

2665
02:44:06,555 --> 02:44:08,660
LIAM: Just killed a pit fiend.

2666
02:44:08,660 --> 02:44:12,329
MATT: They get all the way up to it. They don't
have a chance to attack, but they're surrounding

2667
02:44:12,329 --> 02:44:16,658
it with their weapons drawn. They're going to
probably brutalize it pretty badly next round. All

2668
02:44:16,658 --> 02:44:26,111
right. For the purposes of this round, too, you
hear a sound from up in the hallway, where Xanthas

2669
02:44:26,111 --> 02:44:35,055
was. (pained shout) You watch as Xanthas goes
flying out a few feet and lands on his back. You

2670
02:44:35,055 --> 02:44:45,784
watch as a small, brown bit of hair races across,
a giant, gleaming Holy Avenger goes across the air--

2671
02:44:45,784 --> 02:44:47,547
TRAVIS: Yes! Platinum greatsword!

2672
02:44:47,547 --> 02:44:48,961
LAURA: Who was it?! It's Kima?

2673
02:44:48,961 --> 02:44:50,043
MATT: It's Kima.

2674
02:44:50,043 --> 02:44:52,017
(yelling)

2675
02:44:52,017 --> 02:44:58,448
MATT: She says, "Bahamut strike you down, you
knife-eared son of a bitch!" The blade coming down--

2676
02:44:58,448 --> 02:45:02,455
SAM: Defenestrated.

2677
02:45:02,455 --> 02:45:04,779
(laughter)

2678
02:45:04,779 --> 02:45:12,497
MATT: Here we go. That is a 15 to hit. That hits
against his armor class. And a natural 20.

2679
02:45:12,497 --> 02:45:14,653
MARISHA: Get it girl.

2680
02:45:14,653 --> 02:45:16,405
TRAVIS: End him. End him.

2681
02:45:16,405 --> 02:45:18,406
LAURA: Does he need to make a constitution check?

2682
02:45:18,406 --> 02:45:22,731
MATT: Oh, he will. It is a concentration spell.
Ooh, double sixes on the first one.

2683
02:45:22,731 --> 02:45:24,262
TRAVIS: Don't you wanna shoot me again?

2684
02:45:24,262 --> 02:45:28,063
LAURA: I'm pretty sure. No, right now I definitely
want to shoot you again.

2685
02:45:28,063 --> 02:45:29,566
TRAVIS: Oh, okay.

2686
02:45:29,566 --> 02:45:48,649
MATT: 21 points of damage on the first strike. On
the critical, that is 25. Oof, that's rough. So,

2687
02:45:48,649 --> 02:45:52,611
having to make a concentration check on both on
those. The first one is a 15, succeeds on the

2688
02:45:52,611 --> 02:45:54,825
first hit. The second one does not!

2689
02:45:54,825 --> 02:45:56,393
LAURA: Yes!

2690
02:45:56,393 --> 02:45:59,607
MATT: It's half damage, he rolled a ten, he needed
to roll 13 or higher.

2691
02:45:59,607 --> 02:46:01,109
MARISHA: That was on the critical, right?

2692
02:46:01,109 --> 02:46:06,046
MATT: Yeah, it was on the critical. So the
concentration spell ends, you have control of your

2693
02:46:06,046 --> 02:46:07,282
mind again.

2694
02:46:07,282 --> 02:46:08,902
LAURA: Tell me it's my turn.

2695
02:46:08,902 --> 02:46:12,750
MATT: After that and Kima unloading on him, yes,
it is.

2696
02:46:12,750 --> 02:46:14,023
ASHLEY: Yeah, get him.

2697
02:46:14,023 --> 02:46:15,606
TRAVIS: How many points of damage did he take?

2698
02:46:15,606 --> 02:46:23,667
MATT: From that total round, with the Divine Smite
from her strike, he took 62 points of damage from her.

2699
02:46:23,667 --> 02:46:27,235
LAURA: I'm gonna fly right above him and shoot
directly down onto his face.

2700
02:46:27,235 --> 02:46:28,532
MATT: Okay.

2701
02:46:28,532 --> 02:46:31,321
(laughter)

2702
02:46:31,321 --> 02:46:37,174
MATT: You coast over, looking down at him on the
ground. He is prone currently, so you have

2703
02:46:37,174 --> 02:46:38,624
disadvantage on the attacks.

2704
02:46:38,624 --> 02:46:40,724
LAURA: (triumphant laughter) And Kima's standing
next to him?

2705
02:46:40,724 --> 02:46:41,962
MATT: Yeah.

2706
02:46:41,962 --> 02:46:43,321
MATT: Disadvantage.

2707
02:46:43,321 --> 02:46:44,412
LAURA: Oh, he's prone?

2708
02:46:44,412 --> 02:46:45,470
MATT: He's prone.

2709
02:46:45,470 --> 02:46:47,058
LAURA: Why do I get disadvantage because he's
prone?

2710
02:46:47,058 --> 02:46:49,513
MATT: It's ranged attack, so when things are on
the ground, they're a little harder--

2711
02:46:49,513 --> 02:46:53,846
LIAM: If Kima's next to him, as a rogue, does it
cancel out and she gets advantage from her ally?

2712
02:46:53,846 --> 02:46:57,338
MATT: You don't get advantage from an ally being
adjacent. You get to sneak attack them if they're

2713
02:46:57,338 --> 02:46:58,478
adjacent.

2714
02:46:58,478 --> 02:46:59,565
LIAM: Thanks.

2715
02:46:59,565 --> 02:47:00,856
MATT: No worries.

2716
02:47:00,856 --> 02:47:01,892
SAM: You got this.

2717
02:47:01,892 --> 02:47:05,964
LAURA: Psh. Six-- no, 18?

2718
02:47:05,964 --> 02:47:09,805
MATT: Hits. His armor class isn't very high. He's
a little mage dude.

2719
02:47:09,805 --> 02:47:12,657
LAURA: 18, and the other one definitely hits. 20.

2720
02:47:12,657 --> 02:47:14,534
MATT: Yeah, both still hit with disadvantage.

2721
02:47:14,534 --> 02:47:15,737
TRAVIS: Nice!

2722
02:47:15,737 --> 02:47:16,797
MATT: And you get sneak attack--

2723
02:47:16,797 --> 02:47:18,345
LAURA: And I Hunter's Mark him because he's a
fucking dick!

2724
02:47:18,345 --> 02:47:24,864
MATT: All right. You do get sneak attack on the
first hit because Kima is adjacent to him.

2725
02:47:24,864 --> 02:47:38,297
LAURA: Well, all right. 18. Where's my dice? 28 on
the first hit!

2726
02:47:38,297 --> 02:47:40,331
MATT: 28 on the first hit, nice.

2727
02:47:40,331 --> 02:47:46,037
ASHLEY: He made a mistake.

2728
02:47:46,037 --> 02:47:47,698
LAURA: 13.

2729
02:47:47,698 --> 02:47:49,629
TRAVIS: He made a mistake.

2730
02:47:49,629 --> 02:47:53,048
LAURA: 17 on the second hit.

2731
02:47:53,048 --> 02:47:54,903
MATT: 17 on the second hit?

2732
02:47:54,903 --> 02:47:55,971
LAURA: Yeah.

2733
02:47:55,971 --> 02:47:57,118
MATT: How do you want to do this?

2734
02:47:57,118 --> 02:47:58,835
(cheering)

2735
02:47:58,835 --> 02:48:01,482
MARISHA: He was always an asshole! Always.

2736
02:48:01,482 --> 02:48:04,587
LAURA: That's right. I'm gonna say, I always
thought you were a dick back in Emon. Don't fuck

2737
02:48:04,587 --> 02:48:07,336
with me! Then I shoot him straight through the
face.

2738
02:48:07,336 --> 02:48:09,491
MATT: As he's on the ground--

2739
02:48:09,491 --> 02:48:11,695
TALIESIN: His heart breaks before the arrow hits.

2740
02:48:11,695 --> 02:48:12,943
(laughter)

2741
02:48:12,943 --> 02:48:14,523
MARISHA: He always had a crush on you!

2742
02:48:14,523 --> 02:48:15,946
(laughter)

2743
02:48:15,946 --> 02:48:19,948
MATT: He puts his finger up as you nock the first
arrow, and he goes "Wait, I--" and the first arrow

2744
02:48:19,948 --> 02:48:24,836
hits him in the shoulder. He's like "No, (nervous
laughter) we can--" and he gets that far into the

2745
02:48:24,836 --> 02:48:29,276
second sentence before the arrow (impact) through
his face. (whimpers, trails off) And the finger

2746
02:48:29,276 --> 02:48:31,733
goes limp as his eyes go a little dead in the
face.

2747
02:48:31,733 --> 02:48:33,114
LIAM: Slightly sad.

2748
02:48:33,114 --> 02:48:35,119
LAURA: I turn back round and I go, sorry, Grog.

2749
02:48:35,119 --> 02:48:38,378
MATT: Kima looks up and you and goes, (frustrated
noise) "He was mine!"

2750
02:48:38,378 --> 02:48:41,150
LAURA: No, Kima. He was mine.

2751
02:48:41,150 --> 02:48:43,412
(laughter)

2752
02:48:43,412 --> 02:48:45,651
MATT: She takes the blade and (impact) stabs him
anyway.

2753
02:48:45,651 --> 02:48:47,317
(laughter)

2754
02:48:47,317 --> 02:48:52,800
MATT: You see some of the wyverns, the few
surviving now, are starting to scatter and head

2755
02:48:52,800 --> 02:48:57,286
back towards Emon. It looks like the ranks have
broken and the tide has definitely turned at this

2756
02:48:57,286 --> 02:49:02,173
point. As you all begin to gather yourselves, the
last lizard man on the ground over there is just

2757
02:49:02,173 --> 02:49:06,890
being repeatedly stabbed by the guards until it's
no longer moving, and bludgeoned by the air

2758
02:49:06,890 --> 02:49:10,477
elemental that's lording over it. You begin to
gather yourselves to consider the next course of

2759
02:49:10,477 --> 02:49:12,136
action. We're going to take a quick bathroom
break--

2760
02:49:12,136 --> 02:49:15,315
LAURA: At ten o'clock, a bathroom break?

2761
02:49:15,315 --> 02:49:16,897
MARISHA: Quick bathroom break.

2762
02:49:16,897 --> 02:49:18,426
SAM: We need a pause.

2763
02:49:18,426 --> 02:49:25,685
MATT: There's a little more in store here. We'll
be back here in a minute guys, we'll see you in a sec.

2764
02:49:25,685 --> 03:00:39,998
[break]

2765
03:00:39,998 --> 03:00:44,731
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome back. We have
returned from our break. Real fast, we had two

2766
03:00:44,731 --> 03:00:49,336
winners. We had one winner from last week since we
had no episode, so we did two this time in the

2767
03:00:49,336 --> 03:01:04,103
chat. The winners are Super Gimpo Man, who won a
flamebox elder hero vault from Wyrmwood. And we

2768
03:01:04,103 --> 03:01:08,205
have a second winner, is Southern Dragon 22, won a
purple heart dice box.

2769
03:01:08,205 --> 03:01:13,611
SAM: That's the one that I have.

2770
03:01:13,611 --> 03:01:21,559
MATT: It's that color right there, for one of the
deckboxes. So Super Gimpo Man and Southern Dragon

2771
03:01:21,559 --> 03:01:23,662
22 congratulations, well done.

2772
03:01:23,662 --> 03:01:28,523
MARISHA: It does grant you cock lightning, that's
true. It's like a 5th-level spell.

2773
03:01:28,523 --> 03:01:39,880
MATT: All right, guys, so, the dust of the battle
settling, the plumes of smoke slowly beginning to

2774
03:01:39,880 --> 03:01:45,297
dissipate as the fires burn out from the previous
struggle. The remaining living soldiers begin to

2775
03:01:45,297 --> 03:01:50,843
gather their dead and wounded. And you guys begin
to reconvene as allies towards the broken front

2776
03:01:50,843 --> 03:01:52,732
doors to the outside of Fort Daxio.

2777
03:01:52,732 --> 03:01:54,632
LAURA: I search Xanthas' body.

2778
03:01:54,632 --> 03:01:56,288
MATT: You search his body?

2779
03:01:56,288 --> 03:01:57,396
LAURA: Yeah.

2780
03:01:57,396 --> 03:01:58,718
MATT: All righty.

2781
03:01:58,718 --> 03:02:00,458
SAM: I'll search the giant.

2782
03:02:00,458 --> 03:02:04,533
MARISHA: Can I scavenge from the ember-roc?

2783
03:02:04,533 --> 03:02:07,045
MATT: Sure, if you want to.

2784
03:02:07,045 --> 03:02:09,486
TRAVIS: Could I ask Pike to heal me a little bit,
please?

2785
03:02:09,486 --> 03:02:13,255
ASHLEY: Oh, yeah. Where are you at?

2786
03:02:13,255 --> 03:02:15,574
TRAVIS: Oh, you know, like a two-digit number.

2787
03:02:15,574 --> 03:02:16,956
LIAM: What?

2788
03:02:16,956 --> 03:02:19,540
MATT: How many points do you have, Grog?

2789
03:02:19,540 --> 03:02:20,793
TRAVIS: 25.

2790
03:02:20,793 --> 03:02:22,233
MATT: 25 hitpoints on Grog.

2791
03:02:22,233 --> 03:02:23,542
SAM: I got nine.

2792
03:02:23,542 --> 03:02:25,723
LAURA: Oh no, he asked. Does that mean that
something's going to happen right now?

2793
03:02:25,723 --> 03:02:26,959
MATT: I don't know.

2794
03:02:26,959 --> 03:02:30,194
LAURA: We need to sleep, let's all sleep. Let's go
to sleep right now.

2795
03:02:30,194 --> 03:02:35,091
MATT: Right now? It doesn't work that way. All
right, so as you guys are looting, the giant has

2796
03:02:35,091 --> 03:02:43,169
giant black iron plate mail on, which is very
heavy, it is-- it's going to take a few hands to

2797
03:02:43,169 --> 03:02:44,197
pull off.

2798
03:02:44,197 --> 03:02:45,616
TRAVIS: Not if we tagteam.

2799
03:02:45,616 --> 03:02:48,339
MATT: As well as her great maul, which is also
very large.

2800
03:02:48,339 --> 03:02:49,602
LIAM: Gauche.

2801
03:02:49,602 --> 03:02:52,058
MATT: And about 812 gold pieces.

2802
03:02:52,058 --> 03:02:53,385
LIAM: I'll take those.

2803
03:02:53,385 --> 03:02:56,266
TRAVIS: Like so big that I couldn't even wield
it?

2804
03:02:56,266 --> 03:03:02,445
MATT: You could hold it, but you couldn't wield
it, yes. Sizewise, it's maybe about three feet

2805
03:03:02,445 --> 03:03:08,697
taller than you, from head to pommel. And the
weight of it is unwieldy for your size.

2806
03:03:08,697 --> 03:03:12,710
TRAVIS: 30 points.

2807
03:03:12,710 --> 03:03:15,144
ASHLEY: I heal him 30 points with my last...

2808
03:03:15,144 --> 03:03:23,879
MATT: Okay. You find on Xanthas-- you find 1,098
gold pieces.

2809
03:03:23,879 --> 03:03:25,806
SAM: I'll take that.

2810
03:03:25,806 --> 03:03:32,370
MATT: You find a potion of superior healing that
he didn't have a chance to use. And there appears

2811
03:03:32,370 --> 03:03:35,526
to be a wand that is shattered.

2812
03:03:35,526 --> 03:03:37,727
MARISHA: Take it.

2813
03:03:37,727 --> 03:03:40,095
LAURA: I'm taking it, of course I'm taking it.

2814
03:03:40,095 --> 03:03:47,619
MATT: It looks like it has broken, and there's a
little bit of a burn mark on the wood the wand was

2815
03:03:47,619 --> 03:03:49,026
crafted from.

2816
03:03:49,026 --> 03:03:56,724
LAURA: Okay. I inspect it. It doesn't do anything
when I inspect it.

2817
03:03:56,724 --> 03:03:58,585
MATT: Okay. Make an arcana check.

2818
03:03:58,585 --> 03:03:59,683
LAURA: Okay.

2819
03:03:59,683 --> 03:04:00,987
LIAM: Take a look, Hermione.

2820
03:04:00,987 --> 03:04:03,114
LAURA: But I'm doing it because Grog told me to,
and he's brilliant.

2821
03:04:03,114 --> 03:04:04,498
TRAVIS: I know.

2822
03:04:04,498 --> 03:04:06,915
LAURA: 11.

2823
03:04:06,915 --> 03:04:09,310
LIAM: Check out the brain on Vex.

2824
03:04:09,310 --> 03:04:11,416
MATT: Definitely busted. And it was once a wand.

2825
03:04:11,416 --> 03:04:12,745
LAURA: Cool cool cool.

2826
03:04:12,745 --> 03:04:14,479
TRAVIS: Are you sure it's not a twig?

2827
03:04:14,479 --> 03:04:20,817
MATT: I hate you so much, Sam. Nothing, continue.

2828
03:04:20,817 --> 03:04:25,220
TRAVIS: He never saw the bottom of it. Until now.

2829
03:04:25,220 --> 03:04:26,486
MATT: No, not until now.

2830
03:04:26,486 --> 03:04:27,705
SAM: Oh, is that true?

2831
03:04:27,705 --> 03:04:30,093
MATT: Yeah. I've been focused on... other things.

2832
03:04:30,093 --> 03:04:44,159
SAM: I printed some extras for you, Matt. Like,
sign them for fans... it's high derp.

2833
03:04:44,159 --> 03:04:53,193
MATT: I blame you, internet. You're partially
responsible for this. Oh boy. Some things never die.

2834
03:04:53,193 --> 03:04:56,580
LIAM: That's a legacy.

2835
03:04:56,580 --> 03:05:02,909
MATT: It is a legacy, it's true. It's pretty
great. One of the downsides of having hundreds of

2836
03:05:02,909 --> 03:05:07,985
hours of video of you on the internet is those are
everywhere.

2837
03:05:07,985 --> 03:05:11,234
LIAM: We've all made awful faces and said stupid
things.

2838
03:05:11,234 --> 03:05:13,438
MATT: It's wonderful. I'm glad you guys have come
to enjoy it.

2839
03:05:13,438 --> 03:05:14,988
MARISHA: They've all seen us pick our noses.

2840
03:05:14,988 --> 03:05:17,062
MATT: Probably, yeah. Somebody do a supercut,
please.

2841
03:05:17,062 --> 03:05:18,694
TALIESIN: Don't.

2842
03:05:18,694 --> 03:05:20,484
MATT: Too late, guys.

2843
03:05:20,484 --> 03:05:24,430
TALIESIN: You're a horrible person. I have two
guns to fix at some point.

2844
03:05:24,430 --> 03:05:26,361
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make some repair checks
while you're working on that.

2845
03:05:26,361 --> 03:05:30,467
TALIESIN: Okay. Do I get a bonus if I'm not in the
middle of combat, or is that still the same

2846
03:05:30,467 --> 03:05:32,040
tinkering check?

2847
03:05:32,040 --> 03:05:33,427
MATT: Same tinkering check.

2848
03:05:33,427 --> 03:05:41,920
TALIESIN: So number one, yes! That goes well,
that's a 17. That was on Animus. And then Bad

2849
03:05:41,920 --> 03:05:45,975
News, which is slightly easier to fix, does not
fix.

2850
03:05:45,975 --> 03:05:47,546
SAM: Bad News.

2851
03:05:47,546 --> 03:05:50,971
TALIESIN: Bad News is broken.

2852
03:05:50,971 --> 03:05:53,394
MATT: Yeah. Bad News, you're going to need
supplies to fix.

2853
03:05:53,394 --> 03:05:55,827
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to need to sit there
with some money and spend some time with it.

2854
03:05:55,827 --> 03:05:57,214
MATT: Okay.

2855
03:05:57,214 --> 03:06:00,511
MARISHA: Hey, Mom? I cleaned the dishes.

2856
03:06:00,511 --> 03:06:03,053
ASHLEY: Did we loot the giant?

2857
03:06:03,053 --> 03:06:07,796
MATT: Yes, the giant was looted. You're trying to
carve something out of the ember-roc?

2858
03:06:07,796 --> 03:06:09,477
MARISHA: Yes I am. Nature check?

2859
03:06:09,477 --> 03:06:11,469
MATT: Go ahead and make a nature check, with
advantage.

2860
03:06:11,469 --> 03:06:15,802
MARISHA: Gil, don't fuck me, Gil. Gil, god damn
it, Gil.

2861
03:06:15,802 --> 03:06:18,888
(laughter)

2862
03:06:18,888 --> 03:06:23,551
MARISHA: But with advantage, it is a 25.

2863
03:06:23,551 --> 03:06:30,989
MATT: Okay. It's hard to pull a lot from the body,
because the nature of the ember-roc, as it passes

2864
03:06:30,989 --> 03:06:36,864
away, parts of it begin to turn to ash, but you do
manage to pull from a portion of its torso what's

2865
03:06:36,864 --> 03:06:44,537
called ember-roc oil. It is a flammable liquid
that burns like a napalm.

2866
03:06:44,537 --> 03:06:46,690
MARISHA: Like napalm?

2867
03:06:46,690 --> 03:06:52,523
MATT: You get about roughly a gallon of it to
extract. Because the rest of it's ruined for it.

2868
03:06:52,523 --> 03:07:01,772
It's worth about 750 gold, if you were to try and
sell it. It's very volatile, depending on how you

2869
03:07:01,772 --> 03:07:03,973
store it, just so you're aware.

2870
03:07:03,973 --> 03:07:08,042
SAM: Cool, man.

2871
03:07:08,042 --> 03:07:10,588
LIAM: Oh man, drop some Mentos in there.

2872
03:07:10,588 --> 03:07:14,712
MARISHA: Percy, do you have any vials left?

2873
03:07:14,712 --> 03:07:17,114
TALIESIN: In theory, I should have some vials
left.

2874
03:07:17,114 --> 03:07:20,253
SAM: Can it hold a gallon?

2875
03:07:20,253 --> 03:07:21,426
TALIESIN: Not a gallon's worth.

2876
03:07:21,426 --> 03:07:27,684
MARISHA: Not a gallon, but I just want a couple,
and I hand a couple to Vex and Vax. Just a couple

2877
03:07:27,684 --> 03:07:29,187
vials of the--

2878
03:07:29,187 --> 03:07:32,620
MATT: So you guys have a vial of ember-roc oil.

2879
03:07:32,620 --> 03:07:34,186
MARISHA: Yep, nitroglycerin.

2880
03:07:34,186 --> 03:07:35,944
MATT: Kind of. In a way.

2881
03:07:35,944 --> 03:07:39,934
MARISHA: You can either make a really great
molotov cocktail, or maybe some flaming arrows.

2882
03:07:39,934 --> 03:07:48,320
MATT: You're not certain. The book that you have
that details some of these creatures, the thing

2883
03:07:48,320 --> 03:07:53,322
that you had found earlier in the campaign, it
doesn't tell you details of how the actual liquid

2884
03:07:53,322 --> 03:07:58,564
is triggered, it just says that it is fiery and
burns very hot.

2885
03:07:58,564 --> 03:08:02,022
TRAVIS: It's like the goo from Ghostbusters 2.
"Talk angry."

2886
03:08:02,022 --> 03:08:03,921
LAURA: "Talk sweet."

2887
03:08:03,921 --> 03:08:12,050
MATT: Sure. As you guys are taking this moment to
figure this out, eventually you hear what sounds

2888
03:08:12,050 --> 03:08:20,129
like the crumbling of stone, and a few rocks
tumble out of the broken open entrance to the

2889
03:08:20,129 --> 03:08:27,120
fortress, and you watch as a couple of guards
begin to come out, their eyes wide. They look like

2890
03:08:27,120 --> 03:08:31,444
they were in armor and ready to make the final
stand. Among them, you see General Elle Gorgofon,

2891
03:08:31,444 --> 03:08:41,031
the female head of this particular regiment of
Fort Daxio, and Kima.

2892
03:08:41,031 --> 03:08:43,548
MARISHA: But what about Allura?

2893
03:08:43,548 --> 03:08:57,131
MATT: You see them all emerge from it. Elle looks
out to them. "So, you've done well. Little late,

2894
03:08:57,131 --> 03:09:08,316
"but thank you for the assist. We'll begin to
gather our dead." She walks forward and gives you

2895
03:09:08,316 --> 03:09:13,183
all a nod as she puts her helmet back on. Puts her
blade aside and begins helping their soldiers

2896
03:09:13,183 --> 03:09:20,739
begin to gather the dead in a pile. Kima steps up.
You can see her teeth are clenched, and there's

2897
03:09:20,739 --> 03:09:25,593
still a shaking of rage in her fists, and what
looks to be streaks of dried tears across her

2898
03:09:25,593 --> 03:09:40,110
cheek. "Xanthas betrayed us all. He arrived alone,
bloodied, asked for aid and protection. Since

2899
03:09:40,110 --> 03:09:46,620
"Allura recognized him, we let him in. Stayed here
for a short time, saying how bad things had become

2900
03:09:46,620 --> 03:09:57,475
"in Emon, and spoke with Allura alone. Something
sensitive. We found her ten minutes later. Come

2901
03:09:57,475 --> 03:09:58,533
"with me."

2902
03:09:58,533 --> 03:10:01,830
TRAVIS: Are you serious?

2903
03:10:01,830 --> 03:10:11,506
MATT: She steps over the stone and leads you
inside of the fortress. She turns the corner,

2904
03:10:11,506 --> 03:10:21,604
stops, staring into the room. As you guys
approach, motions for you to follow her. You walk

2905
03:10:21,604 --> 03:10:25,814
up to one of the small meeting chambers, the one
that you met Elle with when you first arrived

2906
03:10:25,814 --> 03:10:36,609
here. And as you begin to approach, Kima turns
back and says, "It's okay. Friends are here." And

2907
03:10:36,609 --> 03:10:43,295
you walk in and you see Allura sitting really
scared in a corner in her robes, sitting in a

2908
03:10:43,295 --> 03:10:54,275
chair with her knees pulled to her chest. Her eyes
widen as she sees you all, and she gets up from

2909
03:10:54,275 --> 03:10:58,929
her chair and runs over, and the person who's probably
the first to walk in there would probably be

2910
03:10:58,929 --> 03:11:01,572
Keyleth, at this point, and just wraps her arms
around you and just holds you for a second and

2911
03:11:01,572 --> 03:11:02,927
shakes.

2912
03:11:02,927 --> 03:11:07,875
MARISHA: Are you okay? What happened? We thought
you were dead for a second.

2913
03:11:07,875 --> 03:11:11,304
MATT: She backs away. (distressed sounds)

2914
03:11:11,304 --> 03:11:28,201
MARISHA: Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. What's your name?
What's your name? She's been Feebleminded. I turn

2915
03:11:28,201 --> 03:11:33,051
to Kima. Was it Feeblemind?

2916
03:11:33,051 --> 03:11:37,758
MATT: "I-- I don't know what that is, I don't--
Can you help her?"

2917
03:11:37,758 --> 03:11:41,247
MARISHA: Yes. It's a restoration spell.

2918
03:11:41,247 --> 03:11:50,121
ASHLEY: Yeah. I'm going to cast a Greater
Restoration on her. I have it. Can I-- well, I

2919
03:11:50,121 --> 03:11:58,540
don't have any 5th-level left yet-- wow. I don't
have any 5th-level left, but I have a seventh. Can I

2920
03:11:58,540 --> 03:11:59,984
cast it at a seventh?

2921
03:11:59,984 --> 03:12:01,183
MATT: You do have a seventh.

2922
03:12:01,183 --> 03:12:04,033
ASHLEY: Yeah, can I cast it at that?

2923
03:12:04,033 --> 03:12:08,439
MATT: Oh, you can definitely cast it at a higher
level. It doesn't affect it, but you can.

2924
03:12:08,439 --> 03:12:18,082
SAM: No, no, it doesn't affect the power of the
spell. It doesn't make it a more powerful spell.

2925
03:12:18,082 --> 03:12:20,077
ASHLEY: This is so stressful.

2926
03:12:20,077 --> 03:12:26,928
MATT: It's all good. So as you approach-- Kima, as
you begin to walk forward, your hands begin to

2927
03:12:26,928 --> 03:12:34,449
glow as you reach out, your holy symbol beginning
to burn with a bright whitish-orange color that

2928
03:12:34,449 --> 03:12:39,886
mingles with the red and gold of the armor across
your chest. As the glow sparks in your fingers,

2929
03:12:39,886 --> 03:12:41,292
she goes (gasps).

2930
03:12:41,292 --> 03:12:44,176
ASHLEY: It's okay. It's okay. I'm going to help
you.

2931
03:12:44,176 --> 03:12:50,562
MARISHA: I try and calm her as best as I can to
help Pike. Any assistance I can provide.

2932
03:12:50,562 --> 03:12:55,099
MATT: She reaches forward, slowly touches and
grabs your hand, and as it does, you watch as the

2933
03:12:55,099 --> 03:13:03,275
light transfers from your hands and gauntlets into
her arms and upper sleeves. She winces from it,

2934
03:13:03,275 --> 03:13:09,340
but you keep holding her tight, and as it passes
up through, reaches her mind, her face, the glow

2935
03:13:09,340 --> 03:13:15,991
passes through and lifts off her, like this gentle
steam that lifts off her. Eyes roll back for a

2936
03:13:15,991 --> 03:13:20,910
second and close.

2937
03:13:20,910 --> 03:13:22,832
"You are a godsend, my dear."

2938
03:13:22,832 --> 03:13:24,782
ASHLEY: Oh, I grab her and hug her.

2939
03:13:24,782 --> 03:13:28,077
MATT: She pulls you in for a big hug and lifts you
up off the ground for a second before-- "You're

2940
03:13:28,077 --> 03:13:30,350
"heavy now." Puts you back down.

2941
03:13:30,350 --> 03:13:31,878
ASHLEY: I just have so much armor on.

2942
03:13:31,878 --> 03:13:37,640
MATT: "That you do, that you do." As she pulls
back, she looks at you all, and immediately, Grog

2943
03:13:37,640 --> 03:13:42,987
and Vex, you feel yourselves pushed apart, as Kima
rushes up and just grabs her around the side and

2944
03:13:42,987 --> 03:13:49,660
says, "Don't do that again!" Holds her for a
second. Allura just rubs her head and says, "I'm

2945
03:13:49,660 --> 03:13:56,288
"sorry. I should have been careful. We needed
allies, I didn't know--" And Kima says, "You shut

2946
03:13:56,288 --> 03:14:02,530
"up," and she reaches up and gives her a kiss. She
takes her and holds her to her chest. Allura holds

2947
03:14:02,530 --> 03:14:12,237
her, and you hear Kima quietly sobbing for a
moment, and she goes, "I-- well. It seems that

2948
03:14:12,237 --> 03:14:22,321
"things have moved a bit quicker in your absence. I
think it's time to find what we have at our

2949
03:14:22,321 --> 03:14:28,620
"disposal and do what we can to finish this before
it comes on us."

2950
03:14:28,620 --> 03:14:32,266
LAURA: Did you receive any word back from the
armies?

2951
03:14:32,266 --> 03:14:42,153
MATT: "They're about a day south of Emon. Syngorn
has returned. Mikael is leading them northward. I

2952
03:14:42,153 --> 03:14:50,289
"haven't checked in. I'm sorry, I wanted-- I should
have let you know. I couldn't, I didn't--"

2953
03:14:50,289 --> 03:15:00,505
MARISHA: Allura, I'm sorry. We should have been
those allies, here by your side, and we weren't,

2954
03:15:00,505 --> 03:15:02,045
and I'm sorry.

2955
03:15:02,045 --> 03:15:10,190
MATT: "It seems you found what you went for. Let's
hope it makes the difference."

2956
03:15:10,190 --> 03:15:13,548
MARISHA: Yes. It seems it already has.

2957
03:15:13,548 --> 03:15:16,199
LAURA: That's true.

2958
03:15:16,199 --> 03:15:19,719
TALIESIN: We have something else. Where's the
body?

2959
03:15:19,719 --> 03:15:21,485
SAM: What body?

2960
03:15:21,485 --> 03:15:23,979
TALIESIN: We can interrogate him.

2961
03:15:23,979 --> 03:15:25,439
LAURA: Xanthas?

2962
03:15:25,439 --> 03:15:27,462
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, we can!

2963
03:15:27,462 --> 03:15:29,246
MARISHA: I believe he's still on the wall.

2964
03:15:29,246 --> 03:15:31,337
LAURA: Get that fucker!

2965
03:15:31,337 --> 03:15:35,367
TALIESIN: Just because he's dead doesn't mean he
doesn't have to talk to us now.

2966
03:15:35,367 --> 03:15:40,032
TRAVIS: I'll go get him. I'll go get him. I go up
and find the corpse of shitbag and bring it back.

2967
03:15:40,032 --> 03:15:46,716
MATT: At which point, Kima pushes away from
Allura, her head still down. She sniffles back

2968
03:15:46,716 --> 03:15:58,907
tears, looks up, punches her in the shoulder.
Allura bumps back and rubs her shoulder. "I know."

2969
03:15:58,907 --> 03:16:06,122
"You know." Kima turns around and walks out of the
room in a little bit of a huff, her lower lip

2970
03:16:06,122 --> 03:16:15,096
quivering. Allura now smiles for the first time
since you came in. "All right. If you can, do your thing."

2971
03:16:15,096 --> 03:16:16,280
ASHLEY: Okay.

2972
03:16:16,280 --> 03:16:21,554
TRAVIS: Should I put him on the ground or just
hold him? I'll hold him up.

2973
03:16:21,554 --> 03:16:26,334
MATT: So you bring back, dragging this bloody
body, leaving this trail through the Fort. There's

2974
03:16:26,334 --> 03:16:31,060
bits of rock and rubble around, and you're like,
"Oops!" Drag him over them as you go.

2975
03:16:31,060 --> 03:16:34,523
TRAVIS: Whoops, sorry, ooh, that's pouring out.

2976
03:16:34,523 --> 03:16:42,632
MATT: All right. So that is a 3rd-level spell.

2977
03:16:42,632 --> 03:16:46,892
ASHLEY: Because of the necklace, I have one
3rd-level spell left. Because I've used three.

2978
03:16:46,892 --> 03:16:53,589
MATT: Okay. So this would be the one. If you had
it prepared, it has to be prepared. All righty.

2979
03:16:53,589 --> 03:16:54,762
Great.

2980
03:16:54,762 --> 03:16:56,421
SAM: What are we asking this guy?

2981
03:16:56,421 --> 03:16:58,233
TRAVIS: How many questions do we get?

2982
03:16:58,233 --> 03:17:00,759
LAURA: We get three questions.

2983
03:17:00,759 --> 03:17:02,412
SAM: What are we asking?

2984
03:17:02,412 --> 03:17:04,071
MATT: Can ask the corpse up to five questions.

2985
03:17:04,071 --> 03:17:09,822
LAURA: Why are you such a dick?

2986
03:17:09,822 --> 03:17:13,215
MARISHA: You were always mean to us. Why?

2987
03:17:13,215 --> 03:17:16,778
TRAVIS: You've been working with Thordak. What are
his weaknesses?

2988
03:17:16,778 --> 03:17:19,628
MARISHA: What did he want?

2989
03:17:19,628 --> 03:17:22,253
TALIESIN: The defenses of the city.

2990
03:17:22,253 --> 03:17:30,788
MATT: Just be aware of the rule, too. The corpse
is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer

2991
03:17:30,788 --> 03:17:33,436
if you are hostile to it and it recognizes you as
an enemy.

2992
03:17:33,436 --> 03:17:36,416
ASHLEY: So maybe just face it towards me?

2993
03:17:36,416 --> 03:17:37,862
LAURA: Yeah, 'cause you're nice.

2994
03:17:37,862 --> 03:17:43,796
MATT: You can also discern lies, if you get a high
enough insight. This is still-- this isn't free

2995
03:17:43,796 --> 03:17:45,561
answers. This is still an interrogation.

2996
03:17:45,561 --> 03:17:48,569
TRAVIS: What if we put a bag over his head?

2997
03:17:48,569 --> 03:17:50,476
LAURA: I don't know.

2998
03:17:50,476 --> 03:17:53,409
SAM: Who would he trust?

2999
03:17:53,409 --> 03:17:57,162
LIAM: Lizard-skinned man.

3000
03:17:57,162 --> 03:17:59,508
LAURA: Oh yeah. Could you make yourself look like
a lizardman?

3001
03:17:59,508 --> 03:18:04,344
SAM: Yeah, sure, or I could make someone who we
know talk--

3002
03:18:04,344 --> 03:18:06,245
LIAM: But you're so good with words.

3003
03:18:06,245 --> 03:18:12,804
SAM: No, but I mean, I'm saying-- who would he
trust? I can make that person, and I can make that

3004
03:18:12,804 --> 03:18:13,715
person talk.

3005
03:18:13,715 --> 03:18:16,530
MATT: Well, technically, it's Pike asking the
questions, since it is her spell, so whatever

3006
03:18:16,530 --> 03:18:18,538
questions you ask have to go through her.

3007
03:18:18,538 --> 03:18:23,033
MARISHA: We have the Hat of Disguise. Can you give
her the Hat of Disguise?

3008
03:18:23,033 --> 03:18:26,753
TRAVIS: What if you made yourself one of the
lizardpeople, and then you had her down and you

3009
03:18:26,753 --> 03:18:30,106
were using her to get info for Thordak?

3010
03:18:30,106 --> 03:18:32,270
TALIESIN: I think he'll know that he's dead.

3011
03:18:32,270 --> 03:18:34,514
MARISHA: You think he won't care?

3012
03:18:34,514 --> 03:18:35,799
MATT: Yeah.

3013
03:18:35,799 --> 03:18:42,783
TALIESIN: So the trickery, I think it may be-- I
would say it's probably either an appeal or a

3014
03:18:42,783 --> 03:18:43,861
threat.

3015
03:18:43,861 --> 03:18:45,492
LAURA: Let's try the appeal.

3016
03:18:45,492 --> 03:18:48,509
SAM: Let's build a game show set. He'll think he's
on a Japanese game show.

3017
03:18:48,509 --> 03:18:50,088
(laughter)

3018
03:18:50,088 --> 03:18:51,902
MARISHA: Wipeout!

3019
03:18:51,902 --> 03:18:53,976
LAURA: Let's try to make him like us.

3020
03:18:53,976 --> 03:18:57,761
ASHLEY: Let's try to make him like us. Like we
were a friend, we're sad that he died.

3021
03:18:57,761 --> 03:19:02,145
LAURA: Yeah, we'll all back out of view.
Especially me.

3022
03:19:02,145 --> 03:19:05,393
ASHLEY: God, okay.

3023
03:19:05,393 --> 03:19:11,131
SAM: Do we know anything about his family? Because
we could always play bad cop, too, and threaten

3024
03:19:11,131 --> 03:19:12,321
his family.

3025
03:19:12,321 --> 03:19:16,993
MATT: You guys have not engaged him beyond a brief
fuck-you-type conversation in and out.

3026
03:19:16,993 --> 03:19:27,472
TALIESIN: I can threaten him. I can threaten him.
I will threaten him if necessary, but we can try

3027
03:19:27,472 --> 03:19:30,416
the carrot before the stick.

3028
03:19:30,416 --> 03:19:38,776
SAM: All right, so what are we asking? What are
his weaknesses? Has Thordak had a visit from

3029
03:19:38,776 --> 03:19:41,511
Greenie? Raishan?

3030
03:19:41,511 --> 03:19:43,401
TALIESIN: How did they find out where we were?

3031
03:19:43,401 --> 03:19:46,261
TRAVIS: Are there secret entrances into Emon?

3032
03:19:46,261 --> 03:19:47,619
LAURA: Yeah, that's a good one!

3033
03:19:47,619 --> 03:19:51,273
TALIESIN: What are the strengths of their army?
What are their weaknesses?

3034
03:19:51,273 --> 03:19:52,896
MARISHA: What does Thordak ultimately want?

3035
03:19:52,896 --> 03:20:03,175
LAURA: Who does Thordak trust the most?

3036
03:20:03,175 --> 03:20:06,904
TALIESIN: Who in the city, especially.

3037
03:20:06,904 --> 03:20:08,487
LAURA: Yeah, who in the city does Thordak trust?

3038
03:20:08,487 --> 03:20:13,864
LIAM: Do we want to ask him what he knows about
the Clasp's activity?

3039
03:20:13,864 --> 03:20:17,599
SAM: We're up to 20 questions, now?

3040
03:20:17,599 --> 03:20:19,397
LAURA: Four, we've got four!

3041
03:20:19,397 --> 03:20:22,113
TALIESIN: Also, other questions may lead to other
questions.

3042
03:20:22,113 --> 03:20:26,329
LAURA: Okay, so that's good. Let's start with
this, and then we'll see where it goes.

3043
03:20:26,329 --> 03:20:29,314
MATT: All right, what are you doing? Casting the
spell?

3044
03:20:29,314 --> 03:20:30,238
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3045
03:20:30,238 --> 03:20:36,816
MATT: All right, so as Grog throws it on the
ground, skids for a second, you begin casting the

3046
03:20:36,816 --> 03:20:41,671
spell. As you're casting it, Kima walks up and
kicks it one more time and then walks away. You

3047
03:20:41,671 --> 03:20:48,764
finish-- it takes you-- it's a very quick action,
but as you finish, you watch as the air itself

3048
03:20:48,764 --> 03:20:55,333
seems to form this mist around the corpse, and the
mist absorbs into the body. All of a sudden the

3049
03:20:55,333 --> 03:21:02,217
jaw opens. Air fills its chest and the head leans
up, the eyes still staring off into the distance,

3050
03:21:02,217 --> 03:21:04,845
but it seems to be addressing you, Pike.

3051
03:21:04,845 --> 03:21:13,175
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'm going to walk over to him,
and I'm going to put my hand on his face, and I'm

3052
03:21:13,175 --> 03:21:22,743
going to say, my friend, I am so sorry that you've
fallen in battle, but I had to bring you back to

3053
03:21:22,743 --> 03:21:33,972
ask you some questions. I just got so nervous.

3054
03:21:33,972 --> 03:21:36,615
(laughter)

3055
03:21:36,615 --> 03:21:38,970
LIAM: Where's the beef?

3056
03:21:38,970 --> 03:21:55,071
ASHLEY: So we know that you've been working with
Thordak and I have some questions. Has Thordak had

3057
03:21:55,071 --> 03:21:57,409
a visit from Raishan?

3058
03:21:57,409 --> 03:22:00,069
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

3059
03:22:00,069 --> 03:22:09,375
SAM: (quietly) Persuasion check!

3060
03:22:09,375 --> 03:22:12,702
ASHLEY: 22.

3061
03:22:12,702 --> 03:22:21,535
MATT: The head creaks a little bit as it tilts
upward. You can hear the unnatural puppeteering of

3062
03:22:21,535 --> 03:22:34,257
the body trying to speak, not the spirit but the
body's memory. "He's had no visits. He speaks

3063
03:22:34,257 --> 03:22:37,646
"through his crystals."

3064
03:22:37,646 --> 03:22:41,424
MARISHA: Okay, we knew that.

3065
03:22:41,424 --> 03:22:48,323
TALIESIN: (quietly) How did they find out where we
were? How did he find Fort Daxio?

3066
03:22:48,323 --> 03:22:50,233
MARISHA: Well he speaks to his crystals.

3067
03:22:50,233 --> 03:22:51,748
TALIESIN: But we don't know, like--

3068
03:22:51,748 --> 03:22:53,888
MARISHA: Well, some dickhead ratted us out.

3069
03:22:53,888 --> 03:22:55,136
TALIESIN: Who?

3070
03:22:55,136 --> 03:23:00,179
ASHLEY: I just have a couple, or four more
questions for you?

3071
03:23:00,179 --> 03:23:02,111
(laughter)

3072
03:23:02,111 --> 03:23:11,104
ASHLEY: And then I will let you go in peace. How
did you know that we were at Fort Daxio?

3073
03:23:11,104 --> 03:23:28,523
MATT: "Naught but two days before, maybe less, a
scouting party left Emon. Saw activity at the

3074
03:23:28,523 --> 03:23:38,061
"fort. And when they checked, they saw you. And you
were marked."

3075
03:23:38,061 --> 03:23:43,485
TRAVIS: Can you insight check a dead person?

3076
03:23:43,485 --> 03:23:45,270
LAURA: Yeah, can we insight check him?

3077
03:23:45,270 --> 03:23:46,534
MATT: Sure.

3078
03:23:46,534 --> 03:23:49,725
MARISHA: Vox Machina, I'm assuming, considering
you left our--

3079
03:23:49,725 --> 03:23:52,803
MATT: You get the sense that might be what he's
referring to, and you get the sense that long ago

3080
03:23:52,803 --> 03:23:57,903
when you guys were high up on the broom looking
out towards Emon, you missed seeing something that

3081
03:23:57,903 --> 03:23:59,443
was possibly--

3082
03:23:59,443 --> 03:24:05,673
LAURA: I remember that, we didn't roll high enough
on perception. I rolled a 24 on insight.

3083
03:24:05,673 --> 03:24:13,476
MATT: Okay. So far none of the questions seem to
be probing too deeply and he seems to be on the

3084
03:24:13,476 --> 03:24:16,004
level with Pike.

3085
03:24:16,004 --> 03:24:22,489
ASHLEY: Do you know of any secret entrances into
Emon?

3086
03:24:22,489 --> 03:24:31,634
MATT: "Secrets. Just the Traverse Junction."

3087
03:24:31,634 --> 03:24:34,711
SAM: Traverse Junction. We've heard of that
before.

3088
03:24:34,711 --> 03:24:35,741
MARISHA: Yeah, we have.

3089
03:24:35,741 --> 03:24:37,516
MATT: That's where he used to work. That's the--

3090
03:24:37,516 --> 03:24:39,163
TRAVIS: The teleportation circle.

3091
03:24:39,163 --> 03:24:48,568
MATT: "Or the tunnels beneath. But those are where
the Clasp reign dominion."

3092
03:24:48,568 --> 03:24:54,256
TRAVIS: Two more.

3093
03:24:54,256 --> 03:24:59,792
TALIESIN: Who within the city still fights-- who
within the city still fights against the dragon?

3094
03:24:59,792 --> 03:25:02,531
Who will be our allies, who can we trust?

3095
03:25:02,531 --> 03:25:06,503
LAURA: That's a whole lot. Who within the city
fights against Thordak?

3096
03:25:06,503 --> 03:25:10,116
ASHLEY: Are we looking for allies, like who
doesn't--

3097
03:25:10,116 --> 03:25:14,549
SAM: Well we want to know who Thordak trusts and
we want to know who Thordak doesn't--

3098
03:25:14,549 --> 03:25:18,072
LAURA: We've only got two questions left.

3099
03:25:18,072 --> 03:25:20,219
TALIESIN: Thordak doesn't trust anybody.

3100
03:25:20,219 --> 03:25:23,272
MARISHA: Well, the Clasp is clearly working for
him now.

3101
03:25:23,272 --> 03:25:24,495
LAURA: What?

3102
03:25:24,495 --> 03:25:25,990
LAURA and TALIESIN: No.

3103
03:25:25,990 --> 03:25:30,227
MARISHA: Well he said the tunnels the Clasp
"reigns dominion," so--

3104
03:25:30,227 --> 03:25:32,609
TALIESIN: That's where they-- that's theirs.

3105
03:25:32,609 --> 03:25:40,581
LIAM: But they might still be resisting. I mean
the question-- asking this shithead who still

3106
03:25:40,581 --> 03:25:43,252
resists within the city will answer a lot of
questions.

3107
03:25:43,252 --> 03:25:45,111
LAURA: Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah. Ask that.

3108
03:25:45,111 --> 03:25:52,477
ASHLEY: Who still in the city resists-- I have one
job! I feel so--

3109
03:25:52,477 --> 03:25:54,274
(laughter)

3110
03:25:54,274 --> 03:25:56,020
LIAM: Can you understand a word coming out of my
mouth?

3111
03:25:56,020 --> 03:26:02,654
ASHLEY: Computer! Who still in the city resists
Thordak?

3112
03:26:02,654 --> 03:26:23,968
MATT: "There are a few groups. But beneath the
city the resistance builds. We've tried to smoke

3113
03:26:23,968 --> 03:26:27,764
"them out but they keep moving."

3114
03:26:27,764 --> 03:26:33,677
LAURA: (whispers) So the Clasp is still
resisting.

3115
03:26:33,677 --> 03:26:35,224
LIAM: Could be.

3116
03:26:35,224 --> 03:26:36,955
LAURA: Can I insight check him?

3117
03:26:36,955 --> 03:26:39,031
MATT: Sure.

3118
03:26:39,031 --> 03:26:45,317
LAURA: 18.

3119
03:26:45,317 --> 03:26:50,902
MATT: Kind of hard to read for a dead body, but
seems to be legit.

3120
03:26:50,902 --> 03:26:52,724
LAURA: On the up and up?

3121
03:26:52,724 --> 03:26:56,328
ASHLEY: We have one more question, but is there
anything else?

3122
03:26:56,328 --> 03:26:58,696
SAM: Anything else? Allies?

3123
03:26:58,696 --> 03:27:00,369
LAURA: Like, who does Thordak trust the most?

3124
03:27:00,369 --> 03:27:02,027
TALIESIN: Or what does Thordak fear?

3125
03:27:02,027 --> 03:27:03,628
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. I like that one.

3126
03:27:03,628 --> 03:27:09,463
LIAM: Probably, probably. What about Greyskull
Keep? Because there was a tunnel from Greyskull

3127
03:27:09,463 --> 03:27:11,034
Keep into the city.

3128
03:27:11,034 --> 03:27:13,573
TALIESIN and ASHLEY: He might not know about
that.

3129
03:27:13,573 --> 03:27:26,030
ASHLEY: Is there anything or anyone that Thordak
fears the most?

3130
03:27:26,030 --> 03:27:34,693
MATT: "Thordak has no fear. Thordak rules all."

3131
03:27:34,693 --> 03:27:38,381
LIAM and TRAVIS: Insight check.

3132
03:27:38,381 --> 03:27:39,989
TRAVIS: One.

3133
03:27:39,989 --> 03:27:41,481
(laughter)

3134
03:27:41,481 --> 03:27:42,692
LIAM: Two.

3135
03:27:42,692 --> 03:27:43,957
LAURA: Wait wait wait.

3136
03:27:43,957 --> 03:27:49,380
MATT: You can't all make insight checks to cover
for the last person failing.

3137
03:27:49,380 --> 03:27:50,486
TALIESIN: Four.

3138
03:27:50,486 --> 03:27:52,104
LAURA: No, but I've been insight checking the
whole damn time.

3139
03:27:52,104 --> 03:27:53,263
MATT: I know, I know.

3140
03:27:53,263 --> 03:27:55,265
LIAM: But I get plus two so it's actually four,
Matt, so spill his secrets.

3141
03:27:55,265 --> 03:27:56,368
LAURA: 25.

3142
03:27:56,368 --> 03:28:02,398
MATT: 25. Seems to be telling the truth from what
he knows. You get the sense that in a strange way,

3143
03:28:02,398 --> 03:28:09,135
while he was an intelligent fellow, he was also
kind of a sniveling patsy. And the way that Kima's

3144
03:28:09,135 --> 03:28:18,649
talked off the cuff since this began to happen,
since you began to prepare for the corpse, she

3145
03:28:18,649 --> 03:28:24,420
seems to have a history, or at least her and
Allura both have a history with him in the city,

3146
03:28:24,420 --> 03:28:28,414
and he was basically a spineless coward.

3147
03:28:28,414 --> 03:28:35,379
MARISHA: Well, I mean, it makes sense, to a
certain point. When you have a big enough ego you

3148
03:28:35,379 --> 03:28:37,550
don't have any more fears, I guess.

3149
03:28:37,550 --> 03:28:39,276
LIAM: Are we done with him?

3150
03:28:39,276 --> 03:28:40,439
LAURA: That's it.

3151
03:28:40,439 --> 03:28:42,846
SAM: I don't think he's going to talk anymore. We
should kill him.

3152
03:28:42,846 --> 03:28:49,166
MATT: The spell at this point has subsided and the
last bit of energy and mist that had entered the

3153
03:28:49,166 --> 03:28:54,923
body slowly drifts out of the open mouth and nose,
(gasps), and the corpse goes cold.

3154
03:28:54,923 --> 03:29:00,288
LIAM: You guys can fill me in, in a bit. And I
grab his collar and drag him outside with the rest

3155
03:29:00,288 --> 03:29:03,979
of the bodies and start overseeing the burning of
the bodies.

3156
03:29:03,979 --> 03:29:09,300
MATT: Okay. And there are large pyres for a lot of
the lizardmen corpses and wyvern pieces, they've

3157
03:29:09,300 --> 03:29:15,683
all been thrown. All the rest of the dead soldiers
have been rounded up and have blankets and cloth,

3158
03:29:15,683 --> 03:29:19,344
whatever's nearby, to haul them over the wall and
begin to recount who fell among them.

3159
03:29:19,344 --> 03:29:24,564
LAURA: (gasps) Can I fly up in the air and see if
I can spot the boys?

3160
03:29:24,564 --> 03:29:29,927
TALIESIN: We have the stone, you can find the boys
with the stone. If you would like to use the stone

3161
03:29:29,927 --> 03:29:31,137
to pick up the boys--

3162
03:29:31,137 --> 03:29:33,567
MARISHA: Here. I give the stone to Vex.

3163
03:29:33,567 --> 03:29:43,048
MATT: Okay. You concentrate on the stone for a
minute. Your form begins to shift. Your

3164
03:29:43,093 --> 03:29:49,496
physicality begins to almost liquefy and then
swirls and vanishes from view. You open your eyes,

3165
03:29:49,496 --> 03:29:55,431
and you're in shadow. You're in shade. You're in
this little nook at the side of the rock crevasse,

3166
03:29:55,431 --> 03:29:59,432
and you hear two voices go (surprised gasp). And
you look immediately to your left and you see

3167
03:29:59,432 --> 03:30:04,541
Hunin and Kyor are both there. One of them has
dropped the crystal on the ground--

3168
03:30:04,541 --> 03:30:05,917
LAURA: Don't drop it!

3169
03:30:05,917 --> 03:30:07,209
MATT: "Sorry! Sorry!"

3170
03:30:07,209 --> 03:30:08,308
LAURA: No, no. That's okay.

3171
03:30:08,308 --> 03:30:10,249
MATT: "It started glowing and I got scared."

3172
03:30:10,249 --> 03:30:14,044
LAURA: I put it in my pocket. I'm just so glad
you're safe.

3173
03:30:14,044 --> 03:30:16,401
MATT: "I'm glad you're safe too. Is everything
okay?"

3174
03:30:16,401 --> 03:30:23,068
LAURA: Everything is wonderful. Do you want to
come back to the fort? All the bad guys are dead.

3175
03:30:23,068 --> 03:30:31,204
MATT: They both look at each other. "Okay." And
Hunin takes Kyor by the hand and they both walk

3176
03:30:31,204 --> 03:30:34,006
after you as you make your way back towards Fort
Daxio.

3177
03:30:34,006 --> 03:30:36,137
LAURA: Okay.

3178
03:30:36,137 --> 03:30:37,307
MATT: The rest of you--

3179
03:30:37,307 --> 03:30:39,765
LAURA: I bamf Trinket out and let them ride on
Trinket.

3180
03:30:39,765 --> 03:30:44,198
MATT: Okay! They both climb up after an awkward
five minutes of trying to convince them that it's

3181
03:30:44,198 --> 03:30:49,666
okay. Trinket nudges them a little bit and they
get up on top.

3182
03:30:49,666 --> 03:30:52,251
LAURA: He's got a taste for the celestial blood.

3183
03:30:52,251 --> 03:30:56,336
MATT: They're both riding on top of him and he's
proudly walking. (bear grunts)

3184
03:30:56,336 --> 03:30:58,162
LAURA: Yeah.

3185
03:30:58,162 --> 03:31:00,316
TRAVIS: Babysitter Trinket.

3186
03:31:00,316 --> 03:31:07,373
TALIESIN: I say we sleep here for the evening. We
also can go through whatever materials the

3187
03:31:07,373 --> 03:31:14,250
invading army left behind. Cannibalize them for
our own. I suppose we can eat.

3188
03:31:14,250 --> 03:31:16,329
MARISHA: I talk to Allura, I guess.

3189
03:31:16,329 --> 03:31:17,743
MATT: Okay.

3190
03:31:17,743 --> 03:31:19,316
MARISHA: Is she there?

3191
03:31:19,316 --> 03:31:24,247
MATT: Yeah, she's nearby. She was helping gather
the dead, and she was talking with General Elle

3192
03:31:24,247 --> 03:31:34,304
and getting the ideas of what the next course of
action is and as you approach her she turns to you

3193
03:31:34,304 --> 03:31:40,447
and as she recognizes your approach and goes,
"Looking to probably make a jaunt to Whitestone

3194
03:31:40,447 --> 03:31:49,596
"shortly and see what we've gathered on that end. I
can bring everyone with me if you'd like. You can

3195
03:31:49,596 --> 03:31:52,394
"stay here if you like, but..."

3196
03:31:52,394 --> 03:31:55,492
SAM: We should not leave them again.

3197
03:31:55,492 --> 03:32:02,949
MARISHA: I would feel terrible leaving everyone
again after we gathered everyone. Who cast that

3198
03:32:02,949 --> 03:32:08,294
spell on you? Feeblemind, that's very high level
magic.

3199
03:32:08,294 --> 03:32:19,047
MATT: "It is, and it was beyond the capability of
that... man. But he pulled out a small wooden

3200
03:32:19,047 --> 03:32:23,040
"trinket in front of me which shattered and sent me
into my stupor."

3201
03:32:23,040 --> 03:32:25,047
MARISHA: It was Xanthas?

3202
03:32:25,047 --> 03:32:26,147
MATT: "Yes."

3203
03:32:26,147 --> 03:32:28,397
SAM and LAURA: He had that wand that shattered.

3204
03:32:28,397 --> 03:32:30,754
MARISHA: Ah.

3205
03:32:30,754 --> 03:32:34,123
SAM: Did anyone escape the fight to go report back
to home?

3206
03:32:34,123 --> 03:32:38,091
LAURA: There were a couple wyverns that got away.
That's why I don't know if it-- whatever.

3207
03:32:38,091 --> 03:32:40,248
SAM: So does the plan stay the same?

3208
03:32:40,248 --> 03:32:45,589
TRAVIS: I mean we can come back and stage here but
we can't leave anybody here.

3209
03:32:45,589 --> 03:32:47,712
LAURA: Say that again?

3210
03:32:47,712 --> 03:32:49,355
TRAVIS: We can stage here, but we can't leave
anybody here.

3211
03:32:49,355 --> 03:32:52,543
TALIESIN: No, we can't leave anybody here. But
it's interesting. If we're lucky, he's going to

3212
03:32:52,543 --> 03:32:57,054
send more troops to attack and we can be long gone
by then.

3213
03:32:57,054 --> 03:33:01,458
MARISHA: Be long gone? What happened to using this
as our base?

3214
03:33:01,458 --> 03:33:03,149
LAURA: They know about it!

3215
03:33:03,149 --> 03:33:05,990
TRAVIS: We can stage here. We can rally here. We
can't leave anybody here now.

3216
03:33:05,990 --> 03:33:12,759
TALIESIN: We can't leave anybody here. We either
abandon or we rally at this point. And now that we

3217
03:33:12,759 --> 03:33:19,312
know there are forces underneath Emon, that is
good news. That is very good news.

3218
03:33:19,312 --> 03:33:26,065
MARISHA: Was it only the wyverns and the lizardmen
that attacked?

3219
03:33:26,065 --> 03:33:33,820
MATT: "Initially. It seemed to be some sort of a
shock force. Apparently, that fire giant was their

3220
03:33:33,820 --> 03:33:43,572
"reinforcements or a general, I know not. From what
you've told me, at the very least. There weren't

3221
03:33:43,572 --> 03:33:51,820
"any powerful entities here at the get go, either.
I don't think it was sent as a full-scale assault

3222
03:33:51,820 --> 03:33:59,775
"more than it was, at this stage, just enough to
harry and see what was here."

3223
03:33:59,775 --> 03:34:05,625
MARISHA: Who was in contact with Xanthras?
Xanthras? Xanthas? Xanthas. Who was in contact

3224
03:34:05,625 --> 03:34:06,705
with Xanthas?

3225
03:34:06,705 --> 03:34:07,763
TRAVIS: Oh my lord.

3226
03:34:07,763 --> 03:34:08,608
SAM: Zenith.

3227
03:34:08,608 --> 03:34:11,236
MARISHA: Zenith. Who was in contact with Xena the
Warrior Princess?

3228
03:34:11,236 --> 03:34:18,142
MATT: Xanthas. "None of us were in contact with
him. I hadn't seen him, probably in the better

3229
03:34:18,142 --> 03:34:20,890
part of a year."

3230
03:34:20,890 --> 03:34:22,323
MARISHA: Then how did he know?

3231
03:34:22,323 --> 03:34:24,669
TALIESIN: They saw us.

3232
03:34:24,669 --> 03:34:26,957
SAM: They said the scouts spotted us.

3233
03:34:26,957 --> 03:34:29,799
LAURA: Yeah. They spotted us with scouts.

3234
03:34:29,799 --> 03:34:34,154
TRAVIS: You had your hood up, it's okay.

3235
03:34:34,154 --> 03:34:40,664
LIAM: What of the elves? Did I hear correctly that
Syngorn has sent forces?

3236
03:34:40,664 --> 03:34:45,481
MATT: "As far as I know and the information I have
received from Syngorn, they've taken the rest of

3237
03:34:45,481 --> 03:34:52,101
"the troops under General Mikael Daxio as well as
the forces of Syngorn and they're marching towards

3238
03:34:52,101 --> 03:34:53,907
"Emon, one day out."

3239
03:34:53,907 --> 03:34:55,090
LIAM: One day out.

3240
03:34:55,090 --> 03:34:56,525
LAURA: (groans) Oh my god.

3241
03:34:56,525 --> 03:34:59,555
TALIESIN: We could meet them at Emon.

3242
03:34:59,555 --> 03:35:00,624
SAM: Wait, what?

3243
03:35:00,624 --> 03:35:02,633
TALIESIN: They're marching towards Emon.

3244
03:35:02,633 --> 03:35:04,155
SAM: No. Wait, what?

3245
03:35:04,155 --> 03:35:07,314
LAURA: Yeah. So they're a day away.

3246
03:35:07,314 --> 03:35:09,300
SAM: Is that true?

3247
03:35:09,300 --> 03:35:11,378
MATT: "They're making their way northward, towards
Daxio."

3248
03:35:11,378 --> 03:35:12,952
SAM: Yeah, to us.

3249
03:35:12,952 --> 03:35:14,469
MARISHA: Oh, to Daxio.

3250
03:35:14,469 --> 03:35:22,146
MATT: "They're a day out from Emon, but they have
to-- it's in the pathway."

3251
03:35:22,146 --> 03:35:23,893
SAM: That's fine.

3252
03:35:23,893 --> 03:35:25,064
TALIESIN: We want them here.

3253
03:35:25,064 --> 03:35:26,789
MARISHA: That's not okay.

3254
03:35:26,789 --> 03:35:29,302
SAM: Well, where else are we gonna meet?

3255
03:35:29,302 --> 03:35:31,788
MARISHA: Well, if they have to go through the
battleground--

3256
03:35:31,788 --> 03:35:34,641
SAM: They don't have to go through, they can go
around it; they're not idiots.

3257
03:35:34,641 --> 03:35:39,121
MATT: "They will, and in doing so, it's about a
four-day journey on foot for those troops to make

3258
03:35:39,121 --> 03:35:40,544
"it here to Fort Daxio."

3259
03:35:40,544 --> 03:35:42,097
LAURA: Okay. So we have four days.

3260
03:35:42,097 --> 03:35:44,719
TALIESIN: We don't have four days.

3261
03:35:44,719 --> 03:35:50,240
TRAVIS: I would volunteer that we should head
south and meet them where they are.

3262
03:35:50,240 --> 03:35:51,816
SAM: On the outskirts of Emon.

3263
03:35:51,816 --> 03:35:56,057
TRAVIS: Yep. Better than being here, 'cause we let
people get away.

3264
03:35:56,057 --> 03:35:57,513
MARISHA: We're sitting ducks here.

3265
03:35:57,513 --> 03:36:00,153
SAM: So we're gonna march all the troops out of
here.

3266
03:36:00,153 --> 03:36:02,397
LAURA: All the troops, which is like, 20 people
left.

3267
03:36:02,397 --> 03:36:06,154
TRAVIS: You gotta reposition once you give your
position away.

3268
03:36:06,154 --> 03:36:12,997
MATT: As you as that, Elle pulls forward, her
helmet under her arm. "Last count, looks like we

3269
03:36:12,997 --> 03:36:16,855
"have 55 strong surviving."

3270
03:36:16,855 --> 03:36:18,661
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're gonna march all 55.

3271
03:36:18,661 --> 03:36:20,451
MARISHA: Out of 200 that were here?

3272
03:36:20,451 --> 03:36:24,951
SAM: Remember that the original plan
was for Thordak to know where we were, and

3273
03:36:25,080 --> 03:36:27,564
send Raishan to kill us.

3274
03:36:27,564 --> 03:36:33,627
MARISHA: Where the fuck is Raishan? Where is
Raishan?

3275
03:36:33,627 --> 03:36:38,279
LAURA: Well, we sent Raishan back to Whitestone
with Asum and then we left, so for all we know

3276
03:36:38,279 --> 03:36:40,182
Raishan's there.

3277
03:36:40,182 --> 03:36:42,612
MARISHA: Allura, you were talking about going to
Whitestone.

3278
03:36:42,612 --> 03:36:45,789
MATT: "That was my plan, yes."

3279
03:36:45,789 --> 03:36:48,531
MARISHA: And what were all of your goals, again?

3280
03:36:48,531 --> 03:36:49,991
SAM: All of your goals?

3281
03:36:49,991 --> 03:36:51,951
MARISHA: All of Allura's goals.

3282
03:36:51,951 --> 03:36:52,865
MARISHA: What did you want to do in Whitestone?

3283
03:36:52,865 --> 03:36:54,684
MATT: "That's a very broad question."

3284
03:36:54,684 --> 03:36:59,922
SAM: We need to meet up with Raishan. We need to
find a rally point.

3285
03:36:59,922 --> 03:37:02,085
ASHLEY: Open a magic cafe.

3286
03:37:02,085 --> 03:37:09,496
TALIESIN: 55 men in a broken citadel is not a
plan. It was a plan before, it's not a plan now.

3287
03:37:09,496 --> 03:37:11,205
These things have to change.

3288
03:37:11,205 --> 03:37:15,467
LIAM: We've an army close to Emon. We do have to
talk to Raishan, though. I think we should go to

3289
03:37:15,467 --> 03:37:21,373
Whitestone immediately, talk to her, and figure
out if there's any news with her.

3290
03:37:21,373 --> 03:37:22,749
SAM: She was coming back there, right?

3291
03:37:22,749 --> 03:37:23,779
TRAVIS: Yeah, is that where she is?

3292
03:37:23,779 --> 03:37:25,100
LAURA: Potentially

3293
03:37:25,100 --> 03:37:30,529
LIAM: But be ready to move to the army from
Syngorn, quickly. It might be our best shot, our

3294
03:37:30,529 --> 03:37:33,207
only shot?

3295
03:37:33,207 --> 03:37:40,418
SAM: Should we march these 55 blokes to the south
while we go to Whitestone? I'll stay and march the

3296
03:37:40,418 --> 03:37:42,187
troops while you guys go back to Whitestone.

3297
03:37:42,187 --> 03:37:43,803
LAURA: No, we need to rest!

3298
03:37:43,803 --> 03:37:46,509
MARISHA: Okay, hang on, hang on. What time of day
is it?

3299
03:37:46,509 --> 03:37:50,291
MATT: At this point it's probably a little later
afternoon; you're maybe an hour, hour and a half

3300
03:37:50,291 --> 03:37:51,677
from sunset.

3301
03:37:51,677 --> 03:38:02,121
MARISHA: All right. We can gather our most elite.

3302
03:38:02,121 --> 03:38:05,021
LAURA: It started really strong.

3303
03:38:05,021 --> 03:38:10,961
MARISHA: I can get a decent amount of people
through if we Teleport Via Plants very quickly,

3304
03:38:10,961 --> 03:38:12,687
but not all of them.

3305
03:38:12,687 --> 03:38:14,050
LAURA: No.

3306
03:38:14,050 --> 03:38:17,356
SAM: I think the 55 will be okay if we send them
off into the wilderness.

3307
03:38:17,356 --> 03:38:26,097
MARISHA: Here's the thing, 55 people walking near
Emon is not very covert. And it's clear that there

3308
03:38:26,097 --> 03:38:33,400
are scouts everywhere; Fort Daxio was off the map
until we showed up. No one was watching it until

3309
03:38:33,400 --> 03:38:35,048
we showed up.

3310
03:38:35,048 --> 03:38:37,148
LIAM: But we are out of time.

3311
03:38:37,148 --> 03:38:41,091
MARISHA: But we are what Thordak is watching.

3312
03:38:41,091 --> 03:38:43,718
TALIESIN: So we have to be very careful of where
we go and what we do.

3313
03:38:43,718 --> 03:38:47,079
MARISHA: We put everyone at risk no matter where
we are.

3314
03:38:47,079 --> 03:38:52,593
SAM: No matter what, there's not gonna be another
attack on Daxio in the next 24 hours. So we can go

3315
03:38:52,593 --> 03:38:57,028
back to Whitestone, we can spend the night here
and then go back, or go back now and spend a night

3316
03:38:57,028 --> 03:39:00,122
and then bamf right back before there's any
attack.

3317
03:39:00,122 --> 03:39:05,368
TALIESIN: Or we can send half the troops, as many
as we can, tonight, stay here, and in the morning

3318
03:39:05,368 --> 03:39:08,174
send the rest, and we can go with them.

3319
03:39:08,174 --> 03:39:10,054
MARISHA: To where Syngorn's army is?

3320
03:39:10,054 --> 03:39:12,605
LAURA: But we're gonna have to bring those guys
back out here, right? I mean, we're gonna have to

3321
03:39:12,605 --> 03:39:19,692
march with the 55 guys. So why send them through
to Whitestone? Why not sleep tonight, deep within

3322
03:39:19,692 --> 03:39:21,534
the fort, wake up in the morning?

3323
03:39:21,534 --> 03:39:23,650
LIAM: They rest up, we go--

3324
03:39:23,650 --> 03:39:27,326
SAM: To Whitestone? Get info, come back tomorrow
if we need to.

3325
03:39:27,326 --> 03:39:29,442
LAURA: Yeah, but we need to rest now.

3326
03:39:29,442 --> 03:39:32,149
TRAVIS: You can't get 55 guys in the mansion,
right?

3327
03:39:32,149 --> 03:39:33,480
SAM: The mansion, sure.

3328
03:39:33,480 --> 03:39:35,525
LIAM: But the mansion can't travel.

3329
03:39:35,525 --> 03:39:39,972
SAM: Unless we spend the night here first before
going to Whitestone bright and early in the morning.

3330
03:39:40,024 --> 03:39:41,378
LAURA: Well, maybe we should do that.

3331
03:39:41,378 --> 03:39:44,389
SAM: We need to rest anyway. I'm at nine hit
points.

3332
03:39:44,389 --> 03:39:46,287
LAURA: Can you use the mansion tonight?

3333
03:39:46,287 --> 03:39:48,658
SAM: No, I can't.

3334
03:39:48,658 --> 03:39:53,970
LAURA: So we sleep within the fort. Deep within
the fort.

3335
03:39:53,970 --> 03:39:55,303
SAM: Yeah.

3336
03:39:55,303 --> 03:39:58,830
MARISHA: What's left of the fort? What's
undestroyed?

3337
03:39:58,830 --> 03:40:02,889
MATT: The fort's actually holding pretty well.
Other than the front doors, which need to be

3338
03:40:02,889 --> 03:40:08,792
repaired, and right now there isn't anything
beyond just putting things in the way because of

3339
03:40:08,792 --> 03:40:13,564
the impact of the giant. The outer wall's taken
quite a bit of damage, but the fortress itself,

3340
03:40:13,564 --> 03:40:15,527
for the most part, is standing.

3341
03:40:15,527 --> 03:40:19,386
SAM: We'll be okay for eight hours of sleep, and
then we can go to Whitestone, ask around, come

3342
03:40:19,386 --> 03:40:21,886
back if we need to. Let's go to sleep.

3343
03:40:21,886 --> 03:40:24,122
MARISHA: Maybe we should have someone on watch.

3344
03:40:24,122 --> 03:40:25,627
TALIESIN: Well, it is a fort.

3345
03:40:25,627 --> 03:40:26,860
LAURA: We'll put the guards on watch.

3346
03:40:26,860 --> 03:40:29,316
TALIESIN: They have a system.

3347
03:40:29,316 --> 03:40:34,333
MATT: General Elle says, "I can do that; don't
worry. And don't make fun of my horns!"

3348
03:40:34,333 --> 03:40:39,062
LAURA: I'm not, I'm not! I'm just saying that's
the sound they'll make if they come.

3349
03:40:39,062 --> 03:40:44,532
MATT: "It's a very specific sound my soldiers are
trained to hear."

3350
03:40:44,532 --> 03:40:47,576
ASHLEY: Of course, if you need us, you do blow
that horn.

3351
03:40:47,576 --> 03:40:48,686
MATT: "Of course."

3352
03:40:48,686 --> 03:40:49,830
ASHLEY: 'Cause we will hear it.

3353
03:40:49,830 --> 03:40:51,194
MATT: "Yes you will."

3354
03:40:51,194 --> 03:40:52,438
TALIESIN: I need to sleep.

3355
03:40:52,438 --> 03:40:56,849
LAURA: Let's find a bedroom and lay the fuck
down.

3356
03:40:56,849 --> 03:40:59,328
MARISHA: Are we sleeping in the fort?

3357
03:40:59,328 --> 03:41:03,919
ASHLEY: Is there a room with a big fireplace in
it, and we can all just have a sleepover?

3358
03:41:03,919 --> 03:41:07,623
MATT: If you want to, there is a hearth in one of
the common-room areas.

3359
03:41:07,623 --> 03:41:10,608
LAURA: Is there somewhere to clean up?

3360
03:41:10,608 --> 03:41:14,548
MATT: They do. There are a few bathrooms that can
be...

3361
03:41:14,548 --> 03:41:19,130
ASHLEY: Are there hides and things, like, fluffies
we can lay on?

3362
03:41:19,130 --> 03:41:23,863
MATT: There's nothing terribly comfortable, but
there are blankets. It does get cold this far

3363
03:41:23,863 --> 03:41:29,833
north. It's not in the winter months anymore, but
just south of the Cliffkeep Mountains in this

3364
03:41:29,833 --> 03:41:34,624
area, it does get kinda chilly, so there are
blankets, there are hides, there are things to

3365
03:41:34,624 --> 03:41:36,033
keep warm in.

3366
03:41:36,033 --> 03:41:39,656
LIAM: I mean, you just got used as a weapon; you
might want a shower.

3367
03:41:39,656 --> 03:41:41,517
ASHLEY: Ah, I like the dirt.

3368
03:41:41,517 --> 03:41:44,608
LAURA: I'm gonna go soak.

3369
03:41:44,608 --> 03:41:48,625
MARISHA: I'm gonna crash as soon as I find
something fluffy to fall on.

3370
03:41:48,625 --> 03:41:53,654
MATT: Okay. All right. The rest of you guys find
yourselves to rest for the evening? Okay. Those

3371
03:41:53,654 --> 03:42:00,291
who care to, you clean up, and find rest as well.
The food is meager but serviceable, and you all

3372
03:42:00,291 --> 03:42:07,899
find yourselves an evening's rest. Unperturbed, a
good nine, ten hours pass of intense sleep as you

3373
03:42:07,899 --> 03:42:14,691
all are sore, you are all exhausted-- although you
do recover your point of exhaustion, Scanlan,

3374
03:42:14,691 --> 03:42:24,178
that's gone-- as do you, from your frenzied rage--
You all come to consciousness shortly after

3375
03:42:24,178 --> 03:42:28,944
daybreak, I'd say; you got to bed probably right
around sunset, or a little bit past sunset, so

3376
03:42:28,944 --> 03:42:39,951
it's just starting to get the sun over the
mountains. The day is yours.

3377
03:42:39,951 --> 03:42:43,031
LIAM: Well, we said what we were gonna do; we're
gonna go to Whitestone.

3378
03:42:43,031 --> 03:42:45,474
LAURA: Then let's fucking go to Whitestone. Yep.
That's what we said we were gonna do.

3379
03:42:45,474 --> 03:42:48,069
LIAM: Kiki, set us up.

3380
03:42:48,069 --> 03:42:50,295
MARISHA: Sure.

3381
03:42:50,295 --> 03:42:52,001
SAM: We have any trees here?

3382
03:42:52,001 --> 03:42:54,438
MARISHA: Yeah.

3383
03:42:54,438 --> 03:42:57,977
MATT: Allura raises her hand. "I can still take us
there."

3384
03:42:57,977 --> 03:42:59,739
LAURA: Fuck, yeah, that's right!

3385
03:42:59,739 --> 03:43:05,119
MATT: "That was the plan, but... I mean, it's up
to you; we could find a tree, I suppose."

3386
03:43:05,119 --> 03:43:10,146
LAURA: Okay, but I have two extra guys with us
right now.

3387
03:43:10,146 --> 03:43:14,518
MATT: "Oh... I cannot do that, unfortunately."

3388
03:43:14,518 --> 03:43:21,340
MARISHA: Okay, you know what? I can get us there,
and Allura can get us back on the same day.

3389
03:43:21,340 --> 03:43:23,385
LAURA: Okay, yeah.

3390
03:43:23,385 --> 03:43:26,372
MARISHA: What are we getting at Whitestone?

3391
03:43:26,372 --> 03:43:27,954
LIAM: We're gonna talk to Raishan.

3392
03:43:27,954 --> 03:43:28,999
LAURA: See if Raishan's there.

3393
03:43:28,999 --> 03:43:29,881
MARISHA: Is Raishan there?

3394
03:43:29,881 --> 03:43:30,988
LAURA: Potentially!

3395
03:43:30,988 --> 03:43:35,535
MATT: "I haven't seen Raishan. We've been at the
fort this entire time, waiting for your return."

3396
03:43:35,535 --> 03:43:39,286
MARISHA: And she was getting Asum. You know what?
Yeah. Let's go. All right!

3397
03:43:39,286 --> 03:43:46,766
MATT: All right. You find your way out to one of
the slightly charred trees in the main courtyard

3398
03:43:46,766 --> 03:43:56,029
area, you open the portal. (whoosh) as it opens,
your two celestial-blooded children guide you

3399
03:43:56,029 --> 03:44:01,844
through, as well as Kima and Allura, into
Whitestone. You emerge from the Sun Tree in the

3400
03:44:01,844 --> 03:44:12,935
morning hours there as well. The city is quiet.
You can see that a lot of the guard has been

3401
03:44:12,935 --> 03:44:19,305
gathering arms and armor just in case they were
ever called to be part of this fray, and the city

3402
03:44:19,305 --> 03:44:24,987
just seems to be on high alert. But everything is
intact, Whitestone appears to be fine, and the

3403
03:44:24,987 --> 03:44:32,102
castle looms northward from your current position.
You guys make your way towards Whitestone Castle;

3404
03:44:32,102 --> 03:44:38,542
the guards greet you and lead you inside. Within
minutes, Cassandra has been summoned down and

3405
03:44:38,542 --> 03:44:42,354
says, "Percival, thank God you've returned."

3406
03:44:42,354 --> 03:44:46,934
TALIESIN: 'Thank God'? All right, why? What's
happened?

3407
03:44:46,934 --> 03:44:48,978
MATT: "You're alive, that's--"

3408
03:44:48,978 --> 03:44:50,185
TALIESIN: Oh! Yes.

3409
03:44:50,185 --> 03:44:54,141
MATT: "Look, the last time you left, you did not
come back in the best of places! I'm just

3410
03:44:54,141 --> 03:44:55,229
"beginning to think--"

3411
03:44:55,229 --> 03:44:58,524
TALIESIN: I just assume that everything is going
to be bad news for the next-- Just assume that I'm

3412
03:44:58,524 --> 03:45:05,268
going to assume everything is terrible every time
I see you for the next two months. Yes, we're alive.

3413
03:45:05,324 --> 03:45:06,534
MATT: "Speaking of Asum."

3414
03:45:06,534 --> 03:45:07,733
TALIESIN: Oh, no.

3415
03:45:07,733 --> 03:45:09,001
MATT: "Come."

3416
03:45:09,001 --> 03:45:16,518
LAURA: Oh, Cassandra, are there rooms for these
new guests?

3417
03:45:16,518 --> 03:45:17,948
MATT: "Who are these?"

3418
03:45:17,948 --> 03:45:23,915
LAURA: They're the sweetest! This is, um... Keurig
and Human.

3419
03:45:23,915 --> 03:45:32,483
(laughter)

3420
03:45:32,483 --> 03:45:36,554
MATT: You're the best foster mom ever!

3421
03:45:36,554 --> 03:45:39,874
LAURA: I have them written down somewhere, but I
can't find it in my notes!

3422
03:45:39,874 --> 03:45:42,764
LIAM: We met them at Booty, they're totally
celestial--

3423
03:45:42,764 --> 03:45:44,369
MARISHA: They're totally great, man!

3424
03:45:44,369 --> 03:45:46,048
SAM: Pumpkin latte...

3425
03:45:46,048 --> 03:45:48,372
MARISHA: They can just crash on our couch for a
few months.

3426
03:45:48,372 --> 03:45:52,302
MATT: You watch their noses scrunch a little as
you entirely butcher their names.

3427
03:45:52,302 --> 03:45:54,386
LIAM: They have, like, angel blood!

3428
03:45:54,386 --> 03:45:57,228
(laughter)

3429
03:45:57,228 --> 03:45:59,245
LAURA: What are their names again? I can't find
it.

3430
03:45:59,245 --> 03:46:01,643
MATT: Hunin and Kyor.

3431
03:46:01,643 --> 03:46:04,020
LAURA: Hunin and... Kyor?

3432
03:46:04,020 --> 03:46:05,632
MATT: Yes. K-Y-O-R.

3433
03:46:05,632 --> 03:46:07,349
LIAM: Do you see all of this?

3434
03:46:07,349 --> 03:46:12,207
LAURA: Got it. Angel babies. Writing it down.

3435
03:46:12,207 --> 03:46:16,162
MATT: "Yes, we can find them a room; that's fine.
Not to worry."

3436
03:46:16,162 --> 03:46:18,186
TALIESIN: We'll put them to work. They will be
useful.

3437
03:46:18,186 --> 03:46:19,151
MATT: "Fine."

3438
03:46:19,151 --> 03:46:26,924
SAM: I mean, not right away. They've been slaves.
Why don't we give them a day off?

3439
03:46:26,924 --> 03:46:29,019
ASHLEY: How old are they?

3440
03:46:29,019 --> 03:46:35,300
MATT: They're in their late teens. Mid- to late
teens.

3441
03:46:35,300 --> 03:46:38,741
SAM: Why don't we just give them some schooling?

3442
03:46:38,741 --> 03:46:41,748
LAURA: I guess they're about the same age as
Cassandra, then, huh?

3443
03:46:41,748 --> 03:46:46,890
MATT: Cassandra's a little bit older. Though she
doesn't act it. She acts, like, fifteen years her

3444
03:46:46,890 --> 03:46:49,537
senior. And always has.

3445
03:46:49,537 --> 03:46:53,975
TALIESIN: Yes. All right. Asum?

3446
03:46:53,975 --> 03:46:58,744
MATT: All right, you guys head upstairs with her;
she leads you-- oh, no. She does not lead you

3447
03:46:58,744 --> 03:47:08,847
upstairs. She leads you downstairs, through the
tunnels, towards the ziggurat. And as she's

3448
03:47:08,847 --> 03:47:17,333
walking along, she says, "Well. We've managed to
relocate the meeting room. And it required a bit

3449
03:47:17,333 --> 03:47:31,007
"of careful discussion as to our current allies. As
well, the transport was a bit awkward for Asum and

3450
03:47:31,007 --> 03:47:43,816
"his companion, and the dragon cannot maintain her
usual form around the ziggurat, so just be ready."

3451
03:47:43,816 --> 03:47:45,674
TALIESIN: I assumed.

3452
03:47:45,674 --> 03:47:50,474
MATT: As you guys make your way into the ziggurat
chamber, you can see already there's the platform

3453
03:47:50,474 --> 03:47:55,069
on the outside of the central area where the new
situation is set. And you see there's a table, and

3454
03:47:55,069 --> 03:47:58,738
you can already hear discussion off that way, and
there are a few servants that are bringing food

3455
03:47:58,738 --> 03:48:02,798
and drinks up there as part of the morning
breakfast for those who are in their meeting. And

3456
03:48:02,798 --> 03:48:08,276
you see there, right on the outskirts of the
table, wrapped and curled up, a gargantuan green

3457
03:48:08,276 --> 03:48:13,919
dragon with its head resting on its claws that is
listening in on part of the conversation.

3458
03:48:13,919 --> 03:48:16,593
LAURA: Oh, damn.

3459
03:48:16,593 --> 03:48:17,866
LIAM: Hey, little guy.

3460
03:48:17,866 --> 03:48:22,036
TALIESIN: Well, things have not been going well on
our end; how about yours?

3461
03:48:22,036 --> 03:48:23,238
MATT: To Cassandra?

3462
03:48:23,238 --> 03:48:25,594
TALIESIN: Well, to the room.

3463
03:48:25,594 --> 03:48:32,717
MATT: To the room? Okay, so as you head up to the
platform, everyone pauses and looks over. Asum

3464
03:48:32,717 --> 03:48:39,443
stands up-- you can see now, this being the real
Asum-- acid-scarred across the face, just as

3465
03:48:39,443 --> 03:48:46,196
Raishan's form arriving was, and sitting on the
opposite end of Raishan, and you can see there's

3466
03:48:46,196 --> 03:48:52,144
this very much kind of-- especially as a master of
spies and information, understands the importance

3467
03:48:52,144 --> 03:48:57,018
of, you know, strange bedfellows, given the
circumstances in war, but is still not at ease and

3468
03:48:57,018 --> 03:49:03,123
doesn't seem to keep-- always has one eye on the
dragon at all times, but gives a nod. "It's good

3469
03:49:03,123 --> 03:49:13,541
"to see that you're all alive. And we have much to
discuss. Please, come sit. You've met Brom

3470
03:49:13,541 --> 03:49:19,234
"before." And you look over and you can see Brom
Goldhand, the same square-jawed, shorter, black

3471
03:49:19,234 --> 03:49:28,758
unkempt hair, the cleric of Ioun that was and is
part of the council. However, the skin is covered

3472
03:49:28,758 --> 03:49:33,779
in burn scars. Like, the face, some of the
features are kind of missing. All the exposed

3473
03:49:33,779 --> 03:49:42,698
elements beyond the armor are just burned. But he
stands and bows to everyone. "It is good to see

3474
03:49:42,698 --> 03:49:51,357
"you all alive." He sits down at the table,
Cassandra takes a seat. Raishan has said nothing,

3475
03:49:51,357 --> 03:50:03,614
is just watching you all as you sit down, gives a
nod. Allura flanks behind you. Kima has been asked

3476
03:50:03,614 --> 03:50:09,872
not to attend. (chuckles) Allura sits down on--
there's a few stools, whatever chairs were

3477
03:50:09,872 --> 03:50:14,979
available were brought in here, so it's a
ramshackle meeting room, given how many butts have

3478
03:50:14,979 --> 03:50:16,642
to sit around this area.

3479
03:50:16,642 --> 03:50:18,194
LAURA: I'll stand.

3480
03:50:18,194 --> 03:50:29,847
MATT: But you are all here. "So. I've been told
that you were at Daxio and gathering other allies

3481
03:50:29,847 --> 03:50:35,533
"about. Please, let us know what the circumstance
is from your end of things. Things are not as well

3482
03:50:35,533 --> 03:50:37,782
"from ours."

3483
03:50:37,782 --> 03:50:39,382
TRAVIS: That sucks to hear.

3484
03:50:39,382 --> 03:50:42,192
TALIESIN: Daxio was discovered and attacked
prematurely.

3485
03:50:42,192 --> 03:50:43,599
MATT: "Wonderful."

3486
03:50:43,599 --> 03:50:51,056
TALIESIN: A group has already-- a small strike
group came and attacked the fort, did damage-- I

3487
03:50:51,056 --> 03:50:53,646
wouldn't necessarily call it significant damage--

3488
03:50:53,646 --> 03:50:56,539
LAURA: But wiped out a large percentage of the
force there.

3489
03:50:56,539 --> 03:50:58,093
TALIESIN: Decimated it.

3490
03:50:58,093 --> 03:51:00,775
TRAVIS: 75 percent.

3491
03:51:00,775 --> 03:51:01,972
LIAM: Grog?

3492
03:51:01,972 --> 03:51:03,494
TRAVIS: I mean, whatever those words mean.

3493
03:51:03,494 --> 03:51:09,848
(laughter)

3494
03:51:09,848 --> 03:51:18,805
TALIESIN: Broken clock. That's a very good guess,
Grog. I've completely lost my train of thought.

3495
03:51:18,805 --> 03:51:21,401
TRAVIS: Approximately.

3496
03:51:21,401 --> 03:51:26,129
MARISHA: The problem is that we've summoned many
of our allies to Fort Daxio and they are currently

3497
03:51:26,129 --> 03:51:29,479
in transit to that current location.

3498
03:51:29,479 --> 03:51:30,981
MATT: "But Daxio's been attacked."

3499
03:51:30,981 --> 03:51:34,005
MARISHA: Correct.

3500
03:51:34,005 --> 03:51:41,491
MATT: "Then I would not recommend taking folks to
Fort Daxio, especially if it's sustained damage.

3501
03:51:41,491 --> 03:51:57,850
"Well, we've been busy in Emon." The eyes glance
over at Raishan. "And, well, needless to say,

3502
03:51:57,850 --> 03:52:03,234
"things have gone a bit strange. We've been working
with Spireling Shenn and the Clasp, and we've been

3503
03:52:03,234 --> 03:52:11,878
"able to smuggle thousands of denizens of Emon
beneath the city. Those that were not directly

3504
03:52:11,878 --> 03:52:19,758
"enslaved or gave fealty to the Cinder King out of
fear and other interests we've been able to keep

3505
03:52:19,758 --> 03:52:27,687
"safe, and we've moved through the tunnels as often
as possible. There are still many, many, <i>many</i>

3506
03:52:27,687 --> 03:52:35,686
"wyvern riders that patrol the city; the townfolk
have run out of offerings and are now being sent

3507
03:52:35,686 --> 03:52:46,378
"out in slave groups to pull goods from nearby
cities to bring at the feet of the dragon. We also

3508
03:52:46,378 --> 03:52:51,406
"have a rising volcanic mass rising up beneath the
city that has consumed a number of the underground

3509
03:52:51,406 --> 03:52:59,381
"Clasp tunnels and has been slowly pinching off our
mobility beneath the town, so our intent to

3510
03:52:59,381 --> 03:53:05,479
"hopefully find some sort of retort or vengeance
and eventually take down the dragon... that clock

3511
03:53:05,479 --> 03:53:15,762
"is definitely ticking. Now. We've been keeping as
best an eye on Thordak as we can. Brom, bless him

3512
03:53:15,762 --> 03:53:20,369
"and his sacrifices, has been our front man for
this. And we know the creature has been shedding

3513
03:53:20,369 --> 03:53:27,132
"scales in places where jets of ever-burning flame
now spark and burn the city itself. Wherever each

3514
03:53:27,132 --> 03:53:35,272
"one of these scales falls, it seems to be a beacon
or source of its own white-hot fire. So the city

3515
03:53:35,272 --> 03:53:50,522
"is now a pitfall of its own right. The creature
itself, the dragon, it has these jets that now

3516
03:53:50,522 --> 03:53:56,473
"burst from underneath its armor, fire that licks
beyond it. It has a crest of red crystals now that

"begin to twist behind its horns and head, its eyes
are like white-hot stars from the sky, it's...

3518
03:54:07,841 --> 03:54:16,438
"It's still dragon-like, but something more primal
and elemental. (sighs) I'm not entirely certain

3519
03:54:16,438 --> 03:54:25,526
"what we're dealing with here. But Brom, you've
made some headway." And Brom clears his throat.

3520
03:54:25,526 --> 03:54:36,205
"(ahem) Myself and a few devout have been doing
our best to prepare surviving warriors and guards,

3521
03:54:36,205 --> 03:54:42,318
"and mages who were ousted from the Lyceum; we have
a few strike teams that have been effective in

3522
03:54:42,318 --> 03:54:49,680
"harrying the outside of his defenses, learning
information we can, knocking down the guardians.

3523
03:54:49,680 --> 03:54:54,152
"Since the fire giants have arrived it's been a
little more difficult, so we've been reduced to

3524
03:54:54,152 --> 03:55:03,784
"stealth missions, quick in and out. We don't have
the muscle to assault head-on. Up until recently."

3525
03:55:03,784 --> 03:55:08,205
His eyes pass over to you. "You say there are
armies making their way to the city, and we have

3526
03:55:08,205 --> 03:55:16,114
"you, all the strength that you've gained and the
stories I've heard from people here at Whitestone.

3527
03:55:16,114 --> 03:55:25,181
"If we're going to do something, we need to do it
soon. Now, the Lyceum has fallen to those that

3528
03:55:25,181 --> 03:55:35,068
"have sworn fealty to the Cinder King, so we don't
have use of those artifacts anymore. We've been

3529
03:55:35,068 --> 03:55:40,543
"trying to break through to the inner sanctum of
the Cloudtop, what the dragon now calls its home,

3530
03:55:40,543 --> 03:55:54,122
"its lair. It's burrowed this deep, underground
basin where it resides now. It only emerges when

3531
03:55:54,122 --> 03:55:59,193
"summoned or called to, or when it decides to make
a proclamation, drawing what little bit of

3532
03:55:59,193 --> 03:56:07,992
"children or families that it sees as a fun bit of
play to watch them bow and quiver in the street

3533
03:56:07,992 --> 03:56:16,320
"before asking for someone to prove their strength
and their worship of himself and strike them where

3534
03:56:16,320 --> 03:56:24,813
"they stand. Some days he's angry, some days he's
laughing; this dragon is completely insane, we

3535
03:56:24,813 --> 03:56:32,002
"can't really gauge. Red dragons are known for
pride, and you could count on that, use it against

3536
03:56:32,002 --> 03:56:40,335
"them, but sometimes his jaws quiver as he cries and
shakes and yells out laughing into the sky, a

3537
03:56:40,397 --> 03:56:49,110
"terrible laughter, one that can induce the worst
of nightmares. I don't know what we're dealing

3538
03:56:49,110 --> 03:57:01,470
"with anymore. However. We did have one team, a
very brave team, that provoked the dragon to leave

3539
03:57:01,470 --> 03:57:15,149
"its lair, and held it long enough for us to move
past it and pierce the inside of its sanctum. Now,

3540
03:57:15,149 --> 03:57:24,752
"we passed the wards, and the pools of fire. The
beast returned before we could get too far, and I

3541
03:57:24,752 --> 03:57:35,863
"lost most of my men, myself barely surviving with
my life, and the scars to tell of it. But the

3542
03:57:35,863 --> 03:57:44,537
"beast is building something in that lair.
Something it is guarding fiercely. And something

3543
03:57:44,537 --> 03:57:56,059
"that it will not leave. Something that I think it
has come to hold more dear than the city it now

3544
03:57:56,059 --> 03:58:07,075
"presides over. If there is a key to piercing its
pride, or if there is a reason to take it down, I

3545
03:58:07,075 --> 03:58:19,018
"begin to fear what it's holding below the city.
Now, by the might of the Wounded Mistress of

3546

"Knowledge, Ioun, in the channels in which we
speak, that is all the information I have. I hope

3547
03:58:27,063 --> 03:58:36,742
"it's helped in some way." And he sits down in his
chair and clutches his holy symbol.

3548
03:58:36,742 --> 03:58:38,051
LAURA: Oh, my god.

3549
03:58:38,051 --> 03:58:39,411
TALIESIN: This changes much.

3550
03:58:39,411 --> 03:58:40,773
MARISHA: Yes, it does.

3551
03:58:40,773 --> 03:58:56,388
LIAM: Dragon. You're awfully quiet. We need to
act. What do you advise?

3552
03:58:56,388 --> 03:59:00,650
MATT: Raishan's head slowly turns towards you and
the nostrils kind of, (snort). Not in an

3553
03:59:00,650 --> 03:59:08,949
aggressive way, but in acknowledgement. The bright
yellowish eyes, you can see the blackened veins

3554
03:59:08,949 --> 03:59:12,880
that curl up past the scales, some of the scales
actually splitting and pulling open what you can

3555
03:59:12,880 --> 03:59:26,219
see would be some sort of a contagion-based wound
that, while not infected, does not look positive.

3556
03:59:26,219 --> 03:59:39,381
Raishan's lips curl up, and the voice billows
forth, a low, curling growl. "Well. If the madness

3557
03:59:39,381 --> 03:59:49,119
"continues to spread, and our recent conversations
confirm this, you've gathered your allies.

3558
03:59:49,119 --> 03:59:56,301
"Distraction. Attack. Confusion. Chaos, striking
towards the center of the city is the best chance

3559
03:59:56,301 --> 04:00:11,385
"we have. If we have a way in, to break the
Cloudtop, we can battle it there, draw it from its

3560
04:00:11,385 --> 04:00:19,627
"lair. Force it to possibly rescind within, and
have our final battle there. Or, if luck is with

3561
04:00:19,627 --> 04:00:26,221
"us, finish it on the streets itself, and discover
whatever it is it's keeping while it lies dead and

3562
04:00:26,221 --> 04:00:27,891
"burning in the street."

3563
04:00:27,891 --> 04:00:29,196
LIAM: You say "we"?

3564
04:00:29,196 --> 04:00:32,834
LAURA: You'll fight alongside us?

3565
04:00:32,834 --> 04:00:36,234
MATT: "What have I to gain by watching you do this
yourself?"

3566
04:00:36,397 --> 04:00:43,043
MARISHA: I imagine whatever he's building. What is
he building, do you know?

3567
04:00:43,043 --> 04:00:46,676
MATT: "I have no idea. He lets nothing within his
sanctum."

3568
04:00:46,676 --> 04:00:47,848
MARISHA: Insight check!

3569
04:00:47,848 --> 04:00:49,298
MATT: Make an insight check.

3570
04:00:49,298 --> 04:00:52,263
TRAVIS: Come on, high insight.

3571
04:00:52,263 --> 04:00:54,849
MARISHA: What was that? That's okay, 23.

3572
04:00:54,849 --> 04:00:56,407
MATT: 23?

3573
04:00:56,407 --> 04:01:09,138
SAM: (gasps) Whispers... The promo link is
lootcrate.com/criticalrole, promo code

3574
04:01:09,138 --> 04:01:15,679
criticalrole for ten percent off your first month
and remember, you're doing this to support the

3575
04:01:15,679 --> 04:01:22,765
show, and to support my kid's pre-school class.
And the memory of Dennis.

3576
04:01:22,765 --> 04:01:24,020
LAURA: And Coachella.

3577
04:01:24,020 --> 04:01:30,831
LIAM: Coachella needs capoeira classes.

3578
04:01:30,831 --> 04:01:37,160
(laughter)

3579
04:01:37,160 --> 04:01:43,866
TALIESIN: We should also probably tell them about
Xanthas, that we did have...

3580
04:01:43,866 --> 04:01:46,647
SAM: Tell who about Xanthas?

3581
04:01:46,647 --> 04:01:48,277
TALIESIN: The room.

3582
04:01:48,277 --> 04:01:52,467
SAM: Oh. Well, there was a guy named Xanthas, we
killed him, he was a dick, what's there to tell?

3583
04:01:52,467 --> 04:01:55,733
TALIESIN: There is worth telling, is that
he had already turned and was working

3584
04:01:55,941 --> 04:01:56,945
for the Cinder King.

3585
04:01:56,945 --> 04:01:58,628
SAM: Keyleth.

3586
04:01:58,628 --> 04:02:02,927
TALIESIN: And he is now no longer with us.

3587
04:02:02,927 --> 04:02:16,314
LAURA: Brom? Do you know Osysa? The sphinx?

3588
04:02:16,314 --> 04:02:24,066
MATT: Thinks for a minute. "I do not know of this
sphinx. I am sorry."

3589
04:02:24,066 --> 04:02:27,541
LAURA: There's a temple to Ioun in Vasselheim.

3590
04:02:27,541 --> 04:02:30,290
MATT: There is a temple to Ioun? In Vasselheim?

3591
04:02:30,290 --> 04:02:32,276
LAURA: There is.

3592
04:02:32,276 --> 04:02:36,021
MATT: "That is good. Many temples have fallen
and hidden through the years since our

3593
04:02:36,021 --> 04:02:39,129
"mistress was wounded."

3594
04:02:39,129 --> 04:02:43,621
LAURA: You would have no way of contacting it?

3595
04:02:43,621 --> 04:02:50,140
MATT: "I can beseech my mistress for information.
But short of travelling to Vasselheim which I have

3596
04:02:50,140 --> 04:03:07,008
"not been to, I cannot help you. I apologise, since
the Calamity, during the struggle with Tharizdun,

3597
04:03:07,008 --> 04:03:17,304
"my mistress was grievously wounded in the
struggle, and since then has been diminished. And

3598
04:03:17,304 --> 04:03:23,317
"in this time many of those that seek to lessen her
hold on the world and the spread of the

3599
04:03:23,317 --> 04:03:29,107
"information and knowledge that we wish to share
have then hunted and persecuted those of us that

3600
04:03:29,107 --> 04:03:37,007
"follow in her wake. So the temples have been
buried or kept in distributed information through

3601
04:03:37,007 --> 04:03:45,931
"anonymous channels. Only a few of us in positions
of protection can speak out so strongly. This..."

3602
04:03:45,931 --> 04:03:52,921
Surprisingly, he turns back towards the ziggurat.
"This was one such temple."

3603
04:03:52,921 --> 04:03:54,943
MARISHA: What?

3604
04:03:54,943 --> 04:03:56,957
LAURA: Yeah, that's right, this was a temple to
Ioun, we knew that.

3605
04:03:56,957 --> 04:04:02,761
MARISHA: Right, right, okay. So wait, Tharizdun?

3606
04:04:02,761 --> 04:04:05,970
MATT: "Tharizdun, the Chained Oblivion."

3607
04:04:05,970 --> 04:04:07,468
MARISHA: Is that another god?

3608
04:04:07,468 --> 04:04:13,598
MATT: "Yes, a very evil one. Sealed, chained
away. Nothing you need to worry about. Not in

3609
04:04:13,598 --> 04:04:18,087
"the midst of this."

3610
04:04:18,087 --> 04:04:20,415
TALIESIN: We're going to have to go to Emon.

3611
04:04:20,415 --> 04:04:21,431
LAURA: Well, yeah.

3612
04:04:21,431 --> 04:04:28,004
SAM: Sure. We'll rally all the troops outside and
maybe go in through the tunnels? I guess when we

3613
04:04:28,004 --> 04:04:31,609
rally the troops we can form a more specific
plan.

3614
04:04:31,609 --> 04:04:35,392
TALIESIN: There will be several armies, we will
have allies. There will be troops to create

3615
04:04:35,392 --> 04:04:40,355
distractions, there will be troops that go into
the tunnels, there will probably be a group of

3616
04:04:40,355 --> 04:04:46,340
troops that go in to try and pierce the lair. We
will create chaos.

3617
04:04:46,340 --> 04:04:49,972
SAM: Ooh, did the airship ever show up?

3618
04:04:49,972 --> 04:04:55,941
MATT: Cassandra says "Yes, the airship has been
told to make its way towards Fort Daxio."

3619
04:04:55,941 --> 04:04:58,356
SAM: Oh that's good! Oh wait. Well, you know.

3620
04:04:58,356 --> 04:05:00,257
TALIESIN: It could actually pick up the people
there.

3621
04:05:00,257 --> 04:05:02,545
SAM: Sure, yeah.

3622
04:05:02,545 --> 04:05:07,356
TRAVIS: Do we want to do a last trip to Vasselheim
to talk to Osysa or... since we got all the Vestiges?

3623
04:05:07,356 --> 04:05:10,786
SAM: To do what? It's not all the Vestiges in the
world?

3624
04:05:10,786 --> 04:05:12,345
LAURA: No, all the ones she told us about.

3625
04:05:12,345 --> 04:05:14,063
TRAVIS: She was like, if you get these then 
I will help you.

3626
04:05:14,063 --> 04:05:15,636
SAM: Oh really? She said that?

3627
04:05:15,706 --> 04:05:17,480
LAURA: Did she say that?

3628
04:05:17,480 --> 04:05:19,470
TRAVIS: Did she say that?

3629
04:05:19,470 --> 04:05:20,760
MARISHA: Did she say that?

3630
04:05:20,760 --> 04:05:22,667
LAURA: Do we remember her saying anything like
that?

3631
04:05:22,667 --> 04:05:24,480
MATT: Well you didn't learn about the Vestiges
until it was--

3632
04:05:24,480 --> 04:05:26,702
LAURA: It was from her hubby, her boyfriend.

3633
04:05:26,702 --> 04:05:28,116
MATT: Yeah, Kamaljiori, it was, yeah.

3634
04:05:28,116 --> 04:05:29,815
TRAVIS: Yeah, that name.

3635
04:05:29,815 --> 04:05:31,517
LAURA: The one that said a name is earned.

3636
04:05:31,517 --> 04:05:32,624
MATT: Yes.

3637
04:05:32,624 --> 04:05:37,643
LAURA: Do we need to go to him?

3638
04:05:37,643 --> 04:05:39,429
TRAVIS: It's a sphinx.

3639
04:05:39,429 --> 04:05:42,215
LAURA: Was there anybody that said they would help
us once we got all the Vestiges? I feel like they

3640
04:05:42,215 --> 04:05:45,047
said that once we got all the Vestiges we'd be
like extra awesome.

3641
04:05:45,047 --> 04:05:46,697
SAM: We are extra awesome.

3642
04:05:46,697 --> 04:05:48,260
LAURA: Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3643
04:05:48,260 --> 04:05:51,597
MARISHA: I mean, there's some-- I feel like
there's not some sort of Voltron thing considering

3644
04:05:51,597 --> 04:05:54,984
there are more vestiges in the world.

3645
04:05:54,984 --> 04:05:58,839
TRAVIS: You lack imagination.

3646
04:05:58,839 --> 04:06:01,720
SAM: Quick, let's try to fit all of our Vestiges
together right now.

3647
04:06:01,720 --> 04:06:05,070
LAURA: Okay, let's do it.

3648
04:06:05,070 --> 04:06:07,200
SAM: I just stab at Pike.

3649
04:06:07,200 --> 04:06:08,876
LAURA: Ow ow ow ow.

3650
04:06:08,876 --> 04:06:10,719
ASHLEY: I don't feel anything.

3651
04:06:10,719 --> 04:06:13,102
TRAVIS: Does anything happen when they're all
touching?

3652
04:06:13,102 --> 04:06:16,948
(laughter)

3653
04:06:16,948 --> 04:06:21,278
MATT: You take all the Vestiges and and smush them
into a pile on the central table and all the rest

3654
04:06:21,278 --> 04:06:22,849
of the council kind of--

3655
04:06:22,849 --> 04:06:24,351
LAURA: Oh, it's not magic down here

3656
04:06:24,351 --> 04:06:29,767
MATT: --look curiously and they all gather around
as you begin to place them all into the central

3657
04:06:29,767 --> 04:06:34,965
area, kind of overlapping in almost the shape of a
person who is built of Vestiges. You put them each

3658
04:06:34,965 --> 04:06:39,736
one down, their kind of magical essence clinging
with the surface of the stone table.

3659
04:06:39,736 --> 04:06:41,610
LAURA: There's no magic down here!

3660
04:06:41,610 --> 04:06:44,090
LIAM: I just lie down across the entire table.

3661
04:06:44,090 --> 04:06:50,898
MATT: All right, the sound of them impacting. They
all sit there on the table.

3662
04:06:50,898 --> 04:06:53,251
LIAM: They don't stick to my armor somehow?

3663
04:06:53,251 --> 04:06:54,214
MATT: No.

3664
04:06:54,214 --> 04:06:57,512
TRAVIS: You gotta say a word.

3665
04:06:57,512 --> 04:07:02,660
MATT: Everyone's kind of standing there watching
quietly as nothing happens, and then Asum goes,

3666
04:07:02,660 --> 04:07:05,017
"All right then, um."

3667
04:07:05,017 --> 04:07:08,672
SAM: Maybe you should put your armor back on,
Pike.

3668
04:07:08,672 --> 04:07:10,236
ASHLEY: I mean, I have underclothes.

3669
04:07:10,236 --> 04:07:11,978
SAM: Okay.

3670
04:07:11,978 --> 04:07:17,050
MATT: Yeah, we had that discussion. You need
things beneath the armor or it'll cut you to shit.

3671
04:07:17,093 --> 04:07:20,435
ASHLEY: Just like bareback armor.

3672
04:07:20,435 --> 04:07:24,221
MATT: That'd be a bad idea. You'd get pinched in
all the wrong places.

3673
04:07:24,221 --> 04:07:27,915
TALIESIN: We do have-- Well, we do have our own
tunnel into the city that we can show-- Is anybody

3674
04:07:27,915 --> 04:07:30,453
using our tunnels into the city?

3675
04:07:30,453 --> 04:07:37,814
SAM: The Clasp? Oh you mean our specifically? Last
time I scryed there, there was someone in the keep.

3676
04:07:37,859 --> 04:07:39,229
LAURA: Can you scry there now?

3677
04:07:39,229 --> 04:07:41,162
SAM: No.

3678
04:07:41,162 --> 04:07:42,595
MARISHA: Wait, weren't they--

3679
04:07:42,595 --> 04:07:47,990
LAURA: Oh yeah, Keyleth! Can you scry? Not down
here. We have to leave the ziggurat.

3680
04:07:47,990 --> 04:07:49,882
MARISHA: I've got the Scrying Eye.

3681
04:07:49,882 --> 04:07:54,462
TALIESIN: If the keep is clear, that does give us
access. Possibly clear access.

3682
04:07:54,462 --> 04:07:56,798
LAURA: We could bamf into the keep.

3683
04:07:56,798 --> 04:07:59,254
SAM: Yeah, that just gets us inside the wall. That
doesn't-- that's it.

3684
04:07:59,254 --> 04:08:01,433
LIAM: That's not nothing.

3685
04:08:01,433 --> 04:08:03,363
SAM: The sewers is where we need to be.

3686
04:08:03,363 --> 04:08:11,521
LIAM: It connects. That'll get us under the wall.
What about-- What about Cashew? What about Shaun?

3687
04:08:11,521 --> 04:08:13,583
What about Zahra?

3688
04:08:13,583 --> 04:08:16,090
MARISHA: Cashew's kinda mad at us.

3689
04:08:16,090 --> 04:08:20,729
LIAM: Yeah, I'm sure he is, but this the end of
times.

3690
04:08:20,729 --> 04:08:26,060
MATT: Cassandra kind of raises her hand and goes,
"Kashaw and Zahra, they are ready to go whenever

3691
04:08:26,060 --> 04:08:26,865
you are ready."

3692
04:08:26,865 --> 04:08:28,852
LAURA: Sweet.

3693
04:08:28,852 --> 04:08:29,672
LIAM: Shaun?

3694
04:08:29,672 --> 04:08:34,621
MATT: "Shaun we've -- we're trying to decide if it
is best to keep someone here to maintain the

3695
04:08:34,657 --> 04:08:38,703
"barrier, or if we are going all in on
this, if we just send everyone out there

3696
04:08:38,703 --> 04:08:40,912
"and leave the city defenseless."

3697
04:08:40,912 --> 04:08:43,912
SAM: I think it's best to leave him here,
especially since that was his plan all along,

3698
04:08:43,912 --> 04:08:48,014
because he is a dominator of all worlds and a god
among men.

3699
04:08:48,014 --> 04:08:55,973
MATT: Allura raises her hand and goes, "Either I
or Shaun can run the barrier; you can decide. I

3700
04:08:55,973 --> 04:09:03,209
"don't mind staying back or going to the forefront.
It's your choice which one of us to take."

3701
04:09:03,209 --> 04:09:07,510
TRAVIS: Can Gilmore transport people like you
can?

3702
04:09:07,510 --> 04:09:10,151
MATT: "I believe he can, yes."

3703
04:09:10,151 --> 04:09:12,063
TRAVIS: I like Gilmore.

3704
04:09:12,063 --> 04:09:14,679
LIAM: For what? For keeping him alive or taking
him?

3705
04:09:14,679 --> 04:09:20,223
TRAVIS: No, bringing him with. Dude, he turned that
guy into a little pretzel dough ball. Just because

3706
04:09:20,266 --> 04:09:21,699
he fucked with him.

3707
04:09:21,699 --> 04:09:23,695
MARISHA: But Allura can teleport us back and
forth.

3708
04:09:23,695 --> 04:09:24,873
TRAVIS: Yeah, so can he.

3709
04:09:24,873 --> 04:09:26,600
MARISHA: Can he?

3710
04:09:26,600 --> 04:09:35,265
TRAVIS: That's what he just said.

3711
04:09:35,265 --> 04:09:38,278
TALIESIN: Allura signed up for this fight.

3712
04:09:38,278 --> 04:09:44,605
LIAM: Yeah, Allura, what do you want to do?

3713
04:09:44,605 --> 04:09:50,167
MATT: "It's interesting. I have a lot of personal
history with Thordak. I feel a deep sense of

3714
04:09:50,167 --> 04:09:56,572
"responsibility for all of this that still eats
away at me. And because of that a part of me

3715
04:09:56,572 --> 04:10:07,692
"really longs to be there with all of you, putting
this dark and fiery chapter to rest. On the other

3716
04:10:07,692 --> 04:10:13,573
"hand, having already faced him, and having an
inkling of what he is now, every part of me wants

3717
04:10:13,573 --> 04:10:16,873
"to run away. Screaming."

3718
04:10:16,873 --> 04:10:19,130
LIAM: But you have faced him.

3719
04:10:19,130 --> 04:10:20,396
MATT: "I have."

3720
04:10:20,396 --> 04:10:22,176
LIAM: And that's invaluable.

3721
04:10:22,176 --> 04:10:26,340
MATT: "I lost many good people in doing so."

3722
04:10:26,340 --> 04:10:29,005
TALIESIN: And we're going to lose many more.

3723
04:10:29,005 --> 04:10:36,728
MATT: "Most likely. So the choice is yours, Vox
Machina."

3724
04:10:36,728 --> 04:10:38,076
TRAVIS: Gilmore.

3725
04:10:38,076 --> 04:10:45,456
(laughing)

3726
04:10:45,456 --> 04:10:48,603
TRAVIS: No offense. You're lovely and very
strong.

3727
04:10:48,603 --> 04:10:52,683
MATT: You watch her audibly (sighs).

3728
04:10:52,683 --> 04:10:54,899
LAURA: Is that relief? That was relief.

3729
04:10:54,899 --> 04:11:00,558
MATT: It's both. It's a lot of things. It's an
emotionally conflicted exhale, but it is a relief

3730
04:11:00,558 --> 04:11:03,615
of tension regardless.

3731
04:11:03,615 --> 04:11:19,097
LIAM: I disagree. You fought this fucking thing
before. You know him. That is invaluable. You have

3732
04:11:19,097 --> 04:11:26,946
more experience than we do. You're wiser than us.

3733
04:11:26,946 --> 04:11:29,407
MARISHA: Scanlan? What do you think?

3734
04:11:29,407 --> 04:11:31,647
SAM: I think we should decide this the way we
always do.

3735
04:11:31,647 --> 04:11:32,704
LIAM: Coin toss?

3736
04:11:32,704 --> 04:11:34,535
SAM: Talk about it for a long, long time.

3737
04:11:34,535 --> 04:11:39,168
(laughter)

3738
04:11:39,168 --> 04:11:42,858
MATT: That's D&amp;D, man.

3739
04:11:42,858 --> 04:11:44,027
SAM: Let's put it to a vote.

3740
04:11:44,027 --> 04:11:45,877
LIAM: Experience. Experience.

3741
04:11:45,877 --> 04:11:53,283
SAM: A voice vote. All in favor of Gilmore, say,
"Hell yeah." All in favor of Allura, say, "Ah,

3742
04:11:53,283 --> 04:11:55,077
"sure, sure." Right?

3743
04:11:55,077 --> 04:11:56,606
SAM: Gilmore?

3744
04:11:56,606 --> 04:11:57,767
SAM, ASHLEY, TRAVIS: Hell yeah!

3745
04:11:57,767 --> 04:11:59,467
SAM: Oh, just us. Allura?

3746
04:11:59,467 --> 04:12:00,837
SAM, TALIESIN, LIAM, MARISHA: Ah, sure.

3747
04:12:00,837 --> 04:12:03,366
(laughter)

3748
04:12:03,366 --> 04:12:04,536
TRAVIS: But that was three and three. What'd you
vote?

3749
04:12:04,536 --> 04:12:06,287
ASHLEY: I voted Gilmore.

3750
04:12:06,287 --> 04:12:07,278
TRAVIS: That's four.

3751
04:12:07,278 --> 04:12:12,810
LIAM: I don't know what would happen. So: Gilmore,
Gilmore...

3752
04:12:12,875 --> 04:12:14,080
TRAVIS: Four and three.

3753
04:12:14,080 --> 04:12:15,397
TALIESIN: Gilmore doesn't want to go either.

3754
04:12:15,397 --> 04:12:18,481
ASHLEY: Neither of them want to go, but she's so
scared now.

3755
04:12:18,481 --> 04:12:23,387
MARISHA: Allura. Hang on, wait, I'm talking to
her. I'm not voting; I'm talking to her.

3756
04:12:23,387 --> 04:12:25,233
(laughter)

3757
04:12:25,233 --> 04:12:27,333
SAM: "Allura! I vote for Gilmore."

3758
04:12:27,333 --> 04:12:29,509
(laughter)

3759
04:12:29,509 --> 04:12:32,423
TALIESIN: Unless Gilmore feels like volunteering.

3760
04:12:32,423 --> 04:12:44,351
MARISHA: Allura, I have had destiny pushed upon me
since birth. What do you feel is right? Because

3761
04:12:44,351 --> 04:12:46,191
I'm not sure what to believe anymore.

3762
04:12:46,191 --> 04:12:47,932
LAURA: Make this decision for us!

3763
04:12:47,932 --> 04:12:50,067
MARISHA: Make this decision for us!

3764
04:12:50,067 --> 04:12:51,790
SAM: Hey, let's leave it to the dice!

3765
04:12:51,790 --> 04:12:58,717
MATT: Allura turns to you, kind of takes the side
of your head in her hands and says, "And in

3766
04:12:58,717 --> 04:13:08,008
"becoming a leader, you've been put in a position
to make very difficult choices. As you grow as a

3767
04:13:08,008 --> 04:13:14,437
"leader, you'll have to make many more. This is not
my choice to make."

3768
04:13:14,437 --> 04:13:16,499
MARISHA: But in many ways you've been our
leader--

3769
04:13:16,499 --> 04:13:17,985
(laughter)

3770
04:13:17,985 --> 04:13:21,132
SAM: We already voted, people! And Gilmore won!

3771
04:13:21,132 --> 04:13:24,270
TALIESIN: No, actually, Allura won.

3772
04:13:24,270 --> 04:13:27,085
MATT: "Who do you choose?"

3773
04:13:27,085 --> 04:13:28,720
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's four to three.

3774
04:13:28,720 --> 04:13:30,648
LIAM: Well, then, it's covered. Then it's done.

3775
04:13:30,648 --> 04:13:31,760
MATT: "Keyleth."

3776
04:13:31,760 --> 04:13:33,539
TALIESIN: All right.

3777
04:13:33,539 --> 04:13:39,148
LIAM: Unless you do what Laura and Marisha did and
do the exact opposite after the vote. Right? Come

3778
04:13:39,148 --> 04:13:40,681
on, Allura.

3779
04:13:40,681 --> 04:13:42,850
MARISHA: Wait, are you trying to use this as an
allegory?.

3780
04:13:42,850 --> 04:13:46,735
LIAM: No. That's just a throwback to, what
episode...?

3781
04:13:46,735 --> 04:13:48,766
MATT: At this point, Raishan picks up and goes--

3782
04:13:48,766 --> 04:13:50,800
MARISHA: Oh. Clarota?

3783
04:13:50,800 --> 04:13:55,186
MATT: "Oh, god, at the rate this is going, I think
perhaps neither of them are going to make it."

3784
04:13:55,186 --> 04:13:56,701
LAURA: Yeah. Sorry about that.

3785
04:13:56,701 --> 04:13:58,090
SAM: Trial by combat.

3786
04:13:58,090 --> 04:14:01,297
(laughter)

3787
04:14:01,297 --> 04:14:03,179
MATT: The survivor goes to Emon!

3788
04:14:03,179 --> 04:14:04,503
LAURA: I mean, is Gilmore strong enough?

3789
04:14:04,503 --> 04:14:06,460
MARISHA: Yeah, is he strong enough? Is he all
right?

3790
04:14:06,460 --> 04:14:09,969
TRAVIS: We'll rest him up; he'll be great. Pretzel
dough ball. It's gonna be amazing.

3791
04:14:09,969 --> 04:14:16,182
MATT: "Last I checked, he's handling the barrier,
but he's a capable man. May need a bit of rest,

3792
04:14:16,182 --> 04:14:20,534
"but so did you."

3793
04:14:20,534 --> 04:14:25,813
SAM: Quick stop to get his parents' permission,
then we're on our way.

3794
04:14:25,813 --> 04:14:26,957
MARISHA: Allura.

3795
04:14:26,957 --> 04:14:28,172
SAM: Wait, what? What happened?

3796
04:14:28,172 --> 04:14:29,223
LIAM: She's talking to her.

3797
04:14:29,223 --> 04:14:40,154
MARISHA: Fucking god dammit, you guys. I'm not
making votes here! In many ways, I feel--

3798
04:14:40,154 --> 04:14:41,718
(laughing)

3799
04:14:41,718 --> 04:14:42,719
MARISHA: What?

3800
04:14:42,719 --> 04:14:44,210
TRAVIS: We're taking Gilmore.

3801
04:14:44,210 --> 04:14:45,910
LAURA: No, she's talking to her!

3802
04:14:45,910 --> 04:14:48,676
LIAM: She's not trying to take her. She's talking
about something else.

3803
04:14:48,676 --> 04:14:56,406
MARISHA: Jesus Christ.

3804
04:14:56,406 --> 04:15:00,902
MATT: There are a few chuckles at the table now,
as everyone is just dumbfoundedly watching you all

3805
04:15:00,902 --> 04:15:03,491
argue over who to take for five minutes.

3806
04:15:03,491 --> 04:15:04,318
LIAM: Vox Machina.

3807
04:15:04,318 --> 04:15:06,265
MATT: Vox Machina.

3808
04:15:06,265 --> 04:15:13,594
MARISHA: In many ways, I feel we are walking down
the path you've already walked. In that case, I

3809
04:15:13,594 --> 04:15:21,454
feel it's time for new blood, and we've been with
Gilmore since the beginning. We need you as an

3810
04:15:21,454 --> 04:15:33,974
ally back here, we'll keep you on the sidelines as
an oracle, and we'll take Gilmore to be by our side.

3811
04:15:33,974 --> 04:15:38,689
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what we said
already.

3812
04:15:38,689 --> 04:15:43,940
MARISHA: Look, he set me up to make the call,
okay! I was trying to follow through, Jesus.

3813
04:15:43,940 --> 04:15:45,726
ASHLEY: You got it, Keyleth.

3814
04:15:45,726 --> 04:15:48,519
LIAM: Smash cut to Gilmore saying, "No fucking
way!"

3815
04:15:48,519 --> 04:15:59,945
MATT: "I'm not going, what are you talking about?!
No! That's suicide! They make me baguettes every

3816
04:15:59,945 --> 04:16:02,767
"morning in Whitestone. I'm staying here."

3817
04:16:02,813 --> 04:16:09,463
(laughter)

3818
04:16:09,463 --> 04:16:15,794
Allura kind of nods and goes, "Very well. I'll
send Kima as well. All the strength that we have

3819
04:16:15,794 --> 04:16:20,535
"in your direction. I'll stay here and play
guardian of Whitestone, as I have for quite some

3820
04:16:20,535 --> 04:16:30,971
"time." She looks to Cassandra, looks to Raishan,
everyone else, they all kind of nod and Cassandra

3821
04:16:31,041 --> 04:16:38,604
stands up, holds her collar and-- it's interesting
in moments like these that such a young girl still

3822
04:16:38,604 --> 04:16:45,006
carries the weight of a room like this, of such
giants by comparison to her and still can command

3823
04:16:45,006 --> 04:16:51,974
attention so quickly with a subtle physicality.
And then she adjusts her collar a bit and raises

3824
04:16:51,974 --> 04:17:02,930
her chin. "And so it is. Vox Machina, we gather
our forces. Put your minds together. Decide on

3825
04:17:02,977 --> 04:17:12,934
"your plan of action, your means of attack. Soon we
begin the assault on Emon."

3826
04:17:12,934 --> 04:17:18,780
And that's where we'll end our episode for
tonight.

3827
04:17:18,780 --> 04:17:25,023
SAM: At dawn, we vote!

3828
04:17:25,023 --> 04:17:31,212
MARISHA: I demand a recount! In Pennsylvania and
Florida specifically.

3829
04:17:31,212 --> 04:17:33,136
LIAM: You know, Gilmore won the popular vote.

3830
04:17:33,136 --> 04:17:38,422
(laughter)

3831
04:17:38,422 --> 04:17:44,897
MATT: You guys, thank you very much. We're on the
home stretch, it looks like.

3832
04:17:44,897 --> 04:17:46,820
LAURA: Oh my god.

3833
04:17:46,820 --> 04:17:54,032
MATT: Man. All right. You guys have a week to plan
amongst yourselves what to do next time.

3834
04:17:54,032 --> 04:17:57,201
MARISHA: Are we assuming that we're sleeping after
this? Because god damn.

3835
04:17:57,201 --> 04:17:59,068
ASHLEY: We already just slept.

3836
04:17:59,068 --> 04:18:01,478
MARISHA: That's right, because we bamfed to
Whitestone. Never mind.

3837
04:18:01,478 --> 04:18:07,269
MATT: Correct, yes, you've only used your spell
there. We will unfortunately not have a Travis

3838
04:18:07,269 --> 04:18:10,823
Willingham next week, or Ashley Johnson.

3839
04:18:10,823 --> 04:18:13,634
LAURA: Oh fuck. It's going to be an empty bench
over here.

3840
04:18:13,634 --> 04:18:18,713
MATT: However, based on the gathering of allies
just for this battle, we may have a guest or two.

3841
04:18:18,713 --> 04:18:22,399
(gasps)

3842
04:18:22,399 --> 04:18:23,882
SAM: Gathering?

3843
04:18:23,882 --> 04:18:25,174
MATT: You guys are gathering all your allies.

3844
04:18:25,174 --> 04:18:28,024
SAM: As in, like, the Insane Clown Posse is
coming?

3845
04:18:28,024 --> 04:18:30,019
MATT: Yeah man! The Dark Carnival's here!

3846
04:18:30,019 --> 04:18:32,681
(laughter)

3847
04:18:32,681 --> 04:18:34,130
SAM: Next week on Critical Role.

3848
04:18:34,130 --> 04:18:36,025
MATT: Just start spraying Faygo all over you
guys.

3849
04:18:36,025 --> 04:18:41,162
LAURA: Wait, it's happening next week?
We're going into battle? We don't have

3850
04:18:41,162 --> 04:18:44,182
Travis and Ashley?

3851
04:18:44,182 --> 04:18:45,759
TALIESIN: Shit's happening.

3852
04:18:45,759 --> 04:18:48,489
LIAM: Dude, that city's probably like the nine
circles of Hell, we're not just going to get

3853
04:18:48,489 --> 04:18:51,006
there, fast track to Thordak.

3854
04:18:51,006 --> 04:18:52,605
LAURA: Okay okay okay.

3855
04:18:52,605 --> 04:18:57,634
TRAVIS: If you got Lin Manuel next week, I will
kill you.

3856
04:18:57,634 --> 04:19:00,392
LAURA: No, it's not, don't say-- no it's not.

3857
04:19:00,392 --> 04:19:02,894
MATT: I wish, I wish, that'd be great.

3858
04:19:02,894 --> 04:19:05,159
TRAVIS: I'm just putting it out there, I don't
want to have to kill you.

3859
04:19:05,159 --> 04:19:08,524
MATT: All right, cool.

3860
04:19:08,524 --> 04:19:09,738
TRAVIS: Thank you, Loot Crate!

3861
04:19:09,738 --> 04:19:14,202
MATT: Thank you Loot Crate, again, for being a
great sponsor. Thank you guys so much for watching

3862
04:19:14,202 --> 04:19:22,341
tonight, we'll see you Tuesday at Talks Machina,
and Thursday for the continuation of this

3863
04:19:22,341 --> 04:19:29,422
climactic downwards spiral into ancient red dragon
territory.

3864
04:19:29,422 --> 04:19:31,506
LIAM: This bullet-proof think-tank.

3865
04:19:31,506 --> 04:19:35,513
MATT: Yeah, what could possibly go wrong? (laughs)
Anyway guys, have a wonderful week, a wonderful

3866
04:19:35,513 --> 04:19:41,460
weekend, a wonderful evening, and is it Thursday
yet? Good night.

3867
04:19:46,740 --> 04:25:15,261
