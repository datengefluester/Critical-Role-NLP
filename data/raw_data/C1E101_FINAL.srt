1
00:00:00,067 --> 00:00:03,247
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:03,247 --> 00:00:08,385
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons and Dragons at the same table. Thank you

3
00:00:08,385 --> 00:00:12,918
so much for your patience. As mentioned last week,
we're adjusting and changing and updating things

4
00:00:12,918 --> 00:00:17,621
and taking your feedback and our feedback, and
everyone's been working really hard to make this

5
00:00:17,621 --> 00:00:20,857
set progressively better and better to make it a
better experience. This is our first time all at

6
00:00:20,857 --> 00:00:23,670
the same table since the home game.

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,083
(cheering)

8
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:32,203
MATT: But no, seriously, don't do that. That's
okay.

9
00:00:32,203 --> 00:00:34,069
MARISHA: Still in front of a green screen.

10
00:00:34,069 --> 00:00:37,749
MATT: Still in front of a green screen. Totally.
Thank you guys so much for being patient. We are

11
00:00:37,749 --> 00:00:42,562
up now, and let's dive into the announcements for
the evening. We don't have a whole lot this week,

12
00:00:42,562 --> 00:00:46,805
but we have, let's see. Any updates as far as the
merch is concerned?

13
00:00:46,805 --> 00:00:51,686
LAURA: The merchandises? Well, you know, we do
have that amazing David Mack poster.

14
00:00:51,686 --> 00:00:56,578
SAM: But I thought that was only a limited-release
item, Laura.

15
00:00:56,578 --> 00:01:01,832
LAURA: It is, actually, but it's available for
three more weeks. The signed version is available

16
00:01:01,832 --> 00:01:08,068
for two more weeks. And since it is a limited-time
release thing, if you know anybody that watches

17
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:12,894
the show but is maybe way behind and they're not
watching live, it would probably be nice to let

18
00:01:12,894 --> 00:01:17,501
them know about it, because I still get some
messages about the Joe Mad poster that people

19
00:01:17,501 --> 00:01:23,153
can't get anymore. So it will be gone after this,
so it's nice if they can get it, too. And we have

20
00:01:23,153 --> 00:01:27,482
the Scanlan tee, and we have our amazing Slayer's
Take aprons. Slayer's Cake aprons.

21
00:01:27,482 --> 00:01:29,988
SAM: Let's talk about the Scanlan t-shirt a little
more.

22
00:01:29,988 --> 00:01:32,822
LAURA: We have the amazing Scanlan concert tee.

23
00:01:32,822 --> 00:01:35,959
TRAVIS: That asshole? No, we're good.

24
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:39,450
LAURA: And, you know, a bunch of other t-shirts as
well, and a whole bunch of other things. Go check

25
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,117
out the shop on geekandsundry.com and you'll see
all of the merchandise that's available.

26
00:01:44,117 --> 00:01:58,097
MATT: All right, cool. Also, a reminder, guys, the
Tal'Dorei campaign guide's coming out at GenCon in

27
00:01:58,097 --> 00:02:03,691
August. Pre-orders go up, I believe, mid-July, and
I think if you pre-order it, I think it's like

28
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:07,400
five extra bucks or something like that, you get
the PDF download immediately. All the information

29
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:12,036
is on Green Ronin's website, so go check it out if
you have any questions there, because they can

30
00:02:12,036 --> 00:02:17,311
answer them better than I can. I'm steeped in art
approvals and everything right now.

31
00:02:17,311 --> 00:02:20,221
MARISHA: The art is looking so good!

32
00:02:20,221 --> 00:02:25,472
MATT: It's looking awesome. We've pulled in some--
we've got a lot of community artists that we

33
00:02:25,472 --> 00:02:29,349
pushed over towards Green Ronin, so they've been
pulling people from the community, which makes me

34
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:32,250
happy, because I want to get as many of you guys
involved as possible in this.

35
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,448
LAURA: As many of us as possible?

36
00:02:34,448 --> 00:02:36,067
LIAM: I can't draw for shit.

37
00:02:36,067 --> 00:02:37,358
SAM: I can do some art.

38
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:39,170
MATT: I was referring to the community, not you
guys.

39
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,807
TRAVIS: Sam's art is really rare.

40
00:02:40,807 --> 00:02:47,027
MATT: Yeah, I've seen it, and it's pretty... yeah.
They all wind up looking like genitals. It's

41
00:02:47,027 --> 00:02:49,934
crazy. We have the podcast, which is now up.

42
00:02:49,934 --> 00:02:52,010
(cheering)

43
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:55,160
MATT: Audio podcast, for people who want to save
their data and listen on long drives.

44
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,139
LAURA: Who don't want to look at our faces.

45
00:02:57,139 --> 00:02:58,723
MATT: I don't blame you.

46
00:02:58,723 --> 00:03:01,761
TRAVIS: For no other reason than for those Sam
Riegel advertisements at the beginning.

47
00:03:01,761 --> 00:03:11,343
MATT: So we got that. And we have Wednesday Club.

48
00:03:11,343 --> 00:03:14,791
TALIESIN: Yeah, Wednesday Club next week. I don't
actually know what we're doing, because I haven't

49
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:19,741
looked at the 30-plus messages in that text
thread, because I've been working on a thing that

50
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,521
I can't talk about yet that's going to be really,
really great.

51
00:03:22,521 --> 00:03:29,017
SAM: Taliesin, I feel like most of the time you
don't know what you're going to be talking about.

52
00:03:29,017 --> 00:03:30,299
TALIESIN: That's true.

53
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:33,504
SAM: So maybe you should just have a go-to. Like,
it's going to be Daredevil again. Or something.

54
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,631
Just something.

55
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:39,204
TALIESIN: What are we going to-- yeah, we need a
go-to. What was going to be our blanket go-to?

56
00:03:39,204 --> 00:03:40,450
I'm not sure.

57
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,363
TRAVIS: Punisher.

58
00:03:41,363 --> 00:03:42,660
MARISHA: Great Lakes Avengers

59
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,169
TALIESIN: Great Lakes Avengers is actually pretty
spectacular. It's hard to say it.

60
00:03:45,169 --> 00:03:46,475
Great Lakes Avengers.

61
00:03:46,475 --> 00:03:49,588
MATT: Make a big effort to bring back the What
the--?! comics.

62
00:03:49,588 --> 00:03:53,114
LIAM: What about the scientology graphic novels?

63
00:03:53,114 --> 00:03:55,251
TALIESIN: I haven't read those. Do they have
those?

64
00:03:55,251 --> 00:03:56,868
LIAM: Well, I'm up to level six.

65
00:03:56,868 --> 00:03:58,725
(laughter)

66
00:03:58,725 --> 00:04:01,065
TALIESIN: Do you want to be a guest on the show?

67
00:04:01,065 --> 00:04:07,001
MATT: You've almost learned invisibility! Anyway.
Apologies to all our scientology fans.

68
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:08,871
SAM: Yeah, we just lost half the audience.

69
00:04:08,871 --> 00:04:12,813
MATT: All right, so.

70
00:04:12,813 --> 00:04:16,978
LIAM: Sea Org uniforms, watching a giant-screen TV
of Critical Role.

71
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:22,090
(laughter)

72
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:25,228
MATT: Exactly. And Signal Boost?

73
00:04:25,228 --> 00:04:30,034
MARISHA: Jeff Lewis. We announced it on Tuesday on
Talks. Yeah, Jeff Lewis, still Jeff.

74
00:04:30,034 --> 00:04:34,946
MATT: All right, cool. Then, unless we have
anything else to announce, let's get into

75
00:04:34,946 --> 00:04:39,537
tonight's episode of Critical Role.

76
00:04:39,537 --> 00:06:09,122
[dramatic music]

77
00:06:09,182 --> 00:06:16,182
MATT: Welcome back. So, getting us up to speed as
to what happened last time. Vox Machina had

78
00:06:16,182 --> 00:06:21,849
recently been visited by an old ally, Scanlan
Shorthalt, who had spent the past year or so--

79
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:23,266
LAURA: An old ally.

80
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:35,059
MATT: Yeah. Hey. Building a reputation and a
criminal ring in Ank'harel as a forging master in

81
00:06:35,059 --> 00:06:45,829
various types of furniture and accoutrements. And
upon realizing through the aid of one his hired help,

82
00:06:45,829 --> 00:06:54,519
Lionel, or Chud. Chad? Chod. Whatever the various
pronunciations were that came through. Discovered

83
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:59,932
that there was a second sphere, apparently on some
sort of pyramid-like ziggurat structure not far

84
00:06:59,932 --> 00:07:05,504
from Ank'harel. Upon you returning as Scanlan to
notify the party, you all made your way to

85
00:07:05,504 --> 00:07:11,762
Ank'harel, briefly met with Kaylie, and saw a
little bit of the setup that they've been building

86
00:07:11,762 --> 00:07:16,764
for the past year or so, and then made your way
towards the Smouldercrown Mountains to the

87
00:07:16,764 --> 00:07:23,054
southeast of Ank'harel, where apparently this
structure resides and this cult, that is apparently

88
00:07:23,054 --> 00:07:29,881
sacrificing objects of magical power towards this
black sphere. So you made your way to the

89
00:07:29,881 --> 00:07:33,295
outskirts of this mountain, discovered that the
entrance that was previously there had been

90
00:07:33,295 --> 00:07:40,722
collapsed, and discovered a new, carved entrance
into the mountain, were beset by a few traps, made

91
00:07:40,722 --> 00:07:46,627
your way into a far corner, set up a mansion, and
after dealing rather briskly with a cluster of

92
00:07:46,627 --> 00:07:52,051
undead that had built up on the outside of your
entryway to your magnificent mansion, you made

93
00:07:52,051 --> 00:07:57,451
your way to the final chamber where the structure
was residing. A number of cultists there were in

94
00:07:57,451 --> 00:08:01,874
the process of quickly, hastily throwing these
objects to the top and then noticed that you had

95
00:08:01,874 --> 00:08:09,525
come as interlopers into this space. At which
point you realized the head of cult, at least this

96
00:08:09,525 --> 00:08:16,802
group here at the top of the pyramid, was none
other, seemingly, than Lady Delilah Briarwood.

97
00:08:16,802 --> 00:08:20,023
ALL: No, no, no!

98
00:08:20,023 --> 00:08:27,278
MATT: Who then protected herself and two of her
cult members beneath the veil of a Prismatic Wall

99
00:08:27,278 --> 00:08:32,653
in the shape of a sphere, and you did battle with
a number of undead and other cultists and

100
00:08:32,653 --> 00:08:36,922
followers of the Whispered One that involved
largely just throwing a bunch of them into the

101
00:08:36,922 --> 00:08:43,616
ceiling, including yourselves, thanks to a
well-placed Reverse Gravity. Scanlan had darted

102
00:08:43,616 --> 00:08:48,378
past the Prismatic Wall with a clever use of
Dimension Door.

103
00:08:48,378 --> 00:08:49,531
SAM: Should've died.

104
00:08:49,531 --> 00:08:54,712
MATT: Actually, no. Looking at the rules, too. It
was a good call to bring it back, in my opinion.

105
00:08:54,712 --> 00:09:03,484
But nevertheless, they escaped seemingly into the
sphere, Delilah and two of these cultists, after

106
00:09:03,484 --> 00:09:09,803
turning it from this glowing white back into its
black magic-absorbing self, leaving you all there.

107
00:09:09,803 --> 00:09:17,081
Managed to cleanse Pike of her Feeblemind spell,
and after acquiring a few of these magical

108
00:09:17,081 --> 00:09:22,897
artifacts that were left unbroken, and some cult
robes, and apparently symbols of this cult of the

109
00:09:22,897 --> 00:09:27,706
Whispered One, you now stand in the middle of this
cavern on the outside of where this second

110
00:09:27,706 --> 00:09:32,642
Ziggurat exists, deciding what to do next, and
what the next step of this journey means for you.

111
00:09:32,642 --> 00:09:35,709
So, Vox Machina, what would you like to do?

112
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:39,384
LAURA: What should we do next? What does the next
step on this journey mean for us?

113
00:09:39,384 --> 00:09:42,262
LIAM: I'm getting wicked deja-vu, brah.

114
00:09:42,262 --> 00:09:47,250
MARISHA: That was so existential of you, Vex.
Wow.

115
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:52,156
LAURA: No, but really. What should we fucking do?
Should we go through it?

116
00:09:52,156 --> 00:09:55,748
MARISHA: That was a really meaty spell she had.
I've never seen that before.

117
00:09:55,748 --> 00:09:58,763
ASHLEY: Thank you, Keyleth, for bringing me back.

118
00:09:58,763 --> 00:10:01,498
SAM: I don't know how much time has passed since
the fight, but

119
00:10:01,498 --> 00:10:04,753
can Taryon cast Revivify on Doty still?

120
00:10:04,753 --> 00:10:07,862
MATT: No, that much time has passed,
unfortunately.

121
00:10:07,862 --> 00:10:09,222
LAURA: Doty's gone again?

122
00:10:09,222 --> 00:10:10,887
TRAVIS: Did you lose a second one?

123
00:10:10,887 --> 00:10:13,620
SAM: I came back to get him!

124
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,951
TRAVIS: He's like iPhones, they just come out
every so often.

125
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:23,722
TALIESIN: The Doty 6 is going to have a much
better camera. It's going to have better voice

126
00:10:23,722 --> 00:10:25,973
recognition. You're really going to be happy with
it.

127
00:10:25,973 --> 00:10:32,797
MATT: You could use the same funds to bring that
Doty back, it would just take you the week in

128
00:10:32,797 --> 00:10:36,864
reconstruction anyway. But you're not losing that
Doty. The other one, you unfortunately lost in the

129
00:10:36,864 --> 00:10:41,575
City of Dis, but this can be brought back at the
same cost of a new one. So you're not having to

130
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:43,318
reconstruct an entirely new Doty.

131
00:10:43,318 --> 00:10:44,653
MARISHA: Recycling.

132
00:10:44,653 --> 00:10:45,797
MATT: Yeah.

133
00:10:45,797 --> 00:10:48,153
SAM: But I have to get his body somewhere.

134
00:10:48,153 --> 00:10:49,295
MATT: Yes, you do.

135
00:10:49,295 --> 00:10:50,507
SAM: Great.

136
00:10:50,507 --> 00:10:52,672
TALIESIN: I kind of want to collapse this cave.

137
00:10:52,672 --> 00:10:54,488
TRAVIS: With us in it?

138
00:10:54,488 --> 00:11:02,518
TALIESIN: No, not with us in it. I don't think we
can destroy the ziggurat, but I think we can at

139
00:11:02,518 --> 00:11:07,362
least make it extremely difficult to find and get
to, and make it very uncomfortable for anything

140
00:11:07,362 --> 00:11:09,142
that tries to come through.

141
00:11:09,142 --> 00:11:11,113
LAURA: That's true. That would be smart.

142
00:11:11,113 --> 00:11:13,638
SAM: But then we can't come through.

143
00:11:13,638 --> 00:11:16,886
LAURA: We have another entrance. We have the one
in Whitestone.

144
00:11:16,886 --> 00:11:22,783
LIAM: Also, though, this is an exit. Do you want
the only exit to be in your basement? The only

145
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:26,464
one? Or are there more of these places?

146
00:11:26,464 --> 00:11:31,423
SAM: Also, does each portal go to the same place,
or do they go to different parts?

147
00:11:31,423 --> 00:11:34,355
TALIESIN: We saw the spire in both images,
correct?

148
00:11:34,355 --> 00:11:41,728
MATT: With the brief glance through the-- Well,
the arrow was in the one beneath Whitestone.

149
00:11:41,728 --> 00:11:48,120
Through your connecting with Sarenrae, the vision
that you received through that portal seemed to be

150
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,473
very similar to what Vex described seeing through
her arrow.

151
00:11:52,473 --> 00:11:57,833
LAURA: It could be the same portal or they could
both be within view of the tower.

152
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:00,287
TALIESIN: I'm imagining a circle of spheres.

153
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:03,333
MARISHA: And both seem to suck magic in, correct?

154
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,175
LAURA: Yeah, they do the same thing.

155
00:12:05,175 --> 00:12:11,125
TALIESIN: I think we'll have an easier time
keeping track of what is coming in and out if we

156
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:14,091
just have one to deal with as opposed to two.

157
00:12:14,091 --> 00:12:16,105
LAURA: That's assuming there's only two.

158
00:12:16,105 --> 00:12:21,988
TRAVIS: Is it a stupid idea to shoot another
Oracle Arrow through this one

159
00:12:21,988 --> 00:12:23,575
and see if it looks the same?

160
00:12:23,575 --> 00:12:25,480
TALIESIN: I don't know if we have the option.

161
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:31,986
LAURA: I can try, but in Whitestone, there was at
least a visual path toward the ball, but I don't

162
00:12:31,986 --> 00:12:33,906
think there is one here, is there?

163
00:12:33,906 --> 00:12:35,266
MATT: Not within the radius.

164
00:12:35,266 --> 00:12:36,864
LAURA: Not within the magic orb.

165
00:12:36,864 --> 00:12:38,115
MARISHA: It's too tight a room?

166
00:12:38,115 --> 00:12:44,139
LIAM: I think I like your idea, but I worry that
we're upping the odds of-- Listen, we just found

167
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:49,498
out that she's alive, or something. She's going to
unleash some sort of fresh hell somewhere. We're

168
00:12:49,498 --> 00:12:52,295
upping the odds of it happening under your living
room.

169
00:12:52,295 --> 00:13:00,044
TALIESIN: I know. It's just, what if it happens in
both places at once?

170
00:13:00,044 --> 00:13:02,686
LAURA: What if we collapse the one in Whitestone?

171
00:13:02,686 --> 00:13:08,675
TALIESIN: It's directly under the castle. We would
have to maybe fill it with, I don't know. Submerge

172
00:13:08,675 --> 00:13:10,046
it or some such.

173
00:13:10,046 --> 00:13:13,426
LAURA: At least try to block off the entrance to
where they can't get out.

174
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:21,072
MARISHA: Is there an underground water source near
Whitestone?

175
00:13:21,072 --> 00:13:22,771
TALIESIN: There's acid pits.

176
00:13:22,771 --> 00:13:25,028
MARISHA: We could try and flood it with acid.

177
00:13:25,028 --> 00:13:30,129
ASHLEY: What if we blocked off that entrance when
we go inside?

178
00:13:30,129 --> 00:13:35,437
TALIESIN: Let's at least make sure this cave is
collapsed. We'll leave the chamber standing, but

179
00:13:35,437 --> 00:13:39,914
every entrance to this cave should be collapsed.
We know there's three of them.

180
00:13:39,914 --> 00:13:44,135
LAURA: What if we block this one, and then we
block the one in Whitestone, and then we just--

181
00:13:44,135 --> 00:13:45,418
SAM: Game over!

182
00:13:45,418 --> 00:13:48,568
LAURA: I think we win, then, right?

183
00:13:48,568 --> 00:13:52,105
TALIESIN: We'll be able to get back in if we need
to, we just want to make sure that no one can

184
00:13:52,105 --> 00:13:55,065
wander in and out of here without making a bit of
a ruckus.

185
00:13:55,065 --> 00:13:57,656
LAURA: So there are three entrances that we know
of, and we need to block all of them.

186
00:13:57,656 --> 00:13:58,934
TALIESIN: One's already blocked.

187
00:13:58,934 --> 00:14:02,666
SAM: And one, do we know where it is?

188
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,472
LAURA: There's one up top that we heard about.

189
00:14:04,472 --> 00:14:10,341
LIAM: How much time do I have left on my wings? A
lot, probably, like a half hour or 40 minutes? It

190
00:14:10,341 --> 00:14:11,894
wasn't that long.

191
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:17,406
MATT: Well, no, actually, because when you used
your wings outside, you guys came inside. Did you

192
00:14:17,406 --> 00:14:18,983
use your wings during the battle?

193
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,090
LIAM: Yeah, I did.

194
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:23,494
MATT: Did you guys take a long rest?

195
00:14:23,494 --> 00:14:25,335
TALIESIN: We did, because we had the mansion.

196
00:14:25,335 --> 00:14:30,110
MATT: You did. So by this conversation happening,
the rummaging through the bodies, inspecting the

197
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:33,058
vicinity, I'd say you maybe have 20 more minutes
on your wings.

198
00:14:33,058 --> 00:14:37,020
LAURA: Oh yeah, did we rummage through the bodies?
Let's rummage through those bodies.

199
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,688
MATT: You did, that's how you found the objects.

200
00:14:39,688 --> 00:14:45,730
MARISHA: While they rummage, Keyleth wants to test
the radius.

201
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:47,565
SAM: No, we found the objects on that cart.

202
00:14:47,565 --> 00:14:50,110
MATT: That's right, you found them on the cart.
You did not actually rummage through the bodies.

203
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:52,347
LAURA: Is there anything on the bodies?

204
00:14:52,347 --> 00:14:56,819
MATT: Make an investigation check.

205
00:14:56,819 --> 00:15:01,414
LAURA: Whoa, that was high. 23.

206
00:15:01,414 --> 00:15:08,720
MATT: 23, okay. Over the next 15 or so minutes, as
you go through and begin to gather the corpses,

207
00:15:08,776 --> 00:15:15,441
most of the skeletons out here that have armor on,
it's old, rusted, destroyed, broken armor, and the

208
00:15:15,441 --> 00:15:21,043
weapons either fell apart in the battle against
you or are just barely usable or functional at

209
00:15:21,043 --> 00:15:26,985
this point in time. Of the various cultists'
bodies, the armor on the black guard that you were

210
00:15:26,985 --> 00:15:40,327
battling is a pretty nice-looking set of full
plate. You also find similar symbols, these dark

211
00:15:40,327 --> 00:15:44,413
iron necklaces that you found on the previous
cultists.

212
00:15:44,413 --> 00:15:47,800
LAURA: We'll take those. We can take the plate
armor if there's room for it in the bag, and then

213
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,544
see if it's actually magical outside of the
field.

214
00:15:49,544 --> 00:15:52,929
TALIESIN: How many of those necklaces have we
found?

215
00:15:52,929 --> 00:15:54,594
MATT: Six.

216
00:15:54,594 --> 00:15:55,810
TALIESIN: Six necklaces.

217
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:59,120
LAURA: All right, and we already had two, so now
all of us have one.

218
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,571
TRAVIS: I can make room in the Bag of Holding for
the armor, but I have to get rid of one of these

219
00:16:02,571 --> 00:16:07,295
two bodies. Does anybody object if I throw one of
the bodies at the little black marble?

220
00:16:07,295 --> 00:16:09,051
LIAM: I would kind of like to see that.

221
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:14,552
TALIESIN: Actually, I think that's a pretty good
idea, but you have to remove it from the bag

222
00:16:14,552 --> 00:16:16,049
before you walk over to the marble.

223
00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:17,056
TRAVIS: I have to what?

224
00:16:17,056 --> 00:16:19,013
TALIESIN: You have to remove the body from the bag
before you walk over.

225
00:16:19,013 --> 00:16:23,687
TRAVIS: Oh right, okay. So can I walk back to the
fork?

226
00:16:23,687 --> 00:16:25,484
TALIESIN: Remove them both.

227
00:16:25,538 --> 00:16:27,953
TRAVIS: Back to the fork. I pull out-- both? We
only need one.

228
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:29,041
TALIESIN: All right.

229
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:30,856
TRAVIS: I pull one body out.

230
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:32,291
LAURA: He likes to save his bodies for later.

231
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,777
TRAVIS: Listen, I'll run my store the way I run my
store. I pull one body out.

232
00:16:34,777 --> 00:16:38,996
MATT: Which, just as a note, the visual of Grog
pulling this body out of the Bag of Holding is

233
00:16:38,996 --> 00:16:47,503
much like trying to pull a Slim Jim out of the
wrapper. It pulls weird and you have to yank.

234
00:16:47,503 --> 00:16:50,487
TRAVIS: What an analogy. The sausage without the
casing.

235
00:16:50,487 --> 00:16:55,876
MATT: Yeah, it's like by sections, and you watch
him strain as you pull some out and it folds over.

236
00:16:55,876 --> 00:17:05,069
It's just really awkward and awful. But yeah, you
manage to get the body out.

237
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:08,953
TRAVIS: Close the Bag of Holding and I just drag
him back over.

238
00:17:08,953 --> 00:17:10,722
MATT: (impacts) Up each step.

239
00:17:10,722 --> 00:17:16,293
TRAVIS: Everybody ready? And a one, and a two, and
a (whoosh).

240
00:17:16,293 --> 00:17:22,062
MATT: As you throw it, it impacts, and you watch
as the body stops in mid-air from the gravity,

241
00:17:22,062 --> 00:17:27,000
stopping where it stands. Its legs fold over, and
like a broken physics engine, you watch as the

242
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,106
body (crackling) twists, cracks, and gets sucked
in.

243
00:17:31,106 --> 00:17:35,538
LAURA: Let's not do that. Let's not go through
that hole.

244
00:17:35,538 --> 00:17:37,727
TRAVIS: It really doesn't seem that bad.

245
00:17:37,727 --> 00:17:42,841
TALIESIN: I kind of want to experiment. Would you
mind losing one of the necklaces, or no?

246
00:17:42,841 --> 00:17:45,906
LAURA: We can try.

247
00:17:45,906 --> 00:17:48,820
TALIESIN: Let's put a necklace on the other
cadaver and then throw it through.

248
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:52,804
TRAVIS: I literally just walked all the way over
there and now you want me to go back?

249
00:17:52,804 --> 00:17:57,231
TALIESIN: You need the cardio, let's not pretend
you don't. We're going to put one of the necklaces

250
00:17:57,231 --> 00:18:03,133
on the body and throw it through. It'll still be
fun to watch.

251
00:18:03,133 --> 00:18:08,189
TRAVIS: I walk back out of the realm of the thing,
pinching my belly fat because apparently Percy

252
00:18:08,189 --> 00:18:10,089
thinks I'm a couple pounds heavy.

253
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,489
LAURA: It's all that ale, Grog.

254
00:18:12,489 --> 00:18:18,845
TALIESIN: I can only mock you on graph paper. I
take what I can fucking get, man.

255
00:18:18,845 --> 00:18:21,053
TRAVIS: I'll pull the other Slim Jim out of the
bag.

256
00:18:21,053 --> 00:18:29,869
MATT: (suction sound) You place one of the various
symbols around its neck and then Babe Ruth-style

257
00:18:29,869 --> 00:18:37,178
lob it, and you watch as it gets within a certain
proximity, the orb seems to shimmer and shift open

258
00:18:37,178 --> 00:18:43,051
ever so slightly. It's similar to what you saw, it
opened to a mouthed gateway when Delilah and the

259
00:18:43,051 --> 00:18:48,105
other cultists walked through. The body still
rattles, and you watch it twist a bit, but it's a

260
00:18:48,105 --> 00:18:50,600
far less impactful transition.

261
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:58,624
LAURA: All right, so now we have seven of those
things, and we have to get eight of us through.

262
00:18:58,624 --> 00:19:06,536
TALIESIN: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, yes. Somebody will have to stay behind, but

263
00:19:06,536 --> 00:19:09,600
we'll figure that out if we go that direction.
There's other options.

264
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,227
SAM: Who's the eighth?

265
00:19:11,227 --> 00:19:12,460
TALIESIN: You.

266
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,109
LAURA: You and you, bitch.

267
00:19:15,109 --> 00:19:19,482
SAM: I live in Ank'harel and I'm a crime boss.

268
00:19:19,482 --> 00:19:23,094
LAURA: Yeah, and you're here with us now.

269
00:19:23,094 --> 00:19:26,524
ASHLEY: You're not planning on going with us?

270
00:19:26,524 --> 00:19:28,788
SAM: I hadn't been invited.

271
00:19:28,788 --> 00:19:29,940
LAURA: Scanlan.

272
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:38,542
TRAVIS: That was pretty-- I mean, from a third
party, non-influenced or partial perspective,

273
00:19:38,542 --> 00:19:41,865
flipping gravity was pretty cool.

274
00:19:41,865 --> 00:19:47,321
LIAM: Plus, he's got a lot of big words now. You
want to be around to see them in action.

275
00:19:47,321 --> 00:19:52,040
MARISHA: Technically, I can flip gravity. I don't
know. I felt like I should put it on the table.

276
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,161
SAM: Oh, okay, see, you don't really need me after
all.

277
00:19:54,161 --> 00:19:57,746
MARISHA: No, that's not what I meant. I just
wanted to be honest.

278
00:19:57,746 --> 00:19:59,248
LAURA: I haven't seen you do it.

279
00:19:59,248 --> 00:20:00,945
MARISHA: Well, it hasn't been relevant yet.

280
00:20:00,945 --> 00:20:06,651
LIAM: You're also really clever. Forget your
spells. And funny, and it's good to have you

281
00:20:06,651 --> 00:20:10,491
around, so yeah, do you want to go someplace
really horrible with your family, or what?

282
00:20:10,491 --> 00:20:20,252
SAM: All right. Are you all offering?

283
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:24,436
TRAVIS: I don't know, Pike. Can he earn his way
back in in this manner?

284
00:20:24,436 --> 00:20:29,703
ASHLEY: Well, I do think we could use the help.

285
00:20:29,703 --> 00:20:41,047
SAM: The help. Okay, that's good enough for me.
I'm in. Will fancy boy be joining us?

286
00:20:41,047 --> 00:20:43,002
ASHLEY: Are you jealous of him?

287
00:20:43,002 --> 00:20:45,713
SAM: No. He's part of the team.

288
00:20:45,713 --> 00:20:48,123
ASHLEY: He is part of the team.

289
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:50,097
LAURA: Tary, what do you think?

290
00:20:50,097 --> 00:20:51,877
SAM: Shit! This again!

291
00:20:51,877 --> 00:20:57,879
LIAM: Tary, it's up to you, but you were talking
about going back.

292
00:20:57,879 --> 00:21:01,815
SAM: I'm sorry, I was busy caring for my deceased
robot.

293
00:21:01,815 --> 00:21:04,232
LAURA: Is Doty...

294
00:21:04,232 --> 00:21:09,640
SAM: No, he's fine. He'll be fine. I just have to
rebuild him. It'll take some time and money, which

295
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,891
I don't have.

296
00:21:10,891 --> 00:21:13,396
ASHLEY: I wish I could help, Tary, but I think
that's out of my...

297
00:21:13,396 --> 00:21:15,331
TALIESIN: We can get him back to Whitestone, he'll
be perfectly fine.

298
00:21:15,331 --> 00:21:16,881
We have everything we need there.

299
00:21:16,881 --> 00:21:19,411
SAM: All right. I need him for the brigade!

300
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:20,650
TALIESIN: Of course.

301
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,064
LAURA: The brigade, right.

302
00:21:22,064 --> 00:21:27,856
SAM: Yes. But I can't carry him. Grog, would you
be able to...

303
00:21:27,856 --> 00:21:40,682
MATT: "I can carry him!" And you look over and
Chod goes over and grabs Doty. (grunt) "Should I

304
00:21:40,682 --> 00:21:42,646
"put him somewhere?"

305
00:21:42,646 --> 00:21:46,318
SAM: Not yet, Chod. Wait until we get somewhere
where I can work on it.

306
00:21:46,318 --> 00:21:48,035
MATT: "Okay."

307
00:21:48,035 --> 00:21:55,135
TALIESIN: I say we head back to Whitestone. We
gather resources, we figure out how we're getting

308
00:21:55,135 --> 00:21:56,680
where we're going to get.

309
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:01,650
MARISHA: We could theoretically forge more of
these, right? Or do you think they're blessed?

310
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:04,450
TALIESIN: Let's find out. We now know they work.

311
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:10,427
LIAM: I wonder if we could take them to Allura or
to Shaun.

312
00:22:10,427 --> 00:22:13,431
LAURA: Well, have Tary Identify them. Maybe it's
something specific.

313
00:22:13,431 --> 00:22:16,501
MARISHA: Yeah, are they magical, Tary? Are these
magical?

314
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:17,617
SAM: Let me look.

315
00:22:17,617 --> 00:22:18,938
LAURA: Outside of the field.

316
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:20,608
MARISHA: Outside of the field.

317
00:22:20,608 --> 00:22:30,098
MATT: They are magical. It's a mild enchantment.
It's not extremely strong, but it is very

318
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:38,054
specific, and it is more of an attunement to a
specific plane. It has something to do with

319
00:22:38,054 --> 00:22:49,295
whoever's bearing it, or whatever's wearing it, is
already partially crossed to a certain extent, so

320
00:22:49,295 --> 00:22:54,077
it limits the impact of the transition.

321
00:22:54,077 --> 00:22:57,523
SAM: Okay. I don't understand any of that. But
there you have it.

322
00:22:57,523 --> 00:22:59,602
LAURA: Do you have any more Identify left?

323
00:22:59,602 --> 00:23:00,790
SAM: Sure.

324
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:07,071
LAURA: Can we have you Identify the plate armor
that the big guy was wearing, so we can see if

325
00:23:07,071 --> 00:23:08,292
it's magical?

326
00:23:08,292 --> 00:23:09,615
SAM: I do that.

327
00:23:09,615 --> 00:23:20,605
MATT: Very well. So this is Plate Armor of
Resistance to radiant.

328
00:23:20,605 --> 00:23:27,326
LAURA: So it's immune to Pike.

329
00:23:27,326 --> 00:23:29,749
TALIESIN: It's anti-Pike armor.

330
00:23:29,749 --> 00:23:34,619
MARISHA: Well, that kind of clues us in on a lot,
actually.

331
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:39,841
SAM: Chod can't use that, can he?

332
00:23:39,841 --> 00:23:44,041
MATT: Do you ask this question of him?

333
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:45,636
SAM: Chod, can you use this?

334
00:23:45,636 --> 00:23:48,299
MATT: "Can I have it?"

335
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:50,634
SAM: I mean, do we need it?

336
00:23:50,634 --> 00:23:51,754
ASHLEY: Well...

337
00:23:51,754 --> 00:23:53,938
SAM: Do we need it?

338
00:23:53,938 --> 00:23:55,604
TALIESIN: Yes, let's not...

339
00:23:55,604 --> 00:23:56,929
SAM: Do we need it?

340
00:23:56,929 --> 00:23:57,942
TALIESIN: Yes.

341
00:23:57,942 --> 00:24:01,159
TRAVIS: Radiant means all gods or just good gods?

342
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:04,763
LAURA: Just good gods I think.

343
00:24:04,763 --> 00:24:07,580
TALIESIN: I would like to put somebody in this
armor in Whitestone so that whoever comes through

344
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:11,033
the portal, the first thing they see is something
that they feel comfortable and familiar with.

345
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:14,286
MATT: "Those boots are better than my boots. Can I
have the boots?"

346
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,500
TALIESIN: Yes. Well, what kind of boots are they?

347
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,997
MATT: It's full armor plate. They're still part of
the armor set.

348
00:24:20,997 --> 00:24:27,641
TALIESIN: We can get you something else nice. I
have a plan for this armor!

349
00:24:27,641 --> 00:24:40,222
LAURA: I have so many things. Wait, hold on, Chod.
There's-- Oh, Chod! Do you want a jewelry box that

350
00:24:40,222 --> 00:24:41,553
makes music?

351
00:24:41,553 --> 00:24:43,563
ASHLEY: No, you can't give him that jewelry box!

352
00:24:43,563 --> 00:24:46,792
MATT: He leans over to Scanlan. "Hey, boss. Do I
want a jewelry box?"

353
00:24:46,792 --> 00:24:49,030
SAM: Yes. Just say yes.

354
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,839
MATT: "Yes, I would love a jewelry box. Thank
you."

355
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:52,801
LAURA: Do you? It makes music. You like music.

356
00:24:52,801 --> 00:24:54,066
MATT: "It makes music, do I want it?"

357
00:24:54,066 --> 00:24:55,870
SAM: When a girl offers you something, you just
say yes.

358
00:24:55,870 --> 00:25:00,653
MATT: "Yes, please. Take all of it." Now he's
carrying the music box and Doty.

359
00:25:00,653 --> 00:25:02,058
(laughter)

360
00:25:02,058 --> 00:25:03,595
LAURA: I'll mark that off.

361
00:25:03,595 --> 00:25:07,965
LIAM: Lionel, I have the perfect thing for you.
And I pull out the metal skullcap.

362
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:13,352
MATT: "That's loud."

363
00:25:13,352 --> 00:25:15,458
LAURA: Wait. Wait. Is that the Clarota one?

364
00:25:15,458 --> 00:25:20,440
LIAM: No, that's the Lionel Gayheart one. People
will have a harder time

365
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,956
fucking with you, in general.

366
00:25:21,956 --> 00:25:26,416
LAURA: That is the Clarota one, wasn't it? You're
giving the Clarota thing,

367
00:25:26,416 --> 00:25:28,609
the resistance-to-mind stuff?

368
00:25:28,609 --> 00:25:30,217
LIAM: Yes, I am.

369
00:25:30,217 --> 00:25:31,952
LAURA: Because we could maybe use that.

370
00:25:31,952 --> 00:25:33,721
TRAVIS: Yeah, there's still an idiot in this
group.

371
00:25:33,721 --> 00:25:36,039
LAURA: Yeah, there's maybe a Grog in the group
that could totally use it!

372
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:39,092
LIAM: I've had this hat for years.

373
00:25:39,092 --> 00:25:42,652
LAURA: I know! So maybe you should remember that
you have it and give it to fucking Grog!

374
00:25:42,652 --> 00:25:47,415
LIAM: I've known that I've had it, and I've talked to him
about it. No one's ever asked about it, you've

375
00:25:47,415 --> 00:25:48,510
never asked about it.

376
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:49,789
LAURA: I didn't know you had it!

377
00:25:49,789 --> 00:25:51,902
LIAM: You are a hoarder. You are many good
things--

378
00:25:51,902 --> 00:25:57,893
LAURA: No! I'm just saying, if Grog has resistance
to mind control, then that would be really good

379
00:25:57,893 --> 00:26:00,306
for us in a fight with somebody that's really
powerfully--

380
00:26:00,306 --> 00:26:04,679
LIAM: Grog. This skullcap that Lionel is wearing
requires attunement. Would you like to give up one

381
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:06,863
of your really lethal weapons--

382
00:26:06,863 --> 00:26:09,461
TRAVIS: No. Didn't we talk about this?

383
00:26:09,461 --> 00:26:12,697
LAURA: I didn't know it required attunement.

384
00:26:12,697 --> 00:26:14,215
TALIESIN: Sense of dignity, perhaps?

385
00:26:14,215 --> 00:26:19,741
TRAVIS: Ooh, hey! Is he heavy? Don't you have your
own Bag of Holding?

386
00:26:19,741 --> 00:26:21,858
MATT: "No."

387
00:26:21,858 --> 00:26:23,126
TRAVIS: Oh.

388
00:26:23,126 --> 00:26:26,632
LAURA: Not everybody has a Bag of Holding, Grog.

389
00:26:26,632 --> 00:26:29,268
TRAVIS: I'll just give him mine.

390
00:26:29,268 --> 00:26:32,981
(laughter)

391
00:26:32,981 --> 00:26:36,298
LAURA: We just give him everything.

392
00:26:36,298 --> 00:26:39,807
TALIESIN: We would turn on you so fast. Let's get
back to Whitestone.

393
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:43,091
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay. How do we collapse these
tunnels--

394
00:26:43,091 --> 00:26:44,862
MATT: "You guys can keep putting things on me.
That's fine."

395
00:26:44,862 --> 00:26:47,823
TALIESIN: Well, we have, thankfully, a
professional tunnel collapser.

396
00:26:47,823 --> 00:26:49,237
LAURA: Well, that's true!

397
00:26:49,237 --> 00:26:50,984
TRAVIS: Yep. Oh, me?

398
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:54,493
TALIESIN: So let's find the upstairs entrance and
get rid of that--

399
00:26:54,493 --> 00:26:56,606
LAURA: I'll do that from outside.

400
00:26:56,606 --> 00:27:03,145
MARISHA: I was trying to test the radius of this
sphere, too. Am I still doing that?

401
00:27:03,145 --> 00:27:04,571
Is that still relevant?

402
00:27:04,571 --> 00:27:07,177
TALIESIN: Well, it's worth noting just in case we
cannot find the opening.

403
00:27:07,177 --> 00:27:12,319
MATT: It comes to about 180 feet from the actual
sphere.

404
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:16,788
MARISHA: Wow! That's a long way. It's the same as
the other one?

405
00:27:16,788 --> 00:27:23,898
MATT: It's similar from when you originally tested
it. It was about the width of the whole chamber

406
00:27:23,898 --> 00:27:28,900
underneath Whitestone. And that chamber was more
cleared out, more of the actual structure was

407
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:33,280
visible. This one is still partially buried and
you're only seeing the upper half of it.

408
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,714
MARISHA: Okay.

409
00:27:34,714 --> 00:27:38,976
LIAM: Do I even have the ability to fly in here?
Is there an outer edge where the magic is not--

410
00:27:38,976 --> 00:27:40,356
MATT: In that chamber, you cannot fly.

411
00:27:40,356 --> 00:27:41,329
LIAM: Cannot. Okay.

412
00:27:41,329 --> 00:27:45,444
LAURA: And I feel like we're going to run into
traps if we try to find it from this way. Maybe

413
00:27:45,444 --> 00:27:47,347
find it from the outside and just collapse it.

414
00:27:47,347 --> 00:27:48,369
TALIESIN: All right.

415
00:27:48,369 --> 00:27:50,864
LAURA: That way we don't have to go through a
series of shit.

416
00:27:50,864 --> 00:27:56,723
TALIESIN: Let's double-reinforce, just pile-drive
the one that's already a little collapsed and make

417
00:27:56,723 --> 00:27:59,844
it really collapsed. And then we'll collapse the
others while we're leaving.

418
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:00,942
LAURA: Yeah.

419
00:28:00,942 --> 00:28:04,295
TRAVIS: (happy grunts) Is that permission?

420
00:28:04,295 --> 00:28:08,747
TALIESIN: That is more than permission. That is
permission and an audience. We're very excited.

421
00:28:08,747 --> 00:28:13,316
TRAVIS: That's amazing. I'll go for it, and I'll
whack on a wall. Do I just hit a wall anywhere?

422
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:15,224
LAURA: Just in the tunnels, maybe?

423
00:28:15,224 --> 00:28:18,005
SAM: Wait. You're an engineer, aren't you?

424
00:28:18,005 --> 00:28:21,005
TALIESIN: Yes. No, we're going to be pointing at
the things that need to collapse.

425
00:28:21,005 --> 00:28:22,606
TRAVIS: Okay, I'm ready any time.

426
00:28:22,606 --> 00:28:26,750
LAURA: Do you want to go up and see if we can find
the thing up top?

427
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:29,055
MARISHA: Yeah! Sure! You guys have fun
collapsing.

428
00:28:29,055 --> 00:28:31,422
LAURA: It's daytime now, right? Outside?

429
00:28:31,422 --> 00:28:33,975
MATT: At this time, it would be. Yes.

430
00:28:33,975 --> 00:28:36,611
LAURA: So can me and Keyleth go try to find the
entrance up top so

431
00:28:36,611 --> 00:28:38,268
we can do something to that one?

432
00:28:38,268 --> 00:28:39,353
Matt: Sure, okay.

433
00:28:39,353 --> 00:28:41,258
TRAVIS: Or should we wait 'til we collapse the
tunnels?

434
00:28:41,258 --> 00:28:44,136
TALIESIN: Well, they can find theirs while we get
our tunnels collapsed.

435
00:28:44,136 --> 00:28:46,048
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm sure it won't fall on me. No big
deal.

436
00:28:46,048 --> 00:28:49,495
ASHLEY: I'm going to help! I'm going to help you.

437
00:28:49,495 --> 00:28:50,469
TRAVIS: Yeah!

438
00:28:50,469 --> 00:28:51,372
ASHLEY: Yeah.

439
00:28:51,372 --> 00:28:54,137
MARISHA: If it falls on you, we can fish you out.
Just survive a little bit.

440
00:28:54,137 --> 00:28:59,721
ASHLEY: Keyleth's got our back. She'll burrow in
and pull us out.

441
00:28:59,721 --> 00:29:02,524
LAURA: Just earring us if something happens.

442
00:29:02,524 --> 00:29:07,116
MARISHA: Badger. Badgers burrow, right? Do badgers
burrow?

443
00:29:07,116 --> 00:29:08,129
LIAM: They do burrow.

444
00:29:08,129 --> 00:29:10,814
TRAVIS: That's why I said stay, but that's all
right!

445
00:29:10,814 --> 00:29:16,596
MATT: (laughs) All righty. So you guys all make
your way back to the second entrance, the hidden,

446
00:29:16,596 --> 00:29:21,009
illusory one. You all back out of it, leaving just
Pike and Grog on the inside.

447
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:25,293
TALIESIN: And we're helping them figure out where
to punch to make everything--

448
00:29:25,293 --> 00:29:28,562
MATT: Okay, cool. So I need you to go ahead and make
an investigation check.

449
00:29:28,562 --> 00:29:29,794
TALIESIN: All right.

450
00:29:29,794 --> 00:29:31,913
MATT: And you can assist him, which gives him
advantage.

451
00:29:31,913 --> 00:29:33,724
SAM: Ah. I will assist you.

452
00:29:33,724 --> 00:29:39,106
TALIESIN: Thank you. Oh, yes. That's excellent.
It's a 19.

453
00:29:39,106 --> 00:29:40,483
(laughter)

454
00:29:40,483 --> 00:29:46,754
MATT: Total of 19? Okay. Halfway through the
hallway, you find the place where the initial

455
00:29:46,754 --> 00:29:51,477
collapse was started. Or you start looking to see
what they used to destroy the first entrance that

456
00:29:51,477 --> 00:29:56,950
you were supposed to come through. You can see the
way it's carved, designed, especially the smooth

457
00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:02,721
entrance. Which, now that you get a better look at
it, that soft, spongy ground, that dust you were

458
00:30:02,721 --> 00:30:11,758
finding: you begin to recognize the pattern of
what carved its way in. You saw it used at the top

459
00:30:11,758 --> 00:30:18,740
of the Emberhold when you were fighting the queen
there. It was a series of Disintegration rays used

460
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:23,023
to carve away into this mountain. That's what that
dust is that's on the ground. And why it's such a

461
00:30:23,023 --> 00:30:25,145
smooth entrance on this side.

462
00:30:25,145 --> 00:30:28,493
MARISHA: But I rolled so shitty on that nature
check before, right?

463
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:34,985
MATT: Mm-hm. However, because it was just a series
of magic Disintegrations pushed through to create

464
00:30:34,985 --> 00:30:42,348
this second opening, it's a little harder to find
points in the structure where the weakness is. So

465
00:30:42,348 --> 00:30:48,327
you begin to cut away at some areas, you get like
a small axe or one of the various objects that

466
00:30:48,327 --> 00:30:50,862
you've-- pointed objects that you've acquired over
the--

467
00:30:50,862 --> 00:30:52,565
TRAVIS: I do have just a regular pickaxe.

468
00:30:52,565 --> 00:30:57,754
MATT: Yeah. And you just hit at some areas, and
you do find one section where you would think it

469
00:30:57,754 --> 00:31:02,253
would be a relatively weak point of impact between
the various rocks and stones that hold this up.

470
00:31:02,253 --> 00:31:06,643
TALIESIN: Hit this and stand on this side of it,
and that should do some intense damage.

471
00:31:06,643 --> 00:31:08,592
MATT: You would recommend hitting it and then
running.

472
00:31:08,592 --> 00:31:10,113
TALIESIN: And run in this direction.

473
00:31:10,113 --> 00:31:11,763
(laughter)

474
00:31:11,763 --> 00:31:12,895
TRAVIS: Okay, Pike.

475
00:31:12,895 --> 00:31:13,668
ASHLEY: Yeah.

476
00:31:13,668 --> 00:31:17,921
TRAVIS: I want you to warm up this spot for me,
and then you're going to jump on my back and then

477
00:31:17,921 --> 00:31:19,263
I'm going to hit it.

478
00:31:19,263 --> 00:31:22,491
ASHLEY: Okay. I jump on your back now?

479
00:31:22,491 --> 00:31:24,171
TRAVIS: No, no, you hit it.

480
00:31:24,171 --> 00:31:25,325
ASHLEY: Like a backpack?

481
00:31:25,325 --> 00:31:27,138
TRAVIS: Yeah, and then you can come up on my
back.

482
00:31:27,138 --> 00:31:28,319
ASHLEY: Oh, I hit it.

483
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:32,447
LIAM: Do we jump on three, or is it one, two,
three, go?

484
00:31:32,447 --> 00:31:39,439
MATT: Pike. Go ahead and make a strength check, as
Grog throws you up to the ceiling to where the one

485
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:42,490
place in the rock structure is.

486
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:43,966
ASHLEY: Yeah boi.

487
00:31:43,966 --> 00:31:46,826
TRAVIS: Ready to run, just in case she just goes
beast mode.

488
00:31:46,826 --> 00:31:50,726
MARISHA: We should make little Pike backpacks.

489
00:31:50,726 --> 00:31:54,639
LAURA: Oh my gosh, how cute would that be?

490
00:31:54,639 --> 00:31:57,380
SAM: With, like, Ashley's face right here.

491
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,170
(laughter)

492
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:01,248
ASHLEY: No, guys, that doesn't need to be
anywhere.

493
00:32:01,248 --> 00:32:03,859
LIAM: We'll just repurpose those Yoda bags.

494
00:32:03,859 --> 00:32:04,958
ASHLEY: 13.

495
00:32:04,958 --> 00:32:09,358
MATT: 13? Okay, so you take her and you alley-oop
and you (impact) hit it and you watch it

496
00:32:09,358 --> 00:32:14,835
(cracking) and some dust falls and settles. A
couple of small pebbles (falling pebbles). And you

497
00:32:14,835 --> 00:32:17,671
grab her like, oh! Okay, seems okay for now.

498
00:32:17,671 --> 00:32:19,598
TRAVIS: All right. Get on, Yoda.

499
00:32:19,598 --> 00:32:24,354
ASHLEY: I try to wrap my legs around, but they
don't go.

500
00:32:24,354 --> 00:32:25,676
TRAVIS: I rage first.

501
00:32:25,676 --> 00:32:31,883
MARISHA: Just her but with, like, a jockey on a
horse. (straining)

502
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:35,241
MATT: Okay, so it just happens naturally. So go
ahead and roll a strength check with advantage.

503
00:32:35,241 --> 00:32:37,198
MARISHA: Those gnomish thighs.

504
00:32:37,198 --> 00:32:39,285
TRAVIS: 23.

505
00:32:39,285 --> 00:32:46,741
MATT: 23. So for the height of the cavern here,
you get yourself a nice-- you crouch low and full

506
00:32:46,741 --> 00:32:53,925
shoryuken-style, like (impact) punch into the roof
and as you hit it, impact and go clean through and

507
00:32:53,925 --> 00:32:57,702
bring it to the ground. Land, and you hear the
(crumbling).

508
00:32:57,702 --> 00:32:59,205
TALIESIN: All right, run.

509
00:32:59,205 --> 00:33:04,093
MATT: You guys start bolting through, and as
you're rushing, Pike, you're looking over and you

510
00:33:04,093 --> 00:33:11,607
can see the walls (impacts). You guys are bolting
out as well. Both of you guys go ahead and make

511
00:33:11,607 --> 00:33:13,322
dexterity saving throws, please.

512
00:33:13,322 --> 00:33:14,942
TRAVIS: I forgot we had to roll for this part.

513
00:33:14,942 --> 00:33:15,877
ASHLEY: Me too.

514
00:33:15,877 --> 00:33:17,002
TRAVIS: I got advantage.

515
00:33:17,002 --> 00:33:18,809
LAURA: Oh god, don't drop Pikeys.

516
00:33:18,809 --> 00:33:20,045
TRAVIS: Oh, that's good.

517
00:33:20,045 --> 00:33:21,888
ASHLEY: Okay okay, 16.

518
00:33:21,888 --> 00:33:25,350
TRAVIS: 20. No-- 18.

519
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:30,920
MATT: Okay, so as you guys are bolting, you're
holding onto Grog, and you manage to look behind

520
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:34,942
just fast enough to see one of the walls is
about to full-on collapse at the side, and you go

521
00:33:34,942 --> 00:33:39,093
ahead and grab the side of Grog's ear and yank his
vision that way.

522
00:33:39,139 --> 00:33:40,462
TRAVIS: (groan)

523
00:33:40,462 --> 00:33:42,390
ASHLEY: Just going to start kicking him in the
side.

524
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:46,036
MATT: He starts turning off to that side, and you
manage to just avoid that side of the wall as it

525
00:33:46,036 --> 00:33:46,960
(impact).

526
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,211
SAM: Gif it! Gif it!

527
00:33:48,211 --> 00:33:51,089
(laughter)

528
00:33:51,089 --> 00:33:54,876
MATT: So you start steering him from behind like a
prized racehorse, and making your way through this

529
00:33:54,876 --> 00:33:59,898
cavern until eventually the back half of the
cavern collapses and comes to a rest. The front

530
00:33:59,898 --> 00:34:04,965
half is not collapsing, but you do-- you have a
large portion of the path leading to the ziggurat

531
00:34:04,965 --> 00:34:06,585
is now just rubble and rocks.

532
00:34:06,585 --> 00:34:09,177
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay! Good job!

533
00:34:09,177 --> 00:34:10,455
TRAVIS: Nice job!

534
00:34:10,455 --> 00:34:11,589
TALIESIN: Well done, well done.

535
00:34:11,589 --> 00:34:17,305
ASHLEY: We're getting somewhere. But we still
need-- there's still more to do?

536
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:23,259
LAURA: Yeah, there's that whole other path. There's
that whole-- there's that whole other path and

537
00:34:23,259 --> 00:34:24,746
then the one up top.

538
00:34:24,746 --> 00:34:25,655
ASHLEY: Okay.

539
00:34:25,655 --> 00:34:28,136
LAURA: But I could hear a rumble so I know you
guys did good on one of those paths already.

540
00:34:28,136 --> 00:34:29,572
ASHLEY: Thanks! We did pretty good.

541
00:34:29,572 --> 00:34:35,491
MATT: Okay. The rest of it is fairly easy to do
because you find the closer you get to the

542
00:34:35,491 --> 00:34:40,996
entrance, based on the previous collapsing,
elements of it have started to show cracks, like

543
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:45,248
the actual weight, because it was just a smooth
transition there. There was no load-bearing

544
00:34:45,248 --> 00:34:51,952
platforms or any sort of general structure to the
interior of this cavern. So you guys manage to

545
00:34:51,952 --> 00:34:56,305
pummel your way out, a large spinning punch on
this side and this side as you're rushing out, and

546
00:34:56,305 --> 00:34:59,687
as you do (impacts) you hear it slamming and
hitting the ground behind you until you guys

547
00:34:59,687 --> 00:35:02,690
emerge through. It looks like you're running
straight at a wall because the illusory wall is

548
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:09,314
still there, but you both just out the other side.
Immediate hot daylight hits you, the blaring sun

549
00:35:09,314 --> 00:35:17,864
of the Marquet sky. Clear blue sky, no clouds.
You're now surrounded by a series of browned and

550
00:35:17,864 --> 00:35:21,832
leafless trees with these large canopies that have
the same pear-like

551
00:35:21,832 --> 00:35:23,997
fruit hanging from the branches.

552
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:25,766
TRAVIS: Fruit? Fruit?

553
00:35:25,766 --> 00:35:27,272
MATT: Looks like fruit.

554
00:35:27,272 --> 00:35:28,517
TRAVIS: Are you hungry?

555
00:35:28,517 --> 00:35:29,464
ASHLEY: I'm hungry!

556
00:35:29,464 --> 00:35:32,076
TRAVIS: Hold on. I hold up Pike to go grab some
fruit.

557
00:35:32,076 --> 00:35:33,910
ASHLEY: We'll check it!

558
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:35,513
TRAVIS: Don't worry, it's just fruit.

559
00:35:35,513 --> 00:35:37,046
MATT: Make a nature check.

560
00:35:37,046 --> 00:35:38,490
LIAM: She can cure us of poison.

561
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:42,651
TALIESIN: Not if she's busy dying from both ends.

562
00:35:42,651 --> 00:35:46,447
LAURA: (retching) The spins.

563
00:35:46,447 --> 00:35:48,504
ASHLEY: Six.

564
00:35:48,504 --> 00:35:51,453
MATT: It's hard to tell, but it looks really
tasty.

565
00:35:51,453 --> 00:35:59,242
TRAVIS: Yeah, I got great nature skills! Five.

566
00:35:59,242 --> 00:36:02,915
MATT: So. Looks tasty.

567
00:36:02,915 --> 00:36:04,783
ASHLEY: You know what, Grog?

568
00:36:04,783 --> 00:36:05,674
TRAVIS: What?

569
00:36:05,674 --> 00:36:10,288
ASHLEY: As hungry as I am, I think we should wait
to have Keyleth look at this fruit.

570
00:36:10,288 --> 00:36:11,808
TRAVIS: Why? It's just fruit!

571
00:36:11,808 --> 00:36:18,080
ASHLEY: Because it's outside of this cave, and
what if it's a distraction like, "Oh, lookit!"

572
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,520
and you eat it and you just die?

573
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:25,786
TRAVIS: You know, I've found if fruit, when it
goes bad, falls from the tree, and it's still on

574
00:36:25,786 --> 00:36:27,286
it! Therefore!

575
00:36:27,286 --> 00:36:30,093
ASHLEY: And when fruit goes bad, it turns into
wine!

576
00:36:30,093 --> 00:36:31,917
TRAVIS: You get crunk drunk!

577
00:36:31,917 --> 00:36:36,202
ASHLEY: I think I'm going to wait for Keyleth.

578
00:36:36,202 --> 00:36:37,933
TRAVIS: I'm going to have a bite.

579
00:36:37,933 --> 00:36:48,842
MATT: Okay. You take a bite and it's got a fairly
moist center. You can see now, like a cactus, the

580
00:36:48,842 --> 00:36:55,472
fruits here, most of the moisture is retained
within these fruit elements. The flavor, it's not

581
00:36:55,472 --> 00:37:03,941
sweet, it's quite pungent, actually. It has a
bitterness to it. It's like putting your tongue in

582
00:37:03,941 --> 00:37:05,561
a bunch of lye.

583
00:37:05,561 --> 00:37:09,730
ASHLEY: Does it taste good?

584
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:14,147
TRAVIS: (disgusted noises)

585
00:37:14,147 --> 00:37:19,336
ASHLEY: Maybe make some mayonnaise or something?
Want some mayonnaise to cleanse your palate?

586
00:37:19,336 --> 00:37:26,523
TRAVIS: I take out the jug and I go: honey! Hey!

587
00:37:26,523 --> 00:37:29,441
ASHLEY: Oh, all right!

588
00:37:29,441 --> 00:37:33,742
LAURA: Just a couple of sticky warriors.

589
00:37:33,742 --> 00:37:35,267
ASHLEY: No, Grog!

590
00:37:35,267 --> 00:37:44,954
MATT: Just as a breeze blows a bit of a dust cloud
through, which coats your sticky hands with heavy

591
00:37:44,954 --> 00:37:51,118
desert sand. You chew for a minute and feel the
crunch of granules inside your mouth where you

592
00:37:51,118 --> 00:37:53,217
inhaled. (crunching)

593
00:37:53,217 --> 00:37:55,181
TRAVIS: Jug goes away.

594
00:37:55,181 --> 00:37:58,188
MATT: Back to you guys. You were looking for the
other entrance?

595
00:37:58,188 --> 00:37:59,305
LAURA: Yeah, up top.

596
00:37:59,305 --> 00:38:00,290
MATT: Investigation check.

597
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:05,030
LAURA: Both of us are looking for it. We're flying
up. Can you fly? So, we can fly up. I was going to

598
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:09,037
help you look for it because I figure you have a
better ability to collapse it than I do.

599
00:38:09,094 --> 00:38:10,779
LIAM: What form are you going to take?

600
00:38:10,779 --> 00:38:12,354
LAURA: A goldfish!

601
00:38:12,354 --> 00:38:23,585
MARISHA: You could hold me in your hands. I've got
about 30 seconds. Just to fly up? Can I ride

602
00:38:23,585 --> 00:38:25,513
side-saddle with you?

603
00:38:25,513 --> 00:38:29,607
LAURA: Of course you can, yes! Put your arms
around me, Keyleth.

604
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:33,823
MARISHA: Okay! Your abs are nice, Vex!

605
00:38:33,823 --> 00:38:35,330
LAURA: I know, I work out a lot.

606
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:37,641
MARISHA: Have you been working out over the past
year? Wow.

607
00:38:37,641 --> 00:38:41,990
MATT: So, who's helming the investigation of this?
And you're aiding her, so go ahead and take it

608
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:43,713
with advantage.

609
00:38:43,713 --> 00:38:49,116
LAURA: Same thing. 21.

610
00:38:49,116 --> 00:38:56,399
MATT: All righty. I left on my collapsing music.

611
00:38:56,399 --> 00:38:59,542
TRAVIS: They die.

612
00:38:59,542 --> 00:39:04,748
MATT: So, as you glance around and do a pass over
the next 20 minutes or so. It's as fast as you

613
00:39:04,748 --> 00:39:09,146
can, but it takes you a while to scan and get a
feel for it. You do see what looks to be, because

614
00:39:09,146 --> 00:39:15,930
you felt the wind was coming through from the
interior, you see a small well-like crevasse where

615
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:23,189
the rocks have collapsed inward. You can see,
glancing over the top, the dark, five,

616
00:39:23,189 --> 00:39:26,334
six-foot-wide hole that leads deeper into the
mountain.

617
00:39:26,334 --> 00:39:28,920
LAURA: I hover down near it, but don't get off the
broom.

618
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:35,890
MARISHA: I lean over, I Druidcraft a pebble, toss
it in the hole.

619
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:41,228
MATT: Don't hear it.

620
00:39:41,228 --> 00:39:43,802
LAURA: Oracle arrow down the hole.

621
00:39:43,802 --> 00:39:47,238
MATT: Okay! Your vision watches as it--

622
00:39:47,238 --> 00:39:50,436
LAURA: Oh, wait! Can she set the end of it on
fire?

623
00:39:50,436 --> 00:39:51,514
MARISHA: Yeah!

624
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:58,011
MATT: Okay, the arrow now, burning, it leads you
into this dark space. It lights up the interior.

625
00:39:58,011 --> 00:40:02,646
The arrow gets about maybe 60 feet before it hits
a rock and shatters.

626
00:40:02,646 --> 00:40:03,968
LAURA: Aww.

627
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:08,516
MATT: It's not straight down. It has a series of
platforms, and it looks like it was designed to be

628
00:40:08,516 --> 00:40:14,927
climbed down, so it's a bit zig-zaggy. It maybe
went 50, 60 feet and it hits a platform and

629
00:40:14,927 --> 00:40:20,394
shatters. You lose your vision. But it does appear
to be a sizable tunnel used for entry.

630
00:40:20,394 --> 00:40:22,595
LAURA: Let's just fucking collapse it.

631
00:40:22,595 --> 00:40:23,510
MARISHA: All right!

632
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:28,077
LAURA: Well, just you fucking collapse because I
can't do shit to this thing.

633
00:40:28,077 --> 00:40:34,943
MARISHA: Can I be like, all right! I want to see
if I can do this, like, cool maneuver. I'm going

634
00:40:34,943 --> 00:40:41,708
to try to balance on the broom, and then jump off
the broom and go Keyteor and go into the--

635
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:44,432
LAURA: Into it, <i>into</i> it?! Or just around it so
you collapse the--

636
00:40:44,432 --> 00:40:45,595
MARISHA: Nah!

637
00:40:45,595 --> 00:40:48,702
LAURA: Oh, god, Keyleth!

638
00:40:48,702 --> 00:40:55,459
MATT: You watch as she leaps and-- cloud of dust.
There is no sign she impacted, she's just gone.

639
00:40:55,459 --> 00:40:57,026
You just see the side of the mountain.

640
00:40:57,026 --> 00:41:02,332
LAURA: Fuck! Fuck! I get out the rope of
entanglement and hover close to the surface and

641
00:41:02,332 --> 00:41:04,301
start hanging the rope down.

642
00:41:04,301 --> 00:41:09,317
MATT: You glance in the inside with what little
bit of daylight is ricocheting off of the stone

643
00:41:09,317 --> 00:41:16,393
interior. You can see the edges of Keyleth's
elemental form swimming through the rock. Because

644
00:41:16,393 --> 00:41:17,710
she can do that.

645
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:20,129
LAURA: That's fucking crazy.

646
00:41:20,129 --> 00:41:21,498
MARISHA: It's like Whac-A-Mole!

647
00:41:21,498 --> 00:41:24,336
LAURA: Careful of traps, though, Keyleth, because
I'm sure there's something in there.

648
00:41:24,336 --> 00:41:25,327
MARISHA: All right.

649
00:41:25,327 --> 00:41:27,803
TALIESIN: How's it going down there? Have you
found it yet?

650
00:41:27,803 --> 00:41:29,178
LAURA: Up here?

651
00:41:29,178 --> 00:41:30,133
TALIESIN: Yes.

652
00:41:30,133 --> 00:41:32,935
LAURA: Fabulous. Our friend, Keyleth, is amazing.

653
00:41:32,935 --> 00:41:34,210
TALIESIN: She jumped in, didn't she?

654
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:35,260
LAURA: Yes, she did.

655
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:41,630
MARISHA: I'm going to Earth Glide to the bottom
and then peek my earthy face out of the top, see

656
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:42,932
if I can see down.

657
00:41:42,932 --> 00:41:45,484
MATT: Are you following the actual path?

658
00:41:45,484 --> 00:41:51,358
MARISHA: Yeah. I'll try to be conscious to make
sure I don't hit anything that looks precarious.

659
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:54,690
MATT: Make an investigation check.

660
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:57,843
LAURA: Don't hit any traps!

661
00:41:57,843 --> 00:42:05,633
MARISHA: All right! Looking for traps! That's
okay, 15.

662
00:42:05,633 --> 00:42:12,137
MATT: 15. Okay. You get about a third of the way
down, and you realize that one of the platforms

663
00:42:12,137 --> 00:42:19,713
that you can land on has, uncharacteristically, a
softer cushion to it. Everything else is just

664
00:42:19,713 --> 00:42:21,583
stone slabs. This one has almost--

665
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:23,062
SAM: Waterbed.

666
00:42:23,062 --> 00:42:33,913
MATT: Yeah! (laughs) Like a spring air mattress,
it's crazy. No, it's like a woven, dried palm

667
00:42:33,913 --> 00:42:36,393
frond-like cloth that's rested over it.

668
00:42:36,393 --> 00:42:43,032
SAM: I'm sure it's nothing. Probably nothing. Just
leave it.

669
00:42:43,032 --> 00:42:49,980
MARISHA: Just a drop-through? Can I, like-- fuck.

670
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:53,442
LAURA: Don't fuck with anything, Keyleth. Just
collapse it!

671
00:42:53,442 --> 00:42:56,526
MARISHA: I found, like a, it might be a roof or--

672
00:42:56,526 --> 00:42:58,479
TRAVIS: Yeah, I bet Clarota's in there.

673
00:42:58,479 --> 00:43:04,916
MARISHA: What? Piranhas? I don't know if piranhas
are in rocks, but there might be something else in

674
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:08,739
there. There might be piranhas. Oh, I'll avoid
it.

675
00:43:08,739 --> 00:43:16,824
MATT: Okay. You continue southward, scooting. You
can sense the very exterior of the wall that leads

676
00:43:16,824 --> 00:43:21,431
to this path, so you're staying away from it as
you glide through the rock and earth. Eventually,

677
00:43:21,431 --> 00:43:27,504
you come close to the very top, breaching the dome
that leads down into the chamber where you had

678
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:32,207
your battle naught but an hour ago. As you poke
your face through, you're looking down, you can

679
00:43:32,207 --> 00:43:39,330
see the dark sphere there, hovering. You can see
the large pyramid structure below it, probably

680
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:47,127
about 60 feet below you. You can see the entrance
to the tunnel that leads into here. There is a

681
00:43:47,127 --> 00:43:54,425
small ladder up along the wall that previously you
didn't notice because of the lack of light and

682
00:43:54,425 --> 00:43:58,158
attention to the ceiling portion. But people were
either climbing up into or climbing down from.

683
00:43:58,158 --> 00:43:59,715
LAURA: What do you see, Keyleth?

684
00:43:59,715 --> 00:44:03,418
MARISHA: There's a ladder, man, there's some very
innovative people.

685
00:44:03,418 --> 00:44:05,702
Yeah, these are very innovative cultists.

686
00:44:05,702 --> 00:44:10,289
LAURA: Wait, you're looking down at the ziggurat?

687
00:44:10,289 --> 00:44:13,685
MARISHA: Yeah! Hey, Pike and Grog, you guys did an
excellent job.

688
00:44:13,685 --> 00:44:15,125
ASHLEY and TRAVIS: Oh thanks!

689
00:44:15,125 --> 00:44:16,519
TRAVIS: It really means a lot.

690
00:44:16,519 --> 00:44:17,909
LAURA: Get the fuck away from it, Keyleth!

691
00:44:17,909 --> 00:44:19,044
MARISHA: Okay! Good idea!

692
00:44:19,044 --> 00:44:23,094
MATT: By the way, it's fantastic. You all hear
through it (earth elemental grumbling).

693
00:44:23,094 --> 00:44:24,326
TRAVIS: Oh, right, yeah!

694
00:44:24,326 --> 00:44:27,650
MATT: The grumbling, low voice of an earth
elemental speaking to you through the earring.

695
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:29,668
LAURA: We still don't know how far that field
goes.

696
00:44:29,668 --> 00:44:31,914
If you turn into Keyleth again, you're fucked!

697
00:44:31,914 --> 00:44:33,460
MARISHA: (unintelligible grumbling)

698
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:34,871
LAURA: Get the fuck out!

699
00:44:34,871 --> 00:44:38,952
MARISHA: I try and say, like, well, I know it's
about 180 feet because I tested before, so I'm

700
00:44:38,952 --> 00:44:43,784
trying to be conscious of it. And then I back up a
little bit, and I go over to where that tunnel

701
00:44:43,784 --> 00:44:50,652
was, and I start collapsing it down. As I work my
way up, I'm going (impacts).

702
00:44:50,652 --> 00:44:57,496
MATT: Easily enough. You go by and you start
kicking through the tunnel as you go. You can

703
00:44:57,496 --> 00:45:04,384
sense near proximity where any of the various weak
points are in the stone. Systematically go through

704
00:45:04,384 --> 00:45:08,850
it, collapse it, piece by piece, until eventually
most of the tunnel is useless and unusable.

705
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:10,343
MARISHA: It's like a platformer.

706
00:45:10,343 --> 00:45:14,363
MATT: How long can you maintain your wild shape?

707
00:45:14,363 --> 00:45:18,965
MARISHA: Half of my level, or something like
that?

708
00:45:18,965 --> 00:45:20,244
MATT: Oh, you're fine, then.

709
00:45:20,244 --> 00:45:24,646
MARISHA: Or it's a third of my level? Still
several hours.

710
00:45:24,646 --> 00:45:29,861
MATT: You emerge a little over an hour or so of
doing this. You emerge from the top. You watch as

711
00:45:29,861 --> 00:45:34,128
Keyleth (rock impacts), looking like a large
version of Fantastic Four's Thing.

712
00:45:34,128 --> 00:45:37,641
LAURA: I'm holding my rope for her. You don't--
okay.

713
00:45:37,641 --> 00:45:46,401
MATT: It appears to be taken care of. All of the
entrances have been collapsed. There's no way that

714
00:45:46,401 --> 00:45:50,426
you can imagine any average person can find their
way into this.

715
00:45:50,426 --> 00:45:56,411
LAURA: Good job. Are you going to stay that way,
or are you turning back into you so that I can get

716
00:45:56,411 --> 00:45:58,247
you on the broom?

717
00:45:58,247 --> 00:45:59,903
MARISHA: (guttural noise of agreement)

718
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:02,785
(laughter)

719
00:46:02,785 --> 00:46:05,338
LAURA: You can still talk, right? You just sound
low.

720
00:46:05,338 --> 00:46:06,543
TRAVIS: No.

721
00:46:06,543 --> 00:46:12,316
MARISHA: (guttural gibberish) I speak a different
language that I still don't think anyone has--

722
00:46:12,316 --> 00:46:19,033
MATT: You can-- you maintain your mental acuity
and statistics when you're in there.

723
00:46:19,033 --> 00:46:22,252
MARISHA: I don't know. We've gone back and forth
on it!

724
00:46:22,252 --> 00:46:26,622
TALIESIN: It never occurred to you to speak
Common. Why would I do that?

725
00:46:26,622 --> 00:46:36,075
MATT: The texture and timbre of your voice. You
can hear words, but it's almost like words being

726
00:46:36,075 --> 00:46:38,120
made by slamming rocks together.

727
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:39,216
LAURA: Crazy.

728
00:46:39,216 --> 00:46:40,958
MARISHA: Not that different from my normal
speech.

729
00:46:40,958 --> 00:46:48,330
LIAM: I won't bore you with the details, but while
all that was going on, while they were searching

730
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:53,556
and they were destroying things, Vax wandered a
hundred feet out and sat down and did a little

731
00:46:53,556 --> 00:46:58,532
talking to the mother of ravens, and basically
said, not expecting an answer:

732
00:46:58,532 --> 00:47:01,534
This is it, isn't it?

733
00:47:01,534 --> 00:47:05,522
MATT: Make a wisdom check.

734
00:47:05,522 --> 00:47:12,766
ALL: Ooh.

735
00:47:12,766 --> 00:47:14,631
LIAM: Not good. 13.

736
00:47:14,631 --> 00:47:21,407
MATT: 13? That's enough. As you sit there in
silence with your eyes closed, beseeching the

737
00:47:21,407 --> 00:47:29,162
attention of your patron, which seemingly wasn't
present when you attempted to in the proximity of

738
00:47:29,162 --> 00:47:43,039
this doorway. The familiar soft, omnipresent voice
creeps into your psyche as she tells you, "It

739
00:47:43,039 --> 00:47:58,102
"seems that the bender of fate is feeling the tug
of destiny. It's almost as if you're coming

740
00:47:58,102 --> 00:48:09,930
"towards me. If you sense this path is the right
one, follow your instincts.

741
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:14,378
"Perhaps we'll meet soon enough."

742
00:48:14,378 --> 00:48:19,152
LIAM: I will see you soon.

743
00:48:19,152 --> 00:48:29,875
MATT: All right. So you guys reconvene.

744
00:48:29,875 --> 00:48:34,918
LAURA: Hey, guys. How's it going?

745
00:48:34,918 --> 00:48:37,411
LIAM: Hey, guys!

746
00:48:37,411 --> 00:48:40,195
LAURA: What should we do?

747
00:48:40,195 --> 00:48:42,724
TRAVIS: You should try the local fruit. It's
delicious.

748
00:48:42,724 --> 00:48:44,351
ASHLEY: Yeah, you guys should try it.

749
00:48:44,351 --> 00:48:47,411
TALIESIN: I pick up a piece of the local fruit and
smell it.

750
00:48:47,411 --> 00:49:07,326
MATT: How do I describe the smell? It's
reminiscent of discovering old lemon juice that

751
00:49:07,326 --> 00:49:15,034
has grown sticky on a surface, like a dark
mahogany wood surface. Kind of like a bar floor.

752
00:49:15,034 --> 00:49:17,320
We'll go with that.

753
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,749
TALIESIN: No, I don't think I will.

754
00:49:19,749 --> 00:49:21,855
TRAVIS: It belies its true flavor.

755
00:49:21,855 --> 00:49:23,656
TALIESIN: I don't think it does.

756
00:49:23,656 --> 00:49:29,555
MARISHA: This looks like it's rotten from the
landscape. It looks like it's all gone bad.

757
00:49:29,555 --> 00:49:30,917
Has it gone bad?

758
00:49:30,917 --> 00:49:32,912
MATT: Make a nature check.

759
00:49:32,912 --> 00:49:34,761
TRAVIS: Oh, great.

760
00:49:34,761 --> 00:49:38,709
MARISHA: 25.

761
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:45,328
MATT: No. There are elements that have gone bad on
the ground and have been covered by sand

762
00:49:45,328 --> 00:49:47,422
as winds blow through.

763
00:49:47,422 --> 00:49:49,288
TALIESIN: Naturally awful.

764
00:49:49,288 --> 00:49:56,895
MATT: It's like desert noni. It's extremely
healthy and has a lot of practical medicinal use.

765
00:49:56,895 --> 00:50:04,408
In fact, it's traded specifically for its use in
various herb pouches.

766
00:50:04,408 --> 00:50:08,214
MARISHA: Does it have a name?

767
00:50:08,214 --> 00:50:10,106
MATT: Yes.

768
00:50:10,106 --> 00:50:13,945
LIAM: Like that giant, stinking flower. Grog took
a bite of the giant, stinking flower.

769
00:50:13,945 --> 00:50:16,370
MATT: A vafall fruit.

770
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:20,853
MARISHA: A what?

771
00:50:20,853 --> 00:50:23,436
TALIESIN: Did it alter Grog's stats on any level?

772
00:50:23,436 --> 00:50:24,470
MATT: No.

773
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:26,888
TALIESIN: Then it's not that healthy, is it? It's
like agave.

774
00:50:26,888 --> 00:50:28,995
MARISHA: Vafall?

775
00:50:28,995 --> 00:50:31,150
MATT: Listen to Sam. He's got the pronunciation.

776
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:33,236
LIAM: I will eat you with a lovely chianti and
some vafall.

777
00:50:33,236 --> 00:50:35,778
ALL: Vafall.

778
00:50:35,778 --> 00:50:37,269
ASHLEY: Should we take some, then?

779
00:50:37,269 --> 00:50:39,800
LAURA: Make some medicine?

780
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,852
TALIESIN: You could try to bake with it. Maybe
it's bakeable.

781
00:50:42,852 --> 00:50:47,224
MARISHA: It makes a really good salve. It's good
for sunburns.

782
00:50:47,224 --> 00:50:49,144
LIAM: Or shoving in somebody's bed.

783
00:50:49,144 --> 00:50:52,479
TRAVIS: How do we get back to Whitestone?

784
00:50:52,479 --> 00:50:56,885
TALIESIN: Is there a tree that this fruit was
coming off of?

785
00:50:56,885 --> 00:50:57,843
MATT: Yes.

786
00:50:57,843 --> 00:51:00,167
TALIESIN: I point at the tree.

787
00:51:00,167 --> 00:51:06,406
MATT: The ones on the outskirts of the mountain
range are small, but the deeper into the valleys

788
00:51:06,406 --> 00:51:10,431
and ravines between the large spire-like
mountains, you do find a few that are probably

789
00:51:10,431 --> 00:51:12,301
large enough to utilize through your spell.

790
00:51:12,301 --> 00:51:13,486
MARISHA: Yeah, I can do that.

791
00:51:13,486 --> 00:51:15,015
LAURA: Tary, are you coming back to Whitestone?

792
00:51:15,015 --> 00:51:21,942
SAM: I have to, yes. I have to repair Doty, and
also find some new recruits. I think there are

793
00:51:21,942 --> 00:51:23,366
some in Whitestone, right?

794
00:51:23,366 --> 00:51:24,854
TALIESIN: You're really going through with this?

795
00:51:24,854 --> 00:51:30,547
SAM: Of course. It's my destiny. I met you all to
become an adventurer, and now I'm bringing my

796
00:51:30,547 --> 00:51:34,833
knowledge back to my people. It's like it was
written in a book.

797
00:51:34,833 --> 00:51:37,982
LAURA: A very good book.

798
00:51:37,982 --> 00:51:39,387
TRAVIS: Yeah, you're writing a book!

799
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:41,524
SAM: I am.

800
00:51:41,524 --> 00:51:46,107
ASHLEY: And not only that, you're going to be the
leader of a band of adventurers.

801
00:51:46,107 --> 00:51:48,861
TRAVIS: Are you a colonel, a general, a private?

802
00:51:48,861 --> 00:51:54,782
SAM: I hadn't thought of that. You know what?
There's no leader of Vox Machina, so maybe there

803
00:51:54,782 --> 00:52:00,517
won't be in the Darrington Brigade. Well, besides
you. You're unofficially--

804
00:52:00,517 --> 00:52:02,488
you're definitely the treasurer.

805
00:52:02,488 --> 00:52:06,209
LIAM: I'm behind her doing this.

806
00:52:06,209 --> 00:52:07,889
TRAVIS: Yeah, rolling eyes.

807
00:52:07,889 --> 00:52:10,658
LAURA: Lionel?

808
00:52:10,658 --> 00:52:13,697
MATT: His mouth is filled with fruit.

809
00:52:13,697 --> 00:52:17,391
(laughter)

810
00:52:17,391 --> 00:52:19,252
LAURA: Is it good? How are you doing?

811
00:52:19,252 --> 00:52:23,077
MATT: "It's getting really heavy. This is really
heavy."

812
00:52:23,077 --> 00:52:31,113
LAURA: Yeah. Are you coming back to Whitestone, as
well? Scanlan, I mean Aes-- is he coming back?

813
00:52:31,113 --> 00:52:33,647
SAM: I suppose we'll need him for now, yes.

814
00:52:33,647 --> 00:52:34,808
LAURA: Okay.

815
00:52:34,808 --> 00:52:39,936
TALIESIN: I still like the idea of perhaps the two
of you working together. You could talk to Scanlan

816
00:52:39,936 --> 00:52:42,035
about it and see if he'd be all right--

817
00:52:42,035 --> 00:52:43,875
(laughter)

818
00:52:43,875 --> 00:52:46,213
TALIESIN: I'm never going to get bored of this.
I'm never going to get bored of this!

819
00:52:46,213 --> 00:52:48,190
LIAM: Scanlan, what do you think?

820
00:52:48,190 --> 00:52:53,920
TRAVIS: That was a fucking awesome
physical reaction.

821
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,646
LIAM: At least in the short term.

822
00:52:55,646 --> 00:53:04,077
SAM: You're suggesting that I, Scanlan Shorthalt,
bequeath my employee Chod to this gentleman here?

823
00:53:04,077 --> 00:53:10,697
You mean me, Taryon Darrington? You mean Chod
could join my brigade?

824
00:53:10,697 --> 00:53:13,067
Well, yes. I guess that's what they're talking
about.

825
00:53:13,067 --> 00:53:16,157
Well, I don't see why not. He's very capable and
strong.

826
00:53:16,157 --> 00:53:20,729
Yes, and I won't have much use for him for a
while, so if you'd like to take him with your

827
00:53:20,729 --> 00:53:21,930
brigade, you can.

828
00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:27,944
Well, I'm not going to say no to a fellow member
of Vox Machina now, am I?

829
00:53:27,944 --> 00:53:29,076
No, you're not.

830
00:53:29,076 --> 00:53:30,576
No, I'm not.

831
00:53:30,576 --> 00:53:31,938
TRAVIS: Yes.

832
00:53:31,938 --> 00:53:38,397
MATT: "I don't see any similarities."

833
00:53:38,397 --> 00:53:40,592
(laughter)

834
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:44,771
TALIESIN: That's everything I wanted. I'm good.

835
00:53:44,771 --> 00:53:45,898
LAURA: Through the tree, then?

836
00:53:45,898 --> 00:53:46,860
MARISHA: Through the tree.

837
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:54,926
MATT: All right, so as you finish concentrating on
the outside of one of these large, 15 to

838
00:53:54,926 --> 00:53:59,773
20-foot-tall, leafless, fruit-bearing trees in the
center of the Smoldercrown Forest, the doorway

839
00:53:59,773 --> 00:54:06,293
shifts open, revealing on the opposite side the
dark, sunless night of Whitestone.

840
00:54:06,293 --> 00:54:11,245
MARISHA: I pick a blossom from the tree on the way
out.

841
00:54:11,245 --> 00:54:12,682
LIAM: I pull two of the fruits.

842
00:54:12,682 --> 00:54:26,063
MATT: Okay. You guys arrive. It's early evening.
You can see the windows of nearby homes, shops,

843
00:54:26,063 --> 00:54:31,950
and various structures near the square are
beginning to glow from the interior light of small

844
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:37,661
lanterns and candles. In the distance, you can see
the perimeter beacons being put along the castle

845
00:54:37,661 --> 00:54:43,601
walls on the exterior of Castle Whitestone. You're
back home.

846
00:54:43,601 --> 00:54:46,293
LAURA: Let's gather our troops.

847
00:54:46,293 --> 00:54:47,734
TALIESIN: Make thy way to the castle.

848
00:54:47,734 --> 00:54:49,054
LAURA: Find out what they've learned.

849
00:54:49,054 --> 00:54:56,087
MATT: All right. At which point, Lionel keeps
asking,

850
00:54:56,087 --> 00:54:59,774
"Can I put him down yet? Can I put him down?"

851
00:54:59,774 --> 00:55:01,069
SAM: Not quite yet.

852
00:55:01,069 --> 00:55:02,641
TALIESIN: We're going to take him to the castle.

853
00:55:02,641 --> 00:55:04,909
SAM: Change arms.

854
00:55:04,909 --> 00:55:15,959
MATT: "Ooh! That helps a lot." You make your way
to the castle.

855
00:55:15,959 --> 00:55:21,409
Doty's delivered to the workshop. Taryon?

856
00:55:21,409 --> 00:55:22,794
SAM: Stays there.

857
00:55:22,794 --> 00:55:23,756
MATT: Okay.

858
00:55:23,756 --> 00:55:26,350
(laughter)

859
00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:29,448
TALIESIN: We'll keep you informed.

860
00:55:29,448 --> 00:55:30,989
SAM: Thank you.

861
00:55:30,989 --> 00:55:36,358
MATT: All right, so you guys now have the run of
the castle. What do you wish to do?

862
00:55:36,358 --> 00:55:42,512
LAURA: We asked Cassandra to gather people to
study the Shadowfell as soon as we did the oracle

863
00:55:42,512 --> 00:55:46,262
arrow last time, so it would probably be smart to
find out what

864
00:55:46,262 --> 00:55:48,819
they've learned before we make our plans.

865
00:55:48,819 --> 00:55:56,701
MATT: Okay. As you approach Cassandra, at this
hour, she currently has a recently steeped,

866
00:55:56,701 --> 00:56:03,296
still-steaming cup of tea resting on the table,
towards the window side, the front window side, of

867
00:56:03,296 --> 00:56:09,804
the general dining hall area of the castle where
you usually eat your supper. She's facing away

868
00:56:09,804 --> 00:56:13,842
from the table and has a thick robe over her and
has the tea and is in the process of reading

869
00:56:13,842 --> 00:56:18,306
through books. Her hair's pulled up tightly, and
some of it's a mess in front of her face. She's

870
00:56:18,306 --> 00:56:22,858
very much in work mode. She's poring through
books, and as soon as you enter, she reaches over

871
00:56:22,858 --> 00:56:35,752
for her cup of tea. "Oh. Hello, everyone." She
gets herself a little more presentable. "I've got

872
00:56:35,752 --> 00:56:43,295
"the assistance of Eskil Ryndarien. Everyone else
seems to be a bit busy at the moment, but Allura

873
00:56:43,295 --> 00:56:45,629
"is doing the best she can research on her end, as
well."

874
00:56:45,629 --> 00:56:49,033
TALIESIN: We're going to need everybody. It's
worse than we could have imagined.

875
00:56:49,033 --> 00:56:52,137
LAURA: And we have far less time than we would
have imagined.

876
00:56:52,137 --> 00:56:54,219
MATT: "How much time do we have?"

877
00:56:54,219 --> 00:56:57,695
TALIESIN: This has to be taken care of
immediately.

878
00:56:57,695 --> 00:56:59,541
LIAM: Things are happening now.

879
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:05,763
MATT: "Well, you have far better means of
acquiring these people than I do. I can merely

880
00:57:05,763 --> 00:57:07,381
"send missives and requests."

881
00:57:07,381 --> 00:57:13,850
TALIESIN: We're going to send word out. I'm going
to take out my flask and put it on the table. Sit

882
00:57:13,850 --> 00:57:15,524
down for a moment.

883
00:57:15,524 --> 00:57:17,772
MATT: She takes it and adds it to her tea.

884
00:57:17,772 --> 00:57:19,393
LAURA: Is Ryndarien here?

885
00:57:19,393 --> 00:57:26,078
MATT: "He is. He's currently inspecting the
ziggurat again. He's setting his notes up where he

886
00:57:26,078 --> 00:57:31,286
"previously set up research quarters during the
incursion of the Conclave."

887
00:57:31,286 --> 00:57:33,158
LAURA: We need to get everyone away from it.

888
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:34,619
MARISHA: Where's Allura?

889
00:57:34,619 --> 00:57:37,440
MATT: "She's in Emon. She's still part of the
council there."

890
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,492
TALIESIN: We have to get her here immediately.

891
00:57:39,492 --> 00:57:41,395
LIAM: Is Gilmore still in town?

892
00:57:41,395 --> 00:57:43,272
MATT: "No, he's back in Emon."

893
00:57:43,272 --> 00:57:44,508
LIAM: He left for good?

894
00:57:44,508 --> 00:57:49,041
LAURA: I'm going to run down to the ziggurat and
try to get Eskil Ryndarien away from it and warn

895
00:57:49,041 --> 00:57:51,060
everyone to stay away from it.

896
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:52,024
MATT: Okay.

897
00:57:52,024 --> 00:57:58,546
TALIESIN: Let's double-check that armor for any
weird influences it may have, to make sure it is what

898
00:57:58,546 --> 00:58:04,450
it seems to be, which is ornamental, with a bit of
magic. Let's make sure that the captain of

899
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:09,758
whatever guard is on shift down by the ziggurat is
wearing it, and is aware that he's there to

900
00:58:09,758 --> 00:58:11,487
befuddle the enemy.

901
00:58:11,487 --> 00:58:16,197
MATT: Okay. You make your way down there, and you
can see it's still fairly dark in that chamber.

902
00:58:16,197 --> 00:58:20,347
Most of the lights have been snuffed except for a
few torches that are set around the central

903
00:58:20,347 --> 00:58:24,863
platform that was built about mid-height on the
ziggurat, where you guys had the council meeting

904
00:58:24,863 --> 00:58:28,618
with Raishan that one time, and where most of the
research is being done there. Up top, you see a

905
00:58:28,618 --> 00:58:34,084
number of guards, the Pale Guard are assigned to
keep watch. You see Jecht, the manservant of the

906
00:58:34,084 --> 00:58:43,142
Realmseer Eskil there, as well. Currently, you see
Eskil Ryndarien is spreading out his thick scrolls

907
00:58:43,142 --> 00:58:47,954
and books, and they're all across the big central
wooden table, and he has his thick spectacles on,

908
00:58:47,954 --> 00:58:53,670
and he has a number of candles already set up, and
he's deep into getting his space prepped and

909
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:57,926
acquiring whatever information he'd put away since
the investigation was put on hold.

910
00:58:57,926 --> 00:58:59,080
LAURA: Eskil?

911
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:06,398
MATT: "Yes? Oh, it has been some time, Lady
Vex'ahlia.

912
00:59:06,398 --> 00:59:09,153
"I've heard you've come up in the world."

913
00:59:09,153 --> 00:59:11,526
LAURA: Oh, yes. I'm a lady now.

914
00:59:11,526 --> 00:59:15,459
MATT: "Wondrous. Yes. What do I have the honor?"

915
00:59:15,459 --> 00:59:19,554
LAURA: Well, I hate to be the bearer of bad news,
but I'm afraid

916
00:59:19,554 --> 00:59:22,909
being down here isn't safe anymore.

917
00:59:22,909 --> 00:59:25,896
MATT: "Right, so you brought me all the way out
here, and now I can't do my work? That's great.

918
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:29,226
"No, that's par for the course. It's basically most
of my life."

919
00:59:29,226 --> 00:59:37,264
LAURA: Plenty of work up top, away from this orb
of death. It's very dangerous.

920
00:59:37,264 --> 00:59:41,401
MATT: "Oh! You're right. I didn't know that. I've
only spent six months with the thing!"

921
00:59:41,401 --> 00:59:47,352
LAURA: We've discovered it's a gateway, and things
can come through it, and there might be armies

922
00:59:47,352 --> 00:59:51,475
coming through because we just fought somebody on
the other side of another ziggurat.

923
00:59:51,475 --> 00:59:56,514
MATT: "That's preposterous. Siphons only work one
way, my dear. Nothing's coming through there."

924
00:59:56,514 --> 01:00:00,296
LAURA: She changed it. Did you know that siphons
can be changed?

925
01:00:00,296 --> 01:00:02,772
It changed from one color to another.

926
01:00:02,772 --> 01:00:04,233
MATT: "You know this how?"

927
01:00:04,233 --> 01:00:06,092
LAURA: Because I was there to witness it.

928
01:00:06,092 --> 01:00:07,997
MATT: "What, here?"

929
01:00:07,997 --> 01:00:13,271
LAURA: In Ank'harel. And it looks the exact same
as this one.

930
01:00:13,271 --> 01:00:27,941
MATT: He looks you over really intensely. "If what
you believe you saw is indeed another one of these

931
01:00:27,941 --> 01:00:35,347
"siphons, then perhaps we should take a little more
care."

932
01:00:35,347 --> 01:00:37,476
LAURA: I agree.

933
01:00:37,476 --> 01:00:42,634
MATT: "Jecht, please continue. Gather everything.
We're taking this outside."

934
01:00:42,634 --> 01:00:48,415
LAURA: Fabulous. You're so agreeable. I do love
talking to you.

935
01:00:48,415 --> 01:00:56,740
MATT: "Wonderful. Good to know. Goodbye." They
gather up the materials. The Pale Guard escorts

936
01:00:56,740 --> 01:01:00,910
them back into the hallway, and he's now talking
to Jecht off on the side. He goes, "Well, then we

937
01:01:00,910 --> 01:01:06,970
"can go ahead and stage ourselves in the grand
guestroom with the nice big bed. Yes?"

938
01:01:06,970 --> 01:01:09,057
LAURA: The big ornate bed.

939
01:01:09,057 --> 01:01:14,234
MATT: He looks over his shoulder as you say this.
"Oh, you're eavesdropping now, as well.

940
01:01:14,234 --> 01:01:15,425
"That's wondrous."

941
01:01:15,425 --> 01:01:16,735
LAURA: I have wonderful hearing.

942
01:01:16,735 --> 01:01:21,062
MATT: "So I can tell. Yes, the big bed. The one
that helps with my back."

943
01:01:21,062 --> 01:01:26,689
LAURA: Yes, that's terrible. Can you look at this
armor really fast and make sure that it's not

944
01:01:26,689 --> 01:01:28,772
actually cursed or anything?

945
01:01:28,772 --> 01:01:31,592
MATT: "Looks fine to me!" Keeps walking.

946
01:01:31,592 --> 01:01:36,897
LAURA: Was it cursed, or anything, when you looked
at it?

947
01:01:36,897 --> 01:01:38,230
SAM: I don't know.

948
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:40,331
MATT: Did not appear to be cursed from your glance
at it.

949
01:01:40,331 --> 01:01:48,052
LAURA: Would he have known from the Identify spell
if it was cursed? Great. Well.

950
01:01:48,052 --> 01:01:50,305
MARISHA: Can Keyleth go talk to Percy?

951
01:01:50,305 --> 01:01:52,572
TALIESIN: I'm in Cassandra's room, still.

952
01:01:52,572 --> 01:02:00,179
MARISHA: Keyleth waits for Percy. Hang on. I can
go talk with Cassandra, as well.

953
01:02:00,179 --> 01:02:03,282
MATT: Unless you're having a closed conversation.

954
01:02:03,282 --> 01:02:11,636
TALIESIN: Just ten seconds of it. We'll see how
this goes. Have a bit of that flask.

955
01:02:11,636 --> 01:02:15,810
MATT: She's already poured some into her tea.

956
01:02:15,810 --> 01:02:24,616
TALIESIN: We've found a second ziggurat. We found
a cult that is moving things through it. The cult

957
01:02:24,616 --> 01:02:33,968
was being led by Delilah Briarwood.

958
01:02:33,968 --> 01:02:45,517
MATT: The silence, the stark absence of sound, is
completely sundered by the sound of shattering

959
01:02:45,517 --> 01:02:56,271
porcelainware. The tea that she had recently
barely sipped on is now shattered and spilled

960
01:02:56,271 --> 01:03:03,801
across the ground. She stands there, her hand open
as it slowly curls back. She stares off into the

961
01:03:03,801 --> 01:03:06,777
distance, clenching her fist very tightly.

962
01:03:06,777 --> 01:03:12,438
TALIESIN: She escaped into the ziggurat, so she's
no longer on this plane of existence, but some

963
01:03:12,438 --> 01:03:18,869
form of her, whether it's undead or otherwise,
we're going to need to put it down again.

964
01:03:18,869 --> 01:03:21,950
MATT: "Yes, we do."

965
01:03:21,950 --> 01:03:28,037
TALIESIN: I wanted you to hear it from me. There
will be no running this time.

966
01:03:28,037 --> 01:03:30,055
MATT: "No running."

967
01:03:30,055 --> 01:03:31,686
TALIESIN: Not from me.

968
01:03:31,686 --> 01:03:35,645
MATT: "But you'll take care of her?"

969
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:40,373
TALIESIN: This is the end of her. I will be there
to see it.

970
01:03:40,373 --> 01:03:46,052
MATT: "She's escaped death once already. Who knows
how many times she has before.

971
01:03:46,052 --> 01:03:48,773
"You have to end it."

972
01:03:48,773 --> 01:03:53,337
TALIESIN: We will discover what she did.

973
01:03:53,337 --> 01:03:59,230
MATT: "Don't destroy her body. Destroy everything
she is."

974
01:03:59,230 --> 01:04:03,346
TALIESIN: If we can't kill her, we will entrap her
forever.

975
01:04:03,346 --> 01:04:09,188
MATT: "Shatter the soul. Whatever it takes. End
her, brother."

976
01:04:09,188 --> 01:04:12,593
TALIESIN: I know. I shall.

977
01:04:12,593 --> 01:04:18,215
MATT: She takes the flask.

978
01:04:18,215 --> 01:04:26,887
TALIESIN: I wanted you to hear it from me so you
could compose yourself when

979
01:04:26,887 --> 01:04:29,153
other people begin to tell you.

980
01:04:29,153 --> 01:04:35,728
MATT: "I need a moment alone, please."

981
01:04:35,728 --> 01:04:43,169
TALIESIN: They're going to need us to be the
strongest. I have faith in you. I'll leave you to

982
01:04:43,169 --> 01:04:44,771
it. I'm so sorry.

983
01:04:44,771 --> 01:04:46,488
MATT: "I'm going to be sick."

984
01:04:46,488 --> 01:04:50,091
TALIESIN: Yes. I'm going to leave her to her room
and shut the door.

985
01:04:50,091 --> 01:04:52,964
MATT: You close the door and there in the hallway,
waiting opposite the door, is Keyleth.

986
01:04:52,964 --> 01:04:54,865
TALIESIN: Hi.

987
01:04:54,865 --> 01:04:57,352
MARISHA: How did that go?

988
01:04:57,352 --> 01:05:00,384
TALIESIN: Honestly, better than I expected.

989
01:05:00,384 --> 01:05:01,399
MARISHA: Yeah.

990
01:05:01,399 --> 01:05:06,223
MATT: At which point, you hear behind the door, a
muffled (retching).

991
01:05:06,223 --> 01:05:13,083
TALIESIN: More sick and less things breaking. I'd
rather her be sick than angry.

992
01:05:13,083 --> 01:05:20,143
MARISHA: You think? I hate being sick. Anger at
least drives you towards something.

993
01:05:20,143 --> 01:05:23,037
TALIESIN: It does not drive de Rolos towards
anything good.

994
01:05:23,037 --> 01:05:31,814
MARISHA: Fair point. I have a crazy thought, and I
needed to run by you. Sorry, didn't mean to hit

995
01:05:31,814 --> 01:05:41,200
you. Okay. I'm excited. All right. We watched the
orb change. She changed the magic in the orb,

996
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:50,306
right? We just spent a year making magical orbs
that change in some way, that are all linked to

997
01:05:50,306 --> 01:05:56,197
our city. Clearly, not as powerful as what this
is.

998
01:05:56,197 --> 01:05:58,243
TALIESIN: No, not at all.

999
01:05:58,243 --> 01:06:07,200
MARISHA: But what if-- I don't know. What if she
corrupted something that was already there that

1000
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:18,216
wasn't supposed to be corrupted? What if she can
corrupt more things, like our crisis orbs? I had

1001
01:06:18,216 --> 01:06:22,179
this immediate fear that what if I built something
that was supposed to help--

1002
01:06:22,179 --> 01:06:26,793
TALIESIN: I'm so glad you thought of me when this
came up.

1003
01:06:26,793 --> 01:06:31,949
MARISHA: Well, you helped me build it. Am I crazy
for thinking it? Am I totally off base?

1004
01:06:31,949 --> 01:06:36,245
TALIESIN: I think we're going to be walking a very
fine line of paranoia for the next

1005
01:06:36,245 --> 01:06:38,999
however long.

1006
01:06:38,999 --> 01:06:45,089
MARISHA: Maybe there's something in our own
technology, in our own magic, that can help inform

1007
01:06:45,089 --> 01:06:47,060
us. I don't know.

1008
01:06:47,060 --> 01:06:49,034
TALIESIN: When they get here, we're going to look
at everything.

1009
01:06:49,034 --> 01:06:50,700
MARISHA: All right. We'll sleep on it.

1010
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:55,337
TALIESIN: I think we're going to be fine, but you
did give me some ideas that

1011
01:06:55,337 --> 01:06:56,771
I'm going to think about.

1012
01:06:56,771 --> 01:07:05,712
MARISHA: And those symbols. The necklaces. Druids,
we use similar things

1013
01:07:05,712 --> 01:07:09,458
when we plane shift to other worlds.

1014
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:15,505
TALIESIN: I'm going to take one to the library and
inspect it. I'm going to also see what any of our

1015
01:07:15,505 --> 01:07:19,011
other arcanists think of it. If it's from a cult
that anybody has heard of before.

1016
01:07:19,011 --> 01:07:22,540
MARISHA: I think I can plane shift us there with
it if we don't want to go through the orb.

1017
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:23,726
TALIESIN: Really?

1018
01:07:23,726 --> 01:07:28,762
MARISHA: I think. It seems like very similar
technology. Magic.

1019
01:07:28,762 --> 01:07:30,979
TALIESIN: I'm rubbing off on you.

1020
01:07:30,979 --> 01:07:38,571
MARISHA: Yeah. I don't know. Sleep on it. I'm
going to go think.

1021
01:07:38,571 --> 01:07:47,475
TALIESIN: I have no idea what just happened. Yeah.
I'm going to double-check the orb room just for a

1022
01:07:47,475 --> 01:07:49,314
moment, for my own paranoia.

1023
01:07:49,314 --> 01:07:51,865
MARISHA: The crisis orb room? Actually, I'll go
with him.

1024
01:07:51,865 --> 01:07:57,206
TALIESIN: Just to look, and then I'm going to
start researching that symbol. I'm going to go to

1025
01:07:57,206 --> 01:08:00,327
the library and I'm showing the council
everything.

1026
01:08:00,327 --> 01:08:10,338
MATT: Okay. You speak with the rest of the
standing chamber. You begin to do your research.

1027
01:08:10,338 --> 01:08:13,646
Make a history check.

1028
01:08:13,646 --> 01:08:20,741
MARISHA: Oh, that's good! Take it.

1029
01:08:20,741 --> 01:08:22,270
TALIESIN: 22.

1030
01:08:22,270 --> 01:08:30,693
MATT: 22. You've read through most of the books
here, between you and JB, who's spent some time

1031
01:08:30,693 --> 01:08:38,893
also reading quite a bit. There's no mention of
the symbol itself, and there's very little

1032
01:08:38,893 --> 01:08:46,126
information on the Whispered One, on Vecna. It's
interesting: there's almost a gap in history.

1033
01:08:46,126 --> 01:08:55,683
There are subtle mentions of this figure, this
once-powerful mage that had begun to look into the

1034
01:08:55,683 --> 01:09:06,409
secrets of life, prolonging it. The fabric of
reality. And then it's just missing from history.

1035
01:09:06,409 --> 01:09:19,522
And you recall... all the books that would cover
that time period, you remember hearing stories

1036
01:09:19,522 --> 01:09:26,624
from Allura regarding the Whispered One,
originally. There's no mention.

1037
01:09:26,624 --> 01:09:35,039
TALIESIN: Is it a physical omission from the
books, or is it even that the books that would

1038
01:09:35,039 --> 01:09:41,124
cover it are not here? Books that should cover it
that don't?

1039
01:09:41,124 --> 01:09:49,214
MATT: Books that you feel like should cover it.
Historical recalling of Wildmount, which if you

1040
01:09:49,214 --> 01:09:54,290
recall, based on some of Allura's discussion on
the Whispered One's previous existence as a

1041
01:09:54,290 --> 01:10:02,494
mortal, largely, Vecna's work was done over on the
Wildmount side of Exandria.

1042
01:10:02,494 --> 01:10:04,352
TALIESIN: And there's no--

1043
01:10:04,352 --> 01:10:09,792
MARISHA: Bitch! Sorry. Go on.

1044
01:10:09,792 --> 01:10:11,665
TALIESIN: I don't know what's happening over
here.

1045
01:10:11,665 --> 01:10:12,898
MATT: I don't, either.

1046
01:10:12,898 --> 01:10:18,126
TALIESIN: There's nothing that's simple. Like, the
more I'm looking, I'm looking for

1047
01:10:18,126 --> 01:10:19,617
mention of the symbols--

1048
01:10:19,617 --> 01:10:20,746
MATT: No.

1049
01:10:20,746 --> 01:10:26,175
TALIESIN: Keyleth, you know damn well where I am
right now, I'm sitting in the library reading

1050
01:10:26,175 --> 01:10:29,684
books, so if you have something to say. Oh, wow,
you're going way back.

1051
01:10:29,684 --> 01:10:36,334
MARISHA: I'm looking. I'll meet you in the
library.

1052
01:10:36,334 --> 01:10:38,293
SAM: How to Play Pathfinder.

1053
01:10:38,293 --> 01:10:42,524
(laughter)

1054
01:10:42,524 --> 01:10:44,447
TALIESIN: Is that Hercules Mulligan?

1055
01:10:44,447 --> 01:10:46,681
MARISHA: This is a tiny Hercules Mulligan. I was
looking for him!

1056
01:10:46,681 --> 01:10:51,148
He's been in here the whole time.

1057
01:10:51,148 --> 01:10:54,145
LIAM: Delilah gets knocked out, she gets the fuck
back up again!

1058
01:10:54,145 --> 01:10:56,285
TALIESIN: Four set of corsets.

1059
01:10:56,285 --> 01:11:03,676
MATT: He's a barbarian, I think it is. We have to
work out the 5e classes for the Hamilton

1060
01:11:03,676 --> 01:11:05,806
characters. Get on it, Critters.

1061
01:11:05,806 --> 01:11:08,801
TALIESIN: I'll let everyone know where I am, too.
I'm in the library reading if anybody needs me.

1062
01:11:08,801 --> 01:11:11,635
MATT: Anyone else wishing to accomplish anything
else?

1063
01:11:11,635 --> 01:11:19,589
TRAVIS: I'm in the kitchen. I want to see if they
can make a salad with meat in it.

1064
01:11:19,589 --> 01:11:23,608
TALIESIN: If they figure out how, bring some up to
the library.

1065
01:11:23,608 --> 01:11:25,112
TRAVIS: Okay, I'm not very up to--

1066
01:11:25,112 --> 01:11:29,049
TALIESIN: Deposit it up.

1067
01:11:29,049 --> 01:11:35,387
MATT: Grand Poobah, if this is indeed your
request, they will do their very best to do so.

1068
01:11:35,387 --> 01:11:42,010
Within an hour or so, you are presented with a
bowl of various textures of shredded, cured, and

1069
01:11:42,010 --> 01:11:45,260
prepared meats to loosely resemble a salad, I
guess.

1070
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:46,320
TALIESIN: A malad!

1071
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:47,877
MATT: It's like a giant poke bowl.

1072
01:11:47,877 --> 01:11:50,797
SAM: It's not a salad with meat on it, it's a
salad made of meat?

1073
01:11:50,797 --> 01:11:52,423
LIAM: Thin slices.

1074
01:11:52,423 --> 01:11:55,584
TRAVIS: This is far greater than anything I could
have hoped for.

1075
01:11:55,584 --> 01:11:57,509
TALIESIN: Previously, on Hannibal.

1076
01:11:57,509 --> 01:12:00,646
TRAVIS: Did you invent this just now?

1077
01:12:00,646 --> 01:12:07,330
MATT: You look at the wait staff and they,
"Actually, sir, it was Chef Varon." You look over

1078
01:12:07,330 --> 01:12:11,299
and you see this one, and you've seen a couple of
the chefs here, you haven't interfaced with them

1079
01:12:11,299 --> 01:12:15,073
too much. You're not a social figure necessarily,
more of a demanding figure when it comes to the

1080
01:12:15,073 --> 01:12:23,956
food and the meal. But you see this gentleman with
this thin John Waters pencil mustache, this

1081
01:12:23,956 --> 01:12:31,848
thinning hair that's short, but slick, with a bit
of pattern baldness going on. He's a bit thick

1082
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:35,008
around the waist and he's sitting there with a
big, beaming grin of pride.

1083
01:12:35,008 --> 01:12:43,337
TRAVIS: Chef, this is going to put you on the map.
We need to name it.

1084
01:12:43,337 --> 01:12:51,586
MATT: "Oh, well, Grand Poobah, I image that would
be your honor to give. I am but humbled to present

1085
01:12:51,586 --> 01:12:54,691
"you with such a meal, so the choice is yours."

1086
01:12:54,691 --> 01:12:59,824
TRAVIS: What fine tender meats are in this dish?

1087
01:12:59,824 --> 01:13:06,400
MATT: "Oh, well, we've got quite a variety. I
wanted to provide an extravagant walk through the

1088
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:13,201
"various creatures that we prepare here in
Whitestone. Would you like me to continue?"

1089
01:13:13,201 --> 01:13:15,858
TRAVIS: Please, yes! I'm talking to myself.

1090
01:13:15,858 --> 01:13:24,163
MATT: "We have two-week salted goat meat. On top
of that we have hickory-kept long angle-smoked

1091
01:13:24,163 --> 01:13:35,269
"fish guts mixed in there with a wondrous mix of
minced steaks, we've spared no possible expense on

1092
01:13:35,269 --> 01:13:42,080
"the various pieces of the cow. We've, from that
point forward, presented a sprinkling of pork

1093
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:48,603
"belly that's been ground up and salt-cured as well
over the period of about two months usually kept

1094
01:13:48,603 --> 01:13:51,447
"to our various steam meals, but I thought this was
a special occasion."

1095
01:13:51,447 --> 01:13:55,020
TRAVIS: I'm just free-dripping saliva in and on
the plate.

1096
01:13:55,020 --> 01:14:03,293
MATT: "So, it has a very sedimentary layers of the
planet-type feel to it where each reveal occurs

1097
01:14:03,293 --> 01:14:07,613
"it's a whole different genus of animal. You're
eating nature in a bowl!"

1098
01:14:07,613 --> 01:14:12,821
TRAVIS: I mean, did you even, like, salt it or
nothing? It's just all these beautiful animals in

1099
01:14:12,821 --> 01:14:14,755
my own private ark of a bowl?

1100
01:14:14,755 --> 01:14:16,971
MATT: "They <i>came</i> salted."

1101
01:14:16,971 --> 01:14:23,148
TRAVIS: Well, because it's got goat, fish, beef,
and pork in it I'm going to call it the GoFiBePo.

1102
01:14:23,148 --> 01:14:27,148
MATT: "GoFiBePo it is."

1103
01:14:27,148 --> 01:14:33,422
TRAVIS: But, like, you seem to have an accent, so
let's put a little flair on it when you say it.

1104
01:14:33,422 --> 01:14:37,877
The bowl of GoFiBePo.

1105
01:14:37,877 --> 01:14:40,089
MATT: "GoFiBePo."

1106
01:14:40,089 --> 01:14:41,420
TRAVIS: I like it.

1107
01:14:41,420 --> 01:14:43,697
MATT: "Of course, Grand Poobah."

1108
01:14:43,697 --> 01:14:49,428
TRAVIS: And I must decree there will be no
utensils used when you dine of this sublime dish.

1109
01:14:49,428 --> 01:14:56,008
MATT: He begins writing these things down. "All
right, all right. You would need approval from

1110
01:14:56,008 --> 01:15:01,186
"Lady Cassandra, of course, to put this in the
familial--"

1111
01:15:01,186 --> 01:15:02,275
TRAVIS: Approval?

1112
01:15:02,275 --> 01:15:07,155
MATT: "Well, if you were to make this the official
meal of Whitestone, that is entirely within--"

1113
01:15:07,155 --> 01:15:17,362
TRAVIS: This just gets better and better. Submit
whatever paperwork is necessary.

1114
01:15:17,362 --> 01:15:19,024
See that it's done.

1115
01:15:19,024 --> 01:15:22,423
(laughter)

1116
01:15:22,423 --> 01:15:25,485
MATT: "You heard him, folks! Grand Poobah has
spoken."

1117
01:15:25,485 --> 01:15:27,268
TRAVIS: GoFiBePo.

1118
01:15:27,268 --> 01:15:30,006
MATT: GoFiBePo.

1119
01:15:30,006 --> 01:15:35,284
TRAVIS: Even better. And I'll just start
hand-smashing into my face this

1120
01:15:35,284 --> 01:15:38,829
delicious salted meat collection.

1121
01:15:38,829 --> 01:15:40,886
LAURA: I'm hungry now.

1122
01:15:40,886 --> 01:15:43,575
MATT: Yeah. Oh, it is delightful. It is
delicious.

1123
01:15:43,575 --> 01:15:47,877
TRAVIS: You should not be able to make up food
that delicious just on the fly like that. I

1124
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:52,595
literally felt like I was at a fucking restaurant.
That was absurd.

1125
01:15:52,595 --> 01:15:53,891
LAURA: I want to eat it!

1126
01:15:53,891 --> 01:15:56,523
TALIESIN: As I was saying 'Grand Poobah', I knew
it was going to bite me in the ass.

1127
01:15:56,523 --> 01:15:58,037
I don't know how.

1128
01:15:58,037 --> 01:15:59,903
TRAVIS: Meat salad. You're welcome.

1129
01:15:59,903 --> 01:16:04,250
TALIESIN: It actually sounds really good. Cured
goat meat.

1130
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:06,581
MATT: And it's currently being submitted to the
senate of Whitestone for approval

1131
01:16:06,581 --> 01:16:08,532
to become the official dish.

1132
01:16:08,532 --> 01:16:12,615
TRAVIS: Yeah! After every battle, we'll get all
the protein we need and we'll just fart our happy

1133
01:16:12,615 --> 01:16:14,223
asses off, all night long.

1134
01:16:14,223 --> 01:16:16,110
LIAM: It's all shabu-shabu from here on out.

1135
01:16:16,110 --> 01:16:22,041
MATT: Yeah. With a constitution check it might
improve your speed. All right. So. What else do

1136
01:16:22,041 --> 01:16:25,801
you wish to do, as it is now getting close to the
midnight hour here at Whitestone?

1137
01:16:25,801 --> 01:16:28,913
ASHLEY: I've been an extra set of eyes in the
library.

1138
01:16:28,913 --> 01:16:31,696
MARISHA: Yeah, and I call Vex there as well.

1139
01:16:31,696 --> 01:16:39,728
LAURA: Be there in just a moment, dear. I just
want to find Vax. Can I find Vax?

1140
01:16:39,728 --> 01:16:41,980
LIAM: You can certainly try.

1141
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:50,574
LAURA: I'm going to go look-- I'll look in his
room and then I'll look in the temple to the Raven

1142
01:16:50,574 --> 01:16:51,957
Queen that we have.

1143
01:16:51,957 --> 01:16:53,255
LIAM: I'm in my room.

1144
01:16:53,255 --> 01:16:54,499
LAURA: Hey!

1145
01:16:54,499 --> 01:16:56,621
LIAM: Kiki, is that-- Oh.

1146
01:16:56,621 --> 01:17:01,159
LAURA: Oh. Well. No. Hi. That's gross.

1147
01:17:01,159 --> 01:17:02,830
LIAM: Is it, though? Is it?

1148
01:17:02,830 --> 01:17:10,621
LAURA: Is it? Hey. One quick thing that I was
thinking about, and I know that you keep bringing

1149
01:17:10,621 --> 01:17:12,519
it up and I keep dodging this, right?

1150
01:17:12,519 --> 01:17:13,532
LIAM: Right.

1151
01:17:13,532 --> 01:17:17,109
LAURA: But-- So, when I was researching the Raven
Queen--

1152
01:17:17,109 --> 01:17:18,162
LIAM: Yes.

1153
01:17:18,162 --> 01:17:21,062
LAURA: -- she hates undead.

1154
01:17:21,062 --> 01:17:23,313
LIAM: That's kind of her thing, yeah.

1155
01:17:23,313 --> 01:17:31,588
LAURA: So the fact that Delilah Briarwood is back
again and the person that we're going after, it

1156
01:17:31,588 --> 01:17:32,964
seems perfect.

1157
01:17:32,964 --> 01:17:36,772
LIAM: Almost like fate, isn't it?

1158
01:17:36,772 --> 01:17:37,771
LAURA: Hey.

1159
01:17:37,771 --> 01:17:38,687
LIAM: Hey.

1160
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:44,394
LAURA: Do you think your queen lady is going to
chime in there and help us out? Maybe end this

1161
01:17:44,394 --> 01:17:48,063
cycle of whatever the fuck it is she's doing.

1162
01:17:48,063 --> 01:17:49,631
LIAM: She will be there.

1163
01:17:49,631 --> 01:17:51,489
LAURA: In the Shadowfell?

1164
01:17:51,489 --> 01:17:56,745
LIAM: She will be with us when we reach the end.

1165
01:17:56,745 --> 01:17:59,824
LAURA: That's so cryptic.

1166
01:17:59,824 --> 01:18:01,913
LIAM: Well, it is religion.

1167
01:18:01,913 --> 01:18:03,106
LAURA: Right.

1168
01:18:03,106 --> 01:18:04,115
LIAM: Right.

1169
01:18:04,115 --> 01:18:05,221
LAURA: Okay.

1170
01:18:05,221 --> 01:18:12,072
LIAM: I mean, like Pike has always said, I don't
have all the answers at all.

1171
01:18:12,072 --> 01:18:17,598
LAURA: No. I mean, do you talk to her, though?
Because, you know, Pike talks to Sarenrae.

1172
01:18:17,598 --> 01:18:18,832
LIAM: I do.

1173
01:18:18,832 --> 01:18:23,504
LAURA: Right! So have you asked her if she's going
to help us kill Delilah Briarwood?

1174
01:18:23,504 --> 01:18:29,816
LIAM: You know, she's not very big on specifics.
It's more of a vibe kind of thing.

1175
01:18:29,816 --> 01:18:31,213
LAURA: Okay.

1176
01:18:31,213 --> 01:18:41,207
LIAM: But the vibe I get, I'm not going to call it
good. This is it. This is what you and I have been

1177
01:18:41,207 --> 01:18:42,829
doing our homework for.

1178
01:18:42,829 --> 01:18:44,895
LAURA: All right.

1179
01:18:44,895 --> 01:18:48,020
LIAM: And it's not going to slow down, it's only
going to speed up.

1180
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:50,482
LAURA: Well.

1181
01:18:50,482 --> 01:18:56,861
LIAM: I don't think I'm going back to Zephra
anytime soon.

1182
01:18:56,861 --> 01:19:06,165
LAURA: Not necessarily. Don't talk like that. I'm
serious. You have to keep a positive outlook.

1183
01:19:06,165 --> 01:19:07,817
Otherwise you're doomed.

1184
01:19:07,817 --> 01:19:10,852
LIAM: This is the best year of my life. I'm very
happy.

1185
01:19:10,852 --> 01:19:12,105
LAURA: That's good.

1186
01:19:12,105 --> 01:19:13,118
LIAM: Life is good.

1187
01:19:13,118 --> 01:19:14,387
LAURA: Life is good.

1188
01:19:14,387 --> 01:19:16,511
LIAM: We're going to ensure that it stays that
way.

1189
01:19:16,511 --> 01:19:21,495
LAURA: Yeah. All right.

1190
01:19:21,495 --> 01:19:25,048
LIAM: Sorry I didn't have more for you.

1191
01:19:25,048 --> 01:19:27,779
LAURA: No no no! It's about what I expected.

1192
01:19:27,779 --> 01:19:33,439
LIAM: Hmm. If you see my druid, would you send her
to bed?

1193
01:19:33,439 --> 01:19:35,138
LAURA: Yes.

1194
01:19:35,138 --> 01:19:36,541
LIAM: Thank you.

1195
01:19:36,541 --> 01:19:38,586
LAURA: Good night.

1196
01:19:38,586 --> 01:19:39,874
LIAM: Good night.

1197
01:19:39,874 --> 01:19:41,742
LAURA: And I go to the library.

1198
01:19:41,742 --> 01:19:42,815
MATT: Okay.

1199
01:19:42,815 --> 01:19:44,165
TRAVIS: Boring.

1200
01:19:44,165 --> 01:19:48,915
MATT: Now, Percival, Keyleth. Pike, I believe
you're helping out in the library as well?

1201
01:19:48,915 --> 01:19:51,237
TALIESIN: We're literally reading through old
notes right now.

1202
01:19:51,237 --> 01:19:52,816
MARISHA: A fuckton of old notes.

1203
01:19:52,816 --> 01:19:57,928
MATT: Well, Vex arrives to meet up with you guys
in the library of Whitestone. Whatever you're

1204
01:19:57,928 --> 01:19:59,295
doing, Scanlan, I don't know.

1205
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:00,132
MARISHA: Vex.

1206
01:20:00,132 --> 01:20:01,068
LAURA: What?

1207
01:20:01,068 --> 01:20:06,270
MARISHA: Okay. Oh my gosh. Oh. Okay. Oh, praise
Sarenrae, there's so much going on. Okay. Remember

1208
01:20:06,270 --> 01:20:12,077
how Whitestone used to be all dead and awful? Very
similar to how the other Ziggurat was dead?

1209
01:20:12,077 --> 01:20:13,239
TALIESIN: Yes, of course.

1210
01:20:13,239 --> 01:20:17,762
MARISHA: And then they called the ziggurat the
seat of Pelor, right? So what if it was already

1211
01:20:17,762 --> 01:20:23,826
there? What if she's taking doorways and
dimensions and corrupting them

1212
01:20:23,826 --> 01:20:26,523
and bastardizing them and--

1213
01:20:26,523 --> 01:20:35,090
LAURA: If she's done that, if she did that to the
Sun Tree, how old is Delilah Briarwood?

1214
01:20:35,090 --> 01:20:38,746
TALIESIN: Well, we don't--

1215
01:20:38,746 --> 01:20:41,165
MATT: The Sun Tree has been around since before--

1216
01:20:41,165 --> 01:20:47,583
TALIESIN: The Sun Tree was here before the castle
was here, but-- And things have always happened

1217
01:20:47,583 --> 01:20:54,652
here. The city has a history of strange
occurrences. I'm inclined to believe there was

1218
01:20:54,652 --> 01:20:59,041
something-- Well, there was obviously something
beneath the castle before she got here, or else

1219
01:20:59,041 --> 01:21:00,699
she wouldn't have come here to begin with.

1220
01:21:00,699 --> 01:21:02,514
LAURA: It was a temple to Ioun.

1221
01:21:02,514 --> 01:21:09,782
MATT: The history, you know, is back in the Age of
Arcanum, this valley housed a temple to Ioun,

1222
01:21:09,782 --> 01:21:15,790
which was corrupted, and in the Calamity, the
battle between the gods and mortals that changed

1223
01:21:15,790 --> 01:21:22,628
the epoch, the Knowing Mistress suffered a
grievous wound from Tharizdun, the Chained

1224
01:21:22,628 --> 01:21:30,218
Oblivion. And in that battle, Pelor, the Dawn
Father, delivered enough of a blow to the Chained

1225
01:21:30,218 --> 01:21:37,528
Oblivion to defeat it and aid in locking it away.
With the temple still lost beneath this valley,

1226
01:21:37,528 --> 01:21:43,307
that was when the Sun Tree seed was planted by
Pelor to be guardian over this space.

1227
01:21:43,307 --> 01:21:44,846
MARISHA: What was he locking away?

1228
01:21:44,846 --> 01:21:47,614
MATT: A god called the Chained Oblivion.

1229
01:21:47,614 --> 01:21:50,715
MARISHA: The Chain Oblivion?

1230
01:21:50,715 --> 01:21:55,689
MATT: The Chained Oblivion. Tharizdun. Yeah. A mad
god of chaos and destruction.

1231
01:21:55,689 --> 01:21:57,398
LIAM: Totally awesome metal band.

1232
01:21:57,398 --> 01:21:59,077
TRAVIS: Yeah, great name.

1233
01:21:59,077 --> 01:22:02,145
MARISHA: Okay, well, that's a big deal.

1234
01:22:02,145 --> 01:22:10,319
TALIESIN: And, I mean, I think it's safe to assume
that that's what's down there and that's what they

1235
01:22:10,319 --> 01:22:12,582
were looking for when they came here in the first
place.

1236
01:22:12,582 --> 01:22:13,769
LAURA: Right.

1237
01:22:13,769 --> 01:22:19,551
MARISHA: And Delilah came from Wildmount?

1238
01:22:19,551 --> 01:22:23,707
TALIESIN: Yes. She was also, I mean--

1239
01:22:23,707 --> 01:22:28,191
MARISHA: You did a bunch of research on Vecna. He
used to be a man, right?

1240
01:22:28,191 --> 01:22:30,632
TALIESIN AND LAURA: Yes.

1241
01:22:30,632 --> 01:22:34,693
LAURA: He wanted to become the Prince of the
Undead, right? Am I saying that right? No no no.

1242
01:22:34,693 --> 01:22:42,195
MATT: From what you've come to understand and the
research you've done since the name has come up--

1243
01:22:42,195 --> 01:22:44,434
TALIESIN: I'm pulling out my notes.

1244
01:22:44,434 --> 01:22:46,379
LIAM: We spent a year reading books.

1245
01:22:46,379 --> 01:22:49,435
MATT: Right. Now mind you, the information is
still very hard to find.

1246
01:22:49,435 --> 01:22:51,100
LAURA: Because he's the god of secrets?

1247
01:22:51,100 --> 01:23:03,133
MATT: He's not a god. Wants to be, or at least
wants to, and there is some obsession with the

1248
01:23:03,133 --> 01:23:12,923
ascension of a mortal to a beyond-mortal state.
Which has only been achieved by one being before.

1249
01:23:12,923 --> 01:23:16,865
MARISHA: I mean, it sounds a lot like what Delilah
is going for.

1250
01:23:16,865 --> 01:23:19,639
LAURA: What if she <i>is</i> Vecna?

1251
01:23:19,639 --> 01:23:21,946
MARISHA: What if she <i>is</i> Vecna?

1252
01:23:21,946 --> 01:23:24,948
TALIESIN: Well, or she wants to become the next
Vecna.

1253
01:23:24,948 --> 01:23:39,528
MARISHA: Yeah. Dread Pirate Roberts of the Vecna.
She came from Wildmount, where Vecna originated.

1254
01:23:39,528 --> 01:23:41,584
She came here for research.

1255
01:23:41,584 --> 01:23:44,368
LAURA: She's just finishing what he started.

1256
01:23:44,368 --> 01:23:49,054
MARISHA: Maybe she's just finishing what he
started. And wasn't she doing a bunch of research

1257
01:23:49,054 --> 01:23:54,360
for runes and tomes? Do we have the research that
the Briarwoods--

1258
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:56,397
Didn't we seize a bunch of their research?

1259
01:23:56,397 --> 01:23:59,392
TALIESIN: We got some of it, but they burned a
lot.

1260
01:23:59,392 --> 01:24:04,875
MATT: You got some of it and a lot of it dealt
with ley energies. There are certain lines that

1261
01:24:04,875 --> 01:24:09,938
stretch across, invisible lines that stretch
across Exandria, where the magical powers that

1262
01:24:09,938 --> 01:24:13,790
hold together the planes and protect it through
the Divine Gate and other elements--

1263
01:24:13,790 --> 01:24:18,272
MARISHA: Do any of those ley lines go through
where we were in Marquet?

1264
01:24:18,272 --> 01:24:24,617
MATT: You don't know that. But you do know that
Whitestone resides right beneath a nexus. These

1265
01:24:24,617 --> 01:24:31,926
ley lines were shifted during the Calamity. And
now one of these nexuses is right over Whitestone,

1266
01:24:31,926 --> 01:24:37,395
which is why this location was chosen for the
ritual that the Briarwoods were assembling.

1267
01:24:37,395 --> 01:24:40,623
MARISHA: I wonder if each ziggurat is over a
nexus.

1268
01:24:40,623 --> 01:24:46,956
TALIESIN: It could be. We know that she's not 
ancient, because we have a bit of a paper

1269
01:24:46,956 --> 01:24:55,065
trail. We do know that she was ruling in Wildmount
for a while. We do know that she studied at the

1270
01:24:55,065 --> 01:24:59,827
Alabaster Lyceum briefly. And there's some
paperwork for that.

1271
01:24:59,827 --> 01:25:09,419
MATT: In looking up the background history, you
would know that King Bertrand Dwendal of the

1272
01:25:09,419 --> 01:25:19,679
Dwendalian Empire was given information in regards
to the Briarwoods, who were essentially accused of

1273
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:27,211
forbidden necromancy. And were to be arrested and
put on trial, and that's when they fled westward

1274
01:25:27,211 --> 01:25:31,879
towards Tal'Dorei and then encountered your
family.

1275
01:25:31,879 --> 01:25:32,958
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1276
01:25:32,958 --> 01:25:34,409
LAURA: So they got run out of Wildmount?

1277
01:25:34,409 --> 01:25:35,380
MATT: Seemingly.

1278
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:40,776
TALIESIN: From what we understand and again,
there's not much that survived that. They tend to

1279
01:25:40,776 --> 01:25:42,171
cover their tracks.

1280
01:25:42,171 --> 01:25:45,772
MARISHA: They were also trying to build that whole
bridge situation? Remember the bridge?

1281
01:25:45,772 --> 01:25:46,916
That was weird.

1282
01:25:46,916 --> 01:25:48,452
TALIESIN: They wanted to move. Well--

1283
01:25:48,452 --> 01:25:51,127
MARISHA: They wanted to move an army. Right?

1284
01:25:51,127 --> 01:25:56,413
MATT: The bridge, from what you can tell, there
was no way, plans or means of even building a

1285
01:25:56,413 --> 01:25:59,951
bridge. And a bridge has been attempted in the
past over the Shearing Channel and it's just too--

1286
01:25:59,951 --> 01:26:07,389
The cliffs are too steep and too windy and the
water beneath is too strong. Which is why the

1287
01:26:07,389 --> 01:26:14,280
prospect to the previous sovereign was such a
possible good thing to make a deal with the

1288
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:18,049
Briarwoods at the time. But there are no plans.
Nothing in their notes spoke of actually making a

1289
01:26:18,049 --> 01:26:22,352
bridge. It was more a means to get into the graces
of the royal family.

1290
01:26:22,352 --> 01:26:24,592
TALIESIN: And probably collect assets as well.

1291
01:26:24,592 --> 01:26:26,882
MARISHA: Okay. If you were run out of somewhere--

1292
01:26:26,882 --> 01:26:29,119
TALIESIN: Which I have been.

1293
01:26:29,119 --> 01:26:32,126
MARISHA: Which you have been. After a lot of
research--

1294
01:26:32,126 --> 01:26:33,281
TALIESIN: Which I've done.

1295
01:26:33,281 --> 01:26:35,175
MARISHA: -- and you were trying to do something--

1296
01:26:35,175 --> 01:26:36,581
TALIESIN: Which I do.

1297
01:26:36,581 --> 01:26:44,516
MARISHA: -- what would be your second place of
choosing to go?

1298
01:26:44,516 --> 01:26:47,513
TALIESIN: Anywhere that they serve some sort of
meat salad, I imagine.

1299
01:26:47,513 --> 01:26:51,000
(laughter)

1300
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,968
MARISHA: I'm just saying, if you're run out of one
place for doing something, I imagine--

1301
01:26:53,968 --> 01:26:56,108
TALIESIN: You're thinking maybe they have another
portal in Wildmount.

1302
01:26:56,108 --> 01:26:57,319
MARISHA: Yes, I do.

1303
01:26:57,319 --> 01:26:58,657
TALIESIN: Yes.

1304
01:26:58,657 --> 01:27:00,199
LAURA: Another ziggurat?

1305
01:27:00,199 --> 01:27:01,978
TALIESIN: Could be several of them.

1306
01:27:01,978 --> 01:27:06,617
MARISHA: If they are run out of one place for
something, my first thing would be try to find the

1307
01:27:06,617 --> 01:27:08,245
next place to keep it going.

1308
01:27:08,245 --> 01:27:10,842
LAURA: Right. And then she got run out of here, so
she went to Ank'harel.

1309
01:27:10,842 --> 01:27:17,366
MARISHA: Correct. What if she's already been
killed in Wildmount? So many theories, you guys.

1310
01:27:17,366 --> 01:27:19,897
So many theories! It's kind of exciting.

1311
01:27:19,897 --> 01:27:21,528
TALIESIN: Let's not get overly speculative here.

1312
01:27:21,528 --> 01:27:23,246
TRAVIS: Are ziggurats always pyramids?

1313
01:27:23,246 --> 01:27:28,233
LIAM: That's what a ziggurat is. It's like an
Aztec bip-bip-bip.

1314
01:27:28,233 --> 01:27:33,018
MARISHA: We know the Briarwoods also did dealings
with the Stormwinds in Wildmount.

1315
01:27:33,018 --> 01:27:35,186
LAURA: What other pyramids have we seen, though?
Have we seen any other--

1316
01:27:35,186 --> 01:27:39,434
TRAVIS: The thing we fought the beholder in.

1317
01:27:39,434 --> 01:27:42,212
LAURA: The mindflayer place. That was a ziggurat.

1318
01:27:42,212 --> 01:27:47,397
MARISHA: Son of a bitch!

1319
01:27:47,397 --> 01:27:50,431
LAURA: Under Kraghammer! Oh my god! Is there a
ziggurat in Kraghammer?

1320
01:27:50,431 --> 01:27:52,754
LIAM: Hell yeah there is a ziggurat. Yeah, it was
a ziggurat.

1321
01:27:52,754 --> 01:27:55,510
MATT: You've seen a few, actually.

1322
01:27:55,510 --> 01:27:59,062
LIAM: I'm speaking in my voice because I'm not
there, but he said-- Yeah, oh, he's poker-facing

1323
01:27:59,062 --> 01:28:02,214
it. We said ziggurat many times when we were down
there.

1324
01:28:02,214 --> 01:28:06,865
MARISHA: Did we see a pyramid when we were in
Wildmount? When we went there?

1325
01:28:06,865 --> 01:28:08,659
TALIESIN: We were barely there, though.

1326
01:28:08,659 --> 01:28:14,704
LAURA: But it would've been underground. I mean,
who knows where the fuck it was? Wait, wait, wait!

1327
01:28:14,704 --> 01:28:19,488
What about the temple where we saw the other
sphinx? Was that another ziggurat there?

1328
01:28:19,488 --> 01:28:24,577
MARISHA: And that was up in Vasselheim! Thank you.

1329
01:28:24,577 --> 01:28:26,408
LAURA: Ah! Is there a ziggurat--

1330
01:28:26,408 --> 01:28:30,514
MARISHA: There's a ziggurat on every continent!
(singing) Every continent has a ziggurat.

1331
01:28:30,514 --> 01:28:32,616
LAURA: They can come out everywhere.

1332
01:28:32,616 --> 01:28:35,463
TRAVIS: So collapsing the tunnels didn't really do
that much.

1333
01:28:35,463 --> 01:28:41,024
TALIESIN: No, because it shut one potential vein
of a dozen.

1334
01:28:41,024 --> 01:28:45,044
MARISHA: It's these damn ley lines. I knew there's
been something up with these ley lines and I tried

1335
01:28:45,044 --> 01:28:47,137
to talk to the Sun Tree about it and he didn't
know.

1336
01:28:47,137 --> 01:28:48,190
LAURA: Well, he's a tree.

1337
01:28:48,190 --> 01:28:49,402
MARISHA: He's a tree.

1338
01:28:49,402 --> 01:28:51,205
TALIESIN: Be nice to the Sun Tree.

1339
01:28:51,205 --> 01:28:52,439
MARISHA: No, he's very cool.

1340
01:28:52,439 --> 01:28:55,998
TRAVIS: So all the bodies that were hanging under
Whitestone, right, they were all stapled to the

1341
01:28:55,998 --> 01:29:00,057
walls? Was that the army? Was she trying to fill
them with necromantic energy?

1342
01:29:00,057 --> 01:29:02,828
TALIESIN: Oh my god, they would've come alive if
there had been a giant blast of necrotic energy.

1343
01:29:02,828 --> 01:29:05,313
TRAVIS: Yeah. The bodies weren't feeding the
thing. She was trying to imbue them with--

1344
01:29:05,313 --> 01:29:07,033
TALIESIN: She was preparing to create an army.

1345
01:29:07,033 --> 01:29:08,445
LIAM: Yeah. And they were missing arms?

1346
01:29:08,445 --> 01:29:12,220
LAURA: We didn't look in the ziggurat in
Ank'harel. There could've been bodies there, too.

1347
01:29:12,220 --> 01:29:13,828
TALIESIN: I don't think they had gotten that far
yet.

1348
01:29:13,828 --> 01:29:16,590
MARISHA: And one of the things I have written
down.

1349
01:29:16,590 --> 01:29:20,493
TRAVIS: Why were they throwing magical things into
it, though? It was magical items into--

1350
01:29:20,493 --> 01:29:23,731
TALIESIN: Offerings? Because they would've become
magical once they got to the other side of the

1351
01:29:23,731 --> 01:29:25,628
portal. I mean, they would've been great gifts.

1352
01:29:25,628 --> 01:29:28,062
LIAM: What do you think, Taryon Darrington? Or
Scanlan.

1353
01:29:28,062 --> 01:29:31,082
MATT: Tary is fixing Doty.

1354
01:29:31,082 --> 01:29:33,789
SAM: I'm just giving him CPR.

1355
01:29:33,789 --> 01:29:35,587
(laughter)

1356
01:29:35,587 --> 01:29:37,405
SAM: You've never given up on anything in your
life. Now live!

1357
01:29:37,405 --> 01:29:39,669
(laughter)

1358
01:29:39,669 --> 01:29:45,399
LIAM: Ed Harris in The Abyss. You've never given
up a day in your life, you bitch.

1359
01:29:45,399 --> 01:29:48,109
ASHLEY: Scanlan?

1360
01:29:48,109 --> 01:29:50,631
SAM: I'm in my room, praying.

1361
01:29:50,631 --> 01:29:51,966
LAURA: You're not here?

1362
01:29:51,966 --> 01:29:53,585
MARISHA: In your room, praying?

1363
01:29:53,585 --> 01:29:54,889
LAURA: Praying to Sarenrae?

1364
01:29:54,889 --> 01:29:56,706
SAM: Mm-hm. Or Logic.

1365
01:29:56,706 --> 01:29:59,954
(laughter)

1366
01:29:59,954 --> 01:30:02,029
TALIESIN: Logic is a fickle god.

1367
01:30:02,029 --> 01:30:08,087
MARISHA: Yeah. Desmond (mumbles). Briarwood's
carriage driver.

1368
01:30:08,087 --> 01:30:10,583
Lady Briarwood is immune to daylight.

1369
01:30:10,583 --> 01:30:12,716
TALIESIN: It's like watching your game in
fast-forward.

1370
01:30:12,716 --> 01:30:18,001
MARISHA: Briarwoods have an army. I have it in
giant, big letters,

1371
01:30:18,001 --> 01:30:19,677
but I don't know what that means.

1372
01:30:19,677 --> 01:30:24,949
LAURA: Obviously, it would take a very long time
to go to every ziggurat that we've seen and see if

1373
01:30:24,949 --> 01:30:29,835
there's an army inside of it. If they've been
preparing things there over this past year that we

1374
01:30:29,835 --> 01:30:31,350
haven't been doing anything!

1375
01:30:31,350 --> 01:30:34,706
TRAVIS: We don't know that any of this is right.
We should just go through.

1376
01:30:34,706 --> 01:30:37,628
LAURA: We should go to the Shadowfell and fucking
end this before

1377
01:30:37,628 --> 01:30:39,559
she sets out her armies everywhere.

1378
01:30:39,559 --> 01:30:43,814
TRAVIS: We did let her regroup a little bit, but
we didn't know what we were doing.

1379
01:30:43,814 --> 01:30:46,022
TALIESIN: There was nothing we could have done.

1380
01:30:46,022 --> 01:30:53,125
TRAVIS: Do you want to mess with the stones? Try
and duplicate them? We have seven, right?

1381
01:30:53,125 --> 01:30:55,210
LAURA: We have seven. We could go through.

1382
01:30:55,210 --> 01:30:56,639
TALIESIN: Seven of us could go through.

1383
01:30:56,639 --> 01:30:58,509
SAM: (whispering) We're only seven people.

1384
01:30:58,509 --> 01:30:59,966
LAURA: There's only seven of us.

1385
01:30:59,966 --> 01:31:02,374
TALIESIN: There's eight. One of us would have to
stay behind.

1386
01:31:02,374 --> 01:31:04,136
SAM: Who's the eighth? Count the table, friend.

1387
01:31:04,136 --> 01:31:05,552
TRAVIS: Tary's staying.

1388
01:31:05,552 --> 01:31:08,454
TALIESIN: Tary's the eighth. Are we going to go
through with Tary?

1389
01:31:08,454 --> 01:31:10,442
I'm being such an asshole right now.

1390
01:31:10,442 --> 01:31:11,909
MATT: You're terrible.

1391
01:31:11,909 --> 01:31:15,477
MARISHA: I could also maybe Plane Shift us there
with one of these?

1392
01:31:15,477 --> 01:31:23,157
TRAVIS: If we take damage going through the portal
with the stone, does that mean we might take

1393
01:31:23,157 --> 01:31:25,147
damage if you Plane Shift us there?

1394
01:31:25,147 --> 01:31:26,974
LAURA: Who knows? It's the Shadowfell.

1395
01:31:26,974 --> 01:31:32,259
TALIESIN: I say we speak with Allura, and if this
looks--

1396
01:31:32,259 --> 01:31:39,625
LAURA: We need to talk to Eskil Ryndarien and see
what he knows about the Shadowfell, right? He's

1397
01:31:39,625 --> 01:31:41,243
been studying the Shadowfell, too.

1398
01:31:41,243 --> 01:31:42,424
MATT: Since he arrived, yeah.

1399
01:31:42,424 --> 01:31:45,139
TALIESIN: I think the plan is we take the fight to
them.

1400
01:31:45,139 --> 01:31:46,594
LAURA and TRAVIS: Yeah.

1401
01:31:46,594 --> 01:31:52,000
MARISHA: Is it worth going back to any of the
other ziggurats, or no?

1402
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,405
LAURA: I don't think so, at this point.

1403
01:31:53,405 --> 01:31:58,351
TALIESIN: I think that it's not time to check the
doors. It's time to go out and chase the monsters.

1404
01:31:58,351 --> 01:32:02,217
If we take care of them, it doesn't matter how
many ziggurats there are.

1405
01:32:02,217 --> 01:32:03,489
TRAVIS: Yes.

1406
01:32:03,489 --> 01:32:05,841
LAURA: We just have to--

1407
01:32:05,841 --> 01:32:08,708
TALIESIN: Hope we don't miss one. Travel the
world.

1408
01:32:08,708 --> 01:32:12,370
LAURA: Hey, at least Vecna's not a god. Bonus
there.

1409
01:32:12,370 --> 01:32:13,818
MARISHA: That's true.

1410
01:32:13,818 --> 01:32:19,291
TALIESIN: Let's have an evening, and then
tomorrow, we'll--

1411
01:32:19,291 --> 01:32:21,292
TRAVIS: Tally-ho?

1412
01:32:21,292 --> 01:32:27,494
TALIESIN: Collect what we've learned, and if we're
prepared, jump into a sphere of death.

1413
01:32:27,494 --> 01:32:29,227
LAURA: We can't waste time.

1414
01:32:29,227 --> 01:32:33,753
MARISHA: If we jump through the sphere of death,
they might be expecting us on the other side of

1415
01:32:33,753 --> 01:32:39,472
the sphere of death. If we Plane Shift, we might
be able to come up with a

1416
01:32:39,472 --> 01:32:42,086
flanky, secret, other tactic.

1417
01:32:42,086 --> 01:32:45,493
TALIESIN: If you can figure out a way to use one
of these to create a Plane Shift that you'll feel

1418
01:32:45,493 --> 01:32:50,398
comfortable with, then I'm all right with that.

1419
01:32:50,398 --> 01:32:53,408
MARISHA: I'll talk it over with other magic-users,
first.

1420
01:32:53,408 --> 01:32:55,038
TRAVIS: Which ones?

1421
01:32:55,038 --> 01:32:58,271
MARISHA: I don't know. I'll find one.

1422
01:32:58,271 --> 01:33:01,321
LIAM: We can go visit one of them. I'm not there.

1423
01:33:01,321 --> 01:33:02,721
MATT: You're not there.

1424
01:33:02,721 --> 01:33:04,546
TRAVIS: Make the call.

1425
01:33:04,546 --> 01:33:06,780
MARISHA: Eskil knows stuff like that.

1426
01:33:06,780 --> 01:33:10,664
TALIESIN: Let's all get some sleep, and in the
morning, we're going to take care of this. One way

1427
01:33:10,664 --> 01:33:12,328
or the other, we'll take this fight to them.

1428
01:33:12,328 --> 01:33:15,103
LAURA: You'll talk to Eskil, because I hate that
motherfucker.

1429
01:33:15,103 --> 01:33:18,819
TALIESIN: He likes you. Well, he doesn't dislike
you any more than he dislikes anybody else.

1430
01:33:18,819 --> 01:33:22,488
MARISHA: He dislikes you even less. He just hates
everyone.

1431
01:33:22,488 --> 01:33:24,771
TALIESIN: He's terrible, isn't he?

1432
01:33:24,771 --> 01:33:26,386
LAURA: Crotchety old fuck.

1433
01:33:26,386 --> 01:33:30,312
MATT: All right, so you're all going to go in for
the evening,

1434
01:33:30,312 --> 01:33:32,179
and we'll come back to this in the morning.

1435
01:33:32,179 --> 01:33:33,665
LIAM: Wait. One second.

1436
01:33:33,665 --> 01:33:35,043
MATT: Sorry, go ahead.

1437
01:33:35,043 --> 01:33:36,503
LIAM: Did you guys--

1438
01:33:36,503 --> 01:33:39,056
MARISHA: Oh my gosh. We figured out so much
stuff.

1439
01:33:39,056 --> 01:33:40,849
LIAM: Give me the download.

1440
01:33:40,849 --> 01:33:45,030
MARISHA: Delilah might be Vecna, and all this,
there are ziggurats everywhere, and we're so dumb

1441
01:33:45,030 --> 01:33:48,995
because we've probably seen several ziggurats, and
they're all on these massive ley lines, and I give

1442
01:33:48,995 --> 01:33:50,069
him a whole dialogue.

1443
01:33:50,069 --> 01:33:51,147
MATT: Okay.

1444
01:33:51,147 --> 01:34:00,202
LIAM: Holy moly. Do you need to get word back
home? Because I don't think we're going home.

1445
01:34:00,202 --> 01:34:02,076
MARISHA: What do you mean?

1446
01:34:02,076 --> 01:34:08,129
LIAM: I mean, the dreams I've been having all year
and telling you about. They felt like this. This

1447
01:34:08,129 --> 01:34:10,500
is the moment.

1448
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:15,359
MARISHA: You think if we go in, we're never coming
back?

1449
01:34:15,359 --> 01:34:17,974
LIAM: I'm not saying that.

1450
01:34:17,974 --> 01:34:25,421
MARISHA: You think if we go in, <i>you're</i> never
coming back?

1451
01:34:25,421 --> 01:34:31,427
LIAM: Well, I didn't say that, either. We were
going to go back in a day or two, and I don't

1452
01:34:31,427 --> 01:34:38,213
think that's happening. Do you think everyone at
home, they're good?

1453
01:34:38,213 --> 01:34:42,599
MARISHA: I'll have someone send a message.

1454
01:34:42,599 --> 01:34:44,522
LIAM: Okay.

1455
01:34:44,522 --> 01:34:52,468
MARISHA: You can't resign to this. You can't give
up on me.

1456
01:34:52,468 --> 01:34:58,619
LIAM: Kiki, I'm not giving up. I will never give
up on you.

1457
01:34:58,619 --> 01:35:02,221
MARISHA: I can see it in your eyes. You think this
is it.

1458
01:35:02,221 --> 01:35:18,867
LIAM: I'm so glad that we're together for this,
whatever it is. And no, I'm not resigned. I would

1459
01:35:18,867 --> 01:35:26,514
love to see you off to a very long life in Zephra.
No, with you. With you, until I'm not with you.

1460
01:35:26,514 --> 01:35:34,476
Your dad's probably worrying. I worry about him
worrying about you, that's all.

1461
01:35:34,476 --> 01:35:40,717
MARISHA: Really? Everything going on right now,
and you're worried about my dad? Typical

1462
01:35:40,717 --> 01:35:42,799
boyfriend, I guess. That's fair.

1463
01:35:42,799 --> 01:35:49,872
LIAM: You know, I am so anxious right now, and the
only thing that is going to distract me is all

1464
01:35:49,872 --> 01:35:57,165
your fucking freckles, so come to bed, all right?
Come on.

1465
01:35:57,165 --> 01:36:02,050
MARISHA: Promise me you'll come back with me, no
matter what.

1466
01:36:02,050 --> 01:36:07,392
LIAM: I promise.

1467
01:36:07,392 --> 01:36:10,847
MARISHA: Even if it doesn't happen, just promise.

1468
01:36:10,847 --> 01:36:15,314
LIAM: Well, that's an easy promise to make. I
promise.

1469
01:36:15,314 --> 01:36:18,134
MARISHA: I just need you to believe it.

1470
01:36:18,134 --> 01:36:24,722
LIAM: I believe. Get the fuck in this bed.

1471
01:36:24,722 --> 01:36:26,118
MARISHA: Sure.

1472
01:36:26,118 --> 01:36:31,665
MATT: Okay, so you all find your evening's rest,
preparing for the next morning in whatever means

1473
01:36:31,665 --> 01:36:37,527
you wish to prepare for. We're going to take a
break. We'll be back here in a few minutes to pick

1474
01:36:37,527 --> 01:36:43,574
up this next length of the journey and see where
it takes us. We're giving away on the break a

1475
01:36:43,574 --> 01:36:47,161
Purpleheart dice box from Wyrmwood.

1476
01:36:47,161 --> 01:36:49,596
LIAM: That's the most beautiful one.

1477
01:36:49,596 --> 01:36:51,343
LAURA and ASHLEY: The Scanlan wood!

1478
01:36:51,343 --> 01:36:55,232
MATT: Get that Scanlan wood!

1479
01:36:55,232 --> 01:36:58,266
LIAM: I mean, the Gabon ebony is really nice, but
the Purpleheart--

1480
01:36:58,266 --> 01:36:59,660
SAM: Did you say gay-bone?

1481
01:36:59,660 --> 01:37:01,096
LIAM: It's the Gabon. Gabon?

1482
01:37:01,096 --> 01:37:08,571
MATT: Yes, so for that contest you need to come
over to Twitch chat, and I've actually forgotten

1483
01:37:08,571 --> 01:37:11,388
what word we chose for today.

1484
01:37:11,388 --> 01:37:12,646
SAM: Scorsese.

1485
01:37:12,702 --> 01:37:21,495
MATT: (laughs) What was the word? Thank you.
Whisper. The word is whisper. So go ahead and when

1486
01:37:21,495 --> 01:37:25,208
prompted, enter "whisper" into the chat room to
enter, and we'll come back after the break to

1487
01:37:25,208 --> 01:37:28,300
announce who the lucky winner is. We'll see you
guys in a few minutes.

1488
01:37:28,300 --> 01:37:29,613
(cheering)

1489
01:37:29,613 --> 01:59:14,174
[break]

1490
01:59:14,174 --> 01:59:21,084
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome back to
Critical Role. Oh god, they're closer now. I'm

1491
01:59:21,084 --> 01:59:23,669
starting to rethink this scenario.

1492
01:59:23,669 --> 01:59:25,597
LIAM: Life comes at you fast, Matt.

1493
01:59:25,597 --> 01:59:28,369
MATT: That it does, apparently. Anyway, welcome
back.

1494
01:59:28,369 --> 01:59:30,018
LAURA: I think that was the best one I've ever
heard, though, Ashley.

1495
01:59:30,018 --> 01:59:31,189
That was a really good one.

1496
01:59:31,189 --> 01:59:33,424
MATT: You may fight one later.

1497
01:59:33,424 --> 01:59:36,642
(laughter)

1498
01:59:36,642 --> 01:59:46,216
MATT: So as you guys rested for the evening and
found yourself the following morning, presenting

1499
01:59:46,216 --> 01:59:52,731
the possibility of making your way into the
Shadowfell and what waits for you there. You come

1500
01:59:52,731 --> 01:59:57,011
to consciousness, you have your morning meal, you
begin to plot and plan. What do you wish to do?

1501
01:59:57,011 --> 02:00:00,999
MARISHA: Go find Eskil.

1502
02:00:00,999 --> 02:00:04,617
LAURA: Go find Eskil. Somebody else is going to go
find out from him, right?

1503
02:00:04,617 --> 02:00:11,040
MATT: He's actually eating out in the garden. He
has one of the little tables set out there. It's a

1504
02:00:11,040 --> 02:00:16,060
nice morning out in Whitestone right now. It's
chilly, but the clouds have broken a bit. You can

1505
02:00:16,060 --> 02:00:19,572
see some blue skies; a little bit of sun's
breaking through. He's out there with Jecht, his

1506
02:00:19,572 --> 02:00:27,404
associate, who's in the process of cutting his
food for him while Eskil's sitting there, still

1507
02:00:27,404 --> 02:00:32,525
looking through books and occasionally reaching
over and plucking things from his plate to eat. As

1508
02:00:32,525 --> 02:00:36,599
you approach him, he doesn't even look up. He
goes, "Yes? What do you require?"

1509
02:00:36,599 --> 02:00:39,231
MARISHA: Good morning.

1510
02:00:39,231 --> 02:00:42,058
MATT: "Good morning to you, as well, I suppose."

1511
02:00:42,058 --> 02:00:45,135
MARISHA: Lovely weather today, isn't it?

1512
02:00:45,135 --> 02:00:47,230
MATT: "It is weather, yes."

1513
02:00:47,230 --> 02:00:52,045
MARISHA: So! How's the research on the Shadowfell
going?

1514
02:00:52,045 --> 02:00:55,990
MATT: "It's done. I've researched it. I don't know
what you require."

1515
02:00:55,990 --> 02:00:59,691
MARISHA: All of it. All of the research?

1516
02:00:59,691 --> 02:01:04,027
MATT: "As much as is in the tomes I have at my
disposal, yes."

1517
02:01:04,089 --> 02:01:13,029
MARISHA: Anything we should know? Anything
important? Fill us in a little bit? Spark Notes?

1518
02:01:13,029 --> 02:01:23,513
MATT: "It's a plane of negative energy, and
elements of it are used to funnel the transition

1519
02:01:23,513 --> 02:01:32,521
"of souls from life to death or back. A number of
it is scourged by undeath and those that skirt

1520
02:01:32,521 --> 02:01:40,011
"that process. It exists as a mirror plane, much
like the Feywild. There are elements that resemble

1521
02:01:40,011 --> 02:01:50,377
"Exandria, but twisted, shifted. It is a very
barren, very broken, dust-filled, dark-- not a

1522
02:01:50,377 --> 02:01:52,037
"very pleasant place, really."

1523
02:01:52,037 --> 02:01:53,638
LIAM: And chock-full of undead, you said?

1524
02:01:53,638 --> 02:01:55,713
MATT: "Elements of it, yes."

1525
02:01:55,713 --> 02:02:01,451
MARISHA: Used to transport souls? Give me a
second.

1526
02:02:01,451 --> 02:02:07,096
LIAM: Sorry, she carries this book around. She's
very precise with her notes.

1527
02:02:07,096 --> 02:02:10,016
MATT: "Good. You should be. Precision is
recommended."

1528
02:02:10,016 --> 02:02:18,842
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to show him the necklace
that we found. This seems to have a slight magical

1529
02:02:18,842 --> 02:02:23,595
attunement to the Shadowfell. Do you think I could
use this as a plane-shifting device?

1530
02:02:23,595 --> 02:02:33,287
MATT: "It would need some alteration. It's
possible. Very careful alteration. You need it to

1531
02:02:33,287 --> 02:02:41,368
"be a very narrow fork in order to properly channel
the spell, and this does not quite match the

1532
02:02:41,368 --> 02:02:47,781
"proper division of magical energies. It could be
physically altered to do so, but too much and you

1533
02:02:47,781 --> 02:02:50,290
"ruin the minor enchantment and attunement."

1534
02:02:50,290 --> 02:02:52,019
MARISHA: All right. That's very good to know.

1535
02:02:52,019 --> 02:02:53,269
LIAM: But doable?

1536
02:02:53,269 --> 02:02:55,308
MARISHA: With how much time?

1537
02:02:55,308 --> 02:03:00,094
MATT: "I don't know. I'm no metalworker. I imagine
not too much."

1538
02:03:00,094 --> 02:03:07,797
MARISHA: Okay. Are you able to send messages? You
have Sending, yeah?

1539
02:03:07,797 --> 02:03:17,681
MATT: He leans back, looking slightly offended. "I
have means to communicate with individuals of

1540
02:03:17,681 --> 02:03:19,393
"importance, yes."

1541
02:03:19,393 --> 02:03:26,726
MARISHA: Just wondering if you could tell my dad
that I might be gone for a long time?

1542
02:03:26,726 --> 02:03:30,526
MATT: "I have absolutely no interest in any of
what you just said."

1543
02:03:30,526 --> 02:03:37,953
MARISHA: I'd really owe you one, Eskil. Just a
quick message?

1544
02:03:37,953 --> 02:03:42,481
MATT: "I'm not a messenger service for
individuals' parental units."

1545
02:03:42,481 --> 02:03:49,339
LIAM: Well, we are potentially going to throw
ourselves at the greatest evil that this world has

1546
02:03:49,339 --> 02:03:54,109
ever known, in the hopes that the entire world can
survive, so that's a big favor. That's a big gimme

1547
02:03:54,109 --> 02:03:59,205
for you. So maybe in exchange for that, you could
send a little message.

1548
02:03:59,205 --> 02:04:03,396
MARISHA: Just to my dad to let him know that I
might die attempting to--

1549
02:04:03,396 --> 02:04:05,566
MATT: "Who's your father?"

1550
02:04:05,566 --> 02:04:12,044
MARISHA: Korren of the Ashari, who is one of the
headmasters.

1551
02:04:12,044 --> 02:04:16,756
MATT: "Right, of the wind people. Whatever. Right,
okay."

1552
02:04:16,756 --> 02:04:20,192
LIAM: Who is your daddy, and what does he do?

1553
02:04:20,192 --> 02:04:22,833
(laughter)

1554
02:04:22,833 --> 02:04:27,207
MATT: He thinks for a second. Begins to run his
finger in the air, and you watch as there's a

1555
02:04:27,207 --> 02:04:37,226
faint scrolling of soft bluish-white light. (poof)
Turns to smoke and vanishes. "All right, he knows

1556
02:04:37,226 --> 02:04:40,356
"you're going to be off doing stuff in the
Shadowfell and probably won't be back for a while."

1557
02:04:40,356 --> 02:04:42,191
MARISHA: Thank you.

1558
02:04:42,191 --> 02:04:43,628
MATT: "You're welcome."

1559
02:04:43,628 --> 02:04:53,354
MARISHA: Can we maybe borrow your research notes
on the Shadowfell? Is that a thing? No? (sighs)

1560
02:04:53,354 --> 02:04:56,593
MATT: (thud)

1561
02:04:56,593 --> 02:04:57,792
MARISHA: Thank you.

1562
02:04:57,792 --> 02:04:59,607
LIAM: Seriously, thank you.

1563
02:04:59,607 --> 02:05:01,060
MARISHA: Thank you.

1564
02:05:01,060 --> 02:05:03,854
MATT: "You're welcome. I will call into this favor
later."

1565
02:05:03,854 --> 02:05:09,249
MARISHA: Sure. You know where to find us. What?

1566
02:05:09,249 --> 02:05:10,304
LIAM: Nothing.

1567
02:05:10,304 --> 02:05:13,268
MARISHA: All right. Enjoy your tea and biscuits.

1568
02:05:13,268 --> 02:05:16,810
MATT: "I will."

1569
02:05:16,810 --> 02:05:18,797
MARISHA: Thanks, Eskil.

1570
02:05:18,797 --> 02:05:20,520
LIAM: Are they sweet or savory?

1571
02:05:20,520 --> 02:05:21,830
MATT: "They're delicious."

1572
02:05:21,830 --> 02:05:22,873
LIAM: I grab one.

1573
02:05:22,873 --> 02:05:24,394
MATT: (frustrated noise)

1574
02:05:24,394 --> 02:05:35,268
LAURA: While that was going on, is that caravan
still in town that was coming through? We've only

1575
02:05:35,268 --> 02:05:36,514
been gone a day.

1576
02:05:36,514 --> 02:05:37,872
MATT: It's still in town.

1577
02:05:37,872 --> 02:05:44,644
LAURA: Are there any fancy fucking chalices that I
could fucking buy for a Heroes' Feast?

1578
02:05:44,644 --> 02:05:46,829
MATT: (laughs)

1579
02:05:46,829 --> 02:05:49,306
LIAM: Whitestone is made of fancy chalices, isn't
it, Percy?

1580
02:05:49,306 --> 02:05:51,468
TALIESIN: We have a chalice room.

1581
02:05:51,468 --> 02:05:57,371
MATT: I will say, if you're spending a good
portion of the morning going around, asking. Being

1582
02:05:57,371 --> 02:06:04,320
your charismatic self and well-versed in gathering
information in a marketplace, you do find two

1583
02:06:04,320 --> 02:06:08,639
chalices for sale that would match the
specifications required to cast a Heroes' Feast.

1584
02:06:08,639 --> 02:06:10,982
TALIESIN: Hey. Do you want to buy a chalice?

1585
02:06:10,982 --> 02:06:12,622
LAURA: Fabulous!

1586
02:06:12,622 --> 02:06:15,838
MATT: "The finest chalices this side of Wildemount.
It's crazy."

1587
02:06:15,838 --> 02:06:18,095
TALIESIN: Sipping cups. What do you need?

1588
02:06:18,095 --> 02:06:19,996
LIAM: One of them is super gauche.

1589
02:06:19,996 --> 02:06:26,820
MATT: "This one has an anti-dribble chinnage. For
all those nights you're drinking too hard and you

1590
02:06:26,820 --> 02:06:29,218
"don't want to spill all over your front pouch?"

1591
02:06:29,218 --> 02:06:31,138
LAURA: Do you have a sippy cup lid, though?

1592
02:06:31,138 --> 02:06:34,307
MATT: "That will cost you extra."

1593
02:06:34,307 --> 02:06:35,925
LAURA: How much?

1594
02:06:35,925 --> 02:06:40,173
MATT: "Five gold, for the sippy cup."

1595
02:06:40,173 --> 02:06:43,835
SAM: Is this fancy enough for a Heroes' Feast?

1596
02:06:43,835 --> 02:06:45,650
LAURA: How much for the cup?

1597
02:06:45,650 --> 02:06:51,592
MATT: "Each cup, because these traveled quite a
bit. They'll bring you about 1,200 gold pieces."

1598
02:06:51,592 --> 02:06:53,723
LAURA: 1,200 gold pieces.

1599
02:06:53,723 --> 02:06:54,887
MARISHA: Apiece, or total?

1600
02:06:54,887 --> 02:06:56,387
MATT: "Apiece."

1601
02:06:56,387 --> 02:07:01,595
LIAM: Why is the school crossing guard from my
hometown in New Jersey in Whitestone right now?

1602
02:07:01,595 --> 02:07:04,466
MATT: "Hey, you think I haven't been busy after
you left school?"

1603
02:07:04,466 --> 02:07:07,676
(laughter)

1604
02:07:07,676 --> 02:07:09,653
LIAM: Everybody in Weehawken is like, what
happened to Larry?

1605
02:07:09,653 --> 02:07:13,073
MATT: "Found a new occupation: chalice
collector."

1606
02:07:13,073 --> 02:07:16,570
TALIESIN: What am I going to do with all these
chalices?

1607
02:07:16,570 --> 02:07:18,560
MATT: "Actually..."

1608
02:07:18,560 --> 02:07:27,617
LAURA: Well, Larry. You know that these chalices
are probably going to be used to save the world.

1609
02:07:27,617 --> 02:07:30,822
MATT: "That sounds like a perfect reason to buy
them."

1610
02:07:30,822 --> 02:07:35,926
LAURA: It does, doesn't it? And just think how
wonderful it will be when you can tell everyone

1611
02:07:35,926 --> 02:07:41,249
that you sell to that you sold the things that
saved the world to Vox Machina.

1612
02:07:41,249 --> 02:07:45,429
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

1613
02:07:45,429 --> 02:07:50,560
LAURA: It wasn't a one. Persuasion, 19.

1614
02:07:50,560 --> 02:07:58,894
MATT: "Vox Machina, you say? You know these
folks?"

1615
02:07:58,894 --> 02:08:01,777
LAURA: Lady Vex'ahlia, at your service.

1616
02:08:01,777 --> 02:08:11,954
MATT: His eye widens on one side. "Well, I've not
really seen or know much about you folks, but I've

1617
02:08:11,954 --> 02:08:15,135
"heard tales of you."

1618
02:08:15,135 --> 02:08:18,794
LAURA: I turn and show him the scales from the
Chroma Conclave.

1619
02:08:18,794 --> 02:08:30,073
MATT: "That real dragon? No shit. Well, I mean,
tell you what." He pulls out a piece of paper and

1620
02:08:30,073 --> 02:08:34,925
starts scrawling on it. He pulls out his inkwell
and starts dipping it. "If you would do the honor

1621
02:08:34,925 --> 02:08:39,859
"of signing this official document that says that
these were sold to none other than Lady Vex'ahlia

1622
02:08:39,859 --> 02:08:45,199
"of Vox Machina that I can use as proof of this
transaction for my own promotional purposes, I'll

1623
02:08:45,199 --> 02:08:47,885
"be happy to give you both of these--"

1624
02:08:47,885 --> 02:08:51,387
LAURA: This is my favorite shop on the Citadel.

1625
02:08:51,387 --> 02:08:54,504
TALIESIN: This is the equivalent of the head shot
on the wall.

1626
02:08:54,504 --> 02:09:00,521
MATT: Yeah, basically. "I will happily give you
both of these at a discount of 1,000 gold pieces apiece."

1627
02:09:00,521 --> 02:09:05,365
LAURA: I like your style. Can I insight and make
sure this isn't some sort of

1628
02:09:05,365 --> 02:09:07,020
enchanted piece of fucking--

1629
02:09:07,020 --> 02:09:09,529
MATT: Sure, go for it.

1630
02:09:09,529 --> 02:09:12,659
LAURA: What would I add to that?

1631
02:09:12,659 --> 02:09:14,187
MATT: Your insight.

1632
02:09:14,187 --> 02:09:17,877
LAURA: Okay, see if he's full of shit. 14?

1633
02:09:17,877 --> 02:09:19,707
MATT: 14? Hard to read.

1634
02:09:19,707 --> 02:09:23,031
(laughter)

1635
02:09:23,031 --> 02:09:25,608
LAURA: You know what? Fuck it. We're probably
going to die, anyway.

1636
02:09:25,608 --> 02:09:37,993
MATT: "A pleasure doing business with you,
milady." Hands you the two chalices. They're

1637
02:09:37,993 --> 02:09:44,060
beautiful. One's more reddish gem-encrusted. The
other has a platinum spiral that runs around the

1638
02:09:44,060 --> 02:09:46,420
base of it. They're both beautiful and intricate.

1639
02:09:46,420 --> 02:09:49,217
LAURA: And you just threw the sippy cup lid as a
little--

1640
02:09:49,217 --> 02:09:50,872
MATT: "Yeah, okay."

1641
02:09:50,872 --> 02:09:54,757
TALIESIN: For the chalice on the go.

1642
02:09:54,757 --> 02:09:59,011
LIAM: Now stay in school, Liam. Stay in school.

1643
02:09:59,011 --> 02:10:06,815
MATT: "Wait, that guy looks familiar." I forgot to
also say we have a winner, by the way. Kiajade.

1644
02:10:06,815 --> 02:10:11,704
Congratulations. I should have mentioned that. I
got caught up in the story. Thank god that's never

1645
02:10:11,704 --> 02:10:17,178
happened before. But congratulations. All right.
You've acquired your chalices. What other business

1646
02:10:17,178 --> 02:10:18,762
do you guys want to take care of?

1647
02:10:18,762 --> 02:10:25,118
TALIESIN: I'm going to make sure I have enough
powder and shot for a bit of a jaunt, so I'm going

1648
02:10:25,118 --> 02:10:31,507
into the stores of what we make here and
reloading. I'm also going to try and make some

1649
02:10:31,507 --> 02:10:33,508
silver shot. I've never tried it before.

1650
02:10:33,508 --> 02:10:35,612
MATT: Okay.

1651
02:10:35,612 --> 02:10:40,329
TALIESIN: Not a ton. I want to try and make 12. I
want to see if I can make 12.

1652
02:10:40,329 --> 02:10:45,247
MATT: Make a tinkering check. Dexterity. Well, no.
This would be intelligence.

1653
02:10:45,247 --> 02:10:46,683
TALIESIN: It's intelligence?

1654
02:10:46,683 --> 02:10:49,283
MATT: It's a new concept you're trying.

1655
02:10:49,283 --> 02:10:54,142
TALIESIN: Intelligence check.

1656
02:10:54,142 --> 02:10:56,391
MATT: Plus your proficiency.

1657
02:10:56,391 --> 02:11:01,516
TALIESIN: Plus my proficiency. That's 19.

1658
02:11:01,516 --> 02:11:11,324
MATT: 19? Sure. You manage to make about 12 pieces
of silver shot. You know, for the most part,

1659
02:11:11,324 --> 02:11:14,959
because it's not as hard as other forms, it's
going to be...

1660
02:11:14,959 --> 02:11:18,373
but it is susceptible to enchantment.

1661
02:11:18,373 --> 02:11:24,780
TALIESIN: Which is why I was going to then take
those to Pike. I don't entirely understand how

1662
02:11:24,780 --> 02:11:32,052
this works, but I had an idea. And I show her the
12 silver bearings, basically. Would you know how

1663
02:11:32,052 --> 02:11:34,677
to bless something like this?

1664
02:11:34,677 --> 02:11:37,075
ASHLEY: I could certainly try.

1665
02:11:37,075 --> 02:11:44,268
TALIESIN: I think this might come in handy. It's a
wild idea. I don't know. I'm trying to think of

1666
02:11:44,268 --> 02:11:48,179
surprising her with something.

1667
02:11:48,179 --> 02:11:51,753
ASHLEY: I think that's actually a fantastic idea.

1668
02:11:51,753 --> 02:11:58,944
TALIESIN: They're a bit hard to make, and they may
just not be useful at all, but I thought... I

1669
02:11:58,944 --> 02:12:01,463
don't know how any of this works.

1670
02:12:01,463 --> 02:12:07,819
ASHLEY: I'll see what I can do. Yeah. I'll see
what I can do.

1671
02:12:07,819 --> 02:12:09,764
TALIESIN: Thank you.

1672
02:12:09,764 --> 02:12:14,279
MATT: Okay. You take the silver shot. Anyone want
to try anything else?

1673
02:12:14,279 --> 02:12:19,261
LAURA: Yeah. I want to buy some holy oil, or get
some holy oil from the church, or something.

1674
02:12:19,261 --> 02:12:21,547
(laughter) Where do I get holy oil?

1675
02:12:21,547 --> 02:12:23,229
SAM: From the church.

1676
02:12:23,229 --> 02:12:27,084
LAURA: We've gotten holy oil before. I just can't
remember from where.

1677
02:12:27,084 --> 02:12:29,314
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1678
02:12:29,314 --> 02:12:34,126
LAURA: 21.

1679
02:12:34,126 --> 02:12:40,361
MATT: 21. "You look like you're looking for
something to buy."

1680
02:12:40,361 --> 02:12:45,314
LAURA: Oh, really? Larry, do you have any holy
oil?

1681
02:12:45,314 --> 02:12:56,543
MATT: "My lady. Do I? I happen to have one vial of
holy oil, good for two applications."

1682
02:12:56,543 --> 02:12:58,672
LAURA: All right. That's it? Just one?

1683
02:12:58,672 --> 02:13:03,182
MATT: "Traveled a long way, and you're a little
late in the shopping day. I was all full on them,

1684
02:13:03,182 --> 02:13:05,685
"but they've been flying off the shelf. My
apologies."

1685
02:13:05,685 --> 02:13:06,967
LAURA: Skeletons everywhere.

1686
02:13:06,967 --> 02:13:09,789
ASHLEY: Vex, I have some holy oil?

1687
02:13:09,789 --> 02:13:11,334
LAURA: How much?

1688
02:13:11,334 --> 02:13:16,607
ASHLEY: I don't know. I just have a vial of it. I
don't know how much that is.

1689
02:13:16,607 --> 02:13:19,429
LAURA: That's good for two applications, I think.

1690
02:13:19,429 --> 02:13:21,048
ASHLEY: Probably good for two applications.

1691
02:13:21,048 --> 02:13:23,199
MATT: Three applications with the vial that you
have.

1692
02:13:23,199 --> 02:13:27,255
LAURA: Oh, this one has a little bit missing? How
much? Because this is less than it normally is.

1693
02:13:27,255 --> 02:13:32,193
MATT: "Look, you've already done some good
business with me. I'll give it to you for 150."

1694
02:13:32,193 --> 02:13:34,927
SAM: But you have to sign this poster.

1695
02:13:34,927 --> 02:13:37,693
(laughter)

1696
02:13:37,693 --> 02:13:40,147
ASHLEY: For my Hawaiian poke bowl mascot.

1697
02:13:40,147 --> 02:13:42,583
(laughter)

1698
02:13:42,622 --> 02:13:46,115
TRAVIS: I would eat there all the time.

1699
02:13:46,115 --> 02:14:01,795
LAURA: 150 gold. Sure. Only because Percy gave me
a look. You know what-- yeah, okay.

1700
02:14:01,795 --> 02:14:03,182
MATT: All right.

1701
02:14:03,182 --> 02:14:05,449
TALIESIN: She's going to keep trying to listen to
one word.

1702
02:14:05,449 --> 02:14:07,235
MARISHA: A lot to unpack here.

1703
02:14:07,235 --> 02:14:13,024
MATT: I'm not hearing music. We'll check that in a
second. Anybody else want to prepare anything?

1704
02:14:13,024 --> 02:14:17,492
LIAM: Yeah. I want to track down Kynan for a
minute.

1705
02:14:17,492 --> 02:14:24,561
MATT: Okay. You find him. It's early morning.
They've finished their early round of training for

1706
02:14:24,561 --> 02:14:29,772
the morning, and some of the early Pale Guard
recruits are in the process of rushing off and

1707
02:14:29,772 --> 02:14:35,975
taking a small lunch break. He's currently taking
a lot of the equipment from the training grounds

1708
02:14:35,975 --> 02:14:43,160
and setting it aside in the various weapon racks,
and generally cleaning up the space as you

1709
02:14:43,160 --> 02:14:47,317
approach. He looks over his shoulder as he sets
some of the practice blades along the edge.

1710
02:14:47,317 --> 02:14:50,115
LIAM: Hey, brother man. How's all?

1711
02:14:50,115 --> 02:15:00,396
MATT: "Good. All's well. Just keeping things
going. Got a lot of good up-and-coming folks."

1712
02:15:00,396 --> 02:15:03,145
LIAM: You got all these ladies and gentlemen in
shape?

1713
02:15:03,145 --> 02:15:05,016
MATT: "Working on it. It's a process."

1714
02:15:05,016 --> 02:15:08,921
LIAM: I don't want to take up a lot of your time.
We just got in, and we're heading out again.

1715
02:15:08,921 --> 02:15:18,137
Anyway, I'm glad that I have Simon back, but I
feel bad because I gave it to you and I took it

1716
02:15:18,137 --> 02:15:25,691
away. But we're leaving, and I want to travel
light, so I wanted to make it up to you. I have

1717
02:15:25,691 --> 02:15:34,924
this. I'm going to give you this dagger. It's the
Keen Dagger. Take this. It's too much; I can't use

1718
02:15:34,924 --> 02:15:47,569
it. I've got this thing. Anyway. Just hold onto
it. That's it.

1719
02:15:47,569 --> 02:15:55,974
MATT: "Thank you very much. I'll keep it at my
side." He takes the basic dagger out of his sheath

1720
02:15:55,974 --> 02:15:58,243
and chucks it into the corner.

1721
02:15:58,243 --> 02:16:07,087
LIAM: Yeah. That one's better. And thanks, and I
think Percy's thankful, too. I think. You're doing

1722
02:16:07,087 --> 02:16:09,056
really good work here.

1723
02:16:09,056 --> 02:16:11,234
MATT: "Thank you. Thank you very much."

1724
02:16:11,234 --> 02:16:14,241
LIAM: Long, twisted road, but look where we are.
Look where you are.

1725
02:16:14,241 --> 02:16:18,655
MATT: "There's still a ways to go."

1726
02:16:18,655 --> 02:16:20,111
LIAM: Pat, pat.

1727
02:16:20,111 --> 02:16:21,277
LAURA: Pat, pat where?

1728
02:16:21,277 --> 02:16:22,730
LIAM: On his dick, obviously.

1729
02:16:22,730 --> 02:16:24,623
(laughter)

1730
02:16:24,623 --> 02:16:28,538
TRAVIS: The open palm?

1731
02:16:28,538 --> 02:16:38,078
LIAM: On his cheek. That's it. Anyway, you're
busy. We'll see you soon.

1732
02:16:38,078 --> 02:16:42,299
MATT: "I look forward to it. Stay safe."

1733
02:16:42,299 --> 02:16:45,735
LIAM: I will. Keep up the good work. (whoosh)

1734
02:16:45,735 --> 02:16:47,505
MATT: All right.

1735
02:16:47,505 --> 02:16:58,799
SAM: I guess Taryon will go find Vex. Stumble up
and say, I have to stay here and keep working on

1736
02:16:58,799 --> 02:17:01,230
Doty. I understand you're leaving today.

1737
02:17:01,230 --> 02:17:02,715
LAURA: You're not going to come with us?

1738
02:17:02,715 --> 02:17:09,773
SAM: I cannot. I have to stay and fix Doty and get
back to my home. I'm sorry. It's been a pleasure.

1739
02:17:09,773 --> 02:17:11,925
LAURA: Don't say it's been a pleasure!

1740
02:17:11,925 --> 02:17:18,938
SAM: It's been an honor to have your acquaintance,
and I'm afraid I have to return, but perhaps we'll

1741
02:17:18,938 --> 02:17:21,080
meet again sometime.

1742
02:17:21,080 --> 02:17:30,807
LAURA: I give him a big old hug. And I give
him...

1743
02:17:30,807 --> 02:17:32,791
LIAM: Three copper.

1744
02:17:32,791 --> 02:17:37,757
LAURA: I give him-- I don't have any feathers
left, I don't think.

1745
02:17:37,757 --> 02:17:39,446
SAM: Do you have any money?

1746
02:17:39,446 --> 02:17:41,915
(laughter)

1747
02:17:41,915 --> 02:17:43,834
LAURA: I have no money, Tary.

1748
02:17:43,834 --> 02:17:45,085
SAM: I need money.

1749
02:17:45,085 --> 02:17:48,055
TALIESIN: Technically speaking, you've been on
salary.

1750
02:17:48,055 --> 02:17:57,790
SAM: How about this? I wrote you a check. Can you
rip it up? I don't think I can pay it, ever.

1751
02:17:57,790 --> 02:18:01,746
(laughter)

1752
02:18:01,746 --> 02:18:05,322
LAURA: Tary, I ripped it up about two weeks after
you moved in.

1753
02:18:05,322 --> 02:18:10,250
SAM: Thank you. And you have no other money on
you?

1754
02:18:10,250 --> 02:18:16,531
LAURA: I open up my pouch, and I've got zero
personal gold. Just party funds.

1755
02:18:16,531 --> 02:18:23,144
SAM: Well, I feel like I should leave you with all
of my belongings, and all of my magical items, but

1756
02:18:23,144 --> 02:18:32,890
I need them for my brigade. I'll leave you with
the seashell crown that who gave me? Grog?

1757
02:18:32,890 --> 02:18:33,991
LAURA: Percy.

1758
02:18:33,991 --> 02:18:35,591
SAM: Percy gave me.

1759
02:18:35,591 --> 02:18:37,823
LAURA: I think he'd want you to have that.

1760
02:18:37,823 --> 02:18:45,421
SAM: Do you want the half of a geode rock with 30
living souls inside of it?

1761
02:18:45,421 --> 02:18:49,188
LAURA: Yeah, give it to me. Thanks, friend.

1762
02:18:49,188 --> 02:18:51,537
SAM: I can't use it.

1763
02:18:51,537 --> 02:18:54,438
LAURA: 30-soul rock. Got it.

1764
02:18:54,438 --> 02:18:57,862
MARISHA: 30 Rock Soul? (giggles)

1765
02:18:57,862 --> 02:19:02,484
TRAVIS: 30 souls just sitting in a rock. You think
my shit's weird?

1766
02:19:02,484 --> 02:19:05,170
SAM: Maybe I should have shown that to Pike
sometime in the last year?

1767
02:19:05,170 --> 02:19:07,222
LAURA: I will show it to her.

1768
02:19:07,222 --> 02:19:09,889
TALIESIN: That's just been sitting on your
bedside, hasn't it?

1769
02:19:09,889 --> 02:19:11,956
Slowly making the sound of crying.

1770
02:19:11,956 --> 02:19:17,061
MATT: If you get really close at night, you hear
this faint (screams).

1771
02:19:17,061 --> 02:19:19,002
LAURA: Help me!

1772
02:19:19,002 --> 02:19:21,247
MATT: He puts another pillow over it.

1773
02:19:21,247 --> 02:19:22,734
LAURA: What is that?

1774
02:19:22,734 --> 02:19:24,601
TALIESIN: Anything else?

1775
02:19:24,601 --> 02:19:28,556
SAM: Do you think you'll see Percy anytime soon?

1776
02:19:28,556 --> 02:19:30,027
LAURA: I think I might.

1777
02:19:30,027 --> 02:19:37,472
SAM: When you do, (pink) can you give him this
little gem for his flashlight? I can't spare many,

1778
02:19:37,472 --> 02:19:40,601
but that will give him one flashlight.

1779
02:19:40,601 --> 02:19:42,044
LAURA: Definitely.

1780
02:19:42,044 --> 02:19:46,103
TALIESIN: He'll have to come back, anyway, because
he doesn't know how to make the ammo for his gun.

1781
02:19:46,103 --> 02:19:48,534
LAURA: How are you going to get Doty home?

1782
02:19:48,534 --> 02:19:53,067
SAM: Well, after he's fixed, me and Chod--

1783
02:19:53,067 --> 02:19:56,573
LAURA: Right. Lionel. I think he likes to be
called Lionel.

1784
02:19:56,573 --> 02:20:03,257
SAM: I prefer Chod. I think we'll set off the
old-fashioned way.

1785
02:20:03,257 --> 02:20:07,821
LAURA: See who you pick up along the way?

1786
02:20:07,821 --> 02:20:11,013
SAM: Ooh! That could be chapter one of the new
book.

1787
02:20:11,013 --> 02:20:12,151
LAURA: Exactly.

1788
02:20:12,151 --> 02:20:16,887
SAM: Yes. A New Hope. Something like that.

1789
02:20:16,887 --> 02:20:19,538
LAURA: I like it. It's epic. Catchy.

1790
02:20:19,538 --> 02:20:26,925
SAM: Yes. Well, I'm not going to say have fun,
because you're going to a terrible place.

1791
02:20:26,925 --> 02:20:30,415
LAURA: We might not make it out alive. If you talk
to my brother, that's what he says.

1792
02:20:30,415 --> 02:20:31,866
He says it every time.

1793
02:20:31,866 --> 02:20:33,732
LIAM: I never said that.

1794
02:20:33,732 --> 02:20:42,323
SAM: If you die, I will be very upset. Hey, if I
die, your thing will glow, so that will be good.

1795
02:20:42,323 --> 02:20:44,092
LAURA: Same. So we'll know.

1796
02:20:44,092 --> 02:20:47,112
SAM: I'll see you sometime in Wildemount?

1797
02:20:47,112 --> 02:20:49,083
LAURA: Of course we'll come visit you.

1798
02:20:49,083 --> 02:20:50,215
SAM: All right.

1799
02:20:50,215 --> 02:20:51,551
LAURA: I love you so much.

1800
02:20:51,551 --> 02:20:56,685
SAM: You, too. Take care of your hair. You know,
you shouldn't wash it as often as you do. It just

1801
02:20:56,685 --> 02:20:58,155
makes it dry and flaky.

1802
02:20:58,155 --> 02:21:01,392
LAURA: The oil is helpful. Thank you.

1803
02:21:01,392 --> 02:21:04,061
SAM: Get it trimmed every two weeks.

1804
02:21:04,061 --> 02:21:05,495
LAURA: Right.

1805
02:21:05,495 --> 02:21:07,217
SAM: And have someone comb it.

1806
02:21:07,217 --> 02:21:10,700
LAURA: Yeah, I probably should do that, huh?

1807
02:21:10,700 --> 02:21:12,398
SAM: It's really disgusting sometimes.

1808
02:21:12,398 --> 02:21:17,291
LAURA: Okay. I'll brush it a hundred brush strokes
every night, just like you.

1809
02:21:17,291 --> 02:21:23,344
SAM: Thank you. All right. Goodbye. I'll see you
soon, Little Elf Girl.

1810
02:21:23,344 --> 02:21:29,881
LAURA: Bye, Goldie. (fake-cries)

1811
02:21:29,881 --> 02:21:35,218
MATT: All right, so what do you wish to do, guys?

1812
02:21:35,218 --> 02:21:43,605
ASHLEY: Is there a way that I can bless these
bullets?

1813
02:21:43,605 --> 02:21:48,959
TALIESIN: They're musket balls, technically.
They're not bullets.

1814
02:21:48,959 --> 02:21:55,886
MATT: It will take you a while to do so. You could
temporarily bless them with the Bless spell, but

1815
02:21:55,886 --> 02:22:01,293
to infuse them with the blessing would be the
equivalent of a small enchantment, so it would

1816
02:22:01,293 --> 02:22:05,207
take you a couple of days or something.

1817
02:22:05,207 --> 02:22:18,408
ASHLEY: Well, I could start it, depending on when
we leave, I guess. I have Bless. I was looking at

1818
02:22:18,408 --> 02:22:21,524
that, but I didn't know I could use that on actual
objects, other than people.

1819
02:22:21,524 --> 02:22:26,410
TALIESIN: We also have to modify one of the
necklaces.

1820
02:22:26,410 --> 02:22:30,351
LAURA: Yeah. That needs to go to a blacksmith, or
something?

1821
02:22:30,351 --> 02:22:36,171
MARISHA: Unless we want to go through the
old-fashioned way like the cultists did.

1822
02:22:36,171 --> 02:22:38,155
LIAM: The old-fashioned way?

1823
02:22:38,155 --> 02:22:40,609
LAURA: We can't Plane Shift unless we alter the
necklace.

1824
02:22:40,609 --> 02:22:43,537
TALIESIN: But we have enough necklaces that we
could just jump through.

1825
02:22:43,537 --> 02:22:44,880
TRAVIS: That one.

1826
02:22:44,880 --> 02:22:47,630
MARISHA: We might take a little bit of damage on
the way through.

1827
02:22:47,630 --> 02:22:48,981
TRAVIS: I'm game.

1828
02:22:48,981 --> 02:22:51,318
LAURA: You have a bajillion health points.

1829
02:22:51,318 --> 02:22:55,588
TRAVIS: I also thought of something overnight. All
right? It hurt, because it's kind of brilliant.

1830
02:22:55,588 --> 02:23:02,710
Can you hold your breath for-- (whispering) what's
higher than ten?

1831
02:23:02,710 --> 02:23:04,325
ASHLEY: (whispering) 11.

1832
02:23:04,325 --> 02:23:06,196
TRAVIS: 11 seconds.

1833
02:23:06,196 --> 02:23:07,216
SAM: Sure.

1834
02:23:07,216 --> 02:23:08,301
LAURA: Why?

1835
02:23:08,301 --> 02:23:13,287
TRAVIS: Why don't all you bitches just hop in the
Bag of Holding, I jump through, take all the

1836
02:23:13,287 --> 02:23:16,638
damage for us, and then you just (popping sounds)
pop right back out?

1837
02:23:16,638 --> 02:23:20,762
TALIESIN: I can think of many reasons why that's
probably not a good idea.

1838
02:23:20,762 --> 02:23:23,055
TRAVIS: What could it possibly be?

1839
02:23:23,055 --> 02:23:30,445
TALIESIN: The Bag of Holding is a negative space.
It's not designed to sustain life.

1840
02:23:30,445 --> 02:23:32,031
TRAVIS: Have you ever been in one?

1841
02:23:32,031 --> 02:23:35,942
TALIESIN: Very specifically not, because things
die in there.

1842
02:23:35,942 --> 02:23:41,572
LIAM: Grog, think of all the things you've pulled
out of there that look like sloppy joes, when they

1843
02:23:41,572 --> 02:23:43,227
didn't look like that going in.

1844
02:23:43,227 --> 02:23:46,729
LAURA: Let's put something living inside of there
and wait ten seconds and then take it out and see

1845
02:23:46,729 --> 02:23:48,094
if it's still alive.

1846
02:23:48,094 --> 02:23:50,752
TRAVIS: But it has to be able to hold its breath.
If we throw a dog in there--

1847
02:23:50,752 --> 02:23:53,422
ASHLEY: So if it breathes, it will die.

1848
02:23:53,422 --> 02:23:55,999
TRAVIS: Yeah, there's no air, I don't think.

1849
02:23:55,999 --> 02:24:02,612
LAURA: If it's ten seconds and it's not knowing to
hold its breath, it will come out alive, still.

1850
02:24:02,612 --> 02:24:04,966
TRAVIS: If you want to do CPR, whatever.

1851
02:24:04,966 --> 02:24:09,814
TALIESIN: What if the things inside take the
damage even if they are in the Bag of Holding?

1852
02:24:09,814 --> 02:24:11,596
TRAVIS: We should find out. Are you going in?

1853
02:24:11,596 --> 02:24:12,801
TALIESIN: No.

1854
02:24:12,801 --> 02:24:13,732
TRAVIS: I'll go in.

1855
02:24:13,732 --> 02:24:18,408
ASHLEY: You stick your hand in there all the time.
No?

1856
02:24:18,408 --> 02:24:22,043
TALIESIN: This is not a magic you want to be
messing around with.

1857
02:24:22,043 --> 02:24:24,809
TRAVIS: All right. I just wanted to put it out
there. We can all take the stones and go through.

1858
02:24:24,809 --> 02:24:27,460
I bet it's not going to be that bad of a deal.

1859
02:24:27,460 --> 02:24:31,648
TALIESIN: No, this is the fantasy equivalent of locking
yourself in a refrigerator.

1860
02:24:31,648 --> 02:24:37,618
TRAVIS: Just wanted to put it out there if you
wanted to live on the edge of life, but no, we'll

1861
02:24:37,618 --> 02:24:39,392
just do it the boring way.

1862
02:24:39,392 --> 02:24:43,323
TALIESIN: I feel comfortable with the level of
risk-taking of jumping into a giant sphere that

1863
02:24:43,323 --> 02:24:44,778
crushes anything it touches.

1864
02:24:44,778 --> 02:24:47,513
MARISHA: It's definitely a large amount of
risk-taking already.

1865
02:24:47,513 --> 02:24:54,668
LAURA: Can anybody tell if this plate is cursed?
Can you tell if something's cursed, bro?

1866
02:24:54,668 --> 02:24:55,816
SAM: Oh, the armor?

1867
02:24:55,816 --> 02:24:56,987
LIAM: No.

1868
02:24:56,987 --> 02:24:58,951
LAURA: Can you tell if something is cursed, Pike?

1869
02:24:58,951 --> 02:25:07,131
ASHLEY: I could try. Can I check it out and see if
it's cursed?

1870
02:25:07,131 --> 02:25:16,553
TRAVIS: That is a face that says, I'm giving you
nothing. (groans) Garlic chicken.

1871
02:25:16,553 --> 02:25:21,072
LAURA: Gross. Were you the one burping earlier,
too?

1872
02:25:21,072 --> 02:25:22,527
TRAVIS: I blew it that way, though.

1873
02:25:22,527 --> 02:25:25,982
LAURA: Yeah, but somebody burped in the first half
of the game, and it was foul.

1874
02:25:25,982 --> 02:25:27,449
TRAVIS: It's probably me.

1875
02:25:27,449 --> 02:25:32,283
TALIESIN: Careful where you aim that. You might
break a camera.

1876
02:25:32,283 --> 02:25:35,255
SAM: Let's go. Let's move!

1877
02:25:35,255 --> 02:25:38,477
LAURA: I'm trying to figure out if this plate mail
is cursed or not.

1878
02:25:38,477 --> 02:25:40,567
SAM: Who the fuck cares? We're going to a cursed
place.

1879
02:25:40,567 --> 02:25:42,762
LAURA: No, but it's so we can put it on somebody
here.

1880
02:25:42,762 --> 02:25:46,315
TALIESIN: Let's grab a bit of funds. Do we have
the group funds, as well?

1881
02:25:46,315 --> 02:25:47,866
We have access to the group funds.

1882
02:25:47,866 --> 02:25:49,518
SAM: You think one plate armor's going to do
anything?

1883
02:25:49,518 --> 02:25:53,096
MARISHA: Scanlan's back.

1884
02:25:53,096 --> 02:25:55,123
TRAVIS: Let's go.

1885
02:25:55,123 --> 02:25:56,540
LIAM: Guess who's back?

1886
02:25:56,540 --> 02:25:58,653
MARISHA: Hang on. Do we want to do a Heroes'
Feast?

1887
02:25:58,653 --> 02:25:59,839
TALIESIN: Not yet.

1888
02:25:59,839 --> 02:26:03,112
LAURA: Yeah, 'cause what if something's waiting for
us on the other side?

1889
02:26:03,112 --> 02:26:04,501
TALIESIN: What if nothing's waiting for us on the
other side?

1890
02:26:04,501 --> 02:26:05,919
Because now we're down one Heroes' Feast.

1891
02:26:05,919 --> 02:26:07,236
LAURA: Yeah, but what if there is?

1892
02:26:07,236 --> 02:26:08,403
TRAVIS: We've got a mansion.

1893
02:26:08,403 --> 02:26:09,888
TALIESIN: Then we dive into the mansion and we
have a Heroes' Feast.

1894
02:26:09,888 --> 02:26:12,473
LAURA: We've got to waste a fucking minute. We've
got to protect Scanlan for a minute.

1895
02:26:12,473 --> 02:26:13,919
TALIESIN: I think we're going to be okay.

1896
02:26:13,919 --> 02:26:15,222
LIAM: I'm with your beau.

1897
02:26:15,222 --> 02:26:23,071
TALIESIN: I think over-cautious. Even when jumping
into the depths of the undead, there's such a

1898
02:26:23,071 --> 02:26:24,500
thing as over-cautious.

1899
02:26:24,500 --> 02:26:27,347
TRAVIS: Let's go down to the ziggurat.

1900
02:26:27,347 --> 02:26:31,132
TALIESIN: I'm putting the-- as I hit the
microphone. Do not touch your microphone when you

1901
02:26:31,179 --> 02:26:33,332
put on your necklace. I'm putting on my necklace.

1902
02:26:33,332 --> 02:26:35,598
LAURA: Okay, I'll put on my necklace.

1903
02:26:35,598 --> 02:26:37,481
MATT: Each of you don one of the symbols?

1904
02:26:37,481 --> 02:26:38,501
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1905
02:26:38,501 --> 02:26:40,315
MARISHA: Do we need to put on the robes, too, that
we found?

1906
02:26:40,315 --> 02:26:41,870
LAURA: Fuck the robes.

1907
02:26:41,870 --> 02:26:44,270
TALIESIN: I want them to see me coming.

1908
02:26:44,270 --> 02:26:49,410
MARISHA: All right. Do you want the robes?

1909
02:26:49,410 --> 02:26:51,416
LIAM: I don't feel strongly about it.

1910
02:26:51,416 --> 02:26:53,962
TRAVIS: If we put on the robes, we've got to pull
out an eyeball each, too.

1911
02:26:53,962 --> 02:26:57,552
ASHLEY: We're already there? We're standing at the
ball?

1912
02:26:57,552 --> 02:27:00,438
LAURA: Are we going down? Sure.

1913
02:27:00,438 --> 02:27:04,655
TRAVIS: We're going down to the ziggurat.

1914
02:27:04,655 --> 02:27:11,127
MATT: All right. You find your way down into the
subterranean tunnels beneath Whitestone, winding

1915
02:27:11,127 --> 02:27:16,610
through the caverns until you enter the chamber
that contains the ziggurat where you initially

1916
02:27:16,610 --> 02:27:23,307
faced off with the Briarwoods. As you climb to the
top, there before you, you see standing in all of

1917
02:27:23,307 --> 02:27:31,010
its glory, the black, as you've called it,
spinning orb of death. Approximately that large

1918
02:27:31,010 --> 02:27:39,597
now, and it's this dark void, that as you get
close, it has this weird vibration to it. And

1919
02:27:39,597 --> 02:27:45,190
there it is, suspended about four feet off the
ground at the top of this ziggurat.

1920
02:27:45,190 --> 02:27:49,276
LAURA: Can I get close to it and put the necklace
near it without touching it?

1921
02:27:49,276 --> 02:27:55,784
MATT: Yeah. You put the necklace near it, and you
watch as the sphere, this weird grayish aura

1922
02:27:55,784 --> 02:28:03,093
around it begins to emanate faintly, almost like
the closer it gets, the brighter this weird gray

1923
02:28:03,093 --> 02:28:05,635
aura tends to get and the wider it grows.

1924
02:28:05,635 --> 02:28:07,094
LAURA: That seems promising.

1925
02:28:07,094 --> 02:28:08,672
LIAM: I'm right behind you.

1926
02:28:08,672 --> 02:28:10,258
TALIESIN: Who first?

1927
02:28:10,258 --> 02:28:11,963
LIAM: Me. (whoosh)

1928
02:28:11,963 --> 02:28:13,199
SAM: (screams)

1929
02:28:13,199 --> 02:28:14,011
MATT: All right.

1930
02:28:14,011 --> 02:28:15,213
TALIESIN: Well, that happened.

1931
02:28:15,213 --> 02:28:16,976
MATT: I would like you to make a constitution
saving throw.

1932
02:28:16,976 --> 02:28:21,054
MARISHA: Keyleth reaches for Vax right as he goes
in. Oh shit.

1933
02:28:21,054 --> 02:28:25,807
LIAM: I'll use my first Luck of the day. Wasn't
that bad, but it's an important roll. That's

1934
02:28:25,807 --> 02:28:27,856
better. 20.

1935
02:28:27,856 --> 02:28:30,547
MATT: 20. Okay.

1936
02:28:30,547 --> 02:28:33,966
TRAVIS: That's a lot of dice.

1937
02:28:33,966 --> 02:28:35,750
MARISHA: Oh Jesus, that's so many dice.

1938
02:28:35,750 --> 02:28:41,102
ASHLEY: (whispering) I thought we bamfed into it.

1939
02:28:41,102 --> 02:28:43,783
MARISHA: He twitched again.

1940
02:28:43,783 --> 02:28:53,791
MATT: You take 11 points of necrotic damage.
Anybody else?

1941
02:28:53,791 --> 02:28:55,400
MARISHA: Just that? That's it?

1942
02:28:55,400 --> 02:28:57,436
MATT: You don't know that. You just saw him
vanish.

1943
02:28:57,436 --> 02:29:01,289
TRAVIS: I'm game. I'll go.

1944
02:29:01,289 --> 02:29:05,375
MARISHA: All right.

1945
02:29:05,375 --> 02:29:08,841
MATT: Everybody going in?

1946
02:29:08,841 --> 02:29:10,114
MARISHA: Yeah, in.

1947
02:29:10,114 --> 02:29:12,770
MATT: All right. Everyone, make a constitution
saving throw, please.

1948
02:29:12,770 --> 02:29:19,249
SAM: Nine. No, 17.

1949
02:29:19,249 --> 02:29:20,839
MATT: 17.

1950
02:29:20,839 --> 02:29:22,569
TALIESIN: 23.

1951
02:29:22,569 --> 02:29:28,480
MATT: 22 points of necrotic damage. 11 points of
necrotic damage.

1952
02:29:28,480 --> 02:29:30,330
TRAVIS: Nine.

1953
02:29:30,330 --> 02:29:33,934
MATT: 22 points of necrotic damage. 22 points of
necrotic damage.

1954
02:29:33,934 --> 02:29:34,950
ASHLEY: Six.

1955
02:29:34,950 --> 02:29:36,604
MATT: 22 points of necrotic damage.

1956
02:29:36,604 --> 02:29:37,469
MARISHA: 16.

1957
02:29:37,469 --> 02:29:47,461
MATT: 22 points of necrotic damage. So as you leap
into the sphere, you feel as if the gravity that

1958
02:29:47,461 --> 02:29:52,895
holds you to the ground, or sometimes the ceiling,
bends around you and your limbs are wrenched

1959
02:29:52,895 --> 02:29:57,761
forward, like someone has you in a full Nelson
that doesn't end. Your body is about to be

1960
02:29:57,761 --> 02:30:04,609
condensed and crushed, when you feel the symbol
pulse, and the gravity lessens somewhat. It's

1961
02:30:04,609 --> 02:30:09,658
still tearing into you, and you feel this coldness
and this numbness come over your body, as you feel

1962
02:30:09,658 --> 02:30:15,463
like you're a square peg being pushed through a
round hole, physically pushed through against your

1963
02:30:15,463 --> 02:30:22,436
will. You begin to yell out in pain instinctually
before it comes to a stop and you all land to your

1964
02:30:22,436 --> 02:30:27,742
feet, out of breath. The numbness begins to fade
to immediate pins and needles, just pain across

1965
02:30:27,742 --> 02:30:33,385
your entire body. You feel like someone just raked
a number of tacks across every surface of your

1966
02:30:33,385 --> 02:30:40,174
skin and as the pain begins to throb, you can feel
the blood pulsing throughout your body as it all

1967
02:30:40,174 --> 02:30:47,020
shoots to the surface. You still sense that you,
thanks to your symbols around your neck, you

1968
02:30:47,020 --> 02:31:03,755
managed to withstand a much more dangerous
arrival. As your eyes focus, you already feel the

1969
02:31:03,755 --> 02:31:11,895
chilled air that surrounds you, like a cold, cold
winter morning. The sky above is sunless and gray,

1970
02:31:11,895 --> 02:31:19,637
like an overcast horizon without clouds to texture
it, breached by distant mountain ranges like so

1971
02:31:19,637 --> 02:31:31,605
much broken glass. You see behind you immediately
the other corresponding siphon, floating, bright

1972
02:31:31,605 --> 02:31:40,179
gray-white in color and glowing, the same color
that you saw briefly shifted to in the ziggurat

1973
02:31:40,179 --> 02:31:48,898
near Ank'harel. Beneath it, you find shards of
ruined objects, piles of long-dead bodies, flesh

1974
02:31:48,898 --> 02:31:53,667
and bone rended and twisted like they'd been put
through some rapid tornado on different sides of

1975
02:31:53,667 --> 02:31:59,153
their body. And you see a lot of these shattered
pieces of wood and metal were all a number of

1976
02:31:59,153 --> 02:32:02,757
objects that were thrown in here during the
experimental phase when you guys first uncovered

1977
02:32:02,757 --> 02:32:10,862
this. You look around and notice that you stand
atop a rectangular platform of dark, smooth stone,

1978
02:32:10,862 --> 02:32:17,287
about 15 feet on each side. Beneath the edges,
about 20 feet down, 'til it comes to the ground.

1979
02:32:17,287 --> 02:32:23,454
So you're on an elevated stone platform that the
siphon is affixed to above, floating about four

1980
02:32:23,454 --> 02:32:29,684
feet above the top of the surface. And you look
down to the ground immediately around you and you

1981
02:32:29,684 --> 02:32:36,197
see just dry, cracked badlands. It seems to spread
out, making up the majority of the Shadowfell

1982
02:32:36,197 --> 02:32:45,764
around you. Surrounding your location, your sight
clarifies to see what appears to be hundreds of

1983
02:32:45,764 --> 02:32:54,721
buildings and structures that form this shade of
an ancient city, like a town, a sprawling village.

1984
02:32:54,721 --> 02:33:01,423
Half the structures toppled and destroyed, piles
of rubble and rock. The ground itself seems to jut

1985
02:33:01,423 --> 02:33:08,394
up in places, these tiny, shooting spires of black
and gray earth that the city has either been built

1986
02:33:08,394 --> 02:33:18,917
around or seemed to have grown through. As you
look past that, you see movement throughout the

1987
02:33:18,917 --> 02:33:24,356
streets in the distance, but before you can focus
on that, your vision immediately sticks towards,

1988
02:33:24,356 --> 02:33:37,501
in the center of this circular-like city, the
standing, ominous, commanding, massive spire of

1989
02:33:37,501 --> 02:33:43,960
obsidian black, familiar to both of you through
two different types of vision you've experienced.

1990
02:33:43,960 --> 02:33:51,511
A jagged monolith that exudes ancient hatred,
encircled by dozens of dark, winged beasts that

1991
02:33:51,511 --> 02:34:02,087
watch over the dreary skies. Who here is
proficient in history?

1992
02:34:02,087 --> 02:34:06,508
LAURA: <i>Nobody</i> is proficient in history?!

1993
02:34:06,508 --> 02:34:08,430
SAM: We're doomed to repeat it.

1994
02:34:08,430 --> 02:34:11,382
TRAVIS: Really, Percy?

1995
02:34:11,382 --> 02:34:18,422
TALIESIN: No, I have other qualities, history was
not my forefront. I know Whitestone.

1996
02:34:18,422 --> 02:34:22,602
SAM: Somewhere, Taryon is reading a history book.

1997
02:34:22,602 --> 02:34:30,033
MATT: Exactly. The two of you make history checks
with disadvantage because you lack proficiency.

1998
02:34:30,033 --> 02:34:34,805
Yes, you being a bard, you pick up information in
passing. With disadvantage, each of you.

1999
02:34:34,805 --> 02:34:38,267
TALIESIN: Nine.

2000
02:34:38,267 --> 02:34:39,813
SAM: 11.

2001
02:34:39,813 --> 02:34:40,893
LAURA: Oh god.

2002
02:34:40,893 --> 02:34:42,223
SAM: That's a bad sign.

2003
02:34:42,223 --> 02:34:48,517
MATT: You have no inclination of where you stand
or what's before you. All you know is you stand

2004
02:34:48,517 --> 02:34:53,164
now on the cold plane of the Shadowfell, the echo
of the Prime Material.

2005
02:34:53,164 --> 02:34:56,838
LAURA: Our notes on the Shadowfell.

2006
02:34:56,838 --> 02:34:58,685
MATT: You do.

2007
02:34:58,685 --> 02:35:04,423
TALIESIN: Can we consult the Rand McNally?

2008
02:35:04,423 --> 02:35:07,359
TRAVIS: The Rand McNally guide, yeah.

2009
02:35:07,359 --> 02:35:10,017
MATT: You're welcome to. Just so you guys know,
you are all standing out in the middle of the

2010
02:35:10,017 --> 02:35:14,233
open, on this large stone platform looking down in
the center of this giant city--

2011
02:35:14,280 --> 02:35:18,283
LAURA: There are things that are moving below. I
see them.

2012
02:35:18,354 --> 02:35:20,185
MARISHA: And the ziggurat is above us?

2013
02:35:20,185 --> 02:35:24,520
MATT: There is no ziggurat. There is a large,
black spire, but that's in the center of the city

2014
02:35:24,520 --> 02:35:27,323
maybe two miles off.

2015
02:35:27,323 --> 02:35:29,973
LAURA: As we hop down, I cast Pass Without a Trace
on all of us.

2016
02:35:29,973 --> 02:35:34,213
LIAM: There are buildings around, so are we in the
middle of a field, a plain, badlands?

2017
02:35:34,213 --> 02:35:43,282
MATT: There are buildings. You see two structures
maybe 50 or 60 feet from you on each side, and

2018
02:35:43,282 --> 02:35:48,457
then going forward, from your current position, it
leads right into the city. So this structure is on

2019
02:35:48,457 --> 02:35:50,890
the outskirts. It's right on the perimeter.

2020
02:35:50,890 --> 02:35:53,480
LAURA: Do we see any other orbs around?

2021
02:35:53,480 --> 02:35:56,999
MATT: Make a perception check.

2022
02:35:56,999 --> 02:35:59,711
LAURA: 25.

2023
02:35:59,711 --> 02:36:09,705
MATT: You glance and, in the faint gray sky above
you, around the glowing white-gray orb this side

2024
02:36:09,705 --> 02:36:20,607
of the siphon, you see a very, very faint aura of
bluish-purple that is weaving into a thread, a

2025
02:36:20,607 --> 02:36:28,172
rope almost, various strands that knot and twist
to form a cord, a very barely visible cord that

2026
02:36:28,172 --> 02:36:33,881
just drifts up towards the very top of that tower
for miles. And there at the top of the tower, you

2027
02:36:33,881 --> 02:36:41,521
see a vibrant, sparking, pulsing, purple glow. And
from there, you can see two other distant strands

2028
02:36:41,521 --> 02:36:49,109
that arc off into the very faint other edges
across, triangulating around the other sides of

2029
02:36:49,109 --> 02:36:56,971
the outskirts of this ancient city. You see the
faint, glowing white-gray pulse of two other

2030
02:36:56,971 --> 02:37:03,054
siphons affixed to two other platforms, all these
strands converging at the top of the tower.

2031
02:37:03,054 --> 02:37:15,109
ASHLEY: Before we get to it, can I cast Bless on
his bullets so I can give them back to him?

2032
02:37:15,109 --> 02:37:16,979
MATT: How long does it last?

2033
02:37:16,979 --> 02:37:20,931
ASHLEY: Not very long.

2034
02:37:20,931 --> 02:37:25,853
MATT: You can. There's a difference between
casting a spell and enchanting something. It's a

2035
02:37:25,853 --> 02:37:28,972
loose enchantment to Bless the ammunition. That
takes a while to focus on.

2036
02:37:28,972 --> 02:37:31,917
TALIESIN: I imagine it'll take a few days when
it's done.

2037
02:37:31,917 --> 02:37:33,438
ASHLEY: When it's done.

2038
02:37:33,438 --> 02:37:37,070
TALIESIN: I don't expect us to be in and out of
here, I think this is going to take some time.

2039
02:37:37,070 --> 02:37:41,073
ASHLEY: I'd rather enchant them.

2040
02:37:41,073 --> 02:37:47,169
TRAVIS: The structures to our left and our right,
are they solid, do they have focus?

2041
02:37:47,169 --> 02:37:55,490
MATT: They're solid, they're stone buildings,
they're homes, though plain and cracked. There are

2042
02:37:55,490 --> 02:38:05,732
sections of wall missing in places. As you look
about the grounds here, and you know this because

2043
02:38:05,732 --> 02:38:14,701
you've ransacked and been responsible for the
ransacking... or the rubble of Westruun. But this

2044
02:38:14,701 --> 02:38:23,764
city appears to have been, some time long ago,
under siege. You see signs of battle, you see

2045
02:38:23,764 --> 02:38:34,490
impact, you see roofs that were burned and now lie as
just black husks. This area has seen warfare long

2046
02:38:34,490 --> 02:38:41,146
ago and the signs of it are old and it looks like
the signs of life that exist in this space, the

2047
02:38:41,146 --> 02:38:44,331
movement you see of figures in the distance
wandering through the streets, there's no

2048
02:38:44,331 --> 02:38:51,322
immediate threat to this city, but you get the
sense just looking out that something big happened

2049
02:38:51,322 --> 02:38:52,949
here a long time ago.

2050
02:38:52,949 --> 02:38:56,042
TRAVIS: Any of you with the eyes, can you see what
that is up in the air?

2051
02:38:56,042 --> 02:39:00,589
LAURA: Yeah, I also want to look and see what the
fuck kind of creatures it is that are moving

2052
02:39:00,589 --> 02:39:04,591
around in the city. But I want to see what kind of
creatures are flying around as well.

2053
02:39:04,591 --> 02:39:07,156
MATT: Okay, so you guys have moved down from the
platform, and you cast Pass Without a Trace, so

2054
02:39:07,156 --> 02:39:15,864
I'd like everyone to make a stealth check, please.
Adding plus ten to your roll.

2055
02:39:15,864 --> 02:39:16,949
SAM: 26.

2056
02:39:16,949 --> 02:39:18,109
TALIESIN: 22.

2057
02:39:18,109 --> 02:39:20,200
MARISHA: 27.

2058
02:39:20,200 --> 02:39:22,268
LIAM: 40.

2059
02:39:22,268 --> 02:39:26,699
LAURA: 23.

2060
02:39:26,699 --> 02:39:28,888
ASHLEY: 21.

2061
02:39:28,888 --> 02:39:30,188
TRAVIS: 18.

2062
02:39:30,188 --> 02:39:32,171
LAURA: Ooh shit, you rolled bad, yo!

2063
02:39:32,171 --> 02:39:40,246
MATT: Okay! So, to stay stealthed, you have to
find some place to be stealthy. You're not

2064
02:39:40,246 --> 02:39:44,084
stealthing out in the middle of nowhere. Where are
you going to find--

2065
02:39:44,084 --> 02:39:45,488
TALIESIN: Towards the city.

2066
02:39:45,488 --> 02:39:46,856
LAURA: Those buildings.

2067
02:39:46,856 --> 02:39:50,608
LIAM: Are we temporarily staying put and talking
shit out or are we going?

2068
02:39:50,608 --> 02:39:52,378
TALIESIN: The building on the left, I'd say.

2069
02:39:52,378 --> 02:39:54,097
LAURA: Yeah, like hide behind something.

2070
02:39:54,097 --> 02:39:59,738
MATT: Okay, you guys dart off to the left. It
appears to have once been a two-story structure,

2071
02:39:59,738 --> 02:40:08,124
but the upper level has since collapsed and part
of it is falling into the bottom floor. As you

2072
02:40:08,124 --> 02:40:14,973
begin to approach the doorway on the inside,
Vex'ahlia, you hear what sounds like a faint

2073
02:40:14,973 --> 02:40:17,115
crunching sound on the inside.

2074
02:40:17,115 --> 02:40:22,834
TRAVIS: (nervous laughter) What the fuck? Oh my
god.

2075
02:40:22,834 --> 02:40:24,788
LIAM: (whispering) What's the matter?

2076
02:40:24,788 --> 02:40:30,860
LAURA: (whispering) There's something in this
building. (louder) Are there windows on the

2077
02:40:30,860 --> 02:40:32,272
building, at all?

2078
02:40:32,272 --> 02:40:36,231
MATT: There are. There is one window on your side,
and the doorway around the corner.

2079
02:40:36,231 --> 02:40:38,149
LAURA: Peek in.

2080
02:40:38,149 --> 02:40:42,503
LIAM: I'll look in the window with my 40 stealth.

2081
02:40:42,503 --> 02:40:49,510
MATT: You glance inside, and as you peek over the
top, in the brief bits of light coming through the

2082
02:40:49,510 --> 02:40:56,448
shadow in here, you can see the collapsed piles of
broken stone and wood planks that used to hold the

2083
02:40:56,448 --> 02:41:01,965
structure of the upper level together. You can see
what looks like furniture that's been destroyed.

2084
02:41:01,965 --> 02:41:07,187
Simple, basic. This is not an
extravagantly decorated space. Built for function,

2085
02:41:07,187 --> 02:41:12,323
more than anything. But moving amidst the shadow,
you see what appears to be a humanoid creature of

2086
02:41:12,323 --> 02:41:21,484
pale gray skin, elongated limbs, long, clawed
fingers. Bald head, pointed, hooked ears, and what

2087
02:41:21,484 --> 02:41:26,708
looks to be slightly broken, jagged, yellow,
elongated teeth in this jaw, as it's currently

2088
02:41:26,708 --> 02:41:31,844
munching on what looks to be a small furred rodent
of some kind. (crunching)

2089
02:41:31,844 --> 02:41:35,898
LIAM: This is probably redundant, but I will
Divine Sense undead.

2090
02:41:35,898 --> 02:41:38,951
MATT: It is very undead.

2091
02:41:38,951 --> 02:41:44,522
LIAM: Do I sense, see, hear anything besides this
one?

2092
02:41:44,522 --> 02:41:46,023
MATT: What's the radius?

2093
02:41:46,023 --> 02:41:47,857
LIAM: 60 feet.

2094
02:41:47,857 --> 02:41:58,295
MATT: Nothing else catches your attention, no. You
watch as it finishes and walks toward the doorway.

2095
02:41:58,295 --> 02:42:06,184
Vex'ahlia, as you're off to the side, you watch as
this creature leans forward and goes into a

2096
02:42:06,184 --> 02:42:13,996
sprint, and then leaps up onto a distant rooftop.
(leaping noises) Just leaping from rooftop to

2097
02:42:13,996 --> 02:42:19,866
rooftop. As you're watching that leap, another
movement catches your eye, and you see another one

2098
02:42:19,866 --> 02:42:30,038
about three blocks down. You can see, there are at
least a handful of these creatures stalking

2099
02:42:30,038 --> 02:42:33,731
through the ruins, leaping from building to
building, from floor to floor.

2100
02:42:33,731 --> 02:42:35,483
ASHLEY: What was it eating?

2101
02:42:35,483 --> 02:42:41,093
MATT: A small, furred creature. You didn't get a good
look at it. You got a fair look at it.

2102
02:42:41,125 --> 02:42:45,947
TRAVIS: It was an otter. I love otters.

2103
02:42:45,947 --> 02:42:48,364
MATT: Apparently, so does the creature.

2104
02:42:48,364 --> 02:42:51,218
LAURA: Why would there be otters in the
Shadowfell?

2105
02:42:51,218 --> 02:42:53,627
MATT: There's something you didn't know about
otters, Laura.

2106
02:42:53,627 --> 02:42:56,682
MARISHA: They love holding hands?

2107
02:42:56,682 --> 02:43:07,479
LAURA: Does it look like any of those scary
creatures are around each other, or are they

2108
02:43:07,479 --> 02:43:08,868
avoiding each other?

2109
02:43:08,868 --> 02:43:12,515
MATT: It's hard to tell at this distance. You're
so far out of the city. You've only been able to

2110
02:43:12,515 --> 02:43:16,556
notice a few shapes from this distance. You'd
probably have to get in a little closer and spend

2111
02:43:16,556 --> 02:43:18,972
some time watching their behavior to pick that
up.

2112
02:43:18,972 --> 02:43:30,115
LIAM: I'm going to crouch down by this dead
rodent. Do I sense the Queen, more or less, here?

2113
02:43:30,115 --> 02:43:32,227
MATT: Make a wisdom check.

2114
02:43:32,227 --> 02:43:37,371
LIAM: 18.

2115
02:43:37,371 --> 02:43:44,322
MATT: You close your eyes for a second. No. None.

2116
02:43:44,322 --> 02:43:51,516
TRAVIS: Can I pop my head back out the door, and
looking at the ground, is there any semblance of a

2117
02:43:51,516 --> 02:43:55,236
sewer system or a runoff grate or anything?

2118
02:43:55,236 --> 02:43:58,206
MATT: Make a perception check.

2119
02:43:58,206 --> 02:44:03,643
TRAVIS: Oh Jesus. Yeah, bitch. Seven.

2120
02:44:03,643 --> 02:44:09,811
MATT: No. Not at all.

2121
02:44:09,811 --> 02:44:11,883
LAURA: Grog! Get your head back inside.

2122
02:44:11,883 --> 02:44:13,051
TRAVIS: What?

2123
02:44:13,051 --> 02:44:14,631
LAURA: There's things flying around out there.

2124
02:44:14,631 --> 02:44:16,006
TRAVIS: I'm keeping a lookout.

2125
02:44:16,006 --> 02:44:18,390
TALIESIN: I'm going to crawl up the wall to the
second floor to see what's up there.

2126
02:44:18,390 --> 02:44:27,074
MATT: As you go up the side and step over onto the
rubble, you see a large, broken, what was once the

2127
02:44:27,074 --> 02:44:34,728
floor of the top floor that slid into this giant
decline, this slide of rubble, if you will. At the

2128
02:44:34,728 --> 02:44:44,754
top, you can see what looks to be a broken weapon
rack that is empty. No weapons on it, but you get

2129
02:44:44,754 --> 02:44:49,983
the sense that this small structure was a
perimeter tower outpost.

2130
02:44:49,983 --> 02:44:52,174
TALIESIN: It's been cleaned out.

2131
02:44:52,174 --> 02:44:53,484
MATT: Apparently.

2132
02:44:53,484 --> 02:44:57,357
TALIESIN: There's no sign of anybody who used to
be here? Nothing of value, nothing of interest?

2133
02:44:57,357 --> 02:44:58,958
MATT: Not in the structure, no.

2134
02:44:58,958 --> 02:45:02,082
TALIESIN: I think we're going to have to move
deeper in.

2135
02:45:02,082 --> 02:45:04,161
SAM: Should I make us all ghoulie?

2136
02:45:04,161 --> 02:45:08,407
TRAVIS: Do we notice anything strange about the
little necklaces that we're wearing now that we're

2137
02:45:08,407 --> 02:45:09,861
in this place?

2138
02:45:09,861 --> 02:45:13,085
MATT: Nothing at the moment, no.

2139
02:45:13,085 --> 02:45:16,634
LIAM: Hey, you feeling good about your decision to
come with us?

2140
02:45:16,634 --> 02:45:28,115
SAM: This is terrible. I haven't had this much fun
in a long time. Let's go do it. I'll cast Seeming

2141
02:45:28,115 --> 02:45:39,191
on us and make us all gray, pointy-eared, little
Nosferatu-vampirey things, I suppose. Did I see

2142
02:45:39,191 --> 02:45:41,188
the thing that skittered out?

2143
02:45:41,188 --> 02:45:42,389
MATT: Very briefly.

2144
02:45:42,389 --> 02:45:44,729
SAM: I've seen other undead things.

2145
02:45:44,729 --> 02:45:47,973
MATT: Yeah. You can make something that looks
undead-adjacent.

2146
02:45:47,973 --> 02:45:56,356
SAM: Yeah. My guy will look more like the Meat Man
in undead form, but otherwise, everyone's normal.

2147
02:45:56,356 --> 02:46:04,355
LAURA: I want straggly, but still a braid. Really
nasty, straggly hair.

2148
02:46:04,355 --> 02:46:06,483
SAM: Your ear's half off.

2149
02:46:06,483 --> 02:46:11,484
TRAVIS: I definitely want an eyeball hanging out.

2150
02:46:11,484 --> 02:46:12,481
SAM: Sure.

2151
02:46:12,481 --> 02:46:16,821
TALIESIN: Straight hole right through the head. No
jaw.

2152
02:46:16,821 --> 02:46:18,272
SAM: Okay.

2153
02:46:18,272 --> 02:46:22,744
MATT: All right. What do you guys do?

2154
02:46:22,744 --> 02:46:28,260
LAURA: I think we should probably try to observe
the things that are flying around the tower.

2155
02:46:28,260 --> 02:46:31,348
TALIESIN: Slowly make our way to the town.

2156
02:46:31,348 --> 02:46:37,523
LAURA: Observe. Still try to avoid any of those
scary creatures, but see if they avoid each other

2157
02:46:37,523 --> 02:46:39,291
as we look at them.

2158
02:46:39,291 --> 02:46:41,240
LIAM: Super slow, super careful.

2159
02:46:41,240 --> 02:46:44,045
SAM: Maybe we should stagger.

2160
02:46:44,045 --> 02:46:47,950
LAURA: No, those things were speedy. Be normal.

2161
02:46:47,950 --> 02:46:49,934
SAM: We'll walk like this.

2162
02:46:49,934 --> 02:46:53,349
TALIESIN: Left, right, left, step, step, step.

2163
02:46:53,349 --> 02:46:57,138
(laughter)

2164
02:46:57,138 --> 02:47:06,681
MATT: Make a performance check. No.

2165
02:47:06,681 --> 02:47:13,996
MARISHA: While they were looking at weapons racks
and doing stuff like that--

2166
02:47:13,996 --> 02:47:16,757
TALIESIN: You make it sound so tawdry. Carry on.

2167
02:47:16,757 --> 02:47:27,231
MARISHA: While they were doing that, I pull Vax
aside. I grab him--

2168
02:47:27,231 --> 02:47:29,378
SAM: Let's get married.

2169
02:47:29,378 --> 02:47:32,935
LAURA: Let's just do it.

2170
02:47:32,935 --> 02:47:43,526
MARISHA: Goddamn it. Scanlan's back. Listen, you
can't die, and I don't know what's going on in

2171
02:47:43,526 --> 02:47:47,182
your head, or what you're thinking, but I feel
like it's not good.

2172
02:47:47,182 --> 02:47:53,800
LIAM: I'm the best I've ever been. Don't worry
about me. Worry about us.

2173
02:47:53,800 --> 02:47:56,205
MARISHA: Has the Raven Queen spoken to you at
all?

2174
02:47:56,205 --> 02:47:58,422
LIAM: Yes.

2175
02:47:58,422 --> 02:48:01,690
MARISHA: Recently? Down here?

2176
02:48:01,690 --> 02:48:04,941
LIAM: Not since we got here, no, but recently.

2177
02:48:04,941 --> 02:48:19,754
MARISHA: I need you with us. Not with her. I need
you with us, and with me. So let me do this. And

2178
02:48:19,754 --> 02:48:27,638
I'm going to burn my 9th-level spell and cast
Foresight on Vax.

2179
02:48:27,638 --> 02:48:29,418
SAM: Ooh, Foresight!

2180
02:48:29,418 --> 02:48:30,887
LAURA: What is that?

2181
02:48:30,887 --> 02:48:34,152
SAM: Shit. It's real good.

2182
02:48:34,152 --> 02:48:36,694
(laughter)

2183
02:48:36,694 --> 02:48:38,934
LIAM: This one goes to nine.

2184
02:48:38,934 --> 02:48:40,245
LAURA: What is Foresight?

2185
02:48:40,245 --> 02:48:44,982
MARISHA: Don't fuck it up, man. It's my 9th-level
spell.

2186
02:48:44,982 --> 02:48:51,365
MATT: For the next eight hours, not concentration,
you can't be surprised. You have advantage on all

2187
02:48:51,365 --> 02:48:55,557
attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws,
and other creatures have disadvantage on attack

2188
02:48:55,557 --> 02:48:56,743
rolls against you.

2189
02:48:56,743 --> 02:48:58,072
LAURA: Holy shit.

2190
02:48:58,072 --> 02:49:04,248
SAM: You can see just in the future. Three
seconds.

2191
02:49:04,248 --> 02:49:06,000
LAURA: That's amazing!

2192
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:09,251
LIAM: You guys, let's go shopping!

2193
02:49:09,251 --> 02:49:12,482
(laughter)

2194
02:49:12,482 --> 02:49:15,687
TRAVIS: I raise my blood axe...

2195
02:49:15,687 --> 02:49:20,246
MATT: All right.

2196
02:49:20,246 --> 02:49:25,364
SAM: Am I going to die in three seconds?
Am I going to die in three seconds?

2197
02:49:25,364 --> 02:49:30,821
(laughter)

2198
02:49:30,821 --> 02:49:34,238
TALIESIN: Let's make our way into town. Quietly.

2199
02:49:34,238 --> 02:49:36,055
LIAM: Within the next eight hours.

2200
02:49:36,055 --> 02:49:38,541
SAM: I feel like Vax should lead the party.

2201
02:49:38,541 --> 02:49:43,196
MATT: All right, so are you stealthing through?

2202
02:49:43,196 --> 02:49:44,448
TALIESIN: Yes.

2203
02:49:44,448 --> 02:49:46,493
LAURA: Still being stealthy, but yeah.

2204
02:49:46,493 --> 02:49:48,816
LIAM: Looking cool, but stealthing.

2205
02:49:48,816 --> 02:49:50,821
MARISHA: We look so cool.

2206
02:49:50,821 --> 02:49:52,720
TALIESIN: We're not doing--

2207
02:49:52,720 --> 02:49:55,054
LAURA: Matt's like, I will kill you all.

2208
02:49:55,054 --> 02:50:02,561
MATT: You guys scatter just enough to dart between
alleys and find shaded bits and leap from base of

2209
02:50:02,603 --> 02:50:13,551
building to alley, keeping a cohesive unit as best
you can. The first thing you notice, the further

2210
02:50:13,551 --> 02:50:21,887
in you get, even within just the first couple of
blocks of the city, you see broken swords, you see

2211
02:50:21,887 --> 02:50:33,986
pieces of armor, and you see figures walking
through the street ahead of you. You see hundreds

2212
02:50:33,986 --> 02:50:49,477
of scattered skeletons, decomposing bodies
shambling through, but they all walk in patterns.

2213
02:50:49,477 --> 02:50:58,541
They're not scattered, mindless. There is some
will or direction to their movements. You see them

2214
02:50:58,541 --> 02:51:06,995
wearing ornate armor with designs and symbols on
them that look old and tarnished and scratched.

2215
02:51:06,995 --> 02:51:12,352
LIAM: Are they moving like troops or is each
individual following its own...?

2216
02:51:12,352 --> 02:51:17,740
MATT: Some are moving as troops, and occasionally
you see an individual wander off, but they're just

2217
02:51:17,740 --> 02:51:28,914
sort of walking around and scanning. I'm going to
have Scanlan, you roll a history check, and Pike,

2218
02:51:28,914 --> 02:51:30,583
roll a religion check.

2219
02:51:30,583 --> 02:51:45,913
SAM: 17. Oh! You know what, seems important, I
will inspire myself. Can I do that? I haven't done

2220
02:51:45,913 --> 02:51:47,416
this in so long.

2221
02:51:47,416 --> 02:51:50,077
MATT: Yeah, add a d12 to it.

2222
02:51:50,077 --> 02:51:52,470
SAM: 18.

2223
02:51:52,470 --> 02:51:56,188
MATT: Got to get the dust off, man.

2224
02:51:56,188 --> 02:51:58,056
ASHLEY: 23.

2225
02:51:58,056 --> 02:52:11,099
MATT: Okay. You, looking over there, a lot of the
armor that these skeletons are wearing, it doesn't

2226
02:52:11,099 --> 02:52:26,013
fit with the Shadowfell. The silvers, the golds,
the tattered blue cloaks, there's something regal

2227
02:52:26,013 --> 02:52:32,320
about some of these armor sets, as old and ancient
as they may be. It doesn't seem to match the sense

2228
02:52:32,320 --> 02:52:37,069
and feel of the Shadowfell. While you're having
this thought, Pike, you glance over and look at

2229
02:52:37,069 --> 02:52:43,736
one of these pieces of armor and you recognize the
symbol, it's like a stained-glass circle with a

2230
02:52:43,736 --> 02:52:56,605
gold star in the center. It's the symbol of Pelor.
Many of these bodies, these undead wandering the

2231
02:52:56,605 --> 02:53:04,555
city, seem to have been soldiers that fell in
whatever battle that once besieged this city, and

2232
02:53:04,555 --> 02:53:06,681
many bear the mark of Pelor.

2233
02:53:06,681 --> 02:53:09,858
TALIESIN: I mean, the Chained--

2234
02:53:09,858 --> 02:53:12,764
LAURA: The Chained Oblivion.

2235
02:53:12,764 --> 02:53:16,046
TALIESIN: The Chained Oblivion, there was a fight
between.

2236
02:53:16,046 --> 02:53:22,516
MATT: That was, but that was on the Prime
Material, and that was in the vicinity of the

2237
02:53:22,516 --> 02:53:24,140
Alabaster Sierras.

2238
02:53:24,140 --> 02:53:28,274
TALIESIN: That mark couldn't have ended up--

2239
02:53:28,274 --> 02:53:30,605
LAURA: Was the Shadowfell always the Shadowfell?

2240
02:53:30,605 --> 02:53:32,169
TALIESIN: I don't know.

2241
02:53:32,169 --> 02:53:37,599
SAM: Maybe this city was taken somewhere else or
something. Transported here.

2242
02:53:37,599 --> 02:53:40,597
MARISHA: Does this city look like Whitestone?

2243
02:53:40,597 --> 02:53:46,469
MATT: No. None of the buildings, the structures,
resemble Whitestone.

2244
02:53:46,469 --> 02:53:53,282
SAM: Is there any architecture that I, or anyone,
notices, like from a region of where we've been?

2245
02:53:53,282 --> 02:54:02,367
MATT: No. Not really.

2246
02:54:02,367 --> 02:54:04,349
SAM: Mid-century modern, mostly?

2247
02:54:04,349 --> 02:54:16,954
MATT: Yeah, yeah, lot of Ikea. No, but you do get
the sense-- some of the architecture here does

2248
02:54:16,954 --> 02:54:26,272
resemble elements of some architecture designs
that remind you of Wildemount.

2249
02:54:26,272 --> 02:54:28,864
SAM: Man, we should have brought Tary.

2250
02:54:28,864 --> 02:54:46,382
MATT: But, like, old Wildemount. Like, no modern
structures, definitely from centuries back. As you

2251
02:54:46,382 --> 02:54:50,280
continue to wander and keep your eyes out, you
occasionally hear the distant (creature

2252
02:54:50,280 --> 02:55:00,561
shrieking). You watch as the (wings flapping)
winged, dark beasts are circling overhead.

2253
02:55:00,561 --> 02:55:01,999
SAM: Do we recognize them?

2254
02:55:01,999 --> 02:55:03,390
MATT: No, not yet.

2255
02:55:03,390 --> 02:55:04,825
LAURA: Never seen anything like it?

2256
02:55:04,825 --> 02:55:10,163
MATT: You have not seen anything like these
before. Black as night against the gray sky. From

2257
02:55:10,163 --> 02:55:16,200
this distance, you make out no details in their
bodies. It's almost like a moving shadow above

2258
02:55:16,200 --> 02:55:25,685
you. Wherever light would hit to give you some
sense of structure, it's just absence, void. It's

2259
02:55:25,685 --> 02:55:27,741
just a flying shadow.

2260
02:55:27,741 --> 02:55:33,115
TALIESIN: Are there any buildings that have enough
structure to them where it feels like there might

2261
02:55:33,115 --> 02:55:36,701
be things inside that have been relatively
unmolested at this point?

2262
02:55:36,701 --> 02:55:40,708
MATT: Possibly. Make a perception check.

2263
02:55:40,708 --> 02:55:48,427
TALIESIN: 12.

2264
02:55:48,427 --> 02:55:53,109
MATT: 12. I mean, there are some buildings that
look like they have some structure, and the

2265
02:55:53,109 --> 02:55:58,482
further into the city you get, the more you see
that this becomes a little less destroyed. But you

2266
02:55:58,482 --> 02:56:03,318
begin to see some figures moving that are not
armored undead, not zombies, and not any of these

2267
02:56:03,318 --> 02:56:09,710
quick-moving creatures. You see three figures
walking back towards the orb where you guys came

2268
02:56:09,710 --> 02:56:18,317
from in the same black cult robes, hoods off. They
would appear to be human.

2269
02:56:18,317 --> 02:56:19,999
TALIESIN: But they're cultists.

2270
02:56:19,999 --> 02:56:21,556
MATT: But they're cultists.

2271
02:56:21,556 --> 02:56:24,337
LAURA: They don't look like they're afraid of
walking around?

2272
02:56:24,337 --> 02:56:25,777
LIAM: Yeah, what's their demeanor?

2273
02:56:25,777 --> 02:56:27,746
MATT: They're just walking through.

2274
02:56:27,746 --> 02:56:29,291
LIAM: How far are they from us?

2275
02:56:29,291 --> 02:56:33,925
MATT: They're about 100 feet up. A little further
than that.

2276
02:56:33,925 --> 02:56:35,317
LIAM: Coming our way?

2277
02:56:35,317 --> 02:56:38,603
MATT: Coming your way towards the sphere where you
guys were.

2278
02:56:38,603 --> 02:56:40,455
ASHLEY: Maybe that's what we need to look like.

2279
02:56:40,455 --> 02:56:41,766
TRAVIS: Cover and ambush?

2280
02:56:41,766 --> 02:56:44,726
LIAM: Or watch, see what they're doing.

2281
02:56:44,726 --> 02:56:46,761
TALIESIN: Kill two, keep one to question?

2282
02:56:46,761 --> 02:56:48,865
MARISHA: How many are there, three?

2283
02:56:48,865 --> 02:56:49,909
MATT: Three of them.

2284
02:56:49,909 --> 02:56:51,985
TALIESIN: God, can we even kill people here? Will
they die?

2285
02:56:51,985 --> 02:56:56,801
LIAM: Yes. But do we watch, see what they do with
the sphere first?

2286
02:56:56,801 --> 02:56:58,484
TALIESIN: Let's cut them off.

2287
02:56:58,484 --> 02:57:05,092
SAM: I could be bait. Then you could come ambush
them.

2288
02:57:05,092 --> 02:57:08,311
LIAM: Let's watch for a moment longer.

2289
02:57:08,311 --> 02:57:10,080
TRAVIS: Find cover.

2290
02:57:10,080 --> 02:57:14,250
MATT: Okay. So what do you guys do?

2291
02:57:14,250 --> 02:57:15,762
TRAVIS: I'm going into the building.

2292
02:57:15,762 --> 02:57:18,559
LAURA: I'm following them, just subtly.

2293
02:57:18,559 --> 02:57:20,290
MARISHA: Yeah, let the twins go ahead first.

2294
02:57:20,290 --> 02:57:22,966
MATT: Okay, so the two twins follow and the rest
of you duck into a building off to the side? Okay.

2295
02:57:22,966 --> 02:57:26,747
You guys, I need you both individually to roll
stealth as you tail behind them.

2296
02:57:26,747 --> 02:57:35,413
LAURA: And we still have Pass Without a Trace on.
34.

2297
02:57:35,413 --> 02:57:37,643
LIAM: 45.

2298
02:57:37,643 --> 02:57:41,992
SAM: Wait, we're staying put and they're walking
off somewhere else? How are we going to see what's

2299
02:57:41,992 --> 02:57:42,991
going to happen?

2300
02:57:42,991 --> 02:57:44,356
TRAVIS: They were walking towards us.

2301
02:57:44,356 --> 02:57:48,635
MATT: The cultists are basically walking past you
guys, going the opposite direction of where you

2302
02:57:48,635 --> 02:57:56,701
were traveling, and both the twins just vanish
from sight. You're like, "Well what if-- Gone

2303
02:57:56,701 --> 02:58:03,757
again." You guys pace behind them, jumping from
alley to alley. Occasionally they'll stop and do a

2304
02:58:03,757 --> 02:58:10,449
walk over. There's not a sense of paranoia, but
they're very watchful. Their attire, while still

2305
02:58:10,449 --> 02:58:15,380
cult robes, is a little more intricately adorned,
and you see the one in the front is carrying a

2306
02:58:15,380 --> 02:58:19,303
hanging lantern that gives off this weird smoke
behind it, like a censer.

2307
02:58:19,303 --> 02:58:21,777
TRAVIS: A censer?

2308
02:58:21,777 --> 02:58:24,394
LIAM: Yeah, like a Catholic.

2309
02:58:24,394 --> 02:58:33,219
MATT: Yeah. But it gives off this faint glow, and
they walk and make their way slowly outside of the

2310
02:58:33,219 --> 02:58:42,689
city towards the pillar where the orb is. And they
just look around it, walk over to the few

2311
02:58:42,689 --> 02:58:48,443
buildings to the side, divide a little bit to a
perimeter, reconvene at the base of the orb, and

2312
02:58:48,443 --> 02:58:51,051
begin making their way back to the center of the
city.

2313
02:58:51,051 --> 02:58:53,803
LAURA: Is there anything else around? Should we
kill them?

2314
02:58:53,803 --> 02:58:59,841
LIAM: All three? Take one? Kill two, leave one?

2315
02:58:59,841 --> 02:59:02,189
SAM: We can ambush them.

2316
02:59:02,189 --> 02:59:04,333
LAURA: Get ready for an ambush.

2317
02:59:04,333 --> 02:59:06,413
TALIESIN: When they walk by the house, push them.

2318
02:59:06,413 --> 02:59:09,065
LAURA: When they walk past you guys, we'll
attack.

2319
02:59:09,065 --> 02:59:14,516
SAM: Should I put someone out there to confuse
them?

2320
02:59:14,516 --> 02:59:16,716
LIAM: No. When we go, follow suit.

2321
02:59:16,716 --> 02:59:19,727
MARISHA: I can Grasping Vine one into the
building, right into Grog's hands.

2322
02:59:19,727 --> 02:59:23,924
LAURA: Wait until we attack them first.

2323
02:59:23,924 --> 02:59:31,769
MATT: All right. The three of them walk back,
leaving a small censer trail behind. The smoke,

2324
02:59:31,769 --> 02:59:39,568
the almost incense-like smoke, burns off within a
few feet after. They eventually cross right next

2325
02:59:39,568 --> 02:59:45,130
to the doorway and window to where the rest of you
are waiting. Both of you guys roll for an attack.

2326
02:59:45,130 --> 02:59:47,378
Are you aiming at two different ones? Same one?

2327
02:59:47,378 --> 02:59:52,121
LAURA: Two different ones. And it's an
automatic...

2328
02:59:52,121 --> 02:59:56,236
MATT: It's an automatic crit if you hit, and you
have advantage on the hit

2329
02:59:56,236 --> 02:59:57,891
because they don't see you.

2330
02:59:57,891 --> 03:00:04,912
LAURA: Natural 20. Not that it matters, because I
already got a crit.

2331
03:00:04,912 --> 03:00:06,480
MATT: But still, it's nice.

2332
03:00:06,480 --> 03:00:11,055
LIAM: 26.

2333
03:00:11,055 --> 03:00:17,536
MATT: 26. Both hit. Go ahead and roll damage, both
of you, doubling your weapon die damage and your

2334
03:00:17,536 --> 03:00:18,639
sneak attack.

2335
03:00:18,639 --> 03:00:20,212
LAURA: Bramble shot.

2336
03:00:20,212 --> 03:00:21,812
SAM: There's three of them, right?

2337
03:00:21,812 --> 03:00:38,038
MATT: Three of them, yes... You also double the
bramble shot damage because it's a crit.

2338
03:00:38,038 --> 03:00:44,645
SAM: Hey, look, we're killing things! Well,
maybe.

2339
03:00:44,645 --> 03:00:47,527
TALIESIN: Incapacitating, at the very least.

2340
03:00:47,527 --> 03:00:48,549
LIAM: 85.

2341
03:00:48,549 --> 03:00:49,951
LAURA: Oh, shit, dude.

2342
03:00:49,951 --> 03:00:51,444
SAM: 85?

2343
03:00:51,444 --> 03:00:55,472
MATT: 85 damage. Rogues, man. It's what they do.

2344
03:00:55,472 --> 03:00:58,287
TALIESIN: The head is cleaved from the body.

2345
03:00:58,287 --> 03:01:00,760
LAURA: 56 for me.

2346
03:01:00,760 --> 03:01:05,778
SAM: It was Kima and Allura on a mission. They're
dead.

2347
03:01:05,778 --> 03:01:12,283
MATT: As the three of them walk, the two on the
outside both, at the same time, (impacts),

2348
03:01:12,283 --> 03:01:19,670
crumple. No noise, just fall to their knees, face
down on the ground, unmoving. The one in the

2349
03:01:19,670 --> 03:01:24,361
center that's holding the censer turns and looks
back and sees--

2350
03:01:24,361 --> 03:01:28,849
MARISHA: And I go (whoosh) and Grasping Vine him,
and throw him right into Grog's hands.

2351
03:01:28,893 --> 03:01:30,132
LAURA: Don't kill him!

2352
03:01:30,132 --> 03:01:35,018
TRAVIS: And if he's successfully thrown, I just
cover his mouth and

2353
03:01:35,018 --> 03:01:37,018
grab the back of his head and squeeze.

2354
03:01:37,018 --> 03:01:38,808
SAM: Which mouth?

2355
03:01:38,808 --> 03:01:42,161
TRAVIS: Ew, God.

2356
03:01:42,161 --> 03:01:44,258
MATT: That is a 16.

2357
03:01:44,258 --> 03:01:45,312
MARISHA: Fail.

2358
03:01:45,312 --> 03:01:50,818
MATT: Fail. That's right, because 21. So as soon
as he turns around, out of one of the cracks in

2359
03:01:50,818 --> 03:01:55,673
the stonework nearby, you can see some dry,
grass-like gray brush. There is what appears to be

2360
03:01:55,673 --> 03:02:04,154
some faint hints of local plant life, but it all
looks like gray, dry grass. Or, you know after a

2361
03:02:04,154 --> 03:02:10,551
morning freeze, when you see elements of a field
that have that weird, textured, almost water plant

2362
03:02:10,551 --> 03:02:16,924
look to it? It's clusters of that, but curled. And
one of those whips out with this one, long,

2363
03:02:16,924 --> 03:02:22,880
grayish, almost fleshy-looking vine that wraps
around it and yanks it inside the house. (grunt)

2364
03:02:22,880 --> 03:02:25,845
Gets yanked in. Grog, you catch him.

2365
03:02:25,886 --> 03:02:27,255
TRAVIS: Cover his mouth.

2366
03:02:27,255 --> 03:02:28,840
LIAM: Like clockwork.

2367
03:02:28,840 --> 03:02:33,962
MATT: Go ahead and make an athletics check, Grog.

2368
03:02:33,962 --> 03:02:38,497
TRAVIS: Oh, that's a million. 26.

2369
03:02:38,497 --> 03:02:46,204
MATT: He struggles against your grasp, and it's
nothing. It's like holding a baby in your arms.

2370
03:02:46,204 --> 03:02:50,088
TRAVIS: Percy, will you give him a reminder not to
move?

2371
03:02:50,088 --> 03:02:57,400
TALIESIN: Oh, yes, this will be fun. I take out a
small, three-inch steel ball. I look him right in

2372
03:02:57,400 --> 03:03:06,813
the eye, and go, Manners. And I toss the steel
ball at our friend. The iron bands.

2373
03:03:06,813 --> 03:03:09,912
MATT: Okay. What does he have to save on that?

2374
03:03:09,912 --> 03:03:13,436
TALIESIN: I actually make a ranged attack roll.

2375
03:03:13,436 --> 03:03:18,881
MATT: Okay, make a ranged attack roll. d20 plus
your dexterity. You have advantage because he's

2376
03:03:18,881 --> 03:03:20,153
currently restrained by Grog.

2377
03:03:20,153 --> 03:03:26,944
TALIESIN: Makes me feel better. Thank God. That's
still fine. 23.

2378
03:03:26,944 --> 03:03:31,695
MATT: Okay, so as you chuck it the three feet, it
impacts, and you watch as the orb swells and

2379
03:03:31,695 --> 03:03:38,419
expands, and all of these chain-like plates of
dark, reddish iron metal wrap around him,

2380
03:03:38,419 --> 03:03:42,302
constraining his hands, his legs, and locking him
into place around his jaw

2381
03:03:42,302 --> 03:03:43,798
and his head and his mouth.

2382
03:03:43,798 --> 03:03:47,243
TALIESIN: Excellent.

2383
03:03:47,243 --> 03:03:48,529
LAURA: Can he still talk?

2384
03:03:48,529 --> 03:03:50,417
TRAVIS: Yeah, when I take my hand off his mouth.

2385
03:03:50,417 --> 03:03:54,303
TALIESIN: This thing will allow him to talk. I
believe this thing has a...

2386
03:03:54,303 --> 03:03:57,469
MATT: It has a little slit that you can remove to
the side.

2387
03:03:57,469 --> 03:03:59,667
LIAM: It's got a gimp hole?

2388
03:03:59,667 --> 03:04:07,110
MATT: All good magical items do, Liam. That's what
you call an artifact.

2389
03:04:07,110 --> 03:04:12,127
TALIESIN: I give him a second to sit and I wait
until we're all inside.

2390
03:04:12,127 --> 03:04:14,708
MATT: Okay. You guys both attacked.

2391
03:04:14,708 --> 03:04:16,403
LAURA: Pull the bodies inside.

2392
03:04:16,403 --> 03:04:20,462
MATT: First make a stealth check, because you both
exposed yourselves with the attack, and there are

2393
03:04:20,462 --> 03:04:22,097
creatures overhead shrieking.

2394
03:04:22,097 --> 03:04:26,347
TALIESIN: With advantage. He has advantage.

2395
03:04:26,347 --> 03:04:28,688
LIAM: Plus Pass Without Trace.

2396
03:04:28,688 --> 03:04:29,890
LAURA: 35.

2397
03:04:29,890 --> 03:04:32,294
LIAM: 37, that's kind of low for me.

2398
03:04:32,294 --> 03:04:38,833
MATT: Okay. You watch as one swoops nearby, and
you hear the (shrieking), and you guys dart by.

2399
03:04:38,833 --> 03:04:44,105
Doesn't seem to take notice. You drop back into
the building, and there you see your quarry now

2400
03:04:44,105 --> 03:04:47,590
bolted to himself through a series of dark iron
metal plates.

2401
03:04:47,590 --> 03:04:50,470
TRAVIS: Our quarry, does he have two eyes?

2402
03:04:50,470 --> 03:04:59,146
MATT: He does not have both eyes. Left eye is
missing. You see him now. This is a man in his

2403
03:04:59,146 --> 03:05:05,957
mid-40s, salt and pepper hair, seems to be an
unkempt beard around his chin. Hair is maybe about

2404
03:05:05,957 --> 03:05:14,586
ear-length, a little tattered now since he's been
roughed up and manhandled a bit. His skin's a bit

2405
03:05:14,586 --> 03:05:20,879
yellowed, a little jaundiced. You get the sense
he's probably been living here for quite some

2406
03:05:20,879 --> 03:05:24,605
time, and he doesn't look healthy.

2407
03:05:24,605 --> 03:05:29,050
LAURA: I grab the thing that was making the smoke
and bring it.

2408
03:05:29,087 --> 03:05:42,122
MATT: The smell is awful. It's hard to
differentiate from the general smell of decay and

2409
03:05:42,122 --> 03:05:49,219
dust that this entire realm seems to be suffused
with, but the smoke that billows off of this is

2410
03:05:49,219 --> 03:05:58,087
like fresh putrescence, mixed with a very, very
strong charcoal.

2411
03:05:58,087 --> 03:06:01,235
TALIESIN: This may be how they move freely.

2412
03:06:01,235 --> 03:06:05,292
LAURA: That's what I'm thinking. We hide the
bodies. We'll bring the bodies inside, too, so

2413
03:06:05,292 --> 03:06:07,046
that nobody sees them.

2414
03:06:07,046 --> 03:06:08,848
LIAM: Press him.

2415
03:06:08,848 --> 03:06:23,046
TALIESIN: I'm going to let you speak, and we're
going to have a conversation. Given where you are,

2416
03:06:23,046 --> 03:06:30,571
the circumstances that we find you in, I'm going
to let you know that there is a curse upon my

2417
03:06:30,571 --> 03:06:40,242
weapon, and the souls that are killed with this
weapon are claimed by a demon named Orthax. Now, I

2418
03:06:40,242 --> 03:06:45,442
haven't experimented as to what happens when
somebody's soul is claimed by more than one

2419
03:06:45,442 --> 03:06:52,938
creature, but I'm excited to find out. So wouldn't
it be interesting if everything you've been

2420
03:06:52,938 --> 03:07:02,528
promised here is suddenly null and void? So, yes,
we may threaten your life, but I want you to know

2421
03:07:02,528 --> 03:07:11,378
that what's really at stake here is just precisely
what's left of your soul, so answer with caution.

2422
03:07:11,378 --> 03:07:13,871
And I unlock.

2423
03:07:13,871 --> 03:07:16,228
MATT: Roll an intimidation check.

2424
03:07:16,228 --> 03:07:22,777
TRAVIS: That was nasty, it was real good.

2425
03:07:22,777 --> 03:07:35,971
TALIESIN: Fucking dice. No love on that one.
Terrible. Eight.

2426
03:07:35,971 --> 03:07:47,473
MATT: You unlock, and he just goes (laughs) "I
don't have to tell you anything."

2427
03:07:47,473 --> 03:07:57,308
LIAM: I punch him in the temple.

2428
03:07:57,308 --> 03:08:05,720
MATT: "This pain is meager. I've felt far worse.
I've given myself far worse.

2429
03:08:05,720 --> 03:08:08,569
"Pry and poke all you want."

2430
03:08:08,569 --> 03:08:10,290
LIAM: I punch him in the mouth.

2431
03:08:10,290 --> 03:08:15,547
TALIESIN: This sort of thing isn't going to get us
anywhere. Pike.

2432
03:08:15,547 --> 03:08:17,873
Think you can give him back his eye?

2433
03:08:17,873 --> 03:08:22,462
LAURA: Oh, that's a good idea.

2434
03:08:22,462 --> 03:08:26,253
SAM: You're going to use a carrot?

2435
03:08:26,253 --> 03:08:29,128
LIAM: No, that's the stick.

2436
03:08:29,128 --> 03:08:31,155
MARISHA: Do you have Regenerate with you?

2437
03:08:31,155 --> 03:08:32,931
ASHLEY: I do.

2438
03:08:32,931 --> 03:08:35,216
LAURA: Separate him from his god.

2439
03:08:35,216 --> 03:08:37,721
ASHLEY: I put my hand over his eye.

2440
03:08:37,721 --> 03:08:39,925
MATT: He doesn't flinch.

2441
03:08:39,925 --> 03:08:44,250
LAURA: Do it.

2442
03:08:44,250 --> 03:08:47,962
ASHLEY: Are you ready to have your eye back?

2443
03:08:47,962 --> 03:08:50,538
MATT: "I'll just pluck it right back out."

2444
03:08:50,538 --> 03:08:56,650
ASHLEY: Well, you can't. Because you're just going
to stay in these binds forever.

2445
03:08:56,650 --> 03:08:59,693
LIAM: Or Grog will pull your arms off.

2446
03:08:59,693 --> 03:09:01,571
MATT: "Do your worst."

2447
03:09:01,571 --> 03:09:03,490
LAURA: No, he's not scared of pain.

2448
03:09:03,490 --> 03:09:12,662
TRAVIS: Just ask him some questions before the fun
begins. Let's see what he answers with.

2449
03:09:12,662 --> 03:09:15,821
LAURA: Do you know Delilah Briarwood?

2450
03:09:15,821 --> 03:09:29,834
MATT: "Maybe. The fact that you're already here
means that you have no way out, so I fear not.

2451
03:09:29,834 --> 03:09:38,365
"Even if I perish, I die with the comfort of
knowing that you'll perish soon after. That is the

2452
03:09:38,365 --> 03:09:41,438
"comfort in the Whispered One."

2453
03:09:41,438 --> 03:09:43,010
LAURA: Vecna.

2454
03:09:43,010 --> 03:09:50,357
MATT: "So you knowingly came here. You are both
foolish and simple."

2455
03:09:50,357 --> 03:09:52,183
TRAVIS: No, that's just me.

2456
03:09:52,183 --> 03:10:00,600
MATT: "So you said you have questions."

2457
03:10:00,600 --> 03:10:04,981
TRAVIS: What's flying around in the sky?

2458
03:10:04,981 --> 03:10:09,165
MATT: "The sentinels."

2459
03:10:09,165 --> 03:10:11,177
TRAVIS: Sentinels.

2460
03:10:11,177 --> 03:10:21,083
MATT: "That is what they are for us, but they are
known more formally as Gloom Stalkers."

2461
03:10:21,083 --> 03:10:28,662
TRAVIS: Gloom Stalkers. That is a great name.

2462
03:10:28,662 --> 03:10:32,280
MATT: "They are hungry. Ever hungry."

2463
03:10:32,280 --> 03:10:37,025
TRAVIS: They also look fearsome. Do people cower
before them in their presence?

2464
03:10:37,025 --> 03:10:38,443
MATT: "You will."

2465
03:10:38,443 --> 03:10:41,672
TRAVIS: I'll bet. I am easily startled.

2466
03:10:41,672 --> 03:10:45,574
TALIESIN: Where are you from?

2467
03:10:45,574 --> 03:10:49,534
MATT: "It does not matter. The past means nothing
when you give up your secrets."

2468
03:10:49,534 --> 03:11:01,380
TALIESIN: The ziggurats, there's three of them.
You've come through the Wildemount one?

2469
03:11:01,380 --> 03:11:08,044
MATT: He shakes his head. "You will get no
information from me."

2470
03:11:08,044 --> 03:11:16,274
SAM: All right. Can I have a try? You've got one
eye, right? Ugh.

2471
03:11:16,274 --> 03:11:23,960
MATT: You see the gaping socket, and as he goes to
blink one eye, you can see the marking on the

2472
03:11:23,960 --> 03:11:29,066
inside, it looks like it was burned out, so you
watch the outer edge of the flesh and muscle

2473
03:11:29,066 --> 03:11:30,630
twitch whenever he blinks.

2474
03:11:30,630 --> 03:11:39,147
SAM: Gross ocular muscles. I just want to make you
feel good, man, so I'll just sing to you. I'll

2475
03:11:39,147 --> 03:11:47,548
hold up my cone, and I'll sing, (singing) Just the
two of us. You can't quit me if you tried. Just

2476
03:11:47,548 --> 03:11:54,102
the two of us. Me and your eye. So I'll Dominate
Person.

2477
03:11:54,102 --> 03:11:57,462
TRAVIS: He's back.

2478
03:11:57,462 --> 03:12:08,316
MATT: That is... That's an 11. All right. His grin
glazes over and he goes...

2479
03:12:08,316 --> 03:12:16,871
SAM: Will you please tell us everything you know
when we ask you?

2480
03:12:16,871 --> 03:12:18,308
MATT: "But of course."

2481
03:12:18,308 --> 03:12:23,658
SAM: Where are you from?

2482
03:12:23,658 --> 03:12:34,993
MATT: "I am from the outskirts of a far eastern
Wildemount village named Zuvan. It was built on the

2483
03:12:34,993 --> 03:12:41,364
"ruins of Orthanus. I was a poor man, but I found
purpose."

2484
03:12:41,364 --> 03:12:49,852
SAM: Did you come through a ziggurat in Wildemount?
And if so, where?

2485
03:12:49,852 --> 03:12:55,892
MATT: "I don't know. I was taken with many others
who had given themselves to the secrets of the

2486
03:12:55,892 --> 03:13:04,199
"Undying King. I awoke here, mauled but living, and
was inducted, and that was when he took my eye."

2487
03:13:04,199 --> 03:13:05,654
SAM: He?

2488
03:13:05,654 --> 03:13:07,537
MATT: "He. One of the acolytes."

2489
03:13:07,537 --> 03:13:13,857
SAM: The flying things. Well, we know what they
are now.

2490
03:13:13,857 --> 03:13:15,970
TRAVIS: What do they do?

2491
03:13:15,970 --> 03:13:17,850
SAM: Do the flying things have magical powers?

2492
03:13:17,850 --> 03:13:25,354
MATT: "I do not know. They shriek, they eat, they
watch. I do not mess with such terrible and

2493
03:13:25,354 --> 03:13:26,967
"wonderful instruments."

2494
03:13:26,967 --> 03:13:29,096
ASHLEY: How does he get through all the dead?

2495
03:13:29,096 --> 03:13:34,335
SAM: The smoke-making thing that you were
carrying. What is it and how does it work?

2496
03:13:34,335 --> 03:13:41,497
MATT: "It protects those of us who are not as
esteemed in the arts of necromancy to not be

2497
03:13:41,497 --> 03:13:47,168
"bothered by the roving, long-dead soldiers of the
last war on Thar Amphala."

2498
03:13:47,168 --> 03:13:49,705
SAM: The last war on Thar Amphala! What does that
mean?

2499
03:13:49,705 --> 03:13:50,951
LAURA: I don't know!

2500
03:13:50,951 --> 03:13:52,389
SAM: What does that mean?

2501
03:13:52,389 --> 03:13:54,220
MARISHA: The last war on what?

2502
03:13:54,220 --> 03:14:04,313
MATT: Thar Amphala. Thar Amphala, the city built
for the Whispered One, long ago.

2503
03:14:04,313 --> 03:14:06,168
SAM: Oh, that's where we are.

2504
03:14:06,168 --> 03:14:12,423
LAURA: Who lives in the tower, Vecna? Is that
where he is?

2505
03:14:12,423 --> 03:14:15,460
MATT: He just looks at you strangely.

2506
03:14:15,460 --> 03:14:17,545
LIAM: It's got to come from him.

2507
03:14:17,545 --> 03:14:19,215
LAURA: I'm a really good friend of his.

2508
03:14:19,215 --> 03:14:23,134
SAM: She really is, that's being rude. But who
lives in the tower?

2509
03:14:23,134 --> 03:14:27,255
Is it Vecna or Mistress Delilah?

2510
03:14:27,255 --> 03:14:35,242
MATT: "It's where his essence has slowly reclaimed
the space. He will live soon."

2511
03:14:35,242 --> 03:14:37,195
LAURA: Oh, but he's not back yet!

2512
03:14:37,195 --> 03:14:40,547
SAM: The Mistress Delilah. Where is she right
now?

2513
03:14:40,547 --> 03:14:49,738
MATT: "I have not seen her, but if she is not out,
then perhaps the ritual is soon. She is probably

2514
03:14:49,738 --> 03:14:53,453
"at the top of Entropis."

2515
03:14:53,453 --> 03:14:55,759
SAM: Entropis is the tower?

2516
03:14:55,759 --> 03:14:56,878
MATT: "Yes."

2517
03:14:56,878 --> 03:14:58,058
MARISHA: That tower?

2518
03:14:58,058 --> 03:15:01,761
SAM: The only tower.

2519
03:15:01,761 --> 03:15:07,850
TRAVIS: What other alarms are there in the city
that would detect outsiders?

2520
03:15:07,850 --> 03:15:10,555
SAM: What protections do you have on the tower?

2521
03:15:10,555 --> 03:15:17,495
MATT: "I do not know the specifics. I am but a
watcher on the outside of Thar Amphala."

2522
03:15:17,495 --> 03:15:18,995
SAM: You don't go in?

2523
03:15:18,995 --> 03:15:21,694
MATT: "I have not gone in since I gave my eye."

2524
03:15:21,694 --> 03:15:28,032
SAM: And what are your people called? Your group,
your cult?

2525
03:15:28,032 --> 03:15:29,781
MATT: "We are the Remnants."

2526
03:15:29,781 --> 03:15:31,401
ASHLEY: What's his purpose?

2527
03:15:31,401 --> 03:15:33,458
SAM: What's your job with the Remnants?

2528
03:15:33,458 --> 03:15:42,143
MATT: "I am to watch the outskirts of the city. I
am to escort those who would bring various things

2529
03:15:42,143 --> 03:15:44,137
"in preparation for the ritual."

2530
03:15:44,137 --> 03:15:46,550
LAURA: What ritual? What is the ritual going to
do?

2531
03:15:46,550 --> 03:15:48,523
SAM: What will the ritual do?

2532
03:15:48,523 --> 03:16:00,143
MATT: "The ritual is to restore him. To bring him,
so that he can complete the main purpose. The

2533
03:16:00,143 --> 03:16:02,200
"ritual of seeding."

2534
03:16:02,200 --> 03:16:05,645
SAM: He's just a farmer, guys.

2535
03:16:05,645 --> 03:16:13,094
LIAM: How does Delilah factor into it? What does
she get out of it? What does she do?

2536
03:16:13,094 --> 03:16:15,062
SAM: I don't think he knows all of the
intricacies.

2537
03:16:15,062 --> 03:16:17,249
LIAM: I know, but he's probably promised them all
something.

2538
03:16:17,249 --> 03:16:21,454
SAM: What has Delilah promised you? What do you
gain out of this?

2539
03:16:21,454 --> 03:16:33,044
MATT: "When he, the Undying King, returns to this
world, and we bring what we have gained, what we

2540
03:16:33,044 --> 03:16:40,329
"have brought from the other plane, that seed will
be taken to the ritual of the space."

2541
03:16:40,329 --> 03:16:41,786
LAURA: What have they brought?

2542
03:16:41,786 --> 03:16:45,472
SAM: Did you bring something through the portal?
What was it?

2543
03:16:45,472 --> 03:16:58,660
MATT: "I do not understand the details, but for
many months now, these siphons, they have been

2544
03:16:58,660 --> 03:17:07,088
"building the seed. They have been preparing for
his return. And from there, he will complete what

2545
03:17:07,088 --> 03:17:09,057
"he started so long ago."

2546
03:17:09,057 --> 03:17:10,909
LAURA: And that shit's happening soon?

2547
03:17:10,909 --> 03:17:12,877
SAM: When does the ritual begin?

2548
03:17:12,877 --> 03:17:16,676
MATT: "Soon. Things accelerate."

2549
03:17:16,676 --> 03:17:22,780
SAM: I know we look different now, but if you had
to pick one of us, which is the most handsome?

2550
03:17:22,780 --> 03:17:25,486
MATT: "That would be you, my friend."

2551
03:17:25,486 --> 03:17:26,887
SAM: I thought so.

2552
03:17:26,887 --> 03:17:29,118
TRAVIS: Can he take us safely to the tower?

2553
03:17:29,118 --> 03:17:33,727
SAM: Can you escort us to the tower? Dominate
Person has got to be wearing off.

2554
03:17:33,727 --> 03:17:36,165
MATT: I'm checking the spell just to be sure.

2555
03:17:36,165 --> 03:17:38,543
LAURA: We have a thing. We can at least get
through town.

2556
03:17:38,543 --> 03:17:41,569
SAM: One minute. It's probably over.

2557
03:17:41,569 --> 03:17:49,120
MATT: Yeah. So by about now, after these questions
have come through, his one eye blinks, and he

2558
03:17:49,120 --> 03:17:58,581
goes, (grunt), "It matters not. He already knows
you're here."

2559
03:17:58,581 --> 03:18:00,298
LIAM: I punch him in the temple again.

2560
03:18:00,298 --> 03:18:04,470
LAURA: He likes it. Stop giving him pleasure.

2561
03:18:04,470 --> 03:18:06,652
TRAVIS: I poke him in his remaining eyeball.

2562
03:18:06,652 --> 03:18:10,887
MATT: Do you? Roll a strength check.

2563
03:18:10,887 --> 03:18:14,030
LIAM: A strength check? For some Jello?

2564
03:18:14,030 --> 03:18:16,147
TRAVIS: Oh God. 25.

2565
03:18:16,147 --> 03:18:19,211
MATT: (shriek of pain)

2566
03:18:19,211 --> 03:18:21,484
TALIESIN: I close the mouth.

2567
03:18:21,484 --> 03:18:27,220
MATT: There is a smear of crimson down his face as
the other eye has just been turned to paste.

2568
03:18:27,220 --> 03:18:29,248
LAURA: Wow, we're terrible people.

2569
03:18:29,248 --> 03:18:33,228
TRAVIS: Oh, what was that? It matters not? Oh, are
you going to be rewarded? Yeah. How many middle

2570
03:18:33,228 --> 03:18:35,041
fingers am I holding up?

2571
03:18:35,041 --> 03:18:37,315
LAURA: We should put him out of his misery.

2572
03:18:37,315 --> 03:18:38,849
TRAVIS: Why? I like misery.

2573
03:18:38,849 --> 03:18:44,088
SAM: Well, if we just release him into the city
without his censer...

2574
03:18:44,088 --> 03:18:47,574
LIAM: He's going to stumble out like a maniac.
Squish the bug, Grog.

2575
03:18:47,574 --> 03:18:55,245
SAM: No, no. If we send him away from us, maybe
one of those things will find him and we'll have a

2576
03:18:55,245 --> 03:18:56,624
clearer path.

2577
03:18:56,624 --> 03:18:58,947
TRAVIS: He's yelling. He'll make all sorts of
sound.

2578
03:18:58,947 --> 03:19:04,037
SAM: Yeah, if we send him away from us and then we
go the other way. He's a human distraction!

2579
03:19:04,037 --> 03:19:07,338
TALIESIN: We don't need a distraction, we need
quiet at this point.

2580
03:19:07,338 --> 03:19:10,993
LIAM: And those things, we don't know if they
could alert back if they saw something fishy like that.

2581
03:19:10,993 --> 03:19:19,236
TALIESIN: I'll release him and you do your
business, all right? Manners.

2582
03:19:19,236 --> 03:19:23,252
MATT: (mechanical clicking) It all unfolds and
returns into the sphere.

2583
03:19:23,252 --> 03:19:24,571
TRAVIS: Great word.

2584
03:19:24,571 --> 03:19:26,975
TALIESIN: Thank you. It's programmable.

2585
03:19:26,975 --> 03:19:32,795
TRAVIS: Should we let you back out so you can find
your way back?

2586
03:19:32,795 --> 03:19:37,511
MATT: "Do your worst."

2587
03:19:37,511 --> 03:19:39,284
TRAVIS: (crack)

2588
03:19:39,284 --> 03:19:44,739
MATT: With a sickening snap, you can hear as the
spinal column is severed at the base of the neck,

2589
03:19:44,739 --> 03:19:47,623
and he goes limp in Grog's grasp.

2590
03:19:47,623 --> 03:19:52,612
ASHLEY: Grab his necklace in case we need another
one for some reason.

2591
03:19:52,612 --> 03:19:54,627
LAURA: Should we grab any cloaks?

2592
03:19:54,627 --> 03:19:58,555
TALIESIN: Grab the necklaces and the cloaks and
the censer. All three of them.

2593
03:19:58,555 --> 03:20:03,187
MATT: Actually, he has almost nothing on him but
the censer.

2594
03:20:03,187 --> 03:20:05,119
MARISHA: No necklace?

2595
03:20:05,119 --> 03:20:10,027
MATT: He has-- Actually, no, he would not have one
of the necklaces. Because he does not...

2596
03:20:10,027 --> 03:20:11,435
MARISHA: Travel through?

2597
03:20:11,435 --> 03:20:15,874
MATT: He has a symbol, a similar symbol, but it's
much smaller, more just a basic holy symbol of

2598
03:20:15,874 --> 03:20:21,524
some kind. Same shape, but it doesn't have the
same thick iron presentation as the ones that you

2599
03:20:21,524 --> 03:20:22,707
guys encountered.

2600
03:20:22,707 --> 03:20:29,634
LAURA: I have a holy symbol to Vecna that we took
off of somebody in the original ziggurat.

2601
03:20:29,634 --> 03:20:31,662
MATT: Yes, and that is the same symbol.

2602
03:20:31,662 --> 03:20:32,965
LAURA: It is, okay.

2603
03:20:32,965 --> 03:20:37,623
LIAM: We're in an ancient city. Are there the
remains of furniture in here?

2604
03:20:37,623 --> 03:20:42,329
LAURA: I just want to take a nap or a cozy
sit-down.

2605
03:20:42,329 --> 03:20:44,670
LIAM: No, I want to shove him in a closet or wrap
him up in something.

2606
03:20:44,670 --> 03:20:46,851
TRAVIS: I'm putting him in the Bag of Holding as
you're talking.

2607
03:20:46,851 --> 03:20:53,031
TALIESIN: We can't keep everything.

2608
03:20:53,031 --> 03:20:56,902
LIAM: Does anybody see any-- Never mind.

2609
03:20:56,902 --> 03:21:01,237
TALIESIN: Is there anything of interest in this
building, since we have a moment?

2610
03:21:01,237 --> 03:21:02,895
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2611
03:21:02,895 --> 03:21:07,354
LIAM: I'm going to investigate, too, because I was
looking for furniture.

2612
03:21:07,354 --> 03:21:08,695
TALIESIN: 15.

2613
03:21:08,695 --> 03:21:15,741
LIAM: And I have advantage, hold on.
Investigation... 22.

2614
03:21:15,741 --> 03:21:22,998
MATT: Okay. You do find some furniture. Most of
it's very basic, tables, maybe a couple chairs, a

2615
03:21:22,998 --> 03:21:31,631
couple of cots that are mainly wood boards with a
thin cushion on it. The existence here was not to

2616
03:21:31,631 --> 03:21:36,674
be-- It's a very plain city of worship. You can
see everything was built here to gather

2617
03:21:36,674 --> 03:21:43,056
worshipers, to gather the Remnants, or whatever
they were called before, the last time that Vecna

2618
03:21:43,056 --> 03:21:45,440
fell and the city was assaulted.

2619
03:21:45,440 --> 03:21:49,623
LIAM: Right, so this is all worse than Fallout
Three at this point.

2620
03:21:49,623 --> 03:21:50,924
MATT: It's on par with.

2621
03:21:50,924 --> 03:21:55,863
LIAM: PlayStation Three graphics.

2622
03:21:55,863 --> 03:22:01,800
TALIESIN: I say we make our way towards the
spire.

2623
03:22:01,800 --> 03:22:12,464
MATT: So now, still under the guise of various
undead, holding a wandering burning censer

2624
03:22:12,464 --> 03:22:23,679
procured from the now-dead, eye-popped corpse of a
wandering cultist, you slowly make your way deeper

2625
03:22:23,679 --> 03:22:29,705
into the city of Thar Amphala, towards the tower
of Entropis, where seemingly the cult of the

2626
03:22:29,705 --> 03:22:36,251
Remnant are attempting to bring Vecna back to
physical form for an even greater ritual

2627
03:22:36,251 --> 03:22:43,627
thereafter. And that's where we'll finish
tonight's episode. We'll return next week to pick

2628
03:22:43,627 --> 03:22:45,193
up from there, guys.

2629
03:22:45,193 --> 03:22:47,713
LAURA: This is amazing!

2630
03:22:47,713 --> 03:22:50,471
TRAVIS: This is the best setup ever!

2631
03:22:50,471 --> 03:22:59,962
MATT: So happy. I know! I get to touch people's
hands!

2632
03:22:59,962 --> 03:23:01,306
LIAM: Dorks!

2633
03:23:01,306 --> 03:23:10,094
MATT: I know, we're such huge nerds. This feels so
much like the home game, it makes me happy.

2634
03:23:10,094 --> 03:23:11,974
LIAM: Serious deja vu.

2635
03:23:11,974 --> 03:23:13,958
TALIESIN: All it needs is honey and brie.

2636
03:23:13,958 --> 03:23:17,776
LAURA: We could put food out in front of us!

2637
03:23:17,776 --> 03:23:25,022
MATT: Next week, pajamas and mimosas. What better
way to celebrate a Vecna arc in the Shadowfell?

2638
03:23:25,022 --> 03:23:27,232
LIAM: Bring your dog to work day!

2639
03:23:27,232 --> 03:23:31,347
TALIESIN: PJ's, mimosas, and very old puppies?

2640
03:23:31,347 --> 03:23:34,168
LIAM: And Charlie? Can Charlie come?

2641
03:23:34,168 --> 03:23:35,846
LAURA: I think it's necessary.

2642
03:23:35,846 --> 03:23:39,556
TALIESIN: Charlie can run Trinket.

2643
03:23:39,556 --> 03:23:46,093
MATT: So guys, thank you so much. We're back next
week. I want to give another big thank you to the

2644
03:23:46,093 --> 03:23:50,647
amazing crew and people here at Legendary/Geek and
Sundry that have been working almost around the

2645
03:23:50,647 --> 03:23:55,918
clock to make this set work, to make this table
work, to make the equipment work, the lighting,

2646
03:23:55,918 --> 03:24:00,889
the audio. We've taken all of your suggestions,
we've reached out to the community, to try and make

2647
03:24:00,889 --> 03:24:06,909
this as best and as comfortable as possible for us
and you guys. I know it's a work in progress, and

2648
03:24:06,909 --> 03:24:09,895
you'll watch things improve as we go, as we learn
and figure things out, so thank you for your

2649
03:24:09,895 --> 03:24:14,345
patience. But seriously, if you get the
opportunity, show some appreciation for the people

2650
03:24:14,345 --> 03:24:18,149
who've been working really hard to try and improve
this experience for everyone involved. Thank you

2651
03:24:18,200 --> 03:24:19,789
guys, you're all so amazing.

2652
03:24:19,789 --> 03:24:23,396
(cheers)

2653
03:24:23,396 --> 03:24:32,348
