1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,267
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome back to Critical
Role! We've had a two-week hiatus due to illness

2
00:00:07,267 --> 00:00:13,149
and traveling, but we're back, and we're a little
late today because of traffic in Los Angeles, which is

3
00:00:13,242 --> 00:00:15,114
always a pleasurable experience.

4
00:00:15,114 --> 00:00:18,347
LAURA: This is what happens when you get half the
cast in a session together.

5
00:00:18,403 --> 00:00:19,965
MARISHA: In Santa Monica.

6
00:00:19,965 --> 00:00:26,068
MATT: It was good times! We love you, Steve! You
did great! But no, so, we're happy to be here, we

7
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:30,585
missed you guys, we missed each other, and the
rest of our team just arrived as well.

8
00:00:30,585 --> 00:00:31,908
MARY: Sam!

9
00:00:31,908 --> 00:00:36,230
MATT: We've got a Sam, and we've got a Liam coming
in right now. So, let's go ahead and knock these

10
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:40,663
announcements out so we can get this game started.
So, first and foremost, I want to let you guys

11
00:00:40,663 --> 00:00:47,442
know that Tor Books has been nice enough to help
sponsor tonight's episode of content, so you guys

12
00:00:47,442 --> 00:00:52,946
have seen announcements and stuff for their new
book, Bands of Mourning, which we had at the last

13
00:00:52,946 --> 00:00:55,776
game, you being a Brandon Sanderson fan for a long
time.

14
00:00:55,776 --> 00:01:00,537
WILL: Huge Brandon Sanderson Fan. We've talked
about this. Yeah, we've talked about this.

15
00:01:00,537 --> 00:01:05,652
MATT: So it's good, good stuff. I've been
perpetually prodded about whether or not that's me

16
00:01:05,652 --> 00:01:09,823
on the cover. It's not, but if they ever option it
for a film it is.

17
00:01:09,823 --> 00:01:14,340
WILL: Oh, you'd be a good Wax! You'd be a
good Waxilum. He was the lead character.

18
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,782
MATT: Well, see, there we go. Read the books, then
write a screenplay, then get it optioned, and then

19
00:01:18,782 --> 00:01:19,748
cast me.

20
00:01:19,748 --> 00:01:21,439
WILL: Easy, it's Hollywood!

21
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,939
MARY: How hard could that be?

22
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:28,448
MATT: Yeah, so, Bands of Mourning. Thank you, Tor,
for taking an interest in our little show, and I hope

23
00:01:28,448 --> 00:01:36,149
you guys take an interest in their awesome books.
So, have fun! Next up, announcements, me and

24
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:40,386
Marisha want to give a big shoutout and thanks to
Kaizoku Con in Ireland. We had a wonderful time

25
00:01:40,386 --> 00:01:43,211
meeting a bunch of you Critters over there on the
green isle.

26
00:01:43,211 --> 00:01:45,448
SAM: Are there Critters in Ireland?

27
00:01:45,448 --> 00:01:48,690
MATT: Dude! They were out in force! It was
amazing!

28
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:55,749
MARISHA: Yes, and there were a bunch of people who
came over from England, as well. We had a couple

29
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:57,068
people from Egypt.

30
00:01:57,068 --> 00:01:58,384
SAM: Egypt?

31
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:01,425
MATT: It was really, really cool. So thank you
guys for all coming out and visiting us.

32
00:02:01,425 --> 00:02:04,073
MARISHA: This episode is also sponsored by
Jameson.

33
00:02:04,073 --> 00:02:06,509
MATT: (laughs) Because we got a lot of it when we
were there.

34
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:07,999
MARISHA: Thanks, Ireland!

35
00:02:07,999 --> 00:02:19,067
MATT: Let's see, next up, I want to give a thanks
to Syrinscape again. I'm going to be incorporating

36
00:02:19,067 --> 00:02:25,268
Syrinscape's audio programming into sessions in
the near future once we get everything ironed out

37
00:02:25,268 --> 00:02:29,653
from my list setup, but they're an awesome program
you should check out to help you run audio for

38
00:02:29,653 --> 00:02:34,402
your tabletop gaming experiences. It has built-in
soundboards and music tracks. It's really, really

39
00:02:34,402 --> 00:02:42,291
cool, so I recommend you check them out. Also, I
want to give a big thank-you to Dwarven Forge. We

40
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:46,861
had a Critter in the past send me a bunch of
dungeon tiles, and I myself had backed previous

41
00:02:46,861 --> 00:02:53,044
Kickstarters of theirs, and just recently got all
my city builder stuff, and have more that they

42
00:02:53,044 --> 00:02:59,351
sent me that may be showing up on the stream in
the near future, to help make battle maps and

43
00:02:59,351 --> 00:03:03,180
things look a lot cooler and more three
dimensional, so I'm excited about that. They also

44
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,670
have a really amazing Kickstarter that just went
up last week called the castle builder, where now

45
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:12,213
Dwarven Forge allows you modular pieces where you
can build and customize your own castle pieces for

46
00:03:12,213 --> 00:03:18,059
your game at home, and it looks ridiculous! So, if
that's something that interests you for your home

47
00:03:18,059 --> 00:03:23,191
games, go check out Dwarven Forge's Kickstarter
for the castle builder. Looks pretty fricking rad.

48
00:03:23,191 --> 00:03:26,990
I've already given them way too much money for it.

49
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:33,111
Also, for those of you who have tried out the
Order of the Lycan for my Blood Hunter build, I

50
00:03:33,111 --> 00:03:37,934
did an update last night. Minor tweaks. Basically,
just clarifying some of the rules for dex builds,

51
00:03:37,934 --> 00:03:44,322
as well as some minor balance adjustments, but go
check it out! Beyond that, all the feedback's been

52
00:03:44,322 --> 00:03:52,342
really positive. I don't foresee any major tweaks
in the near future, so that's good. Marisha, you

53
00:03:52,342 --> 00:03:55,209
wanted to pitch your new show that's coming out
here?

54
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:58,415
MARISHA: Yes, I have a new show coming out on Geek
and Sundry.

55
00:03:58,415 --> 00:03:59,778
SAM: Whoa, is that true?

56
00:03:59,778 --> 00:04:01,156
MARISHA: That is true.

57
00:04:01,156 --> 00:04:02,367
SAM: What's it called?

58
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,740
ALL: Eeey!

59
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:09,499
WILL: Everyone's doing Fonzie!

60
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:16,721
SAM: What is it? What happens on the show?

61
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:21,706
MARISHA: Anyway, it's called Signal Boost, and
there's actually going to be a never-before-seen

62
00:04:21,706 --> 00:04:29,100
promo airing during the intermission, but yeah,
I'm hosting the first run, and I'm producing it,

63
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:35,671
and Sean Becker is directing it, and it's written
by Eric Campbell, so it should be very fun.

64
00:04:35,671 --> 00:04:37,714
TRAVIS: Do you boost signals in it?

65
00:04:37,714 --> 00:04:38,822
MARISHA: I do boost lots of signals.

66
00:04:38,822 --> 00:04:41,743
SAM: Is it just about optimizing your home Wi-Fi
network?

67
00:04:41,743 --> 00:04:49,814
MARISHA: A hundred percent. It's sponsored by Time
Warner Cable. It's great. Yeah. Check it, no it's

68
00:04:49,814 --> 00:04:51,354
not, that would be awful.

69
00:04:51,354 --> 00:04:54,861
WILL: It's going to be on from two to six? Or six
to eight, or whenever they want to show up?

70
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:59,588
MARISHA: Well, six to six, got to be there. May
get service.

71
00:04:59,588 --> 00:05:04,202
MATT: Perfect. We'll have that video at the break
today. Let's see.

72
00:05:04,202 --> 00:05:08,611
MARISHA: Oh, and it's airing Tuesday, by the way.
It's airing on Tuesday. On geekandsundry.com.

73
00:05:08,611 --> 00:05:13,184
MATT: Huzzah. Laura, you have something you just
got a chance to talk about recently.

74
00:05:13,184 --> 00:05:18,800
LAURA: Oh man, yeah! On Tuesday, I think it was
Tuesday, we finally got to admit, I got to

75
00:05:18,876 --> 00:05:20,808
say that I was in Gears of War 4.

76
00:05:20,808 --> 00:05:22,936
(cheering)

77
00:05:22,936 --> 00:05:24,308
LAURA: So that's pretty exciting.

78
00:05:24,308 --> 00:05:26,662
MARISHA: Because no one had any clue--

79
00:05:26,662 --> 00:05:29,660
LAURA: Any idea. I know, I'd already had a bunch
of messages on Twitter, but I couldn't confirm

80
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,020
them until the 8th, and I finally can.

81
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,689
TRAVIS and LAURA: Yay NDAs.

82
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:41,553
LAURA: But in conjunction with that, Liam
McIntyre, who is one of-- he also leads in the

83
00:05:41,553 --> 00:05:43,096
game--

84
00:05:43,096 --> 00:05:44,130
LIAM: That's confusing.

85
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:48,798
LAURA: I know, right? I already like him because
his name is Liam, but, and I also like him because

86
00:05:48,798 --> 00:05:54,818
he's a nerd. And I say this because he just
started a Kickstarter for a card game that he

87
00:05:54,818 --> 00:05:58,899
developed called Monster Lab, so if you guys want
to check it out, it's really really cute, it's

88
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:01,974
really really fun, I think it's been going for
like 15 days. They're doing really well on the

89
00:06:01,974 --> 00:06:04,073
Kickstarter but now they're going for stretch
goals, so.

90
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:05,112
MARISHA: Nice!

91
00:06:05,112 --> 00:06:07,330
LAURA: Monster Lab.

92
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:12,868
MATT: Monster Lab on Kickstarter. Ah yes. Taliesin,
you had something you wanted to go through?

93
00:06:12,868 --> 00:06:18,823
TALIESIN: Yes, no, as I realized as I came out of
the haze of Portland, I'm the new voice of Crazy

94
00:06:18,823 --> 00:06:21,517
Dave in Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare.

95
00:06:21,517 --> 00:06:23,336
(cheering)

96
00:06:23,336 --> 00:06:25,045
TALIESIN: Apparently, and it's a lot of fun.

97
00:06:25,045 --> 00:06:26,086
SAM: You're perfect for that.

98
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:27,910
TALIESIN: Thank you. (incoherent grumbling)

99
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:31,010
MARISHA: So much fun. You should wear a pot on
your head all the time.

100
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,900
TALIESIN: You really don't like the hair, do you?

101
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,900
MARISHA: It's awesome!

102
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,652
MARY: It's a light-- it's a color absorber, it's
really cool.

103
00:06:38,652 --> 00:06:40,720
TALIESIN: I went fishing for that one, that was
nice.

104
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,913
MARY: Can I just thank everybody from CoastCon
real quick? You guys treated Steve and I so well

105
00:06:45,913 --> 00:06:50,691
in Biloxi, we had such an amazing time, and I met
some unbelievable Critters there. This one

106
00:06:50,691 --> 00:06:57,644
fantastic woman who started becoming now a DM
because of Critical Role and it's just amazing.

107
00:06:57,644 --> 00:06:59,341
Oh, and I got these really cool horns.

108
00:06:59,341 --> 00:07:00,481
LAURA: They're so cute!

109
00:07:00,481 --> 00:07:06,529
MARY: And my ring of flask. My one ring. Thank you
to everybody.

110
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:08,637
TALIESIN: One scotch to bind them all together.

111
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:13,893
MARY: It's apple juice! They gave me the flask,
not what's in it.

112
00:07:13,893 --> 00:07:17,617
MATT: And Liam, you said you wanted to--?

113
00:07:17,617 --> 00:07:21,230
LIAM: Hey, Marvel Animated has started to use me
as Doctor Strange, so.

114
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,627
(cheering)

115
00:07:23,627 --> 00:07:25,215
MARISHA: And it's so good!

116
00:07:25,215 --> 00:07:30,476
LIAM: And also, if you need to put your dice in
something, you should go to wyrmwoodgaming.com and

117
00:07:30,476 --> 00:07:34,659
use the code 'critrole,' which will get you free
shipping.

118
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:36,920
MARY: You put your dice in the thing.

119
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,540
LAURA: Hey, look at this beautiful box.

120
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:42,022
LIAM: They're beautiful. Many of you have been
purchasing them. They're lovely to make nice

121
00:07:42,022 --> 00:07:44,537
presents for yourself or for another person.

122
00:07:44,537 --> 00:07:48,018
MATT: This is what happens when we're gone for two
weeks, we have to cram all of our backup, like,

123
00:07:48,018 --> 00:07:52,002
catchup announcements and little friend-bumps
there at the front.

124
00:07:52,002 --> 00:07:57,451
LIAM: Let's hear it also for the app called Waze,
which got me here at 7:20 instead of 7:45.

125
00:07:57,451 --> 00:08:02,240
LAURA: No. No. Well, that's true, but we used it
right away and we got here 20 minutes earlier than

126
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,033
him.

127
00:08:03,033 --> 00:08:04,653
LIAM: Yeah. Mm-hm. Yeah.

128
00:08:04,653 --> 00:08:07,685
MATT: So Waze, if you're looking to throw some
sponsor dollars around.

129
00:08:07,685 --> 00:08:11,763
MARY: Pull out the Morgan Freeman voice. We love
it.

130
00:08:11,763 --> 00:08:14,878
MATT: (Morgan Freeman voice) You got to make sure
you get to your place on time.

131
00:08:14,878 --> 00:08:17,650
SAM: Matt, can I do one quick shoutout?

132
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:18,757
MATT: Yes, yes!

133
00:08:18,757 --> 00:08:23,300
SAM: My friend Mark Whitten has a DND-based
webseries starting tomorrow called Rolling High, I

134
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,300
think it's youtube/rollinghigh, check it out.

135
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:32,744
MATT: Delightful! Wondrous. Anything else, any
other announcements, anything crazy?

136
00:08:32,744 --> 00:08:37,797
MARISHA: I got a new note-taking pen. Look at
all the colors.

137
00:08:37,797 --> 00:08:39,686
LAURA: Solid announcement.

138
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:43,418
MATT: All right, let's do it, guys, let's step
on.

139
00:08:43,418 --> 00:08:45,900
TRAVIS: This is where we need the light change.

140
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:53,635
MATT: Bring it in. So to catch everyone up what's
going on, Vox Machina, our intrepid band of

141
00:08:53,635 --> 00:09:03,111
adventurers, after dealing with the horrible
attacks by the dragon circle known as the Chroma

142
00:09:03,111 --> 00:09:09,985
Conclave, destroying cities all across Tal'Dorei,
the party escaped, sent the refugees they could,

143
00:09:09,985 --> 00:09:14,895
as well as allies, back to Whitestone, seemingly
not on the radar of this attacking front of

144
00:09:14,895 --> 00:09:20,245
dragons at the moment, and then made their way
toward Vasselheim to find allies, Pike staying

145
00:09:20,245 --> 00:09:26,016
behind to help with the refugees at the moment.
Upon going to Vasselheim, you managed to encounter

146
00:09:26,016 --> 00:09:32,806
a number of old friends from the Slayer's Take and
enlist them for the time being to help you with

147
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:39,498
the refugees and your current wanderings here in
the city proper. At the same time, you encountered

148
00:09:39,498 --> 00:09:47,433
Lady Kima, who also has agreed to help with the
events in Whitestone and this entire dragon attack

149
00:09:47,433 --> 00:09:55,232
towards the east, and you, after wandering the
city for a bit, retrieving these allies, followed

150
00:09:55,232 --> 00:10:00,117
Grog into the Trial Forge, where you had a
conversation with Earthbreaker Groon. And by

151
00:10:00,117 --> 00:10:06,834
conversation I mean a full-on drag-out sandpit
battle to prove your worth to him, in which case

152
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:11,651
you were given information about these things
called the Vestiges of the Divergence, artifacts

153
00:10:11,651 --> 00:10:16,706
of great legendary power that existed from
previous wars that had wiped out most of society

154
00:10:16,706 --> 00:10:23,063
multiple times. These Vestiges have been scattered
around the world, many of them lost to the history

155
00:10:23,063 --> 00:10:31,409
books or passed down as symbols of power through
various bloodlines or government positions, or

156
00:10:31,409 --> 00:10:36,115
stolen and haven't been seen for hundreds of
years. You've found the location of two of them,

157
00:10:36,115 --> 00:10:46,396
one of which was the Titanstone Knuckles, and the
other happened to be some sort of a leather, a

158
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:53,451
Deathwalker's Leather that belonged to a champion
of the Raven Queen. This exists in apparently the

159
00:10:53,451 --> 00:10:59,916
champion's tomb, which used to exist to the west
of Vasselheim until it eventually sunk into the

160
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:05,468
ground as the topography shifted over time and
resides beneath a lake known as the Marrowglade

161
00:11:05,468 --> 00:11:14,208
Loch. So. That is where we left off, as you guys
recovered from the encounter in the Trial Forge,

162
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:21,037
and deciding on your plan going forward. Stepping
from the tavern, having a few drinks, and

163
00:11:21,037 --> 00:11:27,564
discussing the merits of your current path, what
would you like to do, friends?

164
00:11:27,564 --> 00:11:29,323
TRAVIS: That fucking hurt!

165
00:11:29,323 --> 00:11:32,438
(laughter)

166
00:11:32,438 --> 00:11:34,603
TRAVIS: Old dude hit hard.

167
00:11:34,603 --> 00:11:37,505
MARY: Well done, though.

168
00:11:37,505 --> 00:11:41,200
TRAVIS: I mean, we found two of the vestibules
of--

169
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,079
SAM: What did you find again? Brass knuckles of
some sort?

170
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:52,441
TRAVIS: No, no, no. He mentioned, he mentioned
Titanstone Knuckles.

171
00:11:52,441 --> 00:11:55,901
LAURA: Do you know about those?

172
00:11:55,901 --> 00:12:04,456
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. It's a bit of a sensitive
subject. (clears throat) I think my Uncle Kevdak

173
00:12:04,456 --> 00:12:05,844
has 'em.

174
00:12:05,844 --> 00:12:07,915
ALL: What?

175
00:12:07,915 --> 00:12:16,891
TRAVIS: Yeah. The leader of our wandering herd? He
has two prize weapons that he pretty much

176
00:12:16,891 --> 00:12:19,945
used to use to beat me, like, near death.

177
00:12:19,945 --> 00:12:21,492
MARY: Oh.

178
00:12:21,492 --> 00:12:22,835
SAM: And now we have them?

179
00:12:22,835 --> 00:12:24,017
ALL: No.

180
00:12:24,017 --> 00:12:25,855
TRAVIS: No, we, he's still got them.

181
00:12:25,855 --> 00:12:30,252
MARY: So where, do you have any idea where they
might be wandering?

182
00:12:30,252 --> 00:12:36,249
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's this thing, I lost the GPS
tracker on them, so, no.

183
00:12:36,249 --> 00:12:38,313
LAURA: You should use Waze.

184
00:12:38,313 --> 00:12:41,048
(laughter)

185
00:12:41,048 --> 00:12:44,573
MARY: Sometimes it gets there, well, 20 minutes
here or there.

186
00:12:44,573 --> 00:12:54,056
TRAVIS: Yeah, but he's real strong. And it's only
one of two really powerful weapons he has, so hey,

187
00:12:54,056 --> 00:12:56,828
at least we know where one of them is.

188
00:12:56,828 --> 00:13:00,000
MARY: How is your relationship with him now?
Besides the fact that he used to beat the crap out

189
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,256
of you when you were younger.

190
00:13:01,256 --> 00:13:02,565
TRAVIS: Just peachy. Like.

191
00:13:02,565 --> 00:13:03,411
MARY: Really?

192
00:13:03,411 --> 00:13:05,260
TRAVIS: Really great, no, it's fucking terrible.

193
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,564
MARY: Oh. That's lovely.

194
00:13:06,564 --> 00:13:07,842
TRAVIS: Yeah.

195
00:13:07,842 --> 00:13:12,356
MARISHA: All right, well, we know where one is.
Where are these leathers, then? From the Raven

196
00:13:12,356 --> 00:13:15,077
Queen, we need to figure out where the Marrowglade
Loch is?

197
00:13:15,077 --> 00:13:16,542
MARY: The Marrowglade Loch.

198
00:13:16,542 --> 00:13:17,659
MARISHA: Do we know where that is?

199
00:13:17,659 --> 00:13:18,973
LAURA: It's a lake.

200
00:13:18,973 --> 00:13:23,491
MARY: I did get a map from the Slayer's Take, is
there anything on this map that would indicate

201
00:13:23,491 --> 00:13:24,564
where the Loch is?

202
00:13:24,564 --> 00:13:33,272
MATT: Yeah, the Marrowglade Loch resides about a
seven- to eight-hour journey swift of foot to the

203
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:40,864
west-southwest area of Vasselheim. And it is
marked on the map, it's not marked as a major

204
00:13:40,864 --> 00:13:51,173
place, it's just this sunken, somewhat muddy,
swampish land. You've passed--

205
00:13:51,173 --> 00:13:55,465
MARY: This wasn't the place that we passed on the
way to go get Rimefang, was it? There was--

206
00:13:55,465 --> 00:14:01,246
MATT: No, no no no. That was more north. But you
passed this in your travels and some of your hunts

207
00:14:01,246 --> 00:14:05,234
with the Slayers' Take before, but it's never been
a place of consequence, it is just a lake that

208
00:14:05,234 --> 00:14:08,176
exists on a map until this significance was given
to it.

209
00:14:08,176 --> 00:14:10,113
MARY: So we, so Kash and I have passed it before.

210
00:14:10,113 --> 00:14:12,565
MATT: Yeah, I'd say probably some time in the
past.

211
00:14:12,565 --> 00:14:15,704
LAURA: So we know it's relatively close, we should
probably head there.

212
00:14:15,704 --> 00:14:18,746
WILL: If you think your uncle's closer than eight
hours away--

213
00:14:18,746 --> 00:14:21,276
MARISHA: No, he's on another continent.

214
00:14:21,276 --> 00:14:23,653
WILL: Then he's probably not closer than eight
hours away.

215
00:14:23,653 --> 00:14:26,669
MARY: Or he's in the tavern down the street. You
never know.

216
00:14:26,669 --> 00:14:31,177
LAURA: I feel like we need to, we told--

217
00:14:31,177 --> 00:14:32,431
TRAVIS: What?

218
00:14:32,431 --> 00:14:39,080
LAURA: We keep changing places and nobody's going
to know where we are. Pike is in Whitestone. How

219
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,584
do we let her know we're moving? Or are we coming
back here?

220
00:14:42,584 --> 00:14:47,774
SAM: Wait, where are we going? Marrowway Cove?
What?

221
00:14:47,774 --> 00:14:49,197
MARY and LAURA: To the Loch.

222
00:14:49,197 --> 00:14:51,368
TALIESIN: Well, we're only going for a day.

223
00:14:51,368 --> 00:14:55,004
LIAM: That dragon's days are numbered.

224
00:14:55,004 --> 00:15:00,826
MARISHA: Yeah, I feel like if Pike really needed
to get a hold of us, she could.

225
00:15:00,826 --> 00:15:02,838
TALIESIN: We could also leave word for where we're
going.

226
00:15:02,838 --> 00:15:10,001
LAURA: Let's leave word at the Slayer's Take that
we're heading out. So if, you know, Allura or Pike

227
00:15:10,001 --> 00:15:12,336
shows up wanting to find us--

228
00:15:12,336 --> 00:15:15,185
TALIESIN: Or, god forbid, if something happens to
us, they know where to retrieve our bodies.

229
00:15:15,185 --> 00:15:18,804
WILL: The Take's not coming out to retrieve our
bodies.

230
00:15:18,804 --> 00:15:20,044
MARY: No, they won't.

231
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,139
WILL: The Take's not coming out. There's no money
in your bodies.

232
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:28,360
MATT: And Kima at this point looks about and says,
"Well, if we have plans to head east and probably

233
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:34,174
"not spend much time here among Vasselheim for a
while, I have some business I've got to clear up

234
00:15:34,174 --> 00:15:35,491
"here as well."

235
00:15:35,491 --> 00:15:39,856
MARY: Can I introduce myself, Lady Kima? I don't
think we've ever met before. Have we?

236
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:45,984
MATT: "This is true, actually. No." And she steps
up to you and you, you know, at first view you've

237
00:15:45,984 --> 00:15:56,222
had you see she's square-shouldered and pretty
rough in the physicality of what you'd imagine

238
00:15:56,222 --> 00:16:00,859
from most halflings you see. She walks with her
shoulders forward and she has this intensity to

239
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:09,512
her step, even when it's just a friendly exchange.
She bears armor that is gold with various silver

240
00:16:09,512 --> 00:16:16,997
and blue details on it that are parts of the
presentation of Bahamut and the temple that is a

241
00:16:16,997 --> 00:16:22,848
representation of his worship. She carries a
large, metallic hammer that she keeps left over

242
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:32,742
one shoulder. She has just-past-her-shoulders wavy
ashy, dirty-blondish hair and a big scar that

243
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:38,427
rides across her face as well as a number of other
scars that aren't quite as visible. She grins as

244
00:16:38,427 --> 00:16:42,525
she steps up and moves her hammer to the other
side of her shoulders with a clink and puts her

245
00:16:42,525 --> 00:16:43,749
hand out.

246
00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:48,289
MARY: I put mine out as well and say: your
appearance fascinates me on so many levels, I look

247
00:16:48,289 --> 00:16:50,175
forward to getting to know you.

248
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:53,551
MATT: She pulls her hand away and she goes,
"Interesting coming from you, definitely."

249
00:16:53,551 --> 00:16:54,808
MARY: Yeah.

250
00:16:54,808 --> 00:16:56,298
MATT: "All right."

251
00:16:56,298 --> 00:16:58,983
WILL: I don't think we met either, how you doing?

252
00:16:58,983 --> 00:17:00,901
MATT: "Anyway."

253
00:17:00,901 --> 00:17:05,015
MARY: That's Kash. A man of few words.

254
00:17:05,015 --> 00:17:09,689
MATT: "I've met few as unremarkable as you in my
travels."

255
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:11,579
WILL: I'm sorry, I wasn't listening, what?

256
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:19,348
MATT: "Touché. Well, I'll get about my business
here, you said you're traveling for half a day to

257
00:17:19,348 --> 00:17:26,758
"a day, say meet back at the Slayer's Take in about
24, 36 hours, then head on to the east?"

258
00:17:26,758 --> 00:17:29,519
LIAM: Are we assuming it's going to be as easy as
all that?

259
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:34,234
LAURA: So, wait, a couple days and then we're
heading out? I thought we were heading out now.

260
00:17:34,234 --> 00:17:37,293
MATT: "Or meet up with you, I'm going by what
you're telling me. We can meet up whenever you'd like."

261
00:17:37,293 --> 00:17:38,855
LAURA: Are you coming with us?

262
00:17:38,855 --> 00:17:41,252
MATT: "I'm coming with you, yeah, but I have some
business to take care of here in the city before

263
00:17:41,252 --> 00:17:42,628
"we go ahead and head off."

264
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:44,544
LAURA: Well. Can we wait a day?

265
00:17:44,544 --> 00:17:50,458
LIAM: To have Kima with us, I think so, yes.

266
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:54,669
MATT: "Well, you guys are going-- where?"

267
00:17:54,669 --> 00:17:56,420
MARY: We were going to head to the Loch.

268
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,634
LAURA: To the Loch.

269
00:17:57,634 --> 00:17:59,370
WILL: What do you have to do in Vasselheim first?

270
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,557
TRAVIS: Oh, good question.

271
00:18:00,557 --> 00:18:05,057
MATT: She crosses her hands for a second and says,
"Why are you so interested in my business,

272
00:18:05,057 --> 00:18:06,342
"human?"

273
00:18:06,342 --> 00:18:11,929
WILL: Well, because if you're coming with us, then
we have to wait, so what you're deciding to do

274
00:18:11,929 --> 00:18:17,609
very much affects what we're doing. So let me ask
it a different way: what business do you have in

275
00:18:17,609 --> 00:18:18,822
Vasselheim?

276
00:18:18,822 --> 00:18:22,676
SAM: He just raised his voice a little, that was
the difference.

277
00:18:22,676 --> 00:18:24,359
TALIESIN: I didn't catch that.

278
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:35,357
MATT: "I was trying to arrange passage to the
east. Got a little bit of pull here in the city,

279
00:18:35,357 --> 00:18:43,606
"some favors that're owed to me, I figured maybe I
could do a favor, but that's, I don't know. If

280
00:18:43,606 --> 00:18:45,675
"you're going to have an attitude about it."

281
00:18:45,675 --> 00:18:48,438
WILL: Well then we're in trouble, I have an
attitude about everything.

282
00:18:48,438 --> 00:18:51,897
MARY: Pay him no mind, it's not personal. Kash.

283
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:56,874
WILL: What? I'm just, it's a logical question,
see, she's got something to do in Vasselheim, we

284
00:18:56,874 --> 00:19:00,487
have to wait, what does she have to do? I don't
feel like I'm talking out of turn.

285
00:19:00,487 --> 00:19:04,194
MARY: Making friends as always.

286
00:19:04,194 --> 00:19:11,534
MARISHA: To be fair, Kima and I had a rough start,
too. She's, I mean, I love you, Kima, but I mean

287
00:19:11,534 --> 00:19:16,704
sometimes, you can get a little bit of,
there's--

288
00:19:16,704 --> 00:19:20,274
MATT: "Are we meeting back in a couple days or are
we waiting, what's the business here, I--"

289
00:19:20,274 --> 00:19:21,406
MARISHA: Yeah.

290
00:19:21,406 --> 00:19:24,040
LIAM: How long do you need to get what you have
done? You need a day?

291
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:28,314
MATT: "I'm assuming a day, I have to try and find
a couple of folks and pull some strings."

292
00:19:28,314 --> 00:19:31,596
SAM: Do you need me to stay with you? To help
you?

293
00:19:31,596 --> 00:19:37,814
MATT: "No I'm fine. I've seen plenty of your
strengths in the past."

294
00:19:37,814 --> 00:19:40,221
SAM: And nipples.

295
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:41,630
LAURA: Okay.

296
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,394
WILL: We're missing something, I don't
understand.

297
00:19:43,394 --> 00:19:47,367
LAURA: I feel like we're missing something, wait,
you're trying to get us passage to the back--

298
00:19:47,367 --> 00:19:50,592
MARY: You're trying to get us passage to the
Knuckles place, is that, get them passage?

299
00:19:50,592 --> 00:19:54,994
LAURA: Or are you trying to get us to the lake?
I'm so confused. This is out of character, I

300
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:56,500
literally don't have an idea what's going on.

301
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,941
TRAVIS: I want to insight check Kima.

302
00:19:57,941 --> 00:20:00,069
(laughter)

303
00:20:00,069 --> 00:20:02,534
LIAM: Little rusty after three weeks, folks.

304
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:09,596
MATT: "Part of you coming and asking for the aid
of the palace was to help with this whole scourge

305
00:20:09,596 --> 00:20:14,276
"of dragons you're talking about to the east. The
ones that you say have destroyed most of Westruun

306
00:20:14,276 --> 00:20:19,584
"and most of my friends still exist in that area.
So I figure that's the passage we need to get

307
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:20,432
"over there."

308
00:20:20,432 --> 00:20:22,566
MARISHA: When you mean east, you mean like, far
east.

309
00:20:22,566 --> 00:20:23,912
MATT: "Eeeeast."

310
00:20:23,912 --> 00:20:26,957
MARISHA: Like really, okay. Well, no, there's
time.

311
00:20:26,957 --> 00:20:34,520
LAURA: Here's the thing. Also, our lady Keyleth,
the beautiful princess that lives among us, she

312
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:40,490
has a way she can travel us very very quickly
through trees, so we don't actually need passage.

313
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,166
MATT: "Through trees."

314
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:47,735
MARISHA: It's a new skill I've picked up since we
hung out last.

315
00:20:47,735 --> 00:20:49,215
MATT: "That's weird."

316
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:51,390
TRAVIS: No, it's really quite painless. It's
pretty cool.

317
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:55,295
MARISHA: It's, yeah, and it has a nice cedar scent
when you go through.

318
00:20:55,295 --> 00:21:01,157
LAURA: So unless we're getting supplies and we
need to travel with a lot of things, then, you

319
00:21:01,157 --> 00:21:03,277
know, we don't actually need passage.

320
00:21:03,277 --> 00:21:13,225
MARISHA: Also, I need to go by the Fire Ashari
before we really head east-east, and they're west.

321
00:21:13,225 --> 00:21:15,334
So.

322
00:21:15,334 --> 00:21:17,684
WILL: Yeah, there's like 37 things we have to do
before, so.

323
00:21:17,684 --> 00:21:21,942
LIAM: We need to carve out a plan, Kash is right,
we should pick something short-term and do

324
00:21:21,942 --> 00:21:23,190
something because--

325
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,588
TALIESIN: Let's head to the Loch.

326
00:21:24,588 --> 00:21:28,432
MARISHA: The Loch is on the way to the Fire Ashari
anyway.

327
00:21:28,432 --> 00:21:35,837
LAURA: Do you think that this is going to lead to
some serious fighting? Because it sounds like

328
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:38,332
these Vestiges are well-guarded.

329
00:21:38,332 --> 00:21:43,402
TRAVIS: Well, you don't have any reason to think
that. Could be hanging from a tree branch.

330
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:47,835
LAURA: I'm sure. You know what, Grog, that's an
excellent point.

331
00:21:47,835 --> 00:21:50,506
TRAVIS: Yeah. Just hiding in plain sight.

332
00:21:50,506 --> 00:21:53,648
LAURA: Hanging on a tree branch under the lake.

333
00:21:53,648 --> 00:21:55,120
TRAVIS: That's where I'd hide it.

334
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:00,783
MARISHA: Z, Kash, you all have been by the Loch
before, would you know what--

335
00:22:00,783 --> 00:22:03,628
WILL: It was pretty unremarkable last time we were
there if it's the one I'm thinking of.

336
00:22:03,628 --> 00:22:12,016
MARY: Actually, I may have remembered something
about the Loch? What do I, would I have remembered

337
00:22:12,016 --> 00:22:13,708
anything at all?

338
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:17,150
MATT: Make a history check.

339
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:18,927
MARY: What do I do for that?

340
00:22:18,927 --> 00:22:24,436
LAURA: Roll a 20 and add it to your history. So
11.

341
00:22:24,436 --> 00:22:30,258
MARY: 11. Is that an eight?

342
00:22:30,258 --> 00:22:32,658
MATT: It's a pretty unremarkable Loch.

343
00:22:32,658 --> 00:22:34,203
MARY: It's a pretty unremarkable Loch.

344
00:22:34,203 --> 00:22:40,355
MATT: As far as lakes go, it's maybe a few hundred
feet across. It's more from a part of the land

345
00:22:40,355 --> 00:22:45,766
mass actually having a large sinkhole and where
certain things may have existed, and there are

346
00:22:45,766 --> 00:22:50,653
bits of ruin throughout the surroundings of some
sort of a structure that existed there, but most

347
00:22:50,653 --> 00:22:55,000
of it seems to have been swallowed up by the
ground and the lake has formed in its place,

348
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:02,522
though this was quite some time ago. And it swells
or drains based on how much snowfall there has

349
00:23:02,522 --> 00:23:06,952
been in recent seasons, and it's been a pretty
heavy winter for you guys, so you imagine from the

350
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:10,011
times you've seen it that it's been pretty high, if
not frozen over at times.

351
00:23:10,011 --> 00:23:16,186
MARY: So it's rather unremarkable, but I think
it's something that we can handle, definitely,

352
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:18,181
within a 24-hour period.

353
00:23:18,181 --> 00:23:21,471
LAURA: Well, we just loaded up on a bunch of
potions. Some dickhead.

354
00:23:21,471 --> 00:23:27,981
MARISHA: I am with Vex, though, I have a feeling
that the chance that this item has been completely

355
00:23:27,981 --> 00:23:30,604
forgotten is not likely.

356
00:23:30,604 --> 00:23:38,517
LIAM: Well, we need allies and we need power
because we're not in shape to take care of a coven

357
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:43,613
of dragons at the moment. Seems like slightly
lower-hanging fruit than the other option?

358
00:23:43,613 --> 00:23:45,420
MARISHA and LAURA: Let's try it.

359
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:48,232
SAM: What time of day is it right now?

360
00:23:48,232 --> 00:23:53,190
MATT: At this time, it's probably, say,
midafternoon.

361
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:57,378
LAURA: Well, we're not going to get there before
dark, so maybe we should sleep here tonight and

362
00:23:57,378 --> 00:23:58,729
start out in the morning.

363
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:02,096
TRAVIS: Well, I have a question, and not like I
can really help with this, but should we go see if

364
00:24:02,096 --> 00:24:08,930
we can read about some article of shadow-death,
whatever the fuck it's called? Like, is it in a

365
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:09,873
library?

366
00:24:09,873 --> 00:24:13,354
LAURA: Maybe the Slayer's Take knows more about
the lake, about these Vest-- no, these are pretty

367
00:24:13,354 --> 00:24:16,651
secret, I think the Vestiges are a pretty
well-kept secret, people aren't going to just know

368
00:24:16,651 --> 00:24:17,909
where they are.

369
00:24:17,909 --> 00:24:22,201
TRAVIS: No? Like what if they're super-old but
they go by a different name or something?

370
00:24:22,201 --> 00:24:24,624
LAURA: I wonder if somebody knows about a cavern
under the lake.

371
00:24:24,624 --> 00:24:28,207
TALIESIN: That's what I would assume, is there
must be some sort of underground structure, some

372
00:24:28,207 --> 00:24:31,126
part of the ruins.

373
00:24:31,126 --> 00:24:33,398
LAURA: Or maybe we need to breathe
under-fricking-water.

374
00:24:33,398 --> 00:24:35,374
TRAVIS: Oh, I've got two vials of that shit.

375
00:24:35,374 --> 00:24:44,855
MARISHA: Why don't we take the rest of the night
to try and do some research. Is there any way we

376
00:24:44,855 --> 00:24:49,120
can find maybe maps or something about ancient
history books?

377
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,842
MARY: And I do have a map from the Slayer's Take
that I could--

378
00:24:52,842 --> 00:24:56,944
MARISHA: Oh, no, but I mean, we need to find like
books about civilizations that might've been here

379
00:24:56,944 --> 00:25:00,567
in the past that might get us some sort of-- Like
a library. Is there a library?

380
00:25:00,567 --> 00:25:02,544
TRAVIS: Pictures or no pictures?

381
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:04,340
MARISHA: There might be some pictures.

382
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,284
TRAVIS: All right. I'm in.

383
00:25:06,284 --> 00:25:08,497
LAURA: Is there a library nearby?

384
00:25:08,497 --> 00:25:14,432
MATT: (laughs) Oh, it's been two weeks and I
missed you guys.

385
00:25:14,432 --> 00:25:16,896
WILL: Do we have a library at the Take?

386
00:25:16,896 --> 00:25:21,944
MATT: Hm? There are a collection of books at the
Take, but most of them are in reference to

387
00:25:21,944 --> 00:25:30,179
cataloging various creatures, details about their
lifestyles, their inherent weaknesses, what

388
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:34,661
elements of their bodies can be harvested and what
clients are usually looking for. It's more

389
00:25:34,661 --> 00:25:40,577
specific to the business of the Slayer's Take than
anything that would involve local history. I mean,

390
00:25:40,577 --> 00:25:47,660
I'll say if two of you would like to make an
investigation check between the two, your choice,

391
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,896
whoever wants to do that, we'll base, see what
information you can find.

392
00:25:49,896 --> 00:25:53,280
SAM: I feel good about my investigation, I have a
keen eye.

393
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:58,141
LAURA: I've got a pretty decent investigation. You
and me, brother.

394
00:25:58,141 --> 00:26:00,099
SAM: Let's do this.

395
00:26:00,099 --> 00:26:03,689
LAURA: All right. 23.

396
00:26:03,689 --> 00:26:08,114
SAM: Not as good, but pretty good. 17.

397
00:26:08,114 --> 00:26:16,211
MATT: 17. In taking the better part of the rest of
the day and asking around, you manage to find one

398
00:26:16,211 --> 00:26:23,182
location that carries books, and what you would
consider as sort of like a library, though nothing

399
00:26:23,182 --> 00:26:30,448
of the ancient historical fashion. There are many
books about the history of the temples here in the

400
00:26:30,448 --> 00:26:36,960
town, elements of the battles of old, but they're
all very vague in their writing as almost like a

401
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:44,952
story as opposed to a historical
fact-gathering-type presentation. You manage to

402
00:26:44,952 --> 00:26:53,695
find a place that does deal in dusty books,
partially repaired and restored books, a little

403
00:26:53,695 --> 00:27:03,231
bit pricier, but there is one tome that seems to
talk specifically about the history of the Raven

404
00:27:03,231 --> 00:27:14,488
Queen's rise here in the city, and if you would
like to possibly take this book, for a price, that

405
00:27:14,488 --> 00:27:15,682
is up to you.

406
00:27:15,682 --> 00:27:17,354
LAURA: Is somebody watching me at the moment?

407
00:27:17,354 --> 00:27:18,593
SAM: Have I rejoined her?

408
00:27:18,593 --> 00:27:20,273
MATT: No, you guys are doing this separately.

409
00:27:20,273 --> 00:27:22,890
LAURA: Are we just perusing a bookstore, or--?

410
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:30,227
MATT: Essentially right now you are, it's a small
place, but there are two employees, and it's not

411
00:27:30,227 --> 00:27:33,332
very busy at all, you're the only person in the
room, so they're both just quietly watching from a

412
00:27:33,332 --> 00:27:33,961
distance.

413
00:27:33,961 --> 00:27:36,133
LAURA: I sit down on the ground and start reading
through the book.

414
00:27:36,133 --> 00:27:38,136
SAM: Barnes and Noble-style?

415
00:27:38,136 --> 00:27:40,583
LAURA: And see if I can find information.

416
00:27:40,583 --> 00:27:47,216
MATT: Well, about 30 seconds into that, one of the
employees comes up and goes, "Excuse me, miss--"

417
00:27:47,216 --> 00:27:48,429
LAURA: Oh, hi!

418
00:27:48,429 --> 00:27:49,848
MATT: "If you are going to--"

419
00:27:49,848 --> 00:27:50,893
LAURA: I keep reading.

420
00:27:50,893 --> 00:27:55,260
MATT: "I would ask if you would wish to read this
to purchase it, as that is our business, we are

421
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:59,834
"not an open place to just utilize the
information."

422
00:27:59,834 --> 00:28:01,642
LAURA: Oh, I thought this was a library!

423
00:28:01,642 --> 00:28:10,065
MATT: "It's a book sale collection, please, if
you're going to read it, please purchase the book.

424
00:28:10,065 --> 00:28:11,203
"Or leave?"

425
00:28:11,203 --> 00:28:13,992
LAURA: Of course, well, can I just check and make
sure that it's actually got any information that I

426
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:16,847
need? Because if it doesn't then I don't want to
buy it. You understand.

427
00:28:16,847 --> 00:28:22,660
MATT: "You may peruse for but a moment. If you do
not find an essence of what you're seeking at that

428
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,947
"time, I would have to ask you to leave."

429
00:28:24,947 --> 00:28:28,784
LAURA: All right, of course, yes. Are you just
going to stand there and watch me peruse then?

430
00:28:28,784 --> 00:28:30,117
MATT: "Yes."

431
00:28:30,117 --> 00:28:32,764
LAURA: Well, I just start looking for what I
need.

432
00:28:32,764 --> 00:28:38,997
MATT: In the brief time that you have going
through, you manage to glean, there is a chapter

433
00:28:38,997 --> 00:28:51,352
that speaks of the Divergence, it speaks of the
last large struggle that happened in the center of

434
00:28:51,352 --> 00:28:58,317
civilization. This was the second battle before
the gods themselves fully rescinded from the land

435
00:28:58,317 --> 00:29:04,352
itself. And the Raven Queen did have a number of
chosen champions as a part of this endeavor, and

436
00:29:04,352 --> 00:29:08,417
that's as far as you get before he goes, "All
right, so, you've had a bit of time."

437
00:29:08,417 --> 00:29:14,159
LAURA: I just don't know, I can't really tell if
it actually has anything interesting.

438
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,511
MATT: There is a tag on the book that says 30
gold.

439
00:29:16,511 --> 00:29:23,273
LAURA: What's the back? That's 30 gold! 30 gold.
It's so dusty, though, I mean is that even worth

440
00:29:23,273 --> 00:29:32,097
it if it's this dusty? 30 gold? Does it have
spells in it? No.

441
00:29:32,097 --> 00:29:36,366
MATT: He reaches out and grabs the book and says,
"If you are not a serious collector, I'm sorry,

442
00:29:36,366 --> 00:29:37,752
"then it seems that we--"

443
00:29:37,752 --> 00:29:39,176
LAURA: Oh. Oh.

444
00:29:39,176 --> 00:29:40,534
MATT: And he starts pulling it, tugging it up.

445
00:29:40,534 --> 00:29:48,427
LAURA: No! I hold onto it. Well, I know people
that, you know, care about dirty old books, so I

446
00:29:48,427 --> 00:29:55,087
guess, I mean, I might be willing to purchase it
for them, but they usually like things in mint

447
00:29:55,087 --> 00:30:01,384
condition when they buy their antiques. This has a
damaged spine, I see it, and yellowing of the

448
00:30:01,384 --> 00:30:06,094
pages. And it seems like somebody's bookmarked
this one.

449
00:30:06,094 --> 00:30:08,748
SAM: It wasn't kept in its neoprene sleeve.

450
00:30:08,748 --> 00:30:16,886
MATT: He slams the book shut as you're perusing
through the pages. "30 gold, or I will ask you to

451
00:30:16,886 --> 00:30:17,992
"leave."

452
00:30:17,992 --> 00:30:21,062
LAURA: Oh. This is the worst haggling ever.

453
00:30:21,062 --> 00:30:23,473
SAM: Get out your buyer's guide.

454
00:30:23,473 --> 00:30:26,727
LAURA: What's your name?

455
00:30:26,727 --> 00:30:28,888
(groaning)

456
00:30:28,888 --> 00:30:30,302
SAM: Just kill him!

457
00:30:30,302 --> 00:30:34,940
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

458
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,764
LIAM: Oh, good grief.

459
00:30:36,764 --> 00:30:43,168
LAURA: 18?

460
00:30:43,168 --> 00:30:46,308
TALIESIN: We have robbed cadavers.

461
00:30:46,308 --> 00:30:58,330
MATT: "As far as you're concerned right now, my
name is No Sale." And pulls the book back.

462
00:30:58,405 --> 00:31:08,250
LAURA: I feel hurt, and I pull out 30 gold and I
say, I suppose-- (weakly) I'll buy it.

463
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:11,137
MATT: Takes the gold, hands you the tome.

464
00:31:11,137 --> 00:31:14,945
LAURA: Damn it! It hurts! It hurts me in my soul.

465
00:31:14,945 --> 00:31:19,419
MARISHA: That's the first time I've ever seen Vex
pay full price for anything.

466
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:23,709
MARY: Is that the first time you've ever paid full
price for anything?

467
00:31:23,709 --> 00:31:25,754
LAURA: It is, actually. The first time.

468
00:31:25,754 --> 00:31:29,121
MARY: Momentous occasion. Hunter's Mark that son
of a bitch.

469
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:37,841
LAURA: I kind of respect you. I'm a little impressed.

470
00:31:37,841 --> 00:31:42,454
MATT: "Benjamin Cole, should you find your way
around here again and wish to pay full price for

471
00:31:42,454 --> 00:31:43,977
"another one of our fine books."

472
00:31:43,977 --> 00:31:47,911
LAURA: Benjamin Cole. You're a dear.

473
00:31:47,911 --> 00:32:01,006
MATT: "Come again," he says begrudgingly as you
exit the facility. So, looking through the book,

474
00:32:01,006 --> 00:32:09,083
it does talk about-- specifically, there are a few
champions. Many that were lost entirely to the

475
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:16,932
battle, unrecovered. One of the highest of the
Order of the Raven Queen, that fought in her name,

476
00:32:16,932 --> 00:32:25,006
was named Purvan--

477
00:32:25,006 --> 00:32:27,237
LAURA: (cackles) Yeah, he was.

478
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:28,651
MARISHA: "Perv on?"

479
00:32:28,651 --> 00:32:31,090
MATT: Purvan. P-U-R-V-A-N.

480
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:33,344
SAM: Last name Pedobear.

481
00:32:33,344 --> 00:32:36,646
(laughter)

482
00:32:36,646 --> 00:32:39,045
TALIESIN: We're running out of good names, aren't
we? We've finally gotten to the end of your list

483
00:32:39,045 --> 00:32:40,717
of good names.

484
00:32:40,717 --> 00:32:41,953
TRAVIS: (giggling) Purvan Pedobear?

485
00:32:41,953 --> 00:32:43,846
MATT: Oh, you guys are cruising to a TPK today.

486
00:32:43,846 --> 00:32:44,898
(laughter)

487
00:32:44,898 --> 00:32:47,084
LAURA: Not on the anniversary, Matt! Not on the
anniversary.

488
00:32:47,084 --> 00:32:49,014
MATT: No, this is great.

489
00:32:49,014 --> 00:32:51,422
TRAVIS: (giggling) Purvan Pedobear.

490
00:32:51,422 --> 00:32:55,590
MARY: Kash and Z were left staring at the bodies.

491
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:56,778
MATT: (with great emphasis) Purvan--

492
00:32:56,778 --> 00:33:01,489
LIAM: Yes, yes, get your perv on! Emphatically.

493
00:33:01,489 --> 00:33:10,189
MATT: All right. That's more hit points onto these
guys here, for later. All right.

494
00:33:10,189 --> 00:33:16,893
MARY: Perv on, MacDuff. Perv on.

495
00:33:16,893 --> 00:33:23,882
MATT: Purvan Suul is the full name, though the
name was given to the Raven Queen at the time of

496
00:33:23,882 --> 00:33:32,854
signing itself to the order, in which they become
nameless. The champions are just mentioned or

497
00:33:32,854 --> 00:33:37,585
spoken of in public as The Champion, so the name
is part of the gift they give to the Raven Queen

498
00:33:37,585 --> 00:33:45,021
when they swear themselves to her. Fell in the
final conflict and was interred within a tomb to

499
00:33:45,021 --> 00:33:58,610
the west of Vasselheim. It is said that it is a
multi-leveled tomb, and as the Raven Queen's

500
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:05,310
fellowship began to fall out of favor after the
Divergence had happened-- essentially, because her

501
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:10,038
realm is death, during times of great conflict and
strife, there is great power and a lot of energy

502
00:34:10,038 --> 00:34:13,642
given towards the Raven Queen. When things fall
into peace time, or at least, for an extended

503
00:34:13,642 --> 00:34:20,302
period of time, there isn't a lot of conflict or
burgeoning death and destruction within the

504
00:34:20,302 --> 00:34:28,151
vicinity, her worship tends to dwindle. As that
dwindled, there wasn't enough people within the

505
00:34:28,151 --> 00:34:34,717
remaining bloodlines to maintain the tomb. It fell
into disuse and since then has not been tended to.

506
00:34:34,717 --> 00:34:37,636
TRAVIS: Yeah, nobody's there.

507
00:34:37,636 --> 00:34:42,151
LAURA: There's definitely going to be ghosts
there. Kashaw?

508
00:34:42,151 --> 00:34:43,204
WILL: Yeah?

509
00:34:43,204 --> 00:34:46,297
LAURA: Do your holy shit when we go there, all
right?

510
00:34:46,297 --> 00:34:51,588
WILL: I will absolutely do my holy shit. You don't
want to see the god, but we'll do the rest of the

511
00:34:51,588 --> 00:34:54,776
holy shit. We'll be fine.

512
00:34:54,776 --> 00:35:00,536
LAURA: Oh, really? Is it not, like, Sarenrae?
Sarenrae? Is that your god?

513
00:35:00,536 --> 00:35:01,607
WILL: No.

514
00:35:01,607 --> 00:35:04,599
TRAVIS: No, he's married, remember?

515
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:07,991
LAURA: You're married to a god?! Wait, you're
married and you--

516
00:35:07,991 --> 00:35:10,060
MARISHA: Wait. We didn't have that conversation
with her.

517
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:13,200
WILL: Yeah, we didn't. For the record, she married
me, and there's a difference.

518
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,038
SAM: You're married?

519
00:35:15,038 --> 00:35:16,543
WILL: Technically.

520
00:35:16,543 --> 00:35:18,529
MARISHA: I don't know if that holds up in court,
Vesh.

521
00:35:18,529 --> 00:35:24,529
WILL: She's not really going to care about court
so much as ripping the bones from your back. You

522
00:35:24,529 --> 00:35:28,158
really don't want to meet her. It's a bad thing.
But yes! We can do a whole lot of stuff to get

523
00:35:28,158 --> 00:35:29,477
through the ghosts.

524
00:35:29,477 --> 00:35:30,452
LAURA: Good times.

525
00:35:30,452 --> 00:35:32,425
WILL: We'll just stay away from her. They weren't
good times.

526
00:35:32,425 --> 00:35:33,551
LAURA: I want to hear more about this.

527
00:35:33,551 --> 00:35:34,637
WILL: You really don't. You won't sleep.

528
00:35:34,637 --> 00:35:36,438
TRAVIS: So we also need maps, right? We need your
maps.

529
00:35:36,438 --> 00:35:37,929
MARY: Yes, I've got maps.

530
00:35:37,929 --> 00:35:39,882
TRAVIS: Wait, don't you have something for me,
also?

531
00:35:39,882 --> 00:35:45,547
MARY: Yes, I do. Oh, yes! I do, actually. I
forgot. I did keep it with me. As drunk as I was,

532
00:35:45,547 --> 00:35:52,358
I do remember telling you about the Moon Hammer.
So I did. I brought it. And I give this to you, my

533
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:54,805
friend. I'm very excited.

534
00:35:54,805 --> 00:35:58,578
TRAVIS: How big is it? I know I'm looking at it,
but what does it look like?

535
00:35:58,578 --> 00:36:01,232
MATT: You go ahead and explain.

536
00:36:01,232 --> 00:36:02,659
MARY: No, go right ahead.

537
00:36:02,659 --> 00:36:16,359
MATT: It is a fine, smooth, dark metal warhammer
that as the handle itself leads towards the heavy head

538
00:36:16,359 --> 00:36:26,457
portion of the hammer, the metal turns instead to
almost a glistening ivory that has symbols pushed

539
00:36:26,457 --> 00:36:33,976
into it. A language you don't understand, but
there's a giant moon crescent carved into each

540
00:36:33,976 --> 00:36:36,107
side of the hammer's head.

541
00:36:36,107 --> 00:36:37,581
TRAVIS: Whoa.

542
00:36:37,581 --> 00:36:39,171
MARY: It took me weeks to forge it.

543
00:36:39,171 --> 00:36:43,438
TRAVIS: This is beautiful. Can I hit something
with it?

544
00:36:43,438 --> 00:36:44,648
MARY: Sure.

545
00:36:44,648 --> 00:36:46,430
TRAVIS: What can I hit with it?

546
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:47,878
MARY: Scanlan, where are you?

547
00:36:47,878 --> 00:36:49,112
TRAVIS: Scanlan, come here.

548
00:36:49,112 --> 00:36:50,943
SAM: What's up? What do you need?

549
00:36:50,943 --> 00:36:52,180
TRAVIS: Just stand right there.

550
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,607
SAM: Sure. Whatever you need.

551
00:36:53,607 --> 00:36:58,490
TRAVIS: I reach back halfway and give a
quarter-measure (whoomp). Right into Scanlan.

552
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:04,999
MATT: Make an attack roll. We'll say with
disadvantage because you were taking a

553
00:37:04,999 --> 00:37:06,332
half-measure.

554
00:37:06,332 --> 00:37:11,608
TRAVIS: About the same as the Firebrand-ish?

555
00:37:11,608 --> 00:37:15,085
MATT: It's technically non-magical.

556
00:37:15,085 --> 00:37:16,531
TRAVIS: Okay. 14.

557
00:37:16,531 --> 00:37:22,317
MATT: 14. You manage to just barely, as you see
this thing coming towards you, and duck beneath it.

558
00:37:22,317 --> 00:37:26,881
SAM: I thought you were going to tell me a dirty
joke, or something! When you say "come here,"

559
00:37:26,881 --> 00:37:28,479
usually that's what that means!

560
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:30,152
TRAVIS: No, I wanted to try out the hammer.

561
00:37:30,152 --> 00:37:35,239
SAM: Oh. Well then, no! Try it on Vax.

562
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:37,153
LIAM: I'm already 20 paces away.

563
00:37:37,153 --> 00:37:38,264
TRAVIS: Vax?

564
00:37:38,264 --> 00:37:39,815
LIAM: I go stealth.

565
00:37:39,815 --> 00:37:43,004
MATT: Roll stealth. Roll a perception check.

566
00:37:43,004 --> 00:37:45,848
TRAVIS: Vax! Shit!

567
00:37:45,848 --> 00:37:47,044
LIAM: 27.

568
00:37:47,044 --> 00:37:48,256
TRAVIS: Two.

569
00:37:48,256 --> 00:37:53,814
(laughter)

570
00:37:53,814 --> 00:37:56,275
MATT: Try as you might to look around, Vax is
nowhere to be seen.

571
00:37:56,275 --> 00:38:00,073
LIAM: I literally just pivoted around my sister
and pressed against her.

572
00:38:00,073 --> 00:38:03,439
TRAVIS: Doing exactly what she does?

573
00:38:03,439 --> 00:38:10,690
SAM: I'm going to use Minor Illusion to make a
really shitty Vax. A really cruddy-looking Vax.

574
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:12,291
LAURA: Not in Vasselheim!

575
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:14,158
SAM: Oh, shit. Too late.

576
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:22,233
MATT: Too late. So as you're looking around, you
see this strange quiver of shadow that seems to

577
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:34,398
formulate in the air, and this awkward, still,
unmoving, awkward mannequin-type visual recreation

578
00:38:34,398 --> 00:38:37,450
of Vax muddles itself there. I need you to roll an
insight check.

579
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:39,239
MARY: (laughs) Please be low.

580
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:41,058
TRAVIS: It is. Four.

581
00:38:41,058 --> 00:38:44,381
(laughter)

582
00:38:44,381 --> 00:38:50,984
MATT: Finally! Vax cannot evade your vision this
time, Grog.

583
00:38:50,984 --> 00:39:01,947
TRAVIS: You stand right there. I swing down in an
arc to try and hit Vax.

584
00:39:01,947 --> 00:39:11,708
MATT: Okay. With this weird, awkward half-grin
frozen in place. The hammer streaks down through

585
00:39:11,708 --> 00:39:17,395
this form and passes completely through it,
slamming into the mud beneath, splattering mud up

586
00:39:17,395 --> 00:39:22,995
and around you, across your chest, and for a brief
instant, Vax completely seems to have evaded the

587
00:39:22,995 --> 00:39:24,039
attack.

588
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:28,481
TRAVIS: (yelps) I killed him! He's all over me!
His bits are all over me!

589
00:39:28,481 --> 00:39:32,261
LAURA: Grog, how could you?! My brother!

590
00:39:32,261 --> 00:39:33,987
TRAVIS: What did you give me?!

591
00:39:33,987 --> 00:39:35,447
MARY: It's a hell of a hammer, isn't it?

592
00:39:35,447 --> 00:39:38,505
MATT: With that, the illusion is dissipated and
Vax is no longer there before you.

593
00:39:38,505 --> 00:39:43,041
TRAVIS: (screams) (weakly) I've killed him. I've
killed poor Vax.

594
00:39:43,041 --> 00:39:44,409
MARY: Come here, darling.

595
00:39:44,409 --> 00:39:47,041
TRAVIS: What is this evil monstrosity?

596
00:39:47,041 --> 00:39:52,857
MARY: No. Come here. I lead him around the side of
Vex.

597
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:56,358
LIAM: Hey, big guy.

598
00:39:56,358 --> 00:40:03,732
TRAVIS: You're alive! Come here! And give him a
big ol' squeeze. And I squeeze a little tighter to

599
00:40:03,732 --> 00:40:06,879
make sure he doesn't turn into mud. You turned
into mud last time.

600
00:40:06,879 --> 00:40:11,291
MATT: The harder he squeezes you, you fear you may
turn into mud.

601
00:40:11,291 --> 00:40:16,236
TRAVIS: Did it hurt? Did the Moon Hammer hurt
you?

602
00:40:16,236 --> 00:40:25,738
LIAM: No. No, I was able to dodge both ways apart,
and then came back together. It's my cloak does that.

603
00:40:25,738 --> 00:40:30,357
TRAVIS: Shit, this is like-- we're going to save
this for the really nasty fellas. All right, I'm

604
00:40:30,357 --> 00:40:31,825
going to put this in the bag.

605
00:40:31,825 --> 00:40:32,819
MARY: All right.

606
00:40:32,819 --> 00:40:36,904
TRAVIS: You know, if a kid or Scanlan or Pike sees
it? She'll be so furious.

607
00:40:36,904 --> 00:40:38,247
MARY: Yeah, she'll be terrified.

608
00:40:38,247 --> 00:40:39,794
TRAVIS: I put it in the Bag of Holding.

609
00:40:39,794 --> 00:40:44,484
MATT: All right. At this point, Kima has pulled a
small flask out and takes a swig and goes, (sighs)

610
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:47,824
"Ah, I've missed you."

611
00:40:47,824 --> 00:40:50,681
WILL: Can you give me a swig of that? Come on.

612
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:54,145
LAURA: Best friends forever. (gasps)

613
00:40:54,145 --> 00:41:01,087
TRAVIS: (grunts, splutters) Respect.

614
00:41:01,087 --> 00:41:04,404
WILL: Fair enough.

615
00:41:04,404 --> 00:41:07,773
MATT: "So. Are we resting, or are we off? I'm
growing impatient."

616
00:41:07,773 --> 00:41:09,298
TRAVIS and LAURA: We're off.

617
00:41:09,298 --> 00:41:12,097
LAURA: We're going to go. We're going to camp
overnight, yeah?

618
00:41:12,097 --> 00:41:13,473
WILL: Sounds perfectly safe.

619
00:41:13,473 --> 00:41:16,125
LAURA: You know what?

620
00:41:16,125 --> 00:41:18,465
TALIESIN: It doesn't matter if it's going to be
daylight if we're underground.

621
00:41:18,465 --> 00:41:24,595
LAURA: That's true. All right. I just think,
outside of Vasselheim, you know, things come out

622
00:41:24,595 --> 00:41:26,589
at night, but whatever.

623
00:41:26,589 --> 00:41:27,806
WILL: We've killed a lot of them.

624
00:41:27,806 --> 00:41:28,747
MARY: Yeah, we have.

625
00:41:28,747 --> 00:41:33,666
LAURA: If you guys think this is the most
brilliant decision, I'm on board.

626
00:41:33,666 --> 00:41:38,772
TALIESIN: I'm actually hoping that it's the worst
decision we make, because then everything's

627
00:41:38,772 --> 00:41:40,029
uphill.

628
00:41:40,029 --> 00:41:42,452
LAURA: So much wisdom.

629
00:41:42,452 --> 00:41:43,896
TALIESIN: Thank you. I'm just trying to bring--

630
00:41:43,896 --> 00:41:47,412
TRAVIS: Let's do it. We're out.

631
00:41:47,412 --> 00:41:53,042
MARY: Having passed the loch before, would we have
an idea of what we might anticipate on the way?

632
00:41:53,042 --> 00:41:56,690
MATT: There are all sorts of things that you could
anticipate along the way. There are a number of

633
00:41:56,690 --> 00:42:02,252
denizens of this forest that are all sorts of
levels of danger. There are roving orcish bands

634
00:42:02,252 --> 00:42:09,240
from the far, far northwest, which you encountered
on your way to Rimefang. There are a number of

635
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:15,699
other creatures that wander these areas: some of
them bestial, some with some element of culture.

636
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:24,243
There are bandits that come from the far west,
possibly from across that sea that occasionally try and

637
00:42:24,243 --> 00:42:29,720
kill and pillage as best they can. Most everyone
avoids the city of Vasselheim, because that place

638
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:34,154
is pretty hardcore by comparison. So yeah, all
kinds of things you could find.

639
00:42:34,154 --> 00:42:37,112
MARY: Then I think we should go. We can handle it.
Yeah, I'm ready.

640
00:42:37,112 --> 00:42:39,336
LAURA: Keyleth, can't you turn us all to mist, and
then we poof there?

641
00:42:39,336 --> 00:42:43,188
MARISHA: I was going to say, do you want to Mist
Walk this? It would be appropriate this time.

642
00:42:43,188 --> 00:42:44,985
LAURA: Then we could be there before the evening.

643
00:42:44,985 --> 00:42:46,917
TRAVIS: Can we control the direction that we
move?

644
00:42:46,917 --> 00:42:48,071
MARISHA: Yes.

645
00:42:48,071 --> 00:42:51,978
LAURA: Can you Mist Walk us all, including
Trinket?

646
00:42:51,978 --> 00:42:53,638
LIAM: Context is everything.

647
00:42:53,638 --> 00:42:55,455
TALIESIN: Better double-check that.

648
00:42:55,455 --> 00:42:57,506
MARISHA: Let me see how many people I can do.

649
00:42:57,506 --> 00:42:58,784
TRAVIS: How far away is it? Ish?

650
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:04,859
MATT: At a fast pace on foot, it would take you
seven to eight hours.

651
00:43:04,859 --> 00:43:08,094
MARY: I know a place where we can get horses, as
well.

652
00:43:08,094 --> 00:43:10,227
LAURA: Horses would die out there.

653
00:43:10,227 --> 00:43:14,411
MARY: That's all right. They've died before. 
Might need food, as well.

654
00:43:14,411 --> 00:43:16,246
MATT: You guys have a great history of--

655
00:43:16,246 --> 00:43:17,875
SAM: Killing horses?

656
00:43:17,875 --> 00:43:20,979
LIAM: I say we let Keyleth handle it. We swish out
and camp for the night.

657
00:43:20,979 --> 00:43:23,262
SAM: Let's go. Just do it.

658
00:43:23,262 --> 00:43:25,096
MATT: Up to ten willing creatures for Wind Walk.

659
00:43:25,096 --> 00:43:27,301
LAURA: Yay! Let's do it.

660
00:43:27,301 --> 00:43:30,017
MATT: All right.

661
00:43:30,017 --> 00:43:33,592
MARY and LAURA: (ghost noises)

662
00:43:33,592 --> 00:43:36,843
MARY: We're like a giant fart.

663
00:43:36,843 --> 00:43:43,781
MATT: For some of you, it's a familiar, if still
uncomfortable, physical feeling as your body--

664
00:43:43,781 --> 00:43:45,704
MARISHA: Just accept it.

665
00:43:45,704 --> 00:43:47,081
WILL: What's happening?

666
00:43:47,081 --> 00:43:48,246
MARISHA: Just accept it.

667
00:43:48,246 --> 00:43:53,951
MATT: You become this amorphous, cloudy, vaporous
form. You can fly at a very swift speed, even

668
00:43:53,951 --> 00:43:55,652
against a relatively strong wind.

669
00:43:55,652 --> 00:43:58,238
LAURA: We probably should have talked out our
plan before we did this.

670
00:43:58,238 --> 00:44:04,673
MATT: Trinket in his mist form is
seemingly very uncomfortable with this

671
00:44:04,673 --> 00:44:05,504
circumstance.

672
00:44:05,504 --> 00:44:08,659
MARY: I use Beast Speech. Are you all right? Are
you all right, Trinket? Everything okay? I can

673
00:44:08,659 --> 00:44:09,672
speak to him.

674
00:44:09,672 --> 00:44:10,926
MATT: "What's happening?"

675
00:44:10,926 --> 00:44:14,136
MARY: It's all right, darling. We're going to a
loch. It's going to be great fishing for you.

676
00:44:14,136 --> 00:44:15,456
MATT: "I will follow."

677
00:44:15,456 --> 00:44:17,224
LAURA: We can talk in mist form?

678
00:44:17,224 --> 00:44:18,331
MATT: Sure.

679
00:44:18,331 --> 00:44:23,123
(laughter)

680
00:44:23,123 --> 00:44:24,780
MATT: At this point, I don't give a shit.

681
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:26,604
WILL: Your fun is wrong. Your fun is wrong!

682
00:44:26,604 --> 00:44:27,903
MARY: Your fun is wrong.

683
00:44:27,903 --> 00:44:28,858
TRAVIS: The t-shirt exists.

684
00:44:28,858 --> 00:44:30,286
MARY: It does. Thanks.

685
00:44:30,286 --> 00:44:37,083
MATT: I can imagine as part of the enchantment, as
you guys can pass wind through your mist vocal cords.

686
00:44:37,083 --> 00:44:39,204
MARY: Just about everything. He's very good at
passing wind.

687
00:44:39,204 --> 00:44:40,771
MATT: Oh, he's delightful.

688
00:44:40,771 --> 00:44:43,206
TRAVIS: You really should just chain up with me
and I'll get us there super quick.

689
00:44:43,206 --> 00:44:52,465
MATT: All right, so you guys begin to head
westward, following your previous experience at

690
00:44:52,465 --> 00:44:59,202
the direction that it takes you. You push that
way. Kima is also still getting used to this whole

691
00:44:59,202 --> 00:45:03,101
mist form endeavor. It takes a little bit for you
guys to adjust to this locomotion, but it is very

692
00:45:03,101 --> 00:45:10,395
swift in comparison to moving on foot. Drifting
over the top of the forest canopies, you guys,

693
00:45:10,395 --> 00:45:20,082
riding the top in this full-on, Falcor fly-through
moment as you're cruising through the snow-capped

694
00:45:20,082 --> 00:45:21,059
forest.

695
00:45:21,059 --> 00:45:21,940
TRAVIS: Like E.T.

696
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:22,979
LAURA: That's awesome.

697
00:45:22,979 --> 00:45:32,383
MATT: You can see a cluster of large eagles in the
distance. You guys manage to swoop around.

698
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:37,531
Eventually, as the sun begins to make its way
towards the horizon-- you managed to cut a good

699
00:45:37,531 --> 00:45:43,038
four or five hours off your journey on this,
making your way towards the Marrowglade Loch.

700
00:45:43,038 --> 00:45:52,518
There are certain areas where the canopy itself
breaks apart, and you can see ravines, you can see

701
00:45:52,518 --> 00:45:58,257
where areas of the topography have cracked or
shifted in time, and there are drops that go deep

702
00:45:58,257 --> 00:46:03,494
under the earth, though you cannot quite see where
they would continue to go, until you make your way

703
00:46:03,494 --> 00:46:08,955
to the Marrowglade, and there you can see, still
full to the top, if a little icy at the surface,

704
00:46:08,955 --> 00:46:16,999
it seems relatively undisturbed. You make your
way, all drifting down, back beneath the canopy of

705
00:46:16,999 --> 00:46:22,161
the Vesper Timberland, and at the edges of the
lake.

706
00:46:22,161 --> 00:46:28,714
MARY: Are there any islands in the loch? Are there
any islands or any sort of rocks or outcroppings,

707
00:46:28,714 --> 00:46:30,536
or anything within the loch itself?

708
00:46:30,536 --> 00:46:35,189
MATT: No, actually. It's a pretty solid surface,
and as you guys have drifted down in your form,

709
00:46:35,189 --> 00:46:39,414
looking at it, you can see that there is a layer
of ice. You're not quite sure how thick, but the

710
00:46:39,414 --> 00:46:40,914
surface is very crystalline.

711
00:46:40,914 --> 00:46:43,220
TALIESIN: Any remnants of ruins around the loch?

712
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:46,466
MATT: Make a perception check.

713
00:46:46,466 --> 00:46:53,134
LAURA: From above, could I see any sort of caverns
or openings in the ground, or something that

714
00:46:53,134 --> 00:46:56,254
looked like caves? That's what I was keeping my
eye out for as we went.

715
00:46:56,254 --> 00:46:58,603
MATT: Make a perception check for you, as well.

716
00:46:58,603 --> 00:47:00,201
TALIESIN: 25.

717
00:47:00,201 --> 00:47:09,964
MATT: 25. You see there are bits of stone
scattered about 30 feet out from the lake's edge.

718
00:47:09,964 --> 00:47:16,153
Going to inspect them, and looking about them,
there are pieces of fallen walls and what appear

719
00:47:16,153 --> 00:47:23,358
to be elements of the tomb, possibly before it
fell within, but you do not see any sort of

720
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:29,759
opening or entrance. It's just a part of some
structure, some foundation that was left behind.

721
00:47:29,759 --> 00:47:32,207
WILL: Are there any runes or any markings of any
kind?

722
00:47:32,207 --> 00:47:33,917
MATT: Make an investigation check.

723
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:35,547
LAURA: 22 is what I rolled.

724
00:47:35,547 --> 00:47:43,568
MATT: 22? Nothing near the loch. The largest chasm
or portion of land that you saw that was broken

725
00:47:43,568 --> 00:47:50,790
and receded into the earth itself was probably
about a half-mile to a mile back. Nothing that is

726
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:52,820
in the immediate vicinity of this lake.

727
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:56,467
LAURA: Okay. Is this technically-- are we in the
woods? Is this my favored terrain again?

728
00:47:56,467 --> 00:48:00,850
MATT: Yes. You guys have come down into the
forest. You're all still in mist form, so you're

729
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:03,753
unable to directly interact with anything in the
area.

730
00:48:03,753 --> 00:48:04,794
WILL: 11.

731
00:48:04,794 --> 00:48:08,649
MATT: 11? Doesn't seem to have any specific
elements or markings.

732
00:48:08,649 --> 00:48:15,353
MARY: Can I try, as well, because I can read any
writing that we find? May I make a check, as well?

733
00:48:15,353 --> 00:48:18,263
MATT: Make an investigation check. Sure.

734
00:48:18,263 --> 00:48:25,638
MARY: Oh, that's terrible. Never mind!

735
00:48:25,638 --> 00:48:29,874
MATT: So, you guys all rest around the outskirts
of this lake.

736
00:48:29,874 --> 00:48:34,761
LAURA: How do we stop being like this?

737
00:48:34,761 --> 00:48:40,012
MARISHA: Just think about it. Think about being a
person again.

738
00:48:40,012 --> 00:48:41,381
TRAVIS: How high are we?

739
00:48:41,381 --> 00:48:44,484
MATT: As high as you want to be. Right now,
everyone has come down to the edge of the lake, so

740
00:48:44,484 --> 00:48:45,759
you're right off the ground.

741
00:48:45,759 --> 00:48:47,309
LAURA: Should we turn like people again?

742
00:48:47,309 --> 00:48:48,800
MARISHA: Yeah, let's turn like people again.

743
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,942
LAURA: Tell Trinket to turn like a bear.

744
00:48:51,942 --> 00:48:54,522
WILL: Why is everyone talking like this?

745
00:48:54,522 --> 00:48:57,266
LAURA: Oh, can we talk normal? Oh.

746
00:48:57,266 --> 00:49:03,341
MARY: Trinket, hon. Just concentrate on turning
back into a bear, and you'll turn back into a bear.

747
00:49:03,341 --> 00:49:04,479
MATT: "Okay."

748
00:49:04,479 --> 00:49:06,022
LAURA: Tell him I love him.

749
00:49:06,022 --> 00:49:07,329
MARY: Oh! And Vex loves you.

750
00:49:07,329 --> 00:49:14,149
MATT: (laughs) If a bear could grin, it would.
However, the process is very strange as you see

751
00:49:14,149 --> 00:49:18,979
this misty cloud (poof) into a bear. It's about
a minute for the full transformation. The spell

752
00:49:18,979 --> 00:49:22,982
still maintains its eight-hour time period, and
you can transform back and forth during that

753
00:49:22,982 --> 00:49:24,012
eight-hour period.

754
00:49:24,012 --> 00:49:24,813
LAURA: Killer.

755
00:49:24,813 --> 00:49:27,786
MATT: So we'll say it's been about three to four
hours, so you're about half-duration. All of you

756
00:49:27,786 --> 00:49:32,042
eventually take a minute to revert back to your
physical forms, and you're all now standing at the

757
00:49:32,042 --> 00:49:33,223
edge of the lake.

758
00:49:33,223 --> 00:49:35,901
LIAM: So for the next eight hours, with a little
bit of concentration, we can jump back and forth?

759
00:49:35,901 --> 00:49:36,882
MATT: Next four hours.

760
00:49:36,882 --> 00:49:39,707
LIAM: Next four hours. We can spend a minute to go
(foomf) and (foomf)?

761
00:49:39,707 --> 00:49:43,140
MATT: Yep. You just can't do anything while you're
in that form, other than move.

762
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:44,612
LIAM: Yes, I remember.

763
00:49:44,612 --> 00:49:47,774
WILL: Can you move underwater?

764
00:49:47,774 --> 00:49:52,216
LAURA: (gasps) Can we mist underwater? Can farts
travel underwater?

765
00:49:52,216 --> 00:50:00,443
MARISHA: I guess if we get trapped underwater, we
could just concentrate and turn into bubbles.

766
00:50:00,443 --> 00:50:02,748
LAURA: That's kind of cool.

767
00:50:02,748 --> 00:50:04,840
MARISHA: Right? That would work, theoretically.

768
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,283
WILL: Or we'll all drown.

769
00:50:06,283 --> 00:50:07,743
LAURA: Or we'll drown.

770
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:09,652
MARY: It's a freshwater loch, right?

771
00:50:09,652 --> 00:50:13,053
TRAVIS: I don't know. I walk up to the edge of the
loch and I look in the water. What does the water

772
00:50:13,053 --> 00:50:14,096
look like?

773
00:50:14,096 --> 00:50:15,541
LAURA and LIAM: It's ice.

774
00:50:15,541 --> 00:50:20,175
MATT: So your head goes (boosh). A little crack.
(cracking noise)

775
00:50:20,175 --> 00:50:21,409
TRAVIS: It's ice!

776
00:50:21,409 --> 00:50:26,480
MATT: As he says that, you see a trickle of
crimson streaking down the front of his head.

777
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,091
LAURA: Thank you, Grog.

778
00:50:28,091 --> 00:50:29,085
TRAVIS: Welcome!

779
00:50:29,085 --> 00:50:32,462
TALIESIN: I'm going to put some pressure on the
ice with my foot. Is it giving, or is it not giving?

780
00:50:32,462 --> 00:50:35,346
MATT: At the place where he put his head, or any
other place?

781
00:50:35,346 --> 00:50:37,409
TALIESIN: No, I'm walking. I'm just testing the
ice.

782
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:42,778
MATT: Okay. Testing it with your foot on the edge,
it doesn't seem to be any give. Looking up close,

783
00:50:42,778 --> 00:50:45,529
you can see it's probably a good inch and a half
of ice.

784
00:50:45,529 --> 00:50:50,599
LAURA: Can I go hit the place where Grog hit his
head and see if I can crack a hole in the ice?

785
00:50:50,599 --> 00:50:56,920
MATT: Yeah. It takes you a few minutes, but you
manage to break apart and make a head-sized hole.

786
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,232
LIAM: And how thick is it, based on what she just
did?

787
00:50:59,232 --> 00:51:00,979
MATT: It's about an inch.

788
00:51:00,979 --> 00:51:02,419
LIAM: Oh, just an inch. Ooh.

789
00:51:02,419 --> 00:51:05,721
LAURA: This is going to suck! And I put my head
underwater to see if I can look around.

790
00:51:05,721 --> 00:51:07,632
MATT: Make a perception check with disadvantage.

791
00:51:07,632 --> 00:51:12,309
LAURA: Oh, shit!

792
00:51:12,309 --> 00:51:13,903
MARY: It's good, though!

793
00:51:13,903 --> 00:51:18,212
LAURA: Oh, with disadvantage. Doesn't it count as
disadvantage by destroying the rest of my dice?

794
00:51:18,212 --> 00:51:19,841
LIAM: Yeah!

795
00:51:19,841 --> 00:51:24,660
LAURA: Perception. That is a 31? No, 41.

796
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:27,111
LIAM: No, 71.

797
00:51:27,111 --> 00:51:35,797
MATT: You see through reality!

798
00:51:35,797 --> 00:51:37,493
LAURA: Yeah, 31.

799
00:51:37,493 --> 00:51:40,070
MATT: Giant floating baby right outside of the
planet, in space.

800
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:41,412
LAURA: What?!

801
00:51:41,412 --> 00:51:49,375
MATT: All right, so. Glancing through the murky
water beneath the ice's surface, it is dark, and

802
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:52,695
what little bit of light that would be hitting the
surface is refracting through the ice, so it's

803
00:51:52,695 --> 00:51:59,699
very hard to get a form. You can see there's a
very thick layer of bottom-of-the-lake

804
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:07,155
undergrowth: various underwater plants that have
caked the entire floor area of the lake. However,

805
00:52:07,155 --> 00:52:12,858
you can just see, at the edge of your vision
before the rest of the light is swallowed by the

806
00:52:12,858 --> 00:52:17,106
water and the murkiness of the depths, you can see
what looks to be the edge of some sort of stone

807
00:52:17,106 --> 00:52:24,886
structure, where two walls would be joined, but
they break off and crumble and disappear into more

808
00:52:24,886 --> 00:52:26,522
of the undergrowth.

809
00:52:26,522 --> 00:52:32,996
LAURA: (gasps, coughs) It's down there. Oh, it's
so cold!

810
00:52:32,996 --> 00:52:37,291
LIAM: I take her braid and I start wringing it
out.

811
00:52:37,291 --> 00:52:39,684
LAURA: My poor little feathers are like, poo.

812
00:52:39,684 --> 00:52:47,645
MARY: Can I use my staff to cast Light and shove
it down in to see if we can get any light out of

813
00:52:47,645 --> 00:52:50,064
it, beneath the ice?

814
00:52:50,064 --> 00:52:54,230
MATT: Sure. You cast Light at the end of your
staff. It glows and illuminates and as you shove

815
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:57,015
it down, the light disperses beneath the ice.

816
00:52:57,015 --> 00:53:03,712
TALIESIN: I'm going to take my mask and put it on,
and use the glass to create a clear view into the water.

817
00:53:03,712 --> 00:53:05,392
MARY: Should give you some light, Percy.

818
00:53:05,392 --> 00:53:06,566
TALIESIN: Thank you.

819
00:53:06,566 --> 00:53:10,145
MATT: Okay, so having to close one eye separately,
as the light source is literally right in your

820
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:18,422
face, you do look past, using the air trapped in
the mask. A little bit of water is peeking in

821
00:53:18,422 --> 00:53:23,034
because it's not perfect. You do manage to see
beyond that yes, there is indeed an element. It

822
00:53:23,034 --> 00:53:29,398
looks almost like a slightly tilted peak of some
sort of structure that comes to a point, and the

823
00:53:29,398 --> 00:53:34,151
top of the point is broken off and crumbled, and
there are a couple of sections of stone that seem

824
00:53:34,151 --> 00:53:38,785
to offshoot at four different points towards the
very bottom of the lake itself.

825
00:53:38,785 --> 00:53:41,971
LAURA: How deep does it look?

826
00:53:41,971 --> 00:53:45,524
MATT: I'd say it's about 50 to 60 feet deep.

827
00:53:45,524 --> 00:53:47,032
TALIESIN: 50 to 60 feet deep.

828
00:53:47,032 --> 00:53:48,932
LAURA: Oh. Good, good.

829
00:53:48,932 --> 00:53:50,558
TALIESIN: Give or take.

830
00:53:50,558 --> 00:53:54,979
LIAM: Do you want to try to cloud-creep our way in
there?

831
00:53:54,979 --> 00:53:57,378
MARISHA: How far away is it under the ice?

832
00:53:57,378 --> 00:54:01,092
TALIESIN: About 30 to 50 feet.

833
00:54:01,092 --> 00:54:04,685
MARISHA: Let's stand over top of where it is.

834
00:54:04,685 --> 00:54:09,671
LAURA: Is there any way-- because I have this
horrible feeling that we're going to get

835
00:54:09,671 --> 00:54:14,673
underwater, and then we won't be able to get out
because it's covered in ice. Can we melt the ice?

836
00:54:14,673 --> 00:54:15,878
Can you do something?

837
00:54:15,878 --> 00:54:19,048
MARISHA: I was about to do that, yeah, but I want
to go over-- Right above it.

838
00:54:19,048 --> 00:54:20,913
TALIESIN: Oh, that's a perfect idea.

839
00:54:20,913 --> 00:54:21,991
MARISHA: Yeah, so.

840
00:54:21,991 --> 00:54:23,297
LAURA: Walk carefully.

841
00:54:23,297 --> 00:54:24,950
TRAVIS: Are we all going in?

842
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:26,702
LAURA: I feel like we should.

843
00:54:26,702 --> 00:54:28,501
SAM: This is the same day as the monk fight?

844
00:54:28,501 --> 00:54:30,422
MATT: Yep.

845
00:54:30,422 --> 00:54:32,875
LAURA: We didn't rest?! We're idiots.

846
00:54:32,875 --> 00:54:35,445
TRAVIS: But we were going to camp when we got
here, right?

847
00:54:35,445 --> 00:54:38,185
MATT: It's about dusk now, if you guys are
landing.

848
00:54:38,185 --> 00:54:39,612
LAURA: Let's camp-- oh, god.

849
00:54:39,612 --> 00:54:41,509
MARY: So we're going to take a rest. What if I--

850
00:54:41,509 --> 00:54:45,302
TALIESIN: We can at least start setting up in the
meantime.

851
00:54:45,302 --> 00:54:48,796
MARY: So if we rest, will it be a long rest?
Overnight?

852
00:54:48,796 --> 00:54:51,176
LIAM: Yeah, we're going to camp for the night. I
don't think we should--

853
00:54:51,176 --> 00:54:54,824
SAM: But our mist form will dissipate, so if we
want to mist it, we should mist it now and check

854
00:54:54,824 --> 00:54:55,974
it out.

855
00:54:55,974 --> 00:55:02,420
LAURA: I'm going to try to mist down and just see
if I can.

856
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:04,769
LIAM: I'm going with her.

857
00:55:04,769 --> 00:55:08,514
MARISHA: I have Water Breathing. We could do that,
too.

858
00:55:08,514 --> 00:55:10,481
MARY: Or we could Polymorph and do something.

859
00:55:10,481 --> 00:55:13,361
LIAM: Well, let's just use the magic you already
expended first.

860
00:55:13,361 --> 00:55:15,012
MATT: You pull out your brand new hammer.

861
00:55:15,012 --> 00:55:16,675
TRAVIS: Yeah, the Moon Hammer!

862
00:55:16,675 --> 00:55:22,511
MATT: (doosh, doosh) Ice shards flying off,
splashing in the water. You're covered in this

863
00:55:22,511 --> 00:55:23,840
ice-cold water now.

864
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:26,939
LAURA: I'm concentrating on making myself a fart.

865
00:55:26,939 --> 00:55:30,999
MATT: Vex turns into a large, gaseous form.

866
00:55:30,999 --> 00:55:32,194
LAURA: He's doing it, too.

867
00:55:32,194 --> 00:55:33,672
MATT: Okay, the two twins, (foomf) together.

868
00:55:33,672 --> 00:55:35,812
LIAM: Twin farts.

869
00:55:35,812 --> 00:55:43,339
MARY: I'd also like to use Sculptor of Flesh and
Polymorph myself into a very large alligator.

870
00:55:43,339 --> 00:55:44,887
MATT: All right.

871
00:55:44,887 --> 00:55:46,610
MARY: And go down and check it out.

872
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:51,169
MATT: All right. You guys, all three of you,
descend into the open portion of the lake that

873
00:55:51,169 --> 00:55:52,474
Grog has broken through.

874
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:54,068
LAURA: Can we go in as gas?

875
00:55:54,068 --> 00:55:55,245
LIAM: Can we breathe?

876
00:55:55,245 --> 00:56:01,142
MATT: You guys do. It's a slog, and you can move
slowly, but the speed that's normally granted to

877
00:56:01,142 --> 00:56:04,717
you by this-- you actually move slower in this
form underwater than you would normally, swimming,

878
00:56:04,717 --> 00:56:11,969
and as you submerge yourselves, you realize, even
in this form, air is required, and you start

879
00:56:11,969 --> 00:56:13,651
(straining noises).

880
00:56:13,651 --> 00:56:15,795
LAURA: I go back up.

881
00:56:15,795 --> 00:56:21,059
MATT: The forms-- it's almost like mist appearing
on the edge of the lake that (fwoosh) forms up

882
00:56:21,059 --> 00:56:22,251
into your two different forms.

883
00:56:22,251 --> 00:56:23,332
MARISHA: So pretty.

884
00:56:23,332 --> 00:56:26,225
MATT: You, however, still delve down as your
alligator, and you swim your way down across the

885
00:56:26,225 --> 00:56:27,426
bottom of the lake.

886
00:56:27,426 --> 00:56:29,596
LIAM: Percy, we did some science! That didn't
work.

887
00:56:29,596 --> 00:56:35,170
TALIESIN: Congratulations. That's good to know.

888
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:39,651
MARISHA: All right, if we rest, I can learn Water
Breathing.

889
00:56:39,651 --> 00:56:41,332
LAURA: Oh, killer.

890
00:56:41,332 --> 00:56:43,853
SAM: Our good old Zahra is already down there
looking.

891
00:56:43,853 --> 00:56:47,696
LAURA: Let's try to set up camp in the trees, so
we're not on the ground.

892
00:56:47,696 --> 00:56:49,208
TRAVIS: Yeah, like in Whitestone.

893
00:56:49,208 --> 00:56:54,196
WILL: As they're setting up camp, Kash doesn't
leave the side of the lake. He's just watching for

894
00:56:54,196 --> 00:56:56,605
where Z went in. He's just staring the whole
time.

895
00:56:56,605 --> 00:56:59,311
MATT: All right, so as you guys are setting up
camp in a similar way that you did in Whitestone,

896
00:56:59,311 --> 00:57:03,448
up within the actual tree canopy itself, I need
you to make an investigation check.

897
00:57:03,448 --> 00:57:05,408
LAURA: Any sign of her, Kash?

898
00:57:05,408 --> 00:57:06,792
WILL: Nothing yet.

899
00:57:06,792 --> 00:57:10,410
MARY: Oh, natural 20.

900
00:57:10,410 --> 00:57:13,078
(cheering)

901
00:57:13,078 --> 00:57:18,007
LAURA: Oh! Natural 20.

902
00:57:18,007 --> 00:57:27,442
MATT: As you check around the ruins, looking
about, you can see there appears to be two

903
00:57:27,442 --> 00:57:36,426
different entrances that are both completely caved
in. What you do see, though, is there's an area of

904
00:57:36,426 --> 00:57:44,313
the bottom of the lake, about ten feet away from
one of the edges of the temple itself, that there

905
00:57:44,313 --> 00:57:53,652
is no undergrowth. There's the muddy floor, but it
appears as if there is no actual plant life that

906
00:57:53,652 --> 00:57:56,249
has grown in this ten-foot-circle area.

907
00:57:56,249 --> 00:57:59,564
MARY: Can I investigate that area?

908
00:57:59,564 --> 00:58:02,012
MATT: It's mud.

909
00:58:02,012 --> 00:58:11,404
MARY: It's just mud. All right. Can I get down
with my fabulous snout and dig down into the mud a

910
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:12,456
little bit?

911
00:58:12,456 --> 00:58:17,527
MATT: Okay. You take your snout and dig through
the mud and bring up some clouds of dirt and

912
00:58:17,527 --> 00:58:23,909
whatever scum has congealed at the bottom of this
pond. It murks up the water around you. Your

913
00:58:23,909 --> 00:58:30,358
vision is obscured. Doesn't seem to be revealing
anything, per se.

914
00:58:30,358 --> 00:58:32,080
MARY: But I do see an entrance?

915
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:39,645
MATT: You see what would be an entrance to the
structure, but the stonework itself has collapsed

916
00:58:39,645 --> 00:58:41,224
in on itself.

917
00:58:41,224 --> 00:58:47,071
MARY: Can I see any writing? Any runes, any sign
of carvings on the rocks at all?

918
00:58:47,071 --> 00:58:51,188
MATT: Actually, no. It's pretty plain. The
exterior is pretty damn plain in presentation.

919
00:58:51,188 --> 00:59:01,847
What minor bits of design or grooves that were put
into the stone to give it a presentational bump

920
00:59:01,847 --> 00:59:09,824
have eroded over time, but beyond that, it seems
surprisingly plain.

921
00:59:09,824 --> 00:59:18,959
MARY: What the hell would cause no plant life? And
I can do no more investigating than just that?

922
00:59:18,959 --> 00:59:22,394
MATT: What else would you want to try and do?

923
00:59:22,394 --> 00:59:25,075
MARY: (laughing) I don't know.

924
00:59:25,075 --> 00:59:27,763
MATT: You are welcome to do whatever you want to
do while you're here.

925
00:59:27,763 --> 00:59:29,469
LAURA: Maybe Keyleth can find out something.

926
00:59:29,469 --> 00:59:32,485
MARY: All right, then I'll go back up to the
surface and report back what I saw.

927
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:34,433
MATT: All right.

928
00:59:34,433 --> 00:59:36,706
WILL: Right when she gets out, he throws his cloak
over her.

929
00:59:36,706 --> 00:59:41,512
MARY: And I transform back into myself and whack
him on the butt as a thanks.

930
00:59:41,512 --> 00:59:42,860
LAURA: With your tail?

931
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:44,137
MARY: With my tail.

932
00:59:44,137 --> 00:59:46,209
TALIESIN: That's what tails are for.

933
00:59:46,209 --> 00:59:50,572
MATT: You guys return, and you relay what you
found to the rest of the group as you guys are

934
00:59:50,572 --> 00:59:55,375
preparing yourselves. At this point, the sun has
set, and the night itself is going from red to

935
00:59:55,375 --> 01:00:02,088
dark purple to a proper evening sky. Anything else
you wish to prepare for the evening before you all

936
01:00:02,088 --> 01:00:03,669
find yourselves resting?

937
01:00:03,669 --> 01:00:05,427
LIAM: Yeah. Sit on the ground. Your hair's a
mess.

938
01:00:05,427 --> 01:00:09,901
I undo the braid and I just -- starting
over.

939
01:00:09,901 --> 01:00:11,132
LAURA: (yelps)

940
01:00:11,132 --> 01:00:12,479
LIAM: Hold still.

941
01:00:12,479 --> 01:00:14,319
MATT: All right. Anyone else?

942
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:18,192
MARY: Can I go speak to Keyleth about what I saw?

943
01:00:18,192 --> 01:00:19,138
MATT: Yeah.

944
01:00:19,138 --> 01:00:25,799
MARY: Keyleth, I saw something strange down there.
I told everyone before, but I just don't know what

945
01:00:25,799 --> 01:00:31,092
it is, and I'm not quite sure how to go about
finding out what's inside there. There's no plant

946
01:00:31,092 --> 01:00:37,365
life whatsoever, and you have a connection, do you
not, to plants, to trees? A much stronger one than

947
01:00:37,365 --> 01:00:39,819
I certainly do, I would imagine.

948
01:00:39,819 --> 01:00:44,209
MARISHA: I do. I could attempt to see what
happened. What do you mean, there was no plant life?

949
01:00:44,209 --> 01:00:49,792
MARY: Well, I went down. There were two entrances,
and obviously they had crumbled and were no longer

950
01:00:49,792 --> 01:00:56,299
accessible, and it seemed like there was one more,
but around it-- there was pretty substantial plant

951
01:00:56,299 --> 01:01:01,138
life all around, coming out from the ground, but
in about a ten-foot area, there was nothing there.

952
01:01:01,138 --> 01:01:06,629
And I tried to get down in with my snout, but all
I did was kick up more silt, and I couldn't really

953
01:01:06,629 --> 01:01:08,276
see anything.

954
01:01:08,276 --> 01:01:10,884
MARISHA: Strange. This was at the bottom of the
ocean floor?

955
01:01:10,884 --> 01:01:12,585
MARY: Of the loch, yes.

956
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:14,185
LAURA and MARY: The loch.

957
01:01:14,185 --> 01:01:22,072
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check to see if that
sounds like anything familiar and could be a

958
01:01:22,072 --> 01:01:23,270
problem?

959
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:25,023
MATT: Sure, go ahead and make a nature check.

960
01:01:25,023 --> 01:01:30,456
LAURA: Did it seem like a perfect circle, Zahra,
or was it jaggedy?

961
01:01:30,456 --> 01:01:38,774
MATT: It wasn't mathematically perfect, but it was
noticeable to be a section of the lake floor that

962
01:01:38,774 --> 01:01:41,430
was glaring to be missing in a large patch.

963
01:01:41,430 --> 01:01:45,096
LAURA: How soft was the ground when you dug into
it? It was softer than the rest of the ground?

964
01:01:45,096 --> 01:01:46,338
MATT: It was very soft.

965
01:01:46,338 --> 01:01:50,732
MARY: I just stuck my snout in it, and it kicked
up all the mud, and I couldn't see anything after that.

966
01:01:50,732 --> 01:01:52,590
LAURA: Sounds to me like a creature that would
burrow.

967
01:01:52,590 --> 01:01:54,309
MARISHA: It's possible. 18.

968
01:01:54,309 --> 01:02:03,276
MATT: 18? From what you understand, the reasons
for something to not grow on the bottom of the

969
01:02:03,276 --> 01:02:11,201
lake would mean that the dirt and the surrounding
earth would have to be disturbed enough to where

970
01:02:11,201 --> 01:02:12,635
nothing could take root.

971
01:02:12,635 --> 01:02:14,597
WILL: It's a lair.

972
01:02:14,597 --> 01:02:17,977
LAURA: Do I know of any creatures that are
underwater--

973
01:02:17,977 --> 01:02:21,299
MARISHA: That burrow? Giant worms?

974
01:02:21,299 --> 01:02:25,208
LAURA: Is it like the worms that we encountered
before?

975
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:31,009
MATT: From what you know and have researched about
the worm you discovered previously, they tend to

976
01:02:31,009 --> 01:02:37,043
favor more rocky, mountainous terrain than
underwater. There are many creatures that can burrow.

977
01:02:37,043 --> 01:02:39,602
MARISHA: Are there any underwater serpents?

978
01:02:39,602 --> 01:02:44,129
MATT: Plenty of underwater serpents. There's all
sorts of manner of creatures in this world.

979
01:02:44,129 --> 01:02:48,042
LAURA: It's possible it's a creature that's
burrowing, or it's possible that's an opening into

980
01:02:48,042 --> 01:02:50,206
our underwater cavern, and nothing can grow
there.

981
01:02:50,206 --> 01:02:52,271
MARISHA: It could be a sinkhole. It could lead
to--

982
01:02:52,271 --> 01:02:53,553
WILL: Could be a chimney.

983
01:02:53,553 --> 01:02:57,315
MARISHA: Unlikely, but it could be a chimney.

984
01:02:57,315 --> 01:03:04,157
MARY: Working for the Slayer's Take, and having
done research on the animals that we have

985
01:03:04,157 --> 01:03:13,850
destroyed for money, would there be anything that
we would know about serpents, or another creature

986
01:03:13,850 --> 01:03:17,237
that might inhabit this loch?

987
01:03:17,237 --> 01:03:24,843
MATT: Serpents in lakes? Nothing that would be
monumental beyond actual water serpents, which are

988
01:03:24,843 --> 01:03:29,798
minor inconveniences and just natural creatures.
Anything of this size, per se-- there are all

989
01:03:29,798 --> 01:03:35,779
sorts of entities that it could be, but none that
would be specific to a lake location, necessarily.

990
01:03:35,779 --> 01:03:39,527
Whether it be a subterranean creature that uses it
for passage, or if there's something that lives in

991
01:03:39,527 --> 01:03:47,863
the lake, or is part of the lake, living in the
water itself, nothing comes to mind, from your

992
01:03:47,863 --> 01:03:48,805
experience.

993
01:03:48,805 --> 01:03:49,973
MARISHA: What time is it?

994
01:03:49,973 --> 01:03:53,202
MATT: It's past sunset. It's now in proper night.

995
01:03:53,202 --> 01:03:55,443
MARISHA: Let me go take a look, real quick.

996
01:03:55,443 --> 01:03:59,334
LAURA: You're going underwater now? It's freezing
cold!

997
01:03:59,334 --> 01:04:00,885
TRAVIS: We're all going in there, anyway.

998
01:04:00,885 --> 01:04:07,486
MARISHA: I can do my beast thing. I'll be fine. I
jump in and go shark form.

999
01:04:07,486 --> 01:04:10,054
LIAM: I go to the edge of the loch and watch.

1000
01:04:10,054 --> 01:04:11,448
WILL: So do I.

1001
01:04:11,448 --> 01:04:16,363
MATT: Okay, so the two of you are waiting at the
edge of the loch? Keyleth jumps off the edge, and

1002
01:04:16,363 --> 01:04:21,554
in midair, forms into this giant shark form that
slams into the surface of the cold water through

1003
01:04:21,554 --> 01:04:23,576
the opening that Grog had already opened.

1004
01:04:23,576 --> 01:04:26,901
LAURA: She's really attractive now, isn't she?
That shark.

1005
01:04:26,901 --> 01:04:29,353
LIAM: I'm with Kash, man. What?

1006
01:04:29,353 --> 01:04:30,395
LAURA: Huh?

1007
01:04:30,395 --> 01:04:32,337
(laughter)

1008
01:04:32,337 --> 01:04:35,276
MATT: All right. Make an investigation check.

1009
01:04:35,276 --> 01:04:38,714
MARISHA: I can't do nature, or anything like
that?

1010
01:04:38,714 --> 01:04:41,003
MATT: Are you inspecting the ruin? What do you
want to do?

1011
01:04:41,003 --> 01:04:48,431
MARISHA: Can I see if the hole is natural-made, or
man-made?

1012
01:04:48,431 --> 01:04:49,745
MATT: Investigation check.

1013
01:04:49,745 --> 01:04:51,114
MARISHA: Damn it.

1014
01:04:51,114 --> 01:04:54,018
MATT: There's a difference between your knowledge
of nature vs. actually having to investigate a

1015
01:04:54,018 --> 01:04:55,404
specific detail.

1016
01:04:55,404 --> 01:04:56,407
MARISHA: 14?

1017
01:04:56,407 --> 01:05:02,044
MATT: 14. If you're looking at the area that she
was mentioning, where the plant life is missing,

1018
01:05:02,044 --> 01:05:08,473
it doesn't appear to be man-made, by any means. It
just looks to have formed by some perpetual

1019
01:05:08,473 --> 01:05:13,414
disturbance of the muddy earth in that vicinity.

1020
01:05:13,414 --> 01:05:14,885
LAURA: Sounds like a creature.

1021
01:05:14,885 --> 01:05:18,421
MATT: Anything else you want to investigate while
you're down there?

1022
01:05:18,421 --> 01:05:25,186
MARISHA: Does there appear to be any type of
motion, or does it look like it's going downward,

1023
01:05:25,186 --> 01:05:26,599
or is it just flat?

1024
01:05:26,599 --> 01:05:30,596
MATT: It has some variation to it, and there's a
portion that appears to have been dug up, or at

1025
01:05:30,596 --> 01:05:32,742
least, there is a slight indentation.

1026
01:05:32,742 --> 01:05:37,137
MARISHA: Let me do a quick lap around the ruins
and see if I see anything that jumps out at me.

1027
01:05:37,137 --> 01:05:39,586
MATT: Okay. Make another investigation check about
the ruins, specifically.

1028
01:05:39,586 --> 01:05:42,298
MARISHA: Oy. 11.

1029
01:05:42,298 --> 01:05:48,005
MATT: 11. Looking about, same details that she
made out about it. You do see there is one other

1030
01:05:48,005 --> 01:05:53,760
stone entrance of the partially tilted stone
structure. Looks almost like there was a double

1031
01:05:53,760 --> 01:06:00,391
doorway there, at one side of it, but a series of
stones and a portion of the structure have

1032
01:06:00,391 --> 01:06:02,897
crumbled in on it, and it has blocked the
passage.

1033
01:06:02,897 --> 01:06:11,984
MARISHA: Does it look to be a similar downward
suction thing going on like the other hole?

1034
01:06:11,984 --> 01:06:13,362
(laughter)

1035
01:06:13,362 --> 01:06:18,153
MATT: Looks like a partially collapsed, or
completely collapsed entrance to this structure.

1036
01:06:18,153 --> 01:06:19,484
MARISHA: Okay.

1037
01:06:19,484 --> 01:06:21,321
WILL: "Downward suction thing."

1038
01:06:21,321 --> 01:06:23,332
(laughter)

1039
01:06:23,332 --> 01:06:25,627
MARISHA: That's the scientific term.

1040
01:06:25,627 --> 01:06:28,366
MATT: CSI: Vasselheim.

1041
01:06:28,366 --> 01:06:30,249
(laughter)

1042
01:06:30,249 --> 01:06:31,700
MARISHA: I bounce out.

1043
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:37,465
MATT: Okay. The shark (boosh) out of the water,
catches you off for a second, almost Jaws-ride style.

1044
01:06:37,465 --> 01:06:40,773
MARISHA: Three point landing. Hi, guys.

1045
01:06:40,773 --> 01:06:41,815
LIAM: Fin, fin.

1046
01:06:41,815 --> 01:06:43,465
MARISHA: Yeah, fin, fin. Land shark.

1047
01:06:43,465 --> 01:06:49,377
MATT: There you go. Keyleth reverts to her normal
form.

1048
01:06:49,377 --> 01:06:57,990
MARISHA: I'm with Zahra. Seems like something
scary is probably burrowing down there. We'll

1049
01:06:57,990 --> 01:07:00,275
probably just have to avoid it tomorrow.

1050
01:07:00,275 --> 01:07:05,469
MARY: There are no other entrances. That could be
the entrance.

1051
01:07:05,469 --> 01:07:08,147
TALIESIN: We can unblock some of the blocked
entrances. That's what we're going to have to do,

1052
01:07:08,147 --> 01:07:09,870
is unblock the blocked entrance.

1053
01:07:09,870 --> 01:07:12,174
LIAM: It's going to be a big day tomorrow. We
should probably get some sleep.

1054
01:07:12,174 --> 01:07:17,774
MARY: When I went around the ruins, did I notice
how large the stones were that had fallen in for

1055
01:07:17,774 --> 01:07:19,373
the blocked entrance?

1056
01:07:19,373 --> 01:07:24,016
MATT: They varied in size, because it was part of
the wall that had fallen in on itself, so there

1057
01:07:24,016 --> 01:07:28,058
are sections that are three, three and a half feet
in diameter, and there are also a number of

1058
01:07:28,058 --> 01:07:36,100
smaller, head-sized rocks and chunks that had all
filled in this space. A lot of the general soot

1059
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:42,625
and mud that had gathered as part of the lake's
creation had filled in and covered elements of it

1060
01:07:42,625 --> 01:07:47,429
and seeped in to form this pucker-point, if you
will.

1061
01:07:47,429 --> 01:07:48,886
LAURA: (laughs) Pucker point.

1062
01:07:48,886 --> 01:07:50,885
TALIESIN: It's getting weird tonight.

1063
01:07:50,885 --> 01:07:54,452
MARY: It's an anus of the loch. The loch has an
anus.

1064
01:07:54,452 --> 01:07:58,107
LAURA: We should settle down to sleep.

1065
01:07:58,107 --> 01:08:00,704
LIAM: (Scottish accent) Oh, you're going to Loch
Anus, are you?

1066
01:08:00,704 --> 01:08:08,209
MARY: (Scottish accent) I love Loch Anus! It's
very muddy. Very muddy. Well, it is! I put my nose in it.

1067
01:08:08,209 --> 01:08:10,641
(all make sounds of dismay)

1068
01:08:10,641 --> 01:08:13,301
MARY: I did, as a crocodile.

1069
01:08:13,301 --> 01:08:16,425
MATT: Why are you making it weird?

1070
01:08:16,425 --> 01:08:18,269
(laughter)

1071
01:08:18,269 --> 01:08:22,498
LAURA: As we're settling down to sleep, I make
sure that Trinket is laying between Kash and

1072
01:08:22,498 --> 01:08:25,020
Keyleth, always.

1073
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:27,189
MATT: All right.

1074
01:08:27,189 --> 01:08:30,380
MARISHA: I just snuggle up with Trinket. Hey,
bud.

1075
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:33,600
LAURA: Yeah. Trinket, keep Keyleth warm. She's
cold. She was in the water.

1076
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,356
MATT: All right.

1077
01:08:35,356 --> 01:08:36,966
WILL: He's a big bear.

1078
01:08:36,966 --> 01:08:41,842
MATT: He's a very big bear, and the moment that
you glance over and give a look. Without even

1079
01:08:41,842 --> 01:08:44,331
looking at you, you just hear this, (growls).

1080
01:08:44,331 --> 01:08:45,897
WILL: Okay, fair enough.

1081
01:08:45,897 --> 01:08:50,128
MATT: All right. Anything else you wish to prepare
for the evening?

1082
01:08:50,128 --> 01:08:51,406
TALIESIN: I'm good.

1083
01:08:51,406 --> 01:08:54,320
MATT: All right. You all find yourselves asleep--

1084
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:57,204
ALL: Wait, wait, wait!

1085
01:08:57,204 --> 01:08:58,532
LIAM: I'll take first watch.

1086
01:08:58,532 --> 01:09:00,268
(laughter)

1087
01:09:00,268 --> 01:09:01,277
WILL: Who's watching?

1088
01:09:01,277 --> 01:09:02,702
LIAM: What are you doing, man?

1089
01:09:02,702 --> 01:09:04,388
MARY: Then they all died in their sleep.

1090
01:09:04,388 --> 01:09:07,942
LAURA: You need to rest. You got beat up.

1091
01:09:07,942 --> 01:09:10,670
LIAM: We take fucking turns.

1092
01:09:10,670 --> 01:09:13,323
LAURA: You go to sleep. I'm going to stay up for a
little bit because I'm fine.

1093
01:09:13,323 --> 01:09:14,739
MARY: I'll stay up with Vex.

1094
01:09:14,739 --> 01:09:15,910
LIAM: All right.

1095
01:09:15,910 --> 01:09:17,532
TALIESIN: Wake me up when you're done with your
shift.

1096
01:09:17,532 --> 01:09:18,992
MARISHA: Yeah, wake me up whenever.

1097
01:09:18,992 --> 01:09:20,814
LAURA: We climb up in the tree and keep watch.

1098
01:09:20,814 --> 01:09:24,216
LIAM: I find the only empty spot of fur on Trinket
left and snuggle into it.

1099
01:09:24,216 --> 01:09:28,640
MATT: Okay. The whole process of getting Trinket
up into the tree itself is hilarious.

1100
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:29,725
LAURA: It's difficult.

1101
01:09:29,725 --> 01:09:39,253
MATT: It's a group effort, to a certain extent.
There's a difference between climbing a tree and

1102
01:09:39,253 --> 01:09:43,018
getting up into a tree and then getting into a
comfortable place where you can rest and not

1103
01:09:43,018 --> 01:09:51,148
destroy the tree. It's a combination of minor
druidic talents to create an element of the tree's

1104
01:09:51,148 --> 01:09:54,169
growth that would be able to support a weight the
size of a bear.

1105
01:09:54,169 --> 01:09:55,532
MARISHA: Yeah, I grow a basket.

1106
01:09:55,532 --> 01:09:57,026
MATT: Yeah. You've done it before.

1107
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:58,228
TALIESIN: A bear basket.

1108
01:09:58,228 --> 01:10:01,240
LAURA: Trinket's very thankful.

1109
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:06,105
MATT: All right, the two of you keep watch for the
first watch. We'll say for about a four-hour

1110
01:10:06,105 --> 01:10:15,421
period. Okay. As the end of your watch progresses,
I need you both to make a perception check.

1111
01:10:15,421 --> 01:10:16,600
LAURA: Oh, shit.

1112
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:17,722
MARY: Each of us?

1113
01:10:17,722 --> 01:10:20,390
MATT: The two that were taking watch. The twins.

1114
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:24,566
LAURA: He went to bed. I was awake.

1115
01:10:24,566 --> 01:10:25,830
MARY: We stayed up.

1116
01:10:25,830 --> 01:10:28,348
WILL: Because something's coming out of Loch
Anus.

1117
01:10:28,348 --> 01:10:34,007
SAM: A dark force is coming out of Loch Anus.

1118
01:10:34,007 --> 01:10:40,018
LAURA: It's okay, I'm good. 34.

1119
01:10:40,018 --> 01:10:43,467
MARY: Six.

1120
01:10:43,467 --> 01:10:51,045
MATT: Looking off towards the other side of the
lake, you see, under what little bit of moonlight

1121
01:10:51,045 --> 01:10:55,984
is peeking through the cloud cover over the area,
which breaks up every now and then. You can see a

1122
01:10:55,984 --> 01:10:59,282
few stars glistening, and a little of the moon
peeks through. Catches your attention,

1123
01:10:59,282 --> 01:11:05,353
specifically, as the moon is the essence of your
patron. Through your vision, you can see a handful

1124
01:11:05,353 --> 01:11:13,432
of small-- I say small. Small from this distance,
but relatively large, Trinket-sized furry entities

1125
01:11:13,432 --> 01:11:17,354
that cluster up to the edge of the lake on the
opposite side.

1126
01:11:17,354 --> 01:11:21,786
LAURA: Trinket-sized furry entities? I can't see
if they're actually bears.

1127
01:11:21,786 --> 01:11:24,261
MATT: Not at this distance, no.

1128
01:11:24,261 --> 01:11:29,334
LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace on everyone
around me, and I stealth.

1129
01:11:29,334 --> 01:11:31,420
We're already stealthed.

1130
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:34,612
TRAVIS: What's the circumference of the lake?

1131
01:11:34,612 --> 01:11:46,902
MATT: The full distance around it? I'd say 250 to
300 feet. It's not a huge lake.

1132
01:11:46,902 --> 01:11:48,926
TRAVIS: It's a giant pond.

1133
01:11:48,926 --> 01:11:50,838
WILL: So they're not that far away, then?

1134
01:11:50,838 --> 01:11:51,987
LAURA: 24.

1135
01:11:51,987 --> 01:11:55,803
MATT: They're about 50, 60 feet from you guys
right now.

1136
01:11:55,803 --> 01:11:59,407
MARY: I have darkvision. Can I see them?

1137
01:11:59,407 --> 01:12:01,090
MATT: Darkvision up to a certain distance.

1138
01:12:01,090 --> 01:12:02,410
MARY: 60 feet.

1139
01:12:02,410 --> 01:12:07,800
MATT: I'd say, best you can look at it, you've
encountered these in the past, and this appears to

1140
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:14,877
be a small group of evening-wandering owlbears
that are passing through the vicinity.

1141
01:12:14,877 --> 01:12:17,054
LAURA: Owlbears!

1142
01:12:17,054 --> 01:12:19,494
MARY: I can talk to them.

1143
01:12:19,494 --> 01:12:23,019
LIAM: Big, angry bastards.

1144
01:12:23,019 --> 01:12:25,726
SAM: Oh, well why didn't you just say so?

1145
01:12:25,726 --> 01:12:31,631
MATT: They do not appear to notice your presence,
and are just passing through.

1146
01:12:31,631 --> 01:12:33,050
LAURA: Let's just watch them.

1147
01:12:33,050 --> 01:12:34,273
MARY: What are they?

1148
01:12:34,273 --> 01:12:36,589
SAM: Throw things at them!

1149
01:12:36,589 --> 01:12:41,162
LAURA: We just sit and enjoy this magical moment
of seeing the rare owlbear in person.

1150
01:12:41,162 --> 01:12:42,992
MARISHA: (whispering) So majestic.

1151
01:12:42,992 --> 01:12:46,751
SAM: Quick! Start eating a Tootsie Pop.

1152
01:12:46,751 --> 01:12:48,757
MARY: One.

1153
01:12:48,757 --> 01:12:49,954
LAURA AND MARY: Two.

1154
01:12:49,954 --> 01:12:52,101
ALL: Three!

1155
01:12:52,101 --> 01:12:54,771
(laughter)

1156
01:12:54,771 --> 01:13:02,940
MATT: Mr. Owl's bad, but Mr. Turtle was a real
dick because he's the one who sent the kid to it,

1157
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:07,884
knowing full well the owl was going to eat that
treat. The true villain's Mr. Turtle.

1158
01:13:07,884 --> 01:13:11,680
WILL: What about the education of the kid, where
he's got to go to animals to learn things-- oh,

1159
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:13,220
forget it.

1160
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:17,210
LIAM: Half the audience is going, "yeah." And half
the audience is going,

1161
01:13:17,210 --> 01:13:19,440
"what the fuck are they talking about?"

1162
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:23,053
MATT: You get slightly nervous as the owlbears
make their way closer to your edge of the lake,

1163
01:13:23,053 --> 01:13:28,338
going to where the initial breaking of the ice was
set by Grog. They all drink of the ice-cold water,

1164
01:13:28,338 --> 01:13:32,977
and then eventually make their way scare on the
opposite side of the forest.

1165
01:13:32,977 --> 01:13:35,311
LAURA: Did they leave any feathers behind?

1166
01:13:35,311 --> 01:13:40,212
MATT: A couple, maybe?

1167
01:13:40,212 --> 01:13:44,880
LAURA: After they get away, I want to climb down
and gather the feathers that they left behind.

1168
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:46,344
MATT: You find two owlbear feathers.

1169
01:13:46,344 --> 01:13:47,545
LAURA: Okay!

1170
01:13:47,545 --> 01:13:49,413
MARY: We can put them in our hair.

1171
01:13:49,413 --> 01:13:53,817
LAURA: I want to fletch an arrow. Owlbear arrows.

1172
01:13:53,817 --> 01:13:58,072
MATT: Okay. What kits do you have with you?

1173
01:13:58,072 --> 01:14:05,468
LAURA: Oh, shit. Really? You know. Those ones I
have.

1174
01:14:05,539 --> 01:14:08,859
MATT: Make a dexterity check. Just a straight
dexterity check.

1175
01:14:08,859 --> 01:14:09,958
LAURA: Okay.

1176
01:14:09,958 --> 01:14:11,245
LIAM: Where did you get those thieves' tools?

1177
01:14:11,245 --> 01:14:12,553
LAURA: I have thieves' tools because I'm a thief
now.

1178
01:14:12,553 --> 01:14:13,917
LIAM: Where did you get them? Did you buy them?

1179
01:14:13,917 --> 01:14:15,196
LAURA: I stole them, dude.

1180
01:14:15,196 --> 01:14:18,581
LIAM: Stole them from where? When? I don't
remember that. Did that happen in-game, or did you

1181
01:14:18,581 --> 01:14:19,648
make that up?

1182
01:14:19,648 --> 01:14:27,795
LAURA: Matt told me I have thieves' tools! Dick.
27. 27 dexterity.

1183
01:14:27,795 --> 01:14:29,308
MATT: He is asleep. Talking in his sleep.

1184
01:14:29,308 --> 01:14:31,442
MARY: Voice in my head. Brother. Twin.

1185
01:14:31,442 --> 01:14:32,845
LAURA: Shut up!

1186
01:14:32,845 --> 01:14:41,124
MATT: You finish out the rest of your watch. Using
the moonlight at your disposal, you manage to make

1187
01:14:41,124 --> 01:14:43,550
a couple of owlbear arrows with the feathers you
found.

1188
01:14:43,550 --> 01:14:44,781
LAURA: These are special.

1189
01:14:44,781 --> 01:14:46,224
MATT: They're functional. They'll do.

1190
01:14:46,224 --> 01:14:47,370
LAURA: Cool.

1191
01:14:47,370 --> 01:14:48,603
TRAVIS: They're fucking feathers.

1192
01:14:48,603 --> 01:14:51,849
LAURA: Shut up. I'm writing, "two owlbear
arrows."

1193
01:14:51,849 --> 01:14:53,929
MATT: Next watch?

1194
01:14:53,929 --> 01:14:55,545
LIAM: Yeah.

1195
01:14:55,545 --> 01:14:56,628
TALIESIN: Hello.

1196
01:14:56,628 --> 01:15:03,525
MATT: All right. You guys go to sleep. The two of
you stay up. All right. You watch and the next

1197
01:15:03,525 --> 01:15:05,816
four hours go by, unhindered.

1198
01:15:05,816 --> 01:15:09,568
LAURA: Oh, I warn them there's owlbears in the
area before I go to sleep.

1199
01:15:09,568 --> 01:15:11,585
LIAM: Where? What the--

1200
01:15:11,585 --> 01:15:15,398
WILL: About three hours into their shift, can I
come and relieve him?

1201
01:15:15,398 --> 01:15:19,285
LIAM: Wait! I wanted to talk to him. You've got to
wait.

1202
01:15:19,285 --> 01:15:20,469
(laughter)

1203
01:15:20,469 --> 01:15:21,725
WILL: I'll wait. I'll wait.

1204
01:15:21,725 --> 01:15:23,451
LIAM: Percival.

1205
01:15:23,451 --> 01:15:24,337
TALIESIN: Yes?

1206
01:15:24,337 --> 01:15:33,444
LIAM: De Rolo. How are you doing? A lot's going
on. A lot. But it hasn't been that long.

1207
01:15:33,444 --> 01:15:43,568
TALIESIN: No, I'm pleased for the distraction,
honestly. I feel-- (sighs)

1208
01:15:43,568 --> 01:15:46,652
LIAM: Has Orthax fully left the building?

1209
01:15:46,652 --> 01:15:49,752
TALIESIN: I don't hear anything anymore, if that's
what you're asking.

1210
01:15:49,752 --> 01:15:51,319
LIAM: It is.

1211
01:15:51,319 --> 01:15:58,575
TALIESIN: I think-- I think all I'm manifesting at
this point is scars. Honestly, I feel a little

1212
01:15:58,575 --> 01:16:02,899
lost now. I'm really not entirely sure what I'm
doing with myself.

1213
01:16:02,899 --> 01:16:12,427
LIAM: Can I tell you, I believe you are a good
man.

1214
01:16:12,427 --> 01:16:14,563
TALIESIN: Thank you.

1215
01:16:14,563 --> 01:16:29,200
LIAM: If you listen to your better angels, and
they're within your friends. Listen to them. I

1216
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:34,134
don't want to be pushy. I'm sorry. But you have a
family, if you want it.

1217
01:16:34,134 --> 01:16:42,380
TALIESIN: I know. I've been thinking, a lot, about
why we're together and what we're doing.

1218
01:16:42,380 --> 01:16:44,551
LIAM: I think we all are, yeah.

1219
01:16:44,551 --> 01:16:55,590
TALIESIN: And the conclusion that I've been coming
to so far (sighs) and Pike being the exception to

1220
01:16:55,590 --> 01:17:04,978
this rule, as she's the exception to so many
things, is I think we're very broken people, but I

1221
01:17:04,978 --> 01:17:16,696
think together, we are far greater than the sum of
our parts. I like who we are together, and I think

1222
01:17:16,696 --> 01:17:18,553
that's important.

1223
01:17:18,553 --> 01:17:21,051
LIAM: I agree with that.

1224
01:17:21,051 --> 01:17:32,156
TALIESIN: And I like the influence that everyone
has on each other, and this includes, perhaps, you

1225
01:17:32,156 --> 01:17:40,617
taking some strides with yourself. (sighs)

1226
01:17:40,617 --> 01:17:44,335
LIAM: How do you mean?

1227
01:17:44,335 --> 01:17:49,970
TALIESIN: It's good to want things. It's very,
very good to want things. It's also very, very

1228
01:17:49,970 --> 01:18:00,831
good to have things. It's good to-- it's good to
find the things that are important to you and move

1229
01:18:00,831 --> 01:18:07,901
towards them. I'm in a place where I'm realizing
that I have to make decisions about what's

1230
01:18:07,901 --> 01:18:13,487
important, and I'm a little envious that you seem
to be ahead of the curve on that.

1231
01:18:13,487 --> 01:18:18,165
LIAM: I wish I felt that way.

1232
01:18:18,165 --> 01:18:20,089
TALIESIN: I know.

1233
01:18:20,089 --> 01:18:30,578
LIAM: Well. I started talking to you. I just-- I'm
sorry if I've done anything to offend you.

1234
01:18:30,578 --> 01:18:33,148
TALIESIN: Never.

1235
01:18:33,148 --> 01:18:37,717
LIAM: We're a bit of an awkward family, but we are
trying.

1236
01:18:37,717 --> 01:18:42,709
TALIESIN: And I apologize for any of the mistakes
I've made, and honestly any of the mistakes I'm

1237
01:18:42,709 --> 01:18:54,194
likely to make, but I am starting to imagine a
better version of myself. I'm not quite sure who

1238
01:18:54,194 --> 01:19:03,055
that is yet, but there is a destiny, I think, for
us all together.

1239
01:19:03,055 --> 01:19:09,129
LIAM: This is all a lot bigger than us
individually now.

1240
01:19:09,129 --> 01:19:17,914
TALIESIN: We've been given mighty deeds to
accomplish. We will rise. Or if we fail, no one

1241
01:19:17,914 --> 01:19:19,736
will ever know. (chuckles)

1242
01:19:19,736 --> 01:19:28,684
LIAM: (laughs) There's comfort in that. All right.
I've said my piece.

1243
01:19:28,684 --> 01:19:32,647
MATT: At which point, you hear a voice say, "Good.
I'm trying to sleep."

1244
01:19:32,647 --> 01:19:35,521
(laughter)

1245
01:19:35,521 --> 01:19:39,980
MATT: The clinking of armor as Kima rolls over on
one of the branches and is face-palming at the

1246
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:41,322
conversation.

1247
01:19:41,322 --> 01:19:45,491
LIAM: You are really fucking cool. You know that,
don't you?

1248
01:19:45,491 --> 01:19:53,512
MATT: At this point, you hear a distant screech
that echoes across the night sky. All of you wake

1249
01:19:53,512 --> 01:19:58,275
up. While not extremely loud, it is very
noticeable and cuts through the silence, as there

1250
01:19:58,275 --> 01:20:00,223
is a very still wind tonight.

1251
01:20:00,223 --> 01:20:01,706
LIAM: Even if my sister's waking up, I kick her
hard in the ass.

1252
01:20:01,706 --> 01:20:03,767
LAURA: Ah! Fuck you!

1253
01:20:03,767 --> 01:20:06,204
MATT: You two, make a perception check.

1254
01:20:06,204 --> 01:20:08,809
SAM: Have we achieved our long rest yet?

1255
01:20:08,809 --> 01:20:09,853
MATT: Not yet, no.

1256
01:20:09,853 --> 01:20:12,196
LIAM: 22.

1257
01:20:12,196 --> 01:20:14,112
TALIESIN: 17.

1258
01:20:14,112 --> 01:20:15,110
MATT: Okay.

1259
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:16,700
LAURA: I have Pass Without a Trace cast on us--

1260
01:20:16,700 --> 01:20:18,275
MATT: As you went to sleep, you didn't.

1261
01:20:18,275 --> 01:20:19,403
LAURA: Shitballs...

1262
01:20:19,403 --> 01:20:23,153
(laughter)

1263
01:20:23,153 --> 01:20:29,410
MATT: As you guys are coming back to consciousness, you
see a shape that's just-- can't make out the

1264
01:20:29,410 --> 01:20:35,668
actual details of it, but it coasts across the
distant sky, across the clouds, and a little bit

1265
01:20:35,668 --> 01:20:37,276
of moonlight framing the image.

1266
01:20:37,276 --> 01:20:40,332
TALIESIN: I pull out Bad News and I'm just going
to try and use the scope to trail.

1267
01:20:40,332 --> 01:20:46,684
MATT: Okay. You pick it up and what you see in the
distance is a very, very large bird, cresting

1268
01:20:46,684 --> 01:20:51,639
across the distance. It doesn't appear to be
coming in your direction, but it just slowly makes

1269
01:20:51,639 --> 01:20:54,778
its way just over the opening in the canopy.

1270
01:20:54,778 --> 01:20:57,947
LIAM: I am of course reminded of the giant roc. Is
it the same shape?

1271
01:20:57,947 --> 01:21:01,491
MATT: It's pretty damn close. It disappears over
the opposite side--

1272
01:21:01,491 --> 01:21:02,764
SAM: Wait, is it our guy?

1273
01:21:02,764 --> 01:21:04,022
MARISHA: He lived!

1274
01:21:04,022 --> 01:21:09,409
LIAM: After I've kicked her, I grab Keyleth by the
shoulder and I start waking her up. Roc. Roc. Roc!

1275
01:21:09,409 --> 01:21:13,047
MARISHA: Does it look like the same one?

1276
01:21:13,047 --> 01:21:17,137
MATT: It does. You catch it just before it
disappears over the distant horizon. It arcs away

1277
01:21:17,137 --> 01:21:18,772
and then vanishes past.

1278
01:21:18,772 --> 01:21:21,447
MARISHA: (whispering) He made it!

1279
01:21:21,447 --> 01:21:23,161
TALIESIN: It's very pretty, I don't understand
what--

1280
01:21:23,161 --> 01:21:27,592
LAURA: It's the cow-roc. When we were cows! When
we saved a roc.

1281
01:21:27,592 --> 01:21:30,039
TALIESIN: Was I? I don't think I was there.

1282
01:21:30,039 --> 01:21:33,099
MARISHA: Percy was having-- you were having an
episode. And locked yourself in the basement.

1283
01:21:33,099 --> 01:21:35,284
LAURA: Oh shit, Percy.

1284
01:21:35,284 --> 01:21:38,664
MARY: Kash, it's the big bird.

1285
01:21:38,664 --> 01:21:40,201
WILL: I remember that.

1286
01:21:40,201 --> 01:21:41,508
LAURA: You've seen it?

1287
01:21:41,508 --> 01:21:43,076
MARY and WILL: Of course, of course.

1288
01:21:43,076 --> 01:21:45,998
WILL: When were you cows?

1289
01:21:45,998 --> 01:21:49,239
MARISHA: Oh, it's a long story.

1290
01:21:49,239 --> 01:21:50,789
WILL: Okay, fair enough.

1291
01:21:50,789 --> 01:21:53,496
MARISHA: We saved him, though, and we told him to
come here!

1292
01:21:53,496 --> 01:21:57,148
WILL: We see him all the time. A fixture in the
night sky.

1293
01:21:57,148 --> 01:22:02,077
TRAVIS: It was just a bird? I go back to sleep.

1294
01:22:02,077 --> 01:22:10,446
MATT: The rest of you go back to sleep. You guys
are finishing up your watch. Did you want to--?

1295
01:22:10,446 --> 01:22:11,525
WILL: I'll take a watch.

1296
01:22:11,525 --> 01:22:12,702
TALIESIN: All right, I'm out.

1297
01:22:12,702 --> 01:22:15,609
MATT: Okay. So is it just Kash taking this next
one?

1298
01:22:15,609 --> 01:22:19,691
SAM: Oh, I'll-- nope. (laughs) Do I need my sleep
still?

1299
01:22:19,691 --> 01:22:21,572
MATT: No, you've had a full eight hours' rest.

1300
01:22:21,572 --> 01:22:23,544
SAM: Okay, I'll stay with you.

1301
01:22:23,544 --> 01:22:24,633
WILL: Good. We'll nap it up.

1302
01:22:24,633 --> 01:22:27,894
LAURA: I elbow him. You're snoring
a-fucking-gain--

1303
01:22:27,894 --> 01:22:29,596
LIAM: Shut the fuck up.

1304
01:22:29,596 --> 01:22:39,853
SAM: So. I've seen you checking out some of the
members of our little group, here.

1305
01:22:39,853 --> 01:22:42,668
WILL: This is a very interesting group you have
here, that's for sure.

1306
01:22:42,668 --> 01:22:47,859
SAM: Listen, Vax doesn't fly that way, I don't
think. I know you've been eyeing him pretty good.

1307
01:22:47,859 --> 01:22:50,140
WILL: Huh?

1308
01:22:50,140 --> 01:22:59,300
SAM: Vax. I'm just looking out for you, brother.
He's not available for you.

1309
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:03,618
WILL: What else do your keen eyes perceive?

1310
01:23:03,618 --> 01:23:11,236
SAM: I see the way you've been flirting with him.
It's adorable.

1311
01:23:11,236 --> 01:23:14,598
WILL: That's funny. I didn't think anyone was
going to pick up on it.

1312
01:23:14,598 --> 01:23:19,276
SAM: Well, I'm a romantic, so I notice these
things.

1313
01:23:19,276 --> 01:23:22,695
WILL: You are that. You are that. He has a way
about him, you have to admit.

1314
01:23:22,695 --> 01:23:29,722
SAM: He does. He has a flair-- it's not my thing,
obviously. I go for the lady hookers.

1315
01:23:29,722 --> 01:23:32,317
WILL: Well. To each his own, am I right?

1316
01:23:32,317 --> 01:23:36,553
SAM: Yes, yes, but no, you have good taste in
men.

1317
01:23:36,553 --> 01:23:37,802
WILL: Yeah. Thank you.

1318
01:23:37,802 --> 01:23:39,373
SAM: He's a dashing young rogue.

1319
01:23:39,373 --> 01:23:41,815
WILL: He is. And this crew is lucky to have you.

1320
01:23:41,815 --> 01:23:46,620
SAM: Yes. Yes. They are. They really are. That's
your keen eye at work!

1321
01:23:46,620 --> 01:23:54,029
WILL: Well. We all see what we see, don't we?
Incredible. Just-- incredible.

1322
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:55,253
SAM: Can I give you a bit of advice?

1323
01:23:55,253 --> 01:23:56,731
WILL: Please. Please do.

1324
01:23:56,731 --> 01:24:04,040
SAM: You know, you have to follow your heart, so
if you do have feelings for the lad, you at least

1325
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:07,360
have to tell him. Even if he won't return them to
you.

1326
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:11,670
WILL: It's funny, I've been wanting to have a
conversation with him for quite a while now. We

1327
01:24:11,670 --> 01:24:14,711
have a lot to discuss.

1328
01:24:14,711 --> 01:24:16,414
SAM: Oh yes, what about?

1329
01:24:16,414 --> 01:24:20,949
WILL: Oh, you know, this and that. Feelings, as
you would call them. Romance, as you would say.

1330
01:24:20,949 --> 01:24:23,029
SAM: You are so in touch with those.

1331
01:24:23,029 --> 01:24:24,044
WILL: I know.

1332
01:24:24,044 --> 01:24:25,987
(laughter)

1333
01:24:25,987 --> 01:24:30,114
WILL: I do my best. When you've lived the
sheltered and wonderful life I have--

1334
01:24:30,114 --> 01:24:31,476
SAM: Oh, yes?

1335
01:24:31,476 --> 01:24:38,515
WILL: It's not often you meet a man like that. So
you run towards him. Some would say, with your

1336
01:24:38,515 --> 01:24:39,746
spear out.

1337
01:24:39,746 --> 01:24:42,671
(laughter)

1338
01:24:42,671 --> 01:24:44,830
SAM: TMI, my friend. TMI--

1339
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:50,672
WILL: That. Is funny. Well, you're right, we do
have quite a bit to talk about.

1340
01:24:50,672 --> 01:24:53,279
SAM: Yeah, we have another two and a half hours
on this watch.

1341
01:24:53,279 --> 01:24:59,402
LAURA: I wake up. Can you guys talk a little quieter?
Some of us are sleeping.

1342
01:24:59,402 --> 01:25:04,920
WILL: Are you going to be able to get her on board
with my little plan for her brother?

1343
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:07,503
SAM: I think she just wants her brother to be
happy, you know.

1344
01:25:07,503 --> 01:25:11,095
WILL: And that's wonderful. How do you come up
with your songs, by the way?

1345
01:25:11,095 --> 01:25:18,917
SAM: Oh, well, you know. I think of like, a word,
and then I try to think of a rhyme for it. Like,

1346
01:25:18,917 --> 01:25:26,233
'Kashaw', like, what could that be? That could be
'pshaw'! You know, something like that, I don't

1347
01:25:26,233 --> 01:25:28,612
know, I'm working on that, I'm working on it.

1348
01:25:28,612 --> 01:25:34,967
WILL: That's amazing. It's a skill that I've never
had before. But I guess as you said, when you

1349
01:25:34,967 --> 01:25:39,288
really take in the world and can see people and
how they feel, you can really

1350
01:25:39,288 --> 01:25:40,767
write a powerful ballad.

1351
01:25:40,767 --> 01:25:43,432
SAM: I'm a man of the world, I'm well-traveled,
I'm cultured--

1352
01:25:43,432 --> 01:25:47,483
TALIESIN: (snorts awake) Rickshaw, rickshaw--
(snores)

1353
01:25:47,483 --> 01:25:53,588
SAM: Rickshaw's a good one! Let me tell you,
secret weapon. I sleep near Percy a lot and he

1354
01:25:53,588 --> 01:26:02,371
rhymes in his sleep. It's the strangest thing.
Here, I'll show you, I'll show you. I haven't a

1355
01:26:02,371 --> 01:26:04,482
fear in the world!

1356
01:26:04,482 --> 01:26:08,308
TALIESIN: (mutters incomprehensibly)

1357
01:26:08,308 --> 01:26:10,700
(laughter)

1358
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:11,990
SAM: Sometimes it takes a while.

1359
01:26:11,990 --> 01:26:13,052
WILL: I don't. I don't understand.

1360
01:26:13,052 --> 01:26:14,051
SAM: It takes a while.

1361
01:26:14,051 --> 01:26:15,277
WILL: Okay.

1362
01:26:15,277 --> 01:26:18,483
TALIESIN: (mumbles) Something rhymes with world.

1363
01:26:18,483 --> 01:26:21,607
SAM: See? It's amazing. Every time. Every time.

1364
01:26:21,607 --> 01:26:23,427
WILL: Absolutely incredible.

1365
01:26:23,427 --> 01:26:24,722
MATT: As the hours pass--

1366
01:26:24,722 --> 01:26:26,442
(laughter)

1367
01:26:26,442 --> 01:26:34,750
MATT: Through intense conversation and learning
about one another, the sky comes to a glow with

1368
01:26:34,750 --> 01:26:36,194
the rising sun.

1369
01:26:36,194 --> 01:26:39,135
WILL: For the love of god, let something attack
us.

1370
01:26:39,135 --> 01:26:44,381
MATT: The rest of the group finds themselves to
consciousness. The cold morning air and frozen

1371
01:26:44,381 --> 01:26:51,541
bits of early-morning dew across the grass and
growth in the forest.

1372
01:26:51,541 --> 01:26:55,910
LIAM: Hm, my ears feel really hot this morning, I
don't know why that is.

1373
01:26:55,910 --> 01:26:57,850
TALIESIN: I've been breathing on them.

1374
01:26:57,850 --> 01:26:59,107
LIAM: What?

1375
01:26:59,107 --> 01:27:02,042
TRAVIS: What about the little hole in the lake
that we smashed? Is it still there, or did it

1376
01:27:02,042 --> 01:27:03,238
freeze over?

1377
01:27:03,238 --> 01:27:06,413
MATT: The hole's still there, but there is a very
thin layer of what appears to be forming ice that

1378
01:27:06,413 --> 01:27:07,794
could be easily cracked.

1379
01:27:07,794 --> 01:27:11,418
TRAVIS: I got it, I'll do that. And I go and take
my morning wee right on the little hole where it's

1380
01:27:11,418 --> 01:27:12,952
starting to freeze back over.

1381
01:27:12,952 --> 01:27:16,927
MATT: There you go. Grog has now effectively peed
in the Marrowglade Loch.

1382
01:27:16,927 --> 01:27:19,826
WILL: Kash walks over to also pee and looks down
at Grog and goes, "Holy god."

1383
01:27:19,826 --> 01:27:21,323
And just turns and walks.

1384
01:27:21,323 --> 01:27:24,509
(laughter)

1385
01:27:24,509 --> 01:27:26,688
TALIESIN: And that's canon, folks.

1386
01:27:26,688 --> 01:27:31,146
TRAVIS: That's the sound of 20,000 pens hitting
paper.

1387
01:27:31,146 --> 01:27:35,046
WILL: For the love of god.

1388
01:27:35,046 --> 01:27:45,321
MATT: Two weeks, folks. We've been storing this
up. All right. So what's the plan, guys?

1389
01:27:45,321 --> 01:27:51,241
LAURA: I guess we should breathe underwater and
head down, right?

1390
01:27:51,241 --> 01:27:53,687
WILL: Can we handle the cold, is the question I
want to know.

1391
01:27:53,687 --> 01:27:55,637
MARISHA: That is true. How cold is that lake?

1392
01:27:55,637 --> 01:28:01,674
MATT: It's-- the surface is near-freezing by the
just general temperature of the morning air.

1393
01:28:01,674 --> 01:28:07,411
You're liable to get hypothermia if you spend any
extended period of time in the water.

1394
01:28:07,411 --> 01:28:08,794
LAURA: Extended period.

1395
01:28:08,794 --> 01:28:12,591
WILL: Can we send somebody down to try to find the
entrance and get in before the rest of us go down

1396
01:28:12,591 --> 01:28:13,674
there and flounder around?

1397
01:28:13,674 --> 01:28:18,478
LAURA: I can, well. I have really good
perception, so. I can go down and see if I can

1398
01:28:18,478 --> 01:28:21,592
find an opening that you guys didn't see
yesterday.

1399
01:28:21,592 --> 01:28:25,313
LIAM: I'm going to take a walk around the whole
thing and see if I can see anything on the edges.

1400
01:28:25,313 --> 01:28:30,122
MARISHA: How big-- you said the lake was like 350
feet--

1401
01:28:30,122 --> 01:28:35,693
MATT: It's about 350 feet circumference around.
It's not a very, very large--

1402
01:28:35,693 --> 01:28:38,125
WILL: I can destroy water, but I don't know.

1403
01:28:38,125 --> 01:28:39,749
MARISHA: I can control water.

1404
01:28:39,749 --> 01:28:44,724
LAURA: Could you, like, make a, you know, parting
of the Red Sea sort of thing?

1405
01:28:44,724 --> 01:28:46,518
MARISHA: I might be able to, actually, yeah.

1406
01:28:46,518 --> 01:28:47,734
LAURA: Try that.

1407
01:28:47,734 --> 01:28:51,644
LIAM: Did a 22 perception check around the edge of
the loch find anything?

1408
01:28:51,644 --> 01:28:58,500
MATT: Nothing beyond the edge of the lake. There
isn't, I mean, you find bits and pieces of broken

1409
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:06,234
stone, but nothing that seems to be indicative of
a change in topography.

1410
01:29:06,234 --> 01:29:09,393
TALIESIN: I would actually say breathe underwater
would be the safer bet in case something happens.

1411
01:29:09,393 --> 01:29:13,725
If we have to escape, we don't want to necessarily
rely on your consciousness.

1412
01:29:13,725 --> 01:29:16,248
SAM: I can make us all look like fish.

1413
01:29:16,248 --> 01:29:24,033
LAURA: Oh, that's good. Useful. That could be
useful if something was attacking and they

1414
01:29:24,033 --> 01:29:25,252
wouldn't attack fish.

1415
01:29:25,252 --> 01:29:29,598
TALIESIN: Yes, they're like, oh look, fish, I'm
not going to eat that. I'm so bored of it.

1416
01:29:29,598 --> 01:29:31,059
SAM: I'll workshop that one.

1417
01:29:31,059 --> 01:29:37,492
LIAM: Yeah, it's good that you have it, but just
hold onto it for a rainy day.

1418
01:29:37,492 --> 01:29:43,150
MARISHA: I can focus to part the waters for
about ten minutes.

1419
01:29:43,150 --> 01:29:45,269
LIAM: Ten minutes? That's more than enough time.

1420
01:29:45,269 --> 01:29:46,740
LAURA: I'll run in, search around.

1421
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:48,815
SAM: You? We'll all run in!

1422
01:29:48,815 --> 01:29:52,036
LAURA: We'll all run in, search around like
maniacs for ten minutes.

1423
01:29:52,036 --> 01:29:53,619
LIAM: Grog, are you ready to dig?

1424
01:29:53,619 --> 01:29:54,592
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1425
01:29:54,592 --> 01:29:58,776
MARISHA: And then if we don't find anything, then
I can still cast Breathe Water on us.

1426
01:29:58,776 --> 01:30:01,076
SAM: How much water can you displace?

1427
01:30:01,076 --> 01:30:07,020
MATT: A cube of up to 100 feet on a side, so you
could pretty much part the entire lake.

1428
01:30:07,020 --> 01:30:09,355
LAURA: Let's do it and run down and search.

1429
01:30:09,355 --> 01:30:15,106
MARY: In doing so, could she get all the water out
of the lake so that it would be gone forever, or

1430
01:30:15,106 --> 01:30:17,417
is it just a temporary parting?

1431
01:30:17,417 --> 01:30:19,250
LAURA: I feel like that's killing a lot of
wildlife.

1432
01:30:19,250 --> 01:30:21,251
MARISHA: Are there a lot of fish in here?

1433
01:30:21,251 --> 01:30:26,362
MATT: You've been around. There are some fish that
live in here.

1434
01:30:26,362 --> 01:30:28,569
LIAM: Let's just get in there. Let's not destroy
the loch.

1435
01:30:28,569 --> 01:30:31,766
MARISHA: Yeah, I probably can't even get all of it
out, but let me-- Let me see what I can do.

1436
01:30:31,766 --> 01:30:34,960
MATT: So you cast Control Water?

1437
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:37,389
MARISHA: I guess I cast Control Water.

1438
01:30:37,389 --> 01:30:39,357
LAURA: Keyleth, I have total faith in you.

1439
01:30:39,357 --> 01:30:40,362
MARISHA: Thank you.

1440
01:30:40,362 --> 01:30:41,586
SAM: Go, Keyleth. Go.

1441
01:30:41,586 --> 01:30:48,302
MATT: As Keyleth completes the spell in a rapid
series of hand motions, concentrating, her eyes

1442
01:30:48,302 --> 01:30:55,361
illuminate with the power of her druidic, divine
energies. She extends her hands and the water

1443
01:30:55,361 --> 01:30:59,377
itself in the center of the lake, the ice cracks
up, almost like a fissure is building in the

1444
01:30:59,377 --> 01:31:03,513
center. It's almost like tin foil being folded
back from the inside out. The ice is actually

1445
01:31:03,513 --> 01:31:08,736
breaking and being pulled to the sides, and as the
ice is pulled back, the water is pulled back with

1446
01:31:08,736 --> 01:31:16,865
it, like someone has torn into the surface of the
earth and peeled the ice back like a sheet. It

1447
01:31:16,865 --> 01:31:23,305
forms this long tunnel that leads directly down
into the center of the lake. The water is being

1448
01:31:23,305 --> 01:31:29,451
held aloft over the surface, not actually being
cast to the sides out into the river. You could

1449
01:31:29,451 --> 01:31:33,030
empty the lake, for the most part, if you wanted
to do it now, but right now you're just holding it

1450
01:31:33,030 --> 01:31:36,052
aloft as these two water pillars.

1451
01:31:36,052 --> 01:31:39,313
TALIESIN: Could you build an ice tunnel, perhaps?
Take some of the ice and actually structure a--

1452
01:31:39,313 --> 01:31:44,484
MARISHA: I was going to say, actually, I think as
Control Water, I can also change if it freezes and

1453
01:31:44,484 --> 01:31:50,472
if it's solid? Can I freeze the edges of this?
Make an awesome--

1454
01:31:50,472 --> 01:31:55,279
MATT: You cannot refreeze water with this spell,
unfortunately. You can just control its shape. The

1455
01:31:55,279 --> 01:31:56,997
temperature is a whole different ballgame.

1456
01:31:56,997 --> 01:31:59,868
TALIESIN: But there is frozen-- we could take the
existing ice and create--

1457
01:31:59,868 --> 01:32:04,610
LAURA: You know what? I'm running in. And
Keyleth, just be ready to throw it away.

1458
01:32:04,610 --> 01:32:08,303
MARISHA: I'm just going to focus and keep pushing
it out.

1459
01:32:08,303 --> 01:32:11,525
LAURA: I run in and start looking for anything.

1460
01:32:11,525 --> 01:32:13,948
MARISHA: Go! Move fast, you have ten minutes!

1461
01:32:13,948 --> 01:32:18,397
MARY: I go to the entrance that was blocked and I
investigate to see whether or not there's any way

1462
01:32:18,397 --> 01:32:23,571
we can climb our way through. Focus on the
non-vegetative spots and get in.

1463
01:32:23,571 --> 01:32:25,839
LAURA: I'm going to that and seeing if there's
something there.

1464
01:32:25,839 --> 01:32:32,047
MATT: Okay. The stonework-- you can start pulling
the stones that block the area that lead into that

1465
01:32:32,047 --> 01:32:38,313
one collapsed entrance, and yeah. You start moving
things out of the way and they tumble down to the

1466
01:32:38,313 --> 01:32:43,857
bottom and stick into the mud. The bottom of the
pond is a very interesting sight when it's

1467
01:32:43,857 --> 01:32:48,961
drained. All the plant life is just sucked
together and you're all sloshing through. You're

1468
01:32:48,961 --> 01:32:52,409
up to your knees with each step as you just sink
into the mud.

1469
01:32:52,409 --> 01:32:54,142
SAM: It's a super muddy "ahnus."

1470
01:32:54,142 --> 01:33:00,219
MARISHA: I am going to go ahead and start pushing
some of the water outwards, out of the lake as I'm

1471
01:33:00,219 --> 01:33:01,947
keeping it pushed.

1472
01:33:01,947 --> 01:33:05,287
LAURA: I go to the hole, to the "ahnus," and start
looking.

1473
01:33:05,287 --> 01:33:11,104
MATT: Looking in there, as you begin to step into
the mud, it is a thicker portion and your feet

1474
01:33:11,104 --> 01:33:12,667
begin to sink into it.

1475
01:33:12,667 --> 01:33:15,277
TALIESIN: You can control water. Can you control
the water in the mud?

1476
01:33:15,277 --> 01:33:19,552
MARISHA: I've got a lot on my mind right now,
Percy!

1477
01:33:19,552 --> 01:33:22,265
TALIESIN: Okay. Okay, I was just throwing it out
there.

1478
01:33:22,265 --> 01:33:26,963
MATT: To a certain extent, you can control
elements of it, but because the earth itself is

1479
01:33:26,963 --> 01:33:33,302
not part of it, it does resist the spell effect,
so it would be very minimal effects. As you step

1480
01:33:33,302 --> 01:33:36,386
into it, you begin to sink.

1481
01:33:36,386 --> 01:33:39,864
LAURA: Oh, I just stepped right in, because I'm
really smart, you guys. Hold onto me.

1482
01:33:39,864 --> 01:33:41,139
LIAM: I start pulling.

1483
01:33:41,139 --> 01:33:42,594
MATT: Make a strength check.

1484
01:33:42,594 --> 01:33:48,588
LIAM: Oh, thank god I'm so strong. That is-- I'm
going to use Luck, and that's shit.

1485
01:33:48,588 --> 01:33:53,111
LAURA: I'm going. I'm sinking. Grog?

1486
01:33:53,111 --> 01:33:54,417
LIAM: 11. 11?

1487
01:33:54,417 --> 01:33:58,599
MATT: All right. The two twins are now, (sucking
sound) being pulled in into this small mire.

1488
01:33:58,599 --> 01:34:00,209
TRAVIS: What happened to you two?

1489
01:34:00,209 --> 01:34:02,457
LAURA: Grog, help. Seriously, quick.

1490
01:34:02,457 --> 01:34:05,520
LIAM: Remember how happy you were that I was
alive? That's not going to last much longer.

1491
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:07,524
LAURA: Come on, come on. Grog, help!

1492
01:34:07,524 --> 01:34:08,619
TRAVIS: How deep are they?

1493
01:34:08,619 --> 01:34:10,338
MATT: She's about up to her waist now.

1494
01:34:10,338 --> 01:34:11,580
TRAVIS: Nah, you're good. Just swim.

1495
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:16,704
MATT: Up to upper torso. Vax is now getting to
right around upper thigh.

1496
01:34:16,704 --> 01:34:22,006
TRAVIS: Oh, look. I mean, you're not even twinsies
about it. You're at different lengths. You've got

1497
01:34:22,006 --> 01:34:23,497
to even out a bit.

1498
01:34:23,497 --> 01:34:25,477
WILL: Don't struggle, or you'll sink faster.

1499
01:34:25,477 --> 01:34:27,730
MATT: Trinket's all, (concerned grunts).

1500
01:34:27,730 --> 01:34:32,283
LAURA: I take out my Rope of Infinite Twine and
throw it to Trinket's mouth from far away.

1501
01:34:32,283 --> 01:34:33,662
MATT: (chomp, grunt)

1502
01:34:33,662 --> 01:34:35,163
LAURA: Pull. Me. Out.

1503
01:34:35,163 --> 01:34:41,179
MATT: All right, and with that, Trinket begins to
back up. (sucking footsteps) Can't get traction in

1504
01:34:41,179 --> 01:34:45,306
the mud. He's trying to pull, but is sliding in
space.

1505
01:34:45,306 --> 01:34:46,788
LAURA: This sucks, you guys!

1506
01:34:46,788 --> 01:34:48,493
TALIESIN: I'm going to try to grab the rope.

1507
01:34:48,493 --> 01:34:58,983
LAURA: Grog, why are you being a dick-fuck? I need
to get out of this mud. Seriously?

1508
01:34:58,983 --> 01:35:00,632
TALIESIN: Ugh. That's a 12.

1509
01:35:00,632 --> 01:35:05,133
MATT: There's no movement on this point. You guys
are trying to pull and they're not sinking right

1510
01:35:05,133 --> 01:35:08,110
at the moment. There is tension on the rope, but
they're not being pulled out, either. They're just

1511
01:35:08,110 --> 01:35:09,303
held in place.

1512
01:35:09,303 --> 01:35:13,676
MARISHA: You all had better be making damn good
use of this time!

1513
01:35:13,676 --> 01:35:21,043
LAURA: Great use, Keyleth. We found an entrance
point. Ish.

1514
01:35:21,043 --> 01:35:24,103
SAM: Are we just at the edge of the pond?

1515
01:35:24,103 --> 01:35:26,893
MATT: You guys are now in the center of the base
of the pond.

1516
01:35:26,893 --> 01:35:28,548
SAM: But we haven't gotten to the part--

1517
01:35:28,548 --> 01:35:32,518
MATT: No, you guys are at the base of the stone
structure, which is not too far from the section

1518
01:35:32,518 --> 01:35:33,791
they're sinking in.

1519
01:35:33,791 --> 01:35:35,314
LIAM: Dying in slow motion over here.

1520
01:35:35,314 --> 01:35:37,269
MATT: You've been pulling rocks away from the
crumbled entrance, which is much easier now that

1521
01:35:37,269 --> 01:35:40,775
there isn't water pressed against it, so you're
actually moving rocks out of the way, and you're

1522
01:35:40,775 --> 01:35:42,323
making some headway into this entrance.

1523
01:35:42,323 --> 01:35:43,758
MARY: Do I even see them?

1524
01:35:43,758 --> 01:35:46,195
MATT: You see out of the corner of your eye, them
talking and shouting to each other.

1525
01:35:46,195 --> 01:35:48,936
MARY: Grog, come over here! Darling, I've got some
rocks you can move. Maybe we can

1526
01:35:48,936 --> 01:35:50,389
get in on this side.

1527
01:35:50,389 --> 01:35:52,322
LAURA: You're not going to even help? Cool.

1528
01:35:52,322 --> 01:35:55,258
MARY: I can't see you. Corner of my eye. I hear
you squabbling. You guys squabble all the time.

1529
01:35:55,258 --> 01:35:56,472
TRAVIS: Now, what are we moving?

1530
01:35:56,472 --> 01:35:57,987
LAURA: Seriously, we're dying! We're going to
die.

1531
01:35:57,987 --> 01:36:00,120
LIAM: We are sinking in the mud over here!

1532
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:03,306
MATT: Kima runs up to you guys, looks over and
goes, "Ah, they're fine," and starts grabbing rocks.

1533
01:36:03,306 --> 01:36:05,021
TRAVIS: Here we go, let's move this shit.

1534
01:36:05,021 --> 01:36:06,746
SAM: Hey, guys, you want a hand?

1535
01:36:06,746 --> 01:36:10,157
LAURA: Yes. Please get us out with Bigby.

1536
01:36:10,157 --> 01:36:20,741
SAM: So I will cast Bigby's Hand. And I will
gently lift them up and cup them as I pull them up

1537
01:36:20,741 --> 01:36:21,886
from the muck.

1538
01:36:21,886 --> 01:36:26,345
MATT: Easy enough to do. The giant, shimmering
arcane hand of Bigby scoops both of the twins up

1539
01:36:26,345 --> 01:36:34,719
and dislodges them from the muddy surface, setting
you guys down gently, and drifts to your side with

1540
01:36:34,719 --> 01:36:36,652
a thumbs-up.

1541
01:36:36,652 --> 01:36:38,555
(laughter)

1542
01:36:38,555 --> 01:36:41,238
TALIESIN: Since we have Bigby's Hand, why don't we
use it to--

1543
01:36:41,238 --> 01:36:44,961
SAM: Sure, sure, sure. What do you need me to
lift?

1544
01:36:44,961 --> 01:36:48,098
LAURA: Can you scoop out all the mud in that
fucking hole that just tried to kill us?

1545
01:36:48,098 --> 01:36:50,822
SAM: All right, let's scoop. We're scooping. I'm
scooping.

1546
01:36:50,822 --> 01:36:53,186
MATT: Are you scooping mud, or are you scooping
stone? I didn't hear which one you're doing.

1547
01:36:53,186 --> 01:36:55,609
SAM: I go with Zahra. What do you want me to
scoop, Zahra?

1548
01:36:55,609 --> 01:37:00,503
MARY: Oh, well, did I even hear any of this? I'm
still over there with Grog, moving--

1549
01:37:00,503 --> 01:37:03,797
TRAVIS: We're moving rocks.

1550
01:37:03,797 --> 01:37:08,428
MARY: We're moving rocks. (louder) I think we're
going to move rocks. Can you give us a hand with

1551
01:37:08,428 --> 01:37:09,358
the rocks?

1552
01:37:09,358 --> 01:37:11,610
SAM: Sure. Here it comes. Whee!

1553
01:37:11,610 --> 01:37:18,158
MATT: Okay. (laughs) I'll say, the two of you guys
make strength checks, and you go ahead and roll a

1554
01:37:18,158 --> 01:37:22,502
d20 and add your charisma-- no, Bigby's Hand is--

1555
01:37:22,502 --> 01:37:25,053
TRAVIS: 20.

1556
01:37:25,053 --> 01:37:29,761
TALIESIN: Wow, that's your wisdom modifier. Holy
cow.

1557
01:37:29,761 --> 01:37:31,497
SAM: Is that good or bad?

1558
01:37:31,497 --> 01:37:34,508
TALIESIN: That's awful. That's amazing. I've never
seen anything like it.

1559
01:37:34,508 --> 01:37:36,714
MATT: Yeah, plus eight to it.

1560
01:37:36,714 --> 01:37:38,286
SAM: 16.

1561
01:37:38,286 --> 01:37:40,212
MATT: 16, okay. 20 and?

1562
01:37:40,212 --> 01:37:41,266
MARY: Four.

1563
01:37:41,266 --> 01:37:42,980
MATT: Four. So you're "helping."

1564
01:37:42,980 --> 01:37:45,165
MARY: I'm more of a delegator.

1565
01:37:45,165 --> 01:37:50,038
MATT: Yeah, you're the foreman of this exercise.
But between Grog and Bigby's Hand, though, large

1566
01:37:50,038 --> 01:37:52,627
sections of stone are being scooped out and tossed
to the side.

1567
01:37:52,627 --> 01:37:56,235
MARISHA: I start tossing water out of this lake.

1568
01:37:56,235 --> 01:37:59,034
MATT: You're hitting the five- to six-minute mark.
It's a ten-minute duration.

1569
01:37:59,034 --> 01:38:01,178
You're a little past halfway.

1570
01:38:01,178 --> 01:38:04,191
MARISHA: Seeing that they're still doing a lot of
work, I'm going to start seeing if I can push some

1571
01:38:04,191 --> 01:38:06,116
of this water out of the lake a bit.

1572
01:38:06,116 --> 01:38:10,584
MATT: Okay. You push some of the water out of the
way. Some of it is splashing off to the side and

1573
01:38:10,584 --> 01:38:20,067
being soaked into the local dirt and earth. You're
still holding about half of the pond itself up at

1574
01:38:20,067 --> 01:38:24,533
the sides. You guys are beginning to make headway
through, and you see a lot of the stones here have

1575
01:38:24,533 --> 01:38:30,423
been pushed in with suction from the mud and kept
a barrier, and about three minutes later, you

1576
01:38:30,423 --> 01:38:34,593
begin to find an opening, and you start pulling
out a big plug of stone, and you can see beyond

1577
01:38:34,593 --> 01:38:39,766
that, there is an actual stairway, and a
pitch-black, lightless entrance that goes deeper

1578
01:38:39,766 --> 01:38:41,505
into this actual structure.

1579
01:38:41,505 --> 01:38:43,033
TALIESIN: Let's go.

1580
01:38:43,033 --> 01:38:48,147
TRAVIS: Well, problem. Stairway, but when water
comes back in, you drown in that stairway. So--

1581
01:38:48,147 --> 01:38:49,953
WILL: We'll have to block it up behind us.

1582
01:38:49,953 --> 01:38:52,239
MARY: Once this is done, can you cast one of
those--

1583
01:38:52,239 --> 01:38:57,155
MARISHA: Maybe? I start walking towards them.

1584
01:38:57,155 --> 01:39:02,153
LAURA: Once we're in and water's covering it,
we're not going to be able to get these stones away.

1585
01:39:02,153 --> 01:39:05,369
LIAM: Keyleth, can you walk down this way while
still doing that, and Scanlan, can you use Bigby's

1586
01:39:05,369 --> 01:39:08,248
Hand to block the hole once Keyleth is past you?

1587
01:39:08,248 --> 01:39:11,156
SAM: For a very small amount of time.

1588
01:39:11,156 --> 01:39:15,973
LIAM: Yeah, and then Keyleth, can you make a wall
of stone once you've let down the water?

1589
01:39:15,973 --> 01:39:18,819
MARISHA: Yes, if we try and go super fast.

1590
01:39:18,819 --> 01:39:20,105
LIAM: Let's do it.

1591
01:39:20,105 --> 01:39:21,840
MARY: I can cast Light and get us down there.

1592
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:27,056
SAM: Okay, I can make a wall behind us or
something.

1593
01:39:27,056 --> 01:39:32,151
MARISHA: I go and start heading towards the tunnel
and pushing all the water outwards.

1594
01:39:32,151 --> 01:39:36,037
MATT: Okay, so keeping the water at bay, now
rotating around your movement into the center, you

1595
01:39:36,037 --> 01:39:39,841
all make your way towards that rocky entrance.
It's just big enough to get each of you through,

1596
01:39:39,841 --> 01:39:45,384
Grog and Trinket, at the very largest. You all
push your way through, climbing in the other side.

1597
01:39:45,384 --> 01:39:51,555
Keyleth, concentrating, steps inside as the last
one as you begin, with the last few minutes you have.

1598
01:39:51,555 --> 01:39:53,530
SAM: I guess I'll just pack it with mud and rocks,
right?

1599
01:39:53,530 --> 01:39:59,432
MATT: Just taking it all. Chunk after chunk after
chunk. Just at the tail end of your concentration.

1600
01:39:59,432 --> 01:40:05,412
The hand pulls in the last plug as the water
(crashing water sound) comes crashing into itself,

1601
01:40:05,412 --> 01:40:10,772
filling the space. As you all are standing there,
the light of Zahra's staff lighting the area,

1602
01:40:10,772 --> 01:40:16,062
there's the impact of water rushing in against the
stonework, and you can feel the whole place shake

1603
01:40:16,062 --> 01:40:21,214
from the impact, and immediately water begins to
rush in through the cracks of

1604
01:40:21,214 --> 01:40:22,735
this created section.

1605
01:40:22,735 --> 01:40:23,677
LAURA: Oh!

1606
01:40:23,677 --> 01:40:24,925
SAM: I'm not a good builder!

1607
01:40:24,925 --> 01:40:26,316
(laughter)

1608
01:40:26,316 --> 01:40:28,143
LIAM: Hold it, Scanlan, hold it for a moment!

1609
01:40:28,143 --> 01:40:32,528
MATT: I was going to say, based on the push of the
water against the rock and Bigby's Hand against

1610
01:40:32,528 --> 01:40:35,662
that, I need you to go ahead and roll a d20 and
add eight for Bigby's strength to try and hold the

1611
01:40:35,662 --> 01:40:37,712
plug in place.

1612
01:40:37,712 --> 01:40:42,284
SAM: 24.

1613
01:40:42,284 --> 01:40:48,951
MATT: 24 total roll. With that impact, you can see
streams of water pushing through and mud and other

1614
01:40:48,951 --> 01:40:55,219
elements filling the gaps of the stonework,
Bigby's Hand pushing up against it. Looks like the

1615
01:40:55,219 --> 01:40:59,459
stonework was ready to give, and the water begins
to go ahead and fill this vicinity, the hand

1616
01:40:59,459 --> 01:41:04,846
pushes back until the streams that are peeking
through turn to a trickle, and by the time the

1617
01:41:04,846 --> 01:41:13,671
spell finally comes to an end, the hand vanishes,
the plugged hole gives a little bit, and then

1618
01:41:13,671 --> 01:41:18,061
seems to keep itself in place. Water's still
dribbling out and trickling, there is still a

1619
01:41:18,061 --> 01:41:23,683
gradual bit of moisture passing through here, and
you don't know how long it'll hold, but for the

1620
01:41:23,683 --> 01:41:25,243
time being, it seems to be holding.

1621
01:41:25,243 --> 01:41:26,112
SAM: Yikes.

1622
01:41:26,112 --> 01:41:27,097
MARY: Well done, Scanlan.

1623
01:41:27,097 --> 01:41:28,569
SAM: Thank you for the idea.

1624
01:41:28,569 --> 01:41:34,083
LIAM: Well, we could risk it or-- Keyleth, are you
able to put up a wall?

1625
01:41:34,083 --> 01:41:38,960
TALIESIN: I think we can risk it for now.

1626
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:41,775
TRAVIS: Yeah, risk it. Because we have to come back
through this way, probably.

1627
01:41:41,775 --> 01:41:43,388
LAURA: That's true, if something happens you can
put it up.

1628
01:41:43,388 --> 01:41:47,422
MARISHA: Let's head downstairs, and we might not
need to worry about this in a second.

1629
01:41:47,422 --> 01:41:49,170
TRAVIS: Hey, sneaky-sneaky, go take a look.

1630
01:41:49,170 --> 01:41:51,050
LIAM: Are you talking to her or me?

1631
01:41:51,050 --> 01:41:52,470
TRAVIS: No, you, shitbrain.

1632
01:41:52,470 --> 01:41:54,833
LAURA: Hey, you know what? We're not doing
anything for you, you fuck, 'cause you didn't even

1633
01:41:54,833 --> 01:41:55,833
try to help us.

1634
01:41:55,833 --> 01:41:58,641
TRAVIS: Oh, look at me, digging in a muddy hole
that led to nowhere.

1635
01:41:58,641 --> 01:42:02,113
LIAM: I let them argue and I skulk forward. While
they're fighting.

1636
01:42:02,113 --> 01:42:06,377
Natural 20.

1637
01:42:06,377 --> 01:42:08,354
WILL: See that? My man's going to check some stuff
out.

1638
01:42:08,354 --> 01:42:09,785
SAM: Ah, you must be so proud.

1639
01:42:09,785 --> 01:42:11,083
WILL: Very excited.

1640
01:42:11,083 --> 01:42:14,271
MATT: So, as Vax vanishes from your sight,
disappearing into the shadows down the stairway

1641
01:42:14,271 --> 01:42:16,143
that leads forward, we're going to take a quick
break.

1642
01:42:16,143 --> 01:42:19,088
(cheering)

1643
01:42:19,088 --> 01:42:24,419
MATT: We'll be right back, so get your snacks, get
your bathroom on, we'll be here

1644
01:42:24,419 --> 01:42:25,740
as soon as possible.

1645
01:42:25,740 --> 01:42:27,056
LIAM: Get your Purvan.

1646
01:42:27,056 --> 01:42:31,820
ALL: Get your Purvan!

1647
01:42:31,820 --> 01:42:36,379
MATT: You're all going to die. All of you.

1648
01:42:36,379 --> 01:42:38,428
MARY: And they never made it out of the tunnel.

1649
01:42:38,428 --> 01:57:00,240
[break]

1650
01:57:00,240 --> 01:57:03,889
MATT: Welcome back, everyone. So we've had our
little break here, a couple quick announcements to

1651
01:57:03,889 --> 01:57:09,081
give to you guys. One, our first winner of the
giveaway today, of the chatroom giveaway for our

1652
01:57:09,081 --> 01:57:12,399
various prize package is BlackDeath2099.

1653
01:57:12,399 --> 01:57:15,235
(laughter)

1654
01:57:15,235 --> 01:57:20,166
MATT: Congratulations. I'm glad we have a little
ways off before we have to worry about that. Or

1655
01:57:20,166 --> 01:57:27,783
maybe Marvel will rekindle that comic series. But
yeah, so, congratulations, BlackDeath2099. Also, a

1656
01:57:27,783 --> 01:57:33,216
reminder to all of our European viewers, we here
in the US, 'cause we're ridiculous and still do

1657
01:57:33,216 --> 01:57:38,239
this whole timechange thing, we are springing
forward, it's our Daylight Savings, so the show

1658
01:57:38,239 --> 01:57:42,169
will actually be airing an hour earlier for you
guys, which might be pretty good for you guys.

1659
01:57:42,169 --> 01:57:45,431
WILL: So everyone can work on the farms.

1660
01:57:45,431 --> 01:57:48,814
MARISHA: Yes. Which no one-- and it doesn't even
work there.

1661
01:57:48,814 --> 01:57:50,669
WILL: Damn you, Benjamin Franklin.

1662
01:57:50,669 --> 01:57:52,385
MARY: What is today for Critical Role?

1663
01:57:52,385 --> 01:57:54,862
MATT: Today is our one-year anniversary of the
stream.

1664
01:57:54,862 --> 01:57:56,908
(cheering)

1665
01:57:56,908 --> 01:57:58,951
MATT: We were so rushed at the start, we didn't
get around to it.

1666
01:57:58,951 --> 01:58:00,854
LAURA: We didn't even talk about how it's our
one-year anniversary--

1667
01:58:00,854 --> 01:58:02,838
MATT: It's our one-year, it's been a rushed day.

1668
01:58:02,838 --> 01:58:05,617
SAM: What do you get for a one-year anniversary?
Is it paper?

1669
01:58:05,617 --> 01:58:06,493
MARISHA: Paper.

1670
01:58:06,493 --> 01:58:08,134
WILL: I got it!

1671
01:58:08,134 --> 01:58:10,664
(cheering)

1672
01:58:10,664 --> 01:58:11,912
WILL: Happy anniversary.

1673
01:58:11,912 --> 01:58:13,326
MATT: So, I mean, thank you guys.

1674
01:58:13,326 --> 01:58:14,862
MARISHA: We get tons of fanart, that's paper.

1675
01:58:14,862 --> 01:58:16,090
LAURA: That is paper.

1676
01:58:16,090 --> 01:58:18,766
MATT: Thank you guys for kicking along with us
for a year.

1677
01:58:18,766 --> 01:58:23,019
LIAM: We got a very nice anniversary present from
Megzilla. From Meg.

1678
01:58:23,019 --> 01:58:24,592
LAURA: Oh my gosh, it's so beautiful.

1679
01:58:24,592 --> 01:58:25,961
MARISHA: It's my background now.

1680
01:58:25,961 --> 01:58:29,414
LAURA: Mine too! Is yours just you? 'Cause mine is
just me and Pike!

1681
01:58:29,414 --> 01:58:32,869
MARISHA: Me and Pike, it's the only ones, 'cause
it can't fit all of us, you have to try and frame it.

1682
01:58:32,869 --> 01:58:34,673
LIAM: She's a unifying entity.

1683
01:58:34,673 --> 01:58:41,537
MATT: Also, guys, wanted to let you know before we
get started here again. You helped our good friend

1684
01:58:41,537 --> 01:58:48,213
here Ivan, is doing his Kickstarter for
the ABC's of RPG's, which is awesome, but one of

1685
01:58:48,213 --> 01:58:52,811
the stretch goals was to actually have a few pages
of Critical Role-related activities for kids

1686
01:58:52,811 --> 01:58:57,302
within the book, and you guys succeeded in
smashing through that stretch goal, so he gave me

1687
01:58:57,302 --> 01:59:00,329
a couple of the early designs to show off. Here's
the--

1688
01:59:00,329 --> 01:59:01,746
LAURA: We can show it?

1689
01:59:01,746 --> 01:59:04,667
MATT: Yeah, we can show a little bit of the
preliminary stuff. So this is the Vex and Vax

1690
01:59:04,667 --> 01:59:06,690
connect-the-dots.

1691
01:59:06,690 --> 01:59:08,547
(cheering)

1692
01:59:08,547 --> 01:59:12,909
MATT: So this'll be part of the presentation of
that activity, which is fantastic.

1693
01:59:12,909 --> 01:59:16,168
LAURA: And this is artwork by Wendy.

1694
01:59:16,168 --> 01:59:18,932
MARISHA: Put it on the thing, on the paper.

1695
01:59:18,932 --> 01:59:20,224
MATT: On the paper?

1696
01:59:20,224 --> 01:59:23,053
MARISHA: Right on-- right, yeah. There you go.

1697
01:59:23,053 --> 01:59:31,985
MATT: Then we have here, we have the create
tattoos for Grog activity sheet.

1698
01:59:31,985 --> 01:59:35,786
LIAM: Yes! Yes, I can draw all the penises I want
on him!

1699
01:59:35,786 --> 01:59:43,326
MATT: So there's that one there. And then here we
have the Percy connect your knowledge of the

1700
01:59:43,326 --> 01:59:45,991
various fantasy creatures activity book.

1701
01:59:45,991 --> 01:59:47,495
LAURA: Baby, baby creatures!

1702
01:59:47,495 --> 01:59:52,514
WILL: I'd like to point out, the rakshasa with the
hands. It's doing jazz hands!

1703
01:59:52,514 --> 01:59:57,103
MATT: So those are the really cool art pieces you
can look forward to, you guys kicked ass on

1704
01:59:57,103 --> 02:00:02,037
making that happen and so we have our own little
stamp in his amazing creative piece, so thank you

1705
02:00:02,037 --> 02:00:06,102
for that. Look to that. There's also more stretch
goals, I think, before it finishes up, so if you

1706
02:00:06,102 --> 02:00:08,248
want to smash those records, feel free to check it
out.

1707
02:00:08,248 --> 02:00:09,667
TALIESIN: Smash.

1708
02:00:09,667 --> 02:00:12,024
MATT: Thank you for letting us be part of that,
Ivan.

1709
02:00:12,024 --> 02:00:13,926
MARY: Grog smash with moon hammer.

1710
02:00:13,926 --> 02:00:25,202
MATT: All right. So. Now. As you guys-- bringing
it back to the game, here. I think those are all

1711
02:00:25,202 --> 02:00:30,804
the announcements I'm supposed to make there,
perfect. Let me get set up here with some proper

1712
02:00:30,804 --> 02:00:35,852
audio. I want to get some good atmosphere here.

1713
02:00:35,852 --> 02:00:37,607
TRAVIS: Imperial Death March?

1714
02:00:37,607 --> 02:00:40,406
MARY and LAURA: (sing Imperial March)

1715
02:00:40,406 --> 02:00:53,860
(all warble Imperial March)

1716
02:00:53,860 --> 02:00:56,271
TALIESIN: Are we Death Star chickens? What's
happening?

1717
02:00:56,271 --> 02:00:57,642
MATT: That got weird.

1718
02:00:57,642 --> 02:01:00,041
LIAM: They just cut the power on our show.

1719
02:01:00,041 --> 02:01:10,257
MATT: So. Are you guys all staying at the top of
the stairs, or are you staying a little bit behind

1720
02:01:10,257 --> 02:01:11,739
Vax's movement?

1721
02:01:11,739 --> 02:01:13,096
LIAM: I'm 20 feet ahead.

1722
02:01:13,096 --> 02:01:20,027
LAURA: We're moving-- But we should probably, I
don't know, stealth? I don't know what would be

1723
02:01:20,027 --> 02:01:27,867
alive down here, but there might be undead.
Actually, can I take a moment and use Primeval

1724
02:01:27,867 --> 02:01:34,475
Awareness and sense if there's any undead entities
around, any ghostly or undead zombies?

1725
02:01:34,475 --> 02:01:35,809
Anything undead?

1726
02:01:35,809 --> 02:01:38,217
LIAM: And I-- sorry. Rolled a 30 for perception.

1727
02:01:38,217 --> 02:01:40,058
LAURA: Aberrations?

1728
02:01:40,058 --> 02:01:45,663
MATT: Which one are you focusing on? I think you
have to choose the type.

1729
02:01:45,663 --> 02:01:49,059
LAURA: Let's start with undead.

1730
02:01:49,059 --> 02:01:53,643
MATT: Undead? You take a moment, focusing here--

1731
02:01:53,643 --> 02:01:55,111
LAURA: Up to six miles.

1732
02:01:55,111 --> 02:01:59,621
MATT: Yes. As Vax pushes forward. Nothing catches
your attention, undead-wise. There are no undead

1733
02:01:59,621 --> 02:02:04,645
entities within the vicinity which you can focus
on, so that's one thing you

1734
02:02:04,645 --> 02:02:06,796
don't got to worry about.

1735
02:02:06,796 --> 02:02:08,247
LAURA: One thing.

1736
02:02:08,247 --> 02:02:14,095
WILL: I think because Z is in the front with her
light, Kash backs all the way up to the back and

1737
02:02:14,095 --> 02:02:15,815
lights a light, as well.

1738
02:02:15,815 --> 02:02:22,348
MATT: All right, so the two of you have light from
this pitch-dark vicinity, which is helpful for

1739
02:02:22,348 --> 02:02:32,060
those of human descent. No undead presence in the
vicinity. Vax, pushing down this stairwell, it

1740
02:02:32,060 --> 02:02:39,737
continues down with a slight curvature, almost
like a gradual spiral staircase, until eventually

1741
02:02:39,737 --> 02:02:47,668
it hits a floor area. The flooring here is at a
tilt. From what you can see, this whole tomb, this

1742
02:02:47,668 --> 02:02:54,494
whole ruin, when it sank in, it sank at a slight
angle, and the surface of all the stonework here

1743
02:02:54,494 --> 02:03:02,736
is still slick with water and various liquid that
has trickled through over time. You get the sense

1744
02:03:02,736 --> 02:03:08,717
that there are a number of leaks within this
temple, and the pond that would grow larger is

1745
02:03:08,717 --> 02:03:14,706
steadily slipping into this ruin, and then being
filled over time from the rainy and snowy weather

1746
02:03:14,706 --> 02:03:16,567
as it hits the area.

1747
02:03:16,567 --> 02:03:27,896
As you hit the bottom and you look around, you see
ahead, immediately across the way, as you're the

1748
02:03:27,896 --> 02:03:33,304
first in there, two small humanoid shapes down
this T-junction. To the right and left of you are

1749
02:03:33,304 --> 02:03:38,894
two tunnels, and there is one ahead, and about 35
to 40 feet ahead of you, you see two humanoid

1750
02:03:38,894 --> 02:03:40,295
individuals.

1751
02:03:40,295 --> 02:03:46,481
LIAM: We've already got company. I see two small
little buggers ahead of me.

1752
02:03:46,481 --> 02:03:48,164
I don't know what they are.

1753
02:03:48,164 --> 02:03:50,107
LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace on the group.

1754
02:03:50,107 --> 02:03:55,504
SAM: Can you kill them?

1755
02:03:55,504 --> 02:04:00,481
LIAM: I don't know yet. Just wait for a second.
I'm going to sit for a minute. One minute, and see

1756
02:04:00,481 --> 02:04:01,782
what they do.

1757
02:04:01,782 --> 02:04:02,929
LAURA: Can we stealth?

1758
02:04:02,929 --> 02:04:04,140
MARISHA: Yeah, let's all stealth.

1759
02:04:04,140 --> 02:04:06,313
MATT: All right. Everyone roll stealth. Are you
keeping your light spells up?

1760
02:04:06,313 --> 02:04:07,561
MARY and WILL: No.

1761
02:04:07,561 --> 02:04:10,207
MATT: Both of you snuff the light spells, so you
have zero visibility right now.

1762
02:04:10,207 --> 02:04:11,672
LIAM: I am really well-hidden.

1763
02:04:11,672 --> 02:04:12,786
MARY: I've got darkvision.

1764
02:04:12,786 --> 02:04:14,336
TRAVIS: I do, too.

1765
02:04:14,336 --> 02:04:15,718
SAM: So do I.

1766
02:04:15,718 --> 02:04:17,000
MATT: Stealth checks from everybody?

1767
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:18,262
LIAM: I am covered in mud.

1768
02:04:18,262 --> 02:04:20,749
LAURA: Oh, that's true. We are really
camouflaged.

1769
02:04:20,749 --> 02:04:22,493
LIAM: The twins are dark right now.

1770
02:04:22,493 --> 02:04:24,753
MARISHA: I rolled a natural one.

1771
02:04:24,753 --> 02:04:26,759
LAURA: No, add ten to it.

1772
02:04:26,759 --> 02:04:28,197
MARISHA: 11.

1773
02:04:28,197 --> 02:04:29,686
WILL: 14.

1774
02:04:29,686 --> 02:04:32,407
TALIESIN: 32.

1775
02:04:32,407 --> 02:04:33,494
SAM: 30.

1776
02:04:33,494 --> 02:04:35,060
MARY: 22.

1777
02:04:35,060 --> 02:04:36,411
LAURA: 28.

1778
02:04:36,411 --> 02:04:37,515
TRAVIS: 17.

1779
02:04:37,515 --> 02:04:39,125
MATT: 17. With the plus ten?

1780
02:04:39,125 --> 02:04:40,389
WILL: 14.

1781
02:04:40,389 --> 02:04:41,678
MATT: 14. With the plus ten?

1782
02:04:41,678 --> 02:04:42,995
WILL: No, then it's 24.

1783
02:04:42,995 --> 02:04:44,148
MATT: 24. Okay.

1784
02:04:44,148 --> 02:04:46,177
LIAM: Is there any light here? Dim light?

1785
02:04:46,177 --> 02:04:47,399
MATT: There is no light.

1786
02:04:47,399 --> 02:04:49,596
MARY: We just doused it. Grog and I can see.

1787
02:04:49,596 --> 02:04:50,679
TRAVIS: Darkvision.

1788
02:04:50,679 --> 02:04:58,728
MATT: These two figures just walk beyond. What
little bit you can see, and both of you guys roll

1789
02:04:58,728 --> 02:05:00,543
perception checks, those with darkvision right
now.

1790
02:05:00,543 --> 02:05:04,000
SAM: Oh, wait. Darkvision?

1791
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,006
MARY: Natural 20. Natural 20.

1792
02:05:06,006 --> 02:05:07,939
WILL: Yeah! That's your second one?

1793
02:05:07,939 --> 02:05:09,182
TRAVIS: 14.

1794
02:05:09,182 --> 02:05:15,671
MATT: 14. The two of you can see these entities.
They're humanoid. Bipedal-- two arms, two legs,

1795
02:05:15,671 --> 02:05:23,669
standing up on their legs. However, their feet are
these webbed claw-type physicality. They're

1796
02:05:23,669 --> 02:05:29,258
wearing haphazard leather tunics, wrappings around
their wrists, and they're hunched forward as

1797
02:05:29,258 --> 02:05:34,186
they're walking away from you, deeper into the
shadows. Seemingly completely unnoticing of your

1798
02:05:34,186 --> 02:05:41,404
presence. Their heads are these bowed-forward
fish-type visions. You can see they have these

1799
02:05:41,404 --> 02:05:47,714
bulbous eyes at the edges, jagged, toothy mouths
that end at this small point to the end. Very,

1800
02:05:47,714 --> 02:05:55,712
very fish-like, amphibious-type entities. They
both scuffle alongside each other and shuffle into

1801
02:05:55,712 --> 02:05:58,068
the darkness beyond, down that further hallway.

1802
02:05:58,068 --> 02:06:00,635
LIAM: They're walking in pitch black, right?

1803
02:06:00,635 --> 02:06:01,641
MATT: Yes.

1804
02:06:01,641 --> 02:06:02,996
MARY: We have tunnels left and right?

1805
02:06:02,996 --> 02:06:04,953
MATT: Left and right and in front, where they both
disappeared.

1806
02:06:04,953 --> 02:06:08,303
MARY: We don't hear them speaking, we don't hear
them doing anything?

1807
02:06:08,303 --> 02:06:09,947
MATT: No, they're just walking.

1808
02:06:09,947 --> 02:06:13,376
MARISHA: Do they look to be on patrol? Are they
walking back and forth?

1809
02:06:13,376 --> 02:06:14,972
MATT: They're just walking. They haven't turned
back.

1810
02:06:14,972 --> 02:06:16,471
WILL: Are they armed?

1811
02:06:16,471 --> 02:06:21,640
MATT: Yes, you can see, both of them have what
looks to be a cluster of ropes to one side,

1812
02:06:21,640 --> 02:06:26,718
hanging off their belt, and have spears that
they're clutching and walking along.

1813
02:06:26,718 --> 02:06:29,650
MARY: Are the ropes attached to the spears?

1814
02:06:29,650 --> 02:06:31,050
MATT: No.

1815
02:06:31,050 --> 02:06:32,239
MARY: Do they have eyeballs?

1816
02:06:32,239 --> 02:06:33,286
MATT: They do.

1817
02:06:33,286 --> 02:06:35,743
MARY: What color are they? I'm sorry.

1818
02:06:35,743 --> 02:06:37,722
MATT: There's no color in darkvision. It's black
and white.

1819
02:06:37,722 --> 02:06:42,652
TRAVIS: Everyone listen up. There's two of them
and they're walking away from us down a hall. They

1820
02:06:42,652 --> 02:06:44,033
don't see us yet.

1821
02:06:44,033 --> 02:06:48,955
MARY: They appear to be some sort of fish-like
creature. They've got spears and ropes.

1822
02:06:48,955 --> 02:06:55,205
LAURA: You know what? I bet if they live in the
dark, light will blind them.

1823
02:06:55,205 --> 02:06:58,402
MARY: You know? You're very smart.

1824
02:06:58,402 --> 02:07:00,715
LIAM: Are we all huddled together at this point?

1825
02:07:00,715 --> 02:07:02,911
MATT: They've all gathered down to the bottom--

1826
02:07:02,911 --> 02:07:06,919
LIAM: They came up behind me, right? Yeah, so
you're talking into your ear to me.

1827
02:07:06,919 --> 02:07:07,962
LAURA: Guess what?

1828
02:07:07,962 --> 02:07:09,378
LIAM: What? What's going on?

1829
02:07:09,378 --> 02:07:10,883
LAURA: There's fish people up ahead.

1830
02:07:10,883 --> 02:07:16,647
LIAM: It sounded like that, but I can't see shit
down here. Zahra, you were able to see?

1831
02:07:16,647 --> 02:07:22,396
MARISHA: I poke my head in between the twins and I
go, do you guys have an earache? Does your ear hurt?

1832
02:07:22,396 --> 02:07:24,594
LAURA: Can you see us? We can't see anything.

1833
02:07:24,594 --> 02:07:26,246
LIAM: You can't see shit, either.

1834
02:07:26,246 --> 02:07:30,958
LAURA: Should we get some light?

1835
02:07:30,958 --> 02:07:37,741
MARY: Should we-- there's a tunnel to the left
and there's a tunnel to the right.

1836
02:07:37,741 --> 02:07:41,431
LIAM: I pull out my Flametongue Dagger and make
dim light.

1837
02:07:41,431 --> 02:07:46,001
MATT: Okay, so as the dagger gives off a bit of
flame, those of you with low-light vision have

1838
02:07:46,001 --> 02:07:53,096
extended visual at this point. At this point, too,
as you're adjusting to the atmosphere here, there

1839
02:07:53,096 --> 02:07:58,683
is this very heavy smell of mold and mildew
throughout this entire area, and looking down, you

1840
02:07:58,683 --> 02:08:04,736
can see the bit of light dances across the stone
floor that has water trickling across it and

1841
02:08:04,736 --> 02:08:12,667
leading to one side, to the left, with the tilt of
the floor. What do you wish to do?

1842
02:08:12,667 --> 02:08:22,785
LIAM: Well, we can follow the fish brothers, or we
could check out these two tunnels.

1843
02:08:22,785 --> 02:08:23,749
TRAVIS: I like that.

1844
02:08:23,749 --> 02:08:31,794
LAURA: I have a question. In my book that I bought
for 30 gold, did it mention what level of the

1845
02:08:31,794 --> 02:08:34,638
multi-level tomb the champion was buried on?

1846
02:08:34,638 --> 02:08:41,720
MATT: No, there wasn't much detail about the
tomb's actual build. It spoke more of the history

1847
02:08:41,720 --> 02:08:48,462
of the man who was buried there and gave reference
to the direction you were traveling to, just to

1848
02:08:48,462 --> 02:08:51,401
reaffirm you were going in the right way.

1849
02:08:51,401 --> 02:08:52,514
LIAM: You got played.

1850
02:08:52,514 --> 02:08:54,892
LAURA: I got played. It was a worthless 30 gold,
then.

1851
02:08:54,892 --> 02:09:01,144
MATT: No, you learned information about the
history of the man who's buried here. It's not

1852
02:09:01,144 --> 02:09:05,470
like every stone structure of ancient history has
a book of blueprints available at your local

1853
02:09:05,470 --> 02:09:06,564
7-Eleven.

1854
02:09:06,564 --> 02:09:07,884
WILL: That was 60 gold.

1855
02:09:07,884 --> 02:09:09,820
MATT: Yeah, that's a little more expensive.

1856
02:09:09,820 --> 02:09:15,491
MARY: All right, Grog. Since you and I have
darkvision-- Is it still-- did you cast Light?

1857
02:09:15,491 --> 02:09:20,449
MATT: No, you can see Vax is holding out his flame
dagger. It has a little bit of fire trickling off

1858
02:09:20,449 --> 02:09:24,404
it. It's ever-so-gently lighting the very local
area.

1859
02:09:24,404 --> 02:09:28,111
MARY: I'd like to investigate the tunnel to the
left.

1860
02:09:28,111 --> 02:09:29,572
TRAVIS: And I'll look at the one on the right.

1861
02:09:29,572 --> 02:09:31,235
MATT: To the left. You go to the one on the
right.

1862
02:09:31,235 --> 02:09:34,968
TRAVIS: I tell Vax to stay on my six as I go up.

1863
02:09:34,968 --> 02:09:36,415
WILL: And I follow Z.

1864
02:09:36,415 --> 02:09:41,952
MATT: Okay. So we have Grog and Vex are heading to
the right?

1865
02:09:41,952 --> 02:09:43,107
LAURA: Vax.

1866
02:09:43,107 --> 02:09:48,651
MATT: Sorry. Grog and Vax are heading to the
right, and Zahra and Kash are going to the left.

1867
02:09:48,651 --> 02:09:50,539
Anyone else? Everyone else staying in the center?

1868
02:09:50,539 --> 02:09:51,968
TALIESIN: Staying center.

1869
02:09:51,968 --> 02:09:54,085
MARISHA: I'll stay center with Percy.

1870
02:09:54,085 --> 02:09:55,630
SAM: I'm going to go with Zahra.

1871
02:09:55,630 --> 02:09:59,181
MARY: I've noticed that you all have some sort of
earpiece. Do you have any extra?

1872
02:09:59,181 --> 02:10:02,606
SAM: No, but I'm going to go with you, so I'll be
able to report.

1873
02:10:02,606 --> 02:10:03,698
WILL: Oh, great.

1874
02:10:03,698 --> 02:10:06,166
MATT: Okay, two of you stay behind.

1875
02:10:06,166 --> 02:10:08,661
SAM: Kash, are you sure you don't want to go with
Vax?

1876
02:10:08,661 --> 02:10:09,904
WILL: No, I'm good. Thank you.

1877
02:10:09,904 --> 02:10:11,182
SAM: All right.

1878
02:10:11,182 --> 02:10:20,245
MATT: All right, so. Grog and Vax, you guys
traverse to the right, with what little light he's

1879
02:10:20,245 --> 02:10:26,288
giving off the dagger. It continues for about 15
feet before it curves sharply to the right. Roll a

1880
02:10:26,288 --> 02:10:28,021
perception check, Grog.

1881
02:10:28,021 --> 02:10:32,410
TRAVIS: I have that darkvision, too. That's not
bad. 17.

1882
02:10:32,410 --> 02:10:40,968
MATT: 17? You turn the corner and manage to stop
yourself just as your feet meet the edge of where

1883
02:10:40,968 --> 02:10:48,614
the stone flooring has dropped out. The tunnel
itself here just seems to have ended, and there is

1884
02:10:48,614 --> 02:10:54,729
a chasm that disappears beneath your visual range.
A couple of stones (cracking noise) crumble--

1885
02:10:54,729 --> 02:10:57,354
TRAVIS: Stop. Stop, stop, stop. Get back. Back
up.

1886
02:10:57,354 --> 02:11:01,499
MATT: You hear them, after a number of seconds,
eventually hit with a slight splash of water.

1887
02:11:01,499 --> 02:11:03,837
LIAM: What is it?

1888
02:11:03,837 --> 02:11:06,921
TRAVIS: I just think you should go in front of me
here, is all.

1889
02:11:06,921 --> 02:11:09,515
LIAM: You think I should go-- you want me to scout
ahead?

1890
02:11:09,515 --> 02:11:12,773
TRAVIS: Yeah, it looks a little slick, but just go
ahead, just real careful.

1891
02:11:12,773 --> 02:11:14,107
LIAM: All right, I walk past--

1892
02:11:14,107 --> 02:11:17,326
TRAVIS: No, I'm kidding! Jesus, it falls off into
eternity. It's instant death.

1893
02:11:17,326 --> 02:11:18,939
LIAM: What the fuck is wrong with you?!

1894
02:11:18,939 --> 02:11:21,566
(laughter)

1895
02:11:21,566 --> 02:11:22,799
TRAVIS: What, you can't see?

1896
02:11:22,799 --> 02:11:24,445
LIAM: I really can't get a bead on you.

1897
02:11:24,445 --> 02:11:27,005
LAURA: Can you guys keep it down? I can hear you
from here.

1898
02:11:27,005 --> 02:11:36,721
TRAVIS: I grab my earring and I say, I'm on the
right. It is a dead end all the way.

1899
02:11:36,721 --> 02:11:38,366
MARY: Can you see down the hole?

1900
02:11:38,366 --> 02:11:41,127
LAURA: Is it a dead end? So it's a wall in front
of you.

1901
02:11:41,127 --> 02:11:46,910
LIAM: I grasp his giant fucking forearm and lean
out with the dagger, and how far can I see with

1902
02:11:46,910 --> 02:11:48,522
this dim light?

1903
02:11:48,522 --> 02:11:57,364
MATT: You can see that this collapsed portion goes
for about 20, 25 feet, and then the path continues

1904
02:11:57,364 --> 02:12:05,222
beyond that for about another 20, 25 feet, and
then comes to a halt at the opposite side.

1905
02:12:05,222 --> 02:12:08,039
LIAM: So there's a big gap and then there's more
path further.

1906
02:12:08,039 --> 02:12:13,123
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's like 20 feet. Does anybody
climb on anything?

1907
02:12:13,123 --> 02:12:14,960
LAURA: Do you see any openings down there?

1908
02:12:14,960 --> 02:12:17,569
LIAM: You're not here. You don't even know what
we're doing!

1909
02:12:17,569 --> 02:12:18,795
LAURA: Shit.

1910
02:12:18,795 --> 02:12:20,760
TRAVIS: Can't you climb on shit?

1911
02:12:20,760 --> 02:12:25,334
LIAM: I can, but let's see what the others find on
their end, and then we'll figure out if we want to

1912
02:12:25,334 --> 02:12:26,490
deal with this.

1913
02:12:26,490 --> 02:12:32,927
TRAVIS: All right. Hey, Scanlan.

1914
02:12:32,927 --> 02:12:34,094
SAM: Oi.

1915
02:12:34,094 --> 02:12:36,016
TRAVIS: What did you and Zahra find?

1916
02:12:36,016 --> 02:12:37,152
SAM: Well--

1917
02:12:37,152 --> 02:12:38,808
MATT: So as you guys continue down the other
way--

1918
02:12:38,808 --> 02:12:40,273
(laughter)

1919
02:12:40,273 --> 02:12:41,286
WILL: Meanwhile--

1920
02:12:41,286 --> 02:12:42,577
MARY: Back at the ranch.

1921
02:12:42,577 --> 02:12:47,540
MATT: You guys step down this surface, and the
water is pouring down this way, and as you step,

1922
02:12:47,540 --> 02:12:55,026
there's this squishing sound. Not from the water,
but there is, every ten or so feet, there's a

1923
02:12:55,026 --> 02:13:01,676
patch of very thick, mucus-y slime that seems to
cover portions of the wall and portions of the

1924
02:13:01,676 --> 02:13:08,887
floor. You slip a little bit and catch yourself,
and there is a residue that you have to slough off

1925
02:13:08,887 --> 02:13:10,041
your boots.

1926
02:13:10,041 --> 02:13:11,613
WILL: This is never going to be good.

1927
02:13:11,613 --> 02:13:18,001
MATT: Eventually, the tilted tunnel comes to a
very tight spiral staircase that descends further down.

1928
02:13:18,001 --> 02:13:24,268
MARY: Scanlan, tell them I can see some sort of
spiral staircase, but there seems to be a lot of

1929
02:13:24,268 --> 02:13:27,063
goo here, and I'm always wary of goo.

1930
02:13:27,063 --> 02:13:33,294
SAM: Goo is rarely good. We should continue on to
find out.

1931
02:13:33,294 --> 02:13:37,669
MARY: I agree. Should we-- Do we check in with the
others and see?

1932
02:13:37,669 --> 02:13:39,441
WILL: What are you holding your ear for?

1933
02:13:39,441 --> 02:13:45,004
SAM: This is something we all do. I don't know
why, we don't need to do this. It's just a thing.

1934
02:13:45,004 --> 02:13:46,605
TRAVIS: It's like Professor X.

1935
02:13:46,605 --> 02:13:51,014
SAM: You know what? I'm going to try it without.
It might feel weird. (louder) Grog, can you hear

1936
02:13:51,014 --> 02:13:54,195
me? Grog, can you hear me?

1937
02:13:54,195 --> 02:13:55,466
TRAVIS: Oh, now I can hear you.

1938
02:13:55,466 --> 02:13:56,898
SAM: See, it doesn't work that way.

1939
02:13:56,898 --> 02:14:00,093
(laughter)

1940
02:14:00,093 --> 02:14:06,309
SAM: Grog, there's a spiral staircase and some
snot. So we're going to keep going.

1941
02:14:06,309 --> 02:14:09,751
LAURA: Wait, wait. You're going down into the
snotty--

1942
02:14:09,751 --> 02:14:11,218
SAM: Talking to Grog!

1943
02:14:11,218 --> 02:14:13,126
TALIESIN: Let's all go down into the spiral
staircase.

1944
02:14:13,126 --> 02:14:19,458
LIAM: I heard it, as well. We don't want to split
up. Wait there for a minute.

1945
02:14:19,458 --> 02:14:25,270
MARISHA: Is there any moss-snot near Percy and I, in
the middle of the hall?

1946
02:14:25,270 --> 02:14:29,060
MATT: Looking about your general vicinity, very
quickly. At your foot, yeah, there's some.

1947
02:14:29,060 --> 02:14:31,316
MARISHA: Can I do a check-- A snot check?

1948
02:14:31,316 --> 02:14:32,695
MATT: Make a nature check.

1949
02:14:32,695 --> 02:14:34,511
MARISHA: That one failed me.

1950
02:14:34,511 --> 02:14:36,615
WILL: I blame the dice.

1951
02:14:36,615 --> 02:14:41,567
MARISHA: Get out of here. Let's do the wood one.
Oh, that's good. 29.

1952
02:14:41,567 --> 02:14:56,129
MATT: Taking the slickness of it, you were
expecting some sort of secretion, and there is no

1953
02:14:56,129 --> 02:15:04,947
acridness to it. There is nothing about it that
seems to jump out at you as a natural creation by

1954
02:15:04,947 --> 02:15:11,563
a creature. You're not quite sure what the source
of it could be. It could be, somehow, over time,

1955
02:15:11,563 --> 02:15:19,211
slickness that came in through the water, or some
other source. You really, in your experience as a

1956
02:15:19,211 --> 02:15:22,387
druid, have no clear idea as to where this may
have come from.

1957
02:15:22,387 --> 02:15:26,424
MARISHA: So it's not from a creature, but it is
natural?

1958
02:15:26,424 --> 02:15:33,850
MATT: It doesn't appear to be natural. The
viscousness doesn't match anything you've

1959
02:15:33,850 --> 02:15:38,478
encountered from nature, so you're not sure what
the source is. It doesn't appear to be like a

1960
02:15:38,478 --> 02:15:43,397
large snail or something like that. The only
reason you would know that is from your experience

1961
02:15:43,397 --> 02:15:47,688
with subterranean creatures, and studying that in
your books, and as you go through what you've

1962
02:15:47,688 --> 02:15:50,601
researched, nothing jumps out at you.

1963
02:15:50,601 --> 02:15:53,853
TALIESIN: You've milked a lot of snails, and
you've never seen anything like this.

1964
02:15:53,853 --> 02:15:56,870
WILL: (laughs) This is the strangest snail milk
I've ever seen.

1965
02:15:56,870 --> 02:15:59,361
MARY: Does it have any aroma?

1966
02:15:59,361 --> 02:16:05,828
MATT: No, actually. No aroma whatsoever. It is
relatively featureless other than

1967
02:16:05,828 --> 02:16:08,598
its viscous texture.

1968
02:16:08,598 --> 02:16:10,531
SAM: I'm going to pull a Grog and taste it.

1969
02:16:10,531 --> 02:16:14,761
MARISHA: You said there's no acridness?

1970
02:16:14,761 --> 02:16:16,669
MATT: Okay, I need you guys to both-- no, I'm
kidding.

1971
02:16:16,669 --> 02:16:18,343
(laughter)

1972
02:16:18,343 --> 02:16:20,159
MATT: Flavorless.

1973
02:16:20,159 --> 02:16:29,207
MARISHA: Hey, guys. I don't trust this goo. It
creeps me out. Just be careful.

1974
02:16:29,207 --> 02:16:35,279
LIAM: On our end, there's a big chasm over here,
and there is a path on the other side of it, but

1975
02:16:35,279 --> 02:16:36,947
we'd have to get over the chasm.

1976
02:16:36,947 --> 02:16:40,477
MARISHA: I mean, we can manage that, if you think
it's not a dead end.

1977
02:16:40,477 --> 02:16:42,606
LIAM: But you've got a complete stairway over
there with boogers on it.

1978
02:16:42,606 --> 02:16:47,242
TALIESIN: I think we want to head down. Down is
the way to go.

1979
02:16:47,242 --> 02:16:56,493
MATT: They've gone beyond your vision. You don't
see them. The path just continues on in the

1980
02:16:56,493 --> 02:17:01,248
direction they were walking. They have not noticed
you and have not seemingly returned yet.

1981
02:17:01,248 --> 02:17:02,909
TRAVIS: Like a sentry, I just keep looking that
way.

1982
02:17:02,909 --> 02:17:04,361
MARY: I think we should go down.

1983
02:17:04,361 --> 02:17:07,349
WILL: What do you think about a little bit of
light?

1984
02:17:07,349 --> 02:17:13,486
MARY: I can still see in the dark for a little
while. Let's not alert anything of our presence.

1985
02:17:13,486 --> 02:17:17,656
MATT: The two of you are fumbling in complete
darkness right now.

1986
02:17:17,656 --> 02:17:19,607
LAURA: It's really fucking dark.

1987
02:17:19,607 --> 02:17:26,758
MARY: When you cast Light, do you get to control
the amount of light, or is it just--

1988
02:17:26,758 --> 02:17:28,437
MATT: Sure. I don't see why not.

1989
02:17:28,437 --> 02:17:35,898
MARY: All right. I'll cast Light and keep my staff
behind me, a faint candlelight as I continue to

1990
02:17:35,898 --> 02:17:37,220
use my darkvision.

1991
02:17:37,220 --> 02:17:43,924
MATT: So do you guys return with the rest of the
group, and the group continues down the spiral

1992
02:17:43,924 --> 02:17:44,938
staircase?

1993
02:17:44,938 --> 02:17:48,994
LAURA: I want to keep an eye out for any traps or
anything.

1994
02:17:48,994 --> 02:17:55,041
MARISHA: I keep an eye on the goo.

1995
02:17:55,041 --> 02:17:59,433
TRAVIS: I'll stay in the very back and leaving the
Dust of Tracelessness.

1996
02:17:59,433 --> 02:18:05,198
MATT: At this point, Trinket finally comes down
the rest of the staircase, staying back from the

1997
02:18:05,198 --> 02:18:06,648
rest of the group, being stealthy.

1998
02:18:06,648 --> 02:18:12,663
MARY: Trinket, have you ever experienced anything
like this? Do you know anything about this gooey shite?

1999
02:18:12,663 --> 02:18:17,654
MATT: Trinket is actually far behind. You'd have
to back up to converse.

2000
02:18:17,654 --> 02:18:18,972
MARY: All right. Never mind.

2001
02:18:18,972 --> 02:18:22,031
MATT: You guys have quite a large group here,
especially with Kima involved. You have quite the

2002
02:18:22,031 --> 02:18:25,491
party. This is going to be very interesting to see
how it--

2003
02:18:25,491 --> 02:18:26,868
SAM: We're all in the same tunnel now?

2004
02:18:26,868 --> 02:18:30,863
MATT: You guys are all making your way down the
left tunnel, down the spiral staircase that Zahra

2005
02:18:30,863 --> 02:18:36,128
found. So. You progress downward. You're looking
for--?

2006
02:18:36,128 --> 02:18:38,475
LIAM: Traps. I'm looking for traps.

2007
02:18:38,475 --> 02:18:39,667
MATT: Just keeping an eye out?

2008
02:18:39,667 --> 02:18:43,241
LIAM: Yeah, I'm using the light from her thumb or
whatever.

2009
02:18:43,241 --> 02:18:44,335
MARY: My staff.

2010
02:18:44,335 --> 02:18:49,656
LAURA: I want to look for any imperfections in the
stairs that look like they could collapse at any

2011
02:18:49,656 --> 02:18:51,376
time or they could be unsafe.

2012
02:18:51,376 --> 02:18:52,979
MATT: Both of you guys make perception checks with
disadvantage.

2013
02:18:52,979 --> 02:18:54,344
MARISHA: Disadvantage?

2014
02:18:54,344 --> 02:18:55,895
MATT: Very low light.

2015
02:18:55,895 --> 02:19:02,844
LIAM: I don't know why I rolled both at the same
time. 22 for me.

2016
02:19:02,844 --> 02:19:04,706
LAURA: 28 for me.

2017
02:19:04,706 --> 02:19:08,686
TALIESIN: That's a disadvantage roll.

2018
02:19:08,686 --> 02:19:16,687
MATT: Coursing down, what catches your eye is a
little ways down the spiral staircase, there are a

2019
02:19:16,687 --> 02:19:23,085
couple of small, dark, what look like minor
objects that stand out against the rest of the

2020
02:19:23,085 --> 02:19:24,288
stone structure.

2021
02:19:24,288 --> 02:19:26,771
LAURA: Can I crouch down and look at it and see
what it is?

2022
02:19:26,771 --> 02:19:36,369
MATT: They appear to be a couple of dark feathers.
They are beneath an actual layer of slick slime.

2023
02:19:36,369 --> 02:19:38,724
They've been there for a while, but there are two
feathers.

2024
02:19:38,724 --> 02:19:43,607
LAURA: Do they look like the owlbear feathers that
I picked up earlier?

2025
02:19:43,607 --> 02:19:49,050
MATT: No, actually. Owlbear feathers are textured,
with some layers of color, like a natural owl-type

2026
02:19:49,050 --> 02:19:55,907
entity would have. These are jet black. You
recognize it very quickly.

2027
02:19:55,907 --> 02:19:58,245
LAURA: Hey, Keyleth? Have you ever seen feathers
like this?

2028
02:19:58,245 --> 02:19:59,749
MARISHA: Do they appear to be raven feathers?

2029
02:19:59,749 --> 02:20:00,881
MATT: They are raven feathers, yes.

2030
02:20:00,881 --> 02:20:03,075
LAURA: Why were they covered in goo?

2031
02:20:03,075 --> 02:20:07,626
MARISHA: Maybe this was some sort of offering to
the Raven Queen? We might be getting close.

2032
02:20:07,626 --> 02:20:10,429
LAURA: Fuck. The Raven Queen. Right, that makes
sense.

2033
02:20:10,429 --> 02:20:15,295
MARY: Well done.

2034
02:20:15,295 --> 02:20:18,649
LAURA: Thank you. You guys: ravens.

2035
02:20:18,649 --> 02:20:22,345
MARISHA: Ravens, yeah. Onward.

2036
02:20:22,345 --> 02:20:28,197
MATT: Pressing down the spiral staircase. It comes
to another floor beneath the one you just hailed

2037
02:20:28,197 --> 02:20:36,304
from. Go ahead and make another perception check,
you guys going forward. It's the two of you at the front?

2038
02:20:36,304 --> 02:20:37,699
LAURA: Yeah.

2039
02:20:37,699 --> 02:20:39,400
MARY: Do you need more light? You all right?

2040
02:20:39,400 --> 02:20:43,449
LAURA: Oh, was I supposed to still be at
disadvantage?

2041
02:20:43,449 --> 02:20:48,032
MATT: If she's behind you with a very faint bit of
candlelight. You guys have low-light vision, so

2042
02:20:48,032 --> 02:20:53,280
you can still make these checks right now, but
it's at disadvantage because it's very, very limited.

2043
02:20:53,280 --> 02:20:54,282
LIAM: 22.

2044
02:20:54,282 --> 02:20:55,280
LAURA: 26.

2045
02:20:55,280 --> 02:20:58,742
WILL: The twins, baby.

2046
02:20:58,742 --> 02:21:08,147
MATT: All right. As you guys push forward, you
reach out and stop Vax before he takes another

2047
02:21:08,147 --> 02:21:13,127
step as you notice this pathway now, hatchbacking
back in the direction you guys had come from on

2048
02:21:13,127 --> 02:21:19,369
the lower floor. You can see these very, very
thin, about two inch wide slits in the stone walls

2049
02:21:19,369 --> 02:21:21,075
to each side of you.

2050
02:21:21,075 --> 02:21:29,033
LIAM: I'm going to take a closer look at those
things. Do I need to roll anything if I see them

2051
02:21:29,033 --> 02:21:30,828
now, because she's pointed them out?

2052
02:21:30,828 --> 02:21:32,370
MATT: She pointed them out.

2053
02:21:32,370 --> 02:21:39,552
LIAM: I'm going to try to disarm them. They look
like things I've seen before. They look like

2054
02:21:39,552 --> 02:21:41,220
traps. I'm going to try to disarm them.

2055
02:21:41,220 --> 02:21:43,757
MATT: Okay. Go for it.

2056
02:21:43,757 --> 02:21:50,114
MARY: I extend my staff and I raise the light just
a bit so you can see.

2057
02:21:50,114 --> 02:21:54,120
LAURA: Does it look like traps? You want to
perceive them?

2058
02:21:54,120 --> 02:21:58,345
LIAM: What is disarm traps? Dexterity check?

2059
02:21:58,345 --> 02:22:04,605
MATT: This would be using your thieves' tools, and
for this it would be-- I will make this an

2060
02:22:04,605 --> 02:22:06,303
intellect check, with the tools.

2061
02:22:06,303 --> 02:22:07,777
LIAM: An intellect check? Not the thieves' tools?

2062
02:22:07,777 --> 02:22:10,912
MATT: Thieves' tools, proficiency, plus your
intelligence modifier.

2063
02:22:10,912 --> 02:22:12,445
LIAM: Plus the intelligence modifier?

2064
02:22:12,445 --> 02:22:17,442
MATT: Correct, because this is-- you actually have
not encountered this type of trap before, and

2065
02:22:17,442 --> 02:22:19,500
you're trying to ascertain its nature without
setting it off.

2066
02:22:19,500 --> 02:22:23,070
TRAVIS: I need popcorn for this.

2067
02:22:23,070 --> 02:22:25,421
LIAM: 23, then.

2068
02:22:25,421 --> 02:22:26,733
LAURA: Wow, you're really smart.

2069
02:22:26,733 --> 02:22:27,728
MATT: 23?

2070
02:22:27,728 --> 02:22:28,759
LIAM: Yeah.

2071
02:22:28,759 --> 02:22:36,140
MATT: As you step forward and begin to try,
pulling your tools out to inspect the nature of

2072
02:22:36,140 --> 02:22:44,808
these, looking into the dark paths on each side,
there's an instantaneous movement, like a puff of

2073
02:22:44,808 --> 02:22:48,831
air that comes out of each side. I need you to
roll a dexterity save.

2074
02:22:48,831 --> 02:23:00,447
LIAM: Instinctually, I do evasion, if it's
dexterity. I rolled a 12 plus-- 22.

2075
02:23:00,447 --> 02:23:09,505
MATT: 22? All right, you (zoomf) just out of the
way as these two pendulum blades (whoosh) right

2076
02:23:09,505 --> 02:23:14,855
past you, missing you by about a half an inch. And
then (whoosh) disappear and then swing back a

2077
02:23:14,855 --> 02:23:18,004
second time, resetting on opposite sides of the
hallway.

2078
02:23:18,004 --> 02:23:20,481
WILL: We all saw that, right?

2079
02:23:20,481 --> 02:23:24,533
MATT: You all saw that with a very (whoosh,
whoosh).

2080
02:23:24,533 --> 02:23:35,885
LIAM: Scythes in the wall? My nose tickles right
now. I'm going to attempt to take these out and--

2081
02:23:35,885 --> 02:23:37,247
hold on.

2082
02:23:37,247 --> 02:23:40,621
LAURA: Can I perceive around and see if I see any
switches or anything that would turn them off?

2083
02:23:40,621 --> 02:23:41,817
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2084
02:23:41,817 --> 02:23:45,185
LIAM: Thieves' tools to disarm, right?

2085
02:23:45,185 --> 02:23:53,183
MATT: Based on the check you previously made,
these are a little more intricate and you're

2086
02:23:53,183 --> 02:23:58,130
having a hard time finding a way to disarm them.
This would be more of trying to find a mechanism

2087
02:23:58,130 --> 02:24:00,562
in which to disarm them, which she is currently
doing.

2088
02:24:00,562 --> 02:24:02,168
LAURA: This wouldn't be Underdark-y at all, would
it?

2089
02:24:02,168 --> 02:24:03,277
MATT: No.

2090
02:24:03,277 --> 02:24:04,879
LAURA: Then I rolled a ten.

2091
02:24:04,879 --> 02:24:06,249
MATT: Well, this is an investigation check.

2092
02:24:06,249 --> 02:24:08,071
LIAM: Investigation? All right.

2093
02:24:08,071 --> 02:24:10,948
MATT: Ten? You have no idea of the nature of
these.

2094
02:24:10,948 --> 02:24:14,290
LIAM: 13.

2095
02:24:14,290 --> 02:24:21,503
MATT: From this perspective, you have no inkling
or idea as to what the mechanism is, where it's

2096
02:24:21,503 --> 02:24:25,728
hidden, if there is a way to be able to disable
the trigger. You have not encountered this before,

2097
02:24:25,728 --> 02:24:30,396
and it is a little beyond your expertise at the
moment.

2098
02:24:30,396 --> 02:24:38,837
LIAM: Grog, there's giant scythes in the wall or
something and I can't figure out how to take it

2099
02:24:38,837 --> 02:24:43,407
apart. Do you have a weapon that you could jam in
this fucker? Like a throwaway weapon that you

2100
02:24:43,407 --> 02:24:44,535
don't care about?

2101
02:24:44,535 --> 02:24:47,278
TRAVIS: Yeah. I've got three greatswords that are
shit.

2102
02:24:47,278 --> 02:24:51,825
LIAM: Do you want to fucking fuck this knife hole
with a sword?

2103
02:24:51,825 --> 02:24:57,320
SAM: On Vex's suggestion, I'm going to make an
investigation check. 30.

2104
02:24:57,320 --> 02:25:11,395
MATT: So, while you guys are having this
conversation. Scanlan, you step directly up to the

2105
02:25:11,395 --> 02:25:13,348
very edge of where these blades swing from.

2106
02:25:13,348 --> 02:25:17,574
SAM: Kashaw. Watch this.

2107
02:25:17,574 --> 02:25:20,010
(laughter)

2108
02:25:20,010 --> 02:25:22,619
MARY: I think someone has a crush!

2109
02:25:22,619 --> 02:25:30,395
MATT: And you notice that, just glancing ever so
slightly on the inside, there is some sort of a

2110
02:25:30,395 --> 02:25:37,609
latch that is guarded by the blade's embedded
portion. You realize as you put your hand forward,

2111
02:25:37,609 --> 02:25:44,385
you trigger some sort of arcane sensor that is
part of this that causes the blades to (whoosh)

2112
02:25:44,385 --> 02:25:49,774
swing back, and as they swing past you, you hear a
click on the inside of the groove that they swing

2113
02:25:49,774 --> 02:25:57,298
from, and then as they swing a second time to
reset, it gives a louder click sound, almost like

2114
02:25:57,298 --> 02:25:58,308
it resets itself.

2115
02:25:58,308 --> 02:26:02,432
SAM: And how long a period from the blade
swinging, to swinging back. Like a half a second?

2116
02:26:02,432 --> 02:26:06,403
MATT: It's about a second. It's (whoosh, whoosh).

2117
02:26:06,403 --> 02:26:09,018
SAM: So someone needs to reach their little hand
in there and click it.

2118
02:26:09,018 --> 02:26:10,843
LAURA: Someone with little gnome hands, maybe.

2119
02:26:10,843 --> 02:26:12,407
WILL: Impress me.

2120
02:26:12,407 --> 02:26:14,136
SAM: Shit!

2121
02:26:14,136 --> 02:26:15,869
(laughter)

2122
02:26:15,869 --> 02:26:21,299
SAM: All right, watch this, y'alls. I'm going to
try to do it.

2123
02:26:21,299 --> 02:26:23,795
TALIESIN: We get two tries each. It'll be great.

2124
02:26:23,795 --> 02:26:31,758
(laughter)

2125
02:26:31,758 --> 02:26:37,357
MARISHA: Scanlan, would you like a little bit of--
enhancement?

2126
02:26:37,357 --> 02:26:38,839
SAM: Enhancement?

2127
02:26:38,839 --> 02:26:40,678
MARISHA: Natural enhancement, of course.

2128
02:26:40,678 --> 02:26:44,031
SAM: Ooh, I will never say no to enhancement.

2129
02:26:44,031 --> 02:26:51,739
MARISHA: I reach over and I enhance-- what are you
probably going to be using, dexterity?

2130
02:26:51,739 --> 02:26:56,018
SAM: I guess a little shortsword-y blade, I guess,
to get in there? Or I have--

2131
02:26:56,018 --> 02:26:57,857
MARISHA: Is this going to be a sleight of hand
check?

2132
02:26:57,857 --> 02:27:04,581
SAM: I have climbing gear, I have a cube. I have a
flute. What can fit in there?

2133
02:27:04,581 --> 02:27:07,843
MATT: It's about two inches wide, the gap.

2134
02:27:07,843 --> 02:27:09,251
LAURA: So it's wide enough for your fingers.

2135
02:27:09,251 --> 02:27:14,644
MARISHA: I'm going to cast Enhance Ability and
give him Cat's Grace for his dexterity checks.

2136
02:27:14,644 --> 02:27:19,462
MATT: Okay, so you have advantage on
dexterity-based ability checks, currently.

2137
02:27:19,462 --> 02:27:21,909
SAM: Come on. I need these babies to play.

2138
02:27:21,909 --> 02:27:25,905
MARISHA: Don't lose your hand, Scanlan. We don't
have Pike to regenerate it right now.

2139
02:27:25,905 --> 02:27:30,916
SAM: Do you have any tools I can borrow?

2140
02:27:30,916 --> 02:27:32,398
TALIESIN: I have a sword.

2141
02:27:32,398 --> 02:27:35,069
SAM: That shitty sword that you don't care about?

2142
02:27:35,069 --> 02:27:37,229
TALIESIN: It's a very nice sword that I care about
quite a bit.

2143
02:27:37,229 --> 02:27:44,272
SAM: Could I shove a blade in there and jam it,
maybe?

2144
02:27:44,272 --> 02:27:45,703
MATT: You can try to.

2145
02:27:45,703 --> 02:27:49,321
WILL: That's never a good answer. (laughs) You can
try.

2146
02:27:49,321 --> 02:27:56,960
SAM: I'm going to use my Aberration Bane sword.
Shortsword, or whatever it is. I have never used it.

2147
02:27:56,960 --> 02:28:00,704
MARY: (muffled) Don't use that sword. What are you
thinking?

2148
02:28:00,704 --> 02:28:03,279
SAM: All right, I'm going to jam it in there.

2149
02:28:03,279 --> 02:28:09,612
MATT: Are you going to do it?

2150
02:28:09,612 --> 02:28:10,739
SAM: Sure.

2151
02:28:10,739 --> 02:28:15,440
MATT: All right, so you reach over and trigger the
blades, pulling back immediately. (fwoof) They

2152
02:28:15,440 --> 02:28:20,795
pass back. In that one moment, you go for it. Make
a straight dexterity ability check, so roll a d20.

2153
02:28:20,795 --> 02:28:22,632
You have advantage on it.

2154
02:28:22,632 --> 02:28:29,707
SAM: Okay, plus my dexterity, which is zero. So
that's 13.

2155
02:28:29,707 --> 02:28:32,483
MARISHA: Dear god.

2156
02:28:32,483 --> 02:28:41,068
MATT: Once you understand the nature of this, it's
not a very difficult thing to find. You bring the

2157
02:28:41,068 --> 02:28:46,196
blade around in that brief moment, and as you
bring your head into view to inspect the inside,

2158
02:28:46,196 --> 02:28:54,739
you can see there is a slight stone protrusion
from within that groove. You realize the blade

2159
02:28:54,739 --> 02:28:57,638
probably isn't going to help at this point. You
reach over and just (tkch).

2160
02:28:57,638 --> 02:28:58,837
SAM: With my finger?

2161
02:28:58,837 --> 02:29:04,457
MATT: You hit it with your fingers. As you do, you
look quickly over to your right, and the blade is

2162
02:29:04,457 --> 02:29:11,338
already pulling back towards the area where your
head is, and then (creak, crunch) halts, and now

2163
02:29:11,338 --> 02:29:12,909
the blades are just hanging.

2164
02:29:12,909 --> 02:29:15,500
(relieved noises)

2165
02:29:15,500 --> 02:29:19,783
MATT: Locked in place, as the arcane nature of
this trap has held them aloft.

2166
02:29:19,783 --> 02:29:21,513
MARY: That was hot. That was very hot.

2167
02:29:21,513 --> 02:29:23,320
MARISHA: What was your first roll?

2168
02:29:23,320 --> 02:29:24,512
SAM: Thank you. Five.

2169
02:29:24,512 --> 02:29:27,339
MATT: (laughing) That would have been very bad.

2170
02:29:27,339 --> 02:29:29,232
SAM: Thank you for the advantage, Keyleth.

2171
02:29:29,232 --> 02:29:32,835
WILL: That was impressive. If it weren't for Vax,
you'd be my man.

2172
02:29:32,835 --> 02:29:35,894
SAM: (laughing) Oh, Kashaw, you sweet-talker.

2173
02:29:35,894 --> 02:29:37,621
(laughter)

2174
02:29:37,621 --> 02:29:39,163
TALIESIN: I'm in the middle of this.

2175
02:29:39,163 --> 02:29:42,834
SAM: Don't worry, everyone! I've cleared the way.

2176
02:29:42,834 --> 02:29:52,378
LAURA: I pat his little head as I walk through the
blades. Not his cube. Just the top of his head.

2177
02:29:52,378 --> 02:29:59,013
(laughter)

2178
02:29:59,013 --> 02:30:07,824
MATT: So, as you guys continue forward down this
long hallway, heading at a slight upward angle

2179
02:30:07,824 --> 02:30:17,726
now, going against the tilt of this temple. Who's
leading? All right. Pushing forward, it continues

2180
02:30:17,726 --> 02:30:24,247
for about 60 feet. There was a tunnel split over
to the right side, but that has entirely collapsed

2181
02:30:24,247 --> 02:30:29,870
and is just filled with stone and it spills out
partially into the hallway, but it's easy to step

2182
02:30:29,870 --> 02:30:32,941
over and get past. Eventually--

2183
02:30:32,941 --> 02:30:36,160
LIAM: Are you saying it's not blocked, it's just
some rubble and you can step over it?

2184
02:30:36,160 --> 02:30:41,381
MATT: Meaning the passage that you're walking
down, it looks like there was a path that went to

2185
02:30:41,381 --> 02:30:46,234
the right. That whole thing collapsed inward and
is completely impassable.

2186
02:30:46,234 --> 02:30:47,472
LIAM: It's pooped into the passage.

2187
02:30:47,472 --> 02:30:50,549
MATT: It has spilled into the passage, but it's
nothing you can't traverse over.

2188
02:30:50,549 --> 02:30:51,621
LIAM: Thank you.

2189
02:30:51,621 --> 02:30:53,305
WILL: Wow, you paint with words.

2190
02:30:53,305 --> 02:30:54,809
MATT: His vernacular is impressive.

2191
02:30:54,809 --> 02:30:56,474
LIAM: This is my profession.

2192
02:30:56,474 --> 02:30:58,527
(laughter)

2193
02:30:58,527 --> 02:31:00,050
WILL: "It pooped into the passage."

2194
02:31:00,050 --> 02:31:07,230
MATT: Pushing even further forward, the passageway
begins to curve gradually to the left over about

2195
02:31:07,230 --> 02:31:14,431
20 feet, and disappearing around a corner. As you
continue to push forward here, you have moved

2196
02:31:14,431 --> 02:31:18,296
beyond the light, unless Zahra, are you keeping
the same essence of light here to help with his

2197
02:31:18,296 --> 02:31:21,366
vision, you would have to travel up with him to be
able to see around the corner as you move.

2198
02:31:21,366 --> 02:31:25,910
LIAM: Vex, could you tell Zahra to come up another
20 feet or so?

2199
02:31:25,910 --> 02:31:32,034
MARY: Coming. Coming now. So I go up and I stand
next to him.

2200
02:31:32,034 --> 02:31:33,655
LAURA: Walk quietly, dear.

2201
02:31:33,655 --> 02:31:39,807
MATT: As you continue to move forward with him,
the light cascading further down the hall,

2202
02:31:39,807 --> 02:31:47,051
eventually the curvature comes to a halt and you
can see before you a T-intersection of the tunnel.

2203
02:31:47,051 --> 02:31:54,455
Across the way, the tunnel directly across from
you comes to a halt. It just ends about 20 feet

2204
02:31:54,455 --> 02:32:04,152
beyond this intersection. There is a path to the
right and the left. Make a perception check.

2205
02:32:04,152 --> 02:32:05,337
LIAM: 22.

2206
02:32:05,337 --> 02:32:10,860
MATT: Okay. You can see, in a similar fashion to
the tunnel you and Grog first discovered, the

2207
02:32:10,860 --> 02:32:16,623
floor that is the center of this T-intersection
has completely fallen out, as well. There are

2208
02:32:16,623 --> 02:32:21,648
sections of stone that jut out from the edges, but
it appears that this intersection for about a ten

2209
02:32:21,648 --> 02:32:25,572
by ten foot area of the floor is just completely
bottomed out.

2210
02:32:25,572 --> 02:32:30,251
LIAM: So I had a fucked-up passage on the right
behind me. I've got a T ahead of me that goes in

2211
02:32:30,251 --> 02:32:33,470
two directions, but there's a hole in the middle
of the T.

2212
02:32:33,470 --> 02:32:34,568
MATT: Correct.

2213
02:32:34,568 --> 02:32:36,168
LIAM: And there's nothing else?

2214
02:32:36,168 --> 02:32:38,349
MATT: Nothing else visible in the area.

2215
02:32:38,349 --> 02:32:41,433
WILL: How far are they sticking out from the stone
walls?

2216
02:32:41,433 --> 02:32:42,814
MATT: You aren't with them.

2217
02:32:42,814 --> 02:32:44,667
WILL: Oh. That's a good point.

2218
02:32:44,667 --> 02:32:49,282
LIAM: I back up against Zahra, and I say to
everyone else, because she's right next to me,

2219
02:32:49,282 --> 02:32:55,164
we've got a T in the passage here, but there's a
big fucking hole in the way, so we're going to

2220
02:32:55,164 --> 02:33:01,161
need to use our neverending rope, perhaps, or some
means of getting over this hole if we want to go forward.

2221
02:33:01,161 --> 02:33:03,335
TALIESIN: Or into the hole. Maybe it goes
further down.

2222
02:33:03,335 --> 02:33:08,145
MARY: I could use my cloak and I could fly.

2223
02:33:08,145 --> 02:33:09,636
LAURA: You have a-- wait.

2224
02:33:09,636 --> 02:33:15,353
MARY: I have a Cloak of the Bat. And I can use
mine to investigate left or right, whichever side

2225
02:33:15,353 --> 02:33:18,642
you'd like, and I can do a quick investigation and
come back and see.

2226
02:33:18,642 --> 02:33:19,830
LAURA: You can fly?

2227
02:33:19,830 --> 02:33:24,957
MARY: I can. I can also cast flight on all of us,
but that would-- I think, at this point, it might

2228
02:33:24,957 --> 02:33:28,497
be best to do a single investigation.

2229
02:33:28,497 --> 02:33:30,102
LIAM: How strong are you?

2230
02:33:30,102 --> 02:33:35,759
MARY: (laughing) I'm terribly not strong at all.
No, but I can get in and get out.

2231
02:33:35,759 --> 02:33:38,856
LIAM: Can't carry any one person over? Maybe a
gnome?

2232
02:33:38,856 --> 02:33:42,942
LAURA: I could maybe try to leap from the sides of
the hole or something.

2233
02:33:42,942 --> 02:33:48,937
MATT: Where it meets this center area, it's only
about a five-foot step over.

2234
02:33:48,937 --> 02:33:50,076
LAURA and LIAM: Oh.

2235
02:33:50,076 --> 02:33:51,499
MATT: To the other parts of the intersection.

2236
02:33:51,499 --> 02:33:52,995
LAURA: I could totally parkour that.

2237
02:33:52,995 --> 02:33:57,998
MATT: As long as you're not going directly across.
If you're just going catty-corner, it would be a

2238
02:33:57,998 --> 02:34:02,753
relatively easy acrobatics check. Barring you
don't roll a one.

2239
02:34:02,753 --> 02:34:10,154
LIAM: Hold on, I've got this figured out. Hold on.
Hold on, shush. Eenie, meany, miney, mo. Catch a

2240
02:34:10,154 --> 02:34:11,016
tiger by the toe--

2241
02:34:11,016 --> 02:34:12,740
MARY: Do you want to go left, I'll go right?

2242
02:34:12,740 --> 02:34:14,292
LAURA: (whispering) I think we should go down.

2243
02:34:14,292 --> 02:34:16,195
LIAM: Eenie, meany, miney, mo. We go rightwards.

2244
02:34:16,195 --> 02:34:22,818
LAURA: Can we look down? Can we just look down?

2245
02:34:22,818 --> 02:34:28,082
MARY: Does my darkvision extend at all 60 feet
down into the hole to see what's there?

2246
02:34:28,082 --> 02:34:32,051
MATT: All right, as you guys approach, Vax deftly
attempts to leap over to the right side of the

2247
02:34:32,051 --> 02:34:34,352
T-junction. Make an acrobatics check.

2248
02:34:34,352 --> 02:34:38,386
LIAM: That's a 30-something. 30--

2249
02:34:38,386 --> 02:34:39,916
LAURA: Three.

2250
02:34:39,916 --> 02:34:49,479
MATT: Perfect two-toed landing. Just (ta-ding).
And you are immediately met with... a wall. It ends

2251
02:34:49,479 --> 02:34:55,273
to the right. It's almost like across the way and
immediately to the right both just end abruptly.

2252
02:34:55,273 --> 02:34:56,815
LIAM: And there's nothing here?

2253
02:34:56,815 --> 02:34:59,353
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.

2254
02:34:59,353 --> 02:35:01,557
LIAM: 31.

2255
02:35:01,557 --> 02:35:09,095
MATT: You can see there are symbols burned into
what looks to be some sort of a bird head that

2256
02:35:09,095 --> 02:35:15,171
ends in these streaks that are carved into the
rock. Intricately, and done with a very careful hand.

2257
02:35:15,171 --> 02:35:20,034
LIAM: (groans) There's a bunch of bullshit on this
wall and a raven's head, and I don't know what any

2258
02:35:20,034 --> 02:35:21,557
of it fucking means.

2259
02:35:21,557 --> 02:35:24,003
MARY: I use my Cloak of the Bat to fly over and to
read it.

2260
02:35:24,003 --> 02:35:26,802
SAM: Wait, you can read bullshit?

2261
02:35:26,802 --> 02:35:28,305
MARY: I can read bullshit. I have--

2262
02:35:28,305 --> 02:35:30,686
TALIESIN: Oh, I read bullshit.

2263
02:35:30,686 --> 02:35:32,375
MARY: Eyes of the Runekeeper.

2264
02:35:32,375 --> 02:35:40,354
MATT: Okay. It's not a language. It is a symbol.
But you can make a religion check.

2265
02:35:40,354 --> 02:35:44,161
WILL: Are we up there with them now?

2266
02:35:44,161 --> 02:35:46,839
MATT: You guys have stepped up to the edge of the
tunnel.

2267
02:35:46,839 --> 02:35:51,663
LAURA: That little ledge won't support-- I mean,
is it a long hallway that ends abruptly, or is it

2268
02:35:51,663 --> 02:35:52,990
this much space?

2269
02:35:52,990 --> 02:35:56,820
MATT: It's maybe ten, 15 feet beyond the break.

2270
02:35:56,820 --> 02:35:57,962
MARY: 20.

2271
02:35:57,962 --> 02:36:02,908
MATT: 20. This being a tomb of a champion of the
Raven Queen, looking at this, you gather this is

2272
02:36:02,908 --> 02:36:04,974
the symbol of the Raven Queen.

2273
02:36:04,974 --> 02:36:07,157
MARY: That's the symbol of the Raven Queen.

2274
02:36:07,157 --> 02:36:08,639
SAM: Oh, yeah, that makes sense.

2275
02:36:08,639 --> 02:36:12,919
LAURA: I drop something down into-- a rock that I
find-- and drop it down into the hole.

2276
02:36:12,919 --> 02:36:19,043
(long pause)

2277
02:36:19,043 --> 02:36:20,305
MATT: (sploosh)

2278
02:36:20,305 --> 02:36:23,605
LAURA: It's pretty deep, guys.

2279
02:36:23,605 --> 02:36:26,676
LIAM: What do I hear if I knock on the wall that
we're looking at?

2280
02:36:26,676 --> 02:36:29,571
MATT: (quiet knocking) Solid stone.

2281
02:36:29,571 --> 02:36:31,110
LIAM: Doesn't feel hollow.

2282
02:36:31,110 --> 02:36:36,699
LAURA: Can I, since it's only five feet away on
the left, can I look around and see if it looks

2283
02:36:36,699 --> 02:36:40,115
like there's any similar sort of traps or anything
down that hallway?

2284
02:36:40,115 --> 02:36:44,857
MATT: Okay, so you get around and glance around
the edge? To the left tunnel, there is no wall.

2285
02:36:44,857 --> 02:36:53,997
Instead, you're met with a large, ten foot tall,
eight to ten foot wide double set of doors.

2286
02:36:53,997 --> 02:36:55,244
SAM: Doors.

2287
02:36:55,244 --> 02:36:57,908
LIAM: We should just leave.

2288
02:36:57,908 --> 02:37:00,016
(laughter)

2289
02:37:00,016 --> 02:37:01,531
TALIESIN: I'm going to hop over to where the doors
are.

2290
02:37:01,531 --> 02:37:02,646
LAURA: I hop over to the doors, too.

2291
02:37:02,646 --> 02:37:04,027
MATT: Okay. Both of you guys make acrobatics
checks.

2292
02:37:04,027 --> 02:37:06,395
SAM: Jesus, don't fall. (high-pitched noise)

2293
02:37:06,395 --> 02:37:07,625
TALIESIN: 13. 14.

2294
02:37:07,625 --> 02:37:09,286
LAURA: 31.

2295
02:37:09,286 --> 02:37:11,190
MATT: Okay. Yeah, you guys make it across fine.

2296
02:37:11,190 --> 02:37:13,516
MARY: Can I just fly over and land?

2297
02:37:13,516 --> 02:37:20,206
MATT: Kima's getting impatient, and she joins you
guys across that way. She's fine on her roll.

2298
02:37:20,206 --> 02:37:23,261
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll jump over towards the doors as
well.

2299
02:37:23,261 --> 02:37:25,014
MATT: Okay. Acrobatics check.

2300
02:37:25,014 --> 02:37:27,058
WILL: Me, too.

2301
02:37:27,058 --> 02:37:28,574
MARISHA: Oh, yeah. I rolled an 18.

2302
02:37:28,574 --> 02:37:29,819
WILL: Yeah, 20.

2303
02:37:29,819 --> 02:37:32,319
SAM: 15.

2304
02:37:32,319 --> 02:37:33,629
TRAVIS: I rolled a one.

2305
02:37:33,629 --> 02:37:36,325
ALL: No!

2306
02:37:36,325 --> 02:37:37,676
MARISHA: What?

2307
02:37:37,676 --> 02:37:43,092
MATT; So, as all of you start leaping across into
this small tunnel right before the doors, taking a

2308
02:37:43,092 --> 02:37:48,977
moment to inspect it, the final member of the
group right before Trinket, who rolled a two--

2309
02:37:48,977 --> 02:37:51,097
LAURA: You rolled for Trinket?

2310
02:37:51,097 --> 02:37:55,461
MATT: Yeah. Don't worry, Trinket's fine. The one
was the killer.

2311
02:37:55,461 --> 02:37:57,449
LAURA: (gasps) Oh my god.

2312
02:37:57,449 --> 02:38:07,212
MATT: So, you hear a (yelp) as suddenly, that
slime-like mass that you've seen appearing

2313
02:38:07,212 --> 02:38:12,778
throughout the stonework here has also gathered
itself along the edge of this open crevasse in the

2314
02:38:12,778 --> 02:38:18,650
hallway. Your foot hits it and within a moment,
the stones beneath your feet are beneath your feet

2315
02:38:18,650 --> 02:38:21,996
no more, and you find yourself about to plummet
into this--

2316
02:38:21,996 --> 02:38:23,581
LAURA: Can I leap forward and try to grab him?

2317
02:38:23,581 --> 02:38:28,867
MATT: This is happening very quickly. I need you
to go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw to

2318
02:38:28,867 --> 02:38:30,589
see if you can manage to catch the edge.

2319
02:38:30,589 --> 02:38:33,387
TRAVIS: 17.

2320
02:38:33,387 --> 02:38:38,396
MATT: 17? Actually, no, because there is slime on
this, I need you to make it a roll with

2321
02:38:38,396 --> 02:38:39,609
disadvantage.

2322
02:38:39,609 --> 02:38:40,996
MARISHA: Oh no.

2323
02:38:40,996 --> 02:38:42,244
TRAVIS: 11?

2324
02:38:42,244 --> 02:38:48,506
MATT: 11. You (grunts) just catch yourself on the
edge. Your fingers are (shh) sliding off the edge

2325
02:38:48,506 --> 02:38:50,257
right now. You're barely holding on.

2326
02:38:50,257 --> 02:38:56,550
MARISHA: I turn and I cast Grasping Vine from up
here and try and yank him back up.

2327
02:38:56,550 --> 02:38:59,461
LAURA: Trinket turns and puts his claws into
Grog's hand.

2328
02:38:59,461 --> 02:39:00,732
LIAM: Smart bear.

2329
02:39:00,732 --> 02:39:03,365
MATT: Okay. So in a very Scar in The Lion King
moment (whoosh)--

2330
02:39:03,365 --> 02:39:06,562
(laughter)

2331
02:39:06,562 --> 02:39:10,674
TRAVIS: (yells) Just drop me!

2332
02:39:10,674 --> 02:39:16,494
MATT: You do take four points of slashing damage
from the claws that dig into your hands as Trinket

2333
02:39:16,494 --> 02:39:22,676
is holding onto you there. Then a vine streaks out
from the stonework, wraps around you, and pulls

2334
02:39:22,676 --> 02:39:27,682
you up out of Trinket's grasp, slamming into the
ceiling and now holding you aloft before it drops

2335
02:39:27,682 --> 02:39:31,455
you, plopping right into the stonework between the
rest of the party.

2336
02:39:31,455 --> 02:39:33,219
MARISHA: Good to join us, Grog.

2337
02:39:33,219 --> 02:39:34,945
TRAVIS: Yeah, no big deal.

2338
02:39:34,945 --> 02:39:37,120
LAURA: Good to know you can jump at all.

2339
02:39:37,120 --> 02:39:38,932
MARY: Yes, how'd that work for you?

2340
02:39:38,932 --> 02:39:41,348
TRAVIS: Listen, an example of what not to do.

2341
02:39:41,348 --> 02:39:43,358
LAURA: Are your hands okay?

2342
02:39:43,358 --> 02:39:45,811
TRAVIS: Yeah. Should we proceed? What is all this
dilly-dally?

2343
02:39:45,811 --> 02:39:48,322
LAURA: Are the doors locked?

2344
02:39:48,322 --> 02:39:51,244
MATT: You go ahead and push on the door?

2345
02:39:51,244 --> 02:39:54,259
LIAM: Wait! What are you doing over there?

2346
02:39:54,259 --> 02:39:57,017
LAURA: Are there traps on the door? I check for
traps.

2347
02:39:57,017 --> 02:39:59,523
LIAM: Wait up-- okay, go for it.

2348
02:39:59,523 --> 02:40:01,110
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2349
02:40:01,110 --> 02:40:03,153
LIAM: Do me proud!

2350
02:40:03,153 --> 02:40:06,748
LAURA: 16.

2351
02:40:06,748 --> 02:40:17,087
MATT: Okay. Looking over it, there is what looks
to be a locking mechanism on it, but it is not

2352
02:40:17,087 --> 02:40:18,678
currently locked.

2353
02:40:18,678 --> 02:40:20,174
LIAM: Well, that was lucky.

2354
02:40:20,174 --> 02:40:22,122
TALIESIN: Is it?

2355
02:40:22,122 --> 02:40:23,862
LAURA: (door squeaking sound) I push?

2356
02:40:23,862 --> 02:40:29,793
MATT: You push? (thump) It doesn't budge. You have
to put some of your weight behind it to get it to

2357
02:40:29,793 --> 02:40:36,483
shift at all, and it (creak) opens up slightly
into a pitch-black room ahead of you.

2358
02:40:36,483 --> 02:40:37,985
LAURA: Oh good, more darkness.

2359
02:40:37,985 --> 02:40:42,164
MARY: I peek in and, using my darkvision, see what
I can see for 60 feet.

2360
02:40:42,164 --> 02:40:43,732
MATT: Okay, make a perception check.

2361
02:40:43,732 --> 02:40:52,633
LIAM: I'm going to catch up with the ladies and
acrobatics over to them.

2362
02:40:52,633 --> 02:40:57,000
MATT: Go for it.

2363
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:59,111
LIAM: 20-- 33, excuse me.

2364
02:40:59,111 --> 02:41:00,668
MATT: Yeah. Yeah, you (impact). Around the edge--

2365
02:41:00,668 --> 02:41:01,937
MARY: Balls-- ten.

2366
02:41:01,937 --> 02:41:06,014
MATT: Ten? It's hard to make out much detail in
the room; you can see what appears-- the room just

2367
02:41:06,014 --> 02:41:11,240
lays out before you. It seems to open up slightly,
and then even further partway in. It ends on the

2368
02:41:11,240 --> 02:41:17,679
opposite side with curved corners. You can see
what appears to be four pillars in the room that

2369
02:41:17,679 --> 02:41:22,906
meet the floor to the ceiling, the ceiling which
is about 25 feet tall. Most of the tunnels you've

2370
02:41:22,906 --> 02:41:29,572
passed through here are about 15 to 20: this is
about 25 feet tall at its full height. But these

2371
02:41:29,572 --> 02:41:34,890
pillars reach to the ceiling, and there are steps
across the way, what appears to be a raised

2372
02:41:34,890 --> 02:41:39,948
platform. That's the most detail you can make out
of it at this distance-- you'd have to get close.

2373
02:41:39,948 --> 02:41:43,645
MARY: Can't see much. It's a taller ceiling, there
seems to be a platform in the middle and some pillars.

2374
02:41:43,645 --> 02:41:45,533
LAURA: Like a platform like a tomb?

2375
02:41:45,533 --> 02:41:46,997
MARY: No, I can't see, really.

2376
02:41:46,997 --> 02:41:48,265
MARISHA: Like an altar?

2377
02:41:48,265 --> 02:41:52,118
MARY: It's a slightly raised platform, that's--
Grog, can you help? Can you do anything, can you

2378
02:41:52,118 --> 02:41:53,931
see any further than me?

2379
02:41:53,931 --> 02:41:57,569
TRAVIS: Yeah, I come over, and-- 'cause I have 60 feet
of darkvision. Can I try?

2380
02:41:57,569 --> 02:42:00,339
MATT: Yeah, make a Perception check.

2381
02:42:00,339 --> 02:42:01,806
TRAVIS: Nah, I can't see shit.

2382
02:42:01,806 --> 02:42:08,256
SAM: All right, I'll look. I've also got
darkvision, so-- 12.

2383
02:42:08,256 --> 02:42:12,751
MATT: All right, you all come to the same
conclusion-- some sort of raised platform across

2384
02:42:12,751 --> 02:42:13,684
the way.

2385
02:42:13,684 --> 02:42:15,340
MARY: Right, it's sort of a platform, but you
can't really tell what it is.

2386
02:42:15,340 --> 02:42:21,687
SAM: Sort of curved to the back-- I could probably
sketch it for you.

2387
02:42:21,687 --> 02:42:29,275
LAURA: Can I stealth? I want to stealth. And
perceive-- I'm going to, like, step in.

2388
02:42:29,275 --> 02:42:30,744
SAM: Oh, let's just go in there.

2389
02:42:30,744 --> 02:42:35,952
LIAM: Wait a second, hold on a second, this is the
only thing we can do.

2390
02:42:35,952 --> 02:42:37,853
LAURA: 20.

2391
02:42:37,853 --> 02:42:41,469
LIAM: 25.

2392
02:42:41,469 --> 02:42:54,148
MATT: Okay, so you guys stealth into the room. You
sneak in, and you can see now, this slime-type

2393
02:42:54,148 --> 02:42:57,246
substance that you've seen throughout--

2394
02:42:57,246 --> 02:43:00,599
LAURA: Oh! 30, because of Pass without a Trace,
which is still on us.

2395
02:43:00,599 --> 02:43:02,581
LIAM: 30, 35.

2396
02:43:02,581 --> 02:43:11,278
MATT: All right-- it seems to coat most of the
floor and walls of this interior. You guys step

2397
02:43:11,278 --> 02:43:19,817
inside, and with what little bit of light you
have, you see a couple shapes shift across the

2398
02:43:19,817 --> 02:43:21,794
way, behind the platform.

2399
02:43:21,794 --> 02:43:24,010
MARY: That's not good.

2400
02:43:24,010 --> 02:43:26,649
LIAM: (whispers) All right, everybody, get ready
to play.

2401
02:43:26,649 --> 02:43:28,286
TRAVIS: What? Play?

2402
02:43:28,286 --> 02:43:33,445
LAURA: (whispers) There's definitely creatures in
here. I don't know if they're hostile.

2403
02:43:33,445 --> 02:43:36,040
LIAM: I reach down-- are there any rocks or
pebbles or anything on the ground?

2404
02:43:36,040 --> 02:43:38,426
MATT: You find a couple of small pebbles.

2405
02:43:38,426 --> 02:43:39,925
LAURA: (whispers) Can I just shoot an arrow?

2406
02:43:39,925 --> 02:43:42,411
LIAM: I take a pebble, I throw it all the way
towards the platform.

2407
02:43:42,411 --> 02:43:44,029
TRAVIS: Don't waste an arrow.

2408
02:43:44,029 --> 02:43:53,160
MATT: Okay. (plop, plop, plop) As you listen, you
hear a couple of hushed voices (Undercommon).

2409
02:43:53,160 --> 02:43:55,785
Do either of you speak Undercommon?

2410
02:43:55,785 --> 02:43:56,825
LAURA: I do.

2411
02:43:56,825 --> 02:43:58,054
MATT: You do.

2412
02:43:58,054 --> 02:43:59,151
MARY: They're jawas.

2413
02:43:59,151 --> 02:44:01,853
ALL: Ooh!

2414
02:44:01,853 --> 02:44:03,771
MARISHA: Secrets, secrets, secrets.

2415
02:44:03,771 --> 02:44:16,779
SAM: Check out the Geek and Sundry store for
fantastic Critical Role-themed products and

2416
02:44:16,779 --> 02:44:23,031
merchandise! There are shirts and posters for
sale!

2417
02:44:23,031 --> 02:44:34,371
LAURA: (gasps) Ohh! I forgot! Wait! (gasps) Shh!

2418
02:44:34,371 --> 02:44:36,771
LIAM: What's the matter? (whispers) What's the
matter?

2419
02:44:36,771 --> 02:44:44,263
LAURA: (whispers) They know we're here. Obviously,
you threw a fucking rock. They want to fight us--

2420
02:44:44,263 --> 02:44:46,868
whatever it is they're protecting-- this
champion's--

2421
02:44:46,868 --> 02:44:48,148
SAM: They want to bite us?

2422
02:44:48,148 --> 02:44:49,826
TRAVIS: I don't know if anyone can hear you when
you're whispering.

2423
02:44:49,826 --> 02:44:51,397
LAURA: You want me to just yell it out?

2424
02:44:51,397 --> 02:44:52,756
WILL: Well, if they know we're here--

2425
02:44:52,756 --> 02:44:55,758
LAURA: Cool. Hey, there's people on the other
fucking side, and they're going to attack us when

2426
02:44:55,758 --> 02:44:59,533
we walk in here. They're saying to defend his
fucking tomb.

2427
02:44:59,533 --> 02:45:01,028
SAM and WILL: Oh.

2428
02:45:01,028 --> 02:45:02,289
WILL: Right place.

2429
02:45:02,289 --> 02:45:07,923
MARY: So they've been in the dark for a long time,
is that right? I'm going to cast some light as

2430
02:45:07,923 --> 02:45:09,750
bright as I possibly can.

2431
02:45:09,750 --> 02:45:11,031
LAURA: I'm stealthing to the side.

2432
02:45:11,031 --> 02:45:12,482
LIAM: Stealthing to the side.

2433
02:45:12,482 --> 02:45:15,554
WILL: Kashaw jumps up with Zahra; they cast Light
at the same time.

2434
02:45:15,554 --> 02:45:23,772
MATT: Light spell is about as powerful as decent
torchlight, it doesn't become crazy, you know,

2435
02:45:23,772 --> 02:45:25,755
Gandalf-Bridge-of-Khazad-Dum-style.

2436
02:45:25,755 --> 02:45:27,219
WILL: (Gandalf voice) You shall not pass!

2437
02:45:27,219 --> 02:45:32,036
MATT: Yeah. But it does light up the room, and
from what you can see now, immediately across the

2438
02:45:32,036 --> 02:45:41,527
way, atop this platform there is what looks to be
another stone, raised platform or what could be

2439
02:45:41,527 --> 02:45:48,696
considered as some sort of a tomb or stone coffin
that lays atop these stairs on this upper

2440
02:45:48,696 --> 02:45:53,628
platform. There is another humanoid figure that
stands on top, that turns around at the light and

2441
02:45:53,628 --> 02:46:00,146
you can see the light giving that weird, ominous
animal eye-glow whenever the light catches it at

2442
02:46:00,146 --> 02:46:07,394
an awkward angle, the fish face snarling at you,
robes drenched in various liquid and mucus-y fluid

2443
02:46:07,394 --> 02:46:12,882
swish around for a minute as it turns to you, this
fish humanoid clutching this big staff. You can

2444
02:46:12,882 --> 02:46:18,973
see now three other of these fish-like entities
all clamor up from the side, holding onto these

2445
02:46:18,973 --> 02:46:23,678
spears and these weird buckler-type shields on the
side of their arms, and they just

2446
02:46:23,678 --> 02:46:31,545
(loud Undercommon).

2447
02:46:31,545 --> 02:46:33,607
LAURA and MARY: What'd he say?

2448
02:46:33,808 --> 02:46:38,482
LAURA: I want to get up and meet him at a--

2449
02:46:38,482 --> 02:46:50,796
SAM: You can also make donations to our charities
of choice-- Find links to those on Geek and

2450
02:46:50,796 --> 02:46:52,005
Sundry.

2451
02:46:52,005 --> 02:47:03,290
LAURA: I use my earring and I whisper, they're
calling to their master! Something big. I stay

2452
02:47:03,290 --> 02:47:04,501
stealthed.

2453
02:47:04,501 --> 02:47:06,547
MATT: All right. The rest of you--

2454
02:47:06,547 --> 02:47:07,763
MARISHA: Oh, shit--

2455
02:47:07,763 --> 02:47:09,229
LIAM: Stealth, stealth, stealth, stealth,
stealth!

2456
02:47:09,229 --> 02:47:11,183
MATT: Right, we have two of you have stealthed
inside, and you've rolled stealth for this?

2457
02:47:11,183 --> 02:47:12,453
LAURA: Rolled stealth?

2458
02:47:12,453 --> 02:47:14,467
MARY: And we still all have Pass without a Trace
on us?

2459
02:47:14,467 --> 02:47:16,251
LAURA: Yeah, everybody still has Pass Without a
Trace.

2460
02:47:16,251 --> 02:47:17,360
LIAM: Is this new stealth?

2461
02:47:17,360 --> 02:47:20,408
MATT: It doesn't matter, there's two big light
sources in the front of the door. This is going to

2462
02:47:20,408 --> 02:47:21,906
be an initiative roll, folks.

2463
02:47:21,906 --> 02:47:23,244
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2464
02:47:23,244 --> 02:47:31,298
WILL: Look, there's the broken floor!

2465
02:47:31,298 --> 02:47:34,711
MARY: Oh, it's so pretty! There are the pillars!

2466
02:47:34,711 --> 02:47:37,061
SAM: Oh, wow, the detail!

2467
02:47:37,061 --> 02:47:38,556
MATT: Thank you, Dwarven Forge.

2468
02:47:38,556 --> 02:47:42,402
LIAM: Who was this made by?

2469
02:47:42,402 --> 02:47:44,108
MATT: Dwarven Forge, folks.

2470
02:47:44,108 --> 02:47:46,062
MARY and LIAM: Dwarven Forge.

2471
02:47:46,062 --> 02:47:47,236
TALIESIN: That's awesome.

2472
02:47:47,236 --> 02:47:55,106
MATT: All right, so. This door here has been
opened for the moment. The folks that were still

2473
02:47:55,106 --> 02:48:02,340
back in this tunnel here-- We have Zahra and Kash
that walked in and created the light, Trinket is

2474
02:48:02,340 --> 02:48:09,563
still back here at this point-- Scanlan, you're at
the edge of the door, Percy-- And we have Kima in

2475
02:48:09,563 --> 02:48:20,262
the back there, holding up the range. Across the
way we have the one robed individual and these

2476
02:48:20,262 --> 02:48:29,652
other frog-type creatures that have stepped out
from behind here. All righty. So. Let's go ahead

2477
02:48:29,652 --> 02:48:31,990
and get some initiative rolls, folks.

2478
02:48:31,990 --> 02:48:35,318
LAURA: Was I supposed to roll stealth at all on
that?

2479
02:48:35,318 --> 02:48:36,586
MATT: Yeah, if you rolled--

2480
02:48:36,586 --> 02:48:37,458
LAURA: 35.

2481
02:48:37,458 --> 02:48:38,365
MATT: 35.

2482
02:48:38,365 --> 02:48:39,925
WILL: Ew. Do you add it to anything?

2483
02:48:39,925 --> 02:48:41,330
TALIESIN: Yeah, you have an initiative number.

2484
02:48:41,330 --> 02:48:42,765
LIAM: 29 for something.

2485
02:48:42,765 --> 02:48:47,741
SAM: Ooh!

2486
02:48:47,741 --> 02:48:52,007
MATT: All right, so. 25 to 20.

2487
02:48:52,007 --> 02:48:53,797
LAURA: 21.

2488
02:48:53,797 --> 02:48:57,016
MATT: 21. All right.

2489
02:48:57,016 --> 02:48:59,181
MATT: 20 to 15?

2490
02:48:59,181 --> 02:49:00,163
WILL: 19.

2491
02:49:00,163 --> 02:49:01,327
LIAM: 19.

2492
02:49:01,327 --> 02:49:02,532
MATT: Nice.

2493
02:49:02,532 --> 02:49:04,165
TRAVIS: Oh, 17. And 17.

2494
02:49:04,165 --> 02:49:06,962
SAM: 17 for Scanlan.

2495
02:49:06,962 --> 02:49:16,886
MATT: So Grog is 17, Scanlan is 17.

2496
02:49:16,886 --> 02:49:18,467
LIAM: 19 for Vax.

2497
02:49:18,467 --> 02:49:20,175
MATT: Yes, 19 for Vax.

2498
02:49:20,175 --> 02:49:21,698
LIAM: Okay.

2499
02:49:21,698 --> 02:49:23,282
MATT: What'd you roll, five?

2500
02:49:23,282 --> 02:49:24,657
LAURA: Uh huh-- nine, ten--

2501
02:49:24,657 --> 02:49:26,198
MATT: Okay, so that's15 to ten?

2502
02:49:26,198 --> 02:49:27,602
TALIESIN: 12.

2503
02:49:27,602 --> 02:49:31,340
MATT: Percy. Ten to five?

2504
02:49:31,340 --> 02:49:37,431
MARY: (singing along with battle music) Fiiiiive.
(higher) Fiiiiiiiiive!

2505
02:49:37,431 --> 02:49:39,102
MARISHA: Just me and Grog.

2506
02:49:39,102 --> 02:49:40,718
MATT: All right. Keyleth, what'd you get?

2507
02:49:40,718 --> 02:49:41,859
MARISHA: Four.

2508
02:49:41,859 --> 02:49:43,232
MATT: Four.

2509
02:49:43,232 --> 02:49:48,787
MARISHA: Four, yeah! Lucky number four.

2510
02:49:48,787 --> 02:49:53,097
MATT: Oh, man. Kima rolled really bad, too.

2511
02:49:53,097 --> 02:49:55,601
MARY: Kima, you're very quiet.

2512
02:49:55,601 --> 02:50:00,237
MATT: You have nine people in your traveling
group, plus a bear. Trying not to over-complicate

2513
02:50:00,237 --> 02:50:05,612
this. You mass-traveling assholes.

2514
02:50:05,612 --> 02:50:07,677
LIAM: She's very focused and studying our styles.

2515
02:50:07,677 --> 02:50:14,111
MATT: Exactly. All right. All right, so, Vex, you
have the top of the round.

2516
02:50:14,111 --> 02:50:19,637
LAURA: Awesome. I'm going to-- ooh! Is this Sneak
Attack, because I'm stealthed?

2517
02:50:19,637 --> 02:50:23,572
MATT: Technically you would Sneak Attack if you
hit somebody who has not-- you don't know if

2518
02:50:23,572 --> 02:50:24,828
they've seen you or not.

2519
02:50:24,828 --> 02:50:30,295
LAURA: Oh, okay. I'm going to cast Lightning Arrow
on the guy in the middle, 'cause everything within

2520
02:50:30,295 --> 02:50:37,617
ten feet is hit. Oh, you know what? I was using
those little blocks as feet marks-- is that?

2521
02:50:37,617 --> 02:50:40,706
MATT: Yeah, I mean, these are five feet each, so
it would get those two there if you were to

2522
02:50:40,706 --> 02:50:41,780
do it.

2523
02:50:41,780 --> 02:50:44,157
SAM: Is there light? Oh, they lit torches,
right?

2524
02:50:44,157 --> 02:50:46,592
LAURA: It wouldn't get the two guys down--

2525
02:50:46,592 --> 02:50:50,981
MATT: It would get these two there; this guy is
actually beyond the ten-foot radius if you were to

2526
02:50:50,981 --> 02:50:51,872
hit the middle guy.

2527
02:50:51,872 --> 02:50:53,421
LAURA: Okay. So let's do the middle guy and--
yeah.

2528
02:50:53,421 --> 02:50:54,481
MATT: Okay.

2529
02:50:54,481 --> 02:50:58,805
LAURA: Aw man, which one, which one?

2530
02:50:58,805 --> 02:51:00,948
MATT: Go for it.

2531
02:51:00,948 --> 02:51:08,162
LAURA: Let's do this-- That's 30? 30.

2532
02:51:08,162 --> 02:51:09,206
MATT: 30 hits--

2533
02:51:09,206 --> 02:51:10,682
LAURA: No, 28.

2534
02:51:10,682 --> 02:51:18,814
MATT: Pass without a Trace now drops,
by the way. All right, so go ahead and roll damage

2535
02:51:18,814 --> 02:51:20,250
against that guy.

2536
02:51:20,250 --> 02:51:22,391
LAURA: Lightning Arrow is 4d8 lightning damage.

2537
02:51:22,391 --> 02:51:24,667
MATT: Correct. So go ahead and roll that for the
main guy.

2538
02:51:24,667 --> 02:51:36,715
LAURA: Okay. 27 plus sneak attack?

2539
02:51:36,715 --> 02:51:38,853
MATT: Correct.

2540
02:51:38,853 --> 02:51:41,572
LAURA: 29.

2541
02:51:41,572 --> 02:51:54,202
MATT: 29 points of damage. Fantastic, and then it
is 2d8 against the other two if they do not make

2542
02:51:54,202 --> 02:51:59,058
their dexterity saving throw. So what's the DC on
the spell? Well, that's a natural 20--

2543
02:51:59,058 --> 02:52:00,188
LAURA: 15.

2544
02:52:00,188 --> 02:52:01,948
MATT: One of them succeeds, one of them fails.

2545
02:52:01,948 --> 02:52:02,975
LAURA: Okay.

2546
02:52:02,975 --> 02:52:04,128
MATT: So roll 2d8.

2547
02:52:04,128 --> 02:52:07,084
LAURA: 13.

2548
02:52:07,084 --> 02:52:16,553
MATT: This one takes 13 damage, the other takes
six. Okay. So as you step out of the shadows, pull

2549
02:52:16,553 --> 02:52:21,973
back your arrow and release this bolt of blue
lightning energy, it fires across, slams into

2550
02:52:21,973 --> 02:52:29,170
this robed fish-person who shrieks out in pain.
The bolts then scatter off and shoot into two of

2551
02:52:29,170 --> 02:52:33,438
the nearby ones. One of them manages to pull right
behind the pillar and manage to avoid most of the

2552
02:52:33,438 --> 02:52:37,529
impact. The one over here, however, takes the
brunt of it and doubles over in pain, almost

2553
02:52:37,529 --> 02:52:41,073
falling onto its knees. They start croaking back
to each other.

2554
02:52:41,073 --> 02:52:43,544
LAURA: I'm going to move--

2555
02:52:43,544 --> 02:52:44,994
MATT: Do you wish to move yourself or Trinket?

2556
02:52:44,994 --> 02:52:48,246
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to move behind that wall
there.

2557
02:52:48,246 --> 02:52:49,248
MATT: Right here?

2558
02:52:49,248 --> 02:52:50,456
LAURA: Yeah.

2559
02:52:50,456 --> 02:52:52,657
MATT: All right. And Trinket, you want to move--

2560
02:52:52,657 --> 02:52:54,153
LAURA: Trinket is going to--

2561
02:52:54,153 --> 02:52:56,489
MATT: Don't forget you have your pointers, guys.

2562
02:52:56,489 --> 02:53:01,489
LAURA: Move-- I don't know where that is-- move
behind the pillar. Can he get there?

2563
02:53:01,489 --> 02:53:04,475
MATT: His movement speed is 40?

2564
02:53:04,475 --> 02:53:09,003
LAURA: Maybe? Yes.

2565
02:53:09,003 --> 02:53:10,525
MATT: You get there, yeah.

2566
02:53:10,525 --> 02:53:11,702
LAURA: Yeah. Cool.

2567
02:53:11,702 --> 02:53:15,355
MATT: All right. That brings us to Vax.

2568
02:53:15,355 --> 02:53:19,963
LIAM: I dunno if this laser pointer's going to
work, since there's now a wall in the way. I'm

2569
02:53:19,963 --> 02:53:24,441
going to go up the side-- I'm going to hit my heel
against the other heel--

2570
02:53:24,441 --> 02:53:26,478
TRAVIS: I love that you're pointing it at the TV.

2571
02:53:26,478 --> 02:53:27,538
LIAM: Yeah, that's great.

2572
02:53:27,538 --> 02:53:30,254
(laughter)

2573
02:53:30,254 --> 02:53:35,326
LIAM: I'm going to go right to that window right
there.

2574
02:53:35,326 --> 02:53:36,516
MATT: Right here?

2575
02:53:36,516 --> 02:53:42,217
LIAM: Yeah. And you tell me if it's surprise, I
don't know, but I'm going before Fish Guy up on

2576
02:53:42,217 --> 02:53:49,055
the dais. I can't make it work over these walls.
I'm going to chuck three daggers at Fish Guy up

2577
02:53:49,055 --> 02:53:50,703
here on the dais. Through the window.

2578
02:53:50,703 --> 02:53:53,790
MATT: It's not a surprise because they were aware
that there was an aggressive action coming in. But

2579
02:53:53,790 --> 02:53:54,640
you still--

2580
02:53:54,640 --> 02:53:56,233
LIAM: But because I go first I get advantage on
all attacks.

2581
02:53:56,233 --> 02:54:02,550
MATT: Correct, so. So it's three against this guy?

2582
02:54:02,550 --> 02:54:08,127
LIAM: Against guy on the dais, yeah. Is 28?

2583
02:54:08,127 --> 02:54:10,609
MATT: Hits.

2584
02:54:10,609 --> 02:54:18,621
LIAM: Second one is 14, and the third one is 27.

2585
02:54:18,621 --> 02:54:20,036
MATT: All three hit.

2586
02:54:20,036 --> 02:54:26,003
LIAM: All three hit, so the first one we'll do a
sneak attack on, and here we go.

2587
02:54:26,003 --> 02:54:27,290
LAURA: No sneak attack.

2588
02:54:27,290 --> 02:54:41,731
LIAM: Oh, sorry. Advantage. Thank you. 11 for the
first, ten for the second, and eight for the third.

2589
02:54:41,731 --> 02:54:43,708
MATT: This includes sneak attack damage?

2590
02:54:43,708 --> 02:54:45,133
LAURA: I thought you said it didn't get sneak
attack--

2591
02:54:45,133 --> 02:54:47,315
MATT: You have advantage, no no no-- You don't
have surprise.

2592
02:54:47,315 --> 02:54:52,514
LIAM: Right, but because I have advantage, I
automatically-- So yes! Sneak attack on the

2593
02:54:52,514 --> 02:54:54,332
first-- The first one was--

2594
02:54:54,332 --> 02:54:56,770
MATT: It was ten plus whatever the dice roll is.

2595
02:54:56,770 --> 02:55:07,730
LIAM: I rolled a full four, so that's four plus
eight plus-- That's 13, 19, 24, 28, 32, 34--

2596
02:55:07,730 --> 02:55:08,959
LAURA: That's better.

2597
02:55:08,959 --> 02:55:14,067
LIAM: That's the dice, 34, so 68 plus seven is
75.

2598
02:55:14,067 --> 02:55:15,247
MATT: 68?

2599
02:55:15,247 --> 02:55:17,529
LIAM: You double the dice, yeah?

2600
02:55:17,529 --> 02:55:19,416
MATT: If it's a surprise, you-- okay.

2601
02:55:19,416 --> 02:55:25,921
LIAM: Sneak Attack, sorry, I always get this
fucking shit confused. Sorry. So half of that is,

2602
02:55:25,921 --> 02:55:32,385
so 34 plus seven is 41.

2603
02:55:32,385 --> 02:55:33,819
MATT: 41 points of damage.

2604
02:55:33,819 --> 02:55:35,514
LIAM: Always get it confused. Every fucking time.

2605
02:55:35,514 --> 02:55:39,989
MATT: It's all good. So, after the energy from the
arrow is still dissipating from the blast, you've

2606
02:55:39,989 --> 02:55:44,904
already rushed behind through the small space in
the wall and thrown all three daggers, all sinking

2607
02:55:44,904 --> 02:55:52,500
into the body of the robed frog creature, who
doubles over from pain, slamming into the top of

2608
02:55:52,500 --> 02:55:58,510
the stone sarcophagus. In doing so, its hand hits
it and a bunch of black feathers scatter off the

2609
02:55:58,510 --> 02:56:04,882
top and come to rest on the ground at the bottom
of the raised platform. Does that end your turn?

2610
02:56:04,882 --> 02:56:08,935
LIAM: I'd like to use the rest of my movement just
to sink down with my back against the wall, out of

2611
02:56:08,935 --> 02:56:10,315
the way of the window.

2612
02:56:10,315 --> 02:56:16,704
MATT: Okay, so that should be there. All right,
that ends your turn. Kashaw.

2613
02:56:16,704 --> 02:56:20,751
WILL: Okay. How far away are they?

2614
02:56:20,751 --> 02:56:26,511
MATT: They're about 45-ish, 40 to 45 feet.

2615
02:56:26,511 --> 02:56:30,337
LIAM: 50 from whoever's in the lead.

2616
02:56:30,337 --> 02:56:37,007
WILL: I think I'm going to do a-- how close are
the three together? Or, there's four, right?

2617
02:56:37,007 --> 02:56:38,320
MATT: There's four of them, yeah.

2618
02:56:38,320 --> 02:56:42,680
WILL: So those-- how close are the three to the
top there, I don't have a laser pointer.

2619
02:56:42,680 --> 02:56:48,253
MATT: Here? I mean they're all within ten feet of
each other. Ten to 15 feet.

2620
02:56:48,253 --> 02:56:53,704
WILL: I think I am going to do a 5th-level Flame
Strike.

2621
02:56:53,704 --> 02:56:56,060
SAM: Whoa.

2622
02:56:56,060 --> 02:56:59,882
WILL: On-- if they're within ten feet, I can hit
all three of those guys right there.

2623
02:56:59,882 --> 02:57:04,498
MATT: All right, Dexterity saves: fail, fail and
fail. Go ahead and roll some damage.

2624
02:57:04,498 --> 02:57:07,049
WILL: So it's a 20, right?

2625
02:57:07,049 --> 02:57:12,900
MATT: No, you already hit with them, sorry-- I
take that back. You just do straight damage to

2626
02:57:12,900 --> 02:57:16,933
them, and they don't get any reduction in that
because they missed their saves, so you just roll

2627
02:57:16,933 --> 02:57:18,654
the dice and that's how much damage they take.

2628
02:57:18,654 --> 02:57:19,938
WILL: And is it a 20?

2629
02:57:19,938 --> 02:57:28,009
MATT: No, it's 4d6 fire damage and 4d6 radiant
damage, so 8d6 total.

2630
02:57:28,009 --> 02:57:30,275
SAM: You got it.

2631
02:57:30,275 --> 02:57:32,252
WILL: Ah, come on.

2632
02:57:32,252 --> 02:57:36,244
MARISHA: Whoa, that's good!

2633
02:57:36,244 --> 02:57:46,522
WILL: Okay, six, ten, 14, 16, 19, 23, 24.

2634
02:57:46,522 --> 02:57:49,139
MATT: Okay. So.

2635
02:57:49,139 --> 02:57:50,429
WILL: Thank you.

2636
02:57:50,429 --> 02:57:52,812
MATT: Are you going to stay where you are or are
you moving in?

2637
02:57:52,812 --> 02:57:55,741
WILL: No, I'd like to then move in, closer to
Trinket.

2638
02:57:55,741 --> 02:58:02,597
MATT: Okay. So as you're moving by, you grab onto
your holy symbol, look over and concentrate. Your

2639
02:58:02,597 --> 02:58:06,774
eyes go dark black, and one of the feathers that
drifted off the top of the platform comes to rest

2640
02:58:06,774 --> 02:58:12,278
on the ground between the three of them. As the
feather hits the ground it creates this opening of

2641
02:58:12,278 --> 02:58:15,751
blackness behind them as they look down. All of a
sudden the darkness turns to bright, searing light

2642
02:58:15,751 --> 02:58:22,065
as fire and divine energy just slams up from the
ground beneath them into the ceiling, and you just

2643
02:58:22,065 --> 02:58:27,652
hear these three simultaneous screeches. As the
flames die down, there is nothing left where they

2644
02:58:27,652 --> 02:58:28,929
were standing.

2645
02:58:28,929 --> 02:58:30,853
(cheering)

2646
02:58:30,853 --> 02:58:32,955
MARY: Yes, my brother!

2647
02:58:32,955 --> 02:58:47,219
MATT: All right. And that ends your turn. He
doesn't have a turn anymore. At this point in time--

2648
02:58:47,219 --> 02:58:49,659
WILL: I'm sensing something big is on the way

2649
02:58:49,659 --> 02:58:51,103
SAM: Vax! Did you see that?

2650
02:58:51,103 --> 02:58:56,452
LIAM: I'm under cover, I'm pressed to a wall. I
saw a flash of something.

2651
02:58:56,452 --> 02:58:58,206
SAM: Amazing! Oh, sorry, I won't draw attention to
it.

2652
02:58:58,206 --> 02:59:04,355
MATT: There is this echoing mutter, this almost
burbling that seems to rise up behind Kima and

2653
02:59:04,355 --> 02:59:05,901
Percy at this point.

2654
02:59:05,901 --> 02:59:07,279
SAM: Oh, shit.

2655
02:59:07,279 --> 02:59:12,533
MATT: You glance over your shoulder into the
darkness below the collapsed tunnel, and what

2656
02:59:12,533 --> 02:59:18,729
little bit of light you see coming through, you
see something fleshy rise up from underneath. It's

2657
02:59:18,729 --> 02:59:27,197
glistening in places and immediately a cold
shudder crawls down your back as you see a series

2658
02:59:27,197 --> 02:59:32,318
of appendages release, each with a gleaming eye at
the end of each one.

2659
02:59:32,318 --> 02:59:33,500
LAURA: (gasps) No.

2660
02:59:33,500 --> 02:59:34,891
MATT: As one giant eye rises up, it--

2661
02:59:34,891 --> 02:59:38,444
ALL: No!

2662
02:59:38,444 --> 02:59:41,998
(yelling)

2663
02:59:41,998 --> 02:59:45,552
MARISHA: Son of a bitch!

2664
02:59:45,552 --> 02:59:47,526
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

2665
02:59:47,526 --> 02:59:50,434
TALIESIN: No!

2666
02:59:50,434 --> 02:59:52,440
MARISHA: We weren't prepared!

2667
02:59:52,440 --> 02:59:54,230
TALIESIN: Not cool.

2668
02:59:54,230 --> 02:59:56,370
TRAVIS: Happy anniversary, you dicks.

2669
02:59:56,370 --> 02:59:58,281
(laughter)

2670
02:59:58,281 --> 03:00:00,404
LAURA: (muffled) Oh my god!

2671
03:00:00,404 --> 03:00:07,204
MATT: As it rises up and Kima looks over the
shoulder-- "Shit!" It's going to be a beam at

2672
03:00:07,204 --> 03:00:12,023
Kima, a beam at you Percy, and a beam at Grog
since you're visible.

2673
03:00:12,107 --> 03:00:17,951
WILL: (laughs) Shit just got real! And we're all
just, we're stuck in the room now.

2674
03:00:17,951 --> 03:00:27,153
MATT: Against Percy, I need you to make a
dexterity save.

2675
03:00:27,153 --> 03:00:30,360
LIAM: Wake up, everybody!

2676
03:00:30,360 --> 03:00:32,864
TRAVIS: What's going against him right now?

2677
03:00:32,864 --> 03:00:34,419
LAURA: You!

2678
03:00:34,419 --> 03:00:36,507
TALIESIN: That's 19.

2679
03:00:36,507 --> 03:00:45,229
MATT: A 19, okay. Great. A dull green beam arcs past, and
you manage to just duck out of the way-- Slams

2680
03:00:45,229 --> 03:00:51,336
into the stone wall next to you, of which that
stone wall now just turns to dust. Disintegrated

2681
03:00:51,336 --> 03:00:59,802
rock behind you. The one against Kima, see if she
makes her save here-- No, she fails. This beam

2682
03:00:59,802 --> 03:01:05,622
hits Kima square in the chest, and as it does she
doesn't seem to have any physical reaction but she

2683
03:01:05,622 --> 03:01:10,884
begins to back up instinctually from it. You can
see her jaw agape, her eyes wide open, she looks

2684
03:01:10,884 --> 03:01:18,512
like she is filled with the dread of the ages. And
the third beam going towards Grog, have to reroll

2685
03:01:18,512 --> 03:01:22,010
that, need you to make a dexterity save, Grog.

2686
03:01:22,010 --> 03:01:25,228
TRAVIS: I'm not raging or anything. 19.

2687
03:01:25,228 --> 03:01:35,099
MATT: 19, great. A strangely quicksilver-like
beam strikes you center in the chest. It hits you

2688
03:01:35,099 --> 03:01:40,903
and you feel the muscles around your chest begin
to seize up and crack into dust like the actual

2689
03:01:40,903 --> 03:01:50,484
flesh is turning to a slightly hardened stone but
you flex and resist the effect, the petrification

2690
03:01:50,484 --> 03:01:52,739
not beginning to take hold within your body.

2691
03:01:52,739 --> 03:01:54,198
TRAVIS: Petrification--

2692
03:01:54,198 --> 03:01:59,140
LAURA: I don't remember all the things, I don't
remember all the things! Oh no!

2693
03:01:59,140 --> 03:02:02,109
MARISHA: It's everything-- Yeah, they've got fear,
disintegration--

2694
03:02:02,109 --> 03:02:06,541
TALIESIN: It is the burrito supreme of creatures.
It comes with everything!

2695
03:02:06,541 --> 03:02:08,603
WILL: And fries and a coke!

2696
03:02:08,603 --> 03:02:14,207
TALIESIN: There's a fuck-you beam too, there's
like literally a fuck-you beam

2697
03:02:14,207 --> 03:02:17,656
WILL: Oh my god, you're going into a special
section of your book. That's never good.

2698
03:02:17,656 --> 03:02:20,826
MARISHA: I've got a list, I've got a fiends book.

2699
03:02:20,826 --> 03:02:22,584
WILL: Oh my god, of course you do.

2700
03:02:22,584 --> 03:02:24,247
LIAM: Ah, he's moving!

2701
03:02:24,247 --> 03:02:32,898
MATT: So as it turns up, its beam striking you,
after all the beams hit, it turns around and

2702
03:02:32,898 --> 03:02:37,396
(incomprehensible growling). Speaking in a
language you don't understand unless one of you

2703
03:02:37,396 --> 03:02:39,227
speaks Deep Speech.

2704
03:02:39,227 --> 03:02:42,976
SAM: Deep Speech? I speak Common!

2705
03:02:42,976 --> 03:02:44,680
WILL: Yeah, is that the same as Giant?

2706
03:02:44,680 --> 03:02:48,455
SAM: And Gnomish!

2707
03:02:48,455 --> 03:02:51,723
TRAVIS: Is that above us or is that?

2708
03:02:51,723 --> 03:02:57,058
MATT: He's right above you, he's just hovering
right over your heads. And it stops right above

2709
03:02:57,058 --> 03:02:59,542
you, Grog. That ends its turn.

2710
03:02:59,542 --> 03:03:16,084
TRAVIS: Don't you fucking shoot that shit at me!
And I go into a frenzied rage! And I will-- I'm

2711
03:03:16,084 --> 03:03:22,816
going to just attack it regular, with Craven Edge.
Just on this one, 'cause I don't know what hits yet.

2712
03:03:22,816 --> 03:03:24,671
MATT: You get two attacks.

2713
03:03:24,671 --> 03:03:29,497
TRAVIS: Yep. Terrible. 12.

2714
03:03:29,497 --> 03:03:33,363
MATT: 12. You go to swing and you miss entirely.

2715
03:03:33,363 --> 03:03:35,855
TRAVIS: 17.

2716
03:03:35,855 --> 03:03:41,795
MATT: You swing with a 17 and once again, just in
your fury and anger in it flying overhead and the

2717
03:03:41,795 --> 03:03:47,414
little bit of intensity of its reveal, you just
can't seem to find purchase on its body.

2718
03:03:47,414 --> 03:03:49,447
TRAVIS: 17 does not hit, FYI.

2719
03:03:49,447 --> 03:03:51,094
LAURA: Got it, got it, got it.

2720
03:03:51,094 --> 03:03:53,403
MATT: All right, Grog, you want to move or you
going to stay where you are?

2721
03:03:53,403 --> 03:04:00,968
TRAVIS: I am going to move like the sweet dewdrop
that I am, and haul ass behind-- I've got a little

2722
03:04:00,968 --> 03:04:04,261
pointer. I'm going to move behind that column.

2723
03:04:04,261 --> 03:04:06,546
MATT: Okay, you can get there fine.

2724
03:04:06,546 --> 03:04:11,580
TRAVIS: Yeah. Just put it between me and him.
That'll end my turn.

2725
03:04:11,580 --> 03:04:15,428
MATT: Okay. As you rush past, it's going to
go ahead and use a reaction to make a bite attack

2726
03:04:15,428 --> 03:04:20,914
at you as you speed beneath it. Oh, that is a 24
to hit.

2727
03:04:20,914 --> 03:04:22,223
TRAVIS: That hits.

2728
03:04:22,223 --> 03:04:26,913
MATT: You take 14 points of piercing damage,
reduced to seven. As its teeth just reach out and

2729
03:04:26,913 --> 03:04:31,910
bite towards you, streaking across your shoulder as
you push out of the pain, continuing forward. All

2730
03:04:31,910 --> 03:04:34,070
right, that ends Grog's turn, Scanlan, you're up.

2731
03:04:34,070 --> 03:04:37,770
SAM: Jesus. Can it see me? I'm right under it.

2732
03:04:37,770 --> 03:04:40,292
MATT: It doesn't seem to notice you at the moment,
no.

2733
03:04:40,292 --> 03:04:41,778
SAM: Okay.

2734
03:04:41,778 --> 03:04:46,413
MATT: It seems to be intent, looking towards Zahra
and Kashaw at the moment, as they are immediately

2735
03:04:46,413 --> 03:04:48,084
in front of it.

2736
03:04:48,084 --> 03:04:55,071
SAM: I'm going to attempt to use my Wand of Fire--
oh no, no, that's a bad idea. I'm going to use my

2737
03:04:55,071 --> 03:05:02,410
Lightning Bolt! Lightning Bolt on it. Lightning
Bolt. 'Cause I'm right under it, right? So it'll

2738
03:05:02,410 --> 03:05:04,063
just go straight up.

2739
03:05:04,063 --> 03:05:07,715
MATT: You are, correct. Ah, it fails its save.
That's an 11.

2740
03:05:07,715 --> 03:05:10,946
SAM: Okay. So I can roll for something?

2741
03:05:10,946 --> 03:05:14,072
MATT: Yeah, go ahead and roll 8d6 points of
lightning damage against it, because you're doing

2742
03:05:14,072 --> 03:05:15,402
it at a level three?

2743
03:05:15,402 --> 03:05:16,431
SAM: Yes, please.

2744
03:05:16,431 --> 03:05:18,299
MATT: So yeah, so 8d6 lightning damage.

2745
03:05:18,299 --> 03:05:19,941
TALIESIN: That's really good.

2746
03:05:19,941 --> 03:05:23,941
SAM: 30!

2747
03:05:23,941 --> 03:05:30,893
MATT: 30 points of damage. Nice! So as you release
this bolt of energy, you guys see this flash of

2748
03:05:30,893 --> 03:05:37,027
blue light in the distance as the bolt slams up
into the creature from underneath. All its eyes

2749
03:05:37,027 --> 03:05:40,884
whip around in your direction for a second, before
looking around all the areas around it. It's still

2750
03:05:40,884 --> 03:05:45,490
focused intently in your guys' direction. Do you
wish to move or do you want to stay where you are?

2751
03:05:45,490 --> 03:05:49,841
SAM: Well, I assume it sees me now, but I'll
slowly back away.

2752
03:05:49,841 --> 03:05:54,796
MATT: Okay, Percy's in your way so you have to
back over in this direction.

2753
03:05:54,796 --> 03:05:58,888
SAM: Does it kill me while I move?

2754
03:05:58,888 --> 03:06:01,095
MATT: No, it's already made its reaction.

2755
03:06:01,095 --> 03:06:08,533
SAM: And then I will turn to Zahra and I will sing
to her to inspire her. I'll sing: (sings) Zahra, a

2756
03:06:08,533 --> 03:06:22,354
rainbow! Zahra, a sunrise! Zahra the moon to wear!
That's not good enough, no, not good enough,

2757
03:06:22,354 --> 03:06:23,810
not for Zahra!

2758
03:06:23,810 --> 03:06:25,219
(laughter)

2759
03:06:25,219 --> 03:06:27,510
MATT: Okay, you take a d10 inspiration die, so
keep that on hand.

2760
03:06:27,510 --> 03:06:30,423
LIAM: I always like the bail out at the end.

2761
03:06:30,423 --> 03:06:34,342
MATT: It's the best. All right, that ends your
turn. Percy, you're up.

2762
03:06:34,342 --> 03:06:42,679
TALIESIN: Oh boy! First thing I'm going to do-- So
it took its reaction, so does that mean if I run

2763
03:06:42,679 --> 03:06:46,461
around it it can't take an attack of opportunity
on me or is--

2764
03:06:46,461 --> 03:06:50,936
MATT: Correct, yes. If you wanted to move past it,
yes, you could.

2765
03:06:50,936 --> 03:06:55,813
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and run past it, full
speed, yeah.

2766
03:06:55,813 --> 03:06:58,461
MATT: There you go, that's about as far as you can
get in a direct line.

2767
03:06:58,461 --> 03:07:11,290
TALIESIN: Okay, that will do. I'm going to--
What's the smart play here?

2768
03:07:11,290 --> 03:07:14,308
MATT: Keep it going, Percy, what are you going to
do?

2769
03:07:14,308 --> 03:07:24,411
TALIESIN: Yeah, sorry, I'm going to cast Hex on
the little fish creature. I know that sounds odd,

2770
03:07:24,411 --> 03:07:25,945
but that's what I'm doing.

2771
03:07:25,945 --> 03:07:34,613
MATT: Actually, Lewis, can you hand me that little
template there? The post. To the left of it.

2772
03:07:34,613 --> 03:07:36,995
(offscreen clatter)

2773
03:07:36,995 --> 03:07:38,293
SAM: That worked.

2774
03:07:38,293 --> 03:07:44,031
(laughter)

2775
03:07:44,031 --> 03:07:55,648
MATT: So, Percy, as you go to cast the spell, you
release the incantation. Nothing happens.

2776
03:07:55,648 --> 03:08:06,420
TALIESIN: That's fine. I'm going to take a trick
shot at the beholder.

2777
03:08:06,420 --> 03:08:07,711
MATT: Okay.

2778
03:08:07,711 --> 03:08:22,179
TALIESIN: So I'm going to shoot for the head, that
tends to go well. Oh, thank god. No, that's going

2779
03:08:22,179 --> 03:08:24,818
to miss. That's a 15.

2780
03:08:24,818 --> 03:08:29,890
MATT: 15. Unfortunately, in your sudden fear of
realizing the spell not happening, you go to fire

2781
03:08:29,890 --> 03:08:32,947
and it just ricochets off the stone.

2782
03:08:32,947 --> 03:08:37,695
TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to take another
shot. Same thing. Headshot.

2783
03:08:37,695 --> 03:08:39,981
MATT: Okay.

2784
03:08:39,981 --> 03:08:44,377
TALIESIN: That's a little better. 20

2785
03:08:44,377 --> 03:08:45,427
MATT: 20 does hit.

2786
03:08:45,427 --> 03:08:55,332
TALIESIN: 20 hits, so that's-- God damn it, I'm
rolling really poorly. That's eight points of

2787
03:08:55,332 --> 03:08:58,647
piercing damage. Plus he has to make a
constitution save.

2788
03:08:58,647 --> 03:09:03,272
MATT: Okay, or?

2789
03:09:03,272 --> 03:09:10,285
TALIESIN: Or, if he missed his constitution save,
that means he's disadvantage on attacks until the

2790
03:09:10,285 --> 03:09:12,993
end of his turn.

2791
03:09:12,993 --> 03:09:16,350
MATT: Good to know. The rays don't make attacks so
the only thing that it would affect is his bite.

2792
03:09:16,350 --> 03:09:18,714
TALIESIN: Okay. That's--

2793
03:09:18,714 --> 03:09:21,147
LAURA: Good to know.

2794
03:09:21,147 --> 03:09:24,798
MATT: It just looks at you and the ray hits you
and it's your attempt to try to get out of the

2795
03:09:24,798 --> 03:09:26,520
way. That's how it works.

2796
03:09:26,520 --> 03:09:42,436
TALIESIN: Good fucking god! Then just, I suppose,
with my last attack I'm going to shoot that fish

2797
03:09:42,436 --> 03:09:44,488
person, just 'cause we should really clear the
board.

2798
03:09:44,488 --> 03:09:47,251
MATT: Okay, go for it.

2799
03:09:47,251 --> 03:09:50,908
TALIESIN: That's better! 20-- 31.

2800
03:09:50,908 --> 03:09:53,434
MATT: 31, that hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

2801
03:09:53,434 --> 03:09:55,152
TALIESIN: (blows raspberry) Eight.

2802
03:09:55,152 --> 03:10:01,429
MATT: Eight damage? So as you turn around the
third shot fires, it slams into the fish

2803
03:10:01,429 --> 03:10:07,911
creature. You see, like, blowing part of its neck
out, it (choking grunt). It's pretty heavily hurt,

2804
03:10:07,911 --> 03:10:12,169
but still standing. It looks to be almost like,
with the pain it's withstanding as it's looking up

2805
03:10:12,169 --> 03:10:18,572
at this, it's reverent and raising its spear
toward the Beholder, like (Undercommon chanting).

2806
03:10:18,572 --> 03:10:21,445
LIAM: Four more years!

2807
03:10:21,445 --> 03:10:25,318
(laughter)

2808
03:10:25,318 --> 03:10:29,281
MATT: All right, that's Percy. It is now that
creature's turn.

2809
03:10:29,281 --> 03:10:33,749
WILL: We're going to build a fish cage.
Vasselheim's going to pay for it.

2810
03:10:33,749 --> 03:10:40,982
LIAM: It's going to be 'uge.

2811
03:10:40,982 --> 03:10:46,054
MARY: 'Uge. Tiny hands, 'uge.

2812
03:10:46,054 --> 03:10:50,463
MATT: All right, six. It's going to move up to you
after you shot it. Percy, it's going to make an

2813
03:10:50,463 --> 03:10:56,014
attack with its spear on you with both hands. It
pulls up and goes towards you, its big old fish

2814
03:10:56,014 --> 03:11:01,637
mouth snapping. Oh! That's going to be a 21?

2815
03:11:01,637 --> 03:11:09,952
TALIESIN: I'm going to take the hit.

2816
03:11:09,952 --> 03:11:14,783
MATT: Okay. As it jams the spear into your side,
it hits your shoulder and just streaks off,

2817
03:11:14,783 --> 03:11:21,659
tearing into the flesh a little bit, but it's not
too bad. You end up taking-- okay, that's nine

2818
03:11:21,659 --> 03:11:29,314
points of piercing damage. All right! That ends
its turn. Keyleth, you're up.

2819
03:11:29,314 --> 03:11:36,230
MARISHA: Okay, first things first, I'm going to--

2820
03:11:36,230 --> 03:11:39,795
MATT: Actually, sorry. Before the end of your
turn, out of frustration at being shot, it's going

2821
03:11:39,795 --> 03:11:43,703
to use one of its action points to shoot-- I'm
sorry, one of its legendary actions to shoot

2822
03:11:43,703 --> 03:11:47,839
another eye ray at random, at the end of Percy's
turn.

2823
03:11:47,839 --> 03:11:50,019
MARISHA: Where's that laser pointer?

2824
03:11:50,019 --> 03:11:51,787
TALIESIN: It's going to shoot at me, isn't it?

2825
03:11:51,787 --> 03:12:02,912
MATT: Yes, it is going to shoot at you, because
you were the one that just shot at it. No, it's

2826
03:12:02,912 --> 03:12:06,607
not going to shoot you, because you are in its--
it would absolve its ray, so it's not going to

2827
03:12:06,607 --> 03:12:08,786
shoot you, it's going to fire behind it, instead,
at Kima.

2828
03:12:08,786 --> 03:12:13,400
Okay.

2829
03:12:13,400 --> 03:12:15,588
MARISHA: What? Come on--

2830
03:12:15,588 --> 03:12:24,728
MATT: Kima's strength save... Natural two. So
that's going to be the telekinetic ray, it's going

2831
03:12:24,728 --> 03:12:32,998
to move it 30 feet in any direction. It's going to
lift Kima above this hole and just drop her. Kima,

2832
03:12:32,998 --> 03:12:40,556
unable to do anything at this point, struck with
fear from the previous ray and is nowhere near the

2833
03:12:40,556 --> 03:12:45,050
edge, is just thrown off and plummets into the
darkness below, where the beholder originally

2834
03:12:45,050 --> 03:12:51,391
emerged. You just hear her scream (screams) as the
echo continues past. You don't even hear an

2835
03:12:51,391 --> 03:12:54,899
impact. That sucked.

2836
03:12:54,899 --> 03:12:57,012
MARY: Oh my god.

2837
03:12:57,012 --> 03:12:59,778
MATT: Now it's your turn, Keyleth.

2838
03:12:59,778 --> 03:13:07,386
MARISHA: Oh my god-- do I still have enough time
to do a bonus reaction to try and save her with a

2839
03:13:07,386 --> 03:13:09,450
Grasping Vine, or is she gone?

2840
03:13:09,450 --> 03:13:20,458
MATT: I will say go ahead and roll a dexterity
check. Just a straight dexterity check.

2841
03:13:20,458 --> 03:13:24,571
MARISHA: (groans) Straight dexterity?

2842
03:13:24,571 --> 03:13:29,789
MATT: As you look over--

2843
03:13:29,789 --> 03:13:31,398
MARISHA: I rolled a natural two.

2844
03:13:31,398 --> 03:13:33,262
MATT: --before you have an opportunity to get
that thought in your head,

2845
03:13:33,262 --> 03:13:34,698
she vanishes into the darkness.

2846
03:13:34,698 --> 03:13:36,648
SAM: (laughing nervously) Oh shit, Kima just
died.

2847
03:13:36,648 --> 03:13:38,858
WILL: (laughing) Why are you laughing!? Holy
shit!

2848
03:13:38,858 --> 03:13:43,219
TALIESIN: She may not be dead. She may just be
really, really wet and broken.

2849
03:13:43,219 --> 03:13:44,750
MARY: She landed in the slime.

2850
03:13:44,750 --> 03:13:47,499
SAM: Yeah! Yeah, maybe it's soft and cushy!

2851
03:13:47,499 --> 03:13:51,695
MATT: What are you doing, Keyleth?

2852
03:13:51,695 --> 03:13:57,927
MARISHA: I'm going to try and move behind him so--
I'm not, like, in his eye cone, am I?

2853
03:13:57,927 --> 03:14:00,384
MATT: Right now you're not, no. So you can move--

2854
03:14:00,384 --> 03:14:09,283
MARISHA: No no, behind him a bit-- I'm going to
cast Blight at fifth level on him.

2855
03:14:09,283 --> 03:14:10,562
MATT: Okay.

2856
03:14:10,562 --> 03:14:17,252
MARISHA: Oh, god. I'm so afraid. So it's going to
do 9d8 damage-- anyone give me some d8s? d8 me.

2857
03:14:17,252 --> 03:14:24,224
MATT: Okay, constitution saving throw--

2858
03:14:24,224 --> 03:14:28,036
MARISHA: Fail it, motherfucker.

2859
03:14:28,036 --> 03:14:31,022
MATT: 11, so yeah. Full damage.

2860
03:14:31,022 --> 03:14:50,143
MARISHA: Yeah! All right, okay. Eight, ten, 15,
17. So, four more. These were at 17-- That

2861
03:14:50,143 --> 03:15:04,144
could've been better. What'd I say, 17? Plus
another seven, this is 33 damage.

2862
03:15:04,144 --> 03:15:09,415
MATT: 33 damage. Nice. So as you look up, you
channel your spell energy into the essence of

2863
03:15:09,415 --> 03:15:17,103
withering life force and you can see a portion of
its back, the slime dripping from its form, the

2864
03:15:17,103 --> 03:15:22,836
flesh shrinks up and shrivels, and it shrieks out.
Some of the eyestalks quiver and look in the

2865
03:15:22,836 --> 03:15:25,370
direction of where you are, and some glance down
and see you.

2866
03:15:25,370 --> 03:15:31,284
MARISHA: So we established that this moss-slime
isn't natural, it's not like a plant.

2867
03:15:31,284 --> 03:15:32,794
MATT: Correct.

2868
03:15:32,794 --> 03:15:37,293
MARISHA: And now I'm going to use my bonus action
to go into earth elemental form.

2869
03:15:37,293 --> 03:15:40,382
MATT: Return to form.

2870
03:15:40,382 --> 03:15:43,344
MARISHA: Yes. This worked last time.

2871
03:15:43,344 --> 03:15:47,317
MARY: What does that mean, Keyleth?

2872
03:15:47,317 --> 03:15:49,332
TRAVIS: She turns into a giant rock monster.

2873
03:15:49,332 --> 03:16:02,780
MATT: That ends your turn. At the end of your turn
it's going to use another legendary action to fire

2874
03:16:02,780 --> 03:16:11,707
another ray. This one is going to be-- this is
going to be at Scanlan, as it's the one that's

2875
03:16:11,707 --> 03:16:14,382
clear and behind it. It sees you transform into
earth elemental form--

2876
03:16:14,382 --> 03:16:17,752
MARISHA: Do I still have enough movement to where
I can, like, go underground? Can I do that, or no?

2877
03:16:17,752 --> 03:16:23,190
MATT: You can travel into earth. You cannot travel
into, like, solid stone, carved stone.

2878
03:16:23,190 --> 03:16:25,577
MARISHA: Is there any earth around?

2879
03:16:25,577 --> 03:16:31,304
MATT: Not immediately visible. Actually, there is,
in the wall that it disintegrated when it tried to

2880
03:16:31,304 --> 03:16:35,036
shoot Percy, so yeah, right up in here there would
be.

2881
03:16:35,036 --> 03:16:37,760
MARISHA: Can I, like, Homer Simpson (slurps) into
the wall?

2882
03:16:37,760 --> 03:16:44,027
MATT: Okay. (slurps) You vanish into the wall
there. But you can only emerge from that same spot.

2883
03:16:44,027 --> 03:16:45,427
MARISHA: Okay.

2884
03:16:45,427 --> 03:16:51,857
MATT: It's the only exposed earth in the vicinity.
But you are in the wall. Okay! It's going-- and

2885
03:16:51,857 --> 03:16:55,332
since you've disappeared, it goes ahead and takes
the ray shot at Scanlan. Scanlan, I need you to go

2886
03:16:55,332 --> 03:16:58,600
ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.

2887
03:16:58,600 --> 03:17:00,326
SAM: Is this a spell?

2888
03:17:00,326 --> 03:17:02,905
MATT: No, this is not a spell.

2889
03:17:02,905 --> 03:17:06,758
SAM: Can I use Cutting Words on it?

2890
03:17:06,758 --> 03:17:08,619
MATT: It is not an actual attack--

2891
03:17:08,619 --> 03:17:09,773
SAM: Oh, it just happens.

2892
03:17:09,773 --> 03:17:11,683
MATT: But you can use Cutting Words to reduce the
damage if you want to.

2893
03:17:11,683 --> 03:17:13,834
SAM: Well, then, I'll just make my what, dexterity
sa--

2894
03:17:13,834 --> 03:17:15,902
MATT: Your dexterity save, yes.

2895
03:17:15,902 --> 03:17:19,844
SAM: Hmm, yeah, great. Five?

2896
03:17:19,844 --> 03:17:21,460
MATT: Five.

2897
03:17:21,460 --> 03:17:25,281
MARISHA: To be fair, I think I still have your
Enhance Ability up--

2898
03:17:25,281 --> 03:17:29,866
MATT: Ability checks. Ability checks, not saving
throws. So you can see one eyestalk that was

2899
03:17:29,866 --> 03:17:36,957
looking for Keyleth hones in on you and this eye
has no iris, just a deep, thick, black pupil. And

2900
03:17:36,957 --> 03:17:42,283
a streaking beam, it sounds like a shrieking
voice, just (shrieks) streaks out and slams into

2901
03:17:42,283 --> 03:17:47,240
you, this black, solid beam. You take 55 points of
necrotic damage.

2902
03:17:47,240 --> 03:17:49,354
LAURA: (gasps) Oh my god.

2903
03:17:49,354 --> 03:17:52,238
SAM: Yeah. Sure, sure, yeah. Yeah.

2904
03:17:52,238 --> 03:17:55,265
TALIESIN: I hate beholders so much.

2905
03:17:55,265 --> 03:17:57,566
MATT: That ends Keyleth's turn. Kima's turn.

2906
03:17:57,566 --> 03:18:01,384
LAURA: Is she unconscious or is she awake?

2907
03:18:01,384 --> 03:18:03,157
MATT: We're going to find out.

2908
03:18:03,157 --> 03:18:05,083
TALIESIN: She's possibly still falling, it could
be a really deep hole.

2909
03:18:05,083 --> 03:18:07,087
WILL: She's like, 'Damn, this is taking forever.'

2910
03:18:07,087 --> 03:18:09,733
MATT: Does not make the acrobatics check--

2911
03:18:09,733 --> 03:18:11,236
LAURA: Oh no!

2912
03:18:11,236 --> 03:18:20,725
LIAM: Look at this guy, he's cold as the
universe.

2913
03:18:20,725 --> 03:18:24,912
TALIESIN: Doing so much math.

2914
03:18:24,912 --> 03:18:31,858
MATT: Okay. You hear a distant echo of a slam of
impact that seems like the breaking of water,

2915
03:18:31,858 --> 03:18:40,382
along with the hitting of stone. You hear this
distant, echoing (groans) "Ouch."

2916
03:18:40,382 --> 03:18:42,667
LAURA: Okay, she's alive.

2917
03:18:42,667 --> 03:18:46,739
SAM: Wait, we hear her say something, I mean,
she's not underwater drowning or anything.

2918
03:18:46,739 --> 03:18:54,066
MATT: Correct. The hit of water and stone sounds
like wherever she landed, it was shallow enough to

2919
03:18:54,066 --> 03:19:01,953
impact when she landed. But not enough for her to,
like, sink or anywhere. But she is, right now,

2920
03:19:01,953 --> 03:19:08,584
effectively out of this fight, ending her turn.
Zahra, you're up.

2921
03:19:08,584 --> 03:19:24,269
MARY: All right, if I move to this tiny little
alcove, right there. Can it see me?

2922
03:19:24,269 --> 03:19:28,978
MATT: You're not within its main eye, but it can
see everything around it.

2923
03:19:28,978 --> 03:19:38,273
MARY: Then I'm going to Hex it? No, no, I'm going
to use Witch Bolt.

2924
03:19:38,273 --> 03:19:41,925
MATT: All right. What level?

2925
03:19:41,925 --> 03:19:45,772
MARY: I'm a warlock, what level can I use it at?

2926
03:19:45,772 --> 03:19:48,341
MATT: Well, what level would it be? It would be
your max level as a warlock.

2927
03:19:48,341 --> 03:19:53,744
MARY: I don't know, I'm sorry--

2928
03:19:53,744 --> 03:19:55,369
LAURA: Six. Seven.

2929
03:19:55,369 --> 03:20:01,666
MARY: Six. Seven was last week, and that doesn't
count anymore!

2930
03:20:01,666 --> 03:20:03,385
WILL: No. You can't finger it to death!

2931
03:20:03,385 --> 03:20:06,166
MARY: I can't finger it to death and I want--
wait, what?

2932
03:20:06,166 --> 03:20:07,654
(laughter)

2933
03:20:07,654 --> 03:20:09,074
TALIESIN: Wow.

2934
03:20:09,074 --> 03:20:18,470
MARY: Which is a plus 11 attack bonus, and then
5d12 plus two.

2935
03:20:18,470 --> 03:20:22,091
MATT: So you, yeah, correct. Well, technically it
would be 6d12 if you're doing it at a sixth level.

2936
03:20:22,091 --> 03:20:24,173
MARY: Oh, 6d12.

2937
03:20:24,173 --> 03:20:31,226
MATT: Go ahead and roll to see if you hit first.
You have to roll to-- It'd be a d20, and add your

2938
03:20:31,226 --> 03:20:32,915
ranged spell bonus.

2939
03:20:32,915 --> 03:20:40,548
MARY: What is my ranged spell attack bonus? Do you
know that?

2940
03:20:40,548 --> 03:20:46,691
LAURA: Your ranged attack bonus? 11.

2941
03:20:46,691 --> 03:20:50,660
MARY: 11-- and what is that? I think it's a nine.
20.

2942
03:20:50,660 --> 03:20:55,685
MATT: Okay, so you rolled a 20 total? That hits.
Go ahead and roll 6d12 lightning damage.

2943
03:20:55,685 --> 03:20:58,297
LAURA: 6d12!? Holy crap, girl!

2944
03:20:58,297 --> 03:21:02,073
MARISHA: That's hot.

2945
03:21:02,073 --> 03:21:22,335
WILL: God, I can't get 'fingered to death' outta
my head.

2946
03:21:22,335 --> 03:21:37,450
MARY: 24. Close. Better than the other ones.

2947
03:21:37,450 --> 03:21:40,335
MATT: 24?

2948
03:21:40,335 --> 03:21:42,086
MARY: 24 plus two.

2949
03:21:42,086 --> 03:21:51,524
MATT: Okay. So 26. All right, so the lightning
blasts into its side. One of the nearest stalks

2950
03:21:51,524 --> 03:21:56,530
just looks over at you to acknowledge the impact,
and you just hear a slight snarl as the eye looks

2951
03:21:56,530 --> 03:22:00,004
out of the corner towards you. Is that going to
end your turn?

2952
03:22:00,004 --> 03:22:01,018
MARY: Mm-hmm.

2953
03:22:01,018 --> 03:22:04,020
MATT: Brings us to the top. Vex, you're up.

2954
03:22:04,020 --> 03:22:10,021
LAURA: Okay. Am I-- can it see me in its eye?
Would I be in its thingy?

2955
03:22:10,021 --> 03:22:12,559
MATT: It is looking in your direction.

2956
03:22:12,559 --> 03:22:20,425
LAURA: I'm going to move stealthily along the wall
so I can maybe be out of that thing. Can I be?

2957
03:22:20,511 --> 03:22:31,699
MATT: You don't know. We'll find out when you
stop. To there? You would still be in the eye range.

2958
03:22:31,699 --> 03:22:34,111
LAURA: Fuckin' shit bitch.

2959
03:22:34,111 --> 03:22:44,999
LIAM: Only she can get away with that. None of the
rest of us can.

2960
03:22:44,999 --> 03:22:52,076
LAURA: Am I hiding? Am I still hidden?

2961
03:22:52,076 --> 03:22:58,651
MATT: No, because you revealed yourself in the
attack you did a little while ago. I mean, you can

2962
03:22:58,651 --> 03:23:02,474
duck partially. If you want to use an action to
try and hide you can do that.

2963
03:23:02,474 --> 03:23:06,904
LAURA: No, I don't want to do that, I just want to
make my motion hide behind a pillar, maybe.

2964
03:23:06,904 --> 03:23:14,282
SAM: Oh, wait, remember, Laura, you can move a
little bit faster because you have 30 gold less

2965
03:23:14,282 --> 03:23:15,752
than you did earlier.

2966
03:23:15,752 --> 03:23:18,225
(laughter)

2967
03:23:18,225 --> 03:23:19,971
WILL: But she's weighed down by the book!

2968
03:23:19,971 --> 03:23:28,541
LAURA: Yeah, I appreciate it. My pouches are still
pretty heavy. I'm going to hold my action until

2969
03:23:28,541 --> 03:23:35,505
he's looking away from me. And I want to move
Trinket behind the wall.

2970
03:23:35,505 --> 03:23:45,762
MATT: So Trinket moves behind the wall there,
looking over at you, you can see noticeable fear

2971
03:23:45,762 --> 03:23:50,817
in Trinket's face. All right, at the end of your
turn it's going to use its third legendary action.

2972
03:23:50,817 --> 03:23:56,803
It's going to take another eye roll-- another eye
beam. This one is going to fire at Grog.

2973
03:23:56,803 --> 03:23:58,710
(groaning)

2974
03:23:58,710 --> 03:24:02,981
MATT: Actually, no, not Grog. It can still see the
pillar-- no, Grog, because you're one of the few,

2975
03:24:02,981 --> 03:24:06,460
like, big individuals in its front way that's not
in its ray.

2976
03:24:06,460 --> 03:24:09,616
TRAVIS: Does the pillar grant me any cover at
all?

2977
03:24:09,616 --> 03:24:19,039
MATT: Nope! We'll see what it does, though. All
right, I need you to make a constitution saving throw.

2978
03:24:19,039 --> 03:24:23,252
TRAVIS: 19?

2979
03:24:23,252 --> 03:24:24,698
MATT: 19.

2980
03:24:24,698 --> 03:24:26,877
TRAVIS: 20, actually. 11 plus nine is 20.

2981
03:24:26,877 --> 03:24:32,234
MATT: All right, cool. So, as a yellowish beam
streaks across and slams into your back, you feel

2982
03:24:32,234 --> 03:24:37,697
your back muscles tense up and lock up and you
resist the effect once again. You just have that

2983
03:24:37,697 --> 03:24:41,990
hardy constitution of a goliath who seems to be
resisting every one of these beams that slams into

2984
03:24:41,990 --> 03:24:47,918
you for the time being. Vax, it's your turn.

2985
03:24:47,918 --> 03:24:52,742
LIAM: I'm going to use Cunning Action to hide, and
then I'm going to run along the back wall to the

2986
03:24:52,742 --> 03:25:00,097
pillar by-- across from Vex, at the back of the
chamber. And if counting is right, I'm 60 feet

2987
03:25:00,097 --> 03:25:01,729
away from the beholder.

2988
03:25:01,729 --> 03:25:09,654
MATT: You'd be just within 60 feet.

2989
03:25:09,654 --> 03:25:14,359
LIAM: Just within, right. That's what I thought,
and I'm going to throw three daggers at his

2990
03:25:14,359 --> 03:25:15,818
fuckin' eyeball.

2991
03:25:15,818 --> 03:25:24,468
MATT: Go for it. You used your bonus action to
hide, so you get two attacks.

2992
03:25:24,468 --> 03:25:29,493
LIAM: Two attacks? But I got the hasted boots on.
I clicked the heels.

2993
03:25:29,493 --> 03:25:31,793
MATT: Right. But you only have one attack with
your main action.

2994
03:25:31,793 --> 03:25:36,609
LIAM: Oh, right! Thanks. And do I have advantage--
no one's near him, right?

2995
03:25:36,609 --> 03:25:38,298
MATT: You have to roll a stealth check to see if
he sees you or not.

2996
03:25:38,298 --> 03:25:47,153
LIAM: All right. Use my last Luck. No, that's okay
because I'm me, so that is 25.

2997
03:25:47,153 --> 03:25:50,531
MATT: 25, okay. So go ahead and roll your
attacks.

2998
03:25:50,531 --> 03:25:53,686
LIAM: All right, so the first attack was an
eight-- 18.

2999
03:25:53,686 --> 03:25:57,318
MATT: 18 hits. And you do have advantage on these
because he does not see you.

3000
03:25:57,318 --> 03:26:00,776
LIAM: Okay. So the first attack was 18 plus--
sorry, it was 30--

3001
03:26:00,776 --> 03:26:01,812
MATT: Hits.

3002
03:26:01,812 --> 03:26:05,942
LIAM: And the second attack was 28.

3003
03:26:05,942 --> 03:26:09,666
MATT: Both hit. Go ahead and roll damage, and
sneak attack on the first hit because he did not

3004
03:26:09,666 --> 03:26:15,535
see where you were. Surprisingly, being an entity
covered in eyes.

3005
03:26:15,535 --> 03:26:27,045
LIAM: One plus two, five, ten, 11, 15, 16, 17, 20
for the first. No, 27.

3006
03:26:27,045 --> 03:26:28,448
MATT: Seven, yeah, all right, okay.

3007
03:26:28,448 --> 03:26:30,205
LIAM: And then the second attack is-- ten.

3008
03:26:30,205 --> 03:26:36,263
MATT: Got it. 37. Rushing up behind the side,
ducking into the shadows, you go around the pillar

3009
03:26:36,263 --> 03:26:41,850
and-- watch one dagger spin around and watch a
second one. Both of them sinking into him. Adjusts

3010
03:26:41,850 --> 03:26:45,082
in place angrily from the pain and impact, but--
yeah.

3011
03:26:45,082 --> 03:26:47,978
LIAM: I also make a little, like, raspberry noise
at the end and go (pffbt).

3012
03:26:47,978 --> 03:26:53,666
MATT: Cool. That's what breaks your stealth. Not
the attacks, strangely. Okay. That ends your turn.

3013
03:26:53,666 --> 03:26:55,592
Kashaw, you're up.

3014
03:26:55,592 --> 03:27:01,381
WILL: I know, but if he's looking right at me-- I
mean, he can see me, essentially, looking right at

3015
03:27:01,381 --> 03:27:02,459
me, correct?

3016
03:27:02,459 --> 03:27:05,472
MATT: Everything else except for you and Percy are
directly out of the main eye, but his eyestalks

3017
03:27:05,472 --> 03:27:08,913
look all over the entire room and they keep
shifting and taking in the awareness of the

3018
03:27:08,913 --> 03:27:12,434
surroundings. But the big eye is just staring
right at you intently.

3019
03:27:12,434 --> 03:27:17,408
WILL: Can I get out of the direct-- well, can you
cast magic against the big eye or no?

3020
03:27:17,408 --> 03:27:19,246
MATT: You don't know.

3021
03:27:19,246 --> 03:27:25,671
WILL: So should we give it a shot? See, that's the
thing, is he's staring right at me.

3022
03:27:25,671 --> 03:27:27,152
MARISHA: You could move out of it.

3023
03:27:27,152 --> 03:27:32,156
WILL: First thing we want to do is run away. Can
we get out of the range of the eye somehow?

3024
03:27:32,156 --> 03:27:37,114
MATT: Possibly. You have not encountered a
beholder in your time. Go ahead and roll an

3025
03:27:37,114 --> 03:27:39,142
intelligence check.

3026
03:27:39,142 --> 03:27:41,669
WILL: God, it's ironic that I don't even know how
to do that.

3027
03:27:41,669 --> 03:27:51,883
MATT: Just modifier.

3028
03:27:51,883 --> 03:27:53,472
MARISHA: Plus two.

3029
03:27:53,472 --> 03:27:55,003
WILL: Yeah. So 12.

3030
03:27:55,003 --> 03:27:57,282
MATT: Do what you want to do!

3031
03:27:57,282 --> 03:27:59,999
WILL: Thanks for that! How far away can I get?

3032
03:27:59,999 --> 03:28:03,058
MATT: I mean, you can move six squares. 30 feet,
so.

3033
03:28:03,058 --> 03:28:15,546
WILL: Two, three. I want to get away from the eye.
Can we move to behind that wall? Is that possible?

3034
03:28:15,546 --> 03:28:17,066
MATT: Yup.

3035
03:28:17,066 --> 03:28:22,637
WILL: And then, I still can see him, though, but
he can look at me, and I'm just going to be

3036
03:28:22,637 --> 03:28:33,115
wasting stuff if he-- So I'm going to hold my
action until he's not staring right at me. Can we

3037
03:28:33,115 --> 03:28:34,357
do that?

3038
03:28:34,357 --> 03:28:35,669
MATT: Sure.

3039
03:28:35,669 --> 03:28:41,221
WILL: There's not much I can do. Yeah. So that's
what I'm going to do. Going to run away.

3040
03:28:41,221 --> 03:28:48,303
MATT: Okay, that ends your turn. It is now the
beholder's turn. The beholder is going to float up

3041
03:28:48,303 --> 03:28:51,873
towards the ceiling of the area--

3042
03:28:51,873 --> 03:28:53,772
LIAM: How high does he go?

3043
03:28:53,772 --> 03:28:55,591
MATT: This is going to put it at--

3044
03:28:55,591 --> 03:28:57,485
WILL: 25 feet, right?

3045
03:28:57,485 --> 03:29:09,657
MATT: This is going to be-- let's see-- Need to
find something to weigh that down, actually.

3046
03:29:09,657 --> 03:29:15,268
TALIESIN: Make a sandbag.

3047
03:29:15,268 --> 03:29:20,249
MATT: Perfect. All right, so it is approximately
20 feet up right now, which gets it out of

3048
03:29:20,249 --> 03:29:22,596
predominantly melee range of most anything at the
moment.

3049
03:29:22,596 --> 03:29:28,714
LAURA: So now when it looks down at us, does it
change the direction of the cone?

3050
03:29:28,714 --> 03:29:43,406
MATT: The cone still spreads in the area. And it's
going to look right there. So it looks away from

3051
03:29:43,406 --> 03:29:48,451
you, Kash, so what action did you want to
prepare?

3052
03:29:48,451 --> 03:29:55,766
WILL: Should we try it now, do you think? I'm
going to try to blind it. So if he can't see,

3053
03:29:55,766 --> 03:30:01,187
maybe he can't do some shit. So I'm going to cast
Blindness at a third level.

3054
03:30:01,187 --> 03:30:02,660
MATT: Okay!

3055
03:30:02,660 --> 03:30:12,375
TALIESIN: He's reading 'Blindness' right now.

3056
03:30:12,375 --> 03:30:19,093
MATT: All right, so, constitution saving throw--
That is a 19. Where's the DC?

3057
03:30:19,093 --> 03:30:26,127
MARISHA: It's fucking 18.

3058
03:30:26,127 --> 03:30:28,136
MATT: It resists the spell, unfortunately.

3059
03:30:28,136 --> 03:30:30,983
WILL: Oh, shit.

3060
03:30:30,983 --> 03:30:37,521
MATT: However, it is now going to make three eye
ray attacks. Let's see who's in the radius here.

3061
03:30:37,521 --> 03:30:50,012
It can't get a ray towards the four of you, so
it's going to do one ray at Zahra, one ray at you,

3062
03:30:50,012 --> 03:31:04,692
Kashaw, and another ray at Zahra. Zahra gets two
rays. So, Mary, I need you to make a constitution

3063
03:31:04,692 --> 03:31:06,150
saving throw.

3064
03:31:06,150 --> 03:31:07,988
SAM: With inspiration.

3065
03:31:07,988 --> 03:31:09,306
MATT: If you need it.

3066
03:31:09,306 --> 03:31:16,366
LAURA: Add your inspiration, add your
inspiration.

3067
03:31:16,366 --> 03:31:18,835
MARY: With an inspiration-- I have Luck, too.

3068
03:31:18,835 --> 03:31:20,713
SAM: Ooh! Yeah, yeah.

3069
03:31:20,713 --> 03:31:23,318
LAURA: Whenever you need it, but you have an
inspiration dice here. That's good.

3070
03:31:23,318 --> 03:31:28,909
So you're at 18.

3071
03:31:28,909 --> 03:31:30,074
MARY: 18.

3072
03:31:30,074 --> 03:31:34,078
MATT: 18. Okay. A similar yellowish ray that hit
Grog earlier strikes past you and it hits you, but

3073
03:31:34,078 --> 03:31:44,639
you manage to resist the effect. A light blue ray
streaks across towards you, Kashaw. I need you to

3074
03:31:44,639 --> 03:31:46,514
go ahead and make a wisdom save.

3075
03:31:46,514 --> 03:31:48,112
WILL: A wisdom save?

3076
03:31:48,112 --> 03:31:52,599
MATT: Yes.

3077
03:31:52,599 --> 03:31:53,887
WILL: 20.

3078
03:31:53,887 --> 03:32:01,958
MATT: Slams into you, a wave of intense sleepiness
comes over you, but you shake yourself out of it.

3079
03:32:01,958 --> 03:32:09,321
Third ray goes towards you, Zahra. I need you to
make a dexterity saving throw.

3080
03:32:09,321 --> 03:32:12,145
MARY: I have no dexterity--

3081
03:32:12,145 --> 03:32:15,029
LIAM: Come on, use Luck if it's sucky.

3082
03:32:15,029 --> 03:32:17,256
MARY: 17.

3083
03:32:17,256 --> 03:32:25,120
MATT: 17. You manage to duck out of the way as it
slams into the wall behind you. This entire chunk,

3084
03:32:25,120 --> 03:32:28,220
now, is gone.

3085
03:32:28,220 --> 03:32:29,715
SAM: What's behind there?

3086
03:32:29,715 --> 03:32:34,530
MATT: You see there's a chunk of rock and earth
that has been exposed on the opposite side as it

3087
03:32:34,530 --> 03:32:36,946
just disintegrated that portion of the room.

3088
03:32:36,946 --> 03:32:42,594
WILL: He can also just take apart pieces of the
model, that's amazing.

3089
03:32:42,594 --> 03:32:49,140
MATT: That ends its turn. And now-- Because at the
top of the round--

3090
03:32:49,140 --> 03:32:53,154
MARY: Thank you, Scanlan! Love, kisses, kisses and
love.

3091
03:32:53,154 --> 03:32:57,946
MATT: Out of one of the slimy surfaces in the room
you see, all of a sudden, the stone opens up a

3092
03:32:57,946 --> 03:33:04,093
phantom eye that just appears out of nowhere, not
even attached to this beholder. As it does,

3093
03:33:04,093 --> 03:33:06,364
another beam streaks out of it--

3094
03:33:06,364 --> 03:33:07,648
TRAVIS: What?

3095
03:33:07,648 --> 03:33:10,270
MATT: Yes. This is going to be--

3096
03:33:10,270 --> 03:33:14,863
TALIESIN: What?

3097
03:33:14,863 --> 03:33:16,741
MATT: This'll be at Scanlan.

3098
03:33:16,741 --> 03:33:22,152
LAURA: Where did the beam come out of? Where's the
eye? Where's the phantom eye?

3099
03:33:22,152 --> 03:33:29,419
MATT: The eye for this one will be streaking out
of this pillar here. No, no, it'll be this pillar

3100
03:33:29,419 --> 03:33:34,215
or this wall here, and it just hits toward
Scanlan. In the vicinity of the room.

3101
03:33:34,215 --> 03:33:40,384
MATT: I need you to make a constitution saving
throw, Scanlan.

3102
03:33:40,384 --> 03:33:45,837
SAM: Constitution this time? 20.

3103
03:33:45,837 --> 03:33:55,001
MATT: 20! All right. As a familiar beam hits you
and begins to lift you off the ground, you manage

3104
03:33:55,001 --> 03:33:59,579
to grab onto the side of the stonework and pull
yourself out of its force before it can throw you

3105
03:33:59,579 --> 03:34:02,869
into the same hole that Kima had tumbled into.

3106
03:34:02,869 --> 03:34:05,316
WILL: The Kima hole.

3107
03:34:05,316 --> 03:34:07,402
(laughter)

3108
03:34:07,402 --> 03:34:09,077
MATT: All right. Grog, you're up.

3109
03:34:09,077 --> 03:34:12,580
TRAVIS: I'd like to run directly beneath it and
slightly behind him.

3110
03:34:12,580 --> 03:34:13,827
MATT: Okay.

3111
03:34:13,827 --> 03:34:16,016
SAM: Hold! Hold.

3112
03:34:16,016 --> 03:34:21,190
TRAVIS: There we go, right there, that's perfect.
And I would like to use the Chain of Returning on

3113
03:34:21,190 --> 03:34:25,199
Craven Edge and throw it up into the bottom of the
Beholder.

3114
03:34:25,199 --> 03:34:27,626
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll for an attack.

3115
03:34:27,626 --> 03:34:30,247
TRAVIS: 23.

3116
03:34:30,247 --> 03:34:36,018
MATT: That hits! With a five, it fails its saving
throw, so you take a plus one strength, he takes a

3117
03:34:36,018 --> 03:34:37,268
minus one strength.

3118
03:34:37,268 --> 03:34:41,267
TRAVIS: Yay, amazing! 19.

3119
03:34:41,267 --> 03:34:42,805
MATT: 19?

3120
03:34:42,805 --> 03:34:44,366
TRAVIS: Yeah, 19 points of damage.

3121
03:34:44,366 --> 03:34:50,727
MATT: All right, great. The blade sinks into it,
as you yank it back, go ahead and make an

3122
03:34:50,727 --> 03:34:52,922
athletics check to pull the blade back.

3123
03:34:52,922 --> 03:34:57,579
TRAVIS: Oh, that's an eight.

3124
03:34:57,579 --> 03:35:02,250
MATT: That's an eight-- You yank on the chain, and
it's just still embedded in the bottom of the

3125
03:35:02,250 --> 03:35:04,327
beholder, you can't seem to pull it back.

3126
03:35:04,327 --> 03:35:06,096
TRAVIS: That's all right. Go for a ride.

3127
03:35:06,096 --> 03:35:09,178
LIAM: It's like a balloon in the Macy's Day
Parade.

3128
03:35:09,178 --> 03:35:10,824
TRAVIS: I did get the one strength one?

3129
03:35:10,824 --> 03:35:12,924
MATT: You did, yes. All right, Grog, is that the
end of your turn?

3130
03:35:12,924 --> 03:35:13,948
TRAVIS: Yes.

3131
03:35:13,948 --> 03:35:18,506
MATT: Scanlan, you're up. You lucky, lucky
gnome, it's your turn.

3132
03:35:18,506 --> 03:35:20,298
SAM: He's 25 feet up?

3133
03:35:20,298 --> 03:35:23,919
MATT: 20 feet up, technically.

3134
03:35:23,919 --> 03:35:28,143
SAM: If I aim a Fireball right at the roof, will
it hit any of us?

3135
03:35:28,143 --> 03:35:29,826
MATT: Right at the roof?

3136
03:35:29,826 --> 03:35:32,193
SAM: 20-foot radius.

3137
03:35:32,193 --> 03:35:41,956
MATT: It might, you don't know. Depends on where
you're hitting. If you aim it up here, it may hit Grog.

3138
03:35:41,956 --> 03:35:43,439
LAURA: Just do it.

3139
03:35:43,439 --> 03:35:47,524
SAM: I'll aim on the far side of the beholder.

3140
03:35:47,524 --> 03:35:48,975
MATT: Over here?

3141
03:35:48,975 --> 03:35:51,747
SAM: Yeah, just up from there.

3142
03:35:51,747 --> 03:35:55,777
MATT: Well, you can't see that wall area because
it's all blocked there, you can only see through

3143
03:35:55,777 --> 03:36:00,122
this passage. So you can only hit anything on the
ceiling and this way. Unless you move into the room.

3144
03:36:00,122 --> 03:36:04,404
SAM: Well, I'll just try to get it as far away
from Grog as I can.

3145
03:36:04,404 --> 03:36:09,560
MATT: Okay. So we'll say about there is where you
can hit it. Go for it.

3146
03:36:09,560 --> 03:36:18,022
SAM: Okay! Wand of Fireballs, and I'll do it at
fourth level.

3147
03:36:18,022 --> 03:36:22,695
MATT: Okay! What is the DC for the wand?

3148
03:36:22,695 --> 03:36:27,157
SAM: If I use my-- Does that go through the
Handcone?

3149
03:36:27,157 --> 03:36:29,176
MATT: Not for the wand, no. The wand has its own
DC. It should--

3150
03:36:29,176 --> 03:36:31,674
SAM: The wand has-- ew, a DC of 15.

3151
03:36:31,674 --> 03:36:35,733
MATT: Okay. It does make the save, so it takes
half damage. So go ahead and roll damage on that.

3152
03:36:35,733 --> 03:36:37,432
TRAVIS: Do I have to make a save?

3153
03:36:37,432 --> 03:36:41,627
MATT: Currently with the blast area-- no, and it
would have hit Percy, except for-- as the Fireball

3154
03:36:41,627 --> 03:36:47,781
explodes, the fire just seems to dissipate around
the cone, actually absolving the flame from its

3155
03:36:47,781 --> 03:36:49,012
current position.

3156
03:36:49,012 --> 03:36:51,054
SAM: Is he going to be affected?

3157
03:36:51,054 --> 03:36:52,615
MATT: He is affected, yes.

3158
03:36:52,615 --> 03:37:01,711
SAM: Okay. 30. So 15.

3159
03:37:01,711 --> 03:37:07,054
MATT: 15 points of fire damage. Okay. The blast,
and you can see some stones (thuds) from the

3160
03:37:07,054 --> 03:37:12,681
ceiling from the impact of the blast. It weirdly
shapes around the cone in the front of its eye.

3161
03:37:12,681 --> 03:37:15,757
And do you want to move or are 
you going to stay where you are?

3162
03:37:15,757 --> 03:37:23,654
SAM: If I move, he's going to hit me. I will inch
away from the precipice?

3163
03:37:23,654 --> 03:37:27,685
WILL: "I will inch away from the Kima-hole."

3164
03:37:27,685 --> 03:37:32,532
TALIESIN: God, you even make that sound weird.

3165
03:37:32,532 --> 03:37:42,669
SAM: Let's see, who's going next-- I will inspire
Percy with a song. I will sing: (sings) And if

3166
03:37:42,669 --> 03:37:50,238
we're talking Percy, you got a perfect gun, so put
it on me and pull that trigger, if you shoot him

3167
03:37:50,238 --> 03:37:54,197
right, you'll end his life, on and on and on--

3168
03:37:54,197 --> 03:37:58,274
(cheering)

3169
03:37:58,274 --> 03:38:05,018
MATT: Take a d10 inspiration dice for that. All
right, Percy, it's your turn.

3170
03:38:05,018 --> 03:38:10,346
TALIESIN: First I'm going to deal with this fucker
in front of me, so I'm just going to pull out my

3171
03:38:10,346 --> 03:38:13,194
sword and slash him and stab him and see what
happens.

3172
03:38:13,194 --> 03:38:17,159
MATT: Okay. So using your quick draw you-- Well,
you have one hand, so you can pull out a second

3173
03:38:17,159 --> 03:38:19,371
weapon. So go for it.

3174
03:38:19,371 --> 03:38:28,532
TALIESIN: It's a one-handed sword. That's 19 to
hit?

3175
03:38:28,532 --> 03:38:30,251
MATT: 19 hits.

3176
03:38:30,251 --> 03:38:35,525
TALIESIN: All right, and that's ten points of
damage?

3177
03:38:35,525 --> 03:38:44,033
MATT: Ten points of damage. With that you
eviscerate-- As it croaks out (croaks) and just

3178
03:38:44,033 --> 03:38:45,918
falls to the ground gurgling, into a pile.

3179
03:38:45,918 --> 03:38:51,508
TALIESIN: Sorry. I don't speak Fish.

3180
03:38:51,508 --> 03:38:54,440
(laughter)

3181
03:38:54,440 --> 03:39:00,997
TALIESIN: It's the worst kill line ever. I
especially floundered that one.

3182
03:39:00,997 --> 03:39:03,609
LAURA: Can I ask a technical question?

3183
03:39:03,609 --> 03:39:04,511
MATT: Yes.

3184
03:39:04,511 --> 03:39:08,986
LAURA: If I've held my action until he does
something and he never does it, do I ever get to go?

3185
03:39:08,986 --> 03:39:10,081
MATT: Nope.

3186
03:39:10,081 --> 03:39:12,513
LAURA: I just hold it until the end of the turn?

3187
03:39:12,513 --> 03:39:13,985
MATT: Yep, and then you get a next turn.

3188
03:39:13,985 --> 03:39:18,249
LIAM: So technically that's a gamble, and if the
thing you ask for never happens you forfeit your turn?

3189
03:39:18,249 --> 03:39:24,120
MATT: Let me check the rules real fast just to make
sure, because I don't want to screw you over.

3190
03:39:24,120 --> 03:39:26,676
LAURA: It's good to know I'm gambling that away
if--

3191
03:39:26,676 --> 03:39:30,997
MATT: Let me double-check, because the internet
will let me know if I mess it up. It's technically

3192
03:39:30,997 --> 03:39:33,293
readying an action, so--

3193
03:39:33,293 --> 03:39:36,363
LIAM: Did you remember Hunter's Mark?

3194
03:39:36,363 --> 03:39:41,916
LAURA: I didn't do Hunter's Mark on purpose.
Because I can't do any magic on him, because he's

3195
03:39:41,916 --> 03:39:43,373
looking at me.

3196
03:39:43,373 --> 03:39:51,702
MATT: How it is with this, essentially, is you
wait for the trigger, or you can ignore the

3197
03:39:51,702 --> 03:39:55,461
trigger, which means if you want to, you can just
do it at any point if it never happens, so at the

3198
03:39:55,461 --> 03:39:57,763
end of the next person's turn, you could
unleash--

3199
03:39:57,763 --> 03:39:59,509
LAURA: Say 'screw it.'

3200
03:39:59,509 --> 03:40:00,623
MATT: Totally.

3201
03:40:00,623 --> 03:40:02,677
LIAM: So you can just chime in and say, 'Fuck what
I said, I'm going now'?

3202
03:40:02,677 --> 03:40:04,146
MATT: Yeah.

3203
03:40:04,146 --> 03:40:09,827
TALIESIN: So, my other question is, my attempt to
cast a spell while in the cone-- does that cancel

3204
03:40:09,827 --> 03:40:11,902
out that spell so I can't cast it anymore?

3205
03:40:11,902 --> 03:40:17,945
MATT: Yes, the spell is used, unfortunately.
Beholders, man. They're assholes.

3206
03:40:17,945 --> 03:40:29,379
TALIESIN: I'm going to make a run for cover
towards the-- where's the laser pointer?

3207
03:40:29,379 --> 03:40:31,423
MATT: Towards which way?

3208
03:40:31,423 --> 03:40:37,128
TALIESIN: Run that way. There. Am I still in
its--

3209
03:40:37,128 --> 03:40:38,703
MATT: One more, if you want to.

3210
03:40:38,703 --> 03:40:42,811
TALIESIN: Okay, and while I'm running I'm going to
take a shot, I'm going to pull out the big gun and

3211
03:40:42,811 --> 03:40:44,181
take a shot with the big gun.

3212
03:40:44,181 --> 03:40:45,678
MATT: Okay!

3213
03:40:45,678 --> 03:40:51,977
TALIESIN: And I'm going to attempt to make this a
legs/wing hit, and I'm going to try and knock him down.

3214
03:40:51,977 --> 03:40:54,181
MATT: Does not have legs, does not have wings.

3215
03:40:54,181 --> 03:40:55,818
TALIESIN: Oh, shit, okay, that's fair.

3216
03:40:55,818 --> 03:41:03,505
MATT: Hovering entities aren't really affected by
prone. You would know that.

3217
03:41:03,505 --> 03:41:12,394
TALIESIN: No they're not. That's very fair. In
that case, I'm going to just do a sharpshooter

3218
03:41:12,394 --> 03:41:14,064
shot and see how this goes.

3219
03:41:14,064 --> 03:41:15,736
MATT: Go for it.

3220
03:41:15,736 --> 03:41:28,418
TALIESIN: Roll well. And I have inspiration, which
I'm going to add to that. So that's-- That's 18 to hit?

3221
03:41:28,418 --> 03:41:33,470
MATT: 18 just hits. Scanlan comes through again!

3222
03:41:33,470 --> 03:41:41,434
TALIESIN: Thank you! That's very useful. Where's
my other d12? Why do I never have any d12s?

3223
03:41:41,434 --> 03:41:42,684
There they are.

3224
03:41:42,684 --> 03:41:44,461
MATT: Keyleth, you're on deck, so be prepared.

3225
03:41:44,461 --> 03:41:54,917
TALIESIN: Nine, ten, 11, 12-- That's 28 points of
damage.

3226
03:41:54,917 --> 03:41:56,672
MATT: 28 points of damage!

3227
03:41:56,672 --> 03:42:00,436
TALIESIN: And reload, and that's the end of my
turn.

3228
03:42:00,436 --> 03:42:03,291
MATT: That's the end of your turn, that's all your
attacks. Okay. That ends it with Percy. At the end

3229
03:42:03,291 --> 03:42:08,678
of your turn, Percy, it's going to do one of its
eye rays. This one is going to be towards Grog,

3230
03:42:08,678 --> 03:42:13,157
because Grog is out of the cone and rushed
underneath, throwing the blade up, and stuck into

3231
03:42:13,157 --> 03:42:21,464
it. One of the eyestalks shoots down-- Okay, Grog,
I need you to roll a dexterity saving throw.

3232
03:42:21,464 --> 03:42:33,366
TRAVIS: Yeah, I get advantage on those. Because
of-- D-D-D-Danger Sense! 19-- 21.

3233
03:42:33,366 --> 03:42:38,058
MATT: 21, all right, not a worry. You manage to
duck out of the way before it slams into you.

3234
03:42:38,058 --> 03:42:40,465
All right!

3235
03:42:40,465 --> 03:42:42,215
TRAVIS: What kind of ray was it?

3236
03:42:42,215 --> 03:42:46,742
MATT: It was a black ray that streaked towards
you. A ray you're very familiar with.

3237
03:42:46,742 --> 03:42:48,442
TRAVIS: Yeah, I remember that one.

3238
03:42:48,442 --> 03:42:53,454
MATT: All right, Keyleth. It's your go.

3239
03:42:53,454 --> 03:43:00,501
MARISHA: Question. Did enough stones fall out of
the ceiling that might be, like, me-shaped?

3240
03:43:00,570 --> 03:43:03,952
MATT: Not from the ceiling, no. You currently only have
two--

3241
03:43:03,952 --> 03:43:06,256
MARISHA: From the Fireball?

3242
03:43:06,256 --> 03:43:09,348
MATT: No, because it's mostly flame. It's the
impact and explosion, it's not enough to damage

3243
03:43:09,348 --> 03:43:10,908
the structure of it.

3244
03:43:10,908 --> 03:43:14,935
MARISHA: Is the ceiling considered worked stone or
is it just carved out?

3245
03:43:14,935 --> 03:43:23,371
MATT: Unfortunately it is considered worked stone.
If you wanted to, like, shape up there and try and

3246
03:43:23,371 --> 03:43:25,707
break through it, you could attempt that.

3247
03:43:25,707 --> 03:43:27,446
MARISHA: Yeah, let's do that.

3248
03:43:27,446 --> 03:43:28,544
MATT: Okay.

3249
03:43:28,544 --> 03:43:31,717
MARISHA: Like, the hole that was already created
by Scanlan's Fireball?

3250
03:43:31,717 --> 03:43:34,899
MATT: Okay. So, you-- what's your movement as an
earth elemental?

3251
03:43:34,899 --> 03:43:46,804
MARISHA: Well, I dunno, I'm doing the Earth Glide,
so-- Oh! 30 feet? Do I make it?

3252
03:43:46,804 --> 03:43:52,019
MATT: 20-- 30-- it's cutting it close.

3253
03:43:52,019 --> 03:43:56,066
MARISHA: Just make it? Okay. And I just want to--

3254
03:43:56,066 --> 03:44:00,087
MATT: All right, go ahead and make a strength
check, with the strength of the earth elemental.

3255
03:44:00,087 --> 03:44:09,919
MARISHA: Oh wait, was that cocked? I don't know. I
don't think so. And it's not great, no, seven.

3256
03:44:09,919 --> 03:44:16,639
MATT: Seven? No, you pull up and you slam your
fist into the stone beneath you, and it cracks a

3257
03:44:16,639 --> 03:44:20,982
little bit, but not enough to give way at all. So
you are currently resting up in this vicinity.

3258
03:44:20,982 --> 03:44:22,393
MARISHA: That's my turn?

3259
03:44:22,393 --> 03:44:24,871
MATT: I mean, that's your action and your
movement.

3260
03:44:24,871 --> 03:44:27,841
MARISHA: Try it again next time.

3261
03:44:27,841 --> 03:44:33,845
MATT: Kima can't do anything right now, so Kima's
just currently trying to heal her wounds a bit.

3262
03:44:33,845 --> 03:44:35,564
She can heal--

3263
03:44:35,564 --> 03:44:36,846
TALIESIN: "Okay! Not dead!"

3264
03:44:36,846 --> 03:44:39,471
LIAM: "Think I'll take a walk!"

3265
03:44:39,471 --> 03:44:46,291
MATT: At the end of your turn, it's going to
attempt another eye ray. This one is going to be

3266
03:44:46,291 --> 03:44:55,819
at Kashaw. Five through-- well, actually, those
they don't have to reroll for the same, because

3267
03:44:55,819 --> 03:44:59,104
they're each different turns. I need you to make a
dexterity save, Kashaw.

3268
03:44:59,104 --> 03:45:05,105
WILL: 21.

3269
03:45:05,105 --> 03:45:10,843
MATT: 21. You guys are rolling some serious
fucking saving throws! As a DM who loves using a

3270
03:45:10,843 --> 03:45:12,490
beholder, it's really frustrating.

3271
03:45:12,490 --> 03:45:16,031
(laughter)

3272
03:45:16,031 --> 03:45:19,633
MATT: That's great. All right, so you dodge the
same black ray that just streaked past Grog,

3273
03:45:19,633 --> 03:45:24,418
ducking out of the way as it (vmm) across the
wall. All right, that brings us to Zahra.

3274
03:45:24,418 --> 03:45:28,480
MARY: I believe I still have Witch Bolt going.
Now, my question is, because Witch Bolt is a

3275
03:45:28,480 --> 03:45:32,945
concentration, I still have a cantrip of Eldritch
Blast, which is not a concentration. May I use

3276
03:45:32,945 --> 03:45:35,007
Witch Bolt, just the single--

3277
03:45:35,007 --> 03:45:39,344
MATT: Witch Bolt is an action to use and it only
does 1d12.

3278
03:45:39,344 --> 03:45:43,815
MARY: Yes, I know, but it's still going, so
technically it's an automatic 1d12 damage.

3279
03:45:43,815 --> 03:45:46,000
MATT: Well, you have to use your action to do it,
which means you can't cast any other spells

3280
03:45:46,000 --> 03:45:47,056
if you do it.

3281
03:45:47,056 --> 03:45:48,411
MARY: I can't cast any other spells.

3282
03:45:48,411 --> 03:45:49,591
MATT: Yeah.

3283
03:45:49,591 --> 03:46:09,567
MARY: Big hairy balls. All right, I'm going to 
Eldritch Blast, plus invoke Agonizing Blast, which

3284
03:46:09,567 --> 03:46:12,332
does not use a spell slot.

3285
03:46:12,332 --> 03:46:15,228
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll three
attacks with your ranged spell attack

3286
03:46:15,228 --> 03:46:18,082
against the beholder.

3287
03:46:18,082 --> 03:46:19,141
LAURA: 12s.

3288
03:46:19,141 --> 03:46:21,119
MARY: These are d12s. I need d10s.

3289
03:46:21,119 --> 03:46:22,636
LAURA: You need 20s for attacks.

3290
03:46:22,636 --> 03:46:33,492
MARY: Oh, just attack? I'm going to use Luck. 12?

3291
03:46:33,492 --> 03:46:34,809
MATT: Plus?

3292
03:46:34,809 --> 03:46:36,624
LAURA: Plus your attack modifier.

3293
03:46:36,624 --> 03:46:38,612
MARY: I'm sorry. So that's 23.

3294
03:46:38,612 --> 03:46:40,432
MATT: Okay, so that hits. Second one?

3295
03:46:40,432 --> 03:46:44,834
MARY: (groans) 13.

3296
03:46:44,834 --> 03:46:46,766
MATT: Misses. And the third one?

3297
03:46:46,766 --> 03:46:48,920
MARY: Natural one.

3298
03:46:48,920 --> 03:46:50,232
LAURA: Oh no.

3299
03:46:50,232 --> 03:46:51,739
MARY: Can't Luck on that?

3300
03:46:51,739 --> 03:46:52,804
LAURA: I don't think so.

3301
03:46:52,804 --> 03:46:55,144
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll 1d10 plus
five.

3302
03:46:55,144 --> 03:47:02,921
MARY: Six plus five. 11.

3303
03:47:02,921 --> 03:47:07,116
MATT: 11 points of damage as your beam streaks and
blasts it from the side--

3304
03:47:07,116 --> 03:47:14,055
LAURA: I use my action, since that's the end of
it, right? I pop out and I shoot two arrows at

3305
03:47:14,055 --> 03:47:20,189
him. (grunts) That's it. Just like (groans).

3306
03:47:20,189 --> 03:47:21,559
WILL: That was awesome.

3307
03:47:21,559 --> 03:47:25,235
MATT: Both of the attacks do not get the magical
bonus to hit and damage, so whatever your attack

3308
03:47:25,235 --> 03:47:27,285
bonus is minus two to damage and hit.

3309
03:47:27,285 --> 03:47:29,759
LAURA: Because of my bracers. No.

3310
03:47:29,759 --> 03:47:34,809
MATT: Actually, it would be minus four. All of
your magical equipment doesn't work

3311
03:47:34,809 --> 03:47:35,881
when you're in its eye.

3312
03:47:35,881 --> 03:47:38,074
LAURA: I know, but my bracers only add to damage.

3313
03:47:38,074 --> 03:47:43,565
MATT: Right, but your actual bow is magical and
adds to hit and damage. Minus two to hit and minus

3314
03:47:43,565 --> 03:47:44,929
four to damage.

3315
03:47:44,929 --> 03:47:46,874
LAURA: Four to damage?! Why four?

3316
03:47:46,874 --> 03:47:53,082
MATT: Technically, it's just supposed to be plus two to
hit on that item, actually. Misunderstanding. It's

3317
03:47:53,082 --> 03:47:56,911
all good. So?

3318
03:47:56,911 --> 03:48:02,403
LAURA: Well, this one is 29.

3319
03:48:02,403 --> 03:48:05,390
MATT: That hits. And the other one is?

3320
03:48:05,390 --> 03:48:06,699
LAURA: 20.

3321
03:48:06,699 --> 03:48:08,786
MATT: This is with the minus two?

3322
03:48:08,786 --> 03:48:09,920
LAURA: Yeah.

3323
03:48:09,920 --> 03:48:14,441
MATT: Okay, they both hit. Roll damage on
each, minus four.

3324
03:48:14,441 --> 03:48:25,322
LAURA: Oh, god. That's pathetic. Five. Ten.

3325
03:48:25,322 --> 03:48:29,511
MATT: All right. 15 points of total damage. As you
streak around, releasing these two mundane arrows

3326
03:48:29,511 --> 03:48:34,228
from a mundane bow, momentarily, both hit, and you
can see now, it's starting to look a little rough.

3327
03:48:34,228 --> 03:48:39,028
It's hurting. There's streaks of blood out of
various wounds it's taken. It still has Craven

3328
03:48:39,028 --> 03:48:48,195
Edge jammed into its underside, stuck in its craw.
All right, so that brings us back to the end of

3329
03:48:48,195 --> 03:48:51,283
Zahra's turn, where it uses its third and final
ray.

3330
03:48:51,283 --> 03:48:54,061
MARY: I haven't moved.

3331
03:48:54,061 --> 03:48:56,398
MATT: Yeah, you can move if you want to. Where do
you want to move?

3332
03:48:56,398 --> 03:48:59,550
MARY: Actually, I'm going to stay where I am.

3333
03:48:59,550 --> 03:49:07,587
MATT: Okay. This last ray is going to--

3334
03:49:07,587 --> 03:49:09,748
TRAVIS: So tense in the silent moment before he
said that.

3335
03:49:09,748 --> 03:49:11,901
MARY: I know.

3336
03:49:11,901 --> 03:49:15,518
MATT: This one's going to be at Scanlan, since all
of the rays have hit everything else.

3337
03:49:15,518 --> 03:49:19,107
LAURA: Everybody's hiding.

3338
03:49:19,107 --> 03:49:22,842
MATT: Everyone's in his cone or hiding and
Scanlan's the one little visible one there.

3339
03:49:22,842 --> 03:49:25,972
LAURA: Oh, that's right. He can't attack anything
within his own cone.

3340
03:49:25,972 --> 03:49:28,656
MATT: All right, I need you to make a constitution
saving throw, Scanlan.

3341
03:49:28,656 --> 03:49:33,054
SAM: 17.

3342
03:49:33,054 --> 03:49:44,362
MATT: 17? All right. Jesus Christ, guys. You take,
as this shimmering purple ray slams into your

3343
03:49:44,362 --> 03:49:49,530
chest, you manage to get most of the ray to not
impact you in the flesh, but where it hits, you do

3344
03:49:49,530 --> 03:50:01,048
take some damage, so you suffer 16 points of
necrotic damage. All right. Vex, you're up.

3345
03:50:01,048 --> 03:50:10,255
LAURA: I am going to-- (scoffs) If I run back to
where I was standing, am I

3346
03:50:10,255 --> 03:50:11,792
out of its fricking cone?

3347
03:50:11,792 --> 03:50:12,981
MATT: You would be, yeah.

3348
03:50:12,981 --> 03:50:14,632
LAURA: All right, I'm going to do that.

3349
03:50:14,632 --> 03:50:16,754
(laughter)

3350
03:50:16,754 --> 03:50:19,793
MATT: You'd have to get over there to get to a
space out of it.

3351
03:50:19,793 --> 03:50:28,849
LAURA: All right. Back to all my magical stuff.
All right, I'm going to shoot from my Sky Sentinel

3352
03:50:28,849 --> 03:50:40,060
at him. That's my first attack for that, and that
is 22 for the first arrow, because it splits.

3353
03:50:40,060 --> 03:50:41,489
MATT: That hits.

3354
03:50:41,489 --> 03:50:42,643
LAURA: 20.

3355
03:50:42,643 --> 03:50:43,863
MATT: Hits.

3356
03:50:43,863 --> 03:50:51,891
LAURA: No, that was wrong. No, that's right. Oh,
that was weird. 16?

3357
03:50:51,891 --> 03:50:54,543
MATT: Misses. You get two hits on that with the
Sky Sentinel.

3358
03:50:54,543 --> 03:51:00,022
LAURA: Okay, so that adds 1d6 to my damage with
those.

3359
03:51:00,022 --> 03:51:01,319
MATT: Correct.

3360
03:51:01,319 --> 03:51:07,307
LAURA: Okay. Balls. Eight, nine, ten.

3361
03:51:07,307 --> 03:51:09,564
MARY: Kill it.

3362
03:51:09,564 --> 03:51:22,477
LAURA: 16 for the first. 14 for the second. And
then my second attack, I want to shoot through my

3363
03:51:22,477 --> 03:51:23,947
Blazing Bowstring at it.

3364
03:51:23,947 --> 03:51:27,314
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll for attack on that
one.

3365
03:51:27,314 --> 03:51:30,437
LAURA: 17?

3366
03:51:30,437 --> 03:51:36,129
MATT: As the arrow ignites in the middle of the
air, the enchantment is too strong and actually

3367
03:51:36,129 --> 03:51:40,923
burns the arrow to a cinder before it reaches its
target. Just scattering ash against its body.

3368
03:51:40,923 --> 03:51:43,077
TRAVIS: I hope that wasn't one you notched with
the owlbear feathers.

3369
03:51:43,077 --> 03:51:45,546
LAURA: Oh, no, that wasn't one of my owlbear
arrows, for sure. I'm going to duck behind the

3370
03:51:45,546 --> 03:51:47,047
wall right there, if I can.

3371
03:51:47,047 --> 03:51:52,646
MATT: Okay. Actually, currently, all of the areas
of the wall are taken by Trinket and Kashaw. You

3372
03:51:52,646 --> 03:51:54,530
could have Trinket move out of the way.

3373
03:51:54,530 --> 03:51:57,827
WILL: Fuck you! Get out of here. I got this part.
This is taken!

3374
03:51:57,827 --> 03:52:02,208
LAURA: No! Okay, I push Trinket out and make him
run around and hide behind the other wall.

3375
03:52:02,208 --> 03:52:03,677
(laughter)

3376
03:52:03,677 --> 03:52:05,460
TRAVIS: Wow. From the mother's mouth.

3377
03:52:05,460 --> 03:52:07,866
LAURA: I love you! Move.

3378
03:52:07,866 --> 03:52:09,695
MARY: Get out of the way.

3379
03:52:09,695 --> 03:52:15,602
LAURA: He's got 40, so technically he could make
it behind that other wall.

3380
03:52:15,602 --> 03:52:23,926
MATT: All right, so. At this point in time, now,
you can see where the slime all over the walls--

3381
03:52:23,926 --> 03:52:28,757
All of a sudden, a series of tendrils begin to
whip out of them.

3382
03:52:28,757 --> 03:52:31,465
SAM: Wow.

3383
03:52:31,465 --> 03:52:33,150
MARISHA: What is happening?

3384
03:52:33,150 --> 03:52:37,023
MATT: All right, so, good to know. So now pretty
much all of the slime-covered walls in here and

3385
03:52:37,023 --> 03:52:42,789
within this hallway are now reaching out these
semi-translucent, almost created out of the same

3386
03:52:42,789 --> 03:52:45,395
slime, tendrils that are reaching out and
grasping.

3387
03:52:45,395 --> 03:52:47,181
LAURA: What the--

3388
03:52:47,181 --> 03:52:48,534
LIAM: Over every part of the wall?

3389
03:52:48,534 --> 03:52:49,661
MATT: Yes.

3390
03:52:49,661 --> 03:52:51,497
MARY: How far out?

3391
03:52:51,497 --> 03:52:54,002
MATT: Out to here, so it's within ten feet.

3392
03:52:54,002 --> 03:52:56,106
LAURA: Everything at the walls. Anything hiding.

3393
03:52:56,106 --> 03:53:00,827
SAM: Oh, good. I'm glad that we're all right next
to a wall.

3394
03:53:00,827 --> 03:53:02,049
MATT: Vax, it's your turn.

3395
03:53:02,049 --> 03:53:04,972
LIAM: Can you show me where his glance is, again,
with that doohickus you have?

3396
03:53:04,972 --> 03:53:10,910
MATT: You have to guess. You don't know the
specific elements of his ray.

3397
03:53:10,910 --> 03:53:13,061
LIAM: I'm going to use Cunning Action to hide.

3398
03:53:13,061 --> 03:53:18,743
MATT: Well, first and foremost, at the beginning
of your turn, I need you to make a dexterity save.

3399
03:53:18,743 --> 03:53:25,023
LIAM: Yeah, evasion. Yeah, don't worry. That's
30.

3400
03:53:25,023 --> 03:53:31,790
MATT: All right. Don't say you're using evasion
yet. It doesn't damage you. Or you could have

3401
03:53:31,790 --> 03:53:35,695
wasted your evasion for no reason. However, you do
avoid being grappled as they try and grab onto you

3402
03:53:35,695 --> 03:53:38,542
and hold onto you. You can use your bonus action
to--?

3403
03:53:38,542 --> 03:53:39,523
LIAM: Hide.

3404
03:53:39,523 --> 03:53:41,461
MATT: All right, roll a stealth check.

3405
03:53:41,461 --> 03:53:45,181
LIAM: That is a 25.

3406
03:53:45,181 --> 03:53:46,759
MATT: 25, okay.

3407
03:53:46,759 --> 03:53:52,996
LIAM: I'm going to run past Trinket along the back
wall, all around the edge, over to where Vex and

3408
03:53:52,996 --> 03:53:54,493
Kash are.

3409
03:53:54,493 --> 03:53:55,792
MATT: All right, right there.

3410
03:53:55,792 --> 03:53:57,164
LIAM: I'm going to keep pushing along--

3411
03:53:57,164 --> 03:53:58,553
LAURA: This is our spot!

3412
03:53:58,553 --> 03:54:02,933
LIAM: I'm going to get between them, and I know
that slows the movement down, but I want to be in

3413
03:54:02,933 --> 03:54:08,634
there, and I'm going to use my two actions left to
throw daggers at the floating fucking bowling ball

3414
03:54:08,634 --> 03:54:09,820
with eyes.

3415
03:54:09,820 --> 03:54:11,372
LAURA: I duck so he can shoot.

3416
03:54:11,372 --> 03:54:16,650
MATT: You do not have advantage, because it rolled
a natural 20 on its perception check and you are

3417
03:54:16,650 --> 03:54:17,641
not stealthed.

3418
03:54:17,641 --> 03:54:21,016
LIAM: Oh, wow. So the first one is a 21.

3419
03:54:21,016 --> 03:54:22,687
MATT: That hits.

3420
03:54:22,687 --> 03:54:27,192
LIAM: Yeah. Second one is a 17.

3421
03:54:27,192 --> 03:54:28,460
MATT: That misses.

3422
03:54:28,460 --> 03:54:31,981
LIAM: So it's a measly little attack of nine.

3423
03:54:31,981 --> 03:54:38,312
MATT: Nine points of damage. A little toothpick
impact. That ends your turn.

3424
03:54:38,312 --> 03:54:43,690
LIAM: No! I use the last of my movement to lower
down behind Kash.

3425
03:54:43,690 --> 03:54:46,307
(laughter)

3426
03:54:46,307 --> 03:54:47,872
WILL: Wow.

3427
03:54:47,872 --> 03:54:51,998
MATT: Kash, at the beginning of your turn, I need
you to roll a dexterity save.

3428
03:54:51,998 --> 03:54:54,357
WILL: Ten.

3429
03:54:54,357 --> 03:55:00,151
MATT: Ten. The tendrils wrap around you, and
you're currently grappled, which means you cannot move.

3430
03:55:00,151 --> 03:55:06,927
WILL: Okay, so can I cast-- well, can I use
Freedom of Movement on myself?

3431
03:55:06,927 --> 03:55:10,442
MATT: You could, yeah, if you really wanted to.

3432
03:55:10,442 --> 03:55:16,415
WILL: But I guess it wouldn't matter because then
that's my turn, right? Am I taking any damage as

3433
03:55:16,415 --> 03:55:17,693
it's holding onto me?

3434
03:55:17,693 --> 03:55:19,363
MATT: No, it's just holding you in place.

3435
03:55:19,363 --> 03:55:21,535
TALIESIN: It just feels really uncomfortable.

3436
03:55:21,535 --> 03:55:25,089
WILL: It does. It's just uncomfortable and frankly
just too close to me, and now a little creepy.

3437
03:55:25,089 --> 03:55:30,220
Then I guess there's not much I can do.

3438
03:55:30,220 --> 03:55:31,986
MARISHA: You can still cast a spell.

3439
03:55:31,986 --> 03:55:33,238
WILL: Can I cast a spell still?

3440
03:55:33,238 --> 03:55:34,424
MATT: You can certainly try to, yeah.

3441
03:55:34,424 --> 03:55:39,909
WILL: All right, then I'm going to try, even from
there, being grappled, a 6th-level Flame Strike.

3442
03:55:39,909 --> 03:55:41,411
MARISHA: Woo!

3443
03:55:41,411 --> 03:55:44,466
WILL: Let's try to do some damage here, if we
can.

3444
03:55:44,466 --> 03:55:51,855
MATT: So he's going to make his dex save, which he
makes, so he takes half damage, but go ahead and

3445
03:55:51,855 --> 03:55:54,877
roll 8d4. Oh, sorry, 8d6 points of damage.

3446
03:55:54,877 --> 03:56:15,468
WILL: d6. That's not bad at all. So we got ten,
16, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26.

3447
03:56:15,468 --> 03:56:19,061
MATT: 26, nice. So half of that would be 13.

3448
03:56:19,061 --> 03:56:20,248
WILL: 13.

3449
03:56:20,248 --> 03:56:26,422
MATT: 13 points of fire and radiant damage as the
column of flame bursts up around, impacting. You

3450
03:56:26,422 --> 03:56:29,590
feel the impact from beneath you, from the blast
of it.

3451
03:56:29,590 --> 03:56:31,806
MARISHA: Did it maybe loosen a little bit of stone
up a little bit more?

3452
03:56:31,806 --> 03:56:33,022
MATT: Maybe.

3453
03:56:33,022 --> 03:56:36,713
WILL: Nice. And then I can't do anything because
I'm grappled, so I can't even move.

3454
03:56:36,713 --> 03:56:38,321
MATT: You're grappled, so you can't move. You're
there.

3455
03:56:38,321 --> 03:56:41,194
WILL: That was my level six spell.

3456
03:56:41,194 --> 03:56:43,475
MATT: All righty. That ends your turn. It is now
the beholder's turn.

3457
03:56:43,475 --> 03:56:47,321
TALIESIN: It's been a while, hasn't it?

3458
03:56:47,321 --> 03:56:52,227
MATT: The beholder is going to turn this way.

3459
03:56:52,227 --> 03:56:54,104
TRAVIS: (laughs) Hey!

3460
03:56:54,104 --> 03:56:55,224
SAM: Hi!

3461
03:56:55,224 --> 03:56:58,906
MATT: It's going to back up this way, and it's
going to stare down in this direction now.

3462
03:56:58,906 --> 03:57:04,052
TALIESIN: Does Grog travel with it, since he's
hanging from the chain?

3463
03:57:04,052 --> 03:57:06,555
MATT: Do you want to hold on?

3464
03:57:06,555 --> 03:57:13,748
TRAVIS: Yeah. It's my fucking sword.

3465
03:57:13,748 --> 03:57:16,307
MATT: You get dragged along, holding onto the
chain.

3466
03:57:16,307 --> 03:57:18,374
(laughter)

3467
03:57:18,374 --> 03:57:19,832
TRAVIS: Yeehaw!

3468
03:57:19,832 --> 03:57:21,706
WILL: That is the greatest kite ever.

3469
03:57:21,706 --> 03:57:25,481
MATT: So that's going to be three eye ray shots.

3470
03:57:25,481 --> 03:57:28,745
SAM: Bye, guys.

3471
03:57:28,745 --> 03:57:31,065
TALIESIN: No, you're fine.

3472
03:57:31,065 --> 03:57:38,743
MATT: Yeah, you're in the cone. It can't hit you
with its eye ray. However, based on the visual

3473
03:57:38,743 --> 03:57:45,034
there, it's going to be two rays against Kashaw
and one against you.

3474
03:57:45,034 --> 03:57:46,401
LAURA: Me?

3475
03:57:46,401 --> 03:57:47,830
MATT: Vex. Yeah.

3476
03:57:47,830 --> 03:57:48,736
LAURA: It can see me?

3477
03:57:48,736 --> 03:57:51,557
MATT: Yeah, the eyestalks can see you from there.
From that vantage point at the very top, yeah.

3478
03:57:51,557 --> 03:57:58,397
Against you, Kashaw, I need you to make a
constitution saving throw.

3479
03:57:58,397 --> 03:58:01,045
WILL: (sighs) Nine.

3480
03:58:01,045 --> 03:58:02,063
MATT: Nine.

3481
03:58:02,063 --> 03:58:11,492
Your muscles tense up and lock as you are
paralyzed for a minute. You're frozen. While being

3482
03:58:11,492 --> 03:58:12,812
held by the tentacles.

3483
03:58:12,812 --> 03:58:13,864
WILL: Sweet.

3484
03:58:13,864 --> 03:58:15,480
MATT: You can't do anything on your turn.

3485
03:58:15,480 --> 03:58:18,537
TRAVIS: How do you like them tentacles now?

3486
03:58:18,537 --> 03:58:24,675
MATT: It still saw you. I need you to make a
dexterity saving throw.

3487
03:58:24,675 --> 03:58:25,996
LAURA: Okay.

3488
03:58:25,996 --> 03:58:29,388
WILL: Come on.

3489
03:58:29,388 --> 03:58:31,922
LAURA: 21.

3490
03:58:31,922 --> 03:58:38,279
MATT: 21. Yeah, you manage to duck out of the way.
This part of the wall actually, however, blasts

3491
03:58:38,279 --> 03:58:48,155
out from the impact there as the Disintegration
ray destroys the stonework. All right, and Kashaw,

3492
03:58:48,155 --> 03:58:50,280
I need you to make-- oh, no, you--

3493
03:58:50,280 --> 03:58:51,790
WILL: I can't do anything, you said.

3494
03:58:51,790 --> 03:58:54,261
MATT: You can't. You are paralyzed, so you
automatically fail dexterity saving throws.

3495
03:58:54,261 --> 03:58:55,829
MARISHA: Oh my god, that's bad.

3496
03:58:55,829 --> 03:59:02,456
MATT: All right. The beam hits you and your skin
begins to turn a dull gray as you begin to see

3497
03:59:02,456 --> 03:59:11,061
your flesh beginning to harden around your body.
That ends its turn. Grog, you're up.

3498
03:59:11,061 --> 03:59:19,641
TRAVIS: Can I run as far into the alcove that is
at his rear, just underneath him, as far as I can?

3499
03:59:19,641 --> 03:59:23,022
Yeah, right there. Maybe one step closer, so right
underneath him.

3500
03:59:23,022 --> 03:59:24,599
SAM: You're still attached to the thing?

3501
03:59:24,599 --> 03:59:25,612
LAURA: Yeah.

3502
03:59:25,612 --> 03:59:29,226
TRAVIS: Yeah, so I'd like to pull the blade out.

3503
03:59:29,226 --> 03:59:33,096
MATT: Okay, so this will be your bonus action to
pull it out. Make your athletics check.

3504
03:59:33,096 --> 03:59:37,294
TRAVIS: And can I-- awesome. 23?

3505
03:59:37,294 --> 03:59:40,001
MATT: Yeah. You pull the blade out and catch it in
your hand.

3506
03:59:40,001 --> 03:59:47,373
TRAVIS: Can I hold the rest of my action and look
at Scanlan and say, hey, Scanlan! Could you give me a lift?

3507
03:59:47,373 --> 03:59:51,419
SAM: Maybe!

3508
03:59:51,419 --> 03:59:54,080
TRAVIS: All right, I'm going to hold my action for
Scanlan.

3509
03:59:54,080 --> 04:00:04,720
MATT: (laughing) Okay. All right. At the end of
Grog's turn-- Actually, Grog. I fucking forgot to

3510
04:00:04,720 --> 04:00:12,406
do that. I need you to make a dexterity saving
throw, which you have advantage on.

3511
04:00:12,406 --> 04:00:15,319
TRAVIS: 19.

3512
04:00:15,319 --> 04:00:21,686
MATT: You're fine. All right, so at the end of
your turn, it's going to do one of its reactionary

3513
04:00:21,686 --> 04:00:33,573
eye rays. This one is going to aim for Vex again,
because you're one of the few out of its area.

3514
04:00:33,573 --> 04:00:41,548
Okay. Vex, I need you to make another dexterity
saving throw.

3515
04:00:41,548 --> 04:00:46,865
MARISHA: Fucking make this shit. Make it!

3516
04:00:46,865 --> 04:00:48,426
LAURA: 14.

3517
04:00:48,426 --> 04:00:54,805
MATT: 14? Okay. You keep rolling high. It's
interesting, I'm missing a bunch of different rays

3518
04:00:54,805 --> 04:01:00,181
because they aren't even doing anything. Well,
this one, however: a similar black ray streaks

3519
04:01:00,181 --> 04:01:11,579
downward and slams into you. You take 55 points of
necrotic damage. All right, that is going to bring

3520
04:01:11,579 --> 04:01:13,360
it to Scanlan's turn.

3521
04:01:13,360 --> 04:01:20,336
SAM: I hoof it towards the altar as fast and as
far as my--

3522
04:01:20,336 --> 04:01:22,091
MATT: That's as far as you can get, there.

3523
04:01:22,091 --> 04:01:25,483
SAM: Shit. That's as far as I can go?

3524
04:01:25,483 --> 04:01:28,779
MATT: 25 feet. You're a gnome, man. Tiny little
legs.

3525
04:01:28,779 --> 04:01:30,821
SAM: Can he see me?

3526
04:01:30,821 --> 04:01:33,319
MATT: You don't know. We'll find out if you try
something.

3527
04:01:33,319 --> 04:01:40,587
SAM: As a bonus action, can I move a couple more
feet?

3528
04:01:40,587 --> 04:01:43,352
(laughter)

3529
04:01:43,352 --> 04:01:45,170
MATT: It doesn't work that way, buddy. Sorry.

3530
04:01:45,170 --> 04:01:49,402
SAM: All right, I'll give it a shot. We'll see if
he's looking at me. It doesn't look good, though.

3531
04:01:49,402 --> 04:01:51,681
Wow, that's a tight angle.

3532
04:01:51,681 --> 04:01:56,637
TRAVIS: I think you might be just out of it.

3533
04:01:56,637 --> 04:01:59,244
(cheering)

3534
04:01:59,244 --> 04:02:01,075
SAM: I'm going to cast Bigby's Hand.

3535
04:02:01,075 --> 04:02:03,370
MATT: Where?

3536
04:02:03,370 --> 04:02:07,475
SAM: And I'm going to do something unorthodox that
the DM is going to have to approve.

3537
04:02:07,475 --> 04:02:09,618
MATT: Okay. Where were you putting the hand, by
the way?

3538
04:02:09,618 --> 04:02:11,036
SAM: Around Grog.

3539
04:02:11,036 --> 04:02:12,443
MATT: Okay.

3540
04:02:12,443 --> 04:02:18,367
SAM: And I would like to swing Grog like a hammer
at the back of the thing.

3541
04:02:18,367 --> 04:02:21,328
MATT: You're fastball special-ing him with Bigby's
Hand?

3542
04:02:21,328 --> 04:02:22,374
SAM: Yes.

3543
04:02:22,374 --> 04:02:24,436
MATT: I am so about this.

3544
04:02:24,436 --> 04:02:26,695
(laughter)

3545
04:02:26,695 --> 04:02:31,590
SAM: It's a goliath hammer!

3546
04:02:31,590 --> 04:02:38,626
MATT: Okay, I want you to go ahead and make a
strength check. So roll a d20 and add eight.

3547
04:02:38,626 --> 04:02:41,903
SAM: 23.

3548
04:02:41,903 --> 04:02:51,377
MATT: Okay. The hand grabs Grog, rears back, and
just full strength, lobs towards the beholder.

3549
04:02:51,377 --> 04:02:57,960
Grog, you go flying up in the air with the added
strength of Bigby's Hand behind you. What are you doing?

3550
04:02:57,960 --> 04:03:02,521
TRAVIS: I'm just slashing as I'm flying through
the air.

3551
04:03:02,521 --> 04:03:14,545
MATT: Okay. You get plus eight onto each damage
roll from the force of Bigby's Hand.

3552
04:03:14,545 --> 04:03:16,991
ALL: Yeah!

3553
04:03:16,991 --> 04:03:22,042
TRAVIS: I would like to reckless attack, Great
Weapon Master, all three of these.

3554
04:03:22,042 --> 04:03:24,257
(laughter)

3555
04:03:24,257 --> 04:03:28,709
TRAVIS: All two of them. All two of them. So plus
eight.

3556
04:03:28,709 --> 04:03:31,426
MATT: Well, plus eight to damage, not hit.

3557
04:03:31,426 --> 04:03:32,483
TRAVIS: Plus eight to damage.

3558
04:03:32,483 --> 04:03:39,315
MATT: Yeah, so the first one? They're reckless
attacks, so you have advantage on them.

3559
04:03:39,315 --> 04:03:41,027
TRAVIS: 19?

3560
04:03:41,027 --> 04:03:42,800
MATT: 19 hits. Second attack?

3561
04:03:42,800 --> 04:03:44,502
LIAM: Slow motion.

3562
04:03:44,502 --> 04:03:48,240
TRAVIS: 22?

3563
04:03:48,240 --> 04:03:52,095
MATT: 22 hits. Go ahead and roll damage on them.
Oh, this is going to be nasty, man.

3564
04:03:52,095 --> 04:03:54,100
LAURA: Kill him, Grog!

3565
04:03:54,100 --> 04:03:55,304
MARY: Kill him!

3566
04:03:55,304 --> 04:04:04,266
TRAVIS: Five, 10, 18, 28, 36 for the first one.

3567
04:04:04,266 --> 04:04:06,857
SAM: Was that 26?

3568
04:04:06,857 --> 04:04:08,670
LAURA: 36 for the first.

3569
04:04:08,670 --> 04:04:09,734
MATT: Ooh.

3570
04:04:09,734 --> 04:04:19,206
TRAVIS: Nine, 14, 22, 32. Plus eight is 40.

3571
04:04:19,206 --> 04:04:20,885
SAM: Woo!

3572
04:04:20,885 --> 04:04:27,919
MATT: As you go streaking through the air, Grog,
arc once with the blade across the top, severing a

3573
04:04:27,919 --> 04:04:34,303
couple of the eyestalks. The second one tears
through it. Fails both of its saves with a three

3574
04:04:34,303 --> 04:04:35,382
and a two.

3575
04:04:35,382 --> 04:04:36,593
(cheering)

3576
04:04:36,593 --> 04:04:38,981
MATT: You give it a minus two strength. Its
strength is reduced by two more.

3577
04:04:38,981 --> 04:04:42,822
TALIESIN: Ooh, so you get another strength bonus.
You bump up one.

3578
04:04:42,822 --> 04:04:44,286
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3579
04:04:44,286 --> 04:04:50,780
MATT: However, you pass over, and also then
plummet immediately to the ground.

3580
04:04:50,780 --> 04:04:52,409
(laughter)

3581
04:04:52,409 --> 04:04:53,662
LIAM: He's fine.

3582
04:04:53,662 --> 04:04:55,212
MARY: He's so fine.

3583
04:04:55,212 --> 04:05:03,545
MATT: Falling prone. You take ten points of damage
from the impact. Halved to five-- well, no, it's

3584
04:05:03,545 --> 04:05:05,353
not bludgeoning damage, it's just falling damage.

3585
04:05:05,353 --> 04:05:06,590
TRAVIS: It's like a hard sneeze.

3586
04:05:06,590 --> 04:05:10,773
MATT: Yeah, you take ten points of fall damage and
are prone on the ground.

3587
04:05:10,773 --> 04:05:13,333
SAM: And Bigby's dissipates, I assume.

3588
04:05:13,333 --> 04:05:19,070
MATT: No, Bigby stays there, it's a bonus action.
Bigby's just chilling right there where you left it, so.

3589
04:05:19,070 --> 04:05:21,529
SAM: Oh! Okay. Great.

3590
04:05:21,529 --> 04:05:26,466
MATT: All right, great! That ends-- at the end of
your turn, Scanlan--

3591
04:05:26,466 --> 04:05:31,105
SAM: I would like to use my bonus action to
inspire, who's about to go-- Vex!

3592
04:05:31,105 --> 04:05:32,266
LAURA: Me!

3593
04:05:32,266 --> 04:05:34,607
SAM: Vex! Who's taking selfies of her--

3594
04:05:34,607 --> 04:05:36,243
LAURA: I was taking a snapsnot.

3595
04:05:36,243 --> 04:05:40,107
SAM: I will inspire her with a limerick:

3596
04:05:40,107 --> 04:05:47,742
Friends, I don't mean to sound bitter / But a
year ago, life was a shitter. / 'Til I picked up some dice /

3597
04:05:47,742 --> 04:05:51,904
With some friends! It was nice! / And
now, ah, I'm a Critter.

3598
04:05:51,904 --> 04:05:56,792
(cheering)

3599
04:05:56,792 --> 04:05:58,899
MATT: Those words make no sense to you, but it
sounds like a nice song.

3600
04:05:58,899 --> 04:06:00,447
(laughter)

3601
04:06:00,447 --> 04:06:04,601
LAURA: It didn't make any sense at all.

3602
04:06:04,601 --> 04:06:11,515
MATT: All right. So, at the end of your turn,
Scanlan, it's going to go ahead and use another

3603
04:06:11,515 --> 04:06:13,049
one of its eye rays.

3604
04:06:13,049 --> 04:06:17,543
SAM: Oh, Jesus. Should've healed myself. I'm
dead.

3605
04:06:17,543 --> 04:06:27,111
MATT: This one's going to be at you. Make a
constitution saving throw, Scanlan.

3606
04:06:27,111 --> 04:06:28,948
LIAM: Come on, Scanlan!

3607
04:06:28,948 --> 04:06:32,235
SAM: That's 11, right?

3608
04:06:32,235 --> 04:06:40,013
MATT: 11. You take 36 points of necrotic damage
from the enervation ray.

3609
04:06:40,013 --> 04:06:43,522
TALIESIN: He's not down! But he's looking pretty
rough.

3610
04:06:43,522 --> 04:06:45,192
(laughter)

3611
04:06:45,192 --> 04:06:47,302
MATT: All right, Percy, you're up.

3612
04:06:47,302 --> 04:06:52,219
TALIESIN: Okay! I'm going to circle around the
side of the wall.

3613
04:06:52,219 --> 04:06:54,830
MATT: There?

3614
04:06:54,830 --> 04:07:01,055
TALIESIN: Just buck myself against the wall. I'm
going to take a couple shots with Bad News.

3615
04:07:01,055 --> 04:07:02,560
MATT: Okay.

3616
04:07:02,560 --> 04:07:11,147
TALIESIN: For a first shot, I'm going to be
doing-- ah, fuck it, let's take a sharpshooter

3617
04:07:11,147 --> 04:07:12,641
shot. Let's see what happens.

3618
04:07:12,641 --> 04:07:14,041
MATT: Sure.

3619
04:07:14,041 --> 04:07:18,284
TALIESIN: That's 18, 19, 20, 23, 24, that hits.

3620
04:07:18,284 --> 04:07:19,553
MATT: That hits, yes.

3621
04:07:19,553 --> 04:07:30,715
TALIESIN: 25. So that does 11, 21 points of
damage?

3622
04:07:30,715 --> 04:07:34,243
MATT: Nice. Reload?

3623
04:07:34,243 --> 04:07:43,721
TALIESIN: Reload. Firing again. Also another
sharpshooter shot. 23?

3624
04:07:43,721 --> 04:07:45,141
MATT: 23 hits.

3625
04:07:45,141 --> 04:08:02,294
TALIESIN: That's better. That's-- oh, wow. So
that's 36 points of damage. Using my Action Surge.

3626
04:08:02,294 --> 04:08:03,750
Reloading.

3627
04:08:03,750 --> 04:08:05,124
MATT: Okay.

3628
04:08:05,124 --> 04:08:10,485
TALIESIN: Another Sharpshooter shot.

3629
04:08:10,485 --> 04:08:13,281
SAM: Kill him!

3630
04:08:13,281 --> 04:08:21,733
TALIESIN: That hits! That's the same, I have 13
for-- yeah, that hits. Six, seven, eight, nine,

3631
04:08:21,733 --> 04:08:23,501
ten, that's 26 points of damage.

3632
04:08:23,501 --> 04:08:27,269
MATT: Looking rough, man!

3633
04:08:27,269 --> 04:08:30,190
SAM: How's this thing still alive?

3634
04:08:30,190 --> 04:08:35,247
MATT: Beholders. (gunshot) Reload. (gunshot)
Reload a second time. (gunshot) Third and final

3635
04:08:35,247 --> 04:08:39,504
shot. Each time, blasting chunks out of its flesh.
You can now see, like, bits of teeth are shattered

3636
04:08:39,504 --> 04:08:45,198
from the impact. The eye's now bloodshot and dark.
Blood is, like, seeping from under the large eye,

3637
04:08:45,198 --> 04:08:46,499
it's like (groans).

3638
04:08:46,499 --> 04:08:51,027
TALIESIN: I reload one last time and I am going to
try and hide behind that column right over there.

3639
04:08:51,027 --> 04:08:54,885
WILL: Nice. Nice work, Percy.

3640
04:08:54,885 --> 04:09:01,062
MATT: At the end of your turn it's going to do its
third and final one. All right, this is going to

3641
04:09:01,062 --> 04:09:13,093
be at Zahra. No, Zahra, you're in its cone, so
it's not going to aim it at you. You're

3642
04:09:13,093 --> 04:09:14,225
paralyzed--

3643
04:09:14,225 --> 04:09:16,142
TRAVIS: (chuckles) "And you're paralyzed."

3644
04:09:16,142 --> 04:09:18,364
MATT: So, it's there-- Vex, you're up!

3645
04:09:18,364 --> 04:09:19,830
LAURA: Fuck!

3646
04:09:19,830 --> 04:09:28,532
MATT: Okay. Vex, I need you to go ahead and make a
dexterity check.

3647
04:09:28,532 --> 04:09:35,945
LAURA: Okay. 24?

3648
04:09:35,945 --> 04:09:37,537
MATT: Yeah, you're fine.

3649
04:09:37,537 --> 04:09:39,606
LAURA: 23, it's 23.

3650
04:09:39,606 --> 04:09:50,539
MATT: 23, all right. The interesting rays aren't
coming up, it's really pissing me off.

3651
04:09:50,539 --> 04:09:53,424
WILL: The interesting rays.

3652
04:09:53,424 --> 04:09:59,385
MATT: These are just, like, rays that just do
damage, there's ones that do cool stuff. All

3653
04:09:59,385 --> 04:10:01,047
right, Keyleth, you're up.

3654
04:10:01,047 --> 04:10:06,694
MARISHA: Okay. I forgot this last time; as a siege
monster, I can deal double damage to objects and

3655
04:10:06,694 --> 04:10:10,832
structures. I'm assuming this is a structure,
yeah? If I want to, like beat through it?

3656
04:10:10,832 --> 04:10:12,917
MATT: Yeah.

3657
04:10:12,917 --> 04:10:24,202
MARISHA: Okay, so I'm going to do a slam attack
through it. Come on! Ah, fuck. I don't know if

3658
04:10:24,202 --> 04:10:27,838
that stone'll respond. Oh, this is to the wall,
though, right?

3659
04:10:27,838 --> 04:10:29,949
MATT: The wall, yes. It has, like, no armor
class.

3660
04:10:29,949 --> 04:10:31,438
MARISHA: So 14.

3661
04:10:31,438 --> 04:10:33,805
MATT: Yeah, go ahead and roll damage. Double
damage.

3662
04:10:33,805 --> 04:10:36,912
MARISHA: To the wall. 2d8 plus five.

3663
04:10:36,912 --> 04:10:42,094
SAM: Keyleth, attack the monster, not the wall!

3664
04:10:42,094 --> 04:10:48,474
MARISHA: Five, so that's 24 damage. To the
ceiling.

3665
04:10:48,474 --> 04:10:51,730
MATT: The ceiling breaks as you move forward,
falling down.

3666
04:10:51,730 --> 04:10:56,751
MARISHA: I'm just going to try and once again
catch him in--

3667
04:10:56,751 --> 04:10:58,409
MATT: How many attacks do you have as the--?

3668
04:10:58,409 --> 04:11:01,185
MARISHA: I have two. I have a multiattack; I can
use two slam attacks.

3669
04:11:01,185 --> 04:11:05,143
MATT: True. So you do one slam attack to break it;
for a second attack you could attempt to--

3670
04:11:05,143 --> 04:11:08,016
MARISHA: To, like, punch the beholder into the
ground?

3671
04:11:08,016 --> 04:11:10,860
MATT: Oh, you can attempt to make a slam attack to
push it down, if that's what you're wishing to do.

3672
04:11:10,860 --> 04:11:12,257
MARISHA: That's what I want to do.

3673
04:11:12,257 --> 04:11:13,792
MATT: All right, go ahead and make the attack.

3674
04:11:13,792 --> 04:11:15,260
TRAVIS: Yeah! Yeah, yeah.

3675
04:11:15,260 --> 04:11:16,544
TALIESIN: Big money, no whammies.

3676
04:11:16,544 --> 04:11:23,324
MARISHA: Okay, okay, that's not bad, that's not
bad. 21!

3677
04:11:23,324 --> 04:11:34,211
MATT: That was awesome. Okay. 21, that definitely
hits. Let me just--

3678
04:11:34,211 --> 04:11:37,572
LAURA: Kill him, Keyleth!

3679
04:11:37,572 --> 04:11:45,255
MATT: There we go. All right, so actually, that
would be your athletics check.

3680
04:11:45,255 --> 04:11:47,677
MARISHA: I'll take it!

3681
04:11:47,677 --> 04:11:50,814
MATT: What was the athletics for the form?

3682
04:11:50,814 --> 04:11:53,444
MARISHA: (laughs) Oh. I guess I just have my dex?

3683
04:11:53,444 --> 04:11:54,467
MATT: Strength.

3684
04:11:54,467 --> 04:11:56,597
MARISHA: My strength? Which is a plus five.

3685
04:11:56,597 --> 04:11:59,933
MATT: Yeah, so, what's the total?

3686
04:11:59,933 --> 04:12:02,191
MARISHA: It was a total for my d20 roll?

3687
04:12:02,191 --> 04:12:03,115
MATT: Yeah.

3688
04:12:03,115 --> 04:12:04,602
MARISHA: That would be 18?

3689
04:12:04,602 --> 04:12:12,500
MATT: 18, that works. So no damage is dealt, but
you punch the Beholder down back onto the ground,

3690
04:12:12,500 --> 04:12:15,021
and you land at its side, right there.

3691
04:12:15,021 --> 04:12:17,588
LIAM: Is it on the ground or five feet above the
ground?

3692
04:12:17,588 --> 04:12:18,823
MARISHA: Am I, like, on top of it?

3693
04:12:18,823 --> 04:12:23,039
MATT: It's, like, five feet above the ground; it's
still within-- You're not on top of it per se,

3694
04:12:23,039 --> 04:12:26,648
because you didn't grapple, you slammed it. So you
land next to it, essentially.

3695
04:12:26,648 --> 04:12:28,066
SAM: Nice job, Thing.

3696
04:12:28,066 --> 04:12:30,643
MARISHA: Okay, so I just brought him down. Do I do
any damage?

3697
04:12:30,643 --> 04:12:32,758
MATT: You take six points of fall damage from the
impact. No big deal.

3698
04:12:32,758 --> 04:12:38,994
LAURA: Mmm, I shouldn't say it. Do you get to stay
as an earth elemental if you're right in front of him?

3699
04:12:38,994 --> 04:12:40,765
MATT: That's right, is it a magical ability?

3700
04:12:40,765 --> 04:12:44,224
MARISHA: Beast Sense? Beast Shape?

3701
04:12:44,224 --> 04:12:45,932
MATT: Checking right now.

3702
04:12:45,932 --> 04:12:50,824
MARISHA: I was wanting to, like, ride him, stand
on top of him--

3703
04:12:50,824 --> 04:12:54,334
MATT: Right, but as part of the-- that would be a
grapple, as opposed to a slam, so unfortunately

3704
04:12:54,334 --> 04:12:56,506
that wouldn't be the case. And for--

3705
04:12:56,506 --> 04:12:58,408
MARISHA: I would've had to, like, specify?

3706
04:12:58,408 --> 04:13:02,752
MATT: Wild Shape. "Magically assume the shape of a
beast." As you fall past its eye--

3707
04:13:02,752 --> 04:13:04,603
(groaning)

3708
04:13:04,603 --> 04:13:06,911
MATT: Keyleth returns to her normal form.

3709
04:13:06,911 --> 04:13:12,130
MARISHA: That sucks. I can't crawl backwards? I
can't, y'know, like-- butterfly effect?

3710
04:13:12,130 --> 04:13:16,965
MATT: No, that was the placement where you were
above it, unfortunately. All right. That ends your

3711
04:13:16,965 --> 04:13:18,971
turn, though. Zahra, you're up.

3712
04:13:18,971 --> 04:13:31,986
MARY: (sighs) All right. Oh, it's looking towards
me-- hmm.

3713
04:13:31,986 --> 04:13:36,552
MARISHA: Can I do a bonus action, then, if I fell
out of my form, and cast a spell as a bonus action?

3714
04:13:36,552 --> 04:13:37,906
MATT: Sure.

3715
04:13:37,906 --> 04:13:43,486
MARISHA: Can I cast Grasping Vine? No, wait, no,
never mind, I can't grapple.

3716
04:13:43,486 --> 04:13:46,172
SAM: Oi! Look at the guy right behind you!

3717
04:13:46,172 --> 04:13:50,998
MARISHA: Okay, I'll cast Healing Word on Scanlan.

3718
04:13:50,998 --> 04:13:52,803
TRAVIS: (laughing) There you go!

3719
04:13:52,803 --> 04:13:56,879
MATT: Okay! You go ahead and cast the spell, and
as you reach behind-- No effect.

3720
04:13:56,879 --> 04:14:03,867
MARISHA: Oh, son of a fuck, I'm in his fuckin'
front eye! God damn it. Shit-- cock-- balls--

3721
04:14:03,867 --> 04:14:05,517
TRAVIS: You've got, like, 12 healing potions!

3722
04:14:05,517 --> 04:14:07,921
LAURA: They don't work in front of him, right?
They're magic?

3723
04:14:07,921 --> 04:14:09,264
MARY: They're potions, though--

3724
04:14:09,264 --> 04:14:11,652
MATT: One way to find out. What are you doing,
Zahra?

3725
04:14:11,652 --> 04:14:17,798
MARY: All right, I'm going to... One, two, three,
four, five, six. I'm going back behind him.

3726
04:14:17,798 --> 04:14:20,234
MATT: You're aiming at the screen, I don't know
where that is.

3727
04:14:20,234 --> 04:14:21,272
MARY: Oh, say-- hey, where are you?

3728
04:14:21,272 --> 04:14:22,781
(laughter)

3729
04:14:22,781 --> 04:14:32,995
MARY: There. And then I'm going to use my Charred
Dark Staff, being right next to the

3730
04:14:32,995 --> 04:14:37,350
son-of-a-bitch, and I will use Witch Bolt one more
time, only because it's got the biggest amount of

3731
04:14:37,350 --> 04:14:41,054
damage. I'll use it at fifth level, so I'll still
have one charge left on my staff.

3732
04:14:41,054 --> 04:14:44,123
MATT: All right! So go ahead and roll a d20 with
your spell attack modifier.

3733
04:14:44,123 --> 04:14:48,204
LAURA: Okay, Zahra, you're going to get him. I can
feel it.

3734
04:14:48,204 --> 04:14:49,683
MARY: Natural 20.

3735
04:14:49,683 --> 04:14:52,033
(cheering)

3736
04:14:52,033 --> 04:14:55,703
WILL: That was three, baby! That's my Z right
there!

3737
04:14:55,703 --> 04:15:00,484
MATT: Go ahead and roll your damage. So that's
5d12.

3738
04:15:00,484 --> 04:15:01,619
MARY: 5d12.

3739
04:15:01,619 --> 04:15:03,837
SAM: Whoa! This could do it!

3740
04:15:03,837 --> 04:15:07,882
MARY: All right, these are all d12s.

3741
04:15:07,882 --> 04:15:09,335
LAURA: Those are all 12s, yes.

3742
04:15:09,335 --> 04:15:25,074
MARY: Okay. 19-- 35-- 35.

3743
04:15:25,074 --> 04:15:26,643
LAURA: Times two-- 70.

3744
04:15:26,643 --> 04:15:27,428
MARY: 70.

3745
04:15:27,428 --> 04:15:29,223
SAM: Whoa, wait, what? Two? Wait? Huh?

3746
04:15:29,223 --> 04:15:30,352
MARISHA: She critted.

3747
04:15:30,352 --> 04:15:34,234
MATT: All right, so it's 35 points of damage on,
from the five--

3748
04:15:34,234 --> 04:15:35,461
MARY: Plus two.

3749
04:15:35,461 --> 04:15:43,473
MATT: Well, the plus two's after. 35 times two, so
that would be 70 points of damage.

3750
04:15:43,473 --> 04:15:45,060
MARY: 72.

3751
04:15:45,060 --> 04:15:47,799
MATT: 72 points of damage.

3752
04:15:47,799 --> 04:15:49,213
All right, how do you want to do this?

3753
04:15:49,213 --> 04:15:52,855
(cheering)

3754
04:15:52,855 --> 04:15:56,083
MARY: Scanlan, how would you like to use Bigby's
Hand to do this?

3755
04:15:56,083 --> 04:15:58,404
SAM: Bigby's Hand is not doing it, you're the one
doing it!

3756
04:15:58,404 --> 04:16:06,627
MARY: I'm doing it, all right, I want to stick my
bloody staff into his eyeball and make him explode.

3757
04:16:06,627 --> 04:16:11,986
MATT: Okay. My token's not facing the right way.

3758
04:16:11,986 --> 04:16:14,309
SAM: I'll use Bigby's Hand to catch some of the
sinew and blood and--

3759
04:16:14,309 --> 04:16:15,803
MARY: (laughing) Some of the spewing!

3760
04:16:15,803 --> 04:16:22,240
MATT: All right, so. As you glance over at Scanlan
and give him that visual perspective of, "Let's do

3761
04:16:22,240 --> 04:16:29,042
this," you glance over, reach out your hand and
pull Bigby's Hand towards you. It streaks up and

3762
04:16:29,042 --> 04:16:33,784
grabs the back of the beholder like a baseball,
just palming it, thrusting it down towards you,

3763
04:16:33,784 --> 04:16:42,130
Zahra. Its mouth open, it reaches down, teeth
open, momentarily frustrated by the moment, it's

3764
04:16:42,130 --> 04:16:46,861
going to use this to try and bite down. As you
reach up, you slam your staff up into its mouth

3765
04:16:46,861 --> 04:16:54,858
and release the Witch Bolt at ground zero from the
inside of its body. The eye widens for a second as

3766
04:16:54,858 --> 04:17:01,750
the top of the staff pierces the upper part of its
palate, and with a burst of black and bluish

3767
04:17:01,750 --> 04:17:07,097
electrical energy, the entirety of its skull just
(explosion), just detonates from the inside,

3768
04:17:07,097 --> 04:17:14,553
sending chunks of slimy flesh and bone and
whatever brain matter resides inside the cranium

3769
04:17:14,553 --> 04:17:16,917
of this beholder scattering across the room.

3770
04:17:16,917 --> 04:17:19,055
MARY: Are we all covered in muck?

3771
04:17:19,055 --> 04:17:20,249
MATT: Yes, you are.

3772
04:17:20,249 --> 04:17:22,417
MARY: Yes!

3773
04:17:22,417 --> 04:17:25,241
WILL: Oil can!

3774
04:17:25,241 --> 04:17:29,786
LAURA: I immediately call out, help Kash!

3775
04:17:29,786 --> 04:17:32,493
MARY: Kash!

3776
04:17:32,493 --> 04:17:36,395
LIAM: And I start running to the edge. Kima! Are
you all right?

3777
04:17:36,395 --> 04:17:40,215
MARISHA: I run to the edge with Vax, since I saw
fucking Kima go over.

3778
04:17:40,215 --> 04:17:42,462
MARY: Can I go over and help Kash?

3779
04:17:42,462 --> 04:17:49,134
MATT: Yes. Well, as the beholder dies, the ray
eventually fades off-- And the tendrils retract

3780
04:17:49,134 --> 04:17:50,485
into the wall.

3781
04:17:50,485 --> 04:17:52,372
MARY: So I pull him up, pick him up.

3782
04:17:52,372 --> 04:17:54,786
LAURA: I run to look over the edge to take care of
Kima, too.

3783
04:17:54,786 --> 04:17:58,478
MARY: Covered in muck, I look at my brother and I
say, are you all right?

3784
04:17:58,478 --> 04:18:00,085
WILL: I'm all right, thank you.

3785
04:18:00,085 --> 04:18:03,931
LAURA: I'm pulling the rope out and trying to
lower it over the edge.

3786
04:18:03,931 --> 04:18:06,627
LIAM: I'm going down, I'm rappelling. Rappelling.
Rappelling.

3787
04:18:06,627 --> 04:18:08,485
MATT: You hear the voice echoing from inside:

3788
04:18:08,485 --> 04:18:12,882
"I'm all right! Relatively speaking."

3789
04:18:12,882 --> 04:18:16,652
MARISHA: Vax is coming down to get you!

3790
04:18:16,652 --> 04:18:20,142
LIAM: Hold on, yeah, yeah, I'll give a--
piggy-back you up, come on. Just wait a moment.

3791
04:18:20,142 --> 04:18:25,984
MATT: As you come down, pulling your dagger out
and using it as a torch, down in the inside as

3792
04:18:25,984 --> 04:18:37,458
you're lowered, you can see there are hundreds of
partially eaten corpses of those fish humanoids

3793
04:18:37,458 --> 04:18:46,242
that you encountered earlier, as well as what
appears to be various cradles of gathered slime

3794
04:18:46,242 --> 04:18:51,281
and putrescence, the real core of where this
Beholder had been existing at the

3795
04:18:51,281 --> 04:18:52,936
bottom of this tomb.

3796
04:18:52,936 --> 04:18:55,464
LAURA: If you'd gone down there, I would've jumped
right down there.

3797
04:18:55,464 --> 04:18:59,705
MATT: Kima's down there, currently holding one
shoulder. You can see, she's tended to herself

3798
04:18:59,705 --> 04:19:04,114
with her wounds for the most part on her own, but
just currently looks up, like, "I've got nothing."

3799
04:19:04,114 --> 04:19:10,050
As soon as you descend from the pit dangling from
the rope, she goes: "Okay! Good."

3800
04:19:10,050 --> 04:19:13,023
LIAM: Hold on, let's tie you up. Grog?

3801
04:19:13,023 --> 04:19:14,187
TRAVIS: Yeah?

3802
04:19:14,187 --> 04:19:18,657
LIAM: I'm going to tie her up, you're going to
pull her up first, and then throw it down and get me.

3803
04:19:18,657 --> 04:19:20,592
TRAVIS: Pull her up and throw her down?

3804
04:19:20,592 --> 04:19:25,136
LIAM: Yeah-- no! Almost! Just pull Kima up!

3805
04:19:25,136 --> 04:19:26,012
TRAVIS: Okay!

3806
04:19:26,012 --> 04:19:30,637
LIAM: Step two is coming! And I'm going to use
perception on this pile of bones down here as she

3807
04:19:30,637 --> 04:19:31,676
gets yanked up.

3808
04:19:31,676 --> 04:19:33,072
LAURA: Look for any loot!

3809
04:19:33,072 --> 04:19:34,981
MATT: Roll investigation.

3810
04:19:34,981 --> 04:19:36,916
MARY: Should we go to the tomb?

3811
04:19:36,916 --> 04:19:41,670
SAM: I'm chugging a greater healing potion while I
look around for any loot around the altar and

3812
04:19:41,670 --> 04:19:43,304
around the dead bodies.

3813
04:19:43,304 --> 04:19:44,292
MATT: Okay.

3814
04:19:44,292 --> 04:19:48,914
TALIESIN: Trinket, with me, if you wouldn't mind.
And we're going to walk up to the altar and push

3815
04:19:48,914 --> 04:19:50,812
the sarcophagus open.

3816
04:19:50,812 --> 04:19:58,127
MATT: Okay. So you guys move up and push the
sarcophagus open. As you guys slowly start

3817
04:19:58,127 --> 04:20:04,438
bringing Kima up, the rope itself tense with the
weight, 'cause she's wearing a lot of armor, but

3818
04:20:04,438 --> 04:20:12,487
it manages to pull her up without issue. You go
ahead to the top of the sarcophagus there and it

3819
04:20:12,487 --> 04:20:19,419
is covered in black feathers, some of which got
pushed off in the battle. You shove the top open

3820
04:20:19,419 --> 04:20:29,852
and you can see inside a skeletal corpse that is
resting, surrounded by what looks like very, very

3821
04:20:29,852 --> 04:20:37,715
fine golden and silver jewelry that have just been
laid at its sides. And on the corpse itself, you

3822
04:20:37,715 --> 04:20:46,463
can see there is a set of jet-black studded
leather armor that has a series of runic

3823
04:20:46,463 --> 04:20:53,031
engravings and carvings along pretty much every
square inch of the leather. And you can see around

3824
04:20:53,031 --> 04:20:59,038
the the mantle of it, where the leather
mantle falls, the edge is trimmed with black feathers.

3825
04:20:59,038 --> 04:21:01,305
MARISHA: That's hot.

3826
04:21:01,305 --> 04:21:02,759
TRAVIS: That's fuckin' sick.

3827
04:21:02,759 --> 04:21:05,371
LIAM: That's some Labyrinth of Jareth shit right
there.

3828
04:21:05,371 --> 04:21:06,991
TRAVIS: Artists, go!

3829
04:21:06,991 --> 04:21:08,609
MATT: Make an investigation check.

3830
04:21:08,609 --> 04:21:10,752
LIAM: 15, a very average 15.

3831
04:21:10,752 --> 04:21:11,774
MATT: 15?

3832
04:21:11,774 --> 04:21:20,094
LAURA: I'm trying to-- Brother, I'm going to go
look at the stuff that they're finding, okay? Be safe!

3833
04:21:20,094 --> 04:21:22,527
LIAM: Okay. I'm looking through some bones.

3834
04:21:22,527 --> 04:21:24,287
LAURA: And I run over to the sarcophagus.

3835
04:21:24,287 --> 04:21:31,429
MATT: You find what looks to be-- roughly, within
the brief time you've spent, and you've spent like

3836
04:21:31,429 --> 04:21:35,288
a good ten minutes kind of, like, combing through
the slime, you find about six gold pieces.

3837
04:21:35,288 --> 04:21:38,227
LIAM: Oh, wow. Are there any fish-guy bones?

3838
04:21:38,227 --> 04:21:39,872
MATT: Plenty of fish-guy bones, yeah!

3839
04:21:39,872 --> 04:21:42,250
LIAM: I play a couple of them on the wall. Do a
little song.

3840
04:21:42,250 --> 04:21:45,732
MATT: All right. It's beautiful with the echo, it
gives it this sort of reverberation effect to it.

3841
04:21:45,732 --> 04:21:48,358
WILL: Kash walks over and heals Kima.

3842
04:21:48,358 --> 04:21:53,255
MATT: Okay, as Kima gets pulled over the edge, you
reach over and help. She's like, "Thanks,

3843
04:21:53,255 --> 04:21:58,413
"appreciate that, I-- that didn't go as planned.
I'm a little embarrassed."

3844
04:21:58,413 --> 04:22:00,734
LAURA: (laughs) All good, Kima!

3845
04:22:00,734 --> 04:22:05,087
MATT: "It was a very long fall! And I survived
that--"

3846
04:22:05,087 --> 04:22:08,917
TRAVIS: You did! Did you feel anything squish when
you landed?

3847
04:22:08,917 --> 04:22:10,905
MATT: "Eh, nothing I couldn't handle."

3848
04:22:10,905 --> 04:22:12,525
TRAVIS: Did you black out?

3849
04:22:12,525 --> 04:22:13,976
MATT: "No."

3850
04:22:13,976 --> 04:22:15,946
SAM: Did you pee your underoos?

3851
04:22:15,946 --> 04:22:18,780
MATT: (laughs) Make an insight check.

3852
04:22:18,780 --> 04:22:25,096
TRAVIS: Shit, my insight's balls-- Five.

3853
04:22:25,096 --> 04:22:27,420
MATT: No, man. She owned that fall!

3854
04:22:27,420 --> 04:22:30,073
TRAVIS: Yeah, you's a badass bitch.

3855
04:22:30,073 --> 04:22:32,157
MARY: It was a heck of a scream as you went down.

3856
04:22:32,157 --> 04:22:33,191
LIAM: Grog!

3857
04:22:33,191 --> 04:22:34,051
TRAVIS: Yeah?

3858
04:22:34,051 --> 04:22:36,878
LIAM: Throw down the rope! Please?

3859
04:22:36,878 --> 04:22:39,842
TRAVIS: Oh, I so want to just throw the entire
rope down.

3860
04:22:39,842 --> 04:22:41,297
(laughter)

3861
04:22:41,297 --> 04:22:42,597
LIAM: Pretty please?

3862
04:22:42,597 --> 04:22:46,386
TRAVIS: Without holding onto the other end? No,
no, no, I know what he means.

3863
04:22:46,386 --> 04:22:47,580
LAURA: It's infinite rope!

3864
04:22:47,580 --> 04:22:51,036
TRAVIS: Yeah, but I would throw the whole thing
down. I throw it down to him.

3865
04:22:51,036 --> 04:22:56,068
MARY: Are there any beholder teeth left? Anything?
Any sort of--

3866
04:22:56,068 --> 04:22:59,767
MATT: I mean, there are chunks of, there are a few
full teeth that you could try and take.

3867
04:22:59,767 --> 04:23:05,927
MARISHA: Keyleth actually goes over and starts
doing her harvesting thing.

3868
04:23:05,927 --> 04:23:09,929
MATT: Not a whole lot left to harvest. Like, it is
destroyed. There's a few eyestalks that you could

3869
04:23:09,929 --> 04:23:11,044
probably pull.

3870
04:23:11,044 --> 04:23:13,135
MARISHA: Yeah, that's true, I'll check out the
eyestalks.

3871
04:23:13,135 --> 04:23:16,855
LAURA: Can we perception check the tomb and see if
it's safe to grab shit out of it?

3872
04:23:16,855 --> 04:23:18,792
MATT: Sure, go ahead and make an investigation
check

3873
04:23:18,792 --> 04:23:21,098
TRAVIS: Hey, Vax, you got that rope yet?

3874
04:23:21,098 --> 04:23:23,317
LIAM: Thank you!

3875
04:23:23,317 --> 04:23:28,010
TALIESIN: I'm going to-- Very gently, I'm removing
the leather armor from the body.

3876
04:23:28,010 --> 04:23:35,767
MATT: Okay, I need Vex, I need Percy, and I need
Trinket to all make dexterity saving throws.

3877
04:23:35,767 --> 04:23:37,697
LIAM: Evil shit.

3878
04:23:37,697 --> 04:23:39,368
LAURA: One.

3879
04:23:39,368 --> 04:23:45,421
SAM: Dead. Instant death.

3880
04:23:45,421 --> 04:23:48,395
LIAM: Why are you rolling twice?

3881
04:23:48,395 --> 04:23:49,874
LAURA: For Trinket!

3882
04:23:49,874 --> 04:23:52,990
TALIESIN: I'm going to use one of my re-reroll a
saving throw.

3883
04:23:52,990 --> 04:23:56,170
LAURA: Six for Trinket! It's a good night, you
guys.

3884
04:23:56,170 --> 04:24:06,923
SAM: Did I find any loot in the bodies of the
losers? The little guys?

3885
04:24:06,923 --> 04:24:14,806
MATT: You find a bunch of shitty spears, crappy
leather, and through all them all, about 12 gold pieces.

3886
04:24:14,806 --> 04:24:19,120
TALIESIN: That can almost buy a book. 21.

3887
04:24:19,120 --> 04:24:26,003
MATT: You manage, as you reach out and grab for
the armor, as your fingers touch it, there's this

3888
04:24:26,003 --> 04:24:31,756
vibration and it seems like the shadows, the
nearby shadows in the corners, seem to reach up

3889
04:24:31,756 --> 04:24:37,102
towards your hands. You pull back in time, but you
and Trinket notice a little too late as there's a

3890
04:24:37,102 --> 04:24:45,255
burst of death. A burst of death energy that just
bursts out for a ten-foot radius around the entire

3891
04:24:45,255 --> 04:24:54,113
sarcophagus. You avoid it. Both you and Trinket
suffer 56 points of necrotic damage.

3892
04:24:54,113 --> 04:24:57,415
LAURA: I'm unconscious. Trinket--

3893
04:24:57,415 --> 04:24:59,684
MATT: Does that bring you below zero?

3894
04:24:59,684 --> 04:25:04,881
LAURA: Yeah.

3895
04:25:04,881 --> 04:25:11,469
MATT: Vex's body falls and hits the stonework, and
you look over as you see her eyes stare up, the

3896
04:25:11,469 --> 04:25:16,438
last bit of air escaping from her lungs as the
life drips out of her form.

3897
04:25:16,438 --> 04:25:17,878
TALIESIN: Oh shit.

3898
04:25:17,878 --> 04:25:19,069
MARY: What?

3899
04:25:19,069 --> 04:25:20,536
LIAM: What's going on?

3900
04:25:20,536 --> 04:25:21,789
TALIESIN: Running over.

3901
04:25:21,789 --> 04:25:26,956
MARY: What? Running over, pouring a healing potion
in her mouth, instantly, as quickly as possible.

3902
04:25:26,956 --> 04:25:28,540
WILL: I can revive her too.

3903
04:25:28,540 --> 04:25:30,104
MARY: Kash, do something.

3904
04:25:30,104 --> 04:25:35,016
MATT: The healing potion has no effect, and as you
go to her, you can already feel the clutch to her

3905
04:25:35,016 --> 04:25:38,118
skin. Her body is instantly cold from the necrotic
blast.

3906
04:25:38,118 --> 04:25:39,773
MARISHA: Kashaw!

3907
04:25:39,773 --> 04:25:45,229
MATT: You glance over at the sudden intense energy
of the room and see your sister lying cold and

3908
04:25:45,229 --> 04:25:47,333
lifeless on the ground, being cradled by Zahra.

3909
04:25:47,333 --> 04:25:48,621
LIAM: The fuck happened?

3910
04:25:48,621 --> 04:25:49,972
MARY: Kash, Kash, Kash.

3911
04:25:49,972 --> 04:25:51,226
WILL: I can raise the dead.

3912
04:25:51,226 --> 04:25:52,589
LIAM: I run over.

3913
04:25:52,589 --> 04:25:58,521
WILL: I can revivify or I can raise the dead.

3914
04:25:58,521 --> 04:25:59,785
MARISHA: Revivify, revivify.

3915
04:25:59,785 --> 04:26:01,790
WILL: Let's do it.

3916
04:26:01,790 --> 04:26:06,685
LIAM: I'm already running over. I'm picking her
up. What happened? I was only down

3917
04:26:06,685 --> 04:26:08,078
there for 30 seconds.

3918
04:26:08,078 --> 04:26:09,629
MATT: Do you have it prepared?

3919
04:26:09,629 --> 04:26:11,371
WILL: What do you mean?

3920
04:26:11,371 --> 04:26:13,453
MATT: Do you have it prepared as one of your
prepared spells?

3921
04:26:13,453 --> 04:26:14,928
WILL: I believe so, yeah.

3922
04:26:14,928 --> 04:26:16,939
MATT: Check your list to see if it has a little
dot next to it.

3923
04:26:16,939 --> 04:26:20,757
LIAM: I'm pouring a healing potion in her mouth.
I'm pouring a greater potion in her mouth.

3924
04:26:20,757 --> 04:26:23,791
MATT: Okay. No effect.

3925
04:26:23,791 --> 04:26:26,231
LIAM: The fuck is going on?

3926
04:26:26,231 --> 04:26:27,375
WILL: Yes, I do.

3927
04:26:27,375 --> 04:26:28,535
TALIESIN: Do it. Do it.

3928
04:26:28,535 --> 04:26:29,689
WILL: I do. I have it prepared.

3929
04:26:29,689 --> 04:26:31,253
SAM: It's true. It's written down. It's true.

3930
04:26:31,253 --> 04:26:32,524
TALIESIN: Do it.

3931
04:26:32,524 --> 04:26:34,122
WILL: And I have third levels left.

3932
04:26:34,122 --> 04:26:35,038
TALIESIN: Do it.

3933
04:26:35,038 --> 04:26:36,308
MARISHA: Oh my God, I'm shaking.

3934
04:26:36,308 --> 04:26:38,059
WILL: I can bring her back.

3935
04:26:38,059 --> 04:26:44,979
MATT: You rush over. You reach in your pouch and
pull out a bit of clustered diamonds in your hand

3936
04:26:44,979 --> 04:26:49,070
that you keep just in case for such a
circumstance, and as you place them out, you

3937
04:26:49,070 --> 04:26:52,483
sprinkle them across her chest, pushing Vax a
little bit away, knowing that you need the

3938
04:26:52,483 --> 04:27:01,040
concentration on this, at which point you pull up
the symbol, and this type of magic, life and death

3939
04:27:01,040 --> 04:27:10,189
magic, draws a little closer than you feel
comfortable with Vesh, and you realize at this

3940
04:27:10,189 --> 04:27:15,292
moment that you're going to have to make the
choice to possibly call her attention forth.

3941
04:27:15,292 --> 04:27:17,737
SAM: Call whose attention forth?

3942
04:27:17,737 --> 04:27:21,774
LIAM: What are you hesitating for? Do it. Whatever
the fuck you're going to do, do it.

3943
04:27:21,774 --> 04:27:24,729
WILL: She could destroy everything.

3944
04:27:24,729 --> 04:27:26,112
LIAM: Do it.

3945
04:27:26,112 --> 04:27:27,938
MARISHA: What do you mean, she could destroy? What
do you mean?

3946
04:27:27,938 --> 04:27:29,119
SAM: Who's she?

3947
04:27:29,119 --> 04:27:31,729
WILL: I mean the dragons are going to be the least
of your fears if she comes back.

3948
04:27:31,729 --> 04:27:33,041
That's what I mean.

3949
04:27:33,041 --> 04:27:34,509
MARISHA: Kashaw, you're running out of time.

3950
04:27:34,509 --> 04:27:35,776
SAM: Who's she?

3951
04:27:35,776 --> 04:27:37,370
WILL: I'm going to bring her back.

3952
04:27:37,370 --> 04:27:47,764
MATT: Okay. So, we're going to do a quick ritual
skill challenge as part of this revivify

3953
04:27:47,764 --> 04:27:53,924
enchantment. So as you grasp the symbol, and as
you do, you can see all of the scars across your

3954
04:27:53,924 --> 04:28:00,380
forearm begin to light with a deep red crimson
energy, just (hissing sound), and you close your

3955
04:28:00,380 --> 04:28:04,785
eyes, and as you look up, you can see Kash's eyes
just go straight black, and this dark energy

3956
04:28:04,785 --> 04:28:08,851
begins to swirl off, and as it reaches out, it
touches the diamonds, which then shatter upon

3957
04:28:08,851 --> 04:28:15,063
impact, and the dark energy seeps into your
sister's corpse. The back arches, though she does

3958
04:28:15,063 --> 04:28:19,438
not register on the face or any of her movement.
Her body lifts slightly in place, her arms just

3959
04:28:19,438 --> 04:28:25,526
draped, dangling and scraping against the stone
beneath her as she's elevated there. How do you

3960
04:28:25,526 --> 04:28:27,958
guys want to help with this ritual?

3961
04:28:27,958 --> 04:28:36,167
TALIESIN: I take out three of my shards of
residuum, and I place them in where the crystals

3962
04:28:36,167 --> 04:28:38,218
are as an extra offering.

3963
04:28:38,218 --> 04:28:42,622
MATT: Okay, so you place the residuum across where
the diamond dust was shattered and use that as

3964
04:28:42,622 --> 04:28:47,698
almost a focus for the energy from the spell. All
right, I need you to go ahead and roll an

3965
04:28:47,698 --> 04:28:53,384
intelligence check. Just roll a d20 and add your
intelligence modifier.

3966
04:28:53,384 --> 04:28:59,325
LAURA: I'm going to throw up. Oh no.

3967
04:28:59,325 --> 04:29:03,636
TALIESIN: I can use my rerolls as well, correct? I
can't use my--

3968
04:29:03,636 --> 04:29:06,061
MATT: That's for saving throws, not for ability
checks. What did you roll?

3969
04:29:06,061 --> 04:29:07,135
TALIESIN: Six.

3970
04:29:07,135 --> 04:29:13,833
MATT: Six. The energy itself vibrates within the
glass shards, which then shatter, seemingly not

3971
04:29:13,833 --> 04:29:17,293
able to focus the energy of the spell.

3972
04:29:17,293 --> 04:29:22,998
MARY: I take my enchanted moonstone from my staff
and place it next to her.

3973
04:29:22,998 --> 04:29:30,591
MATT: Okay, so as you take the moonstone, and--
are you speaking to your patron to aid with this?

3974
04:29:30,591 --> 04:29:32,238
MARY: I am.

3975
04:29:32,238 --> 04:29:35,456
MATT: All right, so as you take the moonstone and
hold it aloft, you place it near the focus of

3976
04:29:35,456 --> 04:29:43,744
Kashaw's ritual. The dull white glow begins to
intermingle with the dark, shattered energy of

3977
04:29:43,744 --> 04:29:51,482
Vesh's grant, and as they impact, it creates this
strange grey swirl. I need you to go ahead and

3978
04:29:51,482 --> 04:29:56,995
roll an arcana check. Roll a d20 and add your
arcana skill to it.

3979
04:29:56,995 --> 04:30:00,454
LIAM: Depending on what she does, I'd like to do
something next.

3980
04:30:00,454 --> 04:30:02,031
LAURA: (whispered) That's good. That's good.

3981
04:30:02,031 --> 04:30:02,986
MARY: 17.

3982
04:30:02,986 --> 04:30:08,670
MATT: Okay. The grey balances, and where the two
meet now, there is just grey energy seeping into

3983
04:30:08,670 --> 04:30:15,137
her body. You, focusing, look up at the altar
where the body was, and you see the very faint

3984
04:30:15,137 --> 04:30:27,322
drifting image of a dark female form looking on.
Who wants to make the third and final attempt to aid?

3985
04:30:27,322 --> 04:30:28,234
SAM: I will--

3986
04:30:28,234 --> 04:30:29,372
LIAM: I do.

3987
04:30:29,372 --> 04:30:31,437
SAM: Oh, sure, I will let you do that.

3988
04:30:31,437 --> 04:30:46,325
LIAM: I pull my sister in close, and I say, take
me instead, you raven bitch.

3989
04:30:46,325 --> 04:30:56,858
MATT: Go ahead and make a persuasion check. With
advantage.

3990
04:30:56,858 --> 04:30:58,679
LIAM: 11.

3991
04:30:58,679 --> 04:31:11,613
MATT: 11. Okay. At this point, the dark female
form that drifts from the altar, you glancing up

3992
04:31:11,613 --> 04:31:20,436
intently, feeling the sudden intense, fearful gaze
of Vesh upon you. As it gets closer and closer,

3993
04:31:20,436 --> 04:31:27,480
the presence is different. What you feared was
Vesh is not Vesh, actually. It is an image, a

3994
04:31:27,480 --> 04:31:37,263
specter of the Raven Queen herself. The face is
formless at this proximity. You can't make any

3995
04:31:37,263 --> 04:31:44,690
details. It's just this perpetually blurred female
form of a face. The hair just tumbles down past,

3996
04:31:44,690 --> 04:31:59,686
and as it steps forward, no expression, no words.
The hand reaches out towards you, Vax. There's a

3997
04:31:59,686 --> 04:32:15,016
nod. The magic strengthens, focusing through your
moon crystal into Vax's body.

3998
04:32:15,016 --> 04:32:32,495
I'll take a picture of this so that no one
questions this. A moment passes.

3999
04:32:32,495 --> 04:32:38,296
A second moment passes.

4000
04:32:38,296 --> 04:32:50,114
The vision of the Raven Queen nods the head to
you, steps backward, and the specter vanishes.

4001
04:32:50,114 --> 04:32:57,079
(gasping) Breath fills Vex's lungs as she begins
to cough, her form drifting back to the stonework.

4002
04:32:57,079 --> 04:33:06,929
Your vision clears, and you find yourself looking
up at the partially broken stone ceiling of the

4003
04:33:06,929 --> 04:33:13,142
dark altar into the face of your brother, tears
streaming down his face, the rest of your friends

4004
04:33:13,142 --> 04:33:14,501
gathered around.

4005
04:33:14,501 --> 04:33:16,115
LAURA: What happened?

4006
04:33:16,115 --> 04:33:19,338
MARY: Hello, darling.

4007
04:33:19,338 --> 04:33:20,946
LAURA: I feel so cold.

4008
04:33:20,946 --> 04:33:22,607
LIAM: You were knocked out.

4009
04:33:22,607 --> 04:33:23,913
LAURA: Knocked out?

4010
04:33:23,913 --> 04:33:24,979
LIAM: Yeah.

4011
04:33:24,979 --> 04:33:29,216
LAURA: (sighs) Well, that was a close one.
(laughs) Did we find anything?

4012
04:33:29,216 --> 04:33:49,649
MARISHA: I reach out, and I touch Vax on his back.
Do I feel or sense anything different?

4013
04:33:49,649 --> 04:33:53,957
MATT: No.

4014
04:33:53,957 --> 04:33:56,509
LAURA: (exaggerated sobbing) God.

4015
04:33:56,509 --> 04:34:02,898
MARY: I take my stone and put it back in my
staff.

4016
04:34:02,898 --> 04:34:06,505
LAURA: Why are you crying?

4017
04:34:06,505 --> 04:34:09,591
LIAM: I'm not crying, stupid.

4018
04:34:09,591 --> 04:34:14,705
WILL: I'm all right. You people suck.

4019
04:34:14,705 --> 04:34:21,925
SAM: I just hand Vex 30 gold and say, sorry about
before.

4020
04:34:21,925 --> 04:34:24,541
LAURA: What happened?

4021
04:34:24,541 --> 04:34:26,382
TRAVIS: You fucking died.

4022
04:34:26,382 --> 04:34:28,863
MARY: Grog.

4023
04:34:28,863 --> 04:34:32,908
TRAVIS: Yeah. We turned around. I pull your
brother out of the pit, and you're laying there

4024
04:34:32,908 --> 04:34:34,476
lifeless on the floor.

4025
04:34:34,476 --> 04:34:35,664
LAURA: What?

4026
04:34:35,664 --> 04:34:42,258
MATT: At which point, you immediately have this
perpetual slapping of wet bear tongue across your

4027
04:34:42,258 --> 04:34:49,304
face as Trinket is just (bear noises) nuzzling up
against you and, like, pressing all his weight

4028
04:34:49,304 --> 04:34:52,511
against your body to an almost intense degree.

4029
04:34:52,511 --> 04:34:58,561
LAURA: All right, all right. Your breath is
lovely. Okay. How did I--

4030
04:34:58,561 --> 04:35:00,158
TRAVIS: How do you feel?

4031
04:35:00,158 --> 04:35:02,735
LAURA: I feel-- I feel cold?

4032
04:35:02,735 --> 04:35:05,320
MARY: Here, take my cape.

4033
04:35:05,320 --> 04:35:08,673
LAURA: How am I not dead, then, if I died--?

4034
04:35:08,673 --> 04:35:12,528
TRAVIS: That's a good question. Vax, how are you
feeling?

4035
04:35:12,528 --> 04:35:15,639
LAURA: (softly) Vax--

4036
04:35:15,639 --> 04:35:18,968
LIAM: I walk out of the chamber.

4037
04:35:18,968 --> 04:35:26,093
LAURA: Wait, Percy, did you set off a trap? Is
that how I died?

4038
04:35:26,093 --> 04:35:27,335
TALIESIN: Yes.

4039
04:35:27,335 --> 04:35:32,313
LAURA: (laughing nervously) Well-- who brought me
back?

4040
04:35:32,313 --> 04:35:36,031
SAM: Kash.

4041
04:35:36,031 --> 04:35:37,686
TALIESIN: And your brother.

4042
04:35:37,686 --> 04:35:39,021
LAURA: Oh.

4043
04:35:39,021 --> 04:35:40,452
TRAVIS: And Zahra.

4044
04:35:40,452 --> 04:35:41,600
LAURA: Oh.

4045
04:35:41,600 --> 04:35:50,580
MARISHA: I grab Kash by the hand and, just to him:
What does this mean?

4046
04:35:50,580 --> 04:35:54,283
WILL: To be honest, I have no idea.

4047
04:35:54,283 --> 04:35:56,622
MARISHA: How do you feel?

4048
04:35:56,622 --> 04:36:07,475
WILL:I feel okay. I hope the barrier that was
sealed has remained sealed, or this is the start

4049
04:36:07,475 --> 04:36:09,989
of very bad things.

4050
04:36:09,989 --> 04:36:11,734
MARISHA: Why did you do that?

4051
04:36:11,734 --> 04:36:14,157
WILL: 'Cause I knew you wanted me to.

4052
04:36:14,157 --> 04:36:22,604
TRAVIS: Hey, Vex, do you want any, like-- ale or
anything? You-- I got some, like, firewater?

4053
04:36:22,604 --> 04:36:25,269
LAURA: Yes! Yeah, yeah, give me some of that.
It'll warm me up.

4054
04:36:25,269 --> 04:36:26,448
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4055
04:36:26,448 --> 04:36:30,398
LAURA: We need to get those-- those leathers,
those vestiges or whatever, and get the--

4056
04:36:30,398 --> 04:36:31,711
out of here.

4057
04:36:31,711 --> 04:36:36,224
TRAVIS: Well, I think that was the problem, right?
Did we get it?

4058
04:36:36,224 --> 04:36:40,399
MATT: No, that's-- the moment you touched it is
when that blast went off.

4059
04:36:40,399 --> 04:36:43,321
TRAVIS: Right.

4060
04:36:43,321 --> 04:36:49,546
LAURA: Can we not-- can we investigate it and see
if there's any traps? I mean, how do we make sure

4061
04:36:49,546 --> 04:36:51,147
it doesn't happen again?

4062
04:36:51,147 --> 04:36:56,630
MARY: Well, let's keep you away from it for now,
darling. Have a sip of firewater, just to warm you up.

4063
04:36:56,630 --> 04:36:58,750
TRAVIS: Here, here's a big flask of firewater.

4064
04:36:58,750 --> 04:37:00,815
WILL: Can we read any of the runes that are on
the--

4065
04:37:00,815 --> 04:37:07,174
MATT: As you walk back up to the altar and look on
the inside, the corpse is dust. The blast,

4066
04:37:07,174 --> 04:37:13,831
whatever it was, while it didn't damage anything,
seemingly, the remains are dust. The armor is laid

4067
04:37:13,831 --> 04:37:20,780
there, same place it was when you found it, if a
little slumped in without any sort of something to

4068
04:37:20,780 --> 04:37:27,423
fill it out. Also, most of the jewelry that's
there has turned green and seems to have been

4069
04:37:27,423 --> 04:37:31,401
robbed of whatever precious metal it was once
contained. The only thing that sticks out to you

4070
04:37:31,401 --> 04:37:41,163
is what looks to be a black crystal that comes to
a point on one end. It has a loop on it like it

4071
04:37:41,163 --> 04:37:49,663
was part of a medallion or a necklace or some sort
of a loop to carry on a chain. Those are the only

4072
04:37:49,663 --> 04:37:51,492
two things you see within.

4073
04:37:51,492 --> 04:37:53,096
MARY: So the leather is gone?

4074
04:37:53,096 --> 04:37:55,356
MATT: No, the leather is there. The corpse is
gone.

4075
04:37:55,356 --> 04:38:00,926
MARY: Yes. All right. Is there any way to pick
this up without touching it? I mean, is there any

4076
04:38:00,926 --> 04:38:04,462
way to-- can I use Mage Hand to lift it?

4077
04:38:04,462 --> 04:38:09,401
MATT: Yeah, yeah. It's pushing the boundaries of
Mage Hand, but you can try.

4078
04:38:09,401 --> 04:38:11,344
MARY: I can hold up to ten pounds.

4079
04:38:11,344 --> 04:38:14,903
MATT: Yeah. It's full leather armor. You can
just-- I'd say--

4080
04:38:14,903 --> 04:38:17,217
SAM: I can assist, I've got Mage Hand as well.

4081
04:38:17,217 --> 04:38:21,028
TRAVIS: Look, I'm a giant tank and I've got a
super long, like, sword, I could try and give it a

4082
04:38:21,028 --> 04:38:23,278
pick-up if everybody backs away.

4083
04:38:23,278 --> 04:38:28,446
MARY: Well, what if I lifted it up and put it onto
your sword, and then you could carry it out that way?

4084
04:38:28,446 --> 04:38:30,867
TRAVIS: I was going to put it in the Bag of
Holding.

4085
04:38:30,867 --> 04:38:33,969
MARY: Oh, put it in the Bag of Holding? Can I lift
it up and put it in the Bag of Holding?

4086
04:38:33,969 --> 04:38:36,249
WILL: Again, can we read anything that's written
on it?

4087
04:38:36,249 --> 04:38:38,316
MARY: Well, we need it, that's what's going to
help you guys.

4088
04:38:38,316 --> 04:38:43,744
MATT: Well, all the runes are inscribed there; you
can make an arcana check. Or religion check, one

4089
04:38:43,744 --> 04:38:45,094
of the two, probably would.

4090
04:38:45,094 --> 04:38:50,245
MARY: I glance at it, I can read. I have Eyes of
the Runekeeper.

4091
04:38:50,245 --> 04:39:03,890
MATT: The language is a forgotten language. It has
been dead for-- probably since before the

4092
04:39:03,890 --> 04:39:10,655
Divergence. But your eyes clarify on it in the
arcane nature of your sight. You pick up phrases

4093
04:39:10,655 --> 04:39:19,698
throughout, and it is a tale of the creation of
the Raven Queen. It is a tale of her ascendance

4094
04:39:19,698 --> 04:39:33,185
from mortal to immortal. It is the history of her
penance for ascending and taking the throne of

4095
04:39:33,185 --> 04:39:38,867
another entity that was supplanted. It's just
seemingly a history tale that is woven in with a

4096
04:39:38,867 --> 04:39:44,871
very, very strong enchantment, and you see within
each one of these little runic sections, there are

4097
04:39:44,871 --> 04:39:55,071
mentions of elements: fire, ice, lightning, you
know, it runs through all these various elemental

4098
04:39:55,071 --> 04:39:59,021
arcane properties that are bound into this
enchantment. You're not entirely certain what the

4099
04:39:59,021 --> 04:40:00,267
nature of it is.

4100
04:40:00,267 --> 04:40:06,918
MARY: Well, do you want to put it into the Bag of
Holding and then deal with it later, when you're

4101
04:40:06,918 --> 04:40:10,324
up against these things?

4102
04:40:10,324 --> 04:40:12,011
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4103
04:40:12,011 --> 04:40:16,898
SAM: Matt, I just did an arcana check and got a
23; does that help us know anything at all?

4104
04:40:16,898 --> 04:40:21,922
MATT: Okay. It is very magical, it is very
enchanted, and I'd say, based on the circumstances

4105
04:40:21,922 --> 04:40:30,517
in looking at this, whatever the blast that was
set off here, the runic elements that maintained

4106
04:40:30,517 --> 04:40:35,026
that trap that were in the sarcophagus are
currently expended.

4107
04:40:35,026 --> 04:40:36,736
SAM: Okay. Let's take it!

4108
04:40:36,736 --> 04:40:40,960
MARY: All right, what about the jewelry and the
black crystal?

4109
04:40:40,960 --> 04:40:42,583
MATT: You can take the black crystal as well.

4110
04:40:42,583 --> 04:40:46,708
TRAVIS: It was the runic things in the sarcophagus
that set off that blast, not the leather itself?

4111
04:40:46,708 --> 04:40:51,840
MATT: You don't know. But there were two runic
circles within the inside of the sarcophagus that

4112
04:40:51,840 --> 04:40:57,078
were not visible when you first looked into it,
that are both now visible and expended of energy.

4113
04:40:57,078 --> 04:41:02,010
TRAVIS: All right, yeah, let's put it in the Bag
of Holding. You want to Mage Hand onto my swordy,

4114
04:41:02,010 --> 04:41:04,450
and then we shish-kabob it into the bag?

4115
04:41:04,450 --> 04:41:08,791
MARY: Yes, I'll take the crystal as well. Is that
the only thing-- the rest are all tarnished and

4116
04:41:08,791 --> 04:41:09,889
green, yes?

4117
04:41:09,889 --> 04:41:10,855
MATT: Yeah.

4118
04:41:10,855 --> 04:41:14,987
MARY: All right. So here's the black-- can I do an
investigation check on the crystal at all, or--?

4119
04:41:14,987 --> 04:41:18,196
MATT: You'd probably have to take some time with
it, like a short rest, to go ahead and ascertain

4120
04:41:18,196 --> 04:41:19,374
the nature of it.

4121
04:41:19,374 --> 04:41:25,721
MARY: All right. Well, maybe on the way back. I
don't know. Get some insight-- so here. Mage Hand

4122
04:41:25,721 --> 04:41:30,017
it up. There we are.

4123
04:41:30,017 --> 04:41:38,621
MATT: So you gather your findings, your first
retrieval of one of the Vestiges of Divergence a

4124
04:41:38,621 --> 04:41:49,217
success, barring difficult circumstances. You make
your way back out through the tomb.

4125
04:41:49,217 --> 04:42:02,314
MARISHA: I walk up to Vex. And I just say: you
know, he loves you very, very much. So very much.

4126
04:42:02,314 --> 04:42:05,282
LAURA: Thank you, dear.

4127
04:42:05,282 --> 04:42:14,010
MARY: I'm so sorry, but we still have to deal with
the water and getting out of here. A stone-- don't

4128
04:42:14,010 --> 04:42:17,132
we have a stone wall there? We still have to get
out.

4129
04:42:17,132 --> 04:42:21,720
MARISHA: I still have one more Control Water spell
I can do.

4130
04:42:21,720 --> 04:42:26,168
MATT: Yeah. Well, it wouldn't be an issue. We'll
say for the sake of story brevity, you guys make

4131
04:42:26,168 --> 04:42:31,212
your way up through the temple in relative
silence, just taking in the moments that have

4132
04:42:31,212 --> 04:42:36,337
transpired. Through the aid of Keyleth and the
rest of the party, you manage to make your way

4133
04:42:36,337 --> 04:42:48,541
back out the way you came, parting the remnants of
the Marrowglade Loch, and start making your way

4134
04:42:48,541 --> 04:42:52,548
back, in the darkened evening hours, towards
Vasselheim.

4135
04:42:52,548 --> 04:42:55,314
LAURA: We need rest!

4136
04:42:55,314 --> 04:42:58,072
MATT: Do you want to rest on the outside of the
loch here?

4137
04:42:58,072 --> 04:43:02,509
LAURA: I feel like we should maybe camp and sleep
and rest up and get-- I don't know,

4138
04:43:02,509 --> 04:43:03,766
it's up to you guys.

4139
04:43:03,766 --> 04:43:07,980
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, I think a little treeline rest
would be a good idea. Before we go anywhere else.

4140
04:43:07,980 --> 04:43:10,986
MARY: I pull Vex aside and say, walk with me for a
moment.

4141
04:43:10,986 --> 04:43:12,742
LAURA: Okay.

4142
04:43:12,742 --> 04:43:16,658
MARISHA: And I go with Kashaw.

4143
04:43:16,658 --> 04:43:18,639
MATT: Okay.

4144
04:43:18,639 --> 04:43:29,915
MARY: I'm not sure what just happened, but I need
you to know that you're very dear to me. I've only

4145
04:43:29,915 --> 04:43:37,749
known you for a short period of time-- At any
rate, while you were gone, and I'm not sure how

4146
04:43:37,749 --> 04:43:43,958
much time I'll be spending with you from now-- I
have something for you. After our fight with

4147
04:43:43,958 --> 04:43:55,081
Rimefang, I forged something for you as well. And
it is one Arrow of Dragon-Slaying. And I want you

4148
04:43:55,081 --> 04:44:02,254
to have this, if for some reason I'm not here, or
I can't help you. I want you to use this to do

4149
04:44:02,254 --> 04:44:04,709
whatever you can to get rid of these things.

4150
04:44:04,709 --> 04:44:10,911
LAURA: (whispers) Thank you, Zahra.

4151
04:44:10,911 --> 04:44:13,006
MARY: You're welcome.

4152
04:44:13,006 --> 04:44:15,589
LAURA: Want to kill it.

4153
04:44:15,589 --> 04:44:22,536
MARY: Yeah. I want you to kill it. And I want you
to write me and tell me how you did it. Details.

4154
04:44:22,536 --> 04:44:25,421
Lots and lots of details.

4155
04:44:25,421 --> 04:44:29,995
MATT: Now it's Keyleth and Kashaw--

4156
04:44:29,995 --> 04:44:42,061
MARISHA: You know, Kashaw, for a cleric, I was
concerned maybe you didn't believe in much at all.

4157
04:44:42,061 --> 04:44:55,264
And I was very unsure of how you got all of your
radiant powers, considering I didn't know what you

4158
04:44:55,264 --> 04:45:05,223
believed in. But you must believe in something. So
what is it?

4159
04:45:05,223 --> 04:45:15,154
WILL: I believe in life. That's all I was raised
to believe in, was life. When you're married to

4160
04:45:15,154 --> 04:45:21,559
death, it's pretty much all you have. And I didn't
believe in any actual person until I met Zahra.

4161
04:45:21,559 --> 04:45:30,442
She saved my life. She didn't have to, but she
did. And she started to teach me what it meant to

4162
04:45:30,442 --> 04:45:38,789
have family. I didn't really know what that was
like until I first saw you guys together. I

4163
04:45:38,789 --> 04:45:43,247
figured there was no way that was going to happen,
and then there she was, and suddenly I had a

4164
04:45:43,247 --> 04:45:51,252
sister. Once again I realized that, at the end,
life conquers all.

4165
04:45:51,252 --> 04:45:55,782
MARISHA: Well, you did our family a great service
today, and you didn't have to do that.

4166
04:45:55,782 --> 04:46:05,855
WILL: Yeah. Vax would've killed me. And like I
said, I believe in life-- mine, above all others.

4167
04:46:05,855 --> 04:46:12,905
He's a good guy, you know. And a hell of a
warrior. A little creepy, the way he's always

4168
04:46:12,905 --> 04:46:14,871
staring at you, but I can't really blame him.

4169
04:46:14,871 --> 04:46:22,065
MARISHA: You know, you're a good guy too, even
though you try really hard to pretend not to be.

4170
04:46:22,065 --> 04:46:25,600
WILL: Don't let that get out, I got a reputation.

4171
04:46:25,600 --> 04:46:29,702
MARISHA: Thank you. For everything.

4172
04:46:29,702 --> 04:46:37,549
WILL: There is something you have to do for me,
though. You got to go and kill these fuckers.

4173
04:46:37,549 --> 04:46:42,084
MARISHA: You actually think we can do it?

4174
04:46:42,084 --> 04:46:51,372
WILL: I don't really know, but I know that no one
else will be able to. I hope you can. That Grog

4175
04:46:51,372 --> 04:46:53,119
guy's fuckin' huge.

4176
04:46:53,119 --> 04:46:55,265
MARISHA: Yeah, he is.

4177
04:46:55,265 --> 04:46:59,766
WILL: Stay near him. Behind him, maybe.

4178
04:46:59,766 --> 04:47:01,199
MARISHA: Okay, yeah.

4179
04:47:01,199 --> 04:47:05,066
WILL: Or just stay near Vax. He'll look out for
you.

4180
04:47:05,066 --> 04:47:09,773
MARISHA: And thanks for looking out for me.

4181
04:47:09,773 --> 04:47:12,783
WILL: Yeah, you don't suck.

4182
04:47:12,783 --> 04:47:24,874
MARISHA: By the way, y'know, you didn't need to
apologize for stealing that kiss before,

4183
04:47:24,874 --> 04:47:28,607
it was fine.

4184
04:47:28,607 --> 04:47:33,208
WILL: Well, that's good to know. It was only my
second one!

4185
04:47:33,208 --> 04:47:35,858
MARISHA: What? Really? It was my first!

4186
04:47:35,858 --> 04:47:36,809
WILL: Really?

4187
04:47:36,809 --> 04:47:37,574
MARISHA: Yeah!

4188
04:47:37,574 --> 04:47:39,585
WILL: Well, between us we've had three kisses now,
I think we did pretty well.

4189
04:47:39,585 --> 04:47:41,128
MARISHA: Aww, yeah! High five!

4190
04:47:41,128 --> 04:47:43,749
WILL: Oh, right!

4191
04:47:43,749 --> 04:47:49,607
MARISHA: Question. Who was your first kiss?

4192
04:47:49,607 --> 04:47:52,089
WILL: That would be my wife.

4193
04:47:52,089 --> 04:47:54,610
MARISHA: Oh, sure, yeah.

4194
04:47:54,610 --> 04:47:55,610
WILL: Yeah.

4195
04:47:55,610 --> 04:47:59,501
MARISHA: Yeah, no, that makes sense.

4196
04:47:59,501 --> 04:48:02,212
WILL: (deadpan) Well, this has been pleasant.

4197
04:48:02,212 --> 04:48:03,800
MARISHA: Cool, yeah, no, it has been--

4198
04:48:03,800 --> 04:48:06,135
(laughter)

4199
04:48:06,135 --> 04:48:09,142
WILL: Very, very nice talking to you again. I'm
glad that it's not awkward at all.

4200
04:48:09,142 --> 04:48:13,020
MARISHA: I-- Yeah.

4201
04:48:13,020 --> 04:48:14,493
WILL: Okay. All right.

4202
04:48:14,493 --> 04:48:15,828
MARISHA: Well, I c-- we should probably--

4203
04:48:15,828 --> 04:48:18,656
WILL: I'm going to camp across the way from you
tonight, if that's all right. Just 'cause it's a

4204
04:48:18,656 --> 04:48:19,907
little weird, so.

4205
04:48:19,907 --> 04:48:21,197
MARISHA: That's fine. Okay.

4206
04:48:21,197 --> 04:48:22,305
WILL: All right. Cool.

4207
04:48:22,305 --> 04:48:26,254
MATT: As you guys head back, the rest of you have
gathered at the same camp set-up you had the night

4208
04:48:26,254 --> 04:48:32,219
before. Kima-- while you guys were doing this,
Kima's fixed a little bit of a meal at the base

4209
04:48:32,219 --> 04:48:38,872
and set up her own Bahamut arc of protection on
the tree below where you guys are set up. As

4210
04:48:38,872 --> 04:48:44,349
everyone gathers around, she kinda gets your
attention for a moment and goes: "All right, so

4211
04:48:44,349 --> 04:48:51,938
"best that I can understand, we have most of our
allies and many of the survivors at your place,

4212
04:48:51,938 --> 04:48:53,491
"right, in Whitestone?"

4213
04:48:53,491 --> 04:48:54,693
TALIESIN: Yes.

4214
04:48:54,693 --> 04:49:02,899
MATT: "While you're seeking most of these things,
that's where the bulk of our hope resides. This is

4215
04:49:02,899 --> 04:49:07,193
"also, you say, where Allie is, and where the rest
of the survivors of the Council are."

4216
04:49:07,193 --> 04:49:10,178
TALIESIN: Yes, everyone. Everyone that we could
save.

4217
04:49:10,178 --> 04:49:15,596
MATT: "Okay. Well, for the time being, I'm
probably going to head there and make sure that we

4218
04:49:15,596 --> 04:49:21,748
"have defense in case any of these dragons manage
to get some sort of wind that this is where their

4219
04:49:21,748 --> 04:49:28,843
"possible usurpers are. They're going to hit it,
and they're going to hit it hard. Want to make

4220
04:49:28,843 --> 04:49:35,106
"sure that we have at least a decent chance of
defending these people. So I figure, all strength

4221
04:49:35,106 --> 04:49:41,770
"that we can spare, beyond those that are searching
for these artifacts, go and stay there at the

4222
04:49:41,770 --> 04:49:45,592
"moment. Besides, it'd be good to catch up with a
few friends, myself."

4223
04:49:45,592 --> 04:49:52,885
MARY: Lovely meeting you, Lady Kima. Come and find
me when you return to Vasselheim.

4224
04:49:52,885 --> 04:49:59,027
MATT: "You're welcome to join us in Whitestone. We
could use the help over there."

4225
04:49:59,027 --> 04:50:02,411
LAURA: Both of you?

4226
04:50:02,411 --> 04:50:09,228
MATT: "I can guarantee you, probably, seeing what
you guys can do today, we can definitely make use

4227
04:50:09,228 --> 04:50:14,607
"of that better over there than killing things for
cash here in Vasselheim. But to each their own.

4228
04:50:14,607 --> 04:50:19,087
"Just a noble cause. Helping your friends,
whatever."

4229
04:50:19,087 --> 04:50:22,634
MARY: I'd have to put it to the group of Vox
Machina. Is that all right with you?

4230
04:50:22,634 --> 04:50:24,857
LAURA: Yes! We'll meet you in Whitestone!

4231
04:50:24,857 --> 04:50:26,521
TALIESIN: Whitestone would be honored.

4232
04:50:26,521 --> 04:50:31,280
MARY: I'd be more than happy to. I'd be honored,
actually.

4233
04:50:31,280 --> 04:50:36,830
WILL: As would I, but-- damn, this is going to be
awkward now. We just had the whole big thing.

4234
04:50:36,830 --> 04:50:37,997
All right.

4235
04:50:37,997 --> 04:50:41,264
MARISHA: Well, I mean, we're-- we'd be passing
through, it'd be--

4236
04:50:41,264 --> 04:50:44,878
WILL: Yeah. Fair enough. We'd love to help. Just
the world and everything, so.

4237
04:50:44,878 --> 04:50:47,607
MARISHA: Just-- it'd be great, yeah. It's big.
It's a big, big world.

4238
04:50:47,607 --> 04:50:52,754
MATT: "And, just to put this out there, and I
don't mean to say this in any selfish way, but I'm

4239
04:50:52,754 --> 04:50:56,705
"really sick of sleeping in trees. Do you have one
of those tree travel things you have already to

4240
04:50:56,705 --> 04:50:58,749
"Whitestone? I could really use a bed."

4241
04:50:58,749 --> 04:51:01,219
MARISHA: Sure, yeah. Yeah.

4242
04:51:01,219 --> 04:51:03,925
LAURA: We could all head that way, actually.

4243
04:51:03,925 --> 04:51:05,305
SAM: To Whitestone?

4244
04:51:05,305 --> 04:51:07,825
LAURA: Do we need to go back, I don't know, sleep
for the night?

4245
04:51:07,825 --> 04:51:11,359
MARY: I think we could all use some rest, don't
you?

4246
04:51:11,359 --> 04:51:13,768
TALIESIN: We still have the Fire Ashari.

4247
04:51:13,768 --> 04:51:17,946
MARISHA: We do still have the Fire Ashari.
Granted, I could theoretically just tree back.

4248
04:51:17,946 --> 04:51:23,504
You guys want to go take a nap at
Whitestone?

4249
04:51:23,504 --> 04:51:25,606
LIAM and TALIESIN: Yes.

4250
04:51:25,606 --> 04:51:28,056
WILL: Could use a bed.

4251
04:51:28,056 --> 04:51:29,424
MATT: "Great!"

4252
04:51:29,424 --> 04:51:30,547
MARISHA: Tree Stride.

4253
04:51:30,547 --> 04:51:37,326
MATT: As the tree opens-- Teleport via Plants. As
the tree splits open, showing the portal, Kima,

4254
04:51:37,326 --> 04:51:40,421
whose eyes light up, looks over. "That--"

4255
04:51:40,421 --> 04:51:42,044
MARISHA: See? Yeah.

4256
04:51:42,044 --> 04:51:49,215
MATT: "Well played, druid. Well played." And she
charges through eagerly, and you guys all follow

4257
04:51:49,215 --> 04:51:54,740
suit out of the Sun Tree in Whitestone and find
yourselves a comfortable bed to sleep for the

4258
04:51:54,740 --> 04:52:01,540
evening. And that's where we'll call
tonight's game. I know it was long, but also, due

4259
04:52:01,540 --> 04:52:06,070
to scheduling shifts and, y'know, Will couldn't
stay for the next week, I didn't want to have to

4260
04:52:06,070 --> 04:52:09,121
leave in the middle of that, I wanted to give you
guys closure to the arc. So thank you for staying

4261
04:52:09,121 --> 04:52:10,441
for a long session.

4262
04:52:10,441 --> 04:52:13,065
TRAVIS: Happy-one-year-anniversary extended
edition.

4263
04:52:13,065 --> 04:52:16,048
WILL: One year. Congratulations to you guys.
That's awesome.

4264
04:52:16,048 --> 04:52:23,110
TALIESIN: We haven't had a near-death in ages! I
am so sorry! I am so sorry! Oh god.

4265
04:52:23,110 --> 04:52:27,867
LAURA: I had just rolled an investigation, before
I could even-- I had just rolled to check for

4266
04:52:27,867 --> 04:52:29,890
traps and then you pulled the stuff.

4267
04:52:29,890 --> 04:52:32,285
MATT: It's only the Champion of the Goddess of
Death, man.

4268
04:52:32,285 --> 04:52:37,158
LAURA: No, you know what? Thank you-- all of you--
for not--

4269
04:52:37,158 --> 04:52:39,039
MARISHA: (yells) What did you roll?

4270
04:52:39,039 --> 04:52:40,686
MATT: Huh? I rolled a 12.

4271
04:52:40,686 --> 04:52:43,527
LAURA: A 12, okay. What were you aiming for?

4272
04:52:43,527 --> 04:52:49,599
MATT: The DC starts at ten. Each failure increases
the DC by one, and a success lowers it by three.

4273
04:52:49,599 --> 04:52:57,908
So it had gone to 12, and the success had brought
it down to a nine. If I had rolled an eight or lower,

4274
04:52:57,908 --> 04:53:02,081
you'd have been gone for good.

4275
04:53:02,081 --> 04:53:04,066
LIAM: Would she or would I?

4276
04:53:04,066 --> 04:53:12,189
MATT: Well, she would've been gone for good. You
would've had to have made a very serious journey

4277
04:53:12,189 --> 04:53:15,329
elsewhere, possibly, to make that exchange.

4278
04:53:15,329 --> 04:53:17,361
MARY: What about Trinket?

4279
04:53:17,361 --> 04:53:23,221
LAURA: He survived, he didn't even go below zero
on that hit. I was just already at 41, so it

4280
04:53:23,221 --> 04:53:27,890
lowered me. He had four hit points left.

4281
04:53:27,890 --> 04:53:30,507
TRAVIS: The best part of that was that you were
totally out of the blast range, and you were like,

4282
04:53:30,507 --> 04:53:32,976
"I want to go be there when they open up the
sarcophagus." (explosion)

4283
04:53:32,976 --> 04:53:35,652
WILL: Yeah! She ran back! Totally!

4284
04:53:35,652 --> 04:53:39,884
LAURA: I know! No, believe me, I am aware that my
greed fucking did that to me. I am aware.

4285
04:53:39,884 --> 04:53:41,041
WILL: Life lesson.

4286
04:53:41,041 --> 04:53:43,513
MARY: And will she learn from this moment?

4287
04:53:43,513 --> 04:53:47,710
WILL: I thought for a second I hadn't written down
that spell, I was like, "Oh my god, wait, I didn't

4288
04:53:47,710 --> 04:53:50,135
"write, oh, yes, there it is, thank god." Oh my
god.

4289
04:53:50,135 --> 04:53:52,537
MATT: You still could've done Raise Dead, it just
would've been a little more expensive.

4290
04:53:52,537 --> 04:53:53,831
WILL: That's crazy, though--

4291
04:53:53,831 --> 04:53:56,470
MARISHA: Well, I thought Raise Dead just brought
them back, like, to life as a zombie, that's what

4292
04:53:56,470 --> 04:53:57,625
I thought.

4293
04:53:57,625 --> 04:54:01,538
MATT: No no no, no, Raise Dead is a proper, like,
resurrection-type spell. It just is really

4294
04:54:01,538 --> 04:54:07,876
expensive, and it's a ritual, there are
limitations to it. Revivify is good, but it has to

4295
04:54:07,876 --> 04:54:11,135
be used within a minute.

4296
04:54:11,135 --> 04:54:15,208
Which means when you used previously before
and we were in mid-combat, and I didn't want to do

4297
04:54:15,208 --> 04:54:18,239
the whole frickin' ritual in the middle of the
battle, so I let it go through.

4298
04:54:18,239 --> 04:54:20,413
MARISHA: Because Pike got on him next turn.

4299
04:54:20,413 --> 04:54:21,455
WILL: That's crazy.

4300
04:54:21,455 --> 04:54:25,289
LAURA: Ashley was texting as it was happening.
Like, "<i>No!</i>"

4301
04:54:25,289 --> 04:54:31,094
MATT: Thank you, Mary and Will, for--

4302
04:54:31,094 --> 04:54:33,251
TRAVIS: Thank you Mary and Will, yes!

4303
04:54:33,251 --> 04:54:37,328
MARISHA: And Mary, getting the "How do you want to
do this?" again!

4304
04:54:37,328 --> 04:54:38,915
MATT: Yeah! I know, man!

4305
04:54:38,915 --> 04:54:41,525
MARY: I like big beasts. And I--

4306
04:54:41,525 --> 04:54:44,935
MATT: That was, that was a good-- that was
delightful overkill. That was, like six points

4307
04:54:44,935 --> 04:54:47,202
left on that beholder. And you're like, "Oh, like
70-something."

4308
04:54:47,202 --> 04:54:50,925
MARY: Look, my timing is fucking perfect, though,
I always get either the Hellish Rebuke or the

4309
04:54:50,925 --> 04:54:55,201
Witch Bolt right. It's all about timing, is all.
Because he was really slashed up.

4310
04:54:55,201 --> 04:54:57,074
MATT: He was wrecked.

4311
04:54:57,074 --> 04:54:58,446
LAURA: Still.

4312
04:54:58,446 --> 04:54:59,536
MARY: Yeah, he was.

4313
04:54:59,536 --> 04:55:02,492
MATT: Guys, well done. Well, welcome back, glad
we're--

4314
04:55:02,492 --> 04:55:07,089
TALIESIN: Never sleep again!

4315
