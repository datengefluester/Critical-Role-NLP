MARISHA: Hi, everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role! Trinket's Honey Heist!

2
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:17,821
Oh my god. I would like to start off by saying
that this is terrifying. And that's it! So, let's

3
00:00:17,821 --> 00:00:24,383
get to our announcements really fast. I believe we
have a sponsor, right, Sam Riegel?

4
00:00:24,383 --> 00:00:28,688
SAM: We do have a sponsor tonight. Our sponsor
tonight is Marvel Puzzle Quest, friends of the

5
00:00:28,688 --> 00:00:33,988
show. Now, here's the thing. I was so excited
about the Honey Heist and having Marisha Ray as

6
00:00:33,988 --> 00:00:40,703
our DM, I forgot to write an ad for Marvel Puzzle
Quest. Don't worry, though. We're in good hands. I

7
00:00:40,703 --> 00:00:46,904
prepared for such an event. A long time ago, I
recorded a generic ad, so we'll just play that in

8
00:00:46,904 --> 00:00:51,493
its stead, because I didn't write anything
original. So guys, go ahead and roll that generic

9
00:00:51,493 --> 00:01:00,498
ad. Here it comes. Little delay. It's going
great.

10
00:01:00,498 --> 00:01:02,323
OFF-SCREEN VOICE #1: Hey big bro, what you doing?

11
00:01:02,323 --> 00:01:04,528
OFF-SCREEN VOICE #2: You're such a dweeb, little
bro. You haven't heard of--

12
00:01:04,528 --> 00:01:06,018
SAM: Marvel Puzzle Quest!

13
00:01:06,018 --> 00:01:08,245
#1: Sounds awesome, but wait. What's--

14
00:01:08,245 --> 00:01:09,519
SAM: Marvel Puzzle Quest!

15
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:11,106
#2: Dude, it's the best--

16
00:01:11,106 --> 00:01:12,307
SAM: Video game!

17
00:01:12,307 --> 00:01:13,635
#2: --I've ever--

18
00:01:13,635 --> 00:01:14,617
SAM: Played!

19
00:01:14,617 --> 00:01:17,208
#2: --It's so killer-diller, because it's got--

20
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:21,104
SAM: Features some of your Marvel teams, like
X-Men, Avengers, and Guardians of the Galaxy!

21
00:01:21,104 --> 00:01:22,289
#1: No way!

22
00:01:22,289 --> 00:01:24,221
#2: Way! And also--

23
00:01:24,221 --> 00:01:27,376
SAM: You can recruit Thor, from Thor: Ragnarok,
and Nightcrawler!

24
00:01:27,376 --> 00:01:29,890
#2: --which is way radical!

25
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,686
#1: Sounds tubular! Can I try your--

26
00:01:32,686 --> 00:01:34,556
SAM: Marvel Puzzle Quest!

27
00:01:34,556 --> 00:01:37,840
#2: Whoa, whoa, I don't let doofuses touch my--

28
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,284
SAM: Marvel Puzzle Quest!

29
00:01:39,284 --> 00:01:41,069
#2: --get your own!

30
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:43,718
#1: Me? But how? I'm not made of money!

31
00:01:43,718 --> 00:01:47,612
#2: You don't need to be, you dingus! You can
get--

32
00:01:47,612 --> 00:01:49,278
SAM: Marvel Puzzle Quest!

33
00:01:49,278 --> 00:01:50,674
#2: --for the low price of--

34
00:01:50,674 --> 00:01:51,850
SAM: It's free.

35
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,500
#1: Hold up! It only costs--

36
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,702
SAM: It's free.

37
00:01:55,702 --> 00:01:58,590
#2: That's right, nerd-face! The price is--

38
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,777
SAM: It's free.

39
00:01:59,777 --> 00:02:01,126
#1: Whoa! That's so--

40
00:02:01,126 --> 00:02:02,256
SAM: Affordable.

41
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:04,017
#2: I know! So get some--

42
00:02:04,017 --> 00:02:05,296
SAM: Marvel Puzzle Quest!

43
00:02:05,296 --> 00:02:07,221
#2: --for yourself at your local--

44
00:02:07,221 --> 00:02:10,071
SAM: Apple Store, Google Play, Amazon App Store,
and Steam!

45
00:02:10,071 --> 00:02:12,893
#1: Oh, you know I will, big bro!

46
00:02:12,893 --> 00:02:14,467
#2: Righteous, little bro!

47
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,816
#1: Sweet!

48
00:02:15,816 --> 00:02:16,812
#2: Boo-yah!

49
00:02:16,812 --> 00:02:17,618
#1: Dope!

50
00:02:17,618 --> 00:02:18,607
#2: Ch'yeah!

51
00:02:18,607 --> 00:02:19,922
#1: Whoomp, there it is!

52
00:02:19,922 --> 00:02:20,875
#2: Fucken!

53
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:21,635
#1: Phat!

54
00:02:21,635 --> 00:02:22,585
#2: Gettin' jiggy!

55
00:02:22,585 --> 00:02:25,425
SAM: This goes on for a while. Let's cut it
there!

56
00:02:25,425 --> 00:02:26,610
#2: Talk to the hand!

57
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27,675
#1: Ch'yeah!

58
00:02:27,675 --> 00:02:28,459
#2: Yeah!

59
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:29,402
#1: Ch'yeah!

60
00:02:29,402 --> 00:02:33,698
SAM: Sorry about that. It's a long one, guys.

61
00:02:33,698 --> 00:02:37,283
TALIESIN: You were so prepared. I don't feel well
anymore.

62
00:02:37,283 --> 00:02:42,218
BRIAN: I hope that the audio of that stuff didn't
end up on the stream, and they just saw you going,

63
00:02:42,218 --> 00:02:44,195
"Marvel Puzzle Quest!"

64
00:02:44,195 --> 00:02:48,511
SAM: That would be amazing. Sorry it took so long,
Marisha.

65
00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:58,359
MARISHA: No, anything to delay my impending doom.
Okay. Merch! Laura knows what's up, isn't that

66
00:02:58,359 --> 00:03:00,247
right--? Oh, Matt, you want to do merch?

67
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:04,818
MATT: Hi! I mean, the big news is that today,
available, we have the art book!

68
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:09,166
SAM: Oh my god!

69
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:10,722
LIAM: It's so beautiful.

70
00:03:10,722 --> 00:03:12,112
TALIESIN: It's full of stars.

71
00:03:12,112 --> 00:03:15,660
LIAM: Oh hi, Sam, have you seen our art book?

72
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,998
SAM: No, I haven't!

73
00:03:16,998 --> 00:03:18,081
LIAM: I can't open it now.

74
00:03:18,081 --> 00:03:19,353
TALIESIN: We cannot open the art book.

75
00:03:19,353 --> 00:03:20,584
SAM: You still can't even open it, now?

76
00:03:20,584 --> 00:03:23,641
LIAM: We're not going to show the audience the
insides! Oh my god!

77
00:03:23,641 --> 00:03:26,157
MATT: Show them one page?

78
00:03:26,157 --> 00:03:32,613
LIAM: One page? I don't know. We'd have to have
clearance or something, isn't that how it works?

79
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:36,846
MATT: I will provide clearance <i>right now</i>. For
one page! It's on sale today, come on!

80
00:03:36,846 --> 00:03:38,817
LIAM: Okay, okay.

81
00:03:38,817 --> 00:03:41,550
BRIAN: They can sue Matt Mercer.

82
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:50,007
LIAM: I guess, I guess. Shit, man. Let's do this
Percy page, this bomb-ass double Percy spread. Ooh!

83
00:03:50,007 --> 00:03:52,112
(yelling)

84
00:03:52,112 --> 00:03:53,343
MARISHA: Pretty bomb-ass!

85
00:03:53,343 --> 00:03:54,886
LIAM: Look at this gorgeousness!

86
00:03:54,886 --> 00:03:58,039
SAM: Security's coming down, they're going to shut
us down. Close it, close the book!

87
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:00,255
LIAM: Sorry, Rachel.

88
00:04:00,255 --> 00:04:04,864
MATT: I'll take the heat for it. Yeah, so that's
up.

89
00:04:04,864 --> 00:04:11,315
TALIESIN: These are now available for order.
They're beautiful and amazing and fabulous.

90
00:04:11,315 --> 00:04:16,005
MATT: I heard there was a bit of an issue earlier
today? A kerfuffle with international shipping?

91
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:17,934
But that has since been fixed.

92
00:04:17,934 --> 00:04:22,586
TALIESIN: Yeah, we have more or less evened that
out now, so there's currently a standard rate, I

93
00:04:22,586 --> 00:04:24,047
believe, for international shipping.

94
00:04:24,047 --> 00:04:29,498
MATT: And for people who've already paid, I
believe we're getting that fixed. Most today, and

95
00:04:29,498 --> 00:04:30,517
some tomorrow.

96
00:04:30,517 --> 00:04:31,769
TALIESIN: Yeah, there's a few that are a little
tricky.

97
00:04:31,769 --> 00:04:33,585
MARISHA: Why does it get so weird about books?

98
00:04:33,585 --> 00:04:38,165
TALIESIN: It's weird. They were showing me charts
and graphs to explain what happened this morning,

99
00:04:38,165 --> 00:04:41,768
and it was all very complicated, but it basically
boiled down to our standard Benny Hill

100
00:04:41,768 --> 00:04:43,088
ridiculousness.

101
00:04:43,088 --> 00:04:45,625
MARISHA and TALIESIN: (singing Yakety Sax)

102
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,777
BRIAN: We have this shirt.

103
00:04:47,777 --> 00:04:53,938
SAM: Oh yeah! That's Matt Mercer with white
sunglasses!

104
00:04:53,938 --> 00:04:55,353
MATT: No flesh!

105
00:04:55,353 --> 00:04:57,659
TALIESIN: An absence of Matt Mercer.

106
00:04:57,659 --> 00:05:01,621
BRIAN: The coolest Kanye West sunglasses on you've
ever seen.

107
00:05:01,621 --> 00:05:03,780
MATT: They're a little broken, but they work fine
for the image.

108
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:08,578
TALIESIN: We also have the scarves, although none
of us have the scarves on right now.

109
00:05:08,578 --> 00:05:10,523
BRIAN: You will see the scarves during the break.

110
00:05:10,523 --> 00:05:13,401
TALIESIN: And many other things.

111
00:05:13,401 --> 00:05:15,695
LIAM: Yeah, go to the shop. There's lots of shit.

112
00:05:15,695 --> 00:05:21,176
BRIAN: The d20s are in. The new Vox Machina d20s
are in the shop.

113
00:05:21,176 --> 00:05:24,773
SAM: Don't forget to watch Brian's stupid show,
every Tuesday night.

114
00:05:24,773 --> 00:05:27,393
BRIAN: Don't forget to watch Brian's stupid 
show before it gets canceled.

115
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:36,993
MARISHA: Yeah. Oh, we have a weird announcement
that came up pretty fast, as of yesterday. We are

116
00:05:36,993 --> 00:05:37,997
married.

117
00:05:37,997 --> 00:05:39,548
MATT: We did get married. That's a thing.

118
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:43,213
MARISHA: That didn't happen that fast, though.
That was very long. That was a lot, but we're

119
00:05:43,213 --> 00:05:45,942
married now.

120
00:05:45,942 --> 00:05:48,258
(Sam clinking his mug)

121
00:05:48,258 --> 00:05:50,118
MATT: No, I cannot--

122
00:05:50,118 --> 00:05:53,960
TALIESIN: That's a deep cut inside joke, right
there.

123
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,707
MARISHA: Force Grey is coming up.

124
00:05:58,707 --> 00:06:07,259
MATT: Yes, not this Saturday, but the Saturday
after that. November 18th, I think? Yes. We're

125
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:12,760
doing the Force Grey finale for season two in New
York. Tickets are available. You can go to the

126
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:17,345
official Dungeons & Dragons Twitter, or my
Twitter, for information. With fantastic guests

127
00:06:17,345 --> 00:06:23,431
like Deborah Ann Woll, Joe Manganiello, which
you've seen here on the show, Dylan and Utkarsh

128
00:06:23,431 --> 00:06:27,522
are going to be back from the series, and we have
our fifth player to announce!

129
00:06:27,522 --> 00:06:31,217
MARISHA: I'm jumping in as of yesterday! Yeah!

130
00:06:31,217 --> 00:06:33,396
BRIAN: I didn't think they had that kind of
budget!

131
00:06:33,396 --> 00:06:41,379
MARISHA: We need one more person! We're down a
player! So I am playing a tortle named Clarapin

132
00:06:41,379 --> 00:06:48,843
the therrapin. Pretty stoked. Or maybe it's
terrapin, I don't know. It's still new. I'm still

133
00:06:48,843 --> 00:06:55,140
working it out in my head. But I think we have a
picture of Clarapin. There's no vetting monitor,

134
00:06:55,140 --> 00:07:02,505
nothing, over there. Ooh! Aah! That's good old
Clarapin! She's a bard!

135
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,696
LIAM: They just ran a picture of Squirtle.

136
00:07:04,696 --> 00:07:10,666
MARISHA: Yeah, they totally could have. Teenage
Mutant Ninja-- And moving on from that, the

137
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:22,441
Critical Role podcast is up to episode 70. You can
get it on Amazon Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Plus, as

138
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:28,365
well as Alexa-enabled devices, as well as other--
I should've read the top of that, "Is now

139
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:39,191
"available through Amazon Alexa." That was the top
part of that. Vox Machina: Origins is still out.

140
00:07:39,191 --> 00:07:41,749
LIAM: We're coming up on another issue pretty
soon.

141
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:44,139
MATT: Next few weeks, issue three is going to be
out.

142
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:47,669
TALIESIN: But hey, there's a comic book. We're in
it. That's a thing.

143
00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:50,177
MARISHA: We have our big Critical Role wrap-up on
the 14th.

144
00:07:50,177 --> 00:07:56,254
BRIAN: Yes, that is going to air on the 14th,
which is a Thursday night, at 7:00, in this very

145
00:07:56,254 --> 00:08:07,211
timeslot, on these very networks. Both Twitch and
Project Alpha. We will be breaking up the Vox

146
00:08:07,211 --> 00:08:13,737
Machina journey into five sections. So we
announced on Tuesday night that the first posts

147
00:08:13,737 --> 00:08:20,083
are up if you want to submit questions for
episodes one through, I believe it's 23. In the

148
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:25,037
wrap-up episode, we're going to discuss all kinds
of stuff. We're going to let you guys ask Matt all

149
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:29,936
kinds of things. You guys are going to get to ask
each other. We're going to squeeze as many secrets

150
00:08:29,936 --> 00:08:35,073
out of this delicious man's body as we can, by any
means necessary. I have ordered many medieval

151
00:08:35,073 --> 00:08:38,794
torture devices. Gummy bears. All kinds of good
stuff.

152
00:08:38,794 --> 00:08:43,291
SAM: Oh my god, she left. Couldn't take the heat.

153
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:46,380
LIAM: Hole in the studio floor. She went down it.

154
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:54,621
BRIAN: So yeah, submit questions on the Reddit or
at the Talks Machina Twitter account, or Facebook

155
00:08:54,621 --> 00:08:56,202
page, or the Alpha forums.

156
00:08:56,202 --> 00:09:02,207
MARISHA: Correct. And then, of course, me,
Taliesin, Matt, and Liam are going to be at PAX

157
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:08,006
Unplugged next Friday. Wednesday Club, still a
thing.

158
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:11,120
TALIESIN: Still a thing. We haven't actually
decided what we're doing next week yet, because it

159
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,489
all depends on who's going to be joining us. We
have a couple invites out to people, so we're

160
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:19,038
waiting to hear. It'll be fun no matter what.

161
00:09:19,038 --> 00:09:20,492
BRIAN: When's the Moon Knight episode?

162
00:09:20,492 --> 00:09:25,298
TALIESIN: Never. Yeah, no, we'll do a Moon Knight.
You want to do a Moon Knight episode?

163
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,200
BRIAN: I would come on for a Moon Knight episode.

164
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,713
TALIESIN: I'll talk about Moon Knight. I love Moon
Knight.

165
00:09:28,713 --> 00:09:30,281
LIAM: What about Spider Ham?

166
00:09:30,281 --> 00:09:33,614
TALIESIN: Oh, Peter Porker? The Spectacular
Spider-Ham? We can do a full animals episode. That

167
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:34,849
would be a lot of fun.

168
00:09:34,849 --> 00:09:41,681
MARISHA: That would be great. You sang in a
Blizzard promo for a new expansion.

169
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:47,616
MATT: An upcoming Hearthstone expansion. Kobolds
and Catacombs, which references another cool game

170
00:09:47,616 --> 00:09:48,956
that sometimes people play.

171
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:52,295
MARISHA: Not today, though.

172
00:09:52,295 --> 00:09:56,707
MATT: No, yeah, of course. But yeah, they had me
sing the announcement trailer, which you can check

173
00:09:56,707 --> 00:10:04,364
out online and poke fun at me being a silly
voice-in-the-void minstrel bard about making your

174
00:10:04,364 --> 00:10:07,264
way through catacombs filled with kobolds. So
check it out.

175
00:10:07,264 --> 00:10:12,437
TALIESIN: Your response via text when we texted
you that that was happening was adorable. "Oh,

176
00:10:12,437 --> 00:10:14,767
"that's what that was. I suppose that's happening
now."

177
00:10:14,767 --> 00:10:17,782
MATT: Yeah, I didn't know they were announcing it
at BlizzCon. It was just like, oh, on the opening

178
00:10:17,782 --> 00:10:19,604
ceremonies screen.

179
00:10:19,604 --> 00:10:21,506
BRIAN: Were you in there when they did that?

180
00:10:21,506 --> 00:10:24,795
MATT: We were driving at the time. I was like,
"What is going--?! Oh."

181
00:10:24,795 --> 00:10:30,413
TALIESIN: Eric and I were at the Overwatch arena.
We were sitting, listening, and we both started

182
00:10:30,413 --> 00:10:32,150
squealing really loudly.

183
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:36,534
BRIAN: Yeah, that looked really fun. I saw they
brought in Darin De Paul on a big throne that they

184
00:10:36,534 --> 00:10:37,874
were all carrying.

185
00:10:37,874 --> 00:10:39,751
MARISHA: He is the mayor of BlizzCon.

186
00:10:39,751 --> 00:10:42,887
MATT: Blizzard can afford it.

187
00:10:42,887 --> 00:10:51,528
MARISHA: I think that's pretty much it. Last but
not least, I would love to thank Joana, a.k.a.

188
00:10:51,528 --> 00:10:59,551
@_sleepyjane, for doing the wonderful bear art.
And then I would like to give a huge shout-out to

189
00:10:59,551 --> 00:11:07,445
Grant Howitt, who is the writer and the producer
of Honey Heist, as well as several other silly RPG

190
00:11:07,445 --> 00:11:12,277
one-shot games. You can get this for free. That's
the amazing thing about this. He publishes all of

191
00:11:12,277 --> 00:11:19,039
his games for free. You can support him, which we
highly recommend you do, at patreon.com/gshowitt.

192
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:21,516
MATT: H-O-W-I-T-T.

193
00:11:21,516 --> 00:11:28,184
MARISHA: Yeah, and if you can join his Patreon,
you get some cool stuff that you might see. So

194
00:11:28,184 --> 00:11:33,966
yeah. Anyway. I think, oh my god.

195
00:11:33,966 --> 00:11:36,834
TALIESIN: I know, it's weird! It feels weird,
doesn't it?

196
00:11:36,834 --> 00:11:38,280
BRIAN: Say it!

197
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,233
MARISHA: What do you say? Like, "Without further
ado"?

198
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:42,459
MATT: I don't know, you've only seen it every week
for the past two and a half years!

199
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:52,150
MARISHA: Without further ado, let us now jump into
this Trinket's Honey Heist version of Critical Role!

200
00:11:52,150 --> 00:13:24,766
[dramatic music]

201
00:13:24,766 --> 00:13:26,449
MARISHA: Welcome back.

202
00:13:26,449 --> 00:13:28,154
SAM: Serious, serious.

203
00:13:28,154 --> 00:13:29,858
LIAM: We're bears.

204
00:13:29,858 --> 00:13:34,619
MARISHA: Where we last left off, didn't happen. So
we'll jump right in.

205
00:13:34,619 --> 00:13:40,331
MATT: Any rules to go over?

206
00:13:40,331 --> 00:13:42,422
MARISHA: Oh! Should I go over rules now?

207
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:43,835
MATT: I figured, that way we can go right into the
narrative.

208
00:13:43,835 --> 00:13:45,842
MARISHA: Yeah, where we last left off was rules--

209
00:13:45,842 --> 00:13:47,553
SAM: Stop backseat DMing!

210
00:13:47,553 --> 00:13:49,535
MATT: I'm trying to help! It's her first time--
I'll shut up.

211
00:13:49,535 --> 00:13:57,417
MARISHA: Before we jump in, Honey Heist is a super
simple game. Everyone is a bear. The bear has a

212
00:13:57,417 --> 00:14:04,094
special skill. We'll see that as we go along. You
will eventually be getting roles. You're trying to

213
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:15,858
heist the mother lode of honey heists. So you have
two stats: your bear stat and your criminal stat.

214
00:14:15,858 --> 00:14:21,904
You start the game with three points in each of
the stats. This is a d6-based game, so whenever

215
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:25,959
you do anything remotely bear-related, you're
going to roll your bear stat. You want to try and

216
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:33,895
get the number equal to or under how many points
you have in bear. Criminal is anything, basically,

217
00:14:33,895 --> 00:14:39,642
not related to being a bear. That's quite
literally, actually, what it says, "Not to do

218
00:14:39,642 --> 00:14:46,371
"anything directly related to being a bear." Same
thing. Equal to or under. Right? If the plan's

219
00:14:46,371 --> 00:14:52,693
going well, I can reward you with a point in
criminal. You move a point from bear over to the

220
00:14:52,693 --> 00:14:59,485
stat. Conversely, if you start getting a little
aggravated, or the plan starts not working out in

221
00:14:59,485 --> 00:15:05,185
your favor, you might move a point from criminal
into bear, the more frustrated you get. If you

222
00:15:05,185 --> 00:15:11,483
reach six points in either stat, you either turn
into an insane criminal mastermind, betray the

223
00:15:11,483 --> 00:15:18,413
party, and decide to bounce, or you go completely
feral as a bear and can't really function being a

224
00:15:18,413 --> 00:15:22,402
criminal anymore, and you're out. So you don't
want that to happen.

225
00:15:22,402 --> 00:15:27,814
SAM: Is there any other way to die? Like, if you
fall off something, do you die? What happens?

226
00:15:27,814 --> 00:15:31,217
MARISHA: Just don't jump off any cliffs is my
recommendation.

227
00:15:31,217 --> 00:15:35,430
MATT: You get more frustrated from jumping off
a cliff. You become more bear-like. Cliffs can't

228
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,381
kill bears.

229
00:15:36,381 --> 00:15:41,802
MARISHA: No. It's very cartoonish. Cartoon
physics. Just don't look down if you decide to

230
00:15:41,802 --> 00:15:43,220
walk off a cliff.

231
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,659
BRIAN: Do forest fires kill bears?

232
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:49,327
MATT: No, they don't. That's why he has to keep
telling us to fight them.

233
00:15:49,327 --> 00:15:57,163
MARISHA: If you feel like you're starting to get a
little too bear-y, you can flash back to a

234
00:15:57,163 --> 00:16:03,605
criminal planning sequence in order to move a
point from bear into criminal. If you're feeling a

235
00:16:03,605 --> 00:16:12,256
little too shady, you can eat a nice little snack
of honey to move a point from criminal back into bear.

236
00:16:12,256 --> 00:16:15,259
LIAM: Do we have a Batman belt with honey stashed
on it?

237
00:16:15,259 --> 00:16:16,371
MATT: Nope.

238
00:16:16,371 --> 00:16:18,585
LIAM: We have to find it and eat it? Yeah.

239
00:16:18,585 --> 00:16:24,657
MARISHA: That's what you guys are good at. All
right, I think we get started.

240
00:16:24,657 --> 00:16:31,185
SAM: (bear roar) Ease into it.

241
00:16:31,185 --> 00:16:36,390
MARISHA: No wookiees. Hereby ban on wookiees.

242
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,148
BRIAN: Oh, I should go.

243
00:16:38,148 --> 00:16:40,815
MATT: Well no, it's my plan to die in the first
half of the show.

244
00:16:40,815 --> 00:16:52,921
MARISHA: This isn't the zombie apocalypse. All
right. It's autumn, two years after the defeat of

245
00:16:52,921 --> 00:16:55,281
the Chroma Conclave, in Westruun.

246
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:56,606
SAM: Wait, we're in Westruun?

247
00:16:56,606 --> 00:16:58,164
MARISHA: We're in Westruun.

248
00:16:58,164 --> 00:16:59,575
LIAM: Those fucking assholes.

249
00:16:59,575 --> 00:17:05,165
MARISHA: The air has that perfect, crisp breeze
indicative of the chillier months to come. The

250
00:17:05,165 --> 00:17:11,937
scent of deep-fried festival foods and fermented
alcohols radiates heavily from the center of the

251
00:17:11,937 --> 00:17:17,842
town square in the Opal and Market Wards. The
distant sound of string quartets and laughing

252
00:17:17,842 --> 00:17:27,455
townsfolk pick up in your ear. Trinket, the
immense sense recall spawns the memory in your

253
00:17:27,455 --> 00:17:39,627
head, and you know: this is the Happy Food
Festival time. This is your favorite time. But for

254
00:17:39,627 --> 00:17:47,788
some reason, Vex is walking you away from the
festival, and toward the Bramblewood Forest! "I

255
00:17:47,788 --> 00:17:55,528
"know, buddy, but listen, I need you to stay here.
Look, I can't have you risking sneaking away and

256
00:17:55,528 --> 00:17:57,257
"giving in to your temptations again."

257
00:17:57,257 --> 00:17:59,374
MATT: (sad bear growl)

258
00:17:59,374 --> 00:18:03,595
MARISHA: "Pike would kill me, and she's already
upset at you for clearing out the Slayer's Cake

259
00:18:03,595 --> 00:18:14,652
"honey stash the past two times. I know. But look,
I promise you, if you do this for me, buddy, I'll

260
00:18:14,652 --> 00:18:24,120
"come back with a whole load of festival treats!
All right? All right, darling? Okay. Be good.

261
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:33,101
"Don't get into any trouble. Okay? Happy bear." And
she walks on down the road.

262
00:18:33,101 --> 00:18:34,900
MATT: Where am I at, right now?

263
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:41,183
MARISHA: You are currently on the edge of the
Bramblewood Forest, up on a mountain. You can kind

264
00:18:41,183 --> 00:18:43,079
of see Westruun in the distance.

265
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:45,840
MATT: So looking down at the city from a distance?
Okay.

266
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:52,269
MARISHA: You can see far off that the city is
dressed up in autumn colors and reds, and there

267
00:18:52,269 --> 00:19:00,143
are wagons being pulled into the city. You
recalled Vex mentioning something about the

268
00:19:00,143 --> 00:19:06,866
Slayer's Cake competing in a competition. Seems
like they've got a lot of competitions. They are

269
00:19:06,866 --> 00:19:17,195
entering Keyleth and Pike's prize honey. Mm-hmm.
So you know there's a lot of honey. As you turn

270
00:19:17,195 --> 00:19:26,013
around, you hear a few cracks of branches. There's
a crowd of other bears. Seem to have been watching

271
00:19:26,013 --> 00:19:31,898
the whole time. There's a panda that waves.

272
00:19:31,898 --> 00:19:34,712
SAM: Can we speak English?

273
00:19:34,712 --> 00:19:43,729
MARISHA: Yeah, you can speak to each other. You
can kind of mumble through words to humans. Yeah,

274
00:19:43,729 --> 00:19:46,814
you can, kind of.

275
00:19:46,814 --> 00:19:49,095
MATT: Hey, you.

276
00:19:49,095 --> 00:19:50,534
SAM: Yeah?

277
00:19:50,534 --> 00:19:52,105
MATT: What's your name?

278
00:19:52,105 --> 00:19:59,721
SAM: Oh, me? I'm Peddy Tuxpin. I'm new to these
parts. I come from, you know, somewhere else. But

279
00:19:59,721 --> 00:20:04,263
I've been walking around. Checking it out. I like the
place.

280
00:20:04,263 --> 00:20:06,345
MATT: All right, you seem a little fish out of
water.

281
00:20:06,345 --> 00:20:07,917
SAM: What's your name?

282
00:20:07,917 --> 00:20:10,604
MATT: They call me Trinket.

283
00:20:10,604 --> 00:20:12,069
SAM: You a girl?

284
00:20:12,069 --> 00:20:19,940
MATT: I am a member of Vox Machina, saviors of
this land, Tal'Dorei, and beyond. You show me some

285
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,220
respect.

286
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:25,479
SAM: I look at his junk. Hey, he's not a girl.

287
00:20:25,479 --> 00:20:30,758
MATT: Who are you untrustworthy lot, too, to be
with this guy?

288
00:20:30,811 --> 00:20:40,323
LIAM: Hey, my name is Cookie. I am a bear. This is
my brother, Waffle.

289
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:47,904
TALIESIN: How you doing? Yeah, we just rolled into
town, picked up this guy along the way. We don't

290
00:20:47,904 --> 00:20:53,966
speak for him, not going to give him any credit
right now. Seems like an okay guy.

291
00:20:53,966 --> 00:20:57,150
MATT: You guys are all hanging out here at the
edge of the Bramblewood for no reason?

292
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,932
LIAM: Well, man, we heard this town's got the good
shit.

293
00:20:58,932 --> 00:21:12,578
MATT: You may have heard right. All right. Three
new bears. Three large-sized, normal bears.

294
00:21:12,578 --> 00:21:15,280
SAM: There's another guy. There's one more guy.

295
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,224
MATT: I look around, and I only see the three
bears.

296
00:21:18,224 --> 00:21:19,982
SAM: There's one more.

297
00:21:19,982 --> 00:21:22,021
BRIAN: I'm a little smaller.

298
00:21:22,021 --> 00:21:25,209
MARISHA: He peeks out from behind Peddy Tuxpin.

299
00:21:25,209 --> 00:21:36,507
BRIAN: I'm not really a bear. I'm a honey badger.
My name is Liam Las Vegas. I'm on a bender. That's it.

300
00:21:36,507 --> 00:21:38,433
SAM: A honey bender?

301
00:21:38,433 --> 00:21:44,950
BRIAN: I'm on a honey bender. I'm here with you
lads, strictly for the honey.

302
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:51,234
TALIESIN: Don't let his personality defects fool
you. He's a top man, knows his business.

303
00:21:51,234 --> 00:21:54,050
LIAM: I mean, he's a total asshole, but he's
really good at his work.

304
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:56,187
TALIESIN: He's good at what he does, when he can
do it.

305
00:21:56,187 --> 00:21:59,024
BRIAN: Started out as a bottom man, now I'm a top
man.

306
00:21:59,024 --> 00:22:01,394
TALIESIN: Worked his way to the middle, mostly.

307
00:22:01,394 --> 00:22:02,958
BRIAN: Middle man.

308
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:05,784
TALIESIN: Top of his field, as a middle man.

309
00:22:05,784 --> 00:22:07,462
BRIAN: Top of the middle.

310
00:22:07,462 --> 00:22:09,228
TALIESIN: Worked his way from the bottom.

311
00:22:09,228 --> 00:22:11,248
BRIAN: Started from the bottom, now we at the
middle man.

312
00:22:11,248 --> 00:22:13,105
TALIESIN: Top of it.

313
00:22:13,105 --> 00:22:21,136
MARISHA: As you hear the music in the background
press on, all you can keep thinking about,

314
00:22:21,136 --> 00:22:30,265
Trinket, is that massive stash of honey hiding
right behind the walls of the Hazel Festival.

315
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:33,184
MATT: I look out. Do I still see Vex, or is she
far enough away?

316
00:22:33,184 --> 00:22:36,301
MARISHA: She's pretty far gone, at this point,
over the mountain. She doesn't seem to be paying

317
00:22:36,301 --> 00:22:37,697
any attention to you.

318
00:22:37,697 --> 00:22:39,676
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and sense honey.

319
00:22:39,676 --> 00:22:42,901
MARISHA: Okay, roll a bear.

320
00:22:42,901 --> 00:22:45,309
TALIESIN: Double die.

321
00:22:45,309 --> 00:22:46,711
MARISHA: You get advantage, yeah.

322
00:22:46,711 --> 00:22:51,421
TALIESIN: Nope. Wait, is this--? Nope.

323
00:22:51,421 --> 00:23:01,006
MARISHA: All right, right now, there's a lot of
fried foods. You know at ren faire, when that mead

324
00:23:01,006 --> 00:23:06,394
smell and dirt? Kind of like that. That's all
you've got right now. It's a little too much right now.

325
00:23:06,394 --> 00:23:09,850
LIAM: We probably want to get closer in before we
start using the, you know.

326
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:13,282
TALIESIN: No no, the nose ain't picking nothing up
right now. No.

327
00:23:13,282 --> 00:23:15,432
MARISHA: You begin to make your plan.

328
00:23:15,432 --> 00:23:18,390
BRIAN: We should obviously get drinks.

329
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:26,275
MATT: I was going to say, first and foremost, like
I said, my name's Trinket. I'm an adventurer. I've

330
00:23:26,275 --> 00:23:31,115
been through dungeons of all sorts and kinds. Used
to scaring things off that are dangerous, in my

331
00:23:31,115 --> 00:23:37,312
way. I have no idea what the hell you're all
capable of. You, panda bear.

332
00:23:37,312 --> 00:23:39,077
SAM: The name's Peddy.

333
00:23:39,077 --> 00:23:40,407
MATT: Peddy.

334
00:23:40,407 --> 00:23:42,043
SAM: Peddy Bear.

335
00:23:42,043 --> 00:23:47,706
(muffled laughter)

336
00:23:47,706 --> 00:23:52,894
MATT: Tell me. If we're going to go into this city
and we're going to reap the rewards of this honey

337
00:23:52,894 --> 00:23:58,554
festival contest, and I know where it is, what do
you have to bring to the table, anyway?

338
00:23:58,554 --> 00:24:04,043
MARISHA: Peddy, why don't you go ahead and roll a
d6? This will determine your role.

339
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:06,508
SAM: One.

340
00:24:06,508 --> 00:24:11,863
MARISHA: Peddy. Peddy Tuxpin, you're the muscle of
the group.

341
00:24:11,863 --> 00:24:24,371
SAM: Let me lay out a day in the life of Peddy
Tuxpin for you. I wake up. I eat. Bamboo, mostly.

342
00:24:24,371 --> 00:24:30,590
About 10:00am, I eat. 12:00, I eat.

343
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,518
BRIAN: What do you eat at 12:00?

344
00:24:32,518 --> 00:24:43,991
SAM: Bamboo. 1:00 through 4:00 is naptime. 4:00 to
bedtime is eating. Now, I lay this all out for you

345
00:24:43,991 --> 00:24:52,802
because I want you to know, what I do with those
calories is I crush skulls. I break bones. I rough

346
00:24:52,802 --> 00:25:00,236
up people who haven't made their payments. I,
well, we can arm wrestle if you really want a

347
00:25:00,236 --> 00:25:04,896
sense of what this Tuxpin's all about.

348
00:25:04,896 --> 00:25:07,361
LIAM: Peddy, don't hurt him.

349
00:25:07,361 --> 00:25:11,811
BRIAN: He seems quite serious.

350
00:25:11,811 --> 00:25:16,140
MATT: As a fellow bear who has immediately stared
at my junk, I feel it is only right and fair that

351
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,780
I accept your challenge.

352
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,603
SAM: Oh, we're going to do this! Paws up!

353
00:25:19,603 --> 00:25:22,050
MATT: (collision sounds)

354
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:29,526
MARISHA: I'd say, roll a bear-off. You get
advantage, Peddy.

355
00:25:29,526 --> 00:25:31,571
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Paw-wrestling.

356
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:35,865
SAM: Oh, okay, a one is my better stat.

357
00:25:35,865 --> 00:25:38,576
MATT: No, I don't. I have a four.

358
00:25:38,576 --> 00:25:44,608
MARISHA: Without fail, Peddy, like a sprig of
bamboo, snaps all the way back.

359
00:25:44,608 --> 00:25:46,558
SAM: Oh shit! You okay?

360
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:50,207
MATT: All right, we need some muscle. You've
proven yourself worthy. Do I move a point for

361
00:25:50,207 --> 00:25:52,104
failing the roll?

362
00:25:52,104 --> 00:25:55,737
MARISHA: Do you feel aggravated? You agreed to it.
You're fine. Not yet.

363
00:25:55,737 --> 00:25:59,683
TALIESIN: Pandas, they're fighters, not lovers.

364
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:04,529
MATT: So, we got muscle. What do you two brothers
got at the table?

365
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:05,917
MARISHA: Roll d6s.

366
00:26:05,917 --> 00:26:09,323
TALIESIN: One.

367
00:26:09,323 --> 00:26:13,069
MARISHA: Do you want to still also be a muscle, or
would you like to re-roll?

368
00:26:13,069 --> 00:26:14,893
TALIESIN: No, let's roll that. Four.

369
00:26:14,893 --> 00:26:19,593
MARISHA: All right. Cookie, you're the brains of
the group.

370
00:26:19,593 --> 00:26:21,245
LIAM: Of course I am.

371
00:26:21,245 --> 00:26:25,218
MARISHA: Waffle, you're the hacker.

372
00:26:25,218 --> 00:26:29,154
(laughter)

373
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:31,124
LIAM: A hacker bear!

374
00:26:31,124 --> 00:26:33,169
SAM: What do we need a hacker for?!

375
00:26:33,169 --> 00:26:35,321
MATT: Do we write our roles down on our sheet?

376
00:26:35,321 --> 00:26:37,783
MARISHA: Yes, write your roles down.

377
00:26:37,783 --> 00:26:42,934
LIAM: Let me tell you, we've hit all the biggest
places. We've hit Vasselheim. We have hit Stilben,

378
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:50,532
okay. We've been to the Briarwoods' home turf, and
we got all their fucking honey. We're going to get

379
00:26:50,532 --> 00:26:54,727
this honey because this fucking guy is going to
hack the system.

380
00:26:54,727 --> 00:26:58,505
TALIESIN: I can hack anything. Anything you need.
I can hack doors! I can hack people! I can hack

381
00:26:58,505 --> 00:27:00,476
cities, hack right through them.

382
00:27:00,476 --> 00:27:03,729
BRIAN: Even with those stubby fingers?

383
00:27:03,729 --> 00:27:07,949
TALIESIN: Hey man, you know how to hack? Then
don't be talking to me about my business.

384
00:27:07,949 --> 00:27:11,648
MARISHA: What do you know how to do, Liam Las
Vegas?

385
00:27:11,648 --> 00:27:13,592
TALIESIN: What exactly do you do, honey badger?

386
00:27:13,592 --> 00:27:14,792
BRIAN: Two.

387
00:27:14,792 --> 00:27:15,946
SAM: Re-roll.

388
00:27:15,946 --> 00:27:24,793
BRIAN: No. No. No. Yeah! Three.

389
00:27:24,793 --> 00:27:27,427
MARISHA: You're the driver.

390
00:27:27,427 --> 00:27:32,332
BRIAN: Yeah! Yeah, all right! I'll be the driver.

391
00:27:32,332 --> 00:27:35,316
SAM: What's your deal?

392
00:27:35,316 --> 00:27:37,874
BRIAN: I'm the driver!

393
00:27:37,874 --> 00:27:41,658
LIAM: Where's our ride at? What are we taking this
time?

394
00:27:41,658 --> 00:27:45,876
BRIAN: Well, we've got a horse and buggy.

395
00:27:45,876 --> 00:27:48,138
MARISHA: You're going to have to pick up a ride.

396
00:27:48,138 --> 00:27:55,337
BRIAN: We're going to pick up a ride. Don't worry,
I have super high criminal-risma.

397
00:27:55,337 --> 00:28:03,402
MARISHA: All right, Trinket, you're the last one.

398
00:28:03,402 --> 00:28:08,733
MATT: So it looks like we got a nice selection of
abilities, here. So let me tell you what I have to

399
00:28:08,733 --> 00:28:15,312
offer. One, I know where the honey is. Two, I know
the people probably around it. Three--

400
00:28:15,312 --> 00:28:19,218
MARISHA: It's anything-- A five? You're a thief.

401
00:28:19,218 --> 00:28:20,860
SAM: Well, that makes sense.

402
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:23,546
BRIAN: Just like your mom!

403
00:28:23,546 --> 00:28:29,928
MATT: Let me tell you. I've learned a few tricks
from the two that raised me, so that honey's going

404
00:28:29,928 --> 00:28:31,722
to be as good as ours.

405
00:28:31,722 --> 00:28:42,191
SAM: I feel like now would be a good time for me
to confess that I don't really like, I've never

406
00:28:42,191 --> 00:28:45,199
had honey. I eat bamboo, mostly.

407
00:28:45,199 --> 00:28:46,731
BRIAN: Is it a gluten thing?

408
00:28:46,731 --> 00:28:51,939
SAM: No no, I just haven't had it. Just don't have
it much where I come from.

409
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:55,202
LIAM: You take the bamboo and you stir it around
in the honey. You have them together.

410
00:28:55,202 --> 00:28:58,045
SAM: That would be good? Okay.

411
00:28:58,045 --> 00:29:00,988
LIAM: It's like celery and peanut butter. Don't
knock it.

412
00:29:00,988 --> 00:29:07,451
BRIAN: Did you bring any bamboo with you, in a
sack or something?

413
00:29:07,451 --> 00:29:08,765
SAM: Did I?

414
00:29:08,765 --> 00:29:12,381
MARISHA: Did you bring any bamboo? Mm, nah.

415
00:29:12,381 --> 00:29:16,175
SAM: I ate it on the way here. I eat a lot.

416
00:29:16,175 --> 00:29:22,797
MARISHA: You also like to eat anything that kind
of remotely resembles bamboo.

417
00:29:22,797 --> 00:29:27,279
TALIESIN: He's going to get hangry. You're not
going to like him when he's hangry.

418
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:33,080
LIAM: All right. Our newfound friend, Trinket.
What can you tell us about this town? Where the

419
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,901
honey is? What are we working with, here, buddy?

420
00:29:35,901 --> 00:29:39,795
MATT: All them banners you see out there beyond
the walls? This is a goddamned celebration.

421
00:29:39,795 --> 00:29:46,767
There's a contest in there. My ears picked it up.
In the middle of that contest area, I can smell

422
00:29:46,767 --> 00:29:53,032
it, there's all the honey we could ever hope for.
Possibly even some bamboo. Keep your eyes open.

423
00:29:53,032 --> 00:29:59,608
Now all we have to do is get inside, so, if you're
the brains, what do you suggest?

424
00:29:59,608 --> 00:30:05,316
LIAM: We need some kind of distraction. We're
going to dress as people. That's the plan.

425
00:30:05,316 --> 00:30:10,933
SAM: Dress as people? How's that going to work? We
all look giant.

426
00:30:10,933 --> 00:30:17,033
MARISHA: Trinket, your ears pick up in the
distance: "Hats! Get your hats!"

427
00:30:17,033 --> 00:30:27,135
MATT: I'm going to immediately go: I think you're
onto something! Cookie, Waffle, Liam Las Vegas,

428
00:30:27,135 --> 00:30:31,475
Peddy Bear, let's go get us some hats.

429
00:30:31,475 --> 00:30:39,193
MARISHA: He's about a hundred yards away, entering
into the south entrance of the city, about to

430
00:30:39,193 --> 00:30:41,285
cross the threshold.

431
00:30:41,285 --> 00:30:46,784
MATT: Okay. Do we want to try and quickly and
quietly make our way up behind?

432
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:49,805
SAM: Well, what do we see?

433
00:30:49,805 --> 00:30:55,747
BRIAN: I would technically be the smallest,
correct? Being a honey badger rather than a bear?

434
00:30:55,747 --> 00:31:03,277
I could maybe, if I need to slip by unnoticed, to
grab a couple of things and bring them back to you guys?

435
00:31:03,277 --> 00:31:08,681
LIAM: That's right, here's what we're going to do,
okay? Cookie and Waffle, we're going to fuck shit up,

436
00:31:08,681 --> 00:31:13,067
all right? We're going to get in the garbage,
we're going to start fucking with people's shit. I

437
00:31:13,067 --> 00:31:17,856
might even scare a little kid. When that
happens, you're in. You grab as many fucking hats

438
00:31:17,856 --> 00:31:21,392
as you can, and you skedaddle back. We meet up
together and then we choose which hats we're going

439
00:31:21,392 --> 00:31:25,192
to wear, and which makes us look most human, or
elf, or halfling in your case.

440
00:31:25,192 --> 00:31:31,504
BRIAN: Okay, but one question. Let me know any
size preferences or style before. I don't want to

441
00:31:31,504 --> 00:31:34,935
come back and then have a big argument, and then I
got to go back again.

442
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:37,055
MATT: Mr. Las Vegas, surprise us.

443
00:31:37,055 --> 00:31:39,819
BRIAN: All right. I can do it.

444
00:31:39,819 --> 00:31:42,107
MARISHA: All right, Liam, you--

445
00:31:42,107 --> 00:31:43,565
LIAM: Oh, shit. Sorry.

446
00:31:43,565 --> 00:31:44,947
MARISHA: Las Vegas.

447
00:31:44,947 --> 00:31:46,593
MATT: We'll call you Vegas. You're Vegas.

448
00:31:46,593 --> 00:31:49,482
MARISHA: Goddamn you.

449
00:31:49,482 --> 00:31:51,491
BRIAN: Vegas strong, baby.

450
00:31:51,491 --> 00:31:58,448
MARISHA: Vegas, you skitter on down past, using
the rocks and the fauna to dodge as you get up

451
00:31:58,448 --> 00:32:04,335
close behind the guy. Cookie and Waffle, were you
guys--?

452
00:32:04,335 --> 00:32:08,752
TALIESIN: I say we split up. You take the bottom
of the road, I take the top.

453
00:32:08,752 --> 00:32:12,198
LIAM: Okay, what I'm going to do is I'm going to
scare a bunch of little children. I want you to

454
00:32:12,198 --> 00:32:15,252
start tearing down the festive decorations that
you see.

455
00:32:15,252 --> 00:32:16,743
TALIESIN: You want me to hack those decorations?

456
00:32:16,743 --> 00:32:20,121
LIAM: Hack the decorations the fuck off the walls
and make a lot of noise, Waffle.

457
00:32:20,121 --> 00:32:21,779
TALIESIN: All right, it's going to be a loud hack.

458
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:27,378
SAM: Boss, you need me to do anything?

459
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:29,847
TALIESIN: If anyone tries to stop us--

460
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:32,611
LIAM: You got a suggestion, Trinket?

461
00:32:32,611 --> 00:32:36,640
MATT: I'm just going to say, be careful about too
much mayhem. We don't want people to suspect

462
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,794
there's bears running wild around the city. They
might shut down the festival. Then the honey is--

463
00:32:40,794 --> 00:32:44,559
So if you're going to do a scare, do it and get
out.

464
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:51,801
MARISHA: All right. Waffle and Cookie? Flank from
the sides. As you start getting up to the wall of

465
00:32:51,801 --> 00:32:57,316
the city, you see two guards standing at the
entrance, nodding and greeting people, letting

466
00:32:57,316 --> 00:33:04,068
them go in as they go. You see a few banners hung
up along the wall. Few flowers.

467
00:33:04,068 --> 00:33:09,918
TALIESIN: I'm going to hack a couple banners down.
We have a brief disguise. Going to hack a couple

468
00:33:09,918 --> 00:33:10,775
banners.

469
00:33:10,775 --> 00:33:13,716
LIAM: You said there's a couple of soldiers,
guards?

470
00:33:13,716 --> 00:33:15,507
MARISHA: Couple of guards, yeah. Couple of
shields.

471
00:33:15,507 --> 00:33:17,150
LIAM: Are there any kids in sight?

472
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:23,926
MARISHA: There's maybe one or two coming in,
families coming in and filtering into the city for

473
00:33:23,926 --> 00:33:25,939
the festival. Most people seem to be inside.

474
00:33:25,939 --> 00:33:28,241
LIAM: Between me and them? Or are the kids open
season, you know what I'm saying?

475
00:33:28,241 --> 00:33:33,126
MARISHA: Kids are currently open season, yeah. You
see a mom and dad, two kids, typical looking

476
00:33:33,126 --> 00:33:40,575
family out for a nice day. You see another kid
going along in with one of the vendors. They've

477
00:33:40,575 --> 00:33:42,396
got some vegetables on their back.

478
00:33:42,396 --> 00:33:45,768
TALIESIN: We wrap ourselves in these banners that
I've pulled down. Then they won't know that we're

479
00:33:45,768 --> 00:33:47,695
bears. We'll just be giant flying banners.

480
00:33:47,695 --> 00:33:49,002
LIAM: They might think we're ghosts.

481
00:33:49,002 --> 00:33:51,452
TALIESIN: They might be ghosts, and then they'll
be prepared for ghosts. They'll never see us

482
00:33:51,452 --> 00:33:52,363
coming.

483
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,444
LIAM: Yeah. They'll try to turn us and it won't
work.

484
00:33:54,444 --> 00:33:56,060
TALIESIN: Nope, ain't going to do a thing.

485
00:33:56,060 --> 00:34:00,920
MARISHA: Liam Las Vegas, as this is happening, you
get up right behind. You follow in. You're about

486
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:12,072
maybe five feet out from the back of Theobald the
Bold, the best hat vendor in town. Theobald the

487
00:34:12,072 --> 00:34:19,226
Bold, is because his hat's the boldest. He's a
little halfling dude with scrappy clothes, but

488
00:34:19,226 --> 00:34:24,589
his hat looks way overpriced in comparison to
everything else. He's hunched, he's got a

489
00:34:24,589 --> 00:34:26,779
pull-behind wagon piled with hats.

490
00:34:26,779 --> 00:34:30,773
TALIESIN: Really leaning into it, isn't he?

491
00:34:30,773 --> 00:34:33,327
MARISHA: "Get your hats! Festival hats!"

492
00:34:33,327 --> 00:34:35,184
SAM: Go, Las Vegas! Go!

493
00:34:35,184 --> 00:34:39,570
TALIESIN: I'm going to hack the banners.

494
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:43,225
MARISHA: All right, as this is happening, you
start hacking the banner. Roll for criminal.

495
00:34:43,225 --> 00:34:45,694
That's a double if you're a hacker.

496
00:34:45,694 --> 00:34:48,527
TALIESIN: Yeah! Two.

497
00:34:48,527 --> 00:34:56,815
MARISHA: All right, you're a little tangled in
them. The pendants are getting in your face a

498
00:34:56,815 --> 00:34:59,356
little bit. What are you doing, Cookie?

499
00:34:59,356 --> 00:35:04,289
LIAM: While I get covered up, I'm going to start
running towards the kids and yell as loud as I can

500
00:35:04,289 --> 00:35:06,333
like this (intimidating scream).

501
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:07,741
MARISHA: The kids (terrified screaming).

502
00:35:07,741 --> 00:35:11,266
LIAM: I'm going to take a shit and then I'm going
to slap it at the grownups' heads that are with

503
00:35:11,266 --> 00:35:16,762
the kids. (screams)

504
00:35:16,762 --> 00:35:25,290
MARISHA: About this time, the dad goes, "Guards!
Bears! Get help!" About this time, one of the

505
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:31,464
guards looks over at the other one and goes, "Aw
Glennon, we have a bear attack!" They start running

506
00:35:31,464 --> 00:35:36,044
after you, banging their shields against the
spears going, (yelling) "Get away!"

507
00:35:36,044 --> 00:35:37,874
LIAM: I start flinging shit at them!

508
00:35:37,874 --> 00:35:44,074
MARISHA: "Aw, they're those shit-flinging bears,
Glennon!" (yelling) they're trying to block it.

509
00:35:44,074 --> 00:35:45,557
Roll for criminal.

510
00:35:45,557 --> 00:35:47,259
LIAM: Criminal is for flinging shit?

511
00:35:47,259 --> 00:35:52,028
MARISHA: Roll for bear. I guess you are being more
of a bear than the brains right now.

512
00:35:52,085 --> 00:35:58,429
LIAM: This is the smartest idea that any bear has
ever had. It's a two!

513
00:35:58,429 --> 00:36:07,520
MARISHA: You successfully fling shit. As the
guards try to duck and cover, one gets hit right

514
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:13,370
in the right eye and he's like, "Aw!" And they
start jabbing at you guys with spears.

515
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:14,413
LIAM: We're out!

516
00:36:14,413 --> 00:36:16,402
TALIESIN: Let's take them out. We're leading them
away from the hats.

517
00:36:16,402 --> 00:36:23,054
MARISHA: They chase you off, probably a good 50 or
so yards off around the corner.

518
00:36:23,054 --> 00:36:24,795
TALIESIN: We'll go into the woods, where you're
supposed to poop.

519
00:36:24,795 --> 00:36:26,809
LIAM: Right. As we're running, I yell: Hack the
system!

520
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:33,610
MARISHA: "I think those bears were rabid. Pretty
sure, but we probably should have put them down."

521
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:40,190
They slowly walk back. In this time-- how many
hats?

522
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:44,118
BRIAN: How many do you think I could carry? Ten?

523
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:51,482
MARISHA: You could probably do a few darts and
hide a few in this time. Roll for criminal.

524
00:36:51,482 --> 00:36:58,887
BRIAN: Okay. Four. No good.

525
00:36:58,887 --> 00:37:03,007
MARISHA: About this time, in the distraction--

526
00:37:03,007 --> 00:37:04,655
BRIAN: Have I gotten any away yet?

527
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:09,380
MARISHA: Yeah, you got a nice, solid haul. As
you're trying to go for your bonus hats, Theobald

528
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:15,221
turns around and goes, "Rats! There's bears and
rats! Get out!"

529
00:37:15,221 --> 00:37:16,738
BRIAN: I'm not a rat, you piece of shit!

530
00:37:16,738 --> 00:37:23,481
MARISHA: He stomps at you. "Aw, look, he knocked
over my hats." Starts scooping up the ones.

531
00:37:23,481 --> 00:37:25,017
BRIAN: I have claws, right?

532
00:37:25,017 --> 00:37:26,535
MARISHA: Little bit.

533
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:29,330
BRIAN: Just want to get him in the butt.

534
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,865
SAM: Oh right, attack?

535
00:37:30,865 --> 00:37:32,058
MARISHA: Oh, you're attacking?

536
00:37:32,058 --> 00:37:33,414
BRIAN: Just going to (boing).

537
00:37:33,414 --> 00:37:39,415
MARISHA: Roll 2d6 and roll for the lowest under
bear. You have carnage.

538
00:37:39,415 --> 00:37:40,956
LIAM: Are you going to poke him in the gooch?

539
00:37:40,956 --> 00:37:43,602
MATT: A one and a two!

540
00:37:43,602 --> 00:37:52,297
MARISHA: Okay! Theobald goes (yelps) and takes off
running. A few more fall off and you take the

541
00:37:52,297 --> 00:37:58,337
extra hats.You guys all slowly get back. You
reconvene. That actually went off pretty well,

542
00:37:58,337 --> 00:38:05,120
considering, so you guys each put a point into
criminal. Waffle, Cookie, and Liam Las Vegas.

543
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,003
LIAM: Do we take it away from bear when we put it
into criminal?

544
00:38:07,003 --> 00:38:09,519
MARISHA: Take one away from bear, put it into
criminal.

545
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:15,543
MATT: As they're approaching him, I'm talking to
Peddy. There's not a whole lot of space in the

546
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:19,833
necklace, it's pretty cramped. At least I have a
pretty good view; it's like a tiny television.

547
00:38:19,833 --> 00:38:23,587
They're here! All right. How'd it go?

548
00:38:23,587 --> 00:38:26,414
LIAM and BRIAN: We got hats!

549
00:38:26,414 --> 00:38:28,325
MATT: You got hats and you smell like shit.

550
00:38:28,325 --> 00:38:36,445
BRIAN: Does a bear shit on the Pope? I got hats of
every kind you want. We got big ones, I don't know

551
00:38:36,445 --> 00:38:37,351
what I got.

552
00:38:37,351 --> 00:38:40,050
MARISHA: Everyone roll a d8! A d8 please!

553
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:45,807
BRIAN: I need to borrow one. Oh wait, I have
Marisha's Wyrmwood.

554
00:38:45,807 --> 00:38:49,842
TALIESIN and BRIAN: Six.

555
00:38:49,842 --> 00:38:52,233
SAM: Oh, we got three sixes.

556
00:38:52,233 --> 00:38:55,881
MARISHA: Three sixes. You two sixes reroll because
this is the one hat that I only have one of.

557
00:38:55,881 --> 00:38:56,747
BRIAN: Five.

558
00:38:56,747 --> 00:38:57,770
TALIESIN: Eight.

559
00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:58,867
LIAM: Two.

560
00:38:58,867 --> 00:39:01,333
MARISHA: You roll twice, you get two hats!

561
00:39:01,333 --> 00:39:06,003
MARISHA: Peddy, this fez looks real attractive to
you.

562
00:39:06,003 --> 00:39:07,719
TALIESIN: There's a second fez!

563
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:09,341
LIAM: That's the best one!

564
00:39:09,341 --> 00:39:12,028
TALIESIN: It's inside the other hats. It's in one
of the top hats.

565
00:39:12,028 --> 00:39:14,812
MATT: Taliesin, do you want a fez and another hat
then?

566
00:39:14,812 --> 00:39:21,084
MARISHA: You'll get a fez and one more hat, so
roll again. What did you roll, five? Two.

567
00:39:21,084 --> 00:39:24,410
TALIESIN: I rolled an eight again. It's me! I'm
just going to roll the highest possible over and

568
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:25,710
over again.

569
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:28,259
MARISHA: What color top hat would you like?

570
00:39:28,259 --> 00:39:29,909
LIAM: Oh my god, what are my options?

571
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:33,717
MARISHA: Black, green, and a leathery tan.

572
00:39:33,717 --> 00:39:35,791
LIAM: Holy shit, I'll take leathery tan.

573
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:38,560
TALIESIN: There's a gray one, too.

574
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,360
LIAM: Oh my god!

575
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,758
MATT: That's a Willy Wonka hat!

576
00:39:42,758 --> 00:39:48,585
LIAM: Holy fuckballs, I am a happy bear. Woohoo!

577
00:39:48,585 --> 00:39:54,994
MARISHA: Trinket, you get a trilby. What did you
roll again, Liam Las Vegas?

578
00:39:54,994 --> 00:39:56,218
BRIAN: Five.

579
00:39:56,218 --> 00:39:58,060
LIAM: That is so confusing.

580
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,525
BRIAN: I did it just to fuck with you.

581
00:40:00,525 --> 00:40:03,261
MARISHA: Which cowboy hat do you want?

582
00:40:03,261 --> 00:40:06,609
BRIAN: Holy fucking shit, you give me that one in
your left hand right this moment.

583
00:40:06,609 --> 00:40:09,921
TALIESIN: I get a second hat?

584
00:40:09,921 --> 00:40:11,030
MARISHA: You get a second hat.

585
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,634
TALIESIN: I rolled an eight again. So now I rolled
a six.

586
00:40:12,634 --> 00:40:15,942
MARISHA: Roll again because a six is still a fez.

587
00:40:15,942 --> 00:40:17,224
TALIESIN: I rolled an eight again.

588
00:40:17,224 --> 00:40:18,442
MARISHA: Roll again.

589
00:40:18,442 --> 00:40:19,583
TALIESIN: I rolled a three.

590
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,614
MATT: So you can put three hats on?!

591
00:40:21,614 --> 00:40:24,689
TALIESIN: I was just going to keep rolling eights
until something else happened.

592
00:40:24,689 --> 00:40:26,333
MARISHA: What color bowler?

593
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:30,504
TALIESIN: The green bowler. Been a while.

594
00:40:30,504 --> 00:40:32,714
MARISHA: You get to wear a hat on a hat if you
want!

595
00:40:32,714 --> 00:40:35,460
TALIESIN: I'm going to wear a fez on a bowler.

596
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,122
MARISHA: Fez on a bowler, there you go.

597
00:40:37,122 --> 00:40:38,210
MATT: A fowler.

598
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:39,371
MARISHA: A fowler?

599
00:40:39,371 --> 00:40:41,243
SAM: That works.

600
00:40:41,243 --> 00:40:43,342
LIAM: Jeez, you're that guy in a western.

601
00:40:43,342 --> 00:40:45,466
SAM: You just hacked that hat.

602
00:40:45,466 --> 00:40:47,472
TALIESIN: There we are.

603
00:40:47,472 --> 00:40:55,656
MARISHA: You guys are feeling pretty good about
your hats.

604
00:40:55,656 --> 00:40:57,595
MATT: This is worth the price of admission, right
here.

605
00:40:57,595 --> 00:41:02,715
LIAM: Somebody get an organ grinder, stat!
(sings)

606
00:41:02,715 --> 00:41:05,555
BRIAN: Sam looks like Beary Busey!

607
00:41:05,555 --> 00:41:12,077
(laughter)

608
00:41:12,077 --> 00:41:13,870
MARISHA: That's a good code name.

609
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:14,924
MATT: Hey Vegas.

610
00:41:14,924 --> 00:41:15,969
BRIAN: Yeah?

611
00:41:15,969 --> 00:41:21,522
MATT: Good job. With these hats, there's no way
anybody in the town of Westruun would think that

612
00:41:21,522 --> 00:41:22,574
we're bears.

613
00:41:22,574 --> 00:41:25,205
BRIAN: Had to poke a little butt to get them, but
in the end--

614
00:41:25,205 --> 00:41:27,240
MATT: Haven't we all?

615
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,636
BRIAN: The butt went away.

616
00:41:28,636 --> 00:41:34,375
LIAM: I have another brilliant idea.

617
00:41:34,375 --> 00:41:36,331
MATT: What you got, Cookie?

618
00:41:36,331 --> 00:41:42,900
LIAM: We ripped down these banners. My brother hacked
the system. They're really big. I can tear this

619
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:48,855
shit with my claw and make each of us a cloak to go
with our hats. Then we'll look even more human.

620
00:41:48,929 --> 00:41:53,542
SAM: You are smarter than the average us!

621
00:41:53,542 --> 00:41:57,622
LIAM: Three years in bear college, my friend!

622
00:41:57,622 --> 00:41:58,895
SAM: Oh wow!

623
00:41:58,895 --> 00:42:01,903
BRIAN: Wait, how many years?

624
00:42:01,903 --> 00:42:06,691
LIAM: Three.

625
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:08,020
BRIAN: Wow!

626
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:09,280
SAM: Getting hungry.

627
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,565
MATT: That's right, we've got some honey to get
to. Come on, guys.

628
00:42:11,565 --> 00:42:16,776
MARISHA: With that confidence, you stroll right on
up. See if you can test your luck with the guards,

629
00:42:16,776 --> 00:42:17,948
I guess.

630
00:42:17,948 --> 00:42:23,482
LIAM: Here's your cloak. Red cloak. Red cloak.
We're going to be the black cloaks.

631
00:42:23,482 --> 00:42:29,662
MARISHA: They're like giant pendants that you put
holes in, so you've got nice little ascots now.

632
00:42:29,662 --> 00:42:35,624
Very distinguished! Very festive!

633
00:42:35,624 --> 00:42:38,005
MATT: Stand up on our hind legs as vertical as we
can.

634
00:42:38,005 --> 00:42:41,797
TALIESIN: We are hirsute gentlemen!

635
00:42:41,797 --> 00:42:51,356
MARISHA: As you walk by, the one guard was like,
"Aw, jeez, do I still have shit in my eye? Oh,

636
00:42:51,356 --> 00:42:56,680
"welcome to the Hazel Festival, sirs. Go on in.
Jeez, can we go get Wet Wipes?"

637
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,761
LIAM: Keep it moving! Bidet!

638
00:42:58,761 --> 00:43:01,397
MATT and TALIESIN: (growling) Bidet!

639
00:43:01,397 --> 00:43:14,720
MARISHA: "Were those goliaths? Okay, let's go take
a break." You successfully enter the city. Is my

640
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:15,979
music going?

641
00:43:15,979 --> 00:43:19,816
MATT: It's going, yeah! I hear it.

642
00:43:19,816 --> 00:43:27,020
MARISHA: As you get closer into the city, you can
smell wonderful foods. You can see people bringing

643
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:35,024
in prized vegetables and they're entering them
into competitions. There's string quartets and

644
00:43:35,024 --> 00:43:41,334
people dancing in the streets. Mead vendors out in
the open. As you get closer, you actually see a

645
00:43:41,334 --> 00:43:48,855
three-story-tall, really derpy-looking statue of a
Westruun man with a cowboy hat, he's wearing a

646
00:43:48,855 --> 00:43:54,874
button down that looks a lot like the Texas state
flag. He's got a shitty voice box saying, "Welcome

647
00:43:54,874 --> 00:44:05,739
"to the Hazel Festival! Welcome to the Hazel--" and
it repeats every 30 seconds or so. Things are

648
00:44:05,739 --> 00:44:07,076
decorated around it.

649
00:44:07,076 --> 00:44:08,622
LIAM: You're in a Johnny Cab!

650
00:44:08,622 --> 00:44:19,210
MARISHA: Cookie, Waffle. You notice the scent of
honey wafting through the air. Peddy Tuxpin, you

651
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:27,722
notice the scent of bamboo in the air. It's a
little dried out and as you look down, you notice

652
00:44:27,722 --> 00:44:34,750
these little wooden bamboo sample spoons that have
been discarded all over the floor.

653
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:36,624
SAM: I'm going to pick them up and eat them.

654
00:44:36,624 --> 00:44:43,037
MARISHA: It tastes like it's got honey residual on
it. It's scraps, but there's some little drops of

655
00:44:43,037 --> 00:44:44,593
honey in sample cups.

656
00:44:44,593 --> 00:44:47,635
MATT: Peddy, people don't eat spoons off the
floor.

657
00:44:47,635 --> 00:44:49,990
SAM: Oh people, we're people, right.

658
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:54,155
MATT: We're people. Just grab them, hold them, and
we'll find a corner for you to have a feast.

659
00:44:54,155 --> 00:44:59,397
SAM: I pick them up. I pop one in my mouth like a
sucker.

660
00:44:59,397 --> 00:45:03,234
MARISHA: All right. You guys taste some.

661
00:45:03,234 --> 00:45:05,377
LIAM: Everybody act casual.

662
00:45:05,377 --> 00:45:07,414
SAM: It's like a cigarette.

663
00:45:07,414 --> 00:45:12,920
MATT: I can't pinpoint the source of the honey.
Any of you boys?

664
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,627
TALIESIN: I'm going to try to pinpoint the source
of the honey.

665
00:45:14,627 --> 00:45:16,306
LIAM: Same. I smell gold.

666
00:45:16,306 --> 00:45:21,692
MARISHA: Roll for bear.

667
00:45:21,692 --> 00:45:25,151
TALIESIN and LIAM: Nope.

668
00:45:25,151 --> 00:45:27,568
TALIESIN: I'm frustrated.

669
00:45:27,568 --> 00:45:30,068
MARISHA: Are you getting a little frustrated?

670
00:45:30,068 --> 00:45:31,296
TALIESIN: Yep.

671
00:45:31,296 --> 00:45:36,344
MARISHA: Then take and put a point into bear. It's
got to be lower than bear.

672
00:45:36,344 --> 00:45:38,908
LIAM: We're in trouble there.

673
00:45:38,908 --> 00:45:44,514
TALIESIN: There's a lot going on. We got to get
close to the source. There's too much happening.

674
00:45:44,514 --> 00:45:50,881
Bamboo's getting in there, it's mucking up the
system, man. This is a delicate instrument.

675
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:57,027
SAM: Guys, is this plan off the rails already?
Should I be worried? I'm freaking out!

676
00:45:57,027 --> 00:46:02,186
BRIAN: We got these great hats.

677
00:46:02,186 --> 00:46:04,207
SAM: These people are looking at us funny!

678
00:46:04,207 --> 00:46:10,686
MARISHA: About this time, you see an old couple
run by going, "Help! Has anyone seen any cows? We

679
00:46:10,686 --> 00:46:15,527
"lost our prized steer!" She's like, "Gerald, I
told you you should have tied them up!"

680
00:46:15,527 --> 00:46:17,952
LIAM: What the fuck is this shit?

681
00:46:17,952 --> 00:46:25,506
MARISHA: As they run by, you see Pike way off in
the distance. She's saying, "Anyone would like a

682
00:46:25,506 --> 00:46:31,409
"honey sample? Honey sample! Anybody? This is from
the Slayer's Cake! Vote for the Slayer's Cake!"

683
00:46:31,409 --> 00:46:34,727
LIAM: Holy shit, we eat the gnome and then we get
the honey.

684
00:46:34,727 --> 00:46:36,723
MATT: Nobody is eating the gnome!

685
00:46:36,723 --> 00:46:38,011
SAM: But she's so little!

686
00:46:38,011 --> 00:46:39,214
LIAM: She's covered in honey!

687
00:46:39,214 --> 00:46:41,731
MATT: She will destroy you, trust me.

688
00:46:41,731 --> 00:46:43,759
BRIAN: Is she poisonous if you bite into her?

689
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,351
MATT: Sure, we'll go with that.

690
00:46:45,351 --> 00:46:52,003
MARISHA: On the other side, you see Reginald's
daughter. What was her name? Aleria? It's

691
00:46:52,003 --> 00:46:59,486
somewhere in my notes. But it's Reginald's
daughter and she's going, "Honey samples! Try it

692
00:46:59,486 --> 00:47:03,606
"from the Reginald farm! Honey samples!"

693
00:47:03,606 --> 00:47:05,450
MATT: That one we could go towards.

694
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:06,595
SAM: And kill her?

695
00:47:06,595 --> 00:47:10,232
MATT: I'm going to approach and tell the other
guys to come along.

696
00:47:10,232 --> 00:47:13,748
SAM: We're going to talk to her? I'm freaking
out.

697
00:47:13,748 --> 00:47:15,488
MATT: It's all right, just suck on your spoon.

698
00:47:15,488 --> 00:47:16,937
SAM: I might just kill her.

699
00:47:16,937 --> 00:47:19,772
MATT: As I approach Reginald's daughter--

700
00:47:19,772 --> 00:47:26,493
MARISHA: Still really trying to find her. Damn, I
just wrote down Reginald's daughter. Ameera or

701
00:47:26,493 --> 00:47:29,659
something? Aleria, or Amelia? We'll call her
Amelia.

702
00:47:29,659 --> 00:47:36,433
MATT: I approach with my big bear arms at the
side, my cloak over my armor and my delightful

703
00:47:36,433 --> 00:47:40,228
cap. Get close to the honey and (sniff).

704
00:47:40,228 --> 00:47:51,008
MARISHA: She looks at you a little confused and
goes, "Hello?"

705
00:47:51,008 --> 00:47:54,130
MATT: (bear voice) Thank you.

706
00:47:54,130 --> 00:48:04,491
MARISHA: She turns around to a friend and is like,
"I'm not one to judge, but--" She shuffles away, a

707
00:48:04,491 --> 00:48:07,873
little uncomfortable.

708
00:48:07,873 --> 00:48:13,051
MATT: I took a bite of it, a little bit. I take
the rest of it and hold it out and say: One of you

709
00:48:13,051 --> 00:48:17,916
bears, please, find the source of this goddamn
honey.

710
00:48:17,916 --> 00:48:19,880
BRIAN: Why did you give it to him?

711
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,112
SAM: He said bears.

712
00:48:22,112 --> 00:48:23,386
BRIAN: Oh!

713
00:48:23,386 --> 00:48:27,023
LIAM: (groaning) It's good!

714
00:48:27,023 --> 00:48:28,527
TALIESIN: It's not bad!

715
00:48:28,527 --> 00:48:32,779
LIAM: I like you, city bear. I like you.

716
00:48:32,779 --> 00:48:34,330
TALIESIN: We're going places.

717
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:38,435
LIAM: We could do big things together. I smell
honey, Waffle, I smell it!

718
00:48:38,435 --> 00:48:39,906
TALIESIN: Oh, I taste it.

719
00:48:39,906 --> 00:48:46,793
MARISHA: About this time, you see the last and
third contestant in the honey competition,

720
00:48:46,793 --> 00:48:55,072
wandering on the opposite side of the fountain.
He's going, "Yes! Vote for me! It's Victor! V

721
00:48:55,072 --> 00:49:06,061
"stands for voting! It's a secret recipe! Try my
secret recipe!" Trinket, you get this waft in the

722
00:49:06,061 --> 00:49:16,070
air and you're looking at the honey, it's got this
grayish tint to it. You recognize: this is the

723
00:49:16,070 --> 00:49:18,472
same smell that comes out of Percy's boom-boom
tube.

724
00:49:18,472 --> 00:49:22,310
MATT: Oh no. How many people are in the audience?

725
00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:23,428
MARISHA: A decent amount!

726
00:49:23,428 --> 00:49:24,687
MATT: Oh no!

727
00:49:24,687 --> 00:49:32,672
MARISHA: A decent amount, people are all over the
place, they're mixing in. They're going to Pike

728
00:49:32,672 --> 00:49:37,610
and then they're going to Victor, then they're
going to Reginald's daughter, they're jumping

729
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:38,457
around.

730
00:49:38,457 --> 00:49:42,569
MATT: First and foremost, considering the utility
of that honey, I'm going to take a sample and pack

731
00:49:42,569 --> 00:49:45,357
it under my bear pit for later.

732
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:49,385
MARISHA: "Vote for V!"

733
00:49:49,385 --> 00:49:50,908
MATT: (bear voice) Thank you!

734
00:49:50,908 --> 00:49:55,449
TALIESIN: I got an idea. I'm going to try
something. I'm going to wander up to Victor.

735
00:49:55,449 --> 00:49:59,407
MARISHA: "Hello there, hairy fellow! Would you
like some honey?"

736
00:49:59,407 --> 00:50:06,286
TALIESIN: I dip my paw just a little bit and go,
Mm!

737
00:50:06,286 --> 00:50:16,407
MARISHA: "Oh! You like it a lot, big guy? Okay!"
And he starts scooping it into the hat.

738
00:50:16,407 --> 00:50:19,042
TALIESIN: I'm going to fill the fez with honey.
With gunpowder honey.

739
00:50:19,042 --> 00:50:20,328
LIAM: That's about a hogshead worth.

740
00:50:20,328 --> 00:50:23,479
TALIESIN: About a hogshead worth. Easily have a
hogshead there.

741
00:50:23,479 --> 00:50:32,209
MARISHA: "Remember, vote for me, though! The V
stands-- vote for me!"

742
00:50:32,209 --> 00:50:34,421
TALIESIN: (amenable growling)

743
00:50:34,421 --> 00:50:38,539
BRIAN: Don't spill it!

744
00:50:38,539 --> 00:50:40,842
TALIESIN: We're in.

745
00:50:40,842 --> 00:50:47,381
MATT: Nobody jostle any of these townsfolk too
hard. They're probably a little sensitive at the

746
00:50:47,381 --> 00:50:48,760
moment.

747
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:51,726
LIAM: Little gassy, you think?

748
00:50:51,726 --> 00:50:59,129
MATT: You'll see. We don't want that honey, we
have enough there. The prize honey is what that

749
00:50:59,129 --> 00:51:04,302
little one had earlier. Or (squishing) where this
came from.

750
00:51:04,302 --> 00:51:06,955
BRIAN: My goodness.

751
00:51:06,955 --> 00:51:12,078
MATT: I didn't think about my hat at the time. I
don't have pockets. I'm storing it in my bear pit.

752
00:51:12,078 --> 00:51:21,903
TALIESIN: That's Whitestone wildflower, touch of
Feywild star iris. That's good. That's real good.

753
00:51:21,903 --> 00:51:23,949
MATT: All right, lead us on.

754
00:51:23,949 --> 00:51:25,960
TALIESIN: (sniffs)

755
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:28,072
MARISHA: Which direction are you guys going?

756
00:51:28,072 --> 00:51:31,415
LIAM: Wait a minute. You got a whole hatful of
honey. Can I have a little honey?

757
00:51:31,415 --> 00:51:34,313
MARISHA: You may certainly have honey.

758
00:51:34,313 --> 00:51:36,628
LIAM: I'm going take a little bite of this honey.

759
00:51:36,628 --> 00:51:38,393
TALIESIN: We're going to need this for later.

760
00:51:38,393 --> 00:51:45,439
MATT: As he's putting it in his mouth, I grab the
edge. Are you sure about this?

761
00:51:45,439 --> 00:51:48,116
LIAM: (swallows)

762
00:51:48,116 --> 00:51:57,000
MARISHA: It's good, all things considered. It's a
little smoky taste to it. Still tastes like honey,

763
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,383
just a little sulfury.

764
00:51:58,383 --> 00:52:02,425
LIAM: I've had honey with jalapeno in it, a little
bit of hot pepper.

765
00:52:02,425 --> 00:52:04,737
MARISHA: It's gritty. It's got a little bit of
crunch in your teeth.

766
00:52:04,737 --> 00:52:06,630
BRIAN: Someone relieve themselves in the batch?

767
00:52:06,707 --> 00:52:08,306
MATT: More or less.

768
00:52:08,306 --> 00:52:13,895
LIAM: Texture. Does that put me back towards bear,
though?

769
00:52:13,895 --> 00:52:15,111
MARISHA: Huh?

770
00:52:15,111 --> 00:52:17,082
LIAM: I had some honey; don't we get towards bear
if we have honey?

771
00:52:17,082 --> 00:52:23,799
MARISHA: You have to have a nice pawful. You've
got to get a-- a sample's not going to work

772
00:52:23,799 --> 00:52:25,558
LIAM: All right.

773
00:52:25,558 --> 00:52:35,114
MARISHA: Once again, you might want to stockpile
some honey. It's not a bad idea. You hear a

774
00:52:35,114 --> 00:52:41,720
carnival barker come out on the stage built
temporarily on the town square. He goes, "Welcome,

775
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:55,359
"everyone, the Fire Ashari cultural dance troupe!"
(drumbeat) Fire spinners come out and start doing

776
00:52:55,359 --> 00:53:05,007
fire poi. Fire breather comes out! Over the crowd.
Everyone's like, "Yeah!" They go rushing up to the stage.

777
00:53:05,007 --> 00:53:09,495
BRIAN: I run up and start dancing with all of
them, my drape flying everywhere.

778
00:53:09,495 --> 00:53:12,685
MARISHA: Drunk people are like, "Yeah, look at
this little guy!"

779
00:53:12,685 --> 00:53:16,142
SAM: I can't be here right now! No!

780
00:53:16,142 --> 00:53:21,194
MATT: Listen! You guys. We have to get those fire
dancers out of here or get the rest of these

781
00:53:21,194 --> 00:53:26,136
villagers out of the center here or we're all
dead. That honey you got right there, that touches

782
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:29,756
any of that boom boom fire stick, we all go boom.

783
00:53:29,756 --> 00:53:32,153
TALIESIN: My god.

784
00:53:32,153 --> 00:53:39,047
BRIAN: I run back over. You guys! You got to come
up, oh man, it's crazy up front! Oh man, the

785
00:53:39,047 --> 00:53:40,491
honey's blue up there!

786
00:53:40,491 --> 00:53:42,670
SAM: I can't go up there, I'm scared of fire!

787
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:51,198
MARISHA: You see a roaming, free-wandering chicken
that comes up and you can tell it's eating any and

788
00:53:51,198 --> 00:53:58,023
all trash that it comes across on the floor. As a
spark of ash, a piece of flint flies off the fire

789
00:53:58,023 --> 00:54:06,804
dancers and falls in front of it. Chicken eats it
mindlessly. (squawk) It explodes and bursts into a

790
00:54:06,804 --> 00:54:13,758
poof of feathers. Everyone turns, looks over in
your direction.

791
00:54:13,758 --> 00:54:21,241
MATT: I got a plan. Do you have a direction where
the honey's from that I gave you earlier?

792
00:54:21,241 --> 00:54:23,103
TALIESIN: I'm going to try to smell it again.

793
00:54:23,103 --> 00:54:24,011
MARISHA: All right.

794
00:54:24,011 --> 00:54:27,404
MATT: Please, for the love of god.

795
00:54:27,404 --> 00:54:32,355
TALIESIN: Yes! Yes I do! That way!

796
00:54:32,355 --> 00:54:38,154
MARISHA: You can smell that it's coming from the
Opal District a little bit, a really nice tavern

797
00:54:38,154 --> 00:54:40,522
called the Sun Kissed Inn in that direction.

798
00:54:40,522 --> 00:54:44,906
MATT: You guys start heading that way. I'll catch
up to you in a minute, I know where the Sun Kissed

799
00:54:44,906 --> 00:54:48,921
Tavern is. I'm going to try to save some lives.

800
00:54:48,921 --> 00:54:54,651
MARISHA: You bears split off into a back alleyway
and start following Cookie and Waffle.

801
00:54:54,651 --> 00:54:58,833
LIAM: I was liking that guy, but I don't know. We
don't need any martyrs in this group.

802
00:54:58,833 --> 00:55:07,094
MATT: As the townsfolk are gathering around this
fire troupe, I'm going to try to step between the

803
00:55:07,094 --> 00:55:15,543
threshold of where the various honey-eating folk
and the fire spinners are. Step into that central area.

804
00:55:15,543 --> 00:55:18,298
LIAM: What's the range on the Vex necklace?

805
00:55:18,298 --> 00:55:20,711
MATT: I don't know where she is, so we'll find
out.

806
00:55:20,711 --> 00:55:30,583
MARISHA: Yep, neither do I! She's real busy right
now. People are dancing and they're cheering,

807
00:55:30,583 --> 00:55:32,789
they're eating the honey. Really stoked.

808
00:55:32,789 --> 00:55:41,205
MATT: As they begin to encroach, I shake my head
for a second, pull my hat and cloak off, and

809
00:55:41,205 --> 00:55:48,537
(roar) towards all of the townsfolk, away from the
fire dancers. Attempting to use my terrify special skill.

810
00:55:48,537 --> 00:55:52,575
MARISHA: Roll 2d6 under bear and take the lower.

811
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:56,032
MATT: Two and a three!

812
00:55:56,032 --> 00:56:02,292
MARISHA: Kids immediately get snapped out of their
dancing trance. Drunk people instantly sober.

813
00:56:02,292 --> 00:56:06,521
Everyone screams and takes off running into the
other direction.

814
00:56:06,521 --> 00:56:10,157
MATT: I turn around to the fire dancers.
(growling)

815
00:56:10,157 --> 00:56:19,924
MARISHA: You can tell a low level one person goes
(groaning) and makes flame, but nothing really

816
00:56:19,924 --> 00:56:21,306
comes out.

817
00:56:21,306 --> 00:56:28,997
MATT: I throw the cloak back over my shoulder,
take one of the fire sticks. Bidet! And start

818
00:56:28,997 --> 00:56:31,502
heading in the direction of the Sun Kissed
Tavern.

819
00:56:31,502 --> 00:56:33,562
MARISHA: (yelling) She screams and runs off.

820
00:56:33,562 --> 00:56:35,769
MATT: Do I have to move a point anywhere for
that?

821
00:56:35,769 --> 00:56:41,222
MARISHA: That was a successful criminal action, so
point from bear to criminal.

822
00:56:41,222 --> 00:56:43,615
TALIESIN: Good grabbing the stick.

823
00:56:43,615 --> 00:56:45,831
MATT: I'm holding the flame stick with me now.

824
00:56:45,831 --> 00:56:53,947
MARISHA: You see Pike, off in the distance, start
looking and moving people out of the way.

825
00:56:53,947 --> 00:56:55,583
MATT: I get as low as I can.

826
00:56:55,583 --> 00:57:01,833
MARISHA: "What do you mean, a bear? What did the
bear look like?" She is demanding from other

827
00:57:01,833 --> 00:57:08,806
people that are screaming in panic right now. You've
successfully wreaked havoc. You hear a few guards

828
00:57:08,806 --> 00:57:21,560
call out, "Those bears got in the city! Damn it,
O'Donnell!" Keep moving. The rest of you bears,

829
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:29,126
you sneak off, go around, heading your way towards
the tavern.

830
00:57:29,126 --> 00:57:30,519
LIAM: You got a bead on it?

831
00:57:30,519 --> 00:57:32,701
TALIESIN: Yeah. I think I can hack it.

832
00:57:32,701 --> 00:57:36,958
LIAM: We're going to stick to the alleyways, we're
going to make our way there quietly. All right?

833
00:57:36,958 --> 00:57:38,184
TALIESIN: Quiet.

834
00:57:38,184 --> 00:57:39,531
LIAM: Little guy?

835
00:57:39,531 --> 00:57:40,606
BRIAN: Huh?

836
00:57:40,606 --> 00:57:41,447
LIAM: Vegas.

837
00:57:41,447 --> 00:57:42,303
BRIAN: Yeah!

838
00:57:42,303 --> 00:57:43,273
LIAM: Take point!

839
00:57:43,273 --> 00:57:44,834
BRIAN: How many?

840
00:57:44,834 --> 00:57:46,907
LIAM: 15 HB.

841
00:57:46,907 --> 00:57:49,688
BRIAN: Okay. What else?

842
00:57:49,688 --> 00:57:54,724
LIAM: Just get ahead of us, look around the corner,
see if anybody's coming. If there's anybody there--

843
00:57:54,724 --> 00:57:56,291
BRIAN: Kill them immediately.

844
00:57:56,291 --> 00:57:59,490
LIAM: You're two feet tall; don't kill them
immediately, just give us a signal!

845
00:57:59,490 --> 00:58:02,074
BRIAN: And then they get on the ground, and then I
go at the neck.

846
00:58:02,074 --> 00:58:07,954
LIAM: It's a good thing you're a good at pulling
thorns out of our paws, I'm telling you, Vegas.

847
00:58:07,954 --> 00:58:10,636
BRIAN: Suck poison out, too, if I really needed
to.

848
00:58:10,636 --> 00:58:12,368
LIAM: Get up there, earn your fucking keep.

849
00:58:12,368 --> 00:58:15,657
BRIAN: Okay! I run over and crawl down to the
thing.

850
00:58:15,657 --> 00:58:18,110
TALIESIN: Damn honey badger don't need any lip.

851
00:58:18,110 --> 00:58:19,825
BRIAN: Eh, shut up.

852
00:58:19,825 --> 00:58:29,918
MARISHA: Peek around a corner, look left, look
right. You see a discarded wheelbarrow, a few

853
00:58:29,918 --> 00:58:34,373
discarded carts, some trash.

854
00:58:34,373 --> 00:58:41,260
BRIAN: I want a cart. I'm the HB Driver.

855
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:48,149
MARISHA: You veer off, you take a closer look. One's
a little pull-behind cart that has shoulder

856
00:58:48,149 --> 00:58:54,928
straps. It'd be one of the bigger ones.
There's a wheelbarrow. Looks tinier, made of wood,

857
00:58:54,967 --> 00:59:02,745
but you might be able to maneuver it. It looks
like a little kid wagon, is basically what it is.

858
00:59:02,745 --> 00:59:04,230
SAM: Vegas, what you got up there?

859
00:59:04,230 --> 00:59:06,818
BRIAN: I'm looking for one that looks like the
A-Team van!

860
00:59:06,818 --> 00:59:13,137
SAM: I don't know what that-- no! I'm not from
around here. I'm an out-of-towner.

861
00:59:13,137 --> 00:59:14,591
LIAM: Bee-Team, come on!

862
00:59:14,591 --> 00:59:16,621
BRIAN: There's some carts and a wheelbarrow!

863
00:59:16,621 --> 00:59:18,227
SAM: A cart?

864
00:59:18,227 --> 00:59:19,237
BRIAN: Yeah!

865
00:59:19,237 --> 00:59:20,896
SAM: I can lift a cart.

866
00:59:20,896 --> 00:59:23,344
BRIAN: Okay. Take the cart.

867
00:59:23,344 --> 00:59:31,146
MARISHA: You push on the cart a little bit. Wheel
falls off and collapses. Looks like it's been

868
00:59:31,146 --> 00:59:41,998
there for a while. As it collapses, behind that is
a shiny, chrome metallic, little black detailing

869
00:59:41,998 --> 00:59:48,418
racing stripes on the side-- It's like a little
Radio Flyer wagon.

870
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:50,956
LIAM: Does it say de Rolo on it?

871
00:59:50,956 --> 00:59:55,515
MARISHA: It, in fact, does say de Rolo on it.

872
00:59:55,515 --> 01:00:06,393
BRIAN: Okay, so there's some really shiny shit
here. I'm going to use extreme caution bringing it

873
01:00:06,393 --> 01:00:11,749
down the hallway. I'm going to move all the shit
out of the way and pull it down.

874
01:00:11,749 --> 01:00:15,261
TALIESIN: Vegas, are you sure you can maneuver
this thing? You seen something like this before?

875
01:00:15,261 --> 01:00:18,764
MARISHA: Roll a criminal check as you're trying to
be stealthy.

876
01:00:18,764 --> 01:00:20,401
TALIESIN: This thing looks complicated.

877
01:00:20,401 --> 01:00:22,778
LIAM and BRIAN: How big is it?

878
01:00:22,778 --> 01:00:24,134
TALIESIN: Bigger than a honeypot?

879
01:00:24,134 --> 01:00:28,654
MARISHA: It's bigger than a honeypot. It's a Radio
Flyer, it's a little wagon!

880
01:00:28,654 --> 01:00:30,850
LIAM: So it's big enough for Vegas, but not for a
bunch of bears.

881
01:00:30,850 --> 01:00:31,816
MARISHA: Yeah.

882
01:00:31,816 --> 01:00:32,974
BRIAN: Success.

883
01:00:32,974 --> 01:00:40,965
MARISHA: Success? You shift some things aside. You
hear a rustle from the house. Don't move for a

884
01:00:40,965 --> 01:00:46,508
second. "George! George!"

885
01:00:46,508 --> 01:00:49,147
BRIAN: Who the fuck's George? Do we know who
George is?

886
01:00:49,147 --> 01:00:54,750
MARISHA: "Goddamn my piece of shit husband." She
wanders off. You can continue.

887
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:56,442
BRIAN: (low scraping).

888
01:00:56,442 --> 01:00:59,601
MARISHA: (squeaking) Liam Las Vegas comes back.

889
01:00:59,601 --> 01:01:02,050
BRIAN: Guys, look! Behold!

890
01:01:02,050 --> 01:01:04,693
SAM: What we do with that?

891
01:01:04,693 --> 01:01:13,886
BRIAN: We can put honey in it! And if someone
gets injured, we could--

892
01:01:13,886 --> 01:01:15,639
SAM: What?

893
01:01:15,639 --> 01:01:19,409
BRIAN: Put their honey in it so they can focus
on walking!

894
01:01:19,409 --> 01:01:21,375
SAM: That's really smart!

895
01:01:21,375 --> 01:01:24,293
TALIESIN: I put my honey in the wagon.

896
01:01:24,293 --> 01:01:26,284
LIAM: Yeah, smart.

897
01:01:26,284 --> 01:01:29,222
TALIESIN: Yeah, that really frees me up. Good
thinking.

898
01:01:29,222 --> 01:01:33,734
MARISHA: You're all stealthing, keep moving down the
alleyways.

899
01:01:33,734 --> 01:01:35,711
TALIESIN: The wagon with a fez full of honey.

900
01:01:35,711 --> 01:01:38,343
SAM: I'm looking for anything that looks like
bamboo.

901
01:01:38,343 --> 01:01:48,616
MARISHA: You're eating the trash along the way.
There's a few foliage and trees that look

902
01:01:48,616 --> 01:01:49,578
bamboo-y.

903
01:01:49,578 --> 01:01:50,610
SAM: I'll eat them!

904
01:01:50,610 --> 01:01:57,844
MARISHA: There's a few cattail rods and fronds
that are not too bad.

905
01:01:57,844 --> 01:02:00,761
LIAM: We don't have the city bear back yet,
right?

906
01:02:00,761 --> 01:02:06,203
MARISHA: Not yet. Actually, about this time, as
you guys come around the corner you run, coming

907
01:02:06,203 --> 01:02:09,160
down the alleyway, right into Trinket.

908
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:10,358
LIAM: What's up, big guy?

909
01:02:10,358 --> 01:02:12,489
SAM: What happened? There was a lot of commotion
back there!

910
01:02:12,489 --> 01:02:16,505
MATT: Don't worry about it. We need to get to
the tavern. I look down and see the fez in the

911
01:02:16,505 --> 01:02:20,013
cart and I hold the fire rod away.

912
01:02:20,013 --> 01:02:22,865
SAM and BRIAN: What's wrong?

913
01:02:22,865 --> 01:02:26,654
MATT: Safety tip: this doesn't touch that.

914
01:02:26,654 --> 01:02:28,897
TALIESIN: That's an important safety tip.

915
01:02:28,897 --> 01:02:30,925
SAM: Get that thing away from me; I don't like
fire.

916
01:02:30,925 --> 01:02:36,735
TALIESIN: He's wearing a fez, too, you don't want
to get that anywhere near that. It's very

917
01:02:36,735 --> 01:02:38,208
flammable.

918
01:02:38,208 --> 01:02:41,176
MATT: I point again and say, this also doesn't
touch that.

919
01:02:41,176 --> 01:02:42,521
SAM: What?

920
01:02:42,521 --> 01:02:44,163
LIAM: Well, I don't like to burn.

921
01:02:44,163 --> 01:02:46,338
MATT: Remember that chicken?

922
01:02:46,338 --> 01:02:51,656
LIAM: Uh-huh. What, are you saying there's a
correlation?

923
01:02:51,656 --> 01:02:52,749
BRIAN: You ate the--

924
01:02:52,749 --> 01:02:56,769
MATT: Don't worry about it. Sun Kissed Tavern.
Keep leading us on with that beautiful nose of yours.

925
01:02:56,769 --> 01:02:59,567
TALIESIN: Here's a question: How do you spell Sun
Kissed? And I can't read.

926
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:03,344
MATT: Shit.

927
01:03:03,344 --> 01:03:09,082
SAM: Let's keep following the smell.

928
01:03:09,082 --> 01:03:11,491
MATT: Maybe it's got pictures.

929
01:03:11,491 --> 01:03:16,904
MARISHA: Out of one of the side alleys, as you
guys are having this conversation, you hear

930
01:03:16,904 --> 01:03:23,776
(clopping). See that, I'm fucking Dee Bradley
Baker up in here.

931
01:03:23,776 --> 01:03:30,742
SAM: Did you just self Dee Bradley Baker
yourself?!

932
01:03:30,742 --> 01:03:38,908
MARISHA: Yeah, I did! I didn't plan those, I
didn't practice those ahead of time. It's not too bad.

933
01:03:38,908 --> 01:03:41,081
LIAM: That's a joke for 83 people.

934
01:03:41,081 --> 01:03:47,370
TALIESIN: I don't feel good about that.

935
01:03:47,370 --> 01:03:54,844
BRIAN: That was up there with all of Dee Bradley
Baker's monsters for sure.

936
01:03:54,844 --> 01:03:56,051
MARISHA: Totally!

937
01:03:56,051 --> 01:03:59,129
LIAM: I give that joke five bear claws out of
five. Very nice!

938
01:03:59,129 --> 01:04:08,447
MARISHA: You see two silhouettes coming out of the
shadows, also wearing hats. One has horns coming

939
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:17,893
out of it. Two cows, also trying to pass as
civilians, come up to you and go, "Well, well,

940
01:04:17,893 --> 01:04:23,755
"well! What do we have here? It looks like we got
ourselves a couple of wise bears!" They're holding

941
01:04:23,755 --> 01:04:28,383
a stick like it's a tommy gun, but it's definitely
a stick.

942
01:04:28,383 --> 01:04:31,350
TALIESIN: Careful kids, they've got sticks.

943
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:36,495
LIAM: Hey, friend. Let me ask you something. Are
you one of those cow-cows or one of those

944
01:04:36,495 --> 01:04:40,329
people-passing-themselves-off-as-cows? Just to
avoid confusion.

945
01:04:40,329 --> 01:04:47,507
MARISHA: "Look, wise guy. I'm a prize cow. Do you
know who we are? We're the blue ribbon winners

946
01:04:47,507 --> 01:04:53,695
"here at the Hazel Festival. Yeah, that's right.
And you know what? Me, oh, this here is Bonnie."

947
01:04:53,695 --> 01:05:07,538
She goes, "Hi! You tell them, Cow!" He goes,
"That's Bonnie and I'm Cow. We're tired of living

948
01:05:07,538 --> 01:05:11,236
like second-class livestock, you hear?"

949
01:05:11,236 --> 01:05:14,852
SAM: Point of clarification: They're holding
sticks?

950
01:05:14,852 --> 01:05:18,429
MARISHA: They're holding sticks. Like tommy guns.

951
01:05:18,429 --> 01:05:21,952
SAM: Yeah!

952
01:05:21,952 --> 01:05:25,338
BRIAN: I'm pulling a Radio Flyer!

953
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:27,480
SAM: You have digits!

954
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:33,597
BRIAN: I do, but still. Cows can carry things.

955
01:05:33,597 --> 01:05:37,018
MARISHA: It's balanced. It's tucked up under.

956
01:05:37,018 --> 01:05:39,626
TALIESIN: It's a Far Side cartoon, just go with
it.

957
01:05:39,626 --> 01:05:45,821
LIAM: Beefcake! I don't think we have a problem
here. There's not a lot of overlap: you guys like

958
01:05:45,821 --> 01:05:48,252
grass, you guys like ribbons.

959
01:05:48,252 --> 01:05:52,368
MARISHA: "Oh, do we? Do we like grass? Are you
going to start telling me about myself now? Look

960
01:05:52,368 --> 01:05:55,778
"at these guys, Bonnie." "Yeah, you tell them,
Cow!" "Yeah!"

961
01:05:55,778 --> 01:05:57,907
BRIAN: You also like to be milked.

962
01:05:57,907 --> 01:06:03,049
MARISHA: "All right, you know what? You bears, you
get to enjoy your honey. You get to enjoy all

963
01:06:03,049 --> 01:06:10,763
"these fruits and all these bamboos. And we get
stuck with hay. And I'm just here to say we're tired of

964
01:06:10,763 --> 01:06:13,494
"it! Aren't we, Bonnie?" "Yeah!"

965
01:06:13,494 --> 01:06:19,521
SAM: I step forward and crack my bear knuckles and
say: If you're so sick and tired of it, why don't

966
01:06:19,521 --> 01:06:23,881
you make a move? Come on, let's end this right
here. Let's settle it.

967
01:06:23,881 --> 01:06:25,702
BRIAN: Take a shit on them, Peddy!

968
01:06:25,702 --> 01:06:29,035
SAM: I don't shit where I eat!

969
01:06:29,035 --> 01:06:32,263
BRIAN: Well, then shit on the one you're not going
to eat!

970
01:06:32,263 --> 01:06:33,928
SAM: Okay! That makes more sense!

971
01:06:33,928 --> 01:06:39,505
MARISHA: "Is that a threat? Is that supposed to be
some sort of hamburger threat? I get it! I'm a

972
01:06:39,505 --> 01:06:44,525
"cow, I've heard them all! All right. You want to
throw down? That honey's ours. All right, let's

973
01:06:44,525 --> 01:06:45,508
"throw down!"

974
01:06:45,508 --> 01:06:46,762
SAM: Let's do this!

975
01:06:46,762 --> 01:06:48,772
TALIESIN: Did the cow just drop his stick?

976
01:06:48,772 --> 01:06:51,328
MARISHA: He did!

977
01:06:51,328 --> 01:06:56,640
MATT: Here's my question. How much like bamboo do
those sticks look?

978
01:06:56,640 --> 01:07:04,531
MARISHA: They look pretty good. They look like
some pretty tasty-looking sticks. They're still

979
01:07:04,531 --> 01:07:06,699
green. He dropped it on the floor.

980
01:07:06,699 --> 01:07:08,972
MATT: I lean over to Peddy and say: Disarm them.

981
01:07:08,972 --> 01:07:12,525
SAM: I pounce with panda speed!

982
01:07:12,525 --> 01:07:14,131
BRIAN: Yes!

983
01:07:14,131 --> 01:07:20,635
SAM: I throw myself on the stick and I bite it in
half!

984
01:07:20,685 --> 01:07:22,760
LIAM: Fuck 'em up, Peddy!

985
01:07:22,807 --> 01:07:25,270
MARISHA: As you bite down on the stick--

986
01:07:25,270 --> 01:07:27,514
BRIAN: Gnaw on that knob, Peddy!

987
01:07:27,514 --> 01:07:33,452
MARISHA: --you realize there's actually something
a little bit different about this stick. It has a

988
01:07:33,452 --> 01:07:41,026
shimmer to it, it's not as easy to bite through.
You realize this is actually a magic stick.

989
01:07:41,026 --> 01:07:51,258
SAM: What?! Is this true?!

990
01:07:51,258 --> 01:07:53,161
MARISHA: Yeah!

991
01:07:53,161 --> 01:07:55,324
SAM: Like, now?

992
01:07:55,324 --> 01:07:58,348
MARISHA: You can certainly try.

993
01:07:58,348 --> 01:08:00,000
SAM: This is a spell I can do?

994
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:10,698
MARISHA: It's a stick that, when you use it, it
turns into a giant whacking trunk. Yeah.

995
01:08:10,698 --> 01:08:18,286
SAM: Wait, that's this, yeah? When I use this
stick, I become two bears?

996
01:08:18,286 --> 01:08:25,678
MARISHA: No. Wait, what? Oh, I gave you the wrong
one! That's what you needed.

997
01:08:25,678 --> 01:08:40,009
SAM: This makes much more sense! But I don't have
to use it now, but have this item.

998
01:08:40,009 --> 01:08:41,329
MARISHA: You now have it.

999
01:08:41,329 --> 01:08:48,567
SAM: Okay, great. I can't bite it in half! I'll
just hold onto it with my digits that I have.

1000
01:08:48,567 --> 01:08:56,147
MARISHA: Bonnie and Cow go, "Moo!" and start
trying to stampede you all. What do you do?

1001
01:08:56,147 --> 01:09:03,806
TALIESIN: I take off my cloak and I'm going to try
and bull them out into one of the buildings.

1002
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:05,313
MARISHA: Roll for criminal.

1003
01:09:05,313 --> 01:09:06,516
TALIESIN: This is all criminal.

1004
01:09:06,516 --> 01:09:10,898
MARISHA: Roll for being a cow hacker. You're cow
hacking.

1005
01:09:10,898 --> 01:09:15,441
TALIESIN: Bovine hacking. Classic. I rolled a
four, I do not hack.

1006
01:09:15,441 --> 01:09:22,052
MARISHA: He doesn't fall for it. He tramples right
over you. You get knocked prone on the ground. You

1007
01:09:22,052 --> 01:09:24,280
get aggravated and take a point in bear.

1008
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:28,820
LIAM: I'm going to grab Las Vegas by the scruff of
the neck off the Radio Flyer and I'm going to try

1009
01:09:28,820 --> 01:09:31,201
to chuck him on top of Cow.

1010
01:09:31,201 --> 01:09:32,351
MARISHA: All right!

1011
01:09:32,351 --> 01:09:34,860
BRIAN: I'll get on there and I'll start going
carnage, yeah.

1012
01:09:34,860 --> 01:09:41,327
MARISHA: Do fastball special, land on top of him,
get a nice little foam going in the mouth. It's

1013
01:09:41,327 --> 01:09:43,369
good. Roll 2d6.

1014
01:09:43,369 --> 01:09:45,541
LIAM: You're the driver; steer that shit!

1015
01:09:45,541 --> 01:09:48,298
BRIAN: One and two!

1016
01:09:48,298 --> 01:09:55,601
MARISHA: You start tearing at the throat of Cow.
Poor Cow didn't know what was coming to him.

1017
01:09:55,601 --> 01:09:57,013
Scruff is getting--

1018
01:09:57,013 --> 01:09:58,494
BRIAN: Eat more chicken!

1019
01:09:58,494 --> 01:10:05,793
MARISHA: He goes down pretty good. Bonnie turns
and goes, "What?! No! You monsters!" and she turns

1020
01:10:05,793 --> 01:10:07,946
and goes for you, Trinket.

1021
01:10:07,946 --> 01:10:17,696
MATT: As she rears towards me, I get down and be
as imposing a grizzly figure as I can, and give a

1022
01:10:17,696 --> 01:10:23,418
very focused, centered roar right in her
direction. (roars)

1023
01:10:23,418 --> 01:10:25,425
MARISHA: Roll for terrify.

1024
01:10:25,425 --> 01:10:30,798
MATT: Yeah, with a two. I only have two bear right
now.

1025
01:10:30,798 --> 01:10:36,046
MARISHA: She goes, "You'll pay for this."

1026
01:10:36,046 --> 01:10:40,375
MATT: Take your wounded boy, and don't cross a
bear in a hat ever again.

1027
01:10:40,375 --> 01:10:48,155
MARISHA: She grabs Cow and starts trying to drag
him off. It's going to take time.

1028
01:10:48,155 --> 01:10:49,562
SAM: It's going to take a while.

1029
01:10:49,562 --> 01:10:52,822
MARISHA: It's pretty sad, actually.

1030
01:10:52,822 --> 01:10:54,359
BRIAN: Are there any sticks left?

1031
01:10:54,359 --> 01:10:58,796
MARISHA: Just the one stick. There is another
stick. It is just a stick, though.

1032
01:10:58,796 --> 01:11:01,468
SAM: I'm going to eat the second stick.

1033
01:11:01,468 --> 01:11:11,132
MARISHA: Okay. I'd say you get a point in bear for
that. You did some pretty good bear stuff this

1034
01:11:11,132 --> 01:11:12,371
go-round.

1035
01:11:12,371 --> 01:11:14,242
MATT: Do we also move a point into bear?

1036
01:11:14,242 --> 01:11:19,842
MARISHA: You would move a point into criminal, and
you would also move a point into criminal because

1037
01:11:19,842 --> 01:11:21,141
your plan succeeded.

1038
01:11:21,141 --> 01:11:23,423
MATT: For using a special skill. That's right.
That's not good.

1039
01:11:23,423 --> 01:11:28,199
TALIESIN: Say, Trinket. You've got a great singing
voice.

1040
01:11:28,199 --> 01:11:34,883
SAM: Boss, I know she's within earshot, but
shouldn't we leave no witnesses? Do you want me to

1041
01:11:34,883 --> 01:11:37,284
take her out of commission?

1042
01:11:37,284 --> 01:11:41,699
LIAM: She's a fucking cow. Do you think she's
going to go to the city council and report a bunch

1043
01:11:41,699 --> 01:11:46,145
of bears? We need to keep on the task at hand: get
the honey and get out.

1044
01:11:46,145 --> 01:11:51,563
MATT: As she turns away, I take a quick glance to
look at the back of her shoulderblades to see if I

1045
01:11:51,563 --> 01:11:53,857
notice any familiar branding.

1046
01:11:53,857 --> 01:12:04,346
MARISHA: You actually do recognize this branding.
This is from the old couple that Vox Machina saved

1047
01:12:04,346 --> 01:12:07,312
their bears from being eaten from rocs.

1048
01:12:07,312 --> 01:12:08,449
MATT and SAM: Their cows.

1049
01:12:08,449 --> 01:12:10,792
MARISHA: Their cows, yeah. What did I say?

1050
01:12:10,792 --> 01:12:11,792
SAM: You said bears.

1051
01:12:11,792 --> 01:12:14,288
MARISHA: Oh, sorry. Cows.

1052
01:12:14,288 --> 01:12:15,485
LIAM: We got it.

1053
01:12:15,485 --> 01:12:19,651
MARISHA: The same old couple that you saw earlier,
running through looking for their lost cows.

1054
01:12:19,651 --> 01:12:24,869
MATT: I turn to Peddy and say: wait, I know these
cows. We've talked to these cows. These cows are

1055
01:12:24,869 --> 01:12:26,240
assholes.

1056
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:28,238
SAM: You want me to show them what-for?

1057
01:12:28,238 --> 01:12:29,738
MATT: Finish them off.

1058
01:12:29,738 --> 01:12:33,163
SAM: All right! I'm going to go up and take my
stick and knock Bonnie in the head with it.

1059
01:12:33,163 --> 01:12:44,034
MARISHA: Okay, you use the stick, and as you rear
it back, it turns into a giant tree trunk,

1060
01:12:44,034 --> 01:12:48,970
basically, that comes toppling down right on her
head. Roll for criminal.

1061
01:12:48,970 --> 01:12:53,397
SAM: Oh, I've got to roll well. Two!

1062
01:12:53,397 --> 01:12:55,178
MARISHA: Wait, no. Bear.

1063
01:12:55,178 --> 01:12:56,506
SAM: Either way, I succeed.

1064
01:12:56,506 --> 01:13:01,237
MARISHA: Okay. (impact) A little blood
splatters--

1065
01:13:01,237 --> 01:13:02,336
SAM: She's dead?

1066
01:13:02,336 --> 01:13:09,086
MARISHA: She had a tree fall on her. And then
after a second, it goes back to a stick.

1067
01:13:09,086 --> 01:13:12,339
MATT: Okay, I thought it was a stick. That's on
me.

1068
01:13:12,339 --> 01:13:16,766
SAM: This is amazing! I've got a stick that makes
trees.

1069
01:13:16,766 --> 01:13:19,819
TALIESIN: Who would've thunk it.

1070
01:13:19,819 --> 01:13:21,926
LIAM: Trinket, I'm going to make a proposal to
you.

1071
01:13:21,926 --> 01:13:23,828
MATT: Does it involve honey? I'm starting to get real
twitchy.

1072
01:13:23,828 --> 01:13:24,667
SAM: Boss!

1073
01:13:24,667 --> 01:13:25,782
LIAM: Yeah?

1074
01:13:25,782 --> 01:13:28,902
SAM: Did you hear the part where this turns into
trees?!

1075
01:13:28,902 --> 01:13:32,884
LIAM: It doesn't make any sense. I'm doing
business, all right? Sit tight.

1076
01:13:32,884 --> 01:13:35,465
SAM: I feel like this is a more momentous thing!

1077
01:13:35,465 --> 01:13:39,930
LIAM: It doesn't seem that important in the grand
scheme of things.

1078
01:13:39,930 --> 01:13:42,766
BRIAN: Didn't it used to be a tree, anyway?

1079
01:13:42,766 --> 01:13:45,885
LIAM: Keep your mind on honey, all right, Peddy?

1080
01:13:45,885 --> 01:13:46,797
SAM: All right.

1081
01:13:46,797 --> 01:13:51,857
BRIAN: I know you're not used to holding things
that size in your hand, but you need to focus.

1082
01:13:51,857 --> 01:13:53,017
LIAM: Las Vegas.

1083
01:13:53,017 --> 01:13:54,076
BRIAN: Yo.

1084
01:13:54,076 --> 01:13:57,701
LIAM: You're the best at what you do, bud, but
hold on. The big bears are talking business.

1085
01:13:57,701 --> 01:13:58,872
BRIAN: All right.

1086
01:13:58,872 --> 01:14:05,656
LIAM: You seem like a hard motherfucker to me.
Once we get the honey, I get the sense that you've

1087
01:14:05,656 --> 01:14:08,214
got ties to these people.

1088
01:14:08,214 --> 01:14:10,143
MATT: More or less, yeah.

1089
01:14:10,143 --> 01:14:18,837
LIAM: What say you run free with us? We could hit
Vasselheim. We could get all the fucking honey of every

1090
01:14:18,837 --> 01:14:22,906
temple in that city. The good stuff, after this.

1091
01:14:22,906 --> 01:14:25,009
BRIAN: We've got a cart to pull it in, and
everything.

1092
01:14:25,009 --> 01:14:29,911
TALIESIN: The Slayer's Take's got to have fingers
in dozens of bakeries all over town. Their honey

1093
01:14:29,911 --> 01:14:33,662
pots are sweet.

1094
01:14:33,662 --> 01:14:40,582
MATT: Looking as how I'm five points into criminal
right now, I start nodding slowly, and go: all

1095
01:14:40,582 --> 01:14:47,595
right, I hear what you're saying. You all seem to
be a fairly functional lot. We'll see how this--

1096
01:14:47,595 --> 01:14:54,519
<i>most</i> of you seem like a functional lot. Let's
see how this goes down. When all's said and done

1097
01:14:54,519 --> 01:14:58,523
and we've enjoyed our just desserts, you might be
onto something.

1098
01:14:58,523 --> 01:15:01,192
LIAM: I like this guy, Waffle.

1099
01:15:01,192 --> 01:15:05,043
TALIESIN: Yeah, there was a honey pun. That's
good. Yeah.

1100
01:15:05,043 --> 01:15:15,194
MARISHA: You peek down the alleyway a little bit.
People are still pretty cleared out of the town

1101
01:15:15,194 --> 01:15:21,947
square from where everyone was looking for a giant
bear that's now running loose in the town. You see

1102
01:15:21,947 --> 01:15:31,126
a few knocked-over jars of the sample honey. It
would be risky, but there's some honey not too far.

1103
01:15:31,126 --> 01:15:37,298
MATT: That's worth the risk. I've got to keep my
eyes focused. My brain right now is caught up with

1104
01:15:37,298 --> 01:15:42,066
the ideas of all the various other heists we could
throw, and I've been a good person so far, a good

1105
01:15:42,066 --> 01:15:49,305
bear, in my life. I can't deter too far from that
path. I'll be right back. And I rush up to try and

1106
01:15:49,305 --> 01:15:51,306
grab one of the canisters and bring it back.

1107
01:15:51,306 --> 01:15:52,881
SAM: Why's he always leaving us like that?

1108
01:15:52,881 --> 01:15:54,045
MARISHA: Roll for criminal.

1109
01:15:54,045 --> 01:15:56,298
MATT: I make it.

1110
01:15:56,298 --> 01:16:00,433
MARISHA: You scoop up as many as you can.

1111
01:16:00,433 --> 01:16:02,285
MATT: I'm jamming it into my mouth directly.

1112
01:16:02,285 --> 01:16:16,791
MARISHA: Move a point from criminal to bear, and
I'd say you can probably bear-handle two more jars

1113
01:16:16,791 --> 01:16:18,592
of honey, awkwardly.

1114
01:16:18,592 --> 01:16:21,583
MATT: I come back and put it into the Radio Flyer.

1115
01:16:21,583 --> 01:16:24,999
BRIAN: Can I eat some of it as I help him?

1116
01:16:24,999 --> 01:16:28,290
MARISHA: Sure. Move a point. Does anyone else want to
eat anything? You good?

1117
01:16:28,290 --> 01:16:33,579
LIAM: I'm all right. I'm feeling pretty in
control, so let those in need scoop the honey first.

1118
01:16:33,579 --> 01:16:36,260
SAM: I'm more of a bamboo person, honestly. I
don't really-- I'm fine.

1119
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:37,680
MATT: Dip your spoon in it. Try it.

1120
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:52,947
SAM: Oh yeah, I have those sample spoons.
Delicate. Nice odor. Has a forward nose. Jammy,

1121
01:16:52,947 --> 01:16:54,797
but new-world jammy.

1122
01:16:54,797 --> 01:16:57,083
BRIAN: Jammy? I heard jimmy.

1123
01:16:57,083 --> 01:17:00,148
SAM: Yeah, it's got a steely-oaky feel.

1124
01:17:00,148 --> 01:17:02,196
TALIESIN: What are the notes, man?

1125
01:17:02,196 --> 01:17:03,973
BRIAN: How old would you say it is?

1126
01:17:03,973 --> 01:17:14,468
SAM: 12 years, aged in barrel. Good mouthfeel. I
like it! Hey, this stuff is pretty good. You know

1127
01:17:14,468 --> 01:17:17,391
what this is like? Liquid bamboo.

1128
01:17:17,391 --> 01:17:22,733
LIAM: You know how you can tell a panda bear is a
vegan? It never fucking stops telling you about it.

1129
01:17:22,733 --> 01:17:27,241
BRIAN: Yeah, and the ones that do Crossfit.

1130
01:17:27,241 --> 01:17:31,731
(laughter)

1131
01:17:31,731 --> 01:17:33,403
SAM: What's Crossfit?

1132
01:17:33,403 --> 01:17:37,521
BRIAN: It's when they run up and down the thing,
and they're always talking about the shirts.

1133
01:17:37,521 --> 01:17:41,033
LIAM: No, Vegas, we do Bee-90X.

1134
01:17:41,033 --> 01:17:43,465
BRIAN: Yeah, Bee-90X.

1135
01:17:43,465 --> 01:17:51,025
MATT: Focus! We've got honey hiding somewhere
right now. I don't want you buffoons ruining our

1136
01:17:51,025 --> 01:17:55,184
chance. They know there's bears around now, and I
bought us a little bit of time, but we've got to

1137
01:17:55,184 --> 01:17:56,255
hurry it up.

1138
01:17:56,255 --> 01:17:59,870
LIAM: He talks a lot of sense. Come on. We've got
to keep our eyes on the prize. We've got to get to

1139
01:17:59,870 --> 01:18:00,956
this inn.

1140
01:18:00,956 --> 01:18:02,610
MATT: All right. You've got the nose, you've got
the brains.

1141
01:18:02,610 --> 01:18:04,507
LIAM: You got a scent on it, Waffle?

1142
01:18:04,507 --> 01:18:06,036
TALIESIN: Do I still got a scent on it?

1143
01:18:06,036 --> 01:18:08,402
MARISHA: Yeah, I'd say you've still got a pretty
good scent on it.

1144
01:18:08,402 --> 01:18:14,477
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's this way. Bring the cart
around!

1145
01:18:14,477 --> 01:18:23,430
BRIAN: (squeaking wheels)

1146
01:18:23,430 --> 01:18:31,667
MARISHA: You hear a few guards in the distance,
shouting. It's kind of inaudible. "Clear!" Seems

1147
01:18:31,711 --> 01:18:34,027
people are definitely looking.

1148
01:18:34,027 --> 01:18:36,198
LIAM: Snake? Snake!

1149
01:18:36,198 --> 01:18:46,417
MARISAH: You've definitely put the city on high
alert, for sure. Everyone roll a criminal check as

1150
01:18:46,417 --> 01:18:48,827
you stealthily move through the city.

1151
01:18:48,827 --> 01:18:50,782
SAM: Succeed.

1152
01:18:50,782 --> 01:18:52,402
MATT and BRIAN: Succeed.

1153
01:18:52,402 --> 01:18:55,696
LIAM: I failed big time. I rolled a six.

1154
01:18:55,696 --> 01:18:57,505
MARISHA: All right. What about you, Waffle?

1155
01:18:57,505 --> 01:19:00,280
TALIESIN: I was going to roll, but first, I was
going to think about the last time we were in a

1156
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:01,990
tricky situation like this.

1157
01:19:01,990 --> 01:19:04,623
BRIAN: Ugh, here comes one of grandpa's old
stories.

1158
01:19:04,623 --> 01:19:10,752
TALIESIN: No, I remember we were doing a roll
through Whitestone. There was high alert.

1159
01:19:10,752 --> 01:19:13,437
MARISHA: Flashback! (flashback noises)

1160
01:19:13,437 --> 01:19:17,915
TALIESIN: We were trying to book our way through
the main square towards that big tree.

1161
01:19:17,915 --> 01:19:19,112
LIAM: Goddamn tree.

1162
01:19:19,112 --> 01:19:23,730
TALIESIN: The tree can give you a little coverage,
but not nearly enough. That cart came by, and we kept

1163
01:19:23,730 --> 01:19:29,271
walking right behind the horses on the cart. No
one suspected a thing. They were sitting there,

1164
01:19:29,271 --> 01:19:34,758
minding their own business, making noise like,
"Bears! Look out, bears!" They didn't see a damn

1165
01:19:34,758 --> 01:19:36,106
thing coming.

1166
01:19:36,106 --> 01:19:39,474
LIAM: Farted the whole way there. Smokescreen.
Done. Out. Honey got.

1167
01:19:39,474 --> 01:19:43,400
TALIESIN: Ba-da-bing. Can I get a point of
criminal?

1168
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:45,187
MARISHA: You can get a point in criminal back.

1169
01:19:45,187 --> 01:19:47,125
LIAM: Does that save all of us, or just him?

1170
01:19:47,125 --> 01:19:53,777
MARISHA: Just him. I'd say, if you want to switch
a point, since you were part of that, go ahead.

1171
01:19:53,777 --> 01:19:55,107
LIAM: So it goes...

1172
01:19:55,107 --> 01:19:58,090
MARISHA: From bear to criminal.

1173
01:19:58,090 --> 01:20:03,405
TALIESIN: Flashback, you go bear to criminal.
Honey: criminal to bear. Don't know why I'm

1174
01:20:03,405 --> 01:20:04,794
still-- boy.

1175
01:20:04,794 --> 01:20:12,673
MARISHA: And it actually gives you a pretty good
idea, Waffle. Since the town is kind of empty

1176
01:20:12,673 --> 01:20:18,936
right now, you walk by a little news stand that
has tobacco and hand-rolled cigarettes.

1177
01:20:18,936 --> 01:20:28,668
TALIESIN: Sweet syrup, I got me an idea. Hold on. I
walk up. Just trying.

1178
01:20:28,668 --> 01:20:31,347
MARISHA: Okay.

1179
01:20:31,347 --> 01:20:37,811
TALIESIN: Pull a cigar together, basically. Trying
to stealthily grab a couple cigars.

1180
01:20:37,811 --> 01:20:43,591
MARISHA: Okay. I'll allow it to just happen. Just
because of the ridiculousness.

1181
01:20:43,591 --> 01:20:46,971
TALIESIN: I'm going to light a couple.

1182
01:20:46,971 --> 01:20:50,362
MATT: I go to get the fire staff from the ground,
pull it back, pull my cloak back up.

1183
01:20:50,362 --> 01:20:53,756
MARISHA: It's an obnoxiously large flame for what
you're trying to do, but--

1184
01:20:53,756 --> 01:20:56,916
TALIESIN: That's fine. It's fine. Now--

1185
01:20:56,916 --> 01:21:02,396
LIAM: Last time you did this, you got stoned for
three days on the outskirts of Kraghammer. I had

1186
01:21:02,396 --> 01:21:05,447
to talk you out of that tree. Took me three
fucking days!

1187
01:21:05,447 --> 01:21:06,828
TALIESIN: But it worked, didn't it?

1188
01:21:06,828 --> 01:21:08,361
LIAM: Do you have yourself in control?

1189
01:21:08,421 --> 01:21:10,326
TALIESIN: I'm fine. Right now I feel (grunts).

1190
01:21:10,326 --> 01:21:11,865
LIAM: Moderation. Moderation.

1191
01:21:11,865 --> 01:21:16,786
TALIESIN: Feeling good. Feeling fine. So... now?

1192
01:21:16,786 --> 01:21:25,266
MARISHA: Go ahead and put another point into
criminal from bear. It's pretty good. It feels

1193
01:21:25,266 --> 01:21:26,398
pretty good.

1194
01:21:26,398 --> 01:21:28,703
TALIESIN: Yeah. No, smoking. Honey blazed.

1195
01:21:28,703 --> 01:21:37,434
MARISHA: You guys keep moving, doing pretty good.
As you come around a corner, down an alleyway, you

1196
01:21:37,434 --> 01:21:47,178
see a little kerfuffle going on and you see two
bigger kids just sucker-punching on this little

1197
01:21:47,178 --> 01:21:52,530
kid and they're taking honey samples and smearing
it in his hand. A lot of it, it's Victor just

1198
01:21:52,530 --> 01:21:59,075
smearing it into his hair. You hear the kid
screaming, "Hey! Hey! Stop it! Stop it, you guys!

1199
01:21:59,075 --> 01:22:02,533
"Seriously, my dad's going to kick your butt!"

1200
01:22:02,533 --> 01:22:06,950
BRIAN: I run over there and smack one of the kids
in the back of the head.

1201
01:22:06,950 --> 01:22:10,354
MARISHA: He was like, (sneering) "Ah!" Turns
around.

1202
01:22:10,354 --> 01:22:12,217
BRIAN: Stop it!

1203
01:22:12,217 --> 01:22:19,043
MARISHA: "Shit, you guys! Hey Jordan. Jordan, look,
it's a ferret! Let's capture him!"

1204
01:22:19,043 --> 01:22:21,385
BRIAN: I'm not a ferret, you piece of shit! Get
away from him!

1205
01:22:21,385 --> 01:22:23,397
MARISHA: The kids start trying to capture you.

1206
01:22:23,397 --> 01:22:25,470
BRIAN: Oh, that's fine. I just start fucking--

1207
01:22:25,470 --> 01:22:26,854
SAM: Killing?

1208
01:22:26,854 --> 01:22:28,082
MARISHA: Roll for carnage.

1209
01:22:28,082 --> 01:22:29,057
BRIAN: Carnage.

1210
01:22:29,057 --> 01:22:30,932
LIAM: I'm going to run out and help him. I'm going
to jump the other kid.

1211
01:22:30,932 --> 01:22:35,145
BRIAN: (shouting) I don't like bullies! It's a
four.

1212
01:22:35,145 --> 01:22:36,518
MATT: Oh, you have advantage because it's
carnage.

1213
01:22:36,518 --> 01:22:38,612
BRIAN: Yeah, then you have advantage.

1214
01:22:38,612 --> 01:22:41,068
MARISHA: Go ahead, roll for bear plus one.

1215
01:22:41,068 --> 01:22:44,933
BRIAN: I fail. Does that mean I fail? Yeah.

1216
01:22:44,933 --> 01:22:46,509
LIAM: I failed hard.

1217
01:22:46,509 --> 01:22:48,169
MARISHA: Oh shit.

1218
01:22:48,169 --> 01:22:49,249
BRIAN: We both failed.

1219
01:22:49,249 --> 01:22:50,541
LIAM: Son of a bitch!

1220
01:22:50,541 --> 01:22:57,163
MARISHA: (laughs) The kid grabs you successfully.
The other kid turns, sees you. He's like, "Oh

1221
01:22:57,163 --> 01:23:02,956
"shit! Shit, Jordan, it's those bears!" And starts
taking the wooden play sword that he got at the

1222
01:23:02,956 --> 01:23:06,613
festival and just starts beating you with it.

1223
01:23:06,613 --> 01:23:09,275
TALIESIN: I'm going to hack that sword in half! I'm
going to come running up and hack that sword in half.

1224
01:23:09,275 --> 01:23:13,002
MARISHA: Take a point in bear. Also take a point
in bear. As the kid's holding you and you're just

1225
01:23:13,002 --> 01:23:15,327
(struggling sounds).

1226
01:23:15,327 --> 01:23:19,698
MATT: I just sit back and watch with Peddy,
smoking the cigarette that Waffle gave me.

1227
01:23:19,698 --> 01:23:21,278
TALIESIN: I'm going to hack that sword in half.

1228
01:23:21,278 --> 01:23:23,059
BRIAN: This is not how it went in the after school
special.

1229
01:23:23,059 --> 01:23:24,593
MARISHA: How are you going to hack that sword?

1230
01:23:24,593 --> 01:23:27,474
TALIESIN: With my claws. I'm going to hack it in
half.

1231
01:23:27,474 --> 01:23:30,515
MARISHA: You're really pushing that hacker thing,
aren't you?

1232
01:23:30,515 --> 01:23:32,924
TALIESIN: That's what you gave me, man!

1233
01:23:32,924 --> 01:23:36,863
MARISHA: You know, once again, I'll allow it based
on the shitty English language.

1234
01:23:36,863 --> 01:23:40,948
TALIESIN: Thank you. That's how I get away with
almost everything in my life.

1235
01:23:40,948 --> 01:23:42,730
MARISHA: Two dice, under bear.

1236
01:23:42,730 --> 01:23:47,170
TALIESIN: Two dice, under bear. I do it! I hack
the sword.

1237
01:23:47,170 --> 01:23:53,412
MARISHA: Okay. The sword breaks in half. He's
like, "Oh, shit, it's the other bear!"

1238
01:23:53,412 --> 01:23:55,394
TALIESIN: You've been hacked.

1239
01:23:55,394 --> 01:23:56,729
MARISHA: "What? I feel like--"

1240
01:23:56,729 --> 01:24:00,488
TALIESIN: Say it! Say you've been hacked! I hacked
you! Say it!

1241
01:24:00,488 --> 01:24:03,018
MARISHA: "George, what's he trying to say?"

1242
01:24:03,018 --> 01:24:05,069
TALIESIN: (bear sounds)

1243
01:24:05,069 --> 01:24:06,671
MARISHA: As he's distracted--

1244
01:24:06,671 --> 01:24:09,216
LIAM: Do I have a kid on my back, by the way?

1245
01:24:09,216 --> 01:24:16,772
MARISHA: Oh, the other kid that was being bullied
comes up with his prop sword and he goes (whack)

1246
01:24:16,772 --> 01:24:22,350
and comes down right over the top of the first kid
who is holding you. He turns to the second kid.

1247
01:24:22,350 --> 01:24:28,409
They're like, "Aw, shit, man. Come on, let's get
out of here!" And they take off.

1248
01:24:28,409 --> 01:24:30,218
LIAM: I trip one of them as they run.

1249
01:24:30,218 --> 01:24:35,094
MARISHA: "Ugh! You just scraped my knee!"
(crying)

1250
01:24:35,094 --> 01:24:39,158
LIAM: Run, you stubborn prick, you! (manic laughter)

1251
01:24:39,158 --> 01:24:40,509
MARISHA: "Mum!"

1252
01:24:40,509 --> 01:24:44,184
SAM: We're dicks.

1253
01:24:44,184 --> 01:24:48,336
MARISHA: As you flick the cigarette, you see one
of Victor's sample cups go--

1254
01:24:48,336 --> 01:24:49,266
MATT: No!

1255
01:24:49,266 --> 01:24:53,241
MARISHA: --(ignition sounds). It goes (sparking
sound), like a bottle rocket.

1256
01:24:53,241 --> 01:24:59,249
MATT: Right. Point of order. No one flick
cigarettes. Especially if there are kids with it smeared in

1257
01:24:59,249 --> 01:25:05,586
their hair. I'm so sorry. Which, the kid sees a
giant hat-wearing Trinket going (bear sounds).

1258
01:25:05,592 --> 01:25:09,463
MARISHA: He's got this cowlick-- he's sore and
he's like--

1259
01:25:09,463 --> 01:25:12,550
MATT: I hold the torch away.

1260
01:25:12,550 --> 01:25:17,347
MARISHA: "Wow. You know, I really feel like you
guys are trying to talk to me. This is great! You

1261
01:25:17,347 --> 01:25:23,130
"guys saved me! Oh, I got saved by bears! No one's
going to believe me."

1262
01:25:23,130 --> 01:25:26,085
MATT: (grunts)

1263
01:25:26,085 --> 01:25:30,392
MARISHA: "That's right, fuzzy bear. Hey, are you
guys-- you guys want some honey?"

1264
01:25:30,392 --> 01:25:31,385
BRIAN: Yes?

1265
01:25:31,385 --> 01:25:32,638
MARISHA: "I know where there's a lot of honey."

1266
01:25:32,638 --> 01:25:34,180
TALIESIN: That's the only word of English I know.

1267
01:25:34,180 --> 01:25:35,115
BRIAN: Tell us.

1268
01:25:35,115 --> 01:25:38,494
MARISHA: "Okay. See, my dad is the head of
security."

1269
01:25:38,494 --> 01:25:40,959
BRIAN: Congrats.

1270
01:25:40,959 --> 01:25:48,797
MARISHA: "He's the head of-- so he knows where all
the honey is hiding and he told me that there's a

1271
01:25:48,797 --> 01:25:56,564
"code and he made me collect a bunch of fish for it
and it wasn't very fun. But there's a secret code!

1272
01:25:56,564 --> 01:26:00,304
"I can tell it. I can show you where my dad is!"

1273
01:26:00,304 --> 01:26:10,638
LIAM: Kid, how would you like to be an official
bear bandit? (bear sounds)

1274
01:26:10,638 --> 01:26:18,168
MARISHA: "It's so cool having bear friends! Okay,
if you go around the corner and go up there, right

1275
01:26:18,168 --> 01:26:26,892
"next to the Sun Kissed Inn. My mum likes drinking
there a lot. If you go over, next to the Sun Kissed

1276
01:26:26,892 --> 01:26:32,629
"Inn, there's an alley behind it and there's a
door that goes up to the side, and that's where

1277
01:26:32,629 --> 01:26:36,033
"the head of security is."

1278
01:26:36,033 --> 01:26:40,040
LIAM: This kid. I like this kid.

1279
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:41,745
SAM: Boss, you know--

1280
01:26:41,745 --> 01:26:45,190
MARISHA: "Okay. Have fun. Bye!" And he runs off.

1281
01:26:45,190 --> 01:26:47,235
MATT: Kid, wash your hair!

1282
01:26:47,235 --> 01:26:51,015
MARISHA: (giggling) "Mum!" And he runs off.

1283
01:26:51,015 --> 01:26:53,498
SAM: Do you want to rub him out? No witnesses,
right?

1284
01:26:53,498 --> 01:26:56,222
LIAM: No, you had your fun for the day, all
right?

1285
01:26:56,222 --> 01:27:00,889
BRIAN: Did you say rub him out? I have to say no.

1286
01:27:00,889 --> 01:27:02,998
TALIESIN: It got weird.

1287
01:27:02,998 --> 01:27:04,386
SAM: Vegas.

1288
01:27:04,386 --> 01:27:06,809
LIAM: I remember this one time in Las Vegas...

1289
01:27:06,809 --> 01:27:08,365
SAM: Oh, are you doing a flashback right now?

1290
01:27:08,365 --> 01:27:10,322
(laughter)

1291
01:27:10,322 --> 01:27:11,820
TALIESIN: No.

1292
01:27:11,820 --> 01:27:16,425
LIAM: All right. You got the smell of honey in
your nose, and we're going to the Sunkist Inn. We know

1293
01:27:16,425 --> 01:27:23,186
the head of security is up a side stairway.
What the fuck do we do with that?

1294
01:27:23,243 --> 01:27:24,651
TALIESIN: I don't know. You're the brains.

1295
01:27:24,651 --> 01:27:27,503
BRIAN: I don't think we can take the cart up the
stairs.

1296
01:27:27,588 --> 01:27:29,642
MATT: I think we can with the right muscle.

1297
01:27:29,642 --> 01:27:32,413
BRIAN: Oh. Yeah.

1298
01:27:32,413 --> 01:27:33,963
SAM: I can carry a cart.

1299
01:27:33,963 --> 01:27:35,762
BRIAN: A cart full of honey?

1300
01:27:35,762 --> 01:27:37,250
SAM: Sure. Yeah.

1301
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:40,804
BRIAN: Could you carry me too, like the old days?

1302
01:27:40,804 --> 01:27:42,894
SAM: Why would I-- what?

1303
01:27:42,894 --> 01:27:46,754
BRIAN: Remember when I was hiding behind you in
the beginning?

1304
01:27:46,794 --> 01:27:47,625
SAM: Yeah.

1305
01:27:47,625 --> 01:27:49,118
TALIESIN: (flashback sounds)

1306
01:27:49,118 --> 01:27:50,485
(laughter)

1307
01:27:50,485 --> 01:27:52,705
TALIESIN: Everyone go back to eight minutes 
into the video.

1308
01:27:52,705 --> 01:27:57,068
SAM: Are we going to do a flashback to that
moment?

1309
01:27:57,068 --> 01:27:59,066
MARISHA: If you would like to.

1310
01:27:59,066 --> 01:28:00,382
BRIAN: Yeah!

1311
01:28:00,382 --> 01:28:05,020
SAM: Yeah. There's another guy. There's another
guy here. You said three bears but there's another

1312
01:28:05,020 --> 01:28:08,486
guy. Why don't you come out from behind me there,
friend?

1313
01:28:08,486 --> 01:28:12,070
BRIAN: Hey, it's me! I don't remember what I said.

1314
01:28:12,070 --> 01:28:16,385
MARISHA: Flashback. (flashback sounds) And you're
back.

1315
01:28:16,385 --> 01:28:20,305
TALIESIN: Someday we're all going to look 
back on this and laugh, right there.

1316
01:28:20,305 --> 01:28:22,676
MARISHA: Go ahead and put a point from bear into
criminal.

1317
01:28:22,676 --> 01:28:26,350
SAM: I think you did that wrong, friend. No, it's
bear to criminal.

1318
01:28:26,350 --> 01:28:29,723
BRIAN: I was hoping it was gonna take a thing--

1319
01:28:29,723 --> 01:28:32,011
MARISHA: Well, you can always eat the honey.

1320
01:28:32,011 --> 01:28:33,621
BRIAN: Oh yeah.

1321
01:28:33,621 --> 01:28:36,258
MARISHA: And then you also take a point from bear into
criminal.

1322
01:28:36,258 --> 01:28:37,899
BRIAN: I'll eat some more honey too.

1323
01:28:37,899 --> 01:28:40,500
MARISHA: Okay. Now you can move that point
back.

1324
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:42,701
MATT: How many more servings of honey do we have
in the cart?

1325
01:28:42,701 --> 01:28:45,484
MARISHA: You've got a jar and a half.

1326
01:28:45,484 --> 01:28:47,467
TALIESIN: Are they eating the hat honey?

1327
01:28:47,508 --> 01:28:49,943
MATT: Is it a half a jar per serving?

1328
01:28:49,943 --> 01:28:51,266
MARISHA: I'd say yeah, three more.

1329
01:28:51,266 --> 01:28:52,423
TALIESIN: Don't eat the hat honey.

1330
01:28:52,423 --> 01:28:56,300
MATT: All right, don't eat the hat honey. We only
got three proper servings left so we have to be

1331
01:28:56,300 --> 01:28:57,161
sparing.

1332
01:28:57,161 --> 01:28:59,960
LIAM: How close are we to this tavern?

1333
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:01,446
BRIAN: Well, we're going to go get a fuckton more.

1334
01:29:01,446 --> 01:29:03,776
LIAM: Waffle, what does your nose tell you?

1335
01:29:03,776 --> 01:29:10,375
TALIESIN: (sniffs) I don't know. I have no real
perception of distance that is actually capable of

1336
01:29:10,375 --> 01:29:12,265
being communicated to a bunch of other bears.

1337
01:29:12,265 --> 01:29:13,450
MARISHA: It's close.

1338
01:29:13,450 --> 01:29:15,280
LIAM: Is it like three glens or five?

1339
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:16,687
TALIESIN: It's close. No, it's like two glens
tops.

1340
01:29:16,687 --> 01:29:17,576
LIAM: Two glens over?

1341
01:29:17,576 --> 01:29:18,513
TALIESIN: It's close.

1342
01:29:18,513 --> 01:29:19,737
MARISHA: That sounds accurate.

1343
01:29:19,737 --> 01:29:22,261
TALIESIN: A glen. Maybe half a hill and a dale.

1344
01:29:22,261 --> 01:29:28,354
LIAM: Okay. Well, let's get close. I want your
nose and my nose. I have a pretty good nose. The

1345
01:29:28,354 --> 01:29:32,598
best noses. You'd be surprised! We get outside
that tavern and try to figure out where in that

1346
01:29:32,598 --> 01:29:35,356
building that honey is, it's probably in the
tavern, probably in the basement of the

1347
01:29:35,356 --> 01:29:40,350
tavern, probably in the back in the larder-- but
let's check it out. Come on.

1348
01:29:40,350 --> 01:29:51,143
MARISHA: And with that, we will take a break. As
always, stay tuned for the wonderful Brian

1349
01:29:51,143 --> 01:29:57,644
Foster's codeword so you can win some shit. I
don't know what you're going to win, but you're

1350
01:29:57,644 --> 01:29:59,187
going to win some shit.

1351
01:29:59,187 --> 01:30:01,510
BRIAN: It's going to be a beautiful deck box.

1352
01:30:01,510 --> 01:30:04,124
MARISHA: And we're going to take a break and we'll
be right back, I guess.

1353
01:30:04,124 --> 01:30:05,633
SAM: Woo-hoo! Marisha Ray!

1354
01:30:05,633 --> 01:30:08,985
(cheers and applause)

1355
01:30:08,985 --> 01:48:28,213
[break]

1356
01:48:28,272 --> 01:48:43,242
MARISHA: Welcome back... to Trinket and Peddy
Tuxpin's Honey Heist. We have a winner for Brian's

1357
01:48:43,242 --> 01:48:45,803
wood, which is HawkWinter01.

1358
01:48:45,803 --> 01:48:48,327
MATT and MARISHA: HawkWinter!

1359
01:48:48,327 --> 01:48:49,858
BRIAN: Sounds like a born winner.

1360
01:48:49,858 --> 01:48:52,632
MARISHA: Yeah. Sounds like a Marvel character.

1361
01:48:52,632 --> 01:48:54,089
MATT: We drink to your honor.

1362
01:48:54,089 --> 01:49:04,368
MARISHA: Sponsored by Marvel Puzzle Quest. Got to
catch them all. And then you, Sam, quick catch-up

1363
01:49:04,368 --> 01:49:05,394
announcement?

1364
01:49:05,394 --> 01:49:13,058
SAM: Yeah, so next week, I will be hosting a
one-shot. I will be in the Marisha seat, and my

1365
01:49:13,058 --> 01:49:23,394
special guests will be: Amy Vorpahl, from Geek &
Sundry. Stefanie aka Sofia Woodburn. Yuri

1366
01:49:23,394 --> 01:49:32,404
Lowenthal, voice of things. Noelle Stevenson,
writer of things. Molly Ostertag-- I hope I'm

1367
01:49:32,404 --> 01:49:39,990
saying that right-- also writer of things. And
back for more: Jon Heder! They will be having fun

1368
01:49:39,990 --> 01:49:43,104
adventures and fairytale romance on the high
seas.

1369
01:49:43,104 --> 01:49:45,942
MATT: I'm so excited.

1370
01:49:45,942 --> 01:49:50,413
TALIESIN: I am genuinely so pleased that all of
this is happening.

1371
01:49:50,475 --> 01:49:53,992
ALL: Be pleased.

1372
01:49:53,992 --> 01:49:57,853
TALIESIN: Yeah, and if you've got time tomorrow
night, we got the confirm that we're going to be singing

1373
01:49:57,853 --> 01:50:02,709
and drinking on Gather Your Party tomorrow night,
so we're going to be having a pub sing. You get to

1374
01:50:02,709 --> 01:50:03,881
hear me sing.

1375
01:50:03,881 --> 01:50:09,621
MATT: Forgot to mention One Night Only on
Saturday. We're doing GM Tips. Me and Satine are

1376
01:50:09,621 --> 01:50:12,874
hosting a GM Tips One Night Only, this Saturday at
8PM, I believe.

1377
01:50:12,874 --> 01:50:18,218
MARISHA: We've got some pretty awesome people who
are going to be on it.

1378
01:50:18,218 --> 01:50:22,435
BRIAN: I told Satine. She's on board.

1379
01:50:22,435 --> 01:50:26,722
LIAM: Some bad breaking news. This just in: Laura
and Travis actually tripped and fell into a giant

1380
01:50:26,722 --> 01:50:29,534
vat of Tim Tams in Australia and were smothered to
death.

1381
01:50:29,534 --> 01:50:32,345
SAM: Oh no. They tried to get out, but Vegemite
was poured on top.

1382
01:50:32,345 --> 01:50:34,571
MATT: They have to slam their way out of there.
It's the only way to do it.

1383
01:50:34,571 --> 01:50:36,253
LIAM: There was no coffee nearby.

1384
01:50:36,253 --> 01:50:43,259
BRIAN: It looks like Travis went mud-wrestling
again, but unfortunately, that's not mud.

1385
01:50:43,259 --> 01:50:48,918
MARISHA: You can donate to Oxfam to help them out.
No.

1386
01:50:48,918 --> 01:50:52,274
MATT: So?

1387
01:50:52,274 --> 01:50:58,252
MARISHA: All right. Criminal bear posse.

1388
01:50:58,252 --> 01:51:01,148
SAM: We're right back in it.

1389
01:51:01,148 --> 01:51:02,494
MARISHA: You're right back in.

1390
01:51:02,494 --> 01:51:03,772
TALIESIN: Our cloaks, our hats...

1391
01:51:03,772 --> 01:51:06,270
MARISHA: Your cloaks, your ascots, your hats.

1392
01:51:06,270 --> 01:51:08,197
LIAM: Our miniature Superman capes.

1393
01:51:08,197 --> 01:51:11,284
MARISHA: Your pull-behind de Rolo Roller.

1394
01:51:11,284 --> 01:51:19,573
MATT: Taking inventory here. Three sources of
honey, an explosive honey hat.

1395
01:51:19,573 --> 01:51:21,531
TALIESIN: A fez of explosive honey.

1396
01:51:21,531 --> 01:51:23,913
MATT: And a fire staff and a tree stick.

1397
01:51:23,913 --> 01:51:26,448
MARISHA: Not doing too bad.

1398
01:51:26,448 --> 01:51:27,663
MATT: Not a bad haul.

1399
01:51:27,663 --> 01:51:28,919
BRIAN: A cart!

1400
01:51:28,919 --> 01:51:30,033
MARISHA: And a cart.

1401
01:51:30,033 --> 01:51:33,570
LIAM: This could be yours, Trinket, forever and
ever and always.

1402
01:51:33,570 --> 01:51:37,349
MATT: I'm thinking about it, but still. You've
proved to me that you're useful, and you've proved

1403
01:51:37,349 --> 01:51:42,834
to me that you're partner material. Come on,
brains. Lead us to this tavern. Follow your

1404
01:51:42,834 --> 01:51:47,810
brother there. See if you can get us inside this
security door.

1405
01:51:47,810 --> 01:51:51,526
BRIAN: (wheels squeaking)

1406
01:51:51,526 --> 01:51:55,387
(laughter)

1407
01:51:55,387 --> 01:51:58,875
LIAM: Hold up. I take a whiz on the wheels to
silence them.

1408
01:51:58,875 --> 01:52:00,790
MARISHA: Roll for bear?

1409
01:52:00,790 --> 01:52:04,471
(laughter)

1410
01:52:04,471 --> 01:52:05,938
LIAM: I do it!

1411
01:52:05,938 --> 01:52:07,985
MARISHA: You successfully pee on wheels.

1412
01:52:07,985 --> 01:52:09,170
LIAM: Yeah.

1413
01:52:09,170 --> 01:52:14,597
BRIAN: I move the cart to change the wheels so he
can keep a steady stream going.

1414
01:52:14,597 --> 01:52:16,368
LIAM: How's it sound now?

1415
01:52:16,368 --> 01:52:24,504
MARISHA: Much better. You are leaving a bit of
tracks, but it dries in a while. It's good.

1416
01:52:24,504 --> 01:52:26,537
LIAM: The people do that here.

1417
01:52:26,537 --> 01:52:28,453
MATT: Yeah, it's Westruun. It smells like piss
everywhere.

1418
01:52:28,453 --> 01:52:35,836
MARISHA: All right, you guys keep moving, ducking
down alleyways, turning and looking like bears and

1419
01:52:35,836 --> 01:52:45,655
people as you need to. At one point, in the
distance, you hear: "Oh no! We found the Jamesons'

1420
01:52:45,655 --> 01:52:59,097
"lost cows. Hey, can we get a really big wagon?"
That happens in the background. It has people

1421
01:52:59,097 --> 01:53:05,006
distracted for a little bit, it seems. You keep
moving. As you come around the corner, you

1422
01:53:05,006 --> 01:53:10,075
see, across one of the main thoroughfares, the Sun
Kissed Inn.

1423
01:53:10,075 --> 01:53:12,685
BRIAN: That looks familiar.

1424
01:53:12,685 --> 01:53:21,296
MATT: I can't read, but it looks like an inn.
Sun's out. Feeling pretty kissy.

1425
01:53:21,296 --> 01:53:25,203
MARISHA: Looks pretty fancy. Looks nice. You're in
the Opal Ward right now.

1426
01:53:25,203 --> 01:53:27,739
LIAM: Is there a picture of the sun on the sign?

1427
01:53:27,739 --> 01:53:33,339
MARISHA: It's got a nice glow coming up over the
logo.

1428
01:53:33,339 --> 01:53:34,849
LIAM: This is it.

1429
01:53:34,849 --> 01:53:37,887
SAM: Let's go get us some honey. I'm going to go
right through the front door.

1430
01:53:37,887 --> 01:53:39,877
LIAM and TALIESIN: Whoa!

1431
01:53:39,877 --> 01:53:43,272
SAM: What? This is where the honey is, right? Come
on!

1432
01:53:43,272 --> 01:53:46,199
BRIAN: Yeah, but you can't just waltz right in.
She said we've got to go see the head.

1433
01:53:46,199 --> 01:53:47,498
SAM: Who's she?

1434
01:53:47,498 --> 01:53:53,044
LIAM: Peddy. Peddy, I love you, but this is not
your natural environment, even. You're not even a

1435
01:53:53,044 --> 01:53:54,613
bear that's from these parts.

1436
01:53:54,613 --> 01:54:02,086
SAM: All right, I know. I'm from out of town, all
right? Don't make me feel like-- fine.

1437
01:54:02,086 --> 01:54:05,939
LIAM: You're the strongest bear in the group. We
love you. We need you. But come on, let's take it

1438
01:54:05,939 --> 01:54:08,155
one bear paw at a time, all right?

1439
01:54:08,155 --> 01:54:11,312
TALIESIN: One. Just one. I know you've got four.
Just one.

1440
01:54:11,312 --> 01:54:15,650
LIAM: Listen, when we need you to crush somebody's
skulls, who are we going to ask? This guy? No.

1441
01:54:15,650 --> 01:54:18,244
You! Only you.

1442
01:54:18,244 --> 01:54:21,606
MATT: Actually, he's pretty much already almost 
killed one creature, but I get what your point is.

1443
01:54:21,606 --> 01:54:25,439
BRIAN: Cows do not like me. They do not like me.

1444
01:54:25,439 --> 01:54:28,387
TALIESIN: You apparently don't like them.

1445
01:54:28,387 --> 01:54:30,905
BRIAN: When someone calls me a ferret...

1446
01:54:30,905 --> 01:54:35,709
LIAM: We don't insult your integrity. What are we,
animals?

1447
01:54:35,709 --> 01:54:38,651
SAM: What are you, though, seriously? Are you a
mongoose or something?

1448
01:54:38,651 --> 01:54:43,377
BRIAN: No, I'm not a mongoose. Do I have gills? Do
I look like I have gills? I'm not a mongoose.

1449
01:54:43,377 --> 01:54:45,013
SAM: You're right. I should have seen: no gills.

1450
01:54:45,013 --> 01:54:46,503
BRIAN: I'm a honey badger!

1451
01:54:46,503 --> 01:54:47,826
MATT: It's a valid point.

1452
01:54:47,826 --> 01:54:52,991
BRIAN: I'm a honey badger. I'm a little bit
smaller. I wish I was a little bit taller.

1453
01:54:52,991 --> 01:54:55,424
(off-screen laugh)

1454
01:54:55,424 --> 01:54:58,511
(laughter)

1455
01:54:58,511 --> 01:55:03,031
SAM: That's your audience. One person.

1456
01:55:03,116 --> 01:55:12,002
LIAM: All right, cool your jets, Johnny Cash.
Let's case this joint, okay? Waffle! Where's the

1457
01:55:12,002 --> 01:55:13,840
honey smell coming from in this place?

1458
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:17,687
TALIESIN: (sniffs) I'm trying to pinpoint the
location of the honey.

1459
01:55:17,687 --> 01:55:23,729
MARISHA: You're getting some pretty strong wafts
right through the front door of the Sun Kissed

1460
01:55:23,729 --> 01:55:25,694
Tavern, for sure.

1461
01:55:25,694 --> 01:55:27,886
TALIESIN: I think we've come to the right place.

1462
01:55:27,886 --> 01:55:29,805
SAM: Hey, Waffle?

1463
01:55:29,805 --> 01:55:30,782
TALIESIN: Yeah?

1464
01:55:30,782 --> 01:55:35,208
SAM: There's an exposed pipe here. Maybe you
should sniff right there. You know, hack into the

1465
01:55:35,208 --> 01:55:36,240
mainframe?

1466
01:55:36,240 --> 01:55:40,618
TALIESIN: Don't tell me how to do my business.

1467
01:55:40,618 --> 01:55:41,832
SAM: Sorry.

1468
01:55:41,832 --> 01:55:44,836
TALIESIN: Can I hack the mainframe?

1469
01:55:44,836 --> 01:55:49,560
(laughter)

1470
01:55:49,560 --> 01:55:51,502
BRIAN: Don't tell me how to do what I was just
about to do.

1471
01:55:51,502 --> 01:55:58,260
MARISHA: Yeah. Roll for hacker. Roll for criminal.
It's under criminal.

1472
01:55:58,260 --> 01:56:01,427
LIAM: The last five years of video games have
prepared me for this moment.

1473
01:56:01,427 --> 01:56:02,751
TALIESIN: I do it.

1474
01:56:02,751 --> 01:56:10,770
MARISHA: All right. You get a good sniff, a good
waft. It's a little musty.

1475
01:56:10,770 --> 01:56:12,392
SAM: You're huffing it?

1476
01:56:12,392 --> 01:56:14,748
TALIESIN: No, my whole face is in the
pipe!

1477
01:56:14,748 --> 01:56:26,127
MARISHA: A little bit of fresh laundry, dryer sheets.
You go over and see rat droppings down one side.

1478
01:56:26,127 --> 01:56:30,780
SAM: He can see through the smell?! No, I love
it!

1479
01:56:30,780 --> 01:56:32,228
MARISHA: I'm painting a picture here!

1480
01:56:32,228 --> 01:56:33,788
SAM: No, I love it! Keep it coming!

1481
01:56:33,788 --> 01:56:42,554
MARISHA: You go through, and the smell comes from
this dank air passageway over in the corner, but

1482
01:56:42,554 --> 01:56:48,425
your scent leads you in another direction, and it
jettisons to the left, and it goes up to the

1483
01:56:48,425 --> 01:56:54,003
right, and you see up in this attic loft a
security room.

1484
01:56:54,003 --> 01:56:55,457
TALIESIN: Oh, there's a firewall.

1485
01:56:55,457 --> 01:56:59,460
MARISHA: And that's all you can see, and it snaps
you back into reality.

1486
01:56:59,460 --> 01:57:01,616
TALIESIN: They've got a firewall. I don't think
they got me.

1487
01:57:01,616 --> 01:57:03,400
BRIAN: Don't take the hat near the firewall.

1488
01:57:03,400 --> 01:57:04,772
TALIESIN: No, we're going to keep it very safe.

1489
01:57:04,772 --> 01:57:06,811
LIAM: Point of order. Excuse me, BM. BM?

1490
01:57:06,811 --> 01:57:09,942
SAM: Bear master? Beast master?

1491
01:57:09,942 --> 01:57:12,017
LIAM: Bear master, bee master. Take your pick.

1492
01:57:12,017 --> 01:57:13,445
MARISHA: I'll take beast master.

1493
01:57:13,445 --> 01:57:16,448
LIAM: Can you please paint a picture of the
outside of this building for us humble bears?

1494
01:57:16,448 --> 01:57:24,373
MARISHA: You've got a main thoroughfare in front
of you. Off to your left, you've got the town

1495
01:57:24,373 --> 01:57:30,181
center, where you guys were harassing and
terrifying people. There's a nice fountain in the

1496
01:57:30,181 --> 01:57:31,334
middle of it.

1497
01:57:31,334 --> 01:57:33,927
LIAM: Where we did our expert plan. Yeah, okay.

1498
01:57:33,927 --> 01:57:40,438
MARISHA: Fall foliage in the water of the
fountain. Still pretty rough-looking from where

1499
01:57:40,438 --> 01:57:47,039
there was a mass clearing out of people from the
bear attack, according to the guards. And then off

1500
01:57:47,039 --> 01:57:53,658
the main road, there's the Sun Kissed Inn. It's a
nice white building; looks like it's been pretty

1501
01:57:53,658 --> 01:57:59,653
well-kept. On the bottom floor, there's a tavern.
On the upstairs, there's a little inn you can stay

1502
01:57:59,653 --> 01:58:05,346
at, a little bed-and-breakfast. It's got nice
white columns. A little swinging wood sign says

1503
01:58:05,346 --> 01:58:09,702
Sun Kissed Tavern, with a sun rising up over top
of the title.

1504
01:58:09,702 --> 01:58:13,134
LIAM: What about a side entrance to the security
guard?

1505
01:58:13,134 --> 01:58:22,405
MARISHA: When you keep looking down the main road,
you see another alley-- no, wait. It's this way.

1506
01:58:22,405 --> 01:58:30,226
You see an alley that jettisons off to the left of
the tavern that looks in the direction that his

1507
01:58:30,226 --> 01:58:33,729
hacker sense was taking him.

1508
01:58:33,729 --> 01:58:36,696
LIAM: I didn't smell that. I wasn't there.

1509
01:58:36,696 --> 01:58:40,283
TALIESIN: I think we've got to go around the side.
I think that's our best bet.

1510
01:58:40,283 --> 01:58:41,289
LIAM: All right.

1511
01:58:41,289 --> 01:58:44,282
MARISHA: You've got a catty-corner dart.

1512
01:58:44,282 --> 01:58:48,407
MATT: I wipe the huff coloring off the sides of
Waffle's face.

1513
01:58:48,407 --> 01:58:51,222
SAM: Gold spray paint?

1514
01:58:51,222 --> 01:58:53,597
(laughter)

1515
01:58:53,597 --> 01:58:56,395
MATT: Careful. It ruins your brain.

1516
01:58:56,395 --> 01:58:59,700
BRIAN: You look like my aunt after church. Come
here. Let me get this.

1517
01:58:59,700 --> 01:59:03,133
MARISHA: A little dizzy. It wears off in a
second.

1518
01:59:03,133 --> 01:59:09,092
LIAM: All right. This is good. You're telling me
that the honey is not right through the main doors

1519
01:59:09,092 --> 01:59:10,313
of the tavern.

1520
01:59:10,313 --> 01:59:14,163
TALIESIN: It's deep inside. They've got it
definitely under heavy security.

1521
01:59:14,163 --> 01:59:19,888
LIAM: They've probably got some dipshit upstairs
guarding it, around the back. That's good. This

1522
01:59:19,888 --> 01:59:21,286
works in our favor.

1523
01:59:21,286 --> 01:59:22,366
SAM: I've got an idea.

1524
01:59:22,366 --> 01:59:23,535
MATT: What's your idea?

1525
01:59:23,535 --> 01:59:24,700
BRIAN: Spill the beans!

1526
01:59:24,700 --> 01:59:30,919
SAM: I make a tree right in the middle of the
lobby there. You use your fire stick. Set it on

1527
01:59:30,919 --> 01:59:39,860
fire. The whole place goes up. Problem solved!
Hey, I'm the muscle, all right? I don't come up

1528
01:59:39,860 --> 01:59:41,414
with the plans.

1529
01:59:41,414 --> 01:59:49,343
MATT: Tell you what. If everything goes ass to
sky, that'll be our backup to cover our tracks,

1530
01:59:49,343 --> 01:59:53,243
but we can't start with that. Hold onto it. It's
not a bad idea.

1531
01:59:53,243 --> 01:59:55,878
SAM: There are no bad ideas, right?

1532
01:59:55,878 --> 01:59:57,000
MATT: Exactly!

1533
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:04,429
TALIESIN: I don't know, maybe we finally heard
one.

1534
02:00:04,494 --> 02:00:08,720
MATT: Can we see, possibly, a stairway or entrance
door to an upper level?

1535
02:00:08,720 --> 02:00:15,309
MARISHA: You can see the entrance from where you
are in this alley. This alley, main street,

1536
02:00:15,309 --> 02:00:20,793
another alley across the street and down that way.
You can see the entrance of the alley, but you

1537
02:00:20,793 --> 02:00:22,791
can't see down it.

1538
02:00:22,791 --> 02:00:25,826
LIAM: We can see the stairway up to security
guards?

1539
02:00:25,826 --> 02:00:29,210
MARISHA: Maybe. You've got to make it to the
alley.

1540
02:00:29,210 --> 02:00:31,003
MATT: Let's get in the alley.

1541
02:00:31,003 --> 02:00:33,161
LIAM: I've got an idea brewing. Let's get a closer
look.

1542
02:00:33,161 --> 02:00:38,922
MARISHA: Everyone roll for criminal to stealthily
cross the street without being seen.

1543
02:00:38,922 --> 02:00:39,682
SAM: Fail!

1544
02:00:39,682 --> 02:00:40,751
MATT: Success.

1545
02:00:40,751 --> 02:00:41,404
LIAM: Fail!

1546
02:00:41,404 --> 02:00:42,805
BRIAN and TALIESIN: Success.

1547
02:00:42,805 --> 02:00:43,860
MARISHA: Okay.

1548
02:00:43,860 --> 02:00:45,601
MATT: Three out of five, maybe?

1549
02:00:45,601 --> 02:00:50,815
MARISHA: Yeah, I was going for a Matt Mercer skill
challenge, where half had to do good.

1550
02:00:50,815 --> 02:00:52,148
LIAM: Who the fuck is that?

1551
02:00:52,148 --> 02:00:53,913
MARISHA: Don't worry about it.

1552
02:00:53,913 --> 02:00:58,641
SAM: Half succeeded, right?

1553
02:00:58,641 --> 02:01:00,081
MARISHA: Yeah, half succeeded. Yeah.

1554
02:01:00,081 --> 02:01:01,238
TALIESIN: More than half.

1555
02:01:01,238 --> 02:01:02,565
MARISHA: You're an uneven number.

1556
02:01:02,565 --> 02:01:04,002
TALIESIN: Tie-breaker.

1557
02:01:04,002 --> 02:01:11,090
MARISHA: I'll allow it. Anyway, you guys crossed
the street, and now you're in the alleyway. At the

1558
02:01:11,090 --> 02:01:18,997
end of it, you see a black nondescript iron door.
It's a little open.

1559
02:01:18,997 --> 02:01:25,159
MATT: It's an iron door on a building made of wood
and plaster? What's the rest of the building

1560
02:01:25,159 --> 02:01:26,149
construct?

1561
02:01:26,149 --> 02:01:27,644
MARISHA: Brick. Brick building.

1562
02:01:27,644 --> 02:01:33,471
MATT: All right, and that door's slightly ajar.
Who wants to take a look at that door?

1563
02:01:33,471 --> 02:01:34,888
SAM: I can knock it in.

1564
02:01:34,888 --> 02:01:38,452
BRIAN: But it's already open! It's already open a
little bit.

1565
02:01:38,452 --> 02:01:45,186
LIAM: May be too good to be true. We go in there--
people, right? They're tricky. They've got brains

1566
02:01:45,186 --> 02:01:48,371
and stuff. Their intelligence is at least eight or
higher.

1567
02:01:48,371 --> 02:01:49,905
BRIAN: What?

1568
02:01:49,905 --> 02:01:52,906
MATT: I don't know. He's the brains.

1569
02:01:52,906 --> 02:01:57,895
LIAM: If we just go in there, it could fucking
blow up in our faces. Maybe that's what we do;

1570
02:01:57,895 --> 02:01:59,889
maybe we have no other option. Here's what I'm
thinking--

1571
02:01:59,889 --> 02:02:01,691
BRIAN: His plan is to blow up everybody's faces.

1572
02:02:01,691 --> 02:02:06,431
LIAM: That's going to blow up the honey, though.
You can't eat burned honey like that.

1573
02:02:06,431 --> 02:02:07,713
BRIAN: Is honey flammable?

1574
02:02:07,713 --> 02:02:08,772
SAM: Does honey burn?

1575
02:02:08,772 --> 02:02:10,506
TALIESIN: Honey absolutely burns.

1576
02:02:10,506 --> 02:02:14,141
BRIAN: What if we burn down everything, and the
only thing that's left is the honey, and then we move all

1577
02:02:14,181 --> 02:02:16,371
the bodies and scoop the honey into the Radio
Flyer?

1578
02:02:16,371 --> 02:02:19,810
LIAM: It's not your fault you're vegan. You have
very little experience with honey. Yes, the honey

1579
02:02:19,810 --> 02:02:20,905
will burn.

1580
02:02:20,905 --> 02:02:23,943
SAM: Nothing wrong with being a vegan, by the way.
I get just as much protein from bamboo.

1581
02:02:23,943 --> 02:02:27,790
LIAM: I'm not saying there's anything wrong with
it. I'm just saying it's real stupid, okay?

1582
02:02:27,790 --> 02:02:34,119
SAM: Listen, it's not my fault that I don't have
to kill an innocent animal to survive like you

1583
02:02:34,119 --> 02:02:35,359
fuckers do.

1584
02:02:35,359 --> 02:02:37,324
MATT: You killed a cow back there.

1585
02:02:37,324 --> 02:02:39,096
SAM: Cows don't count.

1586
02:02:39,096 --> 02:02:48,253
TALIESIN: Hey! We're all hungry. We all want some
honey. Some of us want some bamboo-- that's weird,

1587
02:02:48,253 --> 02:02:49,521
but that's okay.

1588
02:02:49,521 --> 02:02:51,775
BRIAN: Who's going through the door?

1589
02:02:51,775 --> 02:02:54,403
TALIESIN: You're the smallest. Just take a look.

1590
02:02:54,403 --> 02:02:57,174
BRIAN: I can check for traps.

1591
02:02:57,174 --> 02:03:02,910
LIAM: What's above the door? There are giant doors
on the ground floor, right? There's no stairs up

1592
02:03:02,910 --> 02:03:04,182
or nothing?

1593
02:03:04,182 --> 02:03:05,571
MARISHA: Do you want to peek in?

1594
02:03:05,571 --> 02:03:09,671
LIAM: No, I don't. I want to understand what I'm
looking at. Is it brick, stone?

1595
02:03:09,671 --> 02:03:11,305
MARISHA: There's a little stoop.

1596
02:03:11,305 --> 02:03:13,043
LIAM: The building is more than one floor?

1597
02:03:13,043 --> 02:03:14,393
MARISHA: Yes.

1598
02:03:14,393 --> 02:03:16,721
BRIAN: It's an inn with a tavern on the bottom
floor.

1599
02:03:16,721 --> 02:03:22,172
LIAM: Is it possible for a honey badger to climb
up the side of this building?

1600
02:03:22,172 --> 02:03:29,180
BRIAN: Yeah, is there some piping or perhaps a
beautiful Uncharted rope? Why don't you make me a

1601
02:03:29,180 --> 02:03:30,536
tree, you druid?

1602
02:03:30,536 --> 02:03:36,371
MARISHA: There is some piping. Yeah, you could
make a tree. There's some piping, and it goes up.

1603
02:03:36,371 --> 02:03:40,526
There's a little window that doesn't seem to have
much of a purchase, and then there is a balcony on

1604
02:03:40,526 --> 02:03:44,444
the front of the tavern that looks like it leads
to some suites.

1605
02:03:44,444 --> 02:03:48,817
SAM: Sweets! Oh, not like candy.

1606
02:03:48,817 --> 02:03:54,857
LIAM: This is what I'm thinking, and we could rush
in there; it wouldn't be the first time we've done

1607
02:03:54,857 --> 02:04:01,939
that, Waffle. But here's what I'm thinking: one of
us gets up higher than the door and waits, and

1608
02:04:01,939 --> 02:04:08,859
you, Trinket, you speak people pretty good. You
could fool people into thinking you're a human. So

1609
02:04:08,859 --> 02:04:16,012
we send somebody above the door, you knock on it,
draw them out, invite them into a conversation,

1610
02:04:16,012 --> 02:04:20,715
and when they start talking, bam! Honey badger on
their fucking head!

1611
02:04:20,715 --> 02:04:25,070
MATT: That's why you're the brains. All right,
Cookie's got it. Are we all in on this?

1612
02:04:25,070 --> 02:04:27,607
BRIAN: Oh, yeah. I like this one!

1613
02:04:27,607 --> 02:04:28,898
SAM: Do you need a tree?

1614
02:04:28,898 --> 02:04:39,232
BRIAN: No. I've got pipe. I've got suites! I've
got a cart I can jump off of.

1615
02:04:39,232 --> 02:04:41,448
MATT: Cart stays here.

1616
02:04:41,448 --> 02:04:49,077
BRIAN: I can put honey on my hands and stick to
the wall and climb all the way up! I'll use the pipe.

1617
02:04:49,077 --> 02:04:54,496
(laughter)

1618
02:04:54,496 --> 02:05:01,193
MARISHA: Okay. So as you bears are hiding in the
alley, you take this pipe and climb up it. Roll

1619
02:05:01,193 --> 02:05:03,337
for bear. Bear climbing.

1620
02:05:03,337 --> 02:05:08,864
BRIAN: Jesus fuck. Fail.

1621
02:05:08,864 --> 02:05:16,968
MARISHA: You get halfway up the pipe, and it's too
slippery, and you lose purchase, and you go

1622
02:05:16,968 --> 02:05:20,866
(sliding noise) and slide all the way back down.

1623
02:05:20,866 --> 02:05:23,053
BRIAN: What was the other way up?

1624
02:05:23,053 --> 02:05:24,246
SAM: Tree.

1625
02:05:24,246 --> 02:05:29,666
BRIAN: Can we try a tree? Hey, I had some--

1626
02:05:29,666 --> 02:05:31,360
TALIESIN: Never happened before.

1627
02:05:31,360 --> 02:05:33,898
BRIAN: This has never happened to me. I'm 27.

1628
02:05:33,898 --> 02:05:37,266
TALIESIN: That's very old for a honey badger.

1629
02:05:37,266 --> 02:05:41,657
LIAM: You're practically dead! 27?

1630
02:05:41,657 --> 02:05:44,596
SAM: 27?

1631
02:05:44,596 --> 02:05:49,715
BRIAN: I would take the stuff, but the last time,
I was climbing for over four hours--

1632
02:05:49,715 --> 02:05:53,587
SAM: I'm so sorry we're disrespecting an elderly
person.

1633
02:05:53,587 --> 02:05:56,501
LIAM: Don't eat the honey. Rub it into your
flesh.

1634
02:05:56,501 --> 02:05:59,365
SAM: He's not a bear, he's a prairie dog.

1635
02:05:59,365 --> 02:06:03,597
BRIAN: I am not a prairie dog.

1636
02:06:03,597 --> 02:06:09,151
MARISHA: Okay, so you were not feeling too bad
about falling off the post, and then these

1637
02:06:09,151 --> 02:06:12,356
assholes started making fun of you, and now you're
getting a little irritated. Put a point in bear from

1638
02:06:12,356 --> 02:06:13,423
criminal.

1639
02:06:13,423 --> 02:06:15,136
BRIAN: Wait, what?

1640
02:06:15,136 --> 02:06:16,982
MARISHA: Move a point from criminal to bear.

1641
02:06:16,982 --> 02:06:23,216
SAM: All right, here. Let me give you a tree.
Stand back! Stand back, everybody.

1642
02:06:23,216 --> 02:06:26,527
LIAM: Hey, buddy. Have some honey.

1643
02:06:26,527 --> 02:06:28,850
BRIAN: From the cart?

1644
02:06:28,850 --> 02:06:30,288
LIAM: You've earned it.

1645
02:06:30,288 --> 02:06:31,535
BRIAN: All right.

1646
02:06:31,535 --> 02:06:33,867
SAM: Boss, how has he earned it? He hasn't done
anything.

1647
02:06:33,867 --> 02:06:38,189
BRIAN: I tried to climb a pole, and I failed, and
you've been sitting down here taking dumps the

1648
02:06:38,189 --> 02:06:47,186
size of Trinket! Eating all that bamboo. We've got
to stop every five seconds pushing the cart so you

1649
02:06:47,186 --> 02:06:48,464
can take a dump!

1650
02:06:48,464 --> 02:06:52,675
LIAM: I need him to find his mojo again. Let him
have some honey.

1651
02:06:52,675 --> 02:06:59,759
MARISHA: You kill that last jar-- the first half
jar of honey-- to calm down a little bit.

1652
02:06:59,759 --> 02:07:04,352
LIAM: We're going to be swimming in honey any
minute now.

1653
02:07:04,352 --> 02:07:05,585
MARISHA: All right, Peddy.

1654
02:07:05,585 --> 02:07:08,218
SAM: You ready? Okay, stand back, everybody.

1655
02:07:08,218 --> 02:07:11,467
BRIAN: All right, make me a giant wood to climb.

1656
02:07:11,467 --> 02:07:13,899
SAM: I smash the stick down on the ground.

1657
02:07:13,899 --> 02:07:15,472
MARISHA: Roll for criminal.

1658
02:07:15,472 --> 02:07:18,576
SAM: Success.

1659
02:07:18,576 --> 02:07:30,241
MARISHA: Nice! It goes, and you get a big trunk.
Lopsided, and it crashes into the balcony a little

1660
02:07:30,241 --> 02:07:37,098
bit, but it gets there and then gets a little tree
growth at the end. It's not bad.

1661
02:07:37,098 --> 02:07:39,012
SAM: What kind of tree?

1662
02:07:39,012 --> 02:07:41,073
MARISHA: An oak.

1663
02:07:41,073 --> 02:07:42,343
SAM: Sure.

1664
02:07:42,343 --> 02:07:50,479
TALIESIN: Ah, the Marisha "no fucks given" voice.
What the fuck do you need, motherfucker?

1665
02:07:50,479 --> 02:07:52,745
MARISHA: A silver maple.

1666
02:07:52,745 --> 02:07:57,422
SAM: What color would the bark be?

1667
02:07:57,422 --> 02:08:00,679
MARISHA: Brown.

1668
02:08:00,679 --> 02:08:02,382
SAM: Lightish-brown?

1669
02:08:02,382 --> 02:08:04,772
MARISHA: No, this looks like--

1670
02:08:04,772 --> 02:08:06,329
SAM: Fuck it. I'm going to start eating it.

1671
02:08:06,329 --> 02:08:12,348
MARISHA: Okay. You start gnawing at the base of
the tree. As you're climbing, Peddy can't help

1672
02:08:12,348 --> 02:08:13,339
himself.

1673
02:08:13,339 --> 02:08:24,915
BRIAN: I climb up, get to the bushy part, to where
I can't be seen, and then I, real quick, pee down

1674
02:08:24,915 --> 02:08:30,370
onto Peddy and say: Honey badger don't care!

1675
02:08:30,370 --> 02:08:36,486
LIAM: This is a Foster badger.

1676
02:08:36,486 --> 02:08:39,967
(laughter)

1677
02:08:39,967 --> 02:08:41,993
MARISHA: You get up to the top of the balcony.

1678
02:08:41,993 --> 02:08:45,461
MATT: I loudly whisper: are you in place?

1679
02:08:45,461 --> 02:08:50,501
BRIAN: Yes. Wait! Okay, I'm finished.

1680
02:08:50,501 --> 02:09:01,387
MARISHA: You scurry up the tree, peek in the first
window. Empty suite, nicely made hotel bed.

1681
02:09:01,387 --> 02:09:03,156
BRIAN: Any honey?

1682
02:09:03,156 --> 02:09:05,537
MARISHA: No. Pretty empty.

1683
02:09:05,537 --> 02:09:08,073
BRIAN: They don't leave a little honey on the
pillow?

1684
02:09:08,073 --> 02:09:09,451
MARISHA: No honey samples.

1685
02:09:09,451 --> 02:09:13,346
SAM: Turndown service? Honey service?

1686
02:09:13,346 --> 02:09:17,862
LIAM: Liam! Liam, what are you doing up there?

1687
02:09:17,862 --> 02:09:25,494
BRIAN: I don't see any honey. I see a pretty nice
suite. I would stay here.

1688
02:09:25,494 --> 02:09:30,980
LIAM: Great. The plan is, you've got to teabag a
guy when he comes out the door, so stop peeking in

1689
02:09:30,980 --> 02:09:34,186
the windows now that you're done and get ready,
all right?

1690
02:09:34,186 --> 02:09:35,509
BRIAN: Okay.

1691
02:09:35,509 --> 02:09:39,635
LIAM: We're going to let the thespian here do his
thing, then back off.

1692
02:09:39,635 --> 02:09:42,702
BRIAN: The room is empty, and empty of honey.

1693
02:09:42,702 --> 02:09:47,155
MARISHA: There is another window up further from
it on the balcony.

1694
02:09:47,155 --> 02:09:50,633
BRIAN: Is it climbable? I'll climb over there.

1695
02:09:50,633 --> 02:09:52,233
LIAM: I swear to god--

1696
02:09:52,233 --> 02:09:55,530
SAM: Does the door look like it swings in or out?

1697
02:09:55,530 --> 02:09:56,585
MARISHA: Out.

1698
02:09:56,585 --> 02:09:57,778
SAM: It swings out?

1699
02:09:57,778 --> 02:09:59,231
BRIAN: And it's open a little bit, you said?

1700
02:09:59,231 --> 02:10:00,230
MARISHA: Yeah, it's cracked.

1701
02:10:00,230 --> 02:10:07,985
SAM: I'm going to stand in the cavity where the
door swings so I'll be hiding behind the door when

1702
02:10:07,985 --> 02:10:11,235
the door's open, just in case I need to deliver
some muscle.

1703
02:10:11,235 --> 02:10:12,738
MATT: That's a good idea.

1704
02:10:12,738 --> 02:10:14,699
BRIAN: Deliver some muscle?

1705
02:10:14,699 --> 02:10:16,244
SAM: Yeah, gopher. Shut up.

1706
02:10:16,244 --> 02:10:20,374
BRIAN: Like someone ordered it? You're going to
deliver muscle to someone? Hello! Muscle's here.

1707
02:10:20,374 --> 02:10:22,226
Someone ask for muscle?

1708
02:10:22,226 --> 02:10:23,652
SAM: Stop peeing on my tree.

1709
02:10:23,652 --> 02:10:24,943
MATT: Shut it!

1710
02:10:24,943 --> 02:10:26,800
LIAM: Everybody shut the fuck up, okay?

1711
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:28,016
BRIAN: It's not delivery, it's DiMuscle.

1712
02:10:28,016 --> 02:10:29,670
LIAM: Hey, meerkat? Zip it.

1713
02:10:29,670 --> 02:10:33,154
BRIAN: Sorry. I'm going to go look at this other
window.

1714
02:10:33,154 --> 02:10:35,190
MATT: Are you in place?

1715
02:10:35,190 --> 02:10:37,381
TALIESIN: He's doing something.

1716
02:10:37,381 --> 02:10:39,108
BRIAN: I'm going to check out the other window.

1717
02:10:39,108 --> 02:10:44,786
MARISHA: You peek up carefully, after these guys
yelled at you, and as you peek up, you see a

1718
02:10:44,786 --> 02:10:52,742
room. It looks like it's a hotel suite that's been
taken over temporarily for the Hazel Festival.

1719
02:10:52,742 --> 02:10:58,868
It's covered in black curtains. There's a little
sliver of curtain that you're peeking through.

1720
02:10:58,868 --> 02:11:10,223
Inside, you see square scrying mirrors lined up
along the wall. Papers, a writing desk, and a man

1721
02:11:10,223 --> 02:11:16,748
in a security uniform-- Westruun colors, of
course-- walking back and forth, pacing. Looks

1722
02:11:16,748 --> 02:11:18,492
like he's talking over an earpiece.

1723
02:11:18,492 --> 02:11:26,803
BRIAN: Hey! I see the future victim of my
teabagging! He's here.

1724
02:11:26,803 --> 02:11:27,722
MATT: Up there?

1725
02:11:27,722 --> 02:11:31,995
BRIAN: Yeah, he's in the window. He's got
something in his head.

1726
02:11:31,995 --> 02:11:37,844
LIAM: Look, Trinket's going to knock. Tell us what
he does when Trinket knocks.

1727
02:11:37,844 --> 02:11:40,204
BRIAN: Okay. But don't teabag him yet?

1728
02:11:40,204 --> 02:11:41,618
SAM: Trinket?

1729
02:11:41,618 --> 02:11:42,621
MATT: Yes?

1730
02:11:42,621 --> 02:11:47,308
SAM: If you get in trouble and need me to swing
the door and cause some "panda-monium"

1731
02:11:47,308 --> 02:11:48,316
-- trademarked--

1732
02:11:48,316 --> 02:11:52,534
TALIESIN: We almost made it.

1733
02:11:52,534 --> 02:11:54,325
MARISHA: Surprised that hadn't happened sooner.

1734
02:11:54,325 --> 02:11:56,861
BRIAN: Almost made it. I just lost $500.

1735
02:11:56,861 --> 02:12:02,163
(laughter)

1736
02:12:02,163 --> 02:12:04,992
BRIAN: I've got to call a guy after this!

1737
02:12:04,992 --> 02:12:06,469
MATT: Go on.

1738
02:12:06,469 --> 02:12:09,049
SAM: What's the signal? Give me a code word. Give
me a signal.

1739
02:12:09,049 --> 02:12:18,537
MATT: The codeword is... dollars. How about that?

1740
02:12:18,537 --> 02:12:22,687
SAM: Dollars? Okay. Why would that come up in a
conversation?

1741
02:12:22,687 --> 02:12:25,137
MATT: I don't know. Figure it out.

1742
02:12:25,137 --> 02:12:28,914
LIAM: Dollars, dollars, dollars!

1743
02:12:28,914 --> 02:12:29,910
TALIESIN: Dollars!

1744
02:12:29,910 --> 02:12:31,016
MATT: I don't know. All right.

1745
02:12:31,016 --> 02:12:32,854
SAM: All right, I'm ready.

1746
02:12:32,854 --> 02:12:34,696
MATT: (thudding)

1747
02:12:34,696 --> 02:12:43,749
MARISHA: Las Vegas, you see him look over his
shoulder, and he frustratedly goes,

1748
02:12:43,749 --> 02:12:50,371
"Get on out of here. Go away! I'm busy." 
And he goes back and starts looking back into

1749
02:12:50,371 --> 02:12:55,745
the mirrors, occasionally being like, "Any sign 
of them? Anyone find those goddamn bears?"

1750
02:12:55,745 --> 02:12:57,246
MATT: Anything?

1751
02:12:57,246 --> 02:13:02,011
BRIAN: They're definitely looking for you bears,
that's for sure.

1752
02:13:02,011 --> 02:13:03,752
MATT: (thudding)

1753
02:13:03,752 --> 02:13:12,161
MARISHA: "Ugh. Goddamn it." You see him leave the
room. Trinket, you start hearing--

1754
02:13:12,161 --> 02:13:14,513
BRIAN: He's coming down!

1755
02:13:14,513 --> 02:13:19,275
MATT: I begin to move a little bit off to the side
of the door where it'll be opening, so only part

1756
02:13:19,275 --> 02:13:20,707
of me is visible.

1757
02:13:20,707 --> 02:13:22,911
BRIAN: I climb into the room and under the bed.

1758
02:13:22,911 --> 02:13:24,644
MARISHA: Okay.

1759
02:13:24,644 --> 02:13:29,239
TALIESIN: We're on either side. I'm going to push
against the side of the wall.

1760
02:13:29,239 --> 02:13:32,913
LIAM: How's your criminal looking? Not too high,
Brian. Not too high.

1761
02:13:32,913 --> 02:13:34,746
MATT: I keep knocking.

1762
02:13:34,746 --> 02:13:38,603
MARISHA: He goes, "All right, all right!" He
throws open the door. "What, goddamn it?"

1763
02:13:38,603 --> 02:13:40,965
LIAM: Las Vegas!

1764
02:13:40,965 --> 02:13:53,119
MATT: Have you heard of our lord and savior of
latter-day Allhammer?

1765
02:13:53,119 --> 02:13:58,929
MARISHA: "You guys, I think the bears are rabid,
and I think they're trying to talk to me.

1766
02:13:58,929 --> 02:14:01,676
"I think I've got one right here. 
I'll be goddamned."

1767
02:14:01,676 --> 02:14:05,751
MATT: Make some dollars. Make some dollars. 
Make some dollars! Dollars! Dollars!

1768
02:14:05,751 --> 02:14:07,276
BRIAN: I'm coming down.

1769
02:14:07,276 --> 02:14:08,588
SAM: I'm going for it!

1770
02:14:08,588 --> 02:14:10,895
BRIAN: Attack!

1771
02:14:10,895 --> 02:14:18,613
MARISHA: Okay. The poor guy gets flanked. From
behind the open door, he gets slammed with an iron

1772
02:14:18,613 --> 02:14:25,649
door to the face as a panda bear comes out from
the other side, and right as he sees this big

1773
02:14:25,649 --> 02:14:31,327
black-and-white face come around the corner, Liam
Las Vegas comes from behind and gets him in the

1774
02:14:31,327 --> 02:14:36,763
back, in the nape of the neck. Roll for bear. You
get carnal advantage.

1775
02:14:36,763 --> 02:14:40,524
MATT: Carnal advantage? That's a different skill.

1776
02:14:40,524 --> 02:14:42,209
BRIAN: Success!

1777
02:14:42,249 --> 02:14:43,238
SAM: Fail.

1778
02:14:43,238 --> 02:14:52,172
MARISHA: Okay. He's distracted by you. I don't
think you understood the term "dollars," and you

1779
02:14:52,172 --> 02:14:58,960
waved dopily, and he is now grabbing onto your
scruff, fighting, and he slams the back of his

1780
02:14:58,960 --> 02:15:02,998
head into the wall, beating you up a little bit.
Take a point in bear.

1781
02:15:02,998 --> 02:15:06,948
SAM: Take a point to bear or off bear?

1782
02:15:06,948 --> 02:15:09,059
MARISHA: A point from criminal to bear.

1783
02:15:09,059 --> 02:15:10,602
BRIAN: Oh shit. Okay.

1784
02:15:10,602 --> 02:15:16,791
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and very slyly snatch
his earring in the commotion.

1785
02:15:16,791 --> 02:15:19,077
LIAM: God, his ear's going to come off.

1786
02:15:19,077 --> 02:15:21,159
TALIESIN: I may hack the ear.

1787
02:15:21,159 --> 02:15:24,754
MARISHA: Hack the ear? Okay.

1788
02:15:24,754 --> 02:15:29,198
TALIESIN: Try to hack the earring. I'm going to
try and grab it and put it on my ear.

1789
02:15:29,198 --> 02:15:31,632
MARISHA: All right, roll for criminal.

1790
02:15:31,632 --> 02:15:33,308
TALIESIN: With hacker advantage.

1791
02:15:33,308 --> 02:15:35,275
MARISHA: Sure. Ear hacking.

1792
02:15:35,275 --> 02:15:37,276
TALIESIN: Going for it.

1793
02:15:37,276 --> 02:15:38,968
LIAM: Come on, Waffle.

1794
02:15:38,968 --> 02:15:40,780
TALIESIN: No, I fail.

1795
02:15:40,780 --> 02:15:48,638
MARISHA: Okay. The guy is thrashing around too
much. As you go to reach for his ear, he

1796
02:15:48,638 --> 02:15:55,019
immediately sucker-punches you in the jaw. Take a
point into bear.

1797
02:15:55,019 --> 02:16:00,947
MATT: Okay, if this is happening, I turn to Cookie
and say: Hold him down. He's got a kid; we can't

1798
02:16:00,947 --> 02:16:02,164
kill him.

1799
02:16:02,164 --> 02:16:04,442
SAM: He's got a kid?

1800
02:16:04,442 --> 02:16:06,526
MATT: Yeah, the kid that gave us the information.

1801
02:16:06,526 --> 02:16:07,998
MAIRSHA: "Head of security!"

1802
02:16:07,998 --> 02:16:10,980
SAM: That's right.

1803
02:16:10,980 --> 02:16:12,776
TALIESIN: I had totally forgotten that there was
any relation.

1804
02:16:12,776 --> 02:16:16,568
MATT: I'm the only hero here, apparently.

1805
02:16:16,568 --> 02:16:18,714
TALIESIN: No, this is like Captain Planet. You're
Heart.

1806
02:16:18,714 --> 02:16:20,326
MATT: Apparently, yeah.

1807
02:16:20,326 --> 02:16:28,850
MARISHA: Liam, you hear-- Liam Las Vegas, you
hear, since you're right up on his neck, you hear

1808
02:16:28,850 --> 02:16:36,046
over the earpiece, very faintly: "Hey, boss? Okay,
we're heading your way, boss. Boss, come in."

1809
02:16:36,046 --> 02:16:43,721
BRIAN: Don't come here! I am fine. I have no-- 
I am not in any danger!

1810
02:16:43,721 --> 02:16:46,481
Everything is perfectly fine!

1811
02:16:46,481 --> 02:16:48,071
MARISHA: "Boss?"

1812
02:16:48,071 --> 02:16:50,637
BRIAN: This is how he was talking before!

1813
02:16:50,637 --> 02:16:55,113
MARISHA: You hear, "Boss Buford? I mean no
offense, but have you been drinking again?"

1814
02:16:55,113 --> 02:16:58,923
BRIAN: Maybe a tiny bit. Look, it was a slow
night.

1815
02:16:58,923 --> 02:17:04,746
MARISHA: Buford slams you up against the wall
again. What are the rest of you all doing?

1816
02:17:04,746 --> 02:17:13,590
MATT: I'm going to pull him off of Buford, as he's
slammed Las Vegas into the wall. I'm going to pull

1817
02:17:13,590 --> 02:17:18,256
Vegas off while I slam <i>him</i> into the wall and get
my bear snout right into his face and give him an

1818
02:17:18,256 --> 02:17:20,975
intimidating growl to get him to stop thrashing.

1819
02:17:20,975 --> 02:17:24,973
MARISHA: Okay, roll for terrify with advantage
under your bear stat.

1820
02:17:24,973 --> 02:17:27,435
MATT: I succeed, with a one.

1821
02:17:27,435 --> 02:17:34,521
MARISHA: He goes, "All right. Just... I'll let you
go."

1822
02:17:34,521 --> 02:17:39,921
MATT: I look at him, and I point with a bear claw
and go, (grunts). And I take some of the honey

1823
02:17:39,921 --> 02:17:47,709
from my bearpit and go, (grunts). Where?

1824
02:17:47,709 --> 02:17:52,748
MARISHA: "Did you just say 'where?' Holy shit."

1825
02:17:52,748 --> 02:17:54,098
MATT: Where?

1826
02:17:54,098 --> 02:18:00,772
MARISHA: "All right. Look, it's down there. 
Go through the Sun Kissed Inn.

1827
02:18:00,772 --> 02:18:04,830
"Go into the cellar room. There's a door. 
You've got to get on the other side of it.

1828
02:18:04,830 --> 02:18:09,701
"Look, just-- here." 
And he pulls out of his back pocket.

1829
02:18:09,701 --> 02:18:18,779
"I fucking hate this job, anyway. It's a piece 
of shit. Go get the honey, all right?"

1830
02:18:18,779 --> 02:18:29,985
MATT: I wipe the honey back in my bear pit and
pull him off to where the door is, where it's

1831
02:18:29,985 --> 02:18:31,776
open, make sure that all of us are inside--

1832
02:18:31,776 --> 02:18:37,351
MARISHA: He looks at the badger, and he goes,
"Here." He doesn't know what you're doing, so in

1833
02:18:37,351 --> 02:18:42,903
another attempt, pulls out a honey sample from his
pocket and goes, "Here!"

1834
02:18:42,903 --> 02:18:45,007
BRIAN: (eager growling)

1835
02:18:45,007 --> 02:18:48,490
MARISHA: And he throws it behind your shoulder to
get you to run away.

1836
02:18:48,490 --> 02:18:54,352
MATT: Do you want to grab the barrel and bring it
in?

1837
02:18:54,352 --> 02:18:56,580
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're getting everything.

1838
02:18:56,580 --> 02:19:06,724
MATT: Okay, so as soon as we get our last honey
jar, the de Rolo Roller in, I shove him back out

1839
02:19:06,724 --> 02:19:10,756
and close the metal door, and then try and find a
way to lock it.

1840
02:19:10,756 --> 02:19:12,527
MARISHA: How are you going to lock it?

1841
02:19:12,527 --> 02:19:15,400
TALIESIN: Is it digital?

1842
02:19:15,400 --> 02:19:21,914
MATT: (laughs) Is there any sort of locking
mechanism or a barricade?

1843
02:19:21,914 --> 02:19:29,287
MARISHA: It's pretty smooth on the outside. Seems
like most of the locking handles are from the

1844
02:19:29,287 --> 02:19:30,631
other side.

1845
02:19:30,631 --> 02:19:34,688
SAM: We could put some stuff in front of the door.
Is there any stuff around the room?

1846
02:19:34,688 --> 02:19:36,853
MARISHA: You did summon a giant tree trunk.

1847
02:19:36,853 --> 02:19:39,142
SAM: We could. Wait, what did you say, boss?

1848
02:19:39,142 --> 02:19:42,364
LIAM: What's to stop the kid from squealing that
we done just thrown out the door?

1849
02:19:42,364 --> 02:19:44,524
BRIAN: I ripped his tongue out before we left.

1850
02:19:44,524 --> 02:19:45,656
LIAM: Did you?

1851
02:19:45,656 --> 02:19:47,595
BRIAN: Nah. I thought about it for a second.

1852
02:19:47,595 --> 02:19:53,735
MARISHA: As you're holding the door, you hear,
(thudding) "Hey, come on!" from the other side.

1853
02:19:53,735 --> 02:19:56,229
SAM: Want me to make a trunk?

1854
02:19:56,229 --> 02:19:59,681
MATT: Peddy, knock him out. I open the door.

1855
02:19:59,681 --> 02:20:03,110
SAM: All right, I'm going to bum-rush him.

1856
02:20:03,110 --> 02:20:05,380
MARISHA: Okay, roll two because you're the
muscle.

1857
02:20:05,380 --> 02:20:07,087
LIAM: Drag his ass in here, Peddy.

1858
02:20:07,087 --> 02:20:10,661
SAM: It doesn't matter. I succeeded on the first
one.

1859
02:20:10,661 --> 02:20:17,736
MARISHA: As the door swings back open, he's met
with a giant panda bear head.

1860
02:20:17,736 --> 02:20:20,292
SAM: (roars)

1861
02:20:20,292 --> 02:20:24,128
MARISHA: He gets whacked in the head and falls
unconscious immediately.

1862
02:20:24,128 --> 02:20:25,739
BRIAN: Can I search his body for more honey?

1863
02:20:25,739 --> 02:20:31,654
MARISHA: Sure. You don't find any. You do find an
old biscuit.

1864
02:20:31,654 --> 02:20:33,260
BRIAN: How old?

1865
02:20:33,260 --> 02:20:41,062
MARISHA: Looks like he put it in his pocket from
this morning. It's a little style. A little stale.

1866
02:20:41,062 --> 02:20:47,775
Not style. It's a little stale. It's an everything
biscuit, like an everything bagel, but an

1867
02:20:47,775 --> 02:20:49,135
everything biscuit.

1868
02:20:49,135 --> 02:20:53,616
TALIESIN: Slayer's Cake. Everything biscuit.

1869
02:20:53,616 --> 02:20:55,946
BRIAN: Isn't that the fraternity initiation
biscuit?

1870
02:20:55,946 --> 02:20:57,613
SAM: Oh, gross.

1871
02:20:57,613 --> 02:21:01,322
BRIAN: She said "everything biscuit," and don't
say "gross" to me, Sam Riegel.

1872
02:21:01,322 --> 02:21:04,651
LIAM: Where does my nose tell me where to go?

1873
02:21:04,651 --> 02:21:13,789
MARISHA: Well, the Sun Kissed Inn, the entrance is
out and through the front door. It's not. This

1874
02:21:13,789 --> 02:21:17,413
appears to be separate, leading up.

1875
02:21:17,413 --> 02:21:20,493
TALIESIN: We've got to get in. I want to take a
look at that security room.

1876
02:21:20,493 --> 02:21:25,634
MARISHA: You open the door. You look behind the
guy unconscious on the floor. Are you going to do

1877
02:21:25,634 --> 02:21:26,814
anything with his body?

1878
02:21:26,814 --> 02:21:29,734
SAM: I'm going to drag it inside and look for a
place to stow it.

1879
02:21:29,734 --> 02:21:31,083
BRIAN: Does he have any keys on his body?

1880
02:21:31,083 --> 02:21:33,187
TALIESIN: Use him to prop the door closed.

1881
02:21:33,187 --> 02:21:36,183
MARISHA: He does have keys on his body, yes.

1882
02:21:36,183 --> 02:21:37,445
BRIAN: Can I take those keys?

1883
02:21:37,445 --> 02:21:38,562
MARISHA: You can take those keys.

1884
02:21:38,562 --> 02:21:42,241
BRIAN: Put them in the de Rolo Roller.

1885
02:21:42,241 --> 02:21:44,453
MARISHA: Yeah, okay.

1886
02:21:44,453 --> 02:21:48,114
BRIAN: In case we want to go up 
to the honeymoon suite.

1887
02:21:48,114 --> 02:21:53,508
MARISHA: This is literally just a stairwell entrance.
It's very thin, clearly there for service and

1888
02:21:53,508 --> 02:21:59,775
bringing in stock. It's a narrow little room.
There seems to be a cupboard under the stairs, if

1889
02:21:59,775 --> 02:22:01,122
you want to stash him there.

1890
02:22:01,122 --> 02:22:05,294
SAM: I'm going to grab him with my teeth 
and try to shove him under the stairs.

1891
02:22:05,294 --> 02:22:12,016
MARISHA: There's a thin stairwell that goes up and
opens up into a loft area. There's one door that

1892
02:22:12,016 --> 02:22:16,391
looks like it was suite #1 and another door that
looks like it was suite #2, where this was.

1893
02:22:16,391 --> 02:22:17,588
LIAM: Get up there.

1894
02:22:17,588 --> 02:22:26,397
MARISHA: As you guys enter in, you open the room.
You see four screens. They're all scrying mirrors.

1895
02:22:26,397 --> 02:22:32,720
A few notes, a few papers, binoculars. A few
bottles of mead. Looks like Buford

1896
02:22:32,720 --> 02:22:34,044
was having a good time.

1897
02:22:34,044 --> 02:22:35,489
MATT: Is it honey mead?

1898
02:22:35,489 --> 02:22:36,635
MARISHA: It is honey mead.

1899
02:22:36,635 --> 02:22:37,923
TALIESIN: All mead is honey mead.

1900
02:22:37,923 --> 02:22:43,783
MATT: I know, but I'm a bear, so I have to
clarify. Can I take one of the bottles

1901
02:22:43,783 --> 02:22:44,852
and drink it?

1902
02:22:44,852 --> 02:22:45,912
MARISHA: You do.

1903
02:22:45,912 --> 02:22:48,143
MATT: (gulping)

1904
02:22:48,143 --> 02:22:56,380
MARISHA: I would say you put a point back into
bear from criminal. You are a little tipsy,

1905
02:22:56,380 --> 02:22:59,187
though, for a little bit.

1906
02:22:59,187 --> 02:23:01,466
MATT: (slurred) It's fine. We're good!

1907
02:23:01,466 --> 02:23:04,860
MARISHA: I don't know how terrifying you might be
for a little bit.

1908
02:23:04,860 --> 02:23:07,436
MATT: Oh, you haven't been around the right people
and enough mead.

1909
02:23:07,436 --> 02:23:12,826
BRIAN: This reminds me, fellows, of the time
Trinket got a little too drunk

1910
02:23:12,826 --> 02:23:14,610
when we were all out at--

1911
02:23:14,610 --> 02:23:18,118
MATT: In this room?

1912
02:23:18,118 --> 02:23:22,999
BRIAN: (laughing) I need a flashback really bad.

1913
02:23:22,999 --> 02:23:26,309
SAM: We just met this guy an hour ago.

1914
02:23:26,309 --> 02:23:29,802
BRIAN: Well, this reminds me of when my cousin
Blinket--

1915
02:23:29,802 --> 02:23:35,592
SAM: Who will also be portrayed by Matthew Mercer
in the flashback? Sure.

1916
02:23:35,592 --> 02:23:40,061
BRIAN: One time, he also got really-- 
I don't know why I went western all of a sudden.

1917
02:23:40,061 --> 02:23:42,015
Anyway, flashback.

1918
02:23:42,015 --> 02:23:43,483
LIAM: He was a bush baby.

1919
02:23:43,483 --> 02:23:46,396
MATT: I'm so drunk and your cousin.

1920
02:23:46,396 --> 02:23:48,582
BRIAN: Ah, he's my cousin.

1921
02:23:48,582 --> 02:23:50,516
MATT: I'm a cousin who's drunk.

1922
02:23:50,516 --> 02:23:56,059
BRIAN: Yeah, anyway, and sadly, we had to take old
Blinket out back and shoot him, because it turned

1923
02:23:56,059 --> 02:23:59,506
out he wasn't our cousin. He was brought into town
by the circus.

1924
02:23:59,506 --> 02:24:06,702
MARISHA: Wow. Holy shit. That definitely qualifies
as a flashback to being a criminal. Get a point

1925
02:24:06,702 --> 02:24:10,614
back from bear to criminal. You're good.

1926
02:24:10,614 --> 02:24:15,493
TALIESIN: I want to take a look at this weird
security system that they have here with all these

1927
02:24:15,493 --> 02:24:20,297
mirrors. Are they viewing other rooms?

1928
02:24:20,297 --> 02:24:27,185
MARISHA: They are. You look at one of them. The
first one is the town square. The second one looks

1929
02:24:27,185 --> 02:24:32,945
like the entrance to the tavern. You see a few
people passed out drunk at tables and a lot of

1930
02:24:32,945 --> 02:24:50,071
action going on. The other two, there's codes in
the corner. It says S-C-R-Y-C-A-M-S-L-R-1.

1931
02:24:50,071 --> 02:24:53,176
Wait, C-L-R-1 and C-L-R-2. It's not important.

1932
02:24:53,176 --> 02:25:01,808
(laughter)

1933
02:25:01,855 --> 02:25:04,588
TALIESIN: Isn't it, though? Isn't it kind of
fucking important, really?

1934
02:25:04,588 --> 02:25:10,029
MARISHA: There's town square, tavern, cellar room
one, cellar room two. That's all you need.

1935
02:25:10,029 --> 02:25:11,919
LIAM: That's what's on these papers here?

1936
02:25:11,919 --> 02:25:19,122
MARISHA: That's what's blinking in the corner of
each of these cameras. Mirrors. Scrying mirrors.

1937
02:25:19,122 --> 02:25:22,514
TALIESIN: I think I can hack these mirrors.

1938
02:25:22,514 --> 02:25:25,482
MARISHA: All right, try to hack the mirrors.

1939
02:25:25,482 --> 02:25:26,981
TALIESIN: I want them to run a loop.

1940
02:25:26,981 --> 02:25:28,522
MARISHA: You want to throw them on a loop?

1941
02:25:28,522 --> 02:25:30,045
TALIESIN: I want to throw them on a loop.

1942
02:25:30,045 --> 02:25:31,323
LIAM: Let the bear work. Let him do his thing.

1943
02:25:31,323 --> 02:25:39,393
MARISHA: That's pretty good. All right, hacker
bear. Roll for hacking.

1944
02:25:39,393 --> 02:25:45,040
TALIESIN: I'm going to mime keyboarding, 
but in doing so, it's going to somehow

1945
02:25:45,040 --> 02:25:46,989
affect a magical spell.

1946
02:25:46,989 --> 02:25:48,228
MARISHA: Sure.

1947
02:25:48,228 --> 02:25:49,721
LIAM: You've got this, Waffle.

1948
02:25:49,721 --> 02:25:53,796
BRIAN: (singing) You came in like a hacker bear.

1949
02:25:53,796 --> 02:25:57,492
TALIESIN: Yeah! Double two.

1950
02:25:57,492 --> 02:26:06,809
MARISHA: As you're hacking, you get a waft of air
from one of the vents off to the side, and it

1951
02:26:06,809 --> 02:26:17,034
brings you back to the pipes in the tunnels, and
in your cracked-out state, you somehow connect to

1952
02:26:17,034 --> 02:26:22,440
the mainframe, and it takes you through, and you
see the tavern, and you see two people passed out

1953
02:26:22,440 --> 02:26:27,852
drunk, and you go through into the first room, and
you see a few tripwires that seem to be strung out

1954
02:26:27,852 --> 02:26:34,382
across the long hallway, and then you go into the
last room, and you see three pedestals, with a

1955
02:26:34,382 --> 02:26:39,235
bunch of honey stacked onto these pedestals. It's
very dimly lit, but you recognize the shape of

1956
02:26:39,235 --> 02:26:40,739
fucking honey barrels.

1957
02:26:40,739 --> 02:26:44,087
TALIESIN: Motherfucking honey barrels.

1958
02:26:44,087 --> 02:26:46,466
LIAM: Barrels? Did you say <i>barrels</i>?

1959
02:26:46,466 --> 02:26:48,038
TALIESIN: We hit the mother lode.

1960
02:26:48,038 --> 02:26:50,752
BRIAN: I don't know if I have room on the cart for
all of this.

1961
02:26:50,752 --> 02:26:59,976
MARISHA: You go back, and you see Matrix code 
go in front of you, and lights fly by.

1962
02:26:59,976 --> 02:27:06,818
LIAM: Some people see zeros and ones, 
but all I see is honeybees and salmon.

1963
02:27:06,818 --> 02:27:09,391
(laughter)

1964
02:27:09,391 --> 02:27:14,703
MARISHA: You see a bunch of worker bees 
in a hex pattern that looks code-y.

1965
02:27:14,703 --> 02:27:17,377
It's a little green, a little black, like DOS.

1966
02:27:17,377 --> 02:27:18,789
TALIESIN: I'm starting to believe!

1967
02:27:18,789 --> 02:27:23,042
MARISHA: The rest of you see Waffle get a little
nosebleed.

1968
02:27:23,042 --> 02:27:27,235
MATT: Waffle. Waffle!

1969
02:27:27,235 --> 02:27:37,532
MARISHA: As you snap back, you look, and you saw
one guard walk by in the town square entrance.

1970
02:27:37,532 --> 02:27:42,876
About 30 seconds, same guard walks by.

1971
02:27:42,876 --> 02:27:44,826
SAM: It's on a loop.

1972
02:27:44,826 --> 02:27:46,881
TALIESIN: We're clear.

1973
02:27:46,881 --> 02:27:48,561
LIAM: Waffle's going to fight Sugarcone!

1974
02:27:48,561 --> 02:27:59,414
MARISHA: It seems, through whatever magic that you
have tapped into, you have been a little touched

1975
02:27:59,414 --> 02:28:05,528
by the security cam. Security hacking.

1976
02:28:05,528 --> 02:28:13,530
TALIESIN: What?! Wow. This is insane.

1977
02:28:13,530 --> 02:28:15,758
MARISHA: You have to be able to see the honey.

1978
02:28:15,758 --> 02:28:22,891
TALIESIN: No, I get it. This will definitely not
come in useful at all. This is useless and dumb,

1979
02:28:22,891 --> 02:28:24,463
and I can't wait to do it.

1980
02:28:24,463 --> 02:28:31,234
MARISHA: He comes back, and Waffle's got a little
gloss to his eyes. A little bit of a green glow

1981
02:28:31,234 --> 02:28:34,576
crosses them.

1982
02:28:34,576 --> 02:28:39,141
TALIESIN: Ready for an Eggo Waffle. 
I've upgraded to Eggo.

1983
02:28:39,141 --> 02:28:41,371
BRIAN: You look more Belgian to me.

1984
02:28:41,371 --> 02:28:43,253
LIAM: You all right, brother bear?

1985
02:28:43,253 --> 02:28:44,495
TALIESIN: Never better.

1986
02:28:44,495 --> 02:28:46,505
SAM: How do we get down there, 
or wherever we've got to go?

1987
02:28:46,505 --> 02:28:48,419
TALIESIN: That I can't tell you, but I bought us
some time.

1988
02:28:48,419 --> 02:28:50,137
BRIAN: Why is your voice so lame now?

1989
02:28:50,137 --> 02:28:51,504
SAM: I'm sorry.

1990
02:28:51,504 --> 02:28:57,963
MATT: (laughs) Hey, Peddy? Which one of these
rooms has the tree outside of it?

1991
02:28:57,963 --> 02:29:04,196
SAM: It was the one on the left, which is the
first one that he went to. The empty one.

1992
02:29:04,196 --> 02:29:08,225
MATT: All right, we'll follow Vegas. Lead us to
the tree. We'll climb down and go around to the

1993
02:29:08,225 --> 02:29:09,387
inside of the tavern.

1994
02:29:09,387 --> 02:29:13,433
MARISHA: That's good, because right as you walk
out onto the balcony, you see that guard who was

1995
02:29:13,433 --> 02:29:17,590
walking through that you captured on your loop
start walking around, going,

1996
02:29:17,590 --> 02:29:21,055
"Hey, boss? Boss, you here?"

1997
02:29:21,055 --> 02:29:24,829
MATT: Hey, Peddy? Take him out.

1998
02:29:24,829 --> 02:29:26,513
SMA: Where is he? He's down below us?

1999
02:29:26,513 --> 02:29:31,614
MARISHA: He's walking under the balcony, 
looking like he's going to go around

2000
02:29:31,614 --> 02:29:33,332
that alleyway, up to that door.

2001
02:29:33,332 --> 02:29:35,937
LIAM: Peddy, teabag that motherfucker.

2002
02:29:35,937 --> 02:29:39,432
SAM: I'm muscle, but I'm not aerodynamic. 
I climb up bamboo, I don't--

2003
02:29:39,432 --> 02:29:41,996
LIAM: I boot him out the window.

2004
02:29:41,996 --> 02:29:46,097
SAM: (screams)

2005
02:29:46,097 --> 02:30:00,009
MARISHA: Roll for criminal aim, as you try to time
pushing Peddy Tuxpin.

2006
02:30:00,009 --> 02:30:04,180
LIAM: Come on, don't fuck me. One. Yeah.

2007
02:30:04,180 --> 02:30:14,917
MARISHA: You accurately, with great precision,
teabag this poor guard and fall right on top of

2008
02:30:14,917 --> 02:30:17,990
him. He's not dead; he's definitely unconscious,
though.

2009
02:30:17,990 --> 02:30:24,074
TALIESIN: The last thing he saw before going
unconscious were panda testicles at full speed.

2010
02:30:24,074 --> 02:30:26,468
As he screams--

2011
02:30:26,468 --> 02:30:30,056
MATT: A giant tanuki flash.

2012
02:30:30,056 --> 02:30:34,349
MARISHA: He quite literally does not know 
what hit him.

2013
02:30:34,349 --> 02:30:40,412
BRIAN: Next week's Wyrmwood giveaway is
"pandasack." That is the new keyword.

2014
02:30:40,412 --> 02:30:42,665
MATT: It is. Boom.

2015
02:30:42,665 --> 02:30:44,128
BRIAN: Write that down, Max.

2016
02:30:44,128 --> 02:30:47,521
SAM: Ugh, I landed on my nuts!

2017
02:30:47,521 --> 02:30:49,272
BRIAN: Wasn't that the idea?

2018
02:30:49,272 --> 02:30:52,603
MATT: Good job, Peddy! All right, everyone. 
Down the tree. Come on.

2019
02:30:52,603 --> 02:30:57,741
LIAM: Another dose of high art 
from Critical Role.

2020
02:30:57,741 --> 02:31:04,133
TALIESIN: That's the most useful panda testicles
have been in a long time.

2021
02:31:04,133 --> 02:31:06,266
I'm just going to point that out.

2022
02:31:06,266 --> 02:31:14,174
MARISHA: (giggles) You quickly and as swiftly as
you can-- for a group of bears--

2023
02:31:14,174 --> 02:31:18,522
climb down the tree and dart 
and make your way into the front room.

2024
02:31:18,522 --> 02:31:21,590
SAM: I've got my stick. 
What do you want me to do?

2025
02:31:21,590 --> 02:31:24,073
MATT: Make sure you don't leave it behind. 
Might be handy.

2026
02:31:24,073 --> 02:31:28,197
SAM: I've got it. What do we do with this body?
Someone's going to see it!

2027
02:31:28,197 --> 02:31:36,493
MARISHA: You get the Flyer, get it in. 
You are now into the front tavern bar room

2028
02:31:36,493 --> 02:31:38,345
of the Sun Kissed Inn.

2029
02:31:38,345 --> 02:31:44,729
MATT: A valid point. The body of the guy who's
unconscious that he just crushed. I pick up the

2030
02:31:44,729 --> 02:31:52,084
body and look for the window of the balcony we
were just jumping down from and try and ragdoll

2031
02:31:52,084 --> 02:31:59,362
him up into it. (laughing) Arms and legs out.

2032
02:31:59,362 --> 02:32:01,985
LIAM: Full-on Red Dead Redemption.

2033
02:32:01,985 --> 02:32:10,516
MARISHA: Bear? I guess? I don't know.

2034
02:32:10,516 --> 02:32:13,979
BRIAN: That's totally something a bear would do.
Flinging a man through a window?

2035
02:32:13,979 --> 02:32:16,855
MATT: That was a six.

2036
02:32:16,855 --> 02:32:22,579
LIAM: His twisted pretzel body goes two miles,
floating five feet above the ground.

2037
02:32:22,579 --> 02:32:34,751
MARISHA: You miss, and it goes and lands on the
roof of the storage room next door.

2038
02:32:34,751 --> 02:32:36,400
MATT: Close enough.

2039
02:32:36,400 --> 02:32:39,396
(laughter)

2040
02:32:39,396 --> 02:32:47,001
MARISHA: It's not the most immediately visible
thing.

2041
02:32:47,001 --> 02:32:48,815
TALIESIN: No one looks up.

2042
02:32:48,815 --> 02:32:54,744
MATT: It's fine. Sweet dreams. Goes back to catch
up with them in the tavern.

2043
02:32:54,744 --> 02:32:56,809
BRIAN: He won't remember that.

2044
02:32:56,809 --> 02:33:10,647
MARISHA: You all are in the front room of the
tavern. It's the late afternoon. There's no one in

2045
02:33:10,647 --> 02:33:20,059
the tavern, anyway, especially now. There's one
really old guy passed out in the front right-hand

2046
02:33:20,059 --> 02:33:28,168
corner. Seems like he's been there probably since
last night. You hear a commotion and clanking of

2047
02:33:28,168 --> 02:33:33,118
pots and pans of chefs and workers in the back, in
the kitchen, getting things ready for the evening,

2048
02:33:33,118 --> 02:33:37,818
anticipating it will probably be a busy day in the
Hazel Festival.

2049
02:33:37,818 --> 02:33:39,344
TALIESIN: Do I smell honey in the kitchen?

2050
02:33:39,344 --> 02:33:42,091
MARISHA: Yeah.

2051
02:33:42,091 --> 02:33:44,421
SAM: There's honey everywhere in this town.

2052
02:33:44,421 --> 02:33:46,361
MARISHA: There is honey in there.

2053
02:33:46,361 --> 02:33:50,732
MATT: You, with the strange crazy eyes. 
Do you have any idea where the cellar is

2054
02:33:50,732 --> 02:33:52,536
here in the inn?

2055
02:33:52,536 --> 02:34:02,819
MARISHA: It is drowned out by the smell of a
stockroom of honey that is coming from the back

2056
02:34:02,819 --> 02:34:12,515
left-hand corner of the tavern, which is the
entrance to the pantry into the cellar. Guarding

2057
02:34:12,515 --> 02:34:21,144
that front initial doorway into the pantry, which
leads into the bottom cellar, is, with a pint in

2058
02:34:21,144 --> 02:34:24,492
his hand, a passed-out Grog.

2059
02:34:24,492 --> 02:34:26,574
SAM: Grog Strongjaw?

2060
02:34:26,574 --> 02:34:27,763
MARISHA: Grog.

2061
02:34:27,763 --> 02:34:37,073
TALIESIN: The Grog Strongjaw, of the Northampton
Strongjaws? I don't know why I went there.

2062
02:34:37,073 --> 02:34:43,836
MARISHA: The Herd. Technically of the Emon
Strongjaws?

2063
02:34:43,836 --> 02:34:48,140
LIAM: If one of us bears made a history check,
would we know who the fuck this guy is?

2064
02:34:48,140 --> 02:34:49,601
TALIESIN: He looks big.

2065
02:34:49,601 --> 02:34:51,690
MARISHA: Trinket recognizes him immediately.

2066
02:34:51,690 --> 02:34:59,859
SAM: I think I can-- excuse me, this is clearly a
panda bear. He's a skinnier version of me.

2067
02:34:59,859 --> 02:35:05,088
He's black and white. And I will go talk to him 
in Panda, and I will sort this all out.

2068
02:35:05,088 --> 02:35:10,643
MATT: While you're both probably on par
intellectually, I don't know

2069
02:35:10,643 --> 02:35:12,104
if that's going to end as--

2070
02:35:12,104 --> 02:35:16,649
SAM: He's furry. He's got a little fur. He's black
and white. He's my people.

2071
02:35:16,649 --> 02:35:25,398
MATT: Is he right in front of the door to the
pantry?

2072
02:35:25,398 --> 02:35:32,140
MARISHA: There's the bar, there's a door that goes
into the pantry, and then there's a little booth

2073
02:35:32,140 --> 02:35:40,244
and bar tables right off to the left of the door.
Looks like he was placed there, probably told to

2074
02:35:40,244 --> 02:35:46,762
watch out for people coming in and out of the
pantry, and proceeded to drink a lot and pass out

2075
02:35:46,762 --> 02:35:52,494
instead. He's in a little chair, propped up at a
bar table right to the left of the entrance,

2076
02:35:52,494 --> 02:35:55,528
snoring loudly. No what?

2077
02:35:55,528 --> 02:35:56,809
BRIAN: There's cards?

2078
02:35:56,809 --> 02:35:58,346
MARISHA: Cards? Oh!

2079
02:35:58,346 --> 02:36:05,502
MATT: We're going to keep this as plan C. 
Plan A: quietly make our way past.

2080
02:36:05,502 --> 02:36:09,191
TALIESIN: Quick question: which plan comes first?
Is it plan A or plan C?

2081
02:36:09,191 --> 02:36:10,517
MATT: Brains?

2082
02:36:10,517 --> 02:36:19,204
LIAM: I'm going to roll a d6, and I'll tell you.
Plan D comes first.

2083
02:36:19,204 --> 02:36:20,930
TALIESIN: That makes sense.

2084
02:36:20,930 --> 02:36:26,808
SAM: Why does no one value my opinions here?
I feel like I'm offering good ideas--

2085
02:36:26,808 --> 02:36:33,500
BRIAN: When we need you to push something over, 
to dip your balls in something--

2086
02:36:33,500 --> 02:36:37,660
SAM: I feel like I'm thinking outside the box
here, and no one's taking me seriously.

2087
02:36:37,660 --> 02:36:42,131
LIAM: Peddy, you don't make friends with salad. 
No offense. Trinket, this is your home turf.

2088
02:36:42,131 --> 02:36:43,753
I will follow your lead--

2089
02:36:43,753 --> 02:36:45,000
TALIESIN: I don't know what that means!

2090
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:46,216
MARISHA: I don't, either!

2091
02:36:46,216 --> 02:36:48,932
BRIAN: Vegetarian joke.

2092
02:36:48,932 --> 02:36:51,425
LIAM: He's a vegetarian. All he eats is bamboo. 
No one's going to respect that

2093
02:36:51,425 --> 02:36:52,941
in the bear community.

2094
02:36:52,941 --> 02:36:57,659
BRIAN: While they're doing this, I would like to
go right outside the tavern and see if I can

2095
02:36:57,659 --> 02:37:05,967
secure for us a getaway vehicle. Some type of mode
of transportation, faster than a de Rolo Roller.

2096
02:37:05,967 --> 02:37:14,969
MARISHA: Sure. As you peek out, there's a few
abandoned vegetable carts. People that were there

2097
02:37:14,969 --> 02:37:21,892
to sell their goods and their wares for the
festival. There's one that looks like it was a

2098
02:37:21,937 --> 02:37:31,726
pull-behind churro cart. And there is one cart
that still has a horse attached to it that looks

2099
02:37:31,795 --> 02:37:36,688
like at this point, he's eating all of the
vegetables that are completely unattended

2100
02:37:36,688 --> 02:37:38,450
right now, due to the pandemonium.

2101
02:37:38,450 --> 02:37:43,093
BRIAN: So there's no one around it? 
I will go secure that cart and bring it

2102
02:37:43,093 --> 02:37:44,570
to the entrance of the tavern.

2103
02:37:44,570 --> 02:37:46,056
MARISHA: Okay. How would you like to do that?

2104
02:37:46,056 --> 02:37:49,888
BRIAN: Am I still dressed up as a fucking
awesome-looking guy?

2105
02:37:49,888 --> 02:37:52,128
Like a young Jason Charles Miller?

2106
02:37:52,128 --> 02:37:54,862
MARISHA: Yeah. You totally look like a young Jason
Charles Miller.

2107
02:37:54,862 --> 02:37:58,319
TALIESIN: Does that mean that a young 
Jason Charles Miller looks like a honey badger

2108
02:37:58,319 --> 02:37:59,504
in a cowboy hat?

2109
02:37:59,504 --> 02:38:00,654
BRIAN: It sure does.

2110
02:38:00,654 --> 02:38:03,523
LIAM: I'm picturing a furry Great American Hero.

2111
02:38:03,523 --> 02:38:19,507
BRIAN: Yes! So I will cross the thoroughfare as
suavely and slovenly as I can, and then I will

2112
02:38:19,507 --> 02:38:23,331
approach the cart from the back so as not to
frighten the horse.

2113
02:38:23,331 --> 02:38:27,998
MARISHA: Okay. You see the same guard that was
walking by is currently pounding on the door.

2114
02:38:27,998 --> 02:38:34,417
You can hear him. On the door that you guys came
from that led up to the security room. You can

2115
02:38:34,417 --> 02:38:39,496
hear him going, "Chief? Boss man? Hello?"

2116
02:38:39,496 --> 02:38:48,690
BRIAN: How far away from me is he?

2117
02:38:48,690 --> 02:38:52,774
MARISHA: The guy? He's far enough away. He's not
paying any attention to you right now.

2118
02:38:52,774 --> 02:38:55,292
BRIAN: Does it look like he wants to go in there?

2119
02:38:55,292 --> 02:38:57,211
MARISHA: He's trying to get in, yeah.

2120
02:38:57,211 --> 02:39:02,736
BRIAN: All right. I'm going to go try to cut his
throat.

2121
02:39:02,736 --> 02:39:05,250
SAM: With what? With your claws?

2122
02:39:05,250 --> 02:39:10,663
BRIAN: I'm a fucking honey badger, bro. I'm going
to try to go from behind and silence him.

2123
02:39:10,663 --> 02:39:14,213
Yeah, man, put him in the cement boots.

2124
02:39:14,213 --> 02:39:18,222
MARISHA: That's fucking awesome. Roll for carnage.
You get advantage.

2125
02:39:18,222 --> 02:39:22,828
BRIAN: Success.

2126
02:39:22,828 --> 02:39:29,957
MARISHA: Without any hesitation, he doesn't even
know what came.

2127
02:39:29,957 --> 02:39:33,540
BRIAN: The honey's for me and my friends.

2128
02:39:33,540 --> 02:39:43,615
MARISHA: A theatrical amount of blood sprays on
the door in front, and he slowly drops, smears

2129
02:39:43,615 --> 02:39:47,404
down against the wall. He's dead.

2130
02:39:47,404 --> 02:39:48,888
BRIAN: Oh shit, he's dead?

2131
02:39:48,888 --> 02:39:50,173
MARISHA: He's definitely dead.

2132
02:39:50,173 --> 02:39:54,536
BRIAN: On the wall in the blood, I write, 
<i>Welcome to fabulous Las Vegas.</i>

2133
02:39:54,536 --> 02:39:59,648
(laughter)

2134
02:39:59,648 --> 02:40:01,621
MARISHA: Roll for criminal.

2135
02:40:01,621 --> 02:40:06,004
BRIAN: Again? Success.

2136
02:40:06,004 --> 02:40:08,942
MARISHA: You get a point from bear into criminal,
for sure.

2137
02:40:09,003 --> 02:40:15,612
LIAM: My criminal mastermind brain tells me that
this is your turf, Trink. I want to follow your

2138
02:40:15,612 --> 02:40:19,065
lead. I see recognition in your eyes. You don't
like this guy. What do we do?

2139
02:40:19,065 --> 02:40:26,597
MATT: No, I like the guy a lot, actually, but he
might like destroying you too much. We've got to

2140
02:40:26,597 --> 02:40:30,150
sneak past. Stay nice and quiet-like. Small guy
can probably get by fine when he catches up, but

2141
02:40:30,150 --> 02:40:32,177
we've got to quietly make our way.

2142
02:40:32,177 --> 02:40:34,747
TALIESIN: Is it a door or a gate? Can we see
past?

2143
02:40:34,747 --> 02:40:44,463
MARISHA: You know those stockrooms, how you have
an open half-door? You can see that there's a

2144
02:40:44,463 --> 02:40:52,962
walk-in pantry, and through the walk-in pantry,
there's a little cellar door. Wooden. It's got a

2145
02:40:52,962 --> 02:40:55,834
circular dowel rod across it.

2146
02:40:55,834 --> 02:40:57,346
TALIESIN: I can't see any honey?

2147
02:40:57,346 --> 02:40:59,992
MARISHA: No, but you know it's through that door.

2148
02:40:59,992 --> 02:41:02,054
TALIESIN: I've got an idea.

2149
02:41:02,054 --> 02:41:05,356
SAM: I've got an idea. That dowel rod looks like
bamboo. I'm going to eat it!

2150
02:41:05,356 --> 02:41:08,422
TALIESIN: You've got a tiny bottle of honey.

2151
02:41:08,422 --> 02:41:13,612
MARISHA: You can also smell a little bit of honey
coming from the pantry room, as well. Not a lot.

2152
02:41:13,612 --> 02:41:20,309
TALIESIN: You've got a tiny bottle of honey,
right? Wasn't someone given a teeny-tiny

2153
02:41:20,309 --> 02:41:21,357
bit of honey?

2154
02:41:21,357 --> 02:41:22,606
SAM: He's got armpit honey.

2155
02:41:22,606 --> 02:41:28,503
BRIAN: I've got it, but I'm not there yet. But
after I so beautifully and poetically murdered

2156
02:41:28,503 --> 02:41:32,401
that man in the street, can I move the cart to the
front of the tavern and rejoin them?

2157
02:41:32,401 --> 02:41:39,021
MARISHA: You can go over and take a little bit of
time, get some leftover vegetables, and lead the

2158
02:41:39,021 --> 02:41:45,425
horse, pulling the cart. These guys are figuring
this out while you're doing that.

2159
02:41:45,425 --> 02:41:55,246
MATT: I pull out a palm-full of pit honey that's
been smeared into my matted fur. I've got this.

2160
02:41:55,246 --> 02:42:01,648
TALIESIN: It'll do. I'm going to look around. Are
there cups or something around?

2161
02:42:01,648 --> 02:42:07,304
MARISHA: Yeah, there's a few, and there's a couple
of empty pint glasses on Grog's table.

2162
02:42:07,304 --> 02:42:10,358
TALIESIN: I put a little bit of the honey into the
empty pint.

2163
02:42:10,358 --> 02:42:14,689
MARISHA: (snores) "Yes, I am the Grand Poobah."

2164
02:42:14,689 --> 02:42:20,387
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and toss the cup past
Grog into the pantry.

2165
02:42:20,387 --> 02:42:22,266
SAM: To wake him up?

2166
02:42:22,266 --> 02:42:23,453
TALIESIN: Quietly.

2167
02:42:23,453 --> 02:42:24,878
MARISHA: You want to wake him up?

2168
02:42:24,878 --> 02:42:29,062
TALIESIN: No, I want to throw the cup into the
pantry. Will that wake him up?

2169
02:42:29,062 --> 02:42:34,365
MARISHA: Okay, you throw a cup. (crash, snorts)
"That's my ale."

2170
02:42:34,365 --> 02:42:41,250
TALIESIN: I'm going to stare at the cup I just
threw.

2171
02:42:41,250 --> 02:42:55,107
MARISHA: About this time, Waffle gets another
little nosebleed. Roll for it.

2172
02:42:55,107 --> 02:42:57,128
TALIESIN: I don't get advantage, I just have to
roll for it, right?

2173
02:42:57,128 --> 02:42:59,855
LIAM: Come on, Bear Eleven.

2174
02:42:59,855 --> 02:43:01,763
TALIESIN: One.

2175
02:43:01,763 --> 02:43:10,937
MARISHA: You see Waffle go, (sparking) and in a
hex techy-looking glow, he goes, (zap)

2176
02:43:10,937 --> 02:43:13,147
and teleports to the broken honey.

2177
02:43:13,147 --> 02:43:15,022
LIAM: In the pantry?

2178
02:43:15,022 --> 02:43:16,288
MARISHA: In the pantry.

2179
02:43:16,288 --> 02:43:21,584
MATT: All right, my turn. I focus really hard on
the broken honey--

2180
02:43:21,584 --> 02:43:24,139
SAM: No, you need a nosebleed. I hit him in the
nose.

2181
02:43:24,139 --> 02:43:30,132
MATT: That's good. (straining)

2182
02:43:30,132 --> 02:43:33,735
SAM: More blood!

2183
02:43:33,735 --> 02:43:37,284
MATT: Okay.

2184
02:43:37,284 --> 02:43:40,538
MARISHA: You go (boop) and squeeze out a little
turd.

2185
02:43:40,538 --> 02:43:46,293
SAM: Hey, you teleported that turd to the floor.

2186
02:43:46,293 --> 02:43:52,177
MARISHA: As you get a little aggravated, you take
a point in bear.

2187
02:43:52,177 --> 02:43:58,646
TALIESIN: I'm going to start figuring out if I can
open this pantry door. I'm quietly working the

2188
02:43:58,646 --> 02:44:00,418
pantry door to try and get downstairs.

2189
02:44:00,418 --> 02:44:06,560
MARISHA: It's got a thick dowel rod across it, and
it's got a chain on top of that, wrapping it up

2190
02:44:06,560 --> 02:44:08,063
for extra security.

2191
02:44:08,063 --> 02:44:09,749
TALIESIN: I didn't think much past this.

2192
02:44:09,749 --> 02:44:15,837
LIAM: Hold on, I've got this. I'm going to pick
this chain's lock.

2193
02:44:15,837 --> 02:44:26,937
MATT: We haven't walked past Grog yet, but you
know what? Our conversation hasn't woken him up

2194
02:44:26,937 --> 02:44:31,892
yet, and the breaking glass didn't wake him up.
Let's just walk through the room. He's pretty

2195
02:44:31,892 --> 02:44:34,175
drunk. All right, let's do that.

2196
02:44:34,175 --> 02:44:37,618
MARISHA: Yeah, make a stealthy...

2197
02:44:37,618 --> 02:44:45,511
MATT: Because I'm a thief, could I consider that
as a skill?

2198
02:44:45,511 --> 02:44:48,032
TALIESIN: Considering that bears can have very
stealthy picnics--

2199
02:44:48,032 --> 02:44:52,784
MARISHA: Let's make this a criminal roll. You're
criminally trying to sneak past Grog.

2200
02:44:52,784 --> 02:44:54,601
LIAM: Welcome to Criminal Roll!

2201
02:44:54,601 --> 02:44:57,150
MATT: Can I use my thief role to be stealthy?

2202
02:44:57,150 --> 02:44:59,018
MARISHA: Yeah. I'll allow it.

2203
02:44:59,018 --> 02:45:03,295
SAM: On the way past, I'm going to look 
and see if Grog has anything else on him

2204
02:45:03,295 --> 02:45:05,914
that we can see or take or use.

2205
02:45:05,914 --> 02:45:20,647
MARISHA: He does actually appear to be wearing
some sunglasses. Yeah. It seems a little odd. They

2206
02:45:20,647 --> 02:45:26,670
look like they were maybe festival glasses.
They're half hanging off his face right now.

2207
02:45:26,670 --> 02:45:28,213
SAM: I'll see if I can take them.

2208
02:45:28,213 --> 02:45:30,016
MARISHA: Okay, roll a criminal check.

2209
02:45:30,016 --> 02:45:32,458
SAM: Super fail.

2210
02:45:32,458 --> 02:45:37,421
BRIAN and MATT: (singing) Super fail, super fail.

2211
02:45:37,421 --> 02:45:38,911
MATT: (singing) He super fucked up.

2212
02:45:38,911 --> 02:45:51,298
MARISHA: As you get the glasses off his face, 
he goes, "Oh shit. It's a fuzzy goliath!"

2213
02:45:51,298 --> 02:45:54,188
And gets up.

2214
02:45:54,188 --> 02:45:55,773
SAM: I growl at him. (roars)

2215
02:45:55,773 --> 02:45:56,870
MARISHA: (roars) He growls back.

2216
02:45:56,870 --> 02:46:00,702
SAM and MARISHA: (roar)

2217
02:46:00,702 --> 02:46:02,296
MARISHA: "You want to wrestle?"

2218
02:46:02,296 --> 02:46:03,666
SAM: Yeah!

2219
02:46:03,666 --> 02:46:08,260
MARISHA: He's drunk, and he takes a big swing at
you.

2220
02:46:08,260 --> 02:46:10,683
SAM: I swing back.

2221
02:46:10,683 --> 02:46:15,892
MARISHA: Okay, roll a muscle roll. Roll with
advantage.

2222
02:46:15,892 --> 02:46:19,832
SAM: Fail. Success!

2223
02:46:19,832 --> 02:46:26,259
MARISHA: You successfully wrestle Grog. He's
pretty drunk. He's not too hard to get to the

2224
02:46:26,259 --> 02:46:29,689
ground. He's now on his back, squirming.

2225
02:46:29,689 --> 02:46:38,046
SAM: I speak to him in Panda: pan pan pan-pan. 
Pan pan pan pan? Pan pan da da da,

2226
02:46:38,046 --> 02:46:40,792
pa-pa-pan pan dan. Panda.

2227
02:46:40,792 --> 02:46:45,890
MARISHA: "Yes, I am Grand Poobah 
de Boink de Boink!"

2228
02:46:45,890 --> 02:46:47,624
SAM: Panda?

2229
02:46:47,624 --> 02:46:50,262
MARISHA: "You Poobah, too?"

2230
02:46:50,262 --> 02:46:51,603
SAM: Panda!

2231
02:46:51,603 --> 02:46:56,183
MARISHA: "Oh, brother!"

2232
02:46:56,183 --> 02:46:59,725
(fake sobbing)

2233
02:46:59,725 --> 02:47:02,511
LIAM: Cookie is picking the fuck out of the lock,
right now!

2234
02:47:02,511 --> 02:47:04,239
MARISHA: Try to pick the lock.

2235
02:47:04,239 --> 02:47:07,438
LIAM: Diddly-diddly-do! That is a fail.

2236
02:47:07,438 --> 02:47:13,472
BRIAN: How is my progress 
of leading a horse across the street, slowly,

2237
02:47:13,472 --> 02:47:15,500
by luring him with vegetables?

2238
02:47:15,500 --> 02:47:24,171
MARISHA: Pretty good. I'd say by this point, you
open the door to see Peddy on top of another guy

2239
02:47:24,171 --> 02:47:28,160
that looks kind of like a panda, and you're not
sure if it's bad or good.

2240
02:47:28,160 --> 02:47:33,232
LIAM: Marisha, what does the flashback do? If I
tell a flashback, it fixes that?

2241
02:47:33,232 --> 02:47:37,706
MARISHA: If you tell a flashback, you get to gain
a point into criminal.

2242
02:47:37,706 --> 02:47:40,000
LIAM: And then roll again?

2243
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:44,657
MATT: No, it just adjusts your skill points. You
still fail the roll.

2244
02:47:44,657 --> 02:47:46,352
LIAM: All right.

2245
02:47:46,352 --> 02:47:49,474
TALIESIN: I've got a plan to get us in this door.

2246
02:47:49,474 --> 02:47:55,965
MATT: What, are you having a problem again trying
to get into a place with a lock? Like I said, the

2247
02:47:55,965 --> 02:48:01,896
lady who raised me, she's pretty good at picking
this stuff, too. In fact-- and I reach over and

2248
02:48:01,896 --> 02:48:05,987
grab one of the little side bags they usually tie
to me to carry stuff, and I pull out one of the

2249
02:48:05,987 --> 02:48:12,934
lockpicks that Vex keeps stored on my side as a
backup. And with my dexterous thief Trinket giant

2250
02:48:12,934 --> 02:48:16,838
bear paws, try and maneuver these tiny little--

2251
02:48:16,838 --> 02:48:19,387
LIAM: Thin as a blade of grass.

2252
02:48:19,387 --> 02:48:26,790
MATT: It's like trying to hold a cup with boxing
gloves on. (grunts)

2253
02:48:26,790 --> 02:48:31,696
MARISHA: Countless hours, you have practiced in
the middle of the night, just trying to learn how

2254
02:48:31,696 --> 02:48:35,294
to pick a lock. Prove to us, Trinket, 
that you can.

2255
02:48:35,294 --> 02:48:36,721
MATT: Yes!

2256
02:48:36,721 --> 02:48:46,423
MARISHA: (clang) The whole thing snaps from the
inside, because you're a bear, but it successfully

2257
02:48:46,423 --> 02:48:48,037
goes (creak).

2258
02:48:48,037 --> 02:48:52,425
MATT: What did I tell you? Mommy taught me good.

2259
02:48:52,425 --> 02:49:04,947
MARISHA: About this time, Grog goes, "Poobah, I
missed you so--" (snores) and passes back out.

2260
02:49:04,947 --> 02:49:08,384
SAM: I put his sunglasses back on and pat him on
the head.

2261
02:49:08,384 --> 02:49:15,465
MARISHA: All right. You do get an interesting
essence from the sunglasses.

2262
02:49:15,465 --> 02:49:20,146
SAM: Oh? Do they have the same essence as the
stick, or something similar?

2263
02:49:20,146 --> 02:49:21,781
LIAM: Put them on your face, Peddy.

2264
02:49:21,781 --> 02:49:31,701
SAM: All right, I'll take them and put them on.
Try them on once. (giggles) Nice. I'm going to try

2265
02:49:31,701 --> 02:49:33,918
them on once. What do I see?

2266
02:49:33,918 --> 02:49:45,438
MARISHA: You look awesome. You see a bar, 
you see a tavern, and then right as you look past

2267
02:49:45,438 --> 02:49:51,109
the cellar: holy shit, you can see past that 
cellar door! You see tripwires!

2268
02:49:51,109 --> 02:49:52,812
SAM: What?

2269
02:49:52,812 --> 02:49:54,203
LIAM: Peddy, what are you doing?

2270
02:49:54,203 --> 02:50:00,224
SAM: I put on these human glasses, and I can see
through walls.

2271
02:50:00,224 --> 02:50:02,880
BRIAN: And all you had to do was dry-hump that guy
to get them?

2272
02:50:02,880 --> 02:50:04,293
SAM: I was not dry-humping him!

2273
02:50:04,293 --> 02:50:06,494
BRIAN: It looked like you were dry-humping him
when I walked in here.

2274
02:50:06,494 --> 02:50:07,964
LIAM: You can now, if you choose to.

2275
02:50:07,964 --> 02:50:11,917
SAM: Dry-hump him? No.

2276
02:50:11,917 --> 02:50:19,886
MARISHA: You turn and look over your shoulder
outside, out through the tavern exit, and you see

2277
02:50:19,886 --> 02:50:25,477
a dwarf-sized woman turn and swing open the door
of the tavern.

2278
02:50:25,477 --> 02:50:26,999
TALIESIN: We've got to move.

2279
02:50:26,999 --> 02:50:31,081
MARISHA: "Hey! I see you."

2280
02:50:31,081 --> 02:50:34,287
LIAM: Nobody move.

2281
02:50:34,287 --> 02:50:36,892
SAM: Humans can't see movement.

2282
02:50:36,892 --> 02:50:43,687
MARISHA: "I can see you, and I can understand 
what you're saying."

2283
02:50:43,687 --> 02:50:45,270
MATT: Wait, what?

2284
02:50:45,270 --> 02:50:46,413
BRIAN: But I didn't say anything.

2285
02:50:46,413 --> 02:50:48,527
TALIESIN: What number am I thinking of?

2286
02:50:48,527 --> 02:50:50,707
MARISHA: "I can hear you. I can't--"

2287
02:50:50,707 --> 02:50:52,503
TALIESIN: She can't hear us; it's fine.

2288
02:50:52,503 --> 02:50:57,820
SAM: Wait, humans can't see movement, but dwarves
can, I guess.

2289
02:50:57,820 --> 02:51:02,254
MARISHA: "That's not-- okay, what are you all
doing, all right?"

2290
02:51:02,254 --> 02:51:06,644
MATT: I go over. Do these still look functional?

2291
02:51:06,644 --> 02:51:13,332
MARISHA: "Where did you-- wait a second."

2292
02:51:13,332 --> 02:51:15,033
MATT: Do I recognize this?

2293
02:51:15,033 --> 02:51:20,198
MARISHA: You do. This is Tova, the werebear.

2294
02:51:20,198 --> 02:51:23,848
MATT: (moans)

2295
02:51:23,848 --> 02:51:26,516
MARISHA: "Okay. All right, big guy. All right."

2296
02:51:26,516 --> 02:51:31,170
LIAM: This is two years after the Chroma Conclave?
She lived!

2297
02:51:31,170 --> 02:51:36,076
MARISHA: This is the first time that you're seeing
her.

2298
02:51:36,076 --> 02:51:39,028
MATT: The only reason was because of that ring.

2299
02:51:39,028 --> 02:51:41,916
LIAM: (cheers)

2300
02:51:41,916 --> 02:51:49,968
MARISHA: She's wearing a nice slick suit. It's
very good. It's very clean-cut. Looks like she's

2301
02:51:49,968 --> 02:51:52,197
got a nice festive pin.

2302
02:51:52,197 --> 02:51:53,504
BRIAN: Is it all denim?

2303
02:51:53,504 --> 02:51:56,371
MARISHA: No, it's a nice wool. It's good.

2304
02:51:56,371 --> 02:51:58,194
MATT: You look good, Tova. Snazzy.

2305
02:51:58,194 --> 02:52:06,204
MARISHA: "You look good, too, Trinket. 
What do you think you're doing?"

2306
02:52:06,204 --> 02:52:09,092
MATT: It's a celebration in the city. We're
celebrating.

2307
02:52:09,092 --> 02:52:12,282
MARISHA: "I heard rumor that there's 
a bunch of bears running around.

2308
02:52:12,282 --> 02:52:13,945
"Of course it's Vex's dumb bear."

2309
02:52:13,945 --> 02:52:14,979
MATT: Hey!

2310
02:52:14,979 --> 02:52:21,836
MARISHA: "Well, look. What kind of trouble are you
getting into? You guys are going for the honey."

2311
02:52:21,836 --> 02:52:27,534
MATT: I mean, that's absurd. I'm offended,
personally.

2312
02:52:27,534 --> 02:52:29,683
BRIAN: To judge without any evidence.

2313
02:52:29,683 --> 02:52:33,068
MATT: Do you want a cut?

2314
02:52:33,068 --> 02:52:35,348
LIAM: Yeah, but just pretend like we were. 
Do you want in?

2315
02:52:35,348 --> 02:52:43,630
MARISHA: "Do I want-- (laughs) All right. 
You all clearly don't know who you're talking to

2316
02:52:43,630 --> 02:52:46,446
"and who you're getting involved with."

2317
02:52:46,446 --> 02:52:49,406
BRIAN: You just walked in five seconds ago.

2318
02:52:49,406 --> 02:52:56,676
MATT: I barely know you. We flirted in battle once,
and then you went away.

2319
02:52:56,676 --> 02:53:01,620
MARISHA: "All right, look! I am part 
of a super-secret society that is dedicated

2320
02:53:01,620 --> 02:53:06,697
"to protecting bears all across Tal'Dorei. 
One of the most decorated members.

2321
02:53:06,697 --> 02:53:12,107
"It's called the High Bear Nation, all right?" 
It's not bad, right?

2322
02:53:12,107 --> 02:53:19,332
"We take honey and other fruits and vegetables,
steal them from people who don't really need them,

2323
02:53:19,332 --> 02:53:22,948
"and make sure that bear families 
across all of Tal'Dorei are taken care of

2324
02:53:22,948 --> 02:53:24,753
"and never go without honey.

2325
02:53:24,753 --> 02:53:32,299
"Every year, this stupid Hazel Festival that they
always make me work security for, I decided

2326
02:53:32,299 --> 02:53:37,616
"I'm going to take all this leftover food 
that all these people always end up with:

2327
02:53:37,616 --> 02:53:42,567
"I'm going to take it for High Bear Nation. 
Give it to the bears who truly need it."

2328
02:53:42,567 --> 02:53:45,791
SAM: Wait a second, you're going to take all this
honey and give it away?

2329
02:53:45,791 --> 02:53:49,762
BRIAN: Give it away to a bunch of people that are
too lazy to get jobs?

2330
02:53:49,762 --> 02:53:51,566
LIAM: Don't we look needy?

2331
02:53:51,566 --> 02:53:57,227
MARISHA: "No, look. These are needy people, and
the High Bear Nation takes care of all of us,

2332
02:53:57,227 --> 02:54:00,038
"all right? I will get plenty of honey out of this."

2333
02:54:00,038 --> 02:54:05,801
MATT: All right, Beary Sanders. That honey is
for us and us alone. We've earned that, okay?

2334
02:54:05,801 --> 02:54:09,291
I don't want bears that haven't earned it 
getting a piece of what we've made.

2335
02:54:09,291 --> 02:54:12,890
LIAM: Yeah, are you pulling our legs? What is
this, a gingerhazing?

2336
02:54:12,890 --> 02:54:21,246
MARISHA: "You all put in work for this? I don't
think you guys understand. I was part of

2337
02:54:21,246 --> 02:54:25,832
"the planning committee to make sure 
that the security was all right.

2338
02:54:25,832 --> 02:54:33,227
"So here's the deal, since you all seem to have
gotten pretty far. The whole town's out looking

2339
02:54:33,227 --> 02:54:40,205
"for you; I can easily call one of the guards, 
turn you all in right now. Or you help me out.

2340
02:54:40,205 --> 02:54:43,980
"I could use extra hands to carry out 
some of this honey.

2341
02:54:43,980 --> 02:54:49,844
"You'll get your own little cut, and you'll all 
become members of the High Bear Nation."

2342
02:54:49,844 --> 02:54:51,940
SAM: What kind of cut are you talking about here?

2343
02:54:51,940 --> 02:54:55,976
MARISHA: "Enough to last you for a while. I know
how much honey is in there."

2344
02:54:55,976 --> 02:54:59,887
SAM: 50-50? 40-40? 30-30?

2345
02:54:59,887 --> 02:55:02,130
MARISHA: "That's not how--"

2346
02:55:02,130 --> 02:55:04,105
SAM: I'm not the brains of the operation.

2347
02:55:04,105 --> 02:55:07,836
(laughter)

2348
02:55:07,836 --> 02:55:12,838
MARISHA: "A good hogshead's worth for each of you.
How's that sound?"

2349
02:55:12,838 --> 02:55:15,516
BRIAN: Listen, from one extremely high bear to
another--

2350
02:55:15,516 --> 02:55:28,347
(laughter)

2351
02:55:28,347 --> 02:55:36,416
BRIAN: Can you guarantee safe passage, should we
choose to work with you in this endeavor?

2352
02:55:36,416 --> 02:55:38,909
SAM: It's always Bear-20 somewhere.

2353
02:55:38,909 --> 02:55:48,509
(snickering)

2354
02:55:48,509 --> 02:55:51,504
BRIAN: Oh, my makeup's running, and I didn't even
put any on.

2355
02:55:51,504 --> 02:55:53,536
MATT: Can you give us a minute to talk amongst
ourselves, privately?

2356
02:55:53,536 --> 02:55:57,241
MARISHA: "All right."

2357
02:55:57,241 --> 02:56:00,831
MATT: All right. Bears, huddle up.

2358
02:56:00,831 --> 02:56:03,247
BRIAN: I think she likes me for sure.

2359
02:56:03,247 --> 02:56:07,464
MATT: All right, what are our thoughts on this. Do
we want to share with her? We put all the work in.

2360
02:56:07,464 --> 02:56:10,458
It's not a lot of honey. We barely found that off
your--

2361
02:56:10,458 --> 02:56:13,539
LIAM: We already got a hogshead of honey in his
hat.

2362
02:56:13,539 --> 02:56:17,509
MATT: That'll last a meal. I don't think she
understands how hungry we are.

2363
02:56:17,509 --> 02:56:19,729
BRIAN: Yeah, and that one's big.

2364
02:56:19,729 --> 02:56:22,295
MATT: That one only eats bamboo.

2365
02:56:22,295 --> 02:56:27,967
BRIAN: Yeah, but should he switch and start to eat
honey, he could consume much of it.

2366
02:56:27,967 --> 02:56:32,566
SAM: I don't really care about the honey one way
or the other. Honestly, I'm fine just eating

2367
02:56:32,566 --> 02:56:38,342
bamboo, but I do feel like we put in the effort.
This is our heist. It's not hers. If she wants

2368
02:56:38,342 --> 02:56:43,984
to get cut in, we could give her maybe 
a thousand percent. I don't know numbers,

2369
02:56:43,984 --> 02:56:46,191
but a small amount.

2370
02:56:46,191 --> 02:56:50,039
MATT: I could always say, there's five of us 
and one of her.

2371
02:56:50,039 --> 02:56:52,482
If she helps us make our way in there--

2372
02:56:52,482 --> 02:56:54,822
BRIAN: I cut her throat--

2373
02:56:54,822 --> 02:56:59,293
MATT: Trust me, I've seen a lot of battles, 
and I haven't fallen in a single one.

2374
02:56:59,293 --> 02:57:03,910
(laughter)

2375
02:57:03,910 --> 02:57:09,667
MATT: We can take her, no problem. We leave her
tied up. Leave her a little hogshead of honey she

2376
02:57:09,667 --> 02:57:13,829
can take back to her bear friends, and then we
walk away scot-free.

2377
02:57:13,829 --> 02:57:17,657
SAM: As a vegan, I'm going to protest that we not
harm any living creatures.

2378
02:57:17,657 --> 02:57:21,384
MATT: Not harm, just knock unconscious and tie up,
like you've done to every other thing

2379
02:57:21,384 --> 02:57:22,492
we've come across.

2380
02:57:22,492 --> 02:57:27,137
SAM: That's okay. That is not harm. 
But heavens forbid we actually

2381
02:57:27,137 --> 02:57:29,237
kill a human being on this adventure.

2382
02:57:29,237 --> 02:57:32,904
MATT: Oh god, no. Unless they're evil or an
asshole or hurt my mom.

2383
02:57:32,904 --> 02:57:36,071
BRIAN: I did kill a human person, though.

2384
02:57:36,071 --> 02:57:39,086
SAM: Can you flash us back to that incident?

2385
02:57:39,086 --> 02:57:47,171
BRIAN: Well, it was 24 minutes ago, and I slit 
the throat of an innocent douchebag

2386
02:57:47,171 --> 02:57:48,969
who was knocking too loud.

2387
02:57:48,969 --> 02:57:51,787
SAM: Why would you kill an innocent person?

2388
02:57:51,787 --> 02:57:56,918
BRIAN: He nearly discovered all of you, and I
killed him.

2389
02:57:56,918 --> 02:57:59,105
SAM: I can't believe you. You're heartless.

2390
02:57:59,105 --> 02:58:09,749
BRIAN: I do what it takes. Everything I do, I do
it for the squad. Oh my god.

2391
02:58:09,749 --> 02:58:15,178
MARISHA: You get to put a point back into criminal
for that. From bear to criminal.

2392
02:58:15,178 --> 02:58:16,571
BRIAN: Me?

2393
02:58:16,571 --> 02:58:22,311
MATT: Are we agreed? Move forward as the squad,
tag her along, and then when all's said and done,

2394
02:58:22,311 --> 02:58:26,122
leave her behind with a bit of honey, and we move
away with the lion's share.

2395
02:58:26,122 --> 02:58:28,189
TALIESIN: Works for me.

2396
02:58:28,189 --> 02:58:34,205
MATT: All right, break! Tova, you've got yourself
a deal.

2397
02:58:34,205 --> 02:58:39,280
MARISHA: "Yeah? You an honest bear?"

2398
02:58:39,280 --> 02:58:41,568
MATT: Do I look like an honest bear?

2399
02:58:41,568 --> 02:58:43,437
MARISHA: "No."

2400
02:58:43,437 --> 02:58:45,945
BRIAN: Do I look like an honest bear?

2401
02:58:45,945 --> 02:58:48,729
MARISHA: "You look like a honey badger."

2402
02:58:48,729 --> 02:58:53,943
MATT: All right.

2403
02:58:53,943 --> 02:58:57,507
MARISHA: "Here's the deal: we're going to go
through these doors. There's going to be three

2404
02:58:57,507 --> 02:59:04,349
"tripwires. That's what they're called: tripwires.
There's also going to be a security cam in here.

2405
02:59:04,349 --> 02:59:06,596
"We want to be careful. They're watching us."

2406
02:59:06,596 --> 02:59:10,163
SAM: They're not watching us anymore.

2407
02:59:10,163 --> 02:59:13,347
TALIESIN: We've already taken care of the security
camera.

2408
02:59:13,347 --> 02:59:19,676
MARISHA: "Wow, that's pretty impressive. All
right, you guys are pretty good criminal bears.

2409
02:59:19,676 --> 02:59:23,854
"All right, these tripwires, though. Anyone good
at disarming? Yeah, we'll figure it out when we

2410
02:59:23,854 --> 02:59:34,048
"get in. Let's go." You throw open the door and
see a long hallway. Three haphazardly across the

2411
02:59:34,048 --> 02:59:40,050
hall tripwires. They're long, cylindrical,
glowing a bit green. You take a little bit of

2412
02:59:40,050 --> 02:59:51,667
dust, Liam Las Vegas, and they show up a little
bit better, then they go back to their dull,

2413
02:59:51,667 --> 02:59:55,722
transparent look, like fishing wire.

2414
02:59:55,722 --> 02:59:58,209
BRIAN: I don't like this one bit.

2415
02:59:58,209 --> 03:00:03,678
MATT: Does this look like the kind of thing that a
thief-trained bear who has seen thieves do their

2416
03:00:03,678 --> 03:00:06,373
work would have an inkling of how to disable it?

2417
03:00:06,373 --> 03:00:10,185
MARISHA: You can certainly try.

2418
03:00:10,185 --> 03:00:13,581
BRIAN: That sounds so familiar.

2419
03:00:13,581 --> 03:00:18,872
MARISHA: I tried to think up bear puns 
for all of our sayings, and I couldn't find

2420
03:00:18,872 --> 03:00:20,460
any natural ones.

2421
03:00:20,460 --> 03:00:23,082
MATT: The internet will barrage us with them when
we're done.

2422
03:00:23,082 --> 03:00:24,437
BRIAN: There's going to be a lot, yeah.

2423
03:00:24,437 --> 03:00:26,344
TALIESIN: There will be nothing on Twitter other
than bear puns.

2424
03:00:26,344 --> 03:00:30,480
MATT: I go back into the bag of thieves' tools
left over from Vex and pull out what I think might

2425
03:00:30,480 --> 03:00:37,290
work. I take a look at the mechanisms for the trip
wire. Two and a one.

2426
03:00:37,290 --> 03:00:43,890
MARISHA: Nice. Okay, you go up to the first one,
and you see an energy box off to the side. It's

2427
03:00:43,890 --> 03:00:53,383
got a washer keeping it closed. You tilt that to
the side, see the mechanical mechanism

2428
03:00:53,383 --> 03:00:59,317
on the inside. (pop)

2429
03:00:59,317 --> 03:01:04,565
MATT: I turn around with a big goofy smile.

2430
03:01:04,565 --> 03:01:09,357
MARISHA: You got through tripwire one. Two more
to go.

2431
03:01:09,357 --> 03:01:11,411
LIAM: Arcane magic dispelled.

2432
03:01:11,411 --> 03:01:17,959
MATT: Anyone have anything else they could help me
with on this?

2433
03:01:17,959 --> 03:01:20,814
SAM: I can grow a tree.

2434
03:01:20,814 --> 03:01:29,643
LIAM: Hold on. I walk up to it carefully,
gingerly, slowly. I piddle on it.

2435
03:01:29,643 --> 03:01:32,661
MARISHA: (sizzling)

2436
03:01:32,661 --> 03:01:35,008
TALIESIN: That's some hot pee, man.

2437
03:01:35,008 --> 03:01:38,744
LIAM: Nothing? I piddle on it again.

2438
03:01:38,744 --> 03:01:41,032
MARISHA: (weak sizzling)

2439
03:01:41,032 --> 03:01:43,150
LIAM: I really thought that would work.

2440
03:01:43,150 --> 03:01:44,952
SAM: Can't you hack this?

2441
03:01:44,952 --> 03:01:51,345
TALIESIN: I don't know. It looks a little weird. 
I can try and hack it.

2442
03:01:51,345 --> 03:01:53,756
MARISHA: You can try and hack it.

2443
03:01:53,756 --> 03:01:54,948
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and hack one.

2444
03:01:54,948 --> 03:01:57,456
MARISHA: All right, roll two.

2445
03:01:57,456 --> 03:02:01,763
MATT: Don't hack! You're going to be hacking an
actual tripwire.

2446
03:02:01,763 --> 03:02:05,216
TALIESIN: One.

2447
03:02:05,216 --> 03:02:13,003
MARISHA: It's got a little box. You go in. Instead
of messing with the mechanical trip wire, you see

2448
03:02:13,003 --> 03:02:15,293
almost a microchip on the inside.

2449
03:02:15,293 --> 03:02:17,638
TALIESIN: Can I find an off switch and click it?

2450
03:02:17,638 --> 03:02:20,311
MARISHA: You touch it, and it goes (zap).

2451
03:02:20,311 --> 03:02:21,725
TALIESIN: Hacked it.

2452
03:02:21,725 --> 03:02:23,113
SAM: Wow.

2453
03:02:23,113 --> 03:02:24,953
MARISHA: One more.

2454
03:02:24,953 --> 03:02:30,681
MATT: All right, I'll try for the third one. 
Get behind me. If anything goes bad,

2455
03:02:30,681 --> 03:02:33,744
tell Vex I love her.

2456
03:02:33,744 --> 03:02:37,355
BRIAN: But if it goes right, do the grin. 
We like that.

2457
03:02:37,355 --> 03:02:38,504
SAM: Who's Vax?

2458
03:02:38,504 --> 03:02:39,849
LIAM: Or Vex?

2459
03:02:39,849 --> 03:02:41,230
BRIAN: Who's Vax?

2460
03:02:41,230 --> 03:02:43,803
SAM: No, he said Vax. I think he wants us to tell
Vax--

2461
03:02:43,803 --> 03:02:45,971
BRIAN: We'll tell Vax that you love her.

2462
03:02:45,971 --> 03:02:55,130
MATT: Three.

2463
03:02:55,130 --> 03:02:59,957
MARISHA: All right. You and you take points in
criminal.

2464
03:02:59,957 --> 03:03:03,602
MATT: I turn around and look at the group with a
terrible happy-bear smile.

2465
03:03:03,602 --> 03:03:05,752
BRIAN: Yeah.

2466
03:03:05,752 --> 03:03:12,688
MARISHA: Tova's like, "All right. Good work." You
get down to the other end of the hall.

2467
03:03:12,688 --> 03:03:16,356
SAM: As we walk, I'm going to whisper to-- 
what's his name?

2468
03:03:16,356 --> 03:03:18,102
LIAM and TALIESIN: Cookie.

2469
03:03:18,102 --> 03:03:23,507
SAM: Hey, Cookie. I'm getting a bad feeling 
about this Tova chick.

2470
03:03:23,507 --> 03:03:26,680
Think she's going to double-cross us?

2471
03:03:26,680 --> 03:03:33,415
LIAM: You've got to prepare for the worst, my
friend. I need you to be ready. If she makes a

2472
03:03:33,415 --> 03:03:40,096
move, you're sitting on her. She doesn't breathe.
She's breathing in black-and-white ass hair.

2473
03:03:40,096 --> 03:03:42,750
Your ass hair. I need you to be ready.

2474
03:03:42,750 --> 03:03:45,621
SAM: All right. What's the signal? I need
signals.

2475
03:03:45,621 --> 03:03:50,516
LIAM: Steveland Cleamer.

2476
03:03:50,516 --> 03:03:52,596
SAM: Steveland Cleamer?

2477
03:03:52,596 --> 03:03:53,904
LIAM: Steveland Cleamer.

2478
03:03:53,904 --> 03:03:55,678
SAM: Nice and cleaned.

2479
03:03:55,678 --> 03:03:58,179
BRIAN: No, not that. Remember the picture you drew
last time.

2480
03:03:58,179 --> 03:04:04,617
LIAM: Let's bring it home.

2481
03:04:04,617 --> 03:04:08,459
TALIESIN: Let's see the spoils of our work.

2482
03:04:08,459 --> 03:04:10,622
MATT: What happens with the tripwires?

2483
03:04:10,622 --> 03:04:16,090
MARISHA: You get to the other end of the hall,
unharmed by a swarm of bees. That's what would

2484
03:04:16,090 --> 03:04:18,026
have happened if you would've tripped them.

2485
03:04:18,026 --> 03:04:20,576
BRIAN: We would've given them <i>that</i> honey, 
that's for sure.

2486
03:04:20,576 --> 03:04:27,491
MARISHA: You get to the other end of the hall, and
there's a hex-shaped door that's closed in front,

2487
03:04:27,491 --> 03:04:34,576
and right off to the right of it is a large
pedestal made out of bluish marble,

2488
03:04:34,576 --> 03:04:39,817
and there's a recess in the middle 
of this pedestal, making a bowl.

2489
03:04:39,817 --> 03:04:44,083
There are also four little baskets on either side.

2490
03:04:44,083 --> 03:04:46,343
LIAM: Are there any Skittles in it?

2491
03:04:46,343 --> 03:04:47,881
MARISHA: No.

2492
03:04:47,881 --> 03:04:48,875
SAM: Any honey?

2493
03:04:48,875 --> 03:04:52,437
MATT: Wait, remember that piece of paper that we
got from that guy earlier?

2494
03:04:52,437 --> 03:04:56,024
BRIAN: Buford. Bloomford.

2495
03:04:56,024 --> 03:04:57,132
MATT: Sure.

2496
03:04:57,132 --> 03:04:59,333
LIAM: Honestly, I'm only thinking about honey.

2497
03:04:59,333 --> 03:05:00,758
TALIESIN: It's really about honey.

2498
03:05:00,758 --> 03:05:08,830
MATT: I can't read. Tova?

2499
03:05:08,830 --> 03:05:11,825
MARISHA: "Okay. Yeah, sure."

2500
03:05:11,825 --> 03:05:14,515
SAM: Wait, are we sure we want to share this with
her?

2501
03:05:14,515 --> 03:05:17,815
MATT: She's a partner in this. 
She's getting an equal--

2502
03:05:17,815 --> 03:05:20,278
she's getting all the share we promised her.

2503
03:05:20,278 --> 03:05:24,391
MARISHA: "I already know what it is. I helped them
to design it. I just don't know the actual code

2504
03:05:24,391 --> 03:05:30,272
"they ended up going with. Here, look." She goes
over to it, and she passes her hand over it, and

2505
03:05:30,272 --> 03:05:40,152
it goes (buzzing) and starts glowing, and then
holographic fish appear in the center of it.

2506
03:05:40,152 --> 03:05:43,848
LIAM: Madness coming out.

2507
03:05:43,848 --> 03:05:48,773
SAM: What is this?

2508
03:05:48,773 --> 03:05:56,312
TALIESIN: Oh my god. What is wrong with you?!

2509
03:05:56,312 --> 03:05:58,839
BRIAN: This is the greatest thing I've ever seen
in my life.

2510
03:05:58,839 --> 03:06:03,049
SAM: Do we need these?

2511
03:06:03,049 --> 03:06:04,686
MARISHA: You will.

2512
03:06:04,686 --> 03:06:08,422
MATT: All right, should I read this out loud?

2513
03:06:08,422 --> 03:06:09,499
MARISHA: Yeah.

2514
03:06:09,499 --> 03:06:11,823
MATT: Via Tova reading this to me.

2515
03:06:11,823 --> 03:06:13,811
MARISHA: Yeah, I help him sound it out.

2516
03:06:13,811 --> 03:06:15,539
SAM: You guys have to share one.

2517
03:06:15,539 --> 03:06:18,492
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm into it.

2518
03:06:18,492 --> 03:06:21,854
MATT: Here, you guys should do this. You're the
brains.

2519
03:06:21,854 --> 03:06:23,397
BRIAN: Matt and I will share this one.

2520
03:06:23,397 --> 03:06:34,005
MATT: 'Green, pink, orange, and yellow. Not every
fish is a friendly fellow. Green is mean and pink

2521
03:06:34,005 --> 03:06:45,611
'stinks. Yellow is mellow, but orange is-- orange
is-- screw it. That Hazel Festival committeewoman

2522
03:06:45,611 --> 03:06:53,196
'can go to hell. I'm not a fucking riddle writer.
Here's the code: orange is the best color, so put

2523
03:06:53,196 --> 03:07:00,100
'one orange fish in each basket, except for two in
the pink. Heh, that one was my idea.'

2524
03:07:00,100 --> 03:07:02,647
(laughter)

2525
03:07:02,647 --> 03:07:08,306
MATT: 'Then the stupid, expensive-- '
I'm so proud I married you.

2526
03:07:08,306 --> 03:07:10,352
BRIAN: Hell yeah.

2527
03:07:10,352 --> 03:07:14,699
MATT: 'Then the stupid, expensive door should open.
Don't know why we're spending this much to lock up

2528
03:07:14,699 --> 03:07:19,299
'a few jars of honey, anyway. 
Signed, Buford T. Justice, head of security.'

2529
03:07:19,299 --> 03:07:24,808
MARISHA: As you say this, Tova puts her hand over
again.

2530
03:07:24,808 --> 03:07:28,859
(electronic song in Korean)

2531
03:07:28,859 --> 03:07:31,017
LIAM: An orange in each, except for two in the
pink, right?

2532
03:07:31,017 --> 03:07:33,001
MATT: An orange in each, except for two in the
pink.

2533
03:07:33,001 --> 03:07:37,826
MARISHA: Wait! Someone has to wear 
the bear hands, because I made them get them,

2534
03:07:37,826 --> 03:07:39,508
so it's even funnier.

2535
03:07:39,508 --> 03:07:45,176
MATT: Taliesin, I think you should only get them
if you have the bear hands on.

2536
03:07:45,176 --> 03:07:47,704
MARISHA: One at a time. You've got to have the
bear hands.

2537
03:07:47,704 --> 03:07:50,664
MATT: An orange in each basket.

2538
03:07:50,664 --> 03:07:53,526
LIAM: And two in the pink.

2539
03:07:53,526 --> 03:07:55,365
BRIAN: You've got it!

2540
03:07:55,365 --> 03:07:56,851
MARISHA: Yay!

2541
03:07:56,851 --> 03:07:58,244
BRIAN: An orange in each...

2542
03:07:58,244 --> 03:08:07,214
TALIESIN: What the hell are they singing?

2543
03:08:07,214 --> 03:08:09,761
MARISHA: I got it from South Korea.

2544
03:08:09,761 --> 03:08:15,166
SAM: Any guards coming?

2545
03:08:15,166 --> 03:08:17,327
MARISHA: No. No guards.

2546
03:08:17,327 --> 03:08:18,746
SAM: We have unlimited time?

2547
03:08:18,746 --> 03:08:21,569
MARISHA: He looped the footage. He did pretty
good.

2548
03:08:21,569 --> 03:08:28,688
LIAM: Two oranges in the pink and one in every
other one.

2549
03:08:28,688 --> 03:08:32,769
BRIAN: Oh god. What do I need?

2550
03:08:32,769 --> 03:08:36,041
MARISHA: Oh! No, he's out!

2551
03:08:36,041 --> 03:08:38,509
MATT: Oh god.

2552
03:08:38,509 --> 03:08:44,233
SAM: Oh! Las Vegas, come on! Focus!

2553
03:08:44,233 --> 03:08:47,338
BRIAN: I'm trying, man. I've got fucking bear
hands.

2554
03:08:47,338 --> 03:08:52,826
MATT: One more orange for the pink. Is that all we
need?

2555
03:08:52,826 --> 03:08:56,945
SAM: Come on, you damn wolverine. Get the thing!

2556
03:08:56,945 --> 03:08:58,867
BRIAN: I'm waiting for one to open.

2557
03:08:58,867 --> 03:09:02,830
MATT: Las Vegas, you can do this!

2558
03:09:02,830 --> 03:09:10,405
BRIAN: Goddamn, it's not opening its mouth!

2559
03:09:10,405 --> 03:09:20,213
MARISHA: Okay, as you start getting irritated, you
get a point in bear, Liam Las Vegas.

2560
03:09:20,213 --> 03:09:26,429
TALIESIN: I have never been so proud of you.

2561
03:09:26,429 --> 03:09:31,159
SAM: Oh, yeah. It's the fishing rod 
that's doing it.

2562
03:09:31,159 --> 03:09:32,834
BRIAN: This thing is warped!

2563
03:09:32,834 --> 03:09:34,909
TALIESIN: Why do I always get a warped one?

2564
03:09:34,909 --> 03:09:37,009
LIAM: Too much crystal honey in Vegas, Liam.

2565
03:09:37,009 --> 03:09:40,208
(groaning)

2566
03:09:40,208 --> 03:09:41,944
TALIESIN: You're a disappointment to everybody.

2567
03:09:41,944 --> 03:09:44,419
MARISHA: Come on, Liam Las Vegas. It's got to be
orange.

2568
03:09:44,419 --> 03:09:48,377
LIAM: Liam, you fucking asshole!

2569
03:09:48,377 --> 03:09:53,458
SAM: I'm getting so frustrated that I'm going to
start freaking out and hitting the doors.

2570
03:09:53,458 --> 03:09:57,038
MARISHA: Oh, the doors behind? Take a point in
bear.

2571
03:09:57,038 --> 03:10:00,202
BRIAN: None of them are opening!

2572
03:10:00,202 --> 03:10:04,032
MATT: In the pink!

2573
03:10:04,032 --> 03:10:05,374
LIAM: Two in the pink!

2574
03:10:05,374 --> 03:10:06,874
(cheering)

2575
03:10:06,874 --> 03:10:13,904
MARISHA: And with that, the hex-shaped doors 
open up.

2576
03:10:13,904 --> 03:10:16,866
LIAM: You mad bastard.

2577
03:10:16,866 --> 03:10:18,858
BRIAN: Damn. That was hard, man.

2578
03:10:18,858 --> 03:10:32,542
MARISHA: And behind the doors-- big mystery.
Where's the mystery? Mysterious. Yeah, that's

2579
03:10:32,542 --> 03:10:45,417
good. Behind the door, you see a dimly lit cellar
room. A waft of cool air blasts by you. You see a

2580
03:10:45,417 --> 03:10:52,720
few bar tables that have been tossed over; clearly
left in here for storage. A few bags of

2581
03:10:52,720 --> 03:10:59,442
grain. And in the middle, on discarded bar
tables-- there are three tables. The first one has

2582
03:10:59,442 --> 03:11:08,912
a little note that says "Slayer's Cake." It's got
a nice couple of small half-barrels of honey. The

2583
03:11:08,912 --> 03:11:13,365
second one says "Reginald's daughter." Whatever
her name is. Has a note.

2584
03:11:13,365 --> 03:11:15,466
MATT: It might have been Amelia.

2585
03:11:15,466 --> 03:11:20,446
MARISHA: I think it was. Something like that.
Ariana? Whatever. Third one.

2586
03:11:20,446 --> 03:11:25,070
MATT: The writing isn't very good. The name begins
with an A and then scribbles.

2587
03:11:25,070 --> 03:11:39,112
MARISHA: In scribbled red lettering, says
"Victor." And there's so much honey in actual boar

2588
03:11:39,112 --> 03:11:47,114
heads that's oozing out. Some's dripping off the
side of the table, and then you follow the drip

2589
03:11:47,114 --> 03:12:00,645
down and see more hogs' heads, goat heads. You see a
bear head. Pretty much looks like any type of head

2590
03:12:00,645 --> 03:12:10,346
he could find, he got it and put gray, ichor-y,
sulfuric-smelling honey.

2591
03:12:10,346 --> 03:12:22,373
You see four torch sconces on the walls, lightly
puttering. You follow, and you see, holy shit!

2592
03:12:22,373 --> 03:12:32,702
Victor brought way too much fucking honey, and the
entire edge of the cellar room is filled with

2593
03:12:32,702 --> 03:12:35,350
weird heads of honey.

2594
03:12:35,350 --> 03:12:41,462
LIAM: Waffle, this is it. This is our father's
dream.

2595
03:12:41,462 --> 03:12:43,966
TALIESIN: Everything we've worked for.

2596
03:12:43,966 --> 03:12:46,708
LIAM: We have reached easy street.

2597
03:12:46,708 --> 03:12:53,159
TALIESIN: It's all honey from here on out. 
Just honey. Everything.

2598
03:12:53,159 --> 03:12:55,739
MATT: How are those sconces looking?

2599
03:12:55,739 --> 03:12:57,722
MARISHA: Precarious.

2600
03:12:57,722 --> 03:13:01,014
MATT: What's in them? Is it magical light?

2601
03:13:01,014 --> 03:13:11,819
MARISHA: Nope, it looks like torch sconces that
they dipped in kerosene. A long-burning torch;

2602
03:13:11,819 --> 03:13:17,442
they probably lit them when they were bringing in
the honey, and then walked out.

2603
03:13:17,442 --> 03:13:21,974
MATT: Do any of them look viably close to dropping
embers?

2604
03:13:21,974 --> 03:13:29,064
MARISHA: There is one that's right over the table
of Victor's that looks like it's a miracle it

2605
03:13:29,064 --> 03:13:31,969
hasn't honestly exploded yet.

2606
03:13:31,969 --> 03:13:36,081
TALIESIN: Let's grab the honey and run.

2607
03:13:36,081 --> 03:13:39,579
BRIAN: I've got a cart outside waiting, with a
horse and everything.

2608
03:13:39,579 --> 03:13:45,819
MATT: Code Sad Bear! We've got to move <i>now</i>.

2609
03:13:45,819 --> 03:13:48,227
TALIESIN: I'm grabbing honey.

2610
03:13:48,227 --> 03:13:50,193
BRIAN: Is Tova still with us?

2611
03:13:50,193 --> 03:13:56,935
MARISHA: Tova is. She sees the same thing. She's a
little confused as to why you're acting this way.

2612
03:13:56,935 --> 03:14:00,963
MATT: I turn around to her. Tova, all this gray
honey shit is explosive.

2613
03:14:00,963 --> 03:14:02,065
MARISHA: "What?"

2614
03:14:02,065 --> 03:14:03,672
MATT: I know! He's crazy.

2615
03:14:03,672 --> 03:14:06,241
MARISHA: "Why? Why would you-- 
who would do that?"

2616
03:14:06,241 --> 03:14:10,581
MATT: The more you try and question his motives,
the more he makes you more like him. Keep going.

2617
03:14:10,581 --> 03:14:13,103
MARISHA: She walks over, takes a little.

2618
03:14:13,103 --> 03:14:20,424
MATT: I immediately take the fire staff I've been
carrying and throw it as far as I can

2619
03:14:20,424 --> 03:14:22,934
down the opposite hallway, away from this room.

2620
03:14:22,934 --> 03:14:29,852
MARISHA: "Okay, let's go!" And she starts scooping
up honey and throwing them into the Radio Flyer.

2621
03:14:29,852 --> 03:14:32,055
De Rolo Roller.

2622
03:14:32,055 --> 03:14:34,866
BRIAN: Blah-blah-blah.

2623
03:14:34,866 --> 03:14:47,625
MATT: Actually, while this is happening, I reach
over and go: Hey, Cookie. If I buy you a new hat,

2624
03:14:47,625 --> 03:14:49,292
could I borrow yours?

2625
03:14:49,292 --> 03:14:50,944
LIAM: Fuck yeah.

2626
03:14:50,944 --> 03:14:54,928
BRIAN: (singing) If you want to see paradise...

2627
03:14:54,928 --> 03:15:06,264
MATT: I'm going to take the top hat and place it
just over the heavy collection of Victor's honey

2628
03:15:06,264 --> 03:15:08,805
beneath where the sconce is.

2629
03:15:08,805 --> 03:15:12,894
MARISHA: Okay. Are you still wearing the
sunglasses, Peddy?

2630
03:15:12,894 --> 03:15:15,264
SAM: Of course.

2631
03:15:15,264 --> 03:15:20,815
MARISHA: You get a little bit of an advantage,
because at this time, you look up, and you see

2632
03:15:20,815 --> 03:15:26,165
through the roof of the cellar very quick,
shadowed movement.

2633
03:15:26,165 --> 03:15:29,758
SAM: Someone's above us.

2634
03:15:29,758 --> 03:15:34,961
TALIESIN: We'd better move. I'm going to create 
a distraction. Let's get this honey

2635
03:15:34,961 --> 03:15:36,449
out into the cart right now.

2636
03:15:36,449 --> 03:15:38,605
MATT: All right, moving honey as fast as we can
into the cart.

2637
03:15:38,605 --> 03:15:44,084
LIAM: Also, while we're moving, I'm going to take
a big fucking bite of honey on the move.

2638
03:15:44,084 --> 03:15:45,823
MARISHA: Put a point back into bear.

2639
03:15:45,823 --> 03:15:49,309
TALIESIN: I'm going to do the same, as well.

2640
03:15:49,309 --> 03:15:51,484
BRIAN: While they're doing that, I'm going to move
some honey onto the thing, and I'm going to wink

2641
03:15:51,484 --> 03:15:54,116
at Tova and say: I thought I told you that we
won't stop.

2642
03:15:54,116 --> 03:16:10,578
MARISHA: She goes, "Smooth." About this time,
(thud) and through the floorboards from above,

2643
03:16:10,578 --> 03:16:21,814
they splinter, and from the other side, and two
bears in black gis and ninja masks fall through.

2644
03:16:21,814 --> 03:16:32,467
Liam, you look over your shoulder. Las Vegas. And
around the corner are two more bears coming in

2645
03:16:32,467 --> 03:16:39,349
through the hall that you all just entered, too.
Tova looks up, she sees them, and she goes,

2646
03:16:39,349 --> 03:16:42,312
"Shit, it's the Bearracuda!"

2647
03:16:42,312 --> 03:16:43,473
BRIAN: They're not with you?

2648
03:16:43,473 --> 03:16:47,453
(groaning)

2649
03:16:47,453 --> 03:16:52,689
MATT: I immediately glance around. They came
through the ceiling; are there any of the sconces

2650
03:16:52,689 --> 03:16:54,865
that look close to being--

2651
03:16:54,865 --> 03:17:01,677
MARISHA: Yes, there's one on the left closest to
the door. Fractured and got knocked over by one of

2652
03:17:01,677 --> 03:17:06,981
the splintering floorboards and is now swinging
above all of the honey.

2653
03:17:06,981 --> 03:17:12,366
MATT: We can't-- and I point to the ninja bears
coming our way and the ones that just entered--

2654
03:17:12,366 --> 03:17:20,721
Handle it! And I go for the swinging sconce board
to see if I can clap it out with my bear paws and

2655
03:17:20,721 --> 03:17:22,250
put out the flame.

2656
03:17:22,250 --> 03:17:24,332
MARISHA: Okay, roll for bear.

2657
03:17:24,332 --> 03:17:28,533
BRIAN: Am I able to get the cart of honey--

2658
03:17:28,533 --> 03:17:29,760
MATT: Nope!

2659
03:17:29,760 --> 03:17:37,725
MARISHA: Unfortunately, as you try to stamp it out
with the board, the other floorboard catches on

2660
03:17:37,725 --> 03:17:40,504
fire, and now you have two flame sources.

2661
03:17:40,504 --> 03:17:48,773
BRIAN: Can I start trying to make it out with the
de Rolo Roller to the cart? Take the honey out?

2662
03:17:48,773 --> 03:17:50,353
TALIESIN: I've got this, guys!

2663
03:17:50,353 --> 03:17:56,661
MARISHA: As you try to roll it out, you have two
bear ninjas swiping above you. What do you do?

2664
03:17:56,661 --> 03:18:03,951
BRIAN: I try to run past them as fast as I can,
and if one of them gets too close to me, I can try

2665
03:18:03,951 --> 03:18:05,532
to swipe him on my way past.

2666
03:18:05,532 --> 03:18:10,069
MARISHA: Okay, use your nimble bear abilities 
as a honey badger. Straight bear roll.

2667
03:18:10,069 --> 03:18:11,382
BRIAN: Oh, just one?

2668
03:18:11,382 --> 03:18:12,511
MARISHA: Yeah.

2669
03:18:12,511 --> 03:18:14,458
BRIAN: That's a fail.

2670
03:18:14,458 --> 03:18:22,768
MARISHA: Okay, one of them gets a good slap on
you. Bounce off the wall. You get aggravated.

2671
03:18:22,768 --> 03:18:24,296
Point into bear.

2672
03:18:24,296 --> 03:18:30,212
SAM: I'm going to go for one of the ninjas and
attack with my strength. Panda strength.

2673
03:18:30,212 --> 03:18:31,951
MARISHA: Okay, roll with advantage.

2674
03:18:31,951 --> 03:18:34,528
SAM: That's a success. That's not.

2675
03:18:34,528 --> 03:18:41,641
MARISHA: You take the first one, and you sandwich
him with your weight up against the wall.

2676
03:18:41,641 --> 03:18:46,546
He's trying to fight you off.

2677
03:18:46,546 --> 03:18:48,912
SAM: As he's there, I hit him with the tree
stick.

2678
03:18:48,912 --> 03:18:52,659
MARISHA: Okay, roll for criminal to use the
stick.

2679
03:18:52,659 --> 03:18:55,047
SAM: No.

2680
03:18:55,047 --> 03:19:02,975
MARISHA: Okay. Unfortunately, as you're sandwiched
up against him when you try to use it, you don't

2681
03:19:02,975 --> 03:19:09,068
really get good leverage, so you go (bop) with a
dead stick. It doesn't really work. It's still

2682
03:19:09,068 --> 03:19:10,575
forcing against you.

2683
03:19:10,575 --> 03:19:13,135
BRIAN: Not your first time dealing with a dead
stick, is it, Peddy?

2684
03:19:13,135 --> 03:19:22,527
MARISHA: Tova reaches in the back of her suit, and
she pulls out a little throwing hammer. Throws it.

2685
03:19:22,527 --> 03:19:30,595
Let me roll for Tova. Tries and succeeds. 
Hits the first ninja; it gets a little distracted.

2686
03:19:30,595 --> 03:19:36,884
What are you guys doing? You've got the ninjas 
kind of warded off. Two more coming in

2687
03:19:36,884 --> 03:19:41,309
from where they were after Liam Las Vegas.

2688
03:19:41,309 --> 03:19:44,065
BRIAN: Have they abandoned me, so I can keep going
and try to get the cart outside?

2689
03:19:44,065 --> 03:19:45,668
MARISHA: Yeah, they're not too distracted 
with you.

2690
03:19:45,668 --> 03:19:48,860
BRIAN: Okay, so I'm going to keep pushing the de
Rolo Roller out to the thing and load the honey

2691
03:19:48,860 --> 03:19:50,365
into the cart.

2692
03:19:50,365 --> 03:19:56,947
MATT: Knowing that upstairs is Grog, two people
that we've knocked out, another drunk guy who's

2693
03:19:56,947 --> 03:20:00,975
passed out in the bar, and god knows who's nearby,
and the amount of Victor honey that's in here, I'm

2694
03:20:00,975 --> 03:20:02,719
focusing on trying to put the fires out.

2695
03:20:02,719 --> 03:20:04,617
MARISHA: Okay, roll again.

2696
03:20:04,617 --> 03:20:11,849
SAM: Are you going to pee on the fire?

2697
03:20:11,849 --> 03:20:22,037
MATT: Yeah. I'm one of the few that hasn't peed,
so I probably have a full tank. My paws are

2698
03:20:22,037 --> 03:20:28,758
scalded from patting the flames out. I lean back
and try and get as much of an arc as I can.

2699
03:20:28,758 --> 03:20:34,496
MARISHA: Okay, yeah. Roll for bear.

2700
03:20:34,496 --> 03:20:36,249
SAM and MATT: That's a bear thing.

2701
03:20:36,249 --> 03:20:39,415
MATT: No. That's a four.

2702
03:20:39,415 --> 03:20:41,614
MARISHA: Unfortunately, as you--

2703
03:20:41,614 --> 03:20:43,071
MATT: Performance anxiety!

2704
03:20:43,071 --> 03:20:46,376
TALIESIN: Are you pee shy?

2705
03:20:46,376 --> 03:20:48,496
MATT: Trinket apparently is pee shy.

2706
03:20:48,496 --> 03:21:00,024
MARISHA: You back up, and as you back up, you bump
into the table of Victor's honey, and it goes

2707
03:21:00,024 --> 03:21:06,579
(crash) and spills flammable honey 
all across the floor.

2708
03:21:06,579 --> 03:21:07,961
MATT: Sorry!

2709
03:21:07,961 --> 03:21:11,452
SAM: This is not going well!

2710
03:21:11,452 --> 03:21:16,339
MARISHA: The other two Bearracudas come in,
squaring off.

2711
03:21:16,339 --> 03:21:22,575
LIAM: Fuck this! Come here, you. Everybody run!
And I head towards the Bearracudas.

2712
03:21:22,575 --> 03:21:23,685
MARISHA: Okay.

2713
03:21:23,685 --> 03:21:27,843
LIAM: Let's fucking do this.

2714
03:21:27,843 --> 03:21:29,161
MARISHA: Roll for bear attack.

2715
03:21:29,161 --> 03:21:31,942
LIAM: Yes.

2716
03:21:31,942 --> 03:21:38,797
MARISHA: All right, you take one of them. Two big
haymaker swipes. They try to block with their bear

2717
03:21:38,797 --> 03:21:44,615
katanas and miss, and he gets two big gashes right
across his face. He's a little disoriented. You've

2718
03:21:44,615 --> 03:21:47,523
got one more that's in there. He's pretty
unattended.

2719
03:21:47,523 --> 03:21:52,821
TALIESIN: I have something I can do, but it's not
going to be pretty.

2720
03:21:52,821 --> 03:21:54,061
SAM: Let's do it.

2721
03:21:54,061 --> 03:21:55,891
LIAM: Waffle, hack the system!

2722
03:21:55,891 --> 03:22:03,473
TALIESIN: I take the fez of honey, and I throw it
at the Bearracuda.

2723
03:22:03,473 --> 03:22:06,686
MARISHA: Roll for bear.

2724
03:22:06,686 --> 03:22:09,640
TALIESIN: No.

2725
03:22:09,640 --> 03:22:10,854
MARISHA: No?

2726
03:22:10,854 --> 03:22:17,477
TALIESIN: No. I don't know what not throwing 
a hat full of honey looks like.

2727
03:22:17,477 --> 03:22:27,134
MARISHA: You try to get a nice overhand, but it
slips a little bit, and you have this weird,

2728
03:22:27,134 --> 03:22:33,130
spiraling arc of flammable honey that goes
everywhere. You do hit one of the ninjas

2729
03:22:33,130 --> 03:22:35,940
with a decent amount of honey. 
Gets a little disoriented.

2730
03:22:35,940 --> 03:22:44,003
Backs into one of the torch "sconches." 
Sconces. Lights on fire.

2731
03:22:44,003 --> 03:22:45,630
TALIESIN: We've got to roll, kids.

2732
03:22:45,630 --> 03:22:58,540
MARISHA: (yelping) He backs up, trips, blinded by
the fire, falls onto the ground. The fire starts

2733
03:22:58,540 --> 03:23:09,466
following the spilled honey, and then suddenly,
everyone: time slows down. Tova sees what happens.

2734
03:23:09,466 --> 03:23:20,329
She turns to everyone and goes, "Run!" and takes
off through the door.

2735
03:23:20,329 --> 03:23:22,923
TALIESIN: I teleport towards the cart.

2736
03:23:22,923 --> 03:23:26,942
BRIAN: I'm on the cart with the reins in my hands,
ready to go. I'm out there.

2737
03:23:26,942 --> 03:23:35,686
MARISHA: Waffle is gone. You see the fire 
getting closer and closer.

2738
03:23:35,686 --> 03:23:41,575
SAM: I'm going to head for the door, 
and on my way, I'm going to grab Tova by the hair

2739
03:23:41,575 --> 03:23:43,112
and pull her back in.

2740
03:23:43,112 --> 03:23:45,353
MARISHA: Oh shit!

2741
03:23:45,353 --> 03:23:48,478
LIAM: Are there still Bearracudas?

2742
03:23:48,478 --> 03:23:57,427
MARISHA: There are. One is now released free. 
One is on fire. The other is distracted

2743
03:23:57,427 --> 03:24:01,342
by your scratching, and there was one 
that Tova was squaring off.

2744
03:24:01,342 --> 03:24:03,161
LIAM: But she just got pulled through the door?

2745
03:24:03,161 --> 03:24:04,913
MARISHA: She got pulled through the door.

2746
03:24:04,913 --> 03:24:11,662
LIAM: I say: I hear my father's voice in the
morning. And I dive at the remaining Bearracuda

2747
03:24:11,662 --> 03:24:15,935
and plow them down 
into the flammable honey on the floor.

2748
03:24:15,935 --> 03:24:24,454
MARISHA: Okay, roll for bear attack. Also roll for
your muscle strength, so you get advantage.

2749
03:24:24,454 --> 03:24:25,708
LIAM: Yeah.

2750
03:24:25,708 --> 03:24:29,207
SAM: Fail, fail.

2751
03:24:29,207 --> 03:24:39,391
MARISHA: Oh no! You knock over the last remaining
free Bearracuda. He falls right into the flaming

2752
03:24:39,391 --> 03:24:45,470
honey, immediately bursts into flames-- way more
than probably would actually happen.

2753
03:24:45,470 --> 03:24:49,242
You scootch back. Roll to avoid the flame.

2754
03:24:49,242 --> 03:24:51,764
LIAM: Fail.

2755
03:24:51,764 --> 03:25:03,864
MARISHA: You do take a point into criminal for
what you just did. As you back up, Peddy you see

2756
03:25:03,864 --> 03:25:09,850
trying to bolt for the door, grabs Tova, throws
her right back into you. You guys boing.

2757
03:25:09,850 --> 03:25:13,448
So now it's you and Tova. You're out.

2758
03:25:13,448 --> 03:25:15,073
MATT: I have a question.

2759
03:25:15,073 --> 03:25:15,968
MARISHA: Yeah?

2760
03:25:15,968 --> 03:25:20,292
MATT: The trails of honey, are they heading
towards the large--

2761
03:25:20,292 --> 03:25:29,161
MARISHA: A hundred percent. You all have a good
solid four to five more seconds of slo-mo time.

2762
03:25:29,161 --> 03:25:36,510
(whoosh) Peddy's out!

2763
03:25:36,510 --> 03:25:40,759
Tova's like, "What the fuck?"

2764
03:25:40,816 --> 03:25:47,176
MATT: As Tova comes back and slams into Cookie, I
spin around, now that I see this is my fault,

2765
03:25:47,176 --> 03:25:51,297
and I push the back of Cookie to shove 
both of them back through the front doorway.

2766
03:25:51,297 --> 03:25:54,646
I'm going to try to use whatever bear strength 
I have to shove them forward.

2767
03:25:54,646 --> 03:25:56,460
MARISHA: Okay, roll for bear.

2768
03:25:56,460 --> 03:26:00,082
MATT: Success.

2769
03:26:00,082 --> 03:26:18,737
MARISHA: You guys trip. Trinket, as you push, 
you turn, and you see (flame noises).

2770
03:26:18,737 --> 03:26:23,469
And in slow motion, (explosions). 
You make one more bounding leap

2771
03:26:23,529 --> 03:26:27,275
as the explosion blows you out of the cellar door.

2772
03:26:27,275 --> 03:26:32,641
MATT: I close my eyes and in the back of my head,
go: I hope you're within about a hundred feet

2773
03:26:32,641 --> 03:26:36,889
of me, wherever you are, Vex.

2774
03:26:36,889 --> 03:26:48,412
MARISHA: You are jettisoned with the cellar door.
An exploding round of fire

2775
03:26:48,412 --> 03:26:55,057
comes barreling down the hall, burning
all of the oxygen-- that's how fire works--

2776
03:26:55,057 --> 03:27:02,527
in the room as it blasts out of the door. 
Everyone is safe, but there is no Trinket.

2777
03:27:02,527 --> 03:27:09,526
Flames die down. You look in the hallway,

2778
03:27:09,526 --> 03:27:16,356
and there, a little singed, flaming fur, 
with some bald spots, is Trinket.

2779
03:27:16,356 --> 03:27:18,598
SAM: Dead?

2780
03:27:18,598 --> 03:27:19,983
MARISHA: Still alive.

2781
03:27:19,983 --> 03:27:23,738
BRIAN: Get out here! Can I yell "get out here" 
at him?

2782
03:27:23,738 --> 03:27:26,437
MATT: Am I conscious?

2783
03:27:26,437 --> 03:27:27,910
MARISHA: You're unconscious.

2784
03:27:27,910 --> 03:27:29,700
BRIAN: Wake up and then get out here!

2785
03:27:29,700 --> 03:27:34,983
MATT: Which means she's not within a hundred feet
of me, for the love of god.

2786
03:27:34,983 --> 03:27:39,108
SAM: I'm going to go get Trinket and drag. 
No bear left behind!

2787
03:27:39,108 --> 03:27:41,038
MATT: Are the ninjas still around?

2788
03:27:41,038 --> 03:27:43,223
MARISHA: The ninjas all seem to be dead.

2789
03:27:43,223 --> 03:27:55,532
SAM: I'm going to drag him out, lay him down. No
harm will come today. Like in the Revenant,

2790
03:27:55,532 --> 03:28:06,960
I will aggressively mouth-to-mouth. 
Snout-to-snout resuscitation.

2791
03:28:06,960 --> 03:28:09,264
MARISHA: Roll for...

2792
03:28:09,264 --> 03:28:11,357
BRIAN: BPR?

2793
03:28:11,357 --> 03:28:14,522
MARISHA: Yeah. Roll for BPR.

2794
03:28:14,522 --> 03:28:16,410
LIAM: Like Ed Harris in the Abyss.

2795
03:28:16,410 --> 03:28:18,988
MARISHA: Roll for bear. Yeah, you got it. 
You're good.

2796
03:28:18,988 --> 03:28:24,406
SAM: (heavy breathing)

2797
03:28:24,406 --> 03:28:28,494
MARISHA: It's a really odd-looking sight. 
No one's sure what exactly is happening.

2798
03:28:28,494 --> 03:28:30,521
BRIAN: I cover the horse's eyes.

2799
03:28:30,521 --> 03:28:34,114
MARISHA: Trinket, you do wake up.

2800
03:28:34,114 --> 03:28:39,379
SAM: Trinket, if you'd died, I would be so upset.

2801
03:28:39,379 --> 03:28:47,618
MATT: Confused bear. What's going on?

2802
03:28:47,618 --> 03:28:54,245
MARISHA: About this time, Liam Las Vegas, 
you see all the guards running up the alley,

2803
03:28:54,245 --> 03:29:01,282
coming in this direction. The Sun Kissed Tavern 
is up in flames right now.

2804
03:29:01,282 --> 03:29:04,823
BRIAN: I fucking gently and humanely encourage
the--

2805
03:29:04,823 --> 03:29:13,042
MARISHA: You see another bald panda bear 
stumble out. "Oh shit."

2806
03:29:13,042 --> 03:29:18,766
It's Grog. Wakes up from everything. 
What are you guys doing?

2807
03:29:18,766 --> 03:29:20,687
TALIESIN: We're taking off with the honey.

2808
03:29:20,687 --> 03:29:25,250
LIAM: We've got to take the honey and run. 
Come on!

2809
03:29:25,250 --> 03:29:30,131
MATT: As a thank you to Peddy as I get up, 
I grab Peddy by the shoulders

2810
03:29:30,131 --> 03:29:32,220
and push Peddy up onto the cart 
with everybody else.

2811
03:29:32,220 --> 03:29:35,450
MARISHA: Tova runs over. She jumps into the back
of the cart. "Come on!"

2812
03:29:35,450 --> 03:29:38,774
LIAM: Hoppity-hop! Come on!

2813
03:29:38,774 --> 03:29:42,089
MARISHA: Trinket, you're the only one. 
Are you on?

2814
03:29:42,089 --> 03:29:52,256
MATT: No. I look up and say: My family's here.
A life of crime's not for me. You go on ahead.

2815
03:29:52,256 --> 03:29:53,932
You've earned it.

2816
03:29:53,932 --> 03:29:55,968
SAM: We'll never forget you.

2817
03:29:55,968 --> 03:29:58,761
TALIESIN: I grab a little jar of honey. 
Toss it down.

2818
03:29:58,761 --> 03:30:02,026
If anyone asks, we have no idea 
where it came from.

2819
03:30:02,026 --> 03:30:07,124
BRIAN: I yell down: Tell her to fucking remember
Hunter's Mark!

2820
03:30:07,124 --> 03:30:09,788
(laughter)

2821
03:30:09,788 --> 03:30:12,586
MATT: I do, constantly.

2822
03:30:12,586 --> 03:30:21,251
MARISHA: With a crack of the whips, 
you all speed off down into an empty alleyway.

2823
03:30:21,251 --> 03:30:24,849
LIAM: Could've been beautiful, kid. Good luck!

2824
03:30:24,849 --> 03:30:32,795
MARISHA: Tova yells, "Trinket! I'll remember this.
You are a great High Bear."

2825
03:30:32,795 --> 03:30:36,276
MATT: (moans)

2826
03:30:36,276 --> 03:30:43,970
MARISHA: (moans) The horse and buggy pulls off, 
a few rogue cabbages and vegetables

2827
03:30:43,970 --> 03:30:45,760
falling off the end.

2828
03:30:45,760 --> 03:30:53,658
SAM: I turn to the other dudes and say: Listen,
all this trouble for some honey. I know a place

2829
03:30:53,658 --> 03:31:00,728
where bamboo literally grows in forests. 
We can go there and eat as much of it as we want.

2830
03:31:00,728 --> 03:31:04,487
We don't have to break in anywhere. 
There's no surveillance cameras.

2831
03:31:04,487 --> 03:31:09,846
It just grows! Come with me. It'll be fun.
We can turn over a new leaf.

2832
03:31:09,846 --> 03:31:13,688
BRIAN: But on the other side of that leaf, 
there isn't going to be honey,

2833
03:31:13,688 --> 03:31:15,412
and for us, it's about the honey.

2834
03:31:15,412 --> 03:31:19,314
LIAM: Show me the honey.

2835
03:31:19,314 --> 03:31:22,784
BRIAN: Show me the honey, honey.

2836
03:31:22,784 --> 03:31:25,320
SAM: Tova, I'm sorry I tried to kill you.

2837
03:31:25,320 --> 03:31:33,294
MARISHA: "It's all right. It happens a lot. Yeah.
Y'all are all right. I'll talk to the High Bear

2838
03:31:33,294 --> 03:31:39,398
"committee and make sure you guys don't have 
any heat on your tails after this."

2839
03:31:39,398 --> 03:31:43,180
LIAM: You're sure you don't want to come with us?
See the world, sample honey?

2840
03:31:43,180 --> 03:31:49,449
MARISHA: "I've seen enough of the world. 
I think I'm ready for a little honey vacation."

2841
03:31:49,449 --> 03:31:52,119
LIAM: What the fuck does that mean?

2842
03:31:52,119 --> 03:31:55,756
SAM: I honestly don't know.

2843
03:31:55,756 --> 03:31:58,873
BRIAN: I think she's talking about rehab. 
I think she means rehab.

2844
03:31:58,873 --> 03:32:07,013
MARISHA: As you all ride off into the sunset, away
from Westruun, Trinket, you're back in the flaming

2845
03:32:07,013 --> 03:32:14,281
Sun Kissed Tavern. A bunch of guards run in, Vex
and Pike among them. Vex immediately sees you.

2846
03:32:14,281 --> 03:32:25,983
"Oh, my darling bear. Oh no! What happened?" 
She turns and looks at Grog. "Grog."

2847
03:32:25,983 --> 03:32:29,144
MATT: I fall on the ground and go belly-up and go,
(piteous moaning).

2848
03:32:29,144 --> 03:32:37,786
MARISHA: "Oh, buddy. Here, I got you those treats.
Did you save the day? Did you?

2849
03:32:37,786 --> 03:32:41,606
"Are you a good bear? Oh. Grog!"

2850
03:32:41,606 --> 03:32:44,550
And that is where we will end tonight's game.

2851
03:32:44,550 --> 03:32:55,171
(cheering)

2852
03:32:55,171 --> 03:32:56,553
BRIAN: All right!

2853
03:32:56,553 --> 03:32:58,698
MARISHA: That was terrifying! Oh my god.

2854
03:32:58,698 --> 03:33:04,890
LIAM: I wanted to break canon and take Trinket
with us across the nation! Goddamn it!

2855
03:33:04,890 --> 03:33:06,723
MATT: Trinket wouldn't leave.

2856
03:33:06,723 --> 03:33:08,830
BRIAN: We would've gotten 
some strongly worded emails.

2857
03:33:08,830 --> 03:33:13,157
TALIESIN: I wonder if it was Sam Elliot 
at the bar telling that story.

2858
03:33:13,157 --> 03:33:15,113
"Well, Trinket had quite a time."

2859
03:33:15,113 --> 03:33:17,566
BRIAN: Sometimes, there's a bear.

2860
03:33:17,566 --> 03:33:19,983
MARISHA: Good work, bears.

2861
03:33:19,983 --> 03:33:23,430
MATT: Thank you so much for running that. 
Thank you, Marisha.

2862
03:33:23,430 --> 03:33:26,636
TALIESIN: Holy fucking shit.

2863
03:33:26,636 --> 03:33:29,533
MARISHA: I don't think we fucked up canon too
much. That's all right, right?

2864
03:33:29,533 --> 03:33:32,436
LIAM: Fucked up canon? Tova's alive!

2865
03:33:32,436 --> 03:33:33,574
MARISHA: Tova's alive.

2866
03:33:33,574 --> 03:33:34,696
LIAM: Tova's alive!

2867
03:33:34,696 --> 03:33:39,462
MARISHA: I hope Noelle is okay with me doing this.
I meant to text her and email her about it, and I

2868
03:33:39,462 --> 03:33:42,303
kept forgetting, so sorry, Tova.

2869
03:33:42,303 --> 03:33:45,309
BRIAN: I got a text that she has begun litigation
against us already.

2870
03:33:45,309 --> 03:33:47,550
LIAM: Tova's alive!

2871
03:33:47,550 --> 03:33:50,497
BRIAN: Thank you, Grant, for making an amazing
game, too.

2872
03:33:50,497 --> 03:33:55,759
MARISHA: Yeah, for anyone who wants to play this.
If you watched this and were like, "holy shit, now

2873
03:33:55,759 --> 03:34:00,213
"I want to play Honey Heist," it's free to
download. You can download it off his website,

2874
03:34:00,213 --> 03:34:02,620
which I believe is granthowitt.com.

2875
03:34:02,620 --> 03:34:05,141
LIAM: Single sheet, in very large text.

2876
03:34:05,141 --> 03:34:12,305
MARISHA: Yeah, it is a two-page rulebook. One
page for everyone, and one page for the DM. And

2877
03:34:12,305 --> 03:34:19,574
there is a super-secret spells list, if you are a
Patreon backer.

2878
03:34:19,574 --> 03:34:28,443
SAM: One of the spells that I accidentally got
would've turned one of us into secretly two bears

2879
03:34:28,443 --> 03:34:33,821
hiding in a bear costume, and we popped out 
and became two bears.

2880
03:34:33,821 --> 03:34:41,530
MARISHA: You guys were actually supposed to find 
a trenchcoat at some point and get that.

2881
03:34:41,530 --> 03:34:43,313
TALIESIN: And get two bears in a trenchcoat?

2882
03:34:43,313 --> 03:34:44,937
MARISHA: Yeah, it's two bears in a trenchcoat.

2883
03:34:44,937 --> 03:34:50,070
MATT: If you're looking for extra content 
like that, he offers that on his Patreon.

2884
03:34:50,070 --> 03:34:56,235
MARISHA: On his Patreon, yeah. It should be
spammed in the chat right now:

2885
03:34:56,304 --> 03:35:03,626
patreon.com/gshowitt, I believe. 
But yeah, there's a whole other optional--

2886
03:35:03,626 --> 03:35:11,232
you can roll to have cantrips 
and things like that as an added dimension.

2887
03:35:11,232 --> 03:35:14,963
SAM: Where do they get the battle board from
tonight's game?

2888
03:35:14,963 --> 03:35:18,181
MARISHA: That you can get on Amazon Prime!

2889
03:35:18,181 --> 03:35:20,246
SAM: With that song?

2890
03:35:20,246 --> 03:35:25,000
MATT: You can find that theme on iTunes 
for download.

2891
03:35:25,000 --> 03:35:28,464
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)

2892
03:35:28,464 --> 03:35:32,408
(electronic song in Korean)

2893
03:35:32,408 --> 03:35:35,921
MARISHA: I came across this one and was like,
"Shit, it says it plays a song?

2894
03:35:35,921 --> 03:35:40,703
"I don't want anything that plays music-- 
no, I want something that plays music." Yeah.

2895
03:35:40,703 --> 03:35:42,473
BRIAN: Pineapple pen.

2896
03:35:42,473 --> 03:35:46,767
(laughter)

2897
03:35:46,767 --> 03:35:56,956
MARISHA: I tried to come up with a million codes
and gave up, so that's how that letter came out.

2898
03:35:56,956 --> 03:36:00,593
SAM: We'll talk about it on Talks Machina.

2899
03:36:00,593 --> 03:36:04,615
BRIAN: Talks on Tuesday with Marisha 
and whoever else is not working.

2900
03:36:04,615 --> 03:36:09,092
MARISHA: And I guess we'll see all of you guys 
at PAX.

2901
03:36:09,092 --> 03:36:16,800
SAM: Special thanks to our sponsor tonight: Marvel
Puzzle Quest. Go to bit.ly/MarvelCrit, capital M,

2902
03:36:16,800 --> 03:36:23,992
capital C. Make sure that they know that 
Critical Role sent you. And don't forget, also,

2903
03:36:23,992 --> 03:36:30,095
that you can battle with some of your favorite 
X-Men, like Rogue or Gambit. That's all I've got.

2904
03:36:30,095 --> 03:36:36,234
MARISHA: Thank you all so much. Next week 
is Sam's one-shot. We will see you all soon.

2905
03:36:36,234 --> 03:36:38,324
Is it Thursday yet?

2906
03:36:38,324 --> 03:36:42,826
BRIAN: It's still Thursday, technically.
I got one! No, I didn't. Goddamn it.

2907
03:36:42,826 --> 03:43:26,134
