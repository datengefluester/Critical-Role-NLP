1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,804
MATT: Hey, everyone. Sorry about that little issue
there. But thank you for your patience. I

2
00:00:03,883 --> 00:00:11,648
appreciate that. Going back over what had
transpired previously. So the party was hired to

3
00:00:11,648 --> 00:00:17,791
go into Kraghammer seeking Lady Kima of Vord, who
is a renowned folk hero, a halfling paladin of

4
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:24,044
much renown, following Bahamut, the Platinum
Dragon of justice and good, who went on a vision

5
00:00:24,044 --> 00:00:29,016
quest, apparently seeing some sort of evil brewing
beneath Kraghammer, and went on her own to seek it

6
00:00:29,016 --> 00:00:34,488
and destroy it. Hasn't been seen for many
weeks-- months, even -- since. And so the party has

7
00:00:34,488 --> 00:00:39,559
then gone into Kraghammer to attempt to locate
her. After some conversing, some brawling, some

8
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:44,209
interesting circumstances, they found information
that she disappeared into the Mithril mines just

9
00:00:44,209 --> 00:00:49,399
underneath the lower circle of Kraghammer. They've
since battled a few creatures, apparently these

10
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:55,034
strange monstrosities are coming out of the mines
recently. And they've had dwarven miners being

11
00:00:55,034 --> 00:00:59,659
taken and disappearing. They charged into the
mines, found one of the series of tunnels that had

12
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:06,029
broken into the mines from some other source,
encountered a few umber hulks, were ambushed by

13
00:01:06,243 --> 00:01:10,356
some duergar, which are subterranean, dark, ashen
grey--

14
00:01:10,356 --> 00:01:11,308
TRAVIS: Dickholes.

15
00:01:11,308 --> 00:01:16,144
MATT: -- messed-up dwarves and an intellect
devourer, which proceeded to blast Grog, reduce

16
00:01:16,195 --> 00:01:19,040
his intelligence to zero, and leave him catatonic
and brain-dead.

17
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,003
TRAVIS: (laughs)

18
00:01:20,003 --> 00:01:23,340
MATT: And that's where we left off. But we'll pick
up that in a second. Let's go ahead and continue

19
00:01:23,393 --> 00:01:26,500
our introductions. We had Taliesin, now we have
Marisha--

20
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:32,514
MARISHA: Yes! Hello, I am Marisha Ray, and I am
Keyleth of the Air Ashari tribe.

21
00:01:32,514 --> 00:01:35,856
And I am the Circle of the Moon druid. Level nine.

22
00:01:36,014 --> 00:01:36,914
MATT: Mm-hm.

23
00:01:36,914 --> 00:01:37,926
TRAVIS: Wow.

24
00:01:37,926 --> 00:01:40,015
MATT: Orion?

25
00:01:40,015 --> 00:01:48,894
ORION: Hi! I am Orion Acaba. And I play Tiberius
Stormwind, the dragonborn sorcerer.

26
00:01:48,894 --> 00:01:51,304
Level nine. Super badass.

27
00:01:51,304 --> 00:01:53,166
TRAVIS: Scaly.

28
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:58,110
SAM: Oh hi, I am Sam Riegel. I play Scanlan
Shorthalt, the level nine bard gnome,

29
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,797
who is the handsomest and most charming of 
the group.

30
00:02:01,797 --> 00:02:04,786
(all laugh)

31
00:02:04,786 --> 00:02:06,020
TRAVIS: Scanlan Shorthalt.

32
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,072
SAM: Scanlan Shorthalt.

33
00:02:07,072 --> 00:02:08,401
MATT: Yeah. Esquire.

34
00:02:08,401 --> 00:02:10,286
LAURA: The third.

35
00:02:10,286 --> 00:02:11,692
MATT: Yes, the third.

36
00:02:11,692 --> 00:02:14,410
LAURA: Hi! Oh, my brother is extra, extra stealth
right now.

37
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,307
TRAVIS: Yeah.

38
00:02:15,307 --> 00:02:20,842
LAURA: But I play Vex'ahlia, who is a half-elf
ranger, and I have an amazing--

39
00:02:20,842 --> 00:02:21,676
SAM: Ranger!

40
00:02:21,676 --> 00:02:28,188
LAURA: -- companion bear named Trinket, who is
basically the coolest ever. And he's good at

41
00:02:28,188 --> 00:02:32,638
everything he does. I'm okay. But he's excellent.

42
00:02:32,638 --> 00:02:34,837
MATT: He's really, really good. Yeah.

43
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:41,167
TRAVIS: I'm Grog Strongjaw. I'm a goliath
barbarian, level nine.

44
00:02:41,167 --> 00:02:42,755
LAURA: Oh, I didn't say that. Level nine.

45
00:02:42,755 --> 00:02:45,913
TRAVIS: I have an intelligence of six normally,
but now it's negative two.

46
00:02:45,993 --> 00:02:46,812
LAURA: Oh!

47
00:02:46,812 --> 00:02:48,356
TRAVIS: And my brain is made of applesauce.

48
00:02:48,356 --> 00:02:51,251
LAURA: Poor Grog!

49
00:02:51,251 --> 00:02:53,816
MATT: Liam, who is not here yet, but will be here
shortly but--

50
00:02:53,816 --> 00:02:54,724
TRAVIS: He's peeing.

51
00:02:54,724 --> 00:02:55,603
MATT: He is peeing, and what's--

52
00:02:55,603 --> 00:02:56,352
ORION: Oh my god.

53
00:02:56,352 --> 00:02:57,199
TRAVIS: On a tree.

54
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:58,551
MATT: And when he returns we'll get to his
introduction as well.

55
00:02:58,551 --> 00:02:59,325
TRAVIS: Stealthily.

56
00:02:59,325 --> 00:03:01,245
MATT: And Ashley Johnson, who has missed the last
couple of games because she's been filming,

57
00:03:01,245 --> 00:03:03,064
when she returns will be playing Pike.

58
00:03:03,064 --> 00:03:04,261
LAURA: Hey!

59
00:03:04,261 --> 00:03:06,027
TALIESIN: Hey!

60
00:03:06,027 --> 00:03:07,065
MATT: Who is a cleric. Our gnome cleric.

61
00:03:07,065 --> 00:03:08,946
Liam's arrived! Huzzah!

62
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:10,506
LAURA: We're just introducing ourselves, that's
all.

63
00:03:10,506 --> 00:03:12,410
MATT: Exactly! It's okay, we've had technical
difficulties, so.

64
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:13,812
ORION: Oh, hey, he made the introductions, folks.

65
00:03:13,812 --> 00:03:15,064
LAURA: Oh, hi, Mark, welcome to the game.

66
00:03:15,064 --> 00:03:16,212
LIAM: Oh, hi.

67
00:03:16,212 --> 00:03:18,310
MATT: Before we start too, just a couple quick
announcements. A couple cool games that have come

68
00:03:18,376 --> 00:03:21,531
out recently that some of us have been involved
with. Today was the launch of Pillars of Eternity,

69
00:03:21,531 --> 00:03:25,567
a completely awesome kind of successor to Baldur's
Gate. Both me and Liam are part of that as well.

70
00:03:25,567 --> 00:03:27,940
Those who are playing through, I voice Aloth and
Adair.

71
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,873
Liam, if you remember any characters you voiced 
in it.

72
00:03:29,936 --> 00:03:31,580
LIAM: The guy.

73
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,477
MATT: The guy.

74
00:03:32,477 --> 00:03:33,114
LAURA: (laughs)

75
00:03:33,114 --> 00:03:34,331
MATT: He voices the guy.

76
00:03:34,331 --> 00:03:36,946
We're scattered throughout the game so
just-- If you can't get enough of us here, you'll

77
00:03:37,002 --> 00:03:40,302
be really hating our voices by playing through
that. And then also, Orion--

78
00:03:40,302 --> 00:03:44,638
ORION: Oh, yeah. On a more radder note, Final
Fantasy Type-0--

79
00:03:44,638 --> 00:03:48,639
you should play-- is out also. I play Nine. 
In that.

80
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:49,392
MATT: Yeah.

81
00:03:49,392 --> 00:03:51,242
ORION: And Matthew Mercer plays Trey in it as
well.

82
00:03:51,242 --> 00:03:52,168
MATT: Yeah.

83
00:03:52,168 --> 00:03:53,763
LIAM: I thought seven ate nine.

84
00:03:53,763 --> 00:03:54,693
LAURA: We're all pimping our shizz.

85
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:56,815
ORION: Seven does maybe eat nine. Who knows?

86
00:03:56,815 --> 00:03:57,646
MATT: Oh.

87
00:03:57,646 --> 00:03:58,766
LIAM: I'm a dad.

88
00:03:58,766 --> 00:04:00,452
MARISHA: (laughs) I'm a dad.

89
00:04:00,452 --> 00:04:02,755
ORION: Who knows, but it's definitely a different
take on any Final Fantasy you've ever played.

90
00:04:02,755 --> 00:04:05,929
And as a fan, I'm excited, so check it out, too.

91
00:04:05,929 --> 00:04:08,497
MATT: Yeah, it's legit awesome. So a lot of cool,
exciting things.

92
00:04:08,497 --> 00:04:12,305
LIAM: Also, this one's in Tales from the
Borderlands being awesome.

93
00:04:12,305 --> 00:04:12,929
LAURA: Oh, yeah.

94
00:04:12,929 --> 00:04:13,658
MATT: Yeah.

95
00:04:13,658 --> 00:04:14,677
LAURA: Episode two just came out.

96
00:04:14,677 --> 00:04:15,561
MATT: That's right! Congrats!

97
00:04:15,561 --> 00:04:16,276
LAURA: Yes.

98
00:04:16,276 --> 00:04:18,003
SAM: And I'll be playing at the Laugh Barn in St.
Louis.

99
00:04:18,003 --> 00:04:20,085
(all laugh)

100
00:04:20,085 --> 00:04:21,476
ORION: Every Tuesday.

101
00:04:21,476 --> 00:04:23,583
SAM: Three. Three nights. Three nights sold out.

102
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:24,558
ORION: Three nights.

103
00:04:24,558 --> 00:04:25,781
SAM: Opening for Carrot Top.

104
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:27,968
ORION: Check it out.

105
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:31,309
MATT: All right. Well, guys, let's go get down to
brass tacks.

106
00:04:31,464 --> 00:04:41,419
So, last we left off, in a subterranean
cavern with a deep underground river flowing

107
00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:47,634
through it. Pitch darkness. You managed to survive
a conflict with two umber hulks, thanks to

108
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:52,321
Polymorph and some good tactics. However, Grog
then charged headlong towards a light source--

109
00:04:52,321 --> 00:04:57,212
turned out to be a campfire across the way-- where
he walked into an ambush by a few duergar which

110
00:04:57,212 --> 00:05:00,115
began shooting him with crossbow bolts. And an
intellect devourer

111
00:05:00,115 --> 00:05:02,133
made him brain-dead. You guys--

112
00:05:02,133 --> 00:05:03,711
LAURA: He's got nobody to blame but himself.

113
00:05:03,711 --> 00:05:07,006
MATT: Kind of, that's okay. Grog owns it-- as you
can see by his glasses. So.

114
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:09,609
(all laugh)

115
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:10,609
MARISHA: I love those.

116
00:05:10,609 --> 00:05:13,885
MATT: So. We're beginning now as Grog has
collapsed, face down on the ground, drooling.

117
00:05:13,885 --> 00:05:15,149
LIAM: The future's so bright.

118
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:18,754
MATT: The last of the duergar have been blown off
the cliff or destroyed. You all rush in, and find

119
00:05:18,754 --> 00:05:23,392
Grog not moving, not responding, not anything.

120
00:05:23,392 --> 00:05:25,038
TRAVIS: Somebody pretty give me CPR.

121
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:26,034
LAURA: Don't talk.

122
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,058
TRAVIS: Okay.

123
00:05:27,058 --> 00:05:28,862
SAM: Grog! Grog, can you hear us?

124
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:29,610
LAURA: I rush down--

125
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:30,434
SAM: Can you feel us near you?

126
00:05:30,434 --> 00:05:31,937
LAURA: -- and slap him on the face a few times.

127
00:05:31,937 --> 00:05:32,585
MATT: You slap him.

128
00:05:32,585 --> 00:05:33,224
SAM: Nothing.

129
00:05:33,224 --> 00:05:34,134
MATT: You slap him.

130
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:34,950
SAM: Nothing.

131
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:35,832
MATT: You slap him. No response.

132
00:05:35,832 --> 00:05:37,633
SAM: Someone, quick! Draw a dick on his face!

133
00:05:37,633 --> 00:05:40,466
MARISHA: I also bend down and slap him a few
times.

134
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:41,897
(all laugh)

135
00:05:41,897 --> 00:05:48,021
MARISHA: And then I say, I knew it wouldn't work.
I just-- Dammit, Grog!

136
00:05:48,021 --> 00:05:51,721
TALIESIN: I'm going to actually try a crude
medical examination to see if I can--

137
00:05:51,721 --> 00:05:53,108
SAM: Ooh, investigation check?

138
00:05:53,108 --> 00:05:54,474
TRAVIS: So here's your numbers.

139
00:05:54,474 --> 00:05:55,302
MATT: Okay.

140
00:05:55,302 --> 00:05:59,413
TALIESIN: And yes! This is nice. 19.

141
00:05:59,413 --> 00:06:00,502
MATT: A 19 on the medicine?

142
00:06:00,502 --> 00:06:01,774
TALIESIN: On the medicine, yeah.

143
00:06:01,774 --> 00:06:02,493
MATT: Okay.

144
00:06:02,493 --> 00:06:03,459
TRAVIS: You leave my prostate alone.

145
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:04,800
(all laugh)

146
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,304
TALIESIN: After I palpate the region.

147
00:06:06,304 --> 00:06:09,104
MATT: A thorough goliath cavity search later--

148
00:06:09,104 --> 00:06:11,882
MARISHA: Ohh.

149
00:06:11,882 --> 00:06:13,442
MATT: You find some stray gold pieces.

150
00:06:13,493 --> 00:06:15,487
LIAM: There's where that pony went!

151
00:06:15,487 --> 00:06:18,752
TALIESIN: That's a very deep belly button you have
there, my god!

152
00:06:18,752 --> 00:06:21,183
MATT: The goliath physicality's a little
difficult.

153
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,549
LIAM: Found the troll dick!

154
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:25,803
LAURA: Ohh.

155
00:06:25,856 --> 00:06:30,164
MATT: Looking over him, and there's very little
physical damage to him. He shrugs it off pretty

156
00:06:30,164 --> 00:06:34,759
easily. There's no notable sign or anything other
than the fact that his eyes aren't reacting to

157
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:36,795
anything. It looks like he is catatonic.

158
00:06:36,795 --> 00:06:38,207
TALIESIN: No bleeding from the ear? No bleeding
from the nose?

159
00:06:38,207 --> 00:06:39,306
MATT: Nope.

160
00:06:39,306 --> 00:06:42,706
TALIESIN: I'm going to go take a look at the
remnants of the brain creature.

161
00:06:42,706 --> 00:06:47,158
MATT: All right. What bits of the currently
thawing chunks of it-- blasted apart by Tiberius'

162
00:06:47,158 --> 00:06:52,938
Glacial Blast-- It appears to be tougher than
normal, but very similar to gray matter in appearance

163
00:06:52,987 --> 00:06:59,820
and texture. Other than these strange, kind of
reddish-brown bestial legs that were once attached

164
00:06:59,934 --> 00:07:03,226
to its mid-section are now blown apart and cast to
the ground.

165
00:07:03,226 --> 00:07:06,563
The whole texture seems very slimy and rubbery.

166
00:07:06,563 --> 00:07:07,528
LAURA: Ew.

167
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:11,597
MATT: And it's much larger than any natural brain
should be. It's probably-- When it was all in one

168
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:15,250
piece, it would have been roughly about the size
of a small dog.

169
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:20,926
LAURA: Do any of us know anything about magic that
could heal him? Like any spells.

170
00:07:20,926 --> 00:07:22,913
MATT: Do you?

171
00:07:22,913 --> 00:07:23,587
LAURA: I mean--

172
00:07:23,587 --> 00:07:24,549
MARISHA: I think I might--

173
00:07:24,549 --> 00:07:30,927
ORION: It's clear that when that brain thing hit
Grog with his zapper thing, that it rendered him

174
00:07:30,927 --> 00:07:36,684
unconscious. I would assume that it is a magical
creature, just based on the attack alone.

175
00:07:36,684 --> 00:07:37,789
LAURA: Thank you, Tiberius.

176
00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:38,844
MARISHA: Anything we should know?

177
00:07:38,844 --> 00:07:39,762
SAM: Excellent assessment, Tiberius.

178
00:07:39,762 --> 00:07:40,966
LAURA: Thank you.

179
00:07:40,966 --> 00:07:41,806
ORION: Quite right.

180
00:07:41,806 --> 00:07:44,017
TALIESIN: He got zapped and now he's unconscious.

181
00:07:44,017 --> 00:07:45,318
SAM: A shorter way of saying the same thing.

182
00:07:45,318 --> 00:07:47,330
LAURA: Maybe we should try-- Does anybody have any
healing? I know Pike isn't here, but--

183
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,855
MARISHA: I--

184
00:07:48,855 --> 00:07:49,813
ORION: You have something, don't you?

185
00:07:49,813 --> 00:07:55,346
MARISHA: I think I have a spell. That might be
able to help. I don't know it right now though.

186
00:07:55,346 --> 00:08:00,411
We'd have to take a break. I'd have to pull out my
books and relearn it. It takes some time.

187
00:08:00,411 --> 00:08:02,309
LIAM: How much time do you need?

188
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:03,517
MARISHA: Need to sleep on it.

189
00:08:03,517 --> 00:08:04,233
LAURA: How-- Can we--

190
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,122
TRAVIS: As they talk, Grog slowly flatulates.

191
00:08:06,122 --> 00:08:07,856
(all laugh)

192
00:08:07,856 --> 00:08:09,703
TRAVIS: (fart sound)

193
00:08:09,703 --> 00:08:10,723
SAM: It happens, it's natural.

194
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:11,650
MATT: It's terrible.

195
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,398
LAURA: Oh! It's another-- What is it? An ass
cloud? Is that what it was?

196
00:08:14,398 --> 00:08:15,762
MATT: Yeah.

197
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:16,665
SAM: Poo. Poo cloud.

198
00:08:16,665 --> 00:08:17,386
LAURA: Lovely.

199
00:08:17,386 --> 00:08:18,382
LIAM: Everybody make a constitution saving throw.

200
00:08:18,382 --> 00:08:19,325
LAURA: Yeah, a constitution saving--

201
00:08:19,325 --> 00:08:21,845
ORION: How many entrances-- How many ways or edges
where we are?

202
00:08:21,845 --> 00:08:23,714
Because it's like at the center, anyway--

203
00:08:23,714 --> 00:08:26,664
MATT: Yeah, you're currently basically on the
precipice of a large cavern that has multiple

204
00:08:26,664 --> 00:08:30,925
layers as the river kind of cascades off into
multiple waterfalls. As far as you can see-- which

205
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:35,264
isn't far good because there's no other light
source beyond you guys-- the cavern just continues

206
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:38,723
indefinitely for a good 60 feet and then just
vanishes into darkness.

207
00:08:38,723 --> 00:08:41,360
LAURA: Well, maybe we should sleep. Try to camp
for the time--

208
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,683
SAM: Well, we'll need to form a perimeter and
someone will have to stand guard--

209
00:08:44,683 --> 00:08:48,365
MATT: Well, currently you're holding a barely
alive duergar hostage.

210
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:50,247
LAURA: (gasps) Oh! Right! I forgot about that!

211
00:08:50,247 --> 00:08:51,354
SAM: Oh, we gotta interrogate.

212
00:08:51,354 --> 00:08:53,571
LAURA: We gotta interrogate him! Her.

213
00:08:53,571 --> 00:08:54,817
LAURA and SAM: It.

214
00:08:54,817 --> 00:08:55,619
MATT: It's a female.

215
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:56,394
LIAM: Female.

216
00:08:56,394 --> 00:08:57,551
LAURA: And I can speak its language.

217
00:08:57,551 --> 00:08:58,123
MATT: You do.

218
00:08:58,123 --> 00:08:58,965
LIAM: Hers.

219
00:08:58,965 --> 00:08:59,828
MATT: You speak Undercommon.

220
00:08:59,828 --> 00:09:00,666
LAURA: Hers.

221
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,592
MATT: First thing you note, too: it is female, and
it takes a moment to

222
00:09:02,592 --> 00:09:04,228
register that because she is also bald on top.

223
00:09:04,228 --> 00:09:05,598
LIAM: It. Terrible.

224
00:09:05,598 --> 00:09:06,587
LAURA: Sorry.

225
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:11,058
MATT: Nasty, pale, kind of sunken face. Eyes are
completely clouded over and white, no pupils.

226
00:09:11,058 --> 00:09:14,908
Teeth are kind of yellow and gnarled and sharp.

227
00:09:14,908 --> 00:09:19,109
SAM: How close to death's door is she?

228
00:09:19,109 --> 00:09:19,882
LIAM: What's this?

229
00:09:19,882 --> 00:09:20,792
LAURA: What?

230
00:09:20,792 --> 00:09:21,594
LIAM: Thank you, sir.

231
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:22,797
MARISHA: Oh my gosh.

232
00:09:22,797 --> 00:09:24,346
LAURA: Oh, thank you, wonderful people!

233
00:09:24,346 --> 00:09:26,079
CREW: There's more coming, this is the vegan
pizza.

234
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:26,962
ORION: Whoa!

235
00:09:26,962 --> 00:09:27,919
LAURA: What?

236
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:29,077
ORION: Where's it coming?

237
00:09:29,077 --> 00:09:30,301
LAURA: Thank you, chat room!

238
00:09:30,301 --> 00:09:32,364
TRAVIS: Thank you, chat room.

239
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:33,141
ORION: Chat room!

240
00:09:33,141 --> 00:09:34,322
SAM: Chat room? Chat room bought us a pizza?

241
00:09:34,322 --> 00:09:35,235
MARISHA: Thanks, guys!

242
00:09:35,235 --> 00:09:36,297
MATT: You guys are awesome! Thank you so much!

243
00:09:36,297 --> 00:09:37,326
LIAM: You knew I liked jalapenos.

244
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,539
LAURA: Vegan pizza? Are you kidding me?

245
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:39,735
MARISHA: And donuts!

246
00:09:39,735 --> 00:09:40,579
MATT: Oh yeah.

247
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:41,488
TALIESIN: Pizza made it.

248
00:09:41,488 --> 00:09:43,194
LAURA: Look at those chocolate cakes! Oh.

249
00:09:43,194 --> 00:09:45,550
ORION: (laughs) Oh.

250
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:48,848
SAM: All right, all right. This creature is very
injured.

251
00:09:48,848 --> 00:09:52,404
I think we need to heal her just enough--

252
00:09:52,404 --> 00:09:53,302
LAURA: Heal her?

253
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:54,210
SAM: Just enough.

254
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,252
LIAM: Not so fast, not so fast.

255
00:09:55,252 --> 00:09:56,794
LAURA: We'll heal her after she talks.

256
00:09:56,794 --> 00:09:57,712
LIAM: Is she unconscious?

257
00:09:57,712 --> 00:09:58,859
SAM: Why don't you make that bargain then--

258
00:09:58,859 --> 00:10:01,090
LIAM: I've got dagger to her throat and I'm hold--
She's bald?

259
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:02,107
MATT: Bald, yes.

260
00:10:02,107 --> 00:10:03,920
LIAM: All right, so I've got an arm around the top
of her forehead in--

261
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,039
MATT: (hisses)

262
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,325
LAURA: Don't kill her. I need her.

263
00:10:06,325 --> 00:10:07,406
LIAM: She's not unconscious, right?

264
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:08,080
MATT: No.

265
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,030
LAURA: I got up--

266
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,138
MATT: She's got a huge shoulder wound.

267
00:10:10,138 --> 00:10:12,756
LIAM: All right, I call my sister over. I'll hold
her, you talk.

268
00:10:12,756 --> 00:10:15,039
LAURA: What did you do to our friend?

269
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:21,566
MATT: "I didn't do anything. That was the brain's
work." (chuckles)

270
00:10:21,566 --> 00:10:23,949
LAURA: What did the brain work do to our friend?

271
00:10:23,949 --> 00:10:25,025
MARISHA: Brain twerk?

272
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:30,111
MATT: "Took care of your friend. He's gone now.
He's all dead inside. Kaputski."

273
00:10:30,111 --> 00:10:35,577
LAURA: What are you here for?

274
00:10:35,577 --> 00:10:37,753
MATT: "Just creating a mess."

275
00:10:37,753 --> 00:10:40,211
LAURA: What should I fucking ask her? I say that
in our language, not--

276
00:10:40,211 --> 00:10:42,922
(all laugh)

277
00:10:42,922 --> 00:10:44,180
LAURA: What should I ask?

278
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,412
TALIESIN: How do we fix it?

279
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:48,246
LAURA: How do we-- (lowers voice) How do we fix
it?

280
00:10:48,246 --> 00:10:49,757
TALIESIN: There you go.

281
00:10:49,757 --> 00:10:52,666
MATT: "Bury your dead weight."

282
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,461
LIAM: I press the blade a little tighter.

283
00:10:54,461 --> 00:10:55,820
MATT: "Ugh! Gah!"

284
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,239
LIAM: Dig in. Maybe one hit point worth of--

285
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,590
LAURA: No, no! She's only got one hit point left.

286
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,404
LIAM: She's only got one?

287
00:10:59,404 --> 00:11:00,261
MATT: She's got one hit point.

288
00:11:00,261 --> 00:11:00,970
LIAM: All right.

289
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:01,779
LAURA: Don't do that!

290
00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:03,061
(all laugh)

291
00:11:03,061 --> 00:11:04,395
TALIESIN: Is she bleeding?

292
00:11:04,395 --> 00:11:05,447
MATT: Profusely. From the shoulder.

293
00:11:05,447 --> 00:11:08,063
TALIESIN: Oh! In that case, I'm going to cauterize
the wounds.

294
00:11:08,063 --> 00:11:10,294
There's more than one way to make 
someone talk!

295
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,064
LAURA: Ugh.

296
00:11:11,064 --> 00:11:13,135
TALIESIN: I'm going to shoot my gun off-- get it
nice and hot

297
00:11:13,189 --> 00:11:15,370
right at the tip and start cauterizing the wounds.

298
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:20,056
MATT: Okay so (gunshot). And the flash goes off.
The sound of blast echoes throughout the entirety

299
00:11:20,056 --> 00:11:23,060
of the cavern. You can hear (echoing gunshot)
cascade off.

300
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,637
MARISHA: A little warning next time!

301
00:11:24,637 --> 00:11:29,238
MATT: He takes the barrel, slams it into the
shoulder and the sizzling sound as she reaches

302
00:11:29,238 --> 00:11:32,928
back in pain. Make an intimidation check.

303
00:11:32,928 --> 00:11:34,159
TALIESIN: I'm intimidated.

304
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:37,718
LAURA: What should we ask her?

305
00:11:37,718 --> 00:11:39,224
TALIESIN: Aha ha! 21!

306
00:11:39,224 --> 00:11:45,505
MATT: 21? All right. She's now, like, breathing
heavy.

307
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:50,350
ORION: I'm using my Mage Hand to poke her in the
face.

308
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,866
MATT: She's trying to move her face out of the way
but she can't

309
00:11:52,866 --> 00:11:55,700
seem to avoid the mystical arcane finger pokes.

310
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,151
(all laugh)

311
00:11:58,151 --> 00:11:59,711
TALIESIN: Look, we haven't got all day. How do we
fix it--

312
00:11:59,711 --> 00:12:00,738
LAURA: Who do you work for?

313
00:12:00,738 --> 00:12:01,989
TALIESIN: And who do you work for?

314
00:12:01,989 --> 00:12:08,223
MATT: "You fell, surface-slime. You've already
fallen, and the Master's gathered the sheep.

315
00:12:08,223 --> 00:12:12,042
"You shall all be harvested for K'varn!"

316
00:12:12,042 --> 00:12:14,847
ORION: Ah, is he a farmer?

317
00:12:14,847 --> 00:12:16,271
SAM: You can't understand her. Only she can.

318
00:12:16,271 --> 00:12:17,145
LAURA: You can't understand!

319
00:12:17,145 --> 00:12:17,793
ORION: Oh.

320
00:12:17,793 --> 00:12:19,424
LAURA: Who is K'varn? Does anybody know?

321
00:12:19,424 --> 00:12:20,950
SAM: No, is that a thing? Is that a person?

322
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,261
LAURA: I don't know. I don't know. I've got--

323
00:12:22,261 --> 00:12:23,560
TALIESIN: Can I roll history on that or is
that--?

324
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,480
LAURA: Who is K'varn?

325
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,252
ORION: The Carvers!

326
00:12:25,252 --> 00:12:26,252
MATT: You can roll history, if you like.

327
00:12:26,252 --> 00:12:27,019
TALIESIN: All right.

328
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:27,930
LAURA: Argh, who is K'varn?

329
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:33,464
MATT: "K'varn is the one that rules these caverns.
The one who guides us to take the surface back!"

330
00:12:33,464 --> 00:12:34,672
LAURA: To take the surface back?

331
00:12:34,672 --> 00:12:36,517
TALIESIN: A 14 in history wouldn't do anything?

332
00:12:36,517 --> 00:12:37,400
MATT: No.

333
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:42,838
LAURA: Is K'varn the one making creepy zombie
monsters?

334
00:12:42,838 --> 00:12:47,189
MATT: "K'varn likes to tinker with the fleshlings,
yes."

335
00:12:47,254 --> 00:12:50,383
LAURA: Where is K'varn located? Point the
direction.

336
00:12:50,383 --> 00:12:54,243
MATT: Looks over her shoulder back towards the
darker part of the cavern where you guys haven't

337
00:12:54,243 --> 00:12:57,715
traversed. "Deep. Deep."

338
00:12:57,715 --> 00:12:59,280
SAM: What is K'varn?

339
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,725
LAURA: What. Is. K'varn?

340
00:13:01,725 --> 00:13:03,400
MATT: "You'll see."

341
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,625
LAURA: No, you'll tell me now.

342
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,710
TRAVIS: Good question.

343
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:07,984
LAURA: I slap her across the face.

344
00:13:07,984 --> 00:13:08,788
MATT: Argh!

345
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,471
LAURA: Lightly! Not enough to make her lose a hit
point.

346
00:13:10,471 --> 00:13:12,883
ORION: I poke her more!

347
00:13:12,883 --> 00:13:15,436
(all laugh)

348
00:13:15,436 --> 00:13:17,831
MARISHA: It's like a Three Stooges act.

349
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:19,921
MATT: "My life is already forfeit."

350
00:13:19,972 --> 00:13:20,939
MARISHA: Oh!

351
00:13:20,939 --> 00:13:27,929
MATT: "I'm just relishing your faces, for they
will be gnarled and twisted soon enough!"

352
00:13:27,929 --> 00:13:30,409
LAURA: Break her legs. Leave her here.

353
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:31,163
MATT: You break her--

354
00:13:31,163 --> 00:13:32,465
LAURA: Heal her. Maybe we should heal her--

355
00:13:32,465 --> 00:13:33,433
MATT: (laughs)

356
00:13:33,433 --> 00:13:35,826
LAURA: And let her lay there. Is that evil? That's
pretty evil.

357
00:13:35,826 --> 00:13:36,945
TRAVIS: What's your alignment? I mean--

358
00:13:36,945 --> 00:13:38,246
LAURA: My alignment. I'm good.

359
00:13:38,246 --> 00:13:39,936
TALIESIN: She did just help--

360
00:13:39,936 --> 00:13:41,845
MARISHA: Wait! Ask her if she's seen Nostoc. Or if
they've seen--

361
00:13:41,845 --> 00:13:42,818
LAURA: Oh yes!

362
00:13:42,818 --> 00:13:46,767
MARISHA: Or, yeah, if they've seen our paladin
friend. Our little--

363
00:13:46,767 --> 00:13:47,678
TALIESIN: Lady Kima.

364
00:13:47,678 --> 00:13:50,728
MARISHA: Lady Kima!

365
00:13:50,728 --> 00:13:56,639
LAURA: Before we end your life, tell us, have you
seen a small halfling?

366
00:13:56,691 --> 00:14:02,347
MATT: You see a moment of recognition in the
female duergar's face, and it's--

367
00:14:02,418 --> 00:14:10,837
"There was a halfling, aye. She was foolish enough
to come down here alone. She's dead now."

368
00:14:10,837 --> 00:14:12,299
SAM: (gasps)

369
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:16,352
MATT: "We've taken her life and it was
delicious."

370
00:14:16,352 --> 00:14:22,233
LIAM: I drag her to her feet. Walk her over to the
edge of the cliff where the water is, and hold

371
00:14:22,233 --> 00:14:29,926
her. Knife still at her neck. Tell this one: Now's
her last chance to give us anything useful

372
00:14:29,926 --> 00:14:33,420
to lead to her boss, I guess.

373
00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:39,222
LAURA: All right. It's your last chance. Give us
something useful? And we'll end this painlessly.

374
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:43,061
Don't, and we'll make you suffer.

375
00:14:43,061 --> 00:14:44,253
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

376
00:14:44,253 --> 00:14:47,414
LAURA: All right. Ooh, my new dice! Ooh! C'mon,
baby!

377
00:14:47,414 --> 00:14:51,573
LIAM: I'm going to assist her by taking my other
dagger and letting it drip poison down the blade.

378
00:14:51,573 --> 00:14:52,613
MATT: (laughs)

379
00:14:52,613 --> 00:14:53,523
LIAM: Advantage? Advantage?

380
00:14:53,523 --> 00:14:55,110
LAURA: Intimidation of 14?

381
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,149
LIAM: Assist?

382
00:14:56,149 --> 00:14:57,811
MATT: Go ahead and roll dice.

383
00:14:57,811 --> 00:14:58,542
LIAM: Me?

384
00:14:58,542 --> 00:14:59,370
MATT: You, yes.

385
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,385
LAURA: (squeaky voice) To assist me?

386
00:15:00,385 --> 00:15:01,021
LIAM: 19.

387
00:15:01,021 --> 00:15:02,186
MATT: 19. Okay, go ahead and roll again.

388
00:15:02,186 --> 00:15:02,935
LAURA: Oh.

389
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:04,033
LIAM: Drip drip drip drip drip.

390
00:15:04,033 --> 00:15:06,211
MATT: I'm giving you the advantage on the roll
because he has a blade to her now.

391
00:15:06,211 --> 00:15:08,274
LAURA: Oh, okay. Okay, still 14.

392
00:15:08,346 --> 00:15:09,461
MATT: Still 14.

393
00:15:09,461 --> 00:15:11,619
LAURA: I should've rolled my other one. To see.
Just to see.

394
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:18,689
MATT: She laughs and says: "Your friend's dead!
All is lost! You came for nothing!"

395
00:15:18,689 --> 00:15:21,359
SAM: Can I tell if she's lying? Is it--

396
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:22,533
MATT: Make an insight check.

397
00:15:22,761 --> 00:15:25,856
SAM: Insight check? Oop. No. (laughs)

398
00:15:25,856 --> 00:15:27,525
LAURA: Okay, can I see if she's lying?

399
00:15:27,525 --> 00:15:28,407
MATT: You can also make an insight check as well.

400
00:15:28,407 --> 00:15:30,513
LAURA: All right, cool.

401
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,039
LIAM: I can't understand what the-- What the
hell's she saying?

402
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:34,319
LAURA: Okay, that's way better! 24!

403
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:37,046
MATT: 24. She is definitively lying through her
teeth.

404
00:15:37,046 --> 00:15:37,719
LAURA: (gasps)

405
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:38,705
MATT: Just to hurt you.

406
00:15:38,705 --> 00:15:40,702
LAURA: Yes! We know you're lying!

407
00:15:40,702 --> 00:15:43,437
(all laugh)

408
00:15:43,437 --> 00:15:44,333
MATT: "What?"

409
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:50,406
LAURA: Yes! I don't know what else to ask her,
guys. I don't know what else to ask her.

410
00:15:50,406 --> 00:15:52,756
TRAVIS: What are goblins afraid of?

411
00:15:52,756 --> 00:16:00,532
MATT: She looks at you for a second, goes, "Regardless, we
have her. She's down below. And, soon enough,

412
00:16:00,597 --> 00:16:07,226
"you'll see. You'll see what shall become of this
halfling."

413
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:14,967
LAURA: We'll rescue her! And we're going to kill
your god!

414
00:16:14,967 --> 00:16:17,577
(all laugh)

415
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:20,597
LIAM: I did it, I did it.

416
00:16:20,597 --> 00:16:22,968
MATT: An ichor spray comes across.

417
00:16:22,968 --> 00:16:23,775
SAM: Ugh!

418
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:24,912
LAURA: That was the worst thing.

419
00:16:24,912 --> 00:16:27,531
TALIESIN: The most awkward throat-slitting I've
ever heard of.

420
00:16:27,531 --> 00:16:28,540
SAM: That was very fast.

421
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,847
MARISHA: We're going to kill your god. Wait.

422
00:16:30,847 --> 00:16:31,899
TALIESIN: Wait.

423
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:33,039
MARISHA: Fuck it, just go with it!

424
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:34,280
(all laugh)

425
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,255
MARISHA: Commit!

426
00:16:35,255 --> 00:16:37,916
MATT: As the body goes limp in your hands, you
kinda let it tumble over the waterfall.

427
00:16:37,999 --> 00:16:38,897
LIAM: Yeah.

428
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:41,396
LAURA: Good times. Good times, guys.

429
00:16:41,396 --> 00:16:47,559
MATT: Um, now you guys are standing over Grog in
this kind of makeshift--

430
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:49,084
LIAM: It's a little sticky, slimy?

431
00:16:49,084 --> 00:16:52,006
MATT: -- camp site. The embers of the fire kinda
going low.

432
00:16:52,006 --> 00:16:53,116
LIAM: I'm starved.

433
00:16:53,116 --> 00:16:55,334
TALIESIN: Well, she's researching--

434
00:16:55,334 --> 00:16:56,093
LAURA: Oh!

435
00:16:56,093 --> 00:16:56,709
MARISHA: Yes.

436
00:16:56,709 --> 00:16:58,006
LAURA: Should we keep-- I'm going to keep watch.

437
00:16:58,006 --> 00:16:58,725
LIAM: Absolutely.

438
00:16:58,725 --> 00:16:59,317
LAURA: With Trinket.

439
00:16:59,317 --> 00:16:59,944
SAM: We need to--

440
00:16:59,944 --> 00:17:01,418
MARISHA: Do we have any idea what time it is?

441
00:17:01,418 --> 00:17:05,343
MATT: At this point? It's at some point in the
evening.

442
00:17:05,343 --> 00:17:07,224
MARISHA: All right.

443
00:17:07,224 --> 00:17:11,274
SAM: Let's rest. Let's set up a perimeter and take
turns standing guard.

444
00:17:11,479 --> 00:17:16,350
I'm going to go to the next cavern over to
where we killed those umber hulks?

445
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:17,112
MATT: Yes.

446
00:17:17,112 --> 00:17:19,639
SAM: Take one of the umber hulk heads and put it
on a stick.

447
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,071
LAURA: Ooh.

448
00:17:21,071 --> 00:17:24,381
SAM: Right out front of where we're-- Of where
we're camping as sort of a warning to others.

449
00:17:24,436 --> 00:17:25,390
MATT: All right.

450
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,146
MARISHA: I want to check out--

451
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:27,084
LAURA: How about this?

452
00:17:27,084 --> 00:17:29,638
ORION: How many cavern entrances are there from
where we're camping?

453
00:17:29,638 --> 00:17:30,571
MATT: From where you are?

454
00:17:30,571 --> 00:17:31,505
(creepy music sound effect)

455
00:17:31,505 --> 00:17:32,620
LAURA: Oh no!

456
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,979
MATT: There are where you came in through--

457
00:17:33,979 --> 00:17:34,720
ORION: Right.

458
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,756
MATT: Strange things afoot echo in the silence.
There's the entrance you came in. Across the way,

459
00:17:39,824 --> 00:17:44,306
there appears to be another cavern that you can
kinda see the entrance to. Those are the only proper

460
00:17:44,306 --> 00:17:50,543
openings into this giant chamber. Otherwise
there's just the giant, over-arching cave that you

461
00:17:50,786 --> 00:17:53,819
guys are just getting into. Just pushing through,
so--

462
00:17:53,819 --> 00:17:55,541
MARISHA: I'm gonna take the first watch--

463
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:56,514
LAURA: Oh, you are! Okay.

464
00:17:56,514 --> 00:18:00,215
MARISHA: I still have a lot of reading to do, and
I can go ahead-- I'm gonna go ahead and cast--

465
00:18:00,215 --> 00:18:02,209
Make sure everybody's in! Everybody's in.

466
00:18:02,209 --> 00:18:03,862
LAURA: Wait, wait! I want to check the bodies of
the other guys before the--

467
00:18:03,862 --> 00:18:05,121
SAM: What are you casting? What are you about to
cast?

468
00:18:05,174 --> 00:18:06,000
MATT: Duergar?

469
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,275
LAURA: Yeah.

470
00:18:07,326 --> 00:18:08,379
MARISHA: Anti-Life Shell?

471
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:09,359
MATT: Go ahead and make an investigative check.

472
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:11,308
MARISHA: A shell that keeps in anything from
coming in.

473
00:18:11,308 --> 00:18:12,507
SAM: Oh. Great. Well, before you do that, hold
on.

474
00:18:12,507 --> 00:18:13,449
LAURA: A 20?

475
00:18:13,449 --> 00:18:18,872
MATT: Okay. Glancing about, you pull roughly 125
gold pieces between the three corpses of the

476
00:18:18,872 --> 00:18:23,400
duergar. Well, two corpses because one of them is
gone. It washed downstream.

477
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,358
LAURA: Right.

478
00:18:24,358 --> 00:18:25,416
LIAM: She had all the good things.

479
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,315
LAURA: She had a lot of good stuff on her.

480
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:34,402
MATT: Yeah. You do, however, find on one of them a
gnarled implement of some kind, whether it be

481
00:18:34,402 --> 00:18:39,340
scavenged or not. It's of a strange, like almost
bleached bone ivory

482
00:18:39,501 --> 00:18:42,132
that comes to a point at one end.

483
00:18:42,196 --> 00:18:44,757
ORION: Ooh.

484
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,450
SAM: Let's look at it. (laughs)

485
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:47,649
MATT: It is pretty.

486
00:18:47,649 --> 00:18:49,154
LAURA: Ooh, let me see, let me see.

487
00:18:49,154 --> 00:18:51,090
ORION: An artifact we can bring back to--

488
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:53,481
SAM: Can I take a look at it and--

489
00:18:53,481 --> 00:18:55,669
LIAM: Give it to Tiberius. He'll try anything.

490
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:57,215
MARISHA: (laughs) He'll try anything.

491
00:18:57,215 --> 00:18:58,773
SAM: History or-- or arcane?

492
00:18:58,773 --> 00:18:59,728
ORION: I like trying things.

493
00:18:59,728 --> 00:19:00,754
MATT: Go ahead and roll arcana.

494
00:19:00,754 --> 00:19:02,942
SAM: Arcana. No! (laughs)

495
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:04,020
MARISHA: (laughs) Oh, Scanlan.

496
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,095
MATT: Scanlan, it is a very pretty something.

497
00:19:06,095 --> 00:19:07,021
ORION: 24.

498
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:15,530
MATT: 24. Want to hand it over to him?

499
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:16,904
ORION: Yes, I--

500
00:19:16,904 --> 00:19:17,904
SAM: Ooh!

501
00:19:17,904 --> 00:19:18,780
LAURA: What is it?

502
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,539
SAM: Nothing.

503
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:22,266
ORION: Wonderful, this is. Wonderful. Magic
Missiles, of course.

504
00:19:22,266 --> 00:19:22,955
MARISHA: (laughs)

505
00:19:22,955 --> 00:19:24,589
SAM: It sends out magic missiles!

506
00:19:24,589 --> 00:19:25,446
LAURA: What!

507
00:19:25,446 --> 00:19:28,932
ORION: This one has seven charges. While holding
it, you, you can use an action to expend one or

508
00:19:28,932 --> 00:19:32,938
more of its charges to cast the Magic Missile
spell from it. For one charge, you cast the

509
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:38,465
first-level version of the spell. You can increase
the spell slot by one for each level by each

510
00:19:38,518 --> 00:19:44,606
additional charge you expend. The wand regains 1d6
+ 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend

511
00:19:44,606 --> 00:19:47,823
the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a one, the
wand crumples into ashes and then--

512
00:19:47,823 --> 00:19:48,863
LIAM: This all seems very technical.

513
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,806
LAURA: Yes, that's awesome--

514
00:19:49,806 --> 00:19:51,728
SAM: Basically it shoots out six missiles and then
it--

515
00:19:51,728 --> 00:19:52,826
LAURA: Awesome!

516
00:19:52,826 --> 00:19:53,698
TRAVIS: Isn't that a famous, like--

517
00:19:53,698 --> 00:19:54,601
MARISHA: It goes pew pew!

518
00:19:54,601 --> 00:19:55,800
LAURA: I'm glad we killed them before they used
that on us.

519
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,714
LIAM: Yes, it's pretty standard.

520
00:19:56,714 --> 00:19:57,488
TALIESIN: It's a pew pew stick.

521
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:58,189
LIAM: Pretty standard.

522
00:19:58,189 --> 00:19:58,970
MARISHA: It's a pew pew stick!

523
00:19:58,970 --> 00:19:59,612
LIAM: Yes.

524
00:19:59,612 --> 00:20:00,160
MARISHA: Cool!

525
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,551
ORION: Would anybody like to tinker? I mean, I
learned this when I was 12.

526
00:20:02,551 --> 00:20:04,525
(all laugh)

527
00:20:04,525 --> 00:20:05,645
LAURA: No, you're unconscious.

528
00:20:05,645 --> 00:20:07,620
ORION: Oh, I'll hold onto it--

529
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,107
LAURA: Well, yeah. Yeah.

530
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:11,234
LIAM: I think Grog may have soiled himself a
little.

531
00:20:11,234 --> 00:20:13,707
We should probably get Keyleth on the books.

532
00:20:13,707 --> 00:20:14,788
LAURA: Take a nap so that, maybe--

533
00:20:14,788 --> 00:20:15,547
TALIESIN: Yes.

534
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,215
MARISHA: Make sure everyone's in and close by, and
get done with everything.

535
00:20:18,215 --> 00:20:18,878
LAURA: Okay, she's gonna--

536
00:20:18,878 --> 00:20:20,232
LIAM: Keyleth, you need to study, so we'll take
first watch.

537
00:20:20,232 --> 00:20:21,021
MARISHA: I'm gonna take you guys--

538
00:20:21,021 --> 00:20:22,292
LAURA: Oh, that's true, you should study while we
watch.

539
00:20:22,292 --> 00:20:23,451
LIAM: You can't study and watch.

540
00:20:23,451 --> 00:20:28,142
MARISHA: I'm gonna cast Anti-Life Shell. That way
everyone at least gets one good hour of sleep.

541
00:20:28,232 --> 00:20:29,396
LAURA: Oh, good! I like it!

542
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:30,247
LIAM: All right, let's take a nap.

543
00:20:30,247 --> 00:20:31,316
LAURA: All right.

544
00:20:31,316 --> 00:20:35,244
MATT: You go ahead and you eventually find one of the
corpses of the umber hulk. It takes you a good 25

545
00:20:35,244 --> 00:20:41,319
minutes to eventually carve through its relatively
thick hide, chitinous exterior. You put the head

546
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:46,902
on a makeshift spike, and it is now there on
display.

547
00:20:46,902 --> 00:20:48,831
SAM: Yes, as a warning to others.

548
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:49,798
MATT: You feel accomplished.

549
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:50,486
SAM: Yes.

550
00:20:50,486 --> 00:20:52,653
MATT: You head back. Keyleth--

551
00:20:52,705 --> 00:20:53,917
TALIESIN: Terrible taxidermy attempt.

552
00:20:53,917 --> 00:20:57,622
MATT: -- as you are taking first watch, you notice
that the campsite that the duergar were using,

553
00:20:57,672 --> 00:21:04,024
where you guys are currently resting for the
evening, it's been there for a while and it

554
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:08,587
looks like the duergar have repurposed it. The
fire-- the stones that were set up around the

555
00:21:08,587 --> 00:21:12,377
actual fire pit have probably been there for quite
some time, and were set up very uniformly and very

556
00:21:12,377 --> 00:21:22,047
well placed. Right above you, on one of the stone
walls, you see what appears to be a strange, very

557
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:28,749
well carved symbol. Hard to recognize it. Go ahead
and make a religion check.

558
00:21:28,749 --> 00:21:29,708
LAURA: Oh, man.

559
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:33,761
MARISHA: Ugh, wish Pike were here.

560
00:21:33,761 --> 00:21:35,770
LIAM: Yes, we wish Pike was here.

561
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,775
LAURA: Pike's missing everything! (sobs)

562
00:21:37,775 --> 00:21:39,473
TALIESIN: Very much.

563
00:21:39,641 --> 00:21:41,038
ORION: Yes. We miss you!

564
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:42,293
MARISHA: Eight?

565
00:21:42,293 --> 00:21:43,583
LIAM: Come back, little gnome!

566
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:47,374
MATT: It's just a really interesting carving on
the wall just

567
00:21:47,374 --> 00:21:49,488
right above where you guys are 
currently residing--

568
00:21:49,488 --> 00:21:50,312
TALIESIN: Ampersand.

569
00:21:50,312 --> 00:21:51,067
MARISHA: So pretty!

570
00:21:51,067 --> 00:21:53,686
MATT: Not quite catching your attention, but it
seems to have some significance. And it's fresh,

571
00:21:53,686 --> 00:21:56,879
it's not like an ancient symbol that's been there,
it maybe could have

572
00:21:56,879 --> 00:21:58,256
been there for more than a week or two.

573
00:21:58,256 --> 00:22:01,075
MARISHA: I go ahead and I take a piece of paper
from my spellbook,

574
00:22:01,075 --> 00:22:07,422
and I take a piece of charcoal, and I just scroll 
over top of it.

575
00:22:07,422 --> 00:22:08,068
MATT: Okay.

576
00:22:08,068 --> 00:22:09,275
MARISHA: To get an imprint of it.

577
00:22:09,275 --> 00:22:13,185
MATT: Okay, it's very big. It's like four feet by
three feet.

578
00:22:13,185 --> 00:22:15,092
MARISHA: I take a few pieces of paper, and I kind
of glue them together-

579
00:22:15,092 --> 00:22:17,865
(all laugh)

580
00:22:17,865 --> 00:22:18,623
MATT: All right.

581
00:22:18,623 --> 00:22:22,689
MARISHA: -- and then I get a really big one, and
then I roll it up.

582
00:22:22,689 --> 00:22:31,012
MATT: All right. All right, you guys begin to set
up for the next watch. After the first hour--

583
00:22:31,012 --> 00:22:32,407
MARISHA: And I have my Anti-Life Shell up.

584
00:22:32,407 --> 00:22:36,042
MATT: Yep, Anti-Life Shell eventually fades, first
hour without any impact or issue.

585
00:22:36,042 --> 00:22:37,534
MARISHA: Who is taking the next watch?

586
00:22:37,534 --> 00:22:38,779
LAURA: Oh, we are.

587
00:22:38,779 --> 00:22:39,586
LIAM: Yeah.

588
00:22:39,586 --> 00:22:44,139
MATT: Okay. The next few hours go by without
incident.

589
00:22:44,139 --> 00:22:50,009
LAURA: That's nice. Can I look around and see-- I
mean, no! In our area! I'm not gonna wander off,

590
00:22:50,009 --> 00:22:57,698
but just to see if I see any kind of anything
interesting. I mean, if this is a really old area

591
00:22:57,698 --> 00:23:02,101
that I've noticed, it's old, can I see anything
cool and old around us?

592
00:23:02,101 --> 00:23:08,367
MATT: Well, there's a lot of mineral deposits.
This place in particular, it's definitely, because

593
00:23:08,367 --> 00:23:13,643
of the heavy river flow for a long time, a lot of
the area near the river itself, very smooth stone.

594
00:23:13,643 --> 00:23:17,014
A lot of kind of accumulated deposits of various
elements.

595
00:23:17,014 --> 00:23:24,027
You also catch the strange carved symbol right 
atop your guys' camp.

596
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:28,743
LAURA: Okay. So I tap my brother and go, look at
this. Do you know anything about religion?

597
00:23:28,743 --> 00:23:31,014
LIAM: (sighs) Well, let me see.

598
00:23:31,014 --> 00:23:31,829
LAURA: Let me see.

599
00:23:31,829 --> 00:23:34,321
(all laugh)

600
00:23:34,321 --> 00:23:35,977
LIAM: Well, I seem to know fuck-all about it.
Ten.

601
00:23:35,977 --> 00:23:37,470
LAURA: Oh, me too! I know shit about it.

602
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,284
MATT: It's a very fancy symbol.

603
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:40,657
LAURA: It's a really pretty symbol.

604
00:23:40,657 --> 00:23:43,392
MATT: You guys finish your watch--

605
00:23:43,392 --> 00:23:45,340
LIAM: I really wish Pike was here.

606
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,282
MARISHA: Just, the party is taking turns being
like, so pretty!

607
00:23:47,282 --> 00:23:48,139
LAURA: I know!

608
00:23:48,139 --> 00:23:49,427
SAM: Where was that symbol?

609
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:50,277
LAURA: On a rock.

610
00:23:50,277 --> 00:23:50,920
MARISHA: It's above our--

611
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,178
MATT: It's on one of the large cave surfaces near
where you guys are camping.

612
00:23:53,178 --> 00:23:57,587
LAURA: I don't see any cool sparkly things in the
mineral deposits? None of that?

613
00:23:57,587 --> 00:23:58,697
MATT: Nothing catches your attention--

614
00:23:58,697 --> 00:23:59,342
LAURA: Damn it!

615
00:23:59,342 --> 00:24:00,890
MATT: --- at the moment, no, unfortunately.

616
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:01,591
LIAM: All about the bling.

617
00:24:01,591 --> 00:24:02,828
LAURA: I am about the bling.

618
00:24:02,828 --> 00:24:04,075
MARISHA: How's it going over there, Grog?

619
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:05,264
MATT: You finish your watch without issue.

620
00:24:05,264 --> 00:24:06,106
MARISHA: It's good.

621
00:24:06,106 --> 00:24:08,645
MATT: Next up watch, this is the last, third, and
final watch you guys are now going through.

622
00:24:08,645 --> 00:24:09,420
ORION: Oh, all right.

623
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,615
SAM: I'll come with Tiberius as well.

624
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:11,173
MATT: Okay.

625
00:24:11,173 --> 00:24:12,387
TALIESIN: Yeah, we'll all go.

626
00:24:12,438 --> 00:24:13,300
SAM: Okay.

627
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:18,386
MATT: Okay. The three of you guys keep watch.
After they're napping. Occasionally you have to

628
00:24:18,386 --> 00:24:20,753
adjust Grog, 'cause you're not sure if he's still
breathing.

629
00:24:20,753 --> 00:24:21,901
ORION: I'll roll for the--

630
00:24:21,901 --> 00:24:23,044
TRAVIS: What?

631
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:24,947
SAM: Not sure if he's still breathing?

632
00:24:24,947 --> 00:24:26,102
ORION: I'm gonna do an intelligence, right?

633
00:24:26,102 --> 00:24:26,835
MATT: To make sure he's still--

634
00:24:26,835 --> 00:24:27,529
LAURA: What?

635
00:24:27,529 --> 00:24:28,489
MARISHA: Religion. Religion.

636
00:24:28,489 --> 00:24:29,122
MATT: Religion.

637
00:24:29,122 --> 00:24:30,110
ORION: 20.

638
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,437
LAURA: Oh my god, what if you could die while
we're sleeping?

639
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:32,246
MATT: Right now, you just rolled?

640
00:24:32,246 --> 00:24:33,141
ORION: Well, 18 plus two.

641
00:24:33,141 --> 00:24:34,559
MATT: Oh, okay.

642
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:35,420
ORION: What's that?

643
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:38,118
MATT: You are familiar with this symbol
specifically because of your background. That is

644
00:24:38,118 --> 00:24:40,720
the symbol of Bahamut. It is the symbol of the
Platinum Dragon.

645
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,064
LAURA: Ooh!

646
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:44,894
MATT: And you ascertain it was probably--

647
00:24:44,894 --> 00:24:46,277
ORION: Oh, it looks like this!

648
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:46,988
MATT: Yes.

649
00:24:46,988 --> 00:24:47,820
ORION: Oh, interesting.

650
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:52,384
MATT: And it was probably used as part of some
sort of a protection ritual.

651
00:24:52,384 --> 00:24:55,323
LAURA: What was the name of the bad guy that she
said?

652
00:24:55,323 --> 00:24:56,863
MATT: K'varn.

653
00:24:56,863 --> 00:24:58,566
ORION: I tell everybody that. Well, that I'm
with.

654
00:24:58,566 --> 00:24:59,412
LAURA: Thank you.

655
00:24:59,412 --> 00:25:00,729
MATT: Using the thing you wrote.

656
00:25:00,729 --> 00:25:01,764
LAURA: K'varn.

657
00:25:01,764 --> 00:25:02,730
MATT: K'varn.

658
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:04,676
LAURA: I'm gonna guess that's how you spell it.

659
00:25:04,676 --> 00:25:07,737
ORION: It seems it's a protective symbol of sorts,
but it's of Bahamut, which is a good thing.

660
00:25:07,737 --> 00:25:09,616
LAURA: K'vah? I thought it was K'varn.

661
00:25:09,616 --> 00:25:10,440
SAM: It's a good thing?

662
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,301
ORION: Bahamut is the essentially nicer deity of
the two between him

663
00:25:14,301 --> 00:25:16,985
and Tiamat, which is a total asshole, but--

664
00:25:16,985 --> 00:25:20,164
SAM: Well that must be why Lady Kima came down
here.

665
00:25:20,164 --> 00:25:23,761
ORION: Right. So she must have camped here, put
this symbol up for protection.

666
00:25:23,761 --> 00:25:28,421
MATT: As you are having this discussion, you feel
a slight rumble in the ground.

667
00:25:28,421 --> 00:25:29,408
TRAVIS: Fucked up now.

668
00:25:29,408 --> 00:25:31,117
MARISHA: Oh no.

669
00:25:31,117 --> 00:25:34,128
MATT: Some of the rocks nearby, the loose pebbles,
begin to vibrate and move around.

670
00:25:34,128 --> 00:25:35,240
ORION: Oh dear.

671
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,971
SAM: Grog's probably farting again.

672
00:25:37,971 --> 00:25:40,078
ORION: No, I don't think-- I think we should alert
the others.

673
00:25:40,078 --> 00:25:41,017
SAM: All right.

674
00:25:41,017 --> 00:25:43,792
LAURA: We're waking up, we're waking up. Don't
worry, we are gonna heal you.

675
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:44,820
ORION: How far are we from everybody? We're just
like--

676
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:45,974
MATT: You guys are all clustered in the small
camp.

677
00:25:45,974 --> 00:25:46,722
ORION: Oh.

678
00:25:46,722 --> 00:25:50,621
SAM: Let's quietly wake them, and I will go peer
into the darkness and see if I can see them.

679
00:25:50,621 --> 00:25:53,914
ORION: Rumbling is never a good thing, Scanlan.

680
00:25:53,914 --> 00:25:55,378
LAURA: Something's rumbling? I wasn't paying
attention.

681
00:25:55,378 --> 00:25:57,362
MATT: Do you still have your light source up,
Light, or you just, the campfire?

682
00:25:57,362 --> 00:25:58,613
ORION: Just the campfire.

683
00:25:58,613 --> 00:26:02,539
MATT: Yeah, you are-- outside of just, maybe 15,
20 feet, you see nothing. It's pitch black.

684
00:26:02,539 --> 00:26:06,194
TALIESIN: Let's wake everybody up, and then we'll
get to work--

685
00:26:06,194 --> 00:26:07,425
LAURA: On healing Grog?

686
00:26:07,425 --> 00:26:09,099
TALIESIN: -- on Grog, and go see what that is.

687
00:26:09,099 --> 00:26:10,422
LAURA: I'm not awake yet.

688
00:26:10,422 --> 00:26:11,812
TALIESIN: Is all this going at the same time?

689
00:26:11,812 --> 00:26:13,720
SAM: Is the rumbling continuous, or is it just one
little rumble?

690
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,076
MATT: A few moments pass, the rumbling has
subsided.

691
00:26:16,076 --> 00:26:16,896
SAM: Oh, okay.

692
00:26:16,896 --> 00:26:17,598
ORION: Oh, it stopped.

693
00:26:17,598 --> 00:26:18,596
SAM: Oh, easy!

694
00:26:18,596 --> 00:26:19,470
LAURA: So we're awake.

695
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:20,459
MARISHA: Okay, but let's--

696
00:26:20,459 --> 00:26:21,579
LAURA: Let's heal this guy. Can you heal him?

697
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:22,791
MARISHA: Am I awake? Are we awake? Did you wake me
up?

698
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:23,588
LAURA: Are we awake?

699
00:26:23,588 --> 00:26:24,622
ORION: I do Prestidigitation and wake everybody
up--

700
00:26:24,622 --> 00:26:26,068
LAURA: (grunts) Awake.

701
00:26:26,068 --> 00:26:27,622
ORION: -- with a little spritz of water in the
face.

702
00:26:27,622 --> 00:26:28,503
MATT: Okay, all wake up--

703
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,031
ORION: Everybody get up!

704
00:26:30,031 --> 00:26:31,109
SAM: Like the flower, the flower trick?

705
00:26:31,109 --> 00:26:32,301
MARISHA: Why water? Why would you do that?

706
00:26:32,301 --> 00:26:33,087
ORION: Yeah.

707
00:26:33,087 --> 00:26:34,498
MARISHA: Why couldn't you just touch me?

708
00:26:34,498 --> 00:26:35,343
TALIESIN: Magic bukkake.

709
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:36,072
ORION: Because it's--

710
00:26:36,072 --> 00:26:36,971
LAURA: Ah, that was a good nap!

711
00:26:36,971 --> 00:26:37,808
LIAM: Stupid lizard.

712
00:26:37,808 --> 00:26:38,574
MARISHA: Ugh.

713
00:26:38,574 --> 00:26:39,784
LAURA: I think Grog farted again.

714
00:26:39,784 --> 00:26:40,794
ORION: I do it again, and clean everybody up.

715
00:26:40,794 --> 00:26:41,720
MARISHA: Stop!

716
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,404
ORION: Sorry. sorry! It's off. I--

717
00:26:43,404 --> 00:26:44,331
SAM: Something terrible is brewing.

718
00:26:44,331 --> 00:26:45,566
LAURA: Keyleth-- no, what?

719
00:26:45,566 --> 00:26:48,733
SAM: How is everyone feeling? Do we need to heal?
Everyone?

720
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:49,729
LAURA: We need to heal this guy.

721
00:26:49,729 --> 00:26:50,925
SAM: No, what about us? How are we feeling?

722
00:26:50,925 --> 00:26:51,822
LIAM: Well, we all just slept, so we're fine.

723
00:26:51,822 --> 00:26:52,806
LAURA: We're fine! Heal this guy!

724
00:26:52,806 --> 00:26:53,499
MARISHA: I'm okay.

725
00:26:53,499 --> 00:26:54,411
SAM: Are we okay?

726
00:26:54,411 --> 00:26:55,451
MATT: You've all slept for the evening--

727
00:26:55,451 --> 00:26:56,271
ORION: Oh, awesome.

728
00:26:56,271 --> 00:26:57,735
MATT: --and from the points of your unused--

729
00:26:57,735 --> 00:26:59,813
LAURA: Grog, just wait a little bit longer.

730
00:26:59,813 --> 00:27:01,811
MATT: -- healing dice, you're pretty much all at
max health, so.

731
00:27:01,811 --> 00:27:02,649
LAURA: You'll be okay.

732
00:27:02,649 --> 00:27:04,712
MARISHA: Okay, do we wanna stay here? Do we wanna
do this here?

733
00:27:04,712 --> 00:27:05,494
LAURA: Yeah! Do it here!

734
00:27:05,494 --> 00:27:06,219
TALIESIN: Do this here.

735
00:27:06,219 --> 00:27:08,863
ORION: There was a rumble. Okay, we need to get
Grog, the others, and--

736
00:27:08,863 --> 00:27:10,393
LAURA: How long will this take, Keyleth?

737
00:27:10,393 --> 00:27:16,024
MARISHA: Tiberius-- I don't know. But I want us to
be as safe as we can. Tiberius, can you lift us up

738
00:27:16,024 --> 00:27:18,194
on your pillars, or like, encase us in, or
something? Make us a room?

739
00:27:18,194 --> 00:27:20,130
ORION: I was just about to do that!

740
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,558
MARISHA: Make us a room?

741
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:22,169
ORION: Yes!

742
00:27:22,169 --> 00:27:23,477
MARISHA: Yes? Okay.

743
00:27:23,477 --> 00:27:24,672
ORION: But everybody hates when I do that.

744
00:27:24,672 --> 00:27:25,900
SAM: Are you gonna cast a spell now?

745
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,317
MARISHA: We're gonna do this.

746
00:27:27,317 --> 00:27:31,388
SAM: Okay, I'd like to give her a little
inspirational song.

747
00:27:31,388 --> 00:27:32,555
MARISHA: Yes, if you could.

748
00:27:32,555 --> 00:27:33,295
MATT: All right.

749
00:27:33,295 --> 00:27:37,129
MARISHA: Scanlan, give me some nice meditation,
some--

750
00:27:37,129 --> 00:27:39,001
SAM: Okay, some, like, yoga music?

751
00:27:39,001 --> 00:27:40,563
MARISHA: Some, like, pure moods. Yes! Yes.

752
00:27:40,563 --> 00:27:43,532
LAURA: Trinket gives her a massage beforehand to
loosen her up.

753
00:27:43,582 --> 00:27:44,660
MARISHA: I go ahead--

754
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:48,393
SAM: (sings) You know you got to cure Grog.

755
00:27:48,393 --> 00:27:52,010
MARISHA: I go ahead and light some incense.

756
00:27:52,173 --> 00:27:53,180
ORION: Wonderful tune.

757
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:59,614
MARISHA: Scanlan. Scanlan, do you still have that
deity, that little idol of Pike?

758
00:27:59,614 --> 00:28:01,967
SAM: I do have my idol of Pike, yes!

759
00:28:01,967 --> 00:28:04,030
MARISHA: Can we just have that out just so I have
her energy.

760
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,538
SAM: Oh, of course!

761
00:28:05,538 --> 00:28:06,571
MARISHA: Just feel like I need her.

762
00:28:06,571 --> 00:28:08,720
SAM: I take out the idol of Pike that I keep
always close to my loins,

763
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,961
and I hold it tightly, and warmly--

764
00:28:11,961 --> 00:28:12,568
MARISHA: Okay.

765
00:28:12,568 --> 00:28:14,501
SAM: -- and caress it a little.

766
00:28:14,501 --> 00:28:15,798
ORION: Give it to her.

767
00:28:15,798 --> 00:28:19,416
MATT: It is momentarily distracting, but
eventually you phase it out.

768
00:28:19,416 --> 00:28:20,497
All right, so as you guys--

769
00:28:20,497 --> 00:28:21,421
(all laugh)

770
00:28:21,421 --> 00:28:23,337
ORION: Did you want my hand or the statue?

771
00:28:23,337 --> 00:28:26,239
MATT: You take a bit of earth from a pouch that
you keep of your--

772
00:28:26,239 --> 00:28:27,038
ORION: Statue.

773
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:31,380
MATT: -- home tribe where you grew up. You
scattered some of it around Grog, who is now laid

774
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:34,022
on his back, whose arms and legs, all equally
stretched out.

775
00:28:34,022 --> 00:28:35,017
TRAVIS: Naked.

776
00:28:35,017 --> 00:28:36,473
MATT: No. You're still clothed.

777
00:28:36,473 --> 00:28:39,245
(all laugh)

778
00:28:39,245 --> 00:28:41,542
MARISHA: Let's not go there. No need to be naked.

779
00:28:41,542 --> 00:28:42,899
LAURA: There's coffee next to you.

780
00:28:42,899 --> 00:28:47,473
MATT: As this is the first time you've attempted a
magic of this type, you close your eyes and take

781
00:28:47,473 --> 00:28:51,983
in the earth's essence. As a druid, being
connected to nature is

782
00:28:51,983 --> 00:28:54,578
where you draw your divine energy. You kind of--

783
00:28:54,578 --> 00:28:55,434
MARISHA: I'm so nervous.

784
00:28:55,434 --> 00:29:00,158
MATT: -- almost take from the vibration of the
nearby caverns that you felt, and come in tune

785
00:29:00,225 --> 00:29:03,334
with the way the earth, the planet itself shifts
and moves, you--

786
00:29:03,334 --> 00:29:04,446
LIAM: You got this, Keyleth! You got this!

787
00:29:04,446 --> 00:29:05,708
LAURA: You can do this Keyleth! You can do this!

788
00:29:05,708 --> 00:29:06,782
MARISHA: I'm literally shaking.

789
00:29:06,782 --> 00:29:09,767
MATT: You use that to give constitutional strength
to the physical form

790
00:29:09,767 --> 00:29:11,861
of Grog in hopes of restoring him.

791
00:29:11,861 --> 00:29:13,970
MARISHA: Okay, I just kind of lay my hands on his
forehead.

792
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:16,274
LAURA: Oh my gosh!

793
00:29:16,274 --> 00:29:25,197
SAM: You know, I know Grog very well, and he might
enjoy, or be inspired by, a kiss of a female. I'm

794
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:31,595
just saying, just the gentle kiss of a female lips
on his might rouse him.

795
00:29:31,595 --> 00:29:32,517
ORION: Ooh, Vex!

796
00:29:32,517 --> 00:29:33,522
SAM: I've seen it many times.

797
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:34,456
ORION: You should plant one on him.

798
00:29:34,456 --> 00:29:37,866
SAM: Vex? Get in there! Get in there!

799
00:29:37,866 --> 00:29:39,545
(all laugh)

800
00:29:39,545 --> 00:29:41,787
MATT: As Vex awkwardly fumbles over the--

801
00:29:41,787 --> 00:29:42,862
LAURA: I think it helped.

802
00:29:42,862 --> 00:29:47,542
MATT: -- the overtly sized goliath-

803
00:29:47,542 --> 00:29:50,773
LAURA: Stop it.

804
00:29:50,773 --> 00:29:52,742
TRAVIS: Not all dead.

805
00:29:52,742 --> 00:29:55,254
MATT: Go ahead and--

806
00:29:55,254 --> 00:29:56,792
LIAM: Just upstairs.

807
00:29:56,792 --> 00:29:58,256
MARISHA: Do I get an inspiration die from him or
anything?

808
00:29:58,256 --> 00:29:59,009
MATT: You do, yes.

809
00:29:59,009 --> 00:30:01,310
MARISHA: Okay. What am I rolling? What do I do?

810
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,439
MATT: Roll a d20, add your wisdom modifier.

811
00:30:02,439 --> 00:30:03,841
LAURA: Do I get to assist since I gave him a
kiss?

812
00:30:03,841 --> 00:30:06,580
MATT: No assistance on this. This only affects a
d20 roll.

813
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,735
SAM: d20.

814
00:30:07,735 --> 00:30:09,211
LAURA: Oh god.

815
00:30:09,211 --> 00:30:10,071
TALIESIN: It's a wisdom modifier.

816
00:30:10,071 --> 00:30:11,172
SAM: Let's do this, man.

817
00:30:11,172 --> 00:30:11,911
LIAM: Save Grog!

818
00:30:11,911 --> 00:30:13,372
LAURA: Save Grog. Save Grog!

819
00:30:13,372 --> 00:30:14,408
SAM: For the chat room.

820
00:30:14,408 --> 00:30:19,884
MARISHA: Gah. Nauseous. No.

821
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:23,057
MATT: What'd you roll? What'd you roll?

822
00:30:23,057 --> 00:30:24,502
LAURA: No!

823
00:30:24,502 --> 00:30:26,489
MARISHA: Where's the inspiration die? Where's the
inspiration die?

824
00:30:26,489 --> 00:30:27,521
ORION: Didn't you get advantage on that?

825
00:30:27,521 --> 00:30:28,247
MARISHA: It's a d8, right?

826
00:30:28,247 --> 00:30:28,973
MATT: It's a d8.

827
00:30:28,973 --> 00:30:30,418
MARISHA: Do I get advantage on this, since I'm
taking time?

828
00:30:30,418 --> 00:30:31,059
LAURA: Yes!

829
00:30:31,059 --> 00:30:32,672
MATT: As is, yes, yeah, you have advantage on the
roll, yeah!

830
00:30:32,672 --> 00:30:33,617
MARISHA: I <i>do</i> have advantage on this?

831
00:30:33,617 --> 00:30:34,934
LAURA: Come on, Keyleth! Keyleth, Keyleth,
Keyleth!

832
00:30:34,934 --> 00:30:37,961
ORION: Yeah!

833
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:38,983
MARISHA: Oh, that's much better!

834
00:30:38,983 --> 00:30:39,913
LAURA: What? What was it?

835
00:30:39,913 --> 00:30:42,703
MARISHA: I'm still gonna do the inspiration dice,
just in casies. Okay, that's good.

836
00:30:42,703 --> 00:30:43,350
TALIESIN: That's good.

837
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,136
MARISHA: Okay, so.

838
00:30:44,136 --> 00:30:45,012
MATT: What's the total?

839
00:30:45,012 --> 00:30:46,218
MARISHA: 17 plus 12.

840
00:30:46,218 --> 00:30:47,435
MATT: Plus 12?

841
00:30:47,435 --> 00:30:53,245
MARISHA: Plus six, plus six with my wisdom
modifier. My heart is pounding.

842
00:30:53,245 --> 00:30:56,920
So that's 30? No, 29.

843
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,563
MATT: 29, that should be enough.

844
00:30:58,563 --> 00:30:59,582
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

845
00:30:59,582 --> 00:31:07,058
MATT: So, (laughs), in this circumstance, you
complete the ritual.

846
00:31:07,058 --> 00:31:09,264
There's a brief glow of all the--

847
00:31:09,264 --> 00:31:11,135
MARISHA: Ah, I'm still shaking.

848
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:14,361
MATT: The dirt that you'd scattered around Grog,
and you can see his form kind of take in a deeper

849
00:31:14,361 --> 00:31:19,470
breath. His chest expands, and as it does, his
eyes, which currently stare off in space, begin to

850
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:23,815
clarify and crystallize and his brow quivers for a
second,

851
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:27,419
and you see a little bit of life return to his face.

852
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:32,168
TRAVIS: Ugh. Kittens. Ugh. Nachos. Ugh.

853
00:31:32,168 --> 00:31:33,213
SAM: (laughs)

854
00:31:33,213 --> 00:31:33,874
MARISHA: Grog?

855
00:31:33,874 --> 00:31:35,561
MATT: Grog, your sight focuses as the party is
gathered around you, looking down upon your

856
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:39,435
currently stretched out physical form in a cavern.
You're very confused.

857
00:31:39,435 --> 00:31:40,592
LIAM: Welcome back, big guy.

858
00:31:40,592 --> 00:31:43,785
TRAVIS: I thought I was in algebra class again for
a second there.

859
00:31:43,785 --> 00:31:44,861
(all laugh)

860
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:45,705
MARISHA: Grog!

861
00:31:45,705 --> 00:31:48,184
SAM: You're alive!

862
00:31:48,184 --> 00:31:49,223
ORION: Why are you all cheering?

863
00:31:49,223 --> 00:31:50,074
LAURA: Good job, Keyleth!

864
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:53,861
ORION: Why did you run out and destroy nothing?
Look what you did. You were giving me crap about

865
00:31:53,861 --> 00:31:55,683
the lightning. Don't ever do that again.

866
00:31:55,683 --> 00:31:58,577
TRAVIS: Sorry, who woke me up from my sleep?

867
00:31:58,639 --> 00:32:00,278
(electronic beep)

868
00:32:00,343 --> 00:32:01,790
LAURA: Oh, Siri did, apparently.

869
00:32:01,844 --> 00:32:04,021
ORION: It was a group effort really, but Keyleth
did an amazing job.

870
00:32:04,021 --> 00:32:07,309
TRAVIS: Keyleth? I run over and I give Keyleth a
big ol' bear hug,

871
00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:08,828
squeezing maybe a bit too tight.

872
00:32:08,828 --> 00:32:09,646
MARISHA: Ow.

873
00:32:09,646 --> 00:32:10,708
LAURA: I think he shit himself while he was
unconscious,

874
00:32:10,708 --> 00:32:13,508
so that's gotta smell really wonderful.

875
00:32:13,508 --> 00:32:17,968
TRAVIS: I smell better than I ever have before.

876
00:32:17,968 --> 00:32:23,164
MARISHA: Just glad you're all right, Grog. Really
glad you're awake.

877
00:32:23,164 --> 00:32:26,643
TRAVIS: I reach into the bag of holding and I get
the cask of ale and my goblet,

878
00:32:26,643 --> 00:32:30,555
and I pour a little goblet of ale and I give it 
to Keyleth.

879
00:32:30,555 --> 00:32:31,738
MARISHA: To Grog!

880
00:32:31,738 --> 00:32:33,437
ALL: To Grog!

881
00:32:33,437 --> 00:32:34,632
TRAVIS: To me!

882
00:32:34,632 --> 00:32:36,773
(all laugh)

883
00:32:36,773 --> 00:32:41,926
MATT: As a note too, just so you guys are aware,
20 is the stat cap for normal physical stats,

884
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:46,889
however magical items can then bump that up
higher. Just answering a chat room question.

885
00:32:46,889 --> 00:32:48,447
LAURA: Right.

886
00:32:48,447 --> 00:32:51,233
SAM: I don't even know what that means. Question
or the answer.

887
00:32:51,233 --> 00:32:52,852
MATT: That's okay. Don't worry about it.

888
00:32:52,852 --> 00:32:54,643
SAM: Hey. How is he doing, how is he feeling?

889
00:32:54,643 --> 00:32:55,827
TRAVIS: I'm so glad you had advantage on that.

890
00:32:55,827 --> 00:32:56,973
SAM: Grog, how are you feeling?

891
00:32:56,973 --> 00:32:57,743
ORION: Yes!

892
00:32:57,743 --> 00:32:58,620
SAM: How is he feeling?

893
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,268
TRAVIS: My intelligence is--

894
00:33:00,268 --> 00:33:01,718
What is it now?

895
00:33:01,769 --> 00:33:02,657
MATT: It's back to normal.

896
00:33:02,657 --> 00:33:04,167
MARISHA: At like the gym and you need some
alcohol, after that.

897
00:33:04,167 --> 00:33:05,221
TRAVIS: It's six, so--

898
00:33:05,221 --> 00:33:06,275
SAM: Right where it should be.

899
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:09,359
TRAVIS: I feel right as rain. What are we
killing?

900
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:11,080
(all laugh)

901
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,047
LIAM: Brains, apparently.

902
00:33:12,047 --> 00:33:14,400
SAM: How many fingers is this?

903
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,023
TRAVIS: Three.

904
00:33:15,023 --> 00:33:15,926
SAM: Perfect.

905
00:33:15,926 --> 00:33:17,784
MARISHA: Good, he's back, you guys. He's back.

906
00:33:17,784 --> 00:33:19,156
TRAVIS: Blue, oh no, hold on.

907
00:33:19,156 --> 00:33:20,095
MARISHA: Good.

908
00:33:20,095 --> 00:33:20,990
TRAVIS: Square!

909
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:24,802
ORION: I saunter over to Keyleth. That was mighty
impressive.

910
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:25,919
MARISHA: Oh, thank you.

911
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:27,249
ORION: That was amazing.

912
00:33:27,249 --> 00:33:29,714
MARISHA: I had Pike in mind. I channeled her
energy.

913
00:33:29,714 --> 00:33:32,403
SAM: It's true, it was quite astounding. I have a
little chub on.

914
00:33:32,403 --> 00:33:33,236
LAURA: (groans)

915
00:33:33,236 --> 00:33:34,554
TRAVIS: (laughs)

916
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,331
So do I, for some reason.

917
00:33:36,331 --> 00:33:38,395
LAURA: You're welcome.

918
00:33:38,395 --> 00:33:39,771
MARISHA: Yeah well, that's a bit of a side
effect.

919
00:33:39,821 --> 00:33:40,965
TRAVIS: It must be the morning.

920
00:33:40,965 --> 00:33:43,147
MARISHA: That's part of the Greater Restoration, a
few things get restored.

921
00:33:43,147 --> 00:33:44,481
MATT: (laughs)

922
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:46,053
TRAVIS: God bless you.

923
00:33:46,053 --> 00:33:49,160
LIAM: Do you remember anything about a kiss in
your dreams while you were asleep?

924
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:53,492
TRAVIS: Well, my cheeks are sort of sore for some
reason, as if they've been slapped repeatedly by a

925
00:33:53,492 --> 00:33:57,266
bunch of twats, and then I've got this one little
wet mark right here

926
00:33:57,266 --> 00:34:01,875
where I got a kiss and it smells like 
half-elvish spit.

927
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:04,490
LIAM: Oh, that was Trinket. Trinket helped with
the spell.

928
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:05,705
Gave you a kiss and helped wake you up.

929
00:34:05,705 --> 00:34:07,106
LAURA: Oh, why didn't I have Trinket--

930
00:34:07,106 --> 00:34:08,429
TALIESIN: And several slaps.

931
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:09,961
MATT: At which point you look over and Trinket is
there off to the side,

932
00:34:09,961 --> 00:34:12,825
notably excited that you're moving again. 
(bear noises)

933
00:34:12,825 --> 00:34:14,209
LAURA: Aw.

934
00:34:14,209 --> 00:34:16,329
MATT: Comes over and nuzzles up against you for a
moment.

935
00:34:16,329 --> 00:34:20,780
TRAVIS: Oh Trinket, you big ol' furball. 
Trinket noogie.

936
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,672
LAURA: (laughs)

937
00:34:22,672 --> 00:34:24,014
TRAVIS: Can we go kill something now?

938
00:34:24,014 --> 00:34:26,783
LAURA: Well shit, I guess we should. I think we
are all healed up.

939
00:34:26,783 --> 00:34:28,091
MATT: You guys all healed overnight.

940
00:34:28,091 --> 00:34:30,599
LAURA: Did he heal while he was unconscious?

941
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:33,699
MATT: You did not get an opportunity to use any of
your stuff, so you're currently still at the hit

942
00:34:33,867 --> 00:34:36,460
points you were, plus you naturally healed just
from the evening's rest.

943
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,014
TRAVIS: Oh, I did?

944
00:34:38,014 --> 00:34:40,266
MATT: Four hit points.

945
00:34:40,266 --> 00:34:45,129
SAM: Let's do some Grog healing. You don't have
your healing dice, right?

946
00:34:45,129 --> 00:34:46,418
TRAVIS: I do.

947
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:53,637
SAM: I'm gonna sing a song of rest for you, so
that'll add 1d6 to your healing rolls.

948
00:34:53,637 --> 00:35:01,858
TRAVIS: Yes! 11 plus-- All right. 12. Great.

949
00:35:01,858 --> 00:35:05,868
LAURA: How many d12s do you get to roll? You can
roll four of them if you need to.

950
00:35:05,936 --> 00:35:08,111
TRAVIS: (counts)

951
00:35:08,111 --> 00:35:09,325
MATT: You can roll up to nine.

952
00:35:09,325 --> 00:35:10,731
LAURA: You can roll up to nine dice.

953
00:35:10,753 --> 00:35:11,658
TRAVIS: Oh!

954
00:35:11,658 --> 00:35:13,160
MATT: Whatever your level is, that's how many dice
you can use.

955
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,579
TRAVIS: Nipple tassels! That's way better.

956
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:15,888
(all laugh)

957
00:35:15,888 --> 00:35:19,360
MATT: But that's for the day. Once you've used those
nine hit dice to heal yourself naturally, you are

958
00:35:19,427 --> 00:35:21,751
maxed out outside of magical healing or potions.

959
00:35:21,751 --> 00:35:22,797
TRAVIS: I've used two.

960
00:35:22,797 --> 00:35:24,520
SAM: Shall we tarry on, everyone?

961
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,201
LIAM: Yes, I have a feeling these tunnels are
going to suck majorly,

962
00:35:27,277 --> 00:35:30,283
but we have nowhere to go but down, so--

963
00:35:30,283 --> 00:35:32,755
LAURA: So we know which tunnel she pointed
towards?

964
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:36,547
MATT: She pointed towards the rest of the cavern,
which you have just stepped into.

965
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:42,302
LAURA: Can I use tracking and see if I can not
only see where the majority of tracks lead to, but

966
00:35:42,302 --> 00:35:47,556
see if I can spot the halfling Kima's tracks.

967
00:35:47,556 --> 00:35:49,606
MATT: Lady Kima. Go ahead and make a survival
check.

968
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:51,288
LAURA: Survival?

969
00:35:51,288 --> 00:35:54,296
MATT: Which you have advantage on simply for
tracking depending on what you're tracking.

970
00:35:54,296 --> 00:35:55,994
LAURA: I do!

971
00:35:55,994 --> 00:35:58,533
MATT: What are your favored enemies?

972
00:35:58,584 --> 00:36:02,858
LAURA: My favored enemies are dragons and demons.

973
00:36:02,858 --> 00:36:04,627
MATT: So you would not have advantage on this.

974
00:36:04,627 --> 00:36:06,163
LAURA: Ah, screw that

975
00:36:06,329 --> 00:36:07,228
MATT: That's okay. What did you roll?

976
00:36:07,228 --> 00:36:10,168
LAURA: Oh, but I do. Wait. My favored terrain is
the Underdark.

977
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:13,507
MATT: Okay. All right. For that, I will go ahead
and give you advantage on that. This is

978
00:36:13,507 --> 00:36:18,785
technically considered the crust of the Underdark.

979
00:36:18,785 --> 00:36:21,676
LAURA: That doesn't count if it rolls
onto a phone?

980
00:36:21,751 --> 00:36:23,297
LIAM: I think that's in this book.

981
00:36:23,297 --> 00:36:24,488
MATT: Yeah, yeah, I think it's chapter four.

982
00:36:24,488 --> 00:36:25,716
LAURA: 19 is what I rolled.

983
00:36:25,716 --> 00:36:30,874
MATT: 19. Okay. As you guys begin to move, you can
find, like, there is this waterfall. Which you can

984
00:36:30,874 --> 00:36:35,413
hear in the distance, there are a number of
cascading, crashing water sounds. So you imagine

985
00:36:35,413 --> 00:36:38,348
there are multiple layers as this cavern descends
down into the darkness.

986
00:36:38,348 --> 00:36:41,437
What are you using for a light source, by the way?

987
00:36:41,437 --> 00:36:42,436
LIAM: Tiberius, yeah?

988
00:36:42,436 --> 00:36:43,413
SAM: Tiberius, hit us.

989
00:36:43,413 --> 00:36:44,179
ORION: What's happening?

990
00:36:44,179 --> 00:36:44,829
SAM: Light

991
00:36:44,829 --> 00:36:48,486
TRAVIS: Oh, ah.

992
00:36:48,486 --> 00:36:50,032
(all laugh)

993
00:36:50,032 --> 00:36:51,175
MATT: The cavern comes alive with bright white
light.

994
00:36:51,175 --> 00:36:53,152
TRAVIS: Oh, right. Sunglasses.

995
00:36:53,152 --> 00:36:58,986
MATT: Using that, you take a while and you begin
to just keep tabs on the surface area of this

996
00:36:58,986 --> 00:37:02,783
cavern as you begin to move further down. You find
some portions where you can climb down to the lower

997
00:37:02,783 --> 00:37:08,267
levels. The first thing you notice is there are
definitive signs of struggle or intense running

998
00:37:08,335 --> 00:37:15,804
towards the direction that you came from. Meaning
things were seemingly either fleeing or heading

999
00:37:15,804 --> 00:37:22,346
that direction very quickly. Some of them appear
to be more recent than others. You also begin to

1000
00:37:22,346 --> 00:37:35,085
see a few partially decomposed corpses of various
goblinoid creatures. You find two goblins just

1001
00:37:35,085 --> 00:37:40,057
slain, just cut open, and off to the side you see
some of the skin is pulled tight against the bone

1002
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:45,801
as a lot of it is just rotting from the cave
itself. Not a very great smell. There have been

1003
00:37:45,801 --> 00:37:52,446
small pockets of struggle the more you progress
down this way. You also find some drag marks that

1004
00:37:52,446 --> 00:38:01,564
are similar to what you saw back in the mines, and
as you move forward and the light begins to open

1005
00:38:01,564 --> 00:38:08,174
up, you can see small pockets of that red stone
that's used to light a bunch of Kraghammer. You

1006
00:38:08,174 --> 00:38:12,679
can start seeing elements of it embedded in the
walls of the cavern ahead and just faintly giving

1007
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:18,334
this reddish glow and the outline of some shapes.
You begin to step into the outskirts about 60 feet

1008
00:38:18,334 --> 00:38:24,534
ahead of what looks like a series of huts, small
stone structures cobbled together with small stone

1009
00:38:24,534 --> 00:38:30,498
and stacked on each other. Simple driftwood and
broken pieces of scavenged material put into small

1010
00:38:30,498 --> 00:38:37,737
buildings. It's a very kinda ramshackle village
underground.

1011
00:38:37,737 --> 00:38:38,910
SAM: Let's burn it down.

1012
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:41,255
LIAM: I am stealthing. I roll stealth.

1013
00:38:41,255 --> 00:38:42,617
LAURA: Oh, okay, I'm gonna stealth too.

1014
00:38:42,617 --> 00:38:43,494
LIAM: Natural 20.

1015
00:38:43,494 --> 00:38:44,398
MARISHA: Woohoo!

1016
00:38:44,398 --> 00:38:50,396
LAURA: Natural 20. Oh, that really didn't count.

1017
00:38:50,396 --> 00:38:53,216
LIAM: Just roll on your phone a couple times and
then off to the side.

1018
00:38:53,216 --> 00:38:54,965
LAURA: They all sucked, so.

1019
00:38:55,019 --> 00:39:00,207
LIAM: And you said that the red crystals on the
wall are glowing somewhat?

1020
00:39:00,262 --> 00:39:04,164
MATT: Yeah, it's a certain amount of crystal that
this mountain range

1021
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:07,447
seems to naturally produce that just inherently.

1022
00:39:07,447 --> 00:39:12,364
LIAM: Enough to give the half-elves vision in low
light?

1023
00:39:12,364 --> 00:39:18,971
MATT: It seems such. At the point where you're
close to it. Currently you have to use his light

1024
00:39:18,971 --> 00:39:23,802
source to see much of anything. This village
doesn't have any, but near the walls and the edges

1025
00:39:23,802 --> 00:39:28,248
of the cavern you can see the gentle outline of
this whole size of it. It's immense.

1026
00:39:28,248 --> 00:39:30,500
TALIESIN: Does it seem that there are signs of
life?

1027
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,843
MATT: From this view, you don't see any movement.

1028
00:39:32,843 --> 00:39:36,197
LIAM: I am starting to creep along the ground
towards the nearest building and press up against

1029
00:39:36,197 --> 00:39:38,431
the wall and see if I can-- I'm just going to
listen.

1030
00:39:38,431 --> 00:39:42,436
LAURA: I rolled a 16, is that enough to actually
stealth?

1031
00:39:42,436 --> 00:39:43,365
MATT: That's up to you.

1032
00:39:43,365 --> 00:39:44,156
LAURA: No.

1033
00:39:44,156 --> 00:39:45,779
MARISHA: I'm going to let the twins stealth
ahead.

1034
00:39:45,944 --> 00:39:51,436
MATT: You guys stealth ahead. The two of you
follow each other, and you get to the outskirts,

1035
00:39:51,436 --> 00:39:57,129
and you can now see in the center of this, a
number of the buildings and huts have been smashed

1036
00:39:57,129 --> 00:40:03,822
or destroyed. You can see more and more of these
goblin corpses strewn across the ground. You can

1037
00:40:03,822 --> 00:40:08,880
see some of these tents seem to have rags or
something stuffed into one that's not too far

1038
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:16,498
ahead of you. There's two goblins near you,
apparently slashed open. Similar wounds. It's just

1039
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:19,666
from the first glance stepping forward.

1040
00:40:19,666 --> 00:40:22,328
LIAM: None of them alive, that we can tell?

1041
00:40:22,328 --> 00:40:23,247
MATT: Nope.

1042
00:40:23,247 --> 00:40:25,022
LAURA: We can't see any movement anywhere?

1043
00:40:25,077 --> 00:40:27,194
MATT: Not from this perspective. You guys moved
ahead and you barely have any light source of your

1044
00:40:27,194 --> 00:40:30,400
own. You're having to deal with just the outskirts
of his light spell.

1045
00:40:30,567 --> 00:40:32,312
LAURA: And none of that red light is lighting any
of this?

1046
00:40:32,312 --> 00:40:35,239
MATT: Not in the center of the village. Those are
only towards the outside walls of the cavern.

1047
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:36,371
LIAM: So we're in the dark.

1048
00:40:36,374 --> 00:40:39,828
LAURA: Can I go up and see if I can get one of
those little red rocks?

1049
00:40:39,828 --> 00:40:43,975
MATT: You can walk off to the side. So you take a
few minutes to walk off to the very edge of the

1050
00:40:43,975 --> 00:40:51,024
cavern. The rock is less of an actual stone that
you can pull, more than it's a cluster of-- almost

1051
00:40:51,143 --> 00:40:55,809
like a vein of the stone in the actual wall. It
would take a while for you to actually hack it out

1052
00:40:55,861 --> 00:40:59,578
of the side. It can be done, but it will take you
a while.

1053
00:40:59,578 --> 00:41:01,552
LAURA: Nah. I don't want to waste the time.

1054
00:41:01,552 --> 00:41:03,153
MATT: Okay.

1055
00:41:03,153 --> 00:41:04,369
LAURA: What do you think, should I do it?

1056
00:41:04,369 --> 00:41:04,936
LIAM: No.

1057
00:41:04,936 --> 00:41:05,702
LAURA: Okay, cool.

1058
00:41:05,702 --> 00:41:08,041
TRAVIS: (laughs) No.

1059
00:41:08,041 --> 00:41:11,464
LIAM: But we're in pitch black here, and we can't
really see what's going on. I think we need--

1060
00:41:11,464 --> 00:41:12,445
LAURA: A lantern.

1061
00:41:12,445 --> 00:41:13,379
LIAM: And Tiberius.

1062
00:41:13,379 --> 00:41:14,749
LAURA: (whispers) Tiberius.

1063
00:41:14,749 --> 00:41:17,294
LIAM: Wait, hold on. Tiberius, will you bring the
party up?

1064
00:41:17,294 --> 00:41:19,376
ORION: Oh yes, of course, we'll be right there.

1065
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:22,365
LAURA: Does anybody know-- have we told anybody at
home what that actually is?

1066
00:41:22,365 --> 00:41:24,982
MATT: Okay, so as you guys are aware, one of the
magical items that was designed by Tiberius early

1067
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:30,381
in the campaign are essentially these gem
enchanted earrings that activate as a Message

1068
00:41:30,381 --> 00:41:33,648
spell between a few party members. He made a few
of them.

1069
00:41:33,648 --> 00:41:36,418
LIAM: It was five total. Why don't we nail down
who that is. It's the twins.

1070
00:41:36,418 --> 00:41:37,961
LAURA: We both have one.

1071
00:41:38,012 --> 00:41:38,796
LIAM: You.

1072
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:40,323
ORION: You have one. He has one. She has one.

1073
00:41:40,323 --> 00:41:42,038
LIAM: He's pretty sneaky. All right.

1074
00:41:42,038 --> 00:41:44,319
SAM: And we can send and receive messages or just
receive?

1075
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:46,544
MATT: You're essentially whispering into each
other's ears.

1076
00:41:46,544 --> 00:41:47,398
ORION: They're like walkie-talkies.

1077
00:41:47,398 --> 00:41:48,486
LAURA: It's like a walkie-talkie.

1078
00:41:48,486 --> 00:41:49,921
MATT: But it only works within a certain range.

1079
00:41:49,921 --> 00:41:51,565
SAM: Is it like a Madonna microphone?

1080
00:41:51,565 --> 00:41:52,890
MATT: A straight up with a big ol'--

1081
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:54,188
ORION: I think it's like 500 feet.

1082
00:41:54,188 --> 00:42:02,422
MATT: 500 feet is the maximum length. So. You guys
approach slowly, the light source opens up, and

1083
00:42:02,422 --> 00:42:10,581
you see now a multitude of goblin bodies strewn
about the open area of this village. You can see

1084
00:42:10,581 --> 00:42:14,230
there are actually piles of corpses stuffed into
some of these huts in the sides that aren't

1085
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:19,159
goblin. You can see what looks like a few small
dwarven bodies piled up on the side. As you kinda

1086
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:22,258
glance over you look, some of them are partially
eaten like they have been stripped for meat.

1087
00:42:22,258 --> 00:42:23,011
LAURA: Ew.

1088
00:42:23,011 --> 00:42:24,211
TRAVIS: What?

1089
00:42:24,211 --> 00:42:30,637
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1090
00:42:30,637 --> 00:42:31,756
LAURA: 24.

1091
00:42:31,756 --> 00:42:32,671
LIAM: 22.

1092
00:42:32,671 --> 00:42:33,843
MATT: Okay.

1093
00:42:33,843 --> 00:42:35,674
LIAM: Check that building?

1094
00:42:35,674 --> 00:42:46,740
MATT: As you look through the building, there are
piles of bone, sinew, and metal at this point. The

1095
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:49,581
dwarven bodies are mostly decomposed entirely,
what remnants

1096
00:42:49,581 --> 00:42:51,997
have not been stripped off it for food.

1097
00:42:51,997 --> 00:42:55,456
LIAM: Anything useful in the pile?

1098
00:42:55,456 --> 00:43:04,148
MATT: As far as what you guys can tell, you
discover two things. One of the dwarves has a set

1099
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:05,860
of very very finely crafted leather armor.

1100
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,251
LAURA: Ooh.

1101
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:10,003
MATT: To pull it off the corpse is going to
destroy it and

1102
00:43:10,003 --> 00:43:12,539
going to be a not very interesting affair.

1103
00:43:12,539 --> 00:43:13,440
LAURA: Oh.

1104
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:18,655
MATT: But it does look to have survived the
horrible conditions under here. You also note

1105
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:25,120
specifically, Vex, that not the dwarven corpses,
but a number of the goblin corpses you come

1106
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:30,291
across, some of them have a uniform wound. A
number of these goblin corpses

1107
00:43:30,291 --> 00:43:35,441
have this terrible puncture wound in the skull.

1108
00:43:35,441 --> 00:43:36,435
LAURA: Oh no.

1109
00:43:36,435 --> 00:43:41,840
MATT: In the forehead there. Just an opening wound
about that big around.

1110
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:44,862
LAURA: You didn't notice that, that's how
unperceptive you are.

1111
00:43:44,862 --> 00:43:47,499
LIAM: My sister, everybody.

1112
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:51,556
MATT: And for each one of these wounds-- for as
much flesh is on these goblins,

1113
00:43:51,556 --> 00:43:54,417
there doesn't appear to be anything inside.

1114
00:43:54,417 --> 00:43:57,994
LAURA: It sucked their brains out. Whatever it
was.

1115
00:43:57,994 --> 00:43:59,461
MATT: It's very possible.

1116
00:43:59,461 --> 00:44:00,686
TRAVIS: I know what that feels like.

1117
00:44:00,686 --> 00:44:01,992
ORION: Ooh, brain suckers.

1118
00:44:01,992 --> 00:44:05,483
TRAVIS: Are we with you?

1119
00:44:05,483 --> 00:44:06,532
LAURA: No, you're not, you're still hanging out--

1120
00:44:06,532 --> 00:44:07,679
SAM: We've come back.

1121
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:09,102
TRAVIS: Did you put your finger in the hole?

1122
00:44:09,102 --> 00:44:11,639
LAURA: I'm going to put my finger in the hole.

1123
00:44:11,639 --> 00:44:13,578
ORION: I sauntered up 'cause--

1124
00:44:13,578 --> 00:44:14,262
SAM: You sauntered up.

1125
00:44:14,262 --> 00:44:15,252
ORION: You guys are sticking to the darkness?

1126
00:44:15,252 --> 00:44:17,562
MATT: Your finger goes inside, you reach around.
There are elements of brain matter within there

1127
00:44:17,562 --> 00:44:19,994
but even that has become very gelatinous.

1128
00:44:19,994 --> 00:44:21,048
TRAVIS: Oatmeal.

1129
00:44:21,048 --> 00:44:24,689
MATT: Partially decomposed in its own right,
almost like a slime. But sure enough, the inside

1130
00:44:24,689 --> 00:44:27,380
of the cranium itself is mostly vacant.

1131
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:30,052
LAURA: Lovely. Trinket, no, he's not with us.

1132
00:44:30,052 --> 00:44:31,610
MATT: Trinket is back with the party.

1133
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:33,882
MARISHA: So we can only assume that, what was his
name?

1134
00:44:33,882 --> 00:44:35,678
SAM: Should we rejoin our fellows?

1135
00:44:35,678 --> 00:44:36,298
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1136
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:38,956
LAURA: I guess it seems like it's safe enough,
right? Around here right now?

1137
00:44:38,956 --> 00:44:40,141
TRAVIS: We come running up.

1138
00:44:40,141 --> 00:44:43,099
ORION: We do.

1139
00:44:43,099 --> 00:44:45,010
SAM: Traipsing, we traipse up.

1140
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:45,980
TRAVIS: Skipping.

1141
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:48,413
LAURA: As silently as possible, you come running
up.

1142
00:44:48,413 --> 00:44:50,363
TRAVIS: (sings)

1143
00:44:50,363 --> 00:44:52,200
SAM: What's going on, guys?

1144
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,951
LAURA: Brain suckers, something that sucks
brains.

1145
00:44:54,951 --> 00:44:57,458
SAM: As long as they are sucking it out of
goblins, I'm good with that.

1146
00:44:57,458 --> 00:45:02,098
LIAM: My sister doesn't remember, but one of our
instructors in Syngorn used to tell us of a

1147
00:45:02,098 --> 00:45:04,322
creature, I'm not sure what they're called, but--

1148
00:45:04,322 --> 00:45:05,850
LAURA: I don't think I was in that class,
actually.

1149
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:12,457
LIAM: Mm. A creature that steals its victims'
minds and digests them,

1150
00:45:12,457 --> 00:45:15,746
reaches right in and takes them out.

1151
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:20,689
ORION: I'm assuming it's got to be a much smaller,
mutated version of our brain-on-legs friend.

1152
00:45:20,689 --> 00:45:22,406
LIAM: I think it's much worse.

1153
00:45:22,406 --> 00:45:23,272
MARISHA: Yeah. Much worse.

1154
00:45:23,272 --> 00:45:23,970
LAURA: Much worse?

1155
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:24,763
LIAM: Much worse.

1156
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:25,479
ORION: Yeah.

1157
00:45:25,479 --> 00:45:28,112
LIAM: I think the brain was a scout or some sort
of pet.

1158
00:45:28,112 --> 00:45:34,397
MARISHA: Well, we also have this K'varn, who is
experimenting on all those creatures,

1159
00:45:34,397 --> 00:45:36,366
so we can't even attest for any of this.

1160
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:37,147
LAURA: Exactly.

1161
00:45:37,147 --> 00:45:37,856
ORION: That's true.

1162
00:45:37,856 --> 00:45:39,300
TRAVIS: I take a few steps back.

1163
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,333
TALIESIN: It could just be parts of one.

1164
00:45:40,333 --> 00:45:44,527
MARISHA: Yeah, parts of one. It could be a
hodge-podge of everything

1165
00:45:44,527 --> 00:45:46,241
TALIESIN: A dragon, goblin drained, brained--

1166
00:45:46,241 --> 00:45:49,456
LAURA: (gasps) What if K'varn is a dragon? What
if-- oh wait, I don't know anything about that.

1167
00:45:49,456 --> 00:45:51,681
What was that symbol anyway, Tiberius?

1168
00:45:51,681 --> 00:45:53,999
ORION: That was a symbol of Bahamut, and it was a
protection thing

1169
00:45:53,999 --> 00:45:56,403
that I'm sure she put up to protect herself.

1170
00:45:56,403 --> 00:45:58,198
LAURA: Oh. So it was a good symbol?

1171
00:45:58,198 --> 00:45:58,982
ORION: It was, yes.

1172
00:45:58,982 --> 00:45:59,924
LAURA: Okay.

1173
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:03,194
MATT: You recall that Lady Kima was, specifically,
a paladin of Bahamut.

1174
00:46:03,194 --> 00:46:05,275
LAURA: Oh! So she probably did that.

1175
00:46:05,275 --> 00:46:06,532
MARISHA: So she's been here.

1176
00:46:06,532 --> 00:46:08,857
MATT: That camp seems to have been hers while she
was traipsing through the tunnels.

1177
00:46:08,857 --> 00:46:09,659
LAURA: I understand.

1178
00:46:09,659 --> 00:46:10,383
TALIESIN: Ah!

1179
00:46:10,383 --> 00:46:16,179
LIAM: I just think we should proceed with caution.
Our teachers spoke about this thing, said that it

1180
00:46:16,179 --> 00:46:24,389
was a being of the mind. I think our trouble with
Grog could just be the beginning. We need to

1181
00:46:24,389 --> 00:46:26,386
proceed very carefully.

1182
00:46:26,386 --> 00:46:27,339
LAURA: Oh no!

1183
00:46:27,339 --> 00:46:33,809
TRAVIS: I have two potions of fox's cunning. Could
I drink one of those, since there's a giant

1184
00:46:33,809 --> 00:46:35,713
brain-bitch wondering around the camp?

1185
00:46:35,713 --> 00:46:36,832
MARISHA: That's for your wisdom.

1186
00:46:36,832 --> 00:46:37,845
SAM: How long do they last?

1187
00:46:37,845 --> 00:46:38,992
LAURA: You could make yourself smarter?

1188
00:46:38,992 --> 00:46:40,017
TRAVIS: But it don't last very long.

1189
00:46:40,017 --> 00:46:42,313
MATT: Fox's cunning would give you benefit, I
believe, to--

1190
00:46:42,313 --> 00:46:44,634
MARISHA: Intelligence.

1191
00:46:44,634 --> 00:46:45,629
MATT: I mean, essentially--

1192
00:46:45,629 --> 00:46:47,139
MARISHA: It would be Enhance Ability, essentially.

1193
00:46:47,139 --> 00:46:49,541
MATT: It would be Enhance Ability for wisdom, I'm
pretty sure.

1194
00:46:49,541 --> 00:46:52,345
MARISHA: I'll tell you. I think it's wisdom.

1195
00:46:52,345 --> 00:46:53,313
TRAVIS: Not intelligence?

1196
00:46:53,313 --> 00:46:54,495
MARISHA: No, no, no, it's intelligence.

1197
00:46:54,495 --> 00:46:55,553
MATT: It's intelligence? Okay, there you go.

1198
00:46:55,553 --> 00:46:57,489
MARISHA: Because I think it's like owl's wisdom
for wisdom.

1199
00:46:57,489 --> 00:46:58,713
MATT: Right, no, you're correct. So essentially it
would be an

1200
00:46:58,713 --> 00:47:00,521
Enhance Ability for intelligence, yes.

1201
00:47:00,521 --> 00:47:01,901
LAURA: How long does it last?

1202
00:47:01,901 --> 00:47:06,958
MATT: Oh, for the potion's effect? That would be
anywhere from four to eight hours,

1203
00:47:06,958 --> 00:47:07,972
you're not quite sure.

1204
00:47:07,972 --> 00:47:09,766
LAURA: Maybe you should wait until we come across
something.

1205
00:47:09,766 --> 00:47:10,931
TRAVIS: All right, but if it's too late--

1206
00:47:10,931 --> 00:47:13,464
MARISHA: Yeah, you have advantage on intelligence
checks.

1207
00:47:13,464 --> 00:47:15,316
TRAVIS: Intelligence checks? All right.

1208
00:47:15,316 --> 00:47:16,519
LIAM: Just don't go running off into the dark
again.

1209
00:47:16,519 --> 00:47:19,480
LAURA: Yeah, let us lead the way, or whoever's
smart. I'm really smart, how smart are you?

1210
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,964
LIAM: Not smart enough, apparently.

1211
00:47:20,964 --> 00:47:22,417
MARISHA: So it wouldn't necessarily--

1212
00:47:22,417 --> 00:47:23,441
TRAVIS: It wouldn't make my intelligence higher?

1213
00:47:23,441 --> 00:47:24,710
MARISHA: It wouldn't make your intelligence
higher,

1214
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:25,701
and it wouldn't necessarily help with your 
vulnerability.

1215
00:47:25,701 --> 00:47:26,842
TRAVIS: All right, never mind.

1216
00:47:26,842 --> 00:47:27,645
LIAM: He's smart.

1217
00:47:27,645 --> 00:47:29,553
LAURA: Who's our smartest person? Who has the
highest intelligence here?

1218
00:47:29,553 --> 00:47:32,485
LIAM: What are these scores you keep talking
about? I don't know what anybody's talking about.

1219
00:47:32,485 --> 00:47:35,913
ORION: It's okay, Vax. I don't know what a lot of
people are talking about all of the time.

1220
00:47:35,913 --> 00:47:36,885
TALIESIN: IRL?

1221
00:47:36,885 --> 00:47:38,437
TRAVIS: Yeah, whoever's the smartest should be in
the front.

1222
00:47:38,437 --> 00:47:39,296
LAURA: That's true.

1223
00:47:39,296 --> 00:47:40,374
TALIESIN: I'm sitting at 16.

1224
00:47:40,374 --> 00:47:41,414
TRAVIS: 14.

1225
00:47:41,414 --> 00:47:42,180
LIAM: 16.

1226
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:43,028
LAURA: 16.

1227
00:47:43,028 --> 00:47:45,190
MARISHA: Well it's about, like, having high-- it's
not necessarily being smart,

1228
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:47,773
it's about having resistance to willpower.

1229
00:47:47,773 --> 00:47:50,207
LAURA: But if they take you down-- if they take
down your intelligence,

1230
00:47:50,207 --> 00:47:53,146
then whoever has higher intelligence--

1231
00:47:53,146 --> 00:47:54,114
MARISHA: Right.

1232
00:47:54,114 --> 00:47:55,958
SAM: No one's going to take down our intelligence,
we're too strong and we're too awesome.

1233
00:47:55,958 --> 00:47:57,749
LAURA: I don't want another catatonic-- all
right.

1234
00:47:57,749 --> 00:47:59,127
ORION: And we know what we're going into.

1235
00:47:59,127 --> 00:48:00,080
LAURA: All right!

1236
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,209
MARISHA: Well, we sort of know what we're going
into.

1237
00:48:01,209 --> 00:48:02,656
TRAVIS: Does that mean we get to run into a
fight?

1238
00:48:02,656 --> 00:48:04,125
LAURA: Oh no, this music sounds very fighty.

1239
00:48:04,125 --> 00:48:05,054
MARISHA: Hang on.

1240
00:48:05,054 --> 00:48:06,369
SAM: Or festive.

1241
00:48:06,369 --> 00:48:07,475
LAURA: Oh no!

1242
00:48:07,475 --> 00:48:09,213
MARISHA: Okay, so here's my question.

1243
00:48:09,213 --> 00:48:09,945
LIAM: Yeah.

1244
00:48:09,945 --> 00:48:11,875
MARISHA: So we've already fought two things where
we can't look at them

1245
00:48:11,875 --> 00:48:14,991
and they mess with our heads.

1246
00:48:14,991 --> 00:48:15,648
TRAVIS: Right.

1247
00:48:15,648 --> 00:48:16,381
LAURA: Yes.

1248
00:48:16,381 --> 00:48:18,552
MARISHA: So is there something we can do going
forward--

1249
00:48:18,552 --> 00:48:21,481
LAURA: To like boost our willpower or something?

1250
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:22,513
MARISHA: Or like--

1251
00:48:22,513 --> 00:48:27,890
TALIESIN: You want Magneto's helmet? What you want
is Magneto's helmet.

1252
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:29,617
MARISHA: I like Magneto's helmet! Or even if we--

1253
00:48:29,617 --> 00:48:31,115
TALIESIN: I haven't built Magneto's helmet.

1254
00:48:31,115 --> 00:48:34,323
MARISHA: Do we have a bunch of mirrors? Or where
we can look through things with reflections.

1255
00:48:34,323 --> 00:48:36,169
LAURA: (gasps) I gave you some mirrors! Do you
remember?

1256
00:48:36,169 --> 00:48:37,239
LIAM: I have mirrors.

1257
00:48:37,239 --> 00:48:38,213
TRAVIS: We do have a big dressing mirror.

1258
00:48:38,213 --> 00:48:39,313
LIAM: But that's more for--

1259
00:48:39,313 --> 00:48:41,486
LAURA: For looking around corners?

1260
00:48:41,486 --> 00:48:42,439
LIAM: I don't know if that's going to help.

1261
00:48:42,439 --> 00:48:43,296
LAURA: It could help!

1262
00:48:43,296 --> 00:48:44,280
ORION: I could make a mirror.

1263
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,663
LIAM: Yes, I have them, of course. I always, I
always have them, they were a gift.

1264
00:48:45,663 --> 00:48:47,283
TRAVIS: We have one mirror in the bag of holding.

1265
00:48:47,283 --> 00:48:48,206
LAURA: That's good!

1266
00:48:48,206 --> 00:48:49,321
ORION: With like an ice-type of thing--

1267
00:48:49,321 --> 00:48:50,255
LAURA: We could put a mirror--

1268
00:48:50,255 --> 00:48:52,075
MARISHA: Kind of like a Medusa's gaze thing. You
know, where you like look in the reflection.

1269
00:48:52,075 --> 00:48:54,882
LIAM: But that's a Gorgon. That's talking about
the gaze--

1270
00:48:54,882 --> 00:48:55,745
MARISHA: Right.

1271
00:48:55,745 --> 00:48:57,191
LIAM: We're talking about the mind, I think.

1272
00:48:57,191 --> 00:48:57,911
LAURA: Right.

1273
00:48:57,911 --> 00:48:58,909
MARISHA: Yeah.

1274
00:48:58,909 --> 00:49:02,255
SAM: I have a whip! And a forgery kit.

1275
00:49:02,255 --> 00:49:04,045
(all laugh)

1276
00:49:04,045 --> 00:49:06,987
MARISHA: It would just be about making us less
vulnerable to the mind--

1277
00:49:06,987 --> 00:49:09,211
LIAM: Could you forge some professor hats for us
all?

1278
00:49:09,211 --> 00:49:11,138
(all laugh)

1279
00:49:11,138 --> 00:49:13,158
LAURA: So what, our option is to keep moving
forward, then?

1280
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:15,366
SAM: Yes, just be cautious, that's all we can do.

1281
00:49:15,366 --> 00:49:16,629
VAX and TALIESIN: That's all we can do.

1282
00:49:16,629 --> 00:49:17,406
LAURA: All right.

1283
00:49:17,406 --> 00:49:18,303
TRAVIS: We move forward.

1284
00:49:18,303 --> 00:49:19,243
SAM: What do you want to do, you want go back?

1285
00:49:19,243 --> 00:49:20,610
LAURA: As quietly as possible, to keep moving
forward.

1286
00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:21,940
TALIESIN: It's difficult to prepare for what we're
not prepared for.

1287
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:23,940
LAURA: And on the lookout for anything in this
ramshackle town.

1288
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:25,320
MARISHA: That's true.

1289
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:26,133
TALIESIN: Sorry.

1290
00:49:26,133 --> 00:49:28,651
MARISHA: I mean, I can cast Enhance Ability to
help our willpower? Or our will.

1291
00:49:28,651 --> 00:49:30,290
MATT: So you leave behind the pile of dwarven
corpses, you leave behind the goblin corpses with

1292
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:33,145
the wounds and start seeing more of a pattern.

1293
00:49:33,145 --> 00:49:40,262
LIAM: And if I may, I suggest Tiberius, you work
your Light spell, and Vex'ahlia and I scout ahead

1294
00:49:40,262 --> 00:49:45,159
about 60 or 70 feet, so that we can see in the dim
light, catch anything coming, using your magic.

1295
00:49:45,159 --> 00:49:46,471
LAURA: Yes.

1296
00:49:46,471 --> 00:49:50,004
TRAVIS: And I light up the hooded lantern we have
in the bag of holding.

1297
00:49:50,004 --> 00:49:54,051
MATT: Okay. So you put the hood on and light that
up, very good. Leaving the leather armor behind?

1298
00:49:54,051 --> 00:49:56,912
LAURA: Oh well, I thought you said it would get
ruined if we took it?

1299
00:49:56,912 --> 00:49:58,184
LIAM: And it was dwarf-sized.

1300
00:49:58,184 --> 00:49:59,743
MATT: No, it would be nasty pulling it off a
corpse.

1301
00:49:59,743 --> 00:50:00,922
LAURA: Oh, well then, fuck it, let's pull it off.

1302
00:50:00,977 --> 00:50:02,979
LIAM: Isn't it dwarf-sized? Or is armor also
shrink and expand?

1303
00:50:02,979 --> 00:50:04,314
LAURA: It's magical. Possibly.

1304
00:50:04,314 --> 00:50:05,350
MATT: It's dwarf-sized.

1305
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:06,145
LIAM: Magical.

1306
00:50:06,145 --> 00:50:08,044
ORION: It's fine. I cast Prestidigitation and
clean it all up.

1307
00:50:08,044 --> 00:50:08,956
LAURA: I take it.

1308
00:50:08,956 --> 00:50:10,196
MATT: Okay, so you shake off the element--

1309
00:50:10,196 --> 00:50:11,320
LAURA: All the goo.

1310
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:15,093
MATT: -- the remaining elements of the dwarven
corpse. Just falls off out of the armor. You have

1311
00:50:15,093 --> 00:50:16,926
to kind of shake it and eventually all of it
escapes--

1312
00:50:16,926 --> 00:50:18,572
LAURA: Yes. Thank you!

1313
00:50:18,572 --> 00:50:19,575
TALIESIN: Dwarven corpse.

1314
00:50:19,575 --> 00:50:21,180
LIAM: It's like pulled pork.

1315
00:50:21,298 --> 00:50:22,565
LAURA: Mm.

1316
00:50:22,565 --> 00:50:24,174
MATT: Make an arcana check. It does have a magical
aura.

1317
00:50:24,174 --> 00:50:25,803
LAURA: (gasps) What is it?

1318
00:50:25,803 --> 00:50:27,407
ORION: Nice. 20.

1319
00:50:27,407 --> 00:50:33,431
MATT: All right. It appears to be a simple but
powerful enchantment. It is a pair of studded

1320
00:50:33,431 --> 00:50:35,833
leather armor with a +2 enchantment.

1321
00:50:35,833 --> 00:50:36,868
LAURA: +2 enchantment to what?

1322
00:50:36,868 --> 00:50:37,941
SAM: +2 enchantment?

1323
00:50:37,941 --> 00:50:39,182
MATT: To your AC.

1324
00:50:39,182 --> 00:50:41,932
LIAM: If I try to pull on the sleeve, does it come
up to my elbow or does it stretch out and fit?

1325
00:50:41,932 --> 00:50:45,104
MATT: It comes up to your elbow and then, given a
moment, it fits to your form.

1326
00:50:45,104 --> 00:50:46,207
LAURA: Ooh, yeah!

1327
00:50:46,207 --> 00:50:47,400
LIAM: That's nice.

1328
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,126
LAURA: Go take that studded leather armor,
brother!

1329
00:50:49,126 --> 00:50:54,416
LIAM: I'll take this, hold on. Thank you. I go
into the smelly corpse hut

1330
00:50:54,416 --> 00:50:56,306
and start to change my armor.

1331
00:50:56,306 --> 00:50:57,376
LAURA: What did you get? Let me see that.

1332
00:50:57,376 --> 00:50:58,727
SAM: So wait, does he get a bigger or higher AC?
What is that?

1333
00:50:58,727 --> 00:51:01,133
MATT: Yes, it is considered-- it works as studded
leather armor, but that gives him a +2 bonus to

1334
00:51:01,133 --> 00:51:02,662
his armor class on top of that.

1335
00:51:02,662 --> 00:51:04,651
SAM: Wow, that's huge!

1336
00:51:04,651 --> 00:51:06,252
LAURA: Yeah, so he just took it.

1337
00:51:06,252 --> 00:51:07,095
SAM: I'll take it.

1338
00:51:07,095 --> 00:51:08,018
LAURA: He already took it.

1339
00:51:08,018 --> 00:51:09,483
MARISHA: Hey, dungeon master? Asking as the
dungeon master.

1340
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:10,379
MATT: Yes?

1341
00:51:10,379 --> 00:51:13,652
MARISHA: If I cast Owl's Wisdom on people, it
gives people advantage on wisdom checks. Would

1342
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:15,772
that count on saving throws against willpower?

1343
00:51:15,772 --> 00:51:16,584
MATT: No.

1344
00:51:16,584 --> 00:51:19,151
LAURA: Damn it!

1345
00:51:19,151 --> 00:51:20,924
MATT: Not checks, specifically.

1346
00:51:21,038 --> 00:51:22,285
MARISHA: Would it help anything?

1347
00:51:22,285 --> 00:51:23,080
MATT: I mean--

1348
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,472
MARISHA: Would, would any advantage to wisdom
under Enhance Ability help some?

1349
00:51:25,472 --> 00:51:26,624
MATT: Let me double-check it.

1350
00:51:26,624 --> 00:51:27,843
SAM: I'll give you all dice before we go in.

1351
00:51:27,843 --> 00:51:32,233
LAURA: Some of these-- I remember we rolled
charisma saving throws, though, for the umbers.

1352
00:51:32,233 --> 00:51:34,348
They were charisma.

1353
00:51:34,348 --> 00:51:37,372
MARISHA: Right. And for the brains it was versus
willpower.

1354
00:51:37,372 --> 00:51:41,234
SAM: While the DM looks this up, everyone,
subscribe to the Geek and Sundry twitch channel!

1355
00:51:41,234 --> 00:51:45,107
Support the show, support the channel.

1356
00:51:45,107 --> 00:51:48,529
MARISHA: Yeah! And don't forget about our charity,
826LA, which

1357
00:51:48,529 --> 00:51:52,036
helps children be literate and write stories well.

1358
00:51:52,036 --> 00:51:54,311
ORION: It makes them smarter in the head.

1359
00:51:54,311 --> 00:51:56,103
SAM: And keep sending us food.

1360
00:51:56,103 --> 00:51:57,616
(all laugh)

1361
00:51:57,616 --> 00:51:58,415
TRAVIS: We like food.

1362
00:51:58,415 --> 00:51:59,484
SAM: And more presents.

1363
00:51:59,484 --> 00:52:01,182
LIAM: If you want a thousand years--

1364
00:52:01,182 --> 00:52:03,698
ZAC: There's more food on the way, so don't ask
them for more.

1365
00:52:03,698 --> 00:52:04,304
MARISHA: What?

1366
00:52:04,304 --> 00:52:05,017
ORION: Oh, no!

1367
00:52:05,017 --> 00:52:05,798
TRAVIS: No food!

1368
00:52:05,798 --> 00:52:06,807
TALIESIN and SAM: No more food.

1369
00:52:06,807 --> 00:52:08,511
MATT: Yeah, we have enough food, guys,
thank you.

1370
00:52:08,511 --> 00:52:12,790
LIAM: If you want a thousand years of D&amp;D, we've
got to pay the overheads, so please, subscribe!

1371
00:52:12,854 --> 00:52:14,187
ORION: It's true!

1372
00:52:14,187 --> 00:52:18,030
MATT: So yeah, unfortunately it helps ability
checks, those are not considered saving throws.

1373
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:20,316
LAURA: All right.

1374
00:52:20,316 --> 00:52:21,480
MARISHA: I don't know if I have anything.

1375
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:22,558
TALIESIN: We'll be all right, we'll be all right.

1376
00:52:22,558 --> 00:52:23,748
ORION: As we start to walk, I cast Stoneskin on
myself.

1377
00:52:23,748 --> 00:52:25,737
MATT: You cast Stoneskin on yourself? All right,
Stoneskin's on you, Tiberius.

1378
00:52:25,737 --> 00:52:26,910
LIAM: Once you've got the dwarf gunk off, it's
rather nice.

1379
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:27,694
LAURA: Oh yeah?

1380
00:52:27,694 --> 00:52:28,689
LIAM: Yes, it's supple.

1381
00:52:28,689 --> 00:52:31,678
SAM: All right, shall we keep on keeping on?

1382
00:52:31,678 --> 00:52:32,309
TALIESIN: Let's go.

1383
00:52:32,309 --> 00:52:33,972
LAURA: Let's go, let's keep on moving!

1384
00:52:33,972 --> 00:52:34,902
MARISHA: Let's get it done.

1385
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:36,241
ORION: (sings) Keep on keeping on.

1386
00:52:36,241 --> 00:52:37,651
MATT: You guys keep pushing forward.

1387
00:52:37,651 --> 00:52:39,454
ORION: Is that what we're going to do?

1388
00:52:39,454 --> 00:52:40,856
LAURA: All right.

1389
00:52:40,856 --> 00:52:43,222
MATT: All right, as you begin to press through the
goblin ghost town--

1390
00:52:43,222 --> 00:52:45,005
TRAVIS: We've got to get it closer than that.

1391
00:52:45,005 --> 00:52:48,175
LAURA: I'm still tracking, looking for anything
interesting.

1392
00:52:48,175 --> 00:52:53,463
MATT: Which you do, you catch, off in the
distance, another faint moving light source.

1393
00:52:53,463 --> 00:52:55,603
LAURA: Oh shit! Hey, everybody, calm down.

1394
00:52:55,603 --> 00:52:56,535
SAM: Huh?

1395
00:52:56,535 --> 00:52:59,171
LAURA: Sh! There's something moving in the
distance.

1396
00:52:59,171 --> 00:53:01,228
MATT: Everyone roll a stealth check.

1397
00:53:01,228 --> 00:53:02,561
TRAVIS: Stealth check?

1398
00:53:02,561 --> 00:53:04,442
MATT: Yes.

1399
00:53:04,442 --> 00:53:08,990
LAURA: Oh god, roll a stealth check. (gasps)
Natural 20!

1400
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:10,477
MATT and LIAM: Nice!

1401
00:53:10,477 --> 00:53:11,742
LIAM: 30.

1402
00:53:11,742 --> 00:53:13,181
MARISHA: 15.

1403
00:53:13,181 --> 00:53:14,104
ORION: 11.

1404
00:53:14,104 --> 00:53:15,124
SAM: 20.

1405
00:53:15,124 --> 00:53:16,535
TALIESIN: 12.

1406
00:53:16,535 --> 00:53:17,720
TRAVIS: (softly) Six.

1407
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:20,439
MATT: Okay, as you all buckle down and be as quiet
as you can--

1408
00:53:20,439 --> 00:53:22,285
LAURA: You rolled a six? He rolled a six.

1409
00:53:22,285 --> 00:53:23,305
MATT: You begin to see--

1410
00:53:23,305 --> 00:53:25,090
SAM: (whispers) Grog rolled a six.

1411
00:53:25,090 --> 00:53:26,332
LIAM: (whispers) Stay put, you asshole.

1412
00:53:26,332 --> 00:53:29,660
MATT: No, noted, that's okay, that's okay. It's a
group check,

1413
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:32,035
in which case people offset each other's 
difficulty.

1414
00:53:32,035 --> 00:53:33,320
TRAVIS: Yay, bell curve.

1415
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:39,334
MATT: So you seem to be comfortable in the
stillness of the moment. Best you can see in the

1416
00:53:39,334 --> 00:53:42,532
distance, you see figures shifting, moving away
from you.

1417
00:53:42,532 --> 00:53:44,069
LAURA: (whispers) Sh, figures!

1418
00:53:44,069 --> 00:53:50,577
MATT: Many figures. A fairly large group of
seeming to be humanoid figures, moving steadily

1419
00:53:50,577 --> 00:53:53,512
away from you.

1420
00:53:53,512 --> 00:53:55,215
LAURA: Can we scout ahead? We're both really super
stealth, can we like--

1421
00:53:55,215 --> 00:53:56,996
LIAM: Yeah, we're gonna start kinda quickly dash
after them.

1422
00:53:56,996 --> 00:53:58,949
MATT: Yeah, using your same stealth rolls, you
push forward.

1423
00:53:58,949 --> 00:54:00,377
TRAVIS: Humanoid figures, you say?

1424
00:54:00,377 --> 00:54:01,396
LIAM: Could mean anything.

1425
00:54:01,396 --> 00:54:05,106
MATT: Yes, best you could tell. As you guys start
reaching the outskirts of the opposite side of

1426
00:54:05,106 --> 00:54:12,554
this small, goblin village that has been
completely sundered, you see a cliff, but a large

1427
00:54:12,554 --> 00:54:18,524
cliff. The actual surface here comes to a very
direct end and seems to just disappear into a dark

1428
00:54:18,524 --> 00:54:25,060
abyss. There is a singular, ten-foot-wide rope
bridge, that is bolted into the side of this cliff

1429
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:31,127
and stretches out across this giant crevasse, for
what-- you can't see the other side.

1430
00:54:31,127 --> 00:54:32,230
TRAVIS: Awesome!

1431
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:34,030
LAURA: This feels like The Descent, I don't like
this, you guys.

1432
00:54:34,097 --> 00:54:37,384
MATT: It very much has that kind of a feel. It
just goes on a for a good 60, 70 feet, and then

1433
00:54:37,384 --> 00:54:43,230
darkness. And you can see what looks to be a
cluster of about 12 to 13 duergar--

1434
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:44,186
LAURA: (whispers) Oh no.

1435
00:54:44,186 --> 00:54:49,174
MATT: -- making their way in lines of two across
this bridge. Amongst them, they have, chained up,

1436
00:54:49,174 --> 00:54:53,685
three dwarf miners that they are also dragging
across the bridge.

1437
00:54:53,685 --> 00:54:54,914
SAM: We have to save those ones.

1438
00:54:54,914 --> 00:54:55,974
TRAVIS: Just cut the bridge

1439
00:54:55,974 --> 00:54:57,104
SAM: No, no!

1440
00:54:57,104 --> 00:55:01,077
LAURA: What do the miners look like? Are they--
are they docile, or are they--

1441
00:55:01,077 --> 00:55:02,751
do they seem to be fighting back?

1442
00:55:02,751 --> 00:55:05,757
MATT: They don't appear to put up much of a fight
in their current circumstance.

1443
00:55:05,757 --> 00:55:06,798
LIAM: How wide is the bridge?

1444
00:55:06,798 --> 00:55:07,493
MATT: Ten feet.

1445
00:55:07,493 --> 00:55:11,385
LIAM: Ten feet? That means two people wide.

1446
00:55:11,385 --> 00:55:13,531
LAURA: Grog goes by himself. Yes.

1447
00:55:13,531 --> 00:55:15,992
LIAM: But if we go out there, it's going to be
close combat.

1448
00:55:15,992 --> 00:55:17,337
TRAVIS: (whispers) We have a flying carpet.

1449
00:55:17,337 --> 00:55:18,830
LIAM: You can't get to the ones at the back.

1450
00:55:18,830 --> 00:55:20,486
LAURA: I mean how many are there? Like ten or so?

1451
00:55:20,486 --> 00:55:22,080
LIAM: 12. 12 I count.

1452
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:24,742
MATT: From what you can see it looks about 12-ish

1453
00:55:24,742 --> 00:55:26,876
LAURA: And they have a light source with them so
we can definitely see them?

1454
00:55:26,876 --> 00:55:31,347
MATT: They do, it's a very faint light. It's like
a small cluster of the red stone that's been mined

1455
00:55:31,347 --> 00:55:35,254
and put into a spherical element and is hanging
from a chain like a lantern.

1456
00:55:35,254 --> 00:55:37,673
LAURA: We have two options. We can fight them.

1457
00:55:37,673 --> 00:55:39,151
LIAM: We could fight now.

1458
00:55:39,151 --> 00:55:40,103
LAURA: Or follow them.

1459
00:55:40,103 --> 00:55:41,229
TRAVIS: Follow.

1460
00:55:41,229 --> 00:55:42,470
LAURA: I think we follow them.

1461
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:46,494
MARISHA: Do I see any-- are there any bats?

1462
00:55:46,561 --> 00:55:49,986
MATT: Make a perception check.

1463
00:55:49,986 --> 00:55:52,092
SAM: If we follow them on the bridge, won't they
feel it bouncing?

1464
00:55:52,149 --> 00:55:53,200
MARISHA: I failed.

1465
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,559
LAURA: We gotta wait 'til they cross it, Scanlan.

1466
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:55,846
SAM: We can't see the end of it.

1467
00:55:55,846 --> 00:55:59,124
LIAM: I grab my ear and, Keyleth, I heard you
through Tiberius' earring,

1468
00:55:59,124 --> 00:56:01,818
why don't you just become a bat and follow along?

1469
00:56:01,818 --> 00:56:02,875
LAURA: She's trying to do that.

1470
00:56:02,875 --> 00:56:04,726
MARISHA: I was gonna see if they're in the--

1471
00:56:04,726 --> 00:56:06,681
LIAM: You've never seen a bat in the woods?

1472
00:56:06,681 --> 00:56:10,399
MATT: Best you can tell, and from your knowledge
of bats and their existence, they generally live

1473
00:56:10,469 --> 00:56:14,806
in caverns that have readily available openings to
the outside world, where they do their nocturnal

1474
00:56:14,806 --> 00:56:21,622
hunting. This is a very, very deep cavern that
does not have easy access to the surface. Bats are

1475
00:56:21,683 --> 00:56:23,724
probably not a good chance in this cavern.

1476
00:56:23,724 --> 00:56:31,398
LAURA: I've got an idea. I run back to Grog,
stealthed. I get our flying carpet.

1477
00:56:31,398 --> 00:56:33,622
MATT: A hand suddenly mysteriously reaches into
the bag.

1478
00:56:33,622 --> 00:56:34,549
TRAVIS: (sputters)

1479
00:56:34,549 --> 00:56:37,830
LAURA: Gimme the carpet.

1480
00:56:37,830 --> 00:56:38,434
TRAVIS: What?

1481
00:56:38,434 --> 00:56:39,380
LAURA: The carpet. Gimme the carpet.

1482
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:40,740
SAM: Just you? You're gonna go on the carpet
alone?

1483
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:42,565
LAURA: And him. we can both go on the carpet.

1484
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:43,995
SAM: What if something happens?

1485
00:56:43,995 --> 00:56:45,924
LAURA: We just gotta see where they're going!
We'll come back and get you.

1486
00:56:45,924 --> 00:56:47,507
SAM: I'm coming with you.

1487
00:56:47,507 --> 00:56:48,265
LAURA: All right, Scanlan.

1488
00:56:48,265 --> 00:56:53,144
TRAVIS: I give them her carpet, but I also tie the
endless rope thread around.

1489
00:56:53,144 --> 00:56:55,849
LAURA: Oh yeah. Okay, so we have an endless rope
with us.

1490
00:56:55,849 --> 00:56:57,047
LIAM: Now we're a kite.

1491
00:56:57,047 --> 00:57:00,747
MATT: You pull out the carpet and lay it out. At
this point in time,

1492
00:57:00,747 --> 00:57:02,659
they're a little over halfway across the bridge.

1493
00:57:02,659 --> 00:57:03,539
LAURA: Okay, so we--

1494
00:57:03,539 --> 00:57:06,630
MATT: Which, you can see it swaying in a very
uncomfortable way.

1495
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:08,318
LAURA: Scanlan, you better be stealthed.

1496
00:57:08,318 --> 00:57:09,638
MATT: You hear the stretching of ropes.

1497
00:57:09,638 --> 00:57:13,144
LAURA: Oh, you can hear the rope?

1498
00:57:13,144 --> 00:57:18,049
MATT: As you hear the rope just tense as the
bridge is slowly swaying. So you guys lay out the

1499
00:57:18,049 --> 00:57:19,613
carpet. The two of you get on?

1500
00:57:19,613 --> 00:57:21,048
LAURA and LIAM: And Scanlan.

1501
00:57:21,048 --> 00:57:22,713
LIAM: I grab Scanlan by the scruff of his neck.

1502
00:57:22,713 --> 00:57:24,710
MATT: The three of you guys hop on, and it's
probably big enough for the three of you.

1503
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:26,275
It's about the right size.

1504
00:57:26,275 --> 00:57:28,070
SAM: Shotgun.

1505
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:33,860
MATT: The carpet begins to lift off, and you kind
of will it towards-- Are you going straight over

1506
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:35,291
the bridge or are you taking a side route?

1507
00:57:35,291 --> 00:57:36,712
LAURA: We're going next to the bridge.

1508
00:57:36,712 --> 00:57:38,338
LIAM: Side and up. 'Cause they can look sideways.

1509
00:57:38,338 --> 00:57:39,659
LAURA: I think we should go down below the
bridge.

1510
00:57:39,659 --> 00:57:42,276
LIAM: If you're on a bridge, you're looking down
at your feet.

1511
00:57:42,276 --> 00:57:43,587
SAM: Let's go above them.

1512
00:57:43,666 --> 00:57:45,668
LAURA: All right, fine, fuck it, go above them.

1513
00:57:45,668 --> 00:57:50,512
MATT: Okay so you guys, you take up over. First
off, the three of you guys make a stealth check.

1514
00:57:50,512 --> 00:57:52,052
LAURA: I thought we were still stealthed?

1515
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:56,007
MATT: Maneuvering on a flying carpet is a
different type of locomotion.

1516
00:57:56,007 --> 00:57:58,894
TALIESIN: We have a flying carpet, by the way.
That's a thing.

1517
00:57:58,894 --> 00:58:00,711
SAM: Not great. 13.

1518
00:58:00,711 --> 00:58:01,513
LIAM: 29.

1519
00:58:01,513 --> 00:58:02,520
LAURA: 17.

1520
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,212
MATT: Okay.

1521
00:58:03,212 --> 00:58:05,269
MARISHA: Were you guys trying to stealth? Is that
what happened?

1522
00:58:05,269 --> 00:58:15,718
MATT: So, as soon as you reach the edge of the
crevasse, immediately the air itself is warmer. And

1523
00:58:15,718 --> 00:58:21,833
there's actually a bit of a strange breeze blowing up
from underneath this giant crevasse. And you look

1524
00:58:22,005 --> 00:58:27,691
down and you can see, faintly, light sources.
Long, thin, trickling

1525
00:58:27,691 --> 00:58:31,381
streams of what looks like molten rock.

1526
00:58:31,381 --> 00:58:32,204
TRAVIS: Shit.

1527
00:58:32,204 --> 00:58:33,258
SAM: Way down below.

1528
00:58:33,258 --> 00:58:34,160
MATT: Way down below.

1529
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,072
TRAVIS: That's a ways.

1530
00:58:35,072 --> 00:58:38,331
MATT: It's at least a thousand feet down.

1531
00:58:38,331 --> 00:58:40,741
SAM: We don't want to fall.

1532
00:58:40,741 --> 00:58:45,185
MATT: Don't fall, it's very bad. The air itself
has a very sulfurous smell. There's a lot of

1533
00:58:45,185 --> 00:58:51,537
various strange chemical scents that's a bit
pungent to the nose. There's a lot of chemical

1534
00:58:51,537 --> 00:58:57,137
reactions that are causing this atmosphere. It's a
little difficult to take any air at first. You

1535
00:58:57,137 --> 00:59:01,951
have to get adjusted. It is a very, very deep
cavern below. When you look behind, you can see

1536
00:59:01,951 --> 00:59:07,222
the river that's been cascading through this
cavern goes rocketing off the edge and disappears

1537
00:59:07,222 --> 00:59:13,192
into the darkness below. Are you keeping your
distance or--

1538
00:59:13,192 --> 00:59:14,434
LAURA: Keeping a good distance.

1539
00:59:14,434 --> 00:59:16,857
LIAM: Distance, because they have a light source,
so we want to follow that.

1540
00:59:16,857 --> 00:59:18,994
LAURA: Yeah, so we need to stay kind of out of it
but see it.

1541
00:59:18,994 --> 00:59:27,262
MATT: Okay. You guys push forward, keeping at a
safe distance. You eventually follow them across

1542
00:59:27,262 --> 00:59:34,825
the crevasse, and you can see now them entering
what looks like a shanty town of tents and small

1543
00:59:34,825 --> 00:59:42,636
stone structures. Better built than the goblin
village that was previously there, but it looks

1544
00:59:42,636 --> 00:59:50,659
almost like a temporary or pseudo-temporary series
of homes for the duergar in this section. There's

1545
00:59:50,659 --> 00:59:55,738
a bunch of military tents and cloth pup tents put
up in sections. You can see some easy-to-construct

1546
00:59:55,738 --> 01:00:01,792
one- or two-day constructions of stone buildings.
Very square, very rigid and dwarven in their

1547
01:00:01,792 --> 01:00:09,512
design, more for utility that any sort of visual
presentation or beauty.

1548
01:00:09,512 --> 01:00:11,796
LIAM: This is a temporary war camp.

1549
01:00:11,796 --> 01:00:13,193
LAURA: It is.

1550
01:00:13,193 --> 01:00:15,014
MATT: There are also a series of these-

1551
01:00:15,014 --> 01:00:16,114
LIAM: Yes!

1552
01:00:16,114 --> 01:00:17,097
MATT: -- of these redstone--

1553
01:00:17,097 --> 01:00:18,437
LAURA: Good dialogue!

1554
01:00:18,437 --> 01:00:23,983
MATT: Yeah, it's legit guys. A series of these
redstone torches that they were holding, or these

1555
01:00:23,983 --> 01:00:29,188
lanterns, are hung up all throughout the village
on these giant poles that have been placed in

1556
01:00:29,188 --> 01:00:33,958
areas to give a little bit of an occasional light
source throughout this entire camp.

1557
01:00:33,958 --> 01:00:37,466
LAURA: About how many people does it look like-- I
mean, how big is this camp?

1558
01:00:37,466 --> 01:00:38,399
MATT: How big, the camp?

1559
01:00:38,399 --> 01:00:39,421
LIAM: How many buildings?

1560
01:00:39,421 --> 01:00:42,558
MATT: At a first glance, you can only check out
elements of it from your distance, you're only

1561
01:00:42,558 --> 01:00:48,050
making out shapes from how far back you guys are
without actually getting inside. You gather you've

1562
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:53,744
probably seen throughout, just this portion that
you've come into, anywhere from 30 to 40 duergar

1563
01:00:53,744 --> 01:00:56,442
moving through, as well as a few larger shapes.

1564
01:00:56,442 --> 01:00:57,419
LAURA: (whispers) Oh, shit.

1565
01:00:57,419 --> 01:01:01,822
MATT: You swear you catch one or two other very
large humanoid hulking figures just

1566
01:01:01,822 --> 01:01:02,940
(thudding noises)

1567
01:01:03,045 --> 01:01:04,083
LAURA: Oh no.

1568
01:01:04,083 --> 01:01:05,602
MATT: Stepping through the camp.

1569
01:01:05,602 --> 01:01:06,729
LIAM: How are we gonna get through this?

1570
01:01:06,729 --> 01:01:08,482
LAURA: How are we-- what are we gonna do? What are
we gonna do?

1571
01:01:08,482 --> 01:01:10,012
SAM: The view up here is beautiful!

1572
01:01:10,012 --> 01:01:11,459
LAURA: (sings) A whole new world.

1573
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:13,161
MARISHA: (whispers) Hey, hey, what do you guys
see?

1574
01:01:13,161 --> 01:01:14,264
ORION: Scanlan, what's going on?

1575
01:01:14,264 --> 01:01:15,320
LAURA: (whispers) Okay, so--

1576
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:16,315
SAM: Is the range? How are--

1577
01:01:16,315 --> 01:01:17,654
MATT: The range is getting a little broken, you
can hear--

1578
01:01:17,654 --> 01:01:18,458
LAURA: Okay.

1579
01:01:18,458 --> 01:01:19,638
MATT: The words are coming through but--

1580
01:01:19,638 --> 01:01:21,159
MARISHA: You're cutting out. I can't hear you

1581
01:01:21,159 --> 01:01:22,024
LAURA: Okay.

1582
01:01:22,024 --> 01:01:22,729
LIAM: I think--

1583
01:01:22,729 --> 01:01:23,677
LAURA: Well, one of us.

1584
01:01:23,677 --> 01:01:24,869
SAM: We'll update you soon.

1585
01:01:24,869 --> 01:01:26,012
LAURA: Well, one of us. Let's put down.

1586
01:01:26,012 --> 01:01:26,807
LIAM: Put down?

1587
01:01:26,807 --> 01:01:27,514
TRAVIS: In the volcano?

1588
01:01:27,514 --> 01:01:28,482
LAURA: No no no, how are we, like--

1589
01:01:28,482 --> 01:01:29,262
TRAVIS: Just go straight down.

1590
01:01:29,262 --> 01:01:32,157
LAURA: At a place where we can land the carpet and
stand around.

1591
01:01:32,157 --> 01:01:32,914
SAM: They'll probably see us.

1592
01:01:32,914 --> 01:01:33,690
LAURA: Or should we go back?

1593
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:34,729
LIAM: We're past the chasm at this point or still
afloat?

1594
01:01:34,729 --> 01:01:35,953
MATT: You've just now crested--

1595
01:01:35,953 --> 01:01:37,159
LIAM: The other side.

1596
01:01:37,159 --> 01:01:42,554
MATT: The crevasse the other side. And you're
feeling uncomfortable pushing further forward

1597
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:46,917
because you're now starting to get a lot more eyes
in your vicinity.

1598
01:01:46,917 --> 01:01:50,849
LAURA: Okay, are there any-- does it look like--
do we see any cavern openings in the vicinity?

1599
01:01:50,849 --> 01:01:52,316
Does it look like there's any?

1600
01:01:52,316 --> 01:01:55,271
MATT: Looking around, there are no side caverns,
this is actually a pretty smooth cavern that kind

1601
01:01:55,271 --> 01:02:00,124
of circles around where this camp is built, there
is one large tunnel entrance

1602
01:02:00,124 --> 01:02:02,734
on the opposite side that continues past.

1603
01:02:02,734 --> 01:02:05,220
LAURA: But they're blocking it? Or--

1604
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:08,927
MATT: You can't see anything beyond the fact that
the tunnel-- the walls kind of convene. You can

1605
01:02:08,999 --> 01:02:11,294
see a little bit of a tunnel opening and just
darkness beyond that.

1606
01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:14,375
LIAM: So, bridge to land, and then a tunnel.

1607
01:02:14,375 --> 01:02:17,967
MATT: A tunnel on the other side, and where the
land starts there's a giant portion of the cavern

1608
01:02:17,967 --> 01:02:21,769
that continues and then closes off, kind of
pinches, to the entrance to where the camp is.

1609
01:02:21,769 --> 01:02:24,002
LAURA: How far away is the camp from that?

1610
01:02:24,002 --> 01:02:27,279
MATT: The camp is completely filling this side of
the cross. It's blocking pretty much the whole.

1611
01:02:27,279 --> 01:02:28,705
LAURA: Oh, so we can't get to that.

1612
01:02:28,705 --> 01:02:29,889
MATT: Not without going through or over the city.

1613
01:02:29,889 --> 01:02:30,551
LAURA: What about--

1614
01:02:30,551 --> 01:02:32,282
LIAM: So it's bridge, town, tunnel.

1615
01:02:32,282 --> 01:02:32,975
SAM: Tunnel.

1616
01:02:32,975 --> 01:02:33,737
MATT: Correct.

1617
01:02:33,737 --> 01:02:36,800
LAURA: Do we see any closer-- Under the bridge,
are there any openings

1618
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,509
underneath the bridge that look like--

1619
01:02:38,509 --> 01:02:39,611
MATT: Do you want to swoop down and check?

1620
01:02:39,611 --> 01:02:40,084
LIAM: Yes.

1621
01:02:40,084 --> 01:02:40,688
LAURA: Yeah.

1622
01:02:40,688 --> 01:02:42,001
MATT: Okay, you swoop down and--

1623
01:02:42,001 --> 01:02:43,152
LIAM: (whoosh)

1624
01:02:43,152 --> 01:02:44,358
MATT: --the rock there--

1625
01:02:44,358 --> 01:02:45,340
LAURA: (whoosh)

1626
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:49,533
MATT: (whoosh) -- the warm air is still kinda
bothering you in general.

1627
01:02:49,533 --> 01:02:50,748
LIAM: (makes farting noise)

1628
01:02:50,748 --> 01:02:51,662
LAURA: Excuse me.

1629
01:02:51,662 --> 01:02:55,719
MATT: You find yourself kinda taking your cloak
and putting it over your mouth just to get the

1630
01:02:55,719 --> 01:03:04,567
scent out. The side of the rock surface is worn
through what looks like maybe a possible river

1631
01:03:04,567 --> 01:03:07,836
that also came from the other side that has since
dried out, so you can see there is, while no water

1632
01:03:07,836 --> 01:03:12,279
on this side of the crevasse, a lot of the stone
has been smoothed just through rapid water running

1633
01:03:12,336 --> 01:03:16,305
for thousands of years possibly. But there are no
visible openings

1634
01:03:16,305 --> 01:03:19,551
or other additional caverns on this rock surface

1635
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:20,925
LAURA: What are we gonna do?

1636
01:03:20,925 --> 01:03:21,935
TRAVIS: (whispers) Are they still on--

1637
01:03:21,935 --> 01:03:28,647
SAM: Okay, listen. Leave me behind, I'll follow
the party with the hostages, I'll see where they

1638
01:03:28,647 --> 01:03:33,637
go. Don't worry, I'll be invisible. Go back, tell
our fellows, get them across the bridge,

1639
01:03:33,637 --> 01:03:35,480
and we'll meet here in about an hour.

1640
01:03:35,651 --> 01:03:36,902
MARISHA: Okay.

1641
01:03:36,902 --> 01:03:37,773
LAURA: Scanlan!

1642
01:03:37,773 --> 01:03:38,633
TRAVIS: I like it.

1643
01:03:38,633 --> 01:03:40,341
SAM: What? I'm super brave and hung, come on,
let's do this.

1644
01:03:40,341 --> 01:03:42,869
(all laugh)

1645
01:03:42,869 --> 01:03:45,745
LAURA: All right, I'm down. Should we do it?

1646
01:03:45,745 --> 01:03:46,821
LIAM: All right.

1647
01:03:46,821 --> 01:03:47,986
LAURA: We drop him off.

1648
01:03:47,986 --> 01:03:48,827
SAM: I turn invisible.

1649
01:03:48,827 --> 01:03:50,336
TRAVIS: (sings) Scanlan, the best bard.

1650
01:03:50,336 --> 01:03:52,856
SAM: And I'm gonna just hang behind the party
that's got the hostage dwarves,

1651
01:03:52,856 --> 01:03:54,591
and just kinda see where they go.

1652
01:03:54,591 --> 01:03:55,296
MATT: Okay.

1653
01:03:55,296 --> 01:03:56,234
LAURA: Should one of us protect him?

1654
01:03:56,234 --> 01:03:57,605
TRAVIS: Do you activate hung at the same time?

1655
01:03:57,605 --> 01:03:58,373
SAM: Don't have to activate.

1656
01:03:58,373 --> 01:03:59,293
LIAM: He's invisible, though.

1657
01:03:59,293 --> 01:03:59,994
TRAVIS: Okay.

1658
01:03:59,994 --> 01:04:01,075
LAURA: I mean, we can't go invisible, we can't be
as like--

1659
01:04:01,075 --> 01:04:01,738
LIAM: No.

1660
01:04:01,738 --> 01:04:02,571
SAM: It's passive.

1661
01:04:02,571 --> 01:04:03,433
MARISHA: It's a racial bonus.

1662
01:04:03,433 --> 01:04:04,687
LAURA: He's sneaky, we can't be as invisible as
him. All right.

1663
01:04:04,687 --> 01:04:05,820
SAM: Yeah but I might make-- I might snap twigs.

1664
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:09,605
LIAM: Last question. Where are the people, the
figures we were following?

1665
01:04:09,605 --> 01:04:11,145
Did they finish the bridge at this point?

1666
01:04:11,145 --> 01:04:14,390
MATT: They're long past the bridge, they're inside
the city proper at this point.

1667
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:15,084
LAURA: Okay.

1668
01:04:15,084 --> 01:04:19,859
LIAM: Okay, so then I'll stay by the edge of the
bridge, you go back. Scanlan, go ahead, I'll wait

1669
01:04:19,859 --> 01:04:21,654
for you here, if there's trouble.

1670
01:04:21,654 --> 01:04:23,493
SAM: Ding-a-ling-a-ling!

1671
01:04:23,493 --> 01:04:24,308
LIAM: Yes.

1672
01:04:24,308 --> 01:04:24,898
SAM: Got it.

1673
01:04:24,898 --> 01:04:25,624
LAURA: All right.

1674
01:04:25,624 --> 01:04:26,196
MATT: All right.

1675
01:04:26,196 --> 01:04:27,875
LAURA: I go back, thanks.

1676
01:04:27,875 --> 01:04:28,498
LIAM: Shit.

1677
01:04:28,498 --> 01:04:30,241
LAURA: Thanks for sending me back. I go back.

1678
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:31,427
LIAM: Go get the others.

1679
01:04:31,427 --> 01:04:32,158
MATT: All right.

1680
01:04:32,158 --> 01:04:33,020
MARISHA: Okay.

1681
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:39,016
MATT: Scanlan. As you go ahead, make your way in
towards the city,

1682
01:04:39,016 --> 01:04:40,662
go ahead and make a stealth check with advantage.

1683
01:04:40,662 --> 01:04:42,113
TRAVIS: C'mon, buddy.

1684
01:04:42,113 --> 01:04:46,086
SAM: 16. 18!

1685
01:04:46,154 --> 01:04:52,457
MATT: 18, okay. You push, kind of falling behind
the main group, and they're heading towards this

1686
01:04:52,457 --> 01:04:57,335
kind of, more or less a loose thoroughfare in the
center of this town. You can see a few duergar

1687
01:04:57,335 --> 01:05:01,420
coming out and kind of inspecting as they enter,
speaking in a language you don't understand,

1688
01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:06,576
asking questions, some of them are coming out and
slapping the dwarf captives as they go across, or

1689
01:05:06,576 --> 01:05:11,421
spitting on them. The dwarves look very broken and
unhappy with the circumstance, but brimming with

1690
01:05:11,421 --> 01:05:16,595
anger. You see a couple of them are, like true
dwarves, they haven't given in to it, they're just

1691
01:05:16,595 --> 01:05:21,599
looking for an option or a moment to get some
vengeance. They're stripped of all armor and

1692
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:30,746
weaponry. They're brought through some of the
alleys and paths between these pup tents and these

1693
01:05:30,746 --> 01:05:35,956
stone structures. You can see, there are some of
the hulking figures,

1694
01:05:35,956 --> 01:05:41,205
there are two trolls wandering amongst these 
duergar.

1695
01:05:41,205 --> 01:05:43,431
TRAVIS: Yes! (whispers) Trolls!

1696
01:05:43,431 --> 01:05:45,607
MATT: Now, you've encountered trolls before, but
these trolls--

1697
01:05:45,607 --> 01:05:46,681
LAURA: (gasps) Yeah we have.

1698
01:05:46,681 --> 01:05:50,825
MATT: -- also have a similar, pupil-less, clouded
over, white-eye appearance--

1699
01:05:50,825 --> 01:05:52,954
SAM: Ooh! They're slave trolls!

1700
01:05:52,954 --> 01:05:57,814
MATT: As you begin to follow them further in, you
manage to see two ogres that are currently

1701
01:05:57,814 --> 01:06:07,072
stationed across this main open center location in
this campsite. And both of these ogres also have

1702
01:06:07,072 --> 01:06:11,663
the same, pupil-less, white, glazed-over look to
their eyes. And they're both just kind of glancing

1703
01:06:11,663 --> 01:06:18,536
about. The rest of the duergar are in the process
of constructing other tents. Some of them look

1704
01:06:18,536 --> 01:06:23,815
like they're actually in the process of forging
weaponry. It feels like it's a war camp. It's

1705
01:06:23,815 --> 01:06:28,485
definitely preparing for something. However, in
the center of this main area, you do see, there is

1706
01:06:28,485 --> 01:06:36,917
a wooden platform, about 20 foot by 20 foot, that
is raised up, and you see a group of about six

1707
01:06:36,917 --> 01:06:42,579
duergar that are all wearing very intricate, black
iron plate armor.

1708
01:06:42,579 --> 01:06:45,908
And they're all just sitting on the outskirts 
of this platform.

1709
01:06:45,908 --> 01:06:47,206
SAM: White eyes?

1710
01:06:47,206 --> 01:06:51,271
MATT: All the duergar seem to have that natural
look to their eyes as well.

1711
01:06:51,271 --> 01:06:51,958
TRAVIS: Shit.

1712
01:06:51,958 --> 01:06:52,969
SAM: Okay.

1713
01:06:52,969 --> 01:06:58,866
MATT: As the party you've been following enters
the center of this vicinity,

1714
01:06:58,866 --> 01:07:02,416
make another stealth check, with advantage.

1715
01:07:02,416 --> 01:07:06,738
SAM: Gah. 19.

1716
01:07:06,738 --> 01:07:12,002
MATT: All right. You kind of step off to the side,
a duergar steps out of one of the tents near you,

1717
01:07:12,002 --> 01:07:15,200
and you just barely manage to pull out of the way
without making any sort of squeak or noise.

1718
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:18,993
He goes by. (sniffs)

1719
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:19,994
TRAVIS: Oh god!

1720
01:07:19,994 --> 01:07:20,782
LAURA: Oh god!

1721
01:07:20,782 --> 01:07:21,655
LIAM: Careful, Bilbo!

1722
01:07:21,655 --> 01:07:26,874
MATT: And begins stepping out, looking intently
for something, but right past you, by inches, as

1723
01:07:26,874 --> 01:07:31,870
he walks past. You look over again, to the camp,
and you can now see, toward the very back end of

1724
01:07:31,870 --> 01:07:37,985
this open midsection, by this platform, there is
one large, stone construct. It looks like a

1725
01:07:37,985 --> 01:07:43,187
makeshift barracks has been placed there, with
double stone doors that are currently opened, and

1726
01:07:43,187 --> 01:07:47,475
you can see two figures stepping out of the stairs
that lead into these barracks, heading towards the

1727
01:07:47,475 --> 01:07:54,133
main platform. They step up onto the platform. One
of which is a very, very well-decorated duergar,

1728
01:07:54,133 --> 01:08:00,394
who's wearing similar blackened plate armor as the
other kind of elite guard that you saw surrounding

1729
01:08:00,394 --> 01:08:06,661
this platform, but with gold and silver scrolling
on it, a long, tattered, dark, dark purple cape,

1730
01:08:06,661 --> 01:08:14,168
and has a nasty scar across the cheek that leads
into this kind of gnarled, grey beard. As it steps

1731
01:08:14,168 --> 01:08:19,076
forward, you can see, sheathed off to its back in
a large scabbard, a gargantuan-- for a dwarf

1732
01:08:19,076 --> 01:08:23,130
especially-- two-handed sword that should be
unwieldy for a creature of its size. But

1733
01:08:23,130 --> 01:08:26,768
nevertheless looks dangerous and a creature next
to it is--

1734
01:08:26,768 --> 01:08:28,120
LAURA: (whispers) We can't fight these guys.

1735
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:33,089
MATT: -- not so small, not dwarven. Actually, very
tall, lanky, long, black and purple robes, a

1736
01:08:33,089 --> 01:08:39,373
hood, obscuring its features, stepping roughly two
feet behind it as they both step on to the

1737
01:08:39,373 --> 01:08:43,422
platform to address the rest of the guard and the
approaching party of duergar dwarves you've been

1738
01:08:43,422 --> 01:08:52,617
following. You can see some conversation
happening, but you're too far away to really make

1739
01:08:52,617 --> 01:08:54,762
out anything that's being said, do you want to
move closer?

1740
01:08:54,762 --> 01:08:56,260
SAM: Do I speak their language?

1741
01:08:56,260 --> 01:08:57,797
MATT: Do you speak Undercommon?

1742
01:08:57,797 --> 01:08:58,632
SAM: Nope!

1743
01:08:58,632 --> 01:09:00,848
MATT: Then you-- it all sounds gibberish to you!

1744
01:09:00,848 --> 01:09:02,316
SAM: Then, no thank you. (laughs)

1745
01:09:02,316 --> 01:09:08,663
MATT: Okay. But you see some conversation
happening. This seemingly officious duergar, this

1746
01:09:08,663 --> 01:09:13,609
general that steps out and commands the attention
in the room, makes a few gestures, shouts out to

1747
01:09:13,609 --> 01:09:19,962
amongst the other nearby. Not quite sure, but you
get the idea he's giving orders or directions. The

1748
01:09:19,962 --> 01:09:23,984
war party then begins to pull the slaves back
away, and--

1749
01:09:23,984 --> 01:09:26,733
SAM: The captives? Okay.

1750
01:09:26,733 --> 01:09:30,609
MATT: The captives. Begins pulling them away
toward another section on the side. As it does,

1751
01:09:30,609 --> 01:09:33,594
the tall, lanky figure, which you now get the
sense that it's not really walking.

1752
01:09:33,594 --> 01:09:35,113
It's just kind of drifting--

1753
01:09:35,113 --> 01:09:36,436
SAM: (apprehensive sound)

1754
01:09:36,436 --> 01:09:42,250
MATT: -- holds its hand out. This long, long
finger and lanky hand, and as it does, every

1755
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:45,853
single duergar in the vicinity, whatever it was
doing, stops in place,

1756
01:09:45,853 --> 01:09:48,854
and all turn and look at it, as one.

1757
01:09:48,854 --> 01:09:49,575
SAM: Whoa.

1758
01:09:49,575 --> 01:09:57,272
MATT: At which point, this creature brings its
fingers in a beckoning gesture,

1759
01:09:57,272 --> 01:09:59,986
loosely in your direction.

1760
01:09:59,986 --> 01:10:04,658
SAM: I'm wearing my ring of mind-shielding, by the
way.

1761
01:10:04,737 --> 01:10:09,670
MATT: For a split second, you feel your heart at
your throat, and the entire back of your body

1762
01:10:09,753 --> 01:10:16,889
stands on pins and needles as one of the duergar
carrying one of the captives begins to pull one of

1763
01:10:16,889 --> 01:10:23,629
the dwarven captives back towards the platform. As
it does, the dwarf, who is giving kind of a fight

1764
01:10:23,629 --> 01:10:30,489
and looks nervous, looks over at the figure and
its arms go limp to its side, and it begins to

1765
01:10:30,489 --> 01:10:34,794
walk out of its own volition, taking two, three
steps. Steps onto the platform and approaches this

1766
01:10:34,794 --> 01:10:39,788
tall, lanky figure with the hood and long robes
behind it. As it does, its hand reaches out and

1767
01:10:39,788 --> 01:10:49,805
caresses the side of this dwarf's face. This dwarf
seems to have given up all sense of fight or any

1768
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:57,858
sort of conflict and just stares up into this
darkened hood. As the tall, lanky creature reaches

1769
01:10:57,858 --> 01:11:02,524
out with both hands and pulls the dwarf forward,
you see these terrible purple tentacles come

1770
01:11:02,524 --> 01:11:07,174
writhing out of the front of the hood, wrapping
around the head of the dwarf, pulling it into it.

1771
01:11:07,174 --> 01:11:14,062
As the hood falls back, you see this horrible
smooth, purplish-blue hairless head, these sunken

1772
01:11:14,062 --> 01:11:19,692
yellowish-green eyes as the tentacles wrap around
the dwarf's head and pulls it into its mouth.

1773
01:11:19,692 --> 01:11:26,004
There's a brief struggle, and then the dwarf's
arms fall limp to its side. At which point, the

1774
01:11:26,004 --> 01:11:32,849
tentacles unravel from its head, the creature
pulls back, a bit of ichor and dwarf blood

1775
01:11:32,849 --> 01:11:39,215
dripping from what looks like a lamprey's toothy
maw, and then thrusts the body to the ground, with

1776
01:11:39,215 --> 01:11:42,356
a thud as it falls lifeless to the ground.

1777
01:11:42,356 --> 01:11:43,779
SAM: Poor son of a bitch.

1778
01:11:43,779 --> 01:11:50,954
MATT: A horrible, bored hole in its forehead. The
creature then draws its hood back up, releases its

1779
01:11:50,954 --> 01:11:54,765
hand in a cursory fashion, and all the duergar
whip back around and continue the motions they

1780
01:11:54,765 --> 01:11:59,950
were previously going towards. As the two dwarven
captives that now remain look completely stunned,

1781
01:11:59,950 --> 01:12:07,113
their faces white with fear as they are being
dragged off in this state. The tall, lanky figure

1782
01:12:07,113 --> 01:12:13,470
gives a nod to the duergar general, who gives a
nod as well, then to turn around and walk back.

1783
01:12:13,470 --> 01:12:15,771
LAURA: Oh god.

1784
01:12:15,771 --> 01:12:23,752
SAM: Worst show ever. Okay. That was one of the
captives.

1785
01:12:23,752 --> 01:12:26,642
Do I see where the other captives were taken?

1786
01:12:26,642 --> 01:12:32,822
MATT: The two other captives, you follow them?
They both are pulled to-- essentially to a western

1787
01:12:32,822 --> 01:12:39,421
side. If you look overhead, this is where the
barrack building is, this is where you entered and

1788
01:12:39,421 --> 01:12:48,130
this is the main area. They are pulled off to the
western side here. They are taken to a large tent.

1789
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:52,728
As they are pulled in, they close it behind them.
You can hear some muffles

1790
01:12:52,728 --> 01:12:55,548
and some growling from the inside of the tent.

1791
01:12:55,548 --> 01:13:02,274
SAM: Okay. I assume bad things are happening in
there, I don't need to see it, right? I think I'll

1792
01:13:02,274 --> 01:13:04,781
just kind of-- is there anything--

1793
01:13:04,781 --> 01:13:06,464
MATT: Do you speak Dwarven?

1794
01:13:06,464 --> 01:13:11,302
SAM: No, oh, no, do I? What do I speak? Where does
it say? Shit.

1795
01:13:11,302 --> 01:13:13,904
MATT: Should be on the lower left-hand of your
player sheet.

1796
01:13:13,904 --> 01:13:16,548
LAURA: Did you choose languages?

1797
01:13:16,548 --> 01:13:21,023
SAM: I play a shawm. No, I just speak Common and
Gnome.

1798
01:13:21,023 --> 01:13:26,511
MATT: You hear what sounds like guttural Dwarvish
being shouted angrily, cursing from the interior,

1799
01:13:26,511 --> 01:13:35,980
and a few other dwarven voices also joining in--
more than two. You hear some horrible, sick thuds

1800
01:13:35,980 --> 01:13:42,548
and some impacts and some cries of pain. And
eventually, the five duergar dragging the captives

1801
01:13:42,714 --> 01:13:47,418
walk out, carrying cudgels at their side, still
dripping with fresh blood.

1802
01:13:47,418 --> 01:13:50,827
They kind of go amongst their own business 
from there.

1803
01:13:50,827 --> 01:13:58,851
SAM: Okay. I think I'll go back to my fellows.
There's nothing I can see-- that door doesn't

1804
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:00,971
lock-- does it lock by any chance?

1805
01:14:00,971 --> 01:14:02,567
MATT: It's just an opening tent.

1806
01:14:02,567 --> 01:14:09,331
SAM: Open tent. There's nothing lying around, none
of that black armor lying around or anything?

1807
01:14:09,331 --> 01:14:11,485
Any extra things --

1808
01:14:11,485 --> 01:14:12,800
MATT: Not on the street.

1809
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:16,186
SAM: Okay, I think I will just make back for my
friends, then.

1810
01:14:16,186 --> 01:14:17,453
MATT: Okay, make a stealth check.

1811
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:19,203
LAURA: Oh, god.

1812
01:14:19,203 --> 01:14:19,949
SAM: With advantage?

1813
01:14:19,949 --> 01:14:20,811
MATT: With advantage.

1814
01:14:20,811 --> 01:14:22,517
(all laugh)

1815
01:14:22,517 --> 01:14:25,344
SAM: 21.

1816
01:14:25,344 --> 01:14:29,862
MATT: You maneuver your way out back the way you
came, best you can, remembering-- you get

1817
01:14:29,862 --> 01:14:33,634
disoriented in general trying to find your way
out. Go ahead and make a survival check.

1818
01:14:33,634 --> 01:14:35,264
LAURA: Oh no!

1819
01:14:35,264 --> 01:14:39,590
SAM: Survival check, so plus zero. 17.

1820
01:14:39,590 --> 01:14:40,382
MATT: 17.

1821
01:14:40,382 --> 01:14:41,465
LAURA: That's a good roll, yo.

1822
01:14:41,465 --> 01:14:45,753
MATT: Okay, you take a moment, orient yourself,
looking about the cavern. This is a very confusing

1823
01:14:45,753 --> 01:14:48,062
network, and the passages you've gone-- you paid
more attention to what's happening--

1824
01:14:48,062 --> 01:14:49,150
SAM: It's like Venice.

1825
01:14:49,150 --> 01:14:52,543
MATT: Kind of, yeah. You nearly get lost twice,
but eventually find your way back to the

1826
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:58,437
southern-portion entrance of this war camp. You
can just see the crevasse and you start getting

1827
01:14:58,437 --> 01:15:02,937
the familiar scent of that sulfurous wind that was
billowing out from underneath. You step out a few

1828
01:15:02,937 --> 01:15:06,337
more feet, and you can see the edge of the bridge
where the rest of you have finally come to converge

1829
01:15:06,337 --> 01:15:08,304
on the other side of the crevasse.

1830
01:15:08,371 --> 01:15:09,226
LAURA: Ooh!

1831
01:15:09,226 --> 01:15:13,668
SAM: Whoa. I am going to tell you everything that
just happened, in detail, in real time.

1832
01:15:13,668 --> 01:15:18,324
(all laugh)

1833
01:15:18,324 --> 01:15:22,382
LAURA: Maybe he can tell us while we are taking a
bathroom break?

1834
01:15:22,382 --> 01:15:24,866
MATT: You know what, let's go ahead and take this
moment to have a bathroom break,

1835
01:15:24,866 --> 01:15:26,541
guys, as sort of the halfway mark.

1836
01:15:26,541 --> 01:15:27,524
MARISHA: Holy shit.

1837
01:15:27,524 --> 01:15:31,059
MATT: We will continue this in just a moment. In
the meantime, take a rest, take ten or 11 minutes.

1838
01:15:31,059 --> 01:15:34,751
We are going to play our character backgrounds for
those who haven't seen it.

1839
01:15:34,751 --> 01:15:36,311
We will be back here in about ten minutes, guys.

1840
01:15:36,311 --> 01:15:37,676
MARISHA: What are we going to do?

1841
01:15:37,676 --> 01:15:39,188
TRAVIS: We are gonna fight the shit out of them.

1842
01:15:39,188 --> 01:15:40,227
LIAM: We're going to risk it all.

1843
01:15:40,227 --> 01:27:10,579
[break]

1844
01:27:10,643 --> 01:27:20,202
[no audio]

1845
01:27:20,202 --> 01:27:25,386
MATT: -- for her as well, so look forward to that
some point in the near future. As we left off, the

1846
01:27:25,386 --> 01:27:30,380
party had just reconvened on the other side of
this gargantuan crevasse in the Underdark, after

1847
01:27:30,380 --> 01:27:38,362
Scanlan had stealthed into the duergar war camp,
witnessed a number of dwarven captives being taken

1848
01:27:38,415 --> 01:27:45,774
somewhere, however, one of which was devoured by
some strange creature. Left brainless and dead on

1849
01:27:45,774 --> 01:27:50,639
the platform in the center, outside of a giant
barracks-type building. You reconvened and

1850
01:27:50,639 --> 01:27:52,647
expressed all of this information to the party.

1851
01:27:52,647 --> 01:27:55,140
SAM: And that's when I came back to see you guys.

1852
01:27:55,140 --> 01:27:56,421
(all laugh)

1853
01:27:56,421 --> 01:27:57,225
TRAVIS: Great.

1854
01:27:57,225 --> 01:27:59,031
TALIESIN: Wonderfully detailed.

1855
01:27:59,031 --> 01:28:00,364
LAURA: What are we going to do?

1856
01:28:00,364 --> 01:28:02,487
MARISHA: I give Scanlan some water from my water
skin.

1857
01:28:02,561 --> 01:28:04,354
LIAM: You are a brave little fellow.

1858
01:28:04,354 --> 01:28:05,742
SAM: Thank you.

1859
01:28:05,742 --> 01:28:11,446
LAURA: Has anyone come across these creatures
before? These weird tentacle brain guys?

1860
01:28:11,516 --> 01:28:16,174
MARISHA: I've heard rumors of those. Can we make a
check for those?

1861
01:28:16,174 --> 01:28:19,963
ORION: It sounds like it would be a mind flayer,
of sorts.

1862
01:28:19,963 --> 01:28:21,332
LAURA: A mind flayer?

1863
01:28:21,332 --> 01:28:24,231
ORION: A mind flayer or mind slayer, I'm not too
sure.

1864
01:28:24,231 --> 01:28:26,133
SAM: What is that?

1865
01:28:26,133 --> 01:28:30,382
ORION: I'm pretty sure it flays your mind. I'm
never encountered one myself, so I have no idea,

1866
01:28:30,382 --> 01:28:33,917
really. Oh, right, let me check my books.

1867
01:28:33,917 --> 01:28:38,668
MATT: Intelligence.

1868
01:28:38,668 --> 01:28:40,032
ORION: 14.

1869
01:28:40,032 --> 01:28:42,727
MATT: You probably call it a mind flayer.

1870
01:28:42,727 --> 01:28:48,622
ORION: It says right here, mind flayer. The rest
is all inked up. I got water on it.

1871
01:28:48,622 --> 01:28:49,864
(all laugh)

1872
01:28:49,864 --> 01:28:53,959
TRAVIS: How big was this mind flayer, was he like
20 feet tall, Scanlan?

1873
01:28:53,959 --> 01:28:58,977
SAM: He was tall, I mean everyone looks 20 feet
tall to me, I'm a gnome.

1874
01:28:58,977 --> 01:29:01,038
TRAVIS: Was he bigger than me?

1875
01:29:01,038 --> 01:29:04,352
SAM: He was bigger than you by a little?

1876
01:29:04,427 --> 01:29:08,757
MATT: No, roughly a little shorter than him. But
taller than most.

1877
01:29:08,757 --> 01:29:11,574
SAM: He carried himself big. He was lanky.

1878
01:29:11,574 --> 01:29:13,162
TRAVIS: Let's go fuck him up.

1879
01:29:13,162 --> 01:29:14,085
LAURA: No, Grog!

1880
01:29:14,085 --> 01:29:14,805
TRAVIS: What?

1881
01:29:14,805 --> 01:29:18,222
LAURA: Do you want to be unconscious again? We
have to be careful here.

1882
01:29:18,222 --> 01:29:19,689
TRAVIS: It was rather restful.

1883
01:29:19,689 --> 01:29:23,194
LAURA: How many dwarves did it sound like there
were locked in that prison cell?

1884
01:29:23,194 --> 01:29:25,282
SAM: Several?

1885
01:29:25,282 --> 01:29:26,828
MARISHA: Did you see Lady Kima?

1886
01:29:26,828 --> 01:29:35,216
SAM: No sign of Lady Kima at all, just a bunch of
dwarves being held against their will, and then

1887
01:29:35,216 --> 01:29:39,603
one by one being brain sucked by Mr. Lanky Man.

1888
01:29:39,603 --> 01:29:41,503
TRAVIS: And those two big trolls.

1889
01:29:41,503 --> 01:29:43,358
ORION: Percy, could you take a look at this?

1890
01:29:43,358 --> 01:29:45,878
SAM: Two big trolls, and ogres, don't forget
ogres, there's ogres too.

1891
01:29:45,878 --> 01:29:46,806
TRAVIS: There are ogres?

1892
01:29:46,806 --> 01:29:50,924
SAM: Yes, there were two big ogres as well. And
duergar aplenty--

1893
01:29:50,924 --> 01:29:53,025
maybe four dozen or so, three dozen?

1894
01:29:53,025 --> 01:29:57,136
LIAM: Spread throughout the city, throughout this
little camp, Scanlan.

1895
01:29:57,136 --> 01:29:58,155
SAM: Wandering. Yes.

1896
01:29:58,155 --> 01:29:59,155
TRAVIS: You know my tactic.

1897
01:29:59,155 --> 01:30:01,861
TALIESIN: Would it be a nature check to actually
think if I never learned about this in school?

1898
01:30:01,861 --> 01:30:04,149
MATT: This would be an intelligence check.

1899
01:30:04,333 --> 01:30:06,960
TALIESIN: This would be an intelligence check?

1900
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:14,221
TRAVIS: We should use the volcano as part of our
strategy. Like Moses--

1901
01:30:14,221 --> 01:30:16,610
SAM: There's a volcano?

1902
01:30:16,610 --> 01:30:18,372
TRAVIS: Well no, the pit--

1903
01:30:18,372 --> 01:30:19,548
SAM: Oh the lava, down below?

1904
01:30:19,548 --> 01:30:21,723
TRAVIS: Yeah, there's a shitload of that.

1905
01:30:21,723 --> 01:30:26,860
MARISHA: Can I meditate to see if I know anything
about this--

1906
01:30:26,860 --> 01:30:32,159
LIAM: This seems to match up with the tales that
my instructor, master Tharendril, told me about

1907
01:30:32,159 --> 01:30:39,428
back in Syngorn. I wonder if I remember something.
If only I had a small polyhedral to roll-- Wow!

1908
01:30:39,428 --> 01:30:40,861
LAURA: Holy moly, you guys.

1909
01:30:40,861 --> 01:30:42,400
TRAVIS: Oh, shitcakes.

1910
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:44,788
TALIESIN: It's a stack of pizzas.

1911
01:30:44,788 --> 01:30:46,954
MATT: Why are you guys so awesome?

1912
01:30:46,954 --> 01:30:48,176
LAURA: You guys are amazing!

1913
01:30:48,176 --> 01:30:49,285
MARISHA: Yeah, what the hell?

1914
01:30:49,285 --> 01:30:51,900
SAM: Do they know the address here? That's kinda
creepy.

1915
01:30:51,900 --> 01:31:01,638
LAURA: Ah, thank you! I was wanting some ice tea!

1916
01:31:01,711 --> 01:31:03,032
MARISHA: Thanks chat room!

1917
01:31:03,090 --> 01:31:04,150
SAM: Thanks chat room!

1918
01:31:04,208 --> 01:31:05,377
LIAM: Thanks! Thank you, long list.

1919
01:31:05,377 --> 01:31:09,048
TRAVIS: May your list be ever long, with your--
list.

1920
01:31:09,048 --> 01:31:16,126
MATT: So, best you can ascertain, you've never
heard the term mind flayer. But in your people

1921
01:31:16,126 --> 01:31:20,753
you've heard stories and tales growing up about
something referred to as an illithid.

1922
01:31:20,753 --> 01:31:21,608
TRAVIS: A what?

1923
01:31:21,608 --> 01:31:22,457
SAM: An illithid?

1924
01:31:22,457 --> 01:31:23,263
MARISHA: An illithid.

1925
01:31:23,263 --> 01:31:27,073
MATT: A nasty entity, from beyond.

1926
01:31:27,073 --> 01:31:29,042
MARISHA: Illithid, with a D or a T?

1927
01:31:29,042 --> 01:31:36,441
MATT: With a D.

1928
01:31:36,441 --> 01:31:40,765
As far as you know, all that you've heard,
is that they were considered ghost stories, as a

1929
01:31:40,932 --> 01:31:49,196
kid, to keep you from wandering dark caves and
spaces. They would take your minds, and you

1930
01:31:49,196 --> 01:31:55,273
thought this whole time that that was just a
fable. That it was just a tale. But you do know

1931
01:31:55,273 --> 01:32:03,704
that they normally aren't solitary; they usually
keep company of a colony.

1932
01:32:03,704 --> 01:32:04,774
LAURA: (gasps)

1933
01:32:04,774 --> 01:32:05,407
TRAVIS: Fudge.

1934
01:32:05,407 --> 01:32:06,180
LIAM: Shit.

1935
01:32:06,180 --> 01:32:08,785
MARISHA: But I've never heard them called a mind
flayer, but I guess they could be called a mind

1936
01:32:08,785 --> 01:32:15,260
flayer. But we call them Illithids. I didn't know
they were real, though.

1937
01:32:15,490 --> 01:32:18,073
LAURA: What do we do?

1938
01:32:18,073 --> 01:32:27,081
TRAVIS: Why don't we-- Listen, when my Herd used
to wander through the trees and we came upon a

1939
01:32:27,081 --> 01:32:33,387
force that was greater than our own, we used the
landscape to our ad-van-tage, so why don't we

1940
01:32:33,555 --> 01:32:38,816
provoke an attack? And then retreat over the
bridge.

1941
01:32:38,816 --> 01:32:41,963
SAM: And have them all jump over the edge of the
cliff?

1942
01:32:41,963 --> 01:32:43,678
TRAVIS: You said they were all gray-eyed, right?

1943
01:32:43,678 --> 01:32:46,957
LAURA: At least they'll have to go one at a time,
or two at a time across the bridge.

1944
01:32:46,957 --> 01:32:50,343
MARISHA: But Scanlan, didn't you also say that
they were, like, levitating?

1945
01:32:50,343 --> 01:32:51,494
TRAVIS: What?

1946
01:32:51,494 --> 01:32:54,253
MATT: The one lengthy creature.

1947
01:32:54,253 --> 01:32:56,906
SAM: The one lengthy creature was levitating.

1948
01:32:56,906 --> 01:32:58,723
LAURA: Well, I mean, can he fly, or can he
levitate?

1949
01:32:58,723 --> 01:33:03,137
SAM: Well yes, but I think what Grog is talking
about is the bulk of the fighting force, getting

1950
01:33:03,137 --> 01:33:05,508
them to follow us over the bridge and then cutting
the bridge.

1951
01:33:05,508 --> 01:33:12,018
TRAVIS: Yeah, like in 300. Which was a great
puppet show I saw.

1952
01:33:12,018 --> 01:33:15,241
ORION: Oh Grog, I heard that, where they used 300
puppets!

1953
01:33:15,241 --> 01:33:15,986
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1954
01:33:15,986 --> 01:33:16,858
ORION: It's amazing!

1955
01:33:16,858 --> 01:33:18,238
LAURA: Okay, I like this plan.

1956
01:33:18,238 --> 01:33:24,154
LIAM: What if all but a couple of us snuck into
one of these buildings and waited and a couple of

1957
01:33:24,154 --> 01:33:29,938
us made a stink and got a significant number of
them to chase across the bridge.

1958
01:33:29,938 --> 01:33:31,197
SAM: That's a good idea.

1959
01:33:31,197 --> 01:33:34,897
LIAM: But then how could we cut the bridge behind?
We have a flying carpet so we can go back and

1960
01:33:34,897 --> 01:33:39,198
forth, but we could drop a significant number of
them down into the lava.

1961
01:33:39,198 --> 01:33:45,086
MARISHA: Can we have Tiberius standing there to
just Firebolt it?

1962
01:33:45,086 --> 01:33:46,170
TRAVIS: What's the bridge made of?

1963
01:33:46,170 --> 01:33:47,444
SAM: Do you want the rope?

1964
01:33:47,444 --> 01:33:49,031
ORION: Wait a minute. We want to bait them, is
that what we're trying to do?

1965
01:33:49,031 --> 01:33:50,989
SAM: No, we want to drop the bridge and have them
fall to their deaths.

1966
01:33:50,989 --> 01:33:51,913
LAURA: Or, Scanlan--

1967
01:33:51,913 --> 01:33:52,632
SAM: Yes?

1968
01:33:52,632 --> 01:33:56,498
LAURA: Or, what if you let off a stink bomb in the
middle of the camp?

1969
01:33:56,498 --> 01:33:58,117
SAM: Well, they would run willy-nilly!

1970
01:33:58,117 --> 01:34:01,324
LAURA: Some of them would try to leave across the
bridge.

1971
01:34:01,324 --> 01:34:04,199
SAM: Well remember, there's a tunnel on the other
side of camp. They could run that way as well.

1972
01:34:04,199 --> 01:34:07,508
LIAM: It's also a huge, and your stink-cloud is
only, you know, 20 or 30 feet across.

1973
01:34:07,508 --> 01:34:08,442
SAM: 20 feet.

1974
01:34:08,442 --> 01:34:09,412
TRAVIS: "Only".

1975
01:34:09,412 --> 01:34:12,017
ORION: How long is the bridge?

1976
01:34:12,017 --> 01:34:18,380
MATT: The bridge, now that you've traversed it,
it's ten feet wide, and runs about a little over

1977
01:34:18,380 --> 01:34:20,651
200 feet or 250 feet in length.

1978
01:34:20,651 --> 01:34:22,693
SAM: You can get a lot of them on that bridge and
then cut it.

1979
01:34:22,693 --> 01:34:24,818
ORION: True.

1980
01:34:24,818 --> 01:34:28,245
TRAVIS: Makes their numbers count for nothing.

1981
01:34:28,245 --> 01:34:31,388
MARISHA: I think I've heard that one. That puppet
show.

1982
01:34:31,388 --> 01:34:32,524
SAM: I like that idea.

1983
01:34:32,524 --> 01:34:33,938
ORION: I think I might have a solution.

1984
01:34:33,938 --> 01:34:35,831
LAURA: Yes, Tiberius? Speak your mind.

1985
01:34:35,831 --> 01:34:38,372
ORION: I think it's about time I used these.

1986
01:34:38,372 --> 01:34:39,390
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

1987
01:34:39,390 --> 01:34:44,070
ORION: For non-combat things. I think we should
create a diversion, but let me do it. I can use my

1988
01:34:44,070 --> 01:34:48,711
deck of illusions to generate any kind of number
of sorts of creatures or whatever that I can

1989
01:34:48,711 --> 01:34:56,067
control. I can simply toss one out, I believe 50
feet ahead of me, and control it and get their

1990
01:34:56,067 --> 01:35:01,272
attention. I can draw them back through the
bridge, using the illusions, taunting them along

1991
01:35:01,272 --> 01:35:07,648
the way. They, of course, will give chase, because
they are (chuckles) idiots. And, as soon as we get

1992
01:35:07,648 --> 01:35:11,300
enough, we can all-- you can hack away at the
bridge all you like, Grog.

1993
01:35:11,300 --> 01:35:13,379
We could both burn it, we could hack and burn.

1994
01:35:13,379 --> 01:35:15,152
TRAVIS: What kind of creatures can you make?

1995
01:35:15,152 --> 01:35:17,276
ORION: Well, that's all up to the deck.

1996
01:35:17,276 --> 01:35:18,840
SAM: It's up to the deck, or it's up to you?

1997
01:35:18,840 --> 01:35:19,938
ORION: It's up to the deck.

1998
01:35:19,938 --> 01:35:20,940
LAURA: Let's try it!

1999
01:35:20,940 --> 01:35:23,412
SAM: So, what if it's a scary thing that scares
them away?

2000
01:35:23,412 --> 01:35:32,289
ORION: If I generate something such as-- as
exquisite as a red dragon, say, I'm sure somebody

2001
01:35:32,289 --> 01:35:35,911
like the mindfellows-- If they do flee, the camp
will be empty and we can search it and free the

2002
01:35:35,911 --> 01:35:39,948
slaves. If not, they will give chase and they will
come and bait it.

2003
01:35:39,948 --> 01:35:41,648
Either way, it works in our favor.

2004
01:35:41,648 --> 01:35:45,666
TRAVIS: Can I test something real quick? If I pull
out the magic carpet or I take it back from

2005
01:35:45,704 --> 01:35:52,978
whoever the fuck had it, and I stand on it, does
it hold me up or do I sink?

2006
01:35:52,978 --> 01:35:58,990
MATT: You get on top of the carpet and you will it
to begin to shift, and the carpet around you

2007
01:35:58,990 --> 01:36:03,001
lifts, but you are anchoring it to the ground.

2008
01:36:03,001 --> 01:36:04,394
TRAVIS: So this is a big problem.

2009
01:36:04,394 --> 01:36:06,588
LAURA: But you've got Feather Fall. You've got
Feather Fall! Is that still a thing?

2010
01:36:06,588 --> 01:36:08,351
TRAVIS: Yeah, which just slows my fall. It doesn't
take me across.

2011
01:36:08,351 --> 01:36:09,942
SAM: That might not be a thing anymore.

2012
01:36:09,942 --> 01:36:10,820
ORION: I do have Feather Fall.

2013
01:36:10,820 --> 01:36:13,531
LAURA: But Levitate or something-- but we could
tie a rope to you and it can--

2014
01:36:13,531 --> 01:36:14,687
LIAM: It makes him lighter, yeah.

2015
01:36:14,687 --> 01:36:17,936
LAURA: -- it makes you really light, and we can
just drag you behind us. Yeah, it'll work.

2016
01:36:17,936 --> 01:36:19,715
SAM: Why do we need to float Grog?

2017
01:36:19,715 --> 01:36:20,657
TRAVIS: If we cut the bridge.

2018
01:36:20,657 --> 01:36:21,933
LAURA: In case we destroy the bridge.

2019
01:36:21,933 --> 01:36:22,753
SAM: Oh.

2020
01:36:22,753 --> 01:36:25,734
ORION: Oh, don't worry about that, Grog. I'll just
cast Fly on you, because I can fly.

2021
01:36:25,734 --> 01:36:27,133
TRAVIS: You can just Fly me?

2022
01:36:27,133 --> 01:36:29,419
ORION: Yes. We can both fly.

2023
01:36:29,419 --> 01:36:30,275
TRAVIS: Okay.

2024
01:36:30,275 --> 01:36:31,769
LAURA: And you can Fly Trinket, too?

2025
01:36:31,769 --> 01:36:32,675
ORION: Of course, the bear.

2026
01:36:32,675 --> 01:36:33,430
LAURA: Of course.

2027
01:36:33,430 --> 01:36:34,212
TRAVIS: I'm down for doing this.

2028
01:36:34,212 --> 01:36:35,049
LAURA: Let's do it! Do it!

2029
01:36:35,049 --> 01:36:36,011
MARISHA: Flying from the--

2030
01:36:36,011 --> 01:36:36,785
ORION: We have ways across.

2031
01:36:36,785 --> 01:36:38,195
MARISHA: Okay, okay, hang on, hang on.

2032
01:36:38,195 --> 01:36:39,159
TALIESIN: This is a good plan.

2033
01:36:39,159 --> 01:36:39,947
SAM: Wait, wait, wait. Are we--

2034
01:36:39,947 --> 01:36:41,758
MARISHA: So, let's have a failsafe in case a few
get across the bridge.

2035
01:36:41,758 --> 01:36:45,043
SAM: Let's also recap which plan we're going with.
One of us creating a diversion and running away,

2036
01:36:45,043 --> 01:36:46,945
or these mystical, magical--

2037
01:36:46,945 --> 01:36:48,003
TRAVIS: I like the mystical, magical--

2038
01:36:48,003 --> 01:36:51,037
SAM: -- weird dragon creatures. What if they scare
them the other way?

2039
01:36:51,037 --> 01:36:53,123
TALIESIN: It would have to be pretty scary. And
then, hey, that works.

2040
01:36:53,123 --> 01:36:54,990
ORION: I just said, the path would be clear.

2041
01:36:54,990 --> 01:36:55,910
SAM: What if--

2042
01:36:55,910 --> 01:36:57,526
LIAM: Well, are we scaring them or are we luring
them?

2043
01:36:57,526 --> 01:36:58,783
SAM: Also, might I remind--

2044
01:36:58,783 --> 01:37:00,412
ORION: It's all up to the deck.

2045
01:37:00,412 --> 01:37:03,119
SAM: We're luring them. And also, might I remind
you all, that they're being

2046
01:37:03,119 --> 01:37:07,489
mind controlled by this, what, illithid--

2047
01:37:07,489 --> 01:37:08,503
TRAVIS: Davy Jones.

2048
01:37:08,503 --> 01:37:09,298
LAURA: I feel like we should try to--

2049
01:37:09,298 --> 01:37:10,476
MARISHA: Illithid.

2050
01:37:10,476 --> 01:37:12,434
SAM: And if the illithid recognizes that your--

2051
01:37:12,434 --> 01:37:14,430
LAURA: Wait, wait!

2052
01:37:14,430 --> 01:37:16,883
SAM: -- your things are false, then he's not going
to send his men--

2053
01:37:16,883 --> 01:37:17,793
LAURA: That's true.

2054
01:37:17,793 --> 01:37:18,960
SAM: -- off to chase them.

2055
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:20,883
TALIESIN: Or he may send them to kill whoever is
creating the illusion.

2056
01:37:20,883 --> 01:37:21,543
ORION: Exactly.

2057
01:37:21,543 --> 01:37:24,451
SAM: However, if we were-- hm.

2058
01:37:24,451 --> 01:37:25,543
ORION: Either way, they're coming for us.

2059
01:37:25,543 --> 01:37:30,274
LAURA: Maybe we could create a distraction and
bring them away from the tunnel's entrance and we

2060
01:37:30,274 --> 01:37:34,643
can just sneak around them. No?

2061
01:37:34,643 --> 01:37:37,264
ORION: I mean, did you see a way to do that?

2062
01:37:37,264 --> 01:37:41,186
SAM: What? To sneak through the village to the
tunnel? No! Not all seven of us.

2063
01:37:41,186 --> 01:37:43,353
And a bear. Are you crazy?

2064
01:37:43,353 --> 01:37:45,974
(all laugh)

2065
01:37:45,974 --> 01:37:50,229
LAURA: Oh no, he's trying to kill us. All right.

2066
01:37:50,229 --> 01:37:54,787
TRAVIS: I'll stay on this side of the bridge, who
wants to go be a distraction? Who wants to be the

2067
01:37:54,787 --> 01:37:56,807
bait? Who's real fast?

2068
01:37:56,807 --> 01:37:58,814
SAM: Wait, are we doing his bait or are we doing a
real bait?

2069
01:37:58,814 --> 01:37:59,571
TRAVIS: I don't--

2070
01:37:59,571 --> 01:38:00,611
ORION: We can try both.

2071
01:38:00,611 --> 01:38:02,812
TRAVIS: What if you cast something big and they
turn it against us? That could suck.

2072
01:38:02,812 --> 01:38:04,336
ORION: Oh!

2073
01:38:04,336 --> 01:38:06,057
SAM: It's fake. It's just a hologram.

2074
01:38:06,057 --> 01:38:06,812
LAURA: It's not--

2075
01:38:06,812 --> 01:38:07,789
ORION: It's an illusion that I control.

2076
01:38:07,789 --> 01:38:09,042
TRAVIS: How about we throw one of those and
send--

2077
01:38:09,042 --> 01:38:09,801
LAURA: Yeah.

2078
01:38:09,801 --> 01:38:13,902
TRAVIS: How about 50/50 it? One fake, one real.
One of us, one of the cards.

2079
01:38:13,902 --> 01:38:15,133
LIAM: I'll go.

2080
01:38:15,133 --> 01:38:16,310
TRAVIS: Somebody be Gambit and throw that bitch.

2081
01:38:16,310 --> 01:38:18,471
MARISHA: We really just need someone to keep them
from running through that tunnel.

2082
01:38:18,471 --> 01:38:19,188
LAURA: Yeah.

2083
01:38:19,188 --> 01:38:20,519
MARISHA: We need some way to keep them from
coming-- going--

2084
01:38:20,519 --> 01:38:23,784
LAURA: Can you send a card that looks like a
dragon on the other side, in the tunnel,

2085
01:38:23,784 --> 01:38:25,698
and then they run towards us.

2086
01:38:25,698 --> 01:38:27,061
MARISHA: Oh, oh, oh! Wait, wait.

2087
01:38:27,061 --> 01:38:28,049
TRAVIS: What's wrong with them running away from
us?

2088
01:38:28,049 --> 01:38:28,957
SAM: Oh, snap.

2089
01:38:28,957 --> 01:38:35,069
MARISHA: I actually have a spell, while I was
reading through my book last night, catching up on

2090
01:38:35,069 --> 01:38:40,979
spells that I kinda forgot about. I learned
something called Hallucinatory Terrain, where I

2091
01:38:40,979 --> 01:38:45,334
can make the entire terrain look like whatever I
want.

2092
01:38:45,334 --> 01:38:47,107
SAM: Other terrain or an animal?

2093
01:38:47,107 --> 01:38:48,320
MARISHA: Other terrain.

2094
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:50,000
TRAVIS: They're mind controlled--

2095
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,374
MARISHA: What I can do, is--

2096
01:38:51,374 --> 01:38:54,611
LAURA: You can make the chasm look like it's solid
ground!

2097
01:38:54,611 --> 01:38:56,990
SAM: Can you make the chasm look like it's solid
ground?

2098
01:38:56,990 --> 01:38:57,627
TRAVIS: Ooh!

2099
01:38:57,627 --> 01:38:59,182
MARISHA: I can make the chasm look like it's solid
ground--

2100
01:38:59,182 --> 01:39:00,234
SAM: Can she do this?

2101
01:39:00,234 --> 01:39:01,315
MATT: She can try.

2102
01:39:01,315 --> 01:39:01,979
SAM: Yes!

2103
01:39:01,979 --> 01:39:02,794
TRAVIS: I like it!

2104
01:39:02,794 --> 01:39:03,979
MARISHA: I can make the tunnel across the way look
like it's caved in.

2105
01:39:03,979 --> 01:39:06,205
LAURA: Make the big chasm look like solid ground.
They'll fall off the edge!

2106
01:39:06,205 --> 01:39:07,107
TALIESIN: That's a great plan.

2107
01:39:07,107 --> 01:39:08,128
LIAM: That's a great idea, but let's--

2108
01:39:08,128 --> 01:39:09,709
ORION: I'll throw the illusion on the fake lands.

2109
01:39:09,709 --> 01:39:13,171
LIAM: -- let's stack the deck, all right? I'm
still gonna be live bait, because I have an

2110
01:39:13,245 --> 01:39:16,244
inkling that that thing, whatever it is, with the
tentacles on its face--

2111
01:39:16,244 --> 01:39:17,328
SAM: Is gonna see through that.

2112
01:39:17,328 --> 01:39:22,532
LIAM: -- is going to see through it. So if we've
got one real half-elf in the mix, he'll focus on me.

2113
01:39:22,532 --> 01:39:25,026
So I'll take the flying carpet and tie it around
my back.

2114
01:39:25,099 --> 01:39:26,502
LAURA: You better run fast and not get taken!

2115
01:39:26,502 --> 01:39:27,478
LIAM: I have boots of haste.

2116
01:39:27,478 --> 01:39:28,888
MARISHA: Are you good with hauling ass?

2117
01:39:28,888 --> 01:39:29,586
LIAM: Mm?

2118
01:39:29,586 --> 01:39:30,374
LAURA: (laughs)

2119
01:39:30,374 --> 01:39:31,352
MARISHA: Okay. As long as you can haul ass.

2120
01:39:31,352 --> 01:39:31,930
TRAVIS: All right.

2121
01:39:31,930 --> 01:39:32,666
LIAM: So I take the rug from Grog--

2122
01:39:32,666 --> 01:39:33,358
TRAVIS: Yep.

2123
01:39:33,358 --> 01:39:35,733
LIAM: I'm gonna roll it up and I tie it, I have a
rope to tie it to my back.

2124
01:39:35,733 --> 01:39:36,793
LAURA: It's a big rug on your back.

2125
01:39:36,793 --> 01:39:37,955
TRAVIS: Saddle up, let's do it.

2126
01:39:37,955 --> 01:39:39,305
MATT: It's a very big rug.

2127
01:39:39,305 --> 01:39:39,778
LIAM: Is it?

2128
01:39:39,778 --> 01:39:40,743
MATT: What's your strength?

2129
01:39:40,743 --> 01:39:42,200
LIAM: It is--

2130
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:43,263
LAURA: It's a big-ass rug.

2131
01:39:43,263 --> 01:39:43,902
SAM: Wait.

2132
01:39:43,902 --> 01:39:44,550
LIAM: 14?

2133
01:39:44,550 --> 01:39:45,647
LAURA: It'd be like carrying a--

2134
01:39:45,647 --> 01:39:47,713
MATT: It won't be cumbersome, necessarily.

2135
01:39:47,713 --> 01:39:50,381
MARISHA: Before Liam-- before Vax leaves--

2136
01:39:50,381 --> 01:39:53,807
SAM: Wait! Might I interject? I'm so sorry.

2137
01:39:53,807 --> 01:39:55,002
MARISHA: Go ahead.

2138
01:39:55,002 --> 01:39:59,384
SAM: You guys-- You and you will be hauling ass
away from the charging horde--

2139
01:39:59,384 --> 01:39:59,948
LAURA: You? You're not--

2140
01:39:59,948 --> 01:40:00,544
TRAVIS: No, no--

2141
01:40:00,544 --> 01:40:01,309
LAURA: No, just him.

2142
01:40:01,309 --> 01:40:02,630
TRAVIS: I'm staying on our side of the bridge.

2143
01:40:02,705 --> 01:40:03,969
SAM: On our side.

2144
01:40:03,969 --> 01:40:04,824
TRAVIS: Our side.

2145
01:40:04,824 --> 01:40:06,231
LAURA: But he's got a rug, he's got the flying
carpet.

2146
01:40:06,231 --> 01:40:07,611
TALIESIN: So we're gonna make them hallucinate--

2147
01:40:07,611 --> 01:40:10,546
SAM: So, when you get all the way to the other
side of the bridge, then we're gonna chop.

2148
01:40:10,546 --> 01:40:11,488
TRAVIS: No.

2149
01:40:11,488 --> 01:40:15,488
LAURA: No, we're gonna chop it when they start
coming across the bridge. We're hoping that

2150
01:40:15,488 --> 01:40:17,698
they're gonna just fall off the edge instead.

2151
01:40:17,698 --> 01:40:18,466
ORION: Run off the bridge--

2152
01:40:18,466 --> 01:40:19,571
TRAVIS: They go, (yells)

2153
01:40:19,571 --> 01:40:21,161
SAM: Which side are we gonna chop it on? Our side
or their side?

2154
01:40:21,161 --> 01:40:22,171
TRAVIS: Once he gets back to our side.

2155
01:40:22,171 --> 01:40:22,815
LAURA: Our side!

2156
01:40:22,815 --> 01:40:23,552
SAM: Okay.

2157
01:40:23,552 --> 01:40:25,919
TRAVIS: (yells) They come back, everybody falls
in--

2158
01:40:25,919 --> 01:40:27,388
LIAM: What's the bridge made of? Is it just rope
and wood?

2159
01:40:27,388 --> 01:40:28,167
SAM: Rope.

2160
01:40:28,167 --> 01:40:31,854
MATT: From what it looks like, it is rope and
stone platforms.

2161
01:40:31,854 --> 01:40:32,730
LAURA: Oh.

2162
01:40:32,730 --> 01:40:33,704
LIAM: On both sides?

2163
01:40:33,704 --> 01:40:35,779
MATT: Like slats, slats of stone, that then the
rope is tied around.

2164
01:40:35,779 --> 01:40:36,384
LAURA: Okay.

2165
01:40:36,384 --> 01:40:38,008
MATT: It's a very, very thick, hefty twine.

2166
01:40:38,008 --> 01:40:39,100
LAURA: He can cut through that.

2167
01:40:39,100 --> 01:40:41,137
TRAVIS: All right. So Tiberius and Vax are going
over.

2168
01:40:41,137 --> 01:40:41,975
LAURA: All right!

2169
01:40:41,975 --> 01:40:42,628
TRAVIS: Do it.

2170
01:40:42,628 --> 01:40:48,527
MARISHA: Before Vax leaves, I just put my hands on
his shoulders, and I cast Enhance Ability on him,

2171
01:40:48,527 --> 01:40:51,590
and give you a dexterity boost.

2172
01:40:51,590 --> 01:40:52,681
LIAM: Okay.

2173
01:40:52,681 --> 01:40:54,433
SAM: I'm also going to sing a little song--

2174
01:40:54,433 --> 01:40:55,722
MARISHA: So you have advantage on all dex rolls.

2175
01:40:55,722 --> 01:40:56,644
SAM: -- for both of them--

2176
01:40:56,644 --> 01:40:57,755
LIAM: So what's the boost? How high is it?

2177
01:40:57,755 --> 01:40:58,788
SAM: -- to inspire them.

2178
01:40:58,788 --> 01:40:59,542
MARISHA: You have the advantage--

2179
01:40:59,542 --> 01:41:00,107
LIAM: Advantage.

2180
01:41:00,107 --> 01:41:00,760
MARISHA: -- on all dex rolls.

2181
01:41:00,760 --> 01:41:01,670
LIAM: On all dex rolls. All right.

2182
01:41:01,670 --> 01:41:02,641
MARISHA: If that comes to that.

2183
01:41:02,641 --> 01:41:04,143
LIAM: That's great, because that's how I attack.

2184
01:41:04,143 --> 01:41:06,272
MATT: Well, advantage on dex ability checks.

2185
01:41:06,272 --> 01:41:06,826
LIAM: Okay.

2186
01:41:06,826 --> 01:41:07,521
MARISHA: Ability checks.

2187
01:41:07,521 --> 01:41:09,519
MATT: Like acrobatics, things like that, sleight
of hand, stealth.

2188
01:41:09,519 --> 01:41:10,330
LIAM: All right.

2189
01:41:10,330 --> 01:41:11,181
TRAVIS: Is Scanlan singing?

2190
01:41:11,181 --> 01:41:12,824
SAM: Oh, yes, I'll sing an inspiration song for
both of them.

2191
01:41:12,824 --> 01:41:13,515
MATT: Okay, so--

2192
01:41:13,515 --> 01:41:15,432
SAM: (sings) Hey baby, hey baby, hey!

2193
01:41:15,432 --> 01:41:15,998
LIAM: But we need to--

2194
01:41:15,998 --> 01:41:17,718
SAM: (sings) Dwarves say. Dwarves say.

2195
01:41:17,718 --> 01:41:18,482
(all laugh)

2196
01:41:18,482 --> 01:41:23,412
SAM: (sings) Hey baby, hey baby, hey! On to the
bridge and fall down.

2197
01:41:23,412 --> 01:41:26,812
(all laugh)

2198
01:41:26,812 --> 01:41:28,094
MATT: All right! So.

2199
01:41:28,094 --> 01:41:31,834
TRAVIS: Was that Gwen Stefani?

2200
01:41:31,834 --> 01:41:32,616
LAURA: All right! (laughs)

2201
01:41:32,616 --> 01:41:34,767
MATT: So, inspiration dice to Vax, and who else?

2202
01:41:34,767 --> 01:41:35,599
MARISHA: I hope this works.

2203
01:41:35,599 --> 01:41:37,834
MATT: Vax and who else? Gets inspiration dice?
Scanlan.

2204
01:41:37,834 --> 01:41:40,236
SAM: Oh, I'm sorry, these two-- Grog and Vax.

2205
01:41:40,236 --> 01:41:42,518
MATT: Okay. So both of you guys have a d8 of
inspiration dice you can spend.

2206
01:41:42,518 --> 01:41:43,393
SAM: Oh! Are you going too?

2207
01:41:43,393 --> 01:41:45,658
LAURA: Yeah, no, Grog isn't going, Tiberius is
going.

2208
01:41:45,658 --> 01:41:47,146
SAM: I'm sorry. Tiberius and Vax, then.

2209
01:41:47,146 --> 01:41:48,020
MATT: Okay. There you go.

2210
01:41:48,020 --> 01:41:49,218
TRAVIS: You could have gave it to me.

2211
01:41:49,218 --> 01:41:52,138
LIAM: But, Tiberius, walk on a bit behind me, and
I'm gonna walk up

2212
01:41:52,138 --> 01:41:54,677
to the edge of town, and I'm gonna chat.

2213
01:41:54,677 --> 01:41:55,439
MATT: Okay.

2214
01:41:55,439 --> 01:41:56,794
LAURA: Oh my god. What if you-- What!

2215
01:41:56,794 --> 01:41:58,592
MATT: So, before this happens, where's everyone
placed? You guys--

2216
01:41:58,592 --> 01:41:59,951
LIAM: Yeah, where are you guys--

2217
01:41:59,951 --> 01:42:00,792
LAURA: Oh my God.

2218
01:42:00,792 --> 01:42:01,973
MATT: You guys are across the bridge.

2219
01:42:01,973 --> 01:42:02,652
LAURA: Yes.

2220
01:42:02,652 --> 01:42:03,352
MATT: Where's the rest of you?

2221
01:42:03,352 --> 01:42:06,739
TALIESIN: I'm gonna set up on our side of the
bridge, I'm gonna set up the Bad News gun and get

2222
01:42:06,739 --> 01:42:09,570
ready to train it on whatever might try and come
across.

2223
01:42:09,570 --> 01:42:10,392
MATT: Okay.

2224
01:42:10,392 --> 01:42:14,050
LAURA: Are there any big rock formations that I
can sort of use as a shelter and kind of stay

2225
01:42:14,060 --> 01:42:16,260
behind that but also peek around?

2226
01:42:16,260 --> 01:42:21,341
MATT: About 20 feet off from the edge, on the
goblin side, there is one outcropping of, like, a

2227
01:42:21,399 --> 01:42:23,110
large stalagmite that you could probably get
behind.

2228
01:42:23,110 --> 01:42:24,226
LAURA: Oh, on the goblin side?

2229
01:42:24,226 --> 01:42:25,820
MATT: On the goblin side. Oh, do you wanna be on
their side?

2230
01:42:25,820 --> 01:42:27,820
LAURA: I want to be on our side.

2231
01:42:27,820 --> 01:42:31,807
MATT: Your side, meaning the side that the war
camp is on.

2232
01:42:31,807 --> 01:42:34,556
LAURA: No. I thought we were all on the other side
of the bridge.

2233
01:42:34,556 --> 01:42:36,909
SAM: We're gonna stay on the side that doesn't
have all the bad guys on it.

2234
01:42:36,909 --> 01:42:40,439
MATT: Right. There's the goblin side, which is
where you guys first went through, there's the

2235
01:42:40,498 --> 01:42:42,724
bridge, and then there's the war camp side.

2236
01:42:42,724 --> 01:42:44,070
LAURA and TRAVIS: Goblin side.

2237
01:42:44,070 --> 01:42:47,774
MATT: All right. So you're on-- Goblin side for
you, Goblin side for Grog--

2238
01:42:47,774 --> 01:42:48,543
TRAVIS: Yep.

2239
01:42:48,543 --> 01:42:51,302
MATT: Goblin side for Percy, setting up the Bad
News, your crazy gun.

2240
01:42:51,302 --> 01:42:52,217
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

2241
01:42:52,217 --> 01:42:53,279
LAURA: You're on the war camp side

2242
01:42:53,279 --> 01:42:54,097
TALIESIN: Gonna be great.

2243
01:42:54,097 --> 01:42:54,893
MATT: And Scanlan as well.

2244
01:42:54,893 --> 01:42:56,064
LIAM: Right, and I'm gonna run that, but you guys
are all going back to--

2245
01:42:56,064 --> 01:42:56,981
LAURA: We're on the goblin side.

2246
01:42:56,981 --> 01:42:58,916
LIAM: The safer side. The further side.

2247
01:42:58,969 --> 01:42:59,857
LAURA: Yeah.

2248
01:42:59,857 --> 01:43:02,964
MARISHA: I'm gonna be-- Can I be like halfway in
between on the bridge? Is that a bad idea?

2249
01:43:02,964 --> 01:43:04,011
MATT: You can do that. It's up to you.

2250
01:43:04,011 --> 01:43:05,297
TRAVIS: Go for it! You can fly.

2251
01:43:05,297 --> 01:43:06,979
LAURA: Can she fly?

2252
01:43:06,979 --> 01:43:07,901
MATT: Turn into birds.

2253
01:43:07,901 --> 01:43:08,802
MARISHA: I can turn into a bird.

2254
01:43:08,802 --> 01:43:09,501
MATT: She's a druid.

2255
01:43:09,501 --> 01:43:10,605
LAURA: Oh! You can turn into a bird!

2256
01:43:10,605 --> 01:43:11,246
TRAVIS: Yeah. She's fine.

2257
01:43:11,246 --> 01:43:12,897
LAURA: How long does your spell cast? I mean, your
spell last?

2258
01:43:12,897 --> 01:43:13,733
TRAVIS: (snickers)

2259
01:43:13,733 --> 01:43:14,625
LAURA: Shut up.

2260
01:43:14,625 --> 01:43:15,613
MARISHA: My-- which one?

2261
01:43:15,613 --> 01:43:16,968
LAURA: Your illusion spell.

2262
01:43:16,968 --> 01:43:20,041
MARISHA: It's a concentration thing. So, as long
as I can keep it up.

2263
01:43:20,041 --> 01:43:21,430
LAURA: So, maybe you should do that--

2264
01:43:21,430 --> 01:43:26,915
MARISHA: Oh. Yeah, for up to 30-- 24 hours,
actually. It's not a concentration spell.

2265
01:43:26,915 --> 01:43:29,502
LAURA: So, how far does it reach?

2266
01:43:29,502 --> 01:43:30,744
MARISHA: 300 feet.

2267
01:43:30,744 --> 01:43:31,594
LAURA: Okay.

2268
01:43:31,594 --> 01:43:34,168
MARISHA: 150 square feet.

2269
01:43:34,168 --> 01:43:35,352
MATT: Right. Okay.

2270
01:43:35,352 --> 01:43:36,224
LIAM: Just needs to--

2271
01:43:36,224 --> 01:43:37,007
MARISHA: And it looks, sounds--

2272
01:43:37,007 --> 01:43:38,074
LIAM: -- work around the edge of the bridge.

2273
01:43:38,074 --> 01:43:39,738
MARISHA: -- smells, like some other sort of
natural terrain.

2274
01:43:39,738 --> 01:43:41,853
MATT: So, what are you going to make the terrain
look like? What is your alteration?

2275
01:43:41,853 --> 01:43:47,085
MARISHA: So, what I'm doing, whenever we-- can I
make it look like

2276
01:43:47,085 --> 01:43:49,343
there's a cave-in happening through the tunnel?

2277
01:43:49,343 --> 01:43:52,773
LAURA: (whispers) Wait! No! Make it look like it's
really far--

2278
01:43:52,773 --> 01:43:54,281
LIAM: Keyleth, what if you fudged it so the
cliff--

2279
01:43:54,281 --> 01:43:55,324
MARISHA: Well, that's what I'm gonna do.

2280
01:43:55,324 --> 01:43:56,449
LIAM: -- looked like it went 30 feet further out.

2281
01:43:56,449 --> 01:43:58,956
MARISHA: Yeah. What I'm gonna do, I just want the
terrain to look, on my side--

2282
01:43:58,956 --> 01:43:59,859
LIAM: Close to what they're used to.

2283
01:43:59,859 --> 01:44:03,133
MARISHA: I want the terrain to look exactly like
what it is, but I just wanna stretch it out a

2284
01:44:03,133 --> 01:44:07,379
little bit, so it looks like they've got, like, an
extra running space.

2285
01:44:07,379 --> 01:44:08,240
MATT: Okay, okay.

2286
01:44:08,240 --> 01:44:09,266
LIAM: Yeah, so if it looks too different--

2287
01:44:09,266 --> 01:44:10,687
MATT: So like an additional 40 or so feet out from
the actual--

2288
01:44:10,687 --> 01:44:15,021
MARISHA: Yes. Of actual, yes. Like the bridge is
an extra 40 feet away.

2289
01:44:15,021 --> 01:44:18,522
MATT: Okay. The actual ceiling is maybe about 120
feet up, so it might be a little hard to do that,

2290
01:44:18,522 --> 01:44:19,998
and cause a cave-in-type illusion.

2291
01:44:19,998 --> 01:44:22,995
MARISHA: Okay. Then I'll do that. Then I'm gonna
just-- you know what, I'm gonna stay on the

2292
01:44:23,051 --> 01:44:25,401
opposite side of the bridge, and I'm gonna focus
on making that illusion.

2293
01:44:25,401 --> 01:44:28,910
MATT: Okay. Cool. So you go ahead and you cast
Hallucinatory Terrain--

2294
01:44:28,910 --> 01:44:29,718
MARISHA: Yep.

2295
01:44:29,718 --> 01:44:30,553
LAURA: (yells)

2296
01:44:30,553 --> 01:44:33,174
MATT: You now see an additional 40 feet of the
cliff stretching out--

2297
01:44:33,174 --> 01:44:34,211
LAURA: It looks very realistic.

2298
01:44:34,211 --> 01:44:34,972
MARISHA: Thank you!

2299
01:44:34,972 --> 01:44:37,085
MATT: And you can actually see that the bridge
looks attached to it, it's a very, very convincing

2300
01:44:37,085 --> 01:44:41,831
illusion. And you kind of have to remind yourself
that it's an illusion, just so you don't fall for

2301
01:44:41,831 --> 01:44:42,979
it either!

2302
01:44:42,979 --> 01:44:44,566
MARISHA: Yes, be careful guys, please be careful!

2303
01:44:44,566 --> 01:44:46,486
MATT: All right. So you're kind of chilling in the
middle of the bridge?

2304
01:44:46,486 --> 01:44:47,347
MARISHA: Mm-hm.

2305
01:44:47,347 --> 01:44:48,414
MATT: All right. The rest of you are--

2306
01:44:48,414 --> 01:44:49,612
MARISHA: All right, I'm on the outside of the
bridge.

2307
01:44:49,612 --> 01:44:50,782
MATT: -- on the other side-- outside of the
bridge.

2308
01:44:50,782 --> 01:44:51,845
MARISHA: I'm out with them.

2309
01:44:51,845 --> 01:44:52,827
MATT: Okay. So you're off the bridge now.

2310
01:44:52,827 --> 01:44:53,647
MARISHA: Gone. Yeah.

2311
01:44:53,647 --> 01:44:59,921
MATT: All right. So now, Tiberius, Vax, you guys
walk across the bridge, keeping grip both side

2312
01:44:59,921 --> 01:45:04,440
rails, feeling it rock to and fro from the
continuous warm bellowing of wind up from the

2313
01:45:04,440 --> 01:45:10,509
cavern beneath you. Eventually you bring your way
across. What looks like you should be stepping on

2314
01:45:10,509 --> 01:45:14,088
terrain is still the bridge, and it takes you a
minute to adjust to the fact that you're still

2315
01:45:14,088 --> 01:45:17,592
going across the bridge, but it looks like rocky
terrain. Eventually you make it to the other side

2316
01:45:17,592 --> 01:45:21,789
and you grab purchase on stone. Looking ahead of
you, you can see about 60 feet ahead of you the

2317
01:45:21,789 --> 01:45:24,787
outskirts of the war camp.

2318
01:45:24,787 --> 01:45:25,732
LIAM: Okay.

2319
01:45:25,732 --> 01:45:31,892
Tiberius, you wait here, ready to run. I
take Tiberius by the arm like this. Vox Machina.

2320
01:45:32,123 --> 01:45:34,059
ORION: Vox Machina.

2321
01:45:34,059 --> 01:45:35,233
(all laugh)

2322
01:45:35,233 --> 01:45:42,768
LIAM: Okay. So I stealthily walk up to the
closing distance to the edge of town and I stand

2323
01:45:42,839 --> 01:45:45,637
there. I click my boots of haste together.

2324
01:45:45,637 --> 01:45:46,514
LAURA: Oh god.

2325
01:45:46,514 --> 01:45:51,043
ORION: As he runs off I cast Greater Invisibility
on myself.

2326
01:45:51,043 --> 01:45:51,790
MATT: All right.

2327
01:45:51,790 --> 01:45:54,260
ORION: I cast Fly on myself and I hover.

2328
01:45:54,260 --> 01:45:57,234
MATT: Both of those are concentration spells.

2329
01:45:57,234 --> 01:45:58,238
ORION: Fuck!

2330
01:45:58,238 --> 01:46:01,081
MATT: You can only have one of those up at any
given point in time.

2331
01:46:01,081 --> 01:46:02,587
ORION: I'll cast Fly, then.

2332
01:46:02,587 --> 01:46:03,167
MATT: Okay.

2333
01:46:03,167 --> 01:46:03,932
ORION: Yes.

2334
01:46:03,932 --> 01:46:06,069
MATT: So you're now floating up. Okay.

2335
01:46:06,069 --> 01:46:07,197
LIAM: Okay.

2336
01:46:07,197 --> 01:46:11,033
ORION: And I'm at enough edge to where her
illusions are, as well.

2337
01:46:11,033 --> 01:46:12,398
MATT: Okay.

2338
01:46:12,398 --> 01:46:14,219
ORION: But over the bridge just in case I fall.

2339
01:46:14,219 --> 01:46:15,075
LAURA: (laughs)

2340
01:46:15,075 --> 01:46:17,628
MATT: Okay, all right. So you're now just kinda
hovering above the bridge now. You--

2341
01:46:17,628 --> 01:46:19,024
LIAM: I just clicked the boots.

2342
01:46:19,024 --> 01:46:21,874
MATT: You feel the sudden surge of magical energy
through your body like

2343
01:46:21,874 --> 01:46:24,032
adrenaline just pumping into your system.

2344
01:46:24,032 --> 01:46:31,736
LIAM: And I cry out full voice, listen up, you
walking prawn, doom has come for you today.

2345
01:46:31,736 --> 01:46:35,221
Step forth, you slimy bastard.

2346
01:46:35,221 --> 01:46:36,612
LAURA: Oh fuck.

2347
01:46:36,612 --> 01:46:37,339
(all laugh)

2348
01:46:37,339 --> 01:46:38,837
ORION: As he does that I toss out three cards.

2349
01:46:38,837 --> 01:46:39,612
MATT: All right.

2350
01:46:39,612 --> 01:46:40,600
LAURA: Oh gosh.

2351
01:46:40,600 --> 01:46:45,167
LIAM: Your trolls can't save you.

2352
01:46:45,167 --> 01:46:48,457
ORION: Right at the rim of where the illusion
stops.

2353
01:46:48,463 --> 01:46:50,068
LAURA: I will find you.

2354
01:46:50,068 --> 01:46:52,379
LIAM: No matter how far or how long.

2355
01:46:52,379 --> 01:46:55,577
MATT: Been awhile since you've used those. 
(laughs) All right. Oh, okay.

2356
01:46:55,577 --> 01:46:57,965
You shuffled these, right?

2357
01:46:57,965 --> 01:46:59,757
TRAVIS: We should call this a rim job.

2358
01:46:59,757 --> 01:47:00,564
ORION: Yes.

2359
01:47:00,564 --> 01:47:02,728
MATT: All right. This will be very, very
interesting.

2360
01:47:02,808 --> 01:47:03,571
LIAM: Oh Jesus.

2361
01:47:03,571 --> 01:47:05,176
LAURA: Oh god.

2362
01:47:05,176 --> 01:47:07,120
TALIESIN: This is a good plan.

2363
01:47:07,120 --> 01:47:07,943
SAM: You got your dice?

2364
01:47:07,943 --> 01:47:08,775
TRAVIS: Sure it is.

2365
01:47:08,775 --> 01:47:09,539
LIAM: It's a great plan.

2366
01:47:09,539 --> 01:47:10,297
SAM: Use your dice.

2367
01:47:10,297 --> 01:47:11,265
MARISHA: Are you convincing yourself or are you--

2368
01:47:11,265 --> 01:47:12,328
TALIESIN: This is a good plan.

2369
01:47:12,328 --> 01:47:13,883
TRAVIS: We're on the safe side with Bad News and
me.

2370
01:47:13,883 --> 01:47:15,000
TALIESIN: We're fine.

2371
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,152
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm with you guys. We're fine.

2372
01:47:17,152 --> 01:47:25,326
MATT: So currently one of the cards bursts and you
can see rising up from its energy this

2373
01:47:25,557 --> 01:47:32,834
awful-looking humanoid skeletal undead creature
with long golden red robes, with this gnarled gold

2374
01:47:32,834 --> 01:47:36,992
crown and these glowing blue eyes and just pure
arcane energy

2375
01:47:36,992 --> 01:47:40,934
across this horribly gnarled skeletal face.

2376
01:47:40,934 --> 01:47:41,728
TRAVIS: Okay.

2377
01:47:41,728 --> 01:47:45,558
MATT: There stands this hideous-looking lich
cackling to itself.

2378
01:47:45,558 --> 01:47:53,076
ORION: Ah, the ace of spades-- two of spades, it
changed, dammit. Looking at Pathfinder right now.

2379
01:47:53,076 --> 01:47:54,248
(all laugh)

2380
01:47:54,248 --> 01:47:57,460
ORION: Two of spades.

2381
01:47:57,460 --> 01:47:59,355
LIAM: Tiberius, can we hit it and quit it?

2382
01:47:59,355 --> 01:48:02,251
LAURA: What are the other ones?

2383
01:48:02,251 --> 01:48:05,464
MATT: The other one (poof) and you see before you
a kind of --

2384
01:48:05,464 --> 01:48:09,349
ORION: Flip them over, they have good graphics on
the cover.

2385
01:48:09,349 --> 01:48:17,291
MATT: It's nice. Through the smoke, you see what
looks like some sort of a human kind of long,

2386
01:48:17,291 --> 01:48:23,310
long-fighting warrior, grizzled, ready to fight,
has a big old longsword out, armored up in

2387
01:48:23,310 --> 01:48:28,676
scalemail, one eye is kinda wounded, and he just
kinda sits there and growls with his blade ready.

2388
01:48:28,676 --> 01:48:37,569
The third card. From the smoke appears a
red-skinned dragonborn with long blue robes and a

2389
01:48:37,569 --> 01:48:38,961
staff with a glowing beam of light on it.

2390
01:48:38,961 --> 01:48:39,950
TRAVIS: Yes.

2391
01:48:39,950 --> 01:48:41,678
ORION: Oh. It must be a joker.

2392
01:48:41,678 --> 01:48:45,862
MATT: You see an exact duplicate of Tiberius now
standing there as the three illusions stand.

2393
01:48:45,862 --> 01:48:47,614
(all laugh)

2394
01:48:47,614 --> 01:48:48,547
TRAVIS: Outstanding.

2395
01:48:48,547 --> 01:48:49,312
MARISHA: That's perfect.

2396
01:48:49,312 --> 01:48:50,678
MATT: Your cards are now spent, correct?

2397
01:48:50,678 --> 01:48:53,499
ORION: Uh, no, they exist until I dispel them.

2398
01:48:53,499 --> 01:48:55,963
MATT: Right, but I mean the actual cards don't go
back in the deck.

2399
01:48:55,963 --> 01:48:56,684
ORION: Yes, they do.

2400
01:48:56,684 --> 01:49:03,879
MATT: They do, okay. All right, never mind. Okay.
As you shout out, the card illusion appears. You

2401
01:49:03,879 --> 01:49:12,757
see about five or six duergar kind of look out
from a nearby tent and go-- and then start running

2402
01:49:12,757 --> 01:49:15,351
toward the center of the town.

2403
01:49:15,351 --> 01:49:16,905
MARISHA: Come here, bitches

2404
01:49:16,905 --> 01:49:23,955
MATT: About 20 seconds pass. And then you start
hearing this (boom boom boom boom). It sounds like

2405
01:49:23,955 --> 01:49:24,897
a drum beat.

2406
01:49:24,897 --> 01:49:25,988
LAURA: Oh my god.

2407
01:49:25,988 --> 01:49:26,875
SAM: Cut the rope, cut the rope.

2408
01:49:26,875 --> 01:49:28,294
LAURA: Not yet, not yet, not yet.

2409
01:49:28,294 --> 01:49:29,937
SAM: Leave Vax there, let's go.

2410
01:49:29,937 --> 01:49:31,284
(all laugh)

2411
01:49:31,284 --> 01:49:37,939
MATT: At this point, you now see about 16 duergar
come running out from the center of town, armored,

2412
01:49:37,939 --> 01:49:45,372
weapons drawn, a few with crossbows, two trolls
and an ogre charging out. You see the ogres

2413
01:49:45,372 --> 01:49:50,271
holding this giant-- it looks like a stone slab
for one of its clubs, and the two trolls just come

2414
01:49:50,271 --> 01:49:53,671
with their claws open, rushing right towards you
and the illusions.

2415
01:49:53,671 --> 01:49:54,748
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

2416
01:49:54,748 --> 01:49:56,758
LIAM: I start flipping--

2417
01:49:56,758 --> 01:50:02,043
ORION: I command the lich to start doing one of
his glowy spells, and, like, through him, I go:

2418
01:50:02,043 --> 01:50:05,109
(whispers) Come for us, your death awaits.

2419
01:50:05,109 --> 01:50:06,461
(all laugh)

2420
01:50:06,461 --> 01:50:07,348
MATT: All right.

2421
01:50:07,348 --> 01:50:10,069
LIAM: And I flip the double birds and start
walking backwards a little bit.

2422
01:50:10,069 --> 01:50:11,509
SAM: Oh yes, that's even better!

2423
01:50:11,509 --> 01:50:12,614
MARISHA: Just watch your step!

2424
01:50:12,614 --> 01:50:13,799
LIAM: Yes, straight back.

2425
01:50:13,799 --> 01:50:14,972
ORION: I command the soldier to start swinging his
sword.

2426
01:50:14,972 --> 01:50:19,091
MATT: As you're stepping back, four of the duergar
immediately take, using their inertia,

2427
01:50:19,091 --> 01:50:21,446
pull and release javelins in your direction.

2428
01:50:21,446 --> 01:50:22,215
LIAM: Okay.

2429
01:50:22,215 --> 01:50:27,642
LAURA: Oh god!

2430
01:50:27,642 --> 01:50:29,646
MATT: All right, what's your AC?

2431
01:50:29,646 --> 01:50:30,537
LAURA: Oh gosh.

2432
01:50:30,537 --> 01:50:33,080
LIAM: My AC is 19.

2433
01:50:33,080 --> 01:50:35,425
MATT: All right, you take two javelins--

2434
01:50:35,425 --> 01:50:38,271
LIAM: I'm gonna use Uncanny Dodge. For anything I
can see, I can dodge

2435
01:50:38,271 --> 01:50:40,107
for half damage, if I need to.

2436
01:50:40,107 --> 01:50:42,633
MATT: All right, good to know. The first one
strikes

2437
01:50:42,633 --> 01:50:47,364
you in the torso for a total of 11 damage.

2438
01:50:47,364 --> 01:50:49,051
LIAM: Shit, okay.

2439
01:50:49,051 --> 01:50:50,066
ORION: Oh.

2440
01:50:50,066 --> 01:50:53,287
MATT: The other hits you for a total of eight
damage.

2441
01:50:53,287 --> 01:50:54,936
LIAM: Is that the halved or--?

2442
01:50:54,936 --> 01:50:55,816
ORION: Total.

2443
01:50:55,816 --> 01:50:57,757
MATT: No, well, you can choose to half one. It's
up to you, you choose which one.

2444
01:50:57,757 --> 01:50:58,516
Probably the higher one.

2445
01:50:58,516 --> 01:50:59,492
LIAM: Okay, so, it was 11 and eight?

2446
01:50:59,492 --> 01:51:00,354
MATT: So it would be six.

2447
01:51:00,354 --> 01:51:01,746
LIAM: Okay, six and eight, okay, 14.

2448
01:51:01,746 --> 01:51:04,172
MATT: 14 points of damage with these just javelins
hitting you like, oh, that's right.

2449
01:51:04,172 --> 01:51:05,536
They have range!

2450
01:51:05,536 --> 01:51:06,920
(all laugh)

2451
01:51:06,920 --> 01:51:08,978
LIAM: Right, I knew this was coming.

2452
01:51:08,978 --> 01:51:09,690
LAURA: Right!

2453
01:51:09,690 --> 01:51:11,359
MATT: You can immediately see one of the trolls
goes and just lunges forward and slashes the lich,

2454
01:51:11,359 --> 01:51:12,808
just passing through its form.

2455
01:51:12,808 --> 01:51:13,654
ORION: He lunges at the lich?

2456
01:51:13,654 --> 01:51:14,382
MATT: Yeah.

2457
01:51:14,382 --> 01:51:16,045
ORION: Sweet!

2458
01:51:16,045 --> 01:51:19,505
MATT: It went through, it kinda loses its footing
for a second, stops and kinda looks angry,

2459
01:51:19,505 --> 01:51:20,860
turns and starts slashing at it again.

2460
01:51:20,860 --> 01:51:21,880
LAURA: Run! Run away!

2461
01:51:21,880 --> 01:51:22,752
SAM: -- fake ground.

2462
01:51:22,752 --> 01:51:23,735
ORION: And I'm like--

2463
01:51:23,735 --> 01:51:24,988
MARISHA: Yeah, isn't he on the fake ground? The
lich?

2464
01:51:24,988 --> 01:51:25,855
ORION: Yes, yeah, he's like right at the edge.

2465
01:51:25,855 --> 01:51:26,851
MATT: Yeah, right at the precipice.

2466
01:51:26,851 --> 01:51:29,232
ORION: I can't throw my card on the fake ground.
They'd fall.

2467
01:51:29,232 --> 01:51:30,870
MATT: Yeah, so the troll kind of steps forward--

2468
01:51:30,870 --> 01:51:32,387
ORION: They're right at the edge, though.

2469
01:51:32,387 --> 01:51:35,107
MATT: -- and the troll turns around and starts
slashing. The other one goes right for the

2470
01:51:35,107 --> 01:51:40,528
veteran. And (laughs) goes running right off the
edge.

2471
01:51:40,528 --> 01:51:41,463
LAURA: (gasps)

2472
01:51:41,463 --> 01:51:42,489
ALL: Yes!

2473
01:51:42,489 --> 01:51:43,319
SAM: The troll?

2474
01:51:43,319 --> 01:51:47,513
MATT: That was the troll, just (falling sounds).
The ogre goes running forward, right towards you.

2475
01:51:47,513 --> 01:51:48,359
ORION: I command the--

2476
01:51:48,359 --> 01:51:49,289
LIAM: Yes?

2477
01:51:49,289 --> 01:51:52,053
MATT: Just their speed, they're just the first
ones to get there. Duergar have tiny legs.

2478
01:51:52,053 --> 01:51:54,982
LIAM: (high-pitched voice) Where's the roll for
initiative, man?

2479
01:51:54,982 --> 01:51:56,150
LAURA: You're already back, you're at the bridge!

2480
01:51:56,150 --> 01:51:58,054
MATT: This is what I'm saying, what are you doing?
This is your reactionary part. We're just taking--

2481
01:51:58,054 --> 01:51:59,437
this isn't a battle, this is--

2482
01:51:59,437 --> 01:52:01,762
LIAM: Yeah, I'm backing it up, I'm running, man.

2483
01:52:01,762 --> 01:52:08,960
MATT: All right, so you go charging back onto the
bridge. As you go running, all right, both trolls

2484
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:10,865
and the ogre have just gone off the side.

2485
01:52:10,865 --> 01:52:11,705
LAURA: Badass!

2486
01:52:11,705 --> 01:52:12,989
(all cheer)

2487
01:52:12,989 --> 01:52:14,728
MATT: You hear them screaming as they tumble into
the darkness.

2488
01:52:14,728 --> 01:52:16,609
LIAM: I'm laughing as I run.

2489
01:52:16,609 --> 01:52:18,238
TRAVIS: Didn't occur to me that there is a
bridge--

2490
01:52:18,238 --> 01:52:24,025
MATT: About four duergar also go spilling over the
side, screaming as they tumble into the darkness.

2491
01:52:24,025 --> 01:52:24,963
TRAVIS: Yes!

2492
01:52:24,963 --> 01:52:26,634
MATT: The rest of them stop, kind of look around
and--

2493
01:52:26,634 --> 01:52:27,926
SAM: This was a great plan!

2494
01:52:27,926 --> 01:52:32,212
ORION: I start-- as that's happening, I start to
pull back and float away and I'm commanding all of

2495
01:52:32,212 --> 01:52:35,573
my guys to come through the bridge. Because I can
command them within 30 feet. So they're now,

2496
01:52:35,573 --> 01:52:38,343
they're all within 30 feet of me, retreating as
well.

2497
01:52:38,343 --> 01:52:43,516
MATT: Okay. As this is happening, you can now see
some of the members of the duergar that are now at

2498
01:52:43,516 --> 01:52:48,580
the edge are some of the elite guard, with the
blackened armor you saw. They both kinda step

2499
01:52:48,580 --> 01:52:53,885
forward and put their foot out, feeling for
purchase, give a nod, pull out their swords, and

2500
01:52:53,885 --> 01:52:55,367
start hacking at the bridge immediately.

2501
01:52:55,367 --> 01:52:56,494
SAM: (gasps) Oh shit.

2502
01:52:56,494 --> 01:52:57,534
LAURA: Shit.

2503
01:52:57,534 --> 01:52:58,751
TALIESIN: All right, I'm taking a shot.

2504
01:52:58,751 --> 01:53:01,263
LAURA: Can we-- does our aim reach? Our ranged
attacks, do they reach?

2505
01:53:01,263 --> 01:53:02,319
SAM: (whispers) You, fly?

2506
01:53:02,319 --> 01:53:03,417
TRAVIS: No, he's got it.

2507
01:53:03,417 --> 01:53:05,470
LAURA: Do ranged attacks reach?

2508
01:53:05,491 --> 01:53:08,111
MATT: From this distance, it's gonna be a serious
penalty.

2509
01:53:08,111 --> 01:53:08,781
TALIESIN: I'm not!

2510
01:53:08,781 --> 01:53:09,709
MATT: You don't, because you--

2511
01:53:09,709 --> 01:53:11,781
TALIESIN: I'm taking that shot, because I can
shoot forever.

2512
01:53:11,781 --> 01:53:12,917
MATT: Go for it.

2513
01:53:12,917 --> 01:53:14,311
ORION: (gunshot)

2514
01:53:14,311 --> 01:53:15,864
LIAM: I'm untying the carpet quickly.

2515
01:53:15,864 --> 01:53:17,448
(all laugh)

2516
01:53:17,448 --> 01:53:20,752
TALIESIN: Oh, for the love of god and all that is
holy.

2517
01:53:20,752 --> 01:53:21,969
MARISHA: (groans) Oh, no.

2518
01:53:21,969 --> 01:53:24,097
TALIESIN: Misfire, I gotta--

2519
01:53:24,097 --> 01:53:25,487
LAURA: I can at least try, right?

2520
01:53:25,487 --> 01:53:28,211
MATT: Go ahead and roll. As you-- You're at
disadvantage.

2521
01:53:28,211 --> 01:53:31,685
LAURA: Fail so hard.

2522
01:53:31,685 --> 01:53:35,769
MATT: As your arrow (shooting sound) off, you (gun
misfiring sound) and there's a slight delay, and

2523
01:53:35,769 --> 01:53:40,667
you wonder, why isn't it working? And this
horrible explosion sound bursts out as you can now

2524
01:53:40,667 --> 01:53:44,397
see, black and red smoke pouring out of the front
of the barrel of Bad News, and it burns your hands

2525
01:53:44,397 --> 01:53:46,365
for a second and you're like, ah, shit, take a
second to--

2526
01:53:46,365 --> 01:53:47,792
TALIESIN: All right, so I gotta stop and clean.

2527
01:53:47,792 --> 01:53:50,963
MATT: Yeah, however, because you are unable to
halt that,

2528
01:53:50,963 --> 01:53:54,058
both of those duergar take shots at the bridge.

2529
01:53:54,058 --> 01:53:56,148
TALIESIN: Damn it.

2530
01:53:56,219 --> 01:53:58,120
MATT: Both hit with their swords.

2531
01:53:58,120 --> 01:53:59,541
MARISHA: Are you on the carpet, Vax?

2532
01:53:59,541 --> 01:54:00,590
TRAVIS: He's getting it out.

2533
01:54:00,590 --> 01:54:01,507
LIAM: I don't know, I said I was.

2534
01:54:01,507 --> 01:54:02,812
LAURA: Get on it, now.

2535
01:54:02,881 --> 01:54:03,936
MATT: As you're running and pulling the carpet
out--

2536
01:54:03,936 --> 01:54:04,682
LIAM: Yes!

2537
01:54:04,682 --> 01:54:05,888
MATT: -- the bridge is cut clean--

2538
01:54:05,888 --> 01:54:06,567
LAURA: (gasps)

2539
01:54:06,567 --> 01:54:07,294
MARISHA: Son of a bitch.

2540
01:54:07,294 --> 01:54:08,569
MATT: -- and begins to fall out from under you.

2541
01:54:08,569 --> 01:54:09,349
LIAM: Okay.

2542
01:54:09,349 --> 01:54:10,442
MATT: You go pulling out the--

2543
01:54:10,442 --> 01:54:11,260
LIAM: Acrobatics check?

2544
01:54:11,260 --> 01:54:12,321
MARISHA: Use them dex saves!

2545
01:54:12,321 --> 01:54:13,664
MATT: This is gonna go ahead and be a dex check
now.

2546
01:54:13,664 --> 01:54:14,831
MARISHA: You've got advantage!

2547
01:54:14,831 --> 01:54:15,508
MATT: You do.

2548
01:54:15,508 --> 01:54:16,241
LAURA: Oh, good.

2549
01:54:16,241 --> 01:54:19,533
LIAM: Okay, good, because the first roll was a
one. The second roll was a 19.

2550
01:54:19,533 --> 01:54:20,867
ORION: Yes!

2551
01:54:20,867 --> 01:54:23,422
LIAM: Plus! Plus, plus, plus nine is 28.

2552
01:54:23,422 --> 01:54:27,433
TRAVIS: Oh my god! You almost died!

2553
01:54:27,433 --> 01:54:33,465
MATT: All right. You pull out the carpet. As
you're going to set it down, as you feel the

2554
01:54:33,465 --> 01:54:37,497
bridge beginning to like, give out from under you,
you feel this creepy sensation

2555
01:54:37,497 --> 01:54:38,984
pushing towards the back of your head.

2556
01:54:38,984 --> 01:54:39,789
LAURA: Oh no!

2557
01:54:39,789 --> 01:54:40,705
LIAM: Mm-hm.

2558
01:54:40,705 --> 01:54:44,044
MATT: You guys, looking across, you can see now a
familiar cloaked figure has emerged.

2559
01:54:44,044 --> 01:54:45,274
(all gasp)

2560
01:54:45,274 --> 01:54:46,161
SAM: Oh shit!

2561
01:54:46,161 --> 01:54:46,916
LIAM: I drew him out.

2562
01:54:46,916 --> 01:54:47,885
LAURA: Clean your gun, clean your gun!

2563
01:54:47,885 --> 01:54:48,745
TALIESIN: I'm cleaning my gun.

2564
01:54:48,745 --> 01:54:50,295
MATT: Go ahead and make a willpower saving throw.

2565
01:54:50,295 --> 01:54:51,273
TRAVIS: Get your bow ready.

2566
01:54:51,273 --> 01:54:52,544
LAURA: I am, I'm ready, it's too far!

2567
01:54:52,544 --> 01:54:55,914
LIAM: I survive a free fall and you hit me with
that right after? Yeah, will save?

2568
01:54:55,914 --> 01:54:56,958
MATT: Willpower save.

2569
01:54:56,958 --> 01:54:59,171
LIAM: So that's-- what is it, I've never done
that? That's--

2570
01:54:59,171 --> 01:55:04,041
MATT: It's at the top of your sheet of your stats,
above your stats, on the right of your stats. Oh,

2571
01:55:04,041 --> 01:55:06,357
it's your wisdom saving.

2572
01:55:06,357 --> 01:55:07,695
LIAM: Wisdom, okay.

2573
01:55:07,695 --> 01:55:08,624
MATT: Wisdom.

2574
01:55:08,624 --> 01:55:12,185
LIAM: Ow, not very good. Seven.

2575
01:55:12,185 --> 01:55:13,062
MATT: Seven.

2576
01:55:13,062 --> 01:55:14,839
LAURA: No!

2577
01:55:14,839 --> 01:55:24,844
MATT: As you are running, you get the carpet out,
you leap onto it and your whole sense and awareness

2578
01:55:24,979 --> 01:55:27,538
of your surroundings just fades from you. You just
feel your entire body going numb for a second and

2579
01:55:27,604 --> 01:55:30,579
you just feel yourself falling.

2580
01:55:30,579 --> 01:55:31,894
MARISHA: Holy shit.

2581
01:55:31,894 --> 01:55:32,929
LAURA: Fly down! Get him! Get him!

2582
01:55:32,929 --> 01:55:33,947
MATT: Falling back.

2583
01:55:33,947 --> 01:55:35,132
ORION: Oh! Oh bother! Shoo! I go get him!

2584
01:55:35,132 --> 01:55:37,791
LIAM: 29 dex save right down the toilet.

2585
01:55:37,791 --> 01:55:39,624
MATT: You go and swoop down, fly. You manage to--

2586
01:55:39,624 --> 01:55:40,883
ORION: Is he conscious?

2587
01:55:40,883 --> 01:55:43,280
MATT: He is just staring up at this moment.

2588
01:55:43,280 --> 01:55:46,778
ORION: Very good. I go just to touch him, I am not
trying to pull him up.

2589
01:55:46,778 --> 01:55:48,099
MATT: Okay.

2590
01:55:48,192 --> 01:55:49,344
LAURA: What? Try to grab him! Try to grab him!

2591
01:55:49,344 --> 01:55:50,294
LIAM: Fly, he can fly me.

2592
01:55:50,294 --> 01:55:51,063
SAM : He is falling!

2593
01:55:51,063 --> 01:55:51,861
ORION: He is falling. Fly!

2594
01:55:51,861 --> 01:55:52,734
LIAM: Like Superman.

2595
01:55:52,734 --> 01:55:53,806
MATT: You cast Fly on him? All right!

2596
01:55:53,806 --> 01:55:55,155
ORION: Now fly, damn it.

2597
01:55:55,155 --> 01:55:59,735
MATT: He is still just kind of standing there, not
doing anything. As you finish casting the Fly

2598
01:55:59,735 --> 01:56:02,678
spell, your Fly spell dissipates because it's a
concentration spell

2599
01:56:02,678 --> 01:56:04,459
and you can have one at a given time.

2600
01:56:04,459 --> 01:56:05,928
ORION: Wait, you're unconscious?

2601
01:56:05,928 --> 01:56:07,002
LIAM: I don't know what I am.

2602
01:56:07,002 --> 01:56:07,880
ORION: I ask right now, is he--

2603
01:56:07,880 --> 01:56:08,997
MARISHA: He's like catatonic.

2604
01:56:08,997 --> 01:56:11,716
ORION: He is, okay. Then I don't do that, because
you can't fly yourself,

2605
01:56:11,716 --> 01:56:15,164
so I do grab him, this time.

2606
01:56:15,221 --> 01:56:19,940
MATT: Okay, you grab him as his whole weight goes
onto you. What's your strength?

2607
01:56:19,997 --> 01:56:21,837
ORION: Oh my god.

2608
01:56:21,837 --> 01:56:22,928
LIAM: It has been nice knowing you, ladies and
gentlemen.

2609
01:56:22,928 --> 01:56:23,727
ORION: 12.

2610
01:56:23,727 --> 01:56:24,704
LAURA: No, no, no.

2611
01:56:24,704 --> 01:56:28,019
MATT: Go ahead and make an athletics check.

2612
01:56:28,019 --> 01:56:29,747
MARISHA: Come on, Tiberius.

2613
01:56:29,747 --> 01:56:31,584
LAURA: Can we see this all happening off to the
side?

2614
01:56:31,584 --> 01:56:33,495
SAM: Plus eight.

2615
01:56:33,495 --> 01:56:34,324
LAURA: Keyleth!

2616
01:56:34,324 --> 01:56:35,211
TALIESIN: It's happening very fast.

2617
01:56:35,211 --> 01:56:36,138
LIAM: Oh, shit, can I use--

2618
01:56:36,138 --> 01:56:40,149
ORION: It's a 21.

2619
01:56:40,149 --> 01:56:47,918
MATT: 21? You rush down, diving, you grab the back
of his armor. As you yank up on him, you manage to

2620
01:56:47,918 --> 01:56:53,187
just pull him across and get him to the other
edge. The flying carpet, however, has plummeted

2621
01:56:53,187 --> 01:56:54,153
down in--

2622
01:56:54,153 --> 01:56:55,610
ALL: No!

2623
01:56:55,610 --> 01:56:56,740
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch.

2624
01:56:56,740 --> 01:56:59,595
LAURA: You lost our flying carpet, you
unconscious bastard!

2625
01:56:59,595 --> 01:57:05,886
MATT: However, Tiberius swoops up. You guys just
see them both plummet into darkness and then

2626
01:57:05,886 --> 01:57:10,979
flying up at the edge of the crevasse on your
side, Tiberius clutching your brother, currently

2627
01:57:10,979 --> 01:57:13,892
just staring off into space and dropping him down
with a dull sound.

2628
01:57:13,892 --> 01:57:15,858
LAURA: Vax!

2629
01:57:15,858 --> 01:57:19,290
MATT: The bridge slaps onto the side of the
cavern.

2630
01:57:19,350 --> 01:57:20,761
LIAM: Mawp.

2631
01:57:20,761 --> 01:57:22,648
LAURA: And I run over to Vax.

2632
01:57:22,648 --> 01:57:23,390
LIAM: Mawp.

2633
01:57:23,390 --> 01:57:25,832
LAURA: And I'm like trying to figure out what's
wrong with him.

2634
01:57:25,832 --> 01:57:27,417
TRAVIS: The magic carpet is done?

2635
01:57:27,417 --> 01:57:28,836
MATT: It just disappeared into the darkness
below.

2636
01:57:28,909 --> 01:57:29,932
LAURA: Oh no!

2637
01:57:29,932 --> 01:57:32,278
TRAVIS: (tearfully) I have to erase it.

2638
01:57:32,278 --> 01:57:33,038
MARISHA: Bye, carpet.

2639
01:57:33,038 --> 01:57:33,940
TALIESIN: No.

2640
01:57:33,940 --> 01:57:35,185
SAM: That was our ticket across the chasm.

2641
01:57:35,242 --> 01:57:36,076
LIAM: Yes.

2642
01:57:36,076 --> 01:57:39,199
MARISHA: I loved that carpet, damn it.

2643
01:57:39,199 --> 01:57:41,818
MATT: About a minute passes or so, you come back
to your senses.

2644
01:57:41,818 --> 01:57:43,635
LAURA: Oh, good.

2645
01:57:43,635 --> 01:57:45,801
LIAM: I got to get the carpet.

2646
01:57:45,801 --> 01:57:47,364
(all laugh)

2647
01:57:47,364 --> 01:57:48,476
TALIESIN: Can I clean my gun?

2648
01:57:48,476 --> 01:57:49,858
ORION: I slap him with Mage Hand. Snap out of
it!

2649
01:57:49,858 --> 01:57:51,020
LIAM: What happened? What happened?

2650
01:57:51,020 --> 01:57:51,957
TRAVIS: Wait, do we leave or--

2651
01:57:51,957 --> 01:57:52,949
LAURA: No, wait--

2652
01:57:52,949 --> 01:57:54,671
TALIESIN: They are still across there, aren't
they?

2653
01:57:54,671 --> 01:57:57,826
MATT: You can see across the way that there are a
bunch of them just standing at the edge.

2654
01:57:57,826 --> 01:57:59,684
TALIESIN: I wanna take a shot at the--

2655
01:57:59,684 --> 01:58:00,680
LAURA: At the--

2656
01:58:00,680 --> 01:58:02,419
LIAM: Noodle-face, yeah.

2657
01:58:02,479 --> 01:58:04,712
MATT: Okay, go for it.

2658
01:58:04,712 --> 01:58:06,231
LAURA: Oh, man!

2659
01:58:06,231 --> 01:58:08,292
SAM: You can see them and they control you.

2660
01:58:08,292 --> 01:58:09,274
LAURA: Right in the noggin.

2661
01:58:09,274 --> 01:58:10,224
LIAM: Shoot it in the eye, man.

2662
01:58:10,224 --> 01:58:14,086
ORION: Not from that distance, I don't think. His
sniper rifle goes far.

2663
01:58:14,086 --> 01:58:16,029
TALIESIN: Hm, that's a 23.

2664
01:58:16,029 --> 01:58:28,607
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll the damage. Across
the way you can hear the resounding (gunshot).

2665
01:58:28,607 --> 01:58:33,418
TALIESIN: Ah, yeah! That don't suck! 20 points of
damage.

2666
01:58:33,418 --> 01:58:42,896
MATT: 20 points of damage! Nice. You just see
this blast of red and flame across the way and

2667
01:58:42,896 --> 01:58:45,608
the figure is just knocked off its feet, about ten
feet back.

2668
01:58:45,841 --> 01:58:51,018
(all laugh)

2669
01:58:51,018 --> 01:58:52,455
LAURA: Can you shoot him again?

2670
01:58:52,455 --> 01:58:54,138
TALIESIN: Yes.

2671
01:58:54,138 --> 01:58:56,680
MARISHA: It's just a carnival game for Percy at
this point.

2672
01:58:56,680 --> 01:58:59,051
MATT: At this point in time you can now see the
duergar looking up

2673
01:58:59,051 --> 01:59:01,567
and backing away from the cliff side.

2674
01:59:01,567 --> 01:59:03,721
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2675
01:59:03,721 --> 01:59:06,638
MATT: You come to the bridge, which is just
dangling off the side now.

2676
01:59:06,638 --> 01:59:09,125
LIAM: We're on the goblin side, now?

2677
01:59:09,125 --> 01:59:10,143
LAURA: Yeah.

2678
01:59:10,143 --> 01:59:11,751
MATT: You're on the goblin side and the bridge is
just dangling down into darkness.

2679
01:59:11,751 --> 01:59:13,170
TALIESIN: That felt pretty good, too.

2680
01:59:13,170 --> 01:59:17,809
LIAM: Who wants to have a picnic?

2681
01:59:17,809 --> 01:59:19,579
ORION: I mean, seriously.

2682
01:59:19,579 --> 01:59:21,219
MARISHA: So how many (monster sounds) are over
there ?

2683
01:59:21,292 --> 01:59:22,597
MATT: You only saw the one.

2684
01:59:22,597 --> 01:59:24,657
MARISHA: And how many duergar left? How many--

2685
01:59:24,657 --> 01:59:25,884
ORION: Yes, how many are left after all that?

2686
01:59:25,884 --> 01:59:26,807
MARISHA: After they fell into--

2687
01:59:26,807 --> 01:59:30,303
MATT: After all that, you saw a few more kind of
filter out from the town, you have probably about

2688
01:59:30,303 --> 01:59:33,358
25 visible at that moment that have all backed.

2689
01:59:33,358 --> 01:59:37,279
TALIESIN: I'm going to hang on him visually and
I'm gonna wait to take another shot

2690
01:59:37,279 --> 01:59:39,358
until he tries to stand up again.

2691
01:59:39,358 --> 01:59:40,271
MATT: Okay.

2692
01:59:40,271 --> 01:59:43,089
TALIESIN: So if he tries to stand up again, I want
to shoot him again.

2693
01:59:43,089 --> 01:59:45,691
LAURA: But wait, you can shoot him while he's on
the ground! Can't you?

2694
01:59:45,691 --> 01:59:47,942
TALIESIN: That's so much more fun to wait.

2695
01:59:47,942 --> 01:59:50,035
MATT: You can shoot him, but it's at disadvantage
to shoot someone who's prone.

2696
01:59:50,035 --> 01:59:50,776
LAURA: He's on the ground?

2697
01:59:50,776 --> 01:59:51,717
MATT: Yeah.

2698
01:59:51,717 --> 01:59:54,228
TALIESIN: Technically, he's got cover. And it's
funnier to just wait.

2699
01:59:54,228 --> 01:59:57,165
MATT: A moment passes and he kind of drifts back
up. Take another shot.

2700
01:59:57,165 --> 01:59:58,441
TALIESIN: Taking another shot.

2701
01:59:58,441 --> 01:59:59,388
MARISHA: Come on, Percy.

2702
01:59:59,388 --> 02:00:00,233
LIAM: Come on, baby.

2703
02:00:00,233 --> 02:00:01,258
TALIESIN: He's such an asshole.

2704
02:00:01,258 --> 02:00:02,402
MARISHA: Like fish in a barrel.

2705
02:00:02,402 --> 02:00:03,403
LIAM: Come on, Von Rolo!

2706
02:00:03,403 --> 02:00:05,242
TALIESIN: 15.

2707
02:00:05,242 --> 02:00:08,175
MATT: 15? Unfortunately, it does not hit.

2708
02:00:08,175 --> 02:00:11,059
LIAM: (ricochet noise)

2709
02:00:11,059 --> 02:00:14,891
MATT: At that distance, with the darkness, it's
very hard to get your bead on him at that point.

2710
02:00:14,891 --> 02:00:17,501
So you (gunshot), fires off, you can now see it
drift away--

2711
02:00:17,501 --> 02:00:18,429
LAURA: Fudge!

2712
02:00:18,429 --> 02:00:20,542
MATT: -- and all the rest of the duergar are now
retreating into the city.

2713
02:00:20,542 --> 02:00:22,439
TALIESIN: Man!

2714
02:00:22,439 --> 02:00:27,982
LAURA: What're you gonna do? All of our shit's
gone.

2715
02:00:27,982 --> 02:00:28,899
MARISHA: Okay.

2716
02:00:28,899 --> 02:00:30,038
TRAVIS: Okay. What're we gonna do? Leave?

2717
02:00:30,038 --> 02:00:31,080
LAURA: Maybe we can-- can we walk up and see--

2718
02:00:31,080 --> 02:00:31,929
ORION: Let's take a short rest.

2719
02:00:31,929 --> 02:00:33,099
LAURA: -- if we can find another bridge?

2720
02:00:33,099 --> 02:00:34,171
ORION: While we're figuring this out.

2721
02:00:34,171 --> 02:00:36,163
MATT: If you want to. Okay. So you walk over to
the edge, and you kind of look across to the

2722
02:00:36,163 --> 02:00:38,718
sides. Make a perception check.

2723
02:00:38,718 --> 02:00:40,130
TALIESIN: I'll assist.

2724
02:00:40,130 --> 02:00:40,884
LAURA: Oh, 20!

2725
02:00:40,884 --> 02:00:41,603
LIAM: 20.

2726
02:00:41,603 --> 02:00:42,408
TALIESIN: Never mind!

2727
02:00:42,408 --> 02:00:43,270
LAURA: No, no assistance needed.

2728
02:00:43,270 --> 02:00:44,050
MATT: Natural 20?

2729
02:00:44,050 --> 02:00:44,716
LIAM: Yeah.

2730
02:00:44,716 --> 02:00:45,436
TALIESIN: Never mind.

2731
02:00:45,436 --> 02:00:46,239
MATT: Natural 20.

2732
02:00:46,239 --> 02:00:46,912
LAURA &amp; LIAM: Yes.

2733
02:00:46,912 --> 02:00:47,514
MATT: Plus--

2734
02:00:47,514 --> 02:00:48,232
LAURA: Plus my perception?

2735
02:00:48,232 --> 02:00:49,108
LIAM: (high-pitched) Natural 20 motherfucker!

2736
02:00:49,108 --> 02:00:50,016
LAURA: My perception is six.

2737
02:00:50,016 --> 02:00:50,902
LIAM: (high-pitched) Automatic win!

2738
02:00:50,902 --> 02:00:51,720
MATT: You glance over the side--

2739
02:00:51,720 --> 02:00:52,489
(all laugh)

2740
02:00:52,489 --> 02:00:54,980
MATT: -- and looking down, you can see the bridge
is just kind of like drifting from the air that's

2741
02:00:54,980 --> 02:00:58,100
flowing, and you can just see the-- and it's not
like the whole bottom floor is all lava, there's

2742
02:00:58,100 --> 02:01:04,036
just streaks of it pouring down from whatever the
interior of this lower chasm is. You see, at the

2743
02:01:04,036 --> 02:01:07,832
edge of the rope break, which goes down for a good
150, 200 feet or so, dangling,

2744
02:01:07,832 --> 02:01:10,979
and there's a tiny little flicker of material--

2745
02:01:10,979 --> 02:01:12,242
LAURA: (gasps)

2746
02:01:12,242 --> 02:01:14,189
MATT: -- wrapped up in the ropes of the rope
bridge.

2747
02:01:14,189 --> 02:01:15,041
LAURA: Oh my god.

2748
02:01:15,041 --> 02:01:15,833
TRAVIS: It's the carpet!

2749
02:01:15,833 --> 02:01:16,564
SAM: Material? It's the carpet!

2750
02:01:16,564 --> 02:01:18,545
MATT: It's the carpet! It seems to be the carpet.

2751
02:01:18,545 --> 02:01:19,475
TALIESIN: Okay. We have an infinite rope!

2752
02:01:19,475 --> 02:01:20,285
MARISHA: Oh! Go!

2753
02:01:20,285 --> 02:01:21,374
LAURA: We have infinite rope! I'm gonna tie it to
myself--

2754
02:01:21,374 --> 02:01:22,105
ORION: Wait, hold on a second--

2755
02:01:22,105 --> 02:01:22,865
TALIESIN: We're gonna lower you down.

2756
02:01:22,865 --> 02:01:25,442
ORION: Is it still-- it's just at the end of the--
all the way down there?

2757
02:01:25,442 --> 02:01:26,721
MATT: Mm-hm.

2758
02:01:26,721 --> 02:01:27,613
ORION: So I fly down there--

2759
02:01:27,613 --> 02:01:28,370
LAURA: No-- aww.

2760
02:01:28,370 --> 02:01:29,174
ORION: -- and go get it!

2761
02:01:29,174 --> 02:01:30,051
SAM: Yeah, that makes sense.

2762
02:01:30,051 --> 02:01:31,015
LAURA: Oh, all right.

2763
02:01:31,015 --> 02:01:32,022
ORION: It's still in effect!

2764
02:01:32,022 --> 02:01:32,696
MATT: Mm-hm.

2765
02:01:32,696 --> 02:01:33,754
SAM: Okay, watch out for that warm air, whatever
that was.

2766
02:01:33,754 --> 02:01:34,525
MATT: So.

2767
02:01:34,525 --> 02:01:37,798
ORION: Ooh. You're right. I take out an empty
bottle while I do this.

2768
02:01:37,798 --> 02:01:48,982
MATT: All right. You glide down along the base of
the cut rope bridge, and there, just barely

2769
02:01:48,982 --> 02:01:52,621
hanging on by just haphazardly falling and
tangling itself in the ropes is the

2770
02:01:52,621 --> 02:01:56,796
flying carpet. As you float down, you now get a
little bit of a better view, as your staff is lit,

2771
02:01:56,870 --> 02:02:06,262
you can see, about another 150 feet down below
you, a little bit of a reflection of your light.

2772
02:02:06,262 --> 02:02:08,962
It's currently just kind of rippling and
shifting.

2773
02:02:08,962 --> 02:02:10,345
LAURA: (gasps) It's water down there?

2774
02:02:10,345 --> 02:02:11,519
MARISHA and SAM: It's water?

2775
02:02:11,519 --> 02:02:15,252
MATT: It appears to be some sort of water surface
below you. About 150 feet down.

2776
02:02:15,252 --> 02:02:16,270
SAM: I thought there was lava--

2777
02:02:16,270 --> 02:02:17,608
TRAVIS: I run and jump off the cliff!

2778
02:02:17,608 --> 02:02:18,426
MATT: There are streaks of lava--

2779
02:02:18,426 --> 02:02:19,311
LAURA: No you don't.

2780
02:02:19,311 --> 02:02:20,390
MATT: -- pouring, like from the ceiling and
portions of the wall--

2781
02:02:20,390 --> 02:02:21,369
TRAVIS: Yep, and I jumped all the way down.

2782
02:02:21,369 --> 02:02:22,334
LAURA: It's 1000 feet down.

2783
02:02:22,334 --> 02:02:23,610
MATT: -- but it's all just kind of pouring down
and pooling at the edges and then cooling.

2784
02:02:23,610 --> 02:02:24,748
LAURA: It's 1000 feet.

2785
02:02:24,748 --> 02:02:25,707
LIAM: That's a big belly flop.

2786
02:02:25,707 --> 02:02:26,879
TRAVIS: I have great form in mid-air.

2787
02:02:26,879 --> 02:02:27,908
SAM: So there, it's a river--

2788
02:02:27,908 --> 02:02:28,963
ORION: And you don't know this yet.

2789
02:02:28,963 --> 02:02:29,905
LAURA: Do you want to die?

2790
02:02:29,905 --> 02:02:31,104
MATT: And you can see the waterfall, it's
cascading over the side--

2791
02:02:31,104 --> 02:02:32,203
TRAVIS: It's water.

2792
02:02:32,203 --> 02:02:33,879
LAURA: You're being incredibly childish. Don't do
that.

2793
02:02:33,879 --> 02:02:35,459
MATT: -- is currently rushing past you at about 30
feet to your right, and it seems to be splashing

2794
02:02:35,459 --> 02:02:36,625
into this pool below.

2795
02:02:36,625 --> 02:02:38,740
LAURA: Don't. Dive. 1000 fucking feet.

2796
02:02:38,740 --> 02:02:39,833
ORION: Waterfall. Ah!

2797
02:02:39,833 --> 02:02:41,789
I retrieve the magic carpet.

2798
02:02:41,860 --> 02:02:44,309
MATT: You grab the magic carpet, you roll it up,
make your way back up to the surface.

2799
02:02:44,309 --> 02:02:46,062
MARISHA: Carpet!

2800
02:02:46,062 --> 02:02:53,296
ORION: Ah, here you are. By the way, cool stuff
down there. It's actually not lava, it's water!

2801
02:02:53,296 --> 02:02:54,938
Aha. Believe it or not.

2802
02:02:54,938 --> 02:02:56,548
LAURA: Water? How far down from the bridge?

2803
02:02:56,548 --> 02:03:02,409
ORION: It's about 150 feet from the bridge, but
it's about 1000 feet down all the way. We could

2804
02:03:02,409 --> 02:03:08,085
traverse down, somehow, and I think it would be a
nice place to go explore.

2805
02:03:08,085 --> 02:03:09,610
SAM: Place to go explore?

2806
02:03:09,610 --> 02:03:11,244
ORION: Especially because we have nothing else to
do, and--

2807
02:03:11,244 --> 02:03:13,593
SAM: Well, we could go to the camp and go kick
some--

2808
02:03:13,593 --> 02:03:16,172
LAURA: Well, look, we know-- we can't get over
there.

2809
02:03:16,229 --> 02:03:17,561
SAM: But we have a carpet now!

2810
02:03:17,561 --> 02:03:18,341
ORION: Oh, that's right.

2811
02:03:18,341 --> 02:03:19,016
LAURA: Oh.

2812
02:03:19,016 --> 02:03:20,137
TRAVIS: Yeah, but we go over one at a time and
then we're waiting for--

2813
02:03:20,137 --> 02:03:20,966
MARISHA: Ah, fly me down with you.

2814
02:03:20,966 --> 02:03:21,803
LAURA: The thing is--

2815
02:03:21,803 --> 02:03:22,724
SAM: The three of us can fly.

2816
02:03:22,724 --> 02:03:24,136
MARISHA: Tiberius and I are going to fly down.

2817
02:03:24,136 --> 02:03:24,890
LAURA: The thing is, we know that--

2818
02:03:24,890 --> 02:03:25,567
MARISHA: On the carpet.

2819
02:03:25,567 --> 02:03:26,667
LAURA: -- deeper down is where they've gone.

2820
02:03:26,667 --> 02:03:27,851
MARISHA: Yes. That's true.

2821
02:03:27,851 --> 02:03:32,100
LAURA: So probably it'd be best to go down. We
could have avoided all of this bullshit if we'd

2822
02:03:32,100 --> 02:03:33,276
just have known--

2823
02:03:33,276 --> 02:03:34,403
LIAM: But we didn't know, and if there's--

2824
02:03:34,403 --> 02:03:35,601
MARISHA: I don't wanna fight, I don't wanna fight
that guy.

2825
02:03:35,601 --> 02:03:37,194
LIAM: -- if there's more than one of them these,
though, he's gone boodle-oodle-ooo to his friends

2826
02:03:37,194 --> 02:03:38,468
right now, I mean--

2827
02:03:38,468 --> 02:03:39,389
LAURA: Right.

2828
02:03:39,389 --> 02:03:42,474
LIAM: -- if we can it'd be good to put this guy in
the ground.

2829
02:03:42,474 --> 02:03:43,350
SAM: I'm all for going--

2830
02:03:43,350 --> 02:03:45,260
MARISHA: I don't know. Okay, take me down--

2831
02:03:45,260 --> 02:03:46,540
SAM: There's a tunnel back there--

2832
02:03:46,540 --> 02:03:47,858
MARISHA: Hang on, let me, let's go see, let's go
see.

2833
02:03:47,858 --> 02:03:49,248
SAM: -- back, past that village, that they're
protecting.

2834
02:03:49,248 --> 02:03:50,809
ORION: Well, I'm still flying, you can take--
Percy, would you like to come?

2835
02:03:50,809 --> 02:03:51,898
TALIESIN: Oh, all right.

2836
02:03:51,898 --> 02:03:56,159
MARISHA: I've-- to ride the carpet down to the
bottom with Percy and Tiberius.

2837
02:03:56,159 --> 02:04:00,893
ORION: Well, I-- whoever's going down should be on
the carpet, 'cause I can still fly.

2838
02:04:00,893 --> 02:04:01,618
MARISHA: Right.

2839
02:04:01,618 --> 02:04:02,660
ORION: So, I don't need it.

2840
02:04:02,660 --> 02:04:03,715
MARISHA: Me and Percy are on the carpet.

2841
02:04:03,715 --> 02:04:05,544
MATT: All right, so the two of you get on the
carpet, you drift down, and you begin to make your

2842
02:04:05,544 --> 02:04:09,423
way down this giant crevasse. As you get down, the
air gets warmer and warmer, and you begin to see

2843
02:04:09,423 --> 02:04:14,894
as you come down, a good 600 feet now at this
point, into this much larger space than the one

2844
02:04:14,894 --> 02:04:21,543
you guys are currently above. It's like a giant,
triangular, open cavern down here. It kind of

2845
02:04:21,543 --> 02:04:23,739
funnels up into where the bridge was.

2846
02:04:23,739 --> 02:04:29,017
MARISHA: Do I see any tunnels, or areas that look
like it leads someplace of interest?

2847
02:04:29,017 --> 02:04:33,867
MATT: As you look down, there is definitely a
large pool of water that leads off into a few

2848
02:04:33,867 --> 02:04:41,175
other underground rivers that spill off into the
mountainside itself. There are sections of the

2849
02:04:41,175 --> 02:04:45,056
wall where lava is pouring out, where there seems
to be some sort of a vent or some sort of opening

2850
02:04:45,056 --> 02:04:49,519
into some magma reserve, and there are about three
of them that are pouring out, and kind of drifting

2851
02:04:49,519 --> 02:04:54,348
down. One of them is pooling and cooling as it
hits the water, and it's just kind of this

2852
02:04:54,348 --> 02:05:01,255
perpetually glowing mass of slow-growing rock.
There also appears to be one that is just

2853
02:05:01,328 --> 02:05:05,548
continuing to flow that leads, kind of, back in
the direction where you guys came, but underneath.

2854
02:05:05,548 --> 02:05:09,730
There's one big lava pool that is spilling, and
then kind of giving a little bit of light to the

2855
02:05:09,730 --> 02:05:14,710
inside of a tunnel that continues further down at
a decline. The opposite side--

2856
02:05:14,710 --> 02:05:16,190
SAM: Lava tunnels? What, are you crazy?

2857
02:05:16,190 --> 02:05:17,730
MARISHA: I keep going.

2858
02:05:17,730 --> 02:05:18,843
SAM: Sorry, yes?

2859
02:05:18,843 --> 02:05:19,711
MATT: That's okay.

2860
02:05:19,711 --> 02:05:20,506
MARISHA: Are you done?

2861
02:05:20,506 --> 02:05:23,713
MATT: On the opposite side, you can see there's a
small outcropping and a smaller waterfall that is

2862
02:05:23,713 --> 02:05:29,169
pouring out of the side of the mountain, like
another sea is now meeting the river underneath,

2863
02:05:29,169 --> 02:05:34,435
and that is just kind of cascading out from the
side of the rock, dropping about 30 or 40 feet,

2864
02:05:34,435 --> 02:05:36,134
and hitting the edge of the rock pool.

2865
02:05:36,134 --> 02:05:37,003
MARISHA: Okay.

2866
02:05:37,003 --> 02:05:37,876
LIAM: On Cthulhu's side, you're talking about?

2867
02:05:37,876 --> 02:05:39,493
MATT: On Cthulhu's side. Yeah.

2868
02:05:39,493 --> 02:05:41,391
ORION: I think we should--

2869
02:05:41,460 --> 02:05:44,775
MARISHA: I say, Tiberius, give me some light?

2870
02:05:44,775 --> 02:05:45,992
ORION: Oh!

2871
02:05:45,992 --> 02:05:52,050
MARISHA: And I take-- and I cast Control Water,
and I just take the pool-- the water in the bottom

2872
02:05:52,050 --> 02:05:57,356
of the pool, and I bend it, and I part the pool,
and I take it and I cascade it all the way up,

2873
02:05:57,356 --> 02:05:59,002
following the lava flows.

2874
02:05:59,002 --> 02:06:04,178
MATT: Okay. Just so you're aware, the pool is
about 600 feet across.

2875
02:06:04,178 --> 02:06:05,444
(all laugh)

2876
02:06:05,444 --> 02:06:06,565
MARISHA: I can part seas with this.

2877
02:06:06,565 --> 02:06:10,601
MATT: Right. So you can part elements of it, but
like, it is a large, large, large body of water.

2878
02:06:10,601 --> 02:06:13,712
MARISHA: Oh, okay, okay. Well I'm taking-- okay. I
don't necessarily part it, but I take the water,

2879
02:06:13,712 --> 02:06:17,113
and I draw it up, cascading along the edges
following

2880
02:06:17,113 --> 02:06:20,349
all the lava streams going into the tunnels.

2881
02:06:20,349 --> 02:06:24,274
MATT: Okay, another thing you notice, is there are
two trolls and an ogre currently trying to stay

2882
02:06:24,274 --> 02:06:29,098
afloat, as one of them just (sucking sound) gets
pulled under the water.

2883
02:06:29,098 --> 02:06:30,077
LAURA: Gets pulled under?

2884
02:06:30,077 --> 02:06:31,084
MATT: Yes.

2885
02:06:31,084 --> 02:06:32,134
SAM: (yells)

2886
02:06:32,134 --> 02:06:36,195
MATT: You begin moving the water to the sides and
you begin to cool some of the lava flows.

2887
02:06:36,195 --> 02:06:37,350
ORION: Oh, that's awesome.

2888
02:06:37,350 --> 02:06:41,558
MATT: You can see the glowing red magma begin to
cool to a dark black and become solid. As it does

2889
02:06:41,558 --> 02:06:44,770
you can see parts of it crack, as the magma's
still pushing out. But you're definitely

2890
02:06:44,770 --> 02:06:46,294
staunching the flow.

2891
02:06:46,294 --> 02:06:50,641
MARISHA: I'm gonna kind of push it, you said there
was a tunnel kind of going up into Cthulhu side?

2892
02:06:50,641 --> 02:06:57,106
MATT: Yeah, there is a tunnel that seemed-- the
opening leads to the back, and there's a waterfall

2893
02:06:57,106 --> 02:06:59,147
that is pouring out from that side.

2894
02:06:59,147 --> 02:07:00,135
ORION: Waterfall.

2895
02:07:00,135 --> 02:07:00,853
MARISHA: There's a waterfall.

2896
02:07:00,853 --> 02:07:01,565
MATT: Waterfall.

2897
02:07:01,565 --> 02:07:02,459
ORION: Not a lava fall.

2898
02:07:02,459 --> 02:07:05,109
MATT: The lava flow is going down the opposite
direction.

2899
02:07:05,109 --> 02:07:07,709
MARISHA: But there's like a tunnel kind of carving
out that way?

2900
02:07:07,709 --> 02:07:09,395
MATT: Yeah. Like a large opening that continues
further down.

2901
02:07:09,395 --> 02:07:13,019
MARISHA: Okay, I take all of the water, and I
really just concentrate, and I gather just a big

2902
02:07:13,019 --> 02:07:15,414
tube, and I push it down that tunnel.

2903
02:07:15,414 --> 02:07:20,307
MATT: Okay, so the best-- the water that you
gather from this, you force into a quick geyser in

2904
02:07:20,307 --> 02:07:25,873
that direction. As it sprays across the front, you
can see it begins to cool some of the magma. It's

2905
02:07:25,873 --> 02:07:32,076
a pretty hefty flow, you manage to slow it, and
you do cool parts of it, but it's gonna be

2906
02:07:32,076 --> 02:07:36,019
difficult and take you a while, if you're just
constantly pushing water on it, to give the flow

2907
02:07:36,019 --> 02:07:41,570
any sort of serious stop. You notice the lava flow
doesn't coat the entire floor of the tunnel, just

2908
02:07:41,570 --> 02:07:44,432
a side of it. It's almost like there's some
portion of it that is walkable,

2909
02:07:44,432 --> 02:07:46,179
adjacent to the lava.

2910
02:07:46,179 --> 02:07:49,992
ORION: We can also go in the not-lava cave,
Keyleth.

2911
02:07:49,992 --> 02:07:54,763
MARISHA: I'm sorry, that lava cave just looks
important.

2912
02:07:54,763 --> 02:07:56,872
ORION: I know. Because of the lava.

2913
02:07:56,872 --> 02:07:58,651
MARISHA: Yeah.

2914
02:07:58,651 --> 02:08:01,433
ORION: Let's go tell the others what we've
found, and then we'll

2915
02:08:01,433 --> 02:08:02,819
come back and decide which way to go.

2916
02:08:02,819 --> 02:08:03,627
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

2917
02:08:03,627 --> 02:08:04,817
TALIESIN: Sometimes a lava cave is just a lava
cave.

2918
02:08:04,817 --> 02:08:05,897
ORION: I fly back up.

2919
02:08:05,897 --> 02:08:06,729
MATT: Okay.

2920
02:08:06,729 --> 02:08:08,704
ORION: Guys. Blah-blah-blah-blah.

2921
02:08:08,704 --> 02:08:10,219
SAM: So here's my thoughts.

2922
02:08:10,219 --> 02:08:12,796
MATT: The other troll. (sucking sound) Pulled
beneath the surface.

2923
02:08:12,796 --> 02:08:14,130
SAM: Yeah, so, I don't wanna go down there--

2924
02:08:14,130 --> 02:08:15,508
MARISHA: Also, it looks like there's something
eating those trolls.

2925
02:08:15,508 --> 02:08:18,139
SAM: -- there's things pulling trolls. Yeah, let's
not go down there where there's things eating

2926
02:08:18,139 --> 02:08:19,749
trolls! Why don't we just--

2927
02:08:19,749 --> 02:08:20,756
ORION: In the water?

2928
02:08:20,756 --> 02:08:21,654
SAM: Yeah!

2929
02:08:21,654 --> 02:08:22,807
MATT: Yeah. In the giant water pool in the
bottom.

2930
02:08:22,807 --> 02:08:24,139
LAURA: Wait, but we're gonna have to go down
eventually, so.

2931
02:08:24,139 --> 02:08:24,840
LIAM: Maybe.

2932
02:08:24,840 --> 02:08:25,670
SAM: Why?

2933
02:08:25,670 --> 02:08:26,637
LAURA: Okay.

2934
02:08:26,637 --> 02:08:29,660
SAM: Why do we have to go down there, there's
nothing that we need down there!

2935
02:08:29,660 --> 02:08:35,065
ORION: But across the way is a 25-man battle with
a huge, nasty boss.

2936
02:08:35,065 --> 02:08:36,833
SAM: There's seven of us and one of us is Grog!

2937
02:08:36,833 --> 02:08:38,975
LAURA: Well, everybody keeps saying that
everything is deeper and deeper, so I think we're

2938
02:08:38,975 --> 02:08:39,805
gonna have to go--

2939
02:08:39,805 --> 02:08:40,523
MARISHA: Yeah.

2940
02:08:40,523 --> 02:08:41,504
LAURA: -- deep down. Eventually.

2941
02:08:41,504 --> 02:08:42,487
MARISHA: I agree with Vex on this one.

2942
02:08:42,487 --> 02:08:43,497
LIAM: Well, hold on.

2943
02:08:43,497 --> 02:08:44,414
SAM: Deep into the tunnels.

2944
02:08:44,414 --> 02:08:47,368
LIAM: All those assholes are still standing on the
edge across there. Do we have-- we've flown out of

2945
02:08:47,368 --> 02:08:51,260
a falling tower before, we were all able to do it,
can we just fly up and

2946
02:08:51,260 --> 02:08:54,444
over those shitheads and go towards the tunnel?

2947
02:08:54,444 --> 02:08:56,073
ORION: Not with the eye of that mind flayer.

2948
02:08:56,073 --> 02:08:57,360
LAURA: Yeah. It can grab us.

2949
02:08:57,360 --> 02:08:58,747
MARISHA: Yeah, look what it did to you!

2950
02:08:58,747 --> 02:08:59,482
ORION: I don't trust it.

2951
02:08:59,482 --> 02:09:00,450
LAURA: Exactly.

2952
02:09:00,450 --> 02:09:01,808
LIAM: Can't we go 150 feet in the air, and--

2953
02:09:01,808 --> 02:09:02,729
LAURA: The tunnel doesn't go that high.

2954
02:09:02,729 --> 02:09:04,901
MARISHA: I think you were at least 150 feet across
that bridge when he did that to you.

2955
02:09:04,901 --> 02:09:06,165
LAURA: Yeah. It can grab us from there.

2956
02:09:06,165 --> 02:09:07,527
SAM: We can try--

2957
02:09:07,527 --> 02:09:10,152
LIAM: I was on the bridge when that happened--

2958
02:09:10,152 --> 02:09:11,374
MATT: You were on the bridge when that happened,
you were--

2959
02:09:11,374 --> 02:09:12,511
LIAM: -- and fell down. I wasn't way above.

2960
02:09:12,511 --> 02:09:14,154
MARISHA: But the bridge was like 250 feet across,
right?

2961
02:09:14,154 --> 02:09:17,474
MATT: Right. You were about, loosely, 80 feet
across when it got you.

2962
02:09:17,474 --> 02:09:18,368
LIAM: When it got me.

2963
02:09:18,368 --> 02:09:19,537
ORION: So its range is probably like 100 feet.

2964
02:09:19,537 --> 02:09:21,865
LIAM: And you said it's 150-ish feet in here,
though, to the ceiling?

2965
02:09:21,865 --> 02:09:24,377
MATT: To the ceiling it's about 150 feet, yeah.

2966
02:09:24,377 --> 02:09:25,184
LIAM: We can go--

2967
02:09:25,184 --> 02:09:27,722
LAURA: But the tunnel, oh--

2968
02:09:27,722 --> 02:09:30,637
TALIESIN: They have ranged weapons as well.

2969
02:09:30,637 --> 02:09:32,111
LAURA: (quietly) I think we should go down!

2970
02:09:32,111 --> 02:09:34,254
SAM: But what is down there?

2971
02:09:34,254 --> 02:09:35,445
TRAVIS: If we don't find out.

2972
02:09:35,445 --> 02:09:36,771
LAURA: Kima!

2973
02:09:36,826 --> 02:09:38,149
TRAVIS: You can drop me like a depth charge.

2974
02:09:38,149 --> 02:09:40,598
SAM: But there's no sign of anything intelligent
down there, other than something that's eating

2975
02:09:40,598 --> 02:09:46,294
trolls underwater. It could be just giant whales
down there! We have no idea! There's no sign of

2976
02:09:46,294 --> 02:09:50,314
humans at all! It's lava and death animals!

2977
02:09:50,314 --> 02:09:51,834
LAURA: Maybe, okay. If I go down there--

2978
02:09:51,834 --> 02:09:53,162
ORION: There's more like tunnels, that go
further--

2979
02:09:53,162 --> 02:09:54,636
LAURA: -- and look in one of the tunnels--

2980
02:09:54,636 --> 02:09:55,906
MARISHA: Tunnels that go deeper!

2981
02:09:55,906 --> 02:09:57,683
LAURA: -- can I look in one of the tunnels and see
if I find tracks? If I do, can we go that way?

2982
02:09:57,683 --> 02:09:58,774
SAM: How're you gonna go in the tunnels?

2983
02:09:58,774 --> 02:09:59,665
LAURA: I've got a flying carpet!

2984
02:09:59,665 --> 02:10:00,487
SAM: There's lava!

2985
02:10:00,487 --> 02:10:02,073
LAURA: There's tunnels that don't have lava
flowing into them.

2986
02:10:02,073 --> 02:10:02,928
SAM: If you burn--

2987
02:10:02,928 --> 02:10:04,454
MARISHA: And I can control water for at least an
hour.

2988
02:10:04,454 --> 02:10:05,911
ORION: There's, so, down there, there's a big pool
of water--

2989
02:10:05,911 --> 02:10:06,773
MARISHA: It lasts a while.

2990
02:10:06,773 --> 02:10:10,388
ORION: -- a tunnel going towards the mind flayer
side, with no lava--

2991
02:10:10,388 --> 02:10:11,181
LAURA: Exactly!

2992
02:10:11,181 --> 02:10:12,620
ORION: -- and then there's another cave with
lava--

2993
02:10:12,620 --> 02:10:13,970
LAURA: There is a tunnel that we can walk in.

2994
02:10:13,970 --> 02:10:15,316
ORION: -- that we can go, going away from him.

2995
02:10:15,316 --> 02:10:16,717
TALIESIN: Let's see if there's anything resembling
tracks--

2996
02:10:16,717 --> 02:10:17,567
LAURA: Yes!

2997
02:10:17,567 --> 02:10:20,219
MARISHA: I'll go with Vex that-a-way. I can cool
lava as we go.

2998
02:10:20,219 --> 02:10:22,429
LAURA: Please, Scanlan, let me look for tracks.
Please?

2999
02:10:22,429 --> 02:10:23,957
SAM: Tracks in a river?

3000
02:10:23,957 --> 02:10:25,409
LAURA: Tracks in a tunnel.

3001
02:10:25,409 --> 02:10:26,925
SAM: It's not that kind of a tunnel!

3002
02:10:26,925 --> 02:10:27,620
LAURA: It is!

3003
02:10:27,620 --> 02:10:29,082
SAM: There's water flowing in it!

3004
02:10:29,082 --> 02:10:34,946
MATT: There is, on-- Okay. In a giant cavern,
there is, towards the side where you guys kind of

3005
02:10:34,946 --> 02:10:36,289
entered, underneath where you first came in--

3006
02:10:36,289 --> 02:10:37,005
LAURA: Yes.

3007
02:10:37,005 --> 02:10:41,442
MATT: -- there is a descending, large tunnel, of
which there are a series of lava flows that kind

3008
02:10:41,442 --> 02:10:44,906
of pool into one river of lava that covers half of
that path down--

3009
02:10:44,906 --> 02:10:45,635
LAURA: Okay.

3010
02:10:45,635 --> 02:10:46,604
LIAM: In the direction of goblin town.

3011
02:10:46,604 --> 02:10:47,278
MATT: Correct.

3012
02:10:47,278 --> 02:10:48,089
LAURA: Okay.

3013
02:10:48,089 --> 02:10:49,260
MATT: Towards the other side, the--

3014
02:10:49,260 --> 02:10:50,358
LIAM: The Cthulhu side.

3015
02:10:50,358 --> 02:10:53,857
MATT: The cavern ends and there is a waterfall
pouring out of the side of the wall--

3016
02:10:53,857 --> 02:10:54,719
SAM: Can't go in there.

3017
02:10:54,719 --> 02:10:56,018
MATT: -- that just kind of flows down--

3018
02:10:56,018 --> 02:10:57,842
SAM: Oh, so there's a cavern opening?

3019
02:10:57,842 --> 02:11:02,122
MATT: No, no. There is a-- there-- well, there is
essentially a hole where water is pouring out of.

3020
02:11:02,122 --> 02:11:02,892
SAM: Can't go in there.

3021
02:11:02,892 --> 02:11:03,717
LAURA: Oh.

3022
02:11:03,717 --> 02:11:04,700
MARISHA: We can go in there!

3023
02:11:04,700 --> 02:11:05,815
TALIESIN: But we can go in the one with lava.

3024
02:11:05,815 --> 02:11:07,135
SAM: There's water pouring out of it!

3025
02:11:07,135 --> 02:11:08,753
MARISHA: I can make that stop happening.

3026
02:11:08,753 --> 02:11:11,985
SAM: But what would we find in a tunnel with water
pouring out of it?

3027
02:11:11,985 --> 02:11:13,926
It's not like anything lives up there!

3028
02:11:13,926 --> 02:11:19,525
MARISHA: I'm just-- I would much rather face
random beasts who are just random beasts, than

3029
02:11:19,525 --> 02:11:21,434
mind flayers who can suck my brain out.

3030
02:11:21,434 --> 02:11:23,183
TALIESIN: There would be no random beasts, though,
it's just nothing but plumbing.

3031
02:11:23,183 --> 02:11:26,701
LIAM: Yes, but Kima did not fall prey to random
beasts, she fell prey to these shits.

3032
02:11:26,701 --> 02:11:29,457
LAURA: All right, fine! Let's do whatever you guys
want to do.

3033
02:11:29,457 --> 02:11:32,638
MARISHA: I think-- I don't think a boss battle-- I
don't think we can fight this guy and win!

3034
02:11:32,638 --> 02:11:35,847
TRAVIS: Vote. Vote. For fuck's sake, vote. Put it
to a vote.

3035
02:11:35,847 --> 02:11:37,051
LIAM: Vote, yes.

3036
02:11:37,051 --> 02:11:42,909
SAM: All right. All in favor of going to the
duergar village and facing the giant fucker.

3037
02:11:42,909 --> 02:11:44,764
LIAM: Up and over, up and over!

3038
02:11:44,764 --> 02:11:49,118
SAM: Or up and over. Or at least getting past it.
That direction. That's four of us.

3039
02:11:49,118 --> 02:11:50,047
TRAVIS: That's four.

3040
02:11:50,047 --> 02:11:53,938
SAM: All in favor of going into the lava flows, to
find something.

3041
02:11:53,938 --> 02:11:54,955
LAURA: Water holes!

3042
02:11:54,955 --> 02:11:55,954
LIAM: Water holes or fire holes?

3043
02:11:55,954 --> 02:11:56,896
MARISHA: Water holes!

3044
02:11:56,896 --> 02:11:57,882
SAM: Mm. Mm.

3045
02:11:57,882 --> 02:11:59,809
MARISHA: Tiberius, you haven't voted!

3046
02:11:59,809 --> 02:12:01,383
ORION: A Draconian does not vote.

3047
02:12:01,383 --> 02:12:02,897
TRAVIS: What are you, Switzerland? C'mon.

3048
02:12:02,897 --> 02:12:04,010
LAURA: It's four against us anyway.

3049
02:12:04,010 --> 02:12:05,536
MARISHA: A Draconian-- you come from a political
family!

3050
02:12:05,536 --> 02:12:06,241
LAURA: We gotta go that way.

3051
02:12:06,241 --> 02:12:09,695
ORION: Well, I don't vote. I don't believe in our
system. Anyway, that's none of your business.

3052
02:12:09,695 --> 02:12:11,027
SAM: Are you a communist?

3053
02:12:11,027 --> 02:12:12,238
(all laugh)

3054
02:12:12,238 --> 02:12:14,045
ORION: I don't know what that means!

3055
02:12:14,045 --> 02:12:20,650
LIAM: Now. Tiberius can fly, Keyleth is an eagle
who can carry a gnome, and maybe my sister?

3056
02:12:20,650 --> 02:12:22,405
LAURA: Ugh, no.

3057
02:12:22,405 --> 02:12:25,781
LIAM: And that leaves Percy and Grog and I on the
flying carpet. Can it hold our weight? Let's give

3058
02:12:25,781 --> 02:12:26,772
it a little test?

3059
02:12:26,772 --> 02:12:27,838
LAURA: And Trinket!

3060
02:12:27,838 --> 02:12:28,817
MARISHA: Okay, well, if this doesn't work, we're
going to the tunnel.

3061
02:12:28,817 --> 02:12:29,806
MATT: The flying carpet can't carry Grog on his
own.

3062
02:12:29,806 --> 02:12:30,880
LAURA: No, then I can't carry Grog.

3063
02:12:30,880 --> 02:12:31,827
TALIESIN: You can, on the other hand, use--

3064
02:12:31,827 --> 02:12:34,538
MARISHA: Can't-- wait, wait, wait. Why can't, why
can't Vex and I just, at least,

3065
02:12:34,538 --> 02:12:35,660
go check it out before we do this?

3066
02:12:35,660 --> 02:12:36,714
LIAM: You lost the vote, Keyleth. You lost the
vote.

3067
02:12:36,714 --> 02:12:37,539
MARISHA: (sighs)

3068
02:12:37,539 --> 02:12:38,444
LAURA: I think we should go.

3069
02:12:38,444 --> 02:12:38,987
LIAM: Feather Fall--

3070
02:12:38,987 --> 02:12:39,886
MARISHA: Let's do it! Fuck it!

3071
02:12:39,886 --> 02:12:40,460
LAURA: Going!

3072
02:12:40,460 --> 02:12:41,380
MARISHA: They don't control us!

3073
02:12:41,380 --> 02:12:42,076
LAURA: We're going.

3074
02:12:42,076 --> 02:12:43,031
MARISHA: Let's do it. We're going.

3075
02:12:43,031 --> 02:12:46,220
MATT: All right, So, what, you ladies hop on the
flying carpet?

3076
02:12:46,220 --> 02:12:47,366
LAURA &amp; MARISHA: Yes.

3077
02:12:47,366 --> 02:12:48,633
LIAM: The fellowship has broken.

3078
02:12:48,633 --> 02:12:50,019
MATT: (laughs) So, as you guys are discussing
this--

3079
02:12:50,019 --> 02:12:51,808
SAM: Wait, you're stealing our flying carpet?

3080
02:12:51,808 --> 02:12:52,947
(all laugh)

3081
02:12:52,947 --> 02:12:53,804
MATT: The two ladies have leaped on the flying
carpet--

3082
02:12:53,804 --> 02:12:55,744
MARISHA: We're just checking it out! We're coming
back! We're coming back.

3083
02:12:55,744 --> 02:12:56,703
LAURA: We're coming back!

3084
02:12:56,703 --> 02:12:58,209
ORION: Throw a red one! Throw a red one.

3085
02:12:58,209 --> 02:12:59,614
MARISHA: Just wait ten god damn minutes.

3086
02:12:59,614 --> 02:13:02,455
MATT: They shout, as they disappear, into the
darkness below the cavern.

3087
02:13:02,455 --> 02:13:04,465
LIAM: The mind flayer isn't on pause!

3088
02:13:04,465 --> 02:13:05,848
LAURA: Okay, I could, I have, wait! I have a--

3089
02:13:05,848 --> 02:13:06,852
ORION: That was gonna go right in my mouth!

3090
02:13:06,852 --> 02:13:07,693
LAURA: I have a lantern.

3091
02:13:07,693 --> 02:13:08,485
MATT: Okay.

3092
02:13:08,485 --> 02:13:09,516
LAURA: Yeah. Cause I have a dungeoneering kit.

3093
02:13:09,516 --> 02:13:10,362
TALIESIN: Oh, cool! Yellow.

3094
02:13:10,362 --> 02:13:13,447
MATT: All right. So you pull out your lantern, as
the two of you are going down towards the water--

3095
02:13:13,447 --> 02:13:14,241
LAURA: Part the water!

3096
02:13:14,241 --> 02:13:17,529
MATT: -- the rest of you kind of stand at the edge
of the crevasse going, 'Uh...'

3097
02:13:17,529 --> 02:13:19,111
ORION: I follow. I follow.

3098
02:13:19,111 --> 02:13:20,191
LAURA: Part the water!

3099
02:13:20,191 --> 02:13:22,530
MARISHA: I take the river flow, where the water's
flow is coming out of this waterfall--

3100
02:13:22,530 --> 02:13:26,700
LIAM: Meanwhile the mind flayer's saying,
(gravelly voice) 'I haven't got all day.'

3101
02:13:26,700 --> 02:13:27,692
MARISHA: -- and I reverse it.

3102
02:13:27,692 --> 02:13:28,989
MATT: All right. So as you guys float down--

3103
02:13:28,989 --> 02:13:29,925
ORION: I follow.

3104
02:13:29,925 --> 02:13:31,822
MATT: -- the two trolls that were missing-- the
ogre is not anywhere to be seen.

3105
02:13:31,822 --> 02:13:33,043
TRAVIS: Fly, you fools!

3106
02:13:33,043 --> 02:13:33,985
LIAM: (laughs)

3107
02:13:33,985 --> 02:13:35,274
MATT: -- there's just a slight ripple in the
water's surface.

3108
02:13:35,274 --> 02:13:36,346
LAURA: We don't wanna land, we just wanna go
towards the tunnel.

3109
02:13:36,346 --> 02:13:40,633
MATT: Right. As you staunch the water supply of
this waterfall, it just kind of holds it in place,

3110
02:13:40,633 --> 02:13:44,137
with enough of a force that the water coming out
is being balanced by the force you're putting back

3111
02:13:44,137 --> 02:13:45,909
on it, it's just kind of holding it there.

3112
02:13:45,909 --> 02:13:47,298
LAURA: Can you lower the water, so we can fly--

3113
02:13:47,298 --> 02:13:51,456
MATT: However, as the water vanishes, beneath
where the waterfall was, you can see an actual

3114
02:13:51,456 --> 02:13:53,626
small tunnel that's carved into the rock--

3115
02:13:53,626 --> 02:13:55,122
LAURA: Fuck all y'all bitches!

3116
02:13:55,122 --> 02:13:56,726
TALIESIN: Whoa. (laughs)

3117
02:13:56,726 --> 02:13:57,990
LIAM: Well, wanna go down?

3118
02:13:57,990 --> 02:13:59,017
LAURA: Let's go in there!

3119
02:13:59,017 --> 02:14:00,322
TRAVIS: That doesn't do anything yet! We don't
know!

3120
02:14:00,322 --> 02:14:01,432
LAURA: Let's go into the tunnel.

3121
02:14:01,432 --> 02:14:05,916
SAM: Meanwhile, back up top, I'm saying, they're
not gonna find anything.

3122
02:14:05,916 --> 02:14:07,644
They're not gonna find any tunnels.

3123
02:14:07,644 --> 02:14:08,734
(all laugh)

3124
02:14:08,734 --> 02:14:11,807
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm agreeing with Scanlan, and I am
mooning off the cliff's face.

3125
02:14:11,987 --> 02:14:14,071
LAURA: So I'm stealthing, let's stealth? Let's be
very quiet.

3126
02:14:14,071 --> 02:14:14,741
MARISHA: Okay.

3127
02:14:14,741 --> 02:14:15,620
ORION: Hold on.

3128
02:14:15,620 --> 02:14:16,335
MATT: All right.

3129
02:14:16,335 --> 02:14:17,269
LAURA: Can you turn into an animal?

3130
02:14:17,269 --> 02:14:18,240
ORION: I fly back up to tell them what's going
on.

3131
02:14:18,240 --> 02:14:18,985
MARISHA: Oh, I can!

3132
02:14:18,985 --> 02:14:21,343
I go into a black panther form.

3133
02:14:21,418 --> 02:14:22,234
MATT: Okay.

3134
02:14:22,234 --> 02:14:23,472
LIAM: Scanlan, remember when we had women in this
party?

3135
02:14:23,472 --> 02:14:24,465
LAURA: Okay, and I stealth.

3136
02:14:24,465 --> 02:14:25,280
SAM: (laughs)

3137
02:14:25,280 --> 02:14:26,335
MATT: Okay, both of you guys roll stealth.

3138
02:14:26,335 --> 02:14:27,585
MARISHA: Panthers have, like, advantage on
stealth, something like that?

3139
02:14:27,585 --> 02:14:28,731
MATT: They have advantage on stealth check. Yeah.

3140
02:14:28,731 --> 02:14:30,231
ORION: You guys are just in further then?

3141
02:14:30,231 --> 02:14:32,468
MARISHA: 16. 13. So 16 plus whatever--

3142
02:14:32,468 --> 02:14:33,457
MATT: Plus your dex.

3143
02:14:33,457 --> 02:14:34,273
LAURA: 15.

3144
02:14:34,273 --> 02:14:35,374
MARISHA: -- the dex of the panther is.

3145
02:14:35,374 --> 02:14:36,031
LAURA: Plus, oh.

3146
02:14:36,031 --> 02:14:37,235
MARISHA: No, it's whatever the dex-- it's gonna be
like--

3147
02:14:37,235 --> 02:14:38,090
ORION: Oh.

3148
02:14:38,090 --> 02:14:39,330
TALIESIN: (sings) The dex of the panther--

3149
02:14:39,330 --> 02:14:40,362
MARISHA: It's gonna be like 20 or something like
that.

3150
02:14:40,362 --> 02:14:44,836
MATT: All right. You guys move-- are you staying
on the carpet?

3151
02:14:44,836 --> 02:14:47,906
LAURA: No, we're like hopping down off the carpet,
and I just want to look around for tracks!

3152
02:14:47,906 --> 02:14:48,796
MARISHA: Plus four.

3153
02:14:48,796 --> 02:14:49,559
ORION: I take the carpet--

3154
02:14:49,559 --> 02:14:50,464
MARISHA: No, plus six.

3155
02:14:50,464 --> 02:14:52,057
ORION: -- and then I bring it up, while I tell
them all that stuff.

3156
02:14:52,057 --> 02:14:53,827
MATT: Okay, so you go back down--

3157
02:14:53,827 --> 02:14:55,989
LAURA: What! You took our carpet?

3158
02:14:55,989 --> 02:14:58,920
ORION: Oh yes, because they need it to get down
here as well.

3159
02:14:58,980 --> 02:15:00,606
LAURA: Oh, we're going-- okay, you guys are joining
us. All right.

3160
02:15:00,606 --> 02:15:02,107
ORION: I was--

3161
02:15:02,282 --> 02:15:03,250
MARISHA: No, we were scouting.

3162
02:15:03,250 --> 02:15:04,651
LAURA: I'm just looking for tracks right now,
Tiberius.

3163
02:15:04,651 --> 02:15:07,935
ORION: Yeah and I followed you, saw what was going
on, took your carpet,

3164
02:15:07,935 --> 02:15:09,231
and I'm giving it back to them.

3165
02:15:09,231 --> 02:15:10,006
LAURA: Oh my god.

3166
02:15:10,006 --> 02:15:10,890
MATT: So as you guys are--

3167
02:15:10,890 --> 02:15:12,491
MARISHA: You can't take our carpet, we're on the
carpet.

3168
02:15:12,491 --> 02:15:13,420
ORION: Oh, I thought you guys hopped off.

3169
02:15:13,420 --> 02:15:15,834
MATT: No, you guys stepped off the carpet, she
said, and you transformed, began stealthing in.

3170
02:15:15,834 --> 02:15:18,850
MARISHA: Oh, that's right. We did transform. Okay,
sure, you can take the carpet.

3171
02:15:18,850 --> 02:15:20,325
MATT: As you're doing that you turn around and see
Tiberius had rolled the carpet

3172
02:15:20,325 --> 02:15:21,748
and is currently taking it away.

3173
02:15:21,748 --> 02:15:23,051
LAURA: You motherfucker.

3174
02:15:23,051 --> 02:15:25,889
MATT: So you guys are on the bottom of this
crevasse and Tiberius disappears into the darkness.

3175
02:15:25,889 --> 02:15:30,541
Okay, well, go ahead and roll-- this would be
survival for tracking?

3176
02:15:30,598 --> 02:15:33,271
Just to get an idea for anything around you see.

3177
02:15:33,271 --> 02:15:34,442
LAURA: 16.

3178
02:15:34,442 --> 02:15:40,138
MATT: You do see some scratches into the mud of
the surface there that lead into a tunnel. You see

3179
02:15:40,138 --> 02:15:45,314
drag marks, you see footprints, and that's the
best you can make out at this in this point in

3180
02:15:45,314 --> 02:15:50,673
time. But the footprints appear to be dwarven, or
dwarf-sized in nature.

3181
02:15:50,673 --> 02:15:53,955
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check to see what the
scratch marks look like? If they look like any

3182
02:15:53,955 --> 02:15:55,443
type of beast I might recognize.

3183
02:15:55,443 --> 02:15:58,469
MATT: The scratch marks are across the ground, it
looks just like fingers being pulled through.

3184
02:15:58,469 --> 02:16:04,058
MARISHA: Any type of residue, any type of slime?

3185
02:16:04,058 --> 02:16:06,216
MATT: No that you can tell, no.

3186
02:16:06,216 --> 02:16:08,584
LAURA: Can we see where the tunnel leads?

3187
02:16:08,584 --> 02:16:11,361
MATT: From what you can see, there's no 
light source in there.

3188
02:16:11,361 --> 02:16:13,499
LAURA: We have the light, remember, when I--

3189
02:16:13,570 --> 02:16:20,025
MATT: So you take a lantern and put it inside. The
tunnel goes back about 25 feet and then stops.

3190
02:16:20,025 --> 02:16:25,211
It's just a little alcove. You see within the
tunnel a series of

3191
02:16:25,211 --> 02:16:28,500
skeletons or bodies that are partially decomposed.

3192
02:16:28,500 --> 02:16:30,246
TALIESIN: Oh. God.

3193
02:16:30,246 --> 02:16:33,470
MATT: And you see what looks like a pile of rags
in the corner.

3194
02:16:33,470 --> 02:16:35,334
TRAVIS: Go check it out.

3195
02:16:35,334 --> 02:16:36,984
LAURA: So we can either run or loot. What should
we do?

3196
02:16:36,984 --> 02:16:38,847
TRAVIS: No, go check it out, ladies.

3197
02:16:38,847 --> 02:16:43,371
SAM: They're not gonna find anything.

3198
02:16:43,371 --> 02:16:48,782
MARISHA: They're telling us not to be stupid
because we don't have support.

3199
02:16:48,782 --> 02:16:51,157
Should we be stupid?

3200
02:16:51,157 --> 02:16:52,205
TRAVIS: Grog says yes.

3201
02:16:52,205 --> 02:16:54,546
LAURA: Oh, I'm so scared, but okay, here's the
thing,

3202
02:16:54,546 --> 02:16:58,373
I remember another situation very similar to this.

3203
02:16:58,373 --> 02:17:00,105
ORION: It was terrible.

3204
02:17:00,105 --> 02:17:05,106
LAURA: And it was the lair of one of those umber 
hulks.

3205
02:17:05,106 --> 02:17:07,445
MARISHA: Right. Why don't we just go back maybe to
the entrance of the--

3206
02:17:07,445 --> 02:17:09,019
LIAM: Vex'ahlia, what is going on down there?

3207
02:17:09,019 --> 02:17:10,916
TRAVIS: No no no no. Be thorough.

3208
02:17:10,916 --> 02:17:12,026
(all laugh)

3209
02:17:12,026 --> 02:17:15,290
LAURA: Oh brother, I think we found the lair of the
umber hulk

3210
02:17:15,375 --> 02:17:16,590
TRAVIS: Are you sure?

3211
02:17:16,590 --> 02:17:18,732
LAURA: Oh, pretty damn sure.

3212
02:17:18,732 --> 02:17:22,722
MATT: It's very-- well, the actual tunnel is maybe
about five to eight feet across and it would not

3213
02:17:22,788 --> 02:17:24,350
be able to fit an umber hulk.

3214
02:17:24,350 --> 02:17:26,998
LAURA: Oh, really? Can I go along the walls very
stealthily

3215
02:17:26,998 --> 02:17:29,711
and see if I can find any opening, anything else?

3216
02:17:29,711 --> 02:17:32,638
MATT: As you step inside and put your hands
across the walls--

3217
02:17:32,638 --> 02:17:34,744
TALIESIN and LAURA: Oh God. Oh.

3218
02:17:34,744 --> 02:17:40,314
MATT: --what you do notice is, the walls are
solid. This appears to have been carved out over time.

3219
02:17:40,314 --> 02:17:47,427
And as you move in, you begin to see the rags, and
the pile of rags is less a pile of rags and more

3220
02:17:47,487 --> 02:17:55,617
some sort of humanoid curled up in on the inside.
Unconscious, asleep, or dead. Not moving.

3221
02:17:55,617 --> 02:17:58,075
MARISHA: What is she-- what do they look like?

3222
02:17:58,075 --> 02:18:02,097
MATT: You can't tell from here. It's just like
kind of curled over in the corner.

3223
02:18:02,097 --> 02:18:03,047
TRAVIS: Go in there.

3224
02:18:03,047 --> 02:18:06,716
TALIESIN: I'd like to roll a save against smugness
really quickly. Can I save against smugness? I

3225
02:18:06,716 --> 02:18:08,949
feel a wave of smugness in here.

3226
02:18:08,949 --> 02:18:11,735
MATT: I think you might. You're not saved against
smugness, Percy.

3227
02:18:11,735 --> 02:18:18,460
LAURA: Keyleth, I think you should turn into an
eagle. Can she turn into

3228
02:18:18,460 --> 02:18:20,592
something big enough that can carry me?

3229
02:18:20,592 --> 02:18:24,502
MATT: She can. Yeah. A giant eagle, I believe you
can.

3230
02:18:24,502 --> 02:18:29,132
LAURA: What if you turn into something big enough
that it can carry me, I hop on your back and we

3231
02:18:29,132 --> 02:18:32,605
throw something at it? And then fly away.

3232
02:18:32,605 --> 02:18:33,808
(all laugh)

3233
02:18:33,808 --> 02:18:36,778
MATT: While you guys are having this conversation,
'cause you're talking to each other--

3234
02:18:36,838 --> 02:18:38,829
LAURA: Fuck. We were talking really quietly.

3235
02:18:38,829 --> 02:18:46,848
MATT: -- the thing in the corner kind of rouses
and shoots up out of sudden fear movement, looking

3236
02:18:46,848 --> 02:18:57,232
about. You see, dressed in rags-- you guys are
seeing this for the first time, but it's familiar.

3237
02:18:57,232 --> 02:19:04,820
Smooth head, purplish and blue in color, a series
of tentacles in its mouth. A giant scar drawn

3238
02:19:04,820 --> 02:19:13,461
across one of its eyes, and it looks filthy, and
it looks desperate. And just looks at the two of

3239
02:19:13,523 --> 02:19:17,106
you and you hear a sudden voice in your minds.

3240
02:19:17,106 --> 02:19:18,147
LAURA: Oh fuck!

3241
02:19:18,147 --> 02:19:25,335
MATT: No movement, just conversation, saying, 
"What, who are you?"

3242
02:19:25,396 --> 02:19:32,860
MARISHA: I drop to my knees and I look at him and
just say, it's okay, we're friends.

3243
02:19:32,860 --> 02:19:37,697
MATT: He puts up a hand like this and you see
there's a flicker of arcane energy and a barrier

3244
02:19:37,697 --> 02:19:41,246
appears between you and this creature. And just
looks.

3245
02:19:41,246 --> 02:19:47,368
MARISHA: I take my Druidcraft and I just make a
little flower.

3246
02:19:47,368 --> 02:19:48,450
LAURA: Oh my God.

3247
02:19:48,450 --> 02:19:50,915
(all laugh)

3248
02:19:50,915 --> 02:19:59,333
MARISHA: And there's a pretty little tulip and I
lay it at the edge of the barrier.

3249
02:19:59,333 --> 02:20:03,204
LIAM: (Gollum voice) Nasty.

3250
02:20:03,204 --> 02:20:05,198
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

3251
02:20:05,198 --> 02:20:07,178
(all laugh)

3252
02:20:07,249 --> 02:20:09,289
MATT: With disadvantage.

3253
02:20:09,289 --> 02:20:15,814
MARISHA: With disadvantage? Okay. Nine.

3254
02:20:15,814 --> 02:20:16,783
MATT: Okay, nine total?

3255
02:20:16,783 --> 02:20:17,539
LAURA: Oh no.

3256
02:20:17,539 --> 02:20:20,543
MARISHA: I'm not a very charismatic person.

3257
02:20:20,543 --> 02:20:23,830
MATT: It holds its place, and the voice again hits
your mind and says,

3258
02:20:23,830 --> 02:20:31,126
"How did you find me? What is your purpose here?"

3259
02:20:31,126 --> 02:20:32,115
ORION: I fly back down.

3260
02:20:32,115 --> 02:20:33,056
TRAVIS: No, no, no!

3261
02:20:33,056 --> 02:20:39,210
LAURA: We don't mean to disturb you, great sire.

3262
02:20:39,210 --> 02:20:41,654
MATT: "You will die if you try anything."

3263
02:20:41,654 --> 02:20:42,862
LAURA: We're not going to!

3264
02:20:42,862 --> 02:20:45,934
MATT: "I will not fall here, I will not die
here."

3265
02:20:45,934 --> 02:20:50,957
LAURA: We mean to help you! We mean to find our
way out, and find our friend. That's all.

3266
02:20:50,957 --> 02:20:53,606
MARISHA: We don't want to die either.

3267
02:20:53,606 --> 02:20:57,113
LAURA: Please. Who did this to you? We can help
you.

3268
02:20:57,113 --> 02:21:01,000
MARISHA: Let's not die together.

3269
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:07,042
MATT: You can see as you get a better look at it,
it definitely has a large scar across part of its

3270
02:21:07,042 --> 02:21:13,243
face, and it looks to be wearing remnants of a
robe similar to what Scanlan was describing.

3271
02:21:13,243 --> 02:21:22,689
However, it is tattered, it's dirtied, sullied by
the elements and god knows what other liquids. It

3272
02:21:22,751 --> 02:21:28,230
also has this strange kind of metallic skull cap
that's currently placed around its head.

3273
02:21:28,230 --> 02:21:45,337
And it just, "Leave me in peace, then, or give me
a reason not to slay you where you stand."

3274
02:21:45,411 --> 02:21:47,152
LIAM: (whispers) Revenge.

3275
02:21:47,152 --> 02:21:51,551
LAURA: We can help you get revenge against your
brethren who did this to you.

3276
02:21:51,551 --> 02:21:57,582
MATT: There's a slight change in mood, you just
feel. "Revenge?"

3277
02:21:57,582 --> 02:22:02,185
LAURA: Yes.

3278
02:22:02,185 --> 02:22:03,975
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

3279
02:22:03,975 --> 02:22:05,415
TRAVIS: Roll the shit out of that new dice.

3280
02:22:05,415 --> 02:22:09,379
MARISHA: Come on, Vex.

3281
02:22:09,379 --> 02:22:10,540
LAURA: 19?

3282
02:22:10,540 --> 02:22:19,615
ORION: Yes!

3283
02:22:19,615 --> 02:22:27,308
MATT: The barrier flickers and dissipates. It
reaches over and grabs what looks like a gnarled

3284
02:22:27,308 --> 02:22:32,538
stick. Pulls itself up onto its legs, now what
looked like a small minuscule creature is now,

3285
02:22:32,538 --> 02:22:39,162
even in his terrible hunched form, is standing
extremely tall, like scraping the top of this

3286
02:22:39,162 --> 02:22:44,294
maybe eight-foot-tall ceiling in this tunnel.

3287
02:22:44,294 --> 02:22:45,333
MARISHA: (meekly) Hi.

3288
02:22:45,333 --> 02:22:47,106
MATT: It takes a step forward and says,

3289
02:22:47,106 --> 02:22:58,467
"Revenge? You speak of revenge. This is a 
language I wish to know very well."

3290
02:22:58,467 --> 02:23:02,654
MARISHA: You found the right motley crew.

3291
02:23:02,654 --> 02:23:04,410
(all laugh)

3292
02:23:04,410 --> 02:23:07,545
LAURA: Should we bring it with us?

3293
02:23:07,545 --> 02:23:12,471
MARISHA: Would you like to come with us?

3294
02:23:12,471 --> 02:23:15,034
LAURA: To leave this cavern?

3295
02:23:15,034 --> 02:23:19,762
MARISHA: Meet our friends? We have friends.

3296
02:23:19,762 --> 02:23:23,477
MATT: It kind of gives you both a look and you
hear this-- There's a slight lurching to it as it

3297
02:23:23,477 --> 02:23:34,755
gives this horrible guttural-- (low chuckle)
"Friends? That's a word I haven't heard in a long

3298
02:23:34,755 --> 02:23:46,483
"time. Not one I take to heart, but allies, in
time, that I can understand.

3299
02:23:46,483 --> 02:23:50,366
"Take me to your allies."

3300
02:23:50,366 --> 02:23:51,945
LAURA: Tiberius?

3301
02:23:51,945 --> 02:23:52,978
ORION: Mm, yes?

3302
02:23:52,978 --> 02:23:55,648
LAURA: Maybe you can send that fucking carpet back
down.

3303
02:23:55,648 --> 02:23:57,178
(all laugh)

3304
02:23:57,178 --> 02:23:59,466
ORION: I'll be right there, I was trying to
get the rest of the party here, but everyone's

3305
02:23:59,466 --> 02:24:04,683
being buttholes. I fly back down with the carpet.

3306
02:24:04,683 --> 02:24:11,525
MATT: You come down with the carpet. At the
edge of this opening, you see Keyleth, you see

3307
02:24:11,525 --> 02:24:18,332
Vex, both emerge with a horrible tentacle-faced
gnarled being with a staff coming out with them.

3308
02:24:18,332 --> 02:24:19,882
ORION: Hello?

3309
02:24:19,882 --> 02:24:21,001
MARISHA: Tiberius--

3310
02:24:21,001 --> 02:24:22,426
ORION: Oh, did you make a friend?

3311
02:24:22,426 --> 02:24:23,830
MARISHA: We did! See! Friends!

3312
02:24:23,830 --> 02:24:24,773
ORION: Wonderful!

3313
02:24:24,773 --> 02:24:27,260
MARISHA: This is-- What's your name?

3314
02:24:27,260 --> 02:24:31,793
MATT: Looks about to you, then looks at Tiberius
and says, ignoring your question,

3315
02:24:31,793 --> 02:24:36,471
"You have persuasion to the arcane."

3316
02:24:36,471 --> 02:24:41,370
ORION: Yes, I'm a sorcerer! I do all kinds of fun
things with the arcane!

3317
02:24:41,370 --> 02:24:43,045
MATT: "We shall talk."

3318
02:24:43,045 --> 02:24:48,730
ORION: Very good, I'm always willing to learn.
Seems you are very powerful.

3319
02:24:48,730 --> 02:24:53,640
MATT: "My name... Clarota."

3320
02:24:53,640 --> 02:24:55,652
ALL: Clarota.

3321
02:24:55,652 --> 02:24:58,911
MARISHA: Can we call you Clarence for short?

3322
02:24:58,911 --> 02:25:00,015
MATT: "No!"

3323
02:25:00,015 --> 02:25:01,041
(all laugh)

3324
02:25:01,041 --> 02:25:02,886
MARISHA: Okay! Clar-ota

3325
02:25:02,886 --> 02:25:08,929
ALL: Clarota.

3326
02:25:08,929 --> 02:25:10,035
LIAM: Sounds Spanish.

3327
02:25:10,035 --> 02:25:14,523
LAURA: Please, join us on the carpet.

3328
02:25:14,523 --> 02:25:16,100
SAM: Can he fit on the carpet?

3329
02:25:16,100 --> 02:25:17,111
LIAM: He is very thin.

3330
02:25:17,111 --> 02:25:17,953
LAURA: She can fly.

3331
02:25:17,953 --> 02:25:20,033
MARISHA: I'll fly.

3332
02:25:20,033 --> 02:25:21,856
ORION: The rest of our allies are up.

3333
02:25:21,856 --> 02:25:26,170
MATT: He carefully steps on the carpet, once again
like its tentacles are (slithering noises).

3334
02:25:26,170 --> 02:25:27,301
LAURA: I keep a distance.

3335
02:25:27,301 --> 02:25:30,575
MATT: Moving around, its mouth and its eyes are
constantly darting, it looks extremely nervous and

3336
02:25:30,575 --> 02:25:35,222
almost like a cornered animal that's just barely
being coaxed onto this journey. You see with each

3337
02:25:35,222 --> 02:25:38,770
step it takes there a slight flicker of arcane
energy at the tip of its fingers, like it's just

3338
02:25:38,842 --> 02:25:44,875
prepared for anything to go terribly
wrong. It steps onto the carpet and goes,

3339
02:25:44,950 --> 02:25:48,333
"Take me to your allies."

3340
02:25:48,333 --> 02:25:50,748
ORION: Ah yes, we have wonderful allies!

3341
02:25:50,748 --> 02:25:54,524
MARISHA: You can even maybe call them friends,
even?

3342
02:25:54,524 --> 02:25:56,625
LAURA: Not just yet!

3343
02:25:56,625 --> 02:26:01,163
MATT: It crosses its legs and sits on the carpet,
holding its staff to its chest on the far corner

3344
02:26:01,221 --> 02:26:08,884
staring at all of you and says, "Go. Now."

3345
02:26:08,884 --> 02:26:10,819
LAURA: Hold on tight.

3346
02:26:10,819 --> 02:26:13,865
MATT: You guys make your way up to the top,
eventually you see the carpet (whoosh) over the

3347
02:26:13,938 --> 02:26:17,447
edge of the crevasse, come down to a rest, as your
party has now

3348
02:26:17,447 --> 02:26:19,813
brought with you the stuff of nightmares.

3349
02:26:19,813 --> 02:26:21,064
(all laugh)

3350
02:26:21,064 --> 02:26:22,897
SAM: That is the thing I saw in the village!

3351
02:26:22,897 --> 02:26:24,294
LAURA: Hold on! Hold on!

3352
02:26:24,294 --> 02:26:25,656
TRAVIS: What is that? Oh my god!

3353
02:26:25,656 --> 02:26:28,351
MATT: At which point, it's leapt off at this
point, hovering about and you can see this crackle

3354
02:26:28,351 --> 02:26:30,830
of fire in its hand and it goes, (panicked
noises)

3355
02:26:30,830 --> 02:26:31,835
LAURA: No! No!

3356
02:26:31,835 --> 02:26:34,190
ORION: I'm standing between them, like, it's okay!
These are the allies we speak of!

3357
02:26:34,190 --> 02:26:36,247
LAURA: Peace, friends! We are ourselves!

3358
02:26:36,429 --> 02:26:37,603
ORION: Grog, don't do anything!

3359
02:26:37,603 --> 02:26:38,957
LAURA: We are not controlled.

3360
02:26:38,957 --> 02:26:43,112
ORION: Don't use a whip, Scanlan, sing a
friendly song as he is our friend-- ally. To the

3361
02:26:43,112 --> 02:26:49,049
guy. Ally. He is-- He's in a little spot of
trouble and we are going to

3362
02:26:49,049 --> 02:26:53,882
help him get revenge, or something of the sort.

3363
02:26:53,882 --> 02:26:56,357
SAM: He's a friend? Help--

3364
02:26:56,357 --> 02:26:57,777
ORION: He prefers--

3365
02:26:57,777 --> 02:26:58,865
MATT: "Ally."

3366
02:26:58,865 --> 02:26:59,622
LAURA: Ally.

3367
02:26:59,622 --> 02:27:00,354
SAM: Ally.

3368
02:27:00,354 --> 02:27:01,111
MARISHA: Ally.

3369
02:27:01,111 --> 02:27:01,800
SAM: Ally.

3370
02:27:01,800 --> 02:27:02,558
TALIESIN: Ally?

3371
02:27:02,558 --> 02:27:04,910
TRAVIS: What's on your head?

3372
02:27:04,910 --> 02:27:11,522
MATT: He kind of gives you this keen look of,
huh,

3373
02:27:11,721 --> 02:27:13,983
the least person I expected to ask a question.

3374
02:27:13,983 --> 02:27:16,586
(all laugh)

3375
02:27:16,666 --> 02:27:27,286
MATT: It kind of hobbles forward with its gnarled
staff, and says, "I was cast out from my hive. I

3376
02:27:27,286 --> 02:27:45,117
"was cursed with the mark of the arcane. My people
see that as an ill omen. I was discarded, left to die."

3377
02:27:45,117 --> 02:27:47,767
LAURA: Let's destroy your hive.

3378
02:27:47,767 --> 02:27:48,674
MATT: "No."

3379
02:27:48,674 --> 02:27:49,550
LAURA: No?

3380
02:27:49,550 --> 02:27:59,202
MATT: "You see, the hive is sick. The mind that
keeps us safe is no longer its own."

3381
02:27:59,202 --> 02:28:00,175
ORION: Oh?

3382
02:28:00,175 --> 02:28:11,153
MATT: "One, an alien one, has come and taken the
mind hostage, it has taken my people as its own

3383
02:28:11,153 --> 02:28:19,510
"playthings. I was able to escape its mental
grasp."

3384
02:28:19,510 --> 02:28:22,116
It reaches up and taps the metal on its head.

3385
02:28:22,116 --> 02:28:24,061
LAURA: Oh! Tinfoil hat!

3386
02:28:24,061 --> 02:28:26,694
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Magneto helmet!

3387
02:28:26,694 --> 02:28:28,740
MARISHA: This is the guy we've needed this whole
time!

3388
02:28:28,740 --> 02:28:36,231
MATT: "My people will not so easily escape its
grasp,

3389
02:28:36,231 --> 02:28:43,654
"they are now under the control of this creature."

3390
02:28:43,654 --> 02:28:44,569
MARISHA: So if we did it--

3391
02:28:44,569 --> 02:28:48,251
SAM: If we find this creature, we might be able to
free your hive as well.

3392
02:28:48,251 --> 02:28:55,661
MATT: "That would be why I wish to have your
alliance."

3393
02:28:55,661 --> 02:28:56,270
LAURA: Yes.

3394
02:28:56,270 --> 02:29:02,905
MATT: "Help me free our hivemind, free my
people."

3395
02:29:02,905 --> 02:29:05,076
TRAVIS: (whispers) Sense motive.

3396
02:29:05,076 --> 02:29:06,820
LAURA: Oh yeah, can we sense motive on him?

3397
02:29:06,820 --> 02:29:09,563
MATT: (laughs) You definitely can!

3398
02:29:09,563 --> 02:29:10,507
LAURA: Oh gosh.

3399
02:29:10,507 --> 02:29:11,533
TRAVIS: I would do it, but--

3400
02:29:11,533 --> 02:29:13,204
MARISHA: We should also have him help us in
your--

3401
02:29:13,204 --> 02:29:15,019
MATT: I would put this in a group sense motive
right now.

3402
02:29:15,019 --> 02:29:15,977
TALIESIN: Yeah! All right!

3403
02:29:15,977 --> 02:29:17,003
MATT: Everyone roll!

3404
02:29:17,003 --> 02:29:17,841
ORION: I rolled 14.

3405
02:29:17,841 --> 02:29:19,485
LAURA: I rolled-- what do we add to it?

3406
02:29:19,485 --> 02:29:24,324
MATT: Sense motive in this would be your insight,
sorry. Pathfinder to Fifth Edition!

3407
02:29:24,324 --> 02:29:25,434
LAURA: Insight? 24.

3408
02:29:25,434 --> 02:29:26,267
MARISHA: 18?

3409
02:29:26,267 --> 02:29:26,992
TRAVIS: 16.

3410
02:29:26,992 --> 02:29:27,708
ORION: 14.

3411
02:29:27,708 --> 02:29:28,513
TALIESIN: Natural one.

3412
02:29:28,513 --> 02:29:29,367
LAURA: (laughs) Four?

3413
02:29:29,367 --> 02:29:30,230
LIAM: Four.

3414
02:29:30,230 --> 02:29:31,044
TRAVIS: 16!

3415
02:29:31,044 --> 02:29:31,703
SAM: 13.

3416
02:29:31,703 --> 02:29:32,876
TRAVIS: (happy scream) 16!

3417
02:29:32,876 --> 02:29:33,936
(all laugh)

3418
02:29:33,936 --> 02:29:35,301
MATT: Okay!

3419
02:29:35,301 --> 02:29:36,350
SAM: You're a people person!

3420
02:29:36,350 --> 02:29:44,268
MATT: Through your intense grasping this
creature's disposition, best you can, as alien and

3421
02:29:44,268 --> 02:29:49,946
unfamiliar as its mannerisms and speech and
interests may be, you get the feeling that it's

3422
02:29:50,007 --> 02:29:53,973
speaking out of desperation and it's speaking out
of genuine interest. You've piqued it with the hint

3423
02:29:53,973 --> 02:29:59,732
of revenge, you've piqued it with the idea of
alliance as opposed to being alone. You get the

3424
02:29:59,799 --> 02:30:04,411
feeling that it speaks the truth. It genuinely is
asking for your help in freeing its people from

3425
02:30:04,411 --> 02:30:09,075
whatever is influencing their current actions.

3426
02:30:09,075 --> 02:30:10,986
LAURA: Clarota... (laughs)

3427
02:30:10,986 --> 02:30:11,888
SAM: What's his name?

3428
02:30:11,888 --> 02:30:12,798
LAURA: Cla-ro-ta?

3429
02:30:12,798 --> 02:30:13,621
MATT: Clarota.

3430
02:30:13,621 --> 02:30:14,865
SAM: Can we just call him Clarence?

3431
02:30:14,865 --> 02:30:16,169
(all laugh)

3432
02:30:16,169 --> 02:30:18,160
LIAM: (Jimmy Stewart voice) Clarence, Clarence!

3433
02:30:18,160 --> 02:30:20,281
TALIESIN: Clara. It could be a she.

3434
02:30:20,281 --> 02:30:27,903
LAURA: We are very interested in being allies with
you. Might we have your word that upon defeating

3435
02:30:27,903 --> 02:30:31,125
this creature, we will be safe?

3436
02:30:31,125 --> 02:30:38,606
SAM: And as a symbol of our dedication to you, I'd
love to play you just a little bit of a song that

3437
02:30:38,606 --> 02:30:44,402
might heal some of those wounds and scrapes that
you seem to have all over your body.

3438
02:30:44,402 --> 02:30:47,954
MATT: He gives you the dirtiest look you've ever
received.

3439
02:30:47,954 --> 02:30:50,198
TRAVIS: (whispers) It was because of the arcane!

3440
02:30:50,198 --> 02:30:55,602
SAM: It's a pretty good song!

3441
02:30:55,602 --> 02:30:56,883
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

3442
02:30:56,883 --> 02:30:58,935
(all laugh)

3443
02:30:58,935 --> 02:31:00,683
LIAM: Come on, Burt Reynolds!

3444
02:31:00,683 --> 02:31:02,090
SAM: Hm. Ooh! 17.

3445
02:31:02,090 --> 02:31:05,755
(all laugh)

3446
02:31:05,755 --> 02:31:09,694
MATT: He takes a sudden step forward towards you,
his tentacles-- (slithering noises)

3447
02:31:09,694 --> 02:31:13,351
LAURA: Ew, ugh!

3448
02:31:13,351 --> 02:31:16,329
MATT: "Play this song."

3449
02:31:16,329 --> 02:31:18,048
TRAVIS: Break out the--

3450
02:31:18,048 --> 02:31:20,544
LAURA: It better be good!

3451
02:31:20,544 --> 02:31:28,857
SAM: (sings) When I get that feeling, I want
Clarota healing. Clarota healing is something

3452
02:31:28,857 --> 02:31:42,634
that's good for you. Ooh ooh ooh. (sings
embellished melisma)

3453
02:31:42,634 --> 02:31:44,157
LAURA: Clarota's dancing, I can see it!

3454
02:31:44,157 --> 02:31:46,024
MATT: Make a persuasion check-- no, a performance
check.

3455
02:31:46,024 --> 02:31:49,868
SAM: A performance check!

3456
02:31:49,948 --> 02:31:50,924
18!

3457
02:31:50,924 --> 02:31:52,029
MATT: 18.

3458
02:31:52,029 --> 02:31:56,157
(all laugh)

3459
02:31:56,157 --> 02:32:02,112
MATT: In spite of itself, it stands there still
glaring at you, but out of the corner of your eye

3460
02:32:02,112 --> 02:32:04,251
you swear you see its toe tapping.

3461
02:32:04,251 --> 02:32:08,123
(all laugh)

3462
02:32:08,123 --> 02:32:14,173
MATT: It then kind of-- its tentacles withdraw in
such a way that gets you kind of off-put and the

3463
02:32:14,173 --> 02:32:28,626
song comes to a halt. "I'd not heard a song. I
shall call upon you for more in the future."

3464
02:32:28,626 --> 02:32:29,873
LAURA: Oh!

3465
02:32:29,873 --> 02:32:33,347
SAM: There's many more where that came from!

3466
02:32:33,410 --> 02:32:44,130
MATT: "Now we talk about how we can kill
K'varn."

3467
02:32:44,189 --> 02:32:45,281
LAURA: K'varn!

3468
02:32:45,281 --> 02:32:46,817
LAURA and SAM: Yes!

3469
02:32:46,817 --> 02:32:48,436
MARISHA: Yes! Let's talk about that.

3470
02:32:48,436 --> 02:32:49,478
SAM: End scene!

3471
02:32:49,478 --> 02:32:51,260
MATT: And that's where we're going to go ahead and
end it for today, guys.

3472
02:32:51,260 --> 02:32:54,774
(all cheer)

3473
02:32:54,774 --> 02:32:58,651
MATT: That went very interestingly! We'll pick up
from that point.

3474
02:32:58,651 --> 02:33:00,055
MARISHA: Sorry we had to rebel, you guys.

3475
02:33:00,055 --> 02:33:01,550
LAURA: Yeah sorry about that, you guys. Sorry!

3476
02:33:01,550 --> 02:33:03,008
MARISHA: Sorry! It was for a good cause!

3477
02:33:03,008 --> 02:33:06,005
LIAM: Thank you for rebelling, and staking out on
your own!

3478
02:33:06,005 --> 02:33:12,130
MATT: You've acquired for the moment a very
curious ally. Yeah, this will be an interesting

3479
02:33:12,130 --> 02:33:13,649
branching point for next week.

3480
02:33:13,649 --> 02:33:14,775
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

3481
02:33:14,775 --> 02:33:15,792
TRAVIS: We should get some damn hats.

3482
02:33:15,792 --> 02:33:17,322
LAURA: I know! We should get him to make us hats!

3483
02:33:17,322 --> 02:33:19,908
MARISHA: We definitely need one for Grog. We have
to get him to make us hats for Grog.

3484
02:33:19,908 --> 02:33:20,905
TRAVIS: Why me?

3485
02:33:20,905 --> 02:33:28,836
MATT: (laughs) I hope you guys enjoyed that! No
combat. You guys avoided quite a few possibilities

3486
02:33:28,836 --> 02:33:33,391
for battle and that makes for an interesting
dynamic. So well done!

3487
02:33:33,391 --> 02:33:35,345
You've killed a crap ton of duergar.

3488
02:33:35,403 --> 02:33:36,294
LIAM: Trolls.

3489
02:33:36,294 --> 02:33:38,914
MATT: And a couple trolls and an ogre, by sending
them off a cliff!

3490
02:33:38,914 --> 02:33:41,589
It was a pretty eventful evening!

3491
02:33:41,589 --> 02:33:43,403
MARISHA: Yeah.

3492
02:33:43,403 --> 02:33:46,585
MATT: So yeah, so guys, thank you so much for
watching! Also, as a reminder, there is Dwarven

3493
02:33:46,585 --> 02:33:51,213
Forge that's been doing an amazing kickstarter for
its next set. I was a supporter for all of Dwarven

3494
02:33:51,213 --> 02:33:54,732
Forge's kickstarters and I'm looking forward to
being able to break out some of those dungeon

3495
02:33:54,732 --> 02:33:59,227
tiles in this game in the near future. But if you
haven't checked it out yet, I recommend it! Go and

3496
02:33:59,227 --> 02:34:02,450
see if you can back it. Those guys are awesome,
the quality of their work is great! All of you DMs

3497
02:34:02,450 --> 02:34:08,093
out there that wanna run some seriously legit
dungeon setups for your miniatures and battle

3498
02:34:08,093 --> 02:34:12,525
circumstances, it's highly recommended. So go
check that out. I know I've already backed it, so

3499
02:34:12,525 --> 02:34:17,884
come join me! And (evil voice) one of us, one of
us! Anyway, does anyone else have something they

3500
02:34:17,884 --> 02:34:19,648
wanna talk about for the evening, guys?

3501
02:34:19,648 --> 02:34:20,426
ZAC: I do.

3502
02:34:20,426 --> 02:34:21,764
MATT: Zac! What's up, buddy?

3503
02:34:21,764 --> 02:34:26,281
ZAC: Thanks for tuning in, guys. I wanted to bring
up International Tabletop Day.

3504
02:34:26,343 --> 02:34:27,861
MATT: Yes! Yes! Let's do that!

3505
02:34:27,861 --> 02:34:34,422
ZAC: It's coming up on April 11th. We're going to
be live-streaming Tabletop Day from here in this

3506
02:34:34,422 --> 02:34:41,770
studio. Probably not as complicated a setup as
this, but similar of a set up. For those of you

3507
02:34:41,770 --> 02:34:49,001
that have not registered yet for International
Tabletop Day, go to the website tabletopday.com or

3508
02:34:49,062 --> 02:34:52,557
org, I could be saying it wrong, the chat room
will let you know.

3509
02:34:52,557 --> 02:34:53,503
MARISHA: Just google it.

3510
02:34:53,503 --> 02:34:54,402
ZAC: Google it!

3511
02:34:54,402 --> 02:34:55,861
MATT: Angelfire.tabletopday.com

3512
02:34:55,861 --> 02:34:59,576
ZAC: I knew you were testing my knowledge! You're
saying it wrong, you're saying it wrong. I'm not

3513
02:34:59,576 --> 02:35:05,278
an actor, dammit! So go check that out. We're
still looking for a lot of countries to have

3514
02:35:05,278 --> 02:35:11,253
representation, so if you're overseas, go to the
website, let your local retailers know about it,

3515
02:35:11,253 --> 02:35:16,289
sign up, and get in on the fun! It's going to be a
blast. We're going to have this whole building

3516
02:35:16,289 --> 02:35:20,704
stacked to the brim with people! Board games, live
streaming the whole thing.

3517
02:35:20,704 --> 02:35:22,530
Get in on it. It's going to be a lot of fun!

3518
02:35:22,530 --> 02:35:23,731
MATT: Yeah, do it!

3519
02:35:23,731 --> 02:35:26,661
ZAC: So I think that's pretty much it, thanks so
much guys.

3520
02:35:26,661 --> 02:35:30,349
MATT: Yeah, no worries, I think next week we're
gonna try and do a Q&amp;A after the game. So we'll

3521
02:35:30,349 --> 02:35:31,789
stay for an hour or more after.

3522
02:35:31,789 --> 02:35:32,825
ZAC: Subs only!

3523
02:35:32,825 --> 02:35:33,920
MATT: Subs only! You get to hang out.

3524
02:35:33,920 --> 02:35:37,329
ZAC: Subs only, so if you want to ask questions
