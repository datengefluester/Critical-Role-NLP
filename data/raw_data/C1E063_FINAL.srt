1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,386
(laughing)

2
00:00:01,386 --> 00:00:08,805
MATT: And welcome back to tonight's episode.
So, picking up where we left off, Vox Machina,

3
00:00:08,805 --> 00:00:14,475
having to find and collect the artifacts known as
the Vestiges of Divergence to prepare themselves

4
00:00:14,475 --> 00:00:19,967
for battle against the Chroma Conclave, a group of
extremely dangerous chromatic dragons who are

5
00:00:19,967 --> 00:00:26,935
wreaking havoc on the Tal'Dorei countryside,
and get vengeance for the loss of Vex and Vax's

6
00:00:26,935 --> 00:00:30,888
father in the past. Er, sorry, mother. The
father's still around, and kind of a dick.

7
00:00:30,971 --> 00:00:31,833
LAURA: Yeah.

8
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:37,118
MATT: It's been a long week. However, you guys
have been making your way into the Feywild in

9
00:00:37,118 --> 00:00:43,313
search of a specific item known as Fenthras,
a bow of which Vex has been sort of keeping an

10
00:00:43,313 --> 00:00:44,415
eye on this whole time.

11
00:00:44,415 --> 00:00:45,639
LAURA: Ahh, totally.

12
00:00:45,639 --> 00:00:53,192
MATT: Just like that. (laughs) We're all having
Gen Con plague residual, here. They've made their

13
00:00:53,192 --> 00:00:57,976
way through a number of strange, dangerous,
and awkward encounters in the Feywild, including

14
00:00:57,976 --> 00:01:01,226
an encounter with their father, I meant to say
earlier, in Syngorn, which is currently hiding out

15
00:01:01,226 --> 00:01:05,954
in the Feywild until they've prepared for battle
against Thordak the Cinder King. You went to the

16
00:01:05,954 --> 00:01:11,987
Moonbrush and parleyed between pixies and
werewolves, you pushed past the Gilded Run,

17
00:01:11,987 --> 00:01:16,638
a series of enchanted, dangerous rivers that keep
the Shademirk Bog in check from spreading across

18
00:01:16,857 --> 00:01:22,037
the land with its corruption, and you stepped into
the Shademirk Bog, its strange, sludgey, black,

19
00:01:22,037 --> 00:01:29,187
corrupt interior, stumbling upon what appears to
be a small hovel built out of a tree trunk.

20
00:01:29,187 --> 00:01:35,778
The gnomes, making their way towards via Vex's
broom, caught a partial glimpse of the creature

21
00:01:35,778 --> 00:01:40,314
that lived within, a door was suddenly opened,
and upon floating back, the broom was robbed of

22
00:01:40,314 --> 00:01:46,539
its magical enchantment temporarily. The party
regathered and are now deciding what to do here in

23
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:51,480
the depths of the Shademirk Bog. So, as the gnomes
have returned, your broom has seemingly been

24
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,116
proven to still function--

25
00:01:53,116 --> 00:01:54,773
LAURA: Don't say 'seemingly'.

26
00:01:54,773 --> 00:01:55,433
MATT: Why? It's fun.

27
00:01:55,433 --> 00:01:56,005
LAURA: Don't say 'seemingly'.

28
00:01:56,005 --> 00:01:56,927
MATT: It's fun.

29
00:01:56,927 --> 00:01:57,946
MARISHA: We confirmed.

30
00:01:57,946 --> 00:01:59,144
LAURA: Yeah.

31
00:01:59,144 --> 00:02:00,597
MATT: What would you guys like to do?

32
00:02:00,597 --> 00:02:03,763
SAM: All right, so that place over there,
the hut.

33
00:02:03,763 --> 00:02:05,174
LAURA: Yeah.

34
00:02:05,174 --> 00:02:09,062
SAM: I think it was not a good idea to go over
there. I think it's one of the things that

35
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:10,942
what's-his-fuck warned us about.

36
00:02:10,942 --> 00:02:11,775
LAURA: Garmelie?

37
00:02:11,775 --> 00:02:12,391
SAM: Yes.

38
00:02:12,391 --> 00:02:13,506
LAURA: The hag, right?

39
00:02:13,506 --> 00:02:15,187
SAM: I don't know. I wasn't really paying
attention.

40
00:02:15,187 --> 00:02:16,484
LAURA: Yeah, no, he warned us about...

41
00:02:16,484 --> 00:02:18,507
TALIESIN: I'm feeling the hag. Is anybody else
feeling the hag?

42
00:02:18,507 --> 00:02:19,446
SAM: Something about a hut.

43
00:02:19,446 --> 00:02:20,651
LAURA: I am not feeling the hag.

44
00:02:20,651 --> 00:02:22,075
LIAM: I'm not feeling the hag.

45
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:23,573
MARISHA: How do you mean? Yeah, how do you mean,
feeling?

46
00:02:23,573 --> 00:02:24,699
LIAM: I've had enough hag.

47
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:26,042
TALIESIN: We're not feeling the hag, but I think
we should avoid her.

48
00:02:26,042 --> 00:02:28,246
LAURA: The Hut of Wodenna.

49
00:02:28,246 --> 00:02:29,606
MARISHA: The Hut of Wodenna, right.

50
00:02:29,606 --> 00:02:30,806
SAM: Yeah, that's probably Wodenna.

51
00:02:30,806 --> 00:02:31,977
LAURA: It could be.

52
00:02:31,977 --> 00:02:37,005
SAM: So why don't we go around the hut? Is that
possible? Is Garmelie gone?

53
00:02:37,005 --> 00:02:37,755
LAURA: Garmelie's gone.

54
00:02:37,755 --> 00:02:39,000
MATT: Garmelie left, you guys.

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,693
SAM: Oh yeah.

56
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:40,251
TRAVIS: Peaced out.

57
00:02:40,251 --> 00:02:41,072
MATT: He wouldn't even enter the forest with you.

58
00:02:41,072 --> 00:02:43,151
LAURA: However, she is aware of our presence, now,
isn't she?

59
00:02:43,151 --> 00:02:45,586
SAM: So? We're big and scary. She's a little old
lady.

60
00:02:45,586 --> 00:02:50,012
LIAM: What's the terrain like around this hut?

61
00:02:50,012 --> 00:02:56,649
MATT: The forests of the Shademirk Bog is a very
very thickly wooded swamp with thick-trunked trees

62
00:02:56,718 --> 00:03:05,332
and almost weeping willow-type sagging canopies,
but the entirety of each piece of brush here is

63
00:03:05,332 --> 00:03:11,942
coated and seemingly seeping this kind of black
sticky tar-like ichor that just kind of pools and

64
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:17,977
seeps into the ground, so even traversing this
territory's been a slow, arduous process.

65
00:03:17,977 --> 00:03:26,163
There is a small clearing around where this tree
trunk hovel is currently located, and the tree

66
00:03:26,163 --> 00:03:30,591
itself does not appear to match the surrounding
trees

67
00:03:30,591 --> 00:03:33,811
that kind of embody most of this forest
terrain.

68
00:03:33,811 --> 00:03:36,700
LIAM: Does it look possible to skirt around it
from where we are?

69
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,507
MATT: You could skirt around it, most definitely,
yeah. It's just something you saw in the distance

70
00:03:39,507 --> 00:03:41,075
and went and inspected, you could avoid it
entirely.

71
00:03:41,075 --> 00:03:41,973
LIAM: Okay.

72
00:03:41,973 --> 00:03:43,458
TALIESIN: And we do have a direction to move.

73
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:46,935
LAURA: Yeah, we know, we know that is not where
the bow is.

74
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:50,219
MARISHA: Yes, it was on Garmelie's list of things
to avoid.

75
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:52,495
SAM: But maybe she could help us in a way.

76
00:03:52,495 --> 00:03:56,501
LAURA: I know, it's so terrible! I want to like
explore everything here because--

77
00:03:56,501 --> 00:03:59,732
MARISHA: I wonder if she knows the other hags that
we've encountered.

78
00:03:59,732 --> 00:04:00,789
LAURA: Forsythia...

79
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:05,423
SAM: It's like that urge when you're standing at
the edge of a cliff, like part of your body wants

80
00:04:05,423 --> 00:04:06,805
to jump a little bit?

81
00:04:06,805 --> 00:04:07,499
LAURA: Yeah.

82
00:04:07,499 --> 00:04:08,522
SAM: I kinda wanna go in there.

83
00:04:08,522 --> 00:04:09,629
LAURA: Kind of like when I dove into the river.

84
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:10,255
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

85
00:04:10,255 --> 00:04:11,163
MATT: Yeah, exactly.

86
00:04:11,163 --> 00:04:14,172
MARISHA: Well, see, you guys did kind of jump,
and it didn't feel good, right?

87
00:04:14,172 --> 00:04:14,976
LAURA: Right, true.

88
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,806
TRAVIS: Devil's advocate.

89
00:04:15,806 --> 00:04:16,814
MARISHA: So...

90
00:04:16,814 --> 00:04:22,970
TRAVIS: What if she's lonely, and two, what if
she's not the hag and she knows where the hag is?

91
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:28,219
MARISHA: One, I'm certain she is lonely, and two,
she's probably the hag.

92
00:04:28,219 --> 00:04:29,687
TALIESIN: I'm pretty sure she's the hag.

93
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:31,138
MARISHA: She's definitely probably the hag.

94
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:35,542
LIAM: We've kind of already had this conversation
before we went and poked a badger with those

95
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:39,013
floating instruments, we really don't need to do
every single thing.

96
00:04:39,013 --> 00:04:40,516
LAURA: No, we don't, we really don't.

97
00:04:40,516 --> 00:04:41,856
TRAVIS: I'm just saying you're profiling, is all.

98
00:04:41,856 --> 00:04:43,820
LIAM: And I have a bad history with hags,
and I would like--

99
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,908
LAURA: Yes, you do.

100
00:04:44,908 --> 00:04:46,362
LIAM: --to skip this fucking place.

101
00:04:46,362 --> 00:04:51,038
TALIESIN: I'm okay with that. I, honestly I could
use a bit of sleep at some point and I think

102
00:04:51,038 --> 00:04:54,245
moving in the correct direction, getting a bit of
sleep somewhere safe...

103
00:04:54,245 --> 00:04:57,645
LAURA: And we've been do-si-doing the whole time
we've been having this conversation, definitely.

104
00:04:57,645 --> 00:04:59,414
TALIESIN: I'm working on that as well.

105
00:04:59,414 --> 00:05:01,178
MARISHA: I feel like we're trying to talk
ourselves out of this, aren't we?

106
00:05:01,178 --> 00:05:03,431
LAURA: I think we need to not go towards the hut.

107
00:05:03,431 --> 00:05:05,437
MARISHA: Okay, we'll not go towards the hut.

108
00:05:05,437 --> 00:05:06,682
LAURA: To the tree, to scariness.

109
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:08,519
TALIESIN: If there was a time to not be us,
this is the moment.

110
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,153
MARISHA: It's probably now.

111
00:05:09,153 --> 00:05:10,196
LAURA: This is that time.

112
00:05:10,196 --> 00:05:10,928
TALIESIN: Right now.

113
00:05:10,928 --> 00:05:11,744
TRAVIS: I take out the javelin of lightning.

114
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:12,635
ALL: No!

115
00:05:12,635 --> 00:05:15,090
SAM: You have a javelin of lightning?

116
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:15,733
LAURA: He does.

117
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:16,743
TRAVIS: I do.

118
00:05:16,743 --> 00:05:17,729
TALIESIN: He does, in fact, have a javelin of
lightning.

119
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:18,820
SAM: Why have you never used a javelin of
lightning?

120
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,467
LAURA: He has, he has one time. Don't.

121
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:22,726
TRAVIS: And I, I just make sure that it's clean
and put it back.

122
00:05:22,726 --> 00:05:23,825
MATT: Okay.

123
00:05:23,825 --> 00:05:30,552
LAURA: Let's just sneakily go off and just not pay
any more attention to this charming little tree.

124
00:05:30,552 --> 00:05:31,666
MARISHA: Okay.

125
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,891
TALIESIN: I feel like we've done enough damage for
one day.

126
00:05:33,891 --> 00:05:36,231
TRAVIS: Yeah, we've gotta at least come back this
way, so, you know.

127
00:05:36,231 --> 00:05:38,097
LAURA: This is true. Ugh.

128
00:05:38,097 --> 00:05:40,105
MATT: All righty. You guys--

129
00:05:40,105 --> 00:05:41,895
TRAVIS: We go around. Stealthily.

130
00:05:41,895 --> 00:05:45,513
LAURA: Stealthily walk away from the hut.

131
00:05:45,513 --> 00:05:47,831
TRAVIS: Do we still have Pass Without a Trace?

132
00:05:47,831 --> 00:05:50,216
LAURA: Do we still have Pass Without a Trace
going, or do I need--no, it dropped, it dropped.

133
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:51,732
MATT: You traveled quite a while, yeah.

134
00:05:51,732 --> 00:05:57,426
LAURA: Because we fought something, so I would
need to cast it again. Which I do! Cast again.

135
00:05:57,426 --> 00:05:58,808
Pass Without a Trace.

136
00:05:58,808 --> 00:06:00,165
SAM: Thank you!

137
00:06:00,165 --> 00:06:02,553
LAURA: Um, maybe Dust of Tracelessness behind us
so the hag

138
00:06:02,553 --> 00:06:04,756
doesn't feel tempted to maybe follow in
our footsteps.

139
00:06:04,756 --> 00:06:07,304
TRAVIS: Don't tell me what to do, devil-woman.

140
00:06:07,304 --> 00:06:11,922
TRAVIS: I take out the Dust of Tracelessness.
It looks good, I put it back.

141
00:06:11,922 --> 00:06:14,995
LAURA: Grog, please, flower-girl, please.

142
00:06:14,995 --> 00:06:22,152
TRAVIS: Javelin or Dust of Tracelessness,
they go together. If I do one, I do the other.

143
00:06:22,152 --> 00:06:23,548
LAURA: You're terrible. That's terrible.

144
00:06:23,548 --> 00:06:26,063
TRAVIS: I need a little danger in my life.

145
00:06:26,063 --> 00:06:28,467
TALIESIN: I promise you, we're going to kill
something very soon.

146
00:06:28,467 --> 00:06:29,566
LAURA: Soon!

147
00:06:29,566 --> 00:06:30,902
TRAVIS: There's a giant werewolf following us...

148
00:06:30,902 --> 00:06:33,391
LAURA: We just killed the crocodile plant.
We just killed a crocodile plant.

149
00:06:33,391 --> 00:06:34,397
MARISHA: That's true.

150
00:06:34,397 --> 00:06:35,992
LAURA: Seriously, we just fought something.

151
00:06:35,992 --> 00:06:38,055
MARISHA: You were inside his gut. You have to
remember that.

152
00:06:38,055 --> 00:06:39,280
LAURA: Just did that.

153
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,674
TRAVIS: I didn't really hit it that much,
it was very unsatisfying.

154
00:06:40,674 --> 00:06:42,488
(All laugh.)

155
00:06:42,488 --> 00:06:44,718
LAURA: Let's walk away.

156
00:06:44,718 --> 00:06:46,152
LAURA: I wanna stealth.

157
00:06:46,152 --> 00:06:48,739
MATT: All right. Everyone make a stealth check.

158
00:06:48,739 --> 00:06:50,735
MARISHA: All right. New d20.

159
00:06:50,735 --> 00:06:52,515
LAURA: Oh, high hopes!

160
00:06:52,515 --> 00:06:54,440
TRAVIS: Did you say Pass Without a Trace?

161
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,328
LAURA: Pass Without a Trace, I cast Pass Without a
Trace.

162
00:06:56,328 --> 00:06:57,594
TALIESIN: Huh. That's weird.

163
00:06:57,594 --> 00:06:59,613
MARISHA: That's a dick move. That is a--

164
00:06:59,613 --> 00:07:00,605
TALIESIN: That's weird.

165
00:07:00,605 --> 00:07:01,999
LAURA: Did you get a 20, did you get a 20 on it?

166
00:07:01,999 --> 00:07:02,664
TALIESIN: I got a 19.

167
00:07:02,664 --> 00:07:03,456
LAURA: Aw.

168
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:05,164
MARISHA: He got a 19 and I got a three.

169
00:07:05,164 --> 00:07:05,938
LAURA: Oh, come on.

170
00:07:05,938 --> 00:07:07,002
(All laugh.)

171
00:07:07,002 --> 00:07:08,603
LAURA: That's just not cool.

172
00:07:08,603 --> 00:07:09,452
MATT: That's actually pretty funny.

173
00:07:09,452 --> 00:07:10,649
SAM: That's one better than before!

174
00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:11,496
MATT: Yeah.

175
00:07:11,496 --> 00:07:12,553
LIAM: Are these new opal dice?

176
00:07:12,553 --> 00:07:13,270
MARISHA: It's a step in the right direction.

177
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,083
LAURA: They are.

178
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,013
TRAVIS: They switched, yeah.

179
00:07:15,013 --> 00:07:15,965
SAM: New dice.

180
00:07:15,965 --> 00:07:17,861
LAURA: There's no excuse now.

181
00:07:17,861 --> 00:07:18,846
MATT: All right, so.

182
00:07:18,846 --> 00:07:20,362
LAURA: I think it's just a curse on you, Marisha.

183
00:07:20,362 --> 00:07:21,083
MATT: Stealth.

184
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:21,593
TRAVIS: 25.

185
00:07:21,593 --> 00:07:23,072
MATT: 25. Vax?

186
00:07:23,072 --> 00:07:24,295
LIAM: Did we use the Dust of Tracelessness?

187
00:07:24,295 --> 00:07:26,412
LAURA: No, we used Pass Without a Trace, though,
so add ten.

188
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:29,017
LIAM: No? Well, I will settle for a 27.

189
00:07:29,017 --> 00:07:30,741
MATT: Okay, with a plus ten?

190
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:31,973
LIAM: No, I, didn't we use--

191
00:07:31,973 --> 00:07:33,170
LAURA and TRAVIS: Pass Without a Trace.

192
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,544
MATT: Pass Without a Trace was used.

193
00:07:34,544 --> 00:07:35,539
LIAM: I just, oh, all right.

194
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:36,600
LAURA and MATT: You said Dust of Tracelessness.

195
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,209
LIAM: Oh, 37.

196
00:07:37,209 --> 00:07:39,125
MATT: Lotta traces going on, it's fine. Plus ten
added, so 37.

197
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:39,837
LAURA: 36.

198
00:07:39,837 --> 00:07:40,595
MATT: 36.

199
00:07:40,595 --> 00:07:41,414
MARISHA: 20.

200
00:07:41,414 --> 00:07:42,305
TALIESIN: 35.

201
00:07:42,305 --> 00:07:43,562
SAM: 30.

202
00:07:43,562 --> 00:07:44,818
MATT: All right, and Pike...

203
00:07:44,818 --> 00:07:45,813
LAURA: Pike!

204
00:07:45,813 --> 00:07:46,617
MATT: All right.

205
00:07:46,617 --> 00:07:47,976
(All laugh.)

206
00:07:47,976 --> 00:07:53,867
MATT: Ehhh, natural three. It's okay. You guys
make your way around the outskirts of this kind of

207
00:07:53,867 --> 00:08:00,702
open glade area, scooting by. As you begin to
separate, finally getting to a point where the

208
00:08:00,702 --> 00:08:08,877
direction you're trying to head, where you noticed
seemingly all the liquid that's seeping from,

209
00:08:08,877 --> 00:08:15,035
the actual movement, momentum of the horrible
black material was like pushing slowly outward

210
00:08:15,035 --> 00:08:21,070
from apparently some center place? You follow that
slow flow best you can. As you begin to pull away,

211
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:26,500
you hear a slight creak sound in the distance.
(creaking)

212
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,596
LAURA: No. Can we see if the door shut?

213
00:08:28,596 --> 00:08:29,690
TRAVIS: Hide! I hide.

214
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:30,555
LAURA: Did the door shut?

215
00:08:30,555 --> 00:08:31,849
MATT: Perception check.

216
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:34,987
LIAM: Yeah, perception.

217
00:08:34,987 --> 00:08:37,500
LAURA: Um. 25.

218
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,751
MATT: You look back over your shoulder and notice
the door just (creaking, bang) and closes.

219
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:42,318
LAURA: Okay.

220
00:08:42,318 --> 00:08:43,026
TRAVIS: Fuck.

221
00:08:43,026 --> 00:08:43,984
LAURA: No, that's...

222
00:08:43,984 --> 00:08:45,254
MATT: As it closes--

223
00:08:45,254 --> 00:08:46,033
TRAVIS: She's out here now.

224
00:08:46,033 --> 00:08:50,202
MATT: --there's a sudden flash of wind, and
there's a flicker in Pike's form as all of a

225
00:08:50,202 --> 00:08:51,683
sudden she (flickering sound)

226
00:08:51,683 --> 00:08:52,840
LAURA: No!

227
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,009
PIKE: Guys?

228
00:08:54,009 --> 00:09:00,504
MATT: And her divine form vanishes in place,
apparently sent back to the source of where she

229
00:09:00,504 --> 00:09:02,217
projected her essence.

230
00:09:02,217 --> 00:09:03,623
LAURA: She didn't get, like, stolen or something?

231
00:09:03,623 --> 00:09:05,005
LIAM: That is never not unsettling.

232
00:09:05,005 --> 00:09:06,066
LAURA: Away?

233
00:09:06,066 --> 00:09:09,263
MATT: Uh, not to your knowledge. It's similar to
the previous times that she's been unable to keep

234
00:09:09,263 --> 00:09:16,582
her form there for you. Especially between planes,
you can imagine it's been rather difficult for

235
00:09:16,582 --> 00:09:19,057
her to be here for the time she has.

236
00:09:19,057 --> 00:09:22,468
LAURA: Maybe the hag cast a Dispell she did on the
broom?

237
00:09:22,468 --> 00:09:24,627
MARISHA: Yeah, Dispell Magic.

238
00:09:24,627 --> 00:09:26,530
TALIESIN: Or maybe things just got strange.

239
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:27,641
MARISHA: Poor reception.

240
00:09:27,641 --> 00:09:28,673
SAM: Something I said.

241
00:09:28,673 --> 00:09:29,679
LAURA: Love you, Pike.

242
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:31,223
TRAVIS: Something you said. (laughs)

243
00:09:31,223 --> 00:09:34,813
LAURA: Definitely something you said.

244
00:09:34,813 --> 00:09:35,585
MARISHA: Okay.

245
00:09:35,585 --> 00:09:36,926
MATT: All right.

246
00:09:36,926 --> 00:09:41,405
MARISHA: Can we see the hag moving
inside the hut through the window?

247
00:09:41,405 --> 00:09:44,176
MATT: You make a perception check as you're
glancing that way.

248
00:09:44,176 --> 00:09:45,475
TRAVIS: Can I look for Ukurat?

249
00:09:45,475 --> 00:09:48,334
MATT: Perception check.

250
00:09:48,334 --> 00:09:49,033
MARISHA: Oh my god.

251
00:09:49,033 --> 00:09:50,040
LAURA: Seriously?

252
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,990
MARISHA: 14.

253
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,991
MATT: 14? You see movement on the inside,
but no actual physical bead on an entity.

254
00:09:54,991 --> 00:09:57,439
You just see the light being broken in the
window.

255
00:09:57,439 --> 00:09:58,499
LAURA: Okay, so she's...

256
00:09:58,499 --> 00:09:59,396
MARISHA: Yeah, she's inside.

257
00:09:59,396 --> 00:10:00,437
LAURA: That's good.

258
00:10:00,437 --> 00:10:01,936
TRAVIS: A gigantic 11.

259
00:10:01,936 --> 00:10:03,226
SAM: You've yet to break single digits with them.

260
00:10:03,226 --> 00:10:04,219
TALIESIN: New die.

261
00:10:04,219 --> 00:10:07,684
MATT: You barely notice anything beyond the trees,
you have to remind yourself, oh, there's a house

262
00:10:07,684 --> 00:10:09,447
there. But.

263
00:10:09,447 --> 00:10:11,524
(Laura laughs.)

264
00:10:11,524 --> 00:10:13,669
TRAVIS: That sounds accurate.

265
00:10:13,669 --> 00:10:15,471
MATT: Yeah.

266
00:10:15,471 --> 00:10:18,230
TRAVIS: Who are these people, like, (gasps).

267
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:22,685
LAURA: Keyleth, what direction was the big scary
blight on the land?

268
00:10:22,685 --> 00:10:23,683
MARISHA: Northeast?

269
00:10:23,683 --> 00:10:24,496
SAM: Northwest.

270
00:10:24,496 --> 00:10:25,434
MATT: Northwest.

271
00:10:25,434 --> 00:10:26,789
MARISHA: Northwest. Northwest.

272
00:10:26,789 --> 00:10:27,951
LAURA: So we head that direction.

273
00:10:27,951 --> 00:10:29,392
MARISHA: This direction.

274
00:10:29,392 --> 00:10:31,315
MATT: All right. (laughs)

275
00:10:31,315 --> 00:10:32,542
MARISHA: This direction.

276
00:10:32,542 --> 00:10:37,095
MATT: Following Keyleth's lead, you guys begin to
slowly make your way through this bog and--

277
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,833
LAURA: Keep an eye out for anything moving.

278
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:42,497
MATT: Everything's slowly moving in its own right,
this kind of (sludgey sound)

279
00:10:42,497 --> 00:10:43,727
LAURA: Shit.

280
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:45,296
TRAVIS: Easy there, tiger.

281
00:10:45,296 --> 00:10:46,526
MATT: Sliding of awful liquid.

282
00:10:46,526 --> 00:10:47,977
LAURA: Anything seemingly aggressive.

283
00:10:47,977 --> 00:10:49,076
MATT: Understood.

284
00:10:49,076 --> 00:10:51,302
TRAVIS: Don't shoot any trees.

285
00:10:51,302 --> 00:10:57,512
MATT: As you kind of push further, further
northward, you guys are having...

286
00:10:57,512 --> 00:10:58,950
do you have to sneeze?

287
00:10:58,950 --> 00:10:59,662
LAURA: It went away.

288
00:10:59,662 --> 00:11:05,824
MATT: Okay, good. You get the sensation,
it's not even a sensation, the rest of the party

289
00:11:05,824 --> 00:11:09,881
-- aside from you-- you guys are getting knee-deep
in this liquid now, and it's to the point where

290
00:11:09,881 --> 00:11:14,830
you're having to take one step, lurch it out of
the liquid onto another, and you're having to go

291
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:19,388
out of your way to kind of hug the edges of trees
where the roots themselves are protruding to give

292
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:22,481
yourself some kind of foothold as opposed to
getting stuck in this bog. You, Scanlan,

293
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:27,135
are having a particularly rough time trying to
walk on your own, because with each... though with

294
00:11:27,135 --> 00:11:30,348
your light form, it's a lot of strength to even
pull your

295
00:11:30,348 --> 00:11:34,476
little feet out of this tar-like substance. So.

296
00:11:34,476 --> 00:11:37,145
TRAVIS: Yeah, Pimps-a-lot, you wanna?

297
00:11:37,145 --> 00:11:38,535
SAM: Absolutely.

298
00:11:38,535 --> 00:11:39,360
TRAVIS: Okay.

299
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,512
TRAVIS: Can I pick him up? And it's black stuff,
right?

300
00:11:41,512 --> 00:11:42,442
MATT: Yeah.

301
00:11:42,442 --> 00:11:44,045
TRAVIS: Can I smell the black stuff on him?

302
00:11:44,045 --> 00:11:48,260
MATT: Yeah, I mean, it permeates the area but it's
particularly strong at his feet and lower

303
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:56,809
extremities, almost went up to his upper thighs.
It is a, it smells like a combination of wet

304
00:11:56,809 --> 00:12:04,042
blacktop, sulfur, and compost decay.

305
00:12:04,042 --> 00:12:06,388
TRAVIS: Yeah, in the summer?

306
00:12:06,388 --> 00:12:09,442
MATT: Yeah, like a hot, hot, Florida compost,
yeah.

307
00:12:09,442 --> 00:12:10,820
TRAVIS: I know that exact, accurate smell.

308
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,777
MATT: Yeah. It's delightful.

309
00:12:12,777 --> 00:12:14,643
SAM: Drakkar.

310
00:12:14,643 --> 00:12:16,316
TRAVIS: You smell terrible.

311
00:12:16,316 --> 00:12:17,665
SAM: Sorry.

312
00:12:17,665 --> 00:12:19,214
LAURA: That's a lot, coming from Grog.

313
00:12:19,214 --> 00:12:20,758
SAM: That is true.

314
00:12:20,758 --> 00:12:24,083
TRAVIS: How about you, I'll put you on my
shoulder, but how about you sit on my shoulder

315
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,739
like strapped back there and just hang out the
back?

316
00:12:26,739 --> 00:12:28,301
SAM: Sit on your shoulder straps.

317
00:12:28,301 --> 00:12:32,734
TRAVIS: No, don't put your feet near my face,
like hang out on the back of me.

318
00:12:32,734 --> 00:12:34,896
SAM: All right, all right. Thank you for the
lift.

319
00:12:34,896 --> 00:12:37,398
TRAVIS: No worries.

320
00:12:37,398 --> 00:12:40,435
LAURA: It's good, you can keep an eye out for the
hag following behind us.

321
00:12:40,435 --> 00:12:41,492
SAM: That's good.

322
00:12:41,492 --> 00:12:43,697
SAM: Wait, am I like being Yoda-carried right
now?

323
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:45,709
(All laugh.)

324
00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:46,935
LAURA: Yes.

325
00:12:46,935 --> 00:12:49,724
TRAVIS: I'm flipping and climbing vines and shit.

326
00:12:49,724 --> 00:12:55,102
MARISHA: Oh man, that makes me want a Scanlan
backpack. Oh man.

327
00:12:55,102 --> 00:13:00,685
MATT: Okay. As you guys push on forward,
Keyleth guiding the direction, you're the only

328
00:13:00,685 --> 00:13:04,450
one who moves without an issue. Are you tracking
ahead of the party, or are you staying with them?

329
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,551
LAURA: I am tracking a little bit ahead of them.

330
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:12,765
MATT: All right. You travel for about another hour
or so forward, and you, just being naturally alert

331
00:13:12,765 --> 00:13:18,987
as you are, notice some shift of movement that is
more sudden than the slow sway of some of the

332
00:13:18,987 --> 00:13:24,603
various branches and boughs of nearby trees.
A little bit in the direction you're traveling

333
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:25,906
and to the left.

334
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:27,893
LAURA: What did it look like? Just movement?

335
00:13:27,893 --> 00:13:32,808
MATT: It moves again, and you see what appears to
be some almost large rock-like figure that's

336
00:13:32,808 --> 00:13:38,814
shifting, and the more you take a moment to focus,
it looks like a humanoid-type creature hunched

337
00:13:38,814 --> 00:13:42,152
over, facing away from you.

338
00:13:42,152 --> 00:13:46,558
LAURA: (mouthing) We should go, we should go that
way.

339
00:13:46,558 --> 00:13:50,540
LAURA: Can I point everybody to go around,
keeping a wide berth?

340
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,653
MATT: Okay.

341
00:13:51,653 --> 00:13:52,738
TRAVIS: Lead the way.

342
00:13:52,738 --> 00:13:55,329
LAURA: Percy, look over there with your eyesight,
look through

343
00:13:55,329 --> 00:13:57,745
your little scope and see what you see.

344
00:13:57,745 --> 00:13:59,490
TALIESIN: I'm gonna try and scope it.

345
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:02,661
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check with
advantage.

346
00:14:02,867 --> 00:14:08,882
TALIESIN: Ugh. Could be worse. 16.

347
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:09,815
LAURA: Oh.

348
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:15,841
MATT: Okay. You, um. You take a moment and kind of
train on this movement. You now see there are two

349
00:14:15,841 --> 00:14:21,484
figures that are facing each other, and they
themselves are covered in this horrible liquid,

350
00:14:21,484 --> 00:14:27,991
and you recognize the form a little bit.
These, they're humanoid, but they have long,

351
00:14:27,991 --> 00:14:36,957
exaggerated jaws, very long forearm limbs, tall,
straggly black hair, long, pointed hooked nose,

352
00:14:36,957 --> 00:14:43,547
and they're both eating something that's
partially stuck in this bog. These are trolls,

353
00:14:43,547 --> 00:14:49,062
these are two large trolls that are currently in
the process of eating some sort of creature.

354
00:14:49,062 --> 00:14:50,997
TALIESIN: A pair of trolls.

355
00:14:50,997 --> 00:14:53,061
LAURA: (whispering) We need to be very quiet.

356
00:14:53,061 --> 00:14:55,483
MATT: You've had a piece of troll in your bag for
a while.

357
00:14:55,483 --> 00:14:56,340
LAURA: Oh!

358
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,657
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. Troll dick.

359
00:14:58,657 --> 00:15:00,455
LAURA: So we've killed them before, that's good to
know.

360
00:15:00,455 --> 00:15:02,167
TRAVIS: Yeah. They're huge.

361
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:03,625
MATT: Trolls are pretty big.

362
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:04,801
LAURA: They were--

363
00:15:04,801 --> 00:15:06,301
TRAIVS: About how big are they?

364
00:15:06,301 --> 00:15:09,036
MATT: Like... I'd say, even with the hunch,
nine feet tall.

365
00:15:09,036 --> 00:15:15,037
LAURA: Yeah. Just... you know, maybe go around?

366
00:15:15,037 --> 00:15:16,686
SAM: Yes, we should go around.

367
00:15:16,686 --> 00:15:18,108
LAURA: What do you think?

368
00:15:18,108 --> 00:15:19,658
SAM: We could kill them quite easily.

369
00:15:19,658 --> 00:15:20,458
TRAVIS: Yeah.

370
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,021
LAURA: Well, there's two of them that we see.

371
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:23,723
TALIESIN: That we see.

372
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:24,898
TRAVIS: Hey, Percy.

373
00:15:24,898 --> 00:15:27,692
LIAM: They're stupid, aren't they?

374
00:15:27,692 --> 00:15:28,891
LAURA: Didn't, wait--

375
00:15:28,891 --> 00:15:29,846
MARISHA: I don't know.

376
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:32,163
LAURA: Didn't Tiberius turn into a lady-troll?

377
00:15:32,163 --> 00:15:33,593
TALIESIN: That was a thing, yes.

378
00:15:33,593 --> 00:15:34,904
MARISHA: That happened.

379
00:15:34,904 --> 00:15:35,931
LAURA: Oh.

380
00:15:35,931 --> 00:15:38,172
MARISHA: To be fair, also, everything in the
Feywild--

381
00:15:38,172 --> 00:15:39,158
SAM: What?

382
00:15:39,158 --> 00:15:42,224
MARISHA: -- has been more sensitive, defensive,
and more intelligent.

383
00:15:42,224 --> 00:15:43,612
LAURA: They could be smarter.

384
00:15:43,612 --> 00:15:45,083
TALIESIN: They could be smart trolls.

385
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:47,268
LAURA: They could be, like, hag trolls, which is
just terrifying.

386
00:15:47,268 --> 00:15:49,392
TALIESIN: They're eating something that's stuck.

387
00:15:49,392 --> 00:15:51,230
LAURA: Which could be us very soon.

388
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,602
TALIESIN: Which could be us very soon.

389
00:15:52,602 --> 00:15:53,870
LAURA: We need to keep moving.

390
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,046
TALIESIN: Let's keep moving.

391
00:15:55,046 --> 00:15:56,576
LAURA: The longer we stand still, the more stuck
we get.

392
00:15:56,576 --> 00:15:59,594
MATT: You hear this (grunt) in the distance,
and you now, looking through your scope,

393
00:15:59,594 --> 00:16:03,751
you see that one of them has looked up from its
eating, its mouth covered in all sorts of shiny,

394
00:16:03,751 --> 00:16:09,400
fresh liquid, and it kind of glances past.
Its eyes, the pupils are white against yellow

395
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:15,887
eyes, so it has this very kind of flash across a
cat's face type gleam across the eyeballs.

396
00:16:15,887 --> 00:16:20,743
They kind of... (grunts)

397
00:16:20,743 --> 00:16:22,219
LIAM: Can we all see this?

398
00:16:22,219 --> 00:16:25,738
MATT: Yeah, you guys can see, since you've all
made note of these creatures in the distance.

399
00:16:25,738 --> 00:16:28,172
LIAM: Why don't we back it up slow for once?

400
00:16:28,172 --> 00:16:30,357
LAURA: Well, how about we don't move at all right
now?

401
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:32,807
MARISHA: Everybody freeze.

402
00:16:32,807 --> 00:16:38,946
MATT: Turns around, (trollish grunt), says
something to the other one. They both grab a big

403
00:16:38,946 --> 00:16:43,023
chunk of whatever they're eating, jam it in their
mouth, and then dive down into the muck.

404
00:16:43,023 --> 00:16:44,858
SAM: Oh, shit.

405
00:16:44,858 --> 00:16:47,703
LAURA: Can we get up in the trees?

406
00:16:47,703 --> 00:16:49,458
MATT: If you'd like to try and climb them.

407
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:50,818
LAURA: Can we try and climb the trees?

408
00:16:50,818 --> 00:16:52,095
TALIESIN: We're going to try and climb a tree.

409
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:53,765
SAM: To what end? Then we're just gonna sit here
forever?

410
00:16:53,765 --> 00:16:54,629
TALIESIN: For a minute.

411
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:57,868
LAURA: Well no, we can go from tree branch to tree
branch. Are they tightly enough connected that we

412
00:16:57,868 --> 00:16:59,427
can travel on the top of the trees?

413
00:16:59,427 --> 00:17:01,158
MATT: Possibly. Might require some jumping.

414
00:17:01,158 --> 00:17:02,573
SAM: I am a backpack right now.

415
00:17:02,573 --> 00:17:04,416
LAURA: I'm gonna get on the broom and fly up.

416
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:07,601
MATT: You fly up.

417
00:17:07,601 --> 00:17:09,361
LIAM: I'll climb after her.

418
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,617
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make an athletics check,
if you don't mind, Vax.

419
00:17:11,617 --> 00:17:14,304
TRAVIS: I'm not scared of trolls.

420
00:17:14,304 --> 00:17:14,891
LIAM: 18.

421
00:17:14,891 --> 00:17:16,310
SAM: Could you be, please?

422
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:20,425
MATT: It takes you a minute, but you manage to get
up to the tree. You come up into the trees.

423
00:17:20,425 --> 00:17:22,808
Do you break the canopy, or do you stop up at the
branches?

424
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:28,319
LAURA: I wanted to... yeah, sure, I'll break the
canopy.

425
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,260
MATT: Okay. As you're climbing up, your sister
actually goes past where the branches, leaves,

426
00:17:32,281 --> 00:17:36,811
and the top of the trees end. Before you can
really kind of speak out to question, she

427
00:17:36,811 --> 00:17:43,867
disappears. You, Vex, come shooting up off the top
out, and you can see now before you the Shademirk

428
00:17:43,867 --> 00:17:48,783
in its entirety, kind of wrapping around the base
of this one mountain, that kind of comes up into

429
00:17:48,869 --> 00:17:56,520
two sharp peaks, like horns on some sort of a
large debased devil, but it's just a formless rock

430
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:01,417
mold that comes up into those two peaks.
Looking around you, you can see the trees are

431
00:18:01,417 --> 00:18:06,961
very, very dense and heavily packed together,
and what immediately catches your eye is about

432
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:14,168
two, three miles ahead, right towards where the
base of the mountain seems to sink into the

433
00:18:14,168 --> 00:18:19,606
Shademirk, there is one very, very large tree that
stands above the rest of them.

434
00:18:19,606 --> 00:18:21,647
LAURA: Oh, shit. Why didn't I go above the canopy
before?

435
00:18:21,647 --> 00:18:23,746
MARISHA: Is it to the northwest?

436
00:18:23,746 --> 00:18:28,159
MATT: It is what would be considered to the
northwest of you. It, whereas the rest of the

437
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:34,910
Shademirk continues to this relative 20-,
30-foot-tall canopy, this tree probably goes

438
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:40,880
up about a hundred-plus feet and the branches
string outward and have long strands and vines

439
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:49,107
dangling from them, it's, this is a massive
example of local flora and fauna.

440
00:18:49,107 --> 00:18:55,211
LAURA: Wow. Okay. I say, I see the tree! And I
come back down into the canopy.

441
00:18:55,211 --> 00:18:56,414
MATT: Okay.

442
00:18:56,414 --> 00:19:03,116
LAURA: Can I come down and grab... Keyleth? And
lift her up into the tree too?

443
00:19:03,116 --> 00:19:04,266
MATT: Sure.

444
00:19:04,266 --> 00:19:06,907
MARISHA: Ooh.

445
00:19:06,907 --> 00:19:10,420
TRAVIS: How high are the lowest branches?

446
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:14,192
MATT: The lowest branches are about seven feet
up.

447
00:19:14,192 --> 00:19:16,152
TRAVIS: You wanna lift?

448
00:19:16,152 --> 00:19:22,302
SAM: I'm just a passenger. I'm on you. If you're
not going up, I'm staying on you.

449
00:19:22,302 --> 00:19:23,531
TRAVIS: I'm not going up.

450
00:19:23,531 --> 00:19:24,581
LAURA: You're not gonna go up in the tree?

451
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:25,465
SAM: We're gonna--

452
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:29,098
TRAVIS: You think my giant ass is gonna jump
frockily-fucky-fucky from branch to branch in the

453
00:19:29,098 --> 00:19:31,856
treetops like some kind of acrobat?

454
00:19:31,856 --> 00:19:32,887
LAURA: I don't know.

455
00:19:32,887 --> 00:19:35,209
TRAVIS: No! No.

456
00:19:35,209 --> 00:19:40,125
SAM: We're standing our muck.

457
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:44,890
MARISHA: Well, okay, is what we're trying to do
figure out a way to not have to walk in the muck?

458
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:45,980
LAURA: Yeah, I think so.

459
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,085
MARISHA: You're--

460
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:49,955
LAURA: I feel like the trolls are gonna pop up,
like, somewhere near us.

461
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:51,776
TRAVIS: Can I put my back against a tree?

462
00:19:51,776 --> 00:19:52,478
MATT: Yeah.

463
00:19:52,478 --> 00:19:53,404
TRAVIS: A large tree.

464
00:19:53,404 --> 00:19:56,457
MATT: Yeah. The nearest tree, the one that Vax
actually climbed up, is the one that's closest to

465
00:19:56,457 --> 00:20:01,749
you guys, and it's close enough for you to just
take a five-foot step back up into it.

466
00:20:01,749 --> 00:20:05,625
SAM: I'm back here! I'm back here, I'm back here,
I'm back here!

467
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:06,955
LAURA: You're against the tree.

468
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:10,193
TRAVIS: I turn around. The trees talk.

469
00:20:10,193 --> 00:20:12,270
SAM: It's me. Don't back up into a tree--

470
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,041
TRAVIS: I spin around again and put my back to
this tree.

471
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:16,822
SAM: I'm still back here! I'm still back here!

472
00:20:16,822 --> 00:20:17,863
TRAVIS: Oh.

473
00:20:17,863 --> 00:20:20,121
LAURA: While that's going on, can I fly down and
get Percy out of the muck

474
00:20:20,121 --> 00:20:21,614
and bring him up into the tree?

475
00:20:21,614 --> 00:20:23,057
MATT: Sure.

476
00:20:23,057 --> 00:20:26,671
LIAM: I'm gonna chime in over the earring and say,
Somebody could turn Grog into a marmoset or

477
00:20:26,671 --> 00:20:28,459
something, that would work for the circumstances.

478
00:20:28,459 --> 00:20:29,777
LAURA: Oh, shit.

479
00:20:29,777 --> 00:20:33,323
MARISHA: That's what I was gonna say, I can always
polymorph you for a moment, Grog.

480
00:20:33,323 --> 00:20:38,531
TRAVIS: I might be down with being some kind of
monkey.

481
00:20:38,531 --> 00:20:43,473
MARISHA: You want to be a monkey? Yeah. What kind
of monkey?

482
00:20:43,473 --> 00:20:44,334
TRAVIS: Gorilla.

483
00:20:44,334 --> 00:20:45,143
MARISHA: Okay.

484
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:46,203
LAURA: Oh, shit.

485
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:48,008
MARISHA: And I turn Grog into a gorilla.

486
00:20:48,008 --> 00:20:51,922
MATT: And with that, Grog's already pretty large
form just grows smaller and hairier.

487
00:20:51,922 --> 00:20:56,130
TRAVIS: Nimble as shit.

488
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:59,453
LAURA: What the fuck! I should get Scanlan...

489
00:20:59,453 --> 00:21:03,700
MATT: You look down at yourself and kind of
marveling at your hands, which haven't changed too

490
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:07,472
much other than the place some of the fingers and
thumbs, you already have pretty big, strong,

491
00:21:07,472 --> 00:21:11,833
hands, but you also pull up one of your feet from
the muck and you can see the additional appendage

492
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:17,810
that you now have in the prehensile toes.

493
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:20,179
LAURA: Grog, get in the tree, get in the tree.

494
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:21,487
TALIESIN: I don't see a change, I'm not sure.

495
00:21:21,487 --> 00:21:22,093
TRAVIS: No.

496
00:21:22,093 --> 00:21:22,732
LAURA: Tree.

497
00:21:22,732 --> 00:21:23,351
TRAVIS: No.

498
00:21:23,351 --> 00:21:24,436
LAURA: Please.

499
00:21:24,436 --> 00:21:25,080
TRAVIS: Grog.

500
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,198
LAURA: Aw.

501
00:21:26,198 --> 00:21:28,102
SAM: Also has the mind of an ape.

502
00:21:28,102 --> 00:21:29,044
MATT: Yep.

503
00:21:29,044 --> 00:21:30,004
LAURA: Seriously?

504
00:21:30,004 --> 00:21:30,895
MATT: Yeah.

505
00:21:30,895 --> 00:21:32,813
MARISHA: Which might be more intelligent than what
he was before...

506
00:21:32,813 --> 00:21:33,893
MATT: Actually, let's...

507
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:35,007
TRAVIS: Ah, shit.

508
00:21:35,007 --> 00:21:37,507
MATT: Let's have a look what the--

509
00:21:37,507 --> 00:21:41,184
TRAVIS: Gorillas can't--

510
00:21:41,184 --> 00:21:45,697
MATT: Let's see, let's pull up the Monster Manual
here and see exactly what we're working with.

511
00:21:45,697 --> 00:21:47,125
LAURA: Gorillas are pretty fucking smart.

512
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,129
TALIESIN: Yeah, you have one, don't you?

513
00:21:48,129 --> 00:21:49,461
MARISHA: I think I do.

514
00:21:49,461 --> 00:21:51,396
LAURA: I think they'd be smarter than Grog.

515
00:21:51,396 --> 00:21:53,254
MARISHA: I do, but I don't have it in my little
book.

516
00:21:53,254 --> 00:21:55,371
LAURA: They can learn sign language, they have,
like, an entire, yeah.

517
00:21:55,371 --> 00:21:59,918
LIAM: Strongjaw's kitten?

518
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:02,152
LAURA: Oh!

519
00:22:02,152 --> 00:22:06,973
MATT: All right, we'll go with the stats for an
ape, 'cause that's what's here and available.

520
00:22:06,973 --> 00:22:10,090
They do have intelligence of six, so you are as
intelligent as you were before.

521
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,974
(All laugh.)

522
00:22:11,974 --> 00:22:13,473
TRAVIS: But I do this with my foot.

523
00:22:13,473 --> 00:22:16,883
(All laugh.)

524
00:22:16,883 --> 00:22:18,912
MARISHA: Looks good on you, Grog.

525
00:22:18,912 --> 00:22:20,631
TRAVIS: I'm gonna-- can I?

526
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:21,636
MATT: No, you can't talk.

527
00:22:21,636 --> 00:22:24,465
TRAVIS: (gorilla noises)

528
00:22:24,465 --> 00:22:28,392
LAURA: Shit. Scanlan, do you want to ride on
Grog's back still,

529
00:22:28,392 --> 00:22:29,867
or do you want to come up in the tree?

530
00:22:29,867 --> 00:22:30,874
SAM: No, I don't--

531
00:22:30,874 --> 00:22:32,093
TRAVIS: (gorilla noises)

532
00:22:32,093 --> 00:22:35,578
MARISHA: Ooh, you'd be like a little silverback
baby.

533
00:22:35,578 --> 00:22:37,757
LAURA: Can I go down and grab Scanlan and put him
on the broom with me?

534
00:22:37,757 --> 00:22:38,436
MATT: Sure.

535
00:22:38,436 --> 00:22:39,136
LAURA: Okay.

536
00:22:39,136 --> 00:22:40,283
SAM: Thank you.

537
00:22:40,283 --> 00:22:42,038
LIAM: Honestly, I can't even tell the difference.

538
00:22:42,038 --> 00:22:43,821
TRAVIS: That still translates, right?

539
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:45,063
MATT: Yeah.

540
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:47,805
MARISHA: Okay, I know the twins are good on
flying, for the most part.

541
00:22:47,805 --> 00:22:49,314
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll stay down here as bait.

542
00:22:49,314 --> 00:22:50,859
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

543
00:22:50,859 --> 00:22:55,298
LIAM: I don't know, how long ago did you bust out
my wings for me, DM? Under 24 hours?

544
00:22:55,298 --> 00:22:57,962
MATT: Yeah, it's been under 24 hours. So
unfortunately your wings are not available.

545
00:22:57,962 --> 00:22:59,399
LAURA: No wings for you.

546
00:22:59,399 --> 00:23:03,055
MARISHA: Well, but you can walk unhindered,
right? You can walk fine?

547
00:23:03,055 --> 00:23:04,293
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

548
00:23:04,293 --> 00:23:06,136
MARISHA: Can someone borrow your broom?

549
00:23:06,136 --> 00:23:07,306
LAURA: Again? Yes.

550
00:23:07,306 --> 00:23:08,405
MARISHA: Again. (laughs)

551
00:23:08,405 --> 00:23:10,671
LAURA: Yeah, that worked really well last time.
Totally. Somebody can.

552
00:23:10,671 --> 00:23:13,894
MARISHA: Give it to your brother. He's
trustworthy, right? Right? Right, Vax?

553
00:23:13,894 --> 00:23:21,231
LAURA: He had the carpet before, so. Maybe not so
much, but the whole point was for the trolls to

554
00:23:21,231 --> 00:23:24,982
not have us on the ground, the trolls, but.

555
00:23:24,982 --> 00:23:26,587
MARISHA: Oh, right, that's true.

556
00:23:26,587 --> 00:23:28,458
LAURA: Can we just try to travel amongst the
trees?

557
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:30,234
TALIESIN: Let's see what happens.

558
00:23:30,234 --> 00:23:33,293
SAM: Stick to the plan.

559
00:23:33,293 --> 00:23:37,734
MARISHA: I'm gonna go ahead, I'm gonna use a
Beastshape and I'm gonna go into an eagle form.

560
00:23:37,734 --> 00:23:43,694
MATT: Okay. Giant eagle. All right. Beastshape is
taken, he's gorillafied,

561
00:23:43,694 --> 00:23:45,562
you have Scanlan up on your broom.

562
00:23:45,562 --> 00:23:46,784
LAURA: Yes.

563
00:23:46,784 --> 00:23:49,875
MATT: And then Vax and... Percy, are you just
traveling through the canopy?

564
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:51,044
LAURA: Shit.

565
00:23:51,044 --> 00:23:52,660
MATT: Or are you carrying somebody, Keyleth?

566
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,632
LAURA: Do you wanna carry Scanlan?

567
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:54,860
MARISHA: I can carry Scanlan.

568
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:55,933
MATT: Okay.

569
00:23:55,933 --> 00:23:57,394
LIAM: How thick are the trees here?

570
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:58,756
LAURA: I feel like we could--

571
00:23:58,756 --> 00:24:01,217
MATT: They range anywhere from between five feet
and--

572
00:24:01,217 --> 00:24:05,228
LIAM: I had such a hard time when I flew up the
other day, such a hard time...

573
00:24:05,228 --> 00:24:06,705
LAURA: Yeah.

574
00:24:06,705 --> 00:24:09,923
LIAM: And everyone's just floating up, easy as
pie.

575
00:24:09,923 --> 00:24:12,535
MARISHA: To be fair, I've been flying a lot longer
than you have, Vax.

576
00:24:12,535 --> 00:24:14,366
LAURA: That's true, and your wings are much larger
than hers were.

577
00:24:14,366 --> 00:24:15,143
MARISHA: It's true.

578
00:24:15,143 --> 00:24:16,388
LIAM: Yeah.

579
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:19,470
LAURA: Yeah. And I've got a skinny little broom,
so I'm not flapping any wings.

580
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:21,249
LIAM: I'm skinnier than your broom.

581
00:24:21,249 --> 00:24:22,477
LAURA: Yes, well.

582
00:24:22,477 --> 00:24:24,884
(Marisha laughs.)

583
00:24:24,884 --> 00:24:26,440
LIAM: Let's do it.

584
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,098
TALIESIN: All right.

585
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:28,066
MATT: All right.

586
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:31,226
LAURA: Then I guess I can take one of you on the
broom with me.

587
00:24:31,226 --> 00:24:33,833
TALIESIN: Take him. I'll be fine. I'm gonna,
I have a potion of climbing.

588
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:35,878
LAURA: Do you wanna hop on this, since you have no
flight?

589
00:24:35,878 --> 00:24:37,261
MARISHA: Ooh, potion of climbing, nice.

590
00:24:37,261 --> 00:24:38,281
LAURA: Brother?

591
00:24:38,281 --> 00:24:41,315
MARISHA: All right, I fly over to Scanlan.

592
00:24:41,315 --> 00:24:42,981
LIAM: No, but I will anyway.

593
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,355
SAM: I'm with you now?

594
00:24:44,355 --> 00:24:45,475
MARISHA: (eagle sound)

595
00:24:45,475 --> 00:24:46,613
LAURA: All right, he's on the broom with me.

596
00:24:46,613 --> 00:24:49,844
MATT: All right, so the twins are on the broom,
they go up. Grog, you just have a field day

597
00:24:49,844 --> 00:24:55,433
leaping through those branches, and just coasting
through, keeping an eye best you can on the

598
00:24:55,433 --> 00:24:58,667
guiding broom above the actual tree canopy.
You go ahead and

599
00:24:58,667 --> 00:25:00,842
grab Scanlan as well and follow suit.

600
00:25:00,842 --> 00:25:04,872
MATT: As soon as you break up as well, you can see
the large tree in the distance. Percy, doing the

601
00:25:04,872 --> 00:25:08,571
best you can to keep an eye on Grog or at least
listen to that regard, you drink your potion of

602
00:25:08,571 --> 00:25:13,257
climbing and begin leaping off and kind of
ninja-scattering your way through the higher

603
00:25:13,257 --> 00:25:14,822
branches of the trees as well.

604
00:25:14,822 --> 00:25:16,072
TRAVIS: Anime shit.

605
00:25:16,072 --> 00:25:16,933
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

606
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:22,837
MATT: So if I can go ahead and get Grog and Percy
to go ahead and make three successive athletics

607
00:25:22,837 --> 00:25:24,304
checks, if you could.

608
00:25:24,304 --> 00:25:25,989
TALIESIN: With advantage?

609
00:25:25,989 --> 00:25:28,190
MATT: This would be, for you it would be
advantage, yeah.

610
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:31,777
TRAVIS: What's the modifier for king of the apes?

611
00:25:31,777 --> 00:25:34,206
MATT: You know what, I'll give you advantage on
this just 'cause you're an ape.

612
00:25:34,206 --> 00:25:36,644
TALIESIN: Athletics or acrobatics?

613
00:25:36,644 --> 00:25:39,329
MATT: Um. For the purposes of climbing and
grabbing,

614
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:40,868
I would say this is more of an athletics check.

615
00:25:40,868 --> 00:25:41,789
TALIESIN: Okay.

616
00:25:41,789 --> 00:25:44,331
MATT: Since this is more upper-body strength
and--

617
00:25:44,331 --> 00:25:47,779
LAURA: Not parkouring, not parkouring through the
treetops.

618
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:48,602
TALIESIN: That'll do.

619
00:25:48,602 --> 00:25:50,106
TRAVIS: That's a 20, 12 plus eight.

620
00:25:50,106 --> 00:25:51,305
TALIESIN: 16.

621
00:25:51,305 --> 00:25:55,096
MATT: All righty.

622
00:25:55,096 --> 00:25:56,168
TRAVIS: 21.

623
00:25:56,168 --> 00:25:57,232
TALIESIN: 24.

624
00:25:57,232 --> 00:25:59,198
MATT: All righty. Last one.

625
00:25:59,198 --> 00:26:01,171
TRAVIS: Not so great. 23.

626
00:26:01,171 --> 00:26:02,918
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

627
00:26:02,918 --> 00:26:09,190
MATT: All righty. To your surprise, as the potion
energy surges through your body, even with the

628
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:13,328
relatively slick surface that a lot of these
branches and trees have, you have an innate

629
00:26:13,328 --> 00:26:17,237
ability to point out which ones are the strongest,
easiest to grab a hold and just keep the momentum

630
00:26:17,237 --> 00:26:21,251
going in the semblance of a parkour-like
leap-and-grab-type circumstance, you have managed

631
00:26:21,251 --> 00:26:26,313
to move through almost with the grace of the
gorilla ahead of you. You lose sight a few times,

632
00:26:26,313 --> 00:26:31,088
but you guys do take the better part of the next
forty minutes or so to eventually make your way

633
00:26:31,088 --> 00:26:37,004
closer and closer to the tree where the shadow,
the shade of it against the permanently dusk sun

634
00:26:37,004 --> 00:26:41,973
now begins to creep over the place you are in the
forest. You have now entered a shaded nightfall by

635
00:26:41,973 --> 00:26:48,251
the actual tree's location and placement.
The lower forest below you is pitch-black at this

636
00:26:48,251 --> 00:26:53,014
point, other than a little bit of light that
filters in from nearby lit areas of the forest.

637
00:26:53,014 --> 00:26:54,490
(Audible feedback.)

638
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:55,206
LAURA: Oh.

639
00:26:55,206 --> 00:26:55,878
MATT: Oh?

640
00:26:55,878 --> 00:26:56,498
LAURA: Oh.

641
00:26:56,498 --> 00:26:57,774
SAM: There's a punk band warming up.

642
00:26:57,774 --> 00:26:59,516
(All laugh.)

643
00:26:59,516 --> 00:27:10,115
MATT: Never ends. There we go. You guys make your
way towards, are you going straight for the tree

644
00:27:10,115 --> 00:27:11,231
or are you...?

645
00:27:11,231 --> 00:27:13,346
LAURA: Okay. Do we wanna go straight for the tree
now,

646
00:27:13,346 --> 00:27:15,136
or do we wanna like rest up before we do
that?

647
00:27:15,136 --> 00:27:17,074
TALIESIN: I think we want to observe it and rest
up.

648
00:27:17,074 --> 00:27:17,940
LIAM: Observe, yes.

649
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,737
MARISHA: Like scout?

650
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:19,852
LAURA: Watch it and see what's going on with it?

651
00:27:19,852 --> 00:27:20,598
LIAM: Yes.

652
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:21,997
LAURA: Before we just go straight to it?

653
00:27:21,997 --> 00:27:22,993
TRAVIS: We don't have the mansion, right?

654
00:27:22,993 --> 00:27:23,929
SAM: We have the mansion.

655
00:27:23,929 --> 00:27:25,394
TALIESIN: We do. We have the mansion.

656
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,734
TRAVIS: (gorilla noise)

657
00:27:27,734 --> 00:27:30,730
SAM: How many hours since we've slept last?

658
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:35,631
MATT: I'd say it's probably been, surmising,
six to seven.

659
00:27:35,631 --> 00:27:39,853
TALIESIN: Really? It's been since the river.

660
00:27:39,853 --> 00:27:41,128
MATT: Yeah.

661
00:27:41,128 --> 00:27:41,967
LAURA: Yeah.

662
00:27:41,967 --> 00:27:44,745
SAM: So we can at least do some, we can get closer
and do some recon.

663
00:27:44,745 --> 00:27:45,829
LAURA: Yeah.

664
00:27:45,829 --> 00:27:48,065
LIAM: Let's do recon, let's observe it for the
next six to ten hours

665
00:27:48,065 --> 00:27:49,612
and then rest up in the shag.

666
00:27:49,612 --> 00:27:51,032
LAURA: That's a long time. All right.

667
00:27:51,032 --> 00:27:54,829
MARISHA: I go ahead and I take off with Scanlan
and do kind of

668
00:27:54,829 --> 00:27:56,230
a high aerial loop around the tree.

669
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:58,169
SAM: (worried noise)

670
00:27:58,169 --> 00:27:59,448
MATT: All righty.

671
00:27:59,448 --> 00:28:01,379
LAURA: Oh jeez, around the tree? Around it?

672
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:03,638
MARISHA: Just at the top, really high. Really
high, getting nice--

673
00:28:03,638 --> 00:28:09,395
LAURA: I wanna kind of perch on top of a tree
nearby and just kind of see it from there.

674
00:28:09,395 --> 00:28:10,297
MARISHA: Watch.

675
00:28:10,297 --> 00:28:12,692
TALIESIN: I want to see if I can find the source
of the bog muck.

676
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:18,361
MATT: Okay. You both make a perception check from
being up in the tree.

677
00:28:18,361 --> 00:28:20,852
SAM: Wait, tre-- oh.

678
00:28:20,852 --> 00:28:22,227
MARISHA: Do I have advantage because I'm an
eagle?

679
00:28:22,227 --> 00:28:24,119
MATT: Well, it would be--

680
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,756
SAM: Above the tree, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

681
00:28:26,756 --> 00:28:29,125
MARISHA: Don't eagles have advantage?

682
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:30,076
SAM: Eight.

683
00:28:30,076 --> 00:28:33,835
(All laugh.)

684
00:28:33,835 --> 00:28:36,331
MARISHA: I do have advantage.

685
00:28:36,331 --> 00:28:37,326
SAM: Just 'cause.

686
00:28:37,326 --> 00:28:38,077
MARISHA: Okay.

687
00:28:38,077 --> 00:28:38,981
MATT: Eagle eyes.

688
00:28:38,981 --> 00:28:43,572
MARISHA: Eagle eyes. 27.

689
00:28:43,572 --> 00:28:52,156
MATT: 27. As you coast around the outside of this
gargantuan tree, you can see there are a number of

690
00:28:52,156 --> 00:28:57,931
places where the branches meet and where elements
of the bark are slightly split, and there is just

691
00:28:57,931 --> 00:29:06,142
a slow, perpetual flow of this black tar-like
substance. You've seen it on smaller scales

692
00:29:06,142 --> 00:29:11,097
seeping from the trees in this actual forest,
it's like the entirety of the landscape is kind

693
00:29:11,097 --> 00:29:15,969
of creating this, but the bulk of it, whether it
be the source of the general corruption or at

694
00:29:15,969 --> 00:29:21,388
least is the largest central location of its
source? There are a number of places throughout

695
00:29:21,388 --> 00:29:24,945
this tree where it's just seeping out like sap.

696
00:29:24,945 --> 00:29:26,324
MARISHA: Like sap.

697
00:29:26,324 --> 00:29:27,875
LAURA: Like bleeding out oil.

698
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:29,228
MATT: Out of the actual tree.

699
00:29:29,228 --> 00:29:31,298
MARISHA: Like even the top of the tree and stuff.

700
00:29:31,298 --> 00:29:32,839
LIAM: Like evil maple syrup.

701
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:34,159
MARISHA: Evil maple syrup, yeah.

702
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,427
LAURA: Mm, sounds tasty. Can--

703
00:29:36,427 --> 00:29:37,696
TRAVIS: Like ghostbusters.

704
00:29:37,696 --> 00:29:43,215
LAURA: -- we see any kind of movement, any kind of
things moving around the tree?

705
00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:47,742
MATT: You don't see anything moving around the
tree at the moment, other than just the gentle

706
00:29:47,742 --> 00:29:52,308
swaying as a little bit of wind hits the sides of
it, portions of its long hundreds and hundreds of

707
00:29:52,308 --> 00:29:58,992
hanging vines just kind of slowly get moved and
tangled by the windfall. If you want to make a

708
00:29:58,992 --> 00:30:04,852
perception check as well.

709
00:30:04,946 --> 00:30:07,634
LAURA: Okay. That would be 30.

710
00:30:07,634 --> 00:30:09,212
MATT: Okay.

711
00:30:09,212 --> 00:30:13,376
LIAM: I got a natural 20. Using Luck.

712
00:30:13,376 --> 00:30:18,417
MATT: Great. So the two twins up there on the
broom, as you kind of glance around the other

713
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:29,644
side, you both can see the branches themselves
occasionally will shift and curl up, almost like

714
00:30:29,644 --> 00:30:35,256
an arm recoiling, and then relax slowly back out
again,

715
00:30:35,256 --> 00:30:39,140
like a stretching arm held still for too long.

716
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:45,692
LAURA: Oh, shit. I think the tree is alive and not
in a normal plant sort of way.

717
00:30:45,692 --> 00:30:46,923
LIAM: Yeah.

718
00:30:46,923 --> 00:30:48,013
LAURA: Yeah.

719
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:51,481
MATT: You also notice some of the vines that are
wrapped around and kind of curled around these

720
00:30:51,481 --> 00:30:56,891
branches as well occasionally recoil and pull in
and shift and move up, it's like there's a whole

721
00:30:56,891 --> 00:31:03,018
ecosystem based around numerous forms of plant
life that cause this thing

722
00:31:03,018 --> 00:31:05,418
to almost act like a giant organism.

723
00:31:05,418 --> 00:31:07,199
LAURA: Fuck, I do not wanna get close to that
thing.

724
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,746
MARISHA: I know, that's intimidating.

725
00:31:08,746 --> 00:31:12,606
LIAM: I'm gonna rest my chin on my sister's
shoulder and just stare for a minute and say,

726
00:31:12,606 --> 00:31:17,300
you know, that bow is going to be reeeally cool.

727
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,312
LAURA: God, I hope so.

728
00:31:19,312 --> 00:31:21,632
LIAM: Yeah. Worth it.

729
00:31:21,632 --> 00:31:23,816
MARISHA: Still on my back, Scanlan, you wanna get
closer?

730
00:31:23,816 --> 00:31:28,976
SAM: I'm using my eight perception, I report to
the others, it's just a normal tree, guys.

731
00:31:28,976 --> 00:31:31,050
(All laugh.)

732
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:34,425
SAM: Nothing out of the ordinary, no movement,
nothing. It's safe.

733
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:39,171
LAURA: Thanks, Scanlan. Your eyes, your eyes...

734
00:31:39,171 --> 00:31:41,604
TRAVIS: Can I check myself for parasites?

735
00:31:41,604 --> 00:31:44,008
MATT: You find a number of them, actually.
They're delicious.

736
00:31:44,008 --> 00:31:47,298
(All laugh.)

737
00:31:47,298 --> 00:31:51,119
MATT: For the two of you that are below the
treeline, you don't get a grand view above,

738
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:55,070
it's too hard to see, but you guys make your way
close to the actual base of the tree?

739
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,829
LAURA: Ugh! No! What? The base of the fucking
tree?

740
00:31:56,829 --> 00:31:57,917
LIAM: No, no.

741
00:31:57,917 --> 00:31:59,578
LAURA: No fucking way, don't do that.

742
00:31:59,578 --> 00:32:01,623
TALIESIN: I'm gonna get close enough to at least
make out some detail.

743
00:32:01,623 --> 00:32:03,806
MARISHA: And I'll do kind of a tighter loop around
it.

744
00:32:03,806 --> 00:32:04,414
MATT: Okay.

745
00:32:04,414 --> 00:32:06,246
MARISHA: See if I can get any more details.

746
00:32:06,246 --> 00:32:09,481
MATT: All right. Percy, you have to get pretty
close to even get a view because of the density of

747
00:32:09,481 --> 00:32:13,494
the trees the closer you get to this. So you guys
are probably going to have to get within 20,

748
00:32:13,494 --> 00:32:17,170
30 feet to get a view of the exterior of the
large tree.

749
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,532
LIAM: That's a bad idea.

750
00:32:18,532 --> 00:32:20,381
LAURA: Yeah. Can we see him walking towards it?

751
00:32:20,381 --> 00:32:22,330
MATT: No, you have no view of them this high in
the canopy.

752
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:23,129
LAURA: Fuck.

753
00:32:23,129 --> 00:32:26,560
MATT: They're below the treeline. Percy,
as you get closer you begin to notice that the

754
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:32,898
actual roots of the tree almost come 10 feet up
before they merge with

755
00:32:32,898 --> 00:32:36,968
the outside of the tree itself, a number of--

756
00:32:36,968 --> 00:32:42,015
TALIESIN: Is it a solid trunk, or is it like a
combined trunk?

757
00:32:42,015 --> 00:32:48,512
MATT: It's a solid trunk in most of its places,
but there are swaths of vines that wrap around it

758
00:32:48,512 --> 00:32:54,553
and curl and create these giant, tight nets,
almost like a Rat King of tails across certain

759
00:32:54,553 --> 00:32:57,430
portions of its exterior near the base, and where
some of

760
00:32:57,430 --> 00:33:00,092
the roots join with the central tree trunk.

761
00:33:00,092 --> 00:33:03,771
TALIESIN: I'm gonna back up and try and find a
place to scan the ground,

762
00:33:03,771 --> 00:33:06,758
find a place to put a door for our mansion.

763
00:33:06,758 --> 00:33:07,764
MATT: Okay.

764
00:33:07,764 --> 00:33:08,772
TALIESIN: Safe.

765
00:33:08,772 --> 00:33:12,929
MATT: Okay, I mean, there are a number of areas
that are somewhat clear on the ground, but there

766
00:33:12,929 --> 00:33:19,294
is no-- All the landscape is coated with this
molasses-type material, even the bits that aren't

767
00:33:19,294 --> 00:33:24,101
submerged and are relatively shallow, there is
still that substance all across them.

768
00:33:24,101 --> 00:33:28,662
MARISHA: I was doing a tighter loop.

769
00:33:28,662 --> 00:33:30,032
MATT: Right.

770
00:33:30,032 --> 00:33:33,154
MARISHA: Of the tree, see if I can get any more
details that we haven't already seen.

771
00:33:33,154 --> 00:33:37,891
MATT: Okay. Keeping your eyes out as best you can
as you loop around a second time, you get closer,

772
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:43,206
no real change in what you're able to observe.
You have a higher detailed look at it, but once

773
00:33:43,206 --> 00:33:48,666
again, you see a number of these vine-clusters
around the base of some of these branches,

774
00:33:48,666 --> 00:33:52,002
you see elements where the bark has split and
sealed over and split again

775
00:33:52,002 --> 00:33:54,534
and just spills out more of this black filth.

776
00:33:54,534 --> 00:33:57,341
MARISHA: Okay.

777
00:33:57,341 --> 00:34:02,501
MATT: You aren't able to make out any sort of
other details about its surface.

778
00:34:02,501 --> 00:34:03,991
MARISHA: I fly back to the others.

779
00:34:03,991 --> 00:34:04,516
MATT: Okay.

780
00:34:04,516 --> 00:34:05,358
LAURA: Percy?

781
00:34:05,358 --> 00:34:06,166
TALIESIN: Yes?

782
00:34:06,166 --> 00:34:07,670
LAURA: Are you on the ground?

783
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,098
TALIESIN: No, but I'm close to it.

784
00:34:09,098 --> 00:34:12,040
LAURA: Do you see any sort of animal life around
the tree?

785
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,790
TALIESIN: Nothing, no.

786
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:23,827
LAURA: The only thing I've seen is actual branches
moving like arms. I think the tree's alive.

787
00:34:23,827 --> 00:34:27,520
TALIESIN: If I were animal life, I would live
beneath the surface.

788
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,022
LAURA: Like the trolls.

789
00:34:30,022 --> 00:34:37,757
TALIESIN: Like the trolls. I think there's quite
possibly things that live in the muck.

790
00:34:37,757 --> 00:34:40,262
Probably not on top of it.

791
00:34:40,262 --> 00:34:46,695
LAURA: Do you guys think maybe we should, um.
We should get in the mansion and have a nice

792
00:34:46,695 --> 00:34:49,685
little chat and figure out what the fuck we're
gonna do?

793
00:34:49,685 --> 00:34:52,196
SAM: Sure. Sounds good to me.

794
00:34:52,196 --> 00:34:53,915
TRAVIS: How do I not become a gorilla anymore?

795
00:34:53,915 --> 00:34:54,906
LAURA: Yeah?

796
00:34:54,906 --> 00:34:56,352
LIAM: Yeah. We want to be at full strength.

797
00:34:56,352 --> 00:34:57,764
MATT: You don't.

798
00:34:57,764 --> 00:34:59,141
MARISHA: It's up to me.

799
00:34:59,141 --> 00:35:00,323
LIAM: Don't run in willy-nilly.

800
00:35:00,323 --> 00:35:02,023
TRAVIS: I look at Keyleth and I go--

801
00:35:02,023 --> 00:35:04,114
MATT: She doesn't see you, 'cause she's way above
the trees and you're just kind of down in the

802
00:35:04,114 --> 00:35:06,969
forest as a gorilla going--

803
00:35:06,969 --> 00:35:08,833
TRAVIS: I'm on the ground?

804
00:35:08,833 --> 00:35:12,752
MATT: You're not on the ground, you're up in the
actual tree top.

805
00:35:12,752 --> 00:35:19,498
SAM: While we still have a, I'll phone down to Vex
and Vax and Percy and say, while we still have a

806
00:35:19,498 --> 00:35:25,789
giant eagle, is there any point to us, to me and
Kiki scanning back to where those trolls were and

807
00:35:25,789 --> 00:35:29,515
just making sure they're not following us or
anything?

808
00:35:29,515 --> 00:35:32,252
TALIESIN: No, although if you find a log
approximately two feet thick,

809
00:35:32,252 --> 00:35:34,170
I could certainly use that.

810
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:35,148
SAM: A log?

811
00:35:35,148 --> 00:35:36,809
TALIESIN: A log, about two feet thick.

812
00:35:36,809 --> 00:35:38,063
LAURA: About how long, though?

813
00:35:38,063 --> 00:35:42,044
TALIESIN: Doesn't matter.

814
00:35:42,044 --> 00:35:46,750
LAURA: You wanna fly down? We fly down, I take the
broom and try to find a log.

815
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,063
LIAM: Yeah, you're in control.

816
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:48,909
LAURA: All right.

817
00:35:48,909 --> 00:35:53,768
MATT: All right, so the two of you kind of-- make
a perception check.

818
00:35:53,768 --> 00:35:56,526
LAURA: (laughs) Yeah.

819
00:35:56,526 --> 00:35:57,631
LIAM: Seventeen.

820
00:35:57,631 --> 00:35:59,520
LAURA: That's interesting. I got fifteen.

821
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,317
MATT: Okay, uh.

822
00:36:01,317 --> 00:36:03,759
LIAM: What a lackluster okay.

823
00:36:03,759 --> 00:36:05,353
LAURA: Yeah, okay.

824
00:36:05,353 --> 00:36:12,593
MATT: It takes you guys the better part of an hour
to finally find a piece of abandoned dead tree

825
00:36:12,593 --> 00:36:15,036
husk from which you'll be able to carve a piece
that

826
00:36:15,036 --> 00:36:17,276
matches the description of what 
Percy's requesting.

827
00:36:17,276 --> 00:36:18,488
LAURA: All right.

828
00:36:18,488 --> 00:36:22,431
MATT: Requires some cleaning, it is very thick
with the actual tar, but you do manage to bring it

829
00:36:22,431 --> 00:36:26,430
back to him. A little larger than what you wanted,
but it can be carved down.

830
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:29,948
TALIESIN: It's fine, I've got a thought,
so I'm gonna try something.

831
00:36:29,948 --> 00:36:32,845
MARISHA: I drop Grog's polymorph and my eagle
form.

832
00:36:32,845 --> 00:36:34,181
SAM: (screams as though falling)

833
00:36:34,181 --> 00:36:38,102
MARISHA: ...after I've landed.

834
00:36:38,102 --> 00:36:39,569
SAM: Oh, okay.

835
00:36:39,569 --> 00:36:41,937
MATT: Okay. You are back to your regular Grog
self.

836
00:36:41,937 --> 00:36:49,439
TRAVIS: My pants are down, as my hand was behind
my bottom, just contemplating flinging some poo.

837
00:36:49,439 --> 00:36:53,264
MATT: All right, and in that brief moment all of a
sudden you are, well, some of your sense have come

838
00:36:53,264 --> 00:36:56,442
to you. Not much else has changed other than your
physicality, but...

839
00:36:56,442 --> 00:36:57,495
TRAVIS: Hi guys.

840
00:36:57,495 --> 00:36:58,661
LAURA: Hi Grog.

841
00:36:58,661 --> 00:37:01,589
LIAM: I think a little bit actually got out,
buddy.

842
00:37:01,589 --> 00:37:05,935
LAURA: Gross! Come on.

843
00:37:05,935 --> 00:37:10,581
TRAVIS: It didn't, don't worry.

844
00:37:10,581 --> 00:37:12,879
LAURA: So foul.

845
00:37:12,879 --> 00:37:17,948
MATT: All right, so. You've all managed to
reconvene a little ways off from the base of this

846
00:37:17,948 --> 00:37:22,739
large tree. What do you wish to do?

847
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:24,578
SAM: Should we--

848
00:37:24,578 --> 00:37:26,769
LAURA: (singing) Mansion it up!

849
00:37:26,769 --> 00:37:27,566
SAM: Yeah?

850
00:37:27,566 --> 00:37:30,984
TALIESIN: I could use some sleep, and I've got a
little thing to work on for the moment.

851
00:37:30,984 --> 00:37:31,712
SAM: Okay.

852
00:37:31,712 --> 00:37:34,402
LIAM: What are you doing with this log, Percival?
What is this for?

853
00:37:34,402 --> 00:37:35,692
MARISHA: Is this what we were talking about that
time?

854
00:37:35,692 --> 00:37:36,679
TALIESIN: Swamp shoes.

855
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:37,438
MARISHA: Swamp shoes.

856
00:37:37,438 --> 00:37:38,503
LAURA: Swamp shoes?

857
00:37:38,503 --> 00:37:39,776
TALIESIN: I think some swamp shoes might not be a
terrible idea.

858
00:37:39,776 --> 00:37:41,237
MARISHA: I can help you with those.

859
00:37:41,237 --> 00:37:42,983
TALIESIN: Thank you. Swamp shoes.

860
00:37:42,983 --> 00:37:44,152
LAURA: So you can walk like me?

861
00:37:44,152 --> 00:37:48,631
TALIESIN: Yes. I mean, not quickly, it won't help
you walk quickly, it's not necessarily the most

862
00:37:48,631 --> 00:37:52,415
stealthy thing on earth, but you won't drop two
feet into the muck every time you take a step.

863
00:37:52,415 --> 00:37:53,264
LAURA: That's good.

864
00:37:53,264 --> 00:37:57,362
TRAVIS: I've got a question. Can one of us that
can turn into things go in the muck?

865
00:37:57,362 --> 00:37:59,097
LAURA: Oh.

866
00:37:59,097 --> 00:38:01,928
TALIESIN: Maybe.

867
00:38:01,928 --> 00:38:09,255
LAURA: I feel like, is it bad? Do we get any kind
of bad vibe, bad energy off the muck?

868
00:38:09,255 --> 00:38:11,567
SAM: Other than it being black magic?

869
00:38:11,567 --> 00:38:15,465
MATT: Roll an insight check.

870
00:38:15,465 --> 00:38:17,370
TALIESIN: The muck is unhappy to be there.

871
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:18,929
MARISHA: That mud looked at me the wrong way.

872
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:21,211
LAURA: No, but I mean, what if it makes us sad to
be around it?

873
00:38:21,211 --> 00:38:22,668
TALIESIN: It does make us sad to be around it.

874
00:38:22,668 --> 00:38:26,468
LAURA: Nineteen. Nineteen.

875
00:38:26,468 --> 00:38:29,154
MATT: Those are some nice boots you're wearing,
you're probably gonna have to get a new pair when

876
00:38:29,154 --> 00:38:38,549
all this is over. It stinks, it's sticky,
the muck itself is probably not a very nice

877
00:38:38,549 --> 00:38:43,813
conversationalist. It doesn't also from what you
can tell appear to be sentient or give you any

878
00:38:43,813 --> 00:38:46,179
kind of bad vibe that you can pick up.

879
00:38:46,179 --> 00:38:47,572
LAURA: Okay.

880
00:38:47,572 --> 00:38:49,008
TALIESIN: It's just muck.

881
00:38:49,094 --> 00:38:50,133
MATT: From looking at it. It is muck.

882
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,155
TRAVIS: I mean, I'll go in and--

883
00:38:51,155 --> 00:38:51,608
MARISHA: I can go.

884
00:38:51,608 --> 00:38:52,018
TRAVIS: Yeah?

885
00:38:52,018 --> 00:38:52,805
LAURA: Stanky-stank.

886
00:38:52,805 --> 00:38:53,520
MATT: Stanky-stank.

887
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,079
MARISHA: Sounds fun.

888
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:56,828
TRAVIS: What are you gonna turn into?

889
00:38:56,828 --> 00:39:01,614
MARISHA: Something that burrows. I guess I
technically could've taken a short rest, correct?

890
00:39:01,614 --> 00:39:02,988
MATT: Not yet, no.

891
00:39:02,988 --> 00:39:03,973
TALIESIN: We haven't yet.

892
00:39:03,973 --> 00:39:05,106
SAM: So we're doing this now?

893
00:39:05,106 --> 00:39:07,408
MARISHA: In the time we're just chilling? Okay,
well, I'll take a short rest.

894
00:39:07,408 --> 00:39:09,471
TALIESIN: Let's take a long rest, I mean.

895
00:39:09,471 --> 00:39:10,837
SAM: Well, no, I--

896
00:39:10,837 --> 00:39:12,357
MARISHA: I just want to take a short rest, just--

897
00:39:12,357 --> 00:39:15,763
MATT: A short rest is about half an hour or so.
Half an hour to an hour.

898
00:39:15,763 --> 00:39:17,716
MARISHA: Yeah, just enough time, and then I'm
gonna

899
00:39:17,716 --> 00:39:20,541
turn into an earth elemental and I'm gonna
swan dive--

900
00:39:20,541 --> 00:39:21,498
SAM: Wait, wait!

901
00:39:21,498 --> 00:39:22,566
LAURA: Swan dive?

902
00:39:22,566 --> 00:39:25,242
MATT: We'll get to that. Because as you take your
short rest and

903
00:39:25,242 --> 00:39:29,341
begin sitting amongst the ground or
the bough of the trees--

904
00:39:29,341 --> 00:39:32,174
MARISHA: I thought we were in the mansion.

905
00:39:32,174 --> 00:39:33,930
MATT: No, the mansion hasn't been cast yet.

906
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:34,966
MARISHA: Oh.

907
00:39:34,966 --> 00:39:40,031
MATT: So as you're resting, here amongst the tree
tops--

908
00:39:40,031 --> 00:39:41,668
LAURA: We're in the tree tops.

909
00:39:41,668 --> 00:39:45,730
MATT: Yeah. The branches begin to sag ever so
slowly.

910
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:46,790
LAURA: Shit.

911
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:54,487
MATT: And particularly Keyleth and Percy,
actually Grog as well, you begin to feel the

912
00:39:54,487 --> 00:40:00,662
branches slowly almost trying to push you off
them, like you sort of slide forward.

913
00:40:00,662 --> 00:40:02,311
MARISHA: Did I say something? I don't know.

914
00:40:02,311 --> 00:40:06,383
TALIESIN: No, you didn't say anything.

915
00:40:06,383 --> 00:40:11,873
LAURA: Trees, you're so lovely, even though you're
covered in this black stuff, I can tell that you

916
00:40:11,873 --> 00:40:14,471
have really good personalities.

917
00:40:14,471 --> 00:40:16,371
MARISHA: You've clearly been moisturizing.

918
00:40:16,371 --> 00:40:17,644
TRAVIS: You really don't think that's--

919
00:40:17,644 --> 00:40:19,435
MATT: All the branches begin to slowly sag down.

920
00:40:19,435 --> 00:40:21,532
LAURA: Shit! I push off, we're flying, we're
hovering.

921
00:40:21,532 --> 00:40:23,149
MATT: And you guys all begin to slide down--

922
00:40:23,149 --> 00:40:24,906
TALIESIN: I'm going to make a jump to another
tree.

923
00:40:24,906 --> 00:40:26,035
MARISHA: Yeah, I do the same.

924
00:40:26,035 --> 00:40:27,906
MATT: Okay, make an athletics check, both of you.

925
00:40:27,906 --> 00:40:29,143
SAM: I will too.

926
00:40:29,143 --> 00:40:30,744
LAURA: What about you, Grog?

927
00:40:30,744 --> 00:40:31,870
MARISHA: Oh my god. This is horrifying.

928
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:35,057
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

929
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:36,097
TRAVIS: All right, I'll try.

930
00:40:36,097 --> 00:40:37,067
MARISHA: Ten.

931
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:38,772
TALIESIN: My potion has worn off, hasn't it?

932
00:40:38,772 --> 00:40:40,626
MATT: At this point in time? How long does it
last?

933
00:40:40,626 --> 00:40:42,570
TALIESIN: One hour.

934
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:44,915
MATT: Yeah.

935
00:40:44,915 --> 00:40:47,622
TRAVIS: I frenzy raged last time.

936
00:40:47,622 --> 00:40:50,157
MATT: Yeah, so you have disadvantage.

937
00:40:50,157 --> 00:40:51,812
SAM: You're dead, sir.

938
00:40:51,812 --> 00:40:54,408
LAURA: Oh no.

939
00:40:54,408 --> 00:40:55,842
TRAVIS: Don't worry about it.

940
00:40:55,842 --> 00:40:57,869
LAURA: Oh my god, you rolled 19 twice in a row.

941
00:40:57,869 --> 00:40:59,035
TRAVIS: Yeah, 19 and 16.

942
00:40:59,035 --> 00:41:00,198
LAURA: Oh, okay.

943
00:41:00,198 --> 00:41:01,286
TRAVIS: 24.

944
00:41:01,286 --> 00:41:03,342
MATT: Okay, so you leap onto another tree branch.

945
00:41:03,342 --> 00:41:04,698
SAM: I got a 23.

946
00:41:04,698 --> 00:41:06,998
MATT: You also leap after and actually land next
to Grog.

947
00:41:06,998 --> 00:41:07,764
SAM: Hey, buddy!

948
00:41:07,764 --> 00:41:09,120
GROG: Hey, pal!

949
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,206
MATT: What did you get, Percy?

950
00:41:10,206 --> 00:41:11,041
TALIESIN: Seven.

951
00:41:11,041 --> 00:41:11,864
LAURA: Oh no.

952
00:41:11,864 --> 00:41:12,559
MARISHA: 10.

953
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:13,354
LAURA: Oh no!

954
00:41:13,354 --> 00:41:15,612
MATT: You both reach, leap for the branch,
but you're a good foot and a half, two feet

955
00:41:15,612 --> 00:41:17,627
short, and as your fingers catch the edge--

956
00:41:17,627 --> 00:41:18,666
MARISHA: Percy, catch me!

957
00:41:18,666 --> 00:41:24,502
MATT: It's slick, and both of you go plummeting
about 15 feet to the ground. You both suffer four

958
00:41:24,502 --> 00:41:28,445
points of falling damage as you catch yourself on
the ground, kind of jamming your ankles a little

959
00:41:28,445 --> 00:41:35,602
bit. There's a (splash) of liquid as you impact
and the lower patch goes partway up your calf,

960
00:41:35,602 --> 00:41:38,511
almost to your knee, as you hit and you have to
wiggle to try and--

961
00:41:38,511 --> 00:41:41,276
TALIESIN: I want the mansion, now.

962
00:41:41,276 --> 00:41:42,083
SAM: Okay.

963
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:45,831
LAURA: Can we drop the endless rope down, say,
hey, grab on.

964
00:41:45,831 --> 00:41:46,841
MATT: Yeah.

965
00:41:46,841 --> 00:41:48,880
LAURA: And try to yank 'em back up into the tree.

966
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,822
MATT: Okay. You guys take the rope and begin to
pull yourself up.

967
00:41:50,822 --> 00:41:52,530
You feel your branch begin to slowly--

968
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:53,684
LAURA: Oh, I was on the broom.

969
00:41:53,684 --> 00:41:54,809
MATT: You're still on the broom this whole time?

970
00:41:54,809 --> 00:41:56,785
LAURA: I've been on the broom, yeah, I don't wanna
stand on anything.

971
00:41:56,785 --> 00:41:59,073
MATT: All right. Then you manage to get the rope
down, you guys grab onto the rope and you pull

972
00:41:59,073 --> 00:42:06,319
them ever so slowly out of the muck. It's a lot of
weight. I need you to make a strength check.

973
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:10,103
LAURA: Can I tie the rope off on a branch?

974
00:42:10,103 --> 00:42:11,312
TALIESIN: It won't hold.

975
00:42:11,312 --> 00:42:12,659
LIAM: Can I help?

976
00:42:12,659 --> 00:42:17,031
MATT: Sure. Sure, we can do that. You don't need a
strength check to tie the rope off, we'll just

977
00:42:17,031 --> 00:42:24,267
take it. You guys manage to pull yourselves at
least out of the muck, however, you've gotta climb

978
00:42:24,267 --> 00:42:27,630
up the rope to try and get back in the branches?

979
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:28,902
TALIESIN: I'm just gonna hold on.

980
00:42:28,902 --> 00:42:30,361
LAURA: We just need to get in the fucking
mansion.

981
00:42:30,361 --> 00:42:31,544
TALIESIN: We just need to get in the mansion.

982
00:42:31,544 --> 00:42:32,708
MARISHA: Yeah, can we have the mansion?

983
00:42:32,708 --> 00:42:34,237
SAM: Okay, I'll do the mansion.

984
00:42:34,237 --> 00:42:35,769
MARISHA: I mean, we can still come in and out of
the mansion.

985
00:42:35,769 --> 00:42:36,796
SAM: Yeah, that's true, that's true.

986
00:42:36,796 --> 00:42:38,543
MATT: All right.

987
00:42:38,543 --> 00:42:44,364
SAM: I will cast the mansion. I will sing the song
to conjure it.

988
00:42:44,364 --> 00:42:51,149
(Sings) Home, home on the range,
where the trees are acting real strange,

989
00:42:51,149 --> 00:42:56,172
where chickens are pecked, 
Vex shoots me in the neck,

990
00:42:56,172 --> 00:42:59,378
and the hot tub is filled with grenades.

991
00:42:59,378 --> 00:43:02,635
(All laugh and applaud.)

992
00:43:02,635 --> 00:43:04,796
MATT: Well done.

993
00:43:04,796 --> 00:43:09,203
TRAVIS: I'm sick, don't make me laugh that hard.

994
00:43:09,203 --> 00:43:17,713
MATT: All right. With that, Scanlan, after leaping
onto the next branch, you create the doorway into

995
00:43:17,713 --> 00:43:21,968
the mansion up in the trees. You guys all slowly
eventually climb back up and get to where the

996
00:43:21,968 --> 00:43:27,118
entrance is, and each member of Vox Machina
currently present leap into the mansion,

997
00:43:27,118 --> 00:43:29,817
to safety, where it's seemingly much more clean,
though

998
00:43:29,817 --> 00:43:33,388
you are dragging clumps of this liquid on
the main carpet.

999
00:43:33,388 --> 00:43:34,310
TRAVIS: That's good.

1000
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:35,381
TALIESIN: It's fine.

1001
00:43:35,381 --> 00:43:37,311
SAM: I command my servants to wipe our feet.

1002
00:43:37,311 --> 00:43:40,831
TRAVIS: Whoa whoa whoa, I'm sure you want to test
the gunk, right, Percy?

1003
00:43:40,831 --> 00:43:42,271
LAURA: Yeah, we should--

1004
00:43:42,271 --> 00:43:43,449
SAM: Oh, go out and test it?

1005
00:43:43,449 --> 00:43:46,646
TRAVIS: Is it flammable, is it poisonous,
is it acidic?

1006
00:43:46,646 --> 00:43:50,620
MARISHA: I take my fire hands and I see if I can
light the gunk on fire.

1007
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:56,371
MATT: Okay. As you bring it near, the gunk does
not burn. You see one little pssh as a bubble

1008
00:43:56,371 --> 00:44:01,663
bursts and there is a little burst of sulfurous
flame, but it burns away in an instant, the actual

1009
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:03,491
liquid itself does not catch.

1010
00:44:03,491 --> 00:44:08,707
MARISHA: Okay. I start taking my short rest.

1011
00:44:08,707 --> 00:44:10,186
MATT: All right.

1012
00:44:10,186 --> 00:44:12,302
LAURA: Should one of us lick it?

1013
00:44:12,302 --> 00:44:14,963
TALIESIN: Sure.

1014
00:44:14,963 --> 00:44:17,344
SAM: Grog?

1015
00:44:17,344 --> 00:44:20,650
TRAVIS: I take a pinky-smear--

1016
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:22,772
LIAM: Give it to Mikey, he'll try anything.

1017
00:44:22,772 --> 00:44:30,028
TRAVIS: Like a droplet, right, I stick my tongue
out, and I touch it to my tongue.

1018
00:44:30,028 --> 00:44:36,224
MATT: It resembles, and it's only familiar to you
because you've tried this before, it's like

1019
00:44:36,224 --> 00:44:43,299
tasting the filthiest copper coin you've ever held
in a pocket before. It has that kind of metallic

1020
00:44:43,299 --> 00:44:50,793
residue to it, but also this kind of earthy
griminess where it's probably been devoured and

1021
00:44:50,793 --> 00:44:53,374
digested by a number of creatures before it found
its way--

1022
00:44:53,374 --> 00:44:54,131
LAURA: Ew!

1023
00:44:54,131 --> 00:44:55,945
TRAVIS: I detect a note of digestive tract.

1024
00:44:55,945 --> 00:44:57,963
MATT: It is not pleasant by any means.

1025
00:44:57,963 --> 00:45:01,112
LAURA: Do you feel evil? More than usual?

1026
00:45:01,112 --> 00:45:03,386
TRAVIS: I raise my hand-- no.

1027
00:45:03,386 --> 00:45:05,974
LAURA: Okay.

1028
00:45:05,974 --> 00:45:08,636
TALIESIN: Give me a little bit and I'll do
something to it. I don't really know what I can

1029
00:45:08,636 --> 00:45:10,210
tell you, but I'll take a look.

1030
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:12,957
LAURA: Hold out your hand, then.

1031
00:45:12,957 --> 00:45:20,863
TALIESIN: Thank you. I need that tree as well,
let's take that down to-- want to help me with

1032
00:45:20,863 --> 00:45:23,742
this before your nap or after?

1033
00:45:23,742 --> 00:45:27,740
MARISHA: I dunno. After.

1034
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:29,924
TALIESIN: All right, I'll start on it, then you
can help when you finish.

1035
00:45:29,924 --> 00:45:32,065
MATT: All right, so you guys begin...

1036
00:45:32,065 --> 00:45:34,469
TALIESIN: I'm gonna go work for a little bit.

1037
00:45:34,469 --> 00:45:37,355
MATT: Okay. What are the rest of you doing?

1038
00:45:37,355 --> 00:45:44,077
LIAM: I'm gonna hobble past Vex and say, you know,
I think that broom is not as well-suited for, um,

1039
00:45:44,077 --> 00:45:51,978
men. I think you might have done Gern a favor.
I've just taken a very long spin class.

1040
00:45:51,978 --> 00:45:55,355
I sort of tenderly walk past.

1041
00:45:55,355 --> 00:45:58,420
LAURA: Well, I have a seat, sorry I didn't think
about.

1042
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:01,617
LIAM: Oh dear.

1043
00:46:01,617 --> 00:46:05,843
MATT: So Vax goes to rest his bruised arch.

1044
00:46:05,843 --> 00:46:11,136
(All laugh.)

1045
00:46:11,136 --> 00:46:13,137
MARISHA: Is that enough time?

1046
00:46:13,137 --> 00:46:14,617
MATT: You're making those--

1047
00:46:14,617 --> 00:46:15,892
TALIESIN: I'm gonna make swamp shoes.

1048
00:46:15,892 --> 00:46:17,299
MATT: Okay, that's gonna take you--

1049
00:46:17,299 --> 00:46:19,976
TALIESIN: They're very simple, but yes, I have to
make a lot of them.

1050
00:46:19,976 --> 00:46:21,876
MATT: You have to make a pair for most everybody
here.

1051
00:46:21,876 --> 00:46:26,226
TALIESIN: And I'm going to be enlisting her help,
it's literally just thin slices, I'm not making

1052
00:46:26,226 --> 00:46:28,296
them super nice, I'm just--

1053
00:46:28,296 --> 00:46:30,137
MARISHA: I druidcraft the shit out of those.

1054
00:46:30,137 --> 00:46:31,951
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm gonna have her--

1055
00:46:31,951 --> 00:46:34,614
LAURA: I'm gonna come out of the door with you.

1056
00:46:34,614 --> 00:46:36,803
TALIESIN: That's pretty much what I'm doing other
than sleeping.

1057
00:46:36,803 --> 00:46:40,196
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make four tinkering
checks.

1058
00:46:40,196 --> 00:46:49,245
SAM: I'm gonna inspire him once with an
inspirational quote.

1059
00:46:49,245 --> 00:46:52,119
You have to look through the
rain to see the rainbow.

1060
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:54,604
(All laugh.)

1061
00:46:54,604 --> 00:46:56,633
TRAVIS: I gotta leave, I can't--

1062
00:46:56,633 --> 00:47:01,956
TALIESIN: I have to take a negative 10 for that,
like that really removes 10?

1063
00:47:01,956 --> 00:47:04,126
MARISHA: Did you get that from a fortune cookie,
where'd you get that?

1064
00:47:04,126 --> 00:47:04,884
TRAVIS: I can't be here when this happens.

1065
00:47:04,884 --> 00:47:08,953
SAM: Hey, pal. Life is what happens when you're
making other plans.

1066
00:47:08,953 --> 00:47:13,620
If plan A doesn't work,
there's still 25 letters left in the alphabet.

1067
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:14,739
LAURA: Oh, wow.

1068
00:47:14,739 --> 00:47:15,821
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

1069
00:47:15,821 --> 00:47:17,498
LAURA: That's three inspirations you've just given
him.

1070
00:47:17,498 --> 00:47:18,787
TALIESIN: Let's burn that page.

1071
00:47:18,787 --> 00:47:20,871
MATT: That's borderline Lisa Frank quotes here,
this is...

1072
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:23,673
LIAM: Kill him!

1073
00:47:23,673 --> 00:47:27,828
TALIESIN: Can I remove that extra two from your
charisma? I'm gonna wipe it out.

1074
00:47:27,828 --> 00:47:30,317
MATT: Yeah, all that reading finally goes to
shit.

1075
00:47:30,317 --> 00:47:32,814
SAM: It was my footprints you saw.

1076
00:47:32,814 --> 00:47:35,733
TALIESIN: It's proficiency bonus, plus dex.

1077
00:47:35,733 --> 00:47:37,170
MATT: Yes, go for it.

1078
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:39,583
SAM: I was carrying you all along.

1079
00:47:39,583 --> 00:47:45,978
TALIESIN: I hate you. I hate everything that you
stand for. Oh, this is nice. This is, um.

1080
00:47:45,978 --> 00:47:48,890
MATT: Remember, you don't have to use the
inspiration dice if you don't want to.

1081
00:47:48,890 --> 00:47:50,272
TALIESIN: It's two 26s.

1082
00:47:50,272 --> 00:47:51,310
MATT: Okay.

1083
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:55,778
TALIESIN: I'm keeping the inspiration dice.
And, let's see, and two 19s.

1084
00:47:55,778 --> 00:48:01,311
MATT: All righty. Yeah, you guys take the better
part of the next hour to make some loosely

1085
00:48:01,311 --> 00:48:06,912
functional swamp shoes. They'll get you a short
distance, they're not gonna last you a long time.

1086
00:48:06,912 --> 00:48:09,075
TALIESIN: They're not pretty. They're made of
rope.

1087
00:48:09,075 --> 00:48:12,176
MATT: Yeah. All right. So you finish your short
rest.

1088
00:48:12,176 --> 00:48:14,289
MARISHA: I really wanna swan dive into the muck.

1089
00:48:14,289 --> 00:48:18,218
LAURA: I feel like, Keyleth, a swan dive is maybe
not the best idea because I feel like it'll make a

1090
00:48:18,218 --> 00:48:20,847
lot of noise. Maybe nice and quiet.

1091
00:48:20,847 --> 00:48:26,359
MARISHA: If I tighten my abs and keep my feet
together, it shouldn't make much noise at all.

1092
00:48:26,359 --> 00:48:27,798
TALIESIN: You've been watching a lot of Olympics.

1093
00:48:27,798 --> 00:48:29,691
MARISHA: I have been watching a lot of Olympics.

1094
00:48:29,691 --> 00:48:33,403
LIAM: I come back in with a big bag of ice.

1095
00:48:33,403 --> 00:48:36,800
MATT: And two spirits trying to hold it for you.

1096
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,042
TRAVIS: Did we take a long rest or just a short
rest?

1097
00:48:39,042 --> 00:48:41,275
LAURA: Short rest right now so Keyleth can go into
the muck.

1098
00:48:41,275 --> 00:48:43,377
TALIESIN: I'm going for a full long rest after my
crap.

1099
00:48:43,377 --> 00:48:47,075
LAURA: I'm gonna go outside with her and just
hover on the broom to keep an eye.

1100
00:48:47,075 --> 00:48:51,898
SAM: I'm going out as well and I'm just sort of
shuffling in place and moving.

1101
00:48:51,898 --> 00:48:53,386
LAURA: Do you wanna hang out on the broom with
me?

1102
00:48:53,386 --> 00:48:54,969
SAM: Oh yes, that would be better.

1103
00:48:54,969 --> 00:48:56,915
MATT: All right, so the two of you on the broom.
Grog, what are you doing?

1104
00:48:56,915 --> 00:49:00,402
TRAVIS: I'm going into the kitchen with the
Titanstone Knuckles,

1105
00:49:00,402 --> 00:49:03,487
and I'm gonna start hitting things.

1106
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:05,230
LAURA: Wow, Grog's getting aggressive.

1107
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:08,819
TRAVIS: Well, I wanna see if I can upgrade the
knuckles, so I'm gonna start using them.

1108
00:49:08,819 --> 00:49:11,026
LAURA: Oh, smart. Smart.

1109
00:49:11,026 --> 00:49:14,807
SAM: I have a training basement, but okay, sure.

1110
00:49:14,807 --> 00:49:16,867
TALIESIN: And there's food.

1111
00:49:16,867 --> 00:49:19,923
MATT: You guys make your way to the front door,
in the distance you can hear a series of dull

1112
00:49:19,923 --> 00:49:25,583
thuds, bangs, cracks, and various sounds as Grog
begins to just punch his way through the entirety

1113
00:49:25,583 --> 00:49:26,629
of your mansion's kitchen.

1114
00:49:26,629 --> 00:49:28,140
LAURA: Do you wanna check on that?

1115
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:29,385
SAM: Seems like it's normal.

1116
00:49:29,385 --> 00:49:32,230
LAURA: All right.

1117
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:37,479
MATT: You doubt you'd ever see a fully dominated
spiritual servant look nervous, yet at this moment

1118
00:49:37,479 --> 00:49:43,450
you have about 17 of them all just going
(high-pitched whine).

1119
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:45,176
You just tear through the vicinity.

1120
00:49:45,176 --> 00:49:46,487
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1121
00:49:46,487 --> 00:49:49,464
MATT: You're trying desperately to finish up your
short rest, as you get up, you hear this noise as

1122
00:49:49,464 --> 00:49:52,822
well as you guys make your way to the front door.
You're left to try and finish up this project,

1123
00:49:52,822 --> 00:49:55,895
probably for the next 20 minutes or so,
while they go ahead and attempt this process.

1124
00:49:55,895 --> 00:49:58,047
Vax, you're resting up your loins with ice.

1125
00:49:58,047 --> 00:50:03,084
LIAM: No, I mean, I'm gonna take my bag of ice and
I'm gonna sit on the doorjamb and watch them go.

1126
00:50:03,084 --> 00:50:05,565
And just see if they need help, but I'll
stay here if I can.

1127
00:50:05,565 --> 00:50:08,576
MATT: All right. You.

1128
00:50:08,576 --> 00:50:11,900
LAURA: Scanlan, do you wanna actually sit on my
lap so you don't have to suffer through the

1129
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:14,415
indignity that Vax just did?

1130
00:50:14,415 --> 00:50:17,212
SAM: Yes, that would be lovely, thank you.

1131
00:50:17,212 --> 00:50:18,860
MATT: All right, so as you guys step out,
Keyleth.

1132
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:20,526
SAM: Will you tell me a story?

1133
00:50:20,526 --> 00:50:22,246
LAURA: Whatever you want, darling.

1134
00:50:22,302 --> 00:50:27,953
MATT: Keyleth, as you step off of the tree branch,
are you gonna climb down

1135
00:50:27,953 --> 00:50:29,484
or just leap down into the muck?

1136
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:36,703
MARISHA: I swan-dive. I take a minute to compose
myself. And then--

1137
00:50:36,703 --> 00:50:37,847
LAURA: You're earth elemental?

1138
00:50:37,847 --> 00:50:40,892
MARISHA: --as gracefully as possible, pull like a
Pocahontas,

1139
00:50:40,892 --> 00:50:44,385
and then turn into the earth elemental
as I dive in.

1140
00:50:44,385 --> 00:50:45,485
TALIESIN: Sail!

1141
00:50:45,485 --> 00:50:46,520
MARISHA: Sail!

1142
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:52,131
MATT: All right, as you do, your form suddenly
ripples and extends out into the form of your

1143
00:50:52,131 --> 00:50:59,841
elemental body. You slam into the surface and sink
down below. You guys see a slight (burble sound)

1144
00:50:59,841 --> 00:51:09,632
in the liquid, and it leaves this sort of crater
of splash that slowly closes up over with no sign

1145
00:51:09,632 --> 00:51:11,769
of Keyleth now visible on the surface.

1146
00:51:11,769 --> 00:51:16,447
LAURA: I'm gonna hand Vax the endless rope and
say, you might just wanna drop that down to the

1147
00:51:16,447 --> 00:51:19,191
muck so she can get out if she needs it. Maybe.
Like fish for her.

1148
00:51:19,191 --> 00:51:21,899
LIAM: Yeah, I go and I tie one end of it to the
heaviest piece

1149
00:51:21,899 --> 00:51:24,553
of furniture I can find in the
foyer.

1150
00:51:24,553 --> 00:51:29,494
MATT: All right. No heavy furniture per se,
but there are a series of large marble pillars

1151
00:51:29,494 --> 00:51:32,784
that are load-bearing within the interior,
and that's probably your best bet, so you go

1152
00:51:32,784 --> 00:51:34,411
ahead and wrap the rope around that.

1153
00:51:34,411 --> 00:51:36,619
LIAM: Yes, I use the swirly-whirly knot.

1154
00:51:36,619 --> 00:51:40,662
MATT: Great. The one that Pike taught you from her
sailing days.

1155
00:51:40,662 --> 00:51:50,875
MARISHA: I start to earthglide, breaststroking
through the mud under the swamp to the tree.

1156
00:51:50,875 --> 00:51:52,391
LAURA: To the tree, you're going to the tree?

1157
00:51:52,391 --> 00:51:54,394
MARISHA: I'm heading towards it.

1158
00:51:54,394 --> 00:51:55,464
SAM: Wait, hold up.

1159
00:51:55,464 --> 00:51:58,617
MATT: Swimming through the tar itself is a slowing
process even as an earth elemental. Earthgliding

1160
00:51:58,617 --> 00:52:04,902
would mean going subterranean to where the actual
physical earth and soil is what you can traverse

1161
00:52:04,902 --> 00:52:08,195
through. The tar is not natural in comparison to
your elemental form,

1162
00:52:08,195 --> 00:52:10,532
so you'd have to go beneath the actual bog.

1163
00:52:10,532 --> 00:52:13,168
MARISHA: How much further down is it?

1164
00:52:13,168 --> 00:52:17,939
MATT: I'd say it's probably anywhere from three to
five feet, depending on certain things, that's to

1165
00:52:17,939 --> 00:52:20,818
get past how much of it has seeped into the
ground.

1166
00:52:20,818 --> 00:52:22,555
MARISHA: Okay, then I go down.

1167
00:52:22,555 --> 00:52:25,192
MATT: Okay. You go down, and you have to get lower
the closer you get to it, as the actual seep,

1168
00:52:25,192 --> 00:52:34,904
the actual depth in which this substance seems to
have penetrated the dirt gets lower and lower.

1169
00:52:34,904 --> 00:52:39,821
You begin to move through as you glide in the
darkness.

1170
00:52:39,821 --> 00:52:42,157
SAM: You know what, we should've definitely tied
that rope to her before--

1171
00:52:42,157 --> 00:52:45,837
LAURA: Yeah, before she went in, yeah yeah yeah.

1172
00:52:45,837 --> 00:52:49,347
MARISHA: I wanna use my tremor-sense too to just
be aware.

1173
00:52:49,347 --> 00:52:55,531
MATT: Yeah, every now and then you feel a twitch,
a large twitch in the ground, and you kind of

1174
00:52:55,531 --> 00:53:01,701
shoulder-charger into what seems to be a large
root that is dug into the ground. And you start

1175
00:53:01,701 --> 00:53:06,300
finding little pockets here and there beneath
these roots of that awful tar-like substance that

1176
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:14,223
have just been pushed into the ground like these
little tar geodes, if you will. You start feeling

1177
00:53:14,223 --> 00:53:20,903
around and finding these large roots that are just
a heavy network of chaos beneath the tree.

1178
00:53:20,903 --> 00:53:27,111
You're now under the tree, probably a good 25,
30 feet below it.

1179
00:53:27,111 --> 00:53:31,292
MARISHA: Okay. If I reach and out touch one of the
roots,

1180
00:53:31,292 --> 00:53:33,953
like just run my hand along it, what happens?

1181
00:53:33,953 --> 00:53:35,328
SAM: God, what is she doing?

1182
00:53:35,328 --> 00:53:36,535
TALIESIN: You're my hero.

1183
00:53:36,535 --> 00:53:40,914
MATT: You run your hand along the root. It's
stiff, the surface of the bark itself is a little

1184
00:53:40,914 --> 00:53:49,774
rough at the touch. Yeah.

1185
00:53:49,774 --> 00:53:51,674
TALIESIN: Sorry. I just love that word.

1186
00:53:51,674 --> 00:53:55,566
SAM: Dick joke.

1187
00:53:55,566 --> 00:54:02,700
MARISHA: I move back a little bit, kind of getting
away from the tree.

1188
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:09,722
MATT: Okay, glide backward, away from that large
root that you had run into.

1189
00:54:09,722 --> 00:54:14,988
MARISHA: Do I sense any type of creatures living
under here?

1190
00:54:14,988 --> 00:54:17,133
MATT: Not within your vicinity, no.

1191
00:54:17,133 --> 00:54:19,919
MARISHA: Any movement, nothing crazy?

1192
00:54:19,919 --> 00:54:24,688
MATT: Just the occasional shift, like a very faint
movement that's

1193
00:54:24,688 --> 00:54:29,970
rather sudden in certain areas nearby.

1194
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:32,497
MARISHA: Okay, I'm gonna start making my way back
to the mansion.

1195
00:54:32,497 --> 00:54:34,010
TALIESIN: It was good, it was good.

1196
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:38,485
MATT: You earthglide back up, you guys, after
waiting a few minutes, suddenly emerging from the

1197
00:54:38,485 --> 00:54:44,116
bottom of the bog, you see Keyleth's now covered
in black tar-like material,

1198
00:54:44,116 --> 00:54:46,102
her elemental form emerges.

1199
00:54:46,102 --> 00:54:47,827
MARISHA: Ooh, like the swamp thing? Do I look like
the swamp thing?

1200
00:54:47,827 --> 00:54:48,688
MATT: Kinda.

1201
00:54:48,688 --> 00:54:50,139
MARISHA: That's cool.

1202
00:54:50,139 --> 00:54:51,703
LAURA: Are you okay?

1203
00:54:51,703 --> 00:54:53,170
MARISHA: (rock noises)

1204
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:55,844
LAURA: Oh, right. Cool.

1205
00:54:55,844 --> 00:54:59,363
MATT: She talks. It sounds like a slow-moving
rockslide. (rock sounds)

1206
00:54:59,363 --> 00:55:00,942
LAURA: Awesome.

1207
00:55:00,942 --> 00:55:03,378
TALIESIN: Do you speak rock?

1208
00:55:03,378 --> 00:55:10,932
MARISHA: That's very poetic. And then I kind of
make my way up and drop earth elemental form.

1209
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:15,898
MATT: Okay, as you drop the form, much of the muck
just kind of drops off of where the form once was.

1210
00:55:15,898 --> 00:55:22,308
A little bit's still clinging to the bottom of
your robes, but mostly clean.

1211
00:55:22,308 --> 00:55:27,993
MARISHA: Yeah, I think it's good, I didn't really
see much or learn much more than we already knew.

1212
00:55:27,993 --> 00:55:29,928
LAURA: Did you see any creatures around?

1213
00:55:29,928 --> 00:55:30,843
MARISHA: No creatures.

1214
00:55:30,843 --> 00:55:32,516
SAM: Did the muck try to eat you?

1215
00:55:32,516 --> 00:55:35,172
MARISHA: The muck did not try to eat me.
It's not as deep as I would've thought, actually.

1216
00:55:35,172 --> 00:55:43,157
It's only three feet or so deep. I do believe
that the tree is living, though. I think its roots

1217
00:55:43,157 --> 00:55:46,775
were kind of twitching and moving around.

1218
00:55:46,775 --> 00:55:49,683
SAM: But you felt the roots, it's not an illusion,
it's a real tree.

1219
00:55:49,683 --> 00:55:51,364
MARISHA: It is a real tree.

1220
00:55:51,364 --> 00:55:52,496
SAM: Okay.

1221
00:55:52,496 --> 00:55:54,867
MARISHA: The roots were very turgid.

1222
00:55:54,867 --> 00:55:57,026
SAM: Hmm. What a good word.

1223
00:55:57,026 --> 00:55:59,536
MARISHA: Someone taught that to me earlier.

1224
00:55:59,536 --> 00:56:05,675
TALIESIN: I feel like a terrible person, I think.
It's just a great word, that's all.

1225
00:56:05,675 --> 00:56:07,951
MATT: All right. So with her return, what are you
guys gonna do?

1226
00:56:07,951 --> 00:56:09,822
TRAVIS: (punching sounds)

1227
00:56:09,822 --> 00:56:11,933
LAURA: Do you wanna go, maybe?

1228
00:56:11,933 --> 00:56:15,253
SAM: Yeah, I guess we should go in and see what
going on, what's cooking in the kitchen.

1229
00:56:15,253 --> 00:56:16,177
LAURA: Okay.

1230
00:56:16,177 --> 00:56:19,599
MATT: As you guys rush into the kitchen,
and looking around, you can see now every

1231
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:24,404
cabinet's pulled off of its hinges and shattered
in half, what was a central stone island is now

1232
00:56:24,404 --> 00:56:26,892
just a pile of smashed granite.

1233
00:56:26,892 --> 00:56:28,103
SAM: Damn it.

1234
00:56:28,103 --> 00:56:33,699
MATT: Every single possible breakable utensil,
platter--

1235
00:56:33,699 --> 00:56:35,554
TRAVIS: Don't forget the holes in the wall.

1236
00:56:35,554 --> 00:56:40,831
MATT: Oh, it is just ruin. You see every servant
is now on the ground trying to scoop things up,

1237
00:56:40,831 --> 00:56:43,011
and as soon as they get a handful to go ahead and
set it somewhere,

1238
00:56:43,011 --> 00:56:47,685
just slapped out of their hand by a fist.

1239
00:56:47,685 --> 00:56:50,909
SAM: Grog, what are you doing? This is our kitchen
and we need to eat dinner here!

1240
00:56:50,909 --> 00:56:57,455
TRAVIS: I'm trying to activate these, and they
require pain. (yells)

1241
00:56:57,455 --> 00:57:02,970
MATT: With that, what was once a large black
cauldron that was used in soup and other sort of

1242
00:57:02,970 --> 00:57:09,608
base-like liquids, is now, pwang, a large heavy
ding is now on the inside in the shape of a fist,

1243
00:57:09,608 --> 00:57:11,080
and it's half as useful.

1244
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:11,984
LAURA: Grog!

1245
00:57:11,984 --> 00:57:14,158
TRAVIS: Do I notice any difference in the
gauntlets?

1246
00:57:14,158 --> 00:57:17,778
MATT: Make a perception check.

1247
00:57:17,778 --> 00:57:19,361
TRAVIS: At disadvantage?

1248
00:57:19,361 --> 00:57:20,383
LAURA: Because you're super tired.

1249
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:22,300
MATT: Yes, because you haven't rested yet.

1250
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:24,904
TRAVIS: One less. Ten.

1251
00:57:24,904 --> 00:57:27,895
MATT: No difference whatsoever.

1252
00:57:27,895 --> 00:57:32,060
TRAVIS: Maybe I need to hit people.

1253
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:33,772
LIAM: I start backing away slow.

1254
00:57:33,772 --> 00:57:35,424
(All laugh.)

1255
00:57:35,424 --> 00:57:38,512
TALIESIN: I walk in at this point and I'm just
looking for some chicken.

1256
00:57:38,512 --> 00:57:41,363
MARISHA: I also walk in. Scanlan!

1257
00:57:41,363 --> 00:57:43,327
LAURA: Oh, you're not an earth elemental anymore.

1258
00:57:43,327 --> 00:57:44,552
MARISHA: Are you remodeling?

1259
00:57:44,552 --> 00:57:45,431
LAURA: That's too bad.

1260
00:57:45,431 --> 00:57:50,850
SAM: I didn't intend to, but Grog has forgotten
that I have a whole training ground downstairs

1261
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:57,059
that he could've used. Grog, if you need to hit
something, someone,

1262
00:57:57,059 --> 00:58:00,902
I can give you a few of the servants.

1263
00:58:00,902 --> 00:58:02,130
TRAVIS: Would you?

1264
00:58:02,130 --> 00:58:04,253
SAM: Sure, I've got like a hundred of them.

1265
00:58:04,253 --> 00:58:05,115
TRAVIS: How many?

1266
00:58:05,115 --> 00:58:06,196
SAM: You guys don't mind, do you?

1267
00:58:06,196 --> 00:58:07,839
LAURA: Wait, do they feel pain?

1268
00:58:07,839 --> 00:58:11,178
MATT: They all turn to you and kinda go.

1269
00:58:11,178 --> 00:58:12,810
TRAVIS: How many can I have?

1270
00:58:12,810 --> 00:58:14,903
SAM: Have a dozen. Baker's dozen.

1271
00:58:14,903 --> 00:58:16,538
TRAVIS: I go into the next room.

1272
00:58:16,538 --> 00:58:17,869
TALIESIN: A dozen bakers.

1273
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:19,105
TRAVIS: With the dozen servants.

1274
00:58:19,105 --> 00:58:21,501
LAURA: Go downstairs, Grog!

1275
00:58:21,501 --> 00:58:23,908
TRAVIS: What if a change happens, don't you wanna
be there?

1276
00:58:23,908 --> 00:58:25,569
LAURA: All right, yeah.

1277
00:58:25,569 --> 00:58:29,724
LIAM: Scanlan, does your house unbreak itself if
Grog breaks it, you know, if it goes away,

1278
00:58:29,724 --> 00:58:33,392
it poofs and it comes back, is all his damage
there or does it--

1279
00:58:33,392 --> 00:58:37,147
TRAVIS: Please. Grog always leaves his mark.

1280
00:58:37,147 --> 00:58:43,434
SAM: The damage, I believe, I've never seen damage
this bad in our place before, but. I believe it

1281
00:58:43,434 --> 00:58:46,508
will reset. It goes back to normal at the end.

1282
00:58:46,508 --> 00:58:48,609
MATT: We'll find out.

1283
00:58:48,609 --> 00:58:50,579
LAURA: We haven't looked at the spa since we
destroyed it.

1284
00:58:50,579 --> 00:58:52,416
SAM: I haven't been down to the spa in a while.

1285
00:58:52,416 --> 00:58:55,761
TRAVIS: I pick up one of the servants by the head
and I try and crush his head.

1286
00:58:55,761 --> 00:58:57,291
LAURA: Oh, no!

1287
00:58:57,291 --> 00:58:59,854
MATT: Your fingers pass through its spectral form.
There's no actual--

1288
00:58:59,854 --> 00:59:03,117
TRAVIS: Make yourself grabbable.

1289
00:59:03,117 --> 00:59:04,434
SAM: You have to try harder, Grog.

1290
00:59:04,434 --> 00:59:06,106
MATT: Passes through again.

1291
00:59:06,106 --> 00:59:13,459
TRAVIS: Fix this. You fix this now. I will break
more stuff.

1292
00:59:13,459 --> 00:59:15,700
SAM: I thought that would work, honestly.

1293
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:17,038
TALIESIN: Is Keyleth still covered in goop?

1294
00:59:17,038 --> 00:59:18,011
TRAVIS: I punched the cow before.

1295
00:59:18,011 --> 00:59:19,324
LAURA: You did punch a cow.

1296
00:59:19,324 --> 00:59:20,360
MARISHA: I kinda fwooshed it off.

1297
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,383
TALIESIN: Do you have any left on you?

1298
00:59:21,383 --> 00:59:24,268
LIAM: Grog, he doesn't want you to know this,
he told me this the last time you were here,

1299
00:59:24,268 --> 00:59:29,402
you actually have to do that 33 times before it
takes hold, so just keep going.

1300
00:59:29,402 --> 00:59:33,663
TRAVIS: I grab again. I grab again. I grab again.
I grab again.

1301
00:59:33,663 --> 00:59:40,509
MATT: As you keep going, you're not even sure
quite what a 33 is, but you just keep going.

1302
00:59:40,509 --> 00:59:47,795
The servant stands there, its kind of loosely
formless face, other than you can see eyes,

1303
00:59:47,795 --> 00:59:51,842
a nose, and a mouth, but the features are very
plain and translucent,

1304
00:59:51,842 --> 00:59:55,867
just stay wide and staring straight at you.

1305
00:59:55,867 --> 00:59:58,477
TRAVIS: Fine, fine. Bring me a cow.

1306
00:59:58,477 --> 01:00:01,075
LAURA: Ohh.

1307
01:00:01,142 --> 01:00:03,329
SAM: We usually have one cow.

1308
01:00:03,329 --> 01:00:05,933
MATT: The servants vanish and come back,
you hear a familiar (dinging).

1309
01:00:05,933 --> 01:00:08,391
LAURA: No, I hated it when you punched the cow!

1310
01:00:08,391 --> 01:00:09,679
TRAVIS: No, no, no.

1311
01:00:09,679 --> 01:00:11,304
TALIESIN: I'm going back to my room.

1312
01:00:11,304 --> 01:00:13,518
TRAVIS: It's time to ring this bell.

1313
01:00:13,518 --> 01:00:14,655
LAURA: No.

1314
01:00:14,655 --> 01:00:15,946
TRAVIS: I beat the shit out of the cow.

1315
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:17,710
(All groan.)

1316
01:00:17,710 --> 01:00:20,690
LAURA: That is awful. I leave, I can't watch,
I go and look for chicken.

1317
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:24,957
SAM: Before you beat this poor senseless cow--

1318
01:00:24,957 --> 01:00:27,113
TRAVIS: It's a purple, like, ethereal cow.

1319
01:00:27,113 --> 01:00:28,648
MATT: Yeah.

1320
01:00:28,648 --> 01:00:30,624
LAURA: It's still a cow, it's still a cow, don't.

1321
01:00:30,624 --> 01:00:36,047
TRAVIS: I'm gonna rocky ribs the shit out of this
cow.

1322
01:00:36,047 --> 01:00:39,373
LIAM: Street Fighter it?

1323
01:00:39,373 --> 01:00:46,028
MATT: Bonus round. You take the next half an hour,
beating the non-living crap out of this spectral

1324
01:00:46,028 --> 01:00:52,303
cow, which, every impact has a sound hit.
Does not seem to react in pain as much as

1325
01:00:52,303 --> 01:00:58,320
(distressed mooing). There's no physical damage
seen upon its form, it just gets knocked around.

1326
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:58,941
LAURA: That's good.

1327
01:00:58,941 --> 01:01:03,910
SAM: I've got an idea. I can fix this, Grog,
I want you to be a satisfied customer. Let's go

1328
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:05,239
downstairs.

1329
01:01:05,239 --> 01:01:06,101
TRAVIS: Okay.

1330
01:01:06,101 --> 01:01:07,356
SAM: Okay. I take him downstairs.

1331
01:01:07,356 --> 01:01:08,380
MATT: All right.

1332
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:15,367
SAM: I say, you're gonna punch me and keep
punching me as long as you can. All right?

1333
01:01:15,367 --> 01:01:16,420
TRAVIS: Are you sure?

1334
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:20,299
SAM: And I transform into a triceratops.

1335
01:01:20,299 --> 01:01:23,231
LAURA: Awesome.

1336
01:01:23,231 --> 01:01:25,825
MARISHA: I go downstairs to watch.

1337
01:01:25,825 --> 01:01:28,806
TRAVIS: Is this my day-birth or something?

1338
01:01:28,806 --> 01:01:31,702
SAM: Birthday. I mean, (growls)

1339
01:01:31,702 --> 01:01:35,941
MATT: Yes, as you hear the growling creature
you've never seen before in your life, horns

1340
01:01:35,941 --> 01:01:41,626
protruding from the front of its bony, armored
headpiece, its scaled armored body standing before

1341
01:01:41,626 --> 01:01:48,363
you, massive, snorting, you just start punching
the crap out of it.

1342
01:01:48,363 --> 01:01:50,349
TRAVIS: Yeah. Rage-punching.

1343
01:01:50,349 --> 01:01:54,298
(All singing Jurassic Park theme.)

1344
01:01:54,298 --> 01:01:56,032
SAM: I'm gonna fight back a little.

1345
01:01:56,032 --> 01:02:00,940
MATT: A little bit? All right. You guys do begin
to scrap back and forth for the next ten minutes.

1346
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:04,652
'Cause it takes ten minutes of solid punching and
missing for Grog to eventually whittle your

1347
01:02:04,652 --> 01:02:12,069
triceratops hitpoints down to zero. However,
in the process, you do manage to get a bit gored,

1348
01:02:12,069 --> 01:02:16,156
suffering a total of nine points of piercing
damage throughout the entirety of this, just

1349
01:02:16,156 --> 01:02:21,691
little scrapes and scratches, the occasional
puncture wound, but eventually you get one solid

1350
01:02:21,691 --> 01:02:27,369
crack with the gauntlets across his face,
and the triceratops form shifts back down to a

1351
01:02:27,369 --> 01:02:30,609
tiny little Scanlan Shorthalt.

1352
01:02:30,609 --> 01:02:32,684
LAURA: Don't hit him, don't hit him!

1353
01:02:32,684 --> 01:02:40,614
SAM: Wait, wait, did it work? Are your gauntlets
better or whatever you're trying to do?

1354
01:02:40,614 --> 01:02:42,002
TRAVIS: Do I feel anything?

1355
01:02:42,002 --> 01:02:43,119
MATT: Perception check.

1356
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:47,140
LAURA: You need to rest so you can perceive things
better. Oh.

1357
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:50,809
TALIESIN: Can you roll lower?

1358
01:02:50,809 --> 01:02:52,973
TRAVIS: I could. There's one number lower.

1359
01:02:52,973 --> 01:02:56,533
(All laugh.)

1360
01:02:56,533 --> 01:03:01,072
MATT: No seeming change whatsoever. Although no
scarring. The good thing about the gauntlets is

1361
01:03:01,072 --> 01:03:02,895
that they're powerful enough where all those
impacts

1362
01:03:02,895 --> 01:03:05,886
don't appear to have scratched or dented
the surface.

1363
01:03:05,886 --> 01:03:07,669
TRAVIS: No.

1364
01:03:07,669 --> 01:03:09,023
SAM: Am I okay?

1365
01:03:09,023 --> 01:03:13,755
MATT: You're a little sore. That last hit did
carry over a little bit, the form didn't absorb

1366
01:03:13,755 --> 01:03:20,291
the entirety of the blow. You did come back with,
uh. Four points of bludgeoning damage to your

1367
01:03:20,291 --> 01:03:25,872
chin, so you're, you know, a little bit of blood
on the corner of your lip that you can taste,

1368
01:03:25,872 --> 01:03:29,252
and your jaw is a little sore on the right side.

1369
01:03:29,252 --> 01:03:34,032
TALIESIN: Just for fun while everything's going
on, I'm running two passive experiments in my lab

1370
01:03:34,032 --> 01:03:35,613
while I'm working on the shoes.

1371
01:03:35,613 --> 01:03:36,332
MATT: Sure.

1372
01:03:36,332 --> 01:03:39,631
MARISHA: Oh, and I help him finish the shoes by
helping druidcraft them.

1373
01:03:39,631 --> 01:03:43,112
TALIESIN: I'm leaving some of the muck on some
chicken that I took from the kitchen to see if it

1374
01:03:43,112 --> 01:03:46,311
has any effect on flesh after a long exposure.

1375
01:03:46,311 --> 01:03:47,389
MATT: Okay.

1376
01:03:47,389 --> 01:03:49,863
TALIESIN: And then I'm distilling some to see if I
can even

1377
01:03:49,863 --> 01:03:52,363
identify anything in there or anything weird.

1378
01:03:52,363 --> 01:03:55,604
MATT: All right. So what are you guys doing now?

1379
01:03:55,604 --> 01:03:58,685
TRAVIS: Being disappointed.

1380
01:03:58,685 --> 01:04:01,767
TALIESIN: Do you have to roll for that?

1381
01:04:01,767 --> 01:04:02,192
MATT: Disadvantage.

1382
01:04:02,192 --> 01:04:03,198
LAURA: Natural 20.

1383
01:04:03,198 --> 01:04:07,335
(All laugh.)

1384
01:04:07,335 --> 01:04:08,994
LAURA: I was saying it, but it really happened!

1385
01:04:08,994 --> 01:04:10,825
TALIESIN: Metaphor! Metaphor!

1386
01:04:10,825 --> 01:04:21,597
SAM: You know what, Grog, you could, it might make
you feel better if you repaid the favor.

1387
01:04:21,597 --> 01:04:25,669
I've been meaning to try to upgrade Mythcarver.

1388
01:04:25,669 --> 01:04:28,230
TRAVIS: Yeah, come get it. Come get it.

1389
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:35,452
SAM: All right, I'm gonna do a stab. I'm gonna
sing a note and see if this does anything to

1390
01:04:35,452 --> 01:04:41,233
Mythcarver. I'll just go (sings a note) and I'll
try and jam it through his arm.

1391
01:04:41,233 --> 01:04:45,304
MATT: Okay, you hit up a scale of notes,
and one note resonates with the blade, and the

1392
01:04:45,304 --> 01:04:50,078
harmonic resonance kind of causes it to shake ever
so slightly as it kind of amplifies the sound.

1393
01:04:50,078 --> 01:04:51,383
Go ahead and roll an attack.

1394
01:04:51,383 --> 01:04:52,452
LAURA: Oh my god.

1395
01:04:52,452 --> 01:04:54,618
SAM: 18 plus nine.

1396
01:04:54,618 --> 01:04:57,577
MATT: That definitely hits. Go ahead and roll
damage.

1397
01:04:57,577 --> 01:05:07,116
SAM: Uh, not much. 1d8. Three, six, plus one... 
ooh, nine!

1398
01:05:07,116 --> 01:05:11,887
MATT: Nine points of damage to you, Grog,
as the blade kinda sinks about four inches

1399
01:05:11,887 --> 01:05:13,237
through one of your pectoral muscles.

1400
01:05:13,237 --> 01:05:15,739
TRAVIS: (grunts)

1401
01:05:15,739 --> 01:05:19,880
SAM: And I will sing as I withdraw it as well.
(sings a note)

1402
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:25,098
MATT: You pull it out and the blade almost
vibrates as it does, it scatters the blood off of

1403
01:05:25,098 --> 01:05:27,140
its surface as you withdraw it from the wound.

1404
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:31,065
SAM: Do I notice any change in the weapon?

1405
01:05:31,065 --> 01:05:32,218
MATT: It is bloodless.

1406
01:05:32,218 --> 01:05:33,316
SAM: Damn it.

1407
01:05:33,316 --> 01:05:34,533
MATT: No noticeable change.

1408
01:05:34,533 --> 01:05:35,392
TRAVIS: Nothing?

1409
01:05:35,392 --> 01:05:36,182
MATT: Nothing.

1410
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:38,053
TRAVIS: You're only gonna do it once?

1411
01:05:38,053 --> 01:05:39,446
SAM: But it hurts you!

1412
01:05:39,446 --> 01:05:43,071
TRAVIS: Nah. Do one more, but like, angry-sing.

1413
01:05:43,071 --> 01:05:49,380
SAM: All right. All right, one more time.
I'll do some like Black Sabbathy sort of

1414
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:53,636
(heavy metal screaming).

1415
01:05:53,636 --> 01:05:55,570
MATT: (laughs) Go for it.

1416
01:05:55,570 --> 01:05:56,552
SAM: All right.

1417
01:05:56,552 --> 01:06:00,571
MATT: Take advantage on this one because of your
intense singing.

1418
01:06:00,571 --> 01:06:01,886
SAM: 18 plus nine.

1419
01:06:01,886 --> 01:06:03,705
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll damage.

1420
01:06:03,705 --> 01:06:05,872
LAURA: Oh my god.

1421
01:06:05,872 --> 01:06:08,367
SAM: Ooh, yeah, that's better.

1422
01:06:08,367 --> 01:06:09,725
SAM and TALIESIN: Ooh!

1423
01:06:09,725 --> 01:06:11,421
SAM: 15.

1424
01:06:11,421 --> 01:06:12,834
MATT: Shnk! Other pectoral muscle now.

1425
01:06:12,834 --> 01:06:14,016
TRAVIS: (yelps)

1426
01:06:14,016 --> 01:06:17,589
MATT: A matching wound, this one kind of, (yelps),
tickles you a little as it goes a little deeper

1427
01:06:17,589 --> 01:06:22,213
and kinda tickles the outside of a lung.

1428
01:06:22,213 --> 01:06:26,861
SAM: All right. I withdraw. And any change?

1429
01:06:26,861 --> 01:06:31,934
MATT: As you withdraw, it kind of rings with the
pullback, blood scattered, blade is clean,

1430
01:06:31,934 --> 01:06:33,091
no noticeable change.

1431
01:06:33,091 --> 01:06:34,446
SAM: Ah, damn it. All right, forget it.

1432
01:06:34,446 --> 01:06:35,801
TRAVIS: These things don't work.

1433
01:06:35,801 --> 01:06:36,858
SAM: I know, these suck.

1434
01:06:36,858 --> 01:06:39,962
TRAVIS: What are we doing wrong?

1435
01:06:39,962 --> 01:06:43,628
SAM: I don't know. Wish there was a manual.

1436
01:06:43,628 --> 01:06:50,023
TRAVIS: Have we looked for instructions? Is there
writing on the Titanstone Knuckles?

1437
01:06:50,023 --> 01:06:52,445
MATT: There are various carvings on it.

1438
01:06:52,445 --> 01:06:54,703
TRAVIS: Carvings.

1439
01:06:54,703 --> 01:06:56,692
SAM: Anything on mine?

1440
01:06:56,692 --> 01:07:00,878
MATT: There are runes around the base of it.
What languages do you know?

1441
01:07:00,878 --> 01:07:04,200
SAM: Nothing. I know Common and Gnome.

1442
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:05,868
MATT: Yeah, you don't recognize it.

1443
01:07:05,868 --> 01:07:11,390
LAURA: I'm gonna go up to Grog and cast Cure
Wounds at third level.

1444
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:17,020
MATT: Okay, go for it, you can roll that up.

1445
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:18,989
LAURA: Ten whole points of healing.

1446
01:07:18,989 --> 01:07:20,546
TRAVIS: Thanks, man.

1447
01:07:20,546 --> 01:07:22,102
MARISHA: I also go ahead and cure myself up.

1448
01:07:22,102 --> 01:07:23,393
MATT: Okay. All right.

1449
01:07:23,393 --> 01:07:24,663
SAM: We're about to take a rest.

1450
01:07:24,663 --> 01:07:25,506
MARISHA: Eh.

1451
01:07:25,506 --> 01:07:26,556
MATT: What else do you guys want to do?

1452
01:07:26,556 --> 01:07:27,748
TRAVIS: I'm gonna long rest now.

1453
01:07:27,748 --> 01:07:29,278
TALIESIN: Long rest, eat some chicken.

1454
01:07:29,278 --> 01:07:32,081
MARISHA: Wait, do we have any vague plan, wait,
we plan at dawn?

1455
01:07:32,081 --> 01:07:34,300
LAURA: We'll plan tomorrow morning.

1456
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:35,576
MARISHA: We'll plan at dawn.

1457
01:07:35,576 --> 01:07:36,375
TRAVIS: We'll plan at dawn.

1458
01:07:36,375 --> 01:07:40,175
LAURA: I wanna go upstairs and just open the door
and keep an eye out of it for just a little bit

1459
01:07:40,175 --> 01:07:42,413
and see what I see out the doorway.

1460
01:07:42,413 --> 01:07:47,944
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check.

1461
01:07:47,944 --> 01:07:56,860
LAURA: Oh, come on! Oh, um. That would be a 15.

1462
01:07:56,860 --> 01:08:00,748
MATT: 15. All right. How much time do you spend
out there?

1463
01:08:00,748 --> 01:08:02,108
LAURA: Well, at the door?

1464
01:08:02,108 --> 01:08:02,811
MATT: Yeah.

1465
01:08:02,811 --> 01:08:06,864
LAURA: How much time can I spend and still get a
good rest?

1466
01:08:06,864 --> 01:08:11,534
MATT: Well, I mean, you need an eight-hour rest
for a full night's rest, so it depends how much

1467
01:08:11,534 --> 01:08:13,647
time you want to push off until you begin taking
your rest.

1468
01:08:13,647 --> 01:08:15,948
LAURA: Oh, right. Well, how about a couple hours?

1469
01:08:15,948 --> 01:08:19,643
MATT: Okay. First hour, seemingly no real change.
Second hour,

1470
01:08:19,643 --> 01:08:25,722
go ahead and make another perception check.

1471
01:08:25,722 --> 01:08:27,830
LAURA: 17.

1472
01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:37,924
MATT: 17. You do notice a little ways off,
some of the tree brush shifts a little bit,

1473
01:08:37,924 --> 01:08:41,420
and then you see what looks to be a few trees
kind of (fwoosh).

1474
01:08:41,420 --> 01:08:42,563
LAURA: Disappear?

1475
01:08:42,563 --> 01:08:48,081
MATT: Seemingly there's now a hole in the canopy
where once was straight canopy.

1476
01:08:48,081 --> 01:08:50,081
TRAVIS: What do you think that is?

1477
01:08:50,081 --> 01:08:51,527
LAURA: I dunno.

1478
01:08:51,527 --> 01:08:53,223
TRAVIS: Like a giant werewolf maybe?

1479
01:08:53,223 --> 01:08:56,408
LAURA: A giant werewolf eating an entire tree?

1480
01:08:56,408 --> 01:08:59,261
TRAVIS: Tree's not missing.

1481
01:08:59,261 --> 01:09:01,376
LAURA: The tree, like, disappeared?

1482
01:09:01,376 --> 01:09:06,146
MATT: There is now a hole in the canopy where
there was not previously, seemingly the treetops

1483
01:09:06,146 --> 01:09:08,376
that filled that space have kind of moved out of
the way.

1484
01:09:08,376 --> 01:09:10,230
MARISHA: They go straight down?

1485
01:09:10,230 --> 01:09:17,276
LAURA: Oh, I bet something was sitting in the tree
maybe and was keeping still. That could be it.

1486
01:09:17,276 --> 01:09:22,631
Can I look down underneath us and see if the
trees are kind of staying put where we are?

1487
01:09:22,631 --> 01:09:26,163
MATT: Yeah, and glancing about, nothing is really
moving in your vicinity, and the area, the part of

1488
01:09:26,163 --> 01:09:29,023
the canopy that is now missing, is a pretty large
area.

1489
01:09:29,023 --> 01:09:31,500
LAURA: It seems bigger than a creature would be.

1490
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:36,373
MATT: It would probably have been the sudden
removal or shift of multiple trees to leave that

1491
01:09:36,373 --> 01:09:38,932
opening in the canopy.

1492
01:09:38,932 --> 01:09:40,451
TALIESIN: All right.

1493
01:09:40,451 --> 01:09:41,727
LAURA: Holy moly.

1494
01:09:41,727 --> 01:09:42,646
TALIESIN: All right.

1495
01:09:42,646 --> 01:09:46,539
MARISHA: Maybe something has trees on its back and
moves.

1496
01:09:46,539 --> 01:09:52,753
LAURA: Wow, maybe the hag can just move her hut
magically whenever she wants.

1497
01:09:52,753 --> 01:09:56,036
Do you think that's possible?

1498
01:09:56,036 --> 01:09:58,072
MARISHA: I don't know, maybe.

1499
01:09:58,072 --> 01:10:00,575
LAURA: But the big scary tree, that's staying
still.

1500
01:10:00,575 --> 01:10:01,184
MATT: Yeah.

1501
01:10:01,184 --> 01:10:02,634
MARISHA: Was it coming from that direction?

1502
01:10:02,634 --> 01:10:03,881
MATT: Yeah, it's still in its place.

1503
01:10:03,881 --> 01:10:05,359
LAURA: What direction was it coming from?

1504
01:10:05,359 --> 01:10:07,566
MATT: Actually, it would be kind of southwest from
where you are now.

1505
01:10:07,566 --> 01:10:09,551
MARISHA: So the direction we came from.

1506
01:10:09,551 --> 01:10:14,281
MATT: No, you came southeast, not the direction
where you came from, it's still maybe a

1507
01:10:14,281 --> 01:10:20,505
quarter-mile to a half-mile from where you
currently are, so it's not on your path per se.

1508
01:10:20,505 --> 01:10:22,128
TRAVIS: Can I roll some hit dice to heal up?

1509
01:10:22,128 --> 01:10:23,042
LAURA: All right. Shit.

1510
01:10:23,042 --> 01:10:24,778
MATT: Well, for a full night's rest you're fully
healed.

1511
01:10:24,778 --> 01:10:27,396
LAURA: I guess I shut the door. That's creepy.

1512
01:10:27,396 --> 01:10:29,457
MATT: All right. You close the door.

1513
01:10:29,457 --> 01:10:33,044
LAURA: I don't know who I would talk to about
that. Can I go find Keyleth, are you asleep yet?

1514
01:10:33,044 --> 01:10:36,010
MARISHA: No. I don't think so. I've been helping
Percy with his shoes.

1515
01:10:36,010 --> 01:10:38,131
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're in my room. Making shoes.

1516
01:10:38,131 --> 01:10:39,907
MATT: Okay. Shoes are finished now.

1517
01:10:39,907 --> 01:10:41,464
LAURA: Oh. Okay. So you guys are together?

1518
01:10:41,464 --> 01:10:43,121
MARISHA: Just finished making shoes.

1519
01:10:43,121 --> 01:10:45,014
LAURA: Oh, look at those beautiful shoes.
They're lovely.

1520
01:10:45,014 --> 01:10:46,580
MARISHA: Yeah, they might work.

1521
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:47,941
TALIESIN: They're not, but thank you.

1522
01:10:47,941 --> 01:10:49,877
MATT: They're pretty rough. They're pretty rough.

1523
01:10:49,877 --> 01:10:50,977
LAURA: No, no, those look great.

1524
01:10:50,977 --> 01:10:51,776
MARISHA: Thank you.

1525
01:10:51,776 --> 01:10:53,163
TALIESIN: Rustic. Very rustic.

1526
01:10:53,163 --> 01:10:54,889
MARISHA: Thank you. I'm proud of them, Percy.

1527
01:10:54,889 --> 01:10:55,893
TALIESIN: I'm proud too.

1528
01:10:55,893 --> 01:10:57,966
TRAVIS: Your shoes suck.

1529
01:10:57,966 --> 01:11:00,555
TALIESIN: You're not here.

1530
01:11:00,555 --> 01:11:04,106
MATT: He did pop in briefly to just tell you
that.

1531
01:11:04,106 --> 01:11:05,809
LAURA: (Grog voice) Those shoes suck.

1532
01:11:05,809 --> 01:11:07,961
MATT: And closes the door.

1533
01:11:07,961 --> 01:11:11,122
SAM: He did that to everybody's room, just in
case.

1534
01:11:11,122 --> 01:11:14,162
MATT: To cover all his bases.

1535
01:11:14,162 --> 01:11:15,662
SAM: Hey!

1536
01:11:15,662 --> 01:11:16,975
MATT: Perfect.

1537
01:11:16,975 --> 01:11:18,293
LAURA: Can I sit down?

1538
01:11:18,293 --> 01:11:20,728
MARISHA: You were supposed to be a bootmaker.
You're super-judgey.

1539
01:11:20,728 --> 01:11:21,883
LAURA: Oh, this is true.

1540
01:11:21,883 --> 01:11:22,976
TALIESIN: You were a bootmaker, that's very true.

1541
01:11:22,976 --> 01:11:23,871
MATT: You did start making your own boots, yeah.

1542
01:11:23,871 --> 01:11:24,909
LAURA: That was your very first--

1543
01:11:24,909 --> 01:11:27,203
TRAVIS: You didn't ask me to make the boots.

1544
01:11:27,203 --> 01:11:31,787
LAURA: Can I sit down and start playing with the
shoes? And, um, ask, Keyleth? Do you know of

1545
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:35,504
anything that would cause entire trees to vanish?

1546
01:11:35,504 --> 01:11:37,235
MARISHA: How do you mean, vanish?

1547
01:11:37,235 --> 01:11:41,802
LAURA: Well, I was staring at the door, and all of
a sudden, around a space,

1548
01:11:41,802 --> 01:11:44,580
about three trees just disappeared.

1549
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:47,707
MARISHA: Like something really large passed in
front of it?

1550
01:11:47,707 --> 01:11:50,503
LAURA: No, like they dropped, and there's a hole
in the canopy.

1551
01:11:50,503 --> 01:11:51,501
TALIESIN: Huh.

1552
01:11:51,501 --> 01:11:52,821
MARISHA: That's different.

1553
01:11:52,821 --> 01:11:53,638
TALIESIN: That's interesting.

1554
01:11:53,638 --> 01:11:55,206
LAURA: Do you know of anything that would cause
that?

1555
01:11:55,206 --> 01:11:56,173
TRAVIS: In the Feywild?

1556
01:11:56,173 --> 01:11:58,282
MARISHA: Do I know of anything that would cause
that? Can I roll a nature check or something?

1557
01:11:58,282 --> 01:12:00,762
MATT: Roll a nature check.

1558
01:12:00,762 --> 01:12:02,069
MARISHA: Don't fucking fail me.

1559
01:12:02,069 --> 01:12:04,081
LAURA: Would we have learned anything about that
in our studies?

1560
01:12:04,081 --> 01:12:05,558
MARISHA: (yells wordlessly)

1561
01:12:05,558 --> 01:12:07,221
SAM: Wow, those dice.

1562
01:12:07,221 --> 01:12:08,955
LAURA: Maybe just don't use them anymore.

1563
01:12:08,955 --> 01:12:10,373
TRAVIS: Don't know who you pissed off...

1564
01:12:10,373 --> 01:12:11,192
MARISHA: 14.

1565
01:12:11,192 --> 01:12:12,025
MATT: 14.

1566
01:12:12,025 --> 01:12:13,862
LAURA: They're so nice and-- maybe just put them
on display!

1567
01:12:13,862 --> 01:12:16,340
Maybe put them in a really pretty
glass case.

1568
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:21,641
MATT: No. Make 'em work for you. Make 'em work for
you. You paid for that shit.

1569
01:12:21,641 --> 01:12:23,485
LAURA: Turn 'em into jewelry?

1570
01:12:23,485 --> 01:12:30,368
MATT: I mean, there are a number of things that
could've done it, whether it be lumbering,

1571
01:12:30,368 --> 01:12:34,857
people chopping down trees takes them down.
Creatures that are large can push over trees.

1572
01:12:34,857 --> 01:12:38,965
Trees that are dying and rotting and eventually
fall over on their own.

1573
01:12:38,965 --> 01:12:42,196
LAURA: Did it look like they dropped down,
though? Or did it look like they dropped over?

1574
01:12:42,196 --> 01:12:45,401
MATT: It's hard to know from this perspective.
You just saw them kind of fall out of the canopy,

1575
01:12:45,401 --> 01:12:49,709
so you're not sure if it was at an angle or
straight down or what.

1576
01:12:49,709 --> 01:12:51,775
MARISHA: That could be so many things.

1577
01:12:51,775 --> 01:12:52,318
LAURA: Yeah.

1578
01:12:52,318 --> 01:12:55,112
MARISHA: It's hard to say.

1579
01:12:55,112 --> 01:12:59,825
TALIESIN: At this point, can I tell anything about
the muck from just boiling it to separate

1580
01:12:59,825 --> 01:13:04,787
components? Trying to just see what's in there.
I'm assuming it's probably just death-paste,

1581
01:13:04,787 --> 01:13:07,480
it's just rot.

1582
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:16,349
MATT: It looks to be just congealed decayed
matter. It does not have any properties that you

1583
01:13:16,349 --> 01:13:21,803
can tell on a chemical level at least that stand
out.

1584
01:13:21,803 --> 01:13:23,368
TALIESIN: But it is decayed matter.

1585
01:13:23,368 --> 01:13:27,070
MATT: It is various types of decayed matter,
organic matter.

1586
01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:29,569
TALIESIN: The tree is producing it.

1587
01:13:29,569 --> 01:13:31,353
LAURA: So it is like oil.

1588
01:13:31,353 --> 01:13:32,996
TALIESIN: Well, here's my question.

1589
01:13:32,996 --> 01:13:36,476
MARISHA: It's producing a lot of it, too.
Way more than it should.

1590
01:13:36,476 --> 01:13:38,364
TALIESIN: What do trees need to live?

1591
01:13:38,364 --> 01:13:39,313
TRAVIS: Grass.

1592
01:13:39,313 --> 01:13:40,558
SAM: Sunlight and water.

1593
01:13:40,558 --> 01:13:41,938
LAURA: Sunlight and water.

1594
01:13:41,938 --> 01:13:43,909
MARISHA: And a little bit of minerals and dirt.

1595
01:13:43,909 --> 01:13:47,093
TALIESIN: Where is the sunlight?

1596
01:13:47,093 --> 01:13:49,120
LAURA: Not here.

1597
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:51,230
TALIESIN: And the tree's alive.

1598
01:13:51,230 --> 01:13:53,871
MARISHA: Well, we're also in the Feywild.

1599
01:13:53,871 --> 01:13:55,961
LAURA: Might not need the same thing.

1600
01:13:55,961 --> 01:13:57,380
MARISHA: Might not need the same thing.

1601
01:13:57,380 --> 01:13:59,829
TALIESIN: Well, it's got to eat something.
This is what it's producing,

1602
01:13:59,829 --> 01:14:01,362
and it's got to eat something.

1603
01:14:01,362 --> 01:14:03,123
LAURA: Maybe it eats living creatures?

1604
01:14:03,123 --> 01:14:04,530
TALIESIN: Maybe it eats trees.

1605
01:14:04,530 --> 01:14:07,987
LIAM: So Percival, would you imagine that the
science of the Feywild, I don't know what that

1606
01:14:07,987 --> 01:14:15,673
phrase means, would it be the same as our own
world? Maybe it follows different rules.

1607
01:14:15,673 --> 01:14:22,512
TALIESIN: It probably does, but at the same time,
you don't get something from nothing. And...

1608
01:14:22,512 --> 01:14:25,601
life needs things to live.

1609
01:14:25,601 --> 01:14:27,490
SAM: That's so poetic.

1610
01:14:27,490 --> 01:14:31,617
TALIESIN: You don't get life from nothing.
A little iffy.

1611
01:14:31,617 --> 01:14:35,933
LAURA: And we did see those branches moving like
actual limbs on a being

1612
01:14:35,933 --> 01:14:38,595
as opposed to branches on a tree.

1613
01:14:38,595 --> 01:14:41,930
MARISHA: Well, I mean, nothing here has really
been natural.

1614
01:14:41,930 --> 01:14:43,607
LAURA: It could be like a venus flytrap.

1615
01:14:43,607 --> 01:14:50,389
TALIESIN: It's just a hypothesis, but what if the
tree's carnivorous. Or omnivorous.

1616
01:14:50,389 --> 01:14:53,509
LAURA: I think that's a very viable option.

1617
01:14:53,509 --> 01:14:58,606
MARISHA: So you think maybe it's the tree that ate
that other group of trees?

1618
01:14:58,606 --> 01:14:59,454
LAURA: Possibly.

1619
01:14:59,454 --> 01:15:00,967
TALIESIN: It's very big.

1620
01:15:00,967 --> 01:15:02,245
MARISHA: It's a cannibal tree?

1621
01:15:02,245 --> 01:15:03,648
TALIESIN: It might be a cannibal tree.

1622
01:15:03,648 --> 01:15:04,950
MARISHA: It's eating its own kind?

1623
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:09,453
TRAVIS: I mean, the sphinx did say that the bow is
the heart of a cancerous tree, I think if we're

1624
01:15:09,453 --> 01:15:12,578
expecting to not find the tree, we're stupid.

1625
01:15:12,578 --> 01:15:15,708
MARISHA: Does Fenthras mean anything? Fenthras
doesn't mean anything, right?

1626
01:15:15,708 --> 01:15:17,410
TRAVIS: I am the wrong one to ask.

1627
01:15:17,410 --> 01:15:19,128
LAURA: Fenthras, is that elven?

1628
01:15:19,128 --> 01:15:20,718
MATT: Fenthras is elven.

1629
01:15:20,718 --> 01:15:21,917
MARISHA: Is that a name?

1630
01:15:21,917 --> 01:15:27,323
MATT: There is no direct translation to it,
per se, but its name has hints or at least bases

1631
01:15:27,323 --> 01:15:35,784
of the ancient elven words for protector and
growth.

1632
01:15:35,784 --> 01:15:38,635
TALIESIN: Interesting.

1633
01:15:38,635 --> 01:15:40,113
MARISHA: Protector and growth.

1634
01:15:40,113 --> 01:15:42,201
TRAVIS: Why don't we poison the tree?

1635
01:15:42,201 --> 01:15:43,336
LAURA: I think it's already poisoned.

1636
01:15:43,336 --> 01:15:44,956
TALIESIN: How do you poison a poisoned tree?

1637
01:15:44,956 --> 01:15:46,093
LAURA: Give it sunlight.

1638
01:15:46,093 --> 01:15:49,836
TALIESIN: Sunlight is definitely something you
should put in your arsenal.

1639
01:15:49,836 --> 01:15:52,635
Whatever it's not used to being exposed to.

1640
01:15:52,635 --> 01:15:55,478
LAURA: Sunlight and water. Fresh water.

1641
01:15:55,478 --> 01:15:57,598
TALIESIN: I don't think rot is going to be how we
kill this thing.

1642
01:15:57,598 --> 01:16:00,126
I think it's not going to be like
the crocodile.

1643
01:16:00,126 --> 01:16:01,453
TRAVIS: Abba music.

1644
01:16:01,453 --> 01:16:02,525
LAURA: (laughs) Abba music.

1645
01:16:02,525 --> 01:16:03,461
MARISHA: No, it seems--

1646
01:16:03,461 --> 01:16:05,496
TALIESIN: It needs purification.

1647
01:16:05,496 --> 01:16:07,643
SAM: Don't worry, Pike can... oh.

1648
01:16:07,643 --> 01:16:09,458
TRAVIS: I also have poison.

1649
01:16:09,458 --> 01:16:10,432
SAM: Oh, okay.

1650
01:16:10,432 --> 01:16:12,577
TALIESIN: I think it might just laugh poison off.

1651
01:16:12,577 --> 01:16:14,092
TRAVIS: Oh.

1652
01:16:14,092 --> 01:16:15,463
TALIESIN: I don't know.

1653
01:16:15,463 --> 01:16:16,960
TRAVIS: What about honey?

1654
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:18,361
TALIESIN: Nothing laughs honey off.

1655
01:16:18,361 --> 01:16:20,080
LAURA: You have honey? Can you make honey in
your--

1656
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:21,289
TALIESIN: Can you make honey in that jar?

1657
01:16:21,289 --> 01:16:23,602
LIAM: Pull out the magic jug, yeah.

1658
01:16:23,602 --> 01:16:25,439
LAURA: You can make fresh water in that jug,
though, can't you?

1659
01:16:25,439 --> 01:16:26,855
TRAVIS: I got honey for you.

1660
01:16:26,855 --> 01:16:28,525
TALIESIN: You've got very little brain, don't
you?

1661
01:16:28,525 --> 01:16:29,575
MARISHA: Make some maple syrup?

1662
01:16:29,575 --> 01:16:30,965
SAM: How about holy water?

1663
01:16:30,965 --> 01:16:31,889
TRAVIS: No.

1664
01:16:31,889 --> 01:16:33,278
LAURA: Maybe? I don't know.

1665
01:16:33,278 --> 01:16:35,423
TRAVIS: I mean, I can make some water if you wanna
bless it.

1666
01:16:35,423 --> 01:16:36,183
SAM: No.

1667
01:16:36,183 --> 01:16:38,172
TALIESIN: That's not what we're hoping for.

1668
01:16:38,172 --> 01:16:41,979
MARISHA: I mean, when I was in my earth elemental
form, I got up underneath the tree, I mean,

1669
01:16:41,979 --> 01:16:47,034
I feel like if we needed to, I can get inside of
it.

1670
01:16:47,034 --> 01:16:48,742
TRAVIS: (laughs) By yourself?

1671
01:16:48,742 --> 01:16:52,089
LAURA: I think that could be a very scary
prospect.

1672
01:16:52,089 --> 01:16:57,061
TRAVIS: Let me tell you a tale of two people that
went inside a dragon.

1673
01:16:57,061 --> 01:16:58,666
LIAM: Worked out.

1674
01:16:58,666 --> 01:17:00,702
MARISHA: Yeah, they're still sitting here today.
It's fine.

1675
01:17:00,702 --> 01:17:04,023
TALIESIN: I was about to say, I don't think it's
much of a cautionary tale, really.

1676
01:17:04,023 --> 01:17:08,145
MARISHA: No. If anything, it's a terrible,
terrible influence.

1677
01:17:08,145 --> 01:17:15,493
TALIESIN: Yes. I think that's definitely,
I think light, I think electricity.

1678
01:17:15,493 --> 01:17:19,031
MARISHA: Well, it's not short on water, that's for
sure.

1679
01:17:19,031 --> 01:17:23,359
TALIESIN: There is water in the, was there
groundwater of some kind?

1680
01:17:23,359 --> 01:17:27,573
MARISHA: I mean, it was sludgy enough. Was there
groundwater?

1681
01:17:27,573 --> 01:17:31,925
MATT: I mean, there were pockets or some bit of
groundwater in there, but a lot of the dense

1682
01:17:31,925 --> 01:17:37,579
pockets you found were just deeply seated pockets
of that sludge-like material that seems to be

1683
01:17:37,579 --> 01:17:40,052
produced or put out by the nearby roots.

1684
01:17:40,052 --> 01:17:41,102
MARISHA: Right.

1685
01:17:41,102 --> 01:17:44,633
LAURA: When you talked to the trees around you,
did it seem like they were actually alive,

1686
01:17:44,633 --> 01:17:47,563
or was it all dead forest that we've been
traveling through?

1687
01:17:47,563 --> 01:17:49,006
MARISHA: When I communed with nature?

1688
01:17:49,006 --> 01:17:49,507
LAURA: Yeah.

1689
01:17:49,507 --> 01:17:53,669
MARISHA: Everything was alive everywhere.
That's what, the rules here haven't really--

1690
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:58,345
SAM: Have you been talking to any of the trees
around here? Right around here?

1691
01:17:58,345 --> 01:18:00,834
MARISHA: Yeah, I can. I can.

1692
01:18:00,834 --> 01:18:03,443
LAURA: Maybe before we sleep. Can you talk to the
nature?

1693
01:18:03,443 --> 01:18:06,054
MARISHA: I can.

1694
01:18:06,054 --> 01:18:07,732
TALIESIN: I'll watch this.

1695
01:18:07,732 --> 01:18:12,913
MARISHA: Do we have any questions that I might
want to figure out before I--

1696
01:18:12,913 --> 01:18:15,172
SAM: Is the big tree eating you all?

1697
01:18:15,172 --> 01:18:18,541
LAURA: Are you friends with the big tree? How can
we help?

1698
01:18:18,541 --> 01:18:20,049
TALIESIN: Can we cure you?

1699
01:18:20,049 --> 01:18:24,470
MARISHA: Cure the tree, is the tree eating other
things, can we cure the tree...

1700
01:18:24,470 --> 01:18:26,309
SAM: Is that a tree?

1701
01:18:26,309 --> 01:18:27,885
MARISHA: Is that even a tree?

1702
01:18:27,885 --> 01:18:29,698
LAURA: Oh, what if it's a big scary creature,
not actually a tree?

1703
01:18:29,698 --> 01:18:31,134
TRAVIS: Can we hurt the tree?

1704
01:18:31,134 --> 01:18:32,540
LIAM: Does the tree have a weakness?

1705
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:34,058
LAURA: Yeah.

1706
01:18:34,058 --> 01:18:37,819
MARISHA: I'll maybe try and figure out...
okay, all right. I'm gonna go step outside.

1707
01:18:37,819 --> 01:18:41,237
LAURA: Do you want to hang out on the broom so you
don't actually step--

1708
01:18:41,237 --> 01:18:42,712
TRAVIS: You're just giving the broom away now.

1709
01:18:42,712 --> 01:18:45,005
LAURA: Well, I just don't want anybody to actually
stand on a tree for very long.

1710
01:18:45,005 --> 01:18:46,530
TRAVIS: Just saying.

1711
01:18:46,530 --> 01:18:49,938
MARISHA: I have to be connected with the ground,
I think.

1712
01:18:49,938 --> 01:18:52,056
TALIESIN: Tie a rope around her this time.

1713
01:18:52,056 --> 01:18:53,201
LAURA: Right.

1714
01:18:53,201 --> 01:18:59,431
MARISHA: Okay, yeah, tie a rope around me.
And I jump back in the mud.

1715
01:18:59,431 --> 01:19:04,778
MATT: You land (splash), close to knee-deep in the
actual muck below you.

1716
01:19:04,778 --> 01:19:06,737
MARISHA: I'm gonna kind of lay back into it.

1717
01:19:06,737 --> 01:19:08,592
LAURA: Oh, jeez!

1718
01:19:08,592 --> 01:19:10,343
SAM: Ooh, like American Beauty?

1719
01:19:10,343 --> 01:19:12,135
MARISHA: Sensory deprivation tank-style.

1720
01:19:12,135 --> 01:19:14,209
LAURA: I just send things down onto her.

1721
01:19:14,209 --> 01:19:15,305
SAM: Chicken?

1722
01:19:15,305 --> 01:19:17,605
MATT: As you lay there, you slowly sink into it,
until you guys just see the outside of Keyleth's

1723
01:19:17,605 --> 01:19:22,051
face emerge, some of her horned crown sticking out
of the muck. A little bit of her chest and her

1724
01:19:22,051 --> 01:19:25,953
knees and some of the hands emerging, the rest of
her is submerged entirely in this muck.

1725
01:19:25,953 --> 01:19:27,356
TRAVIS: Sweet.

1726
01:19:27,356 --> 01:19:31,738
MATT: You close your eyes and begin reciting the
incantation of the spell. You begin to worry as

1727
01:19:31,738 --> 01:19:36,904
she begins to sink further in, but as she finishes
the incantation she stops sinking and it brings

1728
01:19:36,904 --> 01:19:41,503
her to the surface halfway and keeps her at this
balance point there.

1729
01:19:41,503 --> 01:19:43,970
LAURA: We're just staring out the door down at
her.

1730
01:19:43,970 --> 01:19:45,487
TALIESIN: Holding a rope.

1731
01:19:45,487 --> 01:19:49,454
MATT: Suddenly your consciousness kind of extends
into all the nearby, and it's rush because there's

1732
01:19:49,454 --> 01:19:56,270
just life all around you, life itself is dark,
it's twisted, but it is living. What do you wish

1733
01:19:56,270 --> 01:20:00,286
to ask of the nearby essence?

1734
01:20:00,286 --> 01:20:12,649
MARISHA: Um, okay. Can I figure out what is
feeding the tree, what the tree, if the tree is

1735
01:20:12,649 --> 01:20:19,310
consuming things around it, what is fueling the
tree?

1736
01:20:19,310 --> 01:20:21,705
MATT: The response?

1737
01:20:21,705 --> 01:20:24,890
MARISHA: I sense a lot coming out from the tree,
that's clear,

1738
01:20:24,890 --> 01:20:27,461
can I sense an energy going in
towards the tree?

1739
01:20:27,461 --> 01:20:31,110
MATT: Well, your question is, what is feeding the
tree? You have to ask a question.

1740
01:20:31,110 --> 01:20:34,760
MARISHA: What is fueling the tree, yes.

1741
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:36,292
MATT: Sondur.

1742
01:20:36,292 --> 01:20:38,108
SAM: Sondur?

1743
01:20:38,108 --> 01:20:39,943
LAURA: We aren't listening to this.

1744
01:20:39,943 --> 01:20:43,879
MARISHA: Sondur.

1745
01:20:43,879 --> 01:20:50,255
TRAVIS: I love having a character who can't read.
No pressure.

1746
01:20:50,255 --> 01:20:55,470
MATT: Sondur is the only response you get.

1747
01:20:55,470 --> 01:21:01,821
MARISHA: What is the tree's weakness?

1748
01:21:01,821 --> 01:21:03,247
SAM: Poovah.

1749
01:21:03,247 --> 01:21:07,340
(All laugh.)

1750
01:21:07,340 --> 01:21:11,900
SAM: Shamalaka.

1751
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:13,582
TALIESIN: Terry.

1752
01:21:13,582 --> 01:21:15,076
LAURA: (laughs) Terry.

1753
01:21:15,076 --> 01:21:19,827
MATT: You get no response, it seems like the
question doesn't take hold in the connection,

1754
01:21:19,827 --> 01:21:25,940
there is no answer to that question. It doesn't
consume

1755
01:21:25,940 --> 01:21:27,915
the question asked as part of the incantation.

1756
01:21:27,915 --> 01:21:31,010
LAURA: Remember, we asked if it was an actual
tree, if it's an actual tree.

1757
01:21:31,010 --> 01:21:37,448
SAM: Has it been eating you?

1758
01:21:37,448 --> 01:21:41,565
LAURA: (whispers) Who is Sondur?

1759
01:21:41,565 --> 01:21:47,524
MARISHA: Who is Sondur? That's actually,
I should've thought about that,

1760
01:21:47,524 --> 01:21:50,116
that's a good one.

1761
01:21:50,116 --> 01:21:55,910
MATT: It has to relate to the area, terrain,
bodies of water, actual information about

1762
01:21:55,910 --> 01:22:01,251
individuals? The living essence of the forest
would not probably know that.

1763
01:22:01,251 --> 01:22:15,277
MARISHA: Okay. Then can I ask the living fauna
around me if this tree is sucking life force from

1764
01:22:15,277 --> 01:22:21,236
them? Is the tree in the middle hurting the plants
all around, like for example--

1765
01:22:21,236 --> 01:22:27,226
MATT: The answer is yes.

1766
01:22:27,226 --> 01:22:28,862
MARISHA: Is that all I got?

1767
01:22:28,862 --> 01:22:30,737
MATT: That's your two questions. You asked one
that wasn't effectual,

1768
01:22:30,737 --> 01:22:36,019
and thus the incantation
did not consider it utilized.

1769
01:22:36,019 --> 01:22:37,897
SAM: Is it a tree?

1770
01:22:37,897 --> 01:22:41,549
MATT: One more question.

1771
01:22:41,549 --> 01:22:47,345
MARISHA: Is the cancerous tree more than just a
tree?

1772
01:22:47,345 --> 01:22:49,124
SAM: Good question.

1773
01:22:49,124 --> 01:22:50,785
MATT: Yes.

1774
01:22:50,785 --> 01:22:51,922
SAM: Yes.

1775
01:22:51,922 --> 01:22:54,201
MARISHA: Sure, that probably... sure.

1776
01:22:54,201 --> 01:22:55,665
TALIESIN: We got a name.

1777
01:22:55,665 --> 01:22:59,330
MATT: And with that, suddenly, you feel the
incantation break its hold with the nearby life

1778
01:22:59,330 --> 01:23:01,966
sources, you begin to sink once again.

1779
01:23:01,966 --> 01:23:03,435
LAURA: (gasps) Pull her out, pull her out.

1780
01:23:03,435 --> 01:23:07,519
MATT: As you guys pull up as you reach up and grab
it, pulling her free from the swampy morass,

1781
01:23:07,519 --> 01:23:11,305
and carry her back up to the entrance of the
mansion.

1782
01:23:11,305 --> 01:23:13,282
SAM: What did he say?

1783
01:23:13,282 --> 01:23:14,548
MARISHA: Sondur.

1784
01:23:14,548 --> 01:23:15,535
SAM: Sondur.

1785
01:23:15,535 --> 01:23:16,758
LAURA: What do you mean, Sondur?

1786
01:23:16,758 --> 01:23:17,989
MARISHA: Sondur, that's...

1787
01:23:17,989 --> 01:23:19,883
LAURA: Is that a band, what is it?

1788
01:23:19,883 --> 01:23:21,039
SAM: Flight of the Sondurs?

1789
01:23:21,039 --> 01:23:23,243
MARISHA: (laughs) Flight of the Sondurs.

1790
01:23:23,243 --> 01:23:24,908
TRAVIS: Is that like an elven word?

1791
01:23:24,908 --> 01:23:26,284
LAURA: Is it an elven word?

1792
01:23:26,284 --> 01:23:27,346
MARISHA: Is it an elven word?

1793
01:23:27,346 --> 01:23:28,300
LAURA: That we've heard?

1794
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:29,634
SAM: Do any of us recognize the word?

1795
01:23:29,634 --> 01:23:34,621
MATT: None of you recognize the word, but it does
sound like a name with elvish background or

1796
01:23:34,621 --> 01:23:40,954
heritage, or at least some sort of ancient elvish
roots to the name structure. It doesn't have

1797
01:23:40,954 --> 01:23:45,685
specific meaning, but there are names you've heard
of people of

1798
01:23:45,685 --> 01:23:51,643
elven lineage that are plays on a similar sound.

1799
01:23:51,643 --> 01:23:55,428
LAURA: Does it sound... I mean, what would those
names mean?

1800
01:23:55,428 --> 01:23:58,711
MATT: Well, I mean, the one that's closest to you
is your father's, which is Syldor.

1801
01:23:58,711 --> 01:24:01,391
LAURA: Right, and he's a dick, so the tree
probably is too.

1802
01:24:01,391 --> 01:24:04,435
SAM: Sondur, Syldor, they're brothers.

1803
01:24:04,435 --> 01:24:06,433
MATT: Totally.

1804
01:24:06,433 --> 01:24:07,819
SAM: Isn't that how it works?

1805
01:24:07,819 --> 01:24:09,601
LAURA: That is how it works. Vex and Vax.

1806
01:24:09,601 --> 01:24:13,222
MARISHA: Percy.

1807
01:24:13,222 --> 01:24:13,977
TALIESIN: Yes?

1808
01:24:13,977 --> 01:24:17,827
MARISHA: You've done a lot of reading of the elven
culture. Do you know anything about a Sondur?

1809
01:24:17,827 --> 01:24:20,292
MATT: You have no idea.

1810
01:24:20,292 --> 01:24:25,646
TALIESIN: I have no idea. I'm racking my brain and
wishing I had access to a library.

1811
01:24:25,646 --> 01:24:27,179
LAURA: Do you have a library here?

1812
01:24:27,179 --> 01:24:31,378
SAM: Do I?

1813
01:24:31,378 --> 01:24:36,205
MATT: Well, you can have one apparate within the
mansion, if you wish.

1814
01:24:36,205 --> 01:24:37,731
SAM: With books?

1815
01:24:37,731 --> 01:24:39,389
MATT: Yeah.

1816
01:24:39,389 --> 01:24:45,670
SAM: Of course I have a library! It's in my
personal chambers where I do all of my studying.

1817
01:24:45,670 --> 01:24:46,980
TRAVIS: Keyleth.

1818
01:24:46,980 --> 01:24:48,982
LAURA: Oh. We have to go to your actual bedroom?

1819
01:24:48,982 --> 01:24:50,530
TALIESIN: It's all pornography. Just the entire
library is like--

1820
01:24:50,530 --> 01:24:51,710
SAM: Only in the back.

1821
01:24:51,710 --> 01:24:53,177
TALIESIN: It's like Beauty and the Beast,
it's just pornography.

1822
01:24:53,177 --> 01:24:54,126
MARISHA: Yes, Grog?

1823
01:24:54,126 --> 01:24:57,689
TRAVIS: Did you ask if the tree was just one
thing?

1824
01:24:57,689 --> 01:25:00,808
MARISHA: It didn't appear to be one thing.

1825
01:25:00,808 --> 01:25:10,379
Because it was harming the plant life
around it. So it's not necessarily all connected,

1826
01:25:10,379 --> 01:25:17,189
it seems. But it is also definitely not just a
tree.

1827
01:25:17,189 --> 01:25:23,974
TRAVIS: What if we, like, salt the earth? That's
an expression.

1828
01:25:23,974 --> 01:25:27,909
TALIESIN: It's more than an expression, it's
legitimately something you do. Unfortunately,

1829
01:25:27,909 --> 01:25:29,713
you need salt for that.

1830
01:25:29,713 --> 01:25:33,300
LAURA: Do we have salt? Do we have lots of salt
here in the mansion, Scanlan?

1831
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:35,176
SAM: It's all over the floor of the kitchen.

1832
01:25:35,176 --> 01:25:37,892
LAURA: Oh, but we can't bring it out, we can't
bring it out.

1833
01:25:37,892 --> 01:25:39,703
TRAVIS: I have 12 gallons of salt water.

1834
01:25:39,703 --> 01:25:41,654
MARISHA: Didn't you get a bunch of salt when you
jumped into the--

1835
01:25:41,654 --> 01:25:43,873
LAURA: I don't know if 12 gallons is enough to
kill a tree.

1836
01:25:43,873 --> 01:25:45,574
MARISHA: --when you did the cannonball contest?

1837
01:25:45,574 --> 01:25:46,668
TALIESIN: That wasn't salt.

1838
01:25:46,668 --> 01:25:50,060
TRAVIS: I've heard them say it before, they're
like, oh, you are the salt of the earth.

1839
01:25:50,060 --> 01:25:55,301
TALIESIN: That wasn't salt, that was something
else, and I used it all for the cannonball.

1840
01:25:55,301 --> 01:25:59,949
SAM: So what's our plan? Do we attack this thing
with brute force? How do we corrupt the ground?

1841
01:25:59,949 --> 01:26:03,939
You can turn the ground to stone, will that help
anything? Right?

1842
01:26:03,939 --> 01:26:07,836
TRAVIS: What's on the other side of this tree?
It's huge, it's a hundred feet.

1843
01:26:07,836 --> 01:26:12,641
TALIESIN: Inside the tree is the bow. I think if
we remove the bow, I think if we find the bow

1844
01:26:12,641 --> 01:26:16,236
inside the tree, I think that's how--

1845
01:26:16,236 --> 01:26:19,302
SAM: That's a lot of tree to search, it could be
way up, it could be in a branch.

1846
01:26:19,302 --> 01:26:21,758
LIAM: What is the legend, at the heart of this
tree?

1847
01:26:21,758 --> 01:26:24,621
TALIESIN: The heart of this tree. I think we go
in.

1848
01:26:24,621 --> 01:26:27,614
TRAVIS: It used to be a titan that had its heart
broken or something.

1849
01:26:27,614 --> 01:26:28,875
LIAM: Probably inside.

1850
01:26:28,875 --> 01:26:30,521
LAURA: Yeah, what if the--

1851
01:26:30,521 --> 01:26:38,274
SAM: It says it now acts as the heart to a
cancerous tree corrupting the verdant land.

1852
01:26:38,274 --> 01:26:41,004
TALIESIN: If I were the heart of a tree,
I'd be in the center.

1853
01:26:41,004 --> 01:26:46,159
MARISHA: It was a bow that felled the titans.

1854
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:50,531
LAURA: I feel like we probably should've done some
research on Fenthras before we came out here.

1855
01:26:50,531 --> 01:26:52,820
SAM: We can go to my library.

1856
01:26:52,820 --> 01:26:54,562
LAURA: Look in your library, I am following you to
your library.

1857
01:26:54,562 --> 01:26:56,268
TALIESIN: I'm curious to see the library,
I just want to see

1858
01:26:56,268 --> 01:26:57,740
what a giant disaster this is.

1859
01:26:57,740 --> 01:27:00,546
MATT: You did receive a little information about
it from Allura, from her research as well.

1860
01:27:00,546 --> 01:27:02,006
LAURA: Yes, that's right, that's right!

1861
01:27:02,006 --> 01:27:04,164
MATT: Did you write that down?

1862
01:27:04,164 --> 01:27:05,768
SAM: Maybe?

1863
01:27:05,768 --> 01:27:08,911
LAURA: Yeah, but I listened to her real hard when
she was talking.

1864
01:27:08,911 --> 01:27:10,867
SAM: Marisha writes down everything.

1865
01:27:10,867 --> 01:27:12,744
MARISHA: I do, it's just... where.

1866
01:27:12,744 --> 01:27:14,216
SAM: The bigger question is how does she find it.

1867
01:27:14,216 --> 01:27:17,867
MARISHA: How do I find it, exactly. When did we
talk to her?

1868
01:27:17,867 --> 01:27:21,314
MATT: Last time you were in Whitestone, right
before you left for the actual Feywild.

1869
01:27:21,314 --> 01:27:24,879
LAURA: Aw man, I don't think I wrote it down,
I think I was just listening.

1870
01:27:24,879 --> 01:27:27,641
MARISHA: All right, Feywild, hang on.

1871
01:27:27,641 --> 01:27:30,851
SAM: I know that Simon's mom is Elwen.

1872
01:27:30,851 --> 01:27:34,315
MATT: There you go. See? Perfect. That was
pre-stream.

1873
01:27:34,315 --> 01:27:39,643
SAM: I know that...

1874
01:27:39,643 --> 01:27:41,826
LAURA: Fenthras! No, that's all I wrote.

1875
01:27:41,826 --> 01:27:44,026
MATT: (laughs) You were so excited for a second.
So excited.

1876
01:27:44,026 --> 01:27:46,203
LAURA: I was so excited 'cause I saw it written
down, but no, I didn't write.

1877
01:27:46,203 --> 01:27:47,726
MATT: No.

1878
01:27:47,726 --> 01:27:48,883
LAURA: I'm sorry.

1879
01:27:48,883 --> 01:27:50,438
TRAVIS: You're gonna make me check my notes?

1880
01:27:50,438 --> 01:27:54,632
LAURA: I didn't write it down. Dammit. Balls.
But I have a real good--

1881
01:27:54,632 --> 01:27:58,003
SAM: I know that there's a hatmaker named Deirdre
somewhere in the world.

1882
01:27:58,003 --> 01:28:00,038
MATT: Guys. You guys.

1883
01:28:00,038 --> 01:28:04,087
LIAM: Would a really successful history check help
Vex remember what the fuck she was told?

1884
01:28:04,087 --> 01:28:08,835
MATT: (laughs) Go ahead and make a history check.

1885
01:28:08,835 --> 01:28:10,720
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

1886
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:13,358
TRAVIS: I've got vegemite written down.

1887
01:28:13,358 --> 01:28:15,435
TALIESIN: I think that's a shopping list.

1888
01:28:15,435 --> 01:28:18,641
MARISHA: God, I was clearly writing incredibly
fast.

1889
01:28:18,641 --> 01:28:20,510
LAURA: Shit history.

1890
01:28:20,510 --> 01:28:21,596
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1891
01:28:21,596 --> 01:28:22,677
SAM: Did you roll it?

1892
01:28:22,677 --> 01:28:23,846
LAURA: 17 is what I rolled.

1893
01:28:23,846 --> 01:28:24,814
SAM: Well, that's something.

1894
01:28:24,814 --> 01:28:26,200
MATT: 17 is not too bad.

1895
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:27,595
MARISHA: I have 'archfey, black heart'.

1896
01:28:27,595 --> 01:28:28,971
MATT: Yes.

1897
01:28:28,971 --> 01:28:31,900
LAURA: Okay, that jogged my memory a little bit,
I sort of remember.

1898
01:28:31,900 --> 01:28:33,127
MATT: There you go.

1899
01:28:33,127 --> 01:28:34,819
MARISHA: He was an arch-- yes, go ahead.

1900
01:28:34,819 --> 01:28:43,191
MATT: There was an archfey that existed here that
was apparently the holder of Fenthras that was

1901
01:28:43,191 --> 01:28:49,184
betrayed and his heart became corrupted and thus
became the center of this corruption.

1902
01:28:49,184 --> 01:28:53,435
SAM: There you go.

1903
01:28:53,435 --> 01:28:56,300
MARISHA: So we can assume that the archfey is
probably Sondur.

1904
01:28:56,300 --> 01:28:57,683
LAURA: Sondur.

1905
01:28:57,683 --> 01:29:03,045
MARISHA: And he's probably still inside the tree,
and he probably is not gonna let go of his bow.

1906
01:29:03,045 --> 01:29:06,035
LAURA: What exactly is an archfey?

1907
01:29:06,035 --> 01:29:13,043
MATT: An archfey, from your knowledge and
experience, they're very powerful fey creatures,

1908
01:29:13,043 --> 01:29:17,183
some largely belonged to some of the leading
courts in the Feywild,

1909
01:29:17,183 --> 01:29:18,949
the Seelie and the Unseelie.

1910
01:29:18,949 --> 01:29:19,925
LIAM: Oberon.

1911
01:29:19,925 --> 01:29:20,812
LAURA: Oh.

1912
01:29:20,812 --> 01:29:24,306
MATT: Some unaffiliated. Like for instance,
in Midsummer Night's Dream,

1913
01:29:24,306 --> 01:29:26,745
Titania and Oberon would totally be archfey.

1914
01:29:26,745 --> 01:29:28,139
LAURA: Archfey. Okay.

1915
01:29:28,139 --> 01:29:33,440
MATT: Very, very powerful and influential fey
creatures that both have understanding and powers

1916
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:37,151
to bend the surrounding Feywild to their will.

1917
01:29:37,151 --> 01:29:42,157
MARISHA: And then he must have fought in what was
known as the Calamity?

1918
01:29:42,157 --> 01:29:44,123
TRAVIS: Yes.

1919
01:29:44,123 --> 01:29:50,445
MATT: Well, the Calamity wasn't against the
titans, the Calamity, those were the final battles

1920
01:29:50,445 --> 01:29:54,747
of the gods physically on Exandria before the
Divergence in which they

1921
01:29:54,747 --> 01:29:58,415
separated from all their creations for good.

1922
01:29:58,415 --> 01:30:00,535
MARISHA: Where does 'black heart' come from?

1923
01:30:00,535 --> 01:30:03,176
MARISHA: Why did I write that down?

1924
01:30:03,176 --> 01:30:06,029
MATT: His heart was corrupted? I don't know why
you wrote it down.

1925
01:30:06,029 --> 01:30:08,057
MARISHA: I wrote down 'black heart'.

1926
01:30:08,057 --> 01:30:09,424
TALIESIN: Seemed like a thing.

1927
01:30:09,424 --> 01:30:10,667
MARISHA: Seemed important.

1928
01:30:10,667 --> 01:30:11,799
MATT: Sure.

1929
01:30:11,799 --> 01:30:13,048
LAURA: Okay.

1930
01:30:13,048 --> 01:30:14,565
MARISHA: 'Cause he was corrupted. Okay.

1931
01:30:14,565 --> 01:30:16,901
SAM: So we're fighting an archfey inside a tree.

1932
01:30:16,901 --> 01:30:20,030
LAURA: So we know how to fight the tree. Okay.

1933
01:30:20,114 --> 01:30:22,024
SAM: We gotta get the archfey out of the tree.

1934
01:30:22,024 --> 01:30:24,542
TALIESIN: We gotta get the archfey out of the
tree.

1935
01:30:24,542 --> 01:30:26,033
MARISHA: So someone's going into the tree.

1936
01:30:26,033 --> 01:30:27,648
LAURA: Maybe we can talk to it.

1937
01:30:27,648 --> 01:30:29,363
SAM: What's its name again? Sorry.

1938
01:30:29,363 --> 01:30:30,338
MATT: Sondur.

1939
01:30:30,338 --> 01:30:31,405
SAM: Sondur.

1940
01:30:31,405 --> 01:30:32,806
MATT: Was the name you were given.

1941
01:30:32,806 --> 01:30:34,742
LAURA: Maybe if we call out to him, he'll talk to
us.

1942
01:30:34,742 --> 01:30:36,235
MARISHA: Maybe.

1943
01:30:36,235 --> 01:30:38,763
LIAM: Maybe if we put Shorthalt forward...

1944
01:30:38,763 --> 01:30:40,431
LAURA: You're so charming.

1945
01:30:40,431 --> 01:30:41,836
TALIESIN: You are so charming.

1946
01:30:41,836 --> 01:30:42,846
SAM: Yeah, sure.

1947
01:30:42,846 --> 01:30:44,970
TALIESIN: And you have so much good advice.

1948
01:30:44,970 --> 01:30:46,144
TRAVIS: Do fey creatures live a long time?

1949
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:47,298
SAM: Hey, Sondur, Sondur, give us your bow.

1950
01:30:47,298 --> 01:30:50,022
TRAVIS: What if he was betrayed by something in
the Feywild, and we found that thing,

1951
01:30:50,022 --> 01:30:51,622
whether it was a comrade or a--

1952
01:30:51,622 --> 01:30:56,027
LIAM: Well, that seems likely, but we'd have to
turn over every stone in la-la land to find it.

1953
01:30:56,027 --> 01:30:58,502
LAURA: Or we have to talk to him and find out,
and maybe...

1954
01:30:58,502 --> 01:31:01,600
TRAVIS: Yeah, and you can talk to trees.

1955
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:06,195
MARISHA: I can. I can attempt to talk to the
tree.

1956
01:31:06,195 --> 01:31:08,108
TALIESIN: After a rest, I'm going to sleep.

1957
01:31:08,108 --> 01:31:09,253
LIAM: Scanlan and Keyleth combo?

1958
01:31:09,253 --> 01:31:10,197
MARISHA: Huh?

1959
01:31:10,197 --> 01:31:13,063
LIAM: Scanlan and Keyleth duo to talk to the
tree?

1960
01:31:13,063 --> 01:31:14,847
SAM: What are we asking the tree?

1961
01:31:14,847 --> 01:31:15,977
LAURA: In the morning.

1962
01:31:15,977 --> 01:31:17,331
SAM: Yeah, but what are we--

1963
01:31:17,331 --> 01:31:18,572
TRAVIS: Who betrayed it.

1964
01:31:18,572 --> 01:31:21,787
LAURA: We're gonna talk to Sondur and see,
you know, why are you acting this way?

1965
01:31:21,787 --> 01:31:24,916
LIAM: Yes, how can we help you, how can we fix
what's going on?

1966
01:31:24,916 --> 01:31:28,367
LAURA: Oh no, look at his face, he looks like that
is a very bad idea.

1967
01:31:28,367 --> 01:31:29,503
MARISHA: (laughs) Why are you acting this way?

1968
01:31:29,503 --> 01:31:33,729
MATT: No, I'm just, I'm just enjoying you guys
planning and plotting.

1969
01:31:33,729 --> 01:31:37,100
SAM: We're just gonna say hey, Sondur, how can we
help you?

1970
01:31:37,100 --> 01:31:40,232
LAURA: Yeah yeah yeah, like how can we help you?
Why are you hurting?

1971
01:31:40,232 --> 01:31:41,863
MARISHA: Please give us your bow, yeah.

1972
01:31:41,863 --> 01:31:44,601
LAURA: No, no, don't even bring up the bow right
now, let's just try to help him out.

1973
01:31:44,601 --> 01:31:50,920
MARISHA: So wait, are we here on a mission to
cleanse the land? Is that what we're posing as?

1974
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:53,006
We're like missionaries?

1975
01:31:53,006 --> 01:31:55,920
LAURA: I mean, if we did cleanse the land,
that would be a wonderful thing.

1976
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:57,249
TALIESIN: That would be great.

1977
01:31:57,249 --> 01:31:58,892
MARISHA: It would be a wonderful thing.

1978
01:31:58,892 --> 01:32:00,501
TALIESIN: But we're also getting the bow.

1979
01:32:00,501 --> 01:32:04,289
LAURA: The bow is a wonderful thing. I have a
pretty fucking cool bow now, I don't even know if

1980
01:32:04,289 --> 01:32:08,363
this new one's gonna be as cool. You don't even
know what Mythcarver does, Titanstone Knuckles

1981
01:32:08,363 --> 01:32:12,107
aren't advancing at all, who knows? Maybe this bow
is shit and

1982
01:32:12,107 --> 01:32:15,245
the whole point of this is so we can help people.

1983
01:32:15,245 --> 01:32:17,298
TALIESIN: I think it'll give you wings so you can
fly.

1984
01:32:17,298 --> 01:32:19,373
TRAVIS: Can't we just say that we're obsessed with
the hundred-foot fucking

1985
01:32:19,373 --> 01:32:21,679
moving tree in the middle of the Feywild?

1986
01:32:21,679 --> 01:32:23,677
LAURA: Maybe we just think it's really cool.

1987
01:32:23,677 --> 01:32:26,122
TRAVIS: Yeah, we've come to talk to it, no
bullshit.

1988
01:32:26,122 --> 01:32:27,217
SAM: We're fanboys.

1989
01:32:27,217 --> 01:32:28,004
LAURA: Yeah.

1990
01:32:28,004 --> 01:32:28,763
TRAVIS: No.

1991
01:32:28,763 --> 01:32:30,364
LAURA: Yeah, like we've heard tale and it's
wonderful.

1992
01:32:30,364 --> 01:32:32,070
TRAVIS: We wanna know what's up.

1993
01:32:32,070 --> 01:32:34,446
SAM: Great. That sounds like it's gonna end well.

1994
01:32:34,446 --> 01:32:36,396
TRAVIS: Well, if he pulls any shit then we kill
it.

1995
01:32:36,396 --> 01:32:37,401
SAM: Okay.

1996
01:32:37,401 --> 01:32:42,069
TALIESIN: I am going to sleep, there's nothing
that can be solved right now that cannot be solved

1997
01:32:42,069 --> 01:32:43,944
over coffee and bacon.

1998
01:32:43,944 --> 01:32:45,707
LAURA: We don't have bacon.

1999
01:32:45,707 --> 01:32:47,046
MARISHA: Just chicken and waffles.

2000
01:32:47,046 --> 01:32:48,606
TALIESIN: I will make bacon from chicken.

2001
01:32:48,606 --> 01:32:50,083
SAM: Chicken-skin bacon.

2002
01:32:50,083 --> 01:32:51,272
LAURA: Ooh. That actually sounds really good.

2003
01:32:51,272 --> 01:32:52,735
TALIESIN: That actually sounds really good.

2004
01:32:52,735 --> 01:32:54,259
LIAM: Tofurkey.

2005
01:32:54,259 --> 01:32:56,023
MATT: All right. You guys all taking your long
rest?

2006
01:32:56,023 --> 01:32:57,368
(Various sounds of agreement.)

2007
01:32:57,368 --> 01:32:58,444
MATT: All right, you all--

2008
01:32:58,444 --> 01:33:00,246
LIAM: No, I'm going to knock on my sister's door
before she falls asleep.

2009
01:33:00,246 --> 01:33:01,310
MATT: All right.

2010
01:33:01,310 --> 01:33:03,304
LAURA: Oh shit, I'm pretty tired, what's up?

2011
01:33:03,304 --> 01:33:09,200
LIAM: Hey, well, you know, we don't get a lot of
time to talk alone because everything is so fucked

2012
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:19,450
up, but you seemed really on-edge. More than
normal, when we lived there before.

2013
01:33:19,450 --> 01:33:21,143
You know what I'm talking about.

2014
01:33:21,143 --> 01:33:23,020
LAURA: Oh, yeah.

2015
01:33:23,020 --> 01:33:25,676
LIAM: Are you all right?

2016
01:33:25,676 --> 01:33:43,054
LAURA: Um. Yes? I don't know. It's the weirdest
thing, I never realized how much it affected me

2017
01:33:43,054 --> 01:33:52,183
until we actually were faced with it again.
It was good, standing in front of him with

2018
01:33:52,183 --> 01:33:57,364
everyone else, wasn't it?

2019
01:33:57,364 --> 01:34:07,179
LIAM: I've... he's not a concern for me anymore.
I don't think fondly back on it, we have bigger

2020
01:34:07,179 --> 01:34:17,599
things on our plates, but I do care how he affects
you, and there is no question how much it affected

2021
01:34:17,599 --> 01:34:25,854
you when Percival made his offer in that room,
and I was a little surprised. And I'm not trying

2022
01:34:25,854 --> 01:34:36,265
to start an argument or anything like that,
I know why he did it, of course. And every fairy

2023
01:34:36,265 --> 01:34:44,359
within a thousand miles of that room could see how
deeply it affected you, and it surprised me,

2024
01:34:44,359 --> 01:34:56,532
because... Look, if that makes you happy,
it is to be embraced, and I'm certainly in

2025
01:34:56,532 --> 01:35:04,844
support of anything that gives our father
heartburn, but...

2026
01:35:04,844 --> 01:35:18,040
I'm sorry, his offer, in your brother's
eyes, is a bit like gilding a lily or framing a

2027
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:34,164
sunset. You have always been the coolest person I
have known, ever, in my life. And you still are.

2028
01:35:34,164 --> 01:35:49,362
You're already perfect, at least in your
brother's eyes. And I guess I just hope you

2029
01:35:49,362 --> 01:35:57,631
believe in you as much as I do, because it's quite
a bit.

2030
01:35:57,631 --> 01:36:06,910
LAURA: Thank you. I mean, I can't give back the
title, that would be kind of shit.

2031
01:36:06,910 --> 01:36:09,050
LIAM: Well, you're a countessa know, I understand,
that's what you are.

2032
01:36:09,050 --> 01:36:11,576
LAURA: Baroness, no, baroness, actually.

2033
01:36:11,576 --> 01:36:16,194
LIAM: All right.

2034
01:36:16,194 --> 01:36:22,370
LAURA: Just a little bit cooler than before.
Just a little?

2035
01:36:22,370 --> 01:36:29,025
LIAM: Whatever floats your boat, Stubby, but,
you know. Just don't wuss out on me now.

2036
01:36:29,025 --> 01:36:30,639
LAURA: I won't.

2037
01:36:30,639 --> 01:36:33,239
LIAM: All right? You've always been stronger than
me, I need you to keep doing that.

2038
01:36:33,239 --> 01:36:36,545
LAURA: It's all an act, dear.

2039
01:36:36,545 --> 01:36:44,078
LIAM: Bullshit. That's it.

2040
01:36:44,078 --> 01:36:47,893
LAURA: I love you. Thank you.

2041
01:36:47,893 --> 01:36:50,872
LIAM: I love you too.

2042
01:36:50,872 --> 01:36:53,589
LAURA: Go get some sleep. Your feathers are all
ruffled.

2043
01:36:53,589 --> 01:37:01,861
LIAM: All right.

2044
01:37:01,861 --> 01:37:06,342
MATT: All right, so as you separate and go find
your own ways to rest, you guys find your way to

2045
01:37:06,342 --> 01:37:13,245
your dreams for the evening, getting a full
night's rest, HP resolved to full, spells

2046
01:37:13,245 --> 01:37:16,227
returned, and we're gonna go ahead and take a
break here, restroom break for a few minutes,

2047
01:37:16,227 --> 01:37:18,874
we'll see you guys back here in just a minute.

2048
01:37:18,874 --> 01:37:20,807
Once again, thank you, Lootcrate, you guys are
awesome.

2049
01:37:20,807 --> 01:37:22,540
ALL: Lootcrate!

2050
01:37:22,540 --> 01:37:24,522
MATT: All right, we'll see you guys here in a few
minutes.

2051
01:37:24,522 --> 01:46:27,560
[break]

2052
01:46:27,655 --> 01:46:29,136
SAM: Lootcrate, lootcrate, lootcrate.

2053
01:46:29,136 --> 01:46:33,071
MATT: Welcome back, everyone. So, we had a quick
break, you guys, coming to consciousness the next

2054
01:46:33,071 --> 01:46:41,392
morning, freshly rested, the smell of some cooked
chicken in the downstairs area

2055
01:46:41,392 --> 01:46:44,490
and a little bit of
chicken-skin bacon...

2056
01:46:44,490 --> 01:46:48,274
LAURA: Can I go knock on Percy's door before we
head downstairs, just really fast?

2057
01:46:48,274 --> 01:46:49,776
MATT: Yeah.

2058
01:46:49,776 --> 01:46:52,653
LAURA: Um. Percival?

2059
01:46:52,653 --> 01:46:54,157
TALIESIN: Yes, yes, good morning.

2060
01:46:54,157 --> 01:46:58,744
LAURA: Sorry. Good morning. I forgot you're grumpy
when you wake up.

2061
01:46:58,744 --> 01:47:00,503
TALIESIN: It's all right.

2062
01:47:00,503 --> 01:47:08,135
LAURA: Look, Vax came and talked to me last night,
and he actually reminded me of something that I

2063
01:47:08,135 --> 01:47:10,907
forgot to say to you, which is: thank you.
Seriously.

2064
01:47:10,907 --> 01:47:16,921
We haven't really had a moment to say
anything, and...

2065
01:47:16,921 --> 01:47:18,062
TALIESIN: No.

2066
01:47:18,062 --> 01:47:28,505
LAURA: Really, what you did back in Syngorn was
more than I ever expected, and honestly it's,

2067
01:47:28,505 --> 01:47:35,883
I don't know of any other time that somebody has
stuck up for me quite as much, outside of Vax.

2068
01:47:35,883 --> 01:47:38,556
So thank you.

2069
01:47:38,556 --> 01:47:44,333
TALIESIN: You're welcome. And... it's the lovely
thing about a title, and I had one to give,

2070
01:47:44,333 --> 01:47:53,279
is that it's, when used appropriately and
properly, it's mostly there to remind you you

2071
01:47:53,279 --> 01:47:54,894
don't really need it.

2072
01:47:54,894 --> 01:47:58,209
LAURA: Right. Question, though?

2073
01:47:58,209 --> 01:47:59,567
TALIESIN: Yes?

2074
01:47:59,567 --> 01:48:07,804
LAURA: Because I sort of realized, being a
baroness of Whitestone, that I literally owe my

2075
01:48:07,804 --> 01:48:10,988
fealty and allegiance to... you.

2076
01:48:10,988 --> 01:48:13,019
TALIESIN: Yes.

2077
01:48:13,019 --> 01:48:14,235
LAURA: All right.

2078
01:48:14,235 --> 01:48:16,556
TALIESIN: Well, technically my sister, but yes.

2079
01:48:16,556 --> 01:48:17,502
LAURA: Okay.

2080
01:48:17,502 --> 01:48:19,279
TALIESIN: If that makes you feel a little better.

2081
01:48:19,279 --> 01:48:25,402
LAURA: Thank you, Grand Sire de Rolo, and if
there's anything you ever need in return,

2082
01:48:25,402 --> 01:48:26,645
all you have to do is ask.

2083
01:48:26,645 --> 01:48:33,774
TALIESIN: Never do that again, that was very
weird. It was really, it was... it was worth it to

2084
01:48:33,774 --> 01:48:35,375
see the look on his face.

2085
01:48:35,375 --> 01:48:36,685
LAURA: It was quite wonderful.

2086
01:48:36,685 --> 01:48:40,058
TALIESIN: It was quite wonderful. No, and it
worked out well, because technically speaking

2087
01:48:40,058 --> 01:48:44,729
there's only really about 15 foot square that's
actually standing

2088
01:48:44,729 --> 01:48:48,547
that you technically have a baronry over.

2089
01:48:48,547 --> 01:48:49,375
LAURA: Oh.

2090
01:48:49,375 --> 01:48:52,722
TALIESIN: And at the moment it is currently a
shrine to the Raven Queen,

2091
01:48:52,722 --> 01:48:54,517
so that works out well.

2092
01:48:54,517 --> 01:48:59,363
LAURA: Oh, that's what... so technically we gave
it to Zahra, didn't we?

2093
01:48:59,363 --> 01:49:00,989
TALIESIN: No, she's just fixing it up for us.

2094
01:49:00,989 --> 01:49:02,406
LAURA: Okay, all right.

2095
01:49:02,406 --> 01:49:09,769
TALIESIN: We did not give it to her. It wasn't
mine to give. Just the title. You're welcome,

2096
01:49:09,769 --> 01:49:15,124
and... it doesn't change anything.

2097
01:49:15,124 --> 01:49:18,190
LAURA: Good, that would be very strange,
wouldn't it?

2098
01:49:18,190 --> 01:49:19,884
TALIESIN: Yeah. Although I imagine you're
eventually going to

2099
01:49:19,884 --> 01:49:22,989
become very insufferable, but yes.

2100
01:49:22,989 --> 01:49:24,504
LAURA: Only sometimes, dear.

2101
01:49:24,504 --> 01:49:27,132
TALIESIN: Oh, you have to be... there's a thing.
But we'll get to that later. There is a thing,

2102
01:49:27,132 --> 01:49:29,549
I forgot, there is a thing.

2103
01:49:29,549 --> 01:49:31,717
LAURA: Does it have to do with the Hunt?

2104
01:49:31,717 --> 01:49:34,895
TALIESIN: Yes, a thing, we'll get to that,
it's really not important right now. That's if we

2105
01:49:34,895 --> 01:49:37,881
survive, that would be very important, but right
now it's not.

2106
01:49:37,881 --> 01:49:39,785
LAURA: Not... not a given.

2107
01:49:39,785 --> 01:49:40,605
TALIESIN: No.

2108
01:49:40,605 --> 01:49:41,876
LAURA: We might die today.

2109
01:49:41,876 --> 01:49:42,724
TALIESIN: We might.

2110
01:49:42,724 --> 01:49:44,197
LAURA: I'm gonna get some coffee.

2111
01:49:44,197 --> 01:49:46,646
TALIESIN: I think that's an excellent idea.
Let me join you.

2112
01:49:46,646 --> 01:49:54,251
MATT: You all eventually find your way down,
breakfast served in a central dining table with

2113
01:49:54,251 --> 01:49:56,506
no platters, no silverware.

2114
01:49:56,506 --> 01:49:58,147
LAURA: Thanks, Grog.

2115
01:49:58,147 --> 01:50:00,873
TRAVIS: It's a mansion! We could eat somewhere
else.

2116
01:50:00,873 --> 01:50:04,706
MATT: The meals are just placed literally on the
table.

2117
01:50:04,706 --> 01:50:09,556
TRAVIS: Bare-bones. I like it.

2118
01:50:09,556 --> 01:50:12,910
SAM: All right, eat up, let's go.

2119
01:50:12,910 --> 01:50:17,765
MATT: You finish your meal, and you guys prepared
yourselves, what are you doing?

2120
01:50:17,765 --> 01:50:19,383
SAM: We go out into the world, right?

2121
01:50:19,383 --> 01:50:20,486
TRAVIS: Bum-rush the tree.

2122
01:50:20,486 --> 01:50:21,443
LAURA: Uh-uh.

2123
01:50:21,443 --> 01:50:22,971
TALIESIN: I have shoes for everybody.

2124
01:50:22,971 --> 01:50:24,672
SAM: Oh!

2125
01:50:24,672 --> 01:50:25,658
MARISHA: Yes.

2126
01:50:25,658 --> 01:50:26,954
SAM: Those are terrible shoes.

2127
01:50:26,954 --> 01:50:28,483
TALIESIN: They're awful, I'm aware.

2128
01:50:28,483 --> 01:50:29,869
TRAVIS: We put the shoes on?

2129
01:50:29,869 --> 01:50:30,937
LIAM: What do they look like?

2130
01:50:30,937 --> 01:50:32,248
TALIESIN: We're going to wear the shoes.

2131
01:50:32,248 --> 01:50:32,911
SAM: Yeah, describe them.

2132
01:50:32,911 --> 01:50:36,204
TALIESIN: They're swamp shoes. They're circular,
they're like large circles, and there's like a

2133
01:50:36,204 --> 01:50:39,235
base connected to them, and whole thing's
connected together with ropes.

2134
01:50:39,235 --> 01:50:42,642
MARISHA: Kind of like snowshoes but with more
surface area.

2135
01:50:42,642 --> 01:50:44,324
TRAVIS: I'm only wearing that if it helps.

2136
01:50:44,324 --> 01:50:48,997
TALIESIN: It does. It will keep you from sinking
into the muck. It will allow you to, you'll have

2137
01:50:48,997 --> 01:50:53,519
to walk very slowly, you can't walk very quickly,
and if things get hairy you can cut them off,

2138
01:50:53,519 --> 01:50:56,208
they're just wood and rope, they're not that
complicated.

2139
01:50:56,208 --> 01:50:58,034
MARISHA: Basically, wood paddles on our feet.

2140
01:50:58,034 --> 01:50:59,984
TALIESIN: Yes. Move like a giant frog.

2141
01:50:59,984 --> 01:51:01,202
MARISHA: Yeah.

2142
01:51:01,202 --> 01:51:02,976
TRAVIS: I put the giant frog-shoes on.

2143
01:51:02,976 --> 01:51:06,745
MATT: All right, you put them on. You guys exit
the mansion?

2144
01:51:06,745 --> 01:51:10,646
LIAM: I set the Deathwalker's Ward for necrotic
damage.

2145
01:51:10,646 --> 01:51:12,651
MATT: Okay, necrotic damage is set. Okay.
As you guys emerge--

2146
01:51:12,651 --> 01:51:17,711
LAURA: Oh. Wait.

2147
01:51:17,711 --> 01:51:20,051
TALIESIN: You don't need them, though. You're the
one person who doesn't need them.

2148
01:51:20,051 --> 01:51:24,685
LAURA: How long does Protection Against Poison
last? Oh, it's only an hour, okay, so no,

2149
01:51:24,685 --> 01:51:26,063
I don't want to cast it yet.

2150
01:51:26,063 --> 01:51:27,153
MATT: Okay.

2151
01:51:27,153 --> 01:51:28,434
MARISHA: But you have that.

2152
01:51:28,434 --> 01:51:29,298
LAURA: I do.

2153
01:51:29,298 --> 01:51:30,478
MARISHA: I won't take that.

2154
01:51:30,478 --> 01:51:32,260
SAM: Maybe now would be, we're going straight to
the tree, right?

2155
01:51:32,260 --> 01:51:33,524
MARISHA: Are we still doing our--

2156
01:51:33,524 --> 01:51:34,737
LAURA: Aren't you going to try to talk to it?

2157
01:51:34,737 --> 01:51:39,225
TALIESIN: Talk to it, see what happens, and if
everything goes terribly, we just retreat back to

2158
01:51:39,225 --> 01:51:41,308
the mansion, it's not going anywhere anytime
soon.

2159
01:51:41,308 --> 01:51:42,926
SAM: Should any of us hide?

2160
01:51:42,926 --> 01:51:44,670
TALIESIN: I'm going to keep back in the treeline.

2161
01:51:44,670 --> 01:51:49,195
LAURA: I can only cast it on one person, though,
Keyleth. I don't have, I'm not as good with

2162
01:51:49,195 --> 01:51:52,777
spells as you, so if you can do it to multiple
people, it might be good.

2163
01:51:52,777 --> 01:51:54,926
MATT: All right.

2164
01:51:54,926 --> 01:51:57,371
LIAM: Do we have any fancy, um, fancy--

2165
01:51:57,371 --> 01:51:58,336
LAURA: (posh voice) Fancy?

2166
01:51:58,336 --> 01:52:03,336
LIAM: Crystal bowls for Keyleth to crush up and
feed us from?

2167
01:52:03,336 --> 01:52:04,198
LAURA: What?

2168
01:52:04,198 --> 01:52:05,017
SAM: Crystal what?

2169
01:52:05,017 --> 01:52:06,185
LAURA: Oh, like a Fancy--

2170
01:52:06,185 --> 01:52:07,273
LIAM: Heroes' Feast, yeah.

2171
01:52:07,273 --> 01:52:11,919
LAURA: Heroes' Feast? I don't know if we have--

2172
01:52:11,919 --> 01:52:12,796
LIAM: Never mind.

2173
01:52:12,796 --> 01:52:14,376
MATT: I don't think you have one purchased and
ready.

2174
01:52:14,376 --> 01:52:15,635
TALIESIN: I don't think we have one.

2175
01:52:15,635 --> 01:52:17,941
LIAM: I don't claim to understand anything.

2176
01:52:17,941 --> 01:52:19,769
MARISHA: We'd have to make that decision now,
while I'm learning

2177
01:52:19,769 --> 01:52:21,866
my spells at the top of the day.

2178
01:52:21,866 --> 01:52:22,701
TALIESIN: No, no.

2179
01:52:22,701 --> 01:52:23,673
SAM: Don't do it.

2180
01:52:23,673 --> 01:52:24,905
LAURA: We should've done it last night if we were
gonna do it.

2181
01:52:24,905 --> 01:52:26,130
MATT: Yeah.

2182
01:52:26,130 --> 01:52:28,004
TALIESIN: It'll be fine.

2183
01:52:28,004 --> 01:52:32,276
LAURA: It's gonna be fine, we're all gonna die.

2184
01:52:32,276 --> 01:52:34,432
SAM: All right.

2185
01:52:34,432 --> 01:52:38,393
LAURA: How are you guys gonna go talk to him,
are you just like walking to him?

2186
01:52:38,393 --> 01:52:41,290
TALIESIN: A tree is just a door that hasn't been
made yet, remember.

2187
01:52:41,290 --> 01:52:48,116
MARISHA: That is true. That is an old Druidish
proverb.

2188
01:52:48,116 --> 01:52:49,862
TALIESIN: It's an old Druidish one?

2189
01:52:49,862 --> 01:52:52,476
MARISHA: Yep.

2190
01:52:52,476 --> 01:52:52,995
TALIESIN: Thank you.

2191
01:52:52,995 --> 01:52:55,988
MATT: All right. So. You guys emerge from the
mansion?

2192
01:52:55,988 --> 01:52:57,386
SAM: Yeah, anyone want to go stealth or anything?

2193
01:52:57,386 --> 01:52:58,505
LAURA: Yeah yeah yeah.

2194
01:52:58,505 --> 01:53:00,473
SAM: It's just gonna be all of us presenting
ourself?

2195
01:53:00,473 --> 01:53:04,003
LAURA: Maybe we'll go stealth... well, can a tree
see us? I dunno. Let's go stealth.

2196
01:53:04,003 --> 01:53:05,990
MATT: All right.

2197
01:53:05,990 --> 01:53:07,799
LAURA: Why not? And you guys can go talk to it.

2198
01:53:07,799 --> 01:53:08,719
SAM: All right.

2199
01:53:08,719 --> 01:53:10,504
MATT: Roll stealth checks as you emerge from the
mansion,

2200
01:53:10,504 --> 01:53:13,841
up into the boughs of the tree where you
left the exit.

2201
01:53:13,841 --> 01:53:17,063
TRAVIS: You don't think we're, like, perfectly on
this tree's radar?

2202
01:53:17,063 --> 01:53:20,126
That going stealth is
insulting?

2203
01:53:20,126 --> 01:53:22,097
MARISHA: I'm kinda wondering if the tree has a
tremor-sense.

2204
01:53:22,097 --> 01:53:24,652
LAURA: Oh, that's true. All right, all right,
you're right.

2205
01:53:24,652 --> 01:53:27,512
SAM: Don't do stealth, I'll present us all as a
group.

2206
01:53:27,512 --> 01:53:28,934
LAURA: Okay.

2207
01:53:28,934 --> 01:53:35,763
MATT: All right. You emerge. Still the dusklight,
that kind of warm purplish-orange perpetual

2208
01:53:35,763 --> 01:53:41,133
sunset glow in the sky. The tree there remains.
You glance out. That little pocket where the

2209
01:53:41,133 --> 01:53:46,789
trees were is filled once more. The trees now
stand, the pocket is now done.

2210
01:53:46,789 --> 01:53:50,270
LAURA: That's where, that's where the hole was!
But it's not a hole anymore!

2211
01:53:50,270 --> 01:53:55,882
MATT: Make a perception check as you're looking.

2212
01:53:55,882 --> 01:53:57,910
LAURA: That's good, that's good. 29.

2213
01:53:57,910 --> 01:54:05,456
MATT: 29. About three-quarters of a mile further
west from your current location, there is now a

2214
01:54:05,456 --> 01:54:10,884
different opening in the canopy, similar size,
but even further out that way.

2215
01:54:10,884 --> 01:54:16,784
LAURA: What the fuck? It's further away.
Trees fucking moved. At least it's further away

2216
01:54:16,784 --> 01:54:18,856
from us and not closer to us.

2217
01:54:18,856 --> 01:54:24,537
MARISHA: Wait, is it the same... maybe it is
something big blocking it, with like an invisible

2218
01:54:24,537 --> 01:54:29,492
field? I don't know. I don't know.

2219
01:54:29,492 --> 01:54:32,738
MATT: So. What's the plan?

2220
01:54:32,738 --> 01:54:39,538
SAM: We have no plan. So let's just walk right up.
I take, me and Keyleth take tip of the spear,

2221
01:54:39,538 --> 01:54:42,114
and we just walk right up to the base of the
tree.

2222
01:54:42,114 --> 01:54:43,327
LAURA: I float on my broom.

2223
01:54:43,327 --> 01:54:45,856
MATT: Okay, so. What's the marching order?

2224
01:54:45,856 --> 01:54:47,476
SAM: Scanlan and Keyleth first.

2225
01:54:47,476 --> 01:54:48,805
MATT: Scanlan and Keyleth at the front.

2226
01:54:48,805 --> 01:54:50,261
LAURA: Oh no, oh no.

2227
01:54:50,261 --> 01:54:51,344
MATT: Who's after them?

2228
01:54:51,344 --> 01:54:52,337
TRAVIS: I'm in the middle.

2229
01:54:52,337 --> 01:54:54,001
MATT: All right, so Grog's up next.

2230
01:54:54,001 --> 01:54:55,444
LAURA: Trinket's behind Grog.

2231
01:54:55,444 --> 01:55:00,148
MATT: Trinket's behind Grog, all righty.
Percy? Vax? Are you guys holding up the rear?

2232
01:55:00,148 --> 01:55:01,654
TALIESIN: Yes.

2233
01:55:01,654 --> 01:55:02,838
MATT: And you're on the broom above.

2234
01:55:02,838 --> 01:55:04,082
LAURA: I'm on the broom, yes.

2235
01:55:04,082 --> 01:55:05,121
MATT: All right, got it.

2236
01:55:05,121 --> 01:55:07,447
LIAM: I actually think I want to tail Grog.

2237
01:55:07,447 --> 01:55:08,308
MATT: All right.

2238
01:55:08,308 --> 01:55:09,224
LIAM: Thank you.

2239
01:55:09,224 --> 01:55:10,413
TALIESIN: I'll take the rear, then.

2240
01:55:10,413 --> 01:55:14,246
MATT: All right, so Percy's at the rear,
Vax and Trinket are both right behind Grog as you

2241
01:55:14,246 --> 01:55:20,088
guys push forward. You touch down in the swamp,
the actual thickness of the morass, moving

2242
01:55:20,088 --> 01:55:22,864
forward very slowly with the swamp shoes.
Grog,

2243
01:55:22,864 --> 01:55:26,193
you get two steps before they break under
your weight.

2244
01:55:26,193 --> 01:55:27,373
TRAVIS: Good.

2245
01:55:27,373 --> 01:55:28,730
MARISHA: We tried.

2246
01:55:28,730 --> 01:55:30,315
TRAVIS: I take them off.

2247
01:55:30,315 --> 01:55:35,573
MATT: Okay. But the rest of you, it does help,
you are not sinking. Your progress is very slow,

2248
01:55:35,573 --> 01:55:39,706
slower than it was previously when you were
already at half-speed, but you aren't breaking the

2249
01:55:39,706 --> 01:55:44,235
surface of the actual substance. It is sticky,
and you have to pull it forth, and it is tension

2250
01:55:44,235 --> 01:55:48,379
put on the ropes, but for the most part,
most of you are light of foot, and it's not a

2251
01:55:48,379 --> 01:55:56,213
huge issue. Except for you. Trinket's just up to
his elbows, just (sloshing) through the water.

2252
01:55:56,213 --> 01:55:57,564
LAURA: Does he look miserable?

2253
01:55:57,564 --> 01:55:59,009
MATT: He's not enjoying himself.

2254
01:55:59,009 --> 01:56:01,326
LAURA: Do you wanna go in the crystal? Okay.

2255
01:56:01,326 --> 01:56:03,053
MATT: And he just keeps pushing forward.

2256
01:56:03,053 --> 01:56:04,932
LIAM: All right, I'm scritching his ears while we
walk.

2257
01:56:04,932 --> 01:56:07,473
LAURA: Thank you.

2258
01:56:07,473 --> 01:56:12,658
MATT: You push onward. It's not too far of a
distance, it takes you ten or fifteen minutes to

2259
01:56:12,658 --> 01:56:19,228
reach the very base of the tree where you had
previously scoped out. The large roots climb up

2260
01:56:19,228 --> 01:56:25,940
ten, 12 feet before emerging from the base of this
large tree. Maybe, at this point you can look at

2261
01:56:25,940 --> 01:56:33,220
it now, taller than you thought at a distance.
It's roughly 80 to 100 feet in width and probably

2262
01:56:33,220 --> 01:56:38,742
over 150 to 200 feet tall. It is just a thick,
solid, giant tree.

2263
01:56:38,742 --> 01:56:41,271
LAURA: That is a huge-ass tree.

2264
01:56:41,271 --> 01:56:48,787
SAM: As we approach, I take a little muck and I'm
going to draw like a little tree on my forehead

2265
01:56:48,787 --> 01:56:53,282
and one on Keyleth's forehead as well.

2266
01:56:53,282 --> 01:56:54,781
MARISHA: What are you drawing?

2267
01:56:54,781 --> 01:56:56,663
SAM: Just like a little mud tree on your
forehead.

2268
01:56:56,663 --> 01:56:57,541
MARISHA: Oh, yeah.

2269
01:56:57,541 --> 01:56:59,193
LIAM: Not a penis at all.

2270
01:56:59,193 --> 01:57:00,949
LAURA: Oh, yeah.

2271
01:57:00,949 --> 01:57:02,590
MARISHA: How is my tree?

2272
01:57:02,590 --> 01:57:04,238
LAURA: Looks kind of like a dick.

2273
01:57:04,238 --> 01:57:05,368
MARISHA: Scanlan!

2274
01:57:05,368 --> 01:57:07,545
SAM: Don't worry. It's for a good cause.

2275
01:57:07,545 --> 01:57:14,381
MATT: You step up to the heavy roots there,
and the mass of vines that are all clustered and

2276
01:57:14,381 --> 01:57:17,960
matted together. What do you do?

2277
01:57:17,960 --> 01:57:19,400
TRAVIS: We fan out.

2278
01:57:19,400 --> 01:57:21,224
SAM: Just a little bit.

2279
01:57:21,224 --> 01:57:23,210
LAURA: Yeah, we kind of branch, we just spread out
a little bit.

2280
01:57:23,210 --> 01:57:25,189
MATT: All right, so you guys spread out a little
bit.

2281
01:57:25,189 --> 01:57:26,668
MARISHA: Are we trying to talk to it first?

2282
01:57:26,668 --> 01:57:30,131
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, talk to it. Be charming.

2283
01:57:30,131 --> 01:57:43,153
SAM: I call out to it. Sondur! Sondur, hear us! We
are your devotees! We have come to pay homage and

2284
01:57:43,153 --> 01:57:48,738
respect to you. We follow your ways and your
teachings.

2285
01:57:48,738 --> 01:57:54,233
MARISHA: And I make myself to look like the
tree-dick on my forehead.

2286
01:57:54,233 --> 01:57:59,260
SAM: We wear your mark on our heads to show
respect.

2287
01:57:59,260 --> 01:58:07,258
Please show us your power and grant us
your blessings.

2288
01:58:07,258 --> 01:58:16,136
MATT: Long absence of sound following your
statement. Couple of small vines as part of that

2289
01:58:16,136 --> 01:58:20,725
knotted mess kind of twist tighter and then relax.

2290
01:58:20,725 --> 01:58:23,644
Does not appear to be any sort of reaction beyond
that.

2291
01:58:23,644 --> 01:58:25,231
MARISHA: I cast Speak with Plants.

2292
01:58:25,231 --> 01:58:25,974
SAM: Okay.

2293
01:58:25,974 --> 01:58:27,277
MATT: All right.

2294
01:58:27,277 --> 01:58:33,130
LAURA: Just repeat--

2295
01:58:33,130 --> 01:58:35,370
MARISHA: Are you waiting for me?

2296
01:58:35,370 --> 01:58:39,906
MATT: You imbue plants within 30 feet of you with
limited sentience and animation, giving them the

2297
01:58:39,906 --> 01:58:45,158
ability to communicate with you and to follow your
simple commands.

2298
01:58:45,158 --> 01:58:50,504
MARISHA: Sondur. Can you hear me?

2299
01:58:50,504 --> 01:58:53,354
SAM: Question one.

2300
01:58:53,354 --> 01:58:59,322
MATT: There is no response.

2301
01:58:59,322 --> 01:59:10,815
MARISHA: I am Keyleth from the Air Ashari.
Druids of the prime realm.

2302
01:59:10,815 --> 01:59:15,403
Are you still present?

2303
01:59:15,403 --> 01:59:25,668
MATT: This low, cracking, creaking sound of heavy
wood on wood-fall begins to slowly emerge in your

2304
01:59:25,668 --> 01:59:27,985
head. It just says,

2305
01:59:27,985 --> 01:59:35,543
"I am here."

2306
01:59:35,543 --> 01:59:37,873
MARISHA: We would like to see your heart.

2307
01:59:37,873 --> 01:59:39,083
LAURA: What?

2308
01:59:39,083 --> 01:59:40,161
SAM: Wow. Straight to it.

2309
01:59:40,161 --> 01:59:41,567
LAURA: Just straight-up. Just right in.

2310
01:59:41,567 --> 01:59:45,752
SAM: Just straight to it. Just go straight for...
I wanna spend the night with you.

2311
01:59:45,752 --> 01:59:47,233
Just straight there.

2312
01:59:47,233 --> 01:59:54,045
MATT: There's a pause. You hear, (snapping
sounds), and you notice the vines, some are

2313
01:59:54,045 --> 01:59:58,358
pulling and snapping while others begin to slowly
pull apart.

2314
01:59:58,358 --> 02:00:03,525
That giant mass of vines that are clustered
between two of the large roots that merge with the

2315
02:00:03,738 --> 02:00:11,788
tree? Begin to untangle and fall free, revealing
what appears to be a slowly opening pathway into

2316
02:00:11,788 --> 02:00:20,237
the tree itself. You now see what looks to be
about four and a half feet tall and about three

2317
02:00:20,237 --> 02:00:25,148
feet wide, a tunnel, like a crack in the bark
itself,

2318
02:00:25,148 --> 02:00:27,733
that disappears into darkness deeper into 
the tree.

2319
02:00:27,733 --> 02:00:28,937
LAURA: No.

2320
02:00:28,937 --> 02:00:33,954
MARISHA: Me and my fellow companions are coming
in.

2321
02:00:33,954 --> 02:00:35,653
LAURA: No, this is so stupid.

2322
02:00:35,653 --> 02:00:37,036
SAM: Coming in?

2323
02:00:37,036 --> 02:00:37,707
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2324
02:00:37,707 --> 02:00:38,769
SAM: All right.

2325
02:00:38,769 --> 02:00:39,617
TRAVIS: Wait, how big is it?

2326
02:00:39,617 --> 02:00:40,712
MARISHA: I go in first.

2327
02:00:40,712 --> 02:00:41,464
SAM: Wait, you're going in?

2328
02:00:41,464 --> 02:00:42,553
LAURA: What, you're just going in?

2329
02:00:42,553 --> 02:00:43,312
SAM: Going with Kiki.

2330
02:00:43,312 --> 02:00:44,118
TALIESIN: Going in.

2331
02:00:44,118 --> 02:00:45,554
TRAVIS: You said four and a half feet...

2332
02:00:45,554 --> 02:00:47,284
MATT: Four and a half feet tall, about three feet
wide.

2333
02:00:47,284 --> 02:00:48,708
LAURA: So we can all fit in.

2334
02:00:48,708 --> 02:00:50,637
MATT: Well, you're gonna have to practically crawl
to get in there, Grog.

2335
02:00:50,637 --> 02:00:51,555
TRAVIS: Not this guy.

2336
02:00:51,555 --> 02:00:52,502
LAURA: You can fit in there.

2337
02:00:52,502 --> 02:00:53,515
MATT: You can fit, but you're gonna have to
crawl.

2338
02:00:53,515 --> 02:00:54,355
MARISHA: Just army crawl.

2339
02:00:54,355 --> 02:00:55,559
LAURA: Can Trinket fit through?

2340
02:00:55,559 --> 02:00:56,872
LIAM: It's gonna be a squeaker.

2341
02:00:56,872 --> 02:01:00,133
MATT: Trinket's gonna have to get down and like--

2342
02:01:00,133 --> 02:01:01,117
SAM: Your Pokeball.

2343
02:01:01,117 --> 02:01:03,570
LAURA: I know, I can just put him in the crystal
and then--

2344
02:01:03,570 --> 02:01:04,614
MATT: You can do that too, yeah.

2345
02:01:04,614 --> 02:01:05,571
LAURA: I'll put him in the crystal.

2346
02:01:05,571 --> 02:01:08,072
MATT: Okay. Trinket into the Raven's Slumber.

2347
02:01:08,072 --> 02:01:08,890
SAM: Do you want to stay outside?

2348
02:01:08,890 --> 02:01:10,198
LAURA: Grog, you can do it.

2349
02:01:10,198 --> 02:01:11,393
TRAVIS: Not normally.

2350
02:01:11,393 --> 02:01:12,609
LAURA: Turn your shoulders.

2351
02:01:12,609 --> 02:01:14,314
TALIESIN: (chicken noises)

2352
02:01:14,314 --> 02:01:19,699
LIAM: Could you pour some Crisco out of that magic
jug of yours and lube up?

2353
02:01:19,699 --> 02:01:21,223
LAURA: Yeah, oil yourself up, real good.

2354
02:01:21,223 --> 02:01:22,828
MATT: Just Winnie the Pooh you through?

2355
02:01:22,828 --> 02:01:25,581
SAM: Mayonnaise. Mayonnaise is slippery. Butter.

2356
02:01:25,581 --> 02:01:27,527
LIAM: This is Sparta. Come on.

2357
02:01:27,527 --> 02:01:28,667
TRAVIS: I'm going in, I'm going in.

2358
02:01:28,667 --> 02:01:30,275
MATT: Oh, bother.

2359
02:01:30,275 --> 02:01:30,880
LAURA: Oh, bother.

2360
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:33,035
MATT: I don't know why he's British suddenly.
All right, so, marching order.

2361
02:01:33,035 --> 02:01:34,106
Who's going in first?

2362
02:01:34,106 --> 02:01:34,876
MARISHA: Me.

2363
02:01:34,876 --> 02:01:35,559
MATT: Keyleth.

2364
02:01:35,559 --> 02:01:36,336
SAM: And me second.

2365
02:01:36,336 --> 02:01:37,867
MATT: And Scanlan, who's going in after them?

2366
02:01:37,867 --> 02:01:38,735
LIAM: I am.

2367
02:01:38,735 --> 02:01:40,008
LAURA: Then me, behind him.

2368
02:01:40,008 --> 02:01:41,543
MATT: Vax, Vex.

2369
02:01:41,543 --> 02:01:42,586
TALIESIN: Then me.

2370
02:01:42,586 --> 02:01:44,749
MATT: Percy. And then finally Grog.

2371
02:01:44,749 --> 02:01:47,352
LAURA: Grog!

2372
02:01:47,352 --> 02:01:48,264
MATT: All right.

2373
02:01:48,264 --> 02:01:49,936
MARISHA: Bringing up the rear this time, Grog.

2374
02:01:49,936 --> 02:01:51,584
MATT: So.

2375
02:01:51,584 --> 02:01:54,742
LIAM: Here comes the general.

2376
02:01:54,742 --> 02:01:57,830
MATT: As you begin to make your way into this
entrance to the tree--

2377
02:01:57,830 --> 02:02:00,037
LAURA: Oh no. We are so dumb.

2378
02:02:00,037 --> 02:02:04,704
MATT: This scent catches you as soon as you step
five, ten feet into the darkness.

2379
02:02:04,704 --> 02:02:06,457
LAURA: It smells like fart?

2380
02:02:06,457 --> 02:02:17,141
MATT: It's metallic, iron-like. Sharp, acrid,
uninviting. As you step inside and your hand

2381
02:02:17,141 --> 02:02:26,101
touches the inside of the entranceway, Keyleth,
as soon as your fingers make contact with the

2382
02:02:26,101 --> 02:02:30,572
slick wood, there's an image that flashes in your
head.

2383
02:02:30,572 --> 02:02:31,754
LAURA: Oh, god.

2384
02:02:31,754 --> 02:02:33,984
SAM: The whispers, the whispers.

2385
02:02:33,984 --> 02:02:36,141
LAURA: Oh no.

2386
02:02:36,141 --> 02:02:37,203
SAM: Oh my gosh.

2387
02:02:37,203 --> 02:02:40,551
LAURA: Don't hit that.

2388
02:02:40,551 --> 02:02:41,856
MARISHA: Watch the--

2389
02:02:41,856 --> 02:02:43,264
LAURA: That would be so bad.

2390
02:02:43,264 --> 02:02:44,647
SAM: Oh boy.

2391
02:02:44,647 --> 02:02:46,449
LAURA: I'm gonna smack his ass right now. Whack!

2392
02:02:46,449 --> 02:02:49,054
SAM: Ordinarily I would plug Lootcrate right here,
but this is too tense.

2393
02:02:49,054 --> 02:02:50,199
MARISHA: Wait wait wait.

2394
02:02:50,199 --> 02:02:53,304
TALIESIN: Way too tense to talk about all the
great things Lootcrate will send you every month.

2395
02:02:53,304 --> 02:02:57,220
SAM: Way too tense, yeah, I'm too nervous to
remember the three-dollar-a-month discount that

2396
02:02:57,220 --> 02:02:58,776
you would get by signing up--

2397
02:02:58,776 --> 02:03:01,586
TRAVIS: That's Lootcrate.com/crates.

2398
02:03:01,586 --> 02:03:04,468
LAURA: No, it's /criticalrole. And it'll take you
to crates.

2399
02:03:04,468 --> 02:03:12,249
TALIESIN: Crates will just show you everything
they have.

2400
02:03:12,249 --> 02:03:13,835
MARISHA: We're not alone.

2401
02:03:13,835 --> 02:03:15,066
SAM: What do you mean?

2402
02:03:15,066 --> 02:03:16,014
LAURA: What do you mean?

2403
02:03:16,014 --> 02:03:17,840
SAM: There's creatures?

2404
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:19,304
MARISHA: He's watching us.

2405
02:03:19,304 --> 02:03:20,646
SAM: Who?

2406
02:03:20,646 --> 02:03:22,084
LAURA: Sondur.

2407
02:03:22,084 --> 02:03:27,756
MATT: As you're saying this, your hand's following
the side, and it opens up again. You only have

2408
02:03:27,756 --> 02:03:34,982
about five feet of walking before this tiny tunnel
opens up into an interior chamber.

2409
02:03:34,982 --> 02:03:39,259
TRAVIS: Well, I hope he's watching. We just
crawled in his tree anus.

2410
02:03:39,259 --> 02:03:40,637
MATT: His tranus?

2411
02:03:40,637 --> 02:03:42,063
(All laugh.)

2412
02:03:42,063 --> 02:03:46,591
SAM: Ah, Matt.

2413
02:03:46,591 --> 02:03:51,827
LIAM: Bad DM.

2414
02:03:51,827 --> 02:03:58,084
MARISHA: Sondur. Is this you leading us straight
to you?

2415
02:03:58,084 --> 02:04:02,181
MATT: Nothing.

2416
02:04:02,181 --> 02:04:04,189
TRAVIS: How about we hit the wall?

2417
02:04:04,189 --> 02:04:06,685
LAURA: No! We're trapped in the tree.

2418
02:04:06,685 --> 02:04:13,821
SAM: I will, I'll try one more time and just say,
Sondur, we are... Sondurites, here to pay homage

2419
02:04:13,821 --> 02:04:20,507
to you. Please, show yourself and make us feel
your presence.

2420
02:04:20,507 --> 02:04:22,485
MATT: Are you guys still entering, or have you
stopped?

2421
02:04:22,485 --> 02:04:24,588
LAURA: (sings) Oh, Sondur... (stops singing) We're
walking forward, we're walking forward.

2422
02:04:24,588 --> 02:04:25,966
MATT: Because some of you are still outside of the
tree.

2423
02:04:25,966 --> 02:04:26,738
TALIESIN: Still going in.

2424
02:04:26,738 --> 02:04:28,583
MATT: Okay. So you all eventually make your way
inside this space.

2425
02:04:28,583 --> 02:04:32,129
MARISHA: I look at Scanlan and wipe the tree-dick
off my forehead.

2426
02:04:32,129 --> 02:04:33,667
MATT: Okay, it's pitch-black in here, by the way.

2427
02:04:33,667 --> 02:04:34,946
SAM: (whispering) It's our sign!

2428
02:04:34,946 --> 02:04:39,858
MATT: Percy, you see nothing. The rest of you have
some semblance of dark-vision here, so you can

2429
02:04:39,858 --> 02:04:50,883
see, the interior here, it is wall-to-wall vines
and thick, heavy roots. You are definitely on the

2430
02:04:50,883 --> 02:04:59,005
inside of the tree, this portion of the giant
hollow chamber. You can see it kind of lifts up.

2431
02:04:59,005 --> 02:05:05,124
Entangled webs of these branches and
smaller, long-dead trees jutting out inside,

2432
02:05:05,124 --> 02:05:10,911
like actual smaller physical trees within the
large tree. As you all enter, the little bit of

2433
02:05:10,911 --> 02:05:16,708
light behind you, Grog? Begins to shrink,
and you look over your shoulder as the entrance

2434
02:05:16,708 --> 02:05:21,255
you came through slams closed and you are all left
in darkness.

2435
02:05:21,255 --> 02:05:22,721
LAURA: We're just stuck in a tree now.

2436
02:05:22,721 --> 02:05:24,821
TRAVIS: Well, he puckered up.

2437
02:05:24,821 --> 02:05:32,365
MATT: The smell gets stronger and stronger.
At that point, as Grog, you kind of pull your way

2438
02:05:32,365 --> 02:05:36,503
through, and you're all standing
shoulder-to-shoulder in this dark space,

2439
02:05:36,503 --> 02:05:42,234
this one singular tree root that's sticking up
from the center in two different places.

2440
02:05:42,234 --> 02:05:49,277
This thin, reedy voice begins to echo through,
sourceless around you, that says,

2441
02:05:49,277 --> 02:05:59,744
"I know you. The moment you touched my 
sickness, I knew you."

2442
02:05:59,744 --> 02:06:05,759
At this moment, small patches of fungal clusters

2443
02:06:05,759 --> 02:06:12,851
begin to illuminate in the room. Areas of the
vines and ground just spring to life, and this

2444
02:06:12,851 --> 02:06:19,943
dull blue glow begins to fill the room with very,
very low light. You can just make out shapes.

2445
02:06:19,943 --> 02:06:24,435
You can see that the vines are just very slowly
shifting around you. The walls are not still.

2446
02:06:24,499 --> 02:06:28,299
That little bit of movement you'd occasionally
catch on the outside of the tree, it is perpetual

2447
02:06:28,383 --> 02:06:35,988
inside here. It is this constant churning mass of
living tree. You look up, and you can see all the

2448
02:06:35,988 --> 02:06:41,751
branches come and mat together into this conical
ceiling, where a number of vines drip down and

2449
02:06:41,751 --> 02:06:50,849
just hang, hundreds of them. You see the vines are
slowly coalescing in the center of this upward

2450
02:06:50,849 --> 02:06:58,869
kind of pinnacle. Slithering one into the next
like a thousand slithering snakes.

2451
02:06:58,869 --> 02:07:00,753
A voice comes out again.

2452
02:07:00,753 --> 02:07:05,052
"Why do you come here, children of the
lost?

2453
02:07:05,052 --> 02:07:13,073
What purpose brings you to Sondur's madness and pain?"

2454
02:07:13,073 --> 02:07:16,742
LAURA: We've come to help you.

2455
02:07:16,742 --> 02:07:24,452
MATT: A mass in the ceiling separates ever so
slightly, and you watch as two feet descend from

2456
02:07:24,452 --> 02:07:33,271
this strange apex. You now see the feet are a full
creature, held aloft by connected tendrils of

2457
02:07:33,271 --> 02:07:41,522
black plant matter, emanating from the back and
shoulders, as it slowly descends from the ceiling.

2458
02:07:41,522 --> 02:07:50,361
A thin, elf-like individual, their body comprised
of hundreds of small plants, leaves, and thorns.

2459
02:07:50,361 --> 02:07:55,303
The only semblance of flesh you see across the
face is the nose, the eyes, and the mouth.

2460
02:07:55,303 --> 02:08:01,635
The rest of it just slowly giving way to a
similar nest of plant-like vines that completely

2461
02:08:01,635 --> 02:08:11,917
fill the exterior of this room. It slowly touches
down, its feet hitting the ground, and as it does,

2462
02:08:12,005 --> 02:08:18,153
the tendrils all detach and withdraw back into
the ceiling, leaving it there, arms to its side,

2463
02:08:18,153 --> 02:08:24,058
its head down. Its face comes up, its eyes
immediately open with this bright yellow glow that

2464
02:08:24,058 --> 02:08:30,847
kind of bathes you. You can see the form,
the edges of all of your allies now, even being

2465
02:08:30,847 --> 02:08:34,535
framed by this light that's just pouring forth
from its face.

2466
02:08:34,535 --> 02:08:36,837
LAURA: I bow.

2467
02:08:36,837 --> 02:08:39,130
LIAM: Follow suit.

2468
02:08:39,130 --> 02:08:41,562
SAM: Sure, I'll bow as well.

2469
02:08:41,562 --> 02:08:48,330
MATT: You all bow before this creature. Do you
bow? All right.

2470
02:08:48,330 --> 02:08:49,717
MARISHA: I stand as well.

2471
02:08:49,717 --> 02:08:51,270
MATT: All right.

2472
02:08:51,270 --> 02:08:59,187
"You all come here, but one of
you is the reason."

2473
02:08:59,187 --> 02:09:06,634
It looks straight towards you. The light focuses 
and narrows from his eyes.

2474
02:09:06,634 --> 02:09:26,889
"You. Sweet, broken Vex'ahlia. Unwanted daughter,
unproven ally. Selfish and cruel. You drive those

2475
02:09:26,889 --> 02:09:39,090
"whom you would call family into danger and death
for your own gain. I understand you."

2476
02:09:39,090 --> 02:09:45,737
There's a softness and sadness to the face as 
he takes one step in your direction.

2477
02:09:45,737 --> 02:09:55,340
"You are lost without
form. Without knowing who you are, child.

2478
02:09:55,340 --> 02:09:59,609
"You stand shattered by expectation.

2479
02:09:59,609 --> 02:10:09,018
"Presenting an illusion of confidence.
Behind it, you never left that bloodied girl,

2480
02:10:09,018 --> 02:10:22,259
"dagger in hand, body at your feet. You are a
killer, run as you may. The tears you cry are not

2481
02:10:22,259 --> 02:10:36,818
"in vain, my sweet, my dear Vex'ahlia. You can rise
above your trembling destiny. I have lived a

2482
02:10:36,818 --> 02:10:55,317
"thousand years and a day. I have seen many things.
I can grant many gifts."

2483
02:10:55,317 --> 02:10:57,875
LAURA: Are we still pretending to like this fuck?

2484
02:10:57,875 --> 02:10:59,084
SAM: Nope.

2485
02:10:59,084 --> 02:11:09,399
LAURA: I don't want anything you offer.

2486
02:11:09,399 --> 02:11:22,599
MATT: "You mistake. My intent is not to hurt,
but to understand. I see lots of my youth in you.

2487
02:11:22,599 --> 02:11:35,432
"We are not as different as you may think.
You have things I do not. Companionship.

2488
02:11:35,432 --> 02:11:52,622
"I have been without for so very long. And the
ones I have let in have hurt me so very deeply."

2489
02:11:52,622 --> 02:11:57,251
His eyes actually cast away from you for a
second and he steps back into place. Almost seems

2490
02:11:57,251 --> 02:12:05,758
to, his confident form withdraws into this almost
hanging, sad position.

2491
02:12:05,758 --> 02:12:09,999
LAURA: You've been betrayed.

2492
02:12:09,999 --> 02:12:12,903
MATT: We all have in some degree, yes.

2493
02:12:12,903 --> 02:12:16,859
LAURA: Is that why you are what you are now?

2494
02:12:16,859 --> 02:12:25,135
MATT: I don't even remember. I just know that I'm
alone and she left me there.

2495
02:12:25,135 --> 02:12:30,038
LAURA: She? Who is she?

2496
02:12:30,038 --> 02:12:48,452
MATT: Memories have faded. I just want someone to
understand me, that's all. Can you understand me?

2497
02:12:48,452 --> 02:13:02,218
LAURA: Sondur. I understand.

2498
02:13:02,218 --> 02:13:10,370
MATT: "Is there trust in you?"

2499
02:13:10,370 --> 02:13:18,124
His form steps forward once more, his head tilted,
looking at you curiously.

2500
02:13:18,124 --> 02:13:21,041
LAURA: You want to be loved.

2501
02:13:21,041 --> 02:13:39,664
MATT: I wish a bond. A companion once more.
Would you embrace me? Embrace your rebirth?

2502
02:13:39,664 --> 02:13:45,610
I could give you so much.

2503
02:13:45,610 --> 02:13:54,720
LIAM: Vex'ahlia.

2504
02:13:54,720 --> 02:14:02,205
MATT: I could give you the means to protect them.
Your home.

2505
02:14:02,205 --> 02:14:07,505
LAURA: What would you ask in return?

2506
02:14:07,505 --> 02:14:12,677
MATT: Your heart.

2507
02:14:12,677 --> 02:14:18,757
LAURA: My heart is someone else's. And I pull my
bow.

2508
02:14:18,757 --> 02:14:25,873
MATT: He withdraws a moment. The tendrils whip out
again and connect into his back,

2509
02:14:25,873 --> 02:14:30,405
and he's pulled aloft, back, further in.

2510
02:14:30,405 --> 02:14:43,670
"All I ask is one who
knows my pain. What is your answer?"

2511
02:14:43,670 --> 02:14:46,128
LAURA: I release the arrow.

2512
02:14:46,128 --> 02:14:48,886
MATT: Roll an attack.

2513
02:14:48,886 --> 02:14:51,465
LAURA: I'm sorry, I feel so guilty about it!

2514
02:14:51,465 --> 02:14:53,083
MATT: Roll an attack.

2515
02:14:53,083 --> 02:14:56,612
SAM: He just wanted a kiss and you shot him!

2516
02:14:56,612 --> 02:14:58,187
MARISHA: He's a dick.

2517
02:14:58,187 --> 02:14:59,549
LAURA: 25.

2518
02:14:59,549 --> 02:15:05,419
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll damage.

2519
02:15:05,419 --> 02:15:08,219
SAM: Just a lonely guy.

2520
02:15:08,219 --> 02:15:10,188
LAURA: 16.

2521
02:15:10,188 --> 02:15:11,705
TALIESIN: I have no respect for anyone who says
we're not so different.

2522
02:15:11,705 --> 02:15:14,257
MATT: 16 points of piercing damage.

2523
02:15:14,257 --> 02:15:17,761
LIAM: And shitting black diarrhea out of the
tree.

2524
02:15:17,761 --> 02:15:24,832
MATT: As the arrow hits his form as he's being
pulled up-- (gasps)-- you hear the air escape like

2525
02:15:24,832 --> 02:15:32,663
he had the wind knocked out of him. His glowing
yellow eyes blink, blink, and his jaw kind of

2526
02:15:32,663 --> 02:15:44,219
hangs open. There in the low-lit darkness.
And you watch as more of that black, thick tar

2527
02:15:44,219 --> 02:15:50,837
just begins to pour from his mouth onto the
ground, splattering and seeping into the floor.

2528
02:15:50,837 --> 02:15:54,709
His jaw slowly closes.

2529
02:15:54,709 --> 02:15:59,514
"Then I am to be alone."

2530
02:15:59,514 --> 02:16:01,192
He reaches his hand up, and you watch--

2531
02:16:01,192 --> 02:16:02,244
MARISHA: Oh shit!

2532
02:16:02,244 --> 02:16:11,569
MATT: -- as these vines reveal and give to him
this large curved bow that he grasps in his hand.

2533
02:16:11,569 --> 02:16:16,760
The other vines curl around his body, and you can
see his form begin to build, like his actual body

2534
02:16:16,760 --> 02:16:22,852
begins to grow as the vines become part of him.
His face of flesh disappears behind an exterior

2535
02:16:22,852 --> 02:16:29,290
of dark and gnarled wood. The voice grows deep as
he all of a sudden withdraws into the side of the

2536
02:16:29,290 --> 02:16:37,260
tree itself, and then bursts forth, landing on the
ground. Not an elf-like entity, but some sort of

2537
02:16:37,260 --> 02:16:42,815
gnarled root-like tree creature, holding Fenthras
in one hand.

2538
02:16:42,815 --> 02:16:44,744
LAURA: Was that bad? Should I have not attacked
him?

2539
02:16:44,744 --> 02:16:45,747
SAM: You did great.

2540
02:16:45,747 --> 02:16:46,530
LAURA: Okay.

2541
02:16:46,530 --> 02:16:47,839
TALIESIN: No, no, he was being terrible.

2542
02:16:47,839 --> 02:16:48,767
LAURA: We should probably--

2543
02:16:48,767 --> 02:16:50,834
MATT: Your choice is made.

2544
02:16:50,834 --> 02:16:51,630
LAURA: I call out Trinket--

2545
02:16:51,630 --> 02:16:57,015
MATT: Become another memory here and keep me
company in oblivion.

2546
02:16:57,015 --> 02:17:01,091
SAM: Oh, god.

2547
02:17:01,091 --> 02:17:05,159
MATT: The two dead trees quake and begin to lift
up--

2548
02:17:05,159 --> 02:17:06,111
MARISHA: Oh, fuck.

2549
02:17:06,111 --> 02:17:08,324
MATT: -- from the sides of the tree. Everyone roll
initiative.

2550
02:17:08,324 --> 02:17:10,422
TALIESIN: Oh.

2551
02:17:10,422 --> 02:17:11,838
TRAVIS: Yeah!

2552
02:17:11,838 --> 02:17:13,432
LAURA: I feel so guilty.

2553
02:17:13,432 --> 02:17:14,778
MARISHA: No, he was a fucking cock.

2554
02:17:14,778 --> 02:17:16,113
LAURA: He was terrible, was it mean?

2555
02:17:16,113 --> 02:17:17,822
MARISHA: No, dude.

2556
02:17:17,822 --> 02:17:20,072
LAURA: Okay, we're in the tree, we're in the
tree.

2557
02:17:20,072 --> 02:17:22,184
MARISHA: Like you said, I don't trust anyone who
says we're alike, you and I.

2558
02:17:22,184 --> 02:17:24,730
SAM: What, were you gonna give him a hug and get
possessed forever?

2559
02:17:24,730 --> 02:17:26,603
LAURA: I know, he's offering terrible things,
right?

2560
02:17:26,603 --> 02:17:27,989
TALIESIN: He was a dick.

2561
02:17:27,989 --> 02:17:29,978
MARISHA: I also don't like anyone who tries to act
like

2562
02:17:29,978 --> 02:17:32,592
we didn't make our own choice to come in here.

2563
02:17:32,592 --> 02:17:35,457
TALIESIN: And for that matter, anybody who says
we're not so different,

2564
02:17:35,457 --> 02:17:37,446
that's usually a sign of a terrible person.

2565
02:17:37,446 --> 02:17:38,541
MARISHA: That we're totally different.

2566
02:17:38,541 --> 02:17:39,690
TALIESIN: Terrible person.

2567
02:17:39,690 --> 02:17:41,223
SAM: Because we're terrible people.

2568
02:17:41,223 --> 02:17:42,783
TALIESIN: Well, that's very fair.

2569
02:17:42,783 --> 02:17:44,279
LIAM: He's creeping on my sister, fuck him.

2570
02:17:44,279 --> 02:17:46,441
MARISHA: Yeah.

2571
02:17:46,441 --> 02:17:52,055
TALIESIN: I was only not shooting him to be
polite.

2572
02:17:52,055 --> 02:17:53,795
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

2573
02:17:53,795 --> 02:17:59,533
MATT: All right, so. 25 to 20, anybody?

2574
02:17:59,533 --> 02:18:00,778
TALIESIN: 21.

2575
02:18:00,778 --> 02:18:01,911
MATT: 21.

2576
02:18:01,911 --> 02:18:03,412
LIAM: 23.

2577
02:18:03,412 --> 02:18:06,820
MATT: Nice.

2578
02:18:06,820 --> 02:18:09,761
TRAVIS: Just so you know, your notepad is in the
upper-left.

2579
02:18:09,761 --> 02:18:11,299
LIAM: Secrets.

2580
02:18:11,299 --> 02:18:13,337
LAURA: (laughs) Scootch-scootch.

2581
02:18:13,337 --> 02:18:18,686
MATT: All right, and so. Vax, Percy, 21, er,
20 to 15?

2582
02:18:18,686 --> 02:18:19,712
TRAVIS: 18.

2583
02:18:19,712 --> 02:18:20,699
MARISHA: 15.

2584
02:18:20,699 --> 02:18:21,616
SAM: 15.

2585
02:18:21,616 --> 02:18:23,370
MATT: All righty.

2586
02:18:23,370 --> 02:18:37,508
LAURA: I got that one hit and that was all I got.
I'm sorry.

2587
02:18:37,508 --> 02:18:40,701
MATT: All right, and then...

2588
02:18:40,701 --> 02:18:41,886
LAURA: 14.

2589
02:18:41,886 --> 02:18:57,588
MATT: 14? Okay. All righty. So, top of the round,
Vax. You have first up.

2590
02:18:57,588 --> 02:18:59,649
You're currently over here.

2591
02:18:59,649 --> 02:19:03,153
LIAM: Yeah. I can see fuck-all through this
magical window--

2592
02:19:03,153 --> 02:19:04,412
MATT: I understand.

2593
02:19:04,412 --> 02:19:08,555
LIAM: So I see where I am in that circle,
what are the big clumps of poop in the middle?

2594
02:19:08,555 --> 02:19:13,187
MATT: This right here is part of the root that is
growing up in the center of this tree. There are

2595
02:19:13,187 --> 02:19:18,778
two trees on the side that are shifting,
and the actual large dark-rooted form that is now

2596
02:19:18,778 --> 02:19:22,042
Sondur is over here on the far side.

2597
02:19:22,042 --> 02:19:29,019
LIAM: All right, boots click, uh, I am hanging
back behind-- is Trinket out still?

2598
02:19:29,019 --> 02:19:31,744
LAURA: He's out. Oh. I haven't brought him out
yet, I haven't brought him out.

2599
02:19:31,744 --> 02:19:32,728
MATT: No.

2600
02:19:32,728 --> 02:19:35,027
LIAM: All right. Then I'm just leaning out from
behind Grog

2601
02:19:35,027 --> 02:19:38,153
and I am going to dagger-dagger-dagger him.

2602
02:19:38,153 --> 02:19:39,721
MATT: All righty, go for it.

2603
02:19:39,721 --> 02:19:42,145
LIAM: And I'm first to attack so I have
advantage.

2604
02:19:42,145 --> 02:19:44,097
MATT: You do.

2605
02:19:44,097 --> 02:19:46,305
LIAM: Okay, so the first hit is a 26.

2606
02:19:46,305 --> 02:19:48,703
MATT: 26 hits.

2607
02:19:48,703 --> 02:19:50,935
LIAM: Yeah, second is a 26.

2608
02:19:50,935 --> 02:19:52,459
MATT: Hits.

2609
02:19:52,459 --> 02:19:55,565
LIAM: And the third is a 21.

2610
02:19:55,565 --> 02:19:57,531
MATT: 21. All three hit.

2611
02:19:57,531 --> 02:19:59,446
LIAM: Okay, so the first one is sneak attack.

2612
02:19:59,446 --> 02:20:00,497
MATT: It is.

2613
02:20:00,497 --> 02:20:08,207
LIAM: This one is the flame-tongue, here it goes.
Six and seven,

2614
02:20:08,207 --> 02:20:10,369
here comes the sneak attack damage.

2615
02:20:10,369 --> 02:20:12,035
MATT: All the sneak attack damage!

2616
02:20:12,035 --> 02:20:13,154
LIAM: Say again?

2617
02:20:13,154 --> 02:20:15,608
MATT: Percy, you're up next, just so you're
aware.

2618
02:20:15,608 --> 02:20:22,333
LIAM: (mumbling) 30 for the first.

2619
02:20:22,333 --> 02:20:24,540
MATT: 30, nice.

2620
02:20:24,540 --> 02:20:33,520
LIAM: Seven for the second, and eight for the third.

2621
02:20:33,736 --> 02:20:38,571
MATT: Great, all right. You, tapping the boots,
rush out behind Grog, fling all three daggers,

2622
02:20:38,571 --> 02:20:47,144
all seem to stick into the wood-armored exterior
of Sondur's treant form. You see he kind of pulls

2623
02:20:47,144 --> 02:20:52,524
back a bit from the impact. Damage definitely has
been sustained unexpectedly.

2624
02:20:52,524 --> 02:20:54,943
LIAM: Where am I in relation to the party,
to my sister?

2625
02:20:54,943 --> 02:20:59,694
MATT: You're right there, your sister is right
there. So you're about 10 feet from her.

2626
02:20:59,694 --> 02:21:03,197
LIAM: I'm gonna just roll forward and crouch in
front of her low,

2627
02:21:03,197 --> 02:21:05,528
to give her a shot but be in
front of her.

2628
02:21:05,528 --> 02:21:08,751
MATT: All righty. There you go. All right,
that finishes your turn.

2629
02:21:08,751 --> 02:21:10,935
That brings us to Percy.

2630
02:21:10,935 --> 02:21:18,866
TALIESIN: I'm going to dart to the right and keep
about 10 to 15 feet distance away from the

2631
02:21:18,866 --> 02:21:22,440
exterior wall, because that looks creepy as fuck.

2632
02:21:22,440 --> 02:21:23,505
MATT: Okay.

2633
02:21:23,505 --> 02:21:27,073
TALIESIN: About there. First thing I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna pull out Bad News and I'm gonna take a

2634
02:21:27,073 --> 02:21:29,652
shot, and I'm gonna try and disarm him.

2635
02:21:29,652 --> 02:21:31,535
MATT: Okay.

2636
02:21:31,535 --> 02:21:36,980
TALIESIN: So. We'll see if that does anything.

2637
02:21:36,980 --> 02:21:38,321
Natural 20.

2638
02:21:38,321 --> 02:21:40,257
LAURA: Yes!

2639
02:21:40,257 --> 02:21:43,929
SAM: At least five a session.

2640
02:21:43,929 --> 02:21:46,215
LIAM: That loaded die was the best investment we
ever made.

2641
02:21:46,215 --> 02:21:49,596
TALIESIN: It was the best, it was such a
wonderful, wonderful--

2642
02:21:49,596 --> 02:21:51,152
SAM: Did a fan give that to you?

2643
02:21:51,152 --> 02:21:52,874
TALIESIN: A fan gave that to me, yes they did.

2644
02:21:52,874 --> 02:21:54,149
MATT: All right, natural 20.

2645
02:21:54,149 --> 02:22:00,673
TALIESIN: Natural 20, and that means I don't even
burn the grit for it, and that's arm-shot, so.

2646
02:22:00,673 --> 02:22:04,796
Strength saving throw against a DC 19.

2647
02:22:04,796 --> 02:22:08,588
MATT: That is 21, so yeah, it manages to maintain
it.

2648
02:22:08,588 --> 02:22:16,919
TALIESIN: Okay, so it maintains it. I forgot to
cast Hex, but god damn it. That's fine.

2649
02:22:16,919 --> 02:22:20,735
So, taking my shot...

2650
02:22:20,735 --> 02:22:22,431
MATT: Dice times two.

2651
02:22:22,431 --> 02:22:28,345
TALIESIN: That went well. That's 19 times two,
that's 38.

2652
02:22:28,345 --> 02:22:30,394
MATT: 38 points of damage.

2653
02:22:30,394 --> 02:22:32,279
TALIESIN: That's 44 points of damage.

2654
02:22:32,279 --> 02:22:34,340
MATT: 44 points of damage on the critical hit.

2655
02:22:34,340 --> 02:22:38,545
TALIESIN: Of piercing damage. I'm gonna reload.

2656
02:22:38,545 --> 02:22:39,672
MATT: All right.

2657
02:22:39,672 --> 02:22:41,841
TALIESIN: I'm gonna cast Hex.

2658
02:22:41,841 --> 02:22:45,708
MATT: The impact manages to hit part of the wood,
it splinters,

2659
02:22:45,708 --> 02:22:51,509
not doing as much damage as you'd
expect it would.

2660
02:22:51,509 --> 02:22:53,241
TALIESIN: That's fine.

2661
02:22:53,241 --> 02:22:56,638
MATT: It's still a nice hit, but the form seemed
to resist it--

2662
02:22:56,638 --> 02:23:00,925
TALIESIN: Seems to be taking it. That's fine.
I'm casting Hex.

2663
02:23:00,925 --> 02:23:02,044
MATT: All right.

2664
02:23:02,044 --> 02:23:09,314
TALIESIN: I'm giving him disadvantage on strength
saving throws.

2665
02:23:09,314 --> 02:23:10,976
MATT: All righty.

2666
02:23:10,976 --> 02:23:12,011
TALIESIN: I'm gonna take another shot--

2667
02:23:12,011 --> 02:23:13,687
MATT: Ability checks, not saving throws.

2668
02:23:13,687 --> 02:23:17,081
TALIESIN: Yeah, checks, excuse me. I'm gonna take
another shot at getting that damn bow out of his

2669
02:23:17,081 --> 02:23:31,829
hand. So we'll see if we can do that. Yeah,
that's a 19, so that's 32 to hit.

2670
02:23:31,829 --> 02:23:34,404
MATT: That hits.

2671
02:23:34,404 --> 02:23:37,449
TALIESIN: He can roll his saving throw.

2672
02:23:37,449 --> 02:23:41,610
MATT: 17, so no.

2673
02:23:41,610 --> 02:23:43,136
TALIESIN: So no, he drops the bow.

2674
02:23:43,136 --> 02:23:44,483
MATT: The bow gets dropped.

2675
02:23:44,483 --> 02:23:45,411
SAM: Oh, shit!

2676
02:23:45,411 --> 02:23:46,510
TALIESIN: Bow's on the ground.

2677
02:23:46,510 --> 02:23:50,814
MARISHA: Oh, bow's on the ground, bow's on the
ground.

2678
02:23:50,814 --> 02:23:58,055
TALIESIN: That's a terrible roll. That's okay.
So that's ten points of piercing damage and two

2679
02:23:58,055 --> 02:24:00,212
points of necrotic damage.

2680
02:24:00,212 --> 02:24:02,039
MATT: Okay.

2681
02:24:02,039 --> 02:24:03,956
SAM: How do you want to do this?

2682
02:24:03,956 --> 02:24:09,140
MATT: So you fire the second shot, does hit,
a little crack of impact, the wood on the

2683
02:24:09,140 --> 02:24:14,362
exterior splinters a bit, the necrotic hit does
still push through. All right, that finishes your

2684
02:24:14,362 --> 02:24:18,724
turn, as Fenthras gets blasted off, a finger's
actually missing from the impact.

2685
02:24:18,724 --> 02:24:21,030
A finger begins to grow back.

2686
02:24:21,030 --> 02:24:22,922
TALIESIN: Bow's on the ground!

2687
02:24:22,922 --> 02:24:26,841
MATT: All right, Grog. Actually, no, before you're
up, we're at count 20. All right.

2688
02:24:26,841 --> 02:24:28,217
SAM: Count 20.

2689
02:24:28,217 --> 02:24:29,424
LAURA: What's that mean?

2690
02:24:29,424 --> 02:24:30,887
MARISHA: What does that mean?

2691
02:24:30,887 --> 02:24:33,326
MATT: So. Suddenly the ground quakes for a second,
part of the roots expand--

2692
02:24:33,326 --> 02:24:35,210
TALIESIN: Oh, shit.

2693
02:24:35,210 --> 02:24:36,043
SAM: Lair actions.

2694
02:24:36,043 --> 02:24:41,323
MATT: -- and a cloud of gas begins to fill a small
area about that big.

2695
02:24:41,323 --> 02:24:42,857
LAURA: Oh, of course.

2696
02:24:42,857 --> 02:24:48,042
MATT: I need Scanlan, Keyleth, Vax, and Vex to
make a constitution saving throw.

2697
02:24:48,042 --> 02:24:49,544
MARISHA: Where's that dice?

2698
02:24:49,544 --> 02:24:51,110
LIAM: Oh, that's our specialty.

2699
02:24:51,110 --> 02:24:52,602
MARISHA: Yeah, right? Not bad.

2700
02:24:52,602 --> 02:24:54,143
LAURA: Oh, natural 20!

2701
02:24:54,143 --> 02:24:55,334
MATT: Nice.

2702
02:24:55,334 --> 02:24:57,935
LIAM: I'm gonna burn a Luck. 16.

2703
02:24:57,935 --> 02:24:59,342
MATT: All right.

2704
02:24:59,342 --> 02:25:00,900
MARISHA: 20 total, 20 total.

2705
02:25:00,900 --> 02:25:02,687
SAM: 20 total.

2706
02:25:02,687 --> 02:25:04,978
MATT: Okay.

2707
02:25:04,978 --> 02:25:06,527
(All laugh.)

2708
02:25:06,527 --> 02:25:07,719
MATT: All of you guys manage to just in time--

2709
02:25:07,719 --> 02:25:08,772
TRAVIS: He's pissed.

2710
02:25:08,772 --> 02:25:13,253
MATT: -- catch your breath and keep below the
poison cloud as it dissipates in the vicinity of

2711
02:25:13,253 --> 02:25:23,389
you, so you reduce the damage to each of you guys
to be

2712
02:25:23,389 --> 02:25:25,906
12 points of poison damage to all of you guys.

2713
02:25:25,906 --> 02:25:30,843
MARISHA: Damn. That's half.

2714
02:25:30,843 --> 02:25:35,117
MATT: So that's 12 points of poison damage to each
one of you guys. Now, Grog, it's your turn.

2715
02:25:35,117 --> 02:25:38,648
TRAVIS: I would like to advance-- I would like to
rage.

2716
02:25:38,648 --> 02:25:40,006
MATT: All right.

2717
02:25:40,006 --> 02:25:48,350
TRAVIS: I would like to advance as far as I can
get towards the treant.

2718
02:25:48,350 --> 02:25:50,771
MATT: You can get right there, you're not quite
close enough to hit.

2719
02:25:50,771 --> 02:25:55,517
TRAVIS: Hey, that's cool, and I'm gonna use the
chain of returning with the blood axe, and I'm

2720
02:25:55,517 --> 02:25:57,535
gonna throw it at the tree.

2721
02:25:57,535 --> 02:25:58,621
MATT: All right.

2722
02:25:58,621 --> 02:26:00,721
TRAVIS: At Sondur.

2723
02:26:00,721 --> 02:26:05,572
MATT: Go for it.

2724
02:26:05,572 --> 02:26:10,174
TRAVIS: That's not great. Oh! 20 total.

2725
02:26:10,174 --> 02:26:12,231
MATT: 20 total? All righty.

2726
02:26:12,231 --> 02:26:14,466
(background music becomes distorted)

2727
02:26:14,466 --> 02:26:16,703
LAURA: Oh no. We gotta get a new cable, a new
cable for you.

2728
02:26:16,703 --> 02:26:17,972
SAM: It's dying.

2729
02:26:17,972 --> 02:26:19,915
MATT: I know, I have a new iPad coming, actually.

2730
02:26:19,915 --> 02:26:20,815
LAURA: Oh, okay.

2731
02:26:20,815 --> 02:26:23,284
MATT: It's in the budget, having issues,
strangely. Which is a shame, because this works

2732
02:26:23,284 --> 02:26:25,758
really well for this battle. I dunno. Maybe.

2733
02:26:25,758 --> 02:26:27,092
SAM: Music help!

2734
02:26:27,092 --> 02:26:28,233
MATT: I'll try.

2735
02:26:28,233 --> 02:26:30,188
MARISHA: Oh, that got so awkwardly quiet.

2736
02:26:30,188 --> 02:26:32,377
LAURA: Oh no, it's all...

2737
02:26:32,377 --> 02:26:34,692
MATT: Yeah, I don't wanna tear it. Whatever,
it's fine, it's fine.

2738
02:26:34,692 --> 02:26:37,590
MARISHA: It just sounds weird inside the tree...

2739
02:26:37,590 --> 02:26:38,640
TALIESIN: Acoustics.

2740
02:26:38,640 --> 02:26:39,497
MARISHA: Acoustics.

2741
02:26:39,497 --> 02:26:41,955
SAM: If anyone works for Apple and wants to send
us all new iPads.

2742
02:26:41,955 --> 02:26:43,237
(All laugh.)

2743
02:26:43,237 --> 02:26:46,422
TALIESIN: iPhones. iPad Pros.

2744
02:26:46,422 --> 02:26:48,092
MARISHA: Preferably in rose gold.

2745
02:26:48,092 --> 02:26:50,107
(The music comes back in, less distorted.)

2746
02:26:50,107 --> 02:26:51,453
SAM: Better? Better!

2747
02:26:51,453 --> 02:26:52,594
LAURA: That sounds better.

2748
02:26:52,594 --> 02:26:53,648
MATT: It's working better.

2749
02:26:53,648 --> 02:26:55,547
MARISHA: Yes, much better. Much better.

2750
02:26:55,547 --> 02:26:56,219
LAURA: Yeah.

2751
02:26:56,219 --> 02:26:57,011
MARISHA: You're good.

2752
02:26:57,011 --> 02:26:58,102
MATT: Okay, cool. We're good.

2753
02:26:58,102 --> 02:26:59,599
SAM: Forget those iPads.

2754
02:26:59,599 --> 02:27:01,609
MATT: So, Grog, what was your attack roll?

2755
02:27:01,609 --> 02:27:02,861
TRAVIS: It was a 20 total.

2756
02:27:02,861 --> 02:27:08,114
MATT: That does just barely hit. Go ahead and roll
damage.

2757
02:27:08,114 --> 02:27:10,566
TRAVIS: 24.

2758
02:27:10,566 --> 02:27:11,648
MATT: 24 points--

2759
02:27:11,648 --> 02:27:15,950
TRAVIS: Ahh, plus... four points of necrotic
damage, for 28.

2760
02:27:15,950 --> 02:27:22,722
MATT: 28 points of damage. The axe, with all your
heaving might behind it, travels the ten feet to

2761
02:27:22,722 --> 02:27:30,190
slam into the chest of Sondur. Reaches up and
tries to grab it, smashing it between his hands to

2762
02:27:30,190 --> 02:27:37,122
hold it there. Go ahead and make your strength to
pull it back.

2763
02:27:37,122 --> 02:27:38,569
TRAVIS: 18.

2764
02:27:38,569 --> 02:27:41,721
MATT: 18, yeah, that works fine, okay.

2765
02:27:41,721 --> 02:27:44,875
MARISHA: It appeared he took damage from the
necrotic?

2766
02:27:44,875 --> 02:27:46,709
MATT: Yeah, he did.

2767
02:27:46,709 --> 02:27:48,511
TRAVIS: On Percy's and mine.

2768
02:27:48,511 --> 02:27:49,412
MATT: Yeah.

2769
02:27:49,412 --> 02:27:50,892
MARISHA: So he can take necrotic damage.

2770
02:27:50,892 --> 02:27:51,826
TALIESIN: Apparently he can.

2771
02:27:51,826 --> 02:27:53,120
LAURA: That's good, that's good.

2772
02:27:53,120 --> 02:27:54,563
MARISHA: Good to know.

2773
02:27:54,563 --> 02:27:56,816
MATT: But not as impacting on the necrotic damage
as much as you'd hoped.

2774
02:27:56,816 --> 02:27:57,694
LAURA: Oh, okay.

2775
02:27:57,694 --> 02:27:58,807
MARISHA: On the necrotic damage.

2776
02:27:58,807 --> 02:28:00,594
TRAVIS: But Liam did, I mean, Vax did something.

2777
02:28:00,594 --> 02:28:02,513
MATT: Yeah, you guys have all done damage to him,
it was just

2778
02:28:02,513 --> 02:28:04,433
generally lesser than you hoped it would be.

2779
02:28:04,433 --> 02:28:06,157
TRAVIS: Yeah, yours was surprisingly good.

2780
02:28:06,157 --> 02:28:07,245
LAURA: Piercing damage...

2781
02:28:07,245 --> 02:28:09,685
MATT: Well, his just, he just sneak attacked.

2782
02:28:09,685 --> 02:28:11,003
TALIESIN: We haven't found a winner.

2783
02:28:11,003 --> 02:28:11,800
LAURA: Okay.

2784
02:28:11,800 --> 02:28:12,639
LIAM: Sneak-attack damage.

2785
02:28:12,639 --> 02:28:14,920
TALIESIN: We haven't found a winner, we've just
been hitting him really god damned hard.

2786
02:28:14,920 --> 02:28:18,718
MATT: But anyway. So you pull the axe back,
grab it from the chain, it's back in your grip,

2787
02:28:18,718 --> 02:28:20,957
you're fine, you're good to go. Does that end
your turn?

2788
02:28:20,957 --> 02:28:22,112
TRAVIS: That does.

2789
02:28:22,112 --> 02:28:24,993
MATT: All right, at the end of your turn,
he's gonna go ahead and burn two legendary

2790
02:28:24,993 --> 02:28:29,732
actions to cast a spell.

2791
02:28:29,732 --> 02:28:34,726
LAURA: Oh no! He's like a dragon!

2792
02:28:34,726 --> 02:28:37,721
MATT: All right. I need-- (laughs)

2793
02:28:37,721 --> 02:28:39,734
LAURA: I should've just gone evil.

2794
02:28:39,734 --> 02:28:45,945
MATT: I need everyone, all of you, to make a
dexterity saving throw.

2795
02:28:45,945 --> 02:28:47,744
SAM: Is he casting a spell?

2796
02:28:47,744 --> 02:28:48,978
MATT: He is, yes.

2797
02:28:48,978 --> 02:28:50,821
SAM: I will attempt to Counterspell it.

2798
02:28:50,821 --> 02:28:55,908
MATT: Okay. All right, go ahead and make your d20
plus six.

2799
02:28:55,908 --> 02:28:57,864
SAM: I'm gonna go at level five.

2800
02:28:57,864 --> 02:28:59,018
MATT: Okay.

2801
02:28:59,018 --> 02:29:02,438
SAM: Level five. What do I, d20 plus six?

2802
02:29:02,438 --> 02:29:05,697
MATT: Correct.

2803
02:29:05,697 --> 02:29:06,743
SAM: 24.

2804
02:29:06,743 --> 02:29:07,709
MATT: 24?

2805
02:29:07,709 --> 02:29:08,652
SAM: Yeah.

2806
02:29:08,652 --> 02:29:09,579
MATT: All right.

2807
02:29:09,579 --> 02:29:10,312
MARISHA: Hell yeah.

2808
02:29:10,312 --> 02:29:13,926
MATT: He goes to create this spell, and suddenly
it fizzles in midair,

2809
02:29:13,926 --> 02:29:15,934
unable to actually take effect.

2810
02:29:15,934 --> 02:29:17,245
(Sam rings a bell.)

2811
02:29:17,245 --> 02:29:18,464
MARISHA: Hell yeah, Scanlan! Hell yeah.

2812
02:29:18,464 --> 02:29:19,938
(All laugh.)

2813
02:29:19,938 --> 02:29:26,237
MATT: All right, so that finishes that. Ending
Grog's turn, the legendary actions return now.

2814
02:29:26,237 --> 02:29:27,764
SAM: Return?

2815
02:29:27,764 --> 02:29:28,739
MATT: Yes.

2816
02:29:28,739 --> 02:29:30,463
SAM: But he's just used them!

2817
02:29:30,463 --> 02:29:36,147
MATT: Yeah, it comes back at the end of his next
round. At the beginning of his round, you watch as

2818
02:29:36,147 --> 02:29:41,682
his form begins to seal up the wounds he had
taken, beginning to heal ever-so-slightly.

2819
02:29:41,682 --> 02:29:44,016
LAURA: It's his turn now.

2820
02:29:44,016 --> 02:29:52,042
MATT: He reaches down and grabs the bow from the
ground, and you watch as he sinks down into the

2821
02:29:52,042 --> 02:29:55,482
ground, roots reaching up and grabbing him,
and he vanishes into the bottom of the tree.

2822
02:29:55,482 --> 02:30:00,869
MARISHA: Whoa. Yeah.

2823
02:30:00,869 --> 02:30:03,610
That makes sense. It's what I would do.

2824
02:30:03,706 --> 02:30:07,505
SAM: He's getting that invisible figurine that he
has.

2825
02:30:07,505 --> 02:30:09,799
MATT: And reemerges--

2826
02:30:09,799 --> 02:30:13,501
SAM: Oh, hi. Hi, friend.

2827
02:30:13,501 --> 02:30:17,669
MATT: -- way up in the top of the tree, out of the
branches up there, his upper torso extends outward

2828
02:30:17,669 --> 02:30:19,689
and he pulls back the bow--

2829
02:30:19,689 --> 02:30:20,732
LAURA: Oh no.

2830
02:30:20,732 --> 02:30:24,019
MATT: -- and begins just unleashing arrows that
are forming out of his hand, these thin

2831
02:30:24,019 --> 02:30:31,081
thorn-like arrows are built out of his viny-like
arm, and he pulls back and releases them as they

2832
02:30:31,363 --> 02:30:37,329
snap as arrows towards you guys. He's going to
make a bramble-shot attack at you, Grog.

2833
02:30:37,329 --> 02:30:40,408
SAM: Bramble-shot. Sounds tasty.

2834
02:30:40,408 --> 02:30:44,025
MATT: That is going to be 21.

2835
02:30:44,025 --> 02:30:45,078
TRAVIS: Hits.

2836
02:30:45,078 --> 02:30:56,657
MATT: That hits. All right. So you take 14 points
of piercing damage, reduced to half, so you take

2837
02:30:56,657 --> 02:31:00,704
seven points, plus four points of lightning
damage.

2838
02:31:00,704 --> 02:31:01,849
TRAVIS: Lightning damage?

2839
02:31:01,849 --> 02:31:03,430
(Computer alert sound.)

2840
02:31:03,430 --> 02:31:05,166
SAM: Hi, hi Liam.

2841
02:31:05,166 --> 02:31:07,481
LIAM: Not my computer.

2842
02:31:07,481 --> 02:31:14,516
MATT: Plus an additional 18 points of piercing
damage.

2843
02:31:14,516 --> 02:31:15,782
TRAVIS: Halved?

2844
02:31:15,782 --> 02:31:17,154
MATT: Halved to nine.

2845
02:31:17,154 --> 02:31:18,150
LAURA: Wow.

2846
02:31:18,150 --> 02:31:22,671
MATT: As the arrow hits you, and then bursts into
a series of jagged, thorny vines that wrap around

2847
02:31:22,671 --> 02:31:25,342
you. I need you to make a strength saving throw.

2848
02:31:25,342 --> 02:31:27,745
TRAVIS: That's pretty awesome.

2849
02:31:27,745 --> 02:31:29,990
TALIESIN: We're gonna set him on fire, we're gonna
hit him with light,

2850
02:31:29,990 --> 02:31:31,447
we're gonna hit him with things.

2851
02:31:31,447 --> 02:31:32,805
MARISHA: I was thinking fire too.

2852
02:31:32,805 --> 02:31:34,889
LAURA: Lightning. Lightning? Has anybody tried
electricity yet?

2853
02:31:34,889 --> 02:31:35,878
TRAVIS: 22.

2854
02:31:35,878 --> 02:31:39,708
MATT: 22. You feel the bramble vines wrap around
you and try to hold you in place, and you just

2855
02:31:39,708 --> 02:31:41,575
angrily burst out of them.

2856
02:31:41,575 --> 02:31:42,848
SAM: Yes!

2857
02:31:42,848 --> 02:31:43,533
LAURA: Yes!

2858
02:31:43,533 --> 02:31:44,211
MARISHA: Fuck yeah!

2859
02:31:44,211 --> 02:31:45,196
MATT: You are not restrained.

2860
02:31:45,196 --> 02:31:46,694
SAM: Yes, for once.

2861
02:31:46,694 --> 02:31:48,998
MARISHA: (laughing) Yeah, you're not grappled.

2862
02:31:48,998 --> 02:31:51,259
MATT: He's gonna go ahead and unleash two more
arrows--

2863
02:31:51,259 --> 02:31:52,295
LAURA: Shit, Jesus.

2864
02:31:52,295 --> 02:31:56,511
MATT: -- this time towards you, as he's kind of
focused now on the--

2865
02:31:56,511 --> 02:31:57,902
LAURA: Both of them at me?

2866
02:31:57,902 --> 02:31:59,317
MATT: Yeah.

2867
02:31:59,317 --> 02:32:00,631
TRAVIS: Rejection's a bitch.

2868
02:32:00,631 --> 02:32:01,527
MARISHA: Yeah, rejection.

2869
02:32:01,527 --> 02:32:03,511
MATT: He's not too happy with being rejected,
it seems.

2870
02:32:03,511 --> 02:32:04,878
MARISHA: He's been alone for too long.

2871
02:32:04,878 --> 02:32:06,503
MATT: The first one is 24 to hit.

2872
02:32:06,503 --> 02:32:07,433
LAURA: That hits.

2873
02:32:07,433 --> 02:32:09,692
MATT: Second is a 25 to hit.

2874
02:32:09,692 --> 02:32:10,672
LAURA: Both hit.

2875
02:32:10,672 --> 02:32:12,070
MATT: All right.

2876
02:32:12,070 --> 02:32:13,335
LAURA: I'm gonna die.

2877
02:32:13,335 --> 02:32:14,304
MATT: So you take--

2878
02:32:14,304 --> 02:32:15,433
MARISHA: No, you're not.

2879
02:32:15,433 --> 02:32:21,009
SAM: Nah, you'll be fine. (whispering) She's dead.
She's dead. She's definitely dead.

2880
02:32:21,009 --> 02:32:28,614
MATT: 13 points of damage with one lightning, and,
that's a lucky roll, eight points of piercing

2881
02:32:28,614 --> 02:32:30,993
damage with one lightning.

2882
02:32:30,993 --> 02:32:32,300
LAURA: Okay.

2883
02:32:32,300 --> 02:32:35,732
MATT: As two additional arrows just wh-whack!
right inside of you, and you look down and can see

2884
02:32:35,732 --> 02:32:41,191
these large, thin stiletto-like wooden forms that
are just

2885
02:32:41,191 --> 02:32:43,742
pierced into your armor and cut into your flesh.

2886
02:32:43,742 --> 02:32:46,797
LAURA: Is that plus one additional lightning
damage, you mean?

2887
02:32:46,797 --> 02:32:47,562
MATT: Yeah.

2888
02:32:47,562 --> 02:32:48,900
LAURA: Okay, so 14 and nine?

2889
02:32:48,900 --> 02:32:55,375
MATT: Right. Yep. That's gonna end Sondur's turn.
The two dead trees that you saw quaking on the

2890
02:32:55,375 --> 02:33:03,745
sides suddenly burst out, the roots becoming legs,
and you watch as two treants emerge from the

2891
02:33:03,745 --> 02:33:05,018
sides of the tree.

2892
02:33:05,018 --> 02:33:06,868
TRAVIS: Oh, I was joking when I said it.

2893
02:33:06,868 --> 02:33:08,454
TALIESIN: You shouldn't have been.

2894
02:33:08,454 --> 02:33:09,338
SAM: Oh my god.

2895
02:33:09,338 --> 02:33:15,824
MATT: Large sort of freed and sentient trees begin
stomping forward towards you guys. This one is

2896
02:33:15,824 --> 02:33:24,450
going to go ahead and rush up to you folks,
while this one is gonna go right for Percy,

2897
02:33:24,450 --> 02:33:26,506
which is right in its side there.

2898
02:33:26,506 --> 02:33:28,507
SAM: God, this is a tough one.

2899
02:33:28,507 --> 02:33:30,141
MATT: Two slam attacks against you, Percy.

2900
02:33:30,141 --> 02:33:31,419
MARISHA: Ooh, fuck.

2901
02:33:31,419 --> 02:33:33,329
MATT: That is a 19 to hit.

2902
02:33:33,329 --> 02:33:34,458
TALIESIN: That hits.

2903
02:33:34,458 --> 02:33:36,329
MATT: And a natural 20.

2904
02:33:36,329 --> 02:33:39,443
TALIESIN: That doesn't hit.

2905
02:33:39,443 --> 02:33:41,570
MATT: All right.

2906
02:33:41,570 --> 02:33:43,017
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

2907
02:33:43,017 --> 02:33:54,093
MATT: That sucked. For you. Right, so the first
hit, you take 17 points of bludgeoning damage.

2908
02:33:54,093 --> 02:34:02,406
The second hit, 28 points of bludgeoning damage,
as the giant tree just whack! And as soon as you

2909
02:34:02,406 --> 02:34:05,621
try and get out of the way, the giant fist comes
down and slams you right across the neck and

2910
02:34:05,621 --> 02:34:11,234
shoulders, causing you to take a knee, and you can
feel the muscle pop from some sort of

2911
02:34:11,234 --> 02:34:19,330
overextension. The giant tree now, you can see its
bark contorted in this angry face as it pours more

2912
02:34:19,330 --> 02:34:23,763
of that black oil-like liquid out of the corner of
its mouth. The other one that's rushed up against

2913
02:34:23,763 --> 02:34:27,682
the two of you is going to go ahead and take one
hit against you, Vex, and two hits against you,

2914
02:34:27,682 --> 02:34:33,113
Vax. Sorry, it only gets two slams. One on each.
My apologies.

2915
02:34:33,113 --> 02:34:36,383
One against you, Vex, is going to
be sixteen.

2916
02:34:36,383 --> 02:34:37,463
LAURA: Oh, it misses.

2917
02:34:37,463 --> 02:34:38,619
SAM: Hey!

2918
02:34:38,619 --> 02:34:42,173
MATT: You duck out of the way and it actually
slams the large root tree to the front of you.

2919
02:34:42,173 --> 02:34:45,876
The other one goes to Vax. That is going to be a
26 to hit.

2920
02:34:45,876 --> 02:34:49,870
LIAM: Oh yeah. Uncanny dodge.

2921
02:34:49,870 --> 02:34:52,128
MATT: Okay, so you take--

2922
02:34:52,128 --> 02:34:55,949
LIAM: Oh, at disadvantage, excuse me, because of
the cloak of displacement.

2923
02:34:55,949 --> 02:34:59,011
MATT: Rolled an 18 on the second one, so it still
hits you.

2924
02:34:59,011 --> 02:35:03,508
So that effect goes away, but you would take
18 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to nine

2925
02:35:03,508 --> 02:35:11,510
because of your Uncanny Dodge. All right,
that ends their turn. Now it is Scanlan and

2926
02:35:11,510 --> 02:35:14,371
Keyleth's turn. What are you guys doing?

2927
02:35:14,371 --> 02:35:16,651
SAM: Preference?

2928
02:35:16,651 --> 02:35:18,664
MARISHA: I'm gonna go for the ents.

2929
02:35:18,664 --> 02:35:20,152
SAM: I'm gonna go for the big guy.

2930
02:35:20,152 --> 02:35:21,769
MARISHA: All right. So you go first, then.

2931
02:35:21,769 --> 02:35:26,737
SAM: All right. I'm gonna go a couple steps to the
right,

2932
02:35:26,737 --> 02:35:28,950
like split the difference between me and
Percy.

2933
02:35:28,950 --> 02:35:30,840
MATT: All righty.

2934
02:35:30,840 --> 02:35:35,570
SAM: I will cast, I will use the wand of...
well, jeez,

2935
02:35:35,570 --> 02:35:37,385
lightning or fire, lightning or fire.

2936
02:35:37,385 --> 02:35:37,944
MARISHA: Fire.

2937
02:35:37,944 --> 02:35:39,064
LAURA: Try fire.

2938
02:35:39,064 --> 02:35:42,363
SAM: Wand of fireballs, I'll use three charges.

2939
02:35:42,363 --> 02:35:43,556
MARISHA: Fuck yeah.

2940
02:35:43,556 --> 02:35:45,777
SAM: At the big guy upstairs.

2941
02:35:45,777 --> 02:35:46,538
MATT: Up there?

2942
02:35:46,538 --> 02:35:47,048
SAM: Yeah.

2943
02:35:47,048 --> 02:35:47,836
MATT: Okay.

2944
02:35:47,836 --> 02:35:48,967
MARISHA: Pew-pew.

2945
02:35:48,967 --> 02:35:50,387
LAURA: Big guy upstairs. Santa Claus?

2946
02:35:50,387 --> 02:35:52,913
MARISHA: The CEO of this tree.

2947
02:35:52,913 --> 02:35:54,409
MATT: DC of what on the spell?

2948
02:35:54,409 --> 02:35:56,715
SAM: 15.

2949
02:35:56,715 --> 02:35:59,224
MATT: That, yeah, he makes his save with a 19.
So half-damage,

2950
02:35:59,224 --> 02:36:03,019
go ahead and roll that, five charges?

2951
02:36:03,019 --> 02:36:07,767
SAM: I'm going to use three, I get three charges
and then two more is five...

2952
02:36:07,767 --> 02:36:08,896
yeah, five. Yes, five.

2953
02:36:08,896 --> 02:36:09,848
MATT: Yes, so--

2954
02:36:09,848 --> 02:36:11,007
SAM: So it's 10d6.

2955
02:36:11,007 --> 02:36:12,015
MATT: Correct.

2956
02:36:12,015 --> 02:36:25,909
SAM: Okay. Six, eight, 14, 16, 17. 23... 28, 32.
33.

2957
02:36:25,909 --> 02:36:26,566
MATT: 33.

2958
02:36:26,566 --> 02:36:27,690
SAM: Halved.

2959
02:36:27,690 --> 02:36:34,846
MATT: Half that for 15, or 16 actually, sorry.
16 points of fire damage as the Fireball bursts

2960
02:36:34,846 --> 02:36:40,458
up where you can see some of the roots are blown
off and a bit of the upper ceiling collapses and

2961
02:36:40,458 --> 02:36:41,681
hangs for a second.

2962
02:36:41,681 --> 02:36:43,789
LAURA: Did it look like it actually affected him,
the fire?

2963
02:36:43,789 --> 02:36:46,288
MATT: It looked like he took damage from it,
yeah.

2964
02:36:46,288 --> 02:36:47,554
TRAVIS: It didn't catch fire.

2965
02:36:47,554 --> 02:36:51,451
MATT: It didn't seem to catch fire, no. In fact,
the decaying liquid

2966
02:36:51,451 --> 02:36:54,176
it seems to be spewing out of it, it's almost--

2967
02:36:54,176 --> 02:36:55,428
TRAVIS: A natural retardant?

2968
02:36:55,428 --> 02:36:59,368
MATT: Yeah, it's preventing any flame from
catching on the creature in the vicinity as the

2969
02:36:59,368 --> 02:37:05,607
flames slowly go out. The vines begin to reform to
close up the ceiling, and you see Sondur is still

2970
02:37:05,607 --> 02:37:11,890
kind of gliding through the vines and using them
to move along the upper outside of the tree.

2971
02:37:11,890 --> 02:37:13,760
Is that going to be the end of your movement?

2972
02:37:13,760 --> 02:37:18,777
SAM: Yeah, I'll use a bonus action, gah,
do I heal or do I inspire? What's more helpful

2973
02:37:18,777 --> 02:37:23,664
here? I will heal Percy a little bit.

2974
02:37:23,664 --> 02:37:28,496
I can only cast Healing Word at level one 
as a bonus action, right?

2975
02:37:28,496 --> 02:37:30,167
MATT: You can cast it at any level you want to as
a bonus action.

2976
02:37:30,167 --> 02:37:30,708
SAM: Oh, okay.

2977
02:37:30,708 --> 02:37:32,263
MATT: Since you didn't actually cast a spell,
you used the wand.

2978
02:37:32,263 --> 02:37:37,639
SAM: Oh, that's true. Okay, well then I'll do it
at, uh, level two.

2979
02:37:37,639 --> 02:37:38,435
TALIESIN: Okay.

2980
02:37:38,435 --> 02:37:44,582
SAM: I don't know what I'm gonna need today.
It's 2d4 plus five.

2981
02:37:44,582 --> 02:37:46,106
TALIESIN: Okay. Do you roll that or do I?

2982
02:37:46,106 --> 02:37:47,067
SAM: I do.

2983
02:37:47,067 --> 02:37:48,811
MATT: Plus six, technically, because your charisma
went up.

2984
02:37:48,811 --> 02:37:56,478
SAM: Ooh! Oh, nice. I will sing to him, let's see
if I can do this. "Come on, come on, get your

2985
02:37:56,478 --> 02:38:03,001
Scanlan on, it's Thursday night and it won't be
long, gonna play my flute, play my shawm,

2986
02:38:03,001 --> 02:38:08,892
it's Thursday night and it won't be long 'til I
get your health up, get your health up, I got all

2987
02:38:08,892 --> 02:38:14,957
you need, no I don't shoot bows, I don't swing
swords, but damn I can sing."

2988
02:38:14,957 --> 02:38:18,141
(All cheer.)

2989
02:38:18,141 --> 02:38:20,079
MATT: You take that god damn inspiration.

2990
02:38:20,079 --> 02:38:22,004
MARISHA: That was really good!

2991
02:38:22,004 --> 02:38:24,800
LIAM: Sang for his supper.

2992
02:38:24,800 --> 02:38:29,431
SAM: 4d4 plus six. Er. Four plus six, ten.
Ten, ugh!

2993
02:38:29,431 --> 02:38:30,930
LAURA: Ten is better than nothing!

2994
02:38:30,930 --> 02:38:32,330
MARISHA: That's pretty good.

2995
02:38:32,330 --> 02:38:36,422
MATT: Ten hit points as the song pushes your
healing at a rapid pace because it's so inspiring.

2996
02:38:36,422 --> 02:38:39,006
All right. Are you staying where you are,
Scanlan?

2997
02:38:39,006 --> 02:38:42,277
SAM: I already moved a little bit, I'm gonna stick
right there, yeah.

2998
02:38:42,277 --> 02:38:46,202
MATT: Yeah, you moved ten feet, so you're gonna
stay there? Okay. Keyleth.

2999
02:38:46,202 --> 02:38:50,991
MARISHA: Okay, so these trees that are moving
appear to be living trees more or less, correct?

3000
02:38:50,991 --> 02:38:53,429
MATT: Appear to be, yeah. From what you can tell.

3001
02:38:53,429 --> 02:38:57,504
MARISHA: I'm gonna cast Tree Stride on myself.

3002
02:38:57,504 --> 02:38:59,779
MATT: Okay.

3003
02:38:59,779 --> 02:39:04,929
MARISHA: And then I'm gonna go into fire elemental
form and flame on.

3004
02:39:04,929 --> 02:39:06,087
TALIESIN: Yeah!

3005
02:39:06,087 --> 02:39:07,416
LAURA: Oh shit, girl!

3006
02:39:07,416 --> 02:39:08,590
SAM: Have you done that before?

3007
02:39:08,590 --> 02:39:10,628
MARISHA: No, and I don't know if it's really gonna
work.

3008
02:39:10,628 --> 02:39:12,383
SAM: You're Johnny Storm?

3009
02:39:12,383 --> 02:39:13,394
LAURA: Flame on!

3010
02:39:13,394 --> 02:39:15,110
MARISHA: Oh, I've been a fire elemental before,
yeah.

3011
02:39:15,110 --> 02:39:17,706
MATT: So you're gonna move next to this tree,
then? Is that what you're gonna do?

3012
02:39:17,706 --> 02:39:20,046
MARISHA: Well, I'm casting Tree Stride.

3013
02:39:20,046 --> 02:39:24,544
MATT: Right, but Tree Stride, you have to,
you have the ability to enter a tree. You must

3014
02:39:24,544 --> 02:39:26,701
use five feet of movement to enter a tree.

3015
02:39:26,701 --> 02:39:30,343
MARISHA: Right. I'm casting Tree Stride because
it's a concentration that lasts a minute.

3016
02:39:30,343 --> 02:39:31,372
MATT: Right.

3017
02:39:31,372 --> 02:39:34,722
MARISHA: And then I'm going to use my bonus action
to flame on.

3018
02:39:34,722 --> 02:39:40,117
MATT: Okay.

3019
02:39:40,117 --> 02:39:41,755
LAURA: This is pretty cool.

3020
02:39:41,755 --> 02:39:44,611
MARISHA: If this works.

3021
02:39:44,611 --> 02:39:48,401
MATT: Where once was Keyleth is now a fire
elemental.

3022
02:39:48,401 --> 02:39:50,215
LAURA: I fell over, I was so impressed.

3023
02:39:50,215 --> 02:39:55,689
MARISHA: All the rage of the fire ashari.
And then I'm going to enter inside that treant

3024
02:39:55,689 --> 02:39:57,577
right in front of me.

3025
02:39:57,577 --> 02:39:59,551
LAURA: She's going to enter inside of it.

3026
02:39:59,551 --> 02:40:05,837
MARISHA: I'm going to very nicely enter it with
its permission and consent.

3027
02:40:05,837 --> 02:40:07,383
MATT: Okay.

3028
02:40:07,383 --> 02:40:14,463
MARISHA: And then I'm going to multi-attack.

3029
02:40:14,463 --> 02:40:20,047
MATT: So you're using this to just stay within the
tree while punching it on fire.

3030
02:40:20,047 --> 02:40:29,192
MARISHA: Well, ideally, because as per the rules
of Tree Stride, I may use, I instantly know the

3031
02:40:29,192 --> 02:40:34,109
location of all other trees of the same kind and
as part of my movement I can pass into

3032
02:40:34,109 --> 02:40:36,893
any other trees of my choice of that same kind.

3033
02:40:36,893 --> 02:40:37,998
MATT: Yep.

3034
02:40:37,998 --> 02:40:40,180
MARISHA: So I'm gonna take this guy on for right
now.

3035
02:40:40,180 --> 02:40:43,650
MATT: Okay, go for it. So, make your attack rolls
against this treant.

3036
02:40:43,650 --> 02:40:45,343
TRAVIS: Interesting, Keyleth.

3037
02:40:45,343 --> 02:40:46,969
TALIESIN: You are doing some crazy shit.

3038
02:40:46,969 --> 02:40:48,174
LAURA: Crazy shit.

3039
02:40:48,174 --> 02:40:49,157
MARISHA: We'll see.

3040
02:40:49,157 --> 02:40:50,743
SAM: We brought a gun to a tree-fight.

3041
02:40:50,743 --> 02:40:54,025
(All laugh.)

3042
02:40:54,025 --> 02:41:00,779
MARISHA: Those are pretty good. The first hit,
sorry, I don't know my... I'm trying to find what

3043
02:41:00,779 --> 02:41:07,167
I add here. Okay. So the first one is going to be
25 to hit.

3044
02:41:07,167 --> 02:41:08,787
MATT: 25 hits, yep.

3045
02:41:08,787 --> 02:41:10,243
MARISHA: And the second one's going to be 16.

3046
02:41:10,243 --> 02:41:11,121
MATT: Just barely hits.

3047
02:41:11,121 --> 02:41:12,980
MARISHA: Fuck yeah.

3048
02:41:12,980 --> 02:41:16,316
LIAM: (Malone voice) They send one of yours to the
Feywild, you send one of theirs to the morgue.

3049
02:41:16,316 --> 02:41:18,430
(All laugh.)

3050
02:41:18,430 --> 02:41:20,894
MATT: Don't forget your additional, because even
if you're a fire elemental you still get your

3051
02:41:20,894 --> 02:41:22,259
additional fire damage.

3052
02:41:22,259 --> 02:41:24,003
MARISHA: Flame hands, which is an additional d6,
correct?

3053
02:41:24,003 --> 02:41:25,052
MATT: Correct.

3054
02:41:25,052 --> 02:41:36,165
MARISHA: So I am rolling 2d6 plus three twice,
so I'll do 4d... or, I'll roll 3d6 twice.

3055
02:41:36,165 --> 02:41:45,621
First one... not bad. Eight plus five is 13,
plus another three, so 16. 16 for the first one.

3056
02:41:45,621 --> 02:41:50,439
MATT: 16 points of fire damage, all right.
All right, the next one?

3057
02:41:50,439 --> 02:41:57,830
MARISHA: The next one is 14.

3058
02:41:57,830 --> 02:42:01,108
MATT: All right.

3059
02:42:01,108 --> 02:42:09,409
MARISHA: And until the creature takes an action to
douse the fire, the target takes-- oh, it also,

3060
02:42:09,409 --> 02:42:17,699
anything that if I move within, it immediately
takes 1d10 damage whenever I move into its space.

3061
02:42:17,699 --> 02:42:21,917
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll another
d10.

3062
02:42:21,917 --> 02:42:25,097
MARISHA: Nine.

3063
02:42:25,097 --> 02:42:27,544
SAM: Also, if it's a tree it instantly dies.

3064
02:42:27,544 --> 02:42:29,351
LAURA: That's just the rule, that's just what it
says.

3065
02:42:29,351 --> 02:42:32,288
MATT: You notice as you tear into its body with
the Tree Stride to open it up, it looks down

3066
02:42:32,288 --> 02:42:36,729
confused as you pull into it and then just begin
pummeling and scraping the inside of its form.

3067
02:42:36,729 --> 02:42:44,916
As you do so, from the inside, what little bit of
fire retardant-like black liquid was somewhat

3068
02:42:44,916 --> 02:42:50,031
dried or coated on these, not as thick as it was
on Sondur, not only has it caught fire but the

3069
02:42:50,031 --> 02:42:55,680
wood here is very, very ready for kindling,
and it's vulnerable to fire, everything in that

3070
02:42:55,680 --> 02:42:57,870
was doubled, so you just tear into it--

3071
02:42:57,870 --> 02:42:59,746
(All yell.)

3072
02:42:59,746 --> 02:43:03,193
MATT: You just watch as this treant has a flaming
elemental in its stomach just bursting forth in

3073
02:43:03,193 --> 02:43:09,937
gouts of fire. You watch as it begins to crack up
the center and parts of it are just bursting into

3074
02:43:09,937 --> 02:43:11,719
flames and burning at the top.

3075
02:43:11,719 --> 02:43:12,562
LAURA: Holy crap.

3076
02:43:12,562 --> 02:43:14,061
MATT: It's having a bad day right now.

3077
02:43:14,061 --> 02:43:15,948
LAURA: Keyleth. Serious.

3078
02:43:15,948 --> 02:43:17,851
MATT: Is that the end of your turn?

3079
02:43:17,851 --> 02:43:19,649
MARISHA: That I am satisfied with, yes.

3080
02:43:19,649 --> 02:43:22,958
MATT: All right. Ending Keyleth's turn, that
brings us to Vex, you're up.

3081
02:43:22,958 --> 02:43:28,115
LAURA: Okay. I'm gonna step just a little bit away
from that flaming tree.

3082
02:43:28,115 --> 02:43:31,428
MARISHA: Yes. It is now a safety hazard.

3083
02:43:31,428 --> 02:43:33,237
LAURA: To the side, I'm just gonna step to the
side. Yeah.

3084
02:43:33,237 --> 02:43:34,950
MARISHA: Careful for falling limbs.

3085
02:43:34,950 --> 02:43:40,525
LAURA: I'm gonna Hunter's Mark Sondur, damn it.

3086
02:43:40,525 --> 02:43:43,138
MATT: Okay, as you pull back it does get an attack
of opportunity on you.

3087
02:43:43,138 --> 02:43:44,551
LAURA: Aw.

3088
02:43:44,551 --> 02:43:46,692
MATT: That is an 18 plus ten, 28.

3089
02:43:46,692 --> 02:43:48,672
LAURA: Oh, fuck.

3090
02:43:48,672 --> 02:43:50,541
MATT: So you take--

3091
02:43:50,541 --> 02:43:51,800
SAM: A billion.

3092
02:43:51,800 --> 02:43:53,856
MATT: -- 17 points of bludgeoning damage as you
rush back--

3093
02:43:53,856 --> 02:43:54,845
LAURA: Motherfucker.

3094
02:43:54,845 --> 02:43:58,759
MATT: -- and the flaming treant just reaches out
and strikes you across the back of the head,

3095
02:43:58,759 --> 02:44:02,987
almost sending you tumbling to the ground.
Giant dull thud in the back, you can feel the

3096
02:44:02,987 --> 02:44:04,704
headache growing in your skull, but you continue
forward.

3097
02:44:04,704 --> 02:44:10,607
LAURA: Ah! (strained) Fuck you. Okay. I Hunter's
Mark Sandor. Sandor?

3098
02:44:10,607 --> 02:44:11,640
MARISHA: Sondur.

3099
02:44:11,640 --> 02:44:13,113
TALIESIN: Sondur.

3100
02:44:13,113 --> 02:44:15,765
LAURA: Sondur, Sondur. Sandor is in Game of
Thrones.

3101
02:44:15,765 --> 02:44:16,865
MATT: Yes.

3102
02:44:16,865 --> 02:44:23,161
LAURA: And then I'm going to attack him with the
sky sentinel bow.

3103
02:44:23,161 --> 02:44:26,523
MATT: Go for it.

3104
02:44:26,523 --> 02:44:36,524
LAURA: (nervous noises) 17 on the first one.

3105
02:44:36,524 --> 02:44:37,385
MATT: Misses.

3106
02:44:37,385 --> 02:44:38,875
LAURA: Natural 20 on the second one.

3107
02:44:38,875 --> 02:44:39,696
MARISHA: What up!

3108
02:44:39,696 --> 02:44:43,519
LAURA: And 19 on the third.

3109
02:44:43,519 --> 02:44:44,517
MATT: Misses.

3110
02:44:44,517 --> 02:44:46,601
LAURA: Fucking balls mother bitch, okay, wow.

3111
02:44:46,601 --> 02:44:49,635
MATT: But the critical hit, so go ahead and roll
damage for the critical.

3112
02:44:49,635 --> 02:44:51,378
LAURA: So what, do I just double all my dice?

3113
02:44:51,378 --> 02:44:58,313
MATT: Yeah, double the dice and then add the bonus
at the end.

3114
02:44:58,313 --> 02:44:59,966
SAM: How's the Sky bar?

3115
02:44:59,966 --> 02:45:02,709
MARISHA: I think this is caramel? Nope, fudge.

3116
02:45:02,709 --> 02:45:04,019
TALIESIN: Oh, you got the fudge end.

3117
02:45:04,019 --> 02:45:05,591
MARISHA: I got the fudge end.

3118
02:45:05,591 --> 02:45:14,431
LAURA: 16 times two is 32, yeah? Plus seven,
plus two. 41.

3119
02:45:14,431 --> 02:45:17,625
MATT: 41 points of damage.

3120
02:45:17,625 --> 02:45:23,332
LAURA: On the first attack. And then I'll attack
him again. 'Cause that was just one.

3121
02:45:23,332 --> 02:45:26,472
MATT: Right, that was the sky sentinel. You didn't
double the bonus, right,

3122
02:45:26,472 --> 02:45:28,098
that was just the dice roll?

3123
02:45:28,098 --> 02:45:29,468
LAURA: Nope, I just doubled the dice.

3124
02:45:29,468 --> 02:45:32,415
MATT: Shit, yeah, with Hunter's Mark, yeah,
that's slick. All right, go for it.

3125
02:45:32,415 --> 02:45:35,470
LAURA: Okay, so the second one, I'm gonna attack
him through the blazing bowstring.

3126
02:45:35,470 --> 02:45:38,898
MATT: Go for it.

3127
02:45:38,898 --> 02:45:40,992
LAURA: And that is a 30.

3128
02:45:40,992 --> 02:45:42,547
MATT: 30 hits, yes.

3129
02:45:42,547 --> 02:45:44,509
TRAVIS: How high is Sondur?

3130
02:45:44,509 --> 02:45:50,361
MATT: He is roughly 30 feet up.

3131
02:45:50,361 --> 02:45:52,984
TALIESIN: At the very least, I might try and get
him to drop the bow, and then you're gonna be the

3132
02:45:52,984 --> 02:45:56,745
one who has to grab it if things get...

3133
02:45:56,745 --> 02:46:01,920
LAURA: Is 14 plus eight, is 22. 22 on the second.

3134
02:46:01,920 --> 02:46:03,961
MATT: 22 points of damage. Nice.

3135
02:46:03,961 --> 02:46:08,873
LAURA: And that was with eight points of fire
damage. I don't know if that matters.

3136
02:46:08,873 --> 02:46:11,680
LIAM: Is he pressed against the roof of this
chamber?

3137
02:46:11,680 --> 02:46:13,862
MATT: He's getting up towards the roof, yeah.

3138
02:46:13,862 --> 02:46:15,298
LIAM: Towards it.

3139
02:46:15,298 --> 02:46:19,585
MATT: As the two arrows shhhk to the side,
the one single arrow pierces into the side of his

3140
02:46:19,585 --> 02:46:23,452
chest and arm where Percy had shot before,
and the arrow disappears into the side,

3141
02:46:23,452 --> 02:46:27,624
and you see a burst of electrical energy causing
the one arm that was getting ready to pull one of

3142
02:46:27,624 --> 02:46:31,406
its thorny arrows kind of goes limp for a second,
and a second arrow just shoots right in the side

3143
02:46:31,406 --> 02:46:35,759
of the face and is now protruding from underneath
his cheekbone. (angry breathing)

3144
02:46:35,759 --> 02:46:40,419
LAURA: And for my movement, can I get on my broom
for my movement?

3145
02:46:40,419 --> 02:46:41,794
MATT: You'd have to--

3146
02:46:41,794 --> 02:46:43,199
LAURA: I'd have to pull it out.

3147
02:46:43,199 --> 02:46:45,608
MATT: Your broom is kind of slung over your
shoulder.

3148
02:46:45,608 --> 02:46:51,021
LAURA: Right. Okay. Then I'm just gonna...
I feel like anywhere I go it's danger-zone in

3149
02:46:51,021 --> 02:46:53,297
here. I'm gonna try to hide behind that tree in
the middle,

3150
02:46:53,297 --> 02:46:55,338
but I feel like that's a bad idea. Yeah.

3151
02:46:55,338 --> 02:46:59,364
MATT: You're right there.

3152
02:46:59,364 --> 02:47:02,118
LAURA: I don't want him to be able to hit me with
arrows if possible.

3153
02:47:02,118 --> 02:47:07,091
MATT: Right, no worries. At the end of your turn,
he's going to use two of his legendary actions to

3154
02:47:07,091 --> 02:47:14,711
try and cast a different spell, actually.
He begins to, from up there above, lifts his hand

3155
02:47:14,711 --> 02:47:23,874
up like this. I need everyone but Grog to make a
dexterity saving throw, including the treants.

3156
02:47:23,874 --> 02:47:25,660
MARISHA: Including me inside the treant?

3157
02:47:25,660 --> 02:47:28,474
SAM: I guess I will try to counterspell this one
as well.

3158
02:47:28,474 --> 02:47:30,374
MATT: Okay.

3159
02:47:30,374 --> 02:47:33,064
SAM: Also at level five, I don't know if that
helps.

3160
02:47:33,064 --> 02:47:37,546
MATT: All right. So go ahead and roll, plus six.

3161
02:47:37,546 --> 02:47:41,806
SAM: All right. Plus six? 16.

3162
02:47:41,806 --> 02:47:54,597
MATT: Nope. Sorry. Close, you were one off.
So dexterity saving throws for the treants.

3163
02:47:54,597 --> 02:47:58,353
Nope. And nope.

3164
02:47:58,353 --> 02:48:00,076
LAURA: 17.

3165
02:48:00,076 --> 02:48:01,163
LIAM: 29.

3166
02:48:01,163 --> 02:48:02,674
MATT: So Vax succeeds.

3167
02:48:02,674 --> 02:48:04,520
LAURA: 17.

3168
02:48:04,520 --> 02:48:06,574
MATT: Grog, you don't have to worry about it,
'cause you're out of the radius.

3169
02:48:06,574 --> 02:48:07,607
MARISHA: 16.

3170
02:48:07,607 --> 02:48:10,417
TALIESIN: 14.

3171
02:48:10,417 --> 02:48:11,379
SAM: Oh, am I rolling for--

3172
02:48:11,379 --> 02:48:12,295
MATT: Yes, you are.

3173
02:48:12,295 --> 02:48:13,763
SAM: What is the save?

3174
02:48:13,763 --> 02:48:15,338
MATT: This is a dexterity saving throw.

3175
02:48:15,338 --> 02:48:20,158
SAM: Dexterity saving throw. 14.

3176
02:48:20,158 --> 02:48:27,851
MATT: All right. Vax, only you succeed. Suddenly
you feel as if there is a sense of weightlessness,

3177
02:48:27,851 --> 02:48:31,973
or at least you're being drawn at a very intense
speed upward in the room. Vax, you manage to reach

3178
02:48:31,973 --> 02:48:35,052
down and grab one of the roots on the ground and
hold yourself there while the rest of you are

3179
02:48:35,052 --> 02:48:39,690
thrown, including the treants, at a similar
velocity as you would plummet off a cliff,

3180
02:48:39,690 --> 02:48:47,124
but upward. Up into the ceiling and roof,
slamming into the roots, crack! And then gravity

3181
02:48:47,124 --> 02:48:53,879
returns to normal and all of you fall, once again,
slamming back down onto the ground.

3182
02:48:53,879 --> 02:48:57,102
MARISHA: Am I immune to that as a fire elemental?

3183
02:48:57,102 --> 02:49:00,671
MATT: You still take bludgeoning damage as an
elemental.

3184
02:49:00,671 --> 02:49:04,973
MARISHA: Just resistant to it.

3185
02:49:04,973 --> 02:49:07,643
SAM: How high's the roof above the ground?

3186
02:49:07,643 --> 02:49:13,173
MATT: It's about 50 feet at the top.

3187
02:49:13,173 --> 02:49:16,249
LAURA: So 100... no, that's just two times in a
row.

3188
02:49:16,249 --> 02:49:17,653
SAM: Two 50 drops.

3189
02:49:17,653 --> 02:49:18,806
LAURA: Wow.

3190
02:49:18,806 --> 02:49:29,474
MATT: That's a total of 24 points of bludgeoning
damage to all of you except for Vax.

3191
02:49:29,474 --> 02:49:30,960
MARISHA: I take half damage.

3192
02:49:30,960 --> 02:49:32,589
MATT: You take half that, because--

3193
02:49:32,589 --> 02:49:33,983
MARISHA: How much did you say it was? 24?

3194
02:49:33,983 --> 02:49:34,701
SAM: 24.

3195
02:49:34,701 --> 02:49:37,083
MATT: Not you, Grog, you're unaffected by it.
Yeah. But the treants also take it.

3196
02:49:37,083 --> 02:49:40,691
SAM: Oh! Poor guys.

3197
02:49:40,691 --> 02:49:45,031
MATT: All righty.

3198
02:49:45,031 --> 02:49:47,557
SAM: No problem, no problem.

3199
02:49:47,557 --> 02:49:52,115
MATT: End of Vex's turn. Vax, you're up.
You watch as all of your friends and the treants

3200
02:49:52,115 --> 02:49:56,919
come crashing down from the ceiling, slamming,
you hear the groans of various people getting up

3201
02:49:56,919 --> 02:50:00,624
off of root knots on the ground.

3202
02:50:00,624 --> 02:50:03,077
Your feet come back to you, and it's your
go.

3203
02:50:03,077 --> 02:50:06,463
LIAM: So the treants are prone, right?

3204
02:50:06,463 --> 02:50:09,233
MATT: In fact, everybody here for the most part is
prone, yes.

3205
02:50:09,233 --> 02:50:13,985
LIAM: Everybody's prone, and that gives me
advantage on the attack as well, doesn't it?

3206
02:50:13,985 --> 02:50:15,571
MATT: Technically, yes.

3207
02:50:15,571 --> 02:50:17,958
MARISHA: I'm immune to prone.

3208
02:50:17,958 --> 02:50:24,044
LIAM: All right, so I'm just gonna whip down and
stab into the treant that's at my feet now.

3209
02:50:24,044 --> 02:50:25,948
MATT: All righty, go for it.

3210
02:50:25,948 --> 02:50:28,417
LIAM: Okay, first attack is a 29.

3211
02:50:28,417 --> 02:50:29,865
MATT: That definitely hits.

3212
02:50:29,865 --> 02:50:34,491
LIAM: Well, actually, yeah, 29. Second attack is a
29.

3213
02:50:34,491 --> 02:50:35,820
MATT: Hits.

3214
02:50:35,820 --> 02:50:39,318
LIAM: Third attack is a 17.

3215
02:50:39,318 --> 02:50:41,086
MATT: Hits. All three hit.

3216
02:50:41,086 --> 02:50:42,104
LIAM: Okay, so the first one...

3217
02:50:42,104 --> 02:50:43,799
MATT: Percy, you're up next.

3218
02:50:43,799 --> 02:50:46,345
LIAM: Which is with the dagger of venom,
I don't know if it'll do anything, but I'm gonna

3219
02:50:46,345 --> 02:51:14,517
use the poison in it. Two... eight... 28, and the
poison DC on that is 15.

3220
02:51:14,585 --> 02:51:17,793
MATT: No, it does not succeed, it rolled a one.

3221
02:51:17,793 --> 02:51:21,803
LIAM: 11 points of poison damage on top of that.

3222
02:51:21,803 --> 02:51:23,249
MATT: All righty.

3223
02:51:23,249 --> 02:51:28,818
LIAM: Second attack does seven. This is the
flametongue dagger,

3224
02:51:28,818 --> 02:51:30,534
I don't know if that's going
to do anything--

3225
02:51:30,534 --> 02:51:32,523
MATT: Sorry, how much on the first attack again?

3226
02:51:32,523 --> 02:51:33,841
LIAM: And the third attack does--

3227
02:51:33,841 --> 02:51:36,229
TRAVIS: Liam, how much was your first attack?

3228
02:51:36,229 --> 02:51:39,657
LIAM: I don't remember, now. Uh, I can figure it
out...

3229
02:51:39,657 --> 02:51:44,501
MATT: Make sure I got it right.

3230
02:51:44,501 --> 02:51:49,400
LIAM: It was roughly, it was 20-something. 25.

3231
02:51:49,400 --> 02:51:53,044
MATT: Yeah, we're good, we're good. All right,
third strike?

3232
02:51:53,044 --> 02:51:54,690
LIAM: Third strike got eight.

3233
02:51:54,690 --> 02:51:56,196
MATT: Eight, got it.

3234
02:51:56,196 --> 02:51:57,140
LIAM: Thanks.

3235
02:51:57,140 --> 02:52:00,516
MATT: As it's on the ground, sprawled out,
flames still burning off of it, you leap up onto

3236
02:52:00,516 --> 02:52:05,317
its thigh and come down to some of the open wound
that Keyleth's fire elemental's been tearing

3237
02:52:05,317 --> 02:52:09,310
through, you're just prying into it with your
daggers and pulling the bark back, revealing its

3238
02:52:09,310 --> 02:52:19,066
softer, burning underwood, if you will. You do a
sincerely awful amount of damage to it, and it

3239
02:52:19,066 --> 02:52:22,462
looks like the creature's already in dire
straits.

3240
02:52:22,462 --> 02:52:24,006
SAM: This is one of the treants?

3241
02:52:24,006 --> 02:52:25,139
MATT: One of the treants, yes.

3242
02:52:25,139 --> 02:52:26,001
SAM: Oh, okay.

3243
02:52:26,001 --> 02:52:27,543
MATT: Does that end your turn?

3244
02:52:27,543 --> 02:52:31,397
LIAM: I just quickly look into Keyleth's flaming
eyes and say, "Finish it off," and then I'm going

3245
02:52:31,397 --> 02:52:40,260
to run double speed along the curve of the wall
underneath flying fuck.

3246
02:52:40,260 --> 02:52:41,288
MATT: This way?

3247
02:52:41,288 --> 02:52:41,979
LIAM: Yeah.

3248
02:52:41,979 --> 02:52:43,156
MARISHA: Other way, I think.

3249
02:52:43,156 --> 02:52:45,359
MATT: Oh, this way. The one that's not flaming?

3250
02:52:45,359 --> 02:52:48,232
LIAM: Past Keyleth and the one that I just stabbed
the shit out of.

3251
02:52:48,232 --> 02:52:49,706
LAURA: Oh, the other way, you were going the right
way.

3252
02:52:49,706 --> 02:52:50,640
MATT: This way.

3253
02:52:50,640 --> 02:52:51,595
LIAM: Yeah.

3254
02:52:51,595 --> 02:52:56,527
MATT: Okay. You're about there with your
movement.

3255
02:52:56,527 --> 02:52:58,410
LIAM: I've got double speed.

3256
02:52:58,410 --> 02:53:03,769
MATT: All right. Oh yeah, double speed, you'd
actually get closer to there if you wanted.

3257
02:53:03,769 --> 02:53:08,563
All right, that ends your turn. Percy, you're up.
Actually, at the end of Percy's turn he's gonna

3258
02:53:08,563 --> 02:53:15,595
use his last legendary action to go ahead and make
an attack with Fenthras. As he sees you running

3259
02:53:15,595 --> 02:53:18,996
past, Vax, he goes ahead and takes one arrow shot
at you

3260
02:53:18,996 --> 02:53:21,444
as you're running super fast across the
floor.

3261
02:53:21,444 --> 02:53:23,371
LIAM: Disadvantage.

3262
02:53:23,371 --> 02:53:25,046
MATT: No, because, well, no--

3263
02:53:25,046 --> 02:53:25,984
LIAM: Turns on--

3264
02:53:25,984 --> 02:53:30,346
MATT: -- no, you did, at the beginning of your
turn it did, you're right. So. Good thing, too,

3265
02:53:30,346 --> 02:53:37,141
19 and a one. It goes to fire but you're too
quick, and as it releases its spikelike arrow,

3266
02:53:37,141 --> 02:53:42,820
you hear it go right past you, catching the edge
of the cloak and actually going through it,

3267
02:53:42,820 --> 02:53:48,939
leaving a small hole in the corner, but no impact
to you. All right, so now, Percy, it's your turn.

3268
02:53:48,939 --> 02:53:52,346
TALIESIN: We're both prone, does that mean that
we're in combat,

3269
02:53:52,346 --> 02:53:54,258
or can I walk away from it and it doesn't--

3270
02:53:54,258 --> 02:53:56,403
MATT: You're both prone, you can walk away without
it getting an attack of opportunity, you just

3271
02:53:56,403 --> 02:53:58,227
spend half your movement to get up.

3272
02:53:58,227 --> 02:54:03,053
TALIESIN: All right, I'm spending half my movement
to get up, and I'm backing up against the wall.

3273
02:54:03,053 --> 02:54:05,323
MATT: Okay.

3274
02:54:05,323 --> 02:54:10,645
TALIESIN: Backing up against the wall. I'm not
using Bad News, I'm going to use Retort,

3275
02:54:10,645 --> 02:54:18,134
I'm going to try and, first thing I'm gonna do is
use a bonus action to heal a little bit. Yeah.

3276
02:54:18,134 --> 02:54:29,179
That's nine plus twelve, so that's 21. Figure
that out when it's not my turn. Next thing I'm

3277
02:54:29,179 --> 02:54:33,625
gonna do is I'm gonna start shooting to try and
get that bow out of his hands one more time.

3278
02:54:33,625 --> 02:54:34,714
MATT: Okay.

3279
02:54:34,714 --> 02:54:36,298
TALIESIN: First shot...

3280
02:54:36,298 --> 02:54:38,335
MATT: This is with Retort, right?

3281
02:54:38,335 --> 02:54:49,394
TALIESIN: Retort, yeah. Same trick, but not nearly
as much damage. That's 16 to hit?

3282
02:54:49,394 --> 02:54:54,620
MATT: Hits the nearby wood, splinters off one of
the vines, sending a shower of broken wood chips.

3283
02:54:54,620 --> 02:54:56,057
TALIESIN: Firing again.

3284
02:54:56,057 --> 02:54:57,820
LIAM: C'mon, dangerous nerd, do it!

3285
02:54:57,820 --> 02:55:00,294
LAURA: (laughs) Dangerous nerd.

3286
02:55:00,294 --> 02:55:03,786
TALIESIN: That's another 16.

3287
02:55:03,786 --> 02:55:07,522
MATT: Can't quite catch a bead on it. Being a
human without dark vision, it's hard to see it in

3288
02:55:07,522 --> 02:55:09,276
the low glowing light.

3289
02:55:09,276 --> 02:55:12,048
MARISHA: I give off a soft glow.

3290
02:55:12,048 --> 02:55:14,500
MATT: But at a distance.

3291
02:55:14,500 --> 02:55:16,067
TALIESIN: 18 to hit?

3292
02:55:16,067 --> 02:55:16,965
MATT: That misses.

3293
02:55:16,965 --> 02:55:21,216
(All groan.)

3294
02:55:21,216 --> 02:55:27,914
TALIESIN: God damn it. Okay. That's my bloody
roll.

3295
02:55:27,914 --> 02:55:30,320
MARISHA: That's always a bummer, man. That sucks.

3296
02:55:30,320 --> 02:55:34,585
MATT: Ending Percy's turn, that brings us to our
next set of lair actions. All right.

3297
02:55:34,585 --> 02:55:38,114
TALIESIN: God damn it.

3298
02:55:38,114 --> 02:55:43,057
MATT: Suddenly all the vines on the nearby walls
on the inside of the tree whip out and begin

3299
02:55:43,057 --> 02:55:51,651
grabbing anyone nearby. Percy, Scanlan, Keyleth,
and Vax, you guys are all of a sudden, the vines

3300
02:55:51,651 --> 02:55:55,623
try and wrap around you. They pull you back.

3301
02:55:55,623 --> 02:55:57,425
MARISHA: Immune to grapple.

3302
02:55:57,425 --> 02:55:58,113
MATT: So yeah.

3303
02:55:58,113 --> 02:55:59,246
LIAM: Dexterity save?

3304
02:55:59,246 --> 02:56:03,529
MATT: The vines try and wrap around you, Keyleth,
and burn in the process. You are still pulled

3305
02:56:03,529 --> 02:56:12,244
right against the wall. I need Vax, Scanlan,
and Percy to make a strength saving throw.

3306
02:56:12,244 --> 02:56:13,056
SAM: Strength.

3307
02:56:13,056 --> 02:56:13,903
LIAM: Strength.

3308
02:56:13,903 --> 02:56:14,813
MATT: Yes.

3309
02:56:14,813 --> 02:56:18,854
SAM: Oh, god. Just straight strength?

3310
02:56:18,854 --> 02:56:19,774
TALIESIN: 23.

3311
02:56:19,774 --> 02:56:21,055
SAM: 15.

3312
02:56:21,055 --> 02:56:22,573
LIAM: Burn a Luck. Ah, 20.

3313
02:56:22,573 --> 02:56:27,707
MATT: 20, okay. Vax and Percy, you guys manage to
break free of the vines. Scanlan, you are

3314
02:56:27,707 --> 02:56:31,277
considered grappled, so your speed is zero.
The vines are actually holding you against the

3315
02:56:31,277 --> 02:56:34,882
side. They're not hurting you or anything,
but you cannot actually move from your space

3316
02:56:34,882 --> 02:56:38,596
'cause you're being held against the wall of the
tree.

3317
02:56:38,596 --> 02:56:42,575
That ends the legendary action. Grog,
you're up.

3318
02:56:42,575 --> 02:56:47,627
TRAVIS: Can I run immediately underneath Sondur?

3319
02:56:47,627 --> 02:56:49,273
MATT: Sondur, yes you can.

3320
02:56:49,273 --> 02:56:54,274
TRAVIS: Are there any vines that are hanging from
him? There are none?

3321
02:56:54,274 --> 02:56:59,123
MATT: There are vines hanging from the ceiling,
but he himself just kind of sunk into the tree

3322
02:56:59,123 --> 02:57:03,987
and then emerged above, he himself does not have
any wayward vines that are just hanging.

3323
02:57:03,987 --> 02:57:06,828
TRAVIS: Right. Are there any vines that look like
they might be thick enough for me to try and climb

3324
02:57:06,828 --> 02:57:08,558
up if I wanted to get to his height?

3325
02:57:08,558 --> 02:57:10,631
MATT: Probably a couple, yeah.

3326
02:57:10,631 --> 02:57:17,471
TRAVIS: Could I grab a few of those vines to try
and climb up to where he's at?

3327
02:57:17,471 --> 02:57:21,900
MATT: Make an athletics check. With disadvantage.
And then you have advantage because you're

3328
02:57:21,900 --> 02:57:27,276
raging, so just a straight roll on that.

3329
02:57:27,276 --> 02:57:30,891
TRAVIS: Athletics. 23.

3330
02:57:30,891 --> 02:57:39,544
MATT: 23, all right, let me check and see how far
you can actually climb at that speed.

3331
02:57:39,544 --> 02:57:47,464
SAM: Tense fight, guys. Wouldn't wanna be in it
with anyone else.

3332
02:57:47,464 --> 02:57:49,693
LIAM: Us against the environment.

3333
02:57:49,693 --> 02:57:51,973
SAM: I think that my plan should work.

3334
02:57:51,973 --> 02:57:55,943
MATT: I'd say your physical strength and your
ability to just kind of one hand over hand,

3335
02:57:55,943 --> 02:58:00,065
not even pull up, especially with your Titan
gauntlets and that type of a roll, you could

3336
02:58:00,065 --> 02:58:03,523
probably get right up to him, but that's gonna be
your action to get up there.

3337
02:58:03,523 --> 02:58:04,527
TRAVIS: Okay.

3338
02:58:04,527 --> 02:58:08,040
MATT: So you'll only have your bonus action left
at that time, but essentially you climb up and get

3339
02:58:08,040 --> 02:58:13,122
right up to where he is at the top of the tree.
As he's up there pulling the bow back, getting

3340
02:58:13,122 --> 02:58:19,240
ready to, you see another pointed arrow kind of
shift out of his arm, you come right up to his

3341
02:58:19,240 --> 02:58:22,407
face and you're right there holding on with the
vines,

3342
02:58:22,407 --> 02:58:25,733
with the axe hanging over your shoulder
with the chain.

3343
02:58:25,733 --> 02:58:31,501
TRAVIS: With my bonus action, can I let out the
loudest howl I possibly can.

3344
02:58:31,501 --> 02:58:34,353
MATT: Yes, you can.

3345
02:58:34,353 --> 02:58:38,014
TRAVIS: (howls)

3346
02:58:38,014 --> 02:58:40,196
MATT: All righty.

3347
02:58:40,196 --> 02:58:42,998
MARISHA: Calling in the cavalry.

3348
02:58:42,998 --> 02:58:44,992
LAURA: Yeah, come on! Please, I hope he can get in
here.

3349
02:58:44,992 --> 02:58:45,908
MATT: That's your turn?

3350
02:58:45,908 --> 02:58:47,103
TRAVIS: That's my turn.

3351
02:58:47,103 --> 02:58:49,325
MATT: All right. It is now Sondur's turn.

3352
02:58:49,325 --> 02:58:51,153
SAM: Oh boy.

3353
02:58:51,153 --> 02:58:51,997
MATT: All righty.

3354
02:58:51,997 --> 02:58:54,067
LAURA: He's deaf from that howl, he's definitely
deaf.

3355
02:58:54,067 --> 02:59:03,120
MATT: No, not so much. Sondur takes Fenthras and
actually lets go of it to his side, and these

3356
02:59:03,120 --> 02:59:08,402
vines grab it and hold it in place just wherever
he lets it go. As he pulls back, his fingers curl

3357
02:59:08,402 --> 02:59:14,621
up into these giant, extremely hard petrified
root-like clusters, and he just starts starts

3358
02:59:14,621 --> 02:59:20,332
whaling on you as you're holding onto that vine.
Three strikes against you.

3359
02:59:20,332 --> 02:59:22,559
The first one is gonna
be a 25.

3360
02:59:22,559 --> 02:59:24,654
TRAVIS: Hits.

3361
02:59:24,654 --> 02:59:26,137
MATT: Second one is a 23.

3362
02:59:26,137 --> 02:59:27,108
TRAVIS: Also hits.

3363
02:59:27,108 --> 02:59:30,379
MATT: Third one is a 15.

3364
02:59:30,379 --> 02:59:32,369
TRAVIS: Misses.

3365
02:59:32,369 --> 02:59:41,429
MATT: It hits you, but just not enough to do any
damage. So, looking at this, that brings it to,

3366
02:59:41,429 --> 02:59:50,956
oh no, that's two. 14 points of bludgeoning
damage on the first one, halved.

3367
02:59:50,956 --> 02:59:52,727
And the second one--

3368
02:59:52,727 --> 02:59:54,913
LAURA: Oh, it's just the fucking coolest.

3369
02:59:54,913 --> 02:59:59,406
MATT: 22 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to
11. I need you to go ahead and make a strength

3370
02:59:59,406 --> 03:00:03,121
saving throw to maintain your hold on that vine.

3371
03:00:03,129 --> 03:00:07,552
As he just bats you around.

3372
03:00:07,552 --> 03:00:09,011
TRAVIS: That's a 21.

3373
03:00:09,011 --> 03:00:13,662
MATT: 21. It punches you twice, and your grip
causes you to slide a foot, but you catch yourself

3374
03:00:13,662 --> 03:00:18,366
and you're still maintaining yourself. The vine is
now swinging from the impact, and you're in the

3375
03:00:18,366 --> 03:00:22,208
process of this weird momentum where you're
passing by a little out of control with your

3376
03:00:22,208 --> 03:00:25,454
movement up in the air of the inside of this
tree.

3377
03:00:25,454 --> 03:00:26,689
TRAVIS: Awesome.

3378
03:00:26,689 --> 03:00:34,639
MATT: So that's gonna end its action. You now
watch as Sondur reaches up and grabs the bow again

3379
03:00:34,639 --> 03:00:41,757
and shifts into the tree to get away from you.
You do get an attack of opportunity, though.

3380
03:00:41,757 --> 03:00:48,499
As you come around, watching him sink in with
your one hand on the axe.

3381
03:00:48,499 --> 03:00:55,277
TRAVIS: Oh, that was so close to being a crit.
That is a 33.

3382
03:00:55,277 --> 03:00:56,861
MATT: (laughs)

3383
03:00:56,861 --> 03:00:58,697
LAURA: 19 isn't a crit for him, right?

3384
03:00:58,697 --> 03:00:59,530
TRAVIS: No.

3385
03:00:59,530 --> 03:01:05,406
MATT: No. So go ahead, I will say the damage is
gonna be a 1d10 rather than a 1d12, just for the

3386
03:01:05,406 --> 03:01:11,226
sake of, you're swinging with one hand.

3387
03:01:11,226 --> 03:01:19,059
TRAVIS: That's... wait, no, that's 22 plus one
point of necrotic damage, so 23.

3388
03:01:19,059 --> 03:01:24,198
MATT: All right, so 23 points of slashing damage
as you come around, as the vine is arcing around,

3389
03:01:24,198 --> 03:01:30,096
whack! You cleave through, catch part of the side
of the shoulder and the jaw. Part of this hard

3390
03:01:30,096 --> 03:01:35,483
bony root exterior actually gets carved off and
you see more black ooze spill out from underneath

3391
03:01:35,483 --> 03:01:44,376
as it shrieks, pulling back into the tree.
You watch him vanish, you're still left there.

3392
03:01:44,376 --> 03:01:45,864
TRAVIS: Killed him.

3393
03:01:45,864 --> 03:01:47,678
LAURA: Good job, Grog.

3394
03:01:47,678 --> 03:01:52,155
LIAM: Smacked him into the wall.

3395
03:01:52,155 --> 03:01:57,784
TRAVIS: Not so tough, really.

3396
03:01:57,784 --> 03:02:06,503
LIAM: Go hide like a potato in the earth.
Oh jeez.

3397
03:02:06,503 --> 03:02:16,871
MATT: As high up as Sondur can get, right at the
edge, actually emerging out of the ceiling portion

3398
03:02:16,871 --> 03:02:21,537
of the top of it, ten feet higher than he was
before, he comes out with Fenthras.

3399
03:02:21,537 --> 03:02:23,632
LAURA: Ten feet higher than he was before?

3400
03:02:23,632 --> 03:02:27,079
MATT: Before, he was out of the wall, before the
ceiling even came up into a cone. He's now coming

3401
03:02:27,079 --> 03:02:28,888
out of the ceiling in another part.

3402
03:02:28,888 --> 03:02:29,934
LAURA: Jeez.

3403
03:02:29,934 --> 03:02:33,507
MATT: Now hanging out halfway and ready to go
ahead and let loose with a bow, that's gonna end

3404
03:02:33,507 --> 03:02:34,655
his turn, however.

3405
03:02:34,655 --> 03:02:37,360
LIAM: How high off the ground is that apex that
he's hanging out of?

3406
03:02:37,360 --> 03:02:39,664
MATT: Right now he's 40 feet up.

3407
03:02:39,664 --> 03:02:41,175
LIAM: 40 feet, all right.

3408
03:02:41,175 --> 03:02:45,611
MATT: Yep. That ends his turn, it is now the
treants' go. They both get up, using half their

3409
03:02:45,611 --> 03:02:54,995
movement. (laughs) Let's see. That one currently
is just being harried with the flames on the

3410
03:02:54,995 --> 03:02:57,586
inside, it takes, does it take any damage on its
turn?

3411
03:02:57,586 --> 03:03:03,967
MARISHA: It does. Unless he douses himself,
he takes another 1d10.

3412
03:03:03,967 --> 03:03:06,855
MATT: Go ahead and do 1d10 damage to him.

3413
03:03:06,855 --> 03:03:10,550
MARISHA: Six.

3414
03:03:10,550 --> 03:03:11,832
TALIESIN: Doubled.

3415
03:03:11,832 --> 03:03:13,452
LAURA: Doubled, yeah.

3416
03:03:13,452 --> 03:03:17,367
MATT: As it begins to take the damage, it begins
to pat out the flames, but as it does, the fire

3417
03:03:17,367 --> 03:03:23,116
just roars into this inferno, and you hear it give
out this creaking, painful (pained groan) as it

3418
03:03:23,116 --> 03:03:27,916
tumbles forward in a timber fashion, the flames
actually burning the life essence out of the

3419
03:03:27,916 --> 03:03:32,868
treant. It falls to the ground, dead, smoldering.

3420
03:03:32,868 --> 03:03:34,646
SAM: Hey, damn!

3421
03:03:34,646 --> 03:03:35,919
TRAVIS: Yes.

3422
03:03:35,919 --> 03:03:40,348
MATT: You pop out of his form as the living entity
is no longer living and you are but an elemental

3423
03:03:40,348 --> 03:03:45,058
now. I'm gonna leave him there just for reference,
because it is a big thing to get through.

3424
03:03:45,058 --> 03:03:49,017
But you are now pushed off to the side.
That treant is gone. The other one gets up and

3425
03:03:49,017 --> 03:03:53,322
steps over to Percy.

3426
03:03:53,322 --> 03:03:54,653
TALIESIN: I made a friend.

3427
03:03:54,653 --> 03:03:57,579
MATT: You did. As you just manage to avoid that,
the treant comes up

3428
03:03:57,579 --> 03:03:59,283
and goes into a double-slam against you.

3429
03:03:59,283 --> 03:04:00,598
LAURA: Fuck.

3430
03:04:00,598 --> 03:04:02,603
MATT: That is gonna be 19.

3431
03:04:02,603 --> 03:04:03,751
TALIESIN: That hits.

3432
03:04:03,751 --> 03:04:05,258
MATT: And 21.

3433
03:04:05,258 --> 03:04:06,734
TALIESIN: That also hits.

3434
03:04:06,734 --> 03:04:12,512
MATT: All righty. You take--

3435
03:04:12,512 --> 03:04:14,058
TALIESIN: I'm fine.

3436
03:04:14,058 --> 03:04:23,875
MATT: 13 points of bludgeoning damage. 20 points
of bludgeoning damage on the second hit.

3437
03:04:23,875 --> 03:04:24,984
LAURA: (gasps)

3438
03:04:24,984 --> 03:04:26,633
TALIESIN: That's mean.

3439
03:04:26,633 --> 03:04:29,734
MATT: It's now pushing you up against the side of
the tree. You can feel the roots hitting the back

3440
03:04:29,734 --> 03:04:35,044
of your head, and as you ricochet off the impact,
you come into another fist right to the face.

3441
03:04:35,044 --> 03:04:39,000
You feel the nose break under the impact and
possibly a tooth get loose as you spit blood out

3442
03:04:39,000 --> 03:04:41,640
the side. It was a rough hit on you.

3443
03:04:41,640 --> 03:04:43,126
TALIESIN: Yeah, that was rough.

3444
03:04:43,126 --> 03:04:47,564
MATT: All right. That ends the treants' turn.
Scanlan and Keyleth, you're up.

3445
03:04:47,564 --> 03:04:51,832
MARISHA: You're still--

3446
03:04:51,832 --> 03:04:55,204
MATT: You're grappled, and currently prone.

3447
03:04:55,204 --> 03:04:56,553
SAM: Okay.

3448
03:04:56,553 --> 03:04:58,388
MARISHA: Where is he? Where are you, Scanlan?

3449
03:04:58,388 --> 03:04:59,770
SAM: I'm against the close side of the wall.

3450
03:04:59,770 --> 03:05:01,106
MATT: You're over there.

3451
03:05:01,106 --> 03:05:03,557
But because your movement is zero and you're
grappled, you cannot get up. So right now you are

3452
03:05:03,557 --> 03:05:05,963
prone and stuck to a wall.

3453
03:05:05,963 --> 03:05:07,984
SAM: Can I pull out a wand, or not even?

3454
03:05:07,984 --> 03:05:10,513
MATT: You can pull out a wand, you're just at
disadvantage for all attacks right now.

3455
03:05:10,513 --> 03:05:12,869
SAM: All attacks. Even spell attacks?

3456
03:05:12,869 --> 03:05:15,893
MATT: You have disadvantage on attack rolls,
and any attack rolls against you have advantage,

3457
03:05:15,893 --> 03:05:19,806
yeah. If they're within five feet of you.
Otherwise they have disadvantage.

3458
03:05:19,806 --> 03:05:21,910
MARISHA: I might be able to try and do something,
if I can go first.

3459
03:05:21,910 --> 03:05:23,925
SAM: That's attack rolls, Fireballs just happen.

3460
03:05:23,925 --> 03:05:24,987
MATT: Correct.

3461
03:05:24,987 --> 03:05:26,926
MARISHA: Maybe I can burn you away.

3462
03:05:26,926 --> 03:05:35,168
SAM: I'll do Fireball on the treant. I'll aim it
far away enough so that it won't hit us.

3463
03:05:35,168 --> 03:05:38,065
Is that a thing? Is that possible?

3464
03:05:38,065 --> 03:05:42,720
MATT: It is, it's hard because you're on the
ground and he's right there.

3465
03:05:42,720 --> 03:05:45,146
SAM: Can I go up?

3466
03:05:45,146 --> 03:05:47,622
LAURA: Can you hit Sondur?

3467
03:05:47,622 --> 03:05:50,367
SAM: Well, yeah, but I don't know how--

3468
03:05:50,367 --> 03:05:54,372
MATT: It's your call. It's a tough circumstance
here, because to hit the treant from your

3469
03:05:54,372 --> 03:05:57,695
perspective, you'd have to hit behind it,
but you have no view behind it

3470
03:05:57,695 --> 03:05:59,022
because you're on the ground.

3471
03:05:59,022 --> 03:06:00,608
SAM: Got it. Got it. All right.

3472
03:06:00,608 --> 03:06:06,521
MATT: I mean, if you want to try that, I'll give
you a roll, and based on how good you roll it may

3473
03:06:06,521 --> 03:06:08,754
or may not hit an ally.

3474
03:06:08,754 --> 03:06:14,867
SAM: Then I will not risk it and I will just
Fireball good old Sondur, I guess.

3475
03:06:14,867 --> 03:06:17,309
MATT: All righty. How many more--

3476
03:06:17,309 --> 03:06:20,058
SAM: I'll use three more charges. I have seven
total.

3477
03:06:20,058 --> 03:06:22,373
MATT: Okay. Seven total left? Or total?

3478
03:06:22,373 --> 03:06:24,507
SAM: Total. So I've used three.

3479
03:06:24,507 --> 03:06:26,820
MATT: Well no, you used five last time.

3480
03:06:26,820 --> 03:06:31,395
SAM: I thought the first one is just three balls?
No? I don't know how this shit works.

3481
03:06:31,395 --> 03:06:33,235
MATT: What does it say on the actual item?

3482
03:06:33,235 --> 03:06:35,740
SAM: I don't have it anymore. I lost it months and
months ago.

3483
03:06:35,740 --> 03:06:38,988
(All laugh.)

3484
03:06:38,988 --> 03:06:44,648
MATT: It's a good thing it's in the Dungeon
Master's Guide. God damn it, Sam. Let me know

3485
03:06:44,648 --> 03:06:48,149
these things, I can get you the item printout.

3486
03:06:48,149 --> 03:06:50,350
LIAM: King of improv. Right here.

3487
03:06:50,350 --> 03:06:54,861
MATT: Okay. Wand of Fireballs, has seven charges.
You can use an action to expend one or more

3488
03:06:54,861 --> 03:06:59,396
charges to cast the Fireball spell. For one
charge, it's the level three, and for each

3489
03:06:59,396 --> 03:07:01,130
additional charge it's more than that. So.

3490
03:07:01,130 --> 03:07:02,741
SAM: So I used three charges.

3491
03:07:02,741 --> 03:07:04,874
MATT: So you used three charges, you have four
charges left, yes.

3492
03:07:04,874 --> 03:07:06,473
SAM: Okay, so I'm gonna use three on him.

3493
03:07:06,473 --> 03:07:09,662
MATT: Oh, three more? All right. Go for it.
That'll be another 10d6.

3494
03:07:09,662 --> 03:07:11,718
TALIESIN: I don't understand how magic works.

3495
03:07:11,718 --> 03:07:13,544
LAURA: I don't know, I don't understand that at
all.

3496
03:07:13,544 --> 03:07:15,209
MATT: We'll see if he makes his saving throw.
It does not make the saving throw, it's gonna use

3497
03:07:15,209 --> 03:07:16,934
its legendary resistance to automatically make
it.

3498
03:07:16,934 --> 03:07:17,564
LAURA: Aw.

3499
03:07:17,564 --> 03:07:18,676
MARISHA: Fucking dick.

3500
03:07:18,676 --> 03:07:19,900
LAURA: Does that half it again?

3501
03:07:19,900 --> 03:07:23,547
MATT: Yeah.

3502
03:07:23,547 --> 03:07:25,573
TRAVIS: I have a question.

3503
03:07:25,573 --> 03:07:27,295
MATT: What's your question, Grog?

3504
03:07:27,295 --> 03:07:30,899
TRAVIS: I forgot about Retaliation. That's a new
feat I have.

3505
03:07:30,899 --> 03:07:33,283
MATT: Yeah, where when it hits you you can use
your reaction, but you used your reaction to get

3506
03:07:33,283 --> 03:07:35,331
an attack of opportunity, so you still hit him.

3507
03:07:35,331 --> 03:07:36,575
TRAVIS: Oh, that's true.

3508
03:07:36,575 --> 03:07:39,621
MATT: But essentially, they don't have to do that
now. As long as they hit you, you can use your

3509
03:07:39,621 --> 03:07:41,336
reaction to just hit them back.

3510
03:07:41,336 --> 03:07:42,688
TRAVIS: Hit them back.

3511
03:07:42,688 --> 03:07:44,040
MATT: So yeah, as long as you stay within melee--

3512
03:07:44,040 --> 03:07:47,981
TRAVIS: As long as I'm within five feet.
That count on his two hits against me?

3513
03:07:47,981 --> 03:07:51,011
MATT: I mean, you can only do it once, because you
only get one reaction.

3514
03:07:51,011 --> 03:07:52,351
TRAVIS: One time. Okay.

3515
03:07:52,351 --> 03:07:54,374
MATT: And you technically already hit him with
that.

3516
03:07:54,374 --> 03:07:55,389
TRAVIS: That's true.

3517
03:07:55,389 --> 03:07:57,260
MATT: Same thing, so you used your attack of
opportunity,

3518
03:07:57,260 --> 03:07:58,832
so you can do that whenever anybody hits you.

3519
03:07:58,832 --> 03:07:59,792
LAURA: See, you're fine.

3520
03:07:59,792 --> 03:08:00,974
MATT: You're good, but good to remember.

3521
03:08:00,974 --> 03:08:01,942
SAM: Laura, are you like...

3522
03:08:01,942 --> 03:08:03,248
LAURA: About to die? Yeah.

3523
03:08:03,248 --> 03:08:04,458
TRAVIS: I haven't used it before.

3524
03:08:04,458 --> 03:08:06,462
SAM: All right, that was 29. So 14.

3525
03:08:06,462 --> 03:08:08,461
MATT: 29. Halve that, 14 points of fire damage.

3526
03:08:08,461 --> 03:08:10,049
LAURA: Like one more hit and I'm unconscious.

3527
03:08:10,049 --> 03:08:12,938
MATT: As another Fireball bursts into the air,
lighting up the room even brighter for an

3528
03:08:12,938 --> 03:08:19,203
instant. You can see now as the smoke clears,
the front of Sondur's form is black and beginning

3529
03:08:19,203 --> 03:08:25,642
to char with each blast of flame. A lot of the oil
has dried off and is now coming off in clumps.

3530
03:08:25,642 --> 03:08:26,997
LAURA: That's good.

3531
03:08:26,997 --> 03:08:28,560
MATT: Almost like dried mud. All right.

3532
03:08:28,560 --> 03:08:34,436
SAM: I will also heal Vex. She's close enough,
right? Yeah? Yeah? Ish?

3533
03:08:34,436 --> 03:08:35,536
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3534
03:08:35,536 --> 03:08:37,056
SAM: With an inspirational quote.

3535
03:08:37,056 --> 03:08:41,076
LAURA: (laughing) No.

3536
03:08:41,076 --> 03:08:43,378
SAM: Something Percival once said a long,
long time ago.

3537
03:08:43,378 --> 03:08:44,671
TALIESIN: Oh no. Oh no.

3538
03:08:44,671 --> 03:08:45,450
LAURA: I'm ready.

3539
03:08:45,450 --> 03:08:49,397
SAM: Life needs things to live. That's it.
That's the whole quote.

3540
03:08:49,397 --> 03:08:52,338
(All laugh.)

3541
03:08:52,338 --> 03:08:58,954
SAM: Earlier tonight. Percival von Fredrickstein
von Rollo de Frankenstein de Roll.

3542
03:08:58,954 --> 03:09:01,989
Credit where credit is due.

3543
03:09:01,989 --> 03:09:03,690
LIAM: Put it on a kitten poster.

3544
03:09:03,690 --> 03:09:05,915
SAM: Oh, and I'll do it at level three, so that's,

3545
03:09:05,915 --> 03:09:08,453
sorry, not inspiration, healing, healing, healing.

3546
03:09:08,453 --> 03:09:09,399
LAURA: Oh, okay.

3547
03:09:09,399 --> 03:09:11,160
MATT: That's right, this is a healing spell,
all right.

3548
03:09:11,160 --> 03:09:14,671
SAM: So that's 3d4 plus six.

3549
03:09:14,671 --> 03:09:17,021
MARISHA: Oh man.

3550
03:09:17,021 --> 03:09:17,901
SAM: 12.

3551
03:09:17,901 --> 03:09:19,336
LAURA: Okay, thank you!

3552
03:09:19,336 --> 03:09:21,160
TALIESIN: 12 helps.

3553
03:09:21,160 --> 03:09:22,659
MATT: All right, Keyleth.

3554
03:09:22,659 --> 03:09:31,037
MARISHA: Okay. I am going to march over to that,
oh man, to that guy.

3555
03:09:31,037 --> 03:09:32,823
TALIESIN: Number two?

3556
03:09:32,823 --> 03:09:34,314
MARISHA: Number two. Treant number two.

3557
03:09:34,314 --> 03:09:35,607
MATT: All right.

3558
03:09:35,607 --> 03:09:40,636
MARISHA: I want to see if I can Tree Stride
through him--

3559
03:09:40,636 --> 03:09:43,200
MATT: Did you take damage from the fall earlier?

3560
03:09:43,200 --> 03:09:44,135
MARISHA: I did.

3561
03:09:44,135 --> 03:09:45,635
MATT: Make a concentration check.

3562
03:09:45,635 --> 03:09:47,310
SAM: (sings a note)

3563
03:09:47,310 --> 03:09:49,126
MARISHA: Even though I have resistance on
bludgeoning damage and all that shit?

3564
03:09:49,126 --> 03:09:53,559
MATT: Yeah. So just add your constitution
modifier.

3565
03:09:53,559 --> 03:09:55,221
MARISHA: Oh, my constitution modifier? As a--

3566
03:09:55,221 --> 03:09:58,391
MATT: As a fire elemental.

3567
03:09:58,391 --> 03:09:59,616
MARISHA: Just my modifier?

3568
03:09:59,616 --> 03:10:00,298
MATT: Yes.

3569
03:10:00,298 --> 03:10:01,175
MARISHA: Eight.

3570
03:10:01,175 --> 03:10:02,882
MATT: Yeah, so Tree Stride has faded. Sorry.

3571
03:10:02,882 --> 03:10:05,582
MARISHA: Fuck!

3572
03:10:05,582 --> 03:10:11,574
MATT: Concentration spells when you take damage,
man.

3573
03:10:11,574 --> 03:10:17,802
MARISHA: Well, I still whelm him. That guy in
front of me. I still can move into his space.

3574
03:10:17,802 --> 03:10:23,524
MATT: Into his space. Go ahead and make your
attacks.

3575
03:10:23,524 --> 03:10:28,572
MARISHA: That's my fucking opal dice again.
Asshole. Oh look, and that was 18.

3576
03:10:28,572 --> 03:10:29,987
SAM: You gotta roll it angry.

3577
03:10:29,987 --> 03:10:31,681
LAURA: Oh, maybe that's the key.

3578
03:10:31,681 --> 03:10:32,776
TALIESIN: Maybe you have to roll it angry.

3579
03:10:32,776 --> 03:10:34,129
TRAVIS: You're being so fucking nice.

3580
03:10:34,129 --> 03:10:35,002
TALIESIN: Angry die.

3581
03:10:35,002 --> 03:10:36,490
LIAM: But she's always angry.

3582
03:10:36,490 --> 03:10:37,659
LAURA: Just like "arrgh" every time you roll it.

3583
03:10:37,659 --> 03:10:40,057
MATT: Keyleth must embrace her anger to actually
make the dice work for her. I like that.

3584
03:10:40,057 --> 03:10:41,484
MARISHA: Two slam attacks.

3585
03:10:41,484 --> 03:10:43,961
LAURA: See, that's Taliesin's secret, he's always
angry.

3586
03:10:43,961 --> 03:10:47,044
TALIESIN: Always angry.

3587
03:10:47,044 --> 03:10:48,796
MATT: Are you rolling with advantage?

3588
03:10:48,796 --> 03:10:50,326
MARISHA: Do I roll with advantage?

3589
03:10:50,326 --> 03:10:51,325
MATT: No.

3590
03:10:51,325 --> 03:10:52,353
MARISHA: No.

3591
03:10:52,353 --> 03:10:55,605
MATT: Sorry, I saw you roll two dice, so I...
those are both attacks at once? Got you.

3592
03:10:55,605 --> 03:10:57,524
MARISHA: No, I'm rolling my three dice.

3593
03:10:57,524 --> 03:10:58,992
SAM: Two slam attacks, right?

3594
03:10:58,992 --> 03:11:00,609
MATT: You have two slam attacks. Did you roll to
hit on those?

3595
03:11:00,609 --> 03:11:02,238
MARISHA: Oh, wait, no, I don't think I did.

3596
03:11:02,238 --> 03:11:03,322
MATT: That's what I'm asking.

3597
03:11:03,322 --> 03:11:04,410
MARISHA: I forgot that part.

3598
03:11:04,410 --> 03:11:06,244
MATT: Do that first.

3599
03:11:06,244 --> 03:11:10,966
MARISHA: Oh, man. Two 11s. Which, 17 to hit both
times.

3600
03:11:10,966 --> 03:11:11,905
SAM: Make a wish.

3601
03:11:11,905 --> 03:11:12,872
MATT: Both hit.

3602
03:11:12,872 --> 03:11:20,484
MARISHA: Okay, so the first one, um. 15 for the
first one.

3603
03:11:20,484 --> 03:11:24,577
MATT: Okay.

3604
03:11:24,577 --> 03:11:26,475
LAURA: All the big ones, they just--

3605
03:11:26,475 --> 03:11:27,645
TRAVIS: Love it.

3606
03:11:27,645 --> 03:11:29,364
LAURA: They're pretty but--

3607
03:11:29,364 --> 03:11:33,026
MARISHA: And another 15 for the second one.

3608
03:11:33,026 --> 03:11:34,275
LAURA: Why would you do that?

3609
03:11:34,275 --> 03:11:38,807
MATT: And for the first one, it was...

3610
03:11:38,807 --> 03:11:41,060
TALIESIN: That don't suck. And then he's on fire
now, right?

3611
03:11:41,060 --> 03:11:44,483
MARISHA: He's on fire. Oh, and he takes another
d10 because I moved into his space.

3612
03:11:44,483 --> 03:11:45,456
MATT: Yeah.

3613
03:11:45,456 --> 03:11:47,118
LAURA: Oh, good good good, that's good.

3614
03:11:47,118 --> 03:11:48,198
MATT: And he's on fire.

3615
03:11:48,198 --> 03:11:50,450
MARISHA: So another four points from me.

3616
03:11:50,450 --> 03:11:52,221
SAM: (softly sings along with the background
music)

3617
03:11:52,221 --> 03:11:54,178
MATT: All righty. The flames burn up into his
form, he starts shrieking as the flame starts

3618
03:11:54,178 --> 03:11:59,352
curling up its body, it does not like being on
fire. That end your turn?

3619
03:11:59,352 --> 03:12:00,845
MARISHA: Yeah.

3620
03:12:00,845 --> 03:12:09,287
MATT: All righty. At the end of your turn,
Sondur is gonna go ahead and--

3621
03:12:09,287 --> 03:12:11,903
SAM: I'm just gonna go ahead and borrow this.
Possibly permanently.

3622
03:12:11,903 --> 03:12:12,894
TALIESIN: God damn it.

3623
03:12:12,894 --> 03:12:14,355
MATT: Is gonna cast another spell.

3624
03:12:14,355 --> 03:12:16,900
TRAVIS: Over here, you piece of shit. Nope.

3625
03:12:16,900 --> 03:12:20,892
LAURA: Anything?

3626
03:12:20,892 --> 03:12:23,995
TRAVIS: I cough weakly.

3627
03:12:23,995 --> 03:12:27,103
MATT: The bow's held aloft, he looks down and sees
you on the ground, Vex.

3628
03:12:27,103 --> 03:12:28,279
LAURA: Ow.

3629
03:12:28,279 --> 03:12:32,209
MATT: And just extends his fingers and says,
"You had your choice."

3630
03:12:32,283 --> 03:12:34,609
Make a constitution saving throw.

3631
03:12:34,609 --> 03:12:39,789
LAURA: Oh, good. 20.

3632
03:12:39,789 --> 03:12:42,136
MATT: 20? Success.

3633
03:12:42,136 --> 03:12:44,093
(All cheer.)

3634
03:12:44,093 --> 03:12:45,821
MATT: So you take half damage.

3635
03:12:45,821 --> 03:12:48,008
SAM: Half damage? Wait, what? No damage!

3636
03:12:48,008 --> 03:12:49,904
MARISHA: That sounded like a lot of dice.

3637
03:12:49,904 --> 03:12:51,261
LAURA: That's a lot of dice.

3638
03:12:51,261 --> 03:12:52,595
LIAM: That's a fucking miracle is what that is.

3639
03:12:52,595 --> 03:12:57,648
TALIESIN: That sounds like a handful of hate.
That was like four dice.

3640
03:12:57,648 --> 03:13:01,962
TRAVIS: It's okay, they're all d1s.

3641
03:13:01,962 --> 03:13:06,146
MATT: 31 halved... you take 16 points of necrotic
damage.

3642
03:13:06,146 --> 03:13:08,051
TALIESIN: You're good.

3643
03:13:08,051 --> 03:13:09,749
MARISHA: You all right? Still up.

3644
03:13:09,749 --> 03:13:11,321
MATT: As the Blight spell takes over--

3645
03:13:11,321 --> 03:13:12,152
SAM: Whoa.

3646
03:13:12,152 --> 03:13:16,609
MATT: -- you feel the vines wrap around you and
the life force pulled from your form momentarily.

3647
03:13:16,609 --> 03:13:21,631
Suddenly they crack and break as you shove them
off, the air pulled from your lungs, and you gasp

3648
03:13:21,631 --> 03:13:25,545
for air, holding onto that last little sliver of
life you still have.

3649
03:13:25,545 --> 03:13:27,229
MARISHA: Two can play at that game, motherfucker.

3650
03:13:27,229 --> 03:13:28,650
TALIESIN: You need healing.

3651
03:13:28,650 --> 03:13:31,087
MATT: All righty. Now it's your turn, Vex.

3652
03:13:31,087 --> 03:13:32,248
LAURA: Now it's my turn.

3653
03:13:32,248 --> 03:13:33,244
MATT: Yes.

3654
03:13:33,244 --> 03:13:36,101
LAURA: Okay. I'm gonna take, can I--

3655
03:13:36,101 --> 03:13:37,974
MATT: You're still prone on the ground, by the
way.

3656
03:13:37,974 --> 03:13:39,031
LAURA: I stand up.

3657
03:13:39,031 --> 03:13:41,306
MATT: All right, so that's half your movement.

3658
03:13:41,306 --> 03:13:43,887
LAURA: Can I take a greater healing potion?

3659
03:13:43,887 --> 03:13:45,134
MATT: You can.

3660
03:13:45,134 --> 03:13:46,046
LAURA: As a bonus?

3661
03:13:46,046 --> 03:13:46,986
MATT: Yep.

3662
03:13:46,986 --> 03:13:48,537
LAURA: How much is that?

3663
03:13:48,537 --> 03:13:52,583
MATT: Greater healing would be 4d4 plus four.

3664
03:13:52,583 --> 03:14:03,663
LAURA: Okay. 11 plus four is 15. Okay.

3665
03:14:03,663 --> 03:14:05,996
SAM: Okay, okay.

3666
03:14:05,996 --> 03:14:07,736
TRAVIS: It's that hit back.

3667
03:14:07,736 --> 03:14:16,897
LAURA: Okay, that's good, that's good. 37, okay.
Okay. I guess I will,

3668
03:14:16,897 --> 03:14:20,452
his Hunter's Mark is still on him, right?

3669
03:14:20,452 --> 03:14:24,037
MATT: Actually, you should make a concentration
check because of the Blight damage, which I forgot

3670
03:14:24,037 --> 03:14:27,671
to take as far as the fall damage earlier as well,
so make two concentration checks.

3671
03:14:27,671 --> 03:14:28,805
LAURA: Cool.

3672
03:14:28,805 --> 03:14:30,757
MATT: Yeah, so add your constitution modifier.

3673
03:14:30,757 --> 03:14:31,800
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yeah.

3674
03:14:31,800 --> 03:14:35,441
LAURA: 19 for the first. And a natural one for the
second.

3675
03:14:35,441 --> 03:14:37,074
MATT: Yeah, no, that's faded, sorry.

3676
03:14:37,074 --> 03:14:41,623
LAURA: Okay, cool. Okay, so--

3677
03:14:41,623 --> 03:14:45,855
MATT: Actually, Percy, I need you to make a
concentration check as well.

3678
03:14:45,855 --> 03:14:47,796
I need to get better at that.

3679
03:14:47,796 --> 03:14:52,596
LAURA: I guess for my-- Jesus Christ.

3680
03:14:52,596 --> 03:14:55,282
MATT: Two, one for each slam.

3681
03:14:55,282 --> 03:14:56,802
TALIESIN: It's a constitution?

3682
03:14:56,802 --> 03:14:59,511
MATT: Yeah, add your constitution modifier.

3683
03:14:59,511 --> 03:15:00,508
TALIESIN: Ten.

3684
03:15:00,508 --> 03:15:02,052
MATT: Yeah, so the Hex has also faded, sorry.

3685
03:15:02,052 --> 03:15:03,232
TALIESIN: Damn it.

3686
03:15:03,232 --> 03:15:08,880
LAURA: Fuck. I guess I'm gonna Hail of Thorns
him.

3687
03:15:08,880 --> 03:15:10,898
MATT: Okay, go for it.

3688
03:15:10,898 --> 03:15:12,518
TRAVIS: Well, tit-for-tat, give him something
else.

3689
03:15:12,518 --> 03:15:13,358
LAURA: Right?

3690
03:15:13,358 --> 03:15:14,566
TALIESIN: Just hurt him, just hurt him.

3691
03:15:14,566 --> 03:15:15,674
SAM: Yeah, man.

3692
03:15:15,674 --> 03:15:18,381
LAURA: Okay, so that's a regular attack.

3693
03:15:18,381 --> 03:15:19,985
MATT: What level are you casting it at?

3694
03:15:19,985 --> 03:15:22,317
LAURA: Oh! Right, oh, I can cast it at higher.

3695
03:15:22,317 --> 03:15:23,491
MATT: Yes you can.

3696
03:15:23,491 --> 03:15:25,398
LAURA: I'm gonna cast it at a level four.
Fuck it.

3697
03:15:25,398 --> 03:15:27,768
MATT: Go for it! So go ahead and roll the attack.

3698
03:15:27,768 --> 03:15:34,289
LAURA: Okay, that is... I roll a d20 and then I
add what? My spell attack bonus?

3699
03:15:34,289 --> 03:15:37,220
MATT: No, it's just a regular attack, and if it
hits-- because you cast the spell as a bonus

3700
03:15:37,220 --> 03:15:39,994
action onto an arrow, release the arrow,
and if it hits--

3701
03:15:39,994 --> 03:15:41,426
LAURA: 27.

3702
03:15:41,426 --> 03:15:47,269
MATT: 27 hits. So you do damage for the arrow,
plus an additional 4d10 damage, yeah.

3703
03:15:47,269 --> 03:15:48,573
LAURA: 4d10.

3704
03:15:48,573 --> 03:15:49,743
LIAM: Girl!

3705
03:15:49,743 --> 03:15:55,270
LAURA: That's good, that's good, that's good.
Oh, that's good, okay. 17 for the actual hit.

3706
03:15:55,270 --> 03:15:56,238
MATT: Nice.

3707
03:15:56,238 --> 03:15:58,335
LAURA: And then an additional 4d10?

3708
03:15:58,335 --> 03:15:59,235
MATT: Yep.

3709
03:15:59,235 --> 03:16:10,743
LAURA: Wow. That's awesome. Hopefully these will
be good. 20 additional.

3710
03:16:10,743 --> 03:16:14,883
MATT: 20 points of damage to him. Nice. As you
release the arrow, it sticks into his chest.

3711
03:16:14,883 --> 03:16:18,586
(chuckles) "You will--" (explosion sound)

3712
03:16:18,586 --> 03:16:21,034
It just
bursts in his chest, these thorns go spraying into

3713
03:16:21,034 --> 03:16:24,935
him and the nearby area, just like a pipe bomb
went off in his chest, and he's just like

3714
03:16:24,935 --> 03:16:32,411
(gasping roar of pain). All right. And do you want
to move or stay where you are?

3715
03:16:32,411 --> 03:16:34,775
LAURA: I'm gonna stay where I am.

3716
03:16:34,775 --> 03:16:35,559
MATT: Okay.

3717
03:16:35,559 --> 03:16:37,925
LAURA: But I'm gonna hold onto that tree.

3718
03:16:37,925 --> 03:16:41,256
MATT: Okay, you grapple onto that tree. End of
your turn, he's gonna use his last legendary

3719
03:16:41,256 --> 03:16:51,167
action to make one attack with Fenthras back at
you out of anger. That is a 25.

3720
03:16:51,167 --> 03:16:52,513
LAURA: That hits me.

3721
03:16:52,513 --> 03:16:54,302
MATT: All right.

3722
03:16:54,302 --> 03:16:56,765
SAM: I'm gonna actually, wait, can I Cutting Words
that?

3723
03:16:56,765 --> 03:16:58,711
MATT: Sure. What are you gonna do? What do you
say?

3724
03:16:58,711 --> 03:16:59,736
MARISHA: C'mon, c'mon.

3725
03:16:59,736 --> 03:17:05,923
SAM: I'm gonna insult him. I'm gonna call him a
(clears throat)

3726
03:17:05,923 --> 03:17:11,155
"Oi, you fobbing elf-skinned flapdragon!

3727
03:17:11,155 --> 03:17:19,063
"You paunchy ill-breeding lewdster! You
unmuscled reeling ripe mumblenews!"

3728
03:17:19,063 --> 03:17:21,291
Shakespeare insult generator.

3729
03:17:21,291 --> 03:17:22,895
MATT: That is fantastic.

3730
03:17:22,895 --> 03:17:25,243
TRAVIS: That's unbelievable.

3731
03:17:25,243 --> 03:17:26,619
MATT: That's really quite good.

3732
03:17:26,619 --> 03:17:29,047
LAURA: He's really old, so that really means a lot
to him.

3733
03:17:29,047 --> 03:17:32,984
MATT: Unfortunately, they fall on deaf ears,
he's beyond 60 feet from you,

3734
03:17:32,984 --> 03:17:34,656
and doesn't hear the insult.

3735
03:17:34,656 --> 03:17:37,560
SAM: What? I thought the roof was only like 45
feet up, 50 feet up!

3736
03:17:37,560 --> 03:17:39,229
MATT: But you're over there.

3737
03:17:39,229 --> 03:17:44,930
SAM: I yelled it really loud.

3738
03:17:44,930 --> 03:17:47,457
TALIESIN: Did you use the cone? No, you can't use
the-- oh, you could use the cone.

3739
03:17:47,457 --> 03:17:55,056
MATT: Just on the cusp. At an angle, let me see
here, 'cause he's about 55 feet from you and then

3740
03:17:55,056 --> 03:17:58,627
is 40 feet up, yeah, at the angle, he's just out
of range.

3741
03:17:58,627 --> 03:18:02,233
MARISHA: Aw, Pythagoras's theorem, man, c'mon,
that's right at 60, right?

3742
03:18:02,233 --> 03:18:04,345
MATT: Just misses him.

3743
03:18:04,345 --> 03:18:09,012
MARISHA: A-squared plus b-squared equals
c-squared? C'mon.

3744
03:18:09,012 --> 03:18:10,615
SAM: No problem.

3745
03:18:10,615 --> 03:18:14,261
MATT: Yeah, he's just out of the range. You shout
it, it echoes, it was a great insult, but he's too

3746
03:18:14,261 --> 03:18:16,037
focused--

3747
03:18:16,037 --> 03:18:16,945
LAURA: Fuck.

3748
03:18:16,945 --> 03:18:21,136
MATT: -- and looses the arrow. It manages to catch
you for...

3749
03:18:21,136 --> 03:18:26,557
TALIESIN: Oh, don't make that face.

3750
03:18:26,557 --> 03:18:29,172
MATT: 15 points of piercing damage and one point
of lightning damage.

3751
03:18:29,172 --> 03:18:30,755
LAURA: Okay. Okay.

3752
03:18:30,755 --> 03:18:31,653
MARISHA: Still up?

3753
03:18:31,653 --> 03:18:32,722
LAURA: I'm good.

3754
03:18:32,722 --> 03:18:33,598
TALIESIN: Ish.

3755
03:18:33,598 --> 03:18:34,677
LAURA: Ish.

3756
03:18:34,677 --> 03:18:36,093
TALIESIN: Esque.

3757
03:18:36,093 --> 03:18:38,195
MATT: All right. Up at the top of the round.
Vax, you're up.

3758
03:18:38,195 --> 03:18:41,689
LIAM: All right, I think from where I'm standing
I'm close enough to see that Keyleth is absolutely

3759
03:18:41,689 --> 03:18:44,354
mauling the tree, she's right on top of it,
right?

3760
03:18:44,354 --> 03:18:45,880
MATT: That appears to be the case, yes.

3761
03:18:45,880 --> 03:18:47,386
LIAM: With double speed I can get there, yeah?

3762
03:18:47,386 --> 03:18:49,005
MATT: Yes, you can.

3763
03:18:49,005 --> 03:18:52,474
LIAM: All right, so I'm gonna flit across the
floor, come up right behind Keyleth, shoot right

3764
03:18:52,474 --> 03:18:57,197
around the side of her and stab up and in,
one-two-three.

3765
03:18:57,197 --> 03:18:59,914
MATT: Go for it.

3766
03:18:59,914 --> 03:19:04,676
LIAM: First attack is a 28.

3767
03:19:04,676 --> 03:19:06,446
MATT: 28 hits.

3768
03:19:06,446 --> 03:19:09,156
LIAM: Second attack is a 29.

3769
03:19:09,156 --> 03:19:10,263
MATT: Hits.

3770
03:19:10,263 --> 03:19:12,455
LIAM: And the third attack is a 26.

3771
03:19:12,455 --> 03:19:14,767
MATT: Hits, all three hit.

3772
03:19:14,767 --> 03:19:25,786
LIAM: Sneak attack on the first. Two plus six is
eight... 30.

3773
03:19:25,786 --> 03:19:26,951
MATT: 30 points.

3774
03:19:26,951 --> 03:19:31,806
LIAM: For the first attack, second attack does
seven, and the third attack does ten.

3775
03:19:31,806 --> 03:19:33,772
MATT: Ten, all righty.

3776
03:19:33,772 --> 03:19:35,256
LIAM: Ten and seven.

3777
03:19:35,256 --> 03:19:38,775
MATT: You rush up from the side, seeing the
inferno engulfing the creature as it's shrieking

3778
03:19:38,775 --> 03:19:42,914
in pain, you rush up and just start stabbing it
repeatedly, throwing your dagger up into the

3779
03:19:42,914 --> 03:19:47,604
various exposed parts of its bark form. You can
see it's actually breaking apart from the inside.

3780
03:19:47,604 --> 03:19:50,389
It's still holding itself together, but it's
looking pretty rough.

3781
03:19:50,389 --> 03:19:54,142
LIAM: Am I burning at all, as I just came up next
to flamey here?

3782
03:19:54,142 --> 03:19:56,355
MATT: What's the radius, Keyleth?

3783
03:19:56,355 --> 03:19:57,713
LAURA: On fire damage.

3784
03:19:57,713 --> 03:20:00,493
MATT: What's the radius to take damage? When they
come within a certain area of you?

3785
03:20:00,493 --> 03:20:03,009
MARISHA: No, it's when I'm--

3786
03:20:03,009 --> 03:20:04,397
TALIESIN: Sharing space.

3787
03:20:04,397 --> 03:20:11,158
MARISHA: Five feet, maybe? Wait. I think it's when
I'm sharing space.

3788
03:20:11,158 --> 03:20:13,090
LIAM: Because that came up in the past, being
around her.

3789
03:20:13,090 --> 03:20:15,259
MATT: No, you're right, it doesn't affect,
you're fine, you're fine.

3790
03:20:15,259 --> 03:20:16,080
LIAM: Woo!

3791
03:20:16,080 --> 03:20:19,728
MATT: You're good. You can feel the heat,
it's emanating from it, definitely. All right.

3792
03:20:19,728 --> 03:20:21,376
That end your turn, Vax?

3793
03:20:21,376 --> 03:20:22,072
LIAM: Yeah.

3794
03:20:22,072 --> 03:20:23,502
MATT: Percy, you're up.

3795
03:20:23,502 --> 03:20:25,691
TALIESIN: I just watch this. I put my gun down,
pull out my sword,

3796
03:20:25,691 --> 03:20:27,338
and just start hacking at the tree.

3797
03:20:27,338 --> 03:20:29,734
MATT: Go for it.

3798
03:20:29,734 --> 03:20:31,265
SAM: What happened?

3799
03:20:31,265 --> 03:20:33,423
TALIESIN: That's 25.

3800
03:20:33,423 --> 03:20:35,085
MATT: 25 hits.

3801
03:20:35,085 --> 03:20:37,323
TALIESIN: 23.

3802
03:20:37,323 --> 03:20:40,291
MATT: Hits.

3803
03:20:40,291 --> 03:20:42,417
TALIESIN: And 27.

3804
03:20:42,417 --> 03:20:49,485
MATT: Hits. All three hit.

3805
03:20:49,485 --> 03:20:52,987
(A dice clings loudly against a glass.)

3806
03:20:52,987 --> 03:20:57,812
TALIESIN: That's a thing that happens now.
Okay, and so that's...

3807
03:20:57,812 --> 03:20:59,648
(Travis elbows the set, which makes a loud thump
noise)

3808
03:20:59,648 --> 03:21:03,167
TRAVIS: Jesus. Thunder strikes outside the tree.

3809
03:21:03,167 --> 03:21:04,523
LIAM: What was that?

3810
03:21:04,523 --> 03:21:06,309
LAURA: That was Travis hitting the side of the
room.

3811
03:21:06,309 --> 03:21:08,877
TRAVIS: I'm too big for this world.

3812
03:21:08,877 --> 03:21:10,599
TALIESIN: 35 points of slashing damage.

3813
03:21:10,599 --> 03:21:11,971
MATT: On the first hit? Rolled together?

3814
03:21:11,971 --> 03:21:12,926
TALIESIN: All three together.

3815
03:21:12,926 --> 03:21:13,849
MATT: I was like, holy shit.

3816
03:21:13,849 --> 03:21:14,890
TALIESIN: Yeah, I just went thump-thump-thump.

3817
03:21:14,890 --> 03:21:16,146
MATT: Yeah.

3818
03:21:16,146 --> 03:21:17,695
TRAVIS: You're a greater barbarian than I am.

3819
03:21:17,695 --> 03:21:20,821
MATT: As it's on fire and shrieking, you pull the
sword out and, seeing the wounds that Vax already

3820
03:21:20,821 --> 03:21:26,512
left open, you leap up off of one knee, leap up,
spin it around, and jam it into the center where

3821
03:21:26,512 --> 03:21:29,273
you see the bark is actually splitting, and with
that, you look down at Keyleth, and together,

3822
03:21:29,273 --> 03:21:33,159
she forces outward as you dig down with the
blade. The treant actually splits up the middle

3823
03:21:33,159 --> 03:21:38,476
and then just falls to two sides and begins to
burn from the inside.

3824
03:21:38,476 --> 03:21:39,729
SAM: It's looking pretty rough.

3825
03:21:39,729 --> 03:21:43,016
(All laugh.)

3826
03:21:43,016 --> 03:21:44,445
MARISHA: Is he dead? He's dead.

3827
03:21:44,445 --> 03:21:45,510
LAURA: That's good, that's good.

3828
03:21:45,510 --> 03:21:47,002
MATT: He is dead and on the ground there,
just burning.

3829
03:21:47,002 --> 03:21:49,235
SAM: Loot the body. Might get some acorns.

3830
03:21:49,235 --> 03:21:50,379
LAURA: So much lumber.

3831
03:21:50,379 --> 03:21:52,408
MARISHA: Let's make s'mores after this!

3832
03:21:52,408 --> 03:21:54,082
MATT: Percy, do you want to move or do you stay
where you are?

3833
03:21:54,082 --> 03:21:59,928
TALIESIN: I'm going to move, I'm going to charge
north, just to split the group up a bit.

3834
03:21:59,928 --> 03:22:01,024
MATT: Over here?

3835
03:22:01,024 --> 03:22:05,324
TALIESIN: Yeah, actually if I can hug the edge a
little closer--

3836
03:22:05,324 --> 03:22:07,061
MATT: Like there, or around this way, you mean?

3837
03:22:07,061 --> 03:22:08,977
TALIESIN: Around that way, and then ten feet away
from the wall.

3838
03:22:08,977 --> 03:22:11,763
MATT: Ten feet away.

3839
03:22:11,763 --> 03:22:15,989
TALIESIN: And then, bonus action to put my mask on
in case anything more gassy happens.

3840
03:22:15,989 --> 03:22:16,929
MATT: Okay.

3841
03:22:16,929 --> 03:22:22,095
TALIESIN: And then I've got a grit left,
so fuck it, I'm gonna-- oh no, because I can't

3842
03:22:22,095 --> 03:22:25,968
switch weapons fast enough. Never mind. I'm gonna
call it.

3843
03:22:25,968 --> 03:22:27,588
LIAM: I have a question, and I could be wrong--

3844
03:22:27,588 --> 03:22:28,486
MATT: Yes?

3845
03:22:28,486 --> 03:22:30,314
LIAM: I thought Percy gave me that mask.

3846
03:22:30,314 --> 03:22:32,441
TALIESIN: I took it back from you last game.

3847
03:22:32,441 --> 03:22:33,789
MATT: He did.

3848
03:22:33,789 --> 03:22:35,205
LIAM: Oh right, I forgot.

3849
03:22:35,205 --> 03:22:36,808
TALIESIN: 'Cause you weren't there.

3850
03:22:36,808 --> 03:22:39,411
MATT: You weren't there and he was walking through
the swamp, yeah.

3851
03:22:39,411 --> 03:22:40,643
LIAM: That is true.

3852
03:22:40,643 --> 03:22:43,221
TALIESIN: Yeah, you can have it back if you want,
I just took it for the swamp.

3853
03:22:43,221 --> 03:22:45,838
LIAM: Nah, it looks good on you.

3854
03:22:45,838 --> 03:22:47,709
MATT: It's now count 20.

3855
03:22:47,709 --> 03:22:52,592
LAURA: Any sign of umber-werewolfy--

3856
03:22:52,592 --> 03:22:53,540
TRAVIS: Ukurat.

3857
03:22:53,540 --> 03:22:54,766
LAURA: Ukurat?

3858
03:22:54,766 --> 03:23:06,941
MATT: So. First you watch as a low mist begins to
slowly filter into the room. Everyone in this

3859
03:23:06,941 --> 03:23:11,759
radius here, it's gonna be Keyleth, Vax, Percy,
and Vex,

3860
03:23:11,759 --> 03:23:14,798
I need you all to make a wisdom saving throw.

3861
03:23:14,798 --> 03:23:16,944
SAM: Oh.

3862
03:23:16,944 --> 03:23:17,999
MARISHA: Wisdom.

3863
03:23:17,999 --> 03:23:19,396
MATT: Yes, as the fog fills the--

3864
03:23:19,396 --> 03:23:20,899
LAURA: Natural 20!

3865
03:23:20,899 --> 03:23:22,029
TALIESIN: 19.

3866
03:23:22,029 --> 03:23:23,149
SAM: Wow.

3867
03:23:23,149 --> 03:23:24,200
LIAM: Best wisdom roll of my life.

3868
03:23:24,200 --> 03:23:25,719
SAM: What'd you get, Liam?

3869
03:23:25,719 --> 03:23:27,247
LIAM: 21, which was huge for me.

3870
03:23:27,247 --> 03:23:28,168
MATT: 21.

3871
03:23:28,168 --> 03:23:29,277
LAURA: Natural 20.

3872
03:23:29,277 --> 03:23:31,674
MARISHA: 18 plus 11, so 29.

3873
03:23:31,674 --> 03:23:32,941
TALIESIN: 23.

3874
03:23:32,941 --> 03:23:34,674
MATT: Jesus Christ.

3875
03:23:34,674 --> 03:23:36,122
TRAVIS: It's just on that smog thing.

3876
03:23:36,122 --> 03:23:40,297
MATT: You feel like the fog as it fills your
senses begins to cloud your mind and your vision

3877
03:23:40,297 --> 03:23:44,149
begins to blur, but then you shake it from your
mind and focus in and it has no effect on you.

3878
03:23:44,149 --> 03:23:46,268
LAURA: Yes!

3879
03:23:46,268 --> 03:23:51,356
MATT: Lot of fucking help that did. At which
point, the area that it closed before, where you

3880
03:23:51,356 --> 03:23:55,969
guys entered, you hear this loud creaking sound
and the breaking of wood and bark.

3881
03:23:55,969 --> 03:23:57,020
TALIESIN: Yeah!

3882
03:23:57,020 --> 03:24:00,652
MATT: Suddenly you watch as it's forced open as
these two feral claws (growls).

3883
03:24:00,652 --> 03:24:03,414
(All cheer.)

3884
03:24:03,414 --> 03:24:11,403
MATT: And Ukurat darts inside from the entrance.
Looks around, looks up. "Where's my quarry?"

3885
03:24:11,403 --> 03:24:13,644
LAURA: Up, up, up!

3886
03:24:13,644 --> 03:24:20,173
MATT: Looks up and sees Sondur. "So be it." 
And begins jumping onto the wall and climbing

3887
03:24:20,173 --> 03:24:23,194
and running up the side of the actual--

3888
03:24:23,194 --> 03:24:24,826
TALIESIN: Parkour.

3889
03:24:24,826 --> 03:24:26,375
MATT: Parkour, indeed.

3890
03:24:26,375 --> 03:24:30,538
SAM: You could cut me out first! Okay, just go,
it's okay.

3891
03:24:30,538 --> 03:24:33,830
MATT: Gets up and runs, and he only manages to get
just up to

3892
03:24:33,830 --> 03:24:37,790
where we'll say where Sondur is there
in his turn.

3893
03:24:37,790 --> 03:24:39,312
LAURA: Look at how big they both are.

3894
03:24:39,312 --> 03:24:42,664
MATT: But he's now right up in the face of Sondur.
Sondur's like, (grunts).

3895
03:24:42,664 --> 03:24:44,315
SAM: Sic 'em.

3896
03:24:44,315 --> 03:24:47,315
MATT: All right, that ends his turn, 20, Grog,
you're up.

3897
03:24:47,315 --> 03:24:51,607
TRAVIS: I've been so taken out of this fight,
it's driving me crazy. I'm hanging from vines,

3898
03:24:51,607 --> 03:24:55,063
I see Wolfman come up, I'm not gonna be left out
of this.

3899
03:24:55,063 --> 03:24:57,836
Can I try and Tarzan my way over into the
fray?

3900
03:24:57,836 --> 03:25:00,117
All: Yes!

3901
03:25:00,117 --> 03:25:03,638
MATT: Yes. This will be the majority of your
movement and your action to do so.

3902
03:25:03,638 --> 03:25:05,209
TRAVIS: Just get me there, baby.

3903
03:25:05,209 --> 03:25:08,172
MATT: All right. So you, go ahead and make an
athletics check.

3904
03:25:08,172 --> 03:25:09,830
TRAVIS: Okay. With advantage.

3905
03:25:09,830 --> 03:25:15,018
MATT: With advantage. At disadvantage because of
your skill check, so just regular attack.

3906
03:25:15,018 --> 03:25:16,098
LAURA: No.

3907
03:25:16,098 --> 03:25:17,091
MATT: What'd you roll?

3908
03:25:17,091 --> 03:25:19,514
TRAVIS: A one.

3909
03:25:19,514 --> 03:25:23,154
TALIESIN: Watch out for that tree.

3910
03:25:23,154 --> 03:25:26,565
MATT: Getting your momentum, you pull back and
your feet catch the edge, and you push off,

3911
03:25:26,565 --> 03:25:29,745
and you swing out, and as you reach for the next
vine (snapping sound).

3912
03:25:29,745 --> 03:25:31,726
MARISHA: Oh my god.

3913
03:25:31,726 --> 03:25:33,842
LAURA: Ohh. Boo.

3914
03:25:33,842 --> 03:25:40,647
MATT: You plummet to the ground. That puts you,
you take

3915
03:25:40,647 --> 03:25:44,960
eight points of bludgeoning damage and fall prone.

3916
03:25:44,960 --> 03:25:49,196
TRAVIS: Okay. And prone. That's probably more
insulting.

3917
03:25:49,196 --> 03:25:51,405
LIAM: Are you halfway done yet, Groggy?

3918
03:25:51,405 --> 03:25:56,323
TRAVIS: Because it fails, does that still take up
all my action? All my whole thing?

3919
03:25:56,323 --> 03:25:58,917
MATT: I mean, you still have your bonus action.

3920
03:25:58,917 --> 03:26:00,466
TRAVIS: To get up?

3921
03:26:00,466 --> 03:26:03,953
MATT: No, half your movement, but yeah, you won't
be able to this turn, so.

3922
03:26:03,953 --> 03:26:05,899
TRAVIS: I'll cry a little.

3923
03:26:05,899 --> 03:26:08,724
LAURA: Do you have any other bonus, anything you
can do for a bonus action?

3924
03:26:08,724 --> 03:26:11,096
TRAVIS: Do I keep my rage, because I fell and took
damage?

3925
03:26:11,096 --> 03:26:16,796
MATT: Uh. Let me double-check the specifics for
the rage here, if it's, just to make sure.

3926
03:26:16,796 --> 03:26:18,736
TRAVIS: I think it has to be an attack.

3927
03:26:18,736 --> 03:26:20,372
MARISHA: I mean, he's gotta be pretty angry.

3928
03:26:20,372 --> 03:26:21,588
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'd be angry.

3929
03:26:21,588 --> 03:26:22,490
MARISHA: I'd be angry.

3930
03:26:22,490 --> 03:26:24,169
LAURA: Yeah, I'd think that would piss him the
fuck off.

3931
03:26:24,169 --> 03:26:25,380
MATT: No, you took damage, so it maintains.

3932
03:26:25,380 --> 03:26:26,410
(All cheer.)

3933
03:26:26,410 --> 03:26:28,128
MATT: You're really angry now, you're like "Fuck
this!"

3934
03:26:28,128 --> 03:26:29,457
TRAVIS: I'm good.

3935
03:26:29,457 --> 03:26:33,975
MATT: All right. So. That ends Grog's turn.
It is now Sondur's turn. Sondur, who is looking

3936
03:26:33,975 --> 03:26:42,683
at this sudden large werewolf entity that shows up
out of nowhere knows he has to get away from this,

3937
03:26:42,683 --> 03:26:49,943
and is gonna go ahead and attempt to begin by
vine-walking into the, well he heals a little bit

3938
03:26:49,943 --> 03:26:55,914
first, sorry. And then he's gonna go ahead and
vine-walk into the wall. Ukurat does get an attack

3939
03:26:55,914 --> 03:27:07,005
of opportunity on him. That does hit, a 27.
So he takes 15 points of slashing damage.

3940
03:27:07,005 --> 03:27:15,194
And vanishes back into the wall and emerges on
this side here.

3941
03:27:15,194 --> 03:27:17,628
MARISHA: Exactly where Grog was? That's cool.

3942
03:27:17,628 --> 03:27:18,757
MATT: Over here.

3943
03:27:18,757 --> 03:27:22,504
LAURA: So close to where Grog was. Damn it.

3944
03:27:22,504 --> 03:27:26,204
MATT: From there, he's gonna go ahead and make
three attacks with Fenthras.

3945
03:27:26,204 --> 03:27:29,607
First one's gonna be at you, Vex.

3946
03:27:29,607 --> 03:27:31,555
SAM: My God, better miss.

3947
03:27:31,555 --> 03:27:33,689
MATT: That is a 20.

3948
03:27:33,689 --> 03:27:35,495
LAURA: 20 is my armor class.

3949
03:27:35,495 --> 03:27:41,917
MATT: Aw. You suffer 15 points of piercing damage
and

3950
03:27:41,917 --> 03:27:44,656
four points of thunder damage, or, uh, 
lightning damage.

3951
03:27:44,656 --> 03:27:45,890
LAURA: 19?

3952
03:27:45,890 --> 03:27:47,268
MATT: 19.

3953
03:27:47,268 --> 03:27:49,876
LAURA: Cool.

3954
03:27:49,876 --> 03:27:51,125
SAM: You're still alive!

3955
03:27:51,125 --> 03:27:52,290
LAURA: I'm still alive.

3956
03:27:52,290 --> 03:27:54,162
SAM: Wow. That's impressive.

3957
03:27:54,162 --> 03:27:56,780
MATT: Shhnk. The first arrow hits you and you take
the damage and lean against the tree, and you're

3958
03:27:56,780 --> 03:28:00,553
still standing. He goes, (angry roar), pulls back
and takes another shot.

3959
03:28:00,553 --> 03:28:01,728
TALIESIN: God damn it.

3960
03:28:01,728 --> 03:28:07,704
LAURA: Can I shout out, "I was wrong! Uh...
you're so dreamy!"

3961
03:28:07,704 --> 03:28:11,199
MATT: Same exact roll, 20, hits you again.

3962
03:28:11,199 --> 03:28:12,395
SAM: Damn it.

3963
03:28:12,395 --> 03:28:23,655
MATT: Natural nine on that one. This one is going
to be... that is eight plus three, eight points of

3964
03:28:23,655 --> 03:28:25,624
piercing damage plus three points of lightning,
so.

3965
03:28:25,624 --> 03:28:28,256
MARISHA: She's down.

3966
03:28:28,256 --> 03:28:34,772
MATT: With that, Vex falls unconscious onto the
ground. With his third and final shot of the

3967
03:28:34,772 --> 03:28:43,759
round, he's gonna look down at, I'm gonna say at
Percy, who's right below. Take a shot at Percy.

3968
03:28:43,759 --> 03:28:45,056
Natural 20.

3969
03:28:45,056 --> 03:28:46,670
MARISHA: What? What?

3970
03:28:46,670 --> 03:28:47,868
TRAVIS: Wow.

3971
03:28:47,868 --> 03:28:49,646
MATT: It works against you, sometimes.

3972
03:28:49,646 --> 03:28:50,588
TALIESIN: Bastard.

3973
03:28:50,588 --> 03:28:56,073
MARISHA: Fucker's having a good round.

3974
03:28:56,073 --> 03:28:58,178
MATT: 23 points of piercing damage and four points
of lightning.

3975
03:28:58,178 --> 03:29:00,067
TALIESIN: I'm gonna do a missile snare.

3976
03:29:00,067 --> 03:29:00,768
MATT: Okay.

3977
03:29:00,768 --> 03:29:01,908
LAURA: Yes!

3978
03:29:01,908 --> 03:29:03,377
TALIESIN: 23 points of piercing damage?

3979
03:29:03,377 --> 03:29:04,304
MATT: Correct.

3980
03:29:04,304 --> 03:29:10,534
TALIESIN: That's gonna be 13 points of piercing
damage.

3981
03:29:10,534 --> 03:29:12,781
MATT: Okay, plus four lightning, so 17.

3982
03:29:12,781 --> 03:29:18,538
TALIESIN: And can I use that four, I'm gonna take
that four lightning, can that hit the glove?

3983
03:29:18,538 --> 03:29:20,908
MATT: We can say you bring up the glove and it
does--

3984
03:29:20,908 --> 03:29:22,584
TALIESIN: I mean, like, hitting, so--

3985
03:29:22,584 --> 03:29:26,450
MATT: Yeah, it takes the damage, but you kind of
bring it up instinctually and it does seem to rev

3986
03:29:26,450 --> 03:29:27,721
some charge to it.

3987
03:29:27,721 --> 03:29:29,640
TALIESIN: All right, so that's rolling now,
that's in play.

3988
03:29:29,640 --> 03:29:30,377
MATT: There you go.

3989
03:29:30,377 --> 03:29:31,381
TALIESIN: Thank you.

3990
03:29:31,381 --> 03:29:38,043
MATT: All right. That ends his turn. The treants
are gone. Let's see. That's gonna bring us to

3991
03:29:38,043 --> 03:29:40,383
Scanlan and Keyleth.

3992
03:29:40,383 --> 03:29:42,998
SAM: You wanna do--

3993
03:29:42,998 --> 03:29:47,255
MARISHA: I don't know if I can be grappled.

3994
03:29:47,255 --> 03:29:49,395
We can Dimension Door, though, I can try and take
you--

3995
03:29:49,395 --> 03:29:53,467
SAM: Nah, I can't do that to you.

3996
03:29:53,467 --> 03:29:56,843
MARISHA: I can try coming to get you undone.

3997
03:29:56,843 --> 03:29:59,541
SAM: I can't Dimension Door you.

3998
03:29:59,541 --> 03:30:01,916
MARISHA: No, I mean, I mean burn you from the
vines.

3999
03:30:01,916 --> 03:30:02,917
SAM: Oh.

4000
03:30:02,917 --> 03:30:06,732
MARISHA: Like get you ungrappled. I don't know if,
so, question.

4001
03:30:06,732 --> 03:30:12,502
Could Bigby's Hand toss a fire
elemental's ass?

4002
03:30:12,502 --> 03:30:16,209
MATT: Yeah, I mean, you have some sort of
physicality to you,

4003
03:30:16,209 --> 03:30:19,384
it's just somewhat fluid in
its structure.

4004
03:30:19,384 --> 03:30:23,536
MARISHA: So it's like a magical hand meets magical
fire elemental could kinda work?

4005
03:30:23,536 --> 03:30:24,877
MATT: Yeah.

4006
03:30:24,877 --> 03:30:26,110
TRAVIS: Like a Molotov cocktail.

4007
03:30:26,110 --> 03:30:29,525
MARISHA: All right. Here's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna go over to Scanlan and I'm gonna burn

4008
03:30:29,525 --> 03:30:31,833
the vines around him that are holding him in.

4009
03:30:31,833 --> 03:30:32,822
MATT: Okay.

4010
03:30:32,822 --> 03:30:34,100
SAM: Is that your action, though?

4011
03:30:34,100 --> 03:30:35,432
MATT: That would be your action, yeah.

4012
03:30:35,432 --> 03:30:36,479
MARISHA: That's my action?

4013
03:30:36,479 --> 03:30:39,019
SAM: Don't do that, then. You need to, no,
you need to attack--

4014
03:30:39,019 --> 03:30:40,825
LAURA: Yeah, don't use your action to--

4015
03:30:40,825 --> 03:30:42,676
SAM: Fuck that. I'm fine.

4016
03:30:42,676 --> 03:30:45,489
MATT: So as you run up to Scanlan, he's telling
you this. What are you doing?

4017
03:30:45,489 --> 03:30:48,097
SAM: Leave me, I'm fine, this is cozy.

4018
03:30:48,097 --> 03:30:54,964
MARISHA: I go, "Okay." And I hold my action until
I wait for Scanlan. I wait for Scanlan.

4019
03:30:54,964 --> 03:30:57,795
MATT: Okay, so you move over there and you hold
your action waiting for Scanlan to...

4020
03:30:57,795 --> 03:30:59,842
MARISHA: To--

4021
03:30:59,842 --> 03:31:01,136
SAM: To throw you.

4022
03:31:01,136 --> 03:31:02,143
MARISHA: To throw me.

4023
03:31:02,143 --> 03:31:04,079
MATT: Okay. All right. Scanlan.

4024
03:31:04,079 --> 03:31:11,797
SAM: I will heal Vex with my bonus action first,
right, she's still within range, yes?

4025
03:31:11,797 --> 03:31:12,570
MATT: Yeah.

4026
03:31:12,570 --> 03:31:16,300
SAM: (singing) I'm... I don't know.

4027
03:31:16,300 --> 03:31:23,198
I'm giving you everything, 
all that health will bring, this is true.

4028
03:31:23,198 --> 03:31:24,996
TRAVIS: Fucking Spice Girls.

4029
03:31:24,996 --> 03:31:26,522
LAURA: Is that Spice Girls?

4030
03:31:26,522 --> 03:31:32,793
SAM: (singing) And all I want from you is a
promise you will kiss me forever.

4031
03:31:32,793 --> 03:31:34,429
MARISHA: It was girl power that healed you.

4032
03:31:34,429 --> 03:31:35,670
LAURA: Girl power healed me. I feel it.

4033
03:31:35,670 --> 03:31:37,829
MARISHA: I'm feeling it, yeah. Spice magic.

4034
03:31:37,829 --> 03:31:40,267
SAM: (singing) I'm - I'm! - giving you
everything, all that health I bring, yeah--

4035
03:31:40,267 --> 03:31:44,987
All right, so that's at level one.

4036
03:31:44,987 --> 03:31:48,959
MATT: So 1d4 plus six.

4037
03:31:48,959 --> 03:31:50,132
SAM: Eight.

4038
03:31:50,132 --> 03:31:51,034
LAURA: Awesome.

4039
03:31:51,034 --> 03:31:53,652
MATT: So you heal eight. You come to consciousness
again on the ground, face-down, you can see the

4040
03:31:53,652 --> 03:31:55,764
sludge sort of filling in your nostrils--

4041
03:31:55,764 --> 03:31:57,586
LAURA: (gasps) Spice Girls?

4042
03:31:57,586 --> 03:31:59,383
MARISHA: This is my jam.

4043
03:31:59,383 --> 03:32:04,047
SAM: And then I will cast Bigby's Hand.

4044
03:32:04,047 --> 03:32:06,900
MATT: All righty. Next to Keyleth.

4045
03:32:06,900 --> 03:32:10,087
SAM: Next to Keyleth, and cup her gently.

4046
03:32:10,087 --> 03:32:12,310
MARISHA: I turn into a fireball myself.

4047
03:32:12,310 --> 03:32:14,166
MATT: Okay.

4048
03:32:14,166 --> 03:32:18,606
SAM: And just sort of cup and fling.

4049
03:32:18,606 --> 03:32:20,208
TRAVIS: Cup that ball.

4050
03:32:20,208 --> 03:32:21,340
MARISHA: Very gently.

4051
03:32:21,340 --> 03:32:22,985
TALIESIN: As you've cupped so many before.

4052
03:32:22,985 --> 03:32:23,996
SAM: Yes.

4053
03:32:23,996 --> 03:32:26,043
MATT: Okay. Roll a d20 plus eight.

4054
03:32:26,043 --> 03:32:27,786
SAM: What is that for?

4055
03:32:27,786 --> 03:32:31,695
MATT: That is the strength of Bigby's Hand
throwing the elemental.

4056
03:32:31,695 --> 03:32:33,646
TALIESIN: (singing) I believe in you, you can do
the thing.

4057
03:32:33,646 --> 03:32:34,639
SAM: 24.

4058
03:32:34,639 --> 03:32:44,205
MATT: 24. You lob the elemental in a wide arc.
It makes it most of the way, and then falls past

4059
03:32:44,205 --> 03:32:50,744
and lands on the ground there. You are by him.
Not quite a hit on that one, unfortunately.

4060
03:32:50,744 --> 03:32:52,838
MARISHA: God damn it!

4061
03:32:52,838 --> 03:32:56,446
MATT: But you do take five points of bludgeoning
damage from the fall.

4062
03:32:56,446 --> 03:32:58,519
LAURA: Ooh, nice.

4063
03:32:58,519 --> 03:33:03,919
MATT: A 25 or higher would have got to him.
He's a long ways away!

4064
03:33:03,919 --> 03:33:07,259
MARISHA: Five points halved, or was that--

4065
03:33:07,259 --> 03:33:08,417
MATT: That's halved.

4066
03:33:08,417 --> 03:33:10,634
SAM: Hey, you've still got your attack.

4067
03:33:10,634 --> 03:33:11,634
MARISHA: Did I?

4068
03:33:11,634 --> 03:33:12,807
TRAVIS: Yeah, you've been thrown.

4069
03:33:12,807 --> 03:33:17,342
MATT: You held your action, so you can still use
your action to do something if you can.

4070
03:33:17,342 --> 03:33:19,837
TRAVIS: Can you?

4071
03:33:19,837 --> 03:33:20,912
MARISHA: Can I--

4072
03:33:20,912 --> 03:33:22,418
SAM: Just throw a fireball?

4073
03:33:22,418 --> 03:33:23,629
MARISHA: I can't do that.

4074
03:33:23,629 --> 03:33:24,957
SAM: Aren't you Johnny Storm?

4075
03:33:24,957 --> 03:33:26,553
MARISHA: I gotta be there.

4076
03:33:26,553 --> 03:33:28,262
MATT: Yeah, it's a melee thing.

4077
03:33:28,262 --> 03:33:31,157
MARISHA: Do I still have any movement?

4078
03:33:31,157 --> 03:33:35,315
MATT: No, just your action. To get through,
I'd say... what's your speed as an elemental?

4079
03:33:35,315 --> 03:33:36,375
MARISHA: 50.

4080
03:33:36,375 --> 03:33:39,558
MATT: 50? It took you 25 to get there, you still
have 25 feet, I would say.

4081
03:33:39,558 --> 03:33:46,481
MARISHA: Can I start climbing 25 feet up the
wall?

4082
03:33:46,481 --> 03:33:49,222
MATT: Make an athletics check.

4083
03:33:49,222 --> 03:33:50,406
MARISHA: Okay.

4084
03:33:50,406 --> 03:33:54,276
MATT: Using the strength of the fire elemental.
Add your strength modifier.

4085
03:33:54,276 --> 03:33:56,113
MARISHA: Not good.

4086
03:33:56,113 --> 03:33:56,959
MATT: What'd you roll?

4087
03:33:56,959 --> 03:33:57,896
MARISHA: Five.

4088
03:33:57,896 --> 03:34:01,362
MATT: Five? You start climbing up, you get maybe
five feet up the wall, but already the impact of

4089
03:34:01,362 --> 03:34:05,175
the fall and most of your round exhausted you for
this one pass.

4090
03:34:05,175 --> 03:34:09,751
MARISHA: Okay, well then I'm gonna take the rest
of my action, I'm just going to angrily slam into

4091
03:34:09,751 --> 03:34:13,602
the tree, and see if I can catch the tree up under
him on fire.

4092
03:34:13,602 --> 03:34:17,540
MATT: Okay, cool. Ending your turn, Keyleth.
Vex, you're up.

4093
03:34:17,540 --> 03:34:18,725
LAURA: I'm up?

4094
03:34:18,725 --> 03:34:20,717
MATT: Yeah, you're conscious, you're on the
ground.

4095
03:34:20,717 --> 03:34:22,977
SAM: Run away.

4096
03:34:22,977 --> 03:34:31,390
LAURA: Uh, oh right, you're on the ground.
Can I, ah, fuck. Okay.

4097
03:34:31,390 --> 03:34:35,247
MATT: Actually, hold on. Sorry, I'm gonna be a
dick here.

4098
03:34:35,247 --> 03:34:36,282
TALIESIN: Really?

4099
03:34:36,282 --> 03:34:39,250
MATT: He's getting his legendary actions back at
the end of Keyleth's turn, watching Scanlan heal

4100
03:34:39,250 --> 03:34:42,422
you, he's gonna use another one of his legendary
actions to take an attack on you as you come to

4101
03:34:42,422 --> 03:34:43,746
consciousness on the ground.

4102
03:34:43,746 --> 03:34:45,263
LAURA: You're an asshole, Sondur.

4103
03:34:45,263 --> 03:34:51,557
MATT: He does attack at disadvantage, though,
because you are prone. That puts him at a 16.

4104
03:34:51,557 --> 03:34:52,433
LAURA: Yay!

4105
03:34:52,433 --> 03:34:54,369
(Loud computer noise in the background.)

4106
03:34:54,369 --> 03:34:58,511
MATT: He fires an arrow, but it hits the ground
inches from your face. You see the spike impact

4107
03:34:58,511 --> 03:34:59,767
and then turn to dust.

4108
03:34:59,767 --> 03:35:01,327
LAURA: Youuu.

4109
03:35:01,327 --> 03:35:02,839
MATT: All right, so take your turn.

4110
03:35:02,839 --> 03:35:06,948
LAURA: Fuck. I'm gonna... it's useless, I can't do
anything.

4111
03:35:06,948 --> 03:35:09,028
SAM: Heal yourself.

4112
03:35:09,028 --> 03:35:13,214
LAURA: I know, but my heal is an action,
and then I can't attack.

4113
03:35:13,214 --> 03:35:15,107
SAM: Do you have any more potions?

4114
03:35:15,107 --> 03:35:19,713
LAURA: Um. I've got, oh, I've got a superior
healing potion,

4115
03:35:19,713 --> 03:35:21,815
that's better than a greater, right?

4116
03:35:21,815 --> 03:35:22,699
MATT: Yeah.

4117
03:35:22,699 --> 03:35:24,212
LAURA: Okay. I'll use that.

4118
03:35:24,212 --> 03:35:26,567
SAM: Is that like a venti?

4119
03:35:26,567 --> 03:35:28,452
MATT: Yeah, that is 8d4 plus eight.

4120
03:35:28,452 --> 03:35:29,497
SAM: Whoa!

4121
03:35:29,497 --> 03:35:30,584
LAURA: Okay.

4122
03:35:30,584 --> 03:35:32,206
MATT: That is one of the pricy healing potions.

4123
03:35:32,206 --> 03:35:33,499
LAURA: Oh, well, okay.

4124
03:35:33,499 --> 03:35:35,378
TALIESIN: Burn it!

4125
03:35:35,378 --> 03:35:44,971
LAURA: Ten...

4126
03:35:44,971 --> 03:35:47,085
MARISHA: That would've been so cool had it
worked.

4127
03:35:47,085 --> 03:35:48,729
TALIESIN: I know. Had it worked.

4128
03:35:48,729 --> 03:35:50,229
LAURA: 20 plus eight... 28.

4129
03:35:50,229 --> 03:35:52,373
MATT: 28 you heal, yeah.

4130
03:35:52,373 --> 03:35:54,520
SAM: That's the last time I listen to you.

4131
03:35:54,520 --> 03:35:56,273
TALIESIN: It was a good plan.

4132
03:35:56,273 --> 03:36:05,208
LAURA: Okay, so I'm back at 36. Okay. I'm gonna
run and duck behind Grog.

4133
03:36:05,208 --> 03:36:09,097
MATT: Well, you get up, which is half your
movement, so you have five, 15 more feet,

4134
03:36:09,097 --> 03:36:10,165
so you can move three squares.

4135
03:36:10,165 --> 03:36:11,421
LAURA: Can I get to Grog?

4136
03:36:11,421 --> 03:36:13,920
MATT: No. You can get there, is the closest you
can get.

4137
03:36:13,920 --> 03:36:19,733
LAURA: All right, I'll go to there and then I
will, I'm gonna Hail of Thorns him again.

4138
03:36:19,733 --> 03:36:21,625
MATT: Okay.

4139
03:36:21,625 --> 03:36:22,630
LAURA: Oh wait, is that--

4140
03:36:22,630 --> 03:36:24,967
MATT: No, your Hail of Thorns is a bonus action,
and you already used your heal spell, so no.

4141
03:36:24,967 --> 03:36:29,009
LAURA: A bonus action, okay. Then I'm gonna,
so I've got two attacks on him.

4142
03:36:29,009 --> 03:36:30,562
MATT: Yeah, you do.

4143
03:36:30,562 --> 03:36:33,817
LAURA: I'm gonna hit him with two attacks.

4144
03:36:33,817 --> 03:36:35,449
MATT: Go for it, roll for the attacks.

4145
03:36:35,449 --> 03:36:38,009
LAURA: I get another flaming bowstring, I've got
one more flaming bowstring.

4146
03:36:38,009 --> 03:36:40,415
MATT: Vax, you're up next, by the way. Go for it.

4147
03:36:40,415 --> 03:36:42,115
SAM: Someday Travis will attack again.

4148
03:36:42,115 --> 03:36:43,665
MATT: The first one is the flaming bowstring.

4149
03:36:43,665 --> 03:36:44,854
TRAVIS: Will he?

4150
03:36:44,854 --> 03:36:45,836
SAM: It's been like eight weeks.

4151
03:36:45,836 --> 03:36:47,558
MATT: 17. The flaming shot unfortunately goes
wide,

4152
03:36:47,558 --> 03:36:49,902
slams into the wall next to him and the
flame curls up.

4153
03:36:49,902 --> 03:36:51,807
LAURA: Okay, so 23 on the second hit.

4154
03:36:51,807 --> 03:36:56,620
MATT: Second hit does hit, so roll damage.

4155
03:36:56,620 --> 03:36:57,580
LAURA: 15.

4156
03:36:57,580 --> 03:36:59,523
MATT: 15 points of damage? All righty.

4157
03:36:59,523 --> 03:37:01,731
LAURA: And then I'm gonna duck behind the tree as
much as I can.

4158
03:37:01,731 --> 03:37:03,894
MATT: Well, that was your full movement was to get
there, so.

4159
03:37:03,894 --> 03:37:06,714
LAURA: Can I not use my full movement to get--

4160
03:37:06,714 --> 03:37:12,221
MATT: To get behind the tree? Hmm, you wouldn't
really have much of a shot at him. I guess he--

4161
03:37:12,221 --> 03:37:14,129
LAURA: Could I have shot him before I moved?

4162
03:37:14,129 --> 03:37:18,562
MATT: You would've been there, suuuure. I normally
don't let that retroactively happen.

4163
03:37:18,562 --> 03:37:19,977
LAURA: Okay okay okay.

4164
03:37:19,977 --> 03:37:23,067
MATT: I'm gonna say you're halfway through.
You're sort of there.

4165
03:37:23,067 --> 03:37:24,254
LAURA: Okay.

4166
03:37:24,254 --> 03:37:28,492
MATT: All right. So. That brings us to Vax.
You're up.

4167
03:37:28,492 --> 03:37:30,064
LIAM: Vex just healed herself, right?

4168
03:37:30,064 --> 03:37:31,128
MATT: She did, yes.

4169
03:37:31,128 --> 03:37:33,594
LIAM: All right. All right. And is he within 60
feet of me?

4170
03:37:33,594 --> 03:37:38,020
MATT: Actually, uh, he is, but at the end of Vex's
turn he's going to take a second shot.

4171
03:37:38,020 --> 03:37:39,904
LAURA: What? What? Why?

4172
03:37:39,904 --> 03:37:42,961
MATT: No, he's gonna use his other two legendary
actions to cast another spell.

4173
03:37:42,961 --> 03:37:44,203
LAURA: He just has so much.

4174
03:37:44,282 --> 03:37:46,375
TALIESIN: Asshole!

4175
03:37:46,612 --> 03:37:48,345
MATT: Angry that she gets up and runs off to the
side, he says,

4176
03:37:48,345 --> 03:37:51,281
"You stay DOWN."

4177
03:37:51,281 --> 03:37:53,300
I need you to make another constitution saving throw.

4178
03:37:53,300 --> 03:38:00,591
LAURA: Jeez Louise, come on, man! Saving throw?

4179
03:38:00,591 --> 03:38:01,411
MATT: Yes.

4180
03:38:01,411 --> 03:38:02,650
LAURA: 19.

4181
03:38:02,650 --> 03:38:04,755
MATT: 19? What's your constitution modifier?

4182
03:38:04,755 --> 03:38:08,189
LAURA: Zero, but I have a +2 on all saving throws
with my ring.

4183
03:38:08,189 --> 03:38:14,581
MATT: That's true. Nice. All righty. That is...

4184
03:38:14,581 --> 03:38:17,642
TALIESIN: God damn it.

4185
03:38:17,642 --> 03:38:21,491
TRAVIS: Yeah, when it's like, when he's playing
fucking Applejacks back there.

4186
03:38:21,491 --> 03:38:27,699
MARISHA: I know.

4187
03:38:27,699 --> 03:38:30,587
LAURA: Is this another Blight, did he cast Blight
again? Motherfuck.

4188
03:38:30,587 --> 03:38:34,152
MATT: 41 points of necrotic damage, halved to 20,
you take 20.

4189
03:38:34,152 --> 03:38:35,004
LAURA: Oh, god.

4190
03:38:35,004 --> 03:38:35,829
SAM: You out again?

4191
03:38:35,829 --> 03:38:36,595
MARISHA: You're down again, aren't you?

4192
03:38:36,595 --> 03:38:39,754
LAURA: No, it was halved to 20, so I'm 16.

4193
03:38:39,754 --> 03:38:40,723
SAM: Hey!

4194
03:38:40,723 --> 03:38:42,375
MATT: But a second Blight is used.

4195
03:38:42,375 --> 03:38:43,539
MARISHA: Blight's nasty.

4196
03:38:43,539 --> 03:38:44,773
TALIESIN: Blight's nasty.

4197
03:38:44,773 --> 03:38:46,589
MATT: All right. Vax, now it's your turn.

4198
03:38:46,589 --> 03:38:48,593
LIAM: He's within 60 feet of me?

4199
03:38:48,593 --> 03:38:50,590
MATT: He would be, yes.

4200
03:38:50,590 --> 03:38:56,339
LIAM: All right. And is there anyone around me? I
just can't see too well from here.

4201
03:38:56,339 --> 03:38:58,689
MATT: There's people around you, but there's
nobody next to him.

4202
03:38:58,689 --> 03:39:08,819
LIAM: Next to him, no, I know. Fuck it. I'm gonna
burn a bonus action and shoot out the wings and

4203
03:39:08,819 --> 03:39:11,732
I'm gonna fly into his face and stab into each
side of his neck.

4204
03:39:11,732 --> 03:39:12,817
TALIESIN: Fuck yeah!

4205
03:39:12,817 --> 03:39:18,674
MATT: All righty. All of a sudden, the giant raven
wings streak out from each side of you and the air

4206
03:39:18,674 --> 03:39:22,594
in the entirety of the room begins to swirl around
you, your hair gets tossed, as the giant wings

4207
03:39:22,594 --> 03:39:29,220
begin to push him into the air. The raven-like
dagger-wielding champion of the Raven Queen leaps

4208
03:39:29,220 --> 03:39:33,795
up and finds himself face-to-face with Sondur,
blades out. Go ahead and make your attacks.

4209
03:39:33,795 --> 03:39:39,215
MARISHA: The breeze from his wings kinda stokes my
fire elemental form a little bit

4210
03:39:39,215 --> 03:39:40,479
and I'm kind of into it.

4211
03:39:40,479 --> 03:39:44,445
MATT: There you go. Yeah you are! Vax, go for it.

4212
03:39:44,445 --> 03:39:45,495
LIAM: 28 on the first.

4213
03:39:45,495 --> 03:39:47,046
MATT: Hits.

4214
03:39:47,046 --> 03:39:48,445
LIAM: 29 on the second.

4215
03:39:48,445 --> 03:39:49,428
MATT: Hits.

4216
03:39:49,428 --> 03:39:51,231
LIAM: As I stab into both sides of his neck,
I say,

4217
03:39:51,231 --> 03:39:53,319
If you want to get to my sister you gotta
get through me.

4218
03:39:53,319 --> 03:39:58,009
Stab-stab. First one is ten,
second one is eight.

4219
03:39:58,009 --> 03:40:03,526
MATT: All righty. As you jam both blades into the
side, the flames kind of curling up from the hit

4220
03:40:03,526 --> 03:40:08,719
of one, the poison dagger jammed into the other,
the head descends and the mouth opens and from

4221
03:40:08,719 --> 03:40:13,258
the inside you can see the semblance of the
human-like face you saw before come peek through,

4222
03:40:13,258 --> 03:40:19,148
leaning out, almost like the queen alien's
secondary mouth. It kind of leans into your face,

4223
03:40:19,148 --> 03:40:22,768
and the grin curls up in this evil smile.

4224
03:40:22,768 --> 03:40:30,226
"I'll take both of you at this rate. There's only
so many betrayals one can survive."

4225
03:40:30,226 --> 03:40:34,599
It clinks back into the head, the jaw closes. 
That finishes your turn, Vax.

4226
03:40:34,599 --> 03:40:35,712
LIAM: Yep.

4227
03:40:35,712 --> 03:40:37,585
MATT: Percy, you're up. At the end of Vax's
turn...

4228
03:40:37,585 --> 03:40:39,417
no, he can't, he already used his spell,
you're right.

4229
03:40:39,417 --> 03:40:42,758
TALIESIN: All right. Okay.

4230
03:40:42,758 --> 03:40:45,259
MARISHA: This guy had a rough breakup or
something, man.

4231
03:40:45,259 --> 03:40:53,381
TALIESIN: No breakup is that rough. I'm going to,
I'm switching back to Bad News, and I'm going to

4232
03:40:53,381 --> 03:40:57,345
reload and I'm going to try and, got that last
grit,

4233
03:40:57,345 --> 03:40:59,766
I'm gonna just try and get him to drop the bow.

4234
03:40:59,766 --> 03:41:01,469
MATT: Okay.

4235
03:41:01,469 --> 03:41:02,862
MARISHA: Come on, Percy.

4236
03:41:02,862 --> 03:41:04,909
TALIESIN: Part one. That'll do. 24.

4237
03:41:04,909 --> 03:41:06,549
MATT: 24 hits.

4238
03:41:06,549 --> 03:41:09,145
TALIESIN: He has to make a strength saving throw.

4239
03:41:09,145 --> 03:41:12,037
MATT: Okay, that is a two, he's gonna use a
legendary resistance,

4240
03:41:12,037 --> 03:41:14,368
the second one, to make the save.

4241
03:41:14,368 --> 03:41:16,231
TALIESIN: Made the save using a legendary
resistance.

4242
03:41:16,231 --> 03:41:17,025
MATT: Yes.

4243
03:41:17,025 --> 03:41:19,089
TALIESIN: Okay, that's fine, don't care.

4244
03:41:19,089 --> 03:41:24,397
MARISHA: (laughing) Don't care.

4245
03:41:24,397 --> 03:41:28,744
TALIESIN: That'll do. That's 20 points of damage.

4246
03:41:28,744 --> 03:41:32,153
MATT: All right.

4247
03:41:32,153 --> 03:41:34,268
SAM: He has to make a strength check?

4248
03:41:34,268 --> 03:41:36,789
TALIESIN: He has to make a, it's strength saving
throw.

4249
03:41:36,789 --> 03:41:37,840
SAM: Saving.

4250
03:41:37,840 --> 03:41:39,888
TALIESIN: Yeah, he makes it.

4251
03:41:39,888 --> 03:41:45,379
SAM: Because I had a Cutting Words a while back.

4252
03:41:45,379 --> 03:41:49,451
MATT: Right, but it means he has disadvantage,
but even if he fails, which he would've in that

4253
03:41:49,451 --> 03:41:53,035
case, he still gets to make it automatically as
part of the legendary resistance.

4254
03:41:53,035 --> 03:41:55,932
SAM: So that's negated my Cutting Words as well.

4255
03:41:55,932 --> 03:41:59,143
MATT: For a legendary resistance, it does.
Which is why if you can burn through those early,

4256
03:41:59,143 --> 03:42:02,198
then they're a little more vulnerable.

4257
03:42:02,198 --> 03:42:06,768
TALIESIN: And just because nothing else seems to
be happening, I'm just gonna burn my Action Surge

4258
03:42:06,768 --> 03:42:09,930
and just keep plowing into him for two more
shots.

4259
03:42:09,930 --> 03:42:11,462
MATT: All right. How much damage did the first one
do?

4260
03:42:11,462 --> 03:42:16,838
TALIESIN: That did 20 points of damage.

4261
03:42:16,838 --> 03:42:20,571
MATT: Nice! (gunshot sound)

4262
03:42:20,571 --> 03:42:25,684
TALIESIN: Taking another shot, that's 29.

4263
03:42:25,684 --> 03:42:27,047
MATT: Hits.

4264
03:42:27,047 --> 03:42:32,856
TALIESIN: That's 28 points of damage.

4265
03:42:32,856 --> 03:42:34,792
MATT: Three hits. Go ahead and roll the other two
damage, now.

4266
03:42:34,792 --> 03:42:35,615
TALIESIN: Hm?

4267
03:42:35,615 --> 03:42:37,087
MATT: So you hit with all three, so.

4268
03:42:37,087 --> 03:42:38,477
TALIESIN: No, I've been doing damage.

4269
03:42:38,477 --> 03:42:39,819
MATT: Oh, those were the damage.

4270
03:42:39,819 --> 03:42:40,688
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4271
03:42:40,688 --> 03:42:41,724
MATT: Oh, I'm sorry.

4272
03:42:41,724 --> 03:42:44,667
TALIESIN: Sorry. That's 20 points of damage and 28
points of damage. 22... wait.

4273
03:42:44,667 --> 03:42:46,520
20 points of damage on the first attack.

4274
03:42:46,520 --> 03:42:47,375
MATT: Yeah.

4275
03:42:47,375 --> 03:42:53,534
TALIESIN: Attack I just did was 28 points of
damage.

4276
03:42:53,534 --> 03:42:55,243
MATT: 28, sorry, all right, and then the third
one.

4277
03:42:55,243 --> 03:42:56,670
TALIESIN: And then the third one.

4278
03:42:56,670 --> 03:42:59,599
MATT: Roll to hit.

4279
03:42:59,599 --> 03:43:03,291
TALIESIN: That hits, that's a 31.

4280
03:43:03,291 --> 03:43:04,226
MATT: All righty.

4281
03:43:04,226 --> 03:43:05,605
MARISHA: Do you crit on a 19?

4282
03:43:05,605 --> 03:43:06,997
TALIESIN: I do not crit on a 19.

4283
03:43:06,997 --> 03:43:09,050
MARISHA: Fuck. That's a good roll, though,
that's a good roll.

4284
03:43:09,050 --> 03:43:10,782
TALIESIN: 18 points of damage.

4285
03:43:10,782 --> 03:43:17,546
MATT: Nice. So (three gunshots) you can see now
he's starting to sag as he hangs outside of the

4286
03:43:17,546 --> 03:43:23,451
wall with the daggers still held in him by Vax,
both impacts, each blast hitting the side of his

4287
03:43:23,451 --> 03:43:29,246
torso, you can see now the wooden-armored exterior
is shattered and there's just this writhing mass

4288
03:43:29,246 --> 03:43:33,766
of dark veiny vines holding his torso together.
He's looking pretty rough.

4289
03:43:33,766 --> 03:43:38,183
TALIESIN: Lay into him! And I'm gonna run and
try and get some cover on the ent.

4290
03:43:38,183 --> 03:43:41,665
In the dead-ent. Dead-ent dead-ent.

4291
03:43:41,665 --> 03:43:43,010
SAM: (to the tune of the Pink Panther theme)
Dead-ent dead-ent--

4292
03:43:43,010 --> 03:43:44,651
SAM, TALIESIN, and MARISHA: Dead-ent dead-ent
dead-ent dead-ent--

4293
03:43:44,651 --> 03:43:45,910
MATT: Grog, you're up.

4294
03:43:45,910 --> 03:43:47,299
LIAM: (slightly delayed) Dead-ent.

4295
03:43:47,299 --> 03:43:49,094
TRAVIS: All right, can I stand up?

4296
03:43:49,094 --> 03:43:50,000
MATT: Yes.

4297
03:43:50,000 --> 03:43:55,996
TRAVIS: And I casually walk over so that I'm
standing between Vex and Sondur, right in front of

4298
03:43:55,996 --> 03:43:58,018
Vex, like a human shield.

4299
03:43:58,018 --> 03:43:59,144
MATT: Right there? Yes.

4300
03:43:59,144 --> 03:44:05,173
TRAVIS: And I look up and I'm like, "Jesus,
this is fucking stupid. I've broken some hearts

4301
03:44:05,173 --> 03:44:12,713
in my time, but you, stupid Romeo, are taking it
way too far. Guess what? NOBODY CARES." And I take

4302
03:44:12,713 --> 03:44:15,099
the javelin of lightning and I throw it at him.

4303
03:44:15,099 --> 03:44:17,377
(All cheer.)

4304
03:44:17,377 --> 03:44:21,069
MATT: Slick. So let's go ahead and roll for that.

4305
03:44:21,069 --> 03:44:23,119
SAM: Javelin of lightning.

4306
03:44:23,119 --> 03:44:24,318
TALIESIN: Very very fair.

4307
03:44:24,318 --> 03:44:26,855
MATT: Let me see what you have to do for that.
Do you have the item rules there?

4308
03:44:26,855 --> 03:44:27,969
TRAVIS: I do have it here.

4309
03:44:27,969 --> 03:44:29,107
MATT: What does it say?

4310
03:44:29,107 --> 03:44:35,152
TRAVIS: If it hits, they have to make a DC 17
dexterity saving throw. If it hits, it's a 4d6

4311
03:44:35,152 --> 03:44:37,546
lightning. Half if they make it.

4312
03:44:37,546 --> 03:44:39,596
MATT: Right. So go ahead and roll to hit,
what was the hit?

4313
03:44:39,596 --> 03:44:41,233
TALIESIN: And he burned a legendary save.

4314
03:44:41,311 --> 03:44:43,802
TRAVIS: It was 24.

4315
03:44:43,802 --> 03:44:45,474
SAM: He burned two of them.

4316
03:44:45,474 --> 03:44:46,251
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4317
03:44:46,251 --> 03:44:49,744
MATT: It hits, go ahead and roll damage.

4318
03:44:49,744 --> 03:44:50,807
TRAVIS: 4d6.

4319
03:44:50,807 --> 03:44:53,762
SAM: He didn't use any sort of legendary thing,
Matt?

4320
03:44:53,762 --> 03:44:57,878
MATT: Well, when you hurl it, you don't roll to
hit with it. Five feet wide, it extends out from

4321
03:44:57,878 --> 03:44:59,978
you to the target within 120 feet.

4322
03:44:59,978 --> 03:45:06,735
Each creature in the line, excluding you and
the target, must make a DC... no, you're right,

4323
03:45:06,735 --> 03:45:11,548
I read too far ahead. Yeah, you're good,
so 4d6 lightning damage.

4324
03:45:11,548 --> 03:45:15,826
TRAVIS: Nice. Six, eight, seven... 12.

4325
03:45:15,826 --> 03:45:17,650
MATT: 12 points of lightning damage?

4326
03:45:17,650 --> 03:45:19,611
TRAVIS: 12 points of lightning damage.

4327
03:45:19,611 --> 03:45:20,616
MATT: How do you want to do this?

4328
03:45:20,616 --> 03:45:22,370
(All scream and cheer.)

4329
03:45:22,370 --> 03:45:23,364
LAURA: Fuck, yeah!

4330
03:45:23,364 --> 03:45:24,487
MARISHA: Yeah, Grog!

4331
03:45:24,487 --> 03:45:25,650
SAM: You got the kill?

4332
03:45:25,650 --> 03:45:26,356
MARISHA: Yes!

4333
03:45:26,356 --> 03:45:27,945
SAM: You didn't do anything!

4334
03:45:27,945 --> 03:45:30,786
TALIESIN: Walking around like an idiot the entire
game.

4335
03:45:30,786 --> 03:45:33,077
TRAVIS: Chasing him around the room.

4336
03:45:33,077 --> 03:45:35,345
SAM: You fell five times!

4337
03:45:35,345 --> 03:45:37,716
MARISHA: You basically killed him with bro-shame.

4338
03:45:37,716 --> 03:45:39,256
LIAM: And that cheeky line about romance.

4339
03:45:39,256 --> 03:45:47,646
TRAVIS: I know, fuck! I throw it and hopefully get
it to go right in his mouth as he's trying to have

4340
03:45:47,646 --> 03:45:53,608
a comeback. And I'll just look bewildered that it
worked.

4341
03:45:53,608 --> 03:45:55,056
MATT: As you just shove it upward--

4342
03:45:55,056 --> 03:45:58,147
LIAM: Can he use his bonus action to just shove
his sunglasses up at the end?

4343
03:45:58,147 --> 03:46:03,211
MATT: As you chuck the javelin, you see it burst
forth with lightning-based propulsion magic.

4344
03:46:03,211 --> 03:46:09,676
It sinks into the center of the jaw, which the
eyes go wide, the jaw hangs open loosely,

4345
03:46:09,676 --> 03:46:16,538
and you can see the secondary face of Sondur
inside, the javelin pierced through his jaw now,

4346
03:46:16,538 --> 03:46:20,963
his eyes wide, and you see the hand reach up to
try and grab the back of the vines. As he does,

4347
03:46:20,963 --> 03:46:30,251
the javelin bursts into a shockwave of electrical
energy, scattering his body into a hundred pieces

4348
03:46:30,251 --> 03:46:37,787
across the wall, falling off. Vax, you are pushed
back from the force of it, tumbling, manage to

4349
03:46:37,787 --> 03:46:42,382
catch yourself in the air with your wings,
still flying, as the rest of Sondur's body just

4350
03:46:42,382 --> 03:46:48,477
comes clattering to the ground in chunks.

4351
03:46:48,477 --> 03:46:52,143
LAURA: I jump up on Grog's back. What the fuck!

4352
03:46:52,143 --> 03:46:53,929
TRAVIS: I honestly did not expect that to happen.

4353
03:46:53,929 --> 03:46:55,598
TALIESIN: I'm gonna walk up and grab--

4354
03:46:55,598 --> 03:46:56,787
LAURA: Oh my god.

4355
03:46:56,787 --> 03:46:57,878
MATT: The javelin clatters to the ground.

4356
03:46:57,878 --> 03:46:59,582
TALIESIN: Grab the bow, real quick.

4357
03:46:59,582 --> 03:47:01,993
TRAVIS: I go get the javelin, because it's
obviously worth keeping.

4358
03:47:02,039 --> 03:47:05,508
SAM: I instinctually throw Keyleth in the air.

4359
03:47:05,508 --> 03:47:07,171
MARISHA: And I go for it, too.

4360
03:47:07,171 --> 03:47:11,421
MATT: You manage to dig yourself out of your vines
and rush up to Keyleth.

4361
03:47:11,421 --> 03:47:12,619
SAM: No, no, with the hand.

4362
03:47:12,619 --> 03:47:15,999
MATT: With the hand, oh yeah. The hand darts over,
grabs the fire elemental, and just kinda

4363
03:47:15,999 --> 03:47:19,579
(sound of throwing and catching).

4364
03:47:19,579 --> 03:47:21,973
MARISHA: Heeheehee.

4365
03:47:21,973 --> 03:47:27,279
TRAVIS: Can I run back to Vex and offer her a
healing potion, unless someone can do better?

4366
03:47:27,279 --> 03:47:30,422
LAURA: Oh, I can cast Cure Wounds on myself.

4367
03:47:30,422 --> 03:47:32,386
TRAVIS: Are you all right?

4368
03:47:32,386 --> 03:47:39,675
LAURA: I'm fine. Thank you. I was really
regretting that, attacking him, I thought maybe I

4369
03:47:39,675 --> 03:47:42,859
should've just said yes and dealt with it.

4370
03:47:42,859 --> 03:47:44,443
TRAVIS: What, become a corpse bride?

4371
03:47:44,443 --> 03:47:45,451
TALIESIN: He was terrible.

4372
03:47:45,451 --> 03:47:46,892
LAURA: I don't know, I just felt terrible.

4373
03:47:46,892 --> 03:47:48,210
TALIESIN: He was terrible.

4374
03:47:48,210 --> 03:47:50,852
MARISHA: I drop my fire elemental form.

4375
03:47:50,852 --> 03:47:52,038
TALIESIN: That was a terrible person.

4376
03:47:52,038 --> 03:47:54,215
TRAVIS: It's all right.

4377
03:47:54,215 --> 03:47:56,033
LAURA: Thanks, Grog.

4378
03:47:56,033 --> 03:47:57,855
TRAVIS: You did... you did good.

4379
03:47:57,855 --> 03:47:59,393
LAURA: Thanks, so did you.

4380
03:47:59,393 --> 03:48:02,794
MATT: A loud impact sounds as Ukurat lands.

4381
03:48:02,794 --> 03:48:04,258
SAM: Oh, thank god.

4382
03:48:04,258 --> 03:48:09,643
LAURA: I'm gonna cast Cure Wounds on myself before
anything else happens. As high of a level as I

4383
03:48:09,643 --> 03:48:10,498
can, which is level three.

4384
03:48:10,498 --> 03:48:11,628
MATT: Go for it.

4385
03:48:11,628 --> 03:48:13,612
SAM: Does my Song of Rest need to be during a
short rest?

4386
03:48:13,612 --> 03:48:14,954
MATT: Yes.

4387
03:48:14,954 --> 03:48:21,179
TALIESIN: We have a mansion that's within walking
distance. And if we have to, we will run.

4388
03:48:21,179 --> 03:48:24,913
TRAVIS: I'm gonna hand her the potion anyway,
as she's standing there, so.

4389
03:48:24,913 --> 03:48:33,082
MATT: Okay. As she finishes healing herself,
Ukurat walks up towards the center of the room

4390
03:48:33,082 --> 03:48:41,318
where you're standing next to her, and just kind
of pushes the currently now-smoldering body of the

4391
03:48:41,318 --> 03:48:46,192
treant to the side.

4392
03:48:46,192 --> 03:48:55,329
"A little late on the call to
arms. I'm just sad I missed most of the fight."

4393
03:48:55,329 --> 03:48:59,999
TRAVIS: Didn't want you to miss out on all the
action.

4394
03:48:59,999 --> 03:49:07,195
MATT: Got a couple licks in. Well. I guess this
calls us even.

4395
03:49:07,195 --> 03:49:11,487
LAURA: Yeah.

4396
03:49:11,487 --> 03:49:12,601
SAM: Thanks for coming.

4397
03:49:12,601 --> 03:49:15,014
LAURA: Thank you for joining us.

4398
03:49:15,014 --> 03:49:17,664
MATT: Be safe.

4399
03:49:17,664 --> 03:49:18,623
LAURA: You too.

4400
03:49:18,623 --> 03:49:22,283
TRAVIS: Wait. What will you do now?

4401
03:49:22,283 --> 03:49:34,080
MATT: "My business is my own. As is yours.
I'll find my people. We'll find a home for us.

4402
03:49:34,080 --> 03:49:37,781
"Now. You've done your task.

4403
03:49:37,781 --> 03:49:44,217
"Leave before you plummet into any further 
unknown dangers, foolish people."

4404
03:49:44,217 --> 03:49:47,935
He turns around and leaps
towards the opening that he carved and crawls out

4405
03:49:47,935 --> 03:49:49,849
of it and just disappears.

4406
03:49:49,849 --> 03:49:51,596
MARISHA: You know, from him I think that was a
compliment.

4407
03:49:51,596 --> 03:49:52,437
TALIESIN: It kind of was.

4408
03:49:52,437 --> 03:49:53,388
MARISHA: Yeah.

4409
03:49:53,388 --> 03:49:55,347
TRAVIS: He's so awesome.

4410
03:49:55,347 --> 03:49:57,607
TALIESIN: It is sort of sad that we didn't catch
any theater.

4411
03:49:57,607 --> 03:49:59,253
LAURA: Well, there's still time.

4412
03:49:59,253 --> 03:50:01,388
TRAVIS: Can I try and jump through the hole like
he did?

4413
03:50:01,388 --> 03:50:04,353
MATT: You reach over and leap through the hole.
Catch it.

4414
03:50:04,353 --> 03:50:06,261
Yeah, it's still open, it's like pulled
open and actually--

4415
03:50:06,261 --> 03:50:08,864
TRAVIS: I don't make it all the way in, though,
do I? It's up there.

4416
03:50:08,864 --> 03:50:12,400
MATT: Oh, no, the hole that he pulled in was the
entrance you walked in to the base.

4417
03:50:12,400 --> 03:50:13,705
TRAVIS: Oh, good.

4418
03:50:13,705 --> 03:50:14,683
MATT: So you get there.

4419
03:50:14,683 --> 03:50:16,120
TRAVIS: Little colonoscopy?

4420
03:50:16,120 --> 03:50:19,523
MATT: Little bit, yeah.

4421
03:50:19,523 --> 03:50:25,374
MARISHA: I go up to Vex and I just grab her arm
and I say,

4422
03:50:25,374 --> 03:50:37,020
Don't let any man-- or anyone for that
matter-- make you feel like you need them to be

4423
03:50:37,020 --> 03:50:46,205
great. Because you don't. I'm not good with
words.

4424
03:50:46,205 --> 03:50:49,850
LAURA: That was wonderful, Keyleth. Thank you.

4425
03:50:49,850 --> 03:50:51,360
MARISHA: But he was an asshole.

4426
03:50:51,360 --> 03:50:53,440
LAURA: No, yeah, he was really... right?

4427
03:50:53,440 --> 03:50:55,632
MARISHA: And I don't want you ever dating an
asshole.

4428
03:50:55,632 --> 03:50:58,868
LAURA: (laughs) Thank you.

4429
03:50:58,868 --> 03:51:01,275
MARISHA: He wasn't good enough, he was mean.

4430
03:51:01,275 --> 03:51:02,934
TALIESIN: I'm going to saunter over.

4431
03:51:02,934 --> 03:51:03,843
LAURA: What?

4432
03:51:03,843 --> 03:51:08,332
TALIESIN: (in an exaggeratedly evil voice) We're a
lot alike, you and I. Bleaaah. (normal voice) What

4433
03:51:08,332 --> 03:51:09,603
an asshole, Jesus.

4434
03:51:09,603 --> 03:51:14,442
MARISHA: (in an exaggeratedly evil voice) You drug
your friends to their doom.

4435
03:51:14,442 --> 03:51:17,753
TRAVIS: Can I walk over to Vax while they're
making a show?

4436
03:51:17,753 --> 03:51:19,818
MARISHA: We keep making a show.

4437
03:51:19,818 --> 03:51:21,091
TRAVIS: Quietly, I say,

4438
03:51:21,091 --> 03:51:26,359
What was he talking about
with the bloody dagger?

4439
03:51:26,359 --> 03:51:29,640
LIAM: Sorry, Feywild interference, what was that?

4440
03:51:29,640 --> 03:51:35,371
TRAVIS: What was he saying about the bloody dagger
when he was talking to Vex?

4441
03:51:35,371 --> 03:51:41,539
LIAM: You know, it's interesting, I understand
exactly zero percent of what the DM was saying

4442
03:51:41,539 --> 03:51:44,294
while he was in-character as that particular
character

4443
03:51:44,294 --> 03:51:47,298
due to the nature of Skype and
microphones.

4444
03:51:47,298 --> 03:51:48,211
TRAVIS: Yes.

4445
03:51:48,211 --> 03:51:51,925
LIAM: So I was faking understanding the whole
time, and then picked it up in retrospect

4446
03:51:51,925 --> 03:51:55,803
listening to Laura's responses. I missed it.

4447
03:51:55,803 --> 03:51:57,412
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4448
03:51:57,412 --> 03:51:58,778
LAURA: Who's this Laura you're speaking of?

4449
03:51:58,778 --> 03:52:01,573
(All laugh.)

4450
03:52:01,573 --> 03:52:05,839
LIAM: I don't know. I don't know anything.

4451
03:52:05,839 --> 03:52:11,693
LAURA: That's okay. It's fine that you didn't
hear. He said nothing about a bloody dagger.

4452
03:52:11,693 --> 03:52:13,660
Nothing at all.

4453
03:52:13,660 --> 03:52:17,204
LIAM: We should find that dagger. No question.

4454
03:52:17,204 --> 03:52:20,325
TALIESIN: Is there anything other than the bow
worth looting on this terrible person, since I'm

4455
03:52:20,325 --> 03:52:21,673
rummaging through his...

4456
03:52:21,673 --> 03:52:23,023
MATT: Make an investigation check.

4457
03:52:23,023 --> 03:52:24,115
TALIESIN: Right.

4458
03:52:24,115 --> 03:52:26,596
TRAVIS: Well, let's not downplay the bow.

4459
03:52:26,596 --> 03:52:27,519
TALIESIN: I've got it already.

4460
03:52:27,519 --> 03:52:30,337
SAM: Hey, guys, I'm still trapped in the vines!

4461
03:52:30,337 --> 03:52:35,037
LAURA: Oh, Scanlan! I run over and I start
pulling the vines off of him. Holy shit, Scanlan,

4462
03:52:35,037 --> 03:52:38,352
I'm so sorry. Thank you for healing me.

4463
03:52:38,352 --> 03:52:39,777
SAM: Certainly.

4464
03:52:39,777 --> 03:52:41,536
TRAVIS: Are you in fine form? Should I hit you
until you--

4465
03:52:41,536 --> 03:52:45,493
SAM: No, don't hit me. I'll sing more Spice
Girls.

4466
03:52:45,493 --> 03:52:46,871
LAURA: That was really lovely.

4467
03:52:46,871 --> 03:52:47,989
SAM: Thank you.

4468
03:52:47,989 --> 03:52:51,840
LAURA: Spice Girls is so empowering.

4469
03:52:51,840 --> 03:52:58,352
MATT: So, you pull the vines from him, as you
inspect around, too, you notice there's not much

4470
03:52:58,352 --> 03:53:08,193
really of worth here. This home is mostly natural
in its base. However, the slow trickle of the

4471
03:53:08,193 --> 03:53:19,328
black oil-like substance has ceased. Most of it's
grown thicker and stopped, and it just feels like

4472
03:53:19,328 --> 03:53:24,262
the whole place went into this sudden stasis,
like the slow crawl of everything nearby,

4473
03:53:24,262 --> 03:53:28,071
the vines, everything stopped.

4474
03:53:28,071 --> 03:53:30,090
LAURA: We didn't kill the whole forest, did we?

4475
03:53:30,090 --> 03:53:31,136
SAM: Little bit.

4476
03:53:31,136 --> 03:53:32,872
MARISHA: I drop to my knees and do a Commune with
Nature.

4477
03:53:32,872 --> 03:53:35,770
MATT: Okay.

4478
03:53:35,770 --> 03:53:40,804
MARISHA: Do I gather a different energy from the
surrounding plants?

4479
03:53:40,804 --> 03:53:47,696
MATT: You still feel the ever-present bloom of
life and life-forces surrounding you entirely.

4480
03:53:47,696 --> 03:53:58,463
You do feel a wave of relaxation. There is a sort
of general radial sigh that is slowly trickling

4481
03:53:58,463 --> 03:54:00,209
from the center of the tree.

4482
03:54:00,209 --> 03:54:02,005
MARISHA: Do I still sense the presence of Sondur?

4483
03:54:02,005 --> 03:54:05,705
MATT: No.

4484
03:54:05,705 --> 03:54:16,357
MARISHA: Do, last question. Does the tree seem
happier? What is the tree gonna do from here on

4485
03:54:16,357 --> 03:54:19,417
out? What are you gonna do, tree?

4486
03:54:19,417 --> 03:54:20,675
MATT: Exist.

4487
03:54:20,675 --> 03:54:24,795
MARISHA: Exist, cool. Everything seems great.

4488
03:54:24,795 --> 03:54:28,177
TRAVIS: Cool. Since I got the killing blow,
can I chop this tree down now?

4489
03:54:28,177 --> 03:54:29,110
LAURA: This whole tree?

4490
03:54:29,110 --> 03:54:30,019
MARISHA: This big one?

4491
03:54:30,019 --> 03:54:31,594
SAM: No, it's just a tree now, I think it's okay.

4492
03:54:31,594 --> 03:54:35,326
MARISHA: Yeah, you know, the tree just told me
that it actually feels much better, so.

4493
03:54:35,326 --> 03:54:36,797
TRAVIS: I get to chop a tree at some point.

4494
03:54:36,797 --> 03:54:38,751
LAURA: You see those trees over there?

4495
03:54:38,751 --> 03:54:41,729
TRAVIS: They're already down.

4496
03:54:41,729 --> 03:54:45,478
LAURA: No no no, I see it twitching, Grog,
it's definitely twitching.

4497
03:54:45,478 --> 03:54:50,980
LIAM: We're going to Vasselheim soon, you can cut
down a lot of trees there. It's cold there,

4498
03:54:50,980 --> 03:54:52,883
they could use the firewood. Soon.

4499
03:54:52,883 --> 03:54:55,426
MARISHA: Trees that won't take it personal.

4500
03:54:55,426 --> 03:54:58,507
TALIESIN: I know that's not nearly as much fun,
but it is available.

4501
03:54:58,507 --> 03:54:59,469
TRAVIS: This is true.

4502
03:54:59,469 --> 03:55:01,278
LIAM: What are we talking about? Vex'ahlia.

4503
03:55:01,278 --> 03:55:02,187
LAURA: What?

4504
03:55:02,187 --> 03:55:04,672
LIAM: I'm fucking curious. Pull that bowstring.

4505
03:55:04,672 --> 03:55:05,476
LAURA: Well, I don't have it.

4506
03:55:05,476 --> 03:55:07,544
TALIESIN: Toss it.

4507
03:55:07,544 --> 03:55:10,281
SAM: Are you sure Vex'ahlia should get it?

4508
03:55:10,281 --> 03:55:11,360
TALIESIN: I know, I was thinking that.

4509
03:55:11,360 --> 03:55:12,846
LAURA: Do you need it, Scanlan, do you think--

4510
03:55:12,846 --> 03:55:15,327
SAM: I think maybe I should get it, I fought
bravely in the last fight.

4511
03:55:15,327 --> 03:55:17,577
LAURA: You did. Maybe Grog should get it, I mean,
he did get the killing blow.

4512
03:55:17,577 --> 03:55:20,620
LIAM: Scanlan, I think you would make a very good
arrow for it.

4513
03:55:20,620 --> 03:55:23,232
(All laugh.)

4514
03:55:23,232 --> 03:55:25,140
TRAVIS: I could get down with that.

4515
03:55:25,140 --> 03:55:29,013
MATT: You hold it in your hand and look at it.
The handle is wrapped with a very tight dark

4516
03:55:29,013 --> 03:55:34,738
brown, black leather, and at the cusp of where the
handle itself is and where the arrow is notched is

4517
03:55:34,738 --> 03:55:43,097
this nice golden-bronze cap-like metallic inlay.
The rest of the bow itself is this curved,

4518
03:55:43,097 --> 03:55:52,719
almost deep verdant green jungle vine-type
texture to it, where it builds on itself like a

4519
03:55:52,719 --> 03:55:59,070
series of natural leaf scales. And as it curves
into the ends of the actual recurve bow,

4520
03:55:59,070 --> 03:56:06,031
as you hold it, it flexes and shifts on its own.
It actually looks, as you hold it it almost seems

4521
03:56:06,031 --> 03:56:15,378
to tighten and then relax, and then as you reach
back an arrow, it goes taut, and the string goes

4522
03:56:15,453 --> 03:56:21,882
extremely tight. As you pull the arrow back,
it's like no strength involved at all.

4523
03:56:21,882 --> 03:56:22,814
LAURA: What?

4524
03:56:22,814 --> 03:56:28,894
MATT: It pulls back on its own, and as soon as you
release, the arrow that you fire shoots off at an

4525
03:56:28,894 --> 03:56:34,636
incredible speed and the actual bow itself flexes
with such intensity that it makes this roaring

4526
03:56:34,636 --> 03:56:37,574
whoosh sound with each shot.

4527
03:56:37,574 --> 03:56:39,662
TALIESIN: Well, that's exciting.

4528
03:56:39,662 --> 03:56:41,585
LAURA: That's really badass.

4529
03:56:41,585 --> 03:56:44,301
TRAVIS: You wanna shoot me with it?

4530
03:56:44,301 --> 03:56:46,641
LAURA: I wanna shoot everything with it.

4531
03:56:46,641 --> 03:56:50,911
LIAM: Do you still need muscle strength to pull
it, or is it just easy-peasy now?

4532
03:56:50,911 --> 03:56:54,100
LAURA: It's kind of easy-peasy. I guess anybody
could pull this.

4533
03:56:54,100 --> 03:56:55,911
LIAM: You're going to have to start doing pushups,
then.

4534
03:56:55,911 --> 03:57:01,074
LAURA: (laughs) I guess I did say--

4535
03:57:01,074 --> 03:57:03,677
MARISHA: Do you want to hit something? Here,
I'm--

4536
03:57:03,677 --> 03:57:05,885
SAM: Do you want to shoot me? I'll be okay.

4537
03:57:05,885 --> 03:57:07,213
LAURA: I'm not going to shoot you.

4538
03:57:07,213 --> 03:57:08,837
SAM: I'll be okay, you shot me before.

4539
03:57:08,837 --> 03:57:09,577
LAURA: No.

4540
03:57:09,577 --> 03:57:10,578
SAM: Right here.

4541
03:57:10,578 --> 03:57:11,485
TALIESIN: You don't know what it does.

4542
03:57:11,485 --> 03:57:13,240
LAURA: Oh, look at that scar, it's beautiful.

4543
03:57:13,240 --> 03:57:14,532
TRAVIS: Can we get out of this fucking tree
first?

4544
03:57:14,532 --> 03:57:16,334
LAURA: You're right, we should probably get out of
here, maybe.

4545
03:57:16,334 --> 03:57:18,999
SAM: Guys. Life needs things to live.

4546
03:57:18,999 --> 03:57:22,390
(All laugh.)

4547
03:57:22,390 --> 03:57:26,326
TALIESIN: I had not had my coffee, I was tired,
there was no bacon...

4548
03:57:26,326 --> 03:57:30,857
SAM: And we are those things. I think we've all
learned a lot today.

4549
03:57:30,857 --> 03:57:32,233
LAURA: We've learned so much.

4550
03:57:32,233 --> 03:57:33,473
TALIESIN: I hate you so much.

4551
03:57:33,473 --> 03:57:35,506
TRAVIS: I walk out of the tree.

4552
03:57:35,506 --> 03:57:38,047
TALIESIN: I need fresh air. I'm done.

4553
03:57:38,047 --> 03:57:42,814
LAURA: What does it look like outside of the tree?
Is the black muck still black mucky?

4554
03:57:42,814 --> 03:57:47,208
MATT: I mean, the whole forest is still just
coated in this horrible thick liquid.

4555
03:57:47,208 --> 03:57:49,246
TRAVIS: Did you loot Sondur's body?

4556
03:57:49,246 --> 03:57:50,874
TALIESIN: I did, but it wasn't much.

4557
03:57:50,874 --> 03:57:54,966
MATT: But when you approached and you inspected
the tree, there was just an ever-constant flow of

4558
03:57:54,966 --> 03:58:01,060
it, of this thick molasses-type material,
just slowly drifting down the tree. You look down

4559
03:58:01,060 --> 03:58:04,490
and a lot of it seems to have stopped and is
hardening, almost like an amber.

4560
03:58:04,490 --> 03:58:07,073
LAURA: Okay.

4561
03:58:07,073 --> 03:58:08,505
TRAVIS: Like Jurassic Park.

4562
03:58:08,505 --> 03:58:09,444
TALIESIN: This is good.

4563
03:58:09,444 --> 03:58:10,645
SAM: (cracks up)

4564
03:58:10,645 --> 03:58:12,320
LAURA: Yeah, at least it's not burying the forest
anymore.

4565
03:58:12,320 --> 03:58:13,635
TALIESIN: No, we did very well.

4566
03:58:13,635 --> 03:58:14,416
SAM: Sweet.

4567
03:58:14,416 --> 03:58:15,978
TALIESIN: Let's go home.

4568
03:58:15,978 --> 03:58:17,496
MARISHA: You guys ready to go home?

4569
03:58:17,496 --> 03:58:21,056
TALIESIN: I'm, well. Do we wanna, is there a
reason to stay or is it time to go home?

4570
03:58:21,056 --> 03:58:22,228
LAURA: Let's get out of here.

4571
03:58:22,228 --> 03:58:23,728
MARISHA: I think I've seen enough of the Feywild
for now.

4572
03:58:23,728 --> 03:58:24,570
TALIESIN: I'm quite pleased.

4573
03:58:24,570 --> 03:58:25,767
SAM: We could stop at that hut on the way out.

4574
03:58:25,767 --> 03:58:26,744
MARISHA: No, no, no.

4575
03:58:26,744 --> 03:58:27,709
LAURA: No no. Not.

4576
03:58:27,709 --> 03:58:28,741
SAM: We never found the theater.

4577
03:58:28,741 --> 03:58:30,928
LIAM: The theater, the theater! What about the
theater?

4578
03:58:30,928 --> 03:58:31,913
SAM: You know what we could do--

4579
03:58:31,913 --> 03:58:33,440
LAURA: Sorry, brother, I think we have other
things to attend to.

4580
03:58:33,440 --> 03:58:38,070
SAM: You know what we could do, Vex'ahlia,
we could go about 200 feet away from the hut and

4581
03:58:38,070 --> 03:58:41,870
you could just--fink!--and see what it does and
then we'll shift out of there.

4582
03:58:41,870 --> 03:58:44,383
LAURA: And then we just shoot out of the Feywild.
How about no.

4583
03:58:44,383 --> 03:58:45,534
SAM: All right.

4584
03:58:45,534 --> 03:58:48,723
TRAVIS: Anybody want to climb to the top of the
200-foot tree to see what the rest of the land

4585
03:58:48,723 --> 03:58:49,557
looks like?

4586
03:58:49,557 --> 03:58:51,120
MATT: (clapping)

4587
03:58:51,120 --> 03:58:51,974
LIAM: I fly up there--

4588
03:58:51,974 --> 03:58:53,298
SAM: Oh! Wait, someone's here.

4589
03:58:53,298 --> 03:58:56,028
MATT: You hear slow clapping from nearby.

4590
03:58:56,028 --> 03:58:57,047
MARISHA: That can't be good.

4591
03:58:57,047 --> 03:58:57,943
LAURA: Oh, no.

4592
03:58:57,943 --> 03:59:05,326
MATT: As you look off to the side of the tree,
rounding the bend, you see a very tall and thin,

4593
03:59:05,326 --> 03:59:15,145
chest-forward, regal-posed, almost elflike but
still exaggerated in the Feylike features.

4594
03:59:15,145 --> 03:59:21,651
Long ears that curl past the head. The head
itself is small with a pointed chin, the eyes

4595
03:59:21,651 --> 03:59:29,009
almond-shaped and wild, curly orange hair like a
lion's mane that goes down to the lower back,

4596
03:59:29,009 --> 03:59:36,440
just up and large, curves up at the very tip.
You see sleeveless silk vestments of blue and

4597
03:59:36,440 --> 03:59:40,567
green billowing freely behind him as he walks up
clapping.

4598
03:59:40,567 --> 03:59:43,173
LAURA: I instantly case Cure Wounds on myself
again.

4599
03:59:43,173 --> 03:59:43,903
MATT: All right.

4600
03:59:43,903 --> 03:59:47,478
LAURA: At a level three.

4601
03:59:47,478 --> 03:59:50,191
MATT: How much do you heal?

4602
03:59:50,191 --> 03:59:52,576
LAURA: 13 plus eight is 25.

4603
03:59:52,576 --> 03:59:54,789
MATT: There you go. 25.

4604
03:59:54,789 --> 03:59:56,039
LIAM: Garmelie?

4605
03:59:56,039 --> 03:59:57,810
LAURA: No, that's wrong. 21.

4606
03:59:57,810 --> 03:59:59,265
MATT: Bravo, everyone.

4607
03:59:59,265 --> 04:00:00,848
SAM: Who is this?

4608
04:00:00,939 --> 04:00:04,678
MATT: Bravo to each and every one of you.
It's been fun to watch. You know, I get so

4609
04:00:04,678 --> 04:00:17,535
disinterested in these lands, and I have to say,
I'm impressed. Well. I wish to say adieu.

4610
04:00:17,535 --> 04:00:19,033
Good luck on your journeys.

4611
04:00:19,033 --> 04:00:20,540
LAURA: Who are you?

4612
04:00:20,540 --> 04:00:27,284
MATT: But I am a simple wanderer. An individual
who sees the landscape for artistic benefit.

4613
04:00:27,284 --> 04:00:31,173
TALIESIN: I knew it.

4614
04:00:31,173 --> 04:00:35,035
MATT: But I'm glad to have made your acquaintance.
It definitely made these past few days absolutely

4615
04:00:35,035 --> 04:00:40,929
devoid of boredom, at the very least, and filled
my sketchbook.

4616
04:00:40,929 --> 04:00:42,084
MARISHA: Garmelie?

4617
04:00:42,084 --> 04:00:45,240
MATT: Is one of my names. I prefer Artagan.

4618
04:00:45,240 --> 04:00:47,189
SAM: Artagan?

4619
04:00:47,189 --> 04:00:53,294
MATT: But Garmelie suits needs here and there.
I go by many names and many interesting--

4620
04:00:53,294 --> 04:00:55,703
TALIESIN: I knew I should've asked for that
portrait.

4621
04:00:55,703 --> 04:00:58,421
SAM: What are you?

4622
04:00:58,421 --> 04:01:03,877
MATT: I'm afraid the time for questions is done.
As your journey has come to an end, and I have to

4623
04:01:03,877 --> 04:01:05,473
be out of here quickly as--

4624
04:01:05,473 --> 04:01:08,131
SAM: I cast Otiluke's Resilient Sphere on him.

4625
04:01:08,131 --> 04:01:10,067
MARISHA: And I cast Hold Person at the same time.

4626
04:01:10,067 --> 04:01:11,863
MATT: (laughs)

4627
04:01:11,863 --> 04:01:17,715
TALIESIN: What? What! What! What!

4628
04:01:17,715 --> 04:01:18,869
TRAVIS: Nice, Sam.

4629
04:01:18,869 --> 04:01:20,262
TALIESIN: No! Oh!

4630
04:01:20,262 --> 04:01:21,802
LAURA: What is he? Who is he? What is he?

4631
04:01:21,802 --> 04:01:22,416
MATT: All right.

4632
04:01:22,416 --> 04:01:23,377
SAM: I don't know.

4633
04:01:23,377 --> 04:01:24,598
MATT: What's the DC?

4634
04:01:24,598 --> 04:01:25,575
LIAM: He's a deity.

4635
04:01:25,575 --> 04:01:26,565
TRAVIS: Hold it, Marisha.

4636
04:01:26,565 --> 04:01:27,493
SAM: 19.

4637
04:01:27,493 --> 04:01:29,039
MARISHA: 19 for mine as well.

4638
04:01:29,039 --> 04:01:30,287
SAM: 'Cause I didn't pull up the Cone.

4639
04:01:30,287 --> 04:01:31,686
LAURA: Is he like a god?

4640
04:01:31,686 --> 04:01:38,802
MATT: Right. So. The sphere appears around his
form, however, Keyleth, your spell does not seem

4641
04:01:38,802 --> 04:01:42,466
to take any sort of hold on him. As it forms
around,

4642
04:01:42,466 --> 04:01:46,549
he's still just standing there unmoved,
hands clasped.

4643
04:01:46,549 --> 04:01:53,466
"That's adorable. So. Where to
now? Where's your journey taking you? I take it

4644
04:01:53,466 --> 04:01:59,127
"this was not your only purpose. Where's your next
destination?"

4645
04:01:59,127 --> 04:02:03,411
TRAVIS: We left an empty grave inside, it's got
your name on it if you don't talk.

4646
04:02:03,411 --> 04:02:04,574
LAURA: Pfff.

4647
04:02:04,574 --> 04:02:10,210
MATT: Please.

4648
04:02:10,210 --> 04:02:14,688
LAURA: We go home. And we kill a dragon.

4649
04:02:14,688 --> 04:02:20,154
MATT: Good. They are fickle creatures. They need
to be taught a lesson.

4650
04:02:20,154 --> 04:02:22,086
LAURA: Any tips?

4651
04:02:22,086 --> 04:02:39,126
MATT: (laughs) Don't be eaten. Um. Do not
misunderstand their intelligence. Some are more

4652
04:02:39,126 --> 04:02:47,883
bestial. Some are more together. Anyway.
If you'd be so kind,

4653
04:02:47,883 --> 04:02:49,787
I'd like to get on with my day.

4654
04:02:49,787 --> 04:02:54,535
LAURA: Wait, one last thing. What is this statue
that you tried to steal from me?

4655
04:02:54,535 --> 04:02:55,622
TRAVIS: (whispers) Nice.

4656
04:02:55,622 --> 04:03:00,865
MATT: Oh, that's a companion. You're welcome to
keep him with you. I just figured since I was

4657
04:03:00,865 --> 04:03:03,940
leaving you soon, I'd have someone to wander at my
side as well.

4658
04:03:03,940 --> 04:03:05,371
SAM: A companion? What does that mean?

4659
04:03:05,371 --> 04:03:06,419
MATT: Yes.

4660
04:03:06,419 --> 04:03:07,578
TRAVIS: A statue.

4661
04:03:07,578 --> 04:03:10,361
SAM: Does he come to life?

4662
04:03:10,361 --> 04:03:12,029
MATT: With the right words, yes.

4663
04:03:12,029 --> 04:03:14,429
LAURA, SAM, TALIESIN, and MARISHA: What are those
words?

4664
04:03:14,429 --> 04:03:20,800
MATT: (laughs) Well. Take some time with it.
You'll learn them soon enough.

4665
04:03:20,800 --> 04:03:25,594
MARISHA: You know, for someone who hates the
theater, you've made quite a show of all this.

4666
04:03:25,594 --> 04:03:28,332
(All laugh.)

4667
04:03:28,332 --> 04:03:30,289
TRAVIS: Oh man. That was a ten.

4668
04:03:30,289 --> 04:03:31,893
LAURA: That was good, that was good, Keyleth.

4669
04:03:31,893 --> 04:03:35,420
LIAM: Yep, yep, yep.

4670
04:03:35,420 --> 04:03:43,473
MATT: Touche, Keyleth, touche. But no, seriously,
I fucking hate the theater.

4671
04:03:43,473 --> 04:03:49,277
You avoided the other one, right?

4672
04:03:49,277 --> 04:03:50,777
LAURA: The hag?

4673
04:03:50,777 --> 04:03:52,046
MATT: Hag?

4674
04:03:52,046 --> 04:03:53,640
SAM: The hut, the hut.

4675
04:03:53,640 --> 04:03:54,622
MARISHA: Wodenna.

4676
04:03:54,622 --> 04:03:55,438
LAURA: The hut.

4677
04:03:55,438 --> 04:03:56,695
MATT: The hut, yes, you avoided the hut?

4678
04:03:56,695 --> 04:03:58,464
SAM: She's not a hag?

4679
04:03:58,464 --> 04:04:03,472
MATT: She's many things, but she's not a hag.
She's an ex.

4680
04:04:03,472 --> 04:04:06,133
LAURA: Oh.

4681
04:04:06,133 --> 04:04:08,050
MATT: Anyway. If you don't mind.

4682
04:04:08,050 --> 04:04:09,276
SAM: One question.

4683
04:04:09,276 --> 04:04:12,949
MATT: (exasperated noise) Now you grow boring and
dreary. I hate boredom.

4684
04:04:12,949 --> 04:04:15,746
SAM: Do you stay on this plane or do you come with
us?

4685
04:04:15,746 --> 04:04:16,987
MATT: No, I stay on this plane.

4686
04:04:17,098 --> 04:04:18,888
SAM: All right.

4687
04:04:18,888 --> 04:04:22,032
MATT: Unless I decide to come with you. But that's
of my own volition.

4688
04:04:22,032 --> 04:04:24,489
Probably when you least expect it.

4689
04:04:24,489 --> 04:04:25,530
SAM: All right.

4690
04:04:25,530 --> 04:04:27,664
TALIESIN: Good day to you, Puck. Good day.

4691
04:04:27,664 --> 04:04:29,208
SAM: What was your name again?

4692
04:04:29,208 --> 04:04:30,612
MATT: Ah, well. Artagan.

4693
04:04:30,612 --> 04:04:33,500
SAM and LAURA: Artagan.

4694
04:04:33,500 --> 04:04:34,950
LAURA: Thanks for the fun.

4695
04:04:34,950 --> 04:04:37,648
TALIESIN: Thanks for the art.

4696
04:04:37,648 --> 04:04:40,816
MATT: Thanks for the memories. Ah, memories.

4697
04:04:40,816 --> 04:04:46,535
SAM: You know, at some point you should ask
yourself why we didn't just kill you and why we

4698
04:04:46,535 --> 04:04:49,853
knew that you were there the whole time.

4699
04:04:49,853 --> 04:04:53,896
MATT: What, you think I didn't let you find me?
Think you could've killed me if you wanted?

4700
04:04:53,896 --> 04:04:57,622
TRAVIS: Artagan. Did you know Sondur?

4701
04:04:57,622 --> 04:05:00,619
MATT: I knew of Sondur, yes.

4702
04:05:00,619 --> 04:05:02,639
MARISHA: Did you know Sorudin?

4703
04:05:02,639 --> 04:05:03,342
SAM: Who?

4704
04:05:03,342 --> 04:05:05,742
MARISHA: Sorudin the Happy?

4705
04:05:05,742 --> 04:05:14,223
MATT: Sorudin I did not know, but I was aware of
the enchantment left behind. But who am I to lead

4706
04:05:14,223 --> 04:05:17,527
a horse to water when you are so determined to
drink yourself?

4707
04:05:17,527 --> 04:05:19,961
LAURA: (laughs) It was great fun.

4708
04:05:19,961 --> 04:05:24,051
MATT: That it was. It was great fun. But alas.

4709
04:05:24,051 --> 04:05:25,282
SAM: All right.

4710
04:05:25,282 --> 04:05:27,946
MARISHA: I have a feeling we'll meet you again,
Artagan.

4711
04:05:27,946 --> 04:05:34,291
MATT: I hope so. It does get ever so boring.

4712
04:05:34,291 --> 04:05:37,759
SAM: All right, I'll release the sphere on one
condition.

4713
04:05:37,759 --> 04:05:40,349
MATT: Yes?

4714
04:05:40,349 --> 04:05:48,123
SAM: I believe you have a quill that belongs to
us. Just a single writing implement.

4715
04:05:48,123 --> 04:05:52,779
We lent it to you, we want it back.

4716
04:05:52,779 --> 04:05:56,137
MATT: It appears in his hand.

4717
04:05:56,137 --> 04:06:00,004
"I'm happy to give it to you, but I'm 
apparently trapped in this sphere of magic."

4718
04:06:00,004 --> 04:06:01,427
SAM: All right, I'll let you go.

4719
04:06:01,427 --> 04:06:02,662
MATT: Thank you.

4720
04:06:02,662 --> 04:06:08,171
SAM: Thank you. Vax. Was this yours?

4721
04:06:08,171 --> 04:06:11,068
LAURA: There's your raven feather. Nice.

4722
04:06:11,068 --> 04:06:21,983
MATT: "All right. Travel safe. Stay alive.
And maybe visit. If you get lonely."

4723
04:06:21,983 --> 04:06:26,126
And he gives a deep bow and just vanishes.

4724
04:06:26,126 --> 04:06:28,061
LAURA: He was fucking cool.

4725
04:06:28,061 --> 04:06:29,836
TALIESIN: Dear god, let's get out of here before
something else happens.

4726
04:06:29,836 --> 04:06:32,976
LAURA: I really liked him.

4727
04:06:32,976 --> 04:06:35,319
MARISHA: Everyone hold hands and say Kumbaya.

4728
04:06:35,319 --> 04:06:38,374
SAM: Okay. Let's go back to our plane.

4729
04:06:38,374 --> 04:06:40,060
TRAVIS: You don't want to see the ex?

4730
04:06:40,060 --> 04:06:41,542
ALL: No.

4731
04:06:41,542 --> 04:06:44,194
MARISHA: We've dealt with enough scorned lovers
for one day.

4732
04:06:44,194 --> 04:06:46,219
TALIESIN: People get bitchy over here.

4733
04:06:46,219 --> 04:06:47,908
LAURA: Where are we popping into?

4734
04:06:47,908 --> 04:06:49,040
MARISHA: I guess Whitestone?

4735
04:06:49,040 --> 04:06:49,828
TALIESIN: Whitestone.

4736
04:06:49,828 --> 04:06:50,577
LAURA: Yeah.

4737
04:06:50,577 --> 04:06:51,690
LIAM: What are we doing, we're warping out?

4738
04:06:51,690 --> 04:06:52,891
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're warping out.

4739
04:06:52,891 --> 04:06:53,861
SAM: Say bye to the Fey.

4740
04:06:53,861 --> 04:06:56,064
LAURA: Hold your hands up, brother, we're holding
your hands.

4741
04:06:56,064 --> 04:07:00,533
LIAM: Yeah, but I'm tangling my fingers up,
if she'll let me, with Keyleth.

4742
04:07:00,533 --> 04:07:01,271
LAURA: Oh.

4743
04:07:01,271 --> 04:07:02,210
SAM: Gross.

4744
04:07:02,210 --> 04:07:02,879
TRAVIS: I let go.

4745
04:07:02,879 --> 04:07:04,216
TALIESIN: Ew.

4746
04:07:04,216 --> 04:07:05,305
MATT: All right.

4747
04:07:05,305 --> 04:07:06,479
MARISHA: I take his hand.

4748
04:07:06,479 --> 04:07:10,310
LIAM: And say, just quietly to the side,

4749
04:07:10,310 --> 04:07:15,375
You know, you've been pretty fucking amazing
lately. As usual.

4750
04:07:15,375 --> 04:07:20,859
MARISHA: I say, You haven't been quite bad,
yourself. And then we go to Whitestone.

4751
04:07:20,859 --> 04:07:26,834
MATT: To Whitestone. The transition takes place,
you all feel the breath fill your lungs as all of

4752
04:07:26,834 --> 04:07:31,728
a sudden your momentum is shot through but a step
forward, and you catch yourself standing outside

4753
04:07:31,728 --> 04:07:36,237
of the Sun Tree in the center of Whitestone's main
area.

4754
04:07:36,237 --> 04:07:37,796
And that's where we'll end tonight's
session.

4755
04:07:37,796 --> 04:07:41,400
TRAVIS: What! Got your bow!

4756
04:07:41,400 --> 04:07:42,508
LAURA: Hey!

4757
04:07:42,508 --> 04:07:43,546
MARISHA: You got your bow!

4758
04:07:43,546 --> 04:07:44,463
TRAVIS: You didn't die!

4759
04:07:44,463 --> 04:07:45,443
TALIESIN: You got your bow.

4760
04:07:45,443 --> 04:07:46,458
SAM: Ooh, there it is.

4761
04:07:46,458 --> 04:07:48,030
LAURA: Ahh, there's the card, there's the card.

4762
04:07:48,030 --> 04:07:51,120
MARISHA: Man, that guy tried to act like he knew
you. Fuck that shit.

4763
04:07:51,120 --> 04:07:52,406
MATT: Ryan, do you have the--

4764
04:07:52,406 --> 04:07:54,225
LAURA: He had so many things wrong.

4765
04:07:54,225 --> 04:07:55,297
MARISHA: Oh, dude.

4766
04:07:55,297 --> 04:07:57,578
MATT: The item list that you found--

4767
04:07:57,578 --> 04:08:00,375
SAM: What does it do, what does it do?

4768
04:08:00,375 --> 04:08:07,401
LAURA: Okay, okay. +3 bonus to attack and damage
rolls. 1d4 lightning damage.

4769
04:08:07,401 --> 04:08:08,902
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4770
04:08:08,902 --> 04:08:15,575
LAURA: I can declare a bramble-shot like you did.
Whoa. Target takes an additional 4d8 piercing

4771
04:08:15,575 --> 04:08:20,213
damage, plus they have to make a strength saving
throw or be restrained.

4772
04:08:20,213 --> 04:08:24,195
MATT: Restrained means it can't move, all their
attacks have disadvantage, and attacks against

4773
04:08:24,195 --> 04:08:28,831
them have advantage, until they break free.
And this is the figurine.

4774
04:08:28,831 --> 04:08:37,343
LAURA: Whoa, this is so cool! Once per short rest,
I can use an Oracle Shot.

4775
04:08:37,343 --> 04:08:38,264
SAM: What does that do?

4776
04:08:38,264 --> 04:08:43,049
LAURA: I can project my sight through my arrow
that I fire from it, for up to ten minutes.

4777
04:08:43,049 --> 04:08:45,069
SAM: Oh, Prince of Thieves-style?

4778
04:08:45,069 --> 04:08:45,929
LAURA: My god.

4779
04:08:45,929 --> 04:08:47,394
TALIESIN: Is that really a thing?

4780
04:08:47,394 --> 04:08:48,325
SAM: I don't know.

4781
04:08:48,325 --> 04:08:49,244
TALIESIN: Okay.

4782
04:08:49,244 --> 04:08:50,120
LAURA: That's awesome.

4783
04:08:50,120 --> 04:08:51,905
MARISHA: That's cool, she's like Hanzo.

4784
04:08:51,905 --> 04:08:52,897
MATT: It's pretty cool.

4785
04:08:52,897 --> 04:08:58,963
LAURA: Imagine from the broom up high how far that
arrow would go. And then when a creature is killed

4786
04:08:58,963 --> 04:09:03,664
by an arrow from this weapon, a single six-foot
tree grows out of their corpse.

4787
04:09:03,664 --> 04:09:05,148
TALIESIN: Yeah!

4788
04:09:05,148 --> 04:09:06,947
MARISHA: Out of their corpse?

4789
04:09:06,947 --> 04:09:08,446
SAM: A Christmas tree?

4790
04:09:08,446 --> 04:09:09,801
LAURA: A Christmas tree.

4791
04:09:09,801 --> 04:09:11,442
MATT: Depending on the time of year, it may be.

4792
04:09:11,442 --> 04:09:14,126
TRAVIS: You don't need the Onyx Dog, why don't I
hold onto that.

4793
04:09:14,126 --> 04:09:15,126
SAM: Wait, you got the dog?

4794
04:09:15,126 --> 04:09:17,354
LAURA: Wait, no, I wanna see what it is.

4795
04:09:17,354 --> 04:09:18,801
MARISHA: Yeah, can we talk about that dog? Can we
talk about it?

4796
04:09:18,801 --> 04:09:19,737
TRAVIS: You don't need it.

4797
04:09:19,737 --> 04:09:20,969
LAURA: I have it.

4798
04:09:20,969 --> 04:09:21,937
MATT: (laughs)

4799
04:09:21,937 --> 04:09:22,990
LAURA: Travis.

4800
04:09:22,990 --> 04:09:24,262
TALIESIN: Roll for it. Roll for it, bro.

4801
04:09:24,262 --> 04:09:26,860
LIAM: More animals. More animals for Vex.

4802
04:09:26,860 --> 04:09:31,789
LAURA: I don't wanna keep it, I just wanna,
I'm the one holding onto it, man.

4803
04:09:31,789 --> 04:09:34,953
TRAVIS: We'll have to tune in next Thursday to see
what it is.

4804
04:09:34,953 --> 04:09:38,298
SAM: Sounds good to me.

4805
04:09:38,298 --> 04:09:40,268
TALIESIN: Stay tuned for another episode of
Critical Role.

4806
04:09:40,268 --> 04:09:44,963
MATT: You're such a terrible person, I love it.
All right, well guys, thank you so much.

4807
04:09:44,963 --> 04:09:47,437
That's the end of this episode, we'll be back
next Thursday.

4808
04:09:47,437 --> 04:09:49,162
MARISHA: Back in Whitestone!

4809
04:09:49,162 --> 04:09:50,733
LAURA: Whitestone!

4810
04:09:50,733 --> 04:09:56,454
MATT: To see what adventures befall Vox Machina in
