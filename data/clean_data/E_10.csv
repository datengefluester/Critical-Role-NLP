stonework. you begin to carve across the ground with a small piece of charcoal that you use for your ritual drawings, this giant, runic circle. you draw points for you to sit and a point for pike to sit as well, to help you focus in this vision. once you've taken the ten minutes to establish all the various material components and littered it with pieces of dried animal matter, some herbs, and lit a small bowl of incense on the side to help you in this spell, you sit down, take your place. pike, you take your place. and you begin to concentrate. you draw the essence of the nature energies around you and begin to project your vision towards the description of this dark horn, pushing what you can best ascertain is the direction of the temple from where this ritual is being conducted. all right, so. given the circumstances... bonus from that, let's make a will save. all right. so. you feel your vision project beyond you. it's a sort of out-of-body experience as the energy that makes up keyleth is no longer given physical form, it's just adrift in the darkness. you feel yourself drawn, pulled almost, like there's an energy that draws you as if poison from a wound. it pulls you upward, and you're looking down over the top of this entire cavern, suddenly. the darkness tends to fade for a moment, and you can make out the general outline of this island. once again, your vision zooms in and shifts. you can look over the city. you can see yug'voril over top. you can see the glowing aspects of the forest surrounding the outskirts of it. and you can see in the center of this ruined city that has been reconstructed in the image of the temple that stands. this giant pseudo-pyramid with a flattened top. you can now see it from the overhead view of this temple. it is actually open, and that strange glowing source of green energy you can see is slowly emanating from the top. your vision is pulled forward again. you feel yourself drawn towards it, and as you come towards the top, you can see: the open portion of this temple's roof is a crossbeam made of gold or brass, and there is some sort of structure hanging from it that falls deeper into the temple. you then move past this into what is the topmost chamber of this temple. it's darker at first, and as your essence tends to coalesce and find some sort of visual here, you can see now, this brass cross-beam that is held aloft in the center of this temple chamber drips down into a spiral of metal, this strange, arcane contraption that does not match any of the construct of this temple previously. it almost seems like it's been a new addition or is taking the place of something else that was a central focus of this chamber. you follow this strange arcane structure. about 15 to 20 feet it comes from the top of the temple chamber to the center, where held aloft underneath it by another 15-foot drop, you see in this dark room a pool of a dull, bluish purple liquid. and it's pulsing with life, and with energy. you now look down, your eyes focus, and in this pool, this ten, 15-foot-wide round pool, you can see this pulse, almost a heartbeat of purplish energy, what look like small purple stones. but they're not stones, they're minds. they're brains. they're essences. and they're all working together, interconnected. you're looking upon the elder brain of yug'voril, the center of the entire illithid colony that resides in the center of this chamber. you can see now this green energy that's being brought down from this metallic structure at the top of this temple is being funneled down over, and is acting as an arcane prison for, the elder brain. it's sealing and controlling, essentially, and what you had gathered from your previous discussions with clarota, this is what has taken the minds of the mind flayers and bent them to k'varn's will. your focus shifts now from the elder brain, and you look around the room, and in the dark shadows of this room, you can see there are cages. there are metal bars. you're unable to really ascertain what the material is, but in each one of these small cages you see some creature. some of this realm, some not. horrible forms: mutated, torn, some missing limbs, some in the process of slowly dying because they're unable to keep a physical form intact. it's a collection, a horrible collection of malformed entities that are being experimented on. pulled apart, put together. this also serves as, seemingly, a laboratory for k'varn. and you feel a presence in the room, suddenly. your essence shifts around and you look in the darkness and you see, slowly drifting out of the shadow, a single gnarled black horn. underneath that horn, you can see now the physical form that it adorns: dark brown leathery skin with slightly pointed edges, almost like scales that form out of portions of this flesh. you see below this horn one large, piercing, sky-blue eye that glances up and meets your gaze. as it does, from beneath that eye, you see a toothy maw tear into a wide grin. and around the outskirts of the singular eye, numerous other eyes shift around. coming into the light, you see now a fleshy ball that is drifting in the air itself under its own physical form. this aberration, this horrible entity is now floating forward. you can see metal plates that are grafted to the physical body of this creature.",0,0,0,1,"Kraghammer",1,2.0669999999991,1026,0.496371552975543,"second_half",NA,"role_play",1499,"MATT"
