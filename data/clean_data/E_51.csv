""survival isn't just chewing meat you find and killing what gets in your way."" ""if you pick a fight that you can't win, history won't remember a blood smear on anyone's boot.""

""we reserve the right of single combat to members of the herd of storms."" ""you haven't been a number within our midst for years, since you decided to lie there and bleed like a goat.""
