"8",51,186.154,187.206,"LAURA","let's do it, oh my gosh. alright folks, let's go ahead and bring us down back into tonight's episode of critical role. welcome back. so, last we left off, the party having found their way back to the city of westruun, which had been overrun by the herd of roving nomadic tribal barbarians and other such brigands that wander the landscape of talâ€™dorei that grog once belonged to, had swooped in and taken westruun after the chroma conclave dragon attack across this countryside. the party had devised a plan to find their way into the town or at least one of them would, distract a cluster of these individuals, these goliaths, many of which are, you know, half-giant goliaths pulling them out of the city into a large pit that had been hidden after being carved by the druid keyleth. scanlan went into be the distraction. becoming invisible, leaping to the center of the main town square, right in front of the margrave's house, where apparently the leader of this clan, kevdak, which has a long history with grog, resides. as part of this distraction, scanlan released a thunderwave and in doing so unknowingly also revealed himself as the invisibility spell went away. and an entire cluster of very angry-looking individuals bared down on him, managed to escape thanks to dimension door, twice and made your way into the partially ruined temple of arathis where you came face to face with a number of refugee westruun villagers and dr. dranzel and kaylee. and that is where we left off so after appearing and having a moment of realizing the scenario, you see a handful of people, most of them filthy, completely beleaguered, and in need of not being in this circumstance as long as they possibly can. and you can see kaylee kinda holding them back defensively and dranzel, having just noticed your appearance and calling out to you with a chuckle, realizing that you're here and kaylee rolling her eyes, apparently unable to really escape through fate, though there is a look, a brief glance of appreciation that at least you're not burnt to a crisp somewhere outside emon. but dranzel walks up to you and is like, as hush as he can be, ""scanlan, so glad to see that you survived. ""what are you doing here?""",1,0,0,0,"Attack_Conclave",4,1.05199999999999,398,0.378326996197721,"proglog",NA,NA,8,"LAURA"
