""will wheaton, how can we make it even bigger ""than last year?"" that's what she said. start now. trend #tabletopday on twitter, because that was awesome. broadcast your plans on the internet, make a video, share pictures, start a blog, create a dating profile for other sexy gamers in your area, whatever you want. celebrate it in your own way, but we wanna hear from you. be sure to use #tabletopday, or @tabletopday to let us know. it is up to you, world. visit tabletopday.com to register your event, or find one near you. you can also download exclusive content and check out some of our favorite games. we will be streaming our own live event, here in los angeles for you to watch. and there will be more on that soon. you love tabletop games, and we love you, so join us in the global celebration, on april 11th. play more games. hey everybody, i'm wil wheaton, and i am coming to you semi-live from the twitch tv set here at the geek and sundry stages in beautiful downtown burbank, california. i am here to tell you everything you ever wanted to know about tabletop's rpg show, coming this june, but were afraid to ask. or have been asking for close to a year and i've been saying, ""we'll tell you at some point in the future."" you can consider this the big announcement. it was incredibly difficult to cast this show. we needed people who were very comfortable improvising, who had experience playing role playing games, and who were available when we planned to shoot the show. it was surprisingly difficult to get a pool of people who fit all of those criteria, and choose the most awesome among them. so your cast playing in this wonderful show are: yuri lowenthal, laura bailey, hank green, and alison haislip. i'm really excited to have these people all together. they're all my friends, they are all wonderful storytellers, and they are going to be a tremendous party of adventurers. i'm only gonna try to kill them a little bit. the most frequently asked question since i announced that there was going to be a tabletop rpg show is, hey wil wheaton! why are you so awesome? the second most frequently asked question is, what system are you using to power this game? first and foremost, i needed a system that was going to support the way i play roleplaying games, and that is telling a story collaboratively with a group of players with me as the gm. i looked at some very well known systems like dungeons and dragons, and savage worlds, i looked at systems that i love, like fate core, and i even looked at the true 20, a d20 modern system. and i really wanted to use something that was released by an independent publisher. i wanted to bring something to the forefront of the roleplaying world that maybe not as many people are familiar with as i want them to be. but i wanna play the way that i played when i was falling in love with roleplaying games when i was a kid. i wanna be able to sit around on a couch and some chairs with my friends, not have to worry about a map on a table in front of us, and just work together to use our imaginations to tell a story. but there's a system that i really love that's elegant, it's easy to learn, it's easy to teach, it's very easy to understand, and it really just gets out of the way when you want to tell a story together. and that is the adventure game engine that green ronin publishing used to drive the dragon age tabletop roleplaying game. i asked the developer three years ago to please make generic, so that we can build a setting and put on top of it. they said actually this is something we really wanna do. and it's come together. we have been able to work together with green ronin to develop the fantasy adventure game engine. this is gonna take a lot of the things you know from the dragon age rpg, and put it all together to support our world, which i have had the best time creating. i sat down three months ago with some amazing writers, and just started brainstorming about what kind of world we wanted to explore. but what i kept coming back to is, i love science fiction, and i love fantasy. why not put them together? why not build a world that is inspired by the 1978 heavy metal movie, and 1980's amazing saturday morning cartoon show, thundarr the barbarian. i thought it would be great for characters to encounter goblinoid kind of creatures, and instead of them using crossbows, they're using laser rifles. i've got it all worked out, we have a huge team of writers that put all this together that built an amazing codex that gave terrific logic to all of these decisions that we made. we're not gonna tell you what they are. you may discover some of them during the course of the season. so what is the name of this incredible world? the title of our show is titansgrave: the ashes of valkana. you can sort of come up with your own ideas about what those words mean. i know, but i'm not telling. 'cause that's not how the wheaton talks. titansgrave: the ashes of valkana will premiere right here at geekandsundry.com on june 2nd. for those of you not in america, titansgrave: the ashes of valkana will premiere right here on geek and sundry on two june. so i hope that you're as excited about this as i am, and i hope that you will tune in, and then watch us for ten straight weeks of incredible high adventure story telling, and until then, play more games.",10476.542,10860.202,383.66,1124,0.00292967731845905,NA,NA,"GUESTS",0,1,0,0
