""survival isn't just chewing meat you find and killing what gets in your way."" ""if you pick a fight that you can't win, history won't remember a blood smear on anyone's boot."" ""the dragon was a stage."" ""i've not bent the knee like you think i have, i've merely let it co-exist for the time being."" ""but let's just say that dragon's days are numbered.""

""we reserve the right of single combat to members of the herd of storms."" ""you haven't been a number within our midst for years, since you decided to lie there and bleed like a goat."" ""but, i can't say i'm not amused by your gall."" ""so, for the purposes of this bout, let it be known that grog strongjaw is a temporary member of the herd.""
