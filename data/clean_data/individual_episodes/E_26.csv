"1","Briarwoods",3,26,1,"prologue","MATT","hello everyone and welcome to critical role: an online show on twitch where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors roll dice and play dungeons and dragons. my name is matthew mercer. i'm the dungeon master. for returning fans, welcome, and for new folks, prepare. a couple of fun things to announce: first things first, unfortunately we are down a percy this evening. our buddy taliesin picked up a con plague in alaska this past weekend. he had a great time, but came back very ill and has been trying to get better, and is unable to make the game tonight. which makes the current storyline a little interesting, but we'll work it out. it's fine. no mercy percy is going to have some business he's attending to. thank the critters for that. that's an awesome hashtag! so taliesin, i hope you feel better. we miss you. next week we continue that arc. let's see, first and foremost, still every 100 subs we get on the channel we have a giveaway to someone who's active in the chatroom. the winner of that giveaway gets a signed picture of the cast of critical role, as well as a signed poster by our amazing artist kit buss, who was with us for our last session. those are both given away to whoever wins that, so keep those subs going. also, there is currently going around a hashtag: no shave 'til 10k. a number of people on the stream are a part of that. all sexes can compete and be a part of this, too. no shave 'til 10k. if you want to be a part of that, go ahead and tweet that out. get that hashtag going and i'll see if i can convince marisha to let me do that. we'll see. at the very least, for my halloween costume. all right, so other cool things to talk about: all of tonight's donations are going towards the extra life charity. the extra life charity is a drive that's part of the children's miracle network hospitals. a lot of great people in the community have been supporting this and we're supporting that tonight. so any donations tonight will go to extra life. also over the next two days, we will also be streaming here at geek and sundry doing a lot of other charity events for the extra life charity drive, including a small dnd game some of us on saturday evening with the vox moronica crew. so that should be fun. come check that out! oh, dungeons and dragons, the official wizards of the coast folks are also doing their extra life stream over the next 48 hours. they're just going to be doing live dnd streams as well. so starting tomorrow at noon through sunday at noon, just constant dnd on the wizards of the coast stream as well. and all of that is going to be raising money for extra life. so you'll have a lot of things to keep you busy this weekend essentially. so there's that. also, we have new york comic con coming up in just a couple of weeks. excited about that, for all you guys. we have panels on saturday. do we have times for those yet?",0,188.121,188.121,560,178.608448817516,NA,"role_play","MATT",0,0,0,1

"202","Briarwoods",3,26,202,"first_half_rp","MATT","okay. so the sigil is there for you. all right. and so as the sage all right. okay. so yeah. not difficult to research. there are a number of books. they're older books and things that were installed as part of the construction of this laboratory for you, and information that you have gathered since. there are various bestiaries and gatherings of information about the dangerous denizens in the countryside around you, and it is a very dangerous place outside of the few points of civilized society that has built up its own defenses. throughout the evening and the morning, you've managed to find eventually a piece that talks about various undead entities and the process of undeath, and necromantic magics that have been perverted throughout the generations to defy the natural cycle of life. you do come across an entry about vampirism. it is extremely rare and was largely thought abolished close to 200 years ago. there are very rare whispers of any sort of cases out there, and usually as soon as something comes to any sort of public knowledge, large mobs gather and whoever was infected with this horrible state was hunted down and killed. what you do learn from this is religious symbology, while classically thought to have an effect on people afflicted with vampirism, actually has no effect. it's more of a superstition, but does not actually have any negative impact on the individual. however, certain things that do render a vampire easier to destroy: the presence of sunlight. anything that counts as sunlight can damage them progressively the longer they're in it, prevent them from restoring their health, and ultimately destroy them and turn them to ash, should they be brought to the brink of death in the presence of sunlight. also, very quickly and consistently rushing water. being held into a rushing stream or under a waterfall would have a similar effect to sunlight. you do also know the stake in the heart is also considered to be a way to destroy them. it does not actually destroy them, but it does render them paralyzed and has to be done when they're in their resting place, within their coffin and/or the dirt that is considered their resting location. usually that is the beginning step: to find and locate where the vampire is resting, stake in the heart, and then carry the body to sunlight or rushing water. and that's how they're permanently destroyed. you also find out that if a vampire is thought to be killed under any other circumstances, the body turns to mist and is nigh invulnerable and eventually finds its way back to wherever they've hidden their resting place to recover within a very short period of time, making them extremely dangerous, unless you have the right situation, the right conditions, to bring them to that point. so that information is now at your disposal.",1670.807,1862.679,191.872,495,154.790693795864,NA,"role_play","MATT",0,0,0,1
