"73","Attack_Conclave",4,40,73,"prologue","MATT","nothing. we're going to jump right into it. all right, guys, so welcome to tonight's episode of critical role. so to get you up to speed real fast: the group vox machina, after finishing their foray in whitestone, finding a member of the council, riskel daxio, was a cult member for this entity called vecna, bringing him to justice and executing him in the throne room of the palace of emon, they discovered during the search the traveling troupe of dr. dranzel's performance troupe, which scanlan used to be a part of. during this time, they hatched a plan to have vox machina seek this house that had fallen into disarray, and the owner disappeared for a while, that may contain some goods. the party went and investigated. they had previously been in the house and were curious as to where it stands at this point in time, especially if more people are disappearing into it. upon going into what was once general krieg's house where they once fought a blue dragon, they discovered the corpse of krieg, long-buried from the collapse of the cavern and picked apart by some other large clawed creature. and immediately got into some sort of a fight with a purple worm and a frost worm that were essentially battling over whatever it was that was moving in that tunnel that seemed to be nice and tasty. these adolescent worm creatures, not even fully grown, proved a nice little challenge, but the party managed to succeed in escaping after killing them, before the mother showed up. they returned to emon, managed to help scanlan's now-discovered daughter, kaylie, out of a little pinch in getting imprisoned after she'd gotten into a major bar brawl. and the party returned to their keep, where they were notified that uriel, the sovereign of tal'dorei and the city state of emon, had an announcement to make in the cloudtop district. so gathered gilmore, gathered the rest of the party, and everyone went to the cloudtop district around noon at the presentational stage not at noon, at dusk. sorry, the other one. so, at which point uriel announced that he felt he was no longer a worthy leader or ruler of this entire realm he has under his watch and is deciding to step down. during this announcement, however, a number of strange entities came through the clouds in the sky as a series of chromatic ancient dragons swooped in and began to destroy the city of emon. many of the townsfolk gathered at that square were immediately killed. the party as well as a few straggling survivors ran away as both the large, gargantuan black and green dragon begin to chase you down. right before they honed in to pick you off, an even larger ancient red dragon shoved them off to head east to continue their plot after slamming down into the center of emon and claiming it as his own domain. the party escaped via the druid's transport via plants spell and just stepped through the tree to land in the center of their keep of greyskull. so now we pick up where that left off. so as you all come rushing through the other side of the transport spell, each one of you comes stumbling out into the center of the temple to sarenrae that's constructed on the base floor of your keep. the sheer intensity and force that pushes you all through one after another, some of you end up tripping and catching yourself, but nevertheless you all make it through safe and sound before the large tree trunk behind you, the portal, snaps shut, the magic exhausted. the adrenaline still pumping in your head, you're all still thinking over and processing what exactly had just happened and what it means.",460.144,696.748,236.604,648,164.325201602678,NA,"role_play","MATT",0,0,0,1

"912","Attack_Conclave",4,40,912,"break","MATT","hi, my name is matthew mercer, i'm a voice actor and the dungeon master for geek and sundry's critical role, and welcome to my short video series for my tips on how to dungeon master or game master your own roleplaying games. so today, our first topic is going to be encounter building. so when you are creating an encounter, a combat encounter specifically for your party of adventurers or space marines or whatever else you are running, you want to consider what kind of terrain or region is this going to have. that's going to go ahead and help you guide what creatures are going to be there, what type of challenges might be in that way. so consider, is it a icy tundra, is it a frozen mountaintop or is it like a hot, muggy swampland, is it a underground cave network? there are actually a lot of these resource books that you can find for these rpgs that will have listings of creatures and monsters and dangers by topography, and by weather, and that's a really cool way to see what indigenous creatures might live there, and that's a good resource to pull from if you're not having any creative juices helping you decide what to put in front of them. secondly, you want to consider how challenging you want the encounter or encounters to be. do you want it to be a really quick scuffle, do you want it to be a series of small battles, as to opposed to fighting in a long hallway, in a spaceship? do you want it to be one giant climatic multi-leveled boss confrontation? once you've made that decision, that'll help you figure out how dangerous, how extensive, and how powerful the villains may be for this encounter. there's a lot of great resource manuals for every rpg system out there that have breakdowns about what creatures are good for which player levels as far as power or challenge and danger is concerned. like, for instance, the dungeon master's guide and monster manual have a challenge rating system. a creature of a certain challenge rating is a decent challenge for a group of four players of that level, and you can slide the scale from there. also, the dmg, or the dungeon master's guide, has a experience threshold table in there as well that helps you build encounters based on the total experience points the creatures are fighting. so those are really cool resources, if you're new to the system and you're still trying to figure out how to balance that properly. over time, eventually you'll just get a feel for it. experience helps you get a little more comfortable with balancing the battle, and you want to make sure you don't kill all your players way too quickly in the game, either. there's also a really good website called kobold fight club, for those who are running dungeons and dragons 5th edition campaigns, that helps them build an entire encounter with the experience table stuff that helps you get an idea of what could and could not be considered too powerful. and don't forget, if you can't find a creature or monster in these realms or any sort of villain that suits your need for the storyline or this particular battle, you can create one. make one up or take something that's there and customize it and alter it, make it more powerful, make it weaker, you know? if you really, really want to run a game that has a bunch of kobolds as the main villain, but all your players are level ten? go ahead and make yourself some more powerful kobolds. you can customize 'em all you want. everything in there is just a baseline suggestion of what they think, or they created initially to be, but you can always scale them, you can make them more powerful, you can add additional hit points, make them do more damage per attack. increase their defenses, give it some hidden resistances or vulnerabilities. you can even create whole new abilities, i customize creatures all the time for my game. i think it, one, makes it more interesting and more customized to the specific encounter and world. secondly, for players who have been playing for a long time and pretty much memorized the monster manual, it keeps them on their toes because they'll be encountering monsters that they have yet to memorize everything about. also, make sure, though, if you do use these creatures and you want them to have interesting defenses and vulnerabilities and the like, make sure you highlight them or note them, it's very easy to rush into combat and forget some of these cool things. so i always use a highlighter and highlight the various notes and elements of these creatures or these combat scenarios that i want to make sure that i remember and recall in the heat of battle. the next note i want to bring up is battlefields. first and foremost, not every game needs a battlefield. in fact, i kind of prefer rpgs that don't have a battle map with miniatures, it's just a way to play. i prefer to keep things in my imagination, but that's generally more wieldy with smaller groups, if you have three, maybe four players. larger than that, it gets a little unwieldy, and me running six to eight players, it has become very necessary for everyone to keep track of their spatial awareness. when you create a map, things to consider, creative terrain. you know, think of where it's are happening, but ways to make it different on occasion, too. you can have straight forward battles with just, here's an area where they fight, here's some hallways, here's some rooms, and that's cool, too, but if you're in an urban setting, have furniture they can use to their advantage, whether it be for height or for setting up blockades. also, consider what other challenges and confrontations they might have with the terrain during the battlefield. is there a giant chasm they have to get across to actually get to the villain while they're attacking them from a distance? is there some sort of arcane field that's locked off a portion of the battlefield and they have to figure out some sort of puzzle during the battle to lock it down? is invulnerable to all damage until they can find some sort of hidden aspect of their soul locked within a nearby battlefield, or is there a bunch of innocents in there as well that are in danger of being killed from the collateral damage? find cool and unique ways to make it an interesting battle outside of a slug fest of hp being knocked away and whoever falls first. mind you, those can be fun, too, on occasion, but you want to make sure to keep things interesting. for those who want to create battlefields, what i use for my battlefields, because it has been requested a few times. you can use easel pad paper, one-inch grid easel pad paper that you can find online, and that's a real cool way to draw on that using markers and create your own battlefields that way. there are great tutorials online too that show you how to make cool battles and interesting-looking terrain with simple hatch-mark shading and minor colors, so i highly recommend that. also, when you're using intelligent creatures, especially monsters or individuals or villains that are understanding their own mortality, they may flee. when they hit about half or a quarter hit points, they maybe want to get the heck out of dodge. so don't be afraid to let your villains or enemies do that on occasion. one, it ups the stakes immediately in a battle from a slog fest to, oh crap he's getting away, and the dynamic shifts to try and prevent them from doing so. and secondly, if they do manage to get away, you may have a juicy villain who can recur later on down the story with a need for vengeance. vengeance! another cool note, not all battles are meant to be won, either. sometimes you want to introduce a really powerful enemy as a foreshadowing aspect, a creature that they can in no way, shape or form defeat, and they are meant to flee from, so that they can build towards down the road, maybe coming back and finally killing it as a means of vengeance. just make sure you try and insinuate to the players that they shouldn't stick around for the whole fight or you might have a tpk on your hands, so be careful with that one. it's a fun tool, but be careful. no, seriously, be careful. plus, it also leaves a cool story like, ""man, you remember that one time we almost got killed by ""that thing?"" not all fights are meant to end in bloodshed, as well. so don't be afraid to let the players diplomatically resolve an encounter. sometimes battles happen because of misunderstandings or misinformation or the wrong thing was said and it ticks somebody off. that doesn't mean they have to fight to the bitter end and murder whoever's in front of them. you don't want the whole murderhobo syndrome to be consistent, unless that's the campaign you're running, in which case, fight on, my murderhobos. but let the players use their social skills to try and defuse an encounter before anyone gets killed. i've many games where halfway through a battle, they're like, ""wait, ""they may have information we need,"" or, ""maybe we were duped and have the wrong information,"" and they decide to diplomatically end it. it doesn't always work, but it's nice to give them that option.
