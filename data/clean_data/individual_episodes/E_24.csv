"1","Briarwoods",3,24,1,"prologue","MATT","hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of critical role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors play dungeons and dragons. i think this is our 24th episode, which is ridiculous. we've been doing this since march, and it gets more and more ridiculous every week. glad you guys can join us. the new guys, welcome to our chaos. for all the old folks, glad you could come and join us again. quick thing i want to mention: last week we were talking about the changes to critmas, because we had stresses on scheduling and we had crew here, and when things go long, we were talking about possibly moving to periscope on a different day, separate medium. well, the fanbase has spoken very loudly and very intently about their reaction to that, and so what we're doing, to still make it so people aren't kept here for ridiculous hours weekly, we're still going to have critmas on the stream, but it's going to be once a month. it's probably going to be the first thursday of every month, and we're going to make it an extensive day for that month where we open everything that evening. we still get to experience and share that with you guys, but also not keep these guys here way too late unpaid every thursday night. so i think that's the plan we're going with forward. hopefully, that's cool with everyone, because we love it, too, and we want to make sure we still share that with you guys. all right, couple of other announcements. first and foremost, i wanted to mention again we mentioned it last week, as well there's that hasbro game design contest, design the next party game. that's still up until end of this month, i believe. so if you want to check it out, you can go ahead and tweet at me, last week's episode or search for the hasbro game design contest. that's still happening. also, there's a film series that i'm a part of called mythica. it's like a high fantasy film series where i play the main villain, the necromancer zorloc. it's fun times. it's like awesome, fun, fantasy genre film. and they're currently putting up a kickstarter to finish the post on the third film, so you should check that out. search mythica on kickstarter and you should find it there. also, welovefine is still running their dnd t-shirt contest for their rage of demons release for wizards of the coast, where you can submit your own t-shirt designs that fit within the rage of demons theme. i am one of the judges on that, so if you submit your art to this, there is a cash prize. all the rules are up there on the welovefine contest site. and i'll be able to judge your artwork and hopefully put you through to the end. so there's that. trying to get through these as fast as possible. our teespring shirt for is it thursday yet? is still up. it has one more week. so if any of you guys want to get the limited edition critical role is it thursday yet? shirt, that is only available for one more week and then it'll be gone forever, so get it while you can. let's see. i'm doing my best to get through this as fast as possible. no worries. not everything. also, ashley's show blindspot is premiering this coming monday.",0,189.214,189.214,606,192.163370575116,NA,"role_play","MATT",0,0,0,1
