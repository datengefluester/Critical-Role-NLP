"74","Daring_Deeds",7,99,74,"prologue","MATT","hello, and welcome back. so, where we last left off, vox machina had discovered that one of their companions, the most recent addition to their team, taryon darrington, had gone missing, seemingly taken by a bounty hunter who had masqueraded as a pastry chef and was retrieving him to be returned to wildmount within the city of deastok to the rest of the darrington family. upon heading them off the pass and retrieving taryon, you all made your way to deastok and spoke with the rest of the taryon darrington family and discovered, it seems, that they have gone into serious debt. there's been a long-running agreement between the darringtons and a criminal syndicate known as the myriad that seems to be very prominent in wildmount. and as the years have gone by, that debt has compounded and compounded to the point where they were threatening to take everything from the darrington family and toss them onto the street. your father, howaardt, told you that his plan to prevent this from happening was to marry you off to a very rich and powerful family up in the capital in the kingdom, and you decided to look for other options. you went and spoke with a gentleman named korshad who was within a secret bar beneath the grumpy lily tavern where a bunch of, it seems, myriad and other lowlives go to drink, be merry, and go about their business in a safer environment. you seemed to talk with him about a possibility of making some sort of arrangement, and an accord was made where if you went and cleansed a nearby platinum mine of herethis, that had seemingly been overrun with some sort of awoken entity that had prevented them from mining the platinum, and are losing a lot of money if you were to destroy this creature or cleanse the mines of the threats to it, they would forgive some of the debt. they would still take the lands from the darrington family, but they would leave the estate, they would leave whatever remains on that land, and would not mess with them any further, thus ending the contract and still leaving a comfortable lifestyle for the family. you agreed to this, made your way to the herathis platinum mines, delved deep into the open sinkhole that seemed to consume a portion of its construct, and discovered what had awoken within, a strange, once-seeded celestial that had been awoken too early and too young. as such, its weird, angelic, baby-like form had withered and twisted, and in battling the celestial, which manipulated the terrain around you, you managed to defeat it and destroy it before it could escape, gathered some of its remaining glittery ashes, if you will, and proceeded to fly up through the sinkhole as the rest of the ankheg swarm that seemed to parade through the tunnels within began to swarm up the sides and spit acid at you as you escaped out the top. into the moonlit sky looking down below, you could see the swarm now crawling up and out of the maw of this mine, and that's where we left off. so as you've all just emerged out of the central portion of the mine, taking a deep breath as you're now suddenly out of the immediate danger, you can look down and see the dozens of large insectoid-like ankhegs now clambering up to the top on the edge, some of them seemingly shooting jets of acid too far away to make any impact, but they are intent definitely on trying to either shoo you off of their territory or hit at some sort of lucky impact. what do you guys want to do?",484.378,701.041,216.663,630,174.464490937539,NA,"role_play","MATT",0,0,0,1
