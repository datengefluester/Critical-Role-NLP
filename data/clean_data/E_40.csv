"73",40,460.144,464.69,"MATT","nothing. we're going to jump right into it. all right, guys, so welcome to tonight's episode of critical role. so to get you up to speed real fast: the group vox machina, after finishing their foray in whitestone, finding a member of the council, riskel daxio, was a cult member for this entity called vecna, bringing him to justice and executing him in the throne room of the palace of emon, they discovered during the search the traveling troupe of dr. dranzel's performance troupe, which scanlan used to be a part of. during this time, they hatched a plan to have vox machina seek this house that had fallen into disarray, and the owner disappeared for a while, that may contain some goods. the party went and investigated. they had previously been in the house and were curious as to where it stands at this point in time, especially if more people are disappearing into it. upon going into what was once general krieg's house where they once fought a blue dragon, they discovered the corpse of krieg, long-buried from the collapse of the cavern and picked apart by some other large clawed creature. and immediately got into some sort of a fight with a purple worm and a frost worm that were essentially battling over whatever it was that was moving in that tunnel that seemed to be nice and tasty. these adolescent worm creatures, not even fully grown, proved a nice little challenge, but the party managed to succeed in escaping after killing them, before the mother showed up. they returned to emon, managed to help scanlan's now-discovered daughter, kaylie, out of a little pinch in getting imprisoned after she'd gotten into a major bar brawl. and the party returned to their keep, where they were notified that uriel, the sovereign of tal'dorei and the city state of emon, had an announcement to make in the cloudtop district. so gathered gilmore, gathered the rest of the party, and everyone went to the cloudtop district around noon at the presentational stage not at noon, at dusk. sorry, the other one. so, at which point uriel announced that he felt he was no longer a worthy leader or ruler of this entire realm he has under his watch and is deciding to step down. during this announcement, however, a number of strange entities came through the clouds in the sky as a series of chromatic ancient dragons swooped in and began to destroy the city of emon. many of the townsfolk gathered at that square were immediately killed. the party as well as a few straggling survivors ran away as both the large, gargantuan black and green dragon begin to chase you down. right before they honed in to pick you off, an even larger ancient red dragon shoved them off to head east to continue their plot after slamming down into the center of emon and claiming it as his own domain. the party escaped via the druid's transport via plants spell and just stepped through the tree to land in the center of their keep of greyskull. so now we pick up where that left off. so as you all come rushing through the other side of the transport spell, each one of you comes stumbling out into the center of the temple to sarenrae that's constructed on the base floor of your keep. the sheer intensity and force that pushes you all through one after another, some of you end up tripping and catching yourself, but nevertheless you all make it through safe and sound before the large tree trunk behind you, the portal, snaps shut, the magic exhausted. the adrenaline still pumping in your head, you're all still thinking over and processing what exactly had just happened and what it means.",0,0,0,1,"Attack_Conclave",4,4.54599999999999,648,0.142542894852618,"proglog",NA,NA,73,"MATT"
