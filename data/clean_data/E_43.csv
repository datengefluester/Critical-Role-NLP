""the titans that walked across these lands, great, primordial elemental kings, beings of no noble ""mind, sought to destroy any light or beauty. thus the first war began. the peoples rose up, the gods' ""feet touched the ground, and alongside their creations they slew the titans, with the first of ""these vestiges. laying them to rest within the dirt, within the sky, casting the elements away ""from this plane, and separate to their own, where now they remain, amidst fire, earth, air, water, ""and their muddy boundaries between. ""thus came a time of great privilege and prosperity. and it also came to be discovered that ""some of the gods, as part of creation during this bout with the titans, began to question the ""purpose of creation, to embrace the chaos that they fought in this battle, and they distanced ""themselves from the ones that guide us to this day. they began to take the children of the gods, ""to corrupt them, teach them the wonders of arcana, magics beyond the divine, the gifts of the gods, ""and for the first time, the creations began to find power separate from the creators. the ""arrogance to think that perhaps, now, they were gods themselves. now, they were the gods' ""creations and they loved them very much, so they did not see this as a threat. but as the second ""expansion of civilization spread across the world, we saw rise great, new towns and cities and ""civilizations and cultures, as well as a new wave of insolence and selfishness. and these new dark ""gods began to prey upon this, and build a force to take those who still stay true to the first. this ""terrible war, this is what we knew as the divergence. this is when the people were split in two. ""the gods were divided as well. bloody battles ensued. and it looked as though, while all other ""cities fell into ruin, even vasselheim would fall. but in this time, these vestiges were expanded ""upon, those first few weapons, many more were created. and the champions fought alongside the ""gods once more. and victory was had, the dark gods banished to various planes, far from this plane. ""but it was then the gods also decided that perhaps their delving had caused this, and they receded, ""leaving the mortals to find their own way, to rebuild a second time, with the warning of the ""dangers of arcane, which vasselheim still to this day holds in its prime oaths. many of these ""vestiges that you seek were destroyed, but some were kept, some were lost, some were entombed, ""some were re-found and rediscovered and used as symbols of power. but since this second spark of ""civilization, the gods felt that the true penance was the destruction of all their people had built, ""and the gods leaving us to our own. thus started the penance, where to this day, we still make up ""for the infractions and sins of our arrogant brothers and sisters of that day. so, since then, ""we've had other new civilizations spring up: wildemount, tal'dorei, syngorn, marquet. these are ""the newer cities of the third age.""",0,0,0,1,"Attack_Conclave",4,8.36800000000039,679,0.0811424474187342,"second_half",NA,"role_play",1557,"MATT"
