"1",8,0,4.435,"MATT","hello and good evening, everyone. welcome to tonight's episode of critical role, where a bunch of us voice-actors get together and play dungeons and dragons crazy, fun, nerdy times. so we are unfortunately missing travis willingham again this evening, because he's a pussy and had to go see avengers tonight, so feel free to let him know on twitter. but anyway, we have a really fun, action-packed adventure as if last week's wasn't tension enough. let's see how the rest of the group manages to recover from their climactic battle at the top of emberhold. but in the meantime, let's go ahead and give you an intro and some of the character backgrounds before we come back.
