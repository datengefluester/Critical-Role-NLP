"280",12,2540.692,2547.955,"MATT","all righty. so! let's move on to the next section here. welcome to the role of a dungeon master, or game master of this. so, there are a number of things that you're required to be when it comes to dungeon mastering. largely, your goal is to be a fair judge. you take all the actions and the activities and the intent and the phrases that the players do, and you judge whether or not it was a good attempt or a bad attempt, and modify a difficulty based on it. basically, for most things that are actively a challenge in the game, you as the dungeon master decide how difficult it is given the circumstance. if it's a really, really weak door someone's trying to kick through, like the door's been dilapidated and rotting, you might say it's pretty easy, so you give it like a score of seven to ten as the difficulty. and then whoever's trying to break it has to roll equal to or higher than that number. if it's an iron-reinforced door, that's gonna be a much higher number. so a lot of what you're doing is you're judging how difficult a challenge currently is versus what a player is trying to do. the player rolls and adds their modifiers, you decide how difficult it is in the back of your head you can tell them if you want to or you can keep it in your head and then roll off and see if it succeeds or not. and then based on if it succeeds or not, you tell the players what the consequences are of the circumstance. really low rolls can make for some hilarious botches; really awesome rolls can make for some great heroic moments. so you wanna judge that aspect a lot; it's a lot of what your job is as a dungeon master. you're also to rationalize the world around them. so if we can keep the volume down just a little bit, guys. it's all good, it's all good. it's all good. so, rationalizing the world around them. now, what i say about that is, when they encounter npcs which is a non-player character, anyone that's not controlled by the players and they have a conversation or they do something in front of them, that non-player character's gonna have a reaction. so you as the dungeon master, or game master, you decide based on what they've done or what they've said, the personality of the character that you're playing, how they would react to that circumstance. favorably, unfavorably. and so a lot of your experience as dungeon master is rationalizing that relationship back and forth. if they're a really charismatic character that comes, reads the npc well and kinda sees that maybe ""they dress well, maybe they like a lot of money,"" and so they open the conversation about money and how they can be paid. that's gonna be a very favorable reaction, so if they're trying to convince the npc to do something, you might consider a relatively low difficulty. if it's a progressive conversation and the player keeps bungling their words or rolling poorly throughout the conversation, that difficulty might get higher and higher by the end of the conversation for them to finally convince them to do something. so, you're constantly gauging how well they're doing in a social encounter versus how easy it is for the npc to believe what they're saying. also, you'll find challenges that are conflicting or versus, where the player rolls versus an npc. an example of that would be someone trying to deceive somebody, to lie to somebody, versus their insight. and so what you'd do is the player, if they're trying to lie to an npc, they'd go ahead and roll, add their deception skill and then me as the dungeon master, or you as the dungeon master, would roll a d20, add that npc's insight skill and if you haven't decided one, you can make one up on the spot based on how insightful that kinda npc might be and compare the two. if they lose, they'd probably believe the player. if they win, they don't and it's your decision whether or not they wanna show that card or go along with it, secretly knowing that they were lying and then have that bite them in the ass later on. so you wanna be a fair judge, and rationalize the world around them and how npcs react to what they're doing. one of the biggest aspects of being a game master, or dungeon master, in my opinion, is understanding that you're here to tell a story and you're here to allow the players to be heroes. the reason you play this game is you want that heroic journey. and there are many people that enjoy games that are very versus, very conflicting, and very, like, dungeon master versus players, trying to kill them, they're trying to survive; and that's totally fine, too, just make sure up front that you and the players discuss what kind of game you want to play. nothing's worse than having a player sign on-board, make characters, get a few sessions in and realize that they're now locked into a campaign that is very aggressive and very fight-and-survive, versus what they wanted was a very plain, happy, y'know, fantasy experience, so make sure that you're very open with your players in the get-go what kind of campaign you want to run. in my opinion, it's the most fulfilling if it's a collaborative experience, where you provide challenges, you provide difficulty, you provide high stakes and there is that threat of death, but you never want the players to feel like you're working against them. you want to be a, kind of, an impartial judge and be firm but fair, which is why it's so scary sometimes when they get close to a tpk, because i set it up a certain way, they play it a certain way and you let the dice fall as it does. or in some cases it works in their favor, like a long-standing boss fight you prepared a lot that they happened to roll really well on and kill your beholder. totally fine. good for them. 'cause who knows what's coming next? so, present challenges, present difficulty, but never really with the intent to make the players feel like they're unfairly being beaten down and you're just trying to kill them off in some power-hungry spree, 'cause it just generally ends negatively and badly. also, in that same vein, you want to reward good thinking, guile, and good in-character actions and roleplaying, and punish reckless, against-character behavior. a good example was pike, as a cleric, early in the game she was, y'know, beginning to be a little cruel and, y'know, while she is a war cleric, and combat and battle is not unfamiliar to her, cruelty was, and unnecessary cruelty began to fall into a negative point of favor with her deity, sarenrae, causing the holy symbol to begin to crack and we're kinda seeing where that's gonna play out down the road. conversely, if someone does something really cool in-character or something that really kind of changes the dynamic or has everyone else at the table going like, ""whoa,"" that's really great and maybe you want to reward them with an inspiration dice, which is if you guys have seen the inspiration mechanics you can lend inspiration dice to players, which allows them to give a bonus to one of the rolls they make. our bard, scanlan, can give those out as an ability, but you as the dm can also give those out if somebody does something really cool. and if someone does something really risky, but really crazy dynamic, even if it seems near-impossible, let them try, let the players try things that are crazy. they might have a really low chance of working and they'll fail spectacularly, and those will still make for great stories and great memories in that game. so, y'know, let the players be heroes, present them with challenges, reward them for good in-character decisions, and try and detract them from making out-of-character decisions that take and rob the fun from the other players, as well. i mean, everyone can play as they want to. if you're running an evil campaign or you have an evil character in a game that's, like, starting to undermine the rest of the party, that can be interesting as long as all the players understand and are down with that type of experience. once again, that's the conversation you have at the beginning about what everyone's trying to get out of the game. then, another job of the dm, and one of the other larger jobs, is you build the world. you build the world, you help the players tell the story and you work together to find where the story's going from there. i'll get into more detail with that shortly, but you this is your tale. you can either buy an existing module which has a pre-built world and you can customize it however you feel; you can play it stringently as to how the module's built; you can expand upon it; or you can do what i do with this and just build everything from scratch and see where it goes. it's a lot of work and the dm does have a lot more time they have to put into the game, but it's, in my opinion, one of the more fulfilling experiences you can have as a gamer, because you get to watch all these people play in your sandbox and build their own sand castles and it's kind of exciting to watch them flourish in your own creative space and play off of you. so i, y'know, while i do complain on occasion i don't get a chance to play too often, the experience i have watching other people, y'know, find these moments, they y'know, it's to me, it's fascinating and very rewarding, so i know it's a lot of front-loading on this, but just trying to explain to you the gist of this. so as a dungeon master, you want to be a fair judge; you want to rationalize the world around them; you want to try and make sure the players have the opportunity to be heroes and have those heroic moments; reward them for doing good, cool things; try and detract them from ruining other people's fun or doing things that are out of character; and build a world for them to play in. so, in these books, and in any rpg book, there are many rules about how to do combat, how to do social interactions, and you can read up on that. you can take a look at what's in there and, understand, you can play these by the book, completely as they are inside, and it's a great rule system, it works really well. but everything in here, in all these books, are guidelines. anything can be changed, anything can be altered, anything can be customized to how you want it to be. if you don't like how movement or actions work in the game, you can change it however you see fit and just notify the players that's the case, of course, otherwise they might feel a little, y'know, taken advantage of if they don't understand the changes you've made but, you can change and alter anything you want in the game. it's just guidelines for you to play off of. i know i've homebrewed a few things and occasionally aspects of being used to pathfinder bleed over as well, but you just take it as it comes. the bottom line is, as a dungeon master or as a game master, it's your world and you can your word is law. people can't really argue with you unless it's a rules question that you didn't clarify before, in which case you kinda have to go in the favor of the player if it's something you didn't clarify, but for the most part you play the part of the overall god of this world and the players also have to respect that what you say goes. that's kinda that weird dynamic between the players and the dm, it's kinda it's a respect mechanic, you don't want the players to lose respect for you because then they stop well, partially enjoying it, but also they start feeling that antagonistic relationship which can be a little stressful for both points. so, customize the rules as you see fit. we homebrewed percy's gunslinger class over from pathfinder, because we just when we converted over, there was no equivalent and so we made something up, and we're trying it out, it's a work-in-progress, it's by no means perfect but it seems to be doing okay and it keeps it fun for him without completely changing the dynamic of the character he already created. i know they'll probably release a gunslinger equivalent in the future or something and it might be vastly different from what he has, but we're gonna stick with this because it's what he's used to and it's what he's built his character's personality and combat around. so yeah, just keep that in mind. the next bit, and this is kind of a big suggestion point for a lot of you guys. a large part of the dm's time is spent worldbuilding. i say worldbuilding, it's creating all the little details and the aspects of the world you want the players to play in. there are parts that, like, creating a society, building towns and villages, designing dungeons and encounters, all that crazy stuff all comes together into that world that you're creating. shh shh shh shh shh shh shh. thank you. we have to keep everything down a little bit. but you want to start somewhere and it seems very daunting as a dungeon master, especially a new one, to say, ""how do i how do i create all this how do i where do i start?"" and that's a difficult question. sometimes, for your first couple games, it doesn't hurt to look at a module, go out and pick up one of the existing dungeons and dragons adventure books that outlines for you how a city would be built, how npcs would be built, and how they would play out and respond to certain circumstances. it's a good way to train yourself to see how that process would look when it's finished, so if you decide to create your own campaign or customize aspects you know where to build off of. if you're building your own world, i'd recommend starting with a small society, a small village or a small town. and you're like, ""okay, i'm gonna build a small ""town. where's this town gonna be? what's the topography?"" you're like, ""okay, it can be like in ""a middle of a forest village,"" that'd be more natural-based, kind of farmer society. or it could be your archetypical urban environment with a very thriving trade society, a mercantile-run, y'know, people. it could be a port town, it sees a lot of trade but also has that kind of travel aspect, it's a mixing pot of cultures. or it could be just a small farm town that's constantly under siege. but you want to start with some bastion of civilization, some place where the players can meet other characters, find adventure, find quests and find conflict. so you decide, ""okay, where do you ""want this small town to be?"" as an example, we'll say this is y'know, we'll use the first town they started in the campaign: stillben. stillben i built as a swamp town. it is a port town, but it's built in this clutch center portion of a large swamp to the far east of that continent, so you're like, ""okay, it's a swamp town. how big is it?"" you think about it. you're like, ""how many people ""do you think live there? let's say, maybe maybe 600 people."" it's not a huge town. it's not very happy living conditions 'cause it's very humid there. the swamp air itself is not very enjoyable to be around, so it doesn't have a huge population, but those that do live there, consistently, they make a good living 'cause they can live through this whole horrible-living swamp experience and can make use of the trade that comes through. so you're like, ""all right, about ""600 people or so."" then you start breaking down into what factions there might be in that city. ""is there a thieves' guild or an element of shadow in the town? is there a merchant guild? is there a ""builders' guild? is there a sailors' guild?"" think of what type of work would be available in this town and you start building factions based on that. when you have a faction, then you can start fleshing out npcs, or non-player characters, that fit in that faction. ""is there a thieves' guild? ""how many people in the thieves' guild? would it have a leader?"" you don't have to worry about fleshing out every single member of the thieves' guild, but consider like two or three main npcs that might be part of that thieves' guild. so you can say, ""all right, one of them will be, we'll ""say, a female tiefling who's good with longswords."" she's trained into longswords. you're like, ""all right, cool."" so you can just write up her name. come up with a random name you can look up online for random npc name generators and write down her name. we'll say, for this, she's taken her ""virtue"" name of edge. we'll call her edge. so, edge is a female tiefling leader of the thieves' guild. now edge, what about her, aside from being good with longswords, is a dynamic aspect of her personality. well, is she ornery? is she very sly and charismatic? is she the kinda person that lets everyone else do the dirty work and just stays in the shadows or does she like to be kind of the face-man of the thieves' guild? kinda just decide some sort of a personality aspect to her of those or many other types. you can go ahead and say, ""all right, we'll ""say she's charismatic as some tieflings get a bonus in charisma."" so she likes to be kind of the speaking mouth of the thieves' guild. so you'll say, ""she's charismatic; she's well-spoken; and ""she does well in social environments."" a few quick notes about her personality just to remind you later on, if she pops up, how she would play out. ""she's charismatic."" then you think, and this is one thing that i think every npc you should write down some aspect of, ""what do they want? and what ""do they fear?"" you can make a shit-ton of really simple npcs with just the information of their name, what race and class they are, what they want and what they fear; and that's all you really need to branch out any conversation or encounter they go through. so for edge, what does edge want? edge wants respect and money. as edge respect and money, 'cause as the head of a thieves' guild those are the two things that guide her. yes?",0,0,0,1,"Kraghammer",1,7.26299999999992,3424,0.471430538345042,280,"MATT"

thieves and folk that fear her because it allows herself to feel like she's in control of an aspect of her life. these are all different possible fears you can go with. i'm gonna say she fears being found by her demonic father. and so, those notes there say she's a female tiefling, she's a rogue with longswords, she seeks money and respect, she fears being discovered by her demonic father. these are all you need to now play that character and you just need to put those notes aside. and if the players ever find their way in that town asking around and discovering where a thieves' guild might be or if they're finding where, like, they can find a fence to sell stolen goods to or to find information about the seedy underbelly of the nearby town of stillben in the swamp, they might find different people willing to give that information depending on how their social rolls are. if they're persuading well or, if persuasion doesn't work, you can intimidate the information out of somebody in which they scare someone enough to eventually give up a name, and they'll say, ""edge. edge is ""the one you want to talk to."" when they ask around and start finding more information about edge, they could decide to infiltrate the thieves' guild and find her personally. that might be a little aggressive and you consider, ""if a person breaks into a thieves' guild, the thieves' guild will ""take that as a sign of aggression and will probably meet them with battle."" if they instead try and find a member of the thieves' guild and parley with them, they could persuade them to speak to edge on their behalf, in which case they might actually have the opportunity of speaking with her one-to-one in a not-quite-as-aggressive circumstance. it can go any which way and that's kind of the the interesting part of being a dungeon master is you never know what the players are gonna do. you set up these characters, you set up this world and you kinda let them play, and all you're doing is reacting to everything they do, rationalizing how the world would react to what they're doing. so, let's say the players are like, okay, they asked around, they found somebody who did some work with the thieves' guild, they intimidated some information out of them about edge; you then find somebody you think may be associated with the thieves' guild and you pay them a lot of money and persuade them to go ahead and speak to edge on their behalf, asking that she would meet with you at this inn at this time. your party then goes to that inn room and waits for a while. over a short period of time, it seems like she's not gonna show up, based on how you think she would react to that experience. i'd say she's curious enough that someone sought her out that she would want to hear what they have to say, 'cause there might be money in it. let's say the party has gained some renown in the local village, perhaps she wants to align herself with these upcoming adventurers, there's always money to be gained there. so you have her knock on the door. as the party enters the door, there's nobody there, but at that same moment they hear the sliding of glass, turn around, notice that she slipped in through the back window and is now leaning against the back wall with her arms crossed, waiting expectantly for them to start the conversation since they so openly sought her existence. so now they're in a conversation with edge. you can decide how to play their personality. if you want her to be as charismatic as you said before, she would bow deeply; you could say that she was happy to introduce herself and, while hearing some things about the party, she's eager to understand what it is they might have to do with her. let the party explain now what it is that they want from her. then you decide: does it fall within the respect and money she wants? she could tell them, ""i'll help you ""with this circumstance, as long as you pay me this much."" or, conversely, ""i'll help you with this, ""as long as you can talk to so-and-so in the town and get them to drop this bounty on my head."" y'know? you think of what things would fall into her wants and needs the party could do for her and in turn could help them. however, if they've talked around the town, they may notice that she has demonic lineage, and they might bring it up in conversation and see her reaction. she might be very good at hiding that aspect. she might be able to, y'know, to say, ""well, yes, i'm a tiefling ""indeed, but, y'know, that is not of my own doing."" the players could then go, ""huh. she seems uncomfortable. i'm gonna roll an insight check on this,"" then roll an insight check they roll a d20, adding their insight skill. the dm then, you, privately would go ahead and roll a deception roll, or a persuasion roll depending on what you thought was the circumstance for that, versus their roll and let them know what they read off of her awkwardness. if they roll really low, you'd be like, ""she just seems put off by the fact that you've never seen a tiefling."" if they roll really well, you could tell them that at the notion of tiefling and demonic blood, she fidgets and looks over her shoulder, seemingly like she's afraid something's following her. then the party can press her in that regard, and begin to say things like, ""well, if you aren't gonna help us, we have ""a warlock friend who does dealings with the infernal and we know your name now. if there's ""someone chasing you, y'know, we could call them on you unless you help us."" now it becomes as opposed to a persuasion, it becomes an intimidation-based experience; and if they can manage to convince her to help out of sheer intimidation and fearing for what she doesn't want to happen, she becomes an ally, although a much more tenuous relationship. so that's an npc that i just made up right now and fleshed out. but really, the basis you need for an npc, to build off any of those circumstances, is: a name, a race and class, what they want, what they fear. those are some of the biggest things you need to everything else can be improvised on the spot. like i said, it's all reactionary as a dm, which is great, because once you set the world, the players drive the story, and you just react off what they're doing and rationalize how the world would react to it. i understand this is a lot of information up front, but i'm trying to get as much information into this talk as i can 'cause we have a limited time and i've had a lot of questions today i'm trying to get through for you guys. so i hope this has been helpful. we'll get to questions in a second so i can answer things specifically to you. so that's an npc you can create. you can create the same way for like a local cleric, a barkeep. you could be like, his race, he could be a dwarven barkeep. he's not even a fighter; or maybe he once was a fighter, but he gave up the life, used his winnings in some sort of a brawling ring when he was younger to buy this tavern, and that's all he really does, but he's well-connected and has information. what are his wants? he wants money, but he also wants to possibly purchase a tavern across the town that is failing that he thinks could expand his business. what does he fear? being closed down, or possibly getting arrested because of maybe some things he did in his past that are a little shady that he hoped nobody would remember. so now, when someone talks to that innkeep, there are many different ways they could take that conversation, and many different little ideas you might have as gives as to what they're seeking and what they're afraid of. and those are just cool little notes you make to yourself down the road that if they ever decide to enter that tavern and talk to that npc, you look down and you immediately know where they stand, what they want, what they don't want and how they can help or hinder the npc or the players based on what they do. so that's building a very small town and a small npc. you flesh out a couple and then you build off from there. and it takes some time, y'know? you can crank out a few npcs; and you can railroad it as much as you want to. if you don't want to spend a lot of time building a big sandbox game for all your players, you can play a pretty standard, straightforward story. you can decide the players are gonna go to this tavern; the players are gonna go to this, y'know, this home here; they're gonna go to this one mercantile this kind of textile warehouse where they're gonna find a hidden underground passage that leads to an altar to some forgotten god. in which case you can decide, no matter what happens, you can send the players let them wander a bit and have fun, but let them know very early in, ""you hear that there is some shaky business going on in this town. people in the ""tavern are whispering about these murders that have been happening in the village. you're like, 'huh?'"" they'll start asking about the murders and that's when you can point them towards, ""well, ""we've only heard, y'know, that these people have been being killed when passing around this part of ""town; and they arrested one man last week, but he was let go from the suspicions and he lives at ""this house."" now the players will be like, ""oh, well we have to go talk to the guy at that house."" you lead them to that house. they go talk to the guy. the guy might be like, ""i don't know what ""you're talking about."" you press him for information, you find out that he used to work for this textile business and he eventually you can either drive that he helped with these murders or that he knows who is and they work with this mercantile. then, now you send them straight to this warehouse that contains all this, y'know, cloth and textile woodwork-type materials. they might break inside, search the place, find nothing, but if they roll well enough they'll find the trapdoor that leads down into the altar. so, that was an example of a very thorough line to a story that you could drive them towards and let them play within that zone. if you have a lot of free time, you could build that; you could build one storyline that deals with one of the local lords that is in danger of having his home completely taken by him because of debt; or you could do another side-story at the same time that has something to do with a local inn, that their basement has recently had a sinkhole collapse underneath the bottom of it that opened up a cavern of a bunch of strange, mutated, y'know, rats that are coming out of some terrible-smelling cavern. and all of these can be just aspects that are in the town at all given points in time the players may find. and you let them discover that. it still takes a little more time to prepare that, but that's up to you as a dm as to how much your free time is and how much you can prepare for. y'know, don't be afraid to, if you don't have a lot of time, to railroad the players a little bit, as long as you make them feel like they're they're in control of it; and they are in control of it, too. and i've had a lot of games where i've prepared a bunch and the players decided to go this way, and completely get around everything i prepared and it turns into this big improvisation experience. and that can be very uncomfortable for a lot of people that aren't experienced in a lot of improv, and that's where preparation comes in and kind of your comfort as a dm. i recommend, if you're playing and dming or gming a game for the first time, maybe run them through a story that's a little more linear, a little more direct, so you just get more comfortable with the experience, both combat with the players, more experience with how npcs interact with them and being prepared for those circumstances. then, as you have more experience as a gm or dm, you can begin to be a little more freeform with your storytelling setup and letting the players kind of play in that sandbox that is the world you've created. so those are some guidelines for like a small village. the factions are fun to create, because you can have factions that are allied, factions that are enemies, and that automatically leads in a really cool idea for some story hooks where you have maybe a thieves' guild has a huge rivalry with the mages' academy. one believes that, you know, shadows is a real way to get business done in the local politics whereas the mages feel that it's more arcane understanding that both socio-political aspects can be controlled by the arcane. maybe you have one played against the others. the players can choose a faction to align with and there's a whole quest line that way. but now they've made enemies with the opposite faction and now they're having to steer clear of their side. or they can try and double-agent for both but if that ends up going horribly awry they have now earned the anger of both sides and might have to flee the town and never return. so these are all different cool ways that you can set up faction versus faction or factions working together to give the players story and investment in the world that you are creating. now, from that small town, you can build an even larger city. meaning all those same elements i discussed you just expand upon. you build more npcs. you build an entire district that is shops and stores, maybe in a giant bazaar. you can create a whole district that is just about worship of different gods and deities, and you have different temples assigned to each god and you can find, you can use the gods that are in the book. you can create your own gods that have their own backgrounds and specialties and guiding principles and religions around that. it's up to you. but as you build a larger city, you have to consider how many different people and cultures it's now having to house and facilitate. so it's a little more of a time investment to build a city that much larger, but it's a really cool experience to then have the players wander through that, to continue to discover. like, the main city of emon, which you guys have heard about a little bit of, but i'm sure we'll come back to soon in the campaign, you guys will have the opportunity to see it in person, is a vast city. much like the classic baldur's gate or neverwinter, it's the central capital city of this entire region and they've only maybe experienced a fifth of it after a whole almost entire year of exploring it, so there are a lot of examples of that urban expansion that they can go through. and to be perfectly honest i've detailed and fleshed out maybe about a third of the village with loose notes for all the rest. so if suddenly one of the players veered right again and decided to go all the way to the far northern slums, which i have nothing really specifically planned for, i can look through my notes and find out a handful of npcs and some loose story elements that i made notes of about those northern slums and i can kind of improvise based on those notes and where they want to go in the story to still make it a fleshed out story, and if it's a really heavy story thread that they're following i can just find a way to tie it back into the original thread i was trying to tell, and not necessarily guide them back on the path, but have it still fold into the same story they've been discovering. you never quite know where they're gonna take you. sometimes the players take you on a ride and you just kinda have to go with it. you don't want to deny the players too much, because you're all in this for that storytelling experience, and they want to feel like they're guiding their own path. if you force them too hard against their wishes in the game, then it feels more like the dm is playing the game than the players are, and that becomes a very tenuous relationship going forward in a campaign. the cool note is, the players never know whether or not you're bullshitting or you had it all planned, so even if you go off the rails, as long as you have some notes or are at least acting like you know what you're talking about, for the most part you'll be fine. i've had whole games that have gone by, i've run by the seat of my pants improvising and i just, i don't know what's going to happen and it works out in a really crazy way and finds a whole new story path and you just don't tell the players that that happened. that's a fun little aspect there. so we talked about urban environments. we've talked about cities a bit, you know, which, in those cities you want to also be mindful of what ruling class there is. is it an oligarchy? is it a lordship? is it a kingdom? is there an elected official? is it a township? and that political structure will also be a very, very good way to build those factions below it as well. so the larger your city is, the more elements of that social structure you have to consider and how many layers there are beneath it. is it a very wealthy city universally? is there a very, very, you know, high disparity between the upper class and the lower class? these are all really cool ways to flesh it out and give you ideas on where npcs can be and where tension is in that society. also remember, just because you're in a city doesn't mean there aren't dungeons. castles and keeps have dungeons. some cities are built on the ruins of older, older cities that may have underground cavern networks that have been long forgotten or tombs that haven't been touched in years since a strange wave of necromantic energy began to rise things from the grave and they just seal it off. but who knows what lurks beneath there. or, like earlier at that tavern i told you about that had a strange sinkhole, that's a really cool story arc to lead into an underground cavern network to something that may have caused the sinkhole. something long forgotten beneath that inn that now threatens the inn or possibly the town its entire self. you know, don't be afraid to have players in a city environment still find creepy, interesting, weird terrain within that city environment. in emon the players managed to fall through a cistern into a deep, dark underground cavern network that led them through an ancient ruined city, finding a hag that managed to make a proposition with them, whereas for information leading them out she took a bit of tiberius' luck he still doesn't know what that means and it still floats above his head. i think he's forgotten about it, but a portion of his fortune has been stolen by this hag, it still resides in that realm. so, urban environments can be urban but don't be afraid to explore avenues above and below. how you doing? how we

"288",12,4562.655,4570.619,"MATT","cool bit. i'm gonna finish up here real fast with some other ideas. so those are cities. those are towns. what makes them so special is, in the d&d world, and in a lot of rpg worlds, outside of those bastions of civilization is a very dangerous world. and you can change that up however you see fit, but i find that it definitely makes for a better environment if the players understand that in the wild you find things that are wild. there are creatures that roam free. there are monsters and beasts that call these places home and need to eat and survive. there are intelligent entities that are building their own civilizations in the darkest depths of the mountains or in the shadowed patches of the local forests and going outside of a town, most traveling caravans need to have muscled support hired to come along the way. if you travel alone there is always the possibility of bandits ransacking you on the road or some sort of large hulking beast comes tumbling out of a nearby cavern structure and attacking the, you know, the people. there's so many different ways that you can incorporate a dangerous, wild world around these bastions of society, these little points of light, that makes the game feel more dangerous. it heightens the stakes for the players whenever they have to travel, and it makes returning to a town that much more of a breath of fresh air. then, consider villains. villains are npcs that inherently have very selfish goals that are detrimental to society at large and/or the players. k'varn being the big bad of the recent arc. he is definitively one of the main villains if not the main villain of this arc. you can create villains that are kind of one-offs like this. they eventually found k'varn and they killed him. you can create villains that are long-standing and recurring. like earlier in the campaign, the dread emperor was always present, but they didn't even manage to find him until the very end. that was a recurring theme throughout, kind of built that tension about that villain. and not all villains get killed. some villains, when they're damaged, they get the heck out of dodge and return later even more prepared and more ready, you know. but sometimes the players can be clever and keep them in there and don't deny the players if they're really smart and prevent your villain from escaping when he tries to. 'cause you don't want you want to reward the players for being really smart. remember, good villains are also very smart and usually have a pretty strong exit strategy if everything goes to shit. so villains are a really cool thing to flesh out their persona and their personality. you look at a lot of great literary archetypes that can expand on that for you. you consider like, you know, the chaotic evil-type villain, which is the joker from batman. someone who just like loves the idea of violence and destruction and ruining the world around them for their own personal enjoyment and personal gain. you have the lawful evil villain more of the darth vader types that work in a structure of law but use it to their advantage. they twist people's ideals of honor and society and relationships to put them in a position of power in which no one can really contradict, what they say goes. and through that, they maintain power and they maintain control over people around them. then you have just general evil. you have all sorts of different types of evil archetypes you can play with in there, but have fun fleshing out a villain and having them be as sadistic or as controlling or as charismatic and enjoyable for the players to encounter, as much as they hate them, you know, you can have a vast variety from there. but recurring villains are a fun theme and generally up the experience more than just having a big bad every session that they go in and kill, get the loot and leave, you know, it's fun to have that recurring element. i'm gonna cruise through a couple of points here for you guys, so we can start getting to these guys to playing here. or any questions they have for the story. story hooks. story hooks are essentially what gets the players to start seeking the story, and there's a lot of great examples in the dungeon master's guide here, if you guys pick up a copy, that explains a lot of different ideals of how you can get the players invested in your story. let's see if i can find it real fast back here, but essentially a story hook could be when they enter a tavern they notice that someone in the corner is hunched over and eventually falls forward off their stool. the party goes and inspects and finds out that they've been stabbed and are bleeding out, and in their dying words they reach up to the player. they whisper a name, like, oh shit, what is that name? what does that mean? and someone in the room is like, that name, that's the name of the leader of this one temple of pelor, the god of the sun, the god of light. okay, well, the players now have the idea that someone got murdered and their last words were the name of this person. let's go find out what their relationship was. that's a story hook. someone got murdered mysteriously and you only have a name to go off of. that's an example of a cool story hook that the players might be interested in pursuing. some players might be, ""ah, fucker died. whatever."" and that story hook goes away. but that's up to the players and that's going to put them in the territory of being a little more neutral to evil than good players. so if they make good characters and they do stuff like that, repeatedly, they might start pushing into the evil territory and maybe drawing the ire of other npcs nearby that are good. the captain of the guard rushes in and inspects, ""what happened to this man?"" and you're like ""i don't know, he died."" he's like, ""grrr, i ""don't like the look of these people who don't care about the lives of others."" maybe going forward, whenever they encounter the captain of the guard, he immediately mistrusts the party, and they've already established that relationship negatively. so let's see, what's some other good examples of story hooks they have here in the book? 71 and 72. we'll see if they've got that up. all right, bear with me as i pan through. and like, there's a lot of great breakdowns for villains and npcs and stuff in the players' handbook, guys, so if you're planning to dungeon master a game i highly recommend you read through. it's a really, really great resource. ah, all right, 71. all righty. so there are a bunch of cool dungeon goals and wilderness goals, like ""foil a villain's evil ""scheme"", ""destroy a magical threat inside a dungeon"", ""acquire a treasure"", ""rescue a captive"" these are cool dungeon goals. they have it broken down into wilderness goals as well, like ""establish trade with a distant town"", ""map a new land"", ""find a natural resource"", ""escape the ""reign of a tyrant"". and you have other cool ideas for goals. ""defending a location from attackers"", ""retrieving an object from a caravan"", ""infiltrate a fortified location"", ""successfully travel ""through an obstacle course to gain recognition or reward"". these are all very loose, very simple story hooks and goals that you can then weave a story around based on how you've built your town and you've built your npcs. so don't be afraid to go ahead and grab a copy of these, this can kinda be used as an example if you're feeling a little lost through their story. you can actually just roll randomly on these players and be like, ""all right, what are they doing today? oh well, ah, ""looks like they're infiltrating a fortified location. let me come up with some bullshit that, ""you know, justifies what they're doing."" so you can, technically, dm a game randomly by just rolling off these and improvising from that point forward. that's a little more of an advanced dungeon master technique if you really feel like just winging it from there. but that's a really cool resource to have at your disposal. another question, another thing i wanted to bring up with you guys was encounters. so when you do get into battle or when players encounter creatures or monsters or villain characters and they want to fight, you then go into an encounter, and you want to consider when you prepare for encounters, you think, where are they? are they fighting in a dungeon or are they fighting in forest or are they fighting in a swamp? are they fighting in an open plain? and you go through a book like the dungeon master's, or sorry the monster manual, and find creatures that you think would live in that type of topography. so if they're in an open field, you can think of more wild beasts or, you know, clans of roaming orcs. if they're in deep, deep mountains you can find creatures that burrow and naturally live in more earthy-based terrain, and you build encounters around that. there are some really great websites online that have encounter calculators where you can basically tell how difficult an encounter is based on how many players are in the party, what level they are, and you can build the encounter based on that. that way you don't end up accidentally making something that's too difficult or too easy for the party. and you don't want to make everything too hard. some battles can be fun and easy and really kind of have the players enjoy being badass and rushing into combat and just killing things really easily and being, 'ha-ha! i ruined everything! that's great! i am powerful!"" and you can have some battles that are pretty, ""phew, that was close. that was a good fight."" and then occasionally you want to throw them a curveball and have something they really have to struggle through, so when they finish that battle they really have to take a rest and realize, ""we almost lost one or more people in ""that fight,"" and that makes the stakes that much higher at that point, but you don't want to constantly be hitting them with super-hard battles. you don't want to be making things consistently too easy because it isn't a fun challenge for them. and consider terrain for combat, too. not every battle is just you versus monsters. sometimes there's a big cliff involved and the battle could be at a distance. sometimes there's pits of lava in the middle and that becomes a danger or a tool depending on how you look at it during the battle. sometimes, especially in urban combat, you have rooftops and alleyways in which you can use that to your advantage to avoid things, or push guys off a roof to fall and get hurt. or fall onto things, you know. there can be traps involved that you know are there that you can then push guys into. there's a really cool way of building encounters that are beyond just hitting things and doing damage. which is fine, too, don't get me wrong. also, if there's a monster in the monster manual that you like like, this is a really cool monster, but it's too easy, like the players are all level ten and this is a level three monster, you can customize the monster. you can make the monster more powerful. add more hit points. raise the stats a little more. give it a couple of unique attacks that you think would be fitting for it. if you don't like the fact that the bulette only has like a bite and stomp attack, maybe you decide that this bulette actually grew up or was raised around some sort of arcane, natural arcane relic that infused it with a resistance to magic and a capability that it has like electrical charges around it, and now when everyone, whenever anyone starts their turn next to it, they get shocked. it's an electric bulette! that's kinda cool. why not? you can customize and alter any aspect of any creature in the book. once again, all guidelines. you can go with the basis here, and it's a lot easier if you don't have a lot of time, but don't be afraid to customize and alter things to fit certain aspects of your world or your story as you see fit. it's great. i had the players in this campaign fight a proto-lich when they were level three or four. liches will wipe the floor with pretty much anything, but i considered it would be cool to introduce that powerful undead aspect if it was like just barely cresting out of its initial ritual to become a lich, in which case it was in a very weakened state. so if they had waited a day or two, that lich would have ruined them. it was still a tough battle, but they caught it when it was still essentially birthing, which made it a very, very weak lich. that's not in the books. i just took what was there and scaled it way back. that made for a really fun encounter. so, all guidelines. you can customize as you see fit, and there are great communities online of people that create creatures or beasts and have suggestions or feedback for anything you create. don't be afraid to reach out there. once again, i apologize, because this is a lot of information up front for trying to squeeze this in for you. also, maps! you see in critical role we do combat with maps that we draw up of terrain and we have everyone has individual models and the creatures have models. that is not necessary. i have found it's very helpful for our campaign because we have eight players, which makes it very difficult for everyone to keep in mind spatial awareness during the battle, who is who and what they're doing and how close monsters are. i grew up playing dungeons and dragons and other rpgs without maps or models at all. it was all theater of the mind, all in the brain, which is a lot of fun, but when you get a certain critical mass of players it becomes unwieldy, so the the models became necessary for us, but what we're doing tonight when we play our game, there's going to be no battlefield, no models. it's all going to be just keeping it in your head and me letting you know what's happening and where you guys are, so don't feel like it's absolutely necessary to do that. i just find it makes it easier when you have more players. and it's fun to draw maps. sometimes it's a lot of fun to do that. another question that has come up a lot. experience points. so, monsters that are killed or defeated in battle give you experience points. they don't necessarily have to be killed to get that experience points. if the players still win the encounter, meaning they forced them to surrender, or they managed to fight them to the point where they have to retreat. that is still a victory and the players should still get the experience for that encounter. you may give them a bonus if it's a big boss fight and they killed it and then get to reap the rewards of it. that's cool. that's totally up to you as a dm, but, you know, if they still successfully complete an encounter they still get the experience. if they flee from an encounter and the players technically lost the battle, you can still give them a little bit of experience to gain from that, but it would be largely docked by that, and that's totally up to you. that's combat experience. what about role-playing experience? that's arbitrary based on what you want to do as a dm. you can just write down, well that's cool, they get five hundred experience for that social encounter. you can make it up on the spot, and i recommend keeping an eye on what level the players are and what the experience values are for each level, so you know how much they need to get to the next level. that allows you to kind of build a structure. now for me, to keep track of roleplaying experience, it's an endeavor with eight players, so what i do is i have what i call a hatch marks system, where whenever anybody does something in the game that's a cool roleplaying experience or they save a circumstance i will give them a hatch mark next to their name. or multiple hatch marks if it was really, really clutch and really kind of changed the dynamic of the circumstance and saved their bacon. or if they failed miserably at something but they gave it a really, really good try and it was a cool idea, i might still give them a hatch mark or two, 'cause it was a good shot. and so at the end of each game i have a kind of an equation for myself where i multiply their level by 25, so right now they're all level ten, it would be 250 experience and that's i give them that many, i multiply it by the number of hatch marks they get. so if somebody gets three hatch marks in a game, right now, they would get an additional 750 experience points at the end of that session based on the roleplaying experience. so that way i don't have to think too much about the math in the game, i just go, ""that's cool."" hatch mark. ""that was ""really cool!"" hatch mark hatch mark hatch mark. and then at the end of each session i'll go ahead and multiply the level by 25 and then multiply that by how many hatch marks i've given them and that's their total roleplaying experience. that's worked well for me. it's not for everyone, but i think it's a good way to quickly add up those moments and make sure players don't feel like you're slowing it down to keep track of who's done cool shit. that's a really condensed overview of dungeon mastering. um.",0,0,0,1,"Kraghammer",1,7.96399999999994,3238,0.40657960823707,288,"MATT"

"329",12,5914.056,5917.298,"MATT","the dungeon master guide actually has a really good breakdown about, in the magical items section, about the cost and rarity of magical items. i'm just going to pull it up here real fast. there's common. common magical items cost between 50 to 100 gold pieces. and it says ""character level: first or higher"". uncommon, also first or higher, but around 100 to 500 gold pieces. rare magical items are from fifth level or higher, around 500 to 5,000 gold pieces. then very rare, and then legendary which get higher and higher from there. legendary being 50,000 gold pieces and more. and so that helps you kinda gauge how easy or hard it is for players to find something of that level, and each one of the magical items in the book tells you if it's rare, uncommon, any of those type of circumstances. however, it gives you a range, so you as the gm or dm, you decide based on how powerful the item is, how much it's worth if the players wanted to sell it or buy it, and generally you consider if players are selling magical items, they're selling lower than they would buy it from, like any sort of pawn shop-type thing, they might get a quarter of what it's worth at a store, but if they're really charismatic and they're really good with their persuasion rolls they might be able to get more money than that, or conversely lower the price of items they want to buy. so, you wanna make sure you don't want to give too out too many items throughout the campaign quickly because then the players either get too powerful, and then any items you give them down the road seem not as interesting or flippant. i like to run a campaign that has, you know, occasional upgrades, just a little slow trickle with bursts of good item use, that way when you, they do find something truly magical, it's a, ""aw, nice!"" as opposed to, ""oh, ""it's another boots, who wants the boots? that's i've already got like three, here, you have that."" you know. it becomes less interesting and less special to me, so i like to trickle them out and keeping tabs on what players have, what they're missing, and then eventually kind of incorporate aspects of what they can upgrade their characters with down the road. or they can create them for themselves. there are rules for creating magical items if they have an arcane practice to their class.",0,0,0,1,"Kraghammer",1,3.24200000000019,440,0.135718692165322,329,"MATT"
