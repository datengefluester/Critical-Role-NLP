We have an exciting
new product we want to share with you

3
00:00:04,277 --> 00:00:07,948
today on Gilmore's Glorious QVC.

4
00:00:07,948 --> 00:00:11,615
What you see here is a beautiful
major arcana tarot deck

00:00:11,615 --> 00:00:13,332
featuring some of the most prominent figures

6
00:00:13,332 --> 00:00:16,230
of "who's who" in picturesque Tal'Dorei,

7
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,495
painted by the brilliant Lady Ioana Muresan.

8
00:00:19,495 --> 00:00:21,509
Printed on the finest card stock parchment

00:00:21,509 --> 00:00:24,866

the mines of Kraghammer,

10
00:00:24,866 --> 00:00:29,964
this is truly a showstopper for any
high society soiree.

11
00:00:29,964 --> 00:00:34,549
You're not just telling their fortunes,
you're bedazzling their future.

12
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:38,653
Now today we're offering this beautiful purple
and gold deluxe edition as well as...

13
00:00:38,653 --> 00:00:40,521
...that-that's it, actually.

14
00:00:40,521 --> 00:00:44,157
I wouldn't offer anything other than
the finest edition in my store.

15
00:00:44,157 --> 00:00:45,712
The going market retail price of these cards

16
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:49,152
is four platinum, or forty gold pieces,
or four hundred silver pieces,

17
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:51,101
or four thousand copper pieces,

18
00:00:51,101 --> 00:00:55,841
but today, we are giving you the special
Gilmore's Glorious QVC value of--

19
00:00:55,841 --> 00:00:59,246
Sherri, no, we're still filming those.

20
00:00:59,246 --> 00:01:01,311
Please! You're getting them all smudgy.

21
00:01:02,501 --> 00:01:08,433
The special Gilmore's Glorious QVC value
of 24 gold pieces and 99 copper.

22
00:01:08,433 --> 00:01:11,900
That's right. Just two and a half platinum pieces!

23
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,967
But that offer only lasts until the disclosed
amount of seconds

24
00:01:13,967 --> 00:01:15,901
runs out on the timer in the corner.

25
00:01:15,901 --> 00:01:20,566
Scry now! Or come down and visit me,
Gilmore, at Glimore's Glorious Goods.
