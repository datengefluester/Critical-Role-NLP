00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:01,810
MATT: Hello everyone and welcome

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:03,670
to this evening's episode of Critical Role.

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:05,540
Before we kick things off

4
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,320
we're going to do the videos in just a moment to intro

5
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,320
as we're waiting for a member to arrive.

6
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,790
But before we get started tonight

7
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,720
we have a couple special giveaways

8
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,440
getting all the subscriber counts we can get.

9
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,730
First off if we hit 3500 subscribers tonight

10
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,800
we're going to be giving away a player's handbook

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,610
signed by the cast of Critical Role,

12
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,160
a dicebox, and

13
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,930
one of these fantastically reconstructed horns of Orcus

14
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,570
torn recently from forehead of the mad beholder K'varn.

15
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,830
We actually have two of these

16
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,320
available tonight as part of the giveaways.

17
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,080
The first one will be at 3500 the next one at 3550

18
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,890
with the same package:

19
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,430
The player's handbook signed by everybody

20
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:45,340
the dice box and one of these horn props

21
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,340
which were made for us by the incredible

22
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,210
KommissarProps.

23
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,030
This is Kai Norman.

24
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,220
Kai, want to come in and say hello to everyone?

25
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,170
KAI: Yeah!

26
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,050
MATT: Show off your good work here.

27
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,330
KAI: Thank you.
MATT: Show off your good work here.

28
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,400
KAI: Hey guys!

29
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:57,650
KAI: I guess I should show you

30
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,230
a little bit about how they're built.

31
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:00,420
They're resin.

32
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,850
They're cast resin so they've got a little bit of

33
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,120
rigid foam in the back so they've got this nice kind of

34
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,130
bone marrow look

35
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:10,340
and they're all hand painted by me

36
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,110
and hopefully you guys will --

37
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:13,870
MARISHA: He's super awesome.

38
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,020
MATT: It's a good start.

39
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,290
MARISHA: You should totally go follow him

40
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:18,700
at KommissarProps.

41
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,710
It's kind of hard so I printed this out for you guys.

42
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:24,940
Follow him on Instagram and on Facebook.

43
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,500
That's where you see the most about this guy.

44
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:32,370
And go check it out. It's good for the giveaway.

45
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,390
MATT: He's a talented guy.

46
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,320
He's providing these for us for the giveaway tonight

47
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,100
totally on his own

48
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,550
and he's also going to be helping us

49
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:38,690
with future possible prop stuff

50
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,000
for the game as it progresses.

51
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,800
MARISHA: You definitely want to go follow him.

52
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,140
I actually tweeted a picture from your Instagram account,

53
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,020
so for those of you who are following me,

54
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,750
there's a direct link to his Instagram account.

55
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,640
Or just search this on Facebook or Instagram.

56
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,300
MATT: Indeed.

57
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,140
MARISHA: Do it. Do it now.

58
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,220
MATT: So we have those at 3500 and 3550.

59
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,050
If we get to 3600 tonight,

60
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:03,230
you'll get the t-shirt signed, a dice box, a starter kit

61
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:06,670
and we'll stay after and play some more Just Dance.

62
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,270
(cheers)

63
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,890
MATT: Yeah! Great!

64
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,400
MATT: Also want to give a big shoutout to --

65
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,980
we might have a bunch of new folks from imgur today --

66
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,090
someone put up a really cool post about us on imgur

67
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:20,960
and a lot of people saw it,

68
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,020
so those who came through that, hello, welcome,

69
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,610
you're gonna sit in and watch a bunch of us silly folk

70
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,400
play Dungeons & Dragons,

71
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,330
so it should be fun hopefully. Welcome.

72
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,400
In the meantime we'll go ahead and roll the videos,

73
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,150
we'll get some history on some of the characters

74
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,270
and we'll be back here in a few minutes.

75
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,380
MARISHA: We'll be back. Go follow.

76
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,760
And then we'll pull winners.

77
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:50,370
TRAVIS: Right, Listen up! If you have ale,

78
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:54,300
then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw!

79
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:58,130
A goliath of towering height and size,

80
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:00,500
this barbarian has an appetite

81
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,220
for the two great loves in his life:

82
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,320
combat, women,

83
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,980
and ale!

84
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:07,950
(record scratch)

85
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:08,840
Wait.

86
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,460
Easily the brains of the group,

87
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,920
Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge

88
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,230
of shapes, colors, and shiny things!

89
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,700
...also ale.

90
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,890
In his early years, armed with his two handed great axe,

91
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:25,390
Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst

92
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,560
(brawling sounds)
Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst

93
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,230
the ranks of his family's wandering herd.
(brawling sounds)

94
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,480
the ranks of his family's wandering herd.

95
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,970
But after coming upon an unsuspecting

96
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,960
elderly gnome in the woods,

97
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,900
he objected to the killing such an innocent life.

98
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:44,010
A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this...

99
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:47,200
well, this terrified little thing.

100
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,370
And his disobedience cost him dearly.

101
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,320
(weapon crack)
Beaten bloody, and banished by the herd leader,

102
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,880
Beaten bloody, and banished by the herd leader,

103
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,500
his uncle Kevdak,

104
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,940
Grog was abandoned and left to die.

105
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:02,400
Exiled from his herd, it was then that

106
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,930
the relative of the very gnome he fought to save,

107
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,620
saved him.

108
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,330
It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike,

109
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:15,360
that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge.

110
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,910
And they have remained close friends ever since.

111
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,820
Most nights, Grog can be found challenging

112
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,770
entire taverns to wrestling matches! Ha!

113
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:28,770
...or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house,

114
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,050
where you pay for...

115
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:32,190
lady favors.

116
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,470
Also ale!

117
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,820
MARISHA: A first Impression of Keyleth would

118
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,340
leave you with little information

119
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,090
on the half-elven druid.

120
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,650
You might even think that her social awkwardness

121
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:45,090
due to her sheltered upbringing is kind of sweet.

122
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,120
(chuckle)

123
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,630
Of course, it would be unwise to underestimate her

124
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,750
based on first impressions.

125
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,190
(thunder crack)
based on first impressions.

126
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,720
Under that unintimidating petite frame

127
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,330
is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed,

128
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,080
whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of

129
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,970
champions pee their pants, literally!

130
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,120
(soft chuckle)

131
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,060
Born to the Air Tribe of the Ashari people,

132
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,060
Keyleth was raised with a deep love

133
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,620
of nature and the elemental magics.

134
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,080
It is her people’s inherent duty to protect

135
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,260
the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei

136
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:20,170
where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm.

137
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:22,860
Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack

138
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,970
for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities.

139
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,410
Well, if you consider kittens and

140
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:30,690
flying squirrels to be little beasts.

141
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:31,930
Which, I do.

142
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:32,750
(clears throat)

143
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,250
Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe,

144
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,760
her father, Kohren,

145
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,970
realized her true prodigious abilities

146
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:44,330
and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster.

147
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,610
Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped

148
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:50,210
and replaced with endless spell memorization,

149
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,920
teachings from ancient traditions,

150
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,460
and exceedingly high expectations.

151
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,700
Every druid leader to be must embark on

152
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,060
a journey to seek out the sister tribes

153
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,570
in order to introduce and establish respect

154
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:03,650
amongst the fellow headmasters.

155
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:07,580
They call this the Aramente, or Noble Odyssey.

156
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,540
When her father felt she was ready,

157
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,500
he set her on the path to truly discovering herself.

158
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,140
Not knowing when, or if she will ever return.

159
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,920
As she hiked down the mountain towards Stillben,

160
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,320
she meditated on the task ahead.

161
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,790
Part of the Aramente is proving yourself

162
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,750
a strong warrior, a valiant protector,

163
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,230
and a wise and compassionate leader.

164
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,760
With this knowledge,

165
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,320
one thought plays in repeat in her mind:

166
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,940
Is she even worthy?

167
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,230
TALIESIN: Percy was the third child of seven children,

168
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:44,000
born to a noble family who lived far to the north

169
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,430
in the ancient castle of Whitestone.

170
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,690
With so many siblings to share the burdens of

171
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:51,000
lordship, Percy turned his attention to the

172
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,400
sciences, engineering, and naturalism.

173
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,810
One day, a mysterious couple,

174
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,540
named Lord and Lady Briarwood, came to court.

175
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,540
During a feast held in their honour,

176
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,690
the Briarwoods violently took control of the castle,

177
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,640
killing or imprisoning everyone

178
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,540
who would stand in their way.

179
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,650
Percy awoke chained in the dungeon,

180
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:13,220
only to be freed by his younger sister.

181
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,760
Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods’ men.

182
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,150
As they ran, Percy’s sister took

183
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,900
several arrows to the chest and fell.

184
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,410
Percy kept running, eventually jumping into

185
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:27,900
a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom.

186
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,800
He did not remember waking up on a fishing boat.

187
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,840
He barely remembered the next two years,

188
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,810
as he slowly made his way as far south as possible.

189
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:39,420
Then one night, Percy had a dream.

190
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:42,120
A roaring cloud of smoke offered him

191
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,260
vengeance against those who destroyed his family.

192
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:49,220
When he awoke, Percy began to design his first gun.

193
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,580
(gun cocks and fires)

194
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,990
ASHLEY: Pike grew up in the outskirts of town,

195
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,350
near the Bramblewood.

196
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,970
Her ancestors were a family of deep gnomes

197
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,820
with quite an unfavorable reputation.

198
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:05,020
Thievery, destruction, and trickery left them

199
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,810
with the curse of the last name Trickfoot.

200
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:10,800
Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and redemption,

201
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,380
had other plans for Pike's great-great-grandfather, Wilhand,

202
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:18,010
who left his family at a young age after a dream.

203
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:21,300
A dream that changed the course of the Trickfoot family.

204
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,890
Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae

205
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:26,260
and pledged from then on that him and his family

206
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,450
would live a life of service and devotion.

207
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:33,320
As a child, Pike seemed to have an affinity to heal.

208
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,210
Whether it was animals, people, or even flowers,

209
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,120
she felt she had a purpose in making things whole

210
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,010
that had once been broken.

211
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,010
She studied and learned the ways to heal

212
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,570
though divine magic.

213
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:49,010
She lived a peaceful life, quiet and simple,

214
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:51,340
until one day, Wilhand was captured

215
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,800
and almost killed by a group of goliath barbarians.

216
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,530
One of the goliaths took a stand

217
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,450
against the murder of the innocent gnome

218
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:02,050
and he himself was beaten, bloodied, and left for dead,

219
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:04,300
abandoned by his herd.

220
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,640
Wilhand went to Pike for help.

221
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,950
She prayed and healed this barbarian as best she could,

222
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,460
bringing him back to life.

223
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,720
When he awoke, she discovered his name

224
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,870
was Grog Strongjaw.

225
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:20,370
After that, they were best of friends,

226
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,370
a rather unlikely pair.

227
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,790
Little did she know that in a few years' time

228
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,660
Grog would soon return the favor

229
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,400
and bring her back from the clutches of death.

230
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,600
(creature growl and snapping)

231
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,400
After being killed in battle,

232
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,850
Pike felt angry.

233
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,250
She wanted to be stronger

234
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,980
so that it would never happen again.

235
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,280
She spent four months at sea

236
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,800
training with the men and women

237
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,730
aboard a ship called the Broken Howl.

238
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,330
Gripping her holy symbol in one hand,

239
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,490
and her morningstar in the other,

240
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:54,730
this time, Pike is ready.

241
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,810
SAM: Oh, you haven’t heard of Scanlan Shorthalt?

242
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,690
Well, gird your loins, ladies,

243
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:02,620
because he has his eye on you.

244
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,100
A talented musician, master of disguise,

245
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,410
and dashingly handsome in his own mind,

246
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,900
Scanlan sings songs

247
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,970
almost as much as he sings his own praises.

248
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,580
Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used

249
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,850
his endless charm and soaring tenor voice

250
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:20,020
to croon for coin and support his single mother.

251
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,860
One day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter,

252
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,780
and joined Dr. Dranzel’s Spectacular Traveling Troupe

253
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,610
where he learned the ways of the world

254
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:32,320
and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire.

255
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,210
A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite

256
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,340
come to terms with the violent death of his mother

257
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,780
at the hands of a goblin invasion.

258
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:43,160
While his years on the road provided many, shall we say,

259
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,660
educational experiences with the opposite sex,

260
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,160
deep down Scanlan yearns for the one thing

261
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,530
he’s never known:

262
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:53,180
the true love of a fellow Gnome.

263
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,050
Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first,

264
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,010
performer second, and fighter distant third.

265
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,770
On the battlefield, he’ll support his allies,

266
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:05,780
but rarely draws blood unless it’s to protect

267
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,540
fellow gnome, Pike.

268
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,690
Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh,

269
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:12,560
a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye

270
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,970
that melts hearts and makes the females swoon.

271
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,660
ORION: Greetings and salutations.

272
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,750
I am Tiberius Stormwind.

273
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,920
I hail from a town called Ty'rex,

274
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,920
located in the heart of Draconia,

275
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,330
born from a politically respected family.

276
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:30,510
At the age of 15,

277
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,970
I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer’s Rite,

278
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,260
showing prodigy-like control of my magic.

279
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,970
The judges and the Draconian high council were amazed

280
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,560
at how powerful my spells were

281
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,330
for how long I had been training.

282
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:44,060
At 20 years old, I was the youngest appointed member

283
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,530
of the magic guild in Draconian history.

284
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,610
For the next few years, I almost went mad

285
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:51,070
from the malaise of being a guild member,

286
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,880
as it’s rather boring.

287
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,640
However, one day I happened upon a chamber,

288
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,410
unused for quite some time.

289
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:00,020
In the room were stacks of books and maps

290
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,540
of the surrounding cities and areas

291
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,860
around the known world.

292
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,200
For months, I would frequent the chamber

293
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,220
and learned of artifacts from legend.

294
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,900
After a long period of research,

295
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,500
I made a list of artifacts that caught my eye.

296
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,550
I brought these findings to the high council

297
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,360
and was told that all of the information

298
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,240
in the chamber I had stumbled upon

299
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,850
was either believed to be fiction, or unsolvable mysteries,

300
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,650
and hence were lost forever.

301
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:25,320
I found those answers to be unacceptable.

302
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,530
A year later I devised a ruse

303
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:29,100
and managed to convince the city council

304
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,280
to lend support in me leaving Draconia

305
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,180
on a mission of peace and diplomacy

306
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,570
for the surrounding kingdoms.

307
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:37,160
Going from town to town and making friends and allies,

308
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,970
in and for the name of Draconia.

309
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,890
Being a red dragonborn,

310
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:43,920
I had quite the task on my hands in that respect,

311
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,480
but it was exactly what I needed

312
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,400
so I could explore the world and find these artifacts,

313
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,060
as I felt the truth was out there.

314
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,400
Some may describe me as buffoonish,

315
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,770
but I say poppycock to all that.

316
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:58,170
I am much sharper than most give me credit for.

317
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,240
I just don’t pay attention to things sometimes.

318
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,910
I’ve also been known to be rather cunning, loyal,

319
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:08,220
happy-go-lucky, and well, dangerous.

320
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,380
I can’t help but show my true scales every now and then.

321
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,980
But overall, I think I’m quite friendly for a Dragonborn.

322
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:19,820
LIAM: Never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men,

323
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:23,800
Vax'ildan learned at a young age to skip past formality,

324
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,970
preferring instead to invite himself in your door.

325
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:29,310
Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia,

326
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:31,970
Vax was born by a chance encounter between

327
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:34,640
elven royalty and human peasantry.

328
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,410
Raised by their mother in their early years,

329
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,980
the twins were eventually sent off

330
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,710
to their father in the Elven capital of Singorn.

331
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:45,330
But their cool reception among the elves there never warmed,

332
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:47,880
and their time in the capital didn’t last.

333
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,430
The siblings stole away one autumn night

334
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,430
and set out on the open road.

335
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,740
After a few years of wandering,

336
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,570
they eventually decided to return to their mother,

337
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:00,080
and journeyed back to the lands of their youth.

338
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,290
But instead of finding their childhood home,

339
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,410
they returned to a pile of rubble.

340
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:09,130
Their mother was gone, their home burned to ash.

341
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:12,000
Pressing the townspeople for answers,

342
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,260
they learned of the day the dragon came.

343
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:17,090
(roaring)

344
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:21,290
With their ties all severed, Vax'ildan and his sister

345
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:24,990
set out to find their fortune together in Tal'Dorei.

346
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,190
An outsider since birth, Vax quickly learned

347
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:32,000
to solve life’s challenges in his own particular way,

348
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,820
often by sidestepping them entirely.

349
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:38,360
And when his knack for circumventing adversity isn’t enough,

350
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:40,160
(sword unsheathing and slashing)

351
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,860
the way of blades the elves schooled him in

352
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,980
more than makes up the difference.

353
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:47,890
LAURA: Like so many half-elves,

354
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:50,610
Vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering

355
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:54,680
the cool reception of a people who don’t fully accept her.

356
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,110
Born of a human mother and an elven father

357
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:01,520
who only later in life took an interest in their existence,

358
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,580
Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax'ildan

359
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,680
quickly realized the only people

360
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,680
they could truly rely on in this world

361
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,360
were each other.

362
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,030
It was at the age of 10 when the two were taken

363
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:16,860
from their mother, and brought to live in Singorn,

364
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,860
the isolated Elven city for which

365
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,940
their father was an ambassador.

366
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:25,310
He quietly took them in, but always kept an icy distance,

367
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:28,240
and after too many years of disdainful looks,

368
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,660
the pair decided to leave his indifference behind

369
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,400
and set out on their own.

370
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:37,920
Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets

371
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,200
and learning the ways of the thief,

372
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,650
while Vex kept to the woods.

373
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:45,180
She preferred the isolation.

374
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,080
Always the keen observer,

375
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:51,800
she learned to hunt and to track, to spy and to shoot.

376
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,460
And through a series of fateful events,

377
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:58,250
earned herself a companion in the form of a bear --

378
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,370
her own stolen Trinket --

379
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:03,970
to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely.

380
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:09,310
Also he is adorable and gives expert massages.

381
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,820
MATT: Welcome back guys!

382
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,540
We have some interesting aspects of playing tonight

383
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,640
Orion Acaba will be here shortly,

384
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,990
he's currently stuck in traffic.

385
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:27,330
Unfortunately we will not have a Sam Riegel tonight,

386
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:28,810
due to his schedule.

387
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:29,970
ASHLEY: Scanlan?!

388
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:30,480
MARISHA: No Scanlan.

389
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,030
MATT: Laura Bailey and Travis Willingham,

390
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:35,800
our loving Grog and Vex, are out of town in Florida

391
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:40,240
but are Skyping in via modern technology.

392
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,450
LAURA: Technology? What's it all about?

393
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,220
MARISHA: We can actually see you guys pretty good.
MATT: We're going to try and make this work.

394
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,640
MARISHA: It's pretty cool.

395
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,450
ZAC: We're getting audio set up right now.

396
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,090
MATT: So we're getting this figured out.

397
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,210
They'll stay in play as long as they can.

398
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:54,120
They are three hours ahead of us.

399
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,630
To be fair, we have friends across the coast

400
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:56,850
that get up at 4am to watch this

401
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,170
LAURA: That's true.

402
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,580
MATT: You should hang around long as you can.

403
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,170
(strange monkey noises)
MATT: You should hang around long as you can.

404
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:02,980
MATT: We can't hear you right now.
(strange monkey noises)

405
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,300
(more monkey noises)
MATT: It's even better.

406
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:07,170
MATT: So as they're figuring this out guys.

407
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:07,740
We'll let you know,

408
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,020
we've already hit our first milestone for subs.

409
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:13,970
MATT: So we have a winner. The winner of our first package,

410
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:16,140
which includes the player's handbook signed by everybody,

411
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,370
the dice, and one horn of Orcus

412
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:21,650
torn from the forehead of K'varn...

413
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:23,840
Is the esteemed RhymesWithOrange!

414
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,100
Congratulations RhymesWithOrange,

415
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,530
you are the first winner of the horn.

416
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:27,970
(everyone claps)

417
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:30,210
MATT: Well done.

418
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,070
So we'll get that sent out --

419
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,720
TALIESIN: Are you taking a selfie with the iPad?

420
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,520
MARISHA: (laughs)

421
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,860
TALIESIN: Sorry.

422
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,410
MATT: (sighs)

423
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,050
TALIESIN: Sorry.

424
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:37,900
MATT: It's alright. So --

425
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,130
MARISHA: Thank you again to our friend

426
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:43,970
Kai Norman at KommissarProps for making the horn,

427
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:46,060
go follow him. It's awesome.

428
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,170
KommisarProps on Instagram and Facebook

429
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,160
MATT: Our next giveaway is at 3550.

430
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,720
And we will give away the second and only other horn,

431
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,800
as well as the rest of that package.

432
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,720
And at 3600 we're going to do

433
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,930
t-shirt signed, dice box, starter kit

434
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:03,230
and we're going to be dancing for you afterwards.

435
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:04,840
Let's see if we can get that by tonight.

436
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,580
Also, want to give you guys a heads up,

437
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,460
we've wanted to get some confirmation

438
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,910
to you guys about the episode releases after the live show.

439
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,020
Because we have a lot of people who watch the show

440
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,870
who can't watch it live.

441
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:17,780
MATT: The episodes are available immediately

442
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:21,700
afterward on Twitch if you're a subscriber.

443
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,090
So the morning after the show, if you're a subscriber,

444
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,990
you get to watch the episodes immediately afterward.

445
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,580
Plus you're helping us keep this channel going.

446
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,760
All the subscription money goes toward

447
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,540
maintaining the channel,

448
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,210
all the people that work here throughout the week,

449
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,410
all the other amazing hosts and people

450
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,100
that actually run the programs here.

451
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,100
So you help make this channel function.

452
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:40,610
MARISHA: Only subscribers get access to the archives.

453
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:41,620
MATT: -- archives immediately.

454
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,190
However --

455
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,120
LAURA: (coughs)
However --

456
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,780
MATT: -- volume.

457
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,780
MATT: To finish this thought, for those who aren't subscribers,

458
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,780
episodes do go up now every Monday,

459
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,580
that's going to be the confirmed time period of release.

460
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,770
MATT: So you can look forward to episodes

461
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:56,770
up on the Geek & Sundry website every Monday.

462
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,410
That's the scenario.

463
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:05,480
MATT: So, given that case,

464
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,610
whenever Orion gets here he'll hop in,

465
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,840
in the meantime, let's go ahead and start this game up.

466
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,780
MATT: So.

467
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,560
ASHLEY: All right here we go.

468
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,050
MATT: So, for those of us who --

469
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:14,940
MATT: Just a little heads up here,

470
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,130
the party has just returned after a long arduous trek

471
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:20,100
through The Underdark,

472
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,020
beneath the Dwarven city of Kraghammer.

473
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,570
MATT: They were sent to retrieve a paladin named

474
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:28,360
Lady Kima of Vord, who was on a vision quest

475
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,930
to stop some dark evil that her deity Bahamut

476
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:33,320
told her was existing beneath this mountain range,

477
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,020
and needed to be squelched.

478
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:38,680
MATT: The party managed to salvage her from insidious torture,

479
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:43,520
and through her aid as well as a Mind Flayer

480
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,460
who had been outcast from the society

481
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,020
and the colony nearby.

482
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,020
MATT: They managed to convince to help them as well,

483
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,460
fought their way through the tunnels,

484
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,920
past the Duergar army, eventually to

485
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,670
the underground Mindflayer colony of Yogg Voril

486
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:59,840
where they found that this entity called K'varn.

487
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,200
This was then eventually revealed

488
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,810
to be a mad beholder, K'varn,

489
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:06,410
who had been pseudo possessed

490
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:09,370
and given additional power by the Horn of Orcus,

491
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:12,680
a great and evil artifact long forgotten,

492
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,810
which had been found by this entity.

493
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:15,640
So they managed to make their way

494
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,400
into the temple, kill K'varn,

495
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,060
tear the horn from it's forehead,

496
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,200
however found themselves swarmed immediately

497
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,150
by an entire colony of mind flayers

498
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,680
heading toward the top of this temple.

499
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,460
They managed to battle and battle,

500
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,160
nearly losing a few party members,

501
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,220
and through some ingenuity, escape through the top,

502
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,450
glide over the city of Yogg Voril

503
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:35,900
through this underground chasm to a distant embankment

504
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,400
along the beachside of this underground lake.

505
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,330
And teleport their way back to their base city of Emon.

506
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,210
So they've come back to Emon,

507
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:48,400
they've come to their keep, Greyskull Keep,

508
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,210
and they've had an evening of rest.

509
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:51,790
Upon waking the next morning,

510
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:53,790
they've managed to get some breakfast,

511
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,290
they've freed Lady Kima from her stone entrapment

512
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:57,100
as she was turned to stone

513
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,600
during the battle with the beholder,

514
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,990
and had a conversation based around

515
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:02,970
what should or could be done

516
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:06,640
about this Horn of Orcus evil artifact.

517
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:11,040
So here we will pick up again from that point.

518
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,880
So the rest of you guys have eaten your meal,

519
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,500
Kima hungrily doing so.

520
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,840
All of you guys both sore and exhausted

521
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,290
having barely seen sunlight for a little over a week

522
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:24,990
and being probably the first or second good meal

523
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:27,660
you've had since leaving Kraghammer proper.

524
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:31,260
You all finish your food, Grog hungrily so,

525
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,940
double the size of his normal intake of

526
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,730
delicious meats and starches.

527
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,760
Tiberius has not seemed to have woken up

528
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,820
or found his way down from his room as of yet.

529
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,780
However, you guys did recently receive

530
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,680
a rolled up piece of parchment.

531
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,340
A notification from the council of Tal’Dorei,

532
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,170
saying that you have been requested to

533
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:55,000
the council chambers at some point this afternoon,

534
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,960
around the mid-day sun, to discuss your return

535
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,920
and the situation and conditions about it.

536
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,140
And that was all it said.

537
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:08,270
LIAM: I can't remember is Lady Kima with us at this point?

538
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,240
Is she unstoned?

539
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:09,880
MATT: She's unstoned,

540
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,730
you've already had the conversation with her last week

541
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:14,920
talking about the horn, basically interrogating her.

542
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,610
LIAM: And we said that we had it somewhere safe,

543
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:20,910
but weren't we playing coy with that?

544
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:21,700
MATT: You were playing coy with it but you --

545
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,640
ASHLEY: I had gone downstairs to go get Grog.

546
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,200
MATT: Yes, Grog returned with it

547
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,570
and you guys had the conversation basically saying

548
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:28,210
‘Oh, it's safe, don't worry. It's fine’.

549
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,010
Grog at which currently has it in the bag of holding.

550
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,410
MARISHA: But we haven't told her

551
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:34,320
that it's in the bag of holding right?

552
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,560
MATT: No you just said you have it somewhere safe.

553
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,550
MARISHA: We just said we have it somewhere safe.

554
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:38,360
MATT: Correct.

555
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,230
MARISHA: Okay.

556
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:44,350
MATT: Turn them up a little bit.

557
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,630
TALIESIN: I am highly entertained.

558
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,200
LIAM: I think we're getting feedback.

559
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,060
MATT: Oh, I see.

560
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:50,180
MARISHA: Oh yeah, that's us.

561
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,590
LAURA: Right! That would be us.

562
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,460
MATT: Yes.

563
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,480
LAURA: Sorry about that.

564
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,330
ASHLEY: We'll figure this out guys.

565
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,380
MARISHA: That wasn't too bad.

566
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:00,980
MATT: This is the new attempt at technology

567
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:01,710
with our out-of-towners.

568
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:04,610
TALIESIN: It's amazing.

569
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:05,470
MARISHA: It's working pretty well.

570
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,180
TALIESIN: It is working pretty well.

571
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,720
MARISHA: I'm kind of impressed.

572
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,400
PERCY: Have we actually opened up the parchment

573
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,450
and read it yet?

574
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:13,560
MATT: Yes, you have received it and you've inspected it.

575
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,690
ASHLEY: It's Tiberius.

576
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:18,750
ORION: Hey everybody.

577
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,970
MARISHA: Yes.

578
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,440
LAURA: Hey boo.
TALIESIN: I don't know what's going to happen.

579
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,620
MATT: He's going to crawl under the table.

580
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,630
There you have it.

581
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,780
LIAM: Good morning sleepyhead.

582
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,500
ORION: Hi guys.

583
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,890
MATT: As a couple hours have passed --

584
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:32,190
KEYLETH: Good morning Tiberius.

585
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:34,190
ORION: Hi. Right.

586
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,510
TIBERIUS: Hello.

587
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,220
ORION: Am I here?

588
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,240
LIAM: Yes you've just come down the stairs.

589
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,170
MATT: You've just now come down

590
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:42,900
after many hours of breakfast have passed.

591
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,430
It's now pushing around 11:00

592
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:46,650
in the afternoon comparatively,

593
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:47,810
and Tiberius comes storming

594
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:50,090
into the main dining hall of your keep.

595
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,780
TIBERIUS: Morning everyone.

596
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,700
KEYLETH: What is that?

597
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,810
TIBERIUS: This is my own bag of holding.

598
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:00,880
ORION: And I walk over to Grog

599
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,660
and I open their bag of holding

600
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:08,010
and take out my wheel of mending and I put it in here.

601
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:11,960
VEX: You got your own bag of holding?!

602
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:16,000
TIBERIUS: That's what I needed the extra gold for before I left.

603
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,220
KEYLETH: Where did you go to get that?

604
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,570
ORION: We're face-timing?
KEYLETH: Where did you go to get that?

605
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:21,250
ORION: Hey! Hi Guys!

606
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,730
TALIESIN: Science.

607
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:25,010
LIAM: We are the coolest.

608
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:27,490
ORION: I was like that's, "That's Laura's voice,

609
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:28,740
where the hell is that coming from?"

610
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:29,800
ASHLEY: At least we think we're cool.

611
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,740
MARISHA: At least we think we're cool.

612
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,220
ORION: Travis is there too! Sorry!

613
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,220
TIBERIUS: I mean.. Yes.

614
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:39,220
VAX: So Tiberius we're just waiting for you to awake.

615
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,640
I think we should probably go

616
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,580
and see the emperor, like you do.

617
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:47,300
Talk about the little problem we have.

618
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:51,100
KEYLETH: Wait.  Where did you go and get a bag of holding

619
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,950
in the time of us sleeping and you waking up.

620
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:59,630
TIBERIUS: If you recall, I actually went to Draconia...

621
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:01,100
when we all woke up to begin with.

622
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,930
KEYLETH: You didn't tell us that.

623
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:04,600
TIBERIUS: Why would I have to tell you?

624
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,040
KEYLETH: I didn't say you didn't have to,

625
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,040
I'm just saying you acted like I should know

626
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,010
and I'm saying I had no idea.

627
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:10,980
ORION: I could have sworn I cast that

628
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:11,980
and said that last game.

629
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,820
MATT: No, you just stayed in your room and did it on your own.

630
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,400
ORION: Oh shit.

631
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,380
(all laugh)

632
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,610
MARISHA: Yeah. So right now you're crazy to me.

633
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:19,780
ORION: Right. Okay.

634
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,100
PERCY: I'm also a little disturbed that

635
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,470
it looks like that bag of holding is made of you.

636
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:24,900
KEYLETH: Yes it does look like it's made of drag --

637
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,700
that seems cruel.

638
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,650
TIBERIUS: Actually this is wyvern skin.

639
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:32,340
We use it in the air force of the Draconian army.

640
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:32,960
And when the --

641
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,320
ASHLEY: Air force?

642
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,450
TIBERIUS: Yes. Draconia has an army,

643
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:39,900
500 standing, 200 are airborne.

644
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,840
KEYLETH: But they have an air force?

645
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,400
TIBERIUS: Yes.

646
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:44,520
Keyleth: Do they fly-- nevermind.

647
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,040
PERCY: No, they just blow, they force air.

648
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,900
KEYLETH: (laughs)

649
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:51,380
TIBERIUS: We have trained and tamed wyverns

650
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:55,060
which we have utilized and they are part of our culture.

651
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,620
PERCY: I've never seen a skinned one.

652
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:01,730
TIBERIUS: Yes. And so I went to the local "shoppe"

653
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:06,320
and purchased a bag of holding because I realized

654
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,350
that I did not hold my own wheel of mending for a long time.

655
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,570
PERCY: That was frustrating you, wasn't it?

656
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:15,640
TIBERIUS: It was extremely frustrating.

657
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,460
Especially because it's my artifact.

658
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:20,820
TIBERIUS: Yes.

659
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:21,640
KEYLETH: Well that's good.

660
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,560
It's probably good to have a second one of those.

661
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,710
KEYLETH: And it comes with water, how handy.

662
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:27,820
TIBERIUS: It holds a lot of things!

663
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,180
KEYLETH: How fantastic.

664
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,010
PERCY: We should probably get off to see

665
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:31,690
what the emperor wants.

666
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:33,060
TIBERIUS: Before we do that --

667
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,200
ORION: Where's Scanlan now?

668
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:37,820
KEYLETH: Not here.

669
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,700
MATT: Scanlan is currently in the room eating breakfast

670
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,160
ORION: We're all eating breakfast still right?

671
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:41,900
MATT: Yeah.

672
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,460
ORION: Hi everybody.

673
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,970
LIAM: Not you, you've apparently been globe shopping.

674
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:53,310
TIBERIUS: Right. Scanlan?

675
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:57,010
I was thinking about our last encounter.

676
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:58,440
ORION: I'm going to

677
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,480
take off my ion stone that's kinda chilling.

678
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:04,670
TIBERIUS: This is a particular thing that you've seen

679
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:05,940
me use several times.

680
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,060
And I notice in the last

681
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,780
couple of battles you've actually literally

682
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,670
run out of spells to cast.

683
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:13,150
I propose a friendly trade.

684
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:15,200
The crown on your head allows you to do certain things

685
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,330
which you have not utilized the last several rounds

686
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,280
you've owned it.

687
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,210
It seems you've actually complained about

688
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:22,090
not having extra spells to cast.

689
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,130
VAX: Rounds of what?

690
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,080
TIBERIUS: --rounds of battle, Vax.

691
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:26,670
VAX: Oh.

692
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:27,640
ORION: I don't know.

693
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,170
(all laugh)

694
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,740
TIBERIUS: So I assume that you could probably actually

695
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,770
use this more.

696
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:39,800
I have a tool that allows me to do it to begin with

697
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,960
and it's come in rather handy as you've seen.

698
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,220
What say you, Scanlan?

699
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,340
MATT: Scanlan looks to you and thinks for a second and goes

700
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,820
SCANLAN: You know what.

701
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,010
I'm going to think on that.

702
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:52,210
MARISHA: (laughs)

703
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:54,380
SCANLAN: Wait untill I'm more

704
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:59,250
rested and solid and sound mind before I can make

705
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,450
any sort of arrangements or trades here.

706
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:04,650
It would be unfair, given our current state of --

707
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,620
(all laugh)

708
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,260
VAX: It's true Scanlan, you should probably wait

709
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,720
until you're feeling a little more present.

710
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,420
PIKE: Wonderful plan Scanlan.
SCANLAN: Agreed, agreed.

711
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,920
SCANLAN: A couple hours at the local brothel

712
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,010
and all should be fine.

713
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:18,380
MATT: He cracks his fingers, expectantly.

714
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,650
VAX: Welcome back, even though we didn't know you were gone.

715
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:23,370
I've eaten. The rest of us have eaten --

716
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:25,220
PIKE: Were you gone all night?

717
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,770
TIBERIUS: No, just for about an hour.

718
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:27,320
KEYLETH: Oh.

719
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,640
TIBERIUS: It was a good trip. I needed it.

720
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,860
PIKE: Just saying hello to family and that?

721
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:32,730
TIBERIUS: No I just literally went to a shop I knew in Draconia

722
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:33,970
and picked up the item.

723
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,180
I wasn't sure if they had any in Emon

724
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:37,740
and didn't really want to waste any time looking for one.

725
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:39,740
PIKE: Well...

726
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:42,490
VAX: Good on you, shall we go to meet the emperor?

727
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,700
PERCY: I've eaten, let's politic.

728
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,880
VAX: I think so.

729
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:49,940
MATT: All right.

730
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,300
TALIESIN: This is so --

731
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,300
MATT: Can you guys hear us fine?

732
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,040
LAURA: Yeah.

733
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:58,060
MATT: Just making sure.

734
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,970
LAURA: Too scared to talk is all.

735
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:01,530
MARISHA: Scared to talk?

736
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:02,990
LIAM: Chime in, please.

737
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:03,890
MATT: Feel free to chime in whenever.

738
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:04,760
LIAM: One of us, one of us.

739
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:08,600
GROG: Balls. Taint. Ale. Nipples.

740
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,850
MATT: That's our Grog.

741
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:12,180
ASHLEY: Hey, there's Grog.

742
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:14,200
MARISHA: Grog!

743
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:17,330
MATT: As our wonderful giant, now filled with

744
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:20,700
various forms of delicious food matter warm in his belly,

745
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:24,000
gives a string of various curse words in enjoyment,

746
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,710
and sits up from the table with a loud fart

747
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:28,670
and you guys make your way out of Greyskull Keep.

748
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,310
MATT: Towards the outer wall of Emon,

749
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,990
in towards the entrance to Abedar's Promenade,

750
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:34,990
making your way towards the Cloudtop District

751
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:37,760
where the palace itself resides. Is there any place --

752
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,120
LAURA: Is Lady Kima with us?

753
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,560
MATT: Lady Kima is with you, yes.

754
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,540
TALIESIN: Good.

755
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,440
MATT: Is there anything else you want to do

756
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,440
or are you guys making a beeline for the palace?

757
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,820
ORION: I would like to take another

758
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,390
500 gold from the treasury before we do that.

759
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:54,640
And I do.

760
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:56,030
MATT: Okay.

761
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:56,940
LAURA: Wait, what?

762
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:57,940
LIAM: From the treasury.

763
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:00,460
VAX: You have to ask the treasurer.

764
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,340
VEX: How much do you want?

765
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,320
TIBERIUS: Five hundred to replenish the

766
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,710
500 that I initially took.

767
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:11,210
I don’t know if I will have to spend it at all, and if I do,

768
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:14,020
I will completely share my plan with all of you.

769
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,260
But I would like to see how what we do plays out next.

770
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,630
VEX: Another 500?

771
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,010
TIBERIUS: Yes.

772
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:25,040
ORION: That's all I do. That's all I want to do.

773
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:26,570
MATT: Anything else?

774
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,890
VAX: Have we had contact with Allura? Since returning?

775
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:31,260
MATT: Nuh uh.

776
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:31,740
VAX: Not yet?

777
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:36,580
LIAM: I feel good about her being at this meeting.

778
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,000
PIKE: Someone just got really excited

779
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,410
when we mentioned the name Allura.

780
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:42,290
ORION: I cast prestidigitation on myself

781
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:44,530
and make robes are all super clean and nice.

782
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:45,400
MATT: Got you.

783
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,900
MATT: As you guys walk into the center of the Cloudtop District,

784
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,230
you can see that her ivory tower,

785
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,720
which once collapsed around you,

786
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,000
is now standing in it's previous location,

787
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,450
seemingly untouched and back to it's original esteemed visual.

788
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:01,140
PERCY: That is the question, do we stop in first

789
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,530
or do we go straight to --

790
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:06,260
VAX: Was there a time requested on there?

791
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,830
MATT: It said around the noon day sun.

792
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:11,760
It's probably about 30 minutes give or take.

793
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,650
VAX: Allura's really the only person I trust.

794
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,620
PERCY: Perhaps we should not walk into the palace

795
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:19,080
with this on us, so to speak.

796
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:21,960
VAX: We don't have anything on us.

797
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,420
PERCY: No, we don't, but if we did

798
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,910
we should probably deal with it.

799
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:26,210
PERCY: What.

800
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:26,700
VAX: Yes.

801
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,430
PERCY: No. Yes. (laughs)

802
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:32,650
VAX: Tibbsy. Let's go ring Allura's bell.

803
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,630
GROG: I'd like to ring her bell.

804
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:40,580
TALIESIN: It's like having the internet right there.

805
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:45,400
LIAM: So I just start walking off towards Allura's tower.

806
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,020
ORION: I'll follow Vax.

807
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,110
MATT: Okay. Everyone else go with them?

808
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:48,750
PERCY: Yeah.

809
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:49,930
ASHLEY: Yeah.

810
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:51,520
MATT: So you guys trek your way towards

811
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,930
the northern edge of the Cloudtop District.

812
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,420
You round about the series of

813
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:57,460
very nice, fine marbled houses, finely crafted stone.

814
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:00,430
This is the affluent area of Emon proper.

815
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:04,050
It's in the secondary city wall, which of course

816
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:06,210
the upper echelon of merchants

817
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,130
and those who have money are offered

818
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,710
the secondary form of defense

819
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,780
against the town being sieged at all.

820
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,100
MATT: You come around the corner on the fine kind of

821
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,530
yellowish cobblestone road, turn,

822
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:18,890
and you get to the point where you can see

823
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,570
to the left of you is the giant courtyard that

824
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:23,570
surrounds the outskirts of the palace proper.

825
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:24,670
With the giant steps that lead up

826
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,670
to the darkened purple marble

827
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:28,770
that the entire structure is made out of.

828
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:30,340
To your right, there's a few buildings

829
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:35,220
and the white ivory tower that Allura lives in.

830
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,120
You approach, the front door is closed.

831
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,660
It still remains that giant iron knocker on the front

832
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,810
that hangs loosely, like a giant wishbone

833
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:44,810
that you slam into the front of the wooden doorway.

834
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:45,440
MATT: Give it a couple hits?

835
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,140
(Vax nods)

836
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,970
MATT: You can hear it echo throughout the interior

837
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:51,950
of the tall standing tower.

838
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:54,810
A few moments pass,

839
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:56,580
you hear the movement of chain.

840
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,970
A creaking of metal and then a --

841
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:04,640
some sort of large shifting of a wood platform or plank.

842
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,910
The door then creaks open

843
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:09,950
and there standing, a little bleary eyed,

844
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:11,950
slept-in a bit, but in the process of getting ready,

845
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:14,020
you see before you Arcanist Allura.

846
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,540
Her long blonde hair is half braided.

847
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,610
She's in her darkened blue robes.

848
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:20,210
You're used to seeing her in and see --

849
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:22,170
She opens the door, the sunlight hitting her eye.

850
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:24,820
She protects her vision for a second

851
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:27,130
before they focus on the rest of the group and she goes,

852
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:30,650
ALLURA: "My lord, you've all arrived!

853
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:31,620
"You've all arrived!"

854
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,060
MATT: And she swings the door opens

855
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,280
and runs forward immediately to you,

856
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,460
the first person that's there and she gives you a big hug.

857
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:38,660
MATT: She holds back and gives you a look over.

858
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:41,680
MATT: Her eyes are opened.

859
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,980
You can see how honestly eager

860
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,650
and happy to see that everyone's here safe.

861
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:48,370
LIAM: I look over at Tiberius and just short of sheepishly shrug.

862
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:50,020
TIBERIUS: I'm used to it, it's fine.

863
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,810
MATT: She turns over to give Pike a big hug.

864
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:54,650
She makes her way around the rest of the group.

865
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:57,820
ALLURA: "You're all... I'm so glad to see you're all back.

866
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:00,330
"I've heard there was some difficulties

867
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:02,580
"happening in Kraghammer at the time you arrived."

868
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:05,200
MATT: She turns around and takes your hands, Keyleth,

869
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,700
into her own and gives you a nod and a small hug.

870
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,460
Goes to Percy and gives you a hug.

871
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:12,920
Goes to Tiberius and gives you a big warm hug.

872
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:17,560
MATT: She slowly pulls away.

873
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,750
She acquiesces to your longer hug...

874
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:22,850
And then... pushes away.

875
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:25,050
TIBERIUS: It is nice to see you again.

876
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,130
ALLURA: "The pleasure is mine."

877
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:26,940
VEX: (sings) Awkward.

878
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:27,860
Everyone: (laughs)

879
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,250
ALLURA: "The pleasure is mine, Tiberius."

880
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,220
MATT: And as she turns around,

881
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:32,450
she sees standing behind the rest of you, there's Kima.

882
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:36,170
There in her now freshly cleaned golden armor

883
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:37,530
that she polished over the evening so she doesn't

884
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:41,040
smell of Duergar sweat and blood anymore.

885
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,640
VAX: We've brought you a present.

886
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,780
MATT: There's this moment where they both look at each other quietly.

887
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,810
And then Allura steps forward and says,

888
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:52,910
ALLURA: "Kima. Welcome back."

889
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,250
MATT: And they both just run and give this

890
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,340
big embracing bear hug.

891
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:59,300
She lifts Kima up and there's a slow spin.

892
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:03,620
You can see this very very strong bond of friendship

893
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,700
before she eventually puts Kima down and

894
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,400
takes a little bit, she holds her hands for a second.

895
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,570
You can see a tear running down Allura's cheek.

896
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:11,630
ALLURA: "I was so worried about you."

897
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:14,300
MATT: And Kima sheepishly turns her eyes to the side and says,

898
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,450
KIMA: "Sorry for the all the trouble."

899
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,960
TIBERIUS: Story of my life.

900
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,320
(all laugh)

901
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,760
ORION: Seriously Matthew?! Come on!

902
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,480
MATT: What?!

903
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,660
(all laugh)

904
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,950
MATT: They're good friends.

905
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,150
LIAM: Friends! Friends!

906
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,280
MARISHA: (laughs)

907
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:34,960
ORION: Friends.

908
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:37,420
MATT: Your assumptions, dragonborn.

909
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,250
(all laugh)

910
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:41,150
LIAM: Don't mug yourself.

911
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:41,900
TALIESIN: That's great.

912
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,820
LIAM: Come correct. Don't mug yourself.

913
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:51,970
MATT: (laughs)

914
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,580
MATT: They take a moment to just nod at each other.

915
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:59,140
She reaches her hand out in front of Kima's head

916
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,470
and rustles her hair for a second and says,

917
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:02,670
ALLURA: "You had many of us worried sick

918
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,140
"you can't keep running off like that."

919
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:04,780
MATT: And Kima says,

920
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,580
KIMA: "I know, I know."

921
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,680
MATT: Then Allura turns to the rest of the group and says,

922
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,470
ALLURA: "Thank you all so, so very much.

923
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:13,180
"You've done the realm and myself

924
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,980
"a great service in bringing her back."

925
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,460
MATT: At which point, Kima says,

926
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,200
KIMA: "Bring me back?

927
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,960
"They helped me complete my quest!

928
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:23,150
"You've made some strong allies, Allie."

929
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:27,010
MATT: And Allura starts heading back into her tower and says,

930
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:28,110
KEYLETH: Allie?
MATT: And Allura starts heading back into her tower and says,

931
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:28,850
ALLURA: "Well? Come. Enter. I have tea ready.

932
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:29,820
VEX: I like it.
ALLURA: "Well? Come. Enter. I have tea ready.

933
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:32,800
ALLURA: "Well? Come. Enter. I have tea ready.

934
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,530
"You all look like you could use it to be honest."

935
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:35,080
PIKE: Yeah.

936
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:35,790
ALLURA: "Come. Please."

937
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:36,650
PERCY: Well, all right.

938
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:37,330
TIBERIUS: I love tea.

939
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:38,500
PERCY: We have a moment we can spend.

940
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,740
VAX: Long story.

941
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:44,110
MATT: So as you guys all walk into her tower, you remember it

942
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:47,330
untouched from your previous entry here.

943
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:48,810
It's a weird moment to step into a tower

944
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:51,890
that you were once in as it crumbled and folded on itself,

945
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:53,890
to see it as if nothing had ever happened.

946
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:55,440
TALIESIN: Is there a new rug?

947
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,130
MATT: There is not.

948
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:57,690
TALIESIN: Ah-hah!

949
00:38:57,690 --> 00:38:58,940
LAURA: Hmm..

950
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:00,990
MARISHA: We're not giving it back.

951
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:01,810
LAURA: We shouldn't tell her about the rug.

952
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:03,060
MARISHA: Don't tell her about the rug.

953
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:08,730
MATT: You guys step into the center of the room and she's

954
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:10,880
talking to herself for a moment, saying

955
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,040
ALLURA: "Things have been a bit crazy here, obviously.

956
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:17,300
"Now that the floodgates have opened as far as

957
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:20,130
"discussions with the council and people who have

958
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:23,410
"maintained a backlog for a while. It's been a bit busy.

959
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:25,570
"But, this is a wonderful moment to respite.

960
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:27,980
"I'm greatly enjoying the company to be honest.

961
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:29,440
"Come."

962
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,410
MATT: She guides you all to the center of the chamber.

963
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,540
Once again, there's that large stone platform in the center

964
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,010
that has a number of the

965
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:37,740
inert runes carved into the stonework.

966
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,050
As you all step onto it,

967
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:41,710
she taps her heel against the bottom of it for a second.

968
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:44,400
As she does, all the runes glow with a bright flash of blue

969
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,360
and a familiar sensation as that circular platform

970
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,180
begins to lift like an arcane elevator,

971
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,730
up the center of the tower,

972
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:52,320
going up one, two, three stories.

973
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,800
And as you're going up you're seeing

974
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,800
certain sections of

975
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,990
wooden library shelves set up at odd angles

976
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:03,760
along the top of the arcane tower itself.

977
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,700
You can see there are small stairways

978
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,810
that lead off into doorways that seem to almost

979
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:09,650
exit into the sky.

980
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,770
MATT: You've gotten into the idea that a lot of these

981
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:16,440
powerful mage-built towers, the

982
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:20,100
inner workings don't really match the outer exterior look.

983
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,890
And there are rooms that shouldn't exist

984
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:23,570
at certain points as you lift up.

985
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:26,560
LIAM: I'd like to make a perfunctory insight check

986
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,460
just to see if there's anything hinky.

987
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,780
ORION: I'd like to google perfunctory real quick.

988
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,900
MATT: You can do that. Go for it.

989
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:33,540
LIAM: Okay.

990
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,430
MATT: On Allura?

991
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:37,310
LIAM: Yeah, everything's probably fine.

992
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,110
That's an 18.

993
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:47,490
MATT: Best that you can gather, she looks

994
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:49,960
like she's a bit groggy, having slept in recently.

995
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,320
But she seems extremely excited you've all

996
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,680
returned and seems eager to catch up

997
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,330
as far as what has transpired since last you met her.

998
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,540
MATT: The platform continues before it reaches

999
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:03,380
the topmost floor of the tower before

1000
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,930
the slowing of the stone platform

1001
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:08,010
eventually comes to a halt with a slight jostling.

1002
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:09,500
The runes fade and you're all

1003
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,890
on the top floor of the tower once again.

1004
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:11,970
This is her main chamber.

1005
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:14,100
You can see across the way there is

1006
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,850
her large cush canopy bed in the far corner.

1007
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:18,410
There are a number of desks.

1008
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:21,860
There's a small arcane laboratory on the far side.

1009
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:23,530
Looks like it's in a bit of disarray,

1010
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:25,140
as she's probably in the middle of a project.

1011
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,880
MATT: You do hear, as soon as you arrive,

1012
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,660
it sounds like the whistle of a tea kettle in the distance.

1013
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:32,010
At which point, she says,

1014
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:33,410
ALLURA: "Ah! Allow me."

1015
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:34,440
MATT: And she begins to walk over.

1016
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,770
She lifts her hand and you see a small drift

1017
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:39,070
of arcane energy as her mage hand goes and lifts,

1018
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,880
takes the water off of it's burner,

1019
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:45,380
and begins to absent mindedly mage-hand various teacups

1020
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:48,220
out of a large cabinet above the little kitchenette area.

1021
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,660
ASHLEY: That's awesome.

1022
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:52,000
(all laugh)

1023
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:54,920
MATT: At which point, everyone's looking around,

1024
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,330
Kima, amongst the rest of you guys, says,

1025
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:00,300
KIMA: "It's been awhile since I've been here.

1026
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,520
"Everything's as grandiose

1027
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:05,260
"and unnecessarily dressed as it always is.

1028
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:07,020
"I'm glad you got rid of that old rug though."

1029
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:08,860
LAURA: (laughs)

1030
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:12,220
(scattered coughing)

1031
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:12,990
VAX: Sorry.

1032
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:14,280
LIAM: (coughs)

1033
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,600
PIKE: Was there a rug?

1034
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,240
VAX: I'm fine.

1035
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,290
PERCY: I don't remember that.

1036
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:18,670
KEYLETH: Stay cool. Come on.

1037
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:19,340
GROG: This rug?

1038
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:19,770
VEX: Nope.

1039
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:20,330
PERCY: Nope.

1040
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:20,810
PIKE: Nope.

1041
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:22,370
PERCY: Not here.

1042
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:24,830
MATT: Allura, who is now in the process of pulling chairs over

1043
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:26,460
and setting up a small sitting arrangement,

1044
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,560
a semi-circle, and says,

1045
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,890
KEYLETH: It’s so cute.

1046
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:31,620
ALLURA: "The last time the tower collapsed

1047
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:36,290
"and I was so rudely assaulted in my living quarters,

1048
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:39,390
"it appears my rug went missing. It's all right.

1049
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,390
"I've kept my eye out for a new one for some time."

1050
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,260
TIBERIUS: That was unfortunate.

1051
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:46,570
VAX: Magic, it's tricky.

1052
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:49,470
TIBERIUS: I had no idea. I jumped out when that happened.

1053
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:51,550
PERCY: Speaking of tricky magic.

1054
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:55,620
MATT: She gives a slow, knowing look about the group.

1055
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:59,630
And gives a nod like, 'I acquiesce to this, that's fine'.

1056
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:04,180
KEYLETH: You should have some potted plants, Allura.

1057
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,200
Like some nice greenery.

1058
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,200
PERCY: You're going to try and feng shui the tower,

1059
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:10,680
is that what you--

1060
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:11,800
KEYLETH: Well, why not.

1061
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,130
PERCY: I don't know.

1062
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,930
ALLURA: "That's not a bad idea. Perhaps we'll discuss this."

1063
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:17,840
VAX: This is silly.

1064
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:21,280
VAX: Allura, it's a long story. Lot of deurgar,

1065
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:25,860
lot of mindflayer, lot of mindflayers, and an evil god?

1066
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:26,760
PERCY: A beholder.

1067
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,760
TIBERIUS: Yes, moreover, a beholder.

1068
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:31,930
VAX: Yes, but who was pulling the strings behind the beholder.

1069
00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:33,930
KEYLETH: He thought he was an evil god.

1070
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:35,930
A beholder with a god complex?

1071
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:37,870
ALLURA: "Curious."

1072
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:39,090
MATT: At which point, as you say that,

1073
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:40,280
she does this with her fingers,

1074
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,140
and all the chairs rush in underneath you guys.

1075
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:45,140
And you're put into a sitting position.

1076
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:47,720
As you all sit, she begins to slowly mage-hand over

1077
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,020
each one of you a freshly poured cup of tea.

1078
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:53,210
MATT: A look of concern comes across her face.

1079
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:57,860
ALLURA: "So you found your way beneath the city,

1080
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:01,560
"I assume based on the denizens you've mentioned,

1081
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,370
"into the underdark proper.

1082
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:05,940
"A beholder you say?

1083
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,040
"Mindflayers you say?"

1084
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:07,610
PERCY: Yes.

1085
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:10,810
ALLURA: "I first off must apologize, I was not aware

1086
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:12,830
"I was putting you into such dangerous territory."

1087
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:14,590
TIBERIUS: Ha!

1088
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:16,010
It was really dangerous!

1089
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:19,070
It was nothing, filled with just buttholes everywhere.

1090
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:19,940
Terrible.

1091
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:21,580
ALLURA: "That sounds like a terrible city."

1092
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:22,430
TIBERIUS: Mhm..

1093
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:23,980
MARISHA: (laughs)

1094
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:27,440
ALLURA: "Well, first and foremost, I apologize for that.

1095
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,340
"I am incredibly grateful you're all

1096
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:32,190
"seemingly healthy and still here.

1097
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:35,080
"And you've brought Kima back to us which is very important."

1098
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,000
ALLURA: "Well, I guess this is in order."

1099
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,390
MATT: And she sits up for a second and walks over.

1100
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:44,090
And you can see she looks back at the rest of you and

1101
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:46,650
brushes her hand for a second.

1102
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:48,730
A sphere of darkness appears in the corner of the room

1103
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:50,890
where you can not see an entire part of the room.

1104
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:52,650
And she sits there and hovers.

1105
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:54,450
Just a little pocket of darkness.

1106
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:55,320
MARISHA: Aw, man.

1107
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,340
PIKE: What's that?

1108
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:56,980
MATT: You hear some rustling.

1109
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:58,660
KEYLETH: We've been in darkness so long.
MATT: You hear some rustling.

1110
00:44:58,660 --> 00:44:59,930
MATT: You hear some rustling.

1111
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:01,240
MATT: The sphere of darkness finishes

1112
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,180
and you see she's holding a sack of coins,

1113
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:04,890
that you don't know where she picked them up from.

1114
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:05,630
KEYLETH: Oh!

1115
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:08,080
MATT: She steps back over to her chair, sits down, and says,

1116
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:09,790
ALLURA: "Just a precaution,

1117
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,930
"I like to keep my private things private.

1118
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:15,790
"But, a deal is a deal and you've done as you've asked.

1119
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:19,520
"So as we've discussed, 10,000 gold pieces,

1120
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,120
"to the lot of you, and my greatest thanks."

1121
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,450
LAURA: I take that.
"to the lot of you, and my greatest thanks."

1122
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:24,540
(all laugh)

1123
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:27,180
MATT: She hands it out to Vex's eager palm.

1124
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:28,350
It's very heavy.

1125
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,340
LAURA: Good thing I'm strong then, huh?

1126
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:35,970
MATT: With her 9 strength, it sags.

1127
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:38,110
LAURA: Sorry about the hand gesture there, stop it.

1128
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,600
(all laugh)

1129
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,690
MATT: Internet.

1130
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:43,570
MATT: She sits back down, says,

1131
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,440
ALLURA: "You tell me what else if anything has transpired,

1132
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,440
"and I'll let you know what you've missed."

1133
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,590
PIKE: Well.

1134
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:59,020
TIBERIUS: We have Orcus's horn. So that's a thing.

1135
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:06,420
MATT: There's a slight pause before the actual sound of

1136
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:07,810
breaking glass hits your ears

1137
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:09,970
as the teacup that she's holding

1138
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:12,270
shatters across the stonework on the floor.

1139
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:16,460
MATT: Allura, still sitting in her chair,

1140
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:17,740
hands in place and says

1141
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:20,500
ALLURA: "I'm sorry, what did you say?"

1142
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:23,000
TIBERIUS: Yes, that beholder butthole that we had to fight,

1143
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,160
that we had no idea we had to fight,

1144
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,880
had this Orcus horn on his head.

1145
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:28,350
So we took it off and we kept it safe.

1146
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:30,400
That's what you wanted I'm assuming, to destroy it.

1147
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,900
VEX: But we haven't touched it though.

1148
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:33,240
TIBERIUS: No.

1149
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:35,180
ALLURA: "All right."

1150
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:36,360
MATT: She looks over to Kima,

1151
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,860
who does this with her shoulders up.

1152
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:39,780
Kima gives her a nod and says,

1153
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:41,800
KIMA: "To be honest,

1154
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,730
"I wasn't sure that was the end of my journey.

1155
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:46,880
"But it seems that great evil I talked about before,

1156
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,380
"we killed it and took its source of power.

1157
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:51,780
"Now we're figuring out what to do with it."

1158
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:54,510
MATT: She gives a sheepish grin and a slight shrug in her armor.

1159
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:57,860
Allura looks to the ground for a moment and says,

1160
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:02,170
ALLURA: "I don't know much of this object you say,

1161
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:05,810
"but if it was the source of the creature's power,

1162
00:47:05,810 --> 00:47:08,180
"and it carries with it the connotations of Orcus,

1163
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:11,710
"then this is a very, very ill omen indeed."

1164
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:13,230
TIBERIUS: Yes.

1165
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:16,500
ALLURA: "This must be brought before the council immediately."

1166
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:16,960
TIBERIUS: Wait.

1167
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,560
KEYLETH: The council?

1168
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,500
TIBERIUS: The council?

1169
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,840
ALLURA: "The council of Tal'Dorei, the council you are part of."

1170
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:23,480
TIBERIUS: That helps.

1171
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,540
PIKE: Are you going there, right now, also?

1172
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:27,050
ALLURA: "Yes, I was summoned to it."

1173
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,400
PIKE: We were as well.
TIBERIUS: Here's the thing.

1174
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:30,900
TIBERIUS: Sorry, Pike.

1175
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,780
The thing with this particular item is,

1176
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:35,610
the more people know about it,

1177
00:47:35,610 --> 00:47:37,610
the more dangerous it actually becomes.

1178
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:39,780
The fact that we even share this information with Kima

1179
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:42,400
and with you is a very dangerous thing to begin with.

1180
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,140
ALLURA: "I agree."

1181
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:46,330
TIBERIUS: Are the council trustworthy?

1182
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:49,000
ALLURA: "Those who currently reside on the council are trustworthy,

1183
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:49,900
"I assure you this.

1184
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:52,650
"I've done my work with them for many years,

1185
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:54,210
"and those that have passed have been replaced

1186
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:56,030
"with equally trustworthy individuals.

1187
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:57,630
"And, rest assured,

1188
00:47:57,630 --> 00:48:00,000
"I have my checks and balances in place as well."

1189
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:03,100
VAX: I think what we're worried about most is

1190
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:06,370
the corrupting nature of this thing.

1191
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:10,990
And while the council may have good intentions,

1192
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:13,890
I think more than a few of us are somewhat nervous.

1193
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:18,340
What effect it might have on them, on us.

1194
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:20,560
ALLURA: "Can you assess what the mistrust would be

1195
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:23,410
"to not bring this before the sovereign and the council?"

1196
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:27,850
TIBERIUS: Namely, if the immediate want is

1197
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:30,480
for it to be immediately destroyed,

1198
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,250
because that's what needs to happen with

1199
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:34,720
anything from Orcus, as you very well know.

1200
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:35,480
ALLURA: "I understand,

1201
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,330
"and I don't think you'll find anyone who disagrees.

1202
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:40,120
"But I also don't think you should sow mistrust with the council

1203
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,760
"by keeping any of this information from them."

1204
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,950
KEYLETH: It's not about trust.

1205
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:46,980
VEX: Uriel has been corrupted once already.

1206
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:47,630
KEYLETH: Exactly.

1207
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:49,450
ALLURA: "This is true, and was it not by your hand

1208
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:51,290
"that he was freed and his family kept safe?

1209
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:53,480
"Understand, that this is a man that

1210
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,070
"owes you him and his family's life.

1211
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:57,070
"I think he would take in to you,

1212
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:59,660
"his ear bent in your direction quite strongly."

1213
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:01,880
KEYLETH: Correct, but couldn't you also safely say

1214
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:05,090
that he is therefore fairly easy corruptible?

1215
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:08,860
If he had been corrupted before, even not if subconsciously,

1216
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:11,530
I'm not saying intentionally, but he clearly...

1217
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:12,810
ALLURA: "You would know best

1218
00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:14,650
"what was responsible for corrupting our sovereign,

1219
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:17,490
"as you did fight and one was felled,

1220
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:18,880
"by it's own strength."

1221
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:23,210
KEYLETH: I'm saying Lady Allura, that there is

1222
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:27,220
essences, there seems to be magical properties to this horn

1223
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:31,480
that corrupt even some of the strongest willed individuals.

1224
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:33,800
ALLURA: "Then we must be rid of it quickly.

1225
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,580
"And I think we need to at least discuss this

1226
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:43,400
"with the council, if not present it.

1227
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:46,430
"Bring it to their attention.

1228
00:49:46,430 --> 00:49:49,770
"There are ways, arcane...

1229
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:55,410
"not very approved ways,

1230
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:58,330
"of nullifying targeted memories."

1231
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:01,900
"The rest of the arcana pentsafocal have banned

1232
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:04,750
"the use of such magics but if we could have approval,

1233
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:08,430
"understanding the safety concerns of this object

1234
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:12,610
"from the council we could override the arcana pentsafocal

1235
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:15,140
"and I could employ some of these magics to make sure that

1236
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:17,210
"once this artifact is destroyed

1237
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:19,440
"or taken somewhere to never be found again,

1238
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,540
"we ourselves perhaps would not recall it ever existed.

1239
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:25,520
"And that itself is the safest course of action."

1240
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:28,240
TIBERIUS: I agree.

1241
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:31,790
VAX: I think that we trust you.

1242
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:34,920
And you trust the council. That's enough for me.

1243
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:36,160
PERCY: That's enough for me as well.

1244
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,120
KEYLETH: Pike? Where do you stand.

1245
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,050
TIBERIUS: That's definitely enough for me.
KEYLETH: Pike? Where do you stand.

1246
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:40,590
TIBERIUS: Just so you know Allura --

1247
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:42,860
TIBERIUS: I might have

1248
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:45,170
a solution as well for actually destroying it,

1249
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:47,170
so I will follow your lead.

1250
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:49,680
PERCY: I think the best course of action is to trust people.

1251
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:53,150
VAX: And we're incapable of destroying the thing on our own.

1252
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:55,150
TIBERIUS: Oh, that's not true at all.

1253
00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:57,690
I might have a solution which I just shared with Allura.

1254
00:50:57,690 --> 00:50:59,690
I'm letting her take the lead on this,

1255
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:01,890
and when the situation presents itself

1256
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:04,140
I might have a solution to destroy it outright.

1257
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,810
VEX: Why don't you share that with us now Tiberius,

1258
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:06,940
instead of keeping it secret?

1259
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:08,810
VAX: Just give us a rough sketch, maybe?
instead of keeping it secret?

1260
00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:10,220
TIBERIUS: Very well.

1261
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:12,000
ORION: I'll pull out my bag of holding.

1262
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:13,720
TIBERIUS: This.

1263
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,140
KEYLETH: The mending wheel?

1264
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:17,850
TIBERIUS: No, the bag.

1265
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:20,110
LAURA: An empty fist?

1266
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:21,280
LIAM: He pulled out the bag.

1267
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:25,600
KEYLETH: Okay. Would you care to elaborate, Tiberius?

1268
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,050
TIBERIUS: I'm sorry.

1269
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:30,880
This part of the thing I wanted to tell all of you at breakfast.

1270
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:36,800
The idea is, with some research

1271
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,840
I've come to find that if anything is in a bag of holding,

1272
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,840
and the bag of holding itself is destroyed,

1273
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:45,370
the items or whatever go into a somewhat void,

1274
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:48,370
that cannot be retrieved by any one particular thing.

1275
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:51,650
If we are to have our memories erased, as you say,

1276
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:55,000
then it would guarantee that when we place the

1277
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,460
thing in a bag of holding and destroy that bag,

1278
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:59,980
it will then be dissipated into that void.

1279
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:03,260
MATT: At which point, Allura raises her hand and says,

1280
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:06,940
ALLURA: "Tiberius. You, as a very trained sorcerer,

1281
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:09,230
"have some knowledge in this regard.

1282
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:12,300
"I've been crafting bags of holding since I was a child

1283
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:14,350
"as a way of keeping my weekends busy.

1284
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:18,060
"I have to notify you that should such a pocket of

1285
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:21,080
"interdimensional arcane space is disrupted in this way,

1286
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,560
"it doesn't send it into a void.

1287
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:25,260
"It jettisons the contents into the Astral Sea.

1288
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:28,650
"The Astral Sea which has many denizens

1289
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:30,290
"that could come across this object.

1290
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:32,660
"Githyanki themselves and their great ships."

1291
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:33,940
TIBERIUS: I hate yankees.

1292
00:52:35,010 --> 00:52:36,460
ALLURA: "Gith --nevermind."

1293
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:37,900
PIKE: So it could be bad.

1294
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:38,750
TIBERIUS: There are things --

1295
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,930
ALLURA: "There are many things that exist in the Astral Sea

1296
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:43,180
"that could recover this item.

1297
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,850
"I'm not saying there isn't merit to this, but I think

1298
00:52:46,850 --> 00:52:48,560
"it would be best we put it somewhere

1299
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:51,660
"where at least we know for certain no one will find it,

1300
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:54,340
"as opposed to just hoping it disappears somewhere."

1301
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:56,020
TIBERIUS: But the memory thing is crucial.

1302
00:52:57,150 --> 00:53:00,920
KEYLETH: What about those who might be uncomfortable with

1303
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,690
toying around with my memories

1304
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:05,730
and tramping along around in my head,

1305
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:07,880
I don't really want --

1306
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,720
VAX: Why don't you think about it for a while?

1307
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,560
GROG: My head's pretty fragile as it is.

1308
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:17,060
VAX: We're talking about erasing the path back to this thing,

1309
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:18,850
we're not talking about removing your

1310
00:53:18,850 --> 00:53:22,510
adolescent years from your memory. Just this one thing.

1311
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:24,510
GROG: All right.

1312
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:28,010
KEYLETH: How many lessons have we learned in just the time.

1313
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:31,530
Wouldn't we have to erase all memories surrounding it?

1314
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:33,710
We wouldn't even remember our trip into the underdark?

1315
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,740
PERCY: I think we could perhaps just erase

1316
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:37,230
the memory of where we put it.

1317
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:40,410
TIBERIUS: That is what I assume will happen.

1318
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:42,410
ALLURA: "That is possible.

1319
00:53:42,410 --> 00:53:44,410
"Like I've said, these magics have not been tampered with

1320
00:53:44,410 --> 00:53:45,720
"in nearly 200 years."

1321
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:48,900
KEYLETH: So we're gonna break the seal on some

1322
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:51,640
untampered-with magics and just experiment.

1323
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:57,680
ALLURA: "I am part of a group that oversees civilization.

1324
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,450
"I can't go into too much detail

1325
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:02,940
"but they are responsible for keeping such ancient magics,

1326
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:04,820
"long forgotten magics such as this.

1327
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:06,860
"I would have to

1328
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:09,570
"meet with and discuss and gain approval for its use.

1329
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:13,280
"But for an item as dangerous as what you say,

1330
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,610
"perhaps this is one of those special occasions."

1331
00:54:15,610 --> 00:54:18,090
LIAM: She's working for the Illuminati and we're basically

1332
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:20,970
the A-team, so I think she might know a little better.

1333
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:21,940
TALIESIN: The A-team?

1334
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:26,880
KEYLETH: What do you think, Pike?

1335
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:31,060
PIKE: I feel like at this point

1336
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:33,020
we don't really have another option.

1337
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:36,260
PIKE: And I do trust Allura.

1338
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:37,400
TIBERIUS: I'm all tapped out.
PIKE: And I do trust Allura.

1339
00:54:38,450 --> 00:54:42,060
PIKE: So I feel like if we just

1340
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:43,200
go check it out.

1341
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:47,600
I don't really know what our other option is.

1342
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:50,040
PIKE: That was a good one.

1343
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,500
VAX: And if we don't like it we can step.

1344
00:54:54,050 --> 00:54:54,840
PERCY: And if we don't like it

1345
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:57,100
we can keep thinking of something else.

1346
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:58,280
We have time.

1347
00:54:59,010 --> 00:55:01,210
ALLURA: "This is true. And who knows what wisdom

1348
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:03,540
"the rest of the council might have in their midst as well.

1349
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,440
ALLURA: "They have members from all across the world.

1350
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,860
"We'll see which resources they have at their disposal."

1351
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:12,370
PERCY: I'm sure they're waiting for us.

1352
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:15,790
ALLURA: "I am glad to be free of my usual business.

1353
00:55:15,790 --> 00:55:17,660
"Are you guys familiar with the Wilder Fens?"

1354
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:19,620
VAX: Sorry? The Wilder Fens?

1355
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:20,690
ALLURA: "The Wilder Fens?

1356

"They're a bloody merchant guild.

"Look, since you've been gone and the council map

1359

"council meetings that have been

1362
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,540
"pushed back and pushed back for months and months.

"It's been rather nightmarish.

"and they just tore through Emon with a caravan of

1371

"partying gypsies that destroyed everything in their path."

1372
00:55:59,470 --> 00:56:00,510
KEYLETH: Who?

1373
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:01,290
TIBERIUS: Damn gypsies.

1374
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:03,960
ALLURA: "The Cortian League."

1375
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:07,390
MARISHA: The Cortian League.

1376
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:10,090
ALLURA: "From Wildmount, the north."

1377
00:56:10,090 --> 00:56:13,610
PERCY: We fought stitch monsters, that was mostly what we...

1378
00:56:13,610 --> 00:56:17,370
it was guns and swords and...

1379
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:19,070
ALLURA: "It's far more interesting.

1380
00:56:19,070 --> 00:56:21,530
"Most of our guests have been a bit rough around the edges.

1381
00:56:21,530 --> 00:56:23,170
"Although I would say

1382
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:25,380

"We have some business there getting Syngorn situated."

1384
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:30,160
VEX: Oh, Syldor!
ALLURA: "And Lord and Lady Briarwood

1385
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,160
"were rather nice to us when they came into the town.

1386
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:37,310
"So, business has been... fair."

1387
00:56:39,810 --> 00:56:41,380
PERCY: Shall we take this to the council then?

1388
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:42,650
VAX: Yes, we have pressing matters.

1389
00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:45,060
We'll get to that later.

1390
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:47,730
ALLURA: "All right. Let's go to the council then."

1391
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:54,330
MATT: As you guys make your way back down through the tower,

1392
00:56:54,330 --> 00:56:56,050
you eventually venture through

1393
00:56:56,050 --> 00:56:58,200
the castletop district in front of the palace.

1394
00:56:58,530 --> 00:57:00,300
The guards stand there with their

1395
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:03,730
long, red, velvet cloaks and their brass breastplates.

1396
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:06,130
They recognize both Allura and you as you approach.

1397
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:10,080
They step aside, put their spears toward the steps,

1398
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:13,070
and give you a grand entrance to the front of the palace.

1399
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:16,560
MATT: As you step up, the front doors open on their own

1400
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:19,180
with a large heavy shaking of the wood.

1401
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:21,000
As the palace doors open,

1402
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
you are led into the central chambers

1403
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:26,740
of the main palace walkway which splits to the right and left,

1404
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:29,470
and then across leads into the main throne room.

1405
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:31,000
However, you guys are meeting in the council room

1406
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,790
which is to the left. You've been there twice before.

1407
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,350
MATT: So you're led over to the council chambers,

1408
00:57:36,350 --> 00:57:38,670
which, as you enter the main circular room,

1409
00:57:38,670 --> 00:57:42,670
you're brought into the nice hardwood floors,

1410
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:46,000
the dark forest green colored walls,

1411
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,780
these long tapestries which recall various battles

1412
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:53,300
of history and broad mountainous landscapes

1413
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:57,700
showing settlers making their way across dangerous terrain.

1414
00:57:58,350 --> 00:58:01,340
You can see various weapons from different civilizations

1415
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:03,340
that were brought up as gifts to Emon

1416
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:04,640
that have been mounted on the walls

1417
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:08,010
as presentory atmospheric decor.

1418
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:15,380
And in the central room, you can see what currently stands,

1419
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:19,690
the entirety of the Tal'Dorei council, in a hushed discussion.

1420
00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:23,310
The council, of course, has at the center,

1421
00:58:23,310 --> 00:58:24,460
across the table from you,

1422
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:26,840
Sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei the Second himself.

1423
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:29,060
The leader of Emon and the current Sovereign

1424
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:32,240
of all of Tal'Dorei, this section of the continent.

1425
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:36,400
You see him with his characteristic dark hair,

1426
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:40,320
with greying sides, cut shorter than you recall.

1427
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,760
Looks like he recently got a trim

1428
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,700
and some very well kept facial hair.

1429
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:46,700
He's wearing his ceremonial robes which are

1430
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:49,930
the same gold and red color as the armored soldiers

1431
00:58:49,930 --> 00:58:51,930
that greeted you at the front of the palace.

1432
00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:54,210
Next to him, you see Lord Riskell Daxio,

1433
00:58:54,210 --> 00:58:57,020
the elven male who helped you guys handle

1434
00:58:57,020 --> 00:58:58,410
the purchasing of the keep

1435
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:01,200
when you were awarded that at the end of your last journey.

1436
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:04,040
He's the Master of Trade currently within Emon.

1437
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:08,640
You can see he has long strawberry blonde hair

1438
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,270
that is pulled into a tight ponytail to the back.

1439
00:59:10,270 --> 00:59:11,820
He wears darker clothing,

1440
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:14,900
more for decoration than actual use.

1441
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:17,340
His armor seems to be loose and more decorative.

1442
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:23,440
Next to him is Guardian Tofor Brotorus,

1443
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,280
which you've heard of but have not met before.

1444
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:27,410
A female dragonborn paladin.

1445
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:28,440
MARISHA: Say that one more time?

1446
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,690
Guardian who's a what now?

1447
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:31,930
MATT: Guardian Tofor Bratoras.

1448
00:59:31,930 --> 00:59:33,080
MARISHA: To-for?

1449
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:34,320
MATT: T-O-F-O-R.

1450
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:37,290
Bratoras. Her name's been mentioned before but this is

1451
00:59:37,290 --> 00:59:39,340
the first time you guys have actually seen her in person.

1452
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:40,220
ASHLEY: It's a girl?

1453
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:41,800
MATT: It's a female dragonborn paladin.

1454
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:47,600
She is adorned in full, silvered platinum plate.

1455
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:51,100
That has currently carved multiple symbols of Bahamut,

1456
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:52,300
the Platinum Dragon.

1457
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:56,560
As she looks up and notices, you can see

1458
00:59:56,560 --> 01:00:01,320
she gives a hand up, a symbol of greetings towards Kima.

1459
01:00:01,950 --> 01:00:03,050
As Kima also gives her hand up

1460
01:00:03,050 --> 01:00:04,570
and they both touch the front of their armor

1461
01:00:04,570 --> 01:00:05,840
in a symbolic holy way,

1462
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:08,140
they both being followers of Bahamut.

1463
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:09,840
You immediately make that religious connection

1464
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:10,660
between the two of them.

1465
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:13,620
She looks across at the rest of the group there

1466
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:17,380
that she doesn't seem to notice, eyes meeting with Tiberius.

1467
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:18,030
This is strange.

1468
01:00:18,030 --> 01:00:20,290
You haven't seen very many dragonborn at all within Emon,

1469
01:00:20,290 --> 01:00:22,840
and as soon as she meets your gaze,

1470
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:26,640
she gives you a look of deep, deep stinkeye.

1471
01:00:27,770 --> 01:00:30,780
TIBERIUS: Hello. My name is Tiberius Stormwind.

1472
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:32,780
Of House Stormwind, from Draconia.

1473
01:00:33,770 --> 01:00:35,210
Tofor: "From Draconia, you say?"

1474
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:37,850
TIBERIUS: Yes. I'm sure you've heard of

1475
01:00:37,850 --> 01:00:40,580
my father Kravanas, my mother Penelope?

1476
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:42,460
Tofor: "And perhaps you should close that trap

1477
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:45,260
and sit across the table as far from me as possible. "

1478
01:00:46,530 --> 01:00:48,350
MATT: She seems to spit the words almost,

1479
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:49,740
and sits back in her chair.

1480
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:51,550
TIBERIUS: Mind your tongue.

1481
01:00:53,790 --> 01:00:56,460
MATT: The rest of the council's talking amongst themselves

1482
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:58,190
and hearing this slight discussion.

1483
01:00:58,190 --> 01:01:02,290
Next to her there is a halfling male, in a ranger-ish garb,

1484
01:01:02,290 --> 01:01:05,980
wearing what looks like some really fine chain shirt,

1485
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:08,600
with a thick dark black cloak.

1486
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,810
He is shaved bald with tattoos on one side of his face,

1487
01:01:11,810 --> 01:01:14,020
and he introduces himself.

1488
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:16,830
MALE: "I'm terribly, sorry. I did not mean

1489
01:01:16,830 --> 01:01:19,980
"for there to be any sort of misunderstanding here."

1490
01:01:20,190 --> 01:01:22,990
MATT: He gives a slight nudge to Tofor.

1491
01:01:22,990 --> 01:01:25,290
MALE: "I do not believe we've met at this time.

1492
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:27,290
"My name is Seeker Asum Emring.

1493
01:01:27,290 --> 01:01:29,490
"I am the master of secrets here within the council."

1494
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:32,190
MATT: He extends his hand towards you,

1495
01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:34,980
almost like alleviating the tension.

1496
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:37,920
TIBERIUS: Hi. Stormwind here.

1497
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:40,610
Seeker Asum: "I assume you're the ones we're waiting for,

1498
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:41,230
"please have a seat."

1499
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:43,890
MATT: At which the sovereign finishes discussion with

1500
01:01:43,890 --> 01:01:45,480
another human which you have not met.

1501
01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:48,340
He is a built and armored individual,

1502
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:51,040
stands probably the tallest of the entire group,

1503
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,860
thick square jaw, unshaven.

1504
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:56,570
At which point he puts his hand

1505
01:01:56,570 --> 01:01:58,050
on the sovereign's shoulder and says,

1506
01:01:58,050 --> 01:02:00,940
MALE: "I suppose I should introduce myself as well.

1507
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:03,410
"I've heard much about you, Vox Machina.

1508
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:06,060
"I am Arbiter Braum Goldhand.

1509
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:10,380
"I have recently taken up as of three months ago

1510
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:13,860
"the position that General Kreig once held within the city.

1511
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:17,040
"Since he was unfortunately lost to us,

1512
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:20,160
"there was a need for a new master of law.

1513
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,160
"As since I've had a lot to keep up on.

1514
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:25,370
"Unable to meet you personally until now,

1515
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:26,340
"but it is a pleasure.

1516
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:27,870
"I've heard nothing but great things."

1517
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:30,740
MATT: He sits down in his chair.

1518
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:32,750
Allura finds her

1519
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:34,640
side of the table and gestures the rest of you.

1520
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:35,790
ALLURA: "Please, have a seat."

1521
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:40,980
TIBERIUS: I stand. I don't sit.

1522
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:43,000
MATT: All right.

1523
01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:45,660
MATT: The overeign finishes writing some papers,

1524
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:49,390
rolls them up, snaps twice, and a gentleman comes by.

1525
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:50,520
He hands him the papers and says,

1526
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:52,260
URIEL TALDOREI: "Get this to Lady and Lord Briarwood

1527
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:53,320
"as soon as possible, thank you."

1528
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:55,090
URIEL: "All right.

1529
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:59,850
"First of all, I want to welcome you all back.

1530
01:02:59,850 --> 01:03:03,380
"It's been a few weeks since we've seen each other.

1531
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:06,740
"I've been recently given word that you unceremoniously

1532
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:08,590
"appeared in the center of

1533
01:03:08,590 --> 01:03:13,580
"the Lyceum not but twelve hours ago,

1534
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:14,490
"worse for wear.

1535
01:03:15,490 --> 01:03:17,820
"So I would like to know, first off,

1536
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:21,480
"why you've returned in the center of our city.

1537
01:03:23,130 --> 01:03:24,600
"And I want to see how you've all

1538
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:27,740
"been these past few weeks.

1539
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:29,070
"I apologize if I'm a bit scattered

1540
01:03:29,070 --> 01:03:31,560
"I’ve had a few things on my mind as of late.

1541
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:33,310
"But yes, how is Vox Machina."

1542
01:03:34,810 --> 01:03:35,680
VAX: If I may.

1543
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:39,490
We didn't choose to dump ourselves

1544
01:03:39,490 --> 01:03:40,830
right in the middle of the city.

1545
01:03:41,530 --> 01:03:44,850
That was born out of necessity, not out of choice.

1546
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:51,180
The task we set out to finish proved

1547
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:55,680
a lot more complicated than originally perceived.

1548
01:03:57,490 --> 01:04:00,830
Frankly, I worry about the safety of the city of Kraghammer.

1549
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:07,720
Underneath their home down in the bowels of the earth,

1550
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:09,480
I'm don't know how much the council knows

1551
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:11,480
about the race of the illithid.

1552
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,830
We stumbled into a veritable

1553
01:04:14,830 --> 01:04:17,570
hornets' nest of them below the city.

1554
01:04:17,570 --> 01:04:19,840
MATT: Most faces are blank.

1555
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:23,940
Allura has her hands on the table, listening intently.

1556
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:27,210
As you say illithid, you do notice that Seeker Asum Emring,

1557
01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:30,030
the halfling, immediately sits back in his chair

1558
01:04:30,030 --> 01:04:31,980
with a look of 'oh, snap'.

1559
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:37,330
VAX: I see a lot of blank stares at this table.

1560
01:04:38,730 --> 01:04:41,300
I wasn't very familiar with them either.

1561
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:44,220
There is an entire city in the underdark

1562
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:45,640
beneath Kraghammer.

1563
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:49,130
And...

1564
01:04:49,130 --> 01:04:53,330
... in their midst was a beholder

1565
01:04:53,330 --> 01:04:55,800
that was controlling the entire city.

1566
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,470
We ended up destroying it,

1567
01:04:57,470 --> 01:05:00,120
barely escaping with our lives.

1568
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:05,380
Fleeing the city... destroying a god? I think.

1569
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:07,160
VEX: I don't think we destroyed the god.

1570
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:10,300
TIBERIUS: The beholder is merely a demi-demon.

1571
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:12,680
VEX: Yes, it was something he had possessed,

1572
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:14,170
but the god still lives.

1573
01:05:14,650 --> 01:05:20,000
LIAM: Yes, but Orcus was behind the beholder.

1574
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:24,430
MARISHA: We just have the horn.

1575
01:05:24,430 --> 01:05:26,570
LIAM: We killed K'varn

1576
01:05:26,570 --> 01:05:27,940
and then he got back up again.

1577
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:29,140
He didn't get himself back up.

1578
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:31,760
KEYLETH: Because Orcus is a god of necromancy and undeath.

1579
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:32,840
ORION: That's what the horn did.

1580
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:34,650
It brought him back to life when he would die.

1581
01:05:34,650 --> 01:05:36,340
That's why I ripped it out when we did it

1582
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:37,860
because I knew that's what was going on.

1583
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:39,300
That's what the horn does.

1584
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:44,640
LIAM: I just worry that it's not just an appliance.

1585
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,090
It's got hidden in it something --

1586
01:05:47,090 --> 01:05:48,080
ORION: It absolutely has --

1587
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:50,730
Remember, it laughed at me when I tried to crush it --

1588
01:05:50,730 --> 01:05:51,980
LIAM: --is what I'm saying.

1589
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:53,280
MATT: Allura looks at you strangely.

1590
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:54,780
ALLURA: "Tiberius, you sound different."

1591
01:05:55,890 --> 01:05:57,230
ORION: I was talking to --

1592
01:05:57,230 --> 01:05:57,890
MATT: I know.

1593
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:04,680
VAX: Be that as it may we riled up a city of --

1594
01:06:05,770 --> 01:06:06,750
PERCY: Mind flayers.

1595
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:09,300
VAX: Buttholes as Tiberius would call them.

1596
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:15,840
-- very unhappy race of things

1597
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:17,380
below the surface of the earth.

1598
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:20,530
Now, we're here today because Tiberius,

1599
01:06:20,530 --> 01:06:23,550
crafty as he is, was able to flee ahead of us

1600
01:06:23,550 --> 01:06:25,340
and create a portal back here.

1601
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:28,600
We ended up falling ass over tea kettle

1602
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:30,330
in the Lyceum, so here we are.

1603
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:33,080
URIEL: "Well, welcome back."

1604
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:34,040
VAX: Thank you.

1605
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:35,580
URIEL: "It's glad to see you're safe."

1606
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:38,810
VAX: We've brought a little bit of the evil with us.

1607
01:06:38,810 --> 01:06:40,460
MATT: At which point the table gets

1608
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:42,680
extremely uncomfortable, suddenly.

1609
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:44,770
As everyone steps back, Kima steps forward.

1610
01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:46,410
She's kept to the back at this point, and says,

1611
01:06:46,830 --> 01:06:48,830
KIMA: "It's all right.

1612
01:06:48,830 --> 01:06:50,240
"I will speak for this group

1613
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:55,560
"as you also know of their exploits and their abilities.

1614
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:57,290
"They saved me from what was probably

1615
01:06:57,290 --> 01:06:59,570
"certain death and torture and aided me

1616
01:06:59,570 --> 01:07:01,410
"in stopping what darkness was beneath Kraghammer.

1617
01:07:01,410 --> 01:07:02,440
"At least what we could.

1618
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:05,690
"But, listen to what they have to say

1619
01:07:05,690 --> 01:07:08,500
"and understand they are as trustworthy as they come."

1620
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:10,200
MATT: At which point the sovereign

1621
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:11,170
lifts a hand up to her and says,

1622
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,570
URIEL: "Well Kima, your word is trusted

1623
01:07:15,570 --> 01:07:19,720
"and I appreciate you also have returned to us healthy.

1624
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:22,650
"So. What is this evil you bring with you?"

1625
01:07:25,570 --> 01:07:27,740
VAX: We have it stored safely away.

1626
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:28,420
KEYLETH: Yes.

1627
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:31,870
VAX: But this beholder...

1628
01:07:31,870 --> 01:07:34,130
... was using an artifact, a horn.

1629
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:38,270
Emanating darkness and shit.

1630
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:42,610
And Tiberius, in the heat of the battle,

1631
01:07:42,610 --> 01:07:44,610
ripped it from its pate.

1632
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:47,470
And we brought it back with us.

1633
01:07:47,470 --> 01:07:50,290
KEYLETH: It is one of the two horns of Orcus.

1634
01:07:50,910 --> 01:07:53,490
MATT: At that notification, you say the name Orcus,

1635
01:07:53,490 --> 01:07:55,770
and you can see there's a whole energy shift

1636
01:07:55,770 --> 01:07:57,180
in the room at which point.

1637
01:07:57,180 --> 01:08:02,410
A lot of furrowed brows drop to intense.

1638
01:08:03,740 --> 01:08:05,580
The actual air of the room seems to go

1639
01:08:05,580 --> 01:08:06,770
still for a moment.

1640
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:09,150
From what you can see,

1641
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:14,910
Seeker Asum and Tofor both

1642
01:08:14,910 --> 01:08:17,500
grit their teeth and lean forward as you say this.

1643
01:08:19,450 --> 01:08:21,520
Tofor says,

1644
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:22,820
Tofor: "You said Orcus?"

1645
01:08:24,580 --> 01:08:25,050
PERCY: Yes.

1646
01:08:25,050 --> 01:08:26,180
TIBERIUS: Are you deaf?

1647
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:27,720
KEYLETH: Tiberius.

1648
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:28,750
PERCY: Manners.

1649
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,480
VAX: We see the apprehension written on your faces

1650
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:36,190
and we are nervous as well.

1651
01:08:36,510 --> 01:08:39,730
But the alternative was leaving the horn

1652
01:08:39,730 --> 01:08:42,040
with these illithid.

1653
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:44,720
Hundreds if not thousands of illithid.

1654
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:49,250
We had to make a judgement call rather quickly, and... 

1655
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:51,950
... frankly leaving it there with them seemed

1656
01:08:51,950 --> 01:08:53,300
like it wasn't an option.

1657
01:08:53,820 --> 01:08:55,920
Tofor: "You've done right in bringing it here.

1658
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,920
"This has to be destroyed.

1659
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:00,960
"Sent as far away--

1660
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:03,250
"If this is indeed an artifact of Orcus,

1661
01:09:03,970 --> 01:09:05,980
"it cannot exist on this plane."

1662
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:10,430
PERCY: Plans must be drawn up.

1663
01:09:10,430 --> 01:09:11,560
KEYLETH: That's kind of what we thought.

1664
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:13,010
TIBERIUS: Yes we knew this already.

1665
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:16,260
MATT: At which point Kima steps forward and says

1666
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:19,080
KIMA: "Now, understand this is not something

1667
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:21,900
"you can lock in a box, or put some guards around it.

1668
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,330
"There was a reason this was forgotten

1669
01:09:25,330 --> 01:09:26,800
"and needs to be again.

1670
01:09:29,650 --> 01:09:36,660
"With the proper surrounding strength and

1671
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:38,840
"formidable individuals,

1672
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:42,180
"I can take it to the grand chantry in Osthania

1673
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:44,460
"where the High Paladin Archibald will reseal it.

1674
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:46,660
"Far away from the eyes and minds of the world.

1675
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:49,360
"Lest we can come up with some sort of

1676
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:50,650
"way to destroy this item."

1677
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:56,030
MATT: At which point the Arbiter, Braum, steps forward.

1678
01:09:57,320 --> 01:09:59,120
Arbiter Braum: "If you think there's possibly a way

1679
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:02,270
"to destroy this, we need to discover this here.

1680
01:10:03,790 --> 01:10:06,130
"We cannot allow it outside of the midst of this,

1681
01:10:06,130 --> 01:10:08,850
"to some chaotic winds and whim of the world around us.

1682
01:10:08,850 --> 01:10:11,420
"We have the walls of Emon to keep it safe.

1683
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:12,860
"Why not take it to the Lyceum."

1684
01:10:12,860 --> 01:10:14,860
VAX: I want to make an insight check on the whole table.

1685
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:16,110
TRAVIS: Dang.

1686
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:20,140
TALIESIN: I want to also double-check,

1687
01:10:20,140 --> 01:10:22,350
who was it that handed off the letter to the Briarwoods?

1688
01:10:23,860 --> 01:10:24,890
MATT: That was the sovereign.

1689
01:10:24,890 --> 01:10:26,040
TALIESIN: Sovereign? Thank you.

1690
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:32,610
MATT: So which individual, the Arbiter?

1691
01:10:32,610 --> 01:10:33,470
LIAM: Yeah.

1692
01:10:33,470 --> 01:10:34,850
MATT: Okay, Arbiter Braum. What'd you roll?

1693
01:10:34,850 --> 01:10:35,810
LIAM: Just a ten.

1694
01:10:35,810 --> 01:10:36,240
MATT: Ten?

1695
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:37,570
ASHLEY: Can I insight the seeker?

1696
01:10:37,570 --> 01:10:38,210
MATT: Sure.

1697
01:10:44,510 --> 01:10:45,630
MATT: What's your insight roll?

1698
01:10:48,570 --> 01:10:49,520
ASHLEY: Thirteen.

1699
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:50,110
MATT: Thirteen? Okay.

1700
01:10:50,110 --> 01:10:51,820
TALIESIN: I would like to insight the sovereign

1701
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:53,230
just because, reasons.

1702
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:56,290
PIKE: Yeah, we do.
TALIESIN: One.

1703
01:10:57,310 --> 01:10:58,800
MATT: Starting the game off strong guys.

1704
01:11:02,540 --> 01:11:03,980
LAURA: I think you need some Florida rolling.

1705
01:11:03,980 --> 01:11:05,940
TALIESIN: I'm just an idiot thinking.
LAURA: I think you need some Florida rolling.

1706
01:11:05,940 --> 01:11:08,020
LIAM: Yeah, I think so too. You're awfully quiet.

1707
01:11:08,020 --> 01:11:09,890
LAURA: I'm going to insight check as well!

1708
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,500
LAURA: Because Matt can totally whisper to me

1709
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:13,690
if I get this good.

1710
01:11:14,730 --> 01:11:15,230
LIAM: He'll text you.

1711
01:11:15,230 --> 01:11:16,260
MATT: I'll text it to you.

1712
01:11:18,410 --> 01:11:19,580
LIAM: Roll high.

1713
01:11:19,580 --> 01:11:21,380
LAURA: Hold on, I'm looking.

1714
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:22,620
TRAVIS: She's rolling.

1715
01:11:25,230 --> 01:11:26,720
LAURA: Seventeen.

1716
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:27,970
MATT: Eleventeen?

1717
01:11:28,650 --> 01:11:29,260
TRAVIS: Seventeen!

1718
01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:30,060
LAURA: Seventeen!

1719
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:31,920
MATT: A total of 17?

1720
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:32,840
LIAM: Eleventy-seven.

1721
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:33,530
LAURA: Yeah.

1722
01:11:33,530 --> 01:11:34,510
MATT: On which individual?

1723
01:11:37,340 --> 01:11:39,340
LIAM: Which person at the table, sis?

1724
01:11:39,890 --> 01:11:41,000
LAURA: You.

1725
01:11:44,140 --> 01:11:45,320
LIAM: Your brother?

1726
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:49,300
LAURA: Oh no! On the deep voiced guy!

1727
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:50,220
ASHLEY: The Arbiter.

1728
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:51,310
MATT: Okay. Arbiter Braum.

1729
01:11:51,310 --> 01:11:52,480
LAURA: Yes, the arbiter.

1730
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:53,940
(all laugh)

1731
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:54,510
MATT: Okay.

1732
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:55,140
MARISHA: You!

1733
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:56,510
LIAM: Why you gotta be like that, huh?

1734
01:11:57,870 --> 01:12:01,210
MATT: I'll say in a general feel about the room,

1735
01:12:01,210 --> 01:12:02,720
but the arbiter specifically,

1736
01:12:03,950 --> 01:12:09,050
There is definitely a very quick rising in tension, fear,

1737
01:12:09,050 --> 01:12:11,230
and adrenaline in the room at this conversation.

1738
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:14,880
Fear is the main thing you're getting.

1739
01:12:17,710 --> 01:12:19,720
I wouldn't say that you sense any deception.

1740
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:22,820
You just sense that the stakes have just suddenly jumped

1741
01:12:22,820 --> 01:12:24,910
from what they were expecting their morning to be.

1742
01:12:24,910 --> 01:12:26,650
They're trying to wrap their head around it.

1743
01:12:27,630 --> 01:12:33,130
So nothing too particular catches your shit radar.

1744
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:35,050
LAURA: All right.

1745
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:37,310
GROG: We are not leaving the horn here.

1746
01:12:39,010 --> 01:12:39,600
VEX: No..

1747
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,230
PERCY: We would have to leave you here.

1748
01:12:41,850 --> 01:12:44,090
MATT: As Grog speaks up for the Arbiter, he says,

1749
01:12:44,090 --> 01:12:46,750
Arbiter Braum: "I'm not saying we leave it here.

1750
01:12:46,750 --> 01:12:49,680
"I'm saying that while we have it here, we have it studied.

1751
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:50,750
"Bring it to the Lyceum.

1752
01:12:50,750 --> 01:12:52,680
"The headmaster and his entire research facility

1753
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:55,040
"could possibly find a way to destroy it.

1754
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:59,700
"There is no finer arcane focus

1755
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:01,160
"than that lyceum in the city.

1756
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:05,130
"They're responsible for the construction of our sky ships.

1757
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:07,900
"And the crystals that keep them elevated."

1758
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:09,320
TIBERIUS: I love skyships.

1759
01:13:10,730 --> 01:13:13,000
VEX: I believe the power would be too great.

1760
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,100
It will corrupt.

1761
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:17,090
People will want to take it for  themselves.

1762
01:13:17,090 --> 01:13:20,180
Arbiter Braum: "Then it has to be taken elsewhere and sealed.

1763
01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:21,610
"Like Kima was requesting."

1764
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:24,220
KEYLETH: So you're saying essentially our two options are

1765
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:26,440
we can either keep it here and study it to try

1766
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:29,070
and figure out a way to destroy it

1767
01:13:29,070 --> 01:13:32,830
and have all of the risks of this horn being inside the city

1768
01:13:32,830 --> 01:13:36,530
or we take the other massive risks of

1769
01:13:36,530 --> 01:13:38,560
trying to ship it off somewhere

1770
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:40,210
and hope that it gets sealed away?

1771
01:13:40,210 --> 01:13:42,770
MATT: At which point, Tofor the female dragonborn

1772
01:13:42,770 --> 01:13:44,400
sits up in her chair and says,

1773
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:48,010
Tofor: "Regardless. It should not stay here in my opinion.

1774
01:13:48,650 --> 01:13:50,990
"Understand the longer it resides within Emon,

1775
01:13:50,990 --> 01:13:52,590
"the more word will spread.

1776
01:13:53,050 --> 01:13:56,190
"And more despots will be drawn to our city to claim it.

1777
01:13:56,810 --> 01:13:58,910
"Do you wish to have all the darkness of this land

1778
01:13:58,910 --> 01:14:00,580
"slowly swarm in on the city?"

1779
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:03,370
VAX: I think we're of a like mind.

1780
01:14:03,370 --> 01:14:03,930
TIBERIUS: Yes.

1781
01:14:03,930 --> 01:14:05,500
VAX: I think we should take it from the city.

1782
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:07,960
KEYLETH: I think it's a giant target on our backs right now.

1783
01:14:09,230 --> 01:14:10,690
ORION: I turn to the Arbiter.

1784
01:14:10,690 --> 01:14:12,690
TIBERIUS: There is something that you should know.

1785
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:16,330
During our battle with K'varn,

1786
01:14:16,330 --> 01:14:17,700
which was the name of the beholder,

1787
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:20,730
which the horn resided upon its head.

1788
01:14:20,730 --> 01:14:22,180
When I ripped it from its head,

1789
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:24,650
I held it in the telekinesis state.

1790
01:14:24,650 --> 01:14:28,960
I attempted to crush it for not knowing what it was at first.

1791
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:32,120
Just knowing it was bringing creatures back to life.

1792
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:36,610
When I attempted to do so, I heard

1793
01:14:36,610 --> 01:14:40,920
somewhat of a laughter in the back of my mind.

1794
01:14:42,210 --> 01:14:47,870
I fear whatever this is attached to might be aware,

1795
01:14:47,870 --> 01:14:51,160
or if anything, more aware than it was previously.

1796
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:54,430
I'm not sure if it was alerted by being placed

1797
01:14:54,430 --> 01:14:55,980
on the beholder's head to begin with,

1798
01:14:57,010 --> 01:15:00,500
but I heard something.

1799
01:15:02,220 --> 01:15:04,300
ORION: Looking at Tofor.

1800
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:05,770
TIBERIUS: I agree with the peasant.

1801
01:15:05,770 --> 01:15:08,610
That we should get it out of here immediately.

1802
01:15:11,690 --> 01:15:12,700
MATT: At which point the sovereign

1803
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:14,350
who's been kinda quiet this moment, says,

1804
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:19,470
URIEL: "Well. Best I can tell at this point,

1805
01:15:19,470 --> 01:15:20,990
"it should not stay in Emon.

1806
01:15:20,990 --> 01:15:22,460
"We've had enough trouble in this city

1807
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:25,160
"and enough issues here that we're having to deal with

1808
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:28,010
"in the aftermath of the attack on my family.

1809
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:34,010
"We do not have the mental will nor the ability

1810
01:15:34,010 --> 01:15:36,210
"to withstand any sort of assault either from

1811
01:15:36,210 --> 01:15:37,820
"the inside or the outside of the city.

1812
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:40,750
"If we are to take it elsewhere

1813
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:45,650
"I trust the opinion of you, of Kima, and Allura."

1814
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:49,320
MATT: At which point Allura takes a moment and says,

1815
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:51,710
ALLURA: "Just the knowledge of such a thing existing,

1816
01:15:51,710 --> 01:15:54,660
"let alone two, in this world is dangerous.

1817
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:58,330
"Who knows what horrors an individual could achieve

1818
01:15:58,330 --> 01:15:59,980
"should they find both horns.

1819
01:16:01,810 --> 01:16:04,080
"Now, wherever this gets taken,

1820
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:07,360
"the knowledge that all of us know that these exist now,

1821
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:10,660
"and anyone else beyond this, means that that's a leak.

1822
01:16:11,740 --> 01:16:13,250
"That's a weakness.

1823
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:15,960
"Now I've heard of some magics

1824
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:18,670
"that can erase selective memories permanently.

1825
01:16:19,370 --> 01:16:20,270
"Ancient magics."

1826
01:16:20,270 --> 01:16:21,940
MATT: At which point as she starts saying this,

1827
01:16:21,940 --> 01:16:23,550
the rest of the room shifts uncomfortably.

1828
01:16:23,550 --> 01:16:25,490
You can see Tofor begins to raise her hand to protest.

1829
01:16:25,490 --> 01:16:27,150
Allura shuts her down and says,

1830
01:16:27,150 --> 01:16:29,680
ALLURA: "But, I'd not employ these

1831
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:31,550
"unless they were absolutely necessary.

1832
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:36,520
"I need to speak with the Arcana Pentsafocal

1833
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:38,340
"and see if this is

1834
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:41,060
"such a strange and necessary circumstance

1835
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:43,630
"to allow the use of such magics.

1836
01:16:43,630 --> 01:16:44,600
"That will take me some time

1837
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:45,930
"to get the entire conclave to agree,

1838
01:16:45,930 --> 01:16:47,370
"but I think it's possible.

1839
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:49,340
"It may be the only way, if we can not destroy this,

1840
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:51,340
"to make sure that the rest of this

1841
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:53,340
"world never knows that it existed.

1842
01:16:54,490 --> 01:16:56,240
"I think that's the safest route.

1843
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:57,860
"As for getting it out of the city

1844
01:16:57,860 --> 01:17:01,370
"I feel that we have two individuals here,

1845
01:17:01,370 --> 01:17:02,860
"two followers of Bahamut,

1846
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:05,120
"both the deity that saw the deity,

1847
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:06,840
"brought the vision to Kima,

1848
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:10,080
"and presented, whether in a roundabout way,

1849
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:12,290
"the power and strength of these individuals

1850
01:17:12,290 --> 01:17:13,760
"to eventually retrieve it

1851
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:16,010
"and prevent it from being an artifact that

1852
01:17:16,010 --> 01:17:17,760
"instrumentally destroyed the dwarven city

1853
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,390
"and quite possibly all of Tal'Dorei.

1854
01:17:19,980 --> 01:17:23,070
"So I think if there was a god whose guidance

1855
01:17:23,070 --> 01:17:24,140
"we can look into,

1856
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:27,770
"I would put my trust in the clergy of Bahamut."

1857
01:17:28,670 --> 01:17:31,010
MATT: She looks to Kima. Kima nods her head.

1858
01:17:32,090 --> 01:17:34,440
TIBERIUS: Of course we'd agree with such sentiments as well.

1859
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:41,050
MATT: Kima raises her maul and says,

1860
01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:44,700
KIMA: Well then, if that's to be the case,

1861
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:47,140
"I'll send word over to the rest of my temple.

1862
01:17:47,810 --> 01:17:49,570
"We'll send over our finest paladins,

1863
01:17:49,570 --> 01:17:51,470
"clerics, and guardians.

1864
01:17:51,470 --> 01:17:54,130
"Prepare a box for travel. We'll take it across the sea.

1865
01:17:54,970 --> 01:17:56,700
"Then we shall seal this bastard."

1866
01:17:56,700 --> 01:17:57,320
TIBERIUS: Kima.

1867
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:59,530
GROG: Yeah! Oh. Sorry.

1868
01:17:59,530 --> 01:18:01,650
(all laugh)

1869
01:18:01,650 --> 01:18:05,100
TIBERIUS: Kima, when you do approach your king,

1870
01:18:06,510 --> 01:18:13,300
propose because Orcus's horn is pure black evil,

1871
01:18:13,710 --> 01:18:16,370
perhaps the side of light can help as well.

1872
01:18:16,370 --> 01:18:19,650
The blessing of Sarenrae and other light sources,

1873
01:18:19,650 --> 01:18:22,060
divine powers, could be helpful as well.

1874
01:18:22,060 --> 01:18:23,260
KIMA: "The horn will remain here

1875
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:25,210
"until the vessel is brought over.

1876
01:18:25,210 --> 01:18:28,120
"But we have holy vessels specifically designed for the

1877
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:31,640
"keeping of remains or things that are of great evil.

1878
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:33,700
"We would gladly welcome the blessing

1879
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:35,570
"of something from Sarenrae as well.

"After all, there is nothing wrong with more positive energy

1881
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:40,730
"instilled to maintain such a negative force."

1882
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:44,350
KEYLETH: I personally don't trust this horn

1883
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:48,810
travelling anywhere without at least one of our supervision.

1884
01:18:48,810 --> 01:18:50,660
MATT: At which point the sovereign speaks up and says,

1885
01:18:50,660 --> 01:18:54,250
URIEL: "And to be completely honest,

1886

"we are very grateful you've brought the horn here.

1887

"None.

"Just keep that in mind."

ORION: I look to the group and do this to Scanlan.

TALIESIN: Taking quite advantage of his current state of mind.

1902

ORION: You have no idea what I'm going to do

1903
01:19:41,930 --> 01:19:43,360
for the rest of this game.

1904
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:44,930
TRAVIS: You literally do that to Scanlan.

1905
01:19:44,930 --> 01:19:46,700
Like you... to Scanlan?

1906
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:48,800
ORION: No, I was pointing at him.

1907
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:49,740
LIAM: Right in the ear.

1908
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:52,320
MATT: Wet willy. To our little gnome bard.

1909
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:53,310
ORION: (laughs)

1910
01:19:53,310 --> 01:19:54,540
MATT: We miss you Sam.

1911
01:19:56,060 --> 01:19:57,330
MATT: Uriel looks around.

1912
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:00,000
URIEL: "Well, given the circumstance

1913
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,050
"I would say that our best bet now is to

1914
01:20:02,050 --> 01:20:06,300
"have Kima and Tofor reach out to the grand chambers of Bahamut.

1915
01:20:07,230 --> 01:20:10,560
"Have them bring a vessel and seal it somewhere

1916
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:15,960
"that they find fit for an object of this dark presence.

1917
01:20:16,930 --> 01:20:18,690
"Is the council in agreement of this?

1918
01:20:19,550 --> 01:20:23,620
"Unless some other, better means arises.

1919
01:20:23,620 --> 01:20:25,620
"How long will it take for this vessel to arrive?"

1920
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:28,300
MATT: At which point, Kima scratches her chin for a second.

1921
01:20:29,850 --> 01:20:31,260
KIMA: "By the fastest ships,

1922
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:34,520
"especially if we're using some of your fancy sky dinghies.

1923
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:38,100
"I can't imagine more than two weeks?"

1924
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:39,810
KEYLETH: Two weeks?!

1925
01:20:39,810 --> 01:20:41,450
MATT: At which point --

1926
01:20:41,450 --> 01:20:43,950
TIBERIUS: That's 14 days, your highness.

1927
01:20:43,950 --> 01:20:44,840
KEYLETH: (sighs)

1928
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:45,880
VEX: That was adorable.

1929
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:46,910
PIKE: A fortnight?

1930
01:20:46,910 --> 01:20:50,650
MATT: At which point Allura stands forward and says,

1931
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:53,650
ALLURA: "It's in the means of --"

1932
01:20:53,650 --> 01:20:56,270
KEYLETH: You guys don't have any holy ships here.

1933
01:20:56,940 --> 01:20:58,880
You don't have like a ship dock?

1934
01:20:58,880 --> 01:20:59,870
TIBERIUS: I'm sure if they did

1935
01:20:59,870 --> 01:21:01,450
they would probably use that one.

1936
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:03,980
TALIESIN: But I'm using it.

1937
01:21:03,980 --> 01:21:07,570
(all laugh)

1938
01:21:15,310 --> 01:21:17,080
MATT: At this point Allura

1939
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:18,920
sits forward and to the rest of the group, says,

1940
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:23,540
ALLURA: "To be fair Kima, in my experience and knowledge,

1941
01:21:23,540 --> 01:21:25,620
"ships function well for the movement

1942
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:27,220
"of goods and large objects.

1943
01:21:27,220 --> 01:21:31,580
"The speed of this requires some expediting and

1944
01:21:31,580 --> 01:21:34,580
"I happen to have a friend who is over in Osthania,

1945
01:21:34,580 --> 01:21:36,750
"probably not far from your clergy.

1946
01:21:37,780 --> 01:21:42,100
"Perhaps we can facilitate a two-day travel?"

1947
01:21:42,890 --> 01:21:44,320
MATT: At which point the group leans back

1948
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:45,580
for a second and Kima goes,

1949
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:48,740
KIMA: "Well fine. Yeah, I guess."

1950
01:21:48,740 --> 01:21:50,740
MATT: Shoots a dirty look a little bit to --

1951
01:21:50,740 --> 01:21:53,050
MARISHA: Can I do an insight check on Allura really quick?

1952
01:21:53,050 --> 01:21:53,860
MATT: Sure.

1953
01:21:57,330 --> 01:21:59,370
LIAM: She's saying a ship will be ready in two days

1954
01:21:59,370 --> 01:22:01,280
or take two days to travel?

1955
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:02,240
MATT: Allura's saying,

1956
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:03,760
ALLURA: "Depending on the size of this vessel,

1957
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:04,720
"why do we even need a ship?

1958
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:08,250
"We have the ability to transport between the cities.

1959
01:22:08,250 --> 01:22:10,490
"If we can pool our resources,

1960
01:22:10,490 --> 01:22:11,700
"there's no reason why we can't

1961
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:13,620
"bring them here nearly instantaneously."

1962
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:14,650
MARISHA: Thirteen.

1963
01:22:14,650 --> 01:22:15,310
MATT: Thirteen?

1964
01:22:15,310 --> 01:22:18,620
Best you can tell, Allura's really hard to read.

1965
01:22:18,620 --> 01:22:19,450
She keeps up her smile

1966
01:22:19,450 --> 01:22:21,240
but she definitely has her intense face on.

1967
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:22,380
She's deep in the moment.

1968
01:22:23,690 --> 01:22:25,520
No real gives one way or the other.

1969
01:22:27,930 --> 01:22:30,450
The rest of the group looks around

1970
01:22:30,450 --> 01:22:32,850
and Arcanist in the silence goes,

1971
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:35,330
ALLURA: "Well then, I think that

1972
01:22:35,330 --> 01:22:37,250
"me and Kima and Tofor, if you'd like,

1973
01:22:37,950 --> 01:22:43,230
"we can designate a way of bringing this relic container

1974
01:22:43,230 --> 01:22:45,310
"as fast as possible so we can get this going.

1975
01:22:45,310 --> 01:22:48,400
"I wish not to keep this within our presence much longer.

1976
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:49,460
"Do we agree to that?"

1977
01:22:50,660 --> 01:22:51,040
TIBERIUS: Yes.

1978
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:51,650
PERCY: Yes.

1979
01:22:51,650 --> 01:22:54,770
VAX: I think we would feel comfortable

1980
01:22:54,770 --> 01:22:56,410
going along for the ride

1981
01:22:56,410 --> 01:22:58,410
and seeing this thing through to the end.

1982
01:23:00,450 --> 01:23:01,980
MATT: She glances over to the sovereign.

1983
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:04,420
The sovereign nods.

1984
01:23:05,070 --> 01:23:07,040
URIEL: "Very well. Very well, I'll allow it.

1985
01:23:07,710 --> 01:23:10,360
"I may have some business for you coming soon

1986
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:12,650
"so try not to be gone too long.

1987
01:23:12,650 --> 01:23:16,240
"Although this is much more important business, I do agree."

1988
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:17,530
MATT: Then he gives a laugh and smile

1989
01:23:17,530 --> 01:23:18,530
to raise a bit of levity in the room

1990
01:23:18,530 --> 01:23:20,360
that nobody seems to respond to.

1991
01:23:21,290 --> 01:23:24,210
URIEL: "But nevertheless

1992
01:23:24,210 --> 01:23:26,210
"if you wish to travel and see this through

1993
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:27,980
"I don't see there would be any complaint."

1994
01:23:27,980 --> 01:23:29,440
MATT: He looks to Lady Kima and Kima says,

1995
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:30,800
KIMA: "No, not at all.

1996
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:32,800
"We've gotten along swimmingly so far.

1997
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:33,580
"Mostly.

1998
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:36,910
"Very well.

1999
01:23:39,620 --> 01:23:41,090
"I'm bad at this political stuff."

2000
01:23:41,090 --> 01:23:42,540
MATT: Kima steps back a little bit,

2001
01:23:42,540 --> 01:23:43,980
Kima: "I defer to the rest of you."

2002
01:23:44,370 --> 01:23:47,890
MATT: Puts her maul on the ground and awkwardly looks away.

2003
01:23:47,890 --> 01:23:48,540
The sovereign goes,

2004
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:50,600
URIEL: "Very well. It is settled.

2005
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:52,730
"Reach out to your clergy. Bring the vessel.

2006
01:23:52,730 --> 01:23:54,610
"Allura, facilitate its arrival.

2007
01:23:54,610 --> 01:23:56,780
"We will get this artifact as far away from Emon as possible.

2008
01:23:58,980 --> 01:23:59,820
"This is adjourned.

2009
01:23:59,820 --> 01:24:01,820
"Thank you all very much for coming to this council meeting."

2010
01:24:03,630 --> 01:24:04,410
KEYLETH: Okay.

2011
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:07,680
TALIESIN: I'm going to catch the sovereign on his way out.

2012
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:09,100
MATT: All right.

2013
01:24:09,940 --> 01:24:12,060
At which point everyone gathers the rest of their papers,

2014
01:24:12,060 --> 01:24:13,760
their parchments, they're rolling up scrolls.

2015
01:24:14,490 --> 01:24:17,810
The Arbiter gets up and lumbers his way out of the room.

2016
01:24:17,810 --> 01:24:19,640
The seeker, Asum, steps up to the rest of you

2017
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:20,900
with a final handshake.

2018
01:24:21,330 --> 01:24:23,150
SEEKER ASUM: "A pleasure to meet you all, once again,

2019
01:24:23,150 --> 01:24:25,820
"I've heard so much. You're doing fine work."

2020
01:24:25,820 --> 01:24:33,460
MATT: He seems strangely nervous. But in a weird way,

2021
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:34,940
he's a gentle hint of fanboy.

2022
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:36,940
TRAVIS: Oh.

2023
01:24:36,940 --> 01:24:38,020
LAURA: I wink at him.

2024
01:24:38,020 --> 01:24:39,370
(all laugh)

2025
01:24:40,350 --> 01:24:42,050
MATT: He slyly winks back on his way out.

2026
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:47,020
MATT: As he exits, Tofor stands up.

2027
01:24:47,020 --> 01:24:48,800
You've only seen her sitting since you arrived.

2028
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:51,050
As Tofor stands in her female dragonborn form,

2029
01:24:51,050 --> 01:24:54,570
she is probably a good solid foot taller than Tiberius.

2030
01:24:54,570 --> 01:24:59,380
And is a thick musclebound dragonborn paladin of Bahamut.

2031
01:24:59,380 --> 01:25:01,840
Her armor shifts as she stands,

2032
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:04,000
she begins to make her way towards the door,

2033
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,540
not even with a glance in your direction.

2034
01:25:05,540 --> 01:25:07,140
ORION: That means she's as tall as you, Grog.

2035
01:25:08,370 --> 01:25:09,140
TRAVIS: What?

2036
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:11,080
ORION: She's as tall as you.

2037
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:14,210
MARISHA: I just whisper to Tiberius and say,

2038
01:25:14,210 --> 01:25:18,190
KEYLETH: Are all the ladies that big in Draconia?

2039
01:25:18,190 --> 01:25:21,460
TIBERIUS: It all depends. Not really.

2040
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:22,540
MATT: She's bigger than usual.

2041
01:25:22,540 --> 01:25:25,330
TIBERIUS: She's a wretched peasant so I can not.

2042
01:25:25,330 --> 01:25:26,590
KEYLETH: That's so mean.

2043
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,040
VAX: That's a little harsh.

2044
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:30,370
MATT: Allura stands up and begins to leave.

2045
01:25:30,370 --> 01:25:32,170
The sovereign stands up and as he stands up

2046
01:25:32,170 --> 01:25:34,100
the guards come out and they come to his side.

2047
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:35,890
PERCY: Good Sovereign, if I can have a moment?

2048
01:25:36,580 --> 01:25:39,580
Did I hear correctly that

2049
01:25:39,580 --> 01:25:42,040
Lord and Lady Briarwood were in town?

2050
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:44,440
URIEL: "They were but a week ago."

2051
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:45,660
PERCY: They were but a week ago?

2052
01:25:45,660 --> 01:25:47,660
And they've left, have they?

2053
01:25:47,660 --> 01:25:50,640
URIEL: "Yes. Do you know of Lord and Lady Briarwood?"

2054
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:52,490
PERCY: Just in passing.

2055
01:25:52,490 --> 01:25:55,170
Did they have business in town?

2056
01:25:55,170 --> 01:25:56,610
Was there something in particular?

2057
01:25:56,610 --> 01:25:59,320
I'm just curious. It doesn't really matter.

2058
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:01,450
I mean it does matter but not particularly.

2059
01:26:01,450 --> 01:26:05,240
URIEL: "It was relatively routine, we're establishing

2060

"an official trade route through the northeast.

2061

"Spanning the Boreal Plane to Whitestone."

01:26:08,940 --> 01:26:09,720

URIEL: "They inherited the region after

"the unfortunate demise of the Derolo family."

PERCY: That's nice.

2073
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:40,370
I would love to. Please, keep it quiet,

2074
01:26:40,370 --> 01:26:45,300
but if I could be notified if they're coming through again.

2075
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:48,510
I would like very much to surprise them,

2076
01:26:48,510 --> 01:26:50,040
if that would be possible.

2077
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:52,040
ORION: Am I standing next to Percy?

2078
01:26:52,590 --> 01:26:53,330
Am I hearing this?

2079
01:26:53,330 --> 01:26:53,790
MATT: Yes.

2080
01:26:53,790 --> 01:26:54,430
ORION: Good.

2081
01:26:54,430 --> 01:26:58,560
PERCY: It's just old business.

2082
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,430
It would be very interesting to see them again.

2083
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:02,240
MATT: For the sake of this conversation,

2084
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:03,700
I'm going to ask you to roll a deception check.

2085
01:27:03,700 --> 01:27:04,600
TALIESIN: Okay.

2086
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:09,480
Natural 20.

2087
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:10,660
MARISHA: (cheers)

2088
01:27:10,660 --> 01:27:11,550
ORION: (claps)

2089
01:27:11,550 --> 01:27:12,880
MARISHA: On the new pretty die.

2090
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:13,930
TALIESIN: Don't fuck with me.

2091
01:27:15,550 --> 01:27:17,580
MATT: The Sovereign gives you a look and says,

2092
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:19,020
URIEL: "Certainly.

2093
01:27:19,020 --> 01:27:21,180
"Very well, I will notify you

01:27:21,180 --> 01:27:22,010
"should they come through again."

2095
01:27:22,010 --> 01:27:23,740
PERCY: Deeply honored by your thought, sir. Thank you.

2096
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:25,630
ORION: At the end of this conversation I'm going to

2097
01:27:25,630 --> 01:27:27,730
rip off a piece of the scroll of telescription

2098
01:27:27,730 --> 01:27:28,910
and I'm going to approach.

2099
01:27:29,290 --> 01:27:31,790
TIBERIUS: When you do, all you do is

2100
01:27:31,790 --> 01:27:34,020
write the message to this and we will receive it.

2101
01:27:34,490 --> 01:27:36,560
It's an enchanted parchment.

2102
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:38,250
I will receive the message.

2103
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:39,800
MATT: He tells you,

2104
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:42,220
URIEL: "I know how these work. Yes, thank you."

2105
01:27:42,220 --> 01:27:44,100
MATT: As you present it, he walks by and

2106
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:46,460
one of his guards takes it from you and gives you a nod.

2107
01:27:46,780 --> 01:27:47,920
MATT: They exit the chambers.

2108
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:50,120
You guys are escorted out into the main hallway of the palace.

2109
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:50,820
PIKE: Bye!
MATT: The rest of the council

2110
01:27:50,820 --> 01:27:51,870
MATT: The rest of the council

2111
01:27:51,870 --> 01:27:54,650
scatters amongst the palace proper. You are all left.

2112
01:27:54,650 --> 01:27:58,240
The doors close behind you and the echoing hallways

2113
01:27:58,240 --> 01:27:59,860
towards the central left side of the palace.

2114
01:27:59,860 --> 01:28:00,560
PERCY: (sighs)

2115
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:01,230
KEYLETH: Percy.

2116
01:28:01,230 --> 01:28:01,940
PERCY: I'm fine.

2117
01:28:01,940 --> 01:28:02,660
PIKE: Are you okay?
KEYLETH: You're sweating.

2118
01:28:02,660 --> 01:28:03,440
PERCY: I know.
PIKE: Are you okay?

2119
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:04,420
KEYLETH: Why are you sweating?

2120
01:28:04,420 --> 01:28:05,000
PERCY: It's hot.

2121
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:05,680
KEYLETH: What happened?

2122
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:06,340
PERCY: Nothing.

2123
01:28:06,340 --> 01:28:08,340
The sun comes up and it gets very hot.

2124
01:28:08,340 --> 01:28:09,230
I'll tell you later.

2125
01:28:09,230 --> 01:28:10,320
TIBERIUS: Very good.

2126
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:12,010
PERCY: This is discussion for later.

2127
01:28:12,010 --> 01:28:13,840
There's more important things.

2128
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:17,470
MATT: Kima and Allura are near you.

2129
01:28:17,470 --> 01:28:20,000
At which point, Kima looks at the rest of you and says,

2130
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:24,370
KIMA: "I apologize, I have to figure this out now.

2131
01:28:24,370 --> 01:28:26,130
"So I'm going to head to the nearest temple of Bahamut

2132
01:28:26,130 --> 01:28:27,240
"and see if we could reach out quickly."

2133
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:31,980
KEYLETH: What should we do?

2134
01:28:33,710 --> 01:28:35,000
KIMA: That's up to you.

2135
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,330
MATT: She looks to Allura, questioning Allura.

2136
01:28:37,780 --> 01:28:41,520
ALLURA: "In the event of this

2137
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:44,040
"blessed chamber arriving, you will be notified.

2138
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:45,890
"We will request your presence

2139
01:28:45,890 --> 01:28:48,690
"to bring the artifact in question, seal it,

2140
01:28:48,690 --> 01:28:51,280
"and then we will begin our journey over to its place

2141
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:55,930
"of hopeful destruction and/or proper banishment."

2142
01:28:55,930 --> 01:28:57,570
PIKE: Would you like anyone to go with you

2143
01:28:57,570 --> 01:28:58,970
or you just want to go alone?

2144
01:29:00,270 --> 01:29:00,990
ALLURA: "To?"

2145
01:29:00,990 --> 01:29:04,570
PIKE: To work out the details of all of this?

2146
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:10,210
MATT: Allura says,

2147
01:29:10,210 --> 01:29:11,310
ALLURA: "For me, it's just preparation of

2148
01:29:11,310 --> 01:29:12,910
"the arcane transference ritual.

2149
01:29:12,910 --> 01:29:14,100
"I'm going to go meet with a friend of mine

2150
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:16,960
"over in Ostania."

2151
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:19,450
PERCY: I will say we haven't replenished our potions yet.

2152
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:20,850
And we could go --

2153
01:29:20,850 --> 01:29:23,040
PIKE: Should we go to visit our old friend?

2154
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:24,350
KEYLETH: Gilmore?

2155
01:29:24,350 --> 01:29:24,750
PERCY: We could go to Gilmore's.
KEYLETH: Gilmore?

2156
01:29:24,750 --> 01:29:25,620
PIKE: Gilmore?
PERCY: We could go to Gilmore's.

2157
01:29:25,620 --> 01:29:26,890
PIKE: Gilmore's Glorious Goods?

2158
01:29:27,730 --> 01:29:30,240
KEYLETH: You essentially want us to wait?

2159
01:29:32,530 --> 01:29:33,620
ALLURA: "Whatever business you need to get done.

2160
01:29:33,620 --> 01:29:34,660
"It should take no more than two days

2161
01:29:34,660 --> 01:29:36,920
"to get this taken care of."

2162
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:40,130
KEYLETH: You guys, we have a weekend!

2163
01:29:40,130 --> 01:29:41,310
(all laugh)

2164
01:29:41,310 --> 01:29:43,770
LIAM: This is Allura and Kima who are here?

2165
01:29:43,770 --> 01:29:44,500
MATT: Yeah, they're the only two who have

2166
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:46,660
stayed behind with you guys outside of the council chambers.

2167
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:51,460
LIAM: I take Pike by the hand and I walk over to Kima.

2168
01:29:51,460 --> 01:29:53,700
And they're short so I kneel down.

2169
01:29:53,700 --> 01:29:55,800
I say to the both of them.

2170
01:29:56,290 --> 01:29:58,920
VAX: I've never pretended to be a man of the cloth,

2171
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:00,920
I know little of the gods.

2172
01:30:01,210 --> 01:30:05,900
But the brush we had down below has left me shaken.

2173
01:30:07,220 --> 01:30:09,900
What can the gods tell us?

2174
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:12,690
The gods stick their noses into our doings

2175
01:30:12,690 --> 01:30:14,440
whenever it pleases them.

2176
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:16,160
Are they not here?

2177
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:19,160
Have they anything to say for what is happening now?

2178
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:22,040
MARISHA: I'm with this guy! High five Vax.

2179
01:30:22,610 --> 01:30:27,120
MATT: At which point-- did you wish to respond in any way?

2180
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:29,330
PIKE: Well, I just know that

2181
01:30:29,330 --> 01:30:34,900
I tried to have a response from my god down below

2182
01:30:34,900 --> 01:30:38,170
and she didn't really respond the way

2183
01:30:38,170 --> 01:30:40,520
I would have liked for her to.

2184
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:42,830
But maybe things will be different.

2185
01:30:43,620 --> 01:30:45,080
What were you going to say?

2186
01:30:45,620 --> 01:30:48,280
MATT: At which point Kima looks to you,

2187
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:51,870
at what you just said with curious worry.

2188
01:30:51,870 --> 01:30:57,210
KIMA: "Well, if what you say is your faith has been shaken,

2189
01:30:58,100 --> 01:31:01,850
"there is always room at the temple of Bahamut

2190
01:31:01,850 --> 01:31:04,820
"to find redemption, strength, and guidance.

2191
01:31:04,820 --> 01:31:05,890
"You realize the platinum --"

2192
01:31:05,890 --> 01:31:07,280
MARISHA: She's trying to get you to come to her church.

2193
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:07,980
MATT: (laughs)

2194
01:31:07,980 --> 01:31:09,240
PIKE: She's trying to convert.

2195
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:11,650
MARISHA: She's trying to convert! Get the leaflet.

2196
01:31:11,650 --> 01:31:13,290
KIMA: "The platinum dragon has guided

2197
01:31:13,290 --> 01:31:16,530
"much of civilization's growth, expansion, and survival

2198
01:31:16,530 --> 01:31:18,730
"for thousands of years.

2199
01:31:18,730 --> 01:31:21,960
"The eternal battle between him and the darkness

2200
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:23,550
"that is Tiamat and the chaos beyond that --"

2201
01:31:23,550 --> 01:31:26,580
KEYLETH: With all due respect, Kima,

2202
01:31:26,580 --> 01:31:28,940
I don't think that was Vax's question.

2203
01:31:30,670 --> 01:31:33,630
KIMA: "To get to the point, I apologize.

2204
01:31:33,630 --> 01:31:36,820
"The gods are many and the gods have been

2205

"at war for as long as we exist.

2206
01:31:38,650 --> 01:31:41,920
"There are some that believe we are nothing but

2207

"the aftermath of their squabbles.

2208
01:31:45,020 --> 01:31:47,480
"But nevertheless, there is much good

2211

"you are lost amongst this chaos,

01:31:54,660 --> 01:31:57,140
"don't ever be afraid to stop in

01:31:57,140 --> 01:31:58,780
"and ask a few questions."

2214
01:31:59,300 --> 01:32:02,260
VAX: I was just wondering if I could ask you

2215
01:32:02,260 --> 01:32:04,680
to ask them, to maybe help.

2216
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:06,520
I would never think to ask the gods for help

2217
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:10,640
if I wanted a shiny new sword or pile of riches,

2218
01:32:10,640 --> 01:32:12,330
but this is something different.

2219
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:15,980
GROG: Unless they could get us a pile of riches.

2220
01:32:15,980 --> 01:32:17,070
VEX: Or a shining sword.

2221
01:32:17,070 --> 01:32:18,490
VAX: Good boy.

2222
01:32:18,490 --> 01:32:20,410
(all laugh)

2223
01:32:20,410 --> 01:32:23,020
MATT: At which point Kima laughs to herself.

2224
01:32:24,980 --> 01:32:28,800
KIMA: "There are benefits to being of the order."

2225
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:32,240
MATT: Kima who does not have an accent

2226
01:32:32,240 --> 01:32:33,260
and did not say it that way.

2227
01:32:36,540 --> 01:32:39,080
Too many NPCs in  my head right now. She says,

2228
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:42,190
KIMA: "But, understand.

2229
01:32:42,190 --> 01:32:44,820
"Whenever I felt lost, which was often.

2230
01:32:44,820 --> 01:32:49,040
"It's good to have that guiding warmth to turn to.

2231
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:53,780
"And sometimes it brings you into a subterranean mountain

2232
01:32:53,780 --> 01:32:55,450
"being tortured by dwarves.

2233
01:32:56,180 --> 01:32:59,140
"Sometimes it guides you to new friends and allies.

2234
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:00,560
"Strange the way the gods work.

2235
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:03,770
"But, when you put your all into it,

2236
01:33:03,770 --> 01:33:05,290
"they've kept me alive so far."

2237
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:08,640
PIKE: That's a really good point.

2238
01:33:08,640 --> 01:33:10,980
I guess that's a positive way to look at it.

2239
01:33:10,980 --> 01:33:13,550
KEYLETH: I really like long walks in the forest

2240
01:33:13,550 --> 01:33:15,370
when I'm feeling disconnected.

2241
01:33:16,020 --> 01:33:18,090
PIKE: That works too, you know.

2242
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:21,630
GROG: Lady Kima,

2243
01:33:21,630 --> 01:33:26,300
do the gods allow you to have relationships?

2244
01:33:28,290 --> 01:33:31,310
MATT: Kima, you ask this and she gives you

2245
01:33:31,310 --> 01:33:34,340
a look of confusion, and then…

2246
01:33:35,210 --> 01:33:38,220
She already a darker complexion for a halfling

2247
01:33:38,220 --> 01:33:42,140
but her cheeks grow noticeably ruddier.

2248
01:33:42,140 --> 01:33:44,140
She averts her gaze and says,

2249
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:48,060
KIMA: "Well..."

2250
01:33:48,060 --> 01:33:50,980
TRAVIS: I start trying to do my best Vax wink.

2251
01:33:50,980 --> 01:33:51,660
LAURA: I'm Vex.

2252
01:33:51,660 --> 01:33:52,690
TRAVIS: --Vex wink.

2253
01:33:52,690 --> 01:33:54,590
(all laugh)

2254
01:33:55,740 --> 01:33:57,200
MATT: She averts her gaze and goes,

2255
01:33:57,200 --> 01:34:01,540
KIMA: "Well, as far as I know

2256
01:34:02,810 --> 01:34:07,000
it is not a vow of chastity within the order."

2257
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,600
GROG: So you're saying there's a chance.

2258
01:34:11,210 --> 01:34:13,610
MATT: She still is looking away.

2259
01:34:13,610 --> 01:34:15,710
She looks away and looks to the rest of you.

2260
01:34:15,710 --> 01:34:19,480
Looks to Allura. Looks to you again. And then goes,

2261
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:21,210
KIMA: "I really have to get to work on this."

2262
01:34:21,210 --> 01:34:22,300
TALIESIN: You did this.
KIMA: "I really have to get to work on this."

2263
01:34:22,300 --> 01:34:25,660
MATT: She leaves the group and continues down the hallway.

2264
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:26,850
Quick steps.

2265
01:34:26,850 --> 01:34:28,060
PIKE: Bye, Kima!
Quick steps.

2266
01:34:28,380 --> 01:34:30,190
VAX: A lot of math involved in that equation.

2267
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:31,550
KEYLETH: Yeah...

2268
01:34:31,550 --> 01:34:32,860
MATT: Allura chuckles to herself

2269
01:34:32,860 --> 01:34:34,480
and steps into the place where she was and goes,

2270
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:35,650
TIBERIUS: I care not to solve the puzzle.

2271
01:34:36,060 --> 01:34:39,370
ALLURA: "Oh, as a note.

2272
01:34:42,360 --> 01:34:45,050
"Be careful who you ask those questions to,

2273
01:34:45,050 --> 01:34:46,830
"you may get an earful."

2274
01:34:46,830 --> 01:34:50,270
MATT: And Allura smiles and motions towards Kima.

2275
01:34:50,970 --> 01:34:51,610
ALLURA: "Don't get me wrong,

2276
01:34:51,610 --> 01:34:53,380
"you're more than welcome to explore as you like,

2277
01:34:53,380 --> 01:34:55,980
"but that's a rabbit hole my friend."

2278
01:34:57,410 --> 01:34:58,380
GROG: A rabbit hole,

2279
01:34:58,380 --> 01:35:00,930
is that what we're calling it these days?

2280
01:35:02,490 --> 01:35:04,570
MATT: You feel a gentle slap

2281
01:35:04,570 --> 01:35:07,770
from some unknown arcane force across your cheek Grog.

2282
01:35:08,540 --> 01:35:11,460
And Allura gives you a stern glare.

2283
01:35:11,460 --> 01:35:13,920
MARISHA: Oh, don't talk about her girl that way.

2284
01:35:15,550 --> 01:35:17,060
LIAM: Don't make me take my earrings off.

2285
01:35:17,740 --> 01:35:18,460
MATT: Anyway.

2286
01:35:20,110 --> 01:35:21,410
ALLURA: "So two days.

2287
01:35:21,410 --> 01:35:25,970
"We'll call for you when the item is to be transferred

2288
01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:29,330
"and properly brought to its destination.

2289
01:35:29,330 --> 01:35:31,130
"In the meantime, prepare as you see fit,

2290
01:35:31,130 --> 01:35:33,130
"enjoy this well-earned rest,

2291
01:35:33,130 --> 01:35:35,400
"and we'll take it from there.

2292
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:38,340
"I have much travel to do myself.

2293
01:35:38,340 --> 01:35:39,460
"See you all very soon."

2294
01:35:39,460 --> 01:35:41,870
MATT: She begins to step up the hallway.

2295
01:35:41,870 --> 01:35:43,290
As she steps up the hallway, you can see

2296
01:35:43,290 --> 01:35:47,100
there's a light yellowish glow about her form.

2297
01:35:47,100 --> 01:35:49,100
Then with a sudden flash of white light,

2298
01:35:49,100 --> 01:35:50,590
Allura's just gone.

2299
01:35:53,610 --> 01:35:57,500
KEYLETH: So guys. I'm thinking we take a local tour

2300
01:35:57,500 --> 01:36:00,300
of all the historical highlights of Emon.

2301
01:36:00,300 --> 01:36:02,660
We've never really gone sightseeing,

2302
01:36:02,660 --> 01:36:06,200
Then maybe we can catch a nice dinner in the city tonight.

2303
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:08,590
VEX: Oh, look at the time.

2304
01:36:08,590 --> 01:36:09,940
GROG: Oh, it's getting so late.

2305
01:36:10,670 --> 01:36:14,050
KEYLETH: It's 1pm.

2306
01:36:14,050 --> 01:36:15,160
We've got the whole day

2307
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:17,880
PERCY: It feels like eight. It really feels so late.

2308
01:36:17,880 --> 01:36:19,550
KEYLETH: I picked up one of these pamphlets

2309
01:36:19,550 --> 01:36:20,760
while we were in the palace

2310
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:24,780
and apparently there's a nice natural history museum.

2311
01:36:24,780 --> 01:36:25,870
PERCY: Gilmore's? Gilmore's?

2312
01:36:25,870 --> 01:36:28,930
TIBERIUS: Your highness, what is a pam-phlet?

2313
01:36:28,930 --> 01:36:30,110
PERCY: Gilmore's?

2314
01:36:30,110 --> 01:36:31,610
TIBERIUS: Oh, a lot of paper.

2315
01:36:31,610 --> 01:36:32,910
PERCY: I'll be at Gilmore's.

2316
01:36:32,910 --> 01:36:34,040
TIBERIUS: Oh, it's like a mini book!

2317
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:35,440
KEYLETH: It's like a tiny scroll.

2318
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:36,580
TIBERIUS: It has pictures!

2319
01:36:36,580 --> 01:36:37,200
KEYLETH: Yes!

2320
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:37,680
TIBERIUS: Look, Percy!

2321
01:36:38,130 --> 01:36:40,290
TALIESIN: I'm already heading towards Gilmore's.

2322
01:36:40,290 --> 01:36:41,520
LIAM: I'm following Percy.

2323
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:43,760
TRAVIS: We're going to Gilmore's, too.

2324
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:46,110
MATT: All right. You guys exit and find your way,

2325
01:36:46,110 --> 01:36:48,020
exiting the palace and the cloudtop district

2326
01:36:48,020 --> 01:36:49,880
to make your way to Abedar's Promenade

2327
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:53,310
to enter and reunite with your good friend Gilmore.

2328
01:36:53,700 --> 01:36:55,100
MATT: We're going to take this moment to take a break,

2329
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:56,850
use the restroom, get some food.

2330
01:36:56,850 --> 01:36:59,330
TALIESIN: We're at two? Are we at two more?

2331
01:36:59,330 --> 01:37:00,640
ZAC: Giveaway time!

2332
01:37:00,640 --> 01:37:01,740
MATT: Oh, it's giveaway time.

2333
01:37:01,740 --> 01:37:03,170
(Background: Snuggle Lord, Snuggle Lord)
All right, we hit our next giveaway so we'll do that first.

2334
01:37:03,170 --> 01:37:03,980
All right, we hit our next giveaway so we'll do that first.

2335
01:37:04,260 --> 01:37:05,860
(Background: Snuggle Lord, Snuggle Lord)
All right, so we have --

2336
01:37:05,860 --> 01:37:06,580
MATT: Oh no.

2337
01:37:08,510 --> 01:37:09,470
MARISHA: Snuggle Lord?!

2338
01:37:10,810 --> 01:37:12,660
MARISHA: It's a Snuggle Lord variant!

2339
01:37:15,020 --> 01:37:16,830
TALIESIN: Snuggle Lord, Snuggle Lord.

2340
01:37:18,220 --> 01:37:19,480
LIAM: There he is.

2341
01:37:20,140 --> 01:37:21,490
(all cheer)

2342
01:37:21,490 --> 01:37:23,290
MARISHA: Snuggle Lord has returned!

2343
01:37:25,100 --> 01:37:27,610
MATT: There you go, there is Snuggle Lord in his glory.
MARISHA: No, not the horns of Orcus!

2344
01:37:27,610 --> 01:37:29,340
ORION: No, now he has the power!

2345
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:32,050
(all laugh)

2346
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:33,890
ZAC: We hit our second giveaway.

2347
01:37:33,890 --> 01:37:36,820
(all cheer)

2348
01:37:38,360 --> 01:37:39,790
ZAC: We're going to give one of these away.

2349
01:37:40,650 --> 01:37:43,860
All you have to do is be active in the chat room, guys.

2350
01:37:44,450 --> 01:37:47,000
So, if you're watching full screen,

2351
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,320
get out of full screen, be active.

2352
01:37:50,100 --> 01:37:51,420
She can't see it, can she?

2353
01:37:51,420 --> 01:37:52,770
MATT: No, she can see it though.

2354
01:37:52,770 --> 01:37:53,940
MARISHA: Can't see.

2355
01:37:53,940 --> 01:37:56,210
MARISHA: Can you see it? Gotta tilt it down a bit.

2356
01:37:56,210 --> 01:37:57,330
LAURA: There we go, it's so cute.

2357
01:38:01,700 --> 01:38:03,650
ZAC: All right guys be active in the chat room.

2358
01:38:03,650 --> 01:38:04,810
We're going to let these guys take a break.

2359
01:38:04,810 --> 01:38:06,450
When we come back from the break, we'll announce the winner.

2360
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:09,400
MARISHA: Do we have a word?

2361
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:10,680
ZAC: Oh yeah, go for it.

2362
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:11,530
MARISHA: Here we'll use the word

2363
01:38:11,530 --> 01:38:13,230
KommissarProps in the chat room.

2364
01:38:13,230 --> 01:38:14,620
ZAC: I'll have to go set it up.

2365
01:38:14,620 --> 01:38:15,870
Okay, I gotta run.

2366
01:38:15,870 --> 01:38:17,310
MATT: Go set it up.

2367
01:38:17,310 --> 01:38:20,250
So hold that thought, until he starts it.

2368
01:38:20,250 --> 01:38:21,980
The word will be KommissarProps.

2369
01:38:21,980 --> 01:38:23,100
MARISHA: Say KommissarProps

2370
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:24,420
and definitely go follow Kai on Instagram and on Facebook

2371
01:38:24,420 --> 01:38:25,930
MATT: These horns will be yours.
and definitely go follow Kai on Instagram and on Facebook

2372
01:38:25,930 --> 01:38:27,060
and definitely go follow Kai on Instagram and on Facebook

2373
01:38:27,060 --> 01:38:29,810
because he was awesome enough to make these horns for us.

2374
01:38:30,580 --> 01:38:34,650
So Instagram and Facebook,

2375
01:38:34,650 --> 01:38:36,140
that's where all the pretty pictures are.

2376
01:38:36,140 --> 01:38:38,190
MATT: You yourself can be corrupted by the evil of Orcus.

2377
01:38:38,190 --> 01:38:40,990
MARISHA: You yourself can be corrupted if you go and find him.

2378
01:38:40,990 --> 01:38:42,440
TALIESIN: Watch him while he sleeps.

2379
01:38:43,060 --> 01:38:44,340
MATT: You and RhymesWithOrange can be

2380
01:38:44,340 --> 01:38:46,340
the two keepers of the two horns of Orcus

2381
01:38:46,340 --> 01:38:48,620
and bring ruin to the entire world of Exandria.

2382
01:38:48,620 --> 01:38:49,550
So that could be you.

2383
01:38:49,550 --> 01:38:51,150
Anyway, we're taking a break. We'll see you guys back here

2384
01:38:51,150 --> 01:38:52,220
in a little over ten minutes

2385
01:38:52,220 --> 01:38:55,300
and we'll continue as they head towards…

2386
01:38:55,300 --> 01:38:56,800
Gilmore's Glorious Goods.

2387
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:57,480
TALIESIN: Gilmore's!

2388
01:38:57,480 --> 01:39:00,200
MATT: All right, I gotta prepare. See you soon guys.

2389
01:54:38,920 --> 01:54:40,840
MATT: Hey guys, welcome back.

2390
01:54:40,840 --> 01:54:44,600
We’re about to get in some game time again here in a second,

2391
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:48,670
but first we have our second winner to win the second

2392
01:54:48,670 --> 01:54:51,870
horn of Orcus for the evening’s giveaway.

2393
01:54:51,870 --> 01:54:53,970
We’re really excited to announce the winner of the

2394
01:54:53,970 --> 01:54:56,330
second player’s handbook signed by the group,

2395
01:54:56,330 --> 01:54:58,970
the dice kit, as well as this horn,

2396
01:54:58,970 --> 01:55:00,770
is Ember72.

2397
01:55:00,770 --> 01:55:03,160
MATT: Ember72, congratulations.

2398
01:55:03,160 --> 01:55:05,420
TRAVIS: Ember72!
MATT: You get to have this one.

2399
01:55:05,420 --> 01:55:07,780
It’s awesome, really stoked.

2400
01:55:07,780 --> 01:55:09,690
We now have both of these horns given away.

2401
01:55:09,690 --> 01:55:10,880
And while these are the only

2402
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:12,810
horns of Orcus that’ll be out there,

2403
01:55:12,810 --> 01:55:15,200
our fantastic propmaster over here,

2404
01:55:15,200 --> 01:55:17,130
Kai, Kommissar Props,

2405
01:55:17,130 --> 01:55:19,180
will be working with us in the future to do more

2406
01:55:19,180 --> 01:55:20,860
Critical Role-based prop giveaways.

2407
01:55:20,860 --> 01:55:22,860
And once again, definitely check out his work,

2408
01:55:22,860 --> 01:55:24,580
he’s an amazing fabricator and propmaster.

2409
01:55:24,580 --> 01:55:25,880
ASHLEY: Those are the only two?
he’s an amazing fabricator and propmaster.

2410
01:55:25,880 --> 01:55:27,650
MATT: These are the only two that’re gonna go out.

2411
01:55:27,650 --> 01:55:28,180
TALIESIN: They’re the only two in the world.

2412
01:55:28,180 --> 01:55:29,550
ASHLEY: That’s really special.
TALIESIN: They’re the only two in the world.

2413
01:55:29,800 --> 01:55:33,100
ZAC: At 3600 we’ll do the starter kit, t-shirt --

2414
01:55:33,100 --> 01:55:34,880
ASHLEY: That sounded insincere, but I really meant it.

2415
01:55:34,880 --> 01:55:35,640
MATT: Yeah.

2416
01:55:35,640 --> 01:55:36,960
TRAVIS: That did sound insincere.

2417
01:55:38,260 --> 01:55:40,010
MATT: We’ll see somewhere down the road.

2418
01:55:40,010 --> 01:55:41,360
If we want to put out more stuff, we’ll see.

2419
01:55:41,360 --> 01:55:44,600
But right now these are just an exclusive giveaway.

2420
01:55:44,600 --> 01:55:46,420
Excited for those two guys. So everyone once again

2421
01:55:46,420 --> 01:55:48,090
for Rhymeswithorange and Ember72,

2422
01:55:48,090 --> 01:55:49,050
congratulations on those bits.

2423
01:55:49,050 --> 01:55:51,230
MARISHA: Or maybe if you follow Kommissar Props,

2424
01:55:51,230 --> 01:55:53,950
we’ll do another giveaway to the people who follow him.

2425
01:55:53,950 --> 01:55:57,380
MATT: Helping friends out because they do awesome work.

2426
01:55:58,400 --> 01:56:00,930
Congratulations on that. If we can get to 3600

2427
01:56:00,930 --> 01:56:02,540
we’re gonna be doing some dance after the show,

2428
01:56:02,540 --> 01:56:04,490
so hopefully we can hit that subscriber number tonight.

2429
01:56:04,490 --> 01:56:05,210
ZAC: Plus giveaway.

2430
01:56:05,210 --> 01:56:05,810
MATT: Plus giveaway.

2431
01:56:05,810 --> 01:56:08,930
Plus the signed t-shirt, the dice box, starter kit, so.

2432
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:13,310
MATT: Good stuff. All right, bringing us back to the game.

2433
01:56:13,610 --> 01:56:14,720
ASHLEY: Gilmore!

2434
01:56:15,010 --> 01:56:15,980
MATT: So you guys,

2435
01:56:15,980 --> 01:56:18,820
you make your way outside of the Castletop District

2436
01:56:18,820 --> 01:56:21,320
into the center of Emon proper.

2437
01:56:21,320 --> 01:56:22,840
Returning to Abedar’s Promenade,

2438
01:56:22,840 --> 01:56:26,650
which is the largest central section of the city,

2439
01:56:26,650 --> 01:56:30,320
where most of the merchantile itself seems to have

2440
01:56:30,320 --> 01:56:32,810
gathered and been a serious conglomerate

2441
01:56:32,810 --> 01:56:34,570
where all business in this city happens.

2442
01:56:35,700 --> 01:56:38,330
Those who would like a quick little visual

2443
01:56:38,330 --> 01:56:40,330
idea of the city, this is Emon.

2444
01:56:40,650 --> 01:56:42,260
MATT: Right there. It’s a small little --

2445
01:56:42,260 --> 01:56:46,920
--there is an amazing printout of this that they’ve,

2446
01:56:46,920 --> 01:56:48,920
actually Laura and Travis, have framed

2447
01:56:48,920 --> 01:56:52,090
and put up in their room sometime. We’ll have to go ahead

2448
01:56:52,090 --> 01:56:53,070
and bring on the show and show you guys.

2449
01:56:53,070 --> 01:56:55,440
LAURA: We’re gonna bring it to put on the set.

2450
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:56,090
At some point.

2451
01:56:56,090 --> 01:56:58,040
MATT: Yeah, we’ll have it too. Anyway,

2452
01:56:58,040 --> 01:57:00,280
the Castletop District is here, the inner portion.

2453
01:57:00,280 --> 01:57:01,890
You guys have made your way out south

2454
01:57:01,890 --> 01:57:03,890
to the Central District

2455
01:57:03,890 --> 01:57:06,100
and then towards Abedar’s Promenade,

2456
01:57:06,100 --> 01:57:08,980
which is right over here.

2457
01:57:08,980 --> 01:57:10,360
So you guys would’ve gone this way, actually.

2458
01:57:10,360 --> 01:57:11,890
So you’re out to Abedar’s Promenade in the far

2459
01:57:11,890 --> 01:57:14,860
eastern side of Emon, where you

2460
01:57:14,860 --> 01:57:16,600
eventually find your way to the outskirts

2461
01:57:16,600 --> 01:57:20,210
of your favorite purveyor of arcane mystical artifacts.

2462
01:57:20,210 --> 01:57:21,650
MARISHA: Gilmore!

2463
01:57:21,650 --> 01:57:23,650
MATT: Shaun Gilmore himself.

2464
01:57:23,650 --> 01:57:24,940
MARISHA: Shaun Gilmore.

2465
01:57:25,320 --> 01:57:26,220
MATT: So as you guys --

2466
01:57:26,220 --> 01:57:27,170
ASHLEY: Is that his first name?

2467
01:57:27,170 --> 01:57:28,740
MARISHA: I didn’t know Shaun was his first name either.

2468
01:57:28,740 --> 01:57:29,220
MATT: Yeah.
MARISHA: I didn’t know Shaun was his first name either.

2469
01:57:29,220 --> 01:57:30,140
TALIESIN: You’ve not been paying attention.

2470
01:57:30,140 --> 01:57:31,710
MATT: Shaun Gilmore, but you’ve always called him Gilmore.

2471
01:57:31,710 --> 01:57:33,710
MARISHA: We’re on a first-name basis now, guys.

2472
01:57:33,710 --> 01:57:36,180
MATT: No one’s on a first-name basis with Gilmore.

2473
01:57:36,180 --> 01:57:36,670
MARISHA: We are.

2474
01:57:36,670 --> 01:57:37,630
MATT: Gilmore is Gilmore.

2475
01:57:37,630 --> 01:57:39,150
MARISHA: Except for maybe Vax over there.

2476
01:57:39,150 --> 01:57:40,500
MATT: Except for maybe, maybe Vax.

2477
01:57:40,890 --> 01:57:42,440
MATT: So at this point now

2478
01:57:42,440 --> 01:57:44,530
you’re pushing about two in the afternoon.

2479
01:57:44,530 --> 01:57:46,030
It’s extremely busy, you can hear the

2480
01:57:46,030 --> 01:57:48,910
clopping of horse hooves on the ground,

2481
01:57:48,910 --> 01:57:50,110
people are walking past.

2482
01:57:50,110 --> 01:57:52,290
You’d swear as you’re stepping through the city,

2483
01:57:52,290 --> 01:57:54,430
maybe a handful of people tend to stop

2484
01:57:54,430 --> 01:57:57,310
and watch you guys walk through, stunned.

2485
01:57:57,310 --> 01:57:59,770
Almost like they’d seen a celebrity on the street,

2486
01:57:59,770 --> 01:58:02,650
as the most recent makeup of the Winter’s Crest festival

2487
01:58:02,650 --> 01:58:05,740
was a celebration of you being the heroes

2488
01:58:05,740 --> 01:58:08,610
who saved the city of Emon and the sovereign and his family.

2489
01:58:09,450 --> 01:58:12,560
Apparently you are now recognizable within the city of Emon.

2490
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:13,340
LIAM: My sister winks.

2491
01:58:13,340 --> 01:58:14,350
TRAVIS: Yeah we are.

2492
01:58:16,240 --> 01:58:19,220
MATT: All right, so Vax wills Vex to wink.

2493
01:58:19,220 --> 01:58:21,130
Vex, do you accept this wink from your brother?

2494
01:58:21,130 --> 01:58:21,870
LAURA: I do.

2495
01:58:21,870 --> 01:58:22,430
MATT: All right.

2496
01:58:22,430 --> 01:58:23,120
LAURA: Other way.

2497
01:58:23,120 --> 01:58:24,380
MATT: Perfect, there you go.

2498
01:58:24,380 --> 01:58:25,320
LAURA: Just a little more.

2499
01:58:26,240 --> 01:58:28,490
MATT: Perfect. We’ve lined it up.

2500
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:30,880
As you walk across the main thoroughfare,

2501
01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:35,470
you make your way to the wide but single-story building

2502
01:58:35,470 --> 01:58:37,930
that is Gilmore’s Glorious Goods.

2503
01:58:37,930 --> 01:58:41,960
Of all the various shades of brown and red and brick

2504
01:58:41,960 --> 01:58:42,920
that makes up all these buildings,

2505
01:58:42,920 --> 01:58:46,180
Gilmore’s Glorious Goods is presented in

2506
01:58:46,180 --> 01:58:50,360
fine, deep blue and purple fabric and a paint scheme

2507
01:58:50,360 --> 01:58:52,610
that would look like the worst funhouse to enter.

2508
01:58:52,610 --> 01:58:55,460
Worst or best, depending on your opinion.

2509
01:58:55,460 --> 01:59:00,350
The entranceway is not a door but a series of hanging beads and

2510
01:59:00,350 --> 01:59:03,400
large cloth drapes that are gently falling

2511
01:59:03,400 --> 01:59:05,420
to be brushed aside as you enter.

2512
01:59:06,840 --> 01:59:10,900
It’s not as big as you remember, or recall, seemingly.

2513
01:59:10,900 --> 01:59:13,710
But as you step through the front door you remember why.

2514
01:59:13,710 --> 01:59:14,890
Much like the TARDIS,

2515
01:59:14,890 --> 01:59:18,080
the interior of Gilmore’s Goods is bigger on the inside.

2516
01:59:18,080 --> 01:59:21,060
There is a magical enchantment based within this building

2517
01:59:21,060 --> 01:59:23,230
where the interior is actually a two-story

2518
01:59:23,230 --> 01:59:25,780
and much larger place of business.

2519
01:59:26,270 --> 01:59:30,520
Immediately the smells of incense and

2520
01:59:30,520 --> 01:59:32,940
fine perfumes assault your nose --

2521
01:59:32,940 --> 01:59:34,190
GROG: Ugh!
fine perfumes assault your nose --

2522
01:59:34,190 --> 01:59:36,510
MATT: Like a terrible medieval Sephora.

2523
01:59:36,510 --> 01:59:37,320
VAX: Like coming home.

2524
01:59:37,320 --> 01:59:38,730
ASHLEY: Medieval Sephora.

2525
01:59:43,800 --> 01:59:46,840
MATT: A series of magically flickering ever-burning candles

2526
01:59:46,840 --> 01:59:49,150
adorn sconces along the walls.

2527
01:59:49,150 --> 01:59:50,700
You can see there are glass cases

2528
01:59:50,700 --> 01:59:52,190
set out in the center of the room,

2529
01:59:52,190 --> 01:59:54,020
there is the long wooden bar on the far end

2530
01:59:54,020 --> 01:59:56,380
which has itself its own beaded curtain that is closed,

2531
01:59:56,380 --> 01:59:59,370
and there are three employees of Gilmore’s Glorious Goods in their

2532
01:59:59,370 --> 02:00:02,520
ceremonial blue and purple robes that match the exterior,

2533
02:00:03,730 --> 02:00:06,510
staring about while there a number of other

2534
02:00:06,510 --> 02:00:08,510
possible customers that are looking about.

2535
02:00:08,510 --> 02:00:11,730
There are numerous bookshelves along the walls.

2536
02:00:11,730 --> 02:00:13,180
You can see there is,

2537
02:00:13,180 --> 02:00:16,970
next to the stairway on the far left side of this floor,

2538
02:00:16,970 --> 02:00:18,650
there is an herbalist who specializes

2539
02:00:18,650 --> 02:00:20,400
in dried herbs and sales in that regard.

2540
02:00:21,060 --> 02:00:23,760
You haven't been to the upstairs yet in this complex.

2541
02:00:23,760 --> 02:00:26,420
But you now are standing back in the comfortable,

2542
02:00:26,420 --> 02:00:31,680
although slightly offensive to your senses,

2543
02:00:31,680 --> 02:00:33,560
interior of Gilmore's Glorious Goods.

2544
02:00:33,560 --> 02:00:35,640
LIAM: I'm scanning the entire store for him.

2545
02:00:35,640 --> 02:00:36,340
I want to find him.

2546
02:00:36,340 --> 02:00:37,440
MATT: He's not currently visible.

2547
02:00:37,440 --> 02:00:39,490
LIAM: Oh! He's not here?

2548
02:00:39,490 --> 02:00:41,390
MATT: He's not visible. Not in the main room.

2549
02:00:42,130 --> 02:00:43,060
LIAM: All right.

2550
02:00:43,380 --> 02:00:43,780
ASHLEY: He has his private office.

2551
02:00:43,780 --> 02:00:44,510
VEX: Brother.
ASHLEY: He has his private office.

2552
02:00:44,510 --> 02:00:45,520
VAX: Yes?

2553
02:00:45,940 --> 02:00:49,200
VEX: You should get that evil Clarota helmet checked out

2554
02:00:49,200 --> 02:00:50,840
and see what all good it does us.

2555
02:00:50,840 --> 02:00:51,600
VAX: What, this one?

2556
02:00:52,970 --> 02:00:53,760
VEX: Yep. That one.

2557
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:54,350
VAX: Yes.

2558
02:00:56,460 --> 02:00:57,420
KEYLETH: Vax.

2559
02:00:57,420 --> 02:00:57,970
VAX: Yes?

2560
02:00:57,970 --> 02:00:59,840
KEYLETH: I say you'd be the point man here.

2561
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:00,580
VAX: I think so.

2562
02:01:00,580 --> 02:01:01,410
TIBERIUS: I would agree.

2563
02:01:01,410 --> 02:01:02,580
PIKE: I think that's a really good plan.

2564
02:01:02,580 --> 02:01:06,030
PERCY: I second that notion. Quintuple it.

2565
02:01:06,030 --> 02:01:07,790
KEYLETH: Yeah. The twinsies should go.

2566
02:01:07,790 --> 02:01:09,610
VAX: Start looking around. Start shopping.

2567
02:01:09,610 --> 02:01:12,910
Don't pay for anything yet, because I have an arrangement.

2568
02:01:12,910 --> 02:01:14,000
PIKE: He can get a little discount.

2569
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:15,290
VEX: He can get a little

2570
02:01:15,290 --> 02:01:17,720
wink, wink, nudge, nudge discount.

2571
02:01:18,160 --> 02:01:20,440
MARISHA: I go up to Vax.

2572
02:01:20,440 --> 02:01:23,100
I put my hands on his shoulders, and I say,

2573
02:01:24,450 --> 02:01:25,330
KEYLETH: You got this.

2574
02:01:25,330 --> 02:01:28,080
MARISHA: And I cast Enhance Ability on him.

2575
02:01:28,080 --> 02:01:29,130
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2576
02:01:29,130 --> 02:01:32,030
MARISHA: For charisma? I'm assuming?

2577
02:01:32,030 --> 02:01:34,910
LIAM: Let's make my hair even glossier than it already is.

2578
02:01:34,910 --> 02:01:37,120
MARISHA:  And I give him a little bit of the dad thumb.

2579
02:01:38,810 --> 02:01:39,530
LIAM: I know that thumb.

2580
02:01:39,530 --> 02:01:40,010
MARISHA: Yeah.

2581
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:41,310
TRAVIS: The dad thumb?

2582
02:01:42,180 --> 02:01:43,370
MARISHA: Wipe the morning breakfast off of him

2583
02:01:43,370 --> 02:01:45,660
before I send him on to school.

2584
02:01:46,430 --> 02:01:47,010
MATT: (laughs quietly)

2585
02:01:47,010 --> 02:01:48,700
MARISHA: And I give him a little love tap

2586
02:01:48,700 --> 02:01:51,150
on his behind and send him on his way.

2587
02:01:51,150 --> 02:01:51,950
ASHLEY: Send him on his merry way.

2588
02:01:51,950 --> 02:01:52,840
MATT: All right.

2589
02:01:52,840 --> 02:01:54,000
TALIESIN: Shoulder massage.

2590
02:01:55,240 --> 02:01:57,310
MATT: All righty. So?

2591
02:01:57,610 --> 02:01:59,200
MARISHA: So you have advantage rolls on all charisma rolls.

2592
02:01:59,200 --> 02:02:00,130
LIAM: Is there a front desk?

2593
02:02:00,130 --> 02:02:01,330
ORION: (package crinkling)
LIAM: Is there a front desk?

2594
02:02:01,330 --> 02:02:04,400
MATT: On the far back side, there is a very long,

2595
02:02:04,400 --> 02:02:07,120
well-crafted dark wood desk that is adorned

2596
02:02:07,120 --> 02:02:08,620
with what looks like small alchemical components,

2597
02:02:08,620 --> 02:02:10,260
(package crinkling)
with what looks like small alchemical components,

2598
02:02:10,260 --> 02:02:11,740
glass tubing and --
(package crinkling)

2599
02:02:12,330 --> 02:02:14,080
Be a little louder with those Red Vines.

2600
02:02:14,080 --> 02:02:15,690
ORION: Sorry. Do you want one?

2601
02:02:15,690 --> 02:02:16,720
MATT: I'm good, thank you.

2602
02:02:18,900 --> 02:02:20,280
ASHLEY: (laughs)

2603
02:02:20,280 --> 02:02:21,610
MATT: We're good.

2604
02:02:22,920 --> 02:02:25,360
You can see there are a number of glass containers

2605
02:02:25,360 --> 02:02:29,290
and small corked vials --

2606
02:02:29,290 --> 02:02:32,740
LIAM: I'm sorry, he's looking for Gilmore.

2607
02:02:32,740 --> 02:02:34,510
MARISHA: (laughs)

2608
02:02:34,510 --> 02:02:36,270
LIAM: They're going to flirt together.

2609
02:02:36,270 --> 02:02:37,410
MATT: (laughs)

2610
02:02:37,410 --> 02:02:38,940
TIBERIUS: It's like watching a movie.

2611
02:02:38,940 --> 02:02:40,940
MARISHA: (giggles)

2612
02:02:41,860 --> 02:02:42,400
LIAM: Sorry.

2613
02:02:42,400 --> 02:02:44,660
MATT: It's all right. There are some books stacked up.

2614
02:02:44,660 --> 02:02:48,730
There is a small, embedded glass case

2615
02:02:48,730 --> 02:02:50,780
that seems to have a couple of items that are under

2616
02:02:50,780 --> 02:02:53,620
a purplish-maroon, velvet piece of material

2617
02:02:53,620 --> 02:02:55,370
that's currently covering them.

2618
02:02:55,370 --> 02:02:58,330
There is that beaded curtain with strips of material

2619
02:02:58,330 --> 02:02:59,730
that block the back room.

2620
02:03:01,160 --> 02:03:03,080
LIAM: Okay, and there's a person manning the --

2621
02:03:03,080 --> 02:03:05,080
MATT: No, not currently. It is just an empty desk.

2622
02:03:05,080 --> 02:03:06,410
LIAM: Is there a bell or anything?

2623
02:03:06,410 --> 02:03:07,240
MATT: There is a bell.

2624
02:03:07,240 --> 02:03:08,500
LIAM: Yeah.

2625
02:03:10,050 --> 02:03:12,480
MATT: As you hit the bell, one of the employees

2626
02:03:12,480 --> 02:03:13,700
who is helping somebody looks around and goes,

2627
02:03:14,930 --> 02:03:16,090
EMPLOYEE: "I'm sorry."

2628
02:03:16,090 --> 02:03:17,600
MATT: What you see is

2629
02:03:17,600 --> 02:03:21,010
a half-elven woman with thick spectacles

2630
02:03:21,010 --> 02:03:22,780
who is currently stepping over to try and stop you.

2631
02:03:22,780 --> 02:03:25,220
However, the beaded curtain swishes open

2632
02:03:25,220 --> 02:03:29,840
with the grandiose gesture of one slightly meaty hand.

2633
02:03:29,840 --> 02:03:34,980
Stepping out in his fine, gold-trimmed, purple robes,

2634
02:03:34,980 --> 02:03:39,470
his longish thick, black, coarse hair

2635
02:03:39,470 --> 02:03:41,240
pulled into a nice ponytail.

2636
02:03:42,270 --> 02:03:46,620
Smoothly-shaved face with a slight hint of a braided goatee

2637
02:03:46,620 --> 02:03:48,570
that dangles about three inches from his chin.

2638
02:03:48,570 --> 02:03:51,410
LIAM: Will you remind me because it's been a while.

2639
02:03:51,410 --> 02:03:53,220
Gilmore's a good-looking man, though, isn't he?

2640
02:03:53,220 --> 02:03:54,160
MATT: Yeah. He's handsome.

2641
02:03:54,160 --> 02:03:54,650
LIAM: Yeah.

2642
02:03:54,650 --> 02:03:56,980
MARISHA: Is the braid new? Is that a new addition?

2643
02:03:56,980 --> 02:03:58,040
LAURA: He's so handsome, Vax.

2644
02:03:58,040 --> 02:04:01,450
MARISHA: The braid's new. He decided to rock the braid.

2645
02:04:02,410 --> 02:04:03,450
Go for it!

2646
02:04:03,450 --> 02:04:05,220
MATT: Gilmore's a very handsome gentleman.

2647
02:04:06,900 --> 02:04:10,910
I would say he's not fit and muscular.

2648
02:04:10,910 --> 02:04:14,340
He is a handsome, comfortably jovial gentleman.

2649
02:04:14,340 --> 02:04:16,650
LIAM: I'm picturing Jeremy Irons in a wizard robe.

2650
02:04:17,080 --> 02:04:19,130
MATT: Kind of. Imagine him with a little more paunch.

2651
02:04:19,130 --> 02:04:19,560
LIAM: Okay.

2652
02:04:20,240 --> 02:04:22,400
MATT: But very charismatic.

2653
02:04:23,290 --> 02:04:25,810
Open chest to his vest, with a number of gold chains

2654
02:04:25,810 --> 02:04:28,270
and medallions that dangle around.

2655
02:04:28,270 --> 02:04:28,890
LIAM: I feel you.

2656
02:04:28,890 --> 02:04:31,400
MATT: It's almost like a wizard's track suit.

2657
02:04:32,010 --> 02:04:34,600
(all laugh)

2658
02:04:34,600 --> 02:04:36,740
LIAM: You ruined it for me, man!

2659
02:04:37,620 --> 02:04:38,680
TALIESIN: And it's dead.

2660
02:04:39,850 --> 02:04:42,650
MARISHA: Please tell me it says "arcane" on the butt?

2661
02:04:42,650 --> 02:04:43,160
MATT: No.

2662
02:04:43,160 --> 02:04:45,000
(all laugh)

2663
02:04:46,610 --> 02:04:47,890
MATT: He's very well-dressed,

2664
02:04:47,890 --> 02:04:49,800
but his presentation is definitely a presentation.

2665
02:04:49,800 --> 02:04:51,890
As the hand swishes open, he goes,

2666
02:04:51,890 --> 02:04:53,890
GILMORE: "I'm sorry, was I being summoned?"

2667
02:04:55,170 --> 02:04:55,890
ORION: Yes.

2668
02:04:55,890 --> 02:04:57,890
MATT: He immediately looks and goes,

2669
02:04:58,640 --> 02:05:00,500
GILMORE: "Oh. You've returned."

2670
02:05:00,500 --> 02:05:04,840
VAX: Gilmore, you glorious bastard. How have you been?

2671
02:05:04,840 --> 02:05:06,840
MATT: He immediately rushes to the edge and

2672
02:05:06,840 --> 02:05:09,490
leans over the counter to give you a grandiose hug

2673
02:05:09,490 --> 02:05:11,370
and actually lifts you off your feet.

2674
02:05:11,370 --> 02:05:13,370
Much stronger than you anticipated. He goes,

2675
02:05:13,370 --> 02:05:16,860
GILMORE: "Oh, Vax'ahlia. It's been far too long."

2676
02:05:16,860 --> 02:05:19,160
MATT: He sets you down next to him behind the counter

2677
02:05:19,160 --> 02:05:23,220
and gives you a big hug, his strong wizard arms around you.

2678
02:05:24,060 --> 02:05:28,300
A scent of what's almost like fine herbs

2679
02:05:28,300 --> 02:05:30,450
with a hint of patchouli enters your nose.

2680
02:05:30,450 --> 02:05:31,010
TALIESIN: (laughs)

2681
02:05:31,010 --> 02:05:33,010
VAX: You naughty man.

2682
02:05:33,010 --> 02:05:35,220
You just called me by my sister's name.

2683
02:05:35,220 --> 02:05:36,810
That is going to cost you.

2684
02:05:36,810 --> 02:05:37,500
MARISHA: (gasps)

2685
02:05:37,500 --> 02:05:41,100
GILMORE: "I said Vax! What do you mean?

2686
02:05:41,100 --> 02:05:43,060
VAX: I heard "Vex'ahlia."
That's ridiculous. Preposterous."

2687
02:05:43,060 --> 02:05:44,930
Can we go to the videotape? Anyone?

2688
02:05:45,920 --> 02:05:46,700
MARISHA: Instant replay!

2689
02:05:46,700 --> 02:05:48,700
TIBERIUS: Actually, Vax, he was correct.

2690
02:05:48,700 --> 02:05:49,690
He said your name correctly.

2691
02:05:49,690 --> 02:05:50,880
I believe you owe him a little something now.

2692
02:05:50,880 --> 02:05:53,970
KEYLETH: I think it was a little bit of combination.

2693
02:05:53,970 --> 02:05:56,140
A little bit of column A, a little bit of column B.

2694
02:05:56,140 --> 02:05:58,140
I think he called you Vex'ahlia.

2695
02:05:58,140 --> 02:05:59,080
VAX: Water under the bridge.

2696
02:05:59,080 --> 02:06:01,100
KEYLETH: Or Vax'ahlia, is what he called you.

2697
02:06:01,100 --> 02:06:03,640
TIBERIUS: He called you Vax'ahlia, which I call you in my sleep.

2698
02:06:03,640 --> 02:06:04,530
VAX: Shut up, you.

2699
02:06:05,570 --> 02:06:06,330
LIAM: I lean in.

2700
02:06:06,330 --> 02:06:10,260
MATT: He looks genuinely perturbed and embarrassed

2701
02:06:10,260 --> 02:06:11,240
by the whole circumstance.

2702
02:06:11,860 --> 02:06:13,140
GILMORE: "I --"

2703
02:06:13,140 --> 02:06:14,930
LIAM: I lean in. I pat him on the hand.

2704
02:06:15,460 --> 02:06:20,560
VAX: Don't you worry. We have come from far and away.

2705
02:06:20,560 --> 02:06:23,280
You would not believe the shit we have been through,

2706
02:06:23,280 --> 02:06:24,720
but I don't want to talk about me.

2707
02:06:24,720 --> 02:06:25,680
I want to talk about you.

2708
02:06:25,680 --> 02:06:28,210
What has been going on in this city since we've been gone?

2709
02:06:28,210 --> 02:06:28,990
GILMORE: "Well."

2710
02:06:28,990 --> 02:06:30,890
MATT: And he looks about the rest of you and says,

2711
02:06:30,890 --> 02:06:33,050
GILMORE: "Obviously you've brought the rest of your friends here.

2712
02:06:33,050 --> 02:06:34,920
"Come, sit! Story time, story time!"

2713
02:06:34,920 --> 02:06:35,960
(all laugh)

2714
02:06:35,960 --> 02:06:36,890
GILMORE: "Please sit around."

2715
02:06:37,730 --> 02:06:39,070
TIBERIUS: Fantastic.

2716
02:06:40,670 --> 02:06:44,570
GILMORE: "We have been doing marvelously.

2717
02:06:44,570 --> 02:06:46,690
"Trade has opened up wide in Emon.

2718
02:06:46,690 --> 02:06:49,740
"We've had travelers from all over Tal'Dorei and beyond.

2719
02:06:50,560 --> 02:06:51,870
"It's incredible."

2720
02:06:52,330 --> 02:06:53,740
(all giggle)

2721
02:06:54,730 --> 02:06:57,080
GILMORE: "I'm in the process of planning an expansion

2722
02:06:57,080 --> 02:06:58,620
"to another town. Perhaps even --"

2723
02:06:58,620 --> 02:06:59,380
VEX: Oh, my.

2724
02:06:59,380 --> 02:07:06,190
GILMORE: "--perhaps even opening a second store in Westruun."

2725
02:07:06,190 --> 02:07:08,960
KEYLETH: You're going to own a chain?

2726
02:07:09,470 --> 02:07:10,750
TIBERIUS: Congratulations!
GILMORE: "Perhaps."

2727
02:07:10,750 --> 02:07:12,750
TIBERIUS: This is a big step for any businessman.

2728
02:07:12,750 --> 02:07:14,600
PERCY: Spectacular.

2729
02:07:15,330 --> 02:07:16,980
GILMORE: "But yes. No, I have been able to take on

2730
02:07:16,980 --> 02:07:18,520
"two more arcanists.

2731
02:07:18,520 --> 02:07:20,260
"We've been in the process of

2732
02:07:20,260 --> 02:07:23,610
"designing some more interesting, wondrous items.

2733
02:07:24,280 --> 02:07:27,970
"We have stocked many of our recent

2734
02:07:28,320 --> 02:07:30,190
"possible and available items.

2735
02:07:30,190 --> 02:07:32,800
"We are doing quite well for ourselves."

2736
02:07:32,800 --> 02:07:35,220
TIBERIUS: Are you looking for investors, Gilmore?

2737
02:07:38,810 --> 02:07:42,530
GILMORE: "I technically am your investor, in a way."

2738
02:07:42,530 --> 02:07:43,050
TIBERIUS: Oh.

2739
02:07:43,050 --> 02:07:43,960
VEX: He is.

2740
02:07:43,960 --> 02:07:46,030
KEYLETH: True, we are sponsored by him.

2741
02:07:46,030 --> 02:07:47,650
GILMORE: "But. If you have the money in which

2742
02:07:47,650 --> 02:07:50,770
"to sponsor our business, that's a whole other discussion."

2743
02:07:52,520 --> 02:07:54,670
TIBERIUS: I just wanted you to talk to me for a little bit.

2744
02:07:55,580 --> 02:07:56,300
Vax, take it away.

2745
02:07:56,300 --> 02:07:58,730
GILMORE: "Dragonborn.

2746
02:07:58,730 --> 02:08:00,510
"But yes! How about yourselves?

2747
02:08:00,510 --> 02:08:02,860
"You look like you've --"

2748
02:08:02,860 --> 02:08:04,740
MATT: He gives you all a look over.

2749
02:08:05,310 --> 02:08:07,530
GILMORE: "--like you've maybe not slept in a fortnight."

2750
02:08:07,530 --> 02:08:10,420
VAX: Well. We're lucky we're not dead.

2751
02:08:10,420 --> 02:08:12,420
It came close a couple of times.

2752
02:08:12,830 --> 02:08:15,700
We were off on official business for the emperor.

2753
02:08:15,700 --> 02:08:18,130
We've been underground for weeks and weeks.

2754
02:08:18,130 --> 02:08:20,280
We've only seen the sun for a couple of days.

2755
02:08:20,500 --> 02:08:22,010
GILMORE: "Oh. That kind of a weekend.

2756
02:08:22,010 --> 02:08:22,940
"I know how that goes."

2757
02:08:22,940 --> 02:08:28,720
VAX: Needless to say, our stores are terribly depleted.

2758
02:08:28,720 --> 02:08:31,460
We are going to need to stock up a bit

2759
02:08:31,460 --> 02:08:33,100
before we head out of town again.

2760
02:08:33,100 --> 02:08:34,460
I don't want to rush things, though.

2761
02:08:34,460 --> 02:08:38,100
I think my friends probably want to shop about.

2762
02:08:38,100 --> 02:08:40,910
My sister can probably handle things for me.

2763
02:08:40,910 --> 02:08:43,940
I would love to take a stroll with you around the city.

2764
02:08:45,580 --> 02:08:47,000
Get a bit of lunch, a bite,

2765
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,640
and hear about what's been happening.

2766
02:08:49,640 --> 02:08:51,360
Hear the rumors of town.

2767
02:08:51,900 --> 02:08:55,870
We all know nobody matches your shrewdness in business.

2768
02:08:55,870 --> 02:08:56,920
That's no surprise.

2769
02:08:56,920 --> 02:08:57,900
GILMORE: (chuckles)

2770
02:08:57,900 --> 02:08:59,570
VAX: But I'm wondering what you've heard.

2771
02:08:59,570 --> 02:09:01,550
What's on the wind?

2772
02:09:02,280 --> 02:09:03,610
Can you take the afternoon off?

2773
02:09:05,500 --> 02:09:07,710
MATT: He looks over at the same half-elven woman

2774
02:09:07,710 --> 02:09:08,850
who was trying to stop you earlier.

2775
02:09:08,850 --> 02:09:11,970
She gives a look like, 'what's he going to say?'

2776
02:09:11,970 --> 02:09:13,820
No one's ever asked him this question. He goes,

2777
02:09:14,650 --> 02:09:16,810
GILMORE: "For you? Of course."

2778
02:09:16,810 --> 02:09:19,260
(all laugh)

2779
02:09:19,260 --> 02:09:21,230
MARISHA: Man date. Go for it!

2780
02:09:21,230 --> 02:09:22,200
VEX: Don't worry, Gilmore.

2781
02:09:22,200 --> 02:09:24,600
We'll take wonderful care of your employees.

2782
02:09:25,320 --> 02:09:26,820
GILMORE: "Well if you wish to do business,

2783
02:09:26,820 --> 02:09:27,880
"why not do that now?"

2784
02:09:28,960 --> 02:09:31,170
VEX: We need to shop around first, of course.

2785
02:09:31,170 --> 02:09:32,720
GILMORE: "Very well."

2786
02:09:32,720 --> 02:09:33,740
PERCY: And we're so curious

2787
02:09:33,740 --> 02:09:36,300
as to any of these interesting and fascinating things

2788
02:09:36,300 --> 02:09:38,260
that you've developed in the several weeks

2789
02:09:38,260 --> 02:09:39,700
it's been since we've been here.

2790
02:09:39,700 --> 02:09:41,340
We'd love to see what you've been working on.

2791
02:09:41,340 --> 02:09:43,140
GILMORE: "Very well. Sherri!"

2792
02:09:43,140 --> 02:09:45,860
MATT: The same woman, her shoulders droop.

2793
02:09:46,350 --> 02:09:48,670
SHERRI: "Yes, Gilmore?"

2794
02:09:49,160 --> 02:09:51,330
(all laugh)

2795
02:09:51,330 --> 02:09:52,750
GILMORE: "Would you be so kind as to see to

2796
02:09:52,750 --> 02:09:54,580
"whatever our friends need?

2797
02:09:54,580 --> 02:09:56,200
"These are Vox Machina, by the way.

2798
02:09:56,560 --> 02:09:59,450
"They are currently sponsored by Gilmore's Glorious Goods, Inc,

2799
02:09:59,450 --> 02:10:01,950
"and I would very much like to make sure

2800
02:10:01,950 --> 02:10:03,560
"that they are taken care of."

2801
02:10:05,020 --> 02:10:07,760
SHERRI: "Yes, sir. I'll make sure that happens."

2802
02:10:09,560 --> 02:10:10,600
MATT AND TALIESIN: (laugh)

2803
02:10:10,600 --> 02:10:12,250
GILMORE: "So. Shall we?"

2804
02:10:12,250 --> 02:10:14,320
VAX: I think this will take a while. Let's.

2805
02:10:15,280 --> 02:10:16,750
VEX: Have a wonderful time, brother.

2806
02:10:16,750 --> 02:10:18,460
LIAM: I look to my sister as we go.

2807
02:10:20,280 --> 02:10:22,860
VAX: Just get what I need, will you?

2808
02:10:23,300 --> 02:10:23,800
VEX: Of course.

2809
02:10:23,800 --> 02:10:24,690
VAX: Thank you.

2810
02:10:24,690 --> 02:10:26,160
LIAM: And stroll out the door with Gilmore.

2811
02:10:26,160 --> 02:10:27,940
Have at it, ladies and gentlemen.

2812
02:10:27,940 --> 02:10:28,940
TRAVIS: Yes!

2813
02:10:28,940 --> 02:10:30,900
MARISHA: We'll leave dinner on the stove for you.

2814
02:10:31,710 --> 02:10:33,880
MATT: So Sherri looks at the rest of you

2815
02:10:33,880 --> 02:10:34,940
as they leave and goes,

2816
02:10:37,690 --> 02:10:39,970
SHERRI: "So you're all friends of Gilmore, then?"

2817
02:10:41,090 --> 02:10:41,860
KEYLETH: Yes.

2818
02:10:44,200 --> 02:10:45,620
PIKE: Business friends.

2819
02:10:46,210 --> 02:10:47,200
SHERRI: Business friends. All right.

2820
02:10:47,200 --> 02:10:50,300
KEYLETH: We're mutual fans of one another, if you will.

2821
02:10:50,300 --> 02:10:51,840
MATT: She adjusts her glasses.

2822
02:10:52,530 --> 02:10:55,050
SHERRI: "Then let's continue with the business.

2823
02:10:55,420 --> 02:10:57,140
"What are you seeking? What do you need?

2824
02:10:57,140 --> 02:10:58,300
"What are you looking for?"

2825
02:10:58,300 --> 02:11:00,300
TIBERIUS: I don't know. We like all kinds of things.

2826
02:11:00,300 --> 02:11:01,900
KEYLETH: Well, we definitely need potions.

2827
02:11:01,900 --> 02:11:03,080
SHERRI: "Potions. Those we can provide."

2828
02:11:03,080 --> 02:11:03,890
KEYLETH: Health potions.

2829
02:11:03,890 --> 02:11:04,660
SHERRI: "Health potions, yes.

2830
02:11:04,660 --> 02:11:06,880
"Potions of healing can be provided."

2831
02:11:06,880 --> 02:11:07,880
KEYLETH: What do you have right now?

2832
02:11:08,350 --> 02:11:10,380
MATT: She goes behind the counter for a second

2833
02:11:10,380 --> 02:11:12,000
and ruffles through some stuff.

2834
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:13,390
Goes in the back room and comes back out

2835
02:11:13,390 --> 02:11:15,260
with a wooden crate, pretty much.

2836
02:11:15,260 --> 02:11:17,090
You hear the glass jangling inside as she moves it

2837
02:11:17,090 --> 02:11:19,090
and sets it on the counter with a ting.

2838
02:11:19,090 --> 02:11:21,250
They all eventually come to rest. She goes,

2839
02:11:21,250 --> 02:11:23,380
SHERRI: "All right, looking through here, it looks like we have

2840
02:11:23,380 --> 02:11:25,640
"about 12 regular potions of healing.

2841
02:11:26,220 --> 02:11:28,290
"We have six of greater healing.

2842
02:11:29,020 --> 02:11:31,950
"And it looks like three of superior healing."

2843
02:11:33,850 --> 02:11:33,890
PIKE: What's the price on the superior healing, again?

2844
02:11:33,890 --> 02:11:34,850
TIBERIUS: We'll take the lot.
PIKE: What's the price on the superior healing, again?

2845
02:11:34,850 --> 02:11:35,890
PIKE: What's the price on the superior healing, again?

2846
02:11:35,890 --> 02:11:36,690
SHERRI: "Superior healing?

2847
02:11:36,690 --> 02:11:40,770
"Let's see, currently those go for about --"

2848
02:11:42,030 --> 02:11:43,980
MATT: She looks at the price book, going through.

2849
02:11:44,360 --> 02:11:45,300
SHERRI: "Those will run you --"

2850
02:11:45,300 --> 02:11:47,080
MATT: As I go through my price book.

2851
02:11:49,610 --> 02:11:50,770
PIKE: We are sponsored.

2852
02:11:51,630 --> 02:11:53,890
PERCY: We do keep getting turned to stone.

2853
02:11:53,890 --> 02:11:55,770
This has been a problem, and it's

2854
02:11:55,770 --> 02:11:56,660
been sticking around a bit.

2855
02:11:56,660 --> 02:11:58,980
I feel like we should maybe take some precautions

2856
02:11:58,980 --> 02:12:01,480
for the inevitable next time this happens.

2857
02:12:02,690 --> 02:12:06,300
SHERRI: "That will be 1500 gold pieces per superior."

2858
02:12:07,090 --> 02:12:10,140
KEYLETH: Is that with our sponsorship prices?

2859
02:12:10,650 --> 02:12:12,440
SHERRI: "Right, you mentioned you're sponsored.

2860
02:12:12,440 --> 02:12:14,530
"That would be a 10% discount.

2861
02:12:14,530 --> 02:12:17,180
"That would bring it to about 1350,

2862
02:12:18,160 --> 02:12:20,740
"should you wish to purchase them individually."

2863
02:12:20,740 --> 02:12:21,580
PIKE: Okay.

2864
02:12:21,820 --> 02:12:23,740
GROG: I definitely need one of those.

2865
02:12:23,740 --> 02:12:26,670
VEX: Wait. How much if we're purchasing them individually?

2866
02:12:26,960 --> 02:12:30,530
SHERRI: "1350 gold pieces per superior healing potion."

2867
02:12:30,530 --> 02:12:31,340
TIBERIUS: How much for the lot?

2868
02:12:31,340 --> 02:12:35,490
VEX: And if we buy in bulk, what can you bring it down to?

2869
02:12:35,490 --> 02:12:36,650
SHERRI: "If you buy all three?"

2870
02:12:38,830 --> 02:12:40,160
VEX: A thousand each?

2871
02:12:42,110 --> 02:12:43,520
SHERRI: "I'm sorry.

2872
02:12:43,520 --> 02:12:46,380
"You've already been given the discount via Gilmore.

2873
02:12:47,540 --> 02:12:49,330
"That price stands as it is.

2874
02:12:49,330 --> 02:12:52,410
"Let's say you buy the three remaining items,

2875
02:12:52,410 --> 02:12:56,540
"I'll give you 1200 apiece.

2876
02:12:56,540 --> 02:12:58,610
"And even that I'll probably get in trouble for,

2877
02:12:58,610 --> 02:12:59,840
"but he seems to like you."

2878
02:13:01,210 --> 02:13:03,900
VEX: 1200 apiece? Yes?

2879
02:13:03,900 --> 02:13:04,940
GROG: We'll take that.

2880
02:13:04,940 --> 02:13:05,410
PERCY: Sounds good.

2881
02:13:05,410 --> 02:13:06,020
VEX: Three superior.

2882
02:13:06,020 --> 02:13:06,970
SHERRI: "Very well.

2883
02:13:07,810 --> 02:13:10,300
"So 3600 gold pieces.

2884
02:13:10,300 --> 02:13:11,880
"Three superior are yours."

2885
02:13:11,880 --> 02:13:13,090
MATT: She pulls them out of the crate

2886
02:13:13,090 --> 02:13:13,820
and slides them across.

2887
02:13:13,820 --> 02:13:17,320
They are thick, very heavily-made glass vials with these

2888
02:13:17,320 --> 02:13:18,760
small glass handles on the side.

2889
02:13:18,760 --> 02:13:20,270
You can see the interior.

2890
02:13:20,270 --> 02:13:24,360
The liquid itself is a reddish purple, almost blood color,

2891
02:13:24,360 --> 02:13:26,820
but there's a gold sheen as you shake it in the light.

2892
02:13:26,820 --> 02:13:30,140
You can see there's a spark of divine glow to it.

2893
02:13:30,140 --> 02:13:31,040
MARISHA: Like Goldschlager.

2894
02:13:31,040 --> 02:13:31,530
TALIESIN: Classy.

2895
02:13:31,530 --> 02:13:34,650
MATT: Kind of. It's the worst of healing Goldschlager.

2896
02:13:34,650 --> 02:13:36,010
MARISHA: (laughs)

2897
02:13:37,490 --> 02:13:38,900
SHERRI: "Is that all you require?"

2898
02:13:41,640 --> 02:13:44,270
GROG: Do you sell any love potions?

2899
02:13:44,970 --> 02:13:47,050
MATT: She gives you the blank stare and goes,

2900
02:13:47,900 --> 02:13:48,500
SHERRI: "No."

2901
02:13:48,500 --> 02:13:50,590
(all laugh)

2902
02:13:51,020 --> 02:13:53,800
GROG: Right. Sorry for asking. Jeez.

2903
02:13:54,210 --> 02:13:57,310
PERCY: I would also say we should take the

2904
02:13:57,310 --> 02:13:59,500
six superior healing potions, as well.

2905
02:13:59,500 --> 02:14:00,500
TIBERIUS: Absolutely.

2906
02:14:01,200 --> 02:14:01,800
SHERRI: "The greater ones."

2907
02:14:01,800 --> 02:14:02,490
PERCY: Greater.

2908
02:14:02,490 --> 02:14:05,220
VEX: What did we just buy? We didn't buy superior?

2909
02:14:05,220 --> 02:14:06,220
PERCY: We bought the three superior.

2910
02:14:06,220 --> 02:14:07,710
We should also get the six greater.

2911
02:14:08,580 --> 02:14:10,520
VEX: Six greater. All right. How much is that?

2912
02:14:10,520 --> 02:14:12,170
SHERRI: "Those are 500 apiece.

2913
02:14:12,720 --> 02:14:16,720
"With your discount, that would be 450 apiece."

2914
02:14:17,640 --> 02:14:19,050
VEX: But if we're buying all six,

2915
02:14:19,050 --> 02:14:21,380
400 apiece is a very good price.

2916
02:14:22,840 --> 02:14:24,840
ORION: Now, this is the Vex I miss.
MATT: Roll a persuasion check.

2917
02:14:24,840 --> 02:14:26,810
MARISHA, ORION, AND TALIESIN:  Persuasion check,

2918
02:14:26,810 --> 02:14:27,640
persuasion check!

2919
02:14:27,640 --> 02:14:30,010
LIAM: Vex hasn't had a chance to haggle

2920
02:14:30,010 --> 02:14:31,290
since the show started.

2921
02:14:31,290 --> 02:14:32,190
MARISHA: Yep.

2922
02:14:32,190 --> 02:14:34,990
LIAM: All she used to do before this show was haggle.

2923
02:14:34,990 --> 02:14:37,320
MARISHA: We used to take food breaks.

2924
02:14:41,650 --> 02:14:42,830
MARISHA: No!

2925
02:14:43,130 --> 02:14:44,180
LAURA: Fourteen.

2926
02:14:44,510 --> 02:14:45,320
MATT: Fourteen? She goes,

2927
02:14:47,960 --> 02:14:52,770
SHERRI: "Let's call it an even 425 gold pieces each."

2928
02:14:52,770 --> 02:14:55,580
VEX: I like this. I'm comfortable with that.

2929
02:14:55,580 --> 02:14:56,360
SHERRI: "All right."

2930
02:14:56,360 --> 02:14:57,540
TALIESIN: 425 times 6...

2931
02:14:57,540 --> 02:14:58,900
MATT: She brings out her arcane calculator.

2932
02:14:59,470 --> 02:15:01,160
MARISHA: Her arcane calculator?

2933
02:15:03,450 --> 02:15:04,350
Once again, our charity.

2934
02:15:04,350 --> 02:15:06,650
SHERRI: "That’ll be 2550 gold pieces."

2935
02:15:06,770 --> 02:15:07,470
LAURA: All right.

2936
02:15:07,470 --> 02:15:09,690
MATT: And she pulls out the six that are there

2937
02:15:09,690 --> 02:15:11,220
and she kinda slides them over the counter to you.

2938
02:15:11,660 --> 02:15:14,050
One tips over but she catches it,

2939
02:15:14,050 --> 02:15:15,460
leaves it there at the far end.

2940
02:15:15,460 --> 02:15:17,310
GROG: Careful with those.

2941
02:15:17,310 --> 02:15:19,440
SHERRI: "They’re fine, they can take a beating,

2942
02:15:19,440 --> 02:15:20,320
"they’re designed that way."

2943
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:22,090
GROG: So can I.

2944
02:15:22,650 --> 02:15:23,780
MATT: She pushes her glasses up

2945
02:15:23,780 --> 02:15:26,450
and looks vastly unimpressed at the presentation.

2946
02:15:28,570 --> 02:15:30,490
VEX: How much were the superiors again?

2947
02:15:31,020 --> 02:15:32,830
SHERRI: "The superiors were 1500

2948
02:15:32,830 --> 02:15:34,930
"brought down to 1200 apiece, yes."

2949
02:15:34,930 --> 02:15:37,780
VEX: 1200. Which came to 36?

2950
02:15:37,780 --> 02:15:38,460
PERCY: Thirty-six.

2951
02:15:39,580 --> 02:15:40,920
PERCY: So do you have anything,

2952
02:15:40,920 --> 02:15:42,140
we keep getting turned into stone,

2953
02:15:42,140 --> 02:15:43,700
it’s been sort of a running theme.

2954
02:15:43,980 --> 02:15:46,400
We were hoping you might have something

2955
02:15:46,760 --> 02:15:49,330
to help alleviate stone skin or any --

2956
02:15:50,620 --> 02:15:53,730
SHERRI: "We do have potions of petrification removal."

2957
02:15:53,730 --> 02:15:55,480
PERCY: Yes! Petrification removal.

2958
02:15:55,480 --> 02:15:56,890
SHERRI: I think. Let me check.

2959
02:15:56,890 --> 02:15:58,290
MATT: And she goes in the back room,

2960
02:15:58,290 --> 02:15:59,490
rummages around for a minute,

2961
02:15:59,490 --> 02:16:01,140
comes out and she presents two of them.

2962
02:16:02,010 --> 02:16:06,510
They have a clear liquid that looks almost like dirty water,

2963
02:16:07,180 --> 02:16:08,610
and they’re like thin little vials, she goes,

2964
02:16:08,610 --> 02:16:12,690
SHERRI: "These potions, when applied to the flesh, will,

2965
02:16:12,690 --> 02:16:14,560
"more of an oil I guess you would say,

2966
02:16:14,560 --> 02:16:16,750
"removes the affliction of petrification.

2967
02:16:17,530 --> 02:16:20,530
"These do cost 750 gold apiece."

2968
02:16:21,810 --> 02:16:24,380
VEX: We have greater restoration from Pike,

2969
02:16:24,380 --> 02:16:26,640
and she can cure --

2970
02:16:26,640 --> 02:16:27,410
SHERRI: "Then you’re fine."

2971
02:16:27,410 --> 02:16:27,890
MATT: And she takes them --

2972
02:16:27,890 --> 02:16:29,460
TIBERIUS: How many potions are there?

2973
02:16:29,460 --> 02:16:29,780
SHERRI: "Two."

2974
02:16:29,780 --> 02:16:30,430
LIAM: But in the heat of the moment.

2975
02:16:30,430 --> 02:16:30,900
TIBERIUS: Get them.

2976
02:16:30,900 --> 02:16:31,530
PERCY: In the heat of the moment,

2977
02:16:31,530 --> 02:16:33,530
it might come quite in handy.

2978
02:16:33,530 --> 02:16:35,530
LIAM: A stone Grog in the middle of a fight?

2979
02:16:35,530 --> 02:16:36,440
GROG: I agree.

2980
02:16:36,440 --> 02:16:38,030
TIBERIUS: It takes her a day to learn that

2981
02:16:38,030 --> 02:16:39,770
and she can only do it like once or twice at the most.

2982
02:16:39,770 --> 02:16:41,770
GROG: I think we need to get it.

2983
02:16:41,770 --> 02:16:46,080
PERCY: I’d rather have the potions than the gold, to be fair.

2984
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:46,940
KEYLETH: Let’s just get one.

2985
02:16:46,940 --> 02:16:48,810
PERCY: And we haven’t discussed our discount.

2986
02:16:48,810 --> 02:16:50,100
KEYLETH: I should learn how to make potions.

2987
02:16:50,100 --> 02:16:51,310
I should learn this.

2988
02:16:52,210 --> 02:16:53,930
LIAM: Money is meant for spending.

2989
02:16:54,400 --> 02:16:55,760
VEX: Do we want to take one?

2990
02:16:55,760 --> 02:16:56,360
TIBERIUS: Take both.

2991
02:16:56,360 --> 02:16:58,360
PERCY: I’d actually say we take both.

2992
02:16:58,360 --> 02:16:59,150
LIAM: Not that I’m here.

2993
02:16:59,150 --> 02:17:02,300
VEX: Take both. 750 was not the discounted price.

2994
02:17:02,300 --> 02:17:02,980
TIBERIUS: No.

2995
02:17:03,410 --> 02:17:05,880
MATT: She gives you another look of like, ugh.

2996
02:17:05,880 --> 02:17:06,980
She adjusts her glasses.

2997
02:17:06,980 --> 02:17:09,320
TIBERIUS: To be fair, we are spending a lot, right?

2998
02:17:09,700 --> 02:17:10,330
Overall, so.

2999
02:17:10,330 --> 02:17:11,060
PIKE: Overall.

3000
02:17:12,520 --> 02:17:15,020
SHERRI: "That would come to 1350."

3001
02:17:15,640 --> 02:17:16,980
PERCY: Thirteen fifty.

3002
02:17:19,490 --> 02:17:20,930
GROG: We’ll take it.

3003
02:17:22,410 --> 02:17:25,980
VEX: 1300. Remember, we’re very good friends of Gilmore’s,

3004
02:17:25,980 --> 02:17:27,120
he said to treat us well.

3005
02:17:27,120 --> 02:17:28,340
MATT: Make another persuasion roll.

3006
02:17:31,800 --> 02:17:33,310
This is my new fan dice.

3007
02:17:33,310 --> 02:17:33,520
MATT: It’s awesome, thank you.

3008
02:17:33,520 --> 02:17:35,260
LAURA: That was really good.
MATT: It’s awesome, thank you.

3009
02:17:36,490 --> 02:17:38,290
LAURA: That would be 21.

3010
02:17:40,370 --> 02:17:41,300
MATT: It’s a good thing.

3011
02:17:42,170 --> 02:17:42,900
She gives you a look and goes,

3012
02:17:44,810 --> 02:17:46,000
SHERRI: "I don’t like you."

3013
02:17:46,190 --> 02:17:50,400
(all laugh)

3014
02:17:50,400 --> 02:17:52,280
SHERRI: "Thirteen hundred."

3015
02:17:53,170 --> 02:17:55,820
VEX: Thirteen hundred, lovely, thank you.

3016
02:17:56,340 --> 02:17:57,980
KEYLETH: Sherri? It was Sherri, right?

3017
02:17:57,980 --> 02:17:58,940
SHERRI: "Yes?"

3018
02:17:59,310 --> 02:18:03,740
KEYLETH: Do you have any books on how to learn

3019
02:18:03,740 --> 02:18:06,320
how to start making your own potions?

3020
02:18:06,320 --> 02:18:09,520
Or do you know of any classes in town

3021
02:18:09,520 --> 02:18:13,310
where maybe I could sign up for like a potion workshop?

3022
02:18:13,310 --> 02:18:15,250
SHERRI: "Nothing here, but that’s not a bad idea,

3023
02:18:15,250 --> 02:18:17,250
"might run that past Gilmore."

3024
02:18:18,240 --> 02:18:19,490
PERCY: You should offer a workshop.

3025
02:18:19,490 --> 02:18:19,860
KEYLETH: You should absolutely offer a workshop.

3026
02:18:19,860 --> 02:18:21,200
SHERRI: "That’s a good idea,
KEYLETH: You should absolutely offer a workshop.

3027
02:18:21,200 --> 02:18:23,140
"otherwise the Lyceum would be the place to look."

3028
02:18:23,140 --> 02:18:23,980
KEYLETH: The Lyceum?

3029
02:18:23,980 --> 02:18:24,350
SHERRI: "Yes."

3030
02:18:24,350 --> 02:18:24,940
KEYLETH: Okay.

3031
02:18:25,220 --> 02:18:27,210
TIBERIUS: Do you have any potions of strength

3032
02:18:27,210 --> 02:18:29,210
or any ability potions?

3033
02:18:29,210 --> 02:18:31,010
MATT: She leaves for a second, then comes back and goes,

3034
02:18:31,010 --> 02:18:32,960
SHERRI: "No, I’m afraid those were all purchased.

3035
02:18:33,300 --> 02:18:35,880
"However, we may have more in a few weeks or so.

3036
02:18:35,880 --> 02:18:37,740
"They take some time to create

3037
02:18:37,740 --> 02:18:39,680
"and the ingredients are a little bit scarce.

3038
02:18:39,680 --> 02:18:40,730
"However, trade is opening, perhaps --"

3039
02:18:40,730 --> 02:18:41,870
KEYLETH: Someone purchased

3040
02:18:41,870 --> 02:18:43,950
all of your potion of strength potions?

3041
02:18:43,950 --> 02:18:44,560
SHERRI: "Yes."

3042
02:18:45,120 --> 02:18:47,120
KEYLETH: Oh. How many did you have?

3043
02:18:47,120 --> 02:18:49,160
SHERRI: "We had four, I believe.

3044
02:18:49,160 --> 02:18:51,220
"Varying giant strength types."

3045
02:18:51,220 --> 02:18:52,260
PIKE: One person did

3046
02:18:52,260 --> 02:18:53,920
or it was just a bunch of people just buying.

3047
02:18:53,920 --> 02:18:55,450
SHERRI: "It was a handful over the period of time."

3048
02:18:55,450 --> 02:18:56,170
KEYLETH: Oh.

3049
02:18:57,260 --> 02:18:59,580
ORION: I’m gonna hand her also a ticket,

3050
02:18:59,580 --> 02:19:02,300
a scroll of telescription and be like,

3051
02:19:02,300 --> 02:19:05,010
TIBERIUS: When it comes in, please write that it has

3052
02:19:05,010 --> 02:19:06,820
and I will be notified via this parchment.

3053
02:19:06,820 --> 02:19:07,390
SHERRI: "Very well."

3054
02:19:07,390 --> 02:19:08,050
MATT: She folds it

3055
02:19:08,050 --> 02:19:10,540
and places it in a little cubby on the side.

3056
02:19:10,540 --> 02:19:11,170
TIBERIUS: Thank you.

3057
02:19:11,520 --> 02:19:12,670
SHERRI: "Is there anything else you require?

3058
02:19:12,670 --> 02:19:15,120
"We have many magical,

3059

"various armaments and/or protective items."

3060
02:19:19,040 --> 02:19:22,020
GROG: Armaments, what kind of armaments you got?

3061
02:19:22,770 --> 02:19:24,130
SHERRI: "Well, if you’ll follow me."

3062
02:19:24,130 --> 02:19:28,000
MATT: She leads you up the stairway to the second floor.

3063
02:19:28,210 --> 02:19:31,090
The second floor itself is just a series of glass cases

3064
02:19:31,090 --> 02:19:32,410
that are leaned at an angle.

3065
02:19:32,410 --> 02:19:35,010
In these cases you can see there are different

3066
02:19:35,010 --> 02:19:37,790
items just laid out, small labels at the bottom with

3067
02:19:37,790 --> 02:19:39,360
GROG: Oh.
a brief description of the enchantment.

3068
02:19:39,800 --> 02:19:41,300
MATT: She leads you across, she goes,

3069
02:19:41,300 --> 02:19:44,170
SHERRI: "Well, first we’ll start here with the ring section."

3070
02:19:44,170 --> 02:19:46,100
MATT: You can see there’s a small case that has

3071
02:19:46,100 --> 02:19:48,440
along this purplish velvet pillow,

3072
02:19:48,440 --> 02:19:49,860
a bunch of different rings set out. She goes,

SHERRI: "We have varying degrees of rings of protection.

"the individual who wears,

"and one with one step higher above that."

3078
02:20:00,360 --> 02:20:02,300
MATT: The equivalent of a ring of protection +2.

SHERRI: "That ring runs 6500 gold.

"protect yourself from various mental intrusions.

"We have a ring of evasion

"Here --"

MATT: And she points over where there is

3102
02:21:09,320 --> 02:21:11,720
a thick leather belt with like three straps across

3103
02:21:11,720 --> 02:21:13,580
that looks highly well made with

3104
02:21:13,580 --> 02:21:16,340
what looks like square runic carvings on the side.

3105
02:21:16,730 --> 02:21:18,220
SHERRI: "--this is what is referred to,

"poison intrusion in one’s body,

"speaking, reading, and writing Dwarvish."

3119
02:21:49,940 --> 02:21:50,700
VEX: Oh wow.

3120
02:21:50,700 --> 02:21:51,810
KEYLETH: I need that.

3121
02:21:51,810 --> 02:21:52,660
MATT: It is 5000 gold.

3122
02:21:52,660 --> 02:21:53,950
VEX: I bet that’s very expensive...

3123
02:21:53,950 --> 02:21:55,060
LIAM: One month ago you needed that.

3124
02:21:55,400 --> 02:21:56,660
MARISHA: Yeah.

3125
02:21:58,010 --> 02:21:59,540
PIKE: What was the first ring?

3126
02:22:01,060 --> 02:22:02,650
GROG: Ring of protection.
SHERRI: "The first ring was the ring of protection."

3127
02:22:03,260 --> 02:22:04,380
MARISHA: Plus two, right?

3128
02:22:04,960 --> 02:22:07,620
MATT: It gives a plus two bonus to AC and saving throws.

3129
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:09,260
MARISHA: That’s really good.

3130
02:22:09,780 --> 02:22:11,420
PIKE: What was the evasion one?

3131
02:22:11,420 --> 02:22:13,310
SHERRI: "That one, that’s the ring of evasion."

3132
02:22:13,310 --> 02:22:14,510
PIKE: Yes, what was that?

3133
02:22:14,510 --> 02:22:15,610
MATT: It has three charges

3134
02:22:15,610 --> 02:22:17,610
and it regains 1d3 charges per day.

3135
02:22:18,010 --> 02:22:20,430
When you fail a dexterity saving throw while wearing it,

3136
02:22:20,430 --> 02:22:22,590
you can use your reaction to expend a charge

3137
02:22:22,590 --> 02:22:25,440
and auto-succeed on the saving throw instead.

3138
02:22:27,200 --> 02:22:28,760
Good for people who have low dexterity.

3139
02:22:31,140 --> 02:22:33,960
GROG: The one that protects you psychically,

3140
02:22:34,840 --> 02:22:37,700
could you repeat that one on the menu, please?

SHERRI: "The ring of psychic resistance --"

TALIESIN: Oh god.

3143
02:22:40,690 --> 02:22:42,280
MATT: It gives you resistance to psychic damage,

3144
02:22:42,280 --> 02:22:44,540
so anyone does damage that is psychic-based,

3145
02:22:44,540 --> 02:22:45,730
you take half damage.

3146
02:22:46,750 --> 02:22:47,900
VEX: That’s not quite it.

3147
02:22:47,900 --> 02:22:49,010
GROG: It’s not good?

3148
02:22:49,010 --> 02:22:50,620
VEX: No, it’s not quite the same.

3149
02:22:50,900 --> 02:22:52,210
GROG: Not even for me?

3150
02:22:53,060 --> 02:22:54,840
VEX: Do you have anything to make Grog smarter?

3151
02:22:54,840 --> 02:22:55,970
GROG: Well, fuck off.

3152
02:22:56,400 --> 02:22:59,260
(all laugh)

3153
02:23:02,130 --> 02:23:03,790
MATT: She looks over at him for a moment and goes,

3154
02:23:05,680 --> 02:23:08,640
SHERRI: No. No we don’t.

3155
02:23:08,640 --> 02:23:11,260
VEX: Any crayons so he could be occupied?

3156
02:23:12,460 --> 02:23:13,500
GROG: Do you have crayons?

3157
02:23:14,660 --> 02:23:16,040
SHERRI: "We have colored writing implements

3158
02:23:16,040 --> 02:23:17,330
"for children, if you’d like."

3159
02:23:18,320 --> 02:23:19,170
TIBERIUS: Yes, please.

3160
02:23:19,170 --> 02:23:21,560
GROG: I saw a few children in town.

3161
02:23:21,560 --> 02:23:22,880
Maybe they would like them.

3162
02:23:23,810 --> 02:23:26,190
MATT: She goes back downstairs and comes back in a moment.

3163
02:23:26,190 --> 02:23:28,740
She presents two small boxes that contain

3164
02:23:28,740 --> 02:23:31,710
small colored wax things. You can see on the outside

3165
02:23:31,710 --> 02:23:33,600
it has a picture of Gilmore, and he’s doing this,

3166
02:23:33,600 --> 02:23:35,640
and it says Gilmore’s Glorious Colored Sticks.

3167
02:23:36,090 --> 02:23:37,340
ORION: Of course.

3168
02:23:39,640 --> 02:23:42,380
SHERRI: "These are usually reserved for the children of

3169
02:23:43,200 --> 02:23:46,250
"our customers, so if the children will enjoy it, enjoy."

3170
02:23:46,250 --> 02:23:49,320
GROG: I’ll take one of those, please.

3171
02:23:49,320 --> 02:23:50,420
KEYLETH: Yes, trust me --

3172
02:23:50,420 --> 02:23:51,530
GROG: The colors are quite nice.

3173
02:23:51,530 --> 02:23:52,730
KEYLETH: --the children will.

3174
02:23:52,730 --> 02:23:54,270
SHERRI: "Five gold pieces apiece."

3175
02:23:55,240 --> 02:23:57,930
KEYLETH: Five gold pieces apiece? I thought they were free,

3176
02:23:57,930 --> 02:24:00,670
like when you go to an O’Charley’s or an Applebee’s.

3177
02:24:00,670 --> 02:24:02,140
SHERRI: "What’s an Applebee’s?"

3178
02:24:02,580 --> 02:24:03,720
TIBERIUS: It’s a hellhole,

3179
02:24:03,720 --> 02:24:05,980
apparently near where you used to live.

3180
02:24:05,980 --> 02:24:08,640
MATT: It’s one of the layers of the Abyss,

3181
02:24:08,640 --> 02:24:09,200
it’s like around --

3182
02:24:09,650 --> 02:24:11,330
KEYLETH: One of the infernal layers of the Abyss.

3183
02:24:11,330 --> 02:24:12,720
MATT: About layer 943.

3184
02:24:12,720 --> 02:24:14,530
KEYLETH: It’s getting pretty low, yeah.

3185
02:24:14,530 --> 02:24:17,780
PIKE: So I’ve been talking with Scanlan

3186
02:24:19,800 --> 02:24:24,590
and I know he was interested in the plus two AC ring.

3187
02:24:24,900 --> 02:24:27,140
KEYLETH: I think we should pick that up for sure.

3188
02:24:27,140 --> 02:24:28,320
PIKE: What’s the price on that?

3189
02:24:28,320 --> 02:24:30,960
SHERRI: "Sixty five hundredd gold pieces for that."

3190
02:24:30,960 --> 02:24:31,480
PIKE: Okay.

3191
02:24:31,480 --> 02:24:34,220
SHERRI: "With your discount, that would bring it --"

3192
02:24:34,220 --> 02:24:37,120
MATT: Goes back and looks again at her magic calculator,

3193
02:24:38,140 --> 02:24:38,700
I’m an actor not --

3194
02:24:38,700 --> 02:24:39,580
LIAM: It’s an abacus.

3195
02:24:39,580 --> 02:24:40,480
MATT: Exactly.

3196
02:24:41,330 --> 02:24:43,740
SHERRI: "That brings it to 5850."

3197
02:24:43,740 --> 02:24:49,330
PIKE: Well, he does have this amazing ruby gem.

3198
02:24:50,490 --> 02:24:54,900
He was maybe thinking of trading that

3199
02:24:54,900 --> 02:24:57,240
for maybe bringing down the price?

3200
02:24:58,300 --> 02:25:00,040
MATT: Do we know how much that was worth?

3201
02:25:01,220 --> 02:25:02,080
LIAM: Uh.

3202
02:25:02,080 --> 02:25:03,240
MATT: Has Scanlan looked at his sheet

3203
02:25:03,240 --> 02:25:04,700
and found what it’s worth?

3204
02:25:05,120 --> 02:25:06,110
VAX: Scanlan? Speak up,

3205
02:25:06,110 --> 02:25:07,450
PIKE: Scanlan,
VAX: Scanlan? Speak up,

3206
02:25:07,450 --> 02:25:09,330
VAX: Do you know how much it’s worth?

3207
02:25:09,330 --> 02:25:10,820
VAX: I think you wrote it down.

3208
02:25:12,190 --> 02:25:13,580
He’s talking quietly.

3209
02:25:13,580 --> 02:25:15,260
MATT: There was the diamond also that was

3210
02:25:15,260 --> 02:25:16,830
repaired in the mending wheel.

3211
02:25:18,200 --> 02:25:19,640
MATT: He can look that up as well.
MARISHA: There was a diamond.

3212
02:25:19,640 --> 02:25:20,520
VAX: Vex, do you remember

3213
02:25:20,520 --> 02:25:22,920
how much that diamond was worth, we got that diamond --

3214
02:25:23,370 --> 02:25:24,430
MATT: Oh no, we lost them.

3215
02:25:24,430 --> 02:25:25,320
TALIESIN: We lost them.

3216
02:25:25,320 --> 02:25:25,950
MARISHA: Oh no!

3217
02:25:25,950 --> 02:25:27,450
MATT: Redial, redial!

3218
02:25:28,580 --> 02:25:29,610
MARISHA: This is important!

3219
02:25:29,610 --> 02:25:30,130
LIAM: I got it.

3220
02:25:30,130 --> 02:25:31,800
MARISHA: How much is the diamond worth?

3221
02:25:32,590 --> 02:25:33,690
SHERRI: "Regardless.

3222
02:25:34,650 --> 02:25:35,970

LIAM: This is so period.

3226
02:25:41,710 --> 02:25:44,750
It’s just like Lord of the Rings. Beep beep beep.

3227
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:47,660
MATT: Magical sending stone.

3228
02:25:48,880 --> 02:25:50,100
LIAM: God damn it!

3229
02:25:50,380 --> 02:25:51,300
MARISHA: Answer!

3230
02:25:51,300 --> 02:25:52,250
MATT: Answer your Facetime.

3231
02:25:52,250 --> 02:25:53,410
MARISHA: Answer, bitches.

3232
02:25:53,860 --> 02:25:54,680
MATT: Vex!

3233
02:25:54,680 --> 02:25:56,120
ORION: I hate when you call and you know

3234
02:25:56,120 --> 02:25:57,640
that they’re there and they don’t pick up.

3235
02:25:57,640 --> 02:25:58,730
LIAM: All right, well I’m not here anyway,

3236
02:25:58,730 --> 02:26:00,600
so I’m just gonna keep doing this, as you were.

3237
02:26:00,600 --> 02:26:01,570
MATT: We’ll come to it.
so I’m just gonna keep doing this, as you were.

3238
02:26:01,570 --> 02:26:02,420
SHERRI: "Regardless."

3239
02:26:02,420 --> 02:26:03,790
MARISHA: We know you’re there!

3240
02:26:03,790 --> 02:26:05,290
MATT: She continues on, showing you through, she goes,

3241
02:26:05,290 --> 02:26:06,100
SHERRI: "Well, I don’t necessarily have anything

3242

"that would make him smarter.

02:26:08,380 --> 02:26:10,780
"We do have something that would make anyone quicker."

3244
02:26:10,780 --> 02:26:13,300
MATT: She goes a second, there is a big, thick leather tome.

3245
02:26:13,610 --> 02:26:15,840
SHERRI: "This is an ancient tome that was enchanted

3246
02:26:15,840 --> 02:26:18,570
"many, many generations back.

"one would increase their physical dexterity permanently."

02:26:25,500 --> 02:26:28,060
KEYLETH: Oh, I like that.

3250
02:26:28,060 --> 02:26:30,540
SHERRI: "It only has its abilities and power once a century,

3251
02:26:30,540 --> 02:26:33,020
"so it does come quite pricey."

3252
02:26:33,020 --> 02:26:34,740
KEYLETH: What is that price?

3253
02:26:34,960 --> 02:26:36,350
SHERRI: "Fifteen hundred gold pieces."

3254
02:26:38,780 --> 02:26:40,270
MARISHA: We should buy that.

3255
02:26:40,270 --> 02:26:41,930
ASHLEY: We should probably buy it.

3256
02:26:41,930 --> 02:26:43,760
KEYLETH: A tome that increases your dexterity plus one.

3257
02:26:43,760 --> 02:26:45,980
LAURA: It’s on my phone now. We switched.

3258
02:26:45,980 --> 02:26:46,860
MATT: That’s okay.

3259
02:26:49,160 --> 02:26:52,660
SHERRI: "So there is the manual of quickness of action,

MATT: And she produces this like --

(Facetime noises)
MATT: And she produces this like --

3263
02:26:58,250 --> 02:27:01,230
MATT: She produces this fine brass cap

3264
02:27:01,230 --> 02:27:05,330
that has intricate swirling runes on it and what looks like

3265
02:27:05,330 --> 02:27:08,450
a small set of ears that are pushed on the sides

3266
02:27:08,450 --> 02:27:09,630
so when it fits on the head it looks almost like a

3267
02:27:09,630 --> 02:27:12,660
smaller head on top of yours. She says,

3268

SHERRI: "This cap when worn, however,

"We also have --"

3271
02:27:18,590 --> 02:27:22,510
MATT: She pulls out this thick, leather armor that has a

3272
02:27:22,510 --> 02:27:24,940
brownish-blue trimmed hue to it and goes,

SHERRI: "This is what we refer to as coldsnap leather armor.

"While wearing it, you have resistance to cold damage."

3276
02:27:34,270 --> 02:27:35,240
KEYLETH: Is it leather armor, you said?

3277
02:27:35,240 --> 02:27:36,330
SHERRI: "Leather armor, yes."

3278
02:27:36,330 --> 02:27:37,230
KEYLETH: How much is that?

3279
02:27:37,230 --> 02:27:39,200
SHERRI: "That is 7500 gold pieces.

"It is a cape that when triggered --"

3282
02:27:46,930 --> 02:27:49,040
MATT: She takes it and shifts it for a second,

3283
02:27:49,040 --> 02:27:50,880
you can see a little bit of smoke plumes off of it,

3284
02:27:51,620 --> 02:27:52,380
smells sulfurish. She goes,

"We have this --"

3288
02:27:59,630 --> 02:28:01,370
MATT: She pulls another dark cloak off the wall.

3289
02:28:01,370 --> 02:28:04,480
This one looks like it’s made of dark fur,

3290
02:28:04,480 --> 02:28:06,410
but as she shakes it you can see these two little

3291
02:28:06,410 --> 02:28:09,130
tendrils are on it. They like wiggle about,

3292
02:28:09,130 --> 02:28:12,120
these little spiked edges to the tendrils.

SHERRI: "It is 4500 gold pieces."

02:28:31,120 --> 02:28:33,490
ORION: Oh, shit. She’s not here.

3304
02:28:33,490 --> 02:28:36,040
SHERRI: "I’ll put this aside as a possibility.

3305
02:28:37,490 --> 02:28:38,890
"We have a pearl of power."

3306
02:28:40,660 --> 02:28:42,460
MATT: She pulls up from this small box,

3307
02:28:42,460 --> 02:28:43,490
she opens up the top lid.

3308
02:28:43,490 --> 02:28:44,990
SHERRI: "This enchanted pearl,

3309
02:28:45,550 --> 02:28:48,530
"you can use it to speak a command word

3310
02:28:48,530 --> 02:28:50,830
"and regain one expended spell slot,

3311
02:28:50,830 --> 02:28:53,870
"up to third level, that you’ve already used.

3312
02:28:53,870 --> 02:28:54,770
"Once you’ve used the pearl,

3313
02:28:54,770 --> 02:28:56,050
"it can’t be used until the next dawn,

3314
02:28:56,050 --> 02:28:58,220
"so once per day you can just return.

3315
02:28:58,220 --> 02:28:59,560
"It’s for your caster-types."

3316
02:28:59,560 --> 02:29:00,760
KEYLETH: A third-level spell?

3317
02:29:00,760 --> 02:29:01,790
SHERRI: "Yes, up to third level,

3318
02:29:01,790 --> 02:29:03,450
"one spell slot, you can immediately restore it.

3319
02:29:05,120 --> 02:29:06,410
"It does require attunement, however,

3320
02:29:06,410 --> 02:29:08,190
"and you can’t have more than three items attuned to you,

3321
02:29:08,190 --> 02:29:09,710
"so be aware of your limitations."

3322
02:29:09,710 --> 02:29:10,750
PIKE: What’s the price on that one?

3323
02:29:10,750 --> 02:29:13,070
SHERRI: "This is 550 gold pieces."

3324
02:29:13,070 --> 02:29:13,570
PIKE: Okay.

3325
02:29:14,200 --> 02:29:17,920
TIBERIUS: Pike, do you have any 3rd-level healing spells?

3326
02:29:18,780 --> 02:29:20,970
PIKE: Do I have 3rd-level healing spells? I do.

3327
02:29:21,230 --> 02:29:24,340
SHERRI: "We’ll put it aside as a possibility. I also have --"

3328
02:29:24,720 --> 02:29:25,470
MATT: And you move to the side,

3329
02:29:25,470 --> 02:29:27,250
going through the armor section as well, she goes --

3330
02:29:27,250 --> 02:29:29,870
SHERRI: "I have a mithral chain shirt,

3331
02:29:29,870 --> 02:29:31,730
"as well as an enchanted mithral chain shirt,

3332
02:29:31,730 --> 02:29:33,730
"there is a plus one enchantment on it as well.

3333
02:29:33,730 --> 02:29:36,820
"They are flexible and can be worn under normal clothing,

3334
02:29:37,210 --> 02:29:39,780
"does not impose disadvantage on dexterity or stealth checks.

3335
02:29:41,060 --> 02:29:42,280
"It is considered light armor.

3336
02:29:44,220 --> 02:29:48,450
"There is golden chainmail, it’s a plus one enchantment."

3337
02:29:49,570 --> 02:29:52,760
MATT: Then she goes to what looks to be a series of weapons.

3338
02:29:54,810 --> 02:29:58,000
She brings forth a very fine-looking dagger, that has --

3339
02:29:58,000 --> 02:29:59,500
LIAM: Everyone hears from the back,

3340
02:29:59,500 --> 02:30:02,620
Scanlan’s voice piping up saying, "Just buy all this shit!"

3341
02:30:03,560 --> 02:30:04,760
MARISHA: Just buy all this shit.

3342
02:30:05,140 --> 02:30:05,720
ASHLEY: Buy everything.

3343
02:30:05,720 --> 02:30:07,720
MARISHA: How much money did we have?

3344
02:30:08,110 --> 02:30:09,090
Didn’t we have like at least --

3345
02:30:09,090 --> 02:30:11,480
LIAM: Thirty... thirty-ish. I mean, I’m not here, but --

3346
02:30:11,480 --> 02:30:12,450
MATT: And you still have money you haven’t

3347
02:30:12,450 --> 02:30:14,850
collected in Kraghammer, too.

3348
02:30:14,850 --> 02:30:15,390
MARISHA: Huh?

3349
02:30:15,390 --> 02:30:17,170
MATT: There’s money you still haven’t collected in Kraghammer.

3350
02:30:19,120 --> 02:30:20,940
Lord Nostoc Greyspine, you guys made a deal with him

3351
02:30:20,940 --> 02:30:22,440
before you went down in the pits.

3352
02:30:22,440 --> 02:30:23,710
LIAM: So maybe we could open up a line --

3353
02:30:23,710 --> 02:30:25,790
I’m sure you guys could open up a line of credit

3354
02:30:25,790 --> 02:30:26,930
with my buddy Gilmore.

3355
02:30:29,330 --> 02:30:30,380
MARISHA: A line of credit?

3356
02:30:31,490 --> 02:30:32,990
LIAM: Yeah, an I.O.U.

3357
02:30:34,660 --> 02:30:36,940
Once we’re back from our day.

3358
02:30:38,110 --> 02:30:40,010
MARISHA: So we’ve got like roughly 30k?

3359
02:30:40,380 --> 02:30:42,980
LIAM: In our possession now. Thirty-one.

3360
02:30:42,980 --> 02:30:43,960
ORION: We have over that.

3361
02:30:43,960 --> 02:30:47,660
Because Vex and Grog are with us. And they have --

3362
02:30:50,240 --> 02:30:51,320
MATT: She has all the money.

3363
02:30:51,320 --> 02:30:52,530
So we’ll just keep track of what you guys spend

3364
02:30:52,530 --> 02:30:54,830
and bring it back to Vex, your treasurer.

3365
02:30:54,830 --> 02:30:55,870
And she’ll be really angry

3366
02:30:55,870 --> 02:30:56,910
that you guys spent all that money.

3367
02:30:56,910 --> 02:30:57,300
LIAM: She’s trying, she’s trying,

3368
02:30:57,300 --> 02:30:58,080
it’s coming up on my phone.

3369
02:30:58,080 --> 02:31:00,170
ORION: The trick is, we don’t know how much the total is.

3370
02:31:00,170 --> 02:31:03,970
MARISHA: We generally would if our party’s here.

3371
02:31:03,970 --> 02:31:06,860
She just can’t tell us at this moment.

3372
02:31:07,240 --> 02:31:08,200
ORION: It’s well over thirty.

3373
02:31:08,200 --> 02:31:09,790
I think we have closer to fifty.

3374
02:31:11,040 --> 02:31:11,900
... maybe forty.

3375
02:31:12,460 --> 02:31:13,690
MATT: So she presents this dagger to you guys --

3376
02:31:13,690 --> 02:31:14,120
MARISHA: We don’t want to deplete all of our funds.
MATT: So she presents this dagger to you guys --

3377
02:31:14,120 --> 02:31:16,090
SHERRI: "This is a fine dagger,
MARISHA: We don’t want to deplete all of our funds.

3378
02:31:16,090 --> 02:31:16,120
SHERRI: "This is a fine dagger,

3379
02:31:16,120 --> 02:31:16,780
"the blood runs themselves are enchanted --"

3380
02:31:16,780 --> 02:31:18,730
MARISHA: We also spent a lot on the keep,
"the blood runs themselves are enchanted --"

3381
02:31:18,730 --> 02:31:21,630
don’t forget that, we dumped a lot of money into the keep.

3382
02:31:21,630 --> 02:31:22,850
MATT: Yep, you did.

3383
02:31:22,850 --> 02:31:25,680
MARISHA: So we might have more like thirty.

3384
02:31:26,640 --> 02:31:28,290
MATT: You guys spent quite a bit on the keep.

3385
02:31:28,650 --> 02:31:29,330
All right.

3386
02:31:29,630 --> 02:31:31,140
PIKE: What’s this dagger?

3387
02:31:31,140 --> 02:31:34,130
SHERRI: "This dagger actually can take the lifeforce

3388
02:31:34,130 --> 02:31:36,830
"from an enemy when delivering a very strong blow."

3389
02:31:36,830 --> 02:31:39,540
MATT: Essentially, on a critical hit on the attack roll --

3390
02:31:39,540 --> 02:31:40,120
(all cheer)

3391
02:31:40,120 --> 02:31:40,860
ASHLEY: We got it.
(all cheer)

3392
02:31:40,860 --> 02:31:41,540
ORION: Here they are.
(all cheer)

3393
02:31:43,360 --> 02:31:45,020
MARISHA: How much money do we have?

3394
02:31:45,580 --> 02:31:47,730
LAURA: We have --hold on, let me look.

3395
02:31:47,730 --> 02:31:49,370
TRAVIS: Twenty-four thousand --

3396
02:31:50,050 --> 02:31:51,770
LAURA: No. I normally don’t,

3397
02:31:52,940 --> 02:31:55,800
LAURA: We have about 20,000, all right?

3398
02:31:55,800 --> 02:31:57,960
ORION: So we have 50,000 total.

3399
02:32:00,250 --> 02:32:03,050
Because we just had 30, we just got paid 30 grand, right?

3400
02:32:03,050 --> 02:32:03,970
MATT: Yeah, ten.
MARISHA: No.

3401
02:32:03,970 --> 02:32:05,290
MARISHA: Ten grand.

3402
02:32:05,290 --> 02:32:06,920
MATT: You got ten grand from Allura

3403
02:32:06,920 --> 02:32:08,250
and you currently have a floating --

3404
02:32:08,250 --> 02:32:09,820
MARISHA: And she added that.

3405
02:32:09,820 --> 02:32:10,370
ORION: That’s added?

3406
02:32:10,370 --> 02:32:13,050
LAURA: I already added that, we’re at 20,000.

3407
02:32:13,050 --> 02:32:14,880
ORION: I thought we were at 30 --

3408
02:32:14,880 --> 02:32:17,520
MARISHA: We spent almost 50,000 dollars on our keep.

3409
02:32:17,520 --> 02:32:18,650
ORION: Right, but --

3410
02:32:18,990 --> 02:32:21,760
TRAVIS: Plus those fucks in Kraghammer owe us a fortune.

3411
02:32:21,760 --> 02:32:22,430
LAURA: Yeah.

3412
02:32:22,430 --> 02:32:25,090
MATT: Yeah, 25,000 gold is still owed by

3413
02:32:25,090 --> 02:32:25,920
Lord Nostoc Greyspine.

3414
02:32:25,920 --> 02:32:27,200
ORION: That’s who owed us.

3415
02:32:27,960 --> 02:32:29,200
MARISHA: Yes, that’s what we’re saying.

3416
02:32:29,200 --> 02:32:29,630
ORION: What?

3417
02:32:29,630 --> 02:32:31,860
MARISHA: That’s why we’re saying we only have 20 or 30 --

3418
02:32:31,860 --> 02:32:34,840
TALIESIN: No, we haven’t gone back there.

3419
02:32:34,840 --> 02:32:36,110
ORION: So we’ll have to go back and get it.

3420
02:32:36,110 --> 02:32:37,010
TALIESIN: Eventually, yeah.

3421
02:32:37,710 --> 02:32:38,970
SHERRI: "So while you --"

3422
02:32:38,970 --> 02:32:41,060
LAURA: Will you point us a little bit out so we can see --

3423
02:32:41,900 --> 02:32:44,280
SHERRI: "As I was saying, this dagger,

3424
02:32:44,280 --> 02:32:47,600
"upon a very impactful wound on a foe,

"steals a bit of its life force,

3426

"dealing an additional ten necrotic damage,

3427
02:32:51,420 --> 02:32:54,410
"and then gives the wielder ten temporary hitpoints."

3428
02:32:54,970 --> 02:32:56,130
VEX: Whoa, that’s major.

3429
02:32:56,520 --> 02:32:57,390
SHERRI: "So there’s that.

3430

"We also have an enchanted heavy maul,

"and we have --this is quite a find here."

3432
02:33:03,640 --> 02:33:06,280
MATT: As she pulls out this wooden case,

3433
02:33:06,280 --> 02:33:09,470
she pulls back the wooden top to it. As she does,

3434
02:33:09,470 --> 02:33:10,830
you can see there’s a little bit of ice crystal

3435
02:33:10,830 --> 02:33:13,090
that’s gathered along the interior of the wooden case.

3436
02:33:13,610 --> 02:33:15,330
There inside sits a short sword,

3437
02:33:15,330 --> 02:33:17,570
a relatively thick short blade,

3438
02:33:17,570 --> 02:33:20,050
but the blade itself is like a blue,

3439
02:33:20,050 --> 02:33:22,120
almost glimmering metal, and there’s

3440
02:33:22,120 --> 02:33:25,800
actually a rising frozen mist that drifts off the blade.

3441
02:33:25,800 --> 02:33:29,220
SHERRI: "This is an enchanted frostbrand.

3442

"you have resistance to any fire damage you would take.

02:39:51,920 --> 02:39:52,970
TALIESIN: That’s hilarious.

3608
02:39:53,360 --> 02:39:55,450
MATT: Timing is everything, folks. Timing is everything.

3609
02:39:55,450 --> 02:39:56,360
TALIESIN: Timing is everything.

3610
02:39:56,360 --> 02:39:58,890
PIKE: I have one dragon fang around my neck.

3611
02:40:01,210 --> 02:40:03,370
MATT: That’s a keepsake for actually slaying a dragon.

3612
02:40:03,800 --> 02:40:06,010
You’re welcome to trade that. It’s worth quite a bit.

3613
02:40:06,010 --> 02:40:06,410
MARISHA: No.

3614
02:40:06,410 --> 02:40:06,780
TALIESIN: No.

3615
02:40:06,780 --> 02:40:08,040
ASHLEY: That was the white dragon?

3616
02:40:08,040 --> 02:40:08,960
MATT: That was the white dragon.

3617
02:40:08,970 --> 02:40:10,660
ORION: Yeah, it was the white dragon you killed.

3618
02:40:11,230 --> 02:40:12,430
MATT: That’s the one that you got the final blow on.

3619
02:40:12,430 --> 02:40:13,970
MARISHA: What was your persuasion?
MATT: That’s the one that you got the final blow on.

3620
02:40:13,970 --> 02:40:15,060
TALIESIN: Not worth the memory of killing a white dragon.
MARISHA: What was your persuasion?

3621
02:40:15,060 --> 02:40:16,890
TALIESIN: Not worth the memory of killing a white dragon.

3622
02:40:16,890 --> 02:40:17,920
ASHLEY: I know, I gotta keep it.

3623
02:40:17,920 --> 02:40:18,330
MATT: Anyway.

3624
02:40:18,330 --> 02:40:18,900
TALIESIN: Gotta keep it.

3625
02:40:19,220 --> 02:40:21,300
ASHLEY: Keepsake, can’t put a price on it.

3626
02:40:21,300 --> 02:40:22,410
LIAM: Ten. Ten, they rolled a ten.

3627
02:40:22,410 --> 02:40:24,600
MATT: They rolled a ten. She says,

3628
02:40:25,640 --> 02:40:27,520
SHERRI: "Dragons’ teeth actually, strangely enough,

3629
02:40:27,520 --> 02:40:29,090
"are a little easier to find.

3630
02:40:30,160 --> 02:40:32,760
"I would put, each dragon’s tooth available

3631
02:40:32,760 --> 02:40:37,770
"would probably add about 250 gold pieces to the exchange."

3632
02:40:39,130 --> 02:40:40,660
TRAVIS: We’ve got three.

3633
02:40:40,660 --> 02:40:43,870
KEYLETH: And how about the basilisk eggs? While we’re --

3634
02:40:43,870 --> 02:40:44,660
LIAM: Get it out out.

3635
02:40:45,320 --> 02:40:47,470
KEYLETH: --cleaning our bag out, exactly.

3636
02:40:47,470 --> 02:40:50,340
TRAVIS: We have two basilisk eggs we’re willing to part with.

3637
02:40:50,850 --> 02:40:53,320
MATT: As you pull out the basilisk eggs,

3638
02:40:53,820 --> 02:40:56,010
you pull it out and immediately there is a stench

3639
02:40:56,680 --> 02:40:58,080
that is emanating from these eggs

3640
02:40:58,080 --> 02:40:59,140
that have been in your bag of holding

3641
02:40:59,140 --> 02:41:01,200
for probably close to eight or nine months.

3642
02:41:02,090 --> 02:41:03,960
GROG: No, the smell means they’re good.

3643
02:41:05,630 --> 02:41:07,560
MATT: This is now the fourth time she’s looked at you

3644
02:41:07,560 --> 02:41:10,170
with a deadpan glance and adjusted her glasses.

3645
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:13,310
SHERRI: "We’re not interested in the eggs,

3646
02:41:13,310 --> 02:41:14,400
"but thank you anyway."

3647
02:41:14,650 --> 02:41:19,480
GROG: All right, we do have three pints of dragon’s blood.

3648
02:41:19,980 --> 02:41:21,420
VEX: This is super, super powerful.

3649
02:41:21,420 --> 02:41:23,950
GROG: It might’ve congealed a little bit actually, though.

3650
02:41:24,580 --> 02:41:27,540
PIKE: No, it’s absolutely just really fresh because we

3651
02:41:27,540 --> 02:41:27,710
put it in Tupperware.

3652
02:41:27,710 --> 02:41:30,440
SHERRI: "We’ll stick with the scales for now."
put it in Tupperware.

3653
02:41:30,440 --> 02:41:31,610
LAURA: You’ll stick with the scales.

3654
02:41:31,610 --> 02:41:33,760
GROG: Right, any chance you’d be interested

3655
02:41:33,760 --> 02:41:35,760
in claws of an umber hulk?

3656
02:41:39,330 --> 02:41:43,420
LIAM: I like that the 400,000 people who saw that thing

3657
02:41:43,420 --> 02:41:44,700
are tuning in to the shopping episode.

3658
02:41:44,700 --> 02:41:46,090
TALIESIN AND MARISHA: To the shopping episode!
are tuning in to the shopping episode.

3659
02:41:46,580 --> 02:41:47,260
ORION: Hi everybody.
LIAM: We’ve been fighting and killing for weeks,

3660
02:41:47,260 --> 02:41:49,500
LIAM: We’ve been fighting and killing for weeks,

3661
02:41:49,500 --> 02:41:51,860
and now we’re haggling over prices.

3662
02:41:51,860 --> 02:41:53,730
ORION: But we do need new gear.

3663
02:41:53,730 --> 02:41:54,570
MATT: Timing is everything.

3664
02:41:54,570 --> 02:41:55,560
MARISHA: We do need new gear.

3665
02:41:56,420 --> 02:41:58,800
MATT: This has now turned into the flea-market episode.

3666
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,330
Hey, you guys guide the story. It’s fun though.

3667
02:42:02,330 --> 02:42:03,780
MARISHA: You guys guide the story.
Hey, you guys guide the story. It’s fun though.

3668
02:42:04,990 --> 02:42:07,230
SHERRI: "We’d say with the credit from the dragon scales,

3669
02:42:07,230 --> 02:42:11,390
"that’ll take 10,000, 11,000 away from the current pricing,

3670
02:42:11,390 --> 02:42:16,280
"that would put us at 39,815 for this batch."

3671
02:42:17,020 --> 02:42:19,770
KEYLETH: So can we open that line of credit

3672
02:42:19,770 --> 02:42:20,830
we were talking about?

3673
02:42:20,830 --> 02:42:22,290
SHERRI: "What line of credit?"

3674
02:42:22,900 --> 02:42:25,600
KEYLETH: That line we’re talking about right now.

3675
02:42:26,130 --> 02:42:27,870
(all laugh)

3676
02:42:27,870 --> 02:42:28,840
TIBERIUS: Well said, your majesty.

3677
02:42:28,840 --> 02:42:31,550
KEYLETH: That one that I just said two seconds ago?

3678
02:42:32,360 --> 02:42:35,850
LIAM: Wait, DM, where am I with Gilmore?

3679
02:42:35,850 --> 02:42:36,930
MATT: We’ll get to that right now.

3680
02:42:39,530 --> 02:42:40,830
ORION: It takes time to make a --

3681
02:42:40,830 --> 02:42:43,290
VEX: We could advertise for Gilmore.

3682
02:42:44,980 --> 02:42:45,640
KEYLETH: Yeah.

3683
02:42:45,640 --> 02:42:47,440
PIKE: We could advertise, but maybe we should wait

3684
02:42:47,440 --> 02:42:51,790
until they get back so if their walk goes really well,

3685
02:42:51,790 --> 02:42:56,020
whatever that means, we could maybe try to strike a deal.

3686
02:42:56,020 --> 02:42:57,100
KEYLETH: Right, put this on layaway?

3687
02:42:57,100 --> 02:42:58,740
VEX: He’ll probably give us everything for free.

3688
02:42:58,740 --> 02:43:01,090
PIKE: Because we probably need to talk to Gilmore about the credit.

3689
02:43:01,530 --> 02:43:01,890
TIBERIUS: True.

3690
02:43:01,890 --> 02:43:02,490
PERCY: Yes, that’s fair.

3691
02:43:02,490 --> 02:43:04,660
KEYLETH: So can we hold this for now?

3692
02:43:04,660 --> 02:43:05,570
PIKE: We’ll wait until Gilmore gets back.

3693
02:43:05,570 --> 02:43:06,660
SHERRI: "Certainly."
PIKE: We’ll wait until Gilmore gets back.

3694
02:43:06,660 --> 02:43:07,710
KEYLETH: Oh, good.

3695
02:43:07,710 --> 02:43:08,980
SHERRI: "If you wish."

3696
02:43:08,980 --> 02:43:10,780
MATT: Starts putting everything into

3697
02:43:10,780 --> 02:43:12,430
a small layaway pile in the corner.

3698
02:43:12,910 --> 02:43:17,060
KEYLETH: So you guys. Natural history museum?

3699
02:43:17,060 --> 02:43:19,060
Pizza and then natural history museum?

3700
02:43:19,060 --> 02:43:20,450
TIBERIUS: What is pizza?

3701
02:43:20,450 --> 02:43:22,220
MATT: In the meantime.

3702
02:43:22,220 --> 02:43:23,980
TIBERIUS: It sounds wonderful.

3703
02:43:24,530 --> 02:43:26,300
KEYLETH: We’ve got time, we’ve gotta wait

3704
02:43:26,300 --> 02:43:27,660
for their man-date, we can go see some sights.

3705
02:43:27,660 --> 02:43:29,400
MATT: In the meantime.
for their man-date, we can go see some sights.

3706
02:43:30,400 --> 02:43:30,690
LIAM: In-between time.

3707
02:43:30,690 --> 02:43:31,610
MATT: Vax.
LIAM: In-between time.

3708
02:43:31,610 --> 02:43:36,210
MATT: Yes. Gilmore, who has

3709
02:43:36,210 --> 02:43:39,210
sweeped you out into the middle of Abedar’s Promenade,

3710
02:43:40,210 --> 02:43:43,280
takes you by the arm and begins to lead you happily

3711
02:43:43,280 --> 02:43:46,240
up towards the Erudite Quarter of Emon,

3712
02:43:46,240 --> 02:43:48,330
which has a secondary wall around it as well.

3713
02:43:48,830 --> 02:43:49,720
As he brings you along,

3714
02:43:49,720 --> 02:43:52,810
he talks happily and loudly about how,

3715
02:43:52,810 --> 02:43:55,300
GILMORE: "It’s rather wonderful the way that we were

3716
02:43:55,300 --> 02:43:57,580
"presented with this opportunity over in Westruun.

3717
02:43:57,580 --> 02:44:01,000
"It’s magnificent, the team they’ve assembled

3718
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:03,960
"to build this brand. I’m very excited at how they

3719
02:44:03,960 --> 02:44:06,270
"brought it to my attention. I wanted to keep things

3720
02:44:06,270 --> 02:44:09,600
"very localized, of course, but it seems--"

3721
02:44:10,620 --> 02:44:12,160
VAX: Will you trust the folk in Emon

3722
02:44:12,160 --> 02:44:14,620
to handle your business or will you go between?

3723
02:44:14,620 --> 02:44:16,620
GILMORE: "The folk in Westruun?"

3724
02:44:16,620 --> 02:44:17,230
VAX: Yes.
GILMORE: "The folk in Westruun?"

3725
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:19,880
GILMORE: "I have a couple of friends there that will

3726
02:44:19,880 --> 02:44:23,530
"oversee the process, but I will be very involved

3727
02:44:23,530 --> 02:44:26,370
"and keeping an eye, so I’m not too terribly worried.

3728
02:44:26,370 --> 02:44:27,980
"Besides, it’s a much smaller business

3729
02:44:27,980 --> 02:44:29,290
"we’re running there and it’ll be fine.

3730
02:44:30,210 --> 02:44:31,210
"Oh, look ahead.

3731
02:44:31,210 --> 02:44:33,010
MATT: As you guys step into the Erudite Quarter,

3732
02:44:33,010 --> 02:44:34,590
he’s now brought you into essentially what is

3733
02:44:34,590 --> 02:44:38,360
an outdoor botanical garden that is just a very nice walk.

3734
02:44:38,580 --> 02:44:42,290
Grass across the ground, with fine well-cut bushes.

3735
02:44:42,290 --> 02:44:45,860
There is a canopy of beautiful trees that are arcane,

3736
02:44:45,860 --> 02:44:48,750
through arcane means, twisted and sculpted to form

3737
02:44:48,750 --> 02:44:51,770
this long tunnel. It’s strangely romantic.

3738
02:44:53,340 --> 02:44:54,760
As Gilmore begins to walk you down,

3739
02:44:54,760 --> 02:44:56,370
there’s a fountain to the side, and he says,

3740
02:44:59,530 --> 02:45:02,350
GILMORE: "What about you? How’s Vox Machina been?

3741
02:45:02,350 --> 02:45:07,040
"How’ve they been treating you? How are you, Vax?

3742
02:45:07,640 --> 02:45:10,580
VAX: Well, we’re tired, to be sure.

3743
02:45:10,580 --> 02:45:14,640
I was not kidding before, we really are lucky to be alive.

3744
02:45:15,330 --> 02:45:18,760
And that’s thanks in large part to

3745
02:45:18,760 --> 02:45:22,270
a lot of the gear you outfitted us with the last time.

3746
02:45:22,810 --> 02:45:24,940
GILMORE: "Wondrous, I’m happy to help.

3747
02:45:24,940 --> 02:45:27,200
"And have you been keeping up your end of the bargain?

3748
02:45:27,200 --> 02:45:29,250
"Have you been singing the praises of

3749
02:45:29,250 --> 02:45:32,220
"Gilmore’s Glorious Goods across Kraghammer and beyond?"

3750
02:45:32,830 --> 02:45:34,660
VAX: You were mentioned in Kraghammer.

3751
02:45:34,660 --> 02:45:38,730
I regret to inform you, though, that we

3752
02:45:38,730 --> 02:45:41,130
were forced to travel underground rather quickly

3753
02:45:41,130 --> 02:45:47,070
and the duergar and the other things that we ran into

3754
02:45:47,070 --> 02:45:50,490
were not really customers you’d want to deal with.

3755
02:45:51,610 --> 02:45:55,420
No, our lives were too much in harm’s way.

3756
02:45:55,420 --> 02:45:57,330
But now that we’re above ground,

3757
02:45:57,330 --> 02:46:00,380
I’m looking to pick up where I left off.

3758
02:46:00,380 --> 02:46:01,930
GILMORE: "Very well."
And do your shop honor.

3759
02:46:01,980 --> 02:46:05,070
VAX: Your contribution to what we’ve done --

3760
02:46:05,070 --> 02:46:06,830
LIAM: And I place my hand on his hand.

3761
02:46:10,410 --> 02:46:13,490
VAX: --was no small part in our survival.

3762
02:46:14,140 --> 02:46:16,800
LIAM: And I give it just a little squeeze.

3763
02:46:20,120 --> 02:46:21,570
VAX: And I want to thank you.

3764
02:46:24,620 --> 02:46:27,600
I don’t know that I would be standing here

3765
02:46:27,600 --> 02:46:28,910
if not for your help.

3766
02:46:30,430 --> 02:46:34,650
GILMORE: "Had it not been for Gilmore’s Glorious Goods."

3767
02:46:34,650 --> 02:46:37,740
(all laugh)

3768
02:46:37,850 --> 02:46:39,120
MATT: He looks you deep in the eyes,

3769
02:46:39,120 --> 02:46:40,580
pats the top of your hand, and goes,

3770
02:46:42,720 --> 02:46:46,180
GILMORE: "Vax. This, that moment,

3771
02:46:47,100 --> 02:46:49,520
"that is why I do what I do."

3772
02:46:54,500 --> 02:46:57,690
VAX: You’re a unique man, Gilmore. No question.

3773
02:46:59,160 --> 02:47:01,130
Never met anyone quite like you.

3774
02:47:01,620 --> 02:47:04,930
GILMORE: "Well. Would you care to share a glass of wine

3775
02:47:04,930 --> 02:47:07,940
"with a man not quite like anyone else you’ve met?"

3776
02:47:08,440 --> 02:47:11,400
VAX: Indeed. What do you recommend in the area?

3777
02:47:11,400 --> 02:47:14,250
GILMORE: "Oh, please, come, there are casks that

3778
02:47:14,250 --> 02:47:17,840
"pour the finest of honeyed Syngoran wine.

3779
02:47:17,840 --> 02:47:19,420
"I know perhaps you’ve not been home

3780
02:47:19,420 --> 02:47:20,480
"for quite some time?"

3781
02:47:21,310 --> 02:47:25,880
VAX: That’s a complicated thing for me,

3782
02:47:28,300 --> 02:47:31,140
one that I’m not really quite ready to talk about yet.

3783
02:47:31,140 --> 02:47:31,640
GILMORE: "Oh."

3784
02:47:31,640 --> 02:47:32,690
VAX: Maybe someday.

3785
02:47:32,690 --> 02:47:34,030
GILMORE: "Maybe with enough wine."

3786
02:47:36,610 --> 02:47:38,020
VAX: You old so-and-so.

3787
02:47:39,100 --> 02:47:39,720
MARISHA: You old so-and-so.

3788
02:47:39,720 --> 02:47:42,110
MATT: About an hour and a half,

3789
02:47:42,110 --> 02:47:45,300
time passes before eventually there’s a loud clattering

3790
02:47:45,300 --> 02:47:47,940
at the front of Gilmore’s Glorious Goods,

3791
02:47:47,940 --> 02:47:52,770
where a laughing Vax and Gilmore come stumbling in,

3792
02:47:52,770 --> 02:47:56,290
flush of face, with emptied goblets,

3793
02:47:56,910 --> 02:47:58,530
laughing to themselves.

3794
02:47:59,080 --> 02:48:00,800
Is there anything specific before this moment

3795
02:48:00,800 --> 02:48:01,540
that you wanted to ask --

3796
02:48:01,540 --> 02:48:03,330
VAX: I took the duergar,

3797
02:48:03,330 --> 02:48:05,140
I was holding her right over the cliff,

3798
02:48:05,140 --> 02:48:08,380
and I just cut, and she fell! She fell!

3799
02:48:08,380 --> 02:48:10,210
I didn’t know what I was doing, I just did it!

3800
02:48:11,240 --> 02:48:16,350
GILMORE: "You are ridiculous, Vax'ildan! Oh, it tickles me."

3801
02:48:16,350 --> 02:48:18,670
PIKE: Hi! Hello!

3802
02:48:18,670 --> 02:48:20,320
GILMORE: "Oh, good to see your friends."

3803
02:48:20,320 --> 02:48:21,500
PIKE: Sounds like you had fun.

3804
02:48:21,500 --> 02:48:25,450
VAX: Family. Family, family.

3805
02:48:25,450 --> 02:48:27,080
I’ve had a couple of drinks.

3806
02:48:27,570 --> 02:48:29,540
I’m an adult, I can do that.

3807
02:48:31,880 --> 02:48:32,590
VAX: What have you found?

3808
02:48:32,590 --> 02:48:34,130
Have you guys been shopping?

3809
02:48:34,830 --> 02:48:35,780
KEYLETH: Well, we have!

3810
02:48:35,780 --> 02:48:36,350
TIBERIUS: Yes!
KEYLETH: Well, we have!

3811
02:48:36,350 --> 02:48:38,410
KEYLETH: We were hoping that you and

3812
02:48:38,410 --> 02:48:41,900
Gilmore had a wonderful time and that,

3813
02:48:41,900 --> 02:48:43,160
we just thought we’d wait for you.

3814
02:48:43,160 --> 02:48:45,730
We didn’t want to make any final decisions without

3815
02:48:45,730 --> 02:48:47,730
one of our main party members.

3816
02:48:47,950 --> 02:48:49,080
GILMORE: "It was delightful.

3817
02:48:49,080 --> 02:48:53,170
"You travel with the finest companion.

3818
02:48:54,020 --> 02:48:57,860
"We told stories, we cried, we laughed.

3819
02:48:57,860 --> 02:48:59,230
"It was a delight."

3820
02:49:01,440 --> 02:49:02,670
GILMORE: "I’ve had a few."

3821
02:49:03,210 --> 02:49:05,050
MATT: He collects himself for a minute.

3822
02:49:05,050 --> 02:49:08,830
LIAM: I pat him on the back, I do a little circle with my hand.

3823
02:49:10,260 --> 02:49:11,240
MARISHA: Remember, you have advantage.

3824
02:49:11,240 --> 02:49:14,610
GILMORE: "I’m not as spry as I once was, unfortunately.

3825
02:49:16,770 --> 02:49:19,720
"But yes! Business to attend. What do you need?

3826
02:49:19,720 --> 02:49:20,960
"What can we do?"

3827
02:49:20,960 --> 02:49:24,100
MATT: At which point Sherri, waiting in the back, says,

3828
02:49:24,930 --> 02:49:30,220
SHERRI: "Sir, they’ve requested perhaps a few things in bulk.

3829
02:49:31,020 --> 02:49:32,820
"The current amount comes to about roughly

3830
02:49:32,820 --> 02:49:35,980
"40,000 gold, with your discount."

3831
02:49:35,980 --> 02:49:38,560
GILMORE: "Forty thousand gold, oh, well.

3832
02:49:38,560 --> 02:49:40,560
"Certainly. What seems to be the problem?"

3833
02:49:42,900 --> 02:49:47,620
PIKE: Well, I don’t know. We were just talking about,

3834
02:49:47,620 --> 02:49:50,060
since we’re purchasing so many things,

3835
02:49:50,060 --> 02:49:55,980
and since we’ve gained some popularity here in Emon,

3836
02:49:55,980 --> 02:49:59,770
walking around, people are noticing us walking around...

3837
02:50:01,650 --> 02:50:03,500
ASHLEY: I shouldn’t be the one talking right now.

3838
02:50:05,360 --> 02:50:07,540
PIKE: Maybe we could open up a line of credit.

3839
02:50:08,680 --> 02:50:10,180
VAX: Obviously we’re only shopping

3840
02:50:10,180 --> 02:50:11,860
with you, Gilmore, at this point.

3841
02:50:13,080 --> 02:50:14,730
MATT: He looks about the rest of the group and says,

3842
02:50:16,430 --> 02:50:18,780
GILMORE: "Not everyone seems to be wearing

3843
02:50:18,780 --> 02:50:22,200
"the same patented Gilmore’s Glorious Armor

3844
02:50:22,200 --> 02:50:26,490
"that was given not too long ago. So that’s not true."

3845
02:50:26,490 --> 02:50:28,690
TIBERIUS: We did find some off of dead things.

3846
02:50:28,690 --> 02:50:29,450
VAX: Yes.

3847
02:50:29,450 --> 02:50:31,660
GILMORE: "And those dead things are not

3848
02:50:31,660 --> 02:50:34,340
"under the umbrella of Gilmore’s Glorious Expansion."

3849
02:50:34,340 --> 02:50:35,040
TIBERIUS: Oh.

3850
02:50:38,340 --> 02:50:41,610
GILMORE: "But should we discuss this,

3851
02:50:41,610 --> 02:50:43,170
"where would this credit be placed against,

3852
02:50:43,170 --> 02:50:46,960
"what do you have that you could ante?"

3853
02:50:46,960 --> 02:50:47,890
VAX: What have you guys been talking about?

3854
02:50:47,890 --> 02:50:50,690
We do have a big pile of dragon’s scales and some gem --

3855
02:50:50,690 --> 02:50:52,400
VEX: We do.

3856
02:50:52,400 --> 02:50:54,010
PERCY: We also are owed money.

3857
02:50:54,010 --> 02:50:54,660
VAX: And we are owed money in Kraghammer.

3858
02:50:54,660 --> 02:50:56,170
VEX: One question that
VAX: And we are owed money in Kraghammer.

3859
02:50:56,170 --> 02:50:58,140
Grog just whispered to me.

3860
02:50:58,140 --> 02:50:59,490
VAX: Yes?

3861
02:50:59,490 --> 02:51:01,610
VEX: How much is a platinum worth?

3862
02:51:03,060 --> 02:51:06,220
GILMORE: "What is a platinum? Platinum is worth ten gold pieces."

3863
02:51:09,340 --> 02:51:10,620
LIAM: Where we at, girl?

3864
02:51:11,780 --> 02:51:12,410
TIBERIUS: She is displeased.

3865
02:51:12,410 --> 02:51:14,530
VEX: We may have a lot more money than I thought we had,

3866
02:51:14,530 --> 02:51:17,320
because Grog’s been hiding money in the bag of holding.

3867
02:51:18,240 --> 02:51:19,730
(all laugh)

3868
02:51:20,770 --> 02:51:22,040
GROG: It’s really shiny.

3869
02:51:26,410 --> 02:51:30,180
TRAVIS: I’m in trouble, Matt. She’s really mad.

3870
02:51:32,270 --> 02:51:34,350
MARISHA: Wait, is this like when

3871
02:51:34,350 --> 02:51:36,620
you slapped Trinket on the ass mad?

3872
02:51:37,020 --> 02:51:39,210
LAURA: No. Not close, not even close.

3873
02:51:39,210 --> 02:51:41,460
Doesn’t mean as much as Trinket means.

3874
02:51:41,460 --> 02:51:42,490
LIAM: This is finances,

3875
02:51:42,490 --> 02:51:44,110
this sounds like a married couple.

3876
02:51:45,960 --> 02:51:49,070
PERCY: How much platinum do we have hiding

3877
02:51:49,070 --> 02:51:50,260
in the bag of holding?

3878
02:51:50,890 --> 02:51:52,770
TRAVIS: I don’t have the number in front of me,

3879
02:51:52,770 --> 02:51:54,620
but it’s at least 150.

3880
02:51:56,430 --> 02:51:57,240
LAURA: Yeah.

3881
02:51:57,240 --> 02:51:59,870
VAX: Where did we procure that again, Grog?

3882
02:51:59,870 --> 02:52:01,700
I’m sorry, I’m a little fershnickered.

3883
02:52:01,700 --> 02:52:04,650
GROG: I don’t remember, but it’s in the bag of holding.

3884
02:52:05,790 --> 02:52:07,560
VEX: I remember getting platinum.

3885
02:52:07,560 --> 02:52:09,090
KEYLETH: I do remember getting platinum, too.

3886
02:52:09,090 --> 02:52:10,650
MATT: But you don’t have a number.

3887
02:52:11,120 --> 02:52:14,430
TRAVIS: No, I know it’s at least 100, at least 150,

3888
02:52:14,430 --> 02:52:16,370
I think it’s somewhere up north of 150,

3889
02:52:16,370 --> 02:52:17,640
I just can’t remember the number.

3890
02:52:17,640 --> 02:52:19,680
LIAM: Did we get that from the dragon,

3891
02:52:19,680 --> 02:52:21,340
where did we get that?

3892
02:52:21,340 --> 02:52:23,000
MATT: It was a combination of the dragon,

3893
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:23,980
the horde you rage-looted --

3894
02:52:23,980 --> 02:52:24,940
LAURA: Rage-hoarding.
the horde you rage-looted --

3895
02:52:25,460 --> 02:52:26,200
LAURA: Rage-looting.

3896
02:52:26,200 --> 02:52:26,660
LIAM: I’ll never forget the rage-looting.

3897
02:52:26,660 --> 02:52:28,200
ASHLEY: Rage-looting.
LIAM: I’ll never forget the rage-looting.

3898
02:52:28,430 --> 02:52:30,110
GROG: It’s my shiny, though,

3899
02:52:30,110 --> 02:52:31,760
I didn’t want to give it to her, though.

3900
02:52:31,760 --> 02:52:34,460
She’s evil. You see how she haggles!

3901
02:52:34,460 --> 02:52:37,820
VAX: It’s true. She’s my sister, I know, Grog.

3902
02:52:37,820 --> 02:52:40,850
But right now we need to put that aside

3903
02:52:40,850 --> 02:52:42,650
and do what’s best for the party.

3904
02:52:44,420 --> 02:52:46,590
GROG: Well, we could buy a party with all that.

3905
02:52:46,590 --> 02:52:48,000
(all laugh)

3906
02:52:48,330 --> 02:52:49,580
VAX: Not that kind of party, Grog.

3907
02:52:49,580 --> 02:52:50,770
VEX: I think we have enough to buy

3908
02:52:50,770 --> 02:52:52,660
everything if you guys want.

3909
02:52:53,300 --> 02:52:56,410
VAX: Grog, money is meant to be spent.

3910
02:52:57,940 --> 02:52:59,390
GROG: I’m going to drink!

3911
02:53:00,340 --> 02:53:02,010
(all laugh)

3912
02:53:02,440 --> 02:53:03,660
PIKE: That solves everything.

3913
02:53:03,660 --> 02:53:06,380
MATT: Scanlan goes,

3914
02:53:06,380 --> 02:53:09,130
SCANLAN: I agree. Drinks and whoring.

3915
02:53:09,570 --> 02:53:11,880
MATT: And smacks Grog in the side.

3916
02:53:11,880 --> 02:53:16,200
The two of them leave off into the evening to go ahead and

3917
02:53:16,200 --> 02:53:17,530
make use of their return to Emon properly.

3918
02:53:17,530 --> 02:53:19,970
LIAM: Vax looks at Gilmore and just shakes his head.

3919
02:53:22,280 --> 02:53:23,260
GILMORE: "There is business to be had,

3920
02:53:23,260 --> 02:53:24,450
"but let’s get business out of the way

3921
02:53:24,450 --> 02:53:26,450
"so we can get to pleasure."

3922
02:53:27,100 --> 02:53:28,240
ASHLEY: Oh, shit.

3923
02:53:28,240 --> 02:53:28,980
LIAM: Cheers to that.

3924
02:53:29,660 --> 02:53:30,650
MARISHA: Cheers to that.

3925
02:53:31,080 --> 02:53:32,640
TALIESIN: I have tinkering to do anyway.

3926
02:53:34,210 --> 02:53:35,360
VEX: What did we agree the total

3927
02:53:35,360 --> 02:53:37,060
for everything we wanted was?

3928
02:53:37,060 --> 02:53:39,610
GILMORE: "Roughly 39,500 gold pieces."

3929
02:53:39,610 --> 02:53:40,330
VAX: Pish-posh.

3930
02:53:40,330 --> 02:53:42,060
VEX: Roughly. Gilmore.

3931
02:53:42,970 --> 02:53:44,010
GILMORE: "That’s with the discount!

3932
02:53:44,010 --> 02:53:45,180
"I already offered this to you,

3933
02:53:45,180 --> 02:53:46,980
"and you haven’t even kept up your end of the bargain

3934

"immortalized Gilmore’s Glorious Armor."

3936
02:53:53,330 --> 02:53:57,860
VAX: We would, Gilmore, we would be wearing that.

3937
02:53:58,570 --> 02:53:59,940
Again, we nearly died.

3938
02:54:01,120 --> 02:54:04,160
The armor that you gave me is gone, and

3939
02:54:04,160 --> 02:54:05,960
I’m lucky to be alive today,

3940
02:54:05,960 --> 02:54:09,060
and that armor helped me be where I am at the moment.

3941
02:54:09,460 --> 02:54:10,900
GILMORE: "How much credit do you wish to open?"

3942
02:54:11,860 --> 02:54:12,830
VAX: Fifty gold.

3943
02:54:14,120 --> 02:54:15,760
PIKE: Thousand? Fifty thousand?

3944
02:54:15,760 --> 02:54:17,760
VAX: Fifty, ah yes. Fifty thousand.

3945
02:54:18,240 --> 02:54:19,620
GILMORE: "Because 50 gold I can definitely do."

3946
02:54:19,620 --> 02:54:22,360
VAX: We’ve been out drinking for two hours, man.

3947
02:54:22,360 --> 02:54:23,730
GILMORE: "This is true. I’m sorry."

3948
02:54:23,730 --> 02:54:25,460
ASHLEY: One million, please.

3949
02:54:25,930 --> 02:54:29,660
GILMORE: "That’s a tough order."

3950
02:54:30,210 --> 02:54:32,280
GILMORE: "You mentioned you had money

3951
02:54:32,280 --> 02:54:35,000
"waiting for you in Kraghammer. How much was --"

3952
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:36,100
VEX: Yes, we do.

3953
02:54:36,100 --> 02:54:37,530
GILMORE: "How much is waiting for you there?"

3954
02:54:38,640 --> 02:54:39,960
VAX: Twenty-five, wasn’t it?

3955
02:54:40,220 --> 02:54:42,080
VEX: It was 25,000.

3956
02:54:42,080 --> 02:54:46,260
GILMORE: "How about we open a 25,000 gold piece

3959
02:54:53,280 --> 02:54:53,940
VAX: That’s fair.

3960
02:54:53,940 --> 02:54:56,430
GILMORE: "Giving you time to arrive. If it’s not paid,

02:55:00,440 --> 02:55:03,260
"But I’m sure that won’t be a worry, will it?"

3963
02:55:03,260 --> 02:55:05,000
TIBERIUS: How far is Kraghammer from here?

3964
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:05,740
PERCY: Not far.

3965
02:55:06,410 --> 02:55:08,850
VEX: It’s a week’s ride, isn’t it?

3966
02:55:08,850 --> 02:55:10,260
TIBERIUS: I can’t teleport everyone.

3967
02:55:11,820 --> 02:55:13,720
KEYLETH: Gilmore, question.

3968
02:55:13,720 --> 02:55:16,460
Maybe you should consider making little pins

3969
02:55:16,460 --> 02:55:19,150
that we could just wear on top of our armor?

3970
02:55:19,150 --> 02:55:21,950
Because wearing your armor,

3971
02:55:21,950 --> 02:55:24,760
we have our own clothes that we like,

3972
02:55:25,870 --> 02:55:27,080
so maybe like a pin.

3973
02:55:27,080 --> 02:55:28,180
MATT: He steps forward and says,

3974
02:55:28,180 --> 02:55:29,180
GILMORE: "Oh --"

3975
02:55:29,180 --> 02:55:30,030
KEYLETH: Or like a patch?

3976
02:55:30,030 --> 02:55:31,760
GILMORE: "--that’s not even a worry."

3977
02:55:31,760 --> 02:55:34,140
MATT: He pulls out a small implement, this wand,

3978
02:55:34,140 --> 02:55:35,470
and he flicks it over your shoulder.

3979
02:55:35,470 --> 02:55:38,890
And all of a sudden an arcane swirl around your armor,

3980
02:55:39,470 --> 02:55:42,510
with a big flash of sparks and glitter almost.

3981
02:55:42,510 --> 02:55:43,960
You look down and there is,

3982
02:55:43,960 --> 02:55:46,520
emblazoned upon your current armored form,

3983
02:55:47,120 --> 02:55:49,420
a symbol of Gilmore’s Glorious Goods

3984
02:55:49,420 --> 02:55:51,570
now permanently emblazoned on the leather.

3985
02:55:53,170 --> 02:55:54,010
KEYLETH: Ah!

3986
02:55:54,650 --> 02:55:55,840
GILMORE: "Easy enough to fix."

3987
02:55:55,840 --> 02:55:56,880
VAX: What a good idea.

3988
02:55:56,880 --> 02:55:57,440
KEYLETH: I was going to put it on that leather.

3989
02:55:57,440 --> 02:55:57,810
PERCY: Yes.
KEYLETH: I was going to put it on that leather.

3990
02:55:57,810 --> 02:55:58,880
KEYLETH: I was going to put it on that leather.

3991
02:56:00,570 --> 02:56:02,730
My mom gave this to me.

3992
02:56:02,730 --> 02:56:04,900
GILMORE: "Well, your mother has not provided for you

3993
02:56:04,900 --> 02:56:07,280
"the means of keeping the deal we already made."

3994
02:56:07,280 --> 02:56:09,630
KEYLETH: Can you take this off when we pay you back

3995
02:56:09,630 --> 02:56:10,930
and put it on that one?

3996
02:56:10,930 --> 02:56:12,860
KEYLETH: Oh, come on.

3997
02:56:15,820 --> 02:56:17,920
PERCY: I think it’ll transfer when you change.

3998
02:56:17,920 --> 02:56:19,610
KEYLETH: Will it transfer when I change armor?

3999
02:56:19,610 --> 02:56:20,560
GILMORE: "I don’t know."

4000
02:56:20,930 --> 02:56:23,880
(all laugh)

4001
02:56:25,200 --> 02:56:25,870
PIKE: We’ll find out.

4002
02:56:25,870 --> 02:56:27,530
GILMORE: "So. Twenty-five thousand gold line of credit,

4003
02:56:27,530 --> 02:56:28,850
"within a month or you’ll be hunted."

4004
02:56:29,390 --> 02:56:31,020
KEYLETH: Wait, do you really have a unicorn

4005
02:56:31,020 --> 02:56:32,480
as part of your logo?

4006
02:56:33,180 --> 02:56:34,440
GILMORE: "It’s…"

4007
02:56:34,440 --> 02:56:35,040
KEYLETH: What?

4008
02:56:35,040 --> 02:56:36,760
GILMORE: "It’s a creature of my creation,

4009
02:56:36,760 --> 02:56:37,680
"I designed it when I was a child --"

4010
02:56:37,680 --> 02:56:38,740
VAX: It’s a phallic thing.

4011
02:56:38,740 --> 02:56:39,710
KEYLETH: Ah.

4012
02:56:41,470 --> 02:56:44,090
VEX: So we open the 25,000 line of credit with you

4013
02:56:44,090 --> 02:56:45,850
and you give us all the things we want?

4014
02:56:46,600 --> 02:56:47,500
GILMORE: "If that is what you want."

4015
02:56:47,500 --> 02:56:49,090
VAX: Don’t we have a lot of platinum?

4016
02:56:49,090 --> 02:56:50,920
What are we dickering prices with?

4017
02:56:50,920 --> 02:56:52,690
VEX: Yes! Why don’t we just buy it now,

4018
02:56:52,690 --> 02:56:53,720
and then we won’t have a line of credit with Gilmore?

4019
02:56:53,720 --> 02:56:55,340
GROG: (cries)
and then we won’t have a line of credit with Gilmore?

4020
02:56:56,530 --> 02:56:58,640
VAX: Yes, we’ll use some of the platinum.

4021
02:56:58,640 --> 02:57:00,960
One platinum is equal to ten gold.

4022
02:57:00,960 --> 02:57:02,190
Sorry, Gilmore.

4023
02:57:02,900 --> 02:57:04,380
Trying to dicker over rates.

4024
02:57:04,380 --> 02:57:05,320
PIKE: Not a line of credit?

4025
02:57:05,320 --> 02:57:06,280
VAX: No line of credit,

4026
02:57:06,280 --> 02:57:09,900
we’ll pay for it outright in cold hard platinum.

4027
02:57:10,650 --> 02:57:12,670
MATT: You don’t have the amount of platinum with you.

4028
02:57:13,930 --> 02:57:15,000
LIAM: But Grog’s got it.

4029
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:17,000
MATT: Grog said, because he doesn’t have it in front of him,

4030
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:18,810
he has around 150 platinum.

4031
02:57:18,850 --> 02:57:20,750
VEX: We can pay him back, it’s true.
MATT: That’s roughly 1500 gold.

4032
02:57:20,750 --> 02:57:20,940
MATT: That’s roughly 1500 gold.

4033
02:57:20,940 --> 02:57:22,100
LIAM: But where is it?

4034
02:57:22,270 --> 02:57:23,480
MATT: It’s in the bag of holding, but he doesn’t have

4035
02:57:23,480 --> 02:57:24,980
the bag of holding information in front of him.

4036
02:57:24,980 --> 02:57:26,620
LIAM: He doesn’t have the info.

4037
02:57:26,620 --> 02:57:28,170
And because he doesn’t have the sheet --

4038
02:57:28,170 --> 02:57:28,810
TALIESIN: --next game.

4039
02:57:28,810 --> 02:57:31,080
LIAM: --and he can’t read the exact amount?

4040
02:57:31,080 --> 02:57:33,840
MATT: Yup. Because he said in memory

4041
02:57:33,840 --> 02:57:36,670
it’s 150 platinum. That’s only --

4042
02:57:36,670 --> 02:57:39,320
LIAM: I thought it was a 100,000.

4043
02:57:39,320 --> 02:57:40,080
MATT: Oh, no.

4044
02:57:40,080 --> 02:57:41,620
LAURA: No no no, 150 platinum.

4045
02:57:41,620 --> 02:57:42,810
LIAM: Oh, 150.

4046
02:57:42,810 --> 02:57:44,260
MATT: Hundred thousand you’d be the richest man

4047
02:57:44,260 --> 02:57:44,880
in the fucking world.

4048
02:57:44,880 --> 02:57:45,650
LIAM: Okay.
in the fucking world.

4049
02:57:47,620 --> 02:57:49,660
MATT: So 150 platinum --

4050
02:57:49,660 --> 02:57:50,370
VAX: What do you think, sis?

4051
02:57:50,370 --> 02:57:55,180
MATT: --based on memory is 11,500,

4052
02:57:55,180 --> 02:57:56,700
VAX: Vox Machina treasurer?
MATT: which is a little helpful.

4053
02:57:56,700 --> 02:57:57,550
VEX: Right.

4054
02:57:57,550 --> 02:57:58,160
VAX: What do you think?

4055
02:57:59,000 --> 02:58:01,230
VEX: That would put us at about 30,000

4056
02:58:01,230 --> 02:58:03,820
that we have to spend left,

4057
02:58:04,660 --> 02:58:08,210
which the signal cut out so it doesn’t matter.

4058
02:58:08,210 --> 02:58:08,740
MATT: No, we’ve got you.

4059
02:58:08,740 --> 02:58:08,960
MARISHA: No, we can hear you!

4060
02:58:08,960 --> 02:58:09,710
LIAM: No, we’ve got you.
MARISHA: No, we can hear you!

4061
02:58:09,710 --> 02:58:10,490
VEX: Okay.

4062
02:58:10,490 --> 02:58:14,510
VAX: So the total tab is what again, Gilmore?

4063
02:58:14,510 --> 02:58:16,100
LAURA: How much do we have?

4064
02:58:16,100 --> 02:58:18,040
He does have a picture of it.

4065
02:58:19,570 --> 02:58:22,760
We have 1,620 platinum.

4066
02:58:22,760 --> 02:58:23,530
MARISHA: What!

4067
02:58:23,530 --> 02:58:25,850
MATT: Is that right? There you go.

4068
02:58:26,740 --> 02:58:28,100
ORION: So that’s like--

4069
02:58:28,750 --> 02:58:30,990
MATT: 16,000 gold pieces.

4070
02:58:31,410 --> 02:58:33,460
VAX: All right. Spend it.

4071
02:58:34,280 --> 02:58:35,230
VAX: Spend it.

4072
02:58:35,230 --> 02:58:36,380
KEYLETH: All right. No!

4073
02:58:36,380 --> 02:58:38,590
PIKE: So we don’t need to open up a line of credit?

4074
02:58:38,590 --> 02:58:39,120
VAX: No.

4075
02:58:39,120 --> 02:58:42,170
MATT: Ten gold per platinum.

4076
02:58:42,170 --> 02:58:43,220
ORION: We have 1,000.

4077
02:58:43,220 --> 02:58:46,270
MATT: A thousand platinum. One thousand six hundred platinum.

4078
02:58:46,770 --> 02:58:48,140
Move the decimal point.

4079
02:58:48,140 --> 02:58:50,650
That brings it to 16,000 gold pieces.

4080
02:58:50,650 --> 02:58:51,980
ORION: Move two on that.

4081
02:58:51,980 --> 02:58:54,020
MATT: No, it’s not 100 gold per platinum,

4082
02:58:54,020 --> 02:58:54,890
ten gold per platinum.

4083
02:58:56,000 --> 02:58:57,240
MATT: I’ve been saying ten gold per platinum

4084
02:58:57,240 --> 02:58:58,050
this whole time, guys.

4085
02:58:58,610 --> 02:59:00,100
TALIESIN: No, I’m with you.

4086
02:59:00,100 --> 02:59:00,660
ORION: I get it.

4087
02:59:00,660 --> 02:59:02,410
LIAM: We’re losing our audience. Ring it up.

4088
02:59:02,410 --> 02:59:03,360
MATT: We’re getting into math in this.

4089
02:59:03,920 --> 02:59:06,660
MARISHA: Our charity, 826LA, after-school tutoring.

4090
02:59:08,600 --> 02:59:09,770
TALIESIN: It could’ve made this all go so much better.

4091
02:59:09,770 --> 02:59:11,660
MARISHA: Really good to have,
TALIESIN: It could’ve made this all go so much better.

4092
02:59:11,660 --> 02:59:14,440
MARISA: Your reading and your writing and your arithmetic.

4093
02:59:15,880 --> 02:59:17,330
TALIESIN: For players who can read good.

4094
02:59:17,960 --> 02:59:19,730
MARISHA: For players who can read good.

4095
02:59:20,140 --> 02:59:22,030
VAX: Ring it up, we’ll take it.

4096
02:59:22,030 --> 02:59:23,530
PIKE: We’ll take it all.

4097
02:59:23,530 --> 02:59:24,170
VAX: The whole lot.

4098
02:59:24,170 --> 02:59:26,720
PIKE: And then, could I commission you, by the way,

4099
02:59:26,720 --> 02:59:29,730
to maybe make some armor that’s really heavy armor

4100
02:59:29,730 --> 02:59:31,730
but very quiet?

4101
02:59:32,920 --> 02:59:34,090
GILMORE: "How heavy?"

4102
02:59:36,810 --> 02:59:39,140
PIKE: How heavy can you make it?

4103
02:59:39,140 --> 02:59:41,770
GILMORE: "I can work on plate armor if you’d like,

4104
02:59:41,770 --> 02:59:43,770
"but an enchantment of that magnitude would be

4105
02:59:43,770 --> 02:59:45,340
"the only enchantment it would have.

4106
02:59:45,970 --> 02:59:48,200
"So it would be the equivalent of full plate armor

4107
02:59:48,200 --> 02:59:50,530
"and the entire enchantment would enable you to

4108
02:59:50,530 --> 02:59:54,010
"move a little more easily inside it, and that would cost,

4109
02:59:54,010 --> 02:59:56,530
"it would take about, I'd say,

4110
02:59:56,530 --> 03:00:00,300
"a month to enchant on my end and would cost about,

4111
03:00:00,300 --> 03:00:03,000
"not including the cost of the actual armor,

4112
03:00:03,000 --> 03:00:06,250
"materials and time required, I’d put it at about

4113
03:00:08,320 --> 03:00:10,060
"8,000 gold pieces?"

4114
03:00:11,010 --> 03:00:11,720
VAX: Worth it.

4115
03:00:13,120 --> 03:00:14,200
VAX: We’ll fund the money.

4116
03:00:14,780 --> 03:00:17,850
PIKE: And it’ll just be really quiet?

4117
03:00:20,300 --> 03:00:23,360
GILMORE: "It will enable you to move freer within the armor."

4118
03:00:23,360 --> 03:00:26,650
VAX: By a turn. Is 8,000

4119
03:00:26,650 --> 03:00:30,170
Vox Machina’s rate, or the general rate?

4120
03:00:30,170 --> 03:00:31,820
GILMORE: "That is through our friendship

4121
03:00:31,820 --> 03:00:32,990
"and our current arrangement."

4122
03:00:32,990 --> 03:00:34,640
VAX: Thank you. It’s appreciated.

4123
03:00:34,640 --> 03:00:35,120
GILMORE: "Mm."

4124
03:00:37,330 --> 03:00:38,130
GILMORE: "Business is business,

4125
03:00:38,130 --> 03:00:39,610
"but please don’t take this solemn,

03:00:39,610 --> 03:00:40,800
VAX: Of course.
"but please don’t take this solemn,

"intense face to be anything other than friendship,

4129
03:00:45,040 --> 03:00:46,020
VAX: Understood.

4130
03:00:46,420 --> 03:00:47,280
GILMORE: "Good."

4131
03:00:47,280 --> 03:00:48,440
VAX: I’m not taking advantage.

4132
03:00:48,440 --> 03:00:49,610
GILMORE: "All right."

4133
03:00:51,130 --> 03:00:54,240
GILMORE: "So. To take all of these items,

4134
03:00:55,810 --> 03:00:57,290
"with the dragon scales included,

4135

"We’ll call it even, 39,000 gold."

4137
03:01:04,080 --> 03:01:04,640
PERCY: Fair.

4138
03:01:04,640 --> 03:01:06,590
VEX: That wasn’t much of a discount, Gilmore.

4139
03:01:06,590 --> 03:01:09,560
VAX: Hush up, Vex’ahlia.

4140
03:01:09,560 --> 03:01:11,790
VAX: Done, sold, thank you.

4141
03:01:13,010 --> 03:01:14,660
VAX: With our thanks.

4142
03:01:22,370 --> 03:01:27,570
GILMORE: "So minus the platinum, that’s 22,000 gold pieces

4143
03:01:27,570 --> 03:01:29,450
"after the platinum and dragon scales."

4144
03:01:29,820 --> 03:01:31,650
KEYLETH: And we have that, right?

4145
03:01:32,330 --> 03:01:37,070
GILMORE: "And you have 25,000 gold credit if you’d like."

4146
03:01:37,070 --> 03:01:41,310
VEX: We have, hold on... gotta go away for a minute.

4147
03:01:43,380 --> 03:01:45,150
VAX: We’re passing on the credit, Gilmore.

4148
03:01:45,150 --> 03:01:46,980
VEX: We have plenty left.

4149
03:01:46,980 --> 03:01:47,570
VAX: Yes.

4150
03:01:47,570 --> 03:01:48,930
PERCY: All right.

4151
03:01:48,930 --> 03:01:51,140
LIAM: You guys are a black screen, what happened?

4152
03:01:51,140 --> 03:01:51,640
TALIESIN: They paused it.

4153
03:01:51,640 --> 03:01:54,110
LAURA: I was looking at my calculator.

4154
03:01:54,110 --> 03:01:55,980
LIAM: All right, we hear you. There you are!

4155
03:01:56,210 --> 03:01:57,310
ORION: Abacus!

4156
03:01:58,450 --> 03:02:02,480
VAX: You’re so dark sometimes, Vex’ahlia. I swear.

4157
03:02:02,480 --> 03:02:04,210
VEX: So the total was 20,000

4158
03:02:04,210 --> 03:02:06,440
minus the platinum and the dragon scales?

4159
03:02:06,440 --> 03:02:08,000
GILMORE: "Twenty-two thousand."

4160
03:02:08,340 --> 03:02:10,420
VEX: Yes, we still have enough, so.

4161
03:02:12,000 --> 03:02:13,850
GILMORE: "All right. So a deal?"

4162
03:02:14,360 --> 03:02:15,410
KEYLETH: Deal!

4163
03:02:15,410 --> 03:02:16,300
PERCY: Deal.

4164
03:02:16,300 --> 03:02:18,300
VEX: My god, all of our money’s gone.

4165
03:02:18,300 --> 03:02:20,300
MATT: He snaps his fingers,

4166
03:02:20,300 --> 03:02:22,770
Sherri comes and presents all the items that she had currently

4167
03:02:22,770 --> 03:02:25,300
in a little stowaway bin off to the side of the desk.

4168
03:02:25,810 --> 03:02:26,850
Brings them out to the rest of you

4169
03:02:26,850 --> 03:02:27,950
and places it on the counter.

4170
03:02:27,950 --> 03:02:30,050
Gilmore immediately snaps his fingers

4171
03:02:30,050 --> 03:02:32,350
and a contract shows up.

4172
03:02:32,350 --> 03:02:34,830
He writes up the numbers exchanged,

4173
03:02:34,830 --> 03:02:38,060
making note of his business, passes it out.

4174
03:02:38,060 --> 03:02:39,490
GILMORE: "Please sign here.

4175

"Sign here and present the money."

4177
03:02:46,220 --> 03:02:47,660
VEX: I guess I’ll do that.

4178
03:02:47,660 --> 03:02:48,450
PERCY: You do that.

4179
03:02:49,180 --> 03:02:49,930
GILMORE: "Vex’ahlia."

4180
03:02:49,930 --> 03:02:51,640
MATT: He hands you a quill.

4181
03:02:52,690 --> 03:02:55,810
Takes your coin, slides you,

4182
03:02:55,810 --> 03:02:59,660
and you now have this entire batch of magical items

4183
03:02:59,660 --> 03:03:00,690
LAURA: That’s pretty cool.
MATT: to distribute as you see fit.

4184
03:03:00,690 --> 03:03:02,130
MATT: to distribute as you see fit.

4185
03:03:02,130 --> 03:03:04,410
MARISHA: Yes! New armor!

4186
03:03:04,720 --> 03:03:05,660
MATT: And from that point --

4187
03:03:05,660 --> 03:03:08,140
LAURA: Make sure we get some of those things.

4188
03:03:10,120 --> 03:03:11,780
GILMORE: "An absolute pleasure

4189
03:03:11,780 --> 03:03:14,520
"doing business with all of you. Absolutely."

4190
03:03:14,520 --> 03:03:15,460
KEYLETH: Thank you, Gilmore.

4191
03:03:15,460 --> 03:03:17,310
GILMORE: "Thank you."

4192
03:03:17,310 --> 03:03:21,770
KEYLETH: So really though. Will this transfer to that?

4193
03:03:21,770 --> 03:03:23,120
GILMORE: "I have no idea."

4194
03:03:24,930 --> 03:03:27,020
KEYLETH: I was wanting to ask you, Gilmore.

4195
03:03:27,790 --> 03:03:31,760
Have you considered maybe doing potion-making workshops?

4196
03:03:33,880 --> 03:03:35,100
GILMORE: "Hm. I’ll put some thought to that."

4197
03:03:35,100 --> 03:03:36,510
KEYLETH: Okay. Let me know.

4198
03:03:36,510 --> 03:03:37,120
GILMORE: "All right."

4199
03:03:37,940 --> 03:03:39,950
LAURA: I feel very uncomfortable and I leave.

4200
03:03:39,950 --> 03:03:41,890
I go outside to hang out with Trinket.

4201
03:03:42,810 --> 03:03:43,560
MATT: Okay.

4202
03:03:44,430 --> 03:03:47,250
MATT: As Gilmore takes the change behind the counter, he goes,

4203
03:03:47,250 --> 03:03:50,430
GILMORE: "I’ve got a bit more business to do here.

4204
03:03:51,290 --> 03:03:55,930
"Vax, I greatly appreciate spending the afternoon with you.

"Where are you staying?"

4206
03:03:59,330 --> 03:04:02,360
LIAM: I take him by the hand, do one of these clasps, and say,

4207
03:04:02,820 --> 03:04:05,070
VAX: We live here now, we’re residents.

4208
03:04:05,070 --> 03:04:06,380
I haven’t had time to tell you.

4209
03:04:06,380 --> 03:04:09,080
We have a keep, our own keep. You should come visit.

4210
03:04:09,780 --> 03:04:12,100
It’s on the outskirts of town. It’s called Greyskull Keep,

4211
03:04:12,100 --> 03:04:13,680
and you’re welcome any time.

4212

GILMORE: "Good to know.

"All right. To business I go. I bid you all a fine farewell."

PERCY: Adieu.

KEYLETH: Bye, Gilmore.

4217
03:04:24,510 --> 03:04:30,050
MATT: He goes back through his beaded exit to the back room

4218
03:04:30,620 --> 03:04:32,960
and leaves you to the rest of your--

03:04:32,960 --> 03:04:34,060
--at which point Sherri goes,

4220
03:04:35,900 --> 03:04:37,790
SHERRI: "I’ll get back to work."

4221
03:04:38,300 --> 03:04:39,330
MATT: She goes back up,

4222
03:04:39,330 --> 03:04:40,940
leaving you guys alone in the main chamber

4223
03:04:40,940 --> 03:04:43,250
as a couple of other customers start walking around.

4224
03:04:45,480 --> 03:04:49,260
MATT: I think we’ll call that the adventure for the evening.

4225
03:04:49,420 --> 03:04:50,970
MARISHA: Thanks for watching us shop.

4226
03:04:50,970 --> 03:04:51,810
ASHLEY: Thanks for watching us shop!

4227
03:04:51,810 --> 03:04:53,160
LAURA: All the money’s gone!

4228
03:04:53,160 --> 03:04:55,560
MATT: All the money’s gone. You spent it, guys.

4229
03:04:55,560 --> 03:04:57,820
MARISHA: We have 25 waiting for us in Kraghammer.

4230
03:04:57,820 --> 03:04:59,020
MATT: That’s true, you didn’t open the line of credit.

4231
03:04:59,020 --> 03:04:59,660
LAURA: Yeah, we’d better get that.

4232
03:04:59,660 --> 03:05:02,900
MARISHA: At least we’re not in debt.

4233
03:05:02,900 --> 03:05:06,040
LIAM: The world is full of money, Vex'halia.

4234
03:05:07,180 --> 03:05:08,990
TRAVIS: We got more money?

4235
03:05:08,990 --> 03:05:10,810
ASHLEY: Who had dibs on what?

4236
03:05:11,440 --> 03:05:13,840
TALIESIN: I wanted the dexterity boost

4237
03:05:13,840 --> 03:05:15,320
and I was thinking of the mithral.

4238
03:05:15,730 --> 03:05:18,160
MARISHA: And I want the leather armor and he wants the cape.

4239
03:05:20,100 --> 03:05:21,760
ASHLEY: I can't use the sword, right?

4240
03:05:22,800 --> 03:05:24,120
The frostband sword?

4241
03:05:24,510 --> 03:05:25,790
LIAM: No, clerics can't use swords.

4242
03:05:25,790 --> 03:05:28,270
MATT: Check on your class, you might have access to it.

4243
03:05:29,880 --> 03:05:30,900
Let me check here for you real fast.

4244
03:05:30,900 --> 03:05:35,360
LIAM: It used to be just blunt weapons for clerics, wasn't it?

4245
03:05:35,360 --> 03:05:37,700
MATT: That's the older version, they've changed a few things.

4246
03:05:37,700 --> 03:05:38,970
They don't do it too often. Let me double-check.

4247
03:05:38,970 --> 03:05:42,990
Cleric has access to all simple weapons.

4248
03:05:47,120 --> 03:05:49,920
The sword is a martial weapon so you cannot use that as a weapon.

4249
03:05:49,920 --> 03:05:50,690
ASHLEY: That's okay.

4250
03:05:53,060 --> 03:05:56,160
ZAC: Oh man. These donations tonight, guys.

4251
03:05:56,160 --> 03:06:00,480
MATT: That's great. I'm glad you guys are enjoying watching our--

4252
03:06:00,480 --> 03:06:02,190
LAURA: Me and Travis are going to cut out.

4253
03:06:02,190 --> 03:06:03,840
MATT: -- Laura and Travis are taking off, guys.

4254
03:06:03,840 --> 03:06:06,200
MARISHA: Bye guys, have fun in Florida!

4255
03:06:06,200 --> 03:06:08,000
LIAM: We were so glad to have you, sister!

4256
03:06:08,000 --> 03:06:09,900
LAURA: We were so glad to be here.

4257
03:06:11,810 --> 03:06:13,800
MARISHA: What con are you guys at?

4258
03:06:17,100 --> 03:06:19,360
LAURA: We're at MetroCon, down in Tampa.

4259
03:06:19,360 --> 03:06:21,530
MATT: MetroCon in Tampa. So if you guys want to go see

4260
03:06:21,530 --> 03:06:24,000
Vex and Grog in person and you're in the Florida/Tampa area,

4261
03:06:24,000 --> 03:06:25,380
go to MetroCon this weekend and say hi.

4262
03:06:25,380 --> 03:06:28,000
LAURA: Let's see how tired we are tomorrow.
MARISHA: MetroCon in Tampa.

4263
03:06:29,310 --> 03:06:29,980
LIAM: Worth it.

4264
03:06:29,980 --> 03:06:30,930
MATT: Thank you guys.

4265
03:06:30,930 --> 03:06:31,650
MARISHA: Have fun!

4266
03:06:33,840 --> 03:06:36,330
MATT: Thanks again for the chat that bought us dinner tonight,

4267
03:06:36,330 --> 03:06:37,760
it was amazing and delicious.

4268
03:06:37,760 --> 03:06:39,760
Thank you so much guys, you're amazing every week.

4269
03:06:41,610 --> 03:06:42,740
So we're going to go to donations.

4270
03:06:42,740 --> 03:06:43,470
ZAC: Let's get through these.

4271
03:06:43,470 --> 03:06:46,250
MATT: Yeah, all right. Thank you guys again for --

4272
03:06:46,250 --> 03:06:50,030
Once again, this was the recovery episode

4273
03:06:50,030 --> 03:06:53,870
of a long, twelve-week battle through the underdark.

4274
03:06:53,870 --> 03:06:56,450
This was interesting to come back to, I hope you enjoyed it.

4275
03:06:56,450 --> 03:06:57,700
All right, so first, donations.
