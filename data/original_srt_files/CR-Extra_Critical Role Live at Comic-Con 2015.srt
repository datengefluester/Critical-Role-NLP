1
00:00:04,155 --> 00:00:09,194
MATT: Hello, ladies and gentlemen! Thank you all
for coming to our silly little Critical Role panel

2
00:00:09,258 --> 00:00:11,887
this afternoon. How's everyone feeling this
Thursday afternoon?

3
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:14,367
(cheering)

4
00:00:14,367 --> 00:00:17,475
MATT: That makes me happy.

5
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:19,066
OFF-SCREEN: I love you!

6
00:00:19,066 --> 00:00:25,555
MATT: Oh my god, I love you, too! Getting here was
an adventure, but we're here. It's been a

7
00:00:25,555 --> 00:00:29,832
delightfully chaotic start to Comic-Con, as I
think we've all kind of experienced, but let's go

8
00:00:29,832 --> 00:00:35,131
ahead and get this panel on the road, work it
forward. First introduction here to our fantastic

9
00:00:35,131 --> 00:00:38,891
human gunslinger of the party, Taliesin Jaffe as
Percy!

10
00:00:38,891 --> 00:00:46,311
(cheering)

11
00:00:46,341 --> 00:00:50,852
MATT: Following up on that, we have our
delightfully awkward but extremely powerful

12
00:00:50,852 --> 00:00:55,152
half-elf druid, Keyleth, played by Marisha Ray!

13
00:00:55,152 --> 00:00:59,323
(cheering)

14
00:00:59,323 --> 00:01:04,092
MATT: Currently rocking a clay sculpture that a
fan made of the airboat in past episodes, so

15
00:01:04,092 --> 00:01:14,355
that's awesome. Coming up next, we have our sly,
charismatic, and wink-inducing ranger, Vex, played

16
00:01:14,355 --> 00:01:16,380
by Laura Bailey! Come on stage.

17
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,832
(cheering)

18
00:01:20,832 --> 00:01:26,884
MATT: Wherever you'd like. Following that-- oh,
stop taking pictures, Tiberius. We have our

19
00:01:26,884 --> 00:01:31,003
dragonborn sorcerer, Tiberius, played by Orion
Acaba. Come on stage, buddy.

20
00:01:31,003 --> 00:01:36,845
(cheering)

21
00:01:36,845 --> 00:01:41,774
MATT: I figured if someone would hit the couch, it
would probably be you, so well done. Following

22
00:01:41,774 --> 00:01:47,168
that, we have the twin brother to our fantastic
ranger here, the other dangerous, stealthy

23
00:01:47,168 --> 00:01:51,776
half-elf rogue, Vax, played by Liam O'Brien. Come
on up, buddy.

24
00:01:51,776 --> 00:01:57,214
(cheering)

25
00:01:57,214 --> 00:02:02,046
MATT: And rounding out the rest of our forum here,
we have the extremely strong in the body, not so

26
00:02:02,046 --> 00:02:09,404
much the mind, goliath barbarian, played by Travis
Willingham, Grog!

27
00:02:09,404 --> 00:02:14,574
(cheering)

28
00:02:14,574 --> 00:02:18,904
MATT: Hi, guys. I myself, I am your humble dungeon
master, Matthew Mercer. Thank you very much for

29
00:02:18,904 --> 00:02:27,644
coming. I guess I'll go ahead and I'll take a seat
over here. We'll share mics, we've got a mic here,

30
00:02:27,644 --> 00:02:33,593
we've got a mic there, and Orion's rocking the
front stage. There you go! It's nap time for

31
00:02:33,593 --> 00:02:37,803
Orion. All right, so I guess we'll begin with a--

32
00:02:37,803 --> 00:02:39,664
What the heck?!

33
00:02:39,664 --> 00:03:00,737
(screaming and cheering)

34
00:03:00,737 --> 00:03:08,944
MATT: You guys did this. No, I had no idea! All
right, so we didn't know she was here. We thought

35
00:03:08,944 --> 00:03:17,985
she was in New York, away forever. These are real
tears, ladies and gentlemen. Oh my god, that's

36
00:03:17,985 --> 00:03:20,699
amazing. We've got more mics, perfect!

37
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:24,215
MARISHA: Ashley, what are you doing here?

38
00:03:24,215 --> 00:03:37,977
ASHLEY: Oh hey, Grog. Hi! It's a long story, I'll
tell you guys after.

39
00:03:37,977 --> 00:03:41,408
MATT: Well, I'm glad you could make it.

40
00:03:41,408 --> 00:03:44,001
ASHLEY: Hey, I'm glad to be here.

41
00:03:44,001 --> 00:03:48,019
MATT: Everybody, this is Ashley Johnson, our
wonderful cleric, Pike.

42
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:55,757
(cheering)

43
00:03:55,757 --> 00:04:00,867
MATT: All right, wow, so after that emotional
moment. So, for those of you who don't know, we

44
00:04:00,867 --> 00:04:07,307
are Critical Role. We're a bunch of voice actors,
actors that have been playing Dungeons and Dragons

45
00:04:07,307 --> 00:04:13,257
together for going on almost three years, now. And
we recently had the pleasure to be approached by

46
00:04:13,257 --> 00:04:19,277
Geek and Sundry to have us begin bringing our
wondrous little personal adventure out to you guys

47
00:04:19,277 --> 00:04:25,718
via their Twitch channel. And we've done 16 episodes
so far, and the outpouring of appreciation for it

48
00:04:25,718 --> 00:04:30,977
and the connection we've made with you guys in the
community has been absolutely electric and

49
00:04:30,977 --> 00:04:35,436
amazing. I think all of us agree with that,
definitely. But yeah, it's been a really

50
00:04:35,436 --> 00:04:40,459
interesting journey. Let's go down on the end here
and talk a little bit about ourselves and what we

51
00:04:40,459 --> 00:04:43,388
do and how we got pulled into this craziness.

52
00:04:43,388 --> 00:04:44,884
TALIESIN: Oh god, I've got to start? Really?

53
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:48,299
MARISHA: I mean, everyone's voice actors, so we
can get that out of the way, right?

54
00:04:48,299 --> 00:04:54,525
LIAM: Probably also talk about how you got into
D&D, at what point in your life. Add that in.

55
00:04:54,525 --> 00:05:00,378
TALIESIN: Okay, I can do that. That's much more
interesting than voice acting. My name is Taliesin

56
00:05:00,378 --> 00:05:08,381
Jaffe. I got into roleplaying in high school
with-- well, I had funny hair and wore a lot of

57
00:05:08,381 --> 00:05:15,685
black, so I played Vampire the Masquerade. And I
LARPed. I was a big LARPer, for those-- I don't

58
00:05:15,685 --> 00:05:23,198
think I have to explain that. And had a group of
friends in high school, and we would do everything

59
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:31,398
from weird games, like we played GURPs and Rifts
and Cyberpunk and all those games in the early

60
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:36,959
90s, late 80s. And it had a been a while for me,
and then I got pulled into a completely different

61
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:42,371
game with Matt and a few friends of ours, so we
played for about a year and a half, and then we'll

62
00:05:42,371 --> 00:05:49,329
get to the story of Liam's game, but I got pulled
into the game that was the first game, and it has

63
00:05:49,329 --> 00:05:53,157
ruined me for every other game I could possibly
want to play.

64
00:05:53,157 --> 00:06:00,292
MARISHA: Yes, I guess I first got into tabletop
roleplaying in particular with Matt. Matt was

65
00:06:00,292 --> 00:06:08,651
actually my first DM six, seven years ago,
approximately. And I've had other games, I was a

66
00:06:08,651 --> 00:06:16,160
part of a Buffy the Vampire Slayer tabletop RPG,
which was super fun. Yup. It's a good game. I was

67
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:24,800
a pyromancer, it was awesome. I will say, though,
once you have Matt, it's hard to go back. Once you

68
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,041
go Matt, you can't go back. It works. Shut up,
don't judge me, Travis.

69
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,962
MATT: That's not becoming a t-shirt.

70
00:06:31,962 --> 00:06:35,199
OFF-SCREEN: Yes, it is!

71
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:45,471
MARISHA: Chris, hi! How are you? I didn't see you.
Oh, and it's Erika! Hi, you guys!

72
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:47,051
ORION: Okay, how about you, Laura?

73
00:06:47,051 --> 00:07:01,231
LAURA: Oh, hey. Oh, hi guys. Hi, I'm Laura Bailey.
RPGs, huh? So the first time I ever played pencil

74
00:07:01,231 --> 00:07:09,974
and paper RPG was with this group, because of that
guy. I always played RPGs, like I'm a big video

75
00:07:09,974 --> 00:07:18,191
game fan, I'm a geek for that, and yeah, and so I
always chose RPGs as what I wanted to play, so

76
00:07:18,191 --> 00:07:24,042
surprisingly, it wasn't anything new for me once
we started playing. I fell into it really, really

77
00:07:24,042 --> 00:07:27,343
fast, because I was accustomed to all of that.

78
00:07:27,343 --> 00:07:28,929
LIAM: Some would say instantly.

79
00:07:28,929 --> 00:07:35,491
LAURA: Insta. It was so much fun. It was only
supposed to be a one-off game, when we started

80
00:07:35,491 --> 00:07:41,443
this, and we all had so much fun playing together
that it was like, we can't stop this. When's the

81
00:07:41,443 --> 00:07:46,240
next time we can get together and do it again and
again and again? Yeah, it was epic.

82
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,173
LIAM: The longer version of that story, for
anybody who doesn't know it, is several years

83
00:07:52,173 --> 00:07:52,902
ago--

84
00:07:52,902 --> 00:07:54,173
ORION: That's Liam O'Brien, everybody.

85
00:07:54,173 --> 00:08:02,253
LIAM: Oh hi, I'm Liam O'Brien. Hi. Just so happy.
Several years ago, I was directing Matt for the

86
00:08:02,253 --> 00:08:06,872
first time for a game. We knew each other, but not
as well as we do now, and he would come in, and

87
00:08:06,872 --> 00:08:11,352
every time he came in, like a drug pusher, be
like, "You should come. We could do a one-off, I

88
00:08:11,352 --> 00:08:14,232
"could play with you. You played when you were
younger. We should play together."

89
00:08:14,232 --> 00:08:20,355
MATT: Hey, man, roll some dice. It'll be fun. What
could possibly happen? I won't tell your parents.

90
00:08:20,355 --> 00:08:26,903
LIAM: And I refused every time, I said, "Oh,
that'd be great, but I got brand-new kids," 'cause

91
00:08:26,903 --> 00:08:31,826
I had brand-new kids. And then fast-forward to
several years later, where Sam Riegel, who's not

92
00:08:31,826 --> 00:08:38,964
here, and I do a dorky podcast, and we do
something dorky every time, and I thought, one

93
00:08:38,964 --> 00:08:46,788
time, we'll play a pen and paper roleplaying game,
and we asked these yahoos, and we played the game,

94
00:08:46,788 --> 00:08:51,775
and it was a blast, and then everyone left and I
went home that night and went, "Oh man. That was

95
00:08:51,775 --> 00:08:59,511
"so good. How do I tell them I want to do it
again?" And I sent out an e-mail and nobody

96
00:08:59,511 --> 00:09:02,188
responded for a long time.

97
00:09:02,188 --> 00:09:05,115
LAURA: That is true, actually, yeah.

98
00:09:05,115 --> 00:09:10,037
LIAM: Couple of days, so I felt like I had a big
red N on my forehead, but then the answers

99
00:09:10,037 --> 00:09:13,800
trickled in and we kept playing, and now we're
here and there's a baseball field behind us!

100
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,342
(cheering)

101
00:09:16,342 --> 00:09:17,817
MATT: Take that, sports.

102
00:09:17,817 --> 00:09:20,588
LAURA: Yeah, sportsball.

103
00:09:20,588 --> 00:09:26,683
ASHLEY: I shouldn't do that. What they do here is
really awesome.

104
00:09:26,683 --> 00:09:28,841
MATT: No, this is great.

105
00:09:28,841 --> 00:09:38,021
ASHLEY: Yeah, I got involved because of this guy.
They had already played a game, one game, and then

106
00:09:38,021 --> 00:09:45,855
I remember we had a party for a friend of ours,
Troy Baker. It was his birthday, and you guys were

107
00:09:45,855 --> 00:09:54,568
talking about it. And I was like, "Oh, dang, I
want to play!" And then we started and we were

108
00:09:54,568 --> 00:09:59,555
putting our character sheets together, and then I
sent you, I was like, "Yeah, I think my name

109
00:09:59,555 --> 00:10:07,028
"should be, I don't know, Pike Trickfoot?" You were
so helpful and emailing me back. Then the first

110
00:10:07,028 --> 00:10:11,814
game, because I'd never really played anything like
this before. And I'm sure you guys can tell in the

111
00:10:11,814 --> 00:10:18,016
game, I'm always like, wait, what is this? Or,
what does this mean? I was in awe of everybody,

112
00:10:18,016 --> 00:10:23,916
because they were doing voices, and I was trying
to keep up, but I couldn't really. And I was like,

113
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:31,491
I want to do this all the time. Every night. Can
we? And then we started doing it all the time.

114
00:10:31,491 --> 00:10:37,747
Honestly, some of the best nights of my life have
been from this game.

115
00:10:37,747 --> 00:10:39,403
OFF-SCREEN: Love you, Ashley!

116
00:10:39,403 --> 00:10:40,815
ASHLEY: Love you.

117
00:10:40,815 --> 00:10:43,214
MATT: Orion?

118
00:10:43,214 --> 00:10:47,336
TRAVIS: Oh, you? Me? Hi!

119
00:10:47,336 --> 00:10:49,577
LAURA: Hi.

120
00:10:49,577 --> 00:10:59,059
TRAVIS: I'm Travis. I play Grog. Super smart. I
never played any--

121
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:00,468
LAURA: Also, ale.

122
00:11:00,468 --> 00:11:07,977
TRAVIS: Huh? Also, ale. I never played any RPGs
before this, but I had asked around our little

123
00:11:07,977 --> 00:11:14,296
voice actor community for years, like Yuri
Lowenthal and Liam and Matt Mercer. I think the

124
00:11:14,296 --> 00:11:18,936
first time I asked you about it was on a mo-cap
session. I was like, "I hear you do the Master of

125
00:11:18,936 --> 00:11:24,848
"Dungeonings, what does that look like?" And he
started to tell me, and I couldn't concentrate on

126
00:11:24,848 --> 00:11:30,506
anything beside the fact that I wanted to do it.
Then Liam had that birthday party, and I came 20

127
00:11:30,506 --> 00:11:36,999
minutes late. I walked in to Laura being extremely
posh and bargaining with somebody for something.

128
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:43,945
Liam was going, "Yes, of course. Oh, hello, sir."
I was terrified. I think Matt had said, "Just

129
00:11:43,945 --> 00:11:49,946
"prepare your class and your race." I said,
"Goliath barbarian."He goes, "Okay, so what's your

130
00:11:49,946 --> 00:11:58,399
"name?" I was like, "Um. Grog." He was, "Grog, what
do you do?" I was like, "I make fine leather

131
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:07,050
"boots." He goes, "Okay, bootmaker Grog," and we
were off to the races. But that has led us to

132
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,837
this, somehow.

133
00:12:08,837 --> 00:12:24,790
ORION: Greetings and salutations, everyone. I'm
Orion Acaba. I'm a voice actor. Did you guys--?

134
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:41,499
Okay. That's enough, Keyleth. I'm a big Magic The
Gathering guy. Also with Travis and Laura, I

135
00:12:41,499 --> 00:12:50,114
hadn't played D&D before Liam's birthday. He was
like, "Hey, we're doing this D&D thing." I was

136
00:12:50,114 --> 00:13:03,272
like, "D&D. Okay." I've known Liam the longest.
Maybe you the longest, but he's like a brother to

137
00:13:03,272 --> 00:13:11,830
me, so I'll do whatever. I was like, "Yeah, I can
play and stuff." That led to a bond and a

138
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:17,341
friendship and experience that I can't replicate
or pay any money or do anything to even compare to

139
00:13:17,341 --> 00:13:23,907
anything else to. This game has literally become
the most important thing and most fun thing in my

140
00:13:23,907 --> 00:13:32,861
life. Every week. Through time and bullshitting
around, we'd find and tweeted stuff and randomly

141
00:13:32,861 --> 00:13:40,677
in our privacy of our own game, and fucking now
we're-- what the fuck is going on?

142
00:13:40,677 --> 00:13:45,799
LIAM: Let's play ball!

143
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:59,744
ORION: Scanlan sends his regards as he's too busy
fucking whores. Oh, that's right. Sorry, everyone.

144
00:13:59,744 --> 00:14:03,434
Matthew Mercer is great. Now you talk.

145
00:14:03,434 --> 00:14:13,792
(cheering)

146
00:14:13,792 --> 00:14:24,083
MATT: You have disadvantage for the remainder of
the panel. Yeah, that's the story of how it all came

147
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:33,753
together. There are few things I enjoy more than
having people converse with me and say like, "I'm

148
00:14:33,753 --> 00:14:37,663
"interested in role-playing games, but I don't know
how they work or what they're about. I hear it's a

149
00:14:37,663 --> 00:14:45,253
"weird thing." And I'm like, "Well, kind of, but
the best kind of weird." Knowing that, once these

150
00:14:45,253 --> 00:14:49,504
people, especially being geared towards
performance arts and putting ourselves in a

151
00:14:49,504 --> 00:14:53,204
different place mentally for a lot of our job,
it'll be an easy transition for them to get into

152
00:14:53,204 --> 00:15:00,042
it, watching them all suddenly click. That moment
of, oh, I can do anything. Yes. Well, you can try

153
00:15:00,042 --> 00:15:06,603
anything. That doesn't mean you'll do it, but you
can certainly try. But yeah, it's been an absolute

154
00:15:06,603 --> 00:15:11,485
wonderful joy watching this game grow and the
community grow since we started the stream, and

155
00:15:11,485 --> 00:15:18,616
yeah, it's probably one of my favorite things,
period, ever in my life so far. The fact that we

156
00:15:18,616 --> 00:15:21,944
get to share it with you guys now is even more
amazing, and you guys have been incredible this

157
00:15:21,944 --> 00:15:24,321
entire journey, so thank you for that, guys,
sincerely.

158
00:15:24,321 --> 00:15:27,874
(cheering)

159
00:15:27,874 --> 00:15:32,099
LAURA: It's amazing the amount of times that we've
had conversations because when you're playing a

160
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:39,885
game, we all see it as real. We've lived those
experiences for so long that that world exists and

161
00:15:39,885 --> 00:15:45,204
our characters exist and those experiences exist,
but only between us, and then as soon as we were

162
00:15:45,204 --> 00:15:50,698
able to bring it to Geek and Sundry, and now you
guys are taking part in it too, all of a sudden

163
00:15:50,698 --> 00:16:00,334
it's a real thing, if that makes any sense, to
know that you guys know who Percy is

164
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:05,616
is phenomenal, and that anybody loves Trinket as much
as I do. That means so much!

165
00:16:05,616 --> 00:16:11,463
LIAM: It's like we were all quietly, privately
going crazy when we were just playing a game, but

166
00:16:11,463 --> 00:16:18,054
now you guys are saying the weird whispers that we
heard in our head. You're parroting them back to

167
00:16:18,054 --> 00:16:21,328
us. We're like, "Oh, Percy is real! He's real! I
know he's real!"

168
00:16:21,328 --> 00:16:23,874
LAURA: We're all going to be insane in the next
five years, I know it.

169
00:16:23,874 --> 00:16:29,227
MARISHA: Yeah, it does feel like being the little
kid who's like, "No, there's a monster under our

170
00:16:29,227 --> 00:16:34,709
"bed." And everyone was like, "Oh yeah. No, you're
right. There totally is a monster kicking it under

171
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:39,376
"there." And you're like, "What?! They see it
too?!" And I feel like that's true every time we

172
00:16:39,376 --> 00:16:44,323
get a piece of fanart that comes in, because I
know personally I was afraid-- I was like, I hope

173
00:16:44,323 --> 00:16:50,619
this story translates. I hope what we see they can
see. But every time we see a piece of fanart or

174
00:16:50,619 --> 00:16:56,414
anything like that, it's like, oh yeah, no,
that's-- yep, that's Gilmore. Holy shit. They see

175
00:16:56,414 --> 00:16:58,044
it too!

176
00:16:58,044 --> 00:17:04,656
MATT: And on that note, too, the fanart, the
letters, the recently penned Critmas that has

177
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:12,403
happened a few times, it's a strange experience,
because for us, just a humility standpoint, it's

178
00:17:12,403 --> 00:17:19,956
like, why are they buying us things? They don't
need to do that! But it becomes this wonderful

179
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:24,146
connection point where we get the opportunity
through that to also realize how much it means to

180
00:17:24,146 --> 00:17:28,029
other people through these letters and these
people that donate to our charity, 826LA, by the

181
00:17:28,029 --> 00:17:29,636
way, which is an amazing charity.

182
00:17:29,636 --> 00:17:32,232
(cheering)

183
00:17:32,232 --> 00:17:36,887
MATT: You guys have done an amazing job helping us
support that, too. And it's been a really, really

184
00:17:36,887 --> 00:17:40,722
incredible experience to know that something that
means so much to us also is starting to mean so

185
00:17:40,722 --> 00:17:43,627
much to other people as well, and it's amazing.

186
00:17:43,627 --> 00:17:47,127
LIAM: It's nice to have a show about D&D, huh?

187
00:17:47,127 --> 00:17:51,199
(cheering)

188
00:17:51,199 --> 00:17:56,059
MATT: We're having this strange tabletop
renaissance now, where you used to keep that stuff

189
00:17:56,059 --> 00:18:01,257
close to your chest, you'd mention, "Yeah, I play
Dungeons and Dragons," you'd be kind of quiet

190
00:18:01,257 --> 00:18:04,943
about it. Now we can say it a little more proudly,
and as opposed to people saying, "Yeah, D&D,

191
00:18:04,943 --> 00:18:08,619
"that's nerd stuff!" they're like, "Cool, when do
you play?"

192
00:18:08,619 --> 00:18:15,409
ORION: Yeah, I have to say, one of my favorite
aspects of what this is, is we have-- and I said

193
00:18:15,409 --> 00:18:20,960
this to one of our fans, I signed something for
her-- is Travis is one of my favorite things about

194
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:32,352
the show. Tiberius is my favorite thing about the
show. But Travis as a human being, there's a lot

195
00:18:32,352 --> 00:18:41,579
of-- it breaks down those stupid walls where it's
like, no, it's not a bunch of introverts in

196
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:50,945
somebody's basement. We have a big, hulking mass
of a man, you know? That can beat all of us up.

197
00:18:50,945 --> 00:18:56,210
And he's there being as big of a geek as we are.
And it breaks down the thing where women can't

198
00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:02,969
play, because you have these three gorgeous,
badass women kicking ass and also playing Dungeons

199
00:19:02,969 --> 00:19:06,720
and Dragons. A lot of great things about this show
that I love.

200
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:18,718
ASHLEY: I remember I was introducing you to a
friend of mine, and completely out of context, I

201
00:19:18,718 --> 00:19:24,613
was like-- and this was still when it was kind of
new, and I was like, "Oh! This is Matt, he's my

202
00:19:24,613 --> 00:19:31,830
"dungeon master." And then I kept moving on, and
they looked at me, and I was like, "Oh, wow, that

203
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,838
"sounded really weird."

204
00:19:33,838 --> 00:19:37,745
MATT: What you didn't see was me the whole time
behind you going like--

205
00:19:37,745 --> 00:19:40,549
(laughter)

206
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:46,001
ASHLEY: I was like, "What I mean is, we play D&D,
that sounded so not what it is."

207
00:19:46,001 --> 00:19:48,365
MATT: I can show you the velvet room if you like.

208
00:19:48,365 --> 00:19:50,867
TRAVIS: Matt pulls out a d20, he's like, "Roll
it."

209
00:19:50,867 --> 00:19:52,931
(laughter)

210
00:19:52,931 --> 00:19:55,733
LAURA: Mr. Mercer's been waiting for you.

211
00:19:55,733 --> 00:20:03,125
MATT: I'd forgotten about that. Well, before we get to
the Q&A session, is there anything else you guys

212
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:06,960
wanted to talk about here, particularly while
we're on a baseball field talking about Dungeons

213
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,026
and Dragons?

214
00:20:08,026 --> 00:20:09,298
TRAVIS: We're on a baseball field!

215
00:20:09,298 --> 00:20:11,596
(cheering)

216
00:20:11,596 --> 00:20:16,169
TRAVIS: Stand up if you're wearing one of our
amazing Critical Role shirts, because they're all

217
00:20:16,169 --> 00:20:23,808
over the place. (counting) That's amazing. We love
you. We love you for buying those! It's insane

218
00:20:23,808 --> 00:20:25,848
that you have them and we love you.

219
00:20:25,848 --> 00:20:32,463
MATT: We have original generation, we have the
second generation release, too. We have the new

220
00:20:32,463 --> 00:20:36,789
generation, which, by the way, the new red shirts
you see with the Critical Role logo, designed by

221
00:20:36,789 --> 00:20:39,758
Taliesin Jaffe over here, Percy designed those
himself.

222
00:20:39,758 --> 00:20:53,769
ASHLEY: I was wearing my shirt on the plane, but
then I dropped my cinnamon roll with-- you guys

223
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:57,019
can probably tell on the show, I'm constantly
eating, because I'm always hungry.

224
00:20:57,019 --> 00:20:58,518
ORION: So that was a cinnamon roll fail?

225
00:20:58,518 --> 00:21:06,467
ASHLEY: Yeah, but it was a cinnamon roll, and it
was a Cinnabon with the fresh sauce. All right, I

226
00:21:06,467 --> 00:21:08,286
can't wear this to the panel.

227
00:21:08,286 --> 00:21:10,736
MATT: We wouldn't have judged.

228
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:15,639
TALIESIN: I love that today seven people have come
up to me with this intense look in their eyes, and

229
00:21:15,639 --> 00:21:22,280
they've come up to me very quietly and been like,
"Hey. Briarwoods, man. Wow. Wow."

230
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,555
(laughter)

231
00:21:24,555 --> 00:21:34,829
TALIESIN: This is weird private issues in my life
that I'm like, "Yeah, I know! Wow!" It is fabulous

232
00:21:34,829 --> 00:21:38,691
to finally have an audience. We've been playing in
this little room knowing that there are people

233
00:21:38,691 --> 00:21:40,819
there in theory, but to actually--

234
00:21:40,819 --> 00:21:47,414
MARISHA: It's kind of like a reality show, but
we're not putting ourselves through the wringer,

235
00:21:47,414 --> 00:21:50,239
we're putting our characters through it, so it's
great.

236
00:21:50,239 --> 00:21:52,700
TALIESIN: Better them than us.

237
00:21:52,700 --> 00:22:01,900
TRAVIS: People going, "Oh, Keyleth's mom, man,"
you're like, "Yeah. Wait, what?" Right, that's a

238
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,275
real thing. That's a real thing!

239
00:22:03,275 --> 00:22:06,451
MARISHA: I will say-- no, you.

240
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:08,882
LAURA: Wait--

241
00:22:08,882 --> 00:22:16,399
ORION: For the record, I'm really shitty at math,
so.

242
00:22:16,399 --> 00:22:24,951
MARISHA: What I was actually going to say was, I
am actually really impressed at the Critters as a

243
00:22:24,951 --> 00:22:32,459
whole and the Critter Nation. We had an awesome
story that we heard from our friend Dani who's a

244
00:22:32,459 --> 00:22:33,491
Critter.

245
00:22:33,491 --> 00:22:35,192
ASHLEY: Oh man, hi!

246
00:22:35,192 --> 00:22:43,126
MARISHA: I know, right? Hi! Yeah, she came out
here and then was talking to another Critter, and

247
00:22:43,126 --> 00:22:47,408
he was like, "You're in Southern California? Well,
I know people at Disneyland, so I can get you

248
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:51,682
"passes to Disneyland." And it was just because
they like Critical Role.

249
00:22:51,682 --> 00:22:54,981
LAURA: Be a Critter, go to Disneyland, that's the
moral of the story.

250
00:22:54,981 --> 00:22:58,712
MARISHA: So you guys are awesome because you guys
are taking care of each other, and I'm really

251
00:22:58,712 --> 00:23:02,740
loving the communities that I'm seeing are being
built and the friendships that are being built

252
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,431
around this.

253
00:23:04,431 --> 00:23:09,312
MATT: And the other campaigns that are coming out
of this. All you guys who have already been

254
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:13,122
playing or starting your own games and tweeting at
us your adventures and your stories and your

255
00:23:13,122 --> 00:23:16,076
characters, it's so awesome to see that
continue to grow.

256
00:23:16,076 --> 00:23:19,675
TALIESIN: It's like the internet, but nice! It's
so crazy.

257
00:23:19,675 --> 00:23:33,322
ORION: Yeah, it's super weird! I've been YouTubing
comedy stuff for a bit. They're mean. And our

258
00:23:33,322 --> 00:23:39,726
people are not mean and they're really intelligent
and compassionate. It's fucki-- really great.

259
00:23:39,726 --> 00:23:44,118
LAURA: What is happening?

260
00:23:44,118 --> 00:23:45,482
MATT: I don't know.

261
00:23:45,482 --> 00:23:49,512
LIAM: We're all kind of playing ourselves, people.
Let's be real.

262
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:53,362
MATT: Yeah, Tiberius's wisdom, maybe not that far
off.

263
00:23:53,362 --> 00:23:56,022
(laughter)

264
00:23:56,022 --> 00:23:57,569
TRAVIS: My intelligence is still six.

265
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:59,148
LAURA: Well, yeah.

266
00:23:59,148 --> 00:24:05,636
MARISHA: Questions? Q&A?

267
00:24:05,636 --> 00:24:08,842
MATT: Let's go ahead and move on to the Q&A
section of this. We have a mic available, I

268
00:24:08,842 --> 00:24:11,081
believe it's somewhere?

269
00:24:11,081 --> 00:24:13,035
MARISHA: Yeah, is there a mic floating around?

270
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:14,683
ASHLEY: (singing) I believe there's a mic.

271
00:24:14,683 --> 00:24:17,449
LIAM: I got it, I got it.

272
00:24:17,449 --> 00:24:19,204
MARISHA: Liam's got it.

273
00:24:19,204 --> 00:24:22,304
LIAM: Put your hands up if you've got questions.

274
00:24:22,304 --> 00:24:24,403
ORION: Vax is stealthing into the crowd.

275
00:24:24,403 --> 00:24:26,243
LAURA: You have to sneak through, though, they
won't be able to--

276
00:24:26,243 --> 00:24:30,824
MATT: Microphone-microphone-microphone.

277
00:24:30,824 --> 00:24:35,062
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I have a question for Orion. When
you wanted that thing from Scanlan, how long did

278
00:24:35,102 --> 00:24:38,042
it take you to think that up, to do that on that
board?

279
00:24:38,042 --> 00:24:45,356
ORION: I wanted that thing since he got it, and
really--

280
00:24:45,356 --> 00:24:46,933
LAURA: And he wouldn't give it to you.

281
00:24:46,933 --> 00:24:55,865
ORION: No. And I was going to approach it several
ways, and I talked to Matthew a lot outside the

282
00:24:55,865 --> 00:25:03,007
game. I never metagame, but I get really excited.
I've been playing RPGs since I was ten, and so

283
00:25:03,007 --> 00:25:12,737
half the time I think of strategy as opposed to
the player. I get really into that. Matthew's

284
00:25:12,737 --> 00:25:23,204
really good at, "Think of who you're dealing with,
and then act accordingly." With Sam, he's an

285
00:25:23,204 --> 00:25:28,646
interesting fellow to begin with. I was going to
pummel him to death. Really to get it back, at first.

286
00:25:28,646 --> 00:25:35,057
MARISHA: To which I was like, "Remember, your
party would not take kindly to that. I don't think

287
00:25:35,057 --> 00:25:37,725
"Keyleth would be able to take your back on that
one."

288
00:25:37,725 --> 00:25:43,997
ORION: No, she wouldn't like that. So I didn't.
That's the simple Silence, Telekinesis and then

289
00:25:43,997 --> 00:25:50,834
Fireball him to death. The thing is, I'm a UCB guy
(Upright Citizens Brigade), he's also a funny guy.

290
00:25:50,834 --> 00:26:00,980
There you go, UCB! He's funny, I'm funny, I'll
use funny. Then it was empty chalkboard. I was like,

291
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:08,951
"Math? That'll be funny. I'll fucking come up with
something." I figured more bees with honey. Or

292
00:26:08,951 --> 00:26:13,847
flies, I have no idea how that saying goes. You
know what I was trying to say, right?

293
00:26:13,847 --> 00:26:15,517
LIAM: It's the honey.

294
00:26:15,517 --> 00:26:20,828
ORION: Use the honey instead. I thought of that
for a month, of how to get that back.

295
00:26:20,828 --> 00:26:24,287
LAURA: It was worth it.

296
00:26:24,287 --> 00:26:27,613
LIAM: You mean you thought of that right there. In
the moment. It suddenly burst into your mind, and

297
00:26:27,613 --> 00:26:29,197
you did it right there.

298
00:26:29,197 --> 00:26:30,399
ORION: For the math thing, yes.

299
00:26:30,399 --> 00:26:33,311
ASHLEY: That math moment, it was one of my
favorites.

300
00:26:33,311 --> 00:26:38,192
TRAVIS: We love Scanlan, by the way. Every time he
comes up with a song, I ask him afterwards. I'm

301
00:26:38,192 --> 00:26:42,743
like, "Did you have two songs on retainer that you
were going to sing during the show?"

302
00:26:42,743 --> 00:26:46,377
LIAM: You guys have a baseball field behind you.
You look amazing.

303
00:26:46,377 --> 00:26:48,970
MARISHA: Shut up. Oh my god!

304
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:57,422
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Everyone looks very pretty. You
touched on this a bit whenever you were talking

305
00:26:57,422 --> 00:27:02,083
about how you started playing. How did you all
come up with your names individually?

306
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:04,598
LIAM: That's a good question.

307
00:27:04,598 --> 00:27:12,122
MATT: Mine's my professional name. I use it for
most things. It's easy for me to hear when people

308
00:27:12,122 --> 00:27:13,954
say it because it's my name.

309
00:27:13,954 --> 00:27:25,853
ASHLEY: Oh man. I had been trying to put together
this webseries ages ago that was basically a

310
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:36,134
post-zombie apocalypse type of thing. Then cut to
a little while later, I work on a game called Last

311
00:27:36,134 --> 00:27:41,466
Of Us, which was basically the same thing. But my
character's name in the webseries--

312
00:27:41,466 --> 00:27:43,913
MATT: By the way, how amazing was she in that?

313
00:27:43,913 --> 00:27:50,977
ASHLEY: Thank you. So, the webseries that my
character's name was Pike in it. I just like that

314
00:27:50,977 --> 00:27:57,454
name, and I honestly don't know where Trickfoot
came from. I can't remember it.

315
00:27:57,454 --> 00:27:59,023
MATT: Your imagination.

316
00:27:59,023 --> 00:28:03,756
ASHLEY: I was like, "True, tritch, trutch, Pike
Tr-- Oh, Trickfoot!" I don't know. There was

317
00:28:03,756 --> 00:28:05,824
nothing interesting about it.

318
00:28:05,824 --> 00:28:17,910
LAURA: I, like I said, like to play RPGs a lot,
and Vex was always a name that I would go to for

319
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:24,452
my characters I would create in those games. Then
I always think that elves need to have apostrophes

320
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:38,315
in their names. Because in every RPG like Dragon
Age, every game that I play, I recreate characters

321
00:28:38,315 --> 00:28:44,165
like ten times before I stick with one, so there's
a list to level four of characters--

322
00:28:44,165 --> 00:28:45,693
TRAVIS: True story.

323
00:28:45,693 --> 00:28:50,039
LAURA: Yeah, Vex is always in that list. There's
other names as well that I might get to. Someday

324
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:51,517
in this game. Hopefully not.

325
00:28:51,517 --> 00:28:53,509
ORION: Wait, you did that for Skyrim too, didn't
you?

326
00:28:53,509 --> 00:28:59,755
LAURA: Yes. Of course. I'm not Vex in Skyrim
because I feel like Vex is sacred now. I don't

327
00:28:59,755 --> 00:29:08,036
want to use Vex on-- Is that weird? Then, when me
and Liam-- Okay. So here's the thing. I'm getting

328
00:29:08,036 --> 00:29:15,591
off-subject. When I got invited to the game, Liam
had already taken rogue, and I wanted to be a

329
00:29:15,591 --> 00:29:19,966
rogue. He had already taken half-elf and I wanted
to be a half-elf. And I was like, "What the heck,

330
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:28,067
"man, you're so stealthy." Then I remembered that
we actually are twins, and I was like, "Maybe we

331
00:29:28,067 --> 00:29:29,958
"should be twins in the game as well."

332
00:29:29,958 --> 00:29:36,059
LIAM: You said your name was Vex. So I said, "Oh,
I'll be Vax then."

333
00:29:36,059 --> 00:29:37,356
LAURA: Perfect.

334
00:29:37,356 --> 00:29:41,888
LIAM: That's not what you said. You said, "But my
name's short for Vex'halia, so you got to come

335
00:29:41,888 --> 00:29:45,847
"up--" And I went, "I'll be Vax'ildan." Without a
beat, you went, "Oh, that's pretty good."

336
00:29:45,847 --> 00:29:49,766
LAURA: That's really good. What's funny is, for
the first year you kept looking at me like,

337
00:29:49,766 --> 00:29:52,682
"What's my name? How do I spell my name?"

338
00:29:52,682 --> 00:29:54,607
TRAVIS: We still don't get it right.

339
00:29:54,607 --> 00:29:57,680
LAURA: Is there an H in it? I don't know.

340
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:03,987
MARISHA: I actually still use Vaxy-stabby to
remember that. Cause we said vaxstab, like

341
00:30:03,987 --> 00:30:07,556
backstab. So he does vaxstab as rogue.

342
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:09,188
LIAM: There you go. Now you all have that.

343
00:30:09,188 --> 00:30:10,958
MARISHA: Vaxstab.

344
00:30:10,958 --> 00:30:12,399
LAURA: That's an easy way to remember.

345
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:24,223
MARISHA: Vex-dex? Yeah, that works. I'll buy that
for a dollar. Workshop it. I also really like

346
00:30:24,277 --> 00:30:33,799
elven names, but I'm like, "I feel that my name
should have meaning." I don't know why. I'll tend

347
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:35,603
to pick a character.

348
00:30:35,603 --> 00:30:43,560
For Keyleth I was like, "She's an Air Druid, so
I'll name her something airy. So I'll type in

349
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:51,275
"'air.'" I'll go to an elven dictionary and I'll
type in, "air." It'll pop out all these elven

350
00:30:51,275 --> 00:31:00,035
words for air. Or if my character was angsty, I'll
put in "angsty," and it'll pull out all these

351
00:31:00,035 --> 00:31:05,264
elven words for angsty. And I picked something
based on that. So I think Keyleth was actually

352
00:31:05,264 --> 00:31:13,263
originally spelled with a Q. It was a Que-- It
meant like a zephyr. It meant like a wind, so I

353
00:31:13,263 --> 00:31:16,225
switched it and renamed it and got Keyleth.

354
00:31:16,225 --> 00:31:19,054
LAURA: So your name actually means fart, and you
just don't know it?

355
00:31:19,054 --> 00:31:20,855
MATT: Exactly. Yeah. In Sylvan.

356
00:31:20,855 --> 00:31:22,953
MARISHA: No, it means silent but deadly.

357
00:31:22,953 --> 00:31:29,175
TRAVIS: What's the explanation behind yours?

358
00:31:29,175 --> 00:31:30,354
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

359
00:31:30,354 --> 00:31:31,927
ORION: Yeah, what's your name again?

360
00:31:31,927 --> 00:31:36,525
TALIESIN: Percival Fredrickstein von Musel
Klossowski de Rolo III.

361
00:31:36,525 --> 00:31:38,964
ORION: They call him Percy, though.

362
00:31:38,964 --> 00:31:47,825
TALIESIN: They call me Percy. I decided, after I
had an image of the character I wanted to play, I

363
00:31:47,825 --> 00:31:51,905
wanted him to have a ridiculous name because I
love ridiculous names. It's actually a mixture of

364
00:31:51,905 --> 00:31:56,643
three things, one of which is a character. I was a
child actor, also. One of them is the name of a

365
00:31:56,643 --> 00:32:04,205
character I played as a child actor. The other
section of it is the name of an anime character

366
00:32:04,205 --> 00:32:10,741
from Legend Of The Galactic Heroes. And the third
chunk of it is actually a friend of mine, who I

367
00:32:10,741 --> 00:32:15,954
will not name, but who has the greatest name on
earth. Yes, I'll leave it a mystery because he

368
00:32:15,954 --> 00:32:19,258
doesn't know that I stole his name for my little
D&D game.

369
00:32:19,258 --> 00:32:22,529
MARISHA: And now we're trademarking it.

370
00:32:22,529 --> 00:32:29,418
TALIESIN: And thankfully he's 80 years old and
lives in Italy, so he doesn't have to know about

371
00:32:29,418 --> 00:32:36,925
this. And I want to keep it that way. That's
basically where my character's name came from.

372
00:32:36,925 --> 00:32:38,936
This is a mix of all three of those things.

373
00:32:38,936 --> 00:32:43,182
LIAM: Somewhere in Tuscany, a little old Italian
man is standing up in front of his computer, and

374
00:32:43,182 --> 00:32:44,970
swearing in Italian.

375
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:48,929
TALIESIN: He types all in caps, too, so I'll never
know how angry he is.

376
00:32:48,929 --> 00:32:57,887
TRAVIS: Other than just coming up with it because
I hadn't made a name yet, because I'm an idiot, I

377
00:32:57,887 --> 00:33:03,938
loved Monkey Island, the game, and I remember that
was my introduction to Grog. I always figured that

378
00:33:03,938 --> 00:33:13,097
a barbarian needs a really simple name. So Grog
was the first stupid light that turned on in my

379
00:33:13,097 --> 00:33:16,608
brain. And that's what I am. And you came up with
my last name.

380
00:33:16,608 --> 00:33:17,845
MATT: Strongjaw, yeah.

381
00:33:17,845 --> 00:33:23,187
TRAVIS: That's right. Because I got possessed or
something at one point. It was bad. You.

382
00:33:23,187 --> 00:33:26,176
LIAM: I'm done. Tiberius.

383
00:33:26,176 --> 00:33:28,394
TALIESIN: Bring us home.

384
00:33:28,394 --> 00:33:39,915
ORION: Tiberius, I named for two reasons. The
first is, Tiberius Caesar is Caesar's father. I

385
00:33:39,915 --> 00:33:47,571
wanted the character, because it comes from a
political height to your family, to have that

386
00:33:47,571 --> 00:33:52,423
weight behind it. And Stormwind--

387
00:33:52,423 --> 00:33:54,618
TRAVIS: It's about farting.

388
00:33:54,618 --> 00:33:56,356
LIAM: That's another fart reference.

389
00:33:56,356 --> 00:34:04,476
ORION: This is, yes. I fart a lot. No. I was
actually--

390
00:34:04,476 --> 00:34:05,892
ASHLEY: Who doesn't?

391
00:34:05,892 --> 00:34:19,559
ORION: At the time, I was cracking the hell out of
Skyrim. Again. It came out, and you were passing,

392
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:27,019
and playing it again when we started the campaign,
and I think it's a place in Skyrim, or it's like

393
00:34:27,019 --> 00:34:29,748
the Stormwind, or something like that. I was like,
yeah, Stormwind, awesome.

394
00:34:29,748 --> 00:34:33,923
MARISHA: But I would like to point out, we didn't
even realize that you had done that until a few

395
00:34:33,923 --> 00:34:35,410
weeks ago.

396
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:36,479
ORION: Yeah.

397
00:34:36,479 --> 00:34:41,459
MARISHA: And we were like, ah! Because you were
playing Elder Scrolls Online. That's what it was.

398
00:34:41,459 --> 00:34:50,888
ORION: Thank you. Two and a half years and some
change years pass, yeah, I'm really creative. I've

399
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:58,564
totally-- It's really hard not to curse, so I'm
trying not to. I was like, wow, yeah, I came up

400
00:34:58,564 --> 00:35:06,538
with all that myself. And then I started playing
Elder Scrolls Online again, bad. Love that game. I

401
00:35:06,538 --> 00:35:12,570
was, Dragonknight, cool. Fans were, hey, just try
Dragonknight. And then I started playing and I'm

402
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:22,251
like, "Draconic Power, Draconia, oh shit, I ripped
off Skyrim the whole time! I'm not creative at

403
00:35:22,251 --> 00:35:25,266
"all!" Thanks for pointing that out, Marisha.

404
00:35:25,266 --> 00:35:27,590
LIAM: Any more questions?

405
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:33,269
MATT: Real fast, I did want to give a shout-out to
our wonderful gnome Scanlan, who is apparently

406
00:35:33,269 --> 00:35:35,371
watching from home and wants an ego stroke.

407
00:35:35,371 --> 00:35:37,400
ALL: Hi, Scanlan.

408
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,997
ASHLEY: We miss you.

409
00:35:40,997 --> 00:35:43,082
LIAM: All right. What?

410
00:35:43,082 --> 00:35:47,361
MATT: We have about 15 minutes left of the panel,
so we want to make this questions we have pretty

411
00:35:47,361 --> 00:35:48,708
quick answers to.

412
00:35:48,708 --> 00:35:50,117
LIAM: But we're Periscoping.

413
00:35:50,117 --> 00:35:54,301
(inaudible audience member)

414
00:35:54,301 --> 00:36:00,644
LIAM: What each character's most heroic moment
was. On the show, any time, including the whole game?

415
00:36:00,644 --> 00:36:11,780
MATT: Let's do whole game. I know Tiberius'. Want
me to tell the story?

416
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,721
LAURA: I feel like Matt would know our most--

417
00:36:13,721 --> 00:36:16,526
MATT: I know a lot of them, yeah. There was one
sequence. I'll make it quick. They were fighting

418
00:36:16,526 --> 00:36:21,244
their first umber hulk they ever encountered in
this nest that was in this cavern up at the top of

419
00:36:21,244 --> 00:36:26,861
a giant underground cave. And there was an about
170-foot drop into a lake that had an island in

420
00:36:26,861 --> 00:36:32,694
the center. And they were fighting it, Grog was
trying to grab it and throw it through the hole

421
00:36:32,694 --> 00:36:38,208
that dropped into this giant cavern. However, it
bull rushed him and knocked him off instead. Grog

422
00:36:38,208 --> 00:36:44,949
fell, took enough damage to put him unconscious
from full life, and the umber hulk then was pushed

423
00:36:44,949 --> 00:36:49,186
out after him via Tiberius, and they all realized,
oh, we're all up here with a hole with no

424
00:36:49,186 --> 00:36:53,992
creature. Grog's unconscious down there with an
umber hulk. He is going to die. And so Tiberius

425
00:36:53,992 --> 00:36:58,496
decides he's going to jump out after him. And he
leaps through the hole, swan dive, I'm talking

426
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:04,137
Gandalf versus the Balrog style. You know, slow
plummet in darkness. I'm telling him, "You

427
00:37:04,137 --> 00:37:09,029
"realize, casting Feather Fall is going to take a
really hard concentration check, and if you fail,

428
00:37:09,029 --> 00:37:20,623
"you're probably going to die." And he said, "Yes.
Do it." He needed a 14 on a d20, and he rolled

429
00:37:20,623 --> 00:37:27,053
exactly a 14, cast Feather Fall, landed, and
managed to stop the umber hulk in time to let the

430
00:37:27,053 --> 00:37:30,368
rest of the party come down via rope. It was one
of my favorite moments for his character.

431
00:37:30,368 --> 00:37:36,069
(cheering)

432
00:37:36,069 --> 00:37:37,764
LAURA: It was pretty epic.

433
00:37:37,764 --> 00:37:39,143
ORION: I got your back.

434
00:37:39,143 --> 00:37:41,572
MATT: Anyone else?

435
00:37:41,572 --> 00:37:46,473
LAURA: We thought we were going to lose two party
members at the same time. We were, like, "No! Ugh!"

436
00:37:46,473 --> 00:37:48,750
MATT: Anyone else?

437
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:54,903
LAURA: Well, I got the kill on the creature that
killed Pike.

438
00:37:54,903 --> 00:37:56,830
ASHLEY: You did.

439
00:37:56,830 --> 00:38:02,873
LAURA: I don't get a final kill on a lot of
things, and it was like ugh, and so Pike is dead

440
00:38:02,873 --> 00:38:11,079
on the ground, and I got the last shot, so I'm
moving forward shooting arrows. It was sad. Tears

441
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:13,494
falling down, screaming, "Pike!"

442
00:38:13,494 --> 00:38:18,084
MARISHA: I was actually going to say, I think one
of my most heroic moments was in the same game

443
00:38:18,084 --> 00:38:25,451
when Pike died, and Keyleth turned into an eagle,
and I scooped you up, and got you to the temple

444
00:38:25,451 --> 00:38:30,939
first. Was it at the same time that the tower was
collapsing?

445
00:38:30,939 --> 00:38:32,530
MATT: No, that was beforehand.

446
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:33,985
MARISHA: Oh, that was beforehand. Okay.

447
00:38:33,985 --> 00:38:38,775
MATT: A battle with a treachery demon, by the way,
a glabrezu, for those who are in the know. I get

448
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:41,835
to say that in a panel.

449
00:38:41,835 --> 00:38:46,155
ORION: Translation: He's a giant butthole.

450
00:38:46,155 --> 00:38:51,787
TALIESIN: I was quite proud of the magic carpet
save. Our very first run-in with the magic carpet.

451
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:57,978
It's a very complicated story, but we found the
magic carpet out of luck while falling out of a

452
00:38:57,978 --> 00:39:02,574
building and everything. Kind of worked out okay.
No one died.

453
00:39:02,574 --> 00:39:07,132
MARISHA: The magic carpet was awesome, because we
were trying to use it as a parachute.

454
00:39:07,132 --> 00:39:09,316
LAURA: That's right, because we were falling--

455
00:39:09,316 --> 00:39:13,206
MARISHA: And it was essentially a gamble move
anyway. We were going to be like, oh, let's be--

456
00:39:13,206 --> 00:39:17,204
LAURA: This carpet's never going to work, it's too
heavy.

457
00:39:17,204 --> 00:39:20,443
MARISHA: Exactly. We are going to be like those
toy GI Joes that you throw over your balcony, and

458
00:39:20,443 --> 00:39:26,585
it doesn't work. That's what we thought. Then
we're trying to parachute with a rug, and that's

459
00:39:26,585 --> 00:39:32,043
when Matt's like, "And you float down slowly
because you learn the carpet is magic."

460
00:39:32,043 --> 00:39:40,095
ASHLEY: Right before that, he goes, "Make a use
magic device roll," and we were all, "What?!" And

461
00:39:40,095 --> 00:39:42,682
you screamed, "It's a flying carpet!"

462
00:39:42,682 --> 00:39:50,000
LIAM: Many of you have seen this moment, because
Ashley made a video. It's online. You get a lot of

463
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,066
our reactions to that, real time.

464
00:39:52,066 --> 00:39:57,838
ORION: That whole thing was another one of my
favorite Tiberius moments because he didn't deal

465
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:01,733
with any of it. Tiberius jumped out the window
while that shit was going down and Feather Fall to

466
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:04,446
safety while these guys had to deal with that
whole fucking thing.

467
00:40:04,446 --> 00:40:06,786
TRAVIS: I did that, too. I jumped out of the
window with no Feather Fall.

468
00:40:06,786 --> 00:40:14,195
ORION: They go through this whole ordeal and they
come out of this tower that's crumbling, barely

469
00:40:14,195 --> 00:40:16,756
with their lives and I'm like, "Oh, hello
everyone."

470
00:40:16,756 --> 00:40:20,844
TRAVIS: You go jump out of the window and I'm
like, "Great idea!" Jump out of the window. You

471
00:40:20,844 --> 00:40:27,436
cast Feather Fall and I'm like, "Shit." Live and
learn!

472
00:40:27,436 --> 00:40:30,642
MARISHA: (singing) I wish you would step back from
that ledge, my friend.

473
00:40:30,642 --> 00:40:36,078
TRAVIS: My most heroic thing was when you crushed my
cask of ale and I avenged it by headbutting the

474
00:40:36,078 --> 00:40:40,395
giant in the face. True love, people, true love.

475
00:40:40,395 --> 00:40:46,309
LIAM: I don't know about heroic, but I think the
most intense moment I've had in our entire game

476
00:40:46,309 --> 00:40:52,897
was sneaking in with Scanlan into the mind
flayers' little camp. You were just describing all

477
00:40:52,897 --> 00:40:57,957
the things that were in the room and we were
walking quietly through the room looking at it. My

478
00:40:57,957 --> 00:41:00,979
heart was going like a hamster. It was intense!

479
00:41:00,979 --> 00:41:06,314
ORION: And then Sam throws shit on the dude's
face.

480
00:41:06,314 --> 00:41:14,839
MARISHA: At any moment you hear us on the screen
being like, "Oh god! I'm hyperventilating! The

481
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:21,728
"adrenaline! My heart's racing! I'm shaking!"
That's all 100% real. We'll actually be like, "Oh,

482
00:41:21,728 --> 00:41:27,105
"we've got to roll. Oh, I dropped it!" It's awful.
It's all real. It's good.

483
00:41:27,105 --> 00:41:29,071
LIAM: Any other questions?

484
00:41:29,071 --> 00:41:31,179
MARISHA: Ten minutes!

485
00:41:31,179 --> 00:41:34,038
MATT: You have time for a few more, so start
getting these pretty rapid.

486
00:41:34,038 --> 00:41:36,364
LIAM: Sword. Maybe take your filter out of the
way.

487
00:41:36,364 --> 00:41:41,439
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thanks, man. Hey guys, how's it
going?

488
00:41:41,439 --> 00:41:45,487
MATT: Good! Good question. Next? No, go ahead.

489
00:41:45,487 --> 00:41:51,840
AUDIENCE MEMBER: My question isn't about D&D, it's
actually: How are you guys enjoying your time here

490
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:58,188
in San Diego or, more specifically, at Comic-Con?
What's the best, or most shocking cosplay you've

491
00:41:58,188 --> 00:42:03,588
seen, or a cosplay where you guys were like, "Oh,
that's awesome!" Have you guys even seen any

492
00:42:03,588 --> 00:42:05,837
cosplay, or have you been too busy?

493
00:42:05,837 --> 00:42:07,831
TRAVIS: We've seen no cosplay!

494
00:42:07,831 --> 00:42:09,798
MARISHA: We've been here the whole time.

495
00:42:09,798 --> 00:42:12,841
MATT: I'm having a good time.

496
00:42:12,841 --> 00:42:14,490
MARISHA: Yeah, we're having a great time!

497
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,417
TRAVIS: This sucks!

498
00:42:16,417 --> 00:42:20,867
MARISHA: We have a baseball field behind us! So
that's cool.

499
00:42:20,867 --> 00:42:28,399
MATT: Best cosplay I've seen here. It was a couple
years ago, I saw a really amazing Mass Effect

500
00:42:28,399 --> 00:42:36,799
group that had an Urdnot Wrex that had a
functional animatronic face. It was incredible.

501
00:42:36,799 --> 00:42:45,931
TALIESIN: I saw a guy dressed as Hodor with a box
of Raisin Bran on his back. It was awesome!

502
00:42:45,931 --> 00:42:48,579
ORION: We've got another question.

503
00:42:48,579 --> 00:42:56,375
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Sorry, Orion. Hi. This is a DM
question for Matt because--

504
00:42:56,375 --> 00:42:57,781
MATT: Oh hi!

505
00:42:57,781 --> 00:43:02,500
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi! I had problems with this in
previous campaigns as a player and now as a DM

506
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:09,819
with six new players. How do you keep battle going
when players take time to roll? How can you

507
00:43:09,819 --> 00:43:14,382
encourage people to keep a flow going so at the
end of the game you're like, "That was epic!"

508
00:43:14,382 --> 00:43:16,540
instead of "That was math."

509
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:21,992
MATT: Right. The system helps. Our transition from
Pathfinder to Fifth Edition I did partially

510
00:43:21,992 --> 00:43:25,738
because of that. Pathfinder's a great system and I
love it, but the more players you have, the more

511
00:43:25,738 --> 00:43:29,694
you can get bogged down with floating modifiers.
"Wait, your Bless spells gives me plus one to

512
00:43:29,694 --> 00:43:33,761
"hit and damage, and that gives me plus two to
damage, but I have a racial bonus against the

513
00:43:33,761 --> 00:43:40,222
"kobolds, plus six to hit, four to damage, three to
damage." It gets to that point. Being able to

514
00:43:40,222 --> 00:43:45,038
simplify the modifiers. You can homerule certain
things where you have a simple way of keeping

515
00:43:45,038 --> 00:43:51,804
track of those. As a DM, keeping combat going is
just keeping your energy up. You're the guide for

516
00:43:51,804 --> 00:43:57,677
everyone else, and if you start getting slow or laggy,
everyone else will follow suit. Music also helps.

517
00:43:57,677 --> 00:44:02,223
I find battle music, really good sets. We can't
use any licensed stuff on the stream any more. I

518
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:11,431
had to gut my previous music selections. Good
classic Conan music works well. Lot of great

519
00:44:11,431 --> 00:44:13,224
fantasy films and good soundtracks work.

520
00:44:13,224 --> 00:44:16,211
MARISHA and LAURA: (horn sounds)

521
00:44:16,211 --> 00:44:23,487
MATT: They know them all too well. Good music,
keeping your energy up, and making sure that when

522
00:44:23,487 --> 00:44:28,312
it comes to players' turns, they know what they're
going to do. If they're not ready, you skip their

523
00:44:28,312 --> 00:44:30,138
turn. You're hesitating.

524
00:44:30,138 --> 00:44:34,562
LAURA: That's happened to us a few times. Before
we started streaming, he would skip our turns.

525
00:44:34,562 --> 00:44:38,364
MARISHA: You would be like, "What are you going to
do?" And if we say "Uh," more than three times,

526
00:44:38,364 --> 00:44:41,186
then he's like, "Nah." We'd go, "Uh, uh, uh,"
"Moving on."

527
00:44:41,186 --> 00:44:47,062
MATT: Skip it or put them at the bottom of the
initiative order. Give them an incentive to be

528
00:44:47,062 --> 00:44:51,374
present in the moment and already to have their
ideas ready to go. Things change in battle

529
00:44:51,374 --> 00:44:54,475
sometimes. You'll get to your turn and
everything's changed in the battle dynamic. That's

530
00:44:54,475 --> 00:45:00,771
also how battle works. You have to be like, "Uh!
I'm going to do this!" And you're like,

531
00:45:00,771 --> 00:45:08,429
"All right!" Keeping that energy up. As the DM,
you're the holder of the flow of the story. It's a

532
00:45:08,429 --> 00:45:13,712
lot of pressure on you, but keep up that energy.
Some good music. Make sure people are also putting

533
00:45:13,712 --> 00:45:18,938
energy into it because you put countless hours
into that stuff! The least they can do is respect

534
00:45:18,938 --> 00:45:20,966
that by being present and trying to keep up with
you.

535
00:45:20,966 --> 00:45:23,066
TALIESIN: Really quick. Tell them about the
hourglass.

536
00:45:23,066 --> 00:45:29,056
MATT: Also, hourglass helps! I got a nice five
minute and ten minute hourglass. Especially if

537
00:45:29,056 --> 00:45:34,141
you're in a skill challenge or an event that has
more tension behind it, just putting an hourglass

538
00:45:34,141 --> 00:45:38,785
on the table, turning it over and being like, "You
have this much time." "Until what?!" "You don't

539
00:45:38,785 --> 00:45:44,827
"know. But what are you going to do?" You'll be
surprised how quickly in the moment every player is.

540
00:45:44,827 --> 00:45:49,453
LAURA: It's terrifying. That hourglass you put
down when the lava was coming down and we had to

541
00:45:49,453 --> 00:45:52,943
get out of the cavern. It was horrifying!

542
00:45:52,943 --> 00:45:57,346
ORION: It adds a whole other layer of-- Another
question.

543
00:45:57,346 --> 00:46:03,206
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi, guys. What I wanted to ask--

544
00:46:03,206 --> 00:46:05,220
LIAM: Get it right up there.

545
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:10,460
AUDIENCE MEMBER: What I wanted to ask is
especially for Grog and Pike since they personally

546
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:15,247
experienced this lovely thing. Was there ever a
time when you die in Matt's game where you're

547
00:46:15,247 --> 00:46:21,089
afraid that this is going to be the death of the
character and they're not going to get revived

548
00:46:21,089 --> 00:46:22,316
this time?

549
00:46:22,316 --> 00:46:23,316
ORION: Yes!

550
00:46:23,316 --> 00:46:25,532
LIAM: That's every game!

551
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:33,517
TRAVIS: When Pike died, she was crying, she was
crying, she was crying, you were crying. I was

552
00:46:33,517 --> 00:46:41,907
asleep. No! Matt, you could tell he did not want
to say the things he was saying, and it was only

553
00:46:41,907 --> 00:46:47,867
because we rolled extremely well when it counted
that we got that thing that brought you back to

554
00:46:47,867 --> 00:46:55,339
life. Every time we go unconscious and then the
death sets in. Against the beholder thing, I was

555
00:46:55,339 --> 00:46:59,999
just hoping we got around to Pike or Keyleth, so
that Greater Restoration could come around, I

556
00:46:59,999 --> 00:47:03,250
wouldn't permanently be dead. There's a chance
that one of these days.

557
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:13,367
LAURA: When you were unconscious in the lava,
what? I thought he was done. If Trinket dies, I-- Yes!

558
00:47:13,367 --> 00:47:21,509
ORION: In all seriousness, the K'Varn fight is a
really good example. Myself, Tiberius, was

559
00:47:21,509 --> 00:47:30,569
terrified of fighting a beholder because I knew,
particularly as the only real caster of the group,

560
00:47:30,569 --> 00:47:36,681
as soon as I get in the eyesight of that thing,
I'm useless. The reason that I didn't go in there

561
00:47:36,776 --> 00:47:42,732
at all is because if I did, I would be no use to
anybody. I don't know the range. I'm not going to

562
00:47:42,732 --> 00:47:47,288
cheat. You don't come back from disintegration!

563
00:47:47,288 --> 00:47:49,292
MATT: Nope!

564
00:47:49,292 --> 00:47:53,032
ORION: You don't come back from death rays!
They're called death rays for a reason! And then

565
00:47:53,032 --> 00:47:55,502
he throws it at us and I'm scared for a while.

566
00:47:55,502 --> 00:48:01,798
ASHLEY: That was the most nervous I'd ever been
in any game we've played. I think that's why it

567
00:48:01,798 --> 00:48:08,807
was such a silent game. I was just like-- I just
never wanted it to be my turn because I was like,

568
00:48:08,807 --> 00:48:11,233
"Uh! Well!"

569
00:48:11,233 --> 00:48:12,903
TRAVIS: We didn't even talk in voices.

570
00:48:12,903 --> 00:48:14,403
ASHLEY: I know. There were no voices.

571
00:48:14,403 --> 00:48:17,940
MATT: You're twice the reason we still have Grog.
He technically would have died twice that battle

572
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:19,227
over.

573
00:48:19,227 --> 00:48:20,359
LAURA: That is true.

574
00:48:20,359 --> 00:48:23,014
ASHLEY: That's true. Oh, Grog!

575
00:48:23,014 --> 00:48:26,499
LAURA: I went back and watched the stream of that
to see if you could see our hands shaking as much

576
00:48:26,499 --> 00:48:29,997
as they were because all of us were terrified
during that fight.

577
00:48:29,997 --> 00:48:34,764
MATT: Yeah. That was a crazy boss battle. What
were you going to say, Liam?

578
00:48:34,764 --> 00:48:38,925
LAURA: And then the second one was even harder
than that! What the heck, Matt?!

579
00:48:38,925 --> 00:48:45,869
MATT: That was less of a boss battle and more of a
scenario-based challenge. You walked into the

580
00:48:45,869 --> 00:48:53,243
center of an illithid colony and freed them of
their oppressor!

581
00:48:53,243 --> 00:48:56,723
MARISHA: Exactly! We're their saviors!

582
00:48:56,723 --> 00:48:58,292
TALIESIN: We had a buddy!

583
00:48:58,292 --> 00:49:01,231
ORION: More like a butthole.

584
00:49:01,231 --> 00:49:06,023
MATT: Lessons were learned, people.

585
00:49:06,023 --> 00:49:12,805
MARISHA: By the way, this is essentially a glimpse
into our time after the show cuts. It's us yelling

586
00:49:12,805 --> 00:49:22,230
and being like, "Why did you do that?! You could
have died! Don't you scare me like that again!"

587
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:29,094
Feel like a protective mom being like, slamming
on the brakes.

588
00:49:29,094 --> 00:49:30,388
ORION: One more question?

589
00:49:30,388 --> 00:49:32,784
MATT: We have time for one more really fast,
rapid-paced question. We'll answer and cruise

590
00:49:32,784 --> 00:49:35,806
through it. We have a minute left and then we have
to run.

591
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:40,475
LIAM: As Orion is running out, please take a
moment to appreciate the fact that we've been

592
00:49:40,475 --> 00:49:44,031
talking about Dungeons & Dragons for an hour in
front of a baseball stadium.

593
00:49:44,031 --> 00:49:47,691
(cheering)

594
00:49:47,691 --> 00:49:50,205
LIAM and MARISHA: Our time is now!

595
00:49:50,205 --> 00:49:56,275
AUDIENCE MEMBER: All right guys, real quick. Same
time next year?

596
00:49:56,275 --> 00:50:00,054
MATT: Same time next year? We're down!

597
00:50:00,054 --> 00:50:02,006
LAURA: Yeah!

598
00:50:02,006 --> 00:50:03,855
ASHLEY: It's a date!

599
00:50:03,855 --> 00:50:05,472
MARISHA: We brought sleeping bags.

600
00:50:05,472 --> 00:50:07,646
MATT: We'd be happy to.

601
00:50:07,646 --> 00:50:08,958
MARISHA: Yeah, we'll be here.

602
00:50:08,958 --> 00:50:10,375
LAURA: You guys are awesome.

603
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:12,495
ASHLEY: All hail!

604
00:50:12,495 --> 00:50:13,995
MARISHA: Oh, Ify!

605
00:50:13,995 --> 00:50:21,296
IFY: Question for the DM. I heard rumors that
there might be a little space for a sellsword of

606
00:50:21,296 --> 00:50:29,964
some type. If you got the gold for it, I've got
Regina and Linda waiting by my sacks of gold.

607
00:50:29,964 --> 00:50:35,861
MATT: Classic dwarven request!

608
00:50:35,861 --> 00:50:40,380
MARISHA: Money talks and bullshit walks.

609
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:45,437
MATT: We shall see if the adventures of Vox
Machina mind their way towards Vox Moronica. Guys,

610
00:50:45,437 --> 00:50:48,815
that is the end of our panel. I want to thank you
all so much for coming!

611
00:50:48,815 --> 00:50:54,886
(cheering)
