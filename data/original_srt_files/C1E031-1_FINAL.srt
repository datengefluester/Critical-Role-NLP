00:00:00,151 --> 00:00:04,749
MATT: Hello and good evening, everyone, and
welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, a

2
00:00:04,826 --> 00:00:09,459
show where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors
play D&amp;D, Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Roll dice and kill

3
00:00:09,459 --> 00:00:13,309
monsters and sometimes maybe get killed
themselves. I don't know.

4
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:16,743
(yelling)

5
00:00:16,743 --> 00:00:21,767
MATT: Because it's fun to set the tone. It's fun.
But yeah, so anyway. Thank you guys for joining

6
00:00:21,767 --> 00:00:27,888
us, old and new, welcome to our chaos. We have a
few announcements to get through before we start

7
00:00:27,888 --> 00:00:33,277
tonight's game. First and foremost, for those who
haven't seen, we've been putting up Spotify

8
00:00:33,277 --> 00:00:39,987
playlists compiled by our different players here.
And this week we had Vex, Laura, put up her

9
00:00:39,987 --> 00:00:44,833
playlist. Which is awesome. If you want to say
something about your playlist and some cool stuff

10
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:46,565
they can look forward to?

11
00:00:46,565 --> 00:00:53,989
LAURA: Just that it's the coolest. No, it's
actually weirdly personal to put it together and

12
00:00:53,989 --> 00:01:02,249
put it up. It feels like you're baring your soul.
So I hope you guys enjoy my soul. And also, song

13
00:01:02,249 --> 00:01:04,877
three, which is like... everything.

14
00:01:04,877 --> 00:01:07,697
MARISHA: That one might have made me cry a little
bit.

15
00:01:07,697 --> 00:01:08,610
LAURA: Right?

16
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,686
MARISHA: Yeah, just a little.

17
00:01:09,686 --> 00:01:12,328
LAURA: I may or may not have been thinking of the
Critters while I was picking that song. Just so

18
00:01:12,328 --> 00:01:13,770
you guys know.

19
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,082
TALIESIN: I'm so excited. I haven't heard yours
yet.

20
00:01:16,082 --> 00:01:17,238
SAM: Are we on?

21
00:01:17,238 --> 00:01:18,691
MATT: We are on. Hi. Welcome, Sam.

22
00:01:18,691 --> 00:01:20,033
SAM: Hi, guys.

23
00:01:20,033 --> 00:01:22,014
LIAM: You're so early tonight.

24
00:01:22,014 --> 00:01:23,078
SAM: (breathless) Oh yeah, sorry.

25
00:01:23,078 --> 00:01:24,437
(laughter)

26
00:01:24,437 --> 00:01:29,262
MARISHA: We're the beginning of the
announcements. It's great. We were talking about

27
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:30,524
the playlists.

28
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:32,400
SAM: Oh, I've got to finish mine.

29
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,186
MARISHA: Yeah! You're almost done. I will say, for
those who have not gone and checked out any of the

30
00:01:38,186 --> 00:01:44,708
playlists, we have Vax and Percy up as well.
Definitely go do it, because all that little extra

31
00:01:44,708 --> 00:01:50,792
content that we put out is always kind of a litmus
test, to see if people are going to be interested

32
00:01:50,792 --> 00:01:56,869
in it. And if you guys go and actually visit the
webpage at Geek &amp; Sundry, then we get more

33
00:01:56,869 --> 00:01:59,335
content. So the more you go visit it--

34
00:01:59,335 --> 00:02:00,557
MATT: Make more stuff for you guys, yeah.

35
00:02:00,557 --> 00:02:06,217
MARISHA: Yeah, the more that we can show the
people upstairs that people do like our stuff and

36
00:02:06,217 --> 00:02:10,945
our content, the more you will get. So please go
check it out if you have not yet. It helps.

37
00:02:10,945 --> 00:02:13,640
TALIESIN: Here, actually, do this with me. Let's
make a double rainbow gif, for later.

38
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,426
(laughter)

39
00:02:16,426 --> 00:02:18,365
LAURA: That's beautiful.

40
00:02:18,365 --> 00:02:20,604
MATT: That's on you, CritRoleSource.

41
00:02:20,604 --> 00:02:21,814
TALIESIN: That's on you, internet.

42
00:02:21,814 --> 00:02:23,048
MARISHA: You're welcome.

43
00:02:23,048 --> 00:02:27,278
MATT: Cool. So that's awesome. Next announcement,
for those who haven't had a chance to see it. A

44
00:02:27,278 --> 00:02:33,320
little over a year ago I Kickstarted a web series
with a bunch of other really talented people. Sean

45
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,917
Becker, who is director of The Guild, directed it.
It's called Muzzled the Musical. Ashly Burch, a

46
00:02:37,917 --> 00:02:41,863
bunch of great talented people from The Lizzie
Bennet Diaries and a bunch of other web series,

47
00:02:41,863 --> 00:02:46,922
Juliet Landau is in it. It's a great fun web
series and it went live last week right before

48
00:02:46,922 --> 00:02:50,921
Halloween. So we have our three-episode arc up on
YouTube. If you like musicals and you like fun

49
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:56,834
silly dark, Doctor Horrible-style performances,
then you're going to like this. Check it out, see

50
00:02:56,834 --> 00:03:05,802
if you like it. Let's see. Oh yeah, tomorrow is
BlizzCon. BlizzCon, for all you crazy guys who are

51
00:03:05,802 --> 00:03:11,187
going or those who are watching on the digital
online pass. A bunch of us Critters will be

52
00:03:11,187 --> 00:03:16,609
wandering the halls, doing panels and all kinds of
fun stuff. Like, for me personally, I'll be there

53
00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:19,422
tomorrow at 4:30. I think, Liam, you are on that
as well?

54
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:20,429
LIAM: Yeah, same panel.

55
00:03:20,429 --> 00:03:24,309
MATT: Yeah, The World of Warcraft Live panel.
We'll be there doing that. And then doing a

56
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:27,056
signing afterward. What else you guys got going on
at BlizzCon?

57
00:03:27,056 --> 00:03:34,840
LIAM: I'm on three, so I think it's two on Friday
and one on Saturday. I tweeted out the times.

58
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,101
Don't remember them now, so just go check my feed
if you want. I'll see you there.

59
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:40,548
MATT: Awesome.

60
00:03:40,548 --> 00:03:45,050
ZAC: I'm going to have to do my job really quick and
jump in on that. And say that tomorrow at 4:30PM

61
00:03:45,185 --> 00:03:50,941
PST here, we will be doing a live trailer watch
and reveal with special guests. Laura and Travis

62
00:03:50,941 --> 00:03:56,488
are coming by. Alison Haislip and Ify Nwadiwe are
going to be our hosts for that. And then we are

63
00:03:56,488 --> 00:04:00,324
going to have interviews with Duncan Jones the
director and some of the cast and crew. It's going

64
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:02,972
to be really cool, so tune in tomorrow, 4:30, for
that.

65
00:04:02,972 --> 00:04:08,667
TALIESIN: And then if you're at BlizzCon, I think
we're going to be wandering around a little bit.

66
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:09,717
MARISHA: Yes, I'll be there.

67
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:10,874
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'll be there.

68
00:04:10,874 --> 00:04:13,018
MARISHA: We'll be there. Probably watching his
panels.

69
00:04:13,018 --> 00:04:22,953
MATT: Rock that out. Cool. Also, tonight is
Critmas. So for those who want to hang around.

70
00:04:23,056 --> 00:04:27,651
(voice cracking) We have quite a cavalcade of
presents.

71
00:04:27,806 --> 00:04:29,293
LAURA: There's a lot of presents, you guys.

72
00:04:29,293 --> 00:04:32,569
LIAM: Taliesin and I got here early and with Ryan
we opened everything and it's an

73
00:04:32,569 --> 00:04:34,875
embarrassment of riches.

74
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,857
LAURA: They had to open it so that we wouldn't be
opening the boxes.

75
00:04:37,956 --> 00:04:39,310
TALIESIN: We tried not to peek.

76
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:46,194
LIAM: Some of the stuff I didn't see, some of the
stuff Taliesin didn't see. So we're not completely

77
00:04:46,194 --> 00:04:47,468
spoiled, we're a little spoiled.

78
00:04:47,468 --> 00:04:49,646
LAURA: We got a little spoiled. I got a little
spoiled early, though.

79
00:04:49,646 --> 00:04:51,516
MATT: Because of that.

80
00:04:51,516 --> 00:04:55,130
LAURA: Somebody sent a new Trinket! Look at that,
you guys!

81
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,037
MATT: Giant bear.

82
00:04:57,037 --> 00:04:59,265
LAURA: Look at him. He's so cute.

83
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:03,501
LIAM: And please. I mean, we thought it was a
corpse, at first, when we got it. Then, when we

84
00:05:03,501 --> 00:05:09,789
opened it up we got really excited and I had this,
which I used to open it. We got really excited and

85
00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:13,120
took a bear out, and then it was a bear and we
forgot about all the wrappings and the paper. So

86
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,313
if you sent us the bear, please contact us now.

87
00:05:15,313 --> 00:05:16,782
SAM: Wait, we don't know who sent it?!

88
00:05:16,782 --> 00:05:23,991
LIAM: Just contact us now. You're watching.
Somebody is watching who knows that person, so

89
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,290
just let us know.

90
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,726
MATT: Find them, post it in the chat room.

91
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:28,350
TALIESIN: Somewhere they're saying, "That's my
bear".

92
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:31,997
LAURA: Please! I have just been hugging it
non-stop.

93
00:05:31,997 --> 00:05:35,618
MATT: It was pretty amazing when it was wrapped
up. It looked like a body. Like, straight up,

94
00:05:35,618 --> 00:05:37,930
season two Dexter. It was pretty fantastic.

95
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:41,510
MARISHA: Which leads us to our next point. Please
don't send us bodies.

96
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,659
MATT: Please don't. No bodies.

97
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:46,476
TALIESIN: Address it to me, if you do.

98
00:05:46,476 --> 00:05:48,510
MATT: (laughs) He'll know what to do.

99
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:53,208
LIAM: I think if it had been the only package, we
would have been able to focus better, but there

100
00:05:53,208 --> 00:06:00,499
were about a hundred packages, so it was difficult
for us to focus. We were opening stuff for an hour

101
00:06:00,499 --> 00:06:02,386
and a half, so thanks in advance.

102
00:06:02,386 --> 00:06:07,381
MATT: So thanks in advance for that. Also, you
will recognize a couple of new songs tonight. We

103
00:06:07,381 --> 00:06:13,774
had the wonderful pleasure of having Bethesda
approve us using Elder Scrolls music in our

104
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:20,235
on-channel playlists. So I have been able to go
back and re-incorporate all of my old Elder

105
00:06:20,235 --> 00:06:25,912
Scrolls music that I used when we originally
played off stream. So that's really cool. Thank

106
00:06:25,912 --> 00:06:27,689
you, Bethesda. Thank you guys very much.

107
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:29,742
TALIESIN: Now ten percent more realistic: Critical
Role.

108
00:06:29,742 --> 00:06:31,961
MATT: Exactly. Imagine that. Really stoked about
that.

109
00:06:31,961 --> 00:06:33,364
TALIESIN: More authentic. Homebrew.

110
00:06:33,364 --> 00:06:38,532
MATT: Just a reminder. The "How do you want to do
this?" shirts are up. I still have to get

111
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:46,743
one for myself. I think I should. And we have the
Critical Role necklace and awesome keychain, which

112
00:06:46,847 --> 00:06:48,466
I have not seen in person until tonight.

113
00:06:48,466 --> 00:06:50,038
LAURA: They're really cool.

114
00:06:50,038 --> 00:06:57,857
MATT: So we'll pass them around and we can each
give it our blessing. Each individual one is

115
00:06:57,857 --> 00:07:03,493
blessed by me. That's not true, but you will still
roll well while wearing one. So that's exciting,

116
00:07:03,594 --> 00:07:10,367
and let's see what else we got. Do you want to do
the quick Wyrmwood thing? Reminder from Wyrmwood?

117
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:16,872
LIAM: Yeah. We are friends with Wyrmwood Gaming,
and you can still use the code CritRole to get

118
00:07:16,872 --> 00:07:21,977
free shipping on an order for your wood. Its
beautiful wood. I have some black wood, but

119
00:07:21,977 --> 00:07:23,829
there's many different colors.

120
00:07:23,829 --> 00:07:25,239
LAURA: I got this wood.

121
00:07:25,239 --> 00:07:30,960
LIAM: They are really, really beautiful. So just
share the nerd connections, everybody.

122
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,318
MARISHA: Pretty sexy.

123
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:35,650
LAURA: These are the Kickstarter boxes, though.
These are what's being done now, or are those for

124
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:36,769
sale right now?

125
00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:42,475
LIAM: The Kickstarter boxes are not. The CritRole
code will not work for these, but they'll work for

126
00:07:42,475 --> 00:07:44,327
these bad mama-jamas right here.

127
00:07:44,327 --> 00:07:45,705
SAM: Which is really what you want.

128
00:07:45,705 --> 00:07:49,665
LAURA: And these, too. These are deck boxes.

129
00:07:49,665 --> 00:07:57,125
MATT: Yeah. Thank you, Wyrmwood, for being so
awesome and for putting that code together

130
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,511
for our community.

131
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:00,360
LIAM: I have one personal thing.

132
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,368
MATT: Yes, please.

133
00:08:01,368 --> 00:08:05,526
LIAM: I have a pilot on Amazon Prime called
Everstar, where I play a little robot.

134
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:06,732
SAM: Is that true?!

135
00:08:06,732 --> 00:08:08,421
LIAM: And he's really uptight. Yeah, that's a
pilot.

136
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,920
SAM: Oh, did the Amazon pilots launch today?

137
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:15,029
LIAM: They all launched, and I'm in a cute
adventure cartoon for young girls and boys. And

138
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:21,301
I'm up against bloody, gritty live-action dramas
and political satire and other cartoons, as well.

139
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:26,344
Roger Craig Smith is playing Mouse Cookies. But if
you like Everstar, which is this young

140
00:08:26,344 --> 00:08:30,319
action/adventure space-pirate story, give it a
watch. If you like it, vote it through. If it gets

141
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,884
voted through, I will continue to be a robot.

142
00:08:32,884 --> 00:08:38,004
SAM: I directed one, too, called Yoyotoki Happy
Ears. So that's on there too.

143
00:08:38,004 --> 00:08:39,573
MATT: How's that go, again?

144
00:08:39,573 --> 00:08:45,969
SAM: Yoyotoki Happy Ears. It's really weird and
funny, and it's actually really awesome.

145
00:08:46,002 --> 00:08:51,236
TRAVIS: Also, Halo 5 is out this week, which Laura
and I are in. It's amazing.

146
00:08:51,236 --> 00:08:52,899
LIAM: I'm not familiar with that. What is that?

147
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:55,424
TRAVIS: It's some game. Takes place in outer
space.

148
00:08:55,424 --> 00:08:58,137
LIAM: Is that a match three? Like Bejeweled?

149
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:01,520
TRAVIS: It's like Candy Crush, but with more
death.

150
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,670
TALIESIN: That's available on Android.

151
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:09,807
MATT: The last announcement is that they announced
that The Witcher is coming to theaters in a couple

152
00:09:09,807 --> 00:09:13,016
of years, and that has nothing to do with us,
other than the fact that I'm probably going to be

153
00:09:13,016 --> 00:09:16,982
at full mast for the next week, thinking of that
possibility.

154
00:09:16,982 --> 00:09:18,657
TRAVIS: Said so casually.

155
00:09:18,657 --> 00:09:19,991
LAURA: Yeah.

156
00:09:19,991 --> 00:09:23,985
MATT: I'm so excited. Please don't fuck it up.

157
00:09:23,985 --> 00:09:26,532
TRAVIS: They will. It'll be Mark Wahlberg.

158
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:28,421
MATT: No, no, no!

159
00:09:28,421 --> 00:09:32,801
MARISHA: Channing Tatum.

160
00:09:32,801 --> 00:09:34,048
LIAM: Will Ferrell.

161
00:09:34,048 --> 00:09:36,045
MATT: I will... I would not!

162
00:09:36,045 --> 00:09:37,609
MARISHA: Channing Tatum is Geralt of Rivia.

163
00:09:37,609 --> 00:09:39,443
LAURA: Done! Let's make this happen.

164
00:09:39,443 --> 00:09:47,988
MATT: Don't. Guys, I will stop this show. Your DM
is out! If Channing Tatum becomes Geralt, I will

165
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:56,885
be so furious. He's great at certain roles. I
loved him in... I absolutely adored him in the 21

166
00:09:56,885 --> 00:09:58,253
Jump Street movies.

167
00:09:58,253 --> 00:10:04,132
SAM: I guess he's not coming on our show, jeez.

168
00:10:04,132 --> 00:10:11,260
MATT: That's enough of our silly talk. Let's go
ahead and dive into the chaos that is the current

169
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:17,502
circumstance. Keep in mind, the culmination of
leading into Halloween with this story arc and now

170
00:10:17,502 --> 00:10:21,992
going and starting a rebellion in Whitestone on
the Fifth of November has been a very delightful,

171
00:10:21,992 --> 00:10:24,844
unintentional coordination here.

172
00:10:24,844 --> 00:10:29,179
TALIESIN: I almost wore my special spider belt,
too, but it felt too weird.

173
00:10:29,179 --> 00:10:34,581
MATT: So that's pretty cool. So to get you guys up
to speed with the circumstance that has

174
00:10:34,581 --> 00:10:40,837
happened, those especially that are tuning in for
the first time. A couple known as the Briarwoods

175
00:10:40,881 --> 00:10:49,001
that took over the city of Whitestone five years before,
murdering most of the ruling family of Percy--

176
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:54,994
other than himself, escaping-- have recently been
doing political discussions with the home city of

177
00:10:54,994 --> 00:11:02,267
Emon. Vox Machina, our troop of intrepid
adventurers, upon discovering this, battled them

178
00:11:02,267 --> 00:11:08,609
at Emon. They fled to Whitestone, and the party
has then gone after to seek to destroy them and

179
00:11:08,609 --> 00:11:10,991
free the town, the once-home to Percival.

180
00:11:10,991 --> 00:11:16,465
In the process, it appears that there have been a number of
warnings set, and the entire town has been long

181
00:11:16,497 --> 00:11:24,017
held under this dark, ominous rule that they have
kept at bay. Apparently, they have found notes of

182
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:29,842
previous, failed rebellions, and things that die
here don't seem to stay dead. A number of

183
00:11:29,842 --> 00:11:35,465
zombified giants are wandering the city as these
giant lurching sentinels. And apparently, a number

184
00:11:35,465 --> 00:11:39,746
of the cutthroats that helped the Briarwoods come
to power in this town have now been given titles

185
00:11:39,746 --> 00:11:42,966
and land here and are now called the new nobles by
the locals.

186
00:11:42,966 --> 00:11:50,499
During this process, you guys managed to sneak
into the town, began setting out word of coming

187
00:11:50,499 --> 00:11:57,120
rebellion and that Percival de Rolo has returned
and the Briarwoods' time is numbered. Upon meeting

188
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:03,633
the previous chancellor to your father of the
town, Archibald, you guys came to an

189
00:12:03,633 --> 00:12:09,519
understanding, and he was going to reach out to
all of his contacts and let them know that the

190
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,972
rebellion is happening. You guys then set out to
set a two-pronged attack against two of the

191
00:12:14,013 --> 00:12:21,374
remaining new nobles in the town. Most of the
party going to seek the outside of Count-- what's

192
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:22,587
his name?

193
00:12:22,587 --> 00:12:23,880
TRAVIS and LAURA: Count Dooku.

194
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,084
MARISHA: Count Duke.

195
00:12:27,084 --> 00:12:33,487
MATT: Duke Vedmeyer was the one that Scanlan went
to, and then Tylieri is the one that the rest of

196
00:12:33,487 --> 00:12:41,085
you wandered outside. Now, as the rain pours down
into the city, midday. Scanlan decided to open

197
00:12:41,085 --> 00:12:51,252
from a Polymorph spell, as a fly, to the top of
the front doorstep of Vedmeyer's home. Then,

198
00:12:51,252 --> 00:12:57,494
proceeding to un-Polymorph and re-Polymorph into a
triceratops. Of which, I have your statistics here

199
00:12:57,494 --> 00:12:59,721
for your triceratops form, if you want to come get
that.

200
00:12:59,721 --> 00:13:02,261
MARISHA: Go get them stats, boy!

201
00:13:02,261 --> 00:13:06,425
TALIESIN AND MARISHA: (chanting) Stats, stats,
stats!

202
00:13:06,425 --> 00:13:16,459
MATT: So that's your triceratops form. After
becoming a triceratops, you squashed the front

203
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:19,877
guard that was there, you slammed through the
front of the building, destroying the front door,

204
00:13:19,877 --> 00:13:26,804
and we cut to the other group who is stealthing
through the rain. At which point, the okay was

205
00:13:26,804 --> 00:13:32,465
given to Grog, whether intentionally or not. Grog
then charged to the front door of Tylieri's

206
00:13:32,465 --> 00:13:36,906
estate, and the rest of you prepared for impact.
And that was where we left off, in the center of

207
00:13:36,906 --> 00:13:38,014
this chaos.

208
00:13:38,014 --> 00:13:39,706
LIAM: Let's do this!

209
00:13:39,706 --> 00:13:41,858
LAURA: Oh, god.

210
00:13:41,961 --> 00:13:45,201
MATT: So without further ado. Sam.

211
00:13:45,201 --> 00:13:50,282
SAM: But I was just handed this.

212
00:13:50,282 --> 00:13:51,956
MATT: I know, take a look.

213
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,769
TRAVIS: Sucks to be first!

214
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:58,075
LIAM: He's got the maps out already. Get your shit
together, man.

215
00:13:58,075 --> 00:14:00,477
SAM: I've never been a triceratops before.

216
00:14:00,477 --> 00:14:01,983
LIAM: That's not what I heard.

217
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:12,475
SAM: All right, you're right. Think like a triceratops.
So, I need shelter. I don't know. How do

218
00:14:12,578 --> 00:14:15,375
triceratopses think?

219
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:19,188
TALIESIN: Probably like punk rock hippopotamuses.

220
00:14:19,188 --> 00:14:21,512
SAM: Hip-hop-ipotimi.

221
00:14:21,512 --> 00:14:30,350
MATT: Say, for the sake of this, for now, we'll go
through your circumstance, as they are separate.

222
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:38,330
So Scanlan, you are-- I did not have a
triceratops, but I did have a stegosaurus. It's

223
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:41,501
the same size. I'm sorry, bloodspike behemoth.

224
00:14:41,501 --> 00:14:43,079
TALIESIN: That's kind of racist.

225
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:46,213
MATT: I'm sorry. You know what? They're not around
to argue.

226
00:14:46,213 --> 00:14:49,995
TRAVIS: That you know of.

227
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:54,954
TALIESIN: We are going to get a bunch of angry
tweets from stegosauruses and triceratops.

228
00:14:54,954 --> 00:15:01,213
MATT: I'm sure. Please, bring them my way. As you
slam your way into the front of Duke Vedmeyer's

229
00:15:01,213 --> 00:15:06,380
estate. Pieces of wood blasting outward,
scattering among the center of the foyer. You see

230
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:10,126
before you a rising staircase that divides into
two separate staircases that curl around to the

231
00:15:10,126 --> 00:15:11,355
second level.

232
00:15:11,479 --> 00:15:13,431
SAM: Lovely decor.

233
00:15:13,431 --> 00:15:23,948
MATT: You also notice that the entire
interior is currently filled with guards. All

234
00:15:23,948 --> 00:15:31,706
seemingly prepared and almost expecting your
arrival.

235
00:15:31,706 --> 00:15:36,222
SAM: I think I can take them, guys. I think I can
take them.

236
00:15:36,222 --> 00:15:43,187
MATT: You also see, at the top, Duke Vedmeyer
himself. A large, hairless, grey-skinned goliath,

237
00:15:43,187 --> 00:15:46,979
wielding a giant two-handed sword, armored with a
breastplate.

238
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,679
MARISHA: Vecmeyer?

239
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:49,724
MATT: Vedmeyer.

240
00:15:49,724 --> 00:15:50,798
LAURA: He's a goliath?

241
00:15:50,798 --> 00:15:51,992
MATT: He's a goliath, yeah.

242
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,236
MARISHA: Vedmeyer is a goliath?

243
00:15:53,236 --> 00:16:00,772
SAM: Wow, that's going to be fun later, but not
right now. Okay, do I know? So, let's assess my

244
00:16:00,772 --> 00:16:07,133
knowledge real quick. I know about him a little
bit. He is one of the thugs that came into the city.

245
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,120
MATT: Correct.

246
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,447
SAM: He is not a magic-wielder, as far as I know.

247
00:16:11,447 --> 00:16:16,012
MATT: As far as you know, no. And at first glance,
based on the fact that he is wearing heavy

248
00:16:16,012 --> 00:16:19,672
breastplate and is wielding a giant two-handed
sword, you get the feeling he is probably not as

249
00:16:19,672 --> 00:16:22,706
heavily inclined towards the arcane arts as others
you have encountered.

250
00:16:22,706 --> 00:16:31,473
SAM: As I quickly survey the room, do I see anyone
else who is a threat greater than a heavily armed

251
00:16:31,473 --> 00:16:36,472
guard? Anything that is a creepy wizard or a weird
old mage?

252
00:16:36,504 --> 00:16:41,510
MATT: Currently, no. Currently, all you see are a
series of Whitestone guards in uniform armor, all

253
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:46,218
with heavy crossbows, currently nocked. And as you
come blasting through the door, they are already

254
00:16:46,218 --> 00:16:51,427
arranged in what appears to be a waiting pattern,
should anything try and charge its way into the house.

255
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,341
SAM: So they'll probably all shoot me, won't
they?

256
00:16:53,341 --> 00:16:54,952
MATT: In fact, roll initiative.

257
00:16:54,952 --> 00:16:58,261
SAM: So directly in front of me, there's a
staircase going up?

258
00:16:58,261 --> 00:16:59,180
MATT: Yep.

259
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,617
SAM: Any other doors or exits?

260
00:17:00,617 --> 00:17:04,486
MATT: There are doors on each side that are
currently locked, and other than that, no.

261
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:06,142
SAM: Those are locked doors?

262
00:17:06,142 --> 00:17:10,739
MATT: They are closed currently, and they appear
to be-- There's a giant wooden beam crossed over

263
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:14,221
the front of each. Then there's the outside which
leads to the exterior, to the raining outside of

264
00:17:14,321 --> 00:17:16,346
the household, and the stairs that go up.

265
00:17:16,346 --> 00:17:17,444
SAM: Oh, man.

266
00:17:17,444 --> 00:17:18,370
MATT: Roll initiative.

267
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:22,062
SAM: Initiative? Don't I get a surprise round?
Doesn't matter. 21.

268
00:17:22,062 --> 00:17:24,600
MATT: Okay.

269
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,859
SAM: I don't get a surprise round because I sprung
in there?

270
00:17:28,859 --> 00:17:30,033
MATT: Apparently not.

271
00:17:30,033 --> 00:17:31,174
SAM: Damn it.

272
00:17:31,174 --> 00:17:34,259
MATT: You made a very loud noise when you turned
into a triceratops and tore through the front of

273
00:17:34,259 --> 00:17:39,485
the household. All right, so Scanlan is up first.

274
00:17:39,485 --> 00:17:46,417
SAM: So here's the thing. Here's the thing. I
should probably leave.

275
00:17:46,417 --> 00:17:47,406
TRAVIS: Yeah, come on.

276
00:17:47,406 --> 00:17:50,944
SAM: But come on. I'm a triceratops! I've got to
have some fun first, right?

277
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,849
TRAVIS: You can take a couple of hit points,
right?

278
00:17:52,849 --> 00:17:54,218
SAM: Right?!

279
00:17:54,218 --> 00:17:55,705
TALIESIN: I think you revert back to normal.

280
00:17:55,705 --> 00:17:57,985
MARISHA: Does Polymorph carry over?

281
00:17:57,985 --> 00:18:03,031
MATT: If you go to zero hit points in animal form,
you go back to your regular full health and any

282
00:18:03,031 --> 00:18:05,320
damage that carries over just goes to your regular
health, at that point.

283
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,531
LAURA: That's a lot of people.

284
00:18:06,531 --> 00:18:07,955
MARISHA: You have 115 hit points.

285
00:18:07,955 --> 00:18:09,309
MATT: You guys aren't there. Scanlan, what are you
doing?

286
00:18:09,309 --> 00:18:12,142
TRAVIS: (sings Jurassic Park theme)

287
00:18:12,142 --> 00:18:17,406
(others join in)

288
00:18:17,524 --> 00:18:19,144
MATT: What are you doing?

289
00:18:19,144 --> 00:18:20,344
SAM: Wait, it's my turn first?

290
00:18:20,344 --> 00:18:21,531
MATT: Yeah, you have initiative, man.

291
00:18:21,531 --> 00:18:22,881
SAM: I beat them with initiative?

292
00:18:22,881 --> 00:18:23,839
MATT: You did.

293
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:26,948
SAM: They are more than my charging distance as a
triceratops, right?

294
00:18:26,948 --> 00:18:29,289
MATT: He's the only one that's within,
technically. What's your speed?

295
00:18:29,289 --> 00:18:30,449
SAM: 40.

296
00:18:30,449 --> 00:18:34,389
MATT: 40. You would get right up to Vedmeyer if
you were to charge.

297
00:18:34,389 --> 00:18:35,835
SAM: I would be dead.

298
00:18:35,835 --> 00:18:37,936
TRAVIS: No, you wouldn't. You got it. Go stick
him!

299
00:18:37,936 --> 00:18:39,587
MATT: What do you want to do?

300
00:18:39,587 --> 00:18:46,595
SAM: I'm going to go-- How far away are the doors
on the sides?

301
00:18:46,595 --> 00:18:49,267
MATT: Over here? It's about 35 feet.

302
00:18:49,267 --> 00:18:52,468
SAM: I'm going to turn right and blast through
that door.

303
00:18:52,468 --> 00:18:55,014
(laughter)

304
00:18:55,014 --> 00:18:58,306
MATT: Okay!

305
00:18:58,306 --> 00:19:06,051
SAM: Oh shit, it could be trapped. Well, we'll
find out.

306
00:19:06,051 --> 00:19:10,174
LIAM: Expect the unexpected with Scanlan
Shorthalt.

307
00:19:10,174 --> 00:19:13,126
MATT: He goes blasting through the doors.

308
00:19:13,126 --> 00:19:15,228
SAM: Do I have to roll to blast through the
doors?

309
00:19:15,228 --> 00:19:18,678
MATT: We are going to find out. Yeah, go ahead and
roll a strength check. Roll a d20 and add your

310
00:19:18,733 --> 00:19:20,845
strength modifier of the triceratops form.

311
00:19:20,845 --> 00:19:24,340
SAM: Okay, strength modifier says plus five. So
that's only a 17.

312
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:27,238
LAURA: For a door!

313
00:19:27,238 --> 00:19:30,625
SAM: Me and doors don't get along too well.

314
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:36,412
MATT: You, running, slam your head in,
through, the horns protruding and tearing through

315
00:19:36,412 --> 00:19:39,582
the wood. The doors break inward, but the doors
don't fully blast inward.

316
00:19:39,615 --> 00:19:41,403
SAM: The door beat me!

317
00:19:41,403 --> 00:19:46,848
MATT: The door is in bad shape. It won't take much
more power to blast through.

318
00:19:46,848 --> 00:19:48,350
SAM: These fucking doors.

319
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,951
MATT: It's now your worst nemesis.

320
00:19:50,951 --> 00:19:53,449
SAM: So now I am stuck in a door?

321
00:19:53,449 --> 00:19:58,915
MATT: You could try and pull back out. You manage
to pull out without an issue. The doors are mostly

322
00:19:58,915 --> 00:20:02,509
beaten inward. It will take but a small impact to
blast through next turn, if you wanted to.

323
00:20:02,509 --> 00:20:06,186
SAM: Next turn? Do I still have an action after
this?

324
00:20:06,186 --> 00:20:08,126
MATT: That would have been your action.

325
00:20:08,126 --> 00:20:12,381
TRAVIS: You're great! You're money. You're good.

326
00:20:12,381 --> 00:20:14,602
LAURA: Every single one of those guys can attack
you now.

327
00:20:14,602 --> 00:20:16,375
SAM: Yeah, but it probably won't happen.

328
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:17,935
TRAVIS: Maybe they didn't see you.

329
00:20:17,935 --> 00:20:19,132
LAURA: Run away.

330
00:20:19,132 --> 00:20:23,566
SAM: It's not my turn anymore, right? That's it.

331
00:20:23,607 --> 00:20:24,778
MATT: That's your turn.

332
00:20:24,778 --> 00:20:25,680
LAURA: No!

333
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,379
SAM: My triceratops ass is sticking out.

334
00:20:27,379 --> 00:20:28,523
MATT: Just right there.

335
00:20:28,523 --> 00:20:30,751
TRAVIS: Look, they're all dummies. They're just
mannequins.

336
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:36,574
MATT: This guy moves up over the railing with his
heavy crossbow and aims this way. These guys all

337
00:20:36,574 --> 00:20:38,624
shift to this side with their crossbows.

338
00:20:38,624 --> 00:20:41,464
SAM: I'm going to die.

339
00:20:41,464 --> 00:20:46,733
MATT: Over here, this guy's going to move to this
point so he can get a view of you. And Vedmeyer is

340
00:20:46,733 --> 00:20:52,964
going to move down here and get his sword ready,
grinning. As he holds his sword up, he puts his

341
00:20:53,105 --> 00:21:00,896
hand up and goes, "Aim, fire!" A bunch of crossbow
bolts get loosed at once (shh, shh) through the

342
00:21:00,896 --> 00:21:03,720
middle of the room. What's your armor class as the
triceratops?

343
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,128
SAM: I have no idea. 14?!

344
00:21:06,128 --> 00:21:15,709
MATT: 11, that misses. That's a 13, misses.

345
00:21:15,709 --> 00:21:17,509
SAM: Wow, these guys suck.

346
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:19,148
TALIESIN: They are like stormtroopers.

347
00:21:19,148 --> 00:21:20,756
MATT: Natural one.

348
00:21:20,756 --> 00:21:23,469
TALIESIN: They are! You are being attacked by
stormtroopers.

349
00:21:23,469 --> 00:21:37,105
MATT: That's going to be a 14, hits. 18, hits. 24,
hits. That was six?

350
00:21:37,105 --> 00:21:38,780
SAM: That was six.

351
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,936
TRAVIS: Three hits.

352
00:21:39,936 --> 00:21:43,888
MATT: One more, that's a 22. So I have four that
actually hit you with the crossbow bolts.

353
00:21:43,888 --> 00:21:45,459
TALIESIN: You're fine.

354
00:21:45,459 --> 00:21:46,550
SAM: Yeah.

355
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,641
TRAVIS: You're now a porcupine triceratops.

356
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,479
LAURA: You have 115 hit points.

357
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:53,069
SAM: I have 115 hit points?!

358
00:21:53,069 --> 00:21:55,793
TALIESIN: And when those go out, you are back to
human hit points.

359
00:21:55,793 --> 00:22:03,520
MATT: That's eight piercing damage. 13 piercing
damage. 21.

360
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,148
LAURA: Are you immune to any kind of damage?

361
00:22:06,148 --> 00:22:12,209
MATT: 25. 34 points of piercing damage from this 
volley.

362
00:22:12,251 --> 00:22:14,675
LIAM: Is there resistance to anything on there?

363
00:22:14,675 --> 00:22:15,781
MATT: Nope.

364
00:22:15,781 --> 00:22:24,094
SAM: What does that take me down to? 81? Is that
right? 115 minus 34, 81?

365
00:22:24,094 --> 00:22:25,835
TALIESIN: Sounds about right.

366
00:22:25,835 --> 00:22:27,508
SAM: Okay.

367
00:22:27,508 --> 00:22:30,564
MATT: All right. That brings us back to the top of
the initiative round, and you're up.

368
00:22:30,564 --> 00:22:33,720
SAM: Well, shit, then I've got to get some
retribution.

369
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,561
TRAVIS: Totally. Turn around and give it to them.

370
00:22:36,561 --> 00:22:39,612
SAM: Am I considered flanked?

371
00:22:39,612 --> 00:22:40,854
MATT: You are not.

372
00:22:40,854 --> 00:22:41,891
SAM: Damn it.

373
00:22:41,891 --> 00:22:44,533
TRAVIS: You do have a tail.

374
00:22:44,533 --> 00:22:46,505
SAM: I do have a tail.

375
00:22:46,505 --> 00:22:48,509
MARISHA: You are like a drunk guy at a craps
table.

376
00:22:48,509 --> 00:22:50,841
SAM: I don't know how to hit things. I've never
hit things before.

377
00:22:50,841 --> 00:22:52,724
LIAM: There's the door you mangled in front of
you.

378
00:22:52,724 --> 00:22:56,255
SAM: Okay, I'm going to gore that guy to my left.

379
00:22:56,255 --> 00:22:58,521
MATT: He is above you on the railing.

380
00:22:58,521 --> 00:23:01,991
SAM: Oh, that's a balcony. I thought that was a
stairway down.

381
00:23:01,991 --> 00:23:05,199
MATT: I'm sorry, this is a balcony up
top. So he's actually aiming down and firing at you.

382
00:23:05,332 --> 00:23:07,627
LAURA: Then just go through the door.

383
00:23:07,627 --> 00:23:08,964
SAM: I'm going through the door.

384
00:23:08,964 --> 00:23:12,156
MATT: All right, then roll another strength
check.

385
00:23:12,156 --> 00:23:16,656
SAM: Yeah, because I'm not tangling with Duke
Vedmeyer or whatever. 23.

386
00:23:16,656 --> 00:23:21,146
MATT: 23, not a problem. You burst through.

387
00:23:21,146 --> 00:23:24,282
TALIESIN: We're going off the map.

388
00:23:24,282 --> 00:23:26,541
LIAM: Hey, you guys!

389
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:30,130
MARISHA: He's taking them off the grid.

390
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:34,064
TALIESIN AND MARISHA: He doesn't have a social
security number!

391
00:23:34,064 --> 00:23:38,515
MATT: So what you see in here, as you blast
through. It's a dining room with a central dining

392
00:23:38,515 --> 00:23:45,871
room table, two small tables in the far corners.
There is a ten-foot window across the way. It

393
00:23:45,871 --> 00:23:48,014
appears to be a normal dining room set.

394
00:23:48,014 --> 00:23:49,596
SAM: Is that my action?

395
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:50,772
MATT: That is your movement.

396
00:23:50,772 --> 00:23:51,913
SAM: That's my movement?

397
00:23:51,913 --> 00:23:55,409
MATT: Yeah, I'd say at this point it is so damaged
that it doesn't take much effort to push through,

398
00:23:55,409 --> 00:23:57,373
so you can manage to push through as part of your
movement.

399
00:23:57,373 --> 00:23:58,618
SAM: Okay.

400
00:23:58,618 --> 00:24:04,359
TALIESIN: You could pick 'em off as they run
through. I'm not helping. I'm sorry.

401
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:05,934
MATT: Nope, you guys aren't there.

402
00:24:06,098 --> 00:24:07,499
TALIESIN: Not there. Shutting up.

403
00:24:07,499 --> 00:24:10,301
SAM: (whispers) I should get out of there. But
it's so fun.

404
00:24:10,301 --> 00:24:11,803
MATT: What do you want to do, Scanlan?

405
00:24:11,803 --> 00:24:13,891
SAM: So, I am in the room. No one is in there with
me.

406
00:24:13,891 --> 00:24:14,885
MATT: Correct.

407
00:24:14,885 --> 00:24:18,730
SAM: So where's this laser pointer?

408
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:24,623
TALIESIN: You can also hold your action. Just as
an option. Not to help, but you can hold your action.

409
00:24:24,623 --> 00:24:36,858
SAM: So, yeah. I'll just position myself right
next to the the door there, and I will hold my

410
00:24:36,858 --> 00:24:40,687
attack until anyone runs through the door. They
get an insta-gore.

411
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:50,889
MATT: Okay, good to know. Holding an action. The
next turn will be Vedmeyer.

412
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:54,366
SAM: Oh shit, here he comes. Here he comes. It's
me and the big guy.

413
00:24:54,366 --> 00:25:00,393
MATT: Holds up there. He is going to wait there.
He's actually going to dash and just get up right

414
00:25:00,393 --> 00:25:04,796
next to where the doors are burst open. He can
hear you right around the corner. The rest of

415
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:07,065
these guys are going to dash in.

416
00:25:07,065 --> 00:25:13,279
SAM: Oh god. I think I can take them, guys.

417
00:25:13,383 --> 00:25:19,271
MATT: There, there, there. This guy is going to
just try and jump down. Let's see if he makes his

418
00:25:19,322 --> 00:25:27,860
acrobatics. He does not, with his armor. He leaps
off the edge and manages to damage his ankle and

419
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:35,730
is currently prone on the ground. That ends their
turn. Back at the top. Are you still holding your

420
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:37,560
action on your turn now? It's back to you.

421
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,126
SAM: Okay. Tell me this, did I hear a bunch of
footsteps? Can I hear?

422
00:25:40,126 --> 00:25:42,516
MATT: You heard a bunch of footsteps coming in,
yeah.

423
00:25:42,516 --> 00:25:55,383
SAM: (sighs) All right, I'm not good at fighting.
I will--

424
00:25:55,383 --> 00:25:57,081
LAURA: Can you set a blaze?

425
00:25:57,081 --> 00:26:04,589
SAM: I don't have any fire. I don't know why I was
sent into this mission. I don't do fire things. I

426
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:07,129
will drop my form. Is that an action?

427
00:26:07,129 --> 00:26:08,490
LAURA: You have a lantern!

428
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:09,953
MATT: You can drop it in a moment.

429
00:26:09,953 --> 00:26:11,384
MARISHA: Don't you have a torch?

430
00:26:11,384 --> 00:26:16,836
MATT: The triceratops shrinks down to gnomish form
now, in this partially destroyed dining room area.

431
00:26:16,836 --> 00:26:18,927
What are you doing?

432
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:21,933
SAM: I'm going to-- hold on.

433
00:26:21,933 --> 00:26:24,197
MARISHA: How did this plan happen, then?

434
00:26:24,197 --> 00:26:26,564
TRAVIS: Because we're a bunch of slap-dicks,
that's why!

435
00:26:26,564 --> 00:26:31,963
MARISHA: Why didn't you say I don't have fire?! I
said, "Hey Scanlan, I should come with you," and

436
00:26:31,963 --> 00:26:37,663
you said, "I can take care of myself. How many
times do I have to tell you guys? I don't need

437
00:26:37,663 --> 00:26:38,847
"your help."

438
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,957
MATT: The echoing voice you hear, in the back of
your mind, as you imagine this is what Keyleth

439
00:26:41,957 --> 00:26:44,071
would be saying right now.

440
00:26:44,071 --> 00:26:52,090
MARISHA: Dorito's a failure, you guys.

441
00:26:52,236 --> 00:27:02,491
SAM: Yeah, okay. I peek around the corner a little
bit. Just make sure they're all there, and I will

442
00:27:02,491 --> 00:27:04,532
Stinking Cloud all of them.

443
00:27:04,532 --> 00:27:06,026
MATT: Okay!

444
00:27:06,026 --> 00:27:09,723
LIAM: Why are you not Dimension Door-ing out of
there?

445
00:27:09,723 --> 00:27:14,994
SAM: I've got to have some fun first. How often am
I going to take on a whole house by myself?

446
00:27:14,994 --> 00:27:17,339
TRAVIS: I like it. I'm so in love with you right
now.

447
00:27:17,339 --> 00:27:19,002
TALIESIN: I approve of this plan.

448
00:27:19,002 --> 00:27:28,948
MATT: All right. 20-foot radius sphere. I'd say
you could affect all of them, yeah. All of them in

449
00:27:28,948 --> 00:27:37,712
this big ol' Stinking Cloud radius. Not a worry.
This whole area fills up with gas. All right. All

450
00:27:37,786 --> 00:27:43,424
of a sudden, the entire foyer just fills up with
this greenish, noxious cloud of poisonous gas.

451
00:27:43,424 --> 00:27:47,265
Let's see. They have to make a constitution save.

452
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:50,223
LIAM: Get the goliath. Get that goliath.

453
00:27:50,223 --> 00:27:53,352
MATT: What's the DC? Is this through your hand
cone?

454
00:27:53,352 --> 00:27:55,633
SAM: Oh, for sure it is. So 19.

455
00:27:55,633 --> 00:28:11,760
MATT: (laughing) 19? Jesus Christ. Okay. Nope.
Nope. Nope. Nope. Natural 20, he's fine. 19, he's

456
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:22,593
fine. 18, nope. Nope. Double nope, because he's on
the ground. Fuck that guy. Vedmeyer rolls a one.

457
00:28:22,593 --> 00:28:25,326
(cheering)

458
00:28:25,326 --> 00:28:35,375
MATT: All right, so these two guys immediately
cover their mouths and pull up this little bit of

459
00:28:35,375 --> 00:28:38,467
material they have around their chest plate armor
to cover their mouth. The rest of them start

460
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:43,324
(coughs) hacking up. One of them starts vomiting
all over the ground, and he has a helmet on, so it's

461
00:28:43,324 --> 00:28:45,516
straining through. It's awful.

462
00:28:45,639 --> 00:28:46,951
(groaning)

463
00:28:46,951 --> 00:28:51,662
MATT: Vedmeyer himself kind of backs against the
wall and (groans) just tries to get it to leave

464
00:28:51,662 --> 00:28:57,467
the area, but it's just this thick cloud.
It's slowly moving away. Yeah, they are in a bad

465
00:28:57,503 --> 00:29:03,970
place right now. Okay, and you still have
movement. You have only moved five feet so far.

466
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:06,006
TRAVIS: Is Stinking Cloud methane-based?

467
00:29:06,006 --> 00:29:11,152
SAM: (laughs) It is the way I do it. I can still
move?

468
00:29:11,152 --> 00:29:13,867
MATT: Yeah, you only moved five feet so far, so
you still have 20 feet of movement.

469
00:29:13,867 --> 00:29:16,697
SAM: Okay, I'll do a Dukes of Hazzard over the
table.

470
00:29:16,697 --> 00:29:17,891
MATT: All right.

471
00:29:17,891 --> 00:29:20,221
TRAVIS: Unnecessarily.

472
00:29:20,221 --> 00:29:24,511
SAM: Do I have to make an athletics check or
anything for that?

473
00:29:24,511 --> 00:29:26,829
MATT: Do an acrobatics to see how cool it was.

474
00:29:26,829 --> 00:29:28,306
MARISHA: See how cool it was!

475
00:29:28,306 --> 00:29:30,121
SAM: Acrobatics?

476
00:29:30,121 --> 00:29:31,103
MATT: Yes.

477
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:32,711
SAM: What do I do for that?

478
00:29:32,711 --> 00:29:33,861
LIAM: You got a number.

479
00:29:33,861 --> 00:29:36,070
SAM: I know, but I don't do these things. 11.

480
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:43,091
MATT: 11. You (grunts) you slide, only because you
partially destroyed it as a triceratops, (ssss)

481
00:29:43,091 --> 00:29:46,925
but in your head it looked pretty cool. Thank god
none of your allies were around to actually

482
00:29:46,925 --> 00:29:49,051
witness it, but you heard the theme music.

483
00:29:49,051 --> 00:29:51,561
SAM: Okay, yes. So I'm near the window now,
right?

484
00:29:51,561 --> 00:29:52,880
MATT: Yeah, you're right by the window.

485
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,606
SAM: Okay, and that's, I guess, everything.
Right?

486
00:29:54,606 --> 00:29:55,471
MATT: Yeah.

487
00:29:55,471 --> 00:29:56,232
SAM: Okay.

488
00:29:56,232 --> 00:30:03,172
MATT: Okay. Your turn ends. Vedmeyer is just-- you
can see his eyes are filling up with liquid. He

489
00:30:03,172 --> 00:30:11,155
does make his saving throw. He coughs. (coughs)
Manages to clear the air around him. You can see

490
00:30:11,205 --> 00:30:16,139
the cloud slowly moving back this way, away from
where it was cast. That finishes his turn.

491
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:20,389
However, he is no longer affected by the Stinking
Cloud. You can see as the cloud slowly moves past

492
00:30:20,389 --> 00:30:25,512
him, and his face comes through, his pupil-less,
angry goliath eyes are staring at you from across

493
00:30:25,512 --> 00:30:31,988
the room to where the doors are open. You see him
grit his teeth and (growls). You can hear his

494
00:30:31,988 --> 00:30:37,055
teeth scratching across themselves in anger and
fury.

495
00:30:37,055 --> 00:30:38,753
SAM: I'm shaking.

496
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:47,084
MATT: The rest of them are going to go. These two
guys are going to move forward. They both come

497
00:30:47,084 --> 00:30:51,832
running in, putting another bolt into their
crossbows, (clicking) pulling it back real fast,

498
00:30:51,832 --> 00:30:56,481
pulling up their heavy crossbows, and firing at
you. That is going to be a 24.

499
00:30:56,481 --> 00:30:58,410
SAM: Well, that hits. Of course it does.

500
00:30:58,410 --> 00:30:59,914
MATT: And an 18.

501
00:30:59,914 --> 00:31:01,713
SAM: Against what?

502
00:31:01,713 --> 00:31:03,001
LAURA: Your AC!

503
00:31:03,001 --> 00:31:04,256
SAM: Oh yeah, that hits.

504
00:31:04,256 --> 00:31:11,875
MATT: So you take 12 points of piercing damage
from the first bolt and five points of piercing

505
00:31:11,875 --> 00:31:17,280
damage from the second. As both (zoomf, zoomf)
bolts, one hits you in the shoulder and ricochets

506
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:21,182
off, not doing much damage. The other one slams
and actually embeds itself into your thigh, about

507
00:31:21,182 --> 00:31:25,112
an inch into it. It's piercing and
sticking out the other side. Mostly caught armor,

508
00:31:25,112 --> 00:31:27,693
but you can feel it definitely got a chunk of
flesh in the process.

509
00:31:27,693 --> 00:31:28,850
LAURA: Oh no.

510
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:29,891
SAM: Okay.

511
00:31:29,891 --> 00:31:31,949
MATT: That ends their turn. The rest of these
guys, now, are going to try and make their saving

512
00:31:31,949 --> 00:31:41,903
throw. Fail. Fail. Fail. No, success on him,
actually. He rolled a 19. A success on a natural

513
00:31:41,903 --> 00:31:49,148
19. Fail. Fail. Well, no, actually these three
succeed. The rest of them are still down. So I'll

514
00:31:49,148 --> 00:31:58,751
say that these guys here are all down. And he's
still up. These two are still down. Okay. That

515
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:00,496
ends their turn, you're up.

516
00:32:00,496 --> 00:32:03,682
SAM: I so want to get some payback, but I
shouldn't, right?

517
00:32:03,682 --> 00:32:05,493
LIAM: G-T-F-O!

518
00:32:05,493 --> 00:32:07,749
SAM: I think I can take these guys.

519
00:32:07,749 --> 00:32:12,428
MATT: That is a hell of a Lightning Bolt line,
right there.

520
00:32:12,428 --> 00:32:14,075
SAM: How big is that diameter?

521
00:32:14,075 --> 00:32:18,448
MATT: It's about six feet across.

522
00:32:18,448 --> 00:32:19,982
SAM: Oh, I can't lift that thing.

523
00:32:19,982 --> 00:32:28,250
MATT: No, it's a big, long table. You have a very
wide line of individuals, right there. All ready

524
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,595
to snatch you.

525
00:32:29,595 --> 00:32:32,798
SAM: All right, one more round. What do you say,
guys?

526
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:34,305
TRAVIS and LIAM: We're not here.

527
00:32:34,305 --> 00:32:44,150
SAM: One more round. I am going to-- fuck. Do I
have line-of-sight on the door?

528
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:48,460
MATT: The door is right here. So you're by the
window. So if you wanted to move over here, then

529
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:51,085
you would have line of sight on pretty much
everybody.

530
00:32:51,085 --> 00:32:52,673
SAM: Yeah, that would be so fun.

531
00:32:52,673 --> 00:32:57,315
TALIESIN: You could move and then move back. I'm
only helping with gameplay strategy.

532
00:32:57,315 --> 00:32:58,987
SAM: He could brain me.

533
00:32:58,987 --> 00:32:59,879
TRAVIS: He could.

534
00:32:59,879 --> 00:33:06,450
SAM: He could brain me in one shot. Okay. I will
duck under the table so they think that's where I

535
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:09,509
went, and then Dimension Door to the roof.

536
00:33:09,509 --> 00:33:16,294
MATT: Okay! You duck under the table. I'm going to
say make a deception roll to try and successfully

537
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:17,794
feint them.

538
00:33:17,794 --> 00:33:19,925
SAM: Oh, okay.

539
00:33:19,925 --> 00:33:22,578
LIAM: Can they see the top of his head behind the
table?

540
00:33:22,682 --> 00:33:25,609
MATT: From their direction it's kind of hard.
Especially because there's a table and chairs up

541
00:33:25,609 --> 00:33:30,141
against it, and part of it has been crushed by a
triceratops that was previously here.

542
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:31,862
LIAM: "Oh, I'm going under the table."

543
00:33:31,967 --> 00:33:33,647
TALIESIN: Sentences you never expect to hear in
your D&amp;D game.

544
00:33:33,647 --> 00:33:35,061
SAM: 31.

545
00:33:35,061 --> 00:33:40,567
MATT: So you grab your head. Oh no! Do a very
elaborate dive under the table.

546
00:33:40,567 --> 00:33:42,714
SAM: Here I go under the table!

547
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:46,519
MATT: A little strange dull thud of arcane energy
as you bamf up to the ceiling.

548
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:48,257
SAM: Okay, great.

549
00:33:48,257 --> 00:33:52,710
TALIESIN: He is reaching under the table, ladies
and gentlemen.

550
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:55,262
LAURA: I know, what does this mean? Oh, okay.

551
00:33:55,262 --> 00:34:03,414
MATT: All right, is that your turn? You are now up
on the rooftop. There's rain pouring down. You

552
00:34:03,514 --> 00:34:07,130
are immediately soaked from the heavy storm that's
now coming into Whitestone.

553
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:11,710
SAM: Yeah. It's just me up here?

554
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,263
MATT: Just you up there, yeah.

555
00:34:13,263 --> 00:34:16,813
SAM: Okay. I will go invisible and just hang and
just see what happens.

556
00:34:16,813 --> 00:34:19,981
MATT: Okay. Easy enough to do, because it will
take a round for anyone to recover from that,

557
00:34:19,981 --> 00:34:22,908
anyway, because you have to use your action both
turns. So as you are waiting up there, you cast

558
00:34:22,908 --> 00:34:25,523
Invisibility on yourself and wait.

559
00:34:25,523 --> 00:34:31,913
SAM: And then I start digging through my pockets, 
if I have any flint or fire-making apparatus at all.

560
00:34:32,006 --> 00:34:33,543
MATT: Check your equipment.

561
00:34:33,543 --> 00:34:35,228
SAM: I will. I will look.

562
00:34:35,228 --> 00:34:36,552
MARISHA: Do you have an adventurer's kit?

563
00:34:36,552 --> 00:34:38,487
SAM: Nope. I have some poison.

564
00:34:38,487 --> 00:34:41,145
MATT: Poison the house. There you go. That'll
work.

565
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:47,342
TRAVIS: We are the best planners. Ever.

566
00:34:47,342 --> 00:34:48,937
MATT: I know, you guys are rocking it.

567
00:34:48,937 --> 00:34:50,042
SAM: Oh wait, I do have something.

568
00:34:50,042 --> 00:34:51,091
LAURA: Yeah? You do?!

569
00:34:51,091 --> 00:34:53,670
SAM: I have a Potion of Fire Breath.

570
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,182
MATT: You do.

571
00:34:55,182 --> 00:34:56,583
MARISHA: Okay!

572
00:34:56,583 --> 00:34:57,976
LAURA: It's raining up there.

573
00:34:57,976 --> 00:35:01,495
SAM: Well, but it's a potion. I don't know how it
works!

574
00:35:01,495 --> 00:35:05,567
MATT: You're checking your pockets. You find the
potion. You look down and you notice, even through

575
00:35:05,567 --> 00:35:13,737
the storm, you can see in the distance, there's
the dark shape of a giant lumbering zombie guard

576
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:17,062
making its way down to this part of the town. What
are you doing?

577
00:35:17,062 --> 00:35:21,278
SAM: So I'm on a roof that's all soaking wet,
right?

578
00:35:21,278 --> 00:35:22,122
MATT: Yeah.

579
00:35:22,122 --> 00:35:25,559
SAM: There's no crawl space access? No attic I can
get to?

580
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:27,079
MATT: Make a perception check.

581
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:33,977
SAM: Okay. Whoa, nothing. Two.

582
00:35:33,977 --> 00:35:39,515
MATT: Two? This is a pretty solid roof with
apparently no entry point at any points. The

583
00:35:39,515 --> 00:35:41,279
craftsmanship is flawless.

584
00:35:41,279 --> 00:35:51,955
SAM: Okay. You know what? I'll just try it. I will
Fire Breath Potion myself.

585
00:35:51,955 --> 00:35:55,275
MATT: Okay, you pull up (boink), pull the cork
off, (glug glug).

586
00:35:55,275 --> 00:35:57,526
SAM: I don't know what this thing does. I've just
got this.

587
00:35:57,526 --> 00:36:02,333
MATT: As you feel the fluid find its way down your
esophagus, it warms it like a fine whiskey would,

588
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:07,245
but the warmth just grows and grows to the point
where it's almost too hot, but it never quite

589
00:36:07,245 --> 00:36:11,666
reaches a point where it's painful, but you feel
as if this need to belch is burbling within your

590
00:36:11,666 --> 00:36:15,286
stomach, and at any given point in time, you could
let that belch fly forward.

591
00:36:15,286 --> 00:36:21,507
SAM: Okay. And am I close to the entry point roof?
The roof of the entry point?

592
00:36:21,507 --> 00:36:22,721
MATT: Where you came in?

593
00:36:22,721 --> 00:36:24,215
SAM: Can I get over there?

594
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:27,278
MATT: Yeah, you just come running across the
rooftop. It's a little bit of up and down as the

595
00:36:27,278 --> 00:36:32,007
topography happens, and as you're running, you
start hearing voices shouting out in the street.

596
00:36:32,007 --> 00:36:37,557
You make your way over to the top of the roof
above.

597
00:36:37,557 --> 00:36:45,798
SAM: Okay, so I'm just going to lean over the side
and scorch the whole front entrance as much as I

598
00:36:45,798 --> 00:36:47,551
can from where I am.

599
00:36:47,551 --> 00:36:54,431
MATT: Okay. As you (grunts) let the belch out, it
comes out in a large spray of orange, yellow, and

600
00:36:54,431 --> 00:36:59,225
red flames that immediately burst beneath the
overhang, which--

601
00:36:59,225 --> 00:37:01,495
SAM: By the way, I'm also invisible, right?

602
00:37:01,495 --> 00:37:05,782
MATT: You are no longer, unfortunately. When you
do an attack of some kind, the invisibility is

603
00:37:05,782 --> 00:37:13,556
released. So this gnome appears, soaking wet, over
the edge of the roof and then releases this gout of

604
00:37:13,587 --> 00:37:18,783
fire that blankets the front of the building,
catching flames on all the portions of the front

605
00:37:18,783 --> 00:37:23,174
part of the second, and parts of the first story,
including the top of the entryway that you had

606
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:27,410
already smashed through as a triceratops, which
exposed a lot of dried wood. It immediately bursts

607
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:33,825
into flame. As you complete that breath and you
inhale for a second, you hear voices now starting

608
00:37:33,825 --> 00:37:37,139
to shout from the inside of the house. (muffled
shouting) You can't really make out the noises,

609
00:37:37,139 --> 00:37:40,338
but it sounds like there's panic now starting to
hit from the inside, and you see a few guards

610
00:37:40,338 --> 00:37:46,699
start rushing out into the street to try and look
at where the source of the flames came from. They

611
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:48,219
both look up and see you.

612
00:37:48,219 --> 00:37:50,708
SAM: Oh, great! Wait, these are guards who are
outside, yeah?

613
00:37:50,708 --> 00:37:53,838
MATT: These are guards who were inside the house
that as soon as the fire came shooting down and

614
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:58,177
burned the house, they rush out, look up, grab
their crossbows, and aim them up towards you.

615
00:37:58,177 --> 00:37:59,989
TRAVIS: Just your hands and head are sticking
over.

616
00:37:59,989 --> 00:38:01,378
MATT: That's a 17?

617
00:38:01,378 --> 00:38:02,905
SAM: That hits.

618
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:04,182
MATT: And a 13.

619
00:38:04,182 --> 00:38:05,897
TALIESIN: Doesn't he have at least half-cover from
the roof?

620
00:38:06,002 --> 00:38:07,143
MATT: He does, actually.

621
00:38:07,143 --> 00:38:08,253
SAM: That does not hit.

622
00:38:08,253 --> 00:38:09,268
MATT: 17 does not hit.

623
00:38:09,268 --> 00:38:11,157
SAM: Oh, no, the 17 does-- well, it would have.

624
00:38:11,157 --> 00:38:15,570
MATT: That's a good point. You would have half-
cover from looking over the rooftop; you only have

625
00:38:15,712 --> 00:38:19,631
a little bit of your hands and your face showing.
So both go (pshew pshew), firing off into the

626
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:20,462
rainstorm.

627
00:38:20,462 --> 00:38:22,273
SAM: Because I'm a gnome, do I always have half-
cover?

628
00:38:22,273 --> 00:38:23,394
(laughter)

629
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:27,343
MATT: No. But it's easier for you to find it. It's
a lot less to cover.

630
00:38:27,343 --> 00:38:28,361
SAM: Okay.

631
00:38:28,361 --> 00:38:33,795
MATT: So both bolts (shoosh) streak past you into
the sky. They angrily reach down and duck back

632
00:38:33,795 --> 00:38:37,010
inside the building with the rest of their
movement to get out of the range of now what

633
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:42,979
appears to be a flame-throwing gnome. So that's
their go. What are you going to do?

634
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:48,481
SAM: Do I know enough about this potion to know if
it gives me any other breaths, or is that it?

635
00:38:48,481 --> 00:38:50,520
MATT: It does progressively give you a breath for
a short time.

636
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,722
SAM: So I can breathe again?

637
00:38:52,722 --> 00:38:55,399
MATT: Yeah. Specifically-- oh no!

638
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:57,405
(laughter)

639
00:38:57,405 --> 00:38:58,679
MATT: And that was the end of Scanlan.

640
00:38:58,679 --> 00:39:00,874
LIAM: It's the giant! It's the undead giant!

641
00:39:00,874 --> 00:39:05,356
SAM: I have no idea what I'm doing.

642
00:39:05,356 --> 00:39:08,166
TALIESIN: You're doing so well. It's so great.

643
00:39:08,166 --> 00:39:17,076
MATT: You have three different exhales of this.
It lasts for an hour or until you exhale three

644
00:39:17,109 --> 00:39:21,896
times. It's a bonus action to do it, so you could
also do something else and breathe fire.

645
00:39:21,896 --> 00:39:23,299
SAM: It's a bonus action?!

646
00:39:23,299 --> 00:39:24,249
MATT: Yep.

647
00:39:24,249 --> 00:39:25,900
SAM: Okay. Well, then.

648
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:29,532
TRAVIS: I don't know if that house is cooked
enough, man.

649
00:39:29,532 --> 00:39:31,616
LAURA: I know, maybe you should just keep burning
it.

650
00:39:31,616 --> 00:39:35,410
SAM: (laughs) Yeah. So I'll run over to the back
side of the house and do the same thing.

651
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:42,900
MATT: Okay. So you run over. Your full movement
will get you about halfway across. At a dash,

652
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:47,255
we'll get your other action there, and you'll have
your bonus action left over. You manage to slide

653
00:39:47,255 --> 00:39:54,605
across the roof, grab the edge, reach over and
(blows air). Just unleash on the opposite side.

654
00:39:54,605 --> 00:39:59,856
This side, because the angle the rain is coming
at, is getting a little bit of water, but there is

655
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:03,772
still a number of dry wood exposed by the
immediate overhang that it does manage to catch,

656
00:40:03,772 --> 00:40:07,448
and the flames are beginning to burn up and
collect on the sides because it is superheated

657
00:40:07,448 --> 00:40:12,184
flame. Both sides of the house now appear to be on
fire. Looking over your shoulder, you can see now

658
00:40:12,184 --> 00:40:17,894
there is a pillar of black smoke rising up from
the front of the building. You do see on the

659
00:40:17,894 --> 00:40:23,721
opposite side a hatch (click, bam) slam open and
you see a giant, meaty goliath hand (boof)--

660
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:25,263
LAURA: Oh no!

661
00:40:25,263 --> 00:40:32,458
MATT: Now stepping out into the rain, you see the
goliath Duke Vedmeyer step up (doosh) with his

662
00:40:32,458 --> 00:40:33,876
two-handed sword.

663
00:40:33,876 --> 00:40:37,757
SAM: Shit. (shouting) Lovely home you've got
here!

664
00:40:37,757 --> 00:40:52,619
TRAVIS: It's like Duel of the Fates. On a burning
rooftop in the rain. (laughing) Giant goliath and

665
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:55,455
a gnome who spits fire.

666
00:40:55,455 --> 00:40:59,969
MATT: All right, it's your turn.

667
00:40:59,969 --> 00:41:05,303
SAM: Okay. How close is his hatch to the edge?

668
00:41:05,303 --> 00:41:10,957
MATT: The hatch is actually halfway. It's in the
middle of the roof. It's actually met from the

669
00:41:10,957 --> 00:41:16,228
second story, from one of the rooms or one of the
closets, so it's about 25 feet from either the

670
00:41:16,228 --> 00:41:19,522
front or the back side. It's right in the center
of the house.

671
00:41:19,522 --> 00:41:22,652
SAM: (frantic breathing) Okay.

672
00:41:22,652 --> 00:41:24,275
MATT: Whatcha got, Scanlan? Whatcha got?

673
00:41:24,275 --> 00:41:27,648
SAM: (muffled) I'm trying. I'm just seeing range
here.

674
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:34,003
MARISHA: It looks like a Frank Miller comic right
now. It's what I see in my head.

675
00:41:34,003 --> 00:41:35,737
MATT: Scanlan showing down in the rain.

676
00:41:35,737 --> 00:41:40,497
SAM: Five times your Spellcasting ability
modifier. My Spellcasting ability modifier is--

677
00:41:40,497 --> 00:41:41,586
what?

678
00:41:41,586 --> 00:41:43,221
MATT: It's charisma.

679
00:41:43,257 --> 00:41:49,874
SAM: It's charisma. It's five. Five times five,
that's 25. That's 25 feet. Okay. (sings) Bigby's

680
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:58,641
Hand! So I call forth Bigby's Hand and
I will force him off the roof.

681
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,923
(cheering)

682
00:42:00,923 --> 00:42:04,899
MATT: Okay. All right.

683
00:42:04,899 --> 00:42:07,375
TALIESIN: The roof is wet.

684
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:11,472
MATT: The roof is indeed wet. I'm aware. (laughs)
Oh, this will be interesting.

685
00:42:11,472 --> 00:42:13,933
SAM: (sings) I want to fly away.

686
00:42:13,933 --> 00:42:18,790
TALIESIN, MARISHA, AND SAM: (sing) Yeah, yeah,
yeah.

687
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:23,548
MATT: Okay. So you create the hand next to him,
and as he starts stepping forward towards you with

688
00:42:23,548 --> 00:42:28,285
his sword at the ready, there's a shimmer in the
air as a giant kind of vaguely purplish arcane

689
00:42:28,285 --> 00:42:33,276
hand all of a sudden appears. He looks confused
for a second and rears back to try and attack it.

690
00:42:33,276 --> 00:42:38,675
As the hand pulls back, comes rushing
forward towards him, I want you to go ahead and

691
00:42:38,675 --> 00:42:41,289
make a strength check with the hand.

692
00:42:41,289 --> 00:42:42,805
SAM: Oh shit, he's strong.

693
00:42:42,805 --> 00:42:45,550
MATT: The strength is plus eight, so add eight to
this roll.

694
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:49,064
SAM: 17 plus eight...

695
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:50,790
MATT: (laughs) Natural one.

696
00:42:50,904 --> 00:42:56,426
(cheering)

697
00:42:56,495 --> 00:42:58,612
SAM: I'm going to kill everyone in this
motherfucking house!

698
00:42:58,755 --> 00:43:00,762
(laughter)

699
00:43:00,762 --> 00:43:02,957
MATT: I've rolled so many ones today. This is
ridiculous.

700
00:43:02,957 --> 00:43:05,005
MARISHA: You have, and we're just getting
started.

701
00:43:05,005 --> 00:43:08,633
MATT: All right. The hand pushes him five feet
plus the number of feet equal to five times your

702
00:43:08,633 --> 00:43:16,463
spellcasting modifier. Yeah. Okay. As the hand
shoves him, he goes pushed off to this side. Seems

703
00:43:16,463 --> 00:43:19,853
to be holding against it, but the hand eventually
scoops him up and actually gets him off of his

704
00:43:19,853 --> 00:43:27,190
feet and shot-puts him off the roof. He plummets
backward off the side of the roof, and

705
00:43:27,295 --> 00:43:41,564
you wait a second to hear a (boof) across the way.
That's full damage there. (mutters) Okay, he

706
00:43:41,564 --> 00:43:46,335
takes 34 points of falling damage and is knocked
prone.

707
00:43:46,335 --> 00:43:49,609
LIAM: You can't get this on network television,
ladies and gentlemen.

708
00:43:49,609 --> 00:43:53,689
MATT: So you're now standing alone on the rooftop,
your Bigby Hand there next to you, a little

709
00:43:53,689 --> 00:43:58,114
trickle of fire curling at the corner of your
mouth from your final dragon's breath when you

710
00:43:58,114 --> 00:44:01,419
decide to use it. What are you going to do?

711
00:44:01,419 --> 00:44:04,778
SAM: Oh. I've got to get out of here. (laughs)

712
00:44:04,778 --> 00:44:06,270
TRAVIS: Just burn it.

713
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:08,256
LAURA: Burn in the hatch and then get out.

714
00:44:08,256 --> 00:44:10,987
SAM: Okay. Am I close to the hatch?

715
00:44:10,987 --> 00:44:13,265
MATT: Yeah, you're about 25 feet from it. It's
where you got him.

716
00:44:13,265 --> 00:44:22,510
SAM: I'll hoof it over there and just look around
and punch myself in the gut, (belch).

717
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:27,089
MATT: Okay. As you reach over, you look down, and
there is a ladder that leads up to the front, and

718
00:44:27,089 --> 00:44:30,647
there are two guards that are currently making
their way up to the roof. They look up and see

719
00:44:30,647 --> 00:44:34,817
you, and their eyes go wide within their helmets,
and as you release the flames, all you see is

720
00:44:34,817 --> 00:44:41,675
their faces go, "Ah!" Just engulfing the
entire tunnel. Roll 4d6.

721
00:44:41,675 --> 00:44:43,723
MARISHA and SAM: 4d6?

722
00:44:43,723 --> 00:44:44,624
MATT: Yes.

723
00:44:44,624 --> 00:44:46,009
SAM: I don't have any d6.

724
00:44:46,009 --> 00:44:51,116
MATT: There you go. They both fail their DC 13
dexterity saving throws because I can't roll

725
00:44:51,116 --> 00:44:52,288
tonight.

726
00:44:52,288 --> 00:44:53,461
SAM: 15.

727
00:44:53,461 --> 00:44:59,498
MATT: 15? Okay. They both take 15 points of fire
damage and the entirety of that space has now

728
00:44:59,498 --> 00:45:04,338
burst into flames. You pull back because the heat
is intense, backdraft-style, as you're at the top.

729
00:45:04,338 --> 00:45:05,858
SAM: Do my eyebrows burn off?

730
00:45:05,858 --> 00:45:08,392
MATT: They don't burn off, but you feel they might
be a little singed. You'd have to give it a few days

731
00:45:08,392 --> 00:45:13,330
to recover. And you hear screaming down inside the
tunnel and both of them are currently dealing with

732
00:45:13,439 --> 00:45:18,300
the fact that they're on fire. So that's your
movement, that's your bonus action. You still have

733
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:19,581
an action.

734
00:45:19,581 --> 00:45:25,395
SAM: Okay. I've got to get the hell out of here,
guys. Okay, tell me this, Dungeon Master.

735
00:45:25,395 --> 00:45:26,471
MATT: Yes?

736
00:45:26,471 --> 00:45:30,021
SAM: Dimension Door. Can it be used at higher
levels?

737
00:45:30,021 --> 00:45:34,305
MATT: Let me double-check on that, actually. I
don't know if it can, but we'll find out.

738
00:45:34,305 --> 00:45:38,113
LAURA: Can you Bigby's-Hand slam down onto the
Count?

739
00:45:38,113 --> 00:45:40,583
MATT: Dimension Door, no. Dimension Door cannot.

740
00:45:40,685 --> 00:45:43,167
SAM: Okay. How about Polymorph?

741
00:45:43,167 --> 00:45:45,767
MATT: Polymorph... nope.

742
00:45:45,767 --> 00:45:48,937
SAM: I'm fucked. (laughs)

743
00:45:48,937 --> 00:45:50,929
LAURA: You've used all your spell slots?

744
00:45:50,929 --> 00:45:54,193
TALIESIN: You can use Bigby's Hand to--

745
00:45:54,193 --> 00:45:58,978
SAM: I don't know if Bigby's Hand can catch me.
It's not like Feather Fall.

746
00:45:58,978 --> 00:46:00,200
MARISHA: Can it carry you?

747
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,291
LAURA: Can you float?

748
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:03,349
TRAVIS: Maybe it's like a slide.

749
00:46:03,349 --> 00:46:05,643
LAURA: Maybe you can slide down Bigby's Hand.

750
00:46:05,643 --> 00:46:07,261
TALIESIN: Fly it like the carpet.

751
00:46:07,261 --> 00:46:09,000
MATT: Do you want to try?

752
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,754
TRAVIS: You're welcome to try.

753
00:46:10,754 --> 00:46:13,718
LIAM: Yeah, you've lifted people with it. You've
grabbed people.

754
00:46:13,718 --> 00:46:16,155
TRAVIS: I mean, ultimately, on foot sucks for him
right now.

755
00:46:16,155 --> 00:46:18,888
MARISHA: Just surf on the giant floating hand.

756
00:46:18,888 --> 00:46:20,118
TALIESIN: Through the sky.

757
00:46:20,118 --> 00:46:21,713
MARISHA: Through the sky.

758
00:46:21,713 --> 00:46:24,015
LIAM: Is what your friends would say if they were
there.

759
00:46:24,015 --> 00:46:24,874
MARISHA: Yeah.

760
00:46:24,874 --> 00:46:27,285
TRAVIS: All you've got to do is get away for this
to be amazing.

761
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:31,486
LAURA: Otherwise, you'll burn alive on a roof.

762
00:46:31,597 --> 00:46:33,251
MARISHA: All you have to do is live.

763
00:46:33,251 --> 00:46:34,738
LIAM: Comically tragic.

764
00:46:34,738 --> 00:46:35,980
MATT: What are you doing?

765
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:38,628
SAM: Okay. Does Unseen Servant have any mass?

766
00:46:38,628 --> 00:46:44,736
MATT: Not really, no. Unseen Servant is like a
barely-there small-level air elemental.

767
00:46:44,736 --> 00:47:00,973
SAM: Okay. So I'm just going to (hums a bit, then
sings) I'm jumping in the rain. I'm jump--

768
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:05,649
so I'm going to jump off the-- can I go away from
the Goliath?

769
00:47:05,649 --> 00:47:08,622
MATT: That would be this way, this way, or this
way, because he fell off that side.

770
00:47:08,622 --> 00:47:10,719
SAM: So not the two sides that are on fire.

771
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:15,048
MATT: The flames are now licking up both sides of
the house, so you have to go this way.

772
00:47:15,048 --> 00:47:17,126
TRAVIS: Where's the zombie stone giant now?

773
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:19,918
SAM: It's going to take a couple of turns to get
over there.

774
00:47:19,918 --> 00:47:23,963
MATT: Yeah, the full length of it. At full dash it will
get you there and there, and you still have about

775
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:26,426
a good 20 more feet to get, so that's your turn,
there.

776
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:27,656
SAM: Okay.

777
00:47:27,656 --> 00:47:35,948
MATT: The two guards that were back that way are
now no longer on fire. They have gotten to the

778
00:47:35,948 --> 00:47:40,307
roof and put themselves out. They both look very,
very angry at the current circumstance. They step

779
00:47:40,307 --> 00:47:42,151
out of the hatch both places.

780
00:47:42,151 --> 00:47:43,629
LIAM: Different hatch or the same hatch?

781
00:47:43,629 --> 00:47:44,994
TRAVIS: The hatch is on fire?

782
00:47:44,994 --> 00:47:48,669
MATT: The hatch is still on fire, there are still
flames, but they got out (panting). They're out in

783
00:47:48,669 --> 00:47:51,711
the rain now. The rain's putting out and dousing
the flame that's on them. They both look over and

784
00:47:51,711 --> 00:47:56,985
see you running away. They pull their hand
crossbows at the ready. They were already ready to

785
00:47:57,027 --> 00:48:02,696
fire. That's a 24? And a 26.

786
00:48:02,696 --> 00:48:07,701
SAM: For the second guy, I-- no, I'll just take
it. Okay.

787
00:48:07,701 --> 00:48:14,617
MATT: Okay, they both hit. They had 24 and 26.
That is seven points of piercing damage and 12

788
00:48:14,617 --> 00:48:17,975
points of piercing damage. So 19 total.

789
00:48:17,975 --> 00:48:19,572
SAM: Okay, got it.

790
00:48:19,572 --> 00:48:22,847
MATT: All righty. They both reach over and grab
bolts out of their sides and start preparing for

791
00:48:22,847 --> 00:48:27,551
another series of shots. Both catch you in the
side. One you can feel a few inches into your

792
00:48:27,551 --> 00:48:32,280
shoulder and it's making the joint stick, and the
pain is starting to really burn on the left side

793
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:35,465
of your body, but you're okay. Now it's your
turn.

794
00:48:35,465 --> 00:48:41,253
SAM: Okay. I look back at them and I do that thing
where you just kind of do this.

795
00:48:41,253 --> 00:48:42,623
(laughter)

796
00:48:42,623 --> 00:48:43,755
MARISHA: Trust fall?

797
00:48:43,755 --> 00:48:45,336
SAM: And I trust fall off the back of it.

798
00:48:45,336 --> 00:48:46,618
LIAM: Do you have the earring in?

799
00:48:46,618 --> 00:48:52,324
SAM: Oh, I do. (laughs) But I'm going to
simultaneously make Bigby's Hand try to catch me

800
00:48:52,324 --> 00:48:53,949
at the bottom of it.

801
00:48:53,949 --> 00:48:59,286
MATT: Go ahead and roll a d20 and add your
charisma modifier to it.

802
00:48:59,286 --> 00:49:00,288
SAM: Charisma?

803
00:49:00,288 --> 00:49:01,622
MATT: Yeah.

804
00:49:01,622 --> 00:49:03,947
SAM: That's 20.

805
00:49:03,990 --> 00:49:09,331
MATT: 20? You trust-fall off, your eyes somewhat
closed and letting it happen.

806
00:49:09,331 --> 00:49:11,015
SAM: Come on, Bigby. Catch me.

807
00:49:11,015 --> 00:49:15,679
MATT: And in the moment that you expect ground to
meet you with a heavy, hard smack of reality, a

808
00:49:15,679 --> 00:49:22,594
soft cushion of arcane energy catches you as these
spiritual purplish fingers curl around and gently

809
00:49:22,594 --> 00:49:24,088
bring you to the ground.

810
00:49:24,088 --> 00:49:25,207
TRAVIS: Beymaxed it.

811
00:49:25,207 --> 00:49:26,591
SAM: Oh! Don't get handsy, Bigby.

812
00:49:26,591 --> 00:49:28,113
(laughter)

813
00:49:28,113 --> 00:49:29,455
LAURA: Austin Powers.

814
00:49:29,455 --> 00:49:33,748
SAM: All right. Is that my turn?

815
00:49:33,748 --> 00:49:38,703
MATT: Oh, that was just the fall, and you land
there. He's way over this way. So you're outside

816
00:49:38,703 --> 00:49:43,315
of the house now. You're in a small alley
between-- well, not an alley. You're on the side

817
00:49:43,315 --> 00:49:47,614
of the house and there's a big grassy area around
it, and there's the fence that surrounds the

818
00:49:47,614 --> 00:49:48,655
whole...

819
00:49:48,655 --> 00:49:49,898
LIAM: Run, Forrest.

820
00:49:49,898 --> 00:49:54,655
SAM: So I'm going to-- do I get an action? No,
Bigby's is a bonus action.

821
00:49:54,655 --> 00:50:01,015
MATT: It's an action to use its ability, so it was
your action to catch you as part of it.

822
00:50:01,015 --> 00:50:02,295
SAM: It's an action?

823
00:50:02,295 --> 00:50:04,492
MATT: To do anything with Bigby's Hand.

824
00:50:04,492 --> 00:50:10,639
SAM: It says, "and as a bonus action on subsequent
turns."

825
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:12,322
MATT: Oh, it's a bonus action?

826
00:50:12,322 --> 00:50:17,184
SAM: Oh, wait. No, that's for moving it. The bonus
action is moving it. I got it.

827
00:50:17,184 --> 00:50:18,295
MATT: Yeah.

828
00:50:18,295 --> 00:50:19,279
SAM: Okay.

829
00:50:19,279 --> 00:50:20,943
MATT: So you've been moving it along with you as
you go.

830
00:50:20,943 --> 00:50:22,537
SAM: Yeah, but the act of catching me was the
action.

831
00:50:22,537 --> 00:50:23,395
MATT: Yeah.

832
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:25,516
SAM: Got it. Okay. So I'll just start running.
(laughs)

833
00:50:25,516 --> 00:50:27,048
MATT: Okay. So you're going to start running over
this way.

834
00:50:27,048 --> 00:50:29,484
SAM: On my tiny little nubby legs.

835
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:39,776
MATT: All right. As you run, you get over to the
front of the gate that is closed off. It's a

836
00:50:39,776 --> 00:50:43,987
little bit too tight for you to squeeze through.
How do you plan to get over the gate?

837
00:50:43,987 --> 00:50:46,186
SAM: I'm planning to climb over the gate.

838
00:50:46,186 --> 00:50:47,094
MATT: Okay.

839
00:50:47,094 --> 00:50:48,958
SAM: (laughs) I've got nothing left.

840
00:50:48,958 --> 00:50:51,926
MATT: Make an athletics or acrobatics check to try
and get over the gate.

841
00:50:51,926 --> 00:50:54,870
LIAM: Whatever the better number is. Whatever's
better: athletics or acrobatics.

842
00:50:54,870 --> 00:50:57,517
SAM: They're both pretty terrible. 16.

843
00:50:57,517 --> 00:51:00,041
MATT: 16. Okay. Is that acrobatics or athletics?

844
00:51:00,041 --> 00:51:01,737
SAM: That's athletics.

845
00:51:01,737 --> 00:51:05,878
MATT: Athletics. So you run, you jump up (ching),
grab onto the metal bars to start just pulling

846
00:51:05,878 --> 00:51:11,650
yourself up over the top, land on your feet, and
you're now right near where the street is, and you

847
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:16,743
can see to your right it's open, towards the
direction of where the rest of the party is. To

848
00:51:16,743 --> 00:51:21,040
the left, you can see now, coming through the rain
about a hundred feet from you, a giant hulking

849
00:51:21,081 --> 00:51:27,285
zombie giant that's stomping towards you. As you
notice that, you see a number of figures come

850
00:51:27,285 --> 00:51:32,271
swarming out of the two buildings to the side of
it, and immediately start attacking the zombie giant.

851
00:51:32,271 --> 00:51:36,447
TRAVIS AND LIAM: Go, go, get out.

852
00:51:36,447 --> 00:51:38,235
MARISHA: They're attacking the--

853
00:51:38,235 --> 00:51:40,150
LAURA: They're attacking the zombie giant. That's
good.

854
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:42,269
LIAM: You have inspired people. G-T-F-O, man.

855
00:51:42,269 --> 00:51:50,142
SAM: Yeah. I'm useless to you guys. Yeah, I'm
going to go invisible and watch from the shadows.

856
00:51:50,142 --> 00:51:55,764
MATT: Okay. So you just cloak yourself and watch
from the shadows off to the side. As you are there

857
00:51:55,764 --> 00:51:59,108
for a little bit, keeping your eye out for the
next couple of minutes, you can see the house is

858
00:51:59,108 --> 00:52:04,889
now completely engulfed in flames. The rain, try
as it might-- the roof itself is not catching yet,

859
00:52:04,889 --> 00:52:09,199
but you can see now, fire is licking out of every
single window and glass is steadily breaking over

860
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:13,838
time. (crash, crash) The guards have all escaped
out, and you can see the guards and Vedmeyer are

861
00:52:13,838 --> 00:52:18,010
now storming across the entire grounds. He's
giving orders left and right, and they're all out

862
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:20,950
searching for you in the nearby vicinity of the
home.

863
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:25,764
Looking across the way, you can see the zombie
giant is now currently reaching down and swapping

864
00:52:25,764 --> 00:52:31,384
down. You can get a closer view. They look like
some of the normal inhabitants here, are wearing

865
00:52:31,384 --> 00:52:38,790
makeshift armor, weapons that they have, and they
are now rising up and attempting to take down this

866
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:42,918
zombie giant. You watch as it reaches out. It
slams and smashes one to the ground, leaving him

867
00:52:42,918 --> 00:52:46,649
lifeless, while another two leap up on the back of
the zombie giant and are stabbing it with spears,

868
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:52,181
and you see it (moaning), it gives out this roar.
It's hard to tell from this distance which side is

869
00:52:52,181 --> 00:52:57,389
getting any ground, but it is currently held up by
this group of about ten individuals that are

870
00:52:57,389 --> 00:52:58,626
attacking it at once.

871
00:52:58,626 --> 00:52:59,475
SAM: It's cool.

872
00:52:59,475 --> 00:53:00,507
MARISHA: That's so cool.

873
00:53:00,507 --> 00:53:01,843
MATT: You just going to stay there and wait it
out?

874
00:53:01,843 --> 00:53:05,912
SAM: I think I'll wait it out if I'm in a
relatively safe place, because I can't really do

875
00:53:05,912 --> 00:53:08,510
anything for you guys, anyway. You're on your
own.

876
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:12,000
MATT: Okay. We'll use that to hop over to the
other party.

877
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,921
SAM: Oh, I'm taking a short rest.

878
00:53:14,921 --> 00:53:16,390
LAURA: Oh, that's good! Yes.

879
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:19,099
MATT: A short rest is about half an hour to 40
minutes of waiting, so you might want to find a

880
00:53:19,099 --> 00:53:23,784
place that isn't quite so intense to do this. You
can try and sneak into one of the nearby homes and

881
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:24,828
do it, maybe.

882
00:53:24,828 --> 00:53:27,269
SAM: Well, I still want to see where this giant
thing goes, so I'm still watching it.

883
00:53:27,269 --> 00:53:30,627
MATT: Okay, so you would not be able to rest,
unfortunately. It's not a very restful situation

884
00:53:30,627 --> 00:53:33,058
right now, to gather yourself. Okay.

885
00:53:33,058 --> 00:53:34,870
SAM: Whew! I lived.

886
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:38,038
LAURA: I like that Scanlan takes out an entire
house, and we're all probably going to die.

887
00:53:38,038 --> 00:53:41,308
TRAVIS: Dude, you were fucking Rambo just then.
You were Scanlan Rambo.

888
00:53:41,308 --> 00:53:42,752
LAURA: You're a legend.

889
00:53:42,752 --> 00:53:46,251
TRAVIS: Do you have any red cloth you can tear off
and tie around your forehead?

890
00:53:46,251 --> 00:53:48,769
LIAM: Is your beret still on?

891
00:53:48,769 --> 00:53:51,712
SAM: (laughs) I never got a beret. Did I get a
beret?

892
00:53:51,712 --> 00:53:53,167
TALIESIN: You did get a beret. I thought you got a
beret.

893
00:53:53,167 --> 00:53:54,418
SAM: Yeah, I wanted a beret.

894
00:53:54,418 --> 00:53:55,673
TRAVIS: That was outstanding.

895
00:53:55,673 --> 00:53:58,952
(laughter)

896
00:53:58,952 --> 00:54:08,727
MATT: I approve of this greatly. All righty. The
rest of you guys who have all been slinking out

897
00:54:08,727 --> 00:54:12,830
the back. You just knocked a guard out. Trinket
came with you?

898
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:14,851
LAURA: Trinket went with Grog.

899
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:16,635
MATT: Grog. Right, that's right!

900
00:54:16,635 --> 00:54:21,106
LAURA: You can do it, buddy!

901
00:54:21,106 --> 00:54:28,644
MATT: Percy, Vex, you guys are all back this way.
The back of the building. You can see what looks

902
00:54:28,644 --> 00:54:35,985
to be one door to a back room. Grog, as you come
slamming up with Trinket behind you (thudding

903
00:54:35,985 --> 00:54:39,802
footsteps) up to the front of the building, you
see the front doors are there before you.

904
00:54:39,802 --> 00:54:41,510
TRAVIS: Oh, they're in front of us?

905
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:42,353
MATT: Yeah.

906
00:54:42,353 --> 00:54:43,389
TRAVIS: I'm already raging?

907
00:54:43,389 --> 00:54:44,084
MATT: Yeah.

908
00:54:44,084 --> 00:54:45,542
TRAVIS: I just fucking bust through,
apeshit-style.

909
00:54:45,542 --> 00:54:46,921
MATT: Okay. Make a strength check.

910
00:54:46,921 --> 00:54:47,710
TRAVIS: Okay.

911
00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:48,871
LAURA: Can I ask you, really fast?

912
00:54:48,871 --> 00:54:49,677
MATT: Yes.

913
00:54:49,677 --> 00:54:51,366
LAURA: I never leveled up Trinket's hit points
when I leveled up.

914
00:54:51,366 --> 00:54:53,969
MATT: You didn't. All right.

915
00:54:53,969 --> 00:54:56,057
LAURA: That's important at this moment.

916
00:54:56,057 --> 00:54:58,689
MATT: It is very important at this moment.

917
00:54:58,689 --> 00:55:00,882
TALIESIN: Ugh, why do you have to do that, man?

918
00:55:00,882 --> 00:55:02,389
MATT: Trinket's hit points right now are what?

919
00:55:02,389 --> 00:55:03,600
LAURA: 56.

920
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,733
MATT: 56.

921
00:55:04,733 --> 00:55:13,007
MARISHA: This Elder Scrolls music is pretty dope.

922
00:55:13,007 --> 00:55:14,672
LIAM: Bringing it home.

923
00:55:14,672 --> 00:55:16,466
MATT: Trinket should have four more hit points.

924
00:55:16,466 --> 00:55:17,259
LAURA: Four?

925
00:55:17,259 --> 00:55:20,527
MATT: Yeah. All righty.

926
00:55:20,527 --> 00:55:22,352
LIAM: Zac, adjusting the microphones.

927
00:55:22,352 --> 00:55:24,313
ZAC: Nobody knows. Nobody knew, until you said
something!

928
00:55:24,313 --> 00:55:27,690
TRAVIS: I got advantage on the strength check, so
it was a 26.

929
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:29,068
MATT: 26?

930
00:55:29,068 --> 00:55:30,050
TRAVIS: Yes.

931
00:55:30,050 --> 00:55:34,427
MATT: You rush forward. With your foot, (boom)
it's Sparta, the front of that door as it just

932
00:55:34,427 --> 00:55:39,224
(crash) cracks open, Trinket coming up behind you.
The doors open. You can see now before you, there

933
00:55:39,224 --> 00:55:45,274
is a single staircase that curves up to a second
floor. There is a large vase right at the base of

934
00:55:45,274 --> 00:55:48,939
it, right there. There's a couple of tables by it,
and it goes to the right and left. Do you enter

935
00:55:49,027 --> 00:55:52,425
the premises, or are you staying right at the
door? It's up to you.

936
00:55:52,425 --> 00:55:54,263
TRAVIS: Yeah, I go in.

937
00:55:54,263 --> 00:55:58,358
MATT: All right. Grog, you push your way in,
Trinket following behind you right there.

938
00:55:58,358 --> 00:56:06,407
Immediately, you see the upper banister, right
over the railing also, similar to what Scanlan

939
00:56:06,407 --> 00:56:24,399
encountered, has guards completely within this
area, at the ready, crossbows pulled. In wait.

940
00:56:24,399 --> 00:56:30,837
LAURA: Oh, god. He just keeps adding them!

941
00:56:30,837 --> 00:56:35,494
LIAM: Just 12 more.

942
00:56:35,494 --> 00:56:39,944
MARISHA: Cool.

943
00:56:39,944 --> 00:56:47,287
MATT: There is Tylieri. All waiting, crossbows at
the ready. The doors slam open, you guys rush in.

944
00:56:47,287 --> 00:56:51,549
For a second, there's nothing immediately within
your range, and you look up and see an entire

945
00:56:51,549 --> 00:56:58,551
array of guards all trained upon you and Trinket.
A voice behind them goes, "Loose!" (fshh)

946
00:56:58,609 --> 00:57:01,217
TRAVIS: At least Trinket's behind me.

947
00:57:01,310 --> 00:57:04,492
MATT: (chuckles) What's your armor class?

948
00:57:04,593 --> 00:57:07,104
TRAVIS: 19.

949
00:57:07,104 --> 00:57:11,557
LIAM: You're going to tell us when we can do
something in the back, right?

950
00:57:11,557 --> 00:57:16,054
MATT: Yep. This is just-- because of the speed
everything goes, he gets there before anybody.

951
00:57:16,054 --> 00:57:17,957
LIAM: Yeah. Just curious.

952
00:57:17,957 --> 00:57:23,467
MATT: No worries. All right, that is-- ooh. That
is 27 to hit?

953
00:57:23,467 --> 00:57:24,799
TRAVIS: Yep.

954
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:34,109
MATT: That is 15 to hit? No. Third one, that is 16
to hit? Nope. That is a 21 to hit?

955
00:57:34,109 --> 00:57:35,542
TRAVIS: Yep.

956
00:57:35,542 --> 00:57:38,258
MATT: 26 to hit.

957
00:57:38,258 --> 00:57:39,348
TRAVIS: Yes.

958
00:57:39,348 --> 00:57:41,801
MATT: That's a 22 to hit?

959
00:57:41,801 --> 00:57:42,763
TRAVIS: Yep.

960
00:57:42,763 --> 00:57:46,120
LAURA: All the shitty guards were over at the
other house.

961
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:47,468
MATT: 14 to hit?

962
00:57:47,468 --> 00:57:48,570
TRAVIS: No.

963
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:49,937
MATT: 20 to hit?

964
00:57:49,937 --> 00:57:51,111
TRAVIS: Yep.

965
00:57:51,111 --> 00:57:52,422
MATT: Then three more.

966
00:57:52,422 --> 00:57:54,141
TRAVIS: Yeah.

967
00:57:54,141 --> 00:57:56,769
MATT: 22 to hit?

968
00:57:56,769 --> 00:57:58,805
TRAVIS: Yep, that hits.

969
00:57:58,805 --> 00:58:00,344
MATT: 12 to hit?

970
00:58:00,344 --> 00:58:01,841
TRAVIS: No. Last one?

971
00:58:01,841 --> 00:58:03,615
MATT: And ten to hit. Yeah.

972
00:58:03,615 --> 00:58:04,626
MATT AND TRAVIS: Six.

973
00:58:04,626 --> 00:58:10,835
MATT: Six crossbow bolts come at you. That's eight
points of piercing damage. Don't halve them yet.

974
00:58:10,835 --> 00:58:12,648
We'll add them all up and then we'll halve that.

975
00:58:12,648 --> 00:58:13,680
TRAVIS: Okay.

976
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:24,731
MATT: So, eight plus 13. 21. Plus eight again, 29.
Plus another nine.

977
00:58:24,731 --> 00:58:26,127
TRAVIS: 38.

978
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:29,066
MATT: 38, plus another 11.

979
00:58:29,066 --> 00:58:30,609
TRAVIS: 49.

980
00:58:30,609 --> 00:58:34,878
MATT: So 49, and then another 12.

981
00:58:34,878 --> 00:58:38,411
LAURA: 61.

982
00:58:38,411 --> 00:58:43,252
MATT: So 61. So you take half that, which would be
31 points of piercing damage on you in one volley

983
00:58:43,252 --> 00:58:52,841
of crossbow bolts at you. (shoosh) You protected
Trinket, and the rage did descend it a little bit. The

984
00:58:52,841 --> 00:58:56,806
pain, as all these bolts are now sticking out of
your chest. You look like this front-quilled

985
00:58:56,839 --> 00:59:01,141
porcupine. You just take the pain and grin for a
second. You have that iron-y taste of blood reach

986
00:59:01,141 --> 00:59:06,931
the back of your throat from the immediate impact
and it just further intensifies your rage. I'm

987
00:59:06,981 --> 00:59:09,686
going to have everyone here roll initiative
because you're all acting simultaneously

988
00:59:09,686 --> 00:59:10,988
at this point.

989
00:59:10,988 --> 00:59:12,358
MARISHA: Which dice? Green dice.

990
00:59:12,358 --> 00:59:13,769
LAURA: I know, I'm like, "Which ones?"

991
00:59:13,769 --> 00:59:16,620
MARISHA: That was-- nope. Not good.

992
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:24,496
MATT: All righty. 25 to 20?

993
00:59:24,496 --> 00:59:27,858
LAURA: Oh, should I roll for Trinket, too? Oh, he
goes when I go.

994
00:59:27,858 --> 00:59:29,162
MATT: Trinket goes when you go.

995
00:59:29,162 --> 00:59:30,343
LIAM: 23.

996
00:59:30,343 --> 00:59:39,523
MATT: 23? All right. We have Vax at the top. 20 to
15?

997
00:59:39,523 --> 00:59:40,811
TRAVIS: 18.

998
00:59:40,811 --> 00:59:41,886
LAURA: 17.

999
00:59:41,886 --> 00:59:43,628
MATT: All right.

1000
00:59:43,628 --> 00:59:48,191
TRAVIS: Thanks to the Feral Instinct.

1001
00:59:48,216 --> 00:59:53,960
MATT: All right. 15 to ten? Ten to five?

1002
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,290
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

1003
00:59:55,290 --> 00:59:56,449
MARISHA: Five.

1004
00:59:56,449 --> 00:59:57,442
MATT: What did you get?

1005
00:59:57,442 --> 00:59:58,396
SAM: I'm not there.

1006
00:59:58,396 --> 00:59:59,486
MATT: Oh, no. Sorry, you're not.

1007
00:59:59,486 --> 01:00:02,528
TALIESIN: I totally forgot. I'm so sorry. I'm at
26. I got distracted because I have a new--

1008
01:00:02,528 --> 01:00:03,727
TRAVIS: Distracted by what?

1009
01:00:03,727 --> 01:00:07,685
MATT: To be fair, I asked 25 to 20. (laughs)
That's my own fault.

1010
01:00:07,735 --> 01:00:12,670
TALIESIN: I'm using my new sheet and I'm just
confused, so yeah.

1011
01:00:12,670 --> 01:00:13,796
MATT: That's okay.

1012
01:00:13,796 --> 01:00:15,172
LAURA: You're cheating?!

1013
01:00:15,172 --> 01:00:17,882
TALIESIN: New sheet. I leveled up, so I had to do
a thing.

1014
01:00:17,882 --> 01:00:21,370
MATT: By the way, guys, both Scanlan and Percy
leveled up this last time.

1015
01:00:21,370 --> 01:00:23,762
TRAVIS: If only Rambo Scanlan was here.

1016
01:00:23,762 --> 01:00:25,485
(laughter)

1017
01:00:25,485 --> 01:00:27,167
LAURA: It's insane.

1018
01:00:27,167 --> 01:00:32,607
MATT: So. We have at the top of this combat round,
Percy.

1019
01:00:32,607 --> 01:00:36,150
TALIESIN: Oh boy. Okay, is there a way in?

1020
01:00:36,150 --> 01:00:38,702
SAM: Are you getting a FaceTime?

1021
01:00:38,702 --> 01:00:40,235
MATT: Am I?

1022
01:00:40,235 --> 01:00:41,844
TALIESIN: Are you FaceTiming somebody?

1023
01:00:41,844 --> 01:00:48,527
MATT: I'd better not be. That was weird. I don't
know what happened there. Anyway. Battle's still up.

1024
01:00:48,527 --> 01:00:51,422
TALIESIN: So is there a way in, at this point?

1025
01:00:51,422 --> 01:00:56,984
MATT: There is a door right here at the back of
the building that you can see, but the door is

1026
01:00:56,984 --> 01:00:58,305
currently closed.

1027
01:00:58,305 --> 01:01:01,385
TALIESIN: I'm running over to the door and opening
it. I can hear the commotion from inside, and I'm

1028
01:01:01,385 --> 01:01:02,342
running in the door.

1029
01:01:02,342 --> 01:01:04,687
MATT: Okay. You rush to the door. You go to try
it, (clicking). The door is locked.

1030
01:01:04,687 --> 01:01:07,128
LIAM: Hold your turn, dude.

1031
01:01:07,128 --> 01:01:08,903
TALIESIN: I'm holding my turn.

1032
01:01:08,903 --> 01:01:10,643
MATT: You're going to hold your action.

1033
01:01:10,643 --> 01:01:11,807
TALIESIN: I'm holding my action.

1034
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:12,882
MATT: Okay. That's fine.

1035
01:01:12,882 --> 01:01:13,929
LIAM: All right, I'm up.

1036
01:01:13,929 --> 01:01:15,013
MATT: Next up is Vax.

1037
01:01:15,013 --> 01:01:17,818
LIAM: Yeah. I'm going to try to unlock the door.

1038
01:01:17,818 --> 01:01:20,681
MATT: All right. You go ahead and you rush over
(whoosh), pull out your lockpicks.

1039
01:01:20,681 --> 01:01:22,960
LIAM: So that's a ten. 23.

1040
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:27,658
MATT: Rain's still pouring down, you have your
hood up, the water's dripping past your face as

1041
01:01:27,658 --> 01:01:31,521
you're trying to concentrate. You get the tools
in. It's not a very complicated lock. (click,

1042
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:35,904
creak) You push it open, leading you guys into the
interior of what looks like a kitchen.

1043
01:01:35,904 --> 01:01:40,665
LIAM: Perception check. Which is a 25.

1044
01:01:40,665 --> 01:01:46,235
MATT: 25. As you look inside, it's a cold kitchen.
It hasn't been in use for a while. The fire's up,

1045
01:01:46,235 --> 01:01:50,836
there's a little bit of a slab in the corner where
most of the preparations are done, there's a few

1046
01:01:50,836 --> 01:01:53,760
cabinets that are up. It's dark. There's no
lantern.

1047
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,419
LIAM: And what are the other doors?

1048
01:01:55,419 --> 01:01:59,322
MATT: There's a door immediately to your left, and
there's, across the way, is an archway opening.

1049
01:01:59,322 --> 01:02:03,435
There's no actual door there. It's just a walkway
that leads into the next room.

1050
01:02:03,435 --> 01:02:04,903
LIAM: So it's open straight ahead?

1051
01:02:04,903 --> 01:02:05,917
MATT: Yes.

1052
01:02:05,917 --> 01:02:11,880
LIAM: I haven't used any movement. If I go to the
archway right across, right?

1053
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:12,856
MATT: Yep.

1054
01:02:12,856 --> 01:02:19,860
LIAM: I'm clicking my boots as I walk forward. Do
I perception check again at the arch, or does the

1055
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:21,464
same one hold?

1056
01:02:21,464 --> 01:02:24,830
MATT: As you glance through, you can see what
appears to be...

1057
01:02:24,830 --> 01:02:29,864
LIAM: I unlocked the door and I've walked ten
feet.

1058
01:02:29,864 --> 01:02:35,860
MATT: There appears to be a hallway. There's a
hallway that goes across the way. There's a door

1059
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:39,267
at the end of the hallway, and two doors to the
right and left of this hallway.

1060
01:02:39,267 --> 01:02:42,119
LIAM: All right, I'm going to juke to the left.
I'm going to go to that door and try the knob.

1061
01:02:42,119 --> 01:02:43,285
MATT: Right here?

1062
01:02:43,285 --> 01:02:45,693
LIAM: Nope, no, the other door in the room I'm
in.

1063
01:02:45,693 --> 01:02:46,523
MATT: Oh, over here?

1064
01:02:46,523 --> 01:02:47,457
LIAM: Yeah.

1065
01:02:47,457 --> 01:02:49,555
MATT: You go over there and you try it. (click) It
opens up.

1066
01:02:49,555 --> 01:02:51,111
LIAM: (singing) Perception!

1067
01:02:51,111 --> 01:02:55,968
MATT: Opens up into what appears to be a storage
room.

1068
01:02:55,968 --> 01:02:57,046
LIAM: Nothing.

1069
01:02:57,046 --> 01:03:00,914
MATT: Series of barrels, small grain sacks in the
far corner. It appears that most of the dry

1070
01:03:00,914 --> 01:03:02,960
storage for the kitchen is kept in this room.

1071
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:06,044
LIAM: All right, so I look straight at Percival.

1072
01:03:06,044 --> 01:03:09,965
TALIESIN: I'm going to go straight through the
hallway and try the door on the left.

1073
01:03:09,965 --> 01:03:13,173
MATT: Okay. Move you forward to do that, you move
in.

1074
01:03:13,173 --> 01:03:17,163
LIAM: I'd like to use the last of my movement just
to stay-- because I've got the boots on, I've got

1075
01:03:17,163 --> 01:03:19,981
a lot of movement left; I can stay ten feet behind
him.

1076
01:03:19,981 --> 01:03:23,734
MATT: You do. Okay. You stay behind him as you
move in. The door, this one here?

1077
01:03:23,734 --> 01:03:26,522
TALIESIN: Yeah, move the one to the right. Yeah,
sure, that one.

1078
01:03:26,522 --> 01:03:33,237
MATT: (shhh) You slide that one open. It appears
to be a bathtub in there. It's a rather nice

1079
01:03:33,237 --> 01:03:36,067
powder room and bathroom.

1080
01:03:36,067 --> 01:03:39,030
TALIESIN: There's no way to just quickly push the
other door open, too, is there?

1081
01:03:39,030 --> 01:03:41,360
MATT: You can try. I'll say for this round, you
can go ahead and open that, look inside for a

1082
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:46,652
second, go for this, just really quick checking
back and forth. This one, this door actually, it

1083
01:03:46,652 --> 01:03:49,574
does not appear to open at a push.

1084
01:03:49,574 --> 01:03:52,553
TALIESIN: And I signal.

1085
01:03:52,553 --> 01:03:54,867
LIAM: Can I, at this point?

1086
01:03:54,867 --> 01:03:56,254
MATT: No, you've already done your move.

1087
01:03:56,254 --> 01:03:57,585
LIAM: And we're on the first floor, right?

1088
01:03:57,585 --> 01:03:59,292
MATT: Yes, you guys are on the base floor.

1089
01:03:59,292 --> 01:04:02,032
TRAVIS: And they're all up on the second floor,
right?

1090
01:04:02,032 --> 01:04:13,626
MATT: Right, that's your go. So. Bringing us to
Count Tylieri's turn. Count Tylieri, who is

1091
01:04:13,626 --> 01:04:18,624
currently looking over the banister. He kind of
steps forward here for a second. Grog, this works

1092
01:04:18,624 --> 01:04:25,479
for you because you look up and see all the guards
there. Tylieri walks up. This rotund-looking,

1093
01:04:25,479 --> 01:04:34,096
slimy individual, thinning hair, very pale skin, a
little bit of facial hair that has never really

1094
01:04:34,096 --> 01:04:36,467
seemed to grow fully in, but he tries to groom the
best he can.

1095
01:04:36,467 --> 01:04:37,859
LAURA: Grog's beard is better than that.

1096
01:04:37,859 --> 01:04:43,294
MATT: Oh, much better. He's wearing fine clothing.
He's got rings encrusting his fingers, but he

1097
01:04:43,294 --> 01:04:50,454
walks with a deftness to the edge of this stairway
and looks over and says, "Interesting. I figured

1098
01:04:50,454 --> 01:04:52,606
"there'd be more of you."

1099
01:04:52,606 --> 01:04:55,167
TRAVIS: Interesting. There's a lot of dead men up
there.

1100
01:04:55,167 --> 01:05:06,549
MATT: (laughs) Of which, you see him leap up onto
the ceiling, (pshh) stick to it. And begin to

1101
01:05:06,549 --> 01:05:08,229
(skittering noise) scatter across.

1102
01:05:08,229 --> 01:05:09,989
LAURA: The one with the shitty beard?

1103
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:10,855
MATT: Yep.

1104
01:05:10,855 --> 01:05:11,714
MARISHA: Tylieri?

1105
01:05:11,714 --> 01:05:12,578
MATT: Yep.

1106
01:05:12,578 --> 01:05:13,664
SAM: He's Spider-man?

1107
01:05:13,664 --> 01:05:22,221
MATT: He jumps up and spider-crawls across the
ceiling, and then drops down. Yeah. With deft

1108
01:05:22,221 --> 01:05:27,786
acrobatic feats, he leaps across, drops and lands
right in front of you. You can see now in his

1109
01:05:27,786 --> 01:05:32,655
face, as slovenly as it is, there is a look of
deathly hunger in his eyes, and fangs bared from

1110
01:05:32,655 --> 01:05:33,760
under his lips.

1111
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,328
TRAVIS: That's a neat trick.

1112
01:05:35,328 --> 01:05:42,058
MATT: He is now going to make two melee attacks
against you. That's a natural 20 with the claw,

1113
01:05:42,058 --> 01:05:45,677
and the other one's going to be a 15? I don't
think it's going to hit.

1114
01:05:45,677 --> 01:05:46,545
TRAVIS: No.

1115
01:05:46,545 --> 01:05:50,433
MATT: So he now has these long claws in his hand.
The first one (whoosh). It catches you off guard

1116
01:05:50,433 --> 01:05:53,228
from the sheer weird assault that he's brought to
you.

1117
01:05:53,228 --> 01:05:55,058
TRAVIS: What's wrong with you?

1118
01:05:55,058 --> 01:06:04,349
MATT: (laughs) You take 16 points of slashing
damage (whoosh) from the first arc, and he goes up

1119
01:06:04,349 --> 01:06:09,070
with the second hand and this time you (grunt)
pull out of the way. His hand manages to knock

1120
01:06:09,070 --> 01:06:11,462
some of the bolts free that were jammed in your
chest.

1121
01:06:11,462 --> 01:06:12,849
TRAVIS: Half the 16, right?

1122
01:06:12,849 --> 01:06:14,502
MATT: Half of 16, correct.

1123
01:06:14,546 --> 01:06:15,695
TRAVIS: So, eight.

1124
01:06:15,695 --> 01:06:19,635
MATT: Because you're raging, so eight on that one.
That's his go. And he just grins at you with this

1125
01:06:19,635 --> 01:06:27,539
hissing sound, licking his fanged lips. That ends
his turn. That brings us to Grog. You're up.

1126
01:06:27,539 --> 01:06:34,387
TRAVIS: (growls) I go into a frenzied rage and I
use reckless attack, along with my great weapon

1127
01:06:34,387 --> 01:06:38,598
master, and I turn that thing into a piece of goo
with my war hammer.

1128
01:06:38,598 --> 01:06:39,766
(laughter)

1129
01:06:39,766 --> 01:06:44,041
MATT: Okay. War hammer (fwoosh) bursts into
flames. Your eyes all of a sudden go into an

1130
01:06:44,041 --> 01:06:48,557
intense glare as you rear up and go into your
frenzied rage. Make your attacks. Do it.

1131
01:06:48,557 --> 01:06:52,319
TRAVIS: Advantage on them. That's much better.
That's 24?

1132
01:06:52,319 --> 01:06:56,299
MATT: 24 hits on the first strike. You only have
advantage on the first attack.

1133
01:06:56,299 --> 01:06:58,475
TRAVIS: Oh, gotcha. Okay. Just the first one.

1134
01:06:58,475 --> 01:07:00,273
MATT: Yeah, the first one's a reckless strike.

1135
01:07:00,273 --> 01:07:01,547
TRAVIS: Okay. 21?

1136
01:07:01,547 --> 01:07:02,842
MATT: Hits, as well.

1137
01:07:02,842 --> 01:07:05,612
TRAVIS: And 20.

1138
01:07:05,612 --> 01:07:06,825
MATT: All three hit.

1139
01:07:06,825 --> 01:07:08,445
TRAVIS: Yes. Okay.

1140
01:07:08,445 --> 01:07:10,525
MATT: That's with the minus five, right?

1141
01:07:10,525 --> 01:07:13,878
MARISHA: Great weapon master?

1142
01:07:13,878 --> 01:07:15,990
MATT: Because of great weapon master, it would be
minus five to each attack.

1143
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:17,316
TRAVIS: No.

1144
01:07:17,316 --> 01:07:18,924
MATT: All right, so the last one was 15?

1145
01:07:18,924 --> 01:07:19,917
TRAVIS: Yes.

1146
01:07:19,917 --> 01:07:20,994
MATT: Last one misses.

1147
01:07:20,994 --> 01:07:21,777
TRAVIS: Okay.

1148
01:07:21,777 --> 01:07:23,055
MATT: But the first two do hit.

1149
01:07:23,055 --> 01:07:25,936
TRAVIS: Okay. I forgot that part. Know your rules,
kids.

1150
01:07:25,936 --> 01:07:30,323
LAURA: Then you add a ten to all of them?

1151
01:07:30,323 --> 01:07:33,861
TRAVIS: 21 for the first one.

1152
01:07:33,861 --> 01:07:34,907
MATT: 21 points of damage.

1153
01:07:34,907 --> 01:07:40,161
TRAVIS: And 20 for the second one, and the third
one misses, right?

1154
01:07:40,208 --> 01:07:41,405
MATT: That's with the fire, right?

1155
01:07:41,543 --> 01:07:42,555
TRAVIS: That's with the fire.

1156
01:07:42,555 --> 01:07:46,636
MATT: Yeah. Third one misses, so 41 points of
damage to him with the first two, (whack, whack),

1157
01:07:46,636 --> 01:07:51,153
the impacts slamming into him. You can see his
body get pushed back with each impact. He's still

1158
01:07:51,153 --> 01:07:54,242
taking it and grinning at you, but he's also
seemingly surprised by the ferocity of the

1159
01:07:54,242 --> 01:07:57,681
strikes. Is that your turn? Are you going to
move?

1160
01:07:57,681 --> 01:08:00,775
TRAVIS: That's it. No, I'm not going to move.

1161
01:08:00,775 --> 01:08:06,923
MATT: Okay. He's going to use one of his legendary
actions to, at the end of your turn, reach out and

1162
01:08:06,923 --> 01:08:10,928
attack you again. That's going to be a 23 to hit?

1163
01:08:10,928 --> 01:08:12,039
TRAVIS: Yep.

1164
01:08:12,039 --> 01:08:16,020
MATT: Instead of attacking, he's going to grapple
you.

1165
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:17,090
TRAVIS: Okay.

1166
01:08:17,090 --> 01:08:20,854
MATT: So his claw goes up and actually (fwoosh)
reaches into your throat, and you can feel the

1167
01:08:20,854 --> 01:08:25,167
claws digging into the flesh. It's a very, very
firm grip and he has you right where he wants you.

1168
01:08:25,167 --> 01:08:27,426
TRAVIS: Work that hand out a lot, do you?

1169
01:08:27,426 --> 01:08:35,525
MATT: That's that action there. All right, that
brings us to the guards. The guards all reload

1170
01:08:35,525 --> 01:08:40,844
their crossbow bolts, move in. These three now see
the bear in the back and they're going to fire on

1171
01:08:40,844 --> 01:08:45,437
Trinket. These seven are all going to fire on
Grog, now that he's held there. So the three

1172
01:08:45,437 --> 01:08:48,277
against Trinket. That's going to be a 16?

1173
01:08:48,277 --> 01:08:49,549
LAURA: Doesn't hit!

1174
01:08:49,549 --> 01:08:52,106
MATT: That's going to be a 20?

1175
01:08:52,106 --> 01:08:53,070
LAURA: Hits.

1176
01:08:53,070 --> 01:08:54,606
MATT: And a 22.

1177
01:08:54,606 --> 01:08:55,822
LAURA: Yeah.

1178
01:08:55,822 --> 01:09:01,926
MATT: So Trinket takes six points of piercing
damage and 11 points of piercing damage. Total of

1179
01:09:01,926 --> 01:09:06,297
17 points of damage to Trinket as two bolts
(shink, shink). One of them bounces off the armor.

1180
01:09:06,297 --> 01:09:09,986
One actually sticks and Trinket, (growls) but it's
not enough to really cause much of a worry.

1181
01:09:09,986 --> 01:09:11,307
LAURA: Yeah, he doesn't care.

1182
01:09:11,307 --> 01:09:21,979
MATT: The other seven against you, Grog. Natural
20. Natural one. That's not going to hit, that's a

1183
01:09:21,979 --> 01:09:24,401
natural five. 18?

1184
01:09:24,401 --> 01:09:26,001
TRAVIS: Misses.

1185
01:09:26,001 --> 01:09:39,124
MATT: Natural one. That's a 19, that hits. A 19
naturally, so it's 27. One more. That's 18 to hit.

1186
01:09:39,124 --> 01:09:40,502
TRAVIS: Misses.

1187
01:09:40,502 --> 01:09:42,511
MATT: Oh, these all have advantage on you because
you did a reckless attack.

1188
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:43,821
TRAVIS: That's right, I did.

1189
01:09:43,821 --> 01:09:45,511
MATT: So the one that would have missed is a
natural 20.

1190
01:09:45,511 --> 01:09:46,891
TRAVIS: Nay!

1191
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:50,766
MATT: That does hit. Natural 20 again.

1192
01:09:50,766 --> 01:09:51,987
MARISHA: What?

1193
01:09:51,987 --> 01:09:54,326
MATT: I'm rolling for all the ones that would have
missed.

1194
01:09:54,326 --> 01:09:55,952
SAM: Why do they have advantage on you?

1195
01:09:55,952 --> 01:09:57,694
TRAVIS: Because I had advantage on mine.

1196
01:09:57,694 --> 01:09:59,043
MATT: Yeah. Reckless attack.

1197
01:09:59,043 --> 01:10:00,384
SAM: That's reckless!

1198
01:10:00,384 --> 01:10:02,354
TRAVIS: (laughs) It is very reckless.

1199
01:10:02,354 --> 01:10:04,259
MATT: They all hit you, three of which are crits.

1200
01:10:04,259 --> 01:10:05,260
TRAVIS: (sarcastically) Yay!

1201
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:06,670
MARISHA: Son of a bitch.

1202
01:10:06,670 --> 01:10:10,389
MATT: First crit is 19 points of piercing damage.

1203
01:10:10,389 --> 01:10:12,080
LIAM: (flatly) Merry Critmas.

1204
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:14,085
LAURA: We're all going to die.

1205
01:10:14,085 --> 01:10:17,185
MATT: The second crit is going to be nine points
of piercing damage.

1206
01:10:17,185 --> 01:10:18,417
TRAVIS: Okay.

1207
01:10:18,417 --> 01:10:21,653
MATT: Last one is going to be another nine points
of piercing damage.

1208
01:10:21,653 --> 01:10:23,916
TRAVIS: Okay, 37 halved.

1209
01:10:23,916 --> 01:10:27,731
MATT: Actually, that would be 15 total because
that was a crit. So the three crits are out of the way.

1210
01:10:27,731 --> 01:10:31,394
TRAVIS: Okay. 37. So, 15 total?

1211
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:33,629
MATT: 15 on the last one, yeah.

1212
01:10:33,629 --> 01:10:34,702
TRAVIS: Okay.

1213
01:10:34,702 --> 01:10:36,709
MATT: And so those are the three crits.

1214
01:10:36,709 --> 01:10:39,802
TRAVIS: 33. What's half of 33?

1215
01:10:39,802 --> 01:10:41,613
LAURA: 16.

1216
01:10:41,613 --> 01:10:43,356
LIAM: 16 or 17. 16.

1217
01:10:43,356 --> 01:10:53,486
MATT: There you go, so that's that. And the next
ones are 11. Another 11.

1218
01:10:53,486 --> 01:10:56,164
TALIESIN: We're going to have to thin these ranks
out quickly.

1219
01:10:56,164 --> 01:11:04,948
MATT: Ten. And seven. So you take another 39
points of piercing damage after that.

1220
01:11:04,948 --> 01:11:10,019
TRAVIS: Okay, I'm going to use my stone's
endurance to get rid of that stank.

1221
01:11:10,019 --> 01:11:12,058
MATT: One of them, yeah.

1222
01:11:12,058 --> 01:11:17,208
TRAVIS: Roll, plus my constitution. 16.

1223
01:11:17,208 --> 01:11:25,633
MATT: Okay, so we'll say you reduce one of the
crits from 16. The first one, take 15 points off

1224
01:11:25,633 --> 01:11:29,255
that because I think one of the crits was 15.
We'll say you used it on that one. That's 39

1225
01:11:29,255 --> 01:11:33,636
points of piercing damage, reduced by half. That
will put you at 18.

1226
01:11:33,636 --> 01:11:35,148
TRAVIS: 18? Okay.

1227
01:11:35,148 --> 01:11:38,402
MATT: We'll say you take 18 points of piercing
damage from those four non-crits.

1228
01:11:38,402 --> 01:11:39,553
TRAVIS: Okay.

1229
01:11:39,553 --> 01:11:45,270
MATT: So yeah. That ends the guards' volley. That
brings us to Vex. You're up.

1230
01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:47,001
LAURA: Me? And Trinket.

1231
01:11:47,001 --> 01:11:48,392
MATT: Yes. And Trinket. Both.

1232
01:11:48,392 --> 01:11:51,245
LAURA: Okay, so I run in after Percy and my
brother.

1233
01:11:51,245 --> 01:11:52,228
MATT: Okay.

1234
01:11:52,228 --> 01:11:58,149
LAURA: And Trinket--

1235
01:11:58,149 --> 01:12:02,890
MATT: Are you going to dash? Because you can move,
you can double move, using your action to move, if

1236
01:12:02,890 --> 01:12:03,823
you want.

1237
01:12:03,823 --> 01:12:05,119
LAURA: Oh, I can?

1238
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:09,813
MATT: Yeah. Unless you want to use your action to
yell out for Trinket to attack, in which case, you

1239
01:12:09,813 --> 01:12:11,124
can give Trinket a round of combat.

1240
01:12:11,124 --> 01:12:12,794
LAURA: Oh, I do want to give Trinket a round of
combat, so yes.

1241
01:12:12,794 --> 01:12:14,073
MATT: Okay.

1242
01:12:14,073 --> 01:12:18,295
LAURA: And he gets a couple of attacks if I don't
attack at all, right?

1243
01:12:18,295 --> 01:12:19,859
MATT: Correct. Yep.

1244
01:12:19,859 --> 01:12:25,809
LAURA: So that's good. (screams) Okay, Trinket
gets two attacks because of bestial fury.

1245
01:12:25,809 --> 01:12:26,625
MATT: Correct.

1246
01:12:26,625 --> 01:12:27,904
LIAM: He hears your voice!

1247
01:12:27,904 --> 01:12:33,414
LAURA: Because he hears my voice. So he's going to
run around and he's going to try to knock over--

1248
01:12:33,414 --> 01:12:37,078
he's going to cannonball into the vampire guy.

1249
01:12:37,078 --> 01:12:39,818
MATT: Okay, so he's going to move this way and
then cannonball forward?

1250
01:12:39,818 --> 01:12:40,739
LAURA: Yeah.

1251
01:12:40,739 --> 01:12:43,933
MATT: Okay. Trinket moves off to the side.
(thudding footsteps) Gets a couple of running

1252
01:12:43,933 --> 01:12:49,096
starts, and then rolls into a roly-poly style
forward. All right, so make one attack against him.

1253
01:12:49,096 --> 01:12:53,829
LAURA: Okay. Okay. What do I add to that?

1254
01:12:53,829 --> 01:12:56,477
MATT: Your attack bonus for Trinket.

1255
01:12:56,477 --> 01:13:01,559
LIAM: I don't know, for your bear. AC, HP, bite
attack, claw attack, plus eight.

1256
01:13:01,559 --> 01:13:03,978
MATT: Yes, plus eight just for the attack.

1257
01:13:03,978 --> 01:13:05,276
LAURA: Okay, 15?

1258
01:13:05,276 --> 01:13:10,164
MATT: 15 does not hit, unfortunately. So Trinket
rolls past. He dodges out of the way, gets an

1259
01:13:10,164 --> 01:13:16,845
attack of opportunity on him because he wasn't hit
as part of the attack. That's a 27 to hit. Trinket

1260
01:13:16,845 --> 01:13:24,938
takes seven plus three, ten points of slashing
damage as he streaks by. Seeing the bear coming at

1261
01:13:24,938 --> 01:13:28,077
him too soon and managing to both pull out of the
way and use that to his advantage.

1262
01:13:28,077 --> 01:13:33,075
TALIESIN: I'm going to be playing rule Nazi
tonight. Is that attack of opportunity possible

1263
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:35,129
since he's grappling somebody?

1264
01:13:35,129 --> 01:13:40,015
MATT: Technically, yes. He's just grappling with
one hand and just dodges out of the way, moves

1265
01:13:40,015 --> 01:13:41,679
over and slashes with the other hand.

1266
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:43,034
TALIESIN: Trying everything I can to save this
bear.

1267
01:13:43,034 --> 01:13:44,483
MATT: I know you, man. It's okay.

1268
01:13:44,483 --> 01:13:46,020
(laughter)

1269
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:53,444
LAURA: Trinket then comes out of cannonball and
tries to bite the back of the vampire's neck.

1270
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:56,711
MATT: Okay. I'll let you do that because this is
your full round to do that. Usually you would

1271
01:13:56,711 --> 01:13:57,864
choose to cannonball--

1272
01:13:57,864 --> 01:13:59,577
LAURA: Or I do my two attacks?

1273
01:13:59,577 --> 01:14:02,477
MATT: But because you aren't part of this combat
fray and you're giving all of your round to him,

1274
01:14:02,477 --> 01:14:03,587
I'll let you do it, sure.

1275
01:14:03,587 --> 01:14:04,577
LAURA: Okay. Thank you.

1276
01:14:04,577 --> 01:14:08,418
MATT: Trinket comes out of the roll, turns around
(roars) and strikes with the claw, swiping--

1277
01:14:08,418 --> 01:14:10,447
LAURA: He's trying to bite his neck like a
vampire!

1278
01:14:10,447 --> 01:14:11,931
MATT: Oh, bite him? Okay.

1279
01:14:11,931 --> 01:14:14,665
LAURA: Oh, shit. Ooh! That's good. 27.

1280
01:14:14,665 --> 01:14:15,571
MATT: That hits.

1281
01:14:15,571 --> 01:14:18,099
LIAM: Split his head like a gourd.

1282
01:14:18,099 --> 01:14:21,144
LAURA: 11.

1283
01:14:21,144 --> 01:14:26,658
MATT: 11 points of damage as Trinket latches onto
the back of his shoulder (growls) and pulls and

1284
01:14:26,658 --> 01:14:30,760
tugs at him, trying to get him loose from Grog's
grip. Not strong enough to do so, but he

1285
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:37,096
nevertheless takes the damage and (snarls) hisses
back at the bear clutched onto his shoulder. Cool.

1286
01:14:37,096 --> 01:14:39,216
That ends your turn. Keyleth, you're up.

1287
01:14:39,216 --> 01:14:45,795
MARISHA: Okay, can I see the smoke from the fire
rising up from what Scanlan did on the other

1288
01:14:45,795 --> 01:14:46,990
house?

1289
01:14:46,990 --> 01:14:52,403
MATT: At this point? Make a perception check. It's
a heavy storm.

1290
01:14:52,403 --> 01:14:54,621
MARISHA: That's not great. 12?

1291
01:14:54,621 --> 01:15:00,660
MATT: 12? Currently, in the storm, you're just not
able to really make up any visual in the distance

1292
01:15:00,660 --> 01:15:04,822
right now, no. You do not know if there is any
fire going on or any signal, at this point.

1293
01:15:04,899 --> 01:15:14,686
MARISHA: Okay. Shit. Are there any other windows
along the back side of the house?

1294
01:15:14,686 --> 01:15:17,188
MATT: Over here? Yeah, there's a window there,
window there, window there.

1295
01:15:17,188 --> 01:15:18,403
MARISHA: Through the side.

1296
01:15:18,403 --> 01:15:21,615
MATT: Oh, back here? This side, there are no other
windows. It is completely closed off.

1297
01:15:21,615 --> 01:15:24,225
MARISHA: No other windows?

1298
01:15:24,225 --> 01:15:28,008
MATT: Nope, there's just the one entry there that
everyone else went in through.

1299
01:15:28,008 --> 01:15:39,634
MARISHA: Shit. Okay, I'll go inside.

1300
01:15:39,634 --> 01:15:43,982
SAM: Hello, is there anyone in here?

1301
01:15:43,982 --> 01:15:48,255
MARISHA: Is there anything in this direction? This
way? Can we not get this way?

1302
01:15:48,255 --> 01:15:54,471
MATT: This is a storage closet that was already
checked by Vax, who walked past it.

1303
01:15:54,471 --> 01:15:57,552
MARISHA: Do we know if there are any outside doors
over here on this side?

1304
01:15:57,552 --> 01:16:00,166
MATT: You don't, no. No one's moved all the way in
to see, and it's not very well-lit in there,

1305
01:16:00,166 --> 01:16:01,617
currently.

1306
01:16:01,617 --> 01:16:06,137
MARISHA: Could I have gone around the edge here to
see? Would we have known, going on this side, if

1307
01:16:06,137 --> 01:16:07,182
there were any doors?

1308
01:16:07,182 --> 01:16:10,391
MATT: No, because you guys approached from that
side. You saw windows, but it was fairly dark. You

1309
01:16:10,391 --> 01:16:14,627
saw a little bit of light moving through some of
the windows on the second story, but nothing down

1310
01:16:14,775 --> 01:16:16,761
here that really caught your attention.

1311
01:16:16,761 --> 01:16:19,246
MARISHA: And we still have no way into this main
room, either, yet?

1312
01:16:19,246 --> 01:16:22,161
MATT: Not yet. There is a door at the end of this
hallway, but nobody's gotten to try it yet.

1313
01:16:22,161 --> 01:16:24,704
TRAVIS: Could you get to a second-floor window?

1314
01:16:24,704 --> 01:16:27,727
MATT: You could push past your party and continue
to move down the hallway, if you want.

1315
01:16:27,727 --> 01:16:30,940
LAURA: Second floor's better than first floor,
anyway.

1316
01:16:30,940 --> 01:16:33,504
MARISHA: Okay. I'm sorry. I'm an asshole.

1317
01:16:33,504 --> 01:16:36,345
SAM: You turn into an asshole.

1318
01:16:36,345 --> 01:16:43,592
MARISHA: (giggling) I turn into an asshole. Were
there any-- fuck, I really don't want to have to

1319
01:16:43,592 --> 01:16:46,174
blow-- okay, so I'm going to---

1320
01:16:46,174 --> 01:16:47,858
MATT: What are you going to do?

1321
01:16:47,858 --> 01:16:50,391
MARISHA: Yeah, you know what? I didn't go inside.
I'm outside.

1322
01:16:50,391 --> 01:16:53,106
MATT: You came inside. Not going to retcon it.

1323
01:16:53,106 --> 01:16:55,244
MARISHA: Dick. All right.

1324
01:16:55,244 --> 01:16:57,921
MATT: I'm just saying! You can't get halfway in
there and be like, "Wait, this didn't happen."

1325
01:16:57,921 --> 01:17:00,234
MARISHA: Okay.

1326
01:17:00,234 --> 01:17:03,291
LIAM: Technically, none of this happened.

1327
01:17:03,291 --> 01:17:06,404
TALIESIN: Thank you for coming with me on that
journey.

1328
01:17:06,404 --> 01:17:15,311
MARISHA: Fine, I'll just see if this fucking door
is open. That's all I can do right now.

1329
01:17:15,311 --> 01:17:16,871
MATT: The one across the way?

1330
01:17:16,871 --> 01:17:17,764
MARISHA: Yeah.

1331
01:17:17,764 --> 01:17:18,565
MATT: Okay.

1332
01:17:18,565 --> 01:17:20,271
MARISHA: Sorry, guys, excuse me. Sorry, excuse
me.

1333
01:17:20,271 --> 01:17:24,451
MATT: You push past everyone. You push on the
door. It opens up and reveals a long dining room,

1334
01:17:24,451 --> 01:17:30,748
a big, thick dining room table, a double window
across the way. This is the house's dining room.

1335
01:17:30,748 --> 01:17:34,715
There are two double doors across the way that
lead into what you think is the foyer, in which

1336
01:17:34,715 --> 01:17:39,434
Grog and Trinket currently stormed through. And
you can hear, muffled through the door in the

1337
01:17:39,434 --> 01:17:42,724
distance, the sound of combat and impact and
people shouting to each other.

1338
01:17:42,724 --> 01:17:49,506
MARISHA: Okay, can I cross over to that window and
look out the front window? The window over here?

1339
01:17:49,506 --> 01:17:54,878
MATT: I'll say you can get that far, and you can
just crest and look out the window if you want to.

1340
01:17:54,878 --> 01:17:57,186
MARISHA: Do I see any fire from Scanlan?

1341
01:17:57,186 --> 01:18:02,195
MATT: From this point, you've already checked
once. You're just getting in there. You won't be

1342
01:18:02,195 --> 01:18:03,785
able to really see from here.

1343
01:18:03,785 --> 01:18:04,972
MARISHA: That's my turn.

1344
01:18:04,972 --> 01:18:07,420
MATT: That brings us to the top. Percy, you're
up.

1345
01:18:07,420 --> 01:18:12,055
MARISHA: Oh, yeah. Can I call him? Can I,
(whispering) "Scanlan. Scanlan!"

1346
01:18:12,055 --> 01:18:17,565
MATT: You make a little bit of a calling noise.
You hear nothing back. You fear you might be just

1347
01:18:17,565 --> 01:18:18,881
out of range for it.

1348
01:18:18,881 --> 01:18:20,764
MARISHA: Son of a bitch. All right.

1349
01:18:20,764 --> 01:18:22,723
TALIESIN: I'm going to make a run for the door.

1350
01:18:22,723 --> 01:18:29,854
MATT: Okay. You can get to there. You're just at
the edge of it. Do you want to try and knock it

1351
01:18:29,854 --> 01:18:31,386
open?

1352
01:18:31,386 --> 01:18:34,701
TALIESIN: Is it open? Can I open the door?

1353
01:18:34,701 --> 01:18:39,479
MATT: You can try to. You reach out. (creak) It
opens up and you can see now, a light comes

1354
01:18:39,479 --> 01:18:43,487
pouring through from the foyer, and you can hear
much louder now, the sound of combat, and Grog

1355
01:18:43,487 --> 01:18:47,396
chuckling, and swings and impacts. You can see a
couple of crossbow bolts go (boof)

1356
01:18:47,444 --> 01:18:49,632
and scatter across the ground.

1357
01:18:49,775 --> 01:18:53,100
TALIESIN: I would have to use my action to move?

1358
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:54,468
MATT: Correct.

1359
01:18:54,468 --> 01:19:03,711
TALIESIN: You know... (sighs) Yeah, this is going
to be worthwhile. I'm going to-- well...

1360
01:19:03,711 --> 01:19:05,037
(laughter)

1361
01:19:05,037 --> 01:19:06,034
MATT: What are you doing?

1362
01:19:06,034 --> 01:19:07,009
TALIESIN: I hate you.

1363
01:19:07,009 --> 01:19:08,166
MATT: What are you doing?

1364
01:19:08,166 --> 01:19:09,321
SAM: Kill things.

1365
01:19:09,321 --> 01:19:10,678
MARISHA: Shoot out the window.

1366
01:19:10,678 --> 01:19:12,249
TALIESIN: Shoot out the window?

1367
01:19:12,249 --> 01:19:15,553
LAURA: Just act on the fly like Scanlan did. It
turned out okay.

1368
01:19:15,553 --> 01:19:18,528
MATT: Do your thing, Percy. Do your thing. What
are you doing?

1369
01:19:18,528 --> 01:19:23,866
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to be helpful. I'm going
to burn my action to get into the room.

1370
01:19:23,866 --> 01:19:25,342
MATT: Okay. Where do you want to get on this
side?

1371
01:19:25,342 --> 01:19:26,153
TALIESIN: Right there.

1372
01:19:26,153 --> 01:19:27,073
MATT: Right there?

1373
01:19:27,073 --> 01:19:28,512
TALIESIN: Yeah, I want to stand right there.

1374
01:19:28,512 --> 01:19:31,550
MATT: Okay, so you just swing around (fwwwt) to
the inside. You look up and immediately you see

1375
01:19:31,550 --> 01:19:35,698
this curved banister and a whole row of guards up
top with heavy crossbows. In the center, you can

1376
01:19:35,698 --> 01:19:42,313
see some blur as Grog, Trinket, and some
individual are in the middle of this tussle. The

1377
01:19:42,313 --> 01:19:47,637
individual currently has Grog grasped by the
throat.

1378
01:19:47,637 --> 01:19:57,344
TALIESIN: How crazy-- I don't know if I can do
Minor Illusion that way right now. So I'm going to

1379
01:19:57,344 --> 01:20:00,858
call Hex on that first guard there.

1380
01:20:00,858 --> 01:20:02,929
MATT: Which one? Right there?

1381
01:20:02,929 --> 01:20:03,912
TALIESIN: Yep.

1382
01:20:03,912 --> 01:20:04,738
MATT: Okay.

1383
01:20:04,738 --> 01:20:11,682
TALIESIN: I'm going to burn my action surge, and
I'm going to start taking my shots, and I'm just

1384
01:20:11,682 --> 01:20:13,228
going to work my way up.

1385
01:20:13,228 --> 01:20:16,390
MATT: Okay, so you swing around the corner and
look up at the one guard. As you concentrate for a

1386
01:20:16,390 --> 01:20:20,041
second, bringing your gun up, your eyes begin to
go black again, the smoke pouring out from the

1387
01:20:20,041 --> 01:20:23,367
corner of it. Smoke begins to pour out of the
midsection of the guard, who looks confused for a

1388
01:20:23,411 --> 01:20:29,030
second, and it swirls around him as part of the
Hex that has him marked, as you release your next

1389
01:20:29,030 --> 01:20:30,516
three blasts.

1390
01:20:30,516 --> 01:20:33,225
TALIESIN: Okay. This is with sharpshooter.

1391
01:20:33,225 --> 01:20:34,464
MATT: Okay.

1392
01:20:34,464 --> 01:20:40,437
TALIESIN: That sucks. Ten?

1393
01:20:40,437 --> 01:20:46,621
MATT: Ten misses. First shot just (ricochet noise)
goes wide, blasting a chunk out of the upstairs

1394
01:20:46,621 --> 01:20:48,879
hallway.

1395
01:20:48,879 --> 01:20:50,878
TALIESIN: 11.

1396
01:20:50,878 --> 01:20:55,442
MATT: 11 also goes wide. This time (ricochet
noise) blasting part of the banister in front. The

1397
01:20:55,442 --> 01:20:58,564
guard dodges out of the way as the wood splinters
past him.

1398
01:20:58,564 --> 01:21:00,215
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

1399
01:21:00,215 --> 01:21:01,628
MARISHA: That's better!

1400
01:21:01,628 --> 01:21:04,278
MATT: That's the Percy we know. (laughs)

1401
01:21:04,278 --> 01:21:10,400
TALIESIN: And so since that was a third shot, it
was also a bonus shot, so that's got an extra--

1402
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:13,206
okay! Does that mean that everything gets
doubled?

1403
01:21:13,206 --> 01:21:15,431
MATT: All dice gets doubled, and then you add the
modifier.

1404
01:21:15,431 --> 01:21:16,754
TALIESIN: Not the modifier, though?

1405
01:21:16,754 --> 01:21:18,379
MATT: Not the modifier, no.

1406
01:21:18,379 --> 01:21:19,521
TALIESIN: Modifier stays the same.

1407
01:21:19,521 --> 01:21:20,481
MATT: Correct.

1408
01:21:20,481 --> 01:21:23,729
TALIESIN: Roll twice, or just double my die?

1409
01:21:23,729 --> 01:21:25,812
MATT: Double the die. It's faster.

1410
01:21:25,812 --> 01:21:32,466
TALIESIN: Okay, so that's-- I should have just
used my--

1411
01:21:32,514 --> 01:21:34,293
SAM: What device?

1412
01:21:34,293 --> 01:21:36,153
TALIESIN: I know! I should have just used it.

1413
01:21:36,153 --> 01:21:37,660
MARISHA: That's not bad, though.

1414
01:21:37,660 --> 01:21:46,929
TALIESIN: Nine, 13, 26. 42 points of damage.

1415
01:21:46,929 --> 01:21:49,512
MATT: 42 points of damage?

1416
01:21:49,512 --> 01:21:51,561
TALIESIN: And four of that was fire damage.

1417
01:21:51,561 --> 01:21:56,376
MATT: And four of that was fire damage? Okay. As
you look up, (doosh) the first two shots fire and

1418
01:21:56,376 --> 01:22:00,487
go wide. The third one, (explosion noise) just
explodes and in a blast of black smoke, the

1419
01:22:00,487 --> 01:22:02,725
guard's head is no longer across his shoulders.

1420
01:22:02,725 --> 01:22:04,428
(cheering)

1421
01:22:04,428 --> 01:22:12,258
TALIESIN: Okay, I move the black cloud to the next
guard. He also gains disadvantage on all-- let's

1422
01:22:12,258 --> 01:22:14,558
make it dexterity saving throws.

1423
01:22:14,558 --> 01:22:16,207
MATT: Ability checks.

1424
01:22:16,207 --> 01:22:18,146
TALIESIN: Ability checks, yeah, so all dex
checks.

1425
01:22:18,146 --> 01:22:22,811
MATT: So the smoke (whoosh) pours off the body and
coalesces around the next guard to his right. All

1426
01:22:22,811 --> 01:22:24,019
right, that ends your turn.

1427
01:22:24,019 --> 01:22:25,772
TALIESIN: That's the end of my turn.

1428
01:22:25,772 --> 01:22:26,703
MATT: Vax.

1429
01:22:26,703 --> 01:22:30,764
LIAM: All right, I've got double speed. I go right
towards the table, make an acrobatics check to

1430
01:22:30,764 --> 01:22:32,673
slide my ass across it--

1431
01:22:32,673 --> 01:22:34,106
SAM: Are you doing what I did?

1432
01:22:34,106 --> 01:22:35,520
MATT: Do an acrobatics check.

1433
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:37,079
MARISHA: Yes! Dukes of Hazzard!

1434
01:22:37,079 --> 01:22:40,148
LIAM: Yeah. That is a 23?

1435
01:22:40,148 --> 01:22:41,957
MATT: You (shhht) slide to there.

1436
01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:43,510
SAM: You did it so much cooler than me!

1437
01:22:43,510 --> 01:22:44,546
(laughter)

1438
01:22:44,546 --> 01:22:47,341
LIAM: I want to slide into a crouch right behind--
I don't want to go that far. Right by Percy,

1439
01:22:47,341 --> 01:22:49,824
because I can't go much further, I don't think.

1440
01:22:49,824 --> 01:22:51,078
MATT: At double movement?

1441
01:22:51,113 --> 01:22:55,806
LIAM: Would I be able to make it to Grog and his
friend?

1442
01:22:55,806 --> 01:22:58,963
If I can't make it to Grog, I want to stay
at the door. If I can make it to Grog, I want to

1443
01:22:59,074 --> 01:22:59,970
go to Grog.

1444
01:22:59,970 --> 01:23:02,904
MATT: Slide will give you movement. Yeah, you can
get next to him.

1445
01:23:02,904 --> 01:23:07,208
LIAM: I don't want to go next to him, I want to go
and eviscerate the bowels of the fucker who's

1446
01:23:07,208 --> 01:23:08,374
fucking with him.

1447
01:23:08,374 --> 01:23:09,214
MATT: Okay, so right there?

1448
01:23:09,214 --> 01:23:10,037
LIAM: Yeah.

1449
01:23:10,037 --> 01:23:11,046
MATT: Okay. Yeah, you can get up there.

1450
01:23:11,046 --> 01:23:12,475
LIAM: Sneak attack because he's engaged with
Grog.

1451
01:23:12,475 --> 01:23:13,252
MATT: Correct.

1452
01:23:13,252 --> 01:23:14,233
LIAM: So here comes the total.

1453
01:23:14,233 --> 01:23:22,798
MARISHA: As he slides over the table in front of
me, I go, "That was pretty awesome. Bye. Good luck."

1454
01:23:22,798 --> 01:23:24,615
LIAM: All right, so...

1455
01:23:24,615 --> 01:23:25,760
SAM: You need some daggers?

1456
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:26,803
LIAM: No.

1457
01:23:26,803 --> 01:23:28,003
MATT: More daggers!

1458
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:33,387
LIAM: Wait. So. I'm alive! Rogue rules--

1459
01:23:33,387 --> 01:23:34,578
MATT: Whatcha doing?

1460
01:23:34,578 --> 01:23:35,706
LAURA: What are you doing?

1461
01:23:35,706 --> 01:23:39,406
LIAM: Oh, I'm stabbing the guy three times! I'm
doing my catchphrase, man. Dagger, dagger, dagger!

1462
01:23:39,406 --> 01:23:45,871
Oh, he's already taken a turn in combat, okay. So.
I'm going to use luck on that first attack and go

1463
01:23:45,871 --> 01:23:52,623
again-- ooh, and I'll use the first one. So the
first one was an 8 plus... 19 on the first?

1464
01:23:52,623 --> 01:23:53,779
MATT: 19 hits.

1465
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:56,610
LIAM: All right. Second is a 19?

1466
01:23:56,610 --> 01:23:57,929
MATT: Hits.

1467
01:23:57,929 --> 01:24:00,166
LIAM: Third is 23.

1468
01:24:00,166 --> 01:24:03,568
MATT: All three hit. Go ahead and roll damage.
Sneak attack on the first one.

1469
01:24:03,568 --> 01:24:12,312
LIAM: All right, first one, I'm going to use my
Flametongue. It's two plus... nine. And here comes

1470
01:24:12,312 --> 01:24:24,307
the juice. Nine, 13, 17, 18, 20, 23, 25? That's
the first one, and then second attack is three.

1471
01:24:24,307 --> 01:24:34,776
This is the keen dagger, that's a ten. And the
third attack is the Flametongue again for seven.

1472
01:24:34,776 --> 01:24:42,545
MATT: Seven. Okay, gotcha. So you (fwoosh) dart in
a blur of darkness. You come swinging up. You can

1473
01:24:42,545 --> 01:24:46,334
see Tylieri is currently grasping Grog. Out of the
corner of his eye, just sees the movement and

1474
01:24:46,334 --> 01:24:50,729
looks over curiously as the blade is immediately
in his side. (pained scream) And now you can see

1475
01:24:50,729 --> 01:24:55,947
the jowls shake from the impact of the dagger
blow, and he looks down angrily at you, fangs

1476
01:24:55,947 --> 01:24:58,621
bared as the two other attacks hit his side.

1477
01:24:58,621 --> 01:25:00,621
LIAM: Yeah, I'm looking him right in the eye as I
do that, too.

1478
01:25:00,621 --> 01:25:03,583
MATT: At the end of your turn, he uses two of his
legendary actions--

1479
01:25:03,583 --> 01:25:06,193
LIAM: I'm wearing my helmet, my shiny helmet.

1480
01:25:06,193 --> 01:25:10,978
MATT: I know. To look at you, reach up with the
throat that he's grasped, and sink his fangs

1481
01:25:10,978 --> 01:25:13,603
directly into your throat, Grog.

1482
01:25:13,603 --> 01:25:15,718
TRAVIS: (angry noise) I have a little collar. Does
that help at all?

1483
01:25:15,718 --> 01:25:21,982
MATT: Not in this moment. You have a big neck.
Very big neck, and a very tiny collar. (laughs)

1484
01:25:21,982 --> 01:25:24,775
That will be a 20 to hit?

1485
01:25:24,775 --> 01:25:25,955
TRAVIS: Yep.

1486
01:25:25,955 --> 01:25:31,594
MATT: All righty. So you take nine points of
piercing damage.

1487
01:25:31,594 --> 01:25:32,821
TRAVIS: Is that halved?

1488
01:25:32,821 --> 01:25:36,183
MATT: That is halved. Yeah. So say five, round up.

1489
01:25:36,217 --> 01:25:37,328
TRAVIS: Sure.

1490
01:25:37,328 --> 01:25:47,609
MATT: However, you do take 14 points of necrotic
damage. That is not reduced. But your maximum hit

1491
01:25:47,609 --> 01:25:50,178
points are now reduced by 14.

1492
01:25:50,178 --> 01:25:51,858
TRAVIS: Got it.

1493
01:25:51,858 --> 01:25:55,585
MATT: As you feel that same similar cold feeling
as the life blood's being drained out of your body

1494
01:25:55,585 --> 01:26:00,609
and you see his eyes cresting at you with this
wild glare. That ends your turn, Vax?

1495
01:26:00,609 --> 01:26:02,104
LIAM: Yeah, that's it.

1496
01:26:02,104 --> 01:26:03,989
MATT: It is now his turn.

1497
01:26:03,989 --> 01:26:05,391
SAM: Spider-man?

1498
01:26:05,391 --> 01:26:10,115
MATT: Yeah, now he's taking his turn. He's now
going to go ahead and make another bite attack on

1499
01:26:10,115 --> 01:26:14,316
you again. As he pulls back and reaches his
forearm and grabs the other side of your throat,

1500
01:26:14,316 --> 01:26:15,832
going for the other side of the jugular.

1501
01:26:15,832 --> 01:26:17,182
TRAVIS: Isn't this a Grog buffet?

1502
01:26:17,182 --> 01:26:18,381
MATT: That's a natural one, though.

1503
01:26:18,381 --> 01:26:19,818
(cheering)

1504
01:26:19,818 --> 01:26:22,139
SAM: Oh, because you've got your necklace on.

1505
01:26:22,139 --> 01:26:26,426
MATT: However, he does have advantage on you
because you used your reckless strike.

1506
01:26:26,426 --> 01:26:29,025
SAM: Never use reckless strike again.

1507
01:26:29,025 --> 01:26:35,036
LIAM: Doesn't it cancel out after one roll?
Advantage versus disadvantage is one roll, right?

1508
01:26:35,036 --> 01:26:36,825
TRAVIS: It ended on the first attack, right?

1509
01:26:36,825 --> 01:26:39,870
MATT: It was a one on the first attack, yeah. It's
until your next turn. Attacks against you get

1510
01:26:39,870 --> 01:26:41,105
advantage.

1511
01:26:41,105 --> 01:26:42,413
TRAVIS: Oh, I thought his first bite was the first
one.

1512
01:26:42,413 --> 01:26:45,992
SAM: Wait, so all attacks, even follow-up attacks
get advantage, even though he only gets advantage

1513
01:26:45,992 --> 01:26:46,972
on the first one?

1514
01:26:46,972 --> 01:26:50,196
MATT: I'll read it for you right now. It's a cool
ability when you're not the only tank in the room.

1515
01:26:50,196 --> 01:26:52,773
SAM: No, it is not! It's the worst ability ever.

1516
01:26:52,773 --> 01:26:55,012
LAURA: It's a good ability if you're only fighting
one person.

1517
01:26:55,012 --> 01:26:59,121
MATT: Yeah, but attack rolls against you have
advantage until your next turn.

1518
01:26:59,121 --> 01:27:01,024
LIAM: Because he's out of it. He's going cuckoo.

1519
01:27:01,024 --> 01:27:03,299
SAM: Wait, did you not have-- Jesus, never use
that thing again.

1520
01:27:03,299 --> 01:27:04,860
TRAVIS: I'm using it every time.

1521
01:27:04,860 --> 01:27:06,270
(laughter)

1522
01:27:06,270 --> 01:27:10,878
MATT: Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon
attack rolls using strength during this turn. So

1523
01:27:10,878 --> 01:27:13,986
yes, I apologize. It does give you advantage on
all of your attacks. I misread that.

1524
01:27:13,986 --> 01:27:17,303
TRAVIS: (quietly) Oh, shitfuck. (louder) That's
okay. That's okay!

1525
01:27:17,303 --> 01:27:20,079
LIAM: Stuff happens. Give him a bonus 15 HP or
something.

1526
01:27:20,079 --> 01:27:22,020
MATT: That's okay. Yeah, it's fine. But going
forward, good to know. So it does give you

1527
01:27:22,020 --> 01:27:23,039
advantage on all of your attacks.

1528
01:27:23,039 --> 01:27:23,874
TRAVIS: Copy that.

1529
01:27:23,874 --> 01:27:26,224
MATT: It's the first attack is the one that
confused me on the way it was worded. Sorry,

1530
01:27:26,224 --> 01:27:33,251
folks. I know better now. But for that, I say the
one stands as retribution for me forgetting the rule.

1531
01:27:33,251 --> 01:27:34,859
(cheering)

1532
01:27:34,859 --> 01:27:38,200
MATT: So he goes in to strike for the bite. This
time, however, he does manage to catch the

1533
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:42,514
chainmail coif that Scanlan had made you. His
fangs get caught on the chain. (grunts)

1534
01:27:42,514 --> 01:27:44,821
TRAVIS: Like making out with braces.

1535
01:27:44,821 --> 01:27:50,961
MATT: He pulls away, releases you-- no, doesn't
release you. As he's holding you there, he's going

1536
01:27:50,961 --> 01:27:59,252
to go ahead and make a claw strike across your
face. Two and, oh. That'll be a 19.

1537
01:27:59,252 --> 01:28:00,449
TRAVIS: That does hit.

1538
01:28:00,449 --> 01:28:06,774
MATT: He does hit? Okay. You take eight points of
slashing damage, reduced to four because of your

1539
01:28:06,774 --> 01:28:09,644
rage. That ends his turn. Grog, you're up now.

1540
01:28:09,644 --> 01:28:11,917
TRAVIS: Am I still grappled?

1541
01:28:11,917 --> 01:28:13,236
MATT: You're still grappled, yeah.

1542
01:28:13,236 --> 01:28:14,598
TRAVIS: I'd like to try and break the grapple.

1543
01:28:14,598 --> 01:28:18,118
MATT: Okay, so you use your action to try and
break the grapple. So athletics roll of?

1544
01:28:18,118 --> 01:28:20,060
TRAVIS: 22.

1545
01:28:20,060 --> 01:28:22,524
MATT: Yeah, you (boof) just shove him off without
a problem.

1546
01:28:22,524 --> 01:28:23,492
TRAVIS: Awesome.

1547
01:28:23,492 --> 01:28:25,387
MATT: You still have your bonus action to strike,
if you like.

1548
01:28:25,387 --> 01:28:28,925
TRAVIS: Can I use my bonus action to try and
grapple him back?

1549
01:28:28,925 --> 01:28:31,959
MATT: Not as a bonus action, unfortunately. It's
an action to do that.

1550
01:28:31,959 --> 01:28:36,243
TRAVIS: I will attack, yeah. Just one, right?
(whoosh)

1551
01:28:36,243 --> 01:28:37,448
MATT: One strike, yeah.

1552
01:28:37,448 --> 01:28:40,511
TRAVIS: Okay. Fuck yes! 21?

1553
01:28:40,511 --> 01:28:42,272
MATT: 21 does hit, yeah.

1554
01:28:42,272 --> 01:28:53,506
TRAVIS: Awesome! And that is badass. Nine, 17. 22.
22 with the fire damage.

1555
01:28:53,506 --> 01:28:58,519
MATT: 22 damage. All right. (whack) And you're
watching, as he does all these actions, you see

1556
01:28:58,519 --> 01:29:03,317
his body begin to reform and the wounds beginning
to heal themselves in the vampiric manner. But as

1557
01:29:03,317 --> 01:29:08,226
soon as that wound begins to sew up, you take
your hammer and (boof) slam it into him again,

1558
01:29:08,367 --> 01:29:12,687
reopening, and you can see now parts of his
muscles are exposed, a deep purplish color, this

1559
01:29:12,687 --> 01:29:19,727
very unnatural interior to his flesh. You can see
it burn as the flames cauterize the edges of the

1560
01:29:19,727 --> 01:29:23,499
wound. Awesome. Does that finish your turn? Do you
want to move at all?

1561
01:29:23,499 --> 01:29:26,245
TRAVIS: I'm staying. Is Trinket still behind me?

1562
01:29:26,245 --> 01:29:30,407
MATT: Trinket is currently flanking the guy.

1563
01:29:30,407 --> 01:29:33,047
TRAVIS: Yeah, no. I'll stay.

1564
01:29:33,047 --> 01:29:43,595
MATT: Okay, that brings us to the guards' turn.
They all reload their crossbows. These four are

1565
01:29:43,595 --> 01:29:50,431
now going to make shots at you, Percy. These three
are going to take shots-- all five of these guys

1566
01:29:50,431 --> 01:29:53,153
are going to take shots at Grog now. They're
trying to take you down so they can move onto the

1567
01:29:53,153 --> 01:30:00,060
next target. So four shots on you, Percy. That is
20?

1568
01:30:00,060 --> 01:30:01,465
TALIESIN: That hits.

1569
01:30:01,465 --> 01:30:03,277
MATT: 18?

1570
01:30:03,277 --> 01:30:04,853
TALIESIN: That hits.

1571
01:30:04,853 --> 01:30:06,208
MATT: 20?

1572
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:07,571
TALIESIN: That hits.

1573
01:30:07,571 --> 01:30:10,025
MATT: And 11.

1574
01:30:10,025 --> 01:30:11,501
TALIESIN: That does not hit.

1575
01:30:11,501 --> 01:30:25,559
MATT: Okay, so you take from three heavy crossbow
bolts at you. Seven, 19, 32 points of piercing

1576
01:30:25,617 --> 01:30:30,299
damage. All three bolts stick
into your chest. They're big, long, thick, heavy

1577
01:30:30,299 --> 01:30:35,131
crossbow bolts. One of them gleans off your
shoulder and catches the edge of the wall, but the

1578
01:30:35,131 --> 01:30:39,441
other two have actually sunk into your torso and
are sticking out of you. The other five against

1579
01:30:39,441 --> 01:30:40,380
you, Grog.

1580
01:30:40,380 --> 01:30:41,562
TRAVIS: Yep.

1581
01:30:41,562 --> 01:30:47,270
MATT: Since you did not do reckless strike last
time, they are not with advantage. That is 19?

1582
01:30:47,270 --> 01:30:48,873
TRAVIS: Hits.

1583
01:30:48,873 --> 01:30:50,209
MATT: 12?

1584
01:30:50,209 --> 01:30:51,571
TRAVIS: Misses.

1585
01:30:51,571 --> 01:30:53,406
MATT: Oh, that's a 25.

1586
01:30:53,406 --> 01:30:54,674
TRAVIS: Hits.

1587
01:30:54,674 --> 01:30:56,533
MATT: That is a 19?

1588
01:30:56,533 --> 01:30:57,675
TRAVIS: Hits.

1589
01:30:57,675 --> 01:30:59,619
MATT: Last one is a 24.

1590
01:30:59,619 --> 01:31:01,228
TRAVIS: Yep, so four out of the five.

1591
01:31:01,228 --> 01:31:07,865
MATT: Yep. That's 11 plus seven. 18.

1592
01:31:07,865 --> 01:31:09,932
TRAVIS: 18.

1593
01:31:09,932 --> 01:31:11,650
MATT: Plus eight. 25.

1594
01:31:11,650 --> 01:31:12,930
TRAVIS: 26.

1595
01:31:12,930 --> 01:31:14,913
MATT: Plus 13. So 39.

1596
01:31:14,913 --> 01:31:16,373
TRAVIS: 39. Half.

1597
01:31:16,373 --> 01:31:17,493
MATT: 18.

1598
01:31:17,493 --> 01:31:18,497
TRAVIS: Okay.

1599
01:31:18,497 --> 01:31:22,784
MATT: 18 points of piercing damage again. Bolts
are sticking out of your body all over. You almost

1600
01:31:22,784 --> 01:31:26,380
have additional armor from the number of bolts
that are on your body, but you're still standing

1601
01:31:26,380 --> 01:31:31,728
there, frothing at the mouth, angry, just like,
"Come at me!" That ends the guards' turn. They all

1602
01:31:31,728 --> 01:31:35,730
reload their bolts and pull their crossbows up.
Vex, you're up.

1603
01:31:35,788 --> 01:31:39,654
LAURA: Yay! Can I get up to the doorway? Tell me
that I can.

1604
01:31:39,701 --> 01:31:42,406
MATT: With a dash, you can, yeah.

1605
01:31:42,406 --> 01:31:45,311
LAURA: But I don't get any action, then.

1606
01:31:45,311 --> 01:31:47,347
MATT: Unfortunately, no.

1607
01:31:47,347 --> 01:31:48,701
LAURA: Damn it!

1608
01:31:48,701 --> 01:31:50,073
TRAVIS: Janet.

1609
01:31:50,073 --> 01:31:57,051
LAURA: Damn it, Janet! All right, Trinket's just
going to try to claw him.

1610
01:31:57,051 --> 01:32:00,979
MATT: Okay. Go ahead. Two attacks from Trinket.

1611
01:32:00,979 --> 01:32:02,260
LAURA: Yep.

1612
01:32:02,260 --> 01:32:03,407
LIAM: Make it good.

1613
01:32:03,407 --> 01:32:04,832
SAM: Come on, you're my favorite bear, Trinkie.

1614
01:32:04,832 --> 01:32:06,563
LAURA: That hits him. That definitely hits him.

1615
01:32:06,563 --> 01:32:09,335
LIAM: 16 plus a lot.

1616
01:32:09,335 --> 01:32:10,266
LAURA: Yeah.

1617
01:32:10,266 --> 01:32:12,251
MATT: Oh, yeah, that hits him.

1618
01:32:12,251 --> 01:32:13,558
LAURA and LIAM: A natural 20!

1619
01:32:13,558 --> 01:32:15,177
(cheering)

1620
01:32:15,177 --> 01:32:16,901
TRAVIS: (laughs) Trinket got a natural 20?

1621
01:32:16,901 --> 01:32:20,889
MATT: All right, so damage on the first strike?

1622
01:32:20,889 --> 01:32:22,943
SAM: That was a critical "rawrl."

1623
01:32:22,943 --> 01:32:29,547
LAURA: 11 for the first, and then--

1624
01:32:29,547 --> 01:32:32,256
TRAVIS: So sour it was sweet.

1625
01:32:32,256 --> 01:32:36,940
LIAM: Three plus seven is ten. 20? Which part
doubles?

1626
01:32:36,940 --> 01:32:39,214
LAURA: Just the dice doubles?

1627
01:32:39,214 --> 01:32:40,714
MATT: The dice doubles, yeah.

1628
01:32:40,714 --> 01:32:43,563
LAURA: 13 for the second attack.

1629
01:32:43,563 --> 01:32:46,185
MATT: So a total of 23 damage? All right.

1630
01:32:46,185 --> 01:32:47,211
LAURA: 24 damage.

1631
01:32:47,211 --> 01:32:49,075
MATT: 24 damage. How does Trinket want to do
this?

1632
01:32:49,075 --> 01:32:50,777
(cheering)

1633
01:32:50,777 --> 01:32:52,345
LAURA: He really just killed a vampire?

1634
01:32:52,345 --> 01:32:53,549
LIAM: Is this a first?!

1635
01:32:53,549 --> 01:32:55,471
TALIESIN: This is a first.

1636
01:32:55,471 --> 01:32:57,968
TRAVIS: I think it's Trinket's first kill.

1637
01:32:57,968 --> 01:32:59,606
MARISHA: Trinket!

1638
01:32:59,606 --> 01:33:04,307
LAURA: Trinket claws crosswise and takes off his
head with a bite.

1639
01:33:04,307 --> 01:33:09,931
MATT: Okay. So as Trinket reaches down, (whoosh)
arcing both claws across his back, Tylieri is

1640
01:33:09,931 --> 01:33:16,202
dropped to his hands and knees, looks up as
Trinket then puts his jaws down over the head and

1641
01:33:16,202 --> 01:33:22,564
lifts up. As you see the flesh begin to tear on
his body, he screams out in pain as the body

1642
01:33:22,564 --> 01:33:24,157
(fluttering sound) turns to mist.

1643
01:33:24,157 --> 01:33:26,844
LAURA: Damn it! He's a vampire!

1644
01:33:26,844 --> 01:33:28,676
LIAM: Wait, is the mist there?

1645
01:33:28,676 --> 01:33:31,511
MATT: The mist is there, yeah. There's a clump of
mist where he once was.

1646
01:33:31,511 --> 01:33:33,525
LIAM: Somebody light a match!

1647
01:33:33,525 --> 01:33:34,894
MARISHA: I'm coming!

1648
01:33:34,894 --> 01:33:40,012
LAURA: So the head disappears from his mouth, or
did he still get a big taste?

1649
01:33:40,012 --> 01:33:45,793
MATT: There's still some thick, purplish,
congealed blood in his mouth, but the vampire's

1650
01:33:45,793 --> 01:33:52,743
form has been forced to mist at zero hit points.
All right, that brings us to Keyleth.

1651
01:33:52,743 --> 01:34:02,165
MARISHA: Okay! So seeing Vax go over the table
and being like, "That was cool," I'm also going to

1652
01:34:02,209 --> 01:34:07,167
be like (grunts) over the table. I'm going to join
the Dukes of Hazzard train.

1653
01:34:07,167 --> 01:34:08,865
MATT: Acrobatics check.

1654
01:34:08,865 --> 01:34:12,740
MARISHA: Damn it. That's not bad!

1655
01:34:12,740 --> 01:34:15,242
MATT: It's not a huge difficulty.

1656
01:34:15,242 --> 01:34:16,963
MARISHA: Acrobatics? 17?

1657
01:34:16,963 --> 01:34:21,570
MATT: 17, yeah. You jump up (shh) slide across,
land across. The bonus there is that it takes only

1658
01:34:21,570 --> 01:34:25,314
one block of movement to get across. That's five
foot there.

1659
01:34:25,314 --> 01:34:34,344
MARISHA: So I'm going to come in and I see a
headless dude with mist swirling around him?

1660
01:34:34,344 --> 01:34:39,680
MATT: No, you just see Grog, Vax, and Trinket in
the center of this foyer, with a big cloud of mist

1661
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:45,991
near Trinket and Grog, and an entire array of
guards with heavy crossbows trained down on the

1662
01:34:45,991 --> 01:34:48,397
three of them in this ambush pit.

1663
01:34:48,397 --> 01:34:51,324
SAM: Would she know what it was?

1664
01:34:51,324 --> 01:34:55,145
LAURA: Yeah, you would! We've learned about
vampires. We know they turn into mist.

1665
01:34:55,145 --> 01:34:58,543
LIAM: Yeah, the vampires down by the tree did
this. They misted in.

1666
01:34:58,543 --> 01:34:59,663
TRAVIS: Sunlight that shit.

1667
01:34:59,663 --> 01:35:01,018
LAURA: Sunbeam!

1668
01:35:01,018 --> 01:35:02,945
MARISHA: Someone could yell at me to do it.

1669
01:35:02,945 --> 01:35:04,111
TALIESIN: (shouts) Sunlight!

1670
01:35:04,111 --> 01:35:07,687
MATT: I would say... make an intelligence check.

1671
01:35:07,687 --> 01:35:11,889
MARISHA: Okay. This one.

1672
01:35:11,889 --> 01:35:14,127
SAM: Ooh, that's the intelligent dice.

1673
01:35:14,127 --> 01:35:15,280
TALIESIN: Yes, it is.

1674
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:18,660
MARISHA: Yes, it is. Just with my modifier?

1675
01:35:18,660 --> 01:35:19,533
MATT: Yeah.

1676
01:35:19,533 --> 01:35:23,282
MARISHA: Wait, is this a saving throw? Just my
modifier, so 17.

1677
01:35:23,282 --> 01:35:30,942
MATT: 17. Okay. I'd say, given the circumstance
right now, just rushing in and seeing mist there

1678
01:35:30,942 --> 01:35:35,360
and people with things, you have no idea that's a
vampire, you have no reason to believe that's a

1679
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:39,676
vampire, you just know that right now there is--
I'm just being honest here! You walk in the room

1680
01:35:39,676 --> 01:35:42,211
and there's a little bit of mist on the ground and
there's a bunch of guards up there. It looks like

1681
01:35:42,211 --> 01:35:43,943
there's a threat of a bunch of guards in the
room.

1682
01:35:43,943 --> 01:35:46,298
TRAVIS: Identify it. It's a vampire.

1683
01:35:46,298 --> 01:35:48,143
LAURA: You know it now.

1684
01:35:48,143 --> 01:35:51,276
MATT: (laughs) Grog, in the middle of a frenzied
rage, would not have that--

1685
01:35:51,276 --> 01:35:56,328
TALIESIN: I would have enough to point and say--
oh, for the love of god. Okay, fine.

1686
01:35:56,328 --> 01:35:57,717
MATT: Keyleth, take your turn.

1687
01:35:57,717 --> 01:35:58,795
LAURA: Oh, man.

1688
01:35:58,795 --> 01:36:01,379
MATT: No more metagaming. Take your turn. What do
you want to do?

1689
01:36:01,379 --> 01:36:03,309
TRAVIS: What are you doing?

1690
01:36:03,309 --> 01:36:08,313
MARISHA: Well, I know what I want to do, but I
can't do it without feeling guilty! I was going to

1691
01:36:08,313 --> 01:36:09,822
Sunbeam this bitch.

1692
01:36:09,822 --> 01:36:12,292
MATT: It only makes sense. I'm just saying.

1693
01:36:12,292 --> 01:36:14,628
MARISHA: What makes sense? That I wouldn't know?

1694
01:36:14,628 --> 01:36:17,397
MATT: That you wouldn't know that that little bit
of mist on the ground there is a vampire. There's

1695
01:36:17,397 --> 01:36:19,098
no way that Keyleth would know that based on the
way you--

1696
01:36:19,098 --> 01:36:20,407
LIAM: Just missed it.

1697
01:36:20,407 --> 01:36:21,826
MATT: Yeah, you just missed it.

1698
01:36:21,826 --> 01:36:23,056
MARISHA: I would just see a black mist?

1699
01:36:23,056 --> 01:36:24,177
MATT: It's just a mist.

1700
01:36:24,177 --> 01:36:25,669
TRAVIS: We've got a ton of other people in the
room, though.

1701
01:36:25,669 --> 01:36:27,472
MATT: And there's black smoke around one of the
guards up there.

1702
01:36:27,472 --> 01:36:40,222
MARISHA: Well, if I saw a black mist, what I would
probably do, realistically, is think it was some

1703
01:36:40,222 --> 01:36:47,724
sort of poison shit and I would Wind Wall it. So
I'm going to (goosh) Wind Wall that mist.

1704
01:36:47,724 --> 01:36:54,106
MATT: Okay. All righty. Let's see. (laughs) This
should actually be pretty interesting.

1705
01:36:54,106 --> 01:37:00,715
MARISHA: (weakly) It's what I would assume it was,
but I might be aiding it in getting away.

1706
01:37:00,715 --> 01:37:03,614
MATT: All right.

1707
01:37:03,614 --> 01:37:05,861
MARISHA: This is bullshit.

1708
01:37:05,861 --> 01:37:11,150
MATT: All right, so. You put a Wind Wall up
(fwoosh) in this area. You can see the mist

1709
01:37:11,150 --> 01:37:15,762
dissipates for a second and holds its place.
However, this Wind Wall is now currently held up

1710
01:37:15,762 --> 01:37:18,707
in this area. That's your action.

1711
01:37:18,707 --> 01:37:23,862
MARISHA: I Wind Wall it to keep, essentially do
the Wind Wall--

1712
01:37:23,862 --> 01:37:24,830
MATT: Here?

1713
01:37:24,830 --> 01:37:26,113
MARISHA: Yeah, around Grog.

1714
01:37:26,113 --> 01:37:27,275
MATT: Right at this area?

1715
01:37:27,275 --> 01:37:29,102
MARISHA: Yeah, I'd want to protect him from the
crossbows.

1716
01:37:29,102 --> 01:37:33,435
MATT: Okay. So there's just wind rushing up
around. You can see the tapestries on the walls

1717
01:37:33,435 --> 01:37:34,902
are flickering around.

1718
01:37:34,902 --> 01:37:38,437
MARISHA: And then I once again go, "Scanlan!
Scanlan!"

1719
01:37:38,437 --> 01:37:46,453
MATT: There's a little bit of crackling through.
You're right at the cusp of the distance on these

1720
01:37:46,453 --> 01:37:52,048
communicators. Scanlan, you hear bits and pieces.
At this point in time right now, you're--

1721
01:37:52,048 --> 01:37:53,822
SAM: I'm on the roof?

1722
01:37:53,822 --> 01:37:57,431
MATT: You're hearing crackling in your ear, but
you're still on the roof doing the chaos, so you

1723
01:37:57,431 --> 01:38:00,119
haven't heard anything really coming through, at
this point.

1724
01:38:00,119 --> 01:38:01,574
LAURA: "Doing the chaos."

1725
01:38:01,574 --> 01:38:02,768
MATT: You're going to stay right there?

1726
01:38:02,768 --> 01:38:03,863
SAM: I'm doing this thing.

1727
01:38:03,863 --> 01:38:05,402
MATT: Yeah, you're trust-falling off the roof.

1728
01:38:05,402 --> 01:38:08,504
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm going to back into the corner
and keep this Wind Wall up.

1729
01:38:08,504 --> 01:38:11,442
MATT: Okay, just concentrating on the Wind Wall.
That brings us up to Percy.

1730
01:38:11,442 --> 01:38:18,006
TALIESIN: I take my next shot at the next crossbow
bugger.

1731
01:38:18,006 --> 01:38:19,658
MATT: Go for it.

1732
01:38:19,658 --> 01:38:22,898
TALIESIN: That's 15?

1733
01:38:22,898 --> 01:38:25,781
MATT: 15? Just misses.

1734
01:38:25,820 --> 01:38:27,087
TALIESIN: God damn it.

1735
01:38:27,087 --> 01:38:29,651
MATT: It hits the armor and it (ricochet noise)
ricochets off.

1736
01:38:29,651 --> 01:38:34,605
MARISHA: So am I encapsulating the mist in my Wind
Wall? I'm kind of trapping the mist in?

1737
01:38:34,605 --> 01:38:39,505
MATT: The Wind Wall itself is not a full circle,
it's just a semi-circle.

1738
01:38:39,505 --> 01:38:41,837
MARISHA: A half-circle, yeah, but is it stuck in
the wall?

1739
01:38:41,837 --> 01:38:44,265
MATT: It's currently overlapped with it, yeah.

1740
01:38:44,265 --> 01:38:45,771
MARISHA: Okay.

1741
01:38:45,771 --> 01:38:47,912
TALIESIN: That's 22.

1742
01:38:47,912 --> 01:38:49,675
MATT: 22 to hit?

1743
01:38:49,675 --> 01:38:50,579
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1744
01:38:50,579 --> 01:38:51,504
MATT: Hits.

1745
01:38:51,504 --> 01:38:59,759
TALIESIN: It hit. That's 18 points of damage.

1746
01:38:59,759 --> 01:39:02,923
MATT: All righty. And you have your third attack.

1747
01:39:02,923 --> 01:39:08,263
TALIESIN: My third attack, also on him, is also
22.

1748
01:39:08,263 --> 01:39:09,791
MATT: That hits, as well.

1749
01:39:09,791 --> 01:39:18,947
TALIESIN: And that's-- ooh, that sucks. Two points
of ice damage plus 11 points of normal damage.

1750
01:39:18,947 --> 01:39:22,773
MATT: 13 total. Okay. So (doosh) the last two
blasts hit him, and you can see, he almost gets

1751
01:39:22,773 --> 01:39:28,087
thrown off his feet from the impact. There's now
blood trickling out from under his helmet from

1752
01:39:28,135 --> 01:39:32,340
where one of the blasts got his chin. One into his
chest. He's still standing up, barely, and he's

1753
01:39:32,340 --> 01:39:37,820
still confused by this smoke that's swirling
around him. Are you going to stay where you are?

1754
01:39:37,820 --> 01:39:42,591
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a step forward.

1755
01:39:42,591 --> 01:39:44,324
MATT: Right there?

1756
01:39:44,324 --> 01:39:45,504
TALIESIN: Up the stairs.

1757
01:39:45,504 --> 01:39:47,063
MATT: Up the stairs. Okay.

1758
01:39:47,063 --> 01:39:48,240
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1759
01:39:48,240 --> 01:39:52,957
MATT: Just ominously stepping up the stairway. I
like it. That brings us to Vax.

1760
01:39:52,957 --> 01:40:01,910
LIAM: Right, so I'm going to start rushing up the
stairs. Before I do, I'm going to spank Grog as

1761
01:40:01,910 --> 01:40:07,001
hard as I can on the ass and say, "Kill!" And run
up the stairs at the first guy who's enveloped in

1762
01:40:07,001 --> 01:40:08,877
Percy's smoke and start stabbing him.

1763
01:40:08,877 --> 01:40:12,468
MATT: Okay. He's up above the banister, so you
probably have to--

1764
01:40:12,468 --> 01:40:14,125
LIAM: There's no balcony?

1765
01:40:14,125 --> 01:40:19,270
MATT: No, the idea is the banister rides up and
there's a wall along it, and then they're all up

1766
01:40:19,270 --> 01:40:23,150
on the second floor here looking down at this.

1767
01:40:23,150 --> 01:40:24,852
LIAM: So there's no way up there?

1768
01:40:24,852 --> 01:40:26,759
MATT: You could leap up. Make an acrobatics check
to leap up and over the banister.

1769
01:40:26,759 --> 01:40:31,470
LIAM: That's what I'll do. Yeah, that's good.
That's 30.

1770
01:40:31,470 --> 01:40:36,845
MATT: Yeah, you jump, grab it, flip over, land on
the balcony next to the guy enveloped in smoke.

1771
01:40:36,845 --> 01:40:38,714
LIAM: And I stab him.

1772
01:40:38,714 --> 01:40:40,106
MATT: Go for it.

1773
01:40:40,106 --> 01:40:46,833
LIAM: Okay. Did the leaping take any of my
actions? It's movement?

1774
01:40:46,833 --> 01:40:48,525
MATT: No, it's part of your movement.

1775
01:40:48,525 --> 01:40:49,911
LIAM: Okay, so that's 22.

1776
01:40:49,911 --> 01:40:50,923
MATT: 22 hits.

1777
01:40:50,923 --> 01:40:55,402
LIAM: And a 16. And a one.

1778
01:40:55,402 --> 01:40:57,157
MATT: First two hit.

1779
01:40:57,157 --> 01:41:05,373
LIAM: Yeah, okay. The first one is the Flametongue
dagger. That is four plus six is ten. And the

1780
01:41:05,373 --> 01:41:09,344
second one is the keen dagger, and that is two
plus seven is nine.

1781
01:41:09,344 --> 01:41:13,442
MATT: All right. As you rush up, the guard looking
at you, confused, the smoke swirling around him.

1782
01:41:13,442 --> 01:41:19,032
(stabbing sounds) As the first two daggers stab
in, the second one actually finds between his ribs

1783
01:41:19,032 --> 01:41:24,591
up to where his heart is, and you see him gasp for
a second as he crumples beneath your grip, and you

1784
01:41:24,591 --> 01:41:26,675
slide the blade out as he crumples to the ground.

1785
01:41:26,675 --> 01:41:28,377
LIAM: That's the button.

1786
01:41:28,377 --> 01:41:36,169
MATT: (laughs) That is the dead button. All right.
That ends your turn. Tylieri--

1787
01:41:36,169 --> 01:41:37,953
SAM: Wait, he's still alive?

1788
01:41:37,953 --> 01:41:39,417
LAURA: He's a mist.

1789
01:41:39,417 --> 01:41:45,043
MATT: All right, the mist pushes past. He's going
to use some action to move.

1790
01:41:45,043 --> 01:41:51,066
LAURA: He pushes past the Wind Wall? But it says
that figures caught in a gaseous form can't pass

1791
01:41:51,066 --> 01:41:53,537
through the Wind Wall. In the spell.

1792
01:41:53,537 --> 01:41:55,285
MARISHA: That it does.

1793
01:41:55,285 --> 01:41:56,450
LAURA: I just read it.

1794
01:41:56,450 --> 01:41:58,718
MARISHA: That's my motherfucking Wind Wall!

1795
01:41:58,718 --> 01:42:03,713
LAURA: So it's going to screw up my arrows, so I
was checking in. But yeah, it also says,

1796
01:42:03,713 --> 01:42:07,185
"creatures in gaseous form can't pass through
it."

1797
01:42:07,185 --> 01:42:11,206
SAM: Why would they even have a hypothetical for
that?

1798
01:42:11,206 --> 01:42:13,354
LIAM, MARISHA, and TALIESIN: Because of this!

1799
01:42:13,354 --> 01:42:15,337
TALIESIN: Because of the things right here.

1800
01:42:15,337 --> 01:42:17,082
MARISHA: It's coming in handy.

1801
01:42:17,082 --> 01:42:18,845
LIAM: Thanks, Mike Mearls!

1802
01:42:18,845 --> 01:42:23,557
MATT: However, as part of that, then Trinket is
also in the Wind Wall, as well, just as a note. So

1803
01:42:23,557 --> 01:42:29,708
Trinket will be taking bludgeoning damage for
being within it. So just as a heads-up. In fact,

1804
01:42:29,708 --> 01:42:32,460
right now, have Trinket make a strength saving
throw.

1805
01:42:32,460 --> 01:42:33,466
MARISHA: Sorry.

1806
01:42:33,466 --> 01:42:34,846
LAURA: It's okay.

1807
01:42:34,846 --> 01:42:36,854
SAM: Is it like a hurricane or something?

1808
01:42:36,854 --> 01:42:38,671
MARISHA: It's a wall of wind.

1809
01:42:38,671 --> 01:42:39,930
LAURA: Eight?

1810
01:42:39,930 --> 01:42:42,934
MATT: Okay. Trinket takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage.

1811
01:42:42,934 --> 01:42:44,871
MARISHA: How much?

1812
01:42:44,871 --> 01:42:46,374
MATT: Go ahead and roll 3d8.

1813
01:42:46,374 --> 01:42:48,041
LIAM: 3d8. Up to 24.

1814
01:42:48,041 --> 01:42:49,143
SAM: Whoa.

1815
01:42:49,143 --> 01:42:51,069
MATT: Yeah. I thought you were capturing him
inside. I didn't realize you had it actually on

1816
01:42:51,069 --> 01:42:55,960
him, and so having the Wind Wall on him to prevent
him from moving would also have Trinket in it, yeah.

1817
01:42:55,960 --> 01:43:00,467
MARISHA: It could be worse. That's six plus four,
so ten.

1818
01:43:00,467 --> 01:43:02,414
LIAM: He's had worse. He'll be fine.

1819
01:43:02,414 --> 01:43:03,964
LAURA: Yeah. Okay.

1820
01:43:03,964 --> 01:43:16,756
MATT: All right, so that will make it actually
more here. So Tylieri cannot break through.

1821
01:43:16,756 --> 01:43:20,841
Tylieri stays there in mist form, being caught in
the whirlwind. Grog, you're up.

1822
01:43:20,841 --> 01:43:22,102
TRAVIS: I'm up?

1823
01:43:22,102 --> 01:43:23,208
MATT: Yep.

1824
01:43:23,208 --> 01:43:26,554
TRAVIS: Well, I can't get through the-- I mean, I
don't know what the fuck--

1825
01:43:26,554 --> 01:43:27,838
MARISHA: You can get through the Wind Wall.

1826
01:43:27,838 --> 01:43:32,386
TRAVIS: What am I going to do to gas? Hit it? Can
I start running up the motherfucking stairs and

1827
01:43:32,386 --> 01:43:34,641
jump up like Vax did? He said to kill!

1828
01:43:34,641 --> 01:43:43,850
MATT: All right, yeah. You can get up to there,
and you're just within reach to get one guy over

1829
01:43:43,850 --> 01:43:45,334
the banister, probably.

1830
01:43:45,334 --> 01:43:49,715
TRAVIS: Yeah! I'd like to do that. That's a 23.

1831
01:43:49,715 --> 01:43:51,980
MATT: That hits. More attacks?

1832
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:54,810
TRAVIS: Yes. Oh, how many attacks do I get?

1833
01:43:54,810 --> 01:43:56,227
MATT: All of them. That was just your movement.

1834
01:43:56,227 --> 01:43:57,974
TRAVIS: Yay, I get all of them?! That's amazing.

1835
01:43:57,974 --> 01:43:59,428
MATT: Your barbarian 40 feet of crazy movement.

1836
01:43:59,428 --> 01:44:01,156
TRAVIS: Yay! 22!

1837
01:44:01,156 --> 01:44:02,639
MATT: Yep.

1838
01:44:02,639 --> 01:44:05,437
TRAVIS: Shit! 12.

1839
01:44:05,437 --> 01:44:06,962
MATT: 12 does not hit.

1840
01:44:06,962 --> 01:44:08,246
TRAVIS: (laughing) Okay.

1841
01:44:08,246 --> 01:44:10,003
MATT: (laughs) The first two hit.

1842
01:44:10,003 --> 01:44:14,744
TRAVIS: 13. 17 for the first one.

1843
01:44:14,744 --> 01:44:16,521
MATT: All right, 17 damage.

1844
01:44:16,521 --> 01:44:23,193
TRAVIS: 15, and 17 again. Two plus two.

1845
01:44:23,193 --> 01:44:28,456
MATT: Nice. All right, so (whack) the hammer comes
streaking down, slamming into the guard there. His

1846
01:44:28,456 --> 01:44:32,216
crossbow shatters from the impact and the flames
begin to lick up the front of his body. The second

1847
01:44:32,216 --> 01:44:36,256
slam smacks him again. This time, you hear the
armor ring out from the metal-on-metal impact. He

1848
01:44:36,256 --> 01:44:40,267
kind of shakes from it. The third time you're just
in the middle of this series of swinging and he

1849
01:44:40,267 --> 01:44:43,811
backs up, and you end up smashing the banister
instead of him, the hammer cracking part of the

1850
01:44:43,811 --> 01:44:49,995
ground on the second floor. He looks pretty messed
up from that series of attacks. All right, that

1851
01:44:49,995 --> 01:44:54,144
ends your turn, Grog. It's now the guards' turn.

1852
01:44:54,144 --> 01:44:55,670
TRAVIS: Come at me, bro.

1853
01:44:55,670 --> 01:45:01,412
MATT: This guard's going to move over here.
They're all like, "Oh god." These three here are

1854
01:45:01,412 --> 01:45:05,390
going to attempt to fire on Trinket through the
Wind Wall. These two are going to fire at you,

1855
01:45:05,390 --> 01:45:11,940
Grog, and these two are going to longsword you.
They pull out their longswords. This one's going

1856
01:45:11,940 --> 01:45:17,010
to turn with his crossbow and fire at you, Vax. So
first is the attack at you with the crossbow. That

1857
01:45:17,010 --> 01:45:18,188
is a 20?

1858
01:45:18,188 --> 01:45:19,623
LIAM: Oh, yeah, that hits.

1859
01:45:19,623 --> 01:45:24,548
MATT: You take-- ooh, that's a ten-- 13 points of
piercing damage as the bolt strikes you right in

1860
01:45:24,548 --> 01:45:29,045
the chest, cracking your sternum a little bit.
You're like, (groans) that's going to suck. You

1861
01:45:29,045 --> 01:45:34,223
feel the scraping of the bone as it impacts. The
two with the longswords against you, Grog.

1862
01:45:34,223 --> 01:45:35,619
TRAVIS: Yep.

1863
01:45:35,619 --> 01:45:37,479
MATT: That is 18?

1864
01:45:37,479 --> 01:45:38,664
TRAVIS: Misses.

1865
01:45:38,664 --> 01:45:40,391
MATT: That is a 12.

1866
01:45:40,391 --> 01:45:41,580
TRAVIS: Misses!

1867
01:45:41,580 --> 01:45:46,572
MATT: Both of the blades come at you. One of them
actually hits your shoulder, but it just sticks an

1868
01:45:46,572 --> 01:45:50,822
inch into the flesh, and you just flex and the
blade pops out. The second one swings out and you

1869
01:45:50,822 --> 01:45:54,368
duck your head out of the way and it (whoosh) goes
long and you just grin through the anger. That's

1870
01:45:54,368 --> 01:46:02,385
awesome. Then these two are going to fire
crossbows at you, Grog. That is going to be a 15?

1871
01:46:02,385 --> 01:46:03,718
TRAVIS: Misses.

1872
01:46:03,718 --> 01:46:05,177
MATT: And a 23.

1873
01:46:05,177 --> 01:46:07,687
TRAVIS: Damn, I was almost Neo, just dodging all
sorts of shit.

1874
01:46:07,687 --> 01:46:10,499
MATT: Another ten. 13 points of piercing damage.

1875
01:46:10,499 --> 01:46:11,968
TRAVIS: Halved to seven?

1876
01:46:11,968 --> 01:46:16,209
MATT: Half that to seven, yeah. And then now the
three aiming at Trinket. They all have

1877
01:46:16,209 --> 01:46:17,965
disadvantage, I believe?

1878
01:46:17,965 --> 01:46:19,753
LAURA: Nothing can shoot through the Wind Wall.

1879
01:46:19,753 --> 01:46:20,945
MATT: Nothing can shoot through it at all?

1880
01:46:20,945 --> 01:46:22,581
LAURA: Arrows can't go through it, it said.

1881
01:46:22,581 --> 01:46:23,628
MATT: At all?!

1882
01:46:23,628 --> 01:46:24,698
TRAVIS: She said begrudgingly.

1883
01:46:24,698 --> 01:46:26,104
LAURA: Which fucking sucks.

1884
01:46:26,104 --> 01:46:31,678
MARISHA: Well, I mean, it's going to save a bear,
right? After I punched him with the wind.

1885
01:46:31,678 --> 01:46:33,526
SAM: Yeah, and also kill the bear.

1886
01:46:33,526 --> 01:46:37,617
MATT: Yeah, they automatically miss. They all
three fire through. All bolts just (shhh) get

1887
01:46:37,617 --> 01:46:39,997
scattered across the room.

1888
01:46:40,038 --> 01:46:41,629
LAURA: Yeah, it goes straight up to the roof, it
says.

1889
01:46:41,629 --> 01:46:42,645
MATT: Wind Wall. That's awesome.

1890
01:46:42,645 --> 01:46:45,587
LAURA: Does the Wind Wall go all the way up to the
ceiling, or does it go to a certain height?

1891
01:46:45,587 --> 01:46:46,870
MARISHA: 15 foot high.

1892
01:46:46,870 --> 01:46:51,243
MATT: 50 feet long, 15 feet high. So it doesn't go
all the way to the ceiling. In fact, it gets just

1893
01:46:51,243 --> 01:46:55,813
a little bit past the second floor, so it's about
the height of the guys on the second platform.

1894
01:46:55,813 --> 01:46:59,411
That ends their turn. Vex, you're up.

1895
01:46:59,411 --> 01:47:02,438
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to tell Trinket to get out
of the Wind Wall.

1896
01:47:02,438 --> 01:47:04,287
MATT: Okay.

1897
01:47:04,287 --> 01:47:06,071
SAM: The Wind Wall gets an attack of opportunity.

1898
01:47:06,071 --> 01:47:07,386
(laughter)

1899
01:47:07,386 --> 01:47:09,067
LAURA: Well, he's going to move.

1900
01:47:09,067 --> 01:47:10,350
MATT: He goes to the front door.

1901
01:47:10,350 --> 01:47:12,790
LAURA: And he's going to be very happy to see me
come around the corner of that door.

1902
01:47:12,790 --> 01:47:13,907
MATT: All right.

1903
01:47:13,907 --> 01:47:19,557
LAURA: Where I will see a bunch of dudes up high,
and I want to try to do Conjure Barrage up and

1904
01:47:19,557 --> 01:47:24,186
over the Wind Wall and in an arc downward on
everybody on the other side of it.

1905
01:47:24,186 --> 01:47:25,474
MATT: Interesting. Okay.

1906
01:47:25,474 --> 01:47:29,910
LAURA: It's like a (whoo, boom).

1907
01:47:29,910 --> 01:47:31,357
TRAVIS: A half-pull.

1908
01:47:31,357 --> 01:47:35,114
MATT: Yeah, which at this short distance, is not a
lot of strength to get the lob.

1909
01:47:35,273 --> 01:47:38,278
LAURA: I'm a really skilled archer. I'm kind of
like Legolas.

1910
01:47:38,278 --> 01:47:42,134
MATT: But if you're shooting up this way? The Wind
Wall itself only really encompasses the bottom of

1911
01:47:42,134 --> 01:47:45,449
the foyer, so if you go up the stairs a little
bit, you will be able to get these guys here.

1912
01:47:45,449 --> 01:47:46,597
LAURA: Can I get up there?

1913
01:47:46,597 --> 01:47:47,526
MATT: Yeah.

1914
01:47:47,526 --> 01:47:50,148
LAURA: Oh, yeah! Fuck yeah, I'll do it and try to
get everybody in that cone. Sorry, guys.

1915
01:47:50,148 --> 01:47:51,293
TRAVIS: Nope. Make it rain.

1916
01:47:51,293 --> 01:47:53,976
MATT: Yeah, you're going to hit all of them.

1917
01:47:53,976 --> 01:47:55,973
TRAVIS: Just go for it. I'm a fan of one-dollar
bills.

1918
01:47:55,973 --> 01:47:57,408
LIAM: I can take it.

1919
01:47:57,408 --> 01:48:03,379
LAURA: Okay. Wait, I've got to see how this works.
I just throw it in the air and it turns into a cone.

1920
01:48:03,379 --> 01:48:04,694
MATT: Yep.

1921
01:48:04,694 --> 01:48:06,311
LAURA: So I don't have to attack?

1922
01:48:06,311 --> 01:48:09,350
MATT: They should have a saving throw, I believe,
right?

1923
01:48:09,350 --> 01:48:11,163
LAURA: Yeah, they have a dexterity saving throw.

1924
01:48:11,163 --> 01:48:13,807
MATT: Everyone make a dexterity saving throw. Or
at least you two.

1925
01:48:13,807 --> 01:48:14,754
LIAM: Yeah.

1926
01:48:14,754 --> 01:48:16,386
TRAVIS: Do I have advantage-- I don't know.

1927
01:48:16,386 --> 01:48:18,052
LAURA: I'm casting this as a 3rd-level.

1928
01:48:18,052 --> 01:48:21,201
MATT: One guy makes the saving throw.

1929
01:48:21,201 --> 01:48:23,760
LIAM: 25.

1930
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:25,062
TRAVIS: 20.

1931
01:48:25,062 --> 01:48:30,938
MATT: You all succeed. One of the villains makes
it, and they both make it. Is it half-damage,

1932
01:48:30,938 --> 01:48:31,905
right?

1933
01:48:31,905 --> 01:48:33,867
LAURA: What about all those guys up at the top?

1934
01:48:33,917 --> 01:48:35,597
MATT: That's what I'm saying. This guy made it,
these two didn't.

1935
01:48:35,597 --> 01:48:37,061
LAURA: What about the other ones?

1936
01:48:37,061 --> 01:48:40,220
MATT: Are you doing it from this perspective?
These will go through the Wind Wall, so the Wind

1937
01:48:40,220 --> 01:48:43,626
Wall itself will prevent it from getting to
either. This guy will probably be hit, actually.

1938
01:48:43,626 --> 01:48:44,904
LAURA: Okay.

1939
01:48:44,904 --> 01:48:50,781
MATT: He fails. So yeah, these guys are unaffected
because the Wind Wall prevents the barrage from

1940
01:48:50,781 --> 01:48:53,318
that point. So just go ahead and roll damage.

1941
01:48:53,318 --> 01:48:55,587
LAURA: So I can't get a critical hit on this
because I don't have to roll?

1942
01:48:55,587 --> 01:48:56,839
MATT: Correct.

1943
01:48:56,839 --> 01:48:58,431
TRAVIS: That's good.

1944
01:48:58,431 --> 01:49:02,774
LAURA: 16, am I right? 16. Okay.

1945
01:49:02,774 --> 01:49:03,781
MATT: 16 damage?

1946
01:49:03,781 --> 01:49:04,548
LAURA: Yeah.

1947
01:49:04,548 --> 01:49:05,944
MATT: All right, so it's half that for saves,
right?

1948
01:49:05,944 --> 01:49:06,572
LAURA: Yeah.

1949
01:49:06,572 --> 01:49:08,367
MATT: All right, so eight damage, four damage.

1950
01:49:08,367 --> 01:49:10,264
LIAM: Oh, uncanny dodge.

1951
01:49:10,264 --> 01:49:11,362
MATT: Okay.

1952
01:49:11,362 --> 01:49:17,581
LIAM: Half that. So what did you give me for
damage?

1953
01:49:17,581 --> 01:49:20,039
TALIESIN: You had eight.

1954
01:49:20,039 --> 01:49:21,312
LIAM: Eight? That's four.

1955
01:49:21,312 --> 01:49:28,263
LAURA: And then as a bonus action, I'm going to
Hunter's Mark. Who looks the strongest?

1956
01:49:28,263 --> 01:49:29,384
TRAVIS: Me.

1957
01:49:29,384 --> 01:49:30,624
LAURA: Not you.

1958
01:49:30,624 --> 01:49:34,293
MATT: (laughs) They're all pretty standard.
There's one dude over here that appears to be

1959
01:49:34,293 --> 01:49:35,321
commanding them.

1960
01:49:35,321 --> 01:49:36,786
LAURA: Yeah, I want to hit him!

1961
01:49:36,786 --> 01:49:45,044
MATT: Okay, you Hunter's Mark him. All righty. He
is Hunter's Marked. All righty. By the way, the

1962
01:49:45,044 --> 01:49:49,667
guy that Grog had slammed? The barrage (arrow
impact) riddles him with arrows and he falls over

1963
01:49:49,667 --> 01:49:54,021
and is like (gasps) and crumples to the ground.
The last bit of health that he had.

1964
01:49:54,021 --> 01:49:56,010
TRAVIS: You took away my playmate!

1965
01:49:56,010 --> 01:49:58,610
MATT: Vex, that's the end of your turn. Keyleth,
you're up.

1966
01:49:58,610 --> 01:50:04,998
MARISHA: Okay. So I'm going to keep maintaining
this Wind Wall and wrap it up around the mist to

1967
01:50:04,998 --> 01:50:09,195
double-enforce it, and I'm going to scream, "What
is this?"

1968
01:50:09,195 --> 01:50:11,921
LAURA: I don't know!

1969
01:50:11,921 --> 01:50:14,414
MATT: All right, and then what are you doing?

1970
01:50:14,414 --> 01:50:19,592
TALIESIN: "It's a vampire!" I'm putting my gun
away, anyway.

1971
01:50:19,592 --> 01:50:21,055
MATT: Okay.

1972
01:50:21,055 --> 01:50:23,002
MARISHA: Does that count?

1973
01:50:23,002 --> 01:50:28,189
LIAM: It's a vampire. We just killed him. Sort
of.

1974
01:50:28,189 --> 01:50:32,806
MATT: Be warned: treading thin ice with metagaming
with your DM going forward, but yes. You have now

1975
01:50:32,806 --> 01:50:33,919
heard it from Percy.

1976
01:50:33,919 --> 01:50:36,379
MARISHA: I'm not metagaming! I'm legitimately
asking whether this counts!

1977
01:50:36,379 --> 01:50:40,414
MATT: I know. That's fine. This counts, it's fine.
You heard Percy say, "Vampire!"

1978
01:50:40,414 --> 01:50:42,479
TALIESIN AND LAURA: Vampire!

1979
01:50:42,479 --> 01:50:46,391
MARISHA: (weakly) Oh! Great!

1980
01:50:46,391 --> 01:50:51,735
TALIESIN: What's that charisma score, again? Where
is it?

1981
01:50:51,735 --> 01:50:53,409
SAM: And we fade to black.

1982
01:50:53,409 --> 01:50:56,500
LAURA: Drop your fucking Wind Wall so I can hit
something!

1983
01:50:56,500 --> 01:51:04,692
MARISHA: I'll drop the Wind Wall and cast Sunbeam
and, eyes flashing, light just (goom), right in

1984
01:51:04,692 --> 01:51:09,415
the concentrated beam where I have this mist
there.

1985
01:51:09,415 --> 01:51:10,681
MATT: Okay.

1986
01:51:10,681 --> 01:51:11,804
LIAM: And stuff.

1987
01:51:11,804 --> 01:51:13,369
MARISHA: And stuff.

1988
01:51:13,369 --> 01:51:21,969
MATT: Okay. Yeah, that will be considered direct
sunlight. As you release the Wind Wall, the mist

1989
01:51:21,969 --> 01:51:25,908
immediately begins to push its way this way out of
the room. However, you catch it, your eyes glow,

1990
01:51:25,908 --> 01:51:31,683
and as you release your hand forward, a blast of
pure sun energy shoots forth from your hands. You

1991
01:51:31,683 --> 01:51:36,990
see it burning the back wall like a big, thick
laser, and as the mist tries to escape, you catch

1992
01:51:36,990 --> 01:51:42,337
up to it, and you hear this faint, echoing,
screeching cry as the mist immediately is

1993
01:51:42,337 --> 01:51:45,411
evaporated on impact. (explosion noise)

1994
01:51:45,411 --> 01:51:47,515
LAURA: Can we loot the mist?

1995
01:51:47,515 --> 01:51:51,013
TRAVIS: (laughs) "Can we loot the mist?"

1996
01:51:51,013 --> 01:51:53,186
MATT: You can fill a pocket with ash, if you
like.

1997
01:51:53,186 --> 01:51:55,482
TRAVIS: Come on, at least some coins falling?

1998
01:51:55,482 --> 01:51:59,652
LAURA: (ding ding ding) Like Scott Pilgrim? Oh,
look! Coins. (laughs)

1999
01:51:59,652 --> 01:52:01,142
MARISHA: That's my turn.

2000
01:52:01,142 --> 01:52:02,314
MATT: All righty.

2001
01:52:02,314 --> 01:52:06,241
SAM: Wait, can you use your bonus action to wink
at Matt to ask for forgiveness?

2002
01:52:06,241 --> 01:52:09,672
MARISHA: Why do <i>I</i> have to ask for forgiveness?!

2003
01:52:09,672 --> 01:52:11,108
MATT: Percy, you're up.

2004
01:52:11,108 --> 01:52:14,231
MARISHA: I can use my bonus action to heal
somebody, if someone wants it. Actually, how about

2005
01:52:14,231 --> 01:52:17,674
this? I used my bonus action to ask what the shit
was this.

2006
01:52:17,674 --> 01:52:18,779
MATT: There you go.

2007
01:52:18,779 --> 01:52:20,050
MARISHA: Does that make you feel better?

2008
01:52:20,050 --> 01:52:21,006
MATT: Sure.

2009
01:52:21,006 --> 01:52:23,138
TALIESIN: What's the damage on my rapier, again?
Was it 1d10 plus--

2010
01:52:23,138 --> 01:52:29,515
MATT: 1d8. It's a plus-one rapier, so it's 1d8
plus your dexterity modifier, plus one, so it

2011
01:52:29,515 --> 01:52:32,402
would be plus seven for you.

2012
01:52:32,402 --> 01:52:39,683
TALIESIN: Okay. Then in that case, I'm going to
bring my Hex up to the very next--

2013
01:52:39,683 --> 01:52:41,178
MATT: Right there?

2014
01:52:41,178 --> 01:52:45,275
TALIESIN: And I'm going to put my gun away,
walk up to him, and begin stabbing.

2015
01:52:45,324 --> 01:52:49,702
MATT: All right. One, two, three, four, five. At
that height you're going to have to leap up onto

2016
01:52:49,702 --> 01:52:51,111
the second floor to get to him.

2017
01:52:51,111 --> 01:52:52,504
TALIESIN: Oh, that's right.

2018
01:52:52,504 --> 01:52:54,444
MATT: Yeah, so go ahead and make an acrobatics
check, if you want.

2019
01:52:54,444 --> 01:52:58,563
TALIESIN: I'm just going to walk up, not quite
that close, but one step back.

2020
01:52:58,563 --> 01:53:00,030
MATT: Okay, so there?

2021
01:53:00,030 --> 01:53:01,184
TALIESIN: Take my next three shots.

2022
01:53:01,184 --> 01:53:03,545
MATT: Walk up the stairs. Go for it.

2023
01:53:03,545 --> 01:53:06,491
TALIESIN: That's 21.

2024
01:53:06,491 --> 01:53:07,849
MATT: Hits.

2025
01:53:07,849 --> 01:53:11,130
TALIESIN: That's 23.

2026
01:53:11,130 --> 01:53:12,668
MATT: Hits.

2027
01:53:12,668 --> 01:53:14,373
TALIESIN: I'm going to stop there in case that
kills him.

2028
01:53:14,373 --> 01:53:16,923
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll damage.

2029
01:53:16,923 --> 01:53:18,805
TALIESIN: Actually, I had to reload anyway.

2030
01:53:18,805 --> 01:53:21,108
MATT: So there you go. So your third attack is to
reload.

2031
01:53:21,108 --> 01:53:22,930
TALIESIN: All three was reload, attack, attack.

2032
01:53:22,930 --> 01:53:23,954
MATT: Okay.

2033
01:53:23,954 --> 01:53:29,170
TALIESIN: So that's 16.

2034
01:53:29,170 --> 01:53:31,459
MATT: 16. All righty.

2035
01:53:31,459 --> 01:53:34,751
TALIESIN: 14.

2036
01:53:34,751 --> 01:53:44,819
MATT: (gunshot) He is blasted out of place. You
can see there's a gaping hole across where one of

2037
01:53:44,819 --> 01:53:48,560
his lungs was located, and he (groans) crumples to
the ground into a pile.

2038
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:51,056
TALIESIN: Okay, I move the mist to the next guy.

2039
01:53:51,056 --> 01:54:03,179
MATT: All righty. You use a bonus action to
re-curse him, by the way.

2040
01:54:03,179 --> 01:54:06,034
TALIESIN: I had a bonus action, so I just used
it.

2041
01:54:06,034 --> 01:54:11,403
MATT: That's right, you do. Technically, you used
the bonus action this turn to put it onto him from

2042
01:54:11,403 --> 01:54:12,441
the last turn.

2043
01:54:12,441 --> 01:54:15,655
TALIESIN: Did I? You're technically correct, so go
ahead.

2044
01:54:15,655 --> 01:54:18,097
MATT: You're probably going to do it on your next
turn, anyway, so we'll just leave it there. It's

2045
01:54:18,097 --> 01:54:20,412
fine. But keep that in mind, as this is a new
ability.

2046
01:54:20,412 --> 01:54:21,470
LIAM: (sneezes)

2047
01:54:21,470 --> 01:54:22,543
MATT: Gesundheit.

2048
01:54:22,543 --> 01:54:23,547
LAURA and MARISHA: Bless you.

2049
01:54:23,547 --> 01:54:25,373
MATT: All right. Vax, you're up.

2050
01:54:25,373 --> 01:54:28,254
LIAM: Is that fellow who's enveloped in schmutz
right next to Grog?

2051
01:54:28,254 --> 01:54:29,047
MATT: Yep.

2052
01:54:29,047 --> 01:54:30,284
LIAM: Yeah, I'm going to stab him.

2053
01:54:30,284 --> 01:54:31,634
(laughter)

2054
01:54:31,634 --> 01:54:33,554
SAM: Your answer for everything.

2055
01:54:33,601 --> 01:54:36,540
LIAM: First one is not that great. It's a 14.

2056
01:54:36,540 --> 01:54:37,754
MATT: 14 misses.

2057
01:54:37,754 --> 01:54:39,250
LIAM: Second one is a 26.

2058
01:54:39,250 --> 01:54:40,861
MATT: You are flanking him, though. You have
advantage on the attack.

2059
01:54:40,861 --> 01:54:45,339
LIAM: Oh, well let's do that again, then. We'll
call that a 27 instead.

2060
01:54:45,339 --> 01:54:46,479
MATT: That hits.

2061
01:54:46,479 --> 01:54:53,994
LIAM: And then the second one is now a 20, and the
third one is a 26. (shunk, shunk, shunk) Two plus

2062
01:54:53,994 --> 01:55:01,119
seven is nine for the keen dagger, and then for
the life-stealing dagger is a seven, and then back

2063
01:55:01,119 --> 01:55:04,248
to the keen dagger, that is an 11.

2064
01:55:04,248 --> 01:55:06,194
LAURA: Don't you get sneak attack damage?

2065
01:55:06,194 --> 01:55:08,258
LIAM: Oh, right. Yeah, I'll put that in. Thank
you.

2066
01:55:08,258 --> 01:55:10,804
MATT: I was like, "Where's that? That's the whole
point of this."

2067
01:55:10,804 --> 01:55:15,699
SAM: All those?! Holy crap.

2068
01:55:15,699 --> 01:55:19,792
LIAM: Eight, nine, ten, 11, 17, 19.

2069
01:55:19,792 --> 01:55:22,410
MATT: (explosion noise)

2070
01:55:22,410 --> 01:55:23,789
LAURA: Oh, no, Grog!

2071
01:55:23,789 --> 01:55:25,144
MARISHA: Oh god, you killed Grog!

2072
01:55:25,144 --> 01:55:32,539
MATT: Yeah, the daggers cut through his
midsection, and you see where the armor plating

2073
01:55:32,539 --> 01:55:37,277
itself was exposed from the first strike. The last
one you just jam up into his torso, taking out any

2074
01:55:37,277 --> 01:55:38,359
major organs.

2075
01:55:38,359 --> 01:55:40,148
LIAM: I would also like to boot him over the side
as I do this.

2076
01:55:40,148 --> 01:55:44,188
MATT: (groans) He falls over (thudding) down the
stairs, past you, Percy. You let him tumble by as

2077
01:55:44,188 --> 01:55:45,867
he slides to a stop at the very bottom of the
stairs.

2078
01:55:45,867 --> 01:55:47,612
LAURA: I put my foot on him to stop him.

2079
01:55:47,612 --> 01:55:51,735
MATT: Okay, Vex stops him in place, face-down.
There's a smear of his blood across the steps.

2080
01:55:51,735 --> 01:56:01,806
This once-nice, fine wood is now completely coated
in crimson. (laughs) Okay. Grog, you're up.

2081
01:56:01,806 --> 01:56:06,443
TRAVIS: Is it me? (stuttering) Is it just a row of
guys in front of me?

2082
01:56:06,443 --> 01:56:07,794
MATT: Yeah.

2083
01:56:07,794 --> 01:56:16,178
TRAVIS: I would like to hold my turn. Because if I
stand in front of them, nobody can do anything to them.

2084
01:56:16,178 --> 01:56:17,835
SAM: You can.

2085
01:56:17,835 --> 01:56:21,770
LAURA: That's nice of you. You could just go
(whoosh) and cross them off.

2086
01:56:21,770 --> 01:56:23,122
MARISHA: How many's left?

2087
01:56:23,122 --> 01:56:25,653
MATT: There are five nervous-looking guards right
now.

2088
01:56:25,653 --> 01:56:27,771
MARISHA: They were trying to haul ass out?

2089
01:56:27,771 --> 01:56:30,354
TRAVIS: Nah, I'll hold. Whoever's next can go.

2090
01:56:30,354 --> 01:56:31,779
SAM: So polite.

2091
01:56:31,779 --> 01:56:33,960
LAURA: That is really kind of you, Grog.

2092
01:56:33,960 --> 01:56:38,977
MATT: That ends your turn. It is now the guards'
turn. They all...

2093
01:56:39,026 --> 01:56:40,895
LAURA: Run away.

2094
01:56:40,947 --> 01:56:42,467
MARISHA: They're going to try and flee, aren't
they?

2095
01:56:42,467 --> 01:56:49,760
MATT: They look to each other, and their one
leader goes like, "Men, run!" They all rush and

2096
01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:52,447
leap off the balcony, try and catch themselves
there.

2097
01:56:52,447 --> 01:56:55,036
LIAM: See those acrobatics checks...

2098
01:56:55,085 --> 01:56:57,200
LAURA: I want them all to fall, please.

2099
01:56:57,200 --> 01:56:59,065
MARISHA: Eat it. Make them all eat it.

2100
01:56:59,065 --> 01:57:04,331
MATT: Okay. Three of them land fine and begin
bolting forward. Two of them fall. One of them

2101
01:57:04,331 --> 01:57:07,455
(cracking noise) breaks his ankle and falls to the
ground going (scream). The other one slams into

2102
01:57:07,455 --> 01:57:14,040
his hip on the ground and falls prone. These guys
are prone. These three continue to move forward to

2103
01:57:14,040 --> 01:57:16,178
there. They're going for a full dash.

2104
01:57:16,178 --> 01:57:17,714
LAURA: Does Trinket get an attack of opportunity?

2105
01:57:17,714 --> 01:57:22,170
MATT: Against one of them. He can only take one
reaction per turn. They all rush out.

2106
01:57:22,170 --> 01:57:26,958
LAURA: That definitely hits him, though.

2107
01:57:26,958 --> 01:57:28,517
MATT: All righty.

2108
01:57:28,517 --> 01:57:29,694
LAURA: 27.

2109
01:57:29,694 --> 01:57:32,631
MATT: 27 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

2110
01:57:32,631 --> 01:57:34,036
LAURA: 11.

2111
01:57:34,036 --> 01:57:41,356
MATT: 11 points of damage. Across that guy. Okay.
Trinket reaches out and strikes across one of the

2112
01:57:41,400 --> 01:57:45,508
guys, the guy you Hunter's Marked, who takes the
claw across the side of his head, and you hear him

2113
01:57:45,508 --> 01:57:51,886
yell out in pain, (scream) as he makes it out into
the rain. Hurt, but not taken down. He continues

2114
01:57:51,886 --> 01:57:54,974
to run past, and they all dart outside into the
rainstorm.

2115
01:57:54,974 --> 01:57:57,167
TRAVIS: I'll take my turn now.

2116
01:57:57,167 --> 01:57:59,082
MATT: (laughs) Okay, Grog.

2117
01:57:59,082 --> 01:58:04,461
TRAVIS: I leap over the banister with my war
hammer high and jump down on the guy that's

2118
01:58:04,461 --> 01:58:10,386
closest to me, bringing it down with a reckless
attack and great weapon master.

2119
01:58:10,386 --> 01:58:13,156
MATT: Okay, make an athletics check for the jump.

2120
01:58:13,156 --> 01:58:14,359
TRAVIS: Okay.

2121
01:58:14,359 --> 01:58:16,047
SAM: Oh no, don't fall on your ass.

2122
01:58:16,047 --> 01:58:19,117
TRAVIS: Okay, that's true. 13.

2123
01:58:19,117 --> 01:58:22,262
MATT: I'll give you advantage on this because
you're raging and it's reckless and it's just

2124
01:58:22,262 --> 01:58:23,174
funnier.

2125
01:58:23,174 --> 01:58:24,496
TRAVIS and LAURA: That's better!

2126
01:58:24,496 --> 01:58:25,484
TRAVIS: 24.

2127
01:58:25,484 --> 01:58:32,122
MATT: 24, yeah. You leap in the air (whoosh) like
slow-motion (whoosh, explosion) down on top. Go

2128
01:58:32,122 --> 01:58:34,235
ahead and roll three attacks on him.

2129
01:58:34,235 --> 01:58:41,312
TRAVIS: Amazing, that's 27. That's 26.

2130
01:58:41,312 --> 01:58:42,911
MATT: Roll damage on those.

2131
01:58:42,911 --> 01:58:52,461
TRAVIS: Okay, not a problem. Ten, 19, 29 on the
first one.

2132
01:58:52,461 --> 01:58:54,568
MATT: 29 on the first one? Okay.

2133
01:58:54,568 --> 01:59:00,466
TRAVIS: (laughing) And 28 on the second one.

2134
01:59:00,466 --> 01:59:04,740
MATT: So as you come down, the hammer blow slams
into his torso, his actual metal armor

2135
01:59:04,740 --> 01:59:09,194
crinks inward, and he goes, (screams)
gasping in pain, as you've now jammed his own ribs

2136
01:59:09,194 --> 01:59:15,406
into his internal organs. As you pull the hammer
up with a sludgy, sucking sound you see

2137
01:59:15,406 --> 01:59:18,791
him look at you with this look of, "No!" and the hammer
comes down again. This time on top of his head,

2138
01:59:18,947 --> 01:59:26,177
which, Gallagher watermelon, just (boosh) across
the floor of this. Done, you look over at his

2139
01:59:26,177 --> 01:59:29,381
friend, who is like, (gasps) trying to back up
with his broken ankle. With your third attack,

2140
01:59:29,381 --> 01:59:30,977
he's within your range.

2141
01:59:30,977 --> 01:59:32,363
LAURA: Oh god.

2142
01:59:32,363 --> 01:59:33,896
TRAVIS: (inarticulate war cry)

2143
01:59:33,896 --> 01:59:35,177
MATT: With advantage.

2144
01:59:35,177 --> 01:59:37,164
TRAVIS: Oh, I don't need it. That's 27.

2145
01:59:37,164 --> 01:59:39,355
MATT: Roll advantage just in case it's a
critical.

2146
01:59:39,355 --> 01:59:41,076
TRAVIS: Oh, it's the same thing. It's 27.

2147
01:59:41,076 --> 01:59:42,541
MATT: Okay, there you go. That hits.

2148
01:59:42,541 --> 01:59:44,430
TRAVIS: I know. I haven't critted in forever.

2149
01:59:44,430 --> 01:59:47,993
MATT: Even if you don't need the advantage, it's
nice to roll a second time in case because there's

2150
01:59:47,993 --> 01:59:50,149
a chance of a natural 20.

2151
01:59:50,194 --> 01:59:51,372
TRAVIS: That's 20, 30.

2152
01:59:51,372 --> 01:59:56,710
MATT: 30 points of damage on him. (whack) This one
you actually bring down onto his other leg. That

2153
01:59:56,710 --> 01:59:57,740
leg snaps.

2154
01:59:57,740 --> 01:59:59,162
TRAVIS: Is he on his back?

2155
01:59:59,162 --> 02:00:00,612
MATT: He's on his back and he's trying to pull
away from you.

2156
02:00:00,612 --> 02:00:01,657
TRAVIS: Right on the knee.

2157
02:00:01,657 --> 02:00:04,782
MATT: Right on the knee? (crack) It snaps
underneath and he screams out in pain as the

2158
02:00:04,782 --> 02:00:09,430
hammer pulls back. You can see where the bone is
jutting out. You've actually taken off the lower

2159
02:00:09,430 --> 02:00:13,830
half of his leg from the sheer bludgeoning force,
and he's now bleeding out onto the ground a little

2160
02:00:13,830 --> 02:00:17,983
bit. Not as much as he would be, because the flame
cauterized the impact from the hammer.

2161
02:00:18,132 --> 02:00:19,887
SAM: (pained) So detailed.

2162
02:00:19,887 --> 02:00:27,672
MATT: He is in a really, really bad place. All
righty. Vex, you're up.

2163
02:00:27,672 --> 02:00:33,888
LAURA: Well, I'm going to-- should I shoot at the
guys running away?

2164
02:00:33,888 --> 02:00:35,051
TRAVIS: Yes.

2165
02:00:35,051 --> 02:00:37,352
LAURA: Yeah. Are they close by?

2166
02:00:37,352 --> 02:00:39,609
MATT: They're just out the front of the doors.

2167
02:00:39,609 --> 02:00:41,028
LAURA: I'm going to come down and get in range.

2168
02:00:41,028 --> 02:00:43,694
SAM: Don't forget to tell them about Gilmore's
Glorious Goods first.

2169
02:00:43,694 --> 02:00:45,577
(laughter)

2170
02:00:45,577 --> 02:00:47,465
SAM: We're supposed to advertise!

2171
02:00:47,465 --> 02:00:50,048
MATT: (giggles) Timing is everything.

2172
02:00:50,048 --> 02:00:55,751
LAURA: I'm going to lightning arrow because
everything within ten feet is affected.

2173
02:00:55,751 --> 02:01:02,309
MATT: Yeah, that would hit all three. All right,
you pull out your arrow. You aim it close. You can

2174
02:01:02,309 --> 02:01:05,216
see the rain pouring down and they're all running
out into the storm. You're like,

2175
02:01:05,216 --> 02:01:07,725
"Storm, that's interesting." And you release.

2176
02:01:07,761 --> 02:01:09,928
LAURA: 27? No, that's a lie. 19.

2177
02:01:09,928 --> 02:01:11,457
MATT: Against the guy you've Hunter's Marked?

2178
02:01:11,457 --> 02:01:12,232
LAURA: Yeah.

2179
02:01:12,232 --> 02:01:13,430
MATT: Yeah, that'll hit.

2180
02:01:13,430 --> 02:01:14,617
LAURA: And then get the rest of them?

2181
02:01:14,617 --> 02:01:15,568
MATT: Yep.

2182
02:01:15,568 --> 02:01:18,884
LAURA: So they have to make a dexterity saving
throw.

2183
02:01:18,884 --> 02:01:24,876
MATT: Okay. This guy fails. What's the DC on it?

2184
02:01:24,876 --> 02:01:27,618
LAURA: That's a good question.

2185
02:01:27,618 --> 02:01:29,322
MATT: It should be at the top of your spell
sheet.

2186
02:01:29,322 --> 02:01:30,212
LAURA: 15?

2187
02:01:30,212 --> 02:01:33,893
MATT: 15? Okay, second guy fails. Guy who's
Hunter's Marked does succeed, so he takes half

2188
02:01:33,893 --> 02:01:34,917
damage on it.

2189
02:01:34,917 --> 02:01:46,376
LAURA: Okay, I'm hitting him initially, so he
takes 2d8. They all take 2d8. 17, 19, plus

2190
02:01:46,376 --> 02:01:51,262
Hunter's Mark on the first guy. They all take 19,
and then the extra guy takes an extra five.

2191
02:01:51,262 --> 02:02:01,827
MATT: Okay. The guy that Trinket swiped just
screams (pained scream) as you can see the

2192
02:02:01,827 --> 02:02:06,630
electricity charging through him, and the wet rain
that hit him has caused it to even give more--

2193
02:02:06,630 --> 02:02:09,264
LAURA: I thought Trinket swiped the Hunter's
Marked guy, though.

2194
02:02:09,264 --> 02:02:10,252
MATT: Did he?

2195
02:02:10,252 --> 02:02:11,192
LAURA: He did.

2196
02:02:11,192 --> 02:02:12,070
MATT: Okay.

2197
02:02:12,070 --> 02:02:13,407
LAURA: I remember you saying that.

2198
02:02:13,407 --> 02:02:18,109
MATT: Then I'll give you that. So the guy who is
Hunter's Marked ends up destroyed, the electricity

2199
02:02:18,109 --> 02:02:22,062
bouncing through his armor. He goes, (moan) and
falls to the ground and crumples over. The other

2200
02:02:22,062 --> 02:02:25,674
two guys get jolted and almost knocked off their
feet. They're both looking really, really rough,

2201
02:02:25,674 --> 02:02:28,883
and they both look at each other (panting) and
just keep running with what little strength they

2202
02:02:28,883 --> 02:02:31,681
have left. You still have a second attack, don't
you?

2203
02:02:31,681 --> 02:02:32,891
LAURA: I do.

2204
02:02:32,891 --> 02:02:34,046
MATT: Go for it.

2205
02:02:34,046 --> 02:02:37,032
LAURA: Okay. Oh, gosh. I'm going to shoot--

2206
02:02:37,032 --> 02:02:39,389
SAM: You're going to shoot people in the back.

2207
02:02:39,389 --> 02:02:42,839
LAURA: No, I'm not going to shoot them in the
back. The guy on the ground, he looks like he's in

2208
02:02:42,874 --> 02:02:44,388
a lot of pain, doesn't he?

2209
02:02:44,388 --> 02:02:46,692
MATT: Oh, he's not going anywhere.

2210
02:02:46,692 --> 02:02:48,379
LAURA: I'm going to put him out of his misery.

2211
02:02:48,379 --> 02:02:50,988
TALIESIN: We don't want people running to report
we're here, though.

2212
02:02:50,988 --> 02:02:53,380
LAURA: Oh, really? So I should get the guys?

2213
02:02:53,380 --> 02:02:55,199
LIAM: Get them, yeah!

2214
02:02:55,199 --> 02:02:56,348
TALIESIN: No witnesses.

2215
02:02:56,348 --> 02:02:57,780
TRAVIS: They might be vampires.

2216
02:02:57,780 --> 02:02:58,775
TALIESIN: They might <i>call</i> vampires.

2217
02:02:58,775 --> 02:03:02,543
LAURA: Okay. I can't lightning arrow them again,
though.

2218
02:03:02,543 --> 02:03:03,844
MATT: No, it's a bonus action to cast it.

2219
02:03:03,844 --> 02:03:08,486
LAURA: So I'll just regular old attack and I can
only get one of them.

2220
02:03:08,486 --> 02:03:11,551
LIAM: I yell out from the top, "Vex, no
survivors!"

2221
02:03:11,551 --> 02:03:13,047
LAURA: All right, all right!

2222
02:03:13,047 --> 02:03:15,157
MATT: (zoomf) Next arrow nocked.

2223
02:03:15,157 --> 02:03:18,418
LAURA: That's a 19 again.

2224
02:03:18,418 --> 02:03:20,820
MATT: 19 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

2225
02:03:20,820 --> 02:03:23,541
LAURA: Okay. 13.

2226
02:03:23,541 --> 02:03:29,465
MATT: 13 points of damage. (zoomf) That guy is,
through the back of the head, (zoomf, groan) and

2227
02:03:29,465 --> 02:03:31,101
just slides through the mud for another two feet.

2228
02:03:31,101 --> 02:03:34,382
LAURA: And I act like I have another, that I can
attack him again. I say, "Stop!"

2229
02:03:34,382 --> 02:03:38,685
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

2230
02:03:38,685 --> 02:03:41,425
LIAM and SAM: Come on, girl.

2231
02:03:41,425 --> 02:03:43,090
LAURA: Natural 20!

2232
02:03:43,090 --> 02:03:44,699
(cheering)

2233
02:03:44,699 --> 02:03:46,486
TRAVIS: It is. It is.

2234
02:03:46,486 --> 02:03:51,384
MATT: Watching his friend fall and slide in the
mud, he stops where he stands and looks over his

2235
02:03:51,384 --> 02:03:53,675
shoulder, slowly turning around, shaking.

2236
02:03:53,675 --> 02:03:57,368
LAURA: And I say, "Get inside now."

2237
02:03:57,368 --> 02:04:03,007
MATT: Okay. Next up is Keyleth. Are you going to
do anything?

2238
02:04:03,007 --> 02:04:06,687
MARISHA: Do I kill him or do we keep him?

2239
02:04:06,687 --> 02:04:10,015
SAM: You have to make that decision yourself.

2240
02:04:10,015 --> 02:04:12,366
MARISHA: Is he coming back inside?

2241
02:04:12,366 --> 02:04:13,818
LAURA: He's standing there now.

2242
02:04:13,818 --> 02:04:17,063
MATT: He's currently standing about ten feet
outside in the rain, just (shaky breathing).

2243
02:04:17,063 --> 02:04:19,712
MARISHA: Is that a window I'm up against, behind
me?

2244
02:04:19,712 --> 02:04:23,432
MATT: Actually, no. There is no window to the
front here. It's just a wall.

2245
02:04:23,432 --> 02:04:30,756
MARISHA: I'm just going to go, "Excuse me. Excuse
me, Trinket. Sorry." And I'm going to peek around

2246
02:04:30,756 --> 02:04:34,334
the door and go (shkoof) and Sunbeam him.

2247
02:04:34,334 --> 02:04:36,356
MATT: You're going to Sunbeam?

2248
02:04:36,356 --> 02:04:38,565
MARISHA: That guy. That scared-shitless guy.

2249
02:04:38,565 --> 02:04:42,535
MATT: (laughs) Okay. What level is Sunbeam?

2250
02:04:42,535 --> 02:04:44,080
MARISHA: It's what I just did.

2251
02:04:44,080 --> 02:04:45,574
MATT: What level is Sunbeam?

2252
02:04:45,574 --> 02:04:46,789
MARISHA: Six.

2253
02:04:46,789 --> 02:04:50,136
MATT: How many 6th-level spells per day can you
cast?

2254
02:04:50,136 --> 02:04:51,826
MARISHA: It's a concentration spell.

2255
02:04:51,826 --> 02:04:54,040
MATT: Oh, that's right! You can do it for up to a
minute. Good call.

2256
02:04:54,040 --> 02:04:56,370
SAM: You can do that?

2257
02:04:56,370 --> 02:04:59,105
MARISHA: It's a concentration spell. I can keep
doing it for a minute.

2258
02:04:59,105 --> 02:05:00,753
LAURA: That's so freaking cool!

2259
02:05:00,753 --> 02:05:02,188
MARISHA: Yeah, it's pretty dope.

2260
02:05:02,188 --> 02:05:07,936
SAM: I can do that, too? I didn't know that. Well,
not that spell, but with anything.

2261
02:05:07,936 --> 02:05:12,816
MATT: All right, so constitution save on him.
(laughs) No. Do damage. 12.

2262
02:05:12,816 --> 02:05:25,714
MARISHA: 16. That's 23 plus... 30 damage. Radiant
damage. (lightning noise)

2263
02:05:25,714 --> 02:05:29,544
MATT: As he's standing in the rain, shaking, and
looking at his friend, and looking at you, Keyleth

2264
02:05:29,544 --> 02:05:36,049
steps into frame and goes, (boom). And before he
can go, "Wait!" and there's just this scattering

2265
02:05:36,049 --> 02:05:41,440
of ash that was once was his body. His armor is
left intact and just tumbles to the ground in this

2266
02:05:41,440 --> 02:05:48,011
pile. You see smoke sizzling off the now-heated
armor. There's no sign of his physical body

2267
02:05:48,011 --> 02:05:57,606
anymore, just a smattering of mud that the ash has
now mixed with in the rain outside. Melt with

2268
02:05:57,606 --> 02:05:59,340
prejudice, okay.

2269
02:05:59,340 --> 02:06:00,950
TRAVIS: Got one guy left.

2270
02:06:00,950 --> 02:06:04,038
MATT: Now as you guys are all gathering around,
we'll say from a roleplaying standpoint, as there

2271
02:06:04,038 --> 02:06:08,696
is no real immediate threat to you; there is one
guard left, who has currently one broken ankle and

2272
02:06:08,696 --> 02:06:13,908
one missing lower half of his left leg, on the
ground, looking at you all, hyperventilating and

2273
02:06:13,908 --> 02:06:17,970
trying to back away, like (panting).

2274
02:06:17,970 --> 02:06:19,819
TRAVIS: Time to call the Sandman.

2275
02:06:19,819 --> 02:06:25,858
MARISHA: Since I'm outside on the threshold of the
house, can I see where Scanlan might have lit up

2276
02:06:25,858 --> 02:06:27,541
the other house yet?

2277
02:06:27,541 --> 02:06:29,924
MATT: Make a perception check.

2278
02:06:29,924 --> 02:06:31,611
MARISHA: 17?

2279
02:06:31,611 --> 02:06:42,104
MATT: 17? You can see a little bit of a dark
stream in the distance. You can't tell if it's a

2280
02:06:42,104 --> 02:06:48,165
nearby chimney or if it is the symbol of Scanlan.
The rainstorm does make it a little hard to see,

2281
02:06:48,165 --> 02:06:51,854
at this point, and through the adrenaline pumping
in your system, and the fact that you just

2282
02:06:51,854 --> 02:06:56,802
disintegrated two individuals in a short period of
time. You're also wrestling with the morality of

2283
02:06:56,802 --> 02:07:03,480
that and dealing with what you just did, so your
concentration doesn't enable you to notice

2284
02:07:03,480 --> 02:07:04,654
anything yet.

2285
02:07:04,654 --> 02:07:05,983
MARISHA: Okay.

2286
02:07:05,983 --> 02:07:09,024
TRAVIS: Who's got questions for Peg-Leg over
here?

2287
02:07:09,024 --> 02:07:12,556
LIAM: I do. I hop down off the balcony and walk up
by Grog.

2288
02:07:12,556 --> 02:07:15,846
TALIESIN: I'm going to start exploring the
upstairs.

2289
02:07:15,846 --> 02:07:22,223
MARISHA: I stay standing outside just staring out
into the distance, waiting for Scanlan's cue.

2290
02:07:22,223 --> 02:07:23,385
MATT: Okay.

2291
02:07:23,385 --> 02:07:25,991
SAM: When you see my cue, attack.

2292
02:07:25,991 --> 02:07:27,828
(laughter)

2293
02:07:27,828 --> 02:07:30,404
MARISHA: Yeah, I know. Which is what we were
technically supposed to do.

2294
02:07:30,404 --> 02:07:34,103
LAURA: No, we said we were waiting 30 seconds and
then going in.

2295
02:07:34,103 --> 02:07:35,421
SAM: That was a terrible plan.

2296
02:07:35,421 --> 02:07:37,988
TRAVIS: Greatest plan we've ever had. You were
amazing.

2297
02:07:37,988 --> 02:07:40,127
LAURA: You know what? You were amazing, we killed
them, it was great.

2298
02:07:40,127 --> 02:07:47,432
TRAVIS: I hold my hammer over his other knee and I
go, "Look, we can work on you one limb at a time,

2299
02:07:47,467 --> 02:07:52,660
"or you can be very truthful and my friend can end
it all very, very quickly."

2300
02:07:52,660 --> 02:07:55,377
MATT: (panting) "What do you want?"

2301
02:07:55,425 --> 02:08:03,922
LIAM: There's no question, this is a bad situation
you're in right now. We're not looking for you at

2302
02:08:03,922 --> 02:08:10,709
all. I'm happy to knock you out and leave you in a
closet here and lock it. If you want to help me

2303
02:08:10,761 --> 02:08:18,175
find the Briarwoods, I really want to know where
the Briarwoods are. Not you. Just the people you

2304
02:08:18,175 --> 02:08:19,561
work for.

2305
02:08:19,561 --> 02:08:24,737
MATT: He looks around at the rest of the group,
sees you walk up the stairs. (panting) "They're in

2306
02:08:24,737 --> 02:08:27,317
"the bloody castle, where else would they be?"

2307
02:08:27,317 --> 02:08:32,090
TRAVIS: In? Or under?

2308
02:08:32,090 --> 02:08:34,677
LIAM: That's a good question.

2309
02:08:34,677 --> 02:08:41,676
MATT: "I don't know. I don't know. They spend
equal parts in both, as far as I know."

2310
02:08:41,676 --> 02:08:46,361
LAURA: I peek around my brother and go, "Isn't
there anyone else in the house?"

2311
02:08:46,361 --> 02:08:48,184
MATT: "No."

2312
02:08:48,184 --> 02:08:50,744
LAURA: If you're lying, you'll pay.

2313
02:08:50,744 --> 02:08:53,800
MATT: "All of us who were here, we were waiting
for you."

2314
02:08:53,800 --> 02:08:55,908
LAURA: "Got it." I go upstairs with Percy.

2315
02:08:55,908 --> 02:08:59,896
TALIESIN: That mist is probably following me
around at this point, isn't it?

2316
02:08:59,896 --> 02:09:01,540
MATT: The black smoke, you mean?

2317
02:09:01,540 --> 02:09:02,504
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2318
02:09:02,504 --> 02:09:07,426
MATT: Oh, yeah. The black smoke is slowly trailing
behind you. With each step you take, it licks the

2319
02:09:07,426 --> 02:09:08,654
back of your boots.

2320
02:09:08,654 --> 02:09:10,210
TALIESIN: Oh, boy. Okay.

2321
02:09:10,210 --> 02:09:19,035
LIAM: Is there anything else you can tell me in
regards to back doors or secrets that your bosses

2322
02:09:19,035 --> 02:09:23,435
don't want us to know? I mean, really, this is the
time to talk, right now.

2323
02:09:23,435 --> 02:09:26,407
TRAVIS: Anything you use to identify each other?

2324
02:09:26,407 --> 02:09:33,086
MATT: Go ahead and make an intimidation check.
With advantage because he has--

2325
02:09:33,086 --> 02:09:34,759
SAM and MARISHA: One leg?

2326
02:09:34,759 --> 02:09:38,500
MATT: He's bleeding out right now. Wait, no, he's
not bleeding out. He's bleeding, but it's a

2327
02:09:38,500 --> 02:09:40,038
trickle because of the cauterization.

2328
02:09:40,038 --> 02:09:41,102
LIAM: 21.

2329
02:09:41,102 --> 02:09:55,062
MATT: 21. He gives you a look and says, "Look.
We've all been working for the Briarwoods. They

2330
02:09:55,062 --> 02:10:00,664
"mean well. They have big plans, I know that. I
don't know the details of it. They don't tell us.

2331
02:10:00,664 --> 02:10:09,456
"But we're keeping guard on them. We were supposed
to stop this insurrection. These people. We

2332
02:10:09,456 --> 02:10:17,160
"rounded up folks. We were given basic descriptions
and we hung people against the Sun Tree as a

2333
02:10:17,160 --> 02:10:21,977
"warning. We hoped it wouldn't come to any sort of
conflict, that you would take that as a means that

2334
02:10:21,977 --> 02:10:28,232
"you weren't supposed to be here. But then we all
saw what happened. What happened to Sir Kerrion

2335
02:10:28,315 --> 02:10:33,959
"and his house, and that meant that you were here
and that you meant business, so Tylieri and

2336
02:10:33,959 --> 02:10:42,063
"Vedmeyer, we waited for a signal. And we heard
that you were planning an attack, so we set up

2337
02:10:42,063 --> 02:10:48,627
"guards here and prepared, and sure enough, you
showed up. Which let us know that our contacts are

2338
02:10:48,627 --> 02:10:54,329
"good, and we thought that would be enough. We
didn't realize you'd be walking in with whatever

2339
02:10:54,329 --> 02:10:59,349
"the fuck this thing is. I don't even know what you
are." And he looks genuinely frightened at the

2340
02:10:59,349 --> 02:11:02,515
fact that you, with all of these bolts sticking
out of your body, are still grinning above him.

2341
02:11:02,515 --> 02:11:05,868
"Nothing should have survived that ambush."

2342
02:11:05,868 --> 02:11:08,908
LIAM: Let's back this up a little bit. You hung
people from the Sun Tree?

2343
02:11:08,908 --> 02:11:11,105
MATT: "Yeah, as a warning."

2344
02:11:11,105 --> 02:11:14,894
LIAM: "Where I saw that child?" I slit his
throat.

2345
02:11:14,894 --> 02:11:23,910
MATT: (extended choking sounds) With a wet gurgle,
the life expires from his body, a pool beginning

2346
02:11:23,910 --> 02:11:25,829
to form on the tile below him.

2347
02:11:25,829 --> 02:11:28,172
TRAVIS: Nicely done, Vax.

2348
02:11:28,172 --> 02:11:31,771
LIAM: Piece of shit.

2349
02:11:31,771 --> 02:11:34,421
LAURA: So Percy and I are upstairs alone?

2350
02:11:34,421 --> 02:11:35,396
MATT: Yes.

2351
02:11:35,396 --> 02:11:36,714
TRAVIS: Can I check his body?

2352
02:11:36,714 --> 02:11:42,909
MATT: (laughs) You begin rummaging through the
body. You're keeping an eye out. Make another

2353
02:11:42,909 --> 02:11:43,916
perception check.

2354
02:11:43,916 --> 02:11:48,711
LAURA: I go upstairs, and I get Percy up against a
wall. I turn around and slam him against a wall.

2355
02:11:48,711 --> 02:11:49,710
MATT: Okay.

2356
02:11:49,710 --> 02:11:50,865
SAM: This is sexy.

2357
02:11:50,865 --> 02:11:52,064
MARISHA: 27.

2358
02:11:52,064 --> 02:11:54,163
LAURA: And I look him straight in the eye--

2359
02:11:54,163 --> 02:11:55,474
SAM: And kiss him.

2360
02:11:55,474 --> 02:12:00,365
LAURA: And I say, "Are you all right?"

2361
02:12:00,365 --> 02:12:04,999
TALIESIN: I think so.

2362
02:12:04,999 --> 02:12:07,702
LAURA: Look me in the eye, Percy.

2363
02:12:07,702 --> 02:12:20,676
TALIESIN: I feel cruel, but in control. This is
controllable, at the moment.

2364
02:12:20,676 --> 02:12:24,181
LAURA: "All right." I'm insight-checking him.

2365
02:12:24,181 --> 02:12:26,605
MATT: Go for it. Roll insight.

2366
02:12:26,605 --> 02:12:30,909
LAURA: Shit, just shit. Ten.

2367
02:12:30,909 --> 02:12:32,185
MATT: Ten?

2368
02:12:32,185 --> 02:12:33,662
MARISHA: Fuck.

2369
02:12:33,662 --> 02:12:36,489
MATT: What's your charisma modifier?

2370
02:12:36,489 --> 02:12:38,296
TALIESIN: My charisma modifier is two.

2371
02:12:38,296 --> 02:12:49,904
MATT: Okay. He's hard to read right now. His focus
is divided amongst your intensity and trying to

2372
02:12:49,904 --> 02:12:53,792
answer your question. The pause in his throat
isn't because he's thinking, it's because he

2373
02:12:53,792 --> 02:12:59,737
grasps the words to describe it, but there is a
quiver to it, and you can see his hands are still

2374
02:12:59,737 --> 02:13:03,753
shaking a little bit. And as you look down at his
hands, you can also see the smoke is still slowly

2375
02:13:03,753 --> 02:13:07,146
swirling his ankle.

2376
02:13:07,146 --> 02:13:13,140
TALIESIN: I'm fine, for now. I'll let you know.
You'll know if I'm not.

2377
02:13:13,140 --> 02:13:14,294
LAURA: I will.

2378
02:13:14,294 --> 02:13:15,541
TALIESIN: Yes.

2379
02:13:15,541 --> 02:13:17,756
LAURA: I follow behind him closely.

2380
02:13:17,756 --> 02:13:19,219
TALIESIN: Let's keep looking.

2381
02:13:19,219 --> 02:13:23,316
MATT: Okay. You start seeing, now, the dark plume
of smoke in the distance. Scanlan has apparently

2382
02:13:23,316 --> 02:13:31,711
and effectively set the signal. You also do
notice, as you're looking out, other people have

2383
02:13:31,711 --> 02:13:33,648
left their homes now--
