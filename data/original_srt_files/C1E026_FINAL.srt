00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,353
MATT: Hello everyone and welcome to Critical Role:
an online show on Twitch where a bunch of us

2
00:00:05,353 --> 00:00:10,531
nerdy-ass voice actors roll dice and play Dungeons
and Dragons. My name is Matthew Mercer. I'm the

3
00:00:10,531 --> 00:00:16,727
Dungeon Master. For returning fans, welcome, and
for new folks, prepare. A couple of fun things to

4
00:00:16,727 --> 00:00:21,847
announce: first things first, unfortunately we are
down a Percy this evening. Our buddy Taliesin

5
00:00:21,847 --> 00:00:26,566
picked up a con plague in Alaska this past
weekend. He had a great time, but came back very

6
00:00:26,566 --> 00:00:32,434
ill and has been trying to get better, and is
unable to make the game tonight. Which makes the

7
00:00:32,434 --> 00:00:39,673
current storyline a little interesting, but we'll
work it out. It's fine. No Mercy Percy is going to

8
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:47,986
have some business he's attending to. Thank the
Critters for that. That's an awesome hashtag! So

9
00:00:47,986 --> 00:00:53,694
Taliesin, I hope you feel better. We miss you.
Next week we continue that arc.

10
00:00:53,694 --> 00:01:01,623
Let's see, first and foremost, still every 100
subs we get on the channel we have a giveaway to

11
00:01:01,623 --> 00:01:06,474
someone who's active in the chatroom. The winner
of that giveaway gets a signed picture of the cast

12
00:01:06,474 --> 00:01:11,029
of Critical Role, as well as a signed poster by
our amazing artist Kit Buss, who was with us for

13
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:18,196
our last session. Those are both given away to
whoever wins that, so keep those subs going. Also,

14
00:01:18,196 --> 00:01:23,956
there is currently going around a hashtag: No
Shave 'Til 10k. A number of people on the stream

15
00:01:23,956 --> 00:01:34,265
are a part of that. All sexes can compete and be a
part of this, too. No Shave 'Til 10k. If you want

16
00:01:34,265 --> 00:01:38,534
to be a part of that, go ahead and tweet that out.
Get that hashtag going and I'll see if I can

17
00:01:38,534 --> 00:01:45,486
convince Marisha to let me do that. We'll see. At
the very least, for my Halloween costume.

18
00:01:45,486 --> 00:01:52,322
All right, so other cool things to talk about: all
of tonight's donations are going towards the Extra

19
00:01:52,322 --> 00:01:58,211
Life charity. The Extra Life charity is a drive
that's part of the Children's Miracle Network

20
00:01:58,211 --> 00:02:02,598
Hospitals. A lot of great people in the community
have been supporting this and we're supporting

21
00:02:02,598 --> 00:02:08,517
that tonight. So any donations tonight will go to
Extra Life. Also over the next two days, we will

22
00:02:08,517 --> 00:02:15,565
also be streaming here at Geek and Sundry doing a
lot of other charity events for the Extra Life

23
00:02:15,565 --> 00:02:22,513
charity drive, including a small DND game-- some
of us-- on Saturday evening with the Vox Moronica

24
00:02:22,513 --> 00:02:31,297
crew. So that should be fun. Come check that out!
Oh, Dungeons and Dragons, the official Wizards of

25
00:02:31,297 --> 00:02:37,180
the Coast folks are also doing their Extra Life
stream over the next 48 hours. They're just going

26
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:43,410
to be doing live DND streams as well. So starting
tomorrow at noon through Sunday at noon, just

27
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:47,569
constant DND on the Wizards of the Coast stream as
well. And all of that is going to be raising money

28
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:53,632
for Extra Life. So you'll have a lot of things to
keep you busy this weekend essentially. So there's

29
00:02:53,632 --> 00:03:02,830
that. Also, we have New York Comic Con coming up
in just a couple of weeks. Excited about that, for

30
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:08,121
all you guys. We have panels on Saturday. Do we
have times for those yet?

31
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:11,355
LIAM: Between 1:00 and 4:00 is when we're doing
stuff.

32
00:03:11,355 --> 00:03:14,753
MATT: Yeah, between 1:00 and 4:00. We have about
an hour panel in there somewhere and then probably

33
00:03:14,753 --> 00:03:19,436
two hours of signings at the event on Saturday. So
1:00 and 4:00! Leave that period of time open.

34
00:03:19,436 --> 00:03:20,745
Hang out.

35
00:03:20,745 --> 00:03:22,367
MARISHA: We'll have prints!

36
00:03:22,367 --> 00:03:26,638
MATT: Exactly! And then on Sunday, outside of the
convention, because we know a lot of the badges

37
00:03:26,638 --> 00:03:30,270
were snatched up before this announcement even
happened and a lot of the Critters aren't able to

38
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:35,072
make it to the actual con. On Sunday, we're
looking around midday. We don't have a time or

39
00:03:35,072 --> 00:03:39,424
location determined yet, but that will be up on
Twitter soon. It's going to happen. We're going to

40
00:03:39,424 --> 00:03:43,756
have an offsite Critter meetup. Where we're going
to all be able to be there, hang out with you guys

41
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:50,138
and catch up, sign stuff, say hi, and have a good
time. So watch Twitter. If you don't follow us on

42
00:03:50,138 --> 00:03:53,943
Twitter, do it, because we'll have those
announcements coming up very soon. So excited

43
00:03:53,943 --> 00:03:56,159
about that. Liam, you wanted to announce--

44
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,472
LIAM: Yes! This is the final chance for y'all to
jump on Joe Madureira's Kickstarter, Battle

45
00:04:01,472 --> 00:04:06,964
Chasers: Nightwar. They have absolutely killed
their Kickstarter. They hit their goal, their

46
00:04:06,964 --> 00:04:11,856
initial goal about two or three days in, and they
have been hitting every single stretch goal

47
00:04:11,856 --> 00:04:17,116
they've had. They've got one last mystery stretch
goal left to hit. So it's a good time to get in

48
00:04:17,116 --> 00:04:23,826
and just get them to the very tippy, tippy top of
their campaign, which is about to end. If you guys

49
00:04:23,826 --> 00:04:26,681
don't know, really quick, because I've been
talking about it for two weeks: Joe Madureira,

50
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:33,647
amazing comic book legend, has drawn everything.
It looks like nobody else's and has a good history

51
00:04:33,647 --> 00:04:38,994
in game dev as well. Created Darksiders with his
company, Vigil Games, that he helped found. And

52
00:04:38,994 --> 00:04:45,979
now he has founded Airship Syndicate, and they're
making an RPG in the style of JRPGs that you've

53
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:52,086
loved in your lives. But also with Joe's
ridonkulous art style. So go get on it.

54
00:04:52,086 --> 00:04:57,878
MATT: Yeah! Thank you, Liam. Orion, you wanted to
say something real fast as well.

55
00:04:57,878 --> 00:05:08,295
ORION: Yes. Greetings and salutations, everyone!
Last week when Kit was here-- Hi Kit, we miss

56
00:05:08,295 --> 00:05:16,362
you! We went to It's a Wrap over in Burbank,
California. Me and Liam and Laura and Marisha and

57
00:05:16,362 --> 00:05:27,295
Kit and her hubby. We were there and saw this
robe, and I think Marisha and Laura were like, try

58
00:05:27,295 --> 00:05:31,365
it on, and I was like, okay. And I tried it on and
was like, oh my god, it was made for me.

59
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:35,692
MATT: The Tiberius robe you always knew-- or
didn't know you wanted.

60
00:05:35,692 --> 00:05:42,534
ORION: Yeah, totally, I was like, oh my god, and
Liam tweeted a picture about it, and then I was

61
00:05:42,534 --> 00:05:51,602
streaming on my stream on Twitch and somebody
mentioned the robe. And Michael Bauman-- thank you

62
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:55,719
again, I'm going to thank you on Critical Role
for-- he donated $400, which was the cost of the

63
00:05:55,719 --> 00:06:03,510
robe, and then he just wrote in the chat, this is
for the robe, so I'm wearing the robe.

64
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,199
LAURA: That's awesome!

65
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,538
ORION: Thank you very much. Thank you so much you
guys and all you guys who pitched in and stuff.

66
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:11,775
Thank you.

67
00:06:11,775 --> 00:06:20,343
MATT: We'll find many cool excuses to have that
robe be displayed and utilized in many ways. I'm

68
00:06:20,343 --> 00:06:22,047
pretty sure he hasn't taken it off since he got
it.

69
00:06:22,047 --> 00:06:23,769
LAURA: Yeah, it smells really bad, you guys.

70
00:06:23,769 --> 00:06:33,550
MATT: Awesome! Anybody else have any other
announcements before we get this party started?

71
00:06:33,635 --> 00:06:34,943
TRAVIS: I like cheese.

72
00:06:34,943 --> 00:06:36,575
MATT: Travis likes cheese, ladies and gentlemen.

73
00:06:36,575 --> 00:06:37,766
LAURA: That's a good announcement.

74
00:06:37,766 --> 00:06:43,234
MATT: I think so. It was very informative. Thank
you, Travis. All right, then. Without further ado,

75
00:06:43,234 --> 00:06:48,126
let's go ahead and cut to the intro and then we'll
jump right into the next episode of Critical Role.

76
00:06:48,126 --> 00:07:56,364
[dramatic music]

77
00:07:56,364 --> 00:08:03,678
MATT: Welcome back! So picking up after the events
of last week, to give you guys a little bit of a

78
00:08:03,678 --> 00:08:09,171
refresher. After the party had returned from their
journey into Vasselheim for quite a few weeks,

79
00:08:09,171 --> 00:08:17,016
they discovered upon returning that the
illustrious Briarwoods, current owners of Castle

80
00:08:17,016 --> 00:08:22,873
Whitestone and overseers of the entire city of
Whitestone and sticking point in Percy's

81
00:08:22,873 --> 00:08:32,284
background, were coming to Emon to meet for
essentially a political banquet with Sovereign

82
00:08:32,284 --> 00:08:38,442
Uriel Tal'Dorei to discuss construction of a
bridge. It was a very political endeavor. And the

83
00:08:38,442 --> 00:08:42,162
council of Tal'Dorei was invited, including Vox
Machina.

84
00:08:42,162 --> 00:08:49,709
There was a week of preparation in going into this
event to see exactly what the Briarwoods were

85
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:59,712
about. Information was gathered at this banquet.
Vax went on his own little adventure into the

86
00:08:59,712 --> 00:09:06,234
Briarwoods' room, in which they nearly killed him.
(chuckles)

87
00:09:06,234 --> 00:09:07,738
LIAM: Hey, everybody!

88
00:09:07,738 --> 00:09:14,840
MATT: I didn't notice the shirt until now. So
yeah, the party rushed out to his aid. Much

89
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:24,567
violence ensued. The Briarwoods eventually escaped
through some sort of magical means that was not

90
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:29,772
uncovered. However, they are no longer in the
picture. The party was left with a destroyed

91
00:09:29,772 --> 00:09:37,822
carriage, a young carriage driver who had his hand
shot off by Percy, and was then told to the guards

92
00:09:37,822 --> 00:09:43,683
to haul off and bring to their keep to throw into
their cell for further questioning. Uriel was

93
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:48,687
eventually drawn out and confused by the sudden
chaos and vehemently requested that Vox Machina

94
00:09:48,687 --> 00:09:55,476
return the next morning to go over what has
transpired. After which, the party during this

95
00:09:55,476 --> 00:09:59,760
event had encountered a tiefling by the name of
Lillith, who was masquerading as one of the

96
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:06,047
servants within the palace of Tal'Dorei. Aided
them in the battle and revealed that she was being

97
00:10:06,047 --> 00:10:13,848
hunted by her sisters in a distant land and
revealing herself here essentially opened up her

98
00:10:13,848 --> 00:10:21,158
physical presence to be pinpointed and then
immediately sought and hunted by whoever was after

99
00:10:21,158 --> 00:10:26,232
her. The party then brought her back to the keep.
They were on the way back before they were

100
00:10:26,232 --> 00:10:30,870
encountered by this bounty hunter and a small team
of individuals that were coming with him to seek

101
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:35,443
down, capture Lillith, and bring her back to her
sisters. The party then defended her in this

102
00:10:35,443 --> 00:10:44,867
circumstance, brutally murdering one of them.
Sorry, brutally murdering two of them. One of

103
00:10:44,867 --> 00:10:52,293
which was then raised and sent off as a present to
the sisters by Lillith. One was salvaged, not

104
00:10:52,293 --> 00:10:58,121
given an honorable death, and sent to find his way
somewhere northwest of Emon. Possibly towards

105
00:10:58,121 --> 00:11:05,146
Vasselheim or wherever else he may find his
adventure. They then gave Lillith the opportunity

106
00:11:05,146 --> 00:11:10,940
to come stay the night to rest in the keep and they
all made their way back to Greyskull Keep for the

107
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,328
evening. And that was where we left off.

108
00:11:13,328 --> 00:11:20,119
So as the evening progresses you all manage to get
your rest and gather your thoughts over the rather

109
00:11:20,119 --> 00:11:27,808
stressful experience you had the previous evening
within the palace. The next morning comes around.

110
00:11:27,808 --> 00:11:35,830
You all come to consciousness. Breakfast is
prepared by the servants of the keep. As you all

111
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:42,415
wake up, start getting your meals and gathering
what you want to do for the day, two individuals

112
00:11:42,415 --> 00:11:45,720
have not come down for their meal. Lillith and
Percy.

113
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,116
ORION: Good morning, everyone!

114
00:11:49,116 --> 00:11:54,269
SAM: Not everyone. We're missing two. A male and a
female.

115
00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:56,504
LAURA: Oh. No.

116
00:11:56,504 --> 00:11:58,484
TRAVIS: You don't think?

117
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,572
LAURA: Percy was upset.

118
00:12:00,572 --> 00:12:02,717
SAM: Maybe he needed some comforting.

119
00:12:02,717 --> 00:12:05,555
ORION: Oh, I see. Are you saying they're having
relations?

120
00:12:05,555 --> 00:12:07,438
SAM: I'm not saying that.

121
00:12:07,438 --> 00:12:10,524
LAURA: Perhaps we should check on them?

122
00:12:10,524 --> 00:12:13,782
TRAVIS: We should totally check on them!

123
00:12:13,782 --> 00:12:17,376
SAM: Okay, but if there's a sock or a gun on the
doorknob, don't go in.

124
00:12:17,376 --> 00:12:19,849
LAURA: Or a ribbon. She wore a ribbon.

125
00:12:19,849 --> 00:12:26,013
ORION: Well, I was thinking last night, Grog, that
we're probably going to be here for a little bit

126
00:12:26,013 --> 00:12:30,812
before going anywhere. Do we go anywhere?

127
00:12:30,812 --> 00:12:32,880
LAURA: We have to go see Uriel.

128
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:41,208
ORION: Who? Oh. Right! Yes! Also, I really want to
see Allura. For no particular-- actually for very

129
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:42,903
specific reasons. Yes.

130
00:12:42,903 --> 00:12:45,230
TRAVIS: I think he's lying.

131
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:53,166
ORION: One of them is: I want to pick up one of
the Earrings of Telecommunication. It has been

132
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:57,638
finished for quite some time. We just have to go
to where she resides to pick it up. Then one of us

133
00:12:57,638 --> 00:12:59,246
could have another one.

134
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:01,381
LIAM: That robe just takes it to a whole new
level!

135
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:03,069
LAURA: Yeah, it really does.

136
00:13:03,069 --> 00:13:04,689
ORION: I feel so good.

137
00:13:04,689 --> 00:13:07,347
LIAM: I'm somewhat entranced.

138
00:13:07,347 --> 00:13:09,484
ORION: I'm telling you, it's helping, too.

139
00:13:09,484 --> 00:13:13,184
TRAVIS: Do I feel a little tingle from my belt?
And can I roll for a beard check?

140
00:13:13,184 --> 00:13:15,456
SAM: Oh, beard check?

141
00:13:15,456 --> 00:13:18,728
TRAVIS: Six. Two.

142
00:13:18,728 --> 00:13:25,956
MATT: You wake up, realizing that the morning has
transpired. You reach up and grab. And what you

143
00:13:25,956 --> 00:13:29,711
guys notice as he comes up is there is a dark
charcoal smear across one side of his face where

144
00:13:29,711 --> 00:13:36,500
facial hair would once be, to match the other side
that is currently beautiful quaff and shining in

145
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,438
the dapples of morning light that come through the
keep window.

146
00:13:40,438 --> 00:13:43,243
TRAVIS: You know the remedy for it, you just turn
your face in the looking glass.

147
00:13:43,243 --> 00:13:45,791
LAURA: Yeah, from this angle you look amazing
Grog.

148
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:52,726
TRAVIS: My god, I'm so handsome. Right? And then
just horror. Sheer horror.

149
00:13:52,726 --> 00:13:59,070
ORION: (poof) A little dust and fix that for him.

150
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:05,845
LAURA: Oh, so it looks normal again? I like it!
Yeah. Beautiful. Don't touch it.

151
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:09,057
MATT: The color's a little off, but it looks
better than not having it.

152
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:15,418
MARISHA: In my head you're like those Mr. Wooly
magnetic toys when you're a kid.

153
00:14:15,418 --> 00:14:21,398
TRAVIS: I would shave it and get it even, but
let's be honest, given history, it's going to take

154
00:14:21,398 --> 00:14:24,499
care of itself soon enough. These things don't
live very long.

155
00:14:24,499 --> 00:14:32,329
LAURA: I'm going to go upstairs and see if our
guest, Lillith, is all right. I don't want to

156
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:33,744
disturb Percy just yet.

157
00:14:33,744 --> 00:14:38,409
MATT: All right. You head to the guest room. You
have one guest room upstairs that was among the

158
00:14:38,409 --> 00:14:39,928
rest of the rooms that you guys had constructed.

159
00:14:39,928 --> 00:14:41,895
TRAVIS: (singing) They're going to be getting it
on!

160
00:14:41,895 --> 00:14:46,412
MATT: You knock on the door. A moment passes. No
response.

161
00:14:46,412 --> 00:14:52,337
LAURA: Lillith? Are you with Percy? Lillith?

162
00:14:52,337 --> 00:14:55,517
MATT: You knock a second time and the door
(creaks) opens a little bit. It has not really

163
00:14:55,517 --> 00:14:57,056
been locked or closed.

164
00:14:57,056 --> 00:14:58,712
LAURA: I peek my head in.

165
00:14:58,712 --> 00:14:59,872
MATT: You peek in and look.

166
00:14:59,872 --> 00:15:01,247
TRAVIS: Did you check for traps?

167
00:15:01,247 --> 00:15:06,251
MATT: Roll a-- no, I'm kidding.

168
00:15:06,251 --> 00:15:07,872
(laughter)

169
00:15:07,872 --> 00:15:09,243
LAURA: Damn it!

170
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:16,012
MATT: Already off! No. As you peek into the room,
the lights are dimmed. What little bit of candles

171
00:15:16,012 --> 00:15:24,346
are in there are already down. Glancing in, the
sheets are clean and set, the bed's been made, and

172
00:15:24,346 --> 00:15:28,208
there is a small piece of parchment that is folded
on the edge of the bed.

173
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,956
LAURA: Go and read it.

174
00:15:29,956 --> 00:15:37,956
MATT: Read it? It reads, "Vox Machina, thank you
all for your hospitality and protection through

175
00:15:37,956 --> 00:15:46,989
"this past evening. I would stay, but the longer I
remain, the more danger I am in, and as such, put

176
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:53,650
"all of you in as well. I shall travel across the
Ozmit Sea to seek the guidance of my cousin Zahra,

177
00:15:53,650 --> 00:16:01,373
"in hopes of finally getting out from under my
sisters' baneful gaze. Nevertheless, I wish you

178
00:16:01,373 --> 00:16:06,688
"all the finest of journeys, and I hope we meet
again soon. Lillith."

179
00:16:06,688 --> 00:16:09,453
LAURA: She's so cute.

180
00:16:09,453 --> 00:16:14,826
MARISHA: I liked her bow. It was cute.

181
00:16:14,826 --> 00:16:18,602
LAURA: I tell everyone that she's gone. Gone.

182
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:22,861
TRAVIS: No, she's in Percy's room! Scanlan, let's
go see if he's banging!

183
00:16:22,861 --> 00:16:23,874
SAM: All right, let's go!

184
00:16:23,874 --> 00:16:25,831
(laughter)

185
00:16:25,831 --> 00:16:30,425
MATT: You run up and Percy's room is-- the door is
already partially ajar.

186
00:16:30,425 --> 00:16:31,666
TRAVIS: (boom)

187
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:39,113
MATT: It bursts open. (wham) Slams on the side of
the door, looking in the room. He's not there, is

188
00:16:39,113 --> 00:16:44,463
the first thing you notice. However, what you do
see are a series of different books of sketches

189
00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:51,045
and designs and half-concocted blueprints for
different things are crumpled and torn across the

190
00:16:51,045 --> 00:16:55,371
room. The bedsheets are thrown off the bed. It
looks like the room has been continuously tossed

191
00:16:55,371 --> 00:17:00,127
through some sort of frenzied action, either
seeking something or just out of emotional

192
00:17:00,127 --> 00:17:04,511
frustration. This room is left in far more
disarray than you're used to seeing true to

193
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,932
Percy's character.

194
00:17:05,932 --> 00:17:08,376
SAM: My god, Grog. Percy's a hoarder.

195
00:17:08,376 --> 00:17:10,793
TRAVIS: Right.

196
00:17:10,793 --> 00:17:13,069
SAM: Or he's in serious distress.

197
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:15,558
TRAVIS: I think it's the previous.

198
00:17:15,558 --> 00:17:16,897
SAM: The hoarder?

199
00:17:16,897 --> 00:17:18,459
TRAVIS: Yeah. Probably.

200
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:24,064
SAM: We must find him, don't you think? Our
friend's in trouble. I proceed down to his

201
00:17:24,064 --> 00:17:27,842
tinkering lab. Doesn't he have some sort of lab
downstairs?

202
00:17:27,842 --> 00:17:30,197
TRAVIS: My room's like shit, and I'm not in
trouble.

203
00:17:30,197 --> 00:17:32,211
SAM: Well, that goes with your character.

204
00:17:32,211 --> 00:17:35,829
MATT: Yeah. You head down to the basement area,
and to the right is the cell, to the left is the

205
00:17:35,829 --> 00:17:43,126
workshop. The workshop door is currently closed.
There is a small slider eye vent where you can

206
00:17:43,126 --> 00:17:44,594
peek through.

207
00:17:44,594 --> 00:17:46,298
SAM: Can I reach the eye vent?

208
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:49,250
MATT: You can if you leap hard enough and catch it
on the edge.

209
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,767
TRAVIS: I boost him up.

210
00:17:50,767 --> 00:18:01,008
MATT: Okay. Looking inside, you can see, the forge
is aglow. You hear the tangs of metal being

211
00:18:01,008 --> 00:18:06,634
hammered against the anvil, and you can see the
form of Percy framed against the backlighting of

212
00:18:06,634 --> 00:18:09,668
the forge. He's feverishly working away on some
sort of project.

213
00:18:09,668 --> 00:18:11,063
TRAVIS: Is he naked?

214
00:18:11,063 --> 00:18:17,201
SAM: No, he's working too hard. Maybe we should
just leave him be. Seems focused, driven, like a

215
00:18:17,201 --> 00:18:18,318
madman.

216
00:18:18,318 --> 00:18:21,275
TRAVIS: Oh. I get it. Like a madman?

217
00:18:21,275 --> 00:18:23,128
SAM: I don't think you do.

218
00:18:23,128 --> 00:18:27,853
MATT: At which point a voice rings out from across
the room: Percy unmoving, still continuing his

219
00:18:27,853 --> 00:18:34,901
work, shouts over his shoulder, "Please, leave me
be. I have a lot to think about right now."

220
00:18:34,901 --> 00:18:37,894
SAM: Would you like a meal brought down?

221
00:18:37,894 --> 00:18:45,789
MATT: "I'm fine. Thank you. Really. I need some
time."

222
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:50,753
SAM: All right. If you're making things, a little
ladder for the little perch here might be nice.

223
00:18:50,753 --> 00:18:54,754
Just in the future! But not now. That seems low
priority.

224
00:18:54,754 --> 00:18:58,504
MATT: He stops his banging, walks over and
scribbles something on a paper, then goes back to

225
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:01,291
banging. "Noted." (clanging)

226
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:07,214
TRAVIS: I drop Scanlan and I lean in and I go,
beware the water! It burns!

227
00:19:07,214 --> 00:19:11,911
MATT: "Yes. Yes, it does, Grog. Good boy."

228
00:19:11,911 --> 00:19:20,808
SAM: All right. So we go back up. Tell the
fellows, Percy's in a mood. He's creating right

229
00:19:20,808 --> 00:19:22,895
now. I think we should just leave him be.

230
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:23,881
LAURA: Understandable.

231
00:19:23,881 --> 00:19:25,250
LIAM: Let him get it out of his system.

232
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,128
MARISHA: I'm really worried about him.

233
00:19:27,128 --> 00:19:28,523
SAM: Yes.

234
00:19:28,523 --> 00:19:38,042
ORION: Matthew? Rolling-- 12. I'm just trying to
teach my pet something but I rolled a 12.

235
00:19:38,042 --> 00:19:40,801
MATT: For?

236
00:19:40,801 --> 00:19:43,093
ORION: Oh, I want it to follow. To follow.

237
00:19:43,093 --> 00:19:53,100
MATT: To follow. Okay. You gather, based on the
recent intensity of trying to teach things to

238
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:58,891
Lockheed over the past week. You succeed in a few.
There is a bit of balking frustration that perhaps

239
00:19:58,891 --> 00:20:06,491
you've overstepped a little bit, and Lockheed
feels maybe there's less of a friendship here more

240
00:20:06,491 --> 00:20:10,828
than a real master-servant relationship, at least
in this moment, and does not seem to be receptive

241
00:20:10,828 --> 00:20:12,431
to your attempt.

242
00:20:12,431 --> 00:20:14,889
ORION: He's in a mood, also. Why is everybody in a
mood today?

243
00:20:14,889 --> 00:20:19,341
SAM: I know. Percy's hate-smelting downstairs.

244
00:20:19,341 --> 00:20:23,452
LAURA: Percy has good reason to hate-smelt. He
seems rather disturbed that the Briarwoods got

245
00:20:23,452 --> 00:20:24,463
away.

246
00:20:24,463 --> 00:20:27,335
SAM: Yes. I feel responsible.

247
00:20:27,335 --> 00:20:36,515
\MARISHA: Out of curiosity, did anyone else hear
him-- did anyone else just happen to hear what he

248
00:20:36,515 --> 00:20:39,312
said in that fight last night?

249
00:20:39,312 --> 00:20:47,428
LAURA: I was a little bit preoccupied by watching
him shoot a servant boy over and over and over

250
00:20:47,428 --> 00:20:48,741
again.

251
00:20:48,741 --> 00:20:50,800
MARISHA: It was after that, actually.

252
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,551
LAURA: What did he say?

253
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:57,230
MARISHA: Never mind.

254
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:00,727
SAM: What? No, spit it out. What did he say? It
seems important.

255
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:05,963
MARISHA: It's hard to say. You know Percy. I don't
know where he gets these lines.

256
00:21:05,963 --> 00:21:08,279
SAM: Is it fuck? Is it shit?

257
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:10,629
TRAVIS: Cock! Bulls! Dong! Wang!

258
00:21:10,629 --> 00:21:11,880
LIAM: Steampunk!

259
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,496
MARISHA: Jeez. Okay.

260
00:21:13,496 --> 00:21:14,919
TRAVIS: Donkey wang!

261
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:17,304
MARISHA: This is getting really off subject.

262
00:21:17,304 --> 00:21:19,559
ORION: I'm going to go down to my laboratory.

263
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:21,050
LAURA: What did he say?

264
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:32,920
MARISHA: It was when he was screaming the cluster
of things as he was shooting that mercenary in the

265
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:45,124
face, and he said, "What are you doing? You have
no reason to be here. Your soul is now forfeit."

266
00:21:45,124 --> 00:21:51,862
Really, that last part is the most important one.
The first stuff is fairly average. But yeah, "Your

267
00:21:51,862 --> 00:21:54,642
"soul is now forfeit."

268
00:21:54,642 --> 00:21:55,989
TRAVIS: It's a good line.

269
00:21:55,989 --> 00:21:57,400
LAURA: It's a really good line.

270
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,533
SAM: Thought he was just trash-talking. You think
there's more to it?

271
00:21:59,533 --> 00:22:08,866
MARISHA: I thought it was maybe a line and then it
seemed really aggressive and strong and specific,

272
00:22:08,866 --> 00:22:15,120
so it made me think a lot. I don't know.

273
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,999
LAURA: Did you ask him about it at all?

274
00:22:16,999 --> 00:22:18,955
MARISHA: We haven't seen him since that happened.

275
00:22:18,955 --> 00:22:20,514
TRAVIS: What do you think?

276
00:22:20,514 --> 00:22:27,513
LAURA: What, do you think his Pepperbox is--
what?

277
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:31,548
MARISHA: I think he's not telling us everything,
that's for sure.

278
00:22:31,548 --> 00:22:33,287
SAM: Well, we all have some secrets.

279
00:22:33,287 --> 00:22:41,550
MARISHA: Yeah. But screaming, "Your soul is now
forfeit?" That's not a secret. That's saying you

280
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,423
peed the bed when you were a kid.

281
00:22:43,423 --> 00:22:47,454
LIAM: I worry, too, but he did lose his entire
family.

282
00:22:47,454 --> 00:22:49,693
LAURA: He did pee the bed when he was a kid.

283
00:22:49,693 --> 00:22:51,066
MARISHA: Oh, really?

284
00:22:51,066 --> 00:22:55,844
LIAM: I am assuming. But he lost his entire family
to those people.

285
00:22:55,844 --> 00:23:01,365
MARISHA: Sure. But he wasn't screaming this at the
Briarwoods. He was screaming this at a random

286
00:23:01,365 --> 00:23:02,680
mercenary.

287
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,044
LAURA: Well?

288
00:23:04,044 --> 00:23:05,744
MARISHA: What does that mean?

289
00:23:05,744 --> 00:23:07,612
TRAVIS: Maybe his soul is forfeit.

290
00:23:07,612 --> 00:23:09,059
MARISHA: To what?

291
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:11,120
TRAVIS: Death?

292
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,119
LAURA: Maybe we keep an eye on Percy.

293
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:22,871
SAM: That's a fair point, though. We'll keep an
eye on him. He seems to be in a fragile state

294
00:23:22,871 --> 00:23:24,498
right now.

295
00:23:24,498 --> 00:23:27,563
LAURA: Percy's not the one who killed a poor old
woman, though.

296
00:23:27,563 --> 00:23:34,553
SAM: Did we kill her? I thought we just made her
sleep and then walked away.

297
00:23:34,553 --> 00:23:36,642
TRAVIS: Nope. No. Total massacre.

298
00:23:36,642 --> 00:23:39,043
LAURA: Tiberius destroyed her.

299
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:41,595
SAM: Tiberius, you killed an old woman?

300
00:23:41,595 --> 00:23:43,496
ORION: I'm not there.

301
00:23:43,496 --> 00:23:50,265
MARISHA: Yeah, that's actually another thing I
wanted to talk about. That was also really

302
00:23:50,265 --> 00:23:57,924
intense. You know, I get it. It was a hard day. It
was a hard day, and we tend to get a little

303
00:23:57,924 --> 00:24:05,810
aggressive sometimes after hard days. We've all
been there. But he didn't just murder an old

304
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:13,953
woman. He chainsawed her. A sleeping, unconscious
woman.

305
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:16,797
TRAVIS: It was pretty great!

306
00:24:16,797 --> 00:24:22,098
SAM: Are you saying that we should take it down a
notch? Or maybe not brutally destroy the bad

307
00:24:22,098 --> 00:24:23,435
guys?

308
00:24:23,435 --> 00:24:30,734
MARISHA: You also were the only other one who
seemed to be confused as to what was going on.

309
00:24:30,734 --> 00:24:39,627
LAURA: I shot her. I shot her in the back. Let's
be honest. I didn't chainsaw her, but I did shoot

310
00:24:39,627 --> 00:24:41,368
her in the back as she was running away.

311
00:24:41,368 --> 00:24:43,325
SAM: I made her go to sleep. That was peaceful.

312
00:24:43,325 --> 00:24:47,779
MARISHA: That's what I'm saying. That was good.
That was nice.

313
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:49,921
LAURA: I was aiming for her shoulder, if it
makes any difference.

314
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:53,480
TRAVIS: She did have that sweet little run, which
was so cute.

315
00:24:53,480 --> 00:25:00,802
SAM: Are you taking moral exception to some of our
behavior?

316
00:25:00,802 --> 00:25:05,750
MARISHA: That might exactly be what I'm saying.
Man, you see this is why I like you, Scanlan.

317
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:12,073
You're so much better at the words than me. I
don't think I even knew that's what I felt until

318
00:25:12,073 --> 00:25:13,624
you said it just now.

319
00:25:13,624 --> 00:25:22,770
SAM: Well, this is something perhaps you should
pray on and think on. If there's something you'd

320
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:27,167
like us to change about our behavior, we can
consider that. We're all friends. We're allies

321
00:25:27,167 --> 00:25:29,978
here. We should pay respect to you.

322
00:25:29,978 --> 00:25:33,024
MARISHA: I just don't want us to--

323
00:25:33,024 --> 00:25:39,297
LIAM: It's a fair point. We don't want to be
corrupted by the very evil that we mean to stamp

324
00:25:39,297 --> 00:25:46,551
out in this world. She was trying to kill us. But
your point is taken.

325
00:25:46,551 --> 00:25:50,066
MARISHA: She was a really old woman.

326
00:25:50,066 --> 00:25:53,833
LIAM: But she wasn't the secretary. She was trying
to kill.

327
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:56,656
MARISHA: Sure. But she was unconscious.

328
00:25:56,656 --> 00:25:58,928
TRAVIS: She actually didn't do anything, either.

329
00:25:58,928 --> 00:26:01,578
MARISHA: Yeah, she didn't really do anything at
all.

330
00:26:01,578 --> 00:26:03,078
TRAVIS: She could have been taking notes.

331
00:26:03,078 --> 00:26:04,683
LAURA: She had a wand!

332
00:26:04,683 --> 00:26:09,998
MARISHA: I'm not saying she wasn't a threat and
I'm not saying we shouldn't handle threats. I'm

333
00:26:09,998 --> 00:26:17,561
saying maybe we shouldn't dissect a woman with a
spinning Krull blade who's sleeping on the ground.

334
00:26:17,561 --> 00:26:22,612
Defenseless, running away. She was fleeing.

335
00:26:22,612 --> 00:26:27,681
SAM: All right. You know, this is constructive
criticism, and we'll take it as such. And I, for

336
00:26:27,681 --> 00:26:34,344
one, will maybe not desecrate and denigrate
bodies.

337
00:26:34,344 --> 00:26:37,693
LAURA: Just beds! And temples. (laughs)

338
00:26:37,693 --> 00:26:41,808
LIAM: I don't know! I mean, I see what Keyleth's
saying, but I don't really want to cramp your

339
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:43,429
style, Scanlan.

340
00:26:43,429 --> 00:26:47,476
SAM: Oh, I'll shit on things. Maybe not people.

341
00:26:47,476 --> 00:26:52,832
LIAM: We're like the A-Team, and that's your
specialty. I don't really want to-- See, you

342
00:26:52,832 --> 00:26:54,669
should just shit when you feel the urge.

343
00:26:54,669 --> 00:26:56,535
LAURA: What time is it? Do we need to be getting
to Uriel?

344
00:26:56,535 --> 00:26:57,931
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, what time is it?

345
00:26:57,931 --> 00:27:00,926
MATT: At this point, it's probably pushing on 11
am, close to noon.

346
00:27:00,926 --> 00:27:04,549
LAURA: We should probably be getting to the
palace.

347
00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:10,308
MATT: Tiberius, what did you say you were doing
down there? What did you say you were doing down

348
00:27:10,308 --> 00:27:12,437
in your laboratory?

349
00:27:12,437 --> 00:27:18,378
ORION: Well, I was doing my research on that stuff
last night and this morning.

350
00:27:18,378 --> 00:27:20,325
MATT: Your which one?

351
00:27:20,325 --> 00:27:23,965
ORION: It's just my ability because of my class. I
do the backstory.

352
00:27:23,965 --> 00:27:26,184
MATT: Your backstory is?

353
00:27:26,184 --> 00:27:29,953
ORION: I am a noble sage.

354
00:27:29,953 --> 00:27:32,609
MATT: Well, there's a noble and there's a sage.

355
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:39,734
ORION: Yeah, I know, and I spliced them because it
made sense. No. The noble part is the RP. The sage

356
00:27:39,734 --> 00:27:41,230
is the perk.

357
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:44,050
MATT: Okay. Gotcha. That's good to know. All
right.

358
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:50,807
ORION: And I was writing down the sigil to the
keep. That's completed.

359
00:27:50,807 --> 00:28:03,550
MATT: Okay. So the sigil is there for you. All
right. And so as the sage-- All right. Okay. So

360
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:08,978
yeah. Not difficult to research. There are a
number of books. They're older books and things

361
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:12,975
that were installed as part of the construction of
this laboratory for you, and information that you

362
00:28:12,975 --> 00:28:20,168
have gathered since. There are various bestiaries
and gatherings of information about the dangerous

363
00:28:20,168 --> 00:28:24,352
denizens in the countryside around you, and it is
a very dangerous place outside of the few points

364
00:28:24,352 --> 00:28:27,990
of civilized society that has built up its own
defenses.

365
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:33,767
Throughout the evening and the morning, you've
managed to find eventually a piece that talks

366
00:28:33,767 --> 00:28:40,298
about various undead entities and the process of
undeath, and necromantic magics that have been

367
00:28:40,298 --> 00:28:48,167
perverted throughout the generations to defy the
natural cycle of life. You do come across an entry

368
00:28:48,167 --> 00:28:55,469
about vampirism. It is extremely rare and was
largely thought abolished close to 200 years ago.

369
00:28:55,469 --> 00:29:02,565
There are very rare whispers of any sort of cases
out there, and usually as soon as something comes

370
00:29:02,565 --> 00:29:12,038
to any sort of public knowledge, large mobs gather
and whoever was infected with this horrible state

371
00:29:12,038 --> 00:29:14,355
was hunted down and killed.

372
00:29:14,355 --> 00:29:21,558
What you do learn from this is religious
symbology, while classically thought to have an

373
00:29:21,558 --> 00:29:26,649
effect on people afflicted with vampirism,
actually has no effect. It's more of a

374
00:29:26,649 --> 00:29:33,577
superstition, but does not actually have any
negative impact on the individual. However,

375
00:29:33,577 --> 00:29:46,010
certain things that do render a vampire easier to
destroy: the presence of sunlight. Anything that

376
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:50,537
counts as sunlight can damage them progressively
the longer they're in it, prevent them from

377
00:29:50,537 --> 00:29:56,405
restoring their health, and ultimately destroy
them and turn them to ash, should they be brought

378
00:29:56,405 --> 00:30:02,179
to the brink of death in the presence of sunlight.
Also, very quickly and consistently rushing

379
00:30:02,179 --> 00:30:11,856
water. Being held into a rushing stream or under a
waterfall would have a similar effect to sunlight.

380
00:30:11,856 --> 00:30:19,330
You do also know the stake in the heart is also
considered to be a way to destroy them. It does

381
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:24,149
not actually destroy them, but it does render them
paralyzed and has to be done when they're in their

382
00:30:24,149 --> 00:30:33,060
resting place, within their coffin and/or the dirt
that is considered their resting location. Usually

383
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:37,708
that is the beginning step: to find and locate
where the vampire is resting, stake in the heart,

384
00:30:37,708 --> 00:30:41,769
and then carry the body to sunlight or rushing
water. And that's how they're permanently

385
00:30:41,769 --> 00:30:45,681
destroyed. You also find out that if a vampire is
thought to be killed under any other

386
00:30:45,681 --> 00:30:51,158
circumstances, the body turns to mist and is nigh
invulnerable and eventually finds its way back to

387
00:30:51,158 --> 00:30:55,412
wherever they've hidden their resting place to
recover within a very short period of time, making

388
00:30:55,412 --> 00:30:59,864
them extremely dangerous, unless you have the
right situation, the right conditions, to bring

389
00:30:59,864 --> 00:31:02,679
them to that point. So that information is now at
your disposal.

390
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:05,835
ORION: Wonderful.

391
00:31:05,835 --> 00:31:09,873
TRAVIS: Do you want to tell us what you've
learned?

392
00:31:09,873 --> 00:31:23,356
ORION: I did it right this time! Knowing that, I
take some files and-- I want to check if I can--

393
00:31:23,356 --> 00:31:27,451
Nope. I can't do anything yet. That's it. I'm
going to go upstairs.

394
00:31:27,451 --> 00:31:34,538
MATT: Okay. So as you guys have gathered the time
and what you might be, going forward, doing for

395
00:31:34,538 --> 00:31:39,186
the rest of the day, Tiberius comes upstairs with
a bit of a smile and an air of confidence.

396
00:31:39,186 --> 00:31:40,693
LAURA: Oh good, you're back.

397
00:31:40,693 --> 00:31:47,777
LIAM: Tibs, we were just discussing the future of
the group and the direction we've been taking. And

398
00:31:47,777 --> 00:31:55,937
a point was introduced that maybe perhaps, we
started as a sort of a-- mercenary group is a bit

399
00:31:55,937 --> 00:32:02,631
strong-- but this alliance we have formed out of
convenience. We all needed to eat. But now that

400
00:32:02,631 --> 00:32:09,928
we're at the stature we are, in a keep, in Emon.
Friends to the emperor. We want to figure out what

401
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:15,398
we're doing here. Do we want to be just powerful
badasses who walk around getting what they want,

402
00:32:15,398 --> 00:32:21,354
or are we trying to enact some positive change in
this world?

403
00:32:21,354 --> 00:32:28,410
ORION: Yes, absolutely. That's what my items are
for. I've only found one of them. There are still

404
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:35,503
three or four, if they even exist out there. There
are countless things to go and venture forth and

405
00:32:35,503 --> 00:32:36,948
explore.

406
00:32:36,948 --> 00:32:38,492
TRAVIS: What? Your items?

407
00:32:38,492 --> 00:32:44,823
ORION: The artifacts, the Ring of Boros, the old
hag. That is the next step in my quest. She told

408
00:32:44,823 --> 00:32:47,332
us it would be in the Feywood. Right?

409
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:51,412
MATT: Feywild. Close. Researcher.

410
00:32:51,412 --> 00:33:03,110
ORION: That is where we need to go. But that's why
we ran into her in Vasselheim, and she

411
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:05,012
wouldn't tell me anything more.

412
00:33:05,012 --> 00:33:09,910
MARISHA: How do you plan to use your items? For
better good in the world?

413
00:33:10,065 --> 00:33:14,962
ORION: Well, you've seen how I've used my Mending
Wheel. Countless ways.

414
00:33:14,962 --> 00:33:19,584
TRAVIS: Yeah, thank you. You healed my cask. I'll
always be grateful.

415
00:33:19,584 --> 00:33:24,919
ORION: Moreover, it would prove to the council
that all of the things that I went on this journey

416
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:31,285
for to begin with, it was true. Or for naught. And
really, to gain the respect of my father and

417
00:33:31,285 --> 00:33:39,453
everyone else. You don't know how hard it is to be
a chromatic dragon in a metallic world! It's not

418
00:33:39,453 --> 00:33:40,417
easy.

419
00:33:40,417 --> 00:33:45,438
LIAM: Well, there's no question that you are an
invaluable member of Vox Machina, and our friend,

420
00:33:45,438 --> 00:33:47,622
and our family. And that is not in question.

421
00:33:47,622 --> 00:33:55,307
ORION: Of course. Which is why I have pledged my
loyalty to you all. And I need your strength, as

422
00:33:55,307 --> 00:34:00,046
well. There is no way I could accomplish in my
mission alone. I mean, Grog, when I ran into you

423
00:34:00,046 --> 00:34:06,037
in that one bar. How many men were you beating up?
I counted eight, if I recall.

424
00:34:06,037 --> 00:34:07,398
TRAVIS: I think that sounds right.

425
00:34:07,398 --> 00:34:08,799
SAM: He can't count.

426
00:34:08,799 --> 00:34:10,251
TRAVIS: It's that many.

427
00:34:10,251 --> 00:34:17,267
ORION: Here was this brute who I would have ran
away from, but here you were, and I found you to

428
00:34:17,267 --> 00:34:23,762
be rather charming. I figured, well, that's some
good company to keep, rather. And then I met the

429
00:34:23,762 --> 00:34:26,514
rest of you, and look where we are now!

430
00:34:26,514 --> 00:34:31,690
LAURA: Yes. Tiberius, the point of this is you
killed an old woman last night, very brutally.

431
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:34,297
Please maybe don't do that again.

432
00:34:34,297 --> 00:34:38,501
ORION: She felt nothing, but of course. And I was
giving my new Krull blade a good old try.

433
00:34:38,501 --> 00:34:44,314
LAURA: Yes, you were. Maybe not on sleeping people
anymore. People who are actually attacking us.

434
00:34:44,314 --> 00:34:47,254
ORION: She was-- okay, fine.

435
00:34:47,254 --> 00:34:59,286
LIAM: Well, I think the point is your abilities in
arcane wonder are expanding daily. Exponentially.

436
00:34:59,286 --> 00:35:04,878
And perhaps be a little tentative. Do a little
practice run in the woods on your own, once in

437
00:35:04,878 --> 00:35:08,999
a while, and see what the effects are before you go
whipping it out.

438
00:35:08,999 --> 00:35:10,982
ORION: Are there woods nearby?

439
00:35:10,982 --> 00:35:18,722
SAM: This is an intervention. We love you very
much, but you killed an old lady.

440
00:35:18,722 --> 00:35:20,659
TRAVIS: I like the way you kill people.

441
00:35:20,659 --> 00:35:22,508
ORION: Well, yes.

442
00:35:22,508 --> 00:35:24,744
LAURA: We're all on the up and up now, right?

443
00:35:24,744 --> 00:35:28,138
ORION: One raises a hand to me or Vox Machina,
they are going to die.

444
00:35:28,138 --> 00:35:29,788
TRAVIS: Yeah! Yeah, they are!

445
00:35:29,788 --> 00:35:33,059
ORION: It is simple. I do not know why this is a
discussion. I won't be as cruel--

446
00:35:33,059 --> 00:35:40,192
MARISHA: You know, she didn't even really do
anything. She was really old.

447
00:35:40,192 --> 00:35:41,807
LAURA: She was attacking us.

448
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:43,226
LIAM: Keyleth.

449
00:35:43,226 --> 00:35:44,715
MARISHA: What?

450
00:35:44,715 --> 00:35:50,796
LIAM: Clearly, we all love you as family, and
nobody blames you, but you once killed a child,

451
00:35:50,796 --> 00:35:52,954
and none of us blame you for that.

452
00:35:52,954 --> 00:35:56,373
TRAVIS: Is it too early to start drinking? I pull
out the cask of ale.

453
00:35:56,373 --> 00:35:58,652
LIAM: And that happened in the heat of battle.

454
00:35:58,652 --> 00:36:04,423
MARISHA: You know, I'm really sensitive about
that, Vax. I'm <i>really</i> sensitive about that,

455
00:36:04,423 --> 00:36:05,425
Vax!

456
00:36:05,425 --> 00:36:06,825
LIAM: I'm well aware.

457
00:36:06,825 --> 00:36:10,377
MARISHA: And that was different.

458
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:12,456
LAURA: It was an accident!

459
00:36:12,456 --> 00:36:16,134
MARISHA: That was pretty fucking deliberate, what
he did.

460
00:36:16,134 --> 00:36:21,472
ORION: Yes, to someone who was opposing us. That
was a child who was innocent. Or was he opposing

461
00:36:21,472 --> 00:36:23,309
us, too? I don't remember, actually.

462
00:36:23,309 --> 00:36:25,094
LIAM: And it all falls apart.

463
00:36:25,094 --> 00:36:28,293
MARISHA: He was being puppeted by sorcerer Michael
Jackson.

464
00:36:28,293 --> 00:36:36,580
LIAM: No one agrees with you today more than I,
and I think we can adjust our perspective

465
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,074
slightly. Right, Grog?

466
00:36:38,074 --> 00:36:39,732
TRAVIS: What's the word?

467
00:36:39,732 --> 00:36:41,039
LIAM: See?

468
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:42,794
SAM: Kill softer.

469
00:36:42,794 --> 00:36:46,440
ORION: I'll show you how. You just have to do it
really slow.

470
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,147
LAURA: Uriel's waiting for us.

471
00:36:50,147 --> 00:36:57,836
SAM: Let's table this. We'll stick a pin in this
discussion. We'll all be thinking long and hard

472
00:36:57,836 --> 00:36:58,849
about this.

473
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:00,933
LAURA: Keyleth, it wasn't intentional and
everybody knows that.

474
00:37:00,933 --> 00:37:02,928
LIAM: Absolutely. Not intentional. No.

475
00:37:02,928 --> 00:37:06,143
MARISHA: I turn into Minxie and start walking.

476
00:37:06,143 --> 00:37:10,512
TRAVIS: Minxie! I go and give a little scratch
behind the ears.

477
00:37:10,512 --> 00:37:13,474
MATT: You guys gather and make your way into the
city of Emon proper.

478
00:37:13,474 --> 00:37:20,494
LAURA: Actually, before we head towards Uriel, we
probably should-- do we have any sort of proof

479
00:37:20,494 --> 00:37:25,176
that the Briarwoods actually did horrible things
and it wasn't us attacking them?

480
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:27,524
LIAM: Well, I've got these little scars right
here.

481
00:37:27,524 --> 00:37:31,329
MATT: The scars are still there. They're still
wounds that are healing.

482
00:37:31,329 --> 00:37:38,503
LAURA: All right. Cool. Just making sure that we
had something.

483
00:37:38,503 --> 00:37:41,473
LIAM: And then there was what's-his-name, Awesome
Pants, who was there.

484
00:37:41,473 --> 00:37:43,227
LAURA: Seeker Asum.

485
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:45,059
ORION: Allura saw everything, as well.

486
00:37:45,059 --> 00:37:46,719
SAM: Did she see the fight?

487
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:48,324
LAURA: Allura didn't see the fight.

488
00:37:48,324 --> 00:37:55,034
LIAM: We know she knows what's up, but whether she
can be used as a reliable witness is-- we've got

489
00:37:55,034 --> 00:37:57,424
multiple witnesses.

490
00:37:57,424 --> 00:38:01,228
SAM: There were those guards, too. There was
guards outside the door.

491
00:38:01,228 --> 00:38:02,927
LIAM: They were incinerated.

492
00:38:02,927 --> 00:38:04,261
SAM: Oh yeah.

493
00:38:04,261 --> 00:38:06,409
LAURA: Plus, they were the Briarwoods' guards,
anyway.

494
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:08,070
ORION: One of them was still alive. I didn't kill
both of them.

495
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:10,229
LAURA: He went away with the Briarwoods, I'm going
to assume.

496
00:38:10,229 --> 00:38:13,964
TRAVIS: What a dick! We go to see Uriel.

497
00:38:13,964 --> 00:38:15,624
MATT: Okay.

498
00:38:15,624 --> 00:38:20,462
TRAVIS: I made a choice for the team!

499
00:38:20,462 --> 00:38:24,313
(laughter)

500
00:38:24,313 --> 00:38:29,982
MATT: As you're having this discussion, all of you
make your way into the city of Emon, across the

501
00:38:29,982 --> 00:38:34,292
districts to the Cloudtop. You're greeted and let
within the gate into the central district there.

502
00:38:34,292 --> 00:38:40,506
You make your way to the palace of Tal'Dorei,
through the front doors. The guards that are there

503
00:38:40,506 --> 00:38:46,947
lead you in and one of them says, "Uriel is
waiting within the throne chamber." You guys are

504
00:38:46,947 --> 00:38:49,552
led down the main hallway into the very center of
the palace.

505
00:38:49,552 --> 00:38:51,964
MARISHA: I come out of Minxie.

506
00:38:51,964 --> 00:38:57,605
MATT: The nervous guard, thankfully, puts his
weapon away and is like, "Oh! Lady Keyleth, my

507
00:38:57,605 --> 00:38:59,941
"apologies." And puts his spear to the side.

508
00:38:59,941 --> 00:39:02,142
LAURA: Trinket's still here, though.

509
00:39:02,142 --> 00:39:09,059
LIAM: I buzz over to that specific guard and say,
do you have a lost and found here? I have this

510
00:39:09,059 --> 00:39:15,920
really badass serpent-style belt. Sometimes it
crawls around on its own. Sometimes it's just a

511
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:21,429
belt. And I lost it here the other night. And I'm
really hoping-- I mean, it ties everything

512
00:39:21,429 --> 00:39:24,569
together. Is there anyone I can check with?

513
00:39:24,569 --> 00:39:31,458
MATT: "Check back after you've spoken with the
Sovereign, please. Thank you." Leads you guys on.

514
00:39:31,458 --> 00:39:35,713
As you head down the main hallway-- and you recall
this hallway. This was a long, dangerous trek the

515
00:39:35,713 --> 00:39:39,449
first time you came to the palace. This was where
Uriel's family was possessed. This is where you

516
00:39:39,449 --> 00:39:45,316
had your battle with the glabrezu. This is where
Pike was slain. This is where you had to pull the

517
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:50,218
shadows from the bodies of his family. This is a
very emotional place that you really haven't been

518
00:39:50,218 --> 00:39:58,832
to since that sequence of events. Walking in
already has this tenuous state of low-simmering

519
00:39:58,832 --> 00:40:03,958
energy. As you're brought into the main chamber,
you can see there is the dual thrones for Uriel

520
00:40:03,958 --> 00:40:07,432
and his wife. His wife is not present; his family
is not present, just Uriel sitting on the throne.

521
00:40:07,432 --> 00:40:12,578
There are a few guards on the different entrances
to the room. As you walk in, Uriel just sits there

522
00:40:12,578 --> 00:40:18,371
on the throne and gives you acknowledgment and
ushers you into the room. You all step in. Trinket

523
00:40:18,371 --> 00:40:22,845
behind you keeping an eye out. Like a bear is wont
to do.

524
00:40:22,845 --> 00:40:30,408
You guys make your way up towards the very edge of
the central raised dais where the thrones are

525
00:40:30,408 --> 00:40:38,332
currently set up on. You now see on the opposite
side of the room, Seeker Asum and Allura walk in,

526
00:40:38,332 --> 00:40:45,654
as well as Arbiter Brom, who is the cleric that is
the Master of Law in the city. They walk up and

527
00:40:45,654 --> 00:40:52,020
flank the sides of the throne, stepping back a
little bit to not gather all the attention, but

528
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:59,881
definitely be there as a show of support. As they
enter, the doors on the other side of the room and the

529
00:40:59,881 --> 00:41:07,821
door behind you open, and roughly 30 guards enter
the chamber quietly. They all filter in, blocking

530
00:41:07,821 --> 00:41:14,826
all the exits. The doors close. No weapons are
drawn, but there is a very strong showing of

531
00:41:14,826 --> 00:41:18,500
muscle in this room that you weren't expecting for
this meeting.

532
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:24,599
Once all the guards are settled and a really
awkward silence hits the room, Uriel stands up

533
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:34,263
from the throne and looks upon you. Pacing
slightly, back and forth. "Thank you all for

534
00:41:34,263 --> 00:41:42,869
"joining me. I must say, I am troubled by recent
events, and I wish to speak to you regarding them

535
00:41:42,869 --> 00:41:51,651
"before taking any action. I owe you that much for
all you've done for me. Before you left for

536
00:41:51,651 --> 00:42:01,372
"Vasselheim, you showed immediate interest in the
Briarwoods. Percy in-- Where is Percival?"

537
00:42:01,372 --> 00:42:12,280
SAM: Well, he's not feeling well today after the
events of last night, so he stayed behind.

538
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:22,723
MATT: "Well, then please relay this conversation
to him as soon as you see him. You exhibited

539
00:42:22,723 --> 00:42:28,469
"interest in the Briarwoods before leaving for
Vasselheim. I, through trust, did not inquire as

540
00:42:28,469 --> 00:42:34,232
"to why. But upon your return, eagerly told you
they were coming to this feast and invited you as

541
00:42:34,232 --> 00:42:39,078
"part of the Council of Tal'Dorei to join this
feast, as it was your request. I graciously

542
00:42:39,078 --> 00:42:45,302
"followed through. You showed up. A meal was had.
Questions were asked, although curious ones; I did

543
00:42:45,302 --> 00:42:55,831
"not pry. Now I have since been notified, and seen
a bit of the aftermath, that you, Vox Machina,

544
00:42:55,831 --> 00:43:07,153
"seemingly attacked our guests shortly-- please.
Listen. Attacked our guests shortly after the meal

545
00:43:07,153 --> 00:43:13,754
"in their own guest quarters. Forcing them to flee,
after you destroyed the hallway, ruined their

546
00:43:13,754 --> 00:43:22,611
"carriage, murdered two of their guards, two more
outside, and leaving Seeker Asum to witness this

547
00:43:22,611 --> 00:43:30,700
"entire process." Asum gives a nod. "You then
tortured their carriage driver, requested he be

548
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:36,081
"sent to the dungeon beneath your keep. And upon my
sentries returning from Greyskull to deliver him,

549
00:43:36,081 --> 00:43:43,084
"they find a freshly murdered old woman not far
behind the path you took. Not long after, Seeker

550
00:43:43,084 --> 00:43:48,852
"Asum found me and corroborated most of this
unexpected, violent behavior. I then asked Arbiter

551
00:43:48,852 --> 00:43:54,775
"Brom here to divine the nature of this murder. And
through his divine sight, through the goddess

552
00:43:54,775 --> 00:44:00,923
"Ioun, comes to tell me it was none other than you,
Tiberius, that slaughtered this elderly woman

553
00:44:00,923 --> 00:44:02,738
"while she slept."

554
00:44:02,738 --> 00:44:05,195
ORION: Yes!

555
00:44:05,195 --> 00:44:10,734
MATT: "Now, I am quite disturbed by the events of
these past 14 hours, and I would like to hear an

556
00:44:10,734 --> 00:44:17,289
"explanation. Arbiter, if you could please, prepare
the space." Arbiter Brom steps forward and

557
00:44:17,289 --> 00:44:22,196
pulls forth from underneath his robes a necklace
that contains a holy symbol. The same symbol you

558
00:44:22,196 --> 00:44:30,343
saw across the temple beneath the Slayer's Take,
an eye-like inscription of the god Ioun. Brom

559
00:44:30,343 --> 00:44:37,139
grasps it, looks about you all, and prepares this
slight hand gesture, and you feel a slight tingle

560
00:44:37,139 --> 00:44:39,460
across the skin that lasts a few seconds.

561
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:41,773
MARISHA: Can I recognize the spell he's casting?

562
00:44:41,773 --> 00:44:44,864
MATT: I'll say go ahead and make a-- this would be
a religion check.

563
00:44:44,864 --> 00:44:52,918
MARISHA: He's doing a cleric thing, yeah? Seven.

564
00:44:52,918 --> 00:45:00,544
MATT: All right. Unable to ascertain the nature.
However, the incantation completes. No seeming

565
00:45:00,544 --> 00:45:07,999
noticeable effect. Brom nods and steps back in the
line of the thrones. I want all of you guys to

566
00:45:07,999 --> 00:45:10,538
roll charisma saving throws.

567
00:45:10,538 --> 00:45:15,095
MARISHA: Son of a bitch. Always a problem.

568
00:45:15,095 --> 00:45:21,747
ORION: 19.

569
00:45:21,747 --> 00:45:23,309
MARISHA: 11.

570
00:45:23,309 --> 00:45:29,215
SAM: I get advantage, and I rolled a 27.

571
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:31,772
MATT: (laughs) Okay. Bards.

572
00:45:31,772 --> 00:45:33,132
LIAM: 19.

573
00:45:33,132 --> 00:45:34,640
LAURA: 13.

574
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,965
TRAVIS: 18.

575
00:45:35,965 --> 00:45:45,212
MATT: All right. Good to know. Uriel then looks to
the rest of you. "So. I've said my piece for the

576
00:45:45,212 --> 00:45:47,795
"moment. Explain."

577
00:45:47,795 --> 00:45:49,720
LIAM: I step forward.

578
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:57,859
MARISHA: Can I do a quick insight check on Asum to
see if I can still recognize if he's still

579
00:45:57,859 --> 00:46:01,134
affected by the mind-control thing?

580
00:46:01,134 --> 00:46:04,562
MATT: Go ahead and make an insight check, sure.

581
00:46:04,562 --> 00:46:09,989
MARISHA: Ooh yeah! 28.

582
00:46:09,989 --> 00:46:18,159
MATT: Glancing at Asum, the way he's looking at
you and the general tension and feeling of the

583
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:28,617
room, you gather that Asum is not his normal self
completely. You step forward.

584
00:46:28,617 --> 00:46:37,532
LIAM: Uriel. With all respect, I needn't remind
you what the group of people before you put

585
00:46:37,532 --> 00:46:43,499
themselves through on your behalf and your
family's behalf. We almost lost one of our own.

586
00:46:43,499 --> 00:46:50,474
And if that counts for nothing here, then nothing
makes sense. But if that is not enough, let us

587
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:53,251
start here.

588
00:46:53,251 --> 00:47:01,481
ORION: The Briarwoods are vampires. And that old
lady, who was a butthole by the way, was with this

589
00:47:01,481 --> 00:47:04,362
demonoid person who we had to fight as well.

590
00:47:04,362 --> 00:47:13,095
LIAM: One thing at a time. That's true, but one
thing at a time. We had prior knowledge of the

591
00:47:13,095 --> 00:47:20,544
Briarwoods' intentions before this evening. And I
myself went to spy on them.

592
00:47:20,544 --> 00:47:28,591
LAURA: Here's the thing. Percy doesn't like them
because they killed his family. They took over his

593
00:47:28,591 --> 00:47:38,555
home, after killing his family. He got away. He
knows they're scary. We're trying to protect you.

594
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:43,554
ORION: So the point is, we all know how dangerous
it is that the knowledge of vampire existence and

595
00:47:43,554 --> 00:47:50,201
the spreading of those vile creatures. And now we
know they do exist. So however the means that that

596
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:54,884
came about is neither here nor there. We know
where they are.

597
00:47:54,884 --> 00:48:00,346
TRAVIS: And if you're wondering how we know
they're vampires-- (whispering) Vax, this is your

598
00:48:00,346 --> 00:48:01,446
cue.

599
00:48:01,446 --> 00:48:12,571
LIAM: I will subject myself to any test, to any
wizard or mage in this city who you know can

600
00:48:12,571 --> 00:48:18,659
ascertain the truth. To look through my eyes, to
see my memories. I don't know shit about magic,

601
00:48:18,659 --> 00:48:20,444
but there are people who do.

602
00:48:20,444 --> 00:48:28,723
SAM: Cleric Tristan also treated him last night
for his vampire-inflicted wound. I know this all

603
00:48:28,723 --> 00:48:34,106
looks really bad on the surface, and we did not
want to cause any disturbance within these

604
00:48:34,106 --> 00:48:42,549
hallowed walls, but there was a danger, we acted.
Perhaps too abruptly and without telling you.

605
00:48:42,549 --> 00:48:47,960
LAURA: We tried to get your attention. I called
for you immediately. As soon as we knew there was

606
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,255
danger.

607
00:48:49,255 --> 00:48:53,056
LIAM: And don't take our word for it. Anyone, have
them look in here.

608
00:48:53,056 --> 00:48:55,533
ORION: Actually, you take a Stormwind's word for--

609
00:48:55,533 --> 00:49:09,081
MATT: "Silence! Silence. You're in my court now,
Stormwind. You put so much weight upon this trust,

610
00:49:09,081 --> 00:49:14,598
"and you have done a good service. But also I've
heard whispers that you've thrown this trust

611
00:49:14,598 --> 00:49:20,841
"around in many circles. Remember, we held a parade
in your honor; we spread the word of the good

612
00:49:20,841 --> 00:49:26,918
"deeds you've done. We, at our own costs of Emon,
built you a keep, a home, at great expense, to

613
00:49:26,918 --> 00:49:35,526
"show thanks. And also, I believed, upon allowing
you to join the council, put us square. I owe you

614
00:49:35,526 --> 00:49:38,444
"nothing. Just as you owe me nothing."

615
00:49:38,444 --> 00:49:40,369
LIAM: Do you not want the truth?

616
00:49:40,369 --> 00:49:46,159
MATT: "I want the truth, but I also want you to
understand the stakes that are here and why there

617
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:54,277
"is this question. As the leader of this-- not this
city, but this entire countryside, I have to be

618
00:49:54,277 --> 00:50:01,728
"sure, and this is not the first time I have been
lied to by very close, trusted people, so I have

619
00:50:01,728 --> 00:50:03,138
"to be thorough."

620
00:50:03,138 --> 00:50:10,890
LIAM: This is why I offer myself completely into
your control and put myself under your supervision

621
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:17,531
and any user of the arcane arts you want to 
peer inside my mind, let them step up to the

622
00:50:17,531 --> 00:50:19,812
plate, because I have nothing to hide.

623
00:50:19,812 --> 00:50:26,157
LAURA: Also, while you are inquiring about him,
you might inquire about Seeker Asum.

624
00:50:26,157 --> 00:50:30,500
SAM: If you're worried about lies within your own
ranks, I think you should start with him.

625
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:36,681
MARISHA: In fact, I actually might be able to help
Seeker Asum, if you will allow me to.

626
00:50:36,681 --> 00:50:38,180
SAM: Help him?

627
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:42,113
MATT: You glance over at Asum, and Asum gives a
look to Uriel and Uriel--

628
00:50:42,113 --> 00:50:45,238
LAURA: He was mind-controlled last night.

629
00:50:45,238 --> 00:50:54,756
MATT: "I have had Asum at my side for the better
part of 15 years. He is responsible, far more than

630
00:50:54,756 --> 00:51:01,586
"your merry band has ever attempted, for keeping
and maintaining the good and lawful state of this

631
00:51:01,586 --> 00:51:02,490
"country."

632
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:15,003
LIAM: Uriel, your own family was not themselves!
And you know that! Look into my mind! Now! Today!

633
00:51:15,003 --> 00:51:17,733
You don't need to guess anything.

634
00:51:17,733 --> 00:51:32,422
MATT: "It would also do you well to show respect.
We are speaking, half-elf. Now, I would assign

635
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:40,940
"Allura to such an endeavor. However, it has also
been noticed that she has grown quite friendly and

636
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:49,702
"attached to your group, and in this circumstance,
there is question. So you will be, in a few days,

637
00:51:49,702 --> 00:51:53,499
"assigned an individual to this ritual of which you
are presenting yourself."

638
00:51:53,499 --> 00:51:55,616
MARISHA: Uriel, please--

639
00:51:55,616 --> 00:52:07,981
MATT: "Shh. The Briarwoods, regardless of what
you may think they may be, or we do-- that will

640
00:52:07,981 --> 00:52:15,974
"show in time-- have shown nothing over the past
five years but graciousness, and gone through all

641
00:52:15,974 --> 00:52:21,696
"proper channels to establish this relationship
between our city and theirs. Far more than the

642
00:52:21,696 --> 00:52:24,320
"previous family ever attempted."

643
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:32,432
LIAM: Well, one may smile and smile and still be a
villain.

644
00:52:32,432 --> 00:52:38,961
MATT: "That goes both ways. Now, please."

645
00:52:38,961 --> 00:52:49,964
MARISHA: Just let me do a quick restoration spell
on Asum. If nothing is wrong with him, nothing

646
00:52:49,964 --> 00:52:59,705
will happen. It's harmless. It's like taking
medicine when you're not sick. It can't hurt. And

647
00:52:59,705 --> 00:53:10,395
if I am wrong, then we can continue on. We can
have Vax tested. Please, it'll take ten minutes.

648
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:12,029
What can it hurt?

649
00:53:12,029 --> 00:53:16,229
LAURA: Up until last night, he was himself. Trust
us that now he is not.

650
00:53:16,229 --> 00:53:17,757
MARISHA: He came to us.

651
00:53:17,757 --> 00:53:24,020
MATT: "There has been nothing about his behavior,
at all, to insinuate any change of anything of the

652
00:53:24,166 --> 00:53:32,725
"sort. And I have known the man for quite some
time, before I even took this throne. However, I

653
00:53:32,725 --> 00:53:39,480
"will, in the good graces and the relationship we
forged, allow this. Asum, are you all right with

654
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,347
"this?"

655
00:53:40,347 --> 00:53:46,054
Asum gives a nod. "Well, if this is to be how it
is. Certainly." And he steps forward. The halfling

656
00:53:46,054 --> 00:53:51,678
approaches you, looking you in the face. All
right. You would like to attempt your Greater

657
00:53:51,678 --> 00:53:53,279
Restoration spell?

658
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:57,879
MARISHA: First, I meditate for a second, and I
cast Enhance Ability on myself.

659
00:53:57,879 --> 00:54:02,861
MATT: As a note, as you begin casting, you notice
the guards all go for their weapons and ready

660
00:54:02,861 --> 00:54:08,407
themselves, uncertain of what's about to
transpire. There is a tension in the room based on

661
00:54:08,407 --> 00:54:11,671
what this is going to be.

662
00:54:11,671 --> 00:54:15,812
MARISHA: Can I get some meditation music,
Scanlan?

663
00:54:15,812 --> 00:54:32,894
SAM: Oh! (chanting)

664
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:35,195
MATT: All right. So first you cast Enhance Ability
on yourself.

665
00:54:35,195 --> 00:54:37,582
MARISHA: Am I maybe inspired by that?

666
00:54:37,582 --> 00:54:46,398
MATT: Sure. In the tension of the room, this slow
droning hum of the gnome, which you can notice

667
00:54:46,398 --> 00:54:53,230
some of the guards look at each other, confused.
And Asum puts his hand up like, hold off.

668
00:54:53,230 --> 00:54:55,809
LIAM: It's Tuvan throat singing.

669
00:54:55,809 --> 00:55:02,760
MATT: All right. So first you cast Enhance
Ability on your--

670
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,252
MARISHA: Self.

671
00:55:04,252 --> 00:55:06,177
SAM: What ability?

672
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:16,949
MARISHA: To enhance wisdom? Wisdom.

673
00:55:16,949 --> 00:55:26,715
MATT: Okay. You reach out with Greater
Restoration. You complete the ritual. You touch

674
00:55:26,715 --> 00:55:35,836
onto the arms of Asum. It fades, and you see in
his eyes there's a moment of clarity and an

675
00:55:35,836 --> 00:55:45,260
inhale. A slight gasp, like some realization hits
him and his expression changes and looks towards

676
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:53,562
you and just goes-- He puts his hands out like
this for a moment, just trying to almost tell you

677
00:55:53,562 --> 00:55:58,539
something. Go ahead and make a wisdom check. Just
a d20. Or no, make an insight. Make a straight

678
00:55:58,539 --> 00:56:00,961
insight. This is more of an insight roll here.

679
00:56:00,961 --> 00:56:04,700
MARISHA: Okay. Oh! 29.

680
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:10,761
MATT: You get the sense through the subtlety of
physical motion and expression, Asum is telling

681
00:56:10,761 --> 00:56:21,343
you, just go with me on this. He steps back into
the place next to the throne. There's a brief

682
00:56:21,343 --> 00:56:26,740
moment of pause. Uriel says, "And, Asum?"

683
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:32,944
Asum goes, "My stance has not changed. I know not
what she is attempting or thought the situation

684
00:56:32,944 --> 00:56:38,751
"was, but it appears to me that this was either
misinformation or at least at the time being,

685
00:56:38,751 --> 00:56:43,455
"hopefully, not a lie. But I believe Brom has taken
care of that, yes?"

686
00:56:43,455 --> 00:56:46,897
And Brom gives a nod. "I certainly have hoped
to."

687
00:56:46,897 --> 00:57:03,253
Uriel goes, "Hm. All right. Here's the
circumstance: as it stands, I fear I must revoke

688
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:10,201
"Vox Machina's membership in the council of
Tal'Dorei until further notice, for the safety of

689
00:57:10,201 --> 00:57:19,291
"our countryside and the current tension in our
relationship."

690
00:57:19,291 --> 00:57:27,057
SAM: Objection! That's it. I just wanted to say
that. Please continue. I just want it noted that

691
00:57:27,057 --> 00:57:29,524
we object strongly to this.

692
00:57:29,524 --> 00:57:37,267
MATT: "I understand. And this will only continue
until all of our investigations are complete."

693
00:57:37,267 --> 00:57:45,093
SAM: Are we still allowed free rein to roam about
as we please? Are we under arrest for anything?

694
00:57:45,093 --> 00:57:50,529
MATT: "You are not under arrest. You are revoked
from the council, and you will be closely watched

695
00:57:50,529 --> 00:57:53,232
"until our investigations are complete."

696
00:57:53,232 --> 00:57:56,530
LAURA: How long will your investigations take?

697
00:57:56,530 --> 00:58:03,528
MATT: He looks back to Asum and Asum says, "Well,
depends on how quickly we can acquire the

698
00:58:03,528 --> 00:58:08,686
"information; it could be weeks. I'll do my best to
make it thorough and quick."

699
00:58:08,686 --> 00:58:11,135
LAURA: Are we allowed to leave the city in that
time?

700
00:58:11,135 --> 00:58:17,695
MATT: Uriel looks back and says, "You may leave if
you wish. Know that there have been precautions

701
00:58:17,695 --> 00:58:22,494
"taken. Should you attempt to flee, we will find
you."

702
00:58:22,494 --> 00:58:24,863
LIAM: And when are you to look into my mind?

703
00:58:24,863 --> 00:58:27,956
LAURA: Weirdo!

704
00:58:27,956 --> 00:58:31,651
(laughter)

705
00:58:31,651 --> 00:58:33,578
LIAM: It freaking ends here. Right away.

706
00:58:33,578 --> 00:58:35,394
TRAVIS: Can you read my mind?

707
00:58:35,394 --> 00:58:36,999
LIAM: There is no spoon.

708
00:58:36,999 --> 00:58:44,525
MATT: "We ought to speak to the Lyceum to find a
proper individual of sufficient power and trust to

709
00:58:44,525 --> 00:58:50,297
"do this, as Allura right now is being kept out of
the scenario."

710
00:58:50,297 --> 00:58:54,359
SAM: Are we allowed to speak with Allura?

711
00:58:54,359 --> 00:59:01,805
MATT: "If you wish. Outside of these chambers. Do
what you must to clear your name. I would like

712
00:59:01,805 --> 00:59:10,646
"very much for this all to be true, what you're
saying. But do not flee. Do not give an

"inclination that you attempt to escape this
judgment, for we will take that as a sign of

714

"guilt."

715
00:59:16,186 --> 00:59:18,857
LIAM: We've no intention of going anywhere.

716
00:59:18,857 --> 00:59:23,370
MATT: "Should we conclude that your actions were
beyond reason and the moral fiber of this council

717
00:59:23,370 --> 00:59:29,922
"before your return, we will have no choice to put
a bounty on your heads, should you not return. I

718
00:59:29,922 --> 00:59:36,649
"really, really do not wish to do this. Do not make
me do this."

719
00:59:36,649 --> 00:59:40,617
ORION: I stand up. "No need for threats, friend.
Are we done here?"

720
00:59:40,617 --> 00:59:48,101
MATT: "I want to believe you all. I ask you, show
that my trust has not been misplaced all this

721
00:59:48,101 --> 00:59:51,723
"time. Now, you may leave."

722
00:59:51,723 --> 00:59:56,294
SAM: I look forward to the second parade you'll
throw for us after our names are cleared.

723
00:59:56,294 --> 00:59:58,993
MATT: "Very well."

724
00:59:58,993 --> 01:00:05,513
TRAVIS: I turn to the guards that were grabbing at
their weapons and I flex real fast at them and

725
01:00:05,513 --> 01:00:06,502
then I walk.

726
01:00:06,502 --> 01:00:08,083
MATT: Four of them go, (yelps).

727
01:00:08,083 --> 01:00:09,034
TRAVIS: Bitch!

728
01:00:09,034 --> 01:00:12,104
(laughter)

729
01:00:12,104 --> 01:00:19,502
MATT: As you guys go back out the doors that you
entered, the guards now a little closely following

730
01:00:19,502 --> 01:00:26,021
as you exit, leading you out of the palace, down
the front steps, and essentially stand at the

731
01:00:26,021 --> 01:00:27,634
front of the palace gates.

732
01:00:27,634 --> 01:00:32,683
LIAM: I'm sorry. I was just talking to one of your
friends. Have you seen a belt that is shaped like

733
01:00:32,683 --> 01:00:37,669
a snake? Sometimes it moves around on its own. And
it answers to the name Simon, but usually it's

734
01:00:37,669 --> 01:00:43,071
just a belt and looks really cool. Have you seen
it? Is there a lost and found I can check out?

735
01:00:43,071 --> 01:00:44,813
It's very dear to me.

736
01:00:44,813 --> 01:00:49,819
MATT: The guard just looks for a second and goes,
"I think you've got more important matters to deal

737
01:00:49,819 --> 01:00:52,466
"with before you go looking for a belt, sir."

738
01:00:52,466 --> 01:00:57,658
LIAM: Where's that other guy? He was more
receptive to this. Do I see that other guy?

739
01:00:57,658 --> 01:01:00,751
LAURA: Darling. Seriously.

740
01:01:00,751 --> 01:01:04,022
MATT: The guards all turn around and start
ascending the stairs.

741
01:01:04,022 --> 01:01:08,159
LIAM: It's on all the fan art. It really makes
sense to have it on me.

742
01:01:08,159 --> 01:01:10,516
MATT: They don't appear to be listening.

743
01:01:10,516 --> 01:01:16,918
LIAM: Keep an eye out for it. 100 gold to any chap
who finds it and holds onto it for me.

744
01:01:16,918 --> 01:01:22,219
MATT: Two of them stop in their step for a second
and then keep walking.

745
01:01:22,219 --> 01:01:23,604
LIAM: I'm a nice guy!

746
01:01:23,604 --> 01:01:25,501
(laughter)

747
01:01:25,501 --> 01:01:27,204
MATT: Go ahead and make a persuasion roll.

748
01:01:27,204 --> 01:01:29,387
TRAVIS: You're going to get six belts thrown at
you.

749
01:01:29,387 --> 01:01:31,118
LIAM: That's terrible. Six.

750
01:01:31,118 --> 01:01:36,530
MATT: It was a brief pause. But also. A brief
pause.

751
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:40,615
LAURA: You have a two in persuasion? Oh wow.

752
01:01:40,615 --> 01:01:44,383
SAM: We'll break in tonight and find it.

753
01:01:44,383 --> 01:01:46,329
TRAVIS: Could we wait outside for Allura?

754
01:01:46,329 --> 01:01:48,161
LIAM: I'll risk it all.

755
01:01:48,161 --> 01:01:56,104
MATT: All right. So you are now currently there in
the cobblestone street of the Cloudtop District,

756
01:01:56,104 --> 01:02:02,052
removed from the Council of Tal'Dorei and left in
this interesting circumstance.

757
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:04,469
SAM: Keyleth, what happened? Your magic didn't
work?

758
01:02:04,469 --> 01:02:06,189
MARISHA: No, it worked.

759
01:02:06,189 --> 01:02:07,490
LAURA: What happened?

760
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:10,395
SAM: But Asum lied.

761
01:02:10,395 --> 01:02:12,328
ORION: He gave her a magic winky face.

762
01:02:12,328 --> 01:02:14,811
MARISHA: Yeah, essentially. Yeah. He gave me like
a--

763
01:02:14,811 --> 01:02:20,697
LAURA: What does that mean? Does that mean Uriel's
under their control? I don't understand.

764
01:02:20,697 --> 01:02:22,978
LIAM: Is he playing some sort of long game here?

765
01:02:22,978 --> 01:02:28,272
SAM: It must mean that we have something to fear
from Uriel. Or someone else close.

766
01:02:28,272 --> 01:02:32,493
MARISHA: I don't know who to trust anymore, to be
totally honest.

767
01:02:32,493 --> 01:02:33,811
TRAVIS: Really?

768
01:02:33,811 --> 01:02:43,636
MARISHA: It worked. I could feel it break. It
worked, and he's got some sort of long game. I

769
01:02:43,636 --> 01:02:49,560
don't know if it's because he doesn't want Uriel
to know, for whatever reason. I don't know if it's

770
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:52,178
because he has some deeper, ulterior motive.

771
01:02:52,178 --> 01:02:55,467
LAURA: Do you think he was faking that he was
healed, and maybe he wasn't?

772
01:02:55,467 --> 01:02:58,599
TRAVIS: Or maybe we have to bring proof of their
vampirism back?

773
01:02:58,599 --> 01:02:59,627
MARISHA: No.

774
01:02:59,627 --> 01:03:00,969
TRAVIS: Oh.

775
01:03:00,969 --> 01:03:07,577
MARISHA: Wait. No to Vex. What was your question?

776
01:03:07,577 --> 01:03:10,812
TRAVIS: To bring back proof of them being
vampires.

777
01:03:10,812 --> 01:03:17,686
SAM: Proof would help. Hey! Don't we have a
prisoner? Can't we question the prisoner?

778
01:03:17,686 --> 01:03:20,738
LAURA: Is he bleeding out? What if he's dead?
We're so screwed!

779
01:03:20,738 --> 01:03:22,673
MARISHA: I made sure.

780
01:03:22,673 --> 01:03:27,119
LAURA: Yeah, the guy that Percy shot the hand off
of.

781
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:29,173
MARISHA: I cauterized his wounds, remember?

782
01:03:29,173 --> 01:03:31,541
SAM: We should question him. He could have proof.

783
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:35,457
LAURA: Oh shit! I hope everything's okay.

784
01:03:35,457 --> 01:03:47,702
ORION: Wait a minute! I really need to go to
Allura. She's our best interest right now.

785
01:03:47,702 --> 01:03:51,521
SAM: We get it! You want her body. Now's not the
time.

786
01:03:51,521 --> 01:03:55,894
ORION: It is beyond that. There are several
reasons to go. We need to get the Earring of

787
01:03:55,894 --> 01:04:05,698
Telescription. I need her to enchant something for
me, too. As well as the fact I fear that our keep

788
01:04:05,698 --> 01:04:10,033
may be in danger. I would like to ask her if she
may be able to set up a warding spell for--

789
01:04:10,033 --> 01:04:16,328
LAURA: Can you go get her and bring her to the
keep? I need to find out if this boy is all

790
01:04:16,328 --> 01:04:17,339
right.

791
01:04:17,339 --> 01:04:20,320
MARISHA: Well, we can split up. I can go with
you.

792
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:27,014
MATT: As you guys are having this discussion, the
palace doors open and you hear the quick footsteps

793
01:04:27,014 --> 01:04:30,975
of Allura, rushing from the palace now, running
towards you guys.

794
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:33,044
LAURA: Saving the day. Again.

795
01:04:33,044 --> 01:04:35,052
MARISHA: Wait, she's coming out of the palace?

796
01:04:35,052 --> 01:04:37,547
MATT: She's coming out of the palace, behind you
guys. Like after the council had just closed. The

797
01:04:37,547 --> 01:04:41,852
meeting had finished. She basically gave chase to
you guys and is now catching up to you on the

798
01:04:41,852 --> 01:04:42,711
street.

799
01:04:42,711 --> 01:04:44,793
SAM: What the shit happened in there?

800
01:04:44,793 --> 01:04:46,929
MARISHA: We were just talking about you!

801
01:04:46,929 --> 01:05:01,525
MATT: "Everyone-- I don't fully know what happened
last night, and--" She looks to you, Tiberius, and

802
01:05:01,525 --> 01:05:07,775
says, "You didn't, did you? Please tell me you did
not kill that woman."

803
01:05:07,775 --> 01:05:09,295
ORION: Oh, I absolutely did!

804
01:05:09,295 --> 01:05:12,356
LAURA: But she was attacking us.

805
01:05:12,356 --> 01:05:15,305
SAM: It looks bad, but she was a threat.

806
01:05:15,305 --> 01:05:23,555
ORION: Her and another one with this-- what was
he, a tiefling? Named the Broker attacked us. And

807
01:05:23,555 --> 01:05:25,088
that's why I killed her.

808
01:05:25,088 --> 01:05:35,019
MATT: "Brom's divination is very clear. And he
divined that the woman was currently filled with

809
01:05:35,019 --> 01:05:40,956
"fear, attempting to flee, and unconscious when she
was murdered."

810
01:05:40,956 --> 01:05:43,652
LIAM: How did she flee when she was unconscious?

811
01:05:43,652 --> 01:05:47,522
TRAVIS: She fled, went unconscious, then we
butchered her.

812
01:05:47,522 --> 01:05:51,495
MARISHA: Just accept it for what it is, guys.

813
01:05:51,495 --> 01:05:59,001
MATT: "I just worry. I know not what happened
here, and I heard what you said, and I honestly do

814
01:05:59,001 --> 01:06:05,271
"not trust the Briarwoods myself either. There was
something about that meal and the conversation,

815
01:06:05,271 --> 01:06:10,280
"and their presence that put me off entirely. It
was strange. And what you say makes a lot of

816
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:20,566
"sense. Vampirism is a bit beyond what I was
expecting. I did sense some powerful masqueraded

817
01:06:20,566 --> 01:06:32,440
"arcane essence from Lady Briarwood. Look, I would
recommend for this to do your best to be thorough

818
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:37,781
"in this. Bring back any and all information you
can. From the words I hear, you probably have at

819
01:06:37,781 --> 01:06:44,173
"best a few weeks before this comes to a close. And
if you don't have enough evidence to support your

01:06:44,173 --> 01:06:48,399
"argument-- well, I don't know."

821
01:06:48,399 --> 01:06:54,979
LIAM: Allura, all I know how to do is break locks,
but I've seen these people do things with magic

822
01:06:54,979 --> 01:07:01,390
that have defied expectations. Why can no one look
into my memory? You have looked across miles.

823
01:07:01,390 --> 01:07:04,751
Cannot anyone look into my mind and see?

824
01:07:04,751 --> 01:07:06,918
LAURA: They're going to do it!

825
01:07:06,918 --> 01:07:10,988
SAM: Yes, but that might not be proof enough for
them. Someone could have corrupted your mind.

826
01:07:10,988 --> 01:07:16,471
MATT: "You have to understand. Not all arcane
works that way. There are magics that can dabble

827
01:07:16,471 --> 01:07:21,148
"in that realm, but none that specialize that here
in Emon. Divination, yes there are elements of

828
01:07:21,148 --> 01:07:29,505
"that. We can see the physical. We can see certain
events. But to look into one's mind is a different

829
01:07:29,505 --> 01:07:30,877
"magic entirely."

830
01:07:30,877 --> 01:07:34,350
LIAM: Are there no spells that can divine if
someone's speaking true?

831
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:41,537
MATT: "That was attempted during that council, but
after you left, Brom notified Uriel and the

832
01:07:41,537 --> 01:07:49,114
"Council that many of you were resistant to the
spell, and as such, it could not be verified."

833
01:07:49,114 --> 01:08:01,236
LAURA: (laughs) We should have rolled low! Just
tell us you're doing it, we won't resist it! What

834
01:08:01,236 --> 01:08:03,459
the shit? Doesn't even trust us to tell the
truth.

835
01:08:03,459 --> 01:08:05,613
TRAVIS: If we came back with proof?

836
01:08:05,613 --> 01:08:08,931
SAM: What sort of proof do you think they would
accept? The head of Lady Briarwood?

837
01:08:08,931 --> 01:08:12,875
LAURA: No, because it'll disappear the minute we
kill her or something. They're vampires, I don't

838
01:08:12,875 --> 01:08:14,349
know what they do.

839
01:08:14,349 --> 01:08:19,923
MATT: She gives a thought to that. She goes,
"Interestingly enough, if an artifact or an item

840
01:08:19,923 --> 01:08:24,714
"brought forth from them could be divined, that
should tell all."

841
01:08:24,714 --> 01:08:28,964
MARISHA: Is there still the remaining wreckage of
their carriage? Is that still there?

842
01:08:28,964 --> 01:08:33,161
MATT: "The carriage has been disposed. It's been
picked over, and there were remnants within the

843
01:08:33,161 --> 01:08:40,766
"rubble of some sort of a 'siggle' of teleportation.
But that is no-- a sigil, if you will."

844
01:08:40,766 --> 01:08:44,406
(laughter)

845
01:08:44,406 --> 01:08:47,900
TRAVIS: What sort of artifact? Like, a brooch? A
handbag?

846
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:50,219
LIAM: Are we talking about that motherfucker's
teeth?

847
01:08:50,219 --> 01:08:51,513
ORION: I need to see that sigil.

848
01:08:51,513 --> 01:09:02,154
MATT: "Sigil. We're all learning together. That, I
believe, has all been investigated and kept under

849
01:09:02,154 --> 01:09:10,914
"lock and key with Asum. You would have to speak
with him. I would like to help. I cannot come with

850
01:09:10,914 --> 01:09:19,288
"you. I'm working on something else at the moment.
Ah!" And she reaches into her pocket and brings

851
01:09:19,288 --> 01:09:24,600
out your Earring of Transcription.

852
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:27,187
ORION: Thank you so much, Lady Allura!

853
01:09:27,187 --> 01:09:34,637
MATT: As she hands it to you, she gives you a
really, really concerned look. And just gives it

854
01:09:34,637 --> 01:09:43,720
to you and hands it back. And it's a look of-- and
it hits you: it's a look of disappointment with a

855
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:45,133
hint of heartbreak.

856
01:09:45,133 --> 01:09:48,715
TRAVIS: Oh, that's the worst! I'm not angry, I'm
just disappointed. Ugh!

857
01:09:48,715 --> 01:09:50,722
LIAM: I feel like I've failed you.

858
01:09:50,722 --> 01:09:51,977
TRAVIS: Yeah.

859
01:09:51,977 --> 01:09:58,174
MATT: She looks back to you as you take it and
goes, "Do your best to clear your name."

860
01:09:58,174 --> 01:09:59,718
ORION: I shall.

861
01:09:59,718 --> 01:10:03,947
MATT: "I know you come of noble blood, and many of
you stand to inspire many others of noble blood.

862
01:10:03,947 --> 01:10:10,291
"As celebrated heroes of this city, there is a lot
more on the line here besides just your

863
01:10:10,291 --> 01:10:20,386
"well-being. There's a lot of people in this town
that look up to you. Nevertheless, I've already

864
01:10:20,386 --> 01:10:23,968
"said more than I should. Good luck."

865
01:10:23,968 --> 01:10:26,572
LAURA: Thank you, Allura.

866
01:10:26,572 --> 01:10:32,700
MATT: She looks behind and you can see she takes
this small hood of the same material of her robe

867
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:37,929
that she's wearing and puts it up over her head
and rushes off towards her white tower towards the

868
01:10:37,929 --> 01:10:39,736
edge of the Cloudtop District.

869
01:10:39,736 --> 01:10:41,517
LIAM: Fucking politics.

870
01:10:41,517 --> 01:10:43,487
SAM: No one insight checked her.

871
01:10:43,487 --> 01:10:49,038
TRAVIS: She's telling the truth. Let's go make
sure the prisoner isn't dead.

872
01:10:49,038 --> 01:10:54,158
SAM: All right. So wait. What are our avenues?
We're going to have to Columbo this. What are our

873
01:10:54,158 --> 01:10:55,811
avenues of finding proof?

874
01:10:55,811 --> 01:10:58,096
LAURA: We say as we're walking back to the keep.

875
01:10:58,096 --> 01:11:03,654
SAM: We have a prisoner we can question. Who knows
if that will yield anything. And then, we might

876
01:11:03,654 --> 01:11:08,745
have to go gather evidence, which means leaving
town against his word.

877
01:11:08,745 --> 01:11:10,090
LAURA: Well, we're allowed to leave town.

878
01:11:10,090 --> 01:11:11,506
LIAM and SAM: No!

879
01:11:11,506 --> 01:11:15,184
LAURA: Yeah! No! He said we're allowed to leave.
We just can't look like we're fleeing, so we tell

880
01:11:15,184 --> 01:11:18,447
them where we're going. They can even fucking
follow us. I don't care.

881
01:11:18,447 --> 01:11:24,716
LIAM: So we tell them that we're going to their
political-- the people that they're trying to

882
01:11:24,716 --> 01:11:30,240
create a political relationship with? We're just
going off to invade your political allies.

883
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:36,018
TRAVIS: Oh come on! You half-elves. I swear to
god! Have you never heard of lying before? Yeah!

884
01:11:36,018 --> 01:11:40,378
We don't tell them where we're going. We're going
on a field trip. We're going to pick berries. Fuck

885
01:11:40,378 --> 01:11:42,166
all, but we go there.

886
01:11:42,166 --> 01:11:44,985
ORION: The only way we can go there is telling
them.

887
01:11:44,985 --> 01:11:47,191
TRAVIS: What? And we're going there, what for?

888
01:11:47,191 --> 01:11:51,833
ORION: When I talk to Asum and get that sigil to
that damn Briarwood keep. That's how we get

889
01:11:51,833 --> 01:11:52,765
there.

890
01:11:52,765 --> 01:11:55,660
TRAVIS: Why don't we say we're taking a picnic--
oh, we took a wrong turn. Hey, it's the

891
01:11:55,660 --> 01:11:56,716
Briarwoods!

892
01:11:56,716 --> 01:12:01,334
ORION: We don't have to lie to them. We tell them
where we're going, and we can just go there.

893
01:12:01,334 --> 01:12:03,283
TRAVIS: We don't have to if we don't want to.

894
01:12:03,283 --> 01:12:04,739
LIAM: You're pretty.

895
01:12:04,739 --> 01:12:07,750
LAURA: Especially that beardy side, Grog.

896
01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:10,254
TRAVIS: It's a full beard right now.

897
01:12:10,254 --> 01:12:18,616
MATT: What you do know is the sigil that a
teleportation circle is attached to is known when

898
01:12:18,616 --> 01:12:25,351
you cast or create the circle. The circle does not
necessarily indicate or maintain the sigil it's

899
01:12:25,351 --> 01:12:26,534
attached to.

900
01:12:26,534 --> 01:12:27,802
ORION: It's just a piece of it?

901
01:12:27,802 --> 01:12:31,974
MATT: Meaning, there are two parts to it. There
is the sigil that it sends to, and there is the

902
01:12:31,974 --> 01:12:39,286
actual ritual circle that is created. The circle
that attaches to it is not the same as the

903
01:12:39,286 --> 01:12:46,205
destination. There are elements of it that connect
it, but you would not be able to ascertain a sigil

904
01:12:46,205 --> 01:12:50,444
to Whitestone immediately from looking at the
initial circle.

905
01:12:50,444 --> 01:12:53,780
LIAM: Thanks for the cups, guys! The cup.

906
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:56,494
TRAVIS: I just noticed that!

907
01:12:56,494 --> 01:13:02,894
LIAM: Well, let's go check on this poor little
shit in the dungeon.

908
01:13:02,894 --> 01:13:06,846
SAM: And then the next step will be to seek out
Seeker Asum?

909
01:13:06,846 --> 01:13:11,243
ORION: I'd like to stop by the temple real quick
to pick up my decanter.

910
01:13:11,243 --> 01:13:13,491
SAM: How many errands do you have to run?

911
01:13:13,491 --> 01:13:15,128
LAURA: Endless errands.

912
01:13:15,128 --> 01:13:20,253
SAM: All right. Go run your errands! We've got a
mystery to solve.

913
01:13:20,253 --> 01:13:23,424
TRAVIS: Yeah, I want to be there when we talk to
the prisoner, too.

914
01:13:23,424 --> 01:13:29,421
MATT: Okay. You guys make your way back to
Greyskull Keep. Are you going with them or

915
01:13:29,421 --> 01:13:30,285
you're--

916
01:13:30,285 --> 01:13:31,860
ORION: I'm doing all the shit.

917
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:33,118
MATT: What are you doing?

918
01:13:33,118 --> 01:13:34,312
SAM: He's got a list.

919
01:13:34,312 --> 01:13:35,921
MATT: I would like to know the list.

920
01:13:35,921 --> 01:13:41,970
ORION: I'm going to stop at an armory because I
want my crossbow reinforced. I don't know what

921
01:13:41,970 --> 01:13:48,567
that means. I want to learn a different sigil. The
one that I researched for the waste fair, or for

922
01:13:48,567 --> 01:13:55,713
the way-- the Feywild! There's this big city next
to it that I researched, that is near it, and in

923
01:13:55,713 --> 01:14:03,743
that city might be a sigil. So I'm going to go see
if I can learn it. And then I want to come back

924
01:14:03,743 --> 01:14:05,872
and start enchanting my blades.

925
01:14:05,872 --> 01:14:07,532
SAM: It's a busy day.

926
01:14:07,532 --> 01:14:08,790
MATT: Okay.

927
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:11,164
ORION: I can give it to you. I wrote it down.

928
01:14:11,164 --> 01:14:18,400
SAM: Coming soon on Friday nights: The Adventures
of Tiberius's Errands! 7:00 to 10:00 every Friday

929
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:19,776
night on Twitch.

930
01:14:19,776 --> 01:14:22,911
ORION: And then I have to go to the dry cleaners
for my robe.

931
01:14:22,911 --> 01:14:29,196
MATT: All right. So as you begin that process, the
rest of you continue back to the Keep. As you

932
01:14:29,196 --> 01:14:36,236
approach Greyskull Keep, there are two individuals
waiting for you at the gate that you do not

933
01:14:36,236 --> 01:14:39,661
recognize from a distance.

934
01:14:39,661 --> 01:14:41,529
SAM: Wait, what? Say that again.

935
01:14:41,529 --> 01:14:44,901
MATT: There's two individuals waiting for you at
the gate. You can see at a distance, but you don't

936
01:14:44,901 --> 01:14:45,946
recognize.

937
01:14:45,946 --> 01:14:47,739
SAM: They're our handlers, probably.

938
01:14:47,739 --> 01:14:49,958
LIAM: Grog, come on. Let's go have a talk with
someone.

939
01:14:49,958 --> 01:14:51,574
LAURA: I walk with you.

940
01:14:51,574 --> 01:14:53,443
SAM: We're all going!

941
01:14:53,443 --> 01:14:55,623
LIAM: Let's go arm in arm in one big line!

942
01:14:55,623 --> 01:14:58,835
LAURA: Well, they're right at our fucking keep.
It's not like we're all headed in the same

943
01:14:58,835 --> 01:15:00,178
direction, anyway.

944
01:15:00,178 --> 01:15:01,930
ORION: Who doesn't have a ring?

945
01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:03,355
SAM: A ring of what?

946
01:15:03,355 --> 01:15:04,501
ORION: An earring.

947
01:15:04,501 --> 01:15:05,929
MARISHA: I have one right now.

948
01:15:05,929 --> 01:15:07,034
SAM: I think I do?

949
01:15:07,034 --> 01:15:08,005
LAURA: I have one.

950
01:15:08,005 --> 01:15:08,955
LIAM: I have one.

951
01:15:08,955 --> 01:15:10,443
LAURA: Grog doesn't have one.

952
01:15:10,443 --> 01:15:12,846
TRAVIS: How far away from the keep are we?

953
01:15:12,846 --> 01:15:17,548
MATT: You're probably a good 100 to 150 feet.

954
01:15:17,548 --> 01:15:24,569
TRAVIS: I whistle really loud and say, who are
these fucks in front of the keep? to the guard

955
01:15:24,569 --> 01:15:26,484
that we have employed.

956
01:15:26,484 --> 01:15:36,782
MATT: Okay. So. Let me try and see who's on duty
right now.

957
01:15:36,782 --> 01:15:42,664
LAURA: He has notes on who is on duty.

958
01:15:42,664 --> 01:15:51,445
MATT: This would still be Shayne and Cordell.
Cordell shouts down from the top of the wall and

959
01:15:51,445 --> 01:15:54,825
says, "I don't think they're a threat."

960
01:15:54,825 --> 01:15:58,584
TRAVIS: Right. We'll be the judge of that. As you
were.

961
01:15:58,584 --> 01:16:01,474
SAM: Grog, keep in mind, these are our allies.

962
01:16:01,474 --> 01:16:03,455
LAURA: Hello!

963
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:09,413
MATT: As you walk up and you get close, you get a
better view. You're expecting ominous, armored

964
01:16:09,413 --> 01:16:14,896
guards. Somebody possibly assigned to escort you.
Instead, you're greeted by what looks to be an

965
01:16:14,896 --> 01:16:20,347
older couple waiting at the gate. A man and a
woman, dressed in simple clothes, weathered skin.

966
01:16:20,347 --> 01:16:23,872
And as you go out to them, they both smile.

967
01:16:23,872 --> 01:16:27,089
SAM: We hate old people.

968
01:16:27,089 --> 01:16:29,040
(laughter)

969
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:30,771
LAURA: Who are you?

970
01:16:30,771 --> 01:16:32,315
TRAVIS: Favored enemy!

971
01:16:32,315 --> 01:16:39,088
MATT: They begin walking up, and the man steps
forward. You can see he's got small dirty glasses

972
01:16:39,088 --> 01:16:45,739
at the end of his nose and says, "Hello, hello!
Good afternoon, everyone! I'm sorry to be a

973
01:16:45,739 --> 01:16:53,126
"bother. But unless my eyes and tales do deceive
me, might you all be the heroes known as Vox

974
01:16:53,126 --> 01:16:54,323
"Machina?"

975
01:16:54,323 --> 01:16:59,219
LAURA: Can I insight check to see if these guys
are legit?

976
01:16:59,219 --> 01:17:00,871
SAM: Legit what? Old people?

977
01:17:00,871 --> 01:17:03,823
LAURA: It could be Lord and Lady Briarwood, for
all I know!

978
01:17:03,823 --> 01:17:10,043
LIAM: Me too. I did well. I rolled 18 on them.

979
01:17:10,043 --> 01:17:19,072
MATT: Okay. From what you can tell, they are both
happy, simple folk that are here with a tension of

980
01:17:19,072 --> 01:17:22,124
purpose, but nothing that seems to set off any
alarms.

981
01:17:22,124 --> 01:17:30,279
SAM: We are Vox Machina. I'm sure word of us has
spread far and wide. We're a pretty big deal. Why

982
01:17:30,279 --> 01:17:32,815
have you made this journey to us?

983
01:17:32,815 --> 01:17:37,996
MATT: The woman, who's holding his side, lets go
of his arm and says, "We come to you humbly as

984
01:17:37,996 --> 01:17:41,904
"representatives of the farming community just
north of Emon's walls."

985
01:17:41,904 --> 01:17:43,704
MARISHA: Oh, I love farmers!

986
01:17:43,704 --> 01:17:48,917
MATT: "I am Riley Klaus and this is my husband,
Ben." "Pleasure to meet y'all."

987
01:17:48,917 --> 01:17:50,254
LAURA: Hi.

988
01:17:50,254 --> 01:17:55,728
MATT: "You see, many of us here, we make our
living through livestock and small crops." Ben

989
01:17:55,728 --> 01:18:02,079
takes over at this point and says, "Word is that
the Sovereign will be calling down troops from

990
01:18:02,079 --> 01:18:09,323
"Fort Daxio for a while, so the need for meats and
fresh produce has been elevated."

991
01:18:09,323 --> 01:18:15,518
The wife, Riley, then says, "Around this time,
over the past two weeks, a number of our finest

992
01:18:15,518 --> 01:18:24,386
"cows and sheep have gone missing. No struggle or
mess or signs of dire wolves. Nothing! We

993
01:18:24,386 --> 01:18:28,669
"suspected thieves, initially, but we sent up our
neighbor's boy Kyle to watch over them until

994
01:18:28,669 --> 01:18:37,903
"sunrise and he saw the culprit. From what he
described, a giant bird, larger than anything he's

995
01:18:37,903 --> 01:18:40,176
"ever seen or heard of."

996
01:18:40,176 --> 01:18:47,276
Ben then takes over the conversation, "Wings at
least ten carts long, tip to tip. Just swooped

997
01:18:47,276 --> 01:18:53,191
"down, he said, without sound and in one motion
snatched up one of our most virile bulls. Mr.

998
01:18:53,191 --> 01:18:55,386
"Simms, just gone like that!"

999
01:18:55,386 --> 01:18:56,868
MARISHA: Mr. Simms?

1000
01:18:56,868 --> 01:18:58,565
MATT: "That was the bull."

1001
01:18:58,565 --> 01:19:02,038
Riley says, "Kyle said he saw it fly northwest."

1002
01:19:02,038 --> 01:19:09,658
MARISHA: Northwest? Can I do a nature check to see
if I can recognize the creature he's describing?

1003
01:19:09,658 --> 01:19:12,477
LIAM: Are we certain he's not describing a
dragon?

1004
01:19:12,477 --> 01:19:13,884
MARISHA: 26.

1005
01:19:13,884 --> 01:19:22,099
MATT: 26. You've seen some big birds in your time.
This is, from what they're describing, a lot

1006
01:19:22,099 --> 01:19:31,733
bigger than any birds you've encountered in your
experience. You've heard whispers of larger birds

1007
01:19:31,733 --> 01:19:46,210
in the wild, but you've never seen anything like
that. You haven't had any personal experience

1008
01:19:46,210 --> 01:19:48,384
hearing or seeing anything of this size.

1009
01:19:48,384 --> 01:19:50,350
MARISHA: But it is a bird?

1010
01:19:50,350 --> 01:19:52,722
MATT: That's what they described it as. At night.

1011
01:19:52,722 --> 01:19:55,034
LAURA: When did these birds start showing up?

1012
01:19:55,034 --> 01:20:02,308
MATT: "About two weeks ago when the whole thing
started to happen."

1013
01:20:02,308 --> 01:20:08,273
And then Ben kicks in and says, "Should this keep
up, most of us will lose everything before the

1014
01:20:08,273 --> 01:20:14,440
"year is out. Now, we've talked with the leaders of
the farming community this side of Emon. We've

1015
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:16,073
"scrounged up what we could."

1016
01:20:16,073 --> 01:20:26,039
And he brings up a couple of coin purses and she
goes, "512 gold pieces, 37 silver, and 103 copper.

1017
01:20:26,039 --> 01:20:27,727
"That's all we can spare."

1018
01:20:27,727 --> 01:20:30,888
LAURA: Keep your money.

1019
01:20:30,888 --> 01:20:32,452
MARISHA: Yes, keep your money.

1020
01:20:32,452 --> 01:20:34,520
MATT: "We can't possibly--"

1021
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:40,560
LIAM: What about this? What if you supplied us
with a small stream of produce for our servants

1022
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:46,453
here at the keep? For cooking, for feeding them,
for feeding us when we're here? It'll be a sight

1023
01:20:46,453 --> 01:20:49,949
less than 500; it wouldn't be nothing. You could
still give us something.

1024
01:20:49,949 --> 01:20:53,308
MATT: "Yes! We could, we'd be more than happy
to!"

1025
01:20:53,308 --> 01:20:59,209
SAM: However, despite what my companion is saying,
we are not agreeing to go after this winged beast

1026
01:20:59,209 --> 01:21:05,959
quite yet. We hear your plight, and we sympathize,
and we will do what we can, but we have very

1027
01:21:05,959 --> 01:21:14,920
pressing matters right now. Is there a deadline of
some sort? When is your next harvesting season?

1028
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:21,328
MATT: "I mean, there's no deadline, but the longer
that goes by, the more and more we lose by the

1029
01:21:21,328 --> 01:21:26,109
"night. Two weeks in and we've lost half of our
livestock. If the creature is this big, I imagine

1030
01:21:26,109 --> 01:21:27,644
"it eats quite a bit."

1031
01:21:27,644 --> 01:21:30,439
LAURA: And how long of a ride is it? Is it walking
distance?

1032
01:21:30,439 --> 01:21:34,426
MATT: "To... where?"

1033
01:21:34,426 --> 01:21:36,286
LAURA, LIAM, and SAM: To your farm.

1034
01:21:36,286 --> 01:21:37,992
MATT: "North side of Emon."

1035
01:21:37,992 --> 01:21:39,493
LAURA: Oh, so real close!

1036
01:21:39,493 --> 01:21:40,427
MATT: "Yes."

1037
01:21:40,427 --> 01:21:48,311
SAM: We are friends of the elderly, obviously, and
also of the farming community, so we are very

1038
01:21:48,311 --> 01:21:54,407
interested in helping you. May we talk about it a
bit before we decide how and when we would tackle

1039
01:21:54,407 --> 01:21:55,732
this problem?

1040
01:21:55,732 --> 01:22:03,883
MATT: They look at each other and nod and he taps
her hand and says, "Yes. By all means-- If you

1041
01:22:03,883 --> 01:22:06,861
"could, please help us stop this beast from ruining
our livelihood."

1042
01:22:06,861 --> 01:22:13,175
MARISHA: And can you please tell us how to get to
your place. Do you normally stay there? Are you

1043
01:22:13,175 --> 01:22:14,413
normally home?

1044
01:22:14,413 --> 01:22:19,867
MATT: "We wander about the community, but we do
have a homestead. If you look, it's the large red

1045
01:22:19,867 --> 01:22:32,339
"wood and partially brick-based homestead closest
to the city walls, on the north farm. Right

1046
01:22:32,339 --> 01:22:36,475
"outside of Emon. It's hard to miss, if you're
headed that direction."

1047
01:22:36,475 --> 01:22:42,179
LIAM: Quickly. Presently, we will find you. Guys,
we were told to sit and spin basically. I mean,

1048
01:22:42,179 --> 01:22:46,523
what's wrong with earning some brownie points in
the eyes of Uriel?

1049
01:22:46,523 --> 01:22:49,181
TRAVIS: Mr. and Mrs. Kraut, as friends of the
elderly--

1050
01:22:49,181 --> 01:22:51,093
MATT: "Klaus."

1051
01:22:51,093 --> 01:22:56,147
TRAVIS: Right, Kraut. Do they normally come at
night, or have they ever abducted any of your

1052
01:22:56,147 --> 01:22:58,147
sweet bulls during the day?

1053
01:22:58,147 --> 01:23:02,873
MATT: "We've not seen it during the day. It'd be
easier for us to identify if we had. Seems to only

1054
01:23:02,873 --> 01:23:04,483
"hunt at night."

1055
01:23:04,483 --> 01:23:07,297
SAM: And have they ever messed with a human?

1056
01:23:07,297 --> 01:23:13,486
MATT: "Not that we've heard of. Not yet." He gives
you this sudden look of realization and fear. And

1057
01:23:13,486 --> 01:23:19,718
pats and comforts his wife who suddenly realizes,
oh my. Are they going to take us now?

1058
01:23:19,718 --> 01:23:24,765
MARISHA: We'll probably be by like tonight or
tomorrow morning.

1059
01:23:24,765 --> 01:23:29,131
LIAM: Yes. Tomorrow morning at the latest. We have
a little bit of business. Yeah.

1060
01:23:29,131 --> 01:23:35,267
MARISHA: So we're in the middle of doing
something. We'll get to it.

1061
01:23:35,267 --> 01:23:38,805
MATT: "All right. Well, thank you."

1062
01:23:38,805 --> 01:23:41,771
LIAM: I take him by the hand and say, we will see
you presently.

1063
01:23:41,771 --> 01:23:45,205
SAM: Here. My business card.

1064
01:23:45,205 --> 01:23:48,824
LIAM: And you can take that to the bank.

1065
01:23:48,824 --> 01:23:51,029
LAURA: You can't actually; it's worth nothing.

1066
01:23:51,029 --> 01:23:57,987
MATT: "Well, thank you for listening to us ramble
on, and we look forward to hearing from you in the

1067
01:23:57,987 --> 01:23:59,216
"next day."

1068
01:23:59,216 --> 01:24:00,454
LAURA: You will.

1069
01:24:00,454 --> 01:24:02,400
MATT: "All right." He pats her on the arm.

1070
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:03,696
TRAVIS: Travel safe, Mr. Kraut!

1071
01:24:03,696 --> 01:24:05,547
LIAM: Hide your bull; hide your wife.

1072
01:24:05,547 --> 01:24:09,097
MATT: They both wander off.

1073
01:24:09,097 --> 01:24:16,732
LAURA: We are in danger of being ostracized. We
should really be nice to everybody right now.

1074
01:24:16,732 --> 01:24:24,610
SAM: We were just having a conversation about how
we should try to be nice from now on. But we do

1075
01:24:24,610 --> 01:24:26,528
have very pressing matters.

1076
01:24:26,528 --> 01:24:29,113
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's get fucking in there and talk
to that little--

1077
01:24:29,113 --> 01:24:32,941
MARISHA: It's funny how that type of thing can
come back to bite you in the ass.

1078
01:24:32,941 --> 01:24:36,112
SAM: I call up to Cordell. Oi, Cordell!

1079
01:24:36,112 --> 01:24:37,455
MATT: "Yeah!"

1080
01:24:37,455 --> 01:24:41,705
SAM: Remember when I told you not to let anyone
linger outside the keep?

1081
01:24:41,705 --> 01:24:47,898
MATT: "To be fair, the Klauses are well-known in
the community."

1082
01:24:47,898 --> 01:24:49,849
TRAVIS: The Krauts?

1083
01:24:49,849 --> 01:24:51,427
LAURA: The Klauses.

1084
01:24:51,427 --> 01:24:58,202
MATT: "They came here for business. I figured it
was probably something you'd want to hear. I

1085
01:24:58,202 --> 01:24:59,101
"apologize."

1086
01:24:59,101 --> 01:25:03,551
SAM: By all means, use your judgment over the
orders of your master. That's fine.

1087
01:25:03,551 --> 01:25:05,146
MARISHA: Scanlan!

1088
01:25:05,146 --> 01:25:09,486
MATT: Cordell bows his head sheepishly. "I
apologize. I'm sorry."

1089
01:25:09,486 --> 01:25:11,132
MARISHA: Ignore him!

1090
01:25:11,132 --> 01:25:14,039
LAURA: We are here to help people! We're here to
help.

1091
01:25:14,039 --> 01:25:18,019
MATT: He does his finger like this and the gates
open in towards the inside of the keep wall.

1092
01:25:18,019 --> 01:25:21,057
MARISHA: And what is wrong with you all today?!

1093
01:25:21,057 --> 01:25:26,221
SAM: We had a really bad dinner last
night. That's all.

1094
01:25:26,221 --> 01:25:28,073
LAURA: I head straight to the jail.

1095
01:25:28,073 --> 01:25:30,333
MARISHA: I follow.

1096
01:25:30,333 --> 01:25:33,209
MATT: As you guys are doing that, Tiberius, what's
the first thing you're trying to do?

1097
01:25:33,209 --> 01:25:35,536
ORION: Stop by and pick up the decanter from the
temple.

1098
01:25:35,536 --> 01:25:41,013
MATT: Okay. He said it required two days. It's
been less than a day since you dropped it off,

1099
01:25:41,013 --> 01:25:42,715
just so you're aware.

1100
01:25:42,715 --> 01:25:49,188
ORION: Then the only thing I do is visit the keep
with the sigils library or whatever.

1101
01:25:49,188 --> 01:25:51,855
MATT: Oh, the Lyceum? Okay.

1102
01:25:51,855 --> 01:25:55,561
LIAM: I'm not going. I'm just going to go hang out
up on the wall outside the keep.

1103
01:25:55,561 --> 01:26:00,027
MATT: All right. As you head to the Lyceum, the
clerk lets you in. What are you specifically

1104
01:26:00,027 --> 01:26:02,839
looking to find or research?

1105
01:26:02,839 --> 01:26:07,687
ORION: The sigil that's closest to the Feywild.

1106
01:26:07,687 --> 01:26:14,558
MATT: Okay. In researching what they have at their
disposal, you understand that the Feywild itself,

1107
01:26:14,558 --> 01:26:21,261
because it is a separate plane, the magics to
traverse it are a little more difficult to do. If

1108
01:26:21,261 --> 01:26:30,140
you notice-- and I'll confirm here just to be sure
that we're on the same page-- before I go full on

1109
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:39,197
this here. Pardon me, just a moment while I scan
through the book. The mighty book. The book of

1110
01:26:39,197 --> 01:26:49,009
might. Yes. Sigils of teleportation require the
same plane of existence, meaning you can teleport

1111
01:26:49,009 --> 01:26:54,559
anywhere within the Prime Material Plane that you
exist in. To traverse into the Feywild, you have

1112
01:26:54,559 --> 01:26:59,339
to actually find a door into the Feywild, and then
you would be able to use a sigil from the

1113
01:26:59,339 --> 01:27:00,683
Feywild.

1114
01:27:00,683 --> 01:27:02,636
ORION: Then I only pick up my decanter.

1115
01:27:02,636 --> 01:27:04,629
MATT: Which is not ready yet.

1116
01:27:04,629 --> 01:27:08,786
ORION: I don't do that! Damn, I forgot! My
short-term memory is just jacked!

1117
01:27:08,786 --> 01:27:10,728
MATT: It's all good. It's all good.

1118
01:27:10,728 --> 01:27:12,950
TRAVIS: You know, somebody's been to the Feywild.

1119
01:27:12,950 --> 01:27:19,450
MATT: Yeah. The Feywild. What you do find is that
the Feywild-- the boundaries between this realm

1120
01:27:19,450 --> 01:27:28,451
and the Feywild tend to grow weaker at full moons.
It's tied to the moon cycle. And at certain

1121
01:27:28,451 --> 01:27:36,551
places where nature is set to run wild. A lot of
druidic tribes tend to mark these locations, and

1122
01:27:36,551 --> 01:27:39,057
in some cases actually guard them.

1123
01:27:39,057 --> 01:27:44,524
LAURA: We know where a hole in one is. Grog went
through it.

1124
01:27:44,524 --> 01:27:52,360
MATT: And if you recall-- good memory-- in the
Frostweald, the partially frozen forest where you

1125
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:59,950
had that conversation with the nymph-- that portal
that she existed through was specifically a door

1126
01:27:59,950 --> 01:28:01,809
into the Feywild, which you recognized.

1127
01:28:01,809 --> 01:28:03,204
ORION: What city was that near?

1128
01:28:03,204 --> 01:28:04,796
MATT: That was south of Westruun.

1129
01:28:04,796 --> 01:28:08,164
ORION: Then I'll go to the thing and I'll find the
Westruun sigil.

1130
01:28:08,164 --> 01:28:16,623
MATT: Okay. Through your research, you do find a
sigil to Westruun. This is allowing you to go into

1131
01:28:16,623 --> 01:28:24,089
this portion for this sigil because you've already
used the favor that you had to get the sigil of

1132
01:28:24,089 --> 01:28:25,304
Kraghammer.

1133
01:28:25,304 --> 01:28:29,609
ORION: No, I didn't. I used the amulet and we got
permission to come there. I saved that favor for

1134
01:28:29,609 --> 01:28:30,552
this.

1135
01:28:30,552 --> 01:28:33,426
MATT: Right, the favor for Gilmore. All I'm saying
is, you've used one of two favors to get that

1136
01:28:33,426 --> 01:28:40,494
sigil. You have to invoke Gilmore's favor to get
this one. Okay. And since you're a part of the

1137
01:28:40,494 --> 01:28:46,249
circumstance, you acquire the secondary sigil. You
now know, in your memory permanently, a sigil to

1138
01:28:46,249 --> 01:28:49,757
Westruun. You don't know where in Westruun, but
you are connected there. If you choose to teleport

1139
01:28:49,757 --> 01:29:02,244
there, you know how to. That favor has now been
used by Gilmore, so you can mark that. And on that

1140
01:29:02,244 --> 01:29:06,871
note, we're going to go ahead and take a five
minute rest break. So yeah, restroom, snacks,

1141
01:29:06,871 --> 01:29:10,926
drinks and we'll be back here in about five or so
minutes. We'll see you guys and continue this

1142
01:29:10,926 --> 01:29:12,757
tense adventure.

1143
01:29:12,757 --> 01:44:42,062
[break]

1144
01:44:42,062 --> 01:44:46,705
MATT: Welcome back. We've had our break; we've
returned to the table. A quick note, we are 50

1145
01:44:46,705 --> 01:44:48,670
subscribers away from our next giveaway.

1146
01:44:48,670 --> 01:44:50,504
TRAVIS: 50? Come on!

1147
01:44:50,504 --> 01:44:54,050
MATT: If we can get there, that'd be awesome!
We'll have our giveaway-- the signed cast Critical

1148
01:44:54,089 --> 01:44:58,074
Role photo and the cast signed art poster by Kit
Buss.

1149
01:44:58,074 --> 01:45:00,438
SAM: Kit Buss, ladies and gentlemen!

1150
01:45:00,438 --> 01:45:10,955
MATT: Yeah! So you have all returned to the keep.
You have found yourselves down to the basement

1151
01:45:10,955 --> 01:45:19,635
area. You hear the distant pinging of metal, an
occasional squeaking metallic noise. Like

1152
01:45:19,635 --> 01:45:25,040
something is being altered, turned, or quenched in
a water trough. Like the process of

1153
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:26,516
blacksmithing.

1154
01:45:26,516 --> 01:45:29,771
MARISHA: I go to the edge of the door and knock.

1155
01:45:29,771 --> 01:45:39,117
MATT: As you knock on the metal door, it's like a
(boom). The pinging stops. Just hangs for a

1156
01:45:39,117 --> 01:45:40,301
second.

1157
01:45:40,301 --> 01:45:43,599
MARISHA: Percy? It's Keyleth.

1158
01:45:43,599 --> 01:45:54,637
MATT: "Not right now. Please. I'm sorry. I just
need to clear my head."

1159
01:45:54,637 --> 01:46:00,501
MARISHA: Okay. We'll be here.

1160
01:46:00,501 --> 01:46:07,743
MATT: A moment later, you see Percy's eyes appear
at the edge of the door.

1161
01:46:07,743 --> 01:46:09,722
MARISHA: Hi!

1162
01:46:09,722 --> 01:46:18,152
MATT: Just looking at them, you can see they look
a little sunken, a little weary.

1163
01:46:18,152 --> 01:46:20,145
MARISHA: Did you sleep?

1164
01:46:20,145 --> 01:46:22,554
MATT: "Not as much as I'd like."

1165
01:46:22,554 --> 01:46:24,619
MARISHA: Do you need anything?

1166
01:46:24,619 --> 01:46:31,062
MATT: His eyes look away for a second, looks back
at you. "I'm all right. Thank you."

1167
01:46:31,062 --> 01:46:38,419
MARISHA: We went and saw Uriel. Everyone in the
city hates us. They think we're all criminals.

1168
01:46:38,419 --> 01:46:42,557
MATT: "Great. I have to get back to my work."

1169
01:46:42,557 --> 01:46:44,256
MARISHA: Okay, yeah.

1170
01:46:44,256 --> 01:46:48,318
MATT: The slit shuts.

1171
01:46:48,318 --> 01:46:51,819
MARISHA: Oh, we'll see you later, then.

1172
01:46:51,819 --> 01:47:01,132
MATT: You guys, however, walk down to the other
side of the cell. The cell door's been closed. The

1173
01:47:01,132 --> 01:47:05,870
keys are hanging on the nail by it. You have not
used the cell until this point. It's technically

1174
01:47:05,870 --> 01:47:10,674
pristine and unused since the construction of the keep,
but the keys still hang on the key ring. On the

1175
01:47:10,674 --> 01:47:15,981
inside of it, there is no thatch. Nothing has been
put in to really make a comfortable floor. And

1176
01:47:15,981 --> 01:47:18,252
hanging from manacles--

1177
01:47:18,252 --> 01:47:19,983
LAURA: He's hanging?!

1178
01:47:19,983 --> 01:47:21,536
SAM: We're the worst.

1179
01:47:21,536 --> 01:47:24,443
MATT: He was put in as a prisoner.

1180
01:47:24,443 --> 01:47:30,307
LAURA: I go and get the keys, and I take him down
from the manacles.

1181
01:47:30,307 --> 01:47:37,478
MATT: As she rushes into the cell, begins
unlocking the manacles. He's unconscious at this

1182
01:47:37,478 --> 01:47:42,261
time. Dirt streaked on his face and spatters of
dried blood from the blast of the gun.

1183
01:47:42,261 --> 01:47:48,971
MARISHA: I go ahead and I administer Cure Wounds.

1184
01:47:48,971 --> 01:47:59,279
MATT: The wound at this point has been cauterized.
You cast Cure Wounds as he starts to come to

1185
01:47:59,279 --> 01:48:08,714
consciousness, in a heap on the ground. (coughs)
It appears he may be healed of any damage he may

1186
01:48:08,714 --> 01:48:13,661
still be sustaining from that, but the fingers are
gone. This is beyond the magic you're capable of.

1187
01:48:13,661 --> 01:48:23,551
He comes to consciousness on the ground, dirtied,
sore. Essentially broken before you.

1188
01:48:23,551 --> 01:48:26,562
LAURA: Does he look like he's been bitten at all?

1189
01:48:26,562 --> 01:48:27,970
MATT: You want to inspect?

1190
01:48:27,970 --> 01:48:29,462
LAURA: Can I look at his neck?

1191
01:48:29,462 --> 01:48:33,591
MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check.

1192
01:48:33,591 --> 01:48:36,397
LAURA: 20.

1193
01:48:36,397 --> 01:48:42,063
MATT: Okay. You don't have a whole lot of
medicinal experience, but you take a moment and

1194
01:48:42,063 --> 01:48:46,759
inspect both sides of his neck, tilting his head
side-to-side, as he's groaning and coming to.

1195
01:48:46,759 --> 01:48:54,568
"What's going on?" Looking at the sides of his
neck, there does not appear to be any sign of any

1196
01:48:54,568 --> 01:49:00,296
puncture wounds, anything that would be reminiscent 
of what your brother currently is healing from.

1197
01:49:00,397 --> 01:49:04,136
MARISHA: Can I do an insight check to see if he is
also under a mind-control spell?

1198
01:49:04,136 --> 01:49:10,174
MATT: At the moment, no. He is barely coming to
consciousness. There isn't enough of a presence at

1199
01:49:10,174 --> 01:49:12,364
the moment to really read past.

1200
01:49:12,364 --> 01:49:18,296
LAURA: Hey, there. Welcome back.

1201
01:49:18,296 --> 01:49:20,896
MATT: "Where am I?"

1202
01:49:20,896 --> 01:49:25,240
LAURA: You are being held, at the moment, for your
own safety.

1203
01:49:25,240 --> 01:49:29,326
MATT: "For my own safety?"

1204
01:49:29,326 --> 01:49:30,828
LAURA: Yeah.

1205
01:49:30,828 --> 01:49:33,800
MATT: "How?" He looks at his hand.

1206
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:40,002
LAURA: Well, you were captured. We're pretty sure
the Briarwoods are going to be pissed as hell that

1207
01:49:40,002 --> 01:49:44,365
you let the carriage get hit. We're just trying to
protect you, really.

1208
01:49:44,365 --> 01:49:48,327
MARISHA: Really?

1209
01:49:48,327 --> 01:49:52,944
SAM: I mean, his friends all died, so.

1210
01:49:52,944 --> 01:50:00,517
MARISHA: Do we not feel like terrible people
enough already?

1211
01:50:00,517 --> 01:50:04,931
SAM: Let's not have this conversation in front of
the prisoner. What's your name, boy!

1212
01:50:04,931 --> 01:50:15,397
MATT: "My name is Desmond. Desmond Otham. I am the
son of a messenger, a courier of the de Rolo

1213
01:50:15,397 --> 01:50:16,376
"family."

1214
01:50:16,376 --> 01:50:19,307
MARISHA: He's the son of a messenger! That's even
more ironic!

1215
01:50:19,307 --> 01:50:21,360
LAURA: Keyleth, do you need to step outside?

1216
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:24,289
MARISHA: No, I'm good. Continue. Son of a
messenger.

1217
01:50:24,289 --> 01:50:30,562
LAURA: Right now, everyone is at risk. The
Briarwoods are bad people, you can attest to this,

1218
01:50:30,562 --> 01:50:31,596
yes?

1219
01:50:31,596 --> 01:50:35,181
MATT: "Yes."

1220
01:50:35,181 --> 01:50:39,421
LAURA: Yes. Can you tell us everything you know
about them?

1221
01:50:39,421 --> 01:50:47,849
MATT: "It's not going to matter. They're going to
find me. No one's supposed to get away."

1222
01:50:47,849 --> 01:50:50,034
LAURA: You did!

1223
01:50:50,034 --> 01:50:55,076
TRAVIS: There's always a first time.

1224
01:50:55,076 --> 01:51:09,653
MATT: "I don't even know where to begin." He
adjusts himself, sliding back, putting his back

1225
01:51:09,653 --> 01:51:12,780
against the wall of the cell.

1226
01:51:12,780 --> 01:51:17,312
TRAVIS: I reach into the Bag of Holding. I pull
out the little goblet, and I pour some ale

1227
01:51:17,312 --> 01:51:27,362
into a cup, and I hand him a little bit of ale. No,
it's fine. I take a little sip.

1228
01:51:27,362 --> 01:51:35,816
MATT: "Please don't take offense if I don't trust
a drink from strangers who've, well, to be honest,

1229
01:51:35,816 --> 01:51:38,473
"put me in this position."

1230
01:51:38,473 --> 01:51:41,128
TRAVIS: All right. I put it beside him.

1231
01:51:41,128 --> 01:51:46,213
MATT: "What do you want to know?"

1232
01:51:46,213 --> 01:51:49,336
LAURA: We want to know if the Briarwoods--

1233
01:51:49,336 --> 01:51:51,432
SAM: Are vampires.

1234
01:51:51,432 --> 01:51:55,157
LAURA: Pretty much. They're vampires, right? I
mean, they're vampires.

1235
01:51:55,157 --> 01:52:07,109
MATT: "All I know from the stories I've heard.
Mothers would tell their kids not to wander out at

1236
01:52:07,109 --> 01:52:16,230
"night because dark things crawl in the shadows.
From what I know of vampires, they're not supposed

1237
01:52:16,230 --> 01:52:22,773
"to go out during the day, right? But I'm sure I've
seen Lady Briarwood walk in the sun many a time."

1238
01:52:22,773 --> 01:52:26,229
MARISHA: Only Lady Briarwood?

1239
01:52:26,229 --> 01:52:39,847
MATT: "As I recall, yes. Lord Briarwood doesn't
make too many public appearances."

1240
01:52:39,847 --> 01:52:49,592
SAM: Have there been any strange goings-on in
their residence? Sounds you've heard? People

1241
01:52:49,592 --> 01:52:53,160
disappearing? Boxes coming in or out?

1242
01:52:53,160 --> 01:53:01,308
LAURA: I cast Cure Wounds on him. I know Cure
Wounds, bitches! Level up!

1243
01:53:01,308 --> 01:53:03,900
ORION: Have I reached the keep yet?

1244
01:53:03,900 --> 01:53:12,258
MATT: No, not yet. You're probably about an hour
away, at this point. From the time you've taken to

1245
01:53:12,258 --> 01:53:18,023
research, find this, learn the sigil to Westruun,
and begin your trek back. Fortunately, you got

1246
01:53:18,023 --> 01:53:24,951
what you wanted, but you're out of the picture for
a little bit. He flinches as you put your hand up,

1247
01:53:24,951 --> 01:53:31,384
and as you touch him, he exhales. You get
to him just as he can react, briefly.

1248
01:53:31,384 --> 01:53:36,902
LAURA: 11. Do I add anything to that?

1249
01:53:37,095 --> 01:53:40,123
MATT: I believe you add your Wisdom modifier to
that.

1250
01:53:40,123 --> 01:53:41,782
LAURA: 14.

1251
01:53:41,782 --> 01:53:57,696
MATT: He goes, "Look, my father worked for the de
Rolo family before the Briarwoods came. My father

1252
01:53:57,696 --> 01:54:05,521
"vanished the night of their fall. My mother was
taken in madness and lost to the night this past

1253
01:54:05,521 --> 01:54:17,905
"year. I was left alone. However, I knew the roads
well between here and Whitestone and places

1254
01:54:17,905 --> 01:54:28,279
"between, growing up, traveling with my father. So
I was made to be a coachman for the new nobles. I

1255
01:54:28,279 --> 01:54:32,469
"was paid, albeit little, and I was left alone.

1256
01:54:32,469 --> 01:54:41,052
"Now, when I say the new nobles, there were nobles
that lived in Whitestone and worked along with the

1257
01:54:41,052 --> 01:54:48,088
"de Rolos, and they helped oversee parts of the
town, the business, and the people. They had been

1258
01:54:48,088 --> 01:54:54,946
"there for many generations of their respective
families, all under the de Rolos' guidance. But

1259
01:54:54,946 --> 01:54:57,998
"the night the castle fell, those nobles were
dragged out.

1260
01:54:57,998 --> 01:55:06,603
"It's strange. I mean, after the brutality of that
first night, it took days before the people of

1261
01:55:06,603 --> 01:55:14,273
"Whitestone knew what had happened. We saw the fires,
we heard the battles, but no word of the victors

1262
01:55:14,273 --> 01:55:21,858
"until three days had passed. We were too scared to
approach. By then, the Briarwoods called a town

1263
01:55:21,858 --> 01:55:34,211
"meeting. They explained their new rule over the
town. A number objected, which is expected. Many

1264
01:55:34,211 --> 01:55:43,185
"strong-willed folk in Whitestone, those days. They
were subsequently shot down at arrow-point. The

1265
01:55:43,185 --> 01:55:45,442
"rest were quiet.

1266
01:55:45,442 --> 01:55:53,506
"They then dragged out the noble families and executed
them, gifting their property and titles to the

1267
01:55:53,506 --> 01:55:59,200
"various cut-throats and mercenaries they had
hired, brought across the channel to help them

1268
01:55:59,200 --> 01:56:05,672
"take the town. They're not just two people;
they've used a lot of money and influence from wherever

1269
01:56:05,672 --> 01:56:15,931
"they came from and brought a whole slew of very
dastardly folk, who have since been given the

1270
01:56:15,931 --> 01:56:21,819
"titles once held by the other nobles of
Whitestone, living in their homes, taking their

1271
01:56:21,819 --> 01:56:28,093
"tithes and most of the profits made from the businesses
they've forced us to continue to run from within

1272
01:56:28,093 --> 01:56:37,625
"the city. A number of families fled into the woods
the night after the executions, using the shadows

1273
01:56:37,625 --> 01:56:48,236
"of a moonless evening to keep safe. They were all
found hanging from the Sun Tree the next morning.

1274
01:56:48,236 --> 01:56:55,639
"They kept things going as they were, mostly:
farming, logging, manning the white marble mines.

1275
01:56:55,639 --> 01:57:04,309
"Business went as usual, all filling the pockets of
the new nobles and the Briarwoods. We were given

1276
01:57:04,309 --> 01:57:11,562
"food, kept our immediate property. As long as we
didn't attempt to leave, we were promised safety.

1277
01:57:11,562 --> 01:57:21,973
"That lasted for a few years, until the nobles
grew bored. Twitchy. They began to abuse the

1278
01:57:21,973 --> 01:57:32,676
"people of Whitestone: scare us for fun, brand,
cut, steal the children, leave them back,

1279
01:57:32,676 --> 01:57:42,640
"destroyed. They treat us like animals. Folks went
missing. I was beaten so bad by my employer, Count

1280
01:57:42,640 --> 01:57:53,331
"Tylieri. But Lord Briarwood noticed, one night he
was passing through the city. He saw wounds on my

1281
01:57:53,331 --> 01:58:00,957
"back when he was meeting with Count Tylieri. When
he asked me in private how I got them, I couldn't

1282
01:58:00,957 --> 01:58:11,260
"lie. Couldn't resist him. He has a way of drawing
the truth out of you. Now, he told me this

1283
01:58:11,260 --> 01:58:17,420
"unrefined violence was boorish to him and his
wife. That was the last I ever saw of Lord

1284
01:58:17,420 --> 01:58:19,690
"Tylieri.

1285
01:58:19,690 --> 01:58:26,340
"Lord and Lady Briarwood took me in as their own
driver and showed me Tylieri hanging from that

1286
01:58:26,340 --> 01:58:35,420
"same Sun Tree the next morning. I was thankful,
then. In a strange way, life had been so terrible

1287
01:58:35,420 --> 01:58:48,114
"for so long, it was the first time I saw someone
reach out and save me. They took me in as their

1288
01:58:48,114 --> 01:58:54,130
"driver after that. It was a better thing to be
away from the anger and the fists of the thugs.

1289
01:58:54,130 --> 01:59:01,730
"But the more I got to know the Briarwoods, the
more nightmarish I realized they were.

1290
01:59:01,730 --> 01:59:10,566
"Behind the walls of that castle was no longer a
grand fortress that we heard it was. Seeing it,

1291
01:59:10,566 --> 01:59:21,621
"keeping watch and guard over our people. No, that
was a domain of perverse magics and sacrilege, it was. The

1292
01:59:21,621 --> 01:59:32,714
"green fog drifting out from the ground where it
stood. The same servants still run the halls, but

1293
01:59:32,714 --> 01:59:44,984
"they aren't living. They're walking vessels of
undeath, their flesh slowly tearing away. The

1294
01:59:44,984 --> 01:59:55,216
"garden in back lies shriveled, a foul green mist
forever pouring out. They're excavating something

1295
01:59:55,216 --> 02:00:01,521
"in the dungeon, plundering pieces. A lot of their
attention seems to be down there; I don't know

1296
02:00:01,521 --> 02:00:16,101
"why. I dare not wander too far down. They bring up
old things. Ancient things. Relics, books, bones.

1297
02:00:16,101 --> 02:00:27,462
"You live in that world long enough, you believe
there is no way out. Death would be easy, though

1298
02:00:27,462 --> 02:00:32,902
"I've seen that death is no real end there. It's
just the beginning of a whole new terrible

1299
02:00:32,902 --> 02:00:38,517
"existence. A far worse fate."

1300
02:00:38,517 --> 02:00:52,304
LAURA: If we keep you here, protected, would you
be willing to tell your story to someone else?

1301
02:00:52,304 --> 02:00:58,553
MATT: "Who would you want me to tell it to?"

1302
02:00:58,553 --> 02:01:07,149
LAURA: The emperor. The guards here. An army that
could go and fight the Briarwoods.

1303
02:01:07,149 --> 02:01:14,781
MATT: "Maybe."

1304
02:01:14,781 --> 02:01:21,635
MARISHA: This could be an option to save
Whitestone, and you would have your freedom.

1305
02:01:21,635 --> 02:01:26,855
MATT: "I don't know. You don't know what it's
like. You don't know what they've done. They're

1306
02:01:26,855 --> 02:01:28,573
"going to find me."

1307
02:01:28,573 --> 02:01:38,346
SAM: We can protect you. We are safe here in this
keep, and you're surrounded by very powerful

1308
02:01:38,346 --> 02:01:40,172
allies now.

1309
02:01:40,172 --> 02:01:43,241
TRAVIS: We've stood before them, and we did not
fall.

1310
02:01:43,241 --> 02:01:45,411
LAURA: It's true.

1311
02:01:45,411 --> 02:01:51,364
MATT: "I'll think about it."

1312
02:01:51,364 --> 02:02:08,944
MARISHA: Would you like to stay in the guest room
upstairs? You'd be more comfortable. You could get

1313
02:02:08,944 --> 02:02:10,242
a good night's rest.

1314
02:02:10,242 --> 02:02:14,084
LAURA: Far more comfortable. A little less safe.
I'm going to put it out there.

1315
02:02:14,084 --> 02:02:20,485
MATT: That resonates with him immediately, and his
eyes flash open. "I mean no disrespect, but if

1316
02:02:20,485 --> 02:02:22,688
"this is safe, then I'd rather stay here."

1317
02:02:22,688 --> 02:02:27,332
LAURA: I think it is. And we will bring a bed down
to you, make sure you're comfortable. I don't want

1318
02:02:27,332 --> 02:02:29,157
you sleeping on the floor. That's terrible.

1319
02:02:29,157 --> 02:02:31,893
MATT: "You're all being very accommodating."

1320
02:02:31,893 --> 02:02:41,107
TRAVIS: You'll get every consideration for
protection. We value your info very much.

1321
02:02:41,107 --> 02:02:46,763
MARISHA: You're also the key to our own freedom,
so it's important.

1322
02:02:46,763 --> 02:02:51,940
SAM: You also caught us on a day where we're
trying to be nicer to people.

1323
02:02:51,940 --> 02:02:56,599
(laughter)

1324
02:02:56,599 --> 02:02:58,747
SAM: Lucky for you.

1325
02:02:58,747 --> 02:03:01,492
LIAM: Just be glad you're not an old woman.

1326
02:03:01,492 --> 02:03:06,531
MATT: "I'll stay here for now."

1327
02:03:06,531 --> 02:03:08,945
LAURA: All right.

1328
02:03:08,945 --> 02:03:16,578
MATT: "I need to think on it. I've been promised
such protection before."

1329
02:03:16,578 --> 02:03:18,454
SAM: From the Briarwoods?

1330
02:03:18,454 --> 02:03:25,554
MATT: "From a few. And they're dead. An enemy of
an enemy doesn't necessarily make them a friend,

1331
02:03:25,554 --> 02:03:27,034
"I've discovered."

1332
02:03:27,034 --> 02:03:37,813
MARISHA: No, but it can make them allies if they
have mutual enemies. Of their enemies. It's a

1333
02:03:37,813 --> 02:03:39,285
little complicated.

1334
02:03:39,285 --> 02:03:43,092
MATT: This whole conversation, the emotional
recalling of everything, you can see has been very

1335
02:03:43,092 --> 02:03:50,422
taxing on him and his still mostly conscious
state. He looks exhausted, scared, and still

1336
02:03:50,422 --> 02:03:53,400
trying to suss out all the information coming at
him right now.

1337
02:03:53,400 --> 02:03:56,250
MARISHA: Grog, why don't you carry the bed down
from upstairs?

1338
02:03:56,250 --> 02:04:02,120
TRAVIS: Not a problem. Keep the goblet nearby. It
is very nice ale.

1339
02:04:02,120 --> 02:04:04,260
MARISHA: Would you like something to eat?

1340
02:04:04,260 --> 02:04:06,557
MATT: "Yes, please."

1341
02:04:06,557 --> 02:04:09,497
MARISHA: We'll have our staff bring down some
food.

1342
02:04:09,497 --> 02:04:14,194
MATT: He takes the goblet. He looks at it, smells
it, but still holds it at bay as you walk off. You

1343
02:04:14,194 --> 02:04:19,124
eventually go-- easy enough for you-- take the
bed. You have to turn it to the side to take it

1344
02:04:19,124 --> 02:04:21,335
out, which causes all of the cushions to fall
out.

1345
02:04:21,335 --> 02:04:22,634
TRAVIS: Aw, shit.

1346
02:04:22,634 --> 02:04:24,418
(laughter)

1347
02:04:24,418 --> 02:04:29,413
TRAVIS: I grab a little pillow with my toes, and I
hobble down.

1348
02:04:29,413 --> 02:04:32,344
MATT: It takes about 20 minutes and three trips,
but you manage to get the bed down there from the

1349
02:04:32,344 --> 02:04:33,380
guest room.

1350
02:04:33,380 --> 02:04:35,311
TRAVIS: Not a problem.

1351
02:04:35,311 --> 02:04:40,109
MATT: When you fit it in the cell-- and it's not a
large cell; it's maybe ten by ten feet maximum.

1352
02:04:40,109 --> 02:04:54,079
You place it there. As you guys walk back, you
notice as you see Grog walking back down the

1353
02:04:54,079 --> 02:04:58,967
stairway-- right around the corner as you go down
the steps, the hallway goes to the cell, and it

1354
02:04:58,967 --> 02:05:03,608
turns to the right and to the left to the
workshop. You see around the corner a shoulder,

1355
02:05:03,653 --> 02:05:10,504
listening in. There's a person. And you recognize
that it is Percy. Percy has stepped out of the

1356
02:05:10,504 --> 02:05:14,634
workshop and apparently has been hearing
everything this entire time.

1357
02:05:14,634 --> 02:05:17,654
LAURA: Are you all right?

1358
02:05:17,654 --> 02:05:22,563
MATT: "I'm fine." And Percy immediately steps away
and you hear the door close with a slam.

1359
02:05:22,563 --> 02:05:24,516
LAURA: Give him time.

1360
02:05:24,516 --> 02:05:26,344
SAM: So moody!

1361
02:05:26,344 --> 02:05:35,115
LAURA: So yeah, I'm going to lock it. I'm just
going to lock your door. To make sure you're safe,

1362
02:05:35,115 --> 02:05:37,728
make sure nobody can get in.

1363
02:05:37,728 --> 02:05:46,168
MATT: "Keep him away from me. Who is that?"

1364
02:05:46,168 --> 02:05:53,286
SAM: He's a friend. I know it doesn't seem like it
from the condition of your paw, but he's a friend.

1365
02:05:53,286 --> 02:05:59,077
He's in the same boat as you, trying to stay safe
from danger.

1366
02:05:59,077 --> 02:06:03,565
LAURA: The Briarwoods destroyed his family, as
well.

1367
02:06:03,565 --> 02:06:12,279
MATT: And you see now, there's like this look of
tension on his face that's mixed with tired. And

1368
02:06:12,279 --> 02:06:16,354
eventually finding the bed and takes the goblet--
still filled, has not drunk from it-- just slips it

1369
02:06:16,354 --> 02:06:19,052
next to the side of the bed. Eventually food is
brought down.

1370
02:06:19,052 --> 02:06:21,595
LAURA: And a chamber pot, because come on!

1371
02:06:21,595 --> 02:06:29,223
MATT: All the basic pleasantries are brought
within the cell. He lies on the bed and takes the

1372
02:06:29,223 --> 02:06:32,815
plate up with him and starts just scarfing some of
the bread rolls down. And immediately starts going

1373
02:06:32,815 --> 02:06:36,706
for the mashed potatoes. You can see a decent meal
hasn't been had in quite a while. Especially the

1374
02:06:36,706 --> 02:06:40,582
journey, what is essentially a seven to eight day
journey from Whitestone, probably has not been

1375
02:06:40,582 --> 02:06:47,757
very kind to him. Eats and then promptly passes
out on the bed. Food still mashed on the side of

1376
02:06:47,757 --> 02:06:50,510
the face. Just goes straight into a slumber.

1377
02:06:50,510 --> 02:06:55,728
TRAVIS: Is there any other entrance to the cell
area besides the door? No barred windows or

1378
02:06:55,728 --> 02:06:57,000
anything like that?

1379
02:06:57,000 --> 02:07:02,445
MATT: No. It's underground. It's all solid, solid
stone walls. And there is the barred front door,

1380
02:07:02,445 --> 02:07:07,292
and then just goes right into the hallway that
goes up the stairs to your left and across the way

1381
02:07:07,292 --> 02:07:08,990
and around the corner to the workshop.

1382
02:07:08,990 --> 02:07:13,267
TRAVIS: You can't cast any kind of alarm system? A
trigger?

1383
02:07:13,267 --> 02:07:15,872
LAURA: So that Percy can't get anything through
there?

1384
02:07:15,872 --> 02:07:23,772
MARISHA: Let me reference my spell tome. It's not
a common one. It's situational. But let me check

1385
02:07:23,772 --> 02:07:28,502
real quick. I haven't read that chapter from my
book in a while.

1386
02:07:28,502 --> 02:07:33,760
ORION: Is Allura on the way back from the
Lyceum?

1387
02:07:33,760 --> 02:07:43,672
MATT: No, the Lyceum is in the Erudite District.
Allura's tower is in the Cloudtop, which is the

1388
02:07:43,672 --> 02:07:45,923
central part of Emon.

1389
02:07:45,923 --> 02:07:51,447
LAURA: I do want to go check out that bird
creature at the farmhouse tonight.

1390
02:07:51,447 --> 02:07:53,884
SAM: Yes. Well, have we stationed a guard down
there?

1391
02:07:53,884 --> 02:07:57,518
TRAVIS: We should. We have five or six.

1392
02:07:57,518 --> 02:08:01,774
SAM: All right. I'll go talk to Cordell. That's
his name, right?

1393
02:08:01,774 --> 02:08:04,048
TRAVIS: No, not Cordell. Let's get somebody else.

1394
02:08:04,048 --> 02:08:07,665
LAURA: Get the crossbow guy that we like so much.
The guy that's the captain of the guards.

1395
02:08:07,665 --> 02:08:12,563
SAM: Is that Kendrick? Or Shayne? Oh, the girl?

1396
02:08:12,563 --> 02:08:16,348
LAURA: No, the guy. He's awesome and he's an
archer, as well.

1397
02:08:16,348 --> 02:08:17,250
SAM: Jarett?

1398
02:08:17,250 --> 02:08:18,697
LAURA: Jarett. That's it!

1399
02:08:18,697 --> 02:08:22,803
SAM: All right, we'll get Jarett. Oh, Jarett?

1400
02:08:22,803 --> 02:08:26,403
MATT: You make your way to the back part of the
wall, and there is a small tower that's

1401
02:08:26,403 --> 02:08:31,930
constructed as part of the back wall. That's where
Jarett usually keeps watch. Jarett has the

1402
02:08:31,930 --> 02:08:36,538
in-between shift between the guards, so he can be
present for both sides and keep a watch during the

1403
02:08:36,538 --> 02:08:43,826
afternoon until the nighttime. Probably till about
midnight or so. So as you make your way out of the

1404
02:08:43,826 --> 02:08:49,844
keep, Tiberius, are you heading back to the keep
or are you heading toward the Cloudtop District?

1405
02:08:49,844 --> 02:08:56,502
This will dictate whether or not you show up
around this time.

1406
02:08:56,502 --> 02:08:59,618
ORION: I'm going to Allura's.

1407
02:08:59,618 --> 02:09:04,120
LAURA: I'm staying down in the prison, just for
the time being. I don't want to leave him alone

1408
02:09:04,120 --> 02:09:05,607
with Percy.

1409
02:09:05,607 --> 02:09:11,862
MATT: You go to find Jarett, who's up at the top
of the tower. And as you call to him, Jarett leans

1410
02:09:11,862 --> 02:09:23,000
over. And you see him, you know, short jet-black
hair, darker complexion. Very handsome, younger,

1411
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:28,368
early-twenties guy. Well-dressed over his studded
leather armor that he wears underneath and has the

1412
02:09:28,368 --> 02:09:33,264
crossbow on the side. He leans over. "Scanlan, it
has been some time. It is so good to hear from

1413
02:09:33,264 --> 02:09:36,404
"you. What can I be of service for?"

1414
02:09:36,404 --> 02:09:41,470
SAM: We need you to watch a prisoner for us,
downstairs in our jail cell, which we had built

1415
02:09:41,470 --> 02:09:49,333
and are now using. You'll be guarding the prisoner
to make sure he doesn't escape, but also making

1416
02:09:49,333 --> 02:09:57,833
sure he stays safe. He possesses information
that's very valuable to us. And one of the people

1417
02:09:57,833 --> 02:10:07,320
who hires you might try to kill him, so if Percy
tries to go in there, can you stop him without

1418
02:10:07,320 --> 02:10:09,677
hurting either party?

1419
02:10:09,677 --> 02:10:18,757
MATT: "I imagine this would be very well-suited
for my skill set. It will be strange to keep watch

1420
02:10:18,757 --> 02:10:25,290
"against one of my employers, but he's been a bit
sheepish around me anyway."

1421
02:10:25,290 --> 02:10:28,562
SAM: You think you could take Percy?

1422
02:10:28,562 --> 02:10:31,384
MATT: "Well, I think I can at least talk some
sense into him!"

1423
02:10:31,384 --> 02:10:32,703
TRAVIS: I like him!

1424
02:10:32,703 --> 02:10:38,948
SAM: Wow! Jarett, you're ballsy! Just out of
curiosity, if he was running at you, what would

1425
02:10:38,948 --> 02:10:39,890
you do?

1426
02:10:39,890 --> 02:10:43,391
(laughter)

1427
02:10:43,391 --> 02:10:48,225
MATT: "Well, first and foremost, I would dive in
the forward motion, leg out, to put him off

1428
02:10:48,225 --> 02:10:53,398
"balance. This would be from a frontal melee--
you're messing with me, aren't you?"

1429
02:10:53,398 --> 02:10:55,067
SAM: A little bit!

1430
02:10:55,067 --> 02:10:59,662
MATT: "Ah, gnomes! Very well."

1431
02:10:59,662 --> 02:11:02,475
SAM: Do you need anything to help?

1432
02:11:02,475 --> 02:11:08,271
MATT: "I have access to my own private armory, and
I have utmost faith."

1433
02:11:08,271 --> 02:11:14,489
SAM: All right. Well, keep him safe and there's an
extra five gold in it for you?

1434
02:11:14,489 --> 02:11:15,965
LAURA: Oh! Pathetic!

1435
02:11:15,965 --> 02:11:18,359
SAM: I don't know! Ten! Ten gold!

1436
02:11:18,359 --> 02:11:19,683
MATT: "Gnomes."

1437
02:11:19,683 --> 02:11:22,802
SAM: I don't know how money works. We'll talk to
Vex about it.

1438
02:11:22,802 --> 02:11:27,619
MATT: "Certainly. All right. I will do this." And
he stands up, and goes and starts gathering his

1439
02:11:27,619 --> 02:11:32,164
general setup supplies inside the guard tower. As
you walk back to the keep, you hear him whistle

1440
02:11:32,164 --> 02:11:37,104
and start calling out to Shayne to go ahead and
take over, up in the tower.

1441
02:11:37,104 --> 02:11:45,974
LIAM: I wasn't there for any of that. I was
upstairs on the roof, just thinking.

1442
02:11:45,974 --> 02:11:56,917
MATT: Tiberius, you make your way into the
Cloudtop District. As you come to the front gates

1443
02:11:56,917 --> 02:12:01,812
of the district, the guards that normally
recognize you and welcome you in, recognize you

1444
02:12:01,812 --> 02:12:04,892
and stand firm, weapons at the ready.

1445
02:12:04,892 --> 02:12:06,971
ORION: At Allura's tower?

1446
02:12:06,971 --> 02:12:10,248
MATT: At the Cloudtop District entirely. You guys
had to get written permission to enter there when

1447
02:12:10,248 --> 02:12:14,251
you first came to Emon, anyway, since that's where
the nobility and many of the important figures of

1448
02:12:14,251 --> 02:12:19,456
Emon reside. It appears that since you've been
taken out of the Council and you're under

1449
02:12:19,456 --> 02:12:25,930
investigation, your access to such a sensitive
location within Emon has been temporarily revoked,

1450
02:12:25,930 --> 02:12:28,749
and the guards are not letting you through.

1451
02:12:28,749 --> 02:12:34,682
ORION: Is that it? So I just turn around? Go
back?

1452
02:12:34,682 --> 02:12:37,838
MATT: It's up to you. The guards are just there,
standing.

1453
02:12:37,838 --> 02:12:49,348
ORION: Greeting and salutations. I'm Tiberius
Stormwind from Draconia. Moreover, a member of Vox

1454
02:12:49,348 --> 02:12:58,394
Machina, over at Greyskull Keep. It seems that you
all are posturing and whatnot. (chuckles) It's

1455
02:12:58,394 --> 02:13:04,442
adorable. But I'm here to see Lady Allura. Could
you let her know that I would like to speak to

1456
02:13:04,442 --> 02:13:09,480
her, or get out of my way so I can just go over
there and tell her myself?

1457
02:13:09,480 --> 02:13:13,432
MATT: "We have direct orders to not let you or any
other member of Vox Machina into the Cloudtop

1458
02:13:13,432 --> 02:13:19,730
"District until your investigation is complete. So
no, and no."

1459
02:13:19,730 --> 02:13:27,230
ORION: Well, do the second thing. If you don't do
one thing, do one of the other things.

1460
02:13:27,230 --> 02:13:34,783
MATT: "Your information and wish has been
processed, taken into consideration. Thank you

1461
02:13:34,783 --> 02:13:36,565
"very much. Please be on your way."

1462
02:13:36,565 --> 02:13:44,578
ORION: Oh, it has been, it has been processed! Oh,
that's good to know! I appreciate that. Very well.

1463
02:13:44,578 --> 02:13:47,487
I cast Fly on myself and I go back to the keep.

1464
02:13:47,487 --> 02:14:04,873
MATT: Okay. (whoosh) They both did not expect that
exit. You essentially Superman-ed. You're just

1465
02:14:04,873 --> 02:14:11,692
like (thud). Little cloud of smoke in the shape of
a dragonborn left behind. All right. So as you

1466
02:14:11,692 --> 02:14:16,471
cruise over, you see in the distance, from where
you're standing at the top of the keep, you see a

1467
02:14:16,471 --> 02:14:23,856
distant bead of dark shadow that approaches and
grows larger, and it is an air-cruising Tiberius

1468
02:14:23,856 --> 02:14:26,929
making his way towards the keep.

1469
02:14:26,929 --> 02:14:32,852
LIAM: I hide behind-- I don't want to get hit, so
I'm going to crouch down a little bit, carefully

1470
02:14:32,852 --> 02:14:38,603
behind one of the pieces of wall. Yeah. Rough
landings, sometimes.

1471
02:14:38,603 --> 02:14:41,833
ORION: I fly in. Vox Machina!

1472
02:14:41,833 --> 02:14:45,191
LIAM: Easy. Be careful.

1473
02:14:45,191 --> 02:14:48,905
ORION: Sorry. Hi. What are you doing? Are you up
here thinking?

1474
02:14:48,905 --> 02:14:57,475
LIAM: Why, I suppose I was. The others are
downstairs interrogating that boy. Where have you

1475
02:14:57,475 --> 02:14:58,913
been?

1476
02:14:58,913 --> 02:15:06,011
ORION: Off doing things that wasn't really that
productive, overall, but they don't like me

1477
02:15:06,011 --> 02:15:09,487
anywhere, especially now.

1478
02:15:09,487 --> 02:15:12,799
LIAM: Do you want to have a drink?

1479
02:15:12,799 --> 02:15:14,664
ORION: Yes, actually, I do.

1480
02:15:14,664 --> 02:15:17,953
LIAM: I've got a flask. You normally drink water.
You want a shot, though?

1481
02:15:17,953 --> 02:15:22,586
ORION: Yes, I would love some alcohol. This calls
for alcohol.

1482
02:15:22,586 --> 02:15:29,451
LIAM: I pull out my flask, and I'm amazed, because
I've never seen this and I hand it over to him.

1483
02:15:29,451 --> 02:15:32,649
ORION: Oh yes. (whoosh)

1484
02:15:32,649 --> 02:15:35,644
SAM: Did you eat the flask?

1485
02:15:35,644 --> 02:15:38,271
ORION: No, fire breath.

1486
02:15:38,271 --> 02:15:42,865
LIAM: Do you want to pass that bad boy back? Is it
hot?

1487
02:15:42,865 --> 02:15:44,592
MATT: It's empty.

1488
02:15:44,592 --> 02:15:49,049
LIAM: Oh, it's empty! Well, I guess that was worth
it.

1489
02:15:49,049 --> 02:15:53,188
ORION: (slurred) What? What are you talking about?
Don't you tell me how to drink. Oh, you!

1490
02:15:53,188 --> 02:16:00,478
TRAVIS: I come out from the castle into the
courtyard, and I go, hey! I feel like chicken

1491
02:16:00,478 --> 02:16:03,276
tonight! Can we go hunt this big bird?

1492
02:16:03,276 --> 02:16:06,705
LIAM: Tiberius-- I just got him drunk!

1493
02:16:06,705 --> 02:16:07,863
TRAVIS: Really?

1494
02:16:07,863 --> 02:16:11,540
ORION: (slurred) He gave me a shot of his flask
water, and it's so good.

1495
02:16:11,540 --> 02:16:14,602
TRAVIS: Are you sure you didn't hit him with the
blunt side of your knife again?

1496
02:16:14,602 --> 02:16:18,558
LIAM: No, no, he took a shot of the old firewater,
and I don't know. We might want to slap him a

1497
02:16:18,558 --> 02:16:19,655
bit--

1498
02:16:19,655 --> 02:16:24,160
ORION: (slurred) Allura doesn't like me anymore
because I killed that bitch who tried to kill us,

1499
02:16:24,160 --> 02:16:26,784
and now she's fucking-- nobody likes us!

1500
02:16:26,784 --> 02:16:28,416
LIAM: Let's find Keyleth.

1501
02:16:28,416 --> 02:16:32,602
TRAVIS: Yeah. Smart. Keyleth!

1502
02:16:32,602 --> 02:16:36,521
MARISHA: What? I was reading. What?

1503
02:16:36,521 --> 02:16:38,622
TRAVIS: Tibs got turnt up. Will you fix it?

1504
02:16:38,622 --> 02:16:39,995
MARISHA: How?

1505
02:16:39,995 --> 02:16:41,659
ORION: Vax gave me--

1506
02:16:41,659 --> 02:16:44,237
MARISHA: What did you do? Why are you touching
me?

1507
02:16:44,237 --> 02:16:47,397
ORION: Oh, I love protecting you, it is-- and
Lockheed is, he loves you, too--

1508
02:16:47,397 --> 02:16:49,131
MARISHA: Don't touch me right now!

1509
02:16:49,131 --> 02:16:52,174
ORION: See, I'm telling you, nobody likes me.

1510
02:16:52,174 --> 02:16:56,636
LIAM: I gave him his first drinky. I'm sorry. Do
you think you could pull him out of it?

1511
02:16:56,636 --> 02:16:58,044
MARISHA: What?

1512
02:16:58,044 --> 02:17:01,961
LIAM: I thought he was going to say no! He didn't
leave me any.

1513
02:17:01,961 --> 02:17:14,584
ORION: It's good. Hi. How are you? I'm Tiberius--
Draconia. You are princess pretty face. He likes

1514
02:17:14,584 --> 02:17:16,583
you, too.

1515
02:17:16,583 --> 02:17:23,180
LIAM: Vax walks away, off the roof. Out of here.
I'm gone!

1516
02:17:23,180 --> 02:17:25,117
TRAVIS: Grog is riveted.

1517
02:17:25,117 --> 02:17:29,479
ORION: Human kissy mouth, with you is-- (vomits)

1518
02:17:29,479 --> 02:17:32,343
(laughter)

1519
02:17:32,343 --> 02:17:36,117
ORION: I'm good.

1520
02:17:36,117 --> 02:17:38,250
MARISHA: If you touch me one more time!

1521
02:17:38,250 --> 02:17:40,617
ORION: Oh! Sorry. Did you need to go somewhere?

1522
02:17:40,617 --> 02:17:47,244
MARISHA: I am doing something else, a request that
was already made previously, before "can we fix

1523
02:17:47,244 --> 02:17:51,814
"drunk Tiberius," so I'm a little busy! Why don't
you go sleep it off, take a nap, and I will deal

1524
02:17:51,814 --> 02:17:53,629
with you in a second.

1525
02:17:53,629 --> 02:17:55,024
ORION: Is it sleepy time?

1526
02:17:55,024 --> 02:17:56,127
MARISHA: For you.

1527
02:17:56,127 --> 02:17:57,721
ORION: Should I cast Fireball?

1528
02:17:57,721 --> 02:18:05,266
MARISHA: Oh my god. And I shove him into the cell
and put him in bed--

1529
02:18:05,266 --> 02:18:08,575
TRAVIS: No, we're not in the prison. We're out in
the courtyard.

1530
02:18:08,575 --> 02:18:12,184
MARISHA: Oh, I thought that you said-- everyone
was like, Keyleth!

1531
02:18:12,184 --> 02:18:16,285
LAURA: I'm still in the prison. Everybody else is
out of the prison.

1532
02:18:16,285 --> 02:18:19,366
MATT: So where do you push him?

1533
02:18:19,366 --> 02:18:22,025
ORION: She pushed me off the roof.

1534
02:18:22,025 --> 02:18:24,627
MARISHA: No! I thought we were downstairs.

1535
02:18:24,627 --> 02:18:28,788
ORION: I fall off the roof. I still have Fly on
myself, don't I?

1536
02:18:28,788 --> 02:18:34,862
MARISHA: You don't fall off the roof. I don't know
what I do with him. I let him pass out.

1537
02:18:34,862 --> 02:18:38,005
ORION: I'm going to get a sandwich.

1538
02:18:38,005 --> 02:18:40,499
MARISHA: I let him go get a sandwich.

1539
02:18:40,499 --> 02:18:43,118
SAM: I encourage sandwich!

1540
02:18:43,118 --> 02:18:47,211
(laughter)

1541
02:18:47,211 --> 02:18:53,746
MATT: That's the quote of the night. Encouraged to
get a sandwich, Tiberius wanders off. What are you

1542
02:18:53,746 --> 02:18:56,196
doing to prepare what you were doing?

1543
02:18:56,196 --> 02:18:58,290
MARISHA: I don't know! I got distracted!

1544
02:18:58,290 --> 02:18:59,563
ORION: I'm not there.

1545
02:18:59,563 --> 02:19:00,692
MARISHA: Okay.

1546
02:19:00,692 --> 02:19:04,326
MATT: Well, as the day progresses, what would you
guys like to do?

1547
02:19:04,326 --> 02:19:12,953
MARISHA: Wait. My idea. Okay. We were wanting
extra fortification? We were wanting extra

1548
02:19:12,953 --> 02:19:21,508
protection. Okay? I can't necessarily cast a big
spell. I could cast Hallucinatory Terrain. We have

1549
02:19:21,508 --> 02:19:25,685
a few options; I'm giving them to you all. I can
cast Hallucinatory Terrain to make this look like

1550
02:19:25,685 --> 02:19:30,552
something else. I don't think-- I don't know. I
don't know if that's a good idea. I don't know. I

1551
02:19:30,552 --> 02:19:38,965
could conjure a few woodland beings for, like, extra
bears. We could have some bears guarding the

1552
02:19:38,965 --> 02:19:47,842
palace. I could also throw up a Wall of Thorns, to
barrier the cell with the wall of thorns. You're

1553
02:19:47,842 --> 02:19:49,488
not here?

1554
02:19:49,488 --> 02:19:53,496
SAM: I think everyone left. I think it's just you
and me up here, and drunk Tiberius.

1555
02:19:53,496 --> 02:19:59,956
MARISHA: I went downstairs, and I'm saying this to
the group so I don't have to repeat myself!

1556
02:19:59,956 --> 02:20:04,371
ORION: Oh, so then I turn around with my sandwich
and am like, we have to just make Allura talk to

1557
02:20:04,371 --> 02:20:06,289
us. She can fix everything.

1558
02:20:06,289 --> 02:20:13,015
TRAVIS: I grab Tiberius's mouth and I cover it.
Please continue.

1559
02:20:13,015 --> 02:20:14,742
SAM: Wall of Thorns could be good.

1560
02:20:14,742 --> 02:20:16,662
LAURA: I like Wall of Thorns.

1561
02:20:16,662 --> 02:20:22,738
MARISHA: The thing with Wall of Thorns is it's not
super big. It's 60 feet.

1562
02:20:22,738 --> 02:20:24,020
SAM: That's pretty big!

1563
02:20:24,020 --> 02:20:25,744
LAURA: Oh. That's not the whole place, though.

1564
02:20:25,744 --> 02:20:29,707
SAM: Oh, 60 feet long. I thought you meant high.

1565
02:20:29,707 --> 02:20:34,468
MARISHA: No, it's 100 feet high. It's really high.
Actually, I don't know how high it is. Don't quote

1566
02:20:34,468 --> 02:20:41,227
me on that. But it's not that long, but we could
fortify the doors more. Have bears. We could do

1567
02:20:41,227 --> 02:20:43,086
multiple things, too.

1568
02:20:43,086 --> 02:20:48,874
LIAM: I think that the Hallucinatory Terrain
wouldn't work. I felt like they could see right

1569
02:20:48,874 --> 02:20:50,224
through me.

1570
02:20:50,224 --> 02:20:51,530
TRAVIS: I think so, too.

1571
02:20:51,530 --> 02:20:52,756
MARISHA: On the Briarwoods?

1572
02:20:52,756 --> 02:20:54,835
LAURA: Yeah, they can see through illusions pretty
darn well.

1573
02:20:54,835 --> 02:20:57,356
SAM: Listen, Percy's here. He can defend for us.

1574
02:20:57,356 --> 02:20:59,265
ORION: No, you need a warding spell.

1575
02:20:59,265 --> 02:21:02,869
SAM: Why don't we just leave someone behind?

1576
02:21:02,869 --> 02:21:05,392
MARISHA: Percy's behind.

1577
02:21:05,392 --> 02:21:11,065
TRAVIS: Percy's here and so are five? Six? How
many employees do we have?

1578
02:21:11,065 --> 02:21:13,329
LAURA: Our very capable guards.

1579
02:21:13,329 --> 02:21:17,800
TRAVIS: Why don't you make some extra bears that
don't hate us?

1580
02:21:17,800 --> 02:21:19,325
MARISHA: Huh?

1581
02:21:19,325 --> 02:21:21,768
TRAVIS: Why don't you make some extra bears that
don't hate us?

1582
02:21:21,768 --> 02:21:23,518
MARISHA: All right, I'll make some extra bears.

1583
02:21:23,518 --> 02:21:25,971
ORION: Put some little hats on them and make them
cute.

1584
02:21:25,971 --> 02:21:30,065
LIAM: Do you think you could fix him? Because he's
a lot of firepower if we're going to go--

1585
02:21:30,065 --> 02:21:34,715
MARISHA: What gets rid of drunkenness? (laughs)

1586
02:21:34,715 --> 02:21:36,056
LAURA: Maybe Restoration?

1587
02:21:36,056 --> 02:21:37,634
MATT: Restoration would probably take care of it.

1588
02:21:37,634 --> 02:21:40,423
MARISHA: I don't want to burn a Restoration spell
on your drunkenness.

1589
02:21:40,423 --> 02:21:42,835
LAURA: Can you cast little Restoration?

1590
02:21:42,835 --> 02:21:46,723
MATT: You could also just give it a couple of
hours. Drink a lot of water.

1591
02:21:46,723 --> 02:21:48,718
TRAVIS: What time is it?

1592
02:21:48,718 --> 02:21:54,346
MATT: At this point, it's probably close to 3:00
in the afternoon.

1593
02:21:54,346 --> 02:22:01,504
TRAVIS: So it's 3:00 in the afternoon. The bird
doesn't even come until night. We could let him

1594
02:22:01,504 --> 02:22:03,706
wear it off.

1595
02:22:03,706 --> 02:22:05,408
MARISHA: What time is it?

1596
02:22:05,408 --> 02:22:08,069
SAM: 3:00. We just established this. We're going
to wait until night and go.

1597
02:22:08,069 --> 02:22:11,746
LAURA: She said she hated you. How did that feel?

1598
02:22:11,746 --> 02:22:18,183
LIAM: Fine. That was fine. That was the heat of
the moment. She was angry. We're a team.

1599
02:22:18,183 --> 02:22:21,566
MATT: All right. What's the plan, guys?

1600
02:22:21,566 --> 02:22:25,469
SAM: The plan is we're going to let him sober up.
We're going to give him some coffee. And then

1601
02:22:25,469 --> 02:22:29,745
we're going to set off for the north farmlands at
dusk.

1602
02:22:29,745 --> 02:22:35,371
ORION: Oh, we should get some corn and other
harvestments at the farms.

1603
02:22:35,371 --> 02:22:38,625
MARISHA: I make an army of bears.

1604
02:22:38,625 --> 02:22:40,683
MATT:  Okay. This concentration will last an
hour.

1605
02:22:40,683 --> 02:22:42,091
LAURA: Oh! That's it.

1606
02:22:42,091 --> 02:22:43,670
MATT: The Conjure Woodland Beings?

1607
02:22:43,670 --> 02:23:02,128
MARISHA: Wait! No! Hang on. What if I conjure a
bear, and then-- let me make sure, while they

1608
02:23:02,128 --> 02:23:04,495
figure their stuff out. See, we're all figuring
stuff out?

1609
02:23:04,495 --> 02:23:09,760
LAURA: What if I leave Trinket in the prison with
Jarett?

1610
02:23:09,760 --> 02:23:12,717
TRAVIS: Yeah! That won't freak him out at all.

1611
02:23:12,717 --> 02:23:17,734
SAM: Well, with Cordell. Jarett's down in the
cell. This is defense against invading vampires.

1612
02:23:17,734 --> 02:23:21,247
MARISHA: Okay! I have a better idea!

1613
02:23:21,308 --> 02:23:22,156
TRAVIS: Yep?

1614
02:23:22,156 --> 02:23:23,684
SAM: Oh my god.

1615
02:23:23,684 --> 02:23:30,277
MARISHA: Why don't I conjure an elemental, and
then I can cast Planar Binding on him and he'll

1616
02:23:30,277 --> 02:23:31,908
hang out for 24 hours.

1617
02:23:31,908 --> 02:23:36,180
SAM: Great! Do it. Make it done. Let's go kill a
bird.

1618
02:23:36,180 --> 02:23:37,871
TRAVIS: Lead with that next time.

1619
02:23:37,871 --> 02:23:40,647
MARISHA: I was figuring it out. It's new.

1620
02:23:40,647 --> 02:23:42,282
SAM: You've got to talk it through.

1621
02:23:42,282 --> 02:23:43,845
MARISHA: Figuring it out.

1622
02:23:43,845 --> 02:23:45,154
TRAVIS: That's awesome!

1623
02:23:45,154 --> 02:23:47,259
MATT: Yep! That'll do.

1624
02:23:47,259 --> 02:23:50,592
TRAVIS: Don't vampires hate fire? Can you do fire?

1625
02:23:50,592 --> 02:23:53,334
LAURA: Yeah, fire! Fire elemental!

1626
02:23:53,334 --> 02:23:54,761
LIAM: Running water.

1627
02:23:54,761 --> 02:23:57,788
LAURA: Ooh, water elemental! (gasps) Tiberius,
remember that you--

1628
02:23:57,788 --> 02:23:58,891
TRAVIS: He's drunk!

1629
02:23:58,891 --> 02:23:59,921
LAURA: I know.

1630
02:23:59,921 --> 02:24:01,151
SAM: Don't talk to him.

1631
02:24:01,151 --> 02:24:03,234
TRAVIS: He won't remember anything.

1632
02:24:03,234 --> 02:24:06,043
ORION: (slurred) I love how you shoot arrows at
things' eyeballs.

1633
02:24:06,043 --> 02:24:13,218
SAM: I use Minor Illusion to create Lockheed, and
I have him scamper away.

1634
02:24:13,218 --> 02:24:18,576
ORION: Oh, that's you. But where are you going? You
go play up there. Tell your brother to be good.

1635
02:24:18,576 --> 02:24:20,721
Anyway, you're so pretty.

1636
02:24:20,721 --> 02:24:28,452
MATT: So are you doing that, Marisha? Keyleth, are
you summoning an elemental?

1637
02:24:28,452 --> 02:24:29,739
MARISHA: Yes.

1638
02:24:29,739 --> 02:24:31,409
MATT: Okay. Which kind?

1639
02:24:31,409 --> 02:24:34,113
MARISHA: Water elemental.

1640
02:24:34,113 --> 02:24:38,534
MATT: Okay. And you cast Planar Binding. Part of
the material component cost is a gem that's worth

1641
02:24:38,534 --> 02:24:40,248
at least 1,000 gold pieces.

1642
02:24:40,248 --> 02:24:42,341
TRAVIS: I have one of those.

1643
02:24:42,341 --> 02:24:45,277
LAURA: You do?

1644
02:24:45,277 --> 02:24:48,027
TRAVIS: Yeah. It's a jewel that's red and
palm-sized.

1645
02:24:48,027 --> 02:24:53,832
LAURA: I have a diamond of awesome. And a regular
diamond, as well.

1646
02:24:53,832 --> 02:25:02,334
LIAM: If I create a trap here, can you bind some
magic to it?

1647
02:25:02,334 --> 02:25:08,863
ORION: You can do anything with magic. You can
make things go. You can make things stop.

1648
02:25:08,863 --> 02:25:11,247
TRAVIS: I cover Tiberius's mouth again.

1649
02:25:11,247 --> 02:25:12,865
LAURA: I give her a diamond.

1650
02:25:12,865 --> 02:25:15,499
MATT: All right. Is this the awesome diamond or
the regular diamond?

1651
02:25:15,499 --> 02:25:18,864
LAURA: This is a regular diamond. The awesome
diamond is special.

1652
02:25:18,864 --> 02:25:20,418
MATT: All right.

1653
02:25:20,418 --> 02:25:23,990
LAURA: No! Don't do that!

1654
02:25:23,990 --> 02:25:26,082
MARISHA: I know! Why do you do that?

1655
02:25:26,082 --> 02:25:29,429
LAURA: Diamonds are really expensive! Any
diamonds!

1656
02:25:29,429 --> 02:25:34,188
MARISHA: I know! And an awesome diamond has got to
be more than 1,000, so this time there's got to be

1657
02:25:34,188 --> 02:25:38,845
at least 1,000. Grog, what kind of jewel do you
have?

1658
02:25:38,845 --> 02:25:41,565
TRAVIS: It's a palm-sized ruby.

1659
02:25:41,565 --> 02:25:43,438
MARISHA: A palm-sized ruby?

1660
02:25:43,438 --> 02:25:45,866
TRAVIS: Yeah, I got a big palm!

1661
02:25:45,866 --> 02:25:47,522
MARISHA: Tiberius.

1662
02:25:47,522 --> 02:25:49,726
SAM: No, just don't.

1663
02:25:49,726 --> 02:26:00,886
MATT: Vex. Your keen eye is able to ascertain that
the palm-sized ruby is worth roughly 1,200 gold

1664
02:26:00,886 --> 02:26:03,818
pieces and would be suitable for this ritual.

1665
02:26:03,818 --> 02:26:08,505
LAURA: I think we should use the ruby. Because I
have an eye for these things.

1666
02:26:08,505 --> 02:26:13,050
TRAVIS: Do we think they're going to come while we
do this? Do we want to waste it? Because that's an

1667
02:26:13,050 --> 02:26:20,365
awesome outside defense. Do we want to waste it
for this? What if they're coming? Does it cost one

1668
02:26:20,365 --> 02:26:21,695
jewel per--

1669
02:26:21,695 --> 02:26:22,752
MATT: Yeah.

1670
02:26:22,752 --> 02:26:26,126
TRAVIS: Maybe we should save that, because that's
awesome!

1671
02:26:26,126 --> 02:26:34,173
LIAM: Is there a possibility, DM, that I could--
if he's sobered up-- if I set a trap, that a spell

1672
02:26:34,173 --> 02:26:38,419
of his could be bound to it, somehow, and go off?
I have no idea.

1673
02:26:38,419 --> 02:26:46,188
MATT: It's hard to say. There are certain spells
that can enable that. That can take certain spells

1674
02:26:46,188 --> 02:26:51,432
that trigger at a certain time. Nothing that's
particularly in your guys' realm of experience or

1675
02:26:51,432 --> 02:26:53,104
understanding though, unfortunately.

1676
02:26:53,104 --> 02:26:55,212
LIAM: All right. So I can look into it for the
future, but not today.

1677
02:26:55,212 --> 02:26:58,963
TRAVIS: Keyleth, I like that. I think we should
keep it in case there is an actual attack coming.

1678
02:26:58,963 --> 02:27:03,000
Because it might just, 24 hours and then we waste
it. Nobody came.

1679
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:08,302
MARISHA: That's true. To be fair, the castle's
being heavily watched by outsiders, as well.

1680
02:27:08,302 --> 02:27:12,350
SAM: Okay! Listen. Let's just go.

1681
02:27:12,350 --> 02:27:17,604
ORION: Grog is big. Scanlan's small. Everything is
great. Hi.

1682
02:27:17,604 --> 02:27:20,497
LIAM: Can we leave Trinket? To watch.

1683
02:27:20,497 --> 02:27:24,169
LAURA: What? He's going to go down in the prison
with Jarett.

1684
02:27:24,169 --> 02:27:31,627
MATT: Okay. You bring Trinket down. Trinket stands
watch right in the center, plops down right up

1685
02:27:31,627 --> 02:27:32,887
against the bars.

1686
02:27:32,887 --> 02:27:35,384
LAURA: I knock on Percy's door and say, Percy?

1687
02:27:35,384 --> 02:27:37,084
MATT: "Yes?"

1688
02:27:37,084 --> 02:27:43,327
LAURA: Trinket's out here. If you need anything,
you just come out and you pet him.

1689
02:27:43,327 --> 02:27:45,964
MATT: "Thank you."

1690
02:27:45,964 --> 02:27:47,571
LAURA: Welcome.

1691
02:27:47,571 --> 02:27:51,885
ORION: I also go up to the door and go, Trinket.
(mumbling) Percy.

1692
02:27:51,885 --> 02:27:54,038
LAURA: Aren't you sober yet?

1693
02:27:54,038 --> 02:27:57,054
ORION: No, it's been like five minutes, hasn't
it?

1694
02:27:57,054 --> 02:28:04,443
MATT: Yeah. Over time, over the next two to three
hours or so, you guys have set up a place to go.

1695
02:28:04,443 --> 02:28:07,671
They have given you some water, and you've managed
to sober up a bit.

1696
02:28:07,671 --> 02:28:11,988
LIAM: I actually picked his pocket and took his
bottle of endless water. Don't you have a bottle

1697
02:28:11,988 --> 02:28:13,326
of water like that?

1698
02:28:13,326 --> 02:28:19,203
MATT: No. That is currently left to be blessed for
holy water.

1699
02:28:19,203 --> 02:28:21,825
LIAM: Oh. Oh, well.

1700
02:28:21,825 --> 02:28:27,624
TRAVIS: And we take the scenic route to let him
walk it off as we head up towards Big Bird's

1701
02:28:27,624 --> 02:28:29,496
house.

1702
02:28:29,496 --> 02:28:30,987
SAM: Great!

1703
02:28:30,987 --> 02:28:38,046
MATT: All right. So. You guys make your way around
the outskirts of Emon under moonlight. It's a

1704
02:28:38,046 --> 02:28:46,792
three-quarter waxing moon. You make your way to
the farm vicinity on the north side of the city.

1705
02:28:46,792 --> 02:28:52,592
It doesn't take long for you to eventually suss
out the house that matches the description that

1706
02:28:52,592 --> 02:28:59,756
you were given by the Klauses. You knock on the
door, and they eagerly greet your arrival and

1707
02:28:59,756 --> 02:29:08,732
invite you in. "So glad you all could make it.
Have you decided? Have you given our community's

1708
02:29:08,732 --> 02:29:11,641
"request some thought?"

1709
02:29:11,641 --> 02:29:14,880
SAM: We're here to help. We're the heroes that you
asked for.

1710
02:29:14,880 --> 02:29:16,393
TRAVIS: We love old people.

1711
02:29:16,393 --> 02:29:24,649
MATT: "Thank you. That's really good of you. We
will happily provide you with fresh produce, going

1712
02:29:24,649 --> 02:29:28,265
"forward. We've talked to a few of the members of
the community and we're going to make sure that's

1713
02:29:28,265 --> 02:29:29,358
"taken care of."

1714
02:29:29,358 --> 02:29:33,315
SAM: Where do you think we should stake out this
bird? Where are your livestock kept?

1715
02:29:33,315 --> 02:29:39,302
MATT: "The livestock are kept on the eastern side
of this community. If you look about, say about

1716
02:29:39,302 --> 02:29:47,432
"half a mile out to where the actual residences
stop being clustered together, you'll see there

1717
02:29:47,432 --> 02:29:54,585
"are a number of large livestock containment areas.
Hard to miss out there. We have pens for sheep; we

1718
02:29:54,585 --> 02:30:01,132
"have pens for cows; we have pens for horses, other
beasts of burden. That whole vicinity is where

1719
02:30:01,132 --> 02:30:05,278
"most of these attacks seem to be coming. So that's
probably your best bet there."

1720
02:30:05,278 --> 02:30:08,045
LIAM: And the biggest you have are the bulls, you
said?

1721
02:30:08,045 --> 02:30:12,211
MATT: "Bulls. We have a few big cows, as well.
We've lost a few of them, unfortunately."

1722
02:30:12,211 --> 02:30:17,284
TRAVIS: That'll be all we need.

1723
02:30:17,284 --> 02:30:21,827
LAURA: Can one of us polymorph into a giant cow?

1724
02:30:21,827 --> 02:30:23,319
SAM: Sure.

1725
02:30:23,319 --> 02:30:27,282
MARISHA: I could also talk to cows again. Maybe
these cows will know something.

1726
02:30:27,282 --> 02:30:30,788
TRAVIS: We head out to the pasture.

1727
02:30:30,788 --> 02:30:36,045
MARISHA: First can I ask her, you said your
neighbor boy, Kyle?

1728
02:30:36,045 --> 02:30:40,307
SAM: Kyle. The neighbor boy. The neighbor boy's
son. Yes.

1729
02:30:40,307 --> 02:30:43,483
MATT: "That's true. Kyle's the one who originally
spotted it, yeah."

1730
02:30:43,483 --> 02:30:45,366
MARISHA: Where does he live?

1731
02:30:45,366 --> 02:30:51,139
MATT: "He's actually the son of the man who runs
most of the livestock areas over there. You can go

1732
02:30:51,139 --> 02:30:54,343
"and head over there. He's probably still up,
keeping his eye out in case it comes back."

1733
02:30:54,343 --> 02:30:56,460
MARISHA: Thank you. I go to Kyle.

1734
02:30:56,460 --> 02:31:03,333
MATT: Okay. You guys make your way over there.
It's easy to find. There's large pens. You can see

1735
02:31:03,333 --> 02:31:09,157
that for as big as the pens are built and their
structure, they are noticeably dwindled. You can

1736
02:31:09,157 --> 02:31:13,960
see why there's been some worry in the community
here. The fact that it's only been two weeks and

1737
02:31:13,960 --> 02:31:22,120
this many creatures are gone is a little
disconcerting. As you get there, you can see the

1738
02:31:22,120 --> 02:31:28,363
house has its light on. There are glowing windows.
And sitting in a chair, holding a crossbow across

1739
02:31:28,363 --> 02:31:40,042
his lap, you see a 19-year-old boy, rugged chin
growth, dirty red hair that's disheveled. And he's

1740
02:31:40,042 --> 02:31:44,570
sitting there looking around in the sky. Rocking
back and forth in his chair as you approach. "Who

1741
02:31:44,570 --> 02:31:45,667
"goes there?"

1742
02:31:45,667 --> 02:31:51,448
SAM: Don't worry, we're friends. We're friends of
the Klauses. Mr. and Mrs. Klaus.

1743
02:31:51,448 --> 02:31:55,497
MATT: "Okay. Okay. So you the ones they say was
coming to help?"

1744
02:31:55,497 --> 02:31:56,848
MARISHA: Yes.

1745
02:31:56,848 --> 02:31:58,201
TRAVIS: Aye.

1746
02:31:58,201 --> 02:31:59,901
LAURA: We hear you have a keen eye, Kyle.

1747
02:31:59,901 --> 02:32:03,091
MATT: "I've seen some things, yeah."

1748
02:32:03,091 --> 02:32:06,294
SAM: Where have they been attacking lately?

1749
02:32:06,294 --> 02:32:11,955
MATT: Points to the whole area in front of him and
says, "Are you keeping watch now? Great. Thank

1750
02:32:11,955 --> 02:32:13,145
"you."

1751
02:32:13,145 --> 02:32:17,363
MARISHA: No! Wait! Don't leave yet. We need you.

1752
02:32:17,363 --> 02:32:23,200
ORION: Yes, yes. Keyleth. We are Vox Machina. Over
from Greyskull Keep. I'm Tiberius Stormwind.

1753
02:32:23,200 --> 02:32:30,045
MARISHA: That's irrelevant. The point is, I was
wondering if you had any more information about

1754
02:32:30,045 --> 02:32:32,523
the creature.

1755
02:32:32,523 --> 02:32:42,533
MATT: "I mean, other than the fact that it was
just a really big bird. Really big. Huge."

1756
02:32:42,533 --> 02:32:46,691
MARISHA: Do you remember any other details? Any
other defining details other than "bird?"

1757
02:32:46,691 --> 02:32:48,825
MATT: "It's hard to see in the moonlight."

1758
02:32:48,825 --> 02:32:53,835
SAM: When it picks up a cow or whatever it's been
picking up, does it strike with the beak or the

1759
02:32:53,835 --> 02:32:55,109
claws? The talons.

1760
02:32:55,109 --> 02:32:59,292
MATT: "Claws, and sometimes it takes two at a
time, one in each claw, and just carries them

1761
02:32:59,292 --> 02:33:00,262
"away. "

1762
02:33:00,262 --> 02:33:02,686
ORION: Have you seen any of its droppings
anywhere?

1763
02:33:02,686 --> 02:33:04,618
MATT: "No. "

1764
02:33:04,618 --> 02:33:08,053
TRAVIS: Have you managed to hit it with your
crossbow?

1765
02:33:08,053 --> 02:33:11,372
MATT: "I've missed."

1766
02:33:11,372 --> 02:33:16,462
LIAM: And you're certain this is a feathered
beast, or no?

1767
02:33:16,462 --> 02:33:22,532
MATT: "Best I can see. It's dark out here at that
time of night and it looks like a bird. It doesn't

1768
02:33:22,532 --> 02:33:29,021
"make any noise and swoops on down and takes them
away and flies off in that direction."

1769
02:33:29,021 --> 02:33:34,109
TRAVIS: I've heard that those giant birds are
attracted to red-headed, 19-year-old, scruffy-chin

1770
02:33:34,109 --> 02:33:36,217
folk with crossbows.

1771
02:33:36,217 --> 02:33:38,543
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

1772
02:33:38,543 --> 02:33:41,569
TRAVIS: Awesome.

1773
02:33:41,569 --> 02:33:43,689
MATT: This would be with your charisma.

1774
02:33:43,689 --> 02:33:44,975
TRAVIS: 22.

1775
02:33:44,975 --> 02:33:56,666
MATT: Nice. He goes, "Well, I don't want to be
here, then. You guys can keep an eye out. I've got

1776
02:33:56,666 --> 02:33:59,790
"to go." And unloads the bolt in the crossbow,
slings it up under his arm--

1777
02:33:59,790 --> 02:34:06,654
SAM: Wait! Before you leave. I'm sorry. I have an
itch. And it can only be scratched with a cowbell.

1778
02:34:06,654 --> 02:34:15,811
Do you have a cowbell anywhere around here? I just
need a cowbell. Can I borrow a cowbell from you?

1779
02:34:15,811 --> 02:34:18,067
MATT: "Your kid's weird." And he keeps walking.

1780
02:34:18,067 --> 02:34:19,728
MARISHA: Your kid is weird!

1781
02:34:19,728 --> 02:34:21,692
SAM: I'm not a child!

1782
02:34:21,692 --> 02:34:24,535
LAURA: Do I see any cowbells on the ground?

1783
02:34:24,535 --> 02:34:33,124
MATT: You can take a glance about. You eventually
can see that there is set up on one of the fences

1784
02:34:33,124 --> 02:34:35,224
that fences in the cows, there is a cowbell, yes.

1785
02:34:35,224 --> 02:34:36,591
LAURA: Hey, there's a cowbell, Scanlan.

1786
02:34:36,637 --> 02:34:44,882
SAM: Great. It will help the ruse. Here's my plan:
we're all cows. Is that an okay plan?

1787
02:34:44,882 --> 02:34:46,078
LAURA: I like it!

1788
02:34:46,078 --> 02:34:50,278
MARISHA: I'm into this plan. But doesn't that
essentially make us the bait?

1789
02:34:50,278 --> 02:34:52,714
SAM: Yes, we're our own bait. Are you cool with
that?

1790
02:34:52,714 --> 02:34:54,888
LAURA: Should one of us maybe not be a cow?

1791
02:34:54,888 --> 02:34:58,154
MARISHA: Well, here's the thing, maybe a few of us
should not be cows because only a few people are

1792
02:34:58,154 --> 02:35:02,775
going to have the ability to turn out of being a
cow once they are a cow, unless they take damage.

1793
02:35:02,775 --> 02:35:06,045
TRAVIS: We went from all cows to pretty much
no one is a cow.

1794
02:35:06,045 --> 02:35:11,633
LAURA: No, Keyleth is definitely a cow. No, I
mean-- I didn't-- we didn't mean like that. You're

1795
02:35:11,633 --> 02:35:13,718
very lovely.

1796
02:35:13,718 --> 02:35:18,062
MARISHA: It's okay. What Vax said was way worse,
earlier.

1797
02:35:18,062 --> 02:35:19,936
TRAVIS: How do you come out of being a cow, if you
are one?

1798
02:35:19,936 --> 02:35:21,408
SAM: I can get rid of it.

1799
02:35:21,408 --> 02:35:27,864
TRAVIS: You would do it? Let's do it! When else
are we all going to be cows? Come on! Unless it

1800
02:35:27,864 --> 02:35:30,793
kills them instantly, we'll be fine.

1801
02:35:30,793 --> 02:35:32,964
ORION: I'm fine. I go invisible.

1802
02:35:32,964 --> 02:35:34,642
MATT: Okay.

1803
02:35:34,642 --> 02:35:42,890
LAURA: I'm going to lay in wait with an arrow. All
the rest of you can be cows.

1804
02:35:42,890 --> 02:35:46,034
LIAM: I think I'm better served waiting to
strike.

1805
02:35:46,034 --> 02:35:49,909
SAM: You and me, Grog. We're cows!

1806
02:35:49,909 --> 02:35:55,448
LIAM: If it grabs one of them, I'll deal more
damage. If it grabs me, I'll deal no damage. But

1807
02:35:55,448 --> 02:35:57,950
if it grabs Scanlan cow, I can--

1808
02:35:57,950 --> 02:36:04,602
MARISHA: Another thing is, I can turn into a cow.
I can turn someone else into a cow. Well,

1809
02:36:04,602 --> 02:36:07,604
Polymorph is a concentration spell.

1810
02:36:07,604 --> 02:36:09,659
SAM: I can turn us all into cows.

1811
02:36:09,659 --> 02:36:11,863
MARISHA: Oh. Because you got that thing.

1812
02:36:11,863 --> 02:36:15,228
TRAVIS: Cow or no, Keyleth? Give us your answer.

1813
02:36:15,228 --> 02:36:16,988
MARISHA: Oh, I'm a cow.

1814
02:36:16,988 --> 02:36:18,415
SAM: Seeming.

1815
02:36:18,415 --> 02:36:22,519
ORION: Oh, we are not actually cows?

1816
02:36:22,519 --> 02:36:25,280
SAM: We'll just seem like cows.

1817
02:36:25,280 --> 02:36:29,024
MARISHA: Except for me who is going to be an
actual cow.

1818
02:36:29,024 --> 02:36:37,191
ORION: If it's Polymorph, I couldn't cast stuff. I
redact my Invisibility and I'll be a cow. I'm also

1819
02:36:37,191 --> 02:36:39,959
going to be a cow. I want to be a brown cow.

1820
02:36:39,959 --> 02:36:42,637
MARISHA: We're all cows! Just embrace it.

1821
02:36:42,637 --> 02:36:45,135
MATT: You can't change a target's body type.

1822
02:36:45,135 --> 02:36:46,955
SAM: What? No.

1823
02:36:46,955 --> 02:36:49,945
MATT: So the same form of your limbs-- you're
right.

1824
02:36:49,945 --> 02:36:58,631
SAM: You can't change size, but we can all be
Grog-sized cows or Scanlan-sized cows.

1825
02:36:58,631 --> 02:37:03,592
MATT: It's going to be an array of very
strangely sized cows.

1826
02:37:03,592 --> 02:37:07,439
MARISHA: Scanlan would be like a calf. Big calf.

1827
02:37:07,439 --> 02:37:10,824
SAM: What do you think?

1828
02:37:10,824 --> 02:37:12,357
MATT and SAM: I'll allow it!

1829
02:37:12,357 --> 02:37:15,332
(cheering and laughter)

1830
02:37:15,332 --> 02:37:17,748
SAM: Gather close to me!

1831
02:37:17,748 --> 02:37:21,046
TRAVIS: We want to get in the pen first, right?

1832
02:37:21,046 --> 02:37:24,842
SAM: Yes, let's go into the pen, and if I may, I'm
going to wear the cow bell.

1833
02:37:24,842 --> 02:37:27,474
TRAVIS: Sure! You've earned it.

1834
02:37:27,474 --> 02:37:29,711
(laughter)

1835
02:37:29,711 --> 02:37:32,230
LAURA: How you going to put it? I'm just going to
put it around your neck right now.

1836
02:37:32,230 --> 02:37:34,204
TRAVIS: Super loose.

1837
02:37:34,204 --> 02:37:39,070
MATT: You guys make your way into the cow pen. The
little bit of moonlight that's coming down from

1838
02:37:39,070 --> 02:37:42,470
the sky illuminates. You see the cows are
clustered underneath this overhang that is used

1839
02:37:42,470 --> 02:37:52,895
for temporary shelter. You hear this distant
(mooing) as you approach and make noise. No one's

1840
02:37:52,895 --> 02:37:56,539
not too upset yet. It's more low muttering.

1841
02:37:56,539 --> 02:37:58,169
TRAVIS: What if that was attraction?

1842
02:37:58,169 --> 02:37:59,250
MATT: Not yet.

1843
02:37:59,250 --> 02:38:04,988
MARISHA: If we use Seeming, we just appear to be
cows, but we can still speak, right?

1844
02:38:04,988 --> 02:38:07,921
MATT: Yeah. Anything sees you as cows--

1845
02:38:07,921 --> 02:38:11,230
MARISHA: Would be like, holy shit, those are
talking cows!

1846
02:38:11,230 --> 02:38:14,449
SAM: It's "cow-moo-flage."

1847
02:38:14,449 --> 02:38:16,964
(groaning)

1848
02:38:16,964 --> 02:38:19,183
SAM: Thank you.

1849
02:38:19,183 --> 02:38:20,668
ORION: That's good.

1850
02:38:20,668 --> 02:38:27,041
MATT: I have to give you experience for that.

1851
02:38:27,041 --> 02:38:30,427
(laughter)

1852
02:38:30,427 --> 02:38:33,916
LIAM: Wait. What's going on? Are we turning into
cows?

1853
02:38:33,916 --> 02:38:37,285
SAM: We just will seem like cows.

1854
02:38:37,285 --> 02:38:39,013
LIAM: I don't understand magic.

1855
02:38:39,013 --> 02:38:40,611
TRAVIS: Just go along. Go along.

1856
02:38:40,611 --> 02:38:43,461
LAURA: That way we can ambush the bird.

1857
02:38:43,461 --> 02:38:46,623
MARISHA: We are going to look like cows. Are we
going to look like cows to each other, too?

1858
02:38:46,623 --> 02:38:48,177
MATT: You'll find out.

1859
02:38:48,177 --> 02:38:49,538
MARISHA: Okay.

1860
02:38:49,538 --> 02:38:56,475
MATT: As you all gather around the small gnome,
currently adorned with the cowbell around his

1861
02:38:56,475 --> 02:38:57,637
neck.

1862
02:38:57,637 --> 02:38:59,634
LIAM: Just like the brothels, eh?

1863
02:38:59,634 --> 02:39:05,574
MATT: You complete the spell and with a sudden
(whoosh) of cold night air, your vision blurs and

1864
02:39:05,574 --> 02:39:10,579
you blink for a second. You look around and Vox
Machina is now, instead, an array of slightly

1865
02:39:10,579 --> 02:39:12,511
smaller than average cows.

1866
02:39:12,511 --> 02:39:15,176
(mooing)

1867
02:39:15,176 --> 02:39:17,631
SAM: (barks) Oh, wait. No.

1868
02:39:17,631 --> 02:39:19,970
MATT: You're, by the way, more of a calf.

1869
02:39:19,970 --> 02:39:25,311
LAURA: You are so cute, Scanlan.

1870
02:39:25,311 --> 02:39:27,144
MARISHA: Okay, shall we go interview some cows?

1871
02:39:27,144 --> 02:39:32,768
LAURA: Let's go talk to some cows. I want to walk
over to the cows with you.

1872
02:39:32,768 --> 02:39:37,805
MATT: You guys step up, awkwardly, towards the
cows, some of which are sleeping, some of which

1873
02:39:37,805 --> 02:39:41,353
are noticing and sitting there just chewing.

1874
02:39:41,353 --> 02:39:43,103
MARISHA: Which one looks like the alpha male?

1875
02:39:43,103 --> 02:39:44,950
LAURA: The one that's got horns.

1876
02:39:44,950 --> 02:39:50,082
MATT: There are no males in this pen, because they
are cows.

1877
02:39:50,082 --> 02:39:58,143
ORION: I try to speak to the cow.

1878
02:39:58,143 --> 02:40:00,804
MATT: Okay. What do you say?

1879
02:40:00,804 --> 02:40:04,471
ORION: Hello, I'm Tiberius Stormwind from
Draconia.

1880
02:40:04,471 --> 02:40:08,551
MATT: You speak Common. You don't know Cow.

1881
02:40:08,551 --> 02:40:15,078
MARISHA: Tiberius, just because you look like a
cow doesn't mean you can talk to the cows. The

1882
02:40:15,078 --> 02:40:19,359
cows don't understand English. No matter if you
look like a cow, they still don't understand

1883
02:40:19,359 --> 02:40:20,532
Common.

1884
02:40:20,532 --> 02:40:22,756
LIAM: Boy, if Uriel could see us now.

1885
02:40:22,756 --> 02:40:24,773
(laughter)

1886
02:40:24,773 --> 02:40:27,099
TRAVIS: We are "cow-nsel" worthy.

1887
02:40:27,099 --> 02:40:30,032
MARISHA: I cast Speak With Animals.

1888
02:40:30,032 --> 02:40:35,636
MATT: This is the best Vox Machina adventure ever!
All right, you cast Speak With Animals.

1889
02:40:35,636 --> 02:40:41,584
MARISHA: Yes. Actually, how many animals can I hit
with Speak with Animals? It is called Animals,

1890
02:40:41,584 --> 02:40:43,428
right? Or is it just Speak with Animal?

1891
02:40:43,428 --> 02:40:47,602
MATT: I think it affects you. I think it gives you
the ability to speak with.

1892
02:40:47,602 --> 02:40:49,136
MARISHA: Oh, just me the ability?

1893
02:40:49,136 --> 02:40:50,516
ORION: You're Dr. Doolittle.

1894
02:40:50,516 --> 02:40:54,263
MARISHA: Oh, yeah. I think you're right. Okay, so
I cast Speak With Animals on myself.

1895
02:40:54,263 --> 02:40:59,824
MATT: All right. Yep! On self for ten minutes.

1896
02:40:59,824 --> 02:41:05,022
ORION: Make sure the cow-- What? She may know a
cow that is over there.

1897
02:41:05,022 --> 02:41:10,035
MARISHA: Okay, so I go up. Is there a cluster of
nice-looking ladies, sitting around?

1898
02:41:10,035 --> 02:41:13,825
MATT: All the cows are clustered in this one
corner, up against each other for body warmth.

1899
02:41:13,825 --> 02:41:16,303
And there are few that are just like (moo).

1900
02:41:16,303 --> 02:41:18,336
MARISHA: Hello, ladies. Good evening.

1901
02:41:18,336 --> 02:41:27,049
MATT: (moo) Which is what you guys hear. You hear
as a response: "What are you doing? We're trying

1902
02:41:27,049 --> 02:41:28,385
"to sleep."

1903
02:41:28,385 --> 02:41:37,418
MARISHA: I do apologize to awaken you. I was just
curious if you could tell me a little bit about

1904
02:41:37,418 --> 02:41:44,665
some of the events that have been transpiring
around here lately? Mainly, the results of your

1905
02:41:44,665 --> 02:41:46,596
kind getting killed?

1906
02:41:46,596 --> 02:41:48,593
MATT: "My kind?"

1907
02:41:48,593 --> 02:41:50,214
ORION: Just ask about the bird!

1908
02:41:50,214 --> 02:41:53,702
MARISHA: Have you seen a giant bird flying around?
Anyone?

1909
02:41:53,702 --> 02:42:01,191
MATT: At which point, all the cows start shuddering and
say, "Yes. Haven't you? It keeps taking us. Why do

1910
02:42:01,238 --> 02:42:03,162
"you think we're hiding under this?"

1911
02:42:03,162 --> 02:42:05,105
MARISHA: Oh, sure.

1912
02:42:05,105 --> 02:42:08,295
MATT: "Be careful. If you stay out there, it'll
see you."

1913
02:42:08,295 --> 02:42:17,401
MARISHA: Right. Where, exactly? Where have they
been-- okay. Damn, cows! It's never--

1914
02:42:17,401 --> 02:42:22,358
SAM: Keyleth, what vital information have you
learned?

1915
02:42:22,358 --> 02:42:30,137
MARISHA: I'll get back to you in one second. Can
you tell me anything about what it looks like?

1916
02:42:30,137 --> 02:42:38,209
MATT: "It's big and has wings. It's fast, and it
keeps taking us."

1917
02:42:38,209 --> 02:42:44,211
ORION: Ask her where the moon is at night--

1918
02:42:44,211 --> 02:42:47,453
MARISHA: Does it seem to come at a certain time of
the night?

1919
02:42:47,453 --> 02:42:49,853
MATT: "The dark time."

1920
02:42:49,853 --> 02:42:55,215
ORION: It's a cow. This is the same as before.

1921
02:42:55,215 --> 02:42:58,277
TRAVIS: Because nothing is happening I am now
trying to eat grass.

1922
02:42:58,277 --> 02:43:03,214
MATT: You bend down, and take clusters with your
hand, and start eating grass.

1923
02:43:03,214 --> 02:43:05,211
ORION: Oh, we are ourselves, still?

1924
02:43:05,211 --> 02:43:08,289
MATT: Yeah, you are not actually physically cows.
You are still yourselves. You just look like

1925
02:43:08,289 --> 02:43:09,104
cows.

1926
02:43:09,104 --> 02:43:11,456
SAM: I, for once, and it's not weird, I just shit
on the floor.

1927
02:43:11,456 --> 02:43:14,218
(laughter)

1928
02:43:14,218 --> 02:43:15,961
SAM: Seems totally normal.

1929
02:43:15,961 --> 02:43:18,458
TRAVIS: We are in it, baby!

1930
02:43:18,458 --> 02:43:23,829
LAURA: I'm just going to notch a bow to my bow,
just to keep a lookout to the sky.

1931
02:43:23,829 --> 02:43:25,220
MATT: Okay.

1932
02:43:25,220 --> 02:43:27,020
ORION: Can I Prestidigitate smells?

1933
02:43:27,020 --> 02:43:28,471
MATT: You could.

1934
02:43:28,471 --> 02:43:31,564
ORION: Sweet. Go ahead.

1935
02:43:31,564 --> 02:43:34,214
(laughter)

1936
02:43:34,214 --> 02:43:37,763
SAM: All right, so we go out into the field.

1937
02:43:37,763 --> 02:43:42,295
MARISHA: They're cows. I forgot that talking to
cows never goes well.

1938
02:43:42,295 --> 02:43:44,275
LAURA: Yeah, remember Dork?

1939
02:43:44,275 --> 02:43:48,047
MARISHA: Didn't seem to know a lot. They're
simple-minded beasts.

1940
02:43:48,047 --> 02:43:49,528
LAURA: Dork the ox.

1941
02:43:49,528 --> 02:43:51,441
MARISHA: Yeah, poor Dork. Dork the ox.

1942
02:43:51,441 --> 02:43:52,914
MATT: Rest in peace, Dork.

1943
02:43:52,914 --> 02:43:55,742
TRAVIS: Pour a little out.

1944
02:43:55,742 --> 02:44:03,410
MATT: You guys make your way. You wait a while, a
good two-hour period, as cows, before eventually

1945
02:44:03,410 --> 02:44:09,728
you, keeping your eye to the sky with your arrow nocked,
see a whisk of shadow across the moonlight.

1946
02:44:09,728 --> 02:44:11,139
LAURA: (whistles)

1947
02:44:11,139 --> 02:44:13,748
TRAVIS: What was that?

1948
02:44:13,748 --> 02:44:16,237
LAURA: I'm letting you guys fucking know there's
a thing in the sky.

1949
02:44:16,237 --> 02:44:17,862
ORION: Is it Jumanji time?

1950
02:44:17,896 --> 02:44:19,280
SAM: Not quite.

1951
02:44:19,280 --> 02:44:27,491
MATT: At this point, you guys look up, and you see
something circle once. It looks like a bird. It's

1952
02:44:27,491 --> 02:44:31,525
just not as big as you were expecting. Looks like
a bigger hawk.

1953
02:44:31,525 --> 02:44:33,255
ORION: I cast Stoneskin on myself.

1954
02:44:33,255 --> 02:44:39,284
MATT: Okay. Bigger and bigger

1955
02:44:39,284 --> 02:44:41,286
LIAM: My cow is going stealth.

1956
02:44:41,286 --> 02:44:43,217
MATT: Roll for cow stealth!

1957
02:44:43,217 --> 02:44:45,806
(laughter)

1958
02:44:45,806 --> 02:44:48,113
LIAM: 23.

1959
02:44:48,113 --> 02:44:51,315
MATT: Okay. You're still a cow.

1960
02:44:51,315 --> 02:45:04,030
MARISHA: I make myself look available. I step away
from the rest of the herd a little bit.

1961
02:45:04,030 --> 02:45:07,131
TRAVIS: I go into a cow rage and start chewing
faster.

1962
02:45:07,131 --> 02:45:10,399
MATT: You would like to chew! All right.

1963
02:45:10,399 --> 02:45:13,339
LAURA: I Hunter's Mark it.

1964
02:45:13,339 --> 02:45:15,255
MATT: Okay. Well, it has to come within range
first.

1965
02:45:15,255 --> 02:45:16,699
LAURA: As soon as it is.

1966
02:45:16,699 --> 02:45:20,258
MATT: As it swoops down, you see this bird just
gets larger and larger and you realize it was

1967
02:45:20,258 --> 02:45:25,045
quite a distance away. And now that it's getting
closer, the tales you've heard are true. This is

1968
02:45:25,045 --> 02:45:28,123
at least a 100-foot wing span, if not more.

1969
02:45:28,123 --> 02:45:30,847
ORION: I'm going to fix my ring on it.

1970
02:45:30,847 --> 02:45:32,744
MARISHA: 100-foot wing span?

1971
02:45:32,744 --> 02:45:37,186
ORION: As it gets close I'm going to brace my ring
as it's coming towards us.

1972
02:45:37,186 --> 02:45:45,223
MATT: Okay. It comes. It dives down with extreme
speed and goes into a dive. It comes into range.

1973
02:45:45,223 --> 02:45:47,703
You cast Hunter's Mark on it. You have your ring
ready. What you doing?

1974
02:45:47,703 --> 02:45:49,046
ORION: Cast Slow on it!

1975
02:45:49,046 --> 02:45:52,607
MATT: Cast Slow? All righty. What is the DC on
that?

1976
02:45:52,607 --> 02:45:54,053
ORION: 17.

1977
02:45:54,053 --> 02:45:55,422
MATT: And what is the save?

1978
02:45:55,422 --> 02:45:59,395
SAM: Is it wisdom or charisma or something?

1979
02:45:59,395 --> 02:46:03,067
ORION: It's concentration! No, wait, it is a
concentration.

1980
02:46:03,067 --> 02:46:13,827
MATT: Yes it is. That's okay. I'm finding it. All
right, it is wisdom. All right. Oh! What was the

1981
02:46:13,827 --> 02:46:14,861
DC?

1982
02:46:14,861 --> 02:46:15,719
ORION: 17.

1983
02:46:15,719 --> 02:46:24,325
MATT: 17. That is an 18. Rolled a natural 18 on
that one. As it swoops down, you release the spell,

1984
02:46:24,325 --> 02:46:37,468
you are immediately attempting to be grasped in
its talons. That is a 23 to hit.

1985
02:46:37,468 --> 02:46:39,334
MARISHA: That hits.

1986
02:46:39,334 --> 02:46:45,576
MATT: All right. So you then take 23 points of
slashing damage to your cow form.

1987
02:46:45,576 --> 02:46:48,503
LAURA: I thought we were just--

1988
02:46:48,503 --> 02:46:53,883
MATT: Oh. Okay. Sorry. You're not in cow form, are
you? You're illusioned. You're staying normal?

1989
02:46:53,883 --> 02:46:55,383
MARISHA: No, I'm normal.

1990
02:46:55,383 --> 02:46:59,568
MATT: You're normal. Right. Okay. I thought you
were saying you were doing an actual cow form, but

1991
02:46:59,568 --> 02:47:06,100
no. All right. You take 23 points of slashing
damage, and you are currently grappled as it takes

1992
02:47:06,100 --> 02:47:09,822
right back up into the air, clutching Keyleth
within its talons.

1993
02:47:09,822 --> 02:47:11,933
LIAM: How fast can the rest of us do anything?
It's gone?

1994
02:47:11,933 --> 02:47:16,746
MATT: Now you guys can react. It is currently 60
feet away from you.

1995
02:47:16,746 --> 02:47:21,084
LAURA: I immediately-- oh god! I shoot it.

1996
02:47:21,084 --> 02:47:24,917
SAM: Do we have to roll for initiative?

1997
02:47:24,917 --> 02:47:26,272
MATT: You do.

1998
02:47:26,272 --> 02:47:29,742
LAURA: But I was notched already.

1999
02:47:29,742 --> 02:47:36,199
MATT: Right. I'll give you advantage on your
initiative. Because you're notched but you used

2000
02:47:36,199 --> 02:47:42,615
your last turn to cast Hunter's Mark on it.
Everyone roll initiative. You have advantage on it

2001
02:47:42,615 --> 02:47:45,515
because you were nocked, and because you were
ready to react, you have advantage on your

2002
02:47:45,515 --> 02:47:56,712
initiative check, but everyone else just roll
normally. All right. So that is 25 to 20?

2003
02:47:56,712 --> 02:47:57,945
LAURA: 21.

2004
02:47:57,945 --> 02:47:59,307
MATT: 21.

2005
02:47:59,307 --> 02:48:00,659
MATT: 20 to 15?

2006
02:48:00,659 --> 02:48:01,835
LIAM: 17.

2007
02:48:01,835 --> 02:48:02,786
TRAVIS: 18.

2008
02:48:02,786 --> 02:48:04,081
MARISHA: 16.

2009
02:48:04,081 --> 02:48:12,365
MATT: Vax. Keyleth. Scanlan? Tiberius? What you
guys got?

2010
02:48:12,365 --> 02:48:13,510
SAM: Six.

2011
02:48:13,510 --> 02:48:15,485
ORION: Five.

2012
02:48:15,485 --> 02:48:19,794
MATT: Okay. All right. So Vex, you're up first.

2013
02:48:19,794 --> 02:48:23,405
LAURA: I'm going to shoot it through the Blazing
Bowstring.

2014
02:48:23,405 --> 02:48:25,825
MATT: Okay. Go for it. Roll for the attack.

2015
02:48:25,825 --> 02:48:30,342
LAURA: 16.

2016
02:48:30,342 --> 02:48:32,362
MATT: 16 hits.

2017
02:48:32,362 --> 02:48:46,429
LAURA: (counts quietly) 26.

2018
02:48:46,429 --> 02:48:49,700
MATT: 26 points of damage. All righty.

2019
02:48:49,700 --> 02:48:52,371
LAURA: And then I'm going to shoot it again.

2020
02:48:52,371 --> 02:48:53,798
MATT: Go for it.

2021
02:48:53,798 --> 02:48:56,141
LAURA: That one definitely hits: 26.

2022
02:48:56,141 --> 02:48:57,868
MATT: Yeah! That hits.

2023
02:48:57,868 --> 02:49:06,206
LAURA: 26 again.

2024
02:49:06,206 --> 02:49:10,784
MATT: Nice! All right, that brings us to Grog.

2025
02:49:10,784 --> 02:49:16,556
TRAVIS: I take the Firebrand Warhammer, activate
it, turn on the fire. And I put the Chain of

2026
02:49:16,556 --> 02:49:20,263
Returning on it and throw it at the winged beast.

2027
02:49:20,263 --> 02:49:27,862
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll with disadvantage
because it's already roughly 40 to 60 feet away

2028
02:49:27,862 --> 02:49:32,399
from you. It's tough to get there. But you can
try.

2029
02:49:32,399 --> 02:49:42,917
TRAVIS: 15. Nope. 16.

2030
02:49:42,917 --> 02:49:50,429
MATT: Okay. Due to its distance and the dark cover
of night, it's harder to hit and you actually

2031
02:49:50,429 --> 02:49:55,100
swing and throw it and the hammer-- The chain goes
taut and it just drops to the ground and it's just

2032
02:49:55,100 --> 02:49:58,616
out of range of the hammer, as it escapes the
range it would have hit it with.

2033
02:49:58,616 --> 02:49:59,857
TRAVIS: Can I pull it back?

2034
02:49:59,857 --> 02:50:02,460
MATT: Yeah, go for it. That's easy enough, it's
not wedged in anything. You don't have to roll

2035
02:50:02,460 --> 02:50:06,208
for it. All right, so that's your turn. Vax.

2036
02:50:06,255 --> 02:50:12,864
LIAM: I'd like to use a bonus action to click
Boots of Haste together, and I think if I do that,

2037
02:50:12,864 --> 02:50:15,277
I have two actions at that point, right?

2038
02:50:15,277 --> 02:50:24,960
MATT: No. Well you do have an additional action
that can be used only to attack.

2039
02:50:24,960 --> 02:50:30,110
LIAM: Just attack. So what I want to do is click
the Boots of Haste together, use the original

2040
02:50:30,110 --> 02:50:36,527
action to run as far as I can towards the bird,
and then use my final action to sneak attack the

2041
02:50:36,527 --> 02:50:41,474
thing since it's got Keyleth in its talons. That's
up to you.

2042
02:50:41,474 --> 02:50:47,520
MATT: Okay. The sneak attack will not kick in
because Keyleth is not threatening the creature.

2043
02:50:47,520 --> 02:50:54,181
But you go for the attacks. You rush up, you dash,
you get underneath it-- for a moment, because of

2044
02:50:54,181 --> 02:50:59,017
the Boots of Haste, you keep speed with this
giant, darting creature. You, underneath, throw

2045
02:50:59,017 --> 02:51:00,692
your daggers upward.

2046
02:51:00,692 --> 02:51:04,460
LIAM: All right. It would just be one-- I mean if
I use the dash to run as far as I can, that would

2047
02:51:04,460 --> 02:51:06,079
leave me with one attack probably?

2048
02:51:06,079 --> 02:51:08,355
MATT: One attack and your bonus without the damage
bonus.

2049
02:51:08,355 --> 02:51:11,698
LIAM: I'm trying to be a Boy Scout here. Wouldn't
the Boots of Haste clicking be the bonus action?

2050
02:51:11,698 --> 02:51:18,865
Yeah. That is 22 to hit.

2051
02:51:18,865 --> 02:51:20,071
MATT: That hits.

2052
02:51:20,071 --> 02:51:22,504
LIAM: All right. And that's not a whole lot.

2053
02:51:22,504 --> 02:51:26,064
MATT: What's the range increment on a dagger?

2054
02:51:26,064 --> 02:51:27,696
LIAM: That's ten. Ten.

2055
02:51:27,696 --> 02:51:28,717
MATT: Ten?

2056
02:51:28,717 --> 02:51:29,773
LIAM: Yeah.

2057
02:51:29,773 --> 02:51:34,327
MATT: Dagger. Roll again for disadvantage because
it's just within your secondary throwing range.

2058
02:51:34,327 --> 02:51:36,997
LIAM: Oh yeah. Then I missed.

2059
02:51:36,997 --> 02:51:50,458
MATT: Okay. It vanishes into the dark night ahead
of you. So yeah. That is gone. You still have your

2060
02:51:50,458 --> 02:51:55,470
Belt of Returning, you just don't have your snake
belt. Yeah, don't worry guys. I saw the look on

2061
02:51:55,470 --> 02:52:03,396
your face and I'm like, no, it's fine. It comes
back. Okay. Keyleth, you're up. You're currently

2062
02:52:03,396 --> 02:52:10,068
grappled and held within the talons of this giant
bird. You see the entire ground below you.

2063
02:52:10,068 --> 02:52:16,857
MARISHA: Judging by the fairly close up appearance
I have of him at this point, can I tell it is

2064
02:52:16,857 --> 02:52:19,488
probably a "beast" nature?

2065
02:52:19,488 --> 02:52:29,830
MATT: At the sheer size, it's hard to tell. You've
never encountered a beast of this size, but you do

2066
02:52:29,830 --> 02:52:33,271
look up and you can see the talons that are
currently holding you in place and piercing the

2067
02:52:33,271 --> 02:52:38,819
sides of your armor are bird-like talons. And you
do see a series of dark feathers coating the

2068
02:52:38,819 --> 02:52:41,550
entire underbelly of this entity.

2069
02:52:41,550 --> 02:52:46,877
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to attempt to cast
Dominate Beast.

2070
02:52:46,877 --> 02:52:49,395
MATT: Okay. All right.

2071
02:52:49,395 --> 02:52:51,927
MARISHA: It has to make a wisdom saving throw.

2072
02:52:51,927 --> 02:52:53,385
MATT: Okay.

2073
02:52:53,385 --> 02:52:59,110
LAURA: Is your Enhance Ability still active? From
before?

2074
02:52:59,110 --> 02:53:07,890
MATT: That's for ability checks. So you finish
casting the spell. Apparently, this entity is not

2075
02:53:07,890 --> 02:53:09,713
affected by the spell.

2076
02:53:09,713 --> 02:53:11,091
LIAM: Fuck-sticks.

2077
02:53:11,091 --> 02:53:12,311
SAM: It's not a beast?

2078
02:53:12,311 --> 02:53:21,639
MATT: It is not a beast. There's a fine line when
certain creatures of nature are altered by some

2079
02:53:21,639 --> 02:53:27,193
sort of magical essence or their nature perhaps is
not natural at the get-go. Either they were

2080
02:53:27,193 --> 02:53:31,131
created or over time they became something beyond
beast. This seems to fall under that category.

2081
02:53:31,131 --> 02:53:35,801
MARISHA: That's my turn, right?

2082
02:53:35,801 --> 02:53:39,854
MATT: That's your turn. That brings us to its
turn.

2083
02:53:39,854 --> 02:53:44,770
MARISHA: Can I try and break the grapple as a
bonus action?

2084
02:53:44,770 --> 02:53:52,963
MATT: That would be your action to try and break
the grapple. For this creature's turn, it does a

2085
02:53:52,963 --> 02:53:57,758
full double dash of its full flight speed and is
about 250 feet away from you and completely out of

2086
02:53:57,758 --> 02:54:05,500
your guys' reach. You see it (whoosh) up into the
sky, disappearing to the north, north-northwest

2087
02:54:05,500 --> 02:54:09,448
area beyond Emon, carrying Keyleth in its claws.

2088
02:54:09,448 --> 02:54:13,322
LIAM: Keyleth, just get out of its fucking hands
and fall. You can change. We'll catch you; we'll

2089
02:54:13,322 --> 02:54:15,415
do something! Just fall.

2090
02:54:15,415 --> 02:54:18,410
MATT: You're close enough where you can still hear
this, as the desperation kicks in and you

2091
02:54:18,410 --> 02:54:22,586
realize-- seeing your whole party not even visible
at this point except a couple of dark dots in the

2092
02:54:22,586 --> 02:54:26,176
low light of the night.

2093
02:54:26,176 --> 02:54:27,628
SAM: Is it our turn yet?

2094
02:54:27,628 --> 02:54:29,068
MATT: It now comes to Scanlan's turn.

2095
02:54:29,068 --> 02:54:31,012
SAM: Okay. I Dimension Door.

2096
02:54:31,012 --> 02:54:32,074
MATT: What's the range on Dimension Door?

2097
02:54:32,074 --> 02:54:33,394
SAM: 500 feet.

2098
02:54:33,394 --> 02:54:36,467
MATT: You-- and appear where? Where do you want to
appear?

2099
02:54:36,467 --> 02:54:38,836
SAM: On it. On its back.

2100
02:54:38,836 --> 02:54:48,813
MATT: Okay. You appear right on its back. You
immediately land and start sliding back as the

2101
02:54:48,813 --> 02:54:53,132
wind is pushing on you. The feathers themselves,
due to the aerodynamic nature of its flight path;

2102
02:54:53,132 --> 02:54:54,781
it's a lot of wind resistance against you.

2103
02:54:54,781 --> 02:54:56,474
LIAM: Oh, make an acrobatics check.

2104
02:54:56,474 --> 02:54:59,262
ORION: Shush! What the hell?!

2105
02:54:59,262 --> 02:55:03,387
MATT: No, I was going there. Don't worry. That's
what it is. You need to go ahead and make an

2106
02:55:03,482 --> 02:55:06,443
acrobatics check to see if you can maintain
balance on the back of this beast.

2107
02:55:06,443 --> 02:55:09,716
LIAM: My intelligence is not six!

2108
02:55:09,716 --> 02:55:12,220
SAM: 20!

2109
02:55:12,220 --> 02:55:17,553
MATT: You manage to just, you tumble backward a
little bit. You grab a couple of feathers and get

2110
02:55:17,553 --> 02:55:21,809
yourself just on the side underneath where the
wing meets part of the upper torso, where the wind

2111
02:55:21,809 --> 02:55:25,869
resistance is the least amount, and you manage to
hold on. You are now clutching the back of this

2112
02:55:25,869 --> 02:55:29,521
giant bird. That's your turn.

2113
02:55:29,521 --> 02:55:35,850
SAM: Okay. As my bonus action, I will inspire
Keyleth. Right? She's right next to me?

2114
02:55:35,850 --> 02:55:38,994
MARISHA: Scanlan? What the shit?

2115
02:55:38,994 --> 02:55:47,641
SAM: (singing) The way you kick so much ass like
nobody else. The way you do animal things gets me

2116
02:55:47,641 --> 02:55:57,093
overwhelmed. You don't know. You don't know you're
powerful. Oh. That's what makes you powerful.

2117
02:55:57,093 --> 02:56:01,986
MATT: Due to the wind, you don't hear the last
line. It's too loud around it. However, you can

2118
02:56:01,986 --> 02:56:03,647
take a d10 inspiration dice.

2119
02:56:03,647 --> 02:56:05,203
LAURA and MARISHA: Yay!

2120
02:56:05,203 --> 02:56:08,631
LIAM: What a heroic move! Amazing!

2121
02:56:08,631 --> 02:56:14,064
MATT: Which for the record, this currently right
now looks like-- you see the cow clutched below,

2122
02:56:14,064 --> 02:56:18,969
and currently there is a cow holding onto this
giant bird.

2123
02:56:18,969 --> 02:56:20,544
SAM: It lasts eight hours.

2124
02:56:20,544 --> 02:56:24,846
MATT: This singing tiny cow. You artists out
there, have fun with this scene.

2125
02:56:24,846 --> 02:56:28,438
(laughter)

2126
02:56:28,438 --> 02:56:31,109
MATT: All right. That ends your turn. Tiberius.

2127
02:56:31,109 --> 02:56:41,496
ORION: Good. I drop Stoneskin. At 5th-level, I go
myself, one, two, three-- I cast Fly on all of us.

2128
02:56:41,496 --> 02:56:45,346
Fly, you fools! And go right after them.

2129
02:56:45,346 --> 02:56:49,433
MATT: All right. All of you guys, at that point
you see Tiberius and you all take off after him.

2130
02:56:49,433 --> 02:56:53,845
LIAM: The cows take off into the night sky.

2131
02:56:53,845 --> 02:56:58,274
ORION: (shouting) Fly, Vox Machina! Moo!

2132
02:56:58,274 --> 02:57:02,048
MARISHA: Vox "Moo-china!"

2133
02:57:02,048 --> 02:57:04,128
(booing)

2134
02:57:04,128 --> 02:57:10,760
MATT: A squadron of weirdly-sized, flying cows lit
by moonlight, chasing after a giant bird. I love

2135
02:57:10,760 --> 02:57:12,248
Dungeons and Dragons.

2136
02:57:12,248 --> 02:57:16,104
(laughter)

2137
02:57:16,104 --> 02:57:17,693
TRAVIS: What is this?

2138
02:57:17,693 --> 02:57:19,626
MATT: What's the flying speed on Fly?

2139
02:57:19,626 --> 02:57:20,904
ORION: 60 feet.

2140
02:57:20,904 --> 02:57:22,073
MATT: 60 feet. Cool.

2141
02:57:22,073 --> 02:57:24,105
ORION: I'm going to dash. On that.

2142
02:57:24,105 --> 02:57:30,954
MATT: Yep. You guys can go 120 feet every turn. It
can go 240. Two rounds pass before you guys

2143
02:57:30,954 --> 02:57:33,968
realize there is no way you're going to catch up
with this thing or get even close to it.

2144
02:57:33,968 --> 02:57:35,561
LIAM: I've got Haste!

2145
02:57:35,561 --> 02:57:38,163
LAURA: I've got Hunter's Mark on it, so I can
track it.

2146
02:57:38,163 --> 02:57:40,223
LIAM: Double me, yo! I got Haste.

2147
02:57:40,223 --> 02:57:43,674
MATT: Your Haste speed-- your physical body
doesn't affect the Fly spell, unfortunately.

2148
02:57:43,674 --> 02:57:51,191
You're only at the speed that the arcane nature of
the spell can take you. I'm just saying. Your

2149
02:57:51,191 --> 02:57:54,475
metabolism's real fast. Your heartbeat's
hummingbirding it. But you're still only going 120

2150
02:57:54,475 --> 02:58:02,737
feet. So as you guys follow behind, you can see
now, after a while on the edge of the shoreline,

2151
02:58:02,737 --> 02:58:11,526
not too far from Emon-- maybe what would normally
be from horseback or a brisk walk, a half day's

2152
02:58:11,526 --> 02:58:23,045
travel-- you eventually come upon the-- There it
is! You come upon the coastal mountains known as

2153
02:58:23,045 --> 02:58:28,459
the Shoreline Summit. It's a series of unusually
steep mountain bluffs that hug the coastline,

2154
02:58:28,459 --> 02:58:36,422
northwest of Emon. As you get closer, and at this
point you've lost sight of the bird. Scanlan, I

2155
02:58:36,422 --> 02:58:39,817
want you to go ahead and roll an athletics check.

2156
02:58:39,817 --> 02:58:50,654
SAM: Athletics? Well, that doesn't count.
That's not good. Athletics? 16.

2157
02:58:50,654 --> 02:58:58,408
MATT: 16? Okay. You still manage to keep hold for
the portion of the length of the journey. As it

2158
02:58:58,408 --> 02:59:02,513
moves and shifts and the wind itself is still
blowing in your face, though minimized by your

2159
02:59:02,513 --> 02:59:08,793
current positioning. It's a trial to hold onto
this large creature as it makes its wings beat and

2160
02:59:08,793 --> 02:59:14,253
just the sheer force of its movement. All right.
So as you get closer to these mountaintops--

2161
02:59:14,253 --> 02:59:16,029
MARISHA: Do I have a turn yet?

2162
02:59:16,029 --> 02:59:17,896
MATT: You can go ahead and take your turn now too,
yes.

2163
02:59:17,896 --> 02:59:26,572
MARISHA: Yeah? I cast Polymorph on it. You're on
it.

2164
02:59:26,572 --> 02:59:28,101
SAM: Don't worry about me!

2165
02:59:28,101 --> 02:59:30,516
MARISHA: Really?

2166
02:59:30,516 --> 02:59:37,814
SAM: I'm fine! You never need to worry about me.
Haven't you guys learned that by now? I'm fine!

2167
02:59:37,814 --> 02:59:42,138
MARISHA: Out of thematic reasons, I also turn him
into a cow.

2168
02:59:42,138 --> 02:59:46,760
(laughter)

2169
02:59:46,760 --> 02:59:49,354
SAM: That's amazing!

2170
02:59:49,354 --> 02:59:52,044
LIAM: Is what she cries out heroically.

2171
02:59:52,044 --> 02:59:55,944
MATT: Okay. What's the DC on this?

2172
02:59:55,944 --> 03:00:02,240
MARISHA: My spell DC? 18.

2173
03:00:02,240 --> 03:00:03,369
MATT: Rolled a one.

2174
03:00:03,369 --> 03:00:07,138
(laughter)

2175
03:00:07,138 --> 03:00:09,418
SAM: I'm a cow on a cow with a cow!

2176
03:00:09,418 --> 03:00:22,186
MATT: So this giant flying bird-- Moo! And just
begins to plummet at an extremely fast speed. You

2177
03:00:22,186 --> 03:00:28,945
both immediately are released from its grasp.
Scanlan and Keyleth both are just falling. You

2178
03:00:28,945 --> 03:00:33,064
guys don't see this. It's too far away from you
now. At this point, you're probably close to about

2179
03:00:33,064 --> 03:00:36,459
500 feet in the air.

2180
03:00:36,459 --> 03:00:39,957
LIAM: Yo, I heard you liked cows, so I gave you
some cows with your cow.

2181
03:00:39,957 --> 03:00:46,566
MATT: I hope this inspires the next Diablo Cow
level, guys. You really need to look into this.

2182
03:00:46,566 --> 03:00:54,195
All right. So you guys are now both plummeting and
falling at a really, really rapid speed.

2183
03:00:54,195 --> 03:00:56,315
MARISHA: I go eagle form.

2184
03:00:56,315 --> 03:01:00,984
MATT: Flailing cows. You go eagle form. You're
fine. So you go into eagle form. That's your

2185
03:01:00,984 --> 03:01:03,443
action this turn. That's your bonus action,
because you can do that as a--

2186
03:01:03,443 --> 03:01:04,869
MARISHA: As a bonus action!

2187
03:01:04,869 --> 03:01:15,840
MATT: Eagle form. Scanlan, you plummet full speed
on this one. You probably have another two rounds

2188
03:01:15,840 --> 03:01:18,223
before you impact with something very painful.

2189
03:01:18,223 --> 03:01:21,980
LIAM: But he's as heavy as a dust mote, so he just
goes like this all the way down. Right?

2190
03:01:21,980 --> 03:01:23,943
MARISHA: I don't think that's how it works.

2191
03:01:23,943 --> 03:01:25,746
ORION: No, he's a little pebble.

2192
03:01:25,746 --> 03:01:28,935
MARISHA: I can catch him, if you need catched.

2193
03:01:28,935 --> 03:01:32,074
MATT: You guys still continue to give chase.
Eventually, you see this giant thing just go and

2194
03:01:32,074 --> 03:01:35,724
vanish from sight. It's just gone. It just
disappeared.

2195
03:01:35,724 --> 03:01:37,409
ORION: I go full Gandalf.

2196
03:01:37,409 --> 03:01:39,086
MATT: All right.

2197
03:01:39,086 --> 03:01:40,676
LIAM: Never go full Gandalf.

2198
03:01:40,676 --> 03:01:46,727
MATT: You guys are pushing forward. So it's now
the next round for you guys to react. What are you

2199
03:01:46,727 --> 03:01:48,087
doing?

2200
03:01:48,087 --> 03:01:50,054
SAM: I will become a pterodactyl.

2201
03:01:50,054 --> 03:01:51,336
MATT: So you're casting?

2202
03:01:51,336 --> 03:01:52,786
SAM: Polymorph on myself?

2203
03:01:52,786 --> 03:01:59,648
MATT: Okay. Because you are falling and this is a
lot of wind, I'm going to have to ask you to make

2204
03:01:59,648 --> 03:02:02,090
a concentration check to complete the spell.

2205
03:02:02,090 --> 03:02:03,847
LAURA: Come on, Scanlan!

2206
03:02:03,847 --> 03:02:05,391
MATT: So go ahead and roll a d20.

2207
03:02:05,391 --> 03:02:09,401
SAM: This is a concentration not on holding a
spell, but on casting it?

2208
03:02:09,401 --> 03:02:13,375
MATT: Correct. Because as part of the
components of it and maintaining your attention to

2209
03:02:13,375 --> 03:02:14,579
the spell--

2210
03:02:14,579 --> 03:02:17,006
MARISHA: What does he add? His spell attack
bonus?

2211
03:02:17,006 --> 03:02:24,859
MATT: This? No, this is a d20 and-- let me make
sure, yeah-- it's a d20 and then you add your plus

2212
03:02:24,859 --> 03:02:28,481
five from your charisma.

2213
03:02:28,481 --> 03:02:32,704
SAM: Charisma? That's a natural 20.

2214
03:02:32,704 --> 03:02:34,565
(cheering)

2215
03:02:34,565 --> 03:02:40,773
MATT: With that-- (screeches) pterodactyl.

2216
03:02:40,773 --> 03:02:46,762
LIAM: Tables have turned, motherfucker! Tables
have turned!

2217
03:02:46,762 --> 03:02:48,529
ORION: You're both flying cows!

2218
03:02:48,529 --> 03:02:52,795
LAURA: Wait! Was Seeming a concentration?

2219
03:02:52,795 --> 03:02:55,289
ORION: I think it lasts for like eight hours.

2220
03:02:55,289 --> 03:02:57,363
LAURA: Did it drop? Are we no longer cows?

2221
03:02:57,363 --> 03:03:00,060
SAM: I think so. I'll check.

2222
03:03:00,060 --> 03:03:01,312
LIAM: Hey! You're not a cow anymore!

2223
03:03:01,312 --> 03:03:02,901
LAURA: Oh my god, you're not a cow anymore!

2224
03:03:02,901 --> 03:03:04,180
LIAM: Oh! Awesome!

2225
03:03:04,180 --> 03:03:08,163
MATT: You guys keep flying. You guys catch yourselves.

2226
03:03:08,163 --> 03:03:11,019
SAM: Nope, not concentration. It just lasts for
eight hours.

2227
03:03:11,019 --> 03:03:16,156
MATT: You guys are all still flying cows. You're
all still just a squadron of flying, illusory

2228
03:03:16,156 --> 03:03:24,631
cows, which you guys are both now transformed into
an eagle and a pterodactyl, but you still look

2229
03:03:24,631 --> 03:03:25,575
like cows.

2230
03:03:25,575 --> 03:03:27,508
(laughter)

2231
03:03:27,508 --> 03:03:34,763
LIAM: As the twins are flying, I say, hey, did you
notice we have the same pattern? Twins!

2232
03:03:34,763 --> 03:03:47,070
MATT: About this time, you hear a loud, impactful
boom. And there's a cloud of dust partway into

2233
03:03:47,070 --> 03:03:51,895
the side of this first bit of mountain range that
you come upon, a little bit distant from you

2234
03:03:51,895 --> 03:03:52,862
guys.

2235
03:03:52,862 --> 03:03:54,189
LAURA: Can I fly down towards it?

2236
03:03:54,189 --> 03:03:57,455
MATT: You start heading in that direction. Because
of the speed it was traveling at and the way it

2237
03:03:57,455 --> 03:04:02,748
was carrying at the speed it was going, it's still
ahead of you guys. And you see the impact. You

2238
03:04:02,748 --> 03:04:08,429
hear this loud screeching sound and you see now
where there was a little poof of cloud, these wings

2239
03:04:08,429 --> 03:04:13,737
unfold and (flapping) make its way back up.

2240
03:04:13,737 --> 03:04:15,829
ORION: How far away from it are we?

2241
03:04:15,829 --> 03:04:21,485
MATT: You guys right now at the close to six
minutes you've been traveling--

2242
03:04:21,485 --> 03:04:23,729
MARISHA: Did it not drop the cow to 0 hit points?

2243
03:04:23,729 --> 03:04:27,697
MATT: All the damage carries over.

2244
03:04:27,697 --> 03:04:32,842
LIAM: The remainder of that damage went into its
hit points.

2245
03:04:32,842 --> 03:04:36,471
MATT: You don't know. It looks hurt. It looks like
it wasn't happy about it. It continues back up.

2246
03:04:36,471 --> 03:04:41,809
From you Tiberius, it's probably close to 700 to
800 feet away from you. It's because of the speed

2247
03:04:41,809 --> 03:04:45,015
it was traveling and the speed you guys were
following. It was gaining on you every single

2248
03:04:45,015 --> 03:04:45,738
turn.

2249
03:04:45,738 --> 03:04:46,874
LAURA: Is it flying away from us now?

2250
03:04:46,874 --> 03:04:48,683
MATT: It's heading up into the mountain range.

2251
03:04:48,683 --> 03:04:52,020
LIAM: Fly after that motherfucker!

2252
03:04:52,020 --> 03:04:54,544
LAURA: Should we still track it? It's still
nighttime, right?

2253
03:04:54,544 --> 03:04:56,061
MATT: It's still nighttime, yeah.

2254
03:04:56,061 --> 03:04:57,692
ORION: It's only 500 feet away from me right now?

2255
03:04:57,692 --> 03:04:59,074
MATT: 600 to 500 feet.

2256
03:04:59,074 --> 03:05:00,793
ORION: Okay, cool. Well I'm going for it, still.

2257
03:05:00,793 --> 03:05:02,183
MATT: What are you doing?

2258
03:05:02,183 --> 03:05:03,668
LAURA: We're all following it.

2259
03:05:03,668 --> 03:05:07,281
ORION: Where am I? It's taking off right now and
I'm over here?

2260
03:05:07,281 --> 03:05:12,612
MATT: You're back here. It's now starting to take
off and head up towards the top of this mountain

2261
03:05:12,612 --> 03:05:14,341
range that you're just starting to come upon.

2262
03:05:14,341 --> 03:05:23,296
ORION: Okay. If it's doing that, then I'll fucking
go higher and try to meet it where it's going.

2263
03:05:23,296 --> 03:05:31,797
MATT: Okay. Cool. The rest of you guys continue to
give chase. Now that it's returned to its form, it

2264
03:05:31,797 --> 03:05:41,606
travels an additional double dash: 240 feet. As
this progresses, it's far beyond any of you guys

2265
03:05:41,606 --> 03:05:42,635
in a matter of seconds.

2266
03:05:42,635 --> 03:05:44,233
LAURA: Is the mountain range really far away?

2267
03:05:44,233 --> 03:05:47,418
MATT: No, you've just hit the outskirts of the
mountain range. It got there first. You guys just

2268
03:05:47,418 --> 03:05:51,117
catch up to where it starts and you see it's like
now it's dodging through the mountains and is

2269
03:05:51,117 --> 03:05:55,640
currently no longer in sight. There is a little
bit of low cloud cover in this area. A couple

2270
03:05:55,640 --> 03:05:59,963
drift by and cover a couple of the mountains. But
this little cluster of seaside cliffs and

2271
03:05:59,963 --> 03:06:06,254
mountains, as you get closer, you can see it's
dotted with high altitude trees. There's

2272
03:06:06,254 --> 03:06:09,812
precariously perched goats that are sleeping on
elements of the sides of this mountain.

2273
03:06:09,812 --> 03:06:11,644
LIAM: Can you track it?

2274
03:06:11,644 --> 03:06:13,975
LAURA: I can track it! Of course.

2275
03:06:13,975 --> 03:06:15,766
MATT: So you're keeping your attention on it?

2276
03:06:15,766 --> 03:06:16,938
LAURA: Yes.

2277
03:06:16,938 --> 03:06:21,711
MATT: The winds also are pretty strong as you get
close to the mountains. As you coast around each,

2278
03:06:21,711 --> 03:06:25,322
you start actually diving into this middle valley
area.

2279
03:06:25,322 --> 03:06:27,253
LAURA: I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on
all of us.

2280
03:06:27,253 --> 03:06:28,668
MATT: Okay.

2281
03:06:28,668 --> 03:06:30,729
SAM: Does that affect any spells?

2282
03:06:30,729 --> 03:06:32,524
LAURA: No, it just makes us stealth easier.

2283
03:06:32,524 --> 03:06:33,777
SAM: It doesn't drop Hunter's Mark?

2284
03:06:33,777 --> 03:06:34,929
MATT: Is it concentration?

2285
03:06:34,929 --> 03:06:38,513
LAURA: No, it's not concentration; it's an action.
Oh wait. (laughs) I don't know if I can tell.

2286
03:06:38,513 --> 03:06:40,388
MATT: Is Pass Without a Trace concentration?

2287
03:06:40,388 --> 03:06:41,963
LAURA: Where does it say it?

2288
03:06:41,963 --> 03:06:44,333
SAM: There's a C next to it somewhere.

2289
03:06:44,333 --> 03:06:51,423
LAURA: Oh, never mind! It's a concentration. Forget
it! I don't know how these things work yet.

2290
03:06:51,423 --> 03:06:53,858
SAM: Yeah, stick to the bows and arrows.

2291
03:06:53,858 --> 03:06:57,447
MATT: Traveling through this area, you can see the
mountains. The way that they're constructed in

2292
03:06:57,447 --> 03:07:00,795
this area, it's not a gradual crag. A lot of these
are just punched up in the air, like whatever

2293
03:07:00,795 --> 03:07:07,087
heavy seismic force that created these initially
was very localized and very powerful. A lot of the

2294
03:07:07,087 --> 03:07:11,137
mountains are spire-like. They come up with very
sheer sides and you can see why this mountain

2295
03:07:11,137 --> 03:07:17,740
range is largely not utilized or traversed or
generally spoken of often because it's too

2296
03:07:17,740 --> 03:07:23,719
dangerous for most average folk to even attempt to
climb or use for any good reason. The winds are

2297
03:07:23,719 --> 03:07:28,158
high and powerful here at the tops, as well. And
as you're flying around, the winds blowing across,

2298
03:07:28,158 --> 03:07:32,538
and you get pushed off your course a little bit
here and there, but you still keep up, best as

2299
03:07:32,538 --> 03:07:39,653
possible. You leading the charge. Over about five
minutes of searching through this mountain range,

2300
03:07:39,653 --> 03:07:42,872
you sense that its movement eventually comes to
stop.

2301
03:07:42,872 --> 03:07:44,536
LAURA: Okay.

2302
03:07:44,536 --> 03:07:46,187
TRAVIS: There's a nest.

2303
03:07:46,187 --> 03:07:48,872
SAM: Wait, you sense that he came to a stop?

2304
03:07:48,872 --> 03:07:51,730
LAURA: He came to a stop a little bit ahead of
us.

2305
03:07:51,730 --> 03:07:54,224
SAM: Let's go get him.

2306
03:07:54,224 --> 03:07:57,140
LAURA: Can we all try to stealth in?

2307
03:07:57,140 --> 03:08:00,175
SAM: I'm a pterodactyl, so--

2308
03:08:00,175 --> 03:08:02,729
MARISHA: Yeah, let's go for the element of
surprise. Well, technically, we're all still

2309
03:08:02,729 --> 03:08:03,967
cows.

2310
03:08:03,967 --> 03:08:07,818
MATT: Yes. And you guys cannot talk because you're
actually in creature forms.

2311
03:08:07,818 --> 03:08:14,009
LAURA: All right. Well, I'm going to try to
stealth. Mountains are my favored terrain!

2312
03:08:14,009 --> 03:08:19,202
MATT: They are! Do you want to go onto the
mountain itself, or are you still flying amongst

2313
03:08:19,202 --> 03:08:19,995
them?

2314
03:08:19,995 --> 03:08:21,583
LAURA: Oh, I'll still fly.

2315
03:08:21,583 --> 03:08:26,955
MATT: So you would not get the advantage because
air is not your favored terrain. So everyone who

2316
03:08:26,955 --> 03:08:29,275
wishes to, go ahead and roll stealth checks

2317
03:08:29,275 --> 03:08:30,573
MARISHA: All of us?

2318
03:08:30,573 --> 03:08:33,416
MATT: All of you who wish to try and come at it
from a quiet--

2319
03:08:33,416 --> 03:08:36,489
SAM: (pterodactyl screech)

2320
03:08:36,489 --> 03:08:40,518
MATT: What did you roll?

2321
03:08:40,518 --> 03:08:43,130
LIAM: With advantage, I rolled a two.

2322
03:08:43,130 --> 03:08:45,103
MATT: Okay.

2323
03:08:45,103 --> 03:08:47,884
LIAM: I'm not used to being flying, really.

2324
03:08:47,884 --> 03:08:51,163
SAM: Five.

2325
03:08:51,163 --> 03:08:53,202
ORION: Are we flying anymore?

2326
03:08:53,202 --> 03:08:54,965
MATT: You guys are all still flying, yeah.

2327
03:08:54,965 --> 03:08:58,488
ORION: Oh, shit. Okay. Oh, no.

2328
03:08:58,488 --> 03:09:00,126
MARISHA: 21.

2329
03:09:00,126 --> 03:09:01,300
TRAVIS: 14.

2330
03:09:01,300 --> 03:09:02,559
LAURA: 28.

2331
03:09:02,559 --> 03:09:09,988
MATT: Yeah, so. You guys following behind Vex, many
of you clumsily and some of you shouting out to

2332
03:09:10,047 --> 03:09:17,191
each other, "I think she sees it this way." And
you're like, "oh my god." You come around this one

2333
03:09:17,191 --> 03:09:21,805
bend and you can see one of the larger mountainous
spires that has a lot of trees and green growth

2334
03:09:21,805 --> 03:09:26,606
towards the top at certain places where the rock
juts out and gives a shelf for such greenery to

2335
03:09:26,606 --> 03:09:34,490
grow, outside of its sheer outside surface. You do
see a couple of wings fold in against the

2336
03:09:34,490 --> 03:09:39,384
moonlight in what looks to be an outcropping. And
there are multiple layers of rock shelves on the

2337
03:09:39,384 --> 03:09:43,030
side of this mountain. And on one of these
outcroppings, there appears to be some sort of a

2338
03:09:43,030 --> 03:09:50,367
nest: a cluster of almost like actual trees and
pieces of wood that are all jammed into this giant

2339
03:09:50,367 --> 03:09:55,997
nest that's nestled against where the shadow and
the moonlight are fighting for some sort of visual

2340
03:09:55,997 --> 03:09:57,179
on it.

2341
03:09:57,179 --> 03:09:58,589
TRAVIS: Big-ass tree fortress.

2342
03:09:58,589 --> 03:10:01,427
LAURA: Did we just find like a mama bird and baby
birds?

2343
03:10:01,427 --> 03:10:03,042
MARISHA: Yeah, we did.

2344
03:10:03,042 --> 03:10:04,466
LAURA: What are we going to do?

2345
03:10:04,466 --> 03:10:07,090
LIAM: We're going to take out the mom and train
the babies.

2346
03:10:07,090 --> 03:10:11,832
SAM: What are we going to do?

2347
03:10:11,832 --> 03:10:15,380
LIAM: Yeah. We're going to capture those babies
and we're going to train them.

2348
03:10:15,380 --> 03:10:18,815
ORION: That's a good idea. I like that idea.

2349
03:10:18,815 --> 03:10:20,056
SAM: Like Avatar?

2350
03:10:20,056 --> 03:10:21,350
ORION: Yes.

2351
03:10:21,350 --> 03:10:23,261
TRAVIS: You could go in.

2352
03:10:23,261 --> 03:10:27,832
LAURA: Me go in? There's a giant fucking nest
here! I get close to it. As close as I feel safe

2353
03:10:27,832 --> 03:10:29,039
getting to it.

2354
03:10:29,039 --> 03:10:30,828
MATT: You guys all stay back or do you go with
her?

2355
03:10:30,828 --> 03:10:34,887
ORION: I'm going to cast Greater Invisibility on
myself and then follow.

2356
03:10:34,887 --> 03:10:38,628
MATT: Okay. You guys have 12 seconds before you
all plummet.

2357
03:10:38,628 --> 03:10:42,464
ORION: Oh wait! No! I don't do that. Damn it! I
forget we're still flying.

2358
03:10:42,464 --> 03:10:46,263
TRAVIS: What part of the flying part did you
forget?

2359
03:10:46,263 --> 03:10:48,261
ORION: I thought we'd landed already.

2360
03:10:48,261 --> 03:10:52,793
MATT: Are you guys all going with Vex, or are you
all staying back and she's going on her own?

2361
03:10:52,793 --> 03:10:54,605
TRAVIS: Are we going to lose Fly, or do we keep
it?

2362
03:10:54,605 --> 03:10:56,390
MATT: Are you casting Greater Invisibility?

2363
03:10:56,390 --> 03:10:57,383
ORION: No.

2364
03:10:57,383 --> 03:10:58,948
MATT: Then no, you're fine.

2365
03:10:58,948 --> 03:11:01,959
LIAM: Is it the same stealth roll or an additional
stealth roll to go forward at this point?

2366
03:11:01,959 --> 03:11:03,815
MATT: No this was your stealth roll on
approaching.

2367
03:11:03,815 --> 03:11:06,290
LIAM: Oh. Well, I mean, I knew I rolled
shitty.

2368
03:11:06,335 --> 03:11:07,773
MATT: You don't know you rolled shitty.

2369
03:11:07,773 --> 03:11:09,263
TRAVIS: I'm going in.

2370
03:11:09,263 --> 03:11:18,202
MATT: All right. So Vex and Grog, you approach.
Gliding cows, drifting through the night sky.

2371
03:11:18,202 --> 03:11:20,174
LAURA: This is so stupid.

2372
03:11:20,174 --> 03:11:21,597
TRAVIS: Hoof in hoof.

2373
03:11:21,597 --> 03:11:27,879
MATT: Okay, yeah. So you guys all realize you must
keep close together to Tiberius as you come in.

2374
03:11:27,879 --> 03:11:33,815
Keeping too much of a distance would be a bad
thing. You come upon the underneath portion of

2375
03:11:33,815 --> 03:11:39,099
this outcropping, and you can see within a quick
glance-- go ahead and make a perception check, all

2376
03:11:39,099 --> 03:11:40,082
of you guys.

2377
03:11:40,082 --> 03:11:41,263
MARISHA: All of us?

2378
03:11:41,263 --> 03:11:43,680
MATT: All of you who are coming up in this
cluster.

2379
03:11:43,680 --> 03:11:44,919
TRAVIS: Three.

2380
03:11:44,919 --> 03:11:48,934
LAURA: Do I get an advantage because we're in a
mountain environment at all?

2381
03:11:48,934 --> 03:11:52,990
MATT: Nope. Actually no. Because you're seeing
things on a mountain, I will give you advantage on

2382
03:11:52,990 --> 03:11:53,821
this.

2383
03:11:53,821 --> 03:11:54,691
LAURA: Yes!

2384
03:11:54,691 --> 03:11:57,047
MARISHA: 12.

2385
03:11:57,047 --> 03:11:58,340
MATT: 12?

2386
03:11:58,340 --> 03:11:59,694
ORION: 16.

2387
03:11:59,694 --> 03:12:01,118
SAM: Nothing.

2388
03:12:01,118 --> 03:12:02,194
LIAM: 13.

2389
03:12:02,194 --> 03:12:04,141
LAURA: 12.

2390
03:12:04,141 --> 03:12:06,306
MATT: So the highest was?

2391
03:12:06,306 --> 03:12:07,433
ORION: 16.

2392
03:12:07,433 --> 03:12:09,931
MATT: 16. You got?

2393
03:12:09,931 --> 03:12:11,029
TRAVIS: Three.

2394
03:12:11,029 --> 03:12:16,927
MATT: As you guys all look up, it's very shadowy
over here. It's hard to see. The moonlight's in

2395
03:12:16,927 --> 03:12:20,871
your eye a little bit and the darkness is so
pitch. The umbra of this particular shadow is very

2396
03:12:20,871 --> 03:12:29,116
dark and crushed. You make out, in the nest, the
large bird creature has folded its wings and is

2397
03:12:29,116 --> 03:12:36,057
currently leaning down. And you see something
in the nest that's much smaller moving up next to it.

2398
03:12:36,057 --> 03:12:39,728
MARISHA: I don't want to kill a mama.

2399
03:12:39,728 --> 03:12:42,983
LAURA: But she's killing the farmers' stuff.

2400
03:12:42,983 --> 03:12:46,513
MARISHA: Maybe we can transplant her.

2401
03:12:46,513 --> 03:12:50,322
SAM: To a wildlife preserve?

2402
03:12:50,322 --> 03:12:52,381
LAURA: Maybe. And her babies?

2403
03:12:52,381 --> 03:12:55,790
MARISHA: Capture her and move her away from town?

2404
03:12:55,790 --> 03:12:58,854
LIAM: That seems complicated.

2405
03:12:58,854 --> 03:13:01,389
SAM: Are they on the highest peak?

2406
03:13:01,389 --> 03:13:06,187
MATT: No. There's two other levels up above this.
This one just is one of the largest outcroppings.

2407
03:13:06,187 --> 03:13:11,501
SAM: I'm going to swoop up over them. See if
there's any boulders to drop.

2408
03:13:11,501 --> 03:13:21,561
MATT: Okay. Looking over it, there are no loose
rocks or boulders. In fact, because of the

2409
03:13:21,561 --> 03:13:26,314
construction of these mountains, they're solid
spires that jut up and then abruptly end. All the

2410
03:13:26,314 --> 03:13:29,435
erosion that happens here appears to be gradual
enough-- that's why the sides of the mountains are

2411
03:13:29,435 --> 03:13:31,360
so smooth and unclimbable.

2412
03:13:31,360 --> 03:13:36,751
MARISHA: So there's a sheer peak and they're
nested on the side of it?

2413
03:13:36,751 --> 03:13:39,975
MATT: Yeah. It's a sheer peak that rounds off at
the very top and there are little outcroppings

2414
03:13:39,975 --> 03:13:43,609
that jut out in places as it goes down. But those
are more towards the top, and as you go down

2415
03:13:43,609 --> 03:13:48,599
further-- as most of the erosion hits the mountain
lower and lower, it has carved off or destroyed

2416
03:13:48,599 --> 03:13:52,524
most of what would have been previous outcroppings,
or smoothed them over.

2417
03:13:52,524 --> 03:13:54,579
TRAVIS: How far away are we now?

2418
03:13:54,579 --> 03:14:00,975
MATT: You guys are probably a good 60 or 50 feet
if you're trying to get up within range of your

2419
03:14:00,975 --> 03:14:05,116
Fly. Right? What's the range of on that? Fly?

2420
03:14:05,116 --> 03:14:11,628
SAM: Fly? Oh, here.

2421
03:14:11,628 --> 03:14:22,409
MATT: I got it. No! There is no range on it. You
just touch them. So you're fine. Yeah. As long as

2422
03:14:22,409 --> 03:14:24,051
you're concentrating on it, you're fine.

2423
03:14:24,051 --> 03:14:26,731
TRAVIS: So we're within 60 feet?

2424
03:14:26,731 --> 03:14:31,789
MATT: Well, you guys have been keeping a little
more of a distance down here. However, at this

2425
03:14:31,789 --> 03:14:38,445
point, as you guys are all encroaching and
Scanlan's gone overhead, a voice rings out against

2426
03:14:38,445 --> 03:14:51,539
the darkness, "Flying cows? Really? I care not for
this insolence. If you've come to mock me or fight

2427
03:14:51,539 --> 03:14:56,864
"me, do it now! Or leave this creature alone!"

2428
03:14:56,864 --> 03:15:02,964
LAURA: What? Where are you? Who are you? Who said
that?

2429
03:15:02,964 --> 03:15:08,889
ORION: I rolled an arcana check of 17 of my
surroundings-- where it's coming from.

2430
03:15:08,889 --> 03:15:11,492
LAURA: Ditto. I try to perceive where it's coming
from.

2431
03:15:11,492 --> 03:15:16,039
MATT: Okay. Arcana check-- there's nothing arcane
in nature. It's not omnipresent or coming from any

2432
03:15:16,039 --> 03:15:19,282
certain place. There is a direction it's coming
from, which is from the outcropping or nest area.

2433
03:15:19,282 --> 03:15:26,699
There's nothing arcane in nature to it. It's in
the shadow. You can't really see it from this

2434
03:15:26,699 --> 03:15:27,800
distance.

2435
03:15:27,800 --> 03:15:30,054
LAURA: Is it in front of us? To the side of us? Is
it coming from where the bird seems to be?

2436
03:15:30,054 --> 03:15:31,655
MATT: It's coming from where the bird is.

2437
03:15:31,655 --> 03:15:33,539
LIAM: He's controlling it.

2438
03:15:33,539 --> 03:15:39,615
MARISHA: I fly over as an eagle.

2439
03:15:39,615 --> 03:15:43,016
LAURA: You still look like a cow eagle.

2440
03:15:43,016 --> 03:15:44,500
MARISHA: Can we drop Seeming?

2441
03:15:44,500 --> 03:15:48,997
MATT: It's not under your control, and you can't
talk, too.

2442
03:15:48,997 --> 03:15:54,745
TRAVIS: Okay. I yell out, you've been stealing the
farmers' livestock. Give us a reason not to kill

2443
03:15:54,745 --> 03:15:55,539
you.

2444
03:15:55,539 --> 03:15:58,637
SAM: That's good. That's good. Diplomacy.

2445
03:15:58,637 --> 03:16:00,604
ORION: Or, I mean, moo!

2446
03:16:00,604 --> 03:16:09,853
MATT: Okay. You guys are all keeping distance from
it? The voice comes out again, "Your nature

2447
03:16:09,853 --> 03:16:16,473
"confuses me and your words seem ill-informed. If
you're not going to come to speak of discourse,

2448
03:16:16,473 --> 03:16:19,426
"I'm going to assume that that you're my enemy."

2449
03:16:19,426 --> 03:16:21,399
ORION: Then, as he's saying that, I'll approach.

2450
03:16:21,399 --> 03:16:24,663
MATT: So Tiberius cow goes.

2451
03:16:24,663 --> 03:16:30,234
ORION: And as I approach the thing, I'm going to
Dispel Magic on myself.

2452
03:16:30,234 --> 03:16:39,195
MATT: Okay. Cool. For Dispel Magic, I need you to
go ahead, just for the sake of this-- I won't

2453
03:16:39,195 --> 03:16:44,753
consider it contested because you're allies in
this thing. So you land. Tiberius' form shimmers

2454
03:16:44,753 --> 03:16:50,509
and returns back to that of a dragonborn, and
you're standing there on the precipice. Go ahead

2455
03:16:50,509 --> 03:16:52,699
and roll a perception check.

2456
03:16:52,699 --> 03:16:55,391
ORION: What is that? 11.

2457
03:16:55,391 --> 03:17:00,846
MATT: Okay. It's hard to make out the details, but
the voice is definitely coming from the nest. You

2458
03:17:00,846 --> 03:17:07,004
see there is something vaguely humanoid, but it's
hard to make out the shape at this distance with

2459
03:17:07,004 --> 03:17:16,080
this low light, especially since you aren't a
darkvision-gifted entity. However, it's close to

2460
03:17:16,080 --> 03:17:17,654
this bird creature.

2461
03:17:17,654 --> 03:17:23,287
ORION: I'm going to say, is this big bird thing
asleep?

2462
03:17:23,287 --> 03:17:28,605
MATT: "You will not harm this creature,
poachers!"

2463
03:17:28,605 --> 03:17:32,478
ORION: I'm not trying to harm it at all. I'm just
seeing if it's fine. If we could talk. I can't see

2464
03:17:32,478 --> 03:17:36,602
anything, and I wanted to cast Light so I could
see something, but I don't want to hurt your

2465
03:17:36,602 --> 03:17:37,822
bird's eyes.

2466
03:17:37,822 --> 03:17:44,068
MATT: You can see the bird's moving and it's
looking towards your direction. And it has this

2467
03:17:44,068 --> 03:17:46,105
like (soft snarl).

2468
03:17:46,105 --> 03:17:47,694
ORION: So it's awake?

2469
03:17:47,694 --> 03:17:54,926
MATT: It's awake, and it looks hurt. The voice is
like, "You come here masqueraded as whatever

2470
03:17:54,926 --> 03:17:57,487
"manner of beasts that you are--"

2471
03:17:57,487 --> 03:17:59,375
ORION: Cows. We were cows.

2472
03:17:59,375 --> 03:18:05,107
MATT: "After tormenting and severely wounding this
beautiful creature."

2473
03:18:05,107 --> 03:18:12,308
ORION: We didn't do anything to the creature. No,
we were-- This creature was stealing the farmer's

2474
03:18:12,308 --> 03:18:17,562
cows, and the farmers were saying, "You've taken
our livestock," which is hurting the farm. We came

2475
03:18:17,562 --> 03:18:20,792
to help them and we posed as cows, and then your
bird took our--

2476
03:18:20,792 --> 03:18:23,880
LIAM: While he's blithering, can I make an
additional cow stealth check?

2477
03:18:23,880 --> 03:18:25,456
MATT: To?

2478
03:18:25,456 --> 03:18:31,502
LIAM: To come up behind the guy. Near him. Not
even near him. Just to get a better vantage point.

2479
03:18:31,502 --> 03:18:34,160
MATT: Go for it. Make it with a disadvantage.

2480
03:18:34,160 --> 03:18:37,496
LIAM: Does that cancel out with my advantage from
my cloak?

2481
03:18:37,496 --> 03:18:39,583
LAURA: A cow in a cloak.

2482
03:18:39,583 --> 03:18:44,406
MATT: You are a flying cow in the moonlight
against an individual that is very aware of your

2483
03:18:44,406 --> 03:18:45,356
presence.

2484
03:18:45,356 --> 03:18:46,938
LIAM: Shut up, baby, I know it.

2485
03:18:46,938 --> 03:18:48,352
(laughter)

2486
03:18:48,352 --> 03:18:50,793
LIAM: That is good.

2487
03:18:50,793 --> 03:18:57,181
LAURA: That's 31.

2488
03:18:57,181 --> 03:18:58,637
LIAM: Yeah. 31.

2489
03:18:58,637 --> 03:19:08,289
MATT: (chuckles) You stealthily cow your way up to
the side of this precipice. Seemingly unnoticed.

2490
03:19:08,289 --> 03:19:19,031
Getting a view of this creature now, you can see this
nest is a cluster of driftwood and chunks of

2491
03:19:19,031 --> 03:19:25,031
shipwreck and carts and wagon wheels and whatever
pieces of wood have been scavenged from different

2492
03:19:25,031 --> 03:19:30,561
time periods. Some are weathered, some are more
fresh. And trees, whole trees that are broken and

2493
03:19:30,561 --> 03:19:38,638
shredded have all been cobbled together to make
this nest. In the center of this-- I'm going to

2494
03:19:38,638 --> 03:19:45,814
take the intensity down on this a little bit-- you
see, there up against this bird-- and the bird

2495
03:19:45,814 --> 03:19:52,703
itself is twitching and looks like it's hurt. Not
deeply hurt, but hurt. You see a small humanoid.

2496
03:19:52,703 --> 03:19:59,446
Pretty small. Scanlan small. Hard to make out
details, but it is currently in the process of

2497
03:19:59,446 --> 03:20:06,607
doing a repeated hand motion and then touching. A
hand motion and then touching. And you've seen

2498
03:20:06,607 --> 03:20:08,450
this motion before.

2499
03:20:08,450 --> 03:20:09,588
LIAM: Touching what?

2500
03:20:09,588 --> 03:20:16,000
MATT: Touching the bird. There is a perpetual
string of Cure Wounds being applied to this bird.

2501
03:20:16,000 --> 03:20:22,254
MARISHA: I also approach and come out of my eagle
form.

2502
03:20:22,254 --> 03:20:23,419
ORION: Light.

2503
03:20:23,419 --> 03:20:24,870
SAM: Are you landing somewhere?

2504
03:20:24,870 --> 03:20:26,138
MARISHA: Next to Tiberius.

2505
03:20:26,138 --> 03:20:30,958
ORION: But I'm going to block it with my hand so
it's not going to blind the bird.

2506
03:20:30,958 --> 03:20:36,971
MATT: Okay.  As the light picks up, you can see
the bird turns away for a second and starts to

2507
03:20:36,971 --> 03:20:44,924
like flap its wings instinctually. And once again,
seeing it up close, this bird is really big. The

2508
03:20:44,924 --> 03:20:55,052
humanoid entity becomes immediately visible. And
it is a gnome. You can see, he's dressed in hides

2509
03:20:55,052 --> 03:21:00,198
and roughly crafted leather and furs. He has
tousled, greasy black hair that hangs past his

2510
03:21:00,198 --> 03:21:09,329
shoulders, covering a bedraggled and bearded face.
Holding up his arm-- and looks thin. It's covering

2511
03:21:09,329 --> 03:21:11,701
the light and he's like, "You!"

2512
03:21:11,701 --> 03:21:18,776
ORION: Sorry. I tried to not blind you. It was
very dark. I'm sorry. Hello. We mean you no harm.

2513
03:21:18,776 --> 03:21:27,742
MATT: The gnome slams this small wooden, for lack
of a better term, a small staff or cane. Slams it

2514
03:21:27,742 --> 03:21:33,943
into the ground with a foot stomp and you can see
the gnome's entire body suddenly begin to shift

2515
03:21:33,943 --> 03:21:37,727
and change into this dark, gnarled-looking, hard
surface.

2516
03:21:37,727 --> 03:21:40,422
LIAM: I whack him in the back of the head.

2517
03:21:40,422 --> 03:21:43,022
LAURA: No! It's just Barkskin! It's just defense!

2518
03:21:43,022 --> 03:21:50,201
MATT: He doesn't know. All right. So you cow
stealth up to the side of this guy.

2519
03:21:50,201 --> 03:21:52,051
LIAM: Let's get ready to rumble.

2520
03:21:52,051 --> 03:21:55,919
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make an attack.

2521
03:21:55,919 --> 03:21:57,583
LIAM: I pause.

2522
03:21:57,583 --> 03:22:09,023
MATT: You pause? You are currently now crouched
right behind the edge of this nest, and you can't

2523
03:22:09,023 --> 03:22:14,426
even actually see the guy anymore because in order
to get up there, you've come underneath to stay

2524
03:22:14,426 --> 03:22:16,186
hidden and you're just there behind.

2525
03:22:16,186 --> 03:22:17,629
MARISHA: Can I see Vax?

2526
03:22:17,629 --> 03:22:23,594
MATT: No. Well, actually go ahead and roll a
perception check. Is it higher than a 31?

2527
03:22:23,594 --> 03:22:29,201
MARISHA: Is it higher than a 31? No.

2528
03:22:29,201 --> 03:22:31,243
MATT: You have no idea where Vax is.

2529
03:22:31,243 --> 03:22:34,469
SAM: I'm way up above them still, right? Do I see
anything?

2530
03:22:34,469 --> 03:22:39,893
MATT: No, actually. You see, there's another
section above there. It looks like there's nothing

2531
03:22:39,893 --> 03:22:43,372
else of interest, other than some growth, a few
bushes, and some vines that hang down the side.

2532
03:22:43,372 --> 03:22:46,333
TRAVIS: Somebody talk to him before I kill this
fucking bird.

2533
03:22:46,333 --> 03:22:49,213
ORION: I am talking to him.

2534
03:22:49,213 --> 03:22:55,516
MARISHA: I land beside Tiberius and come out of
eagle form. Tiberius, would you please Dispel this

2535
03:22:55,516 --> 03:23:02,906
cow form from me. Please? Thank you.

2536
03:23:02,906 --> 03:23:09,245
MATT: Okay. And with that, you cast Dispel Magic
and Keyleth's form reverts that to Keyleth. Normal

2537
03:23:09,245 --> 03:23:13,946
Keyleth. Non-cow Keyleth. The gnome character now
has the staff at the back and has a hand in front

2538
03:23:13,946 --> 03:23:15,728
and is like, (panting).

2539
03:23:15,728 --> 03:23:24,793
MARISHA: Are you a druid? I'm also a druid. I
think our goals might be aligned.

2540
03:23:24,793 --> 03:23:26,789
MATT: "Really?"

2541
03:23:26,789 --> 03:23:32,641
MARISHA: It's okay. What's her name?

2542
03:23:32,641 --> 03:23:45,861
MATT: "This creature has no name to it yet. I,
myself, am a protector of the wild, as you claim

2543
03:23:45,861 --> 03:23:53,203
"to be, as well. I have no tribe but the trees
around me. I hear the whisper of the wind, and it

2544
03:23:53,203 --> 03:23:54,715
"calls for justice."

2545
03:23:54,715 --> 03:23:59,015
MARISHA: I can relate to that.

2546
03:23:59,015 --> 03:24:04,919
MATT: "Then why do you follow? Why do you insist
on harming this creature?"

2547
03:24:04,919 --> 03:24:09,147
MARISHA: Because we were seeking justice for other
people.

2548
03:24:09,147 --> 03:24:14,505
MATT: "Why? For the civilized folk of the city?
You should know more than most. They sit there,

2549
03:24:14,505 --> 03:24:20,889
"taking beautiful creatures of nature, making them
fat and formless and worth nothing. To

2550
03:24:20,889 --> 03:24:24,496
"slaughter them without life and purpose to their
existence."

2551
03:24:24,496 --> 03:24:27,949
ORION: The life and purpose of their existence is
to keep those other people alive.

2552
03:24:27,949 --> 03:24:33,629
MATT: "And why is it not the same with this
creature? If they cannot guard their livestock,

2553
03:24:33,629 --> 03:24:38,667
"why is it not food for this thing, as well? It is
the natural life cycle that they've removed

2554
03:24:38,667 --> 03:24:40,093
"themselves from."

2555
03:24:40,093 --> 03:24:44,397
ORION: When one has an establishment, when one
grows its own crop, and one steals something, it

2556
03:24:44,397 --> 03:24:45,878
is considered a crime.

2557
03:24:45,878 --> 03:24:49,863
MATT: "Well, when one is not part of that
civilization, but the civilization of the world as

2558
03:24:49,863 --> 03:24:56,787
"a whole, which requires hunting for what keeps you
alive, perhaps that does not sink or hang on my

2559
03:24:56,787 --> 03:24:57,773
"conscience."

2560
03:24:57,773 --> 03:24:59,022
ORION: Fair point.

2561
03:24:59,022 --> 03:25:05,991
MARISHA: Let's not let this escalate. Okay? What
is your name?

2562
03:25:05,991 --> 03:25:08,908
MATT: "I was once called Byron."

2563
03:25:08,908 --> 03:25:10,370
MARISHA: Vyron?

2564
03:25:10,370 --> 03:25:11,275
MATT: "Byron."

2565
03:25:11,275 --> 03:25:12,265
MARISHA: Byron.

2566
03:25:12,265 --> 03:25:16,486
MATT: "I have not heard my name nor spoken words
for many years."

2567
03:25:16,486 --> 03:25:21,326
ORION: Would you not like to be called Byron, or
would you like something else, like B-roy or

2568
03:25:21,326 --> 03:25:31,902
B-man? My name's Tiberius Stormwind from Draconia.
And this is my friend Keyleth, who is also a

2569
03:25:31,902 --> 03:25:35,822
druid. And we also have a friend who is a gnome
who sings songs and whatnot.

2570
03:25:35,822 --> 03:25:43,540
MATT: The bird, now looking of much better health
than it was when it arrived, now flutters its

2571
03:25:43,540 --> 03:25:49,181
wings out in a stretching motion. And as it does,
its head glides down and looks right towards you.

2572
03:25:49,181 --> 03:25:52,555
This giant beak that looks like it could snap you
in two with a single bite.

2573
03:25:52,555 --> 03:26:00,648
MARISHA: I reach up to it and reach out to pet its
beak.

2574
03:26:00,648 --> 03:26:07,154
MATT: I'm going to ask you to make an animal
handling check on this. Just to see where this

2575
03:26:07,154 --> 03:26:08,085
goes.

2576
03:26:08,085 --> 03:26:11,926
MARISHA: Okay.

2577
03:26:11,926 --> 03:26:16,410
SAM: I gently start swooping down to check on my
friends.

2578
03:26:16,410 --> 03:26:19,459
MARISHA: 19.

2579
03:26:19,459 --> 03:26:34,550
MATT: All right. The large bird-type creature
retracts from your attempted touch and begins to

2580
03:26:34,550 --> 03:26:39,804
rear back into the nest in a defensive position.
Doesn't bite your hand off.

2581
03:26:39,804 --> 03:26:54,522
MARISHA: I kneel down a bit. Produce a few
Goodberries. Reach out.

2582
03:26:54,522 --> 03:27:07,799
SAM: Bye, Keyleth. This is how we lose one of our
members. Feeding a bird.

2583
03:27:07,799 --> 03:27:13,186
MATT: The creature leans forward and the
giant bird, you can see its dark, black eyes

2584
03:27:13,186 --> 03:27:20,587
staring at you. Each eye probably about the size
of your torso. As the giant beak comes down, you

2585
03:27:20,587 --> 03:27:32,820
can see the moonlight gliding off the smooth
exterior of the dark black beak. It smells. And

2586
03:27:32,820 --> 03:27:43,476
you take 27 points of piercing damage as the
animal takes the Goodberries and almost your

2587
03:27:43,476 --> 03:27:47,795
entire hand with it, as well. At that size, it's
hard to be gentle.

2588
03:27:47,795 --> 03:27:50,844
MARISHA: It's okay. It's all right.

2589
03:27:50,844 --> 03:27:57,151
MATT: So you retract your hand, which is now
essentially in many ways, bones are broken, feels

2590
03:27:57,151 --> 03:28:02,464
like. There's blood streaming down the side of
your hand, and (dripping).

2591
03:28:02,464 --> 03:28:04,584
MARISHA: That's a good girl.

2592
03:28:04,584 --> 03:28:07,321
SAM: Is it?

2593
03:28:07,321 --> 03:28:08,522
MATT: Swallows.

2594
03:28:08,522 --> 03:28:09,967
SAM: Is it a good girl?

2595
03:28:09,967 --> 03:28:11,605
ORION: I'm feeding a tiny snack to Lockheed.

2596
03:28:11,605 --> 03:28:15,157
MARISHA: I turn back to Byron--

2597
03:28:15,157 --> 03:28:17,974
SAM: And say, ow.

2598
03:28:17,974 --> 03:28:38,186
MARISHA: Yeah, and go, that hurt. Now. Please
listen to me. Please, please listen to me. We did

2599
03:28:38,186 --> 03:28:40,709
come here to kill the giant creature.

2600
03:28:40,709 --> 03:28:42,964
MATT: "I had assumed."

2601
03:28:42,964 --> 03:28:52,403
MARISHA: But upon seeing the situation, upon
approach, realized the situation and decided

2602
03:28:52,403 --> 03:28:59,131
amongst all of us that we did not want to bring
such a great creature to its death.

2603
03:28:59,131 --> 03:29:05,864
MATT: Scanlan, you've landed by now. A
pterodactyl. A cow-looking pterodactyl.

2604
03:29:05,864 --> 03:29:09,456
ORION: As he swoops, I've never seen anything
quite like it.

2605
03:29:09,456 --> 03:29:11,059
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

2606
03:29:11,059 --> 03:29:13,119
ORION: I'm going to aid her, too.

2607
03:29:13,119 --> 03:29:16,751
SAM: All I've seen so far is Keyleth's bloody
hand.

2608
03:29:16,751 --> 03:29:18,391
MARISHA: 20 total.

2609
03:29:18,391 --> 03:29:22,560
MATT: You have advantage on this because Tiberius
is aiding you on this conversation.

2610
03:29:22,560 --> 03:29:24,569
MARISHA: I'll take that 20 total.

2611
03:29:24,569 --> 03:29:38,745
MATT: All right. He looks at you. "Well, shall you
leave us, then?"

2612
03:29:38,745 --> 03:29:41,647
MARISHA: Under one condition.

2613
03:29:41,647 --> 03:29:48,052
MATT: "There's always a condition. You call
yourself a druid, yet you speak like the civilized

2614
03:29:48,052 --> 03:29:54,054
"folk. I get the feeling that perhaps your
connection to nature has not been tended to for

2615
03:29:54,054 --> 03:29:55,174
"some time."

2616
03:29:55,174 --> 03:29:59,140
ORION: No, she really knows her stuff. I mean, we
just fought this fire guy--

2617
03:29:59,140 --> 03:30:07,232
MARISHA: Just because one can appreciate nature,
does not mean that one cannot also appreciate

2618
03:30:07,232 --> 03:30:08,480
humanity.

2619
03:30:08,480 --> 03:30:18,817
MATT: "Well, this beautiful creature is the only
surviving young of a clutch, bred by a majestic

2620
03:30:18,878 --> 03:30:27,103
"roc high in the Cliffkeep Mountains. Its mother
now lies dead, slain by the brutal giants that

2621
03:30:27,103 --> 03:30:36,434
"wander those peaks. This young'un is all that
remains of that clutch and the memory of that

2622
03:30:36,434 --> 03:30:37,637
"blessed entity."

2623
03:30:37,637 --> 03:30:39,145
TRAVIS: That's a young'un?

2624
03:30:39,145 --> 03:30:47,752
MATT: This is a young one. "This new home serves
us well. Abundance of feed. Lack of large,

2625
03:30:47,752 --> 03:30:51,834
"predatory creatures. I believe this is where we'll
stay."

2626
03:30:51,834 --> 03:31:00,564
MARISHA: Question. If this is a young, adolescent
creature, what do you think of the destruction it

2627
03:31:00,564 --> 03:31:07,570
could cause once it reaches full adulthood? Are
you okay with having that on your conscience? This

2628
03:31:07,570 --> 03:31:18,980
creature could result in the lives of many. If you
relocate out of town, just a few miles. Say like

2629
03:31:18,980 --> 03:31:24,260
50 or 100 or so because this thing's really damn
big. So I'm sure it's got a pretty big-- you know

2630
03:31:24,260 --> 03:31:25,669
what I mean.

2631
03:31:25,669 --> 03:31:27,335
ORION: Or just the other way.

2632
03:31:27,335 --> 03:31:33,167
MARISHA: I will help you. I will personally come
with you and tend to their safety. And make sure

2633
03:31:33,167 --> 03:31:41,747
that their location is proper and safe, and
handled with respect. Then you will be out of the

2634
03:31:41,747 --> 03:31:47,477
harms of poachers. You can live off the land, and
you can be free and alone.

2635
03:31:47,477 --> 03:31:53,770
MATT: "Do you think we came straight to this
mountain range? Do you think this is the first

2636
03:31:53,770 --> 03:32:04,462
"nest we've constructed? Me and this lone survivor
have scoured the length of this side of Tal'Dorei.

2637
03:32:04,462 --> 03:32:12,726
"This, as far as I can see, is the safest. It's the
most ignored by nearby civilization."

2638
03:32:12,726 --> 03:32:14,562
MARISHA: Listen--

2639
03:32:14,562 --> 03:32:22,049
SAM: I'm going to drop Seeming and also drop my
form of pterodactyl.

2640
03:32:22,049 --> 03:32:28,055
MATT: All of you now, your forms change. As this
happens mid-sentence, it's noticed immediately by

2641
03:32:28,055 --> 03:32:30,686
the gnome druid, who's like (gasps).

2642
03:32:30,686 --> 03:32:39,896
MARISHA: Yes! That is correct. Listen. We are
being nice. Don't think that we will be the first.

2643
03:32:39,896 --> 03:32:49,189
You will have more people come and hunt you and
kill this, as this beast continues. How long do

2644
03:32:49,189 --> 03:32:56,308
you think you can survive waves of mercenaries
coming to try and kill this? We are the nice ones.

2645
03:32:56,308 --> 03:33:04,734
I suggest you heed our warning, take our help, and
save the life of you and your creature in the long

2646
03:33:04,734 --> 03:33:05,817
run.

2647
03:33:05,817 --> 03:33:11,076
MATT: "You have yet to provide a suitable
alternative."

2648
03:33:11,076 --> 03:33:12,754
ORION: Oh! I might have an idea.

2649
03:33:12,754 --> 03:33:17,928
MARISHA: There is an alternative. Tiberius can
tell you of that alternative.

2650
03:33:17,928 --> 03:33:23,120
ORION: Yes! See, your creature is rather large and
powerful, yes? You have a rather strong bond with

2651
03:33:23,120 --> 03:33:26,490
him, which is quite unique with such a unique
looking creature.

2652
03:33:26,490 --> 03:33:29,601
MARISHA: I was setting you up for an awesome
one-liner, man! You were supposed to be like, the

2653
03:33:29,601 --> 03:33:31,327
other option is death.

2654
03:33:31,327 --> 03:33:34,391
LIAM: Ask him if he's considered Whitestone?

2655
03:33:34,391 --> 03:33:46,362
ORION: Whitestone? Yeah! Well, I guess there's a
couple of options, really. There's this town

2656
03:33:46,362 --> 03:33:50,958
Whitestone that's pretty great and has a lot of
livestock that this creature can consume.

2657
03:33:50,958 --> 03:33:52,874
MARISHA: Yeah, I don't know about that.

2658
03:33:52,874 --> 03:33:55,310
MATT: Go ahead and make a deception check.

2659
03:33:55,310 --> 03:34:01,416
ORION: That is a 24.

2660
03:34:01,416 --> 03:34:08,089
MATT: "Whitestone. How far is this Whitestone?"

2661
03:34:08,089 --> 03:34:15,226
MARISHA: Wait! No! Hang on! No! This is getting
out of control already. I will not let you all do

2662
03:34:15,226 --> 03:34:21,520
this! No! Not today. You guys have caused enough
problems. We are not going to push this creature

2663
03:34:21,520 --> 03:34:27,888
on other people. I'm trying, all right? I'm
working on it. I don't want to push this problem

2664
03:34:27,888 --> 03:34:34,210
off on a town that's already being held hostage by
vampires. That fucking sucks! That's double

2665
03:34:34,210 --> 03:34:35,568
shitting on them.

2666
03:34:35,568 --> 03:34:41,369
ORION: Well, the other option was, like I was
saying, perhaps you can form an agreement with

2667
03:34:41,369 --> 03:34:48,477
Emon. I'm sure it would pay in livestock rather
well for the protection of you, such a powerful

2668
03:34:48,477 --> 03:34:53,478
druid, over at least a section of the land. In
exchange for free food for your friend.

2669
03:34:53,478 --> 03:35:08,824
MATT: "You, dragon man, are adorably naive of the
ways of men and those that lie and deceive. I have

2670
03:35:08,824 --> 03:35:19,446
"yet to have met any civilized people who have kept
their word when it came to creatures like this."

2671
03:35:19,446 --> 03:35:28,932
LAURA: Can I come forward? All right. What about
Vasselheim? Not in the city, but outside of it.

2672
03:35:28,932 --> 03:35:32,278
There's plentiful forests, tons of giant creatures
it could feed on.

2673
03:35:32,278 --> 03:35:34,648
ORION: That's right! That's true!

2674
03:35:34,648 --> 03:35:36,466
MARISHA: That actually is fairly true.

2675
03:35:36,466 --> 03:35:42,304
LAURA: There's so many monsters out there, they
don't hunt them all because there's too many.

2676
03:35:42,304 --> 03:35:45,899
ORION: That's a wonderful idea, Vex. Yes!

2677
03:35:45,899 --> 03:35:49,027
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

2678
03:35:49,027 --> 03:35:51,358
ORION: I'll aid her, as well.

2679
03:35:51,358 --> 03:35:57,855
MATT: I'll say you've aided one person recently.
This'll just be her check on this. He really

2680
03:35:57,855 --> 03:35:59,574
doesn't trust you, given the current
circumstances.

2681
03:35:59,574 --> 03:36:01,992
LAURA: 21.

2682
03:36:01,992 --> 03:36:03,748
MATT: Natural 20.

2683
03:36:03,748 --> 03:36:17,755
LAURA: Then as a natural 20, you know that's good
for you. That's the best place you can go. You can

2684
03:36:17,755 --> 03:36:20,489
see the wisdom in my persuasion.

2685
03:36:20,489 --> 03:36:24,297
ORION: It is true, though. I mean, it's just feed
walking all around for it.

2686
03:36:24,297 --> 03:36:28,523
MARISHA: Please, please listen to us. We're only
trying to help.

2687
03:36:28,523 --> 03:36:34,987
SAM: Is there a young creature around here besides
the--

2688
03:36:34,987 --> 03:36:37,681
MATT: No, looking about you, no.

2689
03:36:37,681 --> 03:36:40,020
SAM: There's no babies there?

2690
03:36:40,020 --> 03:36:43,291
MATT: No. This is the young. This bird is like the
adolescent.

2691
03:36:43,291 --> 03:36:48,054
MARISHA: Please believe me. I let this thing
almost take my hand off, and I'm still standing

2692
03:36:48,054 --> 03:36:55,339
here fairly cogently talking to you, so please
take that as a sign of honesty.

2693
03:36:55,339 --> 03:37:00,664
LAURA: I go and put my hand on her back and cast
Cure Wounds, because I got that spell now, yo!

2694
03:37:00,664 --> 03:37:05,307
SAM: Where are we telling them to go?

2695
03:37:05,307 --> 03:37:06,701
TRAVIS: To Vasselheim.

2696
03:37:06,701 --> 03:37:07,999
SAM: Vasselheim?

2697
03:37:07,999 --> 03:37:14,942
MARISHA: Listen. She's right. We have friends in
Vasselheim. We can contact the Slayer's Take.

2698
03:37:14,942 --> 03:37:21,327
We're a part of their guild. We can tell them that
you're coming. They'll not bother you. We can tell

2699
03:37:21,327 --> 03:37:25,454
them they are not allowed to take out a contract
on your creature. You will not be harmed.

2700
03:37:25,454 --> 03:37:28,178
LAURA: Don't bring up contracts, Keyleth. Maybe
just don't even bring it up.

2701
03:37:28,178 --> 03:37:33,076
MARISHA: Because they don't have mercenaries out
there. It has to be approved! So it's really

2702
03:37:33,076 --> 03:37:34,155
good.

2703
03:37:34,155 --> 03:37:40,016
MATT: "And what's to stop them from hunting down a
majestic creature as rare as this one?"

2704
03:37:40,016 --> 03:37:42,221
ORION: Us!

2705
03:37:42,221 --> 03:37:43,822
MATT: "You, who live here in Emon?"

2706
03:37:43,822 --> 03:37:46,333
ORION: Yes. No, us who are members of the guild.

2707
03:37:46,333 --> 03:37:50,732
MATT: "So you also are monster slayers, who come
here under the guise to slay this monster?"

2708
03:37:50,732 --> 03:37:54,641
ORION: No! Not here. Other places that we're
forced to do it. But still we're members.

2709
03:37:54,641 --> 03:37:57,204
MATT: "It's too much talk."

2710
03:37:57,204 --> 03:38:01,917
TRAVIS: Can we kill this thing now? You guys are
doing awesome.

2711
03:38:01,917 --> 03:38:10,431
MARISHA: I feel like I've done pretty damn good!
Come on, man!

2712
03:38:10,431 --> 03:38:19,967
SAM: I start speaking in Gnome to him. Listen.
Earlier, you said that this place was perfect. It

2713
03:38:19,967 --> 03:38:24,982
was safe. There were no large predators. Well,
you're looking at six large predators. We'll keep

2714
03:38:24,982 --> 03:38:29,882
hunting you down and hunting your beast down until
you get out of here. This is your one and only

2715
03:38:29,882 --> 03:38:35,255
warning. You must leave, and you must leave now.
We're giving you a good choice, a safe choice. We

2716
03:38:35,255 --> 03:38:41,344
can help you get there and be safe there. But if
you don't listen to us, we'll start killing.

2717
03:38:41,344 --> 03:38:45,433
MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

2718
03:38:45,433 --> 03:38:48,348
MARISHA: How many fucking persuasion rolls does
this asshole need?

2719
03:38:48,348 --> 03:38:51,447
SAM: Persuasion?

2720
03:38:51,447 --> 03:38:58,258
MATT: This is essentially a conversational skill
challenge. So every success and failure leads

2721
03:38:58,258 --> 03:39:00,518
towards where the conversation's going to end.

2722
03:39:00,518 --> 03:39:02,270
SAM: 32.

2723
03:39:02,270 --> 03:39:13,316
MATT: He gives you a look. Very intense, looking
into your very essence-type stare. His little

2724
03:39:13,316 --> 03:39:28,606
beady gnomish eyes meeting yours. (sighs) "If
we're going to make this journey to where you say

2725
03:39:28,606 --> 03:39:31,259
"this Vasselheim is, how far is it?"

2726
03:39:31,259 --> 03:39:33,106
SAM: Several days' journey.

2727
03:39:33,106 --> 03:39:36,093
LAURA: It's just across the water. You could fly
no problem over it.

2728
03:39:36,093 --> 03:39:37,571
MATT: "Across the sea?"

2729
03:39:37,571 --> 03:39:43,115
TRAVIS: It's across the sea.

2730
03:39:43,115 --> 03:39:49,644
SAM: We can draw you a map. We can give you
provisions. We'll even make sure the farmers

2731
03:39:49,644 --> 03:39:58,604
provide you with a few pieces of livestock to chow
down on before the journey. A parting gift to fuel

2732
03:39:58,604 --> 03:40:07,110
up before the big ride. We can give you papers to
hand to the Slayer's Take that will ensure that

2733
03:40:07,110 --> 03:40:09,119
you'll be treated fairly.

2734
03:40:09,119 --> 03:40:14,707
ORION: I'll take out my Scroll of Telescription
and start writing a note.

2735
03:40:14,707 --> 03:40:21,868
MATT: He looks back towards Keyleth, looks back at
Scanlan, looks back at Keyleth, looks up at the

2736
03:40:21,868 --> 03:40:23,052
bird.

2737
03:40:23,052 --> 03:40:28,164
MARISHA: Please. We really don't need another
death on our conscience today.

2738
03:40:28,164 --> 03:40:41,099
MATT: "Then looks like we don't have much of a
choice, do we? If you can assure us enough food to

2739
03:40:41,099 --> 03:40:49,774
"get across on this journey, we'll make our way
towards this Vasselheim. I pray on the solidarity

2740
03:40:49,774 --> 03:40:58,954
"between our kin, and our kin, that you speak the
truth that resonates this moment. Because if it

2741
03:40:58,954 --> 03:41:03,967
"does not, may the fall of this entity and myself
weigh on your conscience."

2742
03:41:03,967 --> 03:41:09,015
ORION: I flip over the note that I'm writing to
him and then I trigger it (flying noise) as he's

2743
03:41:09,015 --> 03:41:10,419
reading it.

2744
03:41:10,419 --> 03:41:24,103
MATT: All right. It (poof) vanishes. "As the sun
rises, two sizable pieces of livestock to be

2745
03:41:24,103 --> 03:41:31,160
"placed at the boundaries of the usual hunting
site. If those are there, and it is taken without

2746
03:41:31,160 --> 03:41:39,004
"any sort of aggression, we'll take that as a sign
that you are being honest, and we shan't bother

2747
03:41:39,004 --> 03:41:41,098
"you or your people any further."

2748
03:41:41,098 --> 03:41:44,939
SAM: I bow deeply and when I do, it goes (cowbell
ringing).

2749
03:41:44,939 --> 03:41:55,426
MATT: For a moment, you think you hear a slight,
uncontrollable chuckle from the gnome.

2750
03:41:55,426 --> 03:42:05,786
ORION: As that's going on, because we're going to
head back right now to seal this up, right? Then

2751
03:42:05,786 --> 03:42:13,292
I'll do my Teleportation Circle. Which is closer
to the northeast: the Lyceum or the Keep?

2752
03:42:13,292 --> 03:42:17,493
MATT: To the north side of it? That would be the
Lyceum.

2753
03:42:17,493 --> 03:42:20,304
LAURA: We could fly back pretty fast. Couldn't
we?

2754
03:42:20,304 --> 03:42:22,295
MATT: If he has another Fly spell, you could take
it right back.

2755
03:42:22,295 --> 03:42:24,002
LAURA: Yeah, we can just fly back.

2756
03:42:24,002 --> 03:42:30,492
MARISHA: Before he leaves. Well, wait! We've got
to go to the farm.

2757
03:42:30,492 --> 03:42:33,953
SAM: We've got to go to the farmers. We've got to
buy some cows off them.

2758
03:42:33,953 --> 03:42:42,857
MARISHA: And I tell him, if you're up that way,
there's a druidic tribe, a little village called

2759
03:42:42,857 --> 03:42:51,542
Pyrah. They're Fire Ashari. You can find their
headmaster Cerkonos. He's a friend. You might find

2760
03:42:51,542 --> 03:42:55,234
your people there. Who knows? Maybe friends will
do you good.

2761
03:42:55,234 --> 03:43:02,734
MATT: "Ashari, you say? My dealings with them have
been mixed. Perhaps I'll keep my distance."

2762
03:43:02,734 --> 03:43:10,288
LAURA: Can I see if there's any feathers dropped
from the giant bird creature?

2763
03:43:10,288 --> 03:43:12,017
MATT: There are ample around.

2764
03:43:12,017 --> 03:43:13,989
LAURA: Can I grab a few of them?

2765
03:43:13,989 --> 03:43:17,526
MATT: As you go and reach up, slaps you across the
knuckles.

2766
03:43:17,526 --> 03:43:20,950
LAURA: Can I have a feather that he dropped?

2767
03:43:20,950 --> 03:43:22,367
MATT: "Why?"

2768
03:43:22,367 --> 03:43:27,637
LAURA: Because they're beautiful. You have to
admit they're beautiful.

2769
03:43:27,637 --> 03:43:33,965
MATT: (sighs) "Elves. All right."

2770
03:43:33,965 --> 03:43:35,601
LAURA: Thank you.

2771
03:43:35,601 --> 03:43:39,841
MATT: You take three roc feathers.

2772
03:43:39,841 --> 03:43:42,432
TRAVIS: They're huge, right?

2773
03:43:42,432 --> 03:43:45,554
MATT: Yeah. They're almost boat size.

2774
03:43:45,554 --> 03:43:48,064
ORION: I put one in my Bag of Holding, too.

2775
03:43:48,064 --> 03:43:57,260
MATT: You guys manage to get one for you and three
for you guys before he's like, "Now go! Now! My

2776
03:43:57,260 --> 03:44:03,622
"patience wears thin. I'm through with talking
words." (sighs)

2777
03:44:03,622 --> 03:44:05,220
SAM: Sorry.

2778
03:44:05,220 --> 03:44:07,922
LIAM: I walk out from behind him and just walk past.

2779
03:44:07,922 --> 03:44:09,801
MATT: (yelps)

2780
03:44:09,801 --> 03:44:12,151
SAM: (laughs) Sorry about that.

2781
03:44:12,151 --> 03:44:15,759
ORION: All right. I'll burn another 5th-level and
then fly us all out.

2782
03:44:15,759 --> 03:44:28,593
MATT: Okay. You guys coast back to the north side
of Emon. You go to the door where the Klaus family

2783
03:44:28,593 --> 03:44:35,387
is, and you speak with them for a while. You
manage to convince them of the situation and what

2784
03:44:35,387 --> 03:44:40,120
seems to be a mutually positive circumstance. They
agree it's better to lose two cows than continue

2785
03:44:40,120 --> 03:44:41,205
this.

2786
03:44:41,205 --> 03:44:43,593
LAURA: I pay them for their two cows. Being nice,
man!

2787
03:44:43,593 --> 03:44:45,167
MATT: How much do you give them?

2788
03:44:45,167 --> 03:44:48,839
LAURA: How much are cows usually worth?

2789
03:44:48,839 --> 03:44:50,636
MATT: You've never purchased a cow, so you don't
know.

2790
03:44:50,636 --> 03:44:53,056
LAURA: Yes I have! I purchased Dork the ox.

2791
03:44:53,056 --> 03:44:54,738
MATT: An ox is not a cow.

2792
03:44:54,738 --> 03:44:58,607
LAURA: Shit! How much do your cows normally cost,
darling?

2793
03:44:58,607 --> 03:45:05,913
MATT: This is a good question. Let me look in the book.
I've not had to look up the cost of a cow before.

2794
03:45:05,913 --> 03:45:26,572
I would put it at about maybe 40 gold each.

2795
03:45:26,572 --> 03:45:29,083
LAURA: That's way more than I expected.

2796
03:45:29,083 --> 03:45:33,606
MATT: Because they can be used for meat, they can
be used for milk.

2797
03:45:33,606 --> 03:45:41,019
LAURA: 40 gold each to make up for the loss of
your cows.

2798
03:45:41,019 --> 03:45:45,048
MATT: "Thank you so much. I greatly appreciate you
helping with this. And you promise, this will--"

2799
03:45:45,048 --> 03:45:48,183
SAM: Yes, just put them out in the open field.

2800
03:45:48,183 --> 03:45:49,225
TRAVIS: We'll take them.

2801
03:45:49,225 --> 03:45:50,392
SAM: Oh, we'll take them?

2802
03:45:50,392 --> 03:45:52,245
TRAVIS: We'll put them out there. Stake them.

2803
03:45:52,245 --> 03:45:53,711
SAM: Okay, we'll take care of it.

2804
03:45:53,711 --> 03:45:57,883
MATT: You guys take two of the cows. You bring
them to the outskirts. With rope tied around their

2805
03:45:57,883 --> 03:46:05,281
neck, you essentially hitching-post them to the
outside of this open area, about 20 to 30 feet

2806
03:46:05,281 --> 03:46:12,182
from the actual holding pen. A few hours go by,
and the sun slowly begins to rise.

2807
03:46:12,182 --> 03:46:14,660
LAURA: Along with some other food, right?

2808
03:46:14,660 --> 03:46:20,630
MATT: Place some of their feed and things around
there. Eventually, the sun begins to rise across

2809
03:46:20,630 --> 03:46:27,182
the eastern sky. As it crests, you can see some of
the farmers come out, anxiously watching from

2810
03:46:27,182 --> 03:46:35,879
their homes. You see different families gathering.
The wings beating in the air, and it swoops down

2811
03:46:35,879 --> 03:46:40,866
(swoosh) and grabs two of them. You can see some
of the families gasp and rush inside, and some are

2812
03:46:40,866 --> 03:46:47,700
amazed to see this even happen. It takes the two,
carries them up, and heads out over the Ozmit Sea,

2813
03:46:47,700 --> 03:46:53,805
passing to the northwest side, and over the next
30 or so minutes, slowly disappears over the

2814
03:46:53,805 --> 03:46:55,950
horizon until it's no longer visible.

2815
03:46:55,950 --> 03:46:59,388
TRAVIS: The sun rose, right? Can I make a beard
check?

2816
03:46:59,388 --> 03:47:01,207
(laughter)

2817
03:47:01,207 --> 03:47:02,766
MATT: You may.

2818
03:47:02,766 --> 03:47:04,707
TRAVIS: Two, zero.

2819
03:47:04,707 --> 03:47:08,978
MATT: With that, (creak) the beginnings of the
other side of your beard slowly begins to set in.

2820
03:47:08,978 --> 03:47:10,922
TRAVIS: What happens to the existing side?

2821
03:47:10,922 --> 03:47:15,762
MATT: The existing side has rounded itself off to
a nice beard. It's pretty much where it's going to

2822
03:47:15,762 --> 03:47:22,712
be on that side. The other side is now starting to
finally catch up. And that's where we'll end: on a

2823
03:47:22,712 --> 03:47:25,089
successful beard check.

2824
03:47:25,089 --> 03:47:30,433
SAM: Wow. That was a crazy night.

2825
03:47:30,433 --> 03:47:37,151
TRAVIS: Perspiration was happening.

2826
03:47:37,151 --> 03:47:38,886
MARISHA: Yeah, it was.

2827
03:47:38,886 --> 03:47:40,791
SAM: I gave you my hand.

2828
03:47:40,791 --> 03:47:44,691
MATT: More battle maps that will never get used.

2829
03:47:44,691 --> 03:47:49,233
LAURA: Look at us not fighting things. That's
really beautiful.

2830
03:47:49,233 --> 03:47:52,164
MATT: That would have been really bad, too.

2831
03:47:52,164 --> 03:47:54,484
LAURA: I'm glad we didn't fight it.

2832
03:47:54,484 --> 03:47:56,064
TRAVIS: Bad for us?

2833
03:47:56,064 --> 03:47:58,917
MATT: Well, just imagine a giant bird that grabs
you and then drops you off the side of a mountain.

2834
03:47:58,917 --> 03:48:10,223
Would have been an interesting fight. Cool. That
concludes a unique Percy-less bottle episode of

2835
03:48:10,223 --> 03:48:11,397
Critical Role.

2836
03:48:11,397 --> 03:48:13,267
TRAVIS: Squadron of cows.

2837
03:48:13,267 --> 03:48:18,719
MATT: Squadron of flying midnight cows. That is
probably the weirdest thing that's ever-- no,

2838
03:48:18,719 --> 03:48:22,931
there's been weirder. That's in the top five of
weird things that's happened in DND for me.

2839
03:48:22,931 --> 03:48:24,598
SAM: Fighting "formootion."

2840
03:48:24,598 --> 03:48:27,735
(groaning)

2841
03:48:27,735 --> 04:41:17,460
