00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,255
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to this
evening's Critical Role, an online game of D&amp;D

2
00:00:06,255 --> 00:00:10,940
where a bunch of us voice actors get together to
be super nerdy and roll dice. And Sam just got

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:17,403
here! And so we're going to send someone to go get
Sam. Is someone getting Sam? All right! Great, Sam

4
00:00:17,403 --> 00:00:23,419
will be here shortly. Anyway, welcome! So, first
and foremost, let's go ahead and get to our

5
00:00:23,419 --> 00:00:27,310
announcements so we can get to the game, because
tonight is Critmas, which means we're going to be

6
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:32,823
opening a bunch of amazing presents, letters, and
stuff that you guys send to us. That'll be coming

7
00:00:32,823 --> 00:00:36,976
up soon. So first and foremost, wanted to let you
guys know, if you haven't seen on Twitter yet,

8
00:00:36,976 --> 00:00:43,303
that the majority of our little merry band of
players here are going to be appearing at Wizard

9
00:00:43,303 --> 00:00:47,312
World Portland in February. February 19th through
the 21st.

10
00:00:47,312 --> 00:00:50,324
LAURA: Everybody except for some people.

11
00:00:50,324 --> 00:00:51,725
MATT: I know.

12
00:00:51,725 --> 00:00:53,825
LIAM: I could skip my daughter's birthday.

13
00:00:53,825 --> 00:00:56,052
MARISHA: She'll have another one.

14
00:00:56,052 --> 00:00:58,794
LIAM: She's at the point where she'll kind of
remember.

15
00:00:58,794 --> 00:01:00,018
LAURA: Sam!

16
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:07,621
MATT: It's fine. No, sit right there, it's good.
But yeah, February 19th through the 21st, we'll be

17
00:01:07,621 --> 00:01:12,294
there doing panels and signings and all kinds of
fun stuff. So if you're in the Portland area or

18
00:01:12,294 --> 00:01:16,066
want to come out to the Portland area, we'll be
there then. Come say hello. Don't waste your

19
00:01:16,066 --> 00:01:17,797
twenties, Laura. You know this!

20
00:01:17,797 --> 00:01:19,065
TRAVIS: She doesn't know this.

21
00:01:19,065 --> 00:01:24,438
MATT: I know. She'll never learn. I do like that
you and Ashley coordinated, though, from across

22
00:01:24,438 --> 00:01:25,228
the country.

23
00:01:25,228 --> 00:01:26,253
LAURA: I know, right!?

24
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:27,200
MATT: That's awesome.

25
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,267
LAURA: We're twinkies!

26
00:01:28,267 --> 00:01:29,522
ASHLEY: We're twinkies!

27
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:38,117
MATT: But yeah, so guys. Go ahead and tweet at
Wizard World and let them know how excited you are

28
00:01:38,117 --> 00:01:41,924
that we're going to Portland, because even if
you're not able to go to this convention, the more

29
00:01:41,924 --> 00:01:47,674
that they see the audience has a need for more
Critical Role at their conventions, they might

30
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:53,449
bring us to other parts of the country. This is
our trial run with their venues. So tell them how

31
00:01:53,449 --> 00:01:59,831
excited you are, and that'd be awesome. Cool. Next
up, another convention coming up. Me and Marisha

32
00:01:59,831 --> 00:02:06,481
actually will be guests, weekend before that, at
the Colorado Animefest in Denver, Colorado.

33
00:02:06,481 --> 00:02:07,798
MARISHA: Dick.

34
00:02:07,798 --> 00:02:09,368
MATT: What did I do?

35
00:02:09,368 --> 00:02:10,470
MARISHA: Not you.

36
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,207
SAM: I'm a dick. I'm always a dick.

37
00:02:13,207 --> 00:02:16,544
MATT: You are a dick. It's good. It's a good place
to be. But that's February 12th through the 14th in

38
00:02:16,544 --> 00:02:17,797
Denver.

39
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:19,211
MARISHA: Yes. Valentine's Day weekend.

40
00:02:19,211 --> 00:02:21,457
MATT: Yep. We're going to Casa Bonita. We're doing
this South Park-style.

41
00:02:21,457 --> 00:02:22,613
MARISHA: I'm so excited.

42
00:02:22,613 --> 00:02:23,835
TALIESIN: Have you never been to Casa Bonita?

43
00:02:23,835 --> 00:02:25,193
MARISHA: No! I'm so excited.

44
00:02:25,193 --> 00:02:27,604
TALIESIN: I would say you're in for a treat, but
it's so much more than that.

45
00:02:27,604 --> 00:02:30,444
MARISHA: Oh man. Cliff divers.

46
00:02:30,444 --> 00:02:35,585
MATT: It's going to be great. So, Colorado
Animefest, February 12th through the 14th. Come

47
00:02:35,585 --> 00:02:43,736
say hello, we'd love to see you. Let's see. Liam,
did you want to take the shout-out to The Witness?

48
00:02:43,736 --> 00:02:49,707
LIAM: Yeah! There is a very interesting game
coming out called The Witness at the end of this

49
00:02:49,707 --> 00:02:55,176
month. If any of you played Braid, which was an
amazing platformer, but so much more than a

50
00:02:55,176 --> 00:03:00,565
platformer, it fucked with your head. That game
was made by Jonathan Blow. Jonathan Blow is making

51
00:03:00,565 --> 00:03:05,593
another game called The Witness. I'm not going to
tell you anything about it, but I'm voice

52
00:03:05,593 --> 00:03:11,325
directing, or I voice directed on it. This one,
Ashley is in the game, and it was one of the most

53
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:18,282
unique recording gigs I've ever had. I don't
really know what I should say, but I think you

54
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:19,634
guys are going to want to check it out.

55
00:03:19,634 --> 00:03:20,938
LAURA: I think you've said enough.

56
00:03:20,938 --> 00:03:22,540
(laughter)

57
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,782
ASHLEY: Said enough!

58
00:03:23,782 --> 00:03:25,312
MATT: Boom. Done.

59
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,900
LIAM: Wyrmwood Gaming, everyone!

60
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,774
TRAVIS: Wyrmwood!

61
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:33,239
LIAM: Wyrmwood Gaming, if you use the code
"critrole," you'll get free shipping! Free

62
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:34,278
shipping.

63
00:03:34,278 --> 00:03:35,319
MARISHA: So stylish.

64
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:36,929
MATT: Mine says 'storyteller'.

65
00:03:36,929 --> 00:03:38,412
SAM: Wyrmwood Gaming?

66
00:03:38,412 --> 00:03:41,422
ASHLEY: Completely obsessed with it.

67
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:43,812
SAM: That's not mine.

68
00:03:43,812 --> 00:03:45,454
TALIESIN: That's not mine.

69
00:03:45,454 --> 00:03:48,636
TRAVIS: Oh, that's mine!

70
00:03:48,636 --> 00:03:50,165
MARISHA: That's Travis's!

71
00:03:50,165 --> 00:03:51,324
SAM: Ready?

72
00:03:51,324 --> 00:03:52,326
TRAVIS: Yep.

73
00:03:52,326 --> 00:04:02,036
SAM: Pretend like you're a Dallas Cowboy and drop
it. Is this yours? Is this yours?

74
00:04:02,036 --> 00:04:03,633
TRAVIS: No, you can keep that shit.

75
00:04:03,633 --> 00:04:05,601
(laughter)

76
00:04:05,601 --> 00:04:07,889
LIAM: First episode ever, Grog goes after
Scanlan.

77
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:14,843
MATT: It was bound to happen. Also, I wanted to let
you guys know, it's awesome, we got to donate

78
00:04:14,843 --> 00:04:21,170
five thousand dollars to 826LA at the end of last
year because of you guys being so amazing. So once

79
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:25,386
again, wanted to say thank you guys for that. That
was fantastic and you're awesome.

80
00:04:25,386 --> 00:04:30,042
MARISHA: And we're still supporting 826LA, so you
can still donate.

81
00:04:30,042 --> 00:04:30,925
MATT: Yes!

82
00:04:30,925 --> 00:04:32,496
MARISHA: It's still there, you can still do it.

83
00:04:32,496 --> 00:04:33,989
SAM and MARISHA: It's still there.

84
00:04:33,989 --> 00:04:37,760
TRAVIS: They still be helping kids read and write
and play D&amp;D. It's amazing.

85
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:42,148
MATT: It's great. so look and see if there's an
826 in your area and see what you can do to help,

86
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:49,881
participate, even become a tutor. It's awesome.
It's great work. So you may have seen this week,

87
00:04:49,881 --> 00:04:55,476
Wizards of the Coast launched a new service called
the Dungeon Masters Guild, which is one of the

88
00:04:55,476 --> 00:04:59,983
coolest things they've done in a long time.
They've opened up D&amp;D 5th Edition to an open

89
00:04:59,983 --> 00:05:04,482
gaming license. You can now create your own
content within the 5th edition system and release

90
00:05:04,482 --> 00:05:10,376
it on their website and put it up for purchase,
and people can purchase your content. It's a

91
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:15,059
wonderful homebrew community that they've
developed that I think really elevates all

92
00:05:15,059 --> 00:05:20,617
of us players and DMs and people that want to
contribute to the community. So check it out. It's

93
00:05:20,617 --> 00:05:25,644
awesome. I'm super excited about it and I've seen
so many great homebrew stuff already go up there.

94
00:05:25,644 --> 00:05:28,694
They've also opened up Forgotten Realms to people
who want to create stuff within the Forgotten

95
00:05:28,694 --> 00:05:29,664
Realms.

96
00:05:29,664 --> 00:05:32,191
TALIESIN: You should totally put some stuff up
there.

97
00:05:32,191 --> 00:05:33,033
MATT: I should.

98
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:33,899
TALIESIN: You really should.

99
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:39,290
MATT: I really should. Actually, I'm blown away. I
put up the updated blood hunter and the updated

100
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:45,114
gunslinger. I got a full PDF made in the same
quality with wonderful art from Joma and Nick

101
00:05:45,114 --> 00:05:50,253
Robles. Really excited about it, and you guys
should check it out. It's a really good service.

102
00:05:50,253 --> 00:05:57,290
So good on you. So, any other announcements you'd
like to make tonight? Anyone? Or are we about to

103
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,406
start this?

104
00:05:58,406 --> 00:06:00,693
TRAVIS: Let's get it on.

105
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:13,967
MATT: All righty. So, to get you guys up to speed
with what's happened recently: the party, upon

106
00:06:13,967 --> 00:06:18,768
returning from their adventure in Whitestone, had
a meeting with the council of Tal'Dorei where they

107
00:06:18,768 --> 00:06:25,661
were able to provide information, a witness, and
have the guidance of the now no-longer-charmed

108
00:06:25,661 --> 00:06:33,662
sovereign, Uriel Tal'Dorei, to alleviate them of
any wrongdoing in the Briarwoods' arrival in Emon

109
00:06:33,662 --> 00:06:39,388
months ago, and reinstated their membership in the
council, dropped the charges that were

110
00:06:39,388 --> 00:06:46,494
against them from the city of Emon and the party
basically have now become once again lauded and

111
00:06:46,494 --> 00:06:53,162
accepted within the city. At the same time, Uriel,
going through a bit of an emotional breakdown with

112
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:58,648
his lack of seeming leadership in this whole
circumstance. It was discovered that the reason

113
00:06:58,648 --> 00:07:03,504
his defences were improper was because there was
an individual on the actual council who was a

114
00:07:03,504 --> 00:07:08,212
traitor, who'd been working with the Briarwoods
and secretly a follower of Vecna from what the

115
00:07:08,212 --> 00:07:15,415
documents seemed to say. However, he had fled and
the party decided to go ahead and probably do a

116
00:07:15,415 --> 00:07:20,169
little better job than the local guard would, find
out if he was too far or not. They found that

117
00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:25,255
he was still in the city, beneath the city, and
happened to correlate his current location with

118
00:07:25,255 --> 00:07:30,274
the Clasp, the thieves' guild of the city's
current underground base which the party had

119
00:07:30,274 --> 00:07:36,548
previously had a few run-ins before. So making
their way to the inn that houses one of the secret

120
00:07:36,548 --> 00:07:44,195
entrances to the Clasp's hideout, they encountered
a band of traveling musicians. Doctor Dranzel's

121
00:07:44,195 --> 00:07:52,647
wondrous performance group made their way-- the
magical? I'm trying to remember what the actual

122
00:07:52,647 --> 00:07:54,670
full term was on that one that you wrote for it.

123
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:59,219
SAM: Oh, their troupe? The troupe name? Oh man, I
wrote that three years ago. I have no idea.

124
00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:04,939
MATT: I know. I wrote it down in a document that I
didn't print out. But I will for future shows. So

125
00:08:04,939 --> 00:08:05,956
Dr. Dranzel--

126
00:08:05,956 --> 00:08:07,143
SAM: We'll look it up on the break.

127
00:08:07,143 --> 00:08:10,330
MATT: Yeah, there you go. It had a great
performance troupe.

128
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:11,818
SAM: Magical Mystery Band.

129
00:08:11,818 --> 00:08:18,823
MATT: Yeah, that's the one. And discovered a
number of past individuals of Scanlan's

130
00:08:18,823 --> 00:08:28,962
performance history as well as a few new friends
and got into an epic flute duel of which he threw

131
00:08:28,962 --> 00:08:36,779
and in doing so, being a man of his word, gave the
remaining gold coins in his pouch to a young

132
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:37,560
gnome.

133
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,662
LAURA: Just the worst.

134
00:08:38,662 --> 00:08:39,711
SAM: It was worth it.

135
00:08:39,711 --> 00:08:40,502
LAURA: Was it?

136
00:08:40,502 --> 00:08:42,013
SAM: Well, we'll find out.

137
00:08:42,013 --> 00:08:44,057
TALIESIN: It's like a Tom Waits song.

138
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:49,133
MATT: Yeah, with the distraction being successful
the rest of the party snuck through the kitchen

139
00:08:49,133 --> 00:08:54,353
into the hatch and they had an encounter with the
Clasp after calling out to them within their own

140
00:08:54,353 --> 00:08:58,860
hideout. Telling them that they were after this
fugitive and not planning to do any terrible

141
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,485
business in the guild and managed to convince them
to let them go about their way and Vox Machina had

142
00:09:02,485 --> 00:09:10,007
a showdown with the traitor, Riskel Daxio, within
his cell, before he was supposed to be ushered out

143
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:14,691
of the city, given a new name, and essentially be
given free rein in the world. The party then beat

144
00:09:14,691 --> 00:09:22,216
him down pretty hard and are currently dragging
his bleeding, unconscious corpse towards the

145
00:09:22,216 --> 00:09:24,243
Cloudtop District to turn him in.

146
00:09:24,243 --> 00:09:26,170
SAM: Right. That's right. He's not dead.

147
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:29,825
TALIESIN: It's an unconscious corpse. Which means
it's technically--

148
00:09:29,825 --> 00:09:31,598
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Not a corpse.

149
00:09:31,598 --> 00:09:33,419
MATT: This is true. I don't know why I said
corpse.

150
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:34,792
TRAVIS: Foreshadowing!

151
00:09:34,792 --> 00:09:37,256
LAURA: Oh, no. What are we going to do?

152
00:09:37,256 --> 00:09:40,167
MATT: A near corpse. He is borderline corpse.

153
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:47,815
LAURA: Mostly dead. Not all dead.

154
00:09:47,815 --> 00:09:54,820
MATT: So, as you guys make your way towards the
center of Emon, the central wall that surrounds

155
00:09:54,820 --> 00:10:00,463
the Cloudtop District comes into view and the
front gates that face the southwestern side of the

156
00:10:00,463 --> 00:10:05,212
city reveal themselves down the thoroughfare.
There you see the four guards that are posted at

157
00:10:05,212 --> 00:10:09,449
that entrance notice you approaching and
immediately two of them begin to come up to you.

158
00:10:09,449 --> 00:10:14,458
And you've interacted with these individuals a few
times as your experiences here in the city so far

159
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:19,365
and they've grown to recognize you just by
appearance and you guys tend to stroll up as a

160
00:10:19,365 --> 00:10:22,762
posse of confidence, which draws their attention.

161
00:10:22,762 --> 00:10:24,705
MARISHA: Fucking with my clique.

162
00:10:24,705 --> 00:10:25,998
MATT: Exactly.

163
00:10:25,998 --> 00:10:27,683
TALIESIN: We're Reservoir Dogging it.

164
00:10:27,683 --> 00:10:28,811
LAURA: 'Sup.

165
00:10:28,811 --> 00:10:30,121
TALIESIN: Walking really slow.

166
00:10:30,121 --> 00:10:38,074
MATT: At this point the sun is setting, it's
probably getting close to dusk. You guys stroll up

167
00:10:38,074 --> 00:10:43,448
and the two guards approach immediately. "Can I
ask you what you're doing here? You've got

168
00:10:43,448 --> 00:10:44,298
"someone--"

169
00:10:44,298 --> 00:10:47,256
LAURA: We have a present for Uriel. Open the
gates.

170
00:10:47,256 --> 00:10:50,368
MATT: "Well, what's the present?"

171
00:10:50,368 --> 00:10:54,069
LAURA: Are you questioning part of the council at
this moment?

172
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:58,558
MATT: "No, if there is business to be done I have
to go ahead and put it up the chain of command to

173
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:00,971
"make sure that I'm doing my job so I don't end up
being lashed for my--"

174
00:11:00,971 --> 00:11:03,190
LAURA: Of course, darling, and you're doing a
wonderful job of it.

175
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:07,273
MATT: "Well, I appreciate that and I'd appreciate
you helping me do my job, if that's all right."

176
00:11:07,273 --> 00:11:12,382
LAURA: We have a present for Uriel. Open the
gates. Send it up the chain of command.

177
00:11:12,382 --> 00:11:19,313
MATT: Turns around and walks back, the other guy
looks back awkwardly and follows him. He gives a

178
00:11:19,313 --> 00:11:23,449
couple hand motions and the gates open up to the
inside of the Cloudtop District.

179
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,488
TRAVIS: He's on the back of the bear, right?

180
00:11:25,488 --> 00:11:27,090
SAM: The bear we left at home.

181
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:29,080
TALIESIN: The bear we left in the alley.

182
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,924
LAURA: He is with us. What?

183
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:35,050
SAM: Next time. Next time.

184
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,953
TALIESIN: The bear is a necessity.

185
00:11:36,953 --> 00:11:38,882
(groaning)

186
00:11:38,882 --> 00:11:43,493
TRAVIS: We take him inside.

187
00:11:43,493 --> 00:11:44,788
LAURA: Wait a minute!

188
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:45,597
TRAVIS and SAM: What?

189
00:11:45,597 --> 00:11:49,181
LAURA: Where's Trinket right now?! Why isn't he on
the set?!

190
00:11:49,181 --> 00:11:50,619
SAM: Where is Trinket?

191
00:11:50,619 --> 00:11:51,945
MARISHA: He's in the alley.

192
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:52,979
LAURA: I'm getting him right now.

193
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:54,999
TRAVIS: No, no, no, no. Come on.

194
00:11:54,999 --> 00:11:56,904
LAURA: I know where he is.

195
00:11:56,904 --> 00:11:59,355
LIAM: Look Sam, what did you do?

196
00:11:59,355 --> 00:12:07,616
SAM: This is just like when David Copperfield made the
Statue of Liberty disappear.

197
00:12:07,616 --> 00:12:10,508
MATT: It's just like it. Exactly.

198
00:12:10,508 --> 00:12:14,884
SAM: Yep. David Copperfield? Feld?

199
00:12:14,884 --> 00:12:18,903
MARISHA: It's amazing because you can like hear
her footsteps. It's like a cartoon.

200
00:12:18,903 --> 00:12:24,329
TALIESIN: It's like an ad for Atmos Surround, you
hear (ticking noises).

201
00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:27,081
MARISHA: It's totally like a Pixar intro.

202
00:12:27,081 --> 00:12:29,436
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

203
00:12:29,436 --> 00:12:32,879
MATT: I'm excited for the prospect of watching
this happen right now.

204
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:35,433
TALIESIN: Nothing can go wrong. This is a great
idea.

205
00:12:35,433 --> 00:12:36,841
MARISHA: No one help her.

206
00:12:36,841 --> 00:12:38,738
LIAM: No one help her.

207
00:12:38,738 --> 00:12:40,190
TALIESIN: She can do this.

208
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,952
MATT: You got this, Laura. You got this.

209
00:12:42,952 --> 00:12:44,918
ASHLEY: You got it. You got it.

210
00:12:44,918 --> 00:12:48,863
LAURA: Help me. Can you see this?

211
00:12:48,863 --> 00:12:50,763
TRAVIS: Nope.

212
00:12:50,763 --> 00:12:53,589
LAURA: Travis, move your butt! I've got to get
Trinket through!

213
00:12:53,589 --> 00:12:55,770
SAM: Travis can move, he's not going to help you.

214
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:56,948
LAURA: Please, Travis.

215
00:12:56,948 --> 00:12:58,720
TRAVIS: All right, I'll move. I'll move.

216
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:04,893
MATT: This is a wonderful microcosm analogy for
pretty much every session.

217
00:13:04,893 --> 00:13:08,498
LAURA: Oh, he's here!

218
00:13:08,498 --> 00:13:12,277
MATT: Yay! Well done.

219
00:13:12,277 --> 00:13:17,482
LAURA: Totally worth it. Is he good? Is he placed
well, you guys?

220
00:13:17,482 --> 00:13:18,651
TRAVIS: Sure.

221
00:13:18,651 --> 00:13:20,798
SAM: That's a good core body workout.

222
00:13:20,798 --> 00:13:22,323
LAURA: Oh my gosh, I'm so strong.

223
00:13:22,323 --> 00:13:24,172
MARISHA: This was the best opening of our show.

224
00:13:24,172 --> 00:13:25,606
MATT: What's your strength?

225
00:13:25,606 --> 00:13:27,025
LAURA: Very low.

226
00:13:27,025 --> 00:13:32,001
MARISHA: We should've played our theme music over
that.

227
00:13:32,001 --> 00:13:34,514
(laughter)

228
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:40,686
MATT: So, pushing towards the central palace, the
guards approach once again. These ones a little

229
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:45,006
more stern than the ones you met on the outside of
the district. "What's your business at the palace?"

230
00:13:45,006 --> 00:13:46,514
SAM: Again?

231
00:13:46,514 --> 00:13:52,086
LAURA: We, look, we have a body over this bear!
Let us through to Uriel; he's been looking for

232
00:13:52,086 --> 00:13:55,380
this man. Super important.

233
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,448
MATT: The guards look over at the bear.

234
00:13:57,448 --> 00:13:59,620
SAM: They know this man. They should know this
man.

235
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,656
MATT: "You found Riskel Daxio?"

236
00:14:01,656 --> 00:14:03,415
LAURA: Of course we did!

237
00:14:03,415 --> 00:14:05,075
MATT: "All right, men!"

238
00:14:05,075 --> 00:14:07,326
MARISHA: But don't tell him! It's a surprise.
It's a present.

239
00:14:07,326 --> 00:14:09,706
MATT: The other guards begin to step forward like,
"We'll take it from here."

240
00:14:09,706 --> 00:14:11,208
LAURA: No no no. No, you won't.

241
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,732
TRAVIS: The fuck you will.

242
00:14:12,732 --> 00:14:18,353
TALIESIN: We would like to deliver this personally
as we don't know if he has any co-conspirators, so

243
00:14:18,353 --> 00:14:21,285
it would be best if he didn't leave our immediate
vicinity.

244
00:14:21,285 --> 00:14:26,402
MARISHA: And we really want to see his face when
he opens it. That's the best part of giving a gift.

245
00:14:26,402 --> 00:14:32,177
MATT: The guard raises his hand and the guards
stop. "Very well. Proceed inward." Steps aside,

246
00:14:32,177 --> 00:14:36,123
the guards separate and you can see they're all
looking a little nervous that they basically had

247
00:14:36,123 --> 00:14:41,701
their job done for them. It's not going to do well
down the chain of command in the very near future.

248
00:14:41,701 --> 00:14:50,262
You guys step into the palace, make your way to
the main hallway that leads to the central throne

249
00:14:50,262 --> 00:14:54,974
chambers. Uriel is not there at the moment. The
guards ask you to wait. You wait about five to

250
00:14:54,983 --> 00:14:59,340
ten minutes or so before the doors open again and
Uriel is hastily walking in, sitting down on his

251
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:08,303
throne. The rest of the council isn't present for
this. It's just him currently, and I believe Tofor

252
00:15:08,303 --> 00:15:15,150
Brotorus, the female dragonborn on the council,
with you guys.

253
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:24,052
So, as you approach, Uriel sits down, his robes
swishing about him. "All right, it hasn't been too

254
00:15:24,052 --> 00:15:28,003
"long. You requested my presence. And I am here.
What do you need?"

255
00:15:28,003 --> 00:15:30,811
TALIESIN: Vex, this is all yours.

256
00:15:30,811 --> 00:15:35,944
LAURA: Oh, well, not all me. This is all of us. We
found your traitor for you.

257
00:15:35,944 --> 00:15:40,133
MATT: "Really?" And he stands up and the rest of
the guards that came up behind you keep an eye to

258
00:15:40,133 --> 00:15:45,430
make sure nothing weird goes wrong, they step
forward a few steps and, "Bring him forth. Hold

259
00:15:45,534 --> 00:15:51,734
"him. In irons. Chains. Now." And all the guards go
and pull him off of Trinket, throw him on the

260
00:15:51,734 --> 00:15:55,482
ground face-first. He slaps into the marble
flooring of the chamber.

261
00:15:55,482 --> 00:15:56,548
TRAVIS: Yeah.

262
00:15:56,548 --> 00:15:58,750
MATT: Little bit of blood smeared across the ground
as his face glides--

263
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:02,442
LAURA: Yeah, he's beat up pretty bad, you might
not want to--

264
00:16:02,442 --> 00:16:10,788
MATT: "He'll survive." And you can see now there's
a look of pained anger in Uriel's eyes at seeing

265
00:16:10,788 --> 00:16:16,247
the face of someone he trusted for so long. The
guards take the manacles that you guys already had

266
00:16:16,247 --> 00:16:20,649
on him and chain his legs together. They put
another set of manacles across the back of his

267
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:25,544
arms so his arms are actually held in two
places to the back. They lift him onto his knees

268
00:16:25,544 --> 00:16:30,785
and drag him up to the very bottom stair that
leads up to the central dais where the thrones are

269
00:16:30,785 --> 00:16:40,210
on. And he's unconscious, head lolling about.
Uriel looks down and, "Wake him up."

270
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:41,539
SAM: Us?

271
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:43,082
MATT: "Someone. I don't care. Wake him up."

272
00:16:43,082 --> 00:16:45,314
TRAVIS: I got it! I walk over and I slap the shit
out of him.

273
00:16:45,314 --> 00:16:48,265
SAM: You may kill him.

274
00:16:48,265 --> 00:16:49,960
LIAM: Oh, he's dead.

275
00:16:49,960 --> 00:17:01,520
MATT: With a resounding slap sound, Riskel sends a
spatter of spittle and blood that coasts across

276
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:08,639
the floor and his head shakes. As he looks up at
you, you can see his teeth that were once

277
00:17:08,639 --> 00:17:13,094
white now glisten with fresh blood across the
entirety of his smile.

278
00:17:13,094 --> 00:17:14,717
TRAVIS: Hello, gorgeous.

279
00:17:14,717 --> 00:17:27,277
MATT: "Do what you will." He looks up and sees
Uriel. "My liege, what would you have of me?"

280
00:17:27,277 --> 00:17:38,572
Uriel takes a moment, intensely staring at his
face. "For so many years you played me and my

281
00:17:38,572 --> 00:17:46,145
"family. You played the people of this city, of
these lands. You've forsaken the name of your father

282
00:17:46,145 --> 00:17:56,471
"who plucked you from nothing. How? How can you
live with this?" Riskel takes a moment, chuckles

283
00:17:56,471 --> 00:18:01,381
to himself, this throaty gurgle as he's still
trying to breathe through the blood pooling in the

284
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:17,347
back of his throat. "Life is but a stage of our
existence. And when you all will die, I will rise

285
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:20,690
"again. For I am his blood."

286
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,426
SAM: You are his blood?

287
00:18:22,426 --> 00:18:34,280
MATT: Uriel steps back up on his throne and sits
down. "Riskel Daxio, you have been found guilty of

288
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:43,005
"treason by the peoples of Tal'Dorei. I command
that your sentence of death be held immediately."

289
00:18:43,005 --> 00:18:44,581
TRAVIS: Yes!

290
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:53,338
SAM: Sovereign, if I may, can we ask him a few
questions before you do what you gonna do?

291
00:18:53,338 --> 00:18:57,797
MATT: "Quickly."

292
00:18:57,797 --> 00:19:00,207
SAM: He's talking crazy, we should find out why,
right?

293
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:01,703
TRAVIS: Who's talking crazy?

294
00:19:01,703 --> 00:19:04,221
SAM: He said, "I am born of his blood." What
blood?

295
00:19:04,221 --> 00:19:08,447
LAURA: Are you one of Vecna's children? Are you
one of his priests? Are you one of his--

296
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:10,525
LIAM: You're the chatty Cathy. Get with the
talking.

297
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:12,026
SAM: I don't know what I'm asking.

298
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,396
TRAVIS: You never do.

299
00:19:13,396 --> 00:19:23,949
MATT: As you ask him that, "There are many parts
to our one to him. I'm but his blood, but there

300
00:19:23,949 --> 00:19:27,878
"are many, many, different pieces that make the
whole."

301
00:19:27,878 --> 00:19:31,295
SAM: Where are these pieces located?

302
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:34,140
LAURA: Everywhere. Good answer.

303
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:39,833
MARISHA: So when you say you are his blood you
actually mean more literally for once? Is

304
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,820
that what I'm getting?

305
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,127
SAM: No.

306
00:19:43,127 --> 00:19:44,430
TRAVIS: Good question.

307
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:52,727
MATT: His eyes narrow and he looks for a moment
almost disappointed in confusion. "Just kill me

308
00:19:52,727 --> 00:19:55,525
"now. I grow impatient with this existence."

309
00:19:55,525 --> 00:19:59,718
TRAVIS: That's not a problem. Is there somewhere
where you would like to go after you die? Or are

310
00:19:59,718 --> 00:20:04,309
you going to wake up right after you die?

311
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:06,204
MATT: "I guess we'll find out."

312
00:20:06,204 --> 00:20:10,081
MARISHA: Yeah, and are you going to wake up like a
baby so we have like 20 years before we have to

313
00:20:10,081 --> 00:20:11,404
worry about you again?

314
00:20:11,404 --> 00:20:14,171
LAURA: Or are you like a zombie, straight,
straight away up and at 'em?

315
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,553
TRAVIS: He might come back as like a dog.

316
00:20:15,553 --> 00:20:19,601
MATT: "Please, please, kill me now. End this
paltry existence."

317
00:20:19,601 --> 00:20:22,203
LAURA: What if you come back as like a fish and
then you're screwed and stuck in the water?

318
00:20:22,203 --> 00:20:25,900
TRAVIS: Yeah, or like a penguin, so he's like a
bird that can't fly and he can only swim.

319
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,732
LAURA: And he's stuck waddling around. That'd be so
sad.

320
00:20:28,819 --> 00:20:38,975
LIAM: Uriel. As thanks for bringing you this gift,
we need to run Grog out once in a while. Might he

321
00:20:38,975 --> 00:20:43,923
have the honor of removing this shitstain from the
world?

322
00:20:43,923 --> 00:20:46,127
LAURA: Unless, of course, you'd like to do it
yourself.

323
00:20:46,127 --> 00:20:56,252
MATT: Uriel contemplates for a moment. "He's at
your disposal. I only ask that you do it soon and

324
00:20:56,252 --> 00:20:57,786
"in my sight."

325
00:20:57,786 --> 00:21:02,761
SAM: Are you sure there's no more useful
information we can get from this man?

326
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:15,069
LIAM: So, Riskel, Grog can do it kind of quickish
or take a very long time. I've seen him do it.

327
00:21:15,069 --> 00:21:17,087
TRAVIS: And I start stretching.

328
00:21:17,087 --> 00:21:21,222
LAURA: Digit by digit.

329
00:21:21,222 --> 00:21:27,840
LIAM: You can be sent on your way to whatever
asshole you think you're going to, but he can make

330
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,800
it very uncomfortable.

331
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:35,450
LAURA: He could strip you of all your limbs and
leave you hanging. Not dead.

332
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:37,736
LIAM: I once saw him kill a man with his
taint.

333
00:21:37,945 --> 00:21:40,851
SAM: With his own taint.

334
00:21:40,851 --> 00:21:43,854
MATT: Roll an intimidation check.

335
00:21:43,854 --> 00:21:46,614
TRAVIS: The taint intimidation.

336
00:21:46,614 --> 00:21:49,744
LIAM: So juicy.

337
00:21:49,744 --> 00:21:51,332
LAURA: Ew!

338
00:21:51,332 --> 00:21:53,809
TRAVIS: Like balsamic vinaigrette.

339
00:21:53,809 --> 00:21:56,204
TALIESIN: I've wanted to make this pun my entire
life.

340
00:21:56,204 --> 00:22:03,182
LIAM: Intimidation, you said. Oh, hell, I'm using
Luck in case I can do better. No, 17.

341
00:22:03,182 --> 00:22:10,689
TALIESIN: He taint intimidated. Got to get it out
of my system. I'm so sorry.

342
00:22:10,689 --> 00:22:18,916
MATT: You can see his eyes begin to roll back in
his head. "Do what you must." Begins to fade back

343
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:20,089
into unconsciousness.

344
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:24,147
LAURA: No, no, no. Wake up, wake up, wake up.
What's the marble? What's the little ball? What's

345
00:22:24,147 --> 00:22:25,399
it do?

346
00:22:25,399 --> 00:22:27,743
MATT: "I don't know what you're talking about."

347
00:22:27,743 --> 00:22:31,230
LAURA: Oh, then you're not very knowledgeable, are
you? I guess Vecna didn't tell you of his plans.

348
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:33,599
Not very important. Blood?

349
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:45,539
MATT: "The deal with my master is power through
not knowing. He is the one who knows all. The fact

350
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:49,150
"that he keeps it from us means that he trusts
us."

351
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,127
LAURA: That's the stupidest thing I've ever
heard.

352
00:22:51,127 --> 00:22:54,564
LIAM: All right, Grog, take off his little marble
please.

353
00:22:54,564 --> 00:22:58,125
SAM: Wait, wait, wait, wait. We're not going to
get any information out of him?

354
00:22:58,125 --> 00:23:03,110
TRAVIS: Well, maybe we should have Pike cleanse
his blood so he won't come back after he dies.

355
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:07,944
LAURA: That's a good idea! Pike, why don't you
bless him? Why don't you make him holy?

356
00:23:07,944 --> 00:23:15,174
MATT: His eyes dart around for a moment with a
look of sudden curiosity and worry.

357
00:23:15,174 --> 00:23:18,525
ASHLEY: Oh, I think that would be fun!

358
00:23:18,525 --> 00:23:22,086
MATT: "That's not possible."

359
00:23:22,086 --> 00:23:26,028
LAURA: Yes, it is. Sarenrae could always use new
servants. Right, Pike?

360
00:23:26,028 --> 00:23:27,853
ASHLEY: Yes, of course!

361
00:23:27,853 --> 00:23:30,475
TALIESIN: I've seen her regrow a foot. It's
amazing.

362
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:31,718
MATT: Deception check.

363
00:23:31,718 --> 00:23:35,323
LAURA: Aw, okay. Ooh, which one? All right. All
right.

364
00:23:35,323 --> 00:23:36,609
LIAM: The good one!

365
00:23:36,609 --> 00:23:44,220
LAURA: Aw, that's not the good one. 11. Do I get
advantage because Pike is helping?

366
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:49,321
MATT: Because she is helping with it and she is
the source of it, I'd say sure. Go ahead and roll

367
00:23:49,321 --> 00:23:50,780
with advantage.

368
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:54,596
LAURA: Haha! That's much better. 23!

369
00:23:54,596 --> 00:24:02,535
MATT: 23. Okay. You can see now at this point, his
breathing is quickened and he's swallowing more

370
00:24:02,535 --> 00:24:12,116
regularly. There's a look of sincere nervousness
in his eyes. "His power is great. There is nothing

371
00:24:12,116 --> 00:24:18,446
"this paltry little child of a being can do to keep
his will from his promise."

372
00:24:18,446 --> 00:24:20,082
LIAM: Oh, you shithead.

373
00:24:20,082 --> 00:24:26,342
ASHLEY: Well, maybe we'll just give it a try.

374
00:24:26,342 --> 00:24:29,384
TRAVIS: Do it! Do it!

375
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:35,506
ASHLEY: Okay, well, I'm going to walk over to him.
Just stay still. It's better on the light side, so

376
00:24:35,506 --> 00:24:36,867
hold on.

377
00:24:36,867 --> 00:24:40,830
TALIESIN: It worked for me. It was really quite
an experience.

378
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:44,969
MATT: "Master have mercy."

379
00:24:44,969 --> 00:24:47,606
TRAVIS: You're looking in the wrong direction.

380
00:24:47,606 --> 00:24:51,839
LAURA: I mean, do you know-- Unless you have
something to share with us. Do you know of his

381
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:53,188
awakening?

382
00:24:53,188 --> 00:24:54,477
TRAVIS: We could just let you go to him.

383
00:24:54,477 --> 00:25:00,272
LAURA: Do you have any details? Something that
could lead us to him? Your god of secrets?

384
00:25:00,272 --> 00:25:03,572
LIAM: No, he's too strong. Fill him with holy
light, Pike. Do it now.

385
00:25:03,572 --> 00:25:06,580
LAURA: You're right. And then he'll help us for
sure.

386
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,823
ASHLEY: Yeah, because maybe he'll remember and
tell us.

387
00:25:08,823 --> 00:25:09,904
LAURA: Yeah.

388
00:25:09,904 --> 00:25:20,522
ASHLEY: Okay. Wait. Am I doing Greater
Restoration?

389
00:25:20,522 --> 00:25:23,491
MATT: If you want to. It's whatever you want to
try.

390
00:25:23,491 --> 00:25:24,784
ASHLEY: Let's try it!

391
00:25:24,784 --> 00:25:33,389
MATT: Okay! So as you pull out your symbol of
Sarenrae, your metallic clinks of your feet across

392
00:25:33,389 --> 00:25:41,604
the sparse marble flooring. You approach as the
symbol glows. You can see in Pike's eyes, her

393
00:25:41,604 --> 00:25:47,022
pupils go white as the energy of Sarenrae's holy
blessing begins to spill out the sides. At each

394
00:25:47,022 --> 00:25:52,900
step, Riskel begins to twitch and pull away. He's
glancing about, looks towards you, Grog, with a

395
00:25:52,900 --> 00:26:04,210
look of "please, have pity." As Pike reaches out
to touch him, he goes, "I know little. It is the

396
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:18,640
"nature of his being. The ritual was once attempted
before. I know not if it worked. I was not there.

397
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,931
"You rushed in. It was not time. "

398
00:26:21,931 --> 00:26:26,592
LAURA: What did it need? What would have made it
time?

399
00:26:26,592 --> 00:26:37,872
MATT: "The Winter's Crest. The festival marks a
time where the barrier between the realms is thin.

400
00:26:37,872 --> 00:26:48,605
"Where the magic ley lines across this world cross
and swell. You forced our hand. I was not there. I

401
00:26:48,605 --> 00:26:52,155
"do not know the answer and I hope it was enough."

402
00:26:52,155 --> 00:26:54,754
LAURA: It probably wasn't.

403
00:26:54,754 --> 00:27:02,009
SAM: Are there plans to attempt this at the next
Winter's Crest that you know of?

404
00:27:02,009 --> 00:27:08,060
MATT: At this point you can see now this look of
despair hits his eyes, and then resolve. He goes

405
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:13,173
from this fearful moment to the realization that
he has already expressed more than he should. But

406
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:17,315
hopefully it's not too much to fall out of the
favor of his lord. And a smile creeps across his

407
00:27:17,315 --> 00:27:25,843
face for the first time since this whole thing and
he grins. "It is time." And he leans forward and

408
00:27:25,843 --> 00:27:27,889
puts his neck out.

409
00:27:27,889 --> 00:27:30,344
LAURA: Vecna's going to be so pissed at you.

410
00:27:30,344 --> 00:27:33,724
MARISHA: Have we tried to Restoration him first?

411
00:27:33,724 --> 00:27:35,690
SAM: Oh, yeah. She didn't do it yet.

412
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:36,953
MARISHA: She didn't do it yet, right?

413
00:27:36,953 --> 00:27:38,644
MATT: Did you want to cast the spell on him?

414
00:27:38,644 --> 00:27:39,819
LAURA: And then we'll kill him!

415
00:27:39,819 --> 00:27:40,988
MARISHA: Yeah.

416
00:27:40,988 --> 00:27:42,382
ASHLEY: Should I do it?

417
00:27:42,382 --> 00:27:43,964
SAM: Why not? We'll see what happens.

418
00:27:43,964 --> 00:27:47,893
LIAM: So I crouch down, take two fingers and I get
him by the nostrils and pull back the top of his

419
00:27:47,893 --> 00:27:56,875
head and say, "Do it, Pike. Pour in your holy
light right in his mouth. Give it all to him."

420
00:27:56,875 --> 00:28:01,540
MATT: Pike, as you reach forward, you take the
Sarenrae symbol and you jam it into his open mouth. As

421
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:08,039
it does-- yeah, just like that. A burst of divine
light comes spewing out the sides, and you see him

422
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:14,196
choking on some unseen force.

423
00:28:14,196 --> 00:28:15,683
MARISHA: A holy dick.

424
00:28:15,683 --> 00:28:21,630
MATT: Probably a combination of him swallowing his
own tongue, but as you pull the symbol back,

425
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:25,726
completing the spell of restoration, you can see
the energy pour through his body and he's shaking

426
00:28:25,726 --> 00:28:32,115
out of fear. His eyes begin to roll back, and from
the sound of it he's actually swallowing his own

427
00:28:32,115 --> 00:28:33,379
tongue.

428
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:35,648
LAURA: Oh! Did it kill him? Did Greater
Restoration just kill him?

429
00:28:35,648 --> 00:28:37,192
MATT: He's choking.

430
00:28:37,192 --> 00:28:43,165
TRAVIS: Hold on. Hold on. And I stick my fingers
into his mouth and I grab his tongue and pull it

431
00:28:43,165 --> 00:28:44,184
down to--

432
00:28:44,184 --> 00:28:46,727
LAURA: Oh gosh, this is so terrible.

433
00:28:46,727 --> 00:28:48,076
LIAM: This guy's an asshole!

434
00:28:48,076 --> 00:28:49,615
LAURA: I know. I know.

435
00:28:49,615 --> 00:28:52,125
TALIESIN: That's a big hand to get in there, man.
That's really uncomfortable.

436
00:28:52,125 --> 00:28:53,936
LIAM: He earned this grief.

437
00:28:53,936 --> 00:28:56,855
MATT: You hear Uriel's voice behind you say,
"Enough. Get it over with."

438
00:28:56,855 --> 00:28:59,192
(laughter)

439
00:28:59,192 --> 00:29:00,583
LAURA: Sorry. Sorry.

440
00:29:00,583 --> 00:29:02,274
SAM: All right. Good try, Pike. That was really
good.

441
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:04,065
LAURA: That was really awesome, Pike.

442
00:29:04,065 --> 00:29:06,527
TRAVIS: Nobody else has any other questions?

443
00:29:06,527 --> 00:29:09,662
TALIESIN: Just keep it clean so we can burn
everything afterwards.

444
00:29:09,662 --> 00:29:11,503
ASHLEY: Wait, what happened to him?

445
00:29:11,503 --> 00:29:18,482
TRAVIS: I take out Craven Edge, and I step back,
and with a huge swing aim right under his trin.

446
00:29:18,482 --> 00:29:19,462
LAURA: Trin?

447
00:29:19,462 --> 00:29:27,838
MATT: Trin. As the blade is drawn from Grog's
back, you can see it draws this trail of shadow

448
00:29:27,838 --> 00:29:35,480
behind it almost through the slow arc as he rears
it back for the swing. As the blade with a flash,

449
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:42,077
impossibly fast, arcs its way across Riskel's
throat, you can see his eyes open up with a sudden

450
00:29:42,077 --> 00:29:47,618
realization as the moment of pain and death hits
him. Then a smile draws across his lips as the

451
00:29:47,618 --> 00:29:57,529
head slowly rolls back. The blood then gouts out with the
last pumps of his heart. His body slumps forward,

452
00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:00,836
the guards holding him as they can, spilling a
pool out in the center of the floor.

453
00:30:00,836 --> 00:30:03,265
LAURA: Oh jeez, Uriel.

454
00:30:03,265 --> 00:30:16,227
MATT: As this happens, Grog, you feel this wave of
exhilaration. This almost ecstatic pulse of joy

455
00:30:16,227 --> 00:30:21,933
comes across your body. This sense of taking his
life with this blade, the first time you've really

456
00:30:21,933 --> 00:30:25,997
actually used it, was delightful.

457
00:30:25,997 --> 00:30:31,055
TRAVIS: I've got goose pimples. Was that good for
you guys or what?

458
00:30:31,055 --> 00:30:39,043
SAM: I don't know if you should be smiling this
much. You just killed a man. Have a little

459
00:30:39,043 --> 00:30:40,147
respect.

460
00:30:40,147 --> 00:30:42,425
TRAVIS: Yeah, but he was evil. Not happy time?

461
00:30:42,425 --> 00:30:44,761
TALIESIN: Quiet happy time.

462
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:52,856
MATT: Uriel stands up. "Guards, have this mess
cleaned. Burn the body. Thank you very much."

463
00:30:52,856 --> 00:30:55,897
TALIESIN: Really quickly, have we looted the body
already?

464
00:30:55,897 --> 00:30:57,681
LAURA: I feel like I did, didn't I? When he was
in--

465
00:30:57,681 --> 00:30:59,074
MATT: You did, you already looted the body.

466
00:30:59,074 --> 00:31:01,511
MARISHA: We did. We already got the skull with the
missing eye.

467
00:31:01,511 --> 00:31:04,807
TRAVIS: Can I turn to the side and go, how was
that?

468
00:31:04,807 --> 00:31:13,446
MATT: You hear the voice creep up and say, "Now we
see eye to eye."

469
00:31:13,446 --> 00:31:18,265
TRAVIS: I don't see you anywhere?

470
00:31:18,265 --> 00:31:21,939
(laughter)

471
00:31:21,939 --> 00:31:30,017
MATT: The aura of the shadow from the blade
retracts, and the blade becomes an onyx blade. It

472
00:31:30,017 --> 00:31:32,416
appears to have rescinded his presence.

473
00:31:32,416 --> 00:31:33,803
TRAVIS: He's shy.

474
00:31:33,803 --> 00:31:36,134
LIAM: I'm sorry, but it's like The Odd Couple.

475
00:31:36,134 --> 00:31:38,271
(laughter)

476
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:40,777
SAM: Craven Edge and Grog!

477
00:31:40,777 --> 00:31:46,295
ASHLEY: Oh man, I so badly want to fix that sword
to save Grog, but at the same time, I don't!

478
00:31:46,295 --> 00:31:49,403
(laughter)

479
00:31:49,403 --> 00:31:50,954
SAM: Sovereign?

480
00:31:50,954 --> 00:31:51,819
MATT: "Yes?"

481
00:31:51,819 --> 00:31:58,361
SAM: You know, I know we just talked earlier today
and everything, but it feels like we should get

482
00:31:58,361 --> 00:32:03,445
some sort of reward or something for capturing
this guy, doesn't it? I mean is that impolite to ask?

483
00:32:03,445 --> 00:32:07,942
TRAVIS: We did do it pretty expediently.

484
00:32:07,942 --> 00:32:10,733
SAM: It was the same day, wasn't it?

485
00:32:10,733 --> 00:32:18,974
MATT: "It was." And he sits there for a second and
nods his head. "Very well. We were prepared to put

486
00:32:18,974 --> 00:32:25,055
"out a bounty for his arrest, and I feel it would
only be fair to provide you with this bounty." He

487
00:32:25,055 --> 00:32:28,877
snaps his fingers. A guard comes up and he
whispers to him for a second. As he walks away,

488
00:32:28,877 --> 00:32:34,852
"You will have a sum of 5,000 gold pieces
delivered to Greyskull Keep this evening."

489
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:36,861
SAM: Thank you.

490
00:32:36,861 --> 00:32:42,477
MATT: "I appreciate it. Now please, be on your
way. I have business to attend to. Thank you very much."

491
00:32:42,477 --> 00:32:44,340
TALIESIN: Good evening, your lordship.

492
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,916
MATT: He gets up and walks away.

493
00:32:45,916 --> 00:32:47,323
TRAVIS: 5,000?

494
00:32:47,323 --> 00:32:49,959
LAURA: Feel like it could have been more,
honestly. Whatever.

495
00:32:49,959 --> 00:32:52,681
TRAVIS: Really? It's a lot.

496
00:32:52,681 --> 00:32:55,284
LAURA: Should I add that now, or should I wait
until it actually gets delivered?

497
00:32:55,284 --> 00:32:58,208
SAM: Probably when it gets delivered. It could be
intercepted and stolen on the way.

498
00:32:58,208 --> 00:32:59,321
TALIESIN: A lot could happen.

499
00:32:59,321 --> 00:33:01,579
TRAVIS: Why would you even say that? Why would you
even put that out there?

500
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:04,817
LAURA: What should we do? Should we go home,
then?

501
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:08,555
SAM: I suppose so. It's been a long day. We've
taken damage today. We should go home.

502
00:33:08,555 --> 00:33:10,561
ASHLEY: Yeah. We should go heal.

503
00:33:10,561 --> 00:33:13,523
TRAVIS: Wasn't there something we were going to
do, though?

504
00:33:13,523 --> 00:33:15,158
MARISHA: What time is it?

505
00:33:15,158 --> 00:33:19,473
MATT: By now, the sun's probably set, and so as
you step out of the palace, you look up at the

506
00:33:19,473 --> 00:33:25,986
skyline. Little plumes of clouds throughout,
but you can see the distinct bright oranges and

507
00:33:25,986 --> 00:33:32,665
purples of sunset have taken, and to the far east,
you can see the dark blue of creeping night.

508
00:33:32,665 --> 00:33:35,427
LIAM: How long has the sun been down?

509
00:33:35,427 --> 00:33:40,118
MATT: It just set. It's heading toward dusk.

510
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:41,752
LIAM: Who wants to get a drink?

511
00:33:41,752 --> 00:33:42,868
MARISHA: Yeah!

512
00:33:42,868 --> 00:33:45,720
SAM: We were just in a tavern all day.

513
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,098
MARISHA: Yeah, but that was work.

514
00:33:48,098 --> 00:33:52,287
TRAVIS: We weren't really drinking. We were
pretend drinking. We could be real drinking.

515
00:33:52,287 --> 00:33:56,762
MARISHA: Were we supposed to be pretend-- yeah,
sure.

516
00:33:56,762 --> 00:34:03,150
LAURA: Now the door incident really makes sense,
if some of us were really drinking in that

517
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:04,403
tavern.

518
00:34:04,403 --> 00:34:09,029
TRAVIS: That, or we just hate doors. Let's go get
a drink!

519
00:34:09,029 --> 00:34:10,612
TALIESIN: I'm all right with that.

520
00:34:10,612 --> 00:34:12,364
SAM: Same tavern?

521
00:34:12,364 --> 00:34:14,616
ALL: No.

522
00:34:14,616 --> 00:34:17,623
MARISHA: Let's go to old faithful. Where's old
faithful?

523
00:34:17,623 --> 00:34:21,255
MATT: Old faithful, technically, would be the
Laughing Lamia, which is where you guys originally

524
00:34:21,255 --> 00:34:23,082
stayed when you first came to Emon.

525
00:34:23,082 --> 00:34:24,643
TALIESIN: Let's do faithful.

526
00:34:24,643 --> 00:34:26,418
TRAVIS: Or do we want to branch out?

527
00:34:26,418 --> 00:34:28,062
MARISHA: Find a new place?

528
00:34:28,062 --> 00:34:30,755
TRAVIS: Yeah. Taste some new ale!

529
00:34:30,755 --> 00:34:32,554
TALIESIN: Let's start a pub crawl.

530
00:34:32,554 --> 00:34:36,430
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Pub crawl!

531
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:38,178
LAURA: I like it a lot.

532
00:34:38,178 --> 00:34:39,454
TRAVIS: You are a smart one.

533
00:34:39,454 --> 00:34:41,104
LAURA: What's the closest pub here?

534
00:34:41,104 --> 00:34:43,134
MATT: Who's leading the pub crawl?

535
00:34:43,134 --> 00:34:49,880
SAM: Wait, hold on. (high-pitched cries)

536
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,729
I'm Yelping it.

537
00:34:51,729 --> 00:34:54,575
(laughter)

538
00:34:54,575 --> 00:34:57,636
SAM: No?

539
00:34:57,636 --> 00:35:01,813
TALIESIN: I feel so much better for every terrible
thing I've said. Oh my god.

540
00:35:01,813 --> 00:35:05,517
LAURA: That was the worst one you've ever said.

541
00:35:05,517 --> 00:35:11,058
(laughter)

542
00:35:11,058 --> 00:35:12,652
LAURA: You're going to lose experience points for
this.

543
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,261
TRAVIS: I feel like my intelligence went down
one.

544
00:35:14,261 --> 00:35:22,485
MATT: There's no ruleset for reverse inspiration.
But I'm going to start looking into designing that.

545
00:35:22,485 --> 00:35:25,893
LIAM: The entire party's intelligence goes to
one.

546
00:35:25,893 --> 00:35:32,339
TALIESIN: You get a 1d10 bonus against a roll
versus him. It's to knock him down a peg.

547
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:37,027
MATT: It's like the fate chips system. It's great.
Okay. So who's heading the pub crawl?

548
00:35:37,027 --> 00:35:38,527
TALIESIN: Am I heading the pub crawl?

549
00:35:38,527 --> 00:35:41,299
SAM: You don't know this town. Who knows this town
the best?

550
00:35:41,299 --> 00:35:42,652
LAURA: None of us know this town.

551
00:35:42,652 --> 00:35:46,474
MARISHA: I mean, it's technically our town. We
should get to know our city, you guys.

552
00:35:46,474 --> 00:35:49,543
TALIESIN: All right. I'm walking in a direction.

553
00:35:49,543 --> 00:35:51,345
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make an
investigation check.

554
00:35:51,345 --> 00:35:57,984
TALIESIN: All right. I'm going to use a different
die because it's funnier that way. That's an

555
00:35:57,984 --> 00:35:59,071
eight.

556
00:35:59,071 --> 00:36:00,417
LAURA: Oh, good.

557
00:36:00,417 --> 00:36:01,903
TRAVIS: You can't really do this wrong.

558
00:36:01,903 --> 00:36:03,535
MATT: You'd be surprised.

559
00:36:03,535 --> 00:36:05,371
(laughter)

560
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:13,341
MATT: Over the next couple hours, you meander a
while through Abdar's Promenade, there are a

561
00:36:13,341 --> 00:36:15,892
couple dives, but the clientele doesn't seem very
jovial.

562
00:36:15,892 --> 00:36:19,926
LAURA: This is the worst pub crawl ever! This took
two hours?

563
00:36:19,926 --> 00:36:24,533
MATT: Yeah. You find about four different
establishments, but most of them appear to be less

564
00:36:24,533 --> 00:36:28,246
of the "party hardy" crowd and more of the "my
life sucks, I need alcohol" crowd.

565
00:36:28,246 --> 00:36:33,988
TALIESIN: Scanlan? Scanlan? I feel we need you.
I'm still recovering my spirit here.

566
00:36:33,988 --> 00:36:34,999
SAM: All right.

567
00:36:34,999 --> 00:36:40,859
Do you need me to yelp it again? All right, I
will roll an investigation.

568
00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:42,186
TALIESIN: It couldn't hurt.

569
00:36:42,186 --> 00:36:45,254
SAM: All right. Let me talk to some people and see
if I can find some things. Investigation? 18.

570
00:36:45,254 --> 00:36:51,158
MATT: 18. Chatting around--

571
00:36:51,158 --> 00:36:58,925
SAM: Where's a good place to go? I'm looking for a
speakeasy. Something off the beaten path.

572
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:04,881
MATT: Something off the beaten path. Word of mouth
type place. Okay. Let's see.

573
00:37:04,881 --> 00:37:08,145
LAURA: Oh! I like that he's checking out his
Yellow Pages.

574
00:37:08,145 --> 00:37:13,195
LIAM: Matt's thinking about all the battle maps he
drew over the last week, and we're doing a pub

575
00:37:13,195 --> 00:37:14,250
crawl.

576
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,755
TALIESIN: It's like, "Fine. We're doing a pub
crawl."

577
00:37:15,755 --> 00:37:17,871
MATT: Hey, man. Nothing wrong with that.

578
00:37:17,871 --> 00:37:20,984
SAM: Or just a place that comes highly
recommended.

579
00:37:20,984 --> 00:37:24,148
TALIESIN: Or poorly recommended.

580
00:37:24,148 --> 00:37:34,395
MATT: So, you eventually hear about a place called
Howarth's. Howarth's.

581
00:37:34,395 --> 00:37:38,870
MARISHA: Like H-O-A--

582
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,649
MATT: Howarth's.

583
00:37:40,649 --> 00:37:44,677
LAURA: Have we been to Howarth's?

584
00:37:44,677 --> 00:37:46,554
LIAM: He just made it up. We've not been there.

585
00:37:46,554 --> 00:37:48,600
MARISHA: Like Woolworth's, but Halworth's?

586
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,247
MATT: Sure.

587
00:37:50,247 --> 00:37:53,174
ASHLEY: Like "Hogwarts" without the G?

588
00:37:53,174 --> 00:38:02,351
MATT: I guess you'd say. Howarth's. When you get
there, it appears to be more of a textile

589
00:38:02,351 --> 00:38:10,501
business, but from what you've heard, it's more a
business that runs the front, and then the real

590
00:38:10,501 --> 00:38:12,591
company is in the back.

591
00:38:12,591 --> 00:38:13,678
LAURA: Nice.

592
00:38:13,678 --> 00:38:15,559
TALIESIN: Textiles and beer?

593
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:16,452
MATT: Yes.

594
00:38:16,452 --> 00:38:17,348
TALIESIN: Okay.

595
00:38:17,348 --> 00:38:21,107
MATT: So as soon as you guys approach, the guy
who's running the front, who's this

596
00:38:21,107 --> 00:38:26,826
weaselly-looking, mousy gentleman in his late 40s,
thin John Waters mustache, gives you a nod and

597
00:38:26,826 --> 00:38:30,900
says, "I take it you're not here for the-- yeah.
Just around the corner. Back room." Points you

598
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:37,367
over. As you guys walk in, there's a pretty
happening establishment in here. There's a harp

599
00:38:37,367 --> 00:38:44,211
player on the far edge of the room on the stage,
who's playing a very beautiful piece. Even though

600
00:38:44,211 --> 00:38:51,577
she's just playing the harp, it's almost emanating
the sound of multiple instruments. There's

601
00:38:51,577 --> 00:38:56,630
probably about ten or so people in here. It's not
extremely crowded, but everyone in there appears

602
00:38:56,630 --> 00:39:02,557
to be rather upper crust folks that either have
descended from the Cloudtop District to rub

603
00:39:02,557 --> 00:39:10,177
shoulders with the less elite of the town and a
few wealthy merchants. It's a pretty decent place

604
00:39:10,177 --> 00:39:12,662
for rabble rousers who have some coin to spend.

605
00:39:12,662 --> 00:39:14,362
TRAVIS: That's us.

606
00:39:14,362 --> 00:39:15,742
SAM: Let's get a round, shall we?

607
00:39:15,742 --> 00:39:19,854
LAURA: Yeah. Oh, I would say you could buy,
Scanlan, but you have no money.

608
00:39:19,854 --> 00:39:21,349
SAM: You gave me a thousand gold.

609
00:39:21,349 --> 00:39:22,977
LAURA: I did, so you have enough to buy for
everyone.

610
00:39:22,977 --> 00:39:25,339
SAM: I'm feeling generous. I'll buy us a round.

611
00:39:25,339 --> 00:39:35,616
MATT: All right. You guys get a round of drinks.
You look over the events of the previous weeks.

612
00:39:35,616 --> 00:39:42,587
You chat amongst yourselves and you meet a few
individuals in the establishment and make a few

613
00:39:42,587 --> 00:39:47,840
friends. Overall, it's a pretty decent way to
finish a rather long day of more work than you had

614
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:54,028
originally anticipated. As the buzz begins to wear
off and the evening draws to a close, you guys

615
00:39:54,028 --> 00:39:57,448
find yourselves getting a little hungry and this
place is pretty much solely a bar experience, as

616
00:39:57,448 --> 00:40:02,916
opposed to a straight pub, and it's probably
pushing close to 11.

617
00:40:02,916 --> 00:40:04,706
SAM: Should we go home?

618
00:40:04,706 --> 00:40:11,858
MARISHA: No! Guys. The evening is our-- what do
they say about things like that? The evening is

619
00:40:11,858 --> 00:40:14,085
our oyster. Right? Isn't that what they say?

620
00:40:14,085 --> 00:40:15,213
LAURA: Sure.

621
00:40:15,213 --> 00:40:16,615
ASHLEY: Yeah, close.

622
00:40:16,615 --> 00:40:17,518
MARISHA: What?

623
00:40:17,518 --> 00:40:19,857
ASHLEY: No, I said it's pretty close.

624
00:40:19,857 --> 00:40:27,775
MARISHA: Oh, thank you, Pike. Let's stay out all
night. Come on.

625
00:40:27,775 --> 00:40:29,607
LIAM: Come on, old man!

626
00:40:29,607 --> 00:40:36,785
MARISHA: We can see the sunrise. We never do this.
We never take time for ourselves.

627
00:40:36,785 --> 00:40:39,429
LAURA: Oh no. Keyleth's been day-drinking and
night-drinking.

628
00:40:39,555 --> 00:40:40,819
MARISHA: I have.

629
00:40:40,819 --> 00:40:42,459
SAM: She's that girl.

630
00:40:42,459 --> 00:40:44,143
MARISHA: Come on, you guys.

631
00:40:44,143 --> 00:40:46,631
LIAM: I'm walking up to the barkeep and I say,
Hi!

632
00:40:46,631 --> 00:40:48,140
LAURA: Oh god, that's so loud.

633
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:52,261
LIAM: We need to keep drinking, but also eating,
so where's the closest place to do that?

634
00:40:52,261 --> 00:40:53,727
MARISHA: Yes!

635
00:40:53,727 --> 00:41:00,520
MATT: "At this hour?" And the gentleman who's
talking to you now, his chin appears to have been

636
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:04,636
broken at some point in his life so as he talks
the jaw swivels from side to side in an awkward,

637
00:41:04,636 --> 00:41:11,859
old Disney cartoon way. It's hard to really put
into words. His hair is spotty in places, it's

638
00:41:11,859 --> 00:41:16,219
thinning in the front, but he's well-dressed. It's
one of those things where the outfit does not

639
00:41:16,219 --> 00:41:23,224
match the persona. But he looks over to you and,
"Well, sir, at this point in the evening, food

640
00:41:23,224 --> 00:41:25,711
"might be a little hard to procure,
unfortunately."

641
00:41:25,711 --> 00:41:26,778
LAURA: Oh, really?

642
00:41:26,778 --> 00:41:28,071
MATT: "As far as I know."

643
00:41:28,071 --> 00:41:30,161
MARISHA: Guys, there's got to be like some street
vendors. Come on.

644
00:41:30,161 --> 00:41:41,618
TALIESIN: I'm going to find the most interesting,
boisterous clientele in the bar and I'm going to

645
00:41:41,618 --> 00:41:42,903
approach them.

646
00:41:42,903 --> 00:41:44,453
TRAVIS: Yeah, we getting in a fight?

647
00:41:44,453 --> 00:41:45,493
TALIESIN: No.

648
00:41:45,493 --> 00:41:46,773
LIAM: Not yet.

649
00:41:46,773 --> 00:41:49,126
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a perception check.

650
00:41:49,126 --> 00:41:58,506
TALIESIN: Thank you for that. Yes! That's much
better. 20.

651
00:41:58,506 --> 00:42:02,602
MATT: Okay. As you're glancing about and you're
talking to the bar, and the rest of you guys are

652
00:42:02,602 --> 00:42:07,185
finishing a round of drinks, you are looking
around--

653
00:42:07,185 --> 00:42:10,840
LAURA: I just remembered 5,000 gold is being
delivered to the keep.

654
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:14,512
SAM: Don't worry. We have servants.

655
00:42:14,512 --> 00:42:16,469
MARISHA: We have servants. It's fine.

656
00:42:16,469 --> 00:42:17,912
TRAVIS: Drink more.

657
00:42:17,912 --> 00:42:30,090
MATT: So you glance towards the door and an
individual walks in that definitely matches the

658
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:35,584
expectation of what you're looking for. A familiar
individual. A gentleman of purple-gold trimmed

659
00:42:35,584 --> 00:42:45,258
robes, a darkish complexion, a tied goatee, and a
smile on his face. And it suddenly makes complete

660
00:42:45,258 --> 00:42:48,677
sense this is the kind of place that Gilmore would
go to drink.

661
00:42:48,677 --> 00:42:53,411
(cheering)

662
00:42:53,411 --> 00:42:57,350
MATT: As he comes strolling in, he has a smile on
his face. You can see a bit of sweat on his brow.

663
00:42:57,350 --> 00:43:01,534
He's had a long day and is in a rush here, looks
over, and immediately sees all of you there.

664
00:43:01,534 --> 00:43:04,874
"Well, isn't this the luckiest day for me!"

665
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:08,145
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Gilmore!

666
00:43:08,145 --> 00:43:10,242
LIAM: Look at this motherfucker right here!

667
00:43:10,242 --> 00:43:14,658
MATT: "Vax'ildan!" He runs up and grabs you and
(kiss kiss).

668
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:20,349
LIAM: Oh, I lift him. I lift him in the air and
twirl him around and I put him down on a bar stool

669
00:43:20,349 --> 00:43:27,194
and I give him a playful slap on the cheek. Not
that hard, but like. How are you? It's so good to

670
00:43:27,194 --> 00:43:28,908
see you! God, you look good.

671
00:43:28,908 --> 00:43:30,946
MATT: "You as well, my friend, you as well."

672
00:43:30,946 --> 00:43:37,114
MARISHA: Gilmore! Gilmore. What are you drinking?
We're buying. What are you drinking?

673
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:38,989
MATT: "Oh, obviously whatever she's having."

674
00:43:38,989 --> 00:43:41,343
LIAM: Do you have any food? They don't have any.

675
00:43:41,343 --> 00:43:45,907
MATT: "They don't have any. They would not serve
food here. No, it's a finer establishment."

676
00:43:45,907 --> 00:43:48,298
LAURA: Where can we go for food, Gilmore?

677
00:43:48,298 --> 00:43:55,682
MATT: "Um." And he thinks for a second. He reaches
back into a small satchel he has at his side and

678
00:43:55,682 --> 00:44:02,911
he pulls out a little pouch. He opens the pouch,
and he reaches out and he pulls out a small wooden

679
00:44:02,911 --> 00:44:07,776
domino, like in size. "If you wouldn't mind
clearing some of these tables for me?"

680
00:44:07,776 --> 00:44:09,877
SAM: Oh sure, sure. Grog?

681
00:44:09,877 --> 00:44:12,227
TRAVIS: Not a problem. Stand up, you lot!

682
00:44:12,227 --> 00:44:17,979
MATT: (laughs) Unnecessarily knocking over the
drinks off the table of one of the nearby

683
00:44:17,979 --> 00:44:22,001
individuals, but they don't argue with the
goliath.

684
00:44:22,001 --> 00:44:24,050
TRAVIS: It's clear. (laughs)

685
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:30,716
MATT: Takes apart some room. He gives a nod over
to the bartender, who you can see there's been a

686
00:44:30,716 --> 00:44:34,507
rapport here, so he's like, all right, I'll allow
it. He tosses the wooden domino on the ground for

687
00:44:34,507 --> 00:44:39,265
a second, whispers something under his breath,
does a hand gesture, and it suddenly extends into

688
00:44:39,265 --> 00:44:43,497
a wooden table. Into a familiar sight. This is a
Heroes' Feast.

689
00:44:43,497 --> 00:44:46,596
(cheering)

690
00:44:46,596 --> 00:44:48,735
SAM: Gilmore!

691
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:50,181
MARISHA: These things are not cheap.

692
00:44:50,181 --> 00:44:51,640
ASHLEY: Gilmore!

693
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:55,969
MATT: You can see in his other hand the
gem-encrusted chalice from the middle of his pouch

694
00:44:55,969 --> 00:45:02,173
dissipates in the arcane energy. He says, "Well, I
figured it was a special occasion."

695
00:45:02,173 --> 00:45:03,925
LAURA: Darling.

696
00:45:03,925 --> 00:45:09,178
SAM: Wow, Gilmore, this is too much! Really. This
is amazing. You're such a kind, generous soul.

697
00:45:09,178 --> 00:45:14,927
MATT: "Actually, I've gotten word that you've been
spreading the wonders of my brand, though--"

698
00:45:14,927 --> 00:45:16,066
TRAVIS: (laughs) That's true.

699
00:45:16,066 --> 00:45:17,666
LAURA: Everywhere we go.

700
00:45:17,666 --> 00:45:21,546
MATT: "That's not true, but you've been doing it a
bit, which is more than I expected, to be honest.

701
00:45:21,546 --> 00:45:23,371
"So I appreciate that, I really do."

702
00:45:23,371 --> 00:45:26,827
SAM: Not only that, we've, I don't know if word
has reached you yet, but in Whitestone we're

703
00:45:26,827 --> 00:45:34,271
working towards establishing a Gilmore-themed
library for the people with your name attached to it.

704
00:45:34,271 --> 00:45:36,535
MATT: "Well."

705
00:45:36,535 --> 00:45:38,565
SAM: Something respectable for a change!

706
00:45:38,565 --> 00:45:43,586
MATT: "Oh, I don't know about that. I've still got
to finish building my shop in Westruun, but when

707
00:45:43,586 --> 00:45:46,598
"that is done, I'll be more than happy to look into
it."

708
00:45:46,598 --> 00:45:48,260
SAM: If you need any help, count on us.

709
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:51,725
MATT: "Whitestone. Whitestone. Hmm. Place has been
kind of dour as of late."

710
00:45:51,725 --> 00:45:53,528
LAURA: Up-and-coming. I tell you that much.

711
00:45:53,528 --> 00:45:56,353
TALIESIN: Really turning around. Really turning
around.

712
00:45:56,353 --> 00:46:01,761
LIAM: You can turn a coin and do right by the
world. They are in need, and that place is going

713
00:46:01,761 --> 00:46:04,928
to explode, I'm telling you. Can I get another
drink, please?

714
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:10,200
MARISHA: They're even changing the name, they're
making it more hip, it's going to be called WhiSto

715
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,611
now. It's great. Just shortening it.

716
00:46:12,611 --> 00:46:14,341
TALIESIN: Another for her as well.

717
00:46:14,341 --> 00:46:16,188
SAM: She's had one drink.

718
00:46:16,188 --> 00:46:20,245
MARISHA: This is great.

719
00:46:20,245 --> 00:46:22,696
TRAVIS: When do we tell her that's a Shirley
Temple?

720
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:25,933
(laughter)

721
00:46:25,933 --> 00:46:28,406
MARISHA: Look, it's been fermenting for a while.

722
00:46:28,406 --> 00:46:32,199
TRAVIS: So hammered off this cherry juice, you
guys. (laughs)

723
00:46:32,199 --> 00:46:37,393
MATT: So as the drinks continue to flow, you guys
swap stories, you converse. The evening is drawing

724
00:46:37,393 --> 00:46:41,420
closer to like the 1:30-2:00 in the morning, at
this point. Most of the other patrons have

725
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:47,528
filtered out of the bar. The Heroes' Feast, after
finishing being consumed, itself has reverted back

726
00:46:47,528 --> 00:46:51,615
down to the wooden domino, which is a different
enchantment to what you're used to. Your more

727
00:46:51,615 --> 00:46:57,145
druidic, divine-based Heroes' Feast you summon out
of the actual element. This is almost an implement

728
00:46:57,145 --> 00:47:00,386
or a focus he uses for the spell each time. It's a
different way of getting the same effect.

729
00:47:00,386 --> 00:47:05,776
Interesting to you, not being an arcane caster.
But nevertheless, as it winds down a bit, you guys

730
00:47:05,776 --> 00:47:09,468
are all finding yourselves settling in.

731
00:47:09,468 --> 00:47:12,926
LAURA: Can I sit down and talk to Gilmore for a
moment?

732
00:47:12,926 --> 00:47:14,124
MATT: Of course.

733
00:47:14,124 --> 00:47:17,317
MARISHA: And Keyleth gets up and moves and sits
next to Vax.

734
00:47:17,317 --> 00:47:18,516
MATT: Okay.

735
00:47:18,516 --> 00:47:20,416
SAM: I go and challenge Grog to a dart game.

736
00:47:20,416 --> 00:47:21,895
TRAVIS: Yes.

737
00:47:21,895 --> 00:47:25,777
LAURA: Gilmore?

738
00:47:25,777 --> 00:47:27,837
MATT: "Yes, my dear?"

739
00:47:27,837 --> 00:47:32,333
LAURA: We ran into a really weird thing in
Whitestone, and I bet you know some shit about it,

740
00:47:32,333 --> 00:47:34,574
because you know shit about everything.

741
00:47:34,574 --> 00:47:37,118
MATT: "Weird things in particular, is that what
you're insinuating?"

742
00:47:37,118 --> 00:47:38,223
LAURA: Kind of, yeah.

743
00:47:38,223 --> 00:47:39,888
MATT: "All right, fair enough."

744
00:47:39,888 --> 00:47:41,394
LAURA: Vecna?

745
00:47:41,394 --> 00:47:50,004
MATT: The moment you say that, you see his jovial
exterior harden for a second, and his eyes close

746
00:47:50,004 --> 00:47:53,285
and he goes, "That's a strange name to bring up
this late in the evening."

747
00:47:53,285 --> 00:47:54,514
LAURA: Bad news bears, right?

748
00:47:54,514 --> 00:47:55,517
MATT: "Yeah."

749
00:47:55,517 --> 00:48:03,009
LAURA: Yeah. Yeah. I kind of almost died. (laughs)
Because of him, I guess.

750
00:48:03,009 --> 00:48:06,077
MATT: "Almost is better than actually, so
congratulations."

751
00:48:06,077 --> 00:48:13,514
LAURA: Thank you. But yeah. There's a spinning
ball of death, really. An orb that sucks things

752
00:48:13,514 --> 00:48:21,485
into it. It's black. It's underground. We don't
know what to do with it really and I'm kind of

753
00:48:21,485 --> 00:48:23,903
worried, I guess, about it.

754
00:48:23,903 --> 00:48:26,516
MATT: "Spinning black orb of death..."

755
00:48:26,516 --> 00:48:31,208
LAURA: They were trying to wake him up, but they
said it was too early. They did it before Winter's Crest.

756
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:38,621
MATT: He thinks for a second and says, "The only
orb of spinning death I'm familiar with is a

757
00:48:38,621 --> 00:48:43,805
"Sphere of Annihilation, but those are generally a
bit larger than what you're describing to me, at

758
00:48:43,805 --> 00:48:45,144
"the very least."

759
00:48:45,144 --> 00:48:50,514
LAURA: Well, I feel like maybe they wanted it to
get bigger? I don't know. Oh! Oh! There was a

760
00:48:50,514 --> 00:48:52,113
hand, and an eye, and--

761
00:48:52,113 --> 00:48:57,573
MATT: "Those generally follow around the phrase
'Vecna'."

762
00:48:57,573 --> 00:48:58,776
LAURA: Oh, really?

763
00:48:58,776 --> 00:49:03,410
MATT: "I don't know too much other than what I've
been told historically, and bits of information

764
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:10,712
"that I've picked up through the years. Vecna..."
And he thinks for a second, he starts looking

765
00:49:10,712 --> 00:49:15,682
about if anyone else is near the table, you guys
are off and throwing darts.

766
00:49:15,682 --> 00:49:18,251
TALIESIN: I'm listening in.

767
00:49:18,251 --> 00:49:19,612
MATT: Okay.

768
00:49:19,612 --> 00:49:21,792
TALIESIN: Pike, I don't know where you are, but I
assume you're still--

769
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,297
ASHLEY: I'm listening. I'm listening.

770
00:49:23,297 --> 00:49:31,310
MATT: Okay. "Vecna. He has many names
historically. The Archlich. The Whispered One. The

771
00:49:31,310 --> 00:49:39,343
"Dying King. The Lord of the Rotted Tower. The
Undying King. Gods like titles, it seems. A bit

772
00:49:39,343 --> 00:49:50,022
"arrogant, in my opinion. From what I heard, he was
born a mortal. Used his capabilities to attempt to

773
00:49:50,022 --> 00:49:54,382
"cheat death in every way possible, and then once
that was acquired, naturally went on to the next

774
00:49:54,382 --> 00:50:02,605
"great endeavor: becoming a god. He attempted to
ascend six hundred years ago. But in that time his

775
00:50:02,605 --> 00:50:13,229
"cult expanded across the rebuilding civilization.
Nearly achieved it until it seemed that the

776
00:50:13,229 --> 00:50:24,192
"remnants of good in society went and followed him
to his place of worship and thwarted his ritual.

777
00:50:24,192 --> 00:50:35,663
"He was slain, but as you've seen, when entities of
such power get to a certain point, death is but a

778
00:50:35,663 --> 00:50:41,755
"hurdle. You have enough individuals that believe
you're a god, that willpower is strong enough to

779
00:50:41,755 --> 00:50:51,256
"keep you enduring. So his influence exists and has
for many years. I don't know if he's a god per se,

780
00:50:51,256 --> 00:51:00,555
"not yet, but there are those that treat him as
such, and that in itself is dangerous because that

781
00:51:00,555 --> 00:51:07,743
"means he's probably still out there. And I'm
pretty sure he's very interested in finishing what

782
00:51:07,743 --> 00:51:09,449
"he couldn't before."

783
00:51:09,449 --> 00:51:12,821
LAURA: What was he-- Just trying to be a god, is
it?

784
00:51:12,821 --> 00:51:17,923
MATT: "That's all I've heard. Not a scholar of the
religious rites, and for the most part a lot of

785
00:51:17,923 --> 00:51:25,647
"his history's been, well, destroyed and kept
secret. It's his bailiwick."

786
00:51:25,647 --> 00:51:28,478
LAURA: It's his thing. Well.

787
00:51:28,478 --> 00:51:34,518
MATT: "But anyway. If you've indeed come across
any of this foul business, I recommend you stay

788
00:51:34,518 --> 00:51:41,002
"far away. Far away! Bad news."

789
00:51:41,002 --> 00:51:42,454
LAURA: Bad news.

790
00:51:42,454 --> 00:51:47,948
MATT: "Yes. Anyway, sorry, dour subject. Didn't
mean to bring the mood down on that one."

791
00:51:47,948 --> 00:51:53,015
LAURA: Don't worry. It helped. Helped us.

792
00:51:53,015 --> 00:52:01,324
SAM: Well, it's been a fun night, guys, but I'm
tired of letting Grog beat me at darts.

793
00:52:01,324 --> 00:52:04,488
TRAVIS: You really suck. I don't know if it's
because you're so tiny--

794
00:52:04,488 --> 00:52:07,201
SAM: They put the dart board so high on the wall!

795
00:52:07,201 --> 00:52:11,150
TRAVIS: Yeah, but you put darts in two people's
arms, I mean, are you really that--

796
00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:13,454
SAM: Well, one of those people was giving us the
stink-eye.

797
00:52:13,454 --> 00:52:16,921
TRAVIS: That's true. He squealed out like a little
girl, too.

798
00:52:16,921 --> 00:52:19,194
SAM: But we should go home.

799
00:52:19,194 --> 00:52:20,444
MARISHA: What?

800
00:52:20,444 --> 00:52:21,689
SAM: We should go home.

801
00:52:21,689 --> 00:52:22,665
MARISHA: Noooo.

802
00:52:22,665 --> 00:52:27,144
SAM: Keyleth, please, don't be this way. We'll go
out again tomorrow. It'll be fine.

803
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:34,183
MARISHA: You say that now, and then tomorrow some
crazy person will show up at our door and want us

804
00:52:34,183 --> 00:52:37,303
to do something crazy and then we'll never have a
free night again.

805
00:52:37,303 --> 00:52:38,702
SAM: I'm super old. Let's go.

806
00:52:38,702 --> 00:52:43,148
TRAVIS: You know what's really cool to do at the
end of the night actually that will make you be

807
00:52:43,148 --> 00:52:48,136
there for the sun coming up, is if you do four
shots of firewater in a row.

808
00:52:48,136 --> 00:52:49,513
MARISHA: What?

809
00:52:49,513 --> 00:52:54,642
TRAVIS: Yeah. It's a thing. It reinvigorates you,
but you got to do them back to back to back to back.

810
00:52:54,642 --> 00:52:56,156
SAM: I do hear that cures the hangover.

811
00:52:56,156 --> 00:52:59,350
TALIESIN: I was going to encourage. No. I'm going
to encourage this now. I think this is a great idea.

812
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:04,627
TRAVIS: Listen, listen. Only because I'm
identifying with your need for revelry, why don't

813
00:53:04,627 --> 00:53:06,742
you and I go do four shots back to back to back to
back?

814
00:53:06,742 --> 00:53:08,136
MARISHA: Let's do it!

815
00:53:08,136 --> 00:53:13,037
MATT: As you guys stand up and walk away, Gilmore
looks to you and goes, "I like her much better

816
00:53:13,037 --> 00:53:14,566
"this way."

817
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:17,755
MARISHA: Gilmore, I love you too!

818
00:53:17,755 --> 00:53:21,789
TRAVIS: Actually, you stay here. I'll bring it to
the table. And I go and get the shots.

819
00:53:21,789 --> 00:53:27,011
MATT: All of your drinks for the evening are paid
for, Gilmore takes care of the tab.

820
00:53:27,011 --> 00:53:28,819
LAURA: Oh my gosh, Gilmore!

821
00:53:28,819 --> 00:53:30,478
ASHLEY: Gilmore!

822
00:53:30,478 --> 00:53:32,514
MATT: You come back with the shots--

823
00:53:32,514 --> 00:53:35,165
ASHLEY: Oh wait, I want one, then!

824
00:53:35,165 --> 00:53:37,472
MATT: All right! Pike gets a shot.

825
00:53:37,472 --> 00:53:39,063
TRAVIS: Nine shots. Ten shots.

826
00:53:39,063 --> 00:53:40,551
MARISHA: She said two shots. She wants two shots.

827
00:53:40,551 --> 00:53:41,872
TRAVIS: Oh, two shots?

828
00:53:41,872 --> 00:53:44,547
MARISHA: She wants two shots, and so wait, are me
and you doing the two and the--

829
00:53:44,547 --> 00:53:45,795
TRAVIS: That's ten shots.

830
00:53:45,795 --> 00:53:46,617
MARISHA: Quadruple?

831
00:53:46,617 --> 00:53:47,724
TRAVIS: Yeah, quad.

832
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,786
LAURA: This is the stupidest thing ever.

833
00:53:49,786 --> 00:53:52,461
TRAVIS: What? She wants to see the sunrise. She'll
totally be up for it.

834
00:53:52,461 --> 00:53:54,699
TALIESIN: Let it happen. We're all going to learn
a valuable lesson.

835
00:53:54,699 --> 00:53:58,222
TRAVIS: Yeah. It's amazing. I come back with ten
shots.

836
00:53:58,222 --> 00:54:02,711
MATT: All right, so who's drinking. One shot? Four
shots.

837
00:54:02,711 --> 00:54:04,334
LAURA: And she's getting two.

838
00:54:04,334 --> 00:54:05,939
TRAVIS: And two for Pike, so 11 shots.

839
00:54:05,939 --> 00:54:08,868
MATT: All right. I need constitution saving throws
from all four of you.

840
00:54:08,868 --> 00:54:11,021
TALIESIN: Do we get a constitution bonus from the
Heroes' Feast?

841
00:54:11,021 --> 00:54:13,026
MATT: Not a constitution bonus.

842
00:54:13,026 --> 00:54:14,655
TRAVIS: I don't want it, anyway.

843
00:54:14,655 --> 00:54:20,570
MARISHA: (laughs) Don't want it anyway. Oh, that's
not good.

844
00:54:20,570 --> 00:54:21,777
TALIESIN: Oh, wow!

845
00:54:21,777 --> 00:54:25,444
MARISHA: Eight. Total.

846
00:54:25,444 --> 00:54:26,846
TRAVIS: 14.

847
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:31,038
TALIESIN: 16.

848
00:54:31,038 --> 00:54:35,184
MATT: Pike, what'd you get?

849
00:54:35,184 --> 00:54:36,521
ASHLEY: 18.

850
00:54:36,521 --> 00:54:38,671
TALIESIN: 20. I'm so sorry, 20.

851
00:54:38,671 --> 00:54:44,329
MATT: Okay. So, Percy, you take your shot. It
burns down. You're fine. Pike, bam, bam. The

852
00:54:44,329 --> 00:54:49,452
little gnome takes it in her gut, grins, wipes the
edge of her chin, looks over to Grog with a bit of

853
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:53,666
a challenge look on her face. Grog, you look over
to Keyleth and both of you guys start slamming

854
00:54:53,666 --> 00:55:07,201
down the line. As you hit that fourth one, you can
feel the burn on the inside. You, a little bit of

855
00:55:07,201 --> 00:55:10,958
that Heroes' Feast begins to creep up, and you get
that acidic, you know--

856
00:55:10,958 --> 00:55:11,973
TRAVIS: Salsa?

857
00:55:11,973 --> 00:55:14,048
MATT: Have to stop a little bit, take it back
down, but you're good.

858
00:55:14,048 --> 00:55:15,561
TRAVIS: Little mild salsa?

859
00:55:15,561 --> 00:55:20,506
MATT: But you're good. You kick it back. As soon
as you open your eyes, you're like-- You look over

860
00:55:20,506 --> 00:55:28,560
across the way and all you see is Keyleth, her
expression go from a big smile, to neutral, to a

861
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:32,059
worried frown, looking to the door.

862
00:55:32,059 --> 00:55:33,956
SAM: She's going to-- She's going to take hit
points.

863
00:55:33,956 --> 00:55:38,421
MARISHA: I got to go outside. I got to go
outside.

864
00:55:38,421 --> 00:55:39,592
LAURA: I got her. I got her.

865
00:55:39,592 --> 00:55:41,376
MARISHA: I got to-- no, no, no, no.

866
00:55:41,376 --> 00:55:42,724
TRAVIS: No, she's got to stay!

867
00:55:42,724 --> 00:55:45,499
SAM: Vax! Vax! Hold her hair back! Hold her hair
back.

868
00:55:45,499 --> 00:55:47,648
TRAVIS: We should pick her up and carry her around
the bar.

869
00:55:47,648 --> 00:55:48,909
LAURA: Help her out.

870
00:55:48,909 --> 00:55:51,575
LIAM: I need to stay here.

871
00:55:51,575 --> 00:55:54,341
TRAVIS: (laughs) Come on, Keyleth!

872
00:55:54,341 --> 00:55:57,340
LAURA: I'll go help her out.

873
00:55:57,340 --> 00:55:59,373
TALIESIN: We've got her. We've got her.

874
00:55:59,373 --> 00:56:01,708
MATT: All right. What are you doing, Pike?

875
00:56:01,708 --> 00:56:08,434
ASHLEY: Wait. Okay, I want to help Keyleth out
because she's-- yeah. Go ahead, go ahead, go

876
00:56:08,434 --> 00:56:09,932
ahead. Hold on. Go ahead.

877
00:56:09,932 --> 00:56:11,256
MATT: Okay, so as you guys all--

878
00:56:11,256 --> 00:56:12,813
MARISHA: Pike, tell me a story!

879
00:56:12,813 --> 00:56:19,589
MATT: As you guys drag Keyleth outside-- Scanlan?
You're staying?

880
00:56:19,589 --> 00:56:21,389
SAM: I'm not going near that shit.

881
00:56:21,389 --> 00:56:24,863
MATT: All right. Vax is staying, and Pike? You're
staying?

882
00:56:24,863 --> 00:56:25,910
ASHLEY: Yeah.

883
00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:33,787
MATT: All right. As this is happening, Gilmore
sits up and begins to finish off his drink. "Ah,

884
00:56:33,787 --> 00:56:36,071
"it's good to see friends."

885
00:56:36,071 --> 00:56:37,863
SAM: You too, Gil.

886
00:56:37,863 --> 00:56:40,123
MATT: "Well."

887
00:56:40,123 --> 00:56:42,232
LIAM: You aren't going, are you?

888
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:46,410
MATT: "It's getting very late. I've only been back
a few days and I have a lot of business to attend

889
00:56:46,410 --> 00:56:47,910
"to in the morning."

890
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:52,256
LIAM: I'm sure you do. Could I borrow your ear for
a few minutes?

891
00:56:52,256 --> 00:56:55,697
MATT: "Certainly. It would be my absolute
pleasure."

892
00:56:55,697 --> 00:56:58,929
SAM: You want some privacy?

893
00:56:58,929 --> 00:57:00,312
LIAM: In private.

894
00:57:00,312 --> 00:57:05,486
MATT: "Oh. Far be me to stand in a way of a
private conversation."

895
00:57:05,486 --> 00:57:12,404
And he stands up for a second and walks over
to the far table in the corner, right by the stage

896
00:57:12,404 --> 00:57:17,421
where the harpist was playing but is no longer on
the stage. He sits down expectantly, waiting.

897
00:57:17,421 --> 00:57:20,445
LAURA: Can I watch this conversation from the
doorway?

898
00:57:20,445 --> 00:57:25,342
MATT: Well, if you guys are-- the doorway leads
into the textile portion, so if you guys aren't

899
00:57:25,342 --> 00:57:26,777
leaving the place entirely--

900
00:57:26,777 --> 00:57:31,345
MARISHA: Well, I figured we were just outside the
door.

901
00:57:31,345 --> 00:57:33,150
TALIESIN: If you want to hang by the textile, I've
taken her all the way out.

902
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:34,647
LAURA: I'm just going to hang out and watch in.

903
00:57:34,647 --> 00:57:36,876
MATT: Okay. Keyleth, make another constitution
saving throw.

904
00:57:36,876 --> 00:57:38,752
TALIESIN: This should be fun.

905
00:57:38,752 --> 00:57:44,253
MARISHA: No, that one cursed me before. That one
was bad. Let's do this one. Oh, that's better.

906
00:57:44,253 --> 00:57:47,278
That's better. 18.

907
00:57:47,278 --> 00:57:53,791
MATT: Okay, you do manage to make it all the way
outside of the building before you Druidcraft all

908
00:57:53,791 --> 00:57:54,717
over--

909
00:57:54,717 --> 00:57:56,706
(laughter)

910
00:57:56,706 --> 00:58:00,498
TALIESIN: All right, go! Oh, not on the jacket!

911
00:58:00,498 --> 00:58:03,428
LAURA: No, that looks terrible. That looks
terrible! Don't do that. Don't do that! That looks

912
00:58:03,428 --> 00:58:04,877
really bad.

913
00:58:04,877 --> 00:58:12,467
LIAM: Giffed for eternity. It's the internet, you
can't take it back. It's there forever.

914
00:58:12,467 --> 00:58:21,390
MATT: It's there forever. All the Percyleth
shippers now having a field day. All right, so.

915
00:58:21,390 --> 00:58:23,594
MARISHA: I'm so sorry.

916
00:58:23,594 --> 00:58:24,475
TALIESIN: It's okay.

917
00:58:24,475 --> 00:58:25,466
MARISHA: I'm so sorry.

918
00:58:25,466 --> 00:58:27,910
TALIESIN: I know. You'll be even sorrier in the
morning. It's all right.

919
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:30,569
MARISHA: Grog said it would make me stay up.

920
00:58:30,569 --> 00:58:32,342
TALIESIN: It's okay. It's okay.

921
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:37,886
MATT: As you sit down. "Yes, Vax'ildan, darling?"

922
00:58:37,886 --> 00:58:41,696
LIAM: We've known each other a long time.

923
00:58:41,696 --> 00:58:44,281
MATT: "Yeah."

924
00:58:44,281 --> 00:58:53,690
LIAM: Long time, yeah? And I have a lot of love
for you. You are an amazing man.

925
00:58:53,690 --> 00:58:56,696
MATT: "Well. Not disagreeing with you there."

926
00:58:56,696 --> 00:59:09,269
LIAM: That is part of your charm. I don't even
know what I'm saying. I feel I need to be honest

927
00:59:09,269 --> 00:59:16,059
with you. There's no question you and I have
danced around each other a bit in the past few

928
00:59:16,059 --> 00:59:22,591
years, and I have been curious.

929
00:59:22,591 --> 00:59:35,857
MATT: "Well. Curiosity is the spark of arcane
pursuits and knowledge. Among many other things."

930
00:59:35,857 --> 00:59:55,143
LIAM: I've come close many times to going further
than I have. You are a charming man. But I respect

931
00:59:55,143 --> 01:00:18,002
you very much. And I need to tell you that I can't
do the dance anymore. I am in love with someone I

932
01:00:18,002 --> 01:00:30,834
don't think loves me, but all the same, it
wouldn't be fair to you to think that we might

933
01:00:30,834 --> 01:00:36,402
dally, and I don't want to be a liar, so I won't
be.

934
01:00:36,402 --> 01:00:58,763
MATT: "Well, I certainly appreciate your honesty,
and, well, I would be lying if I didn't say I was

935
01:00:58,763 --> 01:01:06,657
"a little disappointed, but at the same time, the
heart wants what the heart wants, and I've enjoyed

936
01:01:06,657 --> 01:01:17,670
"our flirtation. Perhaps our paths aren't meant to
be quite so entwined. Such is the flow of fate, my friend."

937
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:30,056
(sighs) And he gives a little sigh of
digesting heartbreak a little bit, but, you know,

938
01:01:30,056 --> 01:01:37,332
there's a nod to him of understanding and
acceptance, and he looks up to you again with that

939
01:01:37,332 --> 01:01:47,726
whipcrack of a Gilmore smile and says, "I wish you
luck. The path of an uncertain heart is never an

940
01:01:47,726 --> 01:01:53,822
"easy one, and should you ever need an ear to bend
or a shoulder to cry on, well, you know where I

941
01:01:53,822 --> 01:01:57,726
"am, and if I'm not there, you know how to get hold
of me."

942
01:01:57,726 --> 01:02:08,375
LIAM: I reach out, hand behind his head, and I
say, you are a beautiful arcane bastard, and I

943
01:02:08,375 --> 01:02:11,036
kiss him full on the lips.

944
01:02:11,036 --> 01:02:14,890
LAURA: Vax getting all the kisses.

945
01:02:14,890 --> 01:02:19,969
LIAM: I pat him on the shoulder. Thank you.

946
01:02:19,969 --> 01:02:22,975
MATT: "Now you're just being a tease."

947
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:25,987
(laughter)

948
01:02:25,987 --> 01:02:34,886
MATT: He takes his cup, which is empty and holds
it up to the last drop. It puddles out. (sighs)

949
01:02:34,886 --> 01:02:37,471
"Good night to you, Vax'ildan."

950
01:02:37,471 --> 01:02:39,792
LIAM: Good night, Gil.

951
01:02:39,792 --> 01:02:46,384
MATT: Walks out into the night. As Gilmore walks
by you guys, he looks over at Keyleth and goes,

952
01:02:46,384 --> 01:02:48,513
"Get her some water."

953
01:02:48,513 --> 01:02:49,479
TALIESIN: Oh, yes.

954
01:02:49,479 --> 01:02:51,594
MARISHA: Why does my mouth keep producing saliva?

955
01:02:51,594 --> 01:02:56,094
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll get her water. I'll get her a
little jug of the firewater. It'll wash out her mouth.

956
01:02:56,094 --> 01:02:59,447
ASHLEY: Can I cast Lesser Restoration on her?

957
01:02:59,447 --> 01:03:00,843
MATT: You can.

958
01:03:00,843 --> 01:03:02,462
ASHLEY: All right, let's do it.

959
01:03:02,462 --> 01:03:05,728
LIAM: Cure alcohol poisoning?

960
01:03:05,728 --> 01:03:11,067
ASHLEY: Just to give her still a little bit of a
buzz. To just take the bad part out of it.

961
01:03:11,067 --> 01:03:14,639
MATT: A proper use of divine magic!

962
01:03:14,639 --> 01:03:18,498
TALIESIN: You can't divine the sad out of alcohol.
I don't think that works.

963
01:03:18,498 --> 01:03:22,245
LIAM: Can Pike follow us around all the time
everywhere for the rest of our days?

964
01:03:22,245 --> 01:03:23,979
MATT: Pike is the best wingman.

965
01:03:23,979 --> 01:03:28,049
MARISHA: Pike, Pike, I missed you so much.

966
01:03:28,049 --> 01:03:29,952
ASHLEY: Come here, come here.

967
01:03:29,952 --> 01:03:32,984
MARISHA: I'm sorry, you guys. I'm so sorry.

968
01:03:32,984 --> 01:03:40,496
MATT: Keyleth, as Pike embraces you, the warmth of
her hug is also matched with the warmth of the

969
01:03:40,496 --> 01:03:43,479
divine energy that briefly flows through your
body, and for a second you feel as if you're

970
01:03:43,479 --> 01:03:48,486
weightless, and the nausea is gone. The
drunkenness is still there, and the buzz is still

971
01:03:48,486 --> 01:03:51,979
finding its way through your system, but not as
heavy as it was before. You come a little more

972
01:03:51,979 --> 01:04:00,827
conscious of yourself, and when the warmth fades,
you feel much more in control of your current

973
01:04:00,827 --> 01:04:05,081
state of your mind, your well-being, and the
contents of your stomach.

974
01:04:05,081 --> 01:04:08,170
MARISHA: Holy shit. What kind of shots did you
give me, Grog?

975
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:13,022
TRAVIS: The weak stuff. Yeah. I think they call it
regret?

976
01:04:13,022 --> 01:04:15,043
SAM: Peach schnapps.

977
01:04:15,043 --> 01:04:17,631
LAURA: Goldschlager.

978
01:04:17,631 --> 01:04:24,923
TRAVIS: Goldschlager. Jaeger. Lemon citron vodka.

979
01:04:24,923 --> 01:04:29,083
MARISHA: (groans)

980
01:04:29,083 --> 01:04:31,474
ASHLEY: Oh man, I love this game.

981
01:04:31,474 --> 01:04:36,233
LAURA: Should we go home?

982
01:04:36,233 --> 01:04:40,970
SAM: Let's go home. We've left our mark here.

983
01:04:40,970 --> 01:04:48,154
TRAVIS: Does Keyleth lose the benefits of the
Heroes' Feast since she retched it all over the ground?

984
01:04:48,154 --> 01:04:49,459
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

985
01:04:49,459 --> 01:04:51,897
MARISHA: Why would you ask that question?

986
01:04:51,897 --> 01:04:54,286
TALIESIN: That's such a dick question to ask.

987
01:04:54,286 --> 01:04:59,205
MARISHA: My body absorbed the process and the
calories.

988
01:04:59,205 --> 01:05:03,791
MATT: It had been a few hours, or probably about
an hour since the initial feasting, so she's had

989
01:05:03,791 --> 01:05:10,101
enough to maintain the effect. But the gentleman
who owns the establishment is probably not going

990
01:05:10,101 --> 01:05:12,420
to be very happy in the morning when he has to
clean up.

991
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:15,493
MARISHA: I made it outside.

992
01:05:15,493 --> 01:05:16,926
LAURA: Kick some dirt over her puke.

993
01:05:16,926 --> 01:05:19,477
LIAM: It's just twigs and berries, anyway.

994
01:05:19,477 --> 01:05:27,559
MATT: You guys make your way back to Greyskull
Keep. As you approach the front gate of your

995
01:05:27,559 --> 01:05:37,356
establishment, you see Cordell and Shayne keeping
their evening watch over the gate. Cordell shouts

996
01:05:37,356 --> 01:05:42,192
down to the rest of you guys, "You've got guests
waiting for you!"

997
01:05:42,192 --> 01:05:43,648
LAURA and SAM: Oh, shit.

998
01:05:43,648 --> 01:05:45,681
LAURA: How long have they been here?

999
01:05:45,681 --> 01:05:55,123
MATT: He looks to Shayne. Shayne looks to him,
counts in her head. "I think probably at least two hours."

1000
01:05:55,123 --> 01:05:59,056
LAURA: (splutters) How many times have we told
you? Don't let guests in when we're not here!

1001
01:05:59,056 --> 01:06:01,352
MATT: "They had your permission."

1002
01:06:01,352 --> 01:06:03,053
LAURA: Oh, jeez. Who is it?

1003
01:06:03,053 --> 01:06:04,492
MATT: "Oh, it's a bunch of them."

1004
01:06:04,492 --> 01:06:07,425
SAM: Oh, it's my friends! This is why I wanted to
come home!

1005
01:06:07,425 --> 01:06:08,993
LAURA: Oh, Jesus.

1006
01:06:08,993 --> 01:06:14,602
MARISHA: The party keeps going! Cordell! Cordell,
open another bottle!

1007
01:06:14,602 --> 01:06:20,141
MATT: He looks over at Shayne, who goes, "Don't do
that, Cordell."

1008
01:06:20,141 --> 01:06:24,446
MARISHA: God damn it, Cordell, we pay you!

1009
01:06:24,446 --> 01:06:27,049
SAM: It's okay, ignore her. Let's go in.

1010
01:06:27,049 --> 01:06:34,968
MATT: The gate opens. You guys come inside, and
you find, as you enter the keep, the smell of a

1011
01:06:34,968 --> 01:06:41,480
recently cooked meal is permeating the air of the
keep. You hear laughter and a little bit of music

1012
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:42,529
in the distance.

1013
01:06:42,529 --> 01:06:43,923
LAURA: At least they're having fun.

1014
01:06:43,923 --> 01:06:50,868
MATT: And as you walk towards the eating chambers,
the central feasting area on the bottom floor of

1015
01:06:50,868 --> 01:06:56,170
your keep, there indeed you see your recently
discovered friends.

1016
01:06:56,170 --> 01:07:02,553
LAURA: Is that little-- is it a halfling teenager
that was picking pockets at the bar? Is he here?

1017
01:07:02,553 --> 01:07:04,245
MATT: He is, yes.

1018
01:07:04,245 --> 01:07:05,732
LAURA: Can I walk up to him?

1019
01:07:05,732 --> 01:07:12,251
MATT: Yes. Samson right now, by the way, is asleep
on a table. It's way past his bedtime. He's on the

1020
01:07:12,251 --> 01:07:13,751
edge there.

1021
01:07:13,751 --> 01:07:16,676
LAURA: I nudge him awake. Hey, Sticky Fingers.

1022
01:07:16,676 --> 01:07:19,054
MATT: "Hello, miss."

1023
01:07:19,054 --> 01:07:25,751
LAURA: Hey. So I saw you at the bar, getting
things off of people pockets. Off of people

1024
01:07:25,751 --> 01:07:26,734
pockets?

1025
01:07:26,734 --> 01:07:30,739
MATT: "They told me they wouldn't miss them."

1026
01:07:30,739 --> 01:07:34,974
LAURA: No, it's totally fine. I don't care. You
haven't done that here, have you?

1027
01:07:34,974 --> 01:07:36,425
MATT: "No."

1028
01:07:36,425 --> 01:07:37,443
LAURA: No.

1029
01:07:37,443 --> 01:07:41,599
MATT: "No, not unless he tells me to." And points
to Dr. Dranzel, who at this point has been like,

1030
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:43,871
"Scanlan! Finally." (chuckles)

1031
01:07:43,871 --> 01:07:45,700
SAM: Lovely to see you.

1032
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:48,727
MATT: You can see now, there's three bottles of
wine they've been drinking that are open and

1033
01:07:48,727 --> 01:07:49,597
about.

1034
01:07:49,597 --> 01:07:50,987
SAM: Did you bring those?

1035
01:07:50,987 --> 01:07:56,386
MATT: "No! But they were provided, and I'm not one
to not drink when it's not provided."

1036
01:07:56,386 --> 01:07:58,187
SAM: Well, thank you.

1037
01:07:58,187 --> 01:08:05,260
MARISHA: Oh, good. Cordell! Cordell, I'm sorry.
You opened wine, and I yelled at you. I'm sorry.

1038
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:07,493
MATT: Cordell's at the front gate.

1039
01:08:07,493 --> 01:08:09,416
MARISHA: Oh, I figured Cordell walked us in.

1040
01:08:09,416 --> 01:08:13,184
MATT: No, they're up on the front gate. Keyleth is
talking out to nothing.

1041
01:08:13,184 --> 01:08:15,895
MARISHA: Thanks, Cordell! Thank you!

1042
01:08:15,895 --> 01:08:20,106
MATT: The Lesser Restoration didn't have quite as
strong an effect on reversing the alcohol, but

1043
01:08:20,106 --> 01:08:22,067
she's not puking, so that's good.

1044
01:08:22,067 --> 01:08:24,417
MARISHA: I'm still drunk.

1045
01:08:24,417 --> 01:08:29,653
SAM: Doctor, thank you for coming over and
bringing the gang. It's so great to see you again

1046
01:08:29,653 --> 01:08:30,648
tonight.

1047
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:34,223
MATT: "Oh, you guys as well." You can see the rest
of the people are watching. Zed's fallen asleep.

1048
01:08:34,223 --> 01:08:37,525
Eselmyr's in the back corner, watching everyone.

1049
01:08:37,525 --> 01:08:38,806
SAM: Is that the singer?

1050
01:08:38,806 --> 01:08:45,042
MATT: Yeah, she's the older, mature elven woman
who's keeping an eye. Kaylie is there, sitting

1051
01:08:45,042 --> 01:08:53,789
next to Dranzel, and Kent Plucker has a lute he's
(musical note) on. "Well, come! Sit.

1052
01:08:53,789 --> 01:08:58,235
"Unless it's too late in the night, I have a
conversation I'd like to have."

1053
01:08:58,235 --> 01:09:00,915
SAM: Oh, please. Lay it on us. Anyone want to go
to bed?

1054
01:09:00,915 --> 01:09:02,095
MARISHA: No!

1055
01:09:02,095 --> 01:09:04,630
MATT: (chuckles) "I like her!"

1056
01:09:04,630 --> 01:09:06,227
TALIESIN: Yes, but let's do this anyway.

1057
01:09:06,227 --> 01:09:11,932
SAM: All right. Laina, bring around some meats!
Wait, we already ate.

1058
01:09:11,932 --> 01:09:13,980
LAURA: We already ate. We're fine. We're so full.

1059
01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:15,312
SAM: All right. Laina, go back to sleep.

1060
01:09:15,312 --> 01:09:21,503
MATT: (laughing) She looks tired. She's like,
(whimpering) "More meats? Okay. Is it all right if

1061
01:09:21,503 --> 01:09:22,667
"I go to bed?"

1062
01:09:22,667 --> 01:09:23,986
ALL: Yes.

1063
01:09:23,986 --> 01:09:31,004
MATT: "Sleep well. Glad you made it home safe."
She wanders back off, bags under her eyes. Dr.

1064
01:09:31,004 --> 01:09:37,361
Dranzel waves you all in. "So, that little
proposition that we talked about at the bar

1065
01:09:37,361 --> 01:09:40,821
"earlier today? The old man who didn't need his
fortune?"

1066
01:09:40,821 --> 01:09:42,062
MARISHA: Oh.

1067
01:09:42,062 --> 01:09:48,494
MATT: "Allow me to elaborate a bit in a more
private setting, if you don't mind."

1068
01:09:48,494 --> 01:09:50,460
LIAM: More private than our house?

1069
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:52,640
MATT: "This is the more private."

1070
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:56,083
LIAM: Ah. Cin-cin, everybody. Cin-cin.

1071
01:09:56,083 --> 01:09:59,292
SAM: Is that lipstick on your face, Vax?

1072
01:09:59,292 --> 01:10:07,548
LIAM: Maybe it is. I don't know where it would
have come from, though. This is a land of magic and

1073
01:10:07,548 --> 01:10:08,885
mystery. Who knows?

1074
01:10:08,885 --> 01:10:15,364
MATT: As Dranzel holds out his mug, he goes, "Now,
when we arrived to come play the Winter's Crest

1075
01:10:15,364 --> 01:10:23,506
"festival here in Emon, one of my contacts, we'll
say an old client of mine last year in Emon, right

1076
01:10:23,506 --> 01:10:30,958
"around the same time mentioned a peculiar thing.
Apparently, a wealthy lord here vanished about a

1077
01:10:30,958 --> 01:10:37,592
"year ago. His estate was sold to a private
collector. Apparently, this collector keeps his

1078
01:10:37,592 --> 01:10:42,389
"name off the books, and he couldn't really find
out any information about who he was or what his

1079
01:10:42,389 --> 01:10:49,308
"business is, but he acquired the entire estate.
People were curious as to what his business was,

1080
01:10:49,308 --> 01:10:53,218
"as the previous individual was rather well known
and the circumstances rather dubious in

1081
01:10:53,218 --> 01:11:00,004
"disappearance, but I don't know really how that
all went together. Anyway! This older collector

1082
01:11:00,004 --> 01:11:08,094
"was fairly active at this estate until a few
months ago. The windows have darkened and stayed

1083
01:11:08,094 --> 01:11:17,105
"as such. No furniture touched, the interior
elements unpacked or moved. Just went away. So I'm

1084
01:11:17,105 --> 01:11:25,922
"thinking either this fellow has kicked the final
bucket, met his end, or is off on some extended

1085
01:11:25,922 --> 01:11:36,814
"business trip, leaving his acquisition and all of
its contents ripe for the picking. Problem is, we

1086
01:11:36,814 --> 01:11:45,765
"can't get into the Cloudtop District. Kent and
Kaylie have tried numerous times. Almost got

1087
01:11:45,765 --> 01:11:52,523
"arrested." And you can see, Kaylie gives a nod
with her shoulders, shrugging. "Still got a few

1088
01:11:52,523 --> 01:11:53,994
"things to learn, apparently."

1089
01:11:53,994 --> 01:11:55,861
LAURA: Did you try winking?

1090
01:11:55,861 --> 01:12:03,497
MATT: "It's the first thing I threw out there,
dear." He goes back. "So, seeing as how you folks

1091
01:12:03,497 --> 01:12:11,963
"have got some pull in the town, I was thinking you
could either find a way to get us in quietly,

1092
01:12:11,963 --> 01:12:21,771
"carefully. Let us do our work, give us some tips
on the best way to stay out of sight. Or you could

1093
01:12:21,771 --> 01:12:30,619
"go in, grab a few things, come back here with the
spoils, and we'll take our cut." His eyes look

1094
01:12:30,619 --> 01:12:35,622
over to you. "I get the feeling that this kind of
work is not unfamiliar."

1095
01:12:35,622 --> 01:12:39,085
LAURA: It's certainly things we've done in the
past.

1096
01:12:39,085 --> 01:12:44,483
SAM: Didn't we discuss this and assume that this is a
house we'd been in once before?

1097
01:12:44,483 --> 01:12:50,868
LAURA: Are we talking about General Krieg's house,
or are we talking about the guy that we first came

1098
01:12:50,868 --> 01:12:53,448
into his house in Emon, remember? The diplomat.

1099
01:12:53,448 --> 01:12:55,109
TRAVIS: We don't know either way.

1100
01:12:55,109 --> 01:12:56,995
SAM: Do you know who used to reside there,
Doctor?

1101
01:12:56,995 --> 01:13:01,530
MATT: (sighs) "The name escapes me."

1102
01:13:01,530 --> 01:13:03,763
SAM: What about a position?

1103
01:13:03,763 --> 01:13:09,913
MATT: You do recall, the Cloudtop District was not
at your disposal when you first came here.

1104
01:13:09,913 --> 01:13:11,915
SAM: So this is a new place?

1105
01:13:11,915 --> 01:13:13,605
LAURA: It's probably General Krieg's place.

1106
01:13:13,605 --> 01:13:14,551
MATT: Possibly.

1107
01:13:14,551 --> 01:13:18,089
LAURA: Rage-looting.

1108
01:13:18,089 --> 01:13:20,296
MARISHA: Yeah, we found the lair.

1109
01:13:20,296 --> 01:13:22,058
TRAVIS: Down in the dungeon, there was the demon.

1110
01:13:22,058 --> 01:13:23,398
LIAM: Teleportation device.

1111
01:13:23,398 --> 01:13:25,124
LAURA: It could be a different house.

1112
01:13:25,124 --> 01:13:26,469
TALIESIN: This was a while ago.

1113
01:13:26,469 --> 01:13:29,248
LAURA: Does it sound like General Krieg's place?
Did you get a description of the place?

1114
01:13:29,248 --> 01:13:33,250
MATT: "Yes. Red brick building, iron fence
surrounding the outside--"

1115
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:34,355
LIAM: That's it.

1116
01:13:34,355 --> 01:13:35,791
LAURA: That's like every house, though.

1117
01:13:35,791 --> 01:13:41,386
MATT: Actually, no. Most of the houses there have
various colors. Krieg's was built more utilitarian

1118
01:13:41,386 --> 01:13:49,497
and was very minimalistic in its interior decor.
In fact, most of it seemed unused from what you

1119
01:13:49,497 --> 01:13:52,599
saw, other than the manservant that lived there.
The house, for the most part, the bedroom,

1120
01:13:52,599 --> 01:13:55,994
everything that you searched, seemed like it was
barely touched.

1121
01:13:55,994 --> 01:13:57,212
LAURA: Because he was a dragon.

1122
01:13:57,212 --> 01:13:58,619
TRAVIS: Yeah, he was a fucking dragon.

1123
01:13:58,619 --> 01:14:00,149
LAURA: Was that his house, that he's describing?

1124
01:14:00,149 --> 01:14:02,516
MATT: It seems pretty damn close to the
description that you recall.

1125
01:14:02,516 --> 01:14:09,280
LIAM: If we were to be interested, it's true that
you are pointing us in the direction of this

1126
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:13,139
place, but we would be doing all the work. We
would need a very high percentage.

1127
01:14:13,139 --> 01:14:20,899
MATT: "I'd previously discussed a 60-40 split."

1128
01:14:20,899 --> 01:14:24,457
LIAM: I know that's what you said. I said high.

1129
01:14:24,457 --> 01:14:27,667
MATT: "70-30."

1130
01:14:27,667 --> 01:14:34,544
LIAM: 80-20, or I'm not doing shit. You can send
him in.

1131
01:14:34,544 --> 01:14:36,406
SAM: Hey. This is my friend.

1132
01:14:36,406 --> 01:14:40,800
MATT: (sighs) "A tough bargain, but 80-20 it is."

1133
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:44,415
MATT and LIAM: (spitting noises)

1134
01:14:44,415 --> 01:14:45,635
MATT: "All righty."

1135
01:14:45,635 --> 01:14:47,883
LAURA: We haven't agreed to it.

1136
01:14:47,883 --> 01:14:49,350
MATT: "You just did!"

1137
01:14:49,350 --> 01:14:51,318
LAURA: We agreed to give you a cut if we go in.

1138
01:14:51,318 --> 01:14:53,886
MATT: "Fair enough."

1139
01:14:53,886 --> 01:15:03,116
LAURA: Here's the thing. If you haven't noticed,
we have a keep. An embassy. We're known around

1140
01:15:03,116 --> 01:15:07,288
town. We're council members. We can't go stealing
things from people's houses.

1141
01:15:07,288 --> 01:15:11,782
MATT: "Well, that's unfortunate. We'll have to
find somebody else."

1142
01:15:11,782 --> 01:15:20,145
TRAVIS: Well, hold on. He made a deal with you. If
he doesn't do it, we'll find somebody that will. He's

1143
01:15:20,145 --> 01:15:23,104
a man of his word, and we'll back it up. You don't
have to do it.

1144
01:15:23,104 --> 01:15:31,461
SAM: You know, Vex, we have sort of told the
sovereign that we are interested keenly in the

1145
01:15:31,461 --> 01:15:38,090
security of this area, and if this is an unsecured
house, we could just be going in to try to secure it.

1146
01:15:38,090 --> 01:15:39,347
TRAVIS: Excellent point.

1147
01:15:39,347 --> 01:15:42,183
MATT: "See? Thinking of the people. That's the
Scanlan Shorthalt I know."

1148
01:15:42,183 --> 01:15:45,710
TRAVIS: And remember, there were dangerous things
in that house. We can make sure that it's safe

1149
01:15:45,710 --> 01:15:48,434
now, protecting the, you know--

1150
01:15:48,434 --> 01:15:51,581
SAM: Yes. God forbid a child wanders in there.

1151
01:15:51,581 --> 01:15:52,814
TRAVIS: God forbid.

1152
01:15:52,814 --> 01:16:02,054
LIAM: We're not talking about breaking into a
living man's home. Krieg is gone. Krieg was a

1153
01:16:02,054 --> 01:16:03,203
dragon.

1154
01:16:03,203 --> 01:16:06,946
LAURA: And then it was obtained by somebody else,
who you don't know who it is.

1155
01:16:06,946 --> 01:16:09,015
MARISHA: Oh, are we talking about General Krieg?

1156
01:16:09,015 --> 01:16:11,500
LAURA: He was so dreamy. Do you remember him?

1157
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:13,187
MARISHA: He was so dreamy!

1158
01:16:13,187 --> 01:16:17,874
MATT: "Krieg. I've heard that name. I think that
may be the gentleman."

1159
01:16:17,874 --> 01:16:19,413
MARISHA: Oh, you know Krieg?

1160
01:16:19,413 --> 01:16:20,709
MATT: "Well, I don't know him."

1161
01:16:20,709 --> 01:16:25,280
TALIESIN: Perhaps we should at least take a look
to see if there was something else down there that

1162
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:27,500
was dangerous.

1163
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:30,522
TRAVIS: She said fine! I heard her. She said
fine.

1164
01:16:30,522 --> 01:16:34,096
SAM: Let's do this. Tomorrow, we'll set off to do
this. In the meantime, we invite you to stay at

1165
01:16:34,096 --> 01:16:36,666
our keep. Drink of our wine, eat of our food.

1166
01:16:36,666 --> 01:16:37,860
MARISHA: Yeah, more wine!

1167
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:39,291
SAM: Please, make yourselves at home.

1168
01:16:39,291 --> 01:16:44,050
MATT: "Is this not the greatest bard to have
lived?"

1169
01:16:44,050 --> 01:16:45,504
SAM: (chuckles) Yes.

1170
01:16:45,504 --> 01:16:46,859
TRAVIS: We think so.

1171
01:16:46,859 --> 01:16:48,407
SAM: Thank you.

1172
01:16:48,407 --> 01:16:52,498
MATT: "Scanlan, you humble us all. We're happy to
do so. And thank you very much for your fine

1173
01:16:52,498 --> 01:16:53,748
"hospitality."

1174
01:16:53,748 --> 01:16:55,585
TALIESIN: You humble us all by comparison.

1175
01:16:55,585 --> 01:17:01,455
LAURA: We have one room, in addition to what we
stay in. Would all of you be staying in the same

1176
01:17:01,455 --> 01:17:03,831
one, or would you want to stay in the temple?

1177
01:17:03,831 --> 01:17:05,357
SAM: We have a couple of rooms.

1178
01:17:05,357 --> 01:17:07,457
LIAM: We have a dungeon.

1179
01:17:07,457 --> 01:17:11,828
SAM: Our dragonborn room is available now, and as
well, we have a dungeon.

1180
01:17:11,828 --> 01:17:14,855
TRAVIS: I'll stay in the dungeon. They can stay in
my room.

1181
01:17:14,855 --> 01:17:18,872
SAM: I have a rather large bed, if Kaylie would
like to take that. I could sleep on the floor.

1182
01:17:18,872 --> 01:17:19,889
That's fine.

1183
01:17:19,889 --> 01:17:22,294
LAURA: You invited them to stay because you want
to bone Kaylie?

1184
01:17:22,294 --> 01:17:24,247
TRAVIS: What, are you really cock-blocking right
now?

1185
01:17:24,247 --> 01:17:25,627
LIAM: Did you just say that out loud?

1186
01:17:25,627 --> 01:17:27,238
TRAVIS: Are you cock-blocking in the keep?

1187
01:17:27,238 --> 01:17:32,729
MATT: As you're saying this, Kaylie is watching
this with a smirk on her face. "Well, I'm not one

1188
01:17:32,729 --> 01:17:34,703
"to turn down a soft bed for an evening."

1189
01:17:34,703 --> 01:17:36,544
TRAVIS: Yeah! Can't wreck that game!

1190
01:17:36,544 --> 01:17:42,209
(laughter)

1191
01:17:42,209 --> 01:17:48,143
MATT: Dranzel glances over. (laughs) "Good luck."

1192
01:17:48,143 --> 01:17:53,912
TALIESIN: We can also put some beds out in the
workshop which has now been vacated.

1193
01:17:53,958 --> 01:17:56,392
SAM: Grog, carry some beds around.

1194
01:17:56,392 --> 01:17:58,947
MARISHA: How long are you guys staying?

1195
01:17:58,947 --> 01:18:03,236
MATT: Zed sits up, the large, bearded gentleman.
He's like, "I'm happy to sleep here. This is fine

1196
01:18:03,236 --> 01:18:06,471
"by me. Just give me a flat surface." He goes over
to one of the tables and--

1197
01:18:06,471 --> 01:18:07,984
SAM: Is that Zed the drummer?

1198
01:18:07,984 --> 01:18:09,555
MATT: Yeah, he's the drummer.

1199
01:18:09,555 --> 01:18:10,675
SAM: Okay.

1200
01:18:10,675 --> 01:18:16,699
TRAVIS: Why don't you invite the little pickpocket
to sleep with you? So you can keep an eye on him.

1201
01:18:16,699 --> 01:18:19,131
So he doesn't steal stuff. Where are you going,
perv?

1202
01:18:19,131 --> 01:18:20,915
LAURA: Where are you going, perv?

1203
01:18:20,915 --> 01:18:23,298
(laughter)

1204
01:18:23,298 --> 01:18:25,745
SAM: Let's all turn in, shall we?

1205
01:18:25,745 --> 01:18:29,627
TRAVIS: Let's turn in!

1206
01:18:29,627 --> 01:18:30,856
MATT: All right.

1207
01:18:30,856 --> 01:18:35,038
LAURA: I'm going to stay up and keep an eye on the
doors when they go into their rooms and make sure

1208
01:18:35,038 --> 01:18:37,436
they actually stay-- actually, no, I'm going to go
find Jareth.

1209
01:18:37,436 --> 01:18:39,602
MATT: Jarett, you mean?

1210
01:18:39,602 --> 01:18:40,652
LAURA: Jarett.

1211
01:18:40,652 --> 01:18:41,862
MATT: It's been that week.

1212
01:18:41,862 --> 01:18:43,339
ALL: Aw.

1213
01:18:43,339 --> 01:18:48,809
TALIESIN: I shove Keyleth into her room.

1214
01:18:48,809 --> 01:18:51,648
MARISHA: (slurred) Good night, Percy.

1215
01:18:51,648 --> 01:18:53,012
TALIESIN: Good night.

1216
01:18:53,012 --> 01:18:59,346
MATT: You guys all find your way to your rooms.
You arrange beds for those who need it, for the

1217
01:18:59,346 --> 01:19:05,939
most part down in the dungeon area. A couple of
rooms are crowded with other folks, except for

1218
01:19:05,939 --> 01:19:09,460
Kaylie, who is following you, Scanlan, with a
bottle of wine and two glasses.

1219
01:19:09,460 --> 01:19:10,560
LAURA: Oh my.

1220
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:11,576
LIAM: Oh dear.

1221
01:19:11,576 --> 01:19:13,570
LAURA: She's going to rob you blind.

1222
01:19:13,570 --> 01:19:25,418
MATT: As you all go to your various rooms, Kaylie
pulls out the chair and the table at the far end

1223
01:19:25,418 --> 01:19:30,532
of your bedroom. Sets down and begins to pour
glasses of wine and sits across. You guys have

1224
01:19:30,532 --> 01:19:33,827
drinks and begin various conversations about--

1225
01:19:33,827 --> 01:19:35,534
(flute music)

1226
01:19:35,534 --> 01:19:37,582
(laughter)

1227
01:19:37,582 --> 01:19:46,601
MATT: She's that good of a flute player. She asks
you about your history and your travels and how

1228
01:19:46,601 --> 01:19:48,224
you met Dr. Dranzel, and everything.

1229
01:19:48,224 --> 01:19:51,061
SAM: I tell her all the best parts, and leave out
the naughty bits.

1230
01:19:51,061 --> 01:19:54,482
MATT: "Interesting tale."

1231
01:19:54,482 --> 01:19:55,622
SAM: Kingslayer.

1232
01:19:55,622 --> 01:19:57,478
MATT: "Right, right."

1233
01:19:57,478 --> 01:19:58,665
SAM: Leader of the rebellion.

1234
01:19:58,718 --> 01:20:01,377
MATT: "So you've said, a number of times,
aye."

1235
01:20:01,377 --> 01:20:06,639
She drinks a little bit more of the wine, sets
it down. "I guess I should tell you a bit

1236
01:20:06,639 --> 01:20:08,528
"more about myself, then."

1237
01:20:08,528 --> 01:20:09,940
SAM: Yes, please, I'm fascinated.

1238
01:20:09,940 --> 01:20:15,476
MATT: "Well, I grew up in Kymal, mostly, before
moving to Westrunn to train at the College of the

1239
01:20:15,476 --> 01:20:18,330
"White Duke. Finest of the bards, he was."

1240
01:20:18,330 --> 01:20:19,644
SAM: Yes, yes he--

1241
01:20:19,644 --> 01:20:24,494
MATT: "My mom gave all her savings to put me up
there. Now, I only joined the troop about six

1242
01:20:24,494 --> 01:20:28,759
"months back. It was my third year at the Duke's
when the good doctor came through and, well, I

1243
01:20:28,759 --> 01:20:36,223
"seized the opportunity. Now, to be perfectly
honest up-front, I've already heard a bit about

1244
01:20:36,223 --> 01:20:42,927
"your tales, Shorthalt. (chuckles) The Charming of
the Pauper Prince, your rendition of the Summer

1245
01:20:42,927 --> 01:20:48,351
"Sunder, the Cliffs of Dagger Bay. I've been hoping
our paths would cross."

1246
01:20:48,351 --> 01:20:50,202
MARISHA: (laughing) Wait--

1247
01:20:50,202 --> 01:20:53,790
TRAVIS: You're not there, Drunky.

1248
01:20:53,790 --> 01:20:55,818
LAURA: You're drunk, go to sleep.

1249
01:20:55,818 --> 01:21:00,049
MARISHA: (wheezing) Cliffs of Dagger Bay! Go
ahead!

1250
01:21:00,049 --> 01:21:01,666
MATT: Dagger Bay's just a place.

1251
01:21:01,666 --> 01:21:02,675
MARISHA: Yeah?

1252
01:21:02,675 --> 01:21:03,901
(laughter)

1253
01:21:03,901 --> 01:21:04,989
MARISHA: Go ahead.

1254
01:21:04,989 --> 01:21:07,674
LAURA: (laughing) What?

1255
01:21:07,674 --> 01:21:13,912
SAM: Well, I'm flattered, and, you have quite
talent for-- quite a lot of talent for just been

1256
01:21:13,912 --> 01:21:17,217
playing with the troop for six months. I was
impressed by that.

1257
01:21:17,217 --> 01:21:25,861
MATT: "Thank you very much. You know where I've
heard most of these stories?

1258
01:21:25,861 --> 01:21:28,869
"My mother, Sybil."

1259
01:21:28,869 --> 01:21:30,599
SAM: Who?

1260
01:21:30,599 --> 01:21:36,892
MATT: "Sybil. A fine gnomish lass, it was some
years ago, she came across a smooth,

1261
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:43,595
"silver-tongued flautist who blew through like the
wind and disappeared."

1262
01:21:43,595 --> 01:21:44,939
(gasping)

1263
01:21:44,939 --> 01:21:48,290
MATT: "Took her innocence with a promise, then
vanished just as suddenly. Left her a child to

1264
01:21:48,290 --> 01:21:54,281
"raise on the income of a quilter, she did. Now
growing up, I heard tale and tale of your musical

1265
01:21:54,281 --> 01:22:01,001
"feats as my mother took on a third job to support
us through bad harvests, just south of Silvercut.

1266
01:22:01,001 --> 01:22:07,529
"Being the only tiny, female fair folk in such a
rural town means being preyed upon, so

1267
01:22:07,529 --> 01:22:14,673
"I learned to use a blade quickly, and to wield my
charm just as viciously. Seems that runs in the

1268
01:22:14,673 --> 01:22:16,188
"family, aye?"

1269
01:22:16,188 --> 01:22:18,251
SAM: I-- oh, I--

1270
01:22:18,251 --> 01:22:19,505
(laughter)

1271
01:22:19,505 --> 01:22:25,385
MATT: "I practiced. I stole. Lied about my age and
eventually paid my way into the Duke's College so

1272
01:22:25,385 --> 01:22:33,214
"I could find you. Prove you a scoundrel." At this
point, you see her stand up, and she begins to draw

1273
01:22:33,214 --> 01:22:35,502
a small blade from her side.

1274
01:22:35,502 --> 01:22:36,821
SAM: She's going to fight me!

1275
01:22:36,821 --> 01:22:38,041
MARISHA: Oh my god!

1276
01:22:38,041 --> 01:22:41,331
MATT: Her face is hardened and still as she stares
at you. You see a slight tremble in her hand.

1277
01:22:41,331 --> 01:22:51,018
"This day, Scanlan Shorthalt, I beat you at your
own song. Now I come to take your dignity. Now

1278
01:22:51,018 --> 01:22:52,405
"take up your sword."

1279
01:22:52,405 --> 01:22:53,970
TRAVIS: (whispering) Holy shit--

1280
01:22:53,970 --> 01:22:59,038
SAM: First of all, Kaylie, it's so wonderful to
meet you.

1281
01:22:59,038 --> 01:23:00,953
MATT: "Don't try that with me."

1282
01:23:00,953 --> 01:23:10,847
SAM: I didn't know! Listen, I have my faults, for sure,
but (stammers) I didn't know that you existed! I

1283
01:23:10,847 --> 01:23:15,025
would have, I would have come to visit, I would
have come to meet you-- how can you fault me for

1284
01:23:15,025 --> 01:23:17,245
something that I did not know about?

1285
01:23:17,245 --> 01:23:19,738
MATT: "Do you even remember Sybil?"

1286
01:23:19,738 --> 01:23:23,868
SAM: I mean, could you describe her a little more
detailed?

1287
01:23:23,868 --> 01:23:26,628
(laughter)

1288
01:23:26,628 --> 01:23:33,960
MATT: Make a wisdom check. Roll a d20, add your
wisdom modifier.

1289
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:40,469
SAM: Okay, wisdom? Which is a negative two. 16.

1290
01:23:40,469 --> 01:23:51,595
MATT: 16. You vaguely recall Sybil. She-- golden
hair, very eager to escape her simple beginnings,

1291
01:23:51,595 --> 01:23:56,026
and very clingy very quickly. You jumped out of
there very fast, from your perspective.

1292
01:23:56,026 --> 01:24:03,225
SAM: Ah yes, Sybil. She was passionate,
intelligent--

1293
01:24:03,225 --> 01:24:08,643
(laughter)

1294
01:24:08,643 --> 01:24:18,719
SAM: She really, lot of-- hands-y, sort of, I mean, I
think I remember her quite well. And she was a

1295
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:25,401
wonderful person, and you should be honored to
have such a wonderful person as your parent, and

1296
01:24:25,401 --> 01:24:29,758
not someone like me, because I was a scoundrel,
you're right.

1297
01:24:29,758 --> 01:24:31,985
MATT: "You are a scoundrel."

1298
01:24:31,985 --> 01:24:36,656
SAM: I have been, in past moments in my life, a
scoundrel, I've--

1299
01:24:36,656 --> 01:24:40,043
MATT: "Do you even realize you nearly invited your
daughter up to sleep with you?"

1300
01:24:40,043 --> 01:24:44,928
(laughter)

1301
01:24:44,928 --> 01:24:46,486
SAM: I mean...

1302
01:24:46,486 --> 01:24:47,632
MATT: "You don't care."

1303
01:24:47,632 --> 01:24:50,053
SAM: I feel like I wouldn't have let it go that
far? I--

1304
01:24:50,053 --> 01:25:01,940
MATT: "You have no boundaries. You take what you
like and you keep walking on. You trick folk. Now

1305
01:25:01,940 --> 01:25:04,231
"draw your blade."

1306
01:25:04,231 --> 01:25:10,687
SAM: I don't want to fight you, if that's what
you're insinuating. Listen, I know that I've made

1307
01:25:10,687 --> 01:25:19,850
mistakes in my life. I've admitted as much before,
and I don't know why I'm this way. I must need to

1308
01:25:19,850 --> 01:25:24,416
do a lot of soul-searching to come up with an
answer, but there is a woman who I love very

1309
01:25:24,416 --> 01:25:28,888
dearly and who I would do anything for, and I'm
trying to be a better person. I haven't been to a

1310
01:25:28,888 --> 01:25:38,015
whorehouse in months! That's a big step for me. A
bit step. I know that sounds callous and crude,

1311
01:25:38,015 --> 01:25:48,090
but I've tried to be a better person. If you're
here to fight me, I'm afraid you're going to be

1312
01:25:48,090 --> 01:25:54,828
terribly disappointed, because I will just let you
kill me, if that's what it takes. I didn't know

1313
01:25:54,828 --> 01:26:01,609
you existed, and my heart is breaking a hundred
times now for not knowing it. Every year that

1314
01:26:01,609 --> 01:26:07,281
you've been alive is a year I could have been a
better person and known someone who could have

1315
01:26:07,281 --> 01:26:14,216
made me a better person, and I'm only sorry that I
didn't know it. If there's anything I can do

1316
01:26:14,216 --> 01:26:22,714
for you from now on-- if you are truly my blood, I
will, because among my many faults, ego is

1317
01:26:22,714 --> 01:26:26,778
certainly one of them, and knowing you're part of
me makes me love you even more.

1318
01:26:26,778 --> 01:26:30,186
(laughter)

1319
01:26:30,186 --> 01:26:33,571
MATT: Make a persuasion check. With advantage, for
that speech.

1320
01:26:33,571 --> 01:26:35,240
SAM: Persuasion?

1321
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:36,406
LIAM: With advantage!

1322
01:26:36,406 --> 01:26:37,677
SAM: It won't matter.

1323
01:26:37,677 --> 01:26:39,910
MARISHA: Is there a manipulation check?

1324
01:26:39,910 --> 01:26:42,116
SAM: 32.

1325
01:26:42,116 --> 01:26:46,982
TRAVIS: No shit, it won't matter.

1326
01:26:46,982 --> 01:26:48,834
LAURA: Oh? She rolled high, too.

1327
01:26:48,834 --> 01:26:50,138
SAM: Oh, shit. She's big.

1328
01:26:50,138 --> 01:26:51,497
MARISHA: A bard.

1329
01:26:51,497 --> 01:26:56,606
MATT: As she stands there with her blade out,
staring at you, you can see the veins in her neck

1330
01:26:56,606 --> 01:26:57,924
tensing.

1331
01:26:57,924 --> 01:27:06,383
SAM: I slowly unbutton my shirt and show her my
chest and say, "Stab me right here, if you'd like,

1332
01:27:06,383 --> 01:27:12,060
"and I will not resist. You've earned it. Take
me."

1333
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:18,741
MATT: You see the tear begin to roll down her
cheek as her jaw clenches.

1334
01:27:18,741 --> 01:27:22,395
(grunts) And she thrusts forward--

1335
01:27:22,395 --> 01:27:24,070
-- and rolls a natural one.

1336
01:27:24,070 --> 01:27:25,265
SAM: A natural one?

1337
01:27:25,265 --> 01:27:26,480
LAURA: Aw, a natural one.

1338
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:32,532
MATT: As she goes to strike towards you, even in
that moment, her will falters and the blade falls

1339
01:27:32,532 --> 01:27:39,664
limp. It hits your chest, and you feel the
piercing of something pushing into your flesh, but

1340
01:27:39,664 --> 01:27:44,959
no more than maybe half an inch, as there's no
real force behind the blade. As the hand releases

1341
01:27:44,959 --> 01:27:52,666
her weapon, it clatters to the ground as her
momentum carries her arms around your shoulders.

1342
01:27:52,666 --> 01:27:54,968
ALL: Oh!

1343
01:27:54,968 --> 01:28:02,505
MATT: As she holds you there, her tousled, short
pixie brown hair, you can feel the wetness across

1344
01:28:02,505 --> 01:28:10,436
the back of your neck, and you hear her voice
trembling in your ear say, "Why? Why can't I do

1345
01:28:10,436 --> 01:28:16,014
"it? All the years building up to this and I have
the chance, and I can't do it."

1346
01:28:16,014 --> 01:28:24,485
SAM: I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry that
you're going through this, and I'm more sorry that

1347
01:28:24,485 --> 01:28:35,757
you're going through this by yourself, but I think
deep down you're a Shorthalt, and there's

1348
01:28:35,757 --> 01:28:43,918
something that you have that's connected to me and
I to you, and perhaps I misread that as some sort

1349
01:28:43,918 --> 01:28:51,438
of-- ugh-- icky attraction, and I apologize, but
I've known for a while now that something is

1350
01:28:51,438 --> 01:28:58,378
missing in my life, some sort of focus, and some
sort of moral compass. Maybe it's just arrived at

1351
01:28:58,378 --> 01:29:00,394
my doorstep?

1352
01:29:00,394 --> 01:29:08,554
MATT: You say that and her arms tense for a
minute, involuntary, trying to pull you closer,

1353
01:29:08,554 --> 01:29:15,970
then they relax, and she steps away, averting her
gaze, keeping her head down. She bends down and

1354
01:29:15,970 --> 01:29:23,220
picks up her blade. Doesn't sheathe it, just holds
it limply at her side. She begins to walk to the

1355
01:29:23,220 --> 01:29:32,019
door. She opens the door and looks back at you,
her eyes finally meeting yours. You can see the

1356
01:29:32,019 --> 01:29:42,965
wet stains across her cheeks. "You're still a
scoundrel. It's what's kept you alive this long.

1357
01:29:42,965 --> 01:29:56,407
"In some ways, it's what's kept me alive this long. I've
got a lot to think about. I'm going to go for a

1358
01:29:56,407 --> 01:30:02,554
"walk. (sighs) I need some fresh air." And she
closes the door behind her.

1359
01:30:02,554 --> 01:30:10,973
SAM: I sit for a moment and think about
everything, try to remember more about Sybil.

1360
01:30:10,973 --> 01:30:18,612
MATT: There's a lot of faces blurring, this is--
You worked your way through a lot of Tal'Dorei in

1361
01:30:18,612 --> 01:30:20,083
those days, you--

1362
01:30:20,083 --> 01:30:30,354
SAM: Yes. She was, she was. Yes, I think, yeah.
She wasn't that giant. No, she was. Okay. And I

1363
01:30:30,354 --> 01:30:35,192
have a very restless night thinking about
everything.

1364
01:30:35,192 --> 01:30:40,212
MATT: Okay. And with that, we're going to go ahead
and take a bathroom break. We'll be back here in

1365
01:30:40,212 --> 01:30:42,638
five minutes.

1366
01:30:42,638 --> 01:30:43,909
LIAM: Amazing, amazing!

1367
01:30:43,909 --> 01:30:45,093
MARISHA: So good! You.

1368
01:30:45,093 --> 01:30:48,892
MATT: You avoided a showdown in your bedroom.

1369
01:30:48,892 --> 01:30:51,146
SAM: With my daughter!

1370
01:30:51,146 --> 01:30:57,676
MATT: She was ready to. We'll be back here real
fast, take this, a quick break, quick as we can,

1371
01:30:57,676 --> 01:31:00,949
because we have a lot to get through before we get
to Critmas. We'll see you here in just a few

1372
01:31:00,949 --> 01:31:01,945
minutes.

1373
01:31:01,945 --> 01:31:02,980
TALIESIN: Damn!

1374
01:31:02,980 --> 01:31:04,178
LAURA: That was awesome.

1375
01:31:04,178 --> 01:43:28,553
[break]

1376
01:43:28,553 --> 01:43:29,926
TRAVIS: Balls.

1377
01:43:29,926 --> 01:43:34,093
MATT: Welcome back, everyone. So before we get
back into this crazy little Maury Povich show

1378
01:43:34,093 --> 01:43:40,749
episode, we have a chatroom winner for our
giveaway, which is awesome. Congratulations to

1379
01:43:40,749 --> 01:43:48,533
dr3vvn45ty, you are our winner for this evening's
chat room giveaway, congratulations!

1380
01:43:48,533 --> 01:43:50,535
(cheering)

1381
01:43:50,535 --> 01:43:55,354
MATT: You're going to get awesome art and a cool
package of games and stuff, it'll be really

1382
01:43:55,354 --> 01:44:05,158
awesome, so congrats. All right, so. Jumping back
in. The morning comes around, consciousness comes

1383
01:44:05,158 --> 01:44:06,896
to all of you, you--

1384
01:44:06,896 --> 01:44:10,301
LAURA: I had, in the night I had gone to find
Jarett.

1385
01:44:10,301 --> 01:44:11,681
MATT: Oh right, Jarett, sorry.

1386
01:44:11,681 --> 01:44:16,228
LAURA: Just to tell him to keep an eye on the
rooms and everything. Because, you know, I'm sure

1387
01:44:16,228 --> 01:44:21,707
they're all great people, but-- I know they have
some shady practices, so. I just want to make sure that--

1388
01:44:21,707 --> 01:44:23,709
SAM: That's my daughter you're talking about, by
the way.

1389
01:44:23,709 --> 01:44:25,345
TRAVIS: We don't know that yet.

1390
01:44:25,345 --> 01:44:28,425
MATT: "I'm happy to take care of this for you." He
loads his crossbow and plops himself down at the

1391
01:44:28,425 --> 01:44:32,023
edge of the hall where he has a view of every
single door at the south end of the keep. And he's,

1392
01:44:32,023 --> 01:44:38,778
like, perched and ready. All right. You guys come
to consciousness the next morning, more hungover

1393
01:44:38,778 --> 01:44:46,254
than others, depending on the individual. Come
down, breakfast has already been prepared and

1394
01:44:46,254 --> 01:44:52,084
waiting. (laughs) Poor Laina's been trying to keep
it warm for you, and part of it's already being

1395
01:44:52,084 --> 01:44:58,123
eaten by your guests, who, half of them fell
asleep in the actual dining room. Nevertheless,

1396
01:44:58,123 --> 01:45:05,620
all of you come down. Scanlan, you eventually come
out of your confused reverie. Not a lot of good

1397
01:45:05,620 --> 01:45:10,984
sleep throughout the evening and Kaylie never came
back throughout the night.

1398
01:45:10,984 --> 01:45:15,316
SAM: Mm. Is Dr. Dranzel around?

1399
01:45:15,316 --> 01:45:19,897
MATT: Yeah. As you head down to the main dining
area, Dranzel is there and he's a little hungover

1400
01:45:19,897 --> 01:45:25,100
himself and enjoying the remnants of his meal.
Poor Laina is not designed to produce breakfast

1401
01:45:25,100 --> 01:45:27,339
for over 11 people in a morning.

1402
01:45:27,339 --> 01:45:31,493
SAM: Old friend, a quick word.

1403
01:45:31,493 --> 01:45:33,571
MATT: "Yes. Good morning, Scanlan."

1404
01:45:33,571 --> 01:45:37,520
SAM: Good morning-- Well, morning to you as well.
Did you know?

1405
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:39,816
MATT: "About?"

1406
01:45:39,816 --> 01:45:43,400
SAM: Did you know? About the girl?

1407
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:47,242
MATT: "What did she do?"

1408
01:45:47,242 --> 01:45:48,746
SAM: All right.

1409
01:45:48,746 --> 01:45:55,165
MATT: "What did she do?" And you can see, he looks
a little worried now. He's checking his pockets.

1410
01:45:55,165 --> 01:45:59,071
SAM: Does he seem-- Can I insight check him?

1411
01:45:59,071 --> 01:46:00,241
MATT: Yeah, make an insight check.

1412
01:46:00,241 --> 01:46:02,386
SAM: Does he seem genuine? Oh, boy.

1413
01:46:02,386 --> 01:46:04,773
(laughter)

1414
01:46:04,773 --> 01:46:06,059
SAM: Three.

1415
01:46:06,059 --> 01:46:13,986
MATT: Three. Seems pretty genuine. Yeah, he's hard
to read beyond hung over and mildly confused. And

1416
01:46:13,986 --> 01:46:18,120
you spent a lot of time with him, so you know his
demeanor pretty well. But yeah, he seems genuinely

1417
01:46:18,120 --> 01:46:23,127
like (stutters) "If she's done anything wrong, let
me know. She's part of my troupe. I take

1418
01:46:23,127 --> 01:46:24,699
"responsibility for her."

1419
01:46:24,699 --> 01:46:28,221
SAM: No, no. She's a fine player and a fine,
upstanding person, and you should take special

1420
01:46:28,221 --> 01:46:37,975
interest in her. She's a good one. Please, if she
continues on with your troupe, take good care of

1421
01:46:37,975 --> 01:46:39,326
her, all right?

1422
01:46:39,326 --> 01:46:49,725
MATT: "Of course. As long as she keeps bringing in
the change and doesn't piss me off, I think we're good."

1423
01:46:49,725 --> 01:46:52,620
SAM: She might. All right.

1424
01:46:52,620 --> 01:46:56,093
MATT: Takes his hat and puts it on, finishes his
breakfast.

1425
01:46:56,093 --> 01:47:01,142
LAURA: Can I check around? Look around the keep
and make sure-- I mean in the general area and see

1426
01:47:01,142 --> 01:47:02,251
if anything's missing?

1427
01:47:02,251 --> 01:47:03,194
TRAVIS: So paranoid.

1428
01:47:03,194 --> 01:47:05,368
LAURA: Seriously, I do not trust these people.

1429
01:47:05,368 --> 01:47:06,526
SAM: Where's our five-thou?

1430
01:47:06,526 --> 01:47:09,300
LAURA: Yeah, where is our five-thou? Did it get
delivered?

1431
01:47:09,300 --> 01:47:11,086
MATT: It never got delivered.

1432
01:47:11,086 --> 01:47:13,772
LIAM: Oh shit.

1433
01:47:13,772 --> 01:47:15,941
MATT: I mean, who are you asking?

1434
01:47:15,941 --> 01:47:22,206
LAURA: I'm asking the guards at the front if
anybody came from the keep, from Uriel.

1435
01:47:22,206 --> 01:47:31,873
MATT: Okay. Cordell and Shayne are now changing
over into the next morning staff. As they're

1436
01:47:31,873 --> 01:47:36,607
getting their stuff together, the morning staff
would be Kendrick--

1437
01:47:36,607 --> 01:47:38,025
SAM: Natibe?

1438
01:47:38,025 --> 01:47:41,131
MATT: -- and Natibe, yes. You took notes.

1439
01:47:41,131 --> 01:47:43,834
SAM: I wrote them down, it's not a big deal.

1440
01:47:43,834 --> 01:47:46,603
LIAM: You pulled a rabbit out of a hat.

1441
01:47:46,603 --> 01:47:53,146
MATT: But yeah, as they're changing over, you walk
over and ask them. And Shayne goes, "Yeah, no, we

1442
01:47:53,146 --> 01:47:57,513
"had a messenger come by and drop something off for
you guys."

1443
01:47:57,513 --> 01:47:58,867
LAURA: Where is it?

1444
01:47:58,867 --> 01:48:03,395
MATT: "Well, we gave it to Erwen and he brought it
inside, but you guys weren't home."

1445
01:48:03,395 --> 01:48:06,753
LAURA: What did it look like?

1446
01:48:06,753 --> 01:48:10,912
MATT: "A small wooden thing, right?"

1447
01:48:10,912 --> 01:48:12,345
LAURA: Where did Erwen put it?

1448
01:48:12,345 --> 01:48:14,521
MATT: Cordell's like, "Yeah, it was like a small
wooden case."

1449
01:48:14,521 --> 01:48:16,098
LAURA: Where did you put it? Where did you put
it?

1450
01:48:16,098 --> 01:48:20,129
MATT: "Erwen took it in."

1451
01:48:20,129 --> 01:48:21,061
LAURA: Where's Erwen?

1452
01:48:21,061 --> 01:48:25,380
MATT: They both look at each other. "Look, our
shift's over."

1453
01:48:25,380 --> 01:48:27,019
LAURA: Just tell me where the fuck Erwen is.

1454
01:48:27,019 --> 01:48:31,344
MATT: "Probably inside the keep! I don't watch
your little old man-servant. I'm sorry. I'm

1455
01:48:31,344 --> 01:48:32,938
"supposed to watch the front of the gate."

1456
01:48:32,938 --> 01:48:34,777
LAURA: Fuck. I go inside to find Erwen.

1457
01:48:34,777 --> 01:48:39,495
MATT: Okay. Erwen, who's dressed up in his proper
servant attire now that he has to entertain

1458
01:48:39,495 --> 01:48:52,477
guests. His hair is slicked back and is a scoop of
a balding male dome. "Yes, Vex'ahlia. May I be of

1459
01:48:52,477 --> 01:48:53,933
"service to you this morning?"

1460
01:48:53,933 --> 01:48:55,320
LAURA: You look wonderful today.

1461
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:56,560
MATT: "Oh, you."

1462
01:48:56,560 --> 01:49:00,329
LAURA: Box, box, box, where did it go, box? The
box that came last night.

1463
01:49:00,329 --> 01:49:04,109
MATT: "Oh! Oh yes! No, there was a delivery."

1464
01:49:04,109 --> 01:49:05,377
LAURA: Yes.

1465
01:49:05,377 --> 01:49:15,523
MATT: "I was looking for you all, but no one was
home. So I asked around if anyone had seen you and

1466
01:49:15,523 --> 01:49:20,818
"your guests said that you would be coming and that
they would hold it for you until you arrived."

1467
01:49:20,818 --> 01:49:21,950
LAURA: Our guests did?

1468
01:49:21,950 --> 01:49:23,421
SAM: (laughing) Shit.

1469
01:49:23,421 --> 01:49:28,447
LAURA: Our guests did? I go storming into the
breakfast area. Dr. Dre!

1470
01:49:28,447 --> 01:49:30,501
SAM: Dra.

1471
01:49:30,501 --> 01:49:34,525
LAURA: Dr. Dra. Hey!

1472
01:49:34,525 --> 01:49:38,444
MATT: He's stood up and put his hat on. "Ah,
yes!"

1473
01:49:38,444 --> 01:49:44,849
LAURA: Yes. You had the best night's sleep here, I
bet? So comfortable? Lots of wine? That box, give

1474
01:49:44,849 --> 01:49:46,578
it to me now.

1475
01:49:46,578 --> 01:49:53,433
MATT: "Oh! (laughs) Yes, we were making sure that
it wasn't pilfered by any untrustworthy types. Of

1476
01:49:53,433 --> 01:49:54,361
"course, of course."

1477
01:49:54,361 --> 01:49:55,400
LAURA: That's so kind of you.

1478
01:49:55,400 --> 01:49:59,427
MATT: "We're more than happy to help. You being
such fine hosts to us, it's the least we could

1479
01:49:59,427 --> 01:50:07,807
"do." And he leans over to Kent. (murmurs
something) You can read lips.

1480
01:50:07,807 --> 01:50:09,390
LAURA: I can read lips. What did he say?

1481
01:50:09,390 --> 01:50:12,292
(laughter)

1482
01:50:12,292 --> 01:50:15,361
MATT: As he leans over, he says, "Kent, you better
go get the box."

1483
01:50:15,361 --> 01:50:16,648
LAURA: Okay.

1484
01:50:16,648 --> 01:50:23,515
MATT: "Right, okay." Steps away, runs up to the
guest room that they were staying, comes back down

1485
01:50:23,515 --> 01:50:25,453
carrying the small chest.

1486
01:50:25,453 --> 01:50:31,927
LAURA: Thank you so much! I open it up and count
it.

1487
01:50:31,927 --> 01:50:41,416
MATT: Okay. (laughs) It'll take you a little
while. It's a lot of coin. You get, for about the

1488
01:50:41,416 --> 01:50:45,461
next 30-ish minutes or so, you're counting through
and you're starting to get towards the bottom of

1489
01:50:45,461 --> 01:50:54,922
it and you've gotten to about roughly the
3,500-4,000 gold section, before Kent comes up to

1490
01:50:54,922 --> 01:51:02,649
you behind and takes a small satchel and empties
it into the chest as well and goes, "And that as

1491
01:51:02,649 --> 01:51:06,747
"well, sorry. Keeping it separate, so in case--"

1492
01:51:06,747 --> 01:51:07,957
LAURA: In case we got robbed.

1493
01:51:07,957 --> 01:51:09,287
MATT: "Right, you wouldn't lose everything."

1494
01:51:09,287 --> 01:51:10,367
LAURA: That's so kind of you.

1495
01:51:10,367 --> 01:51:11,495
MATT: "Thinking ahead."

1496
01:51:11,495 --> 01:51:13,758
LAURA: What nice friends you have, Scanlan.

1497
01:51:13,758 --> 01:51:15,222
SAM: Well, you know.

1498
01:51:15,222 --> 01:51:16,461
LAURA: They're so giving.

1499
01:51:16,461 --> 01:51:17,563
SAM: They're cool.

1500
01:51:17,563 --> 01:51:20,438
TRAVIS: How was last night, huh?

1501
01:51:20,438 --> 01:51:22,091
SAM: Ugh.

1502
01:51:22,091 --> 01:51:25,814
TRAVIS: Pretty wild? Thank god the walls are made
of stone!

1503
01:51:25,814 --> 01:51:30,819
MARISHA: Have we all come downstairs or are we all
sitting around--

1504
01:51:30,819 --> 01:51:32,253
MATT: You've all, eventually, come downstairs.

1505
01:51:32,253 --> 01:51:34,976
SAM: Let's just say I struck out, all right?

1506
01:51:34,976 --> 01:51:36,594
TRAVIS: You? Struck out?

1507
01:51:36,594 --> 01:51:37,909
SAM: Yeah, it's fine.

1508
01:51:37,909 --> 01:51:39,451
TRAVIS: Maybe I should have a go at her, then.

1509
01:51:39,451 --> 01:51:43,669
SAM: No! No, no, no! She doesn't like our kind,
she's--

1510
01:51:43,669 --> 01:51:46,608
TALIESIN: What is 'our kind' supposed to mean?

1511
01:51:46,608 --> 01:51:51,274
SAM: She's off-limits. I saw her first.

1512
01:51:51,274 --> 01:51:56,222
TRAVIS: Wait, wait, wait. Are you in love?

1513
01:51:56,222 --> 01:51:59,451
SAM: Yes, you could say so.

1514
01:51:59,451 --> 01:52:01,533
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

1515
01:52:01,533 --> 01:52:04,215
TALIESIN: Did you hear that, Pike?

1516
01:52:04,215 --> 01:52:10,330
MARISHA: No, I don't think she did.

1517
01:52:10,330 --> 01:52:12,060
(laughter)

1518
01:52:12,060 --> 01:52:14,502
ASHLEY: Did I hear what?

1519
01:52:14,502 --> 01:52:16,785
(laughter)

1520
01:52:16,785 --> 01:52:18,531
LIAM: Scanlan said he's in love.

1521
01:52:18,531 --> 01:52:20,012
LAURA: With someone else.

1522
01:52:20,012 --> 01:52:22,567
MATT: He said he's in love.

1523
01:52:22,567 --> 01:52:28,651
ASHLEY: Can I insight check him? Because it was
awfully quiet in your room, Scanlan.

1524
01:52:28,651 --> 01:52:32,126
LAURA: It's normally so loud (laughs).

1525
01:52:32,126 --> 01:52:34,123
ASHLEY: Normally so loud.

1526
01:52:34,123 --> 01:52:39,866
Insight check. 18.

1527
01:52:39,866 --> 01:52:44,504
MATT: Were you being honest?

1528
01:52:44,504 --> 01:52:46,256
SAM: I think maybe.

1529
01:52:46,256 --> 01:52:50,520
MATT: Yeah. No, Scanlan seemed pretty honest, if
guarded.

1530
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:53,720
ASHLEY: Okay. Okay.

1531
01:52:53,720 --> 01:53:00,729
MATT: At this point, Dr. Dranzel is like,
"Speaking of which, where is Kaylie? I haven't

1532
01:53:00,729 --> 01:53:02,213
"seen her all morning."

1533
01:53:02,213 --> 01:53:07,387
SAM: I don't know. She ran off last night. But we
should find her.

1534
01:53:07,387 --> 01:53:09,227
MARISHA: You scared another one away?

1535
01:53:09,227 --> 01:53:11,115
SAM: You could say that.

1536
01:53:11,115 --> 01:53:12,799
MARISHA: Oh, Scanlan. I kind of liked her.

1537
01:53:12,799 --> 01:53:14,464
SAM: Your breath is disgusting.

1538
01:53:14,464 --> 01:53:16,320
(laughter)

1539
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:20,113
SAM: Disgusting. Get a root, do something with it.
It's disgusting.

1540
01:53:20,113 --> 01:53:24,405
MARISHA: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Actually, what
happened?

1541
01:53:24,405 --> 01:53:26,869
SAM: That's fine. Ask Pike.

1542
01:53:26,869 --> 01:53:29,425
MARISHA: Pike, what happened?

1543
01:53:29,425 --> 01:53:34,687
ASHLEY: Oh, it's fine! We had so much fun and did
shots of fire-something.

1544
01:53:34,687 --> 01:53:38,138
TRAVIS: Water. Fire water.

1545
01:53:38,138 --> 01:53:39,447
ASHLEY: Grog's idea.

1546
01:53:39,447 --> 01:53:41,066
MARISHA: Grog.

1547
01:53:41,066 --> 01:53:41,999
TRAVIS: What?

1548
01:53:41,999 --> 01:53:45,241
TALIESIN: You had a very good time.

1549
01:53:45,241 --> 01:53:48,834
TRAVIS: You were very passionate. You were like,
"I need fire water," I said, "okay."

1550
01:53:48,834 --> 01:53:52,804
MARISHA: That sounds like something I'd do.

1551
01:53:52,804 --> 01:53:58,543
TALIESIN: And then we planned to investigate a
house and possibly pilfer.

1552
01:53:58,543 --> 01:53:59,926
MATT: "Yes, yes!"

1553
01:53:59,926 --> 01:54:01,664
MARISHA: Wait, we did what?

1554
01:54:01,664 --> 01:54:03,244
SAM: Yes, we're going to go do that today.

1555
01:54:03,244 --> 01:54:04,481
TALIESIN: We're going to investigate a house.

1556
01:54:04,481 --> 01:54:06,722
MARISHA: No, what was the second word you said?

1557
01:54:06,722 --> 01:54:07,912
TALIESIN: Possibly.

1558
01:54:07,912 --> 01:54:10,077
MARISHA: The third word you said?

1559
01:54:10,077 --> 01:54:11,157
TALIESIN: Pilfer.

1560
01:54:11,157 --> 01:54:12,123
MARISHA: That one.

1561
01:54:12,123 --> 01:54:13,043
TALIESIN: Yes.

1562
01:54:13,043 --> 01:54:14,337
MARISHA: Well, what, what?

1563
01:54:14,337 --> 01:54:16,009
SAM: It's a bad guy's house, so it'll be fine.

1564
01:54:16,009 --> 01:54:17,158
MARISHA: Whose house?

1565
01:54:17,158 --> 01:54:19,611
TRAVIS: So you remember when we went to General
Krieg's house?

1566
01:54:19,611 --> 01:54:20,970
SAM: We'll explain on the way.

1567
01:54:20,970 --> 01:54:22,151
MARISHA: Wait!

1568
01:54:22,151 --> 01:54:24,411
LAURA: Don't worry about it, Keyleth, we'll talk
about it on the way.

1569
01:54:24,411 --> 01:54:29,712
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's all good. We're making sure the
city is safe from the house. It's empty. We're

1570
01:54:29,712 --> 01:54:31,897
going to make sure it stays empty and safe.

1571
01:54:31,897 --> 01:54:35,433
TALIESIN: Last time we were there, things attacked
us, so we're going to double-check.

1572
01:54:35,433 --> 01:54:39,696
MARISHA: Yeah, the dragon that we provoked. So,
you know.

1573
01:54:39,696 --> 01:54:42,609
TALIESIN: Mysterious things have been happening,
though.

1574
01:54:42,609 --> 01:54:45,497
MARISHA: What do you all want in the house?

1575
01:54:45,497 --> 01:54:47,030
TALIESIN: Nothing.

1576
01:54:47,030 --> 01:54:47,851
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1577
01:54:47,851 --> 01:54:49,154
MARISHA: What do you all want in the house?

1578
01:54:49,154 --> 01:54:52,682
SAM: We don't know. We don't know what's in the
house. It's a mysterious thing to be happening in

1579
01:54:52,682 --> 01:54:53,763
this town.

1580
01:54:53,763 --> 01:54:55,481
MATT: "Yeah, just an investigation."

1581
01:54:55,481 --> 01:54:59,523
SAM: We're going to check it out. We won't do
anything untoward.

1582
01:54:59,523 --> 01:55:06,502
MARISHA: This sounds like nothing we would ever
agree to. Ever. We would never agree to

1583
01:55:06,502 --> 01:55:08,158
investigate a house with nothing.

1584
01:55:08,158 --> 01:55:11,618
TRAVIS: Well, somebody said that they were afraid
that bad things were coming out of it.

1585
01:55:11,618 --> 01:55:16,925
MARISHA: So we're now going to go into a house
with bad things coming out of it. And we don't

1586
01:55:16,925 --> 01:55:22,231
know what these bad things are. What did we agree
to, Percy? Percy, what did we agree to?

1587
01:55:22,231 --> 01:55:23,184
TALIESIN: We--

1588
01:55:23,184 --> 01:55:24,320
MARISHA: Percy, tell me.

1589
01:55:24,320 --> 01:55:28,508
TALIESIN: We agreed to take a look inside this
house and if there was anything valuable we would

1590
01:55:28,508 --> 01:55:29,956
liberate it.

1591
01:55:29,956 --> 01:55:34,608
MATT: "And while you guys do that, we'll wait here
and eagerly keep an eye out for Kaylie and--"

1592
01:55:34,608 --> 01:55:42,600
SAM: Yes, please do. And keep a good eye out for
her.

1593
01:55:42,600 --> 01:55:44,546
MATT: "Sure."

1594
01:55:44,546 --> 01:55:47,081
SAM: And if you have a gig tonight-- Do you have a gig
tonight anywhere?

1595
01:55:47,081 --> 01:55:48,324
MATT: "Not this evening, no."

1596
01:55:48,324 --> 01:55:53,656
SAM: All right. You can use our place as a base of
operations, but please try not to steal anything else.

1597
01:55:53,656 --> 01:55:55,668
MATT: "I wouldn't dream of it, Scanlan."

1598
01:55:55,668 --> 01:56:00,471
SAM: Well, you would dream of it. You'd absolutely
dream of it. Just don't do it.

1599
01:56:00,471 --> 01:56:04,373
MATT: Tips his hat a little. "Understood."

1600
01:56:04,373 --> 01:56:07,059
LIAM: Maybe we could pay Jarett a little
overtime.

1601
01:56:07,059 --> 01:56:09,331
LAURA: I fully, fully intend--

1602
01:56:09,331 --> 01:56:13,486
MATT: And as you turn and look over at the door,
Jarett's there with his crossbow, still over on

1603
01:56:13,486 --> 01:56:15,831
the side, looking in. He glances over.

1604
01:56:15,831 --> 01:56:19,526
LAURA: Thank you.

1605
01:56:19,526 --> 01:56:22,525
SAM: All right. Let's go check out this house.

1606
01:56:22,525 --> 01:56:23,929
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's go.

1607
01:56:23,929 --> 01:56:25,150
MARISHA: No.

1608
01:56:25,150 --> 01:56:27,744
SAM: You want to stay and take a look after these
people?

1609
01:56:27,744 --> 01:56:28,935
MARISHA: Maybe.

1610
01:56:28,935 --> 01:56:30,077
TRAVIS: Okay.

1611
01:56:30,077 --> 01:56:32,502
SAM: Well, no need to be coy, stinky.

1612
01:56:32,502 --> 01:56:37,015
MARISHA: I'm not going to go stealing from some
house--

1613
01:56:37,015 --> 01:56:38,667
SAM: We're not stealing, we're investigating.

1614
01:56:38,667 --> 01:56:42,263
MARISHA: -- when you guys aren't even giving me
all the information.

1615
01:56:42,263 --> 01:56:47,847
LAURA: Maybe if somebody wasn't so drunk last
night, they would've had the information.

1616
01:56:47,847 --> 01:56:49,233
TALIESIN: That's very fair.

1617
01:56:49,233 --> 01:56:56,370
MARISHA: Well, maybe if I didn't have friends who
were such douchebags.

1618
01:56:56,370 --> 01:56:57,949
LAURA: Oh. Well.

1619
01:56:57,949 --> 01:57:00,321
SAM: She is the worst drunk.

1620
01:57:00,321 --> 01:57:03,290
TRAVIS: And we leave.

1621
01:57:03,290 --> 01:57:05,970
MARISHA: I didn't even get to see the sunrise.

1622
01:57:05,970 --> 01:57:07,425
LAURA: Aww.

1623
01:57:07,425 --> 01:57:10,244
TALIESIN: I'll make sure you see a sunrise. Now
come on. We need you with us anyway.

1624
01:57:10,244 --> 01:57:12,830
MARISHA: No!

1625
01:57:12,830 --> 01:57:14,672
TALIESIN: To keep us honest.

1626
01:57:14,672 --> 01:57:16,491
MARISHA: Percy. Pike!

1627
01:57:16,491 --> 01:57:22,455
ASHLEY: Well, I think we should just go.

1628
01:57:22,455 --> 01:57:24,025
TRAVIS: Yes!

1629
01:57:24,025 --> 01:57:32,592
ASHLEY: You know, how about we just go? You could
wait outside just in case something happens.

1630
01:57:32,592 --> 01:57:33,928
MARISHA: Vex.

1631
01:57:33,928 --> 01:57:36,174
LAURA: I don't want to steal anything either.

1632
01:57:36,174 --> 01:57:38,393
TALIESIN: We should take a look.

1633
01:57:38,393 --> 01:57:45,198
MATT: At this point, Zedd, the rather rotund
drummer, has finished eating his breakfast. He's

1634
01:57:45,198 --> 01:57:50,767
got bits of egg in his beard. He spins around and
goes, "You're more than welcome to stay here with us."

1635
01:57:50,767 --> 01:57:55,291
LAURA: Yes, she is, because it's our house.

1636
01:57:55,291 --> 01:57:59,041
MATT: "Right."

1637
01:57:59,041 --> 01:58:04,234
TALIESIN: The faster we do this, the faster they
leave, at the very least.

1638
01:58:04,234 --> 01:58:06,049
MARISHA: I don't even know what we're doing.

1639
01:58:06,049 --> 01:58:07,826
TALIESIN: It'll be fine. We'll explain it on the
way.

1640
01:58:07,826 --> 01:58:09,553
MATT: Grog leaves.

1641
01:58:09,553 --> 01:58:10,867
TRAVIS: Who else is coming?

1642
01:58:10,867 --> 01:58:11,978
SAM: I'm coming.

1643
01:58:11,978 --> 01:58:13,488
LAURA: Trinket follows before I do.

1644
01:58:13,488 --> 01:58:14,761
TALIESIN: Trinket's coming.

1645
01:58:14,761 --> 01:58:16,470
MARISHA: Trinket is a bear.

1646
01:58:16,470 --> 01:58:18,130
TALIESIN: Yes. A wise bear.

1647
01:58:18,130 --> 01:58:25,659
LAURA: Keyleth, seriously, I don't want to steal
anything. I want to find out why these-- They

1648
01:58:25,659 --> 01:58:27,711
can't hear me, I'm whispering to her.

1649
01:58:27,711 --> 01:58:30,112
TALIESIN: I think we're already on our way, aren't
we?

1650
01:58:30,112 --> 01:58:35,903
LAURA: We're walking. I want to find out why they
want to get into the house. That's all. Something

1651
01:58:35,903 --> 01:58:38,335
shady's going on.

1652
01:58:38,335 --> 01:58:46,093
LIAM: The last time we were there, something
looked at us through things on the wall. Right? So

1653
01:58:46,093 --> 01:58:51,712
it knew where we were and we fled. We have no idea
what we left behind. We left in a hurry.

1654
01:58:51,712 --> 01:58:55,471
TALIESIN: And the new owner has also left in a
hurry.

1655
01:58:55,471 --> 01:59:03,097
MARISHA: Okay. Let's go.

1656
01:59:03,097 --> 01:59:05,579
LAURA: We're keeping things safe.

1657
01:59:05,579 --> 01:59:08,256
TRAVIS: No, we should stay, we shouldn't go to the
house-- Yeah, let's fucking go!

1658
01:59:08,256 --> 01:59:12,728
MARISHA: We're keeping things safe. Vox Machina.
Woo, let's go.

1659
01:59:12,728 --> 01:59:16,531
MATT: All right.

1660
01:59:16,531 --> 01:59:18,691
TALIESIN: It's tough being the good one.

1661
01:59:18,691 --> 01:59:20,460
LAURA: I don't like them at our keep.

1662
01:59:20,460 --> 01:59:22,498
SAM: We're taking the bear or leaving the bear?

1663
01:59:22,498 --> 01:59:24,675
LAURA: We're fucking taking the fucking bear!

1664
01:59:24,675 --> 01:59:26,351
SAM: All right, let's go.

1665
01:59:26,351 --> 01:59:28,347
(laughter)

1666
01:59:28,347 --> 01:59:31,769
SAM: Just a simple question.

1667
01:59:31,769 --> 01:59:35,488
LAURA: That's my whole fighting fucking thing is I
have a fucking bear. That's the whole point of the

1668
01:59:35,488 --> 01:59:38,358
class that I took. I keep the bear.

1669
01:59:38,358 --> 01:59:40,358
LIAM: What kind of classes? Have you been going to
night school?

1670
01:59:40,358 --> 01:59:42,685
LAURA: Yeah, classes. You know, writing, creative
writing.

1671
01:59:42,685 --> 01:59:46,431
LIAM: Emon Community College.

1672
01:59:46,431 --> 01:59:48,942
LAURA: Yeah. I'm learning things, every day.

1673
01:59:48,942 --> 01:59:54,373
LIAM: Everyone says words. I don't know what all
these words mean. What's a douchebag?

1674
01:59:54,373 --> 01:59:57,557
TRAVIS: We can remember how to get back to that
house, right?

1675
01:59:57,557 --> 01:59:58,663
MATT: Yeah.

1676
01:59:58,663 --> 02:00:00,121
TALIESIN: Just skate over that one.

1677
02:00:00,121 --> 02:00:03,843
MATT: You guys make your way towards the Cloudtop
District. You're allowed through the gates and you

1678
02:00:03,843 --> 02:00:10,407
find your way across the central residential area
to the far northeast side of the district. This is

1679
02:00:10,407 --> 02:00:15,229
further away from the palace, within viewing
distance from Allura's tower, which still stands

1680
02:00:15,229 --> 02:00:21,095
over the entirety of the district, like this
looming monolith. Currently empty and cold as

1681
02:00:21,095 --> 02:00:27,697
she's over in Whitestone for this investigation.
However, you do come across the familiar site of

1682
02:00:27,697 --> 02:00:35,001
General Krieg's homestead, the one you infiltrated
a little over a year ago. It looks like it's a

1683
02:00:35,001 --> 02:00:45,741
little dilapidated, but strangely enough, for a
person who's purchased this estate, there wasn't

1684
02:00:45,741 --> 02:00:53,655
much attempt to try and beautify it. The ivy has
overgrown the bottom of it. There is still the

1685
02:00:53,655 --> 02:00:58,053
iron gate around it. It is currently closed and
there are no guards posted around it. It looks

1686
02:00:58,053 --> 02:01:02,636
empty and vacant and dark in the windows. It's
about noon.

1687
02:01:02,636 --> 02:01:04,551
LIAM: Have a look around?

1688
02:01:04,551 --> 02:01:08,097
LAURA: Yeah. Go around the back.

1689
02:01:08,097 --> 02:01:13,282
MATT: Okay. You guys scoot around to the back
side. Anything in particular you're looking for?

1690
02:01:13,282 --> 02:01:15,109
LAURA: Any signs of life?

1691
02:01:15,109 --> 02:01:17,484
LIAM: Anyone around? Watching?

1692
02:01:17,484 --> 02:01:20,810
MATT: Perception check. For those who wish to look
around.

1693
02:01:20,810 --> 02:01:26,994
LIAM: 23 for me.

1694
02:01:26,994 --> 02:01:28,113
LAURA: One.

1695
02:01:28,113 --> 02:01:29,661
TRAVIS: Five.

1696
02:01:29,661 --> 02:01:30,733
TALIESIN: 16.

1697
02:01:30,733 --> 02:01:38,526
MATT: All right. We have Percy and Vax glance
over. You take about five minutes or so paying

1698
02:01:38,526 --> 02:01:42,943
very close attention to any sort of possible
movement or light within the building. Nothing. It

1699
02:01:42,943 --> 02:01:48,036
is dark. It is motionless. The windows are closed.
It's a dark interior and you can't really make any

1700
02:01:48,036 --> 02:01:52,044
details out of the inside from this point, because
it is so closed off. Some of the curtains have

1701
02:01:52,044 --> 02:01:56,493
actually been drawn shut. But not all of them, a
few of the windows are open.

1702
02:01:56,493 --> 02:01:58,477
LIAM: What about around the house? Outside the
house?

1703
02:01:58,477 --> 02:02:01,928
MATT: Outside the house? The grass, the lawn that
surrounds this--

1704
02:02:01,928 --> 02:02:03,464
LIAM: Or surrounding buildings.

1705
02:02:03,464 --> 02:02:08,886
MATT: Surrounding buildings. There a number of
other homes as well, but this area is the more

1706
02:02:08,886 --> 02:02:16,126
upper class, upper crust aspect of Emon. A number
of various manors and rather decadent buildings.

1707
02:02:16,126 --> 02:02:22,560
Each building has its own color scheme, its own
architecture. Each thing is trying to be distinct

1708
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:29,580
and different in this microcosm of the societal
space of Emon, where most of the gold passes

1709
02:02:29,580 --> 02:02:34,339
through. They have their own worries about
presentation. Which is interesting, because in the

1710
02:02:34,339 --> 02:02:39,523
middle of all these very beautiful homes, you have
General Krieg's home, which is pretty basic, red

1711
02:02:39,523 --> 02:02:46,353
brick, utilitarian and sticks out like a sore
thumb by comparison. Or doesn't stick out at all

1712
02:02:46,353 --> 02:02:51,352
by comparison, because it's so normal-looking.

1713
02:02:51,352 --> 02:02:52,960
TRAVIS: I like it.

1714
02:02:52,960 --> 02:03:03,203
LAURA: Can I ask you guys, before we do anything,
maybe it would be best to tell the guards that

1715
02:03:03,203 --> 02:03:10,048
we're investigating a disappearance? We've heard
things about the house and we need to check

1716
02:03:10,048 --> 02:03:10,888
inside.

1717
02:03:10,888 --> 02:03:11,993
SAM: What guards?

1718
02:03:11,993 --> 02:03:13,163
MARISHA: I agree.

1719
02:03:13,163 --> 02:03:18,614
LAURA: It's obviously shady if we go sneaking in,
but if we say, "We're going in the house, because

1720
02:03:18,614 --> 02:03:22,234
"we worry for it," then it's okay.

1721
02:03:22,234 --> 02:03:24,598
TRAVIS: Should we tell them when we go to the
bathroom, too?

1722
02:03:24,598 --> 02:03:26,135
LAURA: Maybe, Grog.

1723
02:03:26,135 --> 02:03:27,852
SAM: We're above them in rank.

1724
02:03:27,852 --> 02:03:28,756
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1725
02:03:28,756 --> 02:03:35,154
MARISHA: But the guards have the ability to call
higher authority on us and we don't want people--

1726
02:03:35,154 --> 02:03:37,706
TALIESIN: Are there any guards that we can see
right now?

1727
02:03:37,706 --> 02:03:42,870
MATT: Glancing about, there are none in your
immediate vicinity. You're not that far from the

1728
02:03:42,870 --> 02:03:48,350
Citrine Garrison, which is the centerpiece of the
higher military folk. And they do have their own

1729
02:03:48,350 --> 02:03:51,655
guard station about. You're about a ten-minute
walk from the palace, which has a number of guards

1730
02:03:51,655 --> 02:03:54,841
throughout, and you do have some patrols that come
through the city. But in the middle of the day in

1731
02:03:54,841 --> 02:04:00,086
the Cloudtop, it's not as pressing a place for
guard presence. So you haven't seen any

1732
02:04:00,086 --> 02:04:04,333
immediately around you. But I'm sure if you wait
for the next 15-20 minutes, one will probably come

1733
02:04:04,333 --> 02:04:05,521
your way.

1734
02:04:05,521 --> 02:04:10,511
LAURA: I mean, they probably have a key to General
Krieg's place. We can just barge on in.

1735
02:04:10,511 --> 02:04:13,824
SAM: Well, it's owned by someone, isn't it?
Someone deserted it.

1736
02:04:13,824 --> 02:04:15,604
LAURA: Did somebody buy it after him?

1737
02:04:15,604 --> 02:04:17,171
SAM: Yes, it's private property.

1738
02:04:17,171 --> 02:04:18,352
LAURA: Oh.

1739
02:04:18,352 --> 02:04:22,408
SAM: You're being very prudent.

1740
02:04:22,408 --> 02:04:27,963
TRAVIS: Yeah, we'll totally wait here while you go
tell the guards that we want to go inspect

1741
02:04:27,963 --> 02:04:29,016
something.

1742
02:04:29,016 --> 02:04:36,307
SAM: We're better at this than them. Let's go do
what we do. Right, Trinket?

1743
02:04:36,307 --> 02:04:40,669
MATT: (bear noises) As he growls into your ear.

1744
02:04:40,669 --> 02:04:41,727
LAURA: No.

1745
02:04:41,727 --> 02:04:42,956
SAM: How can you resist that?

1746
02:04:42,956 --> 02:04:45,232
TALIESIN: If we come across a guard, I'd be happy
to inform them of what we're doing.

1747
02:04:45,232 --> 02:04:50,090
MARISHA: Why don't we at least do a little bit of
pre-planning? Do we need like a warrant for

1748
02:04:50,090 --> 02:04:51,218
something like this?

1749
02:04:51,218 --> 02:04:53,556
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck that. I walk up to the door and
knock really loud.

1750
02:04:53,556 --> 02:04:55,190
LAURA: There's a gate around the outside.

1751
02:04:55,190 --> 02:04:56,253
MATT: There is a gate.

1752
02:04:56,253 --> 02:04:57,415
TRAVIS: I thought we were around the back.

1753
02:04:57,415 --> 02:05:02,091
MATT: You guys were around back. There's the
gate, which is about-- the fence itself is about

1754
02:05:02,091 --> 02:05:06,216
seven feet tall with little metal impaler
spikes on the top.

1755
02:05:06,271 --> 02:05:07,713
TRAVIS: I'll hop over that.

1756
02:05:07,713 --> 02:05:11,339
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make an acrobatics
check.

1757
02:05:11,339 --> 02:05:12,803
SAM: Hop check.

1758
02:05:12,803 --> 02:05:14,634
TRAVIS: 15.

1759
02:05:14,634 --> 02:05:22,859
MATT: Okay! Okay. You deftly avoid falling upon
one and spearing your manhood, thankfully. As you

1760
02:05:22,859 --> 02:05:30,371
grab the edge, (grunts) loftily heft yourself over
the top of the gate, landing within the other side

1761
02:05:30,371 --> 02:05:33,690
of the browning yard that hasn't been well-kept.

1762
02:05:33,690 --> 02:05:39,857
TRAVIS: Hmm. You might want to tell the guard I'm
walking on the yard. Let them know I'm going. And

1763
02:05:39,857 --> 02:05:42,790
I go off towards the house.

1764
02:05:42,790 --> 02:05:45,983
MATT: Grog walks away from you guys towards the
house brazenly in the middle of the midday sun.

1765
02:05:45,983 --> 02:05:47,601
TALIESIN: Grog, that rhymed! Well done!

1766
02:05:47,601 --> 02:05:49,347
LAURA: Anybody want a peanut?

1767
02:05:49,347 --> 02:05:53,066
MARISHA: I stand next to Vex, irritated.

1768
02:05:53,066 --> 02:05:59,597
LIAM: And during that whole exchange, I've been
changing cloaks and putting on the red one. Great.

1769
02:05:59,597 --> 02:06:00,999
MATT: Okay.

1770
02:06:00,999 --> 02:06:03,180
LAURA: Subtle. So stealthy now.

1771
02:06:03,180 --> 02:06:07,233
LIAM: I don't need to be subtle, I'm just standing
around, you guys are arguing, he's making a fool

1772
02:06:07,289 --> 02:06:13,051
of you, I'm just changing my cloak. I have
17 cloaks.

1773
02:06:13,051 --> 02:06:15,504
SAM: Do you bring around one of those like--

1774
02:06:15,504 --> 02:06:16,812
MARISHA: Wardrobe racks?

1775
02:06:16,812 --> 02:06:18,422
SAM: Yeah, rolling wardrobe racks

1776
02:06:18,422 --> 02:06:21,861
LIAM: Yeah. It's on wheels, it's on wheels. It's
functional.

1777
02:06:21,861 --> 02:06:23,892
TRAVIS: It bobbles on the cobblestones.

1778
02:06:23,892 --> 02:06:27,403
MATT: You're going, "Shh! Follow me." (squeaking
sound)

1779
02:06:27,403 --> 02:06:28,635
(laughter)

1780
02:06:28,635 --> 02:06:32,304
LIAM: They smoosh up to about the size of a
cabbage. It's really all right.

1781
02:06:32,304 --> 02:06:36,279
LAURA: So you have a very wrinkly red cloak on
right now.

1782
02:06:36,279 --> 02:06:39,950
LIAM: You know what? Never mind! I think, what I
think is that Grog and Pike should lead the way,

1783
02:06:39,950 --> 02:06:44,212
stealth in, pick all the locks, and I think
everything will go really well.

1784
02:06:44,212 --> 02:06:45,918
TRAVIS: That's a great idea.

1785
02:06:45,918 --> 02:06:47,687
LIAM: I'm going to hang back. I think that's the
way to go.

1786
02:06:47,687 --> 02:06:49,551
MATT: Grog, you're already at the front door.

1787
02:06:49,551 --> 02:06:51,514
TRAVIS: Brilliant. Boom, boom, boom.

1788
02:06:51,514 --> 02:06:53,718
SAM: Grog just knocked.

1789
02:06:53,718 --> 02:06:55,594
MATT: You guys hear in the distance (knocking) as
Grog's fist is now hitting--

1790
02:06:55,594 --> 02:06:57,055
TALIESIN: Walking to the front gate.

1791
02:06:57,055 --> 02:07:00,375
MARISHA: You know, I could Skywrite that we're
here in the sky again.

1792
02:07:00,375 --> 02:07:01,981
MATT: Nobody answers the door.

1793
02:07:01,981 --> 02:07:04,885
TRAVIS: There's no answer at the door!

1794
02:07:04,885 --> 02:07:07,249
ASHLEY: Can I try picking the lock?

1795
02:07:07,249 --> 02:07:08,846
MATT: Do you have lockpicks?

1796
02:07:08,846 --> 02:07:11,133
MARISHA: She's going to literally try picking the
lock? Yes!

1797
02:07:11,133 --> 02:07:12,384
ASHLEY: Do I have a lockpick?

1798
02:07:12,384 --> 02:07:17,918
LIAM: I take Pike by the hand and go: here you go,
chum, and I slap down my set in her hand.

1799
02:07:17,918 --> 02:07:21,904
MATT: Vex appears seemingly out of nowhere and
slaps his lockpicks--

1800
02:07:21,904 --> 02:07:23,170
LIAM: I'm Vax.

1801
02:07:23,170 --> 02:07:28,199
MATT: I'm sorry, Vax. So, Pike. I've gotten much
better at that.

1802
02:07:28,199 --> 02:07:30,781
MARISHA: It happens to everybody.

1803
02:07:30,781 --> 02:07:32,135
MATT: Pike, you want to try and pick the lock?

1804
02:07:32,135 --> 02:07:35,099
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1805
02:07:35,099 --> 02:07:38,917
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll a d20 and add
your dexterity.

1806
02:07:38,917 --> 02:07:40,332
SAM: I'm going to inspire her.

1807
02:07:40,332 --> 02:07:41,383
MATT: Okay, go for it.

1808
02:07:41,383 --> 02:07:42,757
SAM: With a limerick.

1809
02:07:42,757 --> 02:07:45,117
LIAM: There's no way this is not good.

1810
02:07:45,117 --> 02:07:50,968
SAM: All right, I'm going to inspire her. There
once was a gnome with a mace. Who had an adorable

1811
02:07:50,968 --> 02:07:57,999
face. She never would bed me, but I hope she won't
forget me. 'Cause oh how I do love the chase.

1812
02:07:57,999 --> 02:08:01,035
ALL: Aw!

1813
02:08:01,035 --> 02:08:04,010
MATT: That is a real easy d10 inspiration die for
you, Pike.

1814
02:08:04,010 --> 02:08:06,508
MARISHA: That's a panty-dropper, as Sam would say.

1815
02:08:06,508 --> 02:08:09,779
MATT: So go ahead and roll a d20, add your
dexterity modifier.

1816
02:08:09,779 --> 02:08:11,083
ASHLEY: Okay.

1817
02:08:11,083 --> 02:08:12,922
MATT: Which is what?

1818
02:08:12,922 --> 02:08:14,760
ASHLEY: So in addition to the 20?

1819
02:08:14,760 --> 02:08:17,832
MATT: Yeah, well, what'd you roll?

1820
02:08:17,832 --> 02:08:21,881
ASHLEY: I rolled a six.

1821
02:08:21,881 --> 02:08:24,643
MATT: Okay. Then what's your dexterity modifier?

1822
02:08:24,643 --> 02:08:25,818
ASHLEY: One.

1823
02:08:25,818 --> 02:08:29,140
MATT: That's a seven. Now go ahead and roll a d10
and add that to it.

1824
02:08:29,140 --> 02:08:33,180
ASHLEY: Okay. I rolled a nine.

1825
02:08:33,180 --> 02:08:34,504
ALL: Oh!

1826
02:08:34,504 --> 02:08:35,578
SAM: That helps.

1827
02:08:35,578 --> 02:08:41,691
MATT: All right. Wow. Okay, that puts you at a 15,
which is actually directly the DC of the door.

1828
02:08:41,691 --> 02:08:43,112
ASHLEY: Wait! 16! 16!

1829
02:08:43,112 --> 02:08:44,378
MATT: Even better!

1830
02:08:44,378 --> 02:08:46,066
LIAM: Everybody, meet your new rogue.

1831
02:08:46,066 --> 02:08:50,121
MATT: Yes. With the rattle of metal plate, the
untrained eye, and a couple times you hear the

1832
02:08:50,121 --> 02:08:56,841
metal (creaking) beginning to bend as she, having
no previous experience really with lockpicks from

1833
02:08:56,841 --> 02:09:01,958
what you know, you're afraid she's going to break
your toolset. However, she's picked up a few

1834
02:09:01,958 --> 02:09:08,342
things while she was at sea with, you know, more
of the swashbuckling brigades over the western

1835
02:09:08,342 --> 02:09:15,461
shores, and much to your surprise, she (click,
opening sound). The door opens and the dark

1836
02:09:15,461 --> 02:09:17,500
interior of the home is at your disposal.

1837
02:09:17,500 --> 02:09:22,288
SAM: See, this is our problem. We've been
approaching doors without Pike! We need Pike!

1838
02:09:22,288 --> 02:09:24,879
TRAVIS: I reach down and high-five Pike.

1839
02:09:24,879 --> 02:09:28,536
LIAM: She pushes massive statues, she unlocks all
doors.

1840
02:09:28,536 --> 02:09:32,848
TRAVIS: I stick my head in the door and I go:
hello? Is anyone home?

1841
02:09:32,848 --> 02:09:42,512
ASHLEY: I give his pick back to him. And I say: it
was just luck, Vax.

1842
02:09:42,512 --> 02:09:45,056
LIAM: Shut up, baby. I know it.

1843
02:09:45,056 --> 02:09:49,606
TRAVIS: I lean back and I go: there's nobody
answering from inside. Vex, you might want to go tell

1844
02:09:49,606 --> 02:09:51,580
the guard no one's inside.

1845
02:09:51,580 --> 02:09:58,530
LAURA: Asshole. I feel like we have a blessing of
Sarenrae though to go inside.

1846
02:09:58,530 --> 02:10:05,190
MATT: As you step into the home a little bit, the
first thing you notice is the smell. Immediate,

1847
02:10:05,190 --> 02:10:13,929
pungent scent of decay hits your nose. The source
is not in immediate visual range and you can't

1848
02:10:13,929 --> 02:10:22,669
really tell what type of decay it is, but it's a
definitively terrible smell, and one that

1849
02:10:22,669 --> 02:10:27,261
permeates the interior of the foyer. Foyer.

1850
02:10:27,261 --> 02:10:29,885
TRAVIS: It smells like roses inside.

1851
02:10:29,885 --> 02:10:31,274
TALIESIN: I'm coming in.

1852
02:10:31,274 --> 02:10:35,513
MATT: All right, you come in. It's an experience
as you guys walk in, it catches you off guard and

1853
02:10:35,513 --> 02:10:39,842
you stand, the main foyer open before you, the
only light currently within the interior is the

1854
02:10:39,842 --> 02:10:43,468
bit of sunlight that's bouncing in from the front
open doors and a few of the windows in the

1855
02:10:43,468 --> 02:10:48,359
distance. To your left is a dining room, there's a
big red carpet in the center of the room, there's

1856
02:10:48,359 --> 02:10:52,097
tapestries put all-- actually, the decor in here
is much more garish than you recall. When you were

1857
02:10:52,097 --> 02:10:55,558
last here it was very simple, it was very
minimalist, and you got the impression that the

1858
02:10:55,558 --> 02:11:00,318
house for the most part was not being lived in
outside of the servant. You recall there was a

1859
02:11:00,318 --> 02:11:07,492
passageway across from the foyer that led to a
gallery and that which had the--

1860
02:11:07,492 --> 02:11:09,726
TALIESIN: The trap room, the little portal in it.

1861
02:11:09,726 --> 02:11:13,176
MATT: Yep. The false wall in the back.

1862
02:11:13,176 --> 02:11:14,989
LAURA: Oh right. Behind the tapestry, right?

1863
02:11:14,989 --> 02:11:16,844
TALIESIN: Let's find the source of the smell.

1864
02:11:16,844 --> 02:11:22,026
LAURA: Trinket is actually really good at sniffing
things out, so maybe he can lead us to the smell.

1865
02:11:22,026 --> 02:11:23,367
ASHLEY: Good boy.

1866
02:11:23,367 --> 02:11:28,624
MATT: Trinket comes sniffing up. (sniffing sounds)
Go ahead and make a perception check for Trinket.

1867
02:11:28,624 --> 02:11:36,732
LAURA: Okay. It's too much, it's advantage because
of his smell.

1868
02:11:36,732 --> 02:11:37,700
MATT: True.

1869
02:11:37,700 --> 02:11:40,319
TRAVIS: Wow, those sucked both times.

1870
02:11:40,319 --> 02:11:47,483
LAURA: Shut up. Shit, they do. 16?

1871
02:11:47,483 --> 02:11:48,868
SAM: Oh, that's good!

1872
02:11:48,868 --> 02:11:50,606
LIAM: Enough to open a door.

1873
02:11:50,606 --> 02:12:01,664
MATT: Okay, so Trinket sniffs through, steps into
the center of the foyer, pushes past the carpet

1874
02:12:01,664 --> 02:12:06,298
into the middle of the dining room, and looks up
at the table and as soon as you look over, Trinket

1875
02:12:06,298 --> 02:12:12,078
growls for a moment and you see there on the
center of the dining room table is a meal set up.

1876
02:12:12,078 --> 02:12:19,484
Drink, food, but is completely molded over to the
point where parts of it have bloated and spilled

1877
02:12:19,484 --> 02:12:25,862
off and liquid has-- the putrescence has spread
across part of the surface.

1878
02:12:25,862 --> 02:12:27,463
TALIESIN: Oof, I throw the gas mask on.

1879
02:12:27,463 --> 02:12:31,886
MATT: It's been there for quite some time, you
don't know quite how long.

1880
02:12:31,886 --> 02:12:33,440
SAM: Free food, Grog.

1881
02:12:33,440 --> 02:12:35,272
TRAVIS: I know, it smells pretty good in here.

1882
02:12:35,272 --> 02:12:38,033
LAURA: Is there dust on the ground? Has it been
that long?

1883
02:12:38,033 --> 02:12:41,533
MATT: Yeah, you check down, you put your finger
across it, and it is a little dusty. It's not been

1884
02:12:41,533 --> 02:12:43,916
an extremely long period of time but there is a
layer of dust.

1885
02:12:43,916 --> 02:12:47,589
LAURA: Is there anything changing the dust? Is
there any tracks in it or anything?

1886
02:12:47,589 --> 02:12:50,006
MATT: Currently from what you can see, no.

1887
02:12:50,006 --> 02:12:52,791
MARISHA: Have we all entered?

1888
02:12:52,791 --> 02:12:55,658
MATT: You've all begun to walk into the foyer,
yes.

1889
02:12:55,658 --> 02:13:00,788
TALIESIN: Let's search the upstairs first, see if
there's a body or otherwise.

1890
02:13:00,788 --> 02:13:03,700
MARISHA: Oh god, this isn't helping with the
hangover.

1891
02:13:03,700 --> 02:13:05,723
LIAM: Does the smell get more intense at the
food?

1892
02:13:05,723 --> 02:13:08,886
MATT: Yes, the smell gets more intense as you
enter the dining room.

1893
02:13:08,886 --> 02:13:10,164
SAM: Oh, so it's the food.

1894
02:13:10,164 --> 02:13:12,111
LIAM: I almost can't smell you.

1895
02:13:12,111 --> 02:13:24,753
MARISHA: Can I Druidcraft the table and take like
the decaying food and maybe, I don't know, grow

1896
02:13:24,753 --> 02:13:27,441
some flowers out of it, try to make it look nice?

1897
02:13:27,441 --> 02:13:28,580
TALIESIN: Compost it?

1898
02:13:28,580 --> 02:13:29,940
MARISHA: Try and compost it, yeah?

1899
02:13:29,940 --> 02:13:35,832
MATT: Sure. You take a moment and concentrate and
use your Druidcraft. The fungus begins to reform

1900
02:13:35,832 --> 02:13:43,592
and more mushroom-like spores begin to appear out
of it and sprout from the current festering mass.

1901
02:13:43,592 --> 02:13:50,825
Whereas once was a nasty spore cloud-based fungus,
you've now converted almost into a colored

1902
02:13:50,825 --> 02:13:52,880
mushroom-type presentation

1903
02:13:52,880 --> 02:13:55,507
LAURA: Don't eat it, Grog.

1904
02:13:55,507 --> 02:13:56,313
TRAVIS: What?

1905
02:13:56,313 --> 02:13:59,248
MATT: It'll probably lessen the stench over time,
but no immediate effect as the smell has been

1906
02:13:59,248 --> 02:14:01,370
hanging here stagnant for quite a while.

1907
02:14:01,370 --> 02:14:05,440
MARISHA: It's like a big old terrarium now

1908
02:14:05,440 --> 02:14:08,699
TRAVIS: So it's a big old house. Can we like split
up and get it over with?

1909
02:14:08,699 --> 02:14:09,866
SAM: Split the party.

1910
02:14:09,866 --> 02:14:11,126
MARISHA: Split the party!

1911
02:14:11,126 --> 02:14:15,340
TALIESIN: We've all got earrings, let's start
checking rooms and we'll get to the room that we

1912
02:14:15,340 --> 02:14:17,283
know is iffy last.

1913
02:14:17,283 --> 02:14:21,133
SAM: Okay. So wait, we're checking all the rooms
that are probably okay?

1914
02:14:21,133 --> 02:14:23,586
TALIESIN: Yes. I'm going to start upstairs, check
the bedrooms.

1915
02:14:23,586 --> 02:14:26,156
LIAM: You mean the not okay part being the
teleportation room?

1916
02:14:26,156 --> 02:14:26,929
SAM and TALIESIN: Yes.

1917
02:14:26,929 --> 02:14:30,388
MATT: What's up, Pike?

1918
02:14:30,388 --> 02:14:33,012
ASHLEY: Can I cast Spirit Guardians to be around
us?

1919
02:14:33,012 --> 02:14:37,502
MATT: You can. What is the duration on that one?

1920
02:14:37,502 --> 02:14:40,013
ASHLEY: Ten minutes.

1921
02:14:40,013 --> 02:14:41,548
MATT: Yeah, you can do that.

1922
02:14:41,548 --> 02:14:42,825
LAURA: Nice.

1923
02:14:42,825 --> 02:14:49,255
MATT: So, as you guys are walking in, Pike clasps
her holy symbol and closes her eyes for a second

1924
02:14:49,255 --> 02:14:54,665
and you begin to see these almost glowing orbs,
like these ghostly entities that begin to swirl

1925
02:14:54,665 --> 02:15:02,668
and follow around you. Similar in the spirit stuff
of Pike's form when she was alongside you guys in

1926
02:15:02,668 --> 02:15:05,784
Whitestone. Who's heading upstairs?

1927
02:15:05,784 --> 02:15:07,555
SAM: I'll go upstairs with Percy.

1928
02:15:07,555 --> 02:15:08,523
TALIESIN: Sure.

1929
02:15:08,523 --> 02:15:09,599
TRAVIS: Anybody else?

1930
02:15:09,599 --> 02:15:10,779
LAURA: Sure, I'll go upstairs, too.

1931
02:15:10,779 --> 02:15:12,248
MARISHA: Is there a downstairs? Like a cellar?

1932
02:15:12,248 --> 02:15:16,575
MATT: The downstairs would be the path that you
found last time.

1933
02:15:16,575 --> 02:15:18,181
LIAM: And that's it?

1934
02:15:18,181 --> 02:15:21,952
MATT: You didn't inspect the rest of the house at
that point.

1935
02:15:21,952 --> 02:15:23,340
LAURA: There's lots of downstairs rooms.

1936
02:15:23,340 --> 02:15:27,083
TALIESIN: We should remind everyone you are immune
to poison, you are immune to cursed, you've got a

1937
02:15:27,083 --> 02:15:31,531
bonus on wisdom saving throws, and plus 1d10
temporary hitpoints.

1938
02:15:31,531 --> 02:15:36,163
MARISHA: That's from the Heroes' Feast?

1939
02:15:36,163 --> 02:15:37,664
SAM: Poison, charm-- what was it?

1940
02:15:37,664 --> 02:15:38,826
TALIESIN: Curse.

1941
02:15:38,826 --> 02:15:40,437
MARISHA: Let me remember them all.

1942
02:15:40,437 --> 02:15:44,790
TRAVIS: All right, well, you guys go upstairs and
we'll clear out this floor before we go anywhere

1943
02:15:44,790 --> 02:15:46,787
else and we'll wait for you to come back down.

1944
02:15:46,787 --> 02:15:50,147
MARISHA: I'll stay on the middle floor. I'll be
team middle floor.

1945
02:15:50,147 --> 02:15:55,580
MATT: Okay. As Vex, Scanlan, and Percy head
towards the stairway, they step across the red

1946
02:15:55,580 --> 02:15:58,807
carpet in the center of the foyer-- I need all
three of you to make a dexterity saving throw.

1947
02:15:58,807 --> 02:16:02,472
LAURA: Oh, I didn't say perception, shit balls.

1948
02:16:02,472 --> 02:16:05,389
SAM: Dexterity, huh?

1949
02:16:05,389 --> 02:16:06,330
MATT: Correct.

1950
02:16:06,330 --> 02:16:07,442
LAURA: Natural 20!

1951
02:16:07,442 --> 02:16:08,394
MATT: Nice.

1952
02:16:08,394 --> 02:16:09,634
TALIESIN: 24.

1953
02:16:09,634 --> 02:16:11,429
SAM: 12.

1954
02:16:11,429 --> 02:16:19,434
MATT: (laughs) Okay, as you all step across,
there's a sudden smell of-- you've smelled it

1955
02:16:19,434 --> 02:16:28,162
before-- it's the fresh strike of a lightning bolt
or something that has burned in the atmosphere.

1956
02:16:28,162 --> 02:16:32,726
You look over at Percy and both of you feel this
slight bit of tension and energy in the room and

1957
02:16:32,726 --> 02:16:36,981
you dodge out of the way. At which point,
suddenly, there is a burst of force energy from

1958
02:16:36,981 --> 02:16:41,659
the center of the room that surrounds Scanlan,
blasting him in the process and you feel like

1959
02:16:41,659 --> 02:16:46,457
you're lifted off your feet but instead of being
thrown upwards, you slam into what feels like a

1960
02:16:46,457 --> 02:17:01,856
roof that's far too low for the one you've seen.
You go ahead and take 16 points of force damage

1961
02:17:01,856 --> 02:17:07,846
and you land (impact) on the ground, prone.
You look up around you and there is a cage of

1962
02:17:07,846 --> 02:17:11,936
arcane force energy right now that is holding you
in place in a ten by ten foot area.

1963
02:17:11,936 --> 02:17:16,061
(crackling).

1964
02:17:16,061 --> 02:17:18,509
LIAM: They didn't make it out of the room, right?
This is in the room that we're all in?

1965
02:17:18,509 --> 02:17:20,691
MATT: This is in the foyer. You guys just now
went, "All right, we're doing this, go!"

1966
02:17:20,691 --> 02:17:23,365
(impact) It's not even two steps into your plan.

1967
02:17:23,365 --> 02:17:24,905
MARISHA: So we're all still there, we can see
him?

1968
02:17:24,905 --> 02:17:27,440
MATT: Yeah, you all see Scanlan currently now
trapped in this force cage.

1969
02:17:27,440 --> 02:17:31,280
TALIESIN: Full on Ghostbuster-ing. Don't mime,
don't mime.

1970
02:17:31,325 --> 02:17:32,434
SAM: Well.

1971
02:17:32,434 --> 02:17:37,028
MARISHA: Hang on, hang on. Let's just leave him
for a minute. Let's just leave him. Can we leave

1972
02:17:37,028 --> 02:17:40,865
him? I can fix this. I could fix it, (whispers)
but why don't we leave him?

1973
02:17:40,865 --> 02:17:43,315
MATT: Scanlan, roll another dexterity check

1974
02:17:43,315 --> 02:17:47,504
SAM: Oh shit, it's closing on me, isn't it?
Natural 20.

1975
02:17:47,504 --> 02:17:54,756
MATT: Okay. You can see the cage itself, its
unstable energy occasionally arcs across like a

1976
02:17:54,756 --> 02:17:59,414
Tesla coil and you manage to dodge
out of the way and you can see now this cage not

1977
02:17:59,414 --> 02:18:05,483
just holds you in place, but it also perpetually
tries to damage those who are captured.

1978
02:18:05,483 --> 02:18:08,237
MARISHA: Oh, I feel a little bad. I'll let him
out. Dispel Magic.

1979
02:18:08,237 --> 02:18:09,616
SAM: Oh! You've got that!

1980
02:18:09,616 --> 02:18:11,050
MARISHA: I did today.

1981
02:18:11,050 --> 02:18:15,058
MATT: As Keyleth waves her hand now the entire
force cage vanishes into the air.

1982
02:18:15,058 --> 02:18:18,844
SAM: Did you guys see that? I was like in an
aquarium.

1983
02:18:18,844 --> 02:18:21,272
MARISHA: It was kind of fun to watch, I'm not
going to lie.

1984
02:18:21,272 --> 02:18:23,331
TRAVIS: Yeah, you were like a dick in a box.

1985
02:18:23,331 --> 02:18:28,120
SAM: More of a globe, but yeah, no, that works.

1986
02:18:28,120 --> 02:18:29,923
(laughter)

1987
02:18:29,923 --> 02:18:33,022
ASHLEY: Oh wow.

1988
02:18:33,022 --> 02:18:34,959
LIAM: Wow.

1989
02:18:35,003 --> 02:18:37,591
SAM: (singing) Step one. Let's go.

1990
02:18:37,591 --> 02:18:43,656
TALIESIN: Gently checking for traps as we go up
the stairs.

1991
02:18:43,656 --> 02:18:46,306
SAM: Thank you Keyleth, I take it back about your
breath.

1992
02:18:46,306 --> 02:18:49,246
MATT: I will say for the purposes of this,
everyone roll an investigation check.

1993
02:18:49,246 --> 02:18:51,981
SAM: Everyone who's going upstairs?

1994
02:18:51,981 --> 02:18:54,408
MATT: Everyone roll an investigation check. This
is investigation.

1995
02:18:54,408 --> 02:18:55,360
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

1996
02:18:55,360 --> 02:18:56,494
SAM: 28.

1997
02:18:56,494 --> 02:18:57,707
LAURA: (laughs) 14.

1998
02:18:57,707 --> 02:19:03,232
MATT: Okay. The three of you going upstairs: you
find no further traps, you go through the rooms on

1999
02:19:03,232 --> 02:19:07,352
the top floor. You find that where previously most
of them were empty, a lot of them have been

2000
02:19:07,352 --> 02:19:11,778
furnished now but most of the furnishings have
been untouched, like the house was being set up to

2001
02:19:11,778 --> 02:19:16,948
be almost like a summer home or a side home, but
no signs of life; everything seems to have the

2002
02:19:16,948 --> 02:19:23,366
same layer of dust you found on the floor in the
foyer. There is no real wealth being kept here,

2003
02:19:23,366 --> 02:19:28,012
'cause I know that's probably what you're looking
for. It looks like whoever had intended to, this

2004
02:19:28,012 --> 02:19:33,760
collector, hadn't quite gotten to the point of
wanting to move any of their fortune, their

2005
02:19:33,760 --> 02:19:35,494
masses, into the upstairs area.

2006
02:19:35,494 --> 02:19:36,512
LAURA: All right.

2007
02:19:36,512 --> 02:19:39,634
MATT: But it has been largely untouched for a
number of months.

2008
02:19:39,634 --> 02:19:40,751
SAM: So we go down.

2009
02:19:40,751 --> 02:19:42,929
MATT: Now what did you roll?

2010
02:19:42,929 --> 02:19:44,556
MARISHA: I rolled 14.

2011
02:19:44,556 --> 02:19:46,648
LIAM: Oh, 11.

2012
02:19:46,648 --> 02:19:47,989
MATT: Grog?

2013
02:19:47,989 --> 02:19:49,327
TRAVIS: Oh, 11.

2014
02:19:49,327 --> 02:19:50,369
MATT: Pike?

2015
02:19:50,369 --> 02:19:51,137
ASHLEY: 13.

2016
02:19:51,137 --> 02:19:59,622
MATT: Okay. You guys take a little while to pore
through the kitchen, you find a basement, you open

2017
02:19:59,622 --> 02:20:04,075
the latch and go down and look throughout and it
smells mildewed down there, but from general

2018
02:20:04,075 --> 02:20:10,990
dampness, almost like recent rainy weather soaked
into the ground soil there and was left to mildew

2019
02:20:10,990 --> 02:20:20,135
a bit. You don't find any other signs of life,
looking about all the rooms. You find the music

2020
02:20:20,135 --> 02:20:26,280
room, there's the main living den area; mostly
it's almost like a showroom like everything was

2021
02:20:26,280 --> 02:20:30,529
set up but then never had the chance to actually
host anyone or someone to actually live there and

2022
02:20:30,529 --> 02:20:31,799
enjoy it.

2023
02:20:31,799 --> 02:20:39,065
MARISHA: Are there any further signs like the feast
of people leaving in a hurry? That seems like

2024
02:20:39,065 --> 02:20:42,788
someone was here and left really fast? A suitcase,
or--?

2025
02:20:42,788 --> 02:20:48,594
MATT: From what you can tell, the meal that was
prepared, the pots and pans and stuff that were

2026
02:20:48,594 --> 02:20:55,959
used to cook it are currently in a small basin
that carries a little bit of still water that's

2027
02:20:55,959 --> 02:21:01,020
been slowly evaporating over time with bits of
dried food crusted around the sides. The meal

2028
02:21:01,020 --> 02:21:05,566
itself appears to have been abandoned not in
haste, there's no signs of a struggle, the fork is

2029
02:21:05,566 --> 02:21:10,375
still resting partially in the now mushroom
fungus-covered pile. Even getting near it you're

2030
02:21:10,375 --> 02:21:12,535
still like (disgusted grunt) but there's no
previous sign of a struggle.

2031
02:21:12,535 --> 02:21:14,131
ASHLEY: How big was the feast?

2032
02:21:14,131 --> 02:21:18,291
MATT: It looked like it was just made for one
person.

2033
02:21:18,291 --> 02:21:21,084
TALIESIN: Interesting.

2034
02:21:21,084 --> 02:21:26,460
TRAVIS: Are there any, like, sculptures? Or pieces
of art downstairs? Or desks?

2035
02:21:26,460 --> 02:21:33,890
MATT: Actually, there are a number of rather
garish tapestries around. A number of them are of

2036
02:21:33,890 --> 02:21:38,159
different animals running and hunting and chasing,
not in a very beautiful way, but the kind that

2037
02:21:38,159 --> 02:21:40,196
you'd, you know, find at an airport.

2038
02:21:40,196 --> 02:21:45,193
TRAVIS: Like the Denver airport?

2039
02:21:45,193 --> 02:21:47,215
MATT: You know, like Kinkade "Burst of Light."

2040
02:21:47,215 --> 02:21:49,963
TALIESIN: Wow, you paint a picture there.

2041
02:21:49,963 --> 02:21:57,990
MATT: Yeah. They're all thematic and similar and
none of them seem to have any other theme other

2042
02:21:57,990 --> 02:22:00,536
than whoever ordered them seems to like animals.

2043
02:22:00,536 --> 02:22:05,234
TALIESIN: No historical acts, no mythology, nothing
like that?

2044
02:22:05,234 --> 02:22:07,203
MATT: No, not in this current setup.

2045
02:22:07,203 --> 02:22:09,800
MARISHA: Can I Detect Magic on any of them?

2046
02:22:09,800 --> 02:22:14,393
MATT: Okay, you scoot through and using-- do you
have Detect Magic memorized?

2047
02:22:14,393 --> 02:22:18,683
MARISHA: No. I wanted to arcane it.

2048
02:22:18,683 --> 02:22:23,451
MATT: Then make an arcana check to inspect and see if
you see any signs of--

2049
02:22:23,451 --> 02:22:24,935
MARISHA: I'm not good at it.

2050
02:22:24,935 --> 02:22:26,556
LIAM: Still mildly hungover.

2051
02:22:26,556 --> 02:22:29,056
MARISHA: Yeah, still really hungover. 14.

2052
02:22:29,056 --> 02:22:34,964
MATT: 14. Going from place to place, nothing seems
to jump out at you as enchanted or any sort of

2053
02:22:34,964 --> 02:22:40,249
arcane nature. The only room you haven't inspected
yet is the hallway across from the foyer, the one

2054
02:22:40,249 --> 02:22:45,504
that led into the original gallery room and then
into the hidden--

2055
02:22:45,504 --> 02:22:46,933
TRAVIS: The funhouse.

2056
02:22:46,933 --> 02:22:48,075
SAM: Let's all go.

2057
02:22:48,075 --> 02:22:50,797
TRAVIS: Should we check the fucking carpet?

2058
02:22:50,797 --> 02:22:52,480
MARISHA: I say yeah.

2059
02:22:52,480 --> 02:22:57,027
LAURA: Yeah, teleportation circle. Remember there
were a shitton of traps before we got to it.

2060
02:22:57,027 --> 02:22:58,426
MATT: What's up, Pike?

2061
02:22:58,426 --> 02:23:04,255
ASHLEY: Can I do a religion check to see if
there's any Vecna stuff here?

2062
02:23:04,255 --> 02:23:05,914
LAURA: Yeah, smart move.

2063
02:23:05,914 --> 02:23:09,130
MATT: Yeah, make a religion check.

2064
02:23:09,130 --> 02:23:14,001
ASHLEY: 20.

2065
02:23:14,001 --> 02:23:17,766
MATT: Okay. Looking about and keeping this in
mind, you don't see any sort of religious

2066
02:23:17,766 --> 02:23:25,451
iconography. Any of the artwork, any of the small
knickknacks that are throughout the den, nothing

2067
02:23:25,451 --> 02:23:30,898
here speaks of any sort of religious connotation,
or at least whoever has decorated this place did

2068
02:23:30,898 --> 02:23:37,480
so purely out of visual aesthetic choice. So yeah,
nothing catches your attention in this room.

2069
02:23:37,480 --> 02:23:39,608
ASHLEY: Okay.

2070
02:23:39,608 --> 02:23:41,497
MATT: All right.

2071
02:23:41,497 --> 02:23:44,309
SAM: Let's go. Who's going first? Pike?

2072
02:23:44,309 --> 02:23:45,665
ASHLEY: Sure!

2073
02:23:45,665 --> 02:23:46,814
LIAM: Pike then Grog?

2074
02:23:46,814 --> 02:23:52,155
MATT: All right. Pike, Grog-- what's the rest of
the marching order here?

2075
02:23:52,155 --> 02:23:55,346
LAURA: Trinket, then me.

2076
02:23:55,346 --> 02:24:00,534
TALIESIN: Then me.

2077
02:24:00,534 --> 02:24:02,421
MATT: Then Percy.

2078
02:24:02,421 --> 02:24:04,033
TRAVIS: Does Pike get a cloak?

2079
02:24:04,033 --> 02:24:05,533
MARISHA: I guess me.

2080
02:24:05,533 --> 02:24:09,162
SAM: Then Vax's wardrobe rack, then me.

2081
02:24:09,162 --> 02:24:11,605
LIAM: No, it's got to go behind, I have to pull it
behind.

2082
02:24:11,605 --> 02:24:13,232
MATT: All right. So--

2083
02:24:13,232 --> 02:24:15,047
ASHLEY: Do I get that invisibility cloak again?

2084
02:24:15,047 --> 02:24:16,725
LIAM: No.

2085
02:24:16,725 --> 02:24:18,786
(laughter)

2086
02:24:18,786 --> 02:24:26,507
MATT: All right, you guys step through, it's a
short hallway and it leads you into a 20x80 long

2087
02:24:26,507 --> 02:24:31,741
room, and here you do see a number of tapestries,
and there are the ones that were left previously,

2088
02:24:31,741 --> 02:24:37,991
actually. This room has not really been touched
much since you came in when Krieg currently lived

2089
02:24:37,991 --> 02:24:42,865
here. You can see these tapestries are much older,
these ones depict more mythological moments. One

2090
02:24:42,865 --> 02:24:51,218
of them shows the elemental creation of existence.
It's almost like a biblical-type very artistic

2091
02:24:51,218 --> 02:24:54,684
representation of the creation of the different
planes. You've seen it done before--

2092
02:24:54,684 --> 02:24:56,509
MARISHA: Is that the same one that was here last
time?

2093
02:24:56,509 --> 02:25:05,443
MATT: Yeah. Yeah, same one. There are a number of
small cylindrical platforms that rise up in the

2094
02:25:05,443 --> 02:25:13,311
center of this room. You see on the first sets a
series of bronze busts of a particular man wearing

2095
02:25:13,311 --> 02:25:20,101
a cloth wrap, a headpiece. His features are still
nondescript. There's a lot of detail in the

2096
02:25:20,101 --> 02:25:26,321
clothing, in the neck wrap and the head wrap. But
when it comes to the actual features of the face

2097
02:25:26,321 --> 02:25:29,038
it's very simple and plain.

2098
02:25:29,038 --> 02:25:31,207
LIAM: Not enough to recognize anything.

2099
02:25:31,207 --> 02:25:34,040
LAURA: Kind of like a god of secrets?

2100
02:25:34,040 --> 02:25:40,678
MATT: No. I'm actually going to ask you guys to
roll a history check.

2101
02:25:40,723 --> 02:25:46,329
SAM: 22.

2102
02:25:46,329 --> 02:25:47,469
TALIESIN: 26.

2103
02:25:47,469 --> 02:25:50,034
LAURA: What is this, history?

2104
02:25:50,034 --> 02:25:51,371
MARISHA: 20.

2105
02:25:51,427 --> 02:25:56,034
LAURA: 21.

2106
02:25:56,034 --> 02:26:04,373
MATT: All righty. So, glancing at this, the three
of you-- you don't recognize the face at all. And

2107
02:26:04,373 --> 02:26:10,778
the best that you can recall is there have been
tales in a far-off continent called Marquet, which

2108
02:26:10,778 --> 02:26:19,839
is a largely desert landscape. The few
bastions of civilization that exist in this

2109
02:26:19,839 --> 02:26:26,194
desert, there is one central town, referred to as
Ank'Harel. You've never been there. You've heard

2110
02:26:26,194 --> 02:26:29,374
of it. And it's this little oasis in this center of
this vast desert.

2111
02:26:29,374 --> 02:26:30,849
LAURA: Oh! Oh! Wait!

2112
02:26:30,849 --> 02:26:31,794
MARISHA: Yeah.

2113
02:26:31,794 --> 02:26:33,602
LAURA: That's where Riskel was going to go.

2114
02:26:33,602 --> 02:26:37,260
MATT: It's also where Jarett is from.

2115
02:26:37,260 --> 02:26:40,470
SAM: Jarett's a mole, kill him.

2116
02:26:40,470 --> 02:26:53,901
MATT: And you've heard that the city has been
lorded over and run in a very benevolent way by an

2117
02:26:53,901 --> 02:27:02,386
individual referred to as J'mon Sa Ord. The city
has existed for about 400 years, and since its

2118
02:27:02,386 --> 02:27:09,440
existence has been run by J'mon Sa Ord. People
don't know if he's human, what he is. But he's

2119
02:27:09,440 --> 02:27:11,226
apparently lived that long.

2120
02:27:11,226 --> 02:27:12,738
LAURA: How long? I didn't hear because I was
writing.

2121
02:27:12,738 --> 02:27:13,966
MATT: 400 years.

2122
02:27:13,966 --> 02:27:24,502
MATT: But the most that you've heard about J'mon
is: human, but his features are hard to make out.

2123
02:27:24,502 --> 02:27:29,101
Like even to look into his face still seems like
you can't focus.

2124
02:27:29,101 --> 02:27:31,446
LIAM: That doesn't sound good.

2125
02:27:31,446 --> 02:27:37,454
MATT: That's as much as you can assert. And those
thoughts come to you three and you see this bust,

2126
02:27:37,454 --> 02:27:42,937
these series of busts that seem to depict this
individual, and to the best of your knowledge

2127
02:27:42,937 --> 02:27:48,467
that's probably an artist's depiction of J'mon Sa
Ord. Which you've never seen in Tal'Dorei. Or

2128
02:27:48,467 --> 02:27:50,525
anything of this type of construct.

2129
02:27:50,525 --> 02:27:55,747
LAURA: But we know that that's where Riskel wanted
to go as well. I want to pull out the symbol of

2130
02:27:55,747 --> 02:27:58,933
Vecna that I took off of Riskel and--

2131
02:27:58,933 --> 02:28:00,225
MATT: Okay.

2132
02:28:00,225 --> 02:28:03,931
MARISHA: I feel like we might've-- I feel like
that's not also the first time we've heard of

2133
02:28:03,931 --> 02:28:05,090
Ank'Harel.

2134
02:28:05,090 --> 02:28:06,669
LAURA: Well Jarett's from there.

2135
02:28:06,669 --> 02:28:10,520
MARISHA: I feel like even before then, like a long
time ago.

2136
02:28:10,520 --> 02:28:12,692
LIAM: Can I check for traps while they're
talking?

2137
02:28:12,692 --> 02:28:13,752
MATT: Sure, make a perception check.

2138
02:28:13,752 --> 02:28:15,405
MARISHA: Marquet is the continent? Correct?

2139
02:28:15,405 --> 02:28:16,341
MATT: Correct, yes.

2140
02:28:16,341 --> 02:28:17,971
MARISHA: And Ank'Harel is a city within the
continent.

2141
02:28:17,971 --> 02:28:19,333
LIAM: 20.

2142
02:28:19,333 --> 02:28:21,509
MARISHA: It's like a desert continent? The whole
continent is like desert?

2143
02:28:21,509 --> 02:28:22,740
MATT: Desert and mountains.

2144
02:28:22,740 --> 02:28:23,960
MARISHA: So it's like Australia?

2145
02:28:23,960 --> 02:28:31,015
MATT: (laughs) Looking about, there are no traps
in this room. It looks to be pretty clean, pretty

2146
02:28:31,015 --> 02:28:36,274
clear. Also, you see on the pillars there are a few
other things. There is a golden tea set made of

2147
02:28:36,274 --> 02:28:42,898
pure gold on one of the pillars. There is a
mostly-- and very old-looking set-- not complete

2148
02:28:42,898 --> 02:28:51,558
set of ivory-carved dominoes. There's a human
skull-- humanoid skull-- doesn't quite look human.

2149
02:28:51,558 --> 02:28:57,805
It looks elongated and the teeth are
sharpened. Looks almost elvish. But one eye

2150
02:28:57,805 --> 02:29:01,379
socket has an uncut rough emerald embedded in the
socket.

2151
02:29:01,379 --> 02:29:02,445
MARISHA: Which one?

2152
02:29:02,445 --> 02:29:03,475
MATT: The right socket.

2153
02:29:03,475 --> 02:29:08,031
SAM: That's straight-up Goonies.

2154
02:29:08,031 --> 02:29:10,498
This place has been pilfered before and no
one took that.

2155
02:29:10,498 --> 02:29:12,629
TRAVIS: I go over to the dominoes.

2156
02:29:12,629 --> 02:29:17,038
TALIESIN: I'm going to examine the skull.

2157
02:29:17,038 --> 02:29:19,941
MARISHA: I'm going to help Percy examine the
skull.

2158
02:29:19,941 --> 02:29:24,196
MATT: Okay, are you just taking a look at it?

2159
02:29:24,196 --> 02:29:28,453
TALIESIN: I'm taking a look at it, I'm checking to
see if it's attached to the-- it's sitting on a

2160
02:29:28,453 --> 02:29:29,698
column at the moment?

2161
02:29:29,698 --> 02:29:31,552
MATT: It's sitting on one of the columns, yeah.
It's part of the collection.

2162
02:29:31,552 --> 02:29:36,731
TALIESIN: I'm seeing if it's attached at all and
very gently turning it if I don't see any--

2163
02:29:36,731 --> 02:29:41,764
MATT: As you reach out take it and its weight and
you lift it off the cylindrical pillar--

2164
02:29:41,764 --> 02:29:48,611
TALIESIN: I was just going to turn it. I wasn't
quite going to lift it yet.

2165
02:29:48,611 --> 02:29:50,666
MATT: As you turn it, it turns freely.

2166
02:29:50,666 --> 02:29:54,866
TALIESIN: All right, I give it a little lift.

2167
02:29:54,866 --> 02:30:03,877
MATT: You lift it up off of the pillar and on that.
As you do that... nothing happens. It is in your

2168
02:30:03,877 --> 02:30:05,205
hands. However--

2169
02:30:05,205 --> 02:30:06,390
SAM: Everyone dies.

2170
02:30:06,390 --> 02:30:10,206
MATT: Yeah. It's heavier than you expected it
would be and--

2171
02:30:10,263 --> 02:30:13,560
TALIESIN: Oh god, it's going to talk to me, isn't
it?

2172
02:30:13,560 --> 02:30:19,881
MATT: There's a part of you that-- like a slight
cold chill runs down your spine.

2173
02:30:19,881 --> 02:30:22,431
TALIESIN: A recognizable cold chill, or a
brand-new cold chill?

2174
02:30:22,431 --> 02:30:28,647
MATT: No, just like every person has that little
part in the back of their head that says, "This

2175
02:30:28,647 --> 02:30:33,004
"probably isn't a good idea, but whatever."

2176
02:30:33,004 --> 02:30:35,660
(laughter)

2177
02:30:35,660 --> 02:30:37,575
TALIESIN: I hate you so much!

2178
02:30:37,575 --> 02:30:39,384
MATT: So, you're holding it in your hand, what do
you want to do?

2179
02:30:39,384 --> 02:30:40,845
LIAM: You're like a magnet for evil.

2180
02:30:40,845 --> 02:30:48,055
TALIESIN: I'm a little evil magnet, I know. I'm
checking, is the emerald set into the socket or is

2181
02:30:48,055 --> 02:30:49,312
it removable?

2182
02:30:49,312 --> 02:30:52,167
MATT: It's set in the socket, actually, and the
emerald-- go ahead and make a perception check.

2183
02:30:52,167 --> 02:30:56,212
TALIESIN: All right. Natural 20.

2184
02:30:56,212 --> 02:31:02,615
MATT: All right. Glancing into the socket, you can
see the emerald is actually set within the socket.

2185
02:31:02,615 --> 02:31:11,891
It is set with meticulously jewel-crafted gold
inlay that actually almost looks like a very

2186
02:31:11,891 --> 02:31:18,993
deepset filigree that binds it within the socket
itself, like it's very deliberately placed. The

2187
02:31:18,993 --> 02:31:24,701
craftsmanship of the very, very fine gold
filigree, and yet the uncut nature of the emerald,

2188
02:31:24,701 --> 02:31:30,250
seems strange and as you inspect the emerald
itself, it seems almost like while the gem itself

2189
02:31:30,250 --> 02:31:38,643
is stationary, there is the ever-so-faint image of
movement within the gem. Almost like a freshly

2190
02:31:38,643 --> 02:31:44,201
disturbed pond, like a slight ripple of the
surface of water, there is just ever-so-slowly

2191
02:31:44,201 --> 02:31:47,185
shifting within the gem.

2192
02:31:47,185 --> 02:31:50,992
TALIESIN: I think I've found something evil.

2193
02:31:50,992 --> 02:31:53,439
LAURA: Maybe you should not be touching it.

2194
02:31:53,439 --> 02:31:58,759
MARISHA: Yeah, can I do a nature check to see if I
can recognize what kind of skull it might be?

2195
02:31:58,759 --> 02:31:59,896
MATT: Sure.

2196
02:31:59,896 --> 02:32:03,481
MARISHA: 17.

2197
02:32:03,481 --> 02:32:09,378
MATT: The skull does not come from any beast that
you are familiar with, you've not encountered a

2198
02:32:09,378 --> 02:32:14,641
creature of this physiology, and it definitely
doesn't come from the realm of nature from your

2199
02:32:14,641 --> 02:32:15,429
understanding.

2200
02:32:15,429 --> 02:32:18,047
LIAM: Pike, don't you think you should have a look
at it?

2201
02:32:18,047 --> 02:32:20,746
ASHLEY: Yeah, can I give it a-- what do you see
inside the gem?

2202
02:32:20,746 --> 02:32:31,038
TALIESIN: It's like a ripple, almost like a pond
that's just gently disturbed. Oh. I have a thought.

2203
02:32:31,038 --> 02:32:32,376
MARISHA: What?

2204
02:32:32,376 --> 02:32:37,169
TALIESIN: This is precisely the sort of awful
thing that I would design if I wanted a way to

2205
02:32:37,169 --> 02:32:44,393
look into a hallway. I'm going to place it back on
the column, facing the wall.

2206
02:32:44,393 --> 02:32:45,758
MATT: Okay.

2207
02:32:45,758 --> 02:32:50,725
SAM: Pike, do you want to look at it further?

2208
02:32:50,725 --> 02:32:54,666
ASHLEY: Yeah, can I give it a look? I want to look
at the tea set too.

2209
02:32:54,666 --> 02:32:56,169
LAURA: I know, I want to go look at the tea set.

2210
02:32:56,169 --> 02:32:57,903
LIAM: Let's look at the evil skull first.

2211
02:32:57,903 --> 02:33:01,293
ASHLEY: Can I do a check?

2212
02:33:01,293 --> 02:33:03,794
MATT: Okay, so what are you trying to check about
the skull?

2213
02:33:03,794 --> 02:33:10,532
ASHLEY: I don't know, like if it's-- I don't know.
I don't know what to check.

2214
02:33:10,532 --> 02:33:12,674
TRAVIS: If it's evil?

2215
02:33:12,674 --> 02:33:14,801
LAURA: Is that like an arcana check or--?

2216
02:33:14,801 --> 02:33:18,059
MATT: Well, it depends on what nature you're
trying to ascertain of the skull. Are you trying

2217
02:33:18,059 --> 02:33:18,854
to figure--

2218
02:33:18,854 --> 02:33:22,893
ASHLEY: Yeah well I want to check if it's evil,
but I don't know. It seems like it is.

2219
02:33:22,893 --> 02:33:25,247
LIAM: I mean, we've been talking about--

2220
02:33:25,247 --> 02:33:27,161
MATT: There are spells called Detect Good and
Evil.

2221
02:33:27,198 --> 02:33:30,758
LIAM: -- some fucknut with one eye. I feel like--

2222
02:33:30,758 --> 02:33:32,188
SAM: Oh, it's Vecna?

2223
02:33:32,188 --> 02:33:35,344
MARISHA: It's the left eye. He said it's in its
right eye.

2224
02:33:35,344 --> 02:33:38,194
LAURA: Still, then its left eye is empty.

2225
02:33:38,194 --> 02:33:42,435
ASHLEY: I have it, I have it, I have it, I have
it! Let me do that.

2226
02:33:42,435 --> 02:33:43,512
MATT: You have it memorized?

2227
02:33:43,512 --> 02:33:45,178
ASHLEY: Yep, it's right in here.

2228
02:33:45,178 --> 02:33:52,593
MATT: Okay. All right. So. As per the spell, let
me get the rules up here real fast. Because the

2229
02:33:52,593 --> 02:33:57,833
question comes up often, if you want this app on
your phone, it's called Fight Club 5. On the

2230
02:33:57,833 --> 02:34:02,831
iTunes store for free. You have to do some
updates and uploading of your own, you can find

2231
02:34:02,831 --> 02:34:11,155
information on the web on how to do it but that
way you know and stop tweeting me. I don't mind,

2232
02:34:11,155 --> 02:34:20,056
it's fine. All right, so. Detect Good and Evil.
Evil and Good. All right, so. You take a moment

2233
02:34:20,056 --> 02:34:23,925
and you focus-- by the way, this is a
concentration spell, doing this will get rid of

2234
02:34:23,925 --> 02:34:25,238
your spirit guardians.

2235
02:34:25,238 --> 02:34:29,231
ASHLEY: Okay. I think that's okay. I think--
that's fine.

2236
02:34:29,231 --> 02:34:34,471
MATT: Okay. So as the orbs that have been rotating
around for the past, you know, it's been about ten

2237
02:34:34,471 --> 02:34:38,338
minutes, they probably would have faded anyway,
gently dissipate, you focus your intent on the

2238
02:34:38,338 --> 02:34:48,282
skull, and this object, while it is not a
desecrated object per se, there is an essence

2239
02:34:48,282 --> 02:34:59,621
inside that does not strike you as moral. There is
something about its very nature that does give you

2240
02:34:59,621 --> 02:35:04,928
pause. You are unable to ascertain the nature,
given the fact that you would have to take some

2241
02:35:04,928 --> 02:35:15,413
time with it to really do so, but you get the
feeling that there is some power within it, but

2242
02:35:15,413 --> 02:35:22,907
probably not the kind that is very fortuitous for
someone of your persuasion.

2243
02:35:22,907 --> 02:35:27,027
ASHLEY: Okay. I think it's bad.

2244
02:35:27,027 --> 02:35:29,649
TRAVIS: You think it's bad?

2245
02:35:29,649 --> 02:35:32,298
ASHLEY: Let's have it face the wall. I don't want
it looking at us.

2246
02:35:32,298 --> 02:35:35,736
LAURA: Can I go take the top off the tea set and
look inside?

2247
02:35:35,736 --> 02:35:39,926
MATT: Yeah. You go ahead and take the top off the
tea set and look inside; it is empty, it is

2248
02:35:39,926 --> 02:35:46,575
polished, and the light that comes in as you open
the top just refracts the image from the outside

2249
02:35:46,575 --> 02:35:53,381
of the tea set, and it's just beautiful
craftsmanship. The actual gold itself is very

2250
02:35:53,381 --> 02:35:59,169
smooth on most of the tea kettle, and all the cups
themselves all have very very intricate scrolling

2251
02:35:59,169 --> 02:36:03,959
on them that have been handcarved in; it's a
beautiful set. This is like a royal gift. This is

2252
02:36:03,959 --> 02:36:10,041
something that, you know, people who trade across
political boundaries use to, you know, send

2253
02:36:10,041 --> 02:36:12,944
goodwill to the other side. This is probably worth
quite a bit.

2254
02:36:12,944 --> 02:36:16,290
LAURA: Is there any stamping on it to like show
who it's from or anything like that?

2255
02:36:16,290 --> 02:36:21,169
MATT: You look on the bottom and it has the
initials L.M.

2256
02:36:21,169 --> 02:36:25,373
LAURA: L.M. L.M. L.M.

2257
02:36:25,373 --> 02:36:28,747
TRAVIS: Love, Macna.

2258
02:36:28,747 --> 02:36:33,197
MATT: The street cousin of Vecna.

2259
02:36:33,197 --> 02:36:39,058
TALIESIN: I would recommend that if we are going
to... purloin things, we should do it on the way

2260
02:36:39,058 --> 02:36:41,710
out rather than the way in.

2261
02:36:41,710 --> 02:36:43,099
LAURA: Oh. Yeah, definitely.

2262
02:36:43,099 --> 02:36:44,973
TRAVIS: All right, are the dominoes just like on a
table?

2263
02:36:44,973 --> 02:36:47,976
MATT: Yeah, some of them are set on the side,
there's a stack, and then a few of them are set

2264
02:36:47,976 --> 02:36:53,226
up-- it's literally placed in like a nice
presentational like QVC style "turn it and look at

2265
02:36:53,226 --> 02:36:54,891
all the cool dominoes" type.

2266
02:36:54,891 --> 02:36:56,562
TRAVIS: I grab the table and I shake it.

2267
02:36:56,562 --> 02:37:02,283
MATT: Okay. All the dominoes (scattering sound)
scatter and fall off the sides, (clatter sounds)

2268
02:37:02,283 --> 02:37:04,579
and clinking on the ground, some of the ivory
chips a little bit on some of the corners.

2269
02:37:04,579 --> 02:37:06,949
ASHLEY: Grog.

2270
02:37:06,949 --> 02:37:08,288
MATT: Nothing bad seems to happen.

2271
02:37:08,288 --> 02:37:14,350
TRAVIS: I think it's evil. I reach down, I pick up
one of the ivory die.

2272
02:37:14,350 --> 02:37:23,833
MATT: It stands there, cold, against the very
well, you taste it. As your tongue touches the

2273
02:37:23,833 --> 02:37:26,299
ivory of the domino,

2274
02:37:26,299 --> 02:37:28,743
it tastes somewhat salty.

2275
02:37:28,743 --> 02:37:33,306
TRAVIS: I believe it tastes like a domino.

2276
02:37:33,306 --> 02:37:37,177
LAURA: Okay, can we go look at the teleportation
thingy now?

2277
02:37:37,177 --> 02:37:38,385
SAM and TALIESIN: Let's go down.

2278
02:37:38,385 --> 02:37:42,033
MATT: All right. You guys make your way to the far
back wall of the room and there is that same

2279
02:37:42,033 --> 02:37:48,849
tapestry that you saw before, it depicts a large
storm cloud that is roaring over the cliffs.

2280
02:37:48,849 --> 02:37:50,924
SAM: I'm just going to peek behind the tapestry.

2281
02:37:50,924 --> 02:37:52,533
LIAM: There's a door behind there.

2282
02:37:52,533 --> 02:37:54,760
MATT: You open up the tapestry and it's just a
flat stone wall.

2283
02:37:54,760 --> 02:37:56,063
SAM: Okay. Nothing there.

2284
02:37:56,063 --> 02:37:57,317
TRAVIS: Are you sure?

2285
02:37:57,317 --> 02:37:58,695
SAM: I lick the wall.

2286
02:37:58,695 --> 02:38:02,510
MATT: Okay, as you lick the wall your face (wind
sound) passes through the wall.

2287
02:38:02,510 --> 02:38:07,300
(laughter)

2288
02:38:07,300 --> 02:38:08,908
LAURA: Isn't that the same doorway we found
before?

2289
02:38:08,908 --> 02:38:10,983
MARISHA: Yeah, we've already done this once, you
guys, let's not be crazy.

2290
02:38:10,983 --> 02:38:15,589
SAM: I forgot about that. Where'd my face go?!

2291
02:38:15,589 --> 02:38:18,668
TALIESIN: It was just like this last time, except
there was brunch. That's all I remember.

2292
02:38:18,668 --> 02:38:23,386
MATT: As your head passes through, you look about
and you can see stairs that descend for about 40

2293
02:38:23,386 --> 02:38:24,779
feet into darkness.

2294
02:38:24,779 --> 02:38:32,523
LIAM: All right, I grab Scanlan by the scruff and
pull him back and then I start in. And I grab my

2295
02:38:32,523 --> 02:38:35,043
sister by the ear behind me and start pulling her
down.

2296
02:38:35,043 --> 02:38:41,530
MARISHA: So wait, wait. There's the, there's still
the tapestry in front of it?

2297
02:38:41,530 --> 02:38:44,014
MATT: Yeah, there's a tapestry in front of it,
yeah.

2298
02:38:44,014 --> 02:38:52,028
MARISHA: Can I take the tapestry off? The wall? I
want to like take it and put it over my shoulders

2299
02:38:52,028 --> 02:38:55,036
and jump a little.

2300
02:38:55,036 --> 02:38:56,524
SAM: Like make it a parachute?

2301
02:38:56,524 --> 02:38:58,412
MARISHA: Yeah. See if--

2302
02:38:58,412 --> 02:39:00,269
LAURA: Is it flying?

2303
02:39:00,269 --> 02:39:05,185
MATT: Okay, as you take the tapestry and you put
it around, you grab on the ends of it and you jump

2304
02:39:05,185 --> 02:39:12,694
in the air, it jumps with you and lands with you.
It's a very heavy tapestry. Most tapestries, the

2305
02:39:12,694 --> 02:39:16,530
amount of craftsmanship that goes into it, the
material-- this one in particular, it falls very

2306
02:39:16,530 --> 02:39:20,118
very heavily against the wall and doesn't really
gather any air or--

2307
02:39:20,118 --> 02:39:24,468
TALIESIN: In her defense, the last time she tried
this, it did fly away. It's not a flying

2308
02:39:24,468 --> 02:39:25,502
tapestry.

2309
02:39:25,502 --> 02:39:27,285
MARISHA: Yeah. I just thought I'd try.

2310
02:39:27,285 --> 02:39:29,779
LAURA: Maybe just put it over top of that skull
and keep it hidden for now.

2311
02:39:29,779 --> 02:39:32,186
MARISHA: Okay, I take the tapestry and I put it
over the skull.

2312
02:39:32,186 --> 02:39:34,872
MATT: Okay. As you throw the tapestry on top of
the skull--

2313
02:39:34,872 --> 02:39:35,893
MARISHA: Oh boy.

2314
02:39:35,893 --> 02:39:37,948
MATT: Nothing happens.

2315
02:39:37,948 --> 02:39:39,468
TALIESIN: Such an asshole!

2316
02:39:39,468 --> 02:39:43,806
MATT: It's just fun to mess with you guys. All
right, so you guys progress down the stairway?

2317
02:39:43,806 --> 02:39:46,335
LIAM: Perception check, perception check,
perception check.

2318
02:39:46,335 --> 02:39:52,064
LAURA: Oh god, really?

2319
02:39:52,064 --> 02:39:55,384
LIAM: 20 for me.

2320
02:39:55,384 --> 02:39:56,981
TRAVIS: 19.

2321
02:39:56,981 --> 02:39:58,326
LAURA: One!

2322
02:39:58,326 --> 02:40:03,980
MATT: Delight. Glancing in the next room, and this
is a small chamber you guys have seen before, it's

2323
02:40:03,980 --> 02:40:08,790
about 30 feet across, on the far end there is a
small, circular stone platform about six inches

2324
02:40:08,790 --> 02:40:17,193
thick that has deep inset runes carved in a
circular pattern across it. It's less polished

2325
02:40:17,193 --> 02:40:23,426
than the ones you've seen at the Lyceum in Emon,
but it is definitively the last teleportation

2326
02:40:23,476 --> 02:40:31,225
circle you took to the cavern that housed General
Krieg where you had your encounter.

2327
02:40:31,225 --> 02:40:36,623
LIAM: And the last time we were here, I found a
safe path through. Do I remember it?

2328
02:40:36,623 --> 02:40:42,086
MATT: Correct. You actually distinctly recall the
pattern, to the best of your ability.

2329
02:40:42,086 --> 02:40:44,680
LIAM: Up, up, down, down, left, right, left,
right.

2330
02:40:44,680 --> 02:40:47,366
MATT: Now I want you to go ahead and make a wisdom
check.

2331
02:40:47,366 --> 02:40:52,098
MARISHA: You have advantage. No, wait, that's
saving throws. Never mind.

2332
02:40:52,098 --> 02:40:54,578
LAURA: Use Luck.

2333
02:40:54,578 --> 02:40:59,675
LIAM: I could use Luck, yeah. 20.

2334
02:40:59,675 --> 02:41:05,161
MATT: 20. Yeah, you recall the exact pattern
through. Leading the way, stepping from stone to

2335
02:41:05,161 --> 02:41:09,992
stone to stone, you guys following his pattern,
you manage to make your way, all of you, including

2336
02:41:09,992 --> 02:41:13,386
Trinket who has to (bear grunts).

2337
02:41:13,386 --> 02:41:15,023
MARISHA: He remembers.

2338
02:41:15,023 --> 02:41:24,197
MATT: Guide you through. You make your way all the
way across the room to the teleportation circle,

2339
02:41:24,197 --> 02:41:29,745
and this is the end of this portion of the
hallway. What do you wish to do?

2340
02:41:29,745 --> 02:41:31,955
SAM: Do we step onto it? How does it work?

2341
02:41:31,955 --> 02:41:33,160
LAURA: I don't remember.

2342
02:41:33,160 --> 02:41:34,714
TRAVIS: I think we just run ahead.

2343
02:41:34,714 --> 02:41:40,694
LAURA: Wait, does it look like there's been anybody
in here since we left?

2344
02:41:40,694 --> 02:41:44,613
MATT: Go ahead and make a survival check.

2345
02:41:44,613 --> 02:41:45,981
SAM: Survival?

2346
02:41:45,981 --> 02:41:47,231
LIAM: Jeepers.

2347
02:41:47,231 --> 02:41:54,005
LAURA: What in the (popping sound)?! That's my
third one of the night.

2348
02:41:54,005 --> 02:41:57,117
TRAVIS: Can I do that one too? I can survival
stuff pretty well.

2349
02:41:57,117 --> 02:42:02,187
MARISHA: Can I assist Grog in finding if our
footsteps were the last ones out?

2350
02:42:02,187 --> 02:42:10,125
MATT: True, I was giving this more as a means of
giving the trained tracker a better look into

2351
02:42:10,125 --> 02:42:14,468
this. I'll give you a simple perception check as
you're not quite sure.

2352
02:42:14,468 --> 02:42:16,018
TRAVIS: That'll be way worse.

2353
02:42:16,018 --> 02:42:17,203
LIAM: Worse than a natural one?

2354
02:42:17,203 --> 02:42:19,522
MATT: But with Keyleth's help that will give you
advantage.

2355
02:42:19,522 --> 02:42:22,185
TRAVIS: 11.

2356
02:42:22,185 --> 02:42:29,326
MATT: It's hard to tell. This room itself is
pretty dark, the little sconces that hold this low

2357
02:42:29,326 --> 02:42:37,407
flicker of eternal arcane light, they're just
gently flickering on the sides of the walls, in

2358
02:42:37,407 --> 02:42:40,936
the low light it's hard to make out any details of
the ground and for the most part the stonework

2359
02:42:40,936 --> 02:42:42,244
here seems unchanged.

2360
02:42:42,244 --> 02:42:45,664
LAURA: We suck.

2361
02:42:45,664 --> 02:42:48,462
TALIESIN: Are we going onto the teleportation pad
then?

2362
02:42:48,462 --> 02:42:51,478
LIAM: But I think we assume we're walking into
trouble.

2363
02:42:51,478 --> 02:42:55,208
SAM: Trouble is our middles names.

2364
02:42:55,208 --> 02:42:57,506
MARISHA: Well, let's think of what happened last
time we were here.

2365
02:42:57,506 --> 02:43:00,223
SAM: There was a dragon, there was some loot.

2366
02:43:00,223 --> 02:43:01,763
TRAVIS: There was a bunch of gold.

2367
02:43:01,763 --> 02:43:05,588
MARISHA: There was a bunch of gold and there were
three eyes in a wall--

2368
02:43:05,588 --> 02:43:07,211
LAURA and MARISHA: Saying they were coming for
us.

2369
02:43:07,211 --> 02:43:08,935
SAM: Did we crack one of them?

2370
02:43:08,935 --> 02:43:10,783
MARISHA: We did crack one of them. One cracked.

2371
02:43:10,783 --> 02:43:11,930
LAURA: They all cracked.

2372
02:43:11,930 --> 02:43:13,487
MARISHA: But, wait weren't the--

2373
02:43:13,487 --> 02:43:16,305
SAM: Maybe they've reformed.

2374
02:43:16,305 --> 02:43:21,213
MATT: There were four orbs and then one eye showed
up in one of the orbs and then all four cracked.

2375
02:43:21,213 --> 02:43:25,794
TRAVIS: Can't we send like a probe, can't you make
a little person? A little fake little person?

2376
02:43:25,794 --> 02:43:33,101
SAM: I can make a fake person to push something or
lift something, but he won't be able to--

2377
02:43:33,101 --> 02:43:34,582
TRAVIS: He can't take a magic ride?

2378
02:43:34,582 --> 02:43:38,459
MARISHA: These aren't the same gems that were
holding Uriel's family, those were different.

2379
02:43:38,459 --> 02:43:40,041
LAURA: No. These were dragoneye things.

2380
02:43:40,041 --> 02:43:46,952
LIAM: These were palantirs hanging in a wall where
another dragon somewhere peeked through and was

2381
02:43:46,952 --> 02:43:47,912
pissed off.

2382
02:43:47,912 --> 02:43:50,816
LAURA: Let's do it! Let's go through! Pow!

2383
02:43:50,816 --> 02:43:53,648
MATT: Okay. As each one of you step on
individually onto the platform, there's a brief

2384
02:43:53,648 --> 02:43:59,776
moment of the wind beneath your stomach being
lifted and you feel those butterflies hit as

2385
02:43:59,776 --> 02:44:06,399
suddenly your imagery shifts and immediately you
find yourself standing on a similar platform

2386
02:44:06,399 --> 02:44:11,558
elsewhere. As you step off, as you feel force
pushing you forward, as each individual starts

2387
02:44:11,558 --> 02:44:16,861
appearing behind in rapid succession, immediately
you notice the air change to extremely cold.

2388
02:44:16,861 --> 02:44:20,757
MARISHA: That's right, it was in the mountain
cave.

2389
02:44:20,757 --> 02:44:30,275
MATT: Looking around you can see there, directly
near you, there are a few stalagmites with a

2390
02:44:30,275 --> 02:44:38,857
little layer of snow and ice on it and there are a
couple patches of ice that have solidified on

2391
02:44:38,857 --> 02:44:45,225
parts of the floor. Across the way you can see
immediately a large portion of the entire tunnel

2392
02:44:45,225 --> 02:44:52,636
has collapsed. There's just piles of just rocks
and stones that have filled about 60 to 65% of

2393
02:44:52,636 --> 02:45:01,718
what was previously General Krieg, or as you found
the name to be, Bonescythe-- Brimscythe, sorry.

2394
02:45:01,718 --> 02:45:10,555
Brimscythe's chambers. All the rocks have crumbled
onto where the dragon hoard that you were

2395
02:45:10,555 --> 02:45:16,262
rage-looting before, currently resided now just
held beneath the boulders and rocks.

2396
02:45:16,262 --> 02:45:18,902
SAM: Get rid of those rocks?

2397
02:45:18,902 --> 02:45:21,193
MARISHA: I might be able to.

2398
02:45:21,193 --> 02:45:29,322
MATT: There are pockets of the cave that are
walkable. To the left it ends to where the

2399
02:45:29,322 --> 02:45:36,675
boulders and rubble had fallen, to the right it
continues outward towards the outside of the

2400
02:45:36,675 --> 02:45:39,853
mountain where you guys recall stepping to the
edge of the precipice, and you notice that this

2401
02:45:39,853 --> 02:45:45,326
mountain was very,very high up in the mountain
range somewhere in the world where there was just

2402
02:45:45,326 --> 02:45:50,747
ice and snow-capped mountains as far as you could
see into this valley of high crags.

2403
02:45:50,747 --> 02:45:56,076
MARISHA: Well if I recall, it wasn't too far from
Stillben right? Because Keyleth recognized it as

2404
02:45:56,076 --> 02:45:58,456
her home mountains? Like two hours?

2405
02:45:58,456 --> 02:46:05,076
MATT: You recognize it as the Cliffkeep, which is
the large mountain range to the north of Tal'Dorei

2406
02:46:05,076 --> 02:46:13,256
which contains Kraghammer, the very south base
contains Gatshadow, and it's where the Umbra Hills

2407
02:46:13,256 --> 02:46:18,756
leads up into-- You don't know where in that range, it's a
huge mountain range, but it's in that range.

2408
02:46:18,756 --> 02:46:22,246
LIAM: Is there any sign of the pile of gold that
Grog started rage-looting?

2409
02:46:22,246 --> 02:46:25,967
MATT: Make a perception check. (sings) Make a
perception check.

2410
02:46:25,967 --> 02:46:26,992
SAM: Everybody?

2411
02:46:26,992 --> 02:46:29,513
MATT: Everybody who wants to look around.

2412
02:46:29,513 --> 02:46:30,814
LIAM: 23.

2413
02:46:30,814 --> 02:46:34,797
TRAVIS: 18. Oh mine is-- Oh, 18.

2414
02:46:34,797 --> 02:46:36,259
LAURA: 17.

2415
02:46:36,259 --> 02:46:37,200
SAM: 20.

2416
02:46:37,200 --> 02:46:39,184
MATT: Percy. Keyleth.

2417
02:46:39,184 --> 02:46:41,311
TALIESIN: Nine.

2418
02:46:41,311 --> 02:46:43,634
MARISHA: Natural 20.

2419
02:46:43,634 --> 02:46:54,017
MATT: All right. The combined vision of you three,
glancing about, you see there are scattered bits

2420
02:46:54,017 --> 02:47:01,874
of gold and silver occasionally visible around the
floor, but they're all independent and probably

2421
02:47:01,874 --> 02:47:10,871
thrown about during the scuffle or the collapse.
You guys notice there are bits of dragon bone

2422
02:47:10,871 --> 02:47:18,694
trapped beneath the rocks. Exposed elements of
these bones appear to be scraped and already

2423
02:47:18,694 --> 02:47:27,508
sundered by somebody harvesting the remains, the
long-decayed remains, of Brimscythe. You also

2424
02:47:27,508 --> 02:47:35,538
notice there are two tunnels to the north and
south side of this chamber across from where you

2425
02:47:35,538 --> 02:47:42,645
guys entered. They're smooth, about ten feet in
diameter, and both carve into the heart of the rock.

2426
02:47:42,645 --> 02:47:44,241
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check?

2427
02:47:44,241 --> 02:47:45,330
TRAVIS: Umber hulks?

2428
02:47:45,330 --> 02:47:49,612
MARISHA: Yeah, don't those fuckers do that type of
shit? 20 total.

2429
02:47:49,612 --> 02:48:00,122
MATT: 20? Okay. The way these tunnels are created,
and you've seen umber hulks and things of that

2430
02:48:00,122 --> 02:48:06,187
nature carved through, there is a rough aspect to
that digging and burrowing process where the earth

2431
02:48:06,187 --> 02:48:13,908
itself has an uneven, you know, a general purposed
direction, but is in itself a very haphazard just

2432
02:48:13,908 --> 02:48:20,194
grab and tear what's in your way type form of
burrowing. These are round and smooth.

2433
02:48:20,194 --> 02:48:28,023
MARISHA: No scratch marks, claw marks? Almost
seems mechanical type of-- magical?

2434
02:48:28,023 --> 02:48:30,505
TALIESIN: I'll assist in that perception check.

2435
02:48:30,505 --> 02:48:32,007
MATT: Okay, you guys can do that.

2436
02:48:32,007 --> 02:48:34,017
LIAM: And none of us remember them from our past
visit?

2437
02:48:34,017 --> 02:48:39,184
MATT: No. In fact, one of them is burrowing through
the actual rubble on the north side by where the

2438
02:48:39,184 --> 02:48:40,943
hoard was buried.

2439
02:48:40,943 --> 02:48:42,312
LAURA: (gasps) No!

2440
02:48:42,312 --> 02:48:46,120
TALIESIN: All right, taking a look. That's--

2441
02:48:46,120 --> 02:48:50,352
MARISHA: How can you tell?

2442
02:48:50,352 --> 02:48:53,677
TALIESIN: Because it's the flat. 13.

2443
02:48:53,677 --> 02:49:00,161
MATT: Okay. As you step up and look about the
rubble, the best you can make out is parts of the

2444
02:49:00,161 --> 02:49:02,879
rock, and you know, the rock here has been set
since the collapse of this side of the tunnel,

2445
02:49:02,879 --> 02:49:12,560
there are a series of scratch marks across the set
stones and rocks here. Meaning that something

2446
02:49:12,560 --> 02:49:26,239
large has rummaged through the rubble here.
Something with bladed or clawed appendages has

2447
02:49:26,239 --> 02:49:41,562
been here and has very viciously or hurriedly
attempted to find its way through the rubble. You

2448
02:49:41,562 --> 02:49:50,502
also notice there is, to the immediate left and
northwestern side of this cavern, a small alcove

2449
02:49:50,502 --> 02:49:53,470
that just disappears into the wall out of sight.

2450
02:49:53,470 --> 02:49:57,159
MARISHA: That wasn't there before? Or was that one
there before?

2451
02:49:57,159 --> 02:50:01,561
MATT: No, that was there before, yeah.

2452
02:50:01,561 --> 02:50:06,087
LAURA: Does it seem like this could have been made
by a dragon? These scratch marks?

2453
02:50:06,087 --> 02:50:07,153
MATT: You and dragons--

2454
02:50:07,153 --> 02:50:08,177
LAURA: Favored enemy.

2455
02:50:08,177 --> 02:50:10,858
MATT: Yeah, as your favored enemy, make a--

2456
02:50:10,858 --> 02:50:13,906
LAURA: I'm scared of all of my d20s right now.

2457
02:50:13,906 --> 02:50:15,811
MARISHA: Roll good.

2458
02:50:15,811 --> 02:50:18,248
MATT: Make a nature check.

2459
02:50:18,248 --> 02:50:19,627
LAURA: A nature check?

2460
02:50:19,627 --> 02:50:26,749
MATT: With advantage because it's a dragon.
Dragons are magical entities. This would be more

2461
02:50:26,749 --> 02:50:27,989
arcana.

2462
02:50:27,989 --> 02:50:33,757
LAURA: Plus two on dragon checks. Arcana?!

2463
02:50:33,757 --> 02:50:36,911
MATT: They're magical entities. I'll give you
either/or. What did you get?

2464
02:50:36,911 --> 02:50:43,186
LAURA: I rolled a 16, but I get plus two on any
investigation for dragon info stuff.

2465
02:50:43,186 --> 02:50:52,725
MATT: Okay. These marks across could very easily
have come from a dragon, a very large one. You

2466
02:50:52,725 --> 02:51:00,517
also notice that there are elements of the rocks
amongst this rubble, that there appears to be soot

2467
02:51:00,517 --> 02:51:04,740
and singe marks across it.

2468
02:51:04,740 --> 02:51:07,826
LAURA: Are dragons known for digging, or are there
certain types of dragons that are known for

2469
02:51:07,826 --> 02:51:08,829
digging?

2470
02:51:08,829 --> 02:51:19,428
MATT: There are a couple that can burrow and dig
through rock and stone. In particular, the blue

2471
02:51:19,428 --> 02:51:29,390
dragon, the one that you guys defeated in here,
can burrow naturally, as can the white dragons.

2472
02:51:29,390 --> 02:51:35,156
They're natural burrowers, though not the most
intelligent of the chromatic dragons. You also

2473
02:51:35,156 --> 02:51:40,896
know that some of the metallic dragons also, like
the brass dragon is a burrower.

2474
02:51:40,896 --> 02:51:47,565
MARISHA: Would they be capable of making the
smooth tunnels?

2475
02:51:47,565 --> 02:51:54,807
MATT: Not that smooth. Those come from something
else. You inspecting the alcove?

2476
02:51:54,807 --> 02:51:55,767
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2477
02:51:55,767 --> 02:51:59,964
MATT: As you look inside the alcove, immediately
you see in the shadow and what little bit of light

2478
02:51:59,964 --> 02:52:04,106
is coming from the outside part of the tunnel, and
it is pretty obscured here. I would recommend

2479
02:52:04,106 --> 02:52:05,768
putting a torch up if you have one.

2480
02:52:05,768 --> 02:52:06,661
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2481
02:52:06,661 --> 02:52:10,665
MATT: Okay, you spark up a torch. You inspect the
inside of this alcove and immediately you see the

2482
02:52:10,665 --> 02:52:15,015
reflection of the light across the surface of
something. Something humanoid standing there in wait.

2483
02:52:15,015 --> 02:52:18,558
TALIESIN: Whoa! And I back up and draw.

2484
02:52:18,558 --> 02:52:24,678
MATT: You draw your weapon and aim it. What you
can see, as you take a moment, is an older man,

2485
02:52:24,678 --> 02:52:33,032
wrinkled in face, eyes open, mouth agape in fear,
his arms out before him, back to the wall on the

2486
02:52:33,032 --> 02:52:35,306
inside. Frozen solid.

2487
02:52:35,306 --> 02:52:48,599
TALIESIN: I found something! I'm inspecting him as
best I can, frozen solid.

2488
02:52:48,599 --> 02:52:51,172
TRAVIS: Did you do that?

2489
02:52:51,172 --> 02:52:54,552
TALIESIN: No! No, I found this.

2490
02:52:54,552 --> 02:52:55,942
MATT: Investigation check.

2491
02:52:55,942 --> 02:53:01,318
TRAVIS: That's cold-blooded.

2492
02:53:01,318 --> 02:53:03,826
TALIESIN: 14. That's a terrible pun.

2493
02:53:03,826 --> 02:53:14,633
MATT: It's hard to tell what may have frozen him.
The temperature here is very cold. He may have

2494
02:53:14,633 --> 02:53:21,534
just frozen to death, but his face, his expression
leads you to believe that this was more a moment

2495
02:53:21,534 --> 02:53:24,319
of duress. More immediate than a slow, subtle,
over time.

2496
02:53:24,319 --> 02:53:26,123
TALIESIN: What is he wearing?

2497
02:53:26,123 --> 02:53:34,508
MATT: His clothing is very, very well-made. There is
embroidery across the sleeves and the base of

2498
02:53:34,508 --> 02:53:42,983
these robes. He appears to have jewelry on him. He
has not quite a Fu Manchu, but a mustache that

2499
02:53:42,983 --> 02:53:53,944
extends beyond here. The hair is braided and goes
to his lower back. He is human, hunched, and that's

2500
02:53:53,944 --> 02:53:56,199
about the most you can make out at this visual
state.

2501
02:53:56,199 --> 02:53:58,459
SAM: Does it look like he might be my son?

2502
02:53:58,459 --> 02:54:01,206
(laughter)

2503
02:54:01,206 --> 02:54:06,713
MATT: The resemblance is uncanny. No. On top of
being purely human and no one you've ever

2504
02:54:06,713 --> 02:54:07,747
recognized, no.

2505
02:54:07,747 --> 02:54:08,998
SAM: I suspect everyone now.

2506
02:54:08,998 --> 02:54:11,019
LAURA: I wonder if he's the owner of the house.

2507
02:54:11,019 --> 02:54:18,802
MATT: The northern tunnel, the smooth tunnel as
you bring your torch over, whoever's inspecting

2508
02:54:18,802 --> 02:54:20,088
the north one.

2509
02:54:20,088 --> 02:54:21,474
LAURA: Sure, why not?

2510
02:54:21,474 --> 02:54:28,927
MATT: You don't have to, but as you guys look up,
having low-light vision helps in this

2511
02:54:28,927 --> 02:54:34,072
circumstance, as well. You can see a little bit of a
glistening. As you peer into the smooth tunnel

2512
02:54:34,072 --> 02:54:40,580
ahead of you, you can see that where the rock was
burrowed through, a portion of it has opened up a

2513
02:54:40,580 --> 02:54:45,496
pocket, and there's a small fountain of gold
spilling into the tunnel.

2514
02:54:45,496 --> 02:54:47,353
SAM: A fountain of gold?

2515
02:54:47,353 --> 02:54:55,645
MATT: Not like a perpetual-- it looks like
whatever tore through here, gold pieces that were

2516
02:54:55,645 --> 02:55:00,368
buried as part of the collapsing tunnel were
exposed and spilled into the tunnel.

2517
02:55:00,368 --> 02:55:01,363
LAURA: Bag of Holding!

2518
02:55:01,363 --> 02:55:02,324
TRAVIS: What, I have it.

2519
02:55:02,324 --> 02:55:03,609
SAM: It's a Scrooge Dragon.

2520
02:55:03,609 --> 02:55:07,705
TRAVIS: I go over and put it under the gold. I
open up the Bag of Holding.

2521
02:55:07,705 --> 02:55:11,698
SAM: Wait. Why are we here? Why have we come
here?

2522
02:55:11,698 --> 02:55:13,339
MARISHA: Yeah, and remember last time we did
this?

2523
02:55:13,339 --> 02:55:16,072
SAM: Are we just getting as much money as we can and
leave, or are we trying to kill something, or are

2524
02:55:16,072 --> 02:55:18,986
we trying to seal this place off? Why are we
here?

2525
02:55:18,986 --> 02:55:21,304
MARISHA: I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm
with Scanlan.

2526
02:55:21,304 --> 02:55:22,382
TRAVIS: There's gold!

2527
02:55:22,382 --> 02:55:24,993
LAURA: We should definitely take that frozen man.

2528
02:55:24,993 --> 02:55:26,872
SAM: So is our mission to take money and leave?

2529
02:55:26,872 --> 02:55:32,260
TALIESIN: No. There's a frozen man. We actually
have a mystery. We have to deal with this.

2530
02:55:32,260 --> 02:55:35,724
LAURA: Wait, Ashley. I can't hear her. What did
she say?

2531
02:55:35,724 --> 02:55:39,469
ASHLEY: The frozen man is obviously dead.

2532
02:55:39,469 --> 02:55:41,890
MATT: The frozen man is very dead.

2533
02:55:41,890 --> 02:55:43,377
LAURA: Oh, he is? He's dead dead?

2534
02:55:43,377 --> 02:55:45,871
TALIESIN: He's dead dead. He might be the owner of
the house.

2535
02:55:45,871 --> 02:55:47,989
ASHLEY: Did I freeze?

2536
02:55:47,989 --> 02:55:49,577
LIAM: Pike, you're frozen.

2537
02:55:49,577 --> 02:55:51,994
SAM: But we can still hear you, so keep talking.

2538
02:55:51,994 --> 02:55:58,555
MARISHA: Because they said he was an older art
collector, gray-haired man, right?

2539
02:55:58,555 --> 02:56:07,088
MATT: What elements of the individual that you've
heard about does match some of the description of

2540
02:56:07,088 --> 02:56:08,422
this individual.

2541
02:56:08,422 --> 02:56:18,881
ASHLEY: I'm sorry. I would like to see if I could
cast Speak With Dead and ask some questions.

2542
02:56:18,881 --> 02:56:20,346
MATT: Okay.

2543
02:56:20,346 --> 02:56:21,914
SAM: We might have to unfreeze him first.

2544
02:56:21,914 --> 02:56:23,371
LAURA: Maybe not.

2545
02:56:23,371 --> 02:56:26,897
MARISHA: I can maybe do that.

2546
02:56:26,897 --> 02:56:28,463
TALIESIN: Torch-heating the face.

2547
02:56:28,463 --> 02:56:34,126
MARISHA: I'll light up my fire hands and start
melting, just his face.

2548
02:56:34,126 --> 02:56:35,426
ASHLEY: Melting around his mouth.

2549
02:56:35,426 --> 02:56:41,781
MATT: The spell does require the corpse to be able
to speak, so you would have to thaw him.

2550
02:56:41,781 --> 02:56:42,973
MARISHA: Thawing.

2551
02:56:42,973 --> 02:56:48,090
MATT: Okay. It's going to take you a little bit,
but using your simple druidic powers. You're using

2552
02:56:48,090 --> 02:56:52,604
cantrips, essentially. Or your fire hands. Yeah,
so it'll take you a little while, but you begin to

2553
02:56:52,604 --> 02:56:54,897
thaw the corpse. What's everyone else doing?

2554
02:56:54,897 --> 02:56:57,024
LAURA: We're trying to get the gold out from the
wall.

2555
02:56:57,024 --> 02:56:58,380
TRAVIS: We're not yet.

2556
02:56:58,380 --> 02:57:00,302
LAURA: I'm trying to get the gold out from the
wall.

2557
02:57:00,302 --> 02:57:05,156
SAM: If you're going, I'm going with you to
protect you because god knows Trinket won't.

2558
02:57:05,156 --> 02:57:06,699
TALIESIN: I'm keeping an eye on the south.

2559
02:57:06,699 --> 02:57:09,823
MARISHA: I can Move Earth and we can move around
earth.

2560
02:57:09,823 --> 02:57:15,951
LIAM: Out of curiosity, I'm going to carefully
make my way towards the mouth of the cave and see

2561
02:57:15,951 --> 02:57:21,056
if there's anything problematic out there.
Perception check the whole way.

2562
02:57:21,056 --> 02:57:24,593
MATT: You guys step along. You go with Vex into the
tunnel. You're watching the south area as they

2563
02:57:24,593 --> 02:57:28,819
pass you, and you're currently thawing. Is Trinket
coming with you guys, or is Trinket staying with

2564
02:57:28,819 --> 02:57:30,139
you in the tunnel?

2565
02:57:30,139 --> 02:57:32,056
LAURA: He's going to be with us in the tunnel.

2566
02:57:32,056 --> 02:57:34,441
MATT: Okay, cool. And you're with?

2567
02:57:34,441 --> 02:57:35,879
SAM: I'm with Vex and Trink.

2568
02:57:35,879 --> 02:57:41,240
MATT: You start scooping the gold, and you can see
now, some of this appears to have been taken.

2569
02:57:41,240 --> 02:57:49,519
Someone has been through here and it looks like
there has been some attempts at looting this area.

2570
02:57:49,519 --> 02:57:54,677
It looks like someone has already pulled in here,
and there's an empty pocket there, but you start

2571
02:57:54,677 --> 02:57:59,629
pulling gold out and scooping it into the Bag of
Holding. As you guys are walking away, you feel

2572
02:57:59,629 --> 02:58:01,268
this lurch in the floor.

2573
02:58:01,268 --> 02:58:03,322
LAURA: I stop.

2574
02:58:03,322 --> 02:58:05,080
SAM: Wait, that's not us.

2575
02:58:05,080 --> 02:58:06,421
LAURA: Can we feel it?

2576
02:58:06,421 --> 02:58:08,425
MARISHA: Can everyone feel it?

2577
02:58:08,425 --> 02:58:11,272
MATT: All you guys begin to feel this vibration in
the ground.

2578
02:58:11,272 --> 02:58:13,096
LAURA: Okay, maybe we should stop.

2579
02:58:13,096 --> 02:58:15,196
SAM: Faster, faster!

2580
02:58:15,196 --> 02:58:17,317
LAURA: Just pause for a second!

2581
02:58:17,317 --> 02:58:22,349
MATT: It gets louder and more violent. You see the
coins on the ground beginning to rattle and move.

2582
02:58:22,349 --> 02:58:24,320
LIAM: Perception roll to tell if it's an
earthquake?

2583
02:58:24,320 --> 02:58:25,922
SAM: I think because we touched this gold--

2584
02:58:25,922 --> 02:58:27,377
MARISHA: Nature check?

2585
02:58:27,377 --> 02:58:28,954
MATT: Make a nature check.

2586
02:58:28,954 --> 02:58:30,859
MARISHA: 19.

2587
02:58:30,859 --> 02:58:34,500
MATT: It feels like an earthquake.

2588
02:58:34,500 --> 02:58:40,419
MARISHA: (shouting) Earthquake! Get to the
archways! (quieter) Find a bathroom.

2589
02:58:40,419 --> 02:58:48,771
MATT: As the shouting has happened, towards the
center of the room, the ground explodes. There is

2590
02:58:48,771 --> 02:58:54,757
a blast of shrapnel shale that bursts in the
vicinity. No one is immediately there, so none of

2591
02:58:54,757 --> 02:59:02,808
you are harshly impacted, but you see erupting
from the ground a large form begin to burst out of

2592
02:59:02,808 --> 02:59:03,825
the ground.

2593
02:59:03,825 --> 02:59:05,093
LAURA: I hide.

2594
02:59:05,093 --> 02:59:07,798
SAM: Pike! Ask the dead guy who it is.

2595
02:59:07,798 --> 02:59:14,094
MARISHA: Because Pike and I are by the dead guy,
right? I take Pike and back her behind the dead

2596
02:59:14,094 --> 02:59:15,989
guy, and we're hiding.

2597
02:59:15,989 --> 02:59:23,754
MATT: Okay. You guys see this form now in the low
light emerge. Ten, 15, 20, 25 feet up, this long,

2598
02:59:23,754 --> 02:59:33,629
cylindrical mass curves up and begins to shift. As
it does, like a giant arm, it twists around and

2599
02:59:33,629 --> 02:59:40,767
stares at the room, and what you see before you is
this elongated wormlike structure where a giant

2600
02:59:40,767 --> 02:59:48,867
mouth opens up with rows and rows of sharp teeth
on the interior of its toothy maw. Deal with it!

2601
02:59:48,867 --> 02:59:57,189
It's the perfect circumstance for the term. As you
see strands of saliva pull apart and you see a

2602
02:59:57,189 --> 03:00:06,448
very hint of color beneath the dark surface, a
deep purple tone to its thick segmented hide.

2603
03:00:06,448 --> 03:00:08,325
MARISHA: We've fought one of these before, right?

2604
03:00:08,325 --> 03:00:09,826
MATT: No, you have not.

2605
03:00:09,826 --> 03:00:12,966
LAURA: We have not? I hide. I hide in my cloak.

2606
03:00:12,966 --> 03:00:16,243
TALIESIN: That's a big bag you've got there.

2607
03:00:16,243 --> 03:00:19,305
(groaning)

2608
03:00:19,305 --> 03:00:21,683
MATT: And that's where we're going to leave
tonight's session.

2609
03:00:21,683 --> 03:00:23,711
(yelling)

2610
03:00:23,711 --> 03:00:26,419
LAURA: Oh no!

2611
03:00:26,419 --> 03:00:29,609
MATT: So next week, we're going to pick up with
that chaos.

2612
03:00:29,609 --> 03:00:32,398
LAURA: Ash, you have to be here next week, too!

2613
03:00:32,398 --> 03:00:34,021
SAM: What the fuck is a purple worm?

2614
03:00:34,021 --> 03:00:35,936
LIAM: Put that thing away. Put it back in the
bag.

2615
03:00:35,936 --> 03:00:37,966
ASHLEY: I don't think I'm working next Thursday.

2616
03:00:37,966 --> 03:00:39,512
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Yay!

2617
03:00:39,512 --> 03:00:42,292
ALL: Fly home!

2618
03:00:42,292 --> 03:00:45,229
MATT: We'll all pitch in. I'm kind of serious.

2619
03:00:45,229 --> 03:00:47,376
SAM: Hey, chat room, buy her a ticket home.

2620
03:00:47,376 --> 03:00:50,501
MARISHA: Don't! Don't do it. They're too nice.

2621
03:00:50,501 --> 03:01:00,954
MATT: Don't do that. We'll pick up at the start of
this encounter next Thursday. Things with

2622
03:01:00,954 --> 03:01:02,459
tremorsense are fun.

2623
03:01:02,459 --> 03:01:04,755
LAURA: How much gold did we get, though, before it
cocked up?

2624
03:01:04,755 --> 03:01:07,518
MATT: You'll find out. You haven't had a chance to
count.

2625
03:01:07,518 --> 03:01:10,667
TALIESIN: We'll finish looting that once we've cut
this thing up into little pieces of sushi.

2626
03:01:10,667 --> 03:01:15,830
MARISHA: Man, Matt knows us really well. We walk
into every fucking everything.

2627
03:01:15,830 --> 03:01:17,616
LAURA: You know, sometimes you just have to.

2628
03:01:17,616 --> 03:01:19,624
TALIESIN: We don't walk away.

2629
03:01:19,624 --> 03:01:21,107
MATT: That's what adventure is!

2630
03:01:21,107 --> 03:01:22,254
LAURA: You've got to.

2631
03:01:22,254 --> 03:01:23,718
TALIESIN: It's a series of bad decisions.

2632
03:01:23,718 --> 03:01:25,858
MATT: You really don't have to, but it was an
option.

2633
03:01:25,858 --> 03:01:29,755
SAM: (singing) Danger lurks behind you.

2634
03:01:29,755 --> 03:01:35,514
ALL: (singing) There's a stranger out to find you.
What to do, just grab onto some--

2635
03:01:35,514 --> 03:01:36,682
MATT: (singing) Critical Role!

2636
03:01:36,682 --> 03:01:37,897
ALL: (singing) Whoo!

2637
03:01:37,897 --> 03:01:43,358
MATT: All right, that happened. Cool, we're going
to get set up for Critmas, guys, so we can all get

2638
03:01:43,358 --> 03:01:48,394
to sleep at hopefully a decent hour. Give us a few
minutes to set up. We're going to go off for a

2639
03:01:48,394 --> 03:01:52,393
little bit, but we'll be back here as soon as
possible when we're ready to go. We'll see you in

2640
03:01:52,393 --> 03:01:53,742
a second, guys.

2641
03:01:53,742 --> 04:21:57,000
