NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.819
MATT: Hello! My name is Matthew Mercer. 
I'm a voice actor, and the Dungeon Master

00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:07.900
for Critical Role here on Geek &amp; Sundry, 
and welcome to today's episode of GM tips.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.090
Today's theme: getting your players 
to engage in more roleplay.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.370
[music]

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.360
Now, I want to preface this with the idea 
that you cannot force your players to roleplay.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.388
Some just may not be comfortable with it. 
Some may not be into this game for heavy RP,

00:00:27.388 --> 00:00:31.969
and instead want more of a Diablo-like
kill shit, take loot experience--

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:35.339
and that's totally fine, it's totally great-- 
a little worrying, but totally great!

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:39.019
However, you can certainly engage them 
with some of the following tips,

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:42.219
and you may be surprised which elements 
they pick up and end up liking.

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:46.838 line:1
My first recommendation is to talk to your group 
in advance about wanting to

00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:48.681 line:1
actually RP more in the campaign.

00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:52.360 line:1
You don't want them being caught off-guard 
with an aggressive change in GMing style

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.102
that asks more of them.

00:00:54.102 --> 00:00:56.288
It puts them in a weird, awkward place 
where they feel like they have to

00:00:56.288 --> 00:00:59.779
perform more for you. You want it to be 
natural and fun, so listen to them.

00:00:59.779 --> 00:01:03.430
Engage with their eagerness, 
and adjust your expectations accordingly.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.108 line:1
Next, if the group is on board, 
have them develop some written background stories,

00:01:07.108 --> 00:01:11.428 line:1
or history about their character, 
or general personality traits if they haven't already.

00:01:11.428 --> 00:01:15.135 line:1
I mean, not everyone has to write a 
multi-page backstory, you just have to

00:01:15.135 --> 00:01:20.140
have a half-page or one-page history 
that helps them become more invested

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.558
in their character, if anything. 
It aids them in finding elements of

00:01:23.558 --> 00:01:26.909
their history and informing them of their 
own personality traits, impulses,

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.328
and general reactions to elements they 
may encounter throughout the campaign.

00:01:30.328 --> 00:01:34.039
It's a useful tool for anyone involved. 
You can even award bonus experience

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:39.359
or some other small reward if you feel inclined
if you need just a little push to finish it--

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:44.697
which you will, because we're all
human beings who are busy... and lazy...

00:01:44.697 --> 00:01:47.251
I'm very lazy.

00:01:47.251 --> 00:01:50.519
Some systems, like fifth edition 
Dungeons and Dragons have a whole section

00:01:50.519 --> 00:01:53.601
of the source book on characters, personalities, 
and backgrounds that can be a great guide

00:01:53.601 --> 00:01:58.791
to fleshing out a character's personality-- 
or just rolling for it if you just don't give a [beep].

00:01:58.791 --> 00:02:03.620
Get comfortable enough with your early NPCs 
and their dialogue points to try and engage

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.560 line:1
players with a lot of eye contact and direct gestures.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.862 line:1
Do not read the entire encounter off the page, 
because they'll disengage immediately and

00:02:10.862 --> 00:02:14.756
not really be willing to meet you on a level 
that you're not willing to meet them.

00:02:14.756 --> 00:02:19.006
When you begin your endgame foray into upping 
the RP with your players, you really need

00:02:19.006 --> 00:02:23.066
to speak to them as the NPCs in the same nature
that you wish them to RP in return.

00:02:23.066 --> 00:02:26.651
Make direct eye-contact with whichever 
party member or members who are

00:02:26.651 --> 00:02:30.516
leading that encounter. Lean in and gesture, 
or point them when asking a question

00:02:30.516 --> 00:02:35.395
for their character! Let them know 
that they are in the moment, and

00:02:35.395 --> 00:02:42.060
this is their moment to seize! 
When a player begins to describe

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.889
the gist of their response instead of in-character, 
gently remind them to try and respond

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:50.622
in-character, like, "Great! How would Durmans 
ask that question to me, the jailer?"

00:02:50.622 --> 00:02:56.516
or "Sure! And as those angry thoughts fill her mind, 
how would Leila express that verbally?"

00:02:56.516 --> 00:03:02.135
Now, players, sometimes a different or 
silly voice can help. Textures, speaking

00:03:02.135 --> 00:03:05.655
in a lighter place in your palate, or something 
that's a little different than your normal speaking voice.

00:03:05.655 --> 00:03:09.415 line:1
Fun voices and accents are by no means 
necessary for the game, but they can help

00:03:09.415 --> 00:03:13.814 line:1
you as well as your fellow players and GM 
separate your in-character dialogue from

00:03:13.814 --> 00:03:17.736 line:1
your own thoughts and comments in the game. 
Physicality helps too! Think of how different

00:03:17.736 --> 00:03:21.206
your character would hold themselves 
compared to you. Would they sit up straight,

00:03:21.206 --> 00:03:25.005
broaden their shoulders-- or curl up and 
act like a crazy person?

00:03:25.005 --> 00:03:29.406
Maybe they give giant, bombastic gestures! 
You may find yourself physically embodying

00:03:29.406 --> 00:03:33.256
your character in RP moments more often once 
you think on these little details.

00:03:33.256 --> 00:03:38.657 line:1
For all you GMs, you need to be patient. 
For some players, it's a really big step

00:03:38.657 --> 00:03:43.294 line:1
in letting go of their own insecurities and embracing 
the play that makes these games so wonderful.

00:03:43.294 --> 00:03:47.926
Don't expect a huge, sudden change. 
It may just take a while-- sometimes

00:03:47.926 --> 00:03:53.275
a very long while, if at all. Be supportive. 
Compliment players after a session for good

00:03:53.275 --> 00:03:57.575
roleplaying and don't scold them for any 
missed moments or opportunities during the session.

00:03:57.575 --> 00:04:02.376 line:1
Players, also be supportive to your 
other players and willing to elevate your

00:04:02.376 --> 00:04:05.037 line:1
less comfortable players. 
Let them have the spotlight.

00:04:05.037 --> 00:04:08.154
Pay attention to them when they're speaking, 
and back up their statements with your own

00:04:08.154 --> 00:04:14.016
in-character moments: "Indeed!" or 
"Exactly, Leila!" if they make a good point in RP.

00:04:14.016 --> 00:04:19.936
Most of all, have fun! Even just the slightest 
shift in this direction can lead to some of

00:04:19.936 --> 00:04:23.254
the most immersive RP experiences, 
but you have to make sure that all these

00:04:23.254 --> 00:04:26.947
experiences are still fun for everyone involved. 
That's the key to the game,

00:04:26.947 --> 00:04:30.726
and that's the key to making your 
players want to engage more on a roleplaying level.

00:04:30.726 --> 00:04:33.787
Anyway, I hope these tips have 
been useful to you at all.
