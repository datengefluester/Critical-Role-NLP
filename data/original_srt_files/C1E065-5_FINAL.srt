1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,687
LIAM: Good evening, and welcome to another
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:07,687 --> 00:00:14,255
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around playing Dungeons
and Dragons, which is what we're going to do this

3
00:00:14,255 --> 00:00:17,785
week, we're going to play some goddamn Dungeons
and Dragons. I've had crap bouncing around my

4
00:00:17,785 --> 00:00:21,715
skull for two weeks. I don't know how Matthew does
it. I don't ever want to do it again, but I'm

5
00:00:21,715 --> 00:00:26,015
excited for tonight. Ah, so welcome to my little
one-shot.

6
00:00:26,015 --> 00:00:27,719
TRAVIS: I love it.

7
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:34,739
LIAM: What can we talk about? Hey guys, pay
attention to the video after our little welcome

8
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:38,913
here, because there's going to be some extra
stuff, and you guys, the cast, are verboten to

9
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:42,883
look at your smart phones, watches and stuff.

10
00:00:42,883 --> 00:00:44,705
TRAVIS: Verboten from social medias.

11
00:00:44,705 --> 00:00:46,626
MARY: We won't see any of your texts.

12
00:00:46,626 --> 00:00:47,718
TRAVIS: Yar.

13
00:00:47,718 --> 00:00:48,596
MARY: That's all.

14
00:00:48,596 --> 00:00:51,278
TRAVIS and MARY: (speaking German)

15
00:00:51,278 --> 00:00:53,070
MARY: Yeah. Well, that goes without saying.

16
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,686
LIAM: You're introducing the characters a little
early, but that's okay.

17
00:00:56,686 --> 00:00:58,701
ASHLY: What are they saying? What's happening?

18
00:00:58,701 --> 00:01:00,097
TRAVIS: It's okay, it's Spanish.

19
00:01:00,097 --> 00:01:01,879
(laughter)

20
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:06,159
LIAM: Hey, I'm so chomping at the bit to fall on
my face, let's do our announcements so that we can

21
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,413
get to it.

22
00:01:07,413 --> 00:01:14,207
TRAVIS: Hey! This week's episode's brought to you
by Lootcrate! The amazing Lootcrate, of which we

23
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:17,679
have a new crate to unbox. Grab your boxes.

24
00:01:17,679 --> 00:01:19,090
ASHLY: Oh, are we all doing it?

25
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:21,723
TRAVIS: Open up. This is their anti-hero box.

26
00:01:21,723 --> 00:01:24,024
ASHLY: What? Oh my god, what a charmed life we
lead.

27
00:01:24,024 --> 00:01:30,290
TRAVIS: This is their anti-hero box. Well look
who's ahead of you, and immediately, I am greeted

28
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,723
by an Archer shirt.

29
00:01:32,723 --> 00:01:35,169
LAURA: It's so hard! Why are you guys so fast?

30
00:01:35,169 --> 00:01:37,579
ASHLY: This table's losing.

31
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:39,395
MARY: Sterling Archer, oh my gosh.

32
00:01:39,395 --> 00:01:42,282
LAURA: Oh, shit.

33
00:01:42,282 --> 00:01:44,090
MARY: Ooh! What size do you have?

34
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,198
ASHLY: I have a medium here.

35
00:01:46,198 --> 00:01:48,928
MARY: We're going to switch boxes right now, tiny
tiny.

36
00:01:48,928 --> 00:01:51,207
TRAVIS: Dude, we have Kill Bill socks.

37
00:01:51,207 --> 00:01:58,425
LIAM: Oh my gosh! It's the right hand of doom from
Hellboy! Is this made just for me?

38
00:01:58,425 --> 00:02:01,647
ASHLY: Hey, are these Kill Bill Socks?

39
00:02:01,647 --> 00:02:02,770
LAURA: They are.

40
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:03,840
ASHLY: That's amazing.

41
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,734
LAURA: Hey look. World of Warcraft pins.

42
00:02:05,734 --> 00:02:07,746
TRAVIS: You are the biggest Hellboy nerd I know.

43
00:02:07,746 --> 00:02:09,901
LIAM: Stop the show! I'm going home!

44
00:02:09,901 --> 00:02:19,259
MARY: Oh, World of Warcraft pins! Everyone, please
get the new expansion, it's fantastic.

45
00:02:19,259 --> 00:02:23,993
TRAVIS: And Harley. Ah, Harley. Just waiting for
Mr J.

46
00:02:23,993 --> 00:02:25,433
ASHLY: Oh, puddin'!

47
00:02:25,433 --> 00:02:29,653
TRAVIS: Woo! That is your anti-hero Lootcrate box
that is out right now.

48
00:02:29,653 --> 00:02:30,947
MARY: What is this?

49
00:02:30,947 --> 00:02:34,719
LIAM: You turn the boxes inside out and they
become something cool. Something to do with that.

50
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:42,749
TRAVIS: That's the Hellboy fist. Look at that. A
sexual toy. A big red fist.

51
00:02:42,749 --> 00:02:47,363
LAURA: Oh, look! It tells you how to do it!
Transform your crate.

52
00:02:47,363 --> 00:02:49,135
ASHLY: Into what?

53
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:50,392
LAURA: I don't know.

54
00:02:50,392 --> 00:02:53,120
TRAVIS: And coming up, they have a speed-themed
box.

55
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,004
LAURA: Oh my god, into a mallet.

56
00:02:55,004 --> 00:03:00,308
TRAVIS: With a high-octane assortment of goodies,
ranging from Batman, CW's The Flash, Arrow,

57
00:03:00,308 --> 00:03:05,159
Battlestar Galactica, Iron Man, Gone in 60
Seconds. It includes two collectibles, a figure,

58
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:12,996
and, as always, our monthly t-shirt, and
pan-speed. Coming next month. And if you have a

59
00:03:12,996 --> 00:03:18,960
style need, along with the speed collection, there
are also some Sonic the Hedgehog socks. Being the

60
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,672
voice of Knuckles, I don't know if they're red--
you know, because I'm clearly the fastest person

61
00:03:22,672 --> 00:03:27,648
in the show. They're probably blue? Fucking hell.
All right, well, they're probably the little blue

62
00:03:27,648 --> 00:03:29,003
hedgehog's color.

63
00:03:29,003 --> 00:03:30,363
MARY: But your Hellboy fist is red.

64
00:03:30,363 --> 00:03:33,755
TRAVIS: That's right. And you also have a
Transformer's wearable for your world-saving

65
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:36,390
needs. And a MarioKart tee.

66
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,105
LAURA: And I think if you wear glasses, this shirt
is 3D.

67
00:03:38,105 --> 00:03:39,168
MARY: What?

68
00:03:39,168 --> 00:03:41,007
LAURA: No, I'm making that up, but it would be
really cool.

69
00:03:41,007 --> 00:03:42,242
LIAM: Oh. I wish you weren't a liar.

70
00:03:42,242 --> 00:03:47,687
TRAVIS: And as always, the promo code:
Lootcrate.com/criticalrole. Three dollars off your

71
00:03:47,687 --> 00:03:48,865
subscription.

72
00:03:48,865 --> 00:03:49,913
LIAM: Smooth.

73
00:03:49,913 --> 00:03:54,546
TRAVIS: And a special message from this-- no,
there's actually no special message. But maybe

74
00:03:54,546 --> 00:03:55,992
we'll work that in later.

75
00:03:55,992 --> 00:03:57,060
MARY: China.

76
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,359
TRAVIS: Oh, really? (laughs) China.

77
00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:00,854
ALL: Thanks, Lootcrate!

78
00:04:00,854 --> 00:04:05,815
TRAVIS: I'm going to be walking around my house
naked in an Archer t-shirt.

79
00:04:05,815 --> 00:04:12,309
MARY: I've been getting the DX boxes? Is that what
they are, the DX boxes are flipping awesome as well.

80
00:04:12,309 --> 00:04:13,294
TRAVIS: Aren't they?

81
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:16,590
MARY: They're amazing. They're really legit, so go
for it, dudes.

82
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,739
LAURA: Ah, legit.

83
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:19,193
TRAVIS: And the LootBags, the LootPackages...

84
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:20,837
MARY: Yeah. I want to try the LootWear.

85
00:04:20,837 --> 00:04:23,119
TRAVIS: Don't steal my stuff when the show is
over.

86
00:04:23,119 --> 00:04:25,385
MARY: Don't any of you guys touch my stuff.

87
00:04:25,385 --> 00:04:27,641
LIAM: Is it? He's here! It's real! It's happening,
it's happening!

88
00:04:27,641 --> 00:04:29,534
LAURA: There's more!

89
00:04:29,534 --> 00:04:32,611
TRAVIS: Come on in there. Come and sit down.

90
00:04:32,611 --> 00:04:34,542
SAM: Hi, guys.

91
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:36,090
LIAM: Say Lootcrate three times.

92
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,171
SAM: Lootcrate, Lootcrate, Lootcrate?

93
00:04:37,171 --> 00:04:38,753
ALL: Yeah!

94
00:04:38,753 --> 00:04:39,983
SAM: You did it already?

95
00:04:39,983 --> 00:04:41,283
LAURA: You missed it. Yep.

96
00:04:41,283 --> 00:04:43,321
TRAVIS: The man is out of breath.

97
00:04:43,321 --> 00:04:51,584
LIAM: As far as other announcements go, the only
one that I'm aware of, please add in after me, but

98
00:04:51,584 --> 00:04:54,005
a bunch of us are going to SacAnime.

99
00:04:54,005 --> 00:04:58,878
TRAVIS: Raise your hand. Oh, five of six.

100
00:04:58,878 --> 00:05:00,219
LAURA: Minus one Ashly Burch.

101
00:05:00,219 --> 00:05:01,730
MARY: Sorry, Ashly.

102
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:04,217
ASHLY: Yeah, it's fine. Cool. Cool, guys. It's
fine. It's no big deal.

103
00:05:04,217 --> 00:05:07,956
LIAM: Sacramento doesn't want you, Ashly.

104
00:05:07,956 --> 00:05:09,494
MARY: That's right. They told me.

105
00:05:09,494 --> 00:05:11,544
ASHLY: I don't want them, either, so fuck it!
Whatever.

106
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:13,864
TRAVIS: We've got some super-sized carry-on
luggage.

107
00:05:13,864 --> 00:05:17,738
ASHLY: Fuck Sacramento! I'll say it on air right
now.

108
00:05:17,738 --> 00:05:19,301
LAURA: No. Don't say that!

109
00:05:19,301 --> 00:05:22,133
ASHLY: Fuck them all! No, I actually really like
SacAnime. I've been there before. They're great.

110
00:05:22,133 --> 00:05:24,364
MARY: Have you guys been? I've never been to
SacAnime.

111
00:05:24,364 --> 00:05:25,405
LAURA: You haven't?

112
00:05:25,405 --> 00:05:29,513
MARY: It's my first. Steve and I will be there
Saturday and Sunday. Steve Blum.

113
00:05:29,513 --> 00:05:33,282
LIAM: I think I've been there eight or nine or
maybe ten times. I don't know why.

114
00:05:33,282 --> 00:05:36,125
TRAVIS: Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, we'll be
there.

115
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:39,756
MARY: Are you going to be all right over there?

116
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,907
LAURA: Oh! I rolled two 20s in my pre-rolls.

117
00:05:42,907 --> 00:05:44,428
ASHLY: Why would you do that now?

118
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:45,720
LAURA: I don't know!

119
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,414
LIAM: You know what? Later, you can slide them
out, positioned like that. How's that?

120
00:05:49,414 --> 00:05:52,059
LAURA: I like it. Thank you. I appreciate that,
DM.

121
00:05:52,059 --> 00:05:53,768
ASHLY: Yeah, thanks for letting us cheat.

122
00:05:53,768 --> 00:06:00,245
LIAM: Okay, as a thin stream of wee goes down my
leg, why don't we dig in? Let's cut to the video,

123
00:06:00,245 --> 00:06:01,808
because I'm so excited to go!

124
00:06:01,808 --> 00:06:03,246
SAM: We're cutting to a video?

125
00:06:03,246 --> 00:06:05,323
LIAM: Do you have any announcements? Is there
anything fun in your life?

126
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,911
SAM: Yeah, we'll be at SacAnime--

127
00:06:06,911 --> 00:06:10,230
ASHLY: Do you want to talk about Loot Crate, too?

128
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,846
SAM: I... nope?

129
00:06:12,846 --> 00:06:14,076
(laughter)

130
00:06:14,076 --> 00:06:17,268
LIAM: All right, well. We'll be right back.

131
00:06:17,268 --> 00:07:52,541
[dramatic music]

132
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:56,960
LIAM: Hey there, friends. Let me ask you
something: Chroma Conclave got you down? Aw, sure

133
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,656
it does. That's a heavy scene, man. Remember when
things were simpler? When the biggest threats

134
00:08:01,656 --> 00:08:08,019
around were an eyeball under a mountain and a
Bohemian power couple? (sighs) Good times. Hey,

135
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:13,496
what do you say we turn the clock back a bit?
Welcome back to Emon, before the dragons came.

136
00:08:13,496 --> 00:08:19,385
Anyone in the mood for a heist job? Okay, let's go
over what we're doing tonight.

137
00:08:19,385 --> 00:08:25,051
Everybody remember this gentleman, Spireling
Shenn? Yeah, I like the look of this guy. You

138
00:08:25,051 --> 00:08:29,950
probably recall him attempting to reach a business
arrangement between the Clasp and Vox Machina in

139
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:35,179
the days after Emon fell. It didn't really pan
out, and that's okay. He's always been a busy guy,

140
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:41,179
has multiple irons in the fire on any given day,
and on this cold and rainy evening, he simply

141
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:46,815
needs something retrieved for him. Something
important. Only trouble is, it belongs to someone

142
00:08:46,815 --> 00:08:50,129
else. Someone who'd rather not part with it.

143
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:56,306
This is Adelaide Bluebutton, better known as the
Shrew. Adelaide is a rather successful

144
00:08:56,306 --> 00:09:00,948
businesswoman here in Emon. She buys and sells
exotic curiosities from all the far-flung corners

145
00:09:00,948 --> 00:09:06,034
of the world, mostly on the black market. Oh, and
she's really good at money laundering, too, which

146
00:09:06,034 --> 00:09:10,933
the Clasp would know; they've used her extensively
in the past. Had a bit of a falling-out in recent

147
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:15,999
months, though. The Clasp invited her to join
them, but Adelaide wasn't interested, and with her

148
00:09:15,999 --> 00:09:21,616
business growing the way it was-- well, the Clasp
prefers people they can control. And by the way,

149
00:09:21,616 --> 00:09:27,425
if you're by any chance wondering how she came by
the moniker "The Shrew," she earned it. Bluebutton

150
00:09:27,425 --> 00:09:32,501
is as mean a son of a bitch as you will ever meet.
A visiting merchant once tried to get the drop on

151
00:09:32,501 --> 00:09:38,263
her and steal her wares. She ripped his arms off
without lifting a finger. But a mark is a mark,

152
00:09:38,263 --> 00:09:44,790
and Spireling Shenn wants something specific.
Earlier this year, Adelaide acquired an emerald as

153
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:52,708
big as a cantaloupe: Tagmut's Eye. Priceless. That
is a substantial amount of capital that the Clasp

154
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:59,960
could bend to its purposes. That's where these
guys come in.

155
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:06,539
This is Tarvis. Yes, that is the name Travis went
with. He's an assassin-- a good one. Tarvis is the

156
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:11,718
lead on one of Shenn's many teams here in Emon.
He's also being groomed for more responsibility by

157
00:10:11,718 --> 00:10:18,354
his higher-ups, and is entirely devoted to his
masters. His instructions: lead his team into

158
00:10:18,354 --> 00:10:23,703
Adelaide Bluebutton's private residence, find the
gem, and get the hell out of Dodge. Simple.

159
00:10:23,703 --> 00:10:29,677
Actually, I should probably confess something
here. All of our players tonight? They've been

160
00:10:29,677 --> 00:10:36,237
given secrets, and they all think they're the only
ones. Tarvis's secret? The gem is actually a cover

161
00:10:36,237 --> 00:10:40,958
Shenn has given him, specifically, to keep the
rest of his team from knowing the mission's true

162
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:48,123
objective: the Shrew's secret records. Shenn has
told him to find a green leather-bound ledger

163
00:10:48,123 --> 00:10:53,026
containing the name of every shady character the
Shrew has ever dealt with in Emon, including

164
00:10:53,026 --> 00:10:59,123
traitors to the throne. Valuable information. But
according to Shenn, intelligence indicates that

165
00:10:59,123 --> 00:11:04,106
the book will most likely be found in the woman's
basement or possibly in some sort of vault on the

166
00:11:04,106 --> 00:11:10,136
second floor, it's not clear. He's to find the
book and keep it secret from his team. (sighs) You

167
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:13,179
know what? I'd better hurry this along. We've got
a house to break into.

168
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:19,359
This fellow here is Obby the Rat. He's quick with
his hands and quicker with his mouth. He's the

169
00:11:19,359 --> 00:11:24,473
break-in guy. Hasn't met many locked doors that
can slow him down. Obby has known Tarvis for

170
00:11:24,473 --> 00:11:28,298
years. They used to play in the streets together
as kids, and Tarvis saved him from enough

171
00:11:28,298 --> 00:11:35,239
ass-kickings that he is fiercely loyal to the
half-orc. Loves that big guy. Also, I gave him no

172
00:11:35,239 --> 00:11:37,965
secrets, just because I thought it would be funny.

173
00:11:37,965 --> 00:11:43,822
Next, we move on to Delweth. Good with a blade,
knows a bit of magic, just as easily kill you as

174
00:11:43,822 --> 00:11:50,705
look at you. She's pretty badass. Also, just
between you and me: she secretly loathes Tarvis.

175
00:11:50,705 --> 00:11:55,817
She's been with the Clasp for years, and is
itching for advancement, but instead of her, they

176
00:11:55,817 --> 00:12:02,273
fawn over the half-orc instead. So she's decided
tonight is her chance to solve that problem.

177
00:12:02,273 --> 00:12:09,224
That's her secret: once they secure this gem,
Tarvis is a dead man. Hell, probably the whole

178
00:12:09,224 --> 00:12:14,704
team. What happens at the Shrew's stays at the
Shrew's. And as far as the Clasp will know, they

179
00:12:14,704 --> 00:12:16,813
all died doing what they loved.

180
00:12:16,813 --> 00:12:23,464
And this is Dren. She may be small, but trust me,
she can wreck your day. Although lately, she's

181
00:12:23,464 --> 00:12:29,030
been doing a lot of babysitting. See, the team
actually has an outsider in tow tonight: someone

182
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:35,234
who knows Adelaide and knows the house almost as
well as the Shrew does. Dren has been assigned to

183
00:12:35,234 --> 00:12:40,257
guarding this turncoat for close to two months
now. The Clasp has kept her under house arrest,

184
00:12:40,257 --> 00:12:45,963
and Dren has been the one to bring her food, keep
her from bolting, pass the time with her... In

185
00:12:45,963 --> 00:12:53,606
fact, probably too much time. See, she and her
charge have fallen in love. Or lust. You know

186
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:59,766
what? It's complicated. But Dren has revealed to
her prisoner that despite their word, the Clasp

187
00:12:59,766 --> 00:13:06,502
intends to kill her as soon as the job is done. So
the two have cooked up a plan: once the emerald

188
00:13:06,502 --> 00:13:12,542
has been secured, they kill everyone, take the
gem, and live happily ever after in another city.

189
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:21,445
Which just leaves us with Devan. Devan is... well,
a gambling addict, mostly. She's pretty good with

190
00:13:21,445 --> 00:13:26,897
magic, too, but losing money is her real gift.
Three months ago, Devan drunkenly shot her mouth

191
00:13:26,897 --> 00:13:31,710
off at the wrong card table and boasted that she
knew the Shrew, and what's more, she knew the lay

192
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:38,225
of the old hag's house like it was her own. And
she was even telling the truth. See, Devan is the

193
00:13:38,225 --> 00:13:43,809
Shrew's granddaughter. Well estranged
granddaughter. All right, they hate each other.

194
00:13:43,809 --> 00:13:50,359
Grandma Adelaide once trained Devan as she came to
master the family's innate magical talents. Only

195
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:54,890
for a few years, though, when she was younger,
after the kid's mother cut and ran. But for some

196
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:59,654
reason, it didn't end well, and the old woman
kicked her out on the street. What can you do?

197
00:13:59,654 --> 00:14:04,452
Well, before she could blink, the Clasp had
promptly bought up all her gambling debt, and now

198
00:14:04,452 --> 00:14:09,394
they have her under their thumb. They gave her a
choice: guide Tarvis's team through her

199
00:14:09,394 --> 00:14:15,610
grandmother's death trap of a house or take a dirt
nap in the sewers. Now, remember, bringing Dren

200
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:22,020
back into the story, the two halfling lovers have
hatched a plan: once the gem is procured, they

201
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:30,128
kill the others and run off into the sunset.
There's just one thing: Devan doesn't love Dren.

202
00:14:30,128 --> 00:14:36,528
She's playing her. Once the others are down, she's
taking out Dren, grabbing the emerald, and

203
00:14:36,528 --> 00:14:41,128
splitting town on her own. Nothing personal.

204
00:14:41,128 --> 00:14:59,492
So there you have it. Thanks for tuning in
tonight, and welcome back to Emon.

205
00:14:59,492 --> 00:15:03,993
(laughter)

206
00:15:03,993 --> 00:15:10,428
LIAM: Welcome back. I am very excited to share
with you all what has cooked inside my head for

207
00:15:10,428 --> 00:15:15,401
two weeks. Before we go, I think it would be cool
to really quick, to clarify for the audience,

208
00:15:15,401 --> 00:15:22,131
could you all introduce yourselves, your name,
your class, your race. That's racist.

209
00:15:22,131 --> 00:15:24,141
SAM: My mouth is full!

210
00:15:24,141 --> 00:15:25,622
LIAM: We can start on this end.

211
00:15:25,622 --> 00:15:33,412
LAURA: Hi! My name is Devan Bluebutton. I spit as
I said it. I'm a halfling! And I'm a sorcerer.

212
00:15:33,412 --> 00:15:39,096
ASHLY: My name's Dren, and I don't have a last
name, like Prince! And I'm an assassin, and a

213
00:15:39,096 --> 00:15:40,133
halfling.

214
00:15:40,133 --> 00:15:41,652
(laughter)

215
00:15:41,652 --> 00:15:47,684
MARY: My name is Delweth, I'm a wood elf. I have
no last name, like Cher. Actually, my last name is

216
00:15:47,684 --> 00:15:50,954
Cher. Is that it?

217
00:15:50,954 --> 00:15:52,879
LIAM: Sure.

218
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:54,816
TRAVIS: I've got naan in my teeth.

219
00:15:54,816 --> 00:15:56,733
MARY: That's his name, Naan-in-Teeth.

220
00:15:56,733 --> 00:15:58,355
TRAVIS: My name is Tarvis.

221
00:15:58,355 --> 00:16:00,457
(laughter)

222
00:16:00,457 --> 00:16:04,199
LAURA: Sounds like a lot of thought went into
that.

223
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:08,271
LIAM: I texted Travis about five times over a
period of a week saying, "Hey man, you know, give

224
00:16:08,316 --> 00:16:13,288
"me a name at some point so I can start." Crickets,
crickets, crickets. Finally, I'm like, "Hey man,

225
00:16:13,361 --> 00:16:15,195
"I'm going to go with Tarvis." "Yeah, sounds
good."

226
00:16:15,195 --> 00:16:17,951
(laughter)

227
00:16:17,951 --> 00:16:22,436
TRAVIS: Brilliance, inspiration incarnate. And I
am a half-orc.

228
00:16:22,436 --> 00:16:24,335
MARY: What's your other half?

229
00:16:24,335 --> 00:16:26,727
SAM: Also orc.

230
00:16:26,727 --> 00:16:28,993
(laughter)

231
00:16:28,993 --> 00:16:32,237
LIAM: Also an assassin, and what's your
intelligence? What's it say on there?

232
00:16:32,237 --> 00:16:33,904
SAM: Yeah, what's your intelligence?

233
00:16:33,904 --> 00:16:37,040
TRAVIS: I am smart as balls, y'all, 18!

234
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,508
ALL: Whoa!

235
00:16:39,508 --> 00:16:41,736
TRAVIS: Quantum physics, that's my shit.

236
00:16:41,736 --> 00:16:43,483
MARY: Oh, I'm a rogue.

237
00:16:43,483 --> 00:16:50,965
SAM: Yes, and I am Obby the Rat. I am a dwarf. I
am a rogue. That's it.

238
00:16:50,965 --> 00:16:52,486
LIAM: Happy to have you!

239
00:16:52,486 --> 00:16:53,886
TRAVIS: And you're handsome.

240
00:16:53,886 --> 00:16:56,263
MARY: You have the best moustache ever!

241
00:16:56,263 --> 00:17:01,738
LIAM: Really, I'm just procrastinating, we should
do this. Okay!

242
00:17:01,738 --> 00:17:03,037
TRAVIS: Let's get it on!

243
00:17:03,037 --> 00:17:04,400
LIAM: Let's get it on.

244
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,664
SAM: Roll for initiative.

245
00:17:05,664 --> 00:17:07,355
(laughter)

246
00:17:07,355 --> 00:17:11,315
LAURA: Oh! We got music!

247
00:17:11,315 --> 00:17:13,120
ASHLY: This is exciting!

248
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,760
LIAM: There we go!

249
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,256
TRAVIS: Oh man!

250
00:17:16,256 --> 00:17:17,822
LAURA: I'm so nervous!

251
00:17:17,822 --> 00:17:21,721
SAM: I'm nervous for Liam because he has to be
under a lot of pressure right now.

252
00:17:21,721 --> 00:17:23,653
LIAM: Liam's nervous for Liam, too.

253
00:17:23,653 --> 00:17:34,467
For the last 24 hours, the city of Emon has been
blanketed in the heaviest rains in recent memory.

254
00:17:34,467 --> 00:17:39,454
The streets have flooded with water, and the few
residents stubborn enough to brave the elements

255
00:17:39,454 --> 00:17:44,196
hurry as quickly as they can to their
destinations, drenched and chilled to the bone.

256
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:51,502
But not so for you four. One of the Clasp's
countless hidden cells, you've been keeping warm

257
00:17:51,502 --> 00:17:58,847
and cosy in the Diamond Nest tavern, waiting for
word from Spireling Shenn. You already know the

258
00:17:58,847 --> 00:18:05,176
task that awaits you. You've been over it. All
that is left is for the Spireling to set you

259
00:18:05,176 --> 00:18:10,115
loose. The Diamond Nest isn't horribly busy this
evening, but there are a few patrons scattered

260
00:18:10,115 --> 00:18:14,726
about, trying to warm themselves by the fire,
trying to warm themselves with drink. You've been

261
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:20,608
here since the late afternoon, hiding from the
rain, and tedium set in hours ago. You've all been

262
00:18:20,608 --> 00:18:28,458
pretending to nurse the same drinks since the sun
went down, and after minutes of staring at the

263
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:34,608
wall, out of the corner of your eye, Delweth, you
notice the door to the kitchen swing quietly open,

264
00:18:34,608 --> 00:18:41,518
and a familiar figure come strolling over towards
your table in the corner. It's Garthok, a lean

265
00:18:41,518 --> 00:18:46,423
looking half-orc you've run with a handful of
times. The rest of you finally notice him as well,

266
00:18:46,423 --> 00:18:50,667
as he slides up to the table. "Evening, friends."

267
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:52,260
MARY: Hello Garthok.

268
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,895
LIAM: "You all as bored as you look?"

269
00:18:53,895 --> 00:18:56,505
MARY: Pretty much.

270
00:18:56,505 --> 00:19:02,535
LIAM: He looks towards the opaque windows facing
out on the street, the sound of heavy rain

271
00:19:02,535 --> 00:19:08,514
spattering against them. "I'd hate to be the poor
schmucks wandering around out there tonight."

272
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:19,146
(chuckles) He looks back to you. Stares you dead
in the eye. "He's waiting." And with that the

273
00:19:19,146 --> 00:19:26,274
half-orc heads across the tavern and seats himself
at the bar. Over the next few minutes, starting

274
00:19:26,274 --> 00:19:36,295
with Dren, you leave, one at a time, slip through
the kitchen, down into the secret passageway that

275
00:19:36,295 --> 00:19:44,410
leads to the Clasp's headquarters below the
Diamond Nest. And Dren, while you wait for the

276
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:49,967
rest to catch up with you, you make your way down
a long hall, nod at one of your brethren standing,

277
00:19:49,967 --> 00:19:58,142
watching at a door. He unlocks it for you. Past
the door reveals your charge, Devan, lying on a

278
00:19:58,142 --> 00:20:00,968
bed, who sits up and looks at you.

279
00:20:00,968 --> 00:20:10,003
ASHLY: Hi. (giggles) Hi, Devan.

280
00:20:10,003 --> 00:20:11,584
LAURA: What's going on out there?

281
00:20:11,584 --> 00:20:13,707
ASHLY: Oh, we're very bored.

282
00:20:13,707 --> 00:20:14,769
LAURA: Oh, okay.

283
00:20:14,769 --> 00:20:15,641
ASHLY: Yeah.

284
00:20:15,641 --> 00:20:17,412
LAURA: Have you heard anything from Shenn?

285
00:20:17,412 --> 00:20:23,997
ASHLY: No, mostly everyone's been drinking. There
was a half-orc who's a little scary, and I wanted

286
00:20:23,997 --> 00:20:27,841
to see-- do you need anything? Do you need like
food, or water, or--

287
00:20:27,841 --> 00:20:32,174
LAURA: Oh, you're so kind. I think if you brought
me anything they might catch on, though.

288
00:20:32,174 --> 00:20:37,065
ASHLY: Oh, right, okay. I worry about you. You
know, alone, in the dark.

289
00:20:37,065 --> 00:20:42,980
LAURA: I worry about you, too. I think the sooner
that we can get to the house the sooner we can end

290
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,320
all this.

291
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,342
ASHLY: That's true, okay. I wrote a haiku for you,
do you want to hear it?

292
00:20:48,342 --> 00:20:49,697
LAURA: I would love to.

293
00:20:49,697 --> 00:20:53,935
ASHLY: Okay. What's your last name again?

294
00:20:53,935 --> 00:20:57,250
LIAM: "Should I pull up a chair for this and
watch? I could get some popcorn."

295
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:01,985
ASHLY: Oh! Silence prisoner! Hi, sorry.

296
00:21:01,985 --> 00:21:04,056
LAURA: Ow, it hurt when you hit me a second ago.

297
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:08,771
ASHLY: Hi, I was checking--who--how are--

298
00:21:08,771 --> 00:21:10,931
LIAM: "You know the Spireling is waiting for you,
right?"

299
00:21:10,931 --> 00:21:15,493
ASHLY: Oh! I'll go right now, to go-- don't you go
anywhere!

300
00:21:15,493 --> 00:21:16,922
LAURA: (scared sound)

301
00:21:16,922 --> 00:21:19,647
ASHLY: Oh yeah, you better be scared. Yeah, I'm
going, I'm gone.

302
00:21:19,647 --> 00:21:21,503
LIAM: "Bring the girl."

303
00:21:21,503 --> 00:21:25,052
ASHLY: Oh, right. I lock the door and--

304
00:21:25,052 --> 00:21:33,053
LIAM: Everybody else catches up. You all gather
outside of Shen's chamber to wait. Four members of

305
00:21:33,053 --> 00:21:40,773
the Clasp and this yutz. After a while the door
opens and another group of four files out, heading

306
00:21:40,773 --> 00:21:46,617
down the hallway you all came from. And inside you
see Shen, looking down at some parchment spread

307
00:21:46,617 --> 00:21:54,086
out across his table, his red monocle catching a
bit of light from a lantern in the room. "Yes,

308
00:21:54,086 --> 00:22:02,880
"yes, come in. I know you all must have been going
a bit stir-crazy. Come. Right. I had hoped to move

309
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:09,576
"on this last night, but I'm afraid the elder
Bluebutton delayed her departure for a day.

310
00:22:09,576 --> 00:22:17,172
"However, she has finally left for her little
excursion in Vasselheim. We've had her trailed to

311
00:22:17,172 --> 00:22:22,846
"the city limits and beyond. Her house staff is
still on the premises, but they largely keep in

312
00:22:22,846 --> 00:22:27,095
"their separate lodgings for the night. And even if
one of them decides to poke about in the main

313
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:33,881
"house, I'm sure they won't be much of a problem.
Any last questions before I send you out?"

314
00:22:33,881 --> 00:22:38,222
SAM: (exaggerated Russian accent) Obby the Rat has
question.

315
00:22:38,222 --> 00:22:41,252
(laughter)

316
00:22:41,252 --> 00:22:43,330
SAM: Describe item again?

317
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:57,005
LIAM: "All right, I will. It's hard to miss. It's
a gem the size of a skull-- an emerald, as big as

318
00:22:57,005 --> 00:22:58,622
"your head, sir."

319
00:22:58,622 --> 00:23:00,464
SAM: Obby has big head.

320
00:23:00,464 --> 00:23:05,316
LIAM: "That you do. Tarvis, do you have any real
questions, or are you good to go?"

321
00:23:05,316 --> 00:23:08,369
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm ready to roll whenever everyone
else is.

322
00:23:08,369 --> 00:23:11,244
ASHLY: I'm ready.

323
00:23:11,244 --> 00:23:13,005
MARY: Yeah, all right.

324
00:23:13,005 --> 00:23:19,438
LIAM: He walks up to you, Tarvis, and-- right up
close to you-- takes a little latch on your armor

325
00:23:19,438 --> 00:23:25,004
and tightens it and says, "Now, bring me my
prize."

326
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:27,202
TRAVIS: Of course, Spireling.

327
00:23:27,202 --> 00:23:30,001
LIAM: "I know you won't disappoint."

328
00:23:30,001 --> 00:23:32,372
TRAVIS: Never dream of it.

329
00:23:32,372 --> 00:23:41,791
LIAM: He then walks over to you, Devan. "Miss
Bluebutton, I hope you will put your trust in our

330
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:48,873
"very capable hands. I'm sure with your guidance
your grandmother's precautions will pose little

331
00:23:48,873 --> 00:23:56,189
"problem. My people will keep you safe. Just do as
your escorts say, and there's no reason why things

332
00:23:56,189 --> 00:23:59,784
"should go any differently than our little test
runs over the last couple weeks."

333
00:23:59,784 --> 00:24:01,344
LAURA: Okay.

334
00:24:01,344 --> 00:24:09,120
LIAM: "Once Tagmut's Eye sits on this table, you
will be free of your debt, as promised."

335
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,516
LAURA: Thank you.

336
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:20,963
LIAM: "I'm a good judge of character. I've no
doubt you'll do fine. Go."

337
00:24:20,963 --> 00:24:25,213
LAURA: Now?

338
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:30,969
LIAM: You all leave the room, make your way
through the various halls of the Clasp underneath

339
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:39,174
the tavern. And you find the entrance to the
tunnels that connect to the sewers. The drainage

340
00:24:39,174 --> 00:24:46,196
system underneath Emon is vast and labrynthine,
but Obby knows them well. He's traveled through at

341
00:24:46,196 --> 00:24:50,635
least half of it at this point, sleeping below the
streets of the city as much as he has above.

342
00:24:50,635 --> 00:24:56,853
Bluebutton's home-- Adelaide Bluebutton, your
grandmother, the Shrew--

343
00:24:56,853 --> 00:24:59,520
LAURA: She is a shrew.

344
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,699
LIAM: She's over in the Central District. It's a
ways off from the Graveyard District where you're

345
00:25:02,699 --> 00:25:07,618
starting. And even though The Rat hasn't been down
this stretch of tunnelwork before, with maps

346
00:25:07,618 --> 00:25:11,689
procured from city planning, he's able to guide
the party there without any trouble.

347
00:25:11,689 --> 00:25:13,553
SAM: I follow my nose.

348
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:16,849
MARY, LIAM and SAM: It always knows.

349
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:24,947
LIAM: So most of you can see in the dark, but the
two halflings would be blind as a bat, so Devan

350
00:25:24,947 --> 00:25:31,004
and Obby are carrying torches to light the way.
There's also a lot of icky shit in the sewers, so

351
00:25:31,004 --> 00:25:39,036
better to be prepared. And eventually you make
your way to your destination, which is a large

352
00:25:39,036 --> 00:25:49,176
runoff from Adelaide's property. You come up to a
dead-end on a side path in the sewers, two equal

353
00:25:49,176 --> 00:25:55,672
walkways on either side of a canal, and there is a
Shawshank-size pipe coming out of the wall, and

354
00:25:55,672 --> 00:26:01,042
water is rushing out of it at a steady pace
because it is raining cats and dogs outside.

355
00:26:01,042 --> 00:26:02,676
(whispers) I've got rain.

356
00:26:02,676 --> 00:26:05,112
ALL: Ooh!

357
00:26:05,112 --> 00:26:10,765
LIAM; And this is the plan: looking at the
schematics here, you know that the main pipe leads

358
00:26:10,765 --> 00:26:19,574
to two smaller-- big enough for Tarvis, barely--
to shimmy up to two separate runoff drains on her

359
00:26:19,574 --> 00:26:25,357
property. So that's the plan. It might be a little
trickier than anticipated because of the rain, but

360
00:26:25,357 --> 00:26:27,660
you can certainly have at it.

361
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,632
SAM: And we pick one or the other?

362
00:26:29,632 --> 00:26:33,126
LIAM: Well initially it's one, and then it
splits.

363
00:26:33,126 --> 00:26:40,782
TRAVIS: A few marching orders before we begin.
Obby and I work together a lot, so we're familiar

364
00:26:40,782 --> 00:26:42,899
with each other, wouldn't you say?

365
00:26:42,899 --> 00:26:47,051
SAM: Yes, I'd follow you anywhere, Tarvis.

366
00:26:47,051 --> 00:26:48,114
TRAVIS: Anywhere.

367
00:26:48,114 --> 00:26:49,777
SAM: He's very smart.

368
00:26:49,777 --> 00:26:52,201
TRAVIS: Delweth I've been learning a little bit
more about.

369
00:26:52,201 --> 00:26:53,428
MARY: Yeah.

370
00:26:53,428 --> 00:26:57,468
TRAVIS: Dren, not quite so sure what it is that
you do.

371
00:26:57,468 --> 00:27:08,331
ASHLY: Well, I guard Devan, our prisoner. And on
the side I'm a bit of a poet. And I also assassin

372
00:27:08,331 --> 00:27:10,143
people very well.

373
00:27:10,143 --> 00:27:12,576
TRAVIS: Good. How do you like to assassin people?

374
00:27:12,576 --> 00:27:14,825
ASHLY: Stealthily? Usually.

375
00:27:14,825 --> 00:27:16,651
TRAVIS: With your hands?

376
00:27:16,651 --> 00:27:21,193
ASHLY: No, I have like a crossbow type of
situation going on.

377
00:27:21,193 --> 00:27:23,392
TRAVIS: Nice. A little range action.

378
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:24,842
ASHLY: Yeah, yeah.

379
00:27:24,842 --> 00:27:30,597
TRAVIS: Delweth, would you mind sharing with Devan
what exactly you do to people like her in case she

380
00:27:30,597 --> 00:27:33,145
thinks about running off or leaving--

381
00:27:33,145 --> 00:27:34,928
LAURA: I'm not going to run anywhere.

382
00:27:34,928 --> 00:27:36,905
TRAVIS: No, it's a hypothetical deal, you'll enjoy
this.

383
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:39,604
MARY: Starting at the head, or at the feet?

384
00:27:39,604 --> 00:27:41,380
TRAVIS: You know what? Dealer's choice.

385
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,576
MARY: Really?

386
00:27:42,576 --> 00:27:44,106
SAM: Obby prefers the feet.

387
00:27:44,106 --> 00:27:45,186
MARY: All right.

388
00:27:45,186 --> 00:27:46,918
TRAVIS: This is violence, not the other stuff.

389
00:27:46,918 --> 00:27:50,843
ASHLY: Is this really necessary? She's being very
well-behaved.

390
00:27:50,843 --> 00:27:59,337
MARY: You're rather small, so I can't really wear
your skin as a suit, but I could try. Maybe do--

391
00:27:59,337 --> 00:28:02,094
I'd like a skirt, I'd probably make your skin into
a--

392
00:28:02,094 --> 00:28:04,067
ASHLY: Hey guys, maybe we should pick a way to
go!

393
00:28:04,067 --> 00:28:06,192
TRAVIS: That was lovely, thank you for that.

394
00:28:06,192 --> 00:28:07,832
MARY: I could flay you alive.

395
00:28:07,832 --> 00:28:09,116
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's really nice.

396
00:28:09,116 --> 00:28:09,916
SAM: Tarvis.

397
00:28:09,916 --> 00:28:10,881
TRAVIS: Yes?

398
00:28:10,881 --> 00:28:15,625
SAM: Even though this Dren is guarding our
prisoner, we are all allowed to kill her if she

399
00:28:15,625 --> 00:28:17,025
acts up, correct?

400
00:28:17,025 --> 00:28:22,421
TRAVIS: Oh, did I not mention that, in the Clasp,
yes, if you betray one of your own, we will turn

401
00:28:22,421 --> 00:28:24,631
you inside out and wear you as a hat.

402
00:28:24,631 --> 00:28:27,272
MARY: Oh, all right, a hat's all right, too.

403
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:28,420
TRAVIS: But Dren knows that

404
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,457
ASHLY: Yeah, I know that.

405
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:30,880
TRAVIS: You knew that already, didn't you?

406
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,130
ASHLY: Yeah yeah yeah.

407
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:35,144
MARY: She's small too. It'd be a small hat, but a
nice one.

408
00:28:35,144 --> 00:28:36,740
ASHLY: I wouldn't make a very good hat.

409
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:41,863
TRAVIS: Does anyone have a preference? Marching
order into the pipe.

410
00:28:41,863 --> 00:28:44,183
SAM: I will go first.

411
00:28:44,183 --> 00:28:45,616
TRAVIS: Really?

412
00:28:45,616 --> 00:28:50,132
SAM: Yes. Let me tell you story-- you know why
they call me Obby the Rat?

413
00:28:50,132 --> 00:28:52,093
TRAVIS: I mean, I do, you want to tell them?

414
00:28:52,093 --> 00:28:55,607
SAM: Because I am small. Like rat. I go first.

415
00:28:55,607 --> 00:29:03,852
LIAM: Okay. It is not easily walked into, it's
about 15 feet above all your heads. 17 feet above yours.

416
00:29:03,852 --> 00:29:10,678
SAM: I will climb up there. Will it be an easy
climb or difficult climb?

417
00:29:10,678 --> 00:29:12,144
(laughter)

418
00:29:12,144 --> 00:29:14,723
TRAVIS: I'm going to die, I wasn't ready for
this.

419
00:29:14,723 --> 00:29:19,501
SAM: Obby the Rat is now realizing he must
maintain accent for three hours.

420
00:29:19,501 --> 00:29:22,088
(laughter)

421
00:29:22,088 --> 00:29:25,058
SAM: With very limited accent abilities.

422
00:29:25,058 --> 00:29:31,636
LIAM: If you'd like, you can make an acrobatics
check to get up to the pipe.

423
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:38,288
SAM: Hold my torch. Acrobatics. Ooh! 22.

424
00:29:38,288 --> 00:29:46,702
LIAM: Yeah, you are a spry-- you're skinny-mini
for a dwarf. You scrabble up, parkour off of one

425
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:51,593
corner and then leap out and manage to catch with
your hand and hang from it.

426
00:29:51,593 --> 00:29:55,438
SAM: I look back down at them. (clicks tongue)

427
00:29:55,438 --> 00:30:04,772
LIAM: And then you yank your butt up inside. It is
slick and slimy from plant matter that has gone

428
00:30:04,772 --> 00:30:10,416
through here, and also there is water rushing in
your face. You're getting toileted on for the most

429
00:30:10,416 --> 00:30:14,604
part, here. I'd also make a quick strength check
to make sure you don't get flushed out.

430
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:15,960
SAM: Natural 20.

431
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,420
ALL: Wow!

432
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,808
LAURA: Already?

433
00:30:18,808 --> 00:30:21,443
LIAM: Like a cat, you go up on the ends of your
fingers and the ends of your toes and all the

434
00:30:21,443 --> 00:30:28,882
water scoots out under you. Okay, as he scrabbles
up, Delweth, you, bored and not interested in the

435
00:30:28,882 --> 00:30:37,497
dwarf's ass, are staring at the wall, and you
notice off to the side a single brick maybe an

436
00:30:37,497 --> 00:30:43,395
inch out of the wall. It's nothing major, but it
bumps you a little because the rest of the tunnel

437
00:30:43,395 --> 00:30:46,092
is pretty level and clean.

438
00:30:46,092 --> 00:30:52,149
MARY: I'm going to kill the party in the first
five minutes. Can I do a perception check?

439
00:30:52,149 --> 00:30:54,218
LIAM: Sure.

440
00:30:54,218 --> 00:31:00,663
MARY: 13.

441
00:31:00,663 --> 00:31:07,286
LIAM: Yeah, without touching it, you get a bit
closer and can see that it is loose. That's going

442
00:31:07,286 --> 00:31:09,902
to slide right in and out.

443
00:31:09,902 --> 00:31:11,195
MARY: Hmm.

444
00:31:11,195 --> 00:31:12,451
TRAVIS: Brick in the wall?

445
00:31:12,451 --> 00:31:13,683
MARY: Yeah. Tarvis?

446
00:31:13,683 --> 00:31:18,188
LIAM: We'll call that checking for traps as well.
You don't see anything hinky.

447
00:31:18,188 --> 00:31:19,624
TRAVIS: Yes, dear.

448
00:31:19,624 --> 00:31:21,036
MARY: Tarvis, did you see this?

449
00:31:21,036 --> 00:31:22,266
TRAVIS: I do.

450
00:31:22,266 --> 00:31:24,810
MARY: What do you think, Oh Great Leader?

451
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:27,230
TRAVIS: Hmm. You think it's trapped?

452
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:29,016
MARY: I do, actually.

453
00:31:29,016 --> 00:31:31,525
TRAVIS: Maybe we should have Dren touch it.

454
00:31:31,525 --> 00:31:32,775
MARY: Yeah.

455
00:31:32,775 --> 00:31:37,330
ASHLY: Sure. I'll touch it.

456
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,907
TRAVIS: You will?

457
00:31:38,907 --> 00:31:46,127
ASHLY: Well, once you guys are all up there. What
do we think it would be? Do we have to touch it?

458
00:31:46,127 --> 00:31:48,092
MARY: No, we don't have to touch it.

459
00:31:48,092 --> 00:31:49,860
LAURA: It's not trapped!

460
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:56,171
TRAVIS: Did you want to give it a touch? Oh!

461
00:31:56,171 --> 00:32:03,575
LIAM: You pull and not one brick, but four bricks
all connected come out and uncover a flatter stone

462
00:32:03,575 --> 00:32:08,933
surface inside. And you're right up against it now
and you see a very familiar circular insignia

463
00:32:08,933 --> 00:32:18,173
there of a rodent curled in on itself in a little
ball. You know this. This is your grandmother's sign.

464
00:32:18,173 --> 00:32:19,554
LAURA: Siggle?

465
00:32:19,554 --> 00:32:21,119
LIAM: This is a house seal. It's a siggle.

466
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:22,544
MARY: Siggle.

467
00:32:22,544 --> 00:32:26,637
LIAM: It's the siggle of the shrew!

468
00:32:26,637 --> 00:32:31,007
LAURA: (gasp) I wonder if it works the way it does
upstairs.

469
00:32:31,007 --> 00:32:33,456
TRAVIS: How does it work upstairs?

470
00:32:33,456 --> 00:32:38,362
LAURA: I pull out my dagger and I cut my hand with
it.

471
00:32:38,362 --> 00:32:39,801
SAM: Whoa!

472
00:32:39,801 --> 00:32:42,368
LAURA: And I stick it on there. Anything?

473
00:32:42,368 --> 00:32:48,177
LIAM: Yes, you remember how this works. It doesn't
happen instantly, but you feel the blood seep from

474
00:32:48,177 --> 00:32:53,125
your hand into it. It stings a little bit, but
it's not too bad. And after like 20 seconds,

475
00:32:53,125 --> 00:33:05,194
enough blood is pulled out and you hear a little
(click) and the seal spins a quarter inch. And the

476
00:33:05,194 --> 00:33:09,502
door-- because it's a door-- pushes a little bit
in.

477
00:33:09,502 --> 00:33:13,458
ASHLY: Ha! See? Yeah, it wasn't a trap. Good job,
Devan!

478
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:14,859
LAURA: Thanks!

479
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:16,076
TRAVIS: Good job, Devan.

480
00:33:16,076 --> 00:33:17,191
LAURA: Thanks.

481
00:33:17,191 --> 00:33:18,302
TRAVIS: Proving useful.

482
00:33:18,302 --> 00:33:23,075
LAURA: I am useful! Also, I cast Dancing Lights
and throw my torch on the ground.

483
00:33:23,075 --> 00:33:27,874
LIAM: Okay. Rolls into the canal, goes out, floats
away, down in the rainwater.

484
00:33:27,874 --> 00:33:30,661
LAURA: See guys?

485
00:33:30,661 --> 00:33:35,633
LIAM: And four beautiful globes of light swirl
around Devan and light up, and shadows sparkle all

486
00:33:35,633 --> 00:33:37,472
around you. It's like a little disco--

487
00:33:37,472 --> 00:33:39,020
TRAVIS: Was that our only torch?

488
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,710
LIAM: --in the sewer. No, Obby's got one.

489
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:41,861
MARY: No, we have two.

490
00:33:41,861 --> 00:33:43,371
LAURA: Why do you need another torch?

491
00:33:43,371 --> 00:33:45,733
ASHLY: So does the door open all the way? Or a
little bit?

492
00:33:45,733 --> 00:33:47,003
LIAM: I don't know.

493
00:33:47,003 --> 00:33:48,600
MARY: Oi. Devan.

494
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,633
LAURA: Huh?

495
00:33:49,633 --> 00:33:51,885
MARY: Next time you think to throw something away,
check with us first, please?

496
00:33:51,885 --> 00:33:53,583
LAURA: Okay, but I've got lots of light, though.

497
00:33:53,583 --> 00:33:55,019
MARY: I'm so glad.

498
00:33:55,019 --> 00:33:59,069
TRAVIS: Hat, remember. She'll wear you as a hat.

499
00:33:59,069 --> 00:34:02,547
MARY: Skirt, actually. Yeah. With pleats.

500
00:34:02,547 --> 00:34:04,967
TRAVIS: Could I check the partially open door?

501
00:34:04,967 --> 00:34:07,902
LIAM: Sure. You want to check it for danger?

502
00:34:07,902 --> 00:34:10,544
TRAVIS: I would like to check it for danger.

503
00:34:10,544 --> 00:34:13,887
LIAM: Sure, make a danger check. Also known as
perception.

504
00:34:13,887 --> 00:34:15,259
TRAVIS: Oh, perception.

505
00:34:15,259 --> 00:34:18,448
SAM: Not great.

506
00:34:18,448 --> 00:34:19,935
TRAVIS: Seven.

507
00:34:19,935 --> 00:34:24,121
LIAM: It looks good. I mean you'd know if there
was something wrong with this. Seems fine. I mean

508
00:34:24,121 --> 00:34:25,546
it's a door, right? Doors open and close.

509
00:34:25,546 --> 00:34:26,991
TRAVIS: They sure do.

510
00:34:26,991 --> 00:34:29,278
ASHLY: Can I check to see if I can fit through
it?

511
00:34:29,278 --> 00:34:35,619
LIAM: You can almost fit through it. It catches on
your armor a bit so you're through and it feels

512
00:34:35,619 --> 00:34:38,243
cool. And it's dark in there, you can't see shit
in there.

513
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:40,168
LAURA: Oh, I send one of the dancing lights in
with her.

514
00:34:40,168 --> 00:34:45,302
LIAM: Okay. It floats in past and you looking
through can see the light-- the tunnel curves to

515
00:34:45,302 --> 00:34:51,790
the right, and it goes around the corner, and you
see the light go (whoosh). Also, shimmying around

516
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:56,825
like this, the door goes a little bit further and
opens. It almost feels like it's on some sort of track or

517
00:34:56,825 --> 00:35:01,970
rollers. And it slides back a little bit further.
And follows you in a bit. And there's actually a

518
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:05,233
way to step over to the right and go around. And
you're in.

519
00:35:05,233 --> 00:35:07,272
ASHLY: I'm in, guys!

520
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:10,856
TRAVIS: Well. Keep it up. We'll follow you.

521
00:35:10,856 --> 00:35:13,265
ASHLY: Can I borrow a torch or something?

522
00:35:13,265 --> 00:35:15,337
LAURA: I send another dancing light in.

523
00:35:15,337 --> 00:35:16,805
ASHLY: Thanks Devan.

524
00:35:16,805 --> 00:35:17,965
LAURA: You're welcome.

525
00:35:17,965 --> 00:35:19,998
LIAM: A little gold ball dancing around the top of
your head right now.

526
00:35:19,998 --> 00:35:22,024
MARY: Check the walls for a torch.

527
00:35:22,024 --> 00:35:26,602
ASHLY: My perception is not great, but should I
roll?

528
00:35:26,602 --> 00:35:28,302
LIAM: You can. You don't see anything here.

529
00:35:28,302 --> 00:35:29,660
ASHLY: I don't see anything here?

530
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:35,661
LIAM: It's a plain, flat, smooth, not curved but
goes straight and then angles, and then angles

531
00:35:35,661 --> 00:35:37,379
again, and you can't see around the corner.

532
00:35:37,379 --> 00:35:39,257
ASHLY: Okay, so I could walk down.

533
00:35:39,257 --> 00:35:45,036
SAM: I stick my head out of the pipe, and say, I
think it found where it splits into two. I'm

534
00:35:45,036 --> 00:35:51,804
covered in mostly number ones, a few number twos.
We can make it through here, it will be very

535
00:35:51,804 --> 00:35:54,279
difficult, though. Where are you all?

536
00:35:54,279 --> 00:35:57,827
TRAVIS: Obby?

537
00:35:57,827 --> 00:35:58,899
SAM: What?

538
00:35:58,899 --> 00:36:00,539
TRAVIS: We found a secret door.

539
00:36:00,539 --> 00:36:04,793
SAM: I can come down from the number one and
number two place?

540
00:36:04,793 --> 00:36:07,621
TRAVIS: We should leave him up there.

541
00:36:07,621 --> 00:36:08,993
MARY: You want to?

542
00:36:08,993 --> 00:36:11,603
TRAVIS: No, you can come down from the number one
and number two place.

543
00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:15,381
SAM: All right, Tarvis. I jump down.

544
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:19,737
LIAM: Okay. Despite being covered in-- it's not a
lot of poo or anything.

545
00:36:19,737 --> 00:36:22,158
SAM and ASHLY: Mostly number one.

546
00:36:22,158 --> 00:36:28,586
LIAM: You land and do a nice little dwarven
three-point landing on one of the pathways. And

547
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:32,064
now you three are standing there. You're at the
edge, and you're inside.

548
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:36,792
MARY: Are there bricks around the door, or do we
need to--

549
00:36:36,792 --> 00:36:41,277
LIAM: Yeah, you know that scene in Labyrinth where
she's running down that long brick passage--

550
00:36:41,277 --> 00:36:42,676
LAURA: And the thing goes (spinning)?

551
00:36:42,676 --> 00:36:45,595
LIAM: No, the one where it keeps going forever and
she can't find any doors. It's like that. I mean,

552
00:36:45,595 --> 00:36:51,606
where the door was is uneven, there's teeth of bricks
sticking out the sides, and the whole thing moved

553
00:36:51,606 --> 00:36:53,692
in straight.

554
00:36:53,692 --> 00:36:55,266
LAURA: So it's a door.

555
00:36:55,266 --> 00:36:59,785
LIAM: Yeah, it doesn't come out, it goes in. And
Dren was able to go (whoop).

556
00:36:59,785 --> 00:37:02,152
MARY: Does the door keep moving all the way down
the hallway?

557
00:37:02,152 --> 00:37:03,782
LIAM: I don't know.

558
00:37:03,782 --> 00:37:09,795
TRAVIS: Devan, those dancing lights are awfully
cute. Do you mind if I ask you how you came to be

559
00:37:09,795 --> 00:37:11,743
in the service of the Clasp?

560
00:37:11,743 --> 00:37:13,333
LAURA: Oh!

561
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:17,892
LIAM: Let me re-jigger your memory, Tarvis. She's
not in the Clasp--

562
00:37:17,892 --> 00:37:20,607
TRAVIS: No. Why you're indebted to the Clasp?

563
00:37:20,607 --> 00:37:29,509
LAURA: Oh, well. Yeah, well. So you know,
gambling, huh?

564
00:37:29,509 --> 00:37:31,013
ASHLY: I know gambling.

565
00:37:31,013 --> 00:37:32,182
LAURA: How fun is that?

566
00:37:32,182 --> 00:37:33,502
ASHLY: It's so fun!

567
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:34,497
TRAVIS: Dren.

568
00:37:34,497 --> 00:37:35,545
ASHLY: Sorry.

569
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:42,996
LAURA: But sometimes it gets you into trouble. And
sometimes you can't pay off all your bills. And

570
00:37:42,996 --> 00:37:48,798
sometimes your grandma has a lot of gold and some
treasure. And I said it and the Clasp heard me and

571
00:37:48,798 --> 00:37:55,470
now I'm stuck with you guys. But I'm totally on
board and I'm real excited to help you out and be

572
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:57,946
free of you at the same time.

573
00:37:57,946 --> 00:38:03,348
TRAVIS: Boy golly gosh, that sounds so nice. Do me
a favor. Gamble on your own time, don't gamble

574
00:38:03,348 --> 00:38:08,975
with our lives. We work as a team here, so those
dancing lights down here are fine, but you check

575
00:38:08,975 --> 00:38:14,309
with Dren or her or him before you do that again.
We clear?

576
00:38:14,309 --> 00:38:15,832
LAURA: Sure.

577
00:38:15,832 --> 00:38:19,415
TRAVIS: Good. Give Obby a hug for checking out
that dangerous pipe for you.

578
00:38:19,415 --> 00:38:21,724
MARY: He's covered in number one.

579
00:38:21,724 --> 00:38:28,678
SAM: It's okay, I am frequently used as
punishment.

580
00:38:28,678 --> 00:38:33,962
ASHLY: You get used to it.

581
00:38:33,962 --> 00:38:44,630
TRAVIS: I would like to stealth into the doorway
and, moving forward, be on the alert for traps.

582
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:46,692
LIAM: Okay. Would everyone like to make a stealth
check?

583
00:38:46,692 --> 00:38:48,031
MARY: Yes.

584
00:38:48,031 --> 00:38:52,048
TRAVIS: I don't normally stealth, so that's a
weird sentence for me.

585
00:38:52,048 --> 00:38:55,925
LIAM: I know. Nor do you have an intelligence of
18, but it's going really well.

586
00:38:55,925 --> 00:38:58,847
TRAVIS: I'm trying not to speak as Grog.

587
00:38:58,847 --> 00:39:00,158
SAM: 16.

588
00:39:00,158 --> 00:39:01,651
ASHLY: 24.

589
00:39:01,651 --> 00:39:02,906
MARY: 26.

590
00:39:02,906 --> 00:39:03,878
TRAVIS: 18.

591
00:39:03,878 --> 00:39:05,297
LAURA: 17.

592
00:39:05,297 --> 00:39:10,833
LIAM: 17, okay. And yeah, I would like a marching
order, so how are you guys going in?

593
00:39:10,833 --> 00:39:12,275
TRAVIS: I'll be first through the door.

594
00:39:12,275 --> 00:39:13,597
MARY: I'll be last.

595
00:39:13,597 --> 00:39:15,369
SAM: I'll be number two.

596
00:39:15,369 --> 00:39:18,432
LAURA: I'll be behind Dren then.

597
00:39:18,432 --> 00:39:24,172
LIAM: Okay. You've got a very scary elf behind
you.

598
00:39:24,172 --> 00:39:25,289
LAURA: Yeah.

599
00:39:25,289 --> 00:39:34,429
LIAM: Yeah. All right, so very quietly, even your
gambling charge here, slowly creep around the door

600
00:39:34,429 --> 00:39:40,299
and curve around the side. And it is pitch black
in here. You guys are fine, you can see in low

601
00:39:40,299 --> 00:39:47,551
light and pitch black. It's pitch black in here,
or it was. And you see the tunnel stretch on

602
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:55,036
really far. You can see maybe 40 or 50 or 60 feet
ahead of you, but it keeps going and goes (whoosh)

603
00:39:55,036 --> 00:39:59,982
into black. It's a long tunnel, and there's
nothing. It's very nondescript.

604
00:39:59,982 --> 00:40:02,666
MARY: We still have one torch lit, yeah?

605
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:08,396
LAURA: And three dancing balls of light. Can I ask
a question?

606
00:40:08,396 --> 00:40:09,313
LIAM: Yeah.

607
00:40:09,313 --> 00:40:11,304
LAURA: Cantrips.

608
00:40:11,304 --> 00:40:12,267
LIAM: Yes?

609
00:40:12,267 --> 00:40:13,704
LAURA: How many do I get?

610
00:40:13,704 --> 00:40:14,661
SAM: All.

611
00:40:14,661 --> 00:40:15,922
LAURA: I just can do them?

612
00:40:15,922 --> 00:40:17,118
LIAM: All you want.

613
00:40:17,118 --> 00:40:18,186
LAURA: This is amazing!

614
00:40:18,186 --> 00:40:19,862
LIAM: You can make it rain with cantrips.

615
00:40:19,862 --> 00:40:22,607
MARY: Seriously. All day long, all night.

616
00:40:22,607 --> 00:40:25,398
LAURA: Make it hail, baby. All right. That's gold
coins.

617
00:40:25,398 --> 00:40:31,740
SAM: As much as I don't want to rely on our
prisoner, this would be a good opportunity to

618
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,694
throw a light down the hallway.

619
00:40:33,694 --> 00:40:36,921
TRAVIS: I suppose you're right, Obby, maybe you
should be the one to let her know that she can.

620
00:40:36,921 --> 00:40:39,572
SAM: Obby says do magic trick.

621
00:40:39,572 --> 00:40:42,308
LAURA: Go down the hallway.

622
00:40:42,308 --> 00:40:43,515
SAM: Thank you.

623
00:40:43,515 --> 00:40:48,458
LIAM: A little ball swirls in a spiral down the
hall, and you watch this little circle, like a

624
00:40:48,458 --> 00:40:50,812
firefly, go further and further.

625
00:40:50,812 --> 00:40:52,805
LAURA: It's 120 foot range.

626
00:40:52,805 --> 00:40:58,550
LIAM: Yeah. It keeps going, and then starts to
dim, and then you lose sight of it.

627
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:00,310
LAURA: Come back!

628
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:02,421
LIAM: And you wanted to check for traps, here,
right?

629
00:41:02,421 --> 00:41:03,429
TRAVIS: Yeah.

630
00:41:03,429 --> 00:41:06,946
LIAM: Make a perception check.

631
00:41:06,946 --> 00:41:08,425
TRAVIS: 16.

632
00:41:08,425 --> 00:41:16,070
LIAM: Okay. From where you are, it's a smooth,
flat tunnel. It's plain. You guys want to move

633
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,317
forward?

634
00:41:17,317 --> 00:41:20,415
MARY: I pull out my rapier and hold it as we
proceed.

635
00:41:20,415 --> 00:41:27,893
LIAM: Okay. All right. So you move forward, in a
little conga line, down this tunnel. And it takes

636
00:41:27,893 --> 00:41:34,925
a while. You're walking. The sound of the rain,
once I adjust, vanishes behind you. Come on,

637
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:36,916
buddy, there you go.

638
00:41:36,916 --> 00:41:44,200
LAURA: As we're walking, can I make the four
lights combine together, in the shape of a human,

639
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,531
all the way down at the end of the hallway?

640
00:41:46,531 --> 00:41:48,173
LIAM: Sure, in a rough--

641
00:41:48,173 --> 00:41:50,737
LAURA: Yeah, it makes a humanoid form, yeah.

642
00:41:50,737 --> 00:41:54,433
LIAM: Like one of those plastic signs that's
shaped like a person on the street, saying like

643
00:41:54,433 --> 00:41:56,177
don't walk here because you'll slip.

644
00:41:56,177 --> 00:41:59,079
LAURA: It says you can, into a vaguely humanoid
form.

645
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:00,515
LIAM: Yeah, that's vague.

646
00:42:00,515 --> 00:42:01,329
LAURA: Yeah.

647
00:42:01,329 --> 00:42:03,646
LIAM: So yeah, you've got a gingerbread-shaped
light man.

648
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,242
LAURA: Okay. Down at the end of the hallway.

649
00:42:05,242 --> 00:42:12,560
LIAM: Okay. He's standing there, like this, and
goes-- And you can see him, you moved far enough

650
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:20,955
along, you've probably gone about 100 feet at this
point. You can continue to walk on down, or--

651
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:24,375
MARY: Tarvis? How are the traps looking? You
seeing anything up front?

652
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,206
TRAVIS: Nothing yet, my dear.

653
00:42:26,206 --> 00:42:28,696
ASHLY: Do you guys want to hear a haiku I wrote?

654
00:42:28,696 --> 00:42:30,243
TRAVIS: A haiku?

655
00:42:30,243 --> 00:42:31,465
ASHLY: Yeah.

656
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:33,154
MARY: What the fuck is a haiku?

657
00:42:33,154 --> 00:42:34,233
ASHLY: It's like a poem.

658
00:42:34,233 --> 00:42:36,209
SAM: It's a 7/5/7 meter poem.

659
00:42:36,209 --> 00:42:37,992
TRAVIS: Obby!

660
00:42:37,992 --> 00:42:40,353
ASHLY: Well, 5/7/5.

661
00:42:40,353 --> 00:42:43,323
SAM: Not where I'm from.

662
00:42:43,323 --> 00:42:48,373
TRAVIS: Sure, Dren, we'd love to hear one.

663
00:42:48,373 --> 00:42:53,736
ASHLY: Thanks, Tarvis! Wow, I really didn't think
you were going to go for that. Okay. We walk down

664
00:42:53,736 --> 00:43:01,079
a thing. There is a bright man here too. We are
all much friends.

665
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:03,148
SAM: You wrote that?

666
00:43:03,148 --> 00:43:04,061
ASHLY: Yeah.

667
00:43:04,061 --> 00:43:05,303
SAM: Ahead of time?

668
00:43:05,303 --> 00:43:07,324
ASHLY: Yeah! I worked on it really hard.

669
00:43:07,324 --> 00:43:08,684
MARY: How long?

670
00:43:08,684 --> 00:43:10,398
ASHLY: Couple hours?

671
00:43:10,398 --> 00:43:15,371
LIAM: As you're having this little walk-and-talk,
down the hallway, Tarvis, you feel a little

672
00:43:15,371 --> 00:43:16,806
(click) under your foot.

673
00:43:16,806 --> 00:43:18,884
TRAVIS: Don't. Move.

674
00:43:18,884 --> 00:43:20,541
MARY: What is it?

675
00:43:20,541 --> 00:43:24,145
TRAVIS: I stepped on something that clicked.

676
00:43:24,145 --> 00:43:28,132
MARY: Who's got the torch? You do? Put it down by
your feet. What do you see?

677
00:43:28,132 --> 00:43:29,678
TRAVIS: What do I see?

678
00:43:29,678 --> 00:43:37,235
LIAM: You see one tile, pushed diagonally down
about a half inch in. In a real odd way.

679
00:43:37,235 --> 00:43:43,510
TRAVIS: Real quick, everybody check the walls,
ceilings, floors, see what this might unleash.

680
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:45,814
LIAM: Everybody make a perception check.

681
00:43:45,814 --> 00:43:48,209
TRAVIS: 18.

682
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:49,394
ASHLY: 13.

683
00:43:49,394 --> 00:43:51,624
LAURA: Four.

684
00:43:51,624 --> 00:43:53,402
MARY: 17.

685
00:43:53,402 --> 00:43:54,669
SAM: Four.

686
00:43:54,669 --> 00:43:56,076
LIAM: Devan, you-- no.

687
00:43:56,076 --> 00:43:58,123
MARY: 17.

688
00:43:58,123 --> 00:44:03,580
LIAM: Who got the 18? You got the 18? Okay. You
guys both look everywhere, look all around, look

689
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:09,536
up, and starting right above you, Tarvis, and
stretching about 20 feet along the roof of this

690
00:44:09,536 --> 00:44:15,249
tunnel, are maybe 100 tiny holes in the ceiling.

691
00:44:15,249 --> 00:44:21,701
LAURA: Is it behind us too, or just in front of
us?

692
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:25,562
LIAM: It starts above Tarvis.

693
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:27,314
TRAVIS: The duration of the hallway?

694
00:44:27,314 --> 00:44:28,995
LIAM: Right where Tarvis is. Right where he has
stepped.

695
00:44:28,995 --> 00:44:31,537
LAURA: We could back up? We could just back up,
then.

696
00:44:31,537 --> 00:44:34,870
SAM: We hold Devan above us as a human shield and
keep running.

697
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:42,861
LAURA: That's not smart! I'm the only one that can
get you to the actual thing that you need!

698
00:44:42,861 --> 00:44:47,717
MARY: Can I do a perception check to see how much
weight pressure it would need to keep the tile down?

699
00:44:47,717 --> 00:44:49,059
LIAM: Make an investigation check.

700
00:44:49,059 --> 00:44:50,211
MARY: Investigation check?

701
00:44:50,211 --> 00:44:53,797
LAURA: While she's looking at it, I'm going to
send a message to--

702
00:44:53,797 --> 00:44:55,510
MARY: That's a natural one.

703
00:44:55,510 --> 00:45:02,033
LAURA: --to Dren. No one else can hear. I'm going
to say: Hey! I'm thinking they might be catching

704
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:07,184
on to something, so maybe it would be smart if we
pretended that we didn't like each other a little

705
00:45:07,184 --> 00:45:09,570
bit more than we have been.

706
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:13,212
ASHLY: I know, I'm sorry, I'm trying really hard,
I just like you a lot!

707
00:45:13,212 --> 00:45:14,817
LAURA: I know, I like you so much!

708
00:45:14,817 --> 00:45:16,886
ASHLY: Okay should I be meaner to you?

709
00:45:16,886 --> 00:45:19,231
LAURA: Yeah maybe a little mean so they're not
catching on as much.

710
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:20,830
ASHLY: Okay. Let's use her as a human shield!

711
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:22,139
LAURA: Oh no!

712
00:45:22,139 --> 00:45:24,015
TARVIS: Wow, Dren, that was really drastic.

713
00:45:24,015 --> 00:45:25,076
ASHLY: Yeah!

714
00:45:25,076 --> 00:45:27,233
TARVIS: Okay. Would you like to hold her up?

715
00:45:27,233 --> 00:45:30,244
ASHLY: Sure! Okay.

716
00:45:30,244 --> 00:45:33,381
LAURA: That was maybe a bit too much--

717
00:45:33,381 --> 00:45:35,642
TRAVIS: Maybe not, Dren. I like your enthusiasm,
though.

718
00:45:35,642 --> 00:45:36,796
ASHLY: Thanks.

719
00:45:36,796 --> 00:45:37,923
TRAVIS: Yeah. Devan?

720
00:45:37,923 --> 00:45:38,997
LAURA: Yeah?

721
00:45:38,997 --> 00:45:40,718
TRAVIS: You have some tricks about you, right?

722
00:45:40,718 --> 00:45:41,879
LAURA: Yes, I do.

723
00:45:41,879 --> 00:45:43,883
TRAVIS: Any favorite spells that you like to use?

724
00:45:43,883 --> 00:45:45,688
LAURA: Nothing that'll work on these things.

725
00:45:45,688 --> 00:45:47,018
TRAVIS: The holes?

726
00:45:47,018 --> 00:45:53,423
LAURA: Holes? On this trap? I can try casting Ray
of Frost on the tile and freeze it in place.

727
00:45:53,423 --> 00:45:55,759
SAM: That's pretty smart.

728
00:45:55,759 --> 00:46:01,473
LAURA: I mean, it might work. I can try it.

729
00:46:01,473 --> 00:46:03,152
LIAM: That's true, it might work, and you can try
it.

730
00:46:03,152 --> 00:46:06,320
TRAVIS: One could say, you can certainly try.

731
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:13,502
LAURA: But Tarvis, in doing so, I might actually
hurt your foot. But I don't want you to blame me,

732
00:46:13,502 --> 00:46:16,877
because I'm just doing it because I'm trying to
freeze the thing.

733
00:46:16,877 --> 00:46:18,516
TRAVIS: I appreciate your concern.

734
00:46:18,516 --> 00:46:22,926
MARY: Well let's have a think for a moment, right?
So it's not behind us, there's nothing in the

735
00:46:22,926 --> 00:46:24,744
ceiling behind us, it's just ahead of us.

736
00:46:24,744 --> 00:46:26,012
LIAM: You don't see anything behind.

737
00:46:26,012 --> 00:46:27,000
MARY: Little holes.

738
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,487
LIAM: The holes stretch above Tarvis for 15 or 20
feet.

739
00:46:29,487 --> 00:46:31,035
MARY: 15 or 20 feet. All right.

740
00:46:31,035 --> 00:46:32,659
SAM: We could all go, leaving Tarvis here.

741
00:46:32,659 --> 00:46:38,140
MARY: Well what I was thinking, was what if I cast
Mage Hand and pushed down on the tile, you take a

742
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:43,436
step back, and we see what happens? And if it
holds, then we can move forward, because the Mage

743
00:46:43,436 --> 00:46:46,925
Hand will last for 30 feet, and we'll be beyond
the 20 feet of ceiling shite.

744
00:46:46,925 --> 00:46:48,124
LAURA: That's really smart!

745
00:46:48,124 --> 00:46:49,267
TRAVIS: Objections?

746
00:46:49,267 --> 00:46:52,041
ASHLY: Do we know that it only goes on for 20 more
feet? This tunnel?

747
00:46:52,041 --> 00:46:58,161
LIAM: The tunnel goes for another, I don't know,
100, 150 feet, but the holes that they noticed

748
00:46:58,161 --> 00:47:03,994
above Tarvis and moving about stop after about 15,
20 feet ahead.

749
00:47:03,994 --> 00:47:06,754
TRAVIS: I like your idea. Devan.

750
00:47:06,754 --> 00:47:07,907
LAURA: What?

751
00:47:07,907 --> 00:47:11,050
TRAVIS: How about you use your Ray of Frost on the
holes, so that if anything decides to drop out of

752
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:13,000
them, it meets a little stopper.

753
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:19,149
LAURA: Do you want to pick me up? Because I'm
short.

754
00:47:19,149 --> 00:47:20,711
MARY: Let Dren do it.

755
00:47:20,711 --> 00:47:22,000
TRAVIS and LAURA: She's also pretty short.

756
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,880
TRAVIS: Sure, Devan, I would like to do that.

757
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,432
LAURA: Thank you.

758
00:47:26,432 --> 00:47:27,972
ASHLY: I mean, don't get any ideas.

759
00:47:27,972 --> 00:47:31,337
TRAVIS: Shall we?

760
00:47:31,337 --> 00:47:32,376
MARY: Yes.

761
00:47:32,376 --> 00:47:37,379
LAURA: As we go, I hit a Ray of Frost. Okay.

762
00:47:37,379 --> 00:47:43,546
MARY: I cast Mage Hand, and place the Mage Hand,
direct it towards the tile that Tarvis is standing on.

763
00:47:43,546 --> 00:47:46,630
LIAM: Okay. And we're moving forward?

764
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:47,802
MARY: Nope!

765
00:47:47,802 --> 00:47:51,143
TRAVIS: As it appears, we'd like to do the old
Indiana Jones like foot off--

766
00:47:51,143 --> 00:47:57,281
MARY: Foot off, put on, and they take a step back,
as she casts Ray of Frost to see whether or not

767
00:47:57,281 --> 00:47:58,603
it'll hold.

768
00:47:58,603 --> 00:48:00,134
SAM: Obby the Rat runs.

769
00:48:00,134 --> 00:48:00,923
LIAM: Forward?

770
00:48:00,923 --> 00:48:01,946
SAM: Forward.

771
00:48:01,946 --> 00:48:03,202
LIAM: Forward?

772
00:48:03,202 --> 00:48:04,780
SAM: This will not work. I run.

773
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:06,374
MARY: There's nothing behind us, Obby.

774
00:48:06,374 --> 00:48:09,304
LIAM: Obby bolts to the side of Tarvis and books
it down the hall.

775
00:48:09,304 --> 00:48:10,370
TRAVIS: Obby!

776
00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:13,475
LIAM: He makes it like 15 feet, and you hear
another little (click), and immediately acid

777
00:48:13,475 --> 00:48:15,224
starts spilling out of all the holes.

778
00:48:15,224 --> 00:48:16,379
LAURA: Shit!

779
00:48:16,379 --> 00:48:18,058
LIAM: Obby, Tarvis.

780
00:48:18,058 --> 00:48:26,577
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch! Like trickles of acid, or
like a shower of acid?

781
00:48:26,577 --> 00:48:28,281
LIAM: A little spew of acid.

782
00:48:28,281 --> 00:48:30,115
MARY: So before you even got to step back?

783
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:31,075
TRAVIS: Yep.

784
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:32,799
MARY: That's shit. Well done, Obby.

785
00:48:32,799 --> 00:48:35,272
LIAM: Both of you make a dexterity check.

786
00:48:35,272 --> 00:48:36,773
SAM: Who, me, or them?

787
00:48:36,773 --> 00:48:37,997
TRAVIS: You!

788
00:48:37,997 --> 00:48:39,383
LIAM: Both of you.

789
00:48:39,383 --> 00:48:41,639
LAURA: Am I on his shoulders at this point
already?

790
00:48:41,639 --> 00:48:42,728
LIAM: Who picked you up, Tarvis did?

791
00:48:42,728 --> 00:48:43,601
ASHLY: Tarvis did.

792
00:48:43,601 --> 00:48:44,949
LIAM: Yes, you make a dexterity check as well.

793
00:48:44,949 --> 00:48:46,022
LAURA: Fuck!

794
00:48:46,022 --> 00:48:47,892
SAM: Me too?

795
00:48:47,892 --> 00:48:48,782
LIAM: Yeah.

796
00:48:48,782 --> 00:48:49,770
SAM: 25.

797
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:50,659
TRAVIS: 13.

798
00:48:50,659 --> 00:48:51,755
LIAM: Was your dex check?

799
00:48:51,755 --> 00:48:52,773
SAM: Yes.

800
00:48:52,773 --> 00:48:53,769
LIAM: And you got what?

801
00:48:53,769 --> 00:48:54,610
TRAVIS: 13.

802
00:48:54,610 --> 00:48:55,612
LIAM: And you got?

803
00:48:55,612 --> 00:48:56,617
LAURA: 19.

804
00:48:56,617 --> 00:49:00,989
LIAM: 19, okay. Boy, this is crazy. Obby, hears
like (hissing) and you do a dive and roll, and you

805
00:49:00,989 --> 00:49:04,783
feel a little drop of something splattering
against your butt and burning into the seat of

806
00:49:04,783 --> 00:49:09,742
your pants a little bit. You immediately hear
(hissing), and you wriggle free, like a cat, and

807
00:49:09,742 --> 00:49:16,180
scratch down along the side of Tarvis, and Tarvis,
you take a big ol' dump of acid on your head, and

808
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:18,764
take seven points of acid damage.

809
00:49:18,764 --> 00:49:19,803
TRAVIS: Seven?

810
00:49:19,803 --> 00:49:20,784
LIAM: Yeah.

811
00:49:20,784 --> 00:49:23,808
TRAVIS: Oh Jesus. I miss Grog right now!

812
00:49:23,808 --> 00:49:30,434
LIAM: You're burned, you've got holes burned into
your armor and into your shoulder, and it's still

813
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:31,724
stinging.

814
00:49:31,724 --> 00:49:33,886
ASHLY: Are you okay, Tarvis?

815
00:49:33,886 --> 00:49:41,216
TRAVIS: Oh, you know, I need a word with my good
friend, Obby. Just a quick chat. Would you mind

816
00:49:41,216 --> 00:49:43,750
waiting here for one second? Will you keep your
finger on the button?

817
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:45,040
SAM: Is the acid still going?

818
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:49,489
LIAM: No, it was about a ten second pee of acid
from the holes.

819
00:49:49,489 --> 00:49:54,442
TRAVIS: Can I make my way up to Obby, hopscotching
over the puddles of acid that I can see?

820
00:49:54,442 --> 00:49:58,031
LIAM: Yes, yeah you can hear under your shoe is
going (sizzling).

821
00:49:58,031 --> 00:49:59,664
TRAVIS: Obby, hey, Obby.

822
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:01,637
SAM: I'm sorry, I panicked.

823
00:50:01,637 --> 00:50:04,547
TRAVIS: You did panic.

824
00:50:04,547 --> 00:50:07,891
SAM: You know why they call me Obby the Rat?

825
00:50:07,891 --> 00:50:09,509
TRAVIS: Why?

826
00:50:09,509 --> 00:50:11,562
SAM: Rats survive.

827
00:50:11,562 --> 00:50:14,676
ASHLY: Who hugs Obby when Obby needs to be
punished?

828
00:50:14,676 --> 00:50:17,293
TRAVIS: That is a good question.

829
00:50:17,293 --> 00:50:19,087
SAM: We'll never know.

830
00:50:19,087 --> 00:50:20,914
LIAM: The Raven Queen.

831
00:50:20,914 --> 00:50:22,192
MARY: Yes.

832
00:50:22,192 --> 00:50:26,813
TRAVIS: Since you're so eager to make your way
through the hall, would you mind leading the way

833
00:50:26,813 --> 00:50:31,427
for us, at a good 20-foot distance from the rest
of us.

834
00:50:31,427 --> 00:50:36,416
SAM: Obby will oblige.

835
00:50:36,416 --> 00:50:38,684
LIAM: So Obby hobbles ahead, shamefacedly.

836
00:50:38,684 --> 00:50:43,203
LAURA: It might be smart, you guys, to keep
looking for little tiles, because my grandma's

837
00:50:43,203 --> 00:50:44,549
really paranoid.

838
00:50:44,549 --> 00:50:48,555
SAM: I will do a perception check to see if I see
any more tiles.

839
00:50:48,555 --> 00:50:50,698
LIAM: Okay, go for it.

840
00:50:50,698 --> 00:50:51,736
SAM: Five.

841
00:50:51,736 --> 00:50:54,746
LIAM: Five. Well there's lots of tiles, there's
tiles from here all over.

842
00:50:54,746 --> 00:50:58,180
TRAVIS: As he goes off, I will also check the
grounds around him.

843
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,470
LIAM: Great.

844
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:02,508
TRAVIS: 14.

845
00:51:02,508 --> 00:51:04,777
LAURA: Better than five!

846
00:51:04,777 --> 00:51:09,638
LIAM: You're scanning the ceiling really hard now
for little holes, and you're looking for any of

847
00:51:09,638 --> 00:51:15,278
these tiles on the floor, any marble tiles that
look askew at all. You don't see anything. You do,

848
00:51:15,278 --> 00:51:20,524
though, as you're walking, looking down, notice
the little leather pack with the three healing

849
00:51:20,524 --> 00:51:25,743
potions that you guys were allotted when you left,
and go oh, good to know that's there. You've got

850
00:51:25,743 --> 00:51:31,801
it. Don't need to use it now, but you have it.
Eventually, you guys all make it to the end of

851
00:51:31,801 --> 00:51:37,202
this tunnel, and Obby, you're the first one there,
you notice the same-- no, you don't know what it

852
00:51:37,202 --> 00:51:45,582
is, you point this out to you, Tarvis. Same little
circular shrew symbol, about three feet off the

853
00:51:45,582 --> 00:51:47,912
ground, in a heavy wooden door.

854
00:51:47,912 --> 00:51:52,508
TRAVIS: You know, Obby, before they get here, it
was opened earlier by Devan cutting her hand

855
00:51:52,508 --> 00:51:53,981
really really deeply.

856
00:51:53,981 --> 00:51:55,179
SAM: I cut my hand.

857
00:51:55,179 --> 00:51:57,149
LIAM: Okay. Going to do anything with it?

858
00:51:57,149 --> 00:51:59,000
SAM: I cut my hand and put it there.

859
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:08,307
LIAM: Okay. Your hand slowly dribbles out on the
door. You feel a little dizzy. Hungry.

860
00:52:08,307 --> 00:52:11,432
TRAVIS: I meant to tell you, she cut it a couple
times.

861
00:52:11,432 --> 00:52:16,870
LIAM: The others catch up with you. You see the
dwarf shoving his hand on it, and you know that's

862
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:18,198
not going to work.

863
00:52:18,198 --> 00:52:21,767
LAURA: Oh, Obby, that only works with people that
are related to her.

864
00:52:21,767 --> 00:52:24,581
SAM: I have a vast lineage.

865
00:52:24,581 --> 00:52:27,277
LAURA: Well then keep trying!

866
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:29,343
SAM: Does it work?

867
00:52:29,343 --> 00:52:33,658
LIAM: No, but you could keep trying all day, maybe
it'll collect.

868
00:52:33,658 --> 00:52:35,546
MARY: Try cutting the other hand.

869
00:52:35,546 --> 00:52:36,854
SAM: No.

870
00:52:36,854 --> 00:52:40,281
LAURA: I loosen up the cut that I already dug in.

871
00:52:40,281 --> 00:52:42,801
LIAM: Yeah, that's all you need to do is get your
hand open.

872
00:52:42,801 --> 00:52:44,154
LAURA: Ow.

873
00:52:44,154 --> 00:52:48,565
LIAM: 30 seconds. And the way that it works, it
takes your grandma something like five or six

874
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:54,082
hours to set one of these, or make one of these.
It takes your grandma about three seconds. You

875
00:52:54,082 --> 00:52:58,652
watched her do it. You've never done this, you've
just watched her do it. She cuts it and it's open.

876
00:52:58,652 --> 00:53:01,353
It's taking longer for you. It's taking like 20 or
30 seconds.

877
00:53:01,353 --> 00:53:03,058
LAURA: Shit. It might not work.

878
00:53:03,058 --> 00:53:06,126
LIAM: You're a weak-ass punk, is the thing. But
eventually (clicking).

879
00:53:06,126 --> 00:53:07,621
LAURA: Hey! See?

880
00:53:07,621 --> 00:53:11,581
TRAVIS: Nicely done. Very useful.

881
00:53:11,581 --> 00:53:13,084
LAURA: Here to help!

882
00:53:13,084 --> 00:53:17,995
ASHLY: So should we go in?

883
00:53:17,995 --> 00:53:20,134
MARY: Does the door open?

884
00:53:20,134 --> 00:53:21,664
LIAM: You open it?

885
00:53:21,664 --> 00:53:23,447
SAM: I will try.

886
00:53:23,447 --> 00:53:27,029
MARY: I'll cast Mage Hand again and push against
it.

887
00:53:27,029 --> 00:53:32,956
LIAM: This spectral, purple, transparent hand
pushes against the door, and it goes (creak), and

888
00:53:32,956 --> 00:53:45,449
soft, warm light spills from over on the right.
You're looking in at some sort of cool, dry

889
00:53:45,449 --> 00:53:50,354
cellar. It's not that bright in here, but the
light that's coming from off to the side here lets

890
00:53:50,354 --> 00:53:55,889
you see that there are shelves lining all the
walls. You see a lot of wooden boxes stacked next

891
00:53:55,889 --> 00:54:00,721
to each other, something like 20 of them against
the wall, and in the middle of the room, which you

892
00:54:00,721 --> 00:54:06,521
can see mostly from where you're standing, are
three pallets in a row of similar wooden crates,

893
00:54:06,521 --> 00:54:11,260
but the ones on the pallets are wedged together
very tightly, very orderly, all in a row for

894
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:13,478
storage of some kind.

895
00:54:13,478 --> 00:54:19,489
MARY: Well, looks like we've got a storage room,
I'm not sure if it's wine, there's boxes along the

896
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:23,449
wall, and there's three in the center. But they're
rather purposefully--

897
00:54:23,449 --> 00:54:27,258
TRAVIS: Does this look familiar to you at all?

898
00:54:27,258 --> 00:54:28,507
LIAM: No, it does not.

899
00:54:28,507 --> 00:54:33,996
LAURA: No, it doesn't. I don't think I've ever
been down in this room before, but we've got to be

900
00:54:33,996 --> 00:54:35,913
close to the basement!

901
00:54:35,913 --> 00:54:37,950
TRAVIS: Are we looking for the basement?

902
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:39,807
LAURA: Well that's where she keeps a lot of her
treasure.

903
00:54:39,807 --> 00:54:41,354
TRAVIS: In the basement?

904
00:54:41,354 --> 00:54:43,848
LAURA: Yeah.

905
00:54:43,848 --> 00:54:45,342
TRAVIS: Can I insight check Devan?

906
00:54:45,342 --> 00:54:46,517
LIAM: Sure.

907
00:54:46,517 --> 00:54:47,909
TRAVIS: 12?

908
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:53,733
LIAM: Oh man, this is one of those instances where
I'm going to homebrew it, because I don't know

909
00:54:53,733 --> 00:54:55,371
what the rule is.

910
00:54:55,371 --> 00:54:57,546
LAURA: Do I roll against it?

911
00:54:57,546 --> 00:54:59,274
LIAM: Yeah, sure you do.

912
00:54:59,274 --> 00:55:04,198
MARY: That's it. Yeah, no chat room so it doesn't
matter!

913
00:55:04,198 --> 00:55:06,528
LIAM: Also, don't tweet me because I don't care.

914
00:55:06,528 --> 00:55:10,529
LAURA: I rolled a six!

915
00:55:10,529 --> 00:55:16,977
LIAM: A six, okay. She seems nervous as fuck, but
she's not artfully carrying off any lie that you

916
00:55:16,977 --> 00:55:18,436
can tell.

917
00:55:18,436 --> 00:55:20,334
TRAVIS: She's nervous because Obby is so
attractive.

918
00:55:20,334 --> 00:55:22,659
LIAM: I'm nervous because Obby is so attractive.

919
00:55:22,659 --> 00:55:26,281
SAM: I'm squeezing the number one out of my
moustache.

920
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:28,821
LAURA: Ew. So foul!

921
00:55:28,821 --> 00:55:37,774
TRAVIS: The Clasp, we like to do things quietly.
If we hear any rumblings of trouble, hide. Fair

922
00:55:37,774 --> 00:55:38,830
enough?

923
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:39,887
LAURA: Yeah!

924
00:55:39,887 --> 00:55:40,843
TRAVIS: Good.

925
00:55:40,843 --> 00:55:45,065
LAURA: Believe me, if anything starts happening
here, you should hide, because her magic is really

926
00:55:45,065 --> 00:55:46,275
powerful.

927
00:55:46,275 --> 00:55:49,556
TRAVIS: What's your relationship with her, by the
way? Good terms, bad terms?

928
00:55:49,556 --> 00:55:50,974
LAURA: Terrible.

929
00:55:50,974 --> 00:55:52,067
TRAVIS: Really?

930
00:55:52,067 --> 00:55:54,686
SAM: What did you do? Was it a boy?

931
00:55:54,686 --> 00:55:57,314
LAURA: So you know, this thing-- have you heard of
gambling?

932
00:55:57,314 --> 00:55:59,506
ASHLY: Oh, I know gambling!

933
00:55:59,506 --> 00:56:00,814
LAURA: Yeah, it's really fun, right?

934
00:56:00,814 --> 00:56:01,918
ASHLY: Yeah!

935
00:56:01,918 --> 00:56:03,097
TRAVIS: Dren, Dren.

936
00:56:03,097 --> 00:56:04,862
ASHLY: Oh yeah, sorry.

937
00:56:04,862 --> 00:56:11,112
LAURA: So I took some of her money to do that.
That's all.

938
00:56:11,112 --> 00:56:12,688
MARY: How much?

939
00:56:12,688 --> 00:56:19,086
LAURA: I don't know! She has a big room of gold, I
just took some of it. I really don't know.

940
00:56:19,086 --> 00:56:21,488
ASHLY: Could we take some gold too?

941
00:56:21,488 --> 00:56:25,577
LAURA: That's what I mean! But she might keep the
emerald down there.

942
00:56:25,577 --> 00:56:26,904
MARY: Do you remember which room that was?

943
00:56:26,904 --> 00:56:28,509
LAURA: Yeah, it's in the basement.

944
00:56:28,509 --> 00:56:30,048
MARY: The room of gold is in the basement?

945
00:56:30,048 --> 00:56:31,266
LAURA: Uh-huh!

946
00:56:31,266 --> 00:56:32,183
MARY: All right.

947
00:56:32,183 --> 00:56:33,361
TRAVIS: You have pockets?

948
00:56:33,361 --> 00:56:34,398
ASHLY: Yeah.

949
00:56:34,398 --> 00:56:36,524
TRAVIS: If we find a room of gold, you can fill
your pockets.

950
00:56:36,524 --> 00:56:37,932
ASHLY: Thanks, Tarvis.

951
00:56:37,932 --> 00:56:38,901
TRAVIS: No worries.

952
00:56:38,901 --> 00:56:40,758
MARY: Can I check for traps in this room as we
enter?

953
00:56:40,758 --> 00:56:41,805
LIAM: You're entering?

954
00:56:41,805 --> 00:56:42,826
MARY: Yeah.

955
00:56:42,826 --> 00:56:46,307
LIAM: Okay, as you step in, you see where the
light is coming from. There is a small, little

956
00:56:46,307 --> 00:56:52,301
writing desk in the corner, and there's a little
globe, very similar to your dancing lights,

957
00:56:52,301 --> 00:56:57,668
floating above the desk. The desk is too small for
the bigger folk in this group, but it's about the

958
00:56:57,668 --> 00:57:01,038
right size for a halfling. Just a couple papers
scattered on it.

959
00:57:01,038 --> 00:57:03,123
LAURA: Ooh! Can I go over and look at them?

960
00:57:03,123 --> 00:57:05,071
MARY: Do you want me to check for traps, first?

961
00:57:05,071 --> 00:57:06,778
LIAM: Yeah, well, whatever you roll.

962
00:57:06,778 --> 00:57:12,931
MARY: 18, perception. So 18, 19, 20, 24!

963
00:57:12,931 --> 00:57:17,688
LIAM: You hold Devan back as she presses forward,
and you eyeball the room for a good 15 seconds.

964
00:57:17,688 --> 00:57:23,921
Check the ceiling. No holes. Look around the room.
Seems okay.

965
00:57:23,921 --> 00:57:25,678
MARY: Dren.

966
00:57:25,678 --> 00:57:26,691
ASHLY: Yes?

967
00:57:26,691 --> 00:57:28,236
MARY: You go check out that table.

968
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:29,400
ASHLY: Sure! Yeah.

969
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:30,763
MARY: You, stay behind me.

970
00:57:30,763 --> 00:57:36,114
ASHLY: Stay behind, prisoner. I go over to the
table. Do I need to make a check or anything, or

971
00:57:36,114 --> 00:57:37,190
can I--?

972
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:40,540
LIAM: You can, or I could just tell you what you
see?

973
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:44,694
ASHLY: Yeah, just tell me what I see. What's
Dungeons &amp; Dragons?

974
00:57:44,694 --> 00:57:48,558
MARY: Where's the dragon? Is this a dungeon?

975
00:57:48,558 --> 00:57:56,052
LIAM: There's a couple of pieces of paper on the
desk. There's a letter made out to a cousin about

976
00:57:56,052 --> 00:58:04,143
a wedding. There's another letter about a
disagreement over the price of fabric.

977
00:58:04,143 --> 00:58:07,158
ASHLY: These are boring so far.

978
00:58:07,158 --> 00:58:08,799
MARY: Do you see a log book?

979
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:10,628
ASHLY: Do I see a log book?

980
00:58:10,628 --> 00:58:12,351
LIAM: Just a couple pieces of paper.

981
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:14,177
ASHLY: Is there a drawer in the writing desk at
all?

982
00:58:14,177 --> 00:58:15,173
LIAM: There is.

983
00:58:15,173 --> 00:58:16,129
ASHLY: Can I open it?

984
00:58:16,129 --> 00:58:17,065
LIAM: Sure.

985
00:58:17,065 --> 00:58:17,985
ASHLY: I open it.

986
00:58:17,985 --> 00:58:19,340
MARY: (explosion)

987
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:20,365
LIAM: No.

988
00:58:20,365 --> 00:58:21,561
MARY: Roll for initiative.

989
00:58:21,561 --> 00:58:28,542
LIAM: There are more pieces of paper in there, and
you find bills of sale, and amounts of coin

990
00:58:28,542 --> 00:58:35,525
changing hands. Records of hers. You see the names
of a couple of money lenders listed in Emon, that

991
00:58:35,525 --> 00:58:48,135
you're familiar with. You randomly pull a contract
for surveillance of General Krieg Tristan. That's

992
00:58:48,135 --> 00:58:56,202
a name that raises your eyebrows. Everyone in Emon
knows him. That's it. It's a lot of business

993
00:58:56,202 --> 00:59:01,224
transactions, but you can't really make out what
or who. I mean, not what, you can tell what's

994
00:59:01,224 --> 00:59:05,796
being changed hands for the most part, but who
knows who bought, who knows who sold.

995
00:59:05,796 --> 00:59:09,049
ASHLY: And there's nothing, like, hidden or
tricksy?

996
00:59:09,049 --> 00:59:11,107
LIAM: Make a perception check.

997
00:59:11,107 --> 00:59:14,110
ASHLY: That's not going to work, but here we go!
One!

998
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:15,317
LAURA: Oh no, we're halfling!

999
00:59:15,317 --> 00:59:18,030
ASHLY: Oh hey! Except my perception is zero...
eight!

1000
00:59:18,030 --> 00:59:21,313
TRAVIS: Your perception's zero?

1001
00:59:21,313 --> 00:59:22,515
MARY: Yes!

1002
00:59:22,515 --> 00:59:26,037
LAURA: This is the one that got me killed, so I
don't know if you want to roll that.

1003
00:59:26,037 --> 00:59:28,967
ASHLY: So we're going to replace this guy with a
new one!

1004
00:59:28,967 --> 00:59:34,560
TRAVIS: There is no one more jinxy than Laura. No
one more superstitious.

1005
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:36,737
ASHLY: Ooh! This is the pretty one. I'll use this
one.

1006
00:59:36,737 --> 00:59:37,792
LAURA: Yeah!

1007
00:59:37,792 --> 00:59:39,209
SAM: Oh, that got someone else killed.

1008
00:59:39,209 --> 00:59:40,476
LAURA: No, no, it didn't.

1009
00:59:40,476 --> 00:59:42,758
TRAVIS: She runs up her dice more than a
professional athlete, it's crazy.

1010
00:59:42,758 --> 00:59:47,741
LIAM: Tarvis, you also notice there's a couple
pieces of paper also lying helter-skelter on top

1011
00:59:47,741 --> 00:59:51,551
of the pallets as well. There's papers all over
this room.

1012
00:59:51,551 --> 00:59:53,657
ASHLY: I collect all of it and I bring it to
Tarvis.

1013
00:59:53,657 --> 00:59:57,676
TRAVIS: Are there any records, or binders,
ledgers, things like that?

1014
00:59:57,676 --> 01:00:04,805
LIAM: No, you crack the lid off one of these
boxes, and it is full of paper, and you pull it

1015
01:00:04,805 --> 01:00:10,344
out. You take a couple of minutes to look through
this stuff. What's weird is that, again, it is all

1016
01:00:10,344 --> 01:00:16,372
about amounts of money being moved around, and
bills of sale, but there's no names, but there's

1017
01:00:16,372 --> 01:00:21,736
weird words that pop up over and over again, like
you see the word "shortstack" like seven times.

1018
01:00:21,736 --> 01:00:29,941
"Whisperer" appears several times. You see on a
bill of sales Adelaide's signature, and then next

1019
01:00:29,941 --> 01:00:35,213
to it is the word "overbite," but you don't know
what it means. But it seems to have some sort of

1020
01:00:35,213 --> 01:00:36,718
pattern.

1021
01:00:36,718 --> 01:00:38,799
ASHLY: Does it make any sense to you, Tarvis?

1022
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:45,482
TRAVIS: Not sure yet. Do I recognize any code or a
cipher in the writing?

1023
01:00:45,482 --> 01:00:48,621
LIAM: Make a straight-up intelligence check.

1024
01:00:48,621 --> 01:00:50,591
LAURA: Natural 20.

1025
01:00:50,591 --> 01:00:54,090
TRAVIS: Nine.

1026
01:00:54,090 --> 01:00:56,176
MARY: 11.

1027
01:00:56,176 --> 01:01:02,543
LIAM: It's like carpets being sold, some weapons
being sold. A loan.

1028
01:01:02,543 --> 01:01:04,727
TRAVIS: Okay.

1029
01:01:04,727 --> 01:01:08,573
MARY: Can I investigate the boxes on the wall?

1030
01:01:08,573 --> 01:01:11,074
LIAM: Sure. Make an investigation check.

1031
01:01:11,074 --> 01:01:18,525
LAURA: Ooh, are we doing this? I want to
investigate them too!

1032
01:01:18,525 --> 01:01:19,759
MARY: Eight.

1033
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:21,203
LIAM: Oh, go for it.

1034
01:01:21,203 --> 01:01:22,624
TRAVIS: Dren, stay with her.

1035
01:01:22,624 --> 01:01:25,263
SAM: I'm going to look for exits and entrances to
the room.

1036
01:01:25,263 --> 01:01:26,694
LIAM: Yeah, you see a door.

1037
01:01:26,694 --> 01:01:30,240
LAURA: Seven! We suck.

1038
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:37,746
LIAM: The walls are really shitty down here, and
not smoothed out or pretty. It's a rough room. But

1039
01:01:37,746 --> 01:01:39,616
there is a door straight across from where you
entered.

1040
01:01:39,616 --> 01:01:41,017
SAM: There's another? Not the one we came in.

1041
01:01:41,017 --> 01:01:42,274
LIAM: Yes. Another door.

1042
01:01:42,274 --> 01:01:46,254
MARY: So we did an eight and a seven on
perception, investigating those boxes.

1043
01:01:46,254 --> 01:01:50,349
LIAM: There's a lot of really boring paperwork
here, listing a lot of sales. Though you did find

1044
01:01:50,349 --> 01:01:57,418
a piece of paper that describes the sale of a
wyrmling dragon. That's cool.

1045
01:01:57,418 --> 01:01:58,807
LAURA: That's pretty cool.

1046
01:01:58,807 --> 01:02:00,254
ASHLY: I like dragons.

1047
01:02:00,254 --> 01:02:05,151
SAM: I found a piece of paper with codes on it,
like Maverick, Goose, Hollywood.

1048
01:02:05,151 --> 01:02:06,432
TRAVIS: Wolfman?

1049
01:02:06,432 --> 01:02:08,016
SAM: I can't make it out.

1050
01:02:08,016 --> 01:02:09,118
TRAVIS: Slider?

1051
01:02:09,118 --> 01:02:10,511
LIAM: That is true.

1052
01:02:10,511 --> 01:02:12,345
TRAVIS: Sundown?

1053
01:02:12,345 --> 01:02:14,618
MARY: Do you feel the need for anything?

1054
01:02:14,618 --> 01:02:17,438
LAURA: I start heading towards the exit of the
room.

1055
01:02:17,438 --> 01:02:19,204
MARY: Excuse me, dear.

1056
01:02:19,204 --> 01:02:23,728
ASHLY: Oh, excuse me, you can't go by yourself!
I'm in charge of you, get behind me.

1057
01:02:23,728 --> 01:02:24,970
LAURA: Sure.

1058
01:02:24,970 --> 01:02:26,446
ASHLY: Sorry, guys, she--

1059
01:02:26,446 --> 01:02:28,716
MARY: I do have rope if she gets out of hand, we
could--

1060
01:02:28,716 --> 01:02:29,872
ASHLY: We'll need it!

1061
01:02:29,872 --> 01:02:31,439
LAURA: Just make sure I can still use my hands.

1062
01:02:31,439 --> 01:02:35,525
MARY: Well, we could put it around your neck.

1063
01:02:35,525 --> 01:02:38,614
ASHLY: That means we'll kill you. If you get out
of line.

1064
01:02:38,614 --> 01:02:41,084
MARY: Would just make it easier.

1065
01:02:41,169 --> 01:02:45,183
ASHLY: She's funny. Should we go to the next
room?

1066
01:02:45,271 --> 01:02:48,142
TRAVIS: We will go to the door, and we will see if
it's locked.

1067
01:02:48,142 --> 01:02:50,081
LIAM: Okay, you grab it?

1068
01:02:50,276 --> 01:02:51,192
TRAVIS: No.

1069
01:02:51,192 --> 01:02:52,420
MARY: Obby.

1070
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:53,958
TRAVIS: Obby just grabs it.

1071
01:02:53,958 --> 01:02:57,173
SAM: Obby the Rat can break any lock.

1072
01:02:57,173 --> 01:02:58,690
MARY: This I have heard.

1073
01:02:58,690 --> 01:03:00,216
SAM: I will check the doorknob.

1074
01:03:00,216 --> 01:03:01,926
LIAM: Okay, so you rattle it?

1075
01:03:01,926 --> 01:03:02,828
SAM: Yeah.

1076
01:03:02,828 --> 01:03:07,093
LIAM: Yeah, checking for traps? All right, make a
perception check.

1077
01:03:07,093 --> 01:03:08,828
SAM: Two.

1078
01:03:08,828 --> 01:03:10,971
LIAM: This shit is clear. You are golden.

1079
01:03:10,971 --> 01:03:12,985
SAM: We're good. I open the door.

1080
01:03:12,985 --> 01:03:19,425
LIAM: Okay. It's wide open. There's a set of
stairs that winds away and goes up.

1081
01:03:19,425 --> 01:03:22,151
TRAVIS: Is it lit by light or torch?

1082
01:03:22,151 --> 01:03:25,537
LIAM: Just from the light that's spilling out of the
room you're in. So it's dim, but you can see fine.

1083
01:03:25,537 --> 01:03:27,094
TRAVIS: Just leads to a stairway?

1084
01:03:27,094 --> 01:03:28,041
LIAM: Yeah.

1085
01:03:28,041 --> 01:03:29,196
TRAVIS: Wood? Brick?

1086
01:03:29,196 --> 01:03:30,205
LIAM: Wood.

1087
01:03:30,205 --> 01:03:41,254
TRAVIS: Do we hear anything up the stairs? Dren,
you're up. Be as tiny as you can be, and sneak up

1088
01:03:41,254 --> 01:03:43,164
those stairs and see what you can see.

1089
01:03:43,164 --> 01:03:50,985
ASHLY: Yes sir. Stealth check? Sweet. Goddamn it.
12.

1090
01:03:50,985 --> 01:03:52,079
LIAM: 12, okay.

1091
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:56,773
ASHLY: Oh, you're cursing all of them, Laura!

1092
01:03:56,773 --> 01:04:03,352
LIAM: Sneaky little halfling skitters up the
stairs. There's another door at the top.

1093
01:04:03,352 --> 01:04:09,469
ASHLY: Guys, there's an-- oh, thank you. I don't
know how to say this stealthed.

1094
01:04:09,469 --> 01:04:15,582
LIAM: Yeah, they're down around a curve, so you're
doing that to no one.

1095
01:04:15,582 --> 01:04:17,260
TRAVIS: There's a fox bat flying?

1096
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:19,245
ASHLY: I crawl over, and I go.

1097
01:04:19,245 --> 01:04:23,071
TRAVIS: All right. I motion for everyone to go up
the stairs.

1098
01:04:23,071 --> 01:04:30,447
MARY: I follow in the rear with my rapier. I pull
out a dagger as well.

1099
01:04:30,447 --> 01:04:36,229
LIAM: Poke, poke, poke, poke. Okay, everyone files
up the stairs.

1100
01:04:36,229 --> 01:04:39,495
ASHLY: Wait, I just realized we're trying to go to
the basement, but we're going up.

1101
01:04:39,495 --> 01:04:41,177
LAURA: Why are we going-- sure.

1102
01:04:41,177 --> 01:04:44,134
LIAM: They're going up. And there's a door
standing in front of you.

1103
01:04:44,134 --> 01:04:45,612
SAM: We had nowhere else to go.

1104
01:04:45,612 --> 01:04:47,004
TRAVIS: Wait a minute.

1105
01:04:47,004 --> 01:04:49,470
MARY: Yeah. Was that the only door to get out of
that room?

1106
01:04:49,470 --> 01:04:50,892
LIAM: Yeah.

1107
01:04:50,892 --> 01:04:53,024
TRAVIS: Did we check for hidden doors or
passages?

1108
01:04:53,024 --> 01:04:54,081
SAM and MARY: No.

1109
01:04:54,081 --> 01:04:55,459
LIAM: Well you checked for traps.

1110
01:04:55,459 --> 01:04:56,362
MARY: I did.

1111
01:04:56,362 --> 01:04:57,282
LIAM: You didn't see any doors.

1112
01:04:57,282 --> 01:05:02,288
MARY: There's nothing behind any of those boxes or
anything or under the pallets in the center of the room?

1113
01:05:02,288 --> 01:05:03,907
LIAM: I don't know.

1114
01:05:03,907 --> 01:05:13,600
MARY: All right. Wait. Before we go, hold on, come
back. Tarvis, get with me and let's push these

1115
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:15,152
pallets in the middle of the room.

1116
01:05:15,152 --> 01:05:16,634
TRAVIS: Yeah. There's three of them.

1117
01:05:16,634 --> 01:05:19,350
MARY: There's three of them. They're probably very
heavy.

1118
01:05:19,350 --> 01:05:22,811
TRAVIS: Let's take the one on the left. And we'll
push it.

1119
01:05:22,811 --> 01:05:26,998
LIAM: (sliding) Nothing.

1120
01:05:26,998 --> 01:05:28,530
MARY: Center.

1121
01:05:28,530 --> 01:05:34,058
LIAM: (sliding) A dead rat breaks open and smears
on the floor--

1122
01:05:34,058 --> 01:05:35,504
MARY: Obby, your cousin.

1123
01:05:35,504 --> 01:05:38,071
(laughter)

1124
01:05:38,071 --> 01:05:39,647
SAM: Not related.

1125
01:05:39,647 --> 01:05:40,807
TRAVIS: The one on the right.

1126
01:05:40,807 --> 01:05:42,509
ASHLY: I thought you had a vast lineage.

1127
01:05:42,509 --> 01:05:44,269
SAM: That one I know particularly.

1128
01:05:44,269 --> 01:05:47,231
LIAM: There is nothing under these pallets.

1129
01:05:47,231 --> 01:05:49,543
MARY: Can I check behind the boxes on the wall?

1130
01:05:49,543 --> 01:05:56,538
LIAM: Yes, you may. So in the interest of time,
you spend three or four minutes, push push push,

1131
01:05:56,538 --> 01:06:01,201
lots of paper. Nothing you find that's hidden.

1132
01:06:01,201 --> 01:06:04,800
TRAVIS: There was nothing on the desk? No switches,
no--

1133
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:10,328
LAURA: This is a storage room! The rest of her
stuff is in the house!

1134
01:06:10,328 --> 01:06:11,924
TRAVIS: I thought you've never been in this room.

1135
01:06:11,924 --> 01:06:13,977
MARY: But you said it was in the dungeon, or the
basement.

1136
01:06:13,977 --> 01:06:16,761
LAURA: Yeah, this is not the basement! This is a
storage room!

1137
01:06:16,761 --> 01:06:21,009
TRAVIS: All right, as we go back up towards the
stairs, can we check the walls for any secrets?

1138
01:06:21,009 --> 01:06:23,202
LIAM: In the room or in the stairway?

1139
01:06:23,202 --> 01:06:24,204
TRAVIS: Up the stairway.

1140
01:06:24,204 --> 01:06:25,267
LIAM: Yeah, sure.

1141
01:06:25,267 --> 01:06:28,535
TRAVIS: 22.

1142
01:06:28,535 --> 01:06:33,353
LIAM: You two are the big ballers with perception.
Yeah, it's a well-made staircase.

1143
01:06:33,353 --> 01:06:36,084
TRAVIS: Great, Dren, will you check that door at
the top of the stairs for traps?

1144
01:06:36,084 --> 01:06:39,386
ASHLY: Yes, boss. I go and I try the door.

1145
01:06:39,386 --> 01:06:41,185
LIAM: Oh, you just open it?

1146
01:06:41,185 --> 01:06:45,493
ASHLY: Oh, my perception's shit. Should I just do
it? Okay I'll do it. Seven.

1147
01:06:45,493 --> 01:06:49,049
LIAM: Seven, okay. Yeah. It's good.

1148
01:06:49,049 --> 01:06:50,588
ASHLY: Cool, I open it.

1149
01:06:50,709 --> 01:06:52,706
LIAM: Okay, it goes (creaking) and opens.

1150
01:06:52,706 --> 01:06:54,119
ASHLY: That's a good door noise.

1151
01:06:54,119 --> 01:06:55,658
MARY and SAM: Or a cat?

1152
01:06:55,658 --> 01:06:57,602
LAURA and TRAVIS: (meowing)

1153
01:06:57,602 --> 01:07:00,857
LIAM: You see not much. You still have your lights
going?

1154
01:07:00,857 --> 01:07:02,336
LAURA: Yes.

1155
01:07:02,336 --> 01:07:07,628
LIAM: Yeah, okay. There's light flickering from
behind the group all the way near the back. And so

1156
01:07:07,628 --> 01:07:13,964
you're seeing shadows and light flicker in this
room. And in this room, you can't see the whole

1157
01:07:13,964 --> 01:07:22,663
room yet, but you see glimpses of rows of chests.
Thick, wooden chests. Solid. Locks on some of

1158
01:07:22,663 --> 01:07:29,462
them, not all of them, but neatly done in little
aisles. Each one about two feet tall. Big, thick

1159
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:36,337
bastards. You recognize this room, peering
through. This is where you used to skim from

1160
01:07:36,337 --> 01:07:43,936
grandma's stores. Although you're a little
confused because there's only one door to this room.

1161
01:07:43,936 --> 01:07:47,503
SAM: Wait. This is the only door in?

1162
01:07:47,503 --> 01:07:49,509
MARY: The door that we just came through is the
only door?

1163
01:07:49,509 --> 01:07:52,098
LIAM: You're disoriented. This is not how you're
used to entering it.

1164
01:07:52,098 --> 01:07:56,586
LAURA: Right, I came in from the other way.
Where's the other way?

1165
01:07:56,586 --> 01:07:57,929
MARY: What other way?

1166
01:07:57,929 --> 01:07:59,643
TRAVIS: You recognize this room?

1167
01:07:59,643 --> 01:08:01,942
LAURA: Well yeah! This is the basement.

1168
01:08:01,942 --> 01:08:06,021
TRAVIS: Excellent. Delweth, Dren, go with her and
explore.

1169
01:08:06,021 --> 01:08:08,414
MARY: All right. I check for traps.

1170
01:08:08,414 --> 01:08:10,682
LIAM: Okay, make a perception check.

1171
01:08:10,682 --> 01:08:17,846
MARY: 12. No! Yes. 12.

1172
01:08:17,846 --> 01:08:23,362
LIAM: Okay, Devan's globes of light are floating
lazily around the room, close to you. And again

1173
01:08:23,362 --> 01:08:29,241
the shadows are shifting, moving slowly. But you
have enough light to see. You walk along one of

1174
01:08:29,241 --> 01:08:34,048
the aisles and look around. You don't see
anything. Nothing in the ceiling, nothing in the

1175
01:08:34,048 --> 01:08:37,419
floor. The chests look normal.

1176
01:08:37,419 --> 01:08:40,800
ASHLY: Devan, do you know what's in any of these?

1177
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:41,956
LAURA: Gold!

1178
01:08:41,956 --> 01:08:43,052
ASHLY: It's just gold!?

1179
01:08:43,052 --> 01:08:44,105
LAURA: I think so!

1180
01:08:44,105 --> 01:08:45,254
ASHLY: I open the nearest chest.

1181
01:08:45,254 --> 01:08:46,234
LIAM: You open the nearest chest?

1182
01:08:46,234 --> 01:08:47,113
ASHLY: Yeah!

1183
01:08:47,113 --> 01:08:53,544
LIAM: You open it up. There is a fuck-ton of gold
coin in this chest beyond counting.

1184
01:08:53,544 --> 01:08:57,106
SAM: Okay, I go to them and say: do not touch that
gold.

1185
01:08:57,106 --> 01:08:58,939
ASHLY: Tarvis said I could!

1186
01:08:58,939 --> 01:09:06,795
SAM: No, I'm going to check it for traps. What am
I doing, perception? Ten.

1187
01:09:06,795 --> 01:09:13,218
LIAM: Yes, there's no trap on the chest that she
just opened. Seems okay.

1188
01:09:13,218 --> 01:09:17,289
SAM: Okay, Dren, you can stick your hand in and
get--

1189
01:09:17,289 --> 01:09:18,507
TRAVIS: Wait.

1190
01:09:18,507 --> 01:09:23,077
MARY: Oh, such a bad idea. Stick a knife in or
something first so it's not your hand.

1191
01:09:23,077 --> 01:09:24,737
TRAVIS: Who can check for magic?

1192
01:09:24,737 --> 01:09:29,462
ASHLY: What's the difference between perception
and investigation?

1193
01:09:29,462 --> 01:09:33,371
LIAM: Perception is seeing and spotting things,
hearing things. Investigation is looking at stuff

1194
01:09:33,371 --> 01:09:36,698
left behind and going how does that connect to
that?

1195
01:09:36,698 --> 01:09:42,440
LAURA: Do you want me to grab some gold to show
you it's fine? We're not here for the gold, but

1196
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:44,163
sure. And I pick up some gold.

1197
01:09:44,163 --> 01:09:45,737
LIAM: Okay.

1198
01:09:45,737 --> 01:09:52,281
TRAVIS: Yeah, that was bad. It's not on alarm.

1199
01:09:52,281 --> 01:09:57,372
SAM: A dragon appears.

1200
01:09:57,372 --> 01:09:59,736
ASHLY: Oh, that's why it's called Dungeons &amp;
Dragons!

1201
01:09:59,736 --> 01:10:03,771
LIAM: But as you dig your hand into this gold and
pull and up and coins fall away, you notice out of

1202
01:10:03,771 --> 01:10:12,082
the corner of your eye, the chest next to it
swell, bulge, open, and a mouth bigger than you've

1203
01:10:12,082 --> 01:10:15,270
ever seen (horrible screeching noise).

1204
01:10:15,270 --> 01:10:18,214
LAURA: I knew there were more than before!

1205
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:21,875
LIAM: Lunges to bite you. And does, in fact, get
you.

1206
01:10:21,875 --> 01:10:26,724
LAURA: Oh no! Can't I dodge out of the way? Can't I
dodge out of the way?

1207
01:10:26,724 --> 01:10:28,550
LIAM: Everybody roll for initiative.

1208
01:10:28,550 --> 01:10:30,056
LAURA: Ah shit.

1209
01:10:30,056 --> 01:10:31,313
ASHLY: 16.

1210
01:10:31,313 --> 01:10:34,601
LIAM: Okay, hold on.

1211
01:10:34,601 --> 01:10:35,894
SAM: Oh boy.

1212
01:10:35,894 --> 01:10:37,935
LAURA: Oh no! Oh no!

1213
01:10:37,935 --> 01:10:40,117
ASHLY: You reroll it!

1214
01:10:40,117 --> 01:10:42,275
LAURA: Oh my gosh, I don't even want to roll that
one again.

1215
01:10:42,275 --> 01:10:48,917
ASHLY: That was so close! Oh my god!

1216
01:10:48,917 --> 01:10:50,745
LAURA: That was so close!

1217
01:10:50,745 --> 01:10:53,331
TRAVIS: Here we go! We got a map!

1218
01:10:53,331 --> 01:10:55,003
LIAM: We have a map!

1219
01:10:55,003 --> 01:10:57,237
MARY: What! It's the first map!

1220
01:10:57,237 --> 01:10:59,378
(cheering)

1221
01:10:59,378 --> 01:11:04,199
SAM: Liam, it's not in 3D, it's not color-coded.

1222
01:11:04,199 --> 01:11:05,844
TRAVIS: Where are the fucking trees?

1223
01:11:05,844 --> 01:11:08,019
SAM: There's no atmospheric mist, come on, man.

1224
01:11:08,019 --> 01:11:11,579
MARY: You didn't find twelve mini chests to put up
there? I mean, come on.

1225
01:11:11,579 --> 01:11:15,985
LIAM: Okay so, this big, massive chest opens its
mouth and you see one big, fat eyeball in the back

1226
01:11:15,985 --> 01:11:24,390
of its misshapen mouth. (growls) And it clamps
down on your hand full of gold, and you take eight points--

1227
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:26,456
LAURA: Oh god! That's a lot!

1228
01:11:26,456 --> 01:11:35,090
LIAM: Did I get it right? Yes. Eight points of
piercing damage. And then also you take one point

1229
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:42,279
of acid damage as its slobber drizzles all over
your arm and it latches down. And you feel what

1230
01:11:42,279 --> 01:11:49,831
feels like crazy glue seep all around your arm and
you yank. "Oh shit," you think. Okay, everybody

1231
01:11:49,831 --> 01:11:51,995
give me your initiatives please.

1232
01:11:51,995 --> 01:11:53,239
SAM: 22.

1233
01:11:53,239 --> 01:11:54,642
LAURA: 20.

1234
01:11:54,642 --> 01:11:56,597
ASHLY: 16 for Dren.

1235
01:11:56,597 --> 01:11:58,968
MARY: 19 for Delweth.

1236
01:11:58,968 --> 01:12:02,605
TRAVIS: Nine for Tarvis.

1237
01:12:02,605 --> 01:12:13,883
LIAM: Nine. Okay. And big man struck out at bat.
Okay, Obby the Rat, you are up.

1238
01:12:13,883 --> 01:12:25,540
SAM: I stealthily flank it using Devan as a
distraction and I will sneak attack it with a

1239
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:26,910
dagger.

1240
01:12:26,910 --> 01:12:29,146
LIAM: Okay, you're coming around the side, you're
saying? Over here?

1241
01:12:29,146 --> 01:12:30,551
SAM: Wait, which one is it?

1242
01:12:30,551 --> 01:12:32,185
LIAM: This is you, this is it right here.

1243
01:12:32,185 --> 01:12:36,383
SAM: Yeah, I'll go straight from where I am.

1244
01:12:36,383 --> 01:12:37,786
LIAM: Straight at it?

1245
01:12:37,786 --> 01:12:39,187
SAM: Yeah, from the side.

1246
01:12:39,187 --> 01:12:41,818
LIAM: Okay, all right. Roll to attack.

1247
01:12:41,818 --> 01:12:45,092
SAM: Nope. 11.

1248
01:12:45,092 --> 01:12:52,285
LIAM: Okay. You lunge forward with your dagger and
it melts a little out of the way, seeing you

1249
01:12:52,285 --> 01:12:57,318
coming. Devan, you are up, and you are grappled,
you are in this thing's mouth.

1250
01:12:57,318 --> 01:13:02,411
SAM: With my bonus action, I still have some
movement, right?

1251
01:13:02,411 --> 01:13:04,192
LIAM: You have plenty of movement.

1252
01:13:04,192 --> 01:13:10,598
SAM: I will disengage and hop over that chest so
I'm more behind it.

1253
01:13:10,598 --> 01:13:12,860
LIAM: Here?

1254
01:13:12,860 --> 01:13:13,878
SAM: Right there.

1255
01:13:13,878 --> 01:13:15,622
LIAM: Okay. All right, Devan, you're up.

1256
01:13:15,622 --> 01:13:21,838
LAURA: With my hand stuck in it, I set my hands on
fire and cast Burning Hands.

1257
01:13:21,838 --> 01:13:24,620
LIAM: Holy shit! Yes you do.

1258
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:26,819
SAM: Aptly named spell.

1259
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:33,849
LIAM: Okay, 3d6, okay and what's your DC?

1260
01:13:33,849 --> 01:13:35,777
LAURA: That's a good question.

1261
01:13:35,777 --> 01:13:39,905
LIAM: Oh, it's a dex save versus your-- okay.
But there's no dex save because your hand's in its mouth.

1262
01:13:39,905 --> 01:13:41,611
LAURA: Just roll?

1263
01:13:41,611 --> 01:13:43,375
LIAM: Just roll for damage. Roll your 3d6.

1264
01:13:43,375 --> 01:13:50,041
LAURA: Oh come on! Oh wait, can I reroll ones? On
the damage, no.

1265
01:13:50,041 --> 01:13:51,538
LIAM: You do have that--

1266
01:13:51,538 --> 01:13:53,118
LAURA: I don't want to use a sorcery point yet.

1267
01:13:53,118 --> 01:13:54,727
LIAM: Okay, so what'd you get?

1268
01:13:54,727 --> 01:14:00,405
LAURA: Four on 3d6. Two ones and a two. Like the
worst.

1269
01:14:00,405 --> 01:14:05,223
LIAM: Okay, so your hand is stuck in there and out
of rage you feel the fire charge up in your hand

1270
01:14:05,223 --> 01:14:06,925
and you go (fire noise) and it goes (small
explosion noise).

1271
01:14:06,925 --> 01:14:08,500
LAURA: Does it let go of me?

1272
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:09,935
LIAM: Delweth, you're up.

1273
01:14:09,935 --> 01:14:11,047
LAURA: Oh wait! Ugh!

1274
01:14:11,047 --> 01:14:12,352
TRAVIS: You get a bonus action.

1275
01:14:12,352 --> 01:14:13,428
LIAM: You can go.

1276
01:14:13,428 --> 01:14:14,535
ASHLY: You do have a bonus action.

1277
01:14:14,535 --> 01:14:15,514
LIAM: Get it, girl.

1278
01:14:15,514 --> 01:14:17,614
LAURA: I don't know. Ugh.

1279
01:14:17,614 --> 01:14:20,224
TRAVIS: Want to use your bonus action to call for
Dren?

1280
01:14:20,224 --> 01:14:23,643
LAURA: No, I'm good.

1281
01:14:23,643 --> 01:14:25,214
ASHLY: No, we're fine.

1282
01:14:25,214 --> 01:14:30,047
MARY: How many feet away am I from the chest of
death?

1283
01:14:30,047 --> 01:14:31,201
LIAM: 20.

1284
01:14:31,201 --> 01:14:32,184
MARY: 20?

1285
01:14:32,184 --> 01:14:33,424
LAURA: They're on to us.

1286
01:14:33,424 --> 01:14:39,923
MARY: What I want to do is run, take a flying leap
off that first chest.

1287
01:14:39,923 --> 01:14:41,723
LIAM: Okay.

1288
01:14:41,723 --> 01:14:43,087
LAURA: Oh no.

1289
01:14:43,087 --> 01:14:44,216
LIAM: You can do that.

1290
01:14:44,216 --> 01:14:49,364
MARY: And fly up, and do I have enough momentum to
go over the chest that is holding her?

1291
01:14:49,364 --> 01:14:51,580
LIAM: Well, make an acrobatics check.

1292
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:54,779
MARY: I don't know. I'm asking!

1293
01:14:54,779 --> 01:14:56,065
LIAM: Yeah, sure.

1294
01:14:56,065 --> 01:14:59,608
LAURA: Could I have tried to wiggle free? Could I
have tried to break the grapple with my turn? Is

1295
01:14:59,608 --> 01:15:02,273
that possible? Should I have tried to break the
grapple?

1296
01:15:02,273 --> 01:15:03,692
MARY: 24.

1297
01:15:03,692 --> 01:15:09,411
LIAM: 24. (swoosh) You are out of movement. You
don't clear it, but you land on top of the chest

1298
01:15:09,411 --> 01:15:10,798
next to it.

1299
01:15:10,798 --> 01:15:12,948
MARY: I take my rapier and I stab straight down.

1300
01:15:12,948 --> 01:15:14,347
LIAM: All right, roll to attack.

1301
01:15:14,347 --> 01:15:15,923
LAURA: Ah, my hand!

1302
01:15:15,923 --> 01:15:17,801
LIAM: Yeah, don't skewer Devan's hand.

1303
01:15:17,801 --> 01:15:20,996
LAURA: She doesn't care. She wouldn't care if she
did.

1304
01:15:20,996 --> 01:15:25,069
MARY: Three. Six.

1305
01:15:25,069 --> 01:15:33,385
LIAM: Yeah! It goes (growls). Okay, and now we're
on to Dren.

1306
01:15:33,385 --> 01:15:35,128
MARY: Can I bonus action?

1307
01:15:35,128 --> 01:15:36,152
LIAM: Yeah.

1308
01:15:36,152 --> 01:15:38,027
MARY: I'd like to disengage and--

1309
01:15:38,027 --> 01:15:39,250
LIAM: Oh, you're out of movement.

1310
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:40,313
MARY: I'm out of movement.

1311
01:15:40,313 --> 01:15:41,873
LIAM: Yeah, that flip cost you a lot of movement.

1312
01:15:41,873 --> 01:15:45,568
MARY: All right, I'm going to stand tall and proud
on this chest.

1313
01:15:45,568 --> 01:15:50,403
LAURA: Oh, by the way, it's on fire now. It ignites
anything on fire.

1314
01:15:50,403 --> 01:15:51,655
LIAM: Okay, cool.

1315
01:15:51,655 --> 01:15:53,226
ASHLY: I assume I'm not hidden.

1316
01:15:53,226 --> 01:15:54,143
LIAM: No.

1317
01:15:54,143 --> 01:15:55,358
ASHLY: The chest knows where I am.

1318
01:15:55,358 --> 01:15:56,315
LIAM: Yes.

1319
01:15:56,315 --> 01:15:59,370
ASHLY: And I can't move into a position that I am
hidden from him?

1320
01:15:59,370 --> 01:16:01,712
LIAM: You could.

1321
01:16:01,712 --> 01:16:05,074
LAURA: You could dance around the back of him.

1322
01:16:05,074 --> 01:16:09,471
LIAM: But again, since we've got so many rogues,
I'll remind you to get your sneak attack damage

1323
01:16:09,471 --> 01:16:15,578
you don't need to be hidden. If one of your friends
is on it, you get the same from that.

1324
01:16:15,578 --> 01:16:17,349
ASHLY: Oh, so I can do sneak attack right now?

1325
01:16:17,349 --> 01:16:18,669
LIAM: You can do it right now, yeah.

1326
01:16:18,669 --> 01:16:19,896
ASHLY: I'm going to do a sneak attack.

1327
01:16:19,896 --> 01:16:20,895
LIAM: All right, go for it.

1328
01:16:20,895 --> 01:16:24,472
ASHLY: Or can I try to get Devan free? Is there
any way for me to do that?

1329
01:16:24,472 --> 01:16:26,063
LIAM: You can cut her hand off?

1330
01:16:26,063 --> 01:16:28,510
ASHLY: I'll sneak attack.

1331
01:16:28,510 --> 01:16:34,493
LIAM: If you want to try to pry its mouth open or
something you could. Oh, also Delweth, your sword

1332
01:16:34,493 --> 01:16:36,272
sticks, it doesn't come out.

1333
01:16:36,272 --> 01:16:37,583
MARY: Yep.

1334
01:16:37,583 --> 01:16:45,535
ASHLY: I'm going to try to kill this thing with
my shortsword, sneak attack.

1335
01:16:45,535 --> 01:16:47,003
LIAM: Go for it.

1336
01:16:47,003 --> 01:16:48,859
ASHLY: Okay. Can you help me with this?

1337
01:16:48,859 --> 01:16:50,620
LAURA: Yeah totally, you roll. Roll a 20.

1338
01:16:50,620 --> 01:16:52,981
ASHLY: 14.

1339
01:16:52,981 --> 01:16:55,426
LAURA: Oh, that's good! Plus six, so 20 is the
attack.

1340
01:16:55,426 --> 01:16:56,695
LIAM: Okay, that hits.

1341
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:59,262
LAURA: So d6 plus four.

1342
01:16:59,262 --> 01:17:01,454
ASHLY: And then sneak attack, I do an additional
2d6?

1343
01:17:01,454 --> 01:17:04,386
LIAM: Yeah, roll the initial attack first. Do your
damage without it.

1344
01:17:04,386 --> 01:17:06,691
LAURA: Ooh, eight, and then two more d6.

1345
01:17:06,691 --> 01:17:07,914
LIAM: Yep.

1346
01:17:07,914 --> 01:17:09,471
ASHLY: Four and five.

1347
01:17:09,471 --> 01:17:10,463
LAURA: 13.

1348
01:17:10,463 --> 01:17:11,527
LIAM: 13. Nice.

1349
01:17:11,527 --> 01:17:12,488
ASHLY: Sweet.

1350
01:17:12,488 --> 01:17:14,512
SAM: Guys, we're playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons just
like on Stranger Things!

1351
01:17:14,512 --> 01:17:18,544
LAURA: Demogorgon!

1352
01:17:18,544 --> 01:17:24,203
LIAM: So your pint-sized charge here and
the thing is slobbering all over her hand, not

1353
01:17:24,203 --> 01:17:28,627
paying too much attention to you and you're able
to go (stabs) and shove it right under one of its

1354
01:17:28,627 --> 01:17:34,460
teeth that's sticking out and it starts bleeding
down the blade and you go (grunts). Your dagger is

1355
01:17:34,460 --> 01:17:40,866
adhered to the creature, not coming off, your hand
is okay but the dagger is in it. Or what'd you

1356
01:17:40,866 --> 01:17:42,046
say, shortsword?

1357
01:17:42,046 --> 01:17:43,077
ASHLY: Shortsword.

1358
01:17:43,077 --> 01:17:46,078
LIAM: Shortsword is sticking out of this thing and
you cannot get it out, wedging back and forth.

1359
01:17:46,078 --> 01:17:48,209
LAURA: I'll feel real bad if I just fucked
everybody up.

1360
01:17:48,209 --> 01:17:49,222
ASHLY: Okay, I'm going to--

1361
01:17:49,222 --> 01:17:50,289
(Siri beeps)

1362
01:17:50,289 --> 01:17:51,509
LIAM: Hey, Siri.

1363
01:17:51,509 --> 01:17:52,717
SAM: Hey Liam!

1364
01:17:52,717 --> 01:17:53,799
MARY: Hello, Liam!

1365
01:17:53,799 --> 01:17:55,836
TRAVIS: Hello, Grandmaster Flash.

1366
01:17:55,836 --> 01:17:57,132
ASHLY: Disengaging means--

1367
01:17:57,132 --> 01:18:01,069
LIAM: Yeah, you can jump back and it can't get a
free swipe at you.

1368
01:18:01,069 --> 01:18:02,760
ASHLY: Okay, I'll do that. I'll disengage.

1369
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:04,082
LIAM: Okay, where do you want to go?

1370
01:18:04,082 --> 01:18:08,480
ASHLY: I'm going to go on the other side of
Delweth? Can I do that?

1371
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:15,347
LIAM: Here? Delweth, here? Yeah, yes you can.
Boop, and you hop up on a chest, all right. And

1372
01:18:15,347 --> 01:18:16,915
now we're on to you, Tarvis.

1373
01:18:16,915 --> 01:18:18,233
TRAVIS: To me?

1374
01:18:18,233 --> 01:18:19,231
LIAM: Yes.

1375
01:18:19,231 --> 01:18:21,657
TRAVIS: Can I take my scimitar out?

1376
01:18:21,657 --> 01:18:24,780
SAM, MARY, and LAURA: Ooh! Scimitar?

1377
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:29,762
TRAVIS: And the chests that are on the wall
closest to you, those five chests that are there.

1378
01:18:29,762 --> 01:18:31,067
LIAM: Here, yes.

1379
01:18:31,067 --> 01:18:36,703
TRAVIS: Can I move to the one closest to me and
with my scimitar drag it along the face of all

1380
01:18:36,703 --> 01:18:38,662
five of them as I run along them?

1381
01:18:38,662 --> 01:18:40,208
LIAM: Your sword along the face?

1382
01:18:40,208 --> 01:18:41,311
TRAVIS: Yeah, the scimitar.

1383
01:18:41,311 --> 01:18:42,520
LIAM: Yeah, you go (scraping).

1384
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:44,685
TRAVIS: Yeah, dragging it across the front, not
trying to penetrate it.

1385
01:18:44,685 --> 01:18:47,003
LIAM: You drag it across and this jagged line goes
(scraping).

1386
01:18:47,003 --> 01:18:48,686
ASHLY: You drag through all of them?

1387
01:18:48,686 --> 01:18:54,544
LIAM: All the way across. You break the lock, the
thin old rusted lock on the fourth one. Nothing

1388
01:18:54,544 --> 01:18:55,452
happens.

1389
01:18:55,452 --> 01:18:56,516
TRAVIS: Great.

1390
01:18:56,516 --> 01:18:58,151
SAM: Those are no longer mint in box.

1391
01:18:58,151 --> 01:19:02,489
TRAVIS: With my bonus action, I look at them all
stuck in that stupid chest.

1392
01:19:02,489 --> 01:19:12,435
LIAM: Okay, it's at that moment that Obby, behind
you, you hear (growling) and over your shoulder,

1393
01:19:12,435 --> 01:19:19,627
you see another one, a smaller one, but this one
starts to pustulate and get little bubbles all

1394
01:19:19,627 --> 01:19:23,602
over it and eyes go pop, pop, pop, all over and it
goes (screech).

1395
01:19:23,602 --> 01:19:28,782
MARY: It's The Thing! Give it CPR!

1396
01:19:28,782 --> 01:19:33,771
LIAM: It takes a bite at you, but you are so
scared shitless from the sound that comes out

1397
01:19:33,771 --> 01:19:38,644
behind you, you juke to the left and it goes
(screech) and didn't get you and now it's your turn.

1398
01:19:38,644 --> 01:19:52,296
SAM: Okay, I will attack the first one with a
dagger again, hoping to hit it this time. Nope.

1399
01:19:52,296 --> 01:19:54,879
13?

1400
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:56,163
LIAM: 13 hits.

1401
01:19:56,163 --> 01:20:03,587
SAM: Oh, okay, so eight, plus sneak attack damage,
right?

1402
01:20:03,587 --> 01:20:05,194
LIAM: That's right.

1403
01:20:05,194 --> 01:20:07,042
SAM: Ten.

1404
01:20:07,042 --> 01:20:12,663
LIAM: You just Julius Caesar-ed it, yeah. Oh, ten
total? Okay. Your dagger is stuck in its butt.

1405
01:20:12,663 --> 01:20:24,097
SAM: No problem, don't need it. I'm going to try
to move. Well no, first I'll use my bonus action.

1406
01:20:24,097 --> 01:20:33,660
The feature that only I can do is sleight of hand
on my bonus action. It says that I can try to open

1407
01:20:33,660 --> 01:20:36,424
a trap or a lock. I'm going to try to pry open
its mouth.

1408
01:20:36,424 --> 01:20:38,521
LIAM: Which one?

1409
01:20:38,521 --> 01:20:44,514
SAM: The one that is holding Devan. It's a trap or
a lock, maybe?

1410
01:20:44,514 --> 01:20:47,473
TRAVIS: You don't know.

1411
01:20:47,473 --> 01:20:51,950
SAM: I have a crowbar, so I'm going to jam it in
and try to pop it open.

1412
01:20:51,950 --> 01:20:54,171
LIAM: You're going to take your crowbar and try to
ram it open?

1413
01:20:54,171 --> 01:20:56,021
SAM: Just enough for her hand to get out.

1414
01:20:56,021 --> 01:20:58,198
LIAM: Okay, make a strength check.

1415
01:20:58,198 --> 01:21:01,373
SAM: 15.

1416
01:21:01,373 --> 01:21:11,826
LIAM: 15. You jam it in there and pull as hard as you
can. It does open, your hand is exposed, your

1417
01:21:11,826 --> 01:21:13,241
crowbar is stuck.

1418
01:21:13,241 --> 01:21:14,528
SAM: No problem.

1419
01:21:14,528 --> 01:21:18,672
LIAM: That's where we'll end that. Devan, we're on
to you.

1420
01:21:18,672 --> 01:21:20,170
LAURA: Can I pull my hand out?

1421
01:21:20,170 --> 01:21:22,811
LIAM: Yeah, you can make a strength check with
advantage.

1422
01:21:22,811 --> 01:21:28,931
LAURA: I'm so weak, though. Natural 20!

1423
01:21:28,931 --> 01:21:30,907
(cheering)

1424
01:21:30,907 --> 01:21:40,506
LIAM: You see bits of halfling skin on the thing's
tongue and you are free. That is your action.

1425
01:21:40,506 --> 01:21:41,981
LAURA: That is my action?

1426
01:21:41,981 --> 01:21:42,976
LIAM: Yeah.

1427
01:21:42,976 --> 01:21:44,621
LAURA: (sad trombone)

1428
01:21:44,621 --> 01:21:45,669
ASHLY: You should run.

1429
01:21:45,669 --> 01:21:56,180
LAURA: Okay, yeah, I will try to move away from
it. I don't want to waste the spell; I don't know!

1430
01:21:56,180 --> 01:21:58,717
TRAVIS: You don't know how long you'll be alive.

1431
01:21:58,717 --> 01:22:00,043
SAM: Two hours.

1432
01:22:00,043 --> 01:22:01,229
MARY: Tops.

1433
01:22:01,229 --> 01:22:06,818
LAURA: I'm going to Misty Step next to Tarvis.

1434
01:22:06,818 --> 01:22:11,036
TRAVIS: Whoa, what the shit!

1435
01:22:11,036 --> 01:22:16,536
LIAM: Nicely done, you are now safe for the
moment. Delweth, you are up.

1436
01:22:16,536 --> 01:22:24,717
MARY: I'm going to use Acid Splash on the fucker
who's got my rapier at the moment. I'm going to

1437
01:22:24,717 --> 01:22:29,879
use it right by the rapier, but not on it, in
hopes that I can pull it out.

1438
01:22:29,879 --> 01:22:34,827
LIAM: Okay, Acid Splash is just 1d6, yeah?

1439
01:22:34,827 --> 01:22:36,112
MARY: Yeah.

1440
01:22:36,112 --> 01:22:39,768
LIAM: Read that spell for me real quick so I don't
have to flip a million pages. There it is. No, I

1441
01:22:39,768 --> 01:22:42,157
got it. 1d6, succeed on a--

1442
01:22:42,157 --> 01:22:46,985
MARY: I hurl a bubble of acid, I choose one
creature within range, or two within range that

1443
01:22:46,985 --> 01:22:51,417
are within five feet of each other. Hey, are those
little bastards next to each other?

1444
01:22:51,417 --> 01:22:53,479
LIAM: What's your spell DC?

1445
01:22:53,479 --> 01:22:58,334
MARY: Exactly, it is five plus five.

1446
01:22:58,334 --> 01:23:00,304
LIAM: Oh, you know what? Doesn't matter.

1447
01:23:00,304 --> 01:23:01,558
MARY: It's a cantrip.

1448
01:23:01,558 --> 01:23:07,510
LIAM: I know. Your hand extends out over it and
glows a dark green and black swirl of color and

1449
01:23:07,510 --> 01:23:15,720
acid goes (dripping) and runs down over its eyes
and face and then washes off like water on a

1450
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:16,896
duck's back.

1451
01:23:16,896 --> 01:23:18,533
MARY: Like water on a duck's back?

1452
01:23:18,533 --> 01:23:20,076
LAURA: Oh, it's an acid creature.

1453
01:23:20,076 --> 01:23:23,177
MARY: So acid on acid doesn't work. I wasn't sure
if it did or not.

1454
01:23:23,177 --> 01:23:25,519
SAM and MARY: Had to try.

1455
01:23:25,519 --> 01:23:27,310
LIAM: And knowing is half the battle.

1456
01:23:27,310 --> 01:23:32,010
MARY: That's right. Hey there kids, do I have a
bonus action to disengage?

1457
01:23:32,010 --> 01:23:33,809
LIAM: You do have a bonus action, sure.

1458
01:23:33,809 --> 01:23:35,332
MARY: Really? I'd like to disengage.

1459
01:23:35,332 --> 01:23:36,560
LIAM: Okay, which way do you want to go?

1460
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:39,009
MARY: I want to go, yeah.

1461
01:23:39,009 --> 01:23:40,345
LIAM: All right, how about right there?

1462
01:23:40,345 --> 01:23:41,431
MARY: Yeah, that's good.

1463
01:23:41,431 --> 01:23:44,969
SAM: It's okay, Obby the Rat can take them both by
myself, apparently.

1464
01:23:44,969 --> 01:23:47,411
ASHLY: I'm there!

1465
01:23:47,411 --> 01:23:50,262
LIAM: Dren, you're up.

1466
01:23:50,262 --> 01:23:54,049
ASHLY: Okay, so if I attack a foe before they've
gone at the top of the fight I can attack with

1467
01:23:54,049 --> 01:23:55,442
advantage?

1468
01:23:55,442 --> 01:23:56,546
LIAM: Say again.

1469
01:23:56,546 --> 01:23:58,739
ASHLY: If I attack a foe before they've gone at
the top of a fight--

1470
01:23:58,739 --> 01:24:01,127
LIAM: It's at the very beginning of the fight if
you get the jump on them.

1471
01:24:01,127 --> 01:24:08,530
ASHLY: Fuck it, all right, I'll attack them
natural-like with my crossbow. 15?

1472
01:24:08,530 --> 01:24:10,045
LAURA: Plus five is 20.

1473
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:11,999
LIAM: Big guy or little guy?

1474
01:24:11,999 --> 01:24:14,490
ASHLY: The guy we've already been attacking that
had--

1475
01:24:14,490 --> 01:24:15,994
LIAM: The big guy? You got a 20, that hits.

1476
01:24:15,994 --> 01:24:18,599
ASHLY: Okay and then it's a 1d6.

1477
01:24:18,599 --> 01:24:21,682
LIAM: Plus sneak attack damage because Obby's got
its--

1478
01:24:21,682 --> 01:24:23,797
ASHLY: Oh wait, I can reroll it, right, or can I
not?

1479
01:24:23,797 --> 01:24:26,948
LAURA: Nah, it doesn't work on the damage rolls,
but that's okay. Plus three, so four and then

1480
01:24:26,948 --> 01:24:28,433
2d6.

1481
01:24:28,433 --> 01:24:30,593
ASHLY: Don't fuck me. Ten!

1482
01:24:30,593 --> 01:24:31,778
LAURA: So 14!

1483
01:24:31,778 --> 01:24:33,924
ASHLY: Woo, eat it!

1484
01:24:33,924 --> 01:24:35,104
LIAM: What was the weapon?

1485
01:24:35,104 --> 01:24:36,598
ASHLY: It was a crossbow.

1486
01:24:36,598 --> 01:24:43,516
LIAM: The thing's got its mouth open from where
Obby pried it open and Devan got away and your

1487
01:24:43,516 --> 01:24:51,925
bolt goes (impact) and gets it right in the eye.
(grunting) It's still going, though.

1488
01:24:51,925 --> 01:24:53,374
ASHLY: Aw, damn it.

1489
01:24:53,374 --> 01:24:56,050
LIAM: Tarvis, you're up.

1490
01:24:56,050 --> 01:24:57,501
TRAVIS: Which one did you hit?

1491
01:24:57,501 --> 01:24:58,821
ASHLY and LIAM: Big guy.

1492
01:24:58,821 --> 01:25:00,577
TRAVIS: Okay, I will go to big guy!

1493
01:25:00,577 --> 01:25:02,513
LIAM: You're going to go to him?

1494
01:25:02,513 --> 01:25:03,683
TRAVIS: Yes.

1495
01:25:03,683 --> 01:25:05,137
SAM: I want to go to him.

1496
01:25:05,137 --> 01:25:06,925
LIAM: Okay, you're there.

1497
01:25:06,925 --> 01:25:13,404
TRAVIS: And I will use a dagger to sneak attack
his anus.

1498
01:25:13,404 --> 01:25:17,770
LIAM: Okay. All right, roll to attack.

1499
01:25:17,770 --> 01:25:22,377
TRAVIS: Aw man, that's balls. Ten.

1500
01:25:22,377 --> 01:25:24,439
LIAM: Ten? Total?

1501
01:25:24,439 --> 01:25:25,531
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1502
01:25:25,531 --> 01:25:30,057
LIAM: Yeah, you really wanted to get at that anus
so bad, you went around and tried to get at it and

1503
01:25:30,057 --> 01:25:35,023
it snapped right at your junk, at the last second
you went oh jeez and pulled back and did not get

1504
01:25:35,023 --> 01:25:45,522
to the anus. Okay, the mimic, having a great shot
at your junk right now, bites your junk. You feel

1505
01:25:45,522 --> 01:25:57,322
teeth sink into your abdomen, and into your junk a
little bit. You take 11 piercing damage and the

1506
01:25:57,322 --> 01:25:59,569
acid leaks in after it for five.

1507
01:25:59,569 --> 01:26:02,044
LAURA: Are you okay, Tarvis?

1508
01:26:02,044 --> 01:26:15,105
LIAM: (growling) Yep, that's the end of that, now
the little one (screech), it was almost a natural

1509
01:26:15,105 --> 01:26:20,658
20 but it wasn't, it doesn't try to bite you but a
little glob of its body goes (whipping noise) and

1510
01:26:20,658 --> 01:26:26,965
you feel a little whip hit in the air right by
your ear, didn't hit you though. And now it's your turn.

1511
01:26:26,965 --> 01:26:33,767
SAM: All right, Obby focuses still on big one. Is
Travis within five feet of him?

1512
01:26:33,767 --> 01:26:34,757
TRAVIS: Who?

1513
01:26:34,757 --> 01:26:36,204
SAM: I mean Tarvis.

1514
01:26:36,204 --> 01:26:37,637
MARY: He's dyslexic.

1515
01:26:37,637 --> 01:26:39,357
SAM: Natural one.

1516
01:26:39,357 --> 01:26:45,265
TRAVIS: We're so fucked.

1517
01:26:45,265 --> 01:26:54,032
LIAM: You take your dagger and in rage for your
friend, you bring it down and it sinks into the

1518
01:26:54,032 --> 01:26:55,809
forearm of your friend.

1519
01:26:55,809 --> 01:26:57,399
TRAVIS: Me?

1520
01:26:57,399 --> 01:27:01,881
LIAM: You take two points of piercing damage.

1521
01:27:01,881 --> 01:27:03,345
TRAVIS: Awesome.

1522
01:27:03,345 --> 01:27:05,813
LIAM: Things go wrong sometimes.

1523
01:27:05,813 --> 01:27:07,660
TRAVIS: Still in the double digits.

1524
01:27:07,660 --> 01:27:15,925
SAM: That's no good, sorry! And then I will use my
bonus and move to disengage and move so I'm on the

1525
01:27:15,925 --> 01:27:20,320
other side of the big one, hopefully out of range
of the little one.

1526
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:26,279
LIAM: You can totally do that, yep, you're good.
It goes (yapping) as you leave. Now it is Devan,

1527
01:27:26,279 --> 01:27:27,424
your turn.

1528
01:27:27,424 --> 01:27:38,050
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to hop up over the chest
right there. Well, I'm going to Ray of Frost the

1529
01:27:38,050 --> 01:27:40,364
big one.

1530
01:27:40,364 --> 01:27:42,848
LIAM: The big one? You probably need a clear line
of sight--

1531
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:44,592
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to get a little closer,
yeah.

1532
01:27:44,592 --> 01:27:45,904
LIAM: Go for it.

1533
01:27:45,904 --> 01:27:48,238
SAM: (singing) Quicker than a Ray of Frost.

1534
01:27:48,238 --> 01:27:56,103
LAURA: On a hit, so I make a ranged spell attack.
But I don't know what my--

1535
01:27:56,103 --> 01:28:02,969
LIAM: Your bonus is six, so 20 and add six. What'd
you get?

1536
01:28:02,969 --> 01:28:04,127
LAURA: Ten.

1537
01:28:04,127 --> 01:28:12,648
LIAM: Ten. The frost totally freezes the chest
next to it shut. You still have a little bit of

1538
01:28:12,648 --> 01:28:14,012
movement if you like.

1539
01:28:14,012 --> 01:28:19,993
LAURA: Yeah, I hop up on a chest behind me.

1540
01:28:19,993 --> 01:28:22,525
LIAM: Over here? Okay and now we're on Tarvis.

1541
01:28:22,525 --> 01:28:24,088
TRAVIS: We're on me?

1542
01:28:24,088 --> 01:28:30,850
LIAM: Wait, no, sorry, I'm out of order, Delweth.
All the frigging 'D' names on this list.

1543
01:28:30,850 --> 01:28:44,630
MARY: All right, so the little fucker is by those
barrels to the left, yeah? I would like to move to

1544
01:28:44,630 --> 01:28:47,384
the top of the barrel all the way in the corner.

1545
01:28:47,384 --> 01:28:52,793
LIAM: Okay, you can do that, sure.

1546
01:28:52,793 --> 01:28:56,992
MARY: Okay, and I would like to cast Poison Spray
on the little fucker.

1547
01:28:56,992 --> 01:28:58,516
LIAM: Okay, go for it.

1548
01:28:58,516 --> 01:29:01,981
MARY: It's a cantrip, I just roll for damage
or--?

1549
01:29:01,981 --> 01:29:05,473
LIAM: Oh, it's a con save for my guy.

1550
01:29:05,473 --> 01:29:11,224
MARY: Yes, the creature must succeed on a
constitution saving throw.

1551
01:29:11,224 --> 01:29:12,784
LIAM: And it does not.

1552
01:29:12,784 --> 01:29:15,009
MARY: Okay, so 1d12, what's a d12--

1553
01:29:15,009 --> 01:29:18,553
LAURA: Ooh a d12, it looks like a ball, it's the
other one that looks like a ball.

1554
01:29:18,553 --> 01:29:20,008
TRAVIS: She's got it.

1555
01:29:20,008 --> 01:29:23,366
MARY: Four.

1556
01:29:23,366 --> 01:29:26,353
LAURA: We're rolling like shit!

1557
01:29:26,353 --> 01:29:28,609
MARY: Did he see me, was it a stealth?

1558
01:29:28,609 --> 01:29:36,169
LIAM: I don't think you can-- ooh stealth spell,
hmm, curious. No sneak attack damage on a spell,

1559
01:29:36,169 --> 01:29:43,249
but it does sputter and froth comes out of its
mouth and it pivots towards you.

1560
01:29:43,249 --> 01:29:45,346
LAURA: It's not dead yet, damn.

1561
01:29:45,346 --> 01:29:47,254
LIAM: And now we're on Dren.

1562
01:29:47,254 --> 01:29:48,499
MARY: Do I get a bonus action?

1563
01:29:48,499 --> 01:29:49,810
LIAM: You do, sorry, yes.

1564
01:29:49,810 --> 01:29:54,243
MARY: I would like to move back to the top of
the--

1565
01:29:54,243 --> 01:29:56,705
LIAM: You're out of movement though, to get there,
hopping on the barrels.

1566
01:29:56,705 --> 01:29:59,381
MARY: So what do I do, I get hide, disengage--

1567
01:29:59,381 --> 01:30:01,819
TRAVIS: Hide, disengage, dash-- oh well you can't
dash--

1568
01:30:01,819 --> 01:30:04,494
SAM: You can dash, right?

1569
01:30:04,494 --> 01:30:06,482
LIAM: It's looking right at you.

1570
01:30:06,482 --> 01:30:07,827
MARY: It's looking right at me.

1571
01:30:07,827 --> 01:30:08,981
LIAM: You're not going to be able to hide.

1572
01:30:08,981 --> 01:30:10,159
MARY: I do this.

1573
01:30:10,159 --> 01:30:12,658
LIAM: It doesn't get it, it's still slobbering--

1574
01:30:12,658 --> 01:30:13,995
MARY: I do this.

1575
01:30:13,995 --> 01:30:15,947
LIAM: (dying noise)

1576
01:30:15,947 --> 01:30:17,516
MARY: It dies.

1577
01:30:17,516 --> 01:30:20,665
LIAM: All right, so Dren.

1578
01:30:20,665 --> 01:30:22,061
ASHLY: Can the big dude see me?

1579
01:30:22,061 --> 01:30:27,401
LIAM: The big dude see you? Kind of, it's got one
eye with a crossbow bolt in it.

1580
01:30:27,401 --> 01:30:28,941
ASHLY: Could I do a sneak attack?

1581
01:30:28,941 --> 01:30:34,171
LIAM: Yeah, it's surrounded. This is Julius Caesar
time here. Are you throwing something or are you

1582
01:30:34,171 --> 01:30:35,440
moving over there?

1583
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:39,442
ASHLY: I'm doing a crossbow with a natty 20! So
25.

1584
01:30:39,442 --> 01:30:41,217
LIAM: How do you want to do this?

1585
01:30:41,217 --> 01:30:43,209
(cheering)

1586
01:30:43,209 --> 01:30:44,970
ASHLY: Well I want to take my dagger--

1587
01:30:44,970 --> 01:30:47,493
LIAM: What happened to the crossbow?

1588
01:30:47,493 --> 01:30:52,933
ASHLY: Well I didn't realize I was going to kill
him, now I'm in a flying leap, but that's fine,

1589
01:30:52,933 --> 01:30:57,807
I'll take an arrow and do a flying leap down on
his eye.

1590
01:30:57,807 --> 01:31:04,922
LIAM: You pull a bolt out and go, "Fuck it," and
ram it down into its protruding, bulbous purplish

1591
01:31:04,922 --> 01:31:13,412
gums and stab it and it goes (gurgling) and vomit
spills out of it and goes all over Tarvis' feet.

1592
01:31:13,412 --> 01:31:15,182
ASHLY: Sorry, Tarvis!

1593
01:31:15,182 --> 01:31:18,006
LIAM: Anything else you want to do?

1594
01:31:18,006 --> 01:31:20,954
ASHLY: I want to do this.

1595
01:31:20,954 --> 01:31:24,906
LIAM: Yeah okay. Tarvis, what would you like to
do?

1596
01:31:24,906 --> 01:31:30,111
TRAVIS: I would like to be useful in this fight in
any capacity and would like to hop the chest and

1597
01:31:30,111 --> 01:31:33,266
move towards the last remaining piece of shit.

1598
01:31:33,266 --> 01:31:34,867
LIAM: Dropping blood as you go.

1599
01:31:34,867 --> 01:31:37,563
MARY: Did he get any damage from the vomit on his
feet?

1600
01:31:37,563 --> 01:31:44,413
LIAM: No, his boots are already burned from acid,
I think they made a nice little crust on the

1601
01:31:44,413 --> 01:31:45,442
bottom.

1602
01:31:45,442 --> 01:31:48,398
TRAVIS: I'll take this scimitar. It's not engaged
by anybody else right, so no sneak attack damage?

1603
01:31:48,398 --> 01:31:49,531
LIAM: That's correct.

1604
01:31:49,531 --> 01:31:51,014
MARY: It's looking at me.

1605
01:31:51,014 --> 01:31:53,442
LIAM: It's got to be within five feet of his
friend.

1606
01:31:53,442 --> 01:31:58,649
TRAVIS: I will be the engagee for everyone else
and I will hit it with my scimitar because I'm

1607
01:31:58,649 --> 01:32:06,068
such a good fucking leader. I'll roll a different
dice. Jesus, nipples on a horse.

1608
01:32:06,068 --> 01:32:08,629
LIAM: What'd you get there?

1609
01:32:08,629 --> 01:32:09,515
TRAVIS: Ten.

1610
01:32:09,515 --> 01:32:14,246
LIAM: Ten, oh man, your guts are-- you're lucky
they're not spilling out, and you are in so much

1611
01:32:14,246 --> 01:32:20,491
pain that you swing and cramp and burning pain up
to the nipple, up to the horse nipple, and your

1612
01:32:20,491 --> 01:32:26,632
sword goes into a regular chest next to the thing.
Now it is the mimic's turn and it goes

1613
01:32:26,632 --> 01:32:34,035
(snickering) and another gooey rubber band punches
out at you--

1614
01:32:34,035 --> 01:32:36,473
TRAVIS: Wait! Can I use my bonus action to
disengage?

1615
01:32:36,473 --> 01:32:37,962
LIAM: Yeah, you can.

1616
01:32:37,962 --> 01:32:42,370
TRAVIS: I know, I want to do something.

1617
01:32:42,370 --> 01:32:47,731
LIAM: I'm going to say that's as far as you get,
and the little booger that came out and went

1618
01:32:47,731 --> 01:32:49,603
(whiplash), but didn't reach you.

1619
01:32:49,603 --> 01:32:52,491
MARY: Well done, Tarvis.

1620
01:32:52,491 --> 01:32:54,919
LIAM: Now it is Obby the Rat's turn.

1621
01:32:54,919 --> 01:33:02,008
SAM: Obby the Rat would like to move in and
attack, so I will take a couple steps towards him,

1622
01:33:02,008 --> 01:33:04,735
and I get a 14.

1623
01:33:04,735 --> 01:33:06,685
LIAM: Yes, that hits.

1624
01:33:06,685 --> 01:33:08,476
TRAVIS: I don't know what that's like.

1625
01:33:08,476 --> 01:33:10,826
ASHLY: It's really great.

1626
01:33:10,826 --> 01:33:15,642
SAM: Seven, it's not a sneak attack right? Travis
is out of the way? Seven points.

1627
01:33:15,642 --> 01:33:18,196
LIAM: Seven points, okay, and you use what
weapon?

1628
01:33:18,196 --> 01:33:19,260
SAM: Dagger.

1629
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:25,739
LIAM: Dagger, okay. You jam the dagger down into
one of its 50 eyes, and it goes in diagonal, and

1630
01:33:25,739 --> 01:33:31,964
this fucking knife is glued onto this creature's
body. Keep track of your daggers, guys.

1631
01:33:31,964 --> 01:33:39,413
SAM: I will bonus action try to pull the dagger
out with sleight of hand.

1632
01:33:39,413 --> 01:33:50,231
LIAM: Jesus, make a dexterity check at
disadvantage.

1633
01:33:50,231 --> 01:33:55,652
SAM: Not good. Slightly better. Ten.

1634
01:33:55,652 --> 01:34:05,436
LIAM: No. You go, (grabbing noises) "Oh shit." And
that's it, you are staying put. Now we're back to

1635
01:34:05,436 --> 01:34:06,615
Devan.

1636
01:34:06,615 --> 01:34:14,857
LAURA: I'm going to hop down from the chests, the
other direction. The ones that Tarvis ran his

1637
01:34:14,857 --> 01:34:18,669
swords over, can I go see if any of those are
mimics?

1638
01:34:18,669 --> 01:34:23,795
LIAM: The one that he dragged his blade across? What
do you want to do? They look like scarred chests.

1639
01:34:23,795 --> 01:34:28,381
LAURA: You said one of the locks got busted when
he did it, can I open it up?

1640
01:34:28,381 --> 01:34:30,726
LIAM: Yeah you do, it's full of electrum.

1641
01:34:30,726 --> 01:34:31,923
LAURA: Electrum?

1642
01:34:31,923 --> 01:34:32,917
LIAM: Coins.

1643
01:34:32,917 --> 01:34:34,129
LAURA: I want them.

1644
01:34:34,129 --> 01:34:35,235
LIAM: Okay.

1645
01:34:35,235 --> 01:34:36,872
MARY: Greed.

1646
01:34:36,872 --> 01:34:46,338
LAURA: Do I have anything on me that I can dig in?
I take my cloak off and I dust it in there to see

1647
01:34:46,338 --> 01:34:48,127
if it bites at it.

1648
01:34:48,127 --> 01:34:54,958
LIAM: No, nothing's biting you, you get, I don't
know, 80, 100, 120 pieces of electrum into the

1649
01:34:54,958 --> 01:34:56,293
hood of your cloak.

1650
01:34:56,293 --> 01:34:57,921
TRAVIS: What's electrum?

1651
01:34:57,921 --> 01:34:58,783
LAURA: I don't know.

1652
01:34:58,783 --> 01:35:00,171
LIAM: It's another currency.

1653
01:35:00,171 --> 01:35:01,627
MARY: Unobtainium!

1654
01:35:01,627 --> 01:35:09,072
LIAM: All right, do you want to move any more? Or
are you going to stay here and drool on the coin?

1655
01:35:09,072 --> 01:35:10,605
LAURA: I'm going to keep looking at coins.

1656
01:35:10,605 --> 01:35:12,509
LIAM: Cool, okay, Delweth, you are up!

1657
01:35:12,509 --> 01:35:16,104
MARY: All right, let's Poison Spray that little
fucker one more time.

1658
01:35:16,104 --> 01:35:17,740
TRAVIS: Help me!

1659
01:35:17,740 --> 01:35:23,127
MARY: I am. I will Poison Spray the
multi-eyeballed thing.

1660
01:35:23,127 --> 01:35:30,873
LIAM: You go. So noxious gray-purple fume
floats--

1661
01:35:30,873 --> 01:35:32,032
MARY: Do I need to--

1662
01:35:32,032 --> 01:35:36,003
LIAM: You don't need to do anything. It needs to
do something. It just happens. No, it does

1663
01:35:36,003 --> 01:35:41,691
terribly again, so another poof of awful
surrounds the thing. Roll for damage.

1664
01:35:41,691 --> 01:35:45,016
MARY: On my butt. All right, roll for damage. What
do I roll on this?

1665
01:35:45,016 --> 01:35:47,505
TRAVIS: What do you roll on that?

1666
01:35:47,505 --> 01:35:56,668
MARY: 1d12. Is that a d12? Five!

1667
01:35:56,668 --> 01:35:58,308
TRAVIS: Plus anything?

1668
01:35:58,308 --> 01:36:02,414
MARY: Do I get plus anything on my spells? Spell
bonus attack?

1669
01:36:02,414 --> 01:36:08,595
LIAM: No, but it looks really miserable. The shape
is changing and it looks more like a chest and

1670
01:36:08,595 --> 01:36:13,581
then less like a chest and the eyes shrink back in
and go bloodshot. It looks disgusting, it doesn't

1671
01:36:13,581 --> 01:36:16,504
look happy. And we are now onto Dren.

1672
01:36:16,504 --> 01:36:17,881
TRAVIS: Dren, show them how we do!

1673
01:36:17,881 --> 01:36:22,074
ASHLY: Did he get rid of my shortsword? Do I have
my shortsword?

1674
01:36:22,074 --> 01:36:24,203
LIAM: It's sitting there sticking out of him.

1675
01:36:24,203 --> 01:36:31,453
ASHLY: I'll kill him with my crossbow. 15?

1676
01:36:31,453 --> 01:36:35,135
LIAM: 15 hits. Roll for damage plus sneak attack
damage.

1677
01:36:35,135 --> 01:36:42,549
ASHLY: Four and then sneak attack. Eight.

1678
01:36:42,549 --> 01:36:47,754
LIAM: Okay, so you stand coolly looking at it. You
watch as Delweth sends out this poof of noxious

1679
01:36:47,754 --> 01:36:58,441
gas around it. It sputters, it shifts, it changes.
You coolly go (crossbow bolt firing) (gurgling screams).

1680
01:36:58,441 --> 01:36:59,660
ASHLY: MVP!

1681
01:36:59,660 --> 01:37:01,941
(cheering)

1682
01:37:01,941 --> 01:37:03,615
TRAVIS: MVP!

1683
01:37:03,615 --> 01:37:05,273
MARY: Both chests down.

1684
01:37:05,273 --> 01:37:09,625
ASHLY: Do you guys want to hear haikus?

1685
01:37:09,625 --> 01:37:13,091
LIAM: I'd love to hear a haiku. Do you have one
ready for us?

1686
01:37:13,091 --> 01:37:24,440
ASHLY: I killed all the chest...s. They are now
all dead. So I am the best, y'all.

1687
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:33,979
LIAM: So the room falls quiet, there are two
slobbery disgusting messes with daggers and your

1688
01:37:33,979 --> 01:37:40,471
shortsword is sticking out of it and you're
surrounded by money.

1689
01:37:40,471 --> 01:37:42,843
TRAVIS: I race over to Devan.

1690
01:37:42,843 --> 01:37:46,586
LAURA: Good job, guys! That was really scary, I'm
sorry about that, Tarvis.

1691
01:37:46,586 --> 01:37:47,829
TRAVIS: Are you all right?

1692
01:37:47,829 --> 01:37:50,384
SAM: Oh, he cares?

1693
01:37:50,384 --> 01:37:54,370
LAURA: I insight check him. I know he's full of
shit. Can I insight check him?

1694
01:37:54,370 --> 01:37:55,668
LIAM: Yes.

1695
01:37:55,668 --> 01:37:58,985
TRAVIS: I will kill her.

1696
01:37:58,985 --> 01:38:02,056
LAURA: 17.

1697
01:38:02,056 --> 01:38:05,288
LIAM: Why don't you roll against it?

1698
01:38:05,288 --> 01:38:10,453
TRAVIS: What is it, insight or wisdom?

1699
01:38:10,453 --> 01:38:11,684
LAURA: Insight.

1700
01:38:11,684 --> 01:38:12,826
MARY: Wisdom.

1701
01:38:12,826 --> 01:38:16,208
LIAM: Let's do straight charisma. I'm sure I'm
fudging it, but eh.

1702
01:38:16,208 --> 01:38:18,611
TRAVIS: I don't even have a thing for that.

1703
01:38:18,611 --> 01:38:22,021
MARY: Zero so it's five.

1704
01:38:22,021 --> 01:38:23,338
TRAVIS: Five.

1705
01:38:23,338 --> 01:38:27,255
LAURA: So I know if he's full of shit? Were you
lying or were you telling the truth?

1706
01:38:27,255 --> 01:38:32,794
TRAVIS: Well, you're the only one that knows where
the shit in this house is, so I was telling the

1707
01:38:32,794 --> 01:38:34,452
truth. Are you okay?

1708
01:38:34,452 --> 01:38:42,516
LAURA: Yeah, I'm okay. Wow, sorry I did that.
They've never been monsters before. It's just been

1709
01:38:42,516 --> 01:38:44,528
actual chests of gold.

1710
01:38:44,528 --> 01:38:46,864
TRAVIS: Nice, good to know. What's in the chest?

1711
01:38:46,864 --> 01:38:49,944
LAURA: What chest? Which one? All of them? Gold!

1712
01:38:49,944 --> 01:38:52,112
TRAVIS: The one right in front of you, what's that
currency?

1713
01:38:52,112 --> 01:38:53,610
LAURA: Oh, it's electrum.

1714
01:38:53,610 --> 01:38:55,131
SAM: Do we know what that is?

1715
01:38:55,131 --> 01:38:58,264
LIAM: It's a different value than gold.

1716
01:38:58,264 --> 01:38:59,803
TRAVIS: Like more than platinum?

1717
01:38:59,803 --> 01:39:01,276
LIAM: No, less than gold.

1718
01:39:01,276 --> 01:39:02,729
LAURA: Yeah, it's not as good as gold.

1719
01:39:02,729 --> 01:39:03,982
MARY: More than sterling, less than gold?

1720
01:39:03,982 --> 01:39:05,660
LAURA: It's like a nickel to a quarter!

1721
01:39:05,660 --> 01:39:09,591
TRAVIS: Glad you're all right, do us a favor:
remember that thing we said about gambling with

1722
01:39:09,591 --> 01:39:10,933
our lives?

1723
01:39:10,933 --> 01:39:16,333
MARY: That's two strikes, I'm throwing that out
there. That's two. I'm keeping score.

1724
01:39:16,333 --> 01:39:19,112
LAURA: Do you want to kill me and you'll never get
the--? Do you want to kill me?

1725
01:39:19,112 --> 01:39:20,357
TRAVIS: Oh, I wouldn't tempt her--

1726
01:39:20,357 --> 01:39:24,020
ASHLY: Hey, guys! There's a bunch of chests we
haven't opened here, right? Let's check what's in

1727
01:39:24,020 --> 01:39:25,148
the chests!

1728
01:39:25,148 --> 01:39:27,941
SAM: We are here to get a large jewel. Not gold.

1729
01:39:27,941 --> 01:39:29,973
LAURA: But maybe she's keeping the jewel in one of
the chests.

1730
01:39:29,973 --> 01:39:30,934
ASHLY: Yeah!

1731
01:39:30,934 --> 01:39:33,834
TRAVIS: Dren, I promise we will fill our pockets
on the way out because this will certainly be the

1732
01:39:33,834 --> 01:39:36,621
way that we leave, fair enough? We don't want to
have a little jingle-jangle--

1733
01:39:36,621 --> 01:39:40,093
LAURA: Maybe the mimic has the thing inside of
it!

1734
01:39:40,093 --> 01:39:41,313
ASHLY: Yeah!

1735
01:39:41,313 --> 01:39:43,676
MARY: I go over and try to free my rapier from
the--

1736
01:39:43,676 --> 01:39:48,467
LIAM: Yeah, it takes like a minute and a
half, but without the thing trying to bite you,

1737
01:39:48,467 --> 01:39:52,181
you are able to plant your foot on it, just the
edge, the corner of your boot and pull for a while

1738
01:39:52,181 --> 01:39:54,673
and it does come free.

1739
01:39:54,673 --> 01:39:56,216
TRAVIS: Other than the-- shit, sorry.

1740
01:39:56,216 --> 01:39:57,586
LIAM: It's okay, it smells bad.

1741
01:39:57,586 --> 01:39:59,727
MARY: There's still acid on it or is it just
glop?

1742
01:39:59,727 --> 01:40:02,714
LIAM: Yeah, I mean it's not as pretty as when you
got it at the shop, but it's functional.

1743
01:40:02,714 --> 01:40:07,325
TRAVIS: Other than the chests in the room, are
there any bookcases, or other paperwork like there

1744
01:40:07,325 --> 01:40:08,460
was in the other room?

1745
01:40:08,460 --> 01:40:14,951
LIAM: In here there are shelves lining these walls
as well, and there's clay pots with more coins in

1746
01:40:14,951 --> 01:40:28,738
them, and you see a tray with ingots, it looks
like gold. There's bolts of very fine fabric. You

1747
01:40:28,738 --> 01:40:31,740
open one box that is full of precious stones.

1748
01:40:31,740 --> 01:40:37,930
LAURA: Is there a big emerald in there? Is that
the stone you're looking for?

1749
01:40:37,930 --> 01:40:39,333
TRAVIS: Would you like to check?

1750
01:40:39,333 --> 01:40:40,694
LAURA: Sure!

1751
01:40:40,694 --> 01:40:42,104
LIAM: Box is about this big.

1752
01:40:42,104 --> 01:40:43,723
LAURA: Oh. I don't think this is the one.

1753
01:40:43,723 --> 01:40:49,382
TRAVIS: No. How about we each get one of those
nice, pretty stones, and then we don't reach in

1754
01:40:49,382 --> 01:40:51,673
any more booty until we leave? How about that?

1755
01:40:51,673 --> 01:40:56,854
ASHLY: You don't think the jewel's in any of these
chests?

1756
01:40:56,854 --> 01:40:58,341
LAURA: It really would be smart to look.

1757
01:40:58,341 --> 01:40:59,926
TRAVIS: Sure. Let's search the chests.

1758
01:40:59,926 --> 01:41:03,283
LAURA: I'll search the room for the jewel.

1759
01:41:03,283 --> 01:41:06,224
TRAVIS: Check them for traps before you open
them.

1760
01:41:06,224 --> 01:41:07,369
LAURA: Yeah.

1761
01:41:07,369 --> 01:41:10,501
MARY: I'll check the barrels that I was standing
on for traps.

1762
01:41:10,501 --> 01:41:15,543
LIAM: For traps? Okay, make a perception check.
Anyone who wants to check, make a perception check.

1763
01:41:15,543 --> 01:41:18,751
SAM: There's no other doors, right?

1764
01:41:18,751 --> 01:41:20,345
LIAM: There is another door.

1765
01:41:20,345 --> 01:41:21,711
MARY: Ten.

1766
01:41:21,711 --> 01:41:23,261
TRAVIS: 22.

1767
01:41:23,261 --> 01:41:25,363
ASHLY: 18.

1768
01:41:25,363 --> 01:41:26,953
LAURA: 11.

1769
01:41:26,953 --> 01:41:32,672
LIAM: In the interest of time, you all fan out,
open everything you can find, drag your hand

1770
01:41:32,672 --> 01:41:40,691
through chests full of wealth. There is a lot of
money here. There is no giant emerald.

1771
01:41:40,691 --> 01:41:43,414
LAURA: I pocket as much as I can.

1772
01:41:43,414 --> 01:41:45,415
LIAM: Make a stealth check.

1773
01:41:45,415 --> 01:41:54,687
LAURA: Shit. Six. Damn it!

1774
01:41:54,687 --> 01:41:57,945
LIAM: Coins are spilling around your feet going
(clinking).

1775
01:41:57,945 --> 01:42:00,165
TRAVIS: Obby?

1776
01:42:00,165 --> 01:42:01,767
SAM: Yes, sir.

1777
01:42:01,767 --> 01:42:04,572
TRAVIS: Do me a favor. Will you cut some holes in
all of her pockets, please?

1778
01:42:04,572 --> 01:42:06,318
LAURA: Aw, come on!

1779
01:42:06,318 --> 01:42:11,432
SAM: I retrieve my disgusting daggers from the
beast.

1780
01:42:11,432 --> 01:42:13,231
LIAM: Three minutes later they come out.

1781
01:42:13,231 --> 01:42:17,271
SAM: And I poke little holes all over. What are
you wearing?

1782
01:42:17,271 --> 01:42:19,310
LAURA: Really nice, awesome clothes.

1783
01:42:19,310 --> 01:42:23,269
MARY: No armor or anything?

1784
01:42:23,269 --> 01:42:27,657
LIAM: She's wearing some above-average robes and a
nice fur-lined cloak.

1785
01:42:27,657 --> 01:42:30,791
SAM: And it all has little holes in it.

1786
01:42:30,791 --> 01:42:33,165
LAURA: Damn it! This was worth a lot of money!

1787
01:42:33,165 --> 01:42:35,333
LIAM: You'll win it back.

1788
01:42:35,333 --> 01:42:40,139
MARY: I go over and grab a ruby out of that box. I
search for a ruby.

1789
01:42:40,139 --> 01:42:41,484
LIAM: Obviously?

1790
01:42:41,484 --> 01:42:43,522
MARY: Yeah. You said we could all take one.

1791
01:42:43,522 --> 01:42:44,604
TRAVIS: I did.

1792
01:42:44,604 --> 01:42:48,681
MARY: So I did. I'm taking a ruby. That big, I
find one.

1793
01:42:48,681 --> 01:42:50,860
LIAM: Okay. Biggest one in the box.

1794
01:42:50,860 --> 01:42:52,448
TRAVIS: I move to the door.

1795
01:42:52,448 --> 01:42:54,824
LIAM: All right. Are we moving out?

1796
01:42:54,824 --> 01:42:55,837
ASHLY: Yes.

1797
01:42:55,837 --> 01:42:58,430
TRAVIS: We're checking it for traps and seeing if
it's locked.

1798
01:42:58,430 --> 01:42:59,710
LIAM: Make a perception check.

1799
01:42:59,710 --> 01:43:01,318
MARY: Do you want me to Mage Hand the door?

1800
01:43:01,318 --> 01:43:03,376
ASHLY: I grab my shortsword before all of this,
also.

1801
01:43:03,376 --> 01:43:06,028
LAURA: Can I look around the room for the rat
symbol anywhere?

1802
01:43:06,028 --> 01:43:09,318
LIAM: Did you make a perception check already?

1803
01:43:09,318 --> 01:43:16,676
LAURA: I was looking for the jewel before.

1804
01:43:16,676 --> 01:43:18,274
LIAM: Okay. Make a perception check.

1805
01:43:18,274 --> 01:43:21,436
LAURA: Oh! Natural 20!

1806
01:43:21,436 --> 01:43:24,829
LIAM: This is a plain room full of money.

1807
01:43:24,829 --> 01:43:28,664
LAURA: Damn it, what a damn waste of a 20.

1808
01:43:28,664 --> 01:43:32,389
TRAVIS: So if you have been to the basement, then
you're obviously familiar with this room.

1809
01:43:32,389 --> 01:43:33,565
LAURA: This is the basement.

1810
01:43:33,565 --> 01:43:35,129
TRAVIS: This is the basement?

1811
01:43:35,129 --> 01:43:36,283
LAURA: This is the basement.

1812
01:43:36,283 --> 01:43:37,285
SAM: So what's next?

1813
01:43:37,285 --> 01:43:40,345
LAURA: Upstairs. You know, the entryway,
and then--

1814
01:43:40,345 --> 01:43:46,832
LIAM: No, it's been a while, think about it. Above
here is your grandmother's office. The office

1815
01:43:46,832 --> 01:43:48,667
leads to the rest of the first floor.

1816
01:43:48,667 --> 01:43:56,582
TRAVIS: Wait a minute. Those bookshelves--
Delweth, will you pull those away from the wall?

1817
01:43:56,582 --> 01:44:04,142
MARY: Of course. I check them for traps? We've
already done that. I pull away the bookshelves,

1818
01:44:04,142 --> 01:44:06,163
see if there's anything behind them.

1819
01:44:06,163 --> 01:44:10,746
LIAM: Things spill off, a couple of things break
as they hit the ground. Just a plain wall behind it.

1820
01:44:10,746 --> 01:44:12,764
MARY: There's nothing there, Tarvis.

1821
01:44:12,764 --> 01:44:14,904
TRAVIS: The floor is stone? Wood?

1822
01:44:14,904 --> 01:44:17,096
LIAM: It is wood.

1823
01:44:17,096 --> 01:44:26,037
LAURA: Well, if it's not in here, the only other
place that I can think of that it would be--

1824
01:44:26,037 --> 01:44:29,485
(groans)

1825
01:44:29,485 --> 01:44:30,682
ASHLY: What?

1826
01:44:30,682 --> 01:44:32,623
LAURA: Is down the hallway.

1827
01:44:32,623 --> 01:44:34,419
SAM: What room is that?

1828
01:44:34,419 --> 01:44:36,561
LAURA: It's upstairs. Up-up.

1829
01:44:36,561 --> 01:44:38,460
TRAVIS: Does this door lead upstairs?

1830
01:44:38,460 --> 01:44:42,225
LAURA: Well, yeah. I mean, it's the basement. Where
else is it going to lead?

1831
01:44:42,225 --> 01:44:43,904
TRAVIS: The wine cellar?

1832
01:44:43,904 --> 01:44:46,145
LAURA: It leads to her office.

1833
01:44:46,145 --> 01:44:49,618
MARY: All right. I check the door for traps.

1834
01:44:49,618 --> 01:44:53,610
LIAM: Well you checked already, you didn't find
any.

1835
01:44:53,610 --> 01:44:54,763
TRAVIS: 23.

1836
01:44:54,763 --> 01:44:55,890
MARY: I'll Mage Hand the door.

1837
01:44:55,890 --> 01:45:00,714
LIAM: Okay. The door goes (squeak). It is not
locked, it is not trapped that you can tell.

1838
01:45:00,714 --> 01:45:03,531
MARY: Pecking order. Who wants to go first?

1839
01:45:03,531 --> 01:45:05,226
ASHLY: Do you want me to scout, boss?

1840
01:45:05,226 --> 01:45:06,519
TRAVIS: Yes, Dren.

1841
01:45:06,519 --> 01:45:13,683
ASHLY: Okay. Stealthily, it's a million. 34.

1842
01:45:13,683 --> 01:45:17,383
LIAM: Okay. And you're in the lead, Dren? Did I
hear that right?

1843
01:45:17,383 --> 01:45:18,985
ASHLY: I'm scouting it out.

1844
01:45:18,985 --> 01:45:20,103
LIAM: Yeah, you're going up ahead?

1845
01:45:20,103 --> 01:45:21,386
ASHLY: Uh-huh.

1846
01:45:21,386 --> 01:45:28,156
LIAM: Okay, so you creep up, and you come up a
stairway, with little walls on each side, and you

1847
01:45:28,156 --> 01:45:34,529
start to see the insides of a nice office. She's
got a thing for these little globes of light. You

1848
01:45:34,529 --> 01:45:41,183
come up into a fairly well-lit room, it's big,
you're on one end of a large office. And the first

1849
01:45:41,183 --> 01:45:47,289
thing you see over there seems to be desk tables,
stuff you associate with an office. But right

1850
01:45:47,289 --> 01:45:54,946
where you're coming out, you see in the middle of
the floor going up to the ceiling a weird looking

1851
01:45:54,946 --> 01:46:04,819
brass column, going from the floor all the way up
to the ceiling. And there are constellations that

1852
01:46:04,819 --> 01:46:12,398
you are familiar with from books and from living
in Emon as long as you have, spiraling beautifully

1853
01:46:12,398 --> 01:46:22,161
all the way up this column, up to the ceiling. And
then around that are dog beds, five dog beds. You

1854
01:46:22,161 --> 01:46:29,643
also see a really large bone in the largest one.
You see a ragged hydra doll with a couple of heads

1855
01:46:29,643 --> 01:46:37,149
ripped away, and it looks like it's been whipped
around ragged. There's a crude leather ball made

1856
01:46:37,149 --> 01:46:43,145
out of leather fabric wrapped up, and that's this
side of the room.

1857
01:46:43,145 --> 01:46:48,449
ASHLY: I skitter back to everyone and I go,
Devan?

1858
01:46:48,449 --> 01:46:49,598
LAURA: Yeah.

1859
01:46:49,721 --> 01:46:51,469
ASHLY: Does your grandma like dogs?

1860
01:46:51,469 --> 01:46:56,424
LAURA: Does my grandma like dogs?

1861
01:46:56,424 --> 01:46:58,565
ASHLY: Like own them?

1862
01:46:58,565 --> 01:47:00,557
LIAM: She didn't have dogs when you lived here.

1863
01:47:00,557 --> 01:47:03,802
LAURA: Yeah, like, well, I mean not that I know
of. Why?

1864
01:47:03,802 --> 01:47:09,480
ASHLY: Because there's a bunch of beds with really
big bones and stuff ripped apart up there. Like

1865
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:10,818
there's a bunch of dogs.

1866
01:47:10,818 --> 01:47:13,678
LAURA: Well my grandma is <i>really</i> paranoid.

1867
01:47:13,678 --> 01:47:16,559
ASHLY: Like they look like they're big dogs.

1868
01:47:16,559 --> 01:47:18,663
TRAVIS: You didn't see any up there?

1869
01:47:18,663 --> 01:47:25,621
ASHLY: No, but there's a big bone, and a thing
with its head ripped off. It doesn't look very

1870
01:47:25,621 --> 01:47:28,671
good. And a pretty thing in the middle, but I am
mostly worried about the dogs.

1871
01:47:28,671 --> 01:47:31,148
MARY: What pretty thing in the middle?

1872
01:47:31,148 --> 01:47:34,538
ASHLY: It's a brass pillar with like
constellations winding up it.

1873
01:47:34,538 --> 01:47:40,111
MARY: Huh. What do you think? What's your judgment
in all of this?

1874
01:47:40,111 --> 01:47:42,679
ASHLY: Looks like there's probably a bunch of
scary dogs there.

1875
01:47:42,679 --> 01:47:43,728
TRAVIS: Right.

1876
01:47:43,728 --> 01:47:45,513
MARY: But they're not in the room?

1877
01:47:45,513 --> 01:47:46,496
ASHLY: No.

1878
01:47:46,496 --> 01:47:50,174
MARY: Did you see any other doors, did you see
anything shut? Did you see...?

1879
01:47:50,174 --> 01:47:51,508
ASHLY: Did I?

1880
01:47:51,508 --> 01:47:53,358
LIAM and ASHLY: No.

1881
01:47:53,358 --> 01:47:57,987
MARY: Should we stealth up and see what happens?
I'm so sorry, I leave it to you, my fearless

1882
01:47:57,987 --> 01:47:59,201
leader.

1883
01:47:59,201 --> 01:48:06,954
TRAVIS: You read my mind, we're certainly not
going to find anything in here. What is the floor

1884
01:48:06,954 --> 01:48:08,928
made of in the room that she looked at?

1885
01:48:08,928 --> 01:48:10,895
LIAM: Are you up there?

1886
01:48:10,895 --> 01:48:14,283
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll go to the doorway.

1887
01:48:14,283 --> 01:48:16,675
LIAM: Doorway then stairs up out of this
basement.

1888
01:48:16,675 --> 01:48:17,651
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1889
01:48:17,651 --> 01:48:19,041
LIAM: So you're going up to the top of the
stairs?

1890
01:48:19,041 --> 01:48:20,114
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1891
01:48:20,114 --> 01:48:24,909
LIAM: Polished wood. And from where you can see,
you see a couple of dog beds. You don't see them all

1892
01:48:24,909 --> 01:48:29,090
yet because you aren't that far into the room.
Aside from the dog beds, it looks like a very

1893
01:48:29,090 --> 01:48:30,232
beautiful room.

1894
01:48:30,232 --> 01:48:34,182
TRAVIS: Can I see any animal hair, or any saliva
dried on the floor, any claw marks?

1895
01:48:34,182 --> 01:48:36,048
LIAM: Make a perception check.

1896
01:48:36,048 --> 01:48:40,948
TRAVIS: 14.

1897
01:48:40,948 --> 01:48:46,669
LIAM: 14? Yeah, on the dog beds you do see very
short, not a lot, and not long hairs, like short

1898
01:48:46,669 --> 01:48:49,175
hair. Bristly almost.

1899
01:48:49,175 --> 01:48:53,685
TRAVIS: What about the ceiling? Can I see the
ceiling at all? How high is it?

1900
01:48:53,685 --> 01:48:58,788
LIAM: Oh it's like 20 feet up. It's a very
beautiful room.

1901
01:48:58,788 --> 01:49:00,520
TRAVIS: No light fixtures, no chandeliers?

1902
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:05,512
LIAM: There's a couple on this side of the room,
there's two of these floating globes.

1903
01:49:05,512 --> 01:49:06,985
TRAVIS: I step into the room.

1904
01:49:06,985 --> 01:49:12,426
LIAM: Okay. Coming around now you can see all the
dog beds, obviously this column and then you look

1905
01:49:12,426 --> 01:49:20,004
over to the side, and you see the office proper.
You see a large, beautiful desk. First thing you

1906
01:49:20,004 --> 01:49:25,393
see are two double doors that enter here, and then
there is a very impressive full-sized desk facing

1907
01:49:25,393 --> 01:49:29,522
that, there is a little wooden chair. Like coming
in for the interview.

1908
01:49:29,522 --> 01:49:31,497
MARY: So the desk is in the middle of the room?

1909
01:49:31,497 --> 01:49:37,278
LIAM: Yeah, if it's a long room, and coming up
here is where the dog beds are, and the column,

1910
01:49:37,278 --> 01:49:42,666
and then here's the middle with this desk, and the
entrance, and then further over this way there's

1911
01:49:42,666 --> 01:49:48,474
more. But it's a beautiful desk, and the chair,
it's like a miniature throne with little wooden

1912
01:49:48,474 --> 01:49:55,014
steps up the side of it, and you can see the seat
is higher than you would think it would be, for you

1913
01:49:55,014 --> 01:50:03,539
at least. And there's a beautiful globe in a brass
fixture on one side of the desk. On the other side

1914
01:50:03,539 --> 01:50:10,262
is a bookstand, like a bible stand if you've ever
seen one with a huge book with red ink in it and a

1915
01:50:10,262 --> 01:50:17,384
red ribbon hanging down. The binding of it looks
tan-colored, maybe leather. There's a huge table

1916
01:50:17,384 --> 01:50:21,852
on the far end of the room with papers scattered
all over it.

1917
01:50:21,852 --> 01:50:24,940
TRAVIS: Are there any windows or doors in this
room?

1918
01:50:24,940 --> 01:50:30,771
LIAM: There are two windows to your right here.
The rain is still coming down in sheets. They're

1919
01:50:30,771 --> 01:50:37,207
like ship porthole windows, circular, two of them
on the side you came up on. The rain is (crashing)

1920
01:50:37,207 --> 01:50:43,247
against the side of it, all the way across the
room. Same right behind you where you came up.

1921
01:50:43,247 --> 01:50:47,207
TRAVIS: Obby, will you come up here?

1922
01:50:47,207 --> 01:50:54,473
SAM: I come into the room and see the dog beds,
and I stop at the door.

1923
01:50:54,473 --> 01:50:57,176
TRAVIS: How do you feel about dogs?

1924
01:50:57,176 --> 01:51:00,085
SAM: Do you know why they call me Obby the Rat?

1925
01:51:00,085 --> 01:51:03,183
TRAVIS: No.

1926
01:51:03,183 --> 01:51:05,056
SAM: I hate dogs.

1927
01:51:05,056 --> 01:51:12,306
TRAVIS: Can you do me a favor and inspect those
dog beds and see what you can make of that bronze

1928
01:51:12,306 --> 01:51:13,158
column?

1929
01:51:13,158 --> 01:51:15,988
SAM: Obby would rather not, but I will for you.

1930
01:51:15,988 --> 01:51:17,883
TRAVIS: That's love, man.

1931
01:51:17,883 --> 01:51:21,708
SAM: I owe you for spilling acid. Hey, do you need
some health, or something?

1932
01:51:21,708 --> 01:51:23,410
TRAVIS: No, I'm good, why?

1933
01:51:23,410 --> 01:51:26,348
SAM: You're bleeding from your eyes.

1934
01:51:26,348 --> 01:51:30,000
TRAVIS: That's the color of my perspiration.

1935
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:35,362
SAM: I will go and inspect the dog beds, is that
what I've been commissioned to do?

1936
01:51:35,362 --> 01:51:37,853
TRAVIS: Yeah, take Delweth with you.

1937
01:51:37,853 --> 01:51:40,008
SAM: I don't need her.

1938
01:51:40,008 --> 01:51:45,171
MARY: One night, that's all, you know, after one
night--

1939
01:51:45,171 --> 01:51:49,514
SAM: What am I doing? I'm checking the dog beds
for traps.

1940
01:51:49,514 --> 01:51:51,574
LIAM: What did you roll?

1941
01:51:51,574 --> 01:51:52,809
SAM: Five.

1942
01:51:52,809 --> 01:51:58,452
LIAM: You poke at them. They're soft, comfortable,
warm, they smell mildly like pee.

1943
01:51:58,452 --> 01:52:03,100
SAM: And I will sniff around and see if I can
smell any animals.

1944
01:52:03,100 --> 01:52:08,248
LIAM: Make a nature check.

1945
01:52:08,248 --> 01:52:11,520
SAM: Ten.

1946
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:17,623
LIAM: There's dog toys sitting around here; it
does smell like dog in the room. The house is

1947
01:52:17,623 --> 01:52:20,134
quiet, other than the rain.

1948
01:52:20,134 --> 01:52:23,063
SAM: Time is of the essence, we should move.

1949
01:52:23,063 --> 01:52:25,383
TRAVIS: We should. Delweth, Dren, Devan, will you
come here?

1950
01:52:25,383 --> 01:52:26,548
ASHLY: Yes.

1951
01:52:26,548 --> 01:52:27,766
MARY: What can we do for you, Tarvis?

1952
01:52:27,766 --> 01:52:30,942
TRAVIS: Delweth, will you secure the room, and see
if there are any small dog doors that would open

1953
01:52:30,942 --> 01:52:38,304
and surprise us in a very nasty way? Will you
check the perimeter of the room? Dren and Devan,

1954
01:52:38,304 --> 01:52:41,098
shall we make our way to that lovely desk?

1955
01:52:41,098 --> 01:52:42,584
ASHLY: Yes!

1956
01:52:42,584 --> 01:52:43,693
LAURA: Sure.

1957
01:52:43,693 --> 01:52:45,528
TRAVIS: Your hesitation?

1958
01:52:45,528 --> 01:52:47,354
LAURA: I don't know why you want to check a desk.

1959
01:52:47,354 --> 01:52:48,531
TRAVIS: No?

1960
01:52:48,531 --> 01:52:53,195
LAURA: I mean, you're looking for an emerald,
right? A big fat one?

1961
01:52:53,195 --> 01:52:57,162
MARY: I do an insight check.

1962
01:52:57,162 --> 01:52:59,463
SAM: She gave you judgy face.

1963
01:52:59,463 --> 01:53:03,177
MARY: Is that what I do? I want to insight check
<i>you</i>.

1964
01:53:03,177 --> 01:53:04,317
LAURA: Me?

1965
01:53:04,317 --> 01:53:05,078
MARY: Yeah.

1966
01:53:05,078 --> 01:53:06,205
LAURA: Okay.

1967
01:53:06,205 --> 01:53:11,811
MARY: That would be a three. Do I add anything to
it?

1968
01:53:11,811 --> 01:53:14,623
TRAVIS: Yeah, you add two.

1969
01:53:14,623 --> 01:53:15,969
MARY: That would be a five.

1970
01:53:15,969 --> 01:53:19,071
LIAM: Make a roll and add your charisma bonus.

1971
01:53:19,071 --> 01:53:24,741
LAURA: I would have to roll, like, nothing,
because-- ten.

1972
01:53:24,741 --> 01:53:26,839
LIAM: Great. Clobbered. Yeah, I don't know.

1973
01:53:26,839 --> 01:53:33,040
MARY: I'm going to do a perception check on the
room to see if I find any doors, or anything else.

1974
01:53:33,040 --> 01:53:35,015
I do want to check out the bronze thing in the
center.

1975
01:53:35,015 --> 01:53:42,870
LIAM: Sure. You check out the column first. It's
beautifully made of brass. It's very ornate.

1976
01:53:42,870 --> 01:53:51,444
MARY: No holes, I can't detect anything on the
sides, no levers? Any constellations I can push

1977
01:53:51,444 --> 01:53:53,207
things into?

1978
01:53:53,207 --> 01:54:00,213
LIAM: No, you fiddle with it for a minute. It does
seem strange in the middle of a room. It doesn't

1979
01:54:00,213 --> 01:54:01,772
look like it's supporting anything.

1980
01:54:01,772 --> 01:54:04,833
MARY: And there's nothing at the top? It goes
floor to ceiling?

1981
01:54:04,833 --> 01:54:13,517
LIAM: Meets at the ceiling. In fact, it looks like
it goes into the ceiling.

1982
01:54:13,517 --> 01:54:18,647
MARY: We might want to check that if we go up
another story, see if we find it.

1983
01:54:18,647 --> 01:54:25,258
TRAVIS: And there's no balcony, riser, second
level, or anything in this room?

1984
01:54:25,258 --> 01:54:27,106
LIAM: In this room? Not in this room.

1985
01:54:27,106 --> 01:54:30,898
MARY: All right, then I check the walls for doggy
doors.

1986
01:54:30,898 --> 01:54:35,178
LIAM: Okay. You don't find dog doors. You do find
a wet bar hidden off to the side, on the other

1987
01:54:35,178 --> 01:54:44,511
side of where the-- yeah, old lady don't play. And
there's paper, you take a cursory glance at the

1988
01:54:44,511 --> 01:54:50,826
papers scattered on the large, long table, chairs
around it. There's an invitation from a Lord and

1989
01:54:50,826 --> 01:54:54,005
Lady Caldouin for a literary salon.

1990
01:54:54,005 --> 01:54:56,226
MARY: Nothing in the wet bar?

1991
01:54:56,226 --> 01:54:57,820
LIAM: Plenty in the wet bar.

1992
01:54:57,820 --> 01:55:00,394
TRAVIS: Obby, help Delweth with the wet bar.

1993
01:55:00,394 --> 01:55:02,276
SAM: Gladly.

1994
01:55:02,276 --> 01:55:03,742
MARY: What's your poison, Obby?

1995
01:55:03,742 --> 01:55:05,137
SAM: Vodka.

1996
01:55:05,137 --> 01:55:09,482
LIAM: I don't know what that is, but there's elven
wine, there's firewater.

1997
01:55:09,482 --> 01:55:12,140
MARY: I take a bottle of elven wine and put it in
my satchel.

1998
01:55:12,140 --> 01:55:14,752
SAM: Not interested.

1999
01:55:14,752 --> 01:55:18,310
LAURA: While they're looking at that, can I look
at the big book in the room?

2000
01:55:18,310 --> 01:55:20,043
LIAM: Yeah. What languages do you speak?

2001
01:55:20,043 --> 01:55:22,462
LAURA: I don't know. Halfling.

2002
01:55:22,462 --> 01:55:27,370
LIAM: You can't read it, then. It is beautiful,
but a little unsettling.

2003
01:55:27,370 --> 01:55:32,277
ASHLY: What if we busted open that pillar? Can
we?

2004
01:55:32,277 --> 01:55:34,168
SAM: It's made out of solid brass.

2005
01:55:34,168 --> 01:55:36,569
ASHLY: Is it solid brass? Is it hollow? Can we
tell that?

2006
01:55:36,569 --> 01:55:40,824
LAURA: I think the pillar probably supports the
room.

2007
01:55:40,824 --> 01:55:42,513
SAM: Was it always there?

2008
01:55:42,513 --> 01:55:47,122
ASHLY: I think he said it didn't seem like it
supports anything.

2009
01:55:47,122 --> 01:55:48,996
LIAM: You don't remember that.

2010
01:55:48,996 --> 01:55:52,198
TRAVIS: Do you want to go knock on it?

2011
01:55:52,198 --> 01:55:56,094
ASHLY: Yeah. Can I knock on it? Clunk clunk.

2012
01:55:56,094 --> 01:55:58,529
LIAM: (hollow ringing)

2013
01:55:58,529 --> 01:56:00,507
ASHLY and TRAVIS: It's hollow!

2014
01:56:00,507 --> 01:56:02,747
LIAM: The metal felt thick to the hit.

2015
01:56:02,747 --> 01:56:07,383
MARY: We could try some acid on it.

2016
01:56:07,383 --> 01:56:09,281
TRAVIS: Devan, to the desk, please.

2017
01:56:09,281 --> 01:56:11,334
LAURA: What do you want me to do?

2018
01:56:11,334 --> 01:56:12,526
TRAVIS: Search it.

2019
01:56:12,526 --> 01:56:16,862
LIAM: You go through.

2020
01:56:16,862 --> 01:56:19,627
LAURA: 18.

2021
01:56:19,627 --> 01:56:24,696
LIAM: You find more paper in there, more
parchments. There's more business in there.

2022
01:56:24,696 --> 01:56:30,732
There's more "flapjack," more "whisper."
"Tiddlywink" is a name that shows up.

2023
01:56:30,732 --> 01:56:33,459
MARY: Overbite, shortstack.

2024
01:56:33,459 --> 01:56:35,720
TRAVIS: No keys, no books, no binders?

2025
01:56:35,720 --> 01:56:37,326
SAM: Woodchuck. Gray squirrel.

2026
01:56:37,326 --> 01:56:39,119
LAURA: Are there any keys?

2027
01:56:39,119 --> 01:56:40,219
LIAM: No.

2028
01:56:40,219 --> 01:56:41,872
TRAVIS: Books or binders?

2029
01:56:41,872 --> 01:56:51,247
LIAM: There's quills, an empty journal, the
equivalent in Emon of a Farmer's Almanac talking

2030
01:56:51,247 --> 01:56:55,280
about the cycles of the moon and weather.

2031
01:56:55,280 --> 01:56:59,610
TRAVIS: An almanac? I'll take the almanac.

2032
01:56:59,610 --> 01:57:08,128
MARY: Do you remember your grandmother having any
celestial connection? She's a wizard?

2033
01:57:08,128 --> 01:57:19,117
LAURA: She's a sorcerer. Just like me! Only
stronger. Look, you guys want a jewel.

2034
01:57:19,117 --> 01:57:20,428
SAM: Where is it?

2035
01:57:20,428 --> 01:57:25,092
LAURA: You have me here. I don't why you're not
listening to me. It's going to be upstairs!

2036
01:57:25,092 --> 01:57:28,178
MARY: You stuck your hand in the thing and we had
to fight that.

2037
01:57:28,178 --> 01:57:30,547
LAURA: Yeah, but those weren't there before, you
know?

2038
01:57:30,547 --> 01:57:34,314
TRAVIS: Can I check the underside of the desk and
the chair for hidden switches?

2039
01:57:34,314 --> 01:57:36,141
LIAM: Yes, make a perception check.

2040
01:57:36,141 --> 01:57:37,981
MARY: What book was she looking at?

2041
01:57:37,981 --> 01:57:39,313
TRAVIS: 16.

2042
01:57:39,313 --> 01:57:46,230
LIAM: Big, massive book on a bible stand. You feel
under, knock on it. You know what to do in these

2043
01:57:46,230 --> 01:57:49,221
instances, you know to look for hidden catches.
You're not finding anything.

2044
01:57:49,221 --> 01:57:51,462
TRAVIS: Pick up the book.

2045
01:57:51,462 --> 01:57:53,646
LIAM: The big book? Yeah, okay.

2046
01:57:53,646 --> 01:57:55,093
MARY: What language is it, Tarvis?

2047
01:57:55,093 --> 01:57:56,734
LIAM: What languages do you speak?

2048
01:57:56,734 --> 01:57:58,222
TRAVIS: Common and Orc.

2049
01:57:58,222 --> 01:58:03,355
MARY: Elvish and Dwarven. Fuck.

2050
01:58:03,355 --> 01:58:07,346
TRAVIS: The globe is a planet globe, or is it an
orb?

2051
01:58:07,346 --> 01:58:12,687
LIAM: It's a planet globe, and you can't read
what's on that, either. You spin it around, look

2052
01:58:12,687 --> 01:58:15,768
at it for a while, you do recognize the 
coast of Emon.

2053
01:58:15,768 --> 01:58:19,085
TRAVIS: If I open up the almanac and flip through
the pages really fast, are there any markings or

2054
01:58:19,085 --> 01:58:25,706
things that are circled, or anything that might be
a cypher or codex for the letters? No.

2055
01:58:25,706 --> 01:58:28,026
ASHLY: Has anyone done a perception check on the
pillar?

2056
01:58:28,026 --> 01:58:30,728
MARY: I did investigation.

2057
01:58:30,728 --> 01:58:34,984
LIAM: Anyone can try anything, and someone could
succeed where someone else failed.

2058
01:58:34,984 --> 01:58:36,241
TRAVIS: Want to give it a whack?

2059
01:58:36,241 --> 01:58:45,703
ASHLY: Sure. Maybe I'll get a natty 20 on this
roll. Sure didn't. It's a seven.

2060
01:58:45,703 --> 01:58:50,112
LIAM: You go, "I, I, I, want the knife."

2061
01:58:50,112 --> 01:58:53,157
MARY: You knocked on it; it's hollow?

2062
01:58:53,157 --> 01:58:54,095
ASHLY: It's hollow.

2063
01:58:54,095 --> 01:59:00,134
MARY: It's hollow, all right. Do you want me to
try some acid and see if it'll melt the bronze?

2064
01:59:00,134 --> 01:59:01,487
Or we could move on.

2065
01:59:01,487 --> 01:59:06,901
TRAVIS: It doesn't seem like it may have a support
function. All right, lead the way, Devan.

2066
01:59:06,901 --> 01:59:10,221
LAURA: All right! And I walk towards the--

2067
01:59:10,221 --> 01:59:15,382
LIAM: You know how big the house is. You're on the
back side of the house. You know that through

2068
01:59:15,382 --> 01:59:19,736
those double doors is the main hallway of the
first floor. There's other rooms in the house;

2069
01:59:19,736 --> 01:59:26,313
there's a kitchen, dining room, library, and
sitting room for guests. Out at the front of the

2070
01:59:26,313 --> 01:59:30,651
house are where the twin sets of staircases are
that lead up to the second floor, to your old

2071
01:59:30,651 --> 01:59:32,508
bedroom, and to the hall.

2072
01:59:32,508 --> 01:59:39,442
LAURA: The hall. The room. Can I lead them there?

2073
01:59:39,442 --> 01:59:41,214
LIAM: Are you going to go on a little march?

2074
01:59:41,214 --> 01:59:43,148
LAURA: Should we? Do you trust me?

2075
01:59:43,148 --> 01:59:44,919
TRAVIS, SAM, and MARY: No.

2076
01:59:44,919 --> 01:59:47,922
LAURA: Do you want a jewel?

2077
01:59:47,922 --> 01:59:50,057
TRAVIS and MARY: Yeah.

2078
01:59:50,057 --> 01:59:56,165
MARY: Let's go to the doors. I inspect the doors
to see if there any traps and go stealth.

2079
01:59:56,165 --> 02:00:00,457
LIAM: Make a perception check.

2080
02:00:00,457 --> 02:00:06,017
MARY: That's better. 15.

2081
02:00:06,017 --> 02:00:11,981
LIAM: You trace your fingers lightly along the
edges of the door, look for the telltale signs

2082
02:00:11,981 --> 02:00:14,985
that you all have trained to find. You don't see
anything.

2083
02:00:14,985 --> 02:00:18,393
MARY: Is the door unlocked?

2084
02:00:18,393 --> 02:00:19,506
LIAM: Yes.

2085
02:00:19,506 --> 02:00:22,585
MARY: I use Mage Hand to open the door very
slowly, just the right side.

2086
02:00:22,585 --> 02:00:28,911
LIAM: You're looking in. The only light is coming
from this room, but a dark long hallway that

2087
02:00:28,911 --> 02:00:30,744
stretches about 80 feet.

2088
02:00:30,744 --> 02:00:32,380
MARY: How far does my darkvision reach?

2089
02:00:32,380 --> 02:00:34,110
LIAM: 60ish.

2090
02:00:34,110 --> 02:00:35,867
MARY: I see nothing within 60 feet?

2091
02:00:35,867 --> 02:00:40,799
LIAM: No, you see some potted plants and a nice
red carpet disappearing a little bit into the

2092
02:00:40,799 --> 02:00:42,053
darkness.

2093
02:00:42,053 --> 02:00:43,476
LAURA: Do you hear dogs?

2094
02:00:43,476 --> 02:00:46,946
MARY: I don't hear any dogs, no.

2095
02:00:46,946 --> 02:00:48,801
ASHLY: Is this the hallway you were talking
about?

2096
02:00:48,801 --> 02:00:51,859
LAURA: No. This is a hall, though.

2097
02:00:51,859 --> 02:00:55,405
ASHLY: That's true! Should we walk down it?

2098
02:00:55,405 --> 02:01:03,971
MARY: I'll go in the lead this time. Again with my
rapier out. Is that all right with you, Tarvis, if

2099
02:01:03,971 --> 02:01:05,246
I take the lead in this?

2100
02:01:05,246 --> 02:01:06,367
TRAVIS: Please, yes.

2101
02:01:06,367 --> 02:01:08,621
LAURA: Do you want me to send some lights down the
hallway?

2102
02:01:08,621 --> 02:01:10,330
MARY: Not right now.

2103
02:01:10,330 --> 02:01:15,449
SAM: I will take the rear. I do not like dogs.

2104
02:01:15,449 --> 02:01:21,239
LIAM: So you guys slowly creep your way down.
Everybody make a stealth check.

2105
02:01:21,239 --> 02:01:23,741
SAM: Two.

2106
02:01:23,741 --> 02:01:25,046
LIAM: Really?

2107
02:01:25,046 --> 02:01:26,428
ASHLY: 24.

2108
02:01:26,428 --> 02:01:27,484
TRAVIS: 19.

2109
02:01:27,484 --> 02:01:28,559
SAM: Seven.

2110
02:01:28,559 --> 02:01:29,931
MARY: 14.

2111
02:01:29,931 --> 02:01:30,778
ASHLY: 24.

2112
02:01:30,778 --> 02:01:32,231
LAURA: 19.

2113
02:01:32,231 --> 02:01:37,196
LIAM: You quietly move your way down, this one
bumps a potted plant on the way--

2114
02:01:37,196 --> 02:01:38,966
SAM: Is that dog?

2115
02:01:38,966 --> 02:01:47,964
LIAM: Everybody holds still for a second. Nothing.
You continue on, you eventually meet another set

2116
02:01:47,964 --> 02:01:52,043
of doors, just like the ones you went through. You
know this leads to the front of the house.

2117
02:01:52,043 --> 02:01:56,627
MARY: What's through there?

2118
02:01:56,627 --> 02:01:58,201
LAURA: The foyer.

2119
02:01:58,201 --> 02:02:05,905
MARY: Again, I'll take Mage Hand and go along the
edge of the door, checking for traps--

2120
02:02:05,905 --> 02:02:09,519
LIAM: Make a perception check.

2121
02:02:09,519 --> 02:02:15,849
MARY: Perception. 18.

2122
02:02:15,849 --> 02:02:21,658
LIAM: Tickle the door open with this spectral
hand, sticks its pinkie into the keyhole. Seems

2123
02:02:21,658 --> 02:02:24,719
fine, nothing's happening.

2124
02:02:24,719 --> 02:02:29,975
MARY: Tarvis, it seems like the door's clear. What
do you want me to do?

2125
02:02:29,975 --> 02:02:32,078
TRAVIS: Be my guest.

2126
02:02:32,078 --> 02:02:37,659
MARY: Again, I use Mage Hand on the right door, if
there are two, is it two or one?

2127
02:02:37,659 --> 02:02:45,245
LIAM: It's two. You see the red carpet actually
continues into the next room, and you can barely

2128
02:02:45,245 --> 02:02:53,103
see two sets of stairways coming down along the
sides of this path and this carpet. You can see a

2129
02:02:53,103 --> 02:03:03,817
very beautiful set of large doors with circular
windows, one on each side, and you see the rain

2130
02:03:03,817 --> 02:03:11,483
coming down. You also can make out a person at a
distance walking by--

2131
02:03:11,483 --> 02:03:12,639
SAM: Outside?

2132
02:03:12,639 --> 02:03:14,078
LIAM: About ten or 15 feet, yeah.

2133
02:03:14,078 --> 02:03:15,702
MARY: Is there someone outside?

2134
02:03:15,702 --> 02:03:20,292
LIAM: You see a coat tree right by the door, and
then a little table to the other side of it with a

2135
02:03:20,292 --> 02:03:22,465
pair of white gloves sitting on it.

2136
02:03:22,465 --> 02:03:24,108
LAURA: (whispering) Do you hear any dogs?

2137
02:03:24,108 --> 02:03:26,743
MARY: I hear no dogs.

2138
02:03:26,743 --> 02:03:29,721
LIAM: Painting of some old halfling man with a
curly little moustache-

2139
02:03:29,721 --> 02:03:31,450
TRAVIS: Obby, check the painting.

2140
02:03:31,450 --> 02:03:37,072
SAM: Behind the painting? (groans) I hate art.

2141
02:03:37,072 --> 02:03:41,819
LIAM: Do you know why the call me Obby the Rat?

2142
02:03:41,819 --> 02:03:43,432
SAM: I look behind the painting.

2143
02:03:43,432 --> 02:03:44,857
LIAM: There's nothing there.

2144
02:03:44,857 --> 02:03:48,850
SAM: There's a man looking through the eyeholes of
the painting.

2145
02:03:48,850 --> 02:03:50,786
TRAVIS: Did you kill him?

2146
02:03:50,786 --> 02:03:53,133
SAM: No, he seemed okay.

2147
02:03:53,133 --> 02:03:55,515
TRAVIS: I trust your judgment.

2148
02:03:55,515 --> 02:04:00,496
MARY: So no doors, no nothing? It's two stairways
going up and two big doors, but what's on the

2149
02:04:00,496 --> 02:04:01,636
right and left?

2150
02:04:01,636 --> 02:04:08,342
LIAM: You were so fixated on the guy outside.
There's a door on the side of this room, and on

2151
02:04:08,342 --> 02:04:11,693
the other side as well. There's stairs leading up
to it.

2152
02:04:11,693 --> 02:04:13,857
ASHLY: Do you know who that guy would be, Devan?

2153
02:04:13,857 --> 02:04:15,631
LAURA: I don't know, probably a guard.

2154
02:04:15,631 --> 02:04:19,129
MARY: Devan, give us a layout. What's on the
right, on the left, up?

2155
02:04:19,129 --> 02:04:23,844
SAM: Come on, off the top of your head! 
Quick! Quick!

2156
02:04:23,844 --> 02:04:26,414
LAURA: It's been ten years.

2157
02:04:26,414 --> 02:04:28,408
LIAM: There's a library on the right.

2158
02:04:28,408 --> 02:04:35,641
LAURA: There's a library on the right. And then on
the left is a little sitting area. And then

2159
02:04:35,641 --> 02:04:40,179
upstairs-- It's been a while. So unless she
rearranged, upstairs--

2160
02:04:40,179 --> 02:04:42,062
MARY: You lived here as a child, yeah?

2161
02:04:42,062 --> 02:04:51,822
LAURA: No. My mom, she split. My grandma took me
in. She was a horrible person though.

2162
02:04:51,822 --> 02:04:53,878
MARY: How long did you live here for?

2163
02:04:53,878 --> 02:04:55,607
LAURA: Couple years.

2164
02:04:55,607 --> 02:04:59,796
SAM: Devan? Family is very important.

2165
02:04:59,796 --> 02:05:01,089
LAURA: I know.

2166
02:05:01,089 --> 02:05:02,834
SAM: You should not have stolen from yours.

2167
02:05:02,834 --> 02:05:07,482
LAURA: She doesn't even pay attention to how much
is down there! It's ridiculous!

2168
02:05:07,482 --> 02:05:09,626
SAM: If you want attention there's other ways of
finding it.

2169
02:05:09,626 --> 02:05:13,469
LAURA: Thank you.

2170
02:05:13,469 --> 02:05:15,702
ASHLY: Is that a come on, or are we--?

2171
02:05:15,702 --> 02:05:17,488
TRAVIS: Do you have a haiku for this, Dren?

2172
02:05:17,488 --> 02:05:23,968
LAURA: Is her bedroom upstairs?

2173
02:05:23,968 --> 02:05:28,650
LIAM: Her bedroom is on the third floor. <i>Your</i>
bedroom is on the second floor.

2174
02:05:28,650 --> 02:05:31,361
LAURA: Okay. So my bedroom used to--

2175
02:05:31,361 --> 02:05:34,003
LIAM: There's a guest bedroom up there too, and
the funtime hall is up there as well.

2176
02:05:34,003 --> 02:05:39,604
LAURA: And then there's this room. I mean, it
could be in there. I'm thinking it's probably in

2177
02:05:39,604 --> 02:05:45,358
there, because there was this cabinet that I never
got to look in. I feel like that's where it would be.

2178
02:05:45,358 --> 02:05:46,804
TRAVIS: In which room?

2179
02:05:46,804 --> 02:05:50,791
LAURA: In the funroom. Then upstairs from that is
my grandma's bedroom, which I guess it could be in

2180
02:05:50,791 --> 02:05:51,921
there as well.

2181
02:05:51,921 --> 02:05:55,042
TRAVIS: This might be a strange question. Why is
it called the funroom?

2182
02:05:55,042 --> 02:05:57,899
LAURA: Oh, because that's where she keeps all
her magic stuff.

2183
02:05:57,899 --> 02:05:59,206
MARY: Let's go there.

2184
02:05:59,206 --> 02:06:01,662
TRAVIS: Her magic stuff.

2185
02:06:01,662 --> 02:06:05,188
ASHLY: There's not a situation-- forgive me,
Tarvis-- where we should split up and look at

2186
02:06:05,188 --> 02:06:07,052
different places?

2187
02:06:07,052 --> 02:06:12,048
TRAVIS: I wouldn't mind that. Do we want to check
out the rooms on the right and the left super fast?

2188
02:06:12,048 --> 02:06:16,492
SAM: You're the boss, boss.

2189
02:06:16,492 --> 02:06:18,203
MARY: We'll do whatever you say, Tarvis.

2190
02:06:18,203 --> 02:06:20,923
TRAVIS: I'll move to the door where the guard
keeps walking outside and crouch underneath one of

2191
02:06:20,923 --> 02:06:31,382
the windows. If he comes in, he's dead. And I'll
let Delweth go with Devan, and Dren goes with

2192
02:06:31,382 --> 02:06:32,437
Obby.

2193
02:06:32,437 --> 02:06:34,727
LAURA: Where are we going?

2194
02:06:34,727 --> 02:06:38,023
TRAVIS: One can check out the library and one can
check out the tea room.

2195
02:06:38,023 --> 02:06:39,743
LIAM: All right, who's going to the library, to
the right?

2196
02:06:39,743 --> 02:06:41,754
SAM: Me and Dren are going to the library.

2197
02:06:41,754 --> 02:06:44,728
LIAM: Okay. All right, you head in there. First of
all, you, Tarvis, look out the window. It's not a

2198
02:06:44,728 --> 02:06:51,256
man. It's a woman. It's a large woman, with shock
white hair and massive arms.

2199
02:06:51,256 --> 02:06:53,685
TRAVIS: Armed? She'll die.

2200
02:06:53,685 --> 02:06:55,520
MARY: She's got massive arms?

2201
02:06:55,520 --> 02:07:01,468
LIAM: Yeah. Well she's got a cloak with a hood,
and you can see the hair spilling out. She looked

2202
02:07:01,468 --> 02:07:04,459
right at the house a moment ago, but she didn't
look at you. She just glanced over--

2203
02:07:04,459 --> 02:07:07,938
TRAVIS: Does it look like she's standing sentry
and doing a guardsman?

2204
02:07:07,938 --> 02:07:15,750
LIAM: Yeah, and you can even see further in the
distance, like another 60 feet away is a gate to

2205
02:07:15,750 --> 02:07:21,494
the rest of the city, out of her grounds. You can
barely, in this heavy rain, see two more guys,

2206
02:07:21,494 --> 02:07:24,678
standing on the other side.

2207
02:07:24,678 --> 02:07:27,649
TRAVIS: Be quick about it. Search, come back, and
let's move on.

2208
02:07:27,649 --> 02:07:31,735
LIAM: So you guys split off to the library?

2209
02:07:31,735 --> 02:07:32,852
SAM: Yes.

2210
02:07:32,852 --> 02:07:40,048
LIAM: You can see in here. It's totally dark, but
bookshelves curve all the way around the entirety

2211
02:07:40,048 --> 02:07:45,533
of this room. There's one of those rolling ladders
that slides along to reach the books on the top

2212
02:07:45,533 --> 02:07:53,243
shelf. There's a nice loveseat with a small side
table next to it. There's a book, open, upside

2213
02:07:53,243 --> 02:07:54,821
down, on the table.

2214
02:07:54,821 --> 02:08:05,283
SAM: I'll do a perception check to see if there is
anything out of the ordinary or weird? 18.

2215
02:08:05,283 --> 02:08:15,326
LIAM: You do notice wedged amongst all the books
of history, philosophy, and arcana one erotic

2216
02:08:15,326 --> 02:08:17,616
novel.

2217
02:08:17,616 --> 02:08:26,305
SAM: I pick it up. I give it to Dren. And I say:
maybe you can use this, not for me.

2218
02:08:26,305 --> 02:08:32,231
ASHLY: I don't know what you're talking about.
Thank you.

2219
02:08:32,231 --> 02:08:35,493
LIAM: Meanwhile, in the tea room, it is also
really dark in here. It's you two?

2220
02:08:35,493 --> 02:08:36,615
LAURA: Yeah.

2221
02:08:36,615 --> 02:08:41,924
LIAM: You can't see shit, but you can see a
beautiful little round table with a china set out,

2222
02:08:41,924 --> 02:08:47,935
white and blue plates. It's hard to see that in
the dark. It looks more like white and black.

2223
02:08:47,935 --> 02:08:56,775
There's a little rolling tea table with sugar bowl
and all the stuff. There's also, what's the word?

2224
02:08:56,775 --> 02:08:58,495
Not an armoire--

2225
02:08:58,495 --> 02:08:59,542
MARY: A buffet?

2226
02:08:59,542 --> 02:09:05,538
LIAM: That's what it is! A buffet with a couple of
silver platters placed neatly for presentational

2227
02:09:05,538 --> 02:09:09,357
purpose. Looks like a presenting room or sitting
room.

2228
02:09:09,357 --> 02:09:12,537
LAURA: Delweth, do you want me to cast some
dazzling lights?

2229
02:09:12,633 --> 02:09:20,321
MARY: You know what, let's leave it for now. Save
it. Let's look around. I mean, you can't look

2230
02:09:20,321 --> 02:09:21,462
around.

2231
02:09:21,462 --> 02:09:23,690
LIAM: You hear a woman's voice sneeze outside the
window.

2232
02:09:23,690 --> 02:09:25,328
MARY: Quiet.

2233
02:09:25,328 --> 02:09:28,000
SAM and LAURA: What?

2234
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:31,609
MARY: Outside one of the porthole windows?

2235
02:09:31,609 --> 02:09:37,940
LIAM: Yeah, not right outside it, a little ways
away. Through the heavy sound of the rain.

2236
02:09:37,940 --> 02:09:41,794
MARY: Can I approach the window very stealthily?

2237
02:09:41,794 --> 02:09:43,408
LIAM: The one in here? Sure.

2238
02:09:43,408 --> 02:09:45,197
MARY: And take a little peek out.

2239
02:09:45,197 --> 02:09:50,091
LAURA: Here's the thing, Delweth. I don't know why
we're not friends. I mean, I didn't really do

2240
02:09:50,091 --> 02:09:53,205
anything to hurt the Clasp. In fact, I'm just
helping you guys!

2241
02:09:53,205 --> 02:09:57,852
MARY: Devan, I understand that you might have a
problem with gambling.

2242
02:09:57,852 --> 02:10:02,150
LAURA: I mean, that's pretty innocent, really.

2243
02:10:02,150 --> 02:10:06,196
MARY: I know a lot about addiction.

2244
02:10:06,196 --> 02:10:07,913
LAURA: Oh, really?

2245
02:10:07,913 --> 02:10:09,877
SAM: Sex-a-holic.

2246
02:10:09,877 --> 02:10:13,618
ASHLY: I have a book for you later.

2247
02:10:13,618 --> 02:10:23,456
MARY: So, as much as I'd like to, it's difficult
for me to trust you.

2248
02:10:23,456 --> 02:10:24,554
LAURA: Right.

2249
02:10:24,554 --> 02:10:25,872
MARY: But I think if we both get out of this--

2250
02:10:25,872 --> 02:10:26,908
LAURA: I think we will!

2251
02:10:26,908 --> 02:10:28,556
MARY: I think we'll be fine. All right?

2252
02:10:28,556 --> 02:10:29,736
LAURA: We'll be friends afterwards.

2253
02:10:29,736 --> 02:10:34,711
MARY: So here's the thing. I know what you're
going through. I'm going to do whatever I can to

2254
02:10:34,711 --> 02:10:38,839
help you. All right? But that's between us.

2255
02:10:38,839 --> 02:10:42,114
LAURA: Okay.

2256
02:10:42,114 --> 02:10:46,697
SAM: Audience, she said that she's going to do
whatever she can to help you.

2257
02:10:46,697 --> 02:10:50,230
MARY: Let's go back out. I think. Are there any
drawers on the buffet?

2258
02:10:50,230 --> 02:10:56,747
LIAM: Sure there are. There's silverware, napkins,
really nice napkins, and tablecloths.

2259
02:10:56,747 --> 02:11:06,881
MARY: Any turkey carving knives or anything nice
like that? Turkey carving knife. Might need it for

2260
02:11:06,881 --> 02:11:08,605
later. You never know!

2261
02:11:08,605 --> 02:11:11,445
LIAM: You all have your weapons, so I'm going to
say you guys took a couple minutes earlier to yank

2262
02:11:11,445 --> 02:11:13,731
them out of the monstrosity downstairs.

2263
02:11:13,731 --> 02:11:17,224
SAM: We rejoin the group.

2264
02:11:17,224 --> 02:11:19,624
MARY: Stay close to me. This is going to get
dangerous.

2265
02:11:19,624 --> 02:11:23,258
TRAVIS: Anything?

2266
02:11:23,258 --> 02:11:25,444
SAM: Well there was--

2267
02:11:25,444 --> 02:11:29,345
ASHLY: Nothing! There was nothing.

2268
02:11:29,345 --> 02:11:35,690
SAM: There was a ladder on wheels that could be
the source of farcical comedy and hijinks. But not

2269
02:11:35,690 --> 02:11:37,188
tonight.

2270
02:11:37,188 --> 02:11:39,338
TRAVIS: And you two?

2271
02:11:39,338 --> 02:11:43,315
MARY: There was nothing. I heard someone sneeze
outside. It might be even the same person that was

2272
02:11:43,315 --> 02:11:46,324
walking in the front. But nothing.

2273
02:11:46,324 --> 02:11:48,377
TRAVIS: I quickly check the window to make sure
she still has her back to us.

2274
02:11:48,377 --> 02:11:50,888
LIAM: Yes, she's picking her nose quite vigorously
right now.

2275
02:11:50,888 --> 02:11:53,563
TRAVIS: We make our way to the stairs that lead to
the second floor.

2276
02:11:53,563 --> 02:11:55,406
MARY: There are two sets. Which one do you want to
go up?

2277
02:11:55,406 --> 02:11:57,843
LAURA: They go to the same place.

2278
02:11:57,843 --> 02:12:02,623
LIAM: They're identical, they're twin stairs going
to the same destination. You can tell even from

2279
02:12:02,623 --> 02:12:03,729
down here.

2280
02:12:03,729 --> 02:12:05,289
TRAVIS: The one on the right.

2281
02:12:05,289 --> 02:12:09,923
LIAM: You head up those stairs. I'll say you
quietly move your way up.

2282
02:12:09,923 --> 02:12:12,191
TRAVIS: Yeah, we would like to stealth.

2283
02:12:12,191 --> 02:12:15,820
LIAM: Roll it.

2284
02:12:15,820 --> 02:12:20,625
TRAVIS: 17.

2285
02:12:20,625 --> 02:12:22,065
LAURA: (groans) 13.

2286
02:12:22,065 --> 02:12:23,350
MARY: 24.

2287
02:12:23,350 --> 02:12:25,494
SAM: How about a natural 20?

2288
02:12:25,494 --> 02:12:27,101
MARY: That's two and two!

2289
02:12:27,101 --> 02:12:28,452
ASHLY: Wait, was that stealth?

2290
02:12:28,452 --> 02:12:30,240
LAURA: Yeah. Is that seven?

2291
02:12:30,240 --> 02:12:31,398
ASHLY: That's seven. Nine.

2292
02:12:31,398 --> 02:12:37,775
LIAM: Obby actually slips under Tarvis' legs and
then disappears through his cloak, and everyone

2293
02:12:37,775 --> 02:12:41,980
loses track for a second. He's gone.

2294
02:12:41,980 --> 02:12:43,985
TRAVIS: I got the whiff of some number twos.

2295
02:12:43,985 --> 02:12:50,242
LIAM: You move up those stairs. Directly in front
of you guys, you see doors that you recognize.

2296
02:12:50,242 --> 02:12:56,898
They're the doors to the hall. You also know that
right over here, over your shoulder, is your old

2297
02:12:56,898 --> 02:12:59,233
room. There's a guest bedroom across the hall.

2298
02:12:59,233 --> 02:13:02,528
MARY: Sorry, so I can get a layout, how many
doors?

2299
02:13:02,528 --> 02:13:07,812
LIAM: Coming up the stairs, you see double doors
right in front of you. And then, you look over

2300
02:13:07,812 --> 02:13:10,224
your shoulders, there's doors on the sides and
behind you.

2301
02:13:10,224 --> 02:13:15,644
SAM: It's got to be the double doors, right?

2302
02:13:15,644 --> 02:13:18,320
MARY: Where are we? What's ahead of us?

2303
02:13:18,320 --> 02:13:20,009
LAURA: This is the magic room.

2304
02:13:20,009 --> 02:13:20,922
MARY: Straight ahead?

2305
02:13:20,922 --> 02:13:23,601
LAURA: Upstairs is my grandma's room.

2306
02:13:23,601 --> 02:13:24,604
MARY: Where's your room?

2307
02:13:24,604 --> 02:13:27,385
LIAM: Yeah, and there's a curving stairway
directly behind you guys that goes to the third

2308
02:13:27,385 --> 02:13:28,144
floor.

2309
02:13:28,144 --> 02:13:29,531
TRAVIS: No interest in your room?

2310
02:13:29,531 --> 02:13:31,527
LAURA: She wouldn't have kept anything of mine.

2311
02:13:31,527 --> 02:13:33,688
TRAVIS: Shouldn't we visit it for nostalgia?

2312
02:13:33,688 --> 02:13:37,302
LAURA: I don't have anything in there. She
probably burned it all.

2313
02:13:37,302 --> 02:13:39,351
TRAVIS: Let's take a look.

2314
02:13:39,351 --> 02:13:53,626
MARY: How close were you at your closest to your
grandma? When she took you in, did she bounce you

2315
02:13:53,626 --> 02:13:54,803
on her knee?

2316
02:13:54,803 --> 02:13:58,315
LAURA: No, no, no. I would say I was one step down
from the cook?

2317
02:13:58,315 --> 02:14:01,826
MARY: So she didn't teach you anything?

2318
02:14:01,826 --> 02:14:06,962
LAURA: No-- I mean she taught me some spells, and
I do Dancing Lights, see? Just this is one. I take

2319
02:14:06,962 --> 02:14:10,979
it away. She taught me some stuff.

2320
02:14:10,979 --> 02:14:14,082
TRAVIS: Let's see your room.

2321
02:14:14,082 --> 02:14:15,432
MARY: Yeah.

2322
02:14:15,432 --> 02:14:19,142
LIAM: Are you taking them over to your room?

2323
02:14:19,142 --> 02:14:21,901
LAURA: I take them over to the room. There's
nothing in here!

2324
02:14:21,901 --> 02:14:26,306
LIAM: You open the door. You can't see into the
dark. But you guys, looking in in the dim light,

2325
02:14:26,306 --> 02:14:34,486
see nothing in this room except for furniture
grouped together with sheets over it for storage.

2326
02:14:34,486 --> 02:14:38,295
SAM: It's an old Backstreet Boys poster.

2327
02:14:38,295 --> 02:14:42,173
LAURA: *NSync, thank you very much!

2328
02:14:42,173 --> 02:14:50,511
TRAVIS: I reach up and take the cloth that's
hanging over a large portion of the furniture and

2329
02:14:50,511 --> 02:14:52,061
I pull it off.

2330
02:14:52,061 --> 02:15:01,139
LIAM: There is a chaise lounge with two beautiful
wooden chairs sitting on top of it. Not bedroom

2331
02:15:01,139 --> 02:15:02,587
furniture at all.

2332
02:15:02,587 --> 02:15:06,125
MARY: Nothing else, just three pieces of
furniture?

2333
02:15:06,125 --> 02:15:07,555
LIAM: Under that sheet, yeah.

2334
02:15:07,555 --> 02:15:08,533
MARY: Any other sheets?

2335
02:15:08,533 --> 02:15:09,619
LIAM: Two more.

2336
02:15:09,619 --> 02:15:11,129
MARY: All right. I pull off the second one.

2337
02:15:11,129 --> 02:15:12,436
LIAM: Oh my god!

2338
02:15:12,436 --> 02:15:13,784
MARY: Oh my god, and you die.

2339
02:15:13,784 --> 02:15:20,975
LIAM: A large table, and on top of the table,
lying on its side, is a little dresser drawer.

2340
02:15:20,975 --> 02:15:24,474
MARY: Dresser drawers. I investigate the dresser
drawers.

2341
02:15:24,474 --> 02:15:28,513
LIAM: You lift one drawer up, and it's empty.

2342
02:15:28,513 --> 02:15:30,094
MARY: There's only one drawer?

2343
02:15:30,094 --> 02:15:31,604
LIAM: You'd say it was shoved in here for
storage.

2344
02:15:31,604 --> 02:15:35,390
LAURA: I send a message over to Dren. How are you
doing? I mean, are you okay?

2345
02:15:35,390 --> 02:15:37,759
ASHLY: Yeah, I miss hanging out with you.

2346
02:15:37,759 --> 02:15:39,505
LAURA: I know, I feel like we don't even get to
talk any more.

2347
02:15:39,505 --> 02:15:42,506
ASHLY: I know, it's really dumb. It's nice being
in your room, though!

2348
02:15:42,506 --> 02:15:45,472
LAURA: Oh, well, it's kind of embarrassing.

2349
02:15:45,472 --> 02:15:48,079
(laughter)

2350
02:15:48,079 --> 02:15:51,167
TRAVIS: We take the last tarp and pull it off.

2351
02:15:51,167 --> 02:15:57,933
LIAM: It is another love seat like the one that
you saw down in the library. It's identical,

2352
02:15:57,933 --> 02:15:59,215
actually.

2353
02:15:59,215 --> 02:16:02,437
TRAVIS: I take a dagger out and shove it in the
cushions of the love seat and drag it across, open

2354
02:16:02,437 --> 02:16:03,549
it up.

2355
02:16:03,549 --> 02:16:04,981
LIAM: Stuffing pops out.

2356
02:16:04,981 --> 02:16:07,261
LAURA: No need for violence.

2357
02:16:07,261 --> 02:16:10,692
TRAVIS: Those dogs get all over the place and ruin
shit all the time.

2358
02:16:10,692 --> 02:16:12,681
SAM: Dogs? What dogs?

2359
02:16:12,681 --> 02:16:18,372
MARY: I know every child's got a secret hiding
place in their room. So I want to perception check

2360
02:16:18,372 --> 02:16:24,250
the room, the walls, if there's something, or the
floors if there's a loose floorboard, somewhere.

2361
02:16:24,250 --> 02:16:26,963
LIAM: Do the roll.

2362
02:16:26,963 --> 02:16:31,742
SAM: I pick up two playing cards, one with Corey
Feldman and one with Corey Haim.

2363
02:16:31,742 --> 02:16:40,654
LIAM: It's empty. The room, the furniture wasn't
even taking up that much space in here. It looks

2364
02:16:40,654 --> 02:16:43,772
like Grandma cleared it out, and started storing
shit in here.

2365
02:16:43,772 --> 02:16:45,695
LAURA: She does not give a shit.

2366
02:16:45,695 --> 02:16:46,893
TRAVIS: All right, fine.

2367
02:16:46,893 --> 02:16:48,612
MARY: Uno. Perception.

2368
02:16:48,612 --> 02:16:49,696
LIAM: Ghosts, there's ghosts everywhere.

2369
02:16:49,696 --> 02:16:52,501
TRAVIS: We'll leave this room, now. It's just a
hallway and the funroom door?

2370
02:16:52,501 --> 02:16:56,123
SAM: There's stairs going up.

2371
02:16:56,123 --> 02:17:02,682
TRAVIS: Yeah, up to her place. But on this floor
is the funroom. You know what?

2372
02:17:02,682 --> 02:17:07,425
MARY: Are there three other doors and the funroom?
Or one other and the funroom?

2373
02:17:07,425 --> 02:17:09,965
LAURA: Just a guest room and then the funroom.

2374
02:17:09,965 --> 02:17:14,683
TRAVIS: I don't know if you can control yourself
in the funroom, so I'm going to take the rope that

2375
02:17:14,683 --> 02:17:18,728
I have, and I'm going to bind your hands behind
your back before we go into the funroom.

2376
02:17:18,728 --> 02:17:22,553
LAURA: Oh, that's pointless because I'm going to
need my hands. If you want to get through the

2377
02:17:22,553 --> 02:17:25,194
funroom, I'm going to need my hands!

2378
02:17:25,194 --> 02:17:28,563
ASHLY: I can watch her, Tarvis. I'll make sure she
doesn't do anything--

2379
02:17:28,563 --> 02:17:31,535
TRAVIS: Oh, Dren, you said you wanted to tie her
hands behind her back for me?

2380
02:17:31,535 --> 02:17:37,894
ASHLY: Yeah, Tarvis, that's what I said, sure. And
I tie it, but really loose, but they don't see

2381
02:17:37,894 --> 02:17:39,195
that, maybe?

2382
02:17:39,195 --> 02:17:40,658
LIAM: Make a stealth check.

2383
02:17:40,658 --> 02:17:43,313
ASHLY: Fuck! Ten.

2384
02:17:43,313 --> 02:17:47,318
LIAM: Okay. Yeah, you walk behind her and tie it.

2385
02:17:47,318 --> 02:17:50,755
TRAVIS: That looks a little loose. Tighten it up
for me?

2386
02:17:50,755 --> 02:17:54,164
ASHLY: Sure, Tarvis, I'll tighten it up.

2387
02:17:54,164 --> 02:17:57,547
LAURA: Ow! That really hurt!

2388
02:17:57,547 --> 02:17:58,989
ASHLY: I'm sorry.

2389
02:17:58,989 --> 02:18:03,534
LIAM: I'll actually say it's slightly above medium
tight, because he couldn't see. Okay, what's up,

2390
02:18:03,534 --> 02:18:04,523
guys?

2391
02:18:04,523 --> 02:18:07,186
SAM: We're going into this magic room, is that
right?

2392
02:18:07,186 --> 02:18:10,820
MARY: Mage Hand the door, Mage Hand the lock, to
perceive if it's open or go along the edge.

2393
02:18:10,820 --> 02:18:17,925
LIAM: You twiddle your hand, your Mage Hand, all
over it. You spend a minute doing it, because

2394
02:18:17,925 --> 02:18:21,952
you're feeling nervous. Seems okay. You're
thorough.

2395
02:18:21,952 --> 02:18:23,506
MARY: Is it unlocked? Could I perceive if it was
unlocked?

2396
02:18:23,506 --> 02:18:25,303
LIAM: It's not locked.

2397
02:18:25,303 --> 02:18:30,660
TRAVIS: In this hallway and outside of the doors,
are there any of those sigils?

2398
02:18:30,660 --> 02:18:32,347
LIAM: No.

2399
02:18:32,347 --> 02:18:34,207
TRAVIS: Okay.

2400
02:18:34,207 --> 02:18:36,629
MARY: No rats anywhere, except for Obby?

2401
02:18:36,629 --> 02:18:43,189
TRAVIS: Does the doorknob look different than a
normal doorknob?

2402
02:18:43,189 --> 02:18:44,695
LIAM: It's not a knob. It's one of those--

2403
02:18:44,695 --> 02:18:45,966
TRAVIS: The levers?

2404
02:18:45,966 --> 02:18:47,702
MARY: Shall I Mage Hand the door?

2405
02:18:47,702 --> 02:18:50,424
TRAVIS: No, I got it. I'll open the door. And I
push it open.

2406
02:18:50,424 --> 02:19:00,703
LIAM: The door swings open in front of you and
that's where we'll take our break.

2407
02:19:00,703 --> 02:29:41,663
[break]

2408
02:29:41,663 --> 02:29:42,780
LIAM: Welcome back.

2409
02:29:42,780 --> 02:29:43,901
MARY: Balls!

2410
02:29:43,901 --> 02:29:45,132
LAURA: Too late. Way late.

2411
02:29:45,132 --> 02:29:48,860
LIAM: I hope you're all having fun inside my house
of horrors!

2412
02:29:48,860 --> 02:29:50,557
TRAVIS: We don't know what the fuck is happening.

2413
02:29:50,557 --> 02:30:01,527
LIAM: Well let's get back into it. As you open the
doors before you, you are met with quite a sight.

2414
02:30:01,527 --> 02:30:11,287
The hall is well-lit by the same amber baubles
floating in space all down the hallway. Stretches

2415
02:30:11,287 --> 02:30:20,722
out about 80, 90 feet ahead of you. The hallway is
absolutely littered with countless strange,

2416
02:30:20,722 --> 02:30:29,683
extraordinary, and occasionally off-putting
objects. This is Taliesin Jaffe's wet dream.

2417
02:30:29,683 --> 02:30:37,053
Objects of beauty and horror are mixed together in
a crazed jumble along each side of this hall.

2418
02:30:37,053 --> 02:30:42,752
There are paintings hanging all the way down, each
more unsettling than the one before. A large fish

2419
02:30:42,752 --> 02:30:49,172
skeleton hangs way down on the other end of the
hall. It looks about fifteen feet long. Things

2420
02:30:49,172 --> 02:30:56,761
right nearby that you spot: there are a crude pair
of heavy black iron tongs; a unicorn fetus in a

2421
02:30:56,761 --> 02:31:05,363
very large jar, pickled and curled in on itself; a
set of eerie looking dolls, beautifully crafted

2422
02:31:05,363 --> 02:31:11,118
but with no eyes, the front plate smashed in;
stacks of books everywhere; a large stuffed bear

2423
02:31:11,118 --> 02:31:19,670
rearing back, with a giant open snarl. Then all
the way down the hall, you see ornate, gothic,

2424
02:31:19,670 --> 02:31:29,230
creepy as fuck looking chandeliers. Three of them,
evenly spaced down the hall and they look like

2425
02:31:29,230 --> 02:31:38,654
cruel teeth pointed downward but they are
gorgeous. They're stunning to look at. You almost

2426
02:31:38,654 --> 02:31:43,897
don't know whether to shit or go blind. You don't
know where to look; there's so much stuff. And

2427
02:31:43,897 --> 02:31:48,235
you've seen this before. Most of it. There's new
things here. Things you haven't seen, and you're

2428
02:31:48,235 --> 02:31:52,732
overwhelmed, you're short-circuiting with all the
things you're looking at around you.

2429
02:31:52,732 --> 02:31:56,838
MARY: Devan, what do you remember?

2430
02:31:56,838 --> 02:32:00,599
LAURA: I remember.

2431
02:32:00,599 --> 02:32:03,131
MARY: Close your eyes, what do you remember?

2432
02:32:03,131 --> 02:32:04,717
TRAVIS: Do you remember?

2433
02:32:04,717 --> 02:32:09,358
LAURA: I remember a shield.

2434
02:32:09,358 --> 02:32:13,534
SAM: Shield?

2435
02:32:13,534 --> 02:32:18,191
LIAM: You look over your shoulder, and you see
that. There's two of them on the walls, to the

2436
02:32:18,191 --> 02:32:25,711
side of both doors. They're black with a red
barren tree in winter painted identically on each

2437
02:32:25,711 --> 02:32:27,496
one hanging decoratively.

2438
02:32:27,496 --> 02:32:37,136
SAM: Were the shields traps or something?

2439
02:32:37,203 --> 02:32:41,226
LAURA: There's a very specific thing we have to do
when we go down this hallway.

2440
02:32:41,226 --> 02:32:43,829
SAM: Okay, what is it?

2441
02:32:43,829 --> 02:32:48,047
LAURA: Well does somebody want to go over to the
shield on the right?

2442
02:32:48,047 --> 02:32:49,656
SAM: I will do it.

2443
02:32:49,656 --> 02:32:54,598
LAURA: Lift it up?

2444
02:32:54,598 --> 02:32:56,223
SAM: Will I die?

2445
02:32:56,223 --> 02:32:57,321
LAURA: No?

2446
02:32:57,321 --> 02:32:59,142
SAM: I lift it up.

2447
02:32:59,142 --> 02:33:04,848
LIAM: You place your hand, and you have to reach
pretty high, but you get up on your tiptoes and

2448
02:33:04,848 --> 02:33:07,740
reach and you push, and you feel it go (clunk).

2449
02:33:07,740 --> 02:33:13,927
SAM: Okay. Now what?

2450
02:33:13,927 --> 02:33:15,518
LAURA: Bring it back down.

2451
02:33:15,518 --> 02:33:16,731
SAM: I do.

2452
02:33:16,731 --> 02:33:20,647
LIAM: You dig your nails onto the curve and
(click) back to where it was.

2453
02:33:20,647 --> 02:33:26,120
LAURA: Pull it down.

2454
02:33:26,120 --> 02:33:28,365
SAM: Up down up down?

2455
02:33:28,365 --> 02:33:29,702
LIAM: Left right left right?

2456
02:33:29,702 --> 02:33:31,116
SAM: Sure, I pull it down.

2457
02:33:31,116 --> 02:33:32,606
LIAM: (click)

2458
02:33:32,606 --> 02:33:37,675
LAURA: Shit, I think I'm doing something wrong.

2459
02:33:37,675 --> 02:33:39,841
ASHLY: Something with the left shield?

2460
02:33:39,841 --> 02:33:41,630
LAURA: No, it was the one on the right.

2461
02:33:41,630 --> 02:33:47,311
SAM: Well this is just great, I'm glad we brought
you here as our guide.

2462
02:33:47,311 --> 02:33:53,704
LAURA: No, there's a second step. Can I look
around, do I see a wall sconce?

2463
02:33:53,704 --> 02:33:55,561
LIAM: Nope.

2464
02:33:55,561 --> 02:34:04,364
LAURA: There's no wall sconce? In the corner?
Shit. She changed some stuff.

2465
02:34:04,364 --> 02:34:05,788
SAM: All right. We should kill her.

2466
02:34:05,788 --> 02:34:07,353
TRAVIS: I think so too.

2467
02:34:07,353 --> 02:34:08,817
LAURA: No! You still need--

2468
02:34:08,817 --> 02:34:10,175
MARY: I pull out my rapier.

2469
02:34:10,175 --> 02:34:15,159
ASHLY: Wait guys! Hold on! We haven't even
examined the whole room! Right?

2470
02:34:15,159 --> 02:34:18,010
SAM: She's useless to us.

2471
02:34:18,010 --> 02:34:20,325
LAURA: The wall sconce is hiding behind these
books!

2472
02:34:20,325 --> 02:34:23,607
ASHLY: If we go deeper in the room you might see
something!

2473
02:34:23,607 --> 02:34:29,748
LIAM: I'll also remind you that there were two
doors that she opened using blood.

2474
02:34:29,748 --> 02:34:32,797
SAM: We've got to keep her hand with us.

2475
02:34:32,797 --> 02:34:35,103
MARY: We could keep a vial of her blood!

2476
02:34:35,103 --> 02:34:36,725
TRAVIS: Just bring her hand with us.

2477
02:34:36,725 --> 02:34:40,164
ASHLY: It's a lot easier if we take her with us, I
feel like.

2478
02:34:40,164 --> 02:34:42,779
MARY: So what were you trying to do with the
shield?

2479
02:34:42,779 --> 02:34:49,449
LAURA: Well I remember my grandma did some stuff,
and things happened, and we had to do things in a

2480
02:34:49,449 --> 02:34:51,476
very specific order, but she also said--

2481
02:34:51,476 --> 02:34:53,895
SAM: How did you do that?

2482
02:34:53,895 --> 02:35:01,289
LAURA: I don't know, these are so tight! I don't
even know how my hand came out of it. I also

2483
02:35:01,289 --> 02:35:03,974
remember her saying not to touch anything.

2484
02:35:03,974 --> 02:35:06,983
TRAVIS: (laughter) I can't imagine why.

2485
02:35:06,983 --> 02:35:11,519
LIAM: Obby, as she's rattling this off, you're
spacing out, looking around the room, checking out

2486
02:35:11,519 --> 02:35:15,601
the artwork on the wall. The one right above you
is of a ship, splitting open on the sea and the

2487
02:35:15,601 --> 02:35:22,512
crews are plunging into the waves in the center of
it. You look across the hall. Over there is one of

2488
02:35:22,512 --> 02:35:30,184
mourners at an open grave, filled to the brim with
blood. You also look around and notice a gorgeous

2489
02:35:30,184 --> 02:35:35,546
metallic egg, studded with jewels, all around it.
Beautiful.

2490
02:35:35,546 --> 02:35:36,929
SAM: How big?

2491
02:35:36,929 --> 02:35:43,240
LIAM: This big. A little bit bigger than a regular
egg. A teapot made out of... it looks like bone.

2492
02:35:43,240 --> 02:35:46,384
SAM: Well I like this art better.

2493
02:35:46,384 --> 02:35:55,259
LAURA: Don't touch it! I keep looking for a wall
sconce. Obby, when you touched the shield did you

2494
02:35:55,259 --> 02:35:56,855
hear a click? Did you hear anything click?

2495
02:35:56,855 --> 02:35:58,325
SAM: Yes. Felt a click.

2496
02:35:58,325 --> 02:36:01,162
LAURA: Let's look for the wall sconce!

2497
02:36:01,162 --> 02:36:04,993
SAM: We're supposed to push up the shield and then
tilt back a wall sconce or something?

2498
02:36:04,993 --> 02:36:07,006
LAURA: You pull out a wall sconce, yeah.

2499
02:36:07,006 --> 02:36:08,517
SAM: Pull out a wall sconce?

2500
02:36:08,517 --> 02:36:09,486
LAURA: Yeah.

2501
02:36:09,486 --> 02:36:11,963
MARY: Is there a holder for it behind one of the
paintings maybe?

2502
02:36:11,963 --> 02:36:13,667
LAURA: Do we see anything?

2503
02:36:13,667 --> 02:36:14,842
SAM: We can go look.

2504
02:36:14,842 --> 02:36:15,767
LIAM: Is there a what?

2505
02:36:15,767 --> 02:36:16,940
LAURA: A wall sconce.

2506
02:36:16,940 --> 02:36:21,301
LIAM: You remember where it was. It's not there.
The wall is smooth. There was a third step too;

2507
02:36:21,301 --> 02:36:22,548
you remember what it was?

2508
02:36:22,548 --> 02:36:23,675
LAURA: Well, yeah!

2509
02:36:23,675 --> 02:36:25,413
SAM: Where was the wall sconce?

2510
02:36:25,413 --> 02:36:26,837
LAURA: It was right there.

2511
02:36:26,837 --> 02:36:28,973
SAM: I feel right where she's pointing.

2512
02:36:28,973 --> 02:36:33,077
LIAM: You give a knock.

2513
02:36:33,077 --> 02:36:37,050
TRAVIS: Maybe we need her blood. Dren, cut her.

2514
02:36:37,050 --> 02:36:41,626
LAURA: No, there's more to do! Sheesh! Can I walk
down the hallway?

2515
02:36:41,626 --> 02:36:43,030
LIAM: You can, yeah.

2516
02:36:43,030 --> 02:36:46,814
ASHLY: Look, if there's traps, then she'll get hit
by them!

2517
02:36:46,814 --> 02:36:48,101
LIAM: Is that what you're doing?

2518
02:36:48,101 --> 02:36:51,225
LAURA: Can I look for traps as I'm walking down
the hall?

2519
02:36:51,225 --> 02:36:53,116
LIAM: Sure, make a perception check.

2520
02:36:53,116 --> 02:36:55,458
TRAVIS: Where were the shields? Were they at the
bottom of the hallway from where we are?

2521
02:36:55,458 --> 02:36:57,843
LIAM: No, they were hanging up on the sides of the
doors decoratively.

2522
02:36:57,843 --> 02:36:58,805
TRAVIS: That we came in?

2523
02:36:58,805 --> 02:36:59,779
LIAM: Yeah, the ones you came in.

2524
02:36:59,779 --> 02:37:00,904
ASHLY: I also make a perception check.

2525
02:37:00,904 --> 02:37:01,952
LAURA: Eight!

2526
02:37:01,952 --> 02:37:03,060
ASHLY: 17!

2527
02:37:03,060 --> 02:37:05,770
TRAVIS: Can I check the floor for traps?

2528
02:37:05,770 --> 02:37:07,056
LIAM: The floor, sure.

2529
02:37:07,056 --> 02:37:11,651
SAM: I'm going to check the shield to see if I can
intuit how it works.

2530
02:37:11,651 --> 02:37:13,046
LIAM: Investigation check.

2531
02:37:13,046 --> 02:37:13,896
TRAVIS: 19.

2532
02:37:13,896 --> 02:37:15,048
SAM: Four!

2533
02:37:15,048 --> 02:37:27,272
LIAM: Tarvis, you see poking out of the edge of
the carpet-- you know how downstairs there was a

2534
02:37:27,272 --> 02:37:35,979
long red carpet? There's one here as well. You see
a bit of scrawl, something poking out of the edge

2535
02:37:35,979 --> 02:37:38,922
of the rug about eight feet in front of you.

2536
02:37:38,922 --> 02:37:46,399
TRAVIS: Be careful of the rug. It's booby
trapped!

2537
02:37:46,399 --> 02:37:54,456
LAURA: (gasp) Okay! Do I see a bowl? A plate
anywhere? A bowl with water in it?

2538
02:37:54,456 --> 02:37:56,018
LIAM: Not off-hand, no.

2539
02:37:56,018 --> 02:37:57,930
ASHLY: Do I, because I got a 17?

2540
02:37:57,930 --> 02:38:04,776
LIAM: No bowl. You do see a really cool little
brass and wood clockwork owl? That's cool.

2541
02:38:04,776 --> 02:38:06,094
ASHLY: That is cool.

2542
02:38:06,094 --> 02:38:08,835
SAM: Should we start opening things and--

2543
02:38:08,835 --> 02:38:11,401
LAURA: No, don't touch anything!

2544
02:38:11,401 --> 02:38:13,257
SAM: Well something needs to happen or we leave
this room.

2545
02:38:13,257 --> 02:38:19,383
ASHLY: Devan and I will go deeper into the room,
and if anything goes screwy, we'll get hit by it,

2546
02:38:19,383 --> 02:38:21,009
and then maybe we'll find that wall sconce!

2547
02:38:21,009 --> 02:38:24,372
TRAVIS: No, Dren, you stay here. Delweth will go
with Devan.

2548
02:38:24,372 --> 02:38:25,911
ASHLY: Okay.

2549
02:38:25,911 --> 02:38:28,436
LIAM: Walking forward? Going down the hall?

2550
02:38:28,436 --> 02:38:32,399
LAURA: I send a message to Dren--

2551
02:38:32,399 --> 02:38:38,249
TRAVIS: I walk up to the little part of the carpet
that has the little bit sticking out from under

2552
02:38:38,249 --> 02:38:39,042
the carpet.

2553
02:38:39,042 --> 02:38:40,299
LIAM: You do that before they walk off?

2554
02:38:40,299 --> 02:38:41,439
TRAVIS: Yes, before they go.

2555
02:38:41,439 --> 02:38:50,183
LIAM: All right, you peel it back; there is some
sort of arcane scrawl on the floor.

2556
02:38:50,183 --> 02:38:51,321
TRAVIS: Like, scrawl?

2557
02:38:51,321 --> 02:38:58,019
LIAM: Yeah, like a ring written in a circle. You
tug the rug back a bit and you see it goes further

2558
02:38:58,019 --> 02:39:03,393
under the carpet and you see the edge of a spiral
pattern of writing that you can't--

2559
02:39:03,393 --> 02:39:04,711
MARY: Is it Elvish?

2560
02:39:04,711 --> 02:39:05,709
TRAVIS: I was going to ask.

2561
02:39:05,709 --> 02:39:06,754
LIAM: It's not.

2562
02:39:06,754 --> 02:39:07,774
TRAVIS: Oh, it's not?

2563
02:39:07,774 --> 02:39:08,686
LIAM: No.

2564
02:39:08,686 --> 02:39:09,712
MARY: Dwarvish?

2565
02:39:09,712 --> 02:39:10,702
LIAM: No.

2566
02:39:10,702 --> 02:39:11,767
TRAVIS: Orcish?

2567
02:39:11,767 --> 02:39:14,999
LIAM: Make an arcana check.

2568
02:39:14,999 --> 02:39:21,408
TRAVIS: Oh, me? No problem. That's a motherfucking
one.

2569
02:39:21,408 --> 02:39:23,888
(laughter)

2570
02:39:23,888 --> 02:39:25,434
LIAM: That is Esperanto.

2571
02:39:25,434 --> 02:39:26,682
TRAVIS: Cool.

2572
02:39:26,682 --> 02:39:30,852
SAM: I can jump on things and unlock things.

2573
02:39:30,852 --> 02:39:38,450
MARY: All right, we will start walking very
slowly. Can I do a perception check for any traps

2574
02:39:38,450 --> 02:39:43,290
down this hallway? Or is it all sort of fucked
anyway?

2575
02:39:43,290 --> 02:39:48,795
LIAM: It's a long hallway and there's so much shit
in here that it's like process a little bit as you go.

2576
02:39:48,795 --> 02:39:51,519
MARY: All right, let's take it real slow.

2577
02:39:51,519 --> 02:39:53,223
TRAVIS: What if you do an arcana check?

2578
02:39:53,223 --> 02:39:55,474
MARY: Can I do an arcana check on the scrawl?

2579
02:39:55,474 --> 02:39:56,949
LIAM: Sure.

2580
02:39:56,949 --> 02:40:06,606
MARY: Forget about it. That's 18 plus, what do I
add? 18 plus three, that's 21.

2581
02:40:06,606 --> 02:40:08,508
LIAM: Yeah, you know what this is.

2582
02:40:08,508 --> 02:40:09,758
MARY: Of course I do.

2583
02:40:09,758 --> 02:40:11,457
LIAM: How do you think you know magic? You had to
study.

2584
02:40:11,457 --> 02:40:14,404
MARY: Yeah! I know what this is.

2585
02:40:14,404 --> 02:40:19,884
LIAM: You don't know all of it. You would never be
able to make this on your own, but you recognize

2586
02:40:19,884 --> 02:40:31,538
some of the key glyphs in it. This is a magic
sigil. This will turn gravity haywire here. You

2587
02:40:31,538 --> 02:40:42,184
look straight up at one of the iron, gothic,
tooth-like chandeliers, right above it.

2588
02:40:42,184 --> 02:40:48,768
MARY: Right. Do not step here. From what I can
see, if you do, you'll be thrown up into the

2589
02:40:48,768 --> 02:40:54,104
ceiling, into the teeth of this fantastic
chandelier. So, my recommendation would be to go

2590
02:40:54,104 --> 02:40:55,292
around.

2591
02:40:55,292 --> 02:40:57,535
TRAVIS: If we cross this threshold or if we step
here?

2592
02:40:57,535 --> 02:40:59,606
LAURA: Are there any wall sconces up top?

2593
02:40:59,606 --> 02:41:00,772
TRAVIS: Are there?

2594
02:41:00,772 --> 02:41:05,379
LIAM: No. There is enough room on the sides to
gingerly step around this.

2595
02:41:05,379 --> 02:41:14,789
MARY: I grab the back of the rope of your hands.
You're in the lead. I'm behind you. I hold you

2596
02:41:14,789 --> 02:41:21,689
with my left hand and I have my rapier in my
right. We start to move very slowly on exposed

2597
02:41:21,689 --> 02:41:24,643
wood that we can see whether or not there's going
to be any--

2598
02:41:24,643 --> 02:41:31,087
LIAM: So what are you saying, someone's pulling
carpet as you go or? It's one carpet that goes all

2599
02:41:31,087 --> 02:41:37,228
the way down the hall and Tarvis went and under
this part of the carpet was one area.

2600
02:41:37,228 --> 02:41:40,703
SAM: We're avoiding the carpet altogether.

2601
02:41:40,703 --> 02:41:43,139
MARY: We can't because it's wall to wall, right?

2602
02:41:43,139 --> 02:41:48,755
LIAM: It's not wall to wall. It's a very wide hall
and it's down the center and all the eclectic

2603
02:41:48,755 --> 02:41:53,759
craziness is piled up to the sides of it. I mean
some stuff spills over on the rug, but it's pretty

2604
02:41:53,759 --> 02:41:55,067
hodge podge.

2605
02:41:55,067 --> 02:41:56,935
TRAVIS: Were there windows that were along the
wall?

2606
02:41:56,935 --> 02:41:58,160
LIAM: No windows up here.

2607
02:41:58,160 --> 02:42:00,113
MARY: So we make our way down the right side on
the wood.

2608
02:42:00,113 --> 02:42:06,000
LIAM: You can't do that because the wood all the
way down is taken up by things like jars with

2609
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:08,076
pickled unicorns in them.

2610
02:42:08,076 --> 02:42:11,723
LAURA: But we can avoid the gravity scrawl--

2611
02:42:11,723 --> 02:42:13,527
LIAM: This one spot you can sneak around.

2612
02:42:13,527 --> 02:42:17,402
MARY: All right, we'll sneak around that and
slowly work our way forward.

2613
02:42:17,402 --> 02:42:20,859
LAURA: Keeping an eye on the ground for any more
of those things.

2614
02:42:20,859 --> 02:42:30,408
LIAM: Okay. You pass by a portrait of a woman all
in black, stiff, austere dress, a cold white face,

2615
02:42:30,408 --> 02:42:35,667
and you double take and look at it again and
realise that that woman is dead and there's a fly

2616
02:42:35,667 --> 02:42:42,462
crawling in the side of her mouth. On the other
side there's a painting of a large still lake

2617
02:42:42,462 --> 02:42:47,384
stretching away from the shore and there's a small
boat drifting off in the middle. And there's a

2618
02:42:47,384 --> 02:42:52,654
piece of fabric draped into the water and things
floating in the side of it.

2619
02:42:52,654 --> 02:42:57,496
MARY: Grandmother had a very strange definition of
fun.

2620
02:42:57,496 --> 02:43:01,099
LAURA: I think she might be into some creepy
shit.

2621
02:43:01,099 --> 02:43:04,866
TRAVIS: Is the dead woman behind a case or is she
out, the dead woman?

2622
02:43:04,866 --> 02:43:10,847
LIAM: It's a painting. You see an assortment of
bells covering the top of one table, all different

2623
02:43:10,847 --> 02:43:17,012
sizes and different colors of metal. A platter
with a series of bone needles lying on it. You see

2624
02:43:17,012 --> 02:43:28,808
a stuffed ostrich with a little skull cap metal
pith helmet with a spike coming out of it. On one

2625
02:43:28,808 --> 02:43:38,620
armoire, there's a shiny black stone wasp as big
as a bird, also gorgeous. A wicker rabbit with

2626
02:43:38,620 --> 02:43:40,694
antlers protruding from its head.

2627
02:43:40,694 --> 02:43:42,819
MARY: A wabbit with antlers.

2628
02:43:42,819 --> 02:43:45,158
LIAM: Yes. Arcane jackalope.

2629
02:43:45,158 --> 02:43:47,383
SAM: Tarvis has told me to pick up the wasp.

2630
02:43:47,383 --> 02:43:49,681
LAURA: Don't pick up anything! Don't touch
anything!

2631
02:43:49,681 --> 02:43:50,892
LIAM: Pick up the wasp?

2632
02:43:50,892 --> 02:43:52,301
LAURA: Seriously.

2633
02:43:52,301 --> 02:43:54,290
LIAM: Make a con save.

2634
02:43:54,290 --> 02:43:56,799
TRAVIS: Well you don't have to.

2635
02:43:56,799 --> 02:44:00,097
LIAM: It is done. Make a con save my friend.

2636
02:44:00,097 --> 02:44:01,709
SAM: Natural 20.

2637
02:44:01,709 --> 02:44:07,665
LIAM: Well you pick it up and look at it and it is
gorgeous and shines. It glints in the light. It

2638
02:44:07,665 --> 02:44:21,081
curls in on itself and the stinger goes into your
wrist. You take two points of damage.

2639
02:44:21,081 --> 02:44:22,679
SAM: What kind?

2640
02:44:22,679 --> 02:44:24,513
LIAM: Poison.

2641
02:44:24,513 --> 02:44:32,373
SAM: No, I am a dwarf, advantage on saves versus
poison, resistance against poison damage.

2642
02:44:32,373 --> 02:44:40,101
LIAM: Resistant, nice! You take one point and you
have a small red hole bleeding out in your hand.

2643
02:44:40,101 --> 02:44:43,791
SAM: I suck the poison out. I swallow it down.

2644
02:44:43,791 --> 02:44:46,501
TRAVIS: You are hard as nails, Obby the Rat.

2645
02:44:46,501 --> 02:44:54,931
LAURA: Through all of this have we seen a wall
sconce?

2646
02:44:54,931 --> 02:45:00,408
LIAM: You're still walking down the hall. What's
our order, by the way?

2647
02:45:00,408 --> 02:45:04,305
MARY: Devan's first, I'm second.

2648
02:45:04,305 --> 02:45:05,947
LIAM: Devan's first.

2649
02:45:05,947 --> 02:45:08,431
TRAVIS: I'm third, Dren's fourth.

2650
02:45:08,431 --> 02:45:10,538
LIAM: There's also enough room to go side by side,
which is--

2651
02:45:10,538 --> 02:45:11,920
MARY: No, I know, but I'm pushing her forward.

2652
02:45:11,920 --> 02:45:14,091
LIAM: Everyone going single-file, yeah? Who's
third?

2653
02:45:14,091 --> 02:45:17,794
TRAVIS: I am. And Obby in the rear, like he likes
it.

2654
02:45:17,794 --> 02:45:20,027
LIAM: So you continue to walk?

2655
02:45:20,027 --> 02:45:24,245
MARY: Slowly, investigating everything as we go.

2656
02:45:24,245 --> 02:45:26,721
LIAM: Are you looking for traps, further traps?

2657
02:45:26,721 --> 02:45:31,214
MARY: I use my Mage Hand to push the carpet as we
go forward to see if there's anything--

2658
02:45:31,214 --> 02:45:38,835
LIAM: Sure, but also make a perception check. This
is a crowded-- this is not your normal room.

2659
02:45:38,835 --> 02:45:40,237
TRAVIS: 24.

2660
02:45:40,237 --> 02:45:41,429
SAM: 17.

2661
02:45:41,429 --> 02:45:42,836
MARY: 21.

2662
02:45:42,836 --> 02:45:47,274
ASHLY: I got a three, so all things I could
perceive with a three just go ahead and tell me.

2663
02:45:47,274 --> 02:45:48,838
LAURA: I rolled a three as well!

2664
02:45:48,838 --> 02:45:53,133
TRAVIS: Jeez. Fucking turtledoves.

2665
02:45:53,133 --> 02:45:56,515
LIAM: All right, so you're still walking forward,
right?

2666
02:45:56,515 --> 02:45:58,168
MARY: Yep, Mage Handing the carpet.

2667
02:45:58,168 --> 02:46:00,462
LIAM: Okay. So as you're walking--

2668
02:46:00,462 --> 02:46:01,732
MARY: Balls.

2669
02:46:01,732 --> 02:46:07,071
LIAM: Devan (whoosh) is gone.

2670
02:46:07,071 --> 02:46:09,742
MARY: She's gone? Tarvis?

2671
02:46:09,742 --> 02:46:12,324
TRAVIS: Strike! Find her.

2672
02:46:12,324 --> 02:46:13,847
ASHLY: Devan?

2673
02:46:13,847 --> 02:46:15,429
MARY: Devan!

2674
02:46:15,429 --> 02:46:26,841
LIAM: Hold that thought. Devan. You are instantly
submerged in water. It is pitch black. You can't

2675
02:46:26,841 --> 02:46:33,738
see anything. You are underwater. Your hands are
tied behind your back.

2676
02:46:33,738 --> 02:46:35,338
LAURA: Oh shit!

2677
02:46:35,338 --> 02:46:47,579
LIAM: You hold your breath. You <i>immediately</i> feel
multiple bites all over your body. Make a

2678
02:46:47,579 --> 02:46:49,677
constitution save, please.

2679
02:46:49,677 --> 02:46:53,971
MARY: Do I have the end of the rope, that was...?
I was holding the rope.

2680
02:46:53,971 --> 02:46:55,547
LAURA: 19.

2681
02:46:55,547 --> 02:47:10,609
LIAM: 19? Okay. Whoops, that's the wrong one. You
feel small sharp teeth biting on every inch of

2682
02:47:10,609 --> 02:47:15,222
your body. Your neck, your face, your hands,
everywhere, biting through your clothes. You feel

2683
02:47:15,222 --> 02:47:22,917
a burning sensation under your skin in your blood,
and you take five points of poison damage. You

2684
02:47:22,917 --> 02:47:31,079
can't see what's going on. You kick and start to
panic. You can't tell which way is up. You can't

2685
02:47:31,079 --> 02:47:37,481
tell which way is down. You guys. She's been gone
for 30 seconds.

2686
02:47:37,481 --> 02:47:40,239
SAM: Where did she go? Feel the floor around where
she was standing.

2687
02:47:40,239 --> 02:47:43,708
MARY: I don't know. I step forward into where she
was.

2688
02:47:43,708 --> 02:47:48,068
LAURA: Oh no!

2689
02:47:48,068 --> 02:47:50,799
MARY: No? Is that a bad idea?

2690
02:47:50,799 --> 02:47:52,066
TRAVIS: You did it.

2691
02:47:52,066 --> 02:47:53,189
MARY: I did it.

2692
02:47:53,189 --> 02:47:54,500
LIAM: Nothing happens.

2693
02:47:54,500 --> 02:47:55,573
MARY: Nothing?!

2694
02:47:55,573 --> 02:47:59,703
SAM: Wait, what are the objects around us that we
can see immediately around us?

2695
02:47:59,703 --> 02:48:06,332
LIAM: Around you? There were bone needles. There
were bells. There were creepy as fuck paintings.

2696
02:48:06,332 --> 02:48:09,897
There's an ostrich with a little spike helmet on
his head.

2697
02:48:09,897 --> 02:48:11,394
SAM: One of the paintings was water?

2698
02:48:11,394 --> 02:48:12,414
LIAM: One was a lake.

2699
02:48:12,414 --> 02:48:14,183
TRAVIS: Do we see her splashing around in the
painting?

2700
02:48:14,183 --> 02:48:15,829
LIAM: 45 seconds have passed.

2701
02:48:15,829 --> 02:48:17,855
SAM: I go to the water painting and start feeling
it.

2702
02:48:17,855 --> 02:48:20,029
LIAM: What's your constitution modifier, Laura?

2703
02:48:20,029 --> 02:48:21,508
LAURA: Plus six.

2704
02:48:21,508 --> 02:48:24,795
ASHLY: I go and splash around in the water. Does
anything happen?

2705
02:48:24,795 --> 02:48:26,123
LIAM: What water? There's no water.

2706
02:48:26,123 --> 02:48:27,797
ASHLY: Isn't there water? Oh, in the painting.

2707
02:48:27,797 --> 02:48:30,489
SAM: I'm looking at the painting to see if there's
anything.

2708
02:48:30,489 --> 02:48:33,653
LIAM: Okay, make a perception check.

2709
02:48:33,653 --> 02:48:34,993
SAM: 12.

2710
02:48:34,993 --> 02:48:39,345
LIAM: Okay. Nothing.

2711
02:48:39,345 --> 02:48:41,909
MARY: I pull the painting off the wall and stick
my dagger into it.

2712
02:48:41,909 --> 02:48:50,205
LIAM: You pull the painting off the wall and see a
scrawl of arcane glyphs in a circle, there. No,

2713
02:48:50,205 --> 02:48:54,111
it's right parallel to where Devan was.

2714
02:48:54,111 --> 02:49:01,168
MARY: Okay. All right, glyphs, perception check on
the glyphs? Arcane check, arcana?

2715
02:49:01,168 --> 02:49:03,299
LIAM: Yeah, arcana check.

2716
02:49:03,299 --> 02:49:04,680
LAURA: Can I do anything?

2717
02:49:04,680 --> 02:49:06,317
MARY: Natural one.

2718
02:49:06,317 --> 02:49:11,496
LIAM: You are short-circuiting. You're so
discombobulated by this scenario--

2719
02:49:11,496 --> 02:49:13,321
LAURA: I'm going to die!

2720
02:49:13,321 --> 02:49:16,657
TRAVIS: I come up behind her because she's made
this discovery, I try one as well.

2721
02:49:16,657 --> 02:49:18,349
MARY: Tarvis, Tarvis!

2722
02:49:18,349 --> 02:49:23,931
TRAVIS: Wow! You're just destined to die! That's
two in a row!

2723
02:49:23,931 --> 02:49:27,464
LIAM: Just around this scrawl of arcana on the
wall, going gabba, gabba gabba gabba.

2724
02:49:27,464 --> 02:49:31,224
ASHLY: Four.

2725
02:49:31,224 --> 02:49:37,884
SAM: Don't worry, Obby the Rat knows what to do.
What is this? 13.

2726
02:49:37,884 --> 02:49:40,134
LIAM: 13. You don't know what the fuck that says.

2727
02:49:40,134 --> 02:49:42,595
SAM: I know what it says. I reach my arm into it.

2728
02:49:42,595 --> 02:49:50,639
LIAM: (impact) Ow! That's when you hear at the end
of the hall, in this hall you're in, in addition

2729
02:49:50,639 --> 02:49:58,016
to all this shit, there's six doors all the way
down. You've barely even paid attention to them

2730
02:49:58,016 --> 02:49:59,520
because of all the stuff that's in here.

2731
02:49:59,520 --> 02:50:03,636
You've already passed a set of doors behind
you, and then there's another two, and another two

2732
02:50:03,636 --> 02:50:07,349
all the way at the end of the hall. And at the end
of the hall, on the right, behind the closed door,

2733
02:50:07,349 --> 02:50:08,974
you hear (impact).

2734
02:50:08,974 --> 02:50:12,756
ASHLY: I run toward that door.

2735
02:50:12,756 --> 02:50:15,927
TRAVIS: I go with her.

2736
02:50:15,927 --> 02:50:21,096
LIAM: Okay, you two are bolting down the red
carpet. They all have the same turn-latch door

2737
02:50:21,096 --> 02:50:27,021
handle that the original doors do, and you get to
the door and freeze for a second?

2738
02:50:27,021 --> 02:50:28,539
ASHLY: I open it.

2739
02:50:28,539 --> 02:50:32,709
LIAM: As soon as you touch the door handle,
electricity goes up your arm.

2740
02:50:32,709 --> 02:50:37,067
SAM: All the traps have been sprung.

2741
02:50:37,067 --> 02:50:38,912
LAURA: Just all of them.

2742
02:50:38,912 --> 02:50:40,533
TRAVIS: Fucking fun room.

2743
02:50:40,533 --> 02:50:43,146
LIAM: Dexterity save on that.

2744
02:50:43,146 --> 02:50:45,488
ASHLY: Okay, five, and then I do this guy?

2745
02:50:45,488 --> 02:50:48,031
SAM: Tarvis. We can let Devan die.

2746
02:50:48,031 --> 02:50:49,690
ASHLY: 17?

2747
02:50:49,690 --> 02:51:01,324
LIAM: You take only five points of electricity
damage. So you've just been electrocuted by the

2748
02:51:01,324 --> 02:51:08,815
door handle, but the door does open, and you hold
your hand. You look in. The room is somewhat lit

2749
02:51:08,815 --> 02:51:14,698
from the lights behind you, and you see a large
20-feet-tall cube of glass, a fish tank, and

2750
02:51:14,698 --> 02:51:16,627
inside it, you can see a form going--

2751
02:51:16,627 --> 02:51:20,638
ASHLY: I start smashing it with my shortsword.

2752
02:51:20,638 --> 02:51:22,183
LIAM: Okay. Everybody roll initiative.

2753
02:51:22,183 --> 02:51:26,560
ASHLY: 19.

2754
02:51:26,560 --> 02:51:28,776
LAURA: 19 as well!

2755
02:51:28,776 --> 02:51:31,003
ASHLY and LAURA: Yes!

2756
02:51:31,003 --> 02:51:35,349
MARY: 20.

2757
02:51:35,349 --> 02:51:41,472
LIAM: 20, okay. What about you, gentlemen?

2758
02:51:41,472 --> 02:51:42,786
SAM: Eight.

2759
02:51:42,786 --> 02:51:51,537
TRAVIS: Seven. Leading from the front. Haven't hit
shit yet. Not one thing.

2760
02:51:51,537 --> 02:52:01,372
LIAM: Okay. All right, so Devan, the fish continue
to bite.

2761
02:52:01,372 --> 02:52:02,917
LAURA: Can I do anything?

2762
02:52:02,917 --> 02:52:05,173
LIAM: In a second, you can.

2763
02:52:05,173 --> 02:52:12,564
MARY: Do they bite the rope, and they eat the
rope? The fishes? They don't know what's flesh.

2764
02:52:12,564 --> 02:52:14,906
LIAM: Make another con save.

2765
02:52:14,906 --> 02:52:18,786
SAM: You are dead. You're a dead person.

2766
02:52:18,786 --> 02:52:22,988
LAURA: 24!

2767
02:52:22,988 --> 02:52:25,890
LIAM: All right, take eight more points of poison
damage.

2768
02:52:25,890 --> 02:52:27,638
LAURA: Seriously?!

2769
02:52:27,638 --> 02:52:37,317
LIAM: Okay, Delweth, you are up. You guys are
here. This is so stupid. There's a fish tank in

2770
02:52:37,317 --> 02:52:39,065
here you guys are looking at.

2771
02:52:39,065 --> 02:52:40,872
SAM: Draw a fish tank.

2772
02:52:40,872 --> 02:52:42,472
LIAM: Delweth, you're up, what would you like to
do?

2773
02:52:42,472 --> 02:52:44,756
MARY: I would like to try some acid against the
fish tank.

2774
02:52:44,756 --> 02:52:50,818
LIAM: Do what against the fish tank? Acid? Sure,
you throw it. You don't even have to do anything.

2775
02:52:50,818 --> 02:52:58,393
Your hand goes and a globule goes (splash) and
starts to sizzle down the sides of this glass.

2776
02:52:58,393 --> 02:53:00,105
Roll 1d6.

2777
02:53:00,105 --> 02:53:02,989
TRAVIS: That's the cube.

2778
02:53:02,989 --> 02:53:06,714
MARY: Three.

2779
02:53:06,714 --> 02:53:17,093
LIAM: Okay. It seems to be very thick. And now it
is Dren's turn.

2780
02:53:17,170 --> 02:53:25,254
MARY: If you want to be sneaky-sneaky, we can see
the corner of your--

2781
02:53:25,254 --> 02:53:30,821
ASHLY: Can I assassinate the fish tank? Is this
the top of the fight? I'm going to attack it with

2782
02:53:30,821 --> 02:53:32,332
my shortsword.

2783
02:53:32,332 --> 02:53:33,854
LIAM: Go for it.

2784
02:53:33,854 --> 02:53:37,562
ASHLY: Okay. It's 18.

2785
02:53:37,562 --> 02:53:39,867
LIAM: Sure, hit the shit out of that fish tank.

2786
02:53:39,867 --> 02:53:41,034
ASHLY: Is it a sneak attack?

2787
02:53:41,034 --> 02:53:42,013
LIAM: No.

2788
02:53:42,013 --> 02:53:46,342
ASHLY: Damn it. Okay. It is ten.

2789
02:53:46,342 --> 02:53:52,054
LIAM: Ten, okay. Devan, you may try to do
something.

2790
02:53:52,054 --> 02:53:56,358
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to cast Chromatic Orb.

2791
02:53:56,358 --> 02:54:01,225
SAM: With what verbal command?

2792
02:54:01,225 --> 02:54:04,670
LAURA: Well then, I'm going to use one of my
sorcerer points to do a subtle thing, because I

2793
02:54:04,670 --> 02:54:05,853
can do it without any verbal components.

2794
02:54:05,853 --> 02:54:06,861
LIAM: Good, well done.

2795
02:54:06,861 --> 02:54:09,492
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to cast Chromatic Orb as a
thunder attack.

2796
02:54:09,492 --> 02:54:15,441
LIAM: What about the hand motions, though? That's
what one of the other ones is. I see V, S, M next

2797
02:54:15,441 --> 02:54:21,206
to Chromatic Orb. Verbal... I forget what they
stand for. But one is-- components? One is verbal

2798
02:54:21,206 --> 02:54:22,801
and then one is doing this stuff.

2799
02:54:22,801 --> 02:54:28,511
LAURA: Can I try for a movement to wiggle my hands
out, because it's kind of loose?

2800
02:54:28,511 --> 02:54:33,277
LIAM: You can make a dexterity check at
disadvantage.

2801
02:54:33,277 --> 02:54:42,111
LAURA: Oh, shit, balls. What was the first one?
Was it a ten? 11.

2802
02:54:42,111 --> 02:54:43,729
LIAM: Nope.

2803
02:54:43,729 --> 02:54:44,984
LAURA: Come on!

2804
02:54:44,984 --> 02:54:47,268
LIAM: Tarvis, you're up.

2805
02:54:47,268 --> 02:54:49,151
LAURA: Wait, no, I still get to do something!

2806
02:54:49,151 --> 02:54:50,463
LIAM: Okay.

2807
02:54:50,463 --> 02:54:55,647
LAURA: I'm going to try and swim forward and start
kicking against the glass.

2808
02:54:55,647 --> 02:55:00,853
LIAM: You swim your way-- some light has shined
through once that door opened out there, although

2809
02:55:00,853 --> 02:55:05,478
you can't really tell why. The light's coming. You
swim towards light. You get over there. Tarvis,

2810
02:55:05,478 --> 02:55:06,522
you're up.

2811
02:55:06,522 --> 02:55:11,629
TRAVIS: I take the scimitar and try and hit the
non-moving, non-armed fish tank. Okay.

2812
02:55:11,629 --> 02:55:14,212
LIAM: Roll. Don't roll a one.

2813
02:55:14,212 --> 02:55:15,390
ASHLY: Did you?

2814
02:55:15,390 --> 02:55:17,122
TRAVIS: It's an eight.

2815
02:55:17,122 --> 02:55:18,394
LIAM: All right, you hit it, yeah.

2816
02:55:18,394 --> 02:55:23,699
TRAVIS: Yay! Seven.

2817
02:55:23,699 --> 02:55:29,473
LIAM: Okay. The glass goes (glass cracking). It
holds.

2818
02:55:29,473 --> 02:55:33,464
LAURA: Technically, did I have to waste a sorcerer
point for that, since I couldn't actually do the spell?

2819
02:55:33,464 --> 02:55:36,982
LIAM: No. Okay, Rat, you're up.

2820
02:55:36,982 --> 02:55:44,267
SAM: Did we all run down to the thing? I was
futzing with the art.

2821
02:55:44,267 --> 02:55:46,019
LIAM: You were. So you're there.

2822
02:55:46,019 --> 02:55:50,874
SAM: I'll use my movement to run into the room.
Can I get there?

2823
02:55:50,874 --> 02:55:54,503
LIAM: Okay. Actually nobody should have gotten
there, but it's okay.

2824
02:55:54,503 --> 02:55:57,486
MARY: It's all right, through the magic--

2825
02:55:57,486 --> 02:56:03,736
LIAM: It's all right, she's half-fucked anyway.
What would you like to do?

2826
02:56:03,736 --> 02:56:05,176
SAM: I'm in the room?

2827
02:56:05,176 --> 02:56:06,855
LIAM: No, you're not, because you were futzing
with the painting. So we'll say you were the last

2828
02:56:06,855 --> 02:56:07,971
one in.

2829
02:56:07,971 --> 02:56:12,152
SAM: Then I say: why is everyone in here? Oh!

2830
02:56:12,152 --> 02:56:17,707
LIAM: Okay, we're now back-- no we're not.

2831
02:56:17,707 --> 02:56:20,430
MARY: Oh shit.

2832
02:56:20,430 --> 02:56:21,765
LIAM: Make a constitution save.

2833
02:56:21,765 --> 02:56:23,022
TRAVIS: Take a big breath in. Everybody?

2834
02:56:23,022 --> 02:56:24,710
SAM: No, drowny girl.

2835
02:56:24,710 --> 02:56:27,579
LAURA: Ten.

2836
02:56:27,579 --> 02:56:34,048
LIAM: Ten is not going to do it. Three points of
poison damage.

2837
02:56:34,048 --> 02:56:35,832
SAM: She dead.

2838
02:56:35,832 --> 02:56:37,544
LAURA: Not yet.

2839
02:56:37,544 --> 02:56:40,804
LIAM: All right, now we're at the top. Delweth.

2840
02:56:40,804 --> 02:56:53,406
MARY: Right. Since Poison Spray won't do
anything, I'm going to take my rapier and stab it

2841
02:56:53,406 --> 02:56:58,061
into the biggest part of the crack, where the acid
is, and the crack meet.

2842
02:56:58,061 --> 02:57:00,537
LIAM: Roll to attack. I'm sure you'll hit it.

2843
02:57:00,537 --> 02:57:05,201
MARY: 13 plus whatever.

2844
02:57:05,201 --> 02:57:06,402
LIAM: That hits.

2845
02:57:06,402 --> 02:57:07,367
MARY: It hits? All right.

2846
02:57:07,367 --> 02:57:09,913
LAURA and ASHLY: It's a box.

2847
02:57:09,913 --> 02:57:12,495
LIAM: It's got a very low armor class.

2848
02:57:12,495 --> 02:57:17,279
MARY: Seven. Plus three. Ten.

2849
02:57:17,279 --> 02:57:22,778
LIAM: Okay, so you run up with your thin little
sword and go, "Ugh! Oh fuck this," and you turn it

2850
02:57:22,778 --> 02:57:27,694
around and go (impact) into the side of the glass
(glass cracking) and a little bit of water starts

2851
02:57:27,694 --> 02:57:31,757
spilling out near the bottom. Devan-- no, Dren--

2852
02:57:31,757 --> 02:57:33,738
MARY: And I don't get a bonus action to do
anything else?

2853
02:57:33,738 --> 02:57:35,475
LIAM: You do. Sure, if you have an idea, yeah.

2854
02:57:35,475 --> 02:57:36,684
SAM: Disengage.

2855
02:57:36,684 --> 02:57:43,680
MARY: I hide from the spray of water! Because it
could be poison. I back up three feet.

2856
02:57:43,680 --> 02:57:46,816
ASHLY: I'm going to attack it again with my
shortsword.

2857
02:57:46,816 --> 02:57:48,039
LIAM: Yes, yes.

2858
02:57:48,039 --> 02:57:55,912
ASHLY: I hit it. And I'm going to do one of these
guys. Nine.

2859
02:57:55,912 --> 02:58:06,878
LIAM: Okay. A piece breaks out and water starts
spilling out. It's very tall. Tarvis, it's your turn.

2860
02:58:06,878 --> 02:58:08,120
LAURA: Wait!

2861
02:58:08,120 --> 02:58:09,558
LIAM: Oh sorry, Devan's turn, Devan's turn.

2862
02:58:09,558 --> 02:58:11,289
LAURA: Can I try to get my hands free again?

2863
02:58:11,289 --> 02:58:12,957
LIAM: Yes. Make a dex save.

2864
02:58:12,957 --> 02:58:26,355
LAURA: At disadvantage. Come on! Five. Okay, I
kick at the crack. Can I at least kick at the crack?

2865
02:58:26,355 --> 02:58:33,157
LIAM: You spent your whole action going-- So you
get a bonus action.

2866
02:58:33,157 --> 02:58:35,305
LAURA: Sucks. I can't--

2867
02:58:35,305 --> 02:58:39,158
ASHLY: Can she swim to the hole and try to get a
breath?

2868
02:58:39,158 --> 02:58:42,561
MARY: Is there any air that's come out now that
the water's come down?

2869
02:58:42,561 --> 02:58:44,620
LAURA: It hasn't reached that spot yet.

2870
02:58:44,620 --> 02:58:45,970
TRAVIS: It's a cube, right?

2871
02:58:45,970 --> 02:58:51,382
LAURA: Oh! Wait! Okay, wait! Oh, this is stupid,
because I feel like I'm about to be free, but I

2872
02:58:51,455 --> 02:59:00,993
wouldn't know that, that's metagaming. Can I see
that there's a crack in it? All right. Then I'm

2873
02:59:00,993 --> 02:59:09,033
going to cast Misty Step and get out of the box.
It's a verbal, so I would use a sorcery point.

2874
02:59:09,033 --> 02:59:20,100
LIAM: Okay. There's a big (splash) as water slaps
together, and a drenched, coughing, pale-skinned,

2875
02:59:20,100 --> 02:59:25,612
veins going down her neck Devan appears on the
ground, between you and you.

2876
02:59:25,612 --> 02:59:28,652
ASHLY: Devan! Can I untie her, please?

2877
02:59:28,652 --> 02:59:33,799
TRAVIS: No. I turn towards the glass tank and I
hit it with the scimitar.

2878
02:59:33,799 --> 02:59:37,524
LIAM: Yeah, you also take your hilt and (glass
breaking).

2879
02:59:37,524 --> 02:59:42,726
TRAVIS: She's lying on the ground, right? The
water's hitting her?

2880
02:59:42,726 --> 02:59:47,528
LIAM: Yeah, all over her. Fish are hitting the
ground, flapping around on the ground.

2881
02:59:47,528 --> 02:59:50,319
TRAVIS: I walk over to her. I stand right over
her.

2882
02:59:50,319 --> 02:59:51,482
LIAM: Yeah.

2883
02:59:51,482 --> 02:59:53,494
TRAVIS: I thought you'd been here before? You
didn't know that was going to happen?

2884
02:59:53,494 --> 02:59:56,925
LIAM: You've actually never been in this room.

2885
02:59:56,925 --> 02:59:58,824
LAURA: I've never been in this room.

2886
02:59:58,824 --> 03:00:00,642
MARY: You were in the hallway, though, before.

2887
03:00:00,642 --> 03:00:05,003
LAURA: Yeah. And I told you guys to look for a
wall sconce, and then you marched me down the

2888
03:00:05,003 --> 03:00:06,270
hallway.

2889
03:00:06,270 --> 03:00:08,680
MARY: Let's do it again.

2890
03:00:08,680 --> 03:00:09,915
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2891
03:00:09,915 --> 03:00:13,596
MARY: All right. Anything else in this room?

2892
03:00:13,596 --> 03:00:15,005
LIAM: In this room?

2893
03:00:15,005 --> 03:00:15,950
MARY: Yeah.

2894
03:00:15,950 --> 03:00:17,425
LIAM: Have a look around if you'd like.

2895
03:00:17,425 --> 03:00:18,858
MARY: I'd like to look around the room.

2896
03:00:18,858 --> 03:00:20,303
LIAM: Perception check, please.

2897
03:00:20,303 --> 03:00:32,279
MARY: I'd like to roll a perception check, please.
I'll roll this die. It's a-- That

2898
03:00:32,279 --> 03:00:33,545
would be 18.

2899
03:00:33,545 --> 03:00:41,113
LIAM: Okay, you perception all the slowly dying
beautiful but poisonous fish in here and look

2900
03:00:41,113 --> 03:00:46,456
around, the room is empty except for this fucking
thing. You don't see anything else.

2901
03:00:46,456 --> 03:00:48,792
MARY: Right, there's nothing else, let's go.

2902
03:00:48,792 --> 03:00:51,164
ASHLY: Can I stealthily give Devan one of my
potions?

2903
03:00:51,164 --> 03:00:54,127
LIAM: Roll and I'll tell you if you can.

2904
03:00:54,127 --> 03:00:56,642
ASHLY: 14.

2905
03:00:56,642 --> 03:00:58,055
LIAM: Yes.

2906
03:00:58,055 --> 03:01:00,833
LAURA: Gulp, gulp, gulp.

2907
03:01:00,833 --> 03:01:02,612
LIAM: Oh, you mean, feed it to her.

2908
03:01:02,612 --> 03:01:03,452
ASHLY: Yeah.

2909
03:01:03,452 --> 03:01:04,695
LIAM: Oh yeah, sure.

2910
03:01:04,695 --> 03:01:07,456
TRAVIS: Does nobody notice this?

2911
03:01:07,456 --> 03:01:11,796
LIAM: So what happens is Dren crouches down and
slowly pours it in, and then when she feels like

2912
03:01:11,796 --> 03:01:14,744
someone's looked she goes (slaps) across the
face.

2913
03:01:14,744 --> 03:01:16,293
LAURA: Ow!

2914
03:01:16,293 --> 03:01:17,762
MARY: How much damage does she take from the
slap?

2915
03:01:17,762 --> 03:01:18,959
LIAM: Never again.

2916
03:01:18,959 --> 03:01:20,249
TRAVIS: Now you're getting the idea, Dren.

2917
03:01:20,249 --> 03:01:21,876
ASHLY: How much does she get back?

2918
03:01:21,876 --> 03:01:26,141
LIAM: Well, it's all on your character sheets. It
depends on which one you gave her. You guys have

2919
03:01:26,141 --> 03:01:27,694
one superior and two greater.

2920
03:01:27,694 --> 03:01:29,940
ASHLY: I give you greater.

2921
03:01:29,940 --> 03:01:33,233
LIAM: The big hitter is 8d4 plus eight. The
two smaller are 4d4--

2922
03:01:33,233 --> 03:01:34,757
LAURA: Should I roll or does she roll?

2923
03:01:34,757 --> 03:01:36,263
LIAM: Doesn't matter.

2924
03:01:36,263 --> 03:01:45,704
MARY: (singing) Every night in my dreams--

2925
03:01:45,704 --> 03:01:48,260
TRAVIS and MARY: (singing) I see you--

2926
03:01:48,260 --> 03:01:49,313
LAURA: That's great!

2927
03:01:49,313 --> 03:01:50,385
ASHLY: Yeah!

2928
03:01:50,385 --> 03:01:52,260
LIAM: I like the idea of this elf and this half
orc singing.

2929
03:01:52,260 --> 03:01:54,466
(laughter)

2930
03:01:54,466 --> 03:02:00,330
SAM: Why did we come in this room again?

2931
03:02:00,330 --> 03:02:02,014
MARY: We had to, to save her.

2932
03:02:02,014 --> 03:02:07,109
SAM: No, I mean the magic room. Why are we here?
There's no big jewel here. We're here for jewel.

2933
03:02:07,109 --> 03:02:13,296
LAURA: There's a door that opens if you do the
right things, and there's--

2934
03:02:13,296 --> 03:02:15,134
TRAVIS: You're not doing them.

2935
03:02:15,134 --> 03:02:22,875
LIAM: And Devan, you've never been in the room
you're in. But looking out the door of the room

2936
03:02:22,875 --> 03:02:28,336
you're in, you see, across the hall, a circular
"siggle."

2937
03:02:28,336 --> 03:02:29,709
MARY: "Siggle?"

2938
03:02:29,709 --> 03:02:31,675
LAURA: It's there!

2939
03:02:31,675 --> 03:02:32,761
TRAVIS: What's there?

2940
03:02:32,761 --> 03:02:33,761
LAURA: The room!

2941
03:02:33,761 --> 03:02:34,874
TRAVIS: The room?

2942
03:02:34,874 --> 03:02:36,910
LAURA: Jesus, Tarvis!

2943
03:02:36,910 --> 03:02:39,675
MARY: His first name isn't Jesus.

2944
03:02:39,675 --> 03:02:43,111
ASHLY: Oh, she needs to put her-- with the blood,
with the thing, on the thing!

2945
03:02:43,111 --> 03:02:46,296
TRAVIS: Oh, she doesn't need to do that. I
walk up and I cut her upper arm and get a bunch of

2946
03:02:46,296 --> 03:02:50,091
blood on my hand. And I walk over to the "siggle"
and place it on the--

2947
03:02:50,091 --> 03:02:52,751
LAURA: It's really a sigil, it's not actually a
"siggle."

2948
03:02:52,751 --> 03:02:56,333
TRAVIS: Well now you're making-- I'm confused.

2949
03:02:56,333 --> 03:03:04,263
LIAM: So you hold your hand there, and blood,
someone else's blood smears on. You wait, and you

2950
03:03:04,263 --> 03:03:09,666
wait, and that ain't doing shit.

2951
03:03:09,666 --> 03:03:12,998
ASHLY: I feel like we need to let her use
her hand.

2952
03:03:12,998 --> 03:03:18,477
MARY: I lift her up. How high up is it from the
floor?

2953
03:03:18,477 --> 03:03:20,258
LAURA: I really don't understand why you don't
want me to have my hands. What are you afraid I'm

2954
03:03:20,258 --> 03:03:21,230
going to do?

2955
03:03:21,230 --> 03:03:22,242
LIAM: Three feet.

2956
03:03:22,242 --> 03:03:24,697
MARY: Three feet. I lift her up, march her over, I
turn her around, I slit her hand, and I push her

2957
03:03:24,697 --> 03:03:26,706
up against it, hands still tied.

2958
03:03:26,706 --> 03:03:28,121
LIAM: Do you cast the spell?

2959
03:03:28,121 --> 03:03:31,096
LAURA: I don't think it works if I'm not free.

2960
03:03:31,096 --> 03:03:33,031
TRAVIS: Try.

2961
03:03:33,031 --> 03:03:36,079
LAURA: I'm trying. I can't get my hand on there
right.

2962
03:03:36,079 --> 03:03:37,726
MARY: I thought it was just blood and hands.

2963
03:03:37,726 --> 03:03:40,506
LAURA: Look, I can't get my hand on there right. I
can't twist it around.

2964
03:03:40,506 --> 03:03:41,975
ASHLY: She can't get her hand on there right.

2965
03:03:41,975 --> 03:03:46,512
TRAVIS: I walk up with one of the daggers and I
hold it right under her chin and I say try harder.

2966
03:03:46,512 --> 03:03:49,211
I push in a little. Try harder.

2967
03:03:49,211 --> 03:03:50,708
LAURA: (whispering) I'm trying real hard.

2968
03:03:50,708 --> 03:03:51,964
ASHLY: Guys, just for a second--

2969
03:03:51,964 --> 03:03:56,219
TRAVIS: Dren, shut up. Try harder.

2970
03:03:56,219 --> 03:04:00,207
SAM: Now would be a good time for a haiku.

2971
03:04:00,207 --> 03:04:03,110
LAURA: Can I have a haiku?

2972
03:04:03,110 --> 03:04:13,374
ASHLY: You can do it, my dear friend, Devan
Bluebutton. Please don't die now, please.

2973
03:04:13,374 --> 03:04:17,437
SAM: So inspiring.

2974
03:04:17,437 --> 03:04:22,473
LAURA: I feel inspired. I didn't know you thought
I was your friend, that's great!

2975
03:04:22,473 --> 03:04:24,499
ASHLY: Yeah.

2976
03:04:24,499 --> 03:04:26,533
LAURA: I'm trying. I'm trying.

2977
03:04:26,533 --> 03:04:34,338
LIAM: You can cast that cantrip. Okay, so it
takes a little bit of time, 20-30 seconds, held

2978
03:04:34,338 --> 03:04:38,381
up, hoisted in the air by an elf assassin, with
your hand bleeding out.

2979
03:04:38,381 --> 03:04:42,600
LAURA: Seriously, while this is happening, you
guys, I don't understand why you think I need to

2980
03:04:42,600 --> 03:04:44,179
think I have my hands tied.

2981
03:04:44,179 --> 03:04:45,729
TRAVIS: I don't understand why you're still
talking.

2982
03:04:45,729 --> 03:04:49,603
LAURA: You guys are the sneaky ones. I'm just here
to help. I'm just here to help!

2983
03:04:49,603 --> 03:04:50,870
LIAM: Click!

2984
03:04:50,870 --> 03:04:52,008
SAM: Hey!

2985
03:04:52,008 --> 03:04:57,094
MARY: See how well that worked? Patience is key,
right? Patience.

2986
03:04:57,094 --> 03:04:58,537
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

2987
03:04:58,537 --> 03:05:02,283
MARY: Door opens? What do we see?

2988
03:05:02,283 --> 03:05:11,667
LIAM: The wooden door opens outward, and you look
in and see a very well-lit room. A round room,

2989
03:05:11,667 --> 03:05:22,015
perfectly round. The walls are made up of curved
segments of dark, burnished metal. The walls go up

2990
03:05:22,015 --> 03:05:30,141
about 30 feet before curving in and up, very high.
It's almost like you're in the inside of a silo.

2991
03:05:30,141 --> 03:05:39,482
You guys cased this joint from the outside. There
is a bit of a tower on this side of it. This has

2992
03:05:39,482 --> 03:05:50,880
got to be that. Four of those golden orbs are
hanging and lighting up this room. You look up. It

2993
03:05:50,880 --> 03:05:57,025
goes very high. You can see down here and it gets
darker and darker the higher you go. You can't see

2994
03:05:57,025 --> 03:06:08,446
the peak. Across from where you entered, made out
of the same metal, is a pair of flat doors with

2995
03:06:08,446 --> 03:06:19,461
the same circle printed into the metal. Like a
cabinet, directly across.

2996
03:06:19,461 --> 03:06:22,798
TRAVIS: No furniture or anything in the room?

2997
03:06:22,798 --> 03:06:24,258
LIAM: Nothing in here.

2998
03:06:24,258 --> 03:06:26,106
TRAVIS: What is the floor made of?

2999
03:06:26,106 --> 03:06:36,559
LIAM: The floor is also metal. In the center of
the room is a smaller circle that's about a foot

3000
03:06:36,559 --> 03:06:43,662
and a half wide, and it's got a spiraling out
flower shape.

3001
03:06:43,662 --> 03:06:53,308
TRAVIS: Well, we found your room. What happens in
here? I don't see a gem.

3002
03:06:53,308 --> 03:06:55,729
LAURA: I don't see anything. I'm facing the wrong
direction.

3003
03:06:55,729 --> 03:06:57,635
MARY: I turn you around.

3004
03:06:57,635 --> 03:07:03,025
LIAM: There's the room that she took you to. This
is room where your grandmother showed you how to

3005
03:07:03,025 --> 03:07:12,105
create illusions and how to pull moisture from the
air to create shards of ice and use them.

3006
03:07:12,105 --> 03:07:14,504
LAURA: Yep.

3007
03:07:14,504 --> 03:07:22,662
SAM: Sounds like a pretty special woman. I think
you should be grateful to have a grandmother like her.

3008
03:07:22,662 --> 03:07:26,398
LAURA: (laughs) I think she would like you a lot.

3009
03:07:26,398 --> 03:07:28,223
SAM: Family is very important.

3010
03:07:28,223 --> 03:07:31,701
MARY: So what do we do?

3011
03:07:31,701 --> 03:07:34,380
LAURA: I don't know. There's another rat over
there.

3012
03:07:34,380 --> 03:07:42,180
MARY: What's in this room? What's in the center of
the room? What is it? That circular, beautiful,

3013
03:07:42,180 --> 03:07:45,579
spiraling outward, floral thing?

3014
03:07:45,579 --> 03:07:47,197
LAURA: I don't know.

3015
03:07:47,197 --> 03:07:48,677
MARY: You never used it?

3016
03:07:48,677 --> 03:07:51,188
TRAVIS: I'd like to insight check her. Does she
know?

3017
03:07:51,188 --> 03:07:53,147
LIAM: Roll for insight.

3018
03:07:53,147 --> 03:07:59,000
TRAVIS: 18.

3019
03:07:59,000 --> 03:08:06,554
LIAM: I'm going to call it for her. She appears
flustered and a bit of a doofus, but she seems

3020
03:08:06,554 --> 03:08:08,705
like she's telling the truth.

3021
03:08:08,705 --> 03:08:14,684
SAM: The circle in the middle of the room is a
foot and a half wide? How big was the brass

3022
03:08:14,684 --> 03:08:16,289
column?

3023
03:08:16,289 --> 03:08:18,114
LIAM: A foot and a half wide

3024
03:08:18,114 --> 03:08:23,165
MARY: (yelling) What? (whispering) Go investigate
it.

3025
03:08:23,165 --> 03:08:28,187
SAM: I'm going to go take a look at that without
standing on top of it or touching the flowery stuff.

3026
03:08:28,187 --> 03:08:35,007
LAURA: While he's doing that, can I message Dren?

3027
03:08:35,007 --> 03:08:37,555
LIAM: Sure, hold that thought.

3028
03:08:37,555 --> 03:08:39,398
SAM: 14. Not too great.

3029
03:08:39,398 --> 03:08:41,757
LIAM: Are you willing to touch it at all?

3030
03:08:41,757 --> 03:08:43,297
SAM: Oh boy.

3031
03:08:43,297 --> 03:08:45,737
(laughter)

3032
03:08:45,737 --> 03:08:55,637
SAM: No, looking for any signs that it could open
or be a door. Hinges.

3033
03:08:55,637 --> 03:09:03,092
LIAM: It's not like an etching, like that circular
sigil of a shrew over there. It does seem to be

3034
03:09:03,092 --> 03:09:11,999
made out of more than one piece. It's not a
decoration, but that's all you can tell.

3035
03:09:11,999 --> 03:09:16,263
MARY: What do you see?

3036
03:09:16,263 --> 03:09:25,064
SAM: There's something with this circle.
Something's under it. I don't know what, though.

3037
03:09:25,064 --> 03:09:27,129
LIAM: What's your formation in here, by the way?

3038
03:09:27,129 --> 03:09:30,633
TRAVIS: He's at the circle in the middle.

3039
03:09:30,633 --> 03:09:38,853
MARY: I'm behind Devan, still holding onto the
rope and my rapier. Oh, hello.

3040
03:09:38,853 --> 03:09:40,723
LIAM: Who's where?

3041
03:09:40,723 --> 03:09:42,477
LAURA: We're in the doorway, right?

3042
03:09:42,477 --> 03:09:44,299
MARY: We just took a few steps in.

3043
03:09:44,299 --> 03:09:48,902
TRAVIS: I'm halfway from Obby to the door.

3044
03:09:48,902 --> 03:09:52,668
LIAM: Who's got the gambling addict?

3045
03:09:52,668 --> 03:09:55,647
MARY: I do. She's in front of me.

3046
03:09:55,647 --> 03:09:57,081
LIAM: Where are you, Dren?

3047
03:09:57,081 --> 03:09:58,851
ASHLY: I think I'm just behind.

3048
03:09:58,851 --> 03:09:59,951
LIAM: Here?

3049
03:09:59,951 --> 03:10:01,063
ASHLY: Yeah.

3050
03:10:01,063 --> 03:10:04,836
MARY: Want to Mage Hand it? Want me to touch it?
What do you want? Want me to push down on it, see

3051
03:10:04,836 --> 03:10:05,943
what it can do?

3052
03:10:05,943 --> 03:10:07,498
SAM: Well if it's a monster, that would be bad.

3053
03:10:07,498 --> 03:10:15,809
LAURA: I want to message Dren, and say, I think
the jewel is in the cabinet on the other side of

3054
03:10:15,809 --> 03:10:17,445
the room.

3055
03:10:17,445 --> 03:10:19,279
ASHLY: It's in the other room. It's in the
cabinet?

3056
03:10:19,279 --> 03:10:21,131
LAURA: On the other side of the room. Just
remember--

3057
03:10:21,131 --> 03:10:22,842
LIAM: The cabinet doors are right here.

3058
03:10:22,842 --> 03:10:28,699
LAURA: These guys are tough. I think worst case
scenario, we should get it and go.

3059
03:10:28,699 --> 03:10:30,627
ASHLY: How are we going to get past them?

3060
03:10:30,627 --> 03:10:31,858
LAURA: I don't even know!

3061
03:10:31,858 --> 03:10:34,394
ASHLY: We need to get you down first.

3062
03:10:34,394 --> 03:10:37,092
LAURA: Loosen the ropes. See if you can loosen my
ropes.

3063
03:10:37,092 --> 03:10:41,412
ASHLY: I'm going to do a stealth. Try to do a
sleight of hand, is that what that was, to loosen

3064
03:10:41,412 --> 03:10:43,099
her ropes?

3065
03:10:43,099 --> 03:10:44,381
LIAM: Dexterity check.

3066
03:10:44,381 --> 03:10:45,298
ASHLY: Dexterity?

3067
03:10:45,298 --> 03:10:46,988
TRAVIS: You know that she is holding onto the
ropes.

3068
03:10:46,988 --> 03:10:47,979
MARY: Yeah.

3069
03:10:47,979 --> 03:10:50,149
LIAM: But you can still make a sleight of hand
check.

3070
03:10:50,149 --> 03:10:51,299
MARY: Give it a shot.

3071
03:10:51,299 --> 03:10:52,598
LIAM: Oh, sleight of hand, yes, sleight of hand.

3072
03:10:52,598 --> 03:10:53,854
ASHLY: Sleight of hand?

3073
03:10:53,854 --> 03:10:55,719
LAURA: While she's holding it? Jeez.

3074
03:10:55,719 --> 03:10:57,397
ASHLY: Why not! I'm brazen.

3075
03:10:57,397 --> 03:10:59,082
LIAM: At disadvantage.

3076
03:10:59,082 --> 03:11:00,532
ASHLY: At disadvantage?

3077
03:11:00,532 --> 03:11:04,065
LAURA: Oh, that was a good one. So roll it again.

3078
03:11:04,065 --> 03:11:05,568
LIAM: Got to roll it again.

3079
03:11:05,568 --> 03:11:07,331
LAURA: And take the lower. They were the same!

3080
03:11:07,331 --> 03:11:08,735
ASHLY: Were they?

3081
03:11:08,735 --> 03:11:10,227
LAURA: Yeah! They were both 16.

3082
03:11:10,227 --> 03:11:11,894
ASHLY: I thought one of them was six.

3083
03:11:11,894 --> 03:11:13,389
LAURA: No no no no, they were both 16.

3084
03:11:13,389 --> 03:11:14,811
ASHLY: They were both 16. Okay, so then 19.

3085
03:11:14,811 --> 03:11:20,097
LIAM: Okay. I'm going to say, Delweth, you were
staring up, trying to assess what was happening up top.

3086
03:11:20,097 --> 03:11:21,836
MARY: The shiny ceiling?

3087
03:11:21,836 --> 03:11:24,019
LIAM: You get her hands free.

3088
03:11:24,019 --> 03:11:25,232
ASHLY: Yes.

3089
03:11:25,232 --> 03:11:39,665
LIAM: At that moment, all of you hear the sound of
some sort of clank, very high, high above you. And

3090
03:11:39,665 --> 03:11:44,786
behind you, Dren, all of you, but you especially,
hear (metal slamming).

3091
03:11:44,786 --> 03:11:46,464
MARY: Oh, balls.

3092
03:11:46,464 --> 03:11:53,874
LIAM: And you look over your shoulder, and metal
barriers, or doors, or something, have suddenly

3093
03:11:53,874 --> 03:12:01,032
slammed shut. There's a thin seam between the two.
You guys are in here. And that's when you hear,

3094
03:12:01,032 --> 03:12:18,174
not in your ears, at the base of your skull,
inside your skull, "Not supposed to be here."

3095
03:12:18,174 --> 03:12:20,248
SAM: Is that your grandmother?

3096
03:12:20,248 --> 03:12:24,968
LAURA: If it is, her voice has changed.

3097
03:12:24,968 --> 03:12:28,985
LIAM: "Dogs, dogs, dogs."

3098
03:12:28,985 --> 03:12:30,722
LAURA: Dogs! Dogs! Shit!

3099
03:12:30,722 --> 03:12:39,346
LIAM: And then you hear, way high, at the apex of
this tower, a chime. "Ding."

3100
03:12:39,346 --> 03:12:42,740
LAURA: No!

3101
03:12:42,740 --> 03:12:44,021
ASHLY: Guys?

3102
03:12:44,021 --> 03:12:48,253
LIAM: (multiple fwooshing sounds)

3103
03:12:48,253 --> 03:12:49,745
TRAVIS: Five?

3104
03:12:49,745 --> 03:13:00,263
LIAM: Puffs of sparkling white and purple smoke
(fwoosh) to one side, to the other side, around

3105
03:13:00,263 --> 03:13:11,191
you suddenly. You're looking at four smoking,
misty, almost-hairless dogs. Angry looking,

3106
03:13:11,191 --> 03:13:23,295
slobbering. Three of a certain size, one much
larger, staring at you with glassy, milky white

3107
03:13:23,295 --> 03:13:30,146
eyes. It's big, it's muscular, it's ropey. And
they bare their teeth.

3108
03:13:30,146 --> 03:13:32,328
LAURA: I cast Minor Illusion.

3109
03:13:32,328 --> 03:13:33,679
SAM: Oh boy.

3110
03:13:33,679 --> 03:13:35,688
LAURA: Of my grandmother.

3111
03:13:35,688 --> 03:13:37,083
MARY: Oh!

3112
03:13:37,083 --> 03:13:39,487
LIAM: Okay.

3113
03:13:39,487 --> 03:13:41,539
LAURA: In front of me.

3114
03:13:41,539 --> 03:13:45,248
LIAM: Okay. Roll for initiative, everybody.

3115
03:13:45,248 --> 03:13:51,796
ASHLY: 13.

3116
03:13:51,796 --> 03:14:00,023
LIAM: Hold that thought, everybody. 13 is what you
rolled, Dren? Okay.

3117
03:14:00,023 --> 03:14:01,478
MARY: I did as well, 13.

3118
03:14:01,478 --> 03:14:03,121
LIAM: Okay.

3119
03:14:03,121 --> 03:14:04,480
TRAVIS: 16.

3120
03:14:04,480 --> 03:14:06,215
LIAM: 16, okay.

3121
03:14:06,215 --> 03:14:07,594
SAM: Obby rolls ten.

3122
03:14:07,594 --> 03:14:09,616
(snickers)

3123
03:14:09,616 --> 03:14:11,242
MARY: Do you know why?

3124
03:14:11,242 --> 03:14:13,447
LIAM: Roll initiative for me, too, Devan.

3125
03:14:13,447 --> 03:14:14,659
LAURA: 18.

3126
03:14:14,659 --> 03:14:20,465
LIAM: 18. All right. Then you are the first one
to go. Ooh, doo-loo-loo-loo! Okay.

3127
03:14:20,465 --> 03:14:27,373
SAM: Dogs all rolled 20s.

3128
03:14:27,373 --> 03:14:29,082
LAURA: (laughs)

3129
03:14:29,082 --> 03:14:37,108
LIAM: The idea flashes into your mind what to do.
You start to move your hands. The dogs lunge in on

3130
03:14:37,108 --> 03:14:42,342
all of you. The first one-- Oh hey, this music's too
chill.

3131
03:14:42,342 --> 03:14:46,575
TRAVIS: (laughs) I need more tension!

3132
03:14:46,575 --> 03:14:48,663
(music intensifies)

3133
03:14:48,663 --> 03:14:50,040
LAURA: There is it!

3134
03:14:50,040 --> 03:14:57,621
LIAM: This dog comes running toward you, and bites
into your arm, maybe?

3135
03:14:57,621 --> 03:14:58,757
LAURA: My arm?

3136
03:14:58,757 --> 03:14:59,862
SAM: Who, who's that, who's biting?

3137
03:14:59,862 --> 03:15:00,833
LIAM: What's your AC?

3138
03:15:00,833 --> 03:15:01,904
LAURA: 11.

3139
03:15:01,904 --> 03:15:09,030
LIAM: 11? Yes. Its teeth sink into your arm as you
start to cast and you take, oh, just two points of

3140
03:15:09,030 --> 03:15:11,986
damage. And the spell is gone.

3141
03:15:11,986 --> 03:15:14,535
LAURA: What spell? I didn't get to cast anything.

3142
03:15:14,535 --> 03:15:16,167
MARY: You did. The Minor Illusion.

3143
03:15:16,167 --> 03:15:21,034
LIAM: Yeah, I'm going to say it was so close. This
is within six seconds of each other. That's gone.

3144
03:15:21,034 --> 03:15:29,587
This dog rushes, does the same thing for you,
Obby. What's your armor class?

3145
03:15:29,587 --> 03:15:30,792
SAM: 16.

3146
03:15:30,792 --> 03:15:42,520
LIAM: You feel teeth sink into your thigh, and you
take five points of piercing damage. This dog goes

3147
03:15:42,520 --> 03:15:48,854
(whoosh noise) and is gone. (whoosh noise) He is
right behind you, Delweth, and what's your armor class?

3148
03:15:48,854 --> 03:15:50,599
MARY: 14.

3149
03:15:50,599 --> 03:15:58,518
LIAM: You feel teeth sink into your gut, on the
side. You take three points of piercing damage, and

3150
03:15:58,518 --> 03:16:08,844
the big one (snarling noise) lunges in to attack
you, Tarvis, and you feel teeth sink into the back

3151
03:16:08,844 --> 03:16:15,909
of your calf and take five hit points in piercing
damage. Tears away, and you feel part of your calf

3152
03:16:15,909 --> 03:16:17,111
come away.

3153
03:16:17,111 --> 03:16:18,108
TRAVIS: Aw shit.

3154
03:16:18,108 --> 03:16:24,619
LIAM: Devan, you may try something else.

3155
03:16:24,619 --> 03:16:26,016
LAURA: Try that again?

3156
03:16:26,016 --> 03:16:28,132
LIAM: Sure.

3157
03:16:28,132 --> 03:16:40,802
LAURA: I'm going to try Minor Illusion. And make
it look like my grandma now behind me. In front of me.

3158
03:16:40,802 --> 03:16:45,117
LIAM: I don't know if your grandmother qualifies
as an object.

3159
03:16:45,117 --> 03:16:46,994
LAURA: Oh, it has to be an object?

3160
03:16:46,994 --> 03:16:48,906
LIAM: Object within range.

3161
03:16:48,906 --> 03:16:50,742
SAM: Minor Illusion?

3162
03:16:50,742 --> 03:16:55,187
LAURA: A sound or an image of an object. You're
right, okay. All right.

3163
03:16:55,187 --> 03:16:57,482
LIAM: I'll let you do something else.

3164
03:16:57,482 --> 03:17:05,378
LAURA: All right, then I'm going to cast Chromatic
Orb.

3165
03:17:05,378 --> 03:17:11,192
LIAM: Okay, all right. Where's it going?

3166
03:17:11,192 --> 03:17:12,815
LAURA: Wait!

3167
03:17:12,815 --> 03:17:17,016
LIAM: This is your second level one, right?

3168
03:17:17,016 --> 03:17:25,510
LAURA: Yes. Yes, I'm going to cast Chromatic Orb
at the dog that's biting me.

3169
03:17:25,510 --> 03:17:26,899
LIAM: Yeah, yeah.

3170
03:17:26,899 --> 03:17:28,462
LAURA: And I'm going to do--

3171
03:17:28,462 --> 03:17:30,410
LIAM: Make a ranged spell attack.

3172
03:17:30,410 --> 03:17:34,572
LAURA: Oh, so I'm going to do it at the big dog
attacking Tarvis then.

3173
03:17:34,572 --> 03:17:35,893
LIAM: Okay, go for it.

3174
03:17:35,893 --> 03:17:40,149
LAURA: And I'm going to do it as a thunder
attack.

3175
03:17:40,149 --> 03:17:41,557
LIAM: Okay.

3176
03:17:41,557 --> 03:17:48,516
LAURA: That probably doesn't hit though. What's my
spell?

3177
03:17:48,516 --> 03:17:55,477
LIAM: Oh, man, it's on your sheet. On page number
two, it is plus six on ranged attacks.

3178
03:17:55,477 --> 03:17:59,740
LAURA: Oh, okay. So that's what I rolled. Ten.

3179
03:17:59,740 --> 03:18:00,841
LIAM: Ten?

3180
03:18:00,841 --> 03:18:02,182
LAURA: Oh. Nine.

3181
03:18:02,182 --> 03:18:08,233
LIAM: Okay. A ball of crackling energy goes
(whoosh noise) misses the dog entirely, goes

3182
03:18:08,233 --> 03:18:13,139
(impact noise) ricochets like a pinball off the
side of the wall and arcs up, and then (impact

3183
03:18:13,139 --> 03:18:17,370
noise) diffuses high up in the air. You can still
move if you want.

3184
03:18:17,370 --> 03:18:26,525
LAURA: All right, I'm going to back up behind--
who's next to me? Delweth?

3185
03:18:26,525 --> 03:18:28,374
LIAM: Delweth, yeah.

3186
03:18:28,374 --> 03:18:29,786
LAURA: I'm going to stand behind Delweth.

3187
03:18:29,786 --> 03:18:31,136
LIAM: Where you going to go? Over here?

3188
03:18:31,136 --> 03:18:32,019
LAURA: Yeah.

3189
03:18:32,019 --> 03:18:34,291
LIAM: You're going to walk there? Or run there?

3190
03:18:34,291 --> 03:18:35,368
LAURA: I'm going to dart under her legs.

3191
03:18:35,368 --> 03:18:39,694
LIAM: Dart under her legs? Okay, you start to move
under. The dog behind you sees you go, and--

3192
03:18:39,694 --> 03:18:41,151
what's your armor class?

3193
03:18:41,151 --> 03:18:42,131
LAURA: 11.

3194
03:18:42,131 --> 03:18:45,460
LIAM: 11. Yeah, bites into your back.

3195
03:18:45,460 --> 03:18:46,497
LAURA: Ow!

3196
03:18:46,497 --> 03:18:50,631
LIAM: And you feel part of your robes rip away,
and you take five points of piercing damage and you

3197
03:18:50,631 --> 03:18:51,704
get over here.

3198
03:18:51,704 --> 03:18:59,512
LAURA: Yikes! All right, I want to like stay under
her legs, basically.

3199
03:18:59,512 --> 03:19:02,789
LIAM: Okay. Oh, so you're sharing the space with
her?

3200
03:19:02,789 --> 03:19:03,689
LAURA: Yeah.

3201
03:19:03,689 --> 03:19:07,370
LIAM: Okay. Okay, and now it is Tarvis' turn, what
would you like to do?

3202
03:19:07,370 --> 03:19:11,770
TRAVIS: I see we have three daggers. Does that mean we
can do like the famous rogue, Vax, and dagger

3203
03:19:11,770 --> 03:19:12,877
dagger dagger?

3204
03:19:12,877 --> 03:19:14,871
MARY: No, that's what I asked him when we got
here.

3205
03:19:14,871 --> 03:19:22,352
LIAM: You need boots of haste and the feat Dual
Wielding to do that.

3206
03:19:22,352 --> 03:19:26,133
TRAVIS: I take my scimitar with its one trusty hit
today.

3207
03:19:26,133 --> 03:19:27,133
LIAM: Yeah.

3208
03:19:27,133 --> 03:19:32,549
TRAVIS: And I swing at White Fang there.

3209
03:19:32,549 --> 03:19:34,965
LIAM: Okay, all right, roll to hit.

3210
03:19:34,965 --> 03:19:43,489
TRAVIS: Natural 20. Hey, finally! Which means I
also get the savage attack crit.

3211
03:19:43,489 --> 03:19:44,806
LIAM: Yes, it does.

3212
03:19:44,806 --> 03:19:45,846
SAM: Savage attack?

3213
03:19:45,846 --> 03:19:46,707
MARY: Savage.

3214
03:19:46,707 --> 03:19:51,517
TRAVIS: That's just savage. That's a three plus
three is six. Which means I get an extra damage

3215
03:19:51,517 --> 03:19:55,817
die, which is a four, for a whopping ten.

3216
03:19:55,817 --> 03:19:59,344
SAM: Is it near a thing, do you get a sneaky,
sneaky? You get a sneaky?

3217
03:19:59,344 --> 03:20:01,215
LIAM: Yes.

3218
03:20:01,215 --> 03:20:02,935
TRAVIS: I do?

3219
03:20:02,935 --> 03:20:07,083
LIAM: Yeah, from Obby. I mean, this fixes that.

3220
03:20:07,083 --> 03:20:09,591
TRAVIS: 2d6. So 18.

3221
03:20:09,591 --> 03:20:16,192
LIAM: 18? You pull out the blade, the curved
blade, and it sort of sings as you spin it in the air,

3222
03:20:16,192 --> 03:20:23,419
and bring it down in a slice, and it cuts into the
ribs of this dog. And the dog yelps, loud, and

3223
03:20:23,419 --> 03:20:32,779
sort of buckles down for a bit. And has murder in
its mouth and its blind eyes. What was the total

3224
03:20:32,779 --> 03:20:33,658
on that?

3225
03:20:33,658 --> 03:20:34,526
TRAVIS: 18.

3226
03:20:34,526 --> 03:20:35,434
LIAM: 18.

3227
03:20:35,434 --> 03:20:36,889
LAURA: Its blind eyes? It's blind?

3228
03:20:36,889 --> 03:20:37,697
LIAM: Looks like it.

3229
03:20:37,697 --> 03:20:38,621
LAURA: Oh.

3230
03:20:38,621 --> 03:20:41,137
LIAM: All right, now it is Dren's turn.

3231
03:20:41,137 --> 03:20:46,149
ASHLY: I can like call to Devan as like a thing,
right?

3232
03:20:46,149 --> 03:20:47,853
LIAM: You can do that, plus your attack roll.

3233
03:20:47,853 --> 03:20:50,849
ASHLY: Okay. Do you know anything about this sigil
in the middle? Is it open?

3234
03:20:50,849 --> 03:20:52,691
LIAM: Got to be six seconds of dialogue, though.

3235
03:20:52,691 --> 03:20:55,712
LAURA: I don't know anything about it.

3236
03:20:55,712 --> 03:21:00,491
ASHLY: Okay, I'm going to fight then. Let's see,
is that a dog right next to me?

3237
03:21:00,491 --> 03:21:01,846
SAM: They're all dogs.

3238
03:21:01,846 --> 03:21:08,687
ASHLY: So that guy is a dog? Okay, okay. So no
sneak attack for Dren for that guy, he knows I'm there?

3239
03:21:08,687 --> 03:21:10,441
LIAM: You do have sneak attack on this one.

3240
03:21:10,441 --> 03:21:12,719
ASHLY: But also potentially the big guy?

3241
03:21:12,719 --> 03:21:14,018
LAURA: Yeah.

3242
03:21:14,018 --> 03:21:15,869
LIAM: If you throw something, yeah.

3243
03:21:15,869 --> 03:21:16,889
ASHLY: If I do a crossbow?

3244
03:21:16,889 --> 03:21:18,328
LIAM: Or use your crossbow, sure.

3245
03:21:18,328 --> 03:21:21,953
ASHLY: I guess I might as well--

3246
03:21:21,953 --> 03:21:23,636
LIAM: Six more seconds to decide it.

3247
03:21:23,636 --> 03:21:27,458
ASHLY: I'm going to attack the guy right next to
me actually.

3248
03:21:27,458 --> 03:21:28,441
LIAM: Okay, go for it.

3249
03:21:28,441 --> 03:21:34,682
ASHLY: Okay. With my shortsword. 15?

3250
03:21:34,682 --> 03:21:36,847
LIAM: Ah, yeah, that hits.

3251
03:21:36,847 --> 03:21:38,534
ASHLY: Okay. And is that sneak attack?

3252
03:21:38,534 --> 03:21:41,058
LIAM: Ah, yes it is. Because of the crowd here.

3253
03:21:41,058 --> 03:21:43,510
ASHLY: So that's one, and then eight.

3254
03:21:43,510 --> 03:21:44,776
LAURA: That's good.

3255
03:21:44,776 --> 03:21:46,080
LIAM: Eight? Okay.

3256
03:21:46,080 --> 03:21:47,131
ASHLY: To the dog adjacent to me.

3257
03:21:47,131 --> 03:21:49,589
LAURA: Roll plus four. You didn't add that four.

3258
03:21:49,589 --> 03:21:50,963
ASHLY: Oh! Plus four.

3259
03:21:50,963 --> 03:21:51,900
LIAM: 14?

3260
03:21:51,900 --> 03:21:53,430
LAURA: So it's 12 total.

3261
03:21:53,430 --> 03:21:58,100
LIAM: Math in my head. All right, great, and that
was which weapon? Your shortsword?

3262
03:21:58,100 --> 03:21:59,064
ASHLY: My shortsword.

3263
03:21:59,064 --> 03:22:03,970
LIAM: Okay. You squat down, almost do a little
ballerina split, and then stick your sword up into

3264
03:22:03,970 --> 03:22:11,012
its gut from underneath. And the dog goes (yelp of
pain), underneath, and snarls through. And now

3265
03:22:11,012 --> 03:22:12,119
we're on to-

3266
03:22:12,119 --> 03:22:13,154
ASHLY: Do I get a bonus action?

3267
03:22:13,154 --> 03:22:13,982
LIAM: Yes, you do.

3268
03:22:13,982 --> 03:22:21,723
ASHLY: Okay. I'm going to dash behind Tarvis? Can
I make it there?

3269
03:22:21,723 --> 03:22:22,858
LIAM: You're going to go here?

3270
03:22:22,858 --> 03:22:25,887
ASHLY: Yeah. Can I get to the other side of him?
No?

3271
03:22:25,887 --> 03:22:28,692
LIAM: You can do that. You're tiny, too. Yeah, you
can get through-- where do you want to go, here?

3272
03:22:28,692 --> 03:22:29,799
ASHLY: Yeah.

3273
03:22:29,799 --> 03:22:31,073
LIAM: Yeah. I'll say you can do that.

3274
03:22:31,073 --> 03:22:31,783
ASHLY: Okay.

3275
03:22:31,783 --> 03:22:32,958
LIAM: Because of how small you are and how big he
is.

3276
03:22:32,958 --> 03:22:33,820
ASHLY: Okay.

3277
03:22:33,820 --> 03:22:38,015
LIAM: Okay. So you start to run and this dog that
you stabbed sees you running, sees your back, and

3278
03:22:38,015 --> 03:22:41,832
lunges at it. But you're too quick, and it goes
(noise of jaws snapping shut) as you slide

3279
03:22:41,832 --> 03:22:43,550
underneath Tarvis' legs.

3280
03:22:43,550 --> 03:22:44,857
ASHLY: Nice. Yes.

3281
03:22:44,857 --> 03:22:48,367
LIAM: Pop out here at the end of your turn.
Delweth, you are up.

3282
03:22:48,367 --> 03:22:52,758
MARY: I'm going to try Poison Spray on White Fang.

3283
03:22:52,758 --> 03:22:53,763
LIAM: All right.

3284
03:22:53,763 --> 03:22:55,842
MARY: What do I do, I roll--?

3285
03:22:55,842 --> 03:23:01,223
LIAM: Oh, I do it. What's your spell DC? It's the
numbers near the top of your--

3286
03:23:01,223 --> 03:23:02,466
MARY: 13.

3287
03:23:02,466 --> 03:23:04,653
LIAM: Fails.

3288
03:23:04,653 --> 03:23:05,710
TRAVIS: Nice!

3289
03:23:05,710 --> 03:23:06,775
MARY: All right, so what do I do?

3290
03:23:06,775 --> 03:23:08,012
LIAM: 1d12.

3291
03:23:08,012 --> 03:23:10,541
MARY: 1d12. Which one's a d12?

3292
03:23:10,541 --> 03:23:11,894
TRAVIS: This guy.

3293
03:23:11,894 --> 03:23:14,454
SAM: Trusty d12.

3294
03:23:14,454 --> 03:23:17,734
MARY: Two.

3295
03:23:17,734 --> 03:23:19,425
LIAM: Two? Okay.

3296
03:23:19,425 --> 03:23:21,234
MARY: Plus nothing.

3297
03:23:21,234 --> 03:23:23,794
LIAM: Plus nothing. But that noxious odor--

3298
03:23:23,794 --> 03:23:26,438
MARY: Sneak attack? Sneak attack?

3299
03:23:26,438 --> 03:23:33,575
LIAM: No sneak attack. But it floats into this old
blind bastard's face and goes (choking and

3300
03:23:33,575 --> 03:23:42,237
snarling) and it's blind, but it looks in your
direction and snarls. Did you want to do anything else?

3301
03:23:42,237 --> 03:23:48,115
MARY: I would like to disengage and go hide
behind--

3302
03:23:48,115 --> 03:23:50,340
TRAVIS: Hide behind Devan?

3303
03:23:50,340 --> 03:23:52,490
MARY: I would like to go behind White Fang.

3304
03:23:52,490 --> 03:23:54,550
LIAM: You're going over this way?

3305
03:23:54,550 --> 03:23:55,512
MARY: Yep.

3306
03:23:55,512 --> 03:23:59,306
LIAM: All right, as you go this dog, who's biting
people's backs today sees you go, and a little tip

3307
03:23:59,306 --> 03:24:00,690
to all you newer players--

3308
03:24:00,690 --> 03:24:01,867
TRAVIS: She disengaged, though, right?

3309
03:24:01,867 --> 03:24:02,825
LIAM: Oh, you disengaged, you're right.

3310
03:24:02,825 --> 03:24:03,878
MARY: Disengage, motherfucka!

3311
03:24:03,878 --> 03:24:06,825
LIAM: Yeah, you go (blip noises). Great, thank
you.

3312
03:24:06,825 --> 03:24:08,171
LAURA: No, but I was hiding!

3313
03:24:08,171 --> 03:24:13,822
LIAM: Thank you, thank you for that. And now we
are on to Obby the Rat.

3314
03:24:13,822 --> 03:24:17,054
SAM: I attack the big dog with a dagger.

3315
03:24:17,054 --> 03:24:18,114
LIAM: Yeah.

3316
03:24:18,114 --> 03:24:20,058
SAM: I get him. It's a 22.

3317
03:24:20,058 --> 03:24:22,545
LIAM: That hits. And you have sneak attack damage
on this.

3318
03:24:22,545 --> 03:24:23,775
SAM: Three.

3319
03:24:23,775 --> 03:24:27,104
LIAM: I'm even going to say you have advantage
on-- well you already hit, though, right?

3320
03:24:27,104 --> 03:24:29,596
SAM: Eight. Plus nine. 17.

3321
03:24:29,596 --> 03:24:39,171
LIAM: Oh my god. You come in low with your knife
and stick it in right under one of its legs and

3322
03:24:39,171 --> 03:24:43,919
then slide all the way down the length of its
body. And you see one noodle of intestine go

3323
03:24:43,919 --> 03:24:45,797
(splurting noise) out the side of it.

3324
03:24:45,797 --> 03:24:46,892
TRAVIS: Yes!

3325
03:24:46,892 --> 03:24:48,465
LIAM: Want to do anything else?

3326
03:24:48,465 --> 03:24:49,366
ASHLY: It's still alive?

3327
03:24:49,366 --> 03:24:55,287
SAM: I say to it, do you know why they call me
Obby the Rat? Because Obby is actually short for

3328
03:24:55,287 --> 03:25:00,252
Obenthal. It's a nickname. And then I'm using my
bonus action.

3329
03:25:00,252 --> 03:25:08,190
I will use sleight of hand to jam my fucking
crowbar, that I recovered from the dude, into the

3330
03:25:08,190 --> 03:25:10,999
floor to try to open the circle on the floor.

3331
03:25:10,999 --> 03:25:14,294
LIAM: Make a dexterity check.

3332
03:25:14,294 --> 03:25:16,883
SAM: 20.

3333
03:25:16,883 --> 03:25:24,286
LIAM: It glances off of this thing. It wasn't a
natural 20, right?

3334
03:25:24,286 --> 03:25:26,094
SAM: No, it was a 13 plus a seven.

3335
03:25:26,094 --> 03:25:33,765
LIAM: It glances off of it. That is the time when,
in the back of your brain, you hear (gurgling noises).

3336
03:25:33,765 --> 03:25:35,136
LAURA: Oh shit.

3337
03:25:35,136 --> 03:25:47,057
LIAM: Delweth. You, freaking out, look up and see
a bulbous, green--

3338
03:25:47,057 --> 03:25:49,128
LAURA: Oh god, we're going to die.

3339
03:25:49,128 --> 03:25:50,384
ASHLY: Ah shit.

3340
03:25:50,384 --> 03:25:58,906
LIAM: Slowly down out of the tower, in a fucking
weird sight. I don't know what the fuck this is.

3341
03:25:58,906 --> 03:26:00,434
Something coming down.

3342
03:26:00,434 --> 03:26:01,756
LAURA: What?

3343
03:26:01,756 --> 03:26:04,262
MARY: We're are all going to die. There's
something coming from the ceiling!

3344
03:26:04,262 --> 03:26:06,020
LIAM: (gurgling noises)

3345
03:26:06,020 --> 03:26:07,911
MARY: And it--

3346
03:26:07,911 --> 03:26:08,918
SAM: It's Sylvia Plath.

3347
03:26:08,918 --> 03:26:10,073
MARY: Sylvia Plath.

3348
03:26:10,073 --> 03:26:13,457
LIAM: And give me one moment please.

3349
03:26:13,457 --> 03:26:15,674
ASHLY: I almost said something really mean.

3350
03:26:15,674 --> 03:26:18,673
SAM: About Sylvia Plath? What did she ever do to
you?

3351
03:26:18,673 --> 03:26:20,542
ASHLY: She'll kill herself, so it's fine.

3352
03:26:20,542 --> 03:26:23,802
(groans)

3353
03:26:23,802 --> 03:26:29,578
ASHLY: (singing) Sorry, everybody at home. I'm
Ashly Burch and that's all for today.

3354
03:26:29,578 --> 03:26:32,523
MARY: Haiku that. We need a haiku for that.

3355
03:26:32,523 --> 03:26:34,982
(laughter)

3356
03:26:34,982 --> 03:26:37,645
LIAM: Delweth, I need you to make a constitution
save right now.

3357
03:26:37,645 --> 03:26:44,392
MARY: Oh, balls. All right, 18.

3358
03:26:44,392 --> 03:26:54,540
LIAM: Okay, you guys see a ray of blackish-gray
light go (thrumming sound) down from the ceiling

3359
03:26:54,540 --> 03:27:00,230
and cut along the floor right past you. But you
slide back against the wall and it misses you just

3360
03:27:00,230 --> 03:27:08,328
in time. And now it is time for the dogs.

3361
03:27:08,328 --> 03:27:09,882
ASHLY: Oh, not the dogs.

3362
03:27:09,882 --> 03:27:17,313
LIAM: So this one turns towards Devan and snaps
angrily. But Devan, scared to death, freaks out

3363
03:27:17,313 --> 03:27:19,071
and does this and it misses because of it.

3364
03:27:19,071 --> 03:27:20,863
(laughter)

3365
03:27:20,863 --> 03:27:23,666
MARY: With grace and style.

3366
03:27:23,666 --> 03:27:25,353
(screaming)

3367
03:27:25,353 --> 03:27:29,565
LIAM: What's your armor class, Dren?

3368
03:27:29,565 --> 03:27:31,191
ASHLY: It is 14.

3369
03:27:31,191 --> 03:27:39,665
LIAM: I'm so sorry, but you take five points of
piercing damage as the teeth sink into the bottom

3370
03:27:39,665 --> 03:27:51,779
of your sword arm. Obby, this dog lunges right at
you and you feel it get up under your neck and

3371
03:27:51,779 --> 03:27:56,800
bite right here at your shoulder. And you take
five points of piercing damage--

3372
03:27:56,800 --> 03:27:58,217
SAM: Better than 16?

3373
03:27:58,217 --> 03:27:59,440
LIAM: That's your armor class?

3374
03:27:59,440 --> 03:28:00,393
SAM: Yes.

3375
03:28:00,393 --> 03:28:06,223
LIAM: I take it back. You push its head up and
it's going (biting sounds) and you shove it off.

3376
03:28:06,223 --> 03:28:12,896
It rolled a 15. Thank you for that. I didn't
remember that your armor class was so high. And

3377
03:28:12,896 --> 03:28:20,780
this one rushes at our half-orc commander, but
it's so fucked up and so sad now, it blindly

3378
03:28:20,780 --> 03:28:27,074
misses you. And now it is Devan's turn.

3379
03:28:27,074 --> 03:28:33,532
LAURA: Can I run around the room?

3380
03:28:33,532 --> 03:28:36,635
(laughing)

3381
03:28:36,635 --> 03:28:41,433
LAURA: I'm going to run and try to get to the
other side of the room with the doors.

3382
03:28:41,433 --> 03:28:46,251
LIAM: Which way do you want to go? This way? You
can scoot under her legs or--

3383
03:28:46,251 --> 03:28:48,793
LAURA: Yeah, I'll scoot under Delweth's
legs.

3384
03:28:48,793 --> 03:28:53,412
LIAM: I'm going to do this one time. I'm going to
remind you that both of these dogs get an

3385
03:28:53,412 --> 03:28:57,419
opportunity attack. This is the last time I'm
going to remind any of you motherfuckers.

3386
03:28:57,419 --> 03:29:05,293
LAURA: I know that they will, but I don't really
have another option here. If I move, can I make it

3387
03:29:05,293 --> 03:29:06,955
across to the doors?

3388
03:29:06,955 --> 03:29:09,508
LIAM: What's your movement?

3389
03:29:09,508 --> 03:29:10,486
LAURA: 25.

3390
03:29:10,486 --> 03:29:11,773
LIAM: You want to go straight across?

3391
03:29:11,773 --> 03:29:12,834
LAURA: I don't know.

3392
03:29:12,834 --> 03:29:13,712
(laughter)

3393
03:29:13,712 --> 03:29:18,122
LIAM: No, you won't make it all the way across.
I'd say you'd make it to about there or there.

3394
03:29:18,122 --> 03:29:27,569
LAURA: Then I'm going to-- ugh! Burning Hands
everything in a 15-foot cone of me.

3395
03:29:27,569 --> 03:29:36,958
LIAM: I'll say you're here, so you could get these
two and I'll say you won't get Tarvis.

3396
03:29:36,958 --> 03:29:38,118
LAURA: Okay.

3397
03:29:38,118 --> 03:29:40,435
SAM: Lucky.

3398
03:29:40,435 --> 03:29:43,652
LAURA: So they must make a dexterity saving
throw.

3399
03:29:43,652 --> 03:29:45,295
TRAVIS: (singing) Living on a prayer!

3400
03:29:45,295 --> 03:29:47,080
LIAM: What's your spell DC?

3401
03:29:47,080 --> 03:29:50,424
LAURA: I really don't have it written anywhere on
these sheets.

3402
03:29:50,424 --> 03:29:53,206
LIAM: I have it. It's 14.

3403
03:29:53,206 --> 03:29:56,109
MARY: All the way on the right.

3404
03:29:56,109 --> 03:30:05,496
LAURA: I have the page! It's a 14! I really have
only been looking at these three.

3405
03:30:05,496 --> 03:30:12,764
LIAM: Okay, little guy makes his save, big guy
does not, so what's your damage?

3406
03:30:12,764 --> 03:30:16,897
LAURA: Okie dokie, here we go.

3407
03:30:16,897 --> 03:30:20,960
LIAM: She puts her thumbs together and fans her
fingers out, pointing at these dogs.

3408
03:30:20,960 --> 03:30:23,806
LAURA: Ooh, 13!

3409
03:30:23,806 --> 03:30:30,168
LIAM: And you have just Sigourney Weavered them,
fire spraying from your hands.

3410
03:30:30,168 --> 03:30:32,185
LAURA: Get away from me, you bitches!

3411
03:30:32,185 --> 03:30:40,870
LIAM: Sets this dog completely on fire, it screams
<i>so</i> pitifully and falls dead, charred.

3412
03:30:40,870 --> 03:30:42,945
LAURA: (screaming) Tarvis! Tarvis!

3413
03:30:42,945 --> 03:30:47,267
LIAM: What was the total damage? Was it 14?

3414
03:30:47,267 --> 03:30:49,801
LAURA: 13.

3415
03:30:49,801 --> 03:30:57,486
LIAM: 13. Okay. All right. And this one is singed
and blackened and one eye is burned away and it

3416
03:30:57,486 --> 03:30:58,512
looks bad.

3417
03:30:58,512 --> 03:30:59,893
MARY: You killed White Fang?

3418
03:30:59,893 --> 03:31:02,643
LIAM: And now it is Tarvis' turn.

3419
03:31:02,643 --> 03:31:04,814
LAURA: Oh, but can I try to-- no.

3420
03:31:04,814 --> 03:31:06,652
LIAM: You can do it if you want to try to do it.

3421
03:31:06,652 --> 03:31:13,067
LAURA: Will I get hit if I move now? There's a
little one next to me? I can't see what's next to me.

3422
03:31:13,067 --> 03:31:14,652
LIAM: There is one dog next to you.

3423
03:31:14,652 --> 03:31:18,331
LAURA: I'm going to run away from it. I'm going to
run under Gelweth's legs.

3424
03:31:18,331 --> 03:31:19,402
LIAM: This way or this way?

3425
03:31:19,402 --> 03:31:23,637
LAURA: Yeah. Oh, under Gelweth's legs. Delweth's
legs. I don't know why I keep calling her Gelweth,

3426
03:31:23,637 --> 03:31:27,492
I'm sorry. It's a good name, Gelweth is a great
name too.

3427
03:31:27,492 --> 03:31:30,003
MARY: Gelweth's great. I love it.

3428
03:31:30,003 --> 03:31:35,123
LIAM: So Delvy runs, you feel teeth sink into the
back of your neck and pull hair and flesh away

3429
03:31:35,123 --> 03:31:38,841
from the back of your neck for five hit points of
piercing damage. You still alive?

3430
03:31:38,841 --> 03:31:39,786
LAURA: Yeah!

3431
03:31:39,786 --> 03:31:46,147
LIAM: You run one, two. I'm going to say you're
there. Now it is Tarvis' turn.

3432
03:31:46,147 --> 03:31:51,639
TRAVIS: Can I turn to the little doggie that is
engaged with Obby?

3433
03:31:51,639 --> 03:31:52,549
LIAM: Yes.

3434
03:31:52,549 --> 03:31:53,814
SAM: Obby the Rat.

3435
03:31:53,814 --> 03:31:56,577
TRAVIS: And go a little scimitar on his punk ass.

3436
03:31:56,577 --> 03:31:57,992
LIAM: (blade slicing)

3437
03:31:57,992 --> 03:32:02,155
SAM: I do not like dogs or number ones.

3438
03:32:02,155 --> 03:32:03,651
LIAM: Again?

3439
03:32:03,651 --> 03:32:09,285
LAURA: I didn't get to take a potion as my bonus
action.

3440
03:32:09,285 --> 03:32:12,577
LIAM: All right, sure. Which one?

3441
03:32:12,577 --> 03:32:14,492
LAURA: Just the greater.

3442
03:32:14,492 --> 03:32:16,985
LIAM: So you have got one greater left and one
superior left?

3443
03:32:16,985 --> 03:32:18,061
LAURA: Yeah.

3444
03:32:18,061 --> 03:32:26,515
LIAM: Okay, Tarvis. In a rush of friendship and
loyalty to your good friend, you do that move that

3445
03:32:26,515 --> 03:32:31,013
you always finish fights with. You bring it up and
you bring it down in a circle and go (grunt) and

3446
03:32:31,013 --> 03:32:35,258
there's so much blood on your hand that you go
(grunt) and the blade flies out of your hand

3447
03:32:35,258 --> 03:32:38,946
across the room and clatters down.

3448
03:32:38,946 --> 03:32:41,121
TRAVIS: Clang-a-lang-lang-lang-lang.

3449
03:32:41,121 --> 03:32:42,418
ASHLY: Oh no!

3450
03:32:42,418 --> 03:32:45,001
TRAVIS: Don't worry, it's all part of the plan.

3451
03:32:45,001 --> 03:32:46,770
LIAM: Would you like to move at all?

3452
03:32:46,770 --> 03:32:50,680
TRAVIS: I would like to <i>disengage</i> and move to
where Dren is.

3453
03:32:50,680 --> 03:32:52,956
LIAM: To Dren? On the other side of Dren?

3454
03:32:52,956 --> 03:32:54,685
TRAVIS: Yeah, behind Dren.

3455
03:32:54,685 --> 03:32:56,473
LIAM: Ooh, you're dead. Here?

3456
03:32:56,473 --> 03:32:57,374
TRAVIS: Yep.

3457
03:32:57,374 --> 03:33:01,638
LIAM: Okay, and now we're onto Delweth. All these
fucking 'D' names.

3458
03:33:01,638 --> 03:33:06,770
MARY: 'D' names, so many 'D' names. How many dogs
are left?

3459
03:33:06,770 --> 03:33:07,983
LIAM: Three.

3460
03:33:07,983 --> 03:33:10,224
MARY: I want to cast Sleep on them.

3461
03:33:10,224 --> 03:33:12,885
LIAM: Go for it.

3462
03:33:12,885 --> 03:33:16,247
LAURA: Ooh, nice. You can cast it on all of them?

3463
03:33:16,247 --> 03:33:25,836
MARY: Yeah, I think. The spell sends creatures
into a magical slumber, roll 5d8, right?

3464
03:33:25,836 --> 03:33:29,690
TRAVIS: 5d8?

3465
03:33:29,690 --> 03:33:32,581
MARY: Yeah, creatures within 20 feet of a point
you choose--

3466
03:33:32,581 --> 03:33:34,774
LIAM: It's everybody within a 20-foot area.

3467
03:33:34,774 --> 03:33:36,717
MARY: <i>Everybody</i>, or--

3468
03:33:36,717 --> 03:33:38,187
LIAM: Everybody.

3469
03:33:38,187 --> 03:33:41,137
MARY: I can't be specific as to who, what, and the
where now?

3470
03:33:41,137 --> 03:33:42,877
TRAVIS: Big ass slumber party.

3471
03:33:42,877 --> 03:33:45,068
SAM: What are you casting?

3472
03:33:45,068 --> 03:33:46,762
MARY: Sleep, I was going to cast Sleep.

3473
03:33:46,762 --> 03:33:51,739
LIAM: Now, you can slap whoever you want awake
afterwards. But it's a 20-foot area.

3474
03:33:51,739 --> 03:33:54,439
SAM: You can also aim it straight up in the air.

3475
03:33:54,439 --> 03:34:01,252
MARY: I can. All right, I'm going to aim it
straight up at that thing. I don't know what that

3476
03:34:01,252 --> 03:34:07,565
is. I can't do a perception check on what the fuck
that is? All right, I'm going to cast Sleep on

3477
03:34:07,565 --> 03:34:08,588
that thing.

3478
03:34:08,588 --> 03:34:11,355
LIAM: Okay, roll the 5d8.

3479
03:34:11,355 --> 03:34:21,184
MARY: 22.

3480
03:34:21,184 --> 03:34:22,700
LIAM: 22?

3481
03:34:22,700 --> 03:34:24,235
MARY: The thing, straight up.

3482
03:34:24,235 --> 03:34:32,704
LIAM: Okay, so you cast and you see the barest
shimmer of starlight between you and it, and it

3483
03:34:32,704 --> 03:34:35,319
surrounds it. Nothing happens.

3484
03:34:35,319 --> 03:34:37,503
MARY: Is that a fucking beholder?

3485
03:34:37,503 --> 03:34:48,829
LAURA: No, it's not a beholder. Is it a beholder?
It looks like a beholder. A little beeby

3486
03:34:48,829 --> 03:34:50,141
beholder.

3487
03:34:50,141 --> 03:34:55,475
MARY: You said there was another set of doors?

3488
03:34:55,475 --> 03:34:59,954
LIAM: Yeah, sort of. Metallic doors. You want to
go over there?

3489
03:34:59,954 --> 03:35:01,028
MARY: Yep!

3490
03:35:01,028 --> 03:35:02,567
LIAM: What's your movement?

3491
03:35:02,567 --> 03:35:03,563
MARY: 35.

3492
03:35:03,563 --> 03:35:06,660
SAM: The door is for more monsters to come out.

3493
03:35:06,660 --> 03:35:10,180
LIAM: All right, you're there. Obby, what do you
want to do?

3494
03:35:10,180 --> 03:35:17,997
SAM: Wait, is the White Fang gone? Obby the Rat
would like to kill the dog in front of me.

3495
03:35:17,997 --> 03:35:20,643
LIAM: Okay, fuck yeah. This one?

3496
03:35:20,643 --> 03:35:23,233
SAM: The one on the sigil.

3497
03:35:23,233 --> 03:35:25,320
LIAM: Go for it.

3498
03:35:25,320 --> 03:35:26,681
SAM: Natural 20.

3499
03:35:26,681 --> 03:35:28,900
(cheering)

3500
03:35:28,900 --> 03:35:40,570
SAM: That's a lot of them. With the handaxe, what
is that, 1d6 plus two. Seven. And then--

3501
03:35:40,570 --> 03:35:42,150
TRAVIS: Roll another one, right?

3502
03:35:42,150 --> 03:35:43,550
SAM: Wait, is there sneak attack?

3503
03:35:43,550 --> 03:35:44,996
LAURA: No, there's nothing around it.

3504
03:35:44,996 --> 03:35:47,674
LIAM: Yep, nope.

3505
03:35:47,674 --> 03:35:49,525
SAM: So just seven, wait--

3506
03:35:49,525 --> 03:35:50,838
TRAVIS: Roll another six.

3507
03:35:50,838 --> 03:35:55,771
SAM: Ooh, another six. So wait, so five and five
plus two?

3508
03:35:55,771 --> 03:35:57,569
TRAVIS: Each time.

3509
03:35:57,569 --> 03:36:00,392
SAM: Each time plus two? 14.

3510
03:36:00,392 --> 03:36:04,295
LIAM: 14? Okay, and what weapon are you using for
that?

3511
03:36:04,295 --> 03:36:05,656
SAM: Handaxe.

3512
03:36:05,656 --> 03:36:13,462
LIAM: Handaxe, okay. You sink this axe right down
into its neck. And you feel cutting into the bone

3513
03:36:13,462 --> 03:36:20,583
of the thing, and it screams. The dog screams, but
it writhes and lashes in anger, in a fit. It is

3514
03:36:20,583 --> 03:36:22,331
still moving.

3515
03:36:22,331 --> 03:36:28,722
SAM: I will try one more time to open door on
floor.

3516
03:36:28,722 --> 03:36:34,409
LIAM: That's more than a bonus action, I think.

3517
03:36:34,409 --> 03:36:40,982
SAM: Okay, I will not do that. Instead, I will
say, Tarvis, do you need potion?

3518
03:36:40,982 --> 03:36:42,693
TRAVIS: Nope.

3519
03:36:42,693 --> 03:36:50,664
SAM: And I'll disengage and back away from the dog
then.

3520
03:36:50,664 --> 03:36:51,955
LIAM: Okay, you're going this way?

3521
03:36:51,955 --> 03:36:53,497
SAM: Yeah, as far as I can.

3522
03:36:53,497 --> 03:36:55,007
LIAM: (gurgling)

3523
03:36:55,007 --> 03:36:56,599
LAURA: Oh no, it's coming down!

3524
03:36:56,599 --> 03:36:58,634
ASHLY: Wait, I didn't get to go. Should I have
gone?

3525
03:36:58,634 --> 03:37:01,984
LIAM: You didn't go?

3526
03:37:01,984 --> 03:37:03,217
ASHLY: I did not go.

3527
03:37:03,217 --> 03:37:04,667
LIAM: Go for it.

3528
03:37:04,667 --> 03:37:06,915
ASHLY: Do I have sneak attack on any of these
dudes?

3529
03:37:06,915 --> 03:37:09,236
LIAM: Nope.

3530
03:37:09,236 --> 03:37:10,285
ASHLY: I don't?

3531
03:37:10,285 --> 03:37:11,132
LIAM: Nope.

3532
03:37:11,132 --> 03:37:16,969
ASHLY: Son of a-- Let's see. I'll attack--

3533
03:37:16,969 --> 03:37:19,567
LIAM: You know what it is? It's the 'D' names.
I've like scrawled everything so it's like

3534
03:37:19,567 --> 03:37:20,759
(gibberish).

3535
03:37:20,759 --> 03:37:29,324
ASHLY: I'm going to attack the dude that Obby the
Rat just attacked?

3536
03:37:29,324 --> 03:37:30,509
LIAM: This one? Sure.

3537
03:37:30,509 --> 03:37:31,368
ASHLY: Yes.

3538
03:37:31,368 --> 03:37:32,688
LIAM: Okay, what are you using?

3539
03:37:32,688 --> 03:37:35,605
ASHLY: My crossbow?

3540
03:37:35,605 --> 03:37:37,496
LIAM: You can use a crossbow. Sure.

3541
03:37:37,496 --> 03:37:39,641
ASHLY: It's not as strong as my shortsword though.
There's a dog right next to me, huh.

3542
03:37:39,641 --> 03:37:40,763
LIAM: Right behind you, yeah.

3543
03:37:40,763 --> 03:37:48,248
ASHLY: Can I move towards that doggy?

3544
03:37:48,248 --> 03:37:49,381
LIAM: This one?

3545
03:37:49,381 --> 03:37:53,544
LAURA: He'll get an attack of opportunity on you,
the one next to you, if you move away from it.

3546
03:37:53,544 --> 03:37:54,671
ASHLY: That's right.

3547
03:37:54,671 --> 03:37:57,415
SAM: Unless you disengage.

3548
03:37:57,415 --> 03:37:59,486
LAURA: That's your bonus action.

3549
03:37:59,486 --> 03:38:04,953
ASHLY: After I attack? I can do it first? Can I
disengage first?

3550
03:38:04,953 --> 03:38:06,287
LIAM: Yeah.

3551
03:38:06,287 --> 03:38:12,535
ASHLY: And move next to-- is it Alby over there? On
the side?

3552
03:38:12,535 --> 03:38:13,635
LAURA: Yeah.

3553
03:38:13,635 --> 03:38:15,124
LIAM: To Alby? Obby is over here.

3554
03:38:15,124 --> 03:38:16,191
SAM: Pronounced Obby.

3555
03:38:16,191 --> 03:38:17,288
ASHLY: Sorry!

3556
03:38:17,288 --> 03:38:23,546
LIAM: You can get that far. You bolt over there,
run towards the wall, you whip around and turn

3557
03:38:23,546 --> 03:38:25,507
with your crossbow?

3558
03:38:25,507 --> 03:38:26,344
ASHLY: Yes!

3559
03:38:26,344 --> 03:38:28,114
LIAM: You press your back into the wall and-- this
one?

3560
03:38:28,114 --> 03:38:29,150
ASHLY: Yeah, guy in the middle.

3561
03:38:29,150 --> 03:38:30,155
LIAM: Okay, roll the attack.

3562
03:38:30,155 --> 03:38:31,499
SAM: Short for Obenthal.

3563
03:38:31,499 --> 03:38:32,608
MARY: Or just Oben.

3564
03:38:32,608 --> 03:38:34,323
ASHLY: 23.

3565
03:38:34,323 --> 03:38:36,846
LIAM: That hits, roll to hit. Roll for damage.

3566
03:38:36,846 --> 03:38:41,122
ASHLY: But no sneak attack. Just normie style.
Seven!

3567
03:38:41,122 --> 03:38:42,477
LIAM: Seven total?

3568
03:38:42,477 --> 03:38:43,290
ASHLY: Yes.

3569
03:38:43,290 --> 03:38:48,763
LIAM: Okay, the bolt sinks right into the eye of
the thing (death rattling).

3570
03:38:48,763 --> 03:38:50,753
(cheering)

3571
03:38:50,753 --> 03:38:54,056
SAM: Thank you, Dren.

3572
03:38:54,056 --> 03:38:55,627
ASHLY: You're welcome, Alby.

3573
03:38:55,627 --> 03:39:09,808
LIAM: (gargling) You're getting a better look at
it. It is like some sort of green, scaly ball with

3574
03:39:09,808 --> 03:39:13,035
a big fat eyeball out of it with four little
stalks--

3575
03:39:13,035 --> 03:39:15,358
LAURA: It is a baby beholder!

3576
03:39:15,358 --> 03:39:20,863
LIAM: And one of the stalks hangs like dead, limp,
with a bandage around the eye. But three of them

3577
03:39:20,863 --> 03:39:22,168
are going like (whooshing).

3578
03:39:22,168 --> 03:39:24,015
LAURA: Aw, little buddy got hurt.

3579
03:39:24,015 --> 03:39:25,922
ASHLY: (singing) Beholder babies!

3580
03:39:25,922 --> 03:39:28,744
LIAM: In fact, he turns one of his eyes towards
you, Devan--

3581
03:39:28,744 --> 03:39:30,480
TRAVIS: Towards Devan!

3582
03:39:30,480 --> 03:39:31,570
LAURA: Me?

3583
03:39:31,570 --> 03:39:34,547
LIAM: Devan, make a--

3584
03:39:34,547 --> 03:39:37,434
SAM: Death saving throw.

3585
03:39:37,434 --> 03:39:39,405
LIAM: Make a constitution save.

3586
03:39:39,405 --> 03:39:43,851
LAURA: 23!

3587
03:39:43,851 --> 03:39:50,080
LIAM: Okay, you feel the ray goes (buzzing) right
down onto you, you're looking right at it, and

3588
03:39:50,080 --> 03:39:56,781
your whole body stiffens. (panting) And you shake
it away. You're okay.

3589
03:39:56,781 --> 03:39:58,016
LAURA: I'm okay.

3590
03:39:58,016 --> 03:40:08,540
LIAM: Now we're onto "Dogs, dogs, dogs, dogs."
This one sees you, Dren, lunges in. Totally bites

3591
03:40:08,540 --> 03:40:11,998
your face! Eight points.

3592
03:40:11,998 --> 03:40:15,929
ASHLY: Ah! All right.

3593
03:40:15,929 --> 03:40:20,521
LIAM: This one goes for the-- you know what? (two
puff noises)

3594
03:40:20,521 --> 03:40:22,146
LAURA: Come on!

3595
03:40:22,146 --> 03:40:26,899
LIAM: Totally bites your face for five points of
piercing damage. And when I say face, I meant it,

3596
03:40:26,899 --> 03:40:28,730
it took a piece of your cheek and ear away.

3597
03:40:28,730 --> 03:40:30,232
LAURA: Why are you being a dick?

3598
03:40:30,232 --> 03:40:33,073
SAM: Mostly skull at this point.

3599
03:40:33,073 --> 03:40:38,185
LIAM: Now it is Devan's turn.

3600
03:40:38,185 --> 03:40:40,506
MARY: Come on, Dev.

3601
03:40:40,506 --> 03:40:42,289
LIAM: Hot blood trailing down your--

3602
03:40:42,289 --> 03:40:43,931
SAM: Pop that potion.

3603
03:40:43,931 --> 03:40:51,870
LAURA: I'm going to Burning Hands him because that
seemed to work so well before.

3604
03:40:51,870 --> 03:41:01,009
LIAM: Okay. All right, he takes the full blast.
The dog put all its dog concentration on bamfing

3605
03:41:01,009 --> 03:41:05,240
out of one place right here and as soon as it got
here, it bit you and it went, "Surprise motherfucker!"

3606
03:41:05,240 --> 03:41:06,988
(whooshing)

3607
03:41:06,988 --> 03:41:07,989
LAURA: Ten!

3608
03:41:07,989 --> 03:41:11,528
LIAM: All right. There is a dead, charred dog.

3609
03:41:11,528 --> 03:41:13,457
(cheering)

3610
03:41:13,457 --> 03:41:20,463
LAURA: (panting) And I'm going to run forward
toward the doors! And while I'm running, I'm going

3611
03:41:20,463 --> 03:41:24,506
to bust out my other-- oh wait, if I get to the
door can I bonus action it?

3612
03:41:24,506 --> 03:41:26,696
LIAM: No.

3613
03:41:26,696 --> 03:41:28,790
LAURA: I'm going to take another potion!

3614
03:41:28,790 --> 03:41:32,151
LIAM: Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle, gurgle. All right,
Tarvis, you are up.

3615
03:41:32,151 --> 03:41:40,219
TRAVIS: With my 30 speed, can I go to the last
D-O-G?

3616
03:41:40,219 --> 03:41:41,276
LIAM: Yep.

3617
03:41:41,276 --> 03:41:44,160
TRAVIS: And I will take my whip!

3618
03:41:44,160 --> 03:41:47,501
MARY: What! Take your whip?

3619
03:41:47,501 --> 03:41:49,110
TRAVIS: (whipping sound)

3620
03:41:49,110 --> 03:41:52,531
(laughter)

3621
03:41:52,531 --> 03:41:54,149
TRAVIS: (shouting) What the fuck!

3622
03:41:54,149 --> 03:41:57,388
(shouting)

3623
03:41:57,388 --> 03:42:00,227
LIAM: You're so angry--

3624
03:42:00,227 --> 03:42:04,975
TRAVIS: Each one of those has been with a
different dice.

3625
03:42:04,975 --> 03:42:09,238
LIAM: You're furious at how this night is going,
this night is <i>fucked</i>, and it's all because of

3626
03:42:09,238 --> 03:42:13,253
this one. You come over, full of anger, and you're
going to take it out on this dog. And you go

3627
03:42:13,253 --> 03:42:23,717
(whooshing). Dog, you feel a cut up your own eye.
Two points of slashing damage.

3628
03:42:23,717 --> 03:42:28,006
ASHLY: Why is he our leader?

3629
03:42:28,006 --> 03:42:29,991
(laughter)

3630
03:42:29,991 --> 03:42:32,453
LIAM: Dren, you're up!

3631
03:42:32,453 --> 03:42:35,947
ASHLY: Okay! I'm going to, first things first,
take a potion.

3632
03:42:35,947 --> 03:42:37,541
MARY: Dren just went!

3633
03:42:37,541 --> 03:42:40,559
LIAM: I missed her.

3634
03:42:40,559 --> 03:42:42,856
SAM: We all missed her, really.

3635
03:42:42,856 --> 03:42:44,548
MARY: We missed her so much.

3636
03:42:44,548 --> 03:42:53,098
ASHLY: Thanks, guys. 11?

3637
03:42:53,098 --> 03:42:54,418
LAURA: Ooh, nice. Plus four.

3638
03:42:54,418 --> 03:42:56,208
ASHLY: Plus four's 15!

3639
03:42:56,208 --> 03:42:57,936
LIAM: For your hit points? Okay.

3640
03:42:57,936 --> 03:43:06,315
ASHLY: Yeah. All right. Back of the net! Okay, so
now, I'm going to fuck up that dog right next to me.

3641
03:43:06,315 --> 03:43:07,450
LIAM: Yeah.

3642
03:43:07,450 --> 03:43:10,519
ASHLY: So that is a 20.

3643
03:43:10,519 --> 03:43:12,293
LIAM: Yeah, that hits.

3644
03:43:12,293 --> 03:43:14,749
ASHLY: It's not a sneak attack probably, right?

3645
03:43:14,749 --> 03:43:15,847
LIAM: It is a sneak attack.

3646
03:43:15,847 --> 03:43:16,676
ASHLY: Oh, it is?

3647
03:43:16,676 --> 03:43:18,111
LIAM: Because Tarvis is right here.

3648
03:43:18,111 --> 03:43:20,789
ASHLY: Aw shit, son. All right, that's a nine.

3649
03:43:20,789 --> 03:43:22,355
LIAM: Here comes the general!

3650
03:43:22,355 --> 03:43:27,166
ASHLY: So that's nine. 19!

3651
03:43:27,166 --> 03:43:29,719
LIAM: Which weapon did you use?

3652
03:43:29,719 --> 03:43:30,914
ASHLY: Shortsword.

3653
03:43:30,914 --> 03:43:39,124
LIAM: Shortsword? Okay, you feel bad for your
higher-up here, and as conflicted as you are in

3654
03:43:39,124 --> 03:43:44,498
the situation, as as many things are going on, you
still trained a long time; you are Clasp. You

3655
03:43:44,498 --> 03:43:49,215
take your blade, and you bring it up, and you
swing it, and you're so short you push up, and

3656
03:43:49,215 --> 03:43:55,334
it's the smallest dog in the group, and you spear
it like a shish kabob. And blood and guts spills

3657
03:43:55,334 --> 03:43:58,901
down over your hands, and it slumps down to the
ground.

3658
03:43:58,901 --> 03:44:01,098
SAM: Has Dren killed everyone tonight?

3659
03:44:01,098 --> 03:44:04,157
TRAVIS: Nice job, Dren.

3660
03:44:04,157 --> 03:44:05,989
LAURA: I killed two things. Halflings.

3661
03:44:05,989 --> 03:44:08,743
ASHLY: Halflings. Woop woop.

3662
03:44:08,743 --> 03:44:11,753
LIAM: (gurgling)

3663
03:44:11,753 --> 03:44:14,113
ASHLY: Oh right, that guy.

3664
03:44:14,113 --> 03:44:20,531
MARY: I turn around and I look at the doors. And I
use Mage Hand to try and open them.

3665
03:44:20,531 --> 03:44:27,131
LIAM: The hand pries and walks around like a
little spider, pulls and pulls, and it's the

3666
03:44:27,131 --> 03:44:30,218
saddest little thing, and it turns around and
goes.

3667
03:44:30,218 --> 03:44:34,646
MARY: I'm useless. Is that my action?

3668
03:44:34,646 --> 03:44:36,354
LIAM: Yep.

3669
03:44:36,354 --> 03:44:37,495
MARY: Really?

3670
03:44:37,495 --> 03:44:43,413
LIAM: It still exists. Your hand is still there.

3671
03:44:43,413 --> 03:44:45,967
LAURA: Ooh, you could bitch-slap the baby
beholder.

3672
03:44:45,967 --> 03:44:49,284
MARY: All right, I'm going to bitch-slap the
little beholder.

3673
03:44:49,284 --> 03:44:52,752
LIAM: Your hand starts floating in that direction,
I'll say.

3674
03:44:52,752 --> 03:44:59,168
MARY: I'll take Devan and put her right in front
of me.

3675
03:44:59,168 --> 03:45:02,354
LIAM: Nah.

3676
03:45:02,354 --> 03:45:03,472
MARY: She's right next to me.

3677
03:45:03,472 --> 03:45:06,522
LIAM: Yeah, but you did some stuff already. You
already cast a spell.

3678
03:45:06,522 --> 03:45:08,536
MARY: Then I'm going to hide behind Devan. That's
my bonus action.

3679
03:45:08,536 --> 03:45:10,729
LAURA: You can't, I'm a halfling. You can't hide
behind me.

3680
03:45:10,729 --> 03:45:15,839
LIAM: You know what you do? You kick the ground in
anger and go, "Aww." And now it is--

3681
03:45:15,839 --> 03:45:18,073
MARY: I can't go behind Devan?

3682
03:45:18,073 --> 03:45:24,622
LIAM: Nope, she's pressed against the wall. She's
right up against the wall. You'll get yours. Obby,

3683
03:45:24,622 --> 03:45:25,980
you're up.

3684
03:45:25,980 --> 03:45:34,169
SAM: Obby the Rat moves to center of room, says
thank you to Dren for killing all dogs.

3685
03:45:34,169 --> 03:45:35,619
ASHLY: Welcome.

3686
03:45:35,619 --> 03:45:48,939
SAM: I give haiku to Dren. I say: I'm Obby the
Rat, you know why they call me that? 'Cause I hate

3687
03:45:48,939 --> 03:45:51,301
haiku.

3688
03:45:51,301 --> 03:45:54,475
ASHLY: That was a really good haiku.

3689
03:45:54,475 --> 03:45:58,029
LIAM: You didn't even have to rhyme, but you still
did.

3690
03:45:58,029 --> 03:46:03,457
SAM: Shit. Okay, I look down.

3691
03:46:03,457 --> 03:46:06,290
LIAM: You called that out as you ran to the center
of the room.

3692
03:46:06,290 --> 03:46:11,321
SAM: I look down real quick. Do I see any
imperfections, anything in the floor, anything

3693
03:46:11,405 --> 03:46:12,246
that I can--?

3694
03:46:12,246 --> 03:46:16,228
LIAM: At this moment you have the time to go, "Oh,
fuck," and that's what you accomplish.

3695
03:46:16,228 --> 03:46:19,916
SAM: In that case, I look straight up and I throw
a dagger.

3696
03:46:19,916 --> 03:46:21,729
LIAM: Go for it. Roll to attack.

3697
03:46:21,729 --> 03:46:24,516
SAM: 17 plus seven.

3698
03:46:24,516 --> 03:46:25,655
MARY: Hell yeah!

3699
03:46:25,655 --> 03:46:27,487
SAM: 24.

3700
03:46:27,487 --> 03:46:35,393
LIAM: The dagger goes (whooshing, impact) and you
hear (gurgling). Roll for damage.

3701
03:46:35,393 --> 03:46:37,397
SAM: Eight.

3702
03:46:37,397 --> 03:46:42,536
LIAM: All right. A little bit of ichor splatters
back down on your face as you look up.

3703
03:46:42,536 --> 03:46:45,754
SAM: Not the worst thing that's been on my face
today.

3704
03:46:45,754 --> 03:47:01,323
LIAM: Okay. It rotates in space and looks down at
you, Obby. And please make a wisdom saving throw.

3705
03:47:01,323 --> 03:47:04,750
SAM: Wisdom, not my strength.

3706
03:47:04,750 --> 03:47:06,689
ASHLY: This is going to be rough for me.

3707
03:47:06,689 --> 03:47:07,964
SAM: Five.

3708
03:47:07,964 --> 03:47:20,857
LIAM: Five? A ray shoots straight down into your
eyes, and you go slack. And think of colors.

3709
03:47:20,857 --> 03:47:25,895
And that is where you're at. And now it is time
for--

3710
03:47:25,895 --> 03:47:31,617
TRAVIS: What is he? Is he stupid? Charmed?

3711
03:47:31,617 --> 03:47:34,330
LIAM: And now it is Devan's turn.

3712
03:47:34,330 --> 03:47:41,319
LAURA: Okay. Can I turn around? Do I see the sigil
on the doors?

3713
03:47:41,319 --> 03:47:42,454
LIAM: You do.

3714
03:47:42,454 --> 03:47:45,745
LAURA: I want to open my hand and stick it on
there.

3715
03:47:45,745 --> 03:47:49,947
LIAM: You can. So far it's taken about 20 to 30
seconds to do that, and a round is six seconds.

3716
03:47:49,947 --> 03:48:02,250
LAURA: Shit. Okay. I'm going to try casting--
damn. Chromatic Orb, man, that's my longest range

3717
03:48:02,250 --> 03:48:03,143
attack.

3718
03:48:03,143 --> 03:48:04,212
LIAM: That's your last--?

3719
03:48:04,212 --> 03:48:05,253
LAURA: No, I've got two more--

3720
03:48:05,253 --> 03:48:05,964
LIAM: Two more?

3721
03:48:05,964 --> 03:48:06,681
LAURA: Yeah.

3722
03:48:06,681 --> 03:48:07,544
LIAM: Okay.

3723
03:48:07,544 --> 03:48:08,463
LAURA: So I've got one more.

3724
03:48:08,463 --> 03:48:09,526
LIAM: All right, make a ranged attack.

3725
03:48:09,526 --> 03:48:13,045
LAURA: Oh wait, did I forget to mark off a Burning
Hands?

3726
03:48:13,045 --> 03:48:14,818
MARY: You did two.

3727
03:48:14,818 --> 03:48:16,064
LIAM: You did two Burning Hands.

3728
03:48:16,064 --> 03:48:19,875
LAURA: I did two Burning Hands? Okay. And I did
another Chromatic Orb. So yes, this is my last

3729
03:48:19,875 --> 03:48:24,309
first level. Okay, yeah.

3730
03:48:24,309 --> 03:48:26,695
LIAM: So ranged attack with a plus six on your
roll.

3731
03:48:26,695 --> 03:48:32,398
LAURA: Okay. 24.

3732
03:48:32,398 --> 03:48:33,715
LIAM: What kind was it?

3733
03:48:33,715 --> 03:48:38,178
LAURA: I really want to do a thunder attack on
somebody.

3734
03:48:38,178 --> 03:48:39,678
LIAM: Sure.

3735
03:48:39,678 --> 03:48:40,818
LAURA: Thunder attack.

3736
03:48:40,818 --> 03:48:42,735
LIAM: Go for it, man, that sounds pretty good.

3737
03:48:42,735 --> 03:48:45,199
LAURA: Yeah. So that's 3d8, man.

3738
03:48:45,199 --> 03:48:46,377
LIAM: You hit, yeah.

3739
03:48:46,377 --> 03:48:55,848
LAURA: 24, man. No, wait, I did my math wrong. 22,
man.

3740
03:48:55,848 --> 03:49:06,846
LIAM: 22? Okay. This crackling ball with little
arcs of light spitting out of it flies up, hits

3741
03:49:06,846 --> 03:49:18,781
the thing. (explosion) The thing spins out of
kilter, down, lower-- shite. Aw shite. I don't

3742
03:49:18,781 --> 03:49:20,799
have the right boxes. I'm going to say he's right
there.

3743
03:49:20,799 --> 03:49:24,813
MARY: Precariously hovering in space.

3744
03:49:24,813 --> 03:49:30,142
LIAM: It spins end over end and starts to right
himself and hover right about there. Nice.

3745
03:49:30,142 --> 03:49:31,995
LAURA: And then I'm going to hide behind Delweth.

3746
03:49:31,995 --> 03:49:36,627
LIAM: Okay, okay. Yes, you can do that. Roll for
stealth.

3747
03:49:36,627 --> 03:49:37,772
LAURA: Because I'm smaller.

3748
03:49:37,772 --> 03:49:38,864
MARY: Oh, yeah. I understand.

3749
03:49:38,864 --> 03:49:42,184
SAM: Is his spell on me concentration?

3750
03:49:42,184 --> 03:49:43,284
LAURA: 17.

3751
03:49:43,284 --> 03:49:50,799
LIAM: Okay. I heard that question, and I'm
ignoring it. Tarvis, it is your turn.

3752
03:49:50,799 --> 03:49:58,273
TRAVIS: I'm so frustrated with how this night is
going. I'm questioning my own leadership. And I

3753
03:49:58,273 --> 03:50:02,748
follow my friend Obby's lead and I throw a dagger
at the mini beholder.

3754
03:50:02,748 --> 03:50:04,526
SAM: Hits you in the face.

3755
03:50:04,526 --> 03:50:05,815
MARY: And you die.

3756
03:50:05,815 --> 03:50:08,231
TRAVIS: I go closer if I have to.

3757
03:50:08,231 --> 03:50:13,050
LIAM: You could've done it, but it would've been
at disadvantage. Now I'll say it is not.

3758
03:50:13,050 --> 03:50:17,194
TRAVIS: I'll even go right up against the wall, so
I can look in the direction of other people.

3759
03:50:17,194 --> 03:50:19,535
LIAM: That's as close as you can get. Chuck it,
baby.

3760
03:50:19,535 --> 03:50:27,152
TRAVIS: It's a ten! I am impotent!

3761
03:50:27,152 --> 03:50:35,002
LIAM: The blood from the whip cut is down in your
eye and you can't see. You see two of these

3762
03:50:35,002 --> 03:50:42,259
things? And you got the illusionary one. You got
that one. But not the real one. Your dagger hits

3763
03:50:42,259 --> 03:50:49,575
the ground and clatters and actually spins right
down to the ground by you. And now it is Dren's turn.

3764
03:50:49,575 --> 03:50:53,558
ASHLY: Okay. Could I get to the other side of the
room?

3765
03:50:53,558 --> 03:50:59,686
LIAM: You can get one, two, three. Where do you
want to go? Here?

3766
03:50:59,686 --> 03:51:00,987
ASHLY: Yeah.

3767
03:51:00,987 --> 03:51:08,600
LIAM: You could get (counting). That's as close as
you can get. You're teensy-weensy.

3768
03:51:08,600 --> 03:51:15,140
ASHLY: I'm teensy-weensy. And then I'm going to
shoot at little beholder-man with my crossbow.

3769
03:51:15,140 --> 03:51:18,758
SAM: Nathan Beholderman.

3770
03:51:18,758 --> 03:51:22,067
MARY: His father, Zyrah.

3771
03:51:22,067 --> 03:51:23,501
ASHLY: That's a 24.

3772
03:51:23,501 --> 03:51:24,660
LIAM: You hit, man.

3773
03:51:24,660 --> 03:51:31,311
ASHLY: Okay. Is it sneak attack? Eight.

3774
03:51:31,311 --> 03:51:41,886
LIAM: Eight? The crossbow bolt sinks into the side
of its main eye and juice comes out. You hear the

3775
03:51:41,886 --> 03:51:45,702
most-- I'm not even going to try to do it,
because I had a rough warrior day today yelling

3776
03:51:45,702 --> 03:51:54,140
for four hours-- the most high-pitched squeal in
the side of your own mind, and the thing lurches

3777
03:51:54,140 --> 03:52:06,392
and stays up, but is gushing out of its large eye
in the front. And now it is Delweth's turn.

3778
03:52:06,392 --> 03:52:09,923
MARY: How far away is it?

3779
03:52:09,923 --> 03:52:12,925
LIAM: It's about 40 feet, 50.

3780
03:52:12,925 --> 03:52:17,561
MARY: Do we have a range on how far I could throw
something?

3781
03:52:17,561 --> 03:52:23,183
LIAM: You can throw 20 feet well and you can throw
60 feet at disadvantage. So you could throw where

3782
03:52:23,183 --> 03:52:25,479
you are at disadvantage, or you could run
closer.

3783
03:52:25,479 --> 03:52:29,521
MARY: I'm going to charge in and take my rapier
and--

3784
03:52:29,521 --> 03:52:31,430
LAURA: No, but I was hiding!

3785
03:52:31,430 --> 03:52:34,937
MARY: Sorry, love. Take my rapier and fling it--

3786
03:52:34,937 --> 03:52:40,825
LIAM: That's not what that's for, but you can do
it at disadvantage. Or your dagger.

3787
03:52:40,825 --> 03:52:42,589
MARY: Very good. I'll do it with a dagger.

3788
03:52:42,589 --> 03:52:47,609
LIAM: Okay. Roll an attack with your dagger.
You pull a dagger out of your belt, you take it by

3789
03:52:47,609 --> 03:52:49,140
the blade and flick it, and--

3790
03:52:49,140 --> 03:52:52,527
MARY: I got a ten plus what?

3791
03:52:52,527 --> 03:52:54,003
SAM: Plus five on the dagger.

3792
03:52:54,003 --> 03:52:54,946
MARY: 15.

3793
03:52:54,946 --> 03:52:56,435
LIAM: How do you want to do this?

3794
03:52:56,435 --> 03:52:58,466
(cheering)

3795
03:52:58,466 --> 03:53:03,027
MARY: How many eyeballs does he have left?

3796
03:53:03,027 --> 03:53:07,693
LIAM: Well it always had four. One was limp and
hanging and loosey-goosey--

3797
03:53:07,693 --> 03:53:09,009
TRAVIS: I know what that's like.

3798
03:53:09,009 --> 03:53:17,005
LIAM: It had one big eye in the front which Dren
gouged the side of. Most of it's there.

3799
03:53:17,005 --> 03:53:21,752
MARY: Right. I'm going straight in the center of
the giant eyeball in the center.

3800
03:53:21,752 --> 03:53:27,591
LIAM: Okay. The thing has just gotten hit in the eye
and bounced against the wall and starts to float

3801
03:53:27,591 --> 03:53:36,876
back in the other direction. And it slowly starts
to float downward, its ability to hold itself

3802
03:53:36,876 --> 03:53:44,239
up weakening and weakening, and it lands
slowly on top of Tarvis, falling asleep on him,

3803
03:53:44,239 --> 03:53:51,523
almost, dying, lowers you down to the ground on the
back, slowly and you're okay, you didn't get hurt,

3804
03:53:51,523 --> 03:53:57,965
but here you are on the ground with a beholder
junior sitting on your junk.

3805
03:53:57,965 --> 03:54:01,216
TRAVIS: Obby, get this thing off of me!

3806
03:54:01,216 --> 03:54:04,264
SAM: Yellow and purple.

3807
03:54:04,264 --> 03:54:06,640
MARY: I pull out my dagger.

3808
03:54:06,640 --> 03:54:11,551
LAURA: Can I cast Minor Illusion and make the
sound of more dogs barking on the other side of

3809
03:54:11,551 --> 03:54:13,697
the doorway we came in at?

3810
03:54:13,697 --> 03:54:14,684
LIAM: Yes.

3811
03:54:14,684 --> 03:54:18,983
TRAVIS: Is Obby released, now that the beholder's
dead, from the whatever happened to him?

3812
03:54:18,983 --> 03:54:23,522
LIAM: Yes, he is, he starts to shake his head.

3813
03:54:23,522 --> 03:54:25,988
TRAVIS: Get me out from under this thing!

3814
03:54:25,988 --> 03:54:27,772
SAM: Tarvis, what did they do to you?

3815
03:54:27,772 --> 03:54:29,479
TRAVIS: I killed it and it fell on me.

3816
03:54:29,479 --> 03:54:31,919
SAM: You are brave and wise leader.

3817
03:54:31,919 --> 03:54:33,749
TRAVIS: He doesn't need to know, come on.

3818
03:54:33,749 --> 03:54:35,967
SAM: I start cutting him out.

3819
03:54:35,967 --> 03:54:37,335
TRAVIS: Thank you.

3820
03:54:37,335 --> 03:54:43,033
LIAM: While you guys are talking, you hear down
the hall-- (barking)

3821
03:54:43,033 --> 03:54:45,782
MARY: More dogs!

3822
03:54:45,782 --> 03:54:47,906
TRAVIS: Devan, you fought bravely. Get the doors
open, now.

3823
03:54:47,906 --> 03:54:48,995
MARY: Come on.

3824
03:54:48,995 --> 03:54:51,743
LIAM: Oh, the cabinet? Okay.

3825
03:54:51,743 --> 03:54:53,008
LAURA: And I try to open the cabinet, yeah.

3826
03:54:53,008 --> 03:54:57,943
LIAM: Okay, so you already cut your hand--
you break open your hand and place it. And you

3827
03:54:57,943 --> 03:55:01,791
wait, and slowly blood pours into it, gets
absorbed in.

3828
03:55:01,791 --> 03:55:07,683
SAM: 20 more beholders.

3829
03:55:07,683 --> 03:55:20,138
LIAM: The cabinet doors swing open, and you're
looking in at a cabinet. You've never seen this

3830
03:55:20,138 --> 03:55:27,509
before. You've seen the doors, and your
grandmother alluded to it, but you're looking at a

3831
03:55:27,509 --> 03:55:37,867
shelf, here. And obviously the thing that catches
your eye first is an emerald the size of a human

3832
03:55:37,867 --> 03:55:40,456
head sitting on a large pillow.

3833
03:55:40,456 --> 03:55:44,498
TRAVIS: We all rush over to take a look. I pick up
my scimitar that got thrown across--

3834
03:55:44,498 --> 03:55:49,983
LAURA: I cast Minor Illusion and I cast another
big emerald next to it.

3835
03:55:49,983 --> 03:55:55,354
LIAM: Next to it, so there's two of them? Okay.
There's two emeralds, you all see. You all see

3836
03:55:55,354 --> 03:55:59,635
that. There's also a set of--

3837
03:55:59,635 --> 03:56:03,393
SAM: Which one is the real one? Ask a question
that only it would know the answer to.

3838
03:56:03,393 --> 03:56:12,108
LIAM: --panpipes, there's panpipes here, but
they're made out of human bones, but they're not

3839
03:56:12,108 --> 03:56:14,835
the right size for a human. They look
child-sized.

3840
03:56:14,835 --> 03:56:16,876
MARY: Next to the--

3841
03:56:16,876 --> 03:56:23,255
LIAM: Yeah, there's a couple of things sitting
here. There's two large emeralds, a pair of

3842
03:56:23,255 --> 03:56:33,286
panpipes made from children's bones. There's a
dark medallion made of iron with an eye etched

3843
03:56:33,286 --> 03:56:48,423
into it, and there's a green leather-bound book
here, clasped shut. And that's all that's here.

3844
03:56:48,423 --> 03:56:54,444
TRAVIS: Can we come up behind Devan? I thought
there was only one of these jewels.

3845
03:56:54,444 --> 03:56:57,825
LAURA: I did, too. I don't know which one's the
real one.

3846
03:56:57,825 --> 03:56:59,273
TRAVIS: What are these other trinkets?

3847
03:56:59,273 --> 03:57:00,858
MARY: Go put your hands on them.

3848
03:57:00,858 --> 03:57:02,326
LAURA: Don't put your hands on anything!

3849
03:57:02,326 --> 03:57:05,320
TRAVIS: I reach out and grab the green book.

3850
03:57:05,320 --> 03:57:06,822
LIAM: The book? Okay.

3851
03:57:06,822 --> 03:57:08,673
TRAVIS: What happens?

3852
03:57:08,673 --> 03:57:10,311
LIAM: Nothing.

3853
03:57:10,311 --> 03:57:11,500
TRAVIS: All right.

3854
03:57:11,500 --> 03:57:13,090
SAM: Can you read?

3855
03:57:13,090 --> 03:57:16,007
LIAM: Intelligence of 18.

3856
03:57:16,007 --> 03:57:20,932
TRAVIS: I'm pretty sure I can. I open it up. What
is it?

3857
03:57:20,932 --> 03:57:27,945
LIAM: Okay, you see lists of amounts, mostly. It's
pages and pages of lists of amounts, and

3858
03:57:27,945 --> 03:57:35,630
short-form code in Common with single letters,
anagrams. But at the back of the book, there's one

3859
03:57:35,630 --> 03:57:45,469
page with a list of names in it, and you see words
like "Quiver" and next to that "Quinton Puck", and

3860
03:57:45,469 --> 03:57:53,080
you scan down, looking for names, and you see the
word "Shortstack". Next to "Shortstack" is the

3861
03:57:53,080 --> 03:58:02,470
name "Grimthorne". You see the word "Sandwich",
and next to that it says "Wynan Joy." You see the

3862
03:58:02,470 --> 03:58:06,674
word "Whisper", and next to it it says "Riskel
Daxio". Those are the ones that stand out. There's

3863
03:58:06,674 --> 03:58:08,748
lots. There's about 30 names here.

3864
03:58:08,748 --> 03:58:13,708
TRAVIS: Oh, shit. I take a step out. Everybody try
grabbing one item.

3865
03:58:13,708 --> 03:58:17,304
LAURA: I grab the emerald.

3866
03:58:17,304 --> 03:58:18,868
ALL: The real one?

3867
03:58:18,868 --> 03:58:21,706
LAURA: Yeah, the real one.

3868
03:58:21,706 --> 03:58:23,542
MARY: I go and grab the other emerald.

3869
03:58:23,542 --> 03:58:25,430
LIAM: Your hands go--

3870
03:58:25,430 --> 03:58:27,016
MARY: What the fuck?

3871
03:58:27,016 --> 03:58:30,384
SAM: Must be some sort of trap that the grandma
left.

3872
03:58:30,384 --> 03:58:36,309
MARY: It's a fake. Everyone be careful. What do
you have in your hands?

3873
03:58:36,309 --> 03:58:38,969
SAM: I grab the iron thing with the eye.

3874
03:58:38,969 --> 03:58:42,722
LIAM: The medallion? Okay. You have to--

3875
03:58:42,722 --> 03:58:46,718
LAURA: I try to pass it to Dren.

3876
03:58:46,718 --> 03:58:49,452
LIAM: Like secretly, or just hand it to her?

3877
03:58:49,452 --> 03:58:55,583
LAURA: Here, you hold this, I'll try grabbing
something else. And then I try grabbing something

3878
03:58:55,583 --> 03:58:57,014
else in the room.

3879
03:58:57,014 --> 03:58:58,463
TRAVIS: After I stepped out--

3880
03:58:58,463 --> 03:59:01,537
LIAM: You pick up a pair of pipes made from
children's bones.

3881
03:59:01,537 --> 03:59:02,539
LAURA: Okay.

3882
03:59:02,539 --> 03:59:09,543
TRAVIS: As she's reaching for the pipes made from
children's bones, I look at Obby, and I say, I got

3883
03:59:09,543 --> 03:59:13,938
what I came for. I walk up behind Devan, I take a
dagger, and I reach around and slice her throat.

3884
03:59:13,938 --> 03:59:15,792
LAURA: I cast Mirror Image and I--

3885
03:59:15,792 --> 03:59:19,922
MARY: Sneak attack. Didn't see it coming.

3886
03:59:19,922 --> 03:59:22,793
LIAM: Roll for stealth.

3887
03:59:22,793 --> 03:59:27,458
LAURA: One.

3888
03:59:27,458 --> 03:59:30,057
TRAVIS: 11.

3889
03:59:30,057 --> 03:59:33,791
LAURA: That's my passive perception is 11.

3890
03:59:33,791 --> 03:59:36,935
LIAM: Then you're fine. Both of you roll for
initiative.

3891
03:59:36,935 --> 03:59:40,552
TRAVIS: Goddamn you piece of shit!

3892
03:59:40,552 --> 03:59:43,704
(laughter)

3893
03:59:43,704 --> 03:59:45,048
LAURA: 13.

3894
03:59:45,048 --> 03:59:45,981
TRAVIS: Seven.

3895
03:59:45,981 --> 03:59:48,514
LIAM: Seven. Do whatever you want to do, Devan.

3896
03:59:48,514 --> 03:59:49,797
LAURA: I cast Mirror Image.

3897
03:59:49,797 --> 03:59:51,047
LIAM: Okay.

3898
03:59:51,047 --> 03:59:52,830
SAM: What does that do?

3899
03:59:52,830 --> 03:59:55,035
LAURA: That creates three other images of myself.

3900
03:59:55,035 --> 03:59:57,021
LIAM: There are suddenly multiple Devans.

3901
03:59:57,021 --> 03:59:58,353
LAURA: And I take off running.

3902
03:59:58,353 --> 04:00:00,212
LIAM: Which way?

3903
04:00:00,212 --> 04:00:03,315
LAURA: I run straight forward.

3904
04:00:03,315 --> 04:00:06,948
LIAM: You're all over here, right? Okay. This way?

3905
04:00:06,948 --> 04:00:10,942
LAURA: Yeah, but all my mirror images are going to
run different directions, so he won't know which

3906
04:00:10,942 --> 04:00:12,003
one is me.

3907
04:00:12,003 --> 04:00:18,525
LIAM: Okay. Tarvis, what would you like to do?

3908
04:00:18,525 --> 04:00:20,612
TRAVIS: How many of her are there?

3909
04:00:20,612 --> 04:00:26,749
LIAM: There's four and you can't tell which one is
the real one. Two are running towards the door,

3910
04:00:26,749 --> 04:00:29,617
two are running to the sides of the room.

3911
04:00:29,617 --> 04:00:36,774
TRAVIS: I look to Obby and say: Devan doesn't need
to live; this ledger is all that matters.

3912
04:00:36,774 --> 04:00:40,748
SAM: You want the one on the right?

3913
04:00:40,748 --> 04:00:44,900
TRAVIS: Let's go for the two running towards the
doors.

3914
04:00:44,900 --> 04:00:51,004
LIAM: You're going to aim for the two at the
door?

3915
04:00:51,004 --> 04:00:51,918
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3916
04:00:51,918 --> 04:00:53,140
LIAM: You attack, what are you doing?

3917
04:00:53,140 --> 04:00:57,364
TRAVIS: Are two of them heading towards the
opposite door or are they standing right where she was?

3918
04:00:57,364 --> 04:01:03,224
LIAM: One Devan is here, one Devan is here, two
are right next to each other one just ahead of the other.

3919
04:01:03,224 --> 04:01:06,267
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll take the one that's just behind
the one that's ahead of the other.

3920
04:01:06,267 --> 04:01:10,272
SAM: I will throw a dagger at the other one.

3921
04:01:10,272 --> 04:01:13,219
LIAM: Well you're not doing anything, you are.

3922
04:01:13,219 --> 04:01:15,776
SAM: I'm not doing anything, I'm looking at the
medallion.

3923
04:01:15,776 --> 04:01:20,454
LIAM: I wish I had a coin. All right. I know what
I'll do.

3924
04:01:20,454 --> 04:01:22,765
SAM: Wait, it's a d2, don't you have a d2?

3925
04:01:22,765 --> 04:01:25,523
LIAM: I'm good. So roll to attack.

3926
04:01:25,523 --> 04:01:27,944
SAM: Do the percentage die, we never get to use
those!

3927
04:01:27,944 --> 04:01:28,934
LIAM: Roll to attack.

3928
04:01:28,934 --> 04:01:30,149
LAURA: Oh god.

3929
04:01:30,149 --> 04:01:32,362
SAM: Finally.

3930
04:01:32,362 --> 04:01:33,348
TRAVIS: 18.

3931
04:01:33,348 --> 04:01:39,914
LIAM: 18? Okay. Roll for damage.

3932
04:01:39,914 --> 04:01:47,340
TRAVIS: Wait, it's a four for a dagger. Five.

3933
04:01:47,340 --> 04:01:51,845
LIAM: I don't know what your hit points are, guys,
I'm going to go on the honor code here. Five

3934
04:01:51,845 --> 04:01:54,424
points? You feel a dagger sink into your back.

3935
04:01:54,424 --> 04:02:01,655
LAURA: Wait! No! If I roll a d20, I determine
whether the attack hits me or another one of my

3936
04:02:01,655 --> 04:02:02,751
duplicates.

3937
04:02:02,751 --> 04:02:07,925
LIAM: Well there you go, I don't know that spell,
sorry. The mirror image next to you goes

3938
04:02:08,022 --> 04:02:09,295
(sizzling).

3939
04:02:09,295 --> 04:02:11,219
LAURA: (gasps) Oh shit.

3940
04:02:11,219 --> 04:02:12,547
TRAVIS: I thought she has to roll a d20?

3941
04:02:12,547 --> 04:02:18,478
LAURA: Yeah, wait, I have to roll a d20. If I roll
a six or higher, then it attacks a duplicate. The

3942
04:02:18,478 --> 04:02:25,278
duplicate's AC equals ten plus my dexterity
modifier, so 11.

3943
04:02:25,278 --> 04:02:26,658
MARY: Well he rolled a 17.

3944
04:02:26,658 --> 04:02:32,614
LAURA: So it would've hit it, but that's if--
Whoa, if I roll a six or higher and I rolled a

3945
04:02:32,614 --> 04:02:38,115
six. So if an attack hits a duplicate the
duplicate is destroyed!

3946
04:02:38,115 --> 04:02:45,025
LIAM: Okay, you still don't know which one is the
real one. I mean, I know you do, but Tarvis

3947
04:02:45,025 --> 04:02:46,427
doesn't know which one is real.

3948
04:02:46,427 --> 04:02:47,795
SAM: Tarvis is pretty dumb.

3949
04:02:47,795 --> 04:02:52,321
TRAVIS: Tarvis has an intelligence of 18, he would
probably think the two that were trying to

3950
04:02:52,321 --> 04:02:54,264
leave the room were--

3951
04:02:54,264 --> 04:02:56,499
LIAM: Okay. everybody roll for initiative right
now

3952
04:02:56,499 --> 04:02:59,807
LAURA: Oh jeez Louise.

3953
04:02:59,807 --> 04:03:00,961
ASHLY: 20.

3954
04:03:00,961 --> 04:03:03,086
LIAM: Wait, everybody roll and then 20 to 25?

3955
04:03:03,086 --> 04:03:04,178
ASHLY and LAURA: 20.

3956
04:03:04,178 --> 04:03:05,202
SAM: 24.

3957
04:03:05,202 --> 04:03:08,309
LIAM: 24. Obby, Dren is 20?

3958
04:03:08,309 --> 04:03:09,182
ASHLY: Yes.

3959
04:03:09,182 --> 04:03:10,830
LIAM: Okay, next? 15 to 20.

3960
04:03:10,830 --> 04:03:12,112
LAURA: 20 as well.

3961
04:03:12,112 --> 04:03:16,674
LIAM: 20 as well. Okay, ten to 15.

3962
04:03:16,674 --> 04:03:18,645
TRAVIS: 15.

3963
04:03:18,645 --> 04:03:21,401
LIAM: Okay, and that leaves Del?

3964
04:03:21,401 --> 04:03:25,621
MARY: Seven for me.

3965
04:03:25,621 --> 04:03:28,058
LIAM: Obby, what would you like to do in this
moment?

3966
04:03:28,058 --> 04:03:31,866
SAM: I would like to attack one of the to be
determined duplicates.

3967
04:03:31,866 --> 04:03:33,379
LIAM: Okay.

3968
04:03:33,379 --> 04:03:38,942
LAURA: Oh no, you aimed at me.

3969
04:03:38,942 --> 04:03:40,746
SAM: 16.

3970
04:03:40,746 --> 04:03:41,973
LAURA: You hit me.

3971
04:03:41,973 --> 04:03:43,401
LIAM: Roll for damage.

3972
04:03:43,401 --> 04:03:48,767
SAM: Seven.

3973
04:03:48,767 --> 04:03:50,865
LAURA: Okay, seven damage?

3974
04:03:50,865 --> 04:03:52,024
SAM: Seven damage.

3975
04:03:52,024 --> 04:04:01,320
LAURA: Would I have any idea how to actually get
out of this room?

3976
04:04:01,320 --> 04:04:08,951
LIAM: No, not in this second.

3977
04:04:08,951 --> 04:04:10,673
ASHLY: Are the doors still slammed shut?

3978
04:04:10,673 --> 04:04:14,452
TRAVIS: Oh, the doors are sealed closed.

3979
04:04:14,452 --> 04:04:20,637
ASHLY: Are the doors still sealed shut? Oh shit.

3980
04:04:20,637 --> 04:04:23,107
LAURA: Do you have the ledger in your hands?

3981
04:04:23,107 --> 04:04:26,989
TRAVIS: I do, I tucked it away. It's not in my
hands, I tucked away.

3982
04:04:26,989 --> 04:04:29,937
ASHLY: Well depends whose turn it is.

3983
04:04:29,937 --> 04:04:34,632
LIAM: It's currently, fuck these 'D' names! It is
Dren's turn.

3984
04:04:34,632 --> 04:04:37,396
ASHLY: Could I try to steal it from Tarvis?

3985
04:04:37,396 --> 04:04:38,943
LIAM: Steal the--

3986
04:04:38,943 --> 04:04:40,155
ASHLY: The ledger.

3987
04:04:40,155 --> 04:04:41,360
SAM: Sleight of hand.

3988
04:04:41,360 --> 04:04:42,430
LIAM: Sure.

3989
04:04:42,430 --> 04:04:44,582
ASHLY: Am I close enough to just do it?

3990
04:04:44,582 --> 04:04:47,744
SAM: But you're one of us, you're one of the
Clasp.

3991
04:04:47,744 --> 04:04:49,444
TRAVIS: She's in love with Devan.

3992
04:04:49,444 --> 04:04:52,477
LIAM: You move over ten feet and what do you do?

3993
04:04:52,477 --> 04:04:54,259
ASHLY: I try to steal the ledger.

3994
04:04:54,259 --> 04:04:56,022
LIAM: Make a sleight of hand check.

3995
04:04:56,022 --> 04:04:58,548
ASHLY: 18.

3996
04:04:58,548 --> 04:05:00,664
LIAM: Make a perception check.

3997
04:05:00,664 --> 04:05:03,827
ASHLY: Come on, ones.

3998
04:05:03,827 --> 04:05:05,758
MARY: Ooh!

3999
04:05:05,758 --> 04:05:14,009
LIAM: Dren runs forward and slams into you and
says, "Don't worry, I've got this." As you say

4000
04:05:14,009 --> 04:05:20,486
that, you pull the book out and stick it up your
shirt and hold your weapon out.

4001
04:05:20,486 --> 04:05:23,617
ASHLY: Okay, now what do I do?

4002
04:05:23,617 --> 04:05:25,137
LIAM: That's all you do.

4003
04:05:25,137 --> 04:05:26,173
ASHLY: That's all I do? Okay.

4004
04:05:26,173 --> 04:05:27,303
LIAM: You can move a little if you want.

4005
04:05:27,303 --> 04:05:30,385
ASHLY: Can I try and dash forward?

4006
04:05:30,385 --> 04:05:37,170
LIAM: Yes, you have three movement left and your
dash as a bonus action is another five, so you can

4007
04:05:37,170 --> 04:05:39,243
go eight. Where do you want to go?

4008
04:05:39,243 --> 04:05:48,713
ASHLY: Toward Devan, but I don't know which one is
the real one.

4009
04:05:48,713 --> 04:05:51,049
TRAVIS: Yeah, you don't, none of us do.

4010
04:05:51,049 --> 04:05:52,151
SAM: Roll that d20.

4011
04:05:52,151 --> 04:05:53,323
LAURA: Should I?

4012
04:05:53,323 --> 04:05:55,097
TRAVIS: How would she know?!

4013
04:05:55,097 --> 04:06:02,461
ASHLY: I'll give it away, though, won't I? Right,
I don't want to give it away. I'll run as far as I

4014
04:06:02,461 --> 04:06:04,068
can to the opposite side of the room.

4015
04:06:04,068 --> 04:06:05,452
LIAM: Okay, here.

4016
04:06:05,452 --> 04:06:11,270
MARY: All right, could you tell me who everybody
is?

4017
04:06:11,270 --> 04:06:18,074
LIAM: It is now Devan's turn. Here is Dren. Here
is Devan. Here is Delweth. Here's Tarvis. Here's

4018
04:06:18,074 --> 04:06:19,049
Obby.

4019
04:06:19,049 --> 04:06:20,264
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

4020
04:06:20,264 --> 04:06:21,687
SAM and LIAM: Obby the Rat!

4021
04:06:21,687 --> 04:06:24,127
ASHLY: Is it your turn?

4022
04:06:24,127 --> 04:06:34,425
LAURA: It's my turn. I don't have any idea how to
get out of this room.

4023
04:06:34,425 --> 04:06:38,181
SAM: Can you Misty?

4024
04:06:38,181 --> 04:06:40,127
LAURA: No, I really can't.

4025
04:06:40,127 --> 04:06:41,497
TRAVIS: Don't help her.

4026
04:06:41,497 --> 04:06:42,904
SAM: She's my family.

4027
04:06:42,904 --> 04:06:55,107
LAURA: Oh god. Okay, I'm going to use two more of my
sorcery points and get another level one spell and

4028
04:06:55,107 --> 04:07:00,476
I'm going to cast Color Spray at the three of
them.

4029
04:07:00,476 --> 04:07:07,330
LIAM: Okay, no, you're confusing them. So you turn
this way.

4030
04:07:07,330 --> 04:07:09,434
MARY: Describe Color Spray, what does it do?

4031
04:07:09,434 --> 04:07:12,499
LAURA: Color Spray is a dazzling array of flashing
colored light.

4032
04:07:12,499 --> 04:07:14,447
MARY: Lot of color tonight.

4033
04:07:14,447 --> 04:07:24,899
LAURA: Creatures in a 15-foot cone originating
from me. Is there any way to get all three in the cone?

4034
04:07:24,899 --> 04:07:26,564
LIAM: 15-foot cone?

4035
04:07:26,564 --> 04:07:30,165
LAURA: Yeah.

4036
04:07:30,165 --> 04:07:31,280
LIAM: No.

4037
04:07:31,280 --> 04:07:32,253
LAURA: Who can I get?

4038
04:07:32,253 --> 04:07:33,650
LIAM: If you want to move forward, you can get
them together.

4039
04:07:33,650 --> 04:07:34,679
LAURA: Okay, I'll get them.

4040
04:07:34,679 --> 04:07:36,521
MARY: What does it do to us? Just blinds us?

4041
04:07:36,521 --> 04:07:39,308
LAURA: So I'm going to roll 6d10.

4042
04:07:39,308 --> 04:07:41,363
SAM: Holy shit!

4043
04:07:41,363 --> 04:07:43,311
LAURA: No, no it doesn't do that.

4044
04:07:43,311 --> 04:07:50,703
SAM: 6d10?!

4045
04:07:50,703 --> 04:07:52,898
LIAM: It's not damage.

4046
04:07:52,898 --> 04:07:55,710
SAM: Is it for what color it is?

4047
04:07:55,710 --> 04:08:03,355
LAURA: And then it makes you go blind if I get
you, if your hit points are low enough.

4048
04:08:03,355 --> 04:08:05,517
LIAM: Delweth, how many hit points do you have
right now?

4049
04:08:05,517 --> 04:08:07,801
MARY: How many hit points do I have left?

4050
04:08:07,801 --> 04:08:08,763
LIAM: Yeah.

4051
04:08:08,763 --> 04:08:09,712
MARY: 26.

4052
04:08:09,712 --> 04:08:11,494
LIAM: Tarvis, how many do you have?

4053
04:08:11,494 --> 04:08:13,494
LAURA: Three? You have three hit points?

4054
04:08:13,494 --> 04:08:23,380
Yes, so that's one, two, three, four, five,
so I have one more. That's nine plus nine is 18,

4055
04:08:23,380 --> 04:08:33,247
(counting) plus nine is 32.

4056
04:08:33,247 --> 04:08:42,371
LIAM: A rainbow erupts from her hands and arms.
Blasts you guys in the eyes, it scorches and all

4057
04:08:42,371 --> 04:08:46,268
you see is white. All you see is white. You are
both blind.

4058
04:08:46,268 --> 04:08:52,499
TRAVIS: All three of us are blind?

4059
04:08:52,499 --> 04:09:03,503
LIAM: Just you two. Obby can see. Fuck a duck,
where did I put my initiative order? Oh my god,

4060
04:09:03,503 --> 04:09:09,791
it's the end of the world. Oh man. Dren and
Delweth both went right?

4061
04:09:09,791 --> 04:09:11,290
MARY: I haven't gone yet.

4062
04:09:11,290 --> 04:09:14,673
LIAM: Dangit, you go, Delweth. That's right
somewhere on one of these papers is the order.

4063
04:09:14,673 --> 04:09:16,112
LAURA: Yeah.

4064
04:09:16,112 --> 04:09:17,877
SAM: I was first.

4065
04:09:17,877 --> 04:09:20,147
MARY: All right.

4066
04:09:20,147 --> 04:09:22,954
LIAM: Delweth, go for now.

4067
04:09:22,954 --> 04:09:24,080
MARY: All right.

4068
04:09:24,080 --> 04:09:27,195
LAURA: Yeah, it was your turn, it's your turn
next.

4069
04:09:27,195 --> 04:09:34,135
MARY: No, I know, I'm trying to figure out what to do.
Why are you looking at me like that?

4070
04:09:34,135 --> 04:09:37,034
TRAVIS: Are you going to be a fucking
Lannister or you going to be a Gryffindor right now?

4071
04:09:37,034 --> 04:09:38,867
LIAM: No, it's not Delweth's turn right now it
is--

4072
04:09:38,867 --> 04:09:42,656
MARY: I haven't gone. I had seven. I was the
last.

4073
04:09:42,656 --> 04:09:45,460
ASHLY: I went, because I stole the ledger.

4074
04:09:45,460 --> 04:09:46,739
LIAM: Okay, go for it Delweth.

4075
04:09:46,739 --> 04:09:57,126
MARY: All right, I am going to-- fuck. I don't
know what to do.

4076
04:09:57,126 --> 04:09:59,665
LIAM: Bad scene, man.

4077
04:09:59,665 --> 04:10:02,216
MARY: I am going to--

4078
04:10:02,216 --> 04:10:07,026
LIAM: You can do anything with disadvantage at
this point.

4079
04:10:07,026 --> 04:10:21,065
MARY: All right. I'm going to, 60 feet, Acid
Splash. In my brain, try and remember where I saw

4080
04:10:21,065 --> 04:10:28,600
Devan, and I'm going to blindly cast Acid Splash.

4081
04:10:28,600 --> 04:10:42,335
LIAM: All right, roll a ranged spell attack. You
add your modifier. No, actually, sorry, Devan, you

4082
04:10:42,335 --> 04:10:44,472
make a dex save at advantage.

4083
04:10:44,472 --> 04:10:49,733
LAURA: Okay. Natural 20!

4084
04:10:49,733 --> 04:10:57,599
LIAM: Okay, you see a glob of acid sizzling, and you
drop to your butt and let it fly over your head.

4085
04:10:57,599 --> 04:10:58,972
And it sizzles.

4086
04:10:58,972 --> 04:11:03,276
LAURA: Does it sizzle near the sigil?

4087
04:11:03,276 --> 04:11:08,779
LIAM: No, it does not sizzle near the siggle. And
now it is Tarvis's turn.

4088
04:11:08,779 --> 04:11:10,201
MARY: Do I get a bonus action?

4089
04:11:10,201 --> 04:11:11,202
LIAM: Sure.

4090
04:11:11,202 --> 04:11:18,682
MARY: I'm going to take three steps to my left and
try and find the wall.

4091
04:11:18,682 --> 04:11:21,737
LIAM: You're right here, and your back is against
the wall.

4092
04:11:21,737 --> 04:11:24,530
MARY: All right, I'm going to slide three steps to
my left against the wall.

4093
04:11:24,530 --> 04:11:28,143
LIAM: Okay, you can feel you're brushing past
Tarvis as you go.

4094
04:11:28,143 --> 04:11:29,340
MARY: Okay.

4095
04:11:29,340 --> 04:11:33,592
LIAM: Okay. Tarvis, it's your turn.

4096
04:11:33,592 --> 04:11:41,284
TRAVIS: I have two daggers left, so I'm going to
take a second one and chuck it in the direction

4097
04:11:41,284 --> 04:11:43,233
that I think Devan was in.

4098
04:11:43,233 --> 04:11:44,975
LIAM: You hear her butt hit the ground.

4099
04:11:44,975 --> 04:11:46,305
TRAVIS: It's at disadvantage, right?

4100
04:11:46,305 --> 04:11:47,210
LIAM: Yeah.

4101
04:11:47,210 --> 04:11:53,356
TRAVIS: Yeah, the butt thumping. 12.

4102
04:11:53,356 --> 04:11:59,301
LAURA: I have 11. Wait! Wait, no, I still have
mirror images!

4103
04:11:59,301 --> 04:12:00,421
TRAVIS: Are they up?

4104
04:12:00,421 --> 04:12:01,410
LAURA: Yeah.

4105
04:12:01,410 --> 04:12:02,544
LIAM: Yup, two of them are up.

4106
04:12:02,544 --> 04:12:03,910
SAM: He can't see any of them.

4107
04:12:03,910 --> 04:12:06,803
LAURA: It's a seven, so he still would've rolled
for an attack on that.

4108
04:12:06,803 --> 04:12:07,954
LIAM: Okay.

4109
04:12:07,954 --> 04:12:10,494
MARY: I thought it was six or less.

4110
04:12:10,494 --> 04:12:11,595
SAM: Six or higher.

4111
04:12:11,595 --> 04:12:13,624
MARY: Six or higher, you're fine.

4112
04:12:13,624 --> 04:12:14,775
LAURA: Yeah, and I rolled a seven.

4113
04:12:14,775 --> 04:12:16,823
TRAVIS: Seven on the mirror image.

4114
04:12:16,823 --> 04:12:19,923
LAURA: So one of them disappears, there's only one
mirror image left.

4115
04:12:19,923 --> 04:12:24,450
LIAM: Poof, okay. Knife sinks into the back of a
fake and goes (poof) like a Naruto clone.

4116
04:12:24,450 --> 04:12:29,570
TRAVIS: Are you dead yet? You will be soon, you
conniving bitch!

4117
04:12:29,570 --> 04:12:30,812
LIAM: Obby, you're up.

4118
04:12:30,812 --> 04:12:35,902
SAM: Obby the Rat takes no joy in this--

4119
04:12:35,902 --> 04:12:40,410
TRAVIS: Wait! And my bonus action. I will take my
superior healing potion.

4120
04:12:40,410 --> 04:12:41,934
LAURA: Damn it!

4121
04:12:41,934 --> 04:12:44,522
TRAVIS: I need an eight.

4122
04:12:44,522 --> 04:12:47,728
LAURA: Damn it.

4123
04:12:47,728 --> 04:12:50,928
TRAVIS: You guys go ahead, sorry.

4124
04:12:50,928 --> 04:12:52,188
LIAM: Yeah, Obby the Rat.

4125
04:12:52,188 --> 04:13:00,115
SAM: I take no joy in attacking you, but it is my
duty, I'm sorry. 20.

4126
04:13:00,115 --> 04:13:01,635
LIAM: What did you attack with?

4127
04:13:01,635 --> 04:13:02,798
SAM and LIAM: The dagger.

4128
04:13:02,798 --> 04:13:04,327
SAM: I throw dagger.

4129
04:13:04,327 --> 04:13:05,988
LIAM: What happens with your last image?

4130
04:13:05,988 --> 04:13:09,311
LAURA: He hits the mirror image!

4131
04:13:09,311 --> 04:13:13,259
MARY: Wait, my superior is only 8d4.

4132
04:13:13,259 --> 04:13:15,012
TRAVIS: Superior is 8d8, right? 8d8 plus six?

4133
04:13:15,012 --> 04:13:16,265
LIAM: Yeah, 8d8 plus eight.

4134
04:13:16,265 --> 04:13:17,793
LAURA: No, 8d4.

4135
04:13:17,793 --> 04:13:19,090
LIAM: 8d4 plus eight.

4136
04:13:19,090 --> 04:13:20,185
TRAVIS: Ours say 8d8.

4137
04:13:20,185 --> 04:13:21,468
LIAM: It's supposed to be 8d4.

4138
04:13:21,468 --> 04:13:22,644
TRAVIS: Okay. Son of a bitch.

4139
04:13:22,644 --> 04:13:25,038
MARY: 8d4!

4140
04:13:25,038 --> 04:13:30,037
SAM: So I hit the mirror image, even though I saw
her shoot rainbows out of her hands?

4141
04:13:30,037 --> 04:13:32,265
LAURA: The mirror image shot rainbows from its
hands, too.

4142
04:13:32,265 --> 04:13:33,483
SAM: All right, fine.

4143
04:13:33,483 --> 04:13:35,028
LIAM: Like a kaleidoscope. It was amazing.

4144
04:13:35,028 --> 04:13:36,584
SAM: Colors I don't like.

4145
04:13:36,584 --> 04:13:38,515
LIAM: Dren, you are up.

4146
04:13:38,515 --> 04:13:42,265
ASHLY: Can everyone see now? Or is everyone still
blind?

4147
04:13:42,265 --> 04:13:43,714
LAURA: No, they're still blind until their next
turn.

4148
04:13:43,714 --> 04:13:48,733
SAM: Oh, and I used some movement to go a
little bit closer to her.

4149
04:13:48,733 --> 04:13:50,001
LIAM: This way?

4150
04:13:50,001 --> 04:13:51,008
SAM: Yeah.

4151
04:13:51,008 --> 04:13:56,944
ASHLY: So they still can't see?

4152
04:13:56,944 --> 04:14:00,057
LIAM: It doesn't look like they can see.

4153
04:14:00,057 --> 04:14:01,228
ASHLY: Okay.

4154
04:14:01,228 --> 04:14:06,130
LIAM: I'm going to give you an eight-count.

4155
04:14:06,130 --> 04:14:17,920
ASHLY: Okay. I hold up the ledger and I go, Stop!
Everyone stop fighting. If anyone makes another

4156
04:14:17,920 --> 04:14:19,801
move, I'm going to rip this ledger to shreds.

4157
04:14:19,801 --> 04:14:24,221
SAM: Are we here for the ledger, Tarvis, or the
jewel?

4158
04:14:24,221 --> 04:14:26,352
ASHLY: I also have the emerald. I have both things
currently.

4159
04:14:26,352 --> 04:14:27,791
MARY: You have the emerald as well?

4160
04:14:27,791 --> 04:14:28,710
ASHLY: Yes.

4161
04:14:28,710 --> 04:14:30,412
MARY: What the fuck are we here for, Tarvis?

4162
04:14:30,412 --> 04:14:34,034
TRAVIS: The emerald. You can tear up the ledger.

4163
04:14:34,034 --> 04:14:41,065
ASHLY: Can I shatter the emerald, can I do that,
is the emerald destroyable?

4164
04:14:41,065 --> 04:14:43,440
LIAM: Sure.

4165
04:14:43,440 --> 04:14:45,406
ASHLY: Then I'll destroy the emerald.

4166
04:14:45,406 --> 04:14:46,597
LIAM: Is that your action?

4167
04:14:46,597 --> 04:14:50,100
ASHLY: I'm threatening to, unless everyone stands
down.

4168
04:14:50,100 --> 04:14:52,309
SAM: Dren, you are one of us, why are you doing
this?

4169
04:14:52,309 --> 04:14:53,956
ASHLY: Because I love Devan!

4170
04:14:53,956 --> 04:14:57,210
SAM: What are you talking about, she's a gir--
ooh.

4171
04:14:57,210 --> 04:15:04,101
TRAVIS: You know that if you leave here, no matter
where you go, we will find you, and we will kill you.

4172
04:15:04,101 --> 04:15:07,303
LAURA: It doesn't matter, I'll take care of her, I
have a lot of magic.

4173
04:15:07,303 --> 04:15:10,515
TRAVIS: That's coming out of a dead woman as
well.

4174
04:15:10,515 --> 04:15:15,155
SAM: Dren, she has betrayed her own family, don't
you think she will betray you too over gambling

4175
04:15:15,155 --> 04:15:23,140
debts? I live with my wife, her mother, her
mother, and her mother, and I hate them all, but

4176
04:15:23,140 --> 04:15:28,877
we all get along because we are family. She will
lie and stab you in the back.

4177
04:15:28,877 --> 04:15:30,598
LAURA: I would never!

4178
04:15:30,598 --> 04:15:33,463
MARY: She will, she told me she would when we were
alone together.

4179
04:15:33,463 --> 04:15:34,653
LAURA: No, I did not.

4180
04:15:34,653 --> 04:15:35,746
MARY: Yes, she did.

4181
04:15:35,746 --> 04:15:41,007
LAURA: No, I didn't. Delweth, you said you would protect me.
She told me she was going to protect me.

4182
04:15:41,007 --> 04:15:43,278
MARY: She told me that she was going to kill
everyone.

4183
04:15:43,278 --> 04:15:48,161
ASHLY: Look, you guys, I don't want anyone to get
hurt! The truth is I always wanted to be a poet,

4184
04:15:48,161 --> 04:15:59,661
but my father forced me to be an assassin rogue. I
don't even want this emerald. I just want Devan

4185
04:15:59,661 --> 04:16:02,158
and I to be able to go and live our lives in
peace.

4186
04:16:02,158 --> 04:16:05,312
TRAVIS: If you smash that emerald, you will not
walk out of here alive.

4187
04:16:05,312 --> 04:16:07,654
ASHLY: If I give you the emerald, will you let us
go?

4188
04:16:07,654 --> 04:16:09,624
SAM: By the way, Tarvis, you're talking to the
wall right now.

4189
04:16:09,624 --> 04:16:12,736
(laughter)

4190
04:16:12,736 --> 04:16:18,416
LIAM: During the conversation, it fades away.

4191
04:16:18,416 --> 04:16:19,660
LAURA: Aw, man.

4192
04:16:19,660 --> 04:16:22,010
MARY: Throw me the idol? Give me the whip?

4193
04:16:22,010 --> 04:16:24,800
SAM: We've got a little Mexican standoff here.

4194
04:16:24,800 --> 04:16:26,900
(laughter)

4195
04:16:26,900 --> 04:16:31,650
MARY: All right. What do we do? Get the emerald?

4196
04:16:31,650 --> 04:16:35,474
ASHLY: You guys open that hatch and I won't
shatter the emerald.

4197
04:16:35,474 --> 04:16:37,672
MARY: What hatch? We don't know how to get--

4198
04:16:37,672 --> 04:16:40,792
ASHLY: The thing in the middle! The thing that
Abby was trying to open.

4199
04:16:40,792 --> 04:16:42,864
SAM: Obby! Obby the Rat!

4200
04:16:42,864 --> 04:16:45,021
MARY: We should kill her for not knowing your
name.

4201
04:16:45,021 --> 04:16:49,638
SAM: I can open any door, I can open that door if
that's what you want open, but we need that

4202
04:16:49,638 --> 04:16:50,747
jewel.

4203
04:16:50,747 --> 04:16:56,211
ASHLY: If you let us get down the hatch, I'll toss
it back up to you.

4204
04:16:56,211 --> 04:17:00,869
TRAVIS: I think we just kill them now.

4205
04:17:00,869 --> 04:17:01,977
SAM: Both?

4206
04:17:01,977 --> 04:17:02,886
TRAVIS: Yep.

4207
04:17:02,886 --> 04:17:06,080
LAURA: While she was talking, can I have tried to
pry open the hatch?

4208
04:17:06,080 --> 04:17:07,903
LIAM: Sure.

4209
04:17:07,903 --> 04:17:10,968
SAM: Hey, stop trying to pry open the hatch!

4210
04:17:10,968 --> 04:17:13,734
(laughter)

4211
04:17:13,734 --> 04:17:17,999
MARY: Are they both in the center of the room,
trying to pry open the hatch?

4212
04:17:17,999 --> 04:17:24,154
LIAM: I'm going to say for that she backed up, you
walked forward, you guys didn't move.

4213
04:17:24,154 --> 04:17:28,414
SAM: Tarvis, I follow orders. You tell me what to
do.

4214
04:17:28,414 --> 04:17:29,597
TRAVIS: Kill them. Now.

4215
04:17:29,597 --> 04:17:31,676
MARY: I cast Burning Hands on both of them.

4216
04:17:31,676 --> 04:17:33,126
LIAM: Everybody roll initiative again.

4217
04:17:33,126 --> 04:17:34,601
LAURA: Aw, come on.

4218
04:17:34,601 --> 04:17:35,857
SAM: Not good.

4219
04:17:35,857 --> 04:17:37,059
LIAM: 20 to 25.

4220
04:17:37,059 --> 04:17:39,950
ASHLY: 21.

4221
04:17:39,950 --> 04:17:42,009
LIAM: 15 to 20.

4222
04:17:42,009 --> 04:17:43,100
TRAVIS: 19.

4223
04:17:43,100 --> 04:17:44,182
MARY: 16.

4224
04:17:44,182 --> 04:17:45,464
LAURA: I'm going to die.

4225
04:17:45,464 --> 04:17:47,056
ASHLY: I think we both are.

4226
04:17:47,056 --> 04:17:53,137
LIAM: 16, okay. Ten to 15? Five to ten?

4227
04:17:53,137 --> 04:17:54,535
SAM: Seven.

4228
04:17:54,535 --> 04:18:03,076
LIAM: I don't have everybody. Devan, what did you
roll? Three. Dren, go.

4229
04:18:03,076 --> 04:18:05,939
ASHLY: Should I smash the emerald?

4230
04:18:05,939 --> 04:18:09,571
LIAM: Everybody can tell, everybody's moving, you
see everybody moving at the same time. What are

4231
04:18:09,571 --> 04:18:11,290
you going to do?

4232
04:18:11,290 --> 04:18:18,435
MARY: Tied together in a glorious love-- beautiful
moment.

4233
04:18:18,435 --> 04:18:24,708
ASHLY: I'm going to move in front of Devan.

4234
04:18:24,708 --> 04:18:28,621
SAM: Wait. Why are we seated at these tables?

4235
04:18:28,621 --> 04:18:31,401
(laughter)

4236
04:18:31,401 --> 04:18:33,202
MARY: It's all clear now.

4237
04:18:33,202 --> 04:18:35,946
ASHLY: And while I'm moving, can I give her the
emerald?

4238
04:18:35,946 --> 04:18:37,836
LIAM: Make a sleight of hand check.

4239
04:18:37,836 --> 04:18:41,242
ASHLY: 18.

4240
04:18:41,242 --> 04:18:44,313
LIAM: Plop it into her hands, yeah.

4241
04:18:44,313 --> 04:18:47,344
ASHLY: And then I'm going to whisper--

4242
04:18:47,344 --> 04:18:50,922
LAURA: I've got like a human head inside of my
shirt right now.

4243
04:18:50,922 --> 04:18:55,387
ASHLY: I whisper, get out of here if you can. And
then I attack Tarvis.

4244
04:18:55,387 --> 04:19:01,423
LAURA: Oh, Dren!

4245
04:19:01,423 --> 04:19:05,294
ASHLY: Am I close enough to use the shortsword?

4246
04:19:05,294 --> 04:19:11,203
LIAM: If you take one step forward, you are. Do
you want to do that?

4247
04:19:11,203 --> 04:19:18,422
ASHLY: I'm going to get so ganked. Yes. Bloop! 18
plus six.

4248
04:19:18,422 --> 04:19:19,861
LIAM: Yeah, that hits.

4249
04:19:19,861 --> 04:19:25,328
ASHLY: And then seven damage.

4250
04:19:25,328 --> 04:19:26,808
LAURA: Oh, god.

4251
04:19:26,808 --> 04:19:33,658
LIAM: Okay, blade sinks into his hip. Now we're on
to-- why can't I read these names?

4252
04:19:33,658 --> 04:19:35,252
SAM: The 'D' one.

4253
04:19:35,252 --> 04:19:36,446
MARY: I had 17.

4254
04:19:36,446 --> 04:19:37,535
TRAVIS: I had 18.

4255
04:19:37,535 --> 04:19:38,910
LIAM: Delweth, Tarvis.

4256
04:19:38,910 --> 04:19:51,213
TRAVIS: I look down at this tiny little Benedict
Arnold, and I take my scimitar and swing it. What

4257
04:19:51,213 --> 04:19:52,383
the f--!?

4258
04:19:52,383 --> 04:20:02,351
(laughter)

4259
04:20:02,351 --> 04:20:05,655
TRAVIS: And I'm overcome with nostalgia of when
she was cool.

4260
04:20:05,655 --> 04:20:12,784
LIAM: And you swing your blade down as hard as you
can, because you love the Clasp, you serve the

4261
04:20:12,784 --> 04:20:18,382
Clasp, and this little shit betrays you? You bring
your scimitar down, you go whoop, take a step to

4262
04:20:18,382 --> 04:20:23,623
the side. The scimitar hits the ground and
shatters into two pieces.

4263
04:20:23,623 --> 04:20:25,855
LAURA and ASHLY: Oh, shit!

4264
04:20:25,855 --> 04:20:27,613
LIAM: You're now holding a dagger.

4265
04:20:27,613 --> 04:20:29,419
TRAVIS: And a whip.

4266
04:20:29,419 --> 04:20:32,409
MARY: And a whip that you cut your face with.

4267
04:20:32,409 --> 04:20:33,641
LIAM: Delweth, you're up.

4268
04:20:33,641 --> 04:20:38,900
MARY: Right. Do I have a clean shot at these two?

4269
04:20:38,900 --> 04:20:41,407
LIAM: To do what?

4270
04:20:41,407 --> 04:20:45,411
MARY: To kill them. I need a 15-foot cone.

4271
04:20:45,411 --> 04:20:50,089
LIAM: You'll hit Dren.

4272
04:20:50,089 --> 04:20:53,019
MARY: I'll hit Dren. Can I move?

4273
04:20:53,019 --> 04:20:55,556
LIAM: Sure, you can move right there and do it.
Kablam.

4274
04:20:55,556 --> 04:21:00,366
MARY: Kaboom. I want to make sure it's just the
two of them in range. I cast Burning Hands.

4275
04:21:00,366 --> 04:21:01,845
LIAM: Go for it.

4276
04:21:01,845 --> 04:21:10,918
MARY: What do I have to do? Burning Hands. Each
creature must make a dexterity saving throw.

4277
04:21:10,918 --> 04:21:19,523
LIAM: Versus your DC, so your DC is 13. You've got
to beat 13 with a dex save.

4278
04:21:19,523 --> 04:21:22,643
ASHLY: 14.

4279
04:21:22,643 --> 04:21:24,214
LIAM: Yeah, you beat it.

4280
04:21:24,214 --> 04:21:25,374
LAURA: 13.

4281
04:21:25,374 --> 04:21:33,835
LIAM: You beat it. But you take half damage. So
roll for damage. Yeah. They both made the save. So

4282
04:21:33,835 --> 04:21:40,147
Delweth puts her hands together, fans out the
fingers, fire shoots out, for a total of three?

4283
04:21:40,147 --> 04:21:45,753
Four. It blasts, and if they had been human, they
would have been cooked, but because they're so

4284
04:21:45,753 --> 04:21:49,461
short, it goes over their heads as they crouch
down.

4285
04:21:49,461 --> 04:21:51,037
MARY: Yeah, you take four damage.

4286
04:21:51,037 --> 04:21:51,937
ASHLY: Four damage each?

4287
04:21:51,937 --> 04:21:53,111
MARY: Yeah.

4288
04:21:53,111 --> 04:21:54,520
LIAM: Okay, Obby the Rat, you're up.

4289
04:21:54,520 --> 04:21:57,434
TRAVIS: Go get it.

4290
04:21:57,434 --> 04:22:04,698
SAM: All right. I attack Dren. I do not like
haiku.

4291
04:22:04,698 --> 04:22:08,795
ASHLY: I've always loved you, Alby. Like a
brother.

4292
04:22:08,795 --> 04:22:12,627
(laughter)

4293
04:22:12,627 --> 04:22:19,683
SAM: You know why they call me Obby the Rat? I can
sniff out a traitor.

4294
04:22:19,683 --> 04:22:21,254
ASHLY: Really? It took you a long time.

4295
04:22:21,254 --> 04:22:23,842
SAM: I failed! Three!

4296
04:22:23,842 --> 04:22:25,349
TRAVIS: Plus what?

4297
04:22:25,349 --> 04:22:27,914
SAM: Seven? I don't know. Do you have an AC of
ten?

4298
04:22:27,914 --> 04:22:28,954
LIAM: Devan, you're up.

4299
04:22:28,954 --> 04:22:34,782
SAM: Bonus action, I disengage and run back.

4300
04:22:34,782 --> 04:22:37,302
MARY: Oh, that was mine as well.

4301
04:22:37,302 --> 04:22:47,598
LAURA: I'm going to put my bloody hand down on the
floor underneath me, and I'm going to cast Minor

4302
04:22:47,598 --> 04:22:58,612
Illusion. Oh, god. And I'm going to cast an image
of the ledger across the room, like over towards the--

4303
04:22:58,612 --> 04:23:00,363
TRAVIS: The ledger?

4304
04:23:00,363 --> 04:23:05,751
LAURA: I mean, the emerald. The emerald rolling
across the floor towards the door.

4305
04:23:05,751 --> 04:23:07,133
SAM: It can't move.

4306
04:23:07,133 --> 04:23:09,355
LAURA: It can't move?

4307
04:23:09,355 --> 04:23:13,117
SAM: The Minor Illusion, I don't think it moves.

4308
04:23:13,117 --> 04:23:16,827
LIAM: I'll allow it.

4309
04:23:16,827 --> 04:23:19,908
TRAVIS: "I'll allow it."

4310
04:23:19,908 --> 04:23:23,503
LIAM: And now we're at the top again, so Dren.

4311
04:23:23,503 --> 04:23:32,077
ASHLY: Okay. There's no situation in which I can
get a sneak attack on anyone, is there? If I dash

4312
04:23:32,077 --> 04:23:33,787
underneath anyone or--

4313
04:23:33,787 --> 04:23:35,768
LIAM: The only friend you have left is here, and
there's nowhere to hide in here.

4314
04:23:35,768 --> 04:23:37,444
TRAVIS: She's going to get you killed.

4315
04:23:37,444 --> 04:23:46,412
ASHLY: I'll do it for love. I'm going to attack
Tarvis again. 17.

4316
04:23:46,412 --> 04:23:47,697
LIAM: Hits.

4317
04:23:47,697 --> 04:23:53,618
ASHLY: What am I doing? d6. Seven.

4318
04:23:53,618 --> 04:23:58,674
LIAM: You feel the blood, hot.

4319
04:23:58,674 --> 04:24:01,187
TRAVIS: As hot as my rage.

4320
04:24:01,187 --> 04:24:02,655
LIAM: Tarvis, you're up.

4321
04:24:02,655 --> 04:24:09,029
TRAVIS: Again, I try to hit something with a pulse.

4322
04:24:09,029 --> 04:24:11,316
LIAM: With your broken, weird dagger, or the
whip?

4323
04:24:11,316 --> 04:24:19,502
TRAVIS: With the whip! That'll hit, 19.

4324
04:24:19,502 --> 04:24:20,805
LIAM: That hits.

4325
04:24:20,805 --> 04:24:28,667
TRAVIS: Thank you, Jesus. A one plus two for a
whopping fucking three.

4326
04:24:28,667 --> 04:24:30,789
MARY: We suck!

4327
04:24:30,789 --> 04:24:35,151
LIAM: You feel a sting, a cut on your neck, and
blood starts to pour lightly down your neck.

4328
04:24:35,151 --> 04:24:38,499
TRAVIS: As a bonus action, I will take a greater
healing potion.

4329
04:24:38,499 --> 04:24:43,193
LIAM: Man, this is a long game. Wow.

4330
04:24:43,193 --> 04:24:45,305
SAM: Shouldn't have given us so many potions.

4331
04:24:45,305 --> 04:24:49,356
MARY: I know. One each. That's all you need. I
don't know.

4332
04:24:49,356 --> 04:24:54,082
TRAVIS: Continue.

4333
04:24:54,082 --> 04:24:55,859
LIAM: Okay. Next is Delweth.

4334
04:24:55,859 --> 04:24:57,167
MARY: Fuck. Really?

4335
04:24:57,167 --> 04:24:58,268
LIAM: Yeah.

4336
04:24:58,268 --> 04:25:02,600
MARY: Who's that right over the grate?

4337
04:25:02,600 --> 04:25:04,388
LIAM: That is Devan.

4338
04:25:04,388 --> 04:25:08,205
TRAVIS: (strained) You can sneak attack on Dren
because I'm engaged with her.

4339
04:25:08,205 --> 04:25:09,308
MARY: Oh, all right.

4340
04:25:09,308 --> 04:25:10,923
SAM: If you attack with a weapon.

4341
04:25:10,923 --> 04:25:12,963
MARY: I'm going to attack Dren with my rapier.

4342
04:25:12,963 --> 04:25:15,230
LIAM: Okay, so you're going to move up.

4343
04:25:15,230 --> 04:25:18,256
MARY: Yes, get sneak attack. What do I do?

4344
04:25:18,256 --> 04:25:19,507
LIAM: Roll to attack.

4345
04:25:19,507 --> 04:25:21,341
MARY: Just roll this?

4346
04:25:21,341 --> 04:25:22,856
LIAM: Yes, roll to attack first.

4347
04:25:22,856 --> 04:25:27,220
TRAVIS: What are the motherfuck-- I don't know
what--

4348
04:25:27,220 --> 04:25:31,655
MARY: I missed, I had a three.

4349
04:25:31,655 --> 04:25:34,005
LIAM: Do you want to do anything else with a
bonus action?

4350
04:25:34,005 --> 04:25:36,106
MARY: I'd like to kill myself.

4351
04:25:36,106 --> 04:25:40,403
(laughter)

4352
04:25:40,403 --> 04:25:45,645
MARY: I'm going to stay where I am.

4353
04:25:45,645 --> 04:25:47,793
LIAM: Okay, Obby, you're up.

4354
04:25:47,793 --> 04:25:57,072
SAM: I run over to Devan. I stab her in belly with
dagger. I roll four.

4355
04:25:57,072 --> 04:26:00,205
(laughter)

4356
04:26:00,205 --> 04:26:01,982
LIAM: Devan, you're up.

4357
04:26:01,982 --> 04:26:09,419
SAM: Wait, with bonus action, sleight of hand, I
attempt to remove her pouch with healing potions.

4358
04:26:09,419 --> 04:26:10,779
LIAM: Roll.

4359
04:26:10,779 --> 04:26:13,578
SAM: I roll five.

4360
04:26:13,578 --> 04:26:16,538
(laughter)

4361
04:26:16,538 --> 04:26:18,289
LIAM: Devan, go.

4362
04:26:18,289 --> 04:26:21,236
LAURA: I keep my hand with the blood on the sigil
on the ground. I don't know if it's doing

4363
04:26:21,236 --> 04:26:22,301
anything.

4364
04:26:22,301 --> 04:26:23,893
LIAM: It doesn't feel like anything's doing.

4365
04:26:23,893 --> 04:26:34,565
LAURA: Shit! I guess then I'll do Ray of Frost up
at Obby's face.

4366
04:26:34,565 --> 04:26:35,872
LIAM: Go.

4367
04:26:35,872 --> 04:26:46,877
LAURA: I'm going to use a blue one, because it's
frosty. That would be 31. No, wait, no, that's a lie.

4368
04:26:46,877 --> 04:26:49,482
That's such a lie. 23.

4369
04:26:49,482 --> 04:26:50,663
LIAM: Hits.

4370
04:26:50,663 --> 04:26:52,280
MARY: Still really good.

4371
04:26:52,280 --> 04:27:01,091
LAURA: So that's 1d8, then. That's three. That's
it?

4372
04:27:01,091 --> 04:27:02,667
LIAM: That's it.

4373
04:27:02,667 --> 04:27:07,957
TRAVIS: We're like a bunch of drunks trying to
kill each other with foam noodles.

4374
04:27:07,957 --> 04:27:15,621
LAURA: And I say, look! Look! The jewel is yours!
Why are you still attacking me? I don't even want it!

4375
04:27:15,621 --> 04:27:21,228
LIAM: You do see the jewel across the room. Dren,
you're up.

4376
04:27:21,228 --> 04:27:26,180
ASHLY: Does it take anything to roll perception to
see if there's anything I can do to this thing on

4377
04:27:26,180 --> 04:27:28,068
the ground? Or to see if there's any other way to
get out?

4378
04:27:28,068 --> 04:27:33,423
LIAM: You can, sure. That'll be your whole action
and move if you want. You can do a perception

4379
04:27:33,423 --> 04:27:34,981
check if you want, though.

4380
04:27:34,981 --> 04:27:45,530
ASHLY: My perception is bunk. There's no sweeping
attacks I can do, I'm assuming. I can't do a crazy

4381
04:27:45,530 --> 04:27:46,747
flourish?

4382
04:27:46,747 --> 04:27:51,014
LIAM: No. You can disengage to get away out of
that little kill box, and then I'd let you do

4383
04:27:51,014 --> 04:27:52,598
perception if you want.

4384
04:27:52,598 --> 04:27:53,830
LAURA: That sounds smart.

4385
04:27:53,830 --> 04:28:00,301
ASHLY: Yeah, I'm going to move out of the kill
box. Disengage. I guess next to Devan.

4386
04:28:00,301 --> 04:28:01,393
LIAM: Here?

4387
04:28:01,393 --> 04:28:04,542
ASHLY: Sure. And then I'll do a perception.

4388
04:28:04,542 --> 04:28:06,019
LIAM: Perception check, roll.

4389
04:28:06,019 --> 04:28:11,824
ASHLY: (singing) Son of a bitch. If only it had
been a one. It's a two.

4390
04:28:11,824 --> 04:28:18,880
LIAM: It's a two? I don't know, man, it's hectic
in here. On to Tarvis.

4391
04:28:18,880 --> 04:28:29,384
TRAVIS: I run up to Devan, and I look at Dren, and
I say, this is your last chance. If you don't give

4392
04:28:29,384 --> 04:28:38,710
her up, I'm going to paralyze her and torture her
in front of you for a week. And then maybe I'll

4393
04:28:38,710 --> 04:28:42,737
let her die. I attack Devan.

4394
04:28:42,737 --> 04:28:44,464
LAURA: Me?

4395
04:28:44,464 --> 04:28:50,435
TRAVIS: Yes, you! 17!

4396
04:28:50,435 --> 04:28:52,721
LAURA: That hits me.

4397
04:28:52,721 --> 04:28:54,824
TRAVIS: And I get sneak attack on it.

4398
04:28:54,824 --> 04:28:56,155
LIAM: Yep.

4399
04:28:56,155 --> 04:29:05,372
TRAVIS: Hey, it's me. Six. Seven. Ten.

4400
04:29:05,372 --> 04:29:09,406
SAM: Hey! That's some real damage.

4401
04:29:09,406 --> 04:29:13,203
TRAVIS: Think about it. Think about the offer. I'm
talking bad torture.

4402
04:29:13,203 --> 04:29:14,849
LIAM: Delweth, you're up.

4403
04:29:14,849 --> 04:29:16,041
MARY: Fuck me. Okay.

4404
04:29:16,041 --> 04:29:21,369
TRAVIS: Plus, you'll live.

4405
04:29:21,369 --> 04:29:26,681
ASHLY: I will? I don't believe that for a second.
I stabbed you twice!

4406
04:29:26,681 --> 04:29:28,430
TRAVIS: Death's a certainty.

4407
04:29:28,430 --> 04:29:35,382
MARY: I am a member of the Clasp, so I attack
Devan.

4408
04:29:35,382 --> 04:29:36,520
LIAM: Okay, go.

4409
04:29:36,520 --> 04:29:41,329
MARY: With my rapier! Yes. There's no sneak. Was I
behind anybody?

4410
04:29:41,329 --> 04:29:47,523
LIAM: Sneak attack because she's flanked. You roll
at advantage because she's flanked.

4411
04:29:47,523 --> 04:29:51,913
ASHLY: Do you pass out?

4412
04:29:51,913 --> 04:29:55,846
LAURA: I go unconscious, but then if they keep
hitting, I get three death saving throws.

4413
04:29:55,846 --> 04:29:57,535
SAM: Aren't you attacking with the rapier?

4414
04:29:57,535 --> 04:29:59,639
LIAM: Hits.

4415
04:29:59,639 --> 04:30:09,015
MARY: Then I do 1d8. Hey! 11.

4416
04:30:09,015 --> 04:30:10,792
TRAVIS: And sneak attack.

4417
04:30:10,792 --> 04:30:13,903
LAURA: This is it!

4418
04:30:13,903 --> 04:30:18,055
MARY: 15.

4419
04:30:18,055 --> 04:30:20,123
LIAM: Down?

4420
04:30:20,123 --> 04:30:21,724
LAURA: Zero.

4421
04:30:21,724 --> 04:30:24,352
ASHLY: Devan!

4422
04:30:24,352 --> 04:30:25,791
LIAM: Obby, you're up.

4423
04:30:25,791 --> 04:30:30,205
MARY: Do I get a bonus action? I'd like to go back
up behind Tarvis.

4424
04:30:30,205 --> 04:30:34,121
LIAM: Okay. Over here? Okay. Obby the Rat, you're
up.

4425
04:30:34,121 --> 04:30:40,327
SAM: Tarvis. Devan or Dren?

4426
04:30:40,327 --> 04:30:48,046
TRAVIS: Devan. Do it. Devan's unconscious, so it's
an automatic two death saving throws.

4427
04:30:48,046 --> 04:30:49,409
LIAM: Yeah, if you hit.

4428
04:30:49,409 --> 04:31:00,930
LAURA: All I did wrong was play some poker. Just
saying. You know it in your heart of hearts, Obby.

4429
04:31:00,930 --> 04:31:03,420
All I did was play some poker.

4430
04:31:03,420 --> 04:31:09,502
SAM: Obby follows orders. I roll a two.

4431
04:31:09,502 --> 04:31:10,828
TRAVIS: No!

4432
04:31:10,828 --> 04:31:11,901
(laughter)

4433
04:31:11,901 --> 04:31:13,150
TRAVIS: It's an automatic crit, right?

4434
04:31:13,150 --> 04:31:15,604
LIAM: Yeah. You lean in and go--

4435
04:31:15,604 --> 04:31:20,122
SAM: It just hits? So what do I roll? Is she
dead?

4436
04:31:20,122 --> 04:31:22,196
LAURA: No, I've got one more death saving throw.

4437
04:31:22,196 --> 04:31:25,252
SAM: Holy shit. That was so mean of me.

4438
04:31:25,252 --> 04:31:30,756
LIAM: You push in, and you watch her back, like a
hole wells up in her back. None of you are good

4439
04:31:30,756 --> 04:31:32,714
people. Nobody here is a good person.

4440
04:31:32,714 --> 04:31:38,246
SAM: I use sleight of hand to try and steal her
jewel from her.

4441
04:31:38,246 --> 04:31:40,096
LIAM: It's across the room on the floor.

4442
04:31:40,096 --> 04:31:43,588
LAURA: No, it's not, it would've gone away as soon
as I died.

4443
04:31:43,588 --> 04:31:50,253
LIAM: Okay. Sleight of hand? You'd have to see it. I
mean, she's probably lying on top of it.

4444
04:31:50,253 --> 04:31:53,665
SAM: Well then I take the healing potions. 19.

4445
04:31:53,665 --> 04:31:58,104
LIAM: Okay. All right, Dren, you're up.

4446
04:31:58,104 --> 04:32:02,580
LAURA: You could give me a healing potion and wake
me up.

4447
04:32:02,580 --> 04:32:07,972
TRAVIS: Think about it, Dren. Life awaits you on
the other side of this choice. You can live, drink

4448
04:32:07,972 --> 04:32:09,871
wine, find someone else.

4449
04:32:09,871 --> 04:32:12,370
ASHLY: I'm going to give Devan a healing potion.

4450
04:32:12,370 --> 04:32:15,882
LIAM: How many is it? 4d4 or 8d4?

4451
04:32:15,882 --> 04:32:17,273
ASHLY: 8d4.

4452
04:32:17,273 --> 04:32:18,617
MARY: The superior?

4453
04:32:18,617 --> 04:32:24,856
ASHLY: It's the only one I have left. You can roll
them.

4454
04:32:24,856 --> 04:32:30,804
TRAVIS: Do death saving throws reset? Do they,
Lemur?

4455
04:32:30,804 --> 04:32:39,132
LIAM: Yes. She's awake. I'm going to say, to pour
that all into her mouth and make sure it goes

4456
04:32:39,132 --> 04:32:42,922
down, that's your action. You can move if you want
to.

4457
04:32:42,922 --> 04:32:54,091
ASHLY: I can't do another perception? That would
be another action? Okay. Can I pry at the sigil?

4458
04:32:54,091 --> 04:32:57,878
LIAM: Maybe on your next turn, you can.

4459
04:32:57,878 --> 04:32:59,487
ASHLY: Okay, that's it.

4460
04:32:59,487 --> 04:33:01,524
LIAM: Okay. Tarvis, you're up.

4461
04:33:01,524 --> 04:33:07,478
TRAVIS: It's me? Great. I would like to go and
strike Devan.

4462
04:33:07,478 --> 04:33:11,784
LAURA: Wait, I didn't get to go? My turn was after
Dren's.

4463
04:33:11,784 --> 04:33:13,153
TRAVIS: You got to wake up.

4464
04:33:13,153 --> 04:33:14,916
LIAM: You're after Obby.

4465
04:33:14,916 --> 04:33:16,871
LAURA: Just kidding. I had the lowest, I forgot.

4466
04:33:16,871 --> 04:33:18,221
TRAVIS: 14.

4467
04:33:18,221 --> 04:33:19,655
LIAM: What's your AC?

4468
04:33:19,655 --> 04:33:20,730
LAURA: 11.

4469
04:33:20,730 --> 04:33:21,849
TRAVIS: Awesome.

4470
04:33:21,849 --> 04:33:24,093
SAM: Oh man, poor Laura Bailey.

4471
04:33:24,093 --> 04:33:26,675
MARY: It's not Laura Bailey, it's Devan.

4472
04:33:26,675 --> 04:33:28,448
SAM: You're right. Obby has no feelings.

4473
04:33:28,448 --> 04:33:31,662
TRAVIS: 13.

4474
04:33:31,662 --> 04:33:34,761
LIAM: Bang. You want to do a bonus action?

4475
04:33:34,761 --> 04:33:37,142
TRAVIS: Nope.

4476
04:33:37,142 --> 04:33:38,265
LIAM: Nope. Delweth.

4477
04:33:38,265 --> 04:33:45,033
MARY: Right. Going back with my rapier. I don't
have anything stronger than that, really. I'm

4478
04:33:45,033 --> 04:33:49,129
going to keep the last thing that I have. I'm
going to run up and rapier.

4479
04:33:49,129 --> 04:33:50,956
LAURA: You're going to rapier?

4480
04:33:50,956 --> 04:33:55,027
MARY: Rapier. I said rapier.

4481
04:33:55,027 --> 04:33:56,498
LIAM: Roll that die.

4482
04:33:56,498 --> 04:34:02,503
MARY: 17 plus--

4483
04:34:02,503 --> 04:34:03,795
TRAVIS: 22.

4484
04:34:03,795 --> 04:34:09,406
MARY: And then the rapier is-- (counting)

4485
04:34:09,406 --> 04:34:14,052
LAURA: I'm back to zero. It doesn't matter, I'm
back to zero.

4486
04:34:14,052 --> 04:34:17,705
LIAM: Okay, she's down. Okay. Delweth, you want to
do anything on a bonus?

4487
04:34:17,705 --> 04:34:21,965
MARY: I want to go back behind Tarvis.

4488
04:34:21,965 --> 04:34:26,418
LIAM: Okay. So you dart around, then you darted
back. Obby the Rat.

4489
04:34:26,418 --> 04:34:30,894
SAM: I turn to Dren and say, where is the jewel?
Tell me or I kill your friend right now.

4490
04:34:30,894 --> 04:34:35,066
ASHLY: You'll kill us anyway.

4491
04:34:35,066 --> 04:34:41,093
SAM: Okay. I rolled an 11 to kill Devan.

4492
04:34:41,093 --> 04:34:44,880
LAURA: Well that's two death saving throws gone.

4493
04:34:44,880 --> 04:34:48,396
LIAM: Okay. Any bonus, Obby the Rat?

4494
04:34:48,396 --> 04:34:50,228
SAM: I'm going to search her body.

4495
04:34:50,228 --> 04:34:57,402
LIAM: You get down and you start looking, and you
feel something hard. And now it is Dren's turn.

4496
04:34:57,402 --> 04:35:01,714
TRAVIS: Think about what you're doing.

4497
04:35:01,714 --> 04:35:06,411
ASHLY: I'm going to try and pry open the sigil.
Can I use one of my weapons to do it?

4498
04:35:06,411 --> 04:35:07,437
LIAM: Sure.

4499
04:35:07,437 --> 04:35:10,435
TRAVIS: Yeah, go ahead, expose your neck for us
while you're doing it.

4500
04:35:10,435 --> 04:35:12,725
LIAM: Roll a strength check.

4501
04:35:12,725 --> 04:35:18,505
ASHLY: Okay, so it's 18?

4502
04:35:18,505 --> 04:35:26,540
LIAM: Yeah, you bring it down as hard as you can,
and scratches-- it ruins the surface. It is still shut.

4503
04:35:26,540 --> 04:35:31,547
ASHLY: Okay. And that's all I can do, really,
right?

4504
04:35:31,547 --> 04:35:33,369
LIAM: You can move if you want to.

4505
04:35:33,369 --> 04:35:34,741
ASHLY: No, I'll stay right there.

4506
04:35:34,741 --> 04:35:37,474
LIAM: Okay. Tarvis, you're up.

4507
04:35:37,474 --> 04:35:41,002
TRAVIS: You betrayer. Watch her die.

4508
04:35:41,002 --> 04:35:42,819
LAURA: He's terrible.

4509
04:35:42,819 --> 04:35:44,268
SAM: Tarvis.

4510
04:35:44,268 --> 04:35:52,586
TRAVIS: And I take my dagger out, and I kneel down
over Devan, and I take the knife, and I stick it in.

4511
04:35:52,586 --> 04:35:54,768
SAM: Oh, what a dick!

4512
04:35:54,768 --> 04:35:56,592
TRAVIS: And then I--

4513
04:35:56,592 --> 04:36:01,544
LIAM: Her body jiggles on the ground.

4514
04:36:01,544 --> 04:36:06,112
LAURA: It hurts, I don't even-- like, we've only
had a one-shot and it still really sucks to die.

4515
04:36:06,112 --> 04:36:09,534
I'm dead, yo.

4516
04:36:09,534 --> 04:36:12,169
LIAM: Delweth, what would you like to do?

4517
04:36:12,169 --> 04:36:14,496
ASHLY: No!

4518
04:36:14,496 --> 04:36:19,657
MARY: I go over to your body.

4519
04:36:19,657 --> 04:36:24,013
LAURA: My body. My sad little teeny-tiny halfling
body.

4520
04:36:24,013 --> 04:36:27,983
MARY: Does she have the emerald? Is that what we
discovered?

4521
04:36:27,983 --> 04:36:29,716
SAM: I'm still searching around there.

4522
04:36:29,716 --> 04:36:34,641
LIAM: Obby's on her. As Tarvis did that, he's got
his hands on it in a split-second.

4523
04:36:34,641 --> 04:36:36,008
MARY: All right.

4524
04:36:36,008 --> 04:36:39,230
LIAM: You can surmise that that's what's going
on.

4525
04:36:39,230 --> 04:36:52,810
MARY: I turn to Dren and say, you swore an oath.
You swore an oath to the Clasp. That's what you

4526
04:36:52,810 --> 04:36:57,819
did, and you've betrayed us all. And I take my rapier
and I attack her.

4527
04:36:57,819 --> 04:37:00,099
LIAM: Okay, roll to hit.

4528
04:37:00,099 --> 04:37:05,801
SAM: We're hardened criminals, right? This is what
we do, right? It feels real wrong!

4529
04:37:05,801 --> 04:37:07,954
MARY: 19.

4530
04:37:07,954 --> 04:37:08,949
LIAM: Hits.

4531
04:37:08,949 --> 04:37:10,939
MARY: 19. Sorry, love.

4532
04:37:10,939 --> 04:37:15,482
ASHLY: You're not sorry! Is this sneak attack?

4533
04:37:15,482 --> 04:37:16,681
TRAVIS: Yeah. She's engaged, right?

4534
04:37:16,681 --> 04:37:17,979
LIAM: Yes. Yeah.

4535
04:37:17,979 --> 04:37:21,044
LAURA: Is she?

4536
04:37:21,044 --> 04:37:25,144
LIAM: But you would have to move down. No, it's
not sneak attack. No, sorry.

4537
04:37:25,144 --> 04:37:26,319
MARY: Eight.

4538
04:37:26,319 --> 04:37:40,636
LIAM: Eight, total. Okay. You slash right down her
front in a long cut across her chest. Anything else?

4539
04:37:40,636 --> 04:37:43,464
MARY: I go back behind Tarvis.

4540
04:37:43,464 --> 04:37:48,154
LIAM: All right. Obby the Rat. You dart back, you
come around go-- you slash at her and then whip

4541
04:37:48,154 --> 04:37:51,760
around, get your place. Obby the Rat.

4542
04:37:51,760 --> 04:37:52,996
SAM: Do I find the jewel?

4543
04:37:52,996 --> 04:37:54,062
LIAM: Got it.

4544
04:37:54,062 --> 04:38:03,072
SAM: Find jewel. I look at sigil on ground. Any
symbol that looks like previous symbols? How do we

4545
04:38:03,072 --> 04:38:04,368
get out of the room?

4546
04:38:04,368 --> 04:38:07,521
MARY: It's a new sigil?

4547
04:38:07,521 --> 04:38:11,832
LIAM: It's not a sigil, it's a geometric pattern
on the ground.

4548
04:38:11,832 --> 04:38:12,983
SAM: What if we--

4549
04:38:12,983 --> 04:38:14,463
TRAVIS: Just kill her.

4550
04:38:14,463 --> 04:38:17,819
SAM: (sighs) I throw dagger at Dren.

4551
04:38:17,819 --> 04:38:19,237
LIAM: Go. Attack.

4552
04:38:19,237 --> 04:38:21,593
TRAVIS: Who's now engaged.

4553
04:38:21,593 --> 04:38:22,703
SAM: 17?

4554
04:38:22,703 --> 04:38:29,859
LIAM: Yeah, hits. No, there's no sneak attack. The
only person near her is Devan. You guys are not

4555
04:38:29,859 --> 04:38:31,208
within five feet of her.

4556
04:38:31,208 --> 04:38:33,146
TRAVIS: I thought Delweth hit her with a rapier.

4557
04:38:33,146 --> 04:38:34,413
LIAM: She bounced back on that.

4558
04:38:34,413 --> 04:38:35,654
SAM: Seven points.

4559
04:38:35,654 --> 04:38:39,572
ASHLY: Hope that feels real good, Alby.

4560
04:38:39,572 --> 04:38:45,494
LIAM: Are you still standing? Dren's still
standing?

4561
04:38:45,494 --> 04:38:46,811
ASHLY: Dren's still standing.

4562
04:38:46,811 --> 04:38:48,320
LIAM: Dren, you're up.

4563
04:38:48,320 --> 04:38:56,846
ASHLY: I'm going to take this action to rip up the
ledger that I have.

4564
04:38:56,846 --> 04:38:59,247
LAURA: Oh! What's up, motherfucker?

4565
04:38:59,247 --> 04:39:10,036
ASHLY: I rip it into shreds, and I say a haiku,
which is this: Though I die today/At least with my

4566
04:39:10,036 --> 04:39:15,793
love I go/Fuck all you bastards!

4567
04:39:15,793 --> 04:39:22,059
MARY: B-A-S-S T-U-R-D-S. They are fish, they are
shit.

4568
04:39:22,059 --> 04:39:24,779
SAM: That was probably your finest haiku.

4569
04:39:24,779 --> 04:39:27,433
LIAM: May be your final act on earth. Tarvis,
you're up.

4570
04:39:27,433 --> 04:39:33,363
TRAVIS: Oh, that ledger. I'm going to kill Dren.

4571
04:39:33,363 --> 04:39:34,947
LIAM: Yes.

4572
04:39:34,947 --> 04:39:36,461
LAURA: One!

4573
04:39:36,461 --> 04:39:37,682
TRAVIS: No. 15.

4574
04:39:37,682 --> 04:39:38,800
LIAM: Yes.

4575
04:39:38,800 --> 04:39:46,589
TRAVIS: Six plus eight and-- yeah. 12.

4576
04:39:46,589 --> 04:39:48,017
LIAM: What are you using to do this?

4577
04:39:48,017 --> 04:39:49,770
TRAVIS: My whip.

4578
04:39:49,770 --> 04:39:52,987
SAM: Oh, shit.

4579
04:39:52,987 --> 04:39:54,498
LAURA: That's so shitty.

4580
04:39:54,498 --> 04:39:55,922
TRAVIS: 16.

4581
04:39:55,922 --> 04:39:58,112
ASHLY: I am extremely dead.

4582
04:39:58,112 --> 04:40:04,951
LIAM: The whip wraps around her neck and you yank
and pull, and she chokes out.

4583
04:40:04,951 --> 04:40:06,234
LAURA: Oh god.

4584
04:40:06,234 --> 04:40:12,154
TRAVIS: Would you guys mind if I finished that
off?

4585
04:40:12,154 --> 04:40:14,959
MARY: No. I have no problem with that.

4586
04:40:14,959 --> 04:40:18,478
TRAVIS: Okay. I take a dagger, and I know she's
unconscious.

4587
04:40:18,478 --> 04:40:21,117
LIAM: Yeah. We don't need an action for this, go
ahead.

4588
04:40:21,117 --> 04:40:24,902
TRAVIS: And I turn her head towards Devan and sink
it in the neck.

4589
04:40:24,902 --> 04:40:27,439
LAURA: He's terrible.

4590
04:40:27,439 --> 04:40:28,968
LIAM: She's dead.

4591
04:40:28,968 --> 04:40:39,103
TRAVIS: Betrayal's a bitch. I'm dead, you guys, I
really needed that ledger. Is it in shreds? Is it

4592
04:40:39,103 --> 04:40:44,026
tapeable? I mean, did she office mash that shit, or
is it--

4593
04:40:44,026 --> 04:40:46,953
ASHLY: It's shredded! It's the most shredded! I
came from the afterlife to shred!

4594
04:40:46,953 --> 04:40:51,929
LIAM: If you can find Percival de Rolo to invent
tape, then maybe you could tape it together. The

4595
04:40:51,929 --> 04:40:56,474
pieces are there. The names are there. I mean,
she's not a paper shredder.

4596
04:40:56,474 --> 04:41:02,319
TRAVIS: Okay, good. I put them in a satchel. Are
those sconces around the room? Four sconces?

4597
04:41:02,319 --> 04:41:06,410
LIAM: They're magical transparent globes.

4598
04:41:06,410 --> 04:41:09,079
TRAVIS: They're just orbs. Can we go back into the
room?

4599
04:41:09,079 --> 04:41:11,713
LIAM: In here? Sure. You're going in there?

4600
04:41:11,713 --> 04:41:14,437
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll go in there, because I'm
probably dead anyway. Can I pick up the baby

4601
04:41:14,437 --> 04:41:15,791
finger pipes?

4602
04:41:15,791 --> 04:41:16,978
LIAM: Yes.

4603
04:41:16,978 --> 04:41:19,485
TRAVIS: Can I try and play some music on that
shit?

4604
04:41:19,485 --> 04:41:20,591
LIAM: You can.

4605
04:41:20,591 --> 04:41:22,548
LAURA: I had the baby finger pipes on my body.

4606
04:41:22,548 --> 04:41:24,078
LIAM: They're not there.

4607
04:41:24,078 --> 04:41:30,001
TRAVIS: They're not there? Oh, then I go and
Dren-- oh, she doesn't have them. Oh, look,

4608
04:41:30,001 --> 04:41:34,821
they're on Devan's stupid dead body. Can I try and
play some music?

4609
04:41:34,821 --> 04:41:36,862
LIAM: (raspberry sound)

4610
04:41:36,862 --> 04:41:38,463
MARY: We're going to die in here.

4611
04:41:38,463 --> 04:41:40,002
TRAVIS: What else is in that room?

4612
04:41:40,002 --> 04:41:41,863
LIAM: You're going to do a perception check?

4613
04:41:41,863 --> 04:41:43,056
MARY: Yeah. All of us.

4614
04:41:43,056 --> 04:41:46,546
LIAM: You're all in there? There's room for two
people to go in. Who's in?

4615
04:41:46,546 --> 04:41:48,922
TRAVIS: I'm in there, and I rolled a 14 plus five.
19.

4616
04:41:48,922 --> 04:41:50,268
MARY: 21.

4617
04:41:50,268 --> 04:41:55,751
LIAM: Yeah, you both-- really, you were so
bedazzled by what you saw on the shelf. You didn't

4618
04:41:55,751 --> 04:42:00,260
really look around this little room. There are
three levers directly to the right of the door on

4619
04:42:00,260 --> 04:42:01,497
the wall.

4620
04:42:01,497 --> 04:42:12,181
MARY: Is there anything around these levers at
all? Anything? Any markings, any arcane

4621
04:42:12,181 --> 04:42:14,100
something?

4622
04:42:14,100 --> 04:42:15,426
LIAM: No, just three.

4623
04:42:15,426 --> 04:42:17,160
TRAVIS: Hey, there's three of us. Let's all grab
one.

4624
04:42:17,160 --> 04:42:19,036
LIAM: There's not room for the three of you.

4625
04:42:19,036 --> 04:42:20,407
SAM: You have two hands.

4626
04:42:20,407 --> 04:42:22,057
TRAVIS: How about I do the one that's furthest
into the room?

4627
04:42:22,057 --> 04:42:24,378
MARY: He's a little tiny guy, isn't he?

4628
04:42:24,378 --> 04:42:26,978
LIAM: Who's going?

4629
04:42:26,978 --> 04:42:29,563
SAM: You have multiple hands that you can use to
pull levers.

4630
04:42:29,563 --> 04:42:31,986
MARY: I've got a Mage Hand.

4631
04:42:31,986 --> 04:42:36,370
LAURA: Jesus, pull some fucking levers!

4632
04:42:36,370 --> 04:42:42,916
SAM: While this is going on, I'm cutting off
Devan's hand.

4633
04:42:42,916 --> 04:42:45,562
LIAM: All right. So three levers are getting
pulled--

4634
04:42:45,562 --> 04:42:48,299
MARY: But I'm stepping out of the room and casting
my Mage Hand.

4635
04:42:48,299 --> 04:42:50,154
TRAVIS: Just the one that's closest to the back of
the wall first.

4636
04:42:50,154 --> 04:42:51,553
LIAM: Tell me what's happening.

4637
04:42:51,553 --> 04:42:55,691
TRAVIS: I have my left hand on the one that's
furthest in the room. Right hand on the middle one.

4638
04:42:55,691 --> 04:42:58,556
LIAM: And you're in there. You're standing
outside.

4639
04:42:58,556 --> 04:43:01,254
MARY: And I use my Mage Hand to pull the other.

4640
04:43:01,254 --> 04:43:03,519
TRAVIS: But we're only doing one at a time.

4641
04:43:03,519 --> 04:43:04,693
MARY: All right.

4642
04:43:04,693 --> 04:43:11,689
LIAM: One at a time? All right. So you're outside,
waiting. You're inside. Okay. So you're pulling

4643
04:43:11,689 --> 04:43:12,530
first?

4644
04:43:12,530 --> 04:43:14,449
TRAVIS: Yeah. The deepest one in the room. Crank.

4645
04:43:14,449 --> 04:43:24,073
LIAM: Okay. Delweth and Obby immediately take 8d6
electric damage from the floor in the circular

4646
04:43:24,073 --> 04:43:25,204
room.

4647
04:43:25,204 --> 04:43:27,339
ASHLY: 8d6?

4648
04:43:27,339 --> 04:43:28,506
LIAM: Yes.

4649
04:43:28,506 --> 04:43:32,082
TRAVIS: Who rolls that?

4650
04:43:32,082 --> 04:43:34,107
LIAM: I'll do it.

4651
04:43:34,107 --> 04:43:41,130
ASHLY: (whispers) This was a suicide mission.

4652
04:43:41,130 --> 04:43:45,529
LAURA: Oh man, if I'd grabbed that lever when I
was in there grabbing that big jewel.

4653
04:43:45,529 --> 04:43:54,914
LIAM: Delweth and Obby take 31 points of damage.

4654
04:43:54,914 --> 04:43:57,942
SAM and MARY: Dead.

4655
04:43:57,942 --> 04:44:01,158
LIAM: Unconscious? Electrified, up in smoke.

4656
04:44:01,158 --> 04:44:03,405
TRAVIS: Are they unconscious or dead?

4657
04:44:03,405 --> 04:44:05,956
LIAM: They are smoking and on the ground.

4658
04:44:05,956 --> 04:44:08,180
TRAVIS: I only have one healing potion.

4659
04:44:08,180 --> 04:44:10,047
SAM: Oh, I have tons.

4660
04:44:10,047 --> 04:44:12,055
MARY: I do, too. Take them from my body.

4661
04:44:12,055 --> 04:44:22,320
TRAVIS: Okay. I run out and go, oh, jeez-- wait a
minute. Is the floor still electrified? I put the

4662
04:44:22,320 --> 04:44:31,278
lever back up. I run out, I pour one greater
healing potion into Obby's mouth. He wakes up and

4663
04:44:31,278 --> 04:44:34,742
I go, hi, I need a healing potion. I run over
and pour it into Delweth's mouth.

4664
04:44:34,742 --> 04:44:36,985
MARY: Because I have a superior.

4665
04:44:36,985 --> 04:44:41,793
TRAVIS: That didn't work so awesome. How about
I'll stand out here now, and one of you go in

4666
04:44:41,793 --> 04:44:43,304
there and pull the second one in case--

4667
04:44:43,304 --> 04:44:45,500
MARY: I've got to roll some-- what do we do to get
back to--

4668
04:44:45,500 --> 04:44:46,936
LIAM: (sizzling sound)

4669
04:44:46,936 --> 04:44:48,482
SAM: What was that?

4670
04:44:48,482 --> 04:44:58,859
LIAM: There is a little old woman standing in the
closet behind you. She raises a staff. "You

4671
04:44:58,859 --> 04:45:12,714
"fucking assholes." There is a transparent cage
around the three of you, now. She walks out,

4672
04:45:12,714 --> 04:45:16,990
click, clack, click.

4673
04:45:16,990 --> 04:45:19,623
LAURA: The Shrew.

4674
04:45:19,623 --> 04:45:25,197
LIAM: "Do you little shits really think the Clasp
is the only one that has little birds who whisper

4675
04:45:25,197 --> 04:45:38,975
"to them?" In that moment, she raises her hand, and
you hear her utter the word (arcane gibberish).

4676
04:45:38,975 --> 04:45:49,487
The air around you grows dry. You feel the
moisture in your bodies pull out. You remember

4677
04:45:49,487 --> 04:46:02,749
that scene at the end of the Last Crusade? With
the cup? All the moisture leaves your body, and

4678
04:46:02,749 --> 04:46:12,123
your skin gets dry and flakes away, and your sight
goes, and the world grows dark, and you guys fall,

4679
04:46:12,123 --> 04:46:24,956
three husks upon the ground. The cage shrinks,
shrinks, dragging your three bodies together. Five

4680
04:46:24,956 --> 04:46:42,188
bodies together. "You don't fuck the Shrew. The
Shrew screws you." And she moves her hand, and the

4681
04:46:42,188 --> 04:46:57,219
circle in the middle fans open, and five bodies
fall down through a tube and land in a pile of

4682
04:46:57,219 --> 04:47:10,366
mimic corpse. Click, click, click. "Fuck family."

4683
04:47:10,366 --> 04:47:13,728
(laughter)

4684
04:47:13,728 --> 04:47:17,944
(cheering)

4685
04:47:17,944 --> 04:47:23,028
SAM: A classic Liam uplifting ending.

4686
04:47:23,028 --> 04:47:25,026
(laughter)

4687
04:47:25,026 --> 04:47:26,256
LAURA: All that work.

4688
04:47:26,256 --> 04:47:27,738
MARY: Never got a chance to kill you.

4689
04:47:27,738 --> 04:47:29,284
LAURA: You were trying to kill him?

4690
04:47:29,284 --> 04:47:35,347
LIAM: Everybody tell the group the secret I gave
you. Starting with Obby. What's the secret I gave you?

4691
04:47:35,347 --> 04:47:37,588
SAM: That I love Tarvis?

4692
04:47:37,588 --> 04:47:38,924
LIAM: That's it, no secrets.

4693
04:47:38,924 --> 04:47:44,481
SAM: Not romantically. I'm indebted to you and I
would do anything for you.

4694
04:47:44,481 --> 04:47:46,553
LAURA: That's so sweet!

4695
04:47:46,553 --> 04:47:53,449
TRAVIS: I had to steal the ledger, which was the
real objective, and Devan knew too much to be left

4696
04:47:53,449 --> 04:47:55,878
alive. She had to die.

4697
04:47:55,878 --> 04:47:58,661
MARY: I knew that we were going to kill Devan at
the end of this.

4698
04:47:58,661 --> 04:47:59,792
SAM: I also knew that.

4699
04:47:59,792 --> 04:48:06,505
MARY: And I also knew that I was passed over for
you, so I was going to kill you, because I was

4700
04:48:06,505 --> 04:48:11,845
jealous of power. I know, you kept turning to me
going, "Are you a Lannister?" I'm like, fuck!

4701
04:48:11,845 --> 04:48:14,353
LIAM: Ashly, what was Dren's secret?

4702
04:48:14,353 --> 04:48:19,888
ASHLY: Oh, it was very well-kept, that I was in
love with Devan and I wanted to run away with her.

4703
04:48:19,888 --> 04:48:24,435
SAM: I think your first line of dialogue was, "I'm
in love with you secretly!"

4704
04:48:24,435 --> 04:48:27,046
(laughter)

4705
04:48:27,046 --> 04:48:30,582
TRAVIS: "I'm secretly in love with you!"

4706
04:48:30,582 --> 04:48:35,953
LIAM: And Devan, why don't you tell Dren what your
secret is?

4707
04:48:35,953 --> 04:48:37,979
LAURA: I was going to fucking betray you.

4708
04:48:37,979 --> 04:48:40,416
(yelling)

4709
04:48:40,416 --> 04:48:42,148
TRAVIS: You are not the father!

4710
04:48:42,148 --> 04:48:47,478
LAURA: But I didn't want to! He made me! I didn't
want to do it! I even asked him, I'm like, can I

4711
04:48:47,478 --> 04:48:49,176
choose not to betray her?

4712
04:48:49,176 --> 04:48:51,689
LIAM: I said no. You're all bad people.

4713
04:48:51,689 --> 04:48:55,831
ASHLY: I know. Dren's a little dummy, so she
would've gone for it.

4714
04:48:55,831 --> 04:48:57,277
TRAVIS: You could've lived, man.

4715
04:48:57,277 --> 04:48:59,902
ASHLY: Fuck no, I would've died, please.

4716
04:48:59,902 --> 04:49:01,523
LAURA: That was awesome.

4717
04:49:01,523 --> 04:49:05,012
LIAM: I wanted an evil campaign, I wanted to play
it, no one would make it for me, so I made it

4718
04:49:05,012 --> 04:49:06,002
myself.

4719
04:49:06,002 --> 04:49:07,734
(cheering)

4720
04:49:07,734 --> 04:49:09,064
LAURA: We're all assholes.

4721
04:49:09,064 --> 04:49:12,946
LIAM: Thanks, everybody, you guys, the five of
you, and thanks, everybody, for watching if you

4722
04:49:12,946 --> 04:49:16,127
hung in to the end. I know it was long. I don't
know how to balance anything or know how long

4723
04:49:16,127 --> 04:49:20,192
things take. I threw a bunch of spaghetti at the
wall. But it was fun.

4724
04:49:20,192 --> 04:49:22,666
LAURA: You done good, bro.

4725
04:49:22,666 --> 04:49:23,837
ASHLY: You done real good.

4726
04:49:23,837 --> 04:49:24,699
LIAM: Thank you.

4727
04:49:24,699 --> 04:49:25,693
TRAVIS: Thank you to Loot Crate!

4728
04:49:25,693 --> 04:49:27,074
(cheering)

4729
04:49:27,074 --> 04:49:28,710
LAURA: Oh boy, Harley Quinn!
