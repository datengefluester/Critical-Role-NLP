00:00:00,345 --> 00:00:04,736
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
pseudo-episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of

2
00:00:04,736 --> 00:00:10,297
us nerdy voice actors will be answering your
questions and then doing a fantastic battle royale

3
00:00:10,297 --> 00:00:13,926
showdown between Pike, Vax, Keyleth, and Percy.

4
00:00:13,926 --> 00:00:15,224
ASHLEY: Woo-hoo!

5
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:17,341
MATT: For those of you who were here for our last
battle royale, it's going to be a fun circumstance

6
00:00:17,341 --> 00:00:21,799
where the players are dropped into a scenario they
do not yet know. They'll be forced to battle with

7
00:00:21,799 --> 00:00:25,558
only one victor, the last man standing. But we'll
get into that for the second half of this evening.

8
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:31,406
First, let's get through some quick announcements.
If we want to get through those, I probably should

9
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:32,716
have loaded them up on my phone.

10
00:00:32,716 --> 00:00:35,901
MARISHA: Yeah, Let me see if I can beat you to
that.

11
00:00:35,901 --> 00:00:41,140
MATT: You want to get to that right now. But in
the meantime, this comes to our fourth and final

12
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:46,396
week of this run, being sponsored by Loot Crate,
who've been fantastic for this month run of

13
00:00:46,396 --> 00:00:50,196
Critical Role. It's our first time trying out a
sponsorship. You guys have been awesome in

14
00:00:50,196 --> 00:00:55,050
checking out their stuff, and I hope a lot of you
guys have enjoyed becoming part of the Loot Crate

15
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,589
membership family. We are!

16
00:00:57,589 --> 00:01:04,988
MARISHA: And you can get $3 off your subscription
with code 'criticalrole'.

17
00:01:04,988 --> 00:01:16,391
MATT: Yeah, at www.lootcrate.com/criticalrole. I
talk for a living. Anyway, what else do we want to

18
00:01:16,391 --> 00:01:17,695
announce this evening?

19
00:01:17,695 --> 00:01:25,046
MARISHA: Also, the Dear Vox Machina article series
has been going on on Friday nights. Wait, whose

20
00:01:25,046 --> 00:01:26,575
came out last?

21
00:01:26,575 --> 00:01:27,804
MATT: Grog, I thought it was.

22
00:01:27,804 --> 00:01:32,059
MARISHA: I think mine's coming out tomorrow. I
think Keyleth is tomorrow.

23
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:33,716
TALIESIN: I better get mine turned in.

24
00:01:33,716 --> 00:01:36,452
MARISHA: You should probably turn yours in. You
should probably do your work.

25
00:01:36,452 --> 00:01:38,358
MATT: I should probably turn mine in too.

26
00:01:38,358 --> 00:01:46,240
MARISHA: Jeez, fucking slackers. Galavanting in
Hawaii.

27
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,154
ASHLEY: Yeah, whatever, getting a tan.

28
00:01:49,154 --> 00:01:50,724
TALIESIN: Well, a burn.

29
00:01:50,724 --> 00:02:01,000
MATT: I do have to point out, strong appreciation
for Taliesin to really fly the true nerd banner by

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,003
having a trip to Hawaii and spending a portion of
it in his hotel room playing D&amp;D on Skype.

31
00:02:06,003 --> 00:02:11,370
TALIESIN: There was a beautiful sunset happening
right offscreen. My friends who I'm sharing

32
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:17,400
a room with were like-- "We're going snorkeling!"

33
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,048
LIAM: Got to kill a dragon.

34
00:02:21,048 --> 00:02:23,652
MATT: That's pretty great.

35
00:02:23,652 --> 00:02:26,944
MARISHA: And then your first episode of Signal
Boost went live on Tuesday.

36
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:31,538
TALIESIN: Yay! My first episode of Signal Boost
went-- oh, ow, that hurt-- live on Tuesday!

37
00:02:31,538 --> 00:02:32,858
MARISHA: Don't burn yourself!

38
00:02:32,858 --> 00:02:37,115
TALIESIN: I'm going to burn us down. This whole
game is coming down now. Yeah, you should check it

39
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:40,189
out. I'm really proud of it, and I'm happy with
it, and there's more fun.

40
00:02:40,189 --> 00:02:42,639
MARISHA: Good, I'm glad! I'm glad you're not totally
embarrassed.

41
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:45,484
TALIESIN: Mortified.

42
00:02:45,484 --> 00:02:52,654
MARISHA: It's very fun, the internet loves you.
It's uncanny.

43
00:02:52,654 --> 00:03:01,015
ASHLEY: I finally splurged on your episodes,
Marisha. I did. And I've liked all of the things

44
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:05,642
that you liked. Now I'm going to watch Hector's.

45
00:03:05,642 --> 00:03:09,349
LIAM: We should all like bees, really.

46
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:13,513
MARISHA: Bees are great. Bees or die.

47
00:03:13,513 --> 00:03:19,861
TALIESIN: Well, I will have a hive soon, it is
happening. It's being built right now.

48
00:03:19,861 --> 00:03:21,482
LIAM: Right next door to the chickens?

49
00:03:21,482 --> 00:03:25,769
TALIESIN: Technically, next door to my room, but
yeah, right next to the chickens. Screen window,

50
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:30,702
crucifix, it'll get the whole thing stopped.

51
00:03:30,702 --> 00:03:32,770
(laughter)

52
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,539
MATT: Love the bees at a distance!

53
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:37,711
MARISHA: Oh, they're very nice. They're sweet.

54
00:03:37,711 --> 00:03:40,581
MATT: What other announcements have we got?

55
00:03:40,581 --> 00:03:43,205
MARISHA: That's it. No one else added anything
else.

56
00:03:43,205 --> 00:03:50,070
MATT: I have a quick announcement. Those who
haven't seen or had an opportunity to play yet,

57
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:57,372
this week had the launch of Overwatch, Blizzard's
new game. I'm lucky enough to play the character

58
00:03:57,372 --> 00:04:04,278
McCree, the space cowboy. You guys get to have an
opportunity to shoot a six-shooter in the game and

59
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:08,290
tell people (McCree voice), "It's high noon." If
you haven't played it, you should, it's a lot of

60
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,019
fun. I have enjoyed the <i>crap</i> out of it.

61
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:11,441
MARISHA: It's so good.

62
00:04:11,441 --> 00:04:13,513
LIAM: You bring it on yourself just saying that
catchphrase.

63
00:04:13,513 --> 00:04:20,948
MATT: I get tweeted pretty much at every time
zone's noon. Every day, people barrage me with,

64
00:04:20,948 --> 00:04:22,561
"Hey Matt, what time is it?"

65
00:04:22,561 --> 00:04:29,552
MARISHA: Every time zone! Once an hour on the
hour! What time is it?

66
00:04:29,552 --> 00:04:31,652
TALIESIN: It's about four o'clock, why? Oh.

67
00:04:31,652 --> 00:04:41,501
MARISHA: And not to be confused with MacCready.

68
00:04:41,501 --> 00:04:47,398
MATT: No, apparently any gun-slinging guys with
McCree in their name have been me this past year.

69
00:04:47,398 --> 00:04:52,532
MARISHA: Yeah, you got the cornerstone. McCree,
MacCready, and then what is the name of your

70
00:04:52,532 --> 00:04:56,090
character in Evolve, which is also a cyber space
cowboy?

71
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:02,645
MATT: Space cowboy, that's Abe. (Abe voice)
Abraham Presley. Yeah, guys in hats with guns has

72
00:05:02,645 --> 00:05:07,796
been a theme this past year, some of them with
really great facial hair. I love that theme.

73
00:05:07,796 --> 00:05:10,764
TALIESIN: I'm really looking forward to Overwatch.
I haven't hit it yet.

74
00:05:10,764 --> 00:05:13,351
MARISHA: It's so good, you guys.

75
00:05:13,351 --> 00:05:15,352
MATT: We're going to have to sync up and play it.

76
00:05:15,352 --> 00:05:17,358
TALIESIN: It's going to be a thing.

77
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:26,940
MATT: Anyway! We've got questions to get to. So,
first and foremost, we have a few sources of

78
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,777
questions. Obviously we're not going to get to a
lot of them tonight, because there's a lot of

79
00:05:29,777 --> 00:05:34,413
questions. But there's a Reddit thread that's been
up for a little while, we're going to be pulling

80
00:05:34,413 --> 00:05:38,245
questions from there. The chat room as well, we
have at our side here. We have questions coming

81
00:05:38,245 --> 00:05:43,910
from you guys there as long as we can keep track
of it because it goes pretty fast. Is my mic bad,

82
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:51,608
not getting a good mic? I'll lean this way then
and try and get to this section. Should work fine.

83
00:05:51,608 --> 00:05:53,293
MARISHA: You could adjust the boom.

84
00:05:53,293 --> 00:05:57,432
MATT: Yeah, but the camera is there. Karen?

85
00:05:57,432 --> 00:06:00,148
KAREN: You're very audible. They're just being
picky.

86
00:06:00,148 --> 00:06:04,704
MATT: Just being picky? Guys, stop being picky.
It's all good. So long as you guys can hear me, I

87
00:06:04,704 --> 00:06:14,541
think we're okay. Yeah, we have Reddit, we have
the chat room, and then we have on Twitter the

88
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:18,947
hashtag Critical Role questions as well. We'll be
going through those and picking questions,

89
00:06:18,947 --> 00:06:25,051
answering them as they come. So, let us begin.
We're apologizing now for all of us looking at our

90
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,921
phones. It's not because we're bored, it's because
we want to answer your questions.

91
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:29,611
LIAM: That's where the questions are.

92
00:06:29,611 --> 00:06:32,553
MARISHA: Ermagerd, querstions!

93
00:06:32,553 --> 00:06:40,996
MATT: This comes from Groghammer on Reddit. "After
the episode 'Cows and Consequences', Matt said it

94
00:06:40,996 --> 00:06:45,642
"was one of the weirdest, but not the weirdest, D&amp;D
experience he's ever had. To him and others with

95
00:06:45,642 --> 00:06:50,095
"experience, what is the weirdest thing that's
happened in a game you've played?" This is an

96
00:06:50,095 --> 00:06:51,946
interesting question.

97
00:06:51,946 --> 00:06:55,644
MARISHA: Offscreen, I guess? Outside of 'Cows and
Consequences'?

98
00:06:55,644 --> 00:06:59,475
MATT: It could be something in Critical Role if
you want to, but if you had other stranger

99
00:06:59,475 --> 00:07:08,151
experiences. I'll begin. This was weird but dark.
This was when I was running the Ravenloft game for

100
00:07:08,151 --> 00:07:15,541
a few years with my old group back in the late
2000s. As they began to make their way through

101
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:22,123
Barovia, the atmosphere of it was drawing them
down and every night they'd sleep there, they

102
00:07:22,123 --> 00:07:25,762
would take corruption similarly to how you did
when you were in Whitestone under the watch of the

103
00:07:25,762 --> 00:07:37,903
Briarwoods. We had our bard begin to grow
sharpened teeth. We had our rogue character, who

104
00:07:37,903 --> 00:07:44,591
had a long-dormant mummy rot that had been
subsiding in his body begin to spread again. We

105
00:07:44,591 --> 00:07:48,096
had our blood mage, who had died and been
resurrected, came back not quite right and went a

106
00:07:48,096 --> 00:07:55,876
little feral. And then we had our paladin, whose
skin all of a sudden was pulled tighter against

107
00:07:55,876 --> 00:08:01,583
his body, and as a person whose whole ideal was to
fight undead, to look in the mirror one day and

108
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:06,395
see that he resembled one, he went crazy and
started smashing stuff. It was a cool buildup, but

109
00:08:06,395 --> 00:08:11,368
one of the weirder, fun experiences was when they
had finally finished the battle with Strahd, when

110
00:08:11,368 --> 00:08:20,495
they had defeated him and, in theory, saved
Ravenloft, the epilogue ended up being a "at what

111
00:08:20,495 --> 00:08:28,442
"cost?" circumstance. Well, the cleric died in the
final battle, the paladin killed himself, the

112
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:33,676
blood mage disappeared into the forest and was
never seen again. The rogue, who was like the

113
00:08:33,676 --> 00:08:38,865
older Indiana Jones character of the group, took
the castle for himself and became the new lord of

114
00:08:38,865 --> 00:08:43,567
Barovia, Batman-style, supposedly to watch over
the city, but his corruption had gotten so heavy

115
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:47,990
that it wasn't sure if they were replacing one
monster with another. And the bard, who had had a

116
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:52,381
constant feud with the rogue, got, in the final
moments of the game, in a huge argument

117
00:08:52,381 --> 00:08:57,650
post-battle, and the rogue grabbed him and tore
his tongue out. And the bard now served him as

118
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:03,492
this mute, subservient Gollum figure and was at
the edge of his throne in the epilogue as the

119
00:09:03,492 --> 00:09:05,690
rogue took the throne of Barovia for himself.

120
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,603
LIAM: It's like an Edward Gorey poem.

121
00:09:07,603 --> 00:09:11,097
MATT: Pretty much. It was a hell of an end to that
campaign.

122
00:09:11,097 --> 00:09:13,716
MARISHA: The bard went full-on Theon Greyjoy
style?

123
00:09:13,716 --> 00:09:16,887
MATT: Kind of, unintentionally. That was my friend
Shaun.

124
00:09:16,887 --> 00:09:19,577
TALIESIN: Oh, yes, of course. That makes perfect
sense.

125
00:09:19,577 --> 00:09:23,272
MATT: How about you guys?

126
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:28,820
TALIESIN: I got so enraptured in that story, I'm
trying to think--

127
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:32,546
MARISHA: Can mine be from Mansions of Madness? Can
mine be from board games?

128
00:09:32,546 --> 00:09:34,271
MATT: Sure, this is any game.

129
00:09:34,271 --> 00:09:38,501
MARISHA: I'm partial to the time where I was
playing as Ashcan Pete, who's my favorite

130
00:09:38,501 --> 00:09:47,250
character to play as in any Cthulhu universe. I
was down to one hit point, had lost my weapon, and

131
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:53,695
was hiding in a chest. And I popped out of a chest
and punched a shoggoth and killed him.

132
00:09:53,695 --> 00:10:00,866
MATT: Yeah, last hit point. It was the hobo
jack-in-the-boxing and punching a shoggoth.

133
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:07,341
MARISHA: The old hobo jack-in-the-box technique!
And it was great, and I'll never forget it.

134
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:10,283
TALIESIN: Ashcan Pete.

135
00:10:10,283 --> 00:10:12,254
MARISHA: Ashcan! Who can? Ashcan!

136
00:10:12,254 --> 00:10:15,643
TALIESIN: Thank you, that was all I hoped for.

137
00:10:15,643 --> 00:10:17,130
MATT: Any of you guys?

138
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:24,483
LIAM: My tabletop is high school, which I don't
remember too well. And then our home game, the

139
00:10:24,483 --> 00:10:30,050
show was far crazier than our home game was. As
fun as the home game was, nothing as lunatic as

140
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:31,538
the cow episode--

141
00:10:31,538 --> 00:10:37,780
ASHLEY: I wasn't a part of that cow episode, but I
remember watching it, and I was like, "This is

142
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:46,135
"ludicrous." I was laughing so hard, I had
projectile tears. I was like, "This is the

143
00:10:46,135 --> 00:10:49,560
"weirdest thing that's happened in this game."

144
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,844
MATT: It was pretty legitimate-- hopefully this
will work better for audio, thank you so much.

145
00:10:52,844 --> 00:10:59,814
TALIESIN: We did a Sabbat Vampire game tabletop
years ago at my friend Don's house that involved a

146
00:10:59,814 --> 00:11:03,817
savage burn on the Haunted Mansion and Pirates of
the Caribbean at Disneyland, and we were

147
00:11:03,817 --> 00:11:11,640
resurrected as vampires inside the Haunted
Mansion. And he had built an elaborate map of the

148
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,545
entire ride, it was really spectacular.

149
00:11:13,545 --> 00:11:15,208
(laughter)

150
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,342
TALIESIN: It's forever colored both of those
rides.

151
00:11:17,342 --> 00:11:22,802
MARISHA: I want to see, is there a Barovia travel
poster out there? Someone has to have made

152
00:11:22,802 --> 00:11:24,463
something like that, right?

153
00:11:24,463 --> 00:11:27,713
MATT: I hope so, like a pamphlet?

154
00:11:27,713 --> 00:11:30,148
MARISHA: Yeah. "Come visit sunny Barovia!"

155
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:34,644
MATT: "Not-quite-sunny Barovia!" If you do find
that on the internet, please send it to us or find

156
00:11:34,644 --> 00:11:40,294
us on Twitter, I'd love to see that. Question.
"Ashley, what classes would the cast of Blindspot

157
00:11:40,294 --> 00:11:45,115
"be in your opinion?" From Zodaru in the chatroom.

158
00:11:45,115 --> 00:12:00,357
ASHLEY: Probably Sully, who plays Kurt, the main
guy-- or no, we'll start with Jane Doe. I think

159
00:12:00,357 --> 00:12:11,937
she would be a fighter, straight-up fighter class.
I think Kurt Weller, Sully, would be a barbarian.

160
00:12:11,937 --> 00:12:22,883
I think Zapata would be a rogue. I would probably
be a bard or probably still a cleric.

161
00:12:22,883 --> 00:12:25,895
MATT: Yeah? You said so on the show.

162
00:12:25,895 --> 00:12:28,776
ASHLEY: Yeah, so I am.

163
00:12:28,776 --> 00:12:33,354
MATT: That was my favorite in-joke I've ever seen
in television from a nerd point ever. Those who

164
00:12:33,354 --> 00:12:38,060
haven't seen it, there's an episode of Blindspot
where Ashley's character gets teased about playing

165
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,915
your wizard and elf game. And you correct them
with--

166
00:12:40,915 --> 00:12:42,865
ASHLEY: It's called Dungeons and Dragons.

167
00:12:42,865 --> 00:12:47,528
MATT: I'm actually a gnome cleric. And I was like,
"Yes!"

168
00:12:47,528 --> 00:12:50,957
ASHLEY: Put it in where we can. Just stick it
right in.

169
00:12:50,957 --> 00:12:53,763
LIAM: It's called outreach.

170
00:12:53,763 --> 00:12:56,376
(laughter)

171
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:57,671
MATT: It is a way to put it.

172
00:12:57,671 --> 00:12:59,106
ASHLEY: Outreach, our outreach campaign.

173
00:12:59,106 --> 00:13:03,076
MATT: Liam, did you find a question you wanted to
tackle?

174
00:13:03,076 --> 00:13:05,100
LIAM: Um.

175
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,748
ASHLEY: I know, they're coming in fast. Coming in
hot!

176
00:13:08,748 --> 00:13:13,269
MATT: Here, I'll throw one in while you guys are
looking. Question for the players, "A few of you

177
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:18,737
"have come close to trading blows before." This is
from StoryBeforeNumbers on the Reddit page.

178
00:13:18,737 --> 00:13:23,192
"Within the actual narrative of Critical Role, do
you believe your character could ever be capable

179
00:13:23,192 --> 00:13:27,360
"of seriously fighting or killing another party
member, and if so, what would it take to reach

180
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,513
"that point?"

181
00:13:28,513 --> 00:13:36,783
LIAM: I think it would take a lot, and I got a lot
of static after Vax punched Percy. A week later,

182
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:42,761
everyone's like, "Like Vax has any horse to stand
on, with what happened with his sister." First of all,

183
00:13:42,761 --> 00:13:47,225
that was what was running through my head as I
punched Percy. None of you had to tell me about

184
00:13:47,225 --> 00:13:51,349
that, that's what I was thinking about. And if
that hadn't happened, I probably would have done

185
00:13:51,349 --> 00:13:57,823
more than punch him one time. I probably would
have went a little bit further. But I would say, on

186
00:13:57,823 --> 00:14:03,112
one hand, Vax thinks it's a little different
because Vax rushed in to try to save his sister,

187
00:14:03,112 --> 00:14:08,282
not exactly the same situation. But on the other
hand, you're kind of right, he doesn't have any moral high

188
00:14:08,282 --> 00:14:13,842
ground, and I'm not trying to play anyone on moral
high ground. And I thought, do I have the right to

189
00:14:13,842 --> 00:14:18,332
do this? Probably not, who cares? We're all
playing imperfect people.

190
00:14:18,332 --> 00:14:23,344
TALIESIN: Percy would absolutely kill another
member of Vox Machina if he thought that it was

191
00:14:23,344 --> 00:14:30,694
for the good of the whole group. He thought if
there was a situation where it was like, put one

192
00:14:30,694 --> 00:14:36,408
down because they were a threat to everybody else,
he'd probably be okay. Probably.

193
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:43,465
MARISHA: Yeah, Keyleth has a hard time killing the
scum of the earth. So no.

194
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:48,066
TALIESIN: I couldn't kill Trinket. I think I'd
feel really bad. I couldn't live with myself.

195
00:14:48,066 --> 00:14:50,020
LIAM: You're going to get diCaprio'd.

196
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:53,941
(laughter, bear grunting)

197
00:14:53,941 --> 00:15:00,126
ASHLEY: I don't know if Pike could do it. Even if
they were really bad or something was terrible, I

198
00:15:00,126 --> 00:15:05,790
feel like Pike would try anything to not kill one
of the members.

199
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:09,022
LIAM: You should stay in that mindset after the
break.

200
00:15:09,022 --> 00:15:13,549
ASHLEY: No, I will not! Tonight is an exception,
my friend!

201
00:15:13,549 --> 00:15:18,404
MATT: Well, Sarenrae, part of her sphere of
influence is redemption, too. With Pike, I could

202
00:15:18,404 --> 00:15:21,408
see her, definitely. She feels that even
somebody's who's fallen that far from what she

203
00:15:21,408 --> 00:15:23,910
knew, she could find a way to bring them back.

204
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:27,881
ASHLEY: Yeah, there's still something in them that
should still be there. I don't think there's

205
00:15:27,881 --> 00:15:31,781
anything that can make her kill somebody. Except
tonight.

206
00:15:31,781 --> 00:15:33,483
MATT: Except tonight. There you go, we'll have
it.

207
00:15:33,483 --> 00:15:35,096
TALIESIN: Tonight's special.

208
00:15:35,096 --> 00:15:36,863
MATT: Anyone find any questions they prefer
for this one?

209
00:15:36,863 --> 00:15:45,184
MARISHA: I have a good one. This is from
@CaraKiriyama on Twitter, "If the characters

210
00:15:45,234 --> 00:15:49,902
"hadn't found each other and formed Vox Machina,
what do you think they'd be doing instead?"

211
00:15:49,902 --> 00:15:52,996
TALIESIN: Percy'd be dead by now.

212
00:15:52,996 --> 00:15:56,340
MARISHA: Keyleth might be dead.

213
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:59,759
TALIESIN: He would have walked into something
stupid and that would have been the end of it.

214
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,103
LIAM: I think the twins would have been doing
mercenary work somewhere.

215
00:16:03,103 --> 00:16:13,519
MARISHA: Keyleth would try and continue on her
Aramente, by herself if she had to, maybe find

216
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:21,247
other people to pal around with along the way. She
tagged along with you guys because she was afraid

217
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:24,559
that she'd die out there alone, which, once again,
probably would've.

218
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:30,406
ASHLEY: I feel like Pike would've probably stayed,
hanging out in the Bramblewood, living with

219
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:39,763
Wilhand. I feel like she's pretty small-town, I
think this is such a huge adventure for Pike, and

220
00:16:39,763 --> 00:16:48,020
the only thing that brought Pike out of it was
because of Grog, was a family, and being like,

221
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:56,873
"Well, I guess I'll leave, try to help him and
find him." I don't think she would've explored

222
00:16:56,873 --> 00:17:01,817
that much, she would've stayed. So Vox Machina
brought out the best!

223
00:17:01,817 --> 00:17:05,661
MARISHA and TALIESIN: (singing) Just a small town
girl, living in a lonely world!

224
00:17:05,661 --> 00:17:07,934
(laughter)

225
00:17:07,934 --> 00:17:09,134
MATT: That is now your theme song.

226
00:17:09,134 --> 00:17:11,100
ASHLEY: Yes, such a good theme song!

227
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:22,691
MATT: I'll answer this quick question.
@Mandalore_Cauldley on Twitter asks, "What has

228
00:17:22,691 --> 00:17:28,401
"been the worst or best, if funniest, way there has
been a TPK in any game you've played?" For those

229
00:17:28,401 --> 00:17:33,044
of us who've had that happen before, it was the
Paranoia game that we played on here was pretty

230
00:17:33,044 --> 00:17:38,487
fun. There was definitely a universal TPK, as in
we accidentally wiped out all of existence and

231
00:17:38,487 --> 00:17:43,216
reality, so that was fun. I wasn't actually part
of this game, but I loved the story behind it.

232
00:17:43,216 --> 00:17:47,918
This was an evil campaign that-- same guy who was
the rogue in my Ravenloft game, Shaun-- and a few

233
00:17:47,918 --> 00:17:52,895
other people were playing. This was 3.0 D&amp;D, and
they were an evil campaign, they were all evil

234
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:58,680
characters. This was in Ravenloft, the Swords &amp;
Sorcery setting, not the Expedition to Ravenloft,

235
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:07,266
the whole plane of Ravenloft. And his evil cleric
had set up, for half the game, a plot to

236
00:18:07,266 --> 00:18:11,528
eventually to kill the rest of the party and take
them for power, but only the DM knew. And

237
00:18:11,528 --> 00:18:14,691
eventually he found the right moment, right
towards the end of their story arc, and they were

238
00:18:14,691 --> 00:18:19,584
on the cusp of finally completing their adventure.
And he told the DM, "This is the moment." And he

239
00:18:19,584 --> 00:18:24,572
systematically killed each member of the party,
took their heads, preserved their heads, still

240
00:18:24,572 --> 00:18:29,804
living, and put them on the shelf in his now-dark
tower. And that was the end of the campaign, he

241
00:18:29,804 --> 00:18:32,843
ended up TPKing the rest of his own party and putting
them on the shelf.

242
00:18:32,843 --> 00:18:36,165
TALIESIN: Bless Shaun.

243
00:18:36,165 --> 00:18:40,782
MATT: Shaun's an interesting character. Actually,
I think I'm seeing him this weekend at MomoCon in

244
00:18:40,782 --> 00:18:43,134
Atlanta. See you in a few days, Shawn!

245
00:18:43,134 --> 00:18:44,949
(laughter)

246
00:18:44,949 --> 00:18:48,860
ASHLEY: I feel like it would be so fun to be an
evil character.

247
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:53,056
LIAM: I want to do a one-off sometime that goes
further than the goblin game.

248
00:18:53,056 --> 00:18:57,479
MATT: That can be arranged. Next time we have a
day off like this and people can't make it,

249
00:18:57,479 --> 00:18:59,836
whoever's around, we'll do an evil one-shot.

250
00:18:59,836 --> 00:19:01,669
MARISHA: You started salivating almost.

251
00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:04,279
(laughter)

252
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:06,471
ASHLEY: (evil voice) We should do an evil
one-shot.

253
00:19:06,471 --> 00:19:08,578
LIAM: I know what that character is for that
game.

254
00:19:08,578 --> 00:19:13,195
MATT: That makes me happy. Chat room, let's see.

255
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:21,522
MARISHA: @LChow on Twitter says, "Who comes up
with and assigns the episode titles?" I think this

256
00:19:21,522 --> 00:19:25,855
is a funny story. Mainly, they come out
organically.

257
00:19:25,855 --> 00:19:31,156
MATT: Yeah, I have my own titles when I give the
adventure preparation for each session in the

258
00:19:31,156 --> 00:19:36,047
actual documents in my folder. But then when the
episodes happen, that very much informs what the

259
00:19:36,047 --> 00:19:38,010
episode titles are. Usually, it's--

260
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,470
MARISHA: Like "At Dawn, We Plan."

261
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,646
ASHLEY: That was so, I was like, "This has got to
be it."

262
00:19:42,646 --> 00:19:47,538
MARISHA: We all walk out and go like, "Well,
that's the title."

263
00:19:47,538 --> 00:19:55,283
MATT: The titles come out the next Monday morning,
Taliesin texting or emailing me at 11:30 AM.

264
00:19:55,283 --> 00:19:58,783
TALIESIN: Okay, we need a title now, you've got 20
minutes. Good morning, what's up?

265
00:19:58,783 --> 00:20:04,261
MATT: And I'll be in the middle of a session like,
"Okay, bathroom break? Okay. Ooh, that'll be

266
00:20:04,261 --> 00:20:05,738
"good." And that's all it is.

267
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:11,175
ASHLEY: I actually didn't know that. I didn't know
that you thought of the titles. Because they're fantastic.

268
00:20:11,175 --> 00:20:12,706
LIAM: Well, you got the bird's-eye view, Matt.

269
00:20:12,706 --> 00:20:15,588
MATT: That's the thing, I'd feel a little weird if
somebody I didn't know did the titles. Like the

270
00:20:15,588 --> 00:20:21,552
last episode that came out, somebody was like,
"The Dragon Episode," I'd be like, "Hmm." I'm not

271
00:20:21,552 --> 00:20:24,357
saying that would be the case, whoever would
possibly do the titles here at Geek &amp; Sundry, but

272
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:25,873
I'm a little attached.

273
00:20:25,873 --> 00:20:29,453
ASHLEY: It makes sense, I don't know who else I
thought would've done it besides you.

274
00:20:29,453 --> 00:20:31,209
MATT: We can do a vote.

275
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:33,184
TALIESIN: Draw lots.

276
00:20:33,184 --> 00:20:35,133
MARISHA: We do most everything ourselves.

277
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:41,456
LIAM: I got one. People all week-- all year,
really-- but a lot this week, have been asking

278
00:20:41,456 --> 00:20:46,473
me-- and telling me-- asking me does Vax have a
death wish or saying that Vax has a death wish.

279
00:20:46,473 --> 00:20:51,496
You are free to think I have a death wish. I don't
have a death wish, I don't want to roll a new

280
00:20:51,496 --> 00:20:55,995
character, I love my character, but I'm not going
to play him like an accountant. I'm going to rush

281
00:20:55,995 --> 00:21:01,247
in and try to save people and kill the
motherfuckers who killed my parents, my mother, I

282
00:21:01,247 --> 00:21:02,486
don't have a father.

283
00:21:02,486 --> 00:21:03,842
MATT: You do have a father.

284
00:21:03,842 --> 00:21:05,536
(laughter)

285
00:21:05,536 --> 00:21:09,290
LIAM: We'll get to that. I don't have a death
wish, I do not want to stop playing my character.

286
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:13,050
He could die next week, and I'll be bummed for a
while, but this is how I'm going to play him.

287
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:16,792
ASHLEY: Would you cry? I would cry.

288
00:21:16,792 --> 00:21:18,259
MARISHA: I would cry so much.

289
00:21:18,259 --> 00:21:20,697
MATT: We cried so hard when you died that one
time.

290
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:22,639
ASHLEY: That was horrible.

291
00:21:22,639 --> 00:21:29,162
LIAM: If I survive next week's game, I will do
something just as dumbfuck two to five episodes

292
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:32,213
later, so strap in. That's what I'm doing.

293
00:21:32,213 --> 00:21:35,934
MARISHA: It's not like we have a plan. I think
people assume we have plans.

294
00:21:35,934 --> 00:21:41,258
MATT: Well, first off, no plan survives contact
with the enemy, this is the general term. And

295
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:45,881
also, that's what D&amp;D is about. There have been
many games that I've played where I could do the

296
00:21:45,881 --> 00:21:51,704
smart, safe move, but then I stop myself and go,
"Why?" To me, I'd rather try something spectacular

297
00:21:51,704 --> 00:21:57,182
and fail spectacularly than keep it safe and on
its own. And even if a character could possibly

298
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:59,081
die, those are the moments that you remember.

299
00:21:59,081 --> 00:22:00,825
ASHLEY: It's true.

300
00:22:00,825 --> 00:22:03,238
TALIESIN: What's the video game from Rick and
Morty? I'm trying to remember.

301
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:06,008
MATT: Oh, the one where he goes and lives the
life?

302
00:22:06,008 --> 00:22:09,285
TALIESIN: You're taking him off the grid, he
doesn't have his Social Security card!

303
00:22:09,285 --> 00:22:13,128
(laughter)

304
00:22:13,128 --> 00:22:16,119
LIAM: The game can be different things for
different people, and if people want to treat it like

305
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:20,531
a WoW raid, go for it, have fun with that. But if
I had to be like, "Okay, how I can max out my

306
00:22:20,531 --> 00:22:27,455
"opportunities here and my chance to get my
Devout--," that's not why I play. I play to stick

307
00:22:27,455 --> 00:22:32,379
myself in epic books that I loved reading as a
kid. And sometimes characters die.

308
00:22:32,379 --> 00:22:34,580
TALIESIN: Many of those people in those books
die.

309
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:40,042
ASHLEY: I feel like we've all become the
characters so much.

310
00:22:40,042 --> 00:22:46,241
LIAM: Yeah. Someone else asked how long did it
take to create your characters, and I feel like

311
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:50,740
it's still happening. The first game was like,
"Yeah, I'm a rogue! We're twins? Cool! Okay, what

312
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:55,115
"do I do? I sneak around, Grog doesn't even know
that he can do whatever the hell he wants, great."

313
00:22:55,115 --> 00:22:57,431
It's so loosey-goosey.

314
00:22:57,431 --> 00:23:01,560
MARISHA: It's such an Urban Outfitter
inspirational poster: "Our stories are never over."

315
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,919
(laughter)

316
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:13,024
LIAM: It's still ripening. And sometimes we have
one-on-one conversations with each other or in a

317
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:17,529
group, we feel like we're learning new things
about the character-- every game-- or each other,

318
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:19,350
or ourselves even, playing this game.

319
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:27,523
TALIESIN: I feel knee-deep in act two right now.
Yeah, he's totally act two.

320
00:23:27,523 --> 00:23:35,872
MATT: You two especially have had some interesting
changes. You changed from pre-stream to stream

321
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:41,042
because of your whole experience on the ship, and
after death, Pike has become a lot more hardened

322
00:23:41,042 --> 00:23:46,060
and accepting of the harshness of reality, and
that's been cool to watch that happen.

323
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:52,733
ASHLEY: It's been fun. I almost still feel like
Pike is a little bit of act one. Even with

324
00:23:52,733 --> 00:23:56,508
everything that's happening, I'm still a little
like, "Ooh, there's more there."

325
00:23:56,508 --> 00:23:58,156
TALIESIN: Waiting for that big break to happen.

326
00:23:58,156 --> 00:24:05,175
ASHLEY: Yeah, but it's getting there. Someone
asked what led to Ashley and Travis deciding to

327
00:24:05,175 --> 00:24:10,470
link their backstories together? That was actually
not my decision.

328
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,646
LIAM: That was how you hooked her in.

329
00:24:12,646 --> 00:24:17,255
ASHLEY: That was how he put it together, which I
thought was really cool because I came to the

330
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:18,840
second game that you guys played?

331
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:24,039
MATT: Yeah, it was the second game. Travis
couldn't be there for the second game, so I worked

332
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:31,420
it into the story-- I didn't give you exactly what
it was, but I said, "If you want to tie it into

333
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:35,318
"why Travis can't be there with his character, how
would you want to work these together?"

334
00:24:35,318 --> 00:24:43,914
ASHLEY: Which is so crazy because how our
friendship in-game has turned out is so huge in

335
00:24:43,914 --> 00:24:48,755
the game for me. Which I wonder if that wasn't the
story, how different that would have been. But

336
00:24:48,755 --> 00:24:52,729
that's such a huge part of the story for me. So
crazy.

337
00:24:52,729 --> 00:24:55,788
MATT: It evolves in a really strange way.

338
00:24:55,788 --> 00:25:06,473
LIAM: Vax has a-- wishing he could follow a bit in
her footsteps, or did, and I don't want to get too

339
00:25:06,473 --> 00:25:11,844
much into that, and obviously all this. I didn't
have any beef with you at any time in the past,

340
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:13,835
but now I don't trust you as far as I can throw
you.

341
00:25:13,835 --> 00:25:16,425
TALIESIN: Good, that's a really good decision.

342
00:25:16,425 --> 00:25:23,126
LIAM: Grog and Vax never had any real digging at
each other, but it's a little dicier now. They're

343
00:25:23,126 --> 00:25:24,980
okay, but a little bit of--

344
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:29,535
MARISHA: One of these days, me and you, our ideals
are going to come to a crashing head.

345
00:25:29,535 --> 00:25:38,748
TALIESIN: Oh, it's going to be a crashing head.
I'm curious. There's so many things that are on

346
00:25:38,748 --> 00:25:40,328
the cusp of happening.

347
00:25:40,328 --> 00:25:45,025
ASHLEY: There's a lot of things. Because I haven't
even gotten to deal with this motherfuck yet about

348
00:25:45,025 --> 00:25:47,064
what's been going on with him.

349
00:25:47,064 --> 00:25:49,364
MARISHA: Oh, yeah, yeah.

350
00:25:49,364 --> 00:25:51,574
LIAM: I'm a cutter, I've been cutting.

351
00:25:51,574 --> 00:25:54,300
MATT: Dagger dagger dagger.

352
00:25:54,300 --> 00:26:01,299
ASHLEY: Him being Vax, not Liam.

353
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:02,855
LIAM: I'm Vex.

354
00:26:02,855 --> 00:26:05,659
MATT, MARISHA, TALIESIN: Don't.

355
00:26:05,659 --> 00:26:08,611
MATT: Don't fuck with her. You're right.

356
00:26:08,611 --> 00:26:10,789
LIAM: How long have we been playing this game
for?

357
00:26:10,789 --> 00:26:14,586
ASHLEY: But still, the split-second where I was
like, shit, I got it wrong. No, I didn't!

358
00:26:14,586 --> 00:26:21,156
MATT: That's your own fault, by the way. One
letter off, you dicks. Real fast, I want to put

359
00:26:21,156 --> 00:26:25,425
this out there, because this question has come up
a lot this week. Yes, I'm well aware that

360
00:26:25,425 --> 00:26:30,477
Dimension Door, from a rules standpoint, says that
if you are to teleport to a space occupied by a

361
00:26:30,477 --> 00:26:35,377
creature, it would shunt you out and take 4d6
psychic damage, I think. I agree with that.

362
00:26:35,377 --> 00:26:39,307
However, the players came up with a very
interesting plan, formed two of the smallest

363
00:26:39,307 --> 00:26:44,714
possible members into a creature that is so large
that I considered in that moment that there would

364
00:26:44,714 --> 00:26:48,909
be enough space where you wouldn't be occupying
technically the same space as the creature. So I

365
00:26:48,909 --> 00:26:52,232
allowed it for that circumstance. Most of the
time, yes, they would be shunted out, and if you'd

366
00:26:52,232 --> 00:26:57,423
rolled a lower intelligence roll, you probably
would have been pushed out the side. But as a

367
00:26:57,423 --> 00:27:00,978
Dungeon Master, you have to justify things,
consider what makes sense versus what doesn't, how

368
00:27:00,978 --> 00:27:05,713
much do the mechanics written in the rules rule
your game in the narrative, and how much you want

369
00:27:05,713 --> 00:27:10,163
to allow because the players have been creative or
it's an interesting way that could make sense and

370
00:27:10,163 --> 00:27:14,682
you can justify. I chose in that moment to justify
that, and it didn't necessarily work in their

371
00:27:14,682 --> 00:27:19,156
favor in some ways, but that's the nature of
making weird, cool plans and seeing if they come

372
00:27:19,156 --> 00:27:20,378
to fruition or not.

373
00:27:20,378 --> 00:27:21,826
LIAM: Still a fun game.

374
00:27:21,826 --> 00:27:25,276
MATT: So I'm well aware, and yes, I did let it.
That doesn't mean you have to. You can be angry

375
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:28,526
that I didn't follow the rules. I thought it was
fun and cool.

376
00:27:28,526 --> 00:27:31,742
LIAM: Sure you did. There's a rule in the rulebook
that says bend the rules whenever you want to bend

377
00:27:31,742 --> 00:27:34,319
the rules. That's a rule. So Matt followed the
rules.

378
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:39,804
ASHLEY: This is actually a cool question. This is
for Matt, and I would like to know this. Has there

379
00:27:39,804 --> 00:27:45,814
been something in-game that's happened that has
absolutely shocked you? Where you were like, this

380
00:27:45,814 --> 00:27:49,477
is something that's never happened in a game I've
DMed.

381
00:27:49,477 --> 00:27:57,037
MATT: Teleporting inside a dragon is definitely
new. The Cows and Consequences episode in general

382
00:27:57,037 --> 00:28:05,119
was ridiculous. There have been a few
moments. Well, first off, everyone going for the

383
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:10,947
treasure at the end of a boss encounter without
healing up or checking for traps, and that trap

384
00:28:10,947 --> 00:28:16,426
that I had set up there just as a possible blockade
being enough to knock Vex out based on the bad

385
00:28:16,426 --> 00:28:24,381
roll. I've never had a player death that was
directly after the conflict and danger. You know

386
00:28:24,381 --> 00:28:28,022
what I mean? Where the calm, everything's cool.
(explosion) It was, from a narrative standpoint,

387
00:28:28,022 --> 00:28:31,515
really cool how it played out, but I wasn't
expecting that to happen at all. It was going to

388
00:28:31,515 --> 00:28:36,625
be one other annoyance and warning of the power
behind this artifact, and it just happened that way.

389
00:28:36,625 --> 00:28:38,526
ASHLEY: That was the worst.

390
00:28:38,526 --> 00:28:43,508
MARISHA: We all felt like such assholes about
that. We were all like, wow, that was dumb.

391
00:28:43,508 --> 00:28:49,404
LIAM: Personally one of my most insane moments,
because I've always told myself, all right, the

392
00:28:49,404 --> 00:28:52,712
twins, Vax is going to give himself up for his
sister whenever he does it. And in that

393
00:28:52,712 --> 00:28:55,949
split-second I was like, here it is, here we go.
I'm going to end my game, I'm ending it, Laura's

394
00:28:55,949 --> 00:29:00,546
going to go on, I'm out. Just like I planned. And
you went-- flipped it on me.

395
00:29:00,546 --> 00:29:01,981
MATT: That's what I do.

396
00:29:01,981 --> 00:29:04,784
LIAM: All my ideas for the future went (pfft).

397
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,525
MATT: Good.

398
00:29:06,525 --> 00:29:08,866
LIAM: Had to change everything I was thinking.

399
00:29:08,866 --> 00:29:14,582
MATT: No, that was pretty cool. Other moment, I
would say honestly the showdown with Kevdak. I

400
00:29:14,582 --> 00:29:17,633
wasn't sure if you guys were going to survive
that, or at least a few of you were going to fall.

401
00:29:17,633 --> 00:29:24,067
A couple of key rolls in that fight. The Grog
escape, the broom escape, using the necklace in a

402
00:29:24,067 --> 00:29:29,094
way that I never considered it to be used. That
was-- the way you guys planned that battle worked

403
00:29:29,094 --> 00:29:35,409
out almost perfectly to just barely save your asses,
because that fight was one of the harder

404
00:29:35,409 --> 00:29:39,583
encounters I'd ever developed, and it was more
like I wasn't sure how it was going to go down. I

405
00:29:39,583 --> 00:29:44,545
had three other maps on the side in case you guys
had a sewer journey, if you guys wanted to stealth

406
00:29:44,545 --> 00:29:49,051
in during the night and assassinate Kevdak in his
room attempt, or find a way to try and--

407
00:29:49,051 --> 00:29:50,672
MARISHA: That would've been a good idea.

408
00:29:50,672 --> 00:29:54,705
TALIESIN: Wow, fuck, why didn't we think of that?

409
00:29:54,705 --> 00:30:01,386
MATT: There were different ways this could have
worked. The way this all went down, I left it open

410
00:30:01,386 --> 00:30:05,881
to see what you guys were going to do, and this
was possibly the hardest way to handle it, but it

411
00:30:05,881 --> 00:30:09,818
also ended up being one of the most dynamic and
cinematic, so I was excited how it worked out.

412
00:30:09,818 --> 00:30:13,134
LIAM: It was such a back-and-forth, too, because
we were like, okay, here's what we're going to try

413
00:30:13,134 --> 00:30:17,575
to do, shit, it's working, it's working, we got
this, we got this! And then it went (explosion)

414
00:30:17,575 --> 00:30:23,365
and flipped into 180, and we're like, we're dead,
we're dead, and then a Hail Mary pass at the last

415
00:30:23,365 --> 00:30:26,949
second. Ripping expectations back and forth.

416
00:30:26,949 --> 00:30:32,687
MATT: If anybody had got the death blow aside from
Grog, they wouldn't have stopped. That was the sad

417
00:30:32,752 --> 00:30:39,562
and scary part. Because it's one thing having an
old member of the herd that challenged him dealing

418
00:30:39,562 --> 00:30:45,529
the death blow to give them pause and really
consider, has this power move shifted, is he the

419
00:30:45,529 --> 00:30:49,698
new leader? That was enough to cause everyone to
stop and really consider the situation, and with

420
00:30:49,698 --> 00:30:55,473
Zanror being brought forth and released, it put
them into this tense period of-- not subservience

421
00:30:55,473 --> 00:31:02,075
or respecting or accepting the new rule, but not
really knowing what to do because their leader was

422
00:31:02,075 --> 00:31:06,673
gone, and the one who challenged and killed him in
a spectacular death, and it gave them pause. If it

423
00:31:06,673 --> 00:31:09,699
was a shitty half-elf that ran up and stabbed
their ruler--

424
00:31:09,699 --> 00:31:10,999
MARISHA: Hey.

425
00:31:10,999 --> 00:31:15,038
MATT: From their perspective, you guys were shitty
half-elves, all right? And a shitty gnome, and a

426
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:16,216
shitty human.

427
00:31:16,216 --> 00:31:19,826
ASHLEY: Hey! Rude.

428
00:31:19,826 --> 00:31:25,150
MATT: It would've continued in their mind to be an
aggressive act, and they would've continued to

429
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:30,767
steamroll you. That was so crazy. Anyway, yeah, we
should answer another question.

430
00:31:30,767 --> 00:31:34,668
MARISHA: Similar kinds of things happened with the
dragon, though, where it was like, this is going

431
00:31:34,668 --> 00:31:37,817
well, this is going pretty well-- oh, shit.

432
00:31:37,817 --> 00:31:40,225
ASHLEY: It's going not well at all. This is very not
good.

433
00:31:40,225 --> 00:31:47,906
MARISHA: Once again, internet, I think--
everyone's like, well, pretty much everything that

434
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,912
could've went wrong did. That pretty much--

435
00:31:49,912 --> 00:31:52,918
TALIESIN: That's so not true. So many things that
could've gone wrong didn't.

436
00:31:52,918 --> 00:31:55,389
MARISHA: We did pretty well, considering.

437
00:31:55,389 --> 00:31:59,224
LIAM: I'm a ground fighter. If I'd been on the
ground, I'd probably be goo in shoes.

438
00:31:59,224 --> 00:32:06,553
MATT: If you guys had not managed to-- the whole
mechanic I'd used was if the trap succeeded, based

439
00:32:06,553 --> 00:32:09,613
on the dragon's perception roll and how well you
guys hid things-- had the dragon even noticed

440
00:32:09,613 --> 00:32:12,358
there was something different and wrong, it
wouldn't have landed. It would've stayed up there

441
00:32:12,358 --> 00:32:17,465
and started spraying you guys down. Maybe throwing
spells. It would've been bad.

442
00:32:17,465 --> 00:32:19,404
ASHLEY: We did pretty well, considering.

443
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:21,832
MATT: Considering. And you holding it to the
ground was important, because it prevented it--

444
00:32:21,832 --> 00:32:28,558
because its breath weapon is a line, it limited
its range and what any powerful dragon does to its

445
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:34,514
advantage is stays in the air and uses-- Those few
rounds were key. Once it did get free, you saw how

446
00:32:34,514 --> 00:32:40,876
fast it could turn in a negative position for a
group. And the chains were good. It sacrificed

447
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:45,260
damage, but it also raised the DC of its ability
to escape from the grapple that was holding it on

448
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:50,454
the ground. You guys did a really good job and had
some rolls going in your favor, but

449
00:32:50,503 --> 00:32:53,176
once it started turning over and it escaped, it
went south very quick.

450
00:32:53,176 --> 00:32:54,965
MARISHA: But we have him on the run.

451
00:32:54,965 --> 00:32:56,804
MATT: You have him on the run. Kind of?

452
00:32:56,804 --> 00:32:58,592
ASHLEY: That was the worst cliffhanger of a game.

453
00:32:58,592 --> 00:33:02,479
MATT: I know! It wasn't my intent! I had to
sleep.

454
00:33:02,479 --> 00:33:03,981
ASHLEY: I know, I know.

455
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:09,066
MARISHA: Someone asked a question, when are you
getting shirts on Geek and Sundry that says 'Your

456
00:33:09,066 --> 00:33:10,524
'Fun Is Wrong'?

457
00:33:10,524 --> 00:33:17,744
MATT: (laughs) I don't know. That's a polarizing
term in the community. I'm glad and I'm excited

458
00:33:17,744 --> 00:33:22,497
that people are passionate enough to be so
invested that they are frustrated that things they

459
00:33:22,497 --> 00:33:25,678
came up with didn't happen, or that they saw
circumstances that outside of the game could have

460
00:33:25,678 --> 00:33:29,312
worked. To me, I think those discussions are
great. There are some people that take it too far

461
00:33:29,312 --> 00:33:35,216
and actually make verbal attacks on the players
via social media, or go out of their way to use

462
00:33:35,216 --> 00:33:44,478
those circumstances to really be unfairly dark and
necessarily down on us, and I'm like, those are

463
00:33:44,478 --> 00:33:47,707
shitty. And those are more of what that's
referring to. But overall, I love the discussion,

464
00:33:47,707 --> 00:33:51,637
and I think it's great. Everyone will handle a
situation differently, and I love people who will

465
00:33:51,637 --> 00:33:59,141
have those talks. So I don't know if the
#yourfuniswrong is in a good enough spirit to put

466
00:33:59,141 --> 00:34:02,971
on a shirt. I do eventually want to do a 'You Can
Certainly Try' shirt.

467
00:34:02,971 --> 00:34:05,218
MARISHA: I think 'You Can Certainly Try' is next.

468
00:34:05,218 --> 00:34:10,608
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's the darkest thing that we
ever hear in the game. "You can certainly try."

469
00:34:10,608 --> 00:34:12,196
MATT: (laughs) I love it so much.

470
00:34:12,196 --> 00:34:15,910
TALIESIN: I'll roll my die to spite you.

471
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:24,939
MATT: All right. Let's find another question here.
Let's see.

472
00:34:24,939 --> 00:34:31,546
MARISHA: Someone asked if Keyleth was a
vegetarian. Again, no. She's not. She's a druid.

473
00:34:31,546 --> 00:34:33,534
She just acts like it.

474
00:34:33,534 --> 00:34:36,846
(laughter)

475
00:34:36,846 --> 00:34:42,437
MATT: From GeekSpiral on reddit. For Ashley. "Do
the Blindspot writers work out the Critical Role

476
00:34:42,437 --> 00:34:44,579
"references with you, or do they sneak it in
themselves?"

477
00:34:44,579 --> 00:34:53,440
ASHLEY: They asked-- when I brought the mug to
set, because I asked them, I was like, "I want to

478
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:59,209
"have one mug that my character uses." And they
were like, "Okay, pick out a mug," and I was like,

479
00:34:59,209 --> 00:35:04,111
oh, I already have one. And I brought the Critical
Role mug and they were like, "Oh, cool. What is

480
00:35:04,111 --> 00:35:07,962
"this?" And I was like, "Just the coolest thing
ever. Don't worry about it. This is what I'm

481
00:35:07,962 --> 00:35:12,902
"using." But then I couldn't do it for so many
episodes because it had to be cleared by NBC. And

482
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:17,379
they're like, "Well, what is this Critical Role?"
And I'm like, "Well!" So I had to go through and,

483
00:35:17,379 --> 00:35:21,659
they're like, "Can we use it?" I was like, "Of
course." Yeah. And I was like, "Well, it's a

484
00:35:21,659 --> 00:35:23,771
"Dungeons &amp; Dragons game I play with my friends--"

485
00:35:23,771 --> 00:35:28,793
MARISHA: Well, it's online, Grandma. It's online.
No, no, it's not like on TV.

486
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,396
TALIESIN: It's not the email.

487
00:35:30,396 --> 00:35:38,447
ASHLEY: And then with the writers, I think they
started hearing about it. Some of them have

488
00:35:38,447 --> 00:35:45,326
started watching it, which is so funny. And then
they started adding little stuff here and there

489
00:35:45,326 --> 00:35:51,044
about that my character plays Dungeons &amp; Dragons.
And then the last one with the gnome cleric, I

490
00:35:51,044 --> 00:35:56,496
didn't tell them that. I just read the script.
Yeah, and then when I read the script, the person

491
00:35:56,496 --> 00:36:01,629
who had written that episode, he came over and he
was like, "Yeah, because I watched it, and I know

492
00:36:01,629 --> 00:36:04,790
"you're a gnome cleric," and I was like, "This is
the best day ever."

493
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:06,721
(laughter)

494
00:36:06,721 --> 00:36:13,903
ASHLEY: It was like my favorite day at work. My
favorite episode, yeah. My favorite scene that I

495
00:36:13,903 --> 00:36:20,677
shot. So I was like, that made my day. Made my
day!

496
00:36:20,677 --> 00:36:32,560
LIAM: I get asked frequently if I'm ever going to
DM a one-shot for our show, like when you're out

497
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:39,418
of town. Theoretically like a year from now or
more, if you wanted to go to Aruba or Burning Man

498
00:36:39,418 --> 00:36:44,281
or whatever. Maybe in a year or so. But I'm
playing with kids. The kids have low expectations

499
00:36:44,281 --> 00:36:50,713
or no expectations. I don't remember any of the
rules. Seeing all of the Quivering Palm business

500
00:36:50,713 --> 00:36:57,685
and dragon fight business, I'm not ready for that.
Talk to me in a year. But I do it at home. It's

501
00:36:57,755 --> 00:36:59,131
great. My kids love it.

502
00:36:59,131 --> 00:37:02,001
TALIESIN: You guys are intimidating out there.
Legitimately.

503
00:37:02,001 --> 00:37:06,144
MATT: It's one thing to play a game. It's another
to play it on the internet where a lot of people

504
00:37:06,144 --> 00:37:12,331
can tell you immediately what you did wrong. But
we're still having fun.

505
00:37:12,331 --> 00:37:14,926
LIAM: So far.

506
00:37:14,926 --> 00:37:21,235
ASHLEY: I like this one. Somebody asked, "What do
you think is your character's biggest fault?"

507
00:37:21,235 --> 00:37:26,397
TALIESIN: Oh, I saw that rolling through. It's a good one.

508
00:37:26,458 --> 00:37:28,333
MATT: What do you think is your biggest fault,
guys?

509
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:30,201
MARISHA: I feel like some of them are apparent,
right?

510
00:37:30,201 --> 00:37:32,495
MATT: That you can say.

511
00:37:32,495 --> 00:37:45,384
MARISHA: Our biggest fault. I guess her tragic
flaw? Extreme self-loathing and guilt. Fairly

512
00:37:45,384 --> 00:37:53,127
transparent on that one there, I think. Yeah,
Keyleth pretty much hates everything she does and

513
00:37:53,127 --> 00:37:56,167
feels worthless. Yeah.

514
00:37:56,167 --> 00:37:59,862
MATT: There you go. (laughs) To bring it up on
you, guys.

515
00:37:59,862 --> 00:38:06,229
TALIESIN: I'd say an interesting mix for Percy of
self-loathing, which is definitely a big thing for

516
00:38:06,229 --> 00:38:12,761
him too, and the unbridled belief that his parents
put into him that he's the only adult in the room.

517
00:38:12,761 --> 00:38:17,923
Someone also said, "Is it fair to call Percy the
Doctor Doom of his world?" No, he is definitely

518
00:38:17,923 --> 00:38:22,762
the Reed Richards of his world. And if you read
Fantastic Four, you will know that Reed Richards

519
00:38:22,762 --> 00:38:25,756
is a terrible person. He's a terrible, terrible
person.

520
00:38:25,756 --> 00:38:29,754
MATT: Like that. You, Vax?

521
00:38:29,754 --> 00:38:35,427
LIAM: Well, I think that Vax has a little bit of
self-loathing, too. I don't know, people think

522
00:38:35,427 --> 00:38:41,512
that Vax thinks he's a Boy Scout. I don't. And I
don't think he does either. For the backstory, I

523
00:38:41,512 --> 00:38:51,597
was a thief for years. I did shitty things and
stole from people so he could get by. I think he

524
00:38:51,597 --> 00:38:56,263
at this point in life feels like he's been a
fuck-up and a waste of time most of his life, and

525
00:38:56,263 --> 00:38:59,664
the only good thing he's had in his whole life is
his relationship with his sister, which is like

526
00:38:59,664 --> 00:39:03,426
one, good, true thing. But everything else,
they're dead-enders.

527
00:39:03,426 --> 00:39:06,459
ASHLEY: No, he's not!

528
00:39:06,459 --> 00:39:14,061
LIAM: Well, maybe. Maybe things are changing. But
that's what he was. And then also he follows his

529
00:39:14,061 --> 00:39:15,958
heart now, to a fault.

530
00:39:15,958 --> 00:39:20,270
MATT: Right. And you, Pike?

531
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:33,869
ASHLEY: Gosh. Pike is-- Perfect. Just no faults
whatsoever. No. Gosh. I think that with the death

532
00:39:33,869 --> 00:39:44,380
that was before the stream, I think she felt like
she was not as helpful in the group, and I think

533
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:53,353
that sticks with her, with trying to be like, "I
need to earn my place!" Yeah, I don't know. She's

534
00:39:53,353 --> 00:39:57,009
got some weird stuff with her family, which we
haven't really gotten into, because she comes from

535
00:39:57,009 --> 00:40:04,629
the deep gnomes. They're a little bit of
tricksters. Hence the last name Trickfoot. It

536
00:40:04,629 --> 00:40:13,288
probably would be the equivalent of coming from--
I don't want to say that, because it sounds so

537
00:40:13,288 --> 00:40:14,945
judgmental. Never mind.

538
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:16,989
MARISHA: We're all degenerates. We're all
fuck-ups.

539
00:40:16,989 --> 00:40:22,746
LIAM: And that's what we love about them. None of
us are trying to be white as snow. Even those of

540
00:40:22,746 --> 00:40:28,825
us who think they mean the most good for the
world, we're all fuck-ups. We're going to continue

541
00:40:28,825 --> 00:40:30,046
to fuck up.

542
00:40:30,046 --> 00:40:35,205
MATT: Yeah. I'm going to do a couple quick Twitter
questions here rapid-fire, so we can get through

543
00:40:35,205 --> 00:40:39,516
some of these. Taliesin, did Matt tell you about
the demon in the gun, or when did he?

544
00:40:39,516 --> 00:40:45,718
TALIESIN: No, he didn't tell. I found out when you
did! Yay!

545
00:40:45,718 --> 00:40:51,337
MATT: (laughs) He knew Orthax, or he knew that
some sort of smoke entity had attached to him and

546
00:40:51,337 --> 00:40:54,999
made an offer, but you didn't know what bound it
to you, and it was the weapon, yeah.

547
00:40:54,999 --> 00:40:57,843
TALIESIN: Nothing at all. I didn't even know. I
left it open to have just been nothing. It could

548
00:40:57,843 --> 00:41:02,503
have just been that he had a dream one night and
went nuts. It literally could have been nothing.

549
00:41:02,503 --> 00:41:04,092
LIAM: You clever bastard.

550
00:41:04,092 --> 00:41:08,799
MATT: It's fun. The fact that Sam caught up on
that and got rid of it was one of my favorite

551
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:12,499
character moments for him. Because that was going
to stick around.

552
00:41:12,499 --> 00:41:13,911
TALIESIN: I want my gun back!

553
00:41:13,911 --> 00:41:16,626
ASHLEY: No you don't! You do not need it!

554
00:41:16,626 --> 00:41:18,095
MATT: Build a new one!

555
00:41:18,095 --> 00:41:21,192
TALIESIN: I haven't had time! Everything keeps
exploding!

556
00:41:21,192 --> 00:41:23,218
MATT: I know. (laughs) It keeps exploding?

557
00:41:23,218 --> 00:41:28,616
TALIESIN: If something could stop blowing up for
five minutes, I'll finish four projects around the

558
00:41:28,616 --> 00:41:31,061
house. Waffle iron.

559
00:41:31,061 --> 00:41:32,856
ASHLEY: There's so many questions. Ooh!

560
00:41:32,856 --> 00:41:34,784
MATT: Yeah, there's a lot of questions. Any you
want to pick up on?

561
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:36,379
ASHLEY: No, I've already asked a lot.

562
00:41:36,379 --> 00:41:39,173
LIAM: Laura says by text, is the chat not
working?

563
00:41:39,173 --> 00:41:40,573
MATT: Chat's working.

564
00:41:40,573 --> 00:41:43,735
TALIESIN: Maybe their video is broken.

565
00:41:43,735 --> 00:41:45,369
LIAM: Chat's working, La.

566
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:49,119
ASHLEY: Hi, Laura! Hi, Twavis!

567
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:53,070
LIAM: Hi! Are you guys on the other side of the
planet now?

568
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:58,458
MATT: Someone asks, did Sam get experience for
destroying the gun? Yes, he did. Moments like

569
00:41:58,458 --> 00:42:02,515
that, key moments, big story moments like that,
those are the marks I make. Those are like the

570
00:42:02,515 --> 00:42:07,958
bump-experience bonuses. He got a few hash marks
for figuring that out, and finding a way to make

571
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:10,448
it happen without you murdering him in the
process.

572
00:42:10,448 --> 00:42:12,052
(laughter)

573
00:42:12,052 --> 00:42:15,582
TALIESIN: Yeah, that was very impressive.

574
00:42:15,582 --> 00:42:31,057
MARISHA: Here's a question that I actually get a
lot. This was from @tiamat_zx on Twitter. Why was

575
00:42:31,057 --> 00:42:35,172
Keyleth hostile towards Kima in the past? In the
very beginning?

576
00:42:35,172 --> 00:42:37,430
LIAM: Shifty eyes.

577
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:47,006
MARISHA: Yeah. You can't trust her shifty eyes.
No, a lot of it's starting to slowly be revealed

578
00:42:47,006 --> 00:42:56,908
now, actually, I feel like. But Keyleth doesn't
trust really any type of religious establishment.

579
00:42:56,908 --> 00:43:03,307
It's not necessarily where she comes from, and I
think she's had a few bad experiences. Enough in

580
00:43:03,307 --> 00:43:12,688
the past to where she's seen the corruption of a
church. And at the time, Kima was full-heartedly

581
00:43:12,688 --> 00:43:17,619
running into a blaze of glory and death and we
were sent there to go grab her with really no

582
00:43:17,619 --> 00:43:25,687
other lead on who she actually was or what she
actually wanted. I didn't trust that.

583
00:43:25,687 --> 00:43:29,141
TALIESIN: She's not exactly Miss Charming either,
is she?

584
00:43:29,141 --> 00:43:34,435
MARISHA: Right. And I think we happened to have
two personality types. Like, Keyleth and Kima had

585
00:43:34,435 --> 00:43:36,495
two personality types that butted heads.

586
00:43:36,495 --> 00:43:45,818
MATT: Yeah. It's true. Question here real fast:
@matthewmercer, do you discuss the night's events

587
00:43:45,818 --> 00:43:49,816
in the car ride home or days later, together with
Marisha, I guess is what they're referring to?

588
00:43:49,816 --> 00:43:54,510
Yeah, on the ride home, we'll definitely be like,
"That was crazy." And we'll recall events that

589
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:58,725
happened, and she'll mention things or ask
questions, and I'll say, "I don't know," and

590
00:43:58,725 --> 00:43:59,793
she'll get angry at me.

591
00:43:59,793 --> 00:44:01,015
MARISHA: That's mainly most of it.

592
00:44:01,015 --> 00:44:08,218
MATT: Yeah. It's also about why chat is so toxic.
Like, guys, calm down, it's okay, it's a game.

593
00:44:08,218 --> 00:44:12,593
Calm down about Keyleth, guys. She's having a fun
time.

594
00:44:12,593 --> 00:44:18,374
LIAM: We're not deciding laws in the Supreme
Court. We're being doofuses.

595
00:44:18,374 --> 00:44:23,007
MARISHA: I'm the awkward, unlikeable one. I get
it.

596
00:44:23,007 --> 00:44:26,478
MATT: Well, the interesting point was, we were
talking about that. It was like, "Why is there

597
00:44:26,478 --> 00:44:30,928
"this polarizing anger about Keyleth out there?"
And I think a lot of it may come from the fact

598
00:44:30,928 --> 00:44:37,301
that you are, your character by nature is, an
awkward character, who isn't the heroic,

599
00:44:37,301 --> 00:44:45,691
grandstanding hero, isn't the trickster, Han Solo
rogue, and as that personality type, against a

600
00:44:45,691 --> 00:44:48,805
banner of other characters who fit more in those
realms.

601
00:44:48,805 --> 00:44:52,726
TALIESIN: Let's stick a Miyazaki princess in the
middle of the show and see what happens. That'll

602
00:44:52,726 --> 00:44:53,640
be great.

603
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,712
MATT: Essentially!

604
00:44:54,712 --> 00:44:55,810
LIAM: 16 years old, jaded.

605
00:44:55,810 --> 00:44:57,278
(laughter)

606
00:44:57,278 --> 00:45:00,937
LIAM: Tatted up the sleeves, and Princess Mononoke
dropped in the middle.

607
00:45:00,937 --> 00:45:06,517
MATT: Yeah, it's an interesting psychology
experiment to think about that, from my

608
00:45:06,517 --> 00:45:11,474
standpoint. I think Keyleth's a great character.
Completely unbiased, from a DM's standpoint.

609
00:45:11,474 --> 00:45:15,815
TALIESIN: I like everybody. I'm horrified by the
thought of losing any of us--

610
00:45:15,815 --> 00:45:17,559
MATT: I'm horrified and excited.

611
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:18,731
TALIESIN: I know.

612
00:45:18,731 --> 00:45:23,578
MATT: I know that sounds awful, but from a
narrative standpoint-- I'm never going to force

613
00:45:23,578 --> 00:45:26,014
it, by any means, so if people are like, "Matt
killed someone." I'm like, I'm not going to kill

614
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:29,707
anybody on purpose. I'm going to let circumstances
work out. So far there have been a couple close

615
00:45:29,707 --> 00:45:33,972
calls. One of these days, one of those dice is
going to roll lower than that resurrection DC.

616
00:45:33,972 --> 00:45:35,865
LIAM: Close calls are getting closer and closer
together, Matt.

617
00:45:35,865 --> 00:45:39,356
MATT: I know. Hey! Stakes are escalating, guys!

618
00:45:39,356 --> 00:45:46,664
LIAM: Could you give us a list of the easiest
encounters to the hardest? Or could you put a

619
00:45:46,664 --> 00:45:51,670
skull next to the super-hard ones like in Fallout,
where you're not supposed to go near the bad guy

620
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:53,310
because the skull is floating there?

621
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:54,737
MATT: There's an ancient dragon.

622
00:45:54,737 --> 00:45:56,313
LIAM: I didn't want to fight it!

623
00:45:56,313 --> 00:46:01,007
TALIESIN: I thought we weren't, and then suddenly,
oh, this is happening now!

624
00:46:01,007 --> 00:46:03,211
LIAM: We need to go get some of these things and
come back.

625
00:46:03,211 --> 00:46:04,921
MARISHA: About fighting the dragon?

626
00:46:04,921 --> 00:46:06,812
LIAM: Yeah! I said it like 20 times.

627
00:46:06,812 --> 00:46:11,055
MATT: Hey, man, depending on how this works out,
some lessons will be learned, and hopefully

628
00:46:11,055 --> 00:46:15,617
prepare you for the next encounter a little
better. Depending on who's left.

629
00:46:15,617 --> 00:46:22,697
ASHLEY: I don't like the sound of that. "How this
turns out." I know, maybe we let him-- after we

630
00:46:22,697 --> 00:46:23,832
get you out, run.

631
00:46:23,832 --> 00:46:28,580
MARISHA: They're going to be so angry at us, those
dragons.

632
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:39,294
ASHLEY: It would be really interesting with this
group, though, if someone did have to reroll a

633
00:46:39,294 --> 00:46:45,401
character, since we all do already know each other
so well. That would be a very interesting dynamic.

634
00:46:45,401 --> 00:46:52,014
MARISHA: I feel like it'd be like transferring
high schools, and you're the new kid in class,

635
00:46:52,014 --> 00:46:54,948
walking in for the first time, and you're like,
"Hey."

636
00:46:54,948 --> 00:47:00,974
LIAM: Also, the whole cast is this-- we're all
very ripened, mature characters with lots of

637
00:47:00,974 --> 00:47:06,018
nuance, and the first one will be like, "Hey, I'm
a new bard! Where are my spells?"

638
00:47:06,018 --> 00:47:11,369
MARISHA: I've had that legitimate fear, because
when we came into this, we were already two years

639
00:47:11,369 --> 00:47:18,067
into our characters, and I was like, jeez, it took
us a while to find them and make them as deep and

640
00:47:18,067 --> 00:47:19,632
complex as they are.

641
00:47:19,632 --> 00:47:22,431
LIAM: Although when you play every week, we used
to play every six weeks, so things were a little

642
00:47:22,431 --> 00:47:24,280
shallower at home, and now...

643
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:27,126
MATT: Yeah, it's going to be interesting.

644
00:47:27,126 --> 00:47:30,891
ASHLEY: Let's make it not happen.

645
00:47:30,891 --> 00:47:38,275
MATT: Yeah. Just make sure you pay attention to
the lore and the previous experiences you've had

646
00:47:38,275 --> 00:47:40,024
with dangerous entities.

647
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:41,385
LIAM: There is a lot of lore, Matt.

648
00:47:41,385 --> 00:47:43,107
MARISHA: I feel like he's feeding us hints.

649
00:47:43,107 --> 00:47:44,112
ASHLEY: I know.

650
00:47:44,112 --> 00:47:48,700
TALIESIN: For the first time ever, I feel like
Matt is actually--

651
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:53,618
MATT: I've told you nothing, I just like messing
with you guys.

652
00:47:53,618 --> 00:48:00,534
LIAM: Somebody asked how you and I avoid
awkwardness in real life after Vax and Keyleth moments.

653
00:48:00,534 --> 00:48:03,105
TALIESIN: You guys are really awkward. It's
weird.

654
00:48:03,105 --> 00:48:07,544
MARISHA: Who are you, the chat room?

655
00:48:07,544 --> 00:48:13,558
LIAM: We're pretty cool with it. It's like an
acting gig, really.

656
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:15,823
MARISHA: Yeah, we're mature adults, I think.

657
00:48:15,823 --> 00:48:20,963
ASHLEY: We're probably all more awkward with it.
We're all like, how do you feel?

658
00:48:20,963 --> 00:48:27,384
MARISHA: Okay, I will say that Liam and I walked
away, we were like, "Wait. No one flinched at a

659
00:48:27,384 --> 00:48:32,807
"Scanlan and Pike scene." No one flinched.

660
00:48:32,807 --> 00:48:36,061
LIAM: Not at all. Everyone crawled inside their
own assholes when we had our--

661
00:48:36,061 --> 00:48:39,074
ASHLEY: I think because you guys had the maiden
voyage.

662
00:48:39,074 --> 00:48:40,939
LIAM: That's right. We were pioneers.

663
00:48:40,939 --> 00:48:47,467
ASHLEY: You were the pioneers, and we all learned
from that moment of, oh, you can have moments like

664
00:48:47,467 --> 00:48:51,254
these, and everybody has to not be 12 about it.

665
00:48:51,254 --> 00:48:55,334
LIAM: It was like that moment when you first get
to prison and they put you on the wall and take

666
00:48:55,334 --> 00:48:57,381
the hose and bring it.

667
00:48:57,444 --> 00:49:00,516
MARISHA: Hey, stings!

668
00:49:00,516 --> 00:49:04,090
LIAM: Hey, do you maybe want to go out sometime, I
kind of like you, ow!

669
00:49:04,090 --> 00:49:08,356
ASHLEY: I know, we were the worst. We were the
worst.

670
00:49:08,356 --> 00:49:14,456
MATT: I'm going to pull up another Reddit question
here.

671
00:49:14,456 --> 00:49:16,008
LIAM: Laura and/or Travis.

672
00:49:16,008 --> 00:49:17,169
MARISHA: They're not here.

673
00:49:17,169 --> 00:49:19,029
LIAM: I'll answer for Travis.

674
00:49:19,029 --> 00:49:20,496
MARISHA: I'll answer for Laura.

675
00:49:20,496 --> 00:49:22,190
MATT: There you go. You guys should do that.

676
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:26,096
LIAM: (Grog voice) What? What?

677
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:29,269
MARISHA: Wink. Wink. Wink.

678
00:49:29,269 --> 00:49:33,472
MATT: Let's see. "Ashley. Do you prefer as a
player to watch things unfold, or do you want to

679
00:49:33,472 --> 00:49:37,377
"be in the driver's seat more? Also, would you ever
convert anyone to worshipping Sarenrae?" From

680
00:49:37,377 --> 00:49:41,386
Jojorious on Reddit.

681
00:49:41,386 --> 00:49:53,803
ASHLEY: I think, for me personally, I still feel a
little like a newbie, in a way, because they've

682
00:49:53,803 --> 00:49:59,514
played so many games consistently, week after
week, and because of work, I still feel a little

683
00:49:59,514 --> 00:50:05,719
rusty. So for me, there's a part of me, not as
Pike, that likes to watch things unfold first

684
00:50:05,719 --> 00:50:10,424
before making a move, because I'm like, can I do
this? I'm a little unsure sometimes.

685
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:12,094
LIAM: That's Pike or that's Ashley, you're
saying?

686
00:50:12,094 --> 00:50:19,552
ASHLEY: That's Ashley. But I think I feel like
Pike is the same way, but I feel like these things

687
00:50:19,552 --> 00:50:26,229
blur together. But I think with Pike, it's almost
better to hang back because of being a cleric,

688
00:50:26,229 --> 00:50:34,897
because you can do a little clean-up after. Just,
who's hurt, who can we protect and keep alive and

689
00:50:34,897 --> 00:50:40,557
keep in the battle? There was another part to the
question.

690
00:50:40,557 --> 00:50:42,521
MATT: Oh, would you ever convert anyone to
worshipping Sarenrae?

691
00:50:42,521 --> 00:50:49,450
ASHLEY: Oh, yes. Probably not. I feel like with
Pike there's a lot of-- which we've had so many

692
00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:57,087
times talks in the game and out of game about how
Pike sometimes veers away from worshipping

693
00:50:57,087 --> 00:51:04,935
Sarenrae and wants to do bad things. I just want
to do bad things with my friends! Hoodrat things

694
00:51:04,935 --> 00:51:12,236
with my friends. Sometimes she can't. There are
consequences.

695
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:14,414
LIAM: You make Sarenrae look really good on the
outside.

696
00:51:14,414 --> 00:51:19,612
ASHLEY: Well, all right. I don't think Pike would ever
be like, "You need to convert to Sarenrae because

697
00:51:19,612 --> 00:51:22,252
"you're a bad person." So no.

698
00:51:22,252 --> 00:51:26,977
MARISHA: You will never be those protesters
outside of Comic-Con.

699
00:51:26,977 --> 00:51:30,343
ASHLEY: No, never ever ever.

700
00:51:30,343 --> 00:51:34,197
LIAM: Oh man, can we do a photoshoot with Ashley with
the sign for Sarenrae?

701
00:51:34,197 --> 00:51:35,960
(laughter)

702
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,182
MATT: Standing out on a street corner at
Comic-Con?

703
00:51:37,182 --> 00:51:38,610
ASHLEY: Done, we're doing it.

704
00:51:38,610 --> 00:51:46,612
MATT: Question real fast from Atlas_Adams on
Reddit, saying: "Do the Vestiges still draw their

705
00:51:46,612 --> 00:51:54,558
"power from the deities? If so, wouldn't they not
work for a person who is disloyal?" I'm not going

706
00:51:54,558 --> 00:52:00,746
to go too deep into that. I will say that not
everyone who was part of the battle and the whole

707
00:52:00,746 --> 00:52:06,053
Divergence itself was a religious individual. Many
of the artifacts did stem from religious power.

708
00:52:06,053 --> 00:52:11,698
Some of them also from arcane secrets. Not
everything is tied to a specific deity, per se.

709
00:52:11,698 --> 00:52:21,230
Also, there's two sides to every battle. Not going
to say any more than that.

710
00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:33,262
MARISHA: Someone said, I think it's supposed to be
@Alkie on Twitter, "How did Mary Elizabeth and

711
00:52:33,262 --> 00:52:37,220
"other guests come about? Are you friends with them
and they just wanted to join?"

712
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:50,246
MATT: My apologies. I was looking for another
question, thinking that was to you. My apologies. Well--

713
00:52:50,246 --> 00:52:52,393
MARISHA: "Are they friends and wanted to join?"

714
00:52:52,393 --> 00:52:55,405
TALIESIN: Not really. Just kidding.

715
00:52:55,405 --> 00:52:59,853
MATT: Mary had never played before and had not
really exhibited interest when we first-- she was

716
00:52:59,853 --> 00:53:02,265
invited to the very first session that we were
going to run, but she couldn't make it, she was

717
00:53:02,265 --> 00:53:06,258
like, "I don't know." But then hearing all the
stories over the years of us playing privately,

718
00:53:06,258 --> 00:53:11,416
she was like, "Oh, this sounds like fun." I'm
like, "Yeah, I already have too many players. Sorry."

719
00:53:11,416 --> 00:53:14,095
LIAM: Knew she'd be good at it, though.

720
00:53:14,095 --> 00:53:18,722
MATT: I know. She'd never played an RPG before.
When we had the opportunity to bring guests on the

721
00:53:18,722 --> 00:53:23,623
show, it was like, oh, we have to see if Mary can
make it. And Will, who I'd worked with on

722
00:53:23,623 --> 00:53:28,554
Thundercats and a few other projects between,
he's a huge fantasy buff, as you've seen in the

723
00:53:28,554 --> 00:53:32,909
previous Q&amp;A. He loves fantasy, but he'd never
played an RPG before. We had conversations about

724
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:37,338
D&amp;D back when we began our campaign, and he kept
asking about it, and I could see that twinkle in

725
00:53:37,338 --> 00:53:40,588
his eye of interest, and I was like, "Well, we
have a guest spot coming up. Would you be

726
00:53:40,588 --> 00:53:44,563
"interested in playing?" He was like, "I have no
idea what I'm doing. Sure." And so we got together

727
00:53:44,563 --> 00:53:49,321
at the Coral Cafe, and we built a character, went
over the rules a bit, and he's like, "I still

728
00:53:49,321 --> 00:53:53,676
"don't know what I'm doing, but sure." And he did
great, and the dynamic's been fantastic, and I'm

729
00:53:53,676 --> 00:53:56,752
glad they had an opportunity to actually
play together when they came back for a couple

730
00:53:56,752 --> 00:53:58,154
episodes. That was cool.

731
00:53:58,154 --> 00:53:59,525
LIAM: Back in seven seconds.

732
00:53:59,525 --> 00:54:03,771
MARISHA: I love that, in classic Windows fashion,
the tablet decided to update and restart in the

733
00:54:03,771 --> 00:54:08,086
middle of all this, so we don't have access to the
chat anymore.

734
00:54:08,086 --> 00:54:17,107
MATT: Good job, Windows Surface. Windows Surface kicks ass.
We'll get back to you, chatroom, here, in a minute.

735
00:54:17,107 --> 00:54:20,866
TALIESIN: Twitter asks, "When making sketches for
inventions, does Matt ever shut you down, or 'you

736
00:54:20,866 --> 00:54:27,560
"'can certainly try' you?" And, no, usually if it
comes to the sketch point, it's the, "I don't

737
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:32,664
"understand what you want to do, please explain to
me what you want to do", and I'm pretty good-- I

738
00:54:32,664 --> 00:54:40,277
try really hard not to push the technology of
anything Percy makes past 1901, 1880. I'm not

739
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:43,835
looking to bring the Vietnam era to D&amp;D.

740
00:54:43,835 --> 00:54:46,004
(laughter)

741
00:54:46,004 --> 00:54:53,875
TALIESIN: Machine guns are fancy and wonderful,
but I'm shooting musket balls, so I don't even

742
00:54:53,875 --> 00:55:02,897
have bullet technology yet. And even with the
lightning glove, I sent sketches of something that

743
00:55:02,897 --> 00:55:05,019
would sort of pretty much work. I don't

744
00:55:05,019 --> 00:55:08,959
know what would have happened if you hit it with
lightning, but it was definitely a rudimentary

745
00:55:08,959 --> 00:55:11,966
electrical generation system that would have fit
in a glove.

746
00:55:11,966 --> 00:55:17,407
MATT: Yeah. There's, for Percy, this consideration
of what your ideas are versus what, number one,

747
00:55:17,407 --> 00:55:22,898
would be functional in the world, two, how far,
these designs, could you actually produce based on

748
00:55:22,898 --> 00:55:27,509
your experience in the engineering realm. Even
things that were available in a historical sense,

749
00:55:27,509 --> 00:55:32,426
in certain time periods, those were people that
spent their entire life steeped in these feats of

750
00:55:32,426 --> 00:55:38,716
engineering. Whenever you bring me an idea, it
would be like trying to marry what you're trying

751
00:55:38,716 --> 00:55:43,123
to accomplish versus what would be viable within
the game, and finding balance as it is, but an

752
00:55:43,123 --> 00:55:44,865
aspect of your class features.

753
00:55:44,865 --> 00:55:50,366
TALIESIN: I have no interest in breaking the world
any further than where his story is literally that

754
00:55:50,366 --> 00:55:53,585
he broke the world, which I'm sure will come up
again at some point.

755
00:55:53,585 --> 00:55:55,462
MATT: What are you talking about? I can't imagine
it'll ever come up.

756
00:55:55,462 --> 00:55:56,833
TALIESIN: No. That's fine. It's all over.

757
00:55:56,833 --> 00:56:07,445
MARISHA: @NerdyEquestrian on Twitter: "Is there
something growing between Vex and Percy?"

758
00:56:07,445 --> 00:56:16,619
LIAM: Actually, hold that thought. Because I have
a question that's not the same question, it's not

759
00:56:16,619 --> 00:56:21,973
for me, but it's related to that, and that is,
"Who is Pike in love with?" And I don't want an

760
00:56:21,973 --> 00:56:26,893
answer. Instead I'd ask the audience, people who
are asking questions like that or what's in the

761
00:56:26,893 --> 00:56:31,821
letter. Don't you think that's like asking while
you're reading the first Harry Potter book why

762
00:56:31,821 --> 00:56:39,727
Harry wasn't killed by his nemesis? It's a book.
Do you really want to know the last chapter when

763
00:56:39,727 --> 00:56:40,961
you're in the first chapter?

764
00:56:40,961 --> 00:56:42,115
ASHLEY: Because we could tell you!

765
00:56:42,115 --> 00:56:44,811
LIAM: Wouldn't you rather the story unfold in
front of your eyes?

766
00:56:44,811 --> 00:56:49,367
MARISHA: There's a lot of
who-are-you-guys-jonesing-for questions about the

767
00:56:49,367 --> 00:56:50,754
two of you.

768
00:56:50,754 --> 00:56:57,316
TALIESIN: I don't talk about who I'm jonesing for,
in general. Percy does not talk about these things.

769
00:56:57,316 --> 00:56:58,677
LIAM: Taliesin or Percy?

770
00:56:58,677 --> 00:57:00,624
TALIESIN: Oh, Taliesin does. Taliesin will never
shut up about it.

771
00:57:00,624 --> 00:57:03,093
(laughter)

772
00:57:03,093 --> 00:57:06,693
TALIESIN: I am terrible, as everybody knows. I am
terrible at that.

773
00:57:06,693 --> 00:57:09,821
MATT: That's pretty great.

774
00:57:09,821 --> 00:57:11,919
TALIESIN: Yeah, Percy has no interest in--

775
00:57:11,919 --> 00:57:16,062
LIAM: What's in that letter, I would much rather,
as an audience member who gets to sit on the set

776
00:57:16,062 --> 00:57:21,501
while we play the game, see that come out in the
story and have my mind blown, rather than on

777
00:57:21,501 --> 00:57:25,438
Twitter be like, "Oh, well, it's this and this and
this and this." Just enjoy the roller coaster.

778
00:57:25,438 --> 00:57:27,560
MARISHA: I desperately want to know what's in the
letter.

779
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:28,792
ASHLEY: The letter!

780
00:57:28,792 --> 00:57:30,061
MATT: I want to know really bad.

781
00:57:30,061 --> 00:57:31,465
LIAM: I want to know at the right time!

782
00:57:31,465 --> 00:57:37,745
ASHLEY: That letter was so lovely that in the
game, there was about five minutes where I wanted

783
00:57:37,745 --> 00:57:43,946
to cry. Sam wrote this letter.

784
00:57:43,946 --> 00:57:45,823
LIAM: It's 30 shit jokes, isn't it?

785
00:57:45,823 --> 00:57:50,712
MATT: It's just dickbutts for four pages. So many
dickbutts.

786
00:57:50,712 --> 00:58:00,153
ASHLEY: But it was so beautifully written. He knew
nobody would see it, except for me, maybe unless I

787
00:58:00,153 --> 00:58:01,861
were to just post it and be a jerk about it.

788
00:58:01,861 --> 00:58:04,672
LIAM: I took a photo of it, but I deleted it. I
could have read it, but I didn't.

789
00:58:04,672 --> 00:58:07,063
ASHLEY: I know. You did. You could have read it.
But it was paragraphs and paragraphs that were so

790
00:58:07,063 --> 00:58:15,373
beautifully written, and that was a moment in the
game for me where I was like, "Does Pike have--

791
00:58:15,373 --> 00:58:22,746
"whoa! There could be a little something--
Scanlan!" Just because it was so beautiful, it

792
00:58:22,746 --> 00:58:31,524
made me pause. Life is so complicated! Yes, he
might have Cyrano de Bergerac-ed me. Who knows.

793
00:58:31,524 --> 00:58:33,538
That sounds a little weird.

794
00:58:33,538 --> 00:58:35,522
LIAM: You just got cubed.

795
00:58:35,522 --> 00:58:40,700
MATT: Lucas, real fast, we lost the chat room over
here on the tablet, if you could get that going.

796
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:43,034
MARISHA: Windows decided to update. It's not your
fault.

797
00:58:43,034 --> 00:58:44,982
MATT: It was like, oh, hey, guys, updating,
because Windows.

798
00:58:44,982 --> 00:58:46,364
LUCAS: It does that.

799
00:58:46,364 --> 00:58:50,773
MATT: As a hardcore PC user, you get used to it.
I've been using Windows 7 for so long, and every

800
00:58:50,773 --> 00:58:54,611
two days, it's like, "You want Windows 10? You
<i>sure</i> you don't want Windows 10? Here's Windows 10!"

801
00:58:54,611 --> 00:58:56,037
ASHLEY: "I'm just going to give it to you."

802
00:58:56,037 --> 00:58:57,888
MATT: "All you've got to do is press this button.
You've just got to press this red button right

803
00:58:57,888 --> 00:59:02,992
"here." You can't really click anywhere else but
the button. All the buttons install Windows 10.

804
00:59:02,992 --> 00:59:08,421
Thanks, guys. And I finally was like, "Okay. I'll
install. I'll try this out." Five minutes later:

805
00:59:08,421 --> 00:59:18,890
back to Windows 7. I'll eventually get there, I'm
sure. Cool, thank you, buddy. "Matt, did you plant

806
00:59:18,890 --> 00:59:25,052
"Zahra's flying cloak and Vex's flying broom?" No.
The flying cloak she purchased with funds that her

807
00:59:25,052 --> 00:59:30,167
character had accrued up until that point, based
on what was established after the dragon fight,

808
00:59:30,167 --> 00:59:37,149
the first battle she did. Between the cloak and
the dragonslaying arrow are the two things she

809
00:59:37,149 --> 00:59:41,070
used all of her funds on. That was purely on her
end.

810
00:59:41,070 --> 00:59:42,567
(Windows startup noise)

811
00:59:42,567 --> 00:59:47,193
MATT: Oh, thank you! You're working! Updates are
installed. As far as the broom, that was purely

812
00:59:47,193 --> 00:59:50,661
chosen by Hardwick when we made his character.
With his funds that he was given, he was able to

813
00:59:50,661 --> 00:59:54,579
choose to spend it on items he wanted. He was
like, "Oh, flying broom! That looks cool. I'll

814
00:59:54,579 --> 00:59:57,920
"take that." And I was like, "All right. I know
who's going to want that." I immediately knew as

815
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:01,880
soon as it happened, if he pulls that out, who's
going to gun for it. And as soon as he did, Vex's

816
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:03,178
eyes went--

817
01:00:03,178 --> 01:00:04,644
ASHLEY: Gimme!

818
01:00:04,644 --> 01:00:11,261
MATT: I wasn't expecting that to happen. I think
Hardwick's still jokingly bent out of shape about

819
01:00:11,261 --> 01:00:14,914
it. I've seen him a few times. We went to Renn
Faire the week before last, and he was like, "I

820
01:00:14,914 --> 01:00:20,945
"got to get my broom back, man." And I'm like,
"Yeah, have fun with that. Good luck."

821
01:00:20,945 --> 01:00:22,381
TALIESIN: He'd have to come back on the show at
the very least.

822
01:00:22,381 --> 01:00:23,762
MATT: I know. We'll see.

823
01:00:23,762 --> 01:00:26,071
LIAM: Work on your sleight-of-hand technique.

824
01:00:26,071 --> 01:00:32,550
MATT: Exactly. Arcane casters can be tricksy. I'm
just glad he was able to guest. His schedule is so

825
01:00:32,550 --> 01:00:38,356
crazy. That was a lot of fun. Yeah, that broom was
fully on him. He brought it and he lost it.

826
01:00:38,356 --> 01:00:48,958
LIAM: I'll answer another quick Vaxleth question,
which is, what inspired it? I think that all

827
01:00:48,958 --> 01:00:53,785
during the home game, and even at the beginning of
the game on the show, Vax had the same opinion of

828
01:00:53,785 --> 01:00:59,282
Keyleth as his sister, which was, "Come on. Are
you serious?" most of the time. "Goody two-shoes?

829
01:00:59,282 --> 01:01:02,575
"Really?" I don't remember what it was, I promise I
don't remember what it was, but something happened

830
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:06,822
in one game. I remember thinking about it after
the show and then talking to Matt in the next day

831
01:01:06,822 --> 01:01:11,043
or two, going like, "Can you do this in Dungeons &amp;
Dragons? Like, would this be okay? Would you be

832
01:01:11,043 --> 01:01:15,431
"okay with it? I'm not going to go anywhere with
it, but would that be okay?" That's where it came

833
01:01:15,431 --> 01:01:21,223
from. And the reason I thought it would be fun for
the game is the same reason I think why Taliesin

834
01:01:21,223 --> 01:01:27,581
had Percy give Grog an evil, sentient sword.
Because it would make the game interesting. It

835
01:01:27,581 --> 01:01:33,741
would totally shift the game pieces on the board
and add new dynamics in unpredictable ways. I'm

836
01:01:33,741 --> 01:01:37,999
not treating it like a dating sim where the end
result for me playing D&amp;D was "winning the

837
01:01:37,999 --> 01:01:44,513
"princess". It's just to see how things could
change in the next year of gameplay.

838
01:01:44,513 --> 01:01:50,685
TALIESIN: Absolutely, there are decisions that you
make that are specifically like, I don't want my

839
01:01:50,685 --> 01:01:54,729
character to learn that much that quickly. I don't
want him to be that smart and that, "Well, I've

840
01:01:54,729 --> 01:01:59,067
"learned a valuable lesson about how to treat
people and how to--" Nope! Here. Yours. Cool.

841
01:01:59,067 --> 01:02:03,919
LIAM: It's been done this way for a year. Let's
see what happens if we move this over here and

842
01:02:03,919 --> 01:02:05,499
that over there.

843
01:02:05,499 --> 01:02:08,154
MARISHA: A lot of people think I'm leading Vax
on.

844
01:02:08,154 --> 01:02:11,519
LIAM: Ah, whatever. I'm having fun.

845
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:17,795
TALIESIN: It's fun. I'll say both Taliesin and
Percy are really amused by the entire situation.

846
01:02:17,795 --> 01:02:18,932
MARISHA: That's good.

847
01:02:18,932 --> 01:02:22,179
ASHLEY: Same. So is Ashley/Pike.

848
01:02:22,179 --> 01:02:27,661
MATT: Question from AaronShot on Reddit, saying,
"Matt, give us a little tease. When you talked

849
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:32,117
"about illegal substances being on the market in
Emon during one of the Q&amp;As at a con last year,

850
01:02:32,117 --> 01:02:36,308
"how much world-building have you done to date that
we have not seen yet? Wildemount, Marquet." As

851
01:02:36,308 --> 01:02:40,872
much as I can. It's a progressive thing I'm
developing and have been for years. Free time has

852
01:02:40,872 --> 01:02:48,818
not been copious. This show is a fantastic thing
every week that takes up a lot of my free time. We

853
01:02:48,818 --> 01:02:52,478
have a lot of cool things we have coming up that
we want to hopefully announce that take a lot of

854
01:02:52,478 --> 01:02:56,527
my free time. This is one thing that I'm always
working on. I have fleshed out a good portion of

855
01:02:56,527 --> 01:03:01,175
Marquet. I've fleshed out elements of Wildemount.
It's not as fleshed out as others. Othanzia and

856
01:03:01,175 --> 01:03:06,060
Tal'Dorei are the two most fleshed out in my
world, because those are the two where you guys

857
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:11,508
have spent your most time. Whenever this game's
done, we start a new campaign, it'll probably

858
01:03:11,508 --> 01:03:14,869
still be in Exandria, but it might start in
Marquet. It might start somewhere else in the

859
01:03:14,869 --> 01:03:19,240
world and have a whole different cultural flavor
and flair, and it'll be a whole different side to

860
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:24,367
this world. And there'll be references to and
history that exists that you would know, because

861
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:28,232
you were part of it before, but you'll be a whole
new group of adventurers in a whole different part

862
01:03:28,232 --> 01:03:29,826
of the world. That'll be fun.

863
01:03:29,826 --> 01:03:33,859
LIAM: I would say part of the reason that I didn't
want to fight Umbrasyl, most of it was because I

864
01:03:33,859 --> 01:03:37,868
didn't think we were ready. But part of it is
because I'm looking at this game like a game of

865
01:03:37,868 --> 01:03:41,387
Fallout. I want to go to the corners of the map. I
want to go to Marquet. I want to go to the bottom

866
01:03:41,387 --> 01:03:43,823
of the ocean. I want to go to all of these places
where the Vestiges are.

867
01:03:43,823 --> 01:03:45,320
MARISHA: I want to go off the map!

868
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:47,903
LIAM: Are we really mainlining the quest? Really?
That's what we're doing? What about all these side

869
01:03:47,903 --> 01:03:50,418
things that Matt's got? I want to be a
completionist.

870
01:03:50,418 --> 01:03:52,068
MARISHA: There's so much to do.

871
01:03:52,068 --> 01:03:56,383
MATT: You play it carefully, you still can.
Whatever that means.

872
01:03:56,383 --> 01:04:02,853
(nervous chatter and laughter)

873
01:04:02,853 --> 01:04:04,251
MATT: Oh, it's so much fun to mess with them.

874
01:04:04,251 --> 01:04:08,203
ASHLEY: People have asked this before, but I
actually like this question. "If you could play

875
01:04:08,203 --> 01:04:10,244
"another character in-game, who would you pick?"

876
01:04:10,244 --> 01:04:11,368
LIAM: One of the other characters?

877
01:04:11,368 --> 01:04:12,776
ASHLEY: One of the other characters.

878
01:04:12,776 --> 01:04:24,227
MARISHA: Grog. No holds barred. Like, zero fucks.
Kill shit. It's great. He's like the polar

879
01:04:24,227 --> 01:04:25,598
opposite of Keyleth.

880
01:04:25,598 --> 01:04:26,567
MATT: Yeah.

881
01:04:26,567 --> 01:04:32,134
MARISHA: It would be such a nice palate cleanser.
It would be so nice. To be able to be reckless

882
01:04:32,134 --> 01:04:37,884
and not care. Break people's necks whenever I want
to. Must be nice being Grog.

883
01:04:37,884 --> 01:04:43,637
LIAM: I would go Keyleth because I want access to
the broad range of magic, and I've been so

884
01:04:43,637 --> 01:04:49,886
non-magic the entire time. I don't know shit about
magic. I barely know anything. Yeah, Vax-- and

885
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:55,165
side note, before we go into this game, Vax is
totally impressed with Keyleth and thinks that

886
01:04:55,165 --> 01:05:00,653
she's the most powerful one in the group, and is
in awe of it, and feels like a weak dingus,

887
01:05:00,653 --> 01:05:03,875
basically, in comparison to everybody. To
everybody.

888
01:05:03,875 --> 01:05:06,562
ASHLEY: But you do so much damage!

889
01:05:06,562 --> 01:05:11,967
LIAM: That's fine. Not Liam! Vax looks at
everybody and is like, "Oh, my God! Look at you,

890
01:05:11,967 --> 01:05:17,570
"shining beacon of hope! Look at this crazy fucking
motherfucker who can build stuff out of a tin can!

891
01:05:17,570 --> 01:05:27,842
"Look at Scanlan, staring into the maw of horror
and stupidly thinking everything's okay! Look at

892
01:05:27,842 --> 01:05:29,601
"my sister, who's not scared of anything!"

893
01:05:29,601 --> 01:05:31,537
MARISHA: And look at how much we all hate
ourselves.

894
01:05:31,537 --> 01:05:36,937
MATT: Oh, that's pretty great.

895
01:05:36,937 --> 01:05:43,878
MATT: Vax is Sokka, someone said in the chat room.
Vax is Sokka from Avatar.

896
01:05:43,878 --> 01:05:50,165
MARISHA: Oh! We've got to find Sokka a master! Got
to find you your own sword!

897
01:05:50,165 --> 01:05:52,838
LIAM: I've seen the first three seasons of Korra,
but not the early one.

898
01:05:52,838 --> 01:05:55,562
MATT: Watch it with your kids. They'll love it.
Seriously. It's great.

899
01:05:55,562 --> 01:05:57,656
LIAM: Okay. I'll get there.

900
01:05:57,656 --> 01:06:06,115
MATT: (laughs) It says, "Gilmore started out as
kind of a caricature and was a fleshed-out

901
01:06:06,115 --> 01:06:11,304
"character--" Question went away, but Gilmore
didn't start out as a caricature in my head. I

902
01:06:11,304 --> 01:06:16,789
never want to make an NPC a caricature per se.
There are characters that have strong personality

903
01:06:16,789 --> 01:06:20,642
traits and they emerge themselves, because for an
NPC, you have to make an impact quickly. You don't

904
01:06:20,642 --> 01:06:25,040
have a lot of time with them, and you want to try
and make the world lively and interesting for your

905
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:30,476
players. So I have certain personality points that
are at the forefront of each personality. Gilmore

906
01:06:30,476 --> 01:06:35,001
to me was never a caricature, partially because I
built him around somebody I used to do theater

907
01:06:35,001 --> 01:06:41,728
with when I was younger in high school, so I
already had a personality print for him. But also

908
01:06:41,728 --> 01:06:50,917
I really wanted to show a character that could be
ostentatious and flamboyant in a way that was fun

909
01:06:50,917 --> 01:06:57,065
and not a caricature. If that didn't come across,
my apologies. Gilmore is a very charismatic, very

910
01:06:57,065 --> 01:07:01,029
outgoing salesman, and that's part of his job. He
uses that to his advantage.

911
01:07:01,029 --> 01:07:05,386
MARISHA: He's also very deep. I don't think any of us
have looked at him as a one-dimensional character.

912
01:07:05,386 --> 01:07:09,206
MATT: But people have their interpretations. I
care very much about the character.

913
01:07:09,206 --> 01:07:14,611
LIAM: First appearance, we were rolling laughing.
We didn't know what was coming. There was so much panache.

914
01:07:14,611 --> 01:07:19,699
MATT: That's his whole thing. He's a showman, and
that's so much of his personality. And as you guys

915
01:07:19,699 --> 01:07:23,972
got to know him better, especially you, he let you
peek behind the veil a bit and see--

916
01:07:23,972 --> 01:07:26,116
ASHLEY: Yeah, you peeked behind the veil.

917
01:07:26,116 --> 01:07:33,196
MATT: The world-wearied individual, there's a lot
of depth to the character.

918
01:07:33,196 --> 01:07:36,511
TALIESIN: I love your Scarlet Pimpernel--

919
01:07:36,511 --> 01:07:40,900
MATT: Very much so. Percival from Scarlet
Pimpernel-ish.

920
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:44,291
MARISHA: Also someone was asking if he was based
off of a real person.

921
01:07:44,291 --> 01:07:49,165
MATT: Yes, he was. He was based off a person in
high school that I did theater with. I'm not going

922
01:07:49,165 --> 01:07:50,764
to say who, because he's on Facebook.

923
01:07:50,764 --> 01:07:52,461
(laughter)

924
01:07:52,461 --> 01:07:56,117
LIAM: He's also been one of the greatest pleasures
for me for this game, because it wasn't anything

925
01:07:56,117 --> 01:08:01,378
that I saw coming. It was really funny and
surprising the first time at home, and then he

926
01:08:01,378 --> 01:08:06,664
came back several times, and right from the first
time that Gilmore appeared, he zeroed in on Vax

927
01:08:06,664 --> 01:08:12,300
and was sweet on Vax. It was nervous laughter the
first time, and then slowly over time it got more

928
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:17,419
charming, and more charming, up to the point where
you guys have seen that probably Vax is

929
01:08:17,419 --> 01:08:20,478
legitimately taken with him, definitely intrigued
by him.

930
01:08:20,478 --> 01:08:21,997
ASHLEY: He charmed your pants off.

931
01:08:21,997 --> 01:08:27,545
LIAM: Charmed my-- almost charmed my pants off.
Just before. And then some people are like, "It

932
01:08:27,545 --> 01:08:33,226
"should be Vax and Gilmore!" Like, I get it.
Gilmore's a great character, and Vax was

933
01:08:33,226 --> 01:08:40,697
definitely taken with him. We probably saw Gilmore
two to three weeks of the last three years? Maybe

934
01:08:40,697 --> 01:08:46,111
more? I've traveled-- Vax and Keyleth, though,
have been traveling together for years. So, I mean--

935
01:08:46,111 --> 01:08:47,974
ASHLEY: It's a deep-rooted love.

936
01:08:47,974 --> 01:08:51,879
MARISHA: And we were friends first, which is how
they always say you should do it.

937
01:08:51,879 --> 01:08:56,454
(laughter)

938
01:08:56,454 --> 01:09:01,141
MATT: I will say on that fact, too, because
someone asked this question, and they said there

939
01:09:01,141 --> 01:09:06,742
have been hints on the characters that have
exhibited LGBT relationships in the game, but a

940
01:09:06,742 --> 01:09:14,048
lot of characters seem to be husband-and-wife-type
personalities. Are those only a small number of

941
01:09:14,048 --> 01:09:19,286
people, and I'm like, no. I don't make a big deal
of sexuality in the game unless it comes up,

942
01:09:19,286 --> 01:09:23,761
because I don't think it's something that should
drive the story, it just exists in the world. I

943
01:09:23,761 --> 01:09:28,695
think there's relationships of all kinds in
Exandria. And I think culturally, just like in the

944
01:09:28,695 --> 01:09:32,792
real world, some places it's more appropriate than
not, based on wherever they live. It doesn't mean

945
01:09:32,792 --> 01:09:39,525
I agree with that, by any means. I believe love is
love no matter where you find it. And there are

946
01:09:39,525 --> 01:09:44,462
places in Exandria where it is more acceptable
than others. And that's a whole different story

947
01:09:44,462 --> 01:09:46,779
element that might come up depending on where you
travel in the world, I don't know.

948
01:09:46,779 --> 01:09:50,650
LIAM: Hey, guys, we're in Hollywood. We're all
leftie communists. We're good.

949
01:09:50,650 --> 01:09:52,401
ASHLEY: We're all commies.

950
01:09:52,401 --> 01:09:59,941
MATT: But yeah. Like many writers, I err on the
side of creating an interesting character who

951
01:09:59,941 --> 01:10:04,129
might happen to be gay. Or an interesting
character that may happen to be bisexual. I try

952
01:10:04,129 --> 01:10:09,495
not to make that a defining characteristic of the
personality, nor do I want to try and go out of my

953
01:10:09,495 --> 01:10:15,062
way to have a one-off NPC that you encounter be
like, "Oh, by the way, I have a wife and I'm a

954
01:10:15,112 --> 01:10:18,525
"girl." Because that to me seems like it's forced,
it's shoehorned and now it's not about the story,

955
01:10:18,525 --> 01:10:21,589
it's about that relationship, whereas if the
relationship were to come about as part of the

956
01:10:21,589 --> 01:10:23,980
story then that's just how it is, because that's
life.

957
01:10:23,980 --> 01:10:26,955
LIAM: My primary character trait is
heterosexuality, and I mean as Liam.

958
01:10:26,955 --> 01:10:31,188
MATT: (laughs) How high did you roll on your
heterosexual roll when we started your character?

959
01:10:31,188 --> 01:10:32,593
LIAM: Four.

960
01:10:32,593 --> 01:10:38,680
MATT: Good on you! Hey guys, this isn't FATAL.
We're not rolling for vaginal circumference.

961
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:41,124
(sounds of disgust)

962
01:10:41,124 --> 01:10:46,681
MATT: Yeah, there's an RPG that does that. It's
the most misogynist, awful RPG. It's a great

963
01:10:46,681 --> 01:10:50,645
example of how not to develop and design a game if
you haven't seen it, or don't see it, it'll just

964
01:10:50,645 --> 01:10:52,281
make you angry. Don't look up FATAL.

965
01:10:52,281 --> 01:10:54,717
TALIESIN: No. There's places you just don't go on
the internet.

966
01:10:54,717 --> 01:10:59,100
MATT: All right, anyway. We got time for a few
more questions before we take a break and go into

967
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:02,368
the Battle Royale. For those guys who didn't have
your questions answered tonight, I apologize,

968
01:11:02,368 --> 01:11:06,384
we've gotten a lot of questions. I'll try and go
on the Reddit occasionally to answer questions

969
01:11:06,384 --> 01:11:10,483
through this thread in the coming months or so,
off and on, and feel free to throw them back at us

970
01:11:10,483 --> 01:11:12,710
on Twitter afterward. We'll answer them as we can.

971
01:11:12,710 --> 01:11:20,452
MARISHA: Someone was asking for you to explain
where the College of the Maestro came from.

972
01:11:20,452 --> 01:11:28,258
MATT: Oh, College of the Maestro. Yeah, I put up a
College of the Maestro bard college on DMs Guild

973
01:11:28,258 --> 01:11:35,036
recently, and that came from a character-- I may
have mentioned it in previous Q&amp;As. I've never

974
01:11:35,036 --> 01:11:39,035
played a bard, but I've always wanted to. I love
bard classes, I love the aspect behind them. They

975
01:11:39,035 --> 01:11:42,873
were really underappreciated in previous editions,
but I loved the idea of a guy who knows a little

976
01:11:42,873 --> 01:11:48,826
bit about everything and is an inspiration to the
party around him, and so I had this character

977
01:11:48,826 --> 01:11:54,508
concept for a long time to make a bard-- probably
a dwarven bard, because I love dwarves also-- who,

978
01:11:54,508 --> 01:12:00,118
as opposed to playing music or singing music,
could pluck the sound from the air around them.

979
01:12:00,118 --> 01:12:04,907
The sound of battle. The impact of a sword against
a shield, or the sound of a creature chittering as

980
01:12:04,907 --> 01:12:11,112
it attacks, and mold it into a symphony, almost
like a soundbender where they pull and turn it

981
01:12:11,112 --> 01:12:16,467
into music, and that was their basis. So instead
of fighting with a weapon, they have a wand and an

982
01:12:16,467 --> 01:12:19,806
open hand, and they stand in the middle or the
back of the battlefield and conduct it, like an

983
01:12:19,806 --> 01:12:21,111
orchestra conductor.

984
01:12:21,111 --> 01:12:22,200
ASHLEY: That's rad.

985
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:26,425
MATT: Eventually I got really frustrated and was
like, "I'm going to make this as a bard college

986
01:12:26,425 --> 01:12:30,859
"and we'll see if people like it." It's gotten a
good response. It's still being tweaked. Anything

987
01:12:30,859 --> 01:12:35,436
homebrew you try and balance it as best you can. At
first blast, I don't have a lot of time to really

988
01:12:35,436 --> 01:12:39,281
finetune it, and I wanted to get it out there to
get the community response, and it's been really

989
01:12:39,281 --> 01:12:43,646
great. You guys have had great feedback and I'm
tweaking things as we go, so there'll probably be

990
01:12:43,646 --> 01:12:48,008
a couple more updates in the next few weeks or
months. So thank you all, people who have reached

991
01:12:48,008 --> 01:12:54,140
out and given comments on DMs Guild or on the
Reddit thread. It's making its way towards

992
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:57,914
hopefully being a fun option for those who want to
try it out. If you don't like it, you don't have

993
01:12:57,914 --> 01:12:59,220
to play it.

994
01:12:59,220 --> 01:13:06,627
TALIESIN: In my mind I'm imagining Fronk, our
local noise DJ. "I take the sounds, the sounds, I

995
01:13:06,627 --> 01:13:08,889
"put them together, and they make noises."

996
01:13:08,889 --> 01:13:16,245
MATT: Oh my God, please somebody make a College of
the Maestro bard that is a deep noise DJ.

997
01:13:16,245 --> 01:13:19,662
(laughter)

998
01:13:19,662 --> 01:13:29,258
MATT: "I now use my bardic inspiration die to drop
the beat." Dubstep bard. Please, please.

999
01:13:29,258 --> 01:13:34,932
MARISHA: @ChaoticNachos on Twitter asks: "What
shirt are you wearing, Liam?"

1000
01:13:34,932 --> 01:13:39,985
LIAM: Oh, this is a Loot Crate shirt. It's from
one of the last couple of boxes, you can still get

1001
01:13:39,985 --> 01:13:41,549
it. It's alien-involved.

1002
01:13:41,549 --> 01:13:43,639
ASHLEY: This has been one of my favorite shirts
that they've put out.

1003
01:13:43,639 --> 01:13:46,341
MARISHA: This is the X-Files shirt. This is when
X-Files came back.

1004
01:13:46,341 --> 01:13:48,484
ASHLEY: It's so good.

1005
01:13:48,484 --> 01:13:52,412
LIAM: I'm going to answer a super quick one and
then pass one on to Matt that I want to hear the

1006
01:13:52,412 --> 01:13:58,503
answer to. "Why did the twins know Abyssal?" We
learned it in elf school, like Latin. And then

1007
01:13:58,503 --> 01:14:04,775
TukRoll asks: "The vegetables of the virgins is
such a cool story arc, will you release the quest

1008
01:14:04,775 --> 01:14:06,183
"line after this?"

1009
01:14:06,183 --> 01:14:07,516
MATT: Vegetables of the virgins?

1010
01:14:07,516 --> 01:14:08,402
LIAM: Yes.

1011
01:14:08,402 --> 01:14:10,360
(laughter)

1012
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:11,386
ASHLEY: What?

1013
01:14:11,386 --> 01:14:12,663
LIAM: Vestiges of Divergence.

1014
01:14:12,663 --> 01:14:19,165
MATT: The vegetable of the virgins, that's a DVD
set you don't let anyone know you own.

1015
01:14:19,165 --> 01:14:27,769
ASHLEY: I completely misunderstood. The vegetables
of the virgins.

1016
01:14:27,769 --> 01:14:29,695
MATT: We've all made that mistake, right?

1017
01:14:29,695 --> 01:14:34,038
LIAM: Tuk means the Vestiges of Divergence. Are
you going to drop that on the earth?

1018
01:14:34,038 --> 01:14:42,936
MATT: Possibly, a lot of this content right now,
I'm developing as we go and I can't really release

1019
01:14:42,936 --> 01:14:45,277
too much when we're still playing through it.

1020
01:14:45,277 --> 01:14:47,162
LIAM: You know, really, I just wanted to read that
tweet out.

1021
01:14:47,162 --> 01:14:48,172
MATT: You did good.

1022
01:14:48,172 --> 01:14:49,158
ASHLEY: You did great.

1023
01:14:49,158 --> 01:14:52,587
MARISHA: How did I miss that? Is that like a thing
that's been happening, because I missed that.

1024
01:14:52,587 --> 01:14:58,468
MATT: I'm hoping in the future to release elements
of Exandria or elements of the campaign on DMs

1025
01:14:58,468 --> 01:15:02,697
Guild or other means to have you guys play more
in what we've done if it interests you, or to

1026
01:15:02,697 --> 01:15:06,577
take and alter as you like. But time has to fight
itself to me first.

1027
01:15:06,577 --> 01:15:09,133
LIAM: Send you that pocket universe to get inside
of.

1028
01:15:09,133 --> 01:15:18,030
ASHLEY: People do keep asking who Pike is in love
with, and same as what Liam said. We'll see. It

1029
01:15:18,030 --> 01:15:25,069
might not ever happen in game. Maybe it won't. But
she's in love with somebody. It's something that

1030
01:15:25,069 --> 01:15:36,345
happened prior to playing the show. It was a
moment that happened and feelings were formed. It

1031
01:15:36,345 --> 01:15:39,144
might not even be somebody in the group. It could
even be an NPC character.

1032
01:15:39,144 --> 01:15:44,335
LIAM: Trinket. Totally Trinket. It's Trinket.
That's the forbidden love.

1033
01:15:44,335 --> 01:15:48,037
ASHLEY: It's Trinket. It's Trinket. God, you guys!
Figured it out.

1034
01:15:48,037 --> 01:15:54,845
MARISHA: @CmdrDara on Twitter says, "How do I get
my fellow party members to not be murderhobos?"

1035
01:15:54,845 --> 01:15:56,375
LIAM: Good luck.

1036
01:15:56,375 --> 01:16:04,321
MATT: My suggestion is, consider, if your
character is a murderhobo, there are ramifications

1037
01:16:04,392 --> 01:16:09,610
for that type of action in a society. You as a DM,
it's your responsibility to keep in mind, there

1038
01:16:09,610 --> 01:16:14,083
probably-- unless they're in some sort of
destitute place where that's totally fine-- there

1039
01:16:14,083 --> 01:16:17,615
are going to be guards. There are going to be
sentinels. There are going to be people that their

1040
01:16:17,615 --> 01:16:22,741
job is to stop murderhobos from coming in and
being murderhobos. So they will become wanted.

1041
01:16:22,741 --> 01:16:26,455
They will become hunted. There's a possibility
there might be a bounty put on their heads, from

1042
01:16:26,455 --> 01:16:30,998
individuals that are more powerful than the party.
And if they're going to be real dicks about it and

1043
01:16:30,998 --> 01:16:35,023
not try and play the story you've created, and
want to murder everyone, they're probably going to

1044
01:16:35,023 --> 01:16:38,286
end up shot to death in an alley with a bunch of
crossbow bolts and that's the end of their game.

1045
01:16:38,286 --> 01:16:43,274
That's a valuable lesson to learn. If it's a world
which enables a murderhobo-type circumstance,

1046
01:16:43,274 --> 01:16:46,881
that's different, and you can find narratives in
there, but it's definitely more of an evil

1047
01:16:46,881 --> 01:16:51,607
campaign, and a little harder to run unless you
have some experience as a GM. But if it's

1048
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:55,455
something you don't want to happen in the
game, keep in mind, there are ramifications for

1049
01:16:55,455 --> 01:17:01,176
such horrible, murderous actions, which could lead
to a really interesting story. Perhaps they killed

1050
01:17:01,176 --> 01:17:05,956
a few people and they all of a sudden meet the
families of these individuals, or the person that

1051
01:17:05,956 --> 01:17:10,633
captures them is related to someone they murdered,
and decides no, I'm not going to execute you, I'm

1052
01:17:10,633 --> 01:17:15,872
going to make you work for me until you realize
what you've done. Or perhaps a paladin or a cleric

1053
01:17:15,872 --> 01:17:20,421
that actually feels sorry for them is like, "You
did a horrible thing, but I don't understand why

1054
01:17:20,421 --> 01:17:24,475
"you did this. I want to understand it. Until then,
you're under my watch." Now they're working for

1055
01:17:24,475 --> 01:17:29,229
this individual who is trying to understand how
you were so corrupted as people. You can find

1056
01:17:29,229 --> 01:17:33,174
different ways to turn that behavior into part of
the story. But if it's just the players trolling

1057
01:17:33,174 --> 01:17:39,441
you, maybe have a talk with your party to work
with you and respect the time you've put into the game.

1058
01:17:39,441 --> 01:17:44,239
MARISHA: And what happens if your fellow party
members are murderhobos and you're not?

1059
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:52,009
MATT: Then stand up. Stand up in the story and
pull a Keyleth, and be like, "Guys, this is wrong!"

1060
01:17:52,009 --> 01:17:54,584
ASHLEY: #PullAKeyleth.

1061
01:17:54,584 --> 01:17:59,503
MATT: And if they turn around and stab your
character to death? Perhaps this isn't the gaming

1062
01:17:59,503 --> 01:18:01,374
group you should be hanging with.

1063
01:18:01,374 --> 01:18:05,534
LIAM: Maybe your DM could create an all-powerful
hobo lich who could murder them.

1064
01:18:05,534 --> 01:18:08,240
ASHLEY: #PullAKeyleth, except if it's children.

1065
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:11,802
(laughter)

1066
01:18:11,802 --> 01:18:17,295
TALIESIN: Just like in real life, though, you
really have to pick your friends. We've had games

1067
01:18:17,295 --> 01:18:22,617
where not everyone's playing the same game, and it
becomes a problem. I've been in that game several

1068
01:18:22,617 --> 01:18:26,945
times in my life, where there's three different
games happening. Find everybody who wants to play

1069
01:18:26,945 --> 01:18:28,420
the game you want to play.

1070
01:18:28,420 --> 01:18:32,594
MATT: Yeah. And as a GM or DM, before you even
start the game, have a conversation with all your

1071
01:18:32,594 --> 01:18:37,587
players to discuss the kind of game you're all
looking for. Be like, "Hey, guys, this is the kind

1072
01:18:37,587 --> 01:18:42,242
"of game I want to run. And it's got some story,
some intrigue, political elements, and some combat

1073
01:18:42,242 --> 01:18:46,103
"balanced in." Some players may be like, "Oh, I
just want to come in, kick down doors, kill shit

1074
01:18:46,103 --> 01:18:50,455
"and take loot." You want to make sure you all are
agreed upon the type of game you want to play, so

1075
01:18:50,455 --> 01:18:55,781
you don't end up four games in before everyone
hates each other. I will also--

1076
01:18:55,781 --> 01:18:57,448
TALIESIN: I've got one here.

1077
01:18:57,448 --> 01:18:58,352
MATT: Go for it.

1078
01:18:58,352 --> 01:19:03,508
TALIESIN: This one kind of amused me. Stefan
Pennington said, "You said what your characters'

1079
01:19:03,508 --> 01:19:06,744
"greatest flaws were. What do you think your
characters' greatest virtues are?", which I

1080
01:19:06,744 --> 01:19:10,110
thought was funny. We've never talk about what's
good about our characters very often, because

1081
01:19:10,110 --> 01:19:12,726
what's wrong with us is so much more interesting.

1082
01:19:12,726 --> 01:19:13,827
MARISHA: That is true.

1083
01:19:13,827 --> 01:19:26,541
TALIESIN: I know. This is an interesting thought.
Percy I would say is-- he is genuinely filled with

1084
01:19:26,541 --> 01:19:32,218
gratitude towards the people who saved him from
the abyss that he was falling into. He is very

1085
01:19:32,218 --> 01:19:37,565
grateful. He is many, many things, but he is
deeply, deeply grateful for the people in his

1086
01:19:37,565 --> 01:19:41,993
life, and is willing to do some dumb stuff that he
knows is dumb because of it.

1087
01:19:41,993 --> 01:19:44,762
MARISHA: Yeah.

1088
01:19:44,762 --> 01:19:51,879
TALIESIN: I know. I want to hear what I'm going to
be killing in here. Let me know what dies tonight.

1089
01:19:51,879 --> 01:19:58,015
MARISHA: Well, I was going to say, I think Keyleth
has her blind guidance, that I don't think she's

1090
01:19:58,015 --> 01:20:02,868
aware-- like, her positive effect that she has
on Vox Machina, that I don't think

1091
01:20:02,868 --> 01:20:08,034
she's even aware of, that I think she-- because
Keyleth is under the assumption that she's

1092
01:20:08,034 --> 01:20:15,061
constantly ignored and that people are like, not--
No. Right! No, I know!

1093
01:20:15,061 --> 01:20:16,511
LIAM: I feel like she doesn't know that, but--

1094
01:20:16,511 --> 01:20:23,391
MARISHA: I know that, but she's-- I don't think
she realizes the influences that-- I don't think

1095
01:20:23,391 --> 01:20:29,872
she actually realizes the power of her influence
that she actually can wield for the better.

1096
01:20:29,872 --> 01:20:32,456
TALIESIN: I'm so glad that she hasn't learned the
mom voice yet.

1097
01:20:32,456 --> 01:20:35,884
MARISHA: No. Pike gets close.

1098
01:20:35,884 --> 01:20:38,745
TALIESIN: I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed. Oh
my god.

1099
01:20:38,745 --> 01:20:42,384
MARISHA: Pike has gotten close a few times with
Grog, with her-- you're like, one look, man. One

1100
01:20:42,384 --> 01:20:43,588
look, Grog.

1101
01:20:43,588 --> 01:20:47,332
ASHLEY: Yeah, I've got it down to a look instead
of a word. I think that was a moment in game of me

1102
01:20:47,332 --> 01:20:52,702
with Travis being, stop it! Do not die again.

1103
01:20:52,702 --> 01:20:54,159
MATT: That's pretty great.

1104
01:20:54,159 --> 01:20:58,512
LIAM: We're not going to clean this up afterwards,
we're going to cut it off right now!

1105
01:20:58,512 --> 01:21:03,537
ASHLEY: When I watched it back, I was-- when I
watched it back, when I saw the little gif, I was

1106
01:21:03,537 --> 01:21:06,714
like, yikes! I was so intense.

1107
01:21:06,714 --> 01:21:18,364
LIAM: Colin Dorrey @e_jeansegast asks, "Speaking
of Gilmore, is Vax bisexual?" Duh. Good question.

1108
01:21:18,364 --> 01:21:21,640
TALIESIN: Three on the Kinsey scale.

1109
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:27,266
MATT: Oh! We have Zoaga on Reddit asks: "Quick
question for Matt: As we've seen, you've tinkered

1110
01:21:27,266 --> 01:21:30,692
"with the stats of the ancient dragons in the
Conclave. Without going into specific details, do

1111
01:21:30,692 --> 01:21:38,157
"you have any idea what kind of challenge rating
these modifications might put them at?" I don't. I

1112
01:21:38,157 --> 01:21:43,540
try and measure it, but a lot of the measurements
are based on parties of four, maybe five. We have

1113
01:21:43,540 --> 01:21:47,871
a party of seven, sometimes eight people when we
have guests on, and because of the nature of us

1114
01:21:47,871 --> 01:21:53,080
coming from Pathfinder to this game, and I tend to
run games a little higher-power than the average,

1115
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:59,191
I've had to adjust a lot of the difficulty in the
game, which has been an interesting challenge for

1116
01:21:59,191 --> 01:22:04,690
me as a DM, but also means that the scale is going
to continue to get more epic. I have to tweak it,

1117
01:22:04,690 --> 01:22:08,244
because we have a lot of powerful characters with
powerful items, but that's the kind of game I

1118
01:22:08,244 --> 01:22:12,580
wanted to run anyway. The next game might be a
little more low-powered depending on where it

1119
01:22:12,580 --> 01:22:16,613
starts. We shall see. I've learned a lot.
Remember, I came into this -- we went from

1120
01:22:16,613 --> 01:22:19,971
Pathfinder to Fifth Edition when we started the
stream, really our first time playing Fifth

1121
01:22:19,971 --> 01:22:27,931
Edition, so there's been balancing lessons learned
as we progress, and a lot of circumstances that

1122
01:22:27,931 --> 01:22:32,406
caught me and the players off-guard as far as
difficulty. That's part of the fun of the game. So

1123
01:22:32,406 --> 01:22:37,168
for me, it's learning through experience, previous
encounters, learning the players' strengths and

1124
01:22:37,168 --> 01:22:41,123
weaknesses, and finding ways to tweak creatures
that better fit those to be a real challenge when

1125
01:22:41,123 --> 01:22:44,942
it has to be and to not be a real challenge when
it doesn't have to be. Not every battle has to be

1126
01:22:44,942 --> 01:22:50,555
a fight to the death, to the teeth ever, because
sometimes fights are enjoyable for players to show

1127
01:22:50,555 --> 01:22:56,159
up and fight basilisks that once tore them asunder
and be like, oh, we come back and we tear you

1128
01:22:56,159 --> 01:23:01,976
down! It's fun to have those quick victories
sometimes. But yeah, you have to find it through

1129
01:23:01,976 --> 01:23:08,030
practice, and the DMG scaling does help a lot, but
on this level, this size of a party with what they

1130
01:23:08,030 --> 01:23:10,270
have at their disposal, I kind of have to wing a
lot of it.

1131
01:23:10,270 --> 01:23:12,132
LIAM: The Raistlin level.

1132
01:23:12,132 --> 01:23:15,738
ASHLEY: Do we have-- does this go towards
anything, like is this extra credit?

1133
01:23:15,738 --> 01:23:21,932
MATT: What, this? No. There's no experience points
for this. This is for fun. This is just for fun.

1134
01:23:21,932 --> 01:23:25,860
This is for the bragging rights of saying you can
beat the shit out of the rest of your own party.

1135
01:23:25,860 --> 01:23:28,940
LIAM: There's a fun one for me. Someone said,
"What characters do your kids play? Would you ever

1136
01:23:28,940 --> 01:23:34,443
"introduce Vax or Vox Machina into their quests?" I
hadn't thought of that. I'm going to do it. Thank

1137
01:23:34,443 --> 01:23:41,755
you for the suggestion. I started with my son
who's nine. He's with three boys, and my son is a

1138
01:23:41,755 --> 01:23:47,176
half-elf druid with a dragonborn fighter and a
dragonborn rogue. Then my daughter got interested,

1139
01:23:47,176 --> 01:23:50,195
so I started doing a separate game with my
daughter and my son where my son plays a dwarven

1140
01:23:50,195 --> 01:23:55,296
wizard and my daughter plays an elven druid, and
then my daughter got into it, so now I'm doing one

1141
01:23:55,296 --> 01:24:00,227
with four girls where my daughter is a gnome
rogue, and there's a gnome cleric, and there is a

1142
01:24:00,227 --> 01:24:06,609
gnome druid, and a human monk. And I am up to my
neck in Dungeons and Dragons lately, thank you

1143
01:24:06,609 --> 01:24:07,957
Matthew Mercer.

1144
01:24:07,957 --> 01:24:13,975
MATT: (laughs) You're welcome. Someone send him
some Best Dad awards.

1145
01:24:13,975 --> 01:24:21,207
MARISHA: Because Ashley made a Keyleth killing a
child joke, now I got the questions, "Were there

1146
01:24:21,207 --> 01:24:24,874
"ramifications for Keyleth killing the child?"
Yeah.

1147
01:24:24,874 --> 01:24:27,913
TALIESIN: She still has to hear about it all the
time.

1148
01:24:27,913 --> 01:24:37,267
ASHLEY: But it was the-- one of the funniest
moments in the game? It was-- For me, I thought it

1149
01:24:37,267 --> 01:24:44,722
was so funny, which is terrible. Because you were
just doing this amazing thing--

1150
01:24:44,722 --> 01:24:46,523
LIAM: You're all learning a lot about Ashley right
now.

1151
01:24:46,523 --> 01:24:49,821
ASHLEY: I know. I think, if I ever rolled another
character, it would be the most evil, terrible person.

1152
01:24:49,821 --> 01:24:51,304
LIAM: Yeah, I think you have to.

1153
01:24:51,304 --> 01:24:59,210
ASHLEY: For me, I thought it was kind of funny
because you were like, I just want to help! And

1154
01:24:59,210 --> 01:25:01,351
then he was like, and you killed a child.

1155
01:25:01,351 --> 01:25:05,910
LIAM: You know, it's not real. You know, it's
paper and dice.

1156
01:25:05,910 --> 01:25:11,004
TALIESIN: And it's really hard to find a greeting
card for that. Like, I've been looking for years

1157
01:25:11,004 --> 01:25:13,431
to find a pop-up-- snap!

1158
01:25:13,431 --> 01:25:16,070
MARISHA: Hey, sorry you killed a child. Oh god, oh
god!

1159
01:25:16,070 --> 01:25:17,677
MATT: That's horrible, that's horrible!

1160
01:25:17,677 --> 01:25:19,044
LIAM: A musical card?

1161
01:25:19,044 --> 01:25:27,081
ASHLEY: It was up there with the moment Scanlan
had the knife ready to go and then he kept going

1162
01:25:27,081 --> 01:25:28,204
out the window.

1163
01:25:28,204 --> 01:25:29,470
TALIESIN: Yeah, that was so amazing.

1164
01:25:29,470 --> 01:25:34,061
MARISHA: Well, I pretty much did the same thing,
too, when I accidentally killed the half-dead

1165
01:25:34,061 --> 01:25:37,816
dwarf as Minxie by picking him up by the neck when
we were in the Underdark.

1166
01:25:37,816 --> 01:25:39,032
ASHLEY: By his scruff?

1167
01:25:39,032 --> 01:25:43,573
MARISHA: Yeah, I picked him up by the scruff and
he had one hit point left. It was just enough.

1168
01:25:43,573 --> 01:25:45,070
MATT: Like, snap. Ooh.

1169
01:25:45,070 --> 01:25:49,453
MARISHA: That was where the "I try so hard and I'm
the worst" came from.

1170
01:25:49,453 --> 01:25:54,389
ASHLEY: You have had so many of those moments and
those are some of the best moments. You've had so

1171
01:25:54,389 --> 01:25:58,455
many of those where you're like, guys, I got this.
I'm here to help.

1172
01:25:58,455 --> 01:26:00,140
MARISHA: Yeah, Keyleth's the worst. She's--

1173
01:26:00,140 --> 01:26:01,445
ASHLEY: No, she's the best.

1174
01:26:01,445 --> 01:26:05,318
MATT: The reactionary push into the lava's one of
my favorites. She's like, "I don't know what to

1175
01:26:05,318 --> 01:26:14,192
"do! I'm sorry!" Just pushing him down into the lava
as he's like (screaming). "I'm sorry!" That was so funny.

1176
01:26:14,192 --> 01:26:21,754
MARISHA: Go to sleep. Go to sleep. It'll be over
soon.

1177
01:26:21,754 --> 01:26:24,186
(laughter)

1178
01:26:24,186 --> 01:26:27,317
LIAM: On the flip side, one of our home moments
was amazing-- it's actually on my vine account--

1179
01:26:27,317 --> 01:26:31,642
which was Keyleth walking up to a shambling mound?
Was it a shambling mound?

1180
01:26:31,642 --> 01:26:33,237
MATT: It was a corrupt treant.

1181
01:26:33,237 --> 01:26:36,548
LIAM: A corrupt treant. We were going to have to
fight that thing and you went (blugh) and it went

1182
01:26:36,548 --> 01:26:39,940
(groaning) and wandered off and we were all like
(yelling).

1183
01:26:39,940 --> 01:26:41,431
MARISHA: No, it was great.

1184
01:26:41,431 --> 01:26:44,347
MATT: I can't remember what spell it was, but it
was something that essentially you can charm a

1185
01:26:44,347 --> 01:26:49,374
specific plant-based monster, and it failed its
saving throw. It was going to be this epic

1186
01:26:49,374 --> 01:26:51,938
encounter with this giant corrupted treant in the
middle of the Bramble Forest.

1187
01:26:51,938 --> 01:26:54,497
MARISHA: It was Dominate Plants. During Pathfinder
days.

1188
01:26:54,497 --> 01:26:58,808
MATT: Yeah. It was this big old bramble forest
that led up to the actual home of the Dread

1189
01:26:58,808 --> 01:27:04,036
Emperor and it walked out and was like (roars) and
you're like, "Sit down and sleep." "Okay." And

1190
01:27:04,036 --> 01:27:05,850
that was it and I was like, well done.

1191
01:27:05,850 --> 01:27:13,972
MARISHA: You know, I like-- believing in the what
I like to call the Community zodiac, as in Dan

1192
01:27:13,972 --> 01:27:22,391
Harmon's Community, and Keyleth is definitely the
Britta of the Community zodiac. She's Britta.

1193
01:27:22,391 --> 01:27:23,957
MATT: I like that.

1194
01:27:23,957 --> 01:27:25,511
TALIESIN: No, yeah. I totally see that.

1195
01:27:25,511 --> 01:27:27,703
LIAM: What you got under that blanket?

1196
01:27:27,703 --> 01:27:30,687
MATT: Well, we'll find out here shortly. Let's do
one more question and then we're going to take a

1197
01:27:30,687 --> 01:27:32,039
break and come back here for the Battle Royale.

1198
01:27:32,039 --> 01:27:33,060
MARISHA: Make it a good one!

1199
01:27:33,060 --> 01:27:35,339
MATT: I know! I'm trying to see. Let's go for the
chat. We've done a lot of these. Chat, let's see

1200
01:27:35,339 --> 01:27:36,790
what we got. This'll be our last question for the
night.

1201
01:27:36,790 --> 01:27:44,518
MARISHA: Keyleth is totally Britta. See?

1202
01:27:44,518 --> 01:27:47,574
LIAM: Unless that is a hedge maze, I am a dead
man.

1203
01:27:47,574 --> 01:27:49,788
TALIESIN: That's another thing. I think we need
Community fanart.

1204
01:27:49,788 --> 01:27:53,415
MARISHA: Community fanart? Crossover Community
fanart?

1205
01:27:53,415 --> 01:27:59,570
MATT: Chat is going so fast. It's going so fast,
oh my god!

1206
01:27:59,570 --> 01:28:02,039
LIAM: If that's a big room, I'm gone.

1207
01:28:02,039 --> 01:28:04,102
ASHLEY: That is not true.

1208
01:28:04,102 --> 01:28:07,579
MATT: This is a quick throwaway. It won't be the
last one. Someone asked if I could ever join Vox

1209
01:28:07,579 --> 01:28:11,829
Machina, what class and race would I be? Dwarf
bard. I think I've already specified that.

1210
01:28:11,829 --> 01:28:13,489
TALIESIN: That's pretty good.

1211
01:28:13,489 --> 01:28:18,947
MATT: A good final end question.

1212
01:28:18,947 --> 01:28:23,518
MARISHA: Someone said, "What's worse, doors or
dragons?" That's a pretty good question.

1213
01:28:23,518 --> 01:28:26,701
MATT: We'll find out. (laughs) We'll find out.

1214
01:28:26,701 --> 01:28:31,435
LIAM: Can't read that stuff.

1215
01:28:31,435 --> 01:28:34,762
MATT: I know, it's going so fast. It's okay. I'm
glad you guys are so excited to ask questions, but

1216
01:28:34,762 --> 01:28:35,909
I can't.

1217
01:28:35,909 --> 01:28:36,877
TALIESIN: Wow, it's like--

1218
01:28:36,877 --> 01:28:38,948
MATT: It's like looking into the abyss.

1219
01:28:38,948 --> 01:28:41,171
MARISHA: Yeah, this is about the time where I'm
like, do I need glasses?

1220
01:28:41,171 --> 01:28:43,010
TALIESIN: It's going to be three minutes of us
staring at the--

1221
01:28:43,010 --> 01:28:44,419
MATT: I can see through time.

1222
01:28:44,419 --> 01:28:52,578
LIAM: Somebody asked-- here's a big question. I
didn't see it on there, but somebody asked which

1223
01:28:52,578 --> 01:28:56,391
character dying would have the biggest overall
effect on the group?

1224
01:28:56,391 --> 01:29:00,571
MATT: I don't want to answer that, because then
it's going to subconsciously make me feel really

1225
01:29:00,571 --> 01:29:02,817
awful if they die. I don't want to answer that.

1226
01:29:02,817 --> 01:29:04,147
LIAM: Never mind. Bad idea.

1227
01:29:04,147 --> 01:29:05,770
MATT: I don't want that to happen. Interesting
idea.

1228
01:29:05,770 --> 01:29:06,919
ASHLEY: Do you have someone in your head, though?

1229
01:29:06,919 --> 01:29:09,249
MATT: No, I don't. I don't want that in my head. I
don't want any of that in my head. If it happens,

1230
01:29:09,249 --> 01:29:10,190
it happens.

1231
01:29:10,190 --> 01:29:11,965
LIAM: Forget it. What are the dimensions of the
cube?

1232
01:29:11,965 --> 01:29:14,806
MATT: The dimensions of the cube? (laughs) Sam's
cube?

1233
01:29:14,806 --> 01:29:15,925
LIAM: That's one by one.

1234
01:29:15,925 --> 01:29:18,562
ASHLEY: Forget it. Just how do we kill the dragon,
and then we'll stop.

1235
01:29:18,562 --> 01:29:21,614
MARISHA: Yeah. Someone asked if Umbrasyl was
suicidally depressed yet.

1236
01:29:21,614 --> 01:29:26,032
MATT: Who's the Hodor of the group? Oh. We're not
going to talk about that. Also, spoilers.

1237
01:29:26,032 --> 01:29:28,089
TALIESIN: Spoilers! God, some of us haven't had
time.

1238
01:29:28,089 --> 01:29:29,421
ASHLEY: Have you watched it?

1239
01:29:29,421 --> 01:29:31,026
TALIESIN: I haven't even started this season yet.

1240
01:29:31,026 --> 01:29:33,911
MATT: Hodor has an amazing moment.

1241
01:29:33,911 --> 01:29:36,357
TALIESIN: I've heard. The internet told me.

1242
01:29:36,357 --> 01:29:42,429
MATT: Hush. It's awesome. Have you ever regretted
a decision you made, either in character or while

1243
01:29:42,429 --> 01:29:44,903
DMing? We'll have this as our final question for
the evening.

1244
01:29:44,903 --> 01:29:49,668
MARISHA: Regretted a decision in character or
while DMing?

1245
01:29:49,668 --> 01:29:51,022
LIAM: I got mine ready to go.

1246
01:29:51,022 --> 01:29:51,877
MARISHA: Go.

1247
01:29:51,877 --> 01:29:55,304
LIAM: Using my Cape of the Mountebank for the
first time to teleport to the other side of the

1248
01:29:55,304 --> 01:30:04,479
glass and save everybody! (clunk) Oh fuck. It was
like, my stomach just went--

1249
01:30:04,479 --> 01:30:08,525
MATT: That was going to be their turn, leave, and
hit the button as they left circumstance, and you

1250
01:30:08,525 --> 01:30:11,220
went right there and hit it. I'm like, well, that
saves them the problem of it.

1251
01:30:11,220 --> 01:30:15,711
LIAM: Thought it was the door opener. Nope. That's
all right. It was a great moment.

1252
01:30:15,711 --> 01:30:18,468
MATT: It was a great moment, but didn't quite work
how you thought.

1253
01:30:18,468 --> 01:30:20,473
LIAM: Whoops! Still alive for one more week.

1254
01:30:20,473 --> 01:30:22,098
MATT: How about you guys?

1255
01:30:22,098 --> 01:30:26,714
TALIESIN: The treasure chest, by far. If I had
killed Vex, I would have felt really, really

1256
01:30:26,714 --> 01:30:33,535
terrible. Actually, weirdly, more out-of-character
than in-character. I would have felt really awful

1257
01:30:33,535 --> 01:30:41,914
because that's such a fourth-grade mistake.
Really, junior-high-level foolishness.

1258
01:30:41,914 --> 01:30:44,698
MATT: That's okay. Anything with you guys?

1259
01:30:44,698 --> 01:30:46,243
MARISHA: So many.

1260
01:30:46,243 --> 01:30:49,846
ASHLEY: Man, there's so many. There's so many
little ones where I'm like (groans).

1261
01:30:49,846 --> 01:30:52,534
MARISHA: I know. All the time.

1262
01:30:52,534 --> 01:30:54,077
LIAM: Death by a thousand cuts?

1263
01:30:54,077 --> 01:31:05,301
MARISHA: Yeah. Oh no. Fuck you, Kilgrave. Well, I
get angry at Keyleth sometimes for not being more

1264
01:31:05,301 --> 01:31:10,485
assertive. And then there's some times that I want
to say things as Marisha for Keyleth, but I'm

1265
01:31:10,485 --> 01:31:17,660
like, no, she wouldn't. She would be bowled over
right now and she would go with it. So there's

1266
01:31:17,660 --> 01:31:22,848
several times where I'm like, (inhale) fuck! Why
couldn't you speak up? And then there's some times

1267
01:31:22,848 --> 01:31:28,020
where the game moves faster than we can keep up
with it, and sometimes you're like, I want this to

1268
01:31:28,020 --> 01:31:31,734
happen. God, there have been three separate times
where I've wanted to come knock on your door and

1269
01:31:31,734 --> 01:31:33,548
it (snaps) the game rolls past it.

1270
01:31:33,548 --> 01:31:38,194
LIAM: It's a lot of theater etiquette and improv.
It's like, you're like, I'm going to, oh no,

1271
01:31:38,194 --> 01:31:41,148
they're having a moment. And then you kind of
forget it, or the moment passes and you got to let

1272
01:31:41,148 --> 01:31:42,144
it go.

1273
01:31:42,144 --> 01:31:47,531
MARISHA: Yeah, theater etiquette. I remember, and
the audience noticed it, and they were like, if

1274
01:31:47,531 --> 01:31:53,707
they don't come back to this moment-- I came over,
and I sat down and I said-- we were in a tavern,

1275
01:31:53,707 --> 01:31:57,675
and I said Keyleth puts her head on Vax. She leans
her head on Vax.

1276
01:31:57,675 --> 01:32:00,833
LIAM: Right, and what I was thinking was,
Gilmore's over there, and he's looking at this.

1277
01:32:00,833 --> 01:32:02,259
MARISHA: And then Gilmore walked in.

1278
01:32:02,259 --> 01:32:04,203
LIAM: He's looking at this and I can't explain
this.

1279
01:32:04,203 --> 01:32:10,987
MARISHA: No, it was literally like a fucking bar
scenario. I was like, "Oh, there's Gilmore. Got to go."

1280
01:32:10,987 --> 01:32:13,447
(laughter)

1281
01:32:13,447 --> 01:32:15,466
TALIESIN: That whole bar episode was great.

1282
01:32:15,466 --> 01:32:18,001
ASHLEY: I love that bar episode so much.

1283
01:32:18,001 --> 01:32:22,159
TALIESIN: Yeah, I want to yell at Percy all the
time. He does dumb shit a lot and I'm like, I got

1284
01:32:22,159 --> 01:32:23,600
to let it happen.

1285
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:26,664
LIAM: Vax and Keyleth really like each other, but
this is them.

1286
01:32:26,664 --> 01:32:30,154
MARISHA: Yeah, can't sync up. Cannot.

1287
01:32:30,154 --> 01:32:31,805
MATT: Ross and Rachel.

1288
01:32:31,805 --> 01:32:34,489
TALIESIN: Did you just say that? Oh my god.

1289
01:32:34,489 --> 01:32:38,065
MARISHA: So much Ross and Rachel. Oh my god. So
Ross and Rachel.

1290
01:32:38,065 --> 01:32:39,710
MATT: That's my biggest regret as a DM was saying
that right there.

1291
01:32:39,710 --> 01:32:43,159
(laughter)

1292
01:32:43,159 --> 01:32:48,975
MATT: No, I can't say I have any regrets as a DM
story-wise because I let you guys guide so much of

1293
01:32:48,975 --> 01:32:53,351
it. I build stuff and let it happen and I'm
usually happy with things, how they turn out,

1294
01:32:53,351 --> 01:32:57,067
whether or not I planned on it or not. That to me
is what's fascinating and interesting and fun as a

1295
01:32:57,067 --> 01:33:03,789
DM is being caught off-guard and having to justify
and work with it on a constant improv level. I may

1296
01:33:03,789 --> 01:33:08,594
have regrets mechanically. I might forget elements
in battle or might be circumstances that happen.

1297
01:33:08,594 --> 01:33:13,881
For instance, when Gilmore came in and gave you
guys the Heroes' Feast, not thinking at the time,

1298
01:33:13,881 --> 01:33:17,766
it set you up for a battle with a purple worm and
essentially disabled its most dangerous element:

1299
01:33:17,766 --> 01:33:22,212
its tail poison. I didn't realize it at the time
because it just organically happened. But I'm not

1300
01:33:22,212 --> 01:33:26,589
going to try and hold that back or restrain it in
the moment. It happened to work out to be in your

1301
01:33:26,589 --> 01:33:31,091
favor, and that's how it works sometimes. I just
let it happen. So I wouldn't say I really have any

1302
01:33:31,091 --> 01:33:36,744
regrets. Not because I'm too good for them, just
because I let things happen, and I appreciate it

1303
01:33:36,744 --> 01:33:39,902
for the good and the bad that comes with it and
let the story guide itself.

1304
01:33:39,902 --> 01:33:41,765
LIAM: We entertain ourselves.

1305
01:33:41,765 --> 01:33:46,236
MATT: I hope so. (laughs) The moment that stops,
we need to stop doing this.

1306
01:33:46,236 --> 01:33:50,484
MARISHA: Oh, and to Greg who says Keyleth probably
regrets not reading her spells, and I'm going to

1307
01:33:50,484 --> 01:33:55,303
join Ashley and speak for you, even though you're
not asking for it. We have a lot of fucking

1308
01:33:55,303 --> 01:33:56,472
spells, man!

1309
01:33:56,472 --> 01:33:59,834
ASHLEY: So many spells! It's so hard to keep track
in the moment when you're stressed!

1310
01:33:59,834 --> 01:34:01,436
MARISHA: You're so stressed!

1311
01:34:01,436 --> 01:34:04,613
TALIESIN: And you'll turn to me and be like, am I
reading this right? And I'll go, oh yeah. And then

1312
01:34:04,613 --> 01:34:06,554
a thing will happen like whoa!

1313
01:34:06,554 --> 01:34:12,091
ASHLEY: That's happened so many times where you're
like, and I'll show it to Laura or Travis and be

1314
01:34:12,091 --> 01:34:13,382
like, is this right?

1315
01:34:13,382 --> 01:34:15,669
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah, no, this is going to be
fine.

1316
01:34:15,669 --> 01:34:24,306
MARISHA: Well, and people don't understand either,
along with DM rule-bending, we don't necessarily

1317
01:34:24,306 --> 01:34:32,048
know how you're going to interpret the spell.
There's a ton of things like Mist Form that I

1318
01:34:32,048 --> 01:34:37,384
didn't know how it was going to act in the moment
and it didn't mean I didn't read it. I read all of

1319
01:34:37,384 --> 01:34:43,446
my spells hundreds of times. I have hundreds. I
have hundreds, and I've read all of them and I

1320
01:34:43,446 --> 01:34:48,109
will try them in the moment and sometimes they'll
work in my favor and sometimes they won't. I don't

1321
01:34:48,109 --> 01:34:49,419
always know.

1322
01:34:49,419 --> 01:34:54,439
MATT: Which is fine. A big part of D&amp;D is fucking
up. That's just how it is. In any good game

1323
01:34:54,439 --> 01:34:56,806
there's going to be fuck-ups. We just roll with
it.

1324
01:34:56,806 --> 01:34:58,401
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1325
01:34:58,401 --> 01:35:00,146
LIAM: It's not appellate law.

1326
01:35:00,146 --> 01:35:04,538
MATT: Yeah. Well, guys, we're going to come back
here in a few minutes and do our Battle Royale.

1327
01:35:04,538 --> 01:35:07,838
We're going to go ahead and get you guys to use
the restroom and get ready, get your characters--

1328
01:35:07,838 --> 01:35:09,488
We've leveled everybody up--

1329
01:35:09,488 --> 01:35:11,562
(fierce growls, laughter)

1330
01:35:11,562 --> 01:35:14,096
MATT: --for the purposes of this fight, everyone's
been leveled up to a baseline level 14, so

1331
01:35:14,096 --> 01:35:15,468
everyone's at an even scope.

1332
01:35:15,468 --> 01:35:16,705
ASHLEY: Because I'm behind.

1333
01:35:16,705 --> 01:35:17,783
TALIESIN: I'm behind.

1334
01:35:17,783 --> 01:35:19,105
ASHLEY: Oh, okay, okay, okay.

1335
01:35:19,105 --> 01:35:24,282
MATT: So let's go ahead and take a break. We'll be
back here in a few minutes and we'll see which

1336
01:35:24,282 --> 01:35:27,077
member of Vox Machina in this battle will stand
supreme.

1337
01:35:27,077 --> 01:35:30,017
LIAM: The answer is "not me."

1338
01:35:30,017 --> 01:48:28,659
[break]

1339
01:48:28,729 --> 01:48:34,156
MATT: Welcome back, everybody. We're about to
jump here in the Battle Royale. We wanted to let

1340
01:48:34,156 --> 01:48:40,142
you guys know as part of our final week of the
Loot Crate sponsorship. Their June theme is

1341
01:48:40,142 --> 01:48:41,337
dystopia.

1342
01:48:41,337 --> 01:48:42,709
MARISHA: Is it really?

1343
01:48:42,709 --> 01:48:44,084
MATT: Yeah, it's dystopia, which is cool.

1344
01:48:44,084 --> 01:48:46,205
ASHLEY: That sounds awesome!

1345
01:48:46,205 --> 01:48:50,970
MATT: It's going to feature RoboCop, Terminator 3,
Matrix. It involves Fallout 4 and Bioshock

1346
01:48:50,970 --> 01:48:53,448
Infinite stuff.

1347
01:48:53,521 --> 01:48:55,239
MARISHA: Wait, did you say Matrix?

1348
01:48:55,239 --> 01:48:56,359
MATT: Yes.

1349
01:48:56,359 --> 01:48:57,498
ASHLEY: Wow.

1350
01:48:57,498 --> 01:49:00,851
MARISHA: I haven't heard that in a while.

1351
01:49:00,851 --> 01:49:04,192
TALIESIN: No, the world that created the Matrix
film is a desolate, sad place.

1352
01:49:04,192 --> 01:49:09,601
MATT: (laughter) Compared to the sequels, yeah. In
order to get this crate, you have to sign up by

1353
01:49:09,601 --> 01:49:15,953
the 19th at 9:00 PM Pacific to be able to get the
dystopian crate when it goes out. But once again,

1354
01:49:15,953 --> 01:49:19,928
you can get three dollars off your subscription by
going to lootcrate.com/criticalrole and enter

1355
01:49:19,928 --> 01:49:25,901
criticalrole as your code, one word, criticalrole.
I was really happy when they printed the Pip-Boy

1356
01:49:25,901 --> 01:49:29,279
statue. Marisha's going to get her dice.

1357
01:49:29,279 --> 01:49:31,971
MARISHA: Are these mine? Yeah--

1358
01:49:31,971 --> 01:49:37,728
MATT: There you go. All right, so welcome back as
we kick into--

1359
01:49:37,728 --> 01:49:41,288
(dramatic music)

1360
01:49:41,288 --> 01:49:43,056
MARISHA: Oh my god, you guys.

1361
01:49:43,056 --> 01:49:52,936
MATT: So. Suddenly, a flash of white takes your
vision, and as the white fades, you see, at the end

1362
01:49:52,936 --> 01:50:03,727
of a long, blue sky-like tunnel, a man standing,
dark, curly, almost permed hair, a suit with a

1363
01:50:03,727 --> 01:50:12,436
white, wide polyester lapel, white track pants,
and white shoes. He approaches, his chest almost

1364
01:50:12,436 --> 01:50:17,809
visible. He speaks with you with confidence, the
voice of God, the voice of everything. He goes

1365
01:50:17,809 --> 01:50:22,186
"Hello, Vox Machina, I am the Beyonder."

1366
01:50:22,186 --> 01:50:24,899
(laughter)

1367
01:50:24,899 --> 01:50:28,723
MATT: "And I have decided for fun, I wanted to see
which one of you guys could fight. I did this

1368
01:50:28,723 --> 01:50:35,009
"thing once with a bunch of heroes and it got
crazy, so I am scaling it down. You four, let's

1369
01:50:35,009 --> 01:50:39,260
"see who beats the crap out of the others, shall
we?" He snaps his fingers and with that, it

1370
01:50:39,260 --> 01:50:46,355
flashes to black and the air around you gets
hotter and hotter. You feel yourself sweating in

1371
01:50:46,355 --> 01:50:51,732
darkness and suddenly, your vision comes to you
and you see before you a landscape of molten rock

1372
01:50:51,732 --> 01:50:53,889
and lava.

1373
01:50:53,889 --> 01:50:58,226
TALIESIN: Is that actually your Beyonder voice if
it ever happens?

1374
01:50:58,226 --> 01:51:05,389
MATT: That's exactly how I think a Beyonder would
sound if he were to show up in an event. So, that

1375
01:51:05,389 --> 01:51:11,473
being the case, ladies and gentlemen, let's go
ahead and roll initiative.

1376
01:51:11,473 --> 01:51:13,400
(groans)

1377
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:15,094
ASHLEY: What?!

1378
01:51:15,094 --> 01:51:17,101
MARISHA: Where am I?

1379
01:51:17,101 --> 01:51:18,501
MATT: You're right there.

1380
01:51:18,501 --> 01:51:22,285
ASHLEY and MARISHA: This is ridiculous.

1381
01:51:22,285 --> 01:51:23,611
LIAM: I'm using a luck right now.

1382
01:51:23,611 --> 01:51:25,549
MARISHA: Already? So soon.

1383
01:51:25,549 --> 01:51:37,931
MATT: Roll initiative, guys.

1384
01:51:37,931 --> 01:51:40,458
MARISHA: 18.

1385
01:51:40,458 --> 01:51:41,820
MATT: All right, Ashley?

1386
01:51:41,820 --> 01:51:42,813
ASHLEY: Seven

1387
01:51:42,813 --> 01:51:48,421
MATT: Okay, so a total of seven. We have 25-20?
20-15?

1388
01:51:48,421 --> 01:51:49,742
TALIESIN: 17.

1389
01:51:49,742 --> 01:51:51,334
LIAM and MARISHA: 18.

1390
01:51:51,334 --> 01:51:54,644
LIAM: (singing) I got you, babe.

1391
01:51:54,644 --> 01:51:57,449
(laughter)

1392
01:51:57,449 --> 01:52:02,289
MATT: All right, to see which of you goes first, I
am going to have you guys both roll off again for

1393
01:52:02,289 --> 01:52:03,547
initiative.

1394
01:52:03,547 --> 01:52:04,635
LIAM: 20 again?

1395
01:52:04,635 --> 01:52:06,249
MATT: 20 again, both of you.

1396
01:52:06,249 --> 01:52:09,201
MARISHA: (groans) Natural one.

1397
01:52:09,201 --> 01:52:10,446
LIAM: Four.

1398
01:52:10,446 --> 01:52:12,118
(laughter)

1399
01:52:12,118 --> 01:52:21,406
MATT: All right, so Vax is going slightly before
Keyleth, then Percy, then we have Pike. All

1400
01:52:21,406 --> 01:52:25,372
righty, so first round is Vax's. Vax, what are you
going to do?

1401
01:52:25,372 --> 01:52:32,298
LIAM: Holy crap. Okay, with the assassin feature,
I have advantage now because I'm going first. I'm

1402
01:52:32,298 --> 01:52:36,500
going to throw a dagger right at Percy's head. Am
I within 60 feet?

1403
01:52:36,500 --> 01:52:38,876
MATT: You are, yes. (counting)

1404
01:52:38,876 --> 01:52:40,588
ASHLEY: Right out of the motherfucking gate.

1405
01:52:40,588 --> 01:52:42,139
TALIESIN: Do you have my sword or do you not have
my sword right now?

1406
01:52:42,139 --> 01:52:43,343
MATT: Yes, he is within 50 feet.

1407
01:52:43,343 --> 01:52:45,084
LIAM: This is our basic stuff. Even if I had it,
I'm not using that.

1408
01:52:45,084 --> 01:52:46,926
MATT: Yeah, this is basic weapons.

1409
01:52:46,926 --> 01:52:52,569
LIAM: Oh good, that's a 29.

1410
01:52:52,569 --> 01:52:54,290
MATT: What's your AC, Percy?

1411
01:52:54,290 --> 01:53:07,063
TALIESIN: My AC is 18, but I'm going to try and
use the gloves of missile snaring. That brings it

1412
01:53:07,063 --> 01:53:08,467
to a--

1413
01:53:08,467 --> 01:53:11,679
MATT: The damage of it, at least. Let him roll
damage first.

1414
01:53:11,679 --> 01:53:13,102
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, roll damage. That hits.

1415
01:53:13,102 --> 01:53:40,708
LIAM: (counting) 39, and this is the dagger of
venom, and I want him to roll versus poison.

1416
01:53:40,708 --> 01:53:45,350
MATT: So 39 damage, and you want to do your gloves
of missile snaring?

1417
01:53:45,350 --> 01:53:49,389
TALIESIN: I'll do my 39 damage right now. I didn't
roll the right die.

1418
01:53:49,389 --> 01:53:50,611
MATT: Set it aside.

1419
01:53:50,611 --> 01:53:56,074
TALIESIN: That's 13 points off that, so that's--

1420
01:53:56,074 --> 01:53:58,169
LIAM: How does that work?

1421
01:53:58,169 --> 01:54:01,675
MATT: He basically grabs your dagger out of the
air and stops some of the damage before it strikes.

1422
01:54:01,675 --> 01:54:03,239
LIAM: Automatically, or does he have to succeed to
do it?

1423
01:54:03,239 --> 01:54:07,531
MATT: No, it just lowers the damage.

1424
01:54:07,531 --> 01:54:11,060
TALIESIN: That's 13 points off that, so that's--

1425
01:54:11,060 --> 01:54:16,869
MATT: 26 damage you take, piercing damage. And I
need you to go ahead and make-- is it a

1426
01:54:16,869 --> 01:54:18,128
constitution saving throw?

1427
01:54:18,128 --> 01:54:19,618
LIAM: Yes, 15 is the DC.

1428
01:54:19,618 --> 01:54:23,531
TALIESIN: Constitution saving throw. That's a d20,
right?

1429
01:54:23,531 --> 01:54:25,296
MATT: Yes, it is.

1430
01:54:25,296 --> 01:54:26,992
TALIESIN: Yep.

1431
01:54:26,992 --> 01:54:28,343
MATT: It succeeds.

1432
01:54:28,343 --> 01:54:29,434
LIAM: Okay.

1433
01:54:29,434 --> 01:54:34,273
MATT: What are you doing, Vax?

1434
01:54:34,273 --> 01:54:40,047
LIAM: Now, quick question, Matt. If I were to
attack him three times in a row, right? The next

1435
01:54:40,047 --> 01:54:43,921
two get no sneak attack, I know that. If I move to
another target, do they get sneak attack or no in

1436
01:54:43,921 --> 01:54:45,181
this instance?

1437
01:54:45,181 --> 01:54:46,584
MATT: No, you only get to sneak attack once per
round.

1438
01:54:46,584 --> 01:54:47,690
LIAM: One time per round.

1439
01:54:47,690 --> 01:54:50,055
MATT: Correct, and remember, you have not activated
your boots yet.

1440
01:54:50,055 --> 01:54:51,348
LIAM: I click them now.

1441
01:54:51,348 --> 01:54:54,536
MATT: Okay. (laughter)

1442
01:54:54,536 --> 01:54:56,149
LIAM: Thanks, buddy.

1443
01:54:56,149 --> 01:54:59,030
MATT: Looking at the item real fast, too. Is there
an activation cost for the boots?

1444
01:54:59,030 --> 01:55:00,778
LIAM: Boots of haste, Laura has that piece of
paper.

1445
01:55:00,778 --> 01:55:05,981
MATT: Oh right. We will say for the purposes, it
would be a bonus action to activate it.

1446
01:55:05,981 --> 01:55:21,664
LIAM: What's the lighting like in here? There's
the light from--

1447
01:55:21,664 --> 01:55:30,176
MATT: This whole room is low light. It is just the
glow from the lava in here. Since a number of

1448
01:55:30,176 --> 01:55:37,175
you have darkvision, it's not a huge deal within
60 feet, but it is considered technically low light.

1449
01:55:37,175 --> 01:55:51,851
LIAM: Okay, I'm going to use my action to go
stealth. That's action, action, bonus action.

1450
01:55:51,851 --> 01:55:55,520
You're saying the boots-- I don't think I have
ever used a bonus action before when clicking the

1451
01:55:55,520 --> 01:56:01,212
boots, so we need to change things from here on
out. You've never called me on it in 50 games.

1452
01:56:01,212 --> 01:56:03,618
MATT: Right, usually it was the first round that
you did it, but it's fine.

1453
01:56:03,618 --> 01:56:19,823
LIAM: Okay, then with your permission, I am going
to use my-- I am going to throw another dagger. I

1454
01:56:19,823 --> 01:56:29,534
totally miss and I am going to let it go. It was a
one. I am going to step past that wall there, I

1455
01:56:29,534 --> 01:56:31,035
can do it myself.

1456
01:56:31,035 --> 01:56:33,305
MATT: You can! You can reach out and actually
change things as you are.

1457
01:56:33,305 --> 01:56:46,779
LIAM: Okay, I'm hasted so I get double speed.
As soon as I'm there-- (whispering)

1458
01:56:46,779 --> 01:56:49,061
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll a stealth check.

1459
01:56:49,061 --> 01:56:52,359
MARISHA, TALIESIN, and ASHLEY: (singing) Secrets!

1460
01:56:52,359 --> 01:57:01,669
MARISHA: Second luck down already. Damn.

1461
01:57:01,669 --> 01:57:12,209
MATT: All right, I need Keyleth and Percy to roll
perception checks.

1462
01:57:12,209 --> 01:57:14,414
MARISHA: 29.

1463
01:57:14,414 --> 01:57:15,761
TALIESIN: 11.

1464
01:57:15,761 --> 01:57:21,731
MATT: Okay, you guys both-- actually, all three of
you watch as Vax turns behind the corner and

1465
01:57:21,731 --> 01:57:27,209
vanishes from sight. You have no idea where he is.
You know he is somewhere in this area, but that's

1466
01:57:27,209 --> 01:57:28,615
all you know.

1467
01:57:28,615 --> 01:57:31,517
MARISHA: (groans) Every damn time.

1468
01:57:31,517 --> 01:57:33,487
(laughter)

1469
01:57:33,487 --> 01:57:35,168
MATT: That is the end of your turn. Keyleth,
you're up.

1470
01:57:35,168 --> 01:57:41,817
MARISHA: All right, so bonus action is different
than a free action, right?

1471
01:57:41,817 --> 01:57:43,092
MATT: Yeah.

1472
01:57:43,092 --> 01:57:56,650
MARISHA: Okay. As my action, I am going to cast
Sunbeam.

1473
01:57:56,650 --> 01:57:59,087
MATT: Okay.

1474
01:57:59,087 --> 01:58:08,671
MARISHA: And I guess since Percy's the one in my
line of sight, I am going to be beaming it right

1475
01:58:08,671 --> 01:58:10,250
at Percy.

1476
01:58:10,250 --> 01:58:15,315
TALIESIN: Am I in line of sight? Yes, I am in line
of sight, aren't I? Do I have partial cover from

1477
01:58:15,315 --> 01:58:16,870
that? No, I don't.

1478
01:58:16,870 --> 01:58:29,972
MATT: All right, so you're firing it this way? So,
what is the-- Sunbeam! All right, Percy, I need

1479
01:58:29,972 --> 01:58:33,441
you to go ahead, because it is within a 60-foot
line, a constitution saving throw.

1480
01:58:33,441 --> 01:58:35,289
TALIESIN: Constitution saving throw?

1481
01:58:35,289 --> 01:58:36,569
MATT: Correct.

1482
01:58:36,569 --> 01:58:45,862
TALIESIN: Constitution saving throw. That's a 19.

1483
01:58:45,862 --> 01:58:47,196
MATT: What's your DC?

1484
01:58:47,196 --> 01:58:48,071
MARISHA: 19.

1485
01:58:48,071 --> 01:58:48,991
MATT: So he saves.

1486
01:58:48,991 --> 01:58:50,161
MARISHA: Fucking balls!

1487
01:58:50,161 --> 01:58:52,127
MATT and MARISHA: You take half damage.

1488
01:58:52,127 --> 01:59:00,177
MATT: As Keyleth, you go and you reach your hand
out, and suddenly the room blasts into bright

1489
01:59:00,177 --> 01:59:05,384
light as a beam of pure solar energy streaks into
Percy's face. Percy, you manage to close your eyes

1490
01:59:05,384 --> 01:59:08,323
and bend out of the way just in time, still taking
some of the impact.

1491
01:59:08,323 --> 01:59:24,362
MARISHA: (counting) 38 halved.

1492
01:59:24,362 --> 01:59:27,019
TALIESIN: 19 points?

1493
01:59:27,019 --> 01:59:32,676
MATT: You take 19 points of radiant damage. You
are not blinded because you made your save.

1494
01:59:32,676 --> 01:59:39,327
MARISHA: That is true. As a bonus action, I'm
going to cast Grasping Vine-- sorry, Percy.

1495
01:59:39,327 --> 01:59:44,177
MATT: Grasping Vine, unfortunately, is a 4th-level
spell. You have already cast a 6th-level spell. It

1496
01:59:44,177 --> 01:59:45,725
has to be 2nd or lower.

1497
01:59:45,725 --> 01:59:47,194
MARISHA: That is true. Never mind then.

1498
01:59:47,194 --> 01:59:52,800
MATT: I got to pay attention to this stuff.
Otherwise, the internet lets me know.

1499
01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:55,282
(laughter)

1500
01:59:55,282 --> 01:59:57,732
MARISHA: I'm going to go earth elemental.

1501
01:59:57,732 --> 01:59:59,321
MATT: Okay.

1502
01:59:59,321 --> 02:00:02,898
LIAM: Is it going to fit any more?

1503
02:00:02,898 --> 02:00:04,110
MATT: Barely.

1504
02:00:04,110 --> 02:00:05,804
LIAM: Holy cow. How high is the ceiling?

1505
02:00:05,804 --> 02:00:10,729
MATT: (laughing) The ceiling actually is about 30
feet up. It's a domed cavern.

1506
02:00:10,729 --> 02:00:11,665
LIAM: So watch your head.

1507
02:00:11,665 --> 02:00:16,376
MATT: You are set into this pocket of very hot
earth with no foreseeable exit.

1508
02:00:16,376 --> 02:00:20,675
MARISHA: And I am going to sink into the ground.

1509
02:00:20,675 --> 02:00:29,232
MATT: Okay. Keyleth sinks beneath the ground. As
you do, you suddenly feel yourself plummeting into

1510
02:00:29,232 --> 02:00:33,736
a pocket of molten rock which is beneath this
entire area here.

1511
02:00:33,736 --> 02:00:35,386
MARISHA: Okay, I come up really fast.

1512
02:00:35,386 --> 02:00:40,256
MATT: Okay, but you still go ahead and take damage
from this.

1513
02:00:40,256 --> 02:00:42,042
ASHLEY: And we are dealing with molten lava?

1514
02:00:42,042 --> 02:00:44,479
MARISHA: This is happening fast!

1515
02:00:44,479 --> 02:00:47,793
MATT: We will say here, for the purposes of this,
everyone gets a nice view of the top of my head.

1516
02:00:47,793 --> 02:00:51,435
TALIESIN: Bonus camera.

1517
02:00:51,435 --> 02:00:59,976
MATT: (counting)

1518
02:00:59,976 --> 02:01:01,542
ASHLEY: We don't know where Vax is?

1519
02:01:01,542 --> 02:01:04,076
TALIESIN: We do not know where Vax is. We know
that he is back there somewhere.

1520
02:01:04,076 --> 02:01:11,683
MATT: 35 points of fire damage from suddenly
submerging yourself partially into molten rock and

1521
02:01:11,683 --> 02:01:17,396
as your rock form does help resist it somewhat, it
still begins to severely damage your earth

1522
02:01:17,396 --> 02:01:20,280
elemental form and you immediately pop back up
into the space you were.

1523
02:01:20,280 --> 02:01:33,739
MARISHA: In that case--

1524
02:01:33,739 --> 02:01:37,717
MATT: In that case?

1525
02:01:37,717 --> 02:01:46,692
MARISHA: I'm happy where I am.

1526
02:01:46,692 --> 02:01:48,381
MATT: Happy where you are?

1527
02:01:48,381 --> 02:01:49,345
MARISHA: I'll stay there.

1528
02:01:49,345 --> 02:01:51,319
MATT: Okay, Keyleth ends her turn. Percy, you're
up.

1529
02:01:51,319 --> 02:02:05,931
TALIESIN: Let's figure out what we are doing with
this. First of all, I'm going to-- You got away,

1530
02:02:05,931 --> 02:02:09,760
you little son of a bitch. You're hiding back
there, aren't you?

1531
02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:13,703
MATT: You see this giant earth elemental submerge
and then come back out of the earth with elements

1532
02:02:13,703 --> 02:02:19,301
of superheated rock around the edges of its
surface. Pike is off to the side, looking about,

1533
02:02:19,301 --> 02:02:24,415
trying to decide what she's going to do, but you
have the jump on her.

1534
02:02:24,415 --> 02:02:42,856
TALIESIN: First off, I'm going to cast Hex on
Keyleth for the moment, because I've got to get

1535
02:02:42,856 --> 02:02:44,531
that thing off the board.

1536
02:02:44,531 --> 02:02:46,476
MATT: As a note, Keyleth by the way, because you
took fire damage, I need you to make a

1537
02:02:46,476 --> 02:02:48,289
concentration check to maintain your Sunbeam.

1538
02:02:48,289 --> 02:02:51,291
MARISHA: What do I have to roll?

1539
02:02:51,291 --> 02:02:55,574
MATT: Half the damage for-- how much did you take
from that?

1540
02:02:55,574 --> 02:02:58,201
MARISHA: I took 35 damage-- yeah, I am good.

1541
02:02:58,201 --> 02:02:59,422
MATT: You rolled a--

1542
02:02:59,422 --> 02:03:00,390
MARISHA: 15.

1543
02:03:00,390 --> 02:03:02,170
MATT: 15 plus your constitution-- yeah, you're
good.

1544
02:03:02,170 --> 02:03:16,123
TALIESIN: And I'm going to make you have
disadvantage on strength checks.

1545
02:03:16,123 --> 02:03:22,027
MATT: Strength checks are at disadvantage while
you're hexed. What else you got, Percy?

1546
02:03:22,027 --> 02:03:27,406
TALIESIN: I'm going to hit her with the Retort
pistol--

1547
02:03:27,406 --> 02:03:35,985
MATT: You whip out Retort.

1548
02:03:35,985 --> 02:03:44,686
TALIESIN: First shot is 23.

1549
02:03:44,686 --> 02:03:46,759
MATT: What's your AC for your earth elemental?

1550
02:03:46,759 --> 02:03:47,896
MARISHA: That hits.

1551
02:03:47,896 --> 02:03:49,263
MATT: Okay, so go ahead and roll damage on that.

1552
02:03:49,263 --> 02:03:51,593
LIAM: It's amazing how careful PVP is making us
all be.

1553
02:03:51,593 --> 02:03:52,379
ALL: I know!

1554
02:03:52,379 --> 02:03:54,067
ASHLEY: Seriously.

1555
02:03:54,067 --> 02:04:04,364
TALIESIN: That's 15 points of piercing damage plus
four necro damage.

1556
02:04:04,364 --> 02:04:08,166
MARISHA: Okay, piercing is halved for me?

1557
02:04:08,166 --> 02:04:10,626
MATT: It is not magical, correct.

1558
02:04:10,626 --> 02:04:12,172
TALIESIN: Oh, good to know.

1559
02:04:12,172 --> 02:04:20,072
MATT: That's seven damage plus four necrotic, so a
total of 11 points of damage. The blasts are hitting

1560
02:04:20,072 --> 02:04:24,963
the hide of the earth elemental, not quite
impacting as strongly as you thought.

1561
02:04:24,963 --> 02:04:31,967
TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to take one more
shot then and I'm going to spend a grit for a

1562
02:04:31,967 --> 02:04:38,601
headshot to give her disadvantage on attacks until
the end of her next turn.

1563
02:04:38,601 --> 02:04:44,760
MATT: Okay, make a concentration check by the way
from the first hit, so you have to roll an 11 or higher.

1564
02:04:44,760 --> 02:04:46,381
MARISHA: 11.

1565
02:04:46,381 --> 02:04:47,396
MATT: Yeah, you're fine.

1566
02:04:47,396 --> 02:04:48,655
(laughter)

1567
02:04:48,655 --> 02:04:55,519
TALIESIN: Oh, thank God, it's not Bad News. 15.
That doesn't hit.

1568
02:04:55,519 --> 02:04:56,982
MATT: Your AC?

1569
02:04:56,982 --> 02:04:58,140
MARISHA: 17.

1570
02:04:58,140 --> 02:05:02,839
MATT: 17, no. This one actually does manage to hit
the shoulder, but it ricochets off and blasts the

1571
02:05:02,839 --> 02:05:04,843
volcanic rock near her.

1572
02:05:04,843 --> 02:05:11,362
TALIESIN: Damn it. And just for fun, I'm going to
take a third shot to see if I can do anything.

1573
02:05:11,362 --> 02:05:14,539
MATT: Go for it. Third shot against the earth
elemental Keyleth.

1574
02:05:14,539 --> 02:05:18,686
TALIESIN: That does hit. That's a 21.

1575
02:05:18,686 --> 02:05:20,522
MATT: That does hit. Go ahead and roll 
damage on this.

1576
02:05:20,522 --> 02:05:30,033
TALIESIN: And that was not a grit shot. So
that's... that's nice. 15, halved again.

1577
02:05:30,033 --> 02:05:31,407
MARISHA: Seven.

1578
02:05:31,407 --> 02:05:32,953
TALIESIN: Plus six necrotic damage.

1579
02:05:32,953 --> 02:05:37,543
MATT: All right, so 13 points of damage total. I
need you to make another concentration check.

1580
02:05:37,543 --> 02:05:41,986
MARISHA: Ugh. Three.

1581
02:05:41,986 --> 02:05:43,891
MATT: What's your constitution modifier?

1582
02:05:43,891 --> 02:05:46,982
MARISHA: As an earth elemental? Plus five. So
eight.

1583
02:05:46,982 --> 02:05:51,820
MATT: With that, Sunbeam drops. The impact manages
to actually knock the spell out of your peripheral.

1584
02:05:51,820 --> 02:05:53,889
TALIESIN: And also, make a constitution saving
throw.

1585
02:05:53,889 --> 02:05:57,676
MARISHA: 14.

1586
02:05:57,676 --> 02:05:58,836
MATT: 19. So yeah.

1587
02:05:58,836 --> 02:06:01,279
TALIESIN: 19 is the DC, so does she make it?

1588
02:06:01,279 --> 02:06:02,391
MATT and MARISHA: Yeah, she makes it.

1589
02:06:02,391 --> 02:06:17,493
TALIESIN: Damn it! Ugh, should've done better. And
then I'm going to dive back here. For now I'm

1590
02:06:17,493 --> 02:06:22,353
going to try and get some cover. Yeah, dive back
there for some cover.

1591
02:06:22,353 --> 02:06:25,516
MATT: Okay, that ends Percy's turn. Pike, you're
up.

1592
02:06:25,516 --> 02:06:31,925
ASHLEY: Okay. So we're going to start-- I'm going
to cast Guardian of Faith and I would like to

1593
02:06:31,925 --> 02:06:32,892
place it--

1594
02:06:32,892 --> 02:06:34,329
MATT: Where would you want to place Guardian of
Faith?

1595
02:06:34,329 --> 02:06:38,619
ASHLEY: It's ten feet?

1596
02:06:38,619 --> 02:06:52,131
MATT: Let me see the spell here real fast to make
sure I've got this right. So, Guardian of Faith... there

1597
02:06:52,131 --> 02:07:01,421
we go. It's within 30 feet of you. Any hostile
creature to you that moves to a space within ten

1598
02:07:01,421 --> 02:07:04,124
feet of the guardian has to succeed-- so where are
you putting it?

1599
02:07:04,124 --> 02:07:05,715
ASHLEY: I'm going to place it right there.

1600
02:07:05,715 --> 02:07:06,595
MATT: Right there?

1601
02:07:06,595 --> 02:07:15,271
ASHLEY: Yeah. And then I am going to cast, for my
bonus action, Shield of Faith on myself, which

1602
02:07:15,271 --> 02:07:18,472
brings my armor class up by two points.

1603
02:07:18,472 --> 02:07:22,103
MATT: Guardian of Faith is 4th-level. What level
is that one?

1604
02:07:22,103 --> 02:07:23,564
ASHLEY: Shield of Faith is first.

1605
02:07:23,564 --> 02:07:38,163
MATT: Yeah, that's fine. So, Shield of Faith...
perfect. It's coming. So you have a plus two bonus

1606
02:07:38,163 --> 02:07:44,500
to AC for the duration. It's concentration. Good
for you. Are you going to move or stay right there?

1607
02:07:44,500 --> 02:07:51,511
ASHLEY: I'm going to just kind of-- well, he's
there. I'm going to stay. I'll stay.

1608
02:07:51,511 --> 02:07:55,248
MATT: Staying right there in that little corner.
All right, that ends Pike's turn. Top of the

1609
02:07:55,248 --> 02:07:56,777
round. Vax, you're up.

1610
02:07:56,777 --> 02:08:03,180
LIAM: Okay. I'm from a hidden position, right?
Advantage. Obviously.

1611
02:08:03,180 --> 02:08:07,203
MATT: Technically, they didn't see you. And from
what you're aware, nothing has seen you yet, so.

1612
02:08:07,203 --> 02:08:11,936
LIAM: Right. And as soon as I go, I'm giving away
my position to everybody or to the person that I'm

1613
02:08:11,936 --> 02:08:13,390
attacking, or--?

1614
02:08:13,390 --> 02:08:19,121
MATT: Essentially, everybody who could see where
you are, so you'd be giving it away to whoever

1615
02:08:19,121 --> 02:08:24,131
that individual is. Do you have your mini, by the
way?

1616
02:08:24,131 --> 02:08:25,093
LIAM: Yeah.

1617
02:08:25,093 --> 02:08:26,346
MATT: I was wondering where it went.

1618
02:08:26,346 --> 02:08:27,979
LIAM: Should I just place him as soon as I
attack?

1619
02:08:28,043 --> 02:08:28,723
MATT: Yep.

1620
02:08:28,723 --> 02:08:31,550
LIAM: Okay. I throw a dagger at Keyleth.

1621
02:08:31,550 --> 02:08:33,434
MATT: Okay.

1622
02:08:33,434 --> 02:08:35,698
MARISHA: But I'm partially covered.

1623
02:08:35,698 --> 02:08:37,711
LIAM: Doesn't matter. I'm a sharpshooter.

1624
02:08:37,711 --> 02:08:39,112
MATT: Yeah, he avoids cover.

1625
02:08:39,112 --> 02:08:41,870
LIAM: So that's a 19.

1626
02:08:41,870 --> 02:08:42,844
MARISHA: Hits.

1627
02:08:42,844 --> 02:09:04,362
LIAM: Okay, so here we go. That's two, plus
(counting) 24 plus six is 30.

1628
02:09:04,362 --> 02:09:07,003
MARISHA: Is that halved? Is that magic or no?

1629
02:09:07,003 --> 02:09:09,103
MATT: His weapons are magic, so does not halve.

1630
02:09:09,103 --> 02:09:10,099
MARISHA: So 30?

1631
02:09:10,099 --> 02:09:12,545
MATT: 30 points of magical slashing damage against
you.

1632
02:09:12,545 --> 02:09:20,206
LIAM: Then I will use my bonus action to hide. Can
I?

1633
02:09:20,206 --> 02:09:23,479
MATT: You, right now, are completely visible to
her.

1634
02:09:23,479 --> 02:09:36,089
LIAM: Okay. So instead, I'm going to go-- I don't
know if this is slowing me, but (counting) six.

1635
02:09:36,089 --> 02:09:37,924
Can I attempt to now?

1636
02:09:37,924 --> 02:09:45,148
MATT: You can attempt to hide from her, yeah.
However, Percy does have sight to you.

1637
02:09:45,148 --> 02:09:47,657
LIAM: Can I attempt to stealth from both of them?

1638
02:09:47,657 --> 02:09:49,440
MATT: Right now, you're only obscured from one of
them.

1639
02:09:49,440 --> 02:09:51,164
LIAM: I thought it was low light everywhere.

1640
02:09:51,164 --> 02:10:01,822
MATT: It is dim light, actually. Let me see what
the hide circumstance is. Let me double-check,

1641
02:10:01,822 --> 02:10:20,238
just to be safe. Hide action. In just a minute.
Hide. Chapter seven for hiding! All right, let's

1642
02:10:20,306 --> 02:10:22,091
go to chapter seven, then.

1643
02:10:22,091 --> 02:10:25,218
TALIESIN: Meanwhile, in chapter seven.

1644
02:10:25,218 --> 02:10:28,048
MATT: I know, it's great, isn't it? Isn't it
wonderful?

1645
02:10:28,048 --> 02:10:31,701
TALIESIN: Chapter seven is actually hiding in
chapter four.

1646
02:10:31,701 --> 02:10:33,966
MATT: I just want to make sure we're doing this
properly.

1647
02:10:33,966 --> 02:10:41,427
TALIESIN: It's really hiding from itself. Aren't
we all?

1648
02:10:41,427 --> 02:11:02,987
MATT: You are not helping me by telling me it's
there! This is ridiculous. I'm pretty sure you

1649
02:11:02,987 --> 02:11:10,045
have to be entirely obscured; it's not so much
having dim light. I might be wrong, but I don't

1650
02:11:10,045 --> 02:11:12,124
want them to tell me--

1651
02:11:12,124 --> 02:11:20,267
MARISHA: Hiding is poorly explained in the
Player's Handbook, honestly. Yeah. It's great.

1652
02:11:20,267 --> 02:11:25,724
LIAM: Got it, never mind. Hold on. Instead. Oh. I
have a backup idea.

1653
02:11:25,724 --> 02:11:33,944
MATT: Hiding. There it is. You can't hide from a
creature that can see you.

1654
02:11:33,944 --> 02:11:36,482
LIAM: Can he see in dim light?

1655
02:11:36,482 --> 02:11:50,290
MATT: He can see in dim light. It's not darkness.
He has disadvantage to perception checks because

1656
02:11:50,290 --> 02:11:52,651
it's dim light. He does not have darkvision.

1657
02:11:52,651 --> 02:11:55,951
LIAM: What's her line of sight? She can see here,
obviously.

1658
02:11:55,951 --> 02:11:59,700
MATT: She can see there. She would not be able to
see you in this area here behind that wall. That's

1659
02:11:59,700 --> 02:12:01,689
how it would work. Okay, I feel better about
that.

1660
02:12:01,689 --> 02:12:09,610
LIAM: I'm going to use an action to hide where I
am. Gosh, how would this work? I want to hide and

1661
02:12:09,610 --> 02:12:13,799
then run past here. If I'm stealthed successfully,
I'm invisible to Percy by the time I get here, and

1662
02:12:13,799 --> 02:12:18,344
if I'm past the wall, she's lost sight of me.
That's what I think. That's what I'm going to try to do.

1663
02:12:18,344 --> 02:12:19,635
MATT: So what are you trying to do?

1664
02:12:19,635 --> 02:12:27,271
LIAM: I'm going stealth. That's great. That is a
32.

1665
02:12:27,271 --> 02:12:30,840
MATT: 32. You move past here.

1666
02:12:30,840 --> 02:12:38,315
LIAM: I'm using my bonus action to dash. I'm going
to real quiet, tippy-toe in dim light. I'm a 32,

1667
02:12:38,315 --> 02:12:39,908
still stealthing tippy-toe.

1668
02:12:39,908 --> 02:12:44,418
MATT: I need Percy to make a perception check with
disadvantage.

1669
02:12:44,418 --> 02:12:46,476
MARISHA: What about me? No?

1670
02:12:46,476 --> 02:12:48,754
LIAM: I've just passed the wall.

1671
02:12:48,754 --> 02:12:51,391
TALIESIN: 16.

1672
02:12:51,391 --> 02:13:02,601
MATT: He vanishes from sight from both of you
guys. Where do you want to go? Okay. cool. That

1673
02:13:02,601 --> 02:13:04,484
ends Vax's turn. Keyleth, you're up.

1674
02:13:04,484 --> 02:13:07,641
MARISHA: It's my turn again already?

1675
02:13:07,641 --> 02:13:09,110
TALIESIN: There's only four of us.

1676
02:13:09,110 --> 02:13:09,892
MARISHA: Wow.

1677
02:13:09,892 --> 02:13:10,803
TALIESIN: I know.

1678
02:13:10,803 --> 02:13:17,104
MARISHA: Okay.

1679
02:13:17,104 --> 02:13:21,289
MATT: No, it was half the damage you took. I'm
trying to remember. You actually would still have

1680
02:13:21,289 --> 02:13:22,867
Sunbeam still up.

1681
02:13:22,867 --> 02:13:25,730
TALIESIN: It was also full necrotic damage.

1682
02:13:25,730 --> 02:13:31,328
MATT: It was, but even then it's half the damage
or a ten or higher. I was thinking of full damage

1683
02:13:31,328 --> 02:13:36,167
at the time. It's half the damage or ten, whichever's
higher. So you would still have Sunbeam.

1684
02:13:36,167 --> 02:13:39,672
MARISHA: That changes everything.

1685
02:13:39,672 --> 02:13:41,575
MATT: I'm sorry. I just realized that.

1686
02:13:41,575 --> 02:13:44,406
TALIESIN: I'm out of sight now.

1687
02:13:44,406 --> 02:13:46,092
MATT: You are, yeah.

1688
02:13:46,092 --> 02:13:47,435
TALIESIN: Thank god.

1689
02:13:47,435 --> 02:13:49,263
MATT: She still saw where you walked.

1690
02:13:49,263 --> 02:14:08,380
MARISHA: Fucking fuck. I still have Sunbeam.
Sorry, that changed my whole plan. Sorry, Pike.

1691
02:14:08,380 --> 02:14:13,248
TALIESIN: Does that mean there's that much light
in the cavern that I'm not at disadvantage?

1692
02:14:13,248 --> 02:14:23,294
MARISHA: Whenever I blast. I'm going to flip
around here. Fling! Sunbeam blast Pike.

1693
02:14:23,294 --> 02:14:32,149
MATT: Need you to roll constitution, I believe.

1694
02:14:32,149 --> 02:14:33,528
MARISHA: Constitution!

1695
02:14:33,528 --> 02:14:35,348
MATT: Roll a constitution check, Pike.

1696
02:14:35,348 --> 02:14:39,892
ASHLEY: All right! What's the--

1697
02:14:39,892 --> 02:14:48,802
MATT: Wait, you rolled a three with a plus five
con mod. I apologize. I'm so sorry about this. The

1698
02:14:48,802 --> 02:14:54,512
chat room is really distracting me on this. It was
a 13 halved, but ten, whichever's higher. Ten

1699
02:14:54,512 --> 02:14:57,372
would have still been the DC. You rolled a three
with a plus five, so you did still lose Sunbeam.

1700
02:14:57,372 --> 02:15:01,792
My apologies. You guys are helpful sometimes. I
really need to ignore chat.

1701
02:15:01,792 --> 02:15:04,277
MARISHA: So I lost Sunbeam.

1702
02:15:04,277 --> 02:15:05,636
MATT: You did lose Sunbeam, yes.

1703
02:15:05,636 --> 02:15:07,551
MARISHA: But I rolled higher than half?

1704
02:15:07,551 --> 02:15:11,647
MATT: Half or ten, whichever is higher, is how
concentration works.

1705
02:15:11,647 --> 02:15:13,301
MARISHA: So I always have to beat a ten?

1706
02:15:13,301 --> 02:15:14,802
MATT: Always have to beat a ten no matter what.

1707
02:15:14,802 --> 02:15:15,869
MARISHA: That sucks.

1708
02:15:15,869 --> 02:15:16,802
MATT: Yeah, sorry.

1709
02:15:16,802 --> 02:15:18,277
MARISHA: You're sure it's not the other way?

1710
02:15:18,277 --> 02:15:19,435
MATT: I'm sure it's not the other way.

1711
02:15:19,435 --> 02:15:24,025
MARISHA: Okay. That changes things again.

1712
02:15:24,025 --> 02:15:28,550
MATT: That's why I don't have chat on during the
game. I start second-guessing myself and I realize

1713
02:15:28,550 --> 02:15:31,920
it's okay. You guys are kind of helpful sometimes,
it's fine!

1714
02:15:31,920 --> 02:15:34,437
TALIESIN and ASHLEY: Guys!

1715
02:15:34,437 --> 02:15:38,854
MATT: You are hexed, you do not have Sunbeam, but
you are still full earth elemental form.

1716
02:15:38,854 --> 02:15:50,262
MARISHA: Okay. This is a lava pool right here?

1717
02:15:50,262 --> 02:15:57,932
MATT: It is a portion of the wall in which there
is molten rock pooling out of the side, yes. You

1718
02:15:57,932 --> 02:16:03,710
get the feeling this whole room has pockets of it
that are based around molten rock. You can see

1719
02:16:03,710 --> 02:16:06,478
which ones seem to be closer than others.

1720
02:16:06,478 --> 02:16:16,389
MARISHA: Fuck it. I'm going to come here because I
do double damage to rock things. I'm going to

1721
02:16:16,389 --> 02:16:17,964
smash this open.

1722
02:16:17,964 --> 02:16:19,381
MATT: You want to smash that open?

1723
02:16:19,381 --> 02:16:20,793
MARISHA: I want to smash that wall.

1724
02:16:20,793 --> 02:16:22,040
MATT: Roll an attack!

1725
02:16:22,040 --> 02:16:26,199
TALIESIN: Yeah! Break it down!

1726
02:16:26,199 --> 02:16:36,939
MARISHA: 16 plus whatever I do against-- what do I
roll? It's just a regular attack? It's just a

1727
02:16:36,939 --> 02:16:47,231
regular attack. Then I'm adding plus five, so 22.
No, 21.

1728
02:16:47,231 --> 02:16:52,358
MATT: Your fist slams into the wall. Roll double
damage because you're siege and this is

1729
02:16:52,358 --> 02:17:02,377
technically part of a structure. Roll damage on
your slam.

1730
02:17:02,377 --> 02:17:08,850
MARISHA: Hang on. It's plus eight to hit, so it
was actually more. 2d8 plus five.

1731
02:17:08,850 --> 02:17:11,783
MATT: 2d8 plus five and then double.

1732
02:17:11,783 --> 02:17:13,504
MARISHA: I double the dice?

1733
02:17:13,504 --> 02:17:15,036
MATT: Double the whole thing.

1734
02:17:15,036 --> 02:17:22,326
MARISHA: So I roll two more? Oh, I double the
whole thing. Ten plus five. 30 damage!

1735
02:17:22,326 --> 02:17:28,457
MATT: 30 points of damage to the rock wall with
one fist. Your knuckles take out a portion of the

1736
02:17:28,457 --> 02:17:36,038
wall and molten rock begins to spill into the
alley here. This whole area right now is spilling

1737
02:17:36,038 --> 02:17:41,575
molten rock and is now considered an area of lava
that is slowly expanding.

1738
02:17:41,575 --> 02:17:51,784
MARISHA: With that, I am going to back up, move,
and tuck here behind this wall.

1739
02:17:51,784 --> 02:17:54,721
MATT: You'd have enough movement, I think, to do
that.

1740
02:17:54,721 --> 02:17:55,912
MARISHA: With my earthglide as well.

1741
02:17:55,912 --> 02:18:01,301
MATT: With your earthglide? Yeah. Instead of going
around it, you just boof through the wall. That's

1742
02:18:01,301 --> 02:18:10,899
fine. That ends your turn. Percy, you're up. You
see the glow of fresh molten rock beginning to

1743
02:18:10,899 --> 02:18:16,753
spill from around the wall side, though you're not
sure what the source is. Pike, the heat's causing

1744
02:18:16,753 --> 02:18:18,431
you to sweat within your armor.

1745
02:18:18,431 --> 02:18:26,572
TALIESIN: I'm coming in around here. I'm going to
take some shots at Pike.

1746
02:18:26,572 --> 02:18:32,815
ASHLEY: Come on! (singing) Shot through the
heart!

1747
02:18:32,815 --> 02:18:35,212
ALL: (singing) And you're to blame!

1748
02:18:35,212 --> 02:18:39,767
MATT: As soon as you step into that spot--

1749
02:18:39,767 --> 02:18:42,995
TALIESIN: Am I not ten feet away from it? Oh, I
wouldn't even know, would I?

1750
02:18:42,995 --> 02:18:48,092
MATT: You wouldn't know! You have no idea. As soon
as you step into that spot, what's the saving

1751
02:18:48,092 --> 02:18:50,377
throw on the guardian?

1752
02:18:50,377 --> 02:18:53,630
ASHLEY: 18.

1753
02:18:53,630 --> 02:19:00,667
MATT: That's the DC. Guardian of Faith. I need you
to roll a dexterity saving throw.

1754
02:19:00,667 --> 02:19:02,044
TALIESIN: Dex saving throw?

1755
02:19:02,044 --> 02:19:03,349
MATT: Yes.

1756
02:19:03,349 --> 02:19:13,197
TALIESIN: That's a 15, but I don't like that, I'm
going to reroll it.

1757
02:19:13,197 --> 02:19:14,576
MATT: With your feat.

1758
02:19:14,576 --> 02:19:20,165
TALIESIN: Yeah. That's a natural 20.

1759
02:19:20,165 --> 02:19:21,363
ASHLEY: All right.

1760
02:19:21,363 --> 02:19:28,147
MATT: You take half damage. You take ten points of
radiant damage. Mark a 50 for you so keep track of

1761
02:19:28,147 --> 02:19:29,359
the damage.

1762
02:19:29,359 --> 02:19:30,501
TALIESIN: So I took ten points.

1763
02:19:30,501 --> 02:19:33,534
MATT: Ten points of radiant damage as you stop
right there in that spot. Suddenly, you see a glow

1764
02:19:33,534 --> 02:19:41,044
emerge from the stone pillar and this armored
half-golem made of pure radiant energy scoops out

1765
02:19:41,044 --> 02:19:45,757
and slams you with a fist. You manage to pull out
of the way just in time, but it still slams you in

1766
02:19:45,757 --> 02:19:47,763
the shoulder, almost knocking you off your feet.
You catch yourself.

1767
02:19:47,763 --> 02:19:49,043
TALIESIN: Can I back up away from it?

1768
02:19:49,043 --> 02:19:50,348
MATT: With the rest of your turn, you can.

1769
02:19:50,348 --> 02:19:56,847
TALIESIN: I still have one more space of movement.
Okay. Fuck that guy. First thing, I'm going to use

1770
02:19:56,847 --> 02:20:20,216
my bonus action to run a quick heal. That sucked
so bad. That's 13 points back. (counting) That was

1771
02:20:20,216 --> 02:20:25,398
just awful. That just makes me sad. That couldn't
have gone worse. That's burned all that. I'm going

1772
02:20:25,398 --> 02:20:31,961
to take a shot at Pike.

1773
02:20:31,961 --> 02:20:39,423
ASHLEY: (singing) Bring it on!

1774
02:20:39,423 --> 02:20:41,541
TALIESIN: And my gun seizes.

1775
02:20:41,541 --> 02:20:42,884
MATT: Oh no!

1776
02:20:42,884 --> 02:20:44,711
TALIESIN: Flipping that out for Bad News.

1777
02:20:44,711 --> 02:20:45,854
MARISHA: Oh fuck!

1778
02:20:45,854 --> 02:20:51,358
MATT: So Retort goes back in the holster as you
see Percy around the corner, pull out from his

1779
02:20:51,358 --> 02:20:52,667
back, unfolds and locks into place.

1780
02:20:52,667 --> 02:20:56,684
TALIESIN: I have room for one shot before my turn
is over. Here we go, my one shot. Let's not do

1781
02:20:56,684 --> 02:21:05,308
that again, that was really inappropriate. Better!
32 to hit.

1782
02:21:05,308 --> 02:21:11,081
ASHLEY: (laughing) Yeah, that hits. That'll do,
pig, that'll do.

1783
02:21:11,081 --> 02:21:20,612
TALIESIN: 23 points of damage.

1784
02:21:20,612 --> 02:21:23,338
MATT: 23 points of piercing damage against Pike.

1785
02:21:23,338 --> 02:21:30,239
LIAM: I'm known as a scavenger.

1786
02:21:30,239 --> 02:21:34,512
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, I'm really annoyed right now.
I'm really annoyed.

1787
02:21:34,512 --> 02:21:40,901
LIAM: (laughing) It's all I got. I ain't got any
hexes or bullets or bits of spells or help from

1788
02:21:40,901 --> 02:21:42,452
the gods.

1789
02:21:42,452 --> 02:21:44,518
ASHLEY: Okay. Oof.

1790
02:21:44,518 --> 02:21:47,500
TALIESIN: You know, the minute I have sights on
you, you're dead.

1791
02:21:47,500 --> 02:21:49,259
LIAM: You'll never have sights on me.

1792
02:21:49,259 --> 02:21:53,779
TALIESIN: I know I'll never have sights on you. I
may have to burn a turn fixing a gun, too.

1793
02:21:53,779 --> 02:22:05,606
ASHLEY: Okay, well, I got to heal myself because I
have such low hit points. I have a different plan

1794
02:22:05,606 --> 02:22:11,678
now since that happened. Where did it go? Okay,
I'm going to do Cure Wounds on myself.

1795
02:22:11,678 --> 02:22:12,840
MATT: All righty.

1796
02:22:12,840 --> 02:22:16,862
ASHLEY: With a 3rd-level.

1797
02:22:16,862 --> 02:22:26,397
MATT: Cure Wounds at what level?

1798
02:22:26,397 --> 02:22:27,853
ASHLEY: Third.

1799
02:22:27,853 --> 02:22:31,695
MATT: 3rd-level? What else are you doing in your
turn?

1800
02:22:31,695 --> 02:22:34,338
ASHLEY: What else am I going to do? I'm going to
move.

1801
02:22:34,338 --> 02:22:38,509
MATT: Just so you're mindful, 3rd-level means you
can't cast another spell that's not above

1802
02:22:38,509 --> 02:22:40,272
2nd-level. Just so you know.

1803
02:22:40,272 --> 02:22:41,515
ASHLEY: Yeah. I'm just going to do that and then
move.

1804
02:22:41,515 --> 02:22:42,433
MATT: Okay, cool.

1805
02:22:42,433 --> 02:22:45,068
ASHLEY: Okay. (counting)

1806
02:22:45,068 --> 02:22:55,893
MARISHA: Tensions are so high, you guys.

1807
02:22:55,893 --> 02:22:57,312
MATT: I know.

1808
02:22:57,312 --> 02:23:04,056
TALIESIN: Not with Liam, Liam is just like,
whatever. It's like, "You don't know. You don't

1809
02:23:04,056 --> 02:23:05,366
"know me."

1810
02:23:05,366 --> 02:23:08,375
LIAM: Could still easily die. As soon as I go for
it, pops his head up, he's getting shot.

1811
02:23:08,375 --> 02:23:10,800
ASHLEY: I'm going to move over here.

1812
02:23:10,800 --> 02:23:17,158
MATT: Over there? All right. So you scoot over
into this mid-area as the gnome cleric hides

1813
02:23:17,158 --> 02:23:24,237
between the two boundaries of this rock formation,
this small hallway. There you are, and you hear

1814
02:23:24,237 --> 02:23:29,159
the burbling of slow-moving molten rock behind
you. All right, that ends Pike's turn, we're back

1815
02:23:29,159 --> 02:23:30,656
up to the top. Vax, you're up.

1816
02:23:30,656 --> 02:23:33,208
LIAM: Oh my gosh, okay. Great.

1817
02:23:33,208 --> 02:23:35,244
MATT: So you move?

1818
02:23:35,244 --> 02:23:45,887
LIAM: Yeah, no. Well, it's fine, it's where I was,
but I was going to just use-- and I'm here and

1819
02:23:45,887 --> 02:23:49,107
then I throw a dagger. That's the flame-tongue--

1820
02:23:49,107 --> 02:23:53,596
TALIESIN: He's being so secretive. This is
pressure. I'm feeling some pressure.

1821
02:23:53,596 --> 02:23:58,547
LIAM: That hits. That's a 25. And here we go
again.

1822
02:23:58,547 --> 02:24:01,103
MATT: Another ranged sneak attack against the
earth elemental?

1823
02:24:01,103 --> 02:24:16,244
LIAM: Mm-hmm, okay. (counting) It's not that good,
another 30 total.

1824
02:24:16,244 --> 02:24:19,369
MATT: All right. 30 points of piercing damage
against your earth elemental form, the dagger

1825
02:24:19,369 --> 02:24:25,977
striking part of your armored self and causing the
stone to shatter and break in a section. How you

1826
02:24:25,977 --> 02:24:27,585
at health-wise, Keyleth?

1827
02:24:27,585 --> 02:24:29,277
MARISHA: I'm still an earth elemental.

1828
02:24:29,277 --> 02:24:33,578
LIAM: Then I take one step this way, which I think
takes me out of her line of sight? Or do I need to

1829
02:24:33,578 --> 02:24:34,641
go one more?

1830
02:24:34,641 --> 02:24:35,684
MATT: You have to keep going.

1831
02:24:35,684 --> 02:24:36,797
LIAM: How about here?

1832
02:24:36,797 --> 02:24:38,217
MATT: Wherever you think you need to be.

1833
02:24:38,217 --> 02:24:46,945
LIAM: All right. I'm here and I'm going to use a
bonus action and an action and use another action

1834
02:24:46,945 --> 02:24:48,218
to go stealth.

1835
02:24:48,218 --> 02:24:49,845
MATT: Of your Haste? Okay.

1836
02:24:49,845 --> 02:24:56,360
LIAM: Good, real good. 29.

1837
02:24:56,360 --> 02:25:00,715
MATT: Okay. Percy, I need you to roll another
perception check.

1838
02:25:00,715 --> 02:25:02,621
LIAM: Isn't he covered by this?

1839
02:25:02,621 --> 02:25:05,956
MATT: He can still see past that. There's a
base-to-base visible. You do not have

1840
02:25:05,956 --> 02:25:10,245
disadvantage, though, because Sunbeam actually
does give bright light in the room for a vicinity.

1841
02:25:10,245 --> 02:25:12,814
LIAM: What'd you get?

1842
02:25:12,814 --> 02:25:19,863
TALIESIN: What is it, perception? That's a 25.

1843
02:25:19,863 --> 02:25:22,143
MATT: Nope. You have no idea.

1844
02:25:22,143 --> 02:25:24,853
TALIESIN: Literally, I rolled a 17.

1845
02:25:24,853 --> 02:25:26,083
MATT: Yeah.

1846
02:25:26,083 --> 02:25:32,179
ASHLEY: Do you have to roll a natural 20?

1847
02:25:32,179 --> 02:25:36,089
TALIESIN: I would probably have to roll a natural
20 to actually see him.

1848
02:25:36,089 --> 02:25:44,166
MATT: Yeah, you do. All right, you're there. That
brings us to Keyleth.

1849
02:25:44,166 --> 02:25:47,662
MARISHA: Shit. This keeps happening.

1850
02:25:47,662 --> 02:26:00,128
MATT: You do drop Sunbeam. God, I'm so confused
now. I'm so confused. You guys have confused me.

1851
02:26:00,128 --> 02:26:01,690
MARISHA: I have not cast Sunbeam since you told me
I--

1852
02:26:01,690 --> 02:26:04,447
MATT: No, I know. So you still had disadvantage,
but you would have missed anyway.

1853
02:26:04,447 --> 02:26:06,407
TALIESIN: I rolled a 17, there's nothing I could
have done.

1854
02:26:06,407 --> 02:26:09,335
MATT: Ugh, I'm going to just cover the chat now.

1855
02:26:09,335 --> 02:26:11,272
MARISHA: You can face it away.

1856
02:26:11,272 --> 02:26:14,913
TALIESIN: No, it's good that tonight is your derp
night.

1857
02:26:14,913 --> 02:26:16,667
MATT: I'm covering it up for my own purposes.

1858
02:26:16,667 --> 02:26:20,762
But yeah. No worries, it's fine.

1859
02:26:20,762 --> 02:26:27,305
MARISHA: I'm going to do something similar and I'm
going to move and I'm going to go bam and slam

1860
02:26:27,305 --> 02:26:34,022
into that one. Come over here, reach, you know?

1861
02:26:34,022 --> 02:26:36,804
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll your attack.

1862
02:26:36,804 --> 02:26:44,639
MARISHA: Okay. That's good. It's a plus eight.
14.

1863
02:26:44,639 --> 02:26:46,831
MATT: That's fine. It's enough to hit the rock. Go
ahead and roll damage.

1864
02:26:46,831 --> 02:27:00,536
MARISHA: Shit. 18 damage.

1865
02:27:00,536 --> 02:27:06,158
MATT: 18 damage? Doubled? Okay. So 18 points of
damage. Your fist slams through the piece of rock

1866
02:27:06,158 --> 02:27:11,590
there. It does open up some of the area and some
of the lava begins to spill out, but it's just a

1867
02:27:11,590 --> 02:27:13,515
slow trickle, it's not a large deluge.

1868
02:27:13,515 --> 02:27:20,426
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to do my second attack,
then. Bam. That's much better. That's a 16 plus eight.

1869
02:27:20,426 --> 02:27:22,789
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage. All right, chat.

1870
02:27:22,789 --> 02:27:33,496
MARISHA: All right. Also much better damage. So
that's 13 plus five, 18, so that is 36.

1871
02:27:33,496 --> 02:27:36,907
MATT: Splintering pieces of volcanic rock go
shattering through the room, skidding across the

1872
02:27:36,907 --> 02:27:43,292
ground. You guys hear the blast as suddenly molten
rock begins to spill out from that side now, also

1873
02:27:43,292 --> 02:27:49,471
beginning to illuminate that portion of the floor.
This whole vicinity is now also covered in lava.

1874
02:27:49,471 --> 02:27:52,700
This one has actually expanded outward to cover
that area.

1875
02:27:52,700 --> 02:27:57,592
MARISHA: Okay. And then I move back and I hide
again.

1876
02:27:57,592 --> 02:28:08,279
MATT: Okay. So that's five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30.
What's your full move on the earth elemental?

1877
02:28:08,279 --> 02:28:10,271
MARISHA: Just walking, 30. If I'm earthgliding,
60.

1878
02:28:10,271 --> 02:28:17,810
MATT: Are you then subterranean gliding through,
based on what you did before? Because if not, your

1879
02:28:17,810 --> 02:28:19,428
full movement's going to take you to there.

1880
02:28:19,428 --> 02:28:21,067
MARISHA: Well then I'll stay there, I guess.

1881
02:28:21,067 --> 02:28:26,972
MATT: Okay. Just so you know. All right, so you're
right there. Cool. Ends Keyleth's turn. Percy,

1882
02:28:26,972 --> 02:28:28,203
you're up.

1883
02:28:28,203 --> 02:28:38,912
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm peeking around. I see the
giant earth creature, and I'm taking a shot.

1884
02:28:38,912 --> 02:28:40,535
MATT: Go for it.

1885
02:28:40,535 --> 02:28:49,478
TALIESIN: Yep. Here we go. Actually, I'm going to
make it a-- no, I'm just going to take the shot. I

1886
02:28:49,478 --> 02:28:52,134
have to reload Bad News anyway, so this is the
reload shot.

1887
02:28:52,134 --> 02:28:55,056
MATT: So the first shot is reload, second attack
is a shot.

1888
02:28:55,056 --> 02:29:02,313
TALIESIN: Thank god. Nope, never mind, oh my god,
for the love of god and all that is holy. Gun broke.

1889
02:29:02,313 --> 02:29:06,975
MATT: Do you have any Lucky left? Don't forget you
have your luck points still. Your feat.

1890
02:29:06,975 --> 02:29:08,283
LIAM: Oh, did he take that feat?

1891
02:29:08,283 --> 02:29:10,658
MATT: He did for his level 14 feat for tonight.

1892
02:29:10,658 --> 02:29:13,543
TALIESIN: For tonight. I will never actually take
it, but for tonight.

1893
02:29:13,543 --> 02:29:20,141
ASHLEY and MARISHA: Oh no!

1894
02:29:20,141 --> 02:29:22,529
MATT: You can't double Lucky.

1895
02:29:22,529 --> 02:29:25,534
TALIESIN: I didn't know that. Well, it doesn't
matter, because the second luck was also a gun

1896
02:29:25,534 --> 02:29:26,841
break, anyway.

1897
02:29:26,841 --> 02:29:29,949
MATT: Okay. Bad News is also broken.

1898
02:29:29,949 --> 02:29:34,918
TALIESIN: I'm going to burn an action surge to fix
the gun.

1899
02:29:34,918 --> 02:29:43,125
MATT: Okay. Oof. All right. On which gun?

1900
02:29:43,125 --> 02:29:52,817
TALIESIN: On Bad News. And yes. It's fixed. Yeah,
it's way above the number.

1901
02:29:52,817 --> 02:29:59,081
MATT: Cool. All right. So, after the gun echoes
back, you can see the little bit of dull grey

1902
02:29:59,081 --> 02:30:04,382
smoke spilling from the barrel, which immediately
warns you of an impending blast, you put the gun

1903
02:30:04,382 --> 02:30:08,835
down and shake it to get the explosive material
out of the side as it just scatters upon the

1904
02:30:08,835 --> 02:30:12,945
ground and burns naturally. You manage to fix it
and ready it in time. A quick, swift action.

1905
02:30:12,945 --> 02:30:15,236
TALIESIN: And I dive right back there.

1906
02:30:15,236 --> 02:30:18,115
MATT: Okay. Right there?

1907
02:30:18,115 --> 02:30:21,723
TALIESIN: Yeah. Actually, I'm going to dive all
the way back here.

1908
02:30:21,723 --> 02:30:25,198
MATT: Okay. Gotcha. Ends your turn, Percy. Pike,
you're up.

1909
02:30:25,198 --> 02:30:27,953
ASHLEY: Okay. Can I make my way to Percy?

1910
02:30:27,953 --> 02:30:34,253
MATT: This way or this way? You step out to there.
You can see Percy right across the way.

1911
02:30:34,253 --> 02:30:36,689
ASHLEY: How close can I get to him?

1912
02:30:36,689 --> 02:30:38,258
MATT: You can get pretty close if you want to.

1913
02:30:38,258 --> 02:30:39,593
ASHLEY: I want to get very close.

1914
02:30:39,593 --> 02:30:42,525
TALIESIN: Aww. Wait, no. Damn it.

1915
02:30:42,525 --> 02:30:44,280
MATT: You can get right there, yeah. Right up next
to him.

1916
02:30:44,280 --> 02:30:52,997
ASHLEY: I am going to Inflict Wounds. Because I
can't use these necromancy spells in the regular

1917
02:30:52,997 --> 02:30:57,281
games. I'm gonna <i>use them</i>. I'm a monstah!

1918
02:30:57,281 --> 02:31:02,030
TALIESIN: Okay! I'm going to be fine. This is
fine.

1919
02:31:02,030 --> 02:31:03,712
MATT: All right, at what level are you inflicting
wounds?

1920
02:31:03,712 --> 02:31:13,141
ASHLEY: You know what? I'm going to do it at just
second level. Yeah, just second level, which is only--

1921
02:31:13,141 --> 02:31:17,441
MATT: Okay. So go ahead and roll a melee spell
attack. So roll a d20 and add your spell attack

1922
02:31:17,441 --> 02:31:19,318
modifier, which I believe is plus 11.

1923
02:31:19,318 --> 02:31:23,449
ASHLEY: Yeah. That would be a 28.

1924
02:31:23,449 --> 02:31:27,650
MATT: 28. You see Pike run around the corner, this
glowing beacon of energy, and as she goes towards

1925
02:31:27,650 --> 02:31:36,052
you, the radiant divine energy from her holy
symbol shrieks into a deep black dark purple. As

1926
02:31:36,052 --> 02:31:38,844
her hand reaches out and grasps at you, you try
and dodge out of the way but her hand touches you

1927
02:31:38,844 --> 02:31:46,618
and pain courses through your body. You take 4d10
necrotic damage, so go ahead and roll 4d10.

1928
02:31:46,618 --> 02:31:48,609
TALIESIN: Wow, really? Okay.

1929
02:31:48,609 --> 02:31:54,908
MARISHA: 4d10? Holy balls. Oh, shit.

1930
02:31:54,908 --> 02:32:00,415
TALIESIN: Oh my God, that's so-- oh, God. Oh, God!

1931
02:32:00,415 --> 02:32:06,308
ASHLEY: It was cocked. 21.

1932
02:32:06,308 --> 02:32:11,094
MATT: 21 points of necrotic damage as, all of a
sudden, the pain courses through your body, and a

1933
02:32:11,094 --> 02:32:13,783
side of Pike you've never seen before all of a
sudden frightens you.

1934
02:32:13,783 --> 02:32:17,855
TALIESIN: Yes. Yes, I am frightened. I am very
frightened.

1935
02:32:17,855 --> 02:32:25,328
MATT: All righty. You're just going to stay right
there? You still have your bonus action.

1936
02:32:25,328 --> 02:32:32,943
ASHLEY: Can I tuck back?

1937
02:32:32,943 --> 02:32:36,013
MATT: You don't have enough movement, you just got
there with your movement.

1938
02:32:36,013 --> 02:32:39,900
ASHLEY: Okay. Can I use my Sprinter's Boots?

1939
02:32:39,900 --> 02:32:46,080
MATT: You could. He will get a melee attack of
opportunity. You only have Bad News out, so it's

1940
02:32:46,080 --> 02:32:47,568
not really going to--

1941
02:32:47,568 --> 02:32:49,225
TALIESIN: Yeah, I was about to say, Bad News is--

1942
02:32:49,225 --> 02:32:51,109
MATT: Yeah, no. So you could if you want to.

1943
02:32:51,109 --> 02:32:54,319
ASHLEY: I'm going to use my Sprinter's Boots and
go back behind that wall where I was.

1944
02:32:54,319 --> 02:32:56,355
MATT: All right, you get right back to where you
were, yeah. Okay.

1945
02:32:56,355 --> 02:33:02,363
TALIESIN: I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

1946
02:33:02,363 --> 02:33:07,709
MATT: All righty. That brings it to Vax's turn.
This is getting interesting.

1947
02:33:07,709 --> 02:33:20,880
LIAM: Let's get dicey here. Okay. Can I have the
miniature? Oh, I have him right here, sorry. So I

1948
02:33:20,880 --> 02:33:25,814
want to step right out here, throw a sneak attack
dagger right at Percy. Here we go.

1949
02:33:25,814 --> 02:33:27,672
MARISHA: Whoa, you made good ground.

1950
02:33:27,672 --> 02:33:28,911
MATT: Haste, man.

1951
02:33:28,911 --> 02:33:38,797
LIAM: That is a 21. Does that hit?

1952
02:33:38,797 --> 02:33:45,347
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my amulet and bring it
up to 23.

1953
02:33:45,420 --> 02:33:47,305
LIAM: Then I'm going to use my last luck.

1954
02:33:47,305 --> 02:33:49,196
MATT: You already confirmed the attack.

1955
02:33:49,196 --> 02:33:51,200
LIAM: Oh, okay. All right. That's fine. I didn't
know that I had to--

1956
02:33:51,200 --> 02:33:53,778
MATT: Yeah, you have to roll, see what the roll
is, and then see if you want to reroll it before

1957
02:33:53,778 --> 02:33:55,559
you go ahead and confirm, I believe.

1958
02:33:55,559 --> 02:34:03,647
LIAM: Okay. I'm going to use my bonus action to
dash. Everyone sees me go (footsteps) and I'm

1959
02:34:03,647 --> 02:34:05,790
going to go stealth there.

1960
02:34:05,790 --> 02:34:12,394
TALIESIN: I hate you. I hate you so much! Oh! Oh,
from the depths of hell.

1961
02:34:12,394 --> 02:34:25,221
LIAM: I like better telling you. Well, ugh, yes.

1962
02:34:25,221 --> 02:34:28,711
MARISHA: As he says it out loud!

1963
02:34:28,711 --> 02:34:30,508
29?

1964
02:34:30,508 --> 02:34:37,651
MATT: Yeah. All right. So, that being the case,
I'm going to need-- no, you're just out of the

1965
02:34:37,651 --> 02:34:39,791
way. No one seems to see you.

1966
02:34:39,791 --> 02:34:44,525
LIAM: Okay. But I'm not done yet, because I've
still got quite a bit of movement left.

1967
02:34:44,525 --> 02:34:46,502
MATT: Right. Where are you moving to?

1968
02:34:46,502 --> 02:34:52,658
TALIESIN: Where you going, Liam? Where're you
going?

1969
02:34:52,658 --> 02:35:02,604
MATT: Okay. Let me see. Yeah. Okay. All righty.
Got it. Okay! All right. That ends Vax's turn.

1970
02:35:02,604 --> 02:35:04,478
Keyleth, you're up.

1971
02:35:04,478 --> 02:35:14,228
TALIESIN: God damn it. God damn it. I've had to
burn all my good stuff already.

1972
02:35:14,228 --> 02:35:16,391
LIAM: Easy pickings on de Rolo! Get him!

1973
02:35:16,391 --> 02:35:22,963
MATT: At the start of your turn, Keyleth, the lava
has now spread out into this way and has created a

1974
02:35:22,963 --> 02:35:24,875
complete bridge there.

1975
02:35:24,875 --> 02:35:26,320
MARISHA: What about over here?

1976
02:35:26,320 --> 02:35:29,471
MATT: That is beginning to spread. It will,
probably by next turn--

1977
02:35:29,471 --> 02:35:33,514
ASHLEY: Ooh, she's making a whole lava pool.
Remodeling.

1978
02:35:33,514 --> 02:35:37,053
TALIESIN: This is good. This makes my life easier.
I'm excited.

1979
02:35:37,053 --> 02:35:39,442
MATT: So, what are you doing, Keyleth?

1980
02:35:39,442 --> 02:35:43,665
TALIESIN: Did I just scare you?

1981
02:35:43,665 --> 02:35:49,332
MATT: And actually, Percy, I need you to roll a
concentration check against the damage you just

1982
02:35:49,332 --> 02:35:51,509
took. Oh, no, you missed, that's right.

1983
02:35:51,509 --> 02:35:52,763
TALIESIN: He missed! I was about to say.

1984
02:35:52,763 --> 02:35:56,574
MARISHA: Can I turn and see if I can spot Vax?

1985
02:35:56,574 --> 02:36:01,136
MATT: Well, it would be against Pike's damage. So
roll a concentration check against the damage that

1986
02:36:01,136 --> 02:36:02,426
Pike did to you.

1987
02:36:02,426 --> 02:36:03,549
TALIESIN: Concentration?

1988
02:36:03,549 --> 02:36:04,493
MATT: For Hex.

1989
02:36:04,493 --> 02:36:07,600
TALIESIN: Oh, Hex is not concentration. Is it? Oh,
okay.

1990
02:36:07,600 --> 02:36:12,649
MATT: I usually forget to mention it because you
don't take a lot of damage in battle most of the time.

1991
02:36:12,649 --> 02:36:17,623
TALIESIN: That might be new, because it's been so
long since I've had to--

1992
02:36:17,623 --> 02:36:19,016
MATT: Hex is concentration, yeah.

1993
02:36:19,016 --> 02:36:20,170
TALIESIN: Holy cow. Okay.

1994
02:36:20,170 --> 02:36:23,566
MATT: So roll a constitution check. Not save.

1995
02:36:23,566 --> 02:36:27,416
TALIESIN: That's a four.

1996
02:36:27,416 --> 02:36:29,519
MATT: Four. Hex has vanished from Keyleth.

1997
02:36:29,519 --> 02:36:36,070
MARISHA: Oh, cool. Awesome. Okay.

1998
02:36:36,070 --> 02:36:40,686
TALIESIN: I'm not having a good roll night. Not
having a good roll night.

1999
02:36:40,686 --> 02:36:42,126
MATT: It's been kind of rough for you, Percy.

2000
02:36:42,126 --> 02:36:43,561
TALIESIN: Yeah. This has been ugly.

2001
02:36:43,561 --> 02:36:52,646
MARISHA: I want to see if I can sense Vax with my
tremor sense. Can I do that?

2002
02:36:52,646 --> 02:36:54,442
MATT: You have tremor sense as an earth
elemental?

2003
02:36:54,442 --> 02:36:55,596
MARISHA: Yeah.

2004
02:36:55,596 --> 02:37:06,307
MATT: That's good to know. Hmm. Hold on a second.
Let me check something in here. It might be in here.

2005
02:37:06,307 --> 02:37:08,434
MARISHA: I wasn't sure if it would actually work.

2006
02:37:08,434 --> 02:37:11,091
MATT: No, that's an important note to bring up.
Thank you for that.

2007
02:37:11,091 --> 02:37:13,094
LIAM: Someone knows where I am.

2008
02:37:13,094 --> 02:37:16,894
MATT: Let me pull up the DMG here.

2009
02:37:16,894 --> 02:37:21,324
TALIESIN: Break him into sticks. To twigs and
feathers.

2010
02:37:21,324 --> 02:37:23,486
ASHLEY: Break him. Break him.

2011
02:37:23,486 --> 02:37:25,421
TALIESIN: Smear him across the cave.

2012
02:37:25,421 --> 02:37:28,782
MATT: All right. Let's go ahead and make sure I
get this right.

2013
02:37:28,782 --> 02:37:36,914
MARISHA: Here it says I have tremor sense, but I
use my own perception, because it's mind-based.

2014
02:37:36,914 --> 02:37:46,206
MATT: This is the DMG. Now, Monster Manual, you'll
answer my question. Pardon me, folks.

2015
02:37:46,206 --> 02:37:48,737
LIAM: Come on. Drama.

2016
02:37:48,737 --> 02:37:52,183
MATT: This is going to be interesting if this
works.

2017
02:37:52,183 --> 02:37:54,298
TALIESIN: I will be so pleased if this works.

2018
02:37:54,298 --> 02:38:03,519
MARISHA: This is so nerve-wracking. I can feel my
blood pressure going through the roof.

2019
02:38:03,519 --> 02:38:05,579
MATT: Yeah. What's the radius of your tremor
sense?

2020
02:38:05,579 --> 02:38:08,938
MARISHA: 60 feet.

2021
02:38:08,938 --> 02:38:12,299
MATT: Vax, you know, is right there.

2022
02:38:12,299 --> 02:38:14,167
LIAM: Now the whole group knows!

2023
02:38:14,167 --> 02:38:18,617
MATT: We're not going to play it that way. They
have no idea.

2024
02:38:18,617 --> 02:38:21,201
TALIESIN: We're not going to act on that intel.

2025
02:38:21,201 --> 02:38:23,910
LIAM: Well, once she starts smashing the ground
there, you'll have a good idea.

2026
02:38:23,910 --> 02:38:28,425
MATT: It's possible. Oh no, you'll take some
damage finally. What are you doing?

2027
02:38:28,425 --> 02:38:32,377
MARISHA: I'm going to beat Vax's face in.

2028
02:38:32,377 --> 02:38:37,208
MATT: Okay. So you're going to move into here?
Okay. As you think you're--

2029
02:38:37,208 --> 02:38:39,349
LIAM: All of her attacks are at disadvantage
because of my cloak.

2030
02:38:39,349 --> 02:38:41,900
MATT: It's true. So, all of a sudden--

2031
02:38:41,900 --> 02:38:43,332
MARISHA: Even with the tremor sense?

2032
02:38:43,332 --> 02:38:48,174
MATT: Yeah. It's not the hidden, it's his Cloak of
Displacement. So, all of a sudden, you turn the

2033
02:38:48,174 --> 02:38:54,192
corner and you see bounding up Keyleth's earth
elemental form zoning right in on you. Go ahead

2034
02:38:54,192 --> 02:38:55,868
and make your first attack with disadvantage.

2035
02:38:55,868 --> 02:38:57,244
MARISHA: (deep voice) I love you!

2036
02:38:57,244 --> 02:38:59,522
(laughter)

2037
02:38:59,522 --> 02:39:02,859
MARISHA: Not great! 15!

2038
02:39:02,859 --> 02:39:04,988
MATT: Nope. First attack misses.

2039
02:39:04,988 --> 02:39:08,011
MARISHA: Second attack, even worse! It's a two.

2040
02:39:08,011 --> 02:39:10,384
LIAM: Well, that was the first attack, the two
rolls with disadvantage.

2041
02:39:10,384 --> 02:39:12,141
MATT: Right, with disadvantage. Yeah. So she
misses.

2042
02:39:12,141 --> 02:39:17,643
MARISHA: Oh, that's fun to know. That's fun.
Doesn't matter. No. Three. Terrible! I rolled

2043
02:39:17,643 --> 02:39:19,590
fucking terribly.

2044
02:39:19,590 --> 02:39:23,636
TALIESIN: Wow. That was painful to watch.

2045
02:39:23,636 --> 02:39:27,064
MATT: But he's visible and he's there with you.

2046
02:39:27,064 --> 02:39:32,812
MARISHA: I'm going to go (deep voice) Hug! Hug!

2047
02:39:32,812 --> 02:39:37,922
MATT: All right. The lava has now spread and
connected with the other pool there. There are now

2048
02:39:37,922 --> 02:39:44,056
two streams of molten rock. All right. That brings
us to Percy.

2049
02:39:44,056 --> 02:40:02,959
TALIESIN: Damn it. Okay. One, two, three, four,
and I'm taking my shot here. Let's hope this goes

2050
02:40:02,959 --> 02:40:08,810
a little better than the last one, since this has
been really sucking. Straight Bad News shot.

2051
02:40:08,810 --> 02:40:19,270
Better! That's a 32 to hit.

2052
02:40:19,270 --> 02:40:21,537
MATT: That'll hit. Go ahead and roll damage on
Pike.

2053
02:40:21,537 --> 02:40:23,847
PIKE: No, it doesn't hit!

2054
02:40:23,847 --> 02:40:28,893
MATT: It was already loaded, right? Actually, it's
not already loaded, right? Because you had to fix

2055
02:40:28,893 --> 02:40:30,107
it last round.

2056
02:40:30,107 --> 02:40:31,899
TALIESIN: Yes, which is why this is my only shot.

2057
02:40:31,899 --> 02:40:39,278
ASHLEY: (singing) Give it to me, baby! Uh-huh, uh-huh!

2058
02:40:39,337 --> 02:40:41,545
MATT: Sorry about that, guys.

2059
02:40:41,545 --> 02:40:51,291
TALIESIN: That could be worse. 18 points of
damage.

2060
02:40:51,291 --> 02:40:56,114
MATT: 18 points of piercing damage. The blast hits
your armor. It rings in your ear for a minute, but

2061
02:40:56,114 --> 02:41:00,506
the pain from the impact of the bullet actually
touching past the inside of your chest is pretty

2062
02:41:00,506 --> 02:41:03,905
rough. You can feel the bullet probably lodged
itself an inch or two in.

2063
02:41:03,905 --> 02:41:11,859
TALIESIN: And I'm backing up for cover. Yep,
that's my run. That's what I got.

2064
02:41:11,859 --> 02:41:13,121
MATT: Pike, you're up.

2065
02:41:13,121 --> 02:41:14,378
ASHLEY: What'd you say it was? How many points?

2066
02:41:14,378 --> 02:41:18,953
TALIESIN: 18 points. Not that hardcore.

2067
02:41:18,953 --> 02:41:28,246
ASHLEY: Okay, write it down. Where'd he go?

2068
02:41:28,246 --> 02:41:30,297
MATT: He's over here. You saw him rush up.

2069
02:41:30,297 --> 02:41:36,922
MARISHA: We kind of paired off, you guys. I've
literally successfully split the battlefield in

2070
02:41:36,922 --> 02:41:39,926
half. At least I've accomplished something.

2071
02:41:39,926 --> 02:41:47,385
ASHLEY: I am going to walk over to him and I'm
going to Inflict Wounds again.

2072
02:41:47,385 --> 02:41:50,431
MATT: What level for the spell?

2073
02:41:50,431 --> 02:41:52,606
ASHLEY: Third.

2074
02:41:52,606 --> 02:41:56,646
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll another spell
attack.

2075
02:41:56,646 --> 02:42:08,419
ASHLEY: That would be 30.

2076
02:42:08,419 --> 02:42:11,708
MATT: Yeah, that'll hit. So go ahead and roll
another 4d10.

2077
02:42:11,708 --> 02:42:14,374
ASHLEY: I'm not here to heal you, I'm here to kill
you!

2078
02:42:14,374 --> 02:42:20,670
MARISHA: I am Pike from your nightmares.

2079
02:42:20,670 --> 02:42:27,865
TALIESIN: Oh, God, I just saw a zero pop up. Oh,
God. I don't want to look. I just don't want to

2080
02:42:27,865 --> 02:42:33,846
look. That's what you get.

2081
02:42:33,846 --> 02:42:40,602
MARISHA: Hex faded on me, correct? So I don't have
disadvantage anymore on my strength rolls?

2082
02:42:40,602 --> 02:42:43,663
MATT: On strength rolls you do not, no.

2083
02:42:43,663 --> 02:42:46,465
ASHLEY: 24.

2084
02:42:46,465 --> 02:42:52,722
MATT: 24 points of necrotic damage as Pike once
again comes running behind, slams her hand onto

2085
02:42:52,722 --> 02:42:56,853
you, and another jolt of horrible necrotic energy
strikes through your body. Your vision's beginning

2086
02:42:56,853 --> 02:42:58,724
to blur a little bit at the edges.

2087
02:42:58,724 --> 02:43:03,150
TALIESIN: 24, okay, so that's-- I can do that. All
right, yeah.

2088
02:43:03,150 --> 02:43:07,656
MATT: What are you at now?

2089
02:43:07,656 --> 02:43:13,699
TALIESIN: I'm fine. I've taken 87 points of
damage, so I'm fine. Not dead.

2090
02:43:13,699 --> 02:43:23,713
MATT: Good. All righty. Pike, you still have your
bonus action if you wanted to, or move if you want.

2091
02:43:23,713 --> 02:43:36,792
ASHLEY: I'm going to move back behind the wall.

2092
02:43:36,792 --> 02:43:39,810
TALIESIN: I'm going to take that attack of
opportunity.

2093
02:43:39,810 --> 02:43:45,707
MATT: He'll be able to get a melee attack on you
if you pull away, and you only have one more

2094
02:43:45,707 --> 02:43:47,324
square of movement anyway.

2095
02:43:47,324 --> 02:43:51,637
ASHLEY: I can't move just the one square behind
this wall?

2096
02:43:51,637 --> 02:43:53,956
MATT: You can move there.

2097
02:43:53,956 --> 02:43:57,853
ASHLEY: Can I move behind-- I mean, I know that's
not very far from him.

2098
02:43:57,853 --> 02:43:59,857
MATT: He'll get an attack on you for free.

2099
02:43:59,857 --> 02:44:08,181
ASHLEY: I will heal myself a little more. I'm
going to Cure Wounds on myself.

2100
02:44:08,181 --> 02:44:10,557
MATT: You've already used your action this turn to
do the Inflict Wounds.

2101
02:44:10,557 --> 02:44:23,893
ASHLEY: Oh, that's true. I'm going to Healing Word
as a bonus action. I'll just do a level one.

2102
02:44:23,893 --> 02:44:27,312
That's not that much, actually.

2103
02:44:27,312 --> 02:44:31,140
MATT: Nope. It's 1d4 plus five is what it'll be.

2104
02:44:31,140 --> 02:44:32,573
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll just do that.

2105
02:44:32,573 --> 02:44:35,355
MARISHA: Every little bit helps.

2106
02:44:35,355 --> 02:44:42,080
MATT: It's true. So you gain six hit points. All
righty. That ends your turn, Pike? You good?

2107
02:44:42,080 --> 02:44:43,336
ASHLEY: That'll end my turn.

2108
02:44:43,336 --> 02:44:44,609
MATT: All right. Vax, you're up.

2109
02:44:44,609 --> 02:44:49,210
LIAM: What I'd like to do is take two steps back
from the earth elemental.

2110
02:44:49,210 --> 02:44:50,801
TALIESIN: Attack of opportunity.

2111
02:44:50,801 --> 02:44:53,021
LIAM: You shut up. Let her do it.

2112
02:44:53,021 --> 02:44:57,433
MATT: Go ahead and make an attack of opportunity
on him with disadvantage.

2113
02:44:57,433 --> 02:45:00,201
MARISHA: But don't I get advantage because it's an
attack of opportunity?

2114
02:45:00,201 --> 02:45:01,249
MATT: No.

2115
02:45:01,249 --> 02:45:12,344
MARISHA: First one was a 16. Second one was a six,
which isn't great, so that's 14.

2116
02:45:12,344 --> 02:45:15,483
MATT: It meets air as he sweeps backward.

2117
02:45:15,483 --> 02:45:19,433
LIAM: For my first action, I would like to open up
a pouch in my belt and dump a bunch of metal

2118
02:45:19,433 --> 02:45:26,204
marbles out towards the elemental underneath, keep
moving so they're all around her feet is the intention.

2119
02:45:26,204 --> 02:45:31,259
MATT: A bunch of various metallic and glass
marbles all spill out onto the ground around you.

2120
02:45:31,259 --> 02:45:32,524
MARISHA: Okay.

2121
02:45:32,524 --> 02:45:42,267
MATT: All right.

2122
02:45:42,267 --> 02:45:52,085
MARISHA: What are you looking for?

2123
02:45:52,085 --> 02:45:55,197
MATT: There it is. The DMG. It spilled down.

2124
02:45:55,197 --> 02:45:58,288
TALIESIN: There's a marble stat.

2125
02:45:58,288 --> 02:46:02,426
MATT: (chuckles) What else are you doing, buddy?

2126
02:46:02,426 --> 02:46:20,828
LIAM: I'm going to use dash on my bonus action,
I'm going to move to here, and this'll be up to

2127
02:46:20,828 --> 02:46:24,988
the whim of the gods. Between this wall and all of
this stuff, I want to try to stealth right there.

2128
02:46:24,988 --> 02:46:27,920
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make a stealth check.

2129
02:46:27,920 --> 02:46:36,782
LIAM: Not great. I have one last luck.

2130
02:46:36,782 --> 02:46:38,962
MATT: All right. Is now the time?

2131
02:46:38,962 --> 02:46:50,569
LIAM: Yes. Same exact roll. It's not my day. All
right. It's okay, I am at 25 stealth. I'm not done

2132
02:46:50,569 --> 02:46:52,436
with my movement.

2133
02:46:52,436 --> 02:46:54,732
MATT: Percy, you do get to make a perception
roll.

2134
02:46:54,732 --> 02:46:57,812
MARISHA: What about me and my tremor sense?

2135
02:46:57,812 --> 02:47:00,973
MATT: You know where he is.

2136
02:47:00,973 --> 02:47:04,301
MARISHA: That's so good to know that that's how
that works.

2137
02:47:04,301 --> 02:47:06,855
TALIESIN: 17 is my perception.

2138
02:47:06,855 --> 02:47:10,756
MATT: You have no idea whereabouts he's gone off
to.

2139
02:47:10,756 --> 02:47:13,067
TALIESIN: Unless I can add my passive perception
to that, no.

2140
02:47:13,067 --> 02:47:24,187
MATT: I need you to go ahead and make an athletics
check to leap.

2141
02:47:24,187 --> 02:47:28,788
ASHLEY and MARISHA: (singing) Secrets, secrets,
secrets don't make friends.

2142
02:47:28,788 --> 02:47:32,001
LIAM: Not acrobatics? Can I parkour?

2143
02:47:32,001 --> 02:47:34,957
MATT: No. You can't parkour over molten rock.

2144
02:47:34,957 --> 02:47:38,676
LIAM: 19.

2145
02:47:38,676 --> 02:47:48,739
MATT: You manage to just skirt over the molten
area and not go plummeting a second time with your

2146
02:47:48,739 --> 02:47:49,929
foot in lava.

2147
02:47:49,929 --> 02:47:51,893
LIAM: It's okay, it's all a dream.

2148
02:47:51,893 --> 02:47:55,102
MATT: That brings us to Keyleth's turn. What are
you doing?

2149
02:47:55,102 --> 02:47:57,151
MARISHA: Can I hear where Vax is?

2150
02:47:57,151 --> 02:48:06,626
MATT: It's a 60-foot radius, right? Where are you
again, show me?

2151
02:48:06,626 --> 02:48:08,994
TALIESIN: I won't look, you can show him.

2152
02:48:08,994 --> 02:48:14,894
MATT: I'm just seeing the range here. All right,
no, you do not sense him. You felt him run this

2153
02:48:14,894 --> 02:48:17,070
way and then vanish.

2154
02:48:17,070 --> 02:48:24,869
MARISHA: Okay. What do I do now?

2155
02:48:24,869 --> 02:48:26,189
LIAM: Fall.

2156
02:48:26,189 --> 02:48:27,984
TALIESIN: Fly, you fool.

2157
02:48:27,984 --> 02:48:36,800
MARISHA: As an earth elemental, I want to bust
down this little wall right here.

2158
02:48:36,800 --> 02:48:39,600
LIAM: Still a square of marbles in front of you.

2159
02:48:39,600 --> 02:48:43,227
MATT: So you go ahead and take a blow on this wall
there?

2160
02:48:43,227 --> 02:48:45,390
MARISHA: Well, I'm going to do right here.

2161
02:48:45,390 --> 02:48:46,930
MATT: The whole wall is technically what you'd be
going for.

2162
02:48:46,930 --> 02:48:51,671
MARISHA: I don't want to tear down the whole wall.
I just want to tear down a section of it.

2163
02:48:51,671 --> 02:48:54,953
MATT: Okay. You have to move forward to do that.

2164
02:48:54,953 --> 02:48:56,752
MARISHA: All right. Let's try it.

2165
02:48:56,752 --> 02:48:58,546
MATT: I want you to make a dexterity check.

2166
02:48:58,546 --> 02:49:02,043
TALIESIN: That's akimbo. That's cocked.

2167
02:49:02,043 --> 02:49:06,225
MARISHA: 14.

2168
02:49:06,225 --> 02:49:17,263
MATT: You (grunting) sliding on the marbles, just
barely get yourself there. You don't fall prone

2169
02:49:17,263 --> 02:49:19,325
but you get yourself to the wall. Make your
attack.

2170
02:49:19,325 --> 02:49:23,295
MARISHA: (singing) Tiny dancer in my hand.
(punching)

2171
02:49:23,295 --> 02:49:25,120
(laughter)

2172
02:49:25,120 --> 02:49:27,079
ASHLEY: Sam's not here, but his spirit is.

2173
02:49:27,079 --> 02:49:33,053
MARISHA: That's a one for the first one, so
negative.

2174
02:49:33,053 --> 02:49:36,126
MATT: The first fist hits it and the wall is
stronger than you thought. It kind of hurts your

2175
02:49:36,126 --> 02:49:37,502
knuckles at the impact.

2176
02:49:37,502 --> 02:49:38,680
MARISHA: The second one's a 19.

2177
02:49:38,680 --> 02:49:40,459
MATT: Yeah, go ahead and roll damage for the
second strike.

2178
02:49:40,459 --> 02:49:47,790
MARISHA: That is 22 points total.

2179
02:49:47,790 --> 02:49:53,439
MATT: You slam into the wall and rocks break and
shoot forward. This section of the wall now is

2180
02:49:53,439 --> 02:50:00,897
currently visible through. You can travel past or
see through it. Percy and Pike, you look behind

2181
02:50:00,897 --> 02:50:05,650
you as you hear the slamming of rock and you can
see part of the wall slam forward, and behind it a

2182
02:50:05,650 --> 02:50:09,723
very angry earth elemental. I'm going to go ahead
and mark that as an open part of the wall. You can

2183
02:50:09,723 --> 02:50:11,649
still move, or do you want to stay there?

2184
02:50:11,649 --> 02:50:19,924
MARISHA: I want to back up, just kind of tuck a
bit.

2185
02:50:19,924 --> 02:50:24,273
MATT: Into that area? You're still scooting over
the marbles, but you made your check this turn.

2186
02:50:24,273 --> 02:50:31,919
You pull back and this area is still pretty bad
for you. That finishes Keyleth's turn. Percy,

2187
02:50:31,919 --> 02:50:33,094
you're up.

2188
02:50:33,094 --> 02:50:39,411
TALIESIN: All right. I'm putting Bad News aside
and pulling out my sword, and I'm going to start

2189
02:50:39,411 --> 02:50:52,208
hacking away at the cleric. I'm cutting at the
cleric, like we do. Slash number one. 16.

2190
02:50:52,208 --> 02:51:04,776
MATT: (clang) Across her armor. Her thick, armored
exterior deflects the blow. The blade doesn't make

2191
02:51:04,776 --> 02:51:06,689
any sort of impact or wound.

2192
02:51:06,689 --> 02:51:10,335
TALIESIN: 21.

2193
02:51:10,335 --> 02:51:11,813
MATT: What's your AC right now?

2194
02:51:11,813 --> 02:51:12,855
ASHLEY: 22.

2195
02:51:12,855 --> 02:51:18,705
TALIESIN: God damn it. Ah, 23.

2196
02:51:18,705 --> 02:51:20,081
ASHLEY: There you go.

2197
02:51:20,081 --> 02:51:25,804
MATT: All right, that hits. Roll your damage. I've
been forgetting the concentration checks for your

2198
02:51:25,804 --> 02:51:29,194
spell that you had on giving you the AC bonus.
It's fine, we'll do it now.

2199
02:51:29,194 --> 02:51:33,783
TALIESIN: And that's nine points of slashing
damage.

2200
02:51:33,783 --> 02:51:36,330
ASHLEY: I'll take it.

2201
02:51:36,330 --> 02:51:41,421
MATT: Go ahead and roll a constitution check. Just
roll a d20 and add your constitution modifier.

2202
02:51:41,421 --> 02:51:46,490
ASHLEY: Nine.

2203
02:51:46,490 --> 02:51:55,739
MATT: Total nine? You lose your plus two AC bonus
spell. So your AC is now naturally the 20

2204
02:51:55,739 --> 02:52:01,189
normally. That ends your turn, Percy? Pike, you're
up.

2205
02:52:01,189 --> 02:52:08,840
PIKE: I have a sword, too. I'm going to take out
my Frostbrand. Time to melee.

2206
02:52:08,840 --> 02:52:11,274
MATT: Go ahead and roll a physical attack against
Percy.

2207
02:52:11,274 --> 02:52:17,796
ASHLEY: 23.

2208
02:52:17,796 --> 02:52:20,103
MATT: 23 I believe hits against your armor class,
right?

2209
02:52:20,103 --> 02:52:22,027
PERCY: Yes, it does.

2210
02:52:22,027 --> 02:52:27,143
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage. It's a d6 because
it's a shortsword, an extra d6 of cold damage, and

2211
02:52:27,143 --> 02:52:35,139
an extra d8 of-- sorry, 3d6 is what it is. No,
it's an extra d8, I think. Let me go check. The

2212
02:52:35,139 --> 02:52:38,194
war cleric bonus, you don't do a lot of melee.
Pardon me, folks.

2213
02:52:38,194 --> 02:52:41,986
ASHLEY: No, I think I have the d8 for the mace.

2214
02:52:41,986 --> 02:52:49,530
MATT: Right, but because you're war-based, you
have Divine Strike, it's an extra d8. So 2d6 plus

2215
02:52:49,530 --> 02:52:52,776
1d8. There we go. My apologies.

2216
02:52:52,776 --> 02:53:03,467
ASHLEY: 17 points of damage.

2217
02:53:03,467 --> 02:53:08,926
MATT: Pike reaches back and slams into you with
the Frostbrand. The cut of the blade is hard

2218
02:53:08,926 --> 02:53:12,584
enough, but the cold enchantment on it causes the
wound itself to seal with ice.

2219
02:53:12,584 --> 02:53:21,447
TALIESIN: Wow, I'm looking rough.

2220
02:53:21,447 --> 02:53:27,232
MATT: Anything else you want to do, Pike? You have
your bonus action still, and your movement if you

2221
02:53:27,232 --> 02:53:29,352
wanted to try to move away. It's up to you.

2222
02:53:29,352 --> 02:53:32,679
PIKE: I'm going to cast Shield of Faith on myself
again, can I do that?

2223
02:53:32,679 --> 02:53:36,807
MATT: You just used your action. Shield of Faith
is a bonus action? Then yeah, you can.

2224
02:53:36,807 --> 02:53:38,703
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll cast Shield of Faith on
myself.

2225
02:53:38,703 --> 02:53:44,792
MATT: So with that, your radiant field of
protective energy begins to shimmer across your

2226
02:53:44,792 --> 02:53:48,796
upper torso again, helping to improve your armor
class. Are you going to stay where you are, or are

2227
02:53:48,796 --> 02:53:50,504
you going to move?

2228
02:53:50,504 --> 02:53:58,125
ASHLEY: I can move ten feet? Oh, I haven't even
moved yet. I'm going to go back behind the wall.

2229
02:53:58,125 --> 02:53:59,565
MATT: This way?

2230
02:53:59,565 --> 02:54:01,238
ASHLEY: Yeah, tuck into there.

2231
02:54:01,238 --> 02:54:02,929
TALIESIN: I'm going to take my slashing attack.

2232
02:54:02,929 --> 02:54:04,861
MATT: You do get your attack of opportunity
against her.

2233
02:54:04,861 --> 02:54:09,072
TALIESIN: That hit. That's a 31.

2234
02:54:09,072 --> 02:54:10,838
MATT: So roll damage.

2235
02:54:10,838 --> 02:54:15,596
TALIESIN: That's ten points of slashing damage.

2236
02:54:15,596 --> 02:54:19,499
MATT: Ten points of slashing damage against you,
Pike. As you back away, Percy gets one strike with

2237
02:54:19,499 --> 02:54:26,129
the weapon as you turn around the corner. All
right, that ends your turn. Vax, you're up.

2238
02:54:26,129 --> 02:54:28,482
LIAM: Oh, jeez, okay.

2239
02:54:28,482 --> 02:54:34,088
MATT: Oh, Vax, real fast, I need you to go ahead
and make a dexterity saving throw.

2240
02:54:34,088 --> 02:54:43,522
LIAM: I have advantage because of the boots.
Dexterity? 17.

2241
02:54:43,522 --> 02:54:52,099
MATT: That is not going to work. You take 20
points of radiant damage as a guardian in this

2242
02:54:52,099 --> 02:54:53,429
vicinity all of a sudden--

2243
02:54:53,429 --> 02:54:55,081
LIAM: Well, I use evasion.

2244
02:54:55,081 --> 02:54:59,061
MATT: So you take half damage. You take ten points
of radiant damage as you rush by. All of a sudden,

2245
02:54:59,061 --> 02:55:03,427
an unseen guardian of energy comes forming out of
the wall and slams into you as you pass.

2246
02:55:03,427 --> 02:55:08,237
LIAM: Pass what? What do I pass? I didn't even
move yet.

2247
02:55:08,237 --> 02:55:12,022
MATT: Yeah, you did. This technically would have
happened last turn. Yeah, because I forgot it last

2248
02:55:12,022 --> 02:55:14,725
turn. So it's another ten damage. Mark that.

2249
02:55:14,725 --> 02:55:16,177
TALIESIN: Does that drop stealth?

2250
02:55:16,177 --> 02:55:19,313
MATT: No, it's just damage.

2251
02:55:19,313 --> 02:55:23,222
ASHLEY: Is that the only damage you've taken this
game?

2252
02:55:23,222 --> 02:55:31,109
LIAM: Yes, and Vax reappears right here, on the
move, and I am throwing a dagger right at Percy's forehead.

2253
02:55:31,109 --> 02:55:44,025
MATT: Okay. 24? All right. Percy, what's your AC?

2254
02:55:44,025 --> 02:55:50,867
TALIESIN: My AC is 18, yeah.

2255
02:55:50,867 --> 02:55:55,255
MATT: All right, so that's a hit. A dagger comes
out of nowhere as you look over just in time to

2256
02:55:55,255 --> 02:55:57,209
see it coming at you, you're going to go ahead
and--

2257
02:55:57,209 --> 02:55:58,554
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to do a catch.

2258
02:55:58,554 --> 02:56:05,099
MATT: All right, go ahead and attempt to Missile
Snare. Well no, it's a reaction to do it, isn't it?

2259
02:56:05,099 --> 02:56:06,733
TALIESIN: It is a reaction.

2260
02:56:06,733 --> 02:56:09,099
MATT: You've already used your reaction to do that
attack of opportunity against Pike.

2261
02:56:09,099 --> 02:56:10,666
TALIESIN: Oh, does that burn my reaction?

2262
02:56:10,666 --> 02:56:14,157
MATT: Yeah. So, yeah, you don't have the reaction
to do it, unfortunately.

2263
02:56:14,157 --> 02:56:16,295
LIAM: 36.

2264
02:56:16,295 --> 02:56:18,164
MATT: 36 points of piercing damage against you.

2265
02:56:18,164 --> 02:56:19,387
TALIESIN: No, I'm done.

2266
02:56:19,387 --> 02:56:23,054
MATT: With that, Percy, you fall to the ground,
the dagger sticking out of the side of your neck.

2267
02:56:23,054 --> 02:56:28,553
You are currently-- Pinned you to the wall?

2268
02:56:28,553 --> 02:56:29,942
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm out.

2269
02:56:29,942 --> 02:56:33,683
MATT: We'll say as you fall back the blade takes
you and pins you against the wall. You are

2270
02:56:33,683 --> 02:56:36,334
(dying sound) eyes roll back closed.

2271
02:56:36,334 --> 02:56:39,537
TALIESIN: I rolled a lot of ones and twos this
fight.

2272
02:56:39,537 --> 02:56:43,366
MARISHA: You rolled a fuckton, and twos and
threes!

2273
02:56:43,366 --> 02:56:48,011
LIAM: So, what I'd like to do, because I didn't
even stop moving, is use my bonus action to kinda

2274
02:56:48,011 --> 02:56:54,511
dive this way and hide here, right on top of
Percival's body.

2275
02:56:54,511 --> 02:56:56,616
ASHLEY: Are we allowed to loot the body?

2276
02:56:56,616 --> 02:56:59,051
MATT: I mean, you could.

2277
02:56:59,051 --> 02:57:02,579
LIAM: So I'm going to roll for stealth.

2278
02:57:02,579 --> 02:57:05,614
MARISHA: Being the person who died first last
time, I know it sucks.

2279
02:57:05,614 --> 02:57:07,038
TALIESIN: No, I was prepared.

2280
02:57:07,038 --> 02:57:09,792
MARISHA: At least it wasn't a Finger of Death like
five minutes in.

2281
02:57:09,792 --> 02:57:13,030
MATT: All right. Pike, I need you to go ahead and
roll a perception check.

2282
02:57:13,030 --> 02:57:26,791
ASHLEY: Okay. 12. Or wait, hold on. 13.

2283
02:57:26,791 --> 02:57:32,290
MATT: 13, okay, yeah, you see a flash as Vax runs
past you and then disappears around the corner.

2284
02:57:32,290 --> 02:57:41,335
LIAM: Okay, and I'm going to run to-- hold on,
I'll tell you where I'm going to run to.

2285
02:57:41,335 --> 02:57:55,733
MATT: All righty. So, with that, it is Keyleth's
turn. You sensed Vax run this way and then vanish

2286
02:57:55,733 --> 02:58:00,801
from your current visual range of tremor sense.

2287
02:58:00,801 --> 02:58:04,791
MARISHA: Okay, I want to very carefully step
forward here.

2288
02:58:04,791 --> 02:58:09,147
MATT: Yep, go ahead and make another dexterity
saving throw.

2289
02:58:09,147 --> 02:58:10,979
MARISHA: Ooh, yeah, 15.

2290
02:58:10,979 --> 02:58:13,532
MATT: Yeah, you manage to just scoot past him
again without falling over.

2291
02:58:13,532 --> 02:58:16,598
MARISHA: Can I sense Vax again, or anybody else
for that matter?

2292
02:58:16,598 --> 02:58:18,027
LIAM: Not moving.

2293
02:58:18,027 --> 02:58:24,968
MATT: You would have sensed Vax actually moving
last round even then, because you didn't move that

2294
02:58:24,968 --> 02:58:27,177
far. You do know where he is.

2295
02:58:27,177 --> 02:58:28,201
MARISHA: Yeah.

2296
02:58:28,201 --> 02:58:40,926
TALIESIN: Well done, no, you took, yeah. You did
some intense damage.

2297
02:58:40,926 --> 02:58:43,140
ASHLEY: Aw, sorry, Percy.

2298
02:58:43,140 --> 02:58:45,622
TALIESIN: It's okay. That was awesome.

2299
02:58:45,622 --> 02:58:50,748
ASHLEY: (sighs) Sucks. I don't know if I like
this.

2300
02:58:50,748 --> 02:58:52,840
TALIESIN: Aww.

2301
02:58:52,840 --> 02:58:54,531
ASHLEY: You're my friends!

2302
02:58:54,531 --> 02:58:56,924
MARISHA: "You're my friends!"

2303
02:58:56,924 --> 02:59:01,914
LIAM: Remember all that time out on the ocean,
worrying about Percy, was he okay? How is his soul?

2304
02:59:01,914 --> 02:59:06,739
TALIESIN: I only feel that that's fair.

2305
02:59:06,739 --> 02:59:09,126
MATT: What are you doing, Keyleth?

2306
02:59:09,126 --> 02:59:12,287
MARISHA: I want to drop my earth elemental form.

2307
02:59:12,287 --> 02:59:24,113
MATT: Okay. You can see through this wall still. I
mean, you still remember where he was, but your

2308
02:59:24,113 --> 02:59:26,034
tremor sense is no longer there, so you have to--

2309
02:59:26,034 --> 02:59:42,802
MARISHA: Kind of guess. Well, guessing, I want to
do a Flaming Sphere.

2310
02:59:42,802 --> 02:59:46,036
MATT: Flaming Sphere?

2311
02:59:46,036 --> 02:59:52,205
MARISHA: Doing it 4th-level, why not? Wait, I need
to-- I'm trying to keep track of two different sets

2312
02:59:52,205 --> 02:59:56,192
here, from my real game and from this fake game.

2313
02:59:56,192 --> 02:59:57,986
MATT: Okay, where is Flaming Sphere going to go?

2314
02:59:57,986 --> 02:59:59,459
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, I should probably kill me.

2315
02:59:59,459 --> 03:00:03,492
MARISHA: Sorry, sorry, sorry.

2316
03:00:03,492 --> 03:00:10,051
MATT: You're still not dead yet, you're
unconscious. If you manage to-- which happened in

2317
03:00:10,114 --> 03:00:14,068
our last battle royale-- roll a natural 20 on a
death saving throw, you come back to

2318
03:00:14,068 --> 03:00:24,313
consciousness. So Flaming Sphere at 4th level?

2319
03:00:24,313 --> 03:00:25,711
MARISHA: Correct.

2320
03:00:25,711 --> 03:00:28,429
MATT: That means you'll be doing 4d6 fire damage.

2321
03:00:28,429 --> 03:00:31,769
MARISHA: 60-foot range, 4d6?

2322
03:00:31,769 --> 03:00:33,392
MATT: Where are you putting it?

2323
03:00:33,392 --> 03:00:36,303
MARISHA: I want to go (explosion) in this corner.

2324
03:00:36,303 --> 03:00:39,043
MATT: Okay, right there, or right on there?

2325
03:00:39,043 --> 03:00:41,006
MARISHA: How big is it?

2326
03:00:41,006 --> 03:00:43,317
MATT: It's a five-foot diameter sphere, that's how
big it is.

2327
03:00:43,317 --> 03:00:49,053
MARISHA: Oh, it's only a five-foot diameter? I'm
guessing there.

2328
03:00:49,053 --> 03:00:54,818
MATT: Okay. Bright light shines in the area, and
from your visual perspective, you show up because

2329
03:00:54,818 --> 03:00:59,250
of where you are. Where's your figure?

2330
03:00:59,250 --> 03:01:10,668
LIAM: Sorry. Where'd you go, buddy? I'm around.
Oh, there he is. I was sitting on Percy.

2331
03:01:10,668 --> 03:01:24,969
MATT: The Flaming Sphere appears. So that's your
action, and as a bonus action, you can move the

2332
03:01:24,969 --> 03:01:29,206
sphere up to 30 feet if you wanted to, to ram it
into something.

2333
03:01:29,206 --> 03:01:33,061
MARISHA: Sure, I'll ram it into Vax now that I can
see him.

2334
03:01:33,061 --> 03:01:34,599
LIAM: Evasion.

2335
03:01:34,599 --> 03:01:38,480
MATT: The sphere starts slamming into you. Make a
dexterity saving throw.

2336
03:01:38,480 --> 03:01:39,932
LIAM: I get advantage because of the boots.

2337
03:01:39,932 --> 03:01:41,369
MATT: You do.

2338
03:01:41,369 --> 03:01:47,555
LIAM: That is a 26.

2339
03:01:47,555 --> 03:01:57,562
MATT: 26. Unfortunately, he dodges out of the
sphere as it slams into the wall. Percy, you take

2340
03:01:57,562 --> 03:02:03,692
a death saving throw automatically as the Flaming
Sphere rolls over your current unconscious body,

2341
03:02:03,692 --> 03:02:05,247
pinned against the wall.

2342
03:02:05,247 --> 03:02:08,811
TALIESIN: Okay, so I lose a death saving throw?
I'm one down?

2343
03:02:08,811 --> 03:02:10,306
MATT: Yeah, you do. You're one down.

2344
03:02:10,306 --> 03:02:11,834
LIAM: Thanks for dropping earth elemental.

2345
03:02:11,834 --> 03:02:15,226
MARISHA: Uh-huh. And I'm going to tuck behind this
wall and see if I can hide.

2346
03:02:15,226 --> 03:02:18,712
MATT: Well, you can't hide, you used your action.

2347
03:02:18,712 --> 03:02:20,908
MARISHA: I'll tuck behind the wall at least.

2348
03:02:20,908 --> 03:02:26,855
MATT: Okay, so there you are behind the wall.
Ending your turn, Keyleth. Percy, roll another

2349
03:02:26,855 --> 03:02:27,931
death saving throw.

2350
03:02:27,931 --> 03:02:29,063
LIAM: (high-pitched) What about the marbles?

2351
03:02:29,063 --> 03:02:30,270
MATT: No, she's already made her roll this turn.

2352
03:02:30,270 --> 03:02:32,961
TALIESIN: Under over ten?

2353
03:02:32,961 --> 03:02:38,646
MATT: Ten or higher is what you want.

2354
03:02:38,646 --> 03:02:40,398
TALIESIN: Nope.

2355
03:02:40,398 --> 03:02:44,200
MATT: That's a second death saving throw. You're
down two.

2356
03:02:44,200 --> 03:02:46,788
TALIESIN: That was like, "I rolled another
three."

2357
03:02:46,788 --> 03:02:52,807
MATT: Pike, you're up. You see this burst of flame
and around the corner, you see a very visible Vax,

2358
03:02:52,807 --> 03:02:56,889
just out of the corner of your eye, dodge the
fire.

2359
03:02:56,889 --> 03:03:02,905
ASHLEY: Oh, hi Vax. Oh boy, now I can see him.

2360
03:03:02,905 --> 03:03:04,881
MATT: Yeah, this is the one time you will.

2361
03:03:04,881 --> 03:03:06,526
LIAM: (hissing)

2362
03:03:06,526 --> 03:03:13,567
ASHLEY: Shit, okay. That changes what I was going
to do.

2363
03:03:13,567 --> 03:03:16,014
LIAM: (Gollum voice) Nasty cleric.

2364
03:03:16,014 --> 03:03:23,096
ASHLEY: I am going to cast Flame Strike at him.

2365
03:03:23,096 --> 03:03:25,555
MARISHA: All the fire!

2366
03:03:25,555 --> 03:03:28,554
ASHLEY: All the fire, all the rage!

2367
03:03:28,554 --> 03:03:34,604
MATT: All right, with Flame Strike, suddenly, fire
and divine light come bursting up in a column

2368
03:03:34,604 --> 03:03:46,943
around you up to the ceiling in a horrible spray
of flame. I need you to make a dexterity saving throw.

2369
03:03:46,943 --> 03:03:54,785
LIAM: Advantage. Not good. Really bad, 13.

2370
03:03:54,785 --> 03:04:06,654
MATT: No. That's 8d6 fire damage and 8d6 radiant--
sorry, 4d6 fire, 4d6 radiant. So yeah, 8d6 points

2371
03:04:06,654 --> 03:04:11,091
of damage. And Percy incinerates, his body is
turned to ash.

2372
03:04:11,169 --> 03:04:14,591
ASHLEY: Oh no.

2373
03:04:14,591 --> 03:04:21,972
LIAM: Did I say what the armor was? What did I set
my armor to?

2374
03:04:21,972 --> 03:04:23,561
MATT: You set it to necrotic.

2375
03:04:23,561 --> 03:04:27,462
LIAM: Yes. Aw, balls. That could've been so
accidentally good!

2376
03:04:27,462 --> 03:04:40,241
MATT: I know, but you said necrotic. So you take
half damage of whatever this is. (chuckles)

2377
03:04:40,241 --> 03:04:42,196
Hashtag no mercy for Percy!

2378
03:04:42,196 --> 03:04:44,747
(laughter)

2379
03:04:44,747 --> 03:04:45,711
ASHLEY: 21.

2380
03:04:45,711 --> 03:04:47,125
MATT: 21 points of damage to you.

2381
03:04:47,125 --> 03:04:48,374
LIAM: Is the halved version of that.

2382
03:04:48,374 --> 03:04:52,331
ASHLEY: No, that's the full. Yeah, I had some bad
rolls.

2383
03:04:52,331 --> 03:05:07,900
MATT: You take ten points of damage. You can still
move if you want, you have not moved yet.

2384
03:05:07,900 --> 03:05:31,714
ASHLEY: Okay, so I just used a 5th-level to deal
ten points of damage. And I'm going to do Healing

2385
03:05:31,714 --> 03:05:35,767
Word on myself at 2nd-level.

2386
03:05:35,767 --> 03:05:48,156
MATT: 2nd-level? So 2d4 plus five. Nice! So 12
points of healing to you. And you want to move as well?

2387
03:05:48,156 --> 03:05:53,548
ASHLEY: I'm going to stand directly behind the
pole.

2388
03:05:53,548 --> 03:05:57,901
MATT: Over here? There?

2389
03:05:57,901 --> 03:05:59,484
ASHLEY: Oh shit, but then she can see me.

2390
03:05:59,484 --> 03:06:03,218
MATT: She can.

2391
03:06:03,218 --> 03:06:05,677
ASHLEY: Can I stay where I was?

2392
03:06:05,677 --> 03:06:06,650
MATT: Where you were? Yeah.

2393
03:06:06,650 --> 03:06:07,841
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm just going to stay there.

2394
03:06:07,841 --> 03:06:12,166
MATT: Okay, using the light of Sarenrae to
hopefully guide you. That ends your turn, Pike.

2395
03:06:12,166 --> 03:06:13,434
Vax, you're up.

2396
03:06:13,434 --> 03:06:19,878
LIAM: She lost line of sight of me? Am I in this
little nook still on Percy's ashes? Looks like it.

2397
03:06:19,878 --> 03:06:24,319
MATT: Pike's hiding out, there's still a little
bit of line of sight on you, just on the edge

2398
03:06:24,319 --> 03:06:28,256
based on the square you are on. That's where his
corpse was on right now, and there's a big flaming

2399
03:06:28,256 --> 03:06:34,738
sphere that's also lighting up the area. There's
no real darkness there. Obscuring yourself is the

2400
03:06:34,738 --> 03:06:36,734
only way that would aid you.

2401
03:06:36,734 --> 03:06:54,928
LIAM: Now it gets interesting. I'm going to take
one step this way. Is this still burning?

2402
03:06:54,928 --> 03:06:57,245
MATT: Yeah, it's chilling there, burning on this
side.

2403
03:06:57,245 --> 03:07:04,679
LIAM: I'm going to throw a regular,
non-sneak-attack dagger at Pike. Terrible.

2404
03:07:04,679 --> 03:07:11,239
MATT: As you pull back, you see Vax pop around the
corner, throw a dagger, and it streaks off your

2405
03:07:11,239 --> 03:07:13,142
shield and you knock it out of the way.

2406
03:07:13,142 --> 03:07:15,137
LIAM: This is broken, right, this is gone?

2407
03:07:15,137 --> 03:07:17,102
MATT: Yes, you can see through this part of the
wall right there.

2408
03:07:17,102 --> 03:07:18,464
LIAM: Is this wall here?

2409
03:07:18,464 --> 03:07:19,645
MATT: That wall is still there.

2410
03:07:19,645 --> 03:07:26,633
LIAM: Okay, so what I want to do is use my
movement to tuck in here, press into the wall, go

2411
03:07:26,633 --> 03:07:35,350
stealth. That's good, that is 28.

2412
03:07:35,350 --> 03:07:42,426
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a perception check,
Pike.

2413
03:07:42,426 --> 03:07:51,437
ASHLEY: 19. Shit.

2414
03:07:51,437 --> 03:07:55,885
MATT: You have no idea where Vax is. Vax has
essentially vanished from view.

2415
03:07:55,885 --> 03:07:57,835
ASHLEY: What in the heck?

2416
03:07:57,835 --> 03:08:02,019
LIAM: I'll tell you where I'm going. I'm going to
run to here.

2417
03:08:02,019 --> 03:08:07,479
TALIESIN: Keyleth incinerates the entire cave.

2418
03:08:07,479 --> 03:08:11,343
MATT: Finishing that turn, comes to Keyleth.

2419
03:08:11,343 --> 03:08:17,335
MARISHA: Fucking fuck. I have no idea where Vax
is, do I?

2420
03:08:17,335 --> 03:08:22,339
MATT: Nope. You hid to keep out of the view of
everything. To be fair, currently Vax has no idea

2421
03:08:22,339 --> 03:08:23,860
where you are either.

2422
03:08:23,860 --> 03:08:37,650
MARISHA: Right. If I peek around this wall, can I
see Pike?

2423
03:08:37,650 --> 03:08:40,893
MATT: If you peek around right now, you can go and
look, if you want to.

2424
03:08:40,893 --> 03:08:41,602
MARISHA: Yeah.

2425
03:08:41,602 --> 03:08:44,275
MATT: Okay, as you peek around the corner, Pike is
currently not visible.

2426
03:08:44,275 --> 03:08:48,323
MARISHA: So no one's visible? Whatsoever?

2427
03:08:48,323 --> 03:08:49,371
MATT: Nope.

2428
03:08:49,371 --> 03:08:54,460
LIAM: Can I ask a quick question? When I put those
marbles down, it went (marbles rolling), right? A

2429
03:08:54,460 --> 03:08:59,350
non-rogue leaping over this, we'd all hear that,
right?

2430
03:08:59,350 --> 03:09:02,850
MATT: A non-rogue leaping over there? Probably.

2431
03:09:02,850 --> 03:09:04,310
LIAM: Unless they tried to make a stealth move.

2432
03:09:04,310 --> 03:09:09,423
MATT: Yeah, you make noise when you run anyway,
regardless. Only a stealthy character who's

2433
03:09:09,423 --> 03:09:11,180
already hidden that it would be a thing.

2434
03:09:11,180 --> 03:09:12,605
LIAM: Understood.

2435
03:09:12,605 --> 03:09:33,289
MARISHA: I still have my Sphere up. I don't know
where anyone is. Fucking fuck.

2436
03:09:33,289 --> 03:09:38,572
MATT: What do you got, Keyleth?

2437
03:09:38,572 --> 03:09:43,861
MARISHA: I don't know what I would do aside from
something defensive at this point.

2438
03:09:43,861 --> 03:09:55,274
MATT: Do you have any spells that cover an area
that are helpful? Like Faerie Fire, anything like that?

2439
03:09:55,274 --> 03:10:00,826
MARISHA: I didn't take Faerie Fire today.

2440
03:10:00,826 --> 03:10:07,219
MATT: Rough call against a rogue, that would have
been clutch. But now you know for the future. Just

2441
03:10:07,219 --> 03:10:08,441
letting you know.

2442
03:10:08,441 --> 03:10:09,646
LIAM: Tremor sense was good, though.

2443
03:10:09,646 --> 03:10:11,174
MATT: It was very good.

2444
03:10:11,174 --> 03:10:26,323
MARISHA: Let me go ahead-- I do have Sleet Storm
that I learned. I think it's just an instant, let

2445
03:10:26,323 --> 03:10:27,692
me see really quick.

2446
03:10:27,692 --> 03:10:32,335
MATT: Sleet Storm's an action.

2447
03:10:32,335 --> 03:10:36,435
MARISHA: 20-foot-tall cylinder.

2448
03:10:36,435 --> 03:10:39,198
MATT: With a 40-foot radius centered at a point
you choose within range.

2449
03:10:39,198 --> 03:10:44,839
MARISHA: 40-foot radius, 20-foot tall, 150-foot
range.

2450
03:10:44,839 --> 03:10:51,214
MATT: Yep. Where do you want to place it?

2451
03:10:51,214 --> 03:10:53,600
MARISHA: Last I saw Vax was over here?

2452
03:10:53,600 --> 03:10:54,991
MATT: You saw him in this area.

2453
03:10:54,991 --> 03:10:58,364
MARISHA: I'm going to do here.

2454
03:10:58,364 --> 03:10:59,968
MATT: Centered from where?

2455
03:10:59,968 --> 03:11:01,940
MARISHA: Here?

2456
03:11:01,940 --> 03:11:06,977
MATT: Centering it from there will only get this
section. If you center it further out, you'll hit

2457
03:11:06,977 --> 03:11:09,289
more of an area, just so you know from a tactical
standpoint.

2458
03:11:09,289 --> 03:11:11,492
MARISHA: I kind of want to get Pike.

2459
03:11:11,492 --> 03:11:16,083
MATT: It's a 40-foot radius, it's going to hit
everything.

2460
03:11:16,083 --> 03:11:20,700
MARISHA: Well then, sure, let's do-- what's this?
(counting)

2461
03:11:20,700 --> 03:11:24,470
MATT: Know that the radius is very big on this, so
before you put it too close to a wall, you can

2462
03:11:24,470 --> 03:11:25,888
have more space.

2463
03:11:25,888 --> 03:11:34,623
MARISHA: Let's do here-ish.

2464
03:11:34,623 --> 03:11:43,380
MATT: Flaming Sphere drops. All right, so the
center is where?

2465
03:11:43,380 --> 03:11:47,124
MARISHA: (counting) Yeah, it's right here.

2466
03:11:47,124 --> 03:11:51,995
MATT: That is the center of your Sleet Storm.
Suddenly, out of nowhere, a burst of freezing rain

2467
03:11:51,995 --> 03:11:57,266
and sleet starts spilling out of the sky, conjured
from this temporal portal that pulls from some

2468
03:11:57,266 --> 03:12:03,828
distant elemental dimension. As it hits the
ground, a lot of the lava begins to cool and

2469
03:12:03,828 --> 03:12:08,574
darken in certain areas. This area begins to cool
a little bit. Not entirely, but it's beginning to

2470
03:12:08,574 --> 03:12:11,020
fight against the cold temperature.

2471
03:12:11,020 --> 03:12:17,472
MARISHA: Anything in that area has to make a
dexterity saving throw.

2472
03:12:17,472 --> 03:12:19,122
MATT: At the start of its turn, yep.

2473
03:12:19,122 --> 03:12:24,046
MARISHA: Or make a spell save DC or lose your
concentration as well.

2474
03:12:24,046 --> 03:12:29,376
MATT: That's true. Is that your action? And do you
move anywhere, or do you stay where you are?

2475
03:12:29,376 --> 03:12:30,948
MARISHA: Can I tuck back against the wall?

2476
03:12:30,948 --> 03:12:37,752
MATT: Yeah, you tuck back against the wall. There
you are. So, that brings us to-- no longer Percy,

2477
03:12:37,752 --> 03:12:45,009
Percy is gone. Sorry buddy, crossing you off
there. Pike, your turn begins. This sleet and rain

2478
03:12:45,009 --> 03:12:47,427
is hitting you from all over the place. I need you
to make a dexterity saving throw.

2479
03:12:47,427 --> 03:12:50,576
LIAM: Percy was the fan favorite all day.

2480
03:12:50,576 --> 03:12:56,433
TALIESIN: Was it? Well, my money was on either you
or me dying first.

2481
03:12:56,433 --> 03:12:58,253
LIAM: Mine too.

2482
03:12:58,253 --> 03:13:00,558
(laughter)

2483
03:13:00,558 --> 03:13:01,736
ASHLEY: Eight.

2484
03:13:01,736 --> 03:13:06,763
MATT: Eight? You immediately fall prone as the
slick ice causes you to fall to the ground, which

2485
03:13:06,763 --> 03:13:11,883
means it'll take half your movement to stand up.
Not a huge deal. However, any spells you are

2486
03:13:11,883 --> 03:13:19,419
concentrating in, you have to make a successful
constitution saving throw. So make a constitution

2487
03:13:19,419 --> 03:13:20,883
saving throw.

2488
03:13:20,883 --> 03:13:23,642
ASHLEY: Ooh, that's a natural one.

2489
03:13:23,642 --> 03:13:31,820
MATT: You lose your armor spell again, so you're
back down to an AC of 20. Pike, now's your turn.

2490
03:13:31,820 --> 03:13:42,937
ASHLEY: Okay, that changes what I was going to do.
I will stand up.

2491
03:13:42,937 --> 03:13:48,175
MATT: Okay, you have ten more feet to move, so two
more squares if you wanted to.

2492
03:13:48,175 --> 03:13:57,365
ASHLEY: I am not going to move. I am going to
create a Magic Circle around myself. And I am

2493
03:13:57,365 --> 03:13:58,778
going to...

2494
03:13:58,778 --> 03:14:06,773
MATT: Magic Circle is a one-minute casting time.
That will take you ten rounds to cast.

2495
03:14:06,773 --> 03:14:10,275
ASHLEY: Never mind. Oh, it <i>is</i> one minute!

2496
03:14:10,275 --> 03:14:12,065
MATT: Yeah, sorry, girl.

2497
03:14:12,065 --> 03:14:19,837
ASHLEY: Sorry, that's why I made a last-minute
decision. Okay, you know what? I'm just going to

2498
03:14:19,837 --> 03:14:25,591
stay there and I'm going to cast Spirit
Guardians.

2499
03:14:25,591 --> 03:14:28,127
MATT: Spirit Guardians?

2500
03:14:28,127 --> 03:14:30,033
ASHLEY: Yeah, around myself.

2501
03:14:30,033 --> 03:14:34,650
MATT: At what level?

2502
03:14:34,650 --> 03:14:36,090
ASHLEY: Third.

2503
03:14:36,090 --> 03:14:38,745
MATT: Which is the basic level.

2504
03:14:38,745 --> 03:14:42,703
ASHLEY: Sorry, fourth level.

2505
03:14:42,703 --> 03:14:57,872
MATT: All of a sudden, there is another entity
that has swirled around you. This spectral image

2506
03:14:57,872 --> 03:15:05,216
of Sarenrae is now looming over Pike's form, just
waiting. Ending Pike's turn, now up to Vax.

2507
03:15:05,216 --> 03:15:06,844
ASHLEY: I can't do anything else, right?

2508
03:15:06,844 --> 03:15:10,866
MATT: You have your bonus still, if you wanted to
do that.

2509
03:15:10,866 --> 03:15:12,648
ASHLEY: I'm going to do Shield of Faith again.

2510
03:15:12,648 --> 03:15:15,693
MATT: As a bonus action? That's two concentration
spells at once, you'll lose Spirit Guardians.

2511
03:15:15,693 --> 03:15:17,282
Yeah, sorry.

2512
03:15:17,282 --> 03:15:24,560
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. I'll do a Healing Word
again.

2513
03:15:24,560 --> 03:15:33,483
MATT: Okay. So heal seven. That brings us to Vax.
What are you doing, buddy?

2514
03:15:33,483 --> 03:15:44,396
LIAM: I would like to pop back into existence
right here. And throw a dagger--

2515
03:15:44,396 --> 03:15:48,875
MATT: Technically she's inside this area there.
She's tucked against the wall much like how you

2516
03:15:48,875 --> 03:15:50,232
were tucked against the wall there.

2517
03:15:50,232 --> 03:15:52,118
LIAM: I wouldn't have revealed myself if I had
known that.

2518
03:15:52,118 --> 03:15:57,178
MATT: You know she's around there, but you'd
probably have to traverse--

2519
03:15:57,178 --> 03:15:59,270
LIAM: I thought she was five feet that way, which
would have changed everything.

2520
03:15:59,270 --> 03:16:03,234
MATT: She'd be further spaced out from there.

2521
03:16:03,234 --> 03:16:08,512
LIAM: That's everything that I've been working on
for the last few minutes.

2522
03:16:08,512 --> 03:16:10,050
MATT: Sorry.

2523
03:16:10,050 --> 03:16:22,632
LIAM: Instead of that, because this is gone,
right?

2524
03:16:22,632 --> 03:16:23,888
MATT: Yes.

2525
03:16:23,888 --> 03:16:27,515
LIAM: Can I see her from here? All right, I'm
going to materialize--

2526
03:16:27,515 --> 03:16:30,137
MATT: However, at the start of your turn, I need
you to make a dexterity saving throw because of

2527
03:16:30,137 --> 03:16:31,536
the sleet around you.

2528
03:16:31,536 --> 03:16:36,925
LIAM: Sure. I have advantage, 11 or 11. What is
with me? 21.

2529
03:16:36,925 --> 03:16:40,271
MATT: 21. What's the DC on your spell, Keyleth?

2530
03:16:40,271 --> 03:16:42,051
MARISHA: Is it versus my spell DC?

2531
03:16:42,051 --> 03:16:46,797
MATT: Yes it is. 19, yeah, so you save. You're
fine. No damage, no prone.

2532
03:16:46,797 --> 03:16:48,331
LIAM: Through the ice, through the snow.

2533
03:16:48,331 --> 03:16:54,699
MATT: This wall's open.

2534
03:16:54,699 --> 03:16:56,394
LIAM: I have sharpshooter, so does--?

2535
03:16:56,394 --> 03:16:57,983
MATT: Yeah, so she would have no cover on this.

2536
03:16:57,983 --> 03:16:59,682
LIAM: 21?

2537
03:16:59,682 --> 03:17:03,553
MATT: 21, is that your AC? With that, sneak attack
damage against Keyleth.

2538
03:17:03,553 --> 03:17:09,271
TALIESIN: Oh god, the pain begins.

2539
03:17:09,271 --> 03:17:17,597
LIAM: (counting) 33.

2540
03:17:17,597 --> 03:17:20,797
MATT: 33 points of piercing damage against you,
Keyleth. As the dagger hits you in the back of the

2541
03:17:20,797 --> 03:17:27,258
shoulder, you feel a sharp pain. It's weird being
on the opposing end of Vax's daggers.

2542
03:17:27,258 --> 03:17:35,949
LIAM: I'm going to dance back, use bonus action to
hide.

2543
03:17:35,949 --> 03:17:38,681
MATT: Make a stealth check.

2544
03:17:38,681 --> 03:17:42,330
LIAM: It's a 27.

2545
03:17:42,330 --> 03:17:45,057
MATT: Pike, I need you to roll a perception
check.

2546
03:17:45,057 --> 03:17:51,452
ASHLEY: Pfft, no. Not at all.

2547
03:17:51,452 --> 03:17:54,920
LIAM: And then my last action.

2548
03:17:54,920 --> 03:18:18,928
MATT: Okay. And with that, I need Vax to make a
dexterity saving throw.

2549
03:18:18,928 --> 03:18:27,153
LIAM: It's a 21.

2550
03:18:27,153 --> 03:18:37,324
MATT: 21. You manage to pull through the vicinity
without any impact. Ending Vax's turn, Keyleth,

2551
03:18:37,324 --> 03:18:38,784
you're up.

2552
03:18:38,784 --> 03:18:41,978
MARISHA: I still have the Sleet Storm up, right?

2553
03:18:41,978 --> 03:18:50,827
MATT: Mm-hmm. Although you do need to roll a
concentration for the attack against you, which

2554
03:18:50,827 --> 03:18:52,204
was thirty-what?

2555
03:18:52,204 --> 03:18:56,424
MARISHA: 30, right? Ooh, natural 19.

2556
03:18:56,424 --> 03:19:01,480
MATT: 19 would be more than half, you're fine. And
you maintain concentration. Half of that would

2557
03:19:01,480 --> 03:19:02,782
have been 16 or 17.

2558
03:19:02,782 --> 03:19:15,050
MARISHA: I just keep it up. Pike still hasn't
really moved, right? She's still in her same position.

2559
03:19:15,050 --> 03:19:17,549
MATT: Yeah, you don't see her. You haven't seen
her for a while.

2560
03:19:17,549 --> 03:19:24,949
MARISHA: Okay, I want to peer around this corner
and see if I can spot Vax.

2561
03:19:24,949 --> 03:19:31,493
MATT: Technically, also, Vax, once again, I need
you to make a wisdom saving throw as well.

2562
03:19:31,493 --> 03:19:39,700
LIAM: For why? So many things. Not my strong suit.
13.

2563
03:19:39,700 --> 03:19:48,763
MATT: 13. (chuckles) You take 3d8 radiant damage.

2564
03:19:48,763 --> 03:19:50,518
LIAM: It's a wisdom-based thing?

2565
03:19:50,518 --> 03:19:54,967
MATT: Yep, so go ahead and roll 3d8. As the spirit
guardian that's been looming over and can see over

2566
03:19:54,967 --> 03:20:00,440
the wall and that whole vicinity-- as you run
past, both of those spells blast at you. One of

2567
03:20:00,440 --> 03:20:04,417
them you manage to dodge, but the Sarenrae
guardian reaches out and slams a giant light blade

2568
03:20:04,417 --> 03:20:05,832
down into you.

2569
03:20:05,832 --> 03:20:08,845
MARISHA: Would I theoretically see that happening
through this wall crack?

2570
03:20:08,845 --> 03:20:10,734
MATT: No, because you're currently hiding behind
the wall.

2571
03:20:10,734 --> 03:20:12,136
LIAM: Is it a blade?

2572
03:20:12,136 --> 03:20:17,685
MATT: It is a blast of energy, but from a styling
standpoint, it's a--

2573
03:20:17,685 --> 03:20:19,471
LIAM: So no Uncanny Dodge for that?

2574
03:20:19,471 --> 03:20:23,941
MATT: You can Uncanny Dodge-- no, this is not a
spell attack against you, it just happens. So, no,

2575
03:20:23,941 --> 03:20:25,247
Uncanny Dodge would not help you on this.

2576
03:20:25,247 --> 03:20:26,954
LIAM: And it's not a dexterity save, so full hit.

2577
03:20:26,954 --> 03:20:29,509
ASHLEY: 12. Is it also the Guardian of Faith, or
no?

2578
03:20:29,509 --> 03:20:37,585
MATT: He already went through that and saved fine.
So you take 12 points of radiant damage. At the

2579
03:20:37,585 --> 03:20:40,986
end of your turn, now it's Keyleth, right?

2580
03:20:40,986 --> 03:20:47,442
MARISHA: Yeah, it's my turn. First, I want to peer
through the wall and see if I see Vax at all.

2581
03:20:47,442 --> 03:20:54,622
MATT: Make a perception check. Natural one!

2582
03:20:54,622 --> 03:20:58,194
MARISHA: So, since I don't see Vax--

2583
03:20:58,194 --> 03:21:03,577
TALIESIN: Not a lot of 20 in this game, is there?

2584
03:21:03,577 --> 03:21:05,892
MATT: Not yet, no.

2585
03:21:05,892 --> 03:21:07,073
MARISHA: Has there been a 20?

2586
03:21:07,073 --> 03:21:11,608
MATT: You did see some flashes of divine energy in
that vicinity, but that's all you see. Yeah. In

2587
03:21:11,608 --> 03:21:18,150
this general vicinity.

2588
03:21:18,150 --> 03:21:39,369
MARISHA: Okay. It's a decision on if I want to--
I'm afraid if I do a Fire Storm and if I mock out

2589
03:21:39,369 --> 03:21:45,798
to Pike, if that would be considered metagaming if
I knew where she is. Do I have an idea of where she is?

2590
03:21:45,798 --> 03:21:53,144
MATT: You haven't seen her for a while. It's up to
you, you can--

2591
03:21:53,144 --> 03:22:00,118
MARISHA: I don't want to be a dick, I don't want
to break the game. Let me-- I'll just leave up my

2592
03:22:00,118 --> 03:22:12,754
Sleet Storm, I guess. I'm going to do a Wall of
Stone spell, and I want to block off here. And can

2593
03:22:12,754 --> 03:22:15,443
I do another column to block off here?

2594
03:22:15,443 --> 03:22:18,516
MATT: Yeah, you have plenty of room there. You can
do all the way across there if you wanted to.

2595
03:22:18,516 --> 03:22:25,889
MARISHA: I want to leave a nice gap here, if I can.
Can I do that?

2596
03:22:25,889 --> 03:22:28,081
MATT: You can do that if you wanted to.

2597
03:22:28,081 --> 03:22:29,903
TALIESIN: Making yourself a private room.

2598
03:22:29,974 --> 03:22:34,589
MATT: However, it's a concentration-- no, we made
into an instant spell. The concentration made no

2599
03:22:34,589 --> 03:22:47,195
sense for Wall of Stone for older editions. That
being the case, we're looking at-- currently now,

2600
03:22:47,195 --> 03:22:55,856
stone wall's up here and stone wall's up here.

2601
03:22:55,856 --> 03:22:57,982
TALIESIN: He's in the room with you.

2602
03:22:57,982 --> 03:23:00,684
MARISHA: Is he in the room with me? I'm going to
be really upset if he's in the room with me.

2603
03:23:00,684 --> 03:23:06,000
MATT: You have no idea. All right, does that end
you turn, Keyleth? Keyleth, does that end your

2604
03:23:06,000 --> 03:23:09,536
turn? All right. Pike, you're up.

2605
03:23:09,536 --> 03:23:10,995
ASHLEY: Do I make a perception check?

2606
03:23:10,995 --> 03:23:13,254
MARISHA: Oh, and I tuck back against the wall.

2607
03:23:13,254 --> 03:23:19,664
MATT: Okay, you tuck against the wall. If you want
to go ahead and look around, yeah.

2608
03:23:19,664 --> 03:23:27,238
ASHLEY: Is this included in the turn, or will this
take away something that I was going to do? Or is

2609
03:23:27,238 --> 03:23:28,768
this just a perception check?

2610
03:23:28,768 --> 03:23:31,987
MATT: You've already made your perception check.
I'd say if you really wanted to honestly look for

2611
03:23:31,987 --> 03:23:33,819
him, I'd let you take an action to do it.

2612
03:23:33,819 --> 03:23:36,970
ASHLEY: I would have to roll a 20.

2613
03:23:36,970 --> 03:23:38,491
MATT: Yeah, you have no idea where he is right
now.

2614
03:23:38,491 --> 03:23:52,980
ASHLEY: Okay, you know what? I'm going to, since I
saw that the spirit guardian went off--

2615
03:23:52,980 --> 03:23:59,506
MATT: Yeah, you saw it go off around that area and
strike down over the edge of the wall this way.

2616
03:23:59,506 --> 03:24:01,746
ASHLEY: I would like to Insect Plague.

2617
03:24:01,746 --> 03:24:10,340
MARISHA: Yes, I've always wanted to do this spell,
yes, do it! It's not our style, so we can't do it

2618
03:24:10,340 --> 03:24:11,933
in the real game.

2619
03:24:11,933 --> 03:24:19,885
MATT: (singing) Insect Plague. (normal voice) It
is concentration, so this would--

2620
03:24:19,885 --> 03:24:21,601
ASHLEY: Get rid of Spirit Guardians?

2621
03:24:21,601 --> 03:24:25,457
MATT: Up to you. It is a 20-foot radius. Where do
you want to put it?

2622
03:24:25,457 --> 03:24:27,510
ASHLEY: I want to put it around that area.

2623
03:24:27,510 --> 03:24:32,949
MATT: Which one? Around this area? Okay, so,
keeping you outside the radius. Where do you want

2624
03:24:32,949 --> 03:24:38,724
it to go? This whole area there, the center where
it went off? Okay. But keeping you out of the

2625
03:24:38,724 --> 03:24:45,322
radius, I imagine? So maybe putting you about
there would get this whole area there.

2626
03:24:45,322 --> 03:24:48,513
ASHLEY: If he's not in there, this is going to
<i>blow</i>!

2627
03:24:48,513 --> 03:24:53,838
MATT: You drop down Insect Plague, your spirit
guardian vanishes as, instead, suddenly, swirling

2628
03:24:53,838 --> 03:24:58,340
from the cracks in the ground, a cloud of biting
scarabs, locusts, and various poisonous insects

2629
03:24:58,340 --> 03:25:05,749
begin to fill the area. The loud buzzing sound
fills the entire area. Vax, I need you to make a

2630
03:25:05,749 --> 03:25:08,041
constitution saving throw.

2631
03:25:08,041 --> 03:25:09,880
TALIESIN: Whoa!

2632
03:25:09,880 --> 03:25:14,113
LIAM: You nudged her towards that corner, Mercer,
you nudged her towards that corner

2633
03:25:14,113 --> 03:25:17,421
MATT: No, she said where it happened. But away
from herself. It would have been--

2634
03:25:17,421 --> 03:25:18,887
MARISHA: Is that a natural one?

2635
03:25:18,887 --> 03:25:22,913
MATT: Natural one. 4d10 piercing damage.

2636
03:25:22,913 --> 03:25:28,103
MARISHA: Doesn't he also have some sort of poison
from Insect Plague, or something like that?

2637
03:25:28,103 --> 03:25:30,591
MATT: No, it's just piercing damage. Things biting
and clawing at him.

2638
03:25:30,591 --> 03:25:33,462
LIAM: And there's no Uncanny Dodge because it's an
area.

2639
03:25:33,462 --> 03:25:36,120
MATT: Correct, yeah. Only against directed spell
attacks.

2640
03:25:36,120 --> 03:25:37,616
LIAM: Four tens?

2641
03:25:37,616 --> 03:25:45,091
ASHLEY: How many did I roll?

2642
03:25:45,091 --> 03:25:47,052
MATT: Four. What you did do?

2643
03:25:47,052 --> 03:25:48,691
ASHLEY: 13.

2644
03:25:48,691 --> 03:25:50,291
MATT: 13 points of piercing damage.

2645
03:25:50,291 --> 03:25:58,069
MARISHA: Rough. That's a pretty shitty roll,
though.

2646
03:25:58,069 --> 03:26:05,904
MATT: You see, all of a sudden, all the insects
coalesce and start biting in an area. You see the

2647
03:26:05,904 --> 03:26:12,418
shape of Vax appearing in this corner there,
briefly, as the insects are biting. You want to

2648
03:26:12,418 --> 03:26:14,673
move, still?

2649
03:26:14,673 --> 03:26:31,963
ASHLEY: Yes. I'd like to move-- Can I move in
between? Between the walls?

2650
03:26:31,963 --> 03:26:33,374
MATT: You can move over there if you want to.

2651
03:26:33,423 --> 03:26:37,358
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll move in there. Not that that's
that far away from him, but maybe he didn't see

2652
03:26:37,358 --> 03:26:38,957
because bugs are biting him.

2653
03:26:38,957 --> 03:26:45,552
MATT: So through the pains and anger and the
cloud, you can just-- The area is lightly obscured.

2654
03:26:45,552 --> 03:26:51,215
ASHLEY: Do I have a bonus action? I'm going to--
Can I cast Shield of Faith on myself again?

2655
03:26:51,215 --> 03:26:53,388
MATT: You can, but you'll lose your Insect
Plague.

2656
03:26:53,388 --> 03:26:58,332
ASHLEY: Never mind. Is that continuous?

2657
03:26:58,332 --> 03:27:08,549
MATT: It's concentration, yeah. The insects stay
until you leave the area. So let's see here.

2658
03:27:08,549 --> 03:27:14,888
That's part of that. There. Ending Pike's turn,
that brings us to Vax.

2659
03:27:14,888 --> 03:27:21,531
LIAM: Will you allow me to go to here and then
Jason Bourne behind these, like a boss, and go

2660
03:27:21,531 --> 03:27:22,975
stealth right there?

2661
03:27:22,975 --> 03:27:25,291
MATT: There is no way to see through these walls
right now, technically.

2662
03:27:25,291 --> 03:27:26,592
LIAM: Oh, I thought there was a gap.

2663
03:27:26,592 --> 03:27:28,069
MATT: It's in the design.

2664
03:27:28,069 --> 03:27:30,250
LIAM: I'm right here. I'm gonna go stealth.

2665
03:27:30,250 --> 03:27:33,789
MATT: However, you do also need to make a
dexterity saving throw as you rush into the radius.

2666
03:27:33,789 --> 03:27:38,056
MARISHA: Would that affect Pike, too? On her move.
Sleet Storm.

2667
03:27:38,056 --> 03:27:41,104
MATT: Technically, yeah. Thank you for reminding
me.

2668
03:27:41,104 --> 03:27:43,310
LIAM: This is the Sleet Storm that I'm dexing?

2669
03:27:43,310 --> 03:27:46,136
MATT: This will be the Sleet Storm. You make one
as well.

2670
03:27:46,136 --> 03:27:48,987
ASHLEY: A dex saving throw?

2671
03:27:48,987 --> 03:27:50,686
LIAM: 20.

2672
03:27:50,686 --> 03:27:54,678
ASHLEY: Wow. Three.

2673
03:27:54,678 --> 03:27:59,774
MATT: Three? You would have not been able to get
over there. You would have gotten to there with

2674
03:27:59,774 --> 03:28:03,549
your full movement. You had to use half of it to
get up.

2675
03:28:03,549 --> 03:28:07,713
LIAM: Stealth is 27.

2676
03:28:07,713 --> 03:28:09,626
ASHLEY: This is so stressful.

2677
03:28:09,626 --> 03:28:12,100
MATT: She technically only got that far. So you know.

2678
03:28:12,100 --> 03:28:16,673
LIAM: Is that where she was standing at the
beginning of my turn? Then I want to do it here instead.

2679
03:28:16,673 --> 03:28:21,414
MATT: Okay. Now make another dexterity check. No,
a dexterity saving throw, sorry. As you rush into

2680
03:28:21,414 --> 03:28:23,860
the radius of her Guardian--

2681
03:28:23,860 --> 03:28:25,966
LIAM: Didn't she dispel it for the bugs?

2682
03:28:25,966 --> 03:28:28,106
MATT: No, she has two up, one of them isn't
concentration.

2683
03:28:28,106 --> 03:28:30,214
MARISHA: Oh, the Guardian is not concentration?

2684
03:28:30,214 --> 03:28:32,621
MATT: It lasts for eight hours.

2685
03:28:32,621 --> 03:28:35,694
MARISHA: That's dope. Holy fuck, that's dope.

2686
03:28:35,694 --> 03:28:36,731
LIAM: 24.

2687
03:28:36,731 --> 03:28:39,005
ASHLEY: Yeah, you're fine.

2688
03:28:39,005 --> 03:28:46,921
LIAM: Stealth. And I will-- I haven't taken
an action yet. Because that was a bonus.

2689
03:28:46,921 --> 03:28:50,182
MARISHA: You've rolled so much, and you haven't
done anything.

2690
03:28:50,182 --> 03:28:56,135
ASHLEY: Is he going stealth? God dangit.

2691
03:28:56,135 --> 03:28:57,849
MATT: It's what he does.

2692
03:28:57,849 --> 03:29:04,329
TALIESIN: It's like trying to hit him with a
spotlight, and then throw everything you can at him.

2693
03:29:04,329 --> 03:29:09,019
MARISHA: It totally is. I should have fucking
packed Faerie Fire, that was stupid.

2694
03:29:09,019 --> 03:29:10,460
ASHLEY: What is Faerie Fire?

2695
03:29:10,460 --> 03:29:15,348
MARISHA: It lights up everything. I took Cure
Wounds and Thunderwave and Healing Word instead

2696
03:29:15,348 --> 03:29:21,940
for my 1st-level spells. It's a really good
1st-level spell.

2697
03:29:21,940 --> 03:29:26,055
TALIESIN: It is. It's an anti-rogue spell.

2698
03:29:26,055 --> 03:29:33,031
MATT: Got it. Okay. That ends Vax's turn. Keyleth,
you're up. You watch as this cloud of insects

2699
03:29:33,031 --> 03:29:38,531
appears in this corner. You see a coughing Vax run
this way to the edge and then disappear behind that wall.

2700
03:29:38,531 --> 03:29:42,155
MARISHA: He disappears over here through this
wall?

2701
03:29:42,155 --> 03:29:45,073
MATT: He disappears through this little channel
here, and he doesn't appear to leave it. There's

2702
03:29:45,073 --> 03:29:47,724
still insects filling this whole space here.

2703
03:29:47,724 --> 03:29:49,379
LIAM: Disappeared into the bugs, man.

2704
03:29:49,379 --> 03:30:02,503
MARISHA: Into bugs, into bugs, into bugs, bugs,
bugs. Totally with you there.

2705
03:30:02,503 --> 03:30:04,564
MATT: This is getting real interesting.

2706
03:30:04,677 --> 03:30:11,296
MARISHA: Okay, hang on a second. Hang on, hang on.
Sorry, I'm double-checking something before I do

2707
03:30:11,296 --> 03:30:12,743
something stupid.

2708
03:30:12,743 --> 03:30:16,172
MATT: Yeah, not too bad.

2709
03:30:16,172 --> 03:30:30,026
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to pop around the corner,
and I'm going to do Fire Storm all up where I

2710
03:30:30,026 --> 03:30:37,781
think there's bitches. So since I saw Vax go this
way and a bunch of action and a bunch of insects

2711
03:30:37,781 --> 03:30:39,637
over here, I'm going to start it here.

2712
03:30:39,637 --> 03:30:45,567
MATT: Okay, so we'll say cube, cube, cube.

2713
03:30:45,567 --> 03:30:50,013
MARISHA: I'll probably try and get this corner,
too. Cube.

2714
03:30:50,013 --> 03:31:01,983
MATT and MARISHA: (counting)

2715
03:31:02,042 --> 03:31:03,831
MATT: Covering this vicinity here?

2716
03:31:04,104 --> 03:31:08,683
MARISHA: Yeah. (counting)

2717
03:31:08,683 --> 03:31:19,901
MATT: Okay. So suddenly the ground, already hot,
bursts forth in flames surrounding the whole area.

2718
03:31:19,901 --> 03:31:22,176
What's the saving throw on that?

2719
03:31:22,176 --> 03:31:23,273
MARISHA: Dex.

2720
03:31:23,273 --> 03:31:25,153
MATT: Pike, I need you to roll a dex saving
throw.

2721
03:31:25,153 --> 03:31:27,724
MARISHA: Just Pike?

2722
03:31:27,724 --> 03:31:28,879
MATT: Yeah, just Pike.

2723
03:31:28,879 --> 03:31:32,863
ASHLEY: Six.

2724
03:31:32,863 --> 03:31:36,626
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll damage.

2725
03:31:36,626 --> 03:31:38,885
MARISHA: That's 7d10.

2726
03:31:38,885 --> 03:31:45,237
(laughter)

2727
03:31:45,237 --> 03:31:48,067
MARISHA: (yells) Anger!

2728
03:31:48,067 --> 03:31:52,703
LIAM: In another life, somewhere, I'm very much in
love with you, but not this day.

2729
03:31:52,703 --> 03:31:55,807
ASHLEY: 7d10.

2730
03:31:55,807 --> 03:32:06,596
MATT: I know someone in the chat's paying
attention, and I lost track of that. How many

2731
03:32:06,596 --> 03:32:09,568
rounds have we gone so far?

2732
03:32:09,568 --> 03:32:26,514
MARISHA: Ooh. 24. 34. 43 plus another five. 48
points of fire damage.

2733
03:32:26,514 --> 03:32:30,053
ASHLEY: Shit. Okay.

2734
03:32:30,053 --> 03:32:33,996
MATT: I should not have asked chat. (laughs)

2735
03:32:33,996 --> 03:32:40,544
LIAM: What spells are going on right now? Ice
Storm's still happening?

2736
03:32:40,544 --> 03:32:44,041
MARISHA: Apparently 13. Critrolestats is the only
one we trust.

2737
03:32:44,041 --> 03:32:50,187
MATT: Okay, so just so you're aware, the surge of
energy that you felt from your boots has faded.

2738
03:32:50,187 --> 03:32:53,784
You no longer have the haste enchantment.

2739
03:32:53,784 --> 03:32:56,748
ASHLEY: Phew. Okay.

2740
03:32:56,748 --> 03:33:00,301
LIAM: Has it already been ten rounds already?

2741
03:33:00,301 --> 03:33:03,378
MATT: Yeah, it's been 13. You've technically had
it for more rounds than you should've, but it's fine.

2742
03:33:03,378 --> 03:33:09,921
TALIESIN: The Beyonder is a mysterious creature.
The laws of physics do not apply here.

2743
03:33:09,921 --> 03:33:16,741
MATT: All right, so is that your turn? What else
are you doing?

2744
03:33:16,741 --> 03:33:18,294
MARISHA: Hiding again.

2745
03:33:18,294 --> 03:33:20,326
MATT: Okay, so you move back into this little area
there.

2746
03:33:20,326 --> 03:33:21,957
MARISHA: And I'm still maintaining my Ice Storm.

2747
03:33:21,957 --> 03:33:24,129
MATT: Are you moving further back this way or
staying in that same pocket there?

2748
03:33:24,129 --> 03:33:27,330
MARISHA: Just sucking up in that pocket against
the wall.

2749
03:33:27,330 --> 03:33:33,919
MATT: Okay, we'll say there. All right, cool. That
ends Keyleth's turn. Pike, you're up. The flames

2750
03:33:33,919 --> 03:33:39,228
that erupt around you subside. You're finding
yourself singed and burned and angry. I need you

2751
03:33:39,228 --> 03:33:46,041
to go ahead and roll a constitution check to see
if you maintain-- how much damage did you take

2752
03:33:46,041 --> 03:33:47,130
total from that?

2753
03:33:47,130 --> 03:33:48,741
MARISHA: 48.

2754
03:33:48,741 --> 03:33:54,199
MATT: 48 damage. Roll a constitution check. You
have to beat a 24.

2755
03:33:54,199 --> 03:34:01,200
ASHLEY: I have to beat a 24? There's no way. Yeah,
there's no way.

2756
03:34:01,200 --> 03:34:03,640
MATT: Insect Plague fades away. The insects
subside and vanish.

2757
03:34:03,640 --> 03:34:07,685
ASHLEY: Okay. Okay! Okay.

2758
03:34:07,685 --> 03:34:09,684
MARISHA: We're so frustrating against ourselves.

2759
03:34:09,684 --> 03:34:13,132
TALIESIN: This is phenomenal to watch.

2760
03:34:13,132 --> 03:34:17,236
ASHLEY: I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on myself.

2761
03:34:17,236 --> 03:34:21,902
MATT: Go for it. What level are you doing it?

2762
03:34:21,902 --> 03:34:23,308
ASHLEY: Four.

2763
03:34:23,308 --> 03:34:26,823
MATT: Level four? Okay. I'm pretty sure this is
all your 4th-level spells, right?

2764
03:34:26,823 --> 03:34:28,207
ASHLEY: I have one more.

2765
03:34:28,207 --> 03:34:29,626
MATT: You have one more?

2766
03:34:29,626 --> 03:34:33,152
ASHLEY: Well, I have two. After this one, I'll
have one more.

2767
03:34:33,152 --> 03:34:38,572
MATT: You have two, but I'm pretty sure Spirit
Guardians-- you put that at a higher level, that's

2768
03:34:38,572 --> 03:34:41,211
right. What was it, guardian--

2769
03:34:41,211 --> 03:34:45,952
ASHLEY: Okay.

2770
03:34:45,952 --> 03:34:53,711
MATT: No, that's true. Your Guardian of Faith was
4th-level. You couldn't do that at a higher

2771
03:34:53,711 --> 03:34:57,774
level. So this would be your last 4th-level
spell.

2772
03:34:57,774 --> 03:35:00,160
ASHLEY: Because I have four because of the ring.

2773
03:35:00,160 --> 03:35:01,059
MATT: Oh!

2774
03:35:01,059 --> 03:35:02,513
ASHLEY: Keyleth's ring, yeah.

2775
03:35:02,513 --> 03:35:03,883
LIAM: Why'd you give her that ring?

2776
03:35:03,883 --> 03:35:11,398
MARISHA: Seemed like a good idea at the time.
Never give her the ring.

2777
03:35:11,398 --> 03:35:13,127
LIAM: Was this some sort of Hunger Games deal?

2778
03:35:13,127 --> 03:35:24,163
MATT: So the ring gives you an additional four
levels in spells. Okay.

2779
03:35:24,163 --> 03:35:28,174
MARISHA: Are you talking about my spell slot ring
of holding, my level five spell slot ring holding?

2780
03:35:28,174 --> 03:35:32,929
ASHLEY: Yeah. Yes.

2781
03:35:32,929 --> 03:35:34,371
MATT: Okay.

2782
03:35:34,371 --> 03:35:39,660
MARISHA: Well, it would mean you would have a
4th-level and you could have a level one.

2783
03:35:39,660 --> 03:35:46,296
MATT: They have to have already been prepared, is
how it would work. We'll say you had your Guardian

2784
03:35:46,296 --> 03:35:49,821
Spirit as what you had in there, as part of your
plan anyway, so that's fine.

2785
03:35:49,821 --> 03:35:58,340
MARISHA: I took your cloak, so I technically have
your cloak from-- if we're going from the last game.

2786
03:35:58,340 --> 03:36:05,611
MATT: We're using the basic gear you would have
normally. So technically you would have that ring?

2787
03:36:05,611 --> 03:36:08,220
MARISHA: It's normally my ring.

2788
03:36:08,220 --> 03:36:11,365
ASHLEY: I don't think that's what it is.

2789
03:36:11,365 --> 03:36:18,858
MARISHA: There were two rings. We got a 5th-level
that kept, and then there was a lower level--

2790
03:36:18,858 --> 03:36:20,267
MATT: There was a 3rd-level one.

2791
03:36:20,267 --> 03:36:23,180
MARISHA: There was a 3rd-level that I might have
given you.

2792
03:36:23,180 --> 03:36:30,607
MATT: Anyway. For the time being, as we're on.

2793
03:36:30,607 --> 03:36:39,737
TALIESIN: I'm reading chat, and everyone's like,
wow, Taliesin's spaced out. No, I'm just reading

2794
03:36:39,737 --> 03:36:42,743
chat! I'm just watching it.

2795
03:36:42,743 --> 03:36:46,792
MARISHA: No, it's just we actually get to see
chat.

2796
03:36:46,792 --> 03:36:50,127
TALIESIN: Normally don't get to see chat.

2797
03:36:50,127 --> 03:36:56,105
ASHLEY: Now I'll move. Does that last for a long
time, or is that a one-time deal, the flame storm?

2798
03:36:56,105 --> 03:36:57,424
MATT: It's a one-time thing.

2799
03:36:57,424 --> 03:37:02,488
ASHLEY: Okay. So I'm going to tuck back behind
that wall.

2800
03:37:02,488 --> 03:37:06,987
MATT: Over here? Back around this way or this
way?

2801
03:37:06,987 --> 03:37:13,875
ASHLEY: Just back towards my Guardian of Faith.
Not visible, though. In between.

2802
03:37:13,875 --> 03:37:22,075
MATT: Okay. This section. Okay, all right. That
ends Pike's turn. Vax, you're up.

2803
03:37:22,075 --> 03:37:27,954
MARISHA: Where the fuck are you? Because you're
not in my fucking Fire Storm.

2804
03:37:27,954 --> 03:37:31,356
LIAM: Hi. Right at Pike.

2805
03:37:31,356 --> 03:37:38,120
MARISHA: He wasn't in my-- son of a dick.

2806
03:37:38,120 --> 03:37:41,745
LIAM: Oh, that's a natural one. Okay, so--

2807
03:37:41,745 --> 03:37:45,105
MATT: Pike, as you run up, all of a sudden you
hear a ting! And a blade streaks off the back of

2808
03:37:45,105 --> 03:37:47,681
your armor. You turn the corner and you see Vax
looking there sheepishly.

2809
03:37:47,681 --> 03:37:53,245
ASHLEY: Ooh. And so now I see him.

2810
03:37:53,245 --> 03:37:56,672
MATT: You do. You're no longer hasted.

2811
03:37:56,672 --> 03:37:58,349
LIAM: I know, I know.

2812
03:37:58,349 --> 03:38:01,459
MARISHA: I'm not your friend, buddy.

2813
03:38:01,459 --> 03:38:02,917
TALIESIN: I'm not your buddy, friend.

2814
03:38:02,917 --> 03:38:04,350
MARISHA: I'm not your friend, pal.

2815
03:38:04,350 --> 03:38:08,355
LIAM: Is this out of sight here? Is this a solid
wall?

2816
03:38:08,355 --> 03:38:09,617
MATT: Yeah, that would be a solid wall.

2817
03:38:09,617 --> 03:38:19,789
LIAM: Okay. I'm going to roll stealth there.
That's a 25, so.

2818
03:38:19,789 --> 03:38:24,508
MATT: Go ahead and roll a perception check, just
to keep that in mind.

2819
03:38:24,508 --> 03:38:31,161
ASHLEY: Is he invisible? No? 19.

2820
03:38:31,161 --> 03:38:34,535
MATT: No. You just see him duck on the other side
of the wall and vanish.

2821
03:38:34,535 --> 03:38:36,689
ASHLEY: Damn it.

2822
03:38:36,689 --> 03:38:39,454
LIAM: I want to go--

2823
03:38:39,454 --> 03:38:43,214
MATT: Rogues, man.

2824
03:38:43,214 --> 03:38:47,823
TALIESIN: They're still doing South Park.

2825
03:38:47,823 --> 03:38:50,692
MARISHA: Well, it takes a while for them to catch
up.

2826
03:38:50,692 --> 03:38:54,020
ASHLEY: How are we health-wise, everybody?

2827
03:38:54,020 --> 03:38:59,990
TALIESIN: Keyleth is fine. She may even be
pristine.

2828
03:38:59,990 --> 03:39:05,703
MARISHA: I'm not pristine. I've taken sneak-attack
damage. Which hurt badly.

2829
03:39:05,703 --> 03:39:13,187
MATT: Okay, that ends Vax's turn. Keyleth, you're
up.

2830
03:39:13,187 --> 03:39:21,611
MARISHA: Keyleth is up. Okay. Keyleth is going to
peek around the corner. I can see Pike, right?

2831
03:39:21,611 --> 03:39:23,133
MATT: Nope. You can't see anybody.

2832
03:39:23,133 --> 03:39:24,495
MARISHA: I can't see Pike through this?

2833
03:39:24,495 --> 03:39:26,816
MATT: No, these walls are full walls. These aren't
little.

2834
03:39:26,816 --> 03:39:40,322
MARISHA: Oh. Solid wall. I can't see anybody.

2835
03:39:40,322 --> 03:39:42,908
MATT: Nope. Your guess is as good as anybody's.

2836
03:39:42,908 --> 03:39:50,998
MARISHA: Great. Great. I thought I was going to be
able to see her.

2837
03:39:50,998 --> 03:39:54,385
MATT: Sleet Storm was dropped, guys. It's all
good.

2838
03:39:54,385 --> 03:39:56,084
MARISHA: Was Sleet Storm dropped?

2839
03:39:56,084 --> 03:40:04,031
MATT: Yeah, you took a bunch of damage. No, you
didn't. It's still going. I'm so confused by all

2840
03:40:04,031 --> 03:40:05,018
your spells.

2841
03:40:05,018 --> 03:40:10,070
MARISHA: So he still has to make dex checks,
right? So does she. And so concentrations, I

2842
03:40:10,070 --> 03:40:12,490
should remember it, and I did.

2843
03:40:12,490 --> 03:40:14,487
MATT: I'm trying to keep all this in my head,
ugh.

2844
03:40:14,487 --> 03:40:15,742
LIAM: Dex save, 24.

2845
03:40:15,742 --> 03:40:17,126
MATT: Okay. Pike, make a dex save.

2846
03:40:17,126 --> 03:40:24,503
ASHLEY: Okay. I did move. 16.

2847
03:40:24,503 --> 03:40:28,246
MATT: Yeah, even though you probably didn't move
that far, so you would have just moved back half

2848
03:40:28,246 --> 03:40:31,861
your movement, so you're fine. It's fine. Didn't
make a huge difference.

2849
03:40:31,861 --> 03:40:35,181
MARISHA: Okay.

2850
03:40:35,181 --> 03:40:40,781
MATT: It's true, you do confuse me. Love you guys,
but you do confuse me.

2851
03:40:40,781 --> 03:40:47,975
MARISHA: I can't see anybody through my window,
then. Right?

2852
03:40:47,975 --> 03:40:50,698
MATT: No. You have locked yourself into a bunker
with a very limited viewpoint.

2853
03:40:50,698 --> 03:40:53,097
TALIESIN: Metaphor.

2854
03:40:53,097 --> 03:40:58,524
MARISHA: I died really quickly last time. I didn't
want to--

2855
03:40:58,524 --> 03:41:02,396
MATT: So you can either wait it out or start
making a guessing game.

2856
03:41:02,396 --> 03:41:07,235
MARISHA: But that's the thing, it's the guessing
game. I don't have a lot of AOEs at this point.

2857
03:41:07,235 --> 03:41:19,168
Actually, you know what? I brought Tidal Wave.
Where was the last action that I saw? I saw shit

2858
03:41:19,168 --> 03:41:20,368
go down over here?

2859
03:41:20,368 --> 03:41:22,236
MATT: You didn't see anything. You ducked behind
that wall.

2860
03:41:22,236 --> 03:41:26,360
MARISHA: Okay, so the last thing that I
realistically saw was insects and--

2861
03:41:26,360 --> 03:41:33,684
MATT: Still insects over here, dashes of light
over here, yeah. And you saw Pike over here get flamed.

2862
03:41:33,684 --> 03:41:40,000
MARISHA: Okay, let me peek around the corner. Can
I do a quick perception check to see if I can spot

2863
03:41:40,000 --> 03:41:41,835
any movement or--

2864
03:41:41,835 --> 03:41:43,435
MATT: Sure, make a perception check.

2865
03:41:43,435 --> 03:41:53,107
(laughter)

2866
03:41:53,107 --> 03:41:57,353
MATT: It's hard to see through the sleet right
now, man. All that sleet is helping you, but it's

2867
03:41:57,353 --> 03:41:59,371
also-- you can't see shit.

2868
03:41:59,371 --> 03:42:04,141
LIAM: Is that an action, like an effort for Pike
would waste an action?

2869
03:42:04,141 --> 03:42:05,858
MATT: Yeah.

2870
03:42:05,858 --> 03:42:11,109
MARISHA: If I can't see anybody, I can't do
anything. I don't have line of sight, and I

2871
03:42:11,109 --> 03:42:15,432
literally burned my AOE spell that I brought for
the day.

2872
03:42:15,432 --> 03:42:16,598
LIAM: Yeah, you're in a pickle.

2873
03:42:16,598 --> 03:42:20,208
(laughter)

2874
03:42:20,208 --> 03:42:21,690
MATT: You're such an asshole.

2875
03:42:21,690 --> 03:42:32,085
MARISHA: Such a dick. I'm going to cast Cure
Wounds, a level two Cure Wounds on myself, because

2876
03:42:32,085 --> 03:42:33,864
I can't see shit.

2877
03:42:33,864 --> 03:42:41,451
MATT: Remember, you can also hold your action in
case something--

2878
03:42:41,451 --> 03:42:44,295
MARISHA: That's true.

2879
03:42:44,295 --> 03:42:50,005
MATT: You can have a spell ready and have it
trigger for a spell that can happen once it occurs.

2880
03:42:50,005 --> 03:42:58,419
MARISHA: That's true. I never do that because I'm
a melee person. Well, let me just cure myself

2881
03:42:58,419 --> 03:43:03,316
since I already said I was going to do it. So I'm
going to roll a 2nd-level Cure Wounds, which is--

2882
03:43:03,316 --> 03:43:10,877
and then I'm going to tuck back behind my wall,
because that's where I'm happy, in my box. Level two.

2883
03:43:10,877 --> 03:43:24,156
MATT: So that's 2d8 plus six for you. 13. You heal
13 hit points. Pike, you're up.

2884
03:43:24,156 --> 03:43:27,825
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on
myself again at 2nd-level.

2885
03:43:27,825 --> 03:43:34,886
MATT: So 2d8 plus five.

2886
03:43:34,886 --> 03:43:44,987
ASHLEY: Okay, so 15. And then Shield of Faith as a
bonus action, and I'm going to stay for now.

2887
03:43:44,987 --> 03:43:51,576
MATT: All right, Shield of Faith is up again,
protecting you, standing where you are, not moving

2888
03:43:51,576 --> 03:43:55,899
anywhere. All right, cool. Vax, you're up.

2889
03:43:55,899 --> 03:43:57,561
LIAM: Yeah.

2890
03:43:57,561 --> 03:44:04,515
MATT: Oh, at the top of your turn, by the way,
because sleet's still moving, dexterity saving throw.

2891
03:44:04,515 --> 03:44:06,245
ASHLEY: I didn't move.

2892
03:44:06,245 --> 03:44:08,387
MATT: You didn't move, so it wouldn't have made a
huge difference anyway, so that's fine.

2893
03:44:08,387 --> 03:44:10,124
MARISHA: But concentration spell?

2894
03:44:10,124 --> 03:44:14,186
MATT: She cast it at the end of her turn. She
already lost concentration because of your last

2895
03:44:14,186 --> 03:44:16,525
flaming column of fire of doom.

2896
03:44:16,525 --> 03:44:17,831
MARISHA: Burn burn burn.

2897
03:44:17,831 --> 03:44:19,966
MATT: So dexterity saving throw?

2898
03:44:19,966 --> 03:44:21,843
LIAM: Is a 23.

2899
03:44:21,843 --> 03:44:23,150
MATT: Yeah, you're fine.

2900
03:44:23,150 --> 03:44:25,628
LIAM: Okay.

2901
03:44:25,628 --> 03:44:27,730
ASHLEY: Where the fuck are you?

2902
03:44:27,730 --> 03:44:31,424
TALIESIN: It's like Where's Waldo with knives.

2903
03:44:31,424 --> 03:44:34,579
MARISHA: It totally is. If Waldo was a serial
killer.

2904
03:44:34,579 --> 03:44:37,150
TALIESIN: (creepy voice) Where am I?

2905
03:44:37,150 --> 03:44:40,237
ASHLEY: I mean, we can't--

2906
03:44:40,237 --> 03:44:46,781
TALIESIN: I would think a dark reboot of Where's
Waldo would do really well.

2907
03:44:46,781 --> 03:44:49,962
MARISHA: That would be phenomenal. Like a Freddy
Krueger Where's Waldo.

2908
03:44:49,962 --> 03:44:56,427
ASHLEY: If you find him, you die. This is rough.

2909
03:44:56,427 --> 03:45:00,376
MATT: All right, that ends Vax's turn. Keyleth,
you're up.

2910
03:45:00,376 --> 03:45:01,899
ASHLEY: He's right behind me, isn't he?

2911
03:45:01,899 --> 03:45:07,368
MARISHA: Again? Already? Okay, I'm going to peek
around my corner. Do I see anybody? Another

2912
03:45:07,368 --> 03:45:12,602
perception check. I'm going to peek through my
wall of my hole that I've made.

2913
03:45:12,602 --> 03:45:16,313
MATT: This is your action to take your perception,
by the way.

2914
03:45:16,313 --> 03:45:18,003
MARISHA: It's an action?

2915
03:45:18,003 --> 03:45:23,925
MATT: Bonus action, we'll say. 27? What did you
roll?

2916
03:45:23,925 --> 03:45:26,653
MARISHA: 27 to see where the fuck you are.

2917
03:45:26,653 --> 03:45:32,260
LIAM: Perception? I rolled-- well, here's the
thing. Let me tell you.

2918
03:45:32,260 --> 03:45:46,180
TALIESIN: I imagine a little chessboard--

2919
03:45:46,180 --> 03:45:48,946
MATT: Are you looking through this way?

2920
03:45:48,946 --> 03:45:51,011
MARISHA: I'm looking through this wall.

2921
03:45:51,011 --> 03:45:53,207
MATT: You don't see anything.

2922
03:45:53,207 --> 03:45:58,055
MARISHA: Then I prepare a Blight spell, and I
hold.

2923
03:45:58,055 --> 03:45:59,161
MATT: Until?

2924
03:45:59,161 --> 03:46:04,147
MARISHA: Until I see either Pike or Vax appear in
my view.

2925
03:46:04,147 --> 03:46:09,028
MATT: Okay. Good to know. All right, that brings
us to Pike's turn. Pike, what are you doing?

2926
03:46:09,028 --> 03:46:24,335
ASHLEY: I'm going to hold my turn until someone
attacks me.

2927
03:46:24,335 --> 03:46:27,870
MARISHA: Nobody move!

2928
03:46:27,870 --> 03:46:32,728
MATT: You can't hold your whole turn. You have an
action prepared. What do you want to do with your action?

2929
03:46:32,728 --> 03:46:36,046
ASHLEY: If someone attacks me, then I'm going to
attack back.

2930
03:46:36,046 --> 03:46:39,897
MATT: Okay, so you're going to hold your attack
action until somebody attacks you? Okay.

2931
03:46:39,897 --> 03:46:42,122
ASHLEY: Come out of hiding, motherfucker!

2932
03:46:42,122 --> 03:46:45,169
MARISHA: Come out, come out, wherever you are.

2933
03:46:45,169 --> 03:46:49,157
MATT: That brings us to Vax's turn.

2934
03:46:49,157 --> 03:46:54,337
ASHLEY: (whistles as if for a dog)

2935
03:46:54,337 --> 03:46:58,078
MATT: Okay. It is now Keyleth's turn.

2936
03:46:58,078 --> 03:47:02,915
MARISHA: Are you just fucking hiding,
motherfucker? Are you just waiting this out? Are

2937
03:47:02,915 --> 03:47:05,545
you camping right now? Are you being a fucking
camper?

2938
03:47:05,545 --> 03:47:07,060
LIAM: This is in-tents.

2939
03:47:07,060 --> 03:47:11,056
TALIESIN: Wow.

2940
03:47:11,056 --> 03:47:18,410
MATT: I'm going to give you damage for that.
(laughs) I'm kidding. This is turning into a bad

2941
03:47:18,410 --> 03:47:20,463
Counterstrike match real fast.

2942
03:47:20,463 --> 03:47:24,596
MARISHA: I'm going to do another scan to see if I
can find the motherfucker.

2943
03:47:24,596 --> 03:47:25,999
MATT: Looking out where?

2944
03:47:25,999 --> 03:47:30,168
MARISHA: My same hole! And then probably nothing.
18.

2945
03:47:30,168 --> 03:47:31,498
MATT: Nothing.

2946
03:47:31,498 --> 03:47:41,978
MARISHA: Okay, someone's got to do something here.
Let me see. What do I have in my bag? Papa's got a

2947
03:47:41,978 --> 03:47:54,879
brand new bag. I am going to--

2948
03:47:54,879 --> 03:47:57,926
MATT: You're on deck, Pike.

2949
03:47:57,926 --> 03:48:05,357
MARISHA: I still have a Blight spell prepared,
right?

2950
03:48:05,357 --> 03:48:06,993
MATT: You didn't cast it. It never happened.

2951
03:48:06,993 --> 03:48:08,951
MARISHA: So I put it away?

2952
03:48:08,951 --> 03:48:11,878
MATT: Yeah. You didn't actually cast it. You were
ready that if it happened, you would do it

2953
03:48:11,878 --> 03:48:17,339
immediately. You could do the same thing, if you
wanted to, though it seems like everyone is doing

2954
03:48:17,339 --> 03:48:21,790
nothing right now, so if this continues, I'm going
to have to shake things up.

2955
03:48:21,790 --> 03:48:30,351
MARISHA: I'm going to crawl out of the wall here.
Crawl over. This is still lava flow, correct?

2956
03:48:30,351 --> 03:48:33,984
MATT: It is, but the sleet spell has cooled it,
and most of this now is darkened rock again,

2957
03:48:33,984 --> 03:48:40,373
actually, due to the constant cold rain and snow.
It's still hot in there, but there's a shell of

2958
03:48:40,373 --> 03:48:44,156
rock over it. You're not sure how strong it is.

2959
03:48:44,156 --> 03:48:50,586
MARISHA: All right, here's what I want to do,
then--

2960
03:48:50,586 --> 03:48:59,428
MATT: Also, how does the sleet spell work? You may
have walked into your own spell radius.

2961
03:48:59,428 --> 03:49:07,219
TALIESIN: That would be-- never mind.

2962
03:49:07,219 --> 03:49:13,139
MATT: When a creature enters the spell area. Yeah.
If you don't want to do that, you can back up, but

2963
03:49:13,139 --> 03:49:14,952
otherwise, you'd be walking right into your sleet
spell.

2964
03:49:14,952 --> 03:49:18,019
MARISHA: I didn't realize it would stretch that
far.

2965
03:49:18,019 --> 03:49:20,739
MATT: Yeah, it's a 40-foot radius, so it's out to
here.

2966
03:49:20,739 --> 03:49:28,590
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to-- sorry, there's a lot
going on.

2967
03:49:28,590 --> 03:49:43,215
MATT: What are you doing?

2968
03:49:43,215 --> 03:49:48,691
MARISHA: I'm trying to figure it out! I don't have
a whole lot! I'm going to cast a Tidal Wave. I'm

2969
03:49:48,691 --> 03:50:04,015
going to leave my sleet spell up, I guess. I will
cast a Tidal Wave, which is in this thing, ten

2970
03:50:04,015 --> 03:50:05,618
feet wide, ten feet tall.

2971
03:50:05,618 --> 03:50:06,984
MATT: Yup.

2972
03:50:06,984 --> 03:50:13,095
MARISHA: 30-foot long.

2973
03:50:13,095 --> 03:50:19,673
MATT: Yup. So you have a ten-foot-wide column you
can put anywhere for 30 feet.

2974
03:50:19,673 --> 03:50:26,883
MARISHA: Anywhere in a 20-foot radius, so I can
see here, correct? I want to do it going this way.

2975
03:50:26,883 --> 03:50:30,029
MATT: Starting from where?

2976
03:50:30,029 --> 03:50:33,668
MARISHA: Here, where I can see, and going this
way.

2977
03:50:33,668 --> 03:50:39,945
MATT: Okay. Five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30 would just
hit Pike. All right, so, Pike, as you're waiting

2978
03:50:39,945 --> 03:50:45,279
and waiting, all of a sudden you see this surge of
water come splashing across the way towards you.

2979
03:50:45,279 --> 03:50:48,991
You turn-- Make a dexterity check. Or a dexterity
saving throw, sorry.

2980
03:50:48,991 --> 03:50:50,594
LIAM: What's the spell?

2981
03:50:50,594 --> 03:50:53,316
MATT: Tidal Wave. It's what she used to destroy
the elementals.

2982
03:50:53,316 --> 03:50:56,499
MARISHA: Yeah, it's instantaneous so my thing is
still up.

2983
03:50:56,499 --> 03:50:57,746
ASHLEY: 17?

2984
03:50:57,746 --> 03:50:59,082
MARISHA: Fail.

2985
03:50:59,082 --> 03:51:02,546
MATT: So you take 4d6 bludgeoning damage and you
are knocked prone here.

2986
03:51:02,546 --> 03:51:06,262
ASHLEY: 4d6?

2987
03:51:06,262 --> 03:51:15,311
MARISHA: 4d8, so that's eight, 16, 17. Wait, 4d8?
17.

2988
03:51:15,311 --> 03:51:18,880
MATT: 17 points of bludgeoning damage, and you are
knocked prone as the wave crashes over you,

2989
03:51:18,880 --> 03:51:24,264
dissipating into the stonework around, leaving
little puddles that begin to steam and boil upon

2990
03:51:24,264 --> 03:51:28,744
the impact across the ground, even as the sleet
storm is crashing all around you.

2991
03:51:28,744 --> 03:51:30,730
MARISHA: That's my turn.

2992
03:51:30,730 --> 03:51:32,318
MATT: All righty. You're up, Pike.

2993
03:51:32,318 --> 03:51:34,166
MARISHA: And I'm going to tuck back up against my
wall.

2994
03:51:34,166 --> 03:51:35,653
ASHLEY: Okay, so.

2995
03:51:35,653 --> 03:51:50,634
MATT: Okay, at the top of your turn, you need to
make a constitution saving throw.

2996
03:51:50,634 --> 03:51:55,187
MARISHA: Sleet Storm is still up! Sleet Storm!
Sleet Storm!

2997
03:51:55,187 --> 03:51:56,613
ASHLEY: 19.

2998
03:51:56,613 --> 03:51:58,380
MATT: Yeah, so you maintain your armor.

2999
03:51:58,380 --> 03:52:05,620
ASHLEY: Okay. Can I just get up and then go to the
middle part of the walls?

3000
03:52:05,620 --> 03:52:11,769
MATT: You can move there. That's about as far as
you can get with only half your movement left, so.

3001
03:52:11,769 --> 03:52:18,327
ASHLEY: Okay. Can I just start swinging and see if
I can hit him, if he's in there?

3002
03:52:18,327 --> 03:52:22,294
MATT: If you want to. Just make an attack up here?
Okay. Roll an attack.

3003
03:52:22,294 --> 03:52:29,775
ASHLEY: I mean, he's not in there, but, I mean,
28.

3004
03:52:29,775 --> 03:52:32,909
MATT: 28. Whoosh, through the air. Nothing there.

3005
03:52:32,909 --> 03:52:35,213
MARISHA: 28 is such a great roll, too.

3006
03:52:35,213 --> 03:52:37,915
MATT: All right. Is that all you're going to do on
your turn?

3007
03:52:37,915 --> 03:52:41,383
ASHLEY: (sighs) Yeah. Yeah.

3008
03:52:41,383 --> 03:52:43,281
MATT: All right. Vax, you're up.

3009
03:52:43,281 --> 03:52:46,697
LIAM: Okay. I'm telling you what I'm doing right
now. It's interesting.

3010
03:52:46,697 --> 03:53:01,474
MATT: That will drop stealth.

3011
03:53:01,474 --> 03:53:03,167
LIAM: Okay.

3012
03:53:03,167 --> 03:53:05,760
ASHLEY: Do it.

3013
03:53:05,760 --> 03:53:07,050
MARISHA: (whispering) Show your face.

3014
03:53:07,050 --> 03:53:08,423
LIAM: Forget that. Just this.

3015
03:53:08,423 --> 03:53:10,325
MATT: Okay.

3016
03:53:10,325 --> 03:53:16,208
LIAM: You know what I'm talking about, right?

3017
03:53:16,208 --> 03:53:21,079
MATT: Are you holding what you were holding
before? Okay. Okay. Got it. All right, cool. That

3018
03:53:21,079 --> 03:53:23,350
ends Vax's turn. Keyleth, you're up.

3019
03:53:23,350 --> 03:53:34,455
MARISHA: You dickhead. You dick. Okay. I'm going
to pop around the corner again. Do I see Pike at all?

3020
03:53:34,455 --> 03:53:35,825
MATT: No.

3021
03:53:35,825 --> 03:53:37,675
ASHLEY: (whispering) Sorry.

3022
03:53:37,675 --> 03:53:40,036
MATT: Nobody's in view right now.

3023
03:53:40,036 --> 03:53:42,137
(laughter)

3024
03:53:42,137 --> 03:53:46,299
LIAM: Oh, wow. Ah, it's 11:00, it's amazing. This
game is so depressing.

3025
03:53:46,299 --> 03:53:49,873
ASHLEY: I did not know it was-- I was like, "Oh,
yeah, it'll probably be pretty quick."

3026
03:53:49,873 --> 03:53:53,910
MARISHA: I just broke the fucking pen. I just did
a Travis.

3027
03:53:53,910 --> 03:53:55,624
MATT: (laughs) All right, what are you doing,
Keyleth?

3028
03:53:55,624 --> 03:54:04,929
MARISHA: I'm going to do another-- It sucks when
you can't see people. It really fucking sucks. I

3029
03:54:04,929 --> 03:54:11,262
am going to Call Lightning, I guess.

3030
03:54:11,262 --> 03:54:13,914
MATT: Okay. You will lose Sleet Storm. You good
with that?

3031
03:54:13,914 --> 03:54:18,200
MARISHA: (quietly) No, not really.

3032
03:54:18,200 --> 03:54:26,324
MATT: Sleet Storm has been somewhat effectual with
Pike, but she's not moving much. Doesn't seem to

3033
03:54:26,324 --> 03:54:28,084
affect, so it's up to you.

3034
03:54:28,084 --> 03:54:29,491
MARISHA: Okay. Okay, I'll drop it.

3035
03:54:29,491 --> 03:54:32,084
MATT: It can be useful. You drop it and go Call
Lightning. Sleet Storm ceases as suddenly a small

3036
03:54:32,084 --> 03:54:35,817
cloud begins to form at the top of this chamber.
You hear the crackling and rolling thunder as

3037
03:54:35,817 --> 03:54:38,844
little flashes of electrical energy begin to
appear across the ceiling.

3038
03:54:38,844 --> 03:54:48,773
MARISHA: I am going to bring it down here.

3039
03:54:48,773 --> 03:54:55,479
MATT: There? Okay. With that, (thunder). A blast
of lightning hits the floor, smashes into the

3040
03:54:55,479 --> 03:55:02,382
ground, rocks get thrown. No apparent effect. All
right. You going to go back in your corner? All

3041
03:55:02,382 --> 03:55:03,616
right. Pike, you're up.

3042
03:55:03,616 --> 03:55:07,163
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to cast Death Ward on
myself. My last fourth.

3043
03:55:07,163 --> 03:55:14,693
MATT: Last fourth spell. Death Ward on Pike. Boom.
I'm going to wait-- What else are you doing?

3044
03:55:14,693 --> 03:55:24,881
ASHLEY: Okay, so. Ugh, so frustrating because I
can't see him. Can I make a Spiritual Weapon to

3045
03:55:24,881 --> 03:55:27,623
see stealthy people? Like stealth goggles?

3046
03:55:27,623 --> 03:55:33,300
MATT: You can make a Spiritual Weapon that can
move around and be a danger, but can't really make

3047
03:55:33,300 --> 03:55:34,825
it to help you see stuff.

3048
03:55:34,825 --> 03:55:39,753
ASHLEY: I know, I was just trying.

3049
03:55:39,753 --> 03:55:43,007
MATT: I mean, an extra bonus action attack doesn't
hurt if something does show up, so. Up to you.

3050
03:55:43,007 --> 03:55:44,310
What do you want to do?

3051
03:55:44,310 --> 03:55:52,285
ASHLEY: Okay, yeah. I'm going to put a Spiritual
Weapon, just hovering, that sweet sword of Sarenrae.

3052
03:55:52,285 --> 03:55:54,841
MATT: Okay. What level?

3053
03:55:54,841 --> 03:55:56,867
ASHLEY: Second.

3054
03:55:56,867 --> 03:56:01,847
MATT: Okay, so a basic Spiritual Weapon appears.
I'll go with this yellow one. Where do you want it

3055
03:56:01,847 --> 03:56:02,940
to go?

3056
03:56:02,940 --> 03:56:03,996
ASHLEY: Just right above me.

3057
03:56:03,996 --> 03:56:11,744
MATT: Right above you? All right, so that'll be
right there. Okay, that end your turn? All right, suddenly--

3058
03:56:11,744 --> 03:56:13,490
LIAM: (whispering) Aw, dang it.

3059
03:56:13,490 --> 03:56:18,100
MATT: The entirety of the room begins to quake and
shift. You hear the cracking as, all of a sudden,

3060
03:56:18,100 --> 03:56:25,686
every stone wall bursts forth and molten rock
begins to spill into the territory. All the walls,

3061
03:56:25,686 --> 03:56:31,261
now, five feet of lava have filled in. Show me on
the map where you last were?

3062
03:56:31,261 --> 03:56:32,849
LIAM: Where I last was?

3063
03:56:32,849 --> 03:56:33,959
MATT: Yes, show me.

3064
03:56:33,959 --> 03:56:35,379
LIAM: Okay.

3065
03:56:35,379 --> 03:56:46,122
MATT: Okay. I need you to make a dexterity saving
throw. Don't have advantage anymore, because Haste

3066
03:56:46,122 --> 03:56:47,122
is gone.

3067
03:56:47,122 --> 03:56:55,517
LIAM: I know. That is a 30, I think, hold on.

3068
03:56:55,517 --> 03:56:59,684
MATT: Yeah, it's plenty. So you dodge out of the
way just in time, however, you guys watch as all

3069
03:56:59,684 --> 03:57:04,420
the walls now, within five feet of them, are now
just spilling lava and it's filling into the

3070
03:57:04,420 --> 03:57:08,898
room. You get the sense that it's going to
continue to fill with each passing round.

3071
03:57:08,898 --> 03:57:11,417
LIAM: You mean closing in?

3072
03:57:11,417 --> 03:57:13,989
MATT: All the walls are slowly closing in until
the room fills with lava.

3073
03:57:13,989 --> 03:57:16,733
MARISHA: Do we see Vax now?

3074
03:57:16,733 --> 03:57:20,305
MATT: No, you do not. It is now Vax's turn.

3075
03:57:20,305 --> 03:57:23,950
LIAM: Okay, so, Pike is in the little tunnel?

3076
03:57:23,950 --> 03:57:26,571
MATT: From what you can tell. You don't see her.

3077
03:57:26,571 --> 03:57:28,174
LIAM: Well, I'm looking from my spot.

3078
03:57:28,174 --> 03:57:29,534
MATT: You don't see her.

3079
03:57:29,534 --> 03:57:33,165
LIAM: Oh, okay. Right, I don't see her. And I
don't see Keyleth. Okay, so what I want to do--

3080
03:57:33,165 --> 03:57:34,909
ASHLEY: How's it feel?

3081
03:57:34,909 --> 03:57:53,534
LIAM: --is use my action to do that, and use my
bonus to-- Just a little.

3082
03:57:53,534 --> 03:57:58,775
MATT: Okay. All right. Just a little? To where?
Give me specifically. Sorry, guys.

3083
03:57:58,775 --> 03:58:05,476
LIAM: So, here.

3084
03:58:05,476 --> 03:58:16,988
MATT: All right, so. You hear in the distance this
kind of hissing sound. Hand me the sheet real

3085
03:58:16,988 --> 03:58:18,195
fast? So I--

3086
03:58:18,195 --> 03:58:19,908
LIAM: Oh, gosh, yeah.

3087
03:58:19,908 --> 03:58:29,810
MATT: As from around the corner, a tiny serpent
appears and lashes out at you, Keyleth. Simon, a

3088
03:58:29,810 --> 03:58:30,991
very familiar friend.

3089
03:58:30,991 --> 03:58:34,648
MARISHA: Simon! Oh, hey, bud! Hey, friend, what's
up?

3090
03:58:34,648 --> 03:58:38,094
MATT: Rears back and strikes at you, being the
poisonous snake that it is.

3091
03:58:38,094 --> 03:58:40,815
MARISHA: Oh, no, what's the matter, you lost? You
lost, Simon? Oh, don't worry, bud, we're going

3092
03:58:40,815 --> 03:58:44,269
to get out of this okay. Whoa, fuck!

3093
03:58:44,313 --> 03:58:45,852
MATT: Go ahead and roll a d20.

3094
03:58:45,852 --> 03:58:50,381
LIAM: Aw, that's a five.

3095
03:58:50,381 --> 03:58:53,715
MATT: All right. It strikes at you, and you just
kinda step back and go, "Aw, Simon."

3096
03:58:53,715 --> 03:58:57,000
LIAM: She didn't lose any hit points? Oh, it's an
attack roll, got it.

3097
03:58:57,000 --> 03:59:04,719
MATT: But there is now a tiny little snake there.
All righty. That ends your turn. All right.

3098
03:59:04,719 --> 03:59:06,168
Keyleth, you're up.

3099
03:59:06,168 --> 03:59:15,539
MARISHA: Okay, so the walls are coming in. Do I
see a floating weapon?

3100
03:59:15,539 --> 03:59:17,239
MATT: No.

3101
03:59:17,239 --> 03:59:22,051
MARISHA: No? I don't see the floating Sarenrae
weapon or anything?

3102
03:59:22,051 --> 03:59:25,296
MATT: Not really, the wall's too high. The walls
are about ten feet up.

3103
03:59:25,296 --> 03:59:33,770
MARISHA: Okay. I am going to-- Okay, I dropped my
Sleet Storm. I am now going to come through and

3104
03:59:33,770 --> 03:59:38,365
come here. Do I see Vax at all? I'm going to do
another perception check.

3105
03:59:38,365 --> 03:59:40,234
MATT: Perception check as a bonus action.

3106
03:59:40,234 --> 03:59:44,408
MARISHA: Negative. A two. I've been rolling
terribly.

3107
03:59:44,408 --> 03:59:45,642
TALIESIN: Oh my god, again.

3108
03:59:45,642 --> 03:59:57,764
MARISHA: So we're trying, now the lava's caving
in-- I'm going to just hold Blight. I'm going to

3109
03:59:57,764 --> 04:00:01,429
hold my action and see if I see Pike or Vax.

3110
04:00:01,429 --> 04:00:03,607
MATT: Okay. Good to know. All right, Pike, you're
up.

3111
04:00:03,607 --> 04:00:08,589
MARISHA: Blight, or Call Lightning.

3112
04:00:08,589 --> 04:00:11,519
MATT: Blight or Call Lightning. Which one are you
going to do?

3113
04:00:11,519 --> 04:00:15,171
MARISHA: Well, I'm holding my attack action. It
depends on how close they are.

3114
04:00:15,171 --> 04:00:18,758
MATT: Okay. Usually, you tell what spell you're
preparing.

3115
04:00:18,758 --> 04:00:23,325
MARISHA: Well, I have Call Lightning up as a
concentration spell, and Blight is an instant

3116
04:00:23,325 --> 04:00:28,766
action. If I see Pike, I will Call Lightning. If I
see Vax, I will Blight.

3117
04:00:28,766 --> 04:00:30,133
MATT: Okay, good to know.

3118
04:00:30,133 --> 04:00:35,012
ASHLEY: All right, I'm going to move forward to
the front of this little tunnel here, and I'm

3119
04:00:35,012 --> 04:00:45,124
going to stay in there. And then I'm going to move
my spiritual weapon so it stays with me. Or does

3120
04:00:45,124 --> 04:00:46,438
it stay with me?

3121
04:00:46,438 --> 04:00:53,317
MATT: As a bonus action, you can move it 20 feet
and repeat an attack against a creature within

3122
04:00:53,317 --> 04:00:54,566
five feet.

3123
04:00:54,566 --> 04:01:02,859
ASHLEY: And each square is five? Okay, I'll just
keep it with me.

3124
04:01:02,859 --> 04:01:08,392
MATT: Okay, cool. Top of the round! The lava
begins to pool further into the room. You guys

3125
04:01:08,392 --> 04:01:12,771
notice now as molten rock is now beginning to
spill at the ten-foot radius around the walls.

3126
04:01:12,771 --> 04:01:18,950
Pike, it's starting to get close to closing off the
exit of this wall. You see it now beginning to

3127
04:01:18,950 --> 04:01:20,979
spill into this lava form there.

3128
04:01:20,979 --> 04:01:23,450
MARISHA: I have my Wall of Stone up here and
here.

3129
04:01:23,450 --> 04:01:26,071
MATT: Correct. But it's still spilling out of all
the walls on each side.

3130
04:01:26,071 --> 04:01:27,272
MARISHA: Sure, right.

3131
04:01:27,272 --> 04:01:28,718
MATT: You need to make another dexterity check.

3132
04:01:28,718 --> 04:01:30,817
LIAM: Even though I stepped one in?

3133
04:01:30,817 --> 04:01:34,169
MATT: You stepped one in, away from it, and then
it moved in one more.

3134
04:01:34,169 --> 04:01:36,051
LIAM: Okay. Ohh! One.

3135
04:01:36,051 --> 04:01:37,067
MATT: One.

3136
04:01:37,067 --> 04:01:41,307
TALIESIN: Welcome to the club.

3137
04:01:41,307 --> 04:01:59,448
MATT: You take 42 points of fire damage

3138
04:01:59,448 --> 04:02:01,336
TALIESIN: Whoa!

3139
04:02:01,336 --> 04:02:06,030
MATT: As the lava surges past you, you manage to
just step out of the very edge, but a familiar

3140
04:02:06,030 --> 04:02:11,339
sensation hits you as the severe pain you once
held in one foot, you now feel in both. All

3141
04:02:11,339 --> 04:02:14,715
righty! Vax, it's your turn.

3142
04:02:14,715 --> 04:02:23,449
LIAM: Okay. I'm going to materialize. I'll have
gone one, two, three, four, five to here. I'm

3143
04:02:23,449 --> 04:02:24,868
going to throw a dagger--

3144
04:02:24,868 --> 04:02:27,924
MATT: The moment you appear, Keyleth, you get your
Blight spell.

3145
04:02:27,924 --> 04:02:33,780
MARISHA: Hey, baby. Okay.

3146
04:02:33,780 --> 04:02:37,842
LIAM: I haven't walked up to you, but if it's
ranged--

3147
04:02:37,842 --> 04:02:45,151
MATT: No, it's ranged. It's a 30-foot range. As
soon as you appear. No, constitution saving throw.

3148
04:02:45,151 --> 04:02:54,280
LIAM: Constitution. I am doomed, doomed, doomed.
So it's on me right now to roll? Here we go. Ugh,

3149
04:02:54,280 --> 04:02:56,062
it's a big six. Big six.

3150
04:02:56,062 --> 04:02:57,927
MATT: All right, that is 8d8 necrotic damage
against you.

3151
04:02:57,927 --> 04:02:59,529
LIAM: Oh, I'm gone, I'm out.

3152
04:02:59,529 --> 04:03:04,378
MARISHA: Low rolls. Ten, 13--

3153
04:03:04,378 --> 04:03:05,924
MATT: You do have necrotic resistance.

3154
04:03:05,924 --> 04:03:08,415
LIAM: Yeah, still. Still going to get knocked out.

3155
04:03:08,415 --> 04:03:15,227
MARISHA: 28 damage.

3156
04:03:15,227 --> 04:03:17,090
MATT: So 14 points of necrotic damage to you.

3157
04:03:17,090 --> 04:03:19,858
LIAM: I'm down.

3158
04:03:19,858 --> 04:03:20,877
MATT: You're down?

3159
04:03:20,877 --> 04:03:24,545
MATT: As you see Vax appear, dagger in hand,
rushing toward you, you turn and release the

3160
04:03:24,545 --> 04:03:30,152
Blight spell. You see the veins of black curl up
his body as his skin begins to curl and tear open

3161
04:03:30,152 --> 04:03:36,401
in certain places and he falls facedown on the
edge of this lava pool right there, one hand kind

3162
04:03:36,401 --> 04:03:40,729
of like (sizzling), fingers beginning to catch
flame as it just touches the edge of the lava.

3163
04:03:40,729 --> 04:03:46,360
MARISHA: (high-pitched) Sorry! This is like a
nightmare I had.

3164
04:03:46,360 --> 04:03:50,222
(laughter)

3165
04:03:50,222 --> 04:03:54,163
MARISHA: I feel so guilty.

3166
04:03:54,163 --> 04:03:55,998
MATT: All right. Keyleth, it's your turn.

3167
04:03:55,998 --> 04:03:59,613
MARISHA: Okay. Vax is down?

3168
04:03:59,613 --> 04:04:02,196
MATT: Vax is down.

3169
04:04:02,196 --> 04:04:05,178
MARISHA: How sadistic do I want to be?

3170
04:04:05,178 --> 04:04:10,951
MATT: It's up to you. What do you want to do?

3171
04:04:10,951 --> 04:04:18,298
MARISHA: In typical Keyleth fashion, I walk up to
Vax, and I say, so sorry, I'm so sorry, and I push

3172
04:04:18,298 --> 04:04:19,929
him into the lava.

3173
04:04:19,929 --> 04:04:21,672
(laughter)

3174
04:04:21,672 --> 04:04:23,090
LIAM: So what do I do?

3175
04:04:23,090 --> 04:04:27,483
MATT: You don't do anything, as she kicks your
unconscious form into the molten rock, and your

3176
04:04:27,483 --> 04:04:30,711
body slowly burns away.

3177
04:04:30,711 --> 04:04:36,623
LIAM: And the Death Ward does nothing against
that? Death save, advantage, all of that, nothing?

3178
04:04:36,623 --> 04:04:40,860
MATT: This isn't so much about death saving throws
as your unconscious body, unable to do anything,

3179
04:04:40,860 --> 04:04:45,596
is being pushed slowly into molten rock. Vax is no
more.

3180
04:04:45,596 --> 04:04:50,337
MARISHA: Wait, wait wait. I'll never let go. I'll
never let go, Vax!

3181
04:04:50,337 --> 04:04:52,085
LIAM: So stupid, Rose! So stupid, Rose!

3182
04:04:52,085 --> 04:04:57,653
MATT: You watch as the molten rock takes his arm,
as it slowly disappears beneath the lava,

3183
04:04:57,653 --> 04:05:05,376
Marisha, it turns into a middle finger, and
disappears beneath the molten rock.

3184
04:05:05,376 --> 04:05:10,124
LIAM: That's totally on me. I wasn't paying
attention. I heard you say Blight and I should

3185
04:05:10,124 --> 04:05:12,413
have stayed put. That was my mistake.

3186
04:05:12,413 --> 04:05:17,007
MATT: So that's your action, kicking his body into
the lava.

3187
04:05:17,007 --> 04:05:19,031
MARISHA: That was gnarly.

3188
04:05:19,031 --> 04:05:22,867
MATT: What do you want to do now? You still have a
move, and a bonus if you wanted to use it.

3189
04:05:22,867 --> 04:05:24,432
MARISHA: I still have a move and a bonus?

3190
04:05:24,432 --> 04:05:28,582
TALIESIN: Remember, the walls are caving in.

3191
04:05:28,582 --> 04:05:29,985
MARISHA: Yeah, I know.

3192
04:05:29,985 --> 04:05:36,876
MATT: I know you wouldn't sink in lava. It's
fantasy lava. Every time I look over to chat,

3193
04:05:36,876 --> 04:05:38,735
there's just someone-- Ugh.

3194
04:05:38,735 --> 04:05:40,180
LIAM: Guys, it's a game.

3195
04:05:40,180 --> 04:05:44,551
MATT: It's fun. We're having a good time. She
pushed him partially into it and he just burst

3196
04:05:44,551 --> 04:05:47,101
into flames, is what really would have happened,
but it's fine.

3197
04:05:47,101 --> 04:05:49,355
ASHLEY: Down to the ladies!

3198
04:05:49,355 --> 04:06:00,889
MATT: It's all good. The physics in Exandria are
different than your normal mortal realm. All

3199
04:06:00,889 --> 04:06:05,260
right. So. You move over there, and you're done?

3200
04:06:05,322 --> 04:06:15,115
MARISHA: I move over there and still have a bonus,
right? All right. I am going to Healing Word myself.

3201
04:06:15,115 --> 04:06:20,005
MATT: So 1d4 plus six.

3202
04:06:20,005 --> 04:06:23,220
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm just going to do first-level
here, just to top me off.

3203
04:06:23,220 --> 04:06:24,814
MATT: And Pike, you're up after this.

3204
04:06:24,814 --> 04:06:26,987
MARISHA: Four!

3205
04:06:26,987 --> 04:06:28,938
TALIESIN: Ten points.

3206
04:06:28,938 --> 04:06:33,226
MATT: All right. Pike, you're up. Dude, you had a
good game.

3207
04:06:33,226 --> 04:06:35,396
LIAM: Amazing. So much fun.

3208
04:06:35,396 --> 04:06:36,783
TALIESIN: You were metal.

3209
04:06:36,783 --> 04:06:38,786
ASHLEY: I'm going to peek out!

3210
04:06:38,786 --> 04:06:43,926
MATT: All right. You peek around the corner, and
you see Keyleth immediately off across the lava.

3211
04:06:43,926 --> 04:06:50,059
You also see there is lava lapping at your
foot and you can see it moving slowly in your direction.

3212
04:06:50,059 --> 04:06:52,317
ASHLEY: So how far can I move?

3213
04:06:52,317 --> 04:06:57,045
MATT: Well, first off, the sleet spell you let go
for Call Lightning?

3214
04:06:57,045 --> 04:07:00,581
ASHLEY: So how far can I move around right here?

3215
04:07:00,581 --> 04:07:05,770
MATT: That's five, ten. You can move all the way
over here if you want, it's up to you. Or over here.

3216
04:07:05,770 --> 04:07:09,458
ASHLEY: And is there lava over here? Okay, I'm
going to move right here.

3217
04:07:09,458 --> 04:07:19,197
MATT: Okay, you move right there. All right. And
you can use your bonus action to move your blade

3218
04:07:19,197 --> 04:07:23,193
if you want to as well, 20 feet. So you're going
to do that?

3219
04:07:23,193 --> 04:07:25,644
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll do that.

3220
04:07:25,644 --> 04:07:31,567
MATT: Five, ten. Where do you want to go for the
rest of it? Towards Keyleth? 15, 20. It just

3221
04:07:31,567 --> 04:07:33,379
floats over the lava, so it's fine.

3222
04:07:33,379 --> 04:07:40,349
ASHLEY: I am going to cast Harm on Keyleth.

3223
04:07:40,349 --> 04:07:44,265
MARISHA: That sounds horrible. I don't even know
what that is.

3224
04:07:44,265 --> 04:07:48,600
MATT: Oh, you're about to find out is what you're
about to find out! Oh, no. Okay!

3225
04:07:48,600 --> 04:07:52,109
LIAM: While Matt flips, what I was going to do
before I forgot that was stab you in the back, and

3226
04:07:52,109 --> 04:07:54,152
then just wrench you down into the lava.

3227
04:07:54,152 --> 04:08:03,851
MATT: Keyleth, make a constitution saving throw.
(giggling) Oh no...

3228
04:08:03,851 --> 04:08:08,774
ASHLEY: Hey, no, man. This is a good match-up,
though, because--

3229
04:08:08,774 --> 04:08:10,488
LIAM: Three.

3230
04:08:10,488 --> 04:08:14,653
MATT: All right. You take 14d6 necrotic damage.

3231
04:08:14,653 --> 04:08:16,735
TALIESIN: Would you like some extra d6?

3232
04:08:16,735 --> 04:08:19,773
MARISHA: 14d6?

3233
04:08:19,773 --> 04:08:23,445
LIAM: Take my Sneak Attack dice.

3234
04:08:23,445 --> 04:08:33,237
TALIESIN: (counting) There you go. All of that!

3235
04:08:33,237 --> 04:08:36,281
MARISHA: All of them. Roll them all at once. Yes!

3236
04:08:36,281 --> 04:08:42,126
TALIESIN: Wow. Oh my God.

3237
04:08:42,126 --> 04:08:43,739
MATT: Re-roll the cocked one.

3238
04:08:43,739 --> 04:08:48,119
ASHLEY: Oh, that changed that one. Oh well.

3239
04:08:48,119 --> 04:08:49,424
MATT: That's fine.

3240
04:08:49,424 --> 04:08:56,967
ASHLEY: (counting)

3241
04:08:56,967 --> 04:08:59,213
LIAM: I want a fistfight at the end of this.

3242
04:08:59,213 --> 04:09:04,126
MARISHA: Just go out to the parking lot? Take our
shirts off. (rage sound)

3243
04:09:04,126 --> 04:09:05,634
LIAM: Ow, you hit me in the ear!

3244
04:09:05,634 --> 04:09:07,400
MARISHA: Stop pulling my hair!

3245
04:09:07,400 --> 04:09:22,764
ASHLEY: 44.

3246
04:09:22,764 --> 04:09:27,578
MATT: 44 points of necrotic damage. By the way,
your max health is also reduced by 44.

3247
04:09:27,578 --> 04:09:30,734
LIAM: That necrotic stuff hurts, huh?

3248
04:09:30,734 --> 04:09:35,116
MATT: What does that bring you to?

3249
04:09:35,116 --> 04:10:01,650
MARISHA: 31 points. Right? Or 95 minus 44. I way
overcompensated. 51, not 31.

3250
04:10:01,650 --> 04:10:05,945
MATT: 51 hit points. All right, so that's your
Harm spell!

3251
04:10:05,945 --> 04:10:22,968
ASHLEY: Yikes. Okay, and then I'm going to cast--
no, that's all I can do, right? Because I did the

3252
04:10:22,968 --> 04:10:24,719
bonus action to move the Spiritual Weapon?

3253
04:10:24,719 --> 04:10:30,164
MATT: Yep, that's it, you're done. All right,
Keyleth. Top of the round. The lava pools in even

3254
04:10:30,164 --> 04:10:34,969
further, and now three squares away from the wall
are currently filled now, so you guys are starting

3255
04:10:34,969 --> 04:10:39,035
to get pushed into the lava pool in the center.
You probably have two very careful rounds before

3256
04:10:39,035 --> 04:10:42,623
you're both taking lava damage. Yeah, you guys can
see each other. It's right down to this

3257
04:10:42,623 --> 04:10:47,829
lava-filled room, the glow of the molten rock
around you under-lighting you both as you're

3258
04:10:47,829 --> 04:10:52,350
standing in the center around this pool, staring
at one another for the final showdown. You hear

3259
04:10:52,350 --> 04:10:56,783
the laughing of the Beyonder in the distance.
(Doofus-esque voice) "Heh, heh, this is great."

3260
04:10:56,783 --> 04:11:00,119
ASHLEY: Oh gosh, she's going to kill me. She's
going to kill me!

3261
04:11:00,119 --> 04:11:05,946
MARISHA: Okay, so first I want to do, just as my
action, a Call Lightning right onto Pike.

3262
04:11:05,946 --> 04:11:10,000
MATT: All right, Pike, I need you to roll a
dexterity saving throw. Your favorite!

3263
04:11:10,000 --> 04:11:12,422
ASHLEY: Natural 20.

3264
04:11:12,422 --> 04:11:18,930
MATT: Oh, shit. All right.

3265
04:11:18,930 --> 04:11:22,488
MARISHA: The first natural 20 of the night!

3266
04:11:22,488 --> 04:11:25,957
MATT: So roll 3d10 lightning damage, halved.

3267
04:11:25,957 --> 04:11:31,478
ASHLEY: Nice!

3268
04:11:31,478 --> 04:11:33,858
MARISHA: 22. Halved, 11.

3269
04:11:33,858 --> 04:11:39,044
MATT: 11 points of lightning damage. As the
lightning hits you, charging though your body, the

3270
04:11:39,044 --> 04:11:41,148
War Cleric in you fills up with even more rage.

3271
04:11:41,148 --> 04:11:50,809
MARISHA: Now I want to use my bonus action to cast
Blight. Or, sorry, no, to cast Grasping Vine.

3272
04:11:50,809 --> 04:11:56,522
TALIESIN: Oh, shit!

3273
04:11:56,522 --> 04:12:00,052
ASHLEY: I think I'm done. I'm done for, I'm done
for!

3274
04:12:00,052 --> 04:12:11,525
MARISHA: I fucking love lava, by the way. If I
can do it here...

3275
04:12:11,525 --> 04:12:22,241
MATT: All right. So a vine whips out 30 feet.
(counting) Yeah, she's in range.

3276
04:12:22,241 --> 04:12:23,361
ASHLEY: Oh, shit!

3277
04:12:23,361 --> 04:12:27,618
MATT: All right, so, Pike, I need you to make a
dexterity saving throw.

3278
04:12:27,618 --> 04:12:29,040
LIAM: Brutal.

3279
04:12:29,040 --> 04:12:35,076
ASHLEY: Yeah, it gets me.

3280
04:12:35,076 --> 04:12:40,837
MATT: The vine streaks out, black and charred,
almost like the dead forest-type exterior. It

3281
04:12:40,837 --> 04:12:52,567
whips around you and drags you forward 20 feet
into the center of the lava. You take-- (giggling)

3282
04:12:52,567 --> 04:13:13,446
Oh my God. This is not good for you. All right, so
that's 45 points of fire damage.

3283
04:13:13,446 --> 04:13:16,544
ASHLEY: 45. Oh, shit.

3284
04:13:16,544 --> 04:13:21,633
MATT: As you're now being pulled into this hard
but super molten rock shell, your whole body bursts into

3285
04:13:21,633 --> 04:13:27,478
flames as now the flaming fires of righteousness
of Sarenrae are now met by the flaming fires of

3286
04:13:27,478 --> 04:13:31,679
your flesh actually burning off. What are you at,
health-wise?

3287
04:13:31,679 --> 04:13:36,864
ASHLEY: I'm at four. I have Death Ward. Not that
that's probably even going to do anything.

3288
04:13:36,864 --> 04:13:39,481
LIAM: Oh, look, this one's gloating already!

3289
04:13:39,481 --> 04:13:49,712
MATT: Keyleth, that's the end of your turn? All
right, Pike, you're up! Pike, you can move out of

3290
04:13:49,712 --> 04:13:52,578
this, because if you stay in there at the end of
your turn, you're going to take the damage again.

3291
04:13:52,578 --> 04:14:03,301
ASHLEY: (shouting) Fuck! Okay. So. Hmm.

3292
04:14:03,301 --> 04:14:05,941
MATT: The vine's still right there, ready to grab
you again.

3293
04:14:05,941 --> 04:14:09,850
ASHLEY: Okay. Can I take my Spiritual Weapons and
cut off the vines?

3294
04:14:09,850 --> 04:14:19,714
MATT: The Grasping Vine itself is more of an
effect that she can continue, to have more vines

3295
04:14:19,714 --> 04:14:22,567
grow out of it, so it's not going to do much.
You've seen it before, you know how it works.

3296
04:14:22,567 --> 04:14:27,452
ASHLEY: Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.

3297
04:14:27,452 --> 04:14:29,280
MATT: The vine can only pull towards it.

3298
04:14:29,280 --> 04:14:31,593
MARISHA: That's true. It's not a grapple.

3299
04:14:31,593 --> 04:14:35,189
MATT: Yeah. So if you were to move towards the
vine, it wouldn't be able to pull you into the

3300
04:14:35,189 --> 04:14:36,496
lava again, essentially.

3301
04:14:36,496 --> 04:14:38,883
ASHLEY: So I need to get out. Yeah, I'm going to
get out.

3302
04:14:38,883 --> 04:14:40,367
MATT: Which direction?

3303
04:14:40,367 --> 04:14:43,972
ASHLEY: Where is the lava now?

3304
04:14:43,972 --> 04:14:48,656
MATT: The vine's right there. The lava has now
pooled into here. You're only really going to have

3305
04:14:48,656 --> 04:14:50,650
this space and this space.

3306
04:14:50,650 --> 04:14:57,186
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'll just crawl out towards her.
I'm done. I'm done! I can't do anything.

3307
04:14:57,186 --> 04:14:59,191
LIAM: You've still got high AC.

3308
04:14:59,191 --> 04:15:02,908
ASHLEY: Do I still have a spell?

3309
04:15:02,908 --> 04:15:10,074
MATT: Yeah! You haven't done anything. All you did
was move. As a bonus action, you could move this

3310
04:15:10,074 --> 04:15:13,355
over to attack her, if you wanted to.

3311
04:15:13,355 --> 04:15:15,101
ASHLEY: In addition to doing something else?

3312
04:15:15,101 --> 04:15:20,770
MATT: Yeah, as a bonus action. Although it is a
concentration spell, and I need you to roll

3313
04:15:20,770 --> 04:15:24,639
against 44 points of damage. Roll a constitution
check.

3314
04:15:24,639 --> 04:15:28,911
ASHLEY: Okay. 19.

3315
04:15:28,911 --> 04:15:34,600
MATT: Plus your constitution? Oh, with your
constitution? Nah. Spiritual Weapon is gone.

3316
04:15:34,600 --> 04:15:40,168
ASHLEY: Okay, so, shit. I've got to play this
correctly. You're 51?

3317
04:15:40,168 --> 04:15:54,195
LIAM: Got anything that can put her in the pool?
Your biggest damage, right there.

3318
04:15:54,195 --> 04:15:58,856
MARISHA: It's like a pool party wrestling match.

3319
04:15:58,856 --> 04:16:04,471
TALIESIN: Sear your shame. Lock in the flavor.

3320
04:16:04,471 --> 04:16:14,738
ASHLEY: Okay, so I do have a 3rd-level. Can I
throw her ass into the lava?

3321
04:16:14,738 --> 04:16:24,774
MATT: If you wanted to try and shove her, there is
lava right behind her there.

3322
04:16:24,774 --> 04:16:36,792
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to try and shove her with
my-- No! I'm going to Command her to jump into the

3323
04:16:36,792 --> 04:16:38,278
pool of lava.

3324
04:16:38,278 --> 04:16:40,066
MATT: You can Command one word.

3325
04:16:40,066 --> 04:16:41,825
LIAM: Swim.

3326
04:16:41,825 --> 04:16:44,212
TALIESIN: Don't help! Don't help.

3327
04:16:44,212 --> 04:16:53,990
ASHLEY: Yeah. How do I word this? What's the word?
Jump? Ah, fuck.

3328
04:16:53,990 --> 04:17:00,512
MATT: You can try. Let me see here. Let me look at
this real fast.

3329
04:17:00,512 --> 04:17:02,291
LIAM: What does that penguin say? Slide?

3330
04:17:02,291 --> 04:17:09,958
MARISHA: Slide! Now slide, now slide. Now dip,
baby, dip.

3331
04:17:09,958 --> 04:17:16,868
MATT: It has no effect if your command is directly
harmful to it, so it wouldn't work.

3332
04:17:16,868 --> 04:17:21,162
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'll just shove her back into the
lava that's behind her.

3333
04:17:21,162 --> 04:17:23,003
LIAM: Hold on, let me take my earrings off.

3334
04:17:23,003 --> 04:17:24,894
ASHLEY: I mean, what can I do at this point?

3335
04:17:24,894 --> 04:17:37,964
MATT: This is going to be interesting. All right,
so you move into here. Well, you can probably do

3336
04:17:37,964 --> 04:17:43,260
it from here, because technically you're both
adjacent at this point. Go ahead and you can make

3337
04:17:43,260 --> 04:17:44,882
a shove as your attack.

3338
04:17:44,882 --> 04:17:49,835
ASHLEY: Yeah, I don't know how to do that. Or I
can use my Frostbrand.

3339
04:17:49,835 --> 04:17:54,620
MATT: Make a strength (athletics) check.

3340
04:17:54,620 --> 04:18:05,928
ASHLEY: Okay. Strength and athletics? Okay, so
16.

3341
04:18:05,928 --> 04:18:09,472
MATT: All right, you can roll either an athletics or an
acrobatics check, Keyleth.

3342
04:18:09,472 --> 04:18:18,024
MARISHA: I'll take athletics for that. 14.

3343
04:18:18,024 --> 04:18:23,392
MATT: Pike rushes around the corner with her
shield and slams into you. You get pushed back

3344
04:18:23,392 --> 04:18:28,468
into the lava that has curled out from that side.

3345
04:18:28,468 --> 04:18:33,740
MARISHA: Oh, hot. Oh, hot hot hot.

3346
04:18:33,740 --> 04:18:57,435
MATT: Let's see. Yeah, okay, so Keyleth takes, as
part of this action, 19, 29, 35 points of fire

3347
04:18:57,435 --> 04:18:59,409
damage from the shove.

3348
04:18:59,409 --> 04:19:08,366
MARISHA: I'm alive, I'm alive.

3349
04:19:08,366 --> 04:19:13,960
MATT: You're alive? All right. Pike, does that end
your turn?

3350
04:19:13,960 --> 04:19:16,082
ASHLEY: Yeah, there's nothing else I can do,
right?

3351
04:19:16,082 --> 04:19:23,409
MATT: You haven't used your bonus action yet, I
don't think. You used your action to shove.

3352
04:19:23,409 --> 04:19:31,526
ASHLEY: And I can't use a 7th-level, correct? If
it's a bonus action?

3353
04:19:31,526 --> 04:19:33,193
It's a bonus action.

3354
04:19:33,193 --> 04:19:37,230
MARISHA: A 7th-level spell? You have a bonus
action 7th-level spell? What the fuck?

3355
04:19:37,230 --> 04:19:38,625
MATT: What spell is it?

3356
04:19:38,625 --> 04:19:40,233
ASHLEY: Divine Word.

3357
04:19:40,233 --> 04:19:48,874
MATT: Divine Word. Let me pull this up real fast.
Divine Word is a bonus action, yeah. (laughs in surprise)

3358
04:19:48,874 --> 04:19:50,884
Okay, yeah, you can do this!

3359
04:19:50,884 --> 04:19:54,542
ASHLEY: I can?

3360
04:19:54,542 --> 04:19:59,767
MATT: You can, yeah. Because you used your action
to shove. All right, Keyleth, I need you to make a

3361
04:19:59,767 --> 04:20:01,299
charisma saving throw.

3362
04:20:01,299 --> 04:20:03,475
MARISHA: (sarcastically) Oh, my strongest points!

3363
04:20:03,475 --> 04:20:09,351
MATT: (laughs) I know.

3364
04:20:09,351 --> 04:20:12,470
MARISHA: Plus three. Nine.

3365
04:20:12,470 --> 04:20:13,984
MATT: How many hit points are you at?

3366
04:20:13,984 --> 04:20:14,992
MARISHA: 16.

3367
04:20:14,992 --> 04:20:17,566
MATT: Ashley, how do you want to do this?

3368
04:20:17,566 --> 04:20:21,500
MARISHA: Oh! Shut up!

3369
04:20:21,500 --> 04:20:25,676
MATT: So, how Divine Word works: "You utter a
Divine Word, imbued with the power that shaped the

3370
04:20:25,676 --> 04:20:30,079
"world at the dawn of Creation." Because clerics.
"Choose any number of creatures you can see within

3371
04:20:30,079 --> 04:20:33,330
"range. Each creature that can hear you must make a
charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a

3372
04:20:33,330 --> 04:20:36,332
"creature suffers an effect based on its hit
points." 50 or lower, they're deafened for a

3373
04:20:36,332 --> 04:20:41,243
minute. 40 or lower, they're deafened and blinded
for ten minutes. 30 or lower, they're blinded,

3374
04:20:41,243 --> 04:20:47,588
deafened, and stunned for an hour. 20 hit points
or lower: killed instantly. Ashley, how do you

3375
04:20:47,588 --> 04:20:49,299
want to do this?

3376
04:20:49,299 --> 04:20:54,527
ASHLEY: All right. I'm going to walk over to her,
because she's down, right?

3377
04:20:54,527 --> 04:20:56,107
MATT: She's in the lava right now.

3378
04:20:56,107 --> 04:20:58,013
MARISHA: I'm in the lava just screaming bloody
murder.

3379
04:20:58,013 --> 04:21:05,473
ASHLEY: I'm going to just touch her hair, and I'm
going to say (tender voice) I'm sorry, but I need

3380
04:21:05,473 --> 04:21:08,190
to kill you. And smoosh her face into the lava!

3381
04:21:08,190 --> 04:21:10,644
(laughter)

3382
04:21:10,644 --> 04:21:16,050
MATT: As you slam her head down, radiant, divine
energy fills the space around you, and then curls

3383
04:21:16,050 --> 04:21:23,413
dark as you push your friend face-down into the
lava. You hear her screams muffled as the molten

3384
04:21:23,413 --> 04:21:28,429
rock begins to consume her hair, burning off her
head, the divine energy protecting you from the

3385
04:21:28,429 --> 04:21:34,341
heat. As you pull back suddenly, this smoldering,
smoky ruin that was once Keyleth begins to slowly

3386
04:21:34,341 --> 04:21:42,531
melt away against the tide of lava. The pouring
rock halts in place as a voice goes, "And... I

3387
04:21:42,531 --> 04:21:48,003
"have my victor!" Suddenly, the lava right behind
you tears open, and you find yourself falling,

3388
04:21:48,003 --> 04:21:54,457
plummeting into darkness, and the plummeting turns
into just falling and falling, then light begins

3389
04:21:54,457 --> 04:21:59,144
to fill the space beneath you, and you look down
as a small platform of marble approaches you. You

3390
04:21:59,144 --> 04:22:03,241
think you're about to crash into it at full
terminal velocity. Instead, your feet gingerly

3391
04:22:03,241 --> 04:22:09,662
touch, and you come to stand there. The same
strange, white-clad, jheri curl-haired gentleman

3392
04:22:09,662 --> 04:22:14,495
walks up to you and goes, "Well played!" and
high-fives you. "I'll send you on back. Your

3393
04:22:14,495 --> 04:22:18,797
"friends are fine!" and then you see the corpses of
your three friends rise up out of the marble,

3394
04:22:18,797 --> 04:22:20,743
still as wrecked as they were from the battle.

3395
04:22:20,743 --> 04:22:23,107
ASHLEY: Hi. Sorry!

3396
04:22:23,107 --> 04:22:30,166
LIAM: We're really more of a co-mingled milkshake.
We'll be together forever!

3397
04:22:30,166 --> 04:22:32,693
MATT: It's a little disturbing. He hasn't restored
them to their actual form. They all start

3398
04:22:32,693 --> 04:22:37,774
shambling towards you. He goes, "Oh, sorry about
that. Er, this was a dream!" Snaps, and he goes to darkness.

3399
04:22:37,774 --> 04:22:39,944
Well done! Congratulations!

3400
04:22:39,944 --> 04:22:42,044
(cheering)

3401
04:22:42,044 --> 04:22:43,508
LIAM: The monstah!

3402
04:22:43,508 --> 04:22:49,639
ASHLEY: The monstah! Oh, down to the
nitty-gritties!

3403
04:22:49,639 --> 04:22:55,066
MATT: Four hit points, the lava pushing in, that
was crazy! I didn't realize that was a bonus action!

3404
04:22:55,066 --> 04:22:58,540
ASHLEY: I didn't realize it was a bonus action
until you were like, you have a bonus action, and

3405
04:22:58,540 --> 04:23:01,217
I looked down, and I was like, okay, well. Oh,
shit.

3406
04:23:01,217 --> 04:23:06,516
MARISHA: Had you rolled a few points higher on
that lava, she would have been dead. Or had I

3407
04:23:06,516 --> 04:23:07,936
rolled higher on my Lightning.

3408
04:23:07,936 --> 04:23:10,940
ASHLEY: With Death Ward, would that have done
anything, or no?

3409
04:23:10,940 --> 04:23:12,381
MATT: It would have brought you back to one.

3410
04:23:12,381 --> 04:23:16,509
ASHLEY: Okay, so I would have still had that one
hit point.

3411
04:23:16,509 --> 04:23:21,514
LIAM: Also, when you cast that Blight on me, I had
14 hit points. Whatever number of hit points I had

3412
04:23:21,514 --> 04:23:23,120
is what you hit me for.

3413
04:23:23,120 --> 04:23:30,411
MATT: (laughing) Oh, that sucks. You put necrotic
resistance specifically because you were afraid of

3414
04:23:30,411 --> 04:23:32,055
Blight. Yeah.

3415
04:23:32,055 --> 04:23:34,315
LIAM: By the way, she texted me today, going, "But
I won't use that on you, I promise."

3416
04:23:34,315 --> 04:23:36,456
(laughter)

3417
04:23:36,456 --> 04:23:39,920
MARISHA: Oh, I totally did say that, didn't I?

3418
04:23:39,920 --> 04:23:42,637
LIAM: Yeah. No, I knew that you were a liar.
Liar.

3419
04:23:42,637 --> 04:23:45,316
MARISHA: If it makes you feel better, I kind of
forgot about it, between now and then.

3420
04:23:45,316 --> 04:23:46,990
(laughter)

3421
04:23:46,990 --> 04:23:52,870
ASHLEY: Travis just texted me and said, "I am so
proud." My buddy!

3422
04:23:52,870 --> 04:23:57,016
MATT: Aww.

3423
04:23:57,016 --> 04:24:01,306
ASHLEY: Wow. I was not expecting that.

3424
04:24:01,306 --> 04:24:05,460
MARISHA: So, wait, I have a question. My armor has
spell resistance, which gives me advantage on

3425
04:24:05,460 --> 04:24:06,970
saving throws?

3426
04:24:06,970 --> 04:24:10,519
MATT: Spell resistance gives you advantage on
spell saving throws, yes.

3427
04:24:10,519 --> 04:24:13,604
MARISHA: But that wouldn't have helped against her
thing, just now?

3428
04:24:13,604 --> 04:24:15,500
MATT: No, it would've. Yep.

3429
04:24:15,500 --> 04:24:17,394
MARISHA: But I didn't have to roll to save.

3430
04:24:17,394 --> 04:24:20,942
MATT: It was a charisma saving throw.

3431
04:24:20,942 --> 04:24:23,683
MARISHA: Oh my God, it was a charisma saving
throw! I would have had advantage!

3432
04:24:23,683 --> 04:24:26,721
MATT: Roll again. The outcome's already happened,
but.

3433
04:24:26,721 --> 04:24:28,743
MARISHA: It's already happened. I rolled an 18!

3434
04:24:28,743 --> 04:24:30,096
MATT: What was your charisma bonus?

3435
04:24:30,096 --> 04:24:31,903
MARISHA: Plus three, so 21.

3436
04:24:31,903 --> 04:24:34,388
MATT: Your charisma saving throw bonus is plus
three?

3437
04:24:34,388 --> 04:24:40,884
MARISHA: Yeah, because I have the Ring of
Protection. I gain a plus two bonus to AC and

3438
04:24:40,884 --> 04:24:41,879
saving throws.

3439
04:24:41,879 --> 04:24:44,429
MATT: Well, this is a valuable lesson in
remembering what your spells can do.

3440
04:24:44,429 --> 04:24:46,759
MARISHA: What my armor does, yeah. So I would have
saved against that?

3441
04:24:46,759 --> 04:24:47,866
MATT: Possibly, yeah.

3442
04:24:47,866 --> 04:24:51,926
MARISHA: Fucking fuck! A 21. I would have saved.

3443
04:24:51,926 --> 04:24:53,090
ASHLEY: You would have saved.

3444
04:24:53,090 --> 04:24:54,031
MATT: It was an epic end.

3445
04:24:54,031 --> 04:25:00,796
LIAM: But you also accidentally benefited from something we
weren't supposed to. At some point.

3446
04:25:00,796 --> 04:25:02,275
MARISHA: At some point, yeah, I'm sure.

3447
04:25:02,275 --> 04:25:06,933
MATT: It all balances out. It all comes out in the
wash. That Divine, man, that's such a cool ability.

3448
04:25:06,933 --> 04:25:09,505
MARISHA: Man, that's funny.

3449
04:25:09,505 --> 04:25:10,817
LIAM: That was exhilarating!

3450
04:25:10,817 --> 04:25:13,682
ASHLEY: Gosh, that was down to the end!

3451
04:25:13,682 --> 04:25:16,436
TALIESIN: I've got to think up better ways to kill
you.

3452
04:25:16,436 --> 04:25:21,415
LIAM: I'm surprised no one went into the lava
until the very, very end, too.

3453
04:25:21,415 --> 04:25:27,991
TALIESIN: I had plans, but you scared everybody
into the corners. The minute you vanished, it just

3454
04:25:27,991 --> 04:25:32,027
changed everything. The minute anybody had walked
in front of that, I had a ten-foot push.

3455
04:25:32,027 --> 04:25:36,248
LIAM: I feel like I would have lost momentum right
away, if I hadn't gone into stealth.

3456
04:25:36,248 --> 04:25:43,547
MARISHA: Had I saved, my next move was going to be
a thunder blast, to try and push you into the lava.

3457
04:25:43,547 --> 04:25:45,444
ASHLEY: I would have been done-zo.

3458
04:25:45,444 --> 04:25:47,304
MARISHA: It came very close!

3459
04:25:47,304 --> 04:25:48,634
ASHLEY: Good job!

3460
04:25:48,634 --> 04:25:51,871
ALL: Good game.

3461
04:25:51,871 --> 04:25:55,136
MATT: But be aware that she still had Death Ward,
so even if you did hit her with that--

3462
04:25:55,136 --> 04:25:59,271
MARISHA: She would have had to come back. Back up
with one hit point, and then would have done it again.

3463
04:25:59,271 --> 04:26:09,223
MATT: Done something else, yes. Either way, that
was an epic end. Man, cleric victory, both Battle

3464
04:26:09,223 --> 04:26:10,416
Royales we've had.

3465
04:26:10,416 --> 04:26:13,171
MARISHA: Cleric victory! Clerics are badass in
general.

3466
04:26:13,171 --> 04:26:15,351
MATT: Yeah, everyone out there is like, "Eh, I
don't want to play a cleric."

3467
04:26:15,351 --> 04:26:18,448
TALIESIN: Clerics. Two rounds, now.

3468
04:26:18,448 --> 04:26:20,023
ASHLEY: Because you can heal yourself!

3469
04:26:20,023 --> 04:26:23,512
MATT: Yeah. That saved you! Staying off to the
side and healing yourself with your bonus actions

3470
04:26:23,512 --> 04:26:24,894
and stuff, when no one was around?

3471
04:26:24,894 --> 04:26:26,833
ASHLEY: Yeah, I was like I'll just build up and
then--

3472
04:26:26,833 --> 04:26:28,359
MATT: Hey, man, that's what saved you.

3473
04:26:28,359 --> 04:26:33,138
LIAM: It got so dirty at the end. So dirty and
nasty.

3474
04:26:33,138 --> 04:26:41,470
MARISHA: You guys did a lot of damage to my stone
form up front, but someone almost brought me down.

3475
04:26:41,470 --> 04:26:44,688
I was at six hit points and I stayed at six hit
points for a long time.

3476
04:26:44,688 --> 04:26:50,546
TALIESIN: I know, I was about to-- That was when
my gun broke. I was about to get you to drop, and

3477
04:26:50,546 --> 04:26:51,661
then the gun broke.

3478
04:26:51,661 --> 04:26:56,891
MARISHA: Yeah, you were about to drop me. I ended
up dropping it myself because at this point it was

3479
04:26:56,891 --> 04:27:01,858
turning into a Mexican standoff and I couldn't do
anything, and I can't cast spells when I'm in an

3480
04:27:01,858 --> 04:27:03,188
earth elemental form.

3481
04:27:03,188 --> 04:27:04,659
MATT: Yeah. Well done, guys.

3482
04:27:04,659 --> 04:27:09,059
LIAM: My time was up. Even if the Blight hadn't
gotten me, without Haste, I was going to start

3483
04:27:09,059 --> 04:27:12,924
getting seen more often, and I was low, and you
guys had plenty of frigging spells left at that

3484
04:27:12,924 --> 04:27:14,428
point. I would've been toast.

3485
04:27:14,428 --> 04:27:15,896
MARISHA: I was just running out of options.

3486
04:27:15,896 --> 04:27:20,812
MATT: You guys were down to the wire, as far as
spell options.

3487
04:27:20,812 --> 04:27:28,199
MARISHA: I was down to the wire, because I burned
7th-level on Firestorm, 6th-level on Sunbeam,

3488
04:27:28,199 --> 04:27:34,324
which only did half damage on him once, so that
wasn't great. I still had a 5th-level spell left,

3489
04:27:34,324 --> 04:27:39,044
and one 4th-level. I burned through all my
3rd-levels.

3490
04:27:39,044 --> 04:27:43,304
LIAM: One day you guys will get the whole group.

3491
04:27:43,304 --> 04:27:46,202
MATT: One day. All of Vox Machina.

3492
04:27:46,202 --> 04:27:47,275
MARISHA: And it'll be an eight-hour fight!

3493
04:27:47,275 --> 04:27:49,967
ASHLEY: Yeah, that would be the longest fight
ever.

3494
04:27:49,967 --> 04:27:55,954
MATT: No. You have to understand, you guys had a
lot of stand-away characters in this. Throwing

3495
04:27:55,954 --> 04:28:01,585
Grog in the mix changes everything very quickly.
He can move quickly and tear your face off

3496
04:28:01,585 --> 04:28:10,958
quickly. And having Vex over there, who does a
shit-ton of damage from a distance. And Sam of

3497
04:28:10,958 --> 04:28:15,852
course being Sam. Having all of you guys in one
arena, fighting? I'm looking forward to it. It's

3498
04:28:15,852 --> 04:28:17,758
going to be a real crazy fight when it happens.

3499
04:28:17,758 --> 04:28:23,159
MARISHA: Sam would be tough to square off against.
He'd be another one to get me down to the wire.

3500
04:28:23,159 --> 04:28:30,254
MATT: And he's got War Caster, so he gets
advantage on his concentration checks, too.

3501
04:28:30,254 --> 04:28:36,005
MARISHA: It's tough, too, because a lot of it
comes down to order, after a while. It comes down

3502
04:28:36,005 --> 04:28:37,295
to turn order.

3503
04:28:37,295 --> 04:28:45,222
ASHLEY: Shit, I always forget that I have
advantages on charisma saving throws. Advantage on

3504
04:28:45,222 --> 04:28:47,256
all intelligence, wisdom, and charisma saving
throws.

3505
04:28:47,256 --> 04:28:52,500
TALIESIN: I know that your strength is
artificially increased. Does that artificially

3506
04:28:52,500 --> 04:29:01,152
increase your skill sets, too? So actually,
technically, your athletics should be four.

3507
04:29:01,152 --> 04:29:04,818
ASHLEY: Oh, shit, so I probably would have rolled
a little higher on some of these.

3508
04:29:04,818 --> 04:29:06,740
MATT: It's fine. You still succeeded.

3509
04:29:06,740 --> 04:29:09,593
MARISHA: It all balances out.

3510
04:29:09,593 --> 04:29:11,062
MATT: Everyone's saying "Happy Birthday, Liam and
Laura!"

3511
04:29:11,062 --> 04:29:12,377
ALL: Happy Birthday!

3512
04:29:12,377 --> 04:29:19,060
MATT: Yeah, they're all wishing you Happy
Birthday!

3513
04:29:19,060 --> 04:29:20,406
LIAM: Thank you!

3514
04:29:20,406 --> 04:29:29,769
MARISHA: If I hear one more "Read Your Spells,"
people, I am going to murder somebody. No more! No

3515
04:29:29,769 --> 04:29:36,165
more read your spells or read your sheets. There's
a lot to keep track of! This is my binder. Look at

3516
04:29:36,165 --> 04:29:37,942
all this!

3517
04:29:37,942 --> 04:29:41,262
TALIESIN: You don't have other stuff to deal with,
either.

3518
04:29:41,262 --> 04:29:44,417
MARISHA: Yeah, it's not like I have three
full-time jobs.

3519
04:29:44,417 --> 04:29:51,135
MATT: Nah, it's all good. Well, guys, thank you so
much for watching. I hope you had as much fun as

3520
04:29:51,135 --> 04:29:57,904
we did on this. We'll be back on the actual set,
once it'll be finished, next week, for the

3521
04:29:57,904 --> 04:30:04,047
continuation of the showdown with Umbrasyl and Vox
Machina, in which our buddy here, Liam, and Sam

3522
04:30:04,047 --> 04:30:09,927
are both currently inside the dragon, with Grog
dragging behind, and it looks like we may have a

3523
04:30:09,927 --> 04:30:19,664
guest player next week as well. Also, next
Wednesday, I'll be at Meltdown Comics, streaming

3524
04:30:19,664 --> 04:30:25,465
with Wizards of the Coast, the official Dungeons &amp;
Dragons guys, unveiling their new lineup of D&amp;D

3525
04:30:25,465 --> 04:30:31,601
stuff, and unveiling a new, cool project that I've
been kind of developing with them and a few other

3526
04:30:31,601 --> 04:30:35,994
guests. Ashley, you saw, was announced as
one of them. She's playing as our cleric in the

3527
04:30:35,994 --> 04:30:42,294
group there. We also have Brian Posehn who was
announced, the fantastic comedian/actor/writer.

3528
04:30:42,294 --> 04:30:45,157
He's going to be there, and we have a few other
cool surprise guests that will be

3529
04:30:45,157 --> 04:30:50,078
announced in the near future. Anyway, that's next
Wednesday. Look for the info at the official D&amp;D

3530
04:30:50,244 --> 04:30:58,006
twitter. Until then, guys, have a wonderful night,
rest well, and is it Thursday yet? Goodnight, guys!
