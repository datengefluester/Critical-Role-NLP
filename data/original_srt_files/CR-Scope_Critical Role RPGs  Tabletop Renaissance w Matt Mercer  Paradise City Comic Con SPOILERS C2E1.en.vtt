NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:36.113
[jazzy music]

00:00:36.113 --> 00:00:40.113
(cheering)

00:00:40.113 --> 00:00:48.396
MATT: Hi! That was-- hi. Good to see you guys.
Thank you all for coming and welcome to our panel

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:50.487
about nerdy-ass D&D discussions.

00:00:50.487 --> 00:00:54.255
(cheering)

00:00:54.255 --> 00:00:59.444
MATT: I'm going to take a seat for a second then
I'll probably sit at the front of the table

00:00:59.444 --> 00:01:06.736
because this seems a little formal to me. Welcome,
everyone! If you don't know who I am, my name is

00:01:06.736 --> 00:01:15.149
Matthew Mercer, I'm a voice actor, Los Angeles,
California and I'm a huge nerd. I've been playing

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:23.560
D&D and other RPGs most of my life, both video
game and tabletop. In recent years, have had

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:30.148
something weird in my life happen where a lot of
other people have gotten invested in my D&D game

00:01:30.148 --> 00:01:37.361
as much as I am. It's been incredible. I have a
show called Critical Role.

00:01:37.361 --> 00:01:42.777
(cheering)

00:01:42.777 --> 00:01:46.236
MATT: Me and a bunch of other nerdy-ass voice
actors that are friends of mine began playing at

00:01:46.236 --> 00:01:52.106
home privately years ago. We were asked to stream
it on Twitch, and now coming up on our third year

00:01:52.106 --> 00:01:53.417
anniversary, which is crazy.

00:01:53.417 --> 00:01:56.480
AUDIENCE MEMBER: And many more!

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:05.427
MATT: Yeah, we're not going anywhere. I mean,
cameras or not, we're still playing. For now,

00:02:05.427 --> 00:02:11.991
everything's pretty kosher. We started streaming
it, and we were very scared to stream it because

00:02:11.991 --> 00:02:17.240
when you put anything you love on the internet,
it's a dangerous, scary thing. Especially tabletop

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:25.607
gaming, which had been a largely misunderstood
genre and hobby for a long time. The idea of doing

00:02:25.607 --> 00:02:32.090
it so people could just watch it seemed like
folly. I was like, "No one's going to-- this is

00:02:32.248 --> 00:02:35.907
"just opening us up to everyone telling us how
terrible we are and to go away." Thankfully, I was

00:02:35.907 --> 00:02:41.225
very wrong for the most part. There's still that
factor, and I expect that. That's fine. We've

00:02:41.225 --> 00:02:48.062
found this incredible community of people that not
just watch our adventures and are invested in our

00:02:48.062 --> 00:02:54.158
adventures, and do stories, and art, but go off
and create their own, which is what I really want

00:02:54.158 --> 00:03:00.227
to was use it as a platform to empower other
people to create their own adventures. To find a

00:03:00.227 --> 00:03:05.577
new hobby they didn't know was out there or didn't
understand how to get into or rediscover it

00:03:05.577 --> 00:03:08.836
because it had been a long time since they had
given themselves permission as an adult to get

00:03:08.836 --> 00:03:15.227
back into it. Then doing so, find incredible
friend groups and reconnect and find, in my

00:03:15.227 --> 00:03:20.668
opinion, is one of the best uses of your social
time with a close group of friends. There's really

00:03:20.668 --> 00:03:25.586
no experience like playing a tabletop RPG, in my
opinion. It's been really amazing and I feel like

00:03:25.586 --> 00:03:30.366
a proud papa, seeing all these people out there
who either got into D&D through our show, or other

00:03:30.366 --> 00:03:34.997
streaming services, got back into it and they tell
me about their adventures, and their characters.

00:03:34.997 --> 00:03:41.435
Sometimes for a while. But that's cool, because
that was me for a long time. They'd be like, "You

00:03:41.435 --> 00:03:47.377
"play D&D?" I'd be like, "Oh yeah! Let me tell you
about my dwarf fighter!" And they slowly turn to

00:03:47.377 --> 00:03:55.359
ash. It's been incredible. These recent years,
seeing what this panel's about, the tabletop

00:03:55.688 --> 00:04:00.448
renaissance that a lot of people are talking
about, is seeing what was once a hobby that had

00:04:00.448 --> 00:04:05.619
difficulty being understood, being respected in a
lot spaces for many of years, and suffered through

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:13.538
the Satanic panic of the 80s. Recently, thanks to
things like Stranger Things, thanks to Twitch and

00:04:13.538 --> 00:04:19.627
live play introductions that have been going for
years, even before we started ours, now into other

00:04:19.627 --> 00:04:24.307
forms of media. It's not just being proud to say
that you play Dungeons & Dragons, but more and

00:04:24.307 --> 00:04:28.256
more people are asking, "I've always wanted to get
into that. Do you know anybody or do you know how

00:04:28.256 --> 00:04:34.338
I can learn?" We have great people like Matt
Colville who are doing YouTube channels about how

00:04:34.338 --> 00:04:44.239
easy it is. Colville! How easy it can be to run a
game and all aspects of it that I know I was very

00:04:44.435 --> 00:04:49.943
scared of as I got older and tried to dive into
it. Now is great time to learn and a great time to

00:04:49.943 --> 00:04:56.211
dive into it. It's super exciting. I'm super
excited. We had a very emotional end to our last

00:04:56.211 --> 00:05:03.728
campaign in October. A game that we ran for five
years. Characters that we, in many cases, lived

00:05:03.728 --> 00:05:08.431
and breathed to the point where, you guys didn't
see this, but before we went live last Thursday,

00:05:08.431 --> 00:05:13.939
Travis turns to Taliesin across the table and
went, "Percy, I was--" and we all slowly turned to

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:21.368
Travis and said, "Did you just call him Percy?" That's
when we realized that it was probably best that we

00:05:21.368 --> 00:05:26.950
ended the last campaign. We're starting to blur
that line a little intensely. No end of shit going

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:33.728
forward for that. We ended that campaign, it was
very emotional. For the past few months, it's been

00:05:33.728 --> 00:05:36.126
a lot of preparation for the new campaign, which we
just started.

00:05:36.126 --> 00:05:42.746
(cheering and applause)

00:05:42.997 --> 00:05:46.916
MATT: Which was a very nerve wracking experience
to build for. Are you--

00:05:46.916 --> 00:05:47.686
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:05:47.686 --> 00:05:48.596
MATT: Are you?!

00:05:48.596 --> 00:05:58.548
(cheering and applause)

00:05:58.548 --> 00:06:06.149
MATT: See now, that's some devil magic, right
there! We have officially, from what I've seen in

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:11.113
person, the first full cosplay of one of our
characters! Two days after!

00:06:11.113 --> 00:06:15.545
(cheering)

00:06:15.545 --> 00:06:17.347
MATT: Jester, stand up and take a bow!

00:06:17.347 --> 00:06:29.216
(cheering)

00:06:29.216 --> 00:06:30.100
MATT: What's your name?

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.957
ARIANA: Ariana!

00:06:30.957 --> 00:06:34.148
MATT: Ariana, amazing job! That's awesome!

00:06:34.148 --> 00:06:35.351
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Take a picture for Laura!

00:06:35.351 --> 00:06:39.207
MATT: Oh my god! Oh yeah! Actually, come up and
I'll take a picture and send it to her.

00:06:39.207 --> 00:06:45.118
(cheering)

00:06:45.118 --> 00:06:48.668
MATT: Just because watching Laura freak out is
amazing, as you've seen. She's so much fun to mess

00:06:48.668 --> 00:06:55.236
with. Go ahead, take a pose for me! Yay! Thank
you!

00:06:55.236 --> 00:07:05.110
(cheering and applause)

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.837
MATT: That's so cool! So stuff like this happens
now, which is crazy! To put it into context, we

00:07:08.837 --> 00:07:12.987
were already pretty nervous going in because when
we started streaming originally, they were

00:07:12.987 --> 00:07:16.448
characters we had already been with for a few
years privately, so everyone was very sure of

00:07:16.448 --> 00:07:24.986
themselves and their personalities, story arcs, we
just opened it up to the world. This was a new

00:07:24.986 --> 00:07:29.367
campaign. Everyone keep this in mind, too: while
we've been playing this for a number of years, for

00:07:29.367 --> 00:07:35.867
a lot of our party, it was their second campaign
ever because the first arc, Vox Machina was their

00:07:35.867 --> 00:07:39.718
first experience playing a role playing game. They
were super nervous about it!

00:07:39.718 --> 00:07:40.652
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Except for Liam!

00:07:40.652 --> 00:07:52.150
MATT: Except for Liam, Taliesin, me, and Marisha,
everyone-- I'll switch over to this one. We're

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:56.008
sitting down at the table and getting ready to go
live. Everyone's getting jittery and they're

00:07:56.008 --> 00:08:01.880
nervous going, "Oh my god, I hope it's okay!"
Travis goes and checks the numbers. Two minutes

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:11.736
before we go live and he's like, "There's 70,000
people on Twitch." We're like, "What?!" He goes,

00:08:11.736 --> 00:08:22.667
"I think it's broken." Reloads it. "Oh, now it's
80." All of us turn pale. I'm curious to go back

00:08:22.667 --> 00:08:33.804
and watch our faces on the VOD to see how all of
us are just--. "Hi." The total numbers came in

00:08:33.804 --> 00:08:39.817
between the platforms; we were streaming to
Twitch, YouTube Live, and Alpha and I think,

00:08:39.817 --> 00:08:42.977
between them all, we hit 125,000 people watching
live.

00:08:42.977 --> 00:08:49.927
(applause)

00:08:49.927 --> 00:08:56.066
MATT: Watching us play Dungeons & Dragons. As many
of you out there who grew up in the same era I

00:08:56.066 --> 00:09:02.448
did, back when this thing was very taboo, it
wasn't an understood thing, <i>that's crazy!</i> That's

00:09:02.448 --> 00:09:12.029
nuts! It's magical, it's perpetually magical.
We're so appreciative of all of you. Yeah. We

00:09:12.029 --> 00:09:16.149
don't know what's happening. We have no idea.
We're just holding on by the seat of our pants and

00:09:16.149 --> 00:09:20.049
hoping we don't mess it up. Thank you guys for
being so supportive, thank you guys for being so

00:09:20.049 --> 00:09:26.197
awesome and as excited as we are. Then taking this
example of what we're hoping to be an example of

00:09:26.197 --> 00:09:32.342
goodwill and sharing it with everyone else and
being a continuation and an extension of that.

00:09:32.342 --> 00:09:35.440
Seriously, really appreciate it. Give yourselves a
round of applause for that!

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:44.183
(applause)

00:09:44.183 --> 00:09:48.447
MATT: It's been a huge part of my life. I owe a
lot of who I am as a person, I owe a lot of my

00:09:48.725 --> 00:09:54.679
career and my skills, socially, to growing up
playing role playing games. It's a space where you

00:09:54.679 --> 00:09:59.806
can therapeutically work through issues in your
life through a character that's other than you.

00:09:59.806 --> 00:10:05.107
It's a place where you can find empathy for
personalities and people and different walks of

00:10:05.107 --> 00:10:07.612
life and in different situations than those you're
in.

00:10:07.612 --> 00:10:14.047
MATT: It's a place to express frustration and
anger in a safe area sometimes, against monsters

00:10:14.047 --> 00:10:21.168
and terrors and great evil bad beings that can be
a representation of the things in life that have

00:10:21.168 --> 00:10:28.652
you hurting. It becomes a really great place for
you to learn empathy, to learn expression, to

00:10:28.652 --> 00:10:34.196
learn to be open and be sometimes sensitive with
friends through the comforting veil of another

00:10:34.196 --> 00:10:40.397
character. It's allowed me to learn a lot about
myself, how to be a friend, and it's led to many

00:10:40.397 --> 00:10:44.646
of my standing friendships throughout my whole
life. I owe a lot to roleplaying games, D&D

00:10:44.646 --> 00:10:52.479
specifically. That being the case, and having the
chance to do panels like this and meet guys like

00:10:52.479 --> 00:11:02.778
you and hear your stories, that's nutrition to me.
It keeps me alive, it really excites me. Marisha

00:11:02.778 --> 00:11:11.754
can say, it's exhausting in a weird way how
overwhelming the positivity is, and it's

00:11:11.754 --> 00:11:18.798
absolutely wonderful. It's so much bigger than us.
We're a show, we're a group, we're a game group of

00:11:18.798 --> 00:11:25.367
friends, but the community, the Critters, what you
guys put out there, it eclipses anything and

00:11:25.367 --> 00:11:32.198
everything we do. Even if we may be the core of
that community, you guys continue to be what makes

00:11:32.198 --> 00:11:39.917
all this worth it more. Not trying to get too
emotional, it's a lot of reflection, especially

00:11:39.917 --> 00:11:45.986
with last week's first campaign-- conversation.
I've talked a lot at you for the beginning of this

00:11:45.986 --> 00:11:50.807
panel, so I'd love to talk with you and have
questions to ask, ideas and stuff. We have a

00:11:50.807 --> 00:11:55.808
microphone here at the front. If you have
something you want to discuss, bring it up to the

00:11:55.808 --> 00:12:00.668
front here and get in line. Try and keep it
somewhat concise and not too many layered

00:12:00.668 --> 00:12:06.060
questions, because I want to try and talk with as
many of you as possible. We probably won't be able

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:10.533
to get through everybody, but I'm going to try.
And please move at a respectable speed.

00:12:10.533 --> 00:12:12.978
(chuckling)

00:12:12.978 --> 00:12:14.176
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you, Matt!

00:12:14.176 --> 00:12:21.947
MATT: No worries. All right.

00:12:21.947 --> 00:12:25.533
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Matt, what time did your flight
get in on Friday?

00:12:25.533 --> 00:12:34.950
MATT: My flight left at 8am Friday morning. I had
to wake up at 5am and after the nerves, the

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:39.777
jitters of that first campaign on Thursday, I
didn't get to sleep until about 3am. So I got two

00:12:39.777 --> 00:12:44.306
hours of sleep, woke up, went to the airport, got
another hour and a half on the plane, because you

00:12:44.306 --> 00:12:49.721
know, plane, and then went right to my signing
yesterday! I might seem a little frazzled over the

00:12:49.721 --> 00:12:58.558
past 24 hours, I apologize, but there's a good
reason. Yeah, fair enough. Sorry! Hi.

00:12:58.558 --> 00:12:59.749
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi, hello again.

00:12:59.749 --> 00:13:01.168
MATT: Hello again. What's your question?

00:13:01.168 --> 00:13:07.247
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We had similar conversations when
I could get ahold of you about-- with the

00:13:07.247 --> 00:13:11.838
campaigns that I'm currently in, that I was
considering starting to stream them or record them

00:13:11.838 --> 00:13:20.608
or novelize them or something. Because I didn't
get that idea until after the first session, which

00:13:20.608 --> 00:13:27.377
is basically the session zero, where they had who
everyone is, meeting in the tavern, that sort of

00:13:27.377 --> 00:13:35.963
thing. Are you still able to start something akin
to Critical Role, where you record for the games

00:13:35.963 --> 00:13:41.256
even if you miss the very first session, because
the first session has all of the backstory stuff

00:13:41.256 --> 00:13:41.751
so far?

00:13:41.751 --> 00:13:48.156
MATT: Yeah. Most stories, whether it be film,
television, novel, the first chapter isn't you

00:13:48.156 --> 00:13:52.087
learning everything about the characters. There's
a lot of elements of their life that's already

00:13:52.087 --> 00:13:56.526
happened, and part of, for the reader, what's
interesting is to fill those gaps. Like for the

00:13:56.526 --> 00:14:01.796
new campaign, I did a session zero with all the
players before we started streaming it. It was a

00:14:01.796 --> 00:14:06.536
prelude that was both a space for them to feel
comfortable, this is a little private thing that

00:14:06.536 --> 00:14:10.835
they have for themselves to figure out their
character. That way when we come into the session

00:14:10.835 --> 00:14:17.727
that first episode, you already feel like it's a
lived-in world as opposed to everyone awkwardly

00:14:17.727 --> 00:14:24.546
going, "Hi, I'm a tiefling." There's a little bit
of that too, but that happens with any beginning

00:14:24.546 --> 00:14:28.596
of the campaign. Don't feel like you have to
front-load all of the exposition or all of the

00:14:28.596 --> 00:14:32.167
information, all of the backstories up front. If
anything, it makes the world feel more like you're

00:14:32.167 --> 00:14:41.057
getting a glimpse at a living space, if people
continue to act and be without all of the

00:14:41.057 --> 00:14:44.521
information available to you. It's already
happened and it's still happening. Don't feel like

00:14:44.521 --> 00:14:45.978
that should be constraining to you.

00:14:45.978 --> 00:14:51.105
AUDIENCE MEMBER: And also, aside from D&D, which
is the d20 system, do you have any other systems

00:14:51.105 --> 00:14:54.919
you like in terms of tabletop games, and why?

00:14:54.919 --> 00:14:59.926
MATT: This is a whole long discussion, and I'm
trying to keep it concise so we can get to the

00:14:59.926 --> 00:15:05.626
next question. The Fate system I've enjoyed a lot
of times. I've played Traveler and Diaspora, which

00:15:05.626 --> 00:15:12.078
are both fun games, both hard sci-fi and weird
sci-fi. Especially Traveler, because it's one of

00:15:12.078 --> 00:15:17.438
the few games where you can die in character
creation. Because you get to choose your

00:15:17.438 --> 00:15:20.949
character's path in life, what jobs they do, and
if they go into more dangerous jobs, they learn

00:15:20.949 --> 00:15:24.066
better skills to start with, but there's a chance
that if you have a dangerous job, you'll get

00:15:24.066 --> 00:15:29.087
killed on the job and have to start over. It's
kind of fucked. The old school Deadlands system,

00:15:29.087 --> 00:15:33.275
which is phenomenal. It's a little more
complicated. It's not as streamlined as the newer

00:15:33.275 --> 00:15:40.758
one, but the idea that casting spells is you
playing a card game with devils and demons, and

00:15:40.758 --> 00:15:45.736
the better hands you get against the DM or the GM
of the game who's playing the devil's side gets

00:15:45.736 --> 00:15:49.847
you different abilities based on the spell you
want to do. It's got a lot of really cool old

00:15:49.847 --> 00:15:55.137
Western elements. There's also the Amber Diceless
Roleplaying Game when I was in high school based

00:15:55.137 --> 00:15:57.928
off the Amber series, and that was interesting but
that takes a lot of trust because without dice,

00:15:57.928 --> 00:16:02.542
it's a lot of you all deciding together what
succeeds and what fails. That can lead to

00:16:02.542 --> 00:16:07.286
arguments, I learned very quickly, if everyone
isn't on the same page and trusts each other at

00:16:07.286 --> 00:16:11.267
the table. Those are a few examples of what I've
enjoyed. I've heard good things about the newer

00:16:11.267 --> 00:16:18.076
Star Wars systems. Haven't tried that yet. Anyway,
I have to get to the next question, but thank you, man!

00:16:19.556 --> 00:16:23.080
ORGANIZER: Real quick guys, keep it to one
question only. If you have a second question, go

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:25.757
to the end of the line and then ask your second
one.

00:16:25.757 --> 00:16:27.129
MATT: Hello!

00:16:27.129 --> 00:16:34.496
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hello! Oh gosh, that was loud. I
just wanted to say that I really look up to you

00:16:34.496 --> 00:16:42.726
and your storytelling. Your descriptions and stuff
is amazing. I wanted to know-- I'm sorry if this

00:16:42.726 --> 00:16:50.069
has been asked before, but do you have any tips or
advice for anyone, writers or bored GMs,

00:16:50.069 --> 00:16:56.805
storytellers, in how you come up with such great
descriptions and such vivid images of things that

00:16:56.805 --> 00:16:58.086
are all in your head?

00:16:58.086 --> 00:17:04.847
MATT: For one, reading a lot. It helps expand your
vocabulary. There's a lot of words that you'll

00:17:04.847 --> 00:17:07.217
come across in books and be like, "I don't know
what that means." You look it up and be like,

00:17:07.217 --> 00:17:11.516
"That's cool, and now I know that word and I can
use it." That was huge for me growing up and

00:17:11.516 --> 00:17:16.666
continues to be whenever I have time to read. A
cool way to keep that sharp moving forward. Also

00:17:16.871 --> 00:17:21.118
consider when you're setting a scene, it's not
just visuals. Consider all the senses. Consider

00:17:21.118 --> 00:17:24.637
ways that you can set a scene with both what
they're seeing, what the temperature of the room

00:17:24.637 --> 00:17:30.348
is, if there's a certain acrid or iron-like taste
in the air, or if it's very cold and causes their

00:17:30.348 --> 00:17:37.845
teeth to feel pain when they breathe in. Is there
a specific sound of distant shaking, or perhaps

00:17:37.845 --> 00:17:42.555
water dripping off wall condensation? Think of how
the different senses are affected when you set a

00:17:42.555 --> 00:17:49.858
scene, and that helps immerse your players or
whoever's reading your story as you get into it.

00:17:49.858 --> 00:17:54.320
That's a big topic, but from running a game
standpoint, I find those are good little tricks

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:58.118
whenever you open a new sequence, a new location
for the players to immediately pull them into the

00:17:58.118 --> 00:18:03.237
world and help them imagine exactly where they
are. That helps the immersion, it helps the

00:18:03.237 --> 00:18:09.047
players get ready to dive into it in character.
That's a really quick tip that I hope will be helpful.

00:18:09.678 --> 00:18:10.281
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.

00:18:10.281 --> 00:18:11.588
MATT: No worries, thank you.

00:18:11.588 --> 00:18:13.257
AUDIENCE MEMBER: How's it going?

00:18:13.257 --> 00:18:14.487
MATT: Good! How're you doing?

00:18:14.487 --> 00:18:21.049
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Good. In the new campaign when
your players are talking to you about the new characters--

00:18:21.049 --> 00:18:24.267
MATT: Yes, which by the way, I do want try and
avoid spoilers, in case people haven't seen the

00:18:24.267 --> 00:18:25.467
new episode.

00:18:25.467 --> 00:18:29.826
AUDIENCE MEMBER: And they came to you with their
ideas, did any of them come to you with an idea

00:18:29.826 --> 00:18:33.597
that made you go, "Ooh, hmm, no?"

00:18:33.597 --> 00:18:40.944
MATT: Generally, no. Not my players. I've had that
happen in the past. If a player wants to play a

00:18:40.944 --> 00:18:46.693
character of a certain kind, I'm not going to tell
them not to. I might help them finesse it, or let

00:18:47.084 --> 00:18:50.455
them know in some situations where it's going to
be difficult based on the world we're playing in,

00:18:50.455 --> 00:18:56.363
or they don't understand issues that might come
up. For instance, if somebody was like, "I have a

00:18:56.363 --> 00:19:02.364
"charisma of eight. I want to be a warlock!" I'd be
like, "Maybe let's try to mix up those stats a

00:19:02.364 --> 00:19:11.462
"little." There's certain concepts that may not be
the strongest concept. In fact, we have a few race

00:19:11.462 --> 00:19:15.923
and class combinations in the new campaign that
are by no means optimal when you consider

00:19:15.923 --> 00:19:20.208
min-maxing character strengths. But that's also
cool because you get combinations you wouldn't

00:19:20.208 --> 00:19:25.428
expect. To me, it's more important to create a
character idea then it is to create something

00:19:25.428 --> 00:19:30.785
that's optimally powerful. If you can do both and
that's your game, that's fun too. But I don't

00:19:30.785 --> 00:19:37.254
think that should hinder you necessarily. There's
never been a concept that I've shot down. I can

00:19:37.254 --> 00:19:41.391
help players finesse it if they're unsure, or if
they're trying to feel out how this would fit in

00:19:41.391 --> 00:19:44.469
the world, then I'll work with them, and we'll
talk over their story and talk about their

00:19:44.469 --> 00:19:49.287
abilities and how that might fit for their
narrative down the road. It's rare that I shoot

00:19:49.287 --> 00:19:55.264
something down unless the person is a real dick.
"My concept is a person that sets children on

00:19:55.264 --> 00:19:59.773
"fire!" I'm like, "Eh, I don't know if that's going
to play well with the rest of the group, buddy."

00:19:59.773 --> 00:20:00.582
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Lasts one second.

00:20:00.582 --> 00:20:02.124
MATT: Yeah. Thank you.

00:20:04.054 --> 00:20:05.092
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hey, Mercer.

00:20:05.092 --> 00:20:05.579
MATT: Hi!

00:20:05.579 --> 00:20:12.446
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I have a question. What do you
think was the worst decision that Vox Machina ever did?

00:20:14.808 --> 00:20:22.417
MATT: Ooh, personally. That's a <i>lot</i> of
decisions. Let's see.

00:20:22.417 --> 00:20:23.527
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Goldfish!

00:20:23.527 --> 00:20:37.703
MATT: That's a member of Vox Machina. Vox Machina
as a whole? Oh, man. To be perfectly honest, not

00:20:37.703 --> 00:20:44.236
checking for traps at the tomb of the Raven Queen.
Because that led to a chain of events that led to

00:20:44.236 --> 00:20:47.305
a very sad story.

00:20:47.305 --> 00:20:50.925
AUDIENCE MEMBER: It was really bad.

00:20:50.925 --> 00:20:55.499
MATT: Yeah, but it made for a great narrative. Not
all things have to be positive, there are a lot of

00:20:55.499 --> 00:21:00.881
things to gain. Yeah, there's always and urge as a
GM to be like, "I want this to end up okay. I want

00:21:00.881 --> 00:21:07.777
it to be all right." A lot of times, that's a good
thing, but some stories are powerful because it

00:21:07.777 --> 00:21:11.447
doesn't work out in the most positive light.
That's realistic, and sometimes that's a very

00:21:11.447 --> 00:21:18.446
healing experience to go through that. I know it
was hard for some people in the game to deal with

00:21:18.446 --> 00:21:27.527
eventualities in the narrative and missed
opportunities, to be vague. But overall, I think

00:21:27.527 --> 00:21:33.315
it made for a more impactful story and memorable
one. It's an example of sometimes, you have to let

00:21:33.315 --> 00:21:38.674
the narrative guide where it's going as opposed to
try and shoehorn a happy ending. Unless your

00:21:38.674 --> 00:21:42.656
players are all in a really bad place in the world
and you're like, "Uh, and everything's okay!"

00:21:42.656 --> 00:21:45.507
Because at the same time, you want your players to
have a good time.

00:21:45.507 --> 00:21:46.497
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.

00:21:46.497 --> 00:21:47.187
MATT: Thank you.

00:21:47.187 --> 00:22:00.471
AUDIENCE MEMBER: That's not happening. Sorry. Hi,
I am asking you for advice for both my daughter

00:22:00.471 --> 00:22:08.386
and I as a player and gamemaster. When you get two
people in your group who all of a sudden start--

00:22:08.386 --> 00:22:14.636
they're 40 years old, but they start acting like
13-year-old middle school boys on crack-- and it's

00:22:14.636 --> 00:22:20.146
all fun and games until they almost get you
killed, or as in my daughter's case, her character

00:22:20.146 --> 00:22:24.787
killed on stupid side things. How do you rein that
back in? You don't want to be a killjoy and say,

00:22:24.787 --> 00:22:29.105
"Okay, no fun, no jokes," but how do you rein it
back in so they're focusing on the group as a

00:22:29.105 --> 00:22:31.166
whole and not dying in a bar fight?

00:22:31.166 --> 00:22:38.925
MATT: Couple things. One, if it's really hampering
the narrative and it's preventing a lot of people

00:22:38.925 --> 00:22:43.354
from having a good time, talk with them about it
outside of the game. After a session where it gets

00:22:43.354 --> 00:22:47.487
particularly bad, you can be like, "Hey guys,
before we leave," or, "I'm going to take a moment

00:22:47.487 --> 00:22:52.927
here, I just want to talk," for the sake-- Any
time you're at the table, you try and find a

00:22:52.927 --> 00:22:59.213
balance between being respectful of everyone
else's good time and not trying to derail it

00:22:59.213 --> 00:23:04.148
constantly before other people want to go. For the
most part, a lot of times, because it is a very

00:23:04.148 --> 00:23:08.681
free environment, people will want to be impulsive
and, "I'm going to do what I want!" That's fine to

00:23:08.681 --> 00:23:13.845
a certain extent, but you do have to be respectful
of everyone else at the table. Otherwise, you

00:23:13.845 --> 00:23:17.007
probably won't be invited back to the table.
You're supposed to play the game as a

00:23:17.007 --> 00:23:20.299
collaborative experience. Even though there can be
tension, there can be moments where there can be

00:23:20.299 --> 00:23:25.248
conflict inside. People can be selfish if it's in
character, but if it's so much to the point where

00:23:25.248 --> 00:23:28.466
nobody else is having fun and that's a problem
with the way you're playing the game, maybe this

00:23:28.466 --> 00:23:32.505
table isn't where you should be playing. There are
tables that that might work at. There might be a

00:23:32.505 --> 00:23:37.436
bunch of powergamers who are down with the idea of
being crazy and weird. I've had those games too

00:23:37.436 --> 00:23:40.790
and they're fun, but you have to make sure
everybody's on the same page. Talk with them about

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:48.195
it, and if they continue to do it, or you want to
teach them a lesson, sometimes make those choices

00:23:48.195 --> 00:23:52.936
lead to a very bad-- not TPK scenario, but if
they're getting in serious bar fights all the

00:23:52.936 --> 00:23:57.018
time, they're going to get arrested. They're going
to get imprisoned. They're going to get

00:23:57.018 --> 00:24:00.884
interrogated. They're going to get branded as a
criminal on the shoulder. Whoever the head of the

00:24:00.884 --> 00:24:06.066
guard there is going to take a personal liking to
make sure that he makes their life miserable. Now

00:24:06.066 --> 00:24:11.008
they're a watched individual. Every town they go
into, everyone seeing their face grimaces. Now

00:24:11.008 --> 00:24:16.656
it's a, "Oh my god, there's consequences to your
actions!" That's a way to do it too, where you

00:24:16.656 --> 00:24:18.436
don't have to kill the character, but you can
certainly shame them!

00:24:18.436 --> 00:24:21.538
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I like that, thank you!

00:24:21.538 --> 00:24:22.699
MATT: Yeah, shame!

00:24:22.699 --> 00:24:26.815
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hey, Matt, nice to see you
again.

00:24:26.815 --> 00:24:28.044
MATT: Hey buddy, good to see you.

00:24:28.044 --> 00:24:32.651
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I work at the local children's
hospital, and I want to, at some point in the

00:24:32.839 --> 00:24:39.812
future, introduce Dungeons & Dragons to the
children there. But all I've ever done as a DM is

00:24:39.812 --> 00:24:47.386
DM for adults. Do you have any advice for DMing
for children and how young they should be before

00:24:47.386 --> 00:24:53.960
they get into it? Also, is it at all possible to
see how Victor the black powder merchant is doing?

00:24:53.960 --> 00:25:01.179
(laughter and cheering)

00:25:01.179 --> 00:25:06.900
MATT: First part, I'm going to relay what I've
heard from other people. I've run a few games for

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:11.111
kids. Liam has a lot more experience with this.
Sam recently did it. Patrick Rothfuss runs it for

00:25:11.111 --> 00:25:18.697
his son. One, the best thing you can do is keep
the math minimal so you can focus on the

00:25:18.697 --> 00:25:24.184
narrative. If you're teaching kids math, that's a
different thing, but make it so it's more of a

00:25:24.184 --> 00:25:28.710
storytelling thing. The dice roll, maybe a
modifier here and there, but however way you can

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:33.439
simplify the rules. I'm sure there's people online
who have more reduced home rule versions of D&D

00:25:33.439 --> 00:25:38.748
for kids if you research enough. I've seen a few
out there; it's pretty cool. Second, steer away

00:25:38.748 --> 00:25:44.351
from focusing on the violent combat aspects of it,
and focus more on the problem solving, like

00:25:44.351 --> 00:25:49.294
communal problem solving. One thing that Patrick
Rothfuss does for really young kids, I find, is

00:25:49.294 --> 00:25:54.551
not give them a weapon. Give them some magical
items and some tools, and it challenges so they

00:25:54.551 --> 00:25:58.313
have to think of creative ways to get out of it.
He gave his son no weapons, but gave him a rope

00:25:58.313 --> 00:26:04.105
that ties itself, and then put him in a dungeon
area where all he had was his rope. He ended up

00:26:04.105 --> 00:26:07.409
using it to tie up monsters, maybe ask them
questions and eventually convince him to help him

00:26:07.409 --> 00:26:11.570
out. Then throw the rope up to climb areas where
it was dangerous or use it to wrap around things

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:16.613
he could swing across. Let them become creative
and problem solve without always having to kill

00:26:16.613 --> 00:26:21.928
things. As adults, we can keep a difference, but
you're not going to teach a bunch of kids that

00:26:21.928 --> 00:26:27.201
"Sometimes the best thing to do is slaughter your
opponent." That's maybe not the best thing to

00:26:27.201 --> 00:26:33.058
teach them. Gauge the group to see if they want
high adventure or if they want dark. Liam was

00:26:33.058 --> 00:26:36.850
surprised when his daughter and all of her female
friends wanted to play, and he's like, "What do

00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:44.139
"you want to play?" and they all went, "Curse of
Strahd!" and he was like, "Okay." The more he ran

00:26:44.139 --> 00:26:49.480
it, the more that they were craving some good,
scary horror, and so he felt it out. You feel out

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:53.220
the group at first. You play it soft and see what
they're interested in and then gear it more

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:57.575
towards their style, but simplify it, focus on the
story and narrative. Problem solving and

00:26:57.575 --> 00:27:02.416
challenges I think are generally more interesting
than always having combat, although combat can be

00:27:02.416 --> 00:27:07.300
fun depending on how old the group is, and be
conscientious about it. Those are a few. The

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:12.490
opposite side, I don't want to confirm anything
because I like to see anybody else's

00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:16.010
interpretation. My personal mind-- and I'm not
saying this is canon, because I don't want to kill

00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:19.931
anybody else's idea-- I like to imagine in that
final battle, one of the loud explosions that you

00:27:19.931 --> 00:27:26.811
heard in Vasselheim was him lining the entirety of
his shop, all of his explosives with a torch in

00:27:26.811 --> 00:27:33.958
his hand, (as Victor) "They'll never take me
alive!" and a bunch of cultists come in right for

00:27:33.958 --> 00:27:39.349
him, and in that final moment as he lures them all
in, he took them all out with him. That's how I

00:27:39.349 --> 00:27:40.200
like to imagine it.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:45.990
(applause)

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:52.483
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Matt, when will Elder Scrolls:
Exandria happen, and will Wildemount be DLC for it?

00:27:53.042 --> 00:28:03.740
MATT: I mean, talk to your local Bethesda. That
would be crazy! Pretty cool. I'd love that. Heck

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:11.735
yeah, I'd love that! It's crazy to me that there's
even a book that's out there and it's something I

00:28:11.735 --> 00:28:17.062
made up. That's crazy to me, so that, I can't
even. If I think too hard, I'm going to bleed from

00:28:17.062 --> 00:28:23.669
my nose. Ugh, aneurysm. I hope so! Hello!

00:28:23.669 --> 00:28:30.190
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi! My husband and I both DM, but
I think the thing we struggle with most is having

00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:36.472
memorable characters, and that's something that
you are absolutely well-known for. What is your

00:28:36.472 --> 00:28:42.313
advice on coming up with characters that people
will remember their names four weeks later, that

00:28:42.313 --> 00:28:43.982
kind of a thing?

00:28:43.982 --> 00:28:47.387
MATT: Right. For one thing, depending on how you
create your character, whether it be

00:28:47.642 --> 00:28:52.445
random-rolling for-- Take a low statistic
somewhere interesting in your character, whether

00:28:52.445 --> 00:28:57.106
it be super low strength-- they're super weak and
have a hard time getting around. If you want to be

00:28:57.106 --> 00:29:03.243
real hardcore Dark Souls-level, go a super low
constitution and be super-- One thing about a

00:29:03.243 --> 00:29:08.453
unique character is a serious flaw, or a number of
serious flaws that makes them human. It makes them

00:29:08.453 --> 00:29:13.612
easy to connect with. That doesn't necessarily
have to reflect in their statistics, but in the

00:29:13.612 --> 00:29:18.924
5th Edition rules, they do a good job of
introducing players to bonds and flaws and

00:29:18.924 --> 00:29:25.535
personality traits, and it's a really good
introduction to that. Play up the character you

00:29:25.535 --> 00:29:30.853
create. What are their long-term goals? I think is
an important thing so they know at least what

00:29:30.853 --> 00:29:35.132
they're eventually driving towards. What's their
short-term goal, what is it they're trying to

00:29:35.132 --> 00:29:41.024
accomplish right now, and the use of having this
other party. How are they intending to make this

00:29:41.024 --> 00:29:48.132
group of new friends help them get to that goal?
Consider the things that they really don't like

00:29:48.132 --> 00:29:53.989
and try to avoid. Is it confrontation with family?
Is it a specific type of creature that they had a

00:29:53.989 --> 00:29:58.076
bad experience with, that they're always looking
over their shoulder for, like a bogeyman-type of

00:29:58.076 --> 00:30:04.112
thing? Is it they have a fear of public speaking?
Is it an issue with law enforcement? They're like,

00:30:04.112 --> 00:30:08.091
"I've dealt with the man!" which will always get
them in trouble, which is fun, too. Find certain

00:30:08.091 --> 00:30:13.062
things that you can write down and stick to that
may get your party in trouble. Because, honestly,

00:30:13.062 --> 00:30:19.673
some of the best experiences are getting your
party in trouble. Try and find common ground

00:30:19.673 --> 00:30:24.182
between the characters. Conflict is good and
that's why a lot of my campaigns, I'll talk to the

00:30:24.182 --> 00:30:29.222
players and ask them: If any of you have previous
relationships, what are they? As opposed to having

00:30:29.222 --> 00:30:32.992
the awkward we all meet at a table and don't know
each other and introduce ourselves like an AA

00:30:32.992 --> 00:30:38.496
meeting, and now we're fighting, adventuring! I
find if you have a little bit of back history that

00:30:38.496 --> 00:30:43.272
you develop together, you already come in feeling
stronger connection with those characters, and

00:30:43.272 --> 00:30:47.733
that strong connection between the two of you has
the other players wanting to engage more with that

00:30:47.733 --> 00:30:55.971
because they want, "Oh, I want that!" There's no
real trick to it, more consider the whole spectrum

00:30:55.971 --> 00:31:02.084
of good things about them, bad things about them,
wants, goals, fears, and write them down. It won't

00:31:02.084 --> 00:31:08.766
be perfect at first. It's a messy process,
figuring out your character. To be fair, all of us

00:31:08.766 --> 00:31:12.394
at the end of the first episode of the new
campaign, we're like, "Okay then! That was better

00:31:12.394 --> 00:31:16.914
"than expected." We were all waiting for it to fall
apart, and even then after, we're getting phone

00:31:16.914 --> 00:31:24.404
calls from the players like, "Okay. I think I'm
getting an idea now." So it's a process. Those

00:31:24.404 --> 00:31:26.659
hopefully might help a little bit. Could be a long
topic.

00:31:26.659 --> 00:31:27.752
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah, thank you!

00:31:27.752 --> 00:31:28.538
MATT: No worries.

00:31:30.038 --> 00:31:33.669
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi, Matt. I'm a newer fan, and
I'm new to tabletop games.

00:31:33.672 --> 00:31:34.620
MATT: Welcome!

00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:36.857
AUDIENCE MEMBER: And I notice that you recognize
this exceptional cosplay.

00:31:36.857 --> 00:31:37.288
MATT: Yes!

00:31:37.288 --> 00:31:41.061
AUDIENCE MEMBER: There's several cosplays in the
room, and this being the Critical Role panel, if

00:31:41.061 --> 00:31:44.968
possible, before the end of the panel, could we
get everybody get a photo with you so we have all

00:31:44.968 --> 00:31:46.009
the cosplays together?

00:31:46.009 --> 00:31:47.928
MATT: I think that's a glorious plan.

00:31:47.928 --> 00:31:48.590
AUDIENCE MEMBER: All right, thank you.

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:50.059
MATT: (Gilmore voice) <i>Glorious</i> plan.

00:31:50.059 --> 00:31:54.648
(applause)

00:31:54.648 --> 00:31:57.640
MATT: We'll get the cosplayers up at the end of
the panel for one group photo at the front of the

00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:58.991
audience. Awesome.

00:31:58.991 --> 00:32:00.187
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi, Matt!

00:32:00.187 --> 00:32:00.957
MATT: Hey, buddy!

00:32:00.957 --> 00:32:08.788
AUDIENCE MEMBER: As a DM, I've thrown my fair
share of challenges at my players, like the time I

00:32:08.788 --> 00:32:13.634
threw a dragon turtle at you all, and you turned
it into a tortoise.

00:32:13.634 --> 00:32:15.970
MATT: That's adorable!

00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:25.909
AUDIENCE MEMBER: It still upsets me. Anyways, I
love doing that. I love challenging my players in

00:32:25.909 --> 00:32:31.471
fun, creative ways like that, but at times, it
does feel like it's an arms race at times, because

00:32:31.471 --> 00:32:39.170
they really like to murder things! What advice
would you have for a DM that's struggling to

00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:45.139
challenge the players and have them develop
personalities and adventures like your characters,

00:32:45.139 --> 00:32:46.888
that go on for years and years?

00:32:46.888 --> 00:32:52.460
MATT: For one thing, it <i>is</i> an arms race in a
weird way, because it's you trying to outsmart

00:32:52.460 --> 00:33:00.650
multiple other people as a dungeon master. That's
supervillain territory. That's you going, "These

00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:04.557
"are my peers that I respect and love, and we're
all on a very equal playing field as far as

00:33:04.557 --> 00:33:05.188
"intellect goes--"

00:33:05.188 --> 00:33:06.427
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Let's murder them!

00:33:06.427 --> 00:33:11.995
MATT: Yeah. And they're all trying to beat my
stuff! For one thing, it's fun when you have a

00:33:12.298 --> 00:33:16.070
group that are all, "We can do a lot of damage!",
you're like, "Oh, that's cool. That doesn't help

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:20.950
if you fight a lot of creatures that you can't
damage." You can only defeat them by discovering

00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:25.993
these three relics throughout this area and
destroy them at this one pillar, but while that's

00:33:25.993 --> 00:33:31.470
happening, it's stalking them the entire time. The
fear of "We cannot touch this thing." Coming up

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:38.380
with challenges where the creature can only be
damaged if you acquire this one NPC and have them

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:42.566
within a proximity of it because their backstories
are tied, but you have to keep them alive as much

00:33:42.566 --> 00:33:47.009
as you're also getting ready to damage this thing.
Coming up with abilities that the creatures can

00:33:47.009 --> 00:33:52.769
have that can shut down or convert party members
to its side. Nothing's better than sinking your

00:33:52.769 --> 00:33:57.950
party against itself, by the way. It's a
delightful thing. In fact, it's really frustrating

00:33:57.950 --> 00:34:04.511
when Grog's berserk ability allows him to ignore
charm effects. I was like, "Ugh! Oh man, it could

00:34:04.511 --> 00:34:11.835
"be so much fun! Just want to tear him apart from
the inside." You have to think outside of the box,

00:34:11.835 --> 00:34:15.575
and remember, even the creatures in the Player's
Handbook, if you're like, "This creature, I've put

00:34:15.575 --> 00:34:19.590
"up against them before, or something similar to
it, and they stomped it." You look at it and go,

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:23.450
"Well, they stomped it because they have a lot of
damage output, this creature, they resist a lot of

00:34:23.450 --> 00:34:28.339
"the abilities that it can put on them or
conditions." Nothing's stopping you from

00:34:28.339 --> 00:34:31.274
customizing it. Nothing's stopping you from
changing it. Which is great, too, if you have a

00:34:31.274 --> 00:34:34.790
group of players that have been playing for a long
time and they already know what creatures can do.

00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:39.290
Nothing's better than having them fight something
like, "Don't worry guys, it's resistant to fire!"

00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:45.049
Or it's vulnerable to fire, and they do Fireball,
and it's all of a sudden immune. They're like,

00:34:45.049 --> 00:34:50.586
"Wait, what?" because suddenly they don't know
where they are. They don't know what's going on.

00:34:50.586 --> 00:34:58.506
The real fear creeps into their eyes. Don't be
afraid to customize monsters. Consider encounters

00:34:58.506 --> 00:35:04.964
that sometimes cannot be won by sheer damage
output. Sometimes rely on conditions as a

00:35:04.964 --> 00:35:09.899
difficulty factor. If a creature has a radial
stun, that's going to mess things up real fast.

00:35:09.899 --> 00:35:14.730
Especially if it's on a five- or six-regeneration
thing. Every few rounds or so, all of a sudden,

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:18.579
half of the party is stunned. That sucks. For
them.

00:35:18.579 --> 00:35:21.501
(laughter)

00:35:21.501 --> 00:35:22.869
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you very much, Matt. I
appreciate it.

00:35:22.869 --> 00:35:29.680
MATT: No worries. I'm sorry about your party, by
the way.

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:33.279
AUDIENCE MEMBER: It's okay. I live with them.

00:35:33.279 --> 00:35:34.340
MATT: Hi!

00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:41.477
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi! Love your show. Not really a
D&D question, more about you and your team. You

00:35:41.652 --> 00:35:44.003
and Travis and everyone did an escape room
together.

00:35:44.003 --> 00:35:44.627
MATT: Oh yeah!

00:35:44.627 --> 00:35:49.432
AUDIENCE MEMBER: That was awesome, but I want to
know, how did you get into that? How'd that happen?

00:35:49.432 --> 00:35:56.263
MATT: We've been a fan of escape rooms anyway, me
and Marisha. We've done a few of them. They were

00:35:56.263 --> 00:36:00.022
doing a show for Alpha at the time called "Escape"
where they were asking people to do different

00:36:00.022 --> 00:36:04.225
escape rooms, and they had one that was a Harry
Potter sorcery theme. They were like, "Well, get

00:36:04.225 --> 00:36:11.480
"the Critical Role people," and we were like,
"Yeah!" Chris Sabat, voice of Vegeta, was in town

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:14.492
and they're like, "Well, get him in!" He's like,
"I don't know what I'm doing," and we're like,

00:36:14.492 --> 00:36:23.494
"Great!" It was a fun escape room they invited us
to do, and we totally almost got there and lost at

00:36:23.494 --> 00:36:29.283
the very last second, which was frustrating. That
was them asking us to do it from an internal Geek

00:36:29.283 --> 00:36:34.382
& Sundry standpoint, but they knew we were fans of
escape rooms. My proposal to Marisha, actually,

00:36:34.382 --> 00:36:41.712
was I designed and built an escape room that was
Lovecraft-themed. We were all sneaking, me and

00:36:41.712 --> 00:36:46.296
Taliesin and a bunch of a friends were sneaking
off for days at a time. "I had to record, I had

00:36:46.296 --> 00:36:49.211
"sessions back-to-back these days. Well, see you
this evening!" Then we'd drive down to Huntington

00:36:49.211 --> 00:36:53.448
Beach. This friend of ours had a warehouse, and
we're building flats and getting old furniture and

00:36:53.448 --> 00:36:59.386
made an escape room for her. Escape rooms are a
thing we're fans of, but I think I've built the

00:36:59.386 --> 00:37:02.161
only one I'll ever build, because they're a pain
in the butt!

00:37:02.161 --> 00:37:03.625
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.

00:37:03.625 --> 00:37:04.511
MATT: Thank you.

00:37:06.991 --> 00:37:07.982
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi, Matt.

00:37:07.982 --> 00:37:08.627
MATT: Hello!

00:37:08.627 --> 00:37:12.872
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I have a question about-- I don't
want to be too spoiler-y, but toward the end of

00:37:12.872 --> 00:37:19.283
the last campaign, talking about missed
opportunities. That was one of the more visceral,

00:37:19.283 --> 00:37:22.374
emotional moments that I've seen in almost
anything.

00:37:22.374 --> 00:37:23.434
MATT: I know what you're talking about.

00:37:25.994 --> 00:37:31.470
AUDIENCE MEMBER: What's going through your head
both as the DM and as Matt, his friend, when

00:37:31.501 --> 00:37:40.569
you're seeing a player go through that kind of
emotional reaction, both as him and as his character?

00:37:40.569 --> 00:37:49.111
MATT: Part of that is checking in with the player.
The player involved-- we had many discussions

00:37:49.111 --> 00:37:55.520
outside of the game about the possible paths the
character might take. It was very much a, one,

00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:59.380
where do you see the character wanting to go? What
are the decisions he'd make based on certain

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:05.864
scenarios, and are you comfortable with pursuing
this regardless of how it turns out? Making sure

00:38:05.864 --> 00:38:09.332
that the player was okay with that because, once
again, you want to make sure they're having a good

00:38:09.332 --> 00:38:14.440
time, and you don't want to, for the sake of,
"Well, the dice said," completely destroy somebody

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:19.311
who's going through a hard time in their life. You
have to be conscientious of that. Check in with

00:38:19.311 --> 00:38:22.483
them, make sure everything's okay, make sure
they're okay with going along with whatever

00:38:22.483 --> 00:38:27.670
happens. If they say no, then you can be like,
"Okay, well, maybe we'll take a break from this

00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:33.696
"scenario for a little while and come back to it
until you're ready." Or if it's a real scenario,

00:38:33.696 --> 00:38:39.602
you can salvage it and-- So a part of you is the
dungeon master. You have to be true to the

00:38:39.602 --> 00:38:45.121
narrative, but you also have to be respectful of
your players there and make sure that they're

00:38:45.121 --> 00:38:48.021
still having a good time and you're not putting
them in a place that isn't at the time mentally

00:38:48.021 --> 00:38:53.970
healthy for them. It's a hard balance, but it's
one that only comes with experience, and making

00:38:53.970 --> 00:38:58.766
sure that you still respect the people that are
giving you the time to be part of your story.

00:38:58.766 --> 00:39:00.021
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.

00:39:00.021 --> 00:39:01.139
MATT: Thank you.

00:39:03.963 --> 00:39:07.338
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Good to know that locking people
in a room until they accept a proposal is a good idea.

00:39:07.338 --> 00:39:10.281
(laughter)

00:39:10.281 --> 00:39:12.847
MATT: Works in a lot of scenarios, I find!

00:39:12.847 --> 00:39:20.431
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I've never DMed anything before,
and I'm trying to set up a low-magic 5E campaign,

00:39:20.431 --> 00:39:27.791
so that completely eliminates a lot of classes.
How do I go about fixing any of this?

00:39:27.791 --> 00:39:33.564
MATT: You can have a low-magic campaign and have
magic characters. Just consider that they

00:39:33.564 --> 00:39:40.734
understand that having magical abilities is
probably very rare and probably very feared. If

00:39:40.734 --> 00:39:44.207
it's a world where there's almost no magic and
somebody suddenly throws a Fireball, anybody in

00:39:44.207 --> 00:39:51.849
the vicinity's going to be like, "Chain them up.
That's a problem." Consider it can be a very

00:39:51.849 --> 00:39:55.134
fugitive-type game where they're trying to keep
their abilities on the DL. They're trying to hide

00:39:55.134 --> 00:40:00.090
it from society. You can also consider maybe magic
itself is visceral and dangerous. You can have an

00:40:00.090 --> 00:40:04.206
element where if they roll really low on an
attack, like wild magic-wise, and whenever they

00:40:04.206 --> 00:40:08.431
cast a spell, roll, and if it goes really badly,
they lose control and it might hurt them. You can

00:40:08.431 --> 00:40:12.002
think of narrative reasons as to why magic is
still a dangerous and sparing thing.

00:40:12.002 --> 00:40:13.171
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Oh, like a Spellplague.

00:40:13.171 --> 00:40:17.979
MATT: That can work out, yeah! Are we talking
spell plague, like Warcraft? Like Plague?

00:40:17.979 --> 00:40:19.111
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Forgotten Realms.

00:40:19.111 --> 00:40:23.068
MATT: Okay, there we go. Yes, that can work well.
Oh, Blood Plague is what I was thinking of. Old

00:40:23.068 --> 00:40:32.699
WoW players know what I'm talking about. They were
watching the desolation of Ironforge. You can

00:40:32.699 --> 00:40:38.009
tailor classes if you want to. You can tell
people-- if you really want no players to be

00:40:38.009 --> 00:40:44.858
casters, you can have them multiclass down the
road if magic becomes more prevalent, if they'd be

00:40:44.858 --> 00:40:50.548
interested. Or you can reduce the overall damage
of spells if you're keeping combat more tailored,

00:40:50.548 --> 00:40:54.424
but that gets a little more fiddly with the
customization, and if this is your first time

00:40:54.424 --> 00:40:57.091
DMing, I wouldn't recommend messing with it that
much.

00:40:57.091 --> 00:40:59.276
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah, I already created two
classes for it.

00:40:59.276 --> 00:41:01.570
MATT: Okay, so you're already down the path!

00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:03.370
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I needed a healing class.

00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:08.770
MATT: Fair enough. But then you consider healing--
some abilities may not be spells, they can be

00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:14.320
variations to it. For instance, maybe they're an
alchemist. Maybe a Fireball is a giant sphere of

00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:17.571
some concoction they made and they throw it and it
explodes and has the same damage and the same

00:41:17.571 --> 00:41:22.121
radius, but it's not necessarily magical. Or a
healing spell can be somebody who is a fantastic

00:41:22.121 --> 00:41:26.130
field medic and has a bunch of salves and
medicinal herbs that they can jam into their

00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:31.399
wounds real fast, and it's a Cure Wounds spell.
You can find ways to tailor existing rules, take

00:41:31.399 --> 00:41:36.290
away the narrative magic aspect of it to a certain
extent-- it might be a little unwieldy. In the

00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:45.661
higher levels-- Ice Storm! Turn the AC on very
high! By then, maybe there's other ways you can

00:41:45.661 --> 00:41:50.080
narratively consider the use of magic in the
world, but those are some ways you can go about

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:51.271
it. I hope that's helpful.

00:41:55.961 --> 00:41:59.723
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You already addressed my first
question earlier in the day, so I guess my

00:41:59.723 --> 00:42:05.765
question is, early on in the first campaign, you
said, "Make a bear pun, an angel loses its wings."

00:42:05.765 --> 00:42:08.297
How can you look at yourself in the mirror after
Honey Heist?

00:42:08.297 --> 00:42:16.673
(laughter)

00:42:16.673 --> 00:42:25.680
MATT: Look. My wife ran that game. Many of you in
the audience will understand they had no choice.

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:31.171
She was amazing! It was her first time ever
running an RPG! And Honey Heist is a game designed

00:42:31.171 --> 00:42:35.189
for bear puns. There's a difference between too
many bear puns in a game that isn't Honey Heist

00:42:35.189 --> 00:42:39.723
and being in a Honey Heist where it's practically
in the rule set. I didn't feel too bad about that,

00:42:39.723 --> 00:42:41.318
we knew what we were getting into with that.

00:42:41.318 --> 00:42:46.221
AUDIENCE MEMBER: She did an amazing job and in all
seriousness, I think I can speak for everybody in

00:42:46.221 --> 00:42:51.460
this room when I say how important you and your
players are to our week, every single week.

00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:59.734
(applause)

00:42:59.734 --> 00:43:04.971
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hey. First of all, I want to say
I really appreciate you and all of you guys being

00:43:05.132 --> 00:43:09.210
sensitive about spoilers, because I haven't gotten
that far into Critical Role.

00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:10.692
MATT: That's why I was being careful.

00:43:10.692 --> 00:43:19.041
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah. Second thing is a question,
and it is, as a DM and also as a player, how do

00:43:19.041 --> 00:43:26.301
you balance planning with your character sheet and
stuff, or DM obviously, versus improv and

00:43:26.301 --> 00:43:28.691
off-the-cuff stuff? Just think of it when you're
there?

00:43:28.691 --> 00:43:36.571
MATT: That can change either way, often. Part of
what's the thrill of the game is preparation

00:43:36.571 --> 00:43:41.321
usually gets thrown out the window as a dungeon
master when the players make contact with your

00:43:41.321 --> 00:43:46.821
plans. People always say a plan never survives
contact with the enemy. Same deal when it comes to

00:43:46.821 --> 00:43:54.017
running a roleplaying game. The balance for me
preparation-wise is not to prepare too much super

00:43:54.017 --> 00:43:58.002
detailed. Because more often than not, you will
end up throwing out the hours of work that you did

00:43:58.002 --> 00:44:02.071
for this whole thing that never happened, the
party completely missed. Instead, spend a little

00:44:02.071 --> 00:44:07.899
bit of time with bullet points and basic notes
that can give you the general idea of a direction

00:44:07.899 --> 00:44:12.810
it can go or a location they can be at. That way
if it doesn't go to, you didn't lose too much time

00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:16.315
with it, you can always bring it back later. If
they go to it, you have enough written down that

00:44:16.315 --> 00:44:22.969
you can quickly make up the rest, fill in the
gaps, and hope that process allows you to loosely

00:44:22.969 --> 00:44:29.224
prepare a lot more possibilities and as such, be
more comfortable. As a player, I mean, your job is

00:44:29.224 --> 00:44:33.652
to mess with the dungeon master. Your character
sheet is your preparation, and then you come to

00:44:33.652 --> 00:44:38.909
the table and you see how you can fiddle and ruin
their work. (sighing)

00:44:38.909 --> 00:44:44.421
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I guess then all of the pile of
maps you had is not strictly necessarily.

00:44:44.421 --> 00:44:48.524
MATT: Yeah, I know. There's a lot of maps that
never get seen. But at the same time, I would

00:44:48.694 --> 00:44:53.444
prefer-- those are all map ideas that I take a
picture of or save in case they come up later in

00:44:53.444 --> 00:44:58.446
the campaign or the ideas can be reused, so they
don't all go to waste. And I would prefer to

00:44:58.446 --> 00:45:03.687
prepare things just in case and have them go away
then railroad my players to go, "I worked so hard

00:45:03.687 --> 00:45:10.914
"on this map, you're going to fight here, dang it!"
It comes with the territory, I suppose. Thank you.

00:45:13.414 --> 00:45:18.734
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Mr. Mercer, first off, thank you
for streaming. I've never been to a con, I've

00:45:18.734 --> 00:45:20.093
never played Dungeons & Dragons.

00:45:20.093 --> 00:45:20.872
MATT: Oh, welcome!

00:45:20.872 --> 00:45:29.425
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I feel like a fangirl. (laughter)
It's not me! So, I was always curious. When I got

00:45:29.425 --> 00:45:36.162
hooked in the first campaign, it was right around
the time when Percy died. I happened to be on

00:45:36.162 --> 00:45:43.938
Twitch, I was watching it. Yeah, spoilers, sorry
guys. Now everybody's mad. But that night Marisha

00:45:43.938 --> 00:45:50.373
seemed distraught and pissed, and I was always
curious what happened after the stream was over.

00:45:50.373 --> 00:45:55.803
MATT: Whenever anything intense happens in the
stream, people always make jokes like, "Oh, Matt's

00:45:55.803 --> 00:45:57.292
"sleeping on the couch tonight!"

00:45:57.292 --> 00:45:59.844
(laughter)

00:45:59.844 --> 00:46:04.760
MATT: No, it might be all of us afterward going
and getting a drink if something really emotional

00:46:04.947 --> 00:46:08.491
happens. That happens almost every time something
really big happens. We'll all go to Timmy Nolan's,

00:46:08.491 --> 00:46:12.940
which is this little Irish pub in Burbank, not too
far from us. We'll all just have a drink, (long

00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:18.140
groan), commiserate, but there's never any anger
or frustration outside that. A lot of times it's

00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:23.438
in-character, and sometimes it's just frustration
with the scenario, but we all respect each other

00:46:23.438 --> 00:46:27.437
too much to direct it at each other. We're lucky
enough that we have a long-term friendship, and

00:46:27.437 --> 00:46:30.557
we've played long enough where we don't do that.
That's not always the case at game tables. I've

00:46:30.557 --> 00:46:35.330
been in games where people do allow those emotions
to bleed, to directing it at a person outside of

00:46:35.330 --> 00:46:38.679
the game, and that's unfortunate and unhealthy,
but those are things you just talk about

00:46:38.679 --> 00:46:42.159
afterward. If you notice that happening, go to
that player, go to that dungeon master, and be

00:46:42.159 --> 00:46:47.069
like, "Hey, what's up, man? Let's talk this out.
How can we go forward and not let this bother each

00:46:47.069 --> 00:46:52.388
"other again? Understand this isn't me, this is the
character." Those conversations can happen.

00:46:52.388 --> 00:46:58.070
Thankfully, we don't have that problem, because
we've been through enough together and we all

00:46:58.070 --> 00:46:59.829
appreciate and respect each other.

00:46:59.829 --> 00:47:05.389
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Okay. It just seems like after,
you guys mentioned that whenever somebody died,

00:47:05.389 --> 00:47:07.638
you guys all go and get a drink together.

00:47:07.638 --> 00:47:10.814
MATT: Yeah, and we do every time something really
crazy happens.

00:47:10.814 --> 00:47:12.828
AUDIENCE MEMBER: That's a lot of drinks.

00:47:12.828 --> 00:47:15.249
(laughter)

00:47:15.249 --> 00:47:22.959
MATT: Oh man, I'm scared for this new campaign.
They're all level two right now. Oh man! Oh boy!

00:47:22.959 --> 00:47:30.851
It's so funny, they rolled their characters, and
Liam's like, "I have 12 hit points." I'm like, (cackling)

00:47:30.889 --> 00:47:32.139
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Swarm of rats!

00:47:32.139 --> 00:47:37.007
MATT: Oh man, we had our session zero, the first
hit Laura's character took, she went to zero hit

00:47:37.007 --> 00:47:40.751
points, and I was like, "Oh no! Little different
now, isn't it?"

00:47:40.751 --> 00:47:42.583
(laughter)

00:47:42.583 --> 00:47:43.548
AUDIENCE MEMBER: They're basically gods, right?

00:47:43.548 --> 00:47:47.631
MATT: Yeah, basically gods! It's fine, it's great!
I'm sorry.

00:47:47.631 --> 00:47:55.578
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi! So, I've known you of voice
actor fame before I got into Critical Role. Last

00:47:55.788 --> 00:47:57.437
Thursday was actually my first episode.

00:47:57.437 --> 00:47:58.907
MATT: Oh, welcome to the chaos!

00:47:58.907 --> 00:48:02.895
(applause, cheers)

00:48:02.895 --> 00:48:06.361
AUDIENCE MEMBER: So I was wondering if you have
ever been tempted to work in, or have ever

00:48:06.361 --> 00:48:12.894
actually done it before, slipped Easter eggs of
past characters that you've voiced into Critical

00:48:12.894 --> 00:48:13.780
Role or not?

00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:19.841
MATT: I would say I've never tried to slip Easter
eggs outside of the game into it, because I want

00:48:19.841 --> 00:48:24.525
to keep it very separate. The more I bring in pop
culture elements, like the side jokes and stuff,

00:48:24.525 --> 00:48:31.330
the more I think it can break immersion. I want to
keep it wholly of our own realm. But there will be

00:48:31.330 --> 00:48:34.755
character voices that I've used in projects that
will bleed over into it, partially because I like

00:48:34.755 --> 00:48:38.956
to voice a lot of characters! There's going to be
a lot of voices that are similar, and a lot of

00:48:38.956 --> 00:48:42.267
voices you've already heard. That's a little
frustrating. I'll do a character and I'll be like,

00:48:42.267 --> 00:48:49.884
"Yeah, let's have a woodsy kind of farmer type.
I'll do a sort of Southern accent like this." And

00:48:49.884 --> 00:48:56.695
everyone's like, "Oh look, it's Adara from
Pillars!" I'm like, "No, all right." That's going

00:48:56.695 --> 00:48:58.766
to happen, but generally I try to keep it
separate.

00:48:58.766 --> 00:48:59.836
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you so much.

00:48:59.836 --> 00:49:05.476
MATT: Thank you. All right, we've got about ten
minutes left, so I'm going to try to get through

00:49:05.476 --> 00:49:08.256
questions pretty quickly. I'm probably not going
to get through everybody. If I miss you, I'm so

00:49:08.256 --> 00:49:10.434
sorry! We're going to try. Question?

00:49:10.434 --> 00:49:17.476
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hey. I just wanted to ask, after
just finishing the entirety of the first season of

00:49:17.476 --> 00:49:25.376
Critical Role, what's your process for creating
deeper and more memorable characters that stick

00:49:25.376 --> 00:49:26.395
with the players?

00:49:26.395 --> 00:49:37.219
MATT: Honestly, it's hard to force a character to
be beloved by the players. Sometimes, for a lot of

00:49:37.219 --> 00:49:40.476
NPCs, you don't expect them to latch on and they
do. So there's no real--

00:49:40.476 --> 00:49:41.757
CROWD: Gilmore!

00:49:41.757 --> 00:49:46.865
MATT: Gilmore is a perfect example! I never
expected for it to continue that way. But I'm glad

00:49:46.865 --> 00:49:53.195
they did, because he is an amazing character.
There's no way to engineer it, necessarily, but as

00:49:53.195 --> 00:49:57.817
long as you flesh out NPCs that have a similar
dynamic-- as I said earlier about making your

00:49:57.817 --> 00:50:05.570
players more three-dimensional, and having a
series of positive/negative things about them, you

00:50:05.570 --> 00:50:09.706
will comfortably begin to portray them as a
dungeon master in a much more realistic way, and

00:50:09.706 --> 00:50:16.044
that will read better. If you involve the NPC in a
scenario where they either save the party, or

00:50:16.044 --> 00:50:19.756
tremendously help them out of a jam, they're
immediately going to go, "That guy's awesome!

00:50:19.756 --> 00:50:23.609
"We're going to go back to that guy!" or "That lady
saved our butt, and we're going to go ahead and

00:50:23.609 --> 00:50:29.556
"pull her into this next storyline," so that's
really helpful. Or for villains, also. Not every

00:50:29.556 --> 00:50:33.835
villain is black and white. Consider a lot of
enemies or villains don't see themselves as the

00:50:33.835 --> 00:50:37.466
villain. Some of the better ones feel like they're
doing it for the right, and nobody else

00:50:37.466 --> 00:50:42.097
understands or it's selfish reasons, but for them
are, good for me, bad for many other people.

00:50:42.097 --> 00:50:47.836
Thinking about what makes them a three-dimensional
villain makes them a very unique and memorable

00:50:47.836 --> 00:50:52.827
villain. Remember, some of the best villains get
away and come back later! Especially if they're

00:50:52.827 --> 00:50:57.026
intelligent. Not everything stays to die. Not
everything is like, "I'm going to stay until I'm

00:50:57.026 --> 00:51:00.135
"at zero hit points!" (death groans) So they're
like, "I'm at half health. This is not going well.

00:51:00.135 --> 00:51:07.416
"Peace!" (poofs) That's frustrating for the party
too, because then you have the, "I'll get you!"

00:51:07.416 --> 00:51:10.396
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.

00:51:10.396 --> 00:51:11.126
MATT: No worries.

00:51:11.126 --> 00:51:13.384
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Matt, how you doing?

00:51:13.643 --> 00:51:14.453
MATT: Good, how you doing?

00:51:14.453 --> 00:51:18.597
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I'm doing great. Thank you for
being an inspiration to myself and all these

00:51:18.597 --> 00:51:21.764
amazing people I can now call Critters, because
they are fantastic people!

00:51:21.764 --> 00:51:23.384
(cheering)

00:51:23.384 --> 00:51:25.903
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We plan to call every single one
of them brother and sister, because of this

00:51:25.903 --> 00:51:30.017
awesome community. Thank you. I hope that this
continues on for as long as possible.

00:51:30.017 --> 00:51:30.836
MATT: I hope so too.

00:51:30.836 --> 00:51:35.785
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I DM, I run multiple games. My
Thursday is a game, and then straight to Critical

00:51:35.785 --> 00:51:40.015
Role, because it's just all the hype. You
reinvigorate me after maybe a session didn't do

00:51:40.015 --> 00:51:44.604
well, or whatever, but it's just so great. So I'd
rather use up my question to tell you thank you so

00:51:44.604 --> 00:51:46.002
much, and can you bless my dice?

00:51:46.002 --> 00:51:51.890
(cheering, laughter)

00:51:51.890 --> 00:51:56.765
MATT: Thank you very much. Good color scheme.
That's a natural 20 on the first roll.

00:51:56.765 --> 00:52:02.565
(applause, hollering)

00:52:02.565 --> 00:52:08.295
CROWD: Take a picture! Picture!

00:52:08.295 --> 00:52:20.513
MATT: Whoo! I love when the dice work for the
narrative! (laughs) I was waiting for it, like,

00:52:20.513 --> 00:52:21.794
"This is going to be a one, I know it."

00:52:21.794 --> 00:52:30.834
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hey man, so thank you for being
the leader for the tabletop renaissance, you and

00:52:30.834 --> 00:52:36.237
everybody in Critical Role. I was there the very
first day that you guys streamed. The minute you

00:52:36.237 --> 00:52:39.255
guys finished, I knew we'd just changed history
forever.

00:52:39.255 --> 00:52:40.890
MATT: Thank you.

00:52:40.890 --> 00:52:47.213
AUDIENCE MEMBER: And because of the renaissance,
I've now been growing my own blog and everything

00:52:47.213 --> 00:52:50.115
else, and now I'm actually a big part of the D&D
Twitter community.

00:52:50.115 --> 00:52:50.835
MATT: That's great!

00:52:50.835 --> 00:52:56.013
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah. So I'm actually really
everywhere in there now. I also commented about

00:52:56.013 --> 00:52:57.854
your corruption at the tables. (laughs)

00:52:57.854 --> 00:53:00.574
MATT: Glad we finally got to put that out there.

00:53:00.574 --> 00:53:05.065
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I can't believe my Dark Arcana
stuff will need to come out, not like that. I'll

00:53:05.065 --> 00:53:15.155
tag you for that one. But I wanted to ask, because
every DM has their own, what kind of DM prep

00:53:15.155 --> 00:53:16.484
rituals you go through?

00:53:16.484 --> 00:53:27.524
MATT: I have a very specific playlist I listen to
when I'm writing my game. It's a soundtrack that

00:53:27.524 --> 00:53:38.183
is a symphonic version of the Chrono Trigger
soundtrack, mixed with symphonic Final Fantasy VI

00:53:38.183 --> 00:53:46.826
soundtrack. Those games played such a role in my
youth, in my formative creative years, that just

00:53:46.826 --> 00:53:53.345
having those running puts me in the mood to write.
So I'll put that on, the music. I've also found

00:53:53.345 --> 00:53:56.980
that Minecraft soundtrack that is now on Spotify
is actually really good writing music too! It's

00:53:56.980 --> 00:54:04.124
just nice and atmospheric in the background. Other
than that, rituals involve making sure that my

00:54:04.124 --> 00:54:07.744
place is set. I know exactly where everything is
behind my DM screen, I have my dice box here with

00:54:07.744 --> 00:54:12.424
the dice in there, I have my folder here, I have
the preparation sheets of the session here, I have

00:54:12.424 --> 00:54:17.193
maps to the side, I have platforms over here, I
have a drink here, I have a music setup here, I

00:54:17.193 --> 00:54:21.516
have an actual specific layout, that to me the
ritual is placing everything in place before the

00:54:21.516 --> 00:54:27.716
game. And if I'm running late, I don't have time,
I'm gonna <i>flip out</i>, and nobody can talk to me!

00:54:27.716 --> 00:54:33.667
Like, "Hey Matt, can I just like--" (roars) "<i>No!</i>
Setting it up!" I'm scared how I am at those

00:54:33.667 --> 00:54:37.803
times, in hindsight. So the setup ritual is, for
me, definitely a ritual.

00:54:37.803 --> 00:54:42.973
AUDIENCE MEMBER: One last thing. I couldn't make
it to the line in time, could I roll a persuasion

00:54:42.973 --> 00:54:46.535
check to just get a quick signature?

00:54:46.535 --> 00:54:50.463
MATT: Unfortunately, if I do it to one, it opens
up to chaos here, and they have to rush me out

00:54:50.463 --> 00:54:51.835
here thereafter. Are you going to be here
tomorrow?

00:54:51.835 --> 00:54:55.454
AUDIENCE MEMBER: No, I won't. I have to fly.
After?

00:54:55.454 --> 00:55:01.183
MATT: Well, I'll see what I can do. It's a
slippery slope. A lot of people are also in a

00:55:01.333 --> 00:55:04.552
similar situation. I want to do as much as I can,
but it gets to a certain point to where it's unwieldy.

00:55:04.552 --> 00:55:05.173
AUDIENCE MEMBER: But thanks!

00:55:05.173 --> 00:55:05.975
MATT: Thank you, buddy.

00:55:05.975 --> 00:55:07.234
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hey, Matt.

00:55:07.234 --> 00:55:07.853
MATT: Hey, buddy!

00:55:07.853 --> 00:55:12.804
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Actually, my first question is,
how do you guys remember three hours of your

00:55:12.804 --> 00:55:13.863
script every-- No, I'm kidding!

00:55:13.863 --> 00:55:17.709
MATT: (laughs) Well, we spend the whole week
rehearsing leading up to it. We got like four

00:55:17.709 --> 00:55:20.029
days, we have dress rehearsal on Wednesday, it's
great.

00:55:20.029 --> 00:55:25.234
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah, so I was going to say, I
actually started DMing because of you guys.

00:55:25.234 --> 00:55:32.541
Completely custom world, everything. One of the
things I've struggled with, I've watched DM Tips

00:55:32.541 --> 00:55:37.853
and everything, how do you keep track? I'm trying
to keep the game flowing, trying to keep the

00:55:37.853 --> 00:55:43.473
narrative going, trying to get my players
involved, and I struggle. They'll ask, "Oh, what's

00:55:43.473 --> 00:55:50.255
"this guard's name?" "Oh, his name's Jim." "Okay,
great." How do you keep track of that? If I stop

00:55:50.255 --> 00:55:53.945
to write the notes, I feel like I'm slowing the
narrative down sometimes. How do you keep track of

00:55:53.945 --> 00:55:54.973
that stuff during the game?

00:55:54.973 --> 00:56:00.063
MATT: When the players are talking, especially to
each other, that's where you write down notes. So

00:56:00.063 --> 00:56:03.564
when you think up, "That guy's name is Jim." All
right, cool, you meet Jim, you talk about Jim, and

00:56:03.564 --> 00:56:07.957
as soon as they're like, "All right, where do we
go next?" Just be like, (quiet mutter) "Jim." Not

00:56:07.957 --> 00:56:11.145
necessarily writing in the moment, if you feel
like you need to stay engaged, continue to do so,

00:56:11.145 --> 00:56:15.545
and the moment they start talking to each other,
listen, and write a note. Assuming they do it a

00:56:15.545 --> 00:56:22.283
lot, just be like, "Oh, they're talking? Cool. Ah
yes!" It's finding the balance of the downtime

00:56:22.283 --> 00:56:25.335
when they're all focused on you, that's when you
can go ahead and write your notes.

00:56:25.335 --> 00:56:26.436
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Awesome. Appreciate it.

00:56:26.436 --> 00:56:26.945
MATT: No worries.

00:56:26.945 --> 00:56:36.374
AUDIENCE MEMBER: All right, I'm running out of
time. A voice actor that I think would be really

00:56:36.585 --> 00:56:44.092
good to be on Critical Role, and that Mary knows:
Steve Blum! Why can't we get him on Critical Role?

00:56:44.092 --> 00:56:51.084
MATT: Look, you think we haven't tried? It's
interesting. This has been a unique experience,

00:56:51.084 --> 00:56:57.467
since we started the show. A lot of people are not
comfortable streaming their D&D game. We've asked

00:56:57.467 --> 00:57:01.784
a lot of people. One of the frustrating things
I've had is we've tried to invite a lot of people

00:57:01.784 --> 00:57:07.702
on from different diverse backgrounds and
ethnicities, because we're a bunch of white kids

00:57:07.702 --> 00:57:08.538
who play D&D--

00:57:08.538 --> 00:57:10.900
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Nerdy-ass voice actors. We get
it.

00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:17.096
MATT: Yeah. It's shitty that in order to bring
more diversity into our show, I'd have to fire

00:57:17.096 --> 00:57:21.817
friends from our group, and I don't want to do
that. So our guests are an opportunity to bring

00:57:21.817 --> 00:57:26.964
more people in, but a lot of people I've reached
out to about it are like, "Nah, I'm good. It's a

00:57:26.964 --> 00:57:28.125
"little nerdy for me."

00:57:28.125 --> 00:57:31.625
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I hope we're not that
intimidating to them.

00:57:31.625 --> 00:57:35.991
MATT: Well no, but for some people it is and I've
noticed that. Steve, very much, he's like, "I

00:57:36.167 --> 00:57:39.652
"don't want to do this online." But the more that
it's gone, and the more that people have been more

00:57:39.652 --> 00:57:43.291
welcoming in the community, it's been more
positive, it's starting to turn around. Deborah

00:57:43.291 --> 00:57:47.643
Ann Woll, who you know from Daredevil and stuff,
we asked her to be a guest two years ago, and she

00:57:47.643 --> 00:57:51.730
said no. She said, "This is a personal thing for
me, and going on the internet in front of a lot of

00:57:51.730 --> 00:57:55.156
people to flame me for this, I don't want to do
it." I completely understand and respect that.

00:57:55.156 --> 00:58:01.000
Since then, she's been like, "It's actually fun."
We've hung out a bit, she's really cool, so I may

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:05.538
try and bring her in for a guest in this season.
So we'll see. It's starting to change, but it's

00:58:05.538 --> 00:58:10.301
been a challenge to get people to come in, because
when you're on the internet, you're exposing a lot

00:58:10.301 --> 00:58:14.879
of yourself in a space that's improvised and very
open and very sensitive and the internet isn't

00:58:14.879 --> 00:58:17.040
always kind. We're trying!

00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:17.731
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.

00:58:17.731 --> 00:58:23.349
MATT: No worries. Thank you. I think we have time
for one more question. I'm so sorry for those who

00:58:23.349 --> 00:58:26.940
didn't make it! I'm so sorry! I apologize, but I
love you all.

00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:31.049
(audience sighing, applause)

00:58:31.049 --> 00:58:33.509
MATT: Look at this amazing man! Jeffrey?

00:58:33.509 --> 00:58:35.820
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You son of a bitch.

00:58:35.820 --> 00:58:39.241
(laughter)

00:58:39.241 --> 00:58:40.570
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I love you, man.

00:58:40.570 --> 00:58:42.171
MATT: That's awesome. Hi, buddy!

00:58:42.171 --> 00:58:47.850
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi. Met you earlier today for the
autograph session, and I said it earlier and I

00:58:47.850 --> 00:58:52.787
want to say it again, but I didn't start with
Critical Role or you; a friend actually

00:58:52.787 --> 00:59:01.390
recommended me towards Matt Colville, and I saw
his Running the Game series, and that made me see

00:59:01.390 --> 00:59:07.878
DMing as less difficult, scary, or so much hard
work. That's what inspired me to actually start

00:59:07.878 --> 00:59:14.863
pursuing Dungeons & Dragons again. To start
running the game, and then I found you, and that

00:59:14.863 --> 00:59:21.409
inspired the way that I want to DM. Much less
murder hobo and stuff like that, just

00:59:21.409 --> 00:59:30.088
<i>storytelling</i>. One thing I've run into that I
find difficult and I wanted to ask was, of all the

00:59:30.088 --> 00:59:36.400
voices that you do and the characters that you've
made, how would one get into voice acting to make

00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:42.576
those voices, to make these characters feel so
much more unique and their own with the voices

00:59:42.576 --> 00:59:43.473
that you do?

00:59:43.473 --> 00:59:47.430
MATT: Basically how to develop voices for the
game?

00:59:47.430 --> 00:59:48.278
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes.

00:59:48.278 --> 00:59:57.339
MATT: Practice. Whenever I'm in the shower, whenever I'm
driving my car, whenever I'm by myself, for the

00:59:57.544 --> 01:00:02.568
most part (occasionally when Marisha's around),
I'll be improvising, doing impressions, or trying

01:00:02.568 --> 01:00:08.977
to come up with weird voices and dialects. I talk
to myself a lot. That's a good place to figure

01:00:08.977 --> 01:00:12.828
things out. If you come up with an interesting
voice that you've never done before, you can pull

01:00:12.828 --> 01:00:16.869
up your phone and record yourself and you can
listen to it later to replicate it. The more you

01:00:16.869 --> 01:00:21.069
practice these different voices, the more
comfortable you are pulling them out at the drop

01:00:21.069 --> 01:00:25.746
of a hat. Also, when you write down NPCs or you're
creating characters for your campaign, taking

01:00:25.746 --> 01:00:29.882
notes of what kind of voice it is is a really good
reference point whenever you have to go back to

01:00:29.882 --> 01:00:38.129
the character. You could write, "low gravelly," or
"high-pitched and reedy," or "cockney accent," or

01:00:38.129 --> 01:00:43.302
"really terrible Russian accent." Things that when
you glance at the NPC sheet, you already have a

01:00:43.302 --> 01:00:47.236
ballpark idea of where they were before, then you
can jump into it. It comes with experience. It

01:00:47.236 --> 01:00:51.537
comes with listening and repeating and trying to
copy other voices out there. Even if you don't

01:00:51.537 --> 01:00:55.999
become a good impressionist, in the process of
trying it, you'll find your own unique voices,

01:00:55.999 --> 01:01:00.060
different things you didn't know you could do
beforehand. Recording yourself, listening to it,

01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:04.611
practicing, and don't be afraid to try them out in
the middle of the campaign. Even if your friends

01:01:04.611 --> 01:01:06.450
give you shit for it, they're your friends, it'll
be fine.

01:01:06.450 --> 01:01:16.230
[applause]

01:01:16.230 --> 01:01:18.704
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I just want to say you're an
inspiration to us all. Thank you for the advice.

01:01:18.704 --> 01:01:20.030
MATT: You guys are an inspiration to me!

01:01:20.030 --> 01:01:25.482
MIC RUNNER: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls
of all ages, let's give it up to Matt Mercer!

01:01:25.482 --> 01:01:26.654
That's our time for today.

01:01:26.654 --> 01:01:27.198
MATT: Thank you!

01:01:27.198 --> 01:01:32.790
MIC RUNNER: At this time, I want to ask the
cosplayers: please follow this young lady right

01:01:32.790 --> 01:01:35.700
over here. We're going to go backstage real quick.
Cosplayers only.

01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:38.420
MATT: You guys are amazing!

01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:43.252
MIC RUNNER: The Critical Role cosplayers, sorry.
Critical Role cosplayers, allow me to specify.

01:01:43.252 --> 01:01:48.340
Once again, I need all Critical Role cosplayers.
Please come step to the side.

01:01:48.340 --> 01:02:36.361
[jazzy piano music]
