1
00:00:01,322 --> 00:00:06,578
TALIESIN: Finish it! Finish it, I dare you!

2
00:00:06,578 --> 00:00:13,358
(cheering)

3
00:00:13,358 --> 00:00:19,152
TALIESIN: Good evening, everybody. Welcome to
terrible decisions in my life. Welcome to Critical

4
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:26,345
Role. We are doing Vampire: The Masquerade. Sort
of. Well, we're going to talk about it. We're

5
00:00:26,345 --> 00:00:31,581
doing kind of a homebrew thing. It's going to be
fun. It's going to be weird. It's going to be dark

6
00:00:31,581 --> 00:00:36,916
and really inappropriate and I'm so sorry. If any
of you are a little squeamish, it's going to get a

7
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:51,319
little weird, and I'm so sorry. I was a big fan of
this game 25 years ago. This game and the World of

8
00:00:51,319 --> 00:00:57,158
Darkness, Werewolf: The Apocalypse, Mage: The
Ascension, Changeling: The Dreaming, and all of

9
00:00:57,158 --> 00:01:03,365
these games were a big part of all of our lives
and they really affected us and changed us. It was

10
00:01:03,365 --> 00:01:08,545
an introduction to roleplaying for a lot of
people who may not have been comfortable with

11
00:01:08,545 --> 00:01:15,145
Dungeons &amp; Dragons of something obviously much
more serious, because look at us. We're so much

12
00:01:15,145 --> 00:01:25,596
more serious right now. The build that we're going
to be running is kind of a mix of, as I'm checking

13
00:01:25,596 --> 00:01:36,830
my notes, the new v5 Alpha. It's also a little bit of
Onyx, it's a bit of my old homebrew that I found

14
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:42,211
bits and pieces of while cleaning my room, all
mushed together. If you're interested in this

15
00:01:42,211 --> 00:01:47,206
game, there's a brand-new version in Alpha right
now that you can play around with. There's also

16
00:01:47,206 --> 00:01:54,894
the old school stuff that Onyx has put out which
is the size of a small library. You can go in and

17
00:01:54,894 --> 00:02:00,828
find books on every city and every type of
creature you could want. There's weird, angry 80s

18
00:02:00,828 --> 00:02:09,575
versions of everybody. I want to do a special
thanks to Jason Carl, White Wolf, Onyx Path, and Don

19
00:02:09,575 --> 00:02:12,710
and Katherine, if you're watching, for running
really good games, and Sasha and Juliet for

20
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:17,371
running very good games. Sasha's not watching;
she's at marching band. You've got marching to do.

21
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:19,558
SAM: This music, Taliesin.

22
00:02:19,558 --> 00:02:27,729
TALIESIN: This is Syrinscape. I hit a random
button in their Creepy Asylum set. It's rocking.

23
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:31,983
We have some announcements that, in theory, I was
supposed to have, but I don't. I know some of them

24
00:02:31,983 --> 00:02:33,342
off the top of my head.

25
00:02:33,342 --> 00:02:35,581
SAM: I can help you out there, Taliesin.

26
00:02:35,581 --> 00:02:37,285
TALIESIN: You can start there with Backblaze.

27
00:02:37,285 --> 00:02:45,824
SAM: Is the camera on me? Our sponsor tonight is
Backblaze! Yev from Backblaze is back again to

28
00:02:45,824 --> 00:02:53,383
peddle his wares. Backblaze is unlimited backup
for Macs and PCs. You can use mobile apps to

29
00:02:53,383 --> 00:02:59,892
access data on the go. You can recover files by
mail using a flash key or hard drive. They'll ship

30
00:02:59,892 --> 00:03:06,484
it to your door to restore your data. And you get
a 15-day, fully-featured free trial if you go to

31
00:03:06,484 --> 00:03:15,178
backblaze.com/criticalrole. To honor our fine
people at Backblaze, I have composed a rap in the

32
00:03:15,178 --> 00:03:21,998
style of Sir Mix-A-Lot. Ahem. Oh boy, I should
have rehearsed this.

33
00:03:21,998 --> 00:03:26,248
TALIESIN: You and me fucking both.

34
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:32,101
SAM: I like backups and I cannot lie! Those other
brothers can't deny! When a virus hits and your

35
00:03:32,101 --> 00:03:36,673
hard drive quits, but you backed up all your shit
you get sprung! Wanna act all tough 'cause you

36
00:03:36,673 --> 00:03:38,817
know it's all backed up. So fellas!

37
00:03:38,817 --> 00:03:39,567
TRAVIS and MATT: Yeah!

38
00:03:39,567 --> 00:03:40,241
SAM: Fellas!

39
00:03:40,241 --> 00:03:40,989
TRAVIS and MATT: Yeah!

40
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:42,057
SAM: Storing lots of porn?

41
00:03:42,057 --> 00:03:43,606
TRAVIS and MATT: Yeah!

42
00:03:43,606 --> 00:03:44,542
SAM: You better store it!

43
00:03:44,542 --> 00:03:45,200
TRAVIS and MATT: Store it!

44
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:45,922
SAM: Hoard it!

45
00:03:45,922 --> 00:03:46,680
TRAVIS and MATT: Hoard it!

46
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,187
SAM: Store those gigs of smut! Baby got
Backblaze!

47
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:51,750
(cheering)

48
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,612
TRAVIS: Yeah! Backblaze rap!

49
00:03:55,612 --> 00:03:57,562
SAM: Backblaze! Check it out.

50
00:03:57,562 --> 00:04:00,031
TALIESIN: Wow, it's only uphill from here. That's
good.

51
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,993
LAURA: Very nice, Sam.

52
00:04:01,993 --> 00:04:03,536
TALIESIN: That was beautiful.

53
00:04:03,536 --> 00:04:06,274
LIAM: So we're all vampires tonight, right?

54
00:04:06,274 --> 00:04:07,146
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

55
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:08,944
LIAM: Is the camera even picking us up?

56
00:04:08,944 --> 00:04:10,060
LAURA: I know; can you see us?

57
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,313
LIAM: Can you see us?

58
00:04:11,313 --> 00:04:14,149
TRAVIS: Just your jewelry floating around in the
empty space.

59
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:18,541
TALIESIN: I was about to be nerdy enough to say
that all vampires in the White Wolf universe are

60
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:23,323
picked up by electronics. Yeah. There's only one
clan that even is not reflected in the

61
00:04:23,323 --> 00:04:24,622
mirror.

62
00:04:24,622 --> 00:04:25,821
LIAM: I was just testing you.

63
00:04:25,821 --> 00:04:31,132
TALIESIN: I know some of this! I don't know all of
it. I remember some of this from high school. Got

64
00:04:31,132 --> 00:04:36,091
to be able to LARP this stuff. Do we have anything
new in merch?

65
00:04:36,091 --> 00:04:44,634
LAURA: Well, it's the same stuff in merch, but we
also have the art book coming out! The one we

66
00:04:44,634 --> 00:04:45,583
talked about.

67
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:47,050
SAM: Oh, the new comic!

68
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,513
LIAM: Scanlan and Grog.

69
00:04:48,513 --> 00:04:49,840
SAM: Did you read it?

70
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,225
TRAVIS: I did.

71
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:52,573
SAM: It's good, right?

72
00:04:52,573 --> 00:04:54,797
TRAVIS: The troublesome twosome. Pretty sweet.

73
00:04:54,797 --> 00:04:56,155
SAM: Pretty good.

74
00:04:56,155 --> 00:04:58,858
TALIESIN: Putting it out there for anyone watching
that I don't have the rest of the announcements,

75
00:04:58,858 --> 00:05:03,178
so if there's anything that anybody wanted me to
say, they should put it on here with a piece of

76
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:04,951
paper at some point.

77
00:05:04,951 --> 00:05:06,853
TRAVIS: The comic book is amazing. Beardless
Grog.

78
00:05:06,923 --> 00:05:08,160
SAM: Oh yeah!

79
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,153
TRAVIS: He's like a baby! A baby in the woods.

80
00:05:11,153 --> 00:05:18,388
MARISHA: It's weird looking at your D&amp;D characters
and being like, "Oh! They were so young! They were babies!"

81
00:05:18,388 --> 00:05:22,427
LAURA: Oh look, they're alive!

82
00:05:22,427 --> 00:05:26,744
TRAVIS: The writing is fucking brilliant, as
always, Colville is amazing. Olivia Samson.

83
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:29,774
SAM: Good action, good art. It's good stuff.

84
00:05:29,774 --> 00:05:34,844
TALIESIN: We're going to be doing Slave Labor
Graphics on Wednesday Club. It's going to be

85
00:05:34,844 --> 00:05:40,531
Johnny The Homicidal Maniac and all sorts of gothy
comic books for Halloween. We're going to be doing

86
00:05:40,531 --> 00:05:46,569
Gather Your Ghost tomorrow because it's funny when
I do a show three days in a row. Four days in a

87
00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:47,760
row here!

88
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,566
MARISHA: Sagas of Sundry: Madness is coming out
next week! Yeah!

89
00:05:51,566 --> 00:05:53,991
LAURA: Should have worn the black wig tonight!

90
00:05:53,991 --> 00:05:56,506
MARISHA: I thought it would be spoilery.

91
00:05:56,506 --> 00:05:59,345
TALIESIN: You had free time; you could have pulled
that together.

92
00:05:59,345 --> 00:06:02,430
MARISHA: Yeah, I thought about it. I was like,
"Should I? Eh."

93
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:07,713
TALIESIN: Trying to think if there was anything
else off the top of my head. I feel like I'm

94
00:06:07,713 --> 00:06:09,244
missing something.

95
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:15,405
MATT: Vamp as much as you want, Taliesin, you have
to start the game soon. (laughter) Look, I don't

96
00:06:15,405 --> 00:06:17,751
get to enjoy giving you shit from this side of the
table.

97
00:06:17,751 --> 00:06:24,313
TALIESIN: For the record, this is intimidating!
Holy cow. I feel like I want to adjust my desktop

98
00:06:24,313 --> 00:06:26,253
settings. This is a lot.

99
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:27,579
LAURA: I'm scared of it.

100
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:34,054
TALIESIN: You should be. This is evil and
terrible. This is a brand-new game system, so

101
00:06:34,054 --> 00:06:40,152
we're going to be taking it slow. For those of you
at home who know Vampire: The Masquerade, this is

102
00:06:40,152 --> 00:06:46,212
going to be a very barebones thing. We've cut a
lot of fat. We've cut a lot of something. We've

103
00:06:46,212 --> 00:06:52,568
cut a lot of limbs from this baby, but it is going
to be dark. There are going to be hints of what's

104
00:06:52,568 --> 00:06:58,464
going on in the real world, but we're keeping this
very insulated, so it's not going to be a lot of

105
00:06:58,464 --> 00:06:59,906
world-building. Ah, thank you!

106
00:06:59,906 --> 00:07:05,535
TRAVIS: There's also going to be a Talks Machina
next week on Tuesday discussing this one shot.

107
00:07:05,535 --> 00:07:06,514
SAM: Oh, really?

108
00:07:06,514 --> 00:07:07,450
TRAVIS: Yes, there will be.

109
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,070
SAM: Is it going to have a different name?

110
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:14,717
TALIESIN: No. Don't forget to submit your gif and
fanart of the week to submit@talksmachina.com.

111
00:07:14,717 --> 00:07:16,849
You're still in Batman, which is great.

112
00:07:16,849 --> 00:07:19,930
MATT: Yeah! Still there; they haven't gotten rid
of me yet.

113
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:24,216
TALIESIN: I don't know if we're talking about
Thrashtopia yet, but eventually we're talking

114
00:07:24,216 --> 00:07:25,983
about Thrashtopia because Thrashtopia's cool.

115
00:07:25,983 --> 00:07:29,425
MARISHA: Yeah. Thrashtopia has been uttered into
the universe.

116
00:07:29,425 --> 00:07:33,529
TALIESIN: CR podcast is now available through
Amazon Alexa, apparently, which I did not know.

117
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:37,803
It's available on Amazon Echo, Echo Dot, Echo
Plus, and other Alexa-enabled devices.

118
00:07:37,803 --> 00:07:40,967
MATT: Maybe you just yell loud into a canyon, it
echoes back to you.

119
00:07:40,967 --> 00:07:43,325
TALIESIN: Just say, "Alexa, how do you want to do
this?" and it plays.

120
00:07:43,325 --> 00:07:44,958
LAURA: That would be amazing! Wouldn't it?!

121
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:48,389
MARISHA: Could we make that happen? I'm going to
talk to Ben!

122
00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:50,148
TALIESIN: I don't know how things work.

123
00:07:50,148 --> 00:07:51,786
MARISHA: Ben. Let's make it happen.

124
00:07:51,786 --> 00:07:54,089
TALIESIN: I think that's what Ben wanted me to
say. Ben.

125
00:07:54,089 --> 00:07:55,727
LAURA: It's so cool. Make it so.

126
00:07:55,727 --> 00:08:02,217
TALIESIN: This'll be a d10 system, so everyone
remembers. It's going to be a six and above is a win.

127
00:08:02,217 --> 00:08:04,234
LAURA: I've got so many d10s in my tray right
now.

128
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:07,405
TALIESIN: I'll explain the red dice. We're going
to take this through, and it's going to be really

129
00:08:07,405 --> 00:08:15,341
weird. I am so sorry for everything that's about
to happen. I'm going to try to maintain my cool.

130
00:08:15,341 --> 00:08:17,150
MARISHA: Let's do this shit!

131
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:20,580
TALIESIN: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
hopefully people who are not too young to be

132
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:27,386
scarred for life: prepare for Critical Role: Goth
Vampire Edition.

133
00:08:27,386 --> 00:09:58,378
[dramatic music]

134
00:09:58,378 --> 00:10:07,599
(laughter)

135
00:10:07,599 --> 00:10:11,656
MATT: I legitimately can say I understand.

136
00:10:11,656 --> 00:10:13,666
TALIESIN: It's not going to save you.

137
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:14,835
MATT: I know.

138
00:10:14,835 --> 00:10:27,022
TALIESIN: All right. When we last left off, we
were finishing up a very emotional, very heavy and

139
00:10:27,022 --> 00:10:29,517
intense episode of Critical Role.

140
00:10:29,517 --> 00:10:31,284
LAURA: Oh my god. Super meta.

141
00:10:31,284 --> 00:10:37,217
TALIESIN: We're going meta, people. It was a tough
time; everyone went home. We packed up our stuff.

142
00:10:37,217 --> 00:10:44,872
Made our way out to our cars in the parking lot.
And that's the last thing you remember before it

143
00:10:44,872 --> 00:10:59,625
all went black. You have been away for some time.
You don't know how long it's been. You don't know

144
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:10,038
where you are. You don't feel quite right. You
feel disconnected. Something's a little off.

145
00:11:10,038 --> 00:11:18,469
You're hungry, you're thirsty, you're not entirely
sure, but you're waking up and it is pitch black.

146
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:23,413
LAURA: Is there anyone around us?

147
00:11:23,413 --> 00:11:31,519
TALIESIN: Can you see anything? Take a look! It's
very dark and there's nothing around. You're lying

148
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,922
on your back.

149
00:11:32,922 --> 00:11:34,818
LIAM: Each of us alone?

150
00:11:34,818 --> 00:11:36,135
TALIESIN: Each of you alone.

151
00:11:36,135 --> 00:11:39,554
LAURA: Put my hand up and feel.

152
00:11:39,554 --> 00:11:40,924
TALIESIN: Yes, you are in a coffin.

153
00:11:40,924 --> 00:11:44,162
(yelling)

154
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:45,446
MARISHA: Oh god!

155
00:11:45,446 --> 00:11:49,164
SAM: I'm going to start shouting. Hello! Can
anyone hear me?

156
00:11:49,164 --> 00:11:51,081
TALIESIN: You're a voice actor. You call that
shouting?

157
00:11:51,081 --> 00:11:56,715
SAM: It's me, Sam Riegel of Critical Role!

158
00:11:56,715 --> 00:12:03,569
TALIESIN: The sound is deadened by the thick wood
and the fabric.

159
00:12:03,569 --> 00:12:06,965
LAURA: Can we try to push?

160
00:12:06,965 --> 00:12:14,814
TALIESIN: Yeah, give me a strength plus melee.

161
00:12:14,814 --> 00:12:18,291
MATT: I'm going to Uma Thurman.

162
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:21,571
MARISHA: That's what I was going to do. I'm trying
to one-inch punch this.

163
00:12:21,571 --> 00:12:23,831
TRAVIS: Me too.

164
00:12:23,831 --> 00:12:26,073
LAURA: A ten and a six.

165
00:12:26,073 --> 00:12:28,272
TALIESIN: A ten and a six, that's two successes.

166
00:12:28,272 --> 00:12:31,494
LIAM: I got a ten and this X-ed-out one.

167
00:12:31,554 --> 00:12:32,795
TALIESIN: Oh no.

168
00:12:32,795 --> 00:12:33,806
LAURA: That's bad.

169
00:12:33,806 --> 00:12:35,212
LIAM: I figured as much.

170
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,986
LAURA: You succeeded and you failed.

171
00:12:36,986 --> 00:12:38,927
MATT: That's okay. I failed as well.

172
00:12:38,927 --> 00:12:43,743
MARISHA: What do we roll for the one-inch
punch thing?

173
00:12:43,743 --> 00:12:46,634
SAM: So you got an X-ed-out one as well?

174
00:12:46,634 --> 00:12:54,245
TALIESIN: Liam, something's wrong. You go up to
touch your face, and it doesn't feel right. It

175
00:12:54,245 --> 00:13:00,647
feels like papier-mache, there's something weird.
Laura, you rolled how many?

176
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:03,400
LAURA: Two successes. That's all I could roll.

177
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,182
TALIESIN: How many did you get?

178
00:13:05,182 --> 00:13:06,839
MARISHA: What do I roll for one-inch punching?

179
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:08,382
TALIESIN: Strength plus melee.

180
00:13:08,382 --> 00:13:12,450
MARISHA: Do I use the red?

181
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,443
TALIESIN: You have to always use at least two
of the red.

182
00:13:14,443 --> 00:13:16,082
MARISHA: Always two, copy that.

183
00:13:16,082 --> 00:13:17,857
TALIESIN: Whatever red you have, you have to use.

184
00:13:17,857 --> 00:13:25,159
MARISHA: Okay. I don't know what that means, but
I'm into it. All are successes but two.

185
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:27,677
LAURA: Both of the reds are successes.

186
00:13:27,677 --> 00:13:29,055
MARISHA: Four successes.

187
00:13:29,055 --> 00:13:37,683
TALIESIN: You give a sharp push and the top of the
coffin cracks a bit. It snaps.

188
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:39,350
MARISHA: Shit, I fucking broke it!

189
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:44,686
MATT: My strength is two, my melee is zero, which
is accurate.

190
00:13:44,686 --> 00:13:46,277
TALIESIN: You're welcome.

191
00:13:46,277 --> 00:13:51,947
MATT: I rolled a five and a one. So a failure and
whatever the X means.

192
00:13:51,947 --> 00:13:54,003
TALIESIN: You're feeling a little queasy.

193
00:13:54,003 --> 00:13:55,383
MATT: That's about right.

194
00:13:55,383 --> 00:13:58,802
TALIESIN: You're not feeling good. You got to hold
on.

195
00:13:58,802 --> 00:14:00,334
SAM: One success.

196
00:14:00,334 --> 00:14:05,836
TALIESIN: One success? All right. You give it a
push and it moves a little bit. Got a little shove.

197
00:14:05,836 --> 00:14:07,498
TRAVIS: Three successes.

198
00:14:07,498 --> 00:14:13,985
TALIESIN: The coffin cover cracks in half. That's
as far as you've gotten.

199
00:14:13,985 --> 00:14:15,370
LAURA: What did mine do?

200
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:21,369
TALIESIN: Yours got a good little shove. If there
was something to see outside, you would see

201
00:14:21,369 --> 00:14:28,053
something, but there's not yet. You start to hear
a little bit of a squeak. You feel something

202
00:14:28,053 --> 00:14:31,081
wriggling around inside the box with you.

203
00:14:31,081 --> 00:14:32,800
SAM: Like a mouse squeak?

204
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,420
TALIESIN: If a mouse were bigger.

205
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,970
MARISHA: Rats?

206
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:42,265
TALIESIN: That's a good guess. It could be
something rat-ish.

207
00:14:42,265 --> 00:14:44,260
LAURA: Do I want to eat the rat-ish?

208
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,458
TALIESIN: I don't know; do you?

209
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:46,812
TRAVIS: Do you like radishes?

210
00:14:46,812 --> 00:14:47,966
LAURA: Maybe.

211
00:14:47,966 --> 00:14:56,003
TALIESIN: You're definitely feeling hungry, and it
does strangely smell appetizing.

212
00:14:56,003 --> 00:14:57,876
LAURA: Can I catch it and eat it?

213
00:14:57,876 --> 00:15:03,600
TALIESIN: Give me a dex roll.

214
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,067
LAURA: Just dex?

215
00:15:05,067 --> 00:15:09,812
TALIESIN: Give me dex athletics, just to be fun.
See what that does.

216
00:15:09,812 --> 00:15:11,591
MARISHA: We all have rats in there?

217
00:15:11,591 --> 00:15:12,660
TALIESIN: Yeah.

218
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,961
LAURA: Where's my athletics?

219
00:15:13,961 --> 00:15:15,330
TALIESIN: Top of physical.

220
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:22,714
LAURA: I don't have athletics. Yes I do. Shut up.

221
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:26,340
TALIESIN: These are complicated. It's going to
take a second.

222
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:32,972
LAURA: Oh okay. Success, success, success, and two
failures.

223
00:15:32,972 --> 00:15:34,345
TALIESIN: Two failures?

224
00:15:34,345 --> 00:15:35,684
LAURA: But three successes!

225
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:36,992
TALIESIN: Are the two failures on red dice?

226
00:15:36,992 --> 00:15:39,798
LAURA: No, one is on a red, and one is a success
on a red.

227
00:15:39,798 --> 00:15:50,143
TALIESIN: Okay. You grab the rat and it bites you.
But you're holding on. You're still not feeling

228
00:15:50,143 --> 00:15:51,768
very well, you can't react yet.

229
00:15:51,768 --> 00:15:56,980
LIAM: Is there enough room to bring my knees up
and start pushing with feet and hands?

230
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:00,755
TALIESIN: Not yet, but soon. You're still a little
weirded out by your face.

231
00:16:00,755 --> 00:16:02,833
MARISHA: I'm up, right?

232
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,604
TALIESIN: You're still in your coffin.

233
00:16:04,604 --> 00:16:09,309
TRAVIS: Can I reach my fingers through the crack
in the top of the coffin and see if there's any

234
00:16:09,309 --> 00:16:11,660
light, cold, or anything?

235
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:16,365
TALIESIN: You feel wood, I suppose. There's
another layer of wood above you.

236
00:16:16,365 --> 00:16:18,382
LAURA: What?

237
00:16:18,382 --> 00:16:20,820
TRAVIS: No light?

238
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,891
TALIESIN: No light. Not yet.

239
00:16:22,891 --> 00:16:31,655
SAM: I'm yelling: I am an internet celebrity!
People know me! Not many people. In obscure

240
00:16:31,655 --> 00:16:34,442
corners, but mostly in gaming stores.

241
00:16:34,442 --> 00:16:38,714
MARISHA: Situationally famous.

242
00:16:38,714 --> 00:16:41,706
TALIESIN: Do you want to do something with that
rat?

243
00:16:41,706 --> 00:16:44,046
LAURA: Yeah! I want to bite it like I just ate
that donut!

244
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:45,269
TRAVIS: Gross.

245
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:51,258
TALIESIN: Take a big bite of that rat. All right,
so give me one of your red dice.

246
00:16:51,258 --> 00:16:52,971
LAURA: Oh no!

247
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:53,900
TALIESIN: No, that's good.

248
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,620
LAURA: Okay.

249
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:59,311
TALIESIN: Mark your hunger, if you have a pencil,
to just one X.

250
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:01,987
LAURA: It's on the very bottom.

251
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:03,457
TALIESIN: Just one.

252
00:17:03,457 --> 00:17:08,678
LIAM: Who's that at the window? Hunger! Ooh,
hunger!

253
00:17:08,678 --> 00:17:14,963
TALIESIN: I love that show. You're feeling a
little better. You're feeling a little more

254
00:17:14,963 --> 00:17:20,056
clear-headed. This is not a good situation.

255
00:17:20,056 --> 00:17:22,673
LAURA: Did I just eat a rat?

256
00:17:22,673 --> 00:17:25,745
TALIESIN: You did just eat a rat. I'm going to
point out: it's not that you're not hungry any

257
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:29,052
more. You're still hungry; you're just feeling a
little better.

258
00:17:29,052 --> 00:17:33,424
LIAM: Am I so distracted with my face--

259
00:17:33,424 --> 00:17:35,277
TALIESIN: No, you're good now.

260
00:17:35,277 --> 00:17:37,486
LIAM: Okay, all fours, pushing.

261
00:17:37,486 --> 00:17:45,468
TALIESIN: Give a good push. Give me either, yeah,
fun, strength brawl or strength athletics to see

262
00:17:45,468 --> 00:17:47,463
if you can push it off.

263
00:17:47,463 --> 00:17:55,445
LIAM: (grunting) I don't like it in here! The red
is a ten and a two. And then a nine and one on the

264
00:17:55,445 --> 00:17:58,456
other dice. So success, success, failure,
failure.

265
00:17:58,456 --> 00:18:10,684
TALIESIN: You got the coffin lid about halfway off
now. You can almost make out a layer of wood above you.

266
00:18:10,684 --> 00:18:16,414
MARISHA: I'm going to give another whack where
I've already indented it. Same roll?

267
00:18:16,414 --> 00:18:21,797
TALIESIN: Yeah, strength brawl or strength melee.
I'll give you options now.

268
00:18:21,797 --> 00:18:23,908
LAURA: You have a better melee than brawl?

269
00:18:23,908 --> 00:18:30,471
MARISHA: Yeah, it doesn't make a lot of sense. I
don't quite understand it. Okay. Three successes

270
00:18:30,471 --> 00:18:32,767
and three failures, two failures on the red.

271
00:18:32,767 --> 00:18:34,223
TALIESIN: Two failures on the red?

272
00:18:34,223 --> 00:18:35,535
MARISHA: Yeah.

273
00:18:35,535 --> 00:18:39,999
TALIESIN: Ooh, that's interesting. I'm learning
how this works, one second.

274
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:47,487
TRAVIS: I like this! She eats her hand.

275
00:18:47,487 --> 00:18:51,338
LAURA: Oh my god, what if she does?! What if she
eats her own flesh?!

276
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:54,369
TALIESIN: Things can happen, man, I'm not going to
say.

277
00:18:54,369 --> 00:18:55,862
MARISHA: Bucket list check?

278
00:18:55,862 --> 00:19:00,782
LAURA: Make sure it's a digit you don't use very
much.

279
00:19:00,782 --> 00:19:03,405
MARISHA: Start with the pinkies and work your way
back?

280
00:19:03,405 --> 00:19:05,737
MATT: How will you pinky swear?

281
00:19:05,737 --> 00:19:08,667
TALIESIN: I'm so sorry, I'm trying to find my one
hunger.

282
00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:10,658
LIAM: You don't pinky swear with evil people.

283
00:19:10,658 --> 00:19:16,239
LAURA: Evil people don't pinky swear! Evil people
middle finger swear!

284
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:18,499
MARISHA: Middle finger swear, yeah!

285
00:19:18,499 --> 00:19:22,780
LIAM, LAURA, and MARISHA: Middle finger!

286
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:34,797
TALIESIN: Yeah, you don't feel well at all. You
start scratching at your wrists. You start digging

287
00:19:34,797 --> 00:19:38,590
in a little bit. You're going to take one damage
and you're going to start sucking your own blood

288
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,371
because things are getting weird.

289
00:19:40,371 --> 00:19:41,517
TRAVIS: Oh shit!

290
00:19:41,517 --> 00:19:43,073
MARISHA: So dehydrated, you guys!

291
00:19:43,073 --> 00:19:45,234
TRAVIS: So much crying since last week!

292
00:19:45,234 --> 00:19:51,742
TALIESIN: You're going to take one damage and
sadly, you're getting a little weird.

293
00:19:51,742 --> 00:19:56,840
LAURA: You get another red die! I don't even know
what it means!

294
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,828
LIAM: She has to roll three of them.

295
00:19:58,828 --> 00:20:00,528
LAURA: It's all so mysterious!

296
00:20:00,528 --> 00:20:08,948
MATT: I notice the rat's there and I look at my
broken hand. So instead, I decide I'm going to try

297
00:20:08,948 --> 00:20:12,103
to coax it near me. Hey! Hey little guy! Hey
buddy!

298
00:20:12,103 --> 00:20:15,534
TALIESIN: I'm going to give charisma animal ken.

299
00:20:15,534 --> 00:20:21,881
LAURA: That's good! I guess we have to lean into
our strengths.

300
00:20:21,881 --> 00:20:23,639
TALIESIN: That's a good idea.

301
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,982
TRAVIS: Oh no.

302
00:20:25,982 --> 00:20:28,929
MATT: Six or above you said? That's three
successes.

303
00:20:28,929 --> 00:20:35,069
TALIESIN: It thinks that you are the nicest,
sweetest, most wonderful person and is so excited

304
00:20:35,069 --> 00:20:40,780
that it may get to play with you and be a part of
the game. It comes over and it's really--

305
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,138
MATT: How hungry am I?

306
00:20:42,138 --> 00:20:45,300
TALIESIN: You're two dice worth of hungry right
now, man, that's pretty hungry.

307
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,385
MATT: How cute is the rat?

308
00:20:46,385 --> 00:20:50,576
TALIESIN: It's not that cute. A pescatarian would
probably eat it.

309
00:20:50,576 --> 00:20:52,175
MATT: I'll eat the rat.

310
00:20:52,175 --> 00:20:56,634
TALIESIN: All right, good for you! Your hunger's at
one. Give me one of your die.

311
00:20:56,634 --> 00:21:01,985
MATT: Whee! It actually hit the rat!

312
00:21:01,985 --> 00:21:03,649
TALIESIN: You actually just knocked--

313
00:21:03,649 --> 00:21:04,989
MARISHA: Oh, buddy!

314
00:21:04,989 --> 00:21:09,443
TALIESIN: Poor guy. It's okay. He's going to
sleep. I'll get him his coffin later.

315
00:21:09,443 --> 00:21:13,062
LIAM: You can't see his penis any more!

316
00:21:13,062 --> 00:21:16,983
SAM: I'll roll to try to headbutt my way out of
here. Three successes!

317
00:21:16,983 --> 00:21:21,138
TALIESIN: You snap that in half, and now you've
just got wood.

318
00:21:21,138 --> 00:21:26,928
TRAVIS: I'm going to try and reach using my
superior strength and try and punch through that

319
00:21:26,928 --> 00:21:30,164
crack into the wood above.

320
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:31,591
SAM: Superior strength?

321
00:21:31,591 --> 00:21:34,026
LAURA: How many strengths does he have?

322
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:35,500
SAM: More than all of us.

323
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,747
TRAVIS: That's three successes and one failure
with the red.

324
00:21:38,747 --> 00:21:46,540
TALIESIN: One failure with the red? You crack
through, but some of the wood splinters and gets

325
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:52,499
lodged and you're going to spend a minute trying
to pull some chunks of wood out of your fist. That

326
00:21:52,499 --> 00:21:54,134
was a good shot, though.

327
00:21:54,134 --> 00:22:01,507
MARISHA: I'm going to go ahead and eat a rat, too.
Pop him off, Ozzy Osbourne-style.

328
00:22:01,507 --> 00:22:03,237
TALIESIN: You've got to catch the rat.

329
00:22:03,237 --> 00:22:05,816
MARISHA: I catch the rat and I eat it.

330
00:22:05,816 --> 00:22:07,637
TALIESIN: How are you going to catch the rat?

331
00:22:07,637 --> 00:22:09,095
MARISHA: How am I going to catch it?

332
00:22:09,095 --> 00:22:11,918
TALIESIN: How are you going to catch it? Gotta
catch 'em all!

333
00:22:11,918 --> 00:22:18,323
MARISHA: Do rats like-- hmm. What do rats like?

334
00:22:18,323 --> 00:22:21,923
TALIESIN: They like Disney films. Cheese. Amazon
gift cards.

335
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,982
LAURA: I don't think they really like cheese very
much.

336
00:22:23,982 --> 00:22:26,331
MARISHA: I'm going to do little rat scratches on
the--

337
00:22:26,331 --> 00:22:37,075
TALIESIN: You're going to do Pirates of the
Caribbean? Let's give you manipulation animal ken.

338
00:22:37,075 --> 00:22:39,149
MARISHA: I can manipulate animal ken!

339
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:42,188
LAURA: We're just so hungry.

340
00:22:42,188 --> 00:22:51,077
MARISHA: Come here, you little fucker. Three
successes, two failures. One failure on red.

341
00:22:51,077 --> 00:22:56,902
TALIESIN: One failure on red? You grab it. You
take a bite. You're going to lose one of those red

342
00:22:56,902 --> 00:23:02,006
die, but you are going to feel a little nauseous
about this whole process.

343
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:04,142
MARISHA: Well, I'm in a coffin.

344
00:23:04,142 --> 00:23:12,500
TALIESIN: You are in a coffin. I'm amused by the
throwing of the dice. All right.

345
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:16,339
TRAVIS: (groans)

346
00:23:16,339 --> 00:23:18,178
TALIESIN: Yeah, you got a second.

347
00:23:18,178 --> 00:23:20,940
MATT: I listen out to see if I hear anything.

348
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,376
TALIESIN: You hear someone claiming to be an
internet celebrity.

349
00:23:23,376 --> 00:23:29,934
MATT: I start going: Sam! Sam, it's me! It's
Matt!

350
00:23:29,934 --> 00:23:31,783
SAM: Matt, is that you?

351
00:23:31,783 --> 00:23:32,998
MATT: It's me!

352
00:23:32,998 --> 00:23:41,469
SAM: What has happened to us?! All I see is wood!
Have we gone inside Wyrmwood?

353
00:23:41,469 --> 00:23:46,849
TALIESIN: I feel like I should be able to bleed
you for that.

354
00:23:46,849 --> 00:23:52,516
LAURA: Is there any kind of lock? I have it open a
crack; I can't feel any?

355
00:23:52,516 --> 00:23:54,354
TALIESIN: There's no lock, no. It was just
sealed.

356
00:23:54,354 --> 00:23:56,355
LAURA: I want to shove it over to the side.

357
00:23:56,355 --> 00:24:02,321
LIAM: I'd like to rap a song with my knuckles on
the wood to try to get somebody's attention.

358
00:24:02,321 --> 00:24:05,107
TALIESIN: You're starting to hear that you're
obviously in a small group together.

359
00:24:05,107 --> 00:24:07,779
MARISAH: We can also sort of hear?

360
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,055
MATT: Sam!

361
00:24:09,055 --> 00:24:10,094
SAM: Matt!

362
00:24:10,094 --> 00:24:11,035
LAURA: Sam?

363
00:24:11,035 --> 00:24:11,921
MARISHA: Sam!

364
00:24:11,921 --> 00:24:12,878
LAURA: Matt?

365
00:24:12,878 --> 00:24:14,260
SAM: Marisha?

366
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,494
LAURA: Dad?

367
00:24:15,494 --> 00:24:19,654
TALIESIN: Rocky! You've managed to make your way
out.

368
00:24:19,654 --> 00:24:21,120
TRAVIS: I made it out first?

369
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,358
TALIESIN: You can crawl out.

370
00:24:22,358 --> 00:24:24,748
TRAVIS: Do I see anything?

371
00:24:24,748 --> 00:24:25,983
LAURA: Do you see my fingers?

372
00:24:25,983 --> 00:24:33,462
TALIESIN: You take a look and you're on a set.

373
00:24:33,462 --> 00:24:36,340
MARISHA: Okay! Max!

374
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:43,936
TRAVIS: (shushing) Guys! I'm outside the boxes!

375
00:24:43,936 --> 00:24:46,652
LAURA: Baby! Do you see my fingers?

376
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:54,173
TALIESIN: You don't see their fingers, but you do
see you're on a set. It looks pretty familiar. It

377
00:24:54,173 --> 00:24:56,202
might be the Nerdist set.

378
00:24:56,202 --> 00:24:57,784
TRAVIS: The fuck?

379
00:24:57,784 --> 00:25:00,140
LAURA: Did Nerdist turn us into vampires?

380
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,142
TALIESIN: Hasn't it turned us all into vampires?

381
00:25:02,142 --> 00:25:03,461
LIAM: Fucking Chobot.

382
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:12,604
TALIESIN: We'll get to that. The little light wall
is sparking and flickering. This place is even

383
00:25:12,604 --> 00:25:18,131
more trashed than normal. Someone went through
here. There's already a giant hole in the floor

384
00:25:18,131 --> 00:25:24,917
that's been blown through, and there are red X's
in a circle and you've come out of one of them.

385
00:25:24,917 --> 00:25:31,680
You can see some of the wood has started to give a
little bit and you can hear the tapping coming

386
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,248
from the ground.

387
00:25:33,248 --> 00:25:34,856
TRAVIS: Sam! Quit yelling like a little bitch!

388
00:25:34,856 --> 00:25:38,135
LAURA: Travis! I start pounding on the wood.
Travis!

389
00:25:38,181 --> 00:25:40,484
TRAVIS: Can I find my way to-- Is that Liam?

390
00:25:40,484 --> 00:25:41,812
LIAM: Yeah!

391
00:25:41,812 --> 00:25:45,147
TRAVIS: Okay, sit tight. Can I find my way to
Laura's sound?

392
00:25:45,147 --> 00:25:46,356
LAURA: Baby!

393
00:25:46,356 --> 00:25:47,250
TALIESIN: Yeah.

394
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,659
LAURA: Baby! Help!

395
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:49,769
SAM: Oh yeah, you're married.

396
00:25:49,769 --> 00:25:54,900
TRAVIS: You guys are fucked. Can I try and smash
through the floor?

397
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,265
TALIESIN: Sure, give me a strength brawl.

398
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:03,142
TRAVIS: Strength brawl? You are so kind! Give me
one more of these things.

399
00:26:03,142 --> 00:26:04,424
SAM: Wow!

400
00:26:04,424 --> 00:26:06,989
TRAVIS: Damn.

401
00:26:06,989 --> 00:26:09,392
LAURA: There better be a lot of successes in
there.

402
00:26:09,392 --> 00:26:15,010
TRAVIS: There are. There are five successes and
two failures. None on red.

403
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:22,611
TALIESIN: All right. Yeah. Practically like Bruce
Lee, you punch down and the floor splinters open

404
00:26:22,611 --> 00:26:28,704
and there's Laura Bailey with blood all over her
face.

405
00:26:28,704 --> 00:26:29,797
LAURA: Oh!

406
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:32,061
TRAVIS: Oh! Shit!

407
00:26:32,061 --> 00:26:33,642
LAURA: I ate a rat, baby!

408
00:26:33,642 --> 00:26:35,202
TRAVIS: You did what?!

409
00:26:35,202 --> 00:26:36,404
LAURA: I ate a rat!

410
00:26:36,404 --> 00:26:37,484
TRAVIS: You ate a rat?

411
00:26:37,484 --> 00:26:38,257
LAURA: Yeah!

412
00:26:38,257 --> 00:26:40,017
TRAVIS: It wasn't because I punched through
the floor?

413
00:26:40,017 --> 00:26:40,746
LAURA: No!

414
00:26:40,746 --> 00:26:43,588
TRAVIS: You could have lied and I wouldn't have
known that! Ugh, god!

415
00:26:43,588 --> 00:26:46,349
LAURA: I was really hungry! I'm sorry.

416
00:26:46,349 --> 00:26:48,662
TRAVIS: Is there any left?

417
00:26:48,662 --> 00:26:52,220
LAURA: Well, there's a little bit of rat left, but
it's just the butt.

418
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:56,221
TALIESIN: It's rat butt, man. Even a vampire has
some standards.

419
00:26:56,221 --> 00:27:00,210
LIAM: Can somebody get me out of wherever the fuck
it is I am?

420
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:04,394
TRAVIS: Quick note: we could get out of here and
leave everybody else.

421
00:27:04,394 --> 00:27:05,650
LAURA: We can't do that!

422
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:06,949
LIAM: I can hear you, dick!

423
00:27:06,949 --> 00:27:08,661
TALIESIN: You're making a lot of assumptions.

424
00:27:08,661 --> 00:27:11,101
TRAVIS: Let's get everyone else out.

425
00:27:11,101 --> 00:27:13,964
MARISHA: Now we all know how you feel about us.

426
00:27:13,964 --> 00:27:15,405
MATT: Sam!

427
00:27:15,405 --> 00:27:16,494
SAM: Matt!

428
00:27:16,494 --> 00:27:19,335
MATT: I'm here, Sam!

429
00:27:19,335 --> 00:27:20,974
SAM: I can hear you!

430
00:27:20,974 --> 00:27:23,117
TRAVIS: I'll go get Liam and Sam, you get Matt and
Marisha.

431
00:27:23,117 --> 00:27:25,238
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to try to open Matt and
Marisha.

432
00:27:25,238 --> 00:27:30,882
TALIESIN: Give me either strength brawl or
strength melee.

433
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:35,409
MATT: You can do this, Laura!

434
00:27:35,409 --> 00:27:36,974
LAURA: Thanks! I'll try!

435
00:27:36,974 --> 00:27:41,530
MARISHA: Let me know if you need help pushing!

436
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:43,484
LIAM: There's a rat in here with me.

437
00:27:43,484 --> 00:27:44,931
MARISHA: You should eat it!

438
00:27:44,931 --> 00:27:49,584
LAURA: Three successes, two failures. The success
was on the red.

439
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:54,363
TALIESIN: As long as there's no failure on the red,
it doesn't matter. You punch through quite easily.

440
00:27:54,363 --> 00:27:55,401
It goes all right.

441
00:27:55,401 --> 00:27:56,993
LAURA: Yeah! I'm getting her out first!

442
00:27:56,993 --> 00:27:58,730
LAURA and MARISHA: Yeah!

443
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:00,178
LAURA: Help me get Matt out.

444
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,081
MARISHA: Okay!

445
00:28:01,081 --> 00:28:01,959
LAURA: Matt!

446
00:28:01,959 --> 00:28:02,860
MATT: Sam!

447
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,985
SAM: Matt!

448
00:28:03,985 --> 00:28:06,484
MARISHA: I'm confused. Oh yeah, they're yelling
for each other.

449
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:09,490
LAURA: Look at all your lipstick on your--

450
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:12,862
MARISHA: I know! This is why you don't do this on
a daily basis.

451
00:28:12,862 --> 00:28:17,257
TRAVIS: On your X I rolled five successes and two
failures, but none on the red.

452
00:28:17,257 --> 00:28:24,044
TALIESIN: Yep, that does it. It doesn't go well,
but you get it open.

453
00:28:24,044 --> 00:28:25,767
LIAM: Ooh!

454
00:28:25,767 --> 00:28:27,787
TRAVIS: You okay?

455
00:28:27,787 --> 00:28:29,488
TALIESIN: Actually, five/two, that's fine.

456
00:28:29,488 --> 00:28:30,570
TRAVIS: You all right?

457
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:31,631
LIAM: Is my face okay?

458
00:28:31,631 --> 00:28:32,703
TRAVIS: It looks a little fucked up.

459
00:28:32,703 --> 00:28:33,789
LIAM: It feels weird.

460
00:28:33,789 --> 00:28:35,212
TRAVIS: We could leave right now.

461
00:28:35,212 --> 00:28:43,870
TALIESIN: Liam does not look healthy. He looks
almost like everything froze and cracked, like he

462
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:47,266
was wearing a plaster mask that started to go.

463
00:28:47,266 --> 00:28:48,500
LAURA: What the fuck happened to you?!

464
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,487
LIAM: What do you mean?

465
00:28:49,487 --> 00:28:51,150
LAURA: You look really weird.

466
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:52,801
LIAM: That makes me sad!

467
00:28:52,801 --> 00:28:56,125
TRAVIS: Don't worry about it. You know what? It's
the lighting in here; it's super low. Let's get

468
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:57,841
everybody else out first.

469
00:28:57,841 --> 00:28:59,122
LAURA: You should eat a rat.

470
00:28:59,122 --> 00:29:00,738
LIAM: The fuck are you talking about?!

471
00:29:00,738 --> 00:29:01,760
LAURA: I'm just saying.

472
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,784
MARISHA: It's real good.

473
00:29:02,784 --> 00:29:04,887
LAURA: Can we try to pry open Matt's coffin?

474
00:29:04,887 --> 00:29:05,958
SAM: Matt?

475
00:29:05,958 --> 00:29:07,494
MATT: Sam, is that you?

476
00:29:07,494 --> 00:29:09,336
TALIESIN: I would recommend leaving Sam, but
yeah.

477
00:29:09,336 --> 00:29:13,487
MARISHA: Okay, we double-team it.

478
00:29:13,487 --> 00:29:16,054
TALIESIN: You can roll together and we can add
all of your successes together.

479
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:17,779
MARISHA: Let's do that.

480
00:29:17,829 --> 00:29:20,500
TALIESIN: There's also a thing, I'm going to
remind you, you can do if you really don't like

481
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,859
your roll, although I would save this for later,
you can spend a willpower and reroll all the dice

482
00:29:23,859 --> 00:29:27,472
you don't like. But then your willpower goes
down.

483
00:29:27,472 --> 00:29:29,894
MARISHA: Ooh, I got a ten! Ooh, I got two tens!

484
00:29:29,894 --> 00:29:37,960
TALIESIN: Two tens. You hop over to Matt's
little X. Oh, failures?

485
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:42,260
MARISHA: One's an X-ed-out X. One on the red.

486
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:48,741
TALIESIN: So you walk over to Matt's little X and
you kick down real hard and you go straight

487
00:29:48,741 --> 00:29:52,854
through all the way down to the bottom. He's
fine!

488
00:29:52,854 --> 00:29:56,105
MATT: I spit bits of rat right up into your face.

489
00:29:56,105 --> 00:30:01,285
LAURA: I definitely also rolled a bunch of
failures with only one success and a failure was

490
00:30:01,285 --> 00:30:02,573
on the red.

491
00:30:02,573 --> 00:30:03,861
TALIESIN: Was it a <i>real</i> failure?

492
00:30:03,861 --> 00:30:04,826
LAURA: It's a four.

493
00:30:04,826 --> 00:30:06,287
TALIESIN: As long as it's not a one, it doesn't
matter.

494
00:30:06,287 --> 00:30:07,252
LAURA: Okay.

495
00:30:07,252 --> 00:30:08,981
SAM: A failure is a one.

496
00:30:08,981 --> 00:30:10,807
TALIESIN: A failure is a one on a <i>red die.</i>

497
00:30:10,807 --> 00:30:12,032
LIAM: And a success is--?

498
00:30:12,032 --> 00:30:13,383
TALIESIN: Six and above.

499
00:30:13,383 --> 00:30:16,431
LAURA: But a <i>failure</i> failure is a one.

500
00:30:16,431 --> 00:30:18,464
TALIESIN: Yeah, you don't have to worry about
anything other than--

501
00:30:18,464 --> 00:30:20,843
MARISHA: I'm so sorry, sweetheart.

502
00:30:20,843 --> 00:30:22,589
MATT: It's okay! Where's Sam?

503
00:30:22,589 --> 00:30:25,285
MARISHA: You look all right, though! I mean, you
look--

504
00:30:25,285 --> 00:30:26,719
TALIESIN: He looks all right.

505
00:30:26,719 --> 00:30:29,575
MARISHA: You look as bad as we do, but okay.

506
00:30:29,575 --> 00:30:31,903
MATT: Thank you for having Sam send you.

507
00:30:31,903 --> 00:30:35,230
TALIESIN: You guys look like maybe you've been
clubbing. You're a little pale.

508
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,595
TRAVIS: Sam?

509
00:30:36,595 --> 00:30:37,962
SAM: (shouting) Yeah?

510
00:30:37,962 --> 00:30:39,863
TRAVIS: Scream like a baby some more.

511
00:30:39,863 --> 00:30:41,283
SAM: (wailing)

512
00:30:41,283 --> 00:30:43,209
TRAVIS: Okay, cool. Can we find our way over to
the baby screams?

513
00:30:43,266 --> 00:30:47,526
TALIESIN: Yeah. Was going to say, yeah, pick which
baby, but yeah, no, that'll work.

514
00:30:47,526 --> 00:30:51,345
TRAVIS: Liam, you want to help me?

515
00:30:51,345 --> 00:30:53,311
LIAM: Yeah, of course. Sam, are you okay in
there?

516
00:30:53,311 --> 00:31:04,707
SAM: (shouting) I'm worried about my nanny! When I
was playing, I had a nanny watching the kids, I've

517
00:31:04,707 --> 00:31:06,839
got to get home to the kids!

518
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:08,062
TRAVIS: Is anybody wearing a watch?

519
00:31:08,062 --> 00:31:09,811
LAURA: Oh no, Charlie!

520
00:31:09,811 --> 00:31:11,490
LIAM: Do we have our iPhones on us?

521
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:13,618
TALIESIN: You do not have your phones on you.

522
00:31:13,618 --> 00:31:18,374
LIAM: I'm sure it's just a couple hours later.
We'll get you out of there and we'll figure it out.

523
00:31:18,374 --> 00:31:21,301
MARISHA: Can I go to the nearest surface and see
if there's a dust layer?

524
00:31:21,301 --> 00:31:24,959
TALIESIN: You want to actually take a look around,
maybe?

525
00:31:24,959 --> 00:31:26,210
MARISHA: I want to take a look around.

526
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:27,307
TRAVIS: Let's get Sam out first.

527
00:31:27,307 --> 00:31:29,394
MARISHA: While they get Sam out, I'm going to look
around.

528
00:31:29,394 --> 00:31:31,287
TALIESIN: Why don't you do a perception awareness
roll?

529
00:31:31,287 --> 00:31:35,504
TRAVIS: Strength and brawl is what he told me last
time.

530
00:31:35,504 --> 00:31:37,045
LIAM: And brawl? Here comes my two big dice.

531
00:31:37,045 --> 00:31:42,966
TRAVIS: I have one red fail, and one, two, three,
four successes.

532
00:31:42,966 --> 00:31:46,718
MARISHA: I've got a ten and a seven on the red
ones.

533
00:31:46,718 --> 00:31:55,160
TALIESIN: Man, you heard another rat rolling
around, and you're eyeing it.

534
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,461
TRAVIS: In the coffin? Or just on the floor?

535
00:31:57,461 --> 00:31:59,054
TALIESIN: Not everyone has eaten a rat yet.

536
00:31:59,054 --> 00:32:00,037
TRAVIS: Nope.

537
00:32:00,037 --> 00:32:02,348
TALIESIN: I think there's one more rat around, you
should go looking for that.

538
00:32:02,348 --> 00:32:04,199
TRAVIS: I'm going to go look for the sound of that
rat.

539
00:32:04,199 --> 00:32:05,514
LIAM: What are you doing?

540
00:32:05,514 --> 00:32:07,500
TRAVIS: I feel like I need a rat.

541
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:11,031
MARISHA: They're kind of refreshing. Don't judge, man.

542
00:32:11,031 --> 00:32:14,015
LIAM: I'm judging you hard. Real hard.

543
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,805
MARISHA: We are in a survival situation!

544
00:32:15,805 --> 00:32:20,210
LIAM: What? We're in the studio! I mean, it's a
little fucked up, but I rolled a ten and a seven,

545
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:21,577
did we get Sam out?

546
00:32:21,577 --> 00:32:23,757
TALIESIN: A ten and a seven? Yeah, that'll do it.

547
00:32:23,757 --> 00:32:26,312
MARISHA: You know there's not good crafty!

548
00:32:26,312 --> 00:32:28,686
LIAM: Sam! Husband, are you okay?

549
00:32:28,686 --> 00:32:34,689
SAM: I'm fine! Hey, that was a tough night, but
I'm sorry, are you okay?

550
00:32:34,689 --> 00:32:37,418
LIAM: It's a process.

551
00:32:37,418 --> 00:32:38,820
SAM: Okay.

552
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:44,698
LAURA: Oh, I'm sorry I told you that you look like
shit right after everything happened. I didn't

553
00:32:44,698 --> 00:32:45,749
think about it.

554
00:32:45,749 --> 00:32:47,178
LIAM: I'm used to that.

555
00:32:47,178 --> 00:32:50,016
TALIESIN: This is the most WB Vampire since the WB
Vampires.

556
00:32:50,016 --> 00:32:53,287
MATT: Yeah. Two successes to look around.

557
00:32:53,287 --> 00:33:06,254
TALIESIN: So there's no one here. And it's kind of
messed up. Oh, plus three. Something is wrong.

558
00:33:06,254 --> 00:33:12,673
Including a giant sign on the wall painted in
blood that says "Something is wrong."

559
00:33:12,673 --> 00:33:15,137
TRAVIS: Amazing.

560
00:33:15,137 --> 00:33:17,767
LAURA: Does it look like familiar handwriting?

561
00:33:17,767 --> 00:33:27,859
TALIESIN: No. To be fair, with the size of the
palette, it looks a little bit like

562
00:33:27,859 --> 00:33:29,253
fingerpainting.

563
00:33:29,253 --> 00:33:33,749
MARISHA: Does it look like it was deliberate, or
like it was part of the Thrashtopia set?

564
00:33:33,749 --> 00:33:38,626
TALIESIN: It's way too good-looking to be part of
the Thrashtopia set.

565
00:33:38,626 --> 00:33:40,114
MATT: So it's in Papyrus.

566
00:33:40,114 --> 00:33:47,533
MARISHA: You guys, someone took their time to tell
us that something is wrong.

567
00:33:47,533 --> 00:33:51,516
SAM: Of course something is wrong! Look at us! Do
we have fangs?

568
00:33:51,516 --> 00:33:52,882
TALIESIN: How would you know?

569
00:33:52,882 --> 00:33:54,545
SAM: I'm looking at them.

570
00:33:54,545 --> 00:34:00,209
TALIESIN: It's a little dark, Liam does not look
okay.

571
00:34:00,209 --> 00:34:01,845
MATT: I'm going to look for the lights.

572
00:34:01,845 --> 00:34:05,336
MARISHA: I'm going to go over to the green lights
and see if I can screw them in.

573
00:34:05,336 --> 00:34:11,114
TALIESIN: A bunch of them are broken. And it
looks like they've been smashed, all of the

574
00:34:11,114 --> 00:34:15,962
furniture, the table and the two chairs in that
section have been completely thrashed up and

575
00:34:15,962 --> 00:34:23,424
broken up. There's damage everywhere. It looks
like a riot came through here.

576
00:34:23,424 --> 00:34:28,040
LIAM: I'm going to drag my hand through the
writing on the wall, to make sure that it's fake

577
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,404
blood like syrup.

578
00:34:29,404 --> 00:34:32,495
TRAVIS: Like, maple syrup and chocolate syrup?

579
00:34:32,495 --> 00:34:34,377
LIAM: That's right, it's food, right?

580
00:34:34,377 --> 00:34:36,049
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's maple syrup.

581
00:34:36,049 --> 00:34:37,367
LIAM: Does it taste like maple syrup?

582
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:40,386
TALIESIN: It doesn't quite taste like maple syrup.
How much do you taste?

583
00:34:40,386 --> 00:34:43,755
LIAM: (lip smacking) Just my fingers, three
fingers.

584
00:34:43,755 --> 00:34:46,259
LAURA: Stop sticking your fingers in your mouth!

585
00:34:46,259 --> 00:34:52,550
TALIESIN: Try again? Give me one of your blood
tokens. It's not maple syrup, but it tastes better

586
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:58,088
than anything that you've ever experienced in your
entire life, you feel great.

587
00:34:58,088 --> 00:35:00,685
LIAM: Oh, I wipe a letter off the wall, and finish
that off then.

588
00:35:00,685 --> 00:35:01,907
TALIESIN: Just one. That's all you're getting.

589
00:35:01,907 --> 00:35:02,949
LIAM: Yeah, that's fine, that's fine.

590
00:35:02,949 --> 00:35:04,445
TRAVIS: What are you doing? Oh, sorry.

591
00:35:04,445 --> 00:35:07,865
TALIESIN: But you're hungry, you're all hungry.

592
00:35:07,865 --> 00:35:12,316
MATT: I'm going to slowly push open the door that
leads to the hallway just outside of the set.

593
00:35:12,316 --> 00:35:22,314
TALIESIN: So are you going to push towards the
Twitch studio, or push towards the hallway?

594
00:35:22,314 --> 00:35:24,765
MATT: Oh, sorry, closer to the Twitch studio.

595
00:35:24,765 --> 00:35:26,986
TALIESIN: Towards the Twitch studio.

596
00:35:26,986 --> 00:35:28,901
MARISHA: The big body doors? The big stage doors?

597
00:35:28,901 --> 00:35:36,271
TALIESIN: You sadly can't quite get to it because
there are piles of film memorabilia, there's a

598
00:35:36,271 --> 00:35:40,043
Power Ranger helmet, there's a Foosball table, it
is just--

599
00:35:40,043 --> 00:35:42,192
MARISHA: Grab that fucking helmet, it is worth
some money.

600
00:35:42,192 --> 00:35:43,758
TALIESIN: Not in the condition it's in!

601
00:35:43,758 --> 00:35:45,756
MATT: Based on her recommendation, I grab the
helmet and put it on.

602
00:35:45,756 --> 00:35:54,303
MARISHA: Can I bend down and see if there's any of
our stunt swords, or can I snap off a chair leg

603
00:35:54,303 --> 00:35:55,748
and arm myself?

604
00:35:55,748 --> 00:36:02,806
TALIESIN: You can snap off a chair leg, that's
okay, give me a strength athletics, I suppose. I'm

605
00:36:02,806 --> 00:36:04,138
still getting used to--

606
00:36:04,138 --> 00:36:05,544
TRAVIS: Can I keep looking for that rat?

607
00:36:05,544 --> 00:36:11,271
TALIESIN: Yeah, give me a perception awareness.
Oh, well, a perception investigation.

608
00:36:11,271 --> 00:36:12,592
TRAVIS: Damn it.

609
00:36:12,592 --> 00:36:13,633
MARISHA: Two successes?

610
00:36:13,633 --> 00:36:15,963
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, it snaps right off, you've got
a broken chair leg.

611
00:36:15,963 --> 00:36:21,586
SAM: Seeing Marisha do that, I'm going to find any
XLR cable on the floor I can find.

612
00:36:21,586 --> 00:36:24,107
TALIESIN: You don't even have to roll for 
that, it's everywhere.

613
00:36:24,107 --> 00:36:26,538
SAM: I'm going to use it as a whip if I need to.

614
00:36:26,538 --> 00:36:28,031
TALIESIN: That'll work great.

615
00:36:28,031 --> 00:36:29,885
TRAVIS: Three of three, including one crit.

616
00:36:29,885 --> 00:36:50,329
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, three and three including one crit?
Boy, do you find that rat. Suddenly--

617
00:36:50,329 --> 00:36:54,140
LAURA: Rats have paper?

618
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:56,220
TALIESIN: Rats are made of paper.

619
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,121
TRAVIS: Okay.

620
00:36:58,121 --> 00:37:00,054
TALIESIN: Which one did I hand you again?

621
00:37:00,054 --> 00:37:02,157
TRAVIS: Auspex, heightened awareness.

622
00:37:02,157 --> 00:37:08,645
TALIESIN: Boy, you <i>really</i> saw that rat, and you
got it.

623
00:37:08,645 --> 00:37:09,951
TRAVIS: I go right after it.

624
00:37:09,951 --> 00:37:13,755
TALIESIN: You catch it, and are you going to give
it a bite?

625
00:37:13,755 --> 00:37:15,764
TRAVIS: I'm going to give it a good little
(snarls).

626
00:37:15,764 --> 00:37:20,341
TALIESIN: Give me a die, and you're at one hunger.
By the way, your hunger level's however many

627
00:37:20,341 --> 00:37:23,116
red dice you have right now.

628
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:26,856
LAURA: There should be some stunt weapons--

629
00:37:26,856 --> 00:37:31,960
TALIESIN: Not on the Nerdist set, they're not that
cool. Sorry, I'm going to be throwing so much

630
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,623
shade, it's going to be really bad.

631
00:37:33,623 --> 00:37:36,673
LAURA: But there's a closet right outside of the
stage.

632
00:37:36,673 --> 00:37:39,196
TALIESIN: There are, but that door is not opening.
You're going to have to maybe--

633
00:37:39,196 --> 00:37:40,364
LAURA: Go to the hallway door?

634
00:37:40,364 --> 00:37:41,587
TALIESIN: You can check to see if it'll open.

635
00:37:41,587 --> 00:37:42,849
LAURA: I'm going to try and get into the hallway
door.

636
00:37:42,849 --> 00:37:43,647
TALIESIN: Are you going to be--

637
00:37:43,647 --> 00:37:45,073
LAURA: Stealthy about it?

638
00:37:45,073 --> 00:37:46,371
TALIESIN: Are you going to try and be stealthy
about it?

639
00:37:46,371 --> 00:37:49,964
LAURA: I'm going to try and be stealthy about
opening the door. Quietly.

640
00:37:49,964 --> 00:37:51,963
TALIESIN: Super stealthy. How quietly are you
going to open the door?

641
00:37:51,963 --> 00:38:02,299
LAURA: So quietly? Super quietly? I'm going to
take a really long time pushing that little bar in.

642
00:38:02,299 --> 00:38:06,213
TALIESIN: Yeah, give me a dex stealth.

643
00:38:06,213 --> 00:38:19,100
LAURA: Okay. Whoa! Double zeroes, crit. And all
successes. Everything was a success.

644
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,471
SAM: <i>All</i> successes?

645
00:38:20,471 --> 00:38:21,623
LAURA: Yeah!

646
00:38:21,623 --> 00:38:26,545
TALIESIN: You start to vanish as you're pushing
the door, you're get a little--

647
00:38:26,545 --> 00:38:30,471
MATT: Yes!

648
00:38:30,471 --> 00:38:35,723
LAURA: Oh my god. How do I use this, what do I do
with this?!

649
00:38:35,723 --> 00:38:38,234
TALIESIN: You let me know when you want to want to
use it, and I'll tell you what roll to make, but

650
00:38:38,234 --> 00:38:42,680
there are rules to it right now! You can try and
get fancy with it later, and it might get fancy,

651
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:46,668
but play around, see what works and what doesn't.
You don't know how this shit works.

652
00:38:46,668 --> 00:38:51,402
LAURA: Okay. So I can open the door.

653
00:38:51,402 --> 00:38:53,196
TALIESIN: You can open the door very quietly.

654
00:38:53,196 --> 00:38:55,024
LIAM: So, we're going to find a phone, we're going
to call your nanny. You and I will get out of

655
00:38:55,024 --> 00:38:57,395
here, we'll get to your place, we'll get you home,
and then I'll go home.

656
00:38:57,395 --> 00:39:00,136
SAM: Sure, yeah. Amy must be worried.

657
00:39:00,136 --> 00:39:02,172
LIAM: I would assume.

658
00:39:02,172 --> 00:39:03,253
SAM: Yeah!

659
00:39:03,253 --> 00:39:09,858
TALIESIN: The lights in the hallway are
flickering. They're not working well. They've got

660
00:39:09,858 --> 00:39:13,408
that weird fluorescent crackle when things are
left to go to rot.

661
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:15,531
LAURA: Can we hear any voices at all?

662
00:39:15,531 --> 00:39:22,939
TALIESIN: You can hear the hum of the server room
right across from you. And some sort of squishy

663
00:39:22,939 --> 00:39:29,004
sound coming from the server room. There's some
sort of awful (squishy noises).

664
00:39:29,004 --> 00:39:32,344
LAURA: Oh, that's foul. I'm going to go check it
out.

665
00:39:32,344 --> 00:39:33,876
TRAVIS: Where'd Laura go?

666
00:39:33,876 --> 00:39:39,091
SAM: I don't know. Are you okay?

667
00:39:39,091 --> 00:39:43,537
TRAVIS: I feel funny. I'm really hungry.

668
00:39:43,537 --> 00:39:49,705
SAM: Ooh, maybe they have leftover, what did we
have, Greek?

669
00:39:49,705 --> 00:39:53,132
TRAVIS: Yeah, it was like breakfast pizza and
gyros?

670
00:39:53,132 --> 00:39:54,920
SAM: Oh, it was Chinese!

671
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,921
LAURA: Yeah, we had Chinese.

672
00:39:56,921 --> 00:39:58,980
SAM: Maybe they have some leftover Chinese.

673
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:02,136
MATT: While they're having this conversation, I
walk over in my Power Ranger helmet and follow

674
00:40:02,136 --> 00:40:05,855
behind Marisha and where Laura might be, because I
have no idea where she is.

675
00:40:05,855 --> 00:40:09,131
MARISHA: Oh, babe, we should look out for those
Warcraft props.

676
00:40:09,131 --> 00:40:11,105
MATT: Oh yeah!

677
00:40:11,105 --> 00:40:12,790
MARISHA: Those might also be worth some money.

678
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:15,581
TALIESIN: I literally have their location written
in my notes, that makes me so happy.

679
00:40:15,581 --> 00:40:16,692
MARISHA: Really?

680
00:40:16,692 --> 00:40:17,577
TALIESIN: Really.

681
00:40:17,577 --> 00:40:19,909
SAM: If we wanted to head to the kitchen, is that
the same direction they're going?

682
00:40:19,909 --> 00:40:20,814
LAURA: Yeah.

683
00:40:20,814 --> 00:40:23,108
TALIESIN: They're at least at the table, and
there's something happening in the server room.

684
00:40:23,108 --> 00:40:26,713
It's dark in the kitchen, but you can't quite tell
what's happening.

685
00:40:26,713 --> 00:40:30,200
MARISHA: Let's try and get to the kitchen.

686
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,442
LIAM: Where?

687
00:40:31,442 --> 00:40:33,059
LAURA: You don't want to check out the server
room?

688
00:40:33,059 --> 00:40:34,806
MARISHA: Well, we've got to go that way anyway.

689
00:40:34,806 --> 00:40:37,490
TALIESIN: Everyone roll a dex stealth.

690
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:39,190
LAURA: Do I have to roll dex stealth?

691
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:44,677
TALIESIN: Since you did so well, I'm going to let
you walk one through, although that's not quite

692
00:40:44,677 --> 00:40:45,692
how it works.

693
00:40:45,692 --> 00:40:46,890
LAURA: Oh, really? Should I do it?

694
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:47,877
TALIESIN: No, I'll let you go.

695
00:40:47,877 --> 00:40:48,960
LIAM: Crit!

696
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,763
MARISHA: Ooh, I got two tens! Same thing!

697
00:40:50,763 --> 00:40:53,640
LAURA: Oh you got two tens, he got two tens as
well!

698
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,184
TALIESIN: Two tens? All right!

699
00:40:55,184 --> 00:40:56,585
MARISHA: And the rest are successes.

700
00:40:56,585 --> 00:40:57,426
TRAVIS and MATT: Two successes.

701
00:40:57,426 --> 00:40:59,344
SAM: One success.

702
00:40:59,344 --> 00:41:01,787
TALIESIN: You guys make a little bit of noise,
and--

703
00:41:01,787 --> 00:41:04,099
SAM: Isn't a crit two tens?

704
00:41:04,099 --> 00:41:05,503
LAURA: A crit is two tens.

705
00:41:05,503 --> 00:41:13,833
TALIESIN: --there's noise, there are things. You
don't see anybody, but you can hear stuff moving

706
00:41:13,833 --> 00:41:14,777
around.

707
00:41:14,777 --> 00:41:17,795
MARISHA: It's probably Sean, he works so late.

708
00:41:17,795 --> 00:41:23,679
TALIESIN: So the big door, the big door for the
Twitch studio.

709
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:27,701
LAURA: You mean that door over there?

710
00:41:27,701 --> 00:41:31,401
TALIESIN: I mean, yes, as long as you're not
pointing in the game, because then you're pointing

711
00:41:31,401 --> 00:41:33,515
at the front, but if you're pointing at the table,
then yeah, that's the door.

712
00:41:33,515 --> 00:41:34,479
LAURA: Right.

713
00:41:34,479 --> 00:41:36,428
LIAM: No, she's Laura, she's not Laura. She's
Laura, not Laura.

714
00:41:36,428 --> 00:41:39,232
TALIESIN: I'm trying to find my points.

715
00:41:39,232 --> 00:41:42,629
(creepy ambient sound, repeating "Where are
you?")

716
00:41:42,629 --> 00:41:45,383
LAURA: "Where are you," did you hear that?!
Creepy! Ugh!

717
00:41:45,383 --> 00:41:51,527
TALIESIN: Yeah, there's some weird sounds coming
from everywhere, but there's a big, bloody sign

718
00:41:51,527 --> 00:41:54,064
written on the main door to the Twitch stage.

719
00:41:54,064 --> 00:41:56,571
MARISHA: Does it say, "Things are getting
creepy?"

720
00:41:56,571 --> 00:42:00,058
SAM: Does it say, "Is it Thursday yet?"

721
00:42:00,058 --> 00:42:06,362
TALIESIN: It says, "I was born in a box, how do I
end?" With a question mark.

722
00:42:06,362 --> 00:42:09,672
LAURA: Wait a minute, does that mean other people
came out of coffins, too?

723
00:42:09,672 --> 00:42:16,023
TALIESIN: And below it is a circle that's been
drawn in blood, and set into four corners. In one

724
00:42:16,023 --> 00:42:24,912
corner is a heart, in another corner there's a
face, in the other corner is a glowing sun, and in

725
00:42:24,912 --> 00:42:27,318
the other corner is a cross with a circle.

726
00:42:27,318 --> 00:42:30,919
MARISHA: It's a box?

727
00:42:30,919 --> 00:42:38,929
TALIESIN: It's a circle, cut in four. With a heart,
a head, a sun, and a cross.

728
00:42:38,929 --> 00:42:42,310
MATT: Where are the Warcraft weapons?

729
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:46,969
LAURA: Are they in the stock closet, in the closet
that's got the props?

730
00:42:46,969 --> 00:42:48,369
MARISHA: They might be in the prop closet.

731
00:42:48,369 --> 00:42:51,521
TALIESIN: Right, does anybody actually have a card
key that gives them access to the prop closet?

732
00:42:51,521 --> 00:42:52,569
TRAVIS: I don't.

733
00:42:52,569 --> 00:42:53,665
LAURA: I bet Marisha does!

734
00:42:53,665 --> 00:42:54,759
MARISHA: I do!

735
00:42:54,759 --> 00:42:56,009
TALIESIN: Where is it?

736
00:42:56,009 --> 00:43:01,246
MARISHA: It's on Sean's desk. I've got to get to
the desk, I've got to get to my office.

737
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:02,579
MATT: I'll come with you to the office.

738
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:03,690
MARISHA: Okay.

739
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:07,416
LIAM: Is it as we remember it, or is there debris
everywhere?

740
00:43:07,416 --> 00:43:12,053
TALIESIN: The Foosball table is missing, the couch
has been overturned.

741
00:43:12,053 --> 00:43:14,155
LAURA: Are there Lucky Charms in the cabinet?

742
00:43:14,155 --> 00:43:17,181
TALIESIN: There are in fact, for some strange
reason, Lucky Charms in the cabinet.

743
00:43:17,181 --> 00:43:18,598
LAURA: Can I try to eat some Lucky Charms?

744
00:43:18,598 --> 00:43:25,366
TALIESIN: You can, go ahead and have a handful.
They taste like rat droppings. You can still taste

745
00:43:25,366 --> 00:43:28,584
them. It's the worst thing ever.

746
00:43:28,584 --> 00:43:30,020
LAURA: Even the marshmallows?

747
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:34,861
TALIESIN: The marshmallows are like fuzzy bits of
lint inside of rat droppings, I'm so sorry. It

748
00:43:34,861 --> 00:43:36,059
doesn't taste right.

749
00:43:36,059 --> 00:43:37,509
TRAVIS: What's the matter with you, you love Lucky
Charms!

750
00:43:37,509 --> 00:43:39,661
LAURA: (sadly) I love Lucky Charms. These taste
like shit.

751
00:43:39,661 --> 00:43:40,713
TRAVIS: Are they old?

752
00:43:40,713 --> 00:43:42,121
LAURA: I don't think that's what it is.

753
00:43:42,121 --> 00:43:44,972
LIAM: You're crazy.

754
00:43:44,972 --> 00:43:47,901
LAURA: They taste like shit.

755
00:43:47,901 --> 00:43:50,808
LIAM: Ugh!

756
00:43:50,808 --> 00:43:52,635
MATT: Let's make our way to Sean's office.

757
00:43:52,635 --> 00:43:53,868
TALIESIN: Reroll stealth before you do.

758
00:43:53,868 --> 00:43:59,889
MATT: Okay. Trying to be careful as we go past the
server room glass window.

759
00:43:59,889 --> 00:44:04,665
MARISHA: What was it again? Dex and--?

760
00:44:04,665 --> 00:44:05,860
MATT: Stealth.

761
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:07,126
TALIESIN: Dex stealth.

762
00:44:07,126 --> 00:44:08,400
MATT: That's one success!

763
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,483
LAURA: Just one?

764
00:44:09,483 --> 00:44:11,130
MATT: Just one. I'm not very stealthy.

765
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:12,245
LAURA: Oh no!

766
00:44:12,245 --> 00:44:13,356
TALIESIN: Oh no.

767
00:44:13,356 --> 00:44:16,296
MARISHA: Double failures. On the red.

768
00:44:16,296 --> 00:44:20,523
LAURA: Everything else was a success though!

769
00:44:20,523 --> 00:44:21,662
LIAM: Doesn't matter!

770
00:44:21,662 --> 00:44:25,620
MARISHA: Yeah, everything else was real good!

771
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:31,532
LIAM: It's just like the end of the Vox Machina
story! Goodbye!

772
00:44:31,532 --> 00:44:34,028
TALIESIN: What's your current hunger?

773
00:44:34,028 --> 00:44:36,599
LAURA: She's got two dice.

774
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:43,091
MARISHA: Yeah, two, yeah. They both were ones. The
red ones were ones.

775
00:44:43,091 --> 00:44:51,253
TALIESIN: Yeah, your forehead starts to elongate a
little bit, and your eyes begin to glow, you start

776
00:44:51,253 --> 00:44:55,733
to kind of have a little bit of a twitch, and
you're getting a little feral.

777
00:44:55,733 --> 00:44:58,478
MARISHA: Do I see my reflection in the server room
window?

778
00:44:58,478 --> 00:45:01,527
TALIESIN: You <i>do</i> see your reflection in the
server room window. Are you looking in the server

779
00:45:01,527 --> 00:45:02,675
room window?

780
00:45:02,675 --> 00:45:03,593
MARISHA: Yeah.

781
00:45:03,593 --> 00:45:04,990
TALIESIN: That's not a server.

782
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:07,889
MARISHA: What do you mean that's not--? What?

783
00:45:07,889 --> 00:45:13,862
TALIESIN: Whatever's in the server room, it
doesn't quite look like a server.

784
00:45:13,862 --> 00:45:16,697
MARISHA: Does it still look like a big, fatty
computer?

785
00:45:16,697 --> 00:45:19,263
TALIESIN: If they made them out of meat.

786
00:45:19,263 --> 00:45:23,060
MATT, TALIESIN, and MARISHA: Meat computer.

787
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:26,598
LAURA: Gross!

788
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:28,824
MATT: It's probably MSI.

789
00:45:28,824 --> 00:45:37,242
TALIESIN: Normally I wouldn't do this on this, but
it's amusing me. So even though this was a

790
00:45:37,242 --> 00:45:45,326
failure, I figure I may as well hit that now since
you started to change. The server is pulsating and

791
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:50,681
thwapping against the window like it's trying to
get out.

792
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:55,413
MATT: Do we see any discernable features beyond
being a mass of flesh?

793
00:45:55,413 --> 00:45:59,056
TALIESIN: How close to the window--? Make a
perception roll into the window.

794
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:04,515
MATT: We're trying to say on the other side of the
hallway as we creep by. Just perception?

795
00:46:04,515 --> 00:46:10,391
TALIESIN: You can do perception investigation, if
you like, or perception awareness.

796
00:46:10,391 --> 00:46:18,698
MATT: Three successes and one failure on the red
die.

797
00:46:18,698 --> 00:46:23,014
TALIESIN: One failure on the red die? You are
suddenly panicked when you realize-- you get

798
00:46:23,014 --> 00:46:26,908
distracted for looking in the room when you realize
that you can see Marisha's reflection, but you

799
00:46:26,908 --> 00:46:28,403
don't see yours.

800
00:46:28,403 --> 00:46:30,513
MATT: I know what this means!

801
00:46:30,513 --> 00:46:34,533
MARISHA: Babe! This is some Buffy shit!

802
00:46:34,533 --> 00:46:36,200
MATT: It's pretty fucking cool.

803
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,911
MARISHA: Look how awesome! Do I look cool?

804
00:46:37,911 --> 00:46:42,931
MATT: Pretty badass. I got to take a picture, but
I see my phone's not there. I'm like: Oh shit, sorry.

805
00:46:42,931 --> 00:46:48,986
TALIESIN: Suddenly, the door to the server room
bursts open.

806
00:46:48,986 --> 00:46:51,903
LAURA: Do we hear it in the kitchen?

807
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:53,454
TALIESIN: It flies open.

808
00:46:53,454 --> 00:46:55,646
LAURA: Oh shit! I go running to see what the noise
is.

809
00:46:55,646 --> 00:47:00,578
TALIESIN: As you stop, you see Dani Carr.

810
00:47:00,578 --> 00:47:01,660
LIAM: No!

811
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:02,624
MARISHA: Dani!

812
00:47:02,624 --> 00:47:09,845
TALIESIN: With a big smile on her face. A very big
smile on the face. And a tea set! And she ignores

813
00:47:09,845 --> 00:47:16,583
you and takes the tea over into the Geek &amp; Sundry
bullpen, humming a little tune as the door shuts

814
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:19,060
behind her with whatever's writhing and wriggling
in there.

815
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:21,266
MARISHA: Wait, did she us?

816
00:47:21,266 --> 00:47:24,546
TALIESIN: She didn't seem to acknowledge you.

817
00:47:24,546 --> 00:47:27,752
LIAM: She came out of the server room and went
into Nerdist?

818
00:47:27,752 --> 00:47:37,856
TALIESIN: She looked a little gaunt, definitely,
but her eyes had sunken in a little bit and her

819
00:47:37,856 --> 00:47:46,220
skin was a little too tight for her skull.
Everything looked a little thinned and darkened.

820
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:49,748
MATT: Marisha, I think we're all fucked up.

821
00:47:49,748 --> 00:47:53,388
LAURA: What the fuck happened to Marisha's face?

822
00:47:53,388 --> 00:47:55,253
MARISHA: Look, isn't it awesome?

823
00:47:55,253 --> 00:48:01,145
TALIESIN: To the bullpen. To the Geek &amp; Sundry
bullpen to Marisha and Sean's office in the back.

824
00:48:01,145 --> 00:48:02,697
LIAM: I'm going to follow her. Dani!

825
00:48:02,697 --> 00:48:05,293
TALIESIN: How close are you going to get?

826
00:48:05,293 --> 00:48:07,702
MARISHA: I've got to get the key card, so I'll go
with you.

827
00:48:07,702 --> 00:48:09,335
LIAM: 30 feet behind. D?

828
00:48:09,335 --> 00:48:10,799
MARISHA: Continuing my mission.

829
00:48:10,799 --> 00:48:12,169
LIAM: Dani?

830
00:48:12,169 --> 00:48:23,788
TALIESIN: She's ignoring. She takes the tea set,
if you can look around, into Sean's office,

831
00:48:23,788 --> 00:48:28,636
humming the whole time. The door shuts behind her.
You couldn't get a good look at what's going on.

832
00:48:28,636 --> 00:48:30,296
The lights, again, are all a little iffy.

833
00:48:30,296 --> 00:48:32,533
MARISHA: We've never fucking drank tea.

834
00:48:32,533 --> 00:48:38,889
TALIESIN: If you're crawling in that direction,
you can definitely start taking a look around and

835
00:48:38,889 --> 00:48:44,019
see what's up there as I find my bullpen.

836
00:48:44,019 --> 00:48:47,161
LIAM: I don't remember exactly what's in the
Nerdist offices, but it's full of shit. Is there

837
00:48:47,161 --> 00:48:48,643
anything I could grab as a weapon?

838
00:48:48,643 --> 00:48:52,218
TALIESIN: Other than a commemorative Chun Li
statue.

839
00:48:52,218 --> 00:48:53,998
LIAM: I'm taking it.

840
00:48:53,998 --> 00:48:55,363
MARISHA and LAURA: Those are heavy!

841
00:48:55,363 --> 00:48:59,532
MATT: Can I look for social's, Chris' sword that
he always attacks people with?

842
00:48:59,532 --> 00:49:00,705
TALIESIN: The foam one?

843
00:49:00,705 --> 00:49:01,532
MATT: The foam one.

844
00:49:01,532 --> 00:49:03,120
TALIESIN: Are you going into the Geek &amp; Sundry
bullpen?

845
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,096
MATT: To look for that, yes.

846
00:49:04,096 --> 00:49:05,525
TALIESIN: Chris is in the bullpen.

847
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:07,553
MATT: I go: Chris, give me your foam sword!

848
00:49:07,553 --> 00:49:16,382
TALIESIN: Chris is ignoring you. Chris is sitting
at his desk and his eyes have sunken all the way

849
00:49:16,382 --> 00:49:23,417
almost into the back of his head. His mouth is
very terse and he's wearing a sign and he's

850
00:49:23,417 --> 00:49:29,530
working on the socials. You also see that the
window has been blocked and covered.

851
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:33,132
LAURA: Do they look like us, or do they look
like--?

852
00:49:33,132 --> 00:49:40,205
TALIESIN: They look like people wearing some weird
makeup who are very dehydrated and they're all

853
00:49:40,205 --> 00:49:43,211
wearing signs around their neck and really trying
hard--

854
00:49:43,211 --> 00:49:44,520
LAURA: Signs around their neck?

855
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:48,136
TALIESIN: Are you going in enough to see it?

856
00:49:48,136 --> 00:49:51,866
MATT: Yeah! I was going to go bug him and: Chris!
What's wrong with you?

857
00:49:51,866 --> 00:50:01,517
TALIESIN: As far as you can see so far,
between Chris, Sax, Arcade, and Audrey, they are

858
00:50:01,517 --> 00:50:05,580
all occasionally making eye contact with you, but
not really keeping it, and they're all wearing

859
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:07,056
signs that say "Drink Me."

860
00:50:07,056 --> 00:50:09,658
SAM and LAURA: Ugh.

861
00:50:09,658 --> 00:50:17,893
TALIESIN: They are terrified. Is anybody above a
hunger three right now? Three or above? Do you

862
00:50:17,893 --> 00:50:20,402
have three red dice, or is everybody at least at
two?

863
00:50:20,402 --> 00:50:21,766
MATT, LAURA, and TRAVIS: One.

864
00:50:21,766 --> 00:50:22,787
SAM and MARISHA: Two.

865
00:50:22,787 --> 00:50:38,265
TALIESIN: They smell weirdly good. There's an
almost candied sensation.

866
00:50:38,265 --> 00:50:40,371
LAURA: Do they smell like Lucky Charms?

867
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:48,767
TALIESIN: They smell like the first bowl of Lucky
Charms you ever had in your life. They are all

868
00:50:48,767 --> 00:50:54,340
sitting at their desks, either working or
pretending to work, it's hard to tell. Dani comes

869
00:50:54,340 --> 00:51:01,259
bursting out of the office without a tea tray,
sits down at her desk and meets your gaze.

870
00:51:01,259 --> 00:51:04,596
TRAVIS: Who did she deliver tea to?

871
00:51:04,596 --> 00:51:06,396
LIAM: Dani?

872
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:08,018
TALIESIN: "Yeah?"

873
00:51:08,018 --> 00:51:09,245
LIAM: What's going on?

874
00:51:09,245 --> 00:51:12,735
TALIESIN: "Oh, you're all awake! That's great."

875
00:51:12,735 --> 00:51:16,870
MARISHA: Dani. Sean doesn't drink tea.

876
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:20,091
TALIESIN: "Sean doesn't drink tea, that's true."

877
00:51:20,091 --> 00:51:21,549
MARISHA: Is Sean in there?

878
00:51:21,549 --> 00:51:23,541
TALIESIN: "No. No, Sean's working on the server."

879
00:51:23,541 --> 00:51:28,498
LAURA: Ugh. How long were we sleeping?

880
00:51:28,498 --> 00:51:36,572
TALIESIN: "Who can say? That's just a matter of
opinion, that could be anything. I'd have to ask

881
00:51:36,572 --> 00:51:37,857
"upstairs. I could write an email!"

882
00:51:37,857 --> 00:51:39,510
LIAM: Do you know what's going on?

883
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:44,885
TALIESIN: "Of course! Of course I know what's
going on; that's my job. I know what's going on."

884
00:51:44,885 --> 00:51:47,393
LAURA: Why were we in the coffins?

885
00:51:47,393 --> 00:51:51,857
TALIESIN: "I don't understand the question. That's
odd."

886
00:51:51,857 --> 00:51:53,818
TRAVIS: Who did you give the tea to?

887
00:51:53,818 --> 00:51:55,850
TALIESIN: "Oh, they're having a creative meeting
right now."

888
00:51:55,850 --> 00:51:57,279
SAM: Who's they?

889
00:51:57,279 --> 00:51:58,573
TALIESIN: "The creative team."

890
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:00,957
MARISHA: Why the fuck didn't I get an email?!

891
00:52:00,957 --> 00:52:03,442
LAURA: You were in a coffin, dude, you might have
gotten an email.

892
00:52:03,442 --> 00:52:06,625
LIAM: Is this a Geek &amp; Sundry thing or an LDN
thing?

893
00:52:06,625 --> 00:52:11,534
TALIESIN: This is most assuredly an LDN thing.

894
00:52:11,534 --> 00:52:15,056
(laughter)

895
00:52:15,056 --> 00:52:21,524
TALIESIN: "Well, ask me no more questions, and
I'll tell you no more lies!"

896
00:52:21,524 --> 00:52:26,453
TRAVIS: Can I make my way out of the bullpen, back
towards the server room?

897
00:52:26,453 --> 00:52:28,158
TALIESIN: Yeah.

898
00:52:28,158 --> 00:52:31,144
TRAVIS: Can I approach the server room window?

899
00:52:31,144 --> 00:52:32,327
TALIESIN: Yeah.

900
00:52:32,327 --> 00:52:34,019
TRAVIS: Can I look inside?

901
00:52:34,019 --> 00:52:43,602
TALIESIN: Yeah. Give me a perception investigation
because you don't have an awareness issue.

902
00:52:43,602 --> 00:52:49,556
TRAVIS: Oh god. Three successes.

903
00:52:49,556 --> 00:53:02,460
TALIESIN: That thing in there is definitely meat
and it's some sort of weird-- it's built out of a

904
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:09,300
lot of different things and it seems to be
interconnected to something that goes up higher

905
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:13,447
into the building. It's part of some sort of
machine.

906
00:53:13,447 --> 00:53:15,749
TRAVIS: Do I smell anything?

907
00:53:15,749 --> 00:53:20,083
TALIESIN: It smells kind of good. Not great, but
it smells pretty good.

908
00:53:20,083 --> 00:53:21,333
TRAVIS: Okay.

909
00:53:21,333 --> 00:53:23,573
TALIESIN: But it's locked.

910
00:53:23,573 --> 00:53:25,489
TRAVIS: I don't see Sean anywhere?

911
00:53:25,489 --> 00:53:32,300
TALIESIN: Not that you can tell. How well and
intimately do you know Sean? Could you recognize

912
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:39,514
him by just parts? You don't see his head
anywhere, I'll go that far.

913
00:53:39,514 --> 00:53:42,669
LIAM: You've seen his head.

914
00:53:42,669 --> 00:53:44,588
TALIESIN: Man, I warned y'all.

915
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:47,875
TRAVIS: Yeah, I know!

916
00:53:47,875 --> 00:53:50,928
MATT: Is this an amalgamation of many parts, or it
one giant, pulsating Tetsuo type thing?

917
00:53:50,928 --> 00:53:54,717
LAURA: I know, I was picturing a big flesh blob,
but it's body parts?

918
00:53:54,717 --> 00:53:59,945
TALIESIN: Yeah, if you look really closely you
tell that there's parts that were not ground up

919
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:01,451
appropriately and are definitely--

920
00:54:01,451 --> 00:54:02,508
LAURA: Ground up?!

921
00:54:02,508 --> 00:54:08,892
MATT: Chris, give your sword! I shake him. Give me
your sword!

922
00:54:08,892 --> 00:54:12,947
TALIESIN: Chris is frozen with fear.

923
00:54:12,947 --> 00:54:14,660
MATT: I look around for the sword.

924
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:16,446
TALIESIN: There is a foam sword by his--

925
00:54:16,446 --> 00:54:18,051
MATT: I take it!

926
00:54:18,051 --> 00:54:22,512
TALIESIN: He almost tells you not to take it, and then
thinks better of it when Dani looks at him.

927
00:54:22,512 --> 00:54:28,160
LIAM: I set Chun Li down on Dani's desk. Dani,
we're going to get the fuck out of here, and we're

928
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:31,640
going to take you with us. You need to tell me
what the fuck is going on so we can work together

929
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:32,849
to get the fuck out!

930
00:54:32,849 --> 00:54:36,615
TALIESIN: "We won't know what's going on until the
creative meeting is over. You would have to talk

931
00:54:36,615 --> 00:54:37,543
"to them."

932
00:54:37,543 --> 00:54:38,768
LIAM: You are talking like a crazy person!

933
00:54:38,768 --> 00:54:40,443
MARISHA: I'm going to go in the creative meeting.

934
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:41,557
TALIESIN: Yay!

935
00:54:41,557 --> 00:54:45,675
MARISHA: They're in my office.

936
00:54:45,675 --> 00:54:47,138
MATT: It's true.

937
00:54:47,138 --> 00:54:52,280
TRAVIS: There's no writing or sign on the door
that says, "Drive-Thru"?

938
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:56,949
TALIESIN: You go into the creative meeting?

939
00:54:56,949 --> 00:54:58,301
MARISHA: Yeah.

940
00:54:58,301 --> 00:55:00,348
TALIESIN: You walk in.

941
00:55:00,348 --> 00:55:02,391
LIAM: Fuck it. I pick up Chun Li and I back her
up.

942
00:55:02,391 --> 00:55:13,176
TALIESIN: Inside are Eric, and I think it's Matt
Key. Eric's sitting on the little green grass

943
00:55:13,176 --> 00:55:20,864
carpet. They've got the tea set out. There's a
couple different tea cups and he's sitting there

944
00:55:20,864 --> 00:55:29,698
having a sip of tea. Weirdly, Whitney Moore is
sitting there with him.

945
00:55:29,698 --> 00:55:33,621
LIAM: Does it look normal in here? They're not,
but the room?

946
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:41,132
TALIESIN: They look normal, except their eyes.
There's large black circles around their eyes and

947
00:55:41,193 --> 00:55:49,289
their mouths are blackened over in this very weird
gray puffy mold. It's almost like there's a mold

948
00:55:49,289 --> 00:55:56,151
around their mouths and eyes. In the corner is
Matt Key, who is working on an iPad, but it's only

949
00:55:56,151 --> 00:56:08,483
the arm and the head of Matt Key. He seems to have
sprouted spores. There's an old, flowering pile of

950
00:56:08,483 --> 00:56:14,410
gray mushrooms that still have Matt Key's face and
hand as he's working in the corner that has

951
00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:23,541
crawled up and covered the window. Eric and
Whitney see you come in and go, "Oh thank god,

952
00:56:23,541 --> 00:56:31,281
"Marisha, we've been waiting. It has been very
weird. Come down, have some tea, it's just what

953
00:56:31,281 --> 00:56:34,170
"you need." As they sit and drink tea.

954
00:56:34,170 --> 00:56:38,386
SAM: Are there any telephones around, Taliesin?

955
00:56:38,386 --> 00:56:40,676
TALIESIN: Have you ever seen a telephone in this
place?

956
00:56:40,676 --> 00:56:42,242
LAURA: Where's Taliesin?

957
00:56:42,242 --> 00:56:48,719
TALIESIN: There was an extra hole in the ground
and I was already broken open. That's all I'm

958
00:56:48,719 --> 00:56:59,879
going to say. They're giggling a lot and they're
talking about "Dad." "Dad's coming back any second

959
00:56:59,879 --> 00:57:05,649
"now. Dad has plans. Have some tea. We'll explain
everything."

960
00:57:05,649 --> 00:57:07,610
SAM: Don't have the tea.

961
00:57:07,610 --> 00:57:11,801
MARISHA: Is this a coup? Is Taliesin taking over?
What did Taliesin do?

962
00:57:11,801 --> 00:57:13,172
SAM: Where's Taliesin?

963
00:57:13,172 --> 00:57:14,232
LAURA: There was a hole.

964
00:57:14,232 --> 00:57:19,305
TALIESIN: "Taliesin was here. Taliesin left. He
went to go deal with something. But Taliesin was here."

965
00:57:19,305 --> 00:57:20,599
SAM: Which way did he go?

966
00:57:20,599 --> 00:57:21,695
TALIESIN: "Out."

967
00:57:21,695 --> 00:57:27,490
LAURA: Outside? Should we leave? Let's leave.

968
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:28,754
SAM: Yeah!

969
00:57:28,754 --> 00:57:29,930
LAURA: I'm going to walk towards the front door.

970
00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:31,077
SAM: I'm joining Laura.

971
00:57:31,077 --> 00:57:32,432
TALIESIN: You're going to walk towards the front
door?

972
00:57:32,432 --> 00:57:33,520
LAURA and SAM: Yeah.

973
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:38,567
MATT: Before they do that, because I saw my lack
of a reflection. Is it day or night outside?

974
00:57:38,567 --> 00:57:41,124
TALIESIN: You don't know. You actually haven't
seen a working window yet.

975
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,438
MATT: They're all blocked?

976
00:57:42,438 --> 00:57:43,771
TALIESIN: So far!

977
00:57:43,771 --> 00:57:52,233
MATT: I'm going to say: Hey! Be careful! Be slow.
Some of us might be sensitive to sunlight.

978
00:57:52,233 --> 00:57:53,781
SAM: Oh.

979
00:57:53,853 --> 00:57:59,223
MATT: I point. Marisha's probably still back in
the office. You saw Marisha's face?!

980
00:57:59,223 --> 00:58:05,636
TALIESIN: Eric and Whitney see you do this and
laugh their ass off. And then, "Key! Key! Put that

981
00:58:05,636 --> 00:58:10,816
"in, put that in, that's great! That's great! Aw,
Matt! Matt! Genius! No, we're going to use that!"

982
00:58:10,816 --> 00:58:14,751
MATT: I never get this kind of positive feedback,
I'm actually liking this.

983
00:58:14,751 --> 00:58:17,286
LAURA: Yeah, right.

984
00:58:17,286 --> 00:58:19,380
LIAM: Key. Key, buddy. You doing all right?

985
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:25,994
TALIESIN: Key has a smile and he's writing
everything down. He's just iPad-ing, "Key. Key,

986
00:58:25,994 --> 00:58:27,260
"buddy. You doing all right?"

987
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:31,191
MARISHA: I'm going to go look over Key's shoulder,
look at his iPad. Scroll up.

988
00:58:31,191 --> 00:58:46,814
TALIESIN: Roll a straight dexterity roll.
Dexterity dodge. Let's get weird.

989
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:56,585
MARISHA: Sure! All successes except for one.

990
00:58:56,585 --> 00:59:01,773
TALIESIN: All successes except for one? He's been
writing down everything the two of them have said.

991
00:59:01,773 --> 00:59:05,827
MARISHA: Is there anything that we have said
further up in the document?

992
00:59:05,827 --> 00:59:08,412
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, it's all there. He's taken down
every note of everything he can hear.

993
00:59:08,412 --> 00:59:09,931
MARISHA: Including when we weren't in the room?

994
00:59:09,931 --> 00:59:12,202
TALIESIN: No. It's a creative meeting.

995
00:59:12,202 --> 00:59:13,524
MARISHA: Right.

996
00:59:13,524 --> 00:59:18,708
LIAM: Key. Buddy. I voice Doctor Strange. You love
Doctor Strange! Key!

997
00:59:18,708 --> 00:59:21,215
TALIESIN: He writes, "I voice Doctor Strange. I
love Doctor Strange. Key!"

998
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:25,351
LIAM: Can I poke his face a little bit?

999
00:59:25,351 --> 00:59:28,122
TALIESIN: It's gray and weird looking.

1000
00:59:28,122 --> 00:59:30,077
LIAM: I'm going to poke it.

1001
00:59:30,077 --> 00:59:39,283
TALIESIN: All right. Roll stanima.

1002
00:59:39,283 --> 00:59:44,057
LAURA, MARISHA, and MATT: Stanima?

1003
00:59:44,057 --> 00:59:50,805
TALIESIN: Stamina. Roll stanima. What am I going
to add to that? Just roll stanima--

1004
00:59:50,805 --> 00:59:52,296
LIAM: Oh shite.

1005
00:59:52,296 --> 00:59:53,846
SAM: I think he thinks it's "stanima"!

1006
00:59:53,846 --> 00:59:55,596
TALIESIN: I can't say it right, I know.

1007
00:59:55,596 --> 00:59:58,070
LIAM: It's a lot of pressure behind that screen,
man.

1008
00:59:58,070 --> 01:00:09,659
LIAM: Not on the red one, but the non-red is a
failure-- Two failures, and the red one is a

1009
01:00:09,659 --> 01:00:10,943
success.

1010
01:00:10,943 --> 01:00:12,715
TALIESIN: So just a failure on the one--

1011
01:00:12,715 --> 01:00:14,204
LIAM: Failure on the non-reds.

1012
01:00:14,204 --> 01:00:21,063
TALIESIN: Okay, but a success on the reds.
Nothing. This is going to sound weird, roll

1013
01:00:21,063 --> 01:00:22,535
charisma persuasion.

1014
01:00:22,535 --> 01:00:32,947
LIAM: Charisma and persuasion. Yes. Yas, Key.
Where the frig is persuasion? Where is it? There

1015
01:00:32,947 --> 01:00:34,145
it is.

1016
01:00:34,145 --> 01:00:37,535
TALIESIN: There's still tea.

1017
01:00:37,535 --> 01:00:44,707
LIAM: Four failures, the red is a nine, and a
non-red success.

1018
01:00:44,707 --> 01:00:48,252
TALIESIN: It doesn't matter where a failure is,
just tell me the number of successes.

1019
01:00:48,252 --> 01:00:50,475
LIAM: Two successes, one of which is on a red.

1020
01:00:50,475 --> 01:00:55,660
TALIESIN: Okay, and the other red didn't hit a
one? It doesn't matter failures, it's just

1021
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:56,658
successes.

1022
01:00:56,658 --> 01:00:57,824
LIAM: I only have one red die, though.

1023
01:00:57,824 --> 01:01:04,758
TALIESIN: So it's fine. So two successes.
Actually, hold on. That's right, I can do this.

1024
01:01:04,758 --> 01:01:06,685
I've got a thing for this.

1025
01:01:06,685 --> 01:01:08,243
LIAM: And I smell my finger.

1026
01:01:08,243 --> 01:01:13,037
LAURA: Gross. Why are you licking and smelling
your fingers?

1027
01:01:13,037 --> 01:01:14,951
LIAM: You've known me for so long.

1028
01:01:14,951 --> 01:01:16,471
LAURA: You've got a piece of paper.

1029
01:01:16,471 --> 01:01:17,670
LIAM: What is it?

1030
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:23,974
LAURA: What is it?

1031
01:01:23,974 --> 01:01:32,954
TALIESIN: Key actually twitches and you hear this
snap of a whole bunch of mushrooms and spores as

1032
01:01:32,954 --> 01:01:35,663
his neck (clicks). There's a little puff.

1033
01:01:35,663 --> 01:01:40,881
MARISHA: Does the spore puff do anything?

1034
01:01:40,881 --> 01:01:44,194
TALIESIN: Were you close enough to sniff it?

1035
01:01:44,194 --> 01:01:46,184
MARISHA: I was leaning over his shoulder.

1036
01:01:46,184 --> 01:01:47,656
LAURA: Oh shit, you were.

1037
01:01:47,656 --> 01:01:52,093
TALIESIN: "We're going to add that in. It's going
to be great."

1038
01:01:52,093 --> 01:01:58,922
LIAM: Are you aware this is not a normal situation
right now?

1039
01:01:58,922 --> 01:02:04,032
TALIESIN: "Oh yeah, we have Alpha money. We've
never had this kind of money before. They're

1040
01:02:04,032 --> 01:02:11,852
"letting us do so much." Did you sniff the snorts?
Spores. (mispronouncing) Sniff the spores? Sniff

1041
01:02:11,852 --> 01:02:12,822
the s'mores?

1042
01:02:12,822 --> 01:02:14,238
MARISHA: I don't know, did I sniff the spores?

1043
01:02:14,238 --> 01:02:19,578
TALIESIN: There were s'mores, but-- Roll stanima,
just tell me what happens.

1044
01:02:19,578 --> 01:02:30,943
MARISHA: Stanima? I've got to think about it now.
Just straight stanima?

1045
01:02:30,943 --> 01:02:32,809
TALIESIN: Feels good to be on the other end of
this, doesn't it?

1046
01:02:32,809 --> 01:02:34,005
MATT: Yeah. But I feel for you.

1047
01:02:34,005 --> 01:02:35,664
TALIESIN: Fuck off. Yes.

1048
01:02:35,664 --> 01:02:37,836
(laughter)

1049
01:02:37,836 --> 01:02:39,457
LIAM: Smell the siggle.

1050
01:02:39,457 --> 01:02:40,972
MARISHA: Two successes.

1051
01:02:40,972 --> 01:02:50,658
TALIESIN: Yeah, you're fine. Nothing weird. You do
notice that the tea they're pouring is red. And it

1052
01:02:50,658 --> 01:02:51,948
smells pretty good.

1053
01:02:51,948 --> 01:03:02,085
MARISHA: It's blood! I'm so thirsty. Okay, I sit
down on the grass. Is Arwen here?

1054
01:03:02,085 --> 01:03:08,075
TALIESIN: No Arwen. Probably for the best, because
I'm not that, you know.

1055
01:03:08,075 --> 01:03:11,141
MARISHA: I have some tea.

1056
01:03:11,141 --> 01:03:22,828
TALIESIN: So as you sip the tea, Eric and Whitney
giggle, talk, and make notes. "There's a big thing

1057
01:03:22,828 --> 01:03:33,358
"happening tonight. There's going to be a big new
change to the show. And as soon as we get that

1058
01:03:33,358 --> 01:03:42,206
"little lock problem off of the Twitch stage,
everything will be great. We've been trying to

1059
01:03:42,206 --> 01:03:47,892
"figure out how to open the Twitch stage, and
there's a little lock, and he's very excited for

1060
01:03:47,892 --> 01:03:53,938
"you to figure out his little puzzle. He says it
shouldn't be too hard for people like you to

1061
01:03:53,938 --> 01:03:54,857
"figure out."

1062
01:03:54,857 --> 01:03:56,357
MARISHA: Oh, you've been talking to the lock.

1063
01:03:56,357 --> 01:04:01,056
TALIESIN: "We've been talking to Father. Father
has been helping us redesign the show, it's going

1064
01:04:01,056 --> 01:04:02,303
"to be really good."

1065
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:04,971
MARISHA: Wait, is Father Father his full name?
Like first name, Father, last name, Father?

1066
01:04:04,971 --> 01:04:15,931
TALIESIN: "No. (giggling) No, he's very excited,
though. He's very excited for you to figure out

1067
01:04:15,931 --> 01:04:32,089
"his little riddle. It's going to be good. You
should figure out his riddle. Can we help you? I

1068
01:04:32,089 --> 01:04:36,559
"mean, I know you're not supposed to be in this
meeting. We're really thankful that you're here, but--"

1069
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:40,617
MARISHA: It's my fucking office, bitches.

1070
01:04:40,617 --> 01:04:43,272
TALIESIN: "Sure, but we kind of had the room?"

1071
01:04:43,272 --> 01:04:45,164
TRAVIS: Try the tea.

1072
01:04:45,164 --> 01:04:46,791
MARISHA: I've been drinking the tea.

1073
01:04:46,791 --> 01:04:52,318
TALIESIN: It tastes good. It tastes a little
weird. It tastes really good. Tastes like blood.

1074
01:04:52,318 --> 01:04:54,710
It's a little bitter. It's good.

1075
01:04:54,710 --> 01:04:59,125
LAURA: Maybe it's like mushroom blood tea.

1076
01:04:59,125 --> 01:05:06,606
MARISHA: I'm not getting dosed, am I? That would
suck.

1077
01:05:06,606 --> 01:05:07,982
TALIESIN: We'll find out, won't we?

1078
01:05:07,982 --> 01:05:09,094
LAURA: Did we make it to the front door yet?

1079
01:05:09,094 --> 01:05:10,003
SAM: Yeah, we're hustling.

1080
01:05:10,003 --> 01:05:12,675
TALIESIN: You want to hustle? As you turn the
corner to the front door--

1081
01:05:12,675 --> 01:05:14,559
LIAM: Wait, Eric, did you get your suit for the
wedding?

1082
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:18,644
TALIESIN: "Yeah."

1083
01:05:18,644 --> 01:05:21,841
LAURA: It's definitely a flesh suit.

1084
01:05:21,841 --> 01:05:27,717
TALIESIN: Of course it is. As you turn the corner,
Lego Hardwick has been propped up in front of a

1085
01:05:27,717 --> 01:05:32,862
red velvet curtain, with a sign that's blocking
off the whole front.

1086
01:05:32,862 --> 01:05:36,091
SAM: What does the sign say?

1087
01:05:36,091 --> 01:05:38,596
TALIESIN: It says "Your funeral."

1088
01:05:38,596 --> 01:05:44,840
MATT: That's not ominous at all, from a giant Lego
Hardwick.

1089
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:49,269
TALIESIN: Somehow he looks less creepy. I'm not
entirely sure how they pulled that off.

1090
01:05:49,269 --> 01:05:53,235
LAURA: Do you think it's because Matt said we're
light sensitive?

1091
01:05:53,235 --> 01:05:56,361
SAM: Maybe. Do you want to peek out?

1092
01:05:56,361 --> 01:05:58,785
LAURA: I can try. Do you want to do it?

1093
01:05:58,785 --> 01:06:03,183
SAM: I'll hold you so if you cry out in pain, I'll
pull you back.

1094
01:06:03,183 --> 01:06:07,400
TALIESIN: Matt, really quickly, roll a wits and
willpower.

1095
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:16,509
SAM: Taliesin, Laura's going to peek out.

1096
01:06:16,509 --> 01:06:18,747
LAURA: Sam's going to hold onto my back.

1097
01:06:18,747 --> 01:06:20,359
TALIESIN: Hold on.

1098
01:06:20,359 --> 01:06:29,990
MATT: That was a good roll for me. That is a crit
success, with six successes.

1099
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:37,456
TALIESIN: You felt a weird push towards that
curtain that you can't quite identify. That was

1100
01:06:37,456 --> 01:06:40,785
very odd. That's very strange.

1101
01:06:40,785 --> 01:06:44,728
MATT: I'll go first! I just want to see, I'm
really interested.

1102
01:06:44,728 --> 01:06:47,169
SAM: But you said we could be light sensitive.

1103
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:53,556
MATT: I have a good mind for these things, and you
know what? My intuition's telling me that I go first.

1104
01:06:53,556 --> 01:06:55,698
LAURA: You're acting really weird, Matt.

1105
01:06:55,698 --> 01:07:03,019
TALIESIN: He gets just far enough to grab his hand
onto the curtain, and a beam of daylight comes

1106
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:07,271
streaking right through and hits you square in the
head.

1107
01:07:07,271 --> 01:07:09,003
MATT: Shit.

1108
01:07:09,003 --> 01:07:13,745
SAM: Does he cry out in pain or anything?

1109
01:07:13,745 --> 01:07:15,500
TALIESIN: He doesn't cry out. No, nothing happens.

1110
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:17,855
LAURA: Does it hurt?

1111
01:07:17,855 --> 01:07:20,449
MATT: Am I fine? Does it hurt me?

1112
01:07:20,449 --> 01:07:23,772
TALIESIN: Slowly, the two halves of you separate
at the head.

1113
01:07:23,772 --> 01:07:26,338
SAM: I pull him back!

1114
01:07:26,338 --> 01:07:30,550
LAURA: I'm going to squish his halves together and
hold him together!

1115
01:07:30,550 --> 01:07:32,837
TALIESIN: And Matt Mercer drops into a pile of
ash.

1116
01:07:32,837 --> 01:07:39,398
(shouting)

1117
01:07:39,398 --> 01:07:41,790
MARISHA: We always knew you'd be the first to go
in the apocalypse.

1118
01:07:41,790 --> 01:07:43,268
LAURA: You're dead already?

1119
01:07:43,268 --> 01:07:45,666
TRAVIS: He's literally a pile of ash? Clothes,
anything, just ash?

1120
01:07:45,666 --> 01:07:46,903
TALIESIN: Just ash.

1121
01:07:46,903 --> 01:07:48,555
TRAVIS: (shouting) Pick up the ashes!

1122
01:07:48,555 --> 01:07:50,746
SAM: I'm picking up the ashes.

1123
01:07:50,746 --> 01:07:53,025
LAURA: (shouting) Marisha's going to be so upset!

1124
01:07:53,025 --> 01:07:54,597
SAM: I don't know what to do, I'm putting them in
our pockets!

1125
01:07:54,597 --> 01:07:56,428
LIAM: Why are you always the one who picks up the
ashes?

1126
01:07:56,428 --> 01:08:00,827
TALIESIN: Marisha, there is nothing funny about
this. You shouldn't be laughing.

1127
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:02,610
TRAVIS: She's not out here!

1128
01:08:02,610 --> 01:08:06,918
MARISHA: I'm not there! I'm in the office!

1129
01:08:06,918 --> 01:08:09,740
TALIESIN: You're not there? Oh shit. Well you
certainly are hearing screaming now.

1130
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:11,046
SAM: I start crying.

1131
01:08:11,046 --> 01:08:13,190
LIAM: I'm with Marisha in the office.

1132
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:14,749
LAURA: We're crying.

1133
01:08:14,749 --> 01:08:16,945
TRAVIS: No, I'm not crying, I'm freaking the fuck
out!

1134
01:08:16,945 --> 01:08:19,927
TALIESIN: You are having the best creative meeting
ever, by the way.

1135
01:08:19,927 --> 01:08:22,886
MARISHA: This is a great creative meeting. I kind
of miss this.

1136
01:08:22,886 --> 01:08:26,666
SAM: Oh god! What are we going to do? Should we
tell Marisha?

1137
01:08:26,666 --> 01:08:30,230
TRAVIS: No! Yes! No!

1138
01:08:30,230 --> 01:08:31,853
SAM: I think we're alone.

1139
01:08:31,853 --> 01:08:33,753
TRAVIS: I'm out there with you, I'm by the
server.

1140
01:08:33,753 --> 01:08:36,137
LAURA: If he was by the server room he totally
would've seen it happen.

1141
01:08:36,137 --> 01:08:37,822
SAM: We can't tell Marisha, they were about to get
married!

1142
01:08:37,822 --> 01:08:41,428
LIAM: Meanwhile, back in the office: This is why I
never get in the middle of G&amp;S conversations,

1143
01:08:41,428 --> 01:08:46,108
because you guys have your own language. I never
know what you're talking about, and it's best that

1144
01:08:46,108 --> 01:08:47,827
I just stay out of your way.

1145
01:08:47,827 --> 01:08:50,505
TRAVIS: Do we bring the ashes with us or do we
like put them in a trash bin?

1146
01:08:50,505 --> 01:08:58,950
MATT: It's not just ashes. Amongst the pile, there
is still a foam sword and a Power Ranger helmet.

1147
01:08:58,950 --> 01:09:01,948
This is important guys, don't leave that behind.

1148
01:09:01,948 --> 01:09:04,109
LAURA: I pick up the Power Ranger helmet.

1149
01:09:04,109 --> 01:09:05,447
TALIESIN: It's not going to help you.

1150
01:09:05,447 --> 01:09:07,692
LAURA: Can we put the ashes in the Power Ranger
helmet?

1151
01:09:07,692 --> 01:09:08,969
TALIESIN: You can.

1152
01:09:08,969 --> 01:09:11,030
MARISHA: Oh my god, that's so sad!

1153
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:14,775
SAM: I'll pile the ashes in the helmet.

1154
01:09:14,775 --> 01:09:18,850
TRAVIS: We don't tell Marisha! She'll freak out.
Maybe there's a way to undo it.

1155
01:09:18,850 --> 01:09:21,919
LAURA: To bring his ashes back?

1156
01:09:21,919 --> 01:09:26,388
SAM: No, if we break the magic, everything comes
back to normal. That's how these things work.

1157
01:09:26,388 --> 01:09:30,087
LAURA: What, do you think this is magic? You don't
think we're actually fucking vampires right now?

1158
01:09:30,087 --> 01:09:31,462
TRAVIS: Did you eat a rat a second ago?

1159
01:09:31,462 --> 01:09:36,763
LAURA: I ate a rat! I feel like this is real life!
It's not going to go back.

1160
01:09:36,763 --> 01:09:44,972
TALIESIN: You hear thunderous sounds of something
being tossed around really violently upstairs,

1161
01:09:44,972 --> 01:09:53,522
like somebody is doing demolition up there and
then it suddenly stops. You can see, from your

1162
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:58,660
vantage point, everyone in the front office of
Geek &amp; Sundry looks up. And then goes right back

1163
01:09:58,660 --> 01:10:01,365
to work, like trying to pretend that nothing
happened.

1164
01:10:01,365 --> 01:10:02,526
MARISHA: I pop out of the office--

1165
01:10:02,526 --> 01:10:06,557
TALIESIN: You do not get that far. Do you try and
stand up?

1166
01:10:06,557 --> 01:10:11,904
MARISHA: Yeah? I was going to go talk to Dani.

1167
01:10:11,904 --> 01:10:13,234
LAURA: Oh no, you drank the tea.

1168
01:10:13,234 --> 01:10:16,513
TALIESIN: Yeah. What did we learn about drinking
the tea?

1169
01:10:16,513 --> 01:10:20,409
MARISHA: You know, it looked real good. You said
it looked bloody. I'm real thirsty.

1170
01:10:20,409 --> 01:10:25,696
TALIESIN: I will also say: while it is not sun
tea, it is Sean tea.

1171
01:10:25,696 --> 01:10:30,787
MARISHA: Ashanti about a Sean tea?.

1172
01:10:30,787 --> 01:10:32,557
LAURA: It's made of Sean?

1173
01:10:32,557 --> 01:10:35,205
TALIESIN: It is made of Sean.

1174
01:10:35,205 --> 01:10:36,996
MARISHA: Wait, you mean it's <i>Sean</i> tea?

1175
01:10:36,996 --> 01:10:50,070
TALIESIN: With a hint of mushroom for flavor. As
you go to stand up from the grass, you notice that--

1176
01:10:50,070 --> 01:10:54,322
MARISHA: (shouting) I'm drinking my best friend's
essence! That's gross!

1177
01:10:54,322 --> 01:11:01,548
TALIESIN: Your legs have turned into little
mushrooms in the grass. And they're starting to

1178
01:11:01,548 --> 01:11:04,760
push through your abdomen as well, and come up
through your throat.

1179
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:11,714
LIAM: No! I'm going to start scraping them off, if
I can.

1180
01:11:11,714 --> 01:11:21,806
TALIESIN: Make a stanima-- a stanima roll.

1181
01:11:21,806 --> 01:11:25,026
LIAM: Okay. Just straight, right?

1182
01:11:25,026 --> 01:11:28,610
TALIESIN: Just kind of a simple one.

1183
01:11:28,610 --> 01:11:33,991
LIAM: That's a failure on the red. No it's not,
it's a five, and ones are the only failure.

1184
01:11:33,991 --> 01:11:36,051
TALIESIN: Ones are the only fail. There's a big X
when you go wrong.

1185
01:11:36,051 --> 01:11:37,376
LIAM: So one success.

1186
01:11:37,376 --> 01:11:43,677
TALIESIN: The stuff starts sticking to you in a
way that you don't like, and it burns a little

1187
01:11:43,677 --> 01:11:48,429
bit. You probably want to wipe your hands off. And
while you were wiping her off, it was starting to

1188
01:11:48,429 --> 01:11:51,229
go straight through the skin like there was
nothing under there other than mushrooms.

1189
01:11:51,229 --> 01:11:55,964
MARISHA: It's just something I ate. Mushrooms have
never sat well with me.

1190
01:11:55,964 --> 01:11:58,298
TALIESIN: And that's the last thing Marisha ever
said.

1191
01:11:58,298 --> 01:12:01,380
(shouting)

1192
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:02,794
LIAM: (shouting) No!

1193
01:12:02,794 --> 01:12:07,676
LAURA: We come barging in: (crying) You guys!

1194
01:12:07,676 --> 01:12:09,920
SAM: (crying) Marisha, I'm so sorry! He's gone!

1195
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:12,242
TRAVIS: What'd you do?

1196
01:12:12,242 --> 01:12:14,121
LIAM: She's a mushroom.

1197
01:12:14,121 --> 01:12:15,205
TRAVIS: What do you mean?

1198
01:12:15,205 --> 01:12:18,972
LIAM: She's a mushroom, look! And I push into her
shoulder.

1199
01:12:18,972 --> 01:12:22,077
TALIESIN: She leans right over and you've got
powder on your hand.

1200
01:12:22,077 --> 01:12:25,244
(shouting)

1201
01:12:25,244 --> 01:12:33,682
TRAVIS: Oh fuck! What happened? We took care of
the guy we were with. What'd you do?

1202
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:34,926
LIAM: Where's Matt?

1203
01:12:34,926 --> 01:12:36,807
LAURA: (shouting) He's in the Power Rangers
helmet!

1204
01:12:36,807 --> 01:12:40,202
(shouting)

1205
01:12:40,202 --> 01:12:48,294
TALIESIN: Suddenly, Christian bursts into the
room. He is covered in blood and says, "Can you

1206
01:12:48,294 --> 01:12:49,797
"keep it down?"

1207
01:12:49,797 --> 01:12:51,104
TRAVIS: Does he smell good?

1208
01:12:51,104 --> 01:12:58,105
TALIESIN: He does. "You guys are making a lot of
noise, and people are trying to work. God!" And he

1209
01:12:58,105 --> 01:12:59,603
goes back out.

1210
01:12:59,603 --> 01:13:07,185
LAURA: I'm going to set Matt's helmet down next to
Marisha's mushroom head.

1211
01:13:07,185 --> 01:13:10,622
TRAVIS: Okay. Not sure what's happening? Sun: bad.
Sun very bad.

1212
01:13:10,622 --> 01:13:12,938
SAM: Don't go out the front door. Don't drink
anything.

1213
01:13:12,938 --> 01:13:14,968
LIAM: Don't drink the tea! She drank the tea!

1214
01:13:14,968 --> 01:13:20,832
SAM: Do we get a refund on the wedding gift?

1215
01:13:20,832 --> 01:13:26,285
LIAM: I literally just bought a new suit. It's a
good suit.

1216
01:13:26,285 --> 01:13:29,786
SAM: Is it an automatic refund thing, or do we
have to apply for it?

1217
01:13:29,786 --> 01:13:31,925
MARISHA: (whispering) Take my safety deposit!

1218
01:13:31,925 --> 01:13:38,287
TRAVIS: Can I look at Dani? Dani, why are you
wearing a sign that says "Drink me"?

1219
01:13:38,287 --> 01:13:40,068
TALIESIN: Actually, Dani's one of the few who
isn't.

1220
01:13:40,068 --> 01:13:45,733
TRAVIS: Not wearing a sign. Chris is. Why are you
wearing a sign that says "Drink me?"

1221
01:13:45,733 --> 01:13:48,293
TALIESIN: "He said I had to. I'm sorry, I
can't--"

1222
01:13:48,293 --> 01:13:50,013
TRAVIS: Father said you had to?

1223
01:13:50,013 --> 01:13:53,052
TALIESIN: He's not in a mood to talk.

1224
01:13:53,052 --> 01:13:54,956
SAM: Is Father Chris Hardwick?

1225
01:13:54,956 --> 01:13:58,468
TRAVIS: We should kill Chris.

1226
01:13:58,468 --> 01:13:59,698
SAM: Hardwick?

1227
01:13:59,698 --> 01:14:02,136
TRAVIS: Nope. This Chris.

1228
01:14:02,136 --> 01:14:03,422
LAURA: Why?

1229
01:14:03,422 --> 01:14:08,055
TRAVIS: Chris, do you want me to kill you? We
shouldn't kill Chris.

1230
01:14:08,055 --> 01:14:14,100
TALIESIN: He does smell-- Well, no, you're at one.
You're fine.

1231
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:19,498
LIAM: Hey, just a side note. For their wedding, I
bought them a big block of tickets to Hamilton,

1232
01:14:19,498 --> 01:14:21,053
and they can't use them now.

1233
01:14:21,053 --> 01:14:22,608
TRAVIS: The wedding's done, Liam!

1234
01:14:22,608 --> 01:14:25,422
LIAM: I get that. Would you like to see Hamilton
again?

1235
01:14:25,422 --> 01:14:33,450
TALIESIN: Suddenly the creative room stops. All
eyes turn to Liam.

1236
01:14:33,450 --> 01:14:38,645
LIAM: I mean, if anyone wants to buy them off me,
I'll cut you a real good deal.

1237
01:14:38,645 --> 01:14:41,136
TALIESIN: And they slowly start to get up.

1238
01:14:41,136 --> 01:14:42,515
LIAM: Wait, what's going on?

1239
01:14:42,515 --> 01:14:44,707
TALIESIN: "You have Hamilton tickets?"

1240
01:14:44,707 --> 01:14:54,064
LIAM: I mean, not on me! But I could never tell
you where they are if I'm eaten!

1241
01:14:54,064 --> 01:15:01,078
TALIESIN: Whitney and Eric slowly move towards
you, and as they open their mouths a little wider,

1242
01:15:01,078 --> 01:15:06,053
you see that there is nothing in there. It's just
a void in their mouths.

1243
01:15:06,053 --> 01:15:08,864
SAM: I'm going to whip Whitney in the face with an
XLR cable!

1244
01:15:08,864 --> 01:15:14,553
TALIESIN: Let's do dexterity with brawl.

1245
01:15:14,553 --> 01:15:22,270
SAM: All successes. Three successes!

1246
01:15:22,270 --> 01:15:34,098
TALIESIN: Three successes? You get her right in
the face. She falls down with a big cut right

1247
01:15:34,098 --> 01:15:40,959
across her face. This black dust comes poofing out
of it like soot. She's giggling on the floor,

1248
01:15:40,959 --> 01:15:48,700
rolling around in laughter. The whole room starts
to bend, glitter, and shift. Everything's getting

1249
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:53,765
a little soft in there. Maybe you've been
breathing too many of the spores.

1250
01:15:53,765 --> 01:15:58,859
SAM: Like I feel like I'm seeing trails?

1251
01:15:58,859 --> 01:16:01,644
TALIESIN: How do you feel like you're seeing
things? You're either seeing something or you're

1252
01:16:01,644 --> 01:16:04,045
not. If you're seeing it, it's either real or it
isn't.

1253
01:16:04,045 --> 01:16:05,268
SAM: Does it feel good?

1254
01:16:05,268 --> 01:16:13,183
TALIESIN: It doesn't feel good. It feels like
things are going to turn on you at any second.

1255
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:16,833
SAM: I'm going to back up, cock my XLR cable.

1256
01:16:16,833 --> 01:16:19,439
LAURA: We should shut the door. I'm going to shut
the office door.

1257
01:16:19,439 --> 01:16:21,497
TRAVIS: We got to get Liam out of there!

1258
01:16:21,497 --> 01:16:23,155
LAURA: Liam's in there still?

1259
01:16:23,155 --> 01:16:25,824
TALIESIN: It's up to you if you backed up with
everybody.

1260
01:16:25,824 --> 01:16:28,012
LIAM: Wherever Sam is, I am now.

1261
01:16:28,012 --> 01:16:30,972
TRAVIS: I kick Eric dead in the chest just for good
measure.

1262
01:16:30,972 --> 01:16:35,523
MATT: Just for good measure.

1263
01:16:35,523 --> 01:16:37,858
TRAVIS: He was coming after Liam!

1264
01:16:37,858 --> 01:16:38,907
LIAM: He's big!

1265
01:16:38,907 --> 01:16:40,484
TALIESIN: Strength brawl.

1266
01:16:40,484 --> 01:16:42,643
TRAVIS: Just strength?

1267
01:16:42,643 --> 01:16:51,382
TALIESIN: Strength brawl. Get weird. What's your
power again? Okay, never mind. I know what your

1268
01:16:51,382 --> 01:16:52,851
power is.

1269
01:16:52,851 --> 01:16:55,757
SAM: Matt and Marisha!

1270
01:16:55,757 --> 01:16:57,441
LAURA: You guys are so dead!

1271
01:16:57,441 --> 01:17:01,151
TRAVIS: Six successes, no failures.

1272
01:17:01,151 --> 01:17:09,090
TALIESIN: Six successes, no fails? Your foot goes
right through the center of him in a big poof of soot.

1273
01:17:09,090 --> 01:17:11,622
TRAVIS: (coughing) I back out.

1274
01:17:11,622 --> 01:17:18,102
TALIESIN: When you pull out, he is again on the
ground hiccuping in a laugh and the shoe you were

1275
01:17:18,102 --> 01:17:22,123
wearing is now a different shoe than you have on
your other foot.

1276
01:17:22,123 --> 01:17:26,830
TRAVIS: My shoe changed. I kicked him in the chest
and my shoe changed.

1277
01:17:26,830 --> 01:17:28,110
SAM: Is it a Jordan?

1278
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:33,340
TALIESIN: It's not a nice shoe. It's definitely a
Ross Men's For Less shoe.

1279
01:17:33,340 --> 01:17:39,508
LIAM: Do Laura and I also see a changed shoe? We
all see a changed shoe?

1280
01:17:39,508 --> 01:17:42,906
LAURA: Why did his shoe change? Travis, get out of
the fucking room!

1281
01:17:42,906 --> 01:17:44,350
LIAM: Is that your vampire power?

1282
01:17:44,350 --> 01:17:46,750
TRAVIS: I got out of it, though! His chest gives
you new shoes!

1283
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:53,006
LAURA: I'm shutting the door now and I'm grabbing
a chair and I'm putting it in the thing to block the

1284
01:17:53,006 --> 01:17:55,080
office.

1285
01:17:55,126 --> 01:17:57,483
TALIESIN: Dani's looking at all of you.

1286
01:17:57,483 --> 01:17:59,758
TRAVIS: Is she still sitting down?

1287
01:17:59,758 --> 01:18:00,678
TALIESIN: She is.

1288
01:18:00,678 --> 01:18:01,706
LAURA: Dani, this is messed up.

1289
01:18:01,706 --> 01:18:02,713
TALIESIN: "I agree."

1290
01:18:02,713 --> 01:18:03,904
LAURA: Matt and Marisha are dead.

1291
01:18:03,904 --> 01:18:04,998
TALIESIN: "Yes, I know."

1292
01:18:04,998 --> 01:18:06,305
TRAVIS: Dani, show me your hands!

1293
01:18:06,305 --> 01:18:08,372
TALIESIN: "Jazz hands."

1294
01:18:08,372 --> 01:18:12,635
LIAM: Open your mouth. Can I see anything? Is
there a void?

1295
01:18:12,635 --> 01:18:16,720
TALIESIN: Not at the moment. Her eyes do have the
weird little mold. There's a little bit of the

1296
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:20,627
mold, the closer you look, the lips and eyes,
little bit of the gray mold going on.

1297
01:18:20,627 --> 01:18:22,243
LAURA: Dani, did you eat mushrooms?

1298
01:18:22,243 --> 01:18:24,308
TALIESIN: "No."

1299
01:18:24,308 --> 01:18:26,933
SAM: Can't kill anyone! I just whipped somebody in
the face and they laughed!

1300
01:18:26,933 --> 01:18:30,180
TRAVIS: Yeah, I kicked Eric's chest out and he
started laughing.

1301
01:18:30,180 --> 01:18:33,119
TALIESIN: Dani goes into her desk and she pulls
out a key card for you all.

1302
01:18:33,119 --> 01:18:34,822
LAURA: Thanks. What is this for?

1303
01:18:34,822 --> 01:18:42,432
TALIESIN: And a little wooden stake. She's like,
"You should probably get going, there's a lot of

1304
01:18:42,432 --> 01:18:47,526
"work to do if you're going to make it to the
Twitch show on time." She goes back to working on

1305
01:18:47,526 --> 01:18:49,154
her unpowered laptop.

1306
01:18:49,154 --> 01:18:52,820
TRAVIS: Unpowered laptop. Just black screen?

1307
01:18:52,820 --> 01:18:54,970
TALIESIN: Everybody's is black screens.

1308
01:18:54,970 --> 01:18:56,563
TRAVIS: She's typing furiously?

1309
01:18:56,563 --> 01:18:58,030
TALIESIN: Everybody's typing on nothing.

1310
01:18:58,030 --> 01:19:00,534
LAURA: This is really weird, you guys.

1311
01:19:00,534 --> 01:19:04,430
TRAVIS: Hey. Should we bring one of these "Drink
Me" guys with us?

1312
01:19:04,430 --> 01:19:05,447
LAURA: Why?

1313
01:19:05,447 --> 01:19:06,673
TRAVIS: I don't know.

1314
01:19:06,673 --> 01:19:10,941
SAM: In case we want to drink them? Or feed them
to somebody else?

1315
01:19:10,941 --> 01:19:12,751
TRAVIS: Like a decoy. No offense, Chris.

1316
01:19:12,751 --> 01:19:15,965
LIAM: We hit them, they fucked with our brains.

1317
01:19:15,965 --> 01:19:17,891
LAURA: Not the "Drink Me" ones.

1318
01:19:17,891 --> 01:19:22,583
TALIESIN: They don't have as much of the-- they're
still there, they're not giggling.

1319
01:19:22,583 --> 01:19:24,242
TRAVIS: Chris, do you want to come with us?

1320
01:19:24,242 --> 01:19:25,500
TALIESIN: "No."

1321
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:26,485
LAURA: What about you, Arcade?

1322
01:19:26,485 --> 01:19:28,026
LIAM: Yeah, Arcade, are you good?

1323
01:19:28,026 --> 01:19:35,775
TALIESIN: Arcade's trying to not even look at you
guys. There's another huge thump above from the

1324
01:19:35,775 --> 01:19:40,864
offices above and the sounds of knives scraping
into walls and glass.

1325
01:19:40,864 --> 01:19:43,389
SAM: I'm going to try to glamor him.

1326
01:19:43,389 --> 01:19:45,747
LAURA: You can do that?

1327
01:19:45,747 --> 01:19:47,540
TALIESIN: What power do you have right now?

1328
01:19:47,540 --> 01:19:52,613
SAM: Power? I don't have power; I'm going to try
to convince him with the power of my words.

1329
01:19:52,613 --> 01:19:57,805
LAURA: You're not Scanlan, you're a vampire.

1330
01:19:57,805 --> 01:20:00,700
TRAVIS: You don't know that. We're all a bit of
our characters.

1331
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:07,927
SAM: Going to say: you need to come with us right
now. You cannot resist. The power of Christ

1332
01:20:07,927 --> 01:20:09,064
compels you.

1333
01:20:09,064 --> 01:20:11,310
(laughter)

1334
01:20:11,310 --> 01:20:19,718
TRAVIS: He burns. Bursts into flame. (yelling) Oh
god, he rolled something.

1335
01:20:19,718 --> 01:20:21,132
SAM: I watched True Blood.

1336
01:20:21,132 --> 01:20:31,727
TALIESIN: Something feels weird, but it doesn't
quite work right. You don't know what you felt,

1337
01:20:31,727 --> 01:20:33,158
but you felt a little vibration.

1338
01:20:33,158 --> 01:20:35,084
SAM: A good vibration?

1339
01:20:35,084 --> 01:20:36,077
TALIESIN: <i>Good</i> vibration.

1340
01:20:36,077 --> 01:20:38,493
TRAVIS: (singing) It's a good vibration!

1341
01:20:38,493 --> 01:20:42,936
SAM: You can feel it! It felt good?

1342
01:20:42,936 --> 01:20:46,025
TALIESIN: Yeah, you felt a little twitch.

1343
01:20:46,025 --> 01:20:52,021
SAM: Then I'm going to do it again. I'm going to
yell at him. You're nothing without us! We keep the

1344
01:20:52,021 --> 01:20:54,067
lights on in this place! Come with us!

1345
01:20:54,067 --> 01:21:00,827
TALIESIN: He looks afraid, but he's cowering a
little bit.

1346
01:21:00,827 --> 01:21:02,583
LAURA: Sam, be nice to him, he's a really cool
guy.

1347
01:21:02,583 --> 01:21:04,336
SAM: I don't know what I'm doing.

1348
01:21:04,336 --> 01:21:07,359
LAURA: I'm going to go over to Arcade and put my
hand on his shoulder.

1349
01:21:07,359 --> 01:21:16,502
TALIESIN: What am I going to do? Roll a d10.

1350
01:21:16,502 --> 01:21:18,451
LAURA: Just 1d10?

1351
01:21:18,451 --> 01:21:19,562
TALIESIN: How many red do you have right now?

1352
01:21:19,562 --> 01:21:20,561
LAURA: Just one.

1353
01:21:20,561 --> 01:21:21,650
TALIESIN: Roll a d10.

1354
01:21:21,650 --> 01:21:26,191
LAURA: Ooh. I rolled a three. So close.

1355
01:21:26,191 --> 01:21:30,567
TALIESIN: You have a moment when you touch him
where you really think about tearing right into that

1356
01:21:30,567 --> 01:21:34,490
throat. Your fangs start to grow.

1357
01:21:34,490 --> 01:21:40,736
LIAM: You all right, La? Why are you--?

1358
01:21:40,736 --> 01:21:43,708
LAURA: Arcade looks really good is all.

1359
01:21:43,708 --> 01:21:45,511
LIAM: You need chapstick?

1360
01:21:45,511 --> 01:21:48,979
LAURA: Do you want to come with us?

1361
01:21:48,979 --> 01:21:57,606
TRAVIS: Which teeth began to grow? The buck teeth
or the canines?

1362
01:21:57,606 --> 01:22:00,277
TALIESIN: Bit of both.

1363
01:22:00,277 --> 01:22:05,261
LAURA: Upstairs, maybe? Are we going to the Twitch
set? I don't know. What's happening upstairs?

1364
01:22:05,261 --> 01:22:06,986
TALIESIN: "You don't want to go upstairs."

1365
01:22:06,986 --> 01:22:09,892
TRAVIS: We should go to the Twitch set.

1366
01:22:09,892 --> 01:22:14,675
LAURA: Let's go to the Twitch set. Come on, let's
go. It'll be so much fun. Come on.

1367
01:22:14,675 --> 01:22:16,813
TALIESIN: You can try and drag him.

1368
01:22:16,813 --> 01:22:20,687
LAURA: You want to go to the Twitch set?

1369
01:22:20,687 --> 01:22:22,033
TALIESIN: "I want to stay here."

1370
01:22:22,033 --> 01:22:24,069
TRAVIS: Fine, we'll leave him.

1371
01:22:24,069 --> 01:22:25,563
LIAM: I'm pulling Sam away for a minute.

1372
01:22:25,563 --> 01:22:26,894
SAM: What?

1373
01:22:26,894 --> 01:22:32,142
LIAM: Whispering. Listen to me. Those guys, I love
them, but they're married and--

1374
01:22:32,142 --> 01:22:33,943
SAM: Who's married? Oh, Laura.

1375
01:22:33,943 --> 01:22:35,520
LAURA: Baby! Look at my teeth!

1376
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:37,652
TRAVIS: What the fuck?

1377
01:22:37,652 --> 01:22:38,604
LAURA: I know!

1378
01:22:38,604 --> 01:22:39,436
SAM: What are you saying?

1379
01:22:39,436 --> 01:22:40,759
LIAM: I'm saying that you and me.

1380
01:22:40,759 --> 01:22:43,278
SAM: An alliance?

1381
01:22:43,278 --> 01:22:49,407
LIAM: You are my best friend! They are my best
friends, but they're married!

1382
01:22:49,407 --> 01:22:52,907
TRAVIS: I'll actually use my heightened senses.

1383
01:22:52,907 --> 01:22:55,766
TALIESIN: What's the roll for that?

1384
01:22:55,766 --> 01:22:58,840
TRAVIS: I see hunger roll is perception plus
investigation.

1385
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:01,015
LIAM: They <i>have</i> to help each other!

1386
01:23:01,015 --> 01:23:03,486
SAM: Okay, if shit goes down, I'll help you.

1387
01:23:03,486 --> 01:23:05,813
TRAVIS: Liam's whispering and Sam's talking in a
normal voice.

1388
01:23:05,813 --> 01:23:09,469
TALIESIN: To be fair, I'm going to let you have
this. You can hear all of this.

1389
01:23:09,469 --> 01:23:13,825
LIAM: I'm just saying if things go pear-shaped, I
got you.

1390
01:23:13,825 --> 01:23:17,432
TRAVIS: They're saying if things go pear-shaped,
they're going to fuck us and take care of each

1391
01:23:17,432 --> 01:23:18,488
other.

1392
01:23:18,488 --> 01:23:19,687
LAURA: You dicks!

1393
01:23:19,687 --> 01:23:22,508
SAM: No, we didn't say that! We said that we would
look out for each other.

1394
01:23:22,508 --> 01:23:23,818
TALIESIN: Travis, I have a gift for you.

1395
01:23:23,818 --> 01:23:29,379
LAURA: Oh, you're hungry! You're getting hungrier!
We should get out of this room.

1396
01:23:29,379 --> 01:23:40,097
SAM: What do we know? There's some sort of Twitch
performance that we have to get to. There's a

1397
01:23:40,097 --> 01:23:46,326
Twitch show, there's something upstairs, there's
weird shit on the walls being written. Do we know

1398
01:23:46,326 --> 01:23:47,286
what that is?

1399
01:23:47,286 --> 01:23:48,671
LAURA: We definitely can't leave.

1400
01:23:48,671 --> 01:23:49,874
TALIESIN: Not until the sun sets.

1401
01:23:49,874 --> 01:23:51,306
MATT: (gasps)

1402
01:23:51,306 --> 01:23:52,660
SAM: Matt's dead.

1403
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:54,268
LAURA: Marisha's dead.

1404
01:23:54,268 --> 01:23:55,751
SAM: Marisha's a spore.

1405
01:23:55,751 --> 01:23:56,998
LAURA: We don't know where Taliesin is.

1406
01:23:56,998 --> 01:23:58,771
LIAM: The wedding is probably not happening.

1407
01:23:58,771 --> 01:24:03,286
LAURA: We would be doing so well if Taliesin was
here. He would totally know what to do right now.

1408
01:24:03,286 --> 01:24:08,070
MARISHA: The wedding is probably not happening
after those two conclusions!

1409
01:24:08,070 --> 01:24:11,924
TALIESIN: Dust and mushrooms. We are marrying dust
and mushrooms.

1410
01:24:11,924 --> 01:24:16,304
TRAVIS: We've been to the front door, we've been
to the bullpen, we've been to the server room.

1411
01:24:16,304 --> 01:24:18,071
LAURA: We got to go to the Twitch stage.

1412
01:24:18,071 --> 01:24:19,639
TRAVIS: And there's that area beyond the Twitch
stage that I never go into.

1413
01:24:19,639 --> 01:24:22,563
LAURA: Oh yeah, the back area! Let's make our way
to the Twitch area.

1414
01:24:22,563 --> 01:24:25,777
SAM: Yeah, let's go! Liam!

1415
01:24:25,777 --> 01:24:26,976
LIAM: What's up, yes?

1416
01:24:26,976 --> 01:24:28,188
SAM: We're going to the Twitch area!

1417
01:24:28,188 --> 01:24:36,897
TALIESIN: In a little while, when we come back, we
will be going to the Twitch area. You guys are

1418
01:24:36,897 --> 01:24:37,919
adorable.

1419
01:24:37,919 --> 01:24:39,314
LAURA: What the heck is happening?

1420
01:24:39,314 --> 01:24:44,668
TALIESIN: I'm having fun torturing you all. I've
got so many worse things to happen. Guys, thank

1421
01:24:44,668 --> 01:24:51,022
you for enjoying my attempt to hang onto these
rules that I've written down. Things are going to

1422
01:24:51,022 --> 01:24:54,784
get a little weirder because I'm going to inform
of them of a couple new rules that they can now

1423
01:24:54,784 --> 01:24:59,931
play with since they're starting to vamp out a bit
more. Sadly, two of our party are dead and are

1424
01:24:59,931 --> 01:25:02,621
going to have to not come back to the table.

1425
01:25:02,621 --> 01:25:04,744
TRAVIS: You all died so fast!

1426
01:25:04,744 --> 01:25:06,773
MATT: You know, I knew that was going to happen,
but when the compulsion kicked in I was like:

1427
01:25:06,773 --> 01:25:08,098
Well, I rolled pretty high.

1428
01:25:08,098 --> 01:25:12,707
TALIESIN: You rolled really high. I was going to
shove you out there because you are what you are.

1429
01:25:12,707 --> 01:25:19,073
It's in an inside joke that probably 100 people
watching our stream right now are like, "Oh, I

1430
01:25:19,073 --> 01:25:22,504
"know what Matt was." It was kind of cute.

1431
01:25:22,504 --> 01:25:25,345
MATT: Lasombra.

1432
01:25:25,345 --> 01:25:27,327
TALIESIN: Nothing you need to know about until
maybe next week. We'll talk about it.

1433
01:25:27,327 --> 01:25:28,602
MATT: Well, thank you.

1434
01:25:28,602 --> 01:25:31,926
TALIESIN: Guys, thank you so much. I think we're
going to have a giveaway for something in the

1435
01:25:31,926 --> 01:25:41,132
chat and I believe we're going with "Bloodbath." I
hope you're enjoying this madness. It's going to

1436
01:25:41,132 --> 01:25:48,144
get weirder and I hope you enjoy where we're going
with all this. We'll be back in a

1437
01:25:48,144 --> 01:25:52,296
few minutes once we've watered or had other things
to drink. We'll see you soon.

1438
01:25:52,296 --> 01:25:53,795
TRAVIS: Yeah!

1439
01:25:53,795 --> 01:25:56,572
MARISHA: Don't burn down the company while I'm
dead!

1440
01:25:56,572 --> 01:47:32,640
[break]

1441
01:47:32,640 --> 01:47:36,047
TALIESIN: Dude. I get the theming. I'm kind of--

1442
01:47:36,047 --> 01:47:39,947
LAURA: I want to know where it's going.

1443
01:47:39,947 --> 01:47:48,195
TALIESIN: Two nasty little children gone. Four
sweet little children left. The winner of our

1444
01:47:48,195 --> 01:47:54,715
in-chat giveaway is Cloaked_roamer.

1445
01:47:54,715 --> 01:47:56,829
TRAVIS: Cloaked_roamer!

1446
01:47:56,829 --> 01:48:01,371
TALIESIN: Won a Wyrmwood set of ill-repute that
I'm not entirely sure of what it is or what it

1447
01:48:01,371 --> 01:48:06,513
does, but it is a thing and I'm far too nervous
trying to run this game with all of these papers

1448
01:48:06,513 --> 01:48:08,148
that I'm so glad you can't see--

1449
01:48:08,148 --> 01:48:09,805
LIAM: And it wards off Christians.

1450
01:48:09,805 --> 01:48:14,701
TALIESIN: It does apparently. Cloaked roamer? And
then I'm doing a little thing to help you guys out

1451
01:48:14,701 --> 01:48:21,187
really quickly before we come back to the game. So
that I know what I'm doing because this is crazy.

1452
01:48:21,187 --> 01:48:22,885
I hope you all are having a good time.

1453
01:48:22,885 --> 01:48:24,245
LIAM: I am having a great time.

1454
01:48:24,245 --> 01:48:28,363
SAM: This is a reasonably sized D&amp;D table now. We
have a reasonable amount of people.

1455
01:48:28,363 --> 01:48:32,510
LAURA: Yeah. There's plenty at the side-- I bumped
into you!

1456
01:48:32,510 --> 01:48:34,778
LIAM: Let's put that over our head.

1457
01:48:34,778 --> 01:48:41,310
TALIESIN: And just to remind you what's painted on
the floor when we get there.

1458
01:48:41,310 --> 01:48:44,943
LAURA: Right. I marked that down.

1459
01:48:44,943 --> 01:48:51,297
SAM: Did you guys hear this whole thing about the
clue? There's a riddle. Were you there for that or

1460
01:48:51,297 --> 01:48:53,683
is that me hearing something that Marisha heard?

1461
01:48:53,683 --> 01:48:55,298
TALIESIN: No, you've heard that.

1462
01:48:55,298 --> 01:48:57,490
LIAM: Do you need this back?

1463
01:48:57,490 --> 01:48:59,829
TALIESIN: No.

1464
01:48:59,829 --> 01:49:04,794
LIAM: Here's a heart, sun, bottom left is face,
bottom right is a cross in a circle.

1465
01:49:04,794 --> 01:49:07,420
LAURA: Oh, she gave us a--

1466
01:49:07,420 --> 01:49:10,104
TALIESIN: A foam sword.

1467
01:49:10,104 --> 01:49:14,812
LAURA: A foam sword. No, she gave us the wooden--

1468
01:49:14,812 --> 01:49:18,116
TALIESIN and LIAM: A little wooden stake.

1469
01:49:18,116 --> 01:49:22,655
TALIESIN: I think she may have given you a keycard
also. Because she was just--

1470
01:49:22,655 --> 01:49:24,271
LAURA: She was being so kind.

1471
01:49:24,271 --> 01:49:25,758
LIAM: And so much good role-playing.

1472
01:49:25,758 --> 01:49:35,806
TALIESIN: I'm having fun in the most terrifying
way possible. Oh man, this is intense. I don't

1473
01:49:35,806 --> 01:49:38,593
even know if this is a high, I'm not sure what
this is. This is jumping out of an airplane

1474
01:49:38,593 --> 01:49:41,377
without a parachute, but knowing that it's foam
underneath.

1475
01:49:41,377 --> 01:49:43,403
TRAVIS: Can we make our way back to the Twitch
stage?

1476
01:49:43,403 --> 01:49:47,522
TALIESIN: So yeah, let's pick back up. For some
reason, my volume is--

1477
01:49:47,522 --> 01:49:49,965
LIAM: (Snagglepuss voice) Oh, exit stage right,
even.

1478
01:49:49,965 --> 01:49:52,410
TRAVIS: (laughs) Oh no.

1479
01:49:52,410 --> 01:49:58,353
TALIESIN: So you make your way back, quietly
through the mess.

1480
01:49:58,353 --> 01:50:01,249
LAURA: Stealthily. We don't want to make noise
past the meat mass.

1481
01:50:01,249 --> 01:50:02,653
TALIESIN: There we are.

1482
01:50:02,653 --> 01:50:05,290
LIAM: (Snagglepuss voice) Heavens to Murgatroyd.

1483
01:50:05,290 --> 01:50:12,351
TALIESIN: Jesus. I'm going to switch to another
one, see what happens. I don't know what any of

1484
01:50:12,351 --> 01:50:14,992
these audio buttons do, so it's fun for
everybody.

1485
01:50:14,992 --> 01:50:19,539
SAM: When I did my one-shot, I played the same
song for 45 minutes so it's just a two minute--

1486
01:50:19,539 --> 01:50:23,289
LAURA: Hello?

1487
01:50:23,289 --> 01:50:33,732
TALIESIN: I'm reeling it in. It's good. You know,
you could probably hear that from somewhere. We'll

1488
01:50:33,732 --> 01:50:35,279
deal with that.

1489
01:50:35,279 --> 01:50:36,844
TRAVIS: It's all upstairs.

1490
01:50:36,844 --> 01:50:38,987
LIAM: It's probably Rachel Romero up from the
second floor.

1491
01:50:38,987 --> 01:50:48,047
TALIESIN: Only I know. Don't think I don't have
plans. So you make your way. Do you want to go

1492
01:50:48,047 --> 01:50:49,899
through the hallway or through the Nerdist
office?

1493
01:50:49,899 --> 01:50:54,427
LAURA: No. Through the hallway. I feel like the
Nerdist office-- I just feel like it's going to be here.

1494
01:50:54,427 --> 01:50:57,611
SAM: Guys, can I quickly admit that I don't know
the layout of the building at all?

1495
01:50:57,611 --> 01:51:00,662
TRAVIS: Some people know this, actually.

1496
01:51:00,662 --> 01:51:04,185
SAM: I don't know the difference between--

1497
01:51:04,185 --> 01:51:10,489
TALIESIN: I have the blueprints to the whole
building right here. I know where every window is;

1498
01:51:10,489 --> 01:51:12,090
I know where every office is.

1499
01:51:12,090 --> 01:51:13,353
LAURA: And avoid the server room.

1500
01:51:13,353 --> 01:51:15,082
SAM: Half the people you've talked about I've
never heard of.

1501
01:51:15,082 --> 01:51:18,604
TRAVIS: Definitely the safest way back to the
Twitch stage is through the Nerdist office. Sam,

1502
01:51:18,604 --> 01:51:19,679
you should lead us.

1503
01:51:19,679 --> 01:51:23,510
SAM: Okay. Sure. Which way do I go?

1504
01:51:23,510 --> 01:51:26,194
TRAVIS: Just right through this long passageway.

1505
01:51:26,194 --> 01:51:28,556
SAM: Okay. I'm at the tip of the spear, I've got
my whip. I'm going.

1506
01:51:28,556 --> 01:51:32,836
LAURA: I'm sure there's something heavy that I can
grab and use as a weapon in the Nerdist office.

1507
01:51:32,836 --> 01:51:38,099
TALIESIN: Yeah. Make a perception investigation
roll.

1508
01:51:38,099 --> 01:51:39,329
TRAVIS: Can I do the same?

1509
01:51:39,329 --> 01:51:41,461
TALIESIN: Yeah. Anybody who wants to make
perception investigation roll.

1510
01:51:41,461 --> 01:51:44,284
LAURA: Is it just perception?

1511
01:51:44,284 --> 01:51:47,371
TALIESIN: Perception plus investigation, which is
right below it.

1512
01:51:47,371 --> 01:51:49,523
TRAVIS: Oh, three successes.

1513
01:51:49,523 --> 01:51:51,055
TALIESIN: That will do.

1514
01:51:51,055 --> 01:51:55,775
LAURA: Oh god. I rolled a failure. On the red.

1515
01:51:55,775 --> 01:51:58,999
TALIESIN: What's your hunger level?

1516
01:51:58,999 --> 01:52:00,378
LAURA: This is the only one.

1517
01:52:00,378 --> 01:52:01,737
TALIESIN: Just the only one?

1518
01:52:01,737 --> 01:52:03,025
TRAVIS: Take a red die.

1519
01:52:03,025 --> 01:52:11,570
TALIESIN: Not for one. You get distracted going
through people's stuff and you're going to get

1520
01:52:11,570 --> 01:52:15,355
left a little behind. You'll be at the back of the
line by the time this is done.

1521
01:52:15,355 --> 01:52:16,507
LAURA: Did I see anything?

1522
01:52:16,507 --> 01:52:17,561
TRAVIS: Three successes.

1523
01:52:17,561 --> 01:52:20,576
TALIESIN: Three successes? No, you didn't find
anything.

1524
01:52:20,576 --> 01:52:21,762
LAURA: Nothing?

1525
01:52:21,762 --> 01:52:23,351
TRAVIS: You got distracted, you're left behind.

1526
01:52:23,351 --> 01:52:24,478
LAURA: Yeah, but--

1527
01:52:24,478 --> 01:52:29,922
TALIESIN: You've found it. I'll tell you what you
did find. You found a Playstation VR system. But

1528
01:52:29,922 --> 01:52:31,251
<i>very</i> used.

1529
01:52:31,251 --> 01:52:34,261
LIAM: You're getting pink eye from that.

1530
01:52:34,261 --> 01:52:37,559
LAURA: Do you know how you get pink eye?

1531
01:52:37,559 --> 01:52:42,823
TALIESIN: It was already a little iffy, but it's
definitely not been happy for the past however

1532
01:52:42,823 --> 01:52:44,008
long it has been.

1533
01:52:44,008 --> 01:52:45,363
LIAM: Poop in the eye, yeah?

1534
01:52:45,363 --> 01:52:47,084
TALIESIN: Like Lucky Charms.

1535
01:52:47,084 --> 01:52:49,756
LIAM: What's Travis doing right now?

1536
01:52:49,756 --> 01:52:57,027
TALIESIN: He was wandering-- he went into the
corner, to Elise's desk and he found underneath

1537
01:52:57,027 --> 01:53:05,079
her desk something that will do. It's a replica
knife that seems to be pretty solid. It's a Lord

1538
01:53:05,079 --> 01:53:10,637
of the Rings replica elf knife. It's not exactly
sharp, but it will do the trick.

1539
01:53:10,637 --> 01:53:16,473
LIAM: I catch up, put my hand on your shoulder.
That is sick. And I'm sorry and I use Presence:

1540
01:53:16,473 --> 01:53:20,475
Awe to say, you really need to keep me safe so I
can get us out of here.

1541
01:53:20,475 --> 01:53:21,786
TALIESIN: Oh, you're going for that?

1542
01:53:21,786 --> 01:53:22,705
LIAM: Yes.

1543
01:53:22,705 --> 01:53:24,100
TALIESIN: All right. Roll a d10.

1544
01:53:24,100 --> 01:53:26,583
LIAM: Okay. Just one. So it's not charisma plus
persuasion?

1545
01:53:26,583 --> 01:53:33,491
TALIESIN: We're doing that next. Roll a d10. Okay.
So what's your roll? I mean, what's your--

1546
01:53:33,491 --> 01:53:37,409
LIAM: Charisma and persuasion.

1547
01:53:37,409 --> 01:53:39,128
TALIESIN: And it's just straight-up?

1548
01:53:39,128 --> 01:53:41,478
LIAM: That's what it says. Hunger or charisma plus
persuasion.

1549
01:53:41,478 --> 01:53:44,001
TALIESIN: Let me double check just because I'm
learning how these powers work.

1550
01:53:44,001 --> 01:53:46,789
SAM: Where are you?

1551
01:53:46,789 --> 01:53:49,175
TALIESIN: I know. I'll find it.

1552
01:53:49,175 --> 01:53:52,971
LAURA: I'm just playing with the Pink Eye system.

1553
01:53:52,971 --> 01:53:56,158
LIAM: This is the scariest thing yet.

1554
01:53:56,158 --> 01:54:02,143
SAM: Are you putting it on your face? It could
protect your eyes.

1555
01:54:02,143 --> 01:54:03,743
TALIESIN: And what's your roll for that? Four?

1556
01:54:03,743 --> 01:54:05,196
LIAM: I rolled a four on the d10.

1557
01:54:05,196 --> 01:54:09,940
TALIESIN: Make a intelligence versus willpower
roll.

1558
01:54:09,940 --> 01:54:11,770
TRAVIS: So what's the versus mean?

1559
01:54:11,770 --> 01:54:14,724
TALIESIN: Oh. Just intelligence and willpower.

1560
01:54:14,724 --> 01:54:19,144
LIAM: A single d10 or-- so I roll too? Charisma
plus persuasion?

1561
01:54:19,144 --> 01:54:22,751
TALIESIN: Yeah, you roll that. Charisma plus
persuasion. I'm making this a versus because

1562
01:54:22,751 --> 01:54:24,527
normally, it's not. But this is weird.

1563
01:54:24,527 --> 01:54:39,241
TRAVIS: So this is the intelligence one. And
that's two successes and the willpower is two

1564
01:54:39,241 --> 01:54:42,427
successes. And a failure, but not a red.

1565
01:54:42,427 --> 01:54:43,970
LIAM: Two successes.

1566
01:54:43,970 --> 01:54:46,995
TALIESIN: Two success. Do you want to burn a
willpower to reroll?

1567
01:54:46,995 --> 01:54:48,022
LIAM: Yes.

1568
01:54:48,022 --> 01:54:50,367
TALIESIN: Reroll everything you don't like and
burn a willpower.

1569
01:54:50,367 --> 01:54:51,683
TRAVIS: It's four successes.

1570
01:54:51,683 --> 01:54:53,174
LIAM: Five successes.

1571
01:54:53,174 --> 01:54:56,573
SAM: Oh! You got to mark off that willpower.

1572
01:54:56,573 --> 01:55:08,386
TALIESIN: He's your bro, man. And also, take an
extra die. You're here to keep everybody safe but you're--

1573
01:55:08,386 --> 01:55:17,347
TRAVIS: Hey man. You are actually the person I'm
most concerned about, so you stay close to me. I'll

1574
01:55:17,347 --> 01:55:18,709
keep you safe.

1575
01:55:18,709 --> 01:55:25,516
LIAM: Everyone here, I don't know why, likes me.
I'm an idiot, but they do. So you keep me alive,

1576
01:55:25,516 --> 01:55:28,517
obviously. So you keep <i>me</i> alive.

1577
01:55:28,517 --> 01:55:30,477
TRAVIS: Look what I found!

1578
01:55:30,477 --> 01:55:32,247
LAURA: I'm playing Resident Evil.

1579
01:55:32,247 --> 01:55:33,437
TALIESIN: On the VR?

1580
01:55:33,437 --> 01:55:34,451
LAURA: Yeah.

1581
01:55:34,451 --> 01:55:36,583
TALIESIN: I think I was going to have you roll to
see if you get pink eye, but never mind.

1582
01:55:36,583 --> 01:55:38,897
LIAM:That's an auto-fail.

1583
01:55:38,897 --> 01:55:46,634
TALIESIN: I feel so bad, I'm so mean to Nerdist.
Nothing of event walking through here.

1584
01:55:46,634 --> 01:55:47,827
TRAVIS: Through the Nerdist office? Nothing?

1585
01:55:47,827 --> 01:55:49,049
TALIESIN: Nothing weird.

1586
01:55:49,049 --> 01:55:51,584
TRAVIS: Let's go. Let's keep going. To the Twitch
stage.

1587
01:55:51,584 --> 01:55:56,747
TALIESIN: You're at the door. There's the big
circle. You're in the kitchen again. There's the

1588
01:55:56,747 --> 01:56:00,726
big circle on the floor and there's the bloody
sign on the big door.

1589
01:56:00,726 --> 01:56:06,606
LAURA: Oh my god! The farmer jumped out! Oh, you
guys, have you played this? Oh my god, you guys!

1590
01:56:06,606 --> 01:56:08,811
SAM: Is this a portable system? How does this
work?

1591
01:56:08,811 --> 01:56:09,953
TALIESIN: No, it's--

1592
01:56:09,953 --> 01:56:11,018
TRAVIS: Wired.

1593
01:56:11,018 --> 01:56:14,966
LAURA: I already took it off, dick. And you're in
the kitchen.

1594
01:56:14,966 --> 01:56:18,290
TALIESIN: The funniest thing of course is there's
prob-- well no, I guess there would be a little

1595
01:56:18,290 --> 01:56:19,872
power to it. It's probably pretty glitchy.

1596
01:56:19,872 --> 01:56:27,671
TRAVIS: It doesn't really work. None of the
laptops worked. You were playing with nothing.

1597
01:56:27,671 --> 01:56:29,160
LAURA: I'm crazy!

1598
01:56:29,160 --> 01:56:35,837
TALIESIN: So yeah, you get to the stage again and
big red letters that says, "I was born in a box.

1599
01:56:35,837 --> 01:56:37,079
"How do I end?"

1600
01:56:37,079 --> 01:56:40,470
TRAVIS: Okay, this is obviously some sort of
puzzle, right?

1601
01:56:40,470 --> 01:56:46,346
SAM: This is a riddle, this is a puzzle. We've got
three clues so far. I was born in a box. How do I end?

1602
01:56:46,346 --> 01:56:48,919
LIAM: Well, Matt ended and Marisha ended.

1603
01:56:48,919 --> 01:56:52,089
SAM: Something is wrong. Right, that was the
first thing that we read.

1604
01:56:52,089 --> 01:56:54,567
LAURA: Hey guys, thanks for leaving me behind in
the Nerdist--

1605
01:56:54,567 --> 01:56:56,689
SAM: Is it something is the matter or something is
wrong?

1606
01:56:56,689 --> 01:56:58,437
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Something is wrong.

1607
01:56:58,437 --> 01:57:01,894
SAM: And then also, your funeral. This is a word
scramble.

1608
01:57:01,894 --> 01:57:05,528
LAURA: Well, your funeral is obviously referring
to if you go through the curtain, you're dead.

1609
01:57:05,528 --> 01:57:10,336
TALIESIN: Make an intelligence test. No, just
Sam.

1610
01:57:10,336 --> 01:57:14,037
SAM: Okay. In just a straight--

1611
01:57:14,037 --> 01:57:15,077
TALIESIN: Straight intelligence test.

1612
01:57:15,077 --> 01:57:16,036
SAM: --straight stanima.

1613
01:57:16,036 --> 01:57:20,636
TALIESIN: No, straight intelligence test, you
fucker. I have your stats here.

1614
01:57:20,636 --> 01:57:22,460
SAM: Two successes.

1615
01:57:22,460 --> 01:57:26,045
TALIESIN: Okay. You know me, I've been busy all
week. This is not a word scramble. I don't have

1616
01:57:26,045 --> 01:57:27,651
time for that shit.

1617
01:57:27,651 --> 01:57:29,525
TRAVIS: I would high-five you right now.

1618
01:57:29,525 --> 01:57:30,701
TALIESIN: Thank you.

1619
01:57:30,701 --> 01:57:32,254
LAURA: I was born in a box. How do I end?

1620
01:57:32,254 --> 01:57:35,132
TALIESIN: And there is a circle on the floor.

1621
01:57:35,132 --> 01:57:36,880
LAURA: Oh, and it's got--

1622
01:57:36,880 --> 01:57:40,181
TRAVIS: A heart, a sun, a face, a cross in a
circle.

1623
01:57:40,181 --> 01:57:43,671
TALIESIN: Or a head, or a face.

1624
01:57:43,671 --> 01:57:53,748
LAURA: How do I end? I was born in a box. How do I
end? You end from the sun! So I'm going to stand

1625
01:57:53,748 --> 01:57:55,230
in the sun.

1626
01:57:55,230 --> 01:57:56,789
SAM and LIAM: What?

1627
01:57:56,789 --> 01:57:58,753
TRAVIS: In the circle or--

1628
01:57:58,753 --> 01:58:00,877
TALIESIN: I followed you. Nothing happens.

1629
01:58:00,877 --> 01:58:08,525
LAURA: Oh. Maybe the cross, too, a wooden
stake situation? Can't you die from a cross if

1630
01:58:08,525 --> 01:58:09,531
you're a vampire?

1631
01:58:09,531 --> 01:58:10,609
TRAVIS: If you're a vampire, yeah.

1632
01:58:10,609 --> 01:58:12,689
LAURA: Aren't we vampires? Look at my teeth!

1633
01:58:12,689 --> 01:58:14,584
TRAVIS: Those are a problem.

1634
01:58:14,584 --> 01:58:16,483
SAM: Who gets born in a box?

1635
01:58:16,483 --> 01:58:18,939
LAURA: We did! Coffins, dude.

1636
01:58:18,939 --> 01:58:20,392
TRAVIS: Test-tube babies?

1637
01:58:20,392 --> 01:58:24,150
TALIESIN: They were born from a tube. Sorry.

1638
01:58:24,150 --> 01:58:27,780
SAM: Was Jesus Christ born in a box? A manger
thing?

1639
01:58:27,780 --> 01:58:32,711
LAURA: No, <i>we</i> were born in a box.

1640
01:58:32,711 --> 01:58:34,703
TALIESIN: How much you overestimate me.

1641
01:58:34,703 --> 01:58:38,192
TRAVIS: When she stood in the sun, did anything
happen?

1642
01:58:38,192 --> 01:58:39,291
TALIESIN: No.

1643
01:58:39,291 --> 01:58:44,094
TRAVIS: Why don't you take the stake that we were
given and stab the heart with it?

1644
01:58:44,094 --> 01:58:49,081
LAURA: Okay. I take the wooden stake and stab the
heart on the ground.

1645
01:58:49,081 --> 01:58:54,324
TALIESIN: When you put the stake on the ground
by the heart, there's this low, bassy thud.

1646
01:58:54,324 --> 01:59:00,937
LAURA: Should I leave it here or should I back
up? What should I do?

1647
01:59:00,937 --> 01:59:03,257
SAM: That's a good thing. No, this is progress.

1648
01:59:03,257 --> 01:59:05,111
LAURA: Should I leave it on the ground or should I--

1649
01:59:05,111 --> 01:59:06,148
SAM: Sure.

1650
01:59:06,148 --> 01:59:07,749
LAURA: I'll leave the stake on the ground.

1651
01:59:07,749 --> 01:59:15,101
TALIESIN: The blood that the heart was drawn with
start to turn black and crackle. And it boils

1652
01:59:15,101 --> 01:59:17,012
there, gently.

1653
01:59:17,012 --> 01:59:21,855
TRAVIS: Okay. So heart and stake. Not cohesive.

1654
01:59:21,855 --> 01:59:26,231
LAURA: Very cohesive. It killed the heart.

1655
01:59:26,231 --> 01:59:28,386
TRAVIS and LAURA: Yeah.

1656
01:59:28,386 --> 01:59:33,201
LAURA: Are there any more clues around? Do we see
any more writing?

1657
01:59:33,201 --> 01:59:34,577
TALIESIN: This is a big building.

1658
01:59:34,577 --> 01:59:35,698
TRAVIS: That's true.

1659
01:59:35,698 --> 01:59:42,053
LIAM: All right. There's no people out here,
right? The "drink me" and "eat me" people were all

1660
01:59:42,053 --> 01:59:44,937
back in the Nerdist offices, outside the
bullpen.

1661
01:59:44,937 --> 01:59:46,738
TALIESIN: You don't see anybody.

1662
01:59:46,738 --> 01:59:48,635
TRAVIS: Should we check the little prop closet?

1663
01:59:48,635 --> 01:59:51,905
LAURA: Let's see if the key card opens the prop
closet. Did it work?

1664
01:59:51,905 --> 01:59:57,636
TALIESIN: The keycard does in fact open the prop
closet. It's a very good keycard. That's better

1665
01:59:57,636 --> 02:00:00,848
than my keycard. Yeah, the prop closet opens.

1666
02:00:00,848 --> 02:00:02,393
LAURA: (gasps) Is there a weapon in here?

1667
02:00:02,393 --> 02:00:03,664
TRAVIS: Can we turn the light on?

1668
02:00:03,664 --> 02:00:05,486
TALIESIN: You can hit the switch.

1669
02:00:05,486 --> 02:00:06,499
TRAVIS: I hit the switch.

1670
02:00:06,499 --> 02:00:10,242
TALIESIN: Doesn't turn on. To be fair, you can see
okay. You don't see--

1671
02:00:10,242 --> 02:00:13,405
TRAVIS: I do have heightened senses.

1672
02:00:13,405 --> 02:00:17,952
TALIESIN: Especially if you want to burn a little
blood, you can see really well if you're looking

1673
02:00:17,952 --> 02:00:28,649
for something in particular, but it's the prop
closet. It's a ruined, dishevelled mess of

1674
02:00:28,649 --> 02:00:35,738
ephemera, toys, prop weapons, costumes. It's
exactly the way you remember it.

1675
02:00:35,738 --> 02:00:38,045
TRAVIS: Do I smell anything coming from this
room?

1676
02:00:38,045 --> 02:00:41,272
TALIESIN: Yes, but it is the same smell it's always
had, which has been very iffy.

1677
02:00:41,272 --> 02:00:46,193
TRAVIS: Nothing tasty or spicy or interesting? I
mean, spicy is the wrong word. It's always spicy

1678
02:00:46,193 --> 02:00:47,153
in there.

1679
02:00:47,153 --> 02:00:49,568
TALIESIN: I don't know. It's whatever you really
imagine, the wonderful--

1680
02:00:49,568 --> 02:00:51,993
TRAVIS: Does it smell delicious?

1681
02:00:51,993 --> 02:00:55,343
TALIESIN: There's obviously some rats living in
here, if you went diving for them.

1682
02:00:55,343 --> 02:01:01,333
LAURA: Can we look for rats? I need a rat. I want
to eat a rat again. It was really good.

1683
02:01:01,333 --> 02:01:02,925
TALIESIN: It was pretty good.

1684
02:01:02,925 --> 02:01:04,719
LAURA: I'm serious.

1685
02:01:04,719 --> 02:01:06,160
SAM: All right. I'll try to look for a rat with
her.

1686
02:01:06,160 --> 02:01:09,238
TALIESIN: All right. Do a perception
investigation.

1687
02:01:09,238 --> 02:01:15,527
LIAM: Can I go back? I forgot something that I
wanted to do. Back at the office, inside the

1688
02:01:15,527 --> 02:01:16,680
bullpen.

1689
02:01:16,680 --> 02:01:18,644
TRAVIS: You guys are okay here looking for rats,
right? I'm going to go with Liam.

1690
02:01:18,644 --> 02:01:20,157
TALIESIN: You can take a look.

1691
02:01:20,157 --> 02:01:22,433
SAM: Only one success and one failure with the red
dice.

1692
02:01:22,433 --> 02:01:25,852
TALIESIN: You find a rubber rat and you bite it.

1693
02:01:25,852 --> 02:01:28,187
LAURA: Three successes for me.

1694
02:01:28,187 --> 02:01:33,637
TALIESIN: I'm personally a fan of the taste of
rubber rats. I think it's nice and the texture's

1695
02:01:33,637 --> 02:01:39,097
pretty positive but your tooth gets a little
weird. It doesn't feel right.

1696
02:01:39,097 --> 02:01:40,685
LAURA: Three successes.

1697
02:01:40,685 --> 02:01:48,920
TALIESIN: Three successes? Ooh, that's pretty
solid. You do in fact find a rat hiding behind one

1698
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:57,007
of the costume bins and if you want to tear for it,
you got to give me a dex melee or dex brawl. Roll

1699
02:01:57,007 --> 02:01:58,220
for it.

1700
02:01:58,220 --> 02:01:59,489
LAURA: I'll do a dex brawl.

1701
02:01:59,489 --> 02:02:04,224
TALIESIN: All right. Punch that rat. Where are you
guys going?

1702
02:02:04,224 --> 02:02:08,948
LIAM: I'm back at the office, outside the bullpen
where the door was shut. Who all's wearing

1703
02:02:08,948 --> 02:02:11,173
these signs? It was Arcade--

1704
02:02:11,173 --> 02:02:13,342
TALIESIN and TRAVIS: Chris, Arcade.

1705
02:02:13,342 --> 02:02:16,283
TALIESIN: Audrey was there. Max was there. A
couple of people.

1706
02:02:16,283 --> 02:02:17,554
LAURA: Just one success.

1707
02:02:17,554 --> 02:02:20,228
TALIESIN: It's a rat. I'll let you have it for
one.

1708
02:02:20,228 --> 02:02:23,139
LAURA: Can I share it with Sam, though?

1709
02:02:23,139 --> 02:02:24,751
TALIESIN: No.

1710
02:02:24,751 --> 02:02:27,429
LAURA: I have to eat the rat all myself? Okay, I
eat the rat.

1711
02:02:27,429 --> 02:02:28,876
TALIESIN: How many red dice do you have?

1712
02:02:28,876 --> 02:02:29,955
LAURA: Just one.

1713
02:02:29,955 --> 02:02:31,013
TALIESIN: It doesn't go away.

1714
02:02:31,013 --> 02:02:32,706
LIAM: And the sign says what again?

1715
02:02:32,706 --> 02:02:34,308
TALIESIN: Drink me.

1716
02:02:34,308 --> 02:02:38,707
LAURA: I tried, I wanted to but it's such a little
rat. (slurps)

1717
02:02:38,707 --> 02:02:42,731
SAM: I'd say you're dead to me, but--

1718
02:02:42,731 --> 02:02:46,120
LIAM: Don't judge. I bite Arcade's neck.

1719
02:02:46,120 --> 02:02:47,934
TRAVIS and LAURA: (gasping)

1720
02:02:47,934 --> 02:02:49,625
TALIESIN: He's going to try and fight you off.

1721
02:02:49,625 --> 02:02:52,464
LAURA: You're going to suck Arcade's blood?

1722
02:02:52,464 --> 02:02:53,786
LIAM: I am.

1723
02:02:53,786 --> 02:02:57,958
TALIESIN: He starts to panic and as it is
happening, he's going to fight you off.

1724
02:02:57,958 --> 02:03:02,688
LIAM: I use Dread Gaze and inspire unbearable
immobility.

1725
02:03:02,688 --> 02:03:05,208
TALIESIN: What's the roll on that?

1726
02:03:05,208 --> 02:03:09,954
LIAM: Charisma plus intimidation versus charisma
and willpower.

1727
02:03:09,954 --> 02:03:20,051
TALIESIN: All right. Give me charisma
intimidation. And my charisma willpower for my

1728
02:03:20,051 --> 02:03:21,587
humans. There we are.

1729
02:03:21,587 --> 02:03:31,084
LIAM: And failure is a one. So one success. No
failures.

1730
02:03:31,084 --> 02:03:34,259
TALIESIN: He's not frozen. He's hiding in the
corner.

1731
02:03:34,259 --> 02:03:38,209
LIAM: Okay. I grab a couple of t-shirts and I
push--

1732
02:03:38,209 --> 02:03:39,457
TALIESIN: Which t-shirts?

1733
02:03:39,457 --> 02:03:42,645
LIAM: The StayTurnt t-shirt and the Dungeon Master
t-shirt.

1734
02:03:42,645 --> 02:03:43,914
TALIESIN: Thank you for being respectful.

1735
02:03:43,914 --> 02:03:50,766
LIAM: And I cover his hands up and I say: Can you
just give into it? You know, this is terrible for

1736
02:03:50,766 --> 02:03:51,850
both of us.

1737
02:03:51,850 --> 02:03:53,623
TALIESIN: There's a single tear.

1738
02:03:53,623 --> 02:03:55,495
LIAM: I know. But it will all be over soon.

1739
02:03:55,495 --> 02:03:58,914
TRAVIS: I'm standing behind Liam, holding the prop
knife to the rest of the room. Is there anybody

1740
02:03:58,914 --> 02:04:00,082
moving towards Liam?

1741
02:04:00,082 --> 02:04:05,341
TALIESIN: No. I get the distinct impression this
has already happened. They know what's going down.

1742
02:04:05,341 --> 02:04:08,999
LIAM: I mean, we're through the looking glass
here, Arcade. I'm really sorry, but I'm going to

1743
02:04:08,999 --> 02:04:10,229
try to bite him again.

1744
02:04:10,229 --> 02:04:12,851
TALIESIN: Are you going to go for a bite?

1745
02:04:12,851 --> 02:04:13,678
LIAM: Yes, please.

1746
02:04:13,678 --> 02:04:28,395
TALIESIN: Give me a strength brawl. Let me
double-check. Hold on. Actually, strength brawl

1747
02:04:28,395 --> 02:04:29,731
plus two.

1748
02:04:29,731 --> 02:04:37,597
LIAM: Strength brawl? Brawl's nothing. So strength
brawl plus two. Okay, it's not good. I got a fail!

1749
02:04:37,597 --> 02:04:39,375
LAURA: You got two fails, yo!

1750
02:04:39,375 --> 02:04:41,575
LIAM: Two fails! One on the red.

1751
02:04:41,575 --> 02:04:49,839
TALIESIN: One on the red. He manages to just
barely fight you off. He's hidden under the desk

1752
02:04:49,839 --> 02:04:51,183
now. He's trying to crawl away.

1753
02:04:51,183 --> 02:04:52,219
TRAVIS: What are you doing?

1754
02:04:52,219 --> 02:04:53,642
LIAM: Fuck it. I whip around and turn on Chris.

1755
02:04:53,642 --> 02:04:59,246
TALIESIN: Give me a strength brawl plus two.

1756
02:04:59,246 --> 02:05:00,887
TRAVIS: Are we eating people? What's happening?

1757
02:05:00,887 --> 02:05:03,076
LAURA: He's giving in to it.

1758
02:05:03,076 --> 02:05:05,667
LIAM: That's better. That's two successes.

1759
02:05:05,667 --> 02:05:16,870
TALIESIN: All right. You get one point back. You
lose one. Do you want to go any further? Keep

1760
02:05:16,870 --> 02:05:18,361
drinking or do you want to--

1761
02:05:18,361 --> 02:05:20,167
LIAM: Yeah.

1762
02:05:20,167 --> 02:05:22,778
LAURA: (gasps) You can't get rid of your other
one!

1763
02:05:22,778 --> 02:05:24,098
LIAM: You can't get rid of the other one?

1764
02:05:24,098 --> 02:05:26,128
TALIESIN: I'm sure there's a way to do it.

1765
02:05:26,128 --> 02:05:33,432
LIAM: So you always keep one? If I'm okay-ish,
I'll hold off. I'll see you later, though.

1766
02:05:33,432 --> 02:05:40,584
TALIESIN: He's now bleeding from the neck. As he
goes back to his-- not pouring, but bleeding.

1767
02:05:40,584 --> 02:05:43,468
TRAVIS: Is there a little coagulant in Liam's
spit, at least?

1768
02:05:43,468 --> 02:05:45,149
LIAM: But everybody likes me here, Travis.

1769
02:05:45,149 --> 02:05:46,931
TRAVIS: I know they do.

1770
02:05:46,931 --> 02:05:50,578
TALIESIN: Are you backing out of the room now to
join the rest?

1771
02:05:50,578 --> 02:05:54,775
LIAM: Is there any other weapon-y stuff in the
room?

1772
02:05:54,775 --> 02:05:56,501
TALIESIN: Not that you can see.

1773
02:05:56,501 --> 02:05:58,405
LIAM: Is there anything ridiculous like--

1774
02:05:58,405 --> 02:06:00,701
TALIESIN: You've seen that office. Everything's
ridiculous.

1775
02:06:00,701 --> 02:06:04,749
LIAM: Yeah. All right.

1776
02:06:04,749 --> 02:06:08,275
LAURA: I'm looking for a weapon in the prop closet
with the rats.

1777
02:06:08,275 --> 02:06:11,535
SAM: I'm helping her and while we're looking I'm
telling her--

1778
02:06:11,535 --> 02:06:15,515
TALIESIN: Perception investigation. You can
combine your roll if you like.

1779
02:06:15,515 --> 02:06:18,268
LIAM: I swing past the office supplies and grab a
fistful of pencils.

1780
02:06:18,268 --> 02:06:25,110
TALIESIN: Good call. Perception investigation. As
you walk by, you see Dani come walking through the

1781
02:06:25,110 --> 02:06:33,713
office. She smiles, walks by. You see her go into
the office and she says, "Chris, we need you to

1782
02:06:33,713 --> 02:06:39,833
"help update the server. Come on." And then she
walks by, carrying the bleeding Chris over to the

1783
02:06:39,833 --> 02:06:41,088
server room.

1784
02:06:41,088 --> 02:06:42,241
LAURA: What were you going to say, Sam?

1785
02:06:42,241 --> 02:06:49,250
SAM: I'm was going to say, I'm feeling very
vulnerable. Why don't we form an alliance and if

1786
02:06:49,250 --> 02:06:57,790
anything goes down, we kick Liam down and we'll
run away as fast as we can.

1787
02:06:57,790 --> 02:06:59,912
LAURA: But we'll also make sure--

1788
02:06:59,912 --> 02:07:02,559
TALIESIN: Sam, do you-- No. I'm just waving this.

1789
02:07:02,559 --> 02:07:04,562
LIAM: You also have no idea that I just drained
Chris' neck.

1790
02:07:04,562 --> 02:07:06,510
LAURA: We'll make sure Travis is okay.

1791
02:07:06,510 --> 02:07:11,129
SAM: Of course. Yes. But Liam's a goner.

1792
02:07:11,129 --> 02:07:23,640
LAURA: I mean, he's a pretty fast runner. I'm
probably the slowest out of all of us. I got two tens.

1793
02:07:23,640 --> 02:07:32,074
TALIESIN: Two tens. That's a critical. That is a
critical. You have found some World of Warcraft

1794
02:07:32,074 --> 02:07:38,055
prop swords. See, I did know where they were. I
did. There were right here. I know you're not

1795
02:07:38,055 --> 02:07:44,685
watching, Marisha. I knew where they were. You
found some prop stakes, but to be fair, a prop

1796
02:07:44,685 --> 02:07:48,150
stake is still a piece of wood. That's still
stake-y.

1797
02:07:48,150 --> 02:07:49,356
LAURA: How many stakes?

1798
02:07:49,356 --> 02:07:56,493
TALIESIN: You found two stakes and you found a
very weird silver chalice. It's

1799
02:07:56,493 --> 02:07:59,960
interesting-looking. Could be something. Could be
nothing. No idea.

1800
02:07:59,960 --> 02:08:03,508
LAURA: I stick that in my belt like I would at a
Ren Faire.

1801
02:08:03,508 --> 02:08:05,630
TALIESIN: Ren-Faire style.

1802
02:08:05,630 --> 02:08:10,654
LAURA: Yeah. Did I find a World of Warcraft weapon
too?

1803
02:08:10,654 --> 02:08:13,469
TALISIN: Yeah. It's a big ridiculous sword that
would hang on a wall.

1804
02:08:13,469 --> 02:08:15,565
LAURA: Whoa. Is it made of metal?

1805
02:08:15,565 --> 02:08:16,941
TALIESIN: It's made out of a metal.

1806
02:08:16,941 --> 02:08:18,682
LAURA: This is way too heavy for me.

1807
02:08:18,682 --> 02:08:22,499
TALIESIN: Actually, what's your strength?

1808
02:08:22,499 --> 02:08:24,365
LAURA: Two.

1809
02:08:24,365 --> 02:08:31,383
TALIESIN: That's pretty good. That's a 110 pound--
that's a normal human. You're not quite

1810
02:08:31,383 --> 02:08:35,339
supernatural, but you could be fine with it.

1811
02:08:35,339 --> 02:08:36,709
LAURA: Yeah?

1812
02:08:36,709 --> 02:08:41,112
TRAVIS: So Liam and I make our way out. Are we
sharing with the others what just happened?

1813
02:08:41,112 --> 02:08:42,579
LAURA and SAM: What just happened?

1814
02:08:42,579 --> 02:08:44,000
LIAM: That's a bad idea.

1815
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:45,148
LAURA: What was it?

1816
02:08:45,148 --> 02:08:47,949
TRAVIS: We canvassed the offices and found--

1817
02:08:47,949 --> 02:08:50,918
LIAM: Well, we wanted to find more weapons.

1818
02:08:50,918 --> 02:08:53,372
TRAVIS: Yeah, I found this dagger! It's not super
sharp, but--

1819
02:08:53,372 --> 02:08:54,445
SAM: I found a sword!

1820
02:08:54,445 --> 02:08:55,450
LIAM: I got a bunch of pencils.

1821
02:08:55,450 --> 02:08:59,231
LAURA: Look at this big-ass sword I found! Do you
want to switch me?

1822
02:08:59,231 --> 02:09:01,176
LIAM: Maybe other people are vampires like us.

1823
02:09:01,176 --> 02:09:02,684
LAURA: I'll take the dagger and you take the giant
sword?

1824
02:09:02,684 --> 02:09:03,986
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1825
02:09:03,986 --> 02:09:06,247
LAURA: Okay. All right.

1826
02:09:06,247 --> 02:09:10,893
TALIESIN: It's a good dagger. It's the S-curled one,
it's got the nice little--

1827
02:09:10,893 --> 02:09:13,128
LAURA: This is really badass.

1828
02:09:13,128 --> 02:09:16,519
LIAM: My internal monologue right now is really
pissed off that I did not get to taste Arcade.

1829
02:09:16,519 --> 02:09:22,476
TALIESIN: I know. You know, there's still time.
Things can still get weird. We'll see.

1830
02:09:22,476 --> 02:09:24,081
TRAVIS: Did you find anything out about the
puzzle?

1831
02:09:24,081 --> 02:09:27,239
LAURA: Oh shit. I forgot we were trying to solve a
puzzle.

1832
02:09:27,239 --> 02:09:33,150
SAM: Why don't we all look for puzzle clues? Or
should we try to do more to the-- that circle on

1833
02:09:33,150 --> 02:09:35,457
the ground, Taliesin. How big is it?

1834
02:09:35,457 --> 02:09:38,975
TALIESIN: It's slightly smaller than a children's
four-square court.

1835
02:09:38,975 --> 02:09:42,756
SAM: Big enough that if it opened, we could fit
through it?

1836
02:09:42,756 --> 02:09:51,808
TALIESIN: It's bled up into the door. It feels
like it's some sort of seal against the door

1837
02:09:51,808 --> 02:09:52,846
itself.

1838
02:09:52,846 --> 02:09:57,793
TRAVIS: Ooh! Wait a minute. Mercer died by the
sun, right? Don't we have his ashes in the Power

1839
02:09:57,793 --> 02:10:03,420
Rangers helmet? I pour the ashes of Mercer onto
the sun square.

1840
02:10:03,420 --> 02:10:12,254
TALIESIN: That's really fascinating. The ashes
start to mix with-- can't believe you did that. So

1841
02:10:12,254 --> 02:10:17,740
frustrated. The ashes start to mix with the sun
symbol and it starts to boil.

1842
02:10:17,740 --> 02:10:23,187
LAURA: Wait, Marisha died by mushrooms.

1843
02:10:23,187 --> 02:10:29,899
SAM: We could put some mushrooms on the head?

1844
02:10:29,899 --> 02:10:34,501
TALIESIN: Well, you didn't bring any of the
mushrooms because they looked a little--

1845
02:10:34,501 --> 02:10:37,330
LAURA: He probably still has some on his skin!

1846
02:10:37,330 --> 02:10:38,934
TALIESIN: He doesn't. He wiped them off.

1847
02:10:38,934 --> 02:10:42,769
SAM: What would heads not like? Wait, suns cause
ashes--

1848
02:10:42,769 --> 02:10:44,342
LAURA: Silver! Do we have any silver?

1849
02:10:44,342 --> 02:10:46,289
SAM: We just found a sword. What if the sword
is--

1850
02:10:46,289 --> 02:10:47,544
TRAVIS: Silver chalice. You have the silver
chalice.

1851
02:10:47,544 --> 02:10:48,673
LAURA: Oh shit.

1852
02:10:48,673 --> 02:10:50,537
TRAVIS: Holy fuck. Take notes.

1853
02:10:50,537 --> 02:10:54,460
LAURA: I did! I had silver chalice written down. I
thought I could drink out of it.

1854
02:10:54,460 --> 02:10:56,466
SAM: But would silver hurt a head?

1855
02:10:56,466 --> 02:10:57,790
LAURA: Well, you could hit it.

1856
02:10:57,790 --> 02:10:59,508
TRAVIS: Plus, Matt Key's head was in the office.

1857
02:10:59,508 --> 02:11:04,495
LAURA: Silver is bad for vamp-- does this hurt to
hold?

1858
02:11:04,495 --> 02:11:08,640
TRAVIS: I don't see any other clear connections.
How about we continue reconning the bottom of this

1859
02:11:08,640 --> 02:11:10,855
floor? So who's going to take the audio booth?

1860
02:11:10,855 --> 02:11:13,040
SAM: There's an audio booth here?

1861
02:11:13,040 --> 02:11:15,381
LAURA: Yeah! It's right over in the corner over
there, dude!

1862
02:11:15,381 --> 02:11:16,071
SAM: Really?

1863
02:11:16,071 --> 02:11:20,996
LIAM: Yeah, you just come from your car right to
this table, so there's a whole bunch of areas you don't

1864
02:11:21,081 --> 02:11:21,914
know about.

1865
02:11:21,914 --> 02:11:23,383
LAURA: I'm going to go in the back offices.

1866
02:11:23,383 --> 02:11:26,085
TRAVIS: You go in the very back, I'll take the
audio booth. Who wants the three bathrooms?

1867
02:11:26,085 --> 02:11:27,707
SAM: I know where the bathrooms are!

1868
02:11:27,707 --> 02:11:29,720
TALIESIN: My god, we've finally found a part
of--

1869
02:11:29,720 --> 02:11:32,906
TRAVIS: What are you going to go?

1870
02:11:32,906 --> 02:11:34,397
LIAM: I'll go with Sam, because we got to stick
together.

1871
02:11:34,397 --> 02:11:35,377
SAM: Always.

1872
02:11:35,377 --> 02:11:37,484
TRAVIS: I'm the closest, so I'll go into the
recording booth area.

1873
02:11:37,484 --> 02:11:39,033
LAURA: I'll be at the back, all by myself.

1874
02:11:39,033 --> 02:11:41,462
TALIESIN: The recording booth door is locked.

1875
02:11:41,462 --> 02:11:43,146
TRAVIS: Well, it's locked, so--

1876
02:11:43,146 --> 02:11:44,995
LAURA: You want to go to check out the back
offices with me?

1877
02:11:44,995 --> 02:11:46,347
SAM: You are huge!

1878
02:11:46,347 --> 02:11:48,896
LIAM: You can deadlift a house! You can't bust
that shit open?

1879
02:11:48,896 --> 02:11:54,017
TRAVIS: It's pretty solid with a fire door. Well,
let me try it. Can I back up and try to run

1880
02:11:54,017 --> 02:11:55,795
through the door?

1881
02:11:55,795 --> 02:12:04,567
TALIESIN: Yeah. You don't have anything fancy for
that. Do a strength athletics just for fun.

1882
02:12:04,567 --> 02:12:07,606
TRAVIS: So that loads me up pretty good.

1883
02:12:07,606 --> 02:12:10,592
TALIESIN: That's a tough door, though.

1884
02:12:10,592 --> 02:12:21,405
TRAVIS: That's a serious door. Yeah, it's no joke.
That is a ton of success. That's five successes

1885
02:12:21,405 --> 02:12:22,633
and no failures.

1886
02:12:22,633 --> 02:12:25,476
SAM: Whoa. Five successes, Taliesin.

1887
02:12:25,476 --> 02:12:33,525
TALIESIN: (sighs) Man, I was really hoping-- well,
it's okay. I honestly wanted that door to survive

1888
02:12:33,525 --> 02:12:35,873
because it's the most obnoxious door in the entire
building.

1889
02:12:35,873 --> 02:12:36,941
TRAVIS: It really is, yeah.

1890
02:12:36,941 --> 02:12:39,134
TALIESIN: It's the most obnoxious door in the
entire building. It's the only one the

1891
02:12:39,134 --> 02:12:46,356
keycard won't open. I don't know why. But that
door comes off its hinges and pops open.

1892
02:12:46,356 --> 02:12:47,321
LAURA: Holy crap!

1893
02:12:47,321 --> 02:12:49,370
SAM: Wow, CrossFit!

1894
02:12:49,370 --> 02:12:50,901
TRAVIS: Yeah, right?

1895
02:12:50,901 --> 02:12:52,892
TALIESIN: It goes flying off.

1896
02:12:52,892 --> 02:12:57,712
TRAVIS: In the doorway, with my heightened senses,
can I see anything in the darkened room?

1897
02:12:57,712 --> 02:13:08,504
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. In the darkened room, you can
see in the corner there's two Twitch hosts cuddled

1898
02:13:08,504 --> 02:13:12,213
up, hiding. They've been down there--

1899
02:13:12,213 --> 02:13:13,340
LAURA: Erika!

1900
02:13:13,340 --> 02:13:22,452
TALIESIN: No, it's not Erika. It appears to be Amy
Dallen and Jody Houser hiding in the corner. Jody

1901
02:13:22,452 --> 02:13:26,278
has been furiously scribbling because she's afraid
she still actually has a deadline if she ever

1902
02:13:26,278 --> 02:13:34,124
gets out of here. Amy Dallen has been slowly
building a little fort out of the computers to

1903
02:13:34,124 --> 02:13:37,523
stave off whatever it is that's been--

1904
02:13:37,523 --> 02:13:39,136
TRAVIS: Amy? Josie?

1905
02:13:39,136 --> 02:13:40,625
TALIESIN: Jody. Amy and Jody.

1906
02:13:40,625 --> 02:13:41,722
TRAVIS: Jody. Sorry.

1907
02:13:41,722 --> 02:13:43,447
TALIESIN: It's okay. I've been doing a lot of
Josie lately.

1908
02:13:43,447 --> 02:13:47,030
TRAVIS: Are you guys okay?

1909
02:13:47,030 --> 02:13:49,421
TALIESIN: "Travis?"

1910
02:13:49,421 --> 02:13:50,722
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1911
02:13:50,722 --> 02:13:55,839
TALIESIN: "It's not safe! Shut the-- oh."

1912
02:13:55,839 --> 02:13:57,212
TRAVIS: I broke the door.

1913
02:13:57,212 --> 02:14:01,841
TALIESIN: "There's things out there you don't--
oh, there's bad things out there."

1914
02:14:01,841 --> 02:14:03,795
TRAVIS: Can I come in the room?

1915
02:14:03,795 --> 02:14:06,497
TALIESIN: "Yeah. Of course."

1916
02:14:06,497 --> 02:14:10,178
TRAVIS: Okay. I walk in the room a little bit. I'm
still holding a giant sword.

1917
02:14:10,178 --> 02:14:12,401
SAM: He needs to be invited in. He's a vampire.

1918
02:14:12,401 --> 02:14:14,023
TALIESIN: You don't need to be invited in,
really.

1919
02:14:14,023 --> 02:14:15,434
TRAVIS: I don't? Oh shit.

1920
02:14:15,434 --> 02:14:17,532
TALIESIN: I'm glad you asked, though. It's very
polite.

1921
02:14:17,532 --> 02:14:19,805
TRAVIS: I was like, I know this fucking game!

1922
02:14:19,895 --> 02:14:22,119
LIAM: Let the right one in.

1923
02:14:22,119 --> 02:14:25,638
TRAVIS: Can I tuck the sword behind my back real
quick?

1924
02:14:25,638 --> 02:14:26,956
TALIESIN: Yeah, they saw it but--

1925
02:14:26,956 --> 02:14:29,224
TRAVIS: It's not for you.

1926
02:14:29,224 --> 02:14:32,842
TALIESIN: They're hip to what's going on and you
do not look like what they're afraid of. They're

1927
02:14:32,842 --> 02:14:33,820
not afraid of you yet.

1928
02:14:33,820 --> 02:14:35,226
TRAVIS: So I'm in the little engineering room,
right?

1929
02:14:35,226 --> 02:14:35,989
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1930
02:14:35,989 --> 02:14:40,520
TRAVIS: Is the booth clear? Is there anything in
there? You're sure?

1931
02:14:40,520 --> 02:14:44,189
TALIESIN: "Just food and drinks. That's all we've
just--"

1932
02:14:44,189 --> 02:14:49,278
TRAVIS: Do you mind if I look? Stay right where
you are. Please. Don't move. Can I walk over to

1933
02:14:49,278 --> 02:14:51,732
the door and look through and see what's in the
booth?

1934
02:14:51,732 --> 02:14:53,858
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. Nothing.

1935
02:14:53,858 --> 02:14:56,033
TRAVIS: Nothing? Not even food or drinks?

1936
02:14:56,033 --> 02:15:01,403
TALIESIN: No, I mean food and drink. They've got a
stash of-- they obviously raided a terrible

1937
02:15:01,403 --> 02:15:07,763
Nerdist shoot for Cheetos and whatever. And,
weirdly, yet another box of Lucky Charms. I don't

1938
02:15:07,763 --> 02:15:09,107
know why we have so many of them.

1939
02:15:09,107 --> 02:15:10,713
TRAVIS: Laura! Come in here!

1940
02:15:10,713 --> 02:15:12,984
LAURA: I'm already in the back office.

1941
02:15:12,984 --> 02:15:15,457
TRAVIS: Oh shit. Can anybody hear me?

1942
02:15:15,457 --> 02:15:17,606
TALIESIN: Does anybody--

1943
02:15:17,606 --> 02:15:19,263
SAM: We went to the bathroom.

1944
02:15:19,263 --> 02:15:22,632
TALIESIN: So depending on how loud you were, they
probably couldn't hear you.

1945
02:15:22,632 --> 02:15:23,678
TRAVIS: Yeah, that wasn't that loud.

1946
02:15:23,678 --> 02:15:26,161
LIAM: We might have faintly heard (muffled
noises).

1947
02:15:26,161 --> 02:15:28,955
TRAVIS: Can I try to open the booth door?

1948
02:15:28,955 --> 02:15:31,235
TALIESIN: Yeah, it opens just fine.

1949
02:15:31,235 --> 02:15:35,030
TRAVIS: Can I peek my head in and look behind the
door? Check the corners.

1950
02:15:35,030 --> 02:15:36,622
TALIESIN: Man! You are nervous!

1951
02:15:36,622 --> 02:15:38,049
TRAVIS: Just make sure it's food and drink.

1952
02:15:38,049 --> 02:15:41,726
TALIESIN: As far as you can tell, it's just food
and drink.

1953
02:15:41,726 --> 02:15:48,956
TRAVIS: Can I use my Aura Perception to see if
there is anything else in the room?

1954
02:15:48,956 --> 02:15:50,360
TALIESIN: What's the roll for that?

1955
02:15:50,360 --> 02:15:56,155
TRAVIS: It says hunger roll, perception plus
empathy minus manipulation plus willpower. No,

1956
02:15:56,155 --> 02:15:58,510
versus. Manipulation versus plus
willpower.

1957
02:15:58,510 --> 02:16:04,442
TALIESIN: Or a perception against people, I
believe. So who are you running it against? And

1958
02:16:04,490 --> 02:16:08,010
you can use it to figure out things like what
kind of creature someone is, you can get a

1959
02:16:08,081 --> 02:16:09,317
notion of how they're feeling.

1960
02:16:09,317 --> 02:16:14,120
TRAVIS: Let me get a notion of how Amy is
feeling since Jody is just writing.

1961
02:16:14,120 --> 02:16:17,195
TALIESIN: Yeah, Jody may have snapped a little.
It's tough to tell.

1962
02:16:17,195 --> 02:16:18,585
TRAVIS: She's on the other side.

1963
02:16:18,585 --> 02:16:26,765
TALIESIN: Sure. Make the roll and I'm going to use
my fancy rolls now because things are going to get

1964
02:16:26,765 --> 02:16:28,394
weird. Have a blood die.

1965
02:16:28,394 --> 02:16:31,042
TRAVIS: So I roll three of these, right?

1966
02:16:31,042 --> 02:16:34,680
TALIESIN: That one after. I think you get it next
roll.

1967
02:16:34,680 --> 02:16:41,682
TRAVIS: Three successes, no failures.

1968
02:16:41,682 --> 02:16:45,382
TALIESIN: Three successes, no failures? And what's
it versus for her?

1969
02:16:45,382 --> 02:16:47,432
TRAVIS: Manipulation plus willpower.

1970
02:16:47,432 --> 02:16:49,453
LIAM and LAURA: I don't like it!

1971
02:16:49,453 --> 02:16:52,180
TALIESIN: That is something you do hear, but it's
coming from somewhere.

1972
02:16:52,180 --> 02:16:54,037
LAURA: Oh god.

1973
02:16:54,037 --> 02:17:01,522
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. She's scared, but she's been
here for a while and it's tough to tell how long

1974
02:17:01,522 --> 02:17:08,423
and has gone into full fight-or-flight mode and has
definitely gone fight. And you definitely get the

1975
02:17:08,423 --> 02:17:13,947
sense that, and you can read this from her aura,
she is human and she has killed something within

1976
02:17:13,947 --> 02:17:18,028
the last 72 hours. You don't know what.

1977
02:17:18,028 --> 02:17:26,140
TRAVIS: Amy. I'm going to ask you to move back
into the booth until we can make sure it's more

1978
02:17:26,140 --> 02:17:30,679
safe. Can you tell me what you've seen and what
you were hiding from?

1979
02:17:30,679 --> 02:17:43,468
TALIESIN: (sighs) "There was a man. He was older. I
didn't recognize him and he came with people.

1980
02:17:43,468 --> 02:17:49,734
"There was some creature and something's wrong with
Ivan and--"

1981
02:17:49,734 --> 02:17:52,530
LAURA: We haven't even seen Ivan yet.

1982
02:17:52,530 --> 02:17:53,835
LIAM: Daddy Chops.

1983
02:17:53,835 --> 02:18:07,257
TALIESIN: "There was these things with these large
eyes and these vacant mouths and I fought one and

1984
02:18:07,257 --> 02:18:09,497
"then we've been hiding in here. I don't know how
long."

1985
02:18:09,497 --> 02:18:14,577
TRAVIS: We've seen the vacant eyes and mouths as
well. We put down two ourselves. They laughed

1986
02:18:14,577 --> 02:18:16,043
afterwards.

1987
02:18:16,043 --> 02:18:17,571
TALIESIN: "Yeah, they do that."

1988
02:18:17,571 --> 02:18:19,805
TRAVIS: That's really disturbing.

1989
02:18:19,805 --> 02:18:26,321
TALIESIN: "It is! I would say it's been a long
couple days, except I don't know how long it's been."

1990
02:18:26,321 --> 02:18:30,081
TRAVIS: Okay. I can't promise that it's safe
outside of this room and I'm sorry I broke the

1991
02:18:30,081 --> 02:18:32,185
door. Will you just wait inside the booth?

1992
02:18:32,185 --> 02:18:39,270
TALIESIN: "How about you put the door back and
we'll reinforce it and then knock seven times when

1993
02:18:39,270 --> 02:18:43,158
"the coast is clear because no one will knock seven
times, because that's ridiculous."

1994
02:18:43,158 --> 02:18:50,672
TRAVIS: That's my normal knock, but okay, that
sounds fair enough. Can I make a look around the

1995
02:18:50,672 --> 02:18:59,814
room before I leave for anything that might be
used as a weapon? It's pretty bare, right?

1996
02:18:59,814 --> 02:19:05,618
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's pretty bare. There's just the
desks and a decent rough cut of Thrashtopia

1997
02:19:05,618 --> 02:19:08,546
rolling on one of the monitors that's flickering.

1998
02:19:08,546 --> 02:19:12,502
TRAVIS: I'll pick up the door, back out of the
room and pull it back there with the handle.

1999
02:19:12,502 --> 02:19:15,915
TALIESIN: Good, man. Wow, that's a nice vampire.
That's good.

2000
02:19:15,915 --> 02:19:18,489
LAURA: He's not feeling it yet.

2001
02:19:18,489 --> 02:19:20,208
TALIESIN: Where are you at? Three?

2002
02:19:20,208 --> 02:19:21,158
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2003
02:19:21,158 --> 02:19:24,778
TALIESIN: All right. We'll see how we feel in a
minute. Cool.

2004
02:19:24,778 --> 02:19:27,455
LAURA: What happens if you get five hungers?

2005
02:19:27,455 --> 02:19:28,729
TRAVIS: That's a great question.

2006
02:19:28,729 --> 02:19:30,272
TALIESIN: That's a great question.

2007
02:19:30,272 --> 02:19:36,379
LAURA: I'm going to go back in the back office.
I'm going to use my Obfuscate.

2008
02:19:36,379 --> 02:19:38,487
TALIESIN: Because you have a second-level version,
right?

2009
02:19:38,487 --> 02:19:41,991
LAURA: That's right. So I can be totally
sneaky.

2010
02:19:41,991 --> 02:19:45,680
TALIESIN: You're going to be super sneaky. You're going
to burn a blood for that.

2011
02:19:45,680 --> 02:19:47,518
LAURA: Okay. What does that mean? I get another
blood?

2012
02:19:47,518 --> 02:19:49,700
TALIESIN: Roll a d10. What did you get?

2013
02:19:49,700 --> 02:19:50,502
LAURA: Two.

2014
02:19:50,502 --> 02:19:57,842
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, you get-- actually, this is not
the normal rolls. This is me doing terrible things

2015
02:19:57,842 --> 02:19:59,481
because this is a short game.

2016
02:19:59,481 --> 02:20:03,230
LAURA: I get two extra-- I'm so hungry all of a
sudden.

2017
02:20:03,230 --> 02:20:11,262
TALIESIN: You turned practically invisible, but it
cost you. So you're going all the way back?

2018
02:20:11,262 --> 02:20:15,613
LAURA: Past where we filmed the Slayers' Cake
thing.

2019
02:20:15,613 --> 02:20:16,890
TALIESIN: Past the library?

2020
02:20:16,890 --> 02:20:18,140
LAURA: Through to--

2021
02:20:18,140 --> 02:20:22,189
TALIESIN: Things start to get very weird back
there.

2022
02:20:22,189 --> 02:20:25,780
LAURA: I'm looking for writing, any clues I can
find.

2023
02:20:25,780 --> 02:20:44,210
TALIESIN: So as you turn the corner, the ground
starts to slowly get dark and strangely inky. That

2024
02:20:44,210 --> 02:20:49,508
whole office that you're used to seeing has been
cleared and is empty.

2025
02:20:49,508 --> 02:20:51,456
LAURA: There's nobody in here?

2026
02:20:51,456 --> 02:20:56,924
TALIESIN: There's a table in the middle of the
room. And in the darkness, you can't quite see the

2027
02:20:56,924 --> 02:21:05,522
walls. It's like you turned the corner and there's a
table, almost in a void. And at the table are four

2028
02:21:05,522 --> 02:21:16,268
people playing cards. It's Ivan. Ivan van Norman
is playing cards with Amy Vorpahl and Damion

2029
02:21:16,268 --> 02:21:23,509
Poitier and Sam. They're all sitting, playing
cards. Ivan--

2030
02:21:23,509 --> 02:21:25,384
SAM: Not me Sam. There's another Sam.

2031
02:21:25,384 --> 02:21:26,703
TALIESIN: No, the other Sam.

2032
02:21:26,703 --> 02:21:27,928
TRAVIS: Ivan, Amy, Damion--

2033
02:21:27,928 --> 02:21:35,526
TALIESIN: And Sam are playing cards. It's not a
game you recognize. Ivan's having a great time.

2034
02:21:35,526 --> 02:21:39,412
Everybody else looks a little nervous.

2035
02:21:39,412 --> 02:21:42,143
LAURA: Do they smell good?

2036
02:21:42,143 --> 02:21:43,882
TALIESIN: They do.

2037
02:21:43,882 --> 02:21:45,293
LAURA: Does Ivan smell good?

2038
02:21:45,293 --> 02:21:58,485
TALIESIN: Ivan smells pretty good, but Ivan smells
a little burnt and his hair is-- what is the most

2039
02:21:58,485 --> 02:22:03,184
terrifying thing I can say about hair? It's like
Yahoo Serious hair. That is the most terrifying.

2040
02:22:03,184 --> 02:22:10,081
Thank you. It's standing up like he's been
shocked, like he's been putting his tongue in a

2041
02:22:10,081 --> 02:22:11,035
socket.

2042
02:22:11,035 --> 02:22:12,420
LIAM: Is that true of his sideburns as well?

2043
02:22:12,420 --> 02:22:13,738
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. They're all the way out.

2044
02:22:13,738 --> 02:22:19,856
LAURA: Whose back is to me as I'm coming around
the corner? I'm assuming they don't see me because I'm--

2045
02:22:19,856 --> 02:22:21,599
TALIESIN: They don't, and it would be--

2046
02:22:21,599 --> 02:22:23,113
LAURA: Ivan?

2047
02:22:23,113 --> 02:22:36,032
TALIESIN: Damion's back is to you, although Sam
has just pulled a card. They're showing the card.

2048
02:22:36,032 --> 02:22:47,855
And they're showing the card to Ivan. You can't
quite make out what Ivan's saying, but Sam's not

2049
02:22:47,855 --> 02:22:55,787
having a good time about it and is arguing with
the rules for some strange reason. And out of

2050
02:22:55,787 --> 02:23:03,753
nowhere, a large spider comes out and pulls very
quickly Sam entirely away from the table.

2051
02:23:03,753 --> 02:23:05,179
TRAVIS: What? From where?

2052
02:23:05,179 --> 02:23:06,431
LAURA: Into the back corner?

2053
02:23:06,431 --> 02:23:16,177
TALIESIN: Whatever is back there. And then a
chair floats into view and rolls up to where Sam

2054
02:23:16,177 --> 02:23:20,788
was. You just heard screams and a spider clack of
(muffled sounds).

2055
02:23:20,788 --> 02:23:24,040
SAM: That's quite a card game.

2056
02:23:24,040 --> 02:23:29,180
TALIESIN: Ivan turns. "Amy, you're up."

2057
02:23:29,180 --> 02:23:33,056
LAURA: And Ivan seems completely unfazed by it?
But everybody else is creeped out?

2058
02:23:33,056 --> 02:23:37,434
TALIESIN: Yeah, Ivan's running a game, and it's
Amy's turn.

2059
02:23:37,434 --> 02:23:41,903
LAURA: Can I sneak around the room so I'm behind
Ivan?

2060
02:23:41,903 --> 02:23:45,679
TALIESIN: That might be difficult, but you can
give it a try.

2061
02:23:45,679 --> 02:23:49,414
LAURA: Am I going to die?

2062
02:23:49,414 --> 02:23:58,917
TALIESIN: There's no roll for that second
Obfuscate. You just burn and you do it, right?

2063
02:23:58,917 --> 02:24:01,526
LAURA: I just do it. Oh wait. No, wits and
stealth.

2064
02:24:01,526 --> 02:24:02,868
TALIESIN: Roll a wits stealth.

2065
02:24:02,868 --> 02:24:04,174
LAURA: Oh, I should have done that earlier!

2066
02:24:04,174 --> 02:24:06,471
TALIESIN: It's okay. This will work just fine.

2067
02:24:06,471 --> 02:24:08,413
LAURA: Do I have to use my two news?

2068
02:24:08,413 --> 02:24:09,363
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

2069
02:24:09,363 --> 02:24:10,216
LAURA: I do?

2070
02:24:10,216 --> 02:24:11,280
TALIESIN: Yeah, you do.

2071
02:24:11,280 --> 02:24:12,819
LAURA: I have to roll three reds on this?

2072
02:24:12,819 --> 02:24:13,675
TRAVIS: Yep.

2073
02:24:13,675 --> 02:24:16,944
Should've taken your head out of your ass, let's
go!

2074
02:24:16,944 --> 02:24:23,951
LAURA: Shut your fucking face! Stealth and wits.
Okay, hold on. (counting)

2075
02:24:23,951 --> 02:24:25,379
LIAM: Let's go, vampire.

2076
02:24:25,379 --> 02:24:29,449
LAURA: Okay, I got to choose my right dice here.
Okay, here we go. Oh my god.

2077
02:24:29,449 --> 02:24:31,988
LIAM and LAURA: Come on!

2078
02:24:31,988 --> 02:24:35,465
LIAM: Oh shit! Two failures.

2079
02:24:35,465 --> 02:24:37,320
TRAVIS and LIAM: On the reds.

2080
02:24:37,320 --> 02:24:38,978
LAURA: But I got a success!

2081
02:24:38,978 --> 02:24:44,234
TALIESIN: Two failures on the red? All right, this
is fun. How hungry are you?

2082
02:24:44,234 --> 02:24:49,314
LAURA: It was already three and just because I did
Obfuscate. It seems a little fucked up that I have

2083
02:24:49,314 --> 02:24:54,084
to use my new hungers on my power! You didn't have
to do that! <i>You</i> didn't have to do that!

2084
02:24:54,084 --> 02:24:57,021
TRAVIS: Quit blaming other people for your
weakness.

2085
02:24:57,021 --> 02:24:58,539
LAURA: I'm just saying, it's bullshit.

2086
02:24:58,539 --> 02:25:00,858
LIAM: You're rules-lawyering a game you barely
understand!

2087
02:25:00,858 --> 02:25:01,982
LAURA: Yeah, well--

2088
02:25:01,982 --> 02:25:07,937
TALIESIN: Here's the deal: you're going to get
seen. But we'll deal with that, because I want you

2089
02:25:07,937 --> 02:25:12,406
to make a note: you are hangry.

2090
02:25:12,406 --> 02:25:15,032
LAURA: I'm really fucking hungry.

2091
02:25:15,032 --> 02:25:20,923
TALIESIN: As in life. No, I have options here, and
I'm going hangry. You are down three on any

2092
02:25:20,923 --> 02:25:26,417
persuasion or subterfuge rolls because you are not
going to be subtle or cunning about anything.

2093
02:25:26,417 --> 02:25:32,488
Until you feed, you're going to be really on
edge.

2094
02:25:32,488 --> 02:25:34,950
LIAM: Time for a Taco Hell run.

2095
02:25:34,950 --> 02:25:47,533
TALIESIN: Amy Vorpahl frighteningly pulls a card,
puts it down, closes her eyes. Ivan pulls the

2096
02:25:47,533 --> 02:25:49,988
card, looks at it, smiles.

2097
02:25:49,988 --> 02:25:52,503
LAURA: Do they see me yet?

2098
02:25:52,503 --> 02:26:03,096
TALIESIN: Not yet. And then Ivan turns to Amy, and
Amy... it's like every piece of her rotates 45

2099
02:26:03,096 --> 02:26:12,261
degrees against itself. Not like meat, but like
glass, and then she shatters like a mirror. And

2100
02:26:12,261 --> 02:26:14,277
then a new chair pops right up.

2101
02:26:14,277 --> 02:26:16,012
TRAVIS: Cleanly? Does blood explode?

2102
02:26:16,012 --> 02:26:17,304
TALIESIN: No, it's just glass.

2103
02:26:17,304 --> 02:26:21,303
TRAVIS: Fragments? Amy fragments?

2104
02:26:21,303 --> 02:26:25,276
LAURA: Did it seem like Amy was a vampire before
she shattered?

2105
02:26:25,276 --> 02:26:27,996
TALIESIN: No, she smelled pretty good.

2106
02:26:27,996 --> 02:26:30,122
LAURA: Can I--

2107
02:26:30,122 --> 02:26:35,057
TALIESIN: Ivan turns to you, but Damion has not
seen you.

2108
02:26:35,057 --> 02:26:38,775
LAURA: I'm going to walk up behind Damion 
and bite the shit out of his neck.

2109
02:26:38,775 --> 02:26:44,188
TALIESIN: Okay, you have surprise on him, but not
Ivan. Ivan's going to allow it.

2110
02:26:44,188 --> 02:26:46,130
LAURA: Okay, I figured.

2111
02:26:46,130 --> 02:26:55,667
TALIESIN: Roll-- actually, since this is surprise.
Roll wits. This is going to be weird. Roll wits

2112
02:26:55,667 --> 02:27:00,495
and stealth. I'm going to make this a weird one.

2113
02:27:00,495 --> 02:27:03,731
LAURA: That's what I just rolled, and it was not
good.

2114
02:27:03,731 --> 02:27:10,064
TALIESIN: Yeah, try it again. How much are you
going to eat him? Are you going to eat him a

2115
02:27:10,064 --> 02:27:12,083
little, some, or a lot?

2116
02:27:12,083 --> 02:27:14,901
LAURA: (whispering) I want to suck his blood.

2117
02:27:14,901 --> 02:27:15,964
TALIESIN: Okay.

2118
02:27:15,964 --> 02:27:19,446
LAURA: A good amount of it. Not all of it.

2119
02:27:19,446 --> 02:27:20,519
TALIESIN: Not all of it?

2120
02:27:20,519 --> 02:27:29,737
LAURA: I'm going to leave him twitching. Success.
One success.

2121
02:27:29,737 --> 02:27:30,970
TALIESIN: One success?

2122
02:27:30,970 --> 02:27:32,062
LAURA: Yeah.

2123
02:27:32,062 --> 02:27:43,973
TALIESIN: That didn't count, because that hit
paper. Ignore me. Boy, he did not see you coming.

2124
02:27:43,973 --> 02:27:44,925
LAURA: He didn't?

2125
02:27:44,925 --> 02:27:45,821
TALIESIN: Nope.

2126
02:27:45,821 --> 02:27:47,073
LAURA: So I get to suck his blood.

2127
02:27:47,073 --> 02:27:51,393
TALIESIN: Yeah, but only one point worth, because
that was not a lot of success.

2128
02:27:51,393 --> 02:27:52,862
LAURA: At least that's something.

2129
02:27:52,862 --> 02:27:56,521
TALIESIN: He's very conscious and aware that
something is on his neck right now, and he's

2130
02:27:56,521 --> 02:27:59,229
freaking out. He's going to take a swipe at you.

2131
02:27:59,229 --> 02:28:01,153
LAURA: Maybe I'm part of Ivan's game.

2132
02:28:01,153 --> 02:28:02,584
LIAM: He's real big.

2133
02:28:02,584 --> 02:28:03,866
TALIESIN: Yeah, he's a big guy.

2134
02:28:03,866 --> 02:28:05,245
LAURA: He had a lot of blood.

2135
02:28:05,245 --> 02:28:08,911
TALIESIN: He's currently wearing my jacket, too,
so if you get any blood on my jacket, I'm going to

2136
02:28:08,911 --> 02:28:10,066
be very upset.

2137
02:28:10,066 --> 02:28:13,260
SAM: Is he wearing your jacket because you're
dead?

2138
02:28:13,260 --> 02:28:18,123
TALIESIN: No, he's wearing my jacket because I
lent it to him at the end of Wednesday Club last

2139
02:28:18,123 --> 02:28:20,587
week, and I haven't gotten it back yet.

2140
02:28:20,587 --> 02:28:24,842
LAURA: You smell like Taliesin. Where's Taliesin?

2141
02:28:24,842 --> 02:28:34,619
TALIESIN: That got weird. Thank you. So I'm
figuring out how to do this. He's going to try and

2142
02:28:34,619 --> 02:28:46,389
kick you off. Roll dex dodge, because he's going
to try and take a swipe at you. Dex dodge, and if

2143
02:28:46,389 --> 02:28:50,930
you want, you can burn willpower to roll the ones
you don't like over again.

2144
02:28:50,930 --> 02:28:54,435
LIAM: That's five. You get four, right?

2145
02:28:54,435 --> 02:28:56,234
LAURA: I get five.

2146
02:28:56,234 --> 02:28:57,419
LIAM: Three, plus?

2147
02:28:57,419 --> 02:29:00,125
LAURA: Dodge. It's four.

2148
02:29:00,125 --> 02:29:02,980
TALIESIN: Anything over a six?

2149
02:29:02,980 --> 02:29:04,708
LAURA: One success.

2150
02:29:04,708 --> 02:29:07,917
SAM and TALIESIN: Burn a will.

2151
02:29:07,917 --> 02:29:11,010
LAURA: I don't even know what that means!

2152
02:29:11,010 --> 02:29:14,642
TALIESIN: Do you see those little will dots? You
burn one, and you can reroll any of the

2153
02:29:14,642 --> 02:29:16,697
dice you like.

2154
02:29:16,697 --> 02:29:17,924
TRAVIS: Are you marking it off?

2155
02:29:17,924 --> 02:29:20,785
LAURA: And for each willpower, I reroll a dice?

2156
02:29:20,785 --> 02:29:24,183
TALIESIN: You can reroll as many dice as you like
on one roll, for one willpower.

2157
02:29:24,183 --> 02:29:31,261
LAURA: Okay, I'll try it, because you're saying to
do it. Two more successes.

2158
02:29:31,261 --> 02:29:38,301
TALIESIN: That's all you needed. There's a rule
that I forgot, but that's okay. I'll do it next

2159
02:29:38,301 --> 02:29:42,771
time. I'll remember that. Succeed at a cost. I
keep forgetting about succeed at a cost. It's

2160
02:29:42,771 --> 02:29:48,259
really cool. Yeah, you slap him down, and you're
right back in his neck, if you want to do a

2161
02:29:48,259 --> 02:29:56,896
strength plus two for your vampire fangs.

2162
02:29:56,896 --> 02:29:58,541
LAURA: Strength plus two?

2163
02:29:58,541 --> 02:29:59,894
TALIESIN: Yeah, strength plus two dice.

2164
02:29:59,894 --> 02:30:01,165
LIAM: Get that Big Gulp.

2165
02:30:01,165 --> 02:30:09,875
LAURA: (chomping sounds) Ooh. Well, no. No
failures, but one success.

2166
02:30:09,875 --> 02:30:11,848
TALIESIN: One success? You get one more out of
him.

2167
02:30:11,848 --> 02:30:14,660
LIAM: Why did you hit the mouse again?

2168
02:30:14,660 --> 02:30:16,374
TALIESIN: Why do you keep hitting my mouse, man?

2169
02:30:16,374 --> 02:30:19,203
LAURA: Well, he's sitting right there.

2170
02:30:19,203 --> 02:30:21,238
TALIESIN: Do you want to keep draining or do you
want to back off?

2171
02:30:21,238 --> 02:30:22,997
LAURA: No, I'm good. I'm going to let him live.

2172
02:30:22,997 --> 02:30:25,042
TALIESIN: Are you going to back off or you just
let go?

2173
02:30:25,042 --> 02:30:30,380
LAURA: I'm going to push him forward against the
table and back off really quickly.

2174
02:30:30,380 --> 02:30:34,254
TALIESIN: Are you going to push him forward
against the table?

2175
02:30:34,254 --> 02:30:36,832
LAURA: Yeah. So he doesn't lunge at me as I back
up.

2176
02:30:36,832 --> 02:30:45,889
TALIESIN: (snorts) Yeah, fuck it. That's funny.
I'm going to let that happen. He slips as you push

2177
02:30:45,889 --> 02:30:51,806
him towards the table and he leaves his seat and
falls off into the darkness. He falls like he fell

2178
02:30:51,806 --> 02:30:53,954
off a building <i>down</i>.

2179
02:30:53,954 --> 02:30:56,290
LAURA: Like he can't walk in the darkness like I'm
walking?

2180
02:30:56,290 --> 02:31:01,364
TALIESIN: He was on the table and you pushed off
and pushed him off his seat and there's no floor

2181
02:31:01,364 --> 02:31:03,458
apparently because he just dropped.

2182
02:31:03,458 --> 02:31:06,100
LAURA: Whoops.

2183
02:31:06,100 --> 02:31:10,096
TALIESIN: You seem to be standing on it fine, but
it didn't work for him.

2184
02:31:10,096 --> 02:31:12,060
LAURA: What? Ivan, hi.

2185
02:31:12,060 --> 02:31:19,043
TALIESIN: "Hey, Laura. It's so good to see you.
This is great."

2186
02:31:19,043 --> 02:31:21,453
LAURA: You too, man. This looked like a pretty
crazy game you're playing.

2187
02:31:21,453 --> 02:31:24,290
TALIESIN: "I've been really excited. I've been
wanting to get you in one of my games for a while.

2188
02:31:24,290 --> 02:31:28,115
"This is the best one I've put together in quite a
while."

2189
02:31:28,115 --> 02:31:29,984
LAURA: Yeah, I remember Paranoia with you.

2190
02:31:29,984 --> 02:31:36,100
TALIESIN: "That was fun. My whole game has gone
to another level. I've had a really-- this has

2191
02:31:36,100 --> 02:31:38,257
"been a good year. You want to play?"

2192
02:31:38,257 --> 02:31:40,149
LAURA: No, you know what? I think I'm good.

2193
02:31:40,149 --> 02:31:43,566
TALIESIN: "I think it could be worth your while."

2194
02:31:43,566 --> 02:31:54,602
LAURA: Do you know what the deal is with that
circle out by the Twitch door is?

2195
02:31:54,602 --> 02:32:02,476
TALIESIN: "I do. I know a lot about what's going on.
I have talked to so many people."

2196
02:32:02,476 --> 02:32:03,937
LAURA: You have?

2197
02:32:03,937 --> 02:32:07,410
TALIESIN: "Oh, yes I have. It's been
fascinating."

2198
02:32:07,410 --> 02:32:12,861
LAURA: How long has <i>it</i> been?

2199
02:32:12,861 --> 02:32:17,585
TALIESIN: (sighs) "I feel you haven't earned that
kind of information yet. Honestly, I feel that

2200
02:32:17,585 --> 02:32:23,859
"this whole sneaking-up-on-my-game and trying to
like-- honestly, costing Damion his turn. That's

2201
02:32:23,859 --> 02:32:24,842
"just tacky."

2202
02:32:24,842 --> 02:32:26,942
LAURA: I just thought we're on the same side
here.

2203
02:32:26,942 --> 02:32:32,603
TALIESIN: "There's no sides. We're all friends and
it's just a game. You want to play the game?"

2204
02:32:32,603 --> 02:32:35,372
LAURA: No!

2205
02:32:35,372 --> 02:32:44,131
TALIESIN: "I'll make it worth your while. You win
a little bit and maybe there'll be some answers in

2206
02:32:44,131 --> 02:32:45,498
"here for you."

2207
02:32:45,498 --> 02:32:47,468
LAURA: It didn't seem like it was possible to
win?

2208
02:32:47,468 --> 02:33:00,683
TALIESIN: "Well, here's what I'll say. I have so
many cards that could be pulled and the cards they

2209
02:33:00,683 --> 02:33:02,365
"pulled are already gone--"

2210
02:33:02,365 --> 02:33:04,974
LAURA: Travis learned this lesson before.

2211
02:33:04,974 --> 02:33:08,490
TALIESIN: "See, if you think about it though,
Travis is really the reason this is happening

2212
02:33:08,490 --> 02:33:13,658
"right now. The whole theory for this game is
because of Travis. You should pull a card. He

2213
02:33:13,658 --> 02:33:16,092
"really likes it when you pull cards."

2214
02:33:16,092 --> 02:33:17,610
TRAVIS: I really do.

2215
02:33:17,610 --> 02:33:22,987
TALIESIN: "Pulling cards makes the Father happy."

2216
02:33:22,987 --> 02:33:25,737
LAURA: I kind of want to pull a card.

2217
02:33:25,737 --> 02:33:27,092
SAM: Sure. Of course you do.

2218
02:33:27,092 --> 02:33:28,231
TALIESIN: "Sit down."

2219
02:33:28,231 --> 02:33:31,214
TRAVIS: Yeah! (laughs) Yes!

2220
02:33:31,214 --> 02:33:32,530
SAM: Oh boy.

2221
02:33:32,530 --> 02:33:35,707
LAURA: I will sit down if you answer a question as
I sit down and then I'll pull a card.

2222
02:33:35,707 --> 02:33:39,162
TALIESIN: "It entirely depends on the question."

2223
02:33:39,162 --> 02:33:43,505
LAURA: Okay. I sit down.

2224
02:33:43,505 --> 02:33:47,015
TALIESIN: You feel heavy as you sit down.

2225
02:33:47,015 --> 02:33:51,920
LAURA: This is a stupid idea. Marisha sat down and
had some tea. She died.

2226
02:33:51,920 --> 02:33:57,924
TALIESIN: "Marisha drank the tea? Oh, he's not
going to be happy. Why would she-- that's not smart."

2227
02:33:57,924 --> 02:34:00,817
LAURA: I don't know. I wasn't there. I just know
that she drank tea and then she turned into a

2228
02:34:00,817 --> 02:34:01,707
mushroom.

2229
02:34:01,707 --> 02:34:03,035
TALIESIN: "Yeah, that'll happen."

2230
02:34:03,035 --> 02:34:14,054
LAURA: How come we were put in coffins and turned
into vampires and some people are delicious?

2231
02:34:14,054 --> 02:34:20,174
TALIESIN: "Oh, that's really complicated. That's a
very complicated question. There's a lot happening

2232
02:34:20,174 --> 02:34:28,896
"and I'm going to be honest with you. Not all of
this was the plan. I specifically get the feeling

2233
02:34:28,896 --> 02:34:33,138
"that a lot of this has gone a little off-track."

2234
02:34:33,138 --> 02:34:35,256
LAURA: Yeah. It seems like it.

2235
02:34:35,256 --> 02:34:39,479
TALIESIN: "It does, doesn't it? I'm doing what I
can, but really, what can we do other than trying

2236
02:34:39,479 --> 02:34:41,657
"to make some good content, you know?"

2237
02:34:41,657 --> 02:34:47,166
LAURA: Right. Yeah. Just waiting for the door to
open to the Twitch stage.

2238
02:34:47,166 --> 02:34:50,554
TALIESIN: "That's a cute, clever puzzle. How are
you doing on that?"

2239
02:34:50,554 --> 02:34:55,307
LAURA: Well, we're doing pretty good. Pretty good.
Looking for clues.

2240
02:34:55,307 --> 02:34:57,310
TALIESIN: "What have you solved so far?"

2241
02:34:57,310 --> 02:35:10,052
LAURA: I will answer that if you make sure I pull
a good card. Beneficial card for me, not for you.

2242
02:35:10,052 --> 02:35:16,116
TRAVIS: Oh shit!

2243
02:35:16,116 --> 02:35:21,536
TALIESIN: Electricity crackles from the back of
his spine and seems to make an arcing pattern

2244
02:35:21,536 --> 02:35:28,257
through the darkness that's almost a circuit
breaker. "Oh, heart and sun. Not bad."

2245
02:35:28,257 --> 02:35:30,367
LAURA: Oh shit.

2246
02:35:30,367 --> 02:35:31,771
SAM: He knows things.

2247
02:35:31,771 --> 02:35:39,463
TALIESIN: "I'm running a game here. I got to be on
top of it. If you're not on top of it, that's how you lose!"

2248
02:35:39,463 --> 02:35:43,240
LAURA: I turned into a vampire, you're some weird
electric thing! That's fun.

2249
02:35:43,240 --> 02:35:46,918
(laughter)

2250
02:35:46,982 --> 02:35:50,823
TALIESIN: (sighs) "It's just crazy, the sorts of
people you work with here, isn't it?"

2251
02:35:50,823 --> 02:35:52,124
LAURA: I know.

2252
02:35:52,124 --> 02:35:59,085
TALIESIN: "Yeah. He'll be very happy if you take a
card. You can yell for people, by the way. There's no

2253
02:35:59,085 --> 02:36:00,589
"problem. This is a game for everybody."

2254
02:36:00,589 --> 02:36:02,109
LAURA: Yeah, I did yell for him.

2255
02:36:02,109 --> 02:36:03,949
TRAVIS: How loud?

2256
02:36:03,949 --> 02:36:06,519
LAURA: Travis? About that loud.

2257
02:36:06,519 --> 02:36:07,868
TRAVIS: That's-- I mean, you're way back there.

2258
02:36:07,868 --> 02:36:09,790
LAURA: I know. But I don't know how quiet it is in
the building.

2259
02:36:09,790 --> 02:36:11,101
TALIESIN: And you do have--

2260
02:36:11,101 --> 02:36:13,269
TRAVIS: I do have Heightened Senses! Can I hear
her?

2261
02:36:13,269 --> 02:36:14,769
TALIESIN: How loud?

2262
02:36:14,769 --> 02:36:16,175
LAURA: Travis?

2263
02:36:16,175 --> 02:36:18,282
TALIESIN: No. (laughs)

2264
02:36:18,282 --> 02:36:22,758
TRAVIS: I mean, if you want to be a big girl about
it. (laughs)

2265
02:36:22,758 --> 02:36:26,213
LIAM: Can we lower the gain on the mic, though?

2266
02:36:26,213 --> 02:36:31,624
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, that's fair. "I
mean, we can call everybody over if you like."

2267
02:36:31,624 --> 02:36:36,982
LAURA: I just feel like he's really going to want
to pull a card and I don't know if he should. I

2268
02:36:36,982 --> 02:36:41,379
feel like maybe, if this is a bad thing, then
we'll-- this will be just me and then they will

2269
02:36:41,379 --> 02:36:42,747
never know.

2270
02:36:42,747 --> 02:36:44,721
TALIESIN: "All right."

2271
02:36:44,721 --> 02:36:46,712
TRAVIS: This has been going on for a while.

2272
02:36:46,712 --> 02:36:47,996
LAURA: Yeah.

2273
02:36:47,996 --> 02:36:49,776
TALIESIN: Pick a card.

2274
02:36:49,776 --> 02:36:51,269
LAURA: (yells)

2275
02:36:51,269 --> 02:36:52,700
TALIESIN: Make a pull.

2276
02:36:52,700 --> 02:36:56,396
LAURA: Is this one of those magician tricks where
you're telling me to pull a certain one and I

2277
02:36:56,396 --> 02:36:57,442
don't realise it?

2278
02:36:57,442 --> 02:36:58,450
TALIESIN: Yes.

2279
02:36:58,450 --> 02:37:00,827
TRAVIS: I'll say I pulled from the middle before
and it was the Void.

2280
02:37:00,827 --> 02:37:06,509
TALIESIN: There is no Void card in this set
because this is not a Deck of Many Things. You

2281
02:37:06,509 --> 02:37:11,459
pulled the Two of Swords. Oh dear.

2282
02:37:11,459 --> 02:37:12,827
SAM: Which is?

2283
02:37:12,827 --> 02:37:22,626
TALIESIN: Two of Swords is two bleeds. Suddenly,
blood gets sucked straight out of your fingertips

2284
02:37:22,626 --> 02:37:28,934
through the card into the base.

2285
02:37:28,934 --> 02:37:30,624
LAURA: Oh no, I just got rid of these things!

2286
02:37:30,624 --> 02:37:31,702
TALIESIN: Two more.

2287
02:37:31,702 --> 02:37:33,615
LAURA: Shit! Ugh.

2288
02:37:33,615 --> 02:37:35,445
TALIESIN: "That was a rough pull."

2289
02:37:35,445 --> 02:37:37,062
LAURA: Yeah, dude. It was.

2290
02:37:37,062 --> 02:37:45,654
TALIESIN: "But everything has a price and so for
that, swords. Swords are about knowledge. So what

2291
02:37:45,654 --> 02:37:47,095
"do you want to know?"

2292
02:37:47,095 --> 02:37:48,789
TRAVIS: Ooh.

2293
02:37:48,789 --> 02:37:51,491
TALIESIN: "If I can answer it, I will. I'll find
something I can answer."

2294
02:37:51,491 --> 02:37:55,167
SAM: (whispering) The puzzle!

2295
02:37:55,167 --> 02:38:02,380
LAURA: How do I solve the-- hmm.

2296
02:38:02,380 --> 02:38:04,388
TALIESIN: "That's too broad."

2297
02:38:04,388 --> 02:38:12,664
LAURA: What coincides with the picture of the head
on the puzzle?

2298
02:38:12,664 --> 02:38:16,864
TALIESIN: Well, let me find out on my sheet.

2299
02:38:16,864 --> 02:38:19,292
(laughter)

2300
02:38:19,292 --> 02:38:22,276
TALIESIN: I made too many notes.

2301
02:38:22,276 --> 02:38:27,035
LAURA: Am I still bleeding from my fingertips
creepily? All things considered though, this isn't

2302
02:38:27,035 --> 02:38:30,241
as bad as the spider or the shattering body.

2303
02:38:30,241 --> 02:38:33,336
LIAM: Or a horse.

2304
02:38:33,336 --> 02:38:39,858
TALIESIN: No, you did okay. So there are--

2305
02:38:39,858 --> 02:38:43,098
LAURA: I'm holding my hands up so I stop
bleeding.

2306
02:38:43,098 --> 02:38:49,606
TALIESIN: Swords are about-- it's taken it.
They've closed up. The card itself gave you paper

2307
02:38:49,606 --> 02:38:51,383
cuts and sucked everything out and then they--

2308
02:38:51,383 --> 02:38:52,540
LAURA: I hate paper cuts.

2309
02:38:52,540 --> 02:38:53,948
TALIESIN: Right on the fingertips, too.

2310
02:38:53,948 --> 02:38:55,242
TRAVIS: Like a surgeon.

2311
02:38:55,242 --> 02:38:56,470
LAURA: Yeah.

2312
02:38:56,470 --> 02:39:02,883
TALIESIN: "Heads are knowledge. They're the base of
consciousness. You need to make an offering of

2313
02:39:02,883 --> 02:39:08,318
"understanding. You need to find a symbol of
understanding what's happening and what you are.

2314
02:39:08,318 --> 02:39:13,882
"You need to find something that expresses that
understanding."

2315
02:39:13,882 --> 02:39:16,805
LAURA: That we know that we're vampires,
basically?

2316
02:39:16,805 --> 02:39:23,621
TALIESIN: "Yes, and you have to prove it now. So
you have to find something that proves that you

2317
02:39:23,621 --> 02:39:31,248
"know that you're vampires, something of
intellectual proof of it. Now, I might know where

2318
02:39:31,248 --> 02:39:34,620
"something is, but that's another question."

2319
02:39:34,620 --> 02:39:38,187
LAURA: I think I'm okay.

2320
02:39:38,187 --> 02:39:49,734
TRAVIS: I've made my way back to the back at this
point. Hey. Hey, Ivan.

2321
02:39:49,734 --> 02:39:51,789
LAURA: Ivan. He's made of electricity now.

2322
02:39:51,789 --> 02:39:54,688
TRAVIS: That's fun.

2323
02:39:54,688 --> 02:39:56,255
TALIESIN: "Things have gotten weird."

2324
02:39:56,255 --> 02:39:57,522
TRAVIS: I gather.

2325
02:39:57,522 --> 02:39:59,822
LAURA: Baby, I pulled a card.

2326
02:39:59,822 --> 02:40:00,974
TRAVIS: You did?

2327
02:40:00,974 --> 02:40:02,109
LAURA: Yeah.

2328
02:40:02,109 --> 02:40:05,710
TALIESIN: "It made Father very happy. I think you
should pull a card, too."

2329
02:40:05,710 --> 02:40:07,013
TRAVIS: Yeah!

2330
02:40:07,013 --> 02:40:11,245
LAURA: Okay, but you didn't see what happened with
the other cards. There was a giant--

2331
02:40:11,245 --> 02:40:13,304
TRAVIS: How bad could it be?

2332
02:40:13,304 --> 02:40:19,465
LAURA: Amy rotated like she was made of glass and
then shattered. Like gone.

2333
02:40:19,465 --> 02:40:21,905
TALIESIN: "That card's only one pull, so that's
fine."

2334
02:40:21,905 --> 02:40:25,735
LAURA: And Sam got eaten by a giant spider.

2335
02:40:25,735 --> 02:40:27,513
TALIESIN: "The other Sam."

2336
02:40:27,513 --> 02:40:32,522
TRAVIS: You know what, Ivan, I'm a fan of card
games. I am.

2337
02:40:32,522 --> 02:40:33,987
TALIESIN: Have you sat down, by the way?

2338
02:40:33,987 --> 02:40:41,737
TRAVIS: I haven't. I'm a fan of card games. I hate
to rush into anything too hastily.

2339
02:40:41,737 --> 02:40:43,748
LAURA: I'm so hungry.

2340
02:40:43,748 --> 02:40:50,648
TRAVIS: Yeah, you don't look so great. Maybe we'll
check out the rest of this floor real fast and

2341
02:40:50,648 --> 02:40:53,403
then I'll come back.

2342
02:40:53,403 --> 02:40:55,497
TALIESIN: "Hopefully I'll be here when you get
back, but fine."

2343
02:40:55,497 --> 02:40:56,852
LAURA: Can I get up?

2344
02:40:56,852 --> 02:40:59,572
TALIESIN: "No, I need a player."

2345
02:40:59,572 --> 02:41:02,920
TRAVIS: Do you need us to send in Chris or
Arcade?

2346
02:41:02,920 --> 02:41:04,722
TALIESIN: "I don't care who you send in. I just
need a player."

2347
02:41:04,722 --> 02:41:07,689
TRAVIS: Fair enough. Sam?

2348
02:41:07,689 --> 02:41:09,786
LIAM: We're in the bathroom, right?

2349
02:41:09,786 --> 02:41:11,297
SAM: Me Sam?

2350
02:41:11,297 --> 02:41:12,295
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2351
02:41:12,295 --> 02:41:14,160
SAM: Yeah, I think we're in the bathroom, right?

2352
02:41:14,160 --> 02:41:16,312
LAURA: You just hid in the bathroom the whole
time?

2353
02:41:16,312 --> 02:41:17,352
SAM: No, I don't know--

2354
02:41:17,352 --> 02:41:19,780
LIAM: No, we left off of us ages-- a while back.

2355
02:41:19,780 --> 02:41:23,474
TALIESIN: The bathrooms are sadly the bathrooms,
except more so.

2356
02:41:23,474 --> 02:41:24,874
LIAM: There's nothing going on in the bathrooms.

2357
02:41:24,874 --> 02:41:26,583
SAM: We didn't find anything in the walls?

2358
02:41:26,583 --> 02:41:28,372
TALIESIN: You found some toilet paper.

2359
02:41:28,372 --> 02:41:29,780
SAM: Anything to eat?

2360
02:41:29,780 --> 02:41:36,006
TALIESIN: You found some toilet paper. You found
the weird little ghost that hides in the-- have

2361
02:41:36,006 --> 02:41:40,412
you ever seen the ghost on the pipe? You can pull
that lever and see what happens.

2362
02:41:40,412 --> 02:41:44,636
LIAM: We could keep going back around. There's
conference rooms back there now, where they keep

2363
02:41:44,636 --> 02:41:46,473
all the games where you shot The Slayer's Cake.

2364
02:41:46,473 --> 02:41:48,050
SAM: Yeah, let's go search.

2365
02:41:48,050 --> 02:41:49,957
LIAM: Those dragon torches are there, too.

2366
02:41:49,957 --> 02:41:52,826
TALIESIN: You guys are going to go check out the
library wall?

2367
02:41:52,826 --> 02:42:01,883
SAM: As we go, I'm going to tell Liam: Listen, I
convinced Laura that I'm on her side.

2368
02:42:01,883 --> 02:42:04,998
LIAM: Did she believe you?

2369
02:42:04,998 --> 02:42:05,985
SAM: Totally.

2370
02:42:05,985 --> 02:42:07,325
LIAM: Are you sure?

2371
02:42:07,325 --> 02:42:14,345
SAM: Yes. When she goes down, she's going to try
to kick you or throw you down or trip you up, but

2372
02:42:14,345 --> 02:42:19,275
I'm going to walk behind her, club her in the back
of the head, and we're going to make off like

2373
02:42:19,275 --> 02:42:20,577
bandits.

2374
02:42:20,577 --> 02:42:22,552
LIAM: I know.

2375
02:42:22,552 --> 02:42:27,029
TALIESIN: So, are you guys going as far as the
bookcase? Are you guys going deeper in?

2376
02:42:27,029 --> 02:42:32,481
SAM: The bookcase is literally the end of my
knowledge of the way out of the building.

2377
02:42:32,481 --> 02:42:37,006
LIAM: I will lead Sam-- unless we see something of
note.

2378
02:42:37,006 --> 02:42:38,929
TALIESIN: You want to take a look at the
bookcase?

2379
02:42:38,929 --> 02:42:40,229
LIAM: Sure. Do I see anything--

2380
02:42:40,229 --> 02:42:41,768
SAM: Is there more building past the bookcase?

2381
02:42:41,768 --> 02:42:45,518
LIAM: There is a little bit more. There's a couple
of conference rooms. Glass doors, windows.

2382
02:42:45,518 --> 02:42:48,686
TALIESIN: There was a map that you guys could
find, but you're never going to find it, which

2383
02:42:48,686 --> 02:42:50,756
makes me laugh really hard. But yes, there's a--

2384
02:42:50,756 --> 02:42:54,507
LIAM: Yeah, we're walking past these shelves of
tabletop games.

2385
02:42:54,507 --> 02:42:58,224
TALIESIN: All right. You can do a perception
investigation.

2386
02:42:58,224 --> 02:42:59,696
LIAM: Yeah, sure.

2387
02:42:59,696 --> 02:43:02,377
SAM: Perception investigation.

2388
02:43:02,377 --> 02:43:05,385
TALIESIN: Or you can use occult, if that's a
better number for you as well.

2389
02:43:05,385 --> 02:43:06,818
SAM: I failed on a red.

2390
02:43:06,818 --> 02:43:08,303
TALIESIN: You got a one on a red?

2391
02:43:08,303 --> 02:43:09,217
SAM: Yes.

2392
02:43:09,217 --> 02:43:10,984
LIAM: I also failed on a red.

2393
02:43:10,984 --> 02:43:14,080
TALIESIN: You both failed on a red, but what was
your score total?

2394
02:43:14,080 --> 02:43:16,624
LIAM: Two successes, one fail on a red.

2395
02:43:16,624 --> 02:43:17,819
SAM: One success.

2396
02:43:17,819 --> 02:43:27,792
TALIESIN: You guys, you talk about looking at the
bookshelf, but you're just talking to each other,

2397
02:43:27,792 --> 02:43:35,901
and going back and forth talking about how foolish
Laura was to trust you. Yeah, you're just doing a

2398
02:43:35,969 --> 02:43:38,344
bit. You just keep doing a bit.

2399
02:43:38,344 --> 02:43:45,219
LIAM: If we get through this, we have to record
another episode of the podcast. And not one that

2400
02:43:45,219 --> 02:43:46,555
we do at the convention, Sam--

2401
02:43:46,555 --> 02:43:48,774
SAM: We recorded one at the convention and then I
never edited it.

2402
02:43:48,774 --> 02:43:50,326
LIAM: You never edited it, dumbass.

2403
02:43:50,326 --> 02:43:52,135
SAM: Man, we have it right now. It's already
done.

2404
02:43:52,135 --> 02:43:53,461
LIAM: Yeah, we got to release that one.

2405
02:43:53,461 --> 02:43:55,027
TALIESIN: Yuck, nope, nevermind. That didn't
happen.

2406
02:43:55,027 --> 02:43:57,649
LIAM: There's another one. Just you and me.

2407
02:43:57,649 --> 02:44:00,042
SAM: With some other people. Yeah, we'll do that.

2408
02:44:00,042 --> 02:44:01,154
TRAVIS: Laura.

2409
02:44:01,154 --> 02:44:02,098
LAURA: What?

2410
02:44:02,098 --> 02:44:04,788
TRAVIS: Why don't you stand up and come with me
and we'll come back.

2411
02:44:04,788 --> 02:44:06,497
LAURA: I can't.

2412
02:44:06,497 --> 02:44:09,035
TALIESIN: "She can't stand up until I say so and I
need a player."

2413
02:44:09,035 --> 02:44:10,844
TRAVIS: Is that right?

2414
02:44:10,844 --> 02:44:12,135
LAURA: I can try.

2415
02:44:12,135 --> 02:44:13,524
TALIESIN: "You can try and stand up."

2416
02:44:13,524 --> 02:44:15,339
LAURA: (straining)

2417
02:44:15,339 --> 02:44:20,163
TALIESIN: Okay, you now see what's in front of
you, once you're--

2418
02:44:20,163 --> 02:44:21,941
SAM: Oh, god, what's going on?

2419
02:44:21,941 --> 02:44:23,559
LAURA: I can't stand up. I'm so hungry.

2420
02:44:23,559 --> 02:44:24,876
LIAM: She's nowhere near us.

2421
02:44:24,876 --> 02:44:26,628
TRAVIS: Ivan's here and has electrical powers.

2422
02:44:26,628 --> 02:44:27,726
SAM: Oh, okay.

2423
02:44:27,726 --> 02:44:31,939
LIAM: Oh, the voided room is back here? Oh, I
didn't realize where it was.

2424
02:44:31,939 --> 02:44:36,610
TALIESIN: I feel like I'm the only one who's
explored this entire building. There are some

2425
02:44:36,610 --> 02:44:37,819
nooks and crannies, man.

2426
02:44:37,819 --> 02:44:42,394
LIAM: I know what's in the actual building. I
didn't know the void was back here.

2427
02:44:42,394 --> 02:44:45,111
TALIESIN: Spend enough time back there and it's a
real void. It's kind of intense.

2428
02:44:45,111 --> 02:44:48,673
TRAIS: Apparently Ivan's made of electricity now
and he has a card game for us to play, but he

2429
02:44:48,673 --> 02:44:49,994
needs players.

2430
02:44:49,994 --> 02:44:51,605
TALIESIN: "Come sit."

2431
02:44:51,605 --> 02:44:53,502
LAURA: Sam, you want to come play this card game?

2432
02:44:53,502 --> 02:44:55,002
LIAM: And do what?

2433
02:44:55,002 --> 02:44:56,733
SAM: Why can't-- looks like you're playing.

2434
02:44:56,733 --> 02:44:58,741
TRAVIS: How many chairs are there?

2435
02:44:58,741 --> 02:45:01,072
TALIESIN: Three. Two. Two empty chairs along with
her.

2436
02:45:01,072 --> 02:45:03,386
TRAVIS: Of the three of us, only two others can
play.

2437
02:45:03,386 --> 02:45:06,662
TALIESIN: "Or once I have somebody else sitting
down, somebody else can get up."

2438
02:45:06,662 --> 02:45:08,796
LIAM: What, to fill the chairs? What kind of game
is it?

2439
02:45:08,796 --> 02:45:13,329
TRAVIS: You draw a card. She drew a card and
learned something.

2440
02:45:13,329 --> 02:45:15,930
LAURA: I did. I learned something about the
thing.

2441
02:45:15,930 --> 02:45:17,771
SAM: It seems like Travis should play. He's a card
guy.

2442
02:45:17,771 --> 02:45:20,196
LIAM: Straight up, do you think this is safe for
me?

2443
02:45:20,196 --> 02:45:21,594
TRAVIS: I don't know.

2444
02:45:21,594 --> 02:45:24,662
TALIESIN: "Is anything safe? I mean, come on,
people."

2445
02:45:24,662 --> 02:45:27,104
LIAM: What do you feel? For me, I mean.

2446
02:45:27,104 --> 02:45:33,173
TRAVIS: Given my general feeling of our
environment, I think almost all this shit's fucked up.

2447
02:45:33,173 --> 02:45:34,426
LIAM: Okay.

2448
02:45:34,426 --> 02:45:37,613
TRAVIS: Just a fair bit of sprinkling of that,
just about everywhere I look.

2449
02:45:37,613 --> 02:45:39,624
SAM: Can we find someone else to play this game?

2450
02:45:39,624 --> 02:45:41,909
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think so.

2451
02:45:41,909 --> 02:45:45,064
SAM: Why don't we go find somebody else to play
this game? Are there any others?

2452
02:45:45,064 --> 02:45:47,972
TRAVIS: That's a good idea? Actually, Sam, why
don't you go snag--?

2453
02:45:47,972 --> 02:45:49,473
LIAM: Dani?

2454
02:45:49,473 --> 02:45:50,729
TRAVIS: Max?

2455
02:45:50,729 --> 02:45:52,766
LAURA: Did we see Max yet?

2456
02:45:52,766 --> 02:45:54,026
SAM: Where's Max?

2457
02:45:54,026 --> 02:45:58,566
TRAVIS: Max is back in the office. He's wearing a
Drink Me sign. Why don't you go snag Max?

2458
02:45:58,566 --> 02:46:01,510
SAM: All right, if I'm not back in 30 seconds...

2459
02:46:01,510 --> 02:46:03,155
LAURA: That's a long walk.

2460
02:46:03,155 --> 02:46:05,460
TALIESIN: Are you going to walk or are you going
to jog?

2461
02:46:05,460 --> 02:46:06,615
SAM: I'll run.

2462
02:46:06,615 --> 02:46:09,753
TALIESIN: All right, well done, you. You go really
fast.

2463
02:46:09,753 --> 02:46:11,347
TRAVIS: Oh, two of them?

2464
02:46:11,347 --> 02:46:12,497
LAURA: You have a power!

2465
02:46:12,497 --> 02:46:14,841
SAM: I have a power. What's my power?

2466
02:46:14,841 --> 02:46:16,417
TALIESIN: You go really fast.

2467
02:46:16,417 --> 02:46:17,962
LAURA: Whoa.

2468
02:46:17,962 --> 02:46:20,768
SAM: Celerity.

2469
02:46:20,768 --> 02:46:22,174
LIAM: Is he a speedster now?

2470
02:46:22,174 --> 02:46:25,719
SAM: Your body responds so quickly that the world
around you seems to slow down.

2471
02:46:25,719 --> 02:46:27,823
ALL: Whoa.

2472
02:46:27,823 --> 02:46:31,606
TALIESIN: I was really hoping you were going to
try and hit Arcade at some point and there was

2473
02:46:31,606 --> 02:46:34,327
just going to be a fwap! But no, you were so
nice.

2474
02:46:34,327 --> 02:46:43,122
SAM: Oh wow. I go all over the place. Okay. All
right, so I'm going to run back there.

2475
02:46:43,122 --> 02:46:47,885
TALIESIN: If we burn that blood, you are back in
seconds with Max. He doesn't even really quite

2476
02:46:47,885 --> 02:46:49,865
register what happened.

2477
02:46:49,865 --> 02:46:51,568
SAM: Burn that blood. What do I do? What's--

2478
02:46:51,568 --> 02:46:53,214
TALIESIN: You just have an extra blood die now.

2479
02:46:53,214 --> 02:46:55,574
LAURA: Max! Come sit down!

2480
02:46:55,574 --> 02:47:00,805
TALIESIN: He is at the point where he is just
going to do what he's told, so he sits down.

2481
02:47:00,805 --> 02:47:02,477
TRAVIS: Max, sit down at the table.

2482
02:47:02,477 --> 02:47:05,236
LAURA: Yeah. Can I get up?

2483
02:47:05,236 --> 02:47:06,423
TALIESIN: Yeah, you can get up.

2484
02:47:06,423 --> 02:47:07,648
LAURA: I get up.

2485
02:47:07,648 --> 02:47:10,779
TRAVIS: Now, before we leave, I would like to see
a card drawn.

2486
02:47:10,779 --> 02:47:13,571
LAURA: Oh, okay. Max can pull one, then.

2487
02:47:13,571 --> 02:47:16,672
TRAVIS: Yeah, Max, pull a card.

2488
02:47:16,672 --> 02:47:23,861
TALIESIN: This is my best Max face. I don't know
how well it's coming out.

2489
02:47:23,861 --> 02:47:26,611
(laughter)

2490
02:47:26,611 --> 02:47:39,389
TALIESIN: Max jolts and has a weird clarity to him
for the first time in-- it seems like his eyes

2491
02:47:39,389 --> 02:47:46,464
unpuffen and he just looks like a normal--
moisture comes back to his face and he looks

2492
02:47:46,464 --> 02:48:00,643
slightly healthier and he's got a moment of, "We've
got to get out of here before that thing upstairs

2493
02:48:00,643 --> 02:48:01,835
"comes down."

2494
02:48:01,835 --> 02:48:03,399
TRAVIS: What's upstairs, Max?

2495
02:48:03,399 --> 02:48:13,503
TALIESIN: "It's this creature. It's just teeth and
claws and I'm not going to say wolf, but there's

2496
02:48:13,503 --> 02:48:16,438
"something up there that's big and--"

2497
02:48:16,438 --> 02:48:18,058
TRAVIS: Beast-like?

2498
02:48:18,058 --> 02:48:23,042
TALIESIN: "It's been a lot. There's been a lot
that's happened."

2499
02:48:23,042 --> 02:48:28,016
TRAVIS: Max, the last thing we remember is leaving
after the last game. How long have you been here?

2500
02:48:28,016 --> 02:48:34,650
TALIESIN: "After the last game? That's the last
thing you--" (sighs)

2501
02:48:34,650 --> 02:48:40,068
LAURA: Max, what happened? How long has it been?

2502
02:48:40,068 --> 02:48:41,821
TALIESIN: "It's been a long week."

2503
02:48:41,821 --> 02:48:43,786
LAURA: It's been a whole week?

2504
02:48:43,786 --> 02:48:45,527
SAM: Is it Thursday again?

2505
02:48:45,527 --> 02:48:54,495
TALIESIN: "I haven't seen the sun in three days,
four days? I don't know what-- no one knows what's

2506
02:48:54,495 --> 02:48:58,424
"going on. Things have gotten very weird, but
you've got to get us out of here."

2507
02:48:58,424 --> 02:49:00,341
LAURA: Do people in the outside world know what's
happening?

2508
02:49:00,341 --> 02:49:03,547
TRAVIS: When I look at Ivan, does he look
disappointed or pleased with the outcome of this

2509
02:49:03,547 --> 02:49:04,568
card pull?

2510
02:49:04,568 --> 02:49:07,555
TALIESIN: He's waiting for another player.

2511
02:49:07,555 --> 02:49:10,956
TRAVIS: All right, Max, come with us.

2512
02:49:10,956 --> 02:49:12,600
TALIESIN: "I can't get up."

2513
02:49:12,600 --> 02:49:20,555
TRAVIS: I thought that might be happening. Yeah.
I'll tell you what, Max, sit tight. We'll be back

2514
02:49:20,555 --> 02:49:23,934
for you. Ivan, we'll try and find you another
player.

2515
02:49:23,934 --> 02:49:29,874
TALIESIN: "I, and I'll say, if you wanted to see
if you can figure out a little bit more about

2516
02:49:29,874 --> 02:49:33,054
"what's happening, can't win if you don't play."

2517
02:49:33,054 --> 02:49:35,974
TRAVIS: I mean, he has a good point.

2518
02:49:35,974 --> 02:49:36,894
SAM: Yeah.

2519
02:49:36,894 --> 02:49:38,173
LAURA: That's true.

2520
02:49:38,173 --> 02:49:43,877
TALIESIN: "Max, you want to pick another card?"

2521
02:49:43,877 --> 02:49:47,604
TRAVIS: Tell him to pick another card.

2522
02:49:47,604 --> 02:49:50,095
SAM: Make Max do it? No, we need to do it, so we
know.

2523
02:49:50,095 --> 02:49:52,855
TRAVIS: You're right. You're right, Sam.

2524
02:49:52,855 --> 02:49:54,339
SAM: You want me to do it?

2525
02:49:54,339 --> 02:49:57,118
TRAVIS: I mean, you had the inspiration. One of us
should pick a card.

2526
02:49:57,118 --> 02:49:59,114
LAURA: You should do it.

2527
02:49:59,114 --> 02:50:00,345
TRAVIS: It's you.

2528
02:50:00,345 --> 02:50:02,044
LIAM: You're certainly the most clever person at
the table.

2529
02:50:02,044 --> 02:50:03,629
LAURA: Yeah, you'll be able to solve it.

2530
02:50:03,629 --> 02:50:06,020
SAM: If I sit down though, will I be able to get
up again?

2531
02:50:06,020 --> 02:50:07,505
TRAVIS: Yeah, as long as Max is at the table.

2532
02:50:07,505 --> 02:50:09,337
TALIESIN: As long as Max doesn't get up.

2533
02:50:09,337 --> 02:50:11,551
SAM: All right. I'll draw a card.

2534
02:50:11,551 --> 02:50:13,280
TALIESIN: Sit down. Draw a card.

2535
02:50:13,280 --> 02:50:15,879
SAM: What could possibly go wrong?

2536
02:50:15,879 --> 02:50:17,746
LIAM: It can only go right.

2537
02:50:17,746 --> 02:50:21,145
LAURA: What'd you get, what'd you get?

2538
02:50:21,145 --> 02:50:26,148
SAM: The three of swords. More blood?

2539
02:50:26,148 --> 02:50:28,259
LAURA: Three bloods?

2540
02:50:28,259 --> 02:50:29,713
TALIESIN: Yeah, what are you at?

2541
02:50:29,713 --> 02:50:31,431
SAM: I'm at three.

2542
02:50:31,431 --> 02:50:33,257
LAURA: You have three bloods already?

2543
02:50:33,257 --> 02:50:35,837
LIAM: Uh-oh. Spaghetti-Oh.

2544
02:50:35,837 --> 02:50:40,477
LAURA: Oh no. You've maxed out your hunger.

2545
02:50:40,477 --> 02:50:50,618
TALIESIN: You stand up. Actually, I'm not even
going to bother with this. Ooh. Yeah, that's--

2546
02:50:50,618 --> 02:51:04,936
okay. You, at a speed that no one can even grasp,
you stand up, there's a blur, and before anyone

2547
02:51:04,936 --> 02:51:13,821
can notice, you are at zero health. You are fine.
Give me all your blood dice. Your blood is at zero.

2548
02:51:13,821 --> 02:51:15,351
LIAM: You're not hungry any more.

2549
02:51:15,351 --> 02:51:16,698
TALIESIN: You're not hungry at all.

2550
02:51:16,698 --> 02:51:17,719
LIAM: At all?

2551
02:51:17,719 --> 02:51:18,744
SAM: What happened?

2552
02:51:18,744 --> 02:51:19,901
TALIESIN: You're not hungry.

2553
02:51:19,901 --> 02:51:21,901
TRAVIS: How does Max look?

2554
02:51:21,901 --> 02:51:24,726
TALIESIN: Max is very pale, and he's not moving.

2555
02:51:24,726 --> 02:51:26,499
LAURA: (gasps) You killed Max.

2556
02:51:26,499 --> 02:51:27,672
TRAVIS: You're fast as shit.

2557
02:51:27,672 --> 02:51:29,441
LAURA: Sam, you killed Max!

2558
02:51:29,441 --> 02:51:32,760
TRAVIS: Can I run over to Max and check his pulse
with my fingers on his carotid?

2559
02:51:32,760 --> 02:51:37,767
TALIESIN: The only reason Max isn't slumping over
is he's still glued to the seat.

2560
02:51:37,767 --> 02:51:42,922
SAM: (gruffly) I don't know what came over me.

2561
02:51:42,922 --> 02:51:45,004
TALIESIN: Max is dead.

2562
02:51:45,004 --> 02:51:47,897
LAURA: I'm going to take my dagger and try to stab
Ivan while he's distracted with all of that.

2563
02:51:47,897 --> 02:51:52,379
SAM: (yelling) It's on! Wait, I get a question, I
get a question first!

2564
02:51:52,379 --> 02:51:56,224
TRAVIS: We were going to get fucking knowledge
first! We were supposed to get knowledge!

2565
02:51:56,224 --> 02:51:58,413
TALIESIN: You go in and try and stab Ivan?

2566
02:51:58,413 --> 02:51:59,734
LAURA: I'm going to try to stab Ivan!

2567
02:51:59,734 --> 02:52:01,608
TALIESIN: All right. Let's do dex plus--

2568
02:52:01,608 --> 02:52:03,671
TRAVIS: Max died for nothing!

2569
02:52:03,671 --> 02:52:05,702
LAURA: He would have let you die! He wouldn't let
you leave!

2570
02:52:05,702 --> 02:52:07,317
SAM: What?

2571
02:52:07,317 --> 02:52:08,609
LAURA: You would have been stuck here forever!

2572
02:52:08,609 --> 02:52:10,375
LIAM: But we could have used him and gotten an
answer.

2573
02:52:10,375 --> 02:52:12,057
TRAVIS: He was already up out of the chair.

2574
02:52:12,057 --> 02:52:14,608
TALIESIN: You still get a question. We'll see how
it goes. Dex plus melee.

2575
02:52:14,608 --> 02:52:15,838
LAURA: Dex plus melee?

2576
02:52:15,838 --> 02:52:16,807
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2577
02:52:16,807 --> 02:52:17,957
LAURA: Melee, not brawl?

2578
02:52:17,957 --> 02:52:19,401
TALIESIN: No, you have a weapon.

2579
02:52:19,401 --> 02:52:20,442
TRAVIS: You do.

2580
02:52:20,442 --> 02:52:22,679
LAURA: Oh, really? That's so dumb.

2581
02:52:22,679 --> 02:52:24,538
TALIESIN: Yeah, take it.

2582
02:52:24,538 --> 02:52:26,313
LAURA: I didn't know that's what it meant.

2583
02:52:26,313 --> 02:52:30,146
TALIESIN: I'll tell you what. What's your level
two power?

2584
02:52:30,146 --> 02:52:32,514
LAURA: Obfuscate. Unseen presence.

2585
02:52:32,514 --> 02:52:34,143
TALIESIN: Oh, that's right. You're obfuscate.
Never mind.

2586
02:52:34,143 --> 02:52:35,964
LAURA: I could have done it before he realized
what I was doing.

2587
02:52:35,964 --> 02:52:39,675
TALIESIN: No. You can take a stab. See how it
goes.

2588
02:52:39,675 --> 02:52:42,319
LAURA: Cool. What? Strength plus melee?

2589
02:52:42,319 --> 02:52:43,852
TALIESIN: I'm letting you do dex melee.

2590
02:52:43,852 --> 02:52:45,937
TRAVIS: I like the impulse to violence.

2591
02:52:45,937 --> 02:52:47,082
TALIESIN: I love it.

2592
02:52:47,082 --> 02:52:51,188
SAM: But you know why she's doing this? It's
because we made a pact to stick together. She's

2593
02:52:51,188 --> 02:52:52,353
protecting me.

2594
02:52:52,353 --> 02:52:58,266
LAURA: That's definitely why I'm doing it, Sam.
Ooh! Three successes and a crit! Well, just one

2595
02:52:58,266 --> 02:53:01,910
ten. Not technically a crit, but all three were
successes.

2596
02:53:01,910 --> 02:53:07,001
LIAM: (singing) Shot to the heart, and you're too
late.

2597
02:53:07,001 --> 02:53:08,918
LAURA: God! That's so many dice.

2598
02:53:08,918 --> 02:53:15,656
TALIESIN: Three successes and crit? Two successes
and a crit. Okay. So I'm going to give you

2599
02:53:15,656 --> 02:53:23,949
success with point. You pin him with the blade to
the table.

2600
02:53:23,949 --> 02:53:25,442
LAURA: Oh, shit!

2601
02:53:25,442 --> 02:53:30,079
TALIESIN: "That's uncalled for."

2602
02:53:30,079 --> 02:53:34,688
LAURA: Well, you just seemed like you were
probably kind of mean.

2603
02:53:34,688 --> 02:53:39,639
TALIESIN: "This is really-- this is a lot. This is
a lot."

2604
02:53:39,639 --> 02:53:42,249
LAURA: I don't know what's going on, Ivan. I'm
sorry.

2605
02:53:42,249 --> 02:53:43,647
TRAVIS: Is he bleeding profusely?

2606
02:53:43,647 --> 02:53:44,727
TALIESIN: No.

2607
02:53:44,727 --> 02:53:46,825
LIAM: Is he bleeding at all?

2608
02:53:46,825 --> 02:53:47,905
TALIESIN: No.

2609
02:53:47,905 --> 02:53:50,144
TRAVIS: You know what they say about shit that
doesn't bleed.

2610
02:53:50,144 --> 02:53:52,949
TALIESIN: He's stuck to the chair, though.

2611
02:53:52,949 --> 02:53:55,655
LAURA: Yeah, well, at least maybe, Sam, ask your
question.

2612
02:53:55,655 --> 02:53:59,929
TALIESIN: "I feel like there's things that need to
be addressed before we get to a question. I want

2613
02:53:59,929 --> 02:54:01,441
"to play the game as much as anybody, but--"

2614
02:54:01,441 --> 02:54:05,477
LAURA: I mean, I'm just saying. The game is still
going on. I totally interrupted the game. You

2615
02:54:05,477 --> 02:54:08,419
know, we should just-- I just try to hold him on
to the chair. I'm just going to keep holding on.

2616
02:54:08,419 --> 02:54:10,735
TALIESIN: "No, can you help with this? This is a
lot."

2617
02:54:10,735 --> 02:54:13,635
LAURA: Yeah, no, I'm trying to let you go, but I'm
definitely trying to keep him in the chair. I'm

2618
02:54:13,635 --> 02:54:16,949
trying to let it-- you're not coming off of it.

2619
02:54:16,949 --> 02:54:19,038
TALIESIN: "These prop replicas are really well
made. This is not--"

2620
02:54:19,038 --> 02:54:21,815
SAM: Can I get off the chair that I'm on or no?

2621
02:54:21,815 --> 02:54:24,888
TALIESIN: Weirdly, the corpse is making it
possible at the moment.

2622
02:54:24,888 --> 02:54:30,818
SAM: Oh, okay. I'll stay there so we can ask our
questions or whatever.

2623
02:54:30,818 --> 02:54:32,218
LAURA: (whispering) Ask your question, quick.

2624
02:54:32,218 --> 02:54:34,882
SAM: Oh, yes, my question! Can we--

2625
02:54:34,882 --> 02:54:38,080
TRAVIS: Ivan, my wife is very careful about these
things.

2626
02:54:38,080 --> 02:54:43,186
TALIESIN: "I understand this has been a very
stressful time for everybody, but let's--"

2627
02:54:43,186 --> 02:54:44,639
SAM: I just killed Max.

2628
02:54:44,639 --> 02:54:46,015
TALIESIN: "Yeah, you did."

2629
02:54:46,015 --> 02:54:47,782
SAM: It's super stressful.

2630
02:54:47,782 --> 02:54:49,104
TALIESIN: "That wasn't cool."

2631
02:54:49,104 --> 02:54:50,083
SAM: Sorry.

2632
02:54:50,083 --> 02:54:54,422
TALIESIN: "That was really uncalled for. Like,
it's all fun and games, sure, and we poke you a

2633
02:54:54,422 --> 02:55:00,362
"little bit here. I'm going to poke you, but come
on! Jeez."

2634
02:55:00,362 --> 02:55:04,416
LIAM: I'm going to come up behind Laura and press
into her elbow and I'll press the blade in and use

2635
02:55:04,416 --> 02:55:10,368
Awe again and say: Ivan, I mean it's really all
about leverage, right? We need some information

2636
02:55:10,368 --> 02:55:13,507
and I feel like we've earned it.

2637
02:55:13,507 --> 02:55:15,361
TALIESIN: What's the roll for that?

2638
02:55:15,361 --> 02:55:16,859
LIAM: Charisma plus persuasion.

2639
02:55:16,859 --> 02:55:18,746
TALIESIN: This is going to be interesting. Is it
versus anything?

2640
02:55:18,746 --> 02:55:19,898
LIAM: No.

2641
02:55:19,898 --> 02:55:21,475
TALIESIN: Okay, charisma persuasion.

2642
02:55:21,475 --> 02:55:25,929
LAURA: Doesn't he have to take a hunger dice for
it?

2643
02:55:25,929 --> 02:55:27,303
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, he's going to take a hunger
die.

2644
02:55:27,303 --> 02:55:28,955
TRAVIS: You try to screw over your--

2645
02:55:28,955 --> 02:55:30,873
LAURA: I know, I'm sorry.

2646
02:55:30,873 --> 02:55:33,144
TALIESIN: Old habits, man.

2647
02:55:33,144 --> 02:55:35,384
LAURA: I'm really bad.

2648
02:55:35,384 --> 02:55:40,870
LIAM: Charisma plus persuasion and one hunger die.
All right, what do we got here? Nice.

2649
02:55:40,870 --> 02:55:44,684
LAURA: You just got to kill someone in order
to--

2650
02:55:44,684 --> 02:55:46,864
LIAM: I've got two successes.

2651
02:55:46,864 --> 02:55:51,082
TALIESIN: Oh. Yeah, he critted against you.

2652
02:55:51,082 --> 02:55:52,866
LIAM: Oh, that didn't work.

2653
02:55:52,866 --> 02:55:55,097
TALIESIN: That didn't work, but you're still going
to take your hunger die.

2654
02:55:55,097 --> 02:55:56,777
LIAM: Yeah, all right.

2655
02:55:56,777 --> 02:56:07,661
TALIESIN: "Come on, that's just not necessary.
What do you need to know?"

2656
02:56:07,661 --> 02:56:09,427
LAURA: What do you need to know?

2657
02:56:09,427 --> 02:56:12,117
TALIESIN: "Let's just deal with this."

2658
02:56:12,117 --> 02:56:18,785
SAM: What did we find out so far?

2659
02:56:18,785 --> 02:56:24,881
LAURA: We found that in order for the head to be
unlocked, we have to put something on it that

2660
02:56:24,881 --> 02:56:26,677
proves we know we're vampires.

2661
02:56:26,677 --> 02:56:27,778
SAM: What about the cross?

2662
02:56:27,778 --> 02:56:29,151
LAURA: We don't know that one yet.

2663
02:56:29,151 --> 02:56:32,842
SAM: What do we need to overcome the cross part of
the puzzle?

2664
02:56:32,842 --> 02:56:37,899
TALIESIN: "It's a sign of faith. Any kind of sign
of faith. God, that one should be obvious. You

2665
02:56:37,899 --> 02:56:45,928
"need some sort of sign of faith. There's a dozen
answers to that one. That one's the easy one. I

2666
02:56:45,928 --> 02:56:48,797
"mean, oh god, okay, that's, wow."

2667
02:56:48,797 --> 02:56:50,138
LAURA: Does it hurt?

2668
02:56:50,138 --> 02:56:52,427
TALIESIN: "What do you think? Does it look
like--?"

2669
02:56:52,427 --> 02:56:55,028
LAURA: It doesn't look like you're in a lot of
pain, I can't tell.

2670
02:56:55,028 --> 02:57:00,688
TALIESIN: "I'm upset. I'm angry. I didn't mean to
take it out on you. Actually, you stabbed me, I

2671
02:57:00,688 --> 02:57:02,448
"think you get a little bit of this."

2672
02:57:02,448 --> 02:57:04,343
LAURA: Yeah. Sorry, Ivan.

2673
02:57:04,343 --> 02:57:06,755
TRAVIS: Ivan are you like us?

2674
02:57:06,755 --> 02:57:12,007
TALIESIN: "I mean, I think of myself as a very
good roleplayer, so I'd like to think that."

2675
02:57:12,007 --> 02:57:14,347
SAM: Are you a vampire?

2676
02:57:14,347 --> 02:57:15,893
TALIESIN: "No."

2677
02:57:15,893 --> 02:57:17,354
LAURA: What are you?

2678
02:57:17,354 --> 02:57:24,831
TALIESIN: "Just me! I'm just clever and I want the
best game possible!"

2679
02:57:24,831 --> 02:57:26,238
LAURA: What's upstairs?

2680
02:57:26,238 --> 02:57:29,691
TALIESIN: "That's a pull."

2681
02:57:29,691 --> 02:57:35,329
TRAVIS: Can I go over to Max's corpse and pat down
his pockets to see if he's carrying anything cool?

2682
02:57:35,329 --> 02:57:37,040
TALIESIN: He's not carrying anything cool.

2683
02:57:37,040 --> 02:57:38,092
TRAVIS: Damn it, Max.

2684
02:57:38,092 --> 02:57:40,196
LIAM: You think we're at Burning Man right now,
don't you?

2685
02:57:40,196 --> 02:57:45,827
LAURA: I'm going to pull my dagger out of him, I
guess.

2686
02:57:45,827 --> 02:57:50,523
TALIESIN: It pops out, there's a little electric
flash, a few spiders crawl out.

2687
02:57:50,523 --> 02:57:52,692
(groaning)

2688
02:57:52,692 --> 02:57:55,132
TALIESIN: "Don't mind that; it's mostly flair."

2689
02:57:55,132 --> 02:58:00,542
TRAVIS: So aside from upstairs, we know pretty
much everything.

2690
02:58:00,542 --> 02:58:04,719
TALIESIN: "You guys have everything you need,
let's be serious here. If you really want to know

2691
02:58:04,719 --> 02:58:10,935
"another clue, I'd tell you that you've got a
cross, you've got the head. You need something

2692
02:58:10,935 --> 02:58:21,007
"cerebral, something grand, and you need something
of faith."

2693
02:58:21,007 --> 02:58:22,483
LAURA: Okay, yeah!

2694
02:58:22,483 --> 02:58:27,448
TALIESIN: "And I'd do it soon if I were you. The
sun's setting."

2695
02:58:27,448 --> 02:58:30,494
SAM: The sun's setting? That's a good thing,
though, that means we can go outside.

2696
02:58:30,494 --> 02:58:33,222
TALIESIN: "Yeah, and also means other things can
come in."

2697
02:58:33,222 --> 02:58:35,524
LAURA: Come in?

2698
02:58:35,524 --> 02:58:42,699
TALIESIN: "Let's remind you that if you see
anybody, the table's open, and I'd really like

2699
02:58:42,699 --> 02:58:44,356
"some new players."

2700
02:58:44,356 --> 02:58:46,946
LAURA: You got it. Sorry about the stabbing.

2701
02:58:46,946 --> 02:58:50,041
TALIESIN: "It happens."

2702
02:58:50,041 --> 02:58:54,718
SAM: We'll send some more players down here.
Thanks for your cooperation.

2703
02:58:54,718 --> 02:58:56,028
TALIESIN: "Thank you for playing."

2704
02:58:56,028 --> 02:58:59,033
TRAVIS: I make my way out of that room.

2705
02:58:59,033 --> 02:59:00,545
LAURA: Ditto, quickly.

2706
02:59:00,545 --> 02:59:08,502
TALIESIN: You come out, you pass the war room, the
meeting room, you pass the bookshelf.

2707
02:59:08,502 --> 02:59:10,602
LAURA: Did I see anything cool on the
bookshelves?

2708
02:59:10,602 --> 02:59:12,145
TALIESIN: Did you look in the bookshelf?

2709
02:59:12,145 --> 02:59:13,272
LIAM: You didn't.

2710
02:59:13,272 --> 02:59:14,286
LAURA: I didn't.

2711
02:59:14,286 --> 02:59:20,017
TALIESIN: Take a perception investigation or
perception occult.

2712
02:59:20,017 --> 02:59:21,717
TRAVIS: Occult?

2713
02:59:21,717 --> 02:59:24,665
TALIESIN: Yeah, whichever one strikes your fancy.

2714
02:59:24,665 --> 02:59:27,440
LIAM: Hail Satan!

2715
02:59:27,440 --> 02:59:29,544
SAM: Liam, did you see how fast I was?

2716
02:59:29,544 --> 02:59:31,457
LIAM: I didn't see you!

2717
02:59:31,457 --> 02:59:33,018
TRAVIS: Two successes.

2718
02:59:33,018 --> 02:59:36,326
TALIESIN: There's some cool shit in the cage,
man.

2719
02:59:36,326 --> 02:59:38,090
LAURA: Four successes!

2720
02:59:38,090 --> 02:59:41,018
TALIESIN: Four successes? There's some cool shit
in the cage.

2721
02:59:41,018 --> 02:59:42,681
LAURA: Five successes.

2722
02:59:42,681 --> 02:59:48,273
TALIESIN: What's in the cage? Where's my cage?
There's some stakes, there's a cross in the cage.

2723
02:59:48,273 --> 02:59:49,935
LAURA: Ooh, get that cross!

2724
02:59:49,935 --> 02:59:52,663
TALIESIN: You, on the other hand, with four
successes--

2725
02:59:52,663 --> 02:59:53,790
LAURA: Five.

2726
02:59:53,790 --> 02:59:56,155
TALIESIN: Five? Well, four was the--

2727
02:59:56,155 --> 02:59:57,502
TRAVIS: What you needed.

2728
02:59:57,502 --> 03:00:05,096
TALIESIN: There's a very old-looking book on the
top shelf that you don't recall seeing there

2729
03:00:05,096 --> 03:00:11,621
before. It's a small, black leather book with a
little bit of silver on it, and you can't make it

2730
03:00:11,621 --> 03:00:14,321
out, but there's something about it.

2731
03:00:14,321 --> 03:00:17,624
LAURA: I climb the shelves to get up to it.

2732
03:00:17,624 --> 03:00:20,649
TRAVIS: I'll take the cage and open it up. There's
a steak in there?

2733
03:00:20,649 --> 03:00:24,008
TALIESIN: They've got a bunch of props from the
last run--

2734
03:00:24,008 --> 03:00:27,634
TRAVIS: Is it a real steak or a rubber steak?

2735
03:00:27,634 --> 03:00:32,484
TALIESIN: It's Sagas of Sundry, and it's us, so
it's much cheaper for us to use real stakes. A

2736
03:00:32,484 --> 03:00:34,397
rubber stake, a rubber chicken.

2737
03:00:34,397 --> 03:00:37,578
LIAM and TALIESIN: Chattering teeth.

2738
03:00:37,578 --> 03:00:41,624
TRAVIS: I was going, "meat steak?"

2739
03:00:41,624 --> 03:00:44,826
SAM: Just a big T-bone, sitting there in a cage.

2740
03:00:44,826 --> 03:00:46,746
LIAM: We are in a Looney Tunes.

2741
03:00:46,746 --> 03:00:48,909
TRAVIS: I will take that stake, and I will also
take--

2742
03:00:48,980 --> 03:00:50,251
LIAM: A cross in there.

2743
03:00:50,251 --> 03:00:51,715
TALIESIN: There's a cross.

2744
03:00:51,715 --> 03:00:52,562
LAURA: Take the cross.

2745
03:00:52,562 --> 03:00:57,310
TRAVIS: Wait, can I take my shirt off--

2746
03:00:57,310 --> 03:00:59,513
TALIESIN, LIAM, and SAM: Always.

2747
03:00:59,513 --> 03:01:02,642
TRAVIS: And can I throw the shirt over the cross
to try and pick it up?

2748
03:01:02,642 --> 03:01:03,791
TALIESIN: Yes, you can.

2749
03:01:03,791 --> 03:01:05,233
SAM: Oh, he's a vampire.

2750
03:01:05,233 --> 03:01:06,958
TALIESIN: Clever. Interesting.

2751
03:01:06,958 --> 03:01:10,317
LAURA: Smart. He knows all these vampire things
because he watches werewolf movies, and vampires

2752
03:01:10,317 --> 03:01:11,615
attack them.

2753
03:01:11,615 --> 03:01:13,352
LIAM: I thought he was scared of scary stuff?

2754
03:01:13,352 --> 03:01:16,419
LAURA: No, he's into it. He's scared of ghosts.

2755
03:01:16,419 --> 03:01:20,335
SAM: He's seen The Lost Boys. I know that's true.

2756
03:01:20,335 --> 03:01:23,216
TALIESIN: You can't tell if it felt weird because
it felt weird, or felt weird because you expected

2757
03:01:23,216 --> 03:01:24,437
it to feel weird.

2758
03:01:24,437 --> 03:01:30,409
TRAVIS: Yeah. When my shirt is off, does my skin
sparkle at all?

2759
03:01:30,409 --> 03:01:44,172
TALIESIN: No more than normal. That body glitter,
it's nuts. There's a book, and it's a small, black

2760
03:01:44,172 --> 03:01:45,291
leather book.

2761
03:01:45,291 --> 03:01:46,564
LAURA: What does it have in it?

2762
03:01:46,564 --> 03:01:50,835
TALIESIN: On the cover is a skull with fangs.

2763
03:01:50,835 --> 03:01:53,006
LAURA: Hey, I bet this is a thing!

2764
03:01:53,006 --> 03:01:54,554
LIAM: It's a death note!

2765
03:01:54,554 --> 03:01:59,508
LAURA: Skull book. Does it tell me how to be a
vampire?

2766
03:01:59,508 --> 03:02:05,676
TALIESIN: You open it up, and it is entitled, "The
Telling of the Book of Nod."

2767
03:02:05,676 --> 03:02:07,348
TRAVIS: Oh god.

2768
03:02:07,348 --> 03:02:08,826
SAM: What's that?

2769
03:02:08,826 --> 03:02:14,576
TALIESIN: It's prose, and it's long, and it's hard
to read because it's been hand-inked, but there

2770
03:02:14,576 --> 03:02:21,021
seems to be a lot of interesting information here
about vampires, and about what they can do and who

2771
03:02:21,021 --> 03:02:22,229
they are.

2772
03:02:22,229 --> 03:02:24,159
LAURA: Do I learn anything cool about myself?

2773
03:02:24,159 --> 03:02:25,634
LIAM: Step one: Eat bloods.

2774
03:02:25,634 --> 03:02:27,580
TALIESIN: You can peruse it for a second.

2775
03:02:27,580 --> 03:02:28,750
LAURA: Yeah, I want to peruse it.

2776
03:02:28,750 --> 03:02:37,828
TALIESIN: Actually, let's do a fun one. Roll wits
linguistics, just because I'm a jerk.

2777
03:02:37,828 --> 03:02:39,555
LAURA: Wits and linguistics?

2778
03:02:39,555 --> 03:02:44,597
TALIESIN: Yeah, because it's a little weird, and
it's in old English. It's all left. See, you're

2779
03:02:44,597 --> 03:02:53,962
getting it. Thank you. That mouse skeleton is very
fetching, by the way. I like sitting here.

2780
03:02:53,962 --> 03:02:57,600
TRAVIS: You look handsomer.

2781
03:02:57,600 --> 03:02:59,778
LAURA: I shouldn't have said it was cocked!

2782
03:02:59,778 --> 03:03:02,090
LIAM: She rolled a cocked dice and got another
failure.

2783
03:03:02,090 --> 03:03:03,090
SAM: Two failures?

2784
03:03:03,090 --> 03:03:04,112
LIAM: Two failures.

2785
03:03:04,112 --> 03:03:05,243
SAM: Both red.

2786
03:03:05,243 --> 03:03:07,860
LIAM: One success. Both red. Two failures.

2787
03:03:07,860 --> 03:03:11,924
TALIESIN: How much hunger are you at right now?

2788
03:03:11,924 --> 03:03:13,359
LAURA: I'm at three hunger.

2789
03:03:13,359 --> 03:03:25,609
TALIESIN: Okay. Oh, good. You keep hitting three
hunger. Yeah, you read it, and there was something

2790
03:03:25,609 --> 03:03:33,863
about your power, but you couldn't absorb any of
the information. You actually are having a hard

2791
03:03:33,863 --> 03:03:36,141
time reading, thinking.

2792
03:03:36,141 --> 03:03:41,204
LAURA: I really need some food. You had to drink
all of Max's blood?

2793
03:03:41,204 --> 03:03:42,533
SAM: It was so good.

2794
03:03:42,533 --> 03:03:44,873
TALIESIN: You are not hungry right now, by the
way.

2795
03:03:44,873 --> 03:03:46,404
SAM: It was so <i>good</i>!

2796
03:03:46,404 --> 03:03:47,719
LAURA: I'm so hungry.

2797
03:03:47,719 --> 03:03:51,867
SAM: It was like a Brunello di Montalcino wine.

2798
03:03:51,867 --> 03:03:56,238
TALIESIN: At the moment, you're down three on
academics, occult, or lore.

2799
03:03:56,238 --> 03:03:57,595
LAURA: Oh god.

2800
03:03:57,595 --> 03:03:59,517
TALIESIN: That's gone until you eat.

2801
03:03:59,517 --> 03:04:02,122
LAURA: I'm down three, so I'm minus one on
academics?

2802
03:04:02,122 --> 03:04:03,543
TALIESIN: There's no minus. It's just nothing.

2803
03:04:03,543 --> 03:04:08,001
TRAVIS: Does she gain an additional blood die, or
anything?

2804
03:04:08,001 --> 03:04:14,584
TALIESIN: Not for that one, because she did okay.
Good for checking. You got the book, and you got a

2805
03:04:14,584 --> 03:04:16,056
couple of things.

2806
03:04:16,056 --> 03:04:18,102
TRAVIS: What did you find?

2807
03:04:18,102 --> 03:04:19,674
LIAM: Nothing.

2808
03:04:19,674 --> 03:04:22,761
SAM: Laura doesn't know how to read.

2809
03:04:22,761 --> 03:04:24,578
TRAVIS: Babe, what did you find?

2810
03:04:24,578 --> 03:04:25,928
LAURA: I'm so hungry.

2811
03:04:25,928 --> 03:04:27,449
TRAVIS: But what did you find up there?

2812
03:04:27,449 --> 03:04:28,793
LAURA: I found a book.

2813
03:04:28,793 --> 03:04:31,234
TRAVIS: You found a book? What does it say?

2814
03:04:31,234 --> 03:04:32,823
LAURA: I don't know. I'm so hungry.

2815
03:04:32,823 --> 03:04:36,153
TALIESIN: You hear a little bit of noise and
chattering from out in the front, but you don't

2816
03:04:36,153 --> 03:04:37,292
know where from.

2817
03:04:37,292 --> 03:04:38,444
SAM: There's chattering.

2818
03:04:38,444 --> 03:04:40,911
LAURA: Does it sound like people I could eat?

2819
03:04:40,911 --> 03:04:45,315
SAM: Let's get our weapons out and go face this
threat head on.

2820
03:04:45,315 --> 03:04:48,159
TRAVIS: Or we could try and solve this puzzle.

2821
03:04:48,159 --> 03:04:51,979
LAURA: What, like I gave it to you?

2822
03:04:51,979 --> 03:04:54,140
TALIESIN: Wits linguistics.

2823
03:04:54,140 --> 03:04:56,624
SAM: Why don't we solve the puzzle now, Liam? We
need a symbol of faith--

2824
03:04:56,624 --> 03:04:59,316
LAURA: And the book, I'm going to put on the
head.

2825
03:04:59,316 --> 03:05:00,545
LIAM: Three successes.

2826
03:05:00,545 --> 03:05:08,865
TALIESIN: Yeah, this is telling the story of
several brothers, and it's telling the story of

2827
03:05:08,865 --> 03:05:14,936
people disavowed by god, whose souls left their
body, and several brothers who went out upon their

2828
03:05:14,936 --> 03:05:21,641
own, and various families. It's a lot to take in.
It's going to be tough, but you're starting to get

2829
03:05:21,641 --> 03:05:25,615
the notion that this is an old story about the
origins of vampires.

2830
03:05:25,615 --> 03:05:30,964
LIAM: Here with the tabletop games on the wall of
board games.

2831
03:05:30,964 --> 03:05:32,388
TALIESIN: That's weird, isn't it?

2832
03:05:32,388 --> 03:05:34,857
LAURA: I wander out into the kitchen, looking for
somebody to eat.

2833
03:05:34,857 --> 03:05:39,138
TALIESIN: You can listen really hard and see if
you hear anything.

2834
03:05:39,138 --> 03:05:41,330
LAURA: I listen real hard. Do I hear anybody?

2835
03:05:41,330 --> 03:05:53,947
TALIESIN: Let's say perception awareness. I would
start looking. I would think about willpower, at

2836
03:05:53,947 --> 03:05:55,009
some point.

2837
03:05:55,009 --> 03:05:56,292
LAURA: I forgot I had that.

2838
03:05:56,292 --> 03:05:58,287
LIAM: I'm hungry, too. I'm going to help you
look.

2839
03:05:58,287 --> 03:06:00,384
TRAVIS: Sam and I will make our way out to the
puzzle.

2840
03:06:00,384 --> 03:06:04,988
LAURA: Ooh, that's good. Oh yeah, four successes.

2841
03:06:04,988 --> 03:06:17,397
TALIESIN: That's really good. There's a scuttling
sound upstairs in the Smart Girls offices. In Amy

2842
03:06:17,397 --> 03:06:20,822
Poehler's Smart Girls offices, you hear a
scuttling. A small scuttling.

2843
03:06:20,822 --> 03:06:25,276
LAURA: I'm going to quietly walk up the stairs. I
think it's a rat.

2844
03:06:25,276 --> 03:06:27,262
TRAVIS: Laura, where are you going? Upstairs is
dangerous.

2845
03:06:27,262 --> 03:06:28,825
SAM: Yeah, we're about to solve the puzzle.

2846
03:06:28,825 --> 03:06:33,589
LAURA: I need some food. I don't know where any
food is around here.

2847
03:06:33,589 --> 03:06:37,618
TRAVIS: In case it's dangerous, why don't we try
and solve the puzzle first? See what happens.

2848
03:06:37,618 --> 03:06:41,731
LIAM: I'm hungry, too, but could you wait for just
a minute?

2849
03:06:41,731 --> 03:06:42,952
TRAVIS and SAM: Wait.

2850
03:06:42,952 --> 03:06:44,363
LIAM: Just a minute.

2851
03:06:44,363 --> 03:06:51,582
TRAVIS: I'll take the cross covered with my
t-shirt, and without touching it, dump it on the

2852
03:06:51,582 --> 03:06:53,956
lower right-hand corner of the circle.

2853
03:06:53,956 --> 03:06:58,563
TALIESIN: It bubbles and blackens, and the whole
thing is humming even more.

2854
03:06:58,563 --> 03:07:05,958
LAURA: Should we use the book on the other one? Or
I could bust out one of my fangs.

2855
03:07:05,958 --> 03:07:11,876
TRAVIS: Don't you need that to eat more disgusting
rats with?

2856
03:07:11,876 --> 03:07:14,481
LAURA: Are you judging me now?

2857
03:07:14,481 --> 03:07:15,761
TRAVIS: The whole time.

2858
03:07:15,761 --> 03:07:20,524
LAURA: Have you not had any rats yet? You've had a
rat.

2859
03:07:20,524 --> 03:07:22,881
TRAVIS: No, have you?

2860
03:07:22,881 --> 03:07:24,459
LAURA: No, of course not.

2861
03:07:24,459 --> 03:07:26,077
SAM: I ate a <i>man</i>.

2862
03:07:26,077 --> 03:07:31,579
TALIESIN: And that was all I needed from this
game. Thank you, everybody.

2863
03:07:31,579 --> 03:07:34,978
TRAVIS: Try the book?

2864
03:07:34,978 --> 03:07:38,512
LAURA: Okay, cool. Yeah, we should try the book.

2865
03:07:38,512 --> 03:07:39,868
LIAM: Man, I'm hungry.

2866
03:07:39,868 --> 03:07:41,874
LAURA: He said it's cerebral. The book is a
cerebral thing.

2867
03:07:41,874 --> 03:07:54,705
TALIESIN: It boils and bubbles, and all the blood
burns off the door, and you hear a clank. The door

2868
03:07:54,705 --> 03:07:56,409
may be open; it may not be.

2869
03:07:56,409 --> 03:07:59,909
LAURA: See, I feel like I should eat before we go in
there. What if there's something bad in there?

2870
03:07:59,909 --> 03:08:01,305
TRAVIS: Okay, fair enough.

2871
03:08:01,305 --> 03:08:05,404
SAM: Do you want me to do my super speed and go
upstairs and see what that scuttling is?

2872
03:08:05,404 --> 03:08:07,419
LIAM: Yeah, that's a good idea.

2873
03:08:07,419 --> 03:08:18,652
TRAVIS: I also have a fair amount of hunger, so
between Chris, Audrey, and Arcade: should we call dibs?

2874
03:08:18,652 --> 03:08:22,508
TALIESIN: Wow, he turned so hard so quick.

2875
03:08:22,508 --> 03:08:24,352
SAM: You're eating them?

2876
03:08:24,352 --> 03:08:30,202
TRAVIS: They have a sign around their neck that
says "drink me." It says "drink me."

2877
03:08:30,202 --> 03:08:33,904
SAM: But if we beat the magic, they all come back
to life, right?

2878
03:08:33,904 --> 03:08:37,428
TALIESIN: There is the scuttling upstairs, still,
from the Smart Girls office.

2879
03:08:37,428 --> 03:08:40,491
LIAM: I feel like it would be good to have a
snack.

2880
03:08:40,491 --> 03:08:42,786
LAURA: What, one rat's going to feed us all?

2881
03:08:42,786 --> 03:08:47,125
LIAM: Guys, snack, up.

2882
03:08:47,125 --> 03:08:50,167
TRAVIS: How about Laura checks out the scuttling?

2883
03:08:50,167 --> 03:08:52,521
LIAM: I'm all right with that.

2884
03:08:52,521 --> 03:08:54,584
LAURA: Why are you doing this to me?

2885
03:08:54,584 --> 03:08:57,459
TRAVIS: Well, I just want to make sure that we're
safe.

2886
03:08:57,459 --> 03:09:02,057
LAURA: Baby, don't you love me?

2887
03:09:02,057 --> 03:09:05,263
TRAVIS: So much. Undying love.

2888
03:09:05,263 --> 03:09:08,826
LIAM: Everybody knows Travis loves you. It's
obvious.

2889
03:09:08,826 --> 03:09:12,198
TRAVIS: Yeah. Give it a look. I'll be right behind
you.

2890
03:09:12,198 --> 03:09:13,773
SAM: I'll come with you.

2891
03:09:13,773 --> 03:09:14,886
LAURA: Thanks, Sam.

2892
03:09:14,886 --> 03:09:18,445
TRAVIS: Is this Warcraft sword made of silver, or
anything?

2893
03:09:18,445 --> 03:09:30,615
TALIESIN: Probably not. Blizzard's awesome, but--
it bends a little bit, because it's steel. It's a

2894
03:09:30,615 --> 03:09:34,882
wall-hanger. It's beautiful.

2895
03:09:34,882 --> 03:09:39,883
LAURA: We walk upstairs quietly, stealthily. I'm
not going to use my full Unseen Presence, but I'm

2896
03:09:39,883 --> 03:09:41,764
going to Obfuscate.

2897
03:09:41,764 --> 03:09:45,594
TALIESIN: That one, you have to be still. You're
going to have to keep cover.

2898
03:09:45,594 --> 03:09:49,729
TRAVIS: That was the fart, Liam.

2899
03:09:49,729 --> 03:09:56,282
TALIESIN: Roll a d10 and tell me what you get.

2900
03:09:56,282 --> 03:09:57,223
LAURA: Any d10?

2901
03:09:57,223 --> 03:09:58,689
TALIESIN: Roll any d10.

2902
03:09:58,689 --> 03:10:00,427
LAURA: Six?

2903
03:10:00,427 --> 03:10:08,893
TALIESIN: You're fine, for the moment. There are
two people hiding underneath desks up there.

2904
03:10:08,893 --> 03:10:10,663
LAURA: (whispering) Do they smell good?

2905
03:10:10,663 --> 03:10:14,692
TALIESIN: They smell amazing. They smell really
good.

2906
03:10:14,692 --> 03:10:23,476
LAURA: Wait. (quietly) Hello? Is anybody up here?

2907
03:10:23,476 --> 03:10:29,059
TALIESIN: They peek out around the desk. It's a
guy and a girl.

2908
03:10:29,059 --> 03:10:32,025
SAM: Do we recognize them?

2909
03:10:32,025 --> 03:10:35,882
TALIESIN: I've been waiting for this joke all
night. It's the Smart Girls office. You have no

2910
03:10:35,882 --> 03:10:37,265
idea who these people are.

2911
03:10:37,265 --> 03:10:39,810
(laughter)

2912
03:10:39,810 --> 03:10:42,161
TALIESIN: I feel so bad.

2913
03:10:42,161 --> 03:10:53,314
LAURA: Hi. I don't know what's going on. I woke
up. There's scary things everywhere. Can we hide

2914
03:10:53,314 --> 03:10:54,671
in here with you?

2915
03:10:54,671 --> 03:10:57,593
TALIESIN: Make a--

2916
03:10:57,593 --> 03:10:59,314
LAURA: Performance?

2917
03:10:59,314 --> 03:11:01,822
TALIESIN: Yeah, give me charisma performance.

2918
03:11:01,822 --> 03:11:03,742
TRAVIS: Are we calling that a performance?

2919
03:11:03,742 --> 03:11:06,542
LAURA: Shut up. You're a dick.

2920
03:11:06,542 --> 03:11:08,574
TALIESIN: She books more than me, man. I ain't
going to say shit.

2921
03:11:08,574 --> 03:11:15,427
LAURA: See, there's so much risk every time I'm
rolling my hunger dice.

2922
03:11:15,427 --> 03:11:16,807
TALIESIN: I know.

2923
03:11:16,807 --> 03:11:18,271
LAURA: I don't like rolling for anything now.

2924
03:11:18,271 --> 03:11:20,155
TALIESIN: This is my favorite part of this game.

2925
03:11:20,155 --> 03:11:21,597
LAURA: God dang it.

2926
03:11:21,597 --> 03:11:25,986
LIAM: That's real good stuff. That's all success.
Every single one.

2927
03:11:25,986 --> 03:11:27,358
LAURA: Five successes.

2928
03:11:27,358 --> 03:11:29,910
SAM: And one red fail.

2929
03:11:29,910 --> 03:11:31,173
LAURA: One red fail.

2930
03:11:31,173 --> 03:11:32,261
TALIESIN: One red fail is fine.

2931
03:11:32,261 --> 03:11:33,572
LAURA: But a lot of success.

2932
03:11:33,572 --> 03:11:44,612
TALIESIN: Yeah, the one red fail is... if you're
thinking about eating them, it's going to take you

2933
03:11:44,612 --> 03:11:49,313
a second to get your composure. You're really
distracted, and you're having a hard time

2934
03:11:49,313 --> 03:11:53,433
focusing, but they bring you in.

2935
03:11:53,433 --> 03:11:58,706
LAURA: Hi. I crawl under the desk. Are they under
separate desks?

2936
03:11:58,706 --> 03:12:00,251
TALIESIN: No, they're both underneath the same
desk.

2937
03:12:00,251 --> 03:12:01,251
SAM: I'm coming in, too.

2938
03:12:01,251 --> 03:12:02,353
LAURA: Oh, this is Sam.

2939
03:12:02,353 --> 03:12:04,081
SAM: I'm a good person.

2940
03:12:04,081 --> 03:12:09,114
TALIESIN: "Neither of us have ever seen either of
you before in our lives."

2941
03:12:09,114 --> 03:12:11,688
SAM: I'm a fan of your boss.

2942
03:12:11,688 --> 03:12:15,739
LAURA: I huddle up next to the girl and act like
I'm really scared, and I bite her.

2943
03:12:15,739 --> 03:12:19,579
TALIESIN: You're going to have to make
conversation for a minute because of that one red die.

2944
03:12:19,579 --> 03:12:23,116
LAURA: Damn it. So anyway, you guys work at Smart
Girls?

2945
03:12:23,116 --> 03:12:25,731
TALIESIN: "We do. Actually, it's real interesting
what we do--"

2946
03:12:25,731 --> 03:12:28,520
SAM: Are you writing something or developing
something?

2947
03:12:28,520 --> 03:12:31,946
TALIESIN: "It's really complicated to explain, but
we do a lot of stuff--"

2948
03:12:31,946 --> 03:12:33,267
LAURA: And then I bite her.

2949
03:12:33,267 --> 03:12:34,419
TALIESIN: Okay, thank you.

2950
03:12:34,419 --> 03:12:36,786
(laughter)

2951
03:12:36,786 --> 03:12:37,765
TALIESIN: Bless you.

2952
03:12:37,765 --> 03:12:39,579
TRAVIS: Small talk, and then business.

2953
03:12:39,579 --> 03:12:45,634
TALIESIN: Give me dex plus two for this one.

2954
03:12:45,634 --> 03:12:47,565
TRAVIS: Do we hear a commotion?

2955
03:12:47,565 --> 03:12:56,203
SAM: As Laura bites, I'm going to take my XLR whip
and use it to subdue and put it around the neck of

2956
03:12:56,203 --> 03:12:57,806
the other one. I'm not hungry.

2957
03:12:57,806 --> 03:12:59,058
TALIESIN: Dex brawl.

2958
03:12:59,058 --> 03:13:01,024
SAM: Dex brawl.

2959
03:13:01,024 --> 03:13:02,516
TRAVIS: Can we hear any commotion?

2960
03:13:02,516 --> 03:13:03,730
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. You hear thumping.

2961
03:13:03,730 --> 03:13:07,418
LAURA: Three successes, one red fail.

2962
03:13:07,418 --> 03:13:12,511
TALIESIN: One red fail? It works. It takes a
second. You're not having an easy time with this,

2963
03:13:12,511 --> 03:13:13,946
but you're in there.

2964
03:13:13,946 --> 03:13:15,229
LAURA: I'm going to hold her down.

2965
03:13:15,229 --> 03:13:16,433
TALIESIN: How much are you draining?

2966
03:13:16,433 --> 03:13:19,591
LAURA: Well, I've got three hunger, so a lot.

2967
03:13:19,591 --> 03:13:24,758
TALIESIN: Are you going to try to get rid of all
three hunger? Roll a d10.

2968
03:13:24,758 --> 03:13:27,586
TRAVIS: Don't look at us. Follow your heart.

2969
03:13:27,586 --> 03:13:29,773
LAURA: Three.

2970
03:13:29,773 --> 03:13:33,314
TALIESIN: Yeah. Give me all of your hunger die.

2971
03:13:33,314 --> 03:13:36,448
LAURA: Oh god, I killed someone?

2972
03:13:36,448 --> 03:13:42,114
TALIESIN: You killed someone who worked for Amy
Poehler, and I want you to think about that.

2973
03:13:42,114 --> 03:13:43,639
LIAM: I bet that smarts.

2974
03:13:43,639 --> 03:13:45,772
(groaning)

2975
03:13:45,772 --> 03:13:47,417
LAURA: Take a hunger dice.

2976
03:13:47,417 --> 03:13:52,224
SAM: I rolled three successes for my garrotte.

2977
03:13:52,224 --> 03:13:54,839
TRAVIS: (laughing) For your strangulation?

2978
03:13:54,839 --> 03:14:02,476
SAM: I'm not trying to kill. I'm just trying to
subdue. Is it a dude?

2979
03:14:02,476 --> 03:14:03,908
TALIESIN: (strangled) It's a dude.

2980
03:14:03,908 --> 03:14:06,262
SAM: I lift him up and march him down the stairs
for my friends.

2981
03:14:06,262 --> 03:14:13,826
TALIESIN: Give me strength athletics on that one,
for rolling around, unless you want to burn some blood.

2982
03:14:13,826 --> 03:14:15,172
SAM: What is it, Laura?

2983
03:14:15,172 --> 03:14:16,489
LAURA: Don't tell anyone I killed this chick!

2984
03:14:16,582 --> 03:14:17,782
SAM: (whispering) I won't.

2985
03:14:17,782 --> 03:14:19,599
LAURA: Oh man.

2986
03:14:19,599 --> 03:14:21,537
SAM: Clean your mouth.

2987
03:14:21,537 --> 03:14:22,875
LAURA: I feel so much better.

2988
03:14:22,875 --> 03:14:24,105
SAM: Three successes.

2989
03:14:24,105 --> 03:14:26,607
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. You're dragging him down.

2990
03:14:26,607 --> 03:14:29,910
SAM: Don't make a sound.

2991
03:14:29,910 --> 03:14:32,080
LAURA: This is so dark!

2992
03:14:32,080 --> 03:14:45,854
SAM: And I am not going to kill you. And I bring
him downstairs and throw him at Liam. Have at him!

2993
03:14:45,854 --> 03:14:48,661
LIAM: Wow, you love me.

2994
03:14:48,661 --> 03:14:54,826
TALIESIN: Give me dex two.

2995
03:14:54,826 --> 03:14:56,681
LIAM: Dex two?

2996
03:14:56,681 --> 03:15:00,508
TALIESIN: Dex plus two dice. Yeah, sorry. I'm
still figuring some of this out. I have way too

2997
03:15:00,508 --> 03:15:01,696
many pieces of paper.

2998
03:15:01,696 --> 03:15:03,441
LAURA: Oh no, Travis, are you still hungry?

2999
03:15:03,441 --> 03:15:09,455
LIAM: Shit, shit! Two fails. One success, two
fails. One's a red.

3000
03:15:09,455 --> 03:15:19,300
TALIESIN: One red fail, and--? Yeah, you go for
it, but you somehow slip and you don't quite get

3001
03:15:19,300 --> 03:15:23,649
it together to get a good grab.

3002
03:15:23,649 --> 03:15:26,098
LIAM: I feel so crazed!

3003
03:15:26,098 --> 03:15:30,684
TALIESIN: Suddenly you start hearing a growling
coming from the other end of the building.

3004
03:15:30,684 --> 03:15:33,193
(snarling)

3005
03:15:33,193 --> 03:15:34,590
TRAVIS: From the where? Other end?

3006
03:15:34,590 --> 03:15:36,144
LAURA: From where?

3007
03:15:36,144 --> 03:15:37,396
TRAVIS: The front of the building?

3008
03:15:37,396 --> 03:15:40,998
TALIESIN: From the front of the building.
(snarling)

3009
03:15:40,998 --> 03:15:44,280
LAURA: We should get in the Twitch stage. We
should go in.

3010
03:15:44,280 --> 03:15:56,838
TALIESIN: As you walk, there's two, probably
ten-foot tall wolves slowly making their way into

3011
03:15:56,838 --> 03:15:57,613
the kitchen.

3012
03:15:57,613 --> 03:15:58,996
TRAVIS: Bipedal?

3013
03:15:58,996 --> 03:16:05,082
TALIESIN: They're quadripedic at the moment, but
it seems like there might be the option, and one

3014
03:16:05,082 --> 03:16:09,629
of them has some brilliant tattoo work up the
front arms.

3015
03:16:09,629 --> 03:16:14,455
LAURA: Oh my god, Rachel?! Rachel turned into a
werewolf!

3016
03:16:14,455 --> 03:16:16,449
LIAM: It's Romero!

3017
03:16:16,449 --> 03:16:21,086
TALIESIN: The two of them are starting to make
their way toward you.

3018
03:16:21,086 --> 03:16:26,534
TRAVIS: Wait. Let's try and communicate!

3019
03:16:26,534 --> 03:16:32,702
LAURA: Travis, they are going to kill us! We're
vampires! Werewolves hate vampires. You've seen

3020
03:16:32,702 --> 03:16:33,903
enough of those movies.

3021
03:16:33,903 --> 03:16:35,720
TALIESIN: You guys better go quick.

3022
03:16:35,720 --> 03:16:39,166
SAM: I'm going to take the Smart Girls boy and
throw him on the floor in front of us.

3023
03:16:39,166 --> 03:16:40,427
TALIESIN: Okay.

3024
03:16:40,427 --> 03:16:42,580
SAM: And then run into the Twitch room.

3025
03:16:42,580 --> 03:16:44,150
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to run into the Twitch
room.

3026
03:16:44,150 --> 03:16:49,288
TALIESIN: You're going to run into the Twitch
room? Everybody roll, because I've been wanting to

3027
03:16:49,288 --> 03:17:04,243
try this, where did it go? There it is! Roll wits
plus, where did it go? Roll, this is going to be

3028
03:17:04,243 --> 03:17:13,291
weird, roll wits plus, I'm trying to find the
thing to do with this. This is going to be weird.

3029
03:17:13,291 --> 03:17:21,917
Wits plus athletics. I'm trying something
interesting. Honestly, except for Sam. Sam doesn't

3030
03:17:21,917 --> 03:17:23,905
have to roll anything because you are fast as
fuck.

3031
03:17:23,905 --> 03:17:30,287
LAURA: You have the best. Three successes. Triple
sixes, creepy.

3032
03:17:30,287 --> 03:17:32,542
LIAM: Two successes.

3033
03:17:32,542 --> 03:17:34,959
LAURA: Oh no, what'd you do?

3034
03:17:34,959 --> 03:17:36,952
SAM: You got no successes on yours?

3035
03:17:36,952 --> 03:17:42,486
TRAVIS: Three successes and two fails, one of
which is red.

3036
03:17:42,486 --> 03:17:52,531
TALIESIN: Okay. The rest of you make your way into
the room. Travis is, for some reason, still

3037
03:17:52,531 --> 03:18:10,548
staring at that boy on the ground. The two wolves
make a jump and grab the boy. And start tearing

3038
03:18:10,548 --> 03:18:14,342
into him. Make a wits roll to get yourself out of
there.

3039
03:18:14,342 --> 03:18:26,127
TRAVIS: Another wits? Just wits? They're all red.
That's a success, a ten, and a one.

3040
03:18:26,127 --> 03:18:42,428
TALIESIN: What the fuck. Okay. Yeah, the door is
jamming on you a little bit. I mean, you're there,

3041
03:18:42,428 --> 03:18:48,489
you're on the door, it's jamming a little bit.
They're having a bit of an argument over who gets

3042
03:18:48,489 --> 03:18:54,069
to eat the kid, and there's a bit of a back and
forth. It's like a meet-cute.

3043
03:18:54,069 --> 03:18:57,899
TRAVIS: The wolf with the tattoos and the other
one with the shaved sides?

3044
03:18:57,899 --> 03:19:00,086
TALIESIN: Yeah, with the shaved sides, and they're
having a bit of a run.

3045
03:19:00,086 --> 03:19:02,163
LAURA: It's totally Ed and Rachel!

3046
03:19:02,163 --> 03:19:10,104
TALIESIN: Yeah, your success and your failure.
Yeah, give me a, boy. You can add wits athletics

3047
03:19:10,104 --> 03:19:14,004
or wits survival, and I would recommend burning
either some blood or some will or doing something.

3048
03:19:14,004 --> 03:19:16,175
I keep rolling like shit.

3049
03:19:16,175 --> 03:19:18,784
TRAVIS: I don't know how to burn will, but I'll do
whatever.

3050
03:19:18,784 --> 03:19:24,518
TALIESIN: You knock off a will. You can add
athletics or--

3051
03:19:24,518 --> 03:19:29,175
TRAVIS: I'll add athletics. Come on, athletics.

3052
03:19:29,175 --> 03:19:32,498
LAURA: Muscle your way through the door. Much
better?

3053
03:19:32,498 --> 03:19:35,664
TRAVIS: Five successes and one red failure.

3054
03:19:35,664 --> 03:19:41,966
TALIESIN: That's good enough. I'm going to say you
get to the other side of the door but, man, you're

3055
03:19:41,966 --> 03:19:45,092
not even going to look for a minute. You're going
to sit at the other side of that door and listen

3056
03:19:45,092 --> 03:19:51,252
as the two of them tear this poor kid to shreds.
He is jerky.

3057
03:19:51,252 --> 03:19:56,580
SAM: I love how he is a full adult male grown-up
employee, but he's a kid now.

3058
03:19:56,580 --> 03:20:02,148
TALIESIN: We're all kids once we're in the jaws of
a werewolf, man. Everybody's a kid once you're a

3059
03:20:02,148 --> 03:20:06,740
vampire. And you can hear the werewolves clawing
at the door.

3060
03:20:06,740 --> 03:20:11,805
LIAM: I grab Laura and say: Listen, he might die.
He might die, and if he's gone, you and I are

3061
03:20:11,805 --> 03:20:15,343
going to need each other. So you need to keep me
alive so I can protect you. And I use Presence:

3062
03:20:15,343 --> 03:20:16,790
Awe on her.

3063
03:20:16,790 --> 03:20:18,197
TALIESIN: All right, roll it.

3064
03:20:18,197 --> 03:20:26,494
LAURA: Don't you have to roll every time you use
it? So you risk getting another hunger dice!

3065
03:20:26,494 --> 03:20:29,612
TALIESIN: He gets a hunger dice if it works,
yeah.

3066
03:20:29,612 --> 03:20:37,219
LIAM: Four successes, one of which is a red die.

3067
03:20:37,219 --> 03:20:50,885
TALIESIN: Ah, wow. That's a good plan! It was good
enough that, let me double check.

3068
03:20:50,885 --> 03:20:54,458
LIAM: There is no versus on the sheet.

3069
03:20:54,458 --> 03:21:04,385
TALIESIN: Yeah. Actually, roll perception
willpower. Yeah, you're a vampire.

3070
03:21:04,385 --> 03:21:08,505
LAURA: Where's willpower?

3071
03:21:08,505 --> 03:21:12,943
TALIESIN: You've probably burned one of them
already. It's at the bottom left.

3072
03:21:12,943 --> 03:21:22,431
LAURA: Oh, okay, so I have three willpowers. Okay.
Success, success. Four successes.

3073
03:21:22,431 --> 03:21:23,948
TALIESIN: How many were you at, Liam?

3074
03:21:23,948 --> 03:21:31,662
LIAM: Four. One of them was red. It was a crit.
Well, I need two crits.

3075
03:21:31,662 --> 03:21:35,795
TALIESIN: I flipped a coin anyway because that's
how I enjoy the moment. I've got these great coins

3076
03:21:35,795 --> 03:21:39,882
and I'm glad I get to use them. Yeah, he makes
sense.

3077
03:21:39,882 --> 03:21:43,335
LAURA: Yeah, of course I'm going to make sure
you're okay!

3078
03:21:43,335 --> 03:21:48,708
LIAM: I mean if Travis doesn't come back, or if he
does come back! It's wise to keep me alive so I

3079
03:21:48,708 --> 03:21:50,311
can protect you.

3080
03:21:50,311 --> 03:21:56,748
LAURA: This doesn't make any sense, but so much
sense, at the same time. I will protect you, so

3081
03:21:56,748 --> 03:22:00,102
you can protect me. Okay? That's how it always
is.

3082
03:22:00,102 --> 03:22:01,553
TALIESIN: Meanwhile, Travis comes back.

3083
03:22:01,553 --> 03:22:04,893
TRAVIS: What are you talking about?

3084
03:22:04,893 --> 03:22:09,254
LAURA: Liam said I need to protect him, so he can
protect me. But the thing is, you're back, so you

3085
03:22:09,254 --> 03:22:10,663
can protect all of us.

3086
03:22:10,663 --> 03:22:12,883
TRAVIS: That's so funny, he kind of said something
similar to me!

3087
03:22:12,883 --> 03:22:15,243
LIAM: And you love Laura, so to keep her alive--

3088
03:22:15,243 --> 03:22:19,089
TRAVIS: Can I use my Aura: Perception to
understand what Liam is doing?

3089
03:22:19,089 --> 03:22:20,652
LIAM: Reverse math?

3090
03:22:20,652 --> 03:22:28,150
TRAVIS: It says "interplay of colors in an aura
provides insight into the subject's emotions."

3091
03:22:28,150 --> 03:22:32,503
TALIESIN: I'll say you can-- wait, I get to say
it! You can certainly try.

3092
03:22:32,503 --> 03:22:38,838
TRAVIS: Okay, you have to roll manipulation plus
willpower versus my perception plus empathy.

3093
03:22:38,838 --> 03:22:42,997
TALIESIN: It's that bottom left.

3094
03:22:42,997 --> 03:22:46,963
LAURA: We should block the door so that Rachel and
Ed can't get in here.

3095
03:22:46,963 --> 03:22:48,232
SAM: That was Rachel and Ed?!

3096
03:22:48,232 --> 03:22:50,057
LAURA: Yeah dude! Did you see the tattoos?

3097
03:22:50,057 --> 03:22:51,104
SAM: Oh my god!

3098
03:22:51,104 --> 03:22:56,008
LAURA: While they're doing this, I'm going to push
one of the heavy things in front of the door.

3099
03:22:56,008 --> 03:23:01,799
TALIESIN: All right, I mean, I would say make a
strength check, but you guys probably together are

3100
03:23:01,799 --> 03:23:03,539
going to have no problem finding things to move.

3101
03:23:03,539 --> 03:23:05,233
TRAVIS: Four successes.

3102
03:23:05,233 --> 03:23:06,238
LIAM: Three.

3103
03:23:06,238 --> 03:23:08,856
TALIESIN: Three successes, four? You can read his
aura.

3104
03:23:08,856 --> 03:23:11,109
LAURA: What does that mean?

3105
03:23:11,109 --> 03:23:15,696
TRAVIS: It means insight into his emotions,
motives, and nature.

3106
03:23:15,696 --> 03:23:18,587
TALIESIN: Yeah, so what insight would you like?

3107
03:23:18,587 --> 03:23:21,696
TRAVIS: I'd like to know why he's asking everyone
to protect him.

3108
03:23:21,696 --> 03:23:23,804
LAURA: Because he wants to survive, man.

3109
03:23:23,804 --> 03:23:25,997
TALIESIN: Why are you asking everyone to protect
you?

3110
03:23:25,997 --> 03:23:27,204
LIAM: I need to live!

3111
03:23:27,204 --> 03:23:32,660
TALIESIN: There you go. I had a funny feeling it
would work out that way.

3112
03:23:32,660 --> 03:23:37,667
TRAVIS: You're asking my wife to look out for you if
it comes down to it?

3113
03:23:37,667 --> 03:23:39,739
LIAM: So I can protect her! Uh-huh.

3114
03:23:39,739 --> 03:23:40,959
TRAVIS: What about me?

3115
03:23:40,959 --> 03:23:44,463
LIAM: Well, you're stronger than me. How am I
going to protect you? That's silly.

3116
03:23:44,463 --> 03:23:48,132
TRAVIS: Right. Yeah. Makes sense. Where are we?

3117
03:23:48,132 --> 03:23:50,119
SAM: We're inside of the Twitch.

3118
03:23:50,119 --> 03:23:51,526
LAURA: We're inside the Twitch stages!

3119
03:23:51,526 --> 03:23:53,426
SAM: We're here, we're in this room.

3120
03:23:53,426 --> 03:23:54,584
LAURA: We're like, <i>right</i> here.

3121
03:23:54,584 --> 03:23:56,008
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're about 30 feet away.

3122
03:23:56,008 --> 03:23:57,316
TRAVIS: Can we take a look around?

3123
03:23:57,316 --> 03:23:58,350
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3124
03:23:58,350 --> 03:24:00,925
LAURA: I am going to Obfuscate.

3125
03:24:00,925 --> 03:24:04,776
TALIESIN: That's smart. Let's give you a little
bit of red.

3126
03:24:04,776 --> 03:24:08,170
LIAM: Tal, I never got a penalty for what I did.

3127
03:24:08,170 --> 03:24:10,633
TALIESIN: Yeah, you're going to get one right
there. You get one there.

3128
03:24:10,633 --> 03:24:14,078
TRAVIS: I'll use my heightened senses to--

3129
03:24:14,078 --> 03:24:19,200
TALIESIN: Oh wow, yeah. There are no people in
here, but all of the equipment is running and

3130
03:24:19,200 --> 03:24:23,415
there are some lights on back at the Critical Role
stage.

3131
03:24:23,415 --> 03:24:26,267
SAM: Are we live on Twitch?

3132
03:24:26,267 --> 03:24:35,025
LAURA: Oh, crazy. Are we like out there? How
fucking creepy would it be if we walked out?

3133
03:24:35,025 --> 03:24:37,424
TRAVIS: Fucking don't jump out and scare me. I
will attack whoever comes out here.

3134
03:24:37,424 --> 03:24:38,926
TALIESIN: That's good to know.

3135
03:24:38,926 --> 03:24:40,818
TRAVIS: If you jump out on me, it's not going to
go well for that person.

3136
03:24:40,818 --> 03:24:43,379
TALIESIN: Are you going to look around at all
other than like, as you walk over? There's little

3137
03:24:43,379 --> 03:24:44,608
nooks and crannies.

3138
03:24:44,608 --> 03:24:49,190
LAURA: I'm going to stay away from them so that I
can be sneaky.

3139
03:24:49,190 --> 03:24:51,792
TALIESIN: You're going to be sneaky. Which
direction are you going to come from?

3140
03:24:51,792 --> 03:24:56,182
LAURA: I'm going to go, well, there's really only
one way around. I'm going to go around this back

3141
03:24:56,182 --> 03:24:58,740
way, around that other stage so that, when they
come up this way--

3142
03:24:58,740 --> 03:25:01,944
TALIESIN: You do see a pile of corpses back
there.

3143
03:25:01,944 --> 03:25:04,131
LAURA: Oh shit.

3144
03:25:04,131 --> 03:25:10,283
TALIESIN: They look like very competent corpses,
the corpses of extremely competent people who make

3145
03:25:10,283 --> 03:25:12,075
things work.

3146
03:25:12,075 --> 03:25:13,129
SAM: Our crew.

3147
03:25:13,129 --> 03:25:18,401
LAURA: Oh, god. Like, around the other side of the
stage? Like they're hidden?

3148
03:25:18,401 --> 03:25:25,583
TALIESIN: They're kind of piled in the shoebox at
the moment. Also, make a perception check really

3149
03:25:25,583 --> 03:25:27,850
quickly, a base perception check.

3150
03:25:27,850 --> 03:25:33,476
LAURA: That's cocked, unfortunately. One success.

3151
03:25:33,476 --> 03:25:39,323
TALIESIN: Everything's been manhandled.
Everything's changed. Things have been moved

3152
03:25:39,323 --> 03:25:47,887
around. Everything's a little shifted. The
Wednesday Club table is leaning against the door

3153
03:25:47,887 --> 03:25:52,883
back here. People have been moved around. That's
my weird music.

3154
03:25:52,883 --> 03:25:55,690
LAURA: Yeah, I couldn't tell! It sounded like the
crew was making creepy noises!

3155
03:25:55,690 --> 03:26:10,014
TALIESIN: The Talks set has been folded away and
is in a little package. Everything's been strewn

3156
03:26:10,014 --> 03:26:12,416
through and there's some new-- go ahead.

3157
03:26:12,416 --> 03:26:20,725
LAURA: Can I look for my dice bag? My giant one
that's as big as a head. So I can roll, like, dice

3158
03:26:20,725 --> 03:26:22,082
on the ground if I need to.

3159
03:26:22,082 --> 03:26:27,344
TALIESIN: You know where to find it, so you go
look for it? As you open up the cabinet, there

3160
03:26:27,344 --> 03:26:38,046
seems to be some sort of, I don't know, it looks
like maybe it's a pyrotechnic device. It looks

3161
03:26:38,046 --> 03:26:42,820
like something designed to explode in the
cabinet.

3162
03:26:42,820 --> 03:26:48,476
LAURA: Like, it's going to explode if I touch it,
or I can take it?

3163
03:26:48,476 --> 03:26:50,573
TALIESIN: Do you touch things that look like
they're going to explode?

3164
03:26:50,573 --> 03:26:55,465
LAURA: Not usually. Is it close by my bag that I
need?

3165
03:26:55,465 --> 03:27:01,831
TALIESIN: It's near it, but I would not make you
roll to miss it, because it's far enough away.

3166
03:27:01,831 --> 03:27:08,116
It's on a different shelf. But there's a little
glowing light in there, connected to things that

3167
03:27:08,116 --> 03:27:13,679
definitely resemble some sort of dynamite or C4.
There's some sort of explosive device in here.

3168
03:27:13,679 --> 03:27:16,474
LAURA: I'm going to take my bag.

3169
03:27:16,474 --> 03:27:20,059
LIAM: Laura, where'd you go?

3170
03:27:20,059 --> 03:27:25,800
TALIESIN: You're Liam'ed, man. No one can see you.
You're the shade.

3171
03:27:25,800 --> 03:27:28,227
LAURA: I said I took it.

3172
03:27:28,227 --> 03:27:30,710
TALIESIN: You guys, where are you heading?

3173
03:27:30,710 --> 03:27:34,376
TRAVIS: Which way did you go? To the left? Oh, you
went to the right?

3174
03:27:34,376 --> 03:27:37,115
LAURA: Well, I got my dice and I was going to go
around, but I can come up this way.

3175
03:27:37,115 --> 03:27:40,810
TALIESIN: And she saw the giant pile of Chief and
Courtney.

3176
03:27:40,810 --> 03:27:44,584
TRAVIS: Oh, we recognize a few of the corpses?

3177
03:27:44,584 --> 03:27:50,098
TALIESIN: I mean, it depends on how-- Yeah,
probably. It's a good pile.

3178
03:27:50,098 --> 03:27:57,529
TRAVIS: I'll make my way toward the command center
where all the computers and tricasters.

3179
03:27:57,529 --> 03:28:05,231
TALIESIN: They're all running. There's somebody
sitting at the head of the table, but you can't

3180
03:28:05,231 --> 03:28:11,303
quite see. It's no one you recognize, and you
can't quite figure out who it is. There's a little

3181
03:28:11,303 --> 03:28:13,681
off-kilter.

3182
03:28:13,681 --> 03:28:18,118
LAURA: You're making sure nobody's going to jump
out at you?

3183
03:28:18,118 --> 03:28:20,172
TRAVIS: Yeah, I was entranced.

3184
03:28:20,172 --> 03:28:23,697
TALIESIN: Everything's a little off.

3185
03:28:23,697 --> 03:28:29,463
TRAVIS: I keep going up more.

3186
03:28:29,463 --> 03:28:33,326
TALIESIN: You see, painted in blood across the
outside of the set--

3187
03:28:33,326 --> 03:28:34,724
LAURA: This set?

3188
03:28:34,724 --> 03:28:38,119
TALIESIN: This set. "Life needs things to live."

3189
03:28:38,119 --> 03:28:45,745
LAURA: Oh my god, Taliesin's inside! Are you
inside this set?

3190
03:28:45,745 --> 03:28:52,176
TRAVIS: The person that I can't see. Hello?

3191
03:28:52,176 --> 03:28:59,425
TALIESIN: You see hair. There's a little tuft of
white hair and someone furiously writing notes.

3192
03:28:59,425 --> 03:29:05,521
TRAVIS: Excuse me, we just made our--

3193
03:29:05,521 --> 03:29:16,780
TALIESIN: "You made it! Oh, that's super." There
in front of you is a pale, older gentleman with a

3194
03:29:16,780 --> 03:29:24,303
bit of a beard and thin at the hair, but he's an
older gentleman. Quite pale and porcelain skin,

3195
03:29:24,303 --> 03:29:34,330
like he's definitely, I don't want to say "jolly"
vampire, but there's something so charming about him.

3196
03:29:34,330 --> 03:29:38,837
TRAVIS: Do we recognize his face?

3197
03:29:38,837 --> 03:29:50,419
TALIESIN: Make an intelligence, oh, what would I
call this? Either academics or occult.

3198
03:29:50,419 --> 03:29:56,462
LAURA: Are you all walking in the set?

3199
03:29:56,462 --> 03:29:59,131
SAM: Liam and I never said which way we had gone.

3200
03:29:59,131 --> 03:30:00,468
LIAM: No.

3201
03:30:00,468 --> 03:30:05,498
TRAVIS: That is two successes. Of three dice.

3202
03:30:05,498 --> 03:30:07,110
TALIESIN: Yeah, no.

3203
03:30:07,110 --> 03:30:13,629
LIAM: I think I would be a good ways behind big
man, watching him work his magic.

3204
03:30:13,629 --> 03:30:15,733
TRAVIS: I just rolled academics, nothing else.

3205
03:30:15,733 --> 03:30:25,807
TALIESIN: "I'm so glad to meet you. This is great.
I mean, there have been some problems, I admit it.

3206
03:30:25,807 --> 03:30:29,688
"There were some things that didn't really go the
way I wanted them to, but hey! Hey, you're here.

3207
03:30:29,688 --> 03:30:31,232
"Where's everybody else?"

3208
03:30:31,232 --> 03:30:35,527
TRAVIS: I'm sorry to interrupt you. Are you
responsible for the puzzle lock on the door?

3209
03:30:35,527 --> 03:30:40,378
TALIESIN: "Yeah, I mean, we're supposed to do a
thing, and I really enjoy these kind of things.

3210
03:30:40,378 --> 03:30:45,020
"Ivan was really happy to help, so we sort of--
Actually, Ivan really helped put it together. He's

3211
03:30:45,020 --> 03:30:46,116
"a smart kid."

3212
03:30:46,116 --> 03:30:49,078
TRAVIS: My name is Travis--

3213
03:30:49,078 --> 03:30:51,166
TALIESIN: "Oh yeah, I know. Hi. It's a pleasure."

3214
03:30:51,166 --> 03:30:52,418
TRAVIS: Pleasure. And you are?

3215
03:30:52,418 --> 03:31:04,231
TALIESIN: "My name's Gary. It's a pleasure. Gary
Gygax. I'm a big fan. It's really nice to meet you

3216
03:31:04,231 --> 03:31:06,861
"in person. This is great."

3217
03:31:06,861 --> 03:31:08,170
TRAVIS: <i>The</i> Gary Gygax?

3218
03:31:08,170 --> 03:31:10,046
TALIESIN: "I mean, that's fair to say."

3219
03:31:10,046 --> 03:31:14,047
LIAM: Gary Gygax is no longer living!

3220
03:31:14,047 --> 03:31:24,850
TRAVIS: Thanks, Liam! We found ourselves in a bit
of a situation. Do you happen to know what's going

3221
03:31:24,850 --> 03:31:26,189
on around here?

3222
03:31:26,189 --> 03:31:31,447
TALIESIN: "Yeah! And I've been looking forward to
you guys figuring out my puzzle and coming on in.

3223
03:31:31,447 --> 03:31:39,248
"This is great. I'm so excited about the next stage
of everything. This is really, super exciting."

3224
03:31:39,248 --> 03:31:41,726
TRAVIS: Is there anyone else in this studio at the
moment?

3225
03:31:41,726 --> 03:31:47,512
TALIESIN: "Probably not at the moment. I've got
some people outside, we're ready to load the

3226
03:31:47,512 --> 03:31:53,151
"trucks. Everything's up to go. Everything is more
or less set up. I've got some people, we've got

3227
03:31:53,151 --> 03:31:57,522
"some things coming in and out. There's a lot of
commotion. This is a big process."

3228
03:31:57,522 --> 03:32:01,009
TRAVIS: Outside? Forgive me, this is all very new
to me, but isn't the sun up outside?

3229
03:32:01,009 --> 03:32:05,789
TALIESIN: "For a minute longer, and then of course
Ivan can take care of that. He's very clever that

3230
03:32:05,789 --> 03:32:11,853
"way. But we have people. I mean, you'll know this
someday, you get to a certain point and you have

3231
03:32:11,853 --> 03:32:14,036
"people who can do these things for you. It's
really nice."

3232
03:32:14,036 --> 03:32:16,387
TRAVIS: Right. Sam? Liam? Laura?

3233
03:32:16,387 --> 03:32:19,858
SAM: I'm coming up and I'm going to say: Big
fan--

3234
03:32:19,858 --> 03:32:25,311
TALIESIN: "Thank you! See, the riddle was a double
thing, because, you know, vampires come from a

3235
03:32:25,311 --> 03:32:30,284
"box, and Dungeons &amp; Dragons comes from a box! It's
a double pun. I was really, it was actually Ivan

3236
03:32:30,284 --> 03:32:32,395
"who came up with it, but I signed off."

3237
03:32:32,395 --> 03:32:38,706
LIAM: Still not in, and I'm unscrewing two pipes
for a microphone setup so I can have a bar in my hand.

3238
03:32:38,706 --> 03:32:40,046
TALIESIN: It's smart to have.

3239
03:32:40,046 --> 03:32:43,998
LAURA: I'm creeping around the side and stealthily
peeking.

3240
03:32:43,998 --> 03:32:45,243
TALIESIN: Make an investigation check.

3241
03:32:45,243 --> 03:32:49,748
SAM: Is he on this set, or is he at the control
board?

3242
03:32:49,748 --> 03:33:02,238
TALIESIN: He's sitting right here. Make a
perception investigation. I'm excited to see if

3243
03:33:02,238 --> 03:33:03,642
you find this.

3244
03:33:03,642 --> 03:33:11,342
SAM: I'm going to pull out my Wyrmwood gaming tray
from under the table over there and hand it to him

3245
03:33:11,342 --> 03:33:12,598
and ask him to sign it.

3246
03:33:12,598 --> 03:33:14,493
TALIESIN: Oh, happily. He is into it.

3247
03:33:14,493 --> 03:33:17,010
LAURA: Six successes.

3248
03:33:17,010 --> 03:33:27,414
TALIESIN: There is a breeze coming from under the
Wednesday Club table.

3249
03:33:27,414 --> 03:33:29,776
LAURA: Like, here?

3250
03:33:29,776 --> 03:33:35,730
TALIESIN: Yeah. If you look behind the Wednesday
Club table, there is a tunnel going down

3251
03:33:35,730 --> 03:33:48,716
somewhere. So it's maybe a minute before the sun
goes down, but I'm saying someone's been getting

3252
03:33:48,716 --> 03:33:53,615
in or out of here no matter what the sun says.
Good find!

3253
03:33:53,615 --> 03:34:00,083
TRAVIS: Mr. Gygax, I'm not really sure what comes
next. Can you tell us a little bit about what we

3254
03:34:00,083 --> 03:34:01,438
have to look forward to?

3255
03:34:01,438 --> 03:34:06,458
TALIESIN: "Well, I was waiting till everybody was
going to be here, but everybody I'm sure is still

3256
03:34:06,458 --> 03:34:08,942
"having a time. It's a mess out there, I really
apologize."

3257
03:34:08,942 --> 03:34:10,750
SAM: You killed our dungeon master, so.

3258
03:34:10,750 --> 03:34:13,647
TALIESIN: "I mean, he's going to be fine, though.
He's going to be fine. "

3259
03:34:13,647 --> 03:34:16,949
TRAVIS: He turned to ash in the sun.

3260
03:34:16,949 --> 03:34:18,345
TALIESIN: "What?"

3261
03:34:18,345 --> 03:34:19,709
TRAVIS: Yeah, unfortunately--

3262
03:34:19,709 --> 03:34:23,358
SAM: Are you saying that once the magic is broken,
everybody comes back to life again?

3263
03:34:23,358 --> 03:34:25,122
TALIESIN: "No. What? Wait, where's Matt?"

3264
03:34:25,122 --> 03:34:30,760
TRAVIS: Matthew Mercer opened a curtain near the
front of the building and was struck by a ray of

3265
03:34:30,760 --> 03:34:36,658
sunlight. Is that not reversible?

3266
03:34:36,658 --> 03:34:50,700
TALIESIN: "I mean, I was aware that one of you
might-- something bad might happen, but we need him!"

3267
03:34:50,700 --> 03:34:52,493
TRAVIS: It's not just Matt.

3268
03:34:52,493 --> 03:34:55,407
SAM: We do need him for the show.

3269
03:34:55,407 --> 03:35:02,160
TALIESIN: "I mean, you guys ended everything! We
worked really hard to make sure you can keep doing

3270
03:35:02,160 --> 03:35:09,162
"this for as long as we need, and you let your
dungeon master walk into the sun! You guys are

3271
03:35:09,162 --> 03:35:16,038
"great. You're the best. God, ugh."

3272
03:35:16,038 --> 03:35:17,624
SAM: Before you freak out--

3273
03:35:17,624 --> 03:35:19,355
TRAVIS: I think it's past that a little.

3274
03:35:19,355 --> 03:35:22,149
TALIESIN: "What are you doing now that Matt's
gone?"

3275
03:35:22,149 --> 03:35:26,097
SAM: I've run a one-shot! I know how to DM!

3276
03:35:26,097 --> 03:35:31,360
TALIESIN: "That one-shot was, let's be fair, that
was mostly math and you were riding on the talent

3277
03:35:31,360 --> 03:35:33,016
"of your players. Let's be fair."

3278
03:35:33,016 --> 03:35:34,705
SAM: Liam's done a couple! Liam's pretty good!

3279
03:35:34,705 --> 03:35:38,101
LIAM: I'm not here. I'm quietly looking for Laura
outside of the Critical Role table.

3280
03:35:38,101 --> 03:35:40,106
TALIESIN: Is Liam dead too?

3281
03:35:40,106 --> 03:35:41,351
SAM: No, Liam's alive!

3282
03:35:41,351 --> 03:35:47,310
TALIESIN: "Or not, he's undead, apparently. We
went to all this trouble."

3283
03:35:47,310 --> 03:35:50,056
TRAVIS: Marisha turned to mushroom.

3284
03:35:50,056 --> 03:35:51,823
TALIESIN: "Oh, for God's sakes."

3285
03:35:51,823 --> 03:35:54,746
TRAVIS: There was tea, apparently, and she had
some.

3286
03:35:54,746 --> 03:35:59,531
TALIESIN: "Well, apparently you had some people
working here who weren't entirely human, and

3287
03:35:59,531 --> 03:36:05,065
"apparently we did our thing and things got weird.
You have some weird people here, you know that? God!"

3288
03:36:05,065 --> 03:36:06,679
SAM: We ate some of them, yeah.

3289
03:36:06,679 --> 03:36:08,515
LIAM: (whispering) Twinnie!

3290
03:36:08,515 --> 03:36:15,711
TALIESIN: "You know, you should never meet your
heroes. This is very disappointing."

3291
03:36:15,711 --> 03:36:17,541
TRAVIS: Was he calling us--?

3292
03:36:17,541 --> 03:36:21,098
SAM: I think that's a compliment. Weird,
backhanded compliment.

3293
03:36:21,098 --> 03:36:22,982
TALIESIN: "I was happy for a while. I don't even,
like--"

3294
03:36:22,982 --> 03:36:27,461
LIAM: Twinnie! Laura!

3295
03:36:27,461 --> 03:36:31,531
TALIESIN: I'm enjoying the fact that this is
everything I ever wanted, right there. This is

3296
03:36:31,531 --> 03:36:38,721
what it's like to be next to you, by the way.
Stealthy. "We had a plan. We had an underground

3297
03:36:38,721 --> 03:36:44,863
"bunker for you guys to shoot from. We were putting
together a new crew. We had every-- Oh my god, the

3298
03:36:44,863 --> 03:36:45,777
"money, and--"

3299
03:36:45,777 --> 03:36:47,818
SAM: You had to pay for this?

3300
03:36:47,818 --> 03:36:52,737
TALIESIN: "This was expensive, and I mean, there
are rules about what you can do, and I have done

3301
03:36:52,737 --> 03:36:57,583
"some things to make this happen that are a little
questionable."

3302
03:36:57,583 --> 03:37:10,252
SAM: A little? Well, you know, you could have
asked us to come play! Hey, wait! Wait! You're a

3303
03:37:10,252 --> 03:37:16,315
dungeon master! You could lead the game, right?

3304
03:37:16,315 --> 03:37:23,081
TALIESIN: "This is nothing personal, Sam. I just
really wanted to play with Matt."

3305
03:37:23,081 --> 03:37:33,389
(laughter)

3306
03:37:33,389 --> 03:37:42,930
TRAVIS: Dunked on by Gary Gygax! Posterized! The
burn is real! Sunbeam!

3307
03:37:42,930 --> 03:37:58,364
TALIESIN: He clicks a button on a remote. "Well,
regardless, it was really nice to meet you. I have

3308
03:37:58,364 --> 03:38:01,970
"something I'd love for you to sign. Well, you've
got about 60 seconds, so I figure we might as well

3309
03:38:01,970 --> 03:38:03,853
"get this done before everything goes."

3310
03:38:03,853 --> 03:38:05,417
TRAVIS: What happens in 60 seconds?

3311
03:38:05,417 --> 03:38:09,692
TALIESIN: "Well, I mean, we've got to clean up
everything, so. You're welcome to go outside if

3312
03:38:09,692 --> 03:38:12,671
"you like, but otherwise we're taking care of this
right now."

3313
03:38:12,671 --> 03:38:16,839
LAURA: I peek my head in right there where he
can't see.

3314
03:38:16,839 --> 03:38:21,038
LIAM: And I dive over to where she is. What do we
do?

3315
03:38:21,038 --> 03:38:25,074
TRAVIS: We would love to sign whatever it is.

3316
03:38:25,074 --> 03:38:26,413
SAM: We need a silver Sharpie.

3317
03:38:26,413 --> 03:38:32,210
TRAVIS: We're very particular about the metallic
colors. It's right over by the computers.

3318
03:38:32,210 --> 03:38:37,730
TALIESIN: "You're not trying to-- I mean, there's
nowhere to go, is there?" He starts to get up, and

3319
03:38:37,730 --> 03:38:39,621
he starts to grow claws.

3320
03:38:39,621 --> 03:38:42,043
SAM: I'm going to speed-dash toward Laura and
Liam.

3321
03:38:42,043 --> 03:38:47,060
TALIESIN: He's starting to get a little Baba
Yaga-y. There's claws coming out.

3322
03:38:47,060 --> 03:38:55,130
TRAVIS: Now, Mr. Gygax, there's really no need to
grow shit out of your hands. I merely want to sign

3323
03:38:55,130 --> 03:38:58,160
whatever-- What do you have for me to sign?

3324
03:38:58,160 --> 03:39:14,689
TALIESIN: He slowly reaches in and pulls out Matt
Mercer's Vecna statue. "You'll sign that, and I'll

3325
03:39:14,689 --> 03:39:16,087
"be taking it."

3326
03:39:16,087 --> 03:39:31,878
TRAVIS: I think that will be fine. I grab the
Vecna statue. You don't happen to have a pen on

3327
03:39:31,878 --> 03:39:33,420
you, do you?

3328
03:39:33,420 --> 03:39:46,180
TALIESIN: Let's flip. Oh! As he reaches for a pen,
suddenly, at great speed, there's a blur that

3329
03:39:46,180 --> 03:39:57,022
comes and smashes him against the side of the
wall. He is briefly dazed as you see there's

3330
03:39:57,022 --> 03:40:04,254
another vampire, teeth out, eyes blazing, holding
him against the wall, and he turns and looks at

3331
03:40:04,254 --> 03:40:12,083
you all, and Matt Colville says, "This is your
moment! Run! Run!" and goes in and holds Gary

3332
03:40:12,083 --> 03:40:13,837
Gygax against the wall.

3333
03:40:13,837 --> 03:40:14,885
TRAVIS: Where?!

3334
03:40:14,885 --> 03:40:15,848
SAM: Let's get out of here!

3335
03:40:15,848 --> 03:40:17,697
LAURA: Outside! Tunnel, I've got a tunnel! There's
a tunnel!

3336
03:40:17,697 --> 03:40:19,071
SAM: Let's go out the tunnel!

3337
03:40:19,071 --> 03:40:20,597
TRAVIS: No, he said there was a studio
downstairs!

3338
03:40:20,597 --> 03:40:23,319
LIAM: Blam, Blam, Blam!

3339
03:40:23,319 --> 03:40:25,324
TALIESIN: They're starting to wrestle with each
other.

3340
03:40:25,324 --> 03:40:27,031
TRAVIS: We run down the tunnel!

3341
03:40:27,031 --> 03:40:36,378
TALIESIN: You run? Man, just as you run down the
tunnel, Gary Gygax breaks his hold on Matt

3342
03:40:36,378 --> 03:40:39,944
Colville. They break apart and Gary makes a run
for the tunnel.

3343
03:40:39,944 --> 03:40:41,903
TRAVIS: Gary does, or Matt does?

3344
03:40:41,903 --> 03:40:43,633
TALIESIN: Gary. Matt's against the wall.

3345
03:40:43,633 --> 03:40:47,467
TRAVIS: I take the Vecna statue and I go, ah!

3346
03:40:47,467 --> 03:40:55,788
TALIESIN: It's enough to distract. Just in a
second if you all get underneath the Wednesday Club table--

3347
03:40:55,788 --> 03:40:58,743
SAM: We're going in.

3348
03:40:58,743 --> 03:41:03,878
TALIESIN: And you hear the flames as the air above
you lights, as Geek &amp; Sundry goes up in flames.

3349
03:41:03,878 --> 03:41:15,202
And we'll be back next week with your subterranean
adventures, now that you've killed two of the

3350
03:41:15,202 --> 03:41:17,373
greatest DMs-- Three of the greatest DMs that have
ever lived.

3351
03:41:17,373 --> 03:41:18,583
SAM: Two Matts dead.

3352
03:41:18,583 --> 03:41:21,131
TALIESIN: Two Matts dead, and a Gygax. Well done.

3353
03:41:21,131 --> 03:41:27,961
SAM: Yes, but the three new best DMs in the world
have survived, so.

3354
03:41:27,961 --> 03:41:31,580
TALIESIN: I feel like Gary was quite clear on
that.

3355
03:41:31,580 --> 03:41:34,733
TRAVIS: I have not killed any humans yet.

3356
03:41:34,733 --> 03:41:36,639
LAURA: Good for you, babe.

3357
03:41:36,639 --> 03:41:38,520
TALIESIN: You know what you get for that?

3358
03:41:38,520 --> 03:41:39,401
TRAVIS: What?

3359
03:41:39,401 --> 03:41:44,342
TALIESIN: Hungry, fucker. What are you at?

3360
03:41:44,342 --> 03:41:45,483
TRAVIS: That's five.

3361
03:41:45,483 --> 03:41:52,129
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, next time you see one, it's
going. Hey guys! I hope you enjoyed my-- I'm going

3362
03:41:52,129 --> 03:41:56,071
to be a little bit more together next time. This
was a little bit ramshackle.

3363
03:41:56,071 --> 03:41:57,191
TRAVIS: You were great!

3364
03:41:57,191 --> 03:42:01,993
TALIESIN: Thank you, I had fun. It's going to be a
little different. I'm going to play a little bit

3365
03:42:01,993 --> 03:42:04,526
more, we're going to have more fun with the social
and maybe get into a little bit of the World of

3366
03:42:04,526 --> 03:42:09,179
Darkness now that I feel like they've got a hang
on things. I'm going to give everyone a little

3367
03:42:09,179 --> 03:42:15,139
more power and a little more idea of what they can
do. Shift things around. We may have a special

3368
03:42:15,139 --> 03:42:21,728
guest. Maybe, maybe not, since it's only four of
you. I may get one more for fun. We'll see. I

3369
03:42:21,728 --> 03:42:27,079
haven't reached out yet because we have so much
shit to do over the next 48 hours, all of us.

3370
03:42:27,079 --> 03:42:29,030
LIAM: Yeah, everything else on pause.

3371
03:42:29,030 --> 03:42:34,196
TALIESIN: It's nuts. Thank you all for tuning in
to this. We are doing one more week of this insane

3372
03:42:34,196 --> 03:42:43,174
run, and it's going to get weirder. Probably less
evil? Maybe, I don't know. I'm so pleased. Thank you

3373
03:42:43,174 --> 03:42:51,000
guys so much. This system is a lot of fun to play,
and if you do get a chance, there's either the

3374
03:42:51,000 --> 03:42:55,642
classic or the new edition or both. Wonderful
treats. There's an alpha available to play with.

3375
03:42:55,642 --> 03:43:02,128
There's all of the old books, and they used to do
every city, every clan. I'd be very curious to see

3376
03:43:02,128 --> 03:43:08,239
if anybody could start guessing what clans I've
pushed everybody gently towards. Not that they

3377
03:43:08,239 --> 03:43:13,017
know anything yet. And if anybody figured out what
Ivan was, and if anybody figured out what was

3378
03:43:13,017 --> 03:43:18,378
happening at the front of the Geek &amp; Sundry
offices, and anybody figured out what-- I think

3379
03:43:18,378 --> 03:43:25,325
everybody figured out what happened with Ed and
Rachel. They might have survived, I don't know.

3380
03:43:25,325 --> 03:43:28,876
Werewolves are tough, man. Anyway, thank you guys
so much.

3381
03:43:28,876 --> 03:43:37,231
SAM: Thanks to our sponsor, Backblaze! Cloud-based
subscription. They back up software. Get it,

3382
03:43:37,231 --> 03:43:43,373
download it, and use backblaze.com/criticalrole to
get special other things.

3383
03:43:43,373 --> 03:43:46,001
TRAVIS: That's right. If you haven't tried it,
give it a try.

3384
03:43:46,001 --> 03:43:50,940
TALIESIN: And thank you to everybody at Geek &amp;
Sundry, Nerdist, Legendary, and Smart Girls for

3385
03:43:50,940 --> 03:43:56,209
giving me permission. I've been running through
