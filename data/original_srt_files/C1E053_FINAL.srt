00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:03,781
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:03,781 --> 00:00:10,299
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around, roll dice, and
play Dungeons and Dragons. We had quite an

3
00:00:10,299 --> 00:00:16,464
interesting episode last week, and leading into
more interesting possibilities this week depending

4
00:00:16,464 --> 00:00:21,321
on what happens. So, that being the case, let's go
ahead and try and get through these announcements

5
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:26,222
real fast so we can get to the game. First and
foremost, this is our second week of our fantastic

6
00:00:26,222 --> 00:00:29,824
Loot Crate sponsorship. Those of you who aren't
familiar with Loot Crate, they're an awesome

7
00:00:29,824 --> 00:00:34,273
company that produces monthly themed boxes that
contain a bunch of fantastic geek items from

8
00:00:34,273 --> 00:00:40,051
licensed gear, apparel, shirts, tchotchkes,
statues, all kinds of fun stuff, me and Marisha

9
00:00:40,051 --> 00:00:43,159
have been members for years, and it's actually
really, really cool stuff and they've been awesome

10
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:48,203
enough to take interest in our show and sponsor
us. To the point where, if you're interested in

11
00:00:48,203 --> 00:00:53,274
getting one, you can actually get three dollars
off a subscription by going to their website at

12
00:00:53,274 --> 00:00:59,740
www.lootcrate.com/criticalrole and put in the code
"criticalrole" to get your three dollars off your

13
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:06,170
subscription. It's legitimately really cool stuff.
And you should go check it out. Plus we get to

14
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,977
show them the strength of the Critter nation, you
guys go ahead and click on the link and say hello.

15
00:01:09,977 --> 00:01:11,493
TRAVIS: Yeah, mobilize.

16
00:01:11,493 --> 00:01:19,991
MATT: You also have until the 19th of this month
at 9:00pm to subscribe to receive the next month's

17
00:01:19,991 --> 00:01:24,879
Loot Crate in time, otherwise the cutoff happens,
and the next one looks pretty cool. So you guys

18
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:32,802
should definitely try and get into that window if
you can. Let me see. There is a-- oh! Our first

19
00:01:32,802 --> 00:01:39,023
"Dear Vox Machina" article went up last week,
answered by our fantastic Scanlan Shorthalt over there.

20
00:01:39,023 --> 00:01:41,029
MARISHA: So funny!

21
00:01:41,029 --> 00:01:43,866
MATT: You can find that on the Geek and Sundry
website. If you haven't had a chance to check it

22
00:01:43,866 --> 00:01:46,809
out, you can check it out on geekandsundry.com. We
have a new one coming out tomorrow--

23
00:01:46,809 --> 00:01:48,538
SAM: Featuring? Featuring?

24
00:01:48,538 --> 00:01:53,727
MATT: --featuring, do we know who it's featuring?
Do we know? Vax is helming that one next week, so

25
00:01:53,727 --> 00:01:59,564
that'll be fun. Check it out at geekandsundry.com
for Vax's answering questions sent to him by

26
00:01:59,564 --> 00:02:03,491
various people who live all about Tal'Dorei and
beyond.

27
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:04,841
LIAM: Let's have a heart-to-heart.

28
00:02:04,841 --> 00:02:06,627
MATT: Yeah, what could possibly go wrong?

29
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:07,898
TRAVIS: He walks away.

30
00:02:07,898 --> 00:02:10,161
MATT: Or hits them in the head with a--

31
00:02:10,161 --> 00:02:12,623
LIAM: I didn't answer any of them, I just left it
and took a walk.

32
00:02:12,623 --> 00:02:21,238
MATT: Perfect. I will be a guest at the end of
this month, the last weekend in May, at Momocon in

33
00:02:21,238 --> 00:02:25,974
Atlanta, as a reminder for all you southern
East-coast folks. Looking forward to coming there

34
00:02:25,974 --> 00:02:30,265
and doing some panels and such. And then the
weekend after that, the first weekend of June, I

35
00:02:30,265 --> 00:02:35,002
will be at Akon in Dallas, Texas. So for all you
Texas folk they just finally announced that.

36
00:02:35,002 --> 00:02:36,642
LAURA: Woo, Dallas.

37
00:02:36,642 --> 00:02:40,322
MATT: I'm going to these folks' old neck of the
woods. So if you're in that area, come say hi at

38
00:02:40,322 --> 00:02:44,676
Akon, be a lot of fun. Oh and Travis, you're going
to a convention next weekend.

39
00:02:44,676 --> 00:02:52,023
TRAVIS: Yeah, Laura and I will be at Puerto Rico
Comic Con next weekend. The 21st and the 22nd, or

40
00:02:52,023 --> 00:02:57,128
the 20th and the 21st, whatever Saturday and
Sunday is. We'll be there! Come squeeze us, we'll

41
00:02:57,128 --> 00:02:58,468
sign your books--

42
00:02:58,468 --> 00:02:59,541
LAURA: Squeeze us?

43
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:06,233
TRAVIS: Yeah, come squeeze us. Ahh, sushi burp.
Here we go, it'll be hitting you real soon.

44
00:03:06,233 --> 00:03:12,723
MATT: Everything shrivels. And Taliesin, you will
be at another convention as well.

45
00:03:12,723 --> 00:03:17,468
TALIESIN: I will, I will be at Amazing Comic Con
in Hawaii next weekend. Actually, I will be

46
00:03:17,468 --> 00:03:23,997
missing the game because I will be working on my
pale, in the moonlit shores of Hawaii.

47
00:03:23,997 --> 00:03:26,351
LAURA: I love how well your shirt and your hoodie
match your hair.

48
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:27,989
MARISHA: I know, it looks so pretty.

49
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:29,639
MATT: That is pretty slick, actually.

50
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:33,711
TALIESIN: Thank you. This is as fresh as I can
get. Because I've been sleeping in the studio.

51
00:03:33,711 --> 00:03:35,587
LAURA: It's pretty fresh. So fresh and so clean.

52
00:03:35,587 --> 00:03:38,326
MARISHA: You look like a Wicked and Divine
character. It's pretty great.

53
00:03:38,326 --> 00:03:40,732
LIAM: What color will you be next week?

54
00:03:40,732 --> 00:03:44,319
TALIESIN: You know, I think I'm going to stick
with the lavender for a while. I think I'm slowly

55
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,251
going to move it towards amethyst.

56
00:03:46,251 --> 00:03:49,848
MATT: Hey, I like it.

57
00:03:49,848 --> 00:03:51,502
TALIESIN: Little green, little blue.

58
00:03:51,502 --> 00:03:59,444
MATT: Also, as a note, Taliesin is the new host of
Signal Boost. The next run on the show that

59
00:03:59,444 --> 00:04:03,665
Marisha is the creator and co-producer on, writer,
all that other fun stuff.

60
00:04:03,665 --> 00:04:08,471
MARISHA: Along with Shaun Becker and Eric
Campbell. Couldn't do it without those guys.

61
00:04:08,471 --> 00:04:13,022
MATT: You had a fun promo go up this week as a
teaser for it. That was rather fun.

62
00:04:13,022 --> 00:04:15,998
MARISHA: Check it out. It's very good.

63
00:04:15,998 --> 00:04:22,610
MATT: Indeed. And I want to say, though it's only
been a couple days past, happy birthday to

64
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:27,593
Marisha. Happy birthday this past Tuesday to
Marisha.

65
00:04:27,593 --> 00:04:30,034
MARISHA: That was added after I sent out the
announcements.

66
00:04:30,034 --> 00:04:36,687
MATT: That was added right now because I'm your
boyfriend. But yeah, happy birthday.

67
00:04:36,687 --> 00:04:38,027
MARISHA: Aw, thanks, babe.

68
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,366
ASHLEY: We love our druid!

69
00:04:39,366 --> 00:04:40,424
MARISHA: Aw, thanks, guys.

70
00:04:40,424 --> 00:04:42,711
ALL: Huzzah!

71
00:04:42,711 --> 00:04:45,883
MATT: Speaking of birthdays, I believe there is a
gift to be given?

72
00:04:45,883 --> 00:04:49,535
LIAM: Yeah, I don't have an announcement, but I
have a bit of a surprise. This is a little bit

73
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:55,348
early, because my sister and I share a birthday on
the 28th. However!

74
00:04:55,348 --> 00:04:56,534
MARISHA: May birthdays!

75
00:04:56,534 --> 00:05:01,535
LIAM: It's a big month for birthdays, I'm a little
worried about the next episode or two, if we're

76
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:07,625
going to survive or not, so the gift that I have I
want to make sure you have it now, just in case.

77
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:10,637
It's very timely. Ryan, if you please.

78
00:05:10,637 --> 00:05:14,174
LAURA: What? What is this thing? Is it a baby bear
cub? Is it a real bear cub?

79
00:05:14,174 --> 00:05:16,182
MARISHA: Oh, yeah!

80
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:18,127
LAURA: (gasps)

81
00:05:18,127 --> 00:05:19,739
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

82
00:05:19,739 --> 00:05:21,873
MATT: That is fantastic.

83
00:05:21,873 --> 00:05:27,343
LAURA: Oh. My. Gosh. Shut your face!

84
00:05:27,343 --> 00:05:28,891
ASHLEY: Lookit! Look at what it says.

85
00:05:28,891 --> 00:05:30,872
LAURA: Happy birthday twinnie, fly high.

86
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:35,316
Thanks brother!

87
00:05:35,316 --> 00:05:38,428
MATT: All the barf. That's so cute!

88
00:05:38,428 --> 00:05:40,611
LAURA: Oh my god, I want to ride it around right
now.

89
00:05:40,611 --> 00:05:42,594
SAM: It's got a little bend in it for your butt!

90
00:05:42,594 --> 00:05:44,814
LAURA: Does it really fly though, that's the
thing.

91
00:05:44,814 --> 00:05:50,326
LIAM: I don't know, maybe have some padding or
mattresses out the first time you use it.

92
00:05:50,326 --> 00:05:52,228
LAURA: (squeals) Oh, this is so cool!

93
00:05:52,228 --> 00:05:54,086
LIAM: I also thought it would look nice in the
house.

94
00:05:54,086 --> 00:05:58,852
LAURA: It'll look so good in the house! It's so
perfect. It's going to go on the mantle.

95
00:05:58,852 --> 00:06:01,402
SAM: Hold it up a little higher so the people can
see.

96
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:04,804
LAURA: (sings) That was Ariel, singing Little
Mermaid.

97
00:06:04,804 --> 00:06:06,358
ASHLEY: (sings)

98
00:06:06,358 --> 00:06:07,838
LAURA: Keep singing!

99
00:06:07,838 --> 00:06:12,425
LIAM: I'm a big fan of all your decisions, keep
making them.

100
00:06:12,425 --> 00:06:18,616
LAURA: Thanks, brother. Thank you so much. I don't
have your gift for you here.

101
00:06:18,616 --> 00:06:20,469
LIAM: Whatevs.

102
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:24,490
SAM: She dropped it in a portapotty.

103
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,170
LAURA: Make him hold it!

104
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:31,987
MATT: Make Trinket hold a broom. This is going to
go perfectly. It does actually work!

105
00:06:31,987 --> 00:06:33,955
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah no, that's rockin'!

106
00:06:33,955 --> 00:06:35,611
MARISHA: That's perfect!

107
00:06:35,611 --> 00:06:37,740
ASHLEY: I love it so much.

108
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,469
LAURA: Thank you, that's so wonderful.

109
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:42,034
LIAM: You're welcome.

110
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:45,102
LAURA: Don't steal it, Trinket! You won't fit on
it.

111
00:06:45,102 --> 00:06:50,063
MATT: Anything else anyone wants to say or shall
we jump into it?

112
00:06:50,063 --> 00:06:52,567
MARISHA: I guess we should also say thank you,
Hardwick--

113
00:06:52,567 --> 00:07:02,459
MATT: Thank you Chris Hardwick for letting your
broom be stolen. "Letting." He still messages

114
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:08,843
occasionally, "Where's my broom?!" It's pretty
great. Anyway. That being the case, let's go ahead

115
00:07:08,843 --> 00:07:14,759
and jump into tonight's chaos for this episode of
Critical Role.

116
00:07:14,759 --> 00:08:45,782
[dramatic music]

117
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:54,207
MATT: Hello everyone. So, from last week's
episode. Vox Machina, our band of adventurers who

118
00:08:54,207 --> 00:09:00,172
have found their way into a struggle against a
group called the Chroma Conclave, a collection of

119
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:05,942
ancient chromatic dragons that have torn across
the landscape of Tal'Dorei and beyond, setting

120
00:09:05,942 --> 00:09:12,299
ruin to a number of major cityscapes and then
claiming areas as their own after the fact. In

121
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:18,728
order to combat this, eventually hopefully their
leader Thordak the Cinder King, a great and

122
00:09:18,728 --> 00:09:28,092
powerful red dragon, they've been in search of
ways to improve their prowess as heroes in search

123
00:09:28,092 --> 00:09:32,770
of these artifacts known as the Vestiges of
Divergence, lost from wars long past. After

124
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:38,449
finding information about these, it was also
discovered that one of their original homesteads,

125
00:09:38,449 --> 00:09:45,094
Westruun, the actual place where Pike and Grog,
for a large portion of his life, grew up, after

126
00:09:45,094 --> 00:09:53,374
being sieged by the dragons, had been overtaken by
the Herd of the Storm, of which Grog previously

127
00:09:53,374 --> 00:10:00,025
ran with for most of his life, and was helmed by
Kevdak, his uncle, a rather cruel and ruthless

128
00:10:00,025 --> 00:10:06,145
leader, after they had absorbed the River Maw
years beforehand that had swollen to a great size.

129
00:10:06,145 --> 00:10:11,935
Battled the dragon, and amongst their losses came
to an accord in which they would leave riches for

130
00:10:11,935 --> 00:10:18,672
the dragon and it would let them be for the time
being. Upon making their way into the town,

131
00:10:18,672 --> 00:10:28,342
thinning some of the ranks of this ravenous herd,
Travis as Grog threatened Kevdak to a battle

132
00:10:28,342 --> 00:10:34,939
one-on-one for supremacy of the herd, and quickly
may have gotten in a little over his head. In the

133
00:10:34,939 --> 00:10:38,684
center of the town square, a great battle
commenced, where after calling to his side his

134
00:10:38,684 --> 00:10:46,284
friends Vox Machina, a bloody fray that nearly
felled a few of you, through some ingenuity, some

135
00:10:46,284 --> 00:10:52,120
decent planning, and some trickery of magical item
use, you managed to survive and have Grog deal the

136
00:10:52,120 --> 00:11:01,012
death blow to Kevdak, amongst all of the watching
herd. After some barely scraping by diplomacy,

137
00:11:01,012 --> 00:11:08,225
managed to bring it all to a ceasefire for the
time being, freed Kevdak's son, your cousin

138
00:11:08,225 --> 00:11:16,944
Zanror, who from his bindings seemed to be of a
different mentality, emotional mindset than his

139
00:11:16,944 --> 00:11:23,595
father was, and is now wishing to-- with the two
of you, being Vox Machina and the remainder of the

140
00:11:23,595 --> 00:11:28,620
Herd-- bring this fight to the black dragon
itself, pulling themselves from under the thumb of

141
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:36,832
its rule, thus saving Westruun and your own lives
in the process. You all have brought to life one

142
00:11:36,832 --> 00:11:43,509
child who was lost in this fray, and are currently
escorting this boy northward towards the temple

143
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:54,877
district of Westruun, and that was where we left
off last time. So. As you guys recovered somewhat,

144
00:11:54,877 --> 00:12:02,349
some of your wounds, taken a breather, begin
walking through the now slowly unrolling streets

145
00:12:02,349 --> 00:12:07,846
of Westruun, some folks are coming out, some are
still staying in, because there are still various

146
00:12:07,846 --> 00:12:15,195
druids, warriors of a very aggressive nature
wandering the streets, though sparser than before,

147
00:12:15,195 --> 00:12:21,040
seeing you guys walk through, as many people do
recognize you through your previous exploits,

148
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:28,499
building a little sense of security they have not
had for the better part of a week. Making your way

149
00:12:28,499 --> 00:12:33,045
northward with this little boy, you eventually
find your way into the outskirts of the temple

150
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:39,719
district, the very familiar half-toppled stone
wall that in a circular way encompasses this

151
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:45,033
portion of the northwestern side of Westruun. What
would you like to do?

152
00:12:45,033 --> 00:12:51,918
ASHLEY: Well, I would like to make a proposition,
if everybody would like to take a rest, I know I'm

153
00:12:51,918 --> 00:12:58,418
pretty rough right now and maybe we could go see
if my great-great grandfather is okay.

154
00:12:58,418 --> 00:13:00,206
LAURA: Of course.

155
00:13:00,206 --> 00:13:02,183
MARISHA: We were in the process of--

156
00:13:02,183 --> 00:13:05,202
SAM: Escorting this boy to his home.

157
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:06,717
MARISHA: It was the three ladies, right?

158
00:13:06,717 --> 00:13:09,370
LAURA: But we'll bring him home, then we'll find
your grandfather.

159
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,537
ASHLEY: Yeah.

160
00:13:10,537 --> 00:13:13,263
LAURA: Or we can take him home and meet you.

161
00:13:13,263 --> 00:13:18,030
ASHLEY: Who-- how-- where is--

162
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:21,934
SAM: Little dead boy?

163
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,375
ASHLEY: Yes.

164
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:29,188
MATT: The little boy is still clutching on to
Trinket's fur, riding him behind you, he's got a

165
00:13:29,188 --> 00:13:33,624
little smile on his face, the dried blood still
covering half of his smile.

166
00:13:33,624 --> 00:13:38,349
LAURA: Does any of this look familiar to you,
darling?

167
00:13:38,349 --> 00:13:47,099
MATT: "Yeah. Mom should be up that way." And he
points further down the thoroughfare.

168
00:13:47,099 --> 00:13:49,215
ASHLEY: It's close.

169
00:13:49,215 --> 00:13:52,355
LAURA: Yeah. And your grandfather lives in this
area as well.

170
00:13:52,355 --> 00:13:53,237
ASHLEY: Yes.

171
00:13:53,237 --> 00:13:55,176
TALIESIN: Don't see why we can't do both.

172
00:13:55,176 --> 00:13:57,388
SAM: Swing by his house, yeah.

173
00:13:57,388 --> 00:14:02,038
MATT: "Giddy-up!" And he kicks the side, and
Trinket like, (grunts), lumbers forward.

174
00:14:02,038 --> 00:14:05,651
LAURA: I pat Trinket's butt. It's okay.

175
00:14:05,706 --> 00:14:11,669
MATT: Licks your hand begrudgingly and continues
forward, plodding on the cobblestone. For a while,

176
00:14:11,669 --> 00:14:16,918
eventually the boy, looking for familiar sights,
some of the buildings have taken some damage in

177
00:14:16,918 --> 00:14:22,851
the initial black dragon onslaught, he does
suddenly point his finger forward and goes,

178
00:14:22,851 --> 00:14:30,084
"That's it! That's it!" And you go past a couple
of humble buildings, and then you start getting

179
00:14:30,084 --> 00:14:35,451
into the slum section. I say slum, it's where the
poor people in the temple district live when

180
00:14:35,451 --> 00:14:43,071
they're not tending to temples or businesses that
are surrounded by this district. You can see it's

181
00:14:43,071 --> 00:14:50,618
a functional, it's a standing hovel, but it's
mainly a scrap wood roof, bits of thatch to help

182
00:14:50,618 --> 00:15:00,894
maintain any protection against rainfall. The wood
looks old, some of it may have been rotted, but

183
00:15:00,894 --> 00:15:06,209
treated since. It's functional. But the boy jumps
off Trinket.

184
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:07,644
LAURA: Oh, be careful!

185
00:15:07,644 --> 00:15:12,010
MATT: Doesn't even pay attention to you, runs up
to the door and hits the door and it's solid. He

186
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:18,073
goes and pulls on it and it seems to be closed, so
he goes, "Mommy? Mommy?" He seems genuinely

187
00:15:18,073 --> 00:15:20,501
excited, but also trying to get in the front
door.

188
00:15:20,501 --> 00:15:22,016
LAURA: I walk up behind.

189
00:15:22,016 --> 00:15:27,521
MARISHA: I whisper to Pike and be like, mm, we
didn't think about this potential outcome, did we?

190
00:15:27,521 --> 00:15:35,594
LAURA: Hello? Is anyone home? It's relatively
safe--er. Than it was.

191
00:15:35,594 --> 00:15:38,532
MATT: Time passes. What are you doing?

192
00:15:38,532 --> 00:15:40,357
ASHLEY: Can I check the door, if it's locked?

193
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:46,828
MATT: The door itself doesn't have a knob per se,
it has a small dark iron handle that's bolted to

194
00:15:46,828 --> 00:15:50,485
it, but you pull it and something's holding it
back, like there's something actually barring it

195
00:15:50,485 --> 00:15:52,096
from the other side.

196
00:15:52,096 --> 00:15:53,861
ASHLEY: That's a good thing.

197
00:15:53,861 --> 00:15:57,115
MATT: A few moments pass. Silence.

198
00:15:57,115 --> 00:16:01,295
MARISHA: Child, how long has it been since you've
been away from your home?

199
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:09,017
MATT: "They just pulled me out today." Then you
hear a voice come from the other side of the

200
00:16:09,017 --> 00:16:15,490
wooden door, peeking through the space. "Hello?"

201
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:18,251
LAURA: Knock-knock, we have your son, safe and
sound.

202
00:16:18,251 --> 00:16:19,851
MARISHA: Delivery.

203
00:16:19,851 --> 00:16:23,101
LAURA: Special delivery for child's mum.

204
00:16:23,101 --> 00:16:30,302
MATT: "Theodore?" And the boy goes, "Yes? Mom?
Please please please! There's nice people out here."

205
00:16:30,302 --> 00:16:36,533
And you hear the shifting of wood onto the
side, the door opens ever so slightly and on the

206
00:16:36,533 --> 00:16:46,478
inside you can see a pale and scared-looking
woman, clean, simple clothing, has some sort of

207
00:16:46,478 --> 00:16:55,923
half-torn apron on that's wrapped around a simple
peasant blouse. She has her hair up in this small

208
00:16:55,923 --> 00:17:03,164
cloth cap and she pushes through. "Theodore!"
Opens the door and picks him up and wraps him in

209
00:17:03,164 --> 00:17:08,395
her arms and holds him for a second, not even
paying attention to any of you, and there's this

210
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:14,302
moment where you can see the fear that has been
stuck in her mind since he was pulled from the

211
00:17:14,302 --> 00:17:19,826
inside of their abode slowly abated with the
return. Eventually she stops and her eyes come up

212
00:17:19,826 --> 00:17:27,755
over his shoulder to the rest of you. "I'm sorry,
pardon my manners, I'm Yulia. Thank you."

213
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:33,447
LAURA: Of course. Well.

214
00:17:33,447 --> 00:17:46,807
MATT: Puts Theodore down. "Hold on, let me--" She
goes and steps inside of her home. Eventually a

215
00:17:46,807 --> 00:17:51,088
few moments later she comes back and she has a
small handful of coins.

216
00:17:51,088 --> 00:17:52,927
LAURA: No, darling, put that away.

217
00:17:52,927 --> 00:17:55,145
MATT: "I-- it's the least I can do."

218
00:17:55,145 --> 00:17:56,557
TRAVIS: Is that it?

219
00:17:56,557 --> 00:18:00,005
LAURA: Truly, put that away.

220
00:18:00,005 --> 00:18:03,140
MARISHA: It's not what we did this for. It's fine.
We're just glad he's home safe.

221
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,849
LAURA: And not even slightly dead!

222
00:18:05,849 --> 00:18:07,524
MARISHA: Nope! Not a scratch!

223
00:18:07,524 --> 00:18:09,409
ASHLEY: He's fine, just nothing even happened.

224
00:18:09,409 --> 00:18:14,446
MARISHA: If he has weird dreams-- don't worry
about it. Children, you know.

225
00:18:14,446 --> 00:18:18,728
MATT: Her eyes are partially trained on Grog as
she now notices you, she steps further out of the

226
00:18:18,728 --> 00:18:21,806
house, she's like, "Is everything okay now?"

227
00:18:21,806 --> 00:18:23,298
LAURA: Oh yeah, he killed the bad guy.

228
00:18:23,298 --> 00:18:29,302
TRAVIS: We're under new management now, going to
be a lot of changes around here. For the better.

229
00:18:29,302 --> 00:18:37,665
MATT: "Okay. Thank you." She cups the coins back
into her hand, reaches down and rubs Theodore's

230
00:18:37,665 --> 00:18:42,229
hair, looks at the blood that's still there and
looks a little worried for a second.

231
00:18:42,229 --> 00:18:45,543
LAURA: I think it's paint, I think it might be
paint, they were painting.

232
00:18:45,543 --> 00:18:47,300
MATT: "Is he going to be all right?"

233
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,875
MARISHA: Oh yeah, he's great.

234
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:51,992
SAM: We had spaghetti for lunch.

235
00:18:51,992 --> 00:18:54,264
LAURA: Quite an adventure.

236
00:18:54,264 --> 00:18:56,249
MATT: "Thank you."

237
00:18:56,249 --> 00:18:59,632
MARISHA: Give him a little hot cocoa, warm
blanket, he'll be fine.

238
00:18:59,632 --> 00:19:03,486
MATT: "Better go clean you up. Go clean you up."
And he's like, "Okay!" And he runs in behind her

239
00:19:03,486 --> 00:19:06,103
as she turns again and takes the door and pauses
for a moment looking out at you and says once

240
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:09,718
again, very quietly under her breath, "Thank
you."

241
00:19:09,718 --> 00:19:17,822
LAURA: Have you-- sorry. Have you seen a small
elderly-- an older gnome?

242
00:19:17,822 --> 00:19:21,769
MATT: "Wilhand?"

243
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:24,249
LAURA: Yes, have you seen him, is he all right?

244
00:19:24,249 --> 00:19:28,080
MATT: "We've been staying inside since the
incursion came."

245
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,399
LAURA: All right.

246
00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:37,050
MATT: "The few that I have seen were not under
good circumstances. But the fact that I haven't

247
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,582
"seen him might be a good thing."

248
00:19:38,582 --> 00:19:39,618
LAURA: Yes.

249
00:19:39,618 --> 00:19:44,587
SAM: Do you know if they were hiding anywhere? If
anyone else went anywhere specifically to hide?

250
00:19:44,587 --> 00:19:52,265
MATT: "Not a lot of places to hide. Only certain
areas in the sewers are safe, and our homes are

251
00:19:52,265 --> 00:19:57,947
"the best places, if we knew our way around our own
homes. We had a hiding spot, but Theodore got away

252
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:03,539
"from us, hearing all the noise, and they managed to
take him away."

253
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:05,321
TRAVIS: Where did you hide?

254
00:20:05,321 --> 00:20:13,821
MATT: She brings you guys inside and it's very,
very plain in the interior, it's very cold, you

255
00:20:13,821 --> 00:20:21,074
can see there is a small firepit with a cauldron
over it that's used for making simple soups and

256
00:20:21,074 --> 00:20:25,053
whatever food they prepare in here. There is a
portion of the roof that is open to allow any sort

257
00:20:25,053 --> 00:20:31,458
of smoke to pass through, but it does have some
runoff to let any sort of water fall off outside

258
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:37,907
the window. She heads back behind where the cold
cauldron is, and where the stones are set up to

259
00:20:37,907 --> 00:20:43,862
guard the back from catching any of the wood
behind it, she goes and pulls on one of the pieces

260
00:20:43,862 --> 00:20:50,599
of stone, and as she pulls it back it's a false
front of stone that pulls open. There's a small

261
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:58,310
cabinet there that you see there used to be a--
religion check, for those who are trained in it.

262
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,739
Or who are skilled in it.

263
00:21:00,739 --> 00:21:02,372
LAURA: Trained in it.

264
00:21:02,372 --> 00:21:04,097
ASHLEY: You can try.

265
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:05,984
MATT: Have a proficiency.

266
00:21:05,984 --> 00:21:09,753
ASHLEY: 20.

267
00:21:09,753 --> 00:21:16,972
MATT: Okay. You see, even a quick glance, there's
a small broken statue that lies to the ground, and

268
00:21:16,972 --> 00:21:24,456
you can see the semblance of a destroyed shrine.
This back room was a shrine to Melora, and has

269
00:21:24,456 --> 00:21:31,870
since been seemingly tossed aside in the hurried
state of trying to protect one's family.

270
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:34,559
MARISHA: Can I reach down and pick up the statue?

271
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:41,838
MATT: It's in three pieces. As you pick it up, she
goes, "Oh, I'm so sorry, we--" She goes for your

272
00:21:41,838 --> 00:21:46,063
hand and goes, "I didn't-- hopefully she'll
forgive us, I know she will."

273
00:21:46,063 --> 00:21:48,435
MARISHA: Tell me about this deity.

274
00:21:48,435 --> 00:21:50,166
MATT: "Melora?"

275
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,623
MARISHA: Melora.

276
00:21:51,623 --> 00:21:56,327
MATT: And you've heard Melora, it's a whole
section of Vasselheim that is based around her

277
00:21:56,327 --> 00:22:03,401
sphere of influence, and she is actually where
most of the food in Vasselheim is grown in such a

278
00:22:03,401 --> 00:22:09,649
cold environment, her blessing is what allows the
land there to be fertile for crops from many

279
00:22:09,649 --> 00:22:10,853
different places.

280
00:22:10,853 --> 00:22:12,048
TRAVIS: Sweet.

281
00:22:12,048 --> 00:22:17,550
MATT: But she tells you, and you can see the
symbols too, the symbols that are carved in the

282
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:27,527
side of the stone are these swirls, almost like a
slow cascading spiral. She says, "Melora watches

283
00:22:27,527 --> 00:22:33,084
"over nature, she watches to make sure we have a
good harvest, she makes sure we don't get washed

284
00:22:33,084 --> 00:22:39,392
"away in the storms, she makes sure that the ships
to the far west make their passage across the

285
00:22:39,392 --> 00:22:51,395
"ocean, she looks out for us smaller folk and
brings vengeance upon those who attempt to destroy

286
00:22:51,395 --> 00:22:59,546
"our life." As she looks distantly out the open
door behind you into the city itself. "But anyway,

287
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:02,774
"I'll repair that."

288
00:23:02,774 --> 00:23:13,621
MARISHA: I might be able to help. Can I attempt--
hang on-- can I attempt a Mending spell on it?

289
00:23:13,621 --> 00:23:21,264
MATT: Yes, you can. You take a moment, close your
hands around it, close your eyes, and you can see

290
00:23:21,264 --> 00:23:28,112
what little bit of dried grass or moss that's
gathered at the edges of the stone all of a sudden

291
00:23:28,112 --> 00:23:33,188
spreads and encompasses all the pieces of stone as
you're holding it together. She takes a step back,

292
00:23:33,188 --> 00:23:40,101
her eyes full of wonder, as the moss then turns
dark brown, like a shell of soft vegetation, and

293
00:23:40,101 --> 00:23:44,403
then cracks and falls away, leaving behind the
stone statue in one piece.

294
00:23:44,403 --> 00:23:45,850
LAURA: That's sick!

295
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,312
TRAVIS: Sweet!

296
00:23:47,312 --> 00:23:56,798
MARISHA: I hand it over, and I tell her, I'm a
druid of the Ashari people and I know several

297
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:04,836
worshippers of Melora, but wasn't necessarily a
believer of her powers.

298
00:24:04,836 --> 00:24:07,067
MATT: "She protects you, too."

299
00:24:07,067 --> 00:24:10,049
MARISHA: And you're sure of this?

300
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:15,317
MATT: She looks over to her child, who's now
sitting on the side, pulled a couple of these

301
00:24:15,317 --> 00:24:18,650
wooden toys out from the side and is gathering
them in his arms and is grabbing all the things

302
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:26,388
that he missed while he was taken away, and she
says, "She brought you to me. She brought you to him."

303
00:24:26,388 --> 00:24:33,779
MARISHA: Why should I believe?

304
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:41,795
MATT: "She'll show you. In her own way."

305
00:24:41,795 --> 00:24:46,021
MARISHA: Thank you, my lady.

306
00:24:46,021 --> 00:24:51,676
MATT: She takes the statue and, "Well, if there's
anything else I can do for you."

307
00:24:51,676 --> 00:25:00,761
TRAVIS: Yes, actually. You should leave. I don't
mean that in the way that it sounded, sorry, back

308
00:25:00,761 --> 00:25:11,746
up. So, come tomorrow, there might be danger in
Westruun. You and your kin should go. In fact,

309
00:25:11,746 --> 00:25:16,837
anyone that you see, take them with you, there's a
little encampment not far from here.

310
00:25:16,837 --> 00:25:20,020
SAM: There is?

311
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:23,399
TRAVIS: Yeah, all the shanty area of people--

312
00:25:23,399 --> 00:25:24,795
SAM: Oh, oh, the refugees.

313
00:25:24,795 --> 00:25:28,704
MATT: They were south of here by Foromir Basin.

314
00:25:28,704 --> 00:25:30,394
SAM: South, north, northwest. South.

315
00:25:30,394 --> 00:25:38,429
TRAVIS: It's over by Foromir Basin. Head for that
if you can.

316
00:25:38,429 --> 00:25:40,342
SAM: Look for no trees.

317
00:25:40,342 --> 00:25:47,959
MATT: She takes a mental note. "No trees. All
right. I haven't been that far south. Should we

318
00:25:47,959 --> 00:25:51,982
"get the others, should we tell others to come with
us? If there is danger here--"

319
00:25:51,982 --> 00:25:56,689
SAM: We're going to fight here? I thought we were
going to do this out of town.

320
00:25:56,689 --> 00:26:05,231
TRAVIS: There's a fight coming here. You don't
want to be here. Don't be too obvious about it, on

321
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:11,965
the sly, if you can, but try and make your way out
of here before dawn tomorrow.

322
00:26:11,965 --> 00:26:21,642
MATT: "Okay, we will. Theodore? Start gathering
your things, we're taking a little trip."

323
00:26:21,642 --> 00:26:23,293
LAURA: A fun trip.

324
00:26:23,293 --> 00:26:27,364
MATT: He goes, "A trip! Yay!" And starts gathering
more of his things, he gets a pillow case and

325
00:26:27,364 --> 00:26:31,859
starts putting stuff into it. "We haven't done a
trip-- we haven't done a trip!"

326
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:34,691
"I know. Thank you."

327
00:26:34,691 --> 00:26:43,858
TRAVIS: On second thought, should we ask them to
leave on the sly, like, through the sewers? Just

328
00:26:43,858 --> 00:26:44,998
in case.

329
00:26:44,998 --> 00:26:46,529
MARISHA: I wouldn't make a show of it.

330
00:26:46,529 --> 00:26:48,802
TRAVIS: So maybe underground if they can.

331
00:26:48,802 --> 00:26:49,954
MARISHA: Yeah.

332
00:26:49,954 --> 00:26:52,426
TALIESIN: I think we're going to have-- are we
here? I can't remember.

333
00:26:52,426 --> 00:26:54,015
MATT: Yeah, you're all together.

334
00:26:54,015 --> 00:26:58,150
MARISHA: I thought we weren't either, I thought it
was just the girls but then everyone started talking.

335
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:03,403
LIAM: And then Grog was here. Reality is very
malleable.

336
00:27:03,403 --> 00:27:10,882
TALIESIN: I think we're going to have to have a
larger conversation about where everybody ends up

337
00:27:10,882 --> 00:27:20,104
in the very near future, and while two people in
and out of town is definitely agreeable, I think

338
00:27:20,104 --> 00:27:22,341
there's a larger discussion to be had.

339
00:27:22,341 --> 00:27:25,063
LIAM: I have an odd question for you.

340
00:27:25,063 --> 00:27:26,249
MATT: "Yes?"

341
00:27:26,249 --> 00:27:32,274
LIAM: Do you know of anyone still in the city who
would know their way about the sewers?

342
00:27:32,274 --> 00:27:42,439
MATT: "I mean-- usually the guards would go
through and make sure that the things that were

343
00:27:42,439 --> 00:27:48,484
"living down there weren't living anymore, but-- I
don't know anyone in particular that worked down

344
00:27:48,484 --> 00:27:50,523
"there. Sorry."

345
00:27:50,523 --> 00:27:52,318
LIAM: It's fine.

346
00:27:52,318 --> 00:27:53,691
SAM: I know someone.

347
00:27:53,691 --> 00:27:54,891
TALIESIN: You do?

348
00:27:54,891 --> 00:27:56,217
SAM: Yeah.

349
00:27:56,217 --> 00:28:00,063
MARISHA: Why don't we let this woman return to the
rest of her day?

350
00:28:00,063 --> 00:28:04,171
TALIESIN: We have more appointments as well. Much
to do today.

351
00:28:04,171 --> 00:28:06,473
LAURA: (whispering) One last question, this is it,
I swear.

352
00:28:06,473 --> 00:28:07,579
MATT: "Okay?"

353
00:28:07,579 --> 00:28:11,069
LAURA: Are you familiar with anyone in the farming
area just outside of town?

354
00:28:11,069 --> 00:28:15,342
MATT: "I've seen some folks come and go."

355
00:28:15,342 --> 00:28:20,065
LAURA: We're looking for a woman who was a
daughter of one of the gentlemen that worked in

356
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:24,170
the fields, and we really have no idea how to go
about finding her.

357
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:25,567
TRAVIS: (whispering) Reginald.

358
00:28:25,567 --> 00:28:27,274
LAURA: Reginald's daughter, yes.

359
00:28:27,274 --> 00:28:30,524
MATT: "Reginald's daughter. I'll ask."

360
00:28:30,524 --> 00:28:33,786
LAURA: All right. You know where to find us, we'll
be about.

361
00:28:33,786 --> 00:28:35,079
MATT: "All right."

362
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:37,056
TALIESIN: I think I know who to have that
discussion with as well.

363
00:28:37,056 --> 00:28:40,929
SAM: Good day. Oh?

364
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:46,030
ASHLEY: I go over to Theodore and-- I don't think
I have to bend down.

365
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:50,110
MATT: No, no, he's maybe half an inch shorter than
you.

366
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:56,466
ASHLEY: I had a little wooden doll, and so I'm
going to pass it to him and say, in case we never

367
00:28:56,466 --> 00:29:03,437
see you again, you can always think of us when you
play with this. That's for you. And you can name

368
00:29:03,437 --> 00:29:05,296
him whatever you want.

369
00:29:05,296 --> 00:29:07,152
MATT: "What's your name?"

370
00:29:07,152 --> 00:29:08,228
ASHLEY: Pike.

371
00:29:08,228 --> 00:29:14,137
MATT: "I will name you Pike." Throws it in the
pillowcase. Says, "Thank you!" Gives you a quick

372
00:29:14,137 --> 00:29:15,937
little kiss on the forehead.

373
00:29:15,937 --> 00:29:18,028
MATT: Pulling more things in the pillowcase.

374
00:29:18,028 --> 00:29:19,157
ASHLEY: Theodore!

375
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:21,222
LIAM: So much better alive than dead.

376
00:29:21,222 --> 00:29:23,519
LAURA: I know! I mean, good thing he never died.

377
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:28,290
LIAM: Hey, a rare ray of sunshine from the DM
today.

378
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:30,935
SAM: Let's continue on.

379
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,499
TRAVIS: Don't poke him.

380
00:29:32,499 --> 00:29:38,563
MATT: You guys say your goodbyes, she lets you go
and she locks the door behind and you gather

381
00:29:38,563 --> 00:29:44,529
they're making their necessary preparations. Where
to next?

382
00:29:44,529 --> 00:29:46,067
TALIESIN: Pike.

383
00:29:46,067 --> 00:29:47,895
SAM: To Wilhand's.

384
00:29:47,895 --> 00:29:49,291
ASHLEY: Follow me, please.

385
00:29:49,291 --> 00:29:58,429
MATT: All right. Not too far away, actually, you
come to the red brick homestead where Pike, Grog,

386
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:07,063
and Wilhand live. Mostly intact. The second floor,
which you guys are definitely familiar with--

387
00:30:07,063 --> 00:30:10,155
LIAM: Hey, I remember this place! Wow.

388
00:30:10,155 --> 00:30:14,661
MATT: --part of it has fallen in, doesn't look
like it's been set fire or any serious damage in

389
00:30:14,661 --> 00:30:18,430
that regard, some sort of nearby rubble or some
sort of impact caused part of the roof to collapse

390
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:29,265
from the outside. You come up to the front door.
It's currently locked.

391
00:30:29,265 --> 00:30:32,521
ASHLEY: That's a good sign. I think that's a good
sign.

392
00:30:32,521 --> 00:30:34,296
TRAVIS: Do you want to knock?

393
00:30:34,296 --> 00:30:35,525
ASHLEY: Yeah.

394
00:30:35,525 --> 00:30:39,945
MATT: No answer.

395
00:30:39,945 --> 00:30:41,659
LAURA: You have a secret knock you maybe used?

396
00:30:41,659 --> 00:30:44,850
TRAVIS: Maybe you should say who's knocking, just
in case. You do knock so strong.

397
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:52,067
ASHLEY: Pop-Pop Wilhand? It's Pike!

398
00:30:52,067 --> 00:30:53,781
TALIESIN: Well, I heard that.

399
00:30:53,781 --> 00:30:58,137
MATT: Nothing.

400
00:30:58,137 --> 00:31:01,232
LAURA: He might have very soft footfalls.

401
00:31:01,232 --> 00:31:02,717
TALIESIN: He might not be home.

402
00:31:02,717 --> 00:31:04,717
MARISHA: Is he old and hard of hearing?

403
00:31:04,717 --> 00:31:11,962
ASHLEY: A little, he could-- a little. Vax? Would
you mind? Maybe you'll get some luck with this door.

404
00:31:11,962 --> 00:31:17,663
MATT: Technically, Pike, you do have the keys to
the home.

405
00:31:17,663 --> 00:31:19,301
LIAM: I mean, I can do it if you want to.

406
00:31:19,301 --> 00:31:21,961
ASHLEY: Wait, hold on, I forgot that somewhere in
this armor--

407
00:31:21,961 --> 00:31:24,661
TALIESIN: No, he needs this, he needs this, it's
all right, absolutely needs this.

408
00:31:24,661 --> 00:31:26,332
SAM: I'll explode the door!

409
00:31:26,332 --> 00:31:33,304
ASHLEY: All that clanking is actually this key
moving about my armor. All right.

410
00:31:33,304 --> 00:31:35,534
MATT: Unlocks the door.

411
00:31:35,534 --> 00:31:37,429
LIAM: That key has seen a lot of miles.

412
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:39,742
MARISHA: Been around the world.

413
00:31:39,742 --> 00:31:41,564
MATT: You push and the door hits something.

414
00:31:41,564 --> 00:31:42,762
SAM: Damn it. Doors.

415
00:31:42,762 --> 00:31:44,994
MATT: It like budges maybe a quarter-inch.

416
00:31:44,994 --> 00:31:46,890
LAURA: He's barricaded the door, that's a good
thing, that's a really good thing.

417
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:53,092
ASHLEY: I go to the crack. Pop-Pop Wilhand! It's
Pike!

418
00:31:53,092 --> 00:31:55,577
LAURA: I go and look through the window, is there
a window?

419
00:31:55,577 --> 00:32:00,843
MATT: There is a window, there is cloth shuttered
around it, you cannot see in the inside.

420
00:32:00,843 --> 00:32:05,248
LIAM: And the hole in the roof. Could I get up
it?

421
00:32:05,248 --> 00:32:10,328
MATT: You could probably get up there if you
wanted. Go ahead and make a-- make an athletics check.

422
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:11,588
LIAM: All right.

423
00:32:11,588 --> 00:32:13,356
TALIESIN: Bugger all, I say we give it a shove.

424
00:32:13,356 --> 00:32:17,231
LIAM: Eh, 14.

425
00:32:17,231 --> 00:32:23,378
MATT: It takes you a few minutes, but you
eventually climb your way up, looking down into

426
00:32:23,378 --> 00:32:30,294
the second floor. Part of the roof is fully pushed
in, it looks like there's a piece of wayward stone

427
00:32:30,294 --> 00:32:34,296
that was ejected from an impact not too far from
here, possibly from one of the nearby temples,

428
00:32:34,296 --> 00:32:38,198
that ended up slamming through the roof. It's
partially embedded in the ground, the wood's

429
00:32:38,198 --> 00:32:43,386
splintered up around it, but it didn't hit the
bottom floor, it lodged itself in the floor of the second.

430
00:32:43,386 --> 00:32:45,920
LIAM: Hear anything, see anything inside?

431
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,931
LAURA: What do you see? Oh. Well.

432
00:32:48,931 --> 00:32:56,953
MATT: Are you at the bottom floor? Bottom floor,
all, there is some furniture that's busted, but a

433
00:32:56,953 --> 00:33:02,032
lot of the furniture's all been pushed right to
the front door. There's a giant barricade of

434
00:33:02,032 --> 00:33:07,146
mishmashed furniture that is jammed impossibly
into this front area.

435
00:33:07,146 --> 00:33:08,527
ASHLEY: He's very strong.

436
00:33:08,527 --> 00:33:10,312
TALIESIN: We're going to give a push to the front
door.

437
00:33:10,312 --> 00:33:14,234
MATT: More amusing when you consider that there's
a glass window right next to it that is not

438
00:33:14,234 --> 00:33:15,849
blocked at all, shuttered so carefully.

439
00:33:15,849 --> 00:33:20,277
LIAM: There's a window, there's nothing in front
of it, you want to come in the window?

440
00:33:20,277 --> 00:33:22,121
TALIESIN: We give a shove.

441
00:33:22,121 --> 00:33:23,467
MARISHA: We give a big shove.

442
00:33:23,467 --> 00:33:30,401
MATT: Make a strength check, with advantage we'll
say as you-- well, him, having advantage you're helping.

443
00:33:30,401 --> 00:33:32,290
MARISHA: Oh, him having advantage because I'm
helping.

444
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:35,302
TALIESIN: Oh. 18. Is my strength.

445
00:33:35,302 --> 00:33:40,112
MATT: 18. You guys have to slam it a few times,
and the impact lodges a few things loose. Come

446
00:33:40,112 --> 00:33:45,201
cascading down, causing a bit of a racket, but
eventually you manage to get it pushed open enough

447
00:33:45,201 --> 00:33:46,878
where you guys can squeeze through.

448
00:33:46,878 --> 00:33:49,854
LIAM: You just broke a chaise lounge, but come
in.

449
00:33:49,854 --> 00:33:52,802
LAURA: Pike, after you.

450
00:33:52,802 --> 00:34:00,026
ASHLEY: Okay. I step in and start looking around.

451
00:34:00,026 --> 00:34:05,921
MATT: Looking across the way, you see the
fireplace mantle has been ruined where the

452
00:34:05,921 --> 00:34:11,172
original small shrine to Sarenrae used to be,
looks like it's been knocked over and then put

453
00:34:11,172 --> 00:34:17,198
back together on top haphazardly, like it was
shattered and then was put up there and is

454
00:34:17,198 --> 00:34:24,230
delicately keeping its form by how it was laid.
The rest of the room is cold. It's quiet other

455
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,888
than your footfalls.

456
00:34:25,888 --> 00:34:28,928
ASHLEY: Can I check the bedroom?

457
00:34:28,928 --> 00:34:36,155
MATT: Okay. You go up to the bedroom area. As you
go up the stairs, you can see the giant piece of

458
00:34:36,155 --> 00:34:41,490
stone that's smashed in there, where the bed would
be in part of the bedroom area.

459
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:44,973
LAURA: Pike, did he have any hiding places, like
that other house?

460
00:34:44,973 --> 00:34:46,366
TRAVIS: I go with her.

461
00:34:46,366 --> 00:34:49,466
TALIESIN: I'm going to look around for personal
effects, papers.

462
00:34:49,466 --> 00:34:51,254
MATT: Make an investigation check, both of you
guys.

463
00:34:51,254 --> 00:34:53,778
LIAM: Is there a basement here, Pike?

464
00:34:53,778 --> 00:34:57,585
LAURA: 18.

465
00:34:57,585 --> 00:34:59,723
TALIESIN: 15.

466
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:01,129
MATT: What were you going to say?

467
00:35:01,129 --> 00:35:02,701
ASHLEY: There are hiding places.

468
00:35:02,701 --> 00:35:11,168
MATT: You guys go through the kitchen area, and as
you are looking about, moving stuff, in the pantry

469
00:35:11,168 --> 00:35:18,354
area there is a small wooden slat that is
partially moved across that leaves a small opening

470
00:35:18,354 --> 00:35:20,322
in the floorboards.

471
00:35:20,322 --> 00:35:22,663
LAURA: Percy! Wilhand?

472
00:35:22,663 --> 00:35:24,069
TALIESIN: Hello?

473
00:35:24,069 --> 00:35:27,796
MATT: "Shh! I'm not here!"

474
00:35:27,796 --> 00:35:31,015
TALIESIN: Pike, I've got good news, he says he's
not here!

475
00:35:31,015 --> 00:35:32,574
ASHLEY: Okay, I go running down.

476
00:35:32,574 --> 00:35:37,172
MATT: Okay, you run and you push stuff out of the
way. There's the one board that's slid open, all

477
00:35:37,172 --> 00:35:41,697
the rest of the boards are still loose and placed
over it. Do you just take the boards and toss 'em up?

478
00:35:41,697 --> 00:35:42,838
ASHLEY: I just pull them off.

479
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:45,761
MATT: As you pull the boards off, what little bit
of light has made its way from the window on the

480
00:35:45,761 --> 00:35:49,994
far end of the kitchen, you can see a bit of
glimmer off a set of glasses that immediately

481
00:35:49,994 --> 00:35:51,655
recoil in the shadow and go, "Oh!"

482
00:35:51,655 --> 00:35:53,773
ASHLEY: Pop-Pop Wilhand!

483
00:35:53,773 --> 00:36:00,742
MATT: "Pike? Oh my goodness." And his hand reaches
out and grabs yours and you pull him up and he's

484
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:06,898
covered in dust and dirt and he's probably been
down there-- the smell, probably been down there

485
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:08,121
for a few days.

486
00:36:08,121 --> 00:36:10,424
ASHLEY: I give him a big hug.

487
00:36:10,424 --> 00:36:16,794
MATT: You give him a big hug, he has long, ratty,
silver hair that's bald on the top, bowled on the

488
00:36:16,794 --> 00:36:24,789
sides, curled up and matted on the edges of his
shoulders. His normally nice light blue, sky blue

489
00:36:24,789 --> 00:36:30,920
shirt is torn in places and covered in dirt. He
has been living under the house for quite a while.

490
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:35,968
There's a little bit of dried food crusted on the
side of his chin. But he's there with a big ol'

491
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:39,668
hug. "Pike, I missed you so much."

492
00:36:39,668 --> 00:36:42,083
ASHLEY: I missed you so much, I'm so glad you're
okay.

493
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:47,737
MATT: "Look at you, look at you. Where'd you get
this scar? Oh."

494
00:36:47,737 --> 00:36:49,344
ASHLEY: Long story, we'll get there.

495
00:36:49,344 --> 00:36:52,076
MATT: "I want to hear this story-- and it's
Grog!"

496
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:53,636
TRAVIS: Hello Wilhand!

497
00:36:53,636 --> 00:36:57,753
MATT: Runs up, goes to give you a hug and goes,
"Oh! Come down, come down."

498
00:36:57,753 --> 00:37:00,165
TRAVIS: Oh, no-- yes. Take it easy.

499
00:37:00,165 --> 00:37:11,952
MATT: "You big guy." And his eyes go from really
warm to suddenly very cold, and he goes, "They

500
00:37:11,952 --> 00:37:16,065
"came back for me. They came back for me. I saw 'em
in the street."

501
00:37:16,065 --> 00:37:20,866
TRAVIS: I know, it's all right. It's all right,
Wilhand. It's all been taken care of.

502
00:37:20,866 --> 00:37:22,384
MATT: "They didn't find me though, they didn't
find me."

503
00:37:22,384 --> 00:37:23,319
TRAVIS: You hid.

504
00:37:23,319 --> 00:37:26,028
MATT: "I did, and they didn't find me at all.
There was no way they could find me. I know where

505
00:37:26,028 --> 00:37:27,331
"the secret places are."

506
00:37:27,331 --> 00:37:29,284
TRAVIS: I see where Pike gets her smarts from.

507
00:37:29,284 --> 00:37:30,635
ASHLEY: Yeah.

508
00:37:30,635 --> 00:37:34,471
MATT: "So. It's been a while! All of you!"

509
00:37:34,471 --> 00:37:39,202
MATT: And he starts going around and giving each
of you-- you guys got the hugs, he's giving you

510
00:37:39,202 --> 00:37:40,670
the formal like, "Oh, yes."

511
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:43,015
TRAVIS: This is Vex, this is Vax.

512
00:37:43,015 --> 00:37:44,868
LAURA: He knows us, Grog.

513
00:37:44,868 --> 00:37:46,334
MATT: "Yes, I remember."

514
00:37:46,334 --> 00:37:47,358
MARISHA: Keyleth, hello.

515
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:48,437
MATT: "Been a while."

516
00:37:48,437 --> 00:37:50,238
TALIESIN: I don't actually think we've met before,
hello.

517
00:37:50,238 --> 00:37:52,825
MATT: "No, you're unfamiliar to me. Nice to see
you again."

518
00:37:52,825 --> 00:37:53,880
SAM: Scanlan, Scanlan.

519
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:58,333
MATT: "Always nice to see a fellow gnome in these
parts. You are?"

520
00:37:58,333 --> 00:38:02,513
TALIESIN: Ah, Percival Frederickstein Von Musel
Klossowski de Rolo III, it's a pleasure to meet

521
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:05,030
you. Hello. Hi.

522
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,772
MATT: "Right!" And he pats your shoulder.

523
00:38:06,772 --> 00:38:10,316
TALIESIN: That took some doing, well done. I'll
lean down for that.

524
00:38:10,316 --> 00:38:15,865
MATT: "So. You need to hide too?"

525
00:38:15,865 --> 00:38:20,467
ASHLEY: There was a very big battle. And Grog beat
Kevdak.

526
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:21,721
TRAVIS: Yeah.

527
00:38:21,721 --> 00:38:26,760
ASHLEY: Chopped him in half! Straight down the
middle. Filleted him.

528
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:30,673
MATT: "I knew you would! You've always been the
strong one."

529
00:38:30,673 --> 00:38:33,296
ASHLEY: So everything's a little bit more
under control, hopefully.

530
00:38:33,296 --> 00:38:34,813
MARISHA: A little.

531
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:36,351
ASHLEY: Mm. Ish.

532
00:38:36,351 --> 00:38:38,074
MARISHA: Wilhand.

533
00:38:38,074 --> 00:38:39,235
MATT: "Yes?"

534
00:38:39,235 --> 00:38:43,386
MARISHA: Did they want something in particular
with you? Why did they want you?

535
00:38:43,386 --> 00:38:51,319
MATT: "Well, they went after me years ago, nearly
had me."

536
00:38:51,319 --> 00:38:54,316
MARISHA: I've heard the story, yes.

537
00:38:54,316 --> 00:38:55,667
MATT: "But I escaped."

538
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:56,733
MARISHA: I've heard.

539
00:38:56,733 --> 00:38:58,572
MATT: "I managed to flee, and took one of their
own with me."

540
00:38:58,572 --> 00:38:59,741
MARISHA: I know.

541
00:38:59,741 --> 00:39:01,275
MATT: "Nursed this one back to health, we did."

542
00:39:01,275 --> 00:39:02,488
TRAVIS: Thank goodness.

543
00:39:02,488 --> 00:39:08,147
MATT: "And I think I made 'em angry, so they came
to Westruun trying to get revenge on old Wilhand,

544
00:39:08,147 --> 00:39:11,775
"but no, too keen for that, these eyes have seen
the world!"

545
00:39:11,775 --> 00:39:13,863
MARISHA: You think the goliaths--

546
00:39:13,863 --> 00:39:15,334
LAURA: Yes, well of course they did!

547
00:39:15,334 --> 00:39:17,440
TRAVIS: Yep, that's the only reason they came
here.

548
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,296
LAURA: Who hasn't heard the legend of Wilhand?

549
00:39:20,296 --> 00:39:22,908
MATT: "Not many actually, I don't get out very
often."

550
00:39:22,908 --> 00:39:24,946
TALIESIN: They cry your name across the--

551
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:27,626
LAURA: The seven seas?

552
00:39:27,626 --> 00:39:30,659
MATT: "No no no no. Don't give me a big head about
it, it's fine."

553
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:32,566
SAM: I've written many a song about you, it's
true.

554
00:39:32,566 --> 00:39:39,940
MATT: "Well, if they're all dead, let's have a
meal!"

555
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:46,510
TRAVIS: Little misunderstanding, they're not all
dead. We unseated Kevdak.

556
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,049
MATT: "Okay."

557
00:39:48,049 --> 00:39:54,796
TRAVIS: He's dead. And so was the horrible bastard
who was pouring poison in his ear. But listen, I

558
00:39:54,796 --> 00:39:59,270
gave power up to the Herd, to Zanror, his son.

559
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:00,505
MATT: "Okay."

560
00:40:00,505 --> 00:40:04,006
TRAVIS: So it's in slightly better hands. Little
problem--

561
00:40:04,006 --> 00:40:05,088
MATT: "Right."

562
00:40:05,088 --> 00:40:10,045
TRAVIS: They want to stay and fight the dragon
that's going to come back.

563
00:40:10,045 --> 00:40:11,151
MATT: "Okay."

564
00:40:11,151 --> 00:40:16,866
TRAVIS: So we need everyone in here to leave.

565
00:40:16,866 --> 00:40:18,095
MATT: "Perfect."

566
00:40:18,095 --> 00:40:19,128
LAURA: Perfect?

567
00:40:19,128 --> 00:40:20,020
MATT: "Yes."

568
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,306
LAURA: Perfect in what way, leaving or fighting
the dragon?

569
00:40:22,306 --> 00:40:25,510
MATT: "Dragon? What?!"

570
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,805
TRAVIS: Sorry, yes.

571
00:40:26,805 --> 00:40:28,619
MARISHA: You were aware, right?

572
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:31,098
MATT: (terrified noise)

573
00:40:31,098 --> 00:40:34,102
MARISHA: Okay. Yes. Yes, that one.

574
00:40:34,102 --> 00:40:37,362
MATT: And he starts walking back towards the
hole.

575
00:40:37,362 --> 00:40:40,172
ALL: No, no no no!

576
00:40:40,172 --> 00:40:45,551
TRAVIS: I grab the back of his britches and I pull
him back. Nope, nope, Wilhand.

577
00:40:45,551 --> 00:40:52,417
ASHLEY: Hey, guess what though? We've fought many
dragons already. And guess what, I killed one!

578
00:40:52,417 --> 00:40:53,894
MARISHA: Two, three-ish?

579
00:40:53,894 --> 00:40:55,335
ASHLEY: Two or three.

580
00:40:55,335 --> 00:41:06,076
MATT: "That's my Pike! Then this is nothing! The
dragonslayer, Pike Trickfoot,

581
00:41:06,076 --> 00:41:07,847
"come again to kill another!"

582
00:41:07,847 --> 00:41:08,955
TRAVIS: That's how she's known.

583
00:41:08,955 --> 00:41:10,926
MATT: "Great. Wondrous."

584
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:11,978
TRAVIS: Ruthless.

585
00:41:11,978 --> 00:41:13,620
MATT: "Let me know when it's dead."

586
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,544
ALL: No, no no no.

587
00:41:15,544 --> 00:41:20,478
ASHLEY: It's okay right now.

588
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:26,835
TRAVIS: We're glad you're safe. We want to make
sure you're out of here before any real damage

589
00:41:26,835 --> 00:41:28,451
comes to town.

590
00:41:28,451 --> 00:41:33,760
MARISHA: We're also going to need any and all
recruits that you may know of, or any favors you

591
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:38,049
can call in. If we are in fact going to fight this
dragon?

592
00:41:38,049 --> 00:41:40,321
TRAVIS: We haven't quite talked about--

593
00:41:40,321 --> 00:41:42,375
LAURA: We really should have a conversation about
that.

594
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:44,979
TRAVIS: But what is known is that there's going to
be a fight tomorrow.

595
00:41:44,979 --> 00:41:46,996
TALIESIN: There's probably going to be a fight
tomorrow.

596
00:41:46,996 --> 00:41:51,360
TRAVIS: And unless you want to throw down, and I
know you're a mighty warrior, not saying you

597
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:56,251
shouldn't, but if you don't want to, now might be
the time to hop-skip out of here.

598
00:41:56,251 --> 00:41:58,103
TALIESIN: There's no shame in prudence.

599
00:41:58,103 --> 00:42:00,926
TRAVIS: No, no, not in the hole!

600
00:42:00,926 --> 00:42:06,866
MATT: He swats your hand away and goes, "Heh."
Goes back down into the hole, you can hear him

601
00:42:06,866 --> 00:42:12,141
rummaging a little bit, something falls and
shatters. (incoherent grumbling) Eventually he

602
00:42:12,141 --> 00:42:19,978
comes back out clutching a dark brown glass bottle
with a cork in it, and he goes, "I'm going to need

603
00:42:19,978 --> 00:42:23,548
"some of this. Ugh."

604
00:42:23,548 --> 00:42:25,468
TRAVIS: Well, don't be stingy.

605
00:42:25,468 --> 00:42:29,655
MATT: "This is the Trickfoot Special. Been
distilling while you were away."

606
00:42:29,655 --> 00:42:32,510
LIAM: How much you got of that, old man?

607
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:34,956
MATT: "Ah, about two casks."

608
00:42:34,956 --> 00:42:37,899
ASHLEY: All right. I drink the whole rest of the
bottle.

609
00:42:37,899 --> 00:42:44,770
MATT: It is awful. It is like potato moonshine in
its most basic form. It is--

610
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,388
LAURA: Pike's going to be so fucked up.

611
00:42:46,388 --> 00:42:55,109
MATT: You probably singed your eyebrows just
putting the bottle near your face, which you don't

612
00:42:55,109 --> 00:43:00,491
realize, halfway through the bottle as you drink it,
you pick up, oh, it burns. This burns.

613
00:43:00,491 --> 00:43:03,083
TRAVIS: Welcome to Ren Faire.

614
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:05,202
TALIESIN: Original recipe Windex. My favorite.

615
00:43:05,202 --> 00:43:07,333
ASHLEY: It's a little stronger than I remember
it.

616
00:43:07,333 --> 00:43:09,602
LIAM: Hey, Pike's at disadvantage for the rest of
the day.

617
00:43:09,602 --> 00:43:21,536
ASHLEY: Oh no. Would you all-- there's plenty
more, would you all like to join me and have a sip?

618
00:43:21,536 --> 00:43:23,769
SAM: I'm okay, I'm okay for now.

619
00:43:23,769 --> 00:43:25,303
TRAVIS: Yeah, hook it up, homie.

620
00:43:25,303 --> 00:43:27,873
TALIESIN: It's been a day. I will.

621
00:43:27,873 --> 00:43:32,603
MATT: "Let me get the cups." And he goes and opens
the cabinet and there's shattered glass. "Okay, no cups."

622
00:43:32,603 --> 00:43:34,617
MARISHA: It's fine.

623
00:43:34,617 --> 00:43:35,868
MATT: "Bottle it is."

624
00:43:35,868 --> 00:43:37,163
SAM: Pass the bottle.

625
00:43:37,163 --> 00:43:40,518
MATT: You guys pass the bottle around, finish off
the bottle, it's--

626
00:43:40,518 --> 00:43:41,848
LAURA: Finish the bottle?

627
00:43:41,848 --> 00:43:43,672
MATT: Well, she took most of it.

628
00:43:43,672 --> 00:43:52,523
ASHLEY: I think we should make a meal. He's a very
good cook.

629
00:43:52,523 --> 00:43:55,246
SAM: Is the kitchen even functional here?

630
00:43:55,246 --> 00:43:56,569
LIAM: Is there food?

631
00:43:56,569 --> 00:43:58,181
LAURA: You know what we should do?

632
00:43:58,181 --> 00:44:00,472
MARISHA: Eat food and talk about a plan?

633
00:44:00,472 --> 00:44:03,506
LAURA: Bring him into the mansion.

634
00:44:03,506 --> 00:44:05,112
TALIESIN: We could bring him into the mansion.

635
00:44:05,112 --> 00:44:06,635
SAM: We do need time to rest and plan.

636
00:44:06,635 --> 00:44:09,005
TALIESIN: We still have one more stop before the
evening's done.

637
00:44:09,005 --> 00:44:13,800
LAURA: You can show his people that work at the
mansion how to cook, 'cause they are terrible, I

638
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,293
can tell you that much.

639
00:44:15,293 --> 00:44:16,605
SAM: They're great at one dish.

640
00:44:16,605 --> 00:44:17,723
MATT: "You have a mansion?"

641
00:44:17,723 --> 00:44:21,603
SAM: I do! I'm quite successful as gnomes go, in
fact, before we--

642
00:44:21,603 --> 00:44:24,227
MATT: "Pike. He has a mansion."

643
00:44:24,227 --> 00:44:28,097
ASHLEY: He does. He does have a mansion. It's a
magic mansion.

644
00:44:28,097 --> 00:44:29,905
TRAVIS: Is Wilhand drunk right now?

645
00:44:29,905 --> 00:44:34,199
MATT: He looks like he's coping with the past
week's events.

646
00:44:34,199 --> 00:44:36,232
TRAVIS: Insight check his soberness.

647
00:44:36,232 --> 00:44:38,623
LAURA: He's been drunk the whole time.

648
00:44:38,623 --> 00:44:44,564
SAM: Should we make the mansion, get Wilhand a
room, and then go to our last destination of this

649
00:44:44,564 --> 00:44:47,182
night before we turn in?

650
00:44:47,182 --> 00:44:48,663
TRAVIS: Yeah, we could do that.

651
00:44:48,663 --> 00:44:54,364
LIAM: Yeah Grog, how long do you reckon we have
before your cousin wants to either talk or get busy?

652
00:44:54,364 --> 00:44:57,924
TRAVIS: I don't know.

653
00:44:57,924 --> 00:45:01,191
SAM: Are we supposed to meet up with him later
tonight?

654
00:45:01,191 --> 00:45:07,334
TRAVIS: He said, at dawn, we-- Wait, at dawn we
fight, or at dawn we plan?

655
00:45:07,334 --> 00:45:13,331
MARISHA: I don't think I've ever heard anyone say "at
dawn, we plan." So I'm going to assume--

656
00:45:13,331 --> 00:45:14,672
ASHLEY: At dawn, we plan!

657
00:45:14,672 --> 00:45:16,687
SAM: At dawn, we rise and make a plan!

658
00:45:16,687 --> 00:45:17,928
TALIESIN: At dawn, we quorum!

659
00:45:17,928 --> 00:45:20,745
MARISHA: At dawn, we Microsoft Excel!

660
00:45:20,745 --> 00:45:30,216
MATT: You get the sense he meant at dawn, to make
an aggressive action.

661
00:45:30,216 --> 00:45:32,408
TALIESIN: So we have two stops before the evening's
done then.

662
00:45:32,408 --> 00:45:36,068
LAURA: Wait, where are we going?

663
00:45:36,068 --> 00:45:37,862
SAM: There's a house we're supposed to plunder.

664
00:45:37,862 --> 00:45:39,866
TALIESIN: There's a house we're supposed to
plunder, and we should plunder it.

665
00:45:39,866 --> 00:45:41,224
TRAVIS: Aw, really, do we give a shit about it?

666
00:45:41,224 --> 00:45:42,153
TALIESIN: Yes, we do.

667
00:45:42,153 --> 00:45:43,209
TRAVIS: No, you're right, we do.

668
00:45:43,209 --> 00:45:45,455
LAURA: Oh right, Master Quall.

669
00:45:45,455 --> 00:45:49,911
TALIESIN: Master Quall, and I will admit, I'm
vaguely indifferent about whether or not he gets

670
00:45:49,911 --> 00:45:55,775
his property back, but I am very keen to find out
what that property is, and what else he left if he

671
00:45:55,775 --> 00:45:57,042
left that.

672
00:45:57,042 --> 00:46:02,266
TRAVIS: Why don't we set up the mansion in
Wilhand's house, we'll go and run our errand, and

673
00:46:02,266 --> 00:46:05,367
we'll come back and he'll have gotten the kitchen
all up to spec.

674
00:46:05,367 --> 00:46:10,835
LIAM: Yeah, seeing as we might be tangling with a
black dragon tomorrow, an old one, I think maybe

675
00:46:10,835 --> 00:46:13,142
that stuff off you're talking about--

676
00:46:13,142 --> 00:46:14,369
TALIESIN: --god forbid.

677
00:46:14,369 --> 00:46:18,529
LIAM: No, I don't think it's a good idea, but if
it should happen-- if we get, I wanted to say

678
00:46:18,529 --> 00:46:24,917
railroaded into it, but I don't know what that is.
We'll probably need every bit of edge we can get,

679
00:46:24,917 --> 00:46:29,046
so I actually agree with you for the moment,
Percival, we should stop by this house.

680
00:46:29,046 --> 00:46:31,367
TALIESIN: This is terrifying and this is proof
that we should do it, then.

681
00:46:31,367 --> 00:46:42,616
MARISHA: Can we get an early, 12 Angry Men raise
of hands on who if they want to fight the dragon

682
00:46:42,616 --> 00:46:44,654
or not? Do we want to do this?

683
00:46:44,654 --> 00:46:47,437
TALIESIN: Who wants to fight the dragon tomorrow?

684
00:46:47,437 --> 00:46:58,010
SAM: Yeah, I'm down. We've got 40 goliaths with
us, this is the best time to attack. No? I'm alone here?

685
00:46:58,010 --> 00:47:01,311
LAURA: It's true, it's true, I mean, it could be
one of the best times to attack.

686
00:47:01,311 --> 00:47:05,811
TALIESIN: I would like to do three more days of
research and planning--

687
00:47:05,811 --> 00:47:08,355
TRAVIS: So can we make the door? Wilhand's
starting to turn green.

688
00:47:08,355 --> 00:47:10,702
LIAM: I mean, it's a big conversation that we
should have.

689
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:11,884
SAM: Let's table it.

690
00:47:11,884 --> 00:47:13,725
LIAM: The where-when-how is pretty huge.

691
00:47:13,725 --> 00:47:16,702
TRAVIS: Wilhand, just give me the bottle, take it
easy.

692
00:47:16,702 --> 00:47:19,198
TALIESIN: I feel that that's not something we do
spur of the moment.

693
00:47:19,198 --> 00:47:24,515
SAM: All right. Let's get this man to safety and
then we'll finish up our errands for the day, yes?

694
00:47:24,515 --> 00:47:26,531
LAURA: Is there anything you want to bring with
you?

695
00:47:26,531 --> 00:47:43,296
MATT: "Uh--" He starts walking over to the shrine,
and he takes it off with his hand. "That's all I

696
00:47:43,296 --> 00:47:46,170
"need." As the head rolls off.

697
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:51,246
TRAVIS: Never saw anything.

698
00:47:51,246 --> 00:47:52,533
ASHLEY: We'll fix it.

699
00:47:52,533 --> 00:47:59,651
MATT: "It's fine. They took ol' Davin, too."

700
00:47:59,651 --> 00:48:01,596
SAM: What, who?

701
00:48:01,596 --> 00:48:04,197
MATT: Davin was your neighbor.

702
00:48:04,197 --> 00:48:06,805
ASHLEY: Davin was my neighbor.

703
00:48:06,805 --> 00:48:09,160
SAM: Is he gone, is he dead?

704
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,648
MARISHA: Didn't we meet Davin?

705
00:48:10,648 --> 00:48:12,340
MATT: You didn't meet Davin, no.

706
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:25,393
MATT: "They dragged a bunch to the iron stocks. I
could only hide. Your uncle's a coward, Pike. I'm

707
00:48:25,393 --> 00:48:31,665
"sorry. I should've helped." You get the sense now
the alcohol's kicked in and he's started to go

708
00:48:31,665 --> 00:48:33,837
through his emotional process now.

709
00:48:33,837 --> 00:48:36,839
LAURA: He's your uncle? I thought he was your
grandfather.

710
00:48:36,839 --> 00:48:39,148
ASHLEY: He's my great-grandfather.

711
00:48:39,148 --> 00:48:40,318
SAM: And uncle?

712
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:41,357
LIAM: He's drunk.

713
00:48:41,357 --> 00:48:42,381
MATT: Very drunk.

714
00:48:42,381 --> 00:48:46,948
TALIESIN: Come on, no more of that talk.

715
00:48:46,948 --> 00:48:51,900
LIAM: Grandfather. Let me carry that for you,
before you drop it. I'll keep it safe. I'll keep

716
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:56,099
it safe for you. You don't want the head to fall
off it.

717
00:48:56,099 --> 00:49:01,245
MATT: "No, its head's fine. Okay." Passes it
over.

718
00:49:01,245 --> 00:49:03,617
LIAM: I subtly pick up the head from the ground.

719
00:49:03,617 --> 00:49:09,395
ASHLEY: So we can put him in the mansion?

720
00:49:09,395 --> 00:49:10,911
SAM: All right, yes, I'll make the mansion.

721
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:16,597
ASHLEY: All right. I kiss him on his forehead and
say: it's going to be okay. Go in there, take a

722
00:49:16,597 --> 00:49:18,595
nap, and show them how to cook.

723
00:49:18,595 --> 00:49:24,075
MATT: "I will. You come back soon, my dumpling."
And he squeezes your cheek a little bit.

724
00:49:24,075 --> 00:49:27,683
(whispers) "He has a mansion."

725
00:49:27,683 --> 00:49:28,911
ASHLEY: (whispers) What?

726
00:49:28,911 --> 00:49:30,349
MATT: (whispers) "A mansion!"

727
00:49:30,349 --> 00:49:32,546
LAURA: (whispers) And he's super interested in
her.

728
00:49:32,546 --> 00:49:35,463
MATT: "You're of marrying age, young Pike."

729
00:49:35,463 --> 00:49:38,262
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

730
00:49:38,262 --> 00:49:42,748
ASHLEY: We'll talk about it later.

731
00:49:42,748 --> 00:49:44,311
MATT: "I'll tell you how it is."

732
00:49:44,311 --> 00:49:45,323
ASHLEY: What?

733
00:49:45,323 --> 00:49:47,048
MATT: "Mansion. I'll tell you how it is."

734
00:49:47,048 --> 00:49:49,359
ASHLEY: Oh, I've been there! You can go stay--

735
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:50,928
MATT: "You've been to his mansion?"

736
00:49:50,928 --> 00:49:55,030
ASHLEY: I have my own room. You can go stay in my
room.

737
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:57,204
MATT: "I don't know if I want to--"

738
00:49:57,204 --> 00:49:58,875
ASHLEY: Hey Scanlan, how will he know which room
is my room?

739
00:49:58,875 --> 00:50:00,968
SAM: Your room is the one covered in rose petals.

740
00:50:00,968 --> 00:50:06,654
MATT: "Show me the mansion."

741
00:50:06,654 --> 00:50:17,866
SAM: So I will cast the spell, I'll sit down and
start humming. (singing) My house is a very, very,

742
00:50:17,866 --> 00:50:23,823
very fine house. With chickens everywhere. It used
to be so fair--

743
00:50:23,823 --> 00:50:31,065
MATT: As the shimmering doorway is conjured in the
center of the room.

744
00:50:31,065 --> 00:50:33,395
SAM: I take him in, I show him to his room.

745
00:50:33,395 --> 00:50:40,700
MATT: The door opens and he looks inside. "Whoa."
Turns around to you, looking at you through the

746
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:42,947
doorway. "It's big."

747
00:50:42,947 --> 00:50:44,458
ASHLEY: It's very big.

748
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:50,773
SAM: Here, come with me. I take him upstairs, take
him to his room. And before I bid him adieu I say:

749
00:50:50,773 --> 00:50:56,790
later tonight we can discuss more, but I would
like to ask for your granddaughter's hand in

750
00:50:56,790 --> 00:51:01,415
marriage. But I'll need your permission first.

751
00:51:01,415 --> 00:51:10,926
MATT: I need you to roll a hell of a persuasion
check on this one.

752
00:51:10,926 --> 00:51:12,400
LIAM: Roll for initiative, Sam.

753
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,223
ASHLEY: Roll for initiative.

754
00:51:14,223 --> 00:51:16,191
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

755
00:51:16,191 --> 00:51:22,176
SAM: Well, it's a 20.

756
00:51:22,176 --> 00:51:23,535
MARISHA: Shut up!

757
00:51:23,535 --> 00:51:24,873
SAM: But that's low for me.

758
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:26,250
TALIESIN: No, it is.

759
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:34,107
MATT: He goes: "I'll think about it. I'd like to
see more of your fine abode."

760
00:51:34,107 --> 00:51:41,601
SAM: I call for five servants, and I instruct them
to take him wherever he'd like to go and give him

761
00:51:41,601 --> 00:51:42,943
whatever he needs.

762
00:51:42,943 --> 00:51:45,187
LIAM: (Wilhand voice) "Wine cellar!"

763
00:51:45,187 --> 00:51:47,848
MATT: They begin taking him on a tour of the grand
estate.

764
00:51:47,848 --> 00:51:49,449
SAM: Don't be cheap with the chicken!

765
00:51:49,449 --> 00:51:56,683
All right, so I scoot out back to rejoin our
friends.

766
00:51:56,683 --> 00:51:57,629
MATT: Okay.

767
00:51:57,629 --> 00:51:59,664
TALIESIN: I assume at some point we're taking a
short rest, by the way.

768
00:51:59,664 --> 00:52:02,741
MATT: You guys took a short rest the end of the
last session.

769
00:52:02,741 --> 00:52:03,978
TALIESIN: Oh lordy, thank you.

770
00:52:03,978 --> 00:52:07,703
MATT: So if you wanted to use any hit dice to heal
yourself at that time.

771
00:52:07,703 --> 00:52:14,034
ASHLEY: I would like to go check my room out and
see how it is. See if it's okay, any damage.

772
00:52:14,034 --> 00:52:22,355
MATT: Your room is intact. It's a little dirty and
some of the crumbled stone and roof part pushed

773
00:52:22,355 --> 00:52:27,002
its way into the room across the floor, but for
the most part your room is intact. Wilhand's room,

774
00:52:27,002 --> 00:52:30,930
which was the main room on the upper floor, was
the one that got destroyed by the fallen rubble.

775
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:34,527
ASHLEY: Right.

776
00:52:34,527 --> 00:52:37,432
MATT: All right. What's the plan?

777
00:52:37,432 --> 00:52:44,573
SAM: Should we split the party and send a few
people to pillage this house that we were

778
00:52:44,573 --> 00:52:45,951
instructed to pillage?

779
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:47,654
TALIESIN: We can all do it. Let's do it together.

780
00:52:47,654 --> 00:52:50,022
MARISHA: Yes, I feel like this would be a group
outing.

781
00:52:50,022 --> 00:52:56,018
ASHLEY: I wanted to grab something under the bed.
I'm going to take it and I'm going to hide it.

782
00:52:56,018 --> 00:52:57,563
MATT: Okay.

783
00:52:57,563 --> 00:53:03,170
SAM: But there was some talk of needing someone to
take us through the sewers, and I can go fetch

784
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:05,002
someone who knows the sewers.

785
00:53:05,002 --> 00:53:09,077
LIAM: I think we need to maybe have a talk about
what we're doing.

786
00:53:09,077 --> 00:53:10,600
TALIESIN: Talk before that happens.

787
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:14,311
LIAM: Before finding your friend.

788
00:53:14,311 --> 00:53:15,900
MARISHA: Time is of the essence.

789
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:18,981
LIAM: You're talking about Mr. D, I know, yeah.

790
00:53:18,981 --> 00:53:21,359
SAM: Well, or someone with him, yes.

791
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:24,600
LIAM: Right. It's a good idea, but I think we need
to figure out what we're doing first.

792
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,958
SAM: Sure. What are we doing?

793
00:53:26,958 --> 00:53:28,907
LIAM: I have no fucking clue.

794
00:53:28,907 --> 00:53:30,467
MARISHA: What are we doing, actually?

795
00:53:30,467 --> 00:53:32,011
TALIESIN: First, we're robbing an old man.

796
00:53:32,011 --> 00:53:34,004
TRAVIS: Can we walk and talk?

797
00:53:34,004 --> 00:53:35,829
LAURA: Yeah, we walk and talk.

798
00:53:35,829 --> 00:53:38,240
SAM: Where's Master Quall's--

799
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:41,102
LAURA: It's at the fountain crossroads--

800
00:53:41,102 --> 00:53:43,046
SAM: --brick two-story house near the fountain?

801
00:53:43,046 --> 00:53:47,004
MARISHA: Before we walk and talk, do we get the
general idea that it's safe to walk through the

802
00:53:47,004 --> 00:53:53,925
city right now without being murdered? Considering
we just put on the most epic Avengers-style display.

803
00:53:53,925 --> 00:53:57,346
MATT: Right, and some people are coming to the
streets, though moving quickly from destination to

804
00:53:57,346 --> 00:54:04,024
destination. Word has gotten around and there's
been a general sense of release throughout the

805
00:54:04,024 --> 00:54:11,884
city. You do pass a few of the Herd members, some
of which are gathering their supplies, gathering

806
00:54:11,884 --> 00:54:16,124
their arms, some of them are dragging the bodies
of friends that had died in previous frays or just

807
00:54:16,124 --> 00:54:23,325
haven't been tended to. And all of them keep a
very intense eye on you. Nothing aggressive, but

808
00:54:23,325 --> 00:54:25,842
not friendly either.

809
00:54:25,842 --> 00:54:31,838
TALIESIN: I think we have to convince Kevdak to
abandon this plan to attack the dragon--

810
00:54:31,838 --> 00:54:33,618
LIAM: He's dead, he's not going to do it.

811
00:54:33,618 --> 00:54:37,030
TALIESIN: Oh, no, Kevdak, wrong one, I'm sorry.
You all look vaguely the same to me, I'm sorry.

812
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:39,639
LAURA: Percival!

813
00:54:39,639 --> 00:54:40,799
LIAM: Except for this one.

814
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:44,500
TALIESIN: No, he's got the beard. And the ability
to kill me in my sleep.

815
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,669
TRAVIS: I'm a unique little snowflake, I take no
offense.

816
00:54:46,669 --> 00:54:48,924
TALIESIN: I find you charming.

817
00:54:48,924 --> 00:54:50,012
TRAVIS: Thank you.

818
00:54:50,012 --> 00:54:53,924
TALIESIN: But no, we have to convince them not to
do this tomorrow.

819
00:54:53,924 --> 00:54:55,145
TRAVIS: Really?

820
00:54:55,145 --> 00:55:00,117
LAURA: Well, honestly, isn't the dragon going to
come pick up its loot in the next couple days?

821
00:55:00,117 --> 00:55:01,653
It's happening tomorrow?

822
00:55:01,653 --> 00:55:08,292
TALIESIN: I think that perhaps if it's possible to
convince them to at least wait one more cycle to

823
00:55:08,292 --> 00:55:09,908
heal and prepare for the battle--

824
00:55:09,908 --> 00:55:16,237
TRAVIS: I don't know if we'll be alive in the
morning. I don't know if it's occurred to any of

825
00:55:16,237 --> 00:55:22,985
you, but I don't particularly feel safe. I'm glad
we got out of there--

826
00:55:22,985 --> 00:55:24,695
LAURA: I'm glad we have a mansion to hide in.

827
00:55:24,695 --> 00:55:30,044
TRAVIS: I'm glad we have a mansion, I'm glad we
have a Vestige because of it, but look, I got

828
00:55:30,044 --> 00:55:34,424
abandoned once. Think anything's changed since
then?

829
00:55:34,424 --> 00:55:39,773
LAURA: They're not good people. They killed a lot
of innocents.

830
00:55:39,773 --> 00:55:42,513
TALIESIN: I genuinely don't understand the place
you come from.

831
00:55:42,513 --> 00:55:47,110
TRAVIS: No, neither do I. But I don't really
understand much things.

832
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:51,728
TALIESIN: I feel much better about any decision to
just leave then, although we would have to do

833
00:55:51,728 --> 00:55:53,746
something about the city and everyone who's in
it.

834
00:55:53,746 --> 00:55:57,856
LIAM: Yeah, there's a lot to think about, there
are a lot of people still here, and I personally

835
00:55:57,856 --> 00:56:04,023
don't think attacking that dragon in the next few
days is a wise decision. But if we do leave, what

836
00:56:04,023 --> 00:56:08,337
do we do with these people? They're going to be
run over by these people.

837
00:56:08,337 --> 00:56:15,975
LAURA: It's possible we can wait for all of the
goliaths and other barbarians to attack the

838
00:56:15,975 --> 00:56:22,197
dragon, and when they all leave the city, we bar
them out, take the city back.

839
00:56:22,197 --> 00:56:25,274
SAM: And hold it against a dragon?

840
00:56:25,274 --> 00:56:31,231
LAURA: Well. The dragon could be content fighting
them. We take the time and get everyone else out

841
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:32,660
of the city.

842
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:37,980
TALIESIN: Are they clever enough to attack the
dragon at the point at which the drop is made, or

843
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:43,370
are they going to not make the drop and wait for
the dragon to attack the city?

844
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:47,097
TRAVIS: Look, if it was the day before yesterday I
would have said they're all fools and they're

845
00:56:47,097 --> 00:56:52,694
going to do it the stupid way, but I think I
underestimated 'em a bit, so yeah. I think they

846
00:56:52,694 --> 00:56:54,238
might be a bit clever.

847
00:56:54,238 --> 00:56:59,360
MARISHA: We also have your cousin Zanror now at
the head, which seems a little bit more clever

848
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,808
than Kevdak ever was.

849
00:57:00,808 --> 00:57:02,063
TRAVIS: Yeah.

850
00:57:02,063 --> 00:57:07,072
TALIESIN: We also have to empty out the prisons if
we get that chance of any of the citizens they may

851
00:57:07,072 --> 00:57:08,428
be holding.

852
00:57:08,428 --> 00:57:15,045
MARISHA: Well, look, it's not a bad call, the
dragons seem to be interested in the power that

853
00:57:15,045 --> 00:57:19,789
they hold over the people. There's no people, no
power.

854
00:57:19,789 --> 00:57:23,420
TALIESIN: Will your cousin understand that we have
a bigger battle to fight?

855
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:25,632
TRAVIS: No.

856
00:57:25,632 --> 00:57:27,914
LAURA: On the other hand--

857
00:57:27,914 --> 00:57:30,510
SAM: This is our battle, we're trying to kill
these dragons!

858
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:33,989
LAURA: --when are we going to have a better
opportunity to kill a fucking dragon than with 40

859
00:57:33,989 --> 00:57:37,043
giant strapping--

860
00:57:37,043 --> 00:57:41,486
SAM: Two Vestiges, an army of 40 barbarians.

861
00:57:41,486 --> 00:57:44,123
LIAM: Are we going to have this discussion right
here, in the street?

862
00:57:44,123 --> 00:57:46,459
TALIESIN: Well, we're walking while we're having
it.

863
00:57:46,459 --> 00:57:52,650
LIAM: How are we going to deal with one of the
largest dragons we've ever seen in the air? What

864
00:57:52,650 --> 00:57:58,271
are 40 goliaths going to do with something 500
feet above us, spitting bile from above?

865
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:00,500
MARISHA: He has to land to get his treasure.

866
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:03,327
SAM: We're going to have to make that plan at some
point.

867
00:58:03,327 --> 00:58:06,196
TALIESIN: If I had time, if I had a few days--

868
00:58:06,196 --> 00:58:08,091
LIAM: You've got a day and a half, maximum.

869
00:58:08,091 --> 00:58:12,225
MARISHA: If we had a little bit of time or if
we're really, really smart, we could theoretically

870
00:58:12,225 --> 00:58:16,450
rig the most epic dragon trap ever.

871
00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:18,048
TALIESIN: We could.

872
00:58:18,048 --> 00:58:23,903
LIAM: Do you think your cousin would hold for a
couple more days? Could he see the sense of

873
00:58:23,903 --> 00:58:25,294
planning that longer?

874
00:58:25,294 --> 00:58:28,238
LAURA: We can't leave the people in this city
under the rule of any more of these monsters.

875
00:58:28,238 --> 00:58:30,503
TALIESIN: Which is why we should get them to
flee.

876
00:58:30,503 --> 00:58:32,435
LAURA: We have to get people out.

877
00:58:32,435 --> 00:58:39,699
MARISHA: Right, because even if we somehow by some
insane chance defeat the dragon, cool, we've

878
00:58:39,699 --> 00:58:43,624
defeated the dragon and now the city is still
under control by the Herd.

879
00:58:43,624 --> 00:58:46,029
TALIESIN: Well, the Herd will leave, I think.

880
00:58:46,029 --> 00:58:49,139
LAURA: Will they? After they ransack everything
again?

881
00:58:49,139 --> 00:58:51,040
LIAM: Well, that's what Grog pitched to them.

882
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:55,735
TRAVIS: Here's my vote, so I can have it said. I
would rather get everyone that doesn't want to die

883
00:58:55,735 --> 00:59:02,179
in this town out to that encampment. If we take
this meeting with Zanror, we will no longer be

884
00:59:02,179 --> 00:59:09,858
able to walk away. There could be a total chance
that they all turn on us right then. In the throne

885
00:59:09,858 --> 00:59:16,179
room, in the yard, wherever we are. We could leave
now.

886
00:59:16,179 --> 00:59:19,783
LAURA: How do we get everyone out?

887
00:59:19,783 --> 00:59:23,046
MARISHA: You and Zanror seemed to have a mutual
respect.

888
00:59:23,046 --> 00:59:28,790
TRAVIS: Yeah, because I just saved his life. For a
second. I also beat his ass when he was little,

889
00:59:28,790 --> 00:59:32,698
and let me tell you a thing about grudges: they
don't go away.

890
00:59:32,698 --> 00:59:36,503
MARISHA: So you don't think he would hesitate in a
second to turn on us?

891
00:59:36,503 --> 00:59:41,860
TRAVIS: No, he's a little man, and little men have
Napoleon complexes. He's this horrible elf from

892
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:42,866
the West.

893
00:59:42,866 --> 00:59:44,566
SAM: I do have a Napoleon complex.

894
00:59:44,566 --> 00:59:46,220
TALIESIN: I've seen it, it's huge.

895
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:55,106
ASHLEY: But if everybody is out of the town, and
it's empty, then won't the dragon know?

896
00:59:55,106 --> 00:59:57,215
TALIESIN: Yes. It'll be furious.

897
00:59:57,215 --> 00:59:58,792
ASHLEY: And then won't he leave?

898
00:59:58,792 --> 01:00:00,534
LAURA: And he'll come find us.

899
01:00:00,534 --> 01:00:07,176
LIAM: Anything we do here, anything we do to that
dragon, anything we do in the city is likely to be

900
01:00:07,176 --> 01:00:09,855
known by the other wyrms.

901
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:11,131
MARISHA: Sure.

902
01:00:11,131 --> 01:00:12,464
TALIESIN: Eventually, yes.

903
01:00:12,464 --> 01:00:16,782
LIAM: So if we kill that dragon, what do the other
dragons do in that moment, and are we ready to

904
01:00:16,782 --> 01:00:18,283
take on Thordak right now?

905
01:00:18,283 --> 01:00:20,183
SAM: No! We kill it and run.

906
01:00:20,183 --> 01:00:24,088
LAURA: But we can't kill all of them at the same
time. It's got to be a one-by-one process.

907
01:00:24,088 --> 01:00:29,205
LIAM: Absolutely, but are we going to try to kill
the black and then go on a hunt for all these--

908
01:00:29,205 --> 01:00:32,592
MARISHA: There are going to be consequences to
this no matter what.

909
01:00:32,592 --> 01:00:34,293
TALIESIN: How big is the black dragon?

910
01:00:34,293 --> 01:00:39,446
MATT: From what you saw? Oh man.

911
01:00:39,446 --> 01:00:43,310
TRAVIS: Bigger than the blue, bigger than the
white?

912
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:46,492
MATT: It was bigger than the blue, about equal
size to the white.

913
01:00:46,492 --> 01:00:49,236
LAURA: The white one that we killed, or the white
one that we also saw?

914
01:00:49,236 --> 01:00:52,557
MATT: The one that you fought at the Keep--

915
01:00:52,557 --> 01:00:54,541
LAURA: Yeah, that one was real bad.

916
01:00:54,541 --> 01:00:56,453
TRAVIS: Where I rolled a 21 and it missed.

917
01:00:56,453 --> 01:01:09,785
MATT: Yeah, it was, I'd say from height size of
standing on its legs, probably, I dunno, 30 to 40

918
01:01:09,785 --> 01:01:11,556
feet tall?

919
01:01:11,556 --> 01:01:17,144
MARISHA: We've never fought like a full realized
dragon, correct?

920
01:01:17,144 --> 01:01:18,719
MATT: You've fought them.

921
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:21,485
LIAM: We've run from them.

922
01:01:21,485 --> 01:01:27,036
TRAVIS: Yeah, remember 21 missed. I can't believe
I'm saying this--

923
01:01:27,036 --> 01:01:31,738
LAURA: Yeah, but all those guys, they were, I
mean. They had strong attacks.

924
01:01:31,738 --> 01:01:36,444
TRAVIS: Right, but there might be some that can
hit him when he's in the air, but not all of them.

925
01:01:36,444 --> 01:01:42,250
TALIESIN: If I-- if I had time I could build a
machine that might be able to trap him on the

926
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:44,316
ground for at least a little while.

927
01:01:44,316 --> 01:01:49,142
TRAVIS: Yeah, if you had time. Why are we being in
such a rush about this?

928
01:01:49,142 --> 01:01:54,800
SAM: Because we know where the dragon is, we have
an army, we have an opportunity, this is it. We're

929
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,398
never going to have an army.

930
01:01:56,398 --> 01:02:00,779
TALIESIN: I think-- I disagree with that, I think
we'll absolutely have opportunities to have an

931
01:02:00,779 --> 01:02:07,434
army. And I think that if we call upon the Herd
later for something like this, maybe we can get

932
01:02:07,434 --> 01:02:09,991
them-- I don't know.

933
01:02:09,991 --> 01:02:11,867
ASHLEY: How much time are you thinking?

934
01:02:11,867 --> 01:02:13,978
TALIESIN: As much time as it takes.

935
01:02:13,978 --> 01:02:17,179
MARISHA: You can't build a machine like that in
under, what, a few weeks?

936
01:02:17,179 --> 01:02:21,631
SAM: And what if the machine fails? We need a plan
that doesn't rely on technology, I'm sorry.

937
01:02:21,631 --> 01:02:26,839
LAURA: What if we put out the loot, let him come
down and get it, and then we throw big ropes up

938
01:02:26,839 --> 01:02:28,517
and over him or something?

939
01:02:28,517 --> 01:02:34,041
MARISHA: I feel like between Pike and Scanlan and
I-- Well, look, I feel like between Pike, Scanlan,

940
01:02:34,041 --> 01:02:39,652
and I and Percy with his mechanical genius, we can
figure something amongst the spells that we know

941
01:02:39,652 --> 01:02:42,060
to make a viable trap.

942
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:46,422
SAM: If we have 40 goliaths throw 40 chains
attached to--

943
01:02:46,422 --> 01:02:47,966
TRAVIS: They're not all goliaths.

944
01:02:47,966 --> 01:02:55,737
SAM: Fine. 30 goliaths would throw 30 chains with
30 spikes on them at this dragon, I bet a few would hit.

945
01:02:55,737 --> 01:02:59,423
ASHLEY: I could throw up a Blade Barrier on top of
him.

946
01:02:59,423 --> 01:03:04,124
SAM: Yes, we are super powerful. They're strong,
we're smart, let's do this.

947
01:03:04,124 --> 01:03:10,474
LIAM: If we kill it now, we're going to have to
be-- if we kill it now, all the others are going

948
01:03:10,474 --> 01:03:15,919
to punish the people they're sitting upon, and
we're not ready to go dragon to dragon to dragon

949
01:03:15,919 --> 01:03:17,026
like that.

950
01:03:17,026 --> 01:03:21,169
LAURA: Will they? Dragons are vain, how do you
know they won't just find that dragon weak and

951
01:03:21,169 --> 01:03:23,268
think that he's not worthy of them--

952
01:03:23,268 --> 01:03:26,525
LIAM: They're going to know that something
challenged his power and there are going to be

953
01:03:26,525 --> 01:03:30,200
consequences for it, they'll make a display of
their strength.

954
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:34,031
MARISHA: I have a feeling they were very upset
when we killed the blue one.

955
01:03:34,031 --> 01:03:36,952
SAM: So what, we're never going to kill any of the
dragons, then? Because that will happen at some point.

956
01:03:36,952 --> 01:03:38,873
LIAM: We will. We will. It's--

957
01:03:38,873 --> 01:03:44,783
SAM: And they won't react then? It's-- this is our
mission, to kill these dragons.

958
01:03:44,783 --> 01:03:48,173
MARISHA: Once again, there's going to be
consequences no matter what we do.

959
01:03:48,173 --> 01:03:54,074
MATT: At this point, you guys have, as you hit the
end of your sentence, Percy, you all look up and

960
01:03:54,074 --> 01:03:59,683
you all see the two-story building with a dark red
brick contrasting against Wilhand's home, it's a

961
01:03:59,683 --> 01:04:08,878
deep-set heavy brick with dark wood siding to it,
and it looks like dark marble finishes certain

962
01:04:08,878 --> 01:04:12,571
elements of the base of it, it matches the
description that was given to you by Quall.

963
01:04:12,571 --> 01:04:14,460
LAURA: Does it look like it's been ransacked at
all?

964
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:18,220
MATT: It looks like the door is partially ajar.

965
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:19,964
MARISHA: Partially ajar?

966
01:04:19,964 --> 01:04:23,566
TALIESIN: Why don't we see how our favor holds?
Let's take a moment.

967
01:04:23,566 --> 01:04:27,148
SAM: All right. If we find something cool, we kill
the dragon.

968
01:04:27,148 --> 01:04:31,042
MARISHA: Oh, we're leaving this up to a coin flip,
now?

969
01:04:31,042 --> 01:04:34,415
TRAVIS: 20 or a one, seems to work well for us.

970
01:04:34,415 --> 01:04:35,907
MARISHA: Yeah.

971
01:04:35,907 --> 01:04:38,700
TALIESIN: I'm curious what the fates would say.

972
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:43,424
MARISHA: (sighs) I don't give a shit what the
fates have to say.

973
01:04:43,424 --> 01:04:46,085
LAURA: I do have a coin with a 20 and a one on
it.

974
01:04:46,085 --> 01:04:51,016
MATT: All right. So what's the plan?

975
01:04:51,016 --> 01:04:57,619
LAURA: Are we going-- Silently, quietly walking up
to the front door?

976
01:04:57,619 --> 01:05:00,324
TALIESIN: Vax, if you would be so kind?

977
01:05:00,324 --> 01:05:01,736
LAURA: It's already partially ajar.

978
01:05:01,736 --> 01:05:03,535
ASHLEY: Should we check it for traps first?

979
01:05:03,535 --> 01:05:04,686
TALIESIN: Check for traps.

980
01:05:04,686 --> 01:05:06,739
MATT: All right, if you want to make an
investigation check.

981
01:05:06,739 --> 01:05:14,117
LIAM: Investigation, or is it-- perception is
normally what I've done for traps, isn't it?

982
01:05:14,117 --> 01:05:17,323
MATT: Investigation's for traps, perception is to
notice how to disarm it.

983
01:05:17,323 --> 01:05:20,597
LIAM: All right. 27.

984
01:05:20,597 --> 01:05:26,357
MATT: 27. You approach the front door, doesn't
appear to be trapped, you open partly the door and

985
01:05:26,357 --> 01:05:32,546
the interior, fireplace is still going, and you
see the crackle in the distance, fine furniture

986
01:05:32,546 --> 01:05:38,415
set up. There is the body of a goliath face-down
on the ground about five feet from the front door,

987
01:05:38,415 --> 01:05:41,868
head splattered across the ground.

988
01:05:41,868 --> 01:05:43,326
LIAM: Oh, he's dead.

989
01:05:43,326 --> 01:05:50,011
MATT: You also look around the circumstances, and
you glance upward to where his head would be, and

990
01:05:50,011 --> 01:05:54,825
amongst all these stone tiles in the ceiling,
there's one that's set slightly lower than the

991
01:05:54,825 --> 01:05:56,870
rest, right above where that splatter occurred.

992
01:05:56,870 --> 01:06:00,972
ALL: (whispers) Traps!

993
01:06:00,972 --> 01:06:03,129
TRAVIS: A warm fire! And I run-- no.

994
01:06:03,129 --> 01:06:06,169
(laughter)

995
01:06:06,169 --> 01:06:08,966
LIAM: (Grog voice) It's a little brave, running
around.

996
01:06:08,966 --> 01:06:11,680
TALIESIN: Well, this is exactly what I was hoping
for.

997
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:16,984
LIAM: I need a minute, everybody. Everybody hang
back, just for a second.

998
01:06:16,984 --> 01:06:18,621
TRAVIS: Yeah, do you want me to hang outside?

999
01:06:18,621 --> 01:06:20,563
LIAM: Yeah, Vex'ahlia, could you come here?

1000
01:06:20,563 --> 01:06:22,023
LAURA: Of course, brother.

1001
01:06:22,023 --> 01:06:27,756
LIAM: Yeah. This is a death box, this room is a
death box. And I have a keen eye, but I wouldn't

1002
01:06:27,756 --> 01:06:29,616
mind another set.

1003
01:06:29,616 --> 01:06:31,130
LAURA: D'you want me to look around?

1004
01:06:31,130 --> 01:06:32,645
LIAM: I'd like us both to look around.

1005
01:06:32,645 --> 01:06:33,777
LAURA: From out here?

1006
01:06:33,777 --> 01:06:35,167
LIAM: No, I said come inside.

1007
01:06:35,167 --> 01:06:36,320
LAURA: I can actually walk in?

1008
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,128
LIAM: Yeah.

1009
01:06:37,128 --> 01:06:41,671
LAURA: All right. I stand exactly in front of the
door and don't take any more steps.

1010
01:06:41,671 --> 01:06:46,215
LIAM: Come in. Aww, you're my bestie. All right,
I'm going to start looking around for traps.

1011
01:06:46,215 --> 01:06:47,779
LAURA: I look for traps visually.

1012
01:06:47,779 --> 01:06:51,463
MATT: Both of you guys make investigation checks
as you slowly move forward at a slow pace.

1013
01:06:51,463 --> 01:06:53,698
SAM: Can I assist you guys?

1014
01:06:53,698 --> 01:06:58,615
LIAM: Well, you know, your music does calm and
soothe me--

1015
01:06:58,615 --> 01:07:04,026
SAM: Not with music, I'll send an invisible guy in
there to start pressing on the floor and walls.

1016
01:07:04,026 --> 01:07:08,011
LAURA: Oh, well, give us just a moment. Yeah, but
that's a good idea. 24.

1017
01:07:08,011 --> 01:07:09,222
LIAM: 24.

1018
01:07:09,222 --> 01:07:12,637
MATT: Okay. The two of you guys scoot forward, and
you find there are four different pillars in the

1019
01:07:12,637 --> 01:07:21,426
ceiling that are arranged in a similar way. They
are triggered by a little bit of pressure, and you

1020
01:07:21,426 --> 01:07:25,549
see there's a rug that oversets it, you can see
the slight variations in the texture of the ground

1021
01:07:25,549 --> 01:07:29,802
where the actual trigger plates are. You get the
sensation that this house was going to be

1022
01:07:29,802 --> 01:07:34,415
ransacked, and then the troop that came in, one of
them went (crushing noise) and they went nooope

1023
01:07:34,415 --> 01:07:35,753
and backed out of the house.

1024
01:07:35,753 --> 01:07:37,347
(laughter)

1025
01:07:37,347 --> 01:07:42,829
MATT: You eventually find your way across this
area, marking quietly with an arrow or scraping

1026
01:07:42,829 --> 01:07:47,225
the carpet where each one of these places are, but
you make your way across the room to a staircase

1027
01:07:47,225 --> 01:07:48,932
that leads up, staircase that leads down.

1028
01:07:48,932 --> 01:07:58,056
LIAM: Bullshit, bullshit, lotta bullshit. All
right, guys, I think it's safe to come into the

1029
01:07:58,056 --> 01:08:04,275
first room. So you said, because I was being a
jackass and saying bullshit, what was the

1030
01:08:04,275 --> 01:08:05,826
description you just gave?

1031
01:08:05,826 --> 01:08:07,202
LAURA: There's stairs, we're at the bottom of the
stairs.

1032
01:08:07,202 --> 01:08:10,205
MATT: Yeah, there's the main living area that has
the fireplace, and then stairs that go up and

1033
01:08:10,205 --> 01:08:11,558
stairs that go down.

1034
01:08:11,558 --> 01:08:13,719
LAURA: Are there doors in this main-- it's like a
foyer?

1035
01:08:13,719 --> 01:08:17,130
MATT: It's like a giant foyer area, there's an
area that passes behind the stairs, something that

1036
01:08:17,130 --> 01:08:19,365
would go into a kitchen area, like a dining room
kitchen.

1037
01:08:19,365 --> 01:08:21,327
LIAM: Let's not split up, let's do this together.

1038
01:08:21,327 --> 01:08:25,433
TALIESIN: He's rich and paranoid, so if anything
is of value it'll be downstairs, so I say we do

1039
01:08:25,433 --> 01:08:26,633
upstairs first.

1040
01:08:26,633 --> 01:08:27,710
LAURA: All right.

1041
01:08:27,710 --> 01:08:29,932
MATT: Does Trinket wait outside, or is Trinket
following you?

1042
01:08:29,932 --> 01:08:38,730
LAURA: Ohh. Trinket, dear? Come on, come on, d'you
want to go in the locket? You do? If you don't,

1043
01:08:38,730 --> 01:08:41,868
you can wait out here but it's probably safer in
the locket.

1044
01:08:41,868 --> 01:08:44,361
MATT: (disgruntled bear noises) Lumbers forward,
gives you a look like--

1045
01:08:44,361 --> 01:08:47,427
LAURA: Don't be sad about it, if you don't want
to, I'm not going to make you.

1046
01:08:47,427 --> 01:08:52,251
MATT: Trinket's pulled into the amulet.

1047
01:08:52,251 --> 01:08:55,080
LAURA: Ooh, I love him so much.

1048
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:57,614
MATT: Amulet which you've now been in.

1049
01:08:57,614 --> 01:08:59,565
LAURA: What was it like, Grog?

1050
01:08:59,565 --> 01:09:05,818
TRAVIS: I left a little something in there for
him. Time doesn't pass, right? Does time pass in

1051
01:09:05,818 --> 01:09:06,973
the locket?

1052
01:09:06,973 --> 01:09:08,482
MATT: You don't know.

1053
01:09:08,482 --> 01:09:10,317
TRAVIS: Well, I farted right before I hopped out.

1054
01:09:10,317 --> 01:09:12,736
(laughter)

1055
01:09:12,736 --> 01:09:14,790
LIAM: Like a nintendo cartridge.

1056
01:09:14,790 --> 01:09:17,967
ASHLEY: (fart noise) Raaaah! Goosh.

1057
01:09:17,967 --> 01:09:20,566
TRAVIS: I might not live past this. (fart noise)

1058
01:09:20,566 --> 01:09:22,742
(laughter)

1059
01:09:22,742 --> 01:09:24,384
MATT: Got to leave your mark.

1060
01:09:24,384 --> 01:09:29,755
LAURA: Can we check out the stairs and make sure
nothing's wrong with the stairs?

1061
01:09:29,755 --> 01:09:31,947
MATT: Yeah. Go ahead and make an investigation
check.

1062
01:09:31,947 --> 01:09:34,921
LAURA: Oh, I did not see anything.

1063
01:09:34,921 --> 01:09:36,567
LIAM: I'm fine. I got a 20.

1064
01:09:36,567 --> 01:09:48,135
MATT: Okay. The stairs-- As you begin to inspect,
you reach out and take the railing and take the

1065
01:09:48,135 --> 01:09:50,767
first step and your foot passes through the
stair.

1066
01:09:50,767 --> 01:09:55,520
LIAM: Ooh, that's not solid. At all. Look, put
your foot through that.

1067
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,873
LAURA: I'm going to stand here and watch you do
it, actually.

1068
01:09:57,873 --> 01:10:04,134
LIAM: I'm going to get down on my knees and stick
my head through the stairs--

1069
01:10:04,134 --> 01:10:06,225
LAURA: Oh, what? Are you fucking kidding me right
now?

1070
01:10:06,225 --> 01:10:10,784
MATT: You go to try and stop him as he pushes his
head through the step.

1071
01:10:10,784 --> 01:10:12,101
LAURA: You're a moron!

1072
01:10:12,101 --> 01:10:13,369
LIAM: I know!

1073
01:10:13,369 --> 01:10:16,922
MATT: You pass through this illusory staircase,
and you look up and you can see the bottom half of

1074
01:10:16,922 --> 01:10:25,095
the staircase. This area is a slide that descends
into darkness. You having your darkvision can see

1075
01:10:25,095 --> 01:10:30,224
that the slide descends into a now-cold furnace.

1076
01:10:30,224 --> 01:10:34,560
LAURA: D'you want to get your whole body in
there?

1077
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:38,567
LIAM: But can I see-- I pull my head up, what can
I see at the top of the stairs, is there a landing?

1078
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:45,061
MATT: No, you look up and if you, from where the
illusion is the illusory stairs stop at a ceiling,

1079
01:10:45,061 --> 01:10:49,677
a stone ceiling that leads down, you can't look
past it, looking up you can see a landing and a

1080
01:10:49,677 --> 01:10:50,977
secondary floor.

1081
01:10:50,977 --> 01:10:54,049
LIAM: Okay. Is there any stray furniture around?

1082
01:10:54,049 --> 01:10:58,366
MATT: Yeah, there's precariously placed--

1083
01:10:58,366 --> 01:11:00,222
LIAM: Are there any shitty pillows or anything?

1084
01:11:00,222 --> 01:11:02,472
MATT: Yeah, there's like a couple throw pillows on
the couch that are by the--

1085
01:11:02,472 --> 01:11:03,879
LAURA: What are shitty pillows?

1086
01:11:03,879 --> 01:11:09,364
LIAM: I totally ignore my sister, which is what
I've done half my entire life, and I stick my head

1087
01:11:09,364 --> 01:11:11,308
down and I let it go and watch it go down the
slide.

1088
01:11:11,308 --> 01:11:14,870
LAURA: Was that fun? Was that fu--

1089
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:19,744
MATT: (roar-of-fire sound) You guys watch as a jet
of flame jettisons out from the staircase.

1090
01:11:19,744 --> 01:11:21,340
(laughter)

1091
01:11:21,340 --> 01:11:27,577
MATT: Singes the top of the roof area, where
there's a bunch of wood, but the wood is not

1092
01:11:27,577 --> 01:11:30,042
burned or charred and the flames die down again.

1093
01:11:30,042 --> 01:11:35,269
LIAM: Hey, y'know, it wasn't fun, but it was
educational, shithead. And I walk over and stop at

1094
01:11:35,269 --> 01:11:37,745
the edge of the stairs going down, you said there
were stairs going down?

1095
01:11:37,745 --> 01:11:39,424
MARISHA: Who the fuck is this guy?

1096
01:11:39,424 --> 01:11:40,827
TALIESIN: I don't know, I certainly like him.

1097
01:11:40,827 --> 01:11:43,162
LIAM: Same thing, I want to see-- could you help
me over here?

1098
01:11:43,162 --> 01:11:45,123
LAURA: I'm looking, I'm checking out those stairs
too.

1099
01:11:45,123 --> 01:11:46,414
LIAM: Wise-arse.

1100
01:11:46,414 --> 01:11:50,919
LAURA: I wouldn't have slid down the fucking
slide, I would assume that leads to death. I don't

1101
01:11:50,919 --> 01:11:54,167
need to throw a pillow down the slide to know--

1102
01:11:54,167 --> 01:11:59,171
LIAM: You are very smart and wise. You know, we
could be dead tomorrow, do you want to keep

1103
01:11:59,171 --> 01:12:00,951
arguing with me like this?

1104
01:12:00,951 --> 01:12:04,063
LAURA: No. 21.

1105
01:12:04,063 --> 01:12:06,635
LIAM: Yeah, I got higher than that. 26.

1106
01:12:06,635 --> 01:12:07,974
LAURA: Dick.

1107
01:12:07,974 --> 01:12:10,112
(laughter)

1108
01:12:10,112 --> 01:12:11,868
TALIESIN: I could watch this all day.

1109
01:12:11,868 --> 01:12:18,471
MATT: The staircase descends, solid stairs.
Partway down, you do see a slight carving in the

1110
01:12:18,471 --> 01:12:25,080
stone, a glyph of some kind that is faintly hidden
with dust and dirt placed to fill the gap. There

1111
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:29,729
is some sort of a symbol ever-so-faintly hidden in
the stone halfway down.

1112
01:12:29,729 --> 01:12:31,076
LAURA: Can we read it? Do we understand it?

1113
01:12:31,076 --> 01:12:37,828
LIAM: D'you know, the last time I saw something
like that, the carpet was fucked. Do you think

1114
01:12:37,828 --> 01:12:39,871
Wilhand would have any idea--?

1115
01:12:39,871 --> 01:12:41,267
LAURA: <i>The</i> carpet?

1116
01:12:41,267 --> 01:12:43,006
LIAM: Yeah, the-- no, the other carpet.

1117
01:12:43,006 --> 01:12:48,411
LAURA: Maybe Scanlan has an idea what it is.
Scanlan!

1118
01:12:48,411 --> 01:12:49,462
SAM: Oi!

1119
01:12:49,462 --> 01:12:51,065
LAURA: You know this rune over here?

1120
01:12:51,065 --> 01:12:53,520
SAM: This-- what? I don't even see what you're
talking about.

1121
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:56,368
LAURA: This little glowy rune right here. Look
closely.

1122
01:12:56,368 --> 01:12:59,569
SAM: Oh! I would've totally missed that.

1123
01:12:59,569 --> 01:13:01,223
(laughter)

1124
01:13:01,223 --> 01:13:06,282
SAM: I think that I have not seen anything like
this before, but have I?

1125
01:13:06,282 --> 01:13:08,317
MATT: Make an arcana check.

1126
01:13:08,317 --> 01:13:11,218
SAM: 13.

1127
01:13:11,218 --> 01:13:19,741
MATT: It appears to be magical in nature. The
symbols elude you, their construct, the arcane

1128
01:13:19,741 --> 01:13:25,259
equation that is based around this, you can't tell
if it's still functional or not, but it is magical

1129
01:13:25,259 --> 01:13:26,623
in its construction.

1130
01:13:26,623 --> 01:13:29,085
SAM: Want to throw a pillow down there?

1131
01:13:29,085 --> 01:13:31,318
LIAM: What an interesting idea.

1132
01:13:31,318 --> 01:13:33,228
LAURA: I go get a pillow and I throw it at the
rune.

1133
01:13:33,228 --> 01:13:34,666
MATT: (laughs) Okay.

1134
01:13:34,666 --> 01:13:36,690
LAURA: How'd it work, does that, is that how
you're supposed to do it?

1135
01:13:36,690 --> 01:13:39,126
MATT: The pillow-- (impact) down the stairs.

1136
01:13:39,126 --> 01:13:40,782
LIAM: Yeah, you did it wrong, see, nothing
happened.

1137
01:13:40,782 --> 01:13:42,343
(laughter)

1138
01:13:42,343 --> 01:13:44,100
SAM: Well, go get the pillow, try again.

1139
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:48,413
MARISHA: Try a lumbar. Maybe a different result.

1140
01:13:48,413 --> 01:13:54,155
LAURA: So wait wait wait, the last time you saw
runes like this, you lost the carpet. How did you

1141
01:13:54,155 --> 01:13:55,518
lose the carpet?

1142
01:13:55,518 --> 01:14:04,599
LIAM: Well, so, did we never talk about that?
Yeah. A bunch of us were riding it-- Ah, it was

1143
01:14:04,599 --> 01:14:08,885
the dwarf, I swear it was the dwarf. We were on
the carpet and there were runes on the walls and

1144
01:14:08,885 --> 01:14:12,977
as soon as we got near the runes the carpet went
(raspberry noise) and fell down.

1145
01:14:12,977 --> 01:14:15,649
LAURA: So it might disenchant whatever we have on
us.

1146
01:14:15,649 --> 01:14:20,104
LIAM: Well, it could do that, it could also-- I
don't know anything about magic, but I assume it

1147
01:14:20,104 --> 01:14:21,342
could burn us.

1148
01:14:21,342 --> 01:14:23,672
LAURA: Well, how do we make it not burn us?

1149
01:14:23,672 --> 01:14:28,673
LIAM: Well. (sighs) I mean. Hey, Shorty, you're
our best bet here, I don't know anything about

1150
01:14:28,673 --> 01:14:29,617
this shit.

1151
01:14:29,617 --> 01:14:30,877
LAURA: Who can undo magical thingies?

1152
01:14:30,877 --> 01:14:32,225
SAM: Not me, Pikey! Pike?

1153
01:14:32,225 --> 01:14:34,954
Pike, you got any undo magicky things?

1154
01:14:34,954 --> 01:14:36,763
MATT: This would be a Dispel Magic spell, for the
record.

1155
01:14:36,763 --> 01:14:38,608
ASHLEY: Yeah, I have Dispel Magic.

1156
01:14:38,608 --> 01:14:39,722
MATT: You have it prepared?

1157
01:14:39,722 --> 01:14:40,752
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1158
01:14:40,752 --> 01:14:42,317
MATT: Then yeah, you could give it a shot.

1159
01:14:42,317 --> 01:14:43,795
SAM: You're my girl!

1160
01:14:43,795 --> 01:14:45,603
TALIESIN: I could try my Dispel Magic ability.

1161
01:14:45,603 --> 01:14:47,303
LIAM: What's that one?

1162
01:14:47,303 --> 01:14:51,301
TALIESIN: It's called a bullet. I'll shoot it
until it doesn't work anymore.

1163
01:14:51,301 --> 01:15:00,278
MATT: All righty. So. Pike. So as you step
forward, they point out this glyph on the wall.

1164
01:15:00,278 --> 01:15:06,626
You're going to cast Dispel Magic on it, I need
you to go ahead and roll a d20 and add your

1165
01:15:06,626 --> 01:15:08,953
spellcasting ability modifier, which--

1166
01:15:08,953 --> 01:15:11,105
LAURA: Whoa! Oh, what is it, what was it?

1167
01:15:11,105 --> 01:15:12,719
LIAM: It's a 20 on the floor!

1168
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:14,407
LAURA: If it was bad it doesn't count, but if it's
good it does.

1169
01:15:14,407 --> 01:15:16,685
MATT: That doesn't count. Roll it intentionally.

1170
01:15:16,685 --> 01:15:18,016
LIAM: Good, because it's not that good.

1171
01:15:18,016 --> 01:15:25,287
MATT: So, your wisdom modifier is actually a five,
because she forgot to add her level 12 bonus we

1172
01:15:25,287 --> 01:15:30,149
discovered recently. So it's now a 20, plus five
on the roll. So go ahead and roll a d20, add five.

1173
01:15:30,149 --> 01:15:34,135
ASHLEY: All right. 18.

1174
01:15:34,135 --> 01:15:40,641
MATT: 18. As you reach up and grab your symbol of
Sarenrae, you focus for a second and there is a

1175
01:15:40,641 --> 01:15:47,244
flash, like a flashbulb. As it flashes, the glyph
glows for a second, and then you hear what sounds

1176
01:15:47,244 --> 01:15:54,353
like a cracking sound. And this glowing energy
seems to shatter, almost like glass made of

1177
01:15:54,353 --> 01:15:59,300
energy. As the energy fades and falls out of the
glyph, it hits the ground and it dissipates into a

1178
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:01,089
light mist that then vanishes.

1179
01:16:01,089 --> 01:16:03,140
LAURA: Good job, Pike!

1180
01:16:03,140 --> 01:16:04,600
ASHLEY: I think it's dispelled?

1181
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:05,953
SAM: I think so.

1182
01:16:05,953 --> 01:16:07,150
LIAM: Good job, Pike.

1183
01:16:07,150 --> 01:16:10,250
ASHLEY: Thanks, Vax.

1184
01:16:10,250 --> 01:16:12,960
MARISHA: We're going up, right? Up or down?

1185
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:14,345
TALIESIN: There were stairs, there was no up.

1186
01:16:14,345 --> 01:16:18,215
LIAM: You don't want to go up, there's no up. Up
is ouchie.

1187
01:16:18,215 --> 01:16:21,801
LAURA: I thought we could skip over that one step
and then there was up.

1188
01:16:21,801 --> 01:16:29,830
MATT: The stairs from underneath go all the way up
to underneath the point, you haven't attempted to

1189
01:16:29,830 --> 01:16:31,547
go over if you wanted to, it's up to you.

1190
01:16:31,547 --> 01:16:33,726
LAURA: Yeah! Yeah, we can jump over that little
gap.

1191
01:16:33,726 --> 01:16:35,277
LIAM: Oh, I thought you said it went to the
ceiling.

1192
01:16:35,277 --> 01:16:40,862
MATT: I mean, the stair illusion is the entire
staircase. But you haven't-- you don't see what's

1193
01:16:40,862 --> 01:16:41,996
on the actual landing.

1194
01:16:41,996 --> 01:16:43,396
MARISHA: You've got the fancy broom.

1195
01:16:43,396 --> 01:16:44,876
LIAM: You got the fancy broom, exactly.

1196
01:16:44,876 --> 01:16:49,901
LAURA: Hmm, all right, I get on the broom and I
float on up to that landing and I look and see if

1197
01:16:49,901 --> 01:16:52,019
there's any traps on the ground. Without setting
foot on it!

1198
01:16:52,019 --> 01:16:57,108
LIAM: I've seen you take other people, can I hang
off the bottom of that thing? Can you carry me up?

1199
01:16:57,108 --> 01:17:00,123
LAURA: I don't know, you're pretty heavy. You
might fit--

1200
01:17:00,123 --> 01:17:01,613
LIAM: I'm lighter than you!

1201
01:17:01,613 --> 01:17:05,950
LAURA: (gasps) It's nothing to brag about,
scrawny.

1202
01:17:05,950 --> 01:17:08,540
LIAM: Look at my constitution, it's very low.

1203
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:12,063
LAURA: Minus two! I am equally scrawny.

1204
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:14,200
(laughter)

1205
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:16,457
TALIESIN: We're learning so much tonight! God!

1206
01:17:16,457 --> 01:17:18,893
LAURA: Dangle well onto the bottom, you can hang
off the bottom of it.

1207
01:17:18,893 --> 01:17:21,014
MARISHA: You guys were born at the same time,
you're both scrawny.

1208
01:17:21,014 --> 01:17:27,715
SAM: If you're going to do this, I insist that we
visually see it with the actual broom.

1209
01:17:27,715 --> 01:17:30,364
(laughter)

1210
01:17:30,364 --> 01:17:32,861
MARISHA: Yes. I second this.

1211
01:17:32,861 --> 01:17:39,920
MATT: So. You get onto the broom, bring yourself
to rise up, speaking the keyword, which is--

1212
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,539
LAURA: (spitting sound)

1213
01:17:41,539 --> 01:17:42,858
MATT: There you go.

1214
01:17:42,858 --> 01:17:44,760
(laughter)

1215
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:47,409
MATT: As you begin to drift up, Vax, you go ahead
and grab onto it.

1216
01:17:47,409 --> 01:17:49,164
LIAM: This is stupid!

1217
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:54,107
MATT: As your weight is lifted by the broom, your
feet actually fall through the illusion itself.

1218
01:17:54,107 --> 01:17:56,673
LAURA: Don't. Fucking. Let go.

1219
01:17:56,673 --> 01:17:59,874
MATT: So you guys watch as the lower half of his
body vanishes against the stairs as he passes

1220
01:17:59,874 --> 01:18:01,192
through it.

1221
01:18:01,192 --> 01:18:03,561
LIAM: (grunts) I'm checking for traps!

1222
01:18:03,561 --> 01:18:05,449
MARISHA: Why is Vax holding on?

1223
01:18:05,449 --> 01:18:07,427
TALIESIN: They're working things out, just let it
happen.

1224
01:18:07,427 --> 01:18:11,650
LIAM: This is a family thing, please keep out!

1225
01:18:11,650 --> 01:18:13,759
(laughter)

1226
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:19,477
MATT: You make your way up to the secondary floor.
Dark up here, you see there are two rooms. Both

1227
01:18:19,477 --> 01:18:27,759
doors are open. The one to the right appears to be
some sort of a desk, study, bookshelves, but all

1228
01:18:27,759 --> 01:18:34,124
the books are gone. The desk appears to be cleaned
out. Actually, all the drawers are open and there

1229
01:18:34,124 --> 01:18:39,660
are a couple of haphazard writing utensils that
have dropped on the floor, but it looks like Quall

1230
01:18:39,660 --> 01:18:44,058
was trying to leave in a hurry, grabbed most of
what was important to him. Except for one thing,

1231
01:18:44,058 --> 01:18:46,310
which is what he sent you here to get.

1232
01:18:46,310 --> 01:18:51,805
MARISHA: I was going to be like: look for the
circlet!

1233
01:18:51,805 --> 01:18:53,097
LAURA: Obviously!

1234
01:18:53,097 --> 01:18:55,336
MARISHA: Just a reminder.

1235
01:18:55,336 --> 01:18:56,478
LIAM: Thank you.

1236
01:18:56,478 --> 01:19:03,647
MATT: The other one appears to be a bedroom, there
appears to be a garish canopy bed with like spiral

1237
01:19:03,647 --> 01:19:06,239
edges, with like little gold-leaf imprints into
it--

1238
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:15,492
LAURA: Ooh, Master Quall was a little freaky I
think. Can we look under the bed?

1239
01:19:15,492 --> 01:19:18,211
LAURA: Traps, traps, under the bed. I want to look
under the bed.

1240
01:19:18,211 --> 01:19:20,421
LIAM: Under the bed, in the bed, around the bed.

1241
01:19:20,421 --> 01:19:23,535
LAURA: 17?

1242
01:19:23,535 --> 01:19:26,193
LIAM: 23.

1243
01:19:26,193 --> 01:19:29,284
MATT: Okay. This room does not appear to be
trapped.

1244
01:19:29,284 --> 01:19:30,979
LAURA: Can I look under the bed?

1245
01:19:30,979 --> 01:19:36,514
MATT: You look under the bed. Under the bed there
is a small chest that is pushed to the very back,

1246
01:19:36,514 --> 01:19:37,837
you pull it out, shhk.

1247
01:19:37,837 --> 01:19:39,486
LAURA: I check for traps on the chest.

1248
01:19:39,486 --> 01:19:41,327
LIAM: I take three steps back away from my
sister.

1249
01:19:41,327 --> 01:19:42,703
TRAVIS: You've made her very cautious.

1250
01:19:42,703 --> 01:19:46,242
MATT: I, as it tends to. Go ahead and make an
investigation check now.

1251
01:19:46,242 --> 01:19:51,870
LAURA: 26.

1252
01:19:51,870 --> 01:19:54,379
MATT: 26. The chest does not appear to be
trapped.

1253
01:19:54,379 --> 01:19:55,526
SAM: Ooh, good!

1254
01:19:55,526 --> 01:19:56,717
LAURA: I try to open it.

1255
01:19:56,717 --> 01:19:57,682
MATT: It is locked.

1256
01:19:57,682 --> 01:19:59,922
LAURA: It's locked, it's locked, open it. Open
it.

1257
01:19:59,922 --> 01:20:02,217
LIAM: You're so good at all my tricks, are you
sure?

1258
01:20:02,217 --> 01:20:04,658
LAURA: Do you want me to try to pick this lock?

1259
01:20:04,658 --> 01:20:07,315
Because I am very talented as a rogue.

1260
01:20:07,315 --> 01:20:10,858
LIAM: You are extremely talented and you're going
to get better and better every day.

1261
01:20:10,858 --> 01:20:12,268
LAURA: Well then fine, I'll try to unlock it.

1262
01:20:12,268 --> 01:20:14,522
LIAM: All right. I take five more steps backward.

1263
01:20:14,522 --> 01:20:17,079
(laughter)

1264
01:20:17,079 --> 01:20:20,505
MATT: Okay. So you go ahead and take out your
lockpick.

1265
01:20:20,505 --> 01:20:22,552
LAURA: Is this how you hold it? This is how you
hold it, then?

1266
01:20:22,552 --> 01:20:24,403
LIAM: Hey man, I don't want to harsh your mellow.

1267
01:20:24,403 --> 01:20:34,019
MATT: Go ahead and roll a d20, add your dex and
your proficiency bonus, you're proficient in the tools.

1268
01:20:34,019 --> 01:20:41,936
LAURA: 24. 24. Is that saving throws or regular?
Okay, yeah, 24.

1269
01:20:41,936 --> 01:20:45,033
MATT: (click) The lock is open.

1270
01:20:45,033 --> 01:20:46,390
LAURA: Hey, look at that!

1271
01:20:46,390 --> 01:20:47,843
LIAM: Good job, that's a good job.

1272
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:50,120
LAURA: Thank you. All the gold, all the gold.

1273
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:59,591
MATT: Open it. There's a handful of copper. Looks
like the other thing that was within this chest

1274
01:20:59,591 --> 01:21:01,667
was also taken by Quall on his way out.

1275
01:21:01,667 --> 01:21:04,560
LAURA: Ugh. Why would he take the shit out and
then lock it and put it back under the bed?

1276
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:05,934
What a douche.

1277
01:21:05,934 --> 01:21:11,318
LIAM: And aside from traps, is there any like,
paintings with eyeholes cut in it for peeking or

1278
01:21:11,318 --> 01:21:13,951
little holes in the wall?

1279
01:21:13,951 --> 01:21:15,572
TALIESIN: Check the chest.

1280
01:21:15,572 --> 01:21:18,158
LIAM: What, Percy?

1281
01:21:18,158 --> 01:21:19,569
TALIESIN: Check the chest.

1282
01:21:19,569 --> 01:21:22,627
LIAM: Does it have a false bottom? The chest.

1283
01:21:22,627 --> 01:21:24,759
MATT: It does.

1284
01:21:24,759 --> 01:21:27,611
(cheering)

1285
01:21:27,611 --> 01:21:30,553
LIAM: C'mon, don't leave me hanging, what the
hell!

1286
01:21:30,553 --> 01:21:33,794
MATT: You move some of the copper out of the way,
and you feel for it, as you push on one corner,

1287
01:21:33,794 --> 01:21:39,699
the floor of the actual chest shifts a little bit.
You lift it up and--

1288
01:21:39,699 --> 01:21:44,209
LIAM: You've always got to check it for a false
bottom.

1289
01:21:44,209 --> 01:21:45,464
LAURA: I did, I did, I checked!

1290
01:21:45,464 --> 01:21:46,456
LIAM: You didn't say shit!

1291
01:21:46,456 --> 01:21:49,076
LAURA: I was saying it, I said I'm checking all
around the fucking chest, that's what I said!

1292
01:21:49,076 --> 01:21:51,438
LIAM: Hmmm, I didn't hear the words 'false bottom'
out loud.

1293
01:21:51,438 --> 01:21:52,980
LAURA: Oh my god.

1294
01:21:52,980 --> 01:21:58,618
MATT: At the bottom of this you see a key. A
single brass-colored key.

1295
01:21:58,618 --> 01:21:59,717
LAURA: It's a key.

1296
01:21:59,717 --> 01:22:01,401
LIAM: That's right, you're smart.

1297
01:22:01,401 --> 01:22:06,860
LAURA: You know what? We're going to get
downstairs and this key is going to unlock the

1298
01:22:06,860 --> 01:22:08,893
thing that has the circlet, I know it.

1299
01:22:08,893 --> 01:22:10,712
LIAM: I think you're right. You know what else?

1300
01:22:10,712 --> 01:22:11,749
LAURA: What?

1301
01:22:11,749 --> 01:22:13,306
LIAM: We don't need to argue like this.

1302
01:22:13,306 --> 01:22:16,995
LAURA: I love you.

1303
01:22:16,995 --> 01:22:18,092
LIAM: Yeah?

1304
01:22:18,092 --> 01:22:19,137
LAURA: Yeah.

1305
01:22:19,137 --> 01:22:21,029
LIAM: Why're you always busting my balls, then?

1306
01:22:21,029 --> 01:22:22,273
LAURA: Because it's fun.

1307
01:22:22,273 --> 01:22:24,556
LIAM: I'm sure it is, but y'know, getting hit in
the nuts hurts.

1308
01:22:24,556 --> 01:22:29,579
TALIESIN: Double-check the bedroom for safes or
things behind paintings or maybe

1309
01:22:29,579 --> 01:22:30,489
some sort of carpet--

1310
01:22:30,489 --> 01:22:32,018
LAURA: I'm sorry, who's talking, who is this?

1311
01:22:32,018 --> 01:22:34,254
TALIESIN: It's the voice of reason, coming from
downstairs.

1312
01:22:34,254 --> 01:22:35,672
(laughter)

1313
01:22:35,672 --> 01:22:37,416
LIAM: Is it, though? Is it really?

1314
01:22:37,416 --> 01:22:40,648
TALIESIN: I know, I'm just as depressed that it is
as you are.

1315
01:22:40,648 --> 01:22:44,375
LAURA: I double-check the room for-- What would
you like me to look for again?

1316
01:22:44,375 --> 01:22:52,414
TALIESIN: Check paintings, behind the paintings,
check the bed for any odd slidey bits.

1317
01:22:52,414 --> 01:22:55,697
MARISHA: Percy is a paranoid rich person, so he
knows things about them.

1318
01:22:55,697 --> 01:22:57,702
TALIESIN: Trust paranoid rich people to know.

1319
01:22:57,702 --> 01:23:01,552
MATT: Make a general investigation check
throughout the room as you search for any nooks

1320
01:23:01,552 --> 01:23:03,497
and crannies, hidden spaces.

1321
01:23:03,497 --> 01:23:04,830
LAURA: I rolled a one.

1322
01:23:04,830 --> 01:23:07,727
LIAM: Well, investigation again? 20.

1323
01:23:07,727 --> 01:23:12,672
MATT: Okay. You come to the conclusion that there
is nothing else to find in this room.

1324
01:23:12,672 --> 01:23:14,797
LAURA: Nothing else to find, I found the key,
dammit.

1325
01:23:14,797 --> 01:23:22,200
MATT: You look behind one of the paintings, and--
it's a wall behind it.

1326
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:24,158
(laughter)

1327
01:23:24,158 --> 01:23:28,421
MATT: The room appears to be for the most part
cleaned out from your discovery here.

1328
01:23:28,421 --> 01:23:31,269
LIAM: There was more than one room though, right?
You said--

1329
01:23:31,269 --> 01:23:34,339
LAURA: Yeah, we checked all the rooms. We checked
the other room already.

1330
01:23:34,339 --> 01:23:39,347
MATT: You checked the bedroom, now you looked
within the office study with a desk and all the

1331
01:23:39,347 --> 01:23:42,645
drawers were left open and things have already
been taken from the room.

1332
01:23:42,645 --> 01:23:45,563
LIAM: Okay, let's take that key downstairs. As you
said.

1333
01:23:45,563 --> 01:23:47,160
LAURA: Hop on the broom.

1334
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:52,885
LIAM: I don't want to sit behind you, I'll hang
from it again. It's gross.

1335
01:23:52,885 --> 01:23:55,797
LAURA: You can sit sidesaddle.

1336
01:23:55,797 --> 01:23:59,697
MATT: You glide your way down, back to the main
floor. You guys are now at the top of the stairs

1337
01:23:59,697 --> 01:24:01,745
leading into the basement, what're you going to
do?

1338
01:24:01,745 --> 01:24:03,102
SAM: Let's go down to the basement!

1339
01:24:03,102 --> 01:24:04,415
LAURA: Hey, I like this plan.

1340
01:24:04,415 --> 01:24:06,284
LIAM: Oh, yeah. I'll go a little ways ahead.

1341
01:24:06,284 --> 01:24:08,180
LAURA: (whispers) Look, Percy, I found a key!

1342
01:24:08,180 --> 01:24:10,845
LIAM: Checking for traps. Past-- I'll go up to the
sigil.

1343
01:24:10,845 --> 01:24:14,503
MATT: So roll a dexterity saving throw.

1344
01:24:14,503 --> 01:24:16,511
LIAM: Oh, shite.

1345
01:24:16,511 --> 01:24:18,414
LAURA: What did you just do?

1346
01:24:18,414 --> 01:24:22,342
LIAM: I don't know but I will have a high-- 23.

1347
01:24:22,342 --> 01:24:27,025
MATT: Okay. As you step past the glyph, the wood
beneath your foot creaks and you instinctually

1348
01:24:27,025 --> 01:24:29,711
leap forward, landing on your feet. Nothing
happens.

1349
01:24:29,711 --> 01:24:31,266
(laughter)

1350
01:24:31,266 --> 01:24:34,253
LIAM: I love you, Matt, so much.

1351
01:24:34,253 --> 01:24:35,610
(laughter)

1352
01:24:35,610 --> 01:24:42,031
LIAM: You just always have to be alert, you never
know, sometimes you think you know but you don't

1353
01:24:42,031 --> 01:24:43,406
actually know!

1354
01:24:43,406 --> 01:24:45,681
SAM: There was nothing there, Vax.

1355
01:24:45,681 --> 01:24:47,065
LIAM: Now I know.

1356
01:24:47,065 --> 01:24:50,342
MARISHA: The PTSD is really starting to sink in.

1357
01:24:50,342 --> 01:24:51,899
LIAM: Three-point landing! Okay, we're fine!

1358
01:24:51,899 --> 01:24:55,966
MARISHA: While they were up there dicking around,
we were looking around at the middle floor,

1359
01:24:55,966 --> 01:24:57,285
anything good?

1360
01:24:57,285 --> 01:25:00,809
SAM: No, we were not going anywhere near the
pressure points, by the way.

1361
01:25:00,809 --> 01:25:03,964
MARISHA: Well, that is without being said.

1362
01:25:03,964 --> 01:25:09,809
MATT: I mean, other than the rooms you guys went
into, there was the dining room area and the

1363
01:25:09,809 --> 01:25:11,140
kitchen area.

1364
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:12,619
MARISHA: Anything good that looks--

1365
01:25:12,619 --> 01:25:14,322
MATT: Investigation checks from both you guys.

1366
01:25:14,322 --> 01:25:17,258
TALIESIN: I hate investigation checks.

1367
01:25:17,258 --> 01:25:21,599
TALIESIN: 13.

1368
01:25:21,599 --> 01:25:24,092
MARISHA: 19.

1369
01:25:24,092 --> 01:25:28,929
MATT: Okay. Are you letting them wander and you're
staying where you are?

1370
01:25:28,929 --> 01:25:33,303
SAM: I'm not going with them. No way, there are
terrible bombs and stuff there.

1371
01:25:33,303 --> 01:25:39,157
MATT: All right. So, Keyleth, you wander through
the dining area towards the kitchen--

1372
01:25:39,157 --> 01:25:40,775
MARISHA: Being very gentle.

1373
01:25:40,775 --> 01:25:44,307
MATT: Percy, you scope around the other side,
checking around elements--

1374
01:25:44,307 --> 01:25:46,045
TALIESIN: Not touching anything, just looking.

1375
01:25:46,045 --> 01:25:52,482
MATT: Right. Nothing catches your attention
specifically. You get to the kitchen, the kitchen

1376
01:25:52,482 --> 01:26:00,071
is cold, layer of dust. Doesn't appear to be
anything of particular interest in there.

1377
01:26:00,071 --> 01:26:02,550
TALIESIN: Hm. All right.

1378
01:26:02,550 --> 01:26:03,939
MARISHA: Okay.

1379
01:26:03,939 --> 01:26:05,266
TALIESIN: Downstairs it is.

1380
01:26:05,266 --> 01:26:07,863
LIAM: You know what, appreciate your rogues is all
I'm saying, am I right or am I right?

1381
01:26:07,863 --> 01:26:13,993
MATT: So. You guys who wish to head down into the
basement--

1382
01:26:13,993 --> 01:26:15,298
SAM: I'm going downstairs.

1383
01:26:15,298 --> 01:26:17,678
MATT: Grog, you're still staying outside?

1384
01:26:17,678 --> 01:26:21,059
TRAVIS: Yeah, actually, can Trinket and I walk to
the other side of the street?

1385
01:26:21,059 --> 01:26:22,506
LAURA: Trinket's in my locket.

1386
01:26:22,506 --> 01:26:24,110
TRAVIS: Can I walk to the other side of the
street?

1387
01:26:24,110 --> 01:26:25,461
LAURA: But do you want Trinket with you?

1388
01:26:25,461 --> 01:26:26,748
TRAVIS: No.

1389
01:26:26,748 --> 01:26:28,849
MATT: Okay, so you walk to the other side of the
street on your own.

1390
01:26:28,849 --> 01:26:31,304
TRAVIS: Yeah, and I watch the house from across
the street.

1391
01:26:31,304 --> 01:26:33,117
LIAM: Stakeout.

1392
01:26:33,117 --> 01:26:37,553
TRAVIS: Yeah, since this is taking a bit, it's not
a short rest is it, if I'm chilling?

1393
01:26:37,553 --> 01:26:42,961
MATT: I mean, if you sit for like up to half an
hour or an hour rest, then yeah.

1394
01:26:42,961 --> 01:26:44,379
TRAVIS: Nah, I'm just watching.

1395
01:26:44,379 --> 01:26:49,805
MATT: Okay. All right, you guys make it down to
the basement area. This is a very, very small

1396
01:26:49,805 --> 01:26:57,994
room, 20 by 20 feet, and there is a door, a big
heavy-ass metallic door that has--

1397
01:26:57,994 --> 01:27:00,760
LIAM: --a keyhole?

1398
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:02,824
MATT: A very specific keyhole, yes.

1399
01:27:02,824 --> 01:27:07,244
LIAM: Wait wait wait wait-- Yes, yes we will, but
hold on, can I have a look at it? Can you have a

1400
01:27:07,244 --> 01:27:09,246
look at it? We'll just take a look. And then you
do it.

1401
01:27:09,246 --> 01:27:11,549
MARISHA: Aw, look, they're doing it together.

1402
01:27:11,549 --> 01:27:12,979
TALIESIN: It's adorable, isn't it?

1403
01:27:12,979 --> 01:27:15,410
LIAM: Shut up back there! It's easy to make
mistakes!

1404
01:27:15,410 --> 01:27:20,273
LAURA: 25.

1405
01:27:20,273 --> 01:27:22,004
LIAM: 20.

1406
01:27:22,004 --> 01:27:31,618
MATT: There is some sort of an enchantment on the
door, and the keyhole area itself. You can't

1407
01:27:31,618 --> 01:27:37,904
ascertain the nature of it, but as you approach
you can see that the metallic sheen shimmers

1408
01:27:37,904 --> 01:27:42,130
without the light changing. There is something
about it that is unnatural.

1409
01:27:42,130 --> 01:27:43,436
LIAM: Shit.

1410
01:27:43,436 --> 01:27:49,067
LAURA: (whispers) Hey, Pike. Do you think you can
try dispelling magic again? Because there's some

1411
01:27:49,067 --> 01:27:51,592
shimmery sort of shit on this door and I don't
trust it.

1412
01:27:51,592 --> 01:27:54,200
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's really pretty, but lemme give
it a try.

1413
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:56,327
MARISHA: It's iridescent!

1414
01:27:56,327 --> 01:27:57,824
ASHLEY: Let's leave it, it's so pretty!

1415
01:27:57,824 --> 01:28:00,558
SAM: Wait wait wait. Before you dispel the
magic--

1416
01:28:00,558 --> 01:28:01,681
LAURA: What?

1417
01:28:01,681 --> 01:28:05,931
SAM: Maybe it's good, maybe that's how the key
works? If you dispel the magic, maybe the key

1418
01:28:05,931 --> 01:28:07,518
won't work anymore, I don't know.

1419
01:28:07,518 --> 01:28:09,560
ASHLEY: I mean, that key was hidden for a reason.

1420
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:11,726
SAM: Is there magic on the key?

1421
01:28:11,726 --> 01:28:17,723
LAURA: If I stick it in and I turn it and it
explodes and I die, oh, I don't know, that's never

1422
01:28:17,723 --> 01:28:18,965
happened before--

1423
01:28:18,965 --> 01:28:21,081
SAM: Okay, dispel the magic, yeah, no that's
good.

1424
01:28:21,081 --> 01:28:26,117
ASHLEY: I might need some extra help because I
only got a ten.

1425
01:28:26,117 --> 01:28:31,622
SAM: Can I inspire her retroactively?

1426
01:28:31,622 --> 01:28:32,961
MATT: Nope.

1427
01:28:32,961 --> 01:28:39,771
As you mark off your second third-level
spell, releasing the Dispel Magic, the shimmer

1428
01:28:39,771 --> 01:28:44,718
intensifies for a moment on the door and then
returns to its natural state.

1429
01:28:44,718 --> 01:28:45,778
LAURA: Shit.

1430
01:28:45,778 --> 01:28:47,308
SAM: I think it worked.

1431
01:28:47,308 --> 01:28:50,999
TALIESIN: Do we have anybody who has Telekinesis?
Telekinesis of any kind?

1432
01:28:50,999 --> 01:28:52,949
MARISHA: Telekinesis? No.

1433
01:28:52,949 --> 01:28:57,918
SAM: Wait, I can have, I can have someone--

1434
01:28:57,918 --> 01:28:59,335
LAURA: Oh, your invisible servant!

1435
01:28:59,335 --> 01:29:01,720
SAM: I can have someone turn the key, if that's
what we're talking about.

1436
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:02,980
LAURA: Yeah, go do that!

1437
01:29:02,980 --> 01:29:04,796
TALIESIN: Make someone expendable, it's a
brilliant idea.

1438
01:29:04,796 --> 01:29:10,212
LAURA: Let's all step back, step way back. Back it
up, back it up.

1439
01:29:10,212 --> 01:29:11,385
MARISHA: Wait wait wait.

1440
01:29:11,385 --> 01:29:12,582
LAURA: What?

1441
01:29:12,582 --> 01:29:16,000
MARISHA: What if it explodes the lock and then
we're not able to get in at all?

1442
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,804
SAM: Then waah, we go kill a dragon instead.

1443
01:29:17,804 --> 01:29:20,640
LIAM: Well. Sort of, yeah yeah yeah.

1444
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:23,922
TALIESIN: Then at dawn, we talk about things.

1445
01:29:23,922 --> 01:29:27,282
SAM: At dawn, we discuss!

1446
01:29:27,282 --> 01:29:28,888
MARISHA: We plan!

1447
01:29:28,888 --> 01:29:30,008
SAM: At dawn!

1448
01:29:30,008 --> 01:29:33,132
TRAVIS: I already had my great moment, all right?

1449
01:29:33,132 --> 01:29:36,883
MATT: So what're you doing, Scanlan?

1450
01:29:36,883 --> 01:29:41,923
SAM: Can Unseen Servant carry a key, or is it more
Mage Hand-y?

1451
01:29:41,923 --> 01:29:45,372
MATT: Yeah, I mean, a key's not-- Mage Hand can
even do five pounds on its own.

1452
01:29:45,372 --> 01:29:50,219
SAM: I'll do Unseen Servant, named Mort.

1453
01:29:50,219 --> 01:29:51,367
ALL: Mort.

1454
01:29:51,367 --> 01:29:55,834
MATT: There's a slight shift of wind. And while
you guys see nothing after the wind fades, you

1455
01:29:55,834 --> 01:29:57,342
know Mort is with you.

1456
01:29:57,342 --> 01:30:01,379
LAURA: I'm holding the key up to Mort. I don't
know where he is.

1457
01:30:01,379 --> 01:30:04,748
SAM: He's right in front of you! Don't be rude to
Mort!

1458
01:30:04,748 --> 01:30:06,652
MATT: Nothing happens.

1459
01:30:06,652 --> 01:30:09,801
SAM: Oh. Mort. Take the key.

1460
01:30:09,801 --> 01:30:11,298
MATT: The key lifts out of your hand.

1461
01:30:11,298 --> 01:30:14,017
TALIESIN: That's very unsettling.

1462
01:30:14,017 --> 01:30:15,832
MATT: It's now in the middle of the air.

1463
01:30:15,832 --> 01:30:17,731
TALIESIN: Okay, let's everyone back up.

1464
01:30:17,731 --> 01:30:22,035
SAM: I have to wait six seconds. All right.

1465
01:30:22,035 --> 01:30:31,096
MARISHA: I want to throw up a Gust cantrip in
front of us to help shield us if anything happens.

1466
01:30:31,156 --> 01:30:36,695
MATT: A light breeze shimmers before you. What're
you going to do?

1467
01:30:36,695 --> 01:30:40,584
SAM: Mort. Open the door with the key.

1468
01:30:40,584 --> 01:30:48,018
MATT: The key drifts over, finds, turns, enters
the keyhole. Turns to the side. The metal around

1469
01:30:48,018 --> 01:30:53,365
the keyhole begins to glow brighter and brighter
and brighter for a second. The outer rim of the

1470
01:30:53,365 --> 01:30:57,901
door itself begins to glow accordingly, like the
actual frame of the metal door begins to go from

1471
01:30:57,901 --> 01:31:07,820
this dull, dull old iron look to this almost red to
orange to white-hot vision and then fades to

1472
01:31:07,820 --> 01:31:10,114
darkness, and the door (creaking).

1473
01:31:10,114 --> 01:31:11,825
SAM: Would've burned us!

1474
01:31:11,825 --> 01:31:13,712
LAURA: Hey, maybe?

1475
01:31:13,712 --> 01:31:16,475
LIAM: Not us, not us.

1476
01:31:16,475 --> 01:31:17,546
LAURA: Yeah.

1477
01:31:17,546 --> 01:31:20,444
MARISHA: Is your unseen servant okay?

1478
01:31:20,444 --> 01:31:23,503
SAM: Ah, he's fine, yeah? He's fine.

1479
01:31:23,503 --> 01:31:26,166
LAURA: I walk through the gust of wind and get my
hair tousled.

1480
01:31:26,166 --> 01:31:30,723
MATT: You go through. Your hair gets tousled. You
unintentionally shoulder-check Mort.

1481
01:31:30,723 --> 01:31:32,696
LAURA: Sorry, Mort.

1482
01:31:32,696 --> 01:31:37,771
LIAM: I'm going to see if I can see any traps
inside the room.

1483
01:31:37,771 --> 01:31:39,771
MATT: Sure. Investigation check.

1484
01:31:39,771 --> 01:31:44,506
LIAM: Yeah. Doesn't matter. 20.

1485
01:31:44,506 --> 01:31:52,975
MATT: Stepping into the room, you do see that this
is a chamber familiar to you. You actually had a

1486
01:31:52,975 --> 01:32:00,394
room similar to this in your keep. This is,
specifically, an arcane sanctuary. This is used

1487
01:32:00,394 --> 01:32:07,141
for the construction and the enchantment and the
development of various arcane items. Similar to--

1488
01:32:07,141 --> 01:32:13,283
you've seen the chamber before at Gilmore's,
although on smaller scale. This has seen various

1489
01:32:13,283 --> 01:32:17,114
types of use. There's an alchemical setup in one
corner, untouched.

1490
01:32:17,114 --> 01:32:21,771
LIAM: Wait, Scanlan.

1491
01:32:21,771 --> 01:32:22,852
SAM: Oi!

1492
01:32:22,852 --> 01:32:27,015
LIAM: Would you and your light-footed friend like
to join me in here?

1493
01:32:27,015 --> 01:32:28,430
SAM: Sure, I'll come.

1494
01:32:28,430 --> 01:32:29,376
LIAM: Yeah?

1495
01:32:29,376 --> 01:32:31,659
SAM: Yes. Mort. Join me.

1496
01:32:31,659 --> 01:32:33,691
MATT: Mort has joined you.

1497
01:32:33,691 --> 01:32:34,653
SAM: Okay.

1498
01:32:34,653 --> 01:32:39,192
LIAM: I don't want to touch anything in here. I
don't see any traps--

1499
01:32:39,192 --> 01:32:41,413
TALIESIN: I want to touch everything in here.

1500
01:32:41,413 --> 01:32:42,579
MARISHA: I do too.

1501
01:32:42,579 --> 01:32:45,251
LIAM: Have at it. And I back up.

1502
01:32:45,251 --> 01:32:48,101
SAM: All right, let's go pillage! I'll start
looking around and looting.

1503
01:32:48,101 --> 01:32:49,528
MATT: Perception check.

1504
01:32:49,528 --> 01:32:52,991
TALIESIN: I'm going to gingerly start looking to
see if anything is useful, because I have

1505
01:32:52,991 --> 01:32:54,141
a lot of plans.

1506
01:32:54,141 --> 01:32:55,802
MATT: Okay.

1507
01:32:55,802 --> 01:32:56,952
SAM: Five.

1508
01:32:56,952 --> 01:33:01,508
MATT: The architecture catches your attention.

1509
01:33:01,508 --> 01:33:02,943
SAM: Ahh, it's beautiful.

1510
01:33:02,943 --> 01:33:04,127
TALIESIN: 14.

1511
01:33:04,127 --> 01:33:06,437
MATT: Okay. And what did you say you were going to
do?

1512
01:33:06,437 --> 01:33:08,881
MARISHA: I wanted to head towards the alchemical
stuff to see if there's--

1513
01:33:08,881 --> 01:33:10,652
MATT: Setup, okay, there's various glass
beakers--

1514
01:33:10,652 --> 01:33:11,938
MARISHA: Supplies.

1515
01:33:11,938 --> 01:33:16,703
MATT: I mean, there are supplies. You can see
there are. There is a small rack that has many

1516
01:33:16,703 --> 01:33:23,684
glass vials that contain ground materials,
liquids, various metals, they're all labeled--

1517
01:33:23,684 --> 01:33:25,990
what languages do you know?

1518
01:33:25,990 --> 01:33:30,890
MARISHA: Primordial, Druidic, Sylvan. Elven.

1519
01:33:30,890 --> 01:33:35,411
MATT: Oh, Elven? You're not able to read the
actual label.

1520
01:33:35,411 --> 01:33:39,430
TALIESIN: Celestial. Can I read any of it?

1521
01:33:39,430 --> 01:33:40,941
MATT: What other languages do you know?

1522
01:33:40,941 --> 01:33:42,696
TALIESIN: Common, Celestial, Elven.

1523
01:33:42,696 --> 01:33:44,004
MATT: Also can't read it.

1524
01:33:44,004 --> 01:33:49,526
TALIESIN: Would I recognize any of the alchemical
symbols?

1525
01:33:49,526 --> 01:33:57,371
MATT: From what you can tell, there's symbols for,
you know, mercurial liquid metals. There are many

1526
01:33:57,371 --> 01:34:04,967
different herbal elements that are in here. There
are a few that the design on the label shows

1527
01:34:04,967 --> 01:34:13,403
toxicity. You see there are iron filings, all
these things that are used in various-- You have

1528
01:34:13,403 --> 01:34:15,253
the brew potion ability, correct?

1529
01:34:15,253 --> 01:34:16,231
MARISHA: Yeah.

1530
01:34:16,231 --> 01:34:21,133
MATT: So you also recognize some of these are used
in the process of preparing liquids with an

1531
01:34:21,133 --> 01:34:25,303
easy-to-accept presentation when you're enchanting
and brewing a potion.

1532
01:34:25,303 --> 01:34:28,360
MARISHA: I start clearing out the materials and
throw them in my bag.

1533
01:34:28,360 --> 01:34:29,455
MATT: Okay.

1534
01:34:29,455 --> 01:34:31,822
LAURA: Can I look around for a fucking circlet?

1535
01:34:31,822 --> 01:34:32,892
MATT: Go for it.

1536
01:34:32,892 --> 01:34:34,892
MARISHA: What were you saying, Scanlan?

1537
01:34:34,892 --> 01:34:39,077
SAM: Don't you have some ability that you can find
magical objects?

1538
01:34:39,077 --> 01:34:40,899
LAURA: 16.

1539
01:34:40,899 --> 01:34:49,256
MATT: 16? You look around the room. You don't see
a circlet, but what you do notice in the far end

1540
01:34:49,256 --> 01:35:01,018
of the room is a 12-foot-tall humanoid structure
built of solid stone that stands there looming

1541
01:35:01,018 --> 01:35:08,857
across the way. Giant piston-like stone arms, tree
trunk-like legs. You've encountered something like

1542
01:35:08,857 --> 01:35:10,055
this before--

1543
01:35:10,055 --> 01:35:12,106
LAURA: Yes. That looks very similar.

1544
01:35:12,106 --> 01:35:14,447
LIAM: With Grog's dead dad.

1545
01:35:14,447 --> 01:35:18,202
MATT: Well, no, this was in the druid barrows--

1546
01:35:18,202 --> 01:35:27,706
LAURA: A golem that was up in the wall. How about
we tie its legs up? Just like we did before. Just

1547
01:35:27,706 --> 01:35:30,526
in case he comes alive, then he can trip and
fall.

1548
01:35:30,526 --> 01:35:35,610
MARISHA: Well, I'm assuming it's there in case
someone breaks in, like would trigger a trap.

1549
01:35:35,610 --> 01:35:37,525
LAURA: I don't care, I start tying a rope around
his legs.

1550
01:35:37,525 --> 01:35:41,360
LIAM: Yeah, don't we have that neverending rope?
Let's do it like 200 times around.

1551
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:46,460
MATT: All right. As you approach the giant stone
entity, pulling the rope out, you can see,

1552
01:35:46,460 --> 01:35:53,455
embedded in the chest, there's a little slit, a
very, very tiny slit in its stone chest. You see a

1553
01:35:53,455 --> 01:35:59,968
faint blue sparking glow, the very same color of
the cortex that you had recovered from the druid

1554
01:35:59,968 --> 01:36:06,003
barrows when you were originally hired by Drez
Vina to recover it. As you see this and you

1555
01:36:06,003 --> 01:36:08,816
approach, it doesn't seem to react.

1556
01:36:08,816 --> 01:36:16,075
MARISHA: Right. Wait. And Drez sent us out through
Quall.

1557
01:36:16,075 --> 01:36:17,646
LAURA: Yeah.

1558
01:36:17,646 --> 01:36:19,116
MATT: The Master's who hired you.

1559
01:36:19,116 --> 01:36:23,226
LAURA: Yeah yeah yeah. So we fought this other
thing because of Quall.

1560
01:36:23,226 --> 01:36:27,892
MARISHA: So why are these things showing up
wherever we go for Quall?

1561
01:36:27,892 --> 01:36:30,092
LAURA: Well, because that's what he does.

1562
01:36:30,092 --> 01:36:35,690
MATT: Well, the first one you encountered was
built for the barrow from whoever was in charge--

1563
01:36:35,690 --> 01:36:38,962
LAURA: He wanted the orb to bring this thing to
life.

1564
01:36:38,962 --> 01:36:44,796
MARISHA: Oh, that's right, and now he made-- now
we see the fruits of our labor. I see.

1565
01:36:44,796 --> 01:36:45,891
SAM: We made this thing?

1566
01:36:45,891 --> 01:36:51,910
MARISHA: We brought back the crystal so he could
make this thing.

1567
01:36:51,910 --> 01:36:53,298
SAM: Wow.

1568
01:36:53,298 --> 01:36:57,731
TALIESIN: I have no idea what you're talking
about.

1569
01:36:57,731 --> 01:37:00,810
LAURA: If I take a step forward, does he look like
it has any kind of reaction?

1570
01:37:00,810 --> 01:37:04,073
MATT: You take a step forward. No reaction.

1571
01:37:04,073 --> 01:37:08,626
LAURA: I'm going to keep trying to tie around his
legs.

1572
01:37:08,626 --> 01:37:11,871
LIAM: I'll help her out, and we'll go back and
back and all around.

1573
01:37:11,871 --> 01:37:14,503
MATT: Okay. You guys bring the rope around and you
tie it pretty taut around the legs, which are

1574
01:37:14,503 --> 01:37:19,345
pretty close together. They're not like in a wide
aggressive stance. It's standing there inert. You

1575
01:37:19,345 --> 01:37:22,525
wrap the rope around it multiple times, give it
the best knots that you have.

1576
01:37:22,525 --> 01:37:26,520
LAURA: All right, well. I feel safer.

1577
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:34,248
LIAM: I grab-- in my bag I have the charcoal that
I once painted half a beard on Grog with, and I

1578
01:37:34,248 --> 01:37:38,412
use it to draw a little curly mustache on it.

1579
01:37:38,412 --> 01:37:39,908
LAURA: Really?

1580
01:37:39,908 --> 01:37:44,062
MATT: Okay, so as you climb to the top and you get
up there and smear this big ol' Pringles can-style

1581
01:37:44,062 --> 01:37:49,032
mustache out of charcoal on the front of this
stone golem's featureless face.

1582
01:37:49,032 --> 01:37:51,121
Now it has personality.

1583
01:37:51,121 --> 01:37:56,028
LAURA: Can you try to look at its chest? It has a
little blue glimmer in it. Climb down and look and

1584
01:37:56,028 --> 01:37:57,078
see if you can--

1585
01:37:57,078 --> 01:38:02,562
LIAM: Yeah, I'm more comfortable drawing mustaches
on it than I am dickering with its power source.

1586
01:38:02,562 --> 01:38:04,160
LAURA: Just look and see what it is.

1587
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:08,307
LIAM: I look at the crystal, admire it, go
dink-dink with a knuckle.

1588
01:38:08,307 --> 01:38:11,994
MATT: You glance through this little slit and it's
about that wide, like you can barely see the

1589
01:38:11,994 --> 01:38:17,204
flicker, and the stone is about a good foot and a
half, two feet deep before you even see the source

1590
01:38:17,204 --> 01:38:22,942
of the light. It's a very, very thin slit to it,
and from what little bit you can see, you see the

1591
01:38:22,942 --> 01:38:28,572
gem is embedded in there with multiple metallic
and stone things keeping it suspended there.

1592
01:38:28,572 --> 01:38:33,053
LIAM: Can I inspect the chest of this creature
like it's a trap?

1593
01:38:33,053 --> 01:38:34,997
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1594
01:38:34,997 --> 01:38:37,519
LAURA: Can I see if the golem's wearing a
circlet?

1595
01:38:37,519 --> 01:38:39,297
LIAM: 20.

1596
01:38:39,297 --> 01:38:44,220
MATT: 20. Ah, well, he was up against its head,
there was no circlet on the golem. Looking at it,

1597
01:38:44,220 --> 01:38:48,560
I mean, there's no trap per se, it's part of the
construct of this construct.

1598
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:50,656
LIAM: What's it made of. Is it metal or stone?

1599
01:38:50,656 --> 01:38:51,691
MATT: Stone.

1600
01:38:51,691 --> 01:38:53,731
LIAM: Is there any way to open it? From the
front?

1601
01:38:53,731 --> 01:38:55,238
MATT: Not from what you can see, no.

1602
01:38:55,238 --> 01:38:56,771
LIAM: Okay.

1603
01:38:56,771 --> 01:38:59,397
SAM: Should I go upstairs and get Grog, just in
case things get ugly?

1604
01:38:59,397 --> 01:39:02,933
LIAM: I add a little pointy beard on the bottom of
his chin.

1605
01:39:02,933 --> 01:39:04,145
MATT: Okay.

1606
01:39:04,145 --> 01:39:06,313
LAURA: We should keep looking. Anybody else want
to look around the room for the circlet?

1607
01:39:06,313 --> 01:39:09,881
TALIESIN: I feel like this is not the only room.
This is not enough. I feel like there's--

1608
01:39:09,881 --> 01:39:12,400
MARISHA: Yeah, I start looking around to see if
there's hidden chambers,

1609
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:14,646
loose stones in the wall--

1610
01:39:14,646 --> 01:39:20,868
SAM: Keyleth, don't you have something that he
gave us?

1611
01:39:20,868 --> 01:39:29,571
MARISHA: Oh, that's true, the Hunk of Quall. I
pull out the Hunk of Quall.

1612
01:39:29,571 --> 01:39:39,519
MATT: Okay. Pull it out, hold it aloft, it begins
to glow a little bit and react. The golem's chest

1613
01:39:39,519 --> 01:39:50,321
glows a little bit and reacts. In a far distant
corner, underneath the alchemical table, in a pile

1614
01:39:50,321 --> 01:39:55,564
of some pieces of wood and crumpled stone, there's
a slight dull glow.

1615
01:39:55,564 --> 01:39:59,753
MARISHA: I walk over and I start brushing it
away.

1616
01:39:59,753 --> 01:40:06,256
MATT: Okay, you pull it away. You find an almost
full loop of metal.

1617
01:40:06,256 --> 01:40:09,923
MARISHA: Would it be a dark iron cobalt band?

1618
01:40:09,923 --> 01:40:11,476
MATT: Yeah, it is, actually.

1619
01:40:11,476 --> 01:40:14,358
TRAVIS: Thank god for that lump of Quall.

1620
01:40:14,358 --> 01:40:21,318
SAM: Oi, did she pick it up already?

1621
01:40:21,318 --> 01:40:22,119
MATT: Yeah.

1622
01:40:22,119 --> 01:40:23,184
SAM: Didn't kill us?

1623
01:40:23,184 --> 01:40:24,227
MATT: No.

1624
01:40:24,227 --> 01:40:27,296
SAM: Well, that's good. Did it wake up the beast?

1625
01:40:27,296 --> 01:40:34,311
MATT: No, the circlet's glow has faded. You have
it in your hand.

1626
01:40:34,311 --> 01:40:36,432
LAURA: Well. We have the thing.

1627
01:40:36,432 --> 01:40:42,626
TALIESIN: I'm going to quickly take a look at the
papers that were buried in--

1628
01:40:42,626 --> 01:40:55,227
MATT: A series of notes scribbled on the paper.
You can see a number of sketches of the construct

1629
01:40:55,227 --> 01:41:03,281
of the actual golem itself, pieces of its body and
its form, but some of it's been torn and crumpled

1630
01:41:03,281 --> 01:41:05,326
up, tossed aside, failed attempts.

1631
01:41:05,326 --> 01:41:07,601
TALIESIN: Failed attempts? Does he write his name
anywhere?

1632
01:41:07,601 --> 01:41:08,716
MATT: No.

1633
01:41:08,716 --> 01:41:09,954
TALIESIN: Damn.

1634
01:41:09,954 --> 01:41:17,251
MARISHA: I take off my very prized circlet that I
love oh so much.

1635
01:41:17,251 --> 01:41:18,560
MATT: Okay.

1636
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:20,761
MARISHA: Why'd you make that face?

1637
01:41:20,761 --> 01:41:24,689
MATT: No, nothing. What're you doing?

1638
01:41:24,689 --> 01:41:27,608
MARISHA: And I put the serpent circlet on.

1639
01:41:27,608 --> 01:41:28,762
MATT: Okay.

1640
01:41:28,762 --> 01:41:30,819
MARISHA: And I concentrate to see what it feels
like.

1641
01:41:30,819 --> 01:41:32,014
MATT: Okay.

1642
01:41:32,014 --> 01:41:35,629
MARISHA: And I hand my circlet to-- Don't break
it!

1643
01:41:35,629 --> 01:41:37,005
SAM: Of course I'm not going to break it!

1644
01:41:37,005 --> 01:41:38,126
MARISHA: It's a family heirloom.

1645
01:41:38,126 --> 01:41:39,911
SAM: I'll have Mort hold it. Mort!

1646
01:41:39,911 --> 01:41:47,027
MATT: So the circlet floats in the air, just out
of reach. Concentrate, as soon as you place it on

1647
01:41:47,027 --> 01:41:52,440
your head, it locks to the sides of your head and
you feel this cold probing into your mind

1648
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:53,759
for a moment.

1649
01:41:53,759 --> 01:41:56,639
TALIESIN: It's installing Windows.

1650
01:41:56,639 --> 01:41:59,334
MARISHA: Not Windows 10, not Windows 10, god damn
it!

1651
01:41:59,334 --> 01:42:04,997
(laughter)

1652
01:42:04,997 --> 01:42:07,926
TALIESIN: I'm so sorry.

1653
01:42:07,926 --> 01:42:14,577
LIAM: Into the corner. Face the corner for a
minute.

1654
01:42:14,577 --> 01:42:20,974
MATT: It's funny because it's relevant. All right.
So, you feel there is a connection trying to be

1655
01:42:20,974 --> 01:42:28,926
made, but you would need time to attune to this,
should you want to take the time to do so. 30

1656
01:42:28,926 --> 01:42:30,709
minutes to an hour, depending.

1657
01:42:30,709 --> 01:42:34,564
TALIESIN: Let's take all of this out of the house,
maybe.

1658
01:42:34,564 --> 01:42:36,450
LAURA: Including the golem?

1659
01:42:36,450 --> 01:42:43,018
MARISHA: I want to stay here and see. You guys
continue looking around. I'm going to meditate for

1660
01:42:43,018 --> 01:42:44,130
a second.

1661
01:42:44,130 --> 01:42:47,908
MATT: Grog, much time goes by. 20, 30 minutes. Not
a peep. Silence.

1662
01:42:47,908 --> 01:42:54,901
TRAVIS: Can I, since I'm bored-- I look up and
down the street. Anything suspicious?

1663
01:42:54,901 --> 01:43:04,472
MATT: I mean, a few folks wander by, looking
nervous around you. Make a perception check.

1664
01:43:04,472 --> 01:43:15,550
TRAVIS: Hey! Minus, no, plus one. No. (laughs)
Eightee-- wait.

1665
01:43:15,550 --> 01:43:17,965
(laughter)

1666
01:43:17,965 --> 01:43:19,322
TRAVIS: Zero. 19!

1667
01:43:19,322 --> 01:43:27,043
MATT: Okay. You do notice on the far end of the
street there does appear to be a pair of

1668
01:43:27,043 --> 01:43:29,784
individuals that are leaned against a building,
looking right at you.

1669
01:43:29,784 --> 01:43:33,400
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

1670
01:43:33,400 --> 01:43:37,533
MATT: They're about a block and a half down the
direction you came.

1671
01:43:37,533 --> 01:43:45,169
TRAVIS: I don't look at them. Can I try to attune
with my new bloodaxe while I'm waiting?

1672
01:43:45,169 --> 01:43:47,109
MATT: You can. Just the bloodaxe?

1673
01:43:47,109 --> 01:43:52,787
TRAVIS: Both.

1674
01:43:52,787 --> 01:43:58,193
MATT: Okay. So you sit down, your hands still
inside the gauntlets, and take a moment to find

1675
01:43:58,193 --> 01:44:04,830
the connection. You feel this rush of adrenaline
hit your body as your hands seem to go numb for a

1676
01:44:04,830 --> 01:44:11,730
moment, and in a flash your eyes see the chaos of
the elements, of the creation of planets slamming

1677
01:44:11,730 --> 01:44:19,356
into flames and earth, this instant vision of
the very force of creation, a time before

1678
01:44:19,356 --> 01:44:24,896
civilization, and you feel that fiery wrath all of
a sudden burn through your fingertips. The vision

1679
01:44:24,896 --> 01:44:28,589
ends and you look down, and as you curl your
fingers, strength pulses through your body that

1680
01:44:28,589 --> 01:44:35,296
you haven't understood in a while. As you're
coming over that moment, the bloodaxe solidifies

1681
01:44:35,296 --> 01:44:43,704
in your grip, and you can see where this rush
could definitely send Kevdak's head to get a

1682
01:44:43,704 --> 01:44:45,235
little big.

1683
01:44:45,235 --> 01:44:46,583
TRAVIS: Sweet.

1684
01:44:46,583 --> 01:44:49,353
TALIESIN: The power of Neil deGrasse Tyson is with
you.

1685
01:44:49,353 --> 01:44:53,077
(laughter)

1686
01:44:53,077 --> 01:44:56,252
LIAM: But you know, let's go kill the dragon
before we get the rest of these things, because

1687
01:44:56,252 --> 01:44:57,063
that's a good idea.

1688
01:44:57,063 --> 01:44:58,969
TALIESIN: Because that's going to be great. God.

1689
01:44:58,969 --> 01:45:02,603
MATT: So, you take the time and eventually the
connection finds its way and there's a clarity,

1690
01:45:02,603 --> 01:45:09,079
and you, as it hits you at the end of this restful
period in the basement, you open your eyes and you

1691
01:45:09,079 --> 01:45:18,071
feel-- it's hard to describe, a bit of coldness in
your head that's off to the right side of your

1692
01:45:18,071 --> 01:45:21,398
head. It's this slight tickle of cold.

1693
01:45:21,398 --> 01:45:23,707
LIAM: That's no fun.

1694
01:45:23,707 --> 01:45:27,727
MARISHA: Slight tickle of cold?

1695
01:45:27,727 --> 01:45:31,135
MATT: Right there, almost like inside your skull.

1696
01:45:31,135 --> 01:45:34,830
MARISHA: I concentrate on it.

1697
01:45:34,830 --> 01:45:36,489
MATT: Okay.

1698
01:45:36,489 --> 01:45:39,440
MARISHA: And I see if I can manifest the cold?

1699
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:46,007
MATT: Okay. You look down at your hands and try to
manifest the cold. Nothing happens.

1700
01:45:46,007 --> 01:45:48,931
MARISHA: I focus on the golem.

1701
01:45:48,931 --> 01:45:53,457
MATT: You turn to the golem, and as you turn, the
cold shifts to the front, in the direction

1702
01:45:53,457 --> 01:45:54,723
of the golem.

1703
01:45:54,723 --> 01:45:57,664
LAURA: Oh! Yeah yeah yeah.

1704
01:45:57,664 --> 01:46:10,476
MARISHA: I look at the golem, and I say, step
forward.

1705
01:46:10,476 --> 01:46:17,976
MATT: Suddenly, the eyes, which were dark, flare
with bright blue light, matching his chest--

1706
01:46:17,976 --> 01:46:20,190
LAURA: Oh shit, oh wait, his legs are tied up--

1707
01:46:20,190 --> 01:46:25,877
MATT: --and as he does, fwoomp, boom! Face-down
onto the ground, the rope coming taut, it slams

1708
01:46:25,877 --> 01:46:32,794
into the floor. You hear this loud impact beneath
the ground.

1709
01:46:32,794 --> 01:46:34,736
SAM: We're okay, we're okay.

1710
01:46:34,736 --> 01:46:40,960
LIAM: I swivel out a dagger and cut right below
the knot.

1711
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:43,477
LAURA: He looked like a moron. That was amazing.

1712
01:46:43,477 --> 01:46:45,193
MARISHA: And I go, sorry! Sorry!

1713
01:46:45,193 --> 01:46:47,466
MATT: No response. It's still face-down on the
ground.

1714
01:46:47,466 --> 01:46:49,077
LAURA: I'm on the ground laughing.

1715
01:46:49,077 --> 01:46:53,907
MARISHA: And I go, rise.

1716
01:46:53,907 --> 01:46:59,278
LIAM: Wait wait, one second, one second! We tied
it around a lot of times. Hold on!

1717
01:46:59,278 --> 01:47:04,831
MATT: As you're trying to cut the rope free, it
starts standing up. You finally pull away as its

1718
01:47:04,831 --> 01:47:12,494
foot backs up and almost crushes you. As it rights
itself and stands before you.

1719
01:47:12,494 --> 01:47:14,205
LIAM: Look at that mustache.

1720
01:47:14,205 --> 01:47:23,798
MATT: It has a majestic, black mustache across its
face, its glowing arcane-driven eye sockets and

1721
01:47:23,798 --> 01:47:29,187
its pulsing blue energy source in its chest,
stands looking down at you intently.

1722
01:47:29,187 --> 01:47:33,311
TALIESIN: I'm going to go diving to see if there's
an instruction manual somewhere in this room. I'm

1723
01:47:33,311 --> 01:47:35,228
on my hands and knees going through the papers.

1724
01:47:35,228 --> 01:47:40,814
MARISHA: I look at the rest of them and I go, holy
shit.

1725
01:47:40,814 --> 01:47:43,516
ASHLEY: Make him wave!

1726
01:47:43,516 --> 01:47:51,244
MARISHA: And I say, your manners. Wave to Pike.

1727
01:47:51,244 --> 01:47:57,532
ASHLEY: Keyleth, that's awesome!

1728
01:47:57,532 --> 01:48:05,301
MARISHA: And then I say, and a curtsey for Vex.

1729
01:48:05,301 --> 01:48:08,477
SAM: Oh, come on, don't demean him.

1730
01:48:08,477 --> 01:48:13,122
MARISHA: This is the coolest!

1731
01:48:13,122 --> 01:48:16,227
LIAM: Can it do a double-bird?

1732
01:48:16,227 --> 01:48:23,894
MARISHA: And I say, what do we say to those who we
have just vanquished?

1733
01:48:23,894 --> 01:48:34,336
MATT: Turns to Vax. Big ol' stony middle fingers
about that wide around.

1734
01:48:34,336 --> 01:48:39,926
MARISHA: And I look at him and I say, never forget
that.

1735
01:48:39,926 --> 01:48:42,471
SAM: He doesn't have a mind.

1736
01:48:42,471 --> 01:48:44,598
MARISHA: He has my mind.

1737
01:48:44,598 --> 01:48:47,835
LAURA: 21. What I rolled.

1738
01:48:47,835 --> 01:48:54,034
MATT: As you guys are scanning around the floor,
no sign of any sort of instruction manual, the way

1739
01:48:54,034 --> 01:48:57,733
that things have been pulled out of here, and the
way the circlet was found, you get the feeling as

1740
01:48:57,733 --> 01:49:04,615
you look about this place that in the escape,
Quall was grabbing and Drez Vina were grabbing

1741
01:49:04,615 --> 01:49:09,190
everything they could, and didn't realize until they
had left that the circlet had fallen from their

1742
01:49:09,190 --> 01:49:14,184
grasp and been left behind. Anything else they
probably have that is pertaining to this

1743
01:49:14,184 --> 01:49:15,340
experiment.

1744
01:49:15,340 --> 01:49:16,906
SAM: Well, we have a killing machine now.

1745
01:49:16,906 --> 01:49:19,392
LAURA: How do we get him out?

1746
01:49:19,392 --> 01:49:21,047
MARISHA: That's what I was just thinking.

1747
01:49:21,047 --> 01:49:24,895
SAM: Can only creatures go in your locket thing?

1748
01:49:24,895 --> 01:49:26,537
LAURA: I don't know.

1749
01:49:26,537 --> 01:49:29,292
SAM: Well, probably only creatures.

1750
01:49:29,292 --> 01:49:30,622
TALIESIN: There's only one way to find out.

1751
01:49:30,622 --> 01:49:44,388
LAURA: Okay, yeah, I pop Trinket out. It says a
creature no more than large in size.

1752
01:49:44,388 --> 01:49:47,997
MATT: He's a construct.

1753
01:49:47,997 --> 01:49:49,393
LAURA: So no?

1754
01:49:49,393 --> 01:49:51,207
MATT: Well, I mean, you'd have to try to find
out.

1755
01:49:51,207 --> 01:49:53,556
LAURA: I walk up. He's not going to hit me, is he,
Keyleth?

1756
01:49:53,556 --> 01:50:06,371
MARISHA: I'll tell him not to. I tell him, hey!
(whispers) What should I? Should I say his name?

1757
01:50:06,371 --> 01:50:07,837
Does he have a name?

1758
01:50:07,837 --> 01:50:09,010
LAURA: Spike!

1759
01:50:09,010 --> 01:50:13,539
MARISHA: I like it. Spike! Is he spikey at all?
He's bludgeony.

1760
01:50:13,539 --> 01:50:16,021
LAURA: I don't know, I just liked the name.

1761
01:50:16,021 --> 01:50:20,129
MARISHA: Okay, I ask him, are you called
something?

1762
01:50:20,129 --> 01:50:21,535
SAM: He doesn't have a mind.

1763
01:50:21,535 --> 01:50:22,726
LAURA: Can he talk?

1764
01:50:22,726 --> 01:50:24,341
MATT: There's no response.

1765
01:50:24,341 --> 01:50:27,400
SAM: Fassbender.

1766
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:31,298
MARISHA: (laughs) Fassbender? No.

1767
01:50:31,298 --> 01:50:32,830
LAURA: Why?

1768
01:50:32,830 --> 01:50:34,320
SAM: Too hunky?

1769
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:39,017
LAURA: Can he put his finger down, and I hold the
locket up. Hey, Fassbender.

1770
01:50:39,017 --> 01:50:43,878
MARISHA: Enter the locket, Fassbender.

1771
01:50:43,878 --> 01:50:48,631
MATT: Puts the finger out. Touches the locket.

1772
01:50:48,631 --> 01:50:50,738
SAM: Ahh, dammit.

1773
01:50:50,738 --> 01:50:55,248
LAURA: Nope. No luck.

1774
01:50:55,248 --> 01:50:58,714
MARISHA: Good work, Fassbender. I guess we walk
him out of here.

1775
01:50:58,714 --> 01:51:02,258
TALIESIN: Or cast a spell.

1776
01:51:02,258 --> 01:51:04,448
SAM: Oh, if only I had any.

1777
01:51:04,448 --> 01:51:07,683
TALIESIN: If only he had any spells.

1778
01:51:07,683 --> 01:51:11,586
MARISHA: What kind of a spell?

1779
01:51:11,586 --> 01:51:15,031
TRAVIS: What are you guys doing down there that is
so loud?

1780
01:51:15,031 --> 01:51:20,011
SAM: Sorry, we met somebody who's even stronger
and awesomer than you. But we still love you and

1781
01:51:20,011 --> 01:51:21,810
we'll bring him out to meet you soon.

1782
01:51:21,810 --> 01:51:26,912
TALIESIN: Keyleth has a pet giant robot. I don't
know what to make of this.

1783
01:51:26,912 --> 01:51:28,606
LIAM: A what?

1784
01:51:28,606 --> 01:51:31,769
TALIESIN: It's a thing I've been working on, but
apparently someone else has done it first, so

1785
01:51:31,769 --> 01:51:32,809
never mind.

1786
01:51:32,809 --> 01:51:34,171
MARISHA: It's a thing you've been working on?

1787
01:51:34,171 --> 01:51:35,893
TALIESIN: Never mind! I'm not working on it
anymore!

1788
01:51:35,893 --> 01:51:38,234
(laughter)

1789
01:51:38,234 --> 01:51:39,936
SAM: You can do a pocket fisherman instead.

1790
01:51:39,936 --> 01:51:41,607
TALIESIN: It's passé and stupid. I don't want to
hear about it.

1791
01:51:41,607 --> 01:51:48,541
MATT: So what's the plan?

1792
01:51:48,541 --> 01:51:50,770
MARISHA: I walk him out.

1793
01:51:50,770 --> 01:51:53,449
SAM: Wait! Oh no, he's not a creature. I can't
make him invisible.

1794
01:51:53,449 --> 01:51:57,891
MATT: I mean, he is a creature. Just the
particular enchantment based on this, you get the

1795
01:51:57,891 --> 01:52:02,652
sense that as part of the realm of the Raven Queen
is the living and the dead, and this is not

1796
01:52:02,652 --> 01:52:07,253
necessarily a living creature, it's a construct
and the magic does not have an effect on it.

1797
01:52:07,253 --> 01:52:08,727
SAM: Oh. Any magic.

1798
01:52:08,727 --> 01:52:10,095
MATT: That magic.

1799
01:52:10,095 --> 01:52:13,150
SAM: I could try to make him invisible.

1800
01:52:13,150 --> 01:52:15,008
LAURA: Oh, that's good!

1801
01:52:15,008 --> 01:52:17,493
SAM: It says creature.

1802
01:52:17,493 --> 01:52:25,455
MARISHA: Scanlan, do you have a circlet right now?
You had the Ioun stones. Do you have anything on

1803
01:52:25,455 --> 01:52:26,459
your head?

1804
01:52:26,459 --> 01:52:27,670
SAM: I am fully attuned.

1805
01:52:27,670 --> 01:52:29,113
MATT: Yeah, this requires attunement to wear.

1806
01:52:29,113 --> 01:52:34,532
LIAM: Keyleth, is this something you're going to
want to do in the long term?

1807
01:52:34,532 --> 01:52:46,152
MARISHA: Well, my circlet, I'm a bit attached to
it and it's very nice and has a lot of benefits to it.

1808
01:52:46,152 --> 01:52:49,449
LIAM: So if we're going to go to the trouble of
taking this thing out of here, one of us has to

1809
01:52:49,449 --> 01:52:52,646
use it. What about your Pom-pom, or-- what did you
call him?

1810
01:52:52,646 --> 01:52:57,879
ASHLEY: Pop-Pop? Pop-Pop could do it, but I don't
know if he would be very--

1811
01:52:57,879 --> 01:53:07,014
MARISHA: I can wield. I can use him. Honestly,
Fassbender might be something that we use

1812
01:53:07,014 --> 01:53:10,133
sometimes and not all the time anyway. Maybe?

1813
01:53:10,133 --> 01:53:13,542
TALIESIN: Could we get him into the Bag of
Holding?

1814
01:53:13,542 --> 01:53:14,787
LIAM: I doubt it.

1815
01:53:14,787 --> 01:53:16,344
MATT: Has to fit through the opening.

1816
01:53:16,344 --> 01:53:18,214
TALIESIN: Yeah. We don't have a big enough Bag of
Holding.

1817
01:53:18,214 --> 01:53:32,124
LIAM: Ooh, I have an invention idea. Could you
build a little gnome chair for either Scanlan or

1818
01:53:32,124 --> 01:53:35,190
Pike or Wilhand on the back of it?

1819
01:53:35,190 --> 01:53:36,931
LAURA: But I think he moves rather slow.

1820
01:53:36,931 --> 01:53:39,206
TALIESIN: Yes, it would be so Mad Max. It would be
beyond Thunderdome.

1821
01:53:39,206 --> 01:53:42,652
LIAM: I don't get that reference, but I think you
feel me.

1822
01:53:42,652 --> 01:53:45,598
LAURA: How fast can he run?

1823
01:53:45,598 --> 01:53:49,018
MARISHA: Well, let's try it, I guess.

1824
01:53:49,018 --> 01:53:53,464
TALIESIN: Perhaps let's try this somewhere that is
not a basement filled with chemicals.

1825
01:53:53,464 --> 01:53:56,879
SAM: We can try this in the mansion. If we can get
him through the door.

1826
01:53:56,879 --> 01:53:59,516
MARISHA: Let's make him invisible and get him to
the mansion.

1827
01:53:59,516 --> 01:54:01,918
SAM: I'll try to turn him invisible. I don't think
it'll work, though, but--

1828
01:54:01,918 --> 01:54:07,812
MATT: You cast the spell for a second, using your
bardic flair you wink and reach out and touch the

1829
01:54:07,812 --> 01:54:11,099
golem, and the golem's form vanishes.

1830
01:54:11,099 --> 01:54:16,932
SAM: Hey, that's great, all right, let's get outta
here then.

1831
01:54:16,932 --> 01:54:21,488
MATT: You tell it to follow?

1832
01:54:21,488 --> 01:54:24,483
MARISH: Let's see how this works. Follow.

1833
01:54:24,483 --> 01:54:26,394
MATT: (stomping)

1834
01:54:26,394 --> 01:54:27,586
LAURA: Well, he's rather loud.

1835
01:54:27,586 --> 01:54:31,027
MATT: As you guys come to the doorway and begin
stepping through, you watch as the doorframe goes

1836
01:54:31,027 --> 01:54:36,811
(breaking metal), and it's bent outward like
something bursting out of a tuna can.

1837
01:54:36,811 --> 01:54:39,306
(laughter)

1838
01:54:39,306 --> 01:54:45,717
MARISHA: Shit. Hey, Vex? Do you have a Pass
Without a Trace handy?

1839
01:54:45,717 --> 01:54:53,262
LAURA: Let me see how many spells I have left. I
think I do. Yeah, I can do Pass Without a Trace, I

1840
01:54:53,262 --> 01:54:54,498
have a couple left.

1841
01:54:54,498 --> 01:54:58,303
ASHLEY: I couldn't possibly use my Glove of
Storing, could I? To hold his hand?

1842
01:54:58,303 --> 01:55:05,322
MATT: You can try. You know from your experience
that the Glove of Storing is usually

1843
01:55:05,322 --> 01:55:06,990
for handheld objects.

1844
01:55:06,990 --> 01:55:08,793
ASHLEY: All right.

1845
01:55:08,793 --> 01:55:13,861
LAURA: I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on
all of us, including the golem.

1846
01:55:13,861 --> 01:55:14,711
MATT: Okay.

1847
01:55:14,711 --> 01:55:21,092
MARISHA: And I'm going to tell the golem to walk
quietly and stealth. Or attempt to, as best as he can.

1848
01:55:21,092 --> 01:55:28,541
MATT: (stomping) You guys make your way up the
stairs. As you make it up towards the top of the

1849
01:55:28,541 --> 01:55:32,838
stair landing, you hear the crashing of wood
behind you as the golem begins making its way up

1850
01:55:32,838 --> 01:55:34,498
the staircase, destroying it in the process.

1851
01:55:34,498 --> 01:55:36,929
MARISHA: (stammering) What? Why is it? No!

1852
01:55:36,929 --> 01:55:38,203
SAM: He's wider than the stairs.

1853
01:55:38,203 --> 01:55:39,413
MARISHA: Why is it going up the staircase?

1854
01:55:39,413 --> 01:55:40,500
SAM: Because we're going up the staircase!

1855
01:55:40,500 --> 01:55:43,803
MARISHA: Oh, we're going, oh. I thought we were
outside the front door.

1856
01:55:43,803 --> 01:55:49,608
MATT: No, this is all down in the basement. You
guys make your way up, as it tears through the

1857
01:55:49,608 --> 01:55:58,441
stairs. There is a stonework incline the stairs
are built on, so it just destroys the wood, but it

1858
01:55:58,441 --> 01:56:03,496
still manages to make its way up into the house
itself, breaking through the banister. You don't

1859
01:56:03,496 --> 01:56:09,835
even see it, you just see parts of the house (sounds of
destruction). It steps forward into the center of

1860
01:56:09,835 --> 01:56:14,608
the room on one of the plates that you had marked.
The thing goes (impact). And stops in the middle

1861
01:56:14,608 --> 01:56:18,277
of the air, before a couple smoke sparks go
(sparks).

1862
01:56:18,277 --> 01:56:19,842
LAURA: This thing is awesome.

1863
01:56:19,842 --> 01:56:23,139
MATT: Another one. (impacts)

1864
01:56:23,139 --> 01:56:26,814
LIAM: I feel like Quall didn't really think this
through.

1865
01:56:26,814 --> 01:56:36,003
SAM: Are you still unclear about whether we should
kill this dragon or not? We have a killing machine now!

1866
01:56:36,003 --> 01:56:37,250
LIAM: Does it fly?

1867
01:56:37,250 --> 01:56:40,148
SAM: It doesn't matter. He can catch it with his
hand!

1868
01:56:40,148 --> 01:56:43,315
LAURA: That's true. He actually might be able to
hold onto it. At least for a little bit.

1869
01:56:43,315 --> 01:56:50,563
MATT: The golem's about 12 feet tall, ten to 12.
The dragon's like 30 to 40.

1870
01:56:50,563 --> 01:56:51,722
SAM: Yeah, yeah!

1871
01:56:51,722 --> 01:56:53,996
LAURA: So the dragon could probably like fly away
with it.

1872
01:56:53,996 --> 01:56:58,590
TALIESIN: The dragon would find him a very
uncomfortable horse pill to swallow.

1873
01:56:58,590 --> 01:57:02,199
SAM: However, him plus a bunch of other people
could probably hold the dragon.

1874
01:57:02,199 --> 01:57:04,468
MARISHA: Let's get back to the mansion.

1875
01:57:04,468 --> 01:57:09,364
LAURA: Wait, can he get through the mansion door?

1876
01:57:09,364 --> 01:57:13,093
TALIESIN: We will tell him delicately to kneel and
crawl.

1877
01:57:13,093 --> 01:57:17,025
MARISHA: I mean, it's a magic door. Scanlan, can
you just make the door a little bigger to fit him?

1878
01:57:17,025 --> 01:57:20,314
SAM: Why don't we have him smash through it? Who
cares? We don't live here.

1879
01:57:20,314 --> 01:57:24,401
LIAM: We're talking about your mansion door.

1880
01:57:24,401 --> 01:57:31,261
MATT: You guys all look at Grog across the street,
sitting, clutching the bloodaxe, almost in a lotus

1881
01:57:31,261 --> 01:57:33,805
position, looking at it.

1882
01:57:33,805 --> 01:57:35,241
LIAM: Hey buddy, whatcha doing over there?

1883
01:57:35,241 --> 01:57:40,539
MATT: You guys glance up and see Grog smiling, as
suddenly behind them, (crashing), the doorway

1884
01:57:40,539 --> 01:57:47,802
blows out and wood gets thrown out in the middle
of the roadway, splintered ruin. There's a giant

1885
01:57:47,802 --> 01:57:52,248
dome shape of the front of the house where brick
and wood has been blown out.

1886
01:57:52,248 --> 01:57:58,228
TRAVIS: You guys, the door is exploding! Move!
This way! I race across the street to them with

1887
01:57:58,228 --> 01:57:59,536
the bloodaxe in my hands.

1888
01:57:59,536 --> 01:58:03,940
MATT: Okay, you get halfway across, pass them
before <i>whack</i>! Something hits you really hard in

1889
01:58:03,940 --> 01:58:07,609
the face, and you can already feel the blood
running in the back of your sinuses.

1890
01:58:07,609 --> 01:58:10,808
MARISHA: And I say, Grog, meet Fassbender.
Fassbender, Grog.

1891
01:58:10,808 --> 01:58:13,430
TRAVIS: I don't understand what you're telling me
right now.

1892
01:58:13,430 --> 01:58:18,527
MARISHA: He's invisible, but he's a giant stone
golem!

1893
01:58:18,527 --> 01:58:22,422
TRAVIS: Can I reach out with my hand and try and
touch whatever it was that smashed me in the face?

1894
01:58:22,422 --> 01:58:26,558
MATT: You reach out and there's a very solid
surface in front of you.

1895
01:58:26,558 --> 01:58:30,164
MARISHA: And I say, Fassbender, shake Grog's hand.
Remember, manners!

1896
01:58:30,164 --> 01:58:37,629
MATT: You reach up, as you're feeling out, all of
a sudden, a giant form grasps you from behind and

1897
01:58:37,629 --> 01:58:39,339
shakes your hand. Roll a strength check.

1898
01:58:39,339 --> 01:58:40,437
MARISHA: Ooh.

1899
01:58:40,437 --> 01:58:42,967
SAM: Your arm gets torn off.

1900
01:58:42,967 --> 01:58:44,185
LAURA: Oh god.

1901
01:58:44,185 --> 01:58:48,469
LIAM: Also, I lost a hitpoint when he flicked me
in the nuts. Nothing? Nothing.

1902
01:58:48,469 --> 01:58:51,237
TRAVIS: A new strength check, right? 19.

1903
01:58:51,237 --> 01:58:59,113
MATT: 19. As this invisible hand meets, the
strength is overwhelming, and then as you focus,

1904
01:58:59,113 --> 01:59:03,024
you take over the handshake and force it to move
your way.

1905
01:59:03,024 --> 01:59:05,483
SAM: Ooh, you're stronger than the thing!

1906
01:59:05,483 --> 01:59:07,127
MATT: You are stronger than it.

1907
01:59:07,127 --> 01:59:10,808
TRAVIS: What the fuck is grabbing my hand?

1908
01:59:10,808 --> 01:59:13,538
MARISHA: Fassbender. Scanlan named him.

1909
01:59:13,538 --> 01:59:15,942
TRAVIS: Yeah, you keep saying that word. I don't
know what it means.

1910
01:59:15,942 --> 01:59:20,211
LAURA: We'll show you what he looks like in the
mansion. I see you're wearing the gauntlets, Grog.

1911
01:59:20,211 --> 01:59:22,201
TRAVIS: Yeah, I've been wearing them.

1912
01:59:22,201 --> 01:59:26,012
ASHLEY: You've attuned to them.

1913
01:59:26,012 --> 01:59:28,306
TRAVIS: I did.

1914
01:59:28,306 --> 01:59:30,471
MARISHA: You have a nice glow about you.

1915
01:59:30,471 --> 01:59:34,769
SAM: You don't have hair up there.

1916
01:59:34,769 --> 01:59:49,962
MATT: As you guys make your way back towards the
classic Trickfoot estate with the somewhat muted

1917
01:59:49,962 --> 02:00:00,107
(stomping) behind you. The sun is just now
starting to hit the sunset period of the day. The

1918
02:00:00,107 --> 02:00:07,402
sky's going from a blue to a lighter white to an
orange color, dusk is upon you shortly. And with

1919
02:00:07,402 --> 02:00:08,751
that, we're going to take a bathroom break.

1920
02:00:08,751 --> 02:00:09,749
LAURA: Yay!

1921
02:00:09,749 --> 02:00:10,607
MARISHA: Bathroom break.

1922
02:00:10,607 --> 02:00:14,465
MATT: We'll be back here shortly, guys, once again
I want to say give some love to our Loot Crate

1923
02:00:14,465 --> 02:00:17,904
sponsors if you can, at the very least go check it
out and see what they got, go to

1924
02:00:17,904 --> 02:00:22,872
www.lootcrate.com/criticalrole. Even if you're not
interested in subscribing right now, go click on

1925
02:00:22,872 --> 02:00:27,126
the link and let them know that Critters have some
eyes and want to show them some love.

1926
02:00:27,126 --> 02:00:29,618
MARISHA: That Critters have power.

1927
02:00:29,618 --> 02:00:33,076
MATT: But yeah, guys, we'll see you back here in a
few minutes.

1928
02:00:33,076 --> 02:00:35,039
ALL: Woo!

1929
02:00:35,039 --> 02:13:23,303
[break]

1930
02:13:23,303 --> 02:13:30,666
MATT: Welcome back, everyone. So! Back from break,
Vox Machina made their way back to Wilhand's

1931
02:13:30,666 --> 02:13:41,818
estate, the Trickfoots. For the sake of brevity,
you did manage to get the Fassbender golem in

1932
02:13:41,818 --> 02:13:48,190
through the ten-foot-tall door, five-foot-wide
that leads into it. So it was able to barely

1933
02:13:48,190 --> 02:13:50,547
squeeze in if you wanted to leave it there for the
time being.

1934
02:13:50,547 --> 02:13:51,867
SAM: Absolutely.

1935
02:13:51,867 --> 02:13:54,413
MATT: Okay. There it fits into it.

1936
02:13:54,413 --> 02:13:56,899
MARISHA: I want to try some stuff.

1937
02:13:56,899 --> 02:13:57,985
MATT: What do you want to try?

1938
02:13:57,985 --> 02:14:02,398
MARISHA: Hang on, I'm tweeting out a link for Loot
Crate.

1939
02:14:02,398 --> 02:14:07,605
TRAVIS: I would like to go down to the training
area where I normally sleep. Pike! Would you come

1940
02:14:07,605 --> 02:14:08,711
with me?

1941
02:14:08,711 --> 02:14:13,861
ASHLEY: Yup. I want to train, too. Sit-ups.

1942
02:14:13,861 --> 02:14:17,556
MARISHA: How big is the training area, can we all
be in the training area practicing our skills?

1943
02:14:17,556 --> 02:14:19,536
MATT: Yeah, I mean, it's as big as he wants it to
be.

1944
02:14:19,536 --> 02:14:23,545
MARISHA: Yeah? Let's do that. Let's go practice.
Let's have a group training session, you guys!

1945
02:14:23,545 --> 02:14:25,393
ASHLEY: Are we learning skills? Group workout?

1946
02:14:25,393 --> 02:14:27,837
SAM: Wait, wait, before we go.

1947
02:14:27,837 --> 02:14:29,065
LAURA: What?

1948
02:14:29,065 --> 02:14:36,652
SAM: I want to go find my daughter. I've got to
leave. Sorry. Bye. Bye!

1949
02:14:36,652 --> 02:14:38,190
MARISHA: You're just leaving?

1950
02:14:38,190 --> 02:14:39,777
SAM: Yeah, I got to go. Sorry.

1951
02:14:39,777 --> 02:14:41,653
MARISHA: Just like that? We got to talk.

1952
02:14:41,653 --> 02:14:42,984
LAURA: Do you want help?

1953
02:14:42,984 --> 02:14:45,755
SAM: Yeah. I do. I'd like Vax to come.

1954
02:14:45,755 --> 02:14:50,213
LIAM: Sure, buddy, sure. Sure, yes, yeah. I'll see
you guys later.

1955
02:14:50,213 --> 02:14:51,925
TRAVIS: We'll wait for you here.

1956
02:14:51,925 --> 02:14:53,975
SAM: Talk, you can start the talk without me,
it'll be fast.

1957
02:14:53,975 --> 02:14:55,533
TRAVIS: Okay, you'll be right back.

1958
02:14:55,533 --> 02:14:58,980
LIAM: I'd like to throw in and say that I don't
want to fight the dragon tomorrow, all right,

1959
02:14:58,980 --> 02:14:59,928
let's go.

1960
02:14:59,928 --> 02:15:01,432
SAM: I do want to, and bye.

1961
02:15:01,432 --> 02:15:02,415
TRAVIS: Copy that.

1962
02:15:02,415 --> 02:15:03,631
MARISHA: We'll train while you guys go!

1963
02:15:03,631 --> 02:15:05,830
MATT: So where are you heading?

1964
02:15:05,830 --> 02:15:11,706
LIAM: Wait, wait. I run back to the door really
quick. Kiki, c'mere c'mere c'mere.

1965
02:15:11,706 --> 02:15:13,357
MARISHA: What what what?

1966
02:15:13,357 --> 02:15:22,713
LIAM: Can you do that mend-y thing still? This is
her, Pom-pom? Pop-Pop, I dunno. Glue the head back on.

1967
02:15:22,713 --> 02:15:24,325
MARISHA: Pop-Pop's? Okay okay okay.

1968
02:15:24,325 --> 02:15:27,228
LIAM: Yeah, glue the head back on. And then I
chase after Scanlan.

1969
02:15:27,228 --> 02:15:30,870
MARISHA: I do the mending on the Sarenrae statue.

1970
02:15:30,870 --> 02:15:39,518
MATT: And in doing so, you reaffirm the
single-piece form that was the small shrine setup

1971
02:15:39,518 --> 02:15:42,657
for the Sarenrae shrine in the home.

1972
02:15:42,657 --> 02:15:47,369
MARISHA: And I want to try a few tricks with the
golem, but throwing that out there. Go ahead.

1973
02:15:47,369 --> 02:15:49,393
MATT: We'll get to that in a moment. Where are you
going?

1974
02:15:49,393 --> 02:15:52,648
SAM: I'm going to where I dropped her off at the
sewers. And I'm hoping that he

1975
02:15:52,648 --> 02:15:54,437
can track or something?

1976
02:15:54,437 --> 02:15:58,172
LAURA: Probably should've brought a ranger with
you, I'm really good at tracking.

1977
02:15:58,172 --> 02:16:00,362
SAM: Fuck! I don't know what you people can do!

1978
02:16:00,362 --> 02:16:03,800
(laughter)

1979
02:16:03,800 --> 02:16:05,330
TRAVIS: Outstanding!

1980
02:16:05,330 --> 02:16:10,431
MATT: So, now as the sun is disappearing right
behind the mountains and nighttime is coming, you

1981
02:16:10,431 --> 02:16:22,937
lead Vax southward through Westruun, dodging
around a few patrolling goliath Herd members, and

1982
02:16:22,937 --> 02:16:27,850
eventually find your way to the alley where the
entrance to the sewer, the protruding entrance

1983
02:16:27,850 --> 02:16:32,740
existed where you left Dr. Dranzel and Kaylie and
a number of survivors that were in the ruined

1984
02:16:32,740 --> 02:16:34,257
Temple of Arathis.

1985
02:16:34,257 --> 02:16:39,081
SAM: Okay, Vax. I know that you are an expert
tracker. Right?

1986
02:16:39,081 --> 02:16:41,644
LIAM: I'm pretty good, I've watched my sister do
it.

1987
02:16:41,644 --> 02:16:43,327
SAM: Wait, you're not the one?

1988
02:16:43,327 --> 02:16:45,065
LIAM: You know that my name is Vax, right?

1989
02:16:45,065 --> 02:16:46,778
SAM: Yeah, I know, aren't you the tracker guy?

1990
02:16:46,778 --> 02:16:48,436
LIAM: Sort of?

1991
02:16:48,436 --> 02:16:51,021
SAM: I don't know, don't you move in the night and
do things?

1992
02:16:51,021 --> 02:16:53,342
LIAM: I do have really good eyes, do you want me
to have a look?

1993
02:16:53,342 --> 02:16:56,451
SAM: Can we go in the sewer and see if we can
figure out where they went?

1994
02:16:56,451 --> 02:16:57,602
LIAM: Let's have a look.

1995
02:16:57,602 --> 02:17:00,942
SAM: They went down here and they went towards the
city wall, that's all I know.

1996
02:17:00,942 --> 02:17:02,071
LIAM: Let's go.

1997
02:17:02,071 --> 02:17:02,941
SAM: Okay.

1998
02:17:02,941 --> 02:17:07,809
MATT: All right. Dranzel closed it behind him, you
go ahead and grab it. Make a strength check.

1999
02:17:07,809 --> 02:17:10,023
SAM: Well, I can't lift anything.

2000
02:17:10,023 --> 02:17:11,598
LIAM: Could we do it together, could I help him,
give him advantage?

2001
02:17:11,598 --> 02:17:12,748
SAM: Whoop! Natural 20.

2002
02:17:12,748 --> 02:17:14,431
(cheering)

2003
02:17:14,431 --> 02:17:17,763
MATT: We'll say between the two of you pulling,
Scanlan most of the weight, you manage to

2004
02:17:17,763 --> 02:17:19,587
(strained sounds).

2005
02:17:19,587 --> 02:17:21,144
SAM: C'mon, pull your weight, man!

2006
02:17:21,144 --> 02:17:25,327
MATT: Pull the grate, it scrapes, and you manage
to haul it off to the side. It's still a difficult

2007
02:17:25,327 --> 02:17:29,586
process but you do manage enough strength in the
two of you to pull it off.

2008
02:17:29,586 --> 02:17:31,753
LIAM: Your forearms are like Popeye,
motherfucker.

2009
02:17:31,753 --> 02:17:35,095
SAM: Yes they are. Years of use.

2010
02:17:35,095 --> 02:17:40,139
MATT: The stench of the sewer immediately hits
your nose, there is a metal ladder that leads down

2011
02:17:40,139 --> 02:17:41,995
into the subterranean area.

2012
02:17:41,995 --> 02:17:45,799
SAM: All right. Where do we go?

2013
02:17:45,799 --> 02:17:51,390
LIAM: I-- well, let's see if she left any-- my
sister looks for tracks. You really should've

2014
02:17:51,390 --> 02:17:53,288
brought my sister. I'm going to check for tracks.

2015
02:17:53,288 --> 02:17:54,581
MATT: Okay, make a survival check.

2016
02:17:54,581 --> 02:17:55,900
LIAM: Survival check, okay, well.

2017
02:17:55,900 --> 02:17:57,390
MATT: Oh wait no, is this for checking for traps
or tracking?

2018
02:17:57,390 --> 02:17:59,537
LIAM: Tracks. Footprints.

2019
02:17:59,537 --> 02:18:00,759
LAURA: Is that what you said?

2020
02:18:00,759 --> 02:18:04,039
LIAM: I said tracks, I'm not looking for traps,
we're in the sewer. Tracks.

2021
02:18:04,039 --> 02:18:05,300
MATT: Yes. Survival.

2022
02:18:05,300 --> 02:18:08,182
SAM: D'you need an article of her clothing for a
scent?

2023
02:18:08,182 --> 02:18:10,736
LIAM: 17. I'm concentrating on the mud.

2024
02:18:10,736 --> 02:18:18,501
MATT: As you're down inside the sewer, there is a
recess in the center of the floor where most of

2025
02:18:18,501 --> 02:18:27,418
the various sludge runs through. There are bits of
runoff from when the rain does pour through, and

2026
02:18:27,418 --> 02:18:34,298
it rains fairly often here in this part of
Tal'Dorei, where bits of mud and compost that get

2027
02:18:34,298 --> 02:18:41,991
caught on the sides are. You do manage to find a
few spots that appear like footsteps, you don't

2028
02:18:41,991 --> 02:18:45,409
know who from, it appears some sort of humanoid's
footsteps, over an area that heads southward.

2029
02:18:45,409 --> 02:18:48,699
LIAM: I hold my foot over one, is it smaller than
mine or is it about the same size?

2030
02:18:48,699 --> 02:18:50,347
MATT: The one you see is about the same size.

2031
02:18:50,347 --> 02:18:54,485
SAM: There were some humanoids, humans with us. We
were traveling with a bunch of people.

2032
02:18:54,485 --> 02:18:59,819
LIAM: Yeah? Okay. Well, I mean, they would've
washed away if they were old, so probably pretty

2033
02:18:59,819 --> 02:19:01,897
new. Let's follow them.

2034
02:19:01,897 --> 02:19:03,468
SAM: You are the expert.

2035
02:19:03,468 --> 02:19:04,865
LIAM: I clearly am.

2036
02:19:04,865 --> 02:19:06,018
(laughter)

2037
02:19:06,018 --> 02:19:07,197
LIAM: Let's go.

2038
02:19:07,197 --> 02:19:08,258
SAM: Shit.

2039
02:19:08,258 --> 02:19:11,346
LIAM: Yeah, I'll lead the way.

2040
02:19:11,346 --> 02:19:15,086
MATT: Okay. You continue, both of you guys make
stealth checks.

2041
02:19:15,086 --> 02:19:16,390
LIAM: Yeah, okay.

2042
02:19:16,390 --> 02:19:21,909
SAM: Seven. I'm just excited!

2043
02:19:21,909 --> 02:19:25,587
TRAVIS: Going to see my daughter!

2044
02:19:25,587 --> 02:19:26,863
LIAM: 33.

2045
02:19:26,863 --> 02:19:35,837
MATT: Okay. You guys continue finding your way,
weaving through the southern area, following the

2046
02:19:35,837 --> 02:19:39,600
tracks they vanish and you'll see a couple
footprints here, and then you guys will lose the

2047
02:19:39,600 --> 02:19:45,665
trail. The scent is terrifying and getting worse
the further south you progress. You do head into

2048
02:19:45,665 --> 02:19:48,741
one central chamber and both of you guys make
perception checks.

2049
02:19:48,741 --> 02:19:51,984
SAM: Huh! 19!

2050
02:19:51,984 --> 02:19:55,341
LIAM: 30.

2051
02:19:55,341 --> 02:19:56,800
SAM: Okay.

2052
02:19:56,800 --> 02:20:03,598
MATT: You both stop in as you immediately see in
the center of this room a large bulbous form that

2053
02:20:03,598 --> 02:20:07,588
is massed in the center. You both stop.

2054
02:20:07,588 --> 02:20:09,793
LIAM: Qu-iet. Quiet.

2055
02:20:09,793 --> 02:20:10,961
SAM: I'm always quiet!

2056
02:20:10,961 --> 02:20:12,395
MATT: It is not moving.

2057
02:20:12,395 --> 02:20:13,499
SAM: Oh. Okay.

2058
02:20:13,499 --> 02:20:19,942
LAURA: Oh my god, did you send your daughter down
to get attacked by a giant bulbous shit?

2059
02:20:19,942 --> 02:20:21,933
SAM: Can we go around it?

2060
02:20:21,933 --> 02:20:25,592
MARISHA: It's true, there were like a bunch of
slimes and stuff down there.

2061
02:20:25,592 --> 02:20:27,884
LIAM: So we're in a larger chamber and it's in the
middle?

2062
02:20:27,884 --> 02:20:33,032
MATT: Yeah, it's like a four-way, four different
platforms or passages merge in the center here,

2063
02:20:33,032 --> 02:20:35,204
where one of the drains leads down into--

2064
02:20:35,204 --> 02:20:38,749
LIAM: And are there any of the footprints left
anywhere?

2065
02:20:38,749 --> 02:20:42,939
MATT: I mean, you do see bits of sludge around,
and there are a number of footprints that are all

2066
02:20:42,939 --> 02:20:46,181
scattered around, some smeared, some skidding.

2067
02:20:46,181 --> 02:20:56,432
LIAM: I reach down and I scoop Scanlan up in
football pose again. Which way do you want to go?

2068
02:20:56,432 --> 02:21:02,728
I can't tell which way. Your daughter. Reach deep,
man.

2069
02:21:02,728 --> 02:21:11,148
SAM: Can I sense which direction the wall of city
is, like do I have any sort of--

2070
02:21:11,148 --> 02:21:12,694
MATT: Make a survival check.

2071
02:21:12,694 --> 02:21:16,054
SAM: Survival, I've never done this before! 13.

2072
02:21:16,054 --> 02:21:24,285
MATT: 13. Keeping track of where you were and the
direction, you gather it's probably that way.

2073
02:21:24,285 --> 02:21:26,107
SAM: Oh! I-- let's go that way!

2074
02:21:26,107 --> 02:21:26,929
LIAM: Shh!

2075
02:21:26,929 --> 02:21:28,400
SAM: (whispering) Sorry, let's go that way.

2076
02:21:28,400 --> 02:21:30,660
LIAM: Don't. Move.

2077
02:21:30,660 --> 02:21:32,312
SAM: All right.

2078
02:21:32,312 --> 02:21:42,897
MATT: As you carefully move past, you look and you
see-- you did encounter one of these entities

2079
02:21:42,897 --> 02:21:51,759
before, when you were tracking down the rakshasa.
It's a terrible swollen creature with tendrils, a

2080
02:21:51,759 --> 02:22:01,178
mouth, it feeds on refuse and rot. This was a
rather swollen and dangerous-looking one. However,

2081
02:22:01,178 --> 02:22:07,247
as you pass by and look, you see a series of
wounds across its body and its lifeblood dripping

2082
02:22:07,247 --> 02:22:09,124
out. This one has been slain.

2083
02:22:09,124 --> 02:22:16,414
LIAM: I'm going to set you down, all right? I
think your daughter done killed a--

2084
02:22:16,414 --> 02:22:17,486
oogedyboogedy.

2085
02:22:17,486 --> 02:22:19,047
SAM: What? How do you know that?

2086
02:22:19,047 --> 02:22:20,455
LIAM: Sit down. It's dead.

2087
02:22:20,455 --> 02:22:21,802
SAM: Oh. Oh, good!

2088
02:22:21,802 --> 02:22:26,169
MATT: Survival check again. You followed the
tracks.

2089
02:22:26,169 --> 02:22:27,783
TRAVIS: Are there any track marks?

2090
02:22:27,783 --> 02:22:30,320
LIAM: 12. I already asked that.

2091
02:22:30,320 --> 02:22:36,581
MATT: The tracks vanish, you're not sure how to
follow a direction.

2092
02:22:36,581 --> 02:22:39,848
LIAM: Is there any blood or ooze walking away, I
mean dripping away from there?

2093
02:22:39,848 --> 02:22:44,808
MATT: I mean, it all congeals in this general
area, most of the central room, the middle area is

2094
02:22:44,808 --> 02:22:49,633
very clustered with slime and goop. There's no
natural flow and there hasn't been a very recent

2095
02:22:49,633 --> 02:22:53,397
rainfall so there isn't a fresh flow of water
through here either.

2096
02:22:53,397 --> 02:22:56,211
LIAM: And where were they going, where did you
tell them to go?

2097
02:22:56,211 --> 02:22:57,886
SAM: Out of town, get out of town.

2098
02:22:57,886 --> 02:23:01,048
LIAM: Do I know where that is, which direction
that is down here?

2099
02:23:01,048 --> 02:23:03,921
MATT: I mean, based on where you're going, you
guys can follow that path. And we'll say for the

2100
02:23:03,921 --> 02:23:11,759
sake of brevity you eventually find your way to a
portion of the sewer, dodging a few shady-looking

2101
02:23:11,759 --> 02:23:17,985
areas to where a final grate leads out into the
night. Because it is night at this point in time.

2102
02:23:17,985 --> 02:23:27,700
It's a large ten-foot-tall circular grate. If you
look, the bars are actually bent open and it leads

2103
02:23:27,700 --> 02:23:33,233
outward, the liquid from the sewage now spills out
into this small ravine in the very southern

2104
02:23:33,233 --> 02:23:36,209
portion of Westruun. And leads out into--

2105
02:23:36,209 --> 02:23:38,513
LIAM: Sort of like this? Or is it?

2106
02:23:38,513 --> 02:23:39,911
MATT: No, it's up like this, it's vertical.

2107
02:23:39,911 --> 02:23:42,863
LIAM: Vertical. And what do we see past the bars?

2108
02:23:42,863 --> 02:23:45,396
MATT: You see the open plains south of Westruun.

2109
02:23:45,396 --> 02:23:49,927
SAM: No sign of tracks, anyone huddled for
safety?

2110
02:23:49,927 --> 02:23:55,264
MATT: I mean, looking around you can see a few
footprints, scattered footprints, you can make a

2111
02:23:55,264 --> 02:23:58,157
survival check.

2112
02:23:58,157 --> 02:23:59,776
SAM: Pff. Ten.

2113
02:23:59,776 --> 02:24:00,782
LIAM: 12.

2114
02:24:00,782 --> 02:24:02,668
MATT: Ten? Nothing that specifically catches your
attention.

2115
02:24:02,668 --> 02:24:04,731
LIAM: I think she got outta here, pal.

2116
02:24:04,731 --> 02:24:06,492
SAM: Balls.

2117
02:24:06,492 --> 02:24:08,566
LIAM: But she's not here.

2118
02:24:08,566 --> 02:24:10,812
SAM: That's true.

2119
02:24:10,812 --> 02:24:11,980
LIAM: She's better off.

2120
02:24:11,980 --> 02:24:18,347
SAM: All right. All right. Sorry, wild goose
chase.

2121
02:24:18,347 --> 02:24:22,369
LIAM: No, no, don't worry about it. You want to
talk about it?

2122
02:24:22,369 --> 02:24:34,298
SAM: No, no. I just don't know when I'll see her
again, so. I'll find her again. That's all. It'll

2123
02:24:34,298 --> 02:24:35,526
be good.

2124
02:24:35,526 --> 02:24:37,005
LIAM: I believe that, too.

2125
02:24:37,005 --> 02:24:50,009
SAM: Yeah. Oh, and hey. Thank you. Back at the
sphinx. Your sister was unconscious, and you dove

2126
02:24:50,009 --> 02:24:56,821
in to save me. That was very nice.

2127
02:24:56,821 --> 02:25:04,057
LIAM: I knew she would be taken care of, and I
wasn't sure about you.

2128
02:25:04,057 --> 02:25:08,018
SAM: Because you love me?

2129
02:25:08,018 --> 02:25:15,214
LIAM: You're very entertaining and I would be sad
to see you go.

2130
02:25:15,214 --> 02:25:26,216
SAM: Well, I owe you one. Forever. And I hate to
say it, but I feel terrible about it, but I think

2131
02:25:26,216 --> 02:25:32,728
I might've killed a couple of civilians because I
feel like I owe you some, some help.

2132
02:25:32,728 --> 02:25:36,220
LIAM: What do you mean?

2133
02:25:36,220 --> 02:25:44,961
SAM: Well, I was in the big fight back there, I
could've hurt you or the civilians, but I decided

2134
02:25:44,961 --> 02:25:51,497
to hurt the civilians, because I've got to protect
you, because you protected me.

2135
02:25:51,497 --> 02:26:02,793
LIAM: Well-- there's no right or wrong, but next
time, I'll be all right. You help people more in

2136
02:26:02,793 --> 02:26:04,770
need than me, and I'll be all right.

2137
02:26:04,770 --> 02:26:06,904
SAM: All right. Next time.

2138
02:26:06,904 --> 02:26:11,852
LIAM: I don't know any of your fancy, you know,
fluh-duh-duh. But--

2139
02:26:11,852 --> 02:26:13,611
SAM: Well, I'm no ranger like you.

2140
02:26:13,611 --> 02:26:14,812
(laughter)

2141
02:26:14,812 --> 02:26:21,924
LIAM: There is no ranger like me. This is stupid,
we should go back.

2142
02:26:21,924 --> 02:26:23,753
SAM: Through the sewers again?

2143
02:26:23,753 --> 02:26:31,001
LIAM: Yeah. I mean, we don't have Big Man with us
and I don't want to run into any of his third

2144
02:26:31,001 --> 02:26:32,789
cousins or whatever, so yeah.

2145
02:26:32,789 --> 02:26:35,643
SAM: All right. I'll lead the way.

2146
02:26:35,643 --> 02:26:37,155
LIAM: Might as well.

2147
02:26:37,155 --> 02:26:39,812
MATT: Eventually you guys make your way back.

2148
02:26:39,812 --> 02:26:41,643
TALIESIN: Not going to make them roll survival to
get back?

2149
02:26:41,643 --> 02:26:43,910
LAURA: You guys are lost forever in the sewers.

2150
02:26:43,910 --> 02:26:47,545
MATT: Little roundabout, but they get there
eventually, they return to the mansion--

2151
02:26:47,545 --> 02:26:50,607
MARISHA: Status gained: fall into a pile of shit.
Never to get out.

2152
02:26:50,607 --> 02:26:59,184
MATT: Smelling awful. All right, so. You wanted to go
ahead and do some exercises with Fassbender.

2153
02:26:59,184 --> 02:27:01,760
MARISHA: I do want to do some exercises with
Fassbender.

2154
02:27:01,760 --> 02:27:03,343
LAURA: (laughs) Who doesn't?

2155
02:27:03,343 --> 02:27:07,726
MARISHA: Who doesn't want to do exercises with
Fassbender? Abs of stone, that Fassbender.

2156
02:27:07,726 --> 02:27:09,363
LIAM: P90X with Fassbender?

2157
02:27:09,363 --> 02:27:11,219
(laughter)

2158
02:27:11,219 --> 02:27:15,893
MARISHA: Okay, he's not invisible anymore, right?
You dropped that, I'm assuming he dropped-- sure.

2159
02:27:15,893 --> 02:27:17,371
MATT: That's faded by now, yeah.

2160
02:27:17,371 --> 02:27:29,959
TRAVIS: Ohh. I get it. Makes so much sense. Shit.
He is huge. Fuck. Now I get it, all right, he's

2161
02:27:29,959 --> 02:27:31,221
with us. Got it.

2162
02:27:31,221 --> 02:27:32,423
MARISHA: He is with us, yeah.

2163
02:27:32,423 --> 02:27:33,432
TRAVIS: Understand.

2164
02:27:33,432 --> 02:27:37,179
MARISHA: Oh, yeah, oh, sorry. Grog, Fassbender.
Fassbender, Grog.

2165
02:27:37,179 --> 02:27:38,697
TRAVIS: His name is Fassbender?

2166
02:27:38,697 --> 02:27:40,023
ASHLEY: I call him Fluffy.

2167
02:27:40,023 --> 02:27:41,846
TRAVIS: Fluffy it is!

2168
02:27:41,846 --> 02:27:46,778
MARISHA: I'm terrible at naming things, I just go
with whatever the first person shouts out.

2169
02:27:46,778 --> 02:27:48,742
LAURA: That's a lie because I said Spike.

2170
02:27:48,742 --> 02:27:53,228
MARISHA: Oh, you did say Spike. We overruled it
with Fassbender.

2171
02:27:53,228 --> 02:27:54,969
(laughter)

2172
02:27:54,969 --> 02:27:57,232
TALIESIN: She goes with the second thing that
everybody shouts out.

2173
02:27:57,232 --> 02:28:01,320
MATT: Too late now. It's in stone.

2174
02:28:01,320 --> 02:28:03,319
TALIESIN: Literally.

2175
02:28:03,319 --> 02:28:06,615
LIAM: It's like an improv show. "Salty
McFucknuts!"

2176
02:28:06,615 --> 02:28:08,763
(laughter)

2177
02:28:08,763 --> 02:28:10,555
MARISHA: Spike, ehhh, not that one.

2178
02:28:10,555 --> 02:28:13,372
MATT: It basically is, yeah.

2179
02:28:13,372 --> 02:28:28,186
MARISHA: Okay, so first I say, Fassbender, run!
And I want to see how fast he can go.

2180
02:28:28,186 --> 02:28:34,205
MATT: And he runs about the same speed you do, I
mean as far as its bigger steps, but it gets about

2181
02:28:34,205 --> 02:28:35,474
the same distance.

2182
02:28:35,474 --> 02:28:43,018
MARISHA: Okay, and I say, Fassbender, punch Grog!
He's used to this, Grog's fine with it.

2183
02:28:43,018 --> 02:28:44,228
MATT: Do you do anything?

2184
02:28:44,228 --> 02:28:45,801
TRAVIS: No, yeah, I totally take it.

2185
02:28:45,801 --> 02:28:48,252
MARISHA: This is how we train with Grog. It's
fine.

2186
02:28:48,252 --> 02:28:50,447
LAURA: You're healed, you're healed up?

2187
02:28:50,447 --> 02:28:51,883
TRAVIS: Enough.

2188
02:28:51,883 --> 02:28:57,856
MATT: The golem pulls back, whoosh, swings at you
with a giant fist. That is a 19.

2189
02:28:57,856 --> 02:29:06,682
TRAVIS: Yeah, that-- wait. Well, I took off--
yeah, I did take off my Bracers of Defense, so

2190
02:29:06,682 --> 02:29:08,985
that hits.

2191
02:29:08,985 --> 02:29:21,460
MATT: All right. Whack. Right square to the side
of the face and jaw, you take, from the impact of

2192
02:29:21,460 --> 02:29:30,421
its giant battering-ram-like arm, 24 points of
bludgeoning damage.

2193
02:29:30,421 --> 02:29:32,166
ALL: Oh!

2194
02:29:32,166 --> 02:29:33,915
MATT: You're not raging, so it's not halved.

2195
02:29:33,915 --> 02:29:38,759
TRAVIS: Okay. Tit for tat, bitch. And I swing back
with the Titanstone Knuckles and punch Fassbender

2196
02:29:38,759 --> 02:29:39,899
in the face.

2197
02:29:39,899 --> 02:29:41,193
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll for an attack.

2198
02:29:41,193 --> 02:29:44,407
LAURA: Do we know if we can heal him once we
damage him?

2199
02:29:44,407 --> 02:29:45,548
MARISHA: We'll find out.

2200
02:29:45,548 --> 02:29:47,559
TRAVIS: 28.

2201
02:29:47,559 --> 02:29:56,778
MATT: That hits. So you do one plus the plus seven
strength damage to it. So eight points of--

2202
02:29:56,778 --> 02:29:59,864
TRAVIS: Of the four or the six, because it's my
fist?

2203
02:29:59,864 --> 02:30:03,873
MATT: Huh? Well, it's not a save, your fists for
this because you're not a tavern brawler and we're

2204
02:30:03,941 --> 02:30:08,409
saying because you're not like on even ground with
the other guy. You're doing boom, one point of

2205
02:30:08,409 --> 02:30:14,852
damage from the punch plus seven for the strength.
So eight points of damage from the crack as the

2206
02:30:14,852 --> 02:30:21,075
fist hits. It does cause like a crack where the
impact hits, a little bit.

2207
02:30:21,075 --> 02:30:24,406
MARISHA: I say, okay, all right, enough hitting
each other, enough of that.

2208
02:30:24,406 --> 02:30:28,971
TRAVIS: Well, hold on, we were just getting warmed
up, I mean, this is where the game starts, you

2209
02:30:28,971 --> 02:30:32,119
know, it's like, P-I-N-G and then you really start
playing.

2210
02:30:32,119 --> 02:30:33,964
LAURA: Ping? You can--

2211
02:30:33,964 --> 02:30:35,698
TRAVIS: It's a song.

2212
02:30:35,698 --> 02:30:45,497
MARISHA: There's some other questions first, other
questions first. I cast Call Lightning.

2213
02:30:45,581 --> 02:30:47,080
MATT: Okay.

2214
02:30:47,080 --> 02:30:50,521
TALIESIN: I'm going to get in the way of this,
just for fun.

2215
02:30:50,521 --> 02:30:52,286
SAM: Indoors, by the way.

2216
02:30:52,286 --> 02:30:56,717
MARISHA: And I just, it's fine, I bring down a
bolt of lightning on a dummy, and then see if I

2217
02:30:56,717 --> 02:31:03,341
can also command Fassbender to punch a dummy.

2218
02:31:03,341 --> 02:31:10,002
MATT: Okay. Bolt of lightning hits a dummy, the
dummy is shattered. As you command Fassbender,

2219
02:31:10,002 --> 02:31:14,635
Fassbender leaps forward at another dummy, whoosh,
giant haymaker and causes the dummy to explode

2220
02:31:14,635 --> 02:31:17,245
into a bunch of fluff and cloth.

2221
02:31:17,245 --> 02:31:20,064
MARISHA: So would we say that would be like a
bonus action, what I just did?

2222
02:31:20,064 --> 02:31:21,436
MATT: No.

2223
02:31:21,436 --> 02:31:24,090
MARISHA: No? It was an action for each?

2224
02:31:24,090 --> 02:31:30,366
MATT: I mean, you have to focus on it, yeah. I
mean, you can give it-- you have an action to

2225
02:31:30,366 --> 02:31:32,616
give it a command, and it'll continue the command
as it goes.

2226
02:31:32,616 --> 02:31:36,890
TALIESIN: So once it's set in that motion, it'll
continue to kill that thing.

2227
02:31:36,890 --> 02:31:44,511
MARISHA: Okay. So then theoretically I can have a
concentration spell up and be like, kill that

2228
02:31:44,511 --> 02:31:46,471
thing, and they won't overlap?

2229
02:31:46,471 --> 02:31:48,074
MATT: Hmm, let's see.

2230
02:31:48,074 --> 02:31:51,446
LIAM: Y'know, while he looks that up, let me point
out that when I punched Percy in the face, there

2231
02:31:51,446 --> 02:31:53,175
were zero points of hitpoint damage.

2232
02:31:53,175 --> 02:31:55,579
(laughter)

2233
02:31:55,579 --> 02:31:57,739
SAM: Hey now. Rangers aren't very strong.

2234
02:31:57,739 --> 02:32:00,243
LIAM: Yes, yes, I did punch him.

2235
02:32:00,243 --> 02:32:05,305
TALIESIN: I want to check by the way, Liam, are
you imagining the eighties-era X-Men danger room

2236
02:32:05,305 --> 02:32:07,438
right now too, with like the hoops and the bars.

2237
02:32:07,438 --> 02:32:09,228
ALL: Ohh!

2238
02:32:09,228 --> 02:32:12,728
LIAM: Yeah, metal rods, and Nightcrawler going--

2239
02:32:12,728 --> 02:32:17,562
MATT: It takes an action to focus and give it a
new command.

2240
02:32:17,562 --> 02:32:18,981
MARISHA: A new command.

2241
02:32:18,981 --> 02:32:23,250
MATT: Yes. Once it is commanded, it will continue
to do it until told otherwise or it completes

2242
02:32:23,250 --> 02:32:25,297
whatever task it was given.

2243
02:32:25,297 --> 02:32:30,675
MARISHA: It's not a concentration to keep up that
command. So, like-- keep fighting the dragon until

2244
02:32:30,675 --> 02:32:34,714
it hits the ground would theoretically be one
command that would keep going?

2245
02:32:34,714 --> 02:32:37,132
MATT: Based on your experience with it so far,
theoretically it should work.

2246
02:32:37,132 --> 02:32:38,424
MARISHA: Okay.

2247
02:32:38,424 --> 02:32:40,665
LIAM: (robotic voice) Whatever Keyleth wants,
Keyleth gets.

2248
02:32:40,665 --> 02:32:46,740
MARISHA: Thank you, Speak and Spell. We found out
if it can talk?

2249
02:32:46,740 --> 02:32:48,374
TALIESIN: Ask a question.

2250
02:32:48,374 --> 02:32:49,659
MARISHA: Fassbender.

2251
02:32:49,659 --> 02:32:52,555
(laughter)

2252
02:32:52,555 --> 02:33:02,031
MARISHA: Fassbender. How many years old are you?
Hold up-- hold on, how old are you?

2253
02:33:02,031 --> 02:33:05,025
MATT: No response.

2254
02:33:05,025 --> 02:33:06,977
TALIESIN: All right, this is good, we're finding
out its intelligence level.

2255
02:33:06,977 --> 02:33:15,392
MARISHA: Can you gesture to me with your fingers
and tell me how many years old you are?

2256
02:33:15,392 --> 02:33:17,008
(whispers) I don't think he's listening.

2257
02:33:17,008 --> 02:33:18,666
TALIESIN: It may not be smart enough to know
that.

2258
02:33:18,666 --> 02:33:19,717
MARISHA: He's distracted.

2259
02:33:19,717 --> 02:33:24,615
MATT: Yeah, there, it's-- no response.

2260
02:33:24,615 --> 02:33:30,660
TALIESIN: So it doesn't know anything, that's
good. Let's find out if it can, does it have any

2261
02:33:30,660 --> 02:33:36,910
magical properties beyond punching, can it, tell
it to use magic.

2262
02:33:36,910 --> 02:33:46,244
MARISHA: Okay. Hey, Fassbender. Cast a spell on
Percy.

2263
02:33:46,244 --> 02:33:50,395
(laughter)

2264
02:33:50,395 --> 02:33:52,074
SAM: Death's eye.

2265
02:33:52,074 --> 02:33:53,782
TALIESIN: And then I die.

2266
02:33:53,782 --> 02:33:56,059
LIAM: Disintegrate beam, straight on.

2267
02:33:56,059 --> 02:33:58,618
TALIESIN: And then you dye a blue streak in your
hair and everything goes fine.

2268
02:33:58,618 --> 02:34:04,939
MATT: It turns over, brings its hands up like
this-- make a wisdom saving throw.

2269
02:34:04,939 --> 02:34:06,583
SAM: Oh my god.

2270
02:34:06,583 --> 02:34:09,984
MARISHA: Well look, I wanted a live test subject.

2271
02:34:09,984 --> 02:34:11,727
TALIESIN: No, no, I'm with you, I'm with you.

2272
02:34:11,727 --> 02:34:13,989
TRAVIS: That's my designation.

2273
02:34:13,989 --> 02:34:16,234
TALIESIN: Natural. One.

2274
02:34:16,234 --> 02:34:17,853
LAURA: Oh no!

2275
02:34:17,853 --> 02:34:20,174
MATT: (laughs) You feel like--

2276
02:34:20,174 --> 02:34:21,648
MARISHA: Hey! To Percy!

2277
02:34:21,648 --> 02:34:23,062
TALIESIN: No no no, it's happening.

2278
02:34:23,062 --> 02:34:26,655
MATT: You've been near explosions before, not like
super close but big enough where you feel like the

2279
02:34:26,655 --> 02:34:32,680
concussive wave from a distance, not enough to
harm you, but enough to like, send you off your

2280
02:34:32,680 --> 02:34:37,279
balance for a moment. You feel that impact, and as
you fall onto your back foot, time around you

2281
02:34:37,279 --> 02:34:43,174
seems to be moving faster that you'd expect, and
(slow-mo voice) you find your motion sluggish.

2282
02:34:43,174 --> 02:34:44,939
SAM: Oh. That's Slow.

2283
02:34:44,939 --> 02:34:49,145
MATT: (slow-mo voice) And you really have a hard
time really moving--

2284
02:34:49,145 --> 02:34:50,889
MARISHA: That's awesome!

2285
02:34:50,889 --> 02:34:54,161
TALIESIN: (slow-mo voice) This-- put--

2286
02:34:54,161 --> 02:34:55,574
ASHLEY: It's-- you're in slow-mo!

2287
02:34:55,574 --> 02:34:57,404
TALIESIN: (slow-mo voice) --the candle--

2288
02:34:57,404 --> 02:34:59,141
MARISHA: Percy, you're in slow-mo! You're slow-mo,
Percy!

2289
02:34:59,141 --> 02:35:00,392
TALIESIN: (slow-mo voice) --back.

2290
02:35:00,392 --> 02:35:01,575
MARISHA: It's amazing!

2291
02:35:01,575 --> 02:35:02,669
LAURA: How do we fix him?

2292
02:35:02,669 --> 02:35:03,935
MARISHA: It'll wear off.

2293
02:35:03,935 --> 02:35:06,340
MATT: Make another wisdom saving throw.

2294
02:35:06,340 --> 02:35:09,610
LIAM: How will he do zingers now?

2295
02:35:09,610 --> 02:35:15,351
TALIESIN: Wisdom, where are we-- 16.

2296
02:35:15,351 --> 02:35:17,042
LIAM: (slow-mo voice) We're slow.

2297
02:35:17,042 --> 02:35:19,335
MATT: (slow-mo voice) Not really changing.

2298
02:35:19,335 --> 02:35:20,777
LAURA: Oh no.

2299
02:35:20,777 --> 02:35:23,243
MARISHA: All right, Fassbender, can you drop
this?

2300
02:35:23,243 --> 02:35:25,192
LIAM: Bet he can't.

2301
02:35:25,192 --> 02:35:28,710
TALIESIN: You asked him a question as opposed to
telling him to do it.

2302
02:35:28,710 --> 02:35:30,691
MARISHA: Fassbender, drop the spell.

2303
02:35:30,691 --> 02:35:38,143
MATT: (slow-mo voice) No apparent change in Percy.
(normal voice) He stands there.

2304
02:35:38,143 --> 02:35:39,894
LAURA: Oh no.

2305
02:35:39,894 --> 02:35:47,765
MARISHA: It'll wear off. Okay. Fassbender, do you
know any other spells, and if so, cast them at the

2306
02:35:47,765 --> 02:35:49,577
dummy this time.

2307
02:35:49,577 --> 02:35:52,917
MATT: Looks at the dummy, looks back at you.

2308
02:35:52,917 --> 02:36:02,150
MARISHA: I go up to Fassbender and I cast Stone
Shape on his chest and see if I can repair that crack.

2309
02:36:02,150 --> 02:36:12,027
Actually, before I do that, can I do a
level one Cure Wounds to see if I can heal him

2310
02:36:12,027 --> 02:36:13,889
first? Okay.

2311
02:36:13,889 --> 02:36:16,298
MATT: Go ahead and roll for that.

2312
02:36:16,298 --> 02:36:18,527
MARISHA: Do I roll a d20 for it?

2313
02:36:18,527 --> 02:36:22,286
SAM: He's talking to a whale right now somewhere.

2314
02:36:22,286 --> 02:36:23,799
MARISHA: Eight points.

2315
02:36:23,799 --> 02:36:27,282
TALIESIN: (slow-mo) hate-- you--

2316
02:36:27,282 --> 02:36:29,289
(laughter)

2317
02:36:29,289 --> 02:36:30,955
LIAM: Tell us all about the nature of politics.

2318
02:36:30,955 --> 02:36:34,480
LAURA: Just think, the fun thing is, I think
you're aging much slower than the rest of us.

2319
02:36:34,480 --> 02:36:38,040
MATT: Okay. This is, this, hmm.

2320
02:36:38,040 --> 02:36:41,656
TALIESIN: (laughs) This is the most torturous
thing ever.

2321
02:36:41,656 --> 02:36:49,375
MATT: So you go ahead and reach out and touch it,
and the healing magic seeps up into the crack that

2322
02:36:49,375 --> 02:36:52,146
Grog left behind, and the crack fuses shut.

2323
02:36:52,146 --> 02:36:55,314
LAURA: That's cool, that's cool.

2324
02:36:55,314 --> 02:36:56,654
MATT: For how much was the total?

2325
02:36:56,654 --> 02:36:57,567
MARISHA: Eight points.

2326
02:36:57,567 --> 02:36:59,463
MATT: Yeah, fuses shut entirely, it's like there
was no crack.

2327
02:36:59,463 --> 02:37:02,270
MARISHA: So he gets healed by a heal--

2328
02:37:02,270 --> 02:37:06,059
MATT: About a minute passes, and then you come
back to your normal pace.

2329
02:37:06,059 --> 02:37:07,656
TALIESIN: No, it's-- no, it's good.

2330
02:37:07,656 --> 02:37:10,109
MARISHA: How was that, how did that feel? Was it
frustrating?

2331
02:37:10,109 --> 02:37:10,903
TALIESIN: Yes!

2332
02:37:10,903 --> 02:37:12,149
MARISHA: Good, good.

2333
02:37:12,149 --> 02:37:14,183
(laughter)

2334
02:37:14,183 --> 02:37:15,381
TALIESIN: Can it--

2335
02:37:15,381 --> 02:37:16,698
MARISHA: Thank you, that's all I need.

2336
02:37:16,698 --> 02:37:18,101
TALIESIN: Can it fly?

2337
02:37:18,101 --> 02:37:20,441
MARISHA: Ooh. Fassbender, can you-- I don't think
he can fly.

2338
02:37:20,441 --> 02:37:21,451
TALIESIN: Just try it.

2339
02:37:21,451 --> 02:37:22,813
MARISHA: Fassbender, can you fly?

2340
02:37:22,813 --> 02:37:23,656
LIAM: Tell it.

2341
02:37:23,656 --> 02:37:27,791
MARISHA: Fly, Fassbender, fly.

2342
02:37:27,791 --> 02:37:30,499
TALIESIN: How high did it jump?

2343
02:37:30,499 --> 02:37:32,799
MARISHA: How high is it jumping?

2344
02:37:32,799 --> 02:37:38,890
MATT: It's getting six feet off the ground
vertically. And then landing with a heavy impact

2345
02:37:38,890 --> 02:37:42,810
each time, causing these divots to
continuously push into the ground.

2346
02:37:42,810 --> 02:37:44,897
LAURA: Ooh, I wonder if it can like earthquake.

2347
02:37:44,897 --> 02:37:51,128
MARISHA: Okay, I Stone Shape, I take a chunk of
the wall and I Stone Shape a boulder. And I hand

2348
02:37:51,128 --> 02:37:53,872
it to him. And I say, throw it at that target.

2349
02:37:53,872 --> 02:37:55,450
MATT: Tiny little boulder.

2350
02:37:55,450 --> 02:37:56,779
MARISHA: Yeah.

2351
02:37:56,779 --> 02:38:01,694
MATT: It hits the target, the stone shatters
across it.

2352
02:38:01,694 --> 02:38:03,179
MARISHA: So his aim's pretty good.

2353
02:38:03,179 --> 02:38:04,095
TALIESIN: All right.

2354
02:38:04,095 --> 02:38:05,228
LAURA: Nice.

2355
02:38:05,228 --> 02:38:09,184
MARISHA: And then I go, Fassbender, high-five.

2356
02:38:09,184 --> 02:38:12,157
Yeah.

2357
02:38:12,157 --> 02:38:14,632
MATT: You take two points of bludgeoning damage.

2358
02:38:14,632 --> 02:38:15,646
MARISHA: Ahh.

2359
02:38:15,646 --> 02:38:17,085
MATT: Unable to control its force.

2360
02:38:17,085 --> 02:38:20,426
MARISHA: Mm. Yeah. You're my buddy, Fassbender.

2361
02:38:20,426 --> 02:38:25,085
TALIESIN: Out of idle curiosity, two last
important things that I would recommend.

2362
02:38:25,085 --> 02:38:26,141
MARISHA: Okay.

2363
02:38:26,141 --> 02:38:33,105
TALIESIN: Perhaps, Fassbender, go into recharge
mode? Or sleep mode? Perhaps? So that maybe it can

2364
02:38:33,105 --> 02:38:40,866
regain some of its magic ability, which it might
burn through? And two, and I'm surprised that I'm

2365
02:38:40,866 --> 02:38:45,123
the one to mention this, but we should
double-check to make sure that that thing isn't

2366
02:38:45,123 --> 02:38:47,443
doing anything strange to your head.

2367
02:38:47,443 --> 02:38:52,179
MATT: For the record, while this has happened,
Mort, who's been following you guys around because

2368
02:38:52,179 --> 02:38:55,612
it's not concentration, the circlet that he was
carrying, the one that you previously had, hit the

2369
02:38:55,612 --> 02:38:58,069
ground. And is lying there on the ground.

2370
02:38:58,069 --> 02:38:59,616
TALIESIN: I'm going to pick that up.

2371
02:38:59,616 --> 02:39:00,709
MARISHA: Thank you.

2372
02:39:00,709 --> 02:39:02,409
TALIESIN: All right. It's very nice.

2373
02:39:02,409 --> 02:39:12,421
MARISHA: Thank you. It's very old. Okay,
Fassbender. Rest.

2374
02:39:12,421 --> 02:39:20,339
MATT: The eyes go to a very, very dull glow, its
form tends to slightly hunch forward in the

2375
02:39:20,339 --> 02:39:24,043
position it was at rest when you found it in the
basement, seems to have gone into some sort of a rest state.

2376
02:39:24,043 --> 02:39:26,153
MARISHA: Okay.

2377
02:39:26,153 --> 02:39:29,008
TALIESIN: Take that off for a bit? Maybe?

2378
02:39:29,008 --> 02:39:30,889
MARISHA: But I like it--

2379
02:39:30,889 --> 02:39:32,814
LAURA: Try taking it off, Kiki.

2380
02:39:32,814 --> 02:39:34,325
MARISHA: It's my friend.

2381
02:39:34,325 --> 02:39:35,984
TALIESIN: It'll be your friend in the morning.

2382
02:39:35,984 --> 02:39:38,094
MARISHA: Okay. I take it off.

2383
02:39:38,094 --> 02:39:42,891
MATT: As you reach up, you go to pull it off your
head--

2384
02:39:42,891 --> 02:39:44,466
and it slides off without a problem.

2385
02:39:44,466 --> 02:39:45,921
(shouting)

2386
02:39:45,921 --> 02:39:47,570
LAURA: I am going to throw something at you!

2387
02:39:47,570 --> 02:39:49,605
TRAVIS: That's like the fifth time today and it's
so good!

2388
02:39:49,605 --> 02:39:51,279
ASHLEY: You sneaky-sneaky.

2389
02:39:51,279 --> 02:39:53,384
TRAVIS: No, like a good horror movie. Fakeouts.

2390
02:39:53,384 --> 02:39:54,894
ASHLEY: As you take it off your head--

2391
02:39:54,894 --> 02:39:57,592
SAM: --your eyes start to bleed.

2392
02:39:57,592 --> 02:39:59,019
MARISHA: I take it off.

2393
02:39:59,019 --> 02:40:03,611
TALIESIN: Seems all right.

2394
02:40:03,611 --> 02:40:06,481
MARISHA: Do I look funny?

2395
02:40:06,481 --> 02:40:09,676
TALIESIN: More than normal? Oh, no, you don't look
different.

2396
02:40:09,676 --> 02:40:11,493
MARISHA: You're a dick.

2397
02:40:11,493 --> 02:40:15,493
TALIESIN: I know. Well, you made a robot cast a
spell on me. An automaton, I suppose.

2398
02:40:15,493 --> 02:40:17,422
MARISHA: Mm, you earned it.

2399
02:40:17,422 --> 02:40:19,048
TALIESIN: That's fair.

2400
02:40:19,048 --> 02:40:24,191
MATT: So, while this is happening-- you guys.

2401
02:40:24,191 --> 02:40:28,734
TRAVIS: Can I turn to Pike and say like, look at
what I got!

2402
02:40:28,734 --> 02:40:30,460
ASHLEY: These are cool!

2403
02:40:30,460 --> 02:40:34,948
TRAVIS: Yeah, right? I don't even feel it. It's
like nothing.

2404
02:40:34,948 --> 02:40:35,911
ASHLEY: You don't?

2405
02:40:35,911 --> 02:40:36,828
TRAVIS: Nope.

2406
02:40:36,828 --> 02:40:37,798
ASHLEY: You don't even feel that?

2407
02:40:37,798 --> 02:40:38,852
TRAVIS: No, nothing.

2408
02:40:38,852 --> 02:40:39,888
ASHLEY: Wow!

2409
02:40:39,888 --> 02:40:45,931
TRAVIS: Well, look. The bloodaxe, right, I've
known this weapon for many, many years, and I

2410
02:40:45,931 --> 02:40:50,492
wanted you to be here when I did this. (whispers)
Can you hear me?

2411
02:40:50,492 --> 02:40:53,535
ASHLEY: Did it say anything to you?

2412
02:40:53,535 --> 02:40:55,427
MATT: No response.

2413
02:40:55,427 --> 02:40:58,534
TRAVIS: No. Which is cool, right?

2414
02:40:58,534 --> 02:41:02,157
ASHLEY: Okay, this is good, this is good, this is
an improvement from your last weapon.

2415
02:41:02,157 --> 02:41:07,887
TRAVIS: Yep, better. Can you tell if it's evil?

2416
02:41:07,887 --> 02:41:09,619
ASHLEY: Bad? Yeah.

2417
02:41:09,619 --> 02:41:12,285
TALIESIN: How awful a person am I?

2418
02:41:12,285 --> 02:41:16,796
MARISHA: You're pretty awful, from what I'm slowly
beginning to learn about you, Percy.

2419
02:41:16,796 --> 02:41:22,638
MATT: What are you doing? There's, the level, what
spell do you have prepared that'll help with this,

2420
02:41:22,638 --> 02:41:24,126
if any?

2421
02:41:24,126 --> 02:41:27,534
That you have prepared.

2422
02:41:27,534 --> 02:41:32,153
ASHLEY: Where'd it go, where'd it go, it was
right-- Can I--

2423
02:41:32,153 --> 02:41:39,293
MATT: There's a level one spell, Detect Good and
Evil, if you have that prepared, that would detect

2424
02:41:39,293 --> 02:41:40,482
for an evil entity.

2425
02:41:40,482 --> 02:41:42,195
LAURA: Do you have Identify?

2426
02:41:42,195 --> 02:41:43,488
TRAVIS: No.

2427
02:41:43,488 --> 02:41:48,698
MATT: Identify is more of an arcane-based.

2428
02:41:48,698 --> 02:41:50,341
TRAVIS: What do you think?

2429
02:41:50,341 --> 02:41:53,831
MATT: That would be like Scanlan or any other
arcane casters you would know.

2430
02:41:53,831 --> 02:41:55,672
ASHLEY: Can I perception check it?

2431
02:41:55,672 --> 02:41:57,586
LAURA: Do you have Identify?

2432
02:41:57,586 --> 02:41:59,165
SAM: I'm not there.

2433
02:41:59,165 --> 02:42:01,399
LAURA: I'm asking you, not you.

2434
02:42:01,399 --> 02:42:03,459
ASHLEY: Insight check it, can I--

2435
02:42:03,459 --> 02:42:04,935
SAM: You'll have to butter me up first.

2436
02:42:04,935 --> 02:42:09,423
MATT: I mean, it's hard to insight check something
that's not living from what you can tell. There's

2437
02:42:09,423 --> 02:42:11,632
no communication, there's nothing, it just looks
like an axe.

2438
02:42:11,632 --> 02:42:15,318
ASHLEY: I'll learn that spell and I'll check it
later.

2439
02:42:15,318 --> 02:42:17,038
TRAVIS: Oh, you can't tell anything?

2440
02:42:17,038 --> 02:42:23,139
ASHLEY: I can't tell anything right now. It looks
pretty normal. And it's a good sign that it's not

2441
02:42:23,139 --> 02:42:24,470
talking to you.

2442
02:42:24,470 --> 02:42:28,365
TRAVIS: Right. So we're already in a better place
than we were before.

2443
02:42:28,365 --> 02:42:31,438
ASHLEY: Yeah. And they look really cool.

2444
02:42:31,438 --> 02:42:41,364
TRAVIS: They do. Hey, wait, keep holding it for a
second. Can I walk over to the wall? Can I punch

2445
02:42:41,364 --> 02:42:42,566
the wall?

2446
02:42:42,566 --> 02:42:43,701
MATT: Sure.

2447
02:42:43,701 --> 02:42:45,228
TRAVIS: I'd like to punch the wall.

2448
02:42:45,228 --> 02:42:46,903
LIAM: It's like our first game ever.

2449
02:42:46,903 --> 02:42:48,716
MARISHA: (Grog voice) I'd like to punch the wall.

2450
02:42:48,716 --> 02:42:57,308
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll for an attack.

2451
02:42:57,308 --> 02:42:58,866
TRAVIS: Wait-- 50.

2452
02:42:58,866 --> 02:43:00,453
LAURA: Wait, that's damage.

2453
02:43:00,453 --> 02:43:01,928
MATT: Wait, no, just damage is doubled.

2454
02:43:01,928 --> 02:43:04,263
TRAVIS: Oh, just damage. 25. 25.

2455
02:43:04,263 --> 02:43:10,510
MATT: That was pretty funny. All right. So. As you
rear back, your fist slams into the stonework here

2456
02:43:10,510 --> 02:43:16,475
of your magnificent mansion, the stonework
shatters, eight, up to 16 points of damage from the

2457
02:43:16,475 --> 02:43:22,178
sheer punch against the wall, the stone sends a
crack through that actually pierces to the top of

2458
02:43:22,178 --> 02:43:26,426
the rather large 25-foot ceiling here in the
training area that has been crafted by Scanlan.

2459
02:43:26,426 --> 02:43:33,383
Stones tumble and hit the ground, a bunch of it,
plaster and pieces fall and hit the area around

2460
02:43:33,383 --> 02:43:37,171
you, causing a small pile of wreckage. Pretty
solid punch.

2461
02:43:37,171 --> 02:43:39,365
ASHLEY: Whoa!

2462
02:43:39,365 --> 02:43:42,991
TRAVIS: I remember being little and Kevdak went
and punched a boulder and it went like

2463
02:43:42,991 --> 02:43:44,815
(stone shattering) and split in half.

2464
02:43:44,815 --> 02:43:46,494
ASHLEY: Whoa, and you just did it with the hands.

2465
02:43:46,494 --> 02:43:48,666
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're going to be busting balls big
time.

2466
02:43:48,666 --> 02:43:49,653
ASHLEY: Can I swing the axe?

2467
02:43:49,653 --> 02:43:51,511
TRAVIS: Yeah, at me?

2468
02:43:51,511 --> 02:43:55,531
ASHLEY: No! At the dummy. I'm going to try it. I'm
going to try swinging the axe at the dummy.

2469
02:43:55,531 --> 02:43:58,383
MATT: It sticks into it.

2470
02:43:58,383 --> 02:44:01,406
TRAVIS: Good swing!

2471
02:44:01,406 --> 02:44:03,099
(laughter)

2472
02:44:03,099 --> 02:44:04,993
MATT: You're not as strong as him per se,
you're--

2473
02:44:04,993 --> 02:44:06,496
TRAVIS: Vicious, vicious. Oh wait--

2474
02:44:06,496 --> 02:44:07,705
MATT: Your strength is 13, right?

2475
02:44:07,705 --> 02:44:08,694
ASHLEY: What's that?

2476
02:44:08,694 --> 02:44:09,751
MATT: Your strength is 13, right?

2477
02:44:09,751 --> 02:44:12,664
ASHLEY: My strength?

2478
02:44:12,664 --> 02:44:13,721
MATT: Strength is 13, right?

2479
02:44:13,721 --> 02:44:15,377
ASHLEY: 19.

2480
02:44:15,377 --> 02:44:17,135
MATT: It's not, because you haven't put the
gauntlets on.

2481
02:44:17,135 --> 02:44:19,198
ASHLEY: I didn't, I don't think I erased that.

2482
02:44:19,198 --> 02:44:26,241
TRAVIS: Well hold on, I had to take the Gauntlets
of Ogre Power off, do you want them back? Now, I

2483
02:44:26,241 --> 02:44:32,713
think you have to give 'em up for the boots, but
it's your pick, it's a kite-- or you can be a monstah!

2484
02:44:32,713 --> 02:44:34,938
ASHLEY: I want to be a monstah!

2485
02:44:34,938 --> 02:44:37,247
(laughter)

2486
02:44:37,247 --> 02:44:38,517
ASHLEY: All right!

2487
02:44:38,517 --> 02:44:42,973
MATT: All righty. So your strength is back up to
19 with the Gauntlets of Ogre Power. Beefy Pike is back.

2488
02:44:42,973 --> 02:44:44,202
ASHLEY: Yeah!

2489
02:44:44,202 --> 02:44:50,772
TRAVIS: I also have-- wait, is Scanlan back?
(sniffs) Do I smell poo?

2490
02:44:50,772 --> 02:44:53,669
MATT: As this time has passed, you guys do return
to the mansion, yeah.

2491
02:44:53,669 --> 02:44:56,684
SAM: Ahh. I'll go down and check on things
downstairs.

2492
02:44:56,684 --> 02:45:00,764
LIAM: Just a minor thing, on the walk back in the
sewer I would like to slowly, just in case some of

2493
02:45:00,764 --> 02:45:07,333
these assholes want to fight a dragon tomorrow, I
slowly start attuning to acidic damage instead of fire.

2494
02:45:07,333 --> 02:45:10,240
MATT: Not a problem. You are currently resistant
to acid damage.

2495
02:45:10,240 --> 02:45:11,506
LIAM: Okay.

2496
02:45:11,506 --> 02:45:16,003
TRAVIS: Didn't I get these Bracers of Defense from
you?

2497
02:45:16,003 --> 02:45:21,292
SAM: Maybe? I don't really remember things like
that.

2498
02:45:21,292 --> 02:45:23,390
TRAVIS: Oh. Do you want 'em back?

2499
02:45:23,390 --> 02:45:24,919
SAM: Bracers of Defense, what do they do?

2500
02:45:24,919 --> 02:45:29,940
TRAVIS: It gives you a plus two to your AC if you
wear no armor and are using no shield.

2501
02:45:29,940 --> 02:45:36,027
SAM: I wear armor, so I could trade them for
something cool?

2502
02:45:36,027 --> 02:45:37,824
TALIESIN: You wear armor?

2503
02:45:37,824 --> 02:45:39,987
SAM: I wear Cold Snap Leather Armor.

2504
02:45:39,987 --> 02:45:42,850
TRAVIS: Does anybody not wear any armor?

2505
02:45:42,850 --> 02:45:45,231
MARISHA: The only one who doesn't wear armor is
you.

2506
02:45:45,231 --> 02:45:51,580
TRAVIS: Yeah! Cool. Well, they're worth like six
thousand gold, so I guess--

2507
02:45:51,580 --> 02:45:54,382
LAURA: Well, fucking hand 'em over, we'll sell 'em
for stuff.

2508
02:45:54,382 --> 02:45:56,004
TRAVIS: I'll hold onto them, thanks.

2509
02:45:56,004 --> 02:45:59,544
LAURA: Grog, I don't trust your haggling skills, I
promise.

2510
02:45:59,544 --> 02:46:04,303
LIAM: If we can ever find a store open in a city
that's not destroyed, we can sell this stuff.

2511
02:46:04,303 --> 02:46:06,497
MARISHA: Not much of an economy right now.

2512
02:46:06,497 --> 02:46:08,483
TRAVIS: For 50! No.

2513
02:46:08,483 --> 02:46:10,062
MATT: You'll have to make your way to another
city.

2514
02:46:10,062 --> 02:46:11,340
LIAM: Back to the Clasp.

2515
02:46:11,340 --> 02:46:12,447
MATT: Yeah.

2516
02:46:12,447 --> 02:46:15,971
TRAVIS: So it's night, it's nighttime.

2517
02:46:15,971 --> 02:46:19,916
LAURA: We should probably figure out if we're
going to fight a fucking dragon in the morning.

2518
02:46:19,916 --> 02:46:22,778
TRAVIS: We owe Zanror a talk one way or the
other.

2519
02:46:22,778 --> 02:46:27,398
LAURA: Oh, gods. We're going to go talk to him
tonight? We need to sleep!

2520
02:46:27,398 --> 02:46:29,232
TRAVIS: Yeah, we need to heal up, big time.

2521
02:46:29,232 --> 02:46:30,817
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm pretty tapped out.

2522
02:46:30,817 --> 02:46:35,493
LIAM: Big Man, what are we going to do in the
morning when we get up?

2523
02:46:35,493 --> 02:46:37,249
SAM: At dawn, we chit-chat!

2524
02:46:37,249 --> 02:46:39,386
ASHLEY: At dawn, we plan.

2525
02:46:39,386 --> 02:46:43,933
TRAVIS: You guys are the biggest fucking dicks
ever. Great conversations have been had at dawn,

2526
02:46:43,933 --> 02:46:49,907
I'll have you know. We're not the only one.
Treaties have been signed, and-- stuff.

2527
02:46:49,907 --> 02:46:53,394
TALIESIN: I'll also, weren't we at some point
supposed to check the library for clues of the

2528
02:46:53,394 --> 02:46:55,155
location of the next Vestige?

2529
02:46:55,155 --> 02:46:59,294
LAURA: What library? Here, the Cobalt Reserve?

2530
02:46:59,294 --> 02:47:00,489
TALIESIN: Yes.

2531
02:47:00,489 --> 02:47:02,454
LAURA: Yes, and we still haven't found Reginald's
daughter.

2532
02:47:02,454 --> 02:47:05,085
TALIESIN: That is a thing.

2533
02:47:05,085 --> 02:47:12,397
SAM: We'll send a carefully worded letter. We
can't roam the city for days trying-- looking for

2534
02:47:12,397 --> 02:47:14,268
some dead guy's daughter, come on.

2535
02:47:14,268 --> 02:47:17,198
TALIESIN: Well, we don't have to, we know where
she is. She's in the prison.

2536
02:47:17,198 --> 02:47:19,185
LAURA: Oh, she's in prison!

2537
02:47:19,185 --> 02:47:20,703
SAM: Well then we should go bust her out!

2538
02:47:20,703 --> 02:47:23,115
TALIESIN: We may just be able to get them to
release her.

2539
02:47:23,115 --> 02:47:25,494
TRAVIS: We might be able to do that.

2540
02:47:25,494 --> 02:47:28,038
MARISHA: It sounds like there were a lot of people
in prison, last we heard.

2541
02:47:28,038 --> 02:47:29,970
LIAM: If we can talk to them, but we have to talk to
them.

2542
02:47:29,970 --> 02:47:32,178
TALIESIN: Grog has to talk to them.

2543
02:47:32,178 --> 02:47:34,306
SAM: Should we sleep first? And go at dawn?

2544
02:47:34,306 --> 02:47:36,713
MARISHA: I don't know if this can wait.

2545
02:47:36,713 --> 02:47:37,899
SAM: What time is it?

2546
02:47:37,899 --> 02:47:40,727
MATT: It's past dusk at this time, the hours you
guys were traveling, I'd say it's probably close

2547
02:47:40,727 --> 02:47:47,215
to 9PM. For you guys to get a full rest, you got
to sleep soon if you're trying to get up pre-dawn.

2548
02:47:47,215 --> 02:47:48,886
It's up to you.

2549
02:47:48,886 --> 02:47:50,202
TRAVIS: How long is a long rest?

2550
02:47:50,202 --> 02:47:51,877
MATT: A long rest is six to eight hours.

2551
02:47:51,877 --> 02:47:57,565
TRAVIS: Six to eight. So on the short end, we
could get up at three and walk over.

2552
02:47:57,565 --> 02:47:59,497
SAM: Wake his ass up.

2553
02:47:59,497 --> 02:48:00,758
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2554
02:48:00,758 --> 02:48:08,409
LAURA: Let's go sleep now, wake up, go let the
prisoners free, and then talk to Kev-- Zanror.

2555
02:48:08,409 --> 02:48:11,259
MARISHA: All right, well, when are we going to
talk amongst ourselves?

2556
02:48:11,259 --> 02:48:14,119
TRAVIS: We should do that now.

2557
02:48:14,119 --> 02:48:16,035
LAURA: Short, short talk.

2558
02:48:16,035 --> 02:48:23,215
TALIESIN: I don't feel comfortable fighting a
dragon on 24 hours' notice after almost getting my

2559
02:48:23,215 --> 02:48:24,599
arse handed to me.

2560
02:48:24,599 --> 02:48:27,335
TRAVIS: All right, that's Percy's vote. Keyleth,
what do you say?

2561
02:48:27,335 --> 02:48:31,909
MARISHA: Can I pass and wait to hear other
people's thoughts?

2562
02:48:31,909 --> 02:48:33,755
TRAVIS: Sure, Vax, what do you say?

2563
02:48:33,755 --> 02:48:38,526
LIAM: Much to my own chagrin, I'm in perfect
agreement with Frederick von Whatsitface de Rolo

2564
02:48:38,526 --> 02:48:39,852
de Whatsit.

2565
02:48:39,852 --> 02:48:41,126
TRAVIS: Vex?

2566
02:48:41,126 --> 02:48:50,754
LAURA: I am-- I stand by what I said before, I
think we should let them go out and fight a

2567
02:48:50,754 --> 02:48:56,768
dragon, and we try to rescue the city while they
are distracted.

2568
02:48:56,768 --> 02:49:00,428
TRAVIS: Badass Hand-Smasher the First?

2569
02:49:00,428 --> 02:49:02,514
SAM: That's you, Pike.

2570
02:49:02,514 --> 02:49:14,487
ASHLEY: That's me. I'm having trouble. What are
you thinking?

2571
02:49:14,487 --> 02:49:26,821
TRAVIS: I wouldn't care if we left now. I don't
think we're ready. I think it would be foolish. I

2572
02:49:26,821 --> 02:49:36,847
learned a lesson yesterday. And I'm anxious to
die, don't get me wrong, but I'd rather win, if we

2573
02:49:36,847 --> 02:49:40,960
planned a little better, than lose.

2574
02:49:40,960 --> 02:49:44,267
LAURA: Are there any big trees in the city?

2575
02:49:44,267 --> 02:49:50,083
TALIESIN: That's not a lot of people. We need to
move a lot of people. How many people are in

2576
02:49:50,083 --> 02:49:52,083
theory still left in the city?

2577
02:49:52,083 --> 02:49:53,474
MATT: You have no idea.

2578
02:49:53,474 --> 02:49:54,842
LAURA: An entire fucking city.

2579
02:49:54,842 --> 02:49:56,141
MARISHA: I think a lot.

2580
02:49:56,141 --> 02:49:59,472
MATT: I mean, a lot of people have left and gone
to Kymal, a lot have left and gone to the Foramere

2581
02:49:59,472 --> 02:50:04,150
Basin, which you already saw. And a lot of people
are still within the city, and currently being

2582
02:50:04,150 --> 02:50:11,075
lorded over and run--or were-- by the Herd, you
don't know quite how many still remain. You've

2583
02:50:11,075 --> 02:50:15,923
seen many jump between homes, and a few that've
waited for this whole thing to blow over.

2584
02:50:15,923 --> 02:50:18,129
TALIESIN: Based on the size of the city and the
number of people I've seen, what would be my

2585
02:50:18,129 --> 02:50:22,273
extrapolation? I'm a reasonable human being.
Triple digits, four digits?

2586
02:50:22,273 --> 02:50:26,747
MATT: I mean, you're looking at maybe four digits,
low four digits.

2587
02:50:26,747 --> 02:50:28,102
TALIESIN: Low four digits, that'll do.

2588
02:50:28,102 --> 02:50:34,832
SAM: Listen, we have this Herd. They will be our
allies for exactly one day.

2589
02:50:34,832 --> 02:50:35,956
TRAVIS: In theory.

2590
02:50:35,956 --> 02:50:44,430
SAM: In theory. So if we do not use them to attack
dragons, can we at least use them to do something?

2591
02:50:44,430 --> 02:50:52,434
Because they will no longer ever be our allies
again after today. We could use them to go try to

2592
02:50:52,434 --> 02:50:59,109
kill the dragon on their own, we could use them to
try to kill something or someone else for us, we

2593
02:50:59,109 --> 02:51:04,628
could use them to try to help clear the city, if
we convinced them that it was in their best

2594
02:51:04,628 --> 02:51:05,739
interest to--

2595
02:51:05,739 --> 02:51:11,189
TRAVIS: I'll amend my proposition to this. I'm not
sure what that word means.

2596
02:51:11,189 --> 02:51:12,838
SAM: 'This'?

2597
02:51:12,838 --> 02:51:20,490
TRAVIS: Yes. If we go and speak to Zanror, and we
can't change his mind about fighting this dragon,

2598
02:51:20,490 --> 02:51:26,938
which I'm not entirely comfortable asking him to
do, we at least get the innocents, prisoners, and

2599
02:51:26,938 --> 02:51:35,342
hostages out of the city. We pretend that we're
going to fight the dragon with him, and when shit

2600
02:51:35,342 --> 02:51:38,189
goes down, we wait.

2601
02:51:38,189 --> 02:51:41,056
MARISHA: That's actually what I was thinking.

2602
02:51:41,056 --> 02:51:43,399
TALIESIN: This is not a bad plan.

2603
02:51:43,399 --> 02:51:49,683
MARISHA: We have the means to bail us out very
quickly if things go wrong.

2604
02:51:49,683 --> 02:52:00,860
TRAVIS: And if I may, in case any of your
consciences are in conflict, the Herd is full of

2605
02:52:00,860 --> 02:52:10,428
murderers and pillagers and rapists and child
killers. The worst of the lot. And only when I was

2606
02:52:10,428 --> 02:52:15,932
younger did I not know the difference between
right and wrong. Still working on that definition.

2607
02:52:15,932 --> 02:52:26,446
But I can tell you, this group ain't the best lot
in the world, and they mean nothing to me compared

2608
02:52:26,446 --> 02:52:28,401
to the people in this room.

2609
02:52:28,401 --> 02:52:35,852
MARISHA: Conversely, you were a part of that lot
once. And you came out of it.

2610
02:52:35,852 --> 02:52:43,443
TRAVIS: Once. But are we trying to save a herd? Or
are we trying to save a town?

2611
02:52:43,443 --> 02:52:48,699
MARISHA: I think we're trying to save the world at
this point.

2612
02:52:48,699 --> 02:52:50,672
TRAVIS: That's bigger than a town, right?

2613
02:52:50,672 --> 02:52:51,903
LIAM: By a bit.

2614
02:52:51,903 --> 02:52:53,026
LAURA: A little.

2615
02:52:53,026 --> 02:52:55,184
TALIESIN: Today we can save a town.

2616
02:52:55,184 --> 02:53:02,581
SAM: You know, we're all gathered here together,
so I'd like to take this opportunity with

2617
02:53:02,581 --> 02:53:10,712
Wilhand's blessing to propose marriage to you,
Pike Trickfoot. Will you make me the happiest

2618
02:53:10,712 --> 02:53:17,752
gnome ever? I'm sorry, I couldn't contain myself
any longer.

2619
02:53:17,752 --> 02:53:21,137
ASHLEY: That was so sudden!

2620
02:53:21,137 --> 02:53:25,943
SAM: I know, I'm sorry, I've been thinking about
it all night tonight, I went looking for Kaylie,

2621
02:53:25,943 --> 02:53:31,432
she wasn't there, and then-- I'm sorry, I blurted
it out, it's just, we're all together, we're never

2622
02:53:31,432 --> 02:53:33,386
all together like this, so.

2623
02:53:33,386 --> 02:53:35,590
LIAM: Can I roll stealth and hide right now?

2624
02:53:35,590 --> 02:53:36,802
(laughter)

2625
02:53:36,802 --> 02:53:37,920
MATT: Go ahead.

2626
02:53:37,920 --> 02:53:39,390
ASHLEY: Can I roll stealth and hide right now?

2627
02:53:39,390 --> 02:53:41,095
MATT: You can try to if you want to.

2628
02:53:41,095 --> 02:53:42,337
LIAM: 28, I'm gone.

2629
02:53:42,337 --> 02:53:46,945
TALIESIN: Scanlan, at least this could wait until
after the danger's over.

2630
02:53:46,945 --> 02:53:50,519
SAM: I know, I know, but we may die later tonight
when we go see Zanror.

2631
02:53:50,519 --> 02:53:52,102
TALIESIN: Only if we follow your example.

2632
02:53:52,102 --> 02:53:54,532
MARISHA: That was the most impressive segue I've
ever encountered.

2633
02:53:54,532 --> 02:53:56,435
TALIESIN: I was trying really hard here.

2634
02:53:56,435 --> 02:53:58,386
ASHLEY: That was a segue if I've ever heard one.

2635
02:53:58,386 --> 02:54:06,026
SAM: You know what, don't answer now, don't answer
now. I know that you want to say yes, but please,

2636
02:54:06,026 --> 02:54:10,891
don't answer yet. Just think about it and we'll
talk about it some other time.

2637
02:54:10,891 --> 02:54:17,562
ASHLEY: I will definitely have to think about it.
Because that's a lot--

2638
02:54:17,562 --> 02:54:20,218
TALIESIN: We can work on some sort of concoction
if you need help sleeping after that information,

2639
02:54:20,218 --> 02:54:22,890
at this point. That would keep me up for hours.
That's-- yeah.

2640
02:54:22,890 --> 02:54:25,239
LIAM: Do we have any alore root?

2641
02:54:25,239 --> 02:54:29,451
(laughter)

2642
02:54:29,451 --> 02:54:33,806
MARISHA: You ever want a vision quest, just let me
know.

2643
02:54:33,806 --> 02:54:45,188
ASHLEY: You know what, I will think on it, and I
will give you an answer after some dragons are

2644
02:54:45,188 --> 02:54:52,048
killed and-- let me think on it, Scanlan. Let me
think on it.

2645
02:54:52,048 --> 02:54:54,187
SAM: All right.

2646
02:54:54,187 --> 02:54:56,488
LAURA: (whispers) I think that went well.

2647
02:54:56,488 --> 02:54:58,052
TRAVIS: Do you mean, like, permanent marriage?

2648
02:54:58,052 --> 02:54:59,591
ASHLEY: I think I was really start-- yeah.

2649
02:54:59,591 --> 02:55:04,408
SAM: No no no, I'm sorry, that didn't, I didn't do
that the way I had planned it in my head, I'm sorry.

2650
02:55:04,408 --> 02:55:05,601
ASHLEY: It's okay.

2651
02:55:05,601 --> 02:55:10,593
SAM: I was overcome with a lot of stress, you
know? We're fighting dragons and bonding with

2652
02:55:10,593 --> 02:55:16,159
goliaths here and you're in my house, and it's a
very very stressful night for me, I'm sorry.

2653
02:55:16,159 --> 02:55:18,809
MARISHA: That was the weirdest coping mechanism
I've ever heard of.

2654
02:55:18,809 --> 02:55:20,532
SAM: Yeah, yeah. I'm sorry.

2655
02:55:20,532 --> 02:55:25,423
ASHLEY: It's okay, maybe you just feel that way because
we could all die, so.

2656
02:55:25,423 --> 02:55:26,559
SAM: For sure.

2657
02:55:26,559 --> 02:55:29,788
ASHLEY: You feel like you maybe-- I don't know.

2658
02:55:29,788 --> 02:55:31,418
SAM: You know what, we'll table it. We'll table
it.

2659
02:55:31,418 --> 02:55:32,385
ASHLEY: We'll table it.

2660
02:55:32,385 --> 02:55:33,380
SAM: We'll table it.

2661
02:55:33,380 --> 02:55:37,173
ASHLEY: Okay. Where is Wilhand?

2662
02:55:37,173 --> 02:55:39,087
SAM: I think he's in the kitchen.

2663
02:55:39,087 --> 02:55:41,467
ASHLEY: He's probably made a delicious meal.

2664
02:55:41,467 --> 02:55:44,071
LAURA: We should eat and then sleep.

2665
02:55:44,071 --> 02:55:48,748
MATT: You guys make your way to the kitchen?

2666
02:55:48,748 --> 02:55:51,364
MARISHA: Well, let's finish this conversation over
food.

2667
02:55:51,364 --> 02:55:53,081
MATT: There is a-- what did you have in mind?

2668
02:55:53,081 --> 02:55:56,320
LIAM: I'm going back to my room, I'm not eating.
Yeah.

2669
02:55:56,320 --> 02:55:58,210
MARISHA: Wait, we need to finish this
conversation.

2670
02:55:58,210 --> 02:56:06,229
MATT: He's already gone, you don't know where he
is. Vax disappeared in the confusion. You head

2671
02:56:06,229 --> 02:56:11,580
back to the main dining area. There is a full meal
prepared of very creative uses of chicken.

2672
02:56:11,580 --> 02:56:15,591
(laughter)

2673
02:56:15,591 --> 02:56:18,687
ASHLEY: It's all-- if he had more stuff, he could
really do well.

2674
02:56:18,687 --> 02:56:22,238
TALIESIN: I don't-- I don't think you're supposed
to eat-- that's creative.

2675
02:56:22,238 --> 02:56:24,055
MARISHA: Every chicken dish ever.

2676
02:56:24,055 --> 02:56:25,471
TALIESIN: I'll have the soup.

2677
02:56:25,471 --> 02:56:30,998
MATT: Wilhand is slumped in the corner on a stool
with a bottle of wine that is mostly empty.

2678
02:56:30,998 --> 02:56:33,461
LIAM: (old-man voice) Try the chicken sorbet!

2679
02:56:33,461 --> 02:56:35,882
MATT: A bit of drool dribbling down his neck.

2680
02:56:35,882 --> 02:56:43,422
TRAVIS: I take the bottle. He pulled it back! I
let him have it.

2681
02:56:43,422 --> 02:56:47,779
LAURA: I go and whisper to Scanlan, are you all
right?

2682
02:56:47,779 --> 02:56:52,398
SAM: Yeah, I'm fine. She didn't say no?

2683
02:56:52,398 --> 02:56:55,852
LAURA: She didn't. I sort of meant about Kaylie as
well, though.

2684
02:56:55,852 --> 02:57:04,912
SAM: Oh, yes. I just don't know where she is, so it's a
bit stressful. That's all. She's safe though,

2685
02:57:04,912 --> 02:57:09,783
right? Just say yes.

2686
02:57:09,783 --> 02:57:12,173
LAURA: Yes. Of course she is.

2687
02:57:12,173 --> 02:57:13,669
SAM: Yeah, I thought so.

2688
02:57:13,669 --> 02:57:17,256
TRAVIS: I go and grab a shitload of chicken and
start shoving it in my mouth.

2689
02:57:17,256 --> 02:57:18,967
MARISHA: Is Wilhand here?

2690
02:57:18,967 --> 02:57:20,380
TRAVIS: He's passed out.

2691
02:57:20,380 --> 02:57:22,542
MATT: He's passed out in a corner with a bottle of
white wine that's half-empty.

2692
02:57:22,542 --> 02:57:24,807
ASHLEY: I go get a blanket and cover him.

2693
02:57:24,807 --> 02:57:28,911
MARISHA: I walk over and I slide the bottle of ale
out of his hand.

2694
02:57:28,911 --> 02:57:31,907
MATT: (laughs) Death grip on the bottle.

2695
02:57:31,907 --> 02:57:39,508
MARISHA: All right. I leave the bottle of ale and
I take the statue of Sarenrae and I put it in his

2696
02:57:39,508 --> 02:57:41,530
other hand, tuck him up.

2697
02:57:41,530 --> 02:57:45,369
MATT: Cuddles it up with the blanket around it,
he's like this little bundle of old gnomish

2698
02:57:45,369 --> 02:57:47,443
sleeping joy right now.

2699
02:57:47,443 --> 02:57:48,999
ASHLEY: Oh, buddy.

2700
02:57:48,999 --> 02:57:50,274
TRAVIS: Is Vax here?

2701
02:57:50,274 --> 02:57:51,562
MATT: No.

2702
02:57:51,562 --> 02:57:55,382
TRAVIS: Shit. I wanted to put like shaving cream
in his hand and tickle his nose with a feather.

2703
02:57:55,382 --> 02:58:00,018
MARISHA: Although I feel like we still need to
finish this conversation.

2704
02:58:00,018 --> 02:58:01,467
Shouldn't we all be present?

2705
02:58:01,467 --> 02:58:03,743
TRAVIS: What's left to finish?

2706
02:58:03,743 --> 02:58:06,783
TALIESIN: Other than take a rest.

2707
02:58:06,783 --> 02:58:10,660
SAM: We're going to try to convince them to delay.
If they won't delay, then we say, all right,

2708
02:58:10,660 --> 02:58:12,864
let's go fight, and we send them into battle.

2709
02:58:12,864 --> 02:58:15,216
LAURA: And then we don't really fight.

2710
02:58:15,216 --> 02:58:16,294
MARISHA: Huh?

2711
02:58:16,294 --> 02:58:19,867
LAURA: Well, we see how they do, and we try to
rescue people.

2712
02:58:19,867 --> 02:58:24,505
MARISHA: Maybe it's time to split up. Maybe some
of us help fight the dragons while

2713
02:58:24,505 --> 02:58:25,949
others help evacuate.

2714
02:58:25,949 --> 02:58:32,946
LAURA: No. I'm not separating from you when we go
fight a giant fucking dragon.

2715
02:58:32,946 --> 02:58:39,793
TALIESIN: I may run to try and quietly by myself
grab a few things from the library that we may

2716
02:58:39,793 --> 02:58:41,663
need for the next Vestiges.

2717
02:58:41,663 --> 02:58:43,262
MARISHA: You're going tonight?

2718
02:58:43,262 --> 02:58:45,467
TALIESIN: Ah. Possibly in the morning.

2719
02:58:45,467 --> 02:58:47,620
MARISHA: I'll go with you.

2720
02:58:47,620 --> 02:58:50,400
MATT: You do recall based on your previous scrying
spell--

2721
02:58:50,400 --> 02:58:53,006
MARISHA: It was ruined and most of it had been
picked clean.

2722
02:58:53,006 --> 02:58:58,644
MATT: --it was ruined, a lot of it picked over,
Allura was escaping with a couple of tomes under

2723
02:58:58,644 --> 02:59:01,152
her arms before escaping via spark.

2724
02:59:01,152 --> 02:59:02,715
TALIESIN: Oh, all right then.

2725
02:59:02,715 --> 02:59:05,909
MARISHA: I mean, it doesn't mean that there's not
something still potentially there, but I'm sure

2726
02:59:05,909 --> 02:59:09,905
Allura got most of the good stuff. She's not
stupid.

2727
02:59:09,905 --> 02:59:11,433
TALIESIN: No, that's fair.

2728
02:59:11,433 --> 02:59:14,529
MARISHA: We can still check it out.

2729
02:59:14,529 --> 02:59:18,129
MATT: So what's the plan?

2730
02:59:18,129 --> 02:59:20,396
TRAVIS: We go to sleep--

2731
02:59:20,396 --> 02:59:27,287
LIAM: I don't have a plan, but while they're all
dicking about, after about an hour of staring at

2732
02:59:27,287 --> 02:59:43,761
the wall, I start talking to the air, and say: you
know, I've never put much stock in faith. And for

2733
02:59:43,761 --> 02:59:54,835
the life of me, I question so much why my sister
took that broom and I can't figure out another

2734
02:59:54,835 --> 03:00:00,286
reason for her to have done it, other than fate,
for I would not be standing here, nor would anyone

2735
03:00:00,286 --> 03:00:23,731
else in my family. So. You weren't my first
choice, but I'm over that. And I'm ready. I will

2736
03:00:23,731 --> 03:00:36,340
come to you as soon as I am able. I don't know how
any of this works. I'm coming. Whatever we need to

2737
03:00:36,340 --> 03:00:47,041
do. I don't know what I believe, but I made a
promise and I'm sticking to it and I'm coming to

2738
03:00:47,041 --> 03:00:49,839
you. So just hang on.

2739
03:00:49,839 --> 03:01:00,336
MATT: Minutes of silence pass. No response.
Nothing.

2740
03:01:00,336 --> 03:01:04,814
LIAM: I go to bed.

2741
03:01:04,814 --> 03:01:08,431
MATT: Okay. As you get to your bed, you look down
and a single black feather is currently set on the

2742
03:01:08,431 --> 03:01:09,992
pillow before you.

2743
03:01:09,992 --> 03:01:13,603
LIAM: I tuck it behind my ear.

2744
03:01:13,603 --> 03:01:19,634
MATT: All right. The rest of you going to sleep
for the evening?

2745
03:01:19,634 --> 03:01:21,039
ALL: Yes.

2746
03:01:21,039 --> 03:01:30,042
ASHLEY: As we're walking to sleep, I grab Scanlan
real quick. I grabbed Scanlan real quick once

2747
03:01:30,042 --> 03:01:31,336
everybody's--

2748
03:01:31,336 --> 03:01:32,532
MATT: Okay.

2749
03:01:32,532 --> 03:01:35,341
ASHLEY: So, I have to tell you something.

2750
03:01:35,341 --> 03:01:37,994
SAM: You don't have to answer now.

2751
03:01:37,994 --> 03:01:39,331
ASHLEY: It's not an answer for that.

2752
03:01:39,331 --> 03:01:46,433
SAM: No, it's fine, I was, it was, I was impetuous
and silly and I don't know sometimes, I get

2753
03:01:46,500 --> 03:01:51,222
hamhanded around you-- I'm very smooth with
everybody else, I don't know what it is.

2754
03:01:51,222 --> 03:02:04,254
ASHLEY: It's just that-- it's fine. It's okay. I
have to confess something to you. When you gave me

2755
03:02:04,254 --> 03:02:05,412
that letter--

2756
03:02:05,412 --> 03:02:06,605
SAM: Yes?

2757
03:02:06,605 --> 03:02:09,576
ASHLEY: When you told me not to read it until you
died--

2758
03:02:09,576 --> 03:02:11,098
SAM: Yes?

2759
03:02:11,098 --> 03:02:19,070
ASHLEY: I read it immediately after you left.
Because curiosity gets the best of me sometimes, I

2760
03:02:19,070 --> 03:02:20,559
can't-- it's not--

2761
03:02:20,559 --> 03:02:22,599
SAM: But you can't, you're like a priest or
something, you can't lie!

2762
03:02:22,599 --> 03:02:24,646
ASHLEY: I know, but that-- what does that even
mean?

2763
03:02:24,646 --> 03:02:26,126
SAM: I don't know, I--

2764
03:02:26,126 --> 03:02:28,811
ASHLEY: I go back and forth with it.

2765
03:02:28,811 --> 03:02:30,399
SAM: There was personal stuff in there!

2766
03:02:30,399 --> 03:02:39,672
ASHLEY: I know, but what-- I know, it was very
personal, and I just wanted to tell you that

2767
03:02:39,672 --> 03:02:43,408
everything you said in that letter, I promise to
you.

2768
03:02:43,408 --> 03:02:45,695
SAM: You do?

2769
03:02:45,695 --> 03:02:53,915
ASHLEY: That I give you my word that everything
you said in that letter I promise to you I will do.

2770
03:02:53,915 --> 03:02:56,350
SAM: Really.

2771
03:02:56,350 --> 03:02:58,912
ASHLEY: If you die.

2772
03:02:58,912 --> 03:03:01,987
(laughter)

2773
03:03:01,987 --> 03:03:04,367
ASHLEY: Which I am hoping that you never do.

2774
03:03:04,367 --> 03:03:07,223
SAM: Well, we've almost died a few times very
recently.

2775
03:03:07,223 --> 03:03:13,683
ASHLEY: I know, and we've had so many close calls
and I feel like I just needed to tell you so you

2776
03:03:13,683 --> 03:03:20,045
had some comfort in your person, in your body,
that you knew that if--

2777
03:03:20,045 --> 03:03:25,669
SAM: My body? What are you t-- you sound like me,
you're stammering and babbling like I was!

2778
03:03:25,669 --> 03:03:29,043
ASHLEY: I know, you do make me a little nervous
and I'm not really sure why, and I need to

2779
03:03:29,043 --> 03:03:30,164
reconcile these feelings.

2780
03:03:30,164 --> 03:03:31,788
SAM: We should just marry then!

2781
03:03:31,788 --> 03:03:32,791
ASHLEY: Well, I don't know!

2782
03:03:32,791 --> 03:03:35,694
SAM: I don't know either! It's a very strange
relationship.

2783
03:03:35,694 --> 03:03:39,671
ASHLEY: I'm so confused. Maybe we should just
sleep together and see what happens.

2784
03:03:39,671 --> 03:03:43,236
SAM: Okay, fine. No, you said it! You said it!

2785
03:03:43,236 --> 03:03:46,852
ASHLEY: I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding, it was
just a joke.

2786
03:03:46,852 --> 03:03:48,678
SAM: You can't joke about that stuff with me!

2787
03:03:48,678 --> 03:03:56,721
ASHLEY: I know. I'm being careless, I think that
drink that Wilhand gave me is settling, and it's--

2788
03:03:56,721 --> 03:04:03,170
moving about. Making me say things.

2789
03:04:03,170 --> 03:04:04,797
SAM: I don't even know what's going on right now!

2790
03:04:04,797 --> 03:04:07,502
ASHLEY: I'm just kidding. I don't actually think
we should sleep together. I just need to tell you

2791
03:04:07,502 --> 03:04:08,582
that I--

2792
03:04:08,582 --> 03:04:10,796
SAM: Thank you for clarifying?!

2793
03:04:10,796 --> 03:04:14,822
(laughter)

2794
03:04:14,822 --> 03:04:17,984
ASHLEY: Anyway, Scanlan, I love you.

2795
03:04:17,984 --> 03:04:26,673
SAM: This is not how I thought tonight was going
to go! I feel betrayed, I feel let down, I feel so

2796
03:04:26,673 --> 03:04:28,122
horny right now!

2797
03:04:28,122 --> 03:04:35,041
ASHLEY: Well, you've grown those forearms for a
reason, so just go take care of business.

2798
03:04:35,041 --> 03:04:37,119
SAM: Oh, come on, Pike!

2799
03:04:37,119 --> 03:04:39,969
LIAM: That's some reincorporation right here.

2800
03:04:39,969 --> 03:04:42,946
MARISHA: Callback!

2801
03:04:42,946 --> 03:04:52,666
SAM: Listen. Everything I said in that letter I
meant. And regardless of whether or not you

2802
03:04:52,666 --> 03:05:01,323
totally betrayed me by reading it, I'm glad that
you at least understood the sentiment, I hope?

2803
03:05:01,323 --> 03:05:02,967
ASHLEY: I did.

2804
03:05:02,967 --> 03:05:13,642
SAM: And appreciated my honesty and the fact that
you are taking that vow? If I die.

2805
03:05:13,642 --> 03:05:16,596
ASHLEY: Yes, I am taking <i>that</i> vow.

2806
03:05:16,596 --> 03:05:24,115
SAM: Yes, I understand. Well then, that's fine.
That's all I need.

2807
03:05:24,115 --> 03:05:27,121
ASHLEY: Okay. And I was trying to be funny and I
didn't mean to be careless with your feelings.

2808
03:05:27,121 --> 03:05:29,821
SAM: No, I know, I didn't know why I proposed,
that's stupid.

2809
03:05:29,821 --> 03:05:32,339
ASHLEY: I do love you so much.

2810
03:05:32,339 --> 03:05:33,309
SAM: I love you!

2811
03:05:33,309 --> 03:05:40,101
ASHLEY: And a part of my heart does-- I do love
somebody else very much.

2812
03:05:40,101 --> 03:05:41,404
SAM: I'm sorry?

2813
03:05:41,404 --> 03:05:48,354
ASHLEY: But my feelings are growing for you a
little bit in a weird way and I'm not sure what it

2814
03:05:48,354 --> 03:05:53,560
is, but we'll figure it out. I'm confused.

2815
03:05:53,560 --> 03:06:04,673
SAM: I think we both are? Anyway. Thank you for
telling me the truth after you sort of lied to me, so--

2816
03:06:04,673 --> 03:06:07,380
ASHLEY: But I never told you I did not read it!

2817
03:06:07,380 --> 03:06:13,689
SAM: --oh, I know, but all right. Anyway. Thank
you for this-- sort of. I guess I have to go to my

2818
03:06:13,689 --> 03:06:18,250
room and think about this while I stare at my
picture in the mirror above my bed.

2819
03:06:18,250 --> 03:06:20,897
ASHLEY: Which is-- what's your picture?

2820
03:06:20,897 --> 03:06:22,101
SAM: It's just a mirror.

2821
03:06:22,101 --> 03:06:23,520
(laughter)

2822
03:06:23,520 --> 03:06:33,646
SAM: But, listen. I do love you, I will always
love you, even in death, and thank you for telling

2823
03:06:33,646 --> 03:06:39,687
me that and-- I hope it doesn't come to that, but
if it does, that makes me feel a little bit better

2824
03:06:39,687 --> 03:06:41,385
about things.

2825
03:06:41,385 --> 03:06:43,564
ASHLEY: Okay. Well, I love you.

2826
03:06:43,564 --> 03:06:45,177
SAM: Sleep tight.

2827
03:06:45,177 --> 03:06:47,144
ASHLEY: I give him a hug and a kiss on his cheek.

2828
03:06:47,144 --> 03:06:48,726
MATT: Okay.

2829
03:06:48,726 --> 03:06:58,723
SAM: I kick the dirt a little bit and then I walk
away and I click my heels. Little jump-and-click.

2830
03:06:58,723 --> 03:07:11,403
MATT: And-- anything else, before the evening's
rest comes? All right. Sleep finds you all, some

2831
03:07:11,403 --> 03:07:16,816
easier than others, until a measured period of
time, I believe?

2832
03:07:16,816 --> 03:07:17,847
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2833
03:07:17,847 --> 03:07:26,774
MATT: Grog sprung awake, gathered the folks in the
pre-dawn hour of the following morning. You gather

2834
03:07:26,774 --> 03:07:34,203
your stuff, exit the mansion, and start making
your way towards the Margrave's house.

2835
03:07:34,203 --> 03:07:38,791
TRAVIS: Is there anyone on the street?

2836
03:07:38,791 --> 03:07:41,484
MATT: Make a perception check.

2837
03:07:41,484 --> 03:07:49,744
TRAVIS: 19. Plus zero.

2838
03:07:49,744 --> 03:08:01,272
MATT: You guys exit Wilhand's place and there is a
cross-street that Wilhand's home is nearby, that's

2839
03:08:01,272 --> 03:08:05,058
like a building sandwiching it on each side, and
the one just south of it is on the corner of that

2840
03:08:05,058 --> 03:08:10,777
cross street. Across the way as you guys exit the
room, or exit the front of the building, you see

2841
03:08:10,777 --> 03:08:15,290
two figures stand up, arms crossed. The same
individuals you saw earlier.

2842
03:08:15,290 --> 03:08:16,659
MARISHA: Of Wilhand's place?

2843
03:08:16,659 --> 03:08:23,997
TRAVIS: Same people I saw outside of the house
earlier. All right, fuck this shit. I turn and I

2844
03:08:23,997 --> 03:08:25,911
walk towards those two people.

2845
03:08:25,911 --> 03:08:30,583
MATT: Okay. You approach, you recognize them.
They're the same two people that were watching you

2846
03:08:30,583 --> 03:08:34,478
while you guys were resting directly after the battle
with Kevdak in the center of the square, the two

2847
03:08:34,478 --> 03:08:37,018
that were assigned to keep an eye on you.

2848
03:08:37,018 --> 03:08:39,834
TRAVIS: Hello. What're your two names?

2849
03:08:39,834 --> 03:08:46,295
MATT: They look at each other. "Veskin. Mortar.
What do you want?"

2850
03:08:46,295 --> 03:08:55,031
TRAVIS: Funny, I feel like I've seen you about in
the last few hours, watching us.

2851
03:08:55,031 --> 03:08:57,699
MATT: "Keeping an eye out."

2852
03:08:57,699 --> 03:08:59,800
TRAVIS: Huh. Why?

2853
03:08:59,800 --> 03:09:07,410
MATT: "Because you killed our leader. Takes a
while to see what strength is a man who's killed

2854
03:09:07,410 --> 03:09:13,859
"your leader. If he's a murderer. If he's an
honor-bound man. Or if he's a piece of shit that

2855
03:09:13,859 --> 03:09:15,827
"you should wipe off your heels."

2856
03:09:15,827 --> 03:09:16,945
TRAVIS: Hm.

2857
03:09:16,945 --> 03:09:19,781
MATT: "Takes a bit of watching to get that. Jury's
still out."

2858
03:09:19,781 --> 03:09:23,266
TRAVIS: Don't you have a new leader now?

2859
03:09:23,266 --> 03:09:29,474
MATT: They look at each other. "Maybe."

2860
03:09:29,474 --> 03:09:36,506
TRAVIS: Would you like to walk with us? We're
going for a little morning stroll.

2861
03:09:36,506 --> 03:09:39,995
MATT: "Nothing else to do."

2862
03:09:39,995 --> 03:09:45,995
And they wipe a little bit of sleep from one
of the corner of the eye. "Lead on."

2863
03:09:45,995 --> 03:09:50,129
TRAVIS: And we head to the Margrave's house.

2864
03:09:50,129 --> 03:09:51,760
MATT: Okay.

2865
03:09:51,760 --> 03:09:58,533
MARISHA: I put my old-school circlet back on, by
the way, but I have the other circlet with me.

2866
03:09:58,533 --> 03:10:02,762
MATT: Okay. So you've re-attuned to the original
circlet. You guys, walking through the town as you

2867
03:10:02,762 --> 03:10:10,779
do, there is a bit of business, there are, some of
the street lanterns have been lit, where

2868
03:10:10,779 --> 03:10:15,770
previously at this hour they would be greatly
diminished, there is movement, you see some of

2869
03:10:15,770 --> 03:10:22,814
the Herd that are now wandering forth,
armoring up, gathering weapons, you know this.

2870
03:10:22,814 --> 03:10:29,896
This is the morning before a siege. This is the
pre-dawn meditation before the Herd takes its

2871
03:10:29,896 --> 03:10:38,302
next-- yeah. Warpaint being applied, breakfasts
being enjoyed, people preparing themselves for the

2872
03:10:38,302 --> 03:10:46,231
frenzy of battle, this is the pre-war ritual of
the Herd of Storms. As you make your way

2873
03:10:46,231 --> 03:10:53,072
southward, across the once-battlefield,
returned-town-square outside the Margrave's home,

2874
03:10:53,072 --> 03:11:01,441
to the front doors, the door is open and you see
there are two individuals sitting at the front.

2875
03:11:01,441 --> 03:11:13,912
One of which is a goliath keeping watch, to the
right of him on the other side is a gruff-looking

2876
03:11:13,912 --> 03:11:19,625
female human, humanoid, sitting there, arms
crossed, watching as you guys approach.

2877
03:11:19,625 --> 03:11:27,167
TRAVIS: I make eye contact with both of them. I
seek an audience with Zanror.

2878
03:11:27,167 --> 03:11:29,932
MATT: "He's expecting you, get in."

2879
03:11:29,932 --> 03:11:33,058
TRAVIS: We go in.

2880
03:11:33,058 --> 03:11:38,000
MATT: So you guys walk into the house, you see the
interior of the Margrave's abode. Across the way

2881
03:11:38,000 --> 03:11:49,498
there is a haphazard throne that's been built from
lumber and carts and things that were pulled from

2882
03:11:49,498 --> 03:11:54,909
resources within the town. You can see this
is probably where Kevdak sat once they had taken

2883
03:11:54,909 --> 03:11:56,521
the home, the estate.

2884
03:11:56,521 --> 03:12:00,130
TRAVIS: I grab my earpiece and very lightly say,
Vax, keep your eyes about you.

2885
03:12:00,130 --> 03:12:01,545
MATT: Are you all entering with Grog?

2886
03:12:01,545 --> 03:12:03,685
ALL: Yeah, sure.

2887
03:12:03,685 --> 03:12:06,557
SAM: Should we leave a couple outside or anything
or no?

2888
03:12:06,557 --> 03:12:08,024
TRAVIS: Nope, stay together.

2889
03:12:08,024 --> 03:12:12,108
MATT: Okay. You guys all enter into the foyer
area. The throne is across the way, there's a long

2890
03:12:12,108 --> 03:12:17,397
hallway that leads to the back of the estate, and
at the very back you can see the throne. There are

2891
03:12:17,397 --> 03:12:23,535
some low sconces in the walls that give the
flicker of light, in the center there is a round

2892
03:12:23,535 --> 03:12:30,230
table which is currently set. There are some
weapons and daggers, a few javelins tossed onto

2893
03:12:30,230 --> 03:12:38,487
it, looks like some fruit that's partially eaten,
and there on the table you see Zanror, already

2894
03:12:38,487 --> 03:12:43,586
armored up, arms splayed across the side, looking
down at the table, looking down at the weapons

2895
03:12:43,586 --> 03:12:53,711
before him. Behind him, you see his wife, the
lady, the other pregnant goliath that is currently

2896
03:12:53,711 --> 03:12:58,158
behind rubbing his shoulders and talking to him
into his ear. They both look up and see as you

2897
03:12:58,158 --> 03:13:01,616
approach, at which point Zanror whispers to her
for a second.

2898
03:13:01,616 --> 03:13:03,307
LAURA: What does he say?

2899
03:13:03,307 --> 03:13:13,115
MATT: He says, "We have company." They both sit
back as he goes upright as you approach. "Glad to

2900
03:13:13,115 --> 03:13:20,248
"see you had the sense to take my summons. So.
Now's the day where we prepare."

2901
03:13:20,248 --> 03:13:23,636
TRAVIS: Aye, wouldn't miss it for the world.

2902
03:13:23,636 --> 03:13:35,913
MATT: (sighs) "First and foremost, Grog, take that
shit off. It's really freaking out most of our people."

2903
03:13:35,913 --> 03:13:39,614
TRAVIS: It is pretty sweet, though, isn't it?

2904
03:13:39,614 --> 03:13:43,088
MATT: "It's confusing, to say the least, aye?"

2905
03:13:43,088 --> 03:13:48,670
TRAVIS: We all have our preparations to make
before battle. Don't worry about mine.

2906
03:13:48,670 --> 03:13:55,892
MATT: "To each their own, I suppose. Heh. You've
fallen in some strange paths since we last met."

2907
03:13:55,892 --> 03:13:58,301
TRAVIS: You have no idea.

2908
03:13:58,301 --> 03:14:04,934
MATT: "Rest of you, can we expect your attendance
in this glorious fight?"

2909
03:14:04,934 --> 03:14:09,243
LIAM: Wherever Grog goes, we go as well.

2910
03:14:09,243 --> 03:14:12,320
MATT: "Good. Good."

2911
03:14:12,320 --> 03:14:19,237
MARISHA: I suppose we could ask the same of your
Herd, Leader Zanror.

2912
03:14:19,237 --> 03:14:28,717
MATT: "We're prepared now. And we've met around
with the remaining Herd, we've spread the tale of

2913
03:14:28,717 --> 03:14:38,909
"Kevdak's fall. Demanded solidarity under my arms
and yours. And our plan to show our strength and

2914
03:14:38,909 --> 03:14:47,897
"independence from his reign by cutting down the
black dragon of Gatshadow. Many are easily swayed

2915
03:14:47,897 --> 03:14:56,128
"by words of bloodshed and glory. Others, the
hesitation in their eyes worries me. Now

2916
03:14:56,128 --> 03:15:04,735
"Greenbeard had set us down a path of ruin,
coming here. We conquer and move as a people. This

2917
03:15:04,735 --> 03:15:12,215
"life without roaming, lording over a broken city,
living under the thumb of a drake? This is not our

2918
03:15:12,215 --> 03:15:22,160
"life. Since Greenbeard's age and selfishness had
caught up to him, Kevdak's lust for the fear of

2919
03:15:22,160 --> 03:15:30,582
"others swayed his judgment into more
self-indulgent territory. And while we all quelled

2920
03:15:30,582 --> 03:15:38,307
"rebellion, gathered gold and goods, while I
parlayed with that beast, my uncle stayed in

2921
03:15:38,307 --> 03:15:44,963
"here." Points back at the throne behind him.
"Taking his drink and his women, breaking those

2922
03:15:44,963 --> 03:15:54,393
"who could not defend themselves out of idle
boredom. I could see it. Regret. He'd listened to

2923
03:15:54,393 --> 03:16:01,608
"the old man and led us into ruin, but the only
thing stronger than Kevdak's might was his pride.

2924
03:16:01,608 --> 03:16:14,123
"So we stayed. He could not admit he was wrong. He
abandoned reason and foresight. And I questioned

2925
03:16:14,123 --> 03:16:26,982
"him, our actions here in the city. Our future. He
beat me and threw me into chains. So learning from

2926
03:16:26,982 --> 03:16:35,582
"the mistakes, here. When this dragon is done, we
leave. We have no place in this city."

2927
03:16:35,582 --> 03:16:44,535
LAURA: You speak of pride, of listening to reason.
Might be smart to listen to reason in this

2928
03:16:44,535 --> 03:16:54,123
instance as well. That dragon is ancient and very
large. It's quite possible he'll wipe out all of

2929
03:16:54,123 --> 03:17:08,243
us, the town included. It might be smart to
swallow our pride for the day and prepare. Come

2930
03:17:08,243 --> 03:17:13,290
back when we have preparations made and we can
take the dragon down.

2931
03:17:13,290 --> 03:17:26,655
MATT: "Please understand, the dragon has claimed
quite the tithe from our people. We've provided

2932
03:17:26,655 --> 03:17:33,223
"what we can, what we could scavenge, but even then
the coffers of this town that we could acquire are

2933
03:17:33,223 --> 03:17:42,533
"growing thin. The reason that we were preparing
for this attack even before you arrived is because

2934
03:17:42,533 --> 03:17:48,719
"we were at the end of our rope. Many of the people
made away from this town with their goods before

2935
03:17:48,719 --> 03:17:54,780
"we came, and many still have escaped our grasp
when we took over. So the paltry sums that we

2936
03:17:54,780 --> 03:17:59,985
"could gather in the time that we did hold reign
over Westruun-- the dragon is not going to be

2937
03:17:59,985 --> 03:18:07,997
"happy that each package dwindles with each passing
couple of days. Either we take this element of

2938
03:18:07,997 --> 03:18:18,502
"surprise and fight it on our own terms, or we wait
for it to come to us angry, on its. And if we

2939
03:18:18,502 --> 03:18:26,558
"leave now, the Herd may survive. But I haven't
heard of a dragon that when crossed lets that

2940
03:18:26,558 --> 03:18:37,732
"vengeance fly. And I'll be honest with you, we
leave a trail behind us, as you know."

2941
03:18:37,732 --> 03:18:41,828
TRAVIS: That I do. It is a wide wake, my friend.

2942
03:18:41,828 --> 03:18:49,211
MATT: At this point, the door slams open behind
you guys. You see a muscular man walks in, skin

2943
03:18:49,211 --> 03:18:55,248
sun-scarred and calloused, his long, black hair
clustered in wild, unkempt clumps. A wild elf,

2944
03:18:55,248 --> 03:19:01,638
Tress, who accompanied you to the square naught
but earlier the day before walks in behind him.

2945
03:19:01,638 --> 03:19:10,986
"Ivon, your timing is good. We speak on." At which
point this man steps forward to the table, pushing

2946
03:19:10,986 --> 03:19:20,527
you guys aside and looking directly at Zanror. "We
do not recognize you, Zanror. Kevdak was the

2947
03:19:20,527 --> 03:19:27,645
"Thunderlord who conquered the River Maw, and now
he's dead. You take his title unearned and intend

2948
03:19:27,645 --> 03:19:35,796
"to lead us into suicide against a dragon that even
Kevdak feared. We will not stand for this. The

2949
03:19:35,796 --> 03:19:45,265
"River Maw are picking up and leaving. Now. We
return to our fens, to lead our people. You can

2950
03:19:45,265 --> 03:19:55,890
"all die for your own reasons." Zanror leans
forward, very serious, a grave look on his face.

2951
03:19:55,890 --> 03:20:03,155
"Are you saying you're abandoning the Herd?" At
which point you can see there's tension in his

2952
03:20:03,155 --> 03:20:10,163
muscles, and you can see Tress currently reaching
back for a weapon and Ivon, not breaking a sweat,

2953
03:20:10,163 --> 03:20:20,444
leans into his face, square chiseled jaw going,
"Yeah. I guess that's what I'm saying. Herd of

2954
03:20:20,444 --> 03:20:26,514
"Storms is no more if you're going to lead us into
death. We'd rather live on. Back to the lives we

2955
03:20:26,514 --> 03:20:42,310
"had before you came in and mucked it up." "Close
the doors!" Zanror says, and the door shuts behind.

2956
03:20:42,310 --> 03:20:44,053
SAM: Shit.

2957
03:20:44,053 --> 03:20:57,385
MATT: Zanror looks to you. "What do you say, Grog
Strongjaw, slayer of Kevdak, he who raises might

2958
03:20:57,385 --> 03:21:00,447
"against the dragon?"

2959
03:21:00,447 --> 03:21:08,559
TRAVIS: Thunderlord, we back your play.

2960
03:21:08,559 --> 03:21:21,634
MATT: "The rest of you, those who travel this
world afar, outside of our people, where does your

2961
03:21:21,634 --> 03:21:24,632
"allegiance lie?"

2962
03:21:24,632 --> 03:21:30,447
SAM: Well, certainly not with the cowards who're
abandoning you in the face of a tough fight.

2963
03:21:30,447 --> 03:21:37,423
MATT: Ivon turns to you now, eyes red with fury.
"Who're you calling a coward, little man?"

2964
03:21:37,423 --> 03:21:43,507
TRAVIS: Watch where you turn your gaze. It may be
the last movement your head makes attached

2965
03:21:43,507 --> 03:21:44,942
to your body.

2966
03:21:44,942 --> 03:21:46,950
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

2967
03:21:46,950 --> 03:21:52,726
TRAVIS: Oh, that's not good. Ten.

2968
03:21:52,726 --> 03:21:53,865
MATT: Ten.

2969
03:21:53,865 --> 03:21:55,638
SAM: I'm dead.

2970
03:21:55,638 --> 03:22:01,886
MATT: He's still staring at Scanlan. (spits) Spits
right in your face.

2971
03:22:01,886 --> 03:22:04,382
SAM: That's not very nice.

2972
03:22:04,382 --> 03:22:10,294
MATT: "No. It's not. Neither is calling me a
coward."

2973
03:22:10,294 --> 03:22:22,630
SAM: Well, I'm just a guest here, so I don't want
to spill anyone's blood in someone else's throne

2974
03:22:22,630 --> 03:22:26,151
room, so I'll be the bigger man and take a step
back.

2975
03:22:26,151 --> 03:22:35,021
MATT: As you take a step back, he stands back up,
turns to Zanror. "Zanror. Open the door. Let us go

2976
03:22:35,021 --> 03:22:42,152
"live our lives and you can run into whatever
fires you want. The last thing we need is a civil

2977
03:22:42,152 --> 03:22:48,091
"war this morning." What do you say?

2978
03:22:48,091 --> 03:22:50,646
LAURA: How many people do you have with you?

2979
03:22:50,646 --> 03:22:54,130
MATT: Turns to you. "And you are?"

2980
03:22:54,130 --> 03:22:57,052
LAURA: Vex'ahlia.

2981
03:22:57,052 --> 03:23:16,694
MATT: "We take 18 with us, west of the Fens. Let
us be. It's not fair to drag them into this chaos."

2982
03:23:16,694 --> 03:23:37,529
ASHLEY: May I say something? I realize you want to
go and protect your people, but even if you run,

2983
03:23:37,529 --> 03:23:48,785
you guys will eventually come across a dragon that
will kill all of your people. So what if we fight

2984
03:23:48,785 --> 03:23:53,023
together? Because there's strength in numbers.

2985
03:23:53,023 --> 03:23:58,021
SAM: Maybe we should just let them leave.

2986
03:23:58,021 --> 03:24:01,927
MATT: Make a persuasion check. With disadvantage.

2987
03:24:01,927 --> 03:24:03,256
LAURA: Why?

2988
03:24:03,256 --> 03:24:07,413
MATT: Because you're a tiny gnome talking up to a
very burly man who's--

2989
03:24:07,413 --> 03:24:11,407
ASHLEY: Yeah, but I have Gnome Cunning--
charisma--

2990
03:24:11,407 --> 03:24:13,694
MATT: Right. Go ahead and make your roll.

2991
03:24:13,694 --> 03:24:16,243
ASHLEY: So I have advantage on charismas.

2992
03:24:16,243 --> 03:24:18,833
MATT: On charismas?

2993
03:24:18,833 --> 03:24:22,840
(laughter)

2994
03:24:22,840 --> 03:24:24,440
TRAVIS: Pike.

2995
03:24:24,440 --> 03:24:27,005
ASHLEY: I do! Gnome Cunning-- Advantage on all
intelligence, wisdom, and charisma.

2996
03:24:27,005 --> 03:24:28,765
SAM: Saves.

2997
03:24:28,765 --> 03:24:30,427
LAURA: Saving throws.

2998
03:24:30,427 --> 03:24:33,449
ASHLEY: Oh yes, I didn't read the rest of it.

2999
03:24:33,449 --> 03:24:35,836
MATT: Yeah. That's not really going to help with
that, unfortunately.

3000
03:24:35,836 --> 03:24:36,987
ASHLEY: All right, so persuasion?

3001
03:24:36,987 --> 03:24:38,345
MATT: This is persuasion.

3002
03:24:38,345 --> 03:24:49,817
ASHLEY: Little persuashe? All right, that's a 20.
Fuck. Nine? Hah, he laughs.

3003
03:24:49,817 --> 03:24:58,451
MATT: "It's interesting, Zanror, I walk into here
and suddenly all the tiny people are talking for

3004
03:24:58,451 --> 03:25:02,426
"you. Tress, let's go."

3005
03:25:02,426 --> 03:25:05,973
LIAM: I'm a head taller. Talk to me.

3006
03:25:05,973 --> 03:25:09,398
MATT: "I ain't got time for this shit anymore."

3007
03:25:09,398 --> 03:25:19,061
LIAM: Make time. Blade out. Those dragons are
going to find you and me and everyone in this

3008
03:25:19,061 --> 03:25:25,383
room, whether we fight them now or later. The only
stupid thing we can do is separate ourselves from

3009
03:25:25,383 --> 03:25:33,588
each other-- yeah, keep twitching, twitchy. I
don't want to fight this dragon today either, but

3010
03:25:33,588 --> 03:25:40,885
stupider than that is splitting this group of
powerful motherfuckers apart. I'd rather walk away

3011
03:25:40,885 --> 03:25:44,923
from here, I'd rather take everyone out of this
city and build our strength and come back and

3012
03:25:44,923 --> 03:25:52,284
hobble this beast, but the stupidest thing you
could do right now is separate yourself from the

3013
03:25:52,284 --> 03:25:57,806
Herd. You make yourself weaker, you don't have
them to protect you while you're in the fields

3014
03:25:57,806 --> 03:26:06,113
alone while that dragon belches shit on you from
above. You're strong. These fucking guys are

3015
03:26:06,113 --> 03:26:13,629
strong. We need to be smart. Your strength is shit
compared to that dragon. Shit.

3016
03:26:13,629 --> 03:26:18,201
MATT: "And your tiny people are going to do
better?"

3017
03:26:18,201 --> 03:26:21,916
LAURA: Our tiny people are pretty fucking
powerful.

3018
03:26:21,916 --> 03:26:23,751
ASHLEY: We've already killed dragons.

3019
03:26:23,751 --> 03:26:28,240
SAM: I'm getting pretty sick and tired of being
called tiny. Listen, I don't want to--

3020
03:26:28,240 --> 03:26:29,733
MATT: "Killed dragons?"

3021
03:26:29,733 --> 03:26:34,154
ASHLEY: I pull out my necklace with the tooth on
it.

3022
03:26:34,154 --> 03:26:42,516
MATT: "Lemme see that." He pulls it forward and
looks it over. "Can buy that in any caravan that

3023
03:26:42,516 --> 03:26:43,784
"passes through."

3024
03:26:43,784 --> 03:26:45,349
LAURA: We killed a white dragon, motherfucker.

3025
03:26:45,349 --> 03:26:48,297
ASHLEY: I spit at his feet.

3026
03:26:48,297 --> 03:26:53,642
SAM: Oi! Forget it, guys, why are we trying-- Why
are we trying to convince this asshole to fight

3027
03:26:53,642 --> 03:26:56,390
with us? Let's just let him leave, he's a coward.

3028
03:26:56,390 --> 03:27:01,706
MARISHA: Zanror, if he doesn't have your
allegiance in this room, he will not have your

3029
03:27:01,706 --> 03:27:12,810
allegiance on the battlefield, let them go. Only
big men talk big words that only fail on the

3030
03:27:12,810 --> 03:27:21,821
battlefield. He has nothing to represent any of
his claims. Let him go.

3031
03:27:21,821 --> 03:27:26,300
LIAM: The only difference between you and us is
that we want to actually kill this thing. You want

3032
03:27:26,300 --> 03:27:27,612
to be a prick.

3033
03:27:27,612 --> 03:27:35,584
MARISHA: Zanror-- Zanror, it's not worth losing
any of your men before we fight this dragon, just

3034
03:27:35,584 --> 03:27:39,778
let them go. You're already losing 18.

3035
03:27:39,778 --> 03:27:49,924
MATT: "Open the door." The door slowly opens
behind them. "All right, Ivon, you want to leave?

3036
03:27:49,924 --> 03:27:59,012
"Go. Take your people. But you better go now.
Because when we're done cutting that dragon down

3037
03:27:59,012 --> 03:28:11,416
"we're going to come after you. Deserters. Or you
can come to this fight with us. Yes, these

3038
03:28:11,416 --> 03:28:22,887
"dragon-slayers, he who fell from the sky and cut
the uncuttable down-- we will gloriously bathe in

3039
03:28:22,887 --> 03:28:30,978
"the blood of that beast, take back the spoils that
we fed it. You can do what you please. I have no

3040
03:28:30,978 --> 03:28:43,924
"interest in lording over you." Looks about the
rest of you. "I've got your arms at my back for

3041
03:28:43,924 --> 03:28:47,322
"this. Aye?"

3042
03:28:47,322 --> 03:28:50,139
TRAVIS, ASHLEY, and LAURA: Aye.

3043
03:28:50,139 --> 03:29:02,846
MATT: Tress puts her hand to the side. Ivon looks
at her.

3044
03:29:02,846 --> 03:29:11,666
"We'll take our chances with the wild." Turns
around and exits the room.

3045
03:29:11,666 --> 03:29:17,957
ASHLEY: As Ivon starts going out, I want to trip
him. Stick my foot out.

3046
03:29:17,957 --> 03:29:19,651
MARISHA: Oh my god.

3047
03:29:19,651 --> 03:29:21,500
MATT: All right. Okay.

3048
03:29:21,500 --> 03:29:23,769
TRAVIS: Wars have been started over less.

3049
03:29:23,769 --> 03:29:25,846
ASHLEY: It'll probably fail.

3050
03:29:25,846 --> 03:29:31,374
MATT: Go ahead and make a strength check. Plus
four to your roll, is what it'd be.

3051
03:29:31,374 --> 03:29:38,663
ASHLEY: 12.

3052
03:29:38,663 --> 03:29:44,391
MATT: (stumbling) Catches himself. Shoots you a
look.

3053
03:29:44,391 --> 03:29:47,148
ASHLEY: Sorry, I'm so small. You probably just
didn't see me.

3054
03:29:47,148 --> 03:29:51,761
(laughter)

3055
03:29:51,761 --> 03:29:53,621
MATT: They both exit out the door.

3056
03:29:53,621 --> 03:29:56,484
LIAM: Have fun melting in (trails off) acid-- and
they're gone.

3057
03:29:56,484 --> 03:29:57,849
MATT: Door closes.

3058
03:29:57,849 --> 03:29:59,065
ASHLEY: Dick.

3059
03:29:59,065 --> 03:30:04,833
MATT: "Sorry about that. So."

3060
03:30:04,833 --> 03:30:07,347
LAURA: How many do you have left? After they
left.

3061
03:30:07,347 --> 03:30:14,972
MATT: "18... you're looking at about 25 strong.
We have more wounded, but they're not going to be

3062
03:30:14,972 --> 03:30:16,396
"of use in this battle."

3063
03:30:16,396 --> 03:30:17,910
LAURA: 25.

3064
03:30:17,910 --> 03:30:19,799
MATT: "25 strong people."

3065
03:30:19,799 --> 03:30:24,333
SAM: Does that include your wife?

3066
03:30:24,333 --> 03:30:30,143
MATT:: "No, she's not--" And she turns around and
goes, "I will fight in this. You are not going to

3067
03:30:30,143 --> 03:30:45,791
"keep me from glory." He goes, "She will fight with
us."

3068
03:30:45,791 --> 03:30:54,794
TRAVIS: Aye, she will. 25 strong we have. Injured
are no good to us. Neither are the prisoners or

3069
03:30:54,794 --> 03:31:01,443
hostages that were kept by this herd. You said you
have made preparations. What sort of preparations

3070
03:31:01,443 --> 03:31:03,938
do you have in mind?

3071
03:31:03,938 --> 03:31:15,888
MATT: "Well, the creature sleeps at the top of
Gatshadow. We've acquired an ally in this city

3072
03:31:15,888 --> 03:31:22,744
"that seems to know a secret byway to get to the
side of that cavern. I figure that way we can go

3073
03:31:22,744 --> 03:31:26,879
"ahead and take the fight to it where it sleeps,
when it's not ready."

3074
03:31:26,879 --> 03:31:30,017
TRAVIS: Interesting.

3075
03:31:30,017 --> 03:31:33,791
MATT: "Can't fly if it's stuck in a cave."

3076
03:31:33,791 --> 03:31:37,350
TRAVIS: Very true. Have you seen this cave?

3077
03:31:37,350 --> 03:31:43,039
MATT: "Only from afar, but we have some scouts
that are making their way there right now."

3078
03:31:43,039 --> 03:31:47,276
TRAVIS: Might report back with how-- the size of
the cave.

3079
03:31:47,276 --> 03:31:49,680
MATT: "Should know soon."

3080
03:31:49,680 --> 03:31:55,925
MARISHA: If I'm not mistaken, I recall hearing
that no scouts that have been sent thus far have

3081
03:31:55,925 --> 03:31:57,824
returned, is that correct?

3082
03:31:57,824 --> 03:31:59,287
MATT: "That is correct."

3083
03:31:59,287 --> 03:32:02,570
MARISHA: And you have faith that these that you
sent will?

3084
03:32:02,570 --> 03:32:04,979
MATT: "It's better than not."

3085
03:32:04,979 --> 03:32:12,875
TRAVIS: Do you have any interest in a tactical
ambush?

3086
03:32:12,875 --> 03:32:17,952
MATT: "I'm all ears. What have you got?"

3087
03:32:17,952 --> 03:32:21,323
MARISHA: When's it due for its next pickup?

3088
03:32:21,323 --> 03:32:26,321
MATT: "Tomorrow morning, just after dawn."

3089
03:32:26,321 --> 03:32:36,389
MARISHA: Wait 24 hours, Pike and I can take time,
and Scanlan, to heal some of your wounded, gain a

3090
03:32:36,389 --> 03:32:40,266
couple more to the fight. We set a trap in the
morning.

3091
03:32:40,266 --> 03:32:42,210
MATT: "What kind of trap?"

3092
03:32:42,210 --> 03:32:44,410
LAURA: Something that explodes it?

3093
03:32:44,410 --> 03:32:45,773
MARISHA: Something big.

3094
03:32:45,773 --> 03:32:47,125
LAURA: Something that traps it?

3095
03:32:47,125 --> 03:32:48,401
MARISHA: Something heavy.

3096
03:32:48,401 --> 03:32:56,340
TALIESIN: Something, even in theory, that we could
convince it to take back to its lair. If we still

3097
03:32:56,340 --> 03:33:02,691
wanted to go with that, we could load the next
parcel with something--

3098
03:33:02,691 --> 03:33:04,441
SAM: Or someone.

3099
03:33:04,441 --> 03:33:06,584
LIAM: Would three days be better than one, Percival?

3100
03:33:06,584 --> 03:33:10,922
TALIESIN: A month would be better than a week--

3101
03:33:10,922 --> 03:33:12,933
TRAVIS: Don't have that. One thing dragons--

3102
03:33:12,933 --> 03:33:14,333
TALIESIN: Yes, three days would always be better
than one.

3103
03:33:14,333 --> 03:33:21,556
TRAVIS: Dragons and Kevdak shared one common
trait: arrogance. In your previous dealings with

3104
03:33:21,556 --> 03:33:26,143
this dragon, did it ever speak down to you?

3105
03:33:26,143 --> 03:33:36,478
MATT: "Huh. That's the only way it knows how to
speak. Fucking cold-minded beast."

3106
03:33:36,478 --> 03:33:38,083
TRAVIS: Aye.

3107
03:33:38,083 --> 03:33:40,449
MATT: "Can't wait to sever its head from its
neck."

3108
03:33:40,449 --> 03:33:47,952
TRAVIS: Perhaps if we tame your lust for blood for
a day, we can control all the variables that we

3109
03:33:47,952 --> 03:33:56,203
have by setting this trap. If we go to that cave,
aye, we will find war sooner, but we know less,

3110
03:33:56,203 --> 03:34:02,444
and the reason you're the Thunderlord now is there
is a better brain in that skull than there ever

3111
03:34:02,444 --> 03:34:06,859
was in your father's. Let's use that to our
advantage.

3112
03:34:06,859 --> 03:34:12,845
MATT: Make a persuasion check. Does anyone want to
aid?

3113
03:34:12,845 --> 03:34:14,516
TRAVIS: Don't need it.

3114
03:34:14,516 --> 03:34:16,513
LAURA: (sings) He doesn't need it.

3115
03:34:16,513 --> 03:34:18,696
TRAVIS: 19.

3116
03:34:18,696 --> 03:34:22,251
SAM: He might need it.

3117
03:34:22,251 --> 03:34:36,101
MATT: Takes a moment. "We'll take your day. Set
what you need. We'll go ahead and call the troops

3118
03:34:36,101 --> 03:34:46,562
"off for the day. Heal our wounded. Let's make this
such a majestic death for this terrible creature."

3119
03:34:46,562 --> 03:34:55,768
MARISHA: Zanror-- I think Percy just had an idea,
but Vex'ahlia knows a lot about dragons. She might

3120
03:34:55,768 --> 03:35:01,669
be good to educate the troops. Also, as Grog
mentioned, we have people who could be very

3121
03:35:01,669 --> 03:35:06,063
valuable allies that your people have imprisoned.
It would behoove you to release them so that they

3122
03:35:06,063 --> 03:35:13,502
can join our side. Conversely, any other type of
magical enhancements that you can use to arm

3123
03:35:13,502 --> 03:35:15,387
against acid?

3124
03:35:15,387 --> 03:35:16,472
LAURA: Acid.

3125
03:35:16,472 --> 03:35:22,205
MARISHA: For any and all of your troops, it's
definitely suggested.

3126
03:35:22,205 --> 03:35:27,401
MATT: "I'll talk to our Speakers. They should be
able to mount what they can. Acid, you say?"

3127
03:35:27,401 --> 03:35:28,524
LAURA: Yes.

3128
03:35:28,524 --> 03:35:30,509
MATT: "Okay. We'll do that."

3129
03:35:30,509 --> 03:35:31,764
LAURA: You'll release the prisoners?

3130
03:35:31,764 --> 03:35:40,315
MATT: "Would like one of you to at least go with
them, but aye, we can do that. All right. Let's

3131
03:35:40,315 --> 03:35:44,565
"begin our planning, for tomorrow we kill a
dragon."

3132
03:35:44,565 --> 03:35:46,326
LAURA: We totally planned at dawn!

3133
03:35:46,326 --> 03:35:48,903
(laughter)

3134
03:35:48,903 --> 03:35:50,765
SAM: Episode title!

3135
03:35:50,765 --> 03:35:55,713
MATT: And on that note we're going to end
tonight's episode. Pick this up next week.

3136
03:35:55,713 --> 03:35:57,093
TRAVIS: Planned at dawn.

3137
03:35:57,093 --> 03:35:58,519
MATT: You totally did!

3138
03:35:58,519 --> 03:35:59,509
TRAVIS: See?

3139
03:35:59,509 --> 03:36:00,969
(laughter)

3140
03:36:00,969 --> 03:36:02,061
ASHLEY: At dawn, we plan.

3141
03:36:02,061 --> 03:36:06,517
TALIESIN: Have fun you guys, I'll be on a beach
next week, but-- it's okay, I'll be, I'll try--

3142
03:36:06,517 --> 03:36:08,725
LIAM: Where're you going, brainiac?

3143
03:36:08,725 --> 03:36:10,869
TALIESIN: To Hawaii.

3144
03:36:10,869 --> 03:36:12,051
MATT: We can Skype you in.

3145
03:36:12,051 --> 03:36:17,784
TALIESIN: I can Skype in. I'll try and Skype in.
I'll see how much internet I can get on the island.

3146
03:36:17,784 --> 03:36:19,555
MATT: Oh. Wait, what?

3147
03:36:19,555 --> 03:36:24,282
SAM: Barack is here?

3148
03:36:24,282 --> 03:36:28,634
MATT: Is it open? All right guys, the Geek and
Sundry open beta is next week!

3149
03:36:28,634 --> 03:36:29,824
SAM: What's that mean?

3150
03:36:29,824 --> 03:36:36,347
MATT: We'll be hosting, oh, Talking Heads, awesome
new shows every day, a bunch of new shows we'll be

3151
03:36:36,347 --> 03:36:37,869
trying out from up here on the channel.

3152
03:36:37,869 --> 03:36:40,025
LAURA: Oh, shit! It's like pilot season.

3153
03:36:40,025 --> 03:36:45,282
MATT: Essentially, yeah. We'll be throwing a bunch
of cool stuff up. Be every day at looks like 5:00

3156
03:36:54,833 --> 03:37:02,716

again, thank you, Loot Crate, for being our sponsor.

3157
03:37:02,716 --> 03:37:04,453
ALL: Yay!

3158
03:37:04,453 --> 03:37:09,523
MATT: It's been awesome to have an official
sponsor for once.

3159
03:37:09,523 --> 03:37:14,290
MARISHA: It's like it's a real
thing now.

3160
03:37:14,290 --> 03:37:21,275
MATT: I know, it's weird. Yeah. So once again, you
can go to www.lootcrate.com/criticalrole, put in

3161
03:37:21,275 --> 03:37:25,067

things are going to happen.

3163
03:37:29,368 --> 03:37:30,618
LAURA: Oh god.

3164
03:37:30,618 --> 03:37:36,921
MATT: So. All right, guys. Is it Thursday yet?
Good night.
