00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.027
[music]

00:00:13.027 --> 00:00:22.158
(cheering)

00:00:22.158 --> 00:00:23.654
MATT: Why do I always get the podium?

00:00:23.654 --> 00:00:26.037
(laughter)

00:00:26.037 --> 00:00:29.129
MATT: I'm separate from you guys enough for the
actual game, so I now have to do it onstage as

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:30.058
well. It's great.

00:00:33.238 --> 00:00:34.139
LAURA: You're so good at it!

00:00:34.139 --> 00:00:37.220
ORGANIZER: Mr. Mercer? You can move it!

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.288
MATT: I can move it.

00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:39.348
LAURA: Sit down!

00:00:39.348 --> 00:00:40.936
MATT: Can I move this one?

00:00:40.936 --> 00:00:42.927
MARISHA: Should we all move down?

00:00:43.247 --> 00:00:44.787
MATT: I want to be part of--

00:00:44.787 --> 00:00:46.476
TALIESIN: There actually is another microphone.

00:00:46.476 --> 00:00:48.387
LAURA: Make sure you stay really far away from us,
okay?

00:00:48.387 --> 00:00:50.998
MATT: I'm going to go to the other microphone. I
feel so formal and separate.

00:00:50.998 --> 00:00:55.677
TRAVIS: "Please be aware that many members of your
audience may be 18 years of age or under."

00:00:56.427 --> 00:00:57.319
LAURA: Is that true?

00:00:57.319 --> 00:01:01.718
(shouting)

00:01:01.718 --> 00:01:03.688
TALIESIN: Put your hand down, young man!

00:01:03.688 --> 00:01:05.356
(laughter)

00:01:05.356 --> 00:01:06.736
TRAVIS: That's with a beard!

00:01:06.736 --> 00:01:12.857
MATT: Thank you all for attending the aluminum
siding sales convention of 2016 here in Vegas. I'm

00:01:12.857 --> 00:01:13.947
going to move here.

00:01:13.947 --> 00:01:18.236
(cheering)

00:01:18.236 --> 00:01:20.367
MARISHA: Welcome to the table.

00:01:21.107 --> 00:01:26.463
MATT: It feels so different from this side. Well,
hey guys! Thank you so much for coming to our

00:01:26.463 --> 00:01:29.646
Friday afternoon WonderCon Critical Role panel.

00:01:29.646 --> 00:01:36.961
(cheering)

00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:40.330
MATT: I think we're all legitimately excited and
surprised that on a Friday afternoon we've had

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:46.493
people show up. This is awesome. Thank you all so
much. Let's go ahead and start with some

00:01:46.493 --> 00:01:46.822
introductions.

00:01:46.822 --> 00:01:48.351
LAURA: I see some really wonderful shirts in the
audience.

00:01:51.161 --> 00:01:52.461
MARISHA: Grog's shirt's over there.

00:01:57.141 --> 00:01:58.161
TALIESIN: I told you they've sold one.

00:02:03.681 --> 00:02:05.166
TRAVIS: Go buy all the shirts!

00:02:07.935 --> 00:02:10.583
MATT: Here, let's go into introductions around the
table for the folks in the audience that are

00:02:10.583 --> 00:02:13.794
really confused as to why they're here and don't
know what's going on. Travis!

00:02:13.794 --> 00:02:15.264
TRAVIS: Oh! What?

00:02:15.264 --> 00:02:16.925
MATT: Who are you? What do you do?

00:02:16.925 --> 00:02:25.745
TRAVIS: (as Grog) Who is that talking? Hmm. I'm
Travis Willingham. I play Grog on Critical Role.

00:02:26.125 --> 00:02:35.096
I'm a goliath barbarian. I like ale and killing
things.

00:02:35.096 --> 00:02:42.833
MATT: (creepily) Yes, kill all the things.
(normal) Yeah, if you want to? What have you

00:02:42.833 --> 00:02:43.736
voiced recently?

00:02:43.736 --> 00:02:53.075
TRAVIS: Oh god, I voice stuff? I'm Thor in
Avengers Assemble, Fred 104 in Halo 5: Guardians,

00:02:53.075 --> 00:02:56.106
and I'm King Roland in Princess Sofia the First.

00:02:56.106 --> 00:03:08.525
LAURA: With the adorable Trinket. I don't know.
Poke-Trinket. I choose you Trinket-chu! I'm a

00:03:08.525 --> 00:03:17.647
voice actress as well, and I have recently done
Halo 5 as Olympia Vale. Uncharted 4 is coming out

00:03:17.647 --> 00:03:24.586
soon. I play Nadine Ross. Gears of War 4 is coming
out soon, I play Kait in that, which I'm pretty

00:03:24.586 --> 00:03:25.396
excited about.

00:03:25.396 --> 00:03:26.627
MARISHA: Everything with four in it.

00:03:26.627 --> 00:03:34.666
LAURA: All the fours! Saint's Row 4, President of
the United States, Street Fighter IV, Chun Li.

00:03:34.666 --> 00:03:48.474
TALIESIN: Yeah. My name is Taliesin Jaffe, and I
play Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski

00:03:48.474 --> 00:03:57.276
de Rolo III, the token human, gunslinger, and mad
scientist of the group. You can most recently hear

00:03:57.276 --> 00:04:07.184
me, "I can be your robot buddy" in Fallout 4. I've
also done Street Fighter 4 and other things. I

00:04:07.184 --> 00:04:10.966
don't know. I'm tired. I've been here all day.
It's been a long day.

00:04:10.966 --> 00:04:23.856
MARISHA: Hello! I am Marisha Ray, AKA Keyleth the
half-elven druid who everyone either loves or

00:04:23.856 --> 00:04:35.905
hates or you love to hate. You can hear me as
Margaret in the Persona franchise and Metal Gear

00:04:35.905 --> 00:04:39.564
Solid: The Phantom Pain-- also a four-- no, that's
a five.

00:04:39.564 --> 00:04:40.866
LAURA: Lame!

00:04:40.866 --> 00:04:44.907
TALIESIN: You have a web series now too.

00:04:44.907 --> 00:04:55.576
MARISHA: Signal Boost is out right now on the Geek
&amp; Sundry network. I'm hosting, and we have a new

00:04:55.576 --> 00:05:02.785
host coming up soon. I love it. It's become my
baby. It's nice. It's fun. It's irreverent. It's

00:05:02.785 --> 00:05:12.734
weird. If you don't get it, you won't get it.
There's been a lot of work gone into that series,

00:05:12.734 --> 00:05:14.747
okay? A lot of sleepless nights.

00:05:14.747 --> 00:05:17.316
MATT: It screams at 4 AM, does the whole thing.

00:05:19.296 --> 00:05:22.870
MARISHA: Not breastfeeding in public so don't ask,
it's fine.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:37.541
MATT: On that note-- Hi everyone again! I'm
Matthew Mercer. I'm the guy that doesn't sleep any

00:05:37.541 --> 00:05:44.044
more. Dungeon Master for Critical Role. As far as
voice over goes, Leon Kennedy, Resident Evil.

00:05:44.044 --> 00:05:52.876
MacCready in Fallout 4, now with this gentleman
here. Wolf and Kindred and Gangplank in League of

00:05:52.876 --> 00:06:03.537
Legends. Bunch of other stuff right now-- Robin in
Arkham Nights. Off the top of my head, I'm really

00:06:03.537 --> 00:06:10.905
bad at this. You understand! Ryoma, Sugar Ray,
Azama in Fire Emblem Fates which just came out

00:06:10.905 --> 00:06:20.346
recently. But anyways, this panel is about
Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy ass voice

00:06:20.346 --> 00:06:24.954
actors roll dice and play D&amp;D. If you haven't
gotten sick of me saying that phrase by now, you

00:06:24.954 --> 00:06:26.369
will in time, I assure you.

00:06:27.119 --> 00:06:31.103
TRAVIS: Much love to the people on the far left
and the far right side of the room, because every

00:06:31.103 --> 00:06:38.214
time I look over there, I feel like we're doing
something wrong because they're all like-- There's

00:06:38.214 --> 00:06:43.624
really no other way to sit. Love you, right side
of the room, love you.

00:06:43.624 --> 00:06:44.935
MATT: You guys are awesome!

00:06:44.935 --> 00:06:47.105
TRAVIS: Love you too, less populated left side of
the room.

00:06:49.885 --> 00:06:54.086
MARISHA: That was so Bon Jovi of you, "Yeah right
side of the stage!"

00:06:54.086 --> 00:07:00.286
TRAVIS: Yeah right side! Need a beach ball.

00:07:01.656 --> 00:07:04.545
LAURA: Aw man, we need to bring a beach ball to
these things.

00:07:04.545 --> 00:07:05.285
TALIESIN: Next time.

00:07:05.285 --> 00:07:07.503
TRAVIS: Just saying, I got all sorts of great
ideas.

00:07:07.503 --> 00:07:10.786
MATT: Beach ball's nothing, man. I want to Wayne
Coyne this from the Flaming Lips and get inside a

00:07:10.786 --> 00:07:15.739
giant ball and roll out through the audience, like
the efreet did last time.

00:07:15.739 --> 00:07:21.751
TALIESIN: Actually, a fan-- I'm sure they're in
the crowd-- gave me a great idea for a free

00:07:21.751 --> 00:07:26.076
giveaway that we should carry around with us at
cons from now on, which is a free inspiration

00:07:26.076 --> 00:07:31.525
dice. You could go to your DM and say "I have a
free inspiration dice."

00:07:31.525 --> 00:07:39.966
(cheering)

00:07:39.966 --> 00:07:42.106
MATT: We're going to have to bulk order some d10s
then.

00:07:42.106 --> 00:07:48.795
TALIESIN: Right after I met you. Hi, April! It was
a room full of people I vaguely recognize from today.

00:07:48.795 --> 00:07:50.995
TRAVIS: Are we going to do a Q&amp;A?

00:07:50.995 --> 00:07:54.036
MATT: Yeah, let's Q&amp;A this. Taliesin, lead us in.

00:07:54.036 --> 00:07:54.557
TALIESIN: Ah!

00:07:54.557 --> 00:07:57.134
MARISHA: There are mic runners.

00:07:59.224 --> 00:08:03.756
MATT: We have two mics over here at the front of
the stage. If you have a question-- Do you want

00:08:03.756 --> 00:08:07.767
them to line up, or are you going to go to them?
All right, if you have a question, go ahead and

00:08:07.767 --> 00:08:14.746
line up in the two alleys before the two
individuals holding up microphones right now.

00:08:14.746 --> 00:08:16.154
We'll take questions back and forth and try to get
to as many as we can.

00:08:16.154 --> 00:08:22.205
[inaudible]

00:08:22.205 --> 00:08:24.047
MATT: All right, who wishes to wield the first
question?

00:08:24.047 --> 00:08:31.290
[inaudible]

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:32.165
LAURA: Roll a d20.

00:08:32.165 --> 00:08:36.475
MARISHA: What are we talking about?

00:08:36.475 --> 00:08:39.962
TRAVIS: All right, pick a number between--

00:08:39.962 --> 00:08:43.429
MARISHA: Oh that's right we have a ring. I have my
ring on me.

00:08:43.429 --> 00:08:45.436
MATT: Oh, we're having a roll off here! I'm so
excited.

00:08:45.436 --> 00:08:51.734
[inaudible]

00:08:51.734 --> 00:08:52.956
AUDIENCE MEMBER: With inspiration though?

00:08:52.956 --> 00:08:54.425
MATT: Pick a number!

00:08:54.425 --> 00:09:00.575
[inaudible]

00:09:00.575 --> 00:09:04.393
MATT: After the panel we will be finding a way to
roll dice, guys. Which, to be fair, is the most

00:09:04.393 --> 00:09:06.806
D&amp;D thing we could do for this panel.

00:09:08.296 --> 00:09:09.025
TRAVIS: 14!

00:09:09.025 --> 00:09:14.488
MATT: 14, okay so we're starting this side, but
we'll come back to you. All right, sir! You there

00:09:14.488 --> 00:09:16.037
with the wondrous man-bun.

00:09:16.037 --> 00:09:23.865
ORGANIZER: Excuse me. If the people on this side--
[inaudible]

00:09:23.865 --> 00:09:29.636
MATT: All right, rearranging. That's a good idea.
One line that way so we don't block anyone's view

00:09:29.636 --> 00:09:30.566
of the panel.

00:09:30.566 --> 00:09:31.784
MARISHA: Line physics.

00:09:34.324 --> 00:09:44.705
MATT: Big ups to our event organizers over there.
Thank you guys, the volunteers! All right, enough

00:09:44.705 --> 00:09:45.926
dilly-dally, question!

00:09:45.926 --> 00:09:52.018
AUDIENCE MEMBER: For a year, you guys have been
sitting in the same position. I was wondering, are

00:09:52.018 --> 00:09:57.814
you guys tired of sitting in the exact same
position and you want to move? Did you move at home?

00:09:57.814 --> 00:10:03.164
LAURA: I never want to move, ever. When we would
play at home, I would always sit in the same spot

00:10:03.164 --> 00:10:05.836
at home. It feels weird to switch.

00:10:05.836 --> 00:10:07.264
MARISHA: Laura hates change.

00:10:07.264 --> 00:10:10.742
LAURA: I don't like change. I'm a little OCD about
it.

00:10:11.452 --> 00:10:16.067
TALIESIN: Everybody's fine where they're sitting,
except for Marisha, who insisted that she no

00:10:16.067 --> 00:10:23.055
longer sit next to Sam, because of reasons I'm not
allowed to discuss. Although, now I understand,

00:10:23.055 --> 00:10:24.706
because I have to sit next to Sam.

00:10:24.706 --> 00:10:26.006
MARISHA: It's fine, I'll take this burden.

00:10:26.006 --> 00:10:27.676
TALIESIN: He smells of children.

00:10:29.936 --> 00:10:34.247
LAURA: Let's be honest. The reason they moved is
so they could stare into each other's eyes. Liam

00:10:34.247 --> 00:10:37.664
and Marisha wanted to stare at each other without
anybody in between them.

00:10:37.664 --> 00:10:39.153
AUDIENCE: Aw!

00:10:39.153 --> 00:10:40.238
TRAVIS and LAURA: (retching)

00:10:40.238 --> 00:10:43.004
MARISHA: It was nice mixing it up because we got
different dynamics when we sat next to other

00:10:43.004 --> 00:10:50.733
people. I just want to say, I think Team Right
Side of the Table is more progressive, and we like

00:10:50.733 --> 00:10:55.056
switching it up every once in a while. That's all
I'm saying.

00:10:55.056 --> 00:10:57.907
TRAVIS: That's like saying Team Left Side doesn't
understand what that word means.

00:10:57.907 --> 00:11:05.488
(cheering)

00:11:05.488 --> 00:11:07.096
MARISHA: Does that answer your question?

00:11:07.096 --> 00:11:07.583
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I guess.

00:11:07.583 --> 00:11:08.816
MARISHA: Good. That side!

00:11:08.816 --> 00:11:10.355
MATT: Hello!

00:11:10.355 --> 00:11:15.485
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hey, how are you doing? I
recently over the past couple months started

00:11:15.485 --> 00:11:21.125
watching, and it's been really awesome and
rekindled all of my interest in D&amp;D. The thing

00:11:21.125 --> 00:11:26.679
that I really wanted to say is: it's really
awesome, the charities that you guys support, and

00:11:26.679 --> 00:11:36.296
being an aspiring teacher and 826LA-- It's really
awesome to see all the love for that you guys

00:11:36.296 --> 00:11:43.476
show, and that you guys show by helping out with
that, so I wanted to say thank you for all that.

00:11:43.476 --> 00:11:50.006
(cheering)

00:11:50.006 --> 00:11:53.706
MATT: I think it's safe to say that each one of us
at some point in our life has had one person that,

00:11:53.723 --> 00:11:56.526
out of the goodness of their heart, stepped
forward and helped us with something, and changed

00:11:56.526 --> 00:12:05.815
the course of our life, and I think so many
groups, so many charities, so many-- I want to say

00:12:05.815 --> 00:12:10.016
conclaves, but that has a whole different context
in this place-- groups of individuals strive to

00:12:10.016 --> 00:12:16.476
provide that to larger groups, and it's wonderful
to see that those are out there, and you want to

00:12:16.476 --> 00:12:22.235
try to bring that to attention, but the applause
goes to all of you guys, the community that have

00:12:22.235 --> 00:12:27.766
adopted all of these wonderful charities and
lifted them up and given what you could, even many

00:12:27.766 --> 00:12:33.628
of you who couldn't, and seeing that type of
feedback in the community has been incredible,

00:12:33.628 --> 00:12:39.025
humbling, and more than once has brought a tear to
our eye. That's why I like to bring tears to

00:12:39.025 --> 00:12:41.527
yours. It's vengeance.

00:12:42.997 --> 00:12:45.865
AUDIENCE MEMBER: --the panel. How do you-- Sorry!

00:12:45.865 --> 00:12:47.855
TALIESIN: It's been a while.

00:12:47.855 --> 00:12:52.767
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I want to learn how to DM, but
how do you come up with all your NPCs, especially

00:12:52.767 --> 00:12:57.077
on the spot? How do you make them interesting, and
how do you make them not so bland?

00:12:57.095 --> 00:13:04.467
MATT: It helps to be crazy. Especially for the
ones that come off the top of your head, a trick

00:13:04.467 --> 00:13:11.757
that I recommend is having a printout somewhere in
your notes of a series of names, male and female.

00:13:11.757 --> 00:13:19.096
It can be as mundane as you want them to be. They
can be as fantasy-driven as you want them to be.

00:13:19.096 --> 00:13:22.206
There's a lot of weird websites out there that
have fantasy name lists and--

00:13:22.206 --> 00:13:23.667
MARISHA: Purvon.

00:13:23.667 --> 00:13:25.477
TALIESIN: Purvon. We were all sitting here
going--

00:13:25.477 --> 00:13:31.837
MATT: It's a real name, you guys! Oh man, I can't
wait until Purvon shows up and TPKs the whole

00:13:31.837 --> 00:13:35.267
party. Sweet, sweet vengeance.

00:13:35.267 --> 00:13:36.641
TRAVIS: Say my name!

00:13:36.641 --> 00:13:40.397
(laughter)

00:13:41.667 --> 00:13:43.772
TALIESIN: Casting Bad Touch at 4th level.

00:13:43.772 --> 00:13:49.067
(laughter)

00:13:49.957 --> 00:13:54.256
MATT: You can look up names from different
backgrounds, look up ancient Norse names, things

00:13:54.256 --> 00:13:57.976
like that. Those are cool things to pull from, and
have that so when somebody goes, "That little

00:13:57.976 --> 00:14:01.854
"boarded-up shop you talked about? I'm going
to go ahead and break into it, because I hear

00:14:01.873 --> 00:14:08.661
"someone moving in there." You're like, "You
find... Stevran." From there, you can have notes

00:14:08.661 --> 00:14:12.376
of various traits, too. You can make a list of
personality traits and randomly pick them as you

00:14:12.376 --> 00:14:22.369
see it. "He seems a bit agitated by your purple
shirt." That's already a step better than nothing,

00:14:22.369 --> 00:14:28.256
you know? Getting used to making those strong
choices very quickly-- There's no real key or

00:14:28.256 --> 00:14:31.736
cheat sheet to it, as much as it comes with
experience, but any notes that you have at the

00:14:31.736 --> 00:14:34.381
ready will help you be more comfortable with
making those quick decisions over time.

00:14:34.381 --> 00:14:38.365
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you. Also, I have drawings
to give you guys.

00:14:39.115 --> 00:14:40.867
TRAVIS: Aw yeah! Come give us stuff!

00:14:40.867 --> 00:14:42.143
AUDIENCE MEMBER: After the panel.

00:14:42.143 --> 00:14:50.685
MATT: Okay, after the panel. Hello!

00:14:50.685 --> 00:14:55.835
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hello! I'd like to thank you all
for sharing your game with us, because it's

00:14:55.835 --> 00:15:03.337
totally awesome. You can tell that you guys are
friendly, and like each other in the game, and

00:15:03.337 --> 00:15:10.885
that's not something you see in a lot of things,
so thank you! My question is-- well, I have two

00:15:10.885 --> 00:15:18.373
questions. One is I need Kima's stats, because
she's awesome, and really, she either gets frozen

00:15:18.373 --> 00:15:19.887
or thrown into a pit.

00:15:19.887 --> 00:15:21.762
MATT: She's got some bad luck, man!

00:15:23.402 --> 00:15:26.625
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I've been looking for her stats
since she first showed up, so I need her stats.

00:15:26.625 --> 00:15:28.854
And a question from my sister--

00:15:28.854 --> 00:15:31.118
(muffled laughing)

00:15:31.118 --> 00:15:32.427
LAURA: Your sister is so funny!

00:15:32.427 --> 00:15:35.605
(laughter)

00:15:36.625 --> 00:15:42.337
AUDIENCE MEMBER: In Trinket's voice, could you
tell us how he felt when he saw what happened to

00:15:42.337 --> 00:15:44.726
Vax? Or, Vex, I'm sorry!

00:15:44.726 --> 00:15:46.556
MATT: It happens to all of us, it's ok.

00:15:46.556 --> 00:15:50.066
LAURA: (crying)

00:15:50.066 --> 00:15:52.018
AUDIENCE MEMBER: That's pretty sad!

00:15:52.018 --> 00:15:53.697
LAURA: No, I don't want to hear it!

00:15:53.697 --> 00:16:05.108
MATT: (distressed bear noises)

00:16:05.127 --> 00:16:12.827
(cheering)

00:16:12.862 --> 00:16:17.276
TALIESIN: Bear poetry, that was bear poetry!

00:16:17.276 --> 00:16:20.187
MATT: Now jump into my necklace! (whooshing)

00:16:21.887 --> 00:16:23.998
LAURA: (whispering) Now you're trapped forever!

00:16:23.998 --> 00:16:25.356
MATT: Hello!

00:16:25.356 --> 00:16:27.737
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi, thank you guys so much for
coming out here--

00:16:27.737 --> 00:16:29.367
TRAVIS: I love your shirt!

00:16:32.367 --> 00:16:36.906
AUDIENCE MEMBER: My question was have you ever
been in a campaign you didn't like, or played as a

00:16:36.906 --> 00:16:42.572
character that you hated, and you're like, "I want
to die." You know what I mean? Any campaign you

00:16:42.572 --> 00:16:44.312
wish you weren't a part of?

00:16:44.312 --> 00:16:46.272
TRAVIS: This is my only campaign.

00:16:46.272 --> 00:16:48.731
MATT: Well, you played a few one-shots, too.

00:16:48.731 --> 00:16:50.191
TRAVIS: Oh, that's true.

00:16:50.191 --> 00:16:51.803
TALIESIN: As a teenager.

00:16:53.433 --> 00:16:59.353
MARISHA: My first experience with a druid in
fourth edition D&amp;D. I hated it. I hated druids so

00:16:59.353 --> 00:17:08.681
much. I was like, "They're useless, sort of good
at nothing." When I did a druid for this game I

00:17:08.681 --> 00:17:11.195
was like, "All right, I'll give you one last
shot."

00:17:11.195 --> 00:17:14.855
MATT: It worked out okay.

00:17:14.855 --> 00:17:17.861
MARISHA: It worked out great! Yeah. Three years
later.

00:17:17.861 --> 00:17:21.631
MATT: One-shotting fire elementals in the battle.

00:17:21.631 --> 00:17:23.283
MARISHA: (whooshing)

00:17:23.283 --> 00:17:25.542
(applause)

00:17:25.542 --> 00:17:27.307
MATT: That was ridiculous.

00:17:27.307 --> 00:17:28.431
MARISHA: Thanks.

00:17:28.431 --> 00:17:29.758
TRAVIS: You're totally useful now.

00:17:29.758 --> 00:17:31.301
MARISHA: Thanks.

00:17:33.711 --> 00:17:36.204
MATT: Marisha will remember that.

00:17:36.204 --> 00:17:42.931
(laughter)

00:17:42.931 --> 00:17:45.342
TRAVIS: (Grog voice) Keyleth, help me!

00:17:45.342 --> 00:17:48.202
MARISHA: Well--

00:17:48.202 --> 00:17:52.285
TALIESIN: Occasionally in high school, I'd play
and be like, "Oh, I chose poorly." These were some

00:17:52.285 --> 00:17:59.162
bad character trait decisions. Then you let that
character get killed. Go out guns blazing, and you

00:17:59.162 --> 00:18:03.452
a roll a new one and everybody's happy. Except
that character.

00:18:05.182 --> 00:18:11.424
MATT: I remember I made a Dawn Cast in an Exalted
game for a while that was really cool on paper. I

00:18:11.424 --> 00:18:15.581
liked the idea and the theme behind it, but then
when I realized partway into the campaign there was

00:18:15.581 --> 00:18:20.421
going to be a lot of social combat and I had
<i>nothing</i> except a giant Final Fantasy-size sword,

00:18:20.421 --> 00:18:30.472
and that's about it, I spent a lot of the game
going, "Are there <i>hors d'oeuvres</i>?" I regretted

00:18:30.472 --> 00:18:36.101
that choice a little bit. Other than that, you
find something weird about the character and if

00:18:36.101 --> 00:18:38.684
you don't like it, have them jump off a cliff.

00:18:41.154 --> 00:18:41.820
TALIESIN: Heroically.

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:44.465
MATT: Thank you, good question!

00:18:44.465 --> 00:18:46.150
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I have drawings, too!

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:49.226
MATT: You guys are ridiculous!

00:18:49.226 --> 00:18:51.070
AUDIENCE MEMBER: After the panel, outside in the
hall.

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:55.302
MATT: We'll have a little drop point. Thank you!

00:18:56.942 --> 00:19:01.299
MARISHA: Or you can hand them to Claudia. Everyone
say "Hi, Claudia."

00:19:01.299 --> 00:19:03.559
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Out in the exit, after the
panel.

00:19:03.559 --> 00:19:05.652
MATT: You, sir, with the fantastic t-shirt.

00:19:05.652 --> 00:19:11.712
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you. I have a question for
the players and DM. Players, how often do you

00:19:11.712 --> 00:19:20.232
think about your character and the mindset of your
character? How involved do you get? For the DM,

00:19:20.232 --> 00:19:27.696
how do you control this? There's so many people,
and you're dealing with Scanlan.

00:19:27.711 --> 00:19:34.451
(laughter)

00:19:34.451 --> 00:19:38.779
MARISHA: I love that your question was basically,
"They're insane; how do you manage it?"

00:19:38.779 --> 00:19:40.510
MATT: You understand me.

00:19:46.088 --> 00:19:52.431
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I'm a new DM, and you've inspired
me. Oh my god, I can't even.

00:19:55.424 --> 00:20:06.314
MATT: I'll answer my question real fast because
it's a fast answer: a lot of cocaine. No. You keep

00:20:06.314 --> 00:20:10.589
the rules there as a basis. It's a lot of paying
attention. It's a balance between having to be

00:20:10.589 --> 00:20:15.424
bogged down in the rules, and having to let the
story unfold and let the players have fun, so you

00:20:15.424 --> 00:20:19.911
keep a balance there. How to keep them together? I
have a lot of years of experience at this, and a

00:20:19.911 --> 00:20:22.692
lot of patience. Thank you.

00:20:24.952 --> 00:20:28.961
TALIESIN: Watching him pack up all the maps we
didn't use in a huff at the end of the night is

00:20:28.961 --> 00:20:30.648
always fun.

00:20:30.648 --> 00:20:33.566
MARISHA: His trunk is like a map graveyard.

00:20:33.566 --> 00:20:35.499
MATT: Yeah, actually.

00:20:36.179 --> 00:20:40.413
LAURA: Do you ever reuse maps that we didn't get
to? And you go, "Oh, I can make this a later thing."

00:20:40.413 --> 00:20:43.841
MATT: I have them just in case, but that doesn't
really happen because you guys don't really

00:20:43.841 --> 00:20:51.622
venture back to the same places, which is great.
It means you're traveling the world. It's wonderful.

00:20:51.622 --> 00:20:54.361
MARISHA: Just like my passive-aggressive aunt.

00:20:54.361 --> 00:20:58.550
LAURA: You want to answer the player question?

00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:04.150
TALIESIN: Yeah. Only the night after. After the
game I go home and I sit in bed and have that-- I

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:09.870
should probably drink a couple of shots of whiskey
so that I fall asleep. Don't think about every

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:13.701
stupid thing I've done over the past four hours
that I've then broadcast to several thousand

00:21:13.701 --> 00:21:18.941
people, and oh god, what have I done? What am I
doing? I really need to sleep. Oh god. I have

00:21:18.941 --> 00:21:24.311
auditions to do. It's two o'clock in the morning.
I really-- Oh god. I have an-- Oh no. Then I fall asleep.

00:21:24.329 --> 00:21:25.907
MARISHA: That's healthy.

00:21:29.937 --> 00:21:32.233
LAURA: I think about it way too much.

00:21:32.233 --> 00:21:34.741
MARISHA: Yeah. I'm with you.

00:21:37.191 --> 00:21:42.611
LAURA: I fell asleep thinking about it. Woke up
thinking about it. Then I'll be driving and

00:21:42.611 --> 00:21:49.872
thinking about it. Eating lunch and thinking about
it. Thinking about, I need to talk to Vax about

00:21:49.872 --> 00:21:52.651
this. What is happening?

00:21:54.211 --> 00:22:00.070
MARISHA: You often think about all the things.
Like Percy. Next time, next game I'm going to give

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:09.768
Percy a piece of my mind. Then you're like, "Hey,
Percy! I have a flower for you." That's about as

00:22:09.768 --> 00:22:11.146
far as that goes.

00:22:11.146 --> 00:22:14.191
LAURA: You go crazy in the night and then there's
a whole week in between, and we forget about it.

00:22:15.931 --> 00:22:18.242
Then we get there, it's like, "I'm not mad at you
anymore."

00:22:18.242 --> 00:22:19.572
TALIESIN: No. It's fine.

00:22:19.572 --> 00:22:21.312
LAURA: It's okay you killed me. No big deal.

00:22:21.312 --> 00:22:27.992
TALIESIN: Yeah. No big deal. Maybe next time it'll
take and we'll see.

00:22:27.992 --> 00:22:33.504
AUDIENCE: (oohing)

00:22:34.444 --> 00:22:40.503
TRAVIS: The fear was real when she almost died. I
think my face was a projection of absolute terror

00:22:40.503 --> 00:22:48.051
because I knew that night was never going to end.
The sun was going to come up and the mascara would

00:22:48.051 --> 00:22:57.046
be down the cheeks and she'd be ripping up art in
her room like, "It's all over. It's all over!" I'd

00:22:57.046 --> 00:23:05.831
have a fire extinguisher pointed at her like,
"Calm down. It's just in your mind." I don't spend

00:23:05.831 --> 00:23:12.661
much time with my character because Grog doesn't
think. It's just impulse.

00:23:12.661 --> 00:23:14.086
LAURA: That's a lie.

00:23:14.086 --> 00:23:18.309
TRAVIS: No. He holds grudges. That's about it.
Then he likes to kill the thing that moves.

00:23:18.309 --> 00:23:19.872
(laughter)

00:23:19.872 --> 00:23:23.473
LAURA: You'll come home from a game and you'll be
like, "I can't believe I didn't rage when I could

00:23:23.473 --> 00:23:30.122
"have raged. I can't believe I didn't take
advantage of that relentless whatever."

00:23:30.122 --> 00:23:35.272
TRAVIS: I forget my stuff. It took me two and a
half, three years to learn everything. I think

00:23:35.272 --> 00:23:41.763
both of those fights with Kern, I was still
forgetting to add strength modifiers. It's stupid,

00:23:41.763 --> 00:23:44.301
but it makes the game good.

00:23:44.301 --> 00:23:48.323
MATT: To be fair, we did play Pathfinder for two
years. About the time you guys got familiar fully

00:23:48.323 --> 00:23:50.602
with your character abilities, oh, new edition!

00:23:50.602 --> 00:23:53.970
TRAVIS: Yeah. That's totally why I suck at the
numbers.

00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:59.374
LAURA: That is why I suck at the spells. Because I
didn't understand that there was even a thing for

00:23:59.374 --> 00:24:01.999
concentration because I didn't have spells in
Pathfinder.

00:24:01.999 --> 00:24:03.751
MARISHA: Yeah, the concentration spells are a
bitch.

00:24:03.751 --> 00:24:04.770
LAURA: They suck!

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:06.881
MATT: It's a balance tool.

00:24:06.881 --> 00:24:08.431
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:08.431 --> 00:24:11.930
MATT: You should be glad I forget the
concentration checks. I'm trying to be better

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:13.183
about that.

00:24:13.183 --> 00:24:14.642
TALIESIN: Don't get better about that.

00:24:17.342 --> 00:24:23.843
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I have two thank yous. One to
Laura, you and Alison Haislip are the reason my

00:24:23.843 --> 00:24:25.311
wife now plays D&amp;D.

00:24:25.311 --> 00:24:27.052
LAURA: Seriously. Titansgrave?

00:24:27.052 --> 00:24:31.902
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Titansgrave panel, yes. We were
at the Titansgrave panel at Comic Con.

00:24:31.946 --> 00:24:33.313
LAURA: Awesome.

00:24:33.313 --> 00:24:34.832
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I'm still waiting for season
two.

00:24:34.832 --> 00:24:36.132
LAURA: It's happening.

00:24:36.132 --> 00:24:38.383
(cheering)

00:24:38.383 --> 00:24:40.651
AUDIENCE: Grog, or Travis.

00:24:40.651 --> 00:24:41.853
TRAVIS: (Grog voice) My man.

00:24:41.853 --> 00:24:45.820
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you. And mostly the rest of
the panel, thank you for supporting the military.

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:47.323
I'm an active duty Marine.

00:24:47.323 --> 00:24:52.253
(cheering)

00:24:54.603 --> 00:25:02.643
AUDIENCE MEMBER: It saved the mentality of some of
my Marines while in the country, so thank you. For

00:25:02.643 --> 00:25:13.392
Matt. I've recently been DMing my wife's campaign.
I'm actually building from scratch a new campaign.

00:25:13.392 --> 00:25:19.991
How far out did you build your story when you
first started? Because I've got the first

00:25:19.991 --> 00:25:26.511
iteration, but from there I'm stuck because I'm
not sure how far out to build it in order to

00:25:26.511 --> 00:25:32.152
accommodate where I might want it to go as far as
where they're going to go.

00:25:32.152 --> 00:25:35.102
MATT: It's very intimidating at first, when you
consider the possibilities of how much you can

00:25:35.102 --> 00:25:42.024
create: what you should, what you shouldn't. It's
very daunting at first. I built just a town. A

00:25:42.024 --> 00:25:45.842
singular town with a little swamp around the
outskirts, and that was where they started, and

00:25:45.842 --> 00:25:50.081
that was where their story began. I let them play
in there for a session and then by the end of that

00:25:50.081 --> 00:25:54.602
session, I had an idea of what they were looking
for, what they enjoyed out of the game, and I can

00:25:54.602 --> 00:26:01.151
build the next town, and the spaces in between.
For me, it was letting them drive the story for

00:26:01.151 --> 00:26:06.127
the first few sessions and expanding based on
where they seemingly wanted to go, what they

00:26:06.152 --> 00:26:09.960
wanted to accomplish in the game. Don't feel like
you have to front-load everything. I will say, if

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:14.721
you want to make a strong, fun campaign, any
general themes of the world you want to do, set

00:26:14.721 --> 00:26:19.473
that at the beginning. Like the Eberron setting
for D&amp;D. It's a very high magic campaign that

00:26:19.473 --> 00:26:24.401
transpired after a great war that destroyed a
bunch of these main, top cities, and everyone's

00:26:24.401 --> 00:26:29.482
just now recovering from that encounter. That's a
cool thing to build around from there. Think of a

00:26:29.482 --> 00:26:33.380
really strong theme that the rest of your world
could be based around, but you don't have to build

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:38.661
the entire countryside before you start playing.
Start very small. Where you can control and flesh

00:26:38.661 --> 00:26:42.990
out a small area, see how the players wander in
that space, and when they start feeling like

00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:46.614
they've accomplished everything they can
accomplish in that area, build the next one and

00:26:46.614 --> 00:26:48.361
take it from there.

00:26:48.361 --> 00:26:49.381
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Awesome. Thank you.

00:26:49.381 --> 00:26:51.911
MATT: You'll be making up half of it anyway, as
you go, every time they do something you don't

00:26:51.911 --> 00:26:54.961
expect. Good question.

00:26:58.861 --> 00:27:01.001
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi. Love you guys.

00:27:01.001 --> 00:27:03.351
MATT: Is that the Drumpf hat by the way?

00:27:03.351 --> 00:27:04.201
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah.

00:27:04.201 --> 00:27:08.593
MATT: Hell yeah, it is. The Donald Drumpf hat.

00:27:08.593 --> 00:27:11.272
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I feel like you guys could do a
thing for-- what is the name of the world?

00:27:11.272 --> 00:27:13.261
MATT: Exandria.

00:27:13.261 --> 00:27:15.361
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You could Make Exandria Great
Again.

00:27:18.861 --> 00:27:20.711
MATT: Just a dragon with X eyes on it.

00:27:20.711 --> 00:27:23.452
TALIESIN: That got wheels turning.

00:27:25.362 --> 00:27:32.411
AUDIENCE MEMBER: My question is, as voice actors,
is there a popular series, a cartoon, that you're

00:27:32.411 --> 00:27:36.692
not in but you want to be in, and why is it Rick
and Morty?

00:27:36.692 --> 00:27:40.863
(laughter)

00:27:40.863 --> 00:27:42.152
LAURA and TALIESIN: It is Rick and Morty.

00:27:42.152 --> 00:27:44.152
MARISHA: It's absolutely Rick and Morty

00:27:44.152 --> 00:27:47.596
TALIESIN: I auditioned for Rick and Morty for a
couple of things, and I was like, "This is awesome

00:27:47.596 --> 00:27:54.693
"and I'm not going to book it, but god, I want to
read it over and over." It was a Hitler Lincoln.

00:27:54.693 --> 00:27:59.503
Season one. Oh my god, yeah.

00:27:59.503 --> 00:28:06.482
MARISHA: I also love Dan Harmon so much. I'm a
massive Community fan. I'll watch anything Dan

00:28:06.482 --> 00:28:09.202
Harmon does. He's amazing.

00:28:09.202 --> 00:28:18.571
MATT: That show is phenomenal. I'm trying to prod
Justin Roiland to make me come on and do an

00:28:18.571 --> 00:28:25.031
appearance some time. We'll see. We'll see if he
ever has time. He's a busy man. Any other shows

00:28:25.031 --> 00:28:26.772
you guys want to do?

00:28:29.042 --> 00:28:29.972
TRAVIS: Sailor Moon.

00:28:29.972 --> 00:28:33.447
(cheering)

00:28:33.447 --> 00:28:35.369
MATT: You'd make a good Jupiter.

00:28:37.859 --> 00:28:41.281
TALIESIN and LAURA: Adventure Time.

00:28:42.136 --> 00:28:45.641
TALIESIN: I'm actually doing one of the shows. I
can't talk about it though, one of the shows I'm

00:28:45.641 --> 00:28:49.031
on. I hit one of my little goals.

00:28:51.861 --> 00:28:55.510
MATT: Rick and Morty. Good job. Good question.

00:28:57.850 --> 00:29:01.710
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Two thank yous. Thank you for
actually teaching me the game through your show,

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:07.082
because I have a d20 from Loot Crate that I never
knew how to use, so now I have it.

00:29:09.642 --> 00:29:10.801
MARISHA: This has context now.

00:29:10.801 --> 00:29:13.071
TRAVIS: What is this thing?

00:29:15.131 --> 00:29:19.002
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you for basically giving me
a show that I binge watched for three weeks

00:29:19.002 --> 00:29:26.642
straight. Thank you so much for that. Those
four-hour shows make the day pass really fast, but

00:29:26.642 --> 00:29:31.844
I know that you guys have guest stars, and I think
you guys had Chris Hardwick recently.

00:29:31.844 --> 00:29:33.842
LAURA and MARISHA: Last night.

00:29:33.842 --> 00:29:38.062
AUDIENCE MEMBER: If there was ever a possibility,
would you ever have someone that was completely

00:29:38.062 --> 00:29:43.781
new to D&amp;D and have them join you guys for maybe a
mission or two?

00:29:45.131 --> 00:29:48.822
MARISHA: Yeah, we have. Mary and Will were both
newbies.

00:29:48.822 --> 00:29:51.731
LAURA: She freaking took to it like it was
nothing.

00:29:53.111 --> 00:29:59.275
MATT: You did your first session. It's true. It's
funny, you'll see a lot of people who don't

00:29:59.275 --> 00:30:03.780
understand D&amp;D, but performer or not, I've had
people that I've played games with years ago, in

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:07.631
high school, it was their first time playing, and
once it clicked how it works in their head, it was

00:30:07.631 --> 00:30:12.410
like they had been playing their whole life.
That's not the case with everybody, some people it

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:15.491
takes a little bit longer to get into it, but
there's some folks that all of a sudden it's like,

00:30:15.491 --> 00:30:16.932
"Oh! Oh."

00:30:16.932 --> 00:30:18.702
(laughter)

00:30:18.702 --> 00:30:19.601
TRAVIS: Hook us in.

00:30:19.601 --> 00:30:23.442
MATT: Yeah! We've had a lot of people who it was
their first time, and we also did a couple one

00:30:23.442 --> 00:30:27.541
shots for folks who had little to no experience
from any RPGs previously, so we've done a few.

00:30:27.541 --> 00:30:32.311
There has been some discussions about maybe doing
a community contest to have a fan at some point in

00:30:32.311 --> 00:30:35.119
the near future. We're trying to work out the
logistics of that, we'll see if that can happen.

00:30:35.119 --> 00:30:36.192
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I nominate Kimmy!

00:30:37.262 --> 00:30:39.681
MATT: What's up, Kimmy?

00:30:39.681 --> 00:30:41.853
TALIESIN: We have a lot of things we want to do.

00:30:41.853 --> 00:30:46.788
MATT: Yeah, we're trying out something there. Once
again, I don't want it to be too much of a

00:30:46.788 --> 00:30:50.683
guest-centric show, because it is the story of Vox
Machina, but we will still have guests coming in

00:30:50.683 --> 00:30:56.903
every two months or so depending on availability
and if it fits in the story, and I'm sure we'll be

00:30:56.903 --> 00:30:59.122
dragging some more newbies into the fold as we
do.

00:30:59.122 --> 00:31:00.071
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you guys!

00:31:00.071 --> 00:31:01.602
ALL: Thank you!

00:31:04.352 --> 00:31:05.354
MARISHA: Sun bros!

00:31:07.384 --> 00:31:10.923
AUDIENCE MEMBER: First off, thank you, because you
guys are the only reason that I even thought I

00:31:10.923 --> 00:31:20.251
could DM. As a new DM, there's one dude in my
party, he's a little homicidal, and I was

00:31:20.251 --> 00:31:29.850
wondering if there are-- I see you. I was
wondering if there are any creative ways that you

00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:35.202
would recommend me to maybe curb him from killing
all my NPCs. He got five kills.

00:31:39.462 --> 00:31:44.462
MATT: Let's say, theoretically, a person not in
the game killed somebody. They'd be in a lot of

00:31:44.462 --> 00:31:52.491
trouble. That can also happen in your game. Unless
they're very good at hiding the body, which they

00:31:52.491 --> 00:31:56.004
can get away with maybe once. If they don't learn
their lesson, and they've gotten to what you say

00:31:56.004 --> 00:31:58.766
is homicidal, which to me leads me to believe it's
happened quite a few times?

00:31:59.666 --> 00:32:00.622
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Every new person.

00:32:00.622 --> 00:32:01.910
MATT: Every new person?

00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:08.752
(laughter)

00:32:08.752 --> 00:32:15.363
TRAVIS: Where's your game? I call next!

00:32:16.533 --> 00:32:17.231
AUDIENCE MEMBER: The worst!

00:32:18.641 --> 00:32:24.131
MATT: I would say consider one, in the society
they're playing in, there is probably some sort of

00:32:24.131 --> 00:32:30.632
peacekeeping or law-keeping group, whether it be
guards, or even bounty hunters that can be sent

00:32:30.632 --> 00:32:35.602
out to hunt down the person, because it's not a
CSI episode, there are people with magical

00:32:35.602 --> 00:32:39.892
capabilities. They can scry and find out directly
who is responsible, if the person who killed them

00:32:39.892 --> 00:32:45.062
isn't very careful or has some way of magically
warding that information. Suddenly that player has

00:32:45.062 --> 00:32:51.808
much more powerful NPCs hunting them down, trying
to arrest or kill that player character, which

00:32:51.808 --> 00:32:56.132
leads to a really, really cool story arc in its
own right. If they end up not being careful going

00:32:56.132 --> 00:33:01.111
forward or learning their lesson, they might wind
up being arrested and/or killed by the bounty

00:33:01.111 --> 00:33:06.142
hunter, which is a great lesson to the rest of the
players. Or they could repent at the last minute

00:33:06.142 --> 00:33:14.175
and then have to do community service, because
here's the thing. All those hardcore hackers, that

00:33:14.175 --> 00:33:14.732
have done--

00:33:14.732 --> 00:33:18.497
(laughter)

00:33:18.497 --> 00:33:19.729
TRAVIS: Blaze of glory!

00:33:20.489 --> 00:33:24.791
MATT: There's that too. But there are the people
who are big hackers, that hack into the government

00:33:24.791 --> 00:33:29.668
and as such, as opposed to being put in prison for
years, they were offered a position. Maybe if they

00:33:29.668 --> 00:33:33.760
can be arrested, and then have the head of the
town be like, "I'll absolve you of these murders--

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:38.632
that you will never do again or I will kill you--
if you go ahead and do this task for me, since you

00:33:38.632 --> 00:33:40.483
seem so skilled at killing individuals."

00:33:40.483 --> 00:33:47.644
TALIESIN: Yeah, and then you can hand them an
alignment-based weapon that they can wield. A

00:33:47.644 --> 00:33:51.220
weapon that can be wielded, but if you shift
alignment suddenly that weapon turns on you.

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:55.292
MATT: There's a bunch of different ways you can do
that. These are some ideas to let you play with

00:33:55.292 --> 00:33:55.912
for a while.

00:33:55.912 --> 00:33:56.614
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you!

00:33:56.614 --> 00:33:58.342
MATT: You're welcome! Thank you.

00:34:01.392 --> 00:34:06.804
LAURA: By the way, that's how he plays video
games. He walks around and tells me to kill

00:34:06.804 --> 00:34:12.965
anybody I see, anything I talk to. He watches and
he goes, "Kill that person! Kill that chicken!"

00:34:16.395 --> 00:34:29.482
TRAVIS: Everything dies. Hey, if the chicken
deserves to live, it'll get away. I'm just saying!

00:34:29.482 --> 00:34:31.733
She won't kill a chicken, but you'll steal a
broom.

00:34:31.733 --> 00:34:35.982
AUDIENCE: (oohing)

00:34:35.982 --> 00:34:37.482
(laughter)

00:34:37.482 --> 00:34:40.260
TALIESIN: I so support you and if I had been on
your side of the table I would have been like, "Go

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:46.295
for the candles! He's got insane stuff on this
sheet. Let's just take it!"

00:34:46.295 --> 00:34:49.242
TRAVIS: We could have tossed him in the lava and
had everything!

00:34:49.242 --> 00:34:52.102
TALIESIN: We should have jumped him, taken
everything, and thrown him in the lava, and been

00:34:52.102 --> 00:34:53.683
like, "I don't know what happened to that
dragon."

00:34:53.683 --> 00:34:55.473
LAURA: That's the thing; he handed it to me. I
mean, come on!

00:34:56.173 --> 00:34:58.332
TRAVIS: You rolled with disadvantage for it.

00:34:58.332 --> 00:34:59.153
LAURA: I did.

00:34:59.153 --> 00:35:01.632
TALIESIN: You are so my hero. You don't know.
You're my hero.

00:35:01.632 --> 00:35:04.903
MARISHA: We're really good people. We're role
models.

00:35:08.743 --> 00:35:16.488
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Laura. Shame on you. I cannot
wait to see that come into play. Praise the sun,

00:35:16.488 --> 00:35:24.488
we're almost there. First off, I wanted to thank
you all, just for being you. You guys are awesome,

00:35:24.488 --> 00:35:34.018
so entertaining. You do such great work for the
community. I've been DMing for 12 or so years now,

00:35:34.018 --> 00:35:42.389
and just in the past year I've been watching you
guys, I've learned so much. Being voice actors,

00:35:42.389 --> 00:35:51.070
you all have an advantage. You get really into
your characters, which is something not everyone

00:35:51.070 --> 00:36:00.208
can do. Is there ever a time that you guys-- and I
really wish Liam was here for this-- maybe find

00:36:00.208 --> 00:36:03.985
yourselves getting too sucked into your
characters?

00:36:03.985 --> 00:36:07.535
(laughter)

00:36:07.535 --> 00:36:09.668
TRAVIS: Say that one more time?

00:36:09.668 --> 00:36:13.721
(laughter)

00:36:13.721 --> 00:36:14.920
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I love you.

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:20.780
(laughter)

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:23.059
MATT: I can't tell if she's thinking or if she's
coming over to beat you up.

00:36:23.059 --> 00:36:24.719
(laughter)

00:36:24.719 --> 00:36:29.324
TRAVIS: She like, earth elemental into the floor.
She's coming up under your nuts.

00:36:31.754 --> 00:36:32.698
MARISHA: Natural 20.

00:36:37.748 --> 00:36:39.960
MARISHA: Is everyone waiting for me to answer this
question?

00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:42.378
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Anyone, really.

00:36:49.688 --> 00:36:57.368
LAURA: No? I feel like there's a pretty good
separation of what I feel like, so even in the

00:36:57.368 --> 00:37:04.730
scene-- Okay, when it's really sad, if Trinket's
about to die, I'm really sad, but I also am aware

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:11.670
that there's fun stuff going on outside of that,
so I can be crying as Vex and then he'll say

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:13.489
something stupid and I'll start laughing as me.

00:37:16.979 --> 00:37:22.650
TALIESIN: We have those heavy moments, and then we
hit our-- and I use this term loosely-- ten minute

00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:31.480
break. We know it's not ten minutes, but the
minute that we actually get a breather, no matter

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:37.959
what was going on it goes into, "(hysterical
laughing) Oh, that was so awesome! Oh my god!"

00:37:39.709 --> 00:37:47.450
MARISHA: Yeah, we're all aware. We're not crazy
<i>yet.</i> Like Laura was saying, we've been with

00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:56.980
these characters now for three years. Keyleth is
my imaginary best friend, in a weird way. I am

00:37:56.980 --> 00:38:01.159
definitely emotionally invested and when we're in,
like Laura was saying earlier, when we're in these

00:38:01.159 --> 00:38:08.241
characters' minds a lot, it's easy to get
emotionally invested as actors, but we're not

00:38:08.241 --> 00:38:11.830
totally insane yet.

00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:17.480
LAURA: You seem freaking crazy right now, as you
were saying it.

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:19.732
MARISHA: This is my velociraptor stance.

00:38:19.732 --> 00:38:27.935
(laughter)

00:38:27.935 --> 00:38:34.660
AUDIENCE MEMBER: A few times I think I see,
especially Liam, sitting there, with his brooding

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:38.741
face, hanging back, I want to--

00:38:38.741 --> 00:38:40.848
TALIESIN: That's his face, man, that's not nice.

00:38:41.588 --> 00:38:50.799
LAURA: I mean, Liam in general is broody, and he
always has been, but at the same time, he stays in

00:38:50.799 --> 00:38:59.077
character I think more than the rest of us through
a lot of the game, so he'll be-- What are you

00:38:59.077 --> 00:39:00.108
freaking doing?!

00:39:00.108 --> 00:39:03.208
(laughter)

00:39:03.208 --> 00:39:14.167
LAURA: It's distracting! He'll be listening to a
conversation that other people are having as Vax,

00:39:14.167 --> 00:39:19.145
instead of necessarily as Liam some of the time. I
have leaned over to him, and whispered to him

00:39:19.145 --> 00:39:28.167
"What is freaking wrong with you?" He leaned over
and went, "I'm not sad! Vax is sad right now!" and

00:39:28.167 --> 00:39:31.892
then he'll start laughing. He stays in it a bit
more than we do.

00:39:31.892 --> 00:39:39.290
MARISHA: Yeah, I think every time I cry, I get
inundated with people being like, "Oh my god,

00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:45.965
Marisha. I couldn't tell if you were crying, or if
Keyleth was crying." I'm like--

00:39:45.965 --> 00:39:47.578
LAURA: "Me neither."

00:39:49.218 --> 00:39:52.878
MARISHA: Yes? Little bit of column A, little bit
of column B?

00:39:52.878 --> 00:39:55.909
TALIESIN: I lean over very quietly. "Stop it,
you're wasting water!"

00:39:55.909 --> 00:39:58.711
MARISHA: We're in a drought. Damn it.

00:39:58.711 --> 00:40:02.651
(laughter)

00:40:02.651 --> 00:40:06.348
MATT: Thank you for the question! Praise the sun.

00:40:07.478 --> 00:40:12.289
LAURA: But the emotions that we're feeling during
the game, those are real honest emotions, because

00:40:12.289 --> 00:40:13.747
we're so connected to--

00:40:14.487 --> 00:40:22.578
MARISHA: Yeah, but for example, when Taliesin, or
sorry, when Percy and Grog get into a conflict--

00:40:22.578 --> 00:40:23.809
TRAVIS: That was so great!

00:40:23.809 --> 00:40:29.400
MARISHA: It was great! They were actually angry at
each other in real life.

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:35.659
TALIESIN: The minute that episode ended, we were
like, "Ugh! We got to go. I want to fight so bad!"

00:40:36.319 --> 00:40:43.290
TRAVIS: Yeah, Grog probably loves Vox Machina
because they always run into people to fight. He

00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:47.996
loves Pike, but that's where all of the action is,
with you guys. If it gets boring, he'd be like,

00:40:47.996 --> 00:40:54.307
"Fuck it, I'm out." Yeah, I love it. I feel like
until he gets hit by each individual character, he

00:40:54.307 --> 00:40:55.550
will not be happy.

00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:58.370
TALIESIN: Yes, I can't wait. I can't wait.

00:40:58.370 --> 00:41:00.979
MARISHA: I didn't know that, challenge accepted.

00:41:04.049 --> 00:41:06.641
MATT: Yes. You, sir!

00:41:06.641 --> 00:41:07.201
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi!

00:41:07.201 --> 00:41:08.158
MATT: Hello.

00:41:08.858 --> 00:41:15.277
AUDIENCE MEMBER: First off, thank you for Critical
Role, and you especially, Matt for all the GM

00:41:15.277 --> 00:41:24.439
tips. You guys have really inspired me to try to
be a better DM for my friends at home. I haven't

00:41:24.439 --> 00:41:29.593
gotten to an actual adventure yet. We've been
doing a bunch of the book campaigns, starters--

00:41:29.593 --> 00:41:30.406
MATT: Those are great.

00:41:34.336 --> 00:41:40.149
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I know a lot of your game is
homebrew, like house rules and everything, but

00:41:40.149 --> 00:41:44.730
something has been bugging me with the
Earthbreaker Groon fight--

00:41:44.730 --> 00:41:47.542
(laughter)

00:41:47.542 --> 00:41:54.185
AUDIENCE MEMBER: It involves Vax, and I wish Liam
was here to talk about it. Because, I play a monk--

00:41:54.185 --> 00:41:57.454
MATT: I already know the question you're going to
ask, and I've answered it 7,000 times on Twitter.

00:41:57.454 --> 00:42:03.515
The reason for the change I made to that, what
you're referring to, which is the Quivering Palm technique--

00:42:03.515 --> 00:42:05.517
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah, because Vax should be dead.

00:42:05.517 --> 00:42:08.635
TRAVIS: 7,000 times already.

00:42:11.845 --> 00:42:16.788
MATT: For that particular ability, Groon was
teaching a lesson, and testing them, as opposed to

00:42:16.797 --> 00:42:21.921
trying to outright destroy them. It was more about
the fear of not knowing what was going to happen,

00:42:21.921 --> 00:42:27.706
so I scaled back the ability, because it versus a
player-- That technique is designed, in theory, to

00:42:27.706 --> 00:42:33.787
be more player used against creatures. For an NPC
to use it against a player, it's pretty harsh. The

00:42:33.787 --> 00:42:38.126
intent is to have someone's heart explode, that's
the idea behind the technique. For the purpose of

00:42:38.126 --> 00:42:42.056
that particular fight with Earthbreaker Groon,
that would have been a little harsh, I think.

00:42:42.056 --> 00:42:47.645
Especially when his focus of his aggression and
testing was against Grog. It could go either way,

00:42:47.645 --> 00:42:51.755
but that was my decision for that fight, but don't
worry, there are plenty of other, not so--

00:42:52.475 --> 00:42:57.837
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Seeing as it's been asked so many
times, I had it in the back of my mind like,

00:42:57.837 --> 00:42:59.936
"Yeah, ask Matt."

00:42:59.936 --> 00:43:02.426
MATT: Oh, it's all good. I'm glad I could clarify
for you.

00:43:02.426 --> 00:43:11.176
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I wanted to ask one more
question. In the future will we be seeing more of

00:43:11.176 --> 00:43:17.816
Vax and Vex's-- a resolution to their issues with
their dad?

00:43:18.996 --> 00:43:26.618
MATT: We shall see. Syngorn currently is not on
this plane of existence. We'll see. Hey, it's all

00:43:26.618 --> 00:43:28.036
been considered and--

00:43:28.036 --> 00:43:29.656
LAURA: You don't want to meet him, he's a dick!

00:43:29.656 --> 00:43:34.607
(laugher)

00:43:34.607 --> 00:43:37.096
TALIESIN: He's actually the character I'm going to
roll when Percy dies.

00:43:37.096 --> 00:43:42.587
(laughter and booing)

00:43:42.587 --> 00:43:45.747
TALIESIN: Kidding! Kidding, Oh my god, you people.

00:43:45.747 --> 00:43:47.454
MARISHA: That's messed up on multiple levels.

00:43:49.554 --> 00:44:00.686
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Vax and Vex trying to be, in
their eyes, a better family member to their half

00:44:00.686 --> 00:44:03.106
sibling that they barely know.

00:44:04.306 --> 00:44:09.337
MATT: They've only met her once, and they did
actually, it was one of those "Hi, Dad. Oh, is

00:44:09.337 --> 00:44:11.615
this who you think is our new mother?"

00:44:11.615 --> 00:44:17.576
LAURA: "Is this your new family? Is this your new
fricking daughter?" Then she was adorable and I

00:44:17.576 --> 00:44:27.646
felt guilty. It's not her fault, I know. She pet
Trinket, she loved him, I gave her a necklace, okay?

00:44:28.806 --> 00:44:31.267
MATT: It's true. I wouldn't be surprised if it
came up.

00:44:31.797 --> 00:44:33.775
TRAVIS: I appreciate your bloodlust.

00:44:35.785 --> 00:44:39.976
MATT: Don't worry, for all you monk users out
there, there are plenty of other individuals that

00:44:39.976 --> 00:44:45.674
are trained in the martial arts in the universe
that are a little less inclined to hold back.

00:44:45.674 --> 00:44:48.108
TALIESIN: I'm excited to try and shoot one.

00:44:48.108 --> 00:44:51.046
MATT: I'm really excited for you to try and shoot
one.

00:44:51.046 --> 00:44:52.546
TALIESIN: That excites me.

00:44:52.546 --> 00:44:56.105
MARISHA: We need a ticker of how many things you
say that are royally messed up.

00:44:56.105 --> 00:45:01.656
TALIESIN: I thought we had a ticker for all the
terrible things I say. Wasn't aware we had stopped that.

00:45:04.776 --> 00:45:09.886
AUDIENCE MEMBER: First I'm going to try to-- oh,
he's already recognized me. Holy shit. Yeah. I was

00:45:09.886 --> 00:45:15.666
going to say, we haven't talked in five or six
years so I wouldn't be surprised if you didn't

00:45:15.666 --> 00:45:18.361
recognize me, but then Diana told me that you
never forget anyone.

00:45:18.361 --> 00:45:22.956
MATT: Not in the face, no. I'm amazed I remember
your name. I don't remember my own name half of

00:45:22.956 --> 00:45:24.748
the time. I went to high school with this guy, by
the way!

00:45:24.748 --> 00:45:27.626
(applause)

00:45:27.626 --> 00:45:28.868
MATT: Good to see you, man!

00:45:28.868 --> 00:45:32.946
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You too! I think the last time we
saw each other was at this convention center five

00:45:32.946 --> 00:45:45.035
or six years ago. So anywho, I was going to first
try to embarrass you by saying thanks for being

00:45:45.035 --> 00:45:49.445
one of the people running Popular Arts Club in
high school when I was a freshman, because I do

00:45:49.445 --> 00:45:56.248
not think I would have grown to be this geek, and
into anime, video games, and D&amp;D if not for you.

00:45:56.248 --> 00:45:59.156
(applause)

00:45:59.156 --> 00:46:02.695
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I hope I did half a good a job as
you helping run it in later years.

00:46:02.695 --> 00:46:09.495
MATT: Thank you. By the way, Popular Arts Club was
our wonderful, our PC club title for anime and

00:46:09.495 --> 00:46:14.916
video games club. Popular Arts Club, where all the
kids go and enjoy the arts that are popular in the

00:46:14.916 --> 00:46:16.836
modern day. Come play Street Fighter.

00:46:18.086 --> 00:46:23.475
AUDIENCE MEMBER: The awkward times when we'd try
to do stuff after school and then people were

00:46:23.475 --> 00:46:25.628
like, "Oh, you don't want to call it PACAS."

00:46:25.628 --> 00:46:27.815
(laughter)

00:46:27.815 --> 00:46:33.627
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Right, sorry. My question was,
now that you're playing much more regularly, do

00:46:33.627 --> 00:46:37.966
you worry about power level creep? Meaning the
fact that everyone's going to be gaining

00:46:37.966 --> 00:46:42.626
experience that much faster and levelling up that
much faster, and you might reach a point where the

00:46:42.626 --> 00:46:46.758
power levels are getting ridiculous, or do you
curb that?

00:46:47.568 --> 00:46:52.606
MATT: It's always something to keep in mind for
it. The only person that's solely responsible for

00:46:52.606 --> 00:46:57.016
that would be myself giving out too many items or
too much experience points, and I have a system

00:46:57.016 --> 00:47:00.516
based on the encounters and the size of the party.
It works out pretty well. They've been evenly

00:47:00.516 --> 00:47:05.855
levelling up, but that means I have got to make
the challenges harder and the creatures more

00:47:05.855 --> 00:47:12.088
deadly. I tend to alter a lot of the creatures in
the Monster Manual, and customize them for my own

00:47:12.088 --> 00:47:16.027
uses. That involves giving them not just a little
more hit points, because you don't want to make

00:47:16.027 --> 00:47:20.777
creatures harder by making them longer to fight;
that's not as much fun. That involves increasing

00:47:20.777 --> 00:47:24.412
the damage a lot of their techniques do, that
involves giving them new abilities that aren't in

00:47:24.412 --> 00:47:29.028
the Monster Manual that can hit multiple guys at
once, or cause more conditional effects on them

00:47:29.028 --> 00:47:34.366
that will mess up the battle and make it more
interesting, or setting up battlefield scenarios

00:47:34.366 --> 00:47:39.906
that introduce more dangers outside of the
creatures and up the ante. It's always a balance

00:47:39.906 --> 00:47:44.216
as you learn, and this is my first campaign with
5th Edition systems, so even I've had my growing

00:47:44.216 --> 00:47:48.165
pains with it going forward, but I'm pretty
comfortable that if I start feeling that becomes a

00:47:48.165 --> 00:47:50.818
serious issue, I'll have ways to counteract this.

00:47:51.328 --> 00:47:54.325
MARISHA: She just died three games ago, man!

00:47:55.285 --> 00:47:56.452
MATT: That wasn't even part of the battle.

00:47:56.452 --> 00:47:58.095
MARISHA: That's true.

00:47:58.095 --> 00:47:59.758
MATT: Good to see you!

00:47:59.758 --> 00:48:00.568
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You too.

00:48:02.318 --> 00:48:03.806
MATT: That was a nice little meeting.

00:48:06.556 --> 00:48:11.703
AUDIENCE MEMBER: First off, to the panel, I know
you guys have had interesting experiences with

00:48:11.703 --> 00:48:17.307
Critters who have submitted like, "Hey, they
should fight this next!" I have a particularly

00:48:17.307 --> 00:48:24.106
sadistic moon druid in my party that I want to
punish in a similar way, but I want for his

00:48:24.106 --> 00:48:27.696
comeuppance-- coming back to the fans, what would
you like me to punish him with?

00:48:27.696 --> 00:48:33.133
(oohing)

00:48:33.133 --> 00:48:34.426
MATT: What level is the druid?

00:48:34.426 --> 00:48:38.565
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Everyone's level seven. He has a
penchant for summoning eight giant badgers at once

00:48:38.565 --> 00:48:40.827
to fight any creature I throw at them.

00:48:40.827 --> 00:48:43.647
MATT: How do we want to punish this druid?

00:48:45.607 --> 00:48:48.158
AUDIENCE MEMBER: He's an ass. He makes Grog look
like a saint.

00:48:51.378 --> 00:48:53.236
AUDIENCE MEMBER: He skinned an orc.

00:48:53.236 --> 00:48:55.576
MATT: That's pretty cool.

00:49:01.396 --> 00:49:05.887
MARISHA: You realize you're giving him
trans-dimensional power, right? Do you realize the

00:49:05.887 --> 00:49:08.909
Pandora's box you could be opening right now?

00:49:08.909 --> 00:49:13.520
MATT: Here's a fun little tool. There are a number
of creatures in the Monster Manual, or creatures

00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:17.996
you can create, that don't really have damage
values to their attacks. Some of them just bring

00:49:17.996 --> 00:49:26.515
players to zero, like banshees, or other such
creatures that have capabilities that no matter

00:49:26.515 --> 00:49:31.616
how powerful you are, no matter how many allies
they have, they make the incorrect saving throw,

00:49:31.616 --> 00:49:38.797
(thump). There's also abyssal- and devil-based
creatures that don't kill, but they capture and

00:49:38.797 --> 00:49:48.234
enslave. So there's always that possible part of
the campaign where the player now has to spend

00:49:48.234 --> 00:49:51.257
some time in servitude in one of the many layers
of the Nine Hells.

00:49:51.257 --> 00:49:52.297
MARISHA: The Deliverance arc.

00:49:52.297 --> 00:49:54.598
(laughter)

00:49:54.598 --> 00:49:57.506
TRAVIS: Have Earthbreaker Groon and Clarota ride a
beholder in.

00:49:57.506 --> 00:50:07.757
MATT: There is that. You know what? Yeah. Go ahead
and see if there's any denizens of the abyss that

00:50:07.757 --> 00:50:09.077
look interesting to use.

00:50:12.077 --> 00:50:16.555
AUDIENCE MEMBER: A chasme showed up, that could
always happen again. As someone who's aspiring to

00:50:16.555 --> 00:50:21.393
be a voice actor, if you guys have time after the
panel I would love to pick at least one of your

00:50:21.393 --> 00:50:24.207
brains. I'm done.

00:50:25.837 --> 00:50:30.776
MARISHA: What would be more productive for you is
to go to iwanttobeavoiceactor.com. I'm serious.

00:50:30.776 --> 00:50:31.936
AUDIENCE MEMBER: That's a thing?

00:50:31.936 --> 00:50:38.968
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm serious. That's Dee Bradley
Baker's website. He's probably one of the most

00:50:38.968 --> 00:50:46.399
prolific voice actors in this industry. He's
amazing, he's in everything that you've ever seen, ever.

00:50:48.676 --> 00:50:52.337
MATT: Pretty much any advice we would give is
already on that site. It's heavily, heavily

00:50:52.337 --> 00:50:54.632
detailed. Go to iwanttobeavoiceactor.com.

00:50:54.632 --> 00:50:58.475
LAURA: He gets a bunch of other voice actors and
asks them questions, and puts them on the website

00:50:58.475 --> 00:51:05.396
as well. Another good resource is Voice-Over Voice
Actor: What It's Like Behind the Mic, and that's

00:51:05.396 --> 00:51:09.107
by Yuri Lowenthal and Tara Platt who are also
working all the time.

00:51:09.107 --> 00:51:12.838
MARISHA: You saw Yuri Lowenthal on Titansgrave, so
you know him as well.

00:51:12.838 --> 00:51:17.232
TALIESIN: That's a book I recommend to anybody.
It's really amazing.

00:51:17.232 --> 00:51:19.709
MARISHA: That's your source list.

00:51:19.709 --> 00:51:23.715
TRAVIS: We have five minutes left, so be
expedient.

00:51:24.155 --> 00:51:31.966
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi! Totally serious, random
question: If you were a fruit, what fruit would

00:51:31.966 --> 00:51:32.906
you be, and why?

00:51:32.906 --> 00:51:36.075
LAURA and MARISHA: Our characters?

00:51:36.075 --> 00:51:38.227
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Not your characters, you
personally.

00:51:38.227 --> 00:51:39.507
TRAVIS: Pineapple!

00:51:41.677 --> 00:51:43.580
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Any fruit, it could be a tomato.

00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:44.912
TRAVIS: Why? Because it tastes good.

00:51:44.912 --> 00:51:46.847
TALIESIN: I've got mine, I'm down.

00:51:46.847 --> 00:51:48.236
LAURA: I would be a mango.

00:51:49.466 --> 00:51:52.395
MARISHA: I would be an apple. Ruby red.

00:51:55.425 --> 00:51:59.355
TALIESIN: I would be a lime, because then I would
make a fabulous pie and would be really good in

00:51:59.355 --> 00:52:00.288
alcoholic beverages.

00:52:00.288 --> 00:52:05.476
(cheering)

00:52:05.476 --> 00:52:08.636
MATT: I would be a grapefruit because it looks
delicious, then it's surprisingly sour and not

00:52:08.636 --> 00:52:10.697
enjoyable unless you're over the age of 70.

00:52:15.927 --> 00:52:17.406
LAURA: I love grapefruit, Matt.

00:52:17.406 --> 00:52:18.760
MATT: Or you're Laura.

00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:22.289
MARISHA: Over there!

00:52:22.289 --> 00:52:24.042
AUDIENCE MEMBER: That was actually my question.

00:52:24.042 --> 00:52:25.707
MATT: Damn it!

00:52:27.997 --> 00:52:31.178
AUDIENCE MEMBER: This is for Matt and also the
players. Matt, you like throwing in little

00:52:31.178 --> 00:52:37.115
references sometimes, like Thordak being Thursday,
and Sam's character being based off of Eminem. Are

00:52:37.115 --> 00:52:40.707
there any references that have been hidden in the
campaign or hidden in your character's'

00:52:40.707 --> 00:52:46.174
backstories that maybe haven't been discovered
yet? Or something you put in thinking that, "Oh,

00:52:46.174 --> 00:52:48.695
they're going to notice that!" that they've never
noticed at all?

00:52:48.695 --> 00:52:57.845
MATT: I don't know, maybe. Now you know how that
feels. I love it. All of them, Travis more than

00:52:57.845 --> 00:53:02.748
anybody, would come to me and be like, "What did
that mean when that happened in the game?" I'd be

00:53:02.748 --> 00:53:03.627
like, "I don't know."

00:53:03.627 --> 00:53:07.267
AUDIENCE MEMBER: More like outside references
where you took something from outside and snuck it

00:53:07.267 --> 00:53:08.356
in to the game.

00:53:08.356 --> 00:53:12.704
MATT: Right. Most of them the internet has picked
up. You guys are a pretty sharp crowd, so

00:53:12.704 --> 00:53:14.586
everything is pretty much squeezed through.

00:53:14.586 --> 00:53:18.777
TALIESIN: All of the people on my list are based
off of real people that I know, and I don't think

00:53:18.777 --> 00:53:19.997
any of them know that.

00:53:19.997 --> 00:53:22.557
(laughter)

00:53:22.557 --> 00:53:30.099
TALIESIN: Even their names, like Anders,
Cassandra, that whole arc is all-- All of the

00:53:30.099 --> 00:53:34.377
names of my siblings are references. Vesper
doesn't know.

00:53:34.377 --> 00:53:37.216
TRAVIS: Did everyone know that Thordak meant
Thursday except me?

00:53:38.726 --> 00:53:43.216
TALIESIN: Did anybody not know? Oh god, it's like
crickets out there.

00:53:45.686 --> 00:53:49.100
LAURA: You learned something! What a great panel!

00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:52.713
TALIESIN: We've all learned a little something
today.

00:53:52.713 --> 00:53:57.599
MATT: I was surprised people picked up on that. I
was looking for cool dragons that had a good sound

00:53:57.599 --> 00:54:05.510
to it. I started looking into ancient Norse,
Nidhogg style. I saw what the translation for

00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:09.897
Thursday was, and it wasn't exactly Thordak, but
it sounded like it. So I decided to throw it in

00:54:09.897 --> 00:54:12.949
there because I thought it would be a fun little
joke to myself, and when people picked up on it I

00:54:12.949 --> 00:54:18.666
was like, "Oh my god! I love you guys so much for
finding that!" I can't think of anything else.

00:54:19.156 --> 00:54:23.415
MARISHA: I was going to say that kaitiaki was a
word that I picked up on when I was in New

00:54:23.415 --> 00:54:34.995
Zealand. It's a Maori word that means leader,
respect, guardian, and I was like, "That's

00:54:34.995 --> 00:54:40.436
perfect!" So I appropriated it. Classic white
person.

00:54:40.436 --> 00:54:48.757
(laughter)

00:54:48.757 --> 00:54:50.498
LAURA: And that's how we end our panel.

00:54:52.158 --> 00:54:57.339
ORGANIZER: I'd like to thank you for being here.
We all enjoy having you here.

00:54:57.339 --> 00:55:01.851
(cheering)

00:55:01.851 --> 00:55:07.166
ORGANIZER: Everyone wants to talk with you guys.
If you can, please go out that exit if you would

00:55:07.166 --> 00:55:10.395
like to see them. Hopefully they can wait
outside.

00:55:10.395 --> 00:55:11.798
LAURA: Oh no, we're not--

00:55:11.798 --> 00:55:13.330
ORGANIZER: You're leaving.

00:55:13.330 --> 00:55:15.926
LAURA: Yeah, we might-- yeah, but we can't--

00:55:15.926 --> 00:55:21.030
ORGANIZER: Oh, I know, but if anything we need to
clear out the panel so that the next panel can

00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:21.921
come through.

00:55:21.921 --> 00:55:25.887
MATT: We'll come by and see if we can shake hands
really fast. A bunch of us have to leave for

00:55:25.887 --> 00:55:29.577
another event this evening, but we're going to
come out and try to say hi to everyone.

00:55:29.583 --> 00:56:02.397
