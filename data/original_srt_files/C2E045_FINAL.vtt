NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.216
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:03.216 --> 00:00:05.696
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:05.696 --> 00:00:08.005
TRAVIS: We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:11.069
LIAM: We should just get a sound cue for that at
this point.

00:00:11.069 --> 00:00:12.886
TRAVIS: It's expected now.

00:00:12.886 --> 00:00:16.020
MATT: It's like our version of (air horn).

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.205
LIAM: (like an air horn) Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:19.205 --> 00:00:22.127
MATT: Before we get started, we have some
announcements to get to. First and foremost, we

00:00:22.127 --> 00:00:27.206
have two fantastic sponsors tonight: our fantastic
friends from D&amp;D Beyond return. Sam?

00:00:27.206 --> 00:00:33.578
SAM: D&amp;D Beyond, what a year of sponsorship from
D&amp;D Beyond! They've been with us all campaign

00:00:33.578 --> 00:00:41.559
long, all year long, and to thank them for such a
wonderful 2018, I thought I would give them a

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:51.813
gift, an ad that will hopefully live on forever.
I'm calling it My Christmas Gif. You heard that

00:00:51.813 --> 00:00:56.097
right. It's not a Christmas gift, it's a Christmas
GIF.

00:00:56.097 --> 00:00:57.691
TRAVIS: How do you make the letter F with your
hands?

00:00:57.691 --> 00:00:58.874
SAM: GIF.

00:00:58.874 --> 00:01:00.020
TRAVIS: Nope!

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:08.707
SAM: These are two Cs. Or "Jiff" if you want to
say it wrong. Here's how it's going to work: I

00:01:08.707 --> 00:01:14.052
don't know how to make a GIF or a "Jiff," but you
fine Critters out there do. So what I'm going to

00:01:14.052 --> 00:01:20.281
do is do some movements, some reactions, some
acting, and hopefully be joined by some fellow

00:01:20.281 --> 00:01:24.828
cast members. The crew's going to bring out a
green screen and we're going to do this over there

00:01:24.828 --> 00:01:31.134
at this camera. You guys will be encouraged to add
your own backgrounds to make this something

00:01:31.134 --> 00:01:36.209
memorable that can live online so that when you're
going through the Twitters or the Reddits or the

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:39.384
"Im-i-gurrs", I don't know what that is,
"Im-gurr"?

00:01:39.384 --> 00:01:40.678
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Imgur.

00:01:40.678 --> 00:01:49.081
SAM: Thank you. I'm an old man! When you're going
through the Giphys, maybe you'll come across one

00:01:49.081 --> 00:01:55.930
of these bad boys that we're going to create live,
right now, and then send some love to D&amp;D Beyond.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:02.377
I'll act one out. I'm going to go over here to
this camera, Matt, if you'll excuse me for one second--

00:02:02.386 --> 00:02:03.391
MATT: Okay.

00:02:03.391 --> 00:02:05.351
MARISHA: We're really doing this?

00:02:05.351 --> 00:02:07.231
SAM: Okay, we're making some GIFs, right here.

00:02:07.231 --> 00:02:10.523
MARISHA: I can't believe you guys are doing this
for him. Max!

00:02:10.523 --> 00:02:18.142
SAM: Okay. We're making GIFs. You guys will turn
this into a GIF later that will live on forever.

00:02:18.142 --> 00:02:23.785
There's lots of GIFs to choose from. I'm going to
do one. You know the guy who blinks who is like,

00:02:23.785 --> 00:02:30.833
"Hmm, that's weird?" I'm going to do that. Okay,
ready? And action. (humming) Okay! Someone will

00:02:30.833 --> 00:02:40.184
make that into a GIF! Taliesin, do you want to
make one?

00:02:40.184 --> 00:02:41.940
TALIESIN: Oh god, not really.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.477
SAM: I'll direct you.

00:02:43.477 --> 00:02:45.820
TALIESIN: Okay. No. How are you doing this?

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.760
SAM: Here, I'll hold this so you can just act.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.046
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:02:50.046 --> 00:02:53.683
SAM: There's a lot of applause GIFs out there, so
why don't you do an applause or a praising type

00:02:53.683 --> 00:02:55.671
GIF? Ready? And action!

00:02:55.671 --> 00:03:00.089
TALIESIN: Yes, yes, yes.

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:05.513
SAM: Okay, that was so good. Laura, come on. This
is going great, guys!

00:03:08.563 --> 00:03:13.818
There's a lot of fail GIFs, right? There's
fail GIFs everywhere, right? So why don't we do

00:03:14.045 --> 00:03:22.020
one where you're rolling a dice and oh, it sucked,
or something like that, I don't know. Let's see that.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.503
(groaning)

00:03:24.503 --> 00:03:28.510
SAM: That was good. I think we need a take-two.
You've got to get your hand up here.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.675
LAURA: That was--

00:03:30.675 --> 00:03:39.466
SAM: Damn it, didn't work. Matt, do you want to
come do one? No, these are all innocent GIFs. You

00:03:39.466 --> 00:03:44.235
know how sometimes on Twitter you see a GIF where
it's like <i>this</i>. Like, "What that commenter said,

00:03:44.235 --> 00:03:52.724
"I agree." Just do that, just point up and be like
"Yeah!" Yeah! Right? Yeah! That's a GIF right

00:03:52.724 --> 00:04:01.703
there! We just made a GIF! Last but not least,
I'll do one, I'll do a success one where a d20

00:04:01.703 --> 00:04:07.475
comes rolling in and knocks me out of the frame or
something, I don't know, we'll figure it out later!

00:04:07.475 --> 00:04:10.135
TRAVIS: What about dramatic prairie dog?

00:04:10.135 --> 00:04:12.175
SAM: Oh, yeah, that's a good one.

00:04:12.175 --> 00:04:16.854
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: ♫ Bum bum <i>bum</i>! ♫

00:04:16.854 --> 00:04:20.695
SAM: That's it! That's a wrap! Thanks, guys!

00:04:20.695 --> 00:04:23.913
(applause)

00:04:23.913 --> 00:04:27.011
TALIESIN: Well done. Good call, Travis.

00:04:27.011 --> 00:04:28.169
MARISHA: Yeah!

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:31.090
MATT: Thank you, Sam.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.607
SAM: That worked so well.

00:04:32.607 --> 00:04:37.724
MATT: And thank you, D&amp;D Beyond, for being our
fantastic partner through this campaign. Speaking

00:04:37.724 --> 00:04:43.203
of partners, we have a partner sponsor tonight as
well, our returning friends from Rook &amp; Raven.

00:04:43.203 --> 00:04:48.201
They've been with us before, they return tonight.
Creators of the handcrafted, high-quality,

00:04:48.201 --> 00:04:53.254
disc-bound notebooks that you've seen for your
campaign notes, your character notes. They design

00:04:53.254 --> 00:04:55.928
them for all sorts of role-playing games. There
you go with the Mischief and Misadventure one

00:04:55.928 --> 00:05:01.222
there. The work is fantastic. For the month of
December, The Rook &amp; The Raven is donating 100% of

00:05:01.222 --> 00:05:06.289
their profits to schools, teachers, and community
centers to help grow gaming clubs and classes

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:10.421
through their Adventure Club Gaming Kits. They're
going to be putting everything together and making

00:05:10.421 --> 00:05:17.757
sure that these schools and the facilities have
the necessary materials to help facilitate gaming

00:05:18.067 --> 00:05:21.566
clubs and getting these kids together to build the
strong bonds that I did as a kid, and I'm glad to

00:05:21.566 --> 00:05:26.482
see that expanding and they're making that happen.
Go ahead and give the gift of gaming now by

00:05:26.482 --> 00:05:30.044
helping support their work and thus, support these
kids as well at

00:05:30.044 --> 00:05:33.534
TheRookAndTheRaven.com/CriticalRole.

00:05:33.534 --> 00:05:39.416
TRAVIS: Nice! That's so cool.

00:05:39.416 --> 00:05:43.302
MATT: I think it's badass. I love that that is a
thing that can happen now. I get messages from a

00:05:43.302 --> 00:05:45.791
lot of people saying they have gaming clubs at
their schools and now there's too many kids

00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:55.682
playing and like-- that's so-- yay. That's such a
surreal reality; I'm so happy about that. We also

00:05:55.682 --> 00:06:02.464
have some other big announcements this week that
we put up. First off, we have a fantastic art show

00:06:02.464 --> 00:06:07.028
coming up soon. You guys had a chance to see the
art book, the Vox Machina final campaign art book,

00:06:07.028 --> 00:06:11.001
now we get to announce that we have our very first
art show to celebrate the fantastic art community

00:06:11.001 --> 00:06:16.383
that's come out of Critical Role. Each piece of
art was created by community artists, curated by

00:06:16.383 --> 00:06:22.096
us. Tickets for the opening reception will be
available this coming Monday, December 17th, and

00:06:22.096 --> 00:06:25.078
are completely free, and that's just for the
reception. You don't need tickets for the two

00:06:25.078 --> 00:06:30.098
other days. The exhibit will be open through
January 20th. You can stop over at any point in

00:06:30.098 --> 00:06:35.562
the weekend if you missed the actual reception
event. It's going to be there. It's going to be at

00:06:35.562 --> 00:06:41.160
Gallery Nucleus. You can find out all the
information for that at CritRole.com. We also

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:47.753
announced that on Saturday, January 19th, that
same weekend, we are doing a return to Vox Machina

00:06:47.753 --> 00:06:50.152
one-shot, our first campaign.

00:06:50.152 --> 00:06:52.905
LAURA: I'm so excited!

00:06:52.905 --> 00:06:59.282
MATT: It's going to be the Search for Grog. For
those, no spoilers, but towards the <i>very</i> end of

00:06:59.282 --> 00:07:06.857
the campaign, something happened, one of our
players pulled a thing from a deck of

00:07:06.857 --> 00:07:14.568
thingy-things and briefly derailed a lot of
things, and we just glossed over it. We're

00:07:14.568 --> 00:07:21.254
actually going to play through that adventure as a
one-shot with all the returning members of Vox

00:07:21.254 --> 00:07:26.399
Machina but two, because Grog is being sought
after and another character will not be present.

00:07:26.399 --> 00:07:28.576
TRAVIS: (as Grog) I couldn't help it, I'm sorry!

00:07:28.576 --> 00:07:30.649
MATT: We could make it, you know--

00:07:30.649 --> 00:07:33.204
LIAM: Well, Travis, some might say that you were
forward thinking.

00:07:33.204 --> 00:07:33.871
TRAVIS: Ooh!

00:07:33.871 --> 00:07:40.008
MATT: Super excited about this one-shot and to
bring us back into the world of Vox Machina. VIP

00:07:40.008 --> 00:07:44.326
tickets go on sale this Saturday, December 15th,
and general admission which goes on sale on

00:07:44.326 --> 00:07:50.494
Sunday, December 16th. VIP attendees will have a
special swag bag, including a signed Vox Machina

00:07:50.494 --> 00:07:56.046
print by the whole cast, as well as a special Q&amp;A
with Brian before the show. It's got a lot of fun

00:07:56.046 --> 00:07:59.731
stuff. Once again, go to CritRole.com for all the
info. We look forward to seeing you guys there.

00:07:59.731 --> 00:08:01.492
(cheering)

00:08:01.492 --> 00:08:03.234
TALIESIN: Hosted by Brian Wayne Foster.

00:08:03.234 --> 00:08:07.194
MATT: Yes. Also, be sure to join us next week for
our very special holiday one-shot, that is being

00:08:07.194 --> 00:08:09.503
DMed by our fantastic Liam O'Brien.

00:08:09.503 --> 00:08:14.206
LIAM: Ha! Ha! Oh my gosh! I'm so excited! I've had
this idea in my head for two years!

00:08:14.206 --> 00:08:15.516
TRAVIS: You have, that's right!

00:08:15.516 --> 00:08:20.431
LIAM: Two years! I wanted to do it last Christmas!
I'm mostly ready. We'll see what happens.

00:08:20.431 --> 00:08:25.054
MATT: I was not expecting that much exuberance out
of you. I am twice as pumped now for this, just

00:08:25.054 --> 00:08:27.611
from that. That was adorable!

00:08:27.611 --> 00:08:31.012
LIAM: It's going to be fun! It's going to be so
much fun!

00:08:31.012 --> 00:08:37.039
MATT: It's called The Night Before Critmas. It'll
air on Friday, December 21st at 7:00pm, so Friday

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:45.013
next week, to kick off the holidays right. 7:00pm
Pacific at twitch.tv/criticalrole. Last but not

00:08:45.013 --> 00:08:50.699
least, we also have our very special end of the
year State of the Role tomorrow, which will give

00:08:50.699 --> 00:08:55.525
you more insight into our holiday programming
schedule, a few fun things that we have coming in

00:08:55.525 --> 00:09:00.393
2019. You can check out all the details tomorrow
morning at CritRole.com and probably posted across

00:09:00.393 --> 00:09:05.230
our socials, so keep an eye out for that. I think
that's it?

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:07.447
TRAVIS: Yeah, four pages of notes, I think you got
it.

00:09:07.447 --> 00:09:13.630
MATT: Yeah, it was a hefty one, it was a big one.
On that note, my friends, let's go ahead and dive

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:19.733
into tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:09:19.733 --> 00:09:26.423
(no audio)

00:09:26.423 --> 00:09:29.863
(chanting) Role! Critical! Role!

00:09:29.863 --> 00:09:43.105
[dramatic Critical Role theme]

00:09:43.105 --> 00:09:51.797
LAURA: Roll the dice! (singing) The adventure
begins, they were always beside you, your nerdy

00:09:51.797 --> 00:09:58.854
best friends, and the DM to guide you. And they
rise from the flames for the battles ahead.

00:09:58.854 --> 00:10:02.960
Villains beware 'cause you're about to be dead.

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:07.610
(music)

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:12.702
ASHLEY: (singing) They got magic and flair, they
got falchions and cunning. They don't see over

00:10:12.702 --> 00:10:20.461
there there's a monster incoming. Inspiration is
waiting, rise up, don't think twice. Put your fate

00:10:20.461 --> 00:10:24.391
in your hands, take a chance, roll the dice!

00:10:24.391 --> 00:10:32.249
(chanting) Role! Critical! Role!

00:10:32.249 --> 00:10:37.737
ASHLEY and LAURA: (singing) Can you answer the
call? Diggin' deep in your soul as the legend

00:10:37.737 --> 00:10:47.256
unfolds. Now it's your turn to roll!

00:10:47.256 --> 00:10:55.769
[fire burning]

00:10:55.769 --> 00:11:06.833
MATT: Welcome back. That was adorable, Laura. Last
we left off: The Mighty Nein, after spending an

00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:12.987
exorbitant period of time at sea at the behest of
Captain Avantika, on the ship the Squalleater, got

00:11:12.987 --> 00:11:18.728
pulled into piracy under the banner of The
Revelry, brought to the pirate city and island of

00:11:18.728 --> 00:11:25.802
Darktow amongst the Dragshallow Reefs. There, you
uncovered information, proof that she had plans to

00:11:25.802 --> 00:11:30.671
overthrow the Plank King and rule the seas, along
with her fanatical obsession with Uk'otoa.

00:11:30.671 --> 00:11:32.034
ALL: (whispering) Uk'otoa!

00:11:32.034 --> 00:11:39.198
MATT: I knew it was coming. You manage to dodge
through the night, grab the necessary journal,

00:11:39.198 --> 00:11:44.955
uncover the information through the cipher, and
through a scuffle, survive this fiery battle on

00:11:44.955 --> 00:11:50.964
the docks from the ship. Through some tactical use
of spells and quick members of your party, you got

00:11:50.964 --> 00:11:56.712
it in the hands of the Plank King. Judgement was
brought between the two of you at the dock, and he

00:11:56.712 --> 00:12:08.592
chose Avantika to go. Upon having her make her
leave, violently, gave you guys your reward, which

00:12:08.592 --> 00:12:13.212
was sparing your lives and telling you to get the
fuck out of Darktow and never come back. You were

00:12:13.212 --> 00:12:20.800
gifted the hobbled, burned form of the Squalleater
and left to make your way out towards the ocean

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:29.500
where you attempted to search into the backstory
of Fjord's relationship with his patron, in search

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:36.212
of one of what seems to be the third and final
sphere. You made your way down into the wreckage

00:12:36.212 --> 00:12:41.386
of his ship, The Tide's Breadth, and discovered it
was one of many in what was called the Diver's

00:12:41.386 --> 00:12:47.602
Grave, a ship graveyard here in the center of the
Lucidian Ocean. In trying to find out where this

00:12:47.602 --> 00:12:55.218
orb went, you were drawn into the underwater lair
of Dashilla the Dreadful. You encountered spirits

00:12:55.218 --> 00:13:02.415
of long-dead sailors bound there by her magic. You
discovered the essence of how she's able to

00:13:02.415 --> 00:13:10.470
maintain this graveyard and draw ships down below.
While she managed to flee before being killed, you

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:14.712
grabbed what you were looking for, fled to the
surface, and with your ship, escaped the growing

00:13:14.712 --> 00:13:23.862
storm before any more danger was brought to you.
That was where we left off. Mighty Nein, as you've

00:13:23.862 --> 00:13:30.052
all gathered your things, you can hear the distant
crack of thunder as the storm gets smaller behind

00:13:30.052 --> 00:13:34.144
you on the horizon. What do you want to do?

00:13:34.144 --> 00:13:42.164
TRAVIS: Should we go back down and just push the
button, just make sure that we're wiped out once

00:13:42.411 --> 00:13:50.179
and for all? I'm kidding. We should make our way
over to the Bisaft Isle, right? Need repairs?

00:13:50.179 --> 00:13:51.482
SAM: Yes.

00:13:51.482 --> 00:13:52.847
TRAVIS: That would be the thing to do.

00:13:52.847 --> 00:13:55.591
LAURA: We are pretty hurt here.

00:13:55.591 --> 00:13:59.523
TRAVIS: Yeah, how's everybody feeling, by the
way? Are we damaged, beat up? We all right?

00:13:59.523 --> 00:14:02.217
LAURA: Nothing that a good night's rest won't
help.

00:14:02.217 --> 00:14:04.198
TALIESIN: Or two... three.

00:14:04.198 --> 00:14:06.997
SAM: How many days will it be sailing?

00:14:06.997 --> 00:14:09.466
TRAVIS: I'd estimate probably three or four.

00:14:09.466 --> 00:14:11.188
MATT: Three or four days from where you are now.

00:14:11.188 --> 00:14:13.078
SAM: You got it right!

00:14:13.078 --> 00:14:20.242
TRAVIS: Believe! You hear that? Holy shit, I got
it right! As I was saying. Orly, if you would,

00:14:20.242 --> 00:14:22.641
please plot us a course to the Bisaft Isle.

00:14:22.641 --> 00:14:30.564
MATT: "Of course, don't you worry." He goes ahead
and sets course. The ship makes its turn across

00:14:30.564 --> 00:14:34.576
the water in the direction of the Bisaft Isle.

00:14:34.576 --> 00:14:36.826
MARISHA: Bishaft?

00:14:36.826 --> 00:14:38.020
TRAVIS: Bisaft.

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:40.130
SAM: (singing) Bishaft, ah!

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:42.354
TRAVIS: No H, it's Bisaft!

00:14:42.354 --> 00:14:44.254
MARISHA: It's made of fucking cookies.

00:14:44.254 --> 00:14:45.235
MATT: Bisaft.

00:14:45.235 --> 00:14:47.196
SAM: Biscotti?

00:14:47.196 --> 00:14:48.238
MATT: Yes.

00:14:48.238 --> 00:14:50.444
TALIESIN: Biscotti Islands.

00:14:50.444 --> 00:14:55.373
MATT: To that degree, you guys have a few days of
travel, anything you'd like to accomplish in this

00:14:55.373 --> 00:14:59.605
time? You've taken a long rest for the first
evening. You're restored if you need to restore

00:14:59.605 --> 00:15:00.930
your spells and hit points.

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:02.740
SAM: I have a small list.

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:04.498
MATT: What is your small list, Nott?

00:15:04.498 --> 00:15:10.790
SAM: Okay, you said that we have some cannons
aboard. Do we have gunpowder?

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:11.677
MATT: Yes.

00:15:11.677 --> 00:15:20.574
SAM: Okay. I would like to fashion, if I can,
three more explosive arrowheads for myself, if possible?

00:15:21.201 --> 00:15:21.979
MATT: Sure!

00:15:21.979 --> 00:15:23.394
SAM: Or attempt to.

00:15:23.394 --> 00:15:29.420
MATT: Sure, let's do it. Let's give it a shot.
Roll a tinkering check.

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.167
SAM: Three times?

00:15:31.167 --> 00:15:33.245
TRAVIS: Can you do that up in the crow's nest,
please?

00:15:33.245 --> 00:15:35.855
SAM: Right in the belly of the ship.

00:15:35.855 --> 00:15:39.783
MATT: Are you proficient with the tinker's tools?

00:15:39.783 --> 00:15:46.868
SAM: I have tinker's tools. Where do I see--

00:15:46.868 --> 00:15:48.567
LAURA: How can you tell if you're proficient?

00:15:48.567 --> 00:15:50.311
MATT: It's under your proficiencies.

00:15:50.311 --> 00:15:52.264
TRAVIS: Yeah, which on D&amp;D Beyond--

00:15:52.264 --> 00:15:53.698
LAURA: Oh, proficiencies and languages.

00:15:53.698 --> 00:15:54.931
SAM: Where's that?

00:15:54.931 --> 00:15:56.533
LAURA: Scroll up... no.

00:15:56.533 --> 00:16:00.288
SAM: Nope. But I am good with chemistry.

00:16:00.288 --> 00:16:01.448
MATT: You are!

00:16:01.448 --> 00:16:02.822
SAM: Which is part of the deal.

00:16:02.822 --> 00:16:05.038
LAURA: Alchemist's supplies.

00:16:05.038 --> 00:16:10.967
MATT: It's already powder. It's already explosive.
You're just constructing a casing and a means of

00:16:10.967 --> 00:16:15.197
detonation. Just roll and add your dexterity
modifier.

00:16:15.197 --> 00:16:16.453
SAM: Three times?

00:16:16.453 --> 00:16:17.166
MATT: Yes.

00:16:17.166 --> 00:16:25.705
SAM: All right. Two, 11, 13! Plus four. So 17, 15,
low.

00:16:25.705 --> 00:16:28.374
MATT: Okay. You make two.

00:16:28.374 --> 00:16:30.267
SAM: Hey! That's great.

00:16:30.267 --> 00:16:31.704
MATT: The third one...

00:16:31.704 --> 00:16:33.076
SAM: Oh no.

00:16:33.076 --> 00:16:36.177
MATT: In the crow's nest, as Fjord--

00:16:36.177 --> 00:16:38.389
SAM: No, I'm down near the cannons.

00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:39.426
MATT: Okay.

00:16:39.426 --> 00:16:41.427
SAM: That's where the gunpowder is.

00:16:41.427 --> 00:16:43.100
TRAVIS: Why would you be anywhere else?

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.027
TALIESIN: Literally the first thing they teach
you.

00:16:45.027 --> 00:16:51.468
MATT: The first one goes by easy as heck. You're
proud of yourself. Second one, a little tenuous,

00:16:51.468 --> 00:16:57.040
but you manage to craft it, and that's nice. The
third one, roll a perception check.

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.427
SAM: Three!

00:16:58.427 --> 00:17:01.609
LAURA: Plus what?

00:17:01.609 --> 00:17:03.100
SAM: Plus zero.

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:04.473
LAURA: Oh no.

00:17:04.473 --> 00:17:11.482
MATT: You, in all the excitement, and your mind's
eye focusing entirely on all the wonderful

00:17:11.482 --> 00:17:18.465
explosions this is going to cause, aren't paying
attention to the wire you're using to seal off

00:17:18.465 --> 00:17:27.777
where the head of the explosive bolt goes. As you
pull, through a series of lucky circumstances, a

00:17:27.777 --> 00:17:36.793
spark gets hit. There's a brief moment where you
hear that (hissing) and you're like "Oh!" There's

00:17:36.793 --> 00:17:40.413
just a flash. Roll a dexterity check for me-- a
dexterity saving throw.

00:17:40.413 --> 00:17:41.629
SAM: Two!

00:17:41.629 --> 00:17:45.488
LAURA: It's at an angle! Move your fucking thing!

00:17:45.488 --> 00:17:46.802
SAM: It is at an angle.

00:17:46.802 --> 00:17:48.400
MATT: It's still a two, though. Plus?

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:56.366
SAM: Plus seven, but wait! Don't I have something
on dexterity saves where I can--

00:17:56.366 --> 00:17:57.555
LAURA: You get advantage?

00:17:57.555 --> 00:18:01.078
SAM: I don't know. Don't I have something? I
should know my shit!

00:18:01.078 --> 00:18:03.816
MATT: You really should!

00:18:03.816 --> 00:18:05.878
MARISHA: You have evasion.

00:18:05.878 --> 00:18:12.659
SAM: What's evasion? It's an area effect! So if
it's a big explosion, maybe?

00:18:12.659 --> 00:18:16.990
MATT: Correct! Unless your cloak gives you
advantage on dexterity saving throws?

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:17.682
SAM: No.

00:18:17.682 --> 00:18:19.819
TRAVIS: Can you uncanny dodge a shitty dex roll?

00:18:19.819 --> 00:18:22.077
LIAM: If you fail, it's half damage, not full
damage.

00:18:22.077 --> 00:18:24.218
MATT: Correct. So you failed.

00:18:24.218 --> 00:18:25.034
SAM: Okay.

00:18:25.034 --> 00:18:28.927
LIAM: Hello! I hear you're trying to do a rogue
action.

00:18:28.927 --> 00:18:35.985
MATT: In that explosion, 13 points of fire damage
you suffer, halved because of your evasion trait,

00:18:35.985 --> 00:18:42.629
so that'll put us at six. You take six points of
fire damage as there's this brief explosion that

00:18:42.629 --> 00:18:46.997
rocks the vicinity and your ears ring. You grab
the sides of your face as your eyes attempt to

00:18:47.294 --> 00:18:54.605
focus. In that brief instant, you see a shape move
through the center of the galley.

00:18:54.605 --> 00:18:57.344
MARISHA: What?

00:18:57.344 --> 00:18:59.676
TRAVIS: We have a fucking stowaway.

00:18:59.676 --> 00:19:08.120
SAM: Oh shit! First of all, am I singed? Did the
other arrows-- Is everything safe? Is anything

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:10.388
else going to blow up? Any other fire?

00:19:10.388 --> 00:19:12.647
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:19:12.647 --> 00:19:14.005
SAM: Six!

00:19:14.005 --> 00:19:17.516
MATT: Everything seems safe!

00:19:17.516 --> 00:19:19.832
MARISHA: Just get them all out.

00:19:19.832 --> 00:19:23.293
TRAVIS: Caleb! Jester! Beau! Everybody, below
decks! Find out what that was!

00:19:23.293 --> 00:19:25.326
SAM: No, everything's fine!

00:19:25.326 --> 00:19:26.452
TRAVIS: That you, Nott?

00:19:26.452 --> 00:19:28.320
SAM: I'll climb up. It's okay!

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:29.778
TRAVIS: What did you do?

00:19:29.778 --> 00:19:33.546
MATT: As you guys look up, you can see this
smattering of dark soot all across her face. The

00:19:33.546 --> 00:19:34.745
hair's scattered.

00:19:34.745 --> 00:19:38.346
LAURA: Oh no, Nott! Are you injured?

00:19:38.346 --> 00:19:45.119
SAM: There was a booby trap set by Avantika! But I
found it and disarmed it! It's all right. We're

00:19:45.119 --> 00:19:46.989
safe now.

00:19:46.989 --> 00:19:49.469
TRAVIS: I'm glad you survived. There's a lot of
gunpowder down there!

00:19:49.469 --> 00:19:54.100
SAM: I know. I was just making sure that we were
safe and we definitely are now!

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.156
LAURA: Cure Wounds.

00:19:56.156 --> 00:19:58.841
SAM: Thank you!

00:19:58.841 --> 00:20:02.712
LIAM: Do you need to have any company below?

00:20:02.712 --> 00:20:09.055
SAM: No, I'll be okay below. But Beauregard?

00:20:09.055 --> 00:20:09.586
MARISHA: Yeah?

00:20:09.586 --> 00:20:14.947
SAM: In Halfling, I will say to her: There's
someone hiding downstairs. We need to act fast,

00:20:14.947 --> 00:20:20.779
but don't alert the others yet; they'll overreact!
You and I are the calm and steady ones. We can

00:20:20.779 --> 00:20:21.729
deal with this.

00:20:21.729 --> 00:20:24.504
TRAVIS: Nott! What is coming out of your mouth
right now?

00:20:24.504 --> 00:20:25.563
SAM: Sorry.

00:20:25.563 --> 00:20:28.142
MARISHA: We were saying our daily prayers.

00:20:28.142 --> 00:20:29.925
TRAVIS: Y'all have daily prayers?

00:20:29.925 --> 00:20:32.943
MARISHA: Yeah, it's called, "Get the fuck out of
our business."

00:20:32.943 --> 00:20:35.909
TRAVIS: That's a lot of heat.

00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:40.164
MARISHA: Sorry. I've been on a boat for a very
long time.

00:20:40.164 --> 00:20:49.961
SAM: I just don't want us to all go down there and
scare away whatever it is-- oh, no I'm still in Halfling!

00:20:50.679 --> 00:21:01.716
MARISHA: You're sure we shouldn't let Fjord know?
Or we should just handle it?

00:21:01.716 --> 00:21:02.846
SAM: What do you think?

00:21:02.846 --> 00:21:04.345
MARISHA: Do we kill them?

00:21:04.345 --> 00:21:06.764
SAM: Who, Fjord?! He hasn't done anything to us!

00:21:06.764 --> 00:21:07.636
MARISHA: No!

00:21:07.636 --> 00:21:10.594
TALIESIN: Ah, I heard your name. Whatever they're
saying, I heard your name.

00:21:10.594 --> 00:21:14.324
TRAVIS: Yeah, right? You heard that; it was like:
(gibberish) Fjord (gibberish).

00:21:14.324 --> 00:21:16.594
SAM: I don't know how to translate it!

00:21:16.594 --> 00:21:22.589
LIAM: Caleb starts speaking in Zemnian: What are
we doing? What are you talking about? This seems

00:21:22.589 --> 00:21:24.224
rude to me! What is going on?

00:21:24.224 --> 00:21:26.027
TALIESIN: What language were you speaking?

00:21:26.027 --> 00:21:26.872
LIAM: Zemnian.

00:21:26.872 --> 00:21:28.899
TALIESIN: Goddamn it, I don't know that one.

00:21:28.899 --> 00:21:30.876
SAM: Gather close, everyone.

00:21:30.876 --> 00:21:32.761
LAURA: I gather in Infernal.

00:21:32.761 --> 00:21:36.284
(laughter)

00:21:36.284 --> 00:21:45.306
SAM: In Common: there might be someone down below,
hiding. In my exploration, I might have seen a

00:21:45.306 --> 00:21:49.482
shape moving down there. I don't want us to go
charging down there and blow up--!

00:21:49.482 --> 00:21:51.420
LAURA: (shouting) It's the Traveler!

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:53.595
SAM: Shh! Not too loud!

00:21:53.595 --> 00:21:56.809
TRAVIS: Are you sure there are no more booby traps
below?

00:21:56.809 --> 00:22:04.561
SAM: I don't think so. This one was very specific
in its design, seemed to be a one-of-a-kind thing,

00:22:04.561 --> 00:22:05.451
I hope.

00:22:05.451 --> 00:22:09.717
TRAVIS: Can you go back down there? Take Beau,
Jester with you, and we will stay up here to make

00:22:09.717 --> 00:22:14.849
sure they don't get by you on the way out, but you
need to find whomever or whatever that was and

00:22:14.849 --> 00:22:16.045
isolate it.

00:22:16.045 --> 00:22:17.811
SAM: Isolate!

00:22:17.811 --> 00:22:18.662
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:22:18.662 --> 00:22:20.323
SAM: Contain!

00:22:20.323 --> 00:22:21.675
TRAVIS: Exactly.

00:22:21.675 --> 00:22:22.774
SAM: Kill!

00:22:22.774 --> 00:22:25.310
LAURA: What if it's Vera? Do you think it could be
Vera?

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:26.492
SAM: Didn't she die?

00:22:26.492 --> 00:22:30.652
TRAVIS: No, she didn't. She was in shackles next
to the ogre, right?

00:22:30.652 --> 00:22:37.745
MATT: No, last you saw Vera she was burned pretty
bad.

00:22:37.745 --> 00:22:40.864
LIAM: He was vague about his wording at that
moment.

00:22:40.864 --> 00:22:45.482
TRAVIS: But! Isolate and contain, go now!

00:22:45.482 --> 00:22:47.258
MARISHA: (quick footsteps)

00:22:47.258 --> 00:22:47.967
LAURA: Okay!

00:22:47.967 --> 00:22:49.977
TALIESIN: Try not to do it-- well--

00:22:49.977 --> 00:22:54.574
MARISHA: Before I go down I go: Fjord. Sorry for
being a dick. Then just go.

00:22:54.574 --> 00:22:55.917
TRAVIS: Apologies.

00:22:55.917 --> 00:22:57.650
TALIESIN: That's an improvement.

00:22:57.650 --> 00:22:58.632
TRAVIS: Growth.

00:22:58.632 --> 00:22:59.959
TALIESIN: That's impressive.

00:22:59.959 --> 00:23:02.104
TRAVIS: (singing) Character arc!

00:23:02.104 --> 00:23:04.361
TALIESIN: Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

00:23:04.361 --> 00:23:05.699
MATT: Beau and Nott?

00:23:05.699 --> 00:23:07.130
SAM: You said Jester, too.

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:07.805
LAURA: Me too!

00:23:07.805 --> 00:23:11.467
TALIESIN: I'm going stay and keep an eye out on
deck.

00:23:11.467 --> 00:23:18.837
MATT: The three of you head down past the galley,
or the kitchen where you originally saw the shape

00:23:18.921 --> 00:23:29.821
move. You're now towards the center where the
cannons and the accessible stores of gunpowder

00:23:29.821 --> 00:23:36.119
are. You guys can see the scarring mark on the
wood there where the previous explosion happened.

00:23:36.119 --> 00:23:44.529
SAM: (talking through his teeth) Near the galley
is where I saw the thing move.

00:23:44.529 --> 00:23:46.216
LAURA: Do I see anything?

00:23:46.216 --> 00:23:48.445
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:23:48.445 --> 00:23:52.473
SAM: Ooh, so much better then mine.

00:23:52.473 --> 00:23:53.681
LAURA: 23!

00:23:53.681 --> 00:24:05.035
MATT: Okay then. You glance past the galley; you
don't see any movement. You glance across the

00:24:05.035 --> 00:24:11.617
opposite side near where the stairway leads into
the cargo hold below. You look past and you swear

00:24:11.617 --> 00:24:16.984
you see something looking back from around one of
the barrels, then disappear behind it, and you

00:24:16.984 --> 00:24:18.531
hear (light footsteps).

00:24:18.531 --> 00:24:21.497
LAURA: Hey! Hello? We saw you.

00:24:21.497 --> 00:24:25.604
SAM: Is there a way to flank around behind
wherever that shape was?

00:24:25.604 --> 00:24:30.177
MATT: It's possible. Where you saw it was right
next to the stairs that lead down into the cargo

00:24:30.177 --> 00:24:36.597
hold. Whatever the shape was, it moved behind one
of the large barrels there, made a run for it,

00:24:36.597 --> 00:24:39.263
hoping it wouldn't be seen, and then went
downstairs.

00:24:39.263 --> 00:24:40.675
LAURA: Downstairs.

00:24:40.675 --> 00:24:41.863
MARISHA: It went downstairs?

00:24:41.863 --> 00:24:43.318
MATT: Into the cargo hold, yes.

00:24:43.318 --> 00:24:44.692
LAURA and MARISHA: Let's go.

00:24:44.692 --> 00:24:50.049
MARISHA: Yeah, we go downstairs. I quietly dart
forward to block off the path.

00:24:50.049 --> 00:24:54.257
MATT: Okay, so blocking off the area. Everyone
make a stealth check, please.

00:24:54.257 --> 00:24:55.376
SAM: Hood up.

00:24:55.376 --> 00:24:57.977
LAURA: Oh! (whispering) I bless you!

00:24:57.977 --> 00:24:59.556
MARISHA: (whispering) Okay. What is it?

00:24:59.556 --> 00:25:00.823
LAURA: (whispering) You get advantage.

00:25:00.823 --> 00:25:02.384
MARISHA: (whispering) Oh, that's cool.

00:25:02.384 --> 00:25:03.649
LAURA: (whispering) Oh, natural one.

00:25:03.649 --> 00:25:07.703
MARISHA: Natural 20! Thanks for that blessing!

00:25:07.703 --> 00:25:09.596
LAURA: Bless you! (clattering)

00:25:09.596 --> 00:25:14.773
(laughter)

00:25:14.773 --> 00:25:15.331
SAM: 23.

00:25:15.331 --> 00:25:22.063
MATT: Okay, that tips the scales a bit, then. You
guys are quietly making your way down there,

00:25:22.063 --> 00:25:28.692
hearing the creaking of wood and the very faint,
muffled sounds of waves crashing against the

00:25:28.692 --> 00:25:35.094
outside of the Squalleater. You see a shape duck
down even further back in the cargo hold behind

00:25:35.094 --> 00:25:37.090
one of the box clusters.

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:39.124
LAURA: Can we see what it looked like?

00:25:39.124 --> 00:25:41.681
MATT: It's too far away and there's no light down
there.

00:25:41.681 --> 00:25:43.776
LAURA: Too bad I can't make light.

00:25:43.776 --> 00:25:46.235
SAM: Why did he send us three?

00:25:46.235 --> 00:25:48.461
MARISHA: I put on my night-vision goggles.

00:25:48.461 --> 00:25:50.593
MATT: All of you have darkvision, as long as you
have the goggles on.

00:25:50.593 --> 00:25:54.135
SAM: Do you want me to go scare it out or
something?

00:25:54.135 --> 00:25:55.941
LAURA: Yeah.

00:25:55.941 --> 00:25:57.748
SAM: I don't know how to do that.

00:25:57.748 --> 00:26:00.976
LAURA: Oh. Me neither.

00:26:00.976 --> 00:26:03.077
MARISHA: (whispering) What? You can be scary!

00:26:03.077 --> 00:26:05.382
SAM: Ooh! Your duplicate!

00:26:05.382 --> 00:26:09.664
LAURA: Okay, I was going to say Thaumaturgy, but
yeah.

00:26:09.664 --> 00:26:10.821
SAM: Do that, too!

00:26:10.821 --> 00:26:14.404
LAURA: Okay, I use Thaumaturgy and I send-- I
don't want to use my duplicate.

00:26:14.404 --> 00:26:16.077
SAM: Just send the Thaumaturgy, then.

00:26:16.077 --> 00:26:25.247
LAURA: And I use my duplicate! I send my duplicate
where the boxes are that they are hiding behind

00:26:25.247 --> 00:26:29.655
and at the same time I use Thaumaturgy to say:
(spooky voice) There are ghosts on the ship!

00:26:29.655 --> 00:26:36.141
MARISHA: I look at Nott. (whispering) You. Me.
Flank. Let's go.

00:26:36.141 --> 00:26:37.043
SAM: Okay.

00:26:37.043 --> 00:26:38.701
SAM and MARISHA: (quick footsteps)

00:26:38.701 --> 00:26:41.224
TRAVIS: Oh good, a little Naruto run?

00:26:41.224 --> 00:26:50.150
MATT: You guys dart around, with the booming voice
of Jester's duplicitous double. There, curved

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:55.004
around the corner you manage to all at the same
time flank in this area. As you get around the

00:26:55.004 --> 00:26:58.144
space, you can see they're huddled in the corner.
If you'd like to come to the table--

00:26:58.144 --> 00:27:02.559
(cheering)

00:27:02.559 --> 00:27:04.864
MATT: And describe to them what they see.

00:27:07.444 --> 00:27:13.163
DEBORAH: Sitting in the tiniest little corner, in
the littlest ball, I have created an illusion of a

00:27:13.437 --> 00:27:20.255
halo over my head, so I look like a perfect little
angel. It's just a tiny little gnome girl. You

00:27:20.255 --> 00:27:26.493
would have no idea how old I am. I'm really cute,
and there's sticks in my hair, and I got singed a

00:27:26.493 --> 00:27:31.250
little bit, so one cheek's covered in soot. I have
really pretty necklaces.

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:32.469
LAURA: (gasps)

00:27:32.469 --> 00:27:35.922
DEBORAH: I go: Ghosts? Did you say ghosts? I'm
scared of ghosts!

00:27:35.922 --> 00:27:40.250
LAURA: (gasps) Oh! There's no ghosts, you're so
cute!

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:44.001
DEBORAH: There's chocolate smeared on my face as
well.

00:27:44.001 --> 00:27:49.139
LAURA: Come out! You're <i>so</i> cute! Is it a little
child--

00:27:49.139 --> 00:27:55.042
SAM: Jester! Fjord, said to contain! (shouting)
Get down! I'm going to point my crossbow at her.

00:27:55.042 --> 00:27:56.862
Get down! Don't say a word!

00:27:56.862 --> 00:27:59.080
LAURA: You want some candy? Come on.

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:05.802
SAM: No! This is not good cop, bad cop. We're
supposed to contain! <i>Contain!</i>

00:28:05.802 --> 00:28:17.811
DEBORAH: At this moment, I push my hand out, and
another little hand slides off of it and comes

00:28:17.811 --> 00:28:19.774
forward. It comes into your face and goes--

00:28:19.774 --> 00:28:28.314
SAM: I mean, she's so cute! How could I do that to
you? I'm so sorry!

00:28:28.314 --> 00:28:34.714
MARISHA: Okay, okay! Okay. Who the fuck are you,
though? Seriously?

00:28:34.714 --> 00:28:36.454
TRAVIS: Who the fuck are you, though?

00:28:36.454 --> 00:28:43.067
DEBORAH: I open up my little cloak and I go:
Should we tell them? Okay! I think that-- yes! No,

00:28:43.067 --> 00:28:46.947
I think they're friendly. It's okay! So I go: I'm
Twiggy! (deeper voice) This is Trixie.

00:28:46.947 --> 00:28:50.933
TRAVIS: Oh no!

00:28:50.933 --> 00:28:52.692
SAM: Whoa!

00:28:52.692 --> 00:28:58.998
DEBORAH: Trixie's my bestest friend, and we got
stuck on this ship. But I have lots of chocolate

00:28:58.998 --> 00:29:05.190
and lots of apples. As you can tell, that's <i>all</i>
I've been eating! And I wonder if it's okay if I

00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:08.483
could hang out with you guys for awhile? Until we
get to shore?

00:29:08.483 --> 00:29:12.627
SAM: What were you doing hanging out on a ship in
a pirate island?

00:29:12.627 --> 00:29:13.545
DEBORAH: Hmm!

00:29:13.545 --> 00:29:15.190
SAM: You're a little cutie pie!

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:26.499
DEBORAH: I know! So I just needed somewhere to
hide for a while, and there was this box, and it

00:29:26.499 --> 00:29:30.176
was open, and they were bringing it on a boat, so
I was like: Hey sounds like a good idea!

00:29:30.176 --> 00:29:33.342
SAM: I mean, that seems like a perfectly
reasonable explanation for me.

00:29:33.342 --> 00:29:34.568
DEBORAH: That's what I thought!

00:29:34.568 --> 00:29:35.810
LAURA: What does Trixie look like?

00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:39.688
DEBORAH: Trixie's got a big bushy tail, and a cute
little-- do you want to see?

00:29:39.688 --> 00:29:40.313
LAURA: Yeah!

00:29:40.313 --> 00:29:44.098
DEBORAH: I open up my cloak and sitting in my
pocket is the tiniest, cutest little squirrel

00:29:44.098 --> 00:29:47.222
you've ever seen, with the tiniest little nose.

00:29:47.222 --> 00:29:54.347
LAURA: Oh my gosh, Trixie would love Sprinkle! My
little crimson weasel pops out from the hood on my cloak.

00:29:54.667 --> 00:29:58.279
DEBORAH: I let Trixie run down my arm, and they
boop noses.

00:29:58.279 --> 00:29:59.604
LAURA: Oh my gosh!

00:29:59.604 --> 00:30:01.906
DEBORAH: This is a very girly game today.

00:30:01.906 --> 00:30:05.407
MARISHA: Okay, I feel like we're--

00:30:05.407 --> 00:30:10.879
SAM: I pull out my dead rabbit's foot that I have.
I have this, too! It's something.

00:30:10.879 --> 00:30:12.344
LAURA: It's so cute.

00:30:12.344 --> 00:30:20.722
MARISHA: We're letting the cuteness distract us!
Why were you hiding? Sorry, sorry. Why did you

00:30:20.722 --> 00:30:26.103
feel the need to hide? What did you do?

00:30:26.103 --> 00:30:29.823
DEBORAH: Well, I'm really nice, but I don't always
make the best decisions.

00:30:29.823 --> 00:30:31.140
MARISHA: I can relate.

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:31.727
DEBORAH: Right?

00:30:31.727 --> 00:30:32.628
MARISHA: I'm so nice.

00:30:32.628 --> 00:30:39.912
DEBORAH: Totally. I don't know. There was this
really pretty thing, and this really bad guy was

00:30:39.912 --> 00:30:44.832
going to get it. I was like, that's not fair,
right? So I took it, okay. I took it. You don't

00:30:44.832 --> 00:30:45.780
care, right?

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:47.367
LAURA: What is the pretty thing?

00:30:47.367 --> 00:30:49.314
SAM: What sort of thing?

00:30:49.314 --> 00:30:52.342
DEBORAH: I don't know, you guys. It's kind of
tricky.

00:30:52.342 --> 00:30:53.680
LAURA: Okay.

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:56.756
SAM: Do you have it?

00:30:56.756 --> 00:31:01.414
DEBORAH: Yeah. I look at you all. I say: I never
let it leave my side. I turn around and go in my

00:31:01.414 --> 00:31:05.641
bag, and I'm digging through my bag. I'm like:
It's not this, not that one. I've got all these

00:31:05.641 --> 00:31:10.979
little trinkets of things, even little drawings
that I've made and stuff like that. They're little

00:31:10.979 --> 00:31:19.184
houses and clouds and stuff. I pull out this
thing, and it's a sphere. It's made of all these

00:31:19.184 --> 00:31:23.966
intricate little puzzle pieces. I'm like: See, I
can move it around, but I'm not quite sure what it

00:31:23.966 --> 00:31:26.142
does. But it's clearly really pretty.

00:31:26.142 --> 00:31:27.484
LAURA: Can I touch it?

00:31:27.484 --> 00:31:33.354
MATT: In her gnomish hands, this is pretty large.
From your perspective, it would be about that big,

00:31:33.354 --> 00:31:38.464
but for her it seems even that much bigger. It's a
brass and golden sphere that consists of many

00:31:38.464 --> 00:31:45.512
layers of intertwining clockwork, sliding
hemispheres, rotating bands, and strange

00:31:45.512 --> 00:31:57.035
inscriptions. It's this massive, complicated mess
of contraption, puzzle, sliding pieces.

00:31:57.035 --> 00:31:58.743
LAURA: Does it seem magical?

00:31:58.743 --> 00:32:00.692
MATT: Make an arcana check.

00:32:00.692 --> 00:32:06.706
LAURA: Whoa. That's cocked. Ooh.

00:32:06.706 --> 00:32:07.493
SAM: Amazing roll.

00:32:07.493 --> 00:32:08.672
LAURA: 19.

00:32:08.672 --> 00:32:18.137
MATT: 19. While she holds it out to you, parts
that she's not touching are shifting slightly to

00:32:18.137 --> 00:32:22.995
where it has a clockwork feel. But then you don't
see any gears in the parts that are shifting.

00:32:22.995 --> 00:32:28.589
They're sliding naturally, with a very faint whir.
You can tell there's probably some magic involved,

00:32:28.589 --> 00:32:30.963
but it's a combination of clockwork and magic.

00:32:30.963 --> 00:32:38.762
SAM: It's just that we're surrounded by gunpowder
down here, so maybe not right now.

00:32:38.762 --> 00:32:41.365
DEBORAH: I've been playing with it for weeks.
Don't worry.

00:32:41.365 --> 00:32:43.907
LAURA: Have you solved it? Is it a puzzle?

00:32:43.907 --> 00:32:48.529
DEBORAH: No, but it can do this. Can I do the
thing?

00:32:48.529 --> 00:32:49.366
MATT: You may.

00:32:49.366 --> 00:32:52.764
DEBORAH: I put my hand on one side, and I pull
back one ring. As it pulls around across, at the

00:32:52.764 --> 00:32:56.406
same time, I click another one to the side. It
slides around the side and--

00:32:56.406 --> 00:33:04.070
MATT: As the last part clicks into place, there's
a (whir, puff), a burst of light. About 15 gold

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:06.825
coins go (clanging) to the ground in front.

00:33:06.825 --> 00:33:08.888
TALIESIN: That's how you get a Pinhead, man.
Nope.

00:33:08.888 --> 00:33:13.519
(laughter)

00:33:13.519 --> 00:33:17.809
LAURA: Wow, we have gold coins. Is it real gold
coins? Is it fake gold coins like you and Caleb did?

00:33:17.822 --> 00:33:19.269
MATT: You crack a tooth.

00:33:19.269 --> 00:33:22.445
SAM: Didn't need that one. It's real!

00:33:22.445 --> 00:33:28.177
LAURA: Wow, that's the coolest thing ever. We just
have this lame old dodecahedron.

00:33:28.177 --> 00:33:29.466
SAM: Don't show her that.

00:33:29.466 --> 00:33:31.788
DEBORAH: Oh, you've got cool stuff too?

00:33:31.788 --> 00:33:32.551
SAM: We do.

00:33:32.551 --> 00:33:34.316
DEBORAH: I showed you my stuff.

00:33:34.316 --> 00:33:35.721
LAURA: She showed her stuff.

00:33:35.721 --> 00:33:37.971
SAM: I can't argue with that, either.

00:33:37.971 --> 00:33:41.977
MARISHA: Okay, I got-- ah, it's happening.

00:33:41.977 --> 00:33:47.998
LAURA: We have this thing that, if you look really
hard at it, you have a special gift. You should

00:33:47.998 --> 00:33:49.153
look at it.

00:33:49.153 --> 00:33:54.507
MATT: What she reveals, as she pulls out of this
bright pink satchel, this colored leather satchel

00:33:54.507 --> 00:34:00.912
she has, is this dodecahedron shape that has gold
trim around the edges and these handles. It looks

00:34:00.912 --> 00:34:07.203
like a gray quartz, and it has a very faint hum to
it. It seems to glow in a rhythmic, heartbeat

00:34:07.203 --> 00:34:13.688
fashion. It has this very strong presence, and the
air around it has its own subtle vibration.

00:34:13.688 --> 00:34:15.816
LAURA: If you want to look at it, that's cool.

00:34:15.816 --> 00:34:27.639
DEBORAH: Yeah, okay. I lean over it, and my eyes
are huge, twice the size of my head. Not twice the

00:34:27.639 --> 00:34:29.454
size, sorry. They take up half my head.

00:34:29.454 --> 00:34:30.989
TRAVIS: Holy shit!

00:34:30.989 --> 00:34:34.956
DEBORAH: They take up the whole top half of my
face.

00:34:34.956 --> 00:34:36.854
LIAM: That's pretty freaky, too.

00:34:36.854 --> 00:34:43.966
DEBORAH: Like the big-eyes pictures. I'm looking
into it, and my eyes are reflected back off the

00:34:43.966 --> 00:34:49.194
thing. I stare, and I let it wash over me.

00:34:49.194 --> 00:34:56.830
MATT: Which, as you do that, you feel this
gravitational pull, your essence drawn towards it.

00:34:57.185 --> 00:35:06.022
Your peripheral blurs and darkens. Within, you
feel like you're leaning into it. It's no longer

00:35:06.022 --> 00:35:11.745
an object; it's like a pool of water, and you
cross the surface, and it's warm. Past that, in

00:35:11.745 --> 00:35:17.740
the darkness, you see stars, an endless sea of
stars drifting towards you and past you. You look

00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:23.475
ahead, and you can see other little shapes. You
look at them, and they're you. They're little

00:35:23.475 --> 00:35:29.350
ghosted versions of Twiggy. They're all going in
different directions, and some of them fade, and

00:35:29.350 --> 00:35:35.015
some of them are created. Two of them join and
create a new light and go in a separate path. In

00:35:35.015 --> 00:35:42.879
that moment, you see this single, glowing, warm
light that appears and presents itself to you.

00:35:42.879 --> 00:35:46.780
DEBORAH: I totally reach out and touch it.

00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:52.628
MATT: As you reach out and put your hand towards
it, it merges with your hand. The warmth carries

00:35:52.628 --> 00:35:56.312
through your wrist and forearm.

00:35:56.312 --> 00:35:57.634
DEBORAH: I giggle.

00:35:57.634 --> 00:36:03.061
MATT: It gives this warm, interior hug-type
sensation. As you close your eyes to relish in it

00:36:03.061 --> 00:36:06.157
and open them again, you're back on the boat with
them.

00:36:06.157 --> 00:36:08.784
LAURA: When you open your eyes, I've got the
thing, and I'm totally fucking with it.

00:36:08.784 --> 00:36:12.488
(laughter)

00:36:12.488 --> 00:36:14.500
LAURA: It's pretty cool, huh?

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:19.620
SAM: No, we should really have Caleb look at this.
He's much smarter than any of us down here.

00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:21.632
DEBORAH: I take it, and I roll it across the
floor.

00:36:21.632 --> 00:36:26.325
SAM: No! Beau, get it! Get the thing! Get the
ball!

00:36:26.325 --> 00:36:31.296
LAURA: I put the dodecahedron back in the bag.

00:36:31.296 --> 00:36:36.842
MATT: Okay. As a note, you have what's called a
Fragment of Possibility. For the rest of the day,

00:36:36.842 --> 00:36:40.590
anytime you have to make an attack roll, an
ability check, or a saving throw, any roll with a

00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:45.866
d20, essentially, you get to reroll it. You get to
roll an additional d20 and choose which of the two

00:36:45.866 --> 00:36:47.142
to take.

00:36:47.142 --> 00:36:47.945
DEBORAH: Just once?

00:36:47.945 --> 00:36:49.019
MATT: Just once.

00:36:49.019 --> 00:36:50.112
SAM: One luck.

00:36:50.112 --> 00:36:52.108
DEBORAH: After I've rolled it, I can choose?

00:36:52.108 --> 00:36:53.468
MATT: Yeah.

00:36:53.468 --> 00:36:53.732
DEBORAH: Cool!

00:36:53.732 --> 00:37:02.639
MARISHA: Hey, Twiggy. Now that you've looked at
the fragment, you're bonded to us, which means if

00:37:02.639 --> 00:37:05.932
you betray us, we'll know how to find you.

00:37:05.932 --> 00:37:15.230
DEBORAH: Oh, wow. Well, that sounds pretty
serious! So cool with me. I like people. I like

00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:18.585
hanging out with people. I like trusting people.
So that sounds great.

00:37:18.585 --> 00:37:20.376
LAURA: This is awesome.

00:37:20.376 --> 00:37:22.101
SAM: These are all the right answers.

00:37:22.101 --> 00:37:24.429
LAURA: We should go upstairs and show you to
everyone else.

00:37:24.429 --> 00:37:28.632
DEBORAH: I'd love to be shown. I have a dance!

00:37:28.632 --> 00:37:30.480
LAURA: Oh my gosh. I dance behind her.

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:33.631
DEBORAH: I turn around and my skirts goes flying
up and everything.

00:37:33.631 --> 00:37:36.797
LAURA: What is this? This is the best day in the
universe!

00:37:36.797 --> 00:37:39.642
TRAVIS: Does she still have chocolate all over her
face?

00:37:39.642 --> 00:37:44.530
DEBORAH: Oh, totally. As we go up to the next
level, I take you to my box where I've been living

00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:50.239
for the last week. It is filled with apple cores
and chocolate wrappers and stuff.

00:37:50.239 --> 00:37:52.665
MARISHA: Is there--

00:37:52.665 --> 00:37:53.890
SAM: A stench of urine?

00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:54.664
MARISHA: Yes.

00:37:54.664 --> 00:38:02.824
DEBORAH: As you say that I go: Oof. I motion to a
corner in the back, and I was like: I'm surprised

00:38:02.824 --> 00:38:06.841
you guys didn't notice that earlier. It's pretty
bad over there.

00:38:06.841 --> 00:38:11.904
SAM: That's my bad. I'm down here a lot. I thought
it was me.

00:38:11.904 --> 00:38:13.698
TRAVIS: Real perceptive, rogue.

00:38:13.698 --> 00:38:17.379
SAM: Let's go introduce you to the others.

00:38:17.379 --> 00:38:20.403
DEBORAH: Oh, but I'm a little shy. Who am I
meeting?

00:38:20.403 --> 00:38:24.990
LAURA: You're meeting Fjord, and you're meeting
Caleb, and you're meeting Caduceus, and you're

00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:26.133
meeting Yasha.

00:38:26.133 --> 00:38:28.968
SAM: Okay, so they're all big. They're all bigs.

00:38:28.968 --> 00:38:30.044
DEBORAH: I'm little.

00:38:30.044 --> 00:38:33.146
LIAM: Which one of these two is taller?

00:38:33.146 --> 00:38:38.321
MATT: Actually, probably even keel between the two
of you.

00:38:38.321 --> 00:38:40.875
DEBORAH: Nice! We should come up with a dance.

00:38:40.875 --> 00:38:46.200
SAM: Sure, yes. Yes, we can choreograph something.
We've done that before.

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:47.003
DEBORAH: Have you?

00:38:47.003 --> 00:38:50.098
LAURA: Yeah, it's something like this. Then you do
this.

00:38:50.098 --> 00:38:51.594
DEBORAH: You'll have to teach me.

00:38:51.594 --> 00:38:54.382
LAURA: Yeah. It's a lot of wiggling of your hips,
and it looks pretty cool.

00:38:54.382 --> 00:39:03.262
SAM: No, they're all big, so don't be intimidated.
One of them is a big cow man, but he's cool.

00:39:03.262 --> 00:39:05.038
LAURA: He's got pink hair; he's really pretty.

00:39:05.038 --> 00:39:11.101
SAM: There's a stony-faced, harbinger of
death-type lady.

00:39:11.101 --> 00:39:13.486
LAURA: She's got wings that are so magical.

00:39:13.486 --> 00:39:17.292
SAM: She's pretty cool, though. She's cool. She
likes flowers.

00:39:17.292 --> 00:39:22.078
DEBORAH: I like flowers! I dig in the back of my
hair into a rat's nest, and I pull out a really

00:39:22.078 --> 00:39:24.033
old, wilted, dying flower.

00:39:24.033 --> 00:39:26.781
LAURA: See, Yasha will love that because it's dry
like that.

00:39:26.781 --> 00:39:29.824
SAM: I do the same. I also put flowers in my hair
sometimes.

00:39:29.824 --> 00:39:31.145
LAURA: That's really cool.

00:39:31.145 --> 00:39:32.680
DEBORAH: Best friends!

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:34.749
SAM: Well, I mean, I don't want to--

00:39:34.749 --> 00:39:36.693
LAURA: No, it's fine. You guys can be best
friends.

00:39:36.693 --> 00:39:40.722
SAM: No, no! I think she meant all of us. I think
she meant all of us. It's okay. You can be--

00:39:40.722 --> 00:39:44.918
DEBORAH: We put the flowers behind her ears.
They're really old and wilted.

00:39:44.918 --> 00:39:46.552
LAURA: Thanks, you guys.

00:39:46.552 --> 00:39:51.099
MATT: At this point, around the side, Marius
LePual has walked down into the center of the ship

00:39:51.099 --> 00:39:55.992
and is standing there. "Who the fuck is that?"

00:39:55.992 --> 00:39:57.333
LAURA: Our new best friend.

00:39:57.333 --> 00:39:58.172
DEBORAH: Twiggy!

00:39:58.172 --> 00:40:04.186
MARISHA: Marius, please god, save me. Marius,
let's go.

00:40:04.186 --> 00:40:06.853
MATT: "You're all scaring me right now. I'm going
to go lay down."

00:40:06.853 --> 00:40:09.031
DEBORAH: I'll follow them up.

00:40:09.031 --> 00:40:12.940
MATT: Okay, you guys all make you your way back up
to the deck of the Squalleater. As you hear the

00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:19.127
footsteps rising, you look back to hopefully hear
information about how things went down with the

00:40:19.127 --> 00:40:25.091
supposed sound and stowaway. Instead, you see them
arrive with Twiggy.

00:40:25.091 --> 00:40:27.318
DEBORAH: (sings a riff)

00:40:27.318 --> 00:40:29.073
TRAVIS: What is that?

00:40:29.073 --> 00:40:30.004
MARISHA: That's what we found.

00:40:30.004 --> 00:40:33.624
LAURA: (singing) She's so cute. This was
downstairs. She's the cutest ever.

00:40:33.624 --> 00:40:35.275
TRAVIS: Is that mud on her face?

00:40:35.275 --> 00:40:36.530
SAM: That's chocolate.

00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:37.256
TRAVIS: Chocolate.

00:40:37.256 --> 00:40:39.526
DEBORAH: Mm-hmm. You want some?

00:40:39.526 --> 00:40:41.623
MARISHA: This is Twiggy.

00:40:41.623 --> 00:40:42.333
TRAVIS: Twiggy.

00:40:42.333 --> 00:40:44.424
LAURA: This is Captain Tusktooth. He runs the
ship.

00:40:44.424 --> 00:40:46.070
DEBORAH: Oh, wow, thank you so much.

00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:48.677
TRAVIS: You can call me Fjord. That's not
necessary.

00:40:48.677 --> 00:40:50.359
DEBORAH: Captain Fjord!

00:40:50.359 --> 00:40:52.445
TRAVIS: Sure. Captain Fjord works.

00:40:52.445 --> 00:40:54.840
DEBORAH: Fjordy. Fjord and a half.

00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:56.075
TRAVIS: This is Caleb.

00:40:56.075 --> 00:40:58.382
DEBORAH: Fjorda people.

00:40:58.382 --> 00:41:03.238
SAM: Caleb is very smart, and he's good with
magic. He can probably determine what you're

00:41:03.238 --> 00:41:05.626
carrying, what that ball was that Beau has now.

00:41:05.626 --> 00:41:09.782
LIAM: Who-- what-- how-- why are you on the boat?

00:41:09.782 --> 00:41:16.990
DEBORAH: Just hanging out! Going for a trip, you
know? Seeing the world.

00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:18.313
SAM: It seemed legit.

00:41:18.313 --> 00:41:20.452
MARISHA: I call Caduceus over. Caduceus?

00:41:20.452 --> 00:41:22.433
LIAM: That clarifies that, okay.

00:41:22.433 --> 00:41:25.132
MARISHA: We found a Twiggy.

00:41:25.132 --> 00:41:26.795
DEBORAH: Found a Twiggy!

00:41:26.795 --> 00:41:28.155
MARISHA: She was hiding.

00:41:28.155 --> 00:41:31.882
SAM: From bad people. Unspecified, so far.

00:41:31.882 --> 00:41:33.486
MARISHA: She stole this.

00:41:33.486 --> 00:41:35.548
DEBORAH: I was a little bit bad, but just a
little.

00:41:35.548 --> 00:41:37.686
SAM: Oh, you did something to deserve this?

00:41:37.686 --> 00:41:41.279
DEBORAH: No, I took it. That's all.

00:41:41.279 --> 00:41:47.314
TRAVIS: Yasha walks over, and bends over at the
hips, and puts her eyes right in front of Twiggy.

00:41:47.314 --> 00:41:49.308
I like her. She walks away.

00:41:49.308 --> 00:41:54.233
TALIESIN: I've got nothing, man. I don't even
know.

00:41:54.233 --> 00:41:56.825
LAURA: Fjord, can I talk to you for one moment,
please?

00:41:56.825 --> 00:41:57.721
TRAVIS: Sure.

00:41:57.721 --> 00:42:04.613
LAURA: We walk away. Just so you know, I think
she's really cool, and I don't think anything is

00:42:04.613 --> 00:42:07.317
wrong with her. I think she's the best thing in
the universe.

00:42:07.317 --> 00:42:08.288
TRAVIS: Yeah, I can tell.

00:42:08.288 --> 00:42:12.177
LAURA: But in case you're trepidatious, because I
can see on your face that maybe you are a little--

00:42:12.203 --> 00:42:13.385
TRAVIS: That's my emotion.

00:42:13.385 --> 00:42:15.626
LAURA: -- I do have Zone of Truth.

00:42:15.626 --> 00:42:17.552
TRAVIS: Fair enough. How old is she?

00:42:17.552 --> 00:42:21.455
DEBORAH: Twiggy is doing spins, whirling dervish
in the background.

00:42:21.455 --> 00:42:25.376
TALIESIN: How much chocolate have you been eating?
And for how long? Whoa. Oh, wow.

00:42:25.376 --> 00:42:29.704
TRAVIS: Aren't you worried that her parents are
wondering where she is, or her family?

00:42:29.704 --> 00:42:33.986
LAURA: Oh, well, I didn't wonder about that. I
wasn't worried, but I guess I should.

00:42:33.986 --> 00:42:36.767
TRAVIS: We're in the middle of the ocean, Jester.

00:42:36.767 --> 00:42:42.132
LAURA: Okay, but her parents were probably pirates
if she was stowing away. (gasps) Twiggy!

00:42:42.132 --> 00:42:43.113
DEBORAH: Yes?

00:42:43.113 --> 00:42:45.237
LAURA: How long have you been on the ship?

00:42:45.237 --> 00:42:47.109
DEBORAH: This ship? About a week.

00:42:47.109 --> 00:42:48.686
LAURA: About a week.

00:42:48.686 --> 00:42:49.337
MARISHA: This ship?

00:42:49.337 --> 00:42:53.559
DEBORAH: Mm-hmm. Oh, sorry. Yep, took another one
before. I don't know, kind of a habit.

00:42:53.559 --> 00:42:55.482
MARISHA: Where are you from?

00:42:55.482 --> 00:43:01.337
DEBORAH: Far, far away. I'm from far, far away.

00:43:01.337 --> 00:43:03.332
MATT: Port Damali.

00:43:03.332 --> 00:43:04.700
DEBORAH: Port Damali.

00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:06.216
SAM: That's not--

00:43:06.216 --> 00:43:10.119
DEBORAH: It feels far when you're little and
you've been living in a box.

00:43:10.119 --> 00:43:11.562
LAURA: It's pretty far, actually.

00:43:11.562 --> 00:43:13.557
TRAVIS: I'm actually from Port Damali.

00:43:13.557 --> 00:43:15.474
DEBORAH: Well, howdy there, neighbor.

00:43:15.474 --> 00:43:21.893
TRAVIS: Well, howdy there. What a coincidence.
This is so crazy. Are you trying to get anywhere

00:43:21.893 --> 00:43:23.012
in particular?

00:43:23.012 --> 00:43:26.828
DEBORAH: Nope, just was trying to get away from
Port Damali.

00:43:26.828 --> 00:43:28.636
TRAVIS: I understand that.

00:43:28.636 --> 00:43:30.178
LAURA: Are your parents there?

00:43:30.178 --> 00:43:32.079
DEBORAH: Nope, no parents.

00:43:32.079 --> 00:43:34.051
SAM: No parents? You're an orphan?

00:43:34.051 --> 00:43:36.185
DEBORAH: Oh, they died a while ago.

00:43:36.185 --> 00:43:40.163
SAM: So you're an orphan for a while?

00:43:40.163 --> 00:43:40.794
DEBORAH: Yep!

00:43:40.794 --> 00:43:48.518
TALIESIN: How deep are these waters? I'm trying to
figure out how much of this is-- obviously, a lot

00:43:48.518 --> 00:43:49.583
of this is bullshit.

00:43:49.583 --> 00:43:51.142
MATT: Make an insight check.

00:43:51.142 --> 00:43:52.119
TALIESIN: All right.

00:43:52.119 --> 00:43:55.710
SAM: Bullshit? What are you talking about? She's
the greatest person in the world.

00:43:55.710 --> 00:43:56.607
TALIESIN: 22.

00:43:56.607 --> 00:43:59.973
MATT: Is there anything you want to whisper to
him? Feel free to.

00:43:59.973 --> 00:44:02.008
TALIESIN: Yeah, even just general vibe.

00:44:02.008 --> 00:44:04.773
DEBORAH: I've honestly been very honest.

00:44:04.773 --> 00:44:06.139
TALIESIN: All right, everything's been--

00:44:06.139 --> 00:44:07.089
DEBORAH: But--

00:44:07.089 --> 00:44:09.197
TALIESIN: A little omission maybe?

00:44:09.197 --> 00:44:13.337
LIAM: I am halfway through Identify on this
clockwork gizmo.

00:44:13.337 --> 00:44:15.024
MATT: Okay.

00:44:15.024 --> 00:44:21.572
SAM: Oh, she is whispering something.
dndbeyond.com/criticalrole, let them know that you

00:44:21.572 --> 00:44:24.445
came from us. Give them some love.

00:44:24.445 --> 00:44:25.459
TALIESIN: All right.

00:44:25.459 --> 00:44:28.230
TRAVIS: Wow, okay.

00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:32.343
TALIESIN: I honestly think we need to feed you
something that isn't chocolate.

00:44:32.343 --> 00:44:33.247
DEBORAH: Woo!

00:44:33.247 --> 00:44:35.621
MARISHA: You're a gnome, right?

00:44:35.621 --> 00:44:36.632
DEBORAH: Yep.

00:44:36.632 --> 00:44:39.407
MARISHA: Don't gnomes live for a pretty long
time?

00:44:39.407 --> 00:44:40.400
DEBORAH: Yeah.

00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:43.984
MARISHA: So you could actually be fairly old--

00:44:43.984 --> 00:44:45.218
DEBORAH: Who knows!

00:44:45.218 --> 00:44:48.012
MARISHA: -- and look pretty young. You don't know.
You don't know how old you are.

00:44:48.012 --> 00:44:52.789
DEBORAH: As you see me walk through the shadows,
in shadow I could be 60 years old, but when I step

00:44:52.789 --> 00:44:54.757
out into the light it's like, seven!

00:44:54.757 --> 00:44:56.079
TRAVIS: Wow.

00:44:56.079 --> 00:45:01.617
MARISHA: Fascinating. I don't think she's as young
as she seems.

00:45:01.617 --> 00:45:05.576
TRAVIS: Were you by yourself, Twiggy? There's no
one else we have to worry about pissing in the

00:45:05.576 --> 00:45:06.939
corner of the boat, do we?

00:45:06.939 --> 00:45:08.086
DEBORAH: No one that I know of.

00:45:08.086 --> 00:45:09.621
LAURA: Except for Trixie!

00:45:09.621 --> 00:45:10.815
TRAVIS: Who's Trixie?

00:45:10.815 --> 00:45:12.998
DEBORAH: It's okay! Don't worry, they'll like you!
They like me!

00:45:12.998 --> 00:45:14.191
TRAVIS: Who are you talking to?

00:45:14.191 --> 00:45:16.086
SAM: She's got a rodent in her pocket.

00:45:16.086 --> 00:45:16.936
TRAVIS: A rodent?

00:45:16.936 --> 00:45:18.528
DEBORAH: This is Trixie!

00:45:18.528 --> 00:45:23.053
TRAVIS: What the fuck is that? Goddamn chinchilla?
What is it?

00:45:23.053 --> 00:45:25.353
TALIESIN: That's a squirrel. I know that one.

00:45:25.353 --> 00:45:26.438
SAM: It's a squirrel.

00:45:26.438 --> 00:45:27.942
DEBORAH: It's a little squirrel.

00:45:27.942 --> 00:45:30.009
TRAVIS: I don't trust squirrels; they're tree
rats.

00:45:30.009 --> 00:45:31.353
TALIESIN: Squirrels are great.

00:45:31.353 --> 00:45:32.458
LAURA: They're wonderful, Fjord.

00:45:32.458 --> 00:45:34.022
TRAVIS: You just keep it to yourself.

00:45:34.022 --> 00:45:36.485
DEBORAH: That's okay. Trixie likes it in my
pocket.

00:45:36.485 --> 00:45:38.037
MARISHA: He has an octopus.

00:45:38.037 --> 00:45:42.740
SAM: Sometimes a cat, so be careful with your
squirrel around his cat.

00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:44.321
DEBORAH: Trixie's very wily.

00:45:44.321 --> 00:45:49.650
TRAVIS: Jester, can I put you in charge of keeping
an eye on Twiggy? Twiggy, we're going to the

00:45:49.650 --> 00:45:51.314
Bisaft-- what is it?

00:45:51.314 --> 00:45:52.437
MATT: Bisaft Isle.

00:45:52.437 --> 00:45:55.822
TRAVIS: Bisaft Isle. I don't know if you're
familiar with that area. We need some repairs, and

00:45:55.822 --> 00:45:58.818
then hopefully you can find your way from there.

00:45:58.818 --> 00:46:00.432
DEBORAH: Sure. Thanks!

00:46:00.432 --> 00:46:03.458
MATT: So you're concentrating on--?

00:46:03.458 --> 00:46:08.619
LIAM: I was doing a ritual casting of Identify as
soon as the thing was in my hands and not talking

00:46:08.619 --> 00:46:09.565
to anybody.

00:46:09.565 --> 00:46:11.202
MATT: Okay, so continue while you're doing that.

00:46:11.202 --> 00:46:13.397
LAURA: Let's sit down. I'll show you how to draw
the perfect dick.

00:46:13.397 --> 00:46:14.800
DEBORAH: (gasps) Perfect!

00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:17.716
TRAVIS: Caduceus, could you make sure that she
gets some real food?

00:46:17.716 --> 00:46:21.934
TALIESIN: I was just about to go get something
with something that's not chocolate in it. That's

00:46:21.934 --> 00:46:26.846
probably for the best. I'll be back. Oh, boy.

00:46:26.846 --> 00:46:38.297
MATT: Caleb, as you finish the ritual, your vision
crystallizes on the object. As part of the

00:46:38.297 --> 00:46:42.109
Identify, the information that would transition to
you fails.

00:46:42.109 --> 00:46:45.153
SAM: Oh, shit!

00:46:45.153 --> 00:46:52.637
MATT: You've tried to Identify non-magical objects
before, and been like, oh, this isn't magical.

00:46:53.090 --> 00:46:54.178
This blocks you.

00:46:54.178 --> 00:46:55.569
MARISHA: Interesting.

00:46:55.569 --> 00:46:58.638
TRAVIS: Interest intensifies!

00:46:58.638 --> 00:47:03.657
LIAM: What is this thing that you have? What is
this called? Does it have a name?

00:47:03.657 --> 00:47:13.361
DEBORAH: I don't think it was on the card. I call
it my fun ball of tricks.

00:47:15.391 --> 00:47:18.350
SAM: Happy fun ball?

00:47:18.561 --> 00:47:20.293
DEBORAH: Happy fun ball.

00:47:20.293 --> 00:47:22.465
MATT: Do not solve happy fun ball.

00:47:22.465 --> 00:47:24.880
DEBORAH: Must solve happy fun ball.

00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:26.481
LAURA: Where did you get it from?

00:47:26.481 --> 00:47:29.016
LIAM: Yeah, did you make it? Did you get it from
someone else?

00:47:29.016 --> 00:47:33.088
DEBORAH: No, it was sitting somewhere, and I was
like, this is cool!

00:47:33.088 --> 00:47:35.805
LIAM: In a museum, or--?

00:47:35.805 --> 00:47:38.892
DEBORAH: Kind of, yeah. It was on a little
pedestal, and people were looking at it, and it

00:47:38.892 --> 00:47:44.582
had a little card on it. Then I saw this guy, and
I was like, he's a mean man, and I said--

00:47:44.582 --> 00:47:46.733
SAM: Was he the docent or something?

00:47:46.733 --> 00:47:51.816
DEBORAH: No, he wasn't wearing a uniform or
anything.

00:47:51.816 --> 00:47:56.668
SAM: Why did you think he was mean? What gave off
that impression?

00:47:56.668 --> 00:47:58.797
DEBORAH: (whispering) I've seen him before.

00:47:58.797 --> 00:47:59.713
SAM: You know him?

00:47:59.713 --> 00:48:00.408
DEBORAH: Yeah.

00:48:00.408 --> 00:48:01.383
SAM: Oh.

00:48:01.383 --> 00:48:03.206
DEBORAH: He's a rascally man.

00:48:03.206 --> 00:48:04.720
LIAM: What's his name?

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:05.488
DEBORAH: His name?

00:48:05.488 --> 00:48:06.258
LIAM: Yeah.

00:48:06.258 --> 00:48:06.974
DEBORAH: Sir Cadigan.

00:48:06.974 --> 00:48:09.271
LIAM: Sir Cadigan? That's a good name.

00:48:09.271 --> 00:48:10.536
MARISHA: Was this in Port Damali?

00:48:10.536 --> 00:48:12.215
DEBORAH: This was in Port Damali. You are smart.

00:48:12.215 --> 00:48:16.940
LAURA: Do we know of any museums or places with
magical items in Port Damali?

00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:21.394
MATT: Make a history check. Low DC, since you're
relatively local.

00:48:21.394 --> 00:48:24.694
LAURA: Natural 20!

00:48:24.694 --> 00:48:32.114
MATT: There's not so much in the way of museums,
per se, but there are collections. There are

00:48:32.114 --> 00:48:40.942
collectors, and those are usually private and
invite-only through mutual merchants and nobles

00:48:40.942 --> 00:48:48.783
and people of affluent nature. But there are two
auction houses where a lot of these items are sold

00:48:48.783 --> 00:48:59.196
and traded by these collectors. One exists in Port
Damali. It's called the Exalted Collection Auction House.

00:48:59.206 --> 00:49:00.202
SAM: The Exalted Collection.

00:49:00.202 --> 00:49:01.219
LAURA: I don't know how to spell exalted.

00:49:02.129 --> 00:49:04.199
SAM: You can copy off of me.

00:49:04.199 --> 00:49:08.219
LIAM: Well, Twiggy, tell me. This happy fun ball
of yours, what does it do?

00:49:08.219 --> 00:49:10.992
DEBORAH: Well, it makes money, for one.

00:49:10.992 --> 00:49:12.524
LIAM: How much money?

00:49:12.524 --> 00:49:14.564
DEBORAH: Depends where you touch it.

00:49:14.564 --> 00:49:18.987
SAM: She made 15 gold pieces down there out of
nothing.

00:49:18.987 --> 00:49:20.837
LIAM: That's a Frumpkin and a half.

00:49:20.837 --> 00:49:24.727
DEBORAH: This is true. I've heard of these
frumpkins. I'm just kidding; I don't know what

00:49:24.727 --> 00:49:25.340
that is.

00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:29.632
LAURA: That's his cat-octopus. Owl, also owl.

00:49:29.632 --> 00:49:35.524
LIAM: Sometimes a spider and other things as well.
This does other things besides making money? What

00:49:35.524 --> 00:49:37.128
else does this do?

00:49:37.128 --> 00:49:41.387
DEBORAH: I've played with it a lot, and all kinds
of little flashes and things go off.

00:49:41.387 --> 00:49:43.056
LIAM: Okay.

00:49:43.056 --> 00:49:48.066
TALIESIN: I'm coming up with a veggie plate, by
the way, the sort of things you're embarrassed

00:49:48.066 --> 00:49:50.327
your parents bring up, and putting it down.

00:49:50.327 --> 00:49:52.817
DEBORAH: Twiggy goes: Yum! And digs right in.

00:49:52.817 --> 00:50:01.647
TALIESIN: Do you have any future plans here? Is
there something that you're moving towards? Do you

00:50:01.647 --> 00:50:04.879
have a place that you're heading, a goal,
anything?

00:50:04.879 --> 00:50:07.343
DEBORAH: I like making friends.

00:50:07.343 --> 00:50:08.620
TALIESIN: That's great.

00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:15.288
DEBORAH: I go around looking for friends. I give
my most winningest smile.

00:50:15.288 --> 00:50:17.947
TRAVIS: That is heavily disarming.

00:50:17.947 --> 00:50:25.456
TALIESIN: You're doing great, then. But there's a
direction, a cardinal direction that you're making

00:50:25.456 --> 00:50:27.103
these friends in, or do you--?

00:50:27.103 --> 00:50:29.896
DEBORAH: Things just sort of happen to me.

00:50:29.896 --> 00:50:30.920
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:36.474
DEBORAH: Sometimes I do things, and then I end up
somewhere. I go where the wind blows.

00:50:36.474 --> 00:50:37.266
LIAM: 21.

00:50:37.266 --> 00:50:44.994
MATT: As you're inspecting this, there are
sections of it, Rubik's Cube-esque, where you have

00:50:44.994 --> 00:50:51.608
to rotate an area to allow another part to rotate,
and there's a strange order to these. One, for

00:50:51.608 --> 00:50:57.557
things that should be rotating freely, there's a
consistent resistance to it. You also notice,

00:50:57.557 --> 00:51:03.870
between the seams where all of these pieces of
metal overlap, where there's a slight gap, if you

00:51:03.870 --> 00:51:09.816
manage to hold it in shadow or put shadow over it,
there's a very faint blue-green glow that barely

00:51:09.816 --> 00:51:19.473
peeks through each seam from the inside of this
sphere. There definitely is magic. You're a smart

00:51:19.473 --> 00:51:28.258
guy. You're starting to look it over. You're like,
some of these patterns, maybe could figure it out.

00:51:28.258 --> 00:51:34.120
You do notice that a lot of the strange
inscriptions on it appear to be complicated

00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:42.922
variations of basic conjuration glyphs. None that
you've seen, but you can see the similar shapes,

00:51:42.922 --> 00:51:46.944
the similar equation-type connection between these
glyphs.

00:51:46.944 --> 00:51:48.743
LIAM: That would explain the money, yeah?

00:51:48.743 --> 00:51:53.646
MATT: There is a strong conjuration element all
across, and very minute, impossibly small

00:51:53.646 --> 00:51:55.953
engraving across the metal.

00:51:55.953 --> 00:52:00.399
LIAM: Can I tell how old this thing looks?

00:52:00.399 --> 00:52:08.357
MATT: No idea. All the metal's pretty well kept.
It's pretty polished. There's a couple of errant

00:52:08.357 --> 00:52:16.260
smears of chocolate caught in some aspects of it,
a few sticky fingerprints in some areas.

00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:20.897
TRAVIS: It's like the worst controller you've ever
picked up at your friend's house. You're like, oh.

00:52:20.897 --> 00:52:24.997
Chocolate and Cheetos and all sorts of shit.

00:52:24.997 --> 00:52:29.501
LIAM: Cheeto dust sprinkles out.

00:52:29.501 --> 00:52:33.827
LAURA: Maybe it's like a piggy bank or something.
Maybe it holds a certain amount of coins, and you

00:52:33.827 --> 00:52:36.544
have to turn it the right way. Can you hear coins?

00:52:36.544 --> 00:52:37.868
LIAM: No, I don't hear anything.

00:52:37.868 --> 00:52:40.873
LAURA: Maybe they're really jammed in there good.
Maybe it's because there are so many, they don't

00:52:40.873 --> 00:52:41.664
shake around.

00:52:41.664 --> 00:52:44.516
LIAM: Is it limitless? Does it make money all day
long?

00:52:44.516 --> 00:52:48.175
DEBORAH: Yeah, every time I twist it in that one
way, it'll make money drop.

00:52:48.175 --> 00:52:50.140
LIAM: Can you show me the one way?

00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:53.721
LAURA: How much money do you have down in the box?
Because that's a lot of times!

00:52:53.721 --> 00:52:54.651
DEBORAH: Who needs money?

00:52:54.651 --> 00:52:58.280
LIAM: Excuse me, one moment. Twiggy?

00:52:58.280 --> 00:52:58.984
DEBORAH: Yes?

00:52:58.984 --> 00:53:01.182
LIAM: Would you show me how you make money with
it?

00:53:01.182 --> 00:53:06.031
DEBORAH: I take it back, and I sit down, and I
cross my knees. I put it in my lap, and it's like

00:53:06.032 --> 00:53:09.874
this giant beach ball. I do this same movement
where I pull it from the top around so that it

00:53:09.874 --> 00:53:13.827
opens up, and then I can use my thumb. You see my
fingers are actually long and slender and

00:53:13.827 --> 00:53:19.434
perfectly suited for this. It pushes around the
other side, doing the same movement I did before.

00:53:19.434 --> 00:53:25.224
MATT: This time, (puff), you see this flash of
white light, and eight gold coins clank to the

00:53:25.224 --> 00:53:26.333
surface of the ship.

00:53:26.333 --> 00:53:28.015
TALIESIN: Oh, would you look at that.

00:53:28.015 --> 00:53:29.388
LIAM: May I see that one more time?

00:53:29.388 --> 00:53:31.591
DEBORAH: I roll it across the floor to him.
Catch!

00:53:32.288 --> 00:53:35.132
LIAM: From perfect memory, I duplicate what she
just did.

00:53:35.132 --> 00:53:39.991
MATT: Okay, (puff), white flash. Four gold coins.

00:53:39.991 --> 00:53:41.807
LAURA: Oh, it's half every time.

00:53:41.807 --> 00:53:44.151
LIAM: Well, I take them.

00:53:44.151 --> 00:53:46.232
TRAVIS: 15, eight, four.

00:53:46.232 --> 00:53:48.232
DEBORAH: I pick up the eight, and I say: You want
those?

00:53:48.232 --> 00:53:50.034
LAURA: Oh, Nott already took them.

00:53:50.034 --> 00:53:52.481
DEBORAH: The eight that came out when I did it the
first time.

00:53:52.481 --> 00:53:54.230
MATT: Yeah, Nott already took them.

00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:58.825
DEBORAH: Oh, you already did. Okay, so never mind.
I missed it.

00:53:58.825 --> 00:54:02.242
TALIESIN: You mind if I take a look at that really
quick?

00:54:02.242 --> 00:54:04.759
LIAM: Yeah. I walk it over to him. Here you go.

00:54:04.759 --> 00:54:06.389
TALIESIN: You can roll it. It's all right.

00:54:06.389 --> 00:54:09.336
LIAM: No, I don't think that's a good idea.

00:54:09.336 --> 00:54:12.246
TALIESIN: I'm going to try to move some stuff and
see what happens.

00:54:12.246 --> 00:54:14.626
MATT: Roll an investigation check.

00:54:14.626 --> 00:54:21.505
TALIESIN: Oh, man. Awesome. Oh, no, damn, it was
almost a natural one. I'm so sad. That's a six.

00:54:21.505 --> 00:54:33.997
MATT: Okay. You find one section that shifts,
following suit with her, and it sticks. Yeah,

00:54:33.997 --> 00:54:35.351
you're not getting anywhere.

00:54:35.351 --> 00:54:36.516
DEBORAH: It's hard.

00:54:36.516 --> 00:54:41.043
TALIESIN: Huh. That's really cool, though. I
imagine doing that all day. That'd be great. Yeah,

00:54:41.043 --> 00:54:43.613
I can imagine doing that all day.

00:54:43.613 --> 00:54:47.336
DEBORAH: Welcome to my world.

00:54:47.336 --> 00:54:52.036
TALIESIN: Wow. Rolls really well, too. I'm sorry,
I don't actually even remember why I asked for it.

00:54:52.036 --> 00:54:54.584
DEBORAH: I pick it up and do that basketball
thing.

00:54:54.584 --> 00:54:56.692
TALIESIN: Oh, that's fancy.

00:54:56.692 --> 00:55:01.365
LIAM: What are we going to do with this little kid
and/or old lady?

00:55:01.365 --> 00:55:07.276
TRAVIS: Well, I think we'll take her to the island
and then, obviously, give her a chance to continue

00:55:07.276 --> 00:55:09.448
her adventure.

00:55:09.448 --> 00:55:12.000
LAURA: She can stay with us forever.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:20.714
TRAVIS: Well, now, Jester, look, I loved Kiri as
much as the next person. So much, just, mm.

00:55:20.714 --> 00:55:22.436
LAURA: Yeah, Kiri's wonderful.

00:55:22.436 --> 00:55:27.550
TRAVIS: Yeah, so great. But I also don't want to
be responsible for anyone that can't take care of themselves.

00:55:27.550 --> 00:55:31.207
LAURA: You can take care of yourself. She made a
hand. Can you do cool things?

00:55:31.207 --> 00:55:32.942
TRAVIS: She made a what?

00:55:32.942 --> 00:55:35.576
MARISHA: Yeah, it was super freaky, actually.

00:55:35.576 --> 00:55:39.302
TRAVIS: Are we forgetting to describe things that
are of import on this ship? She did what?

00:55:39.302 --> 00:55:40.927
SAM: She has a bit of magic.

00:55:40.927 --> 00:55:48.163
DEBORAH: At this point, I walk up to you and I
say-- oh, no, I walk up to you. I say: How many

00:55:48.163 --> 00:55:50.707
tickles does it take to make an octopus laugh?

00:55:50.707 --> 00:55:53.555
LIAM: Oh no, don't you dare.

00:55:53.555 --> 00:55:57.313
DEBORAH: Ten tickles! And I cast Hideous Laughter.

00:55:57.313 --> 00:56:00.260
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw.

00:56:00.260 --> 00:56:05.486
LIAM: It's an 18.

00:56:05.486 --> 00:56:08.354
DEBORAH: So it doesn't work, but I go: Funny, huh?

00:56:08.354 --> 00:56:10.462
LIAM: Yeah, I'm not a happy guy.

00:56:10.462 --> 00:56:14.994
TRAVIS: I wanted to see a Caleb laugh so bad.

00:56:14.994 --> 00:56:16.766
MATT: I know!

00:56:16.766 --> 00:56:19.351
TRAVIS: Oh my god! Like some horrible crash.

00:56:19.351 --> 00:56:21.930
DEBORAH: It's an octopus joke!

00:56:21.930 --> 00:56:26.376
LIAM: (awkward, forced laughter)

00:56:26.376 --> 00:56:29.634
TRAVIS: Okay, so she's not entirely invalid.

00:56:29.634 --> 00:56:32.598
LAURA: Fjord, what are you doing?

00:56:32.598 --> 00:56:33.565
TRAVIS: What?

00:56:33.565 --> 00:56:37.525
SAM: He's assessing his new crew. This is what a
professional captain does.

00:56:37.525 --> 00:56:42.676
TRAVIS: That's right. Jester, you would not want
guilt over bringing in sweet Twiggy here to what

00:56:42.676 --> 00:56:46.496
could be certain doom. That's what we do; we seek
out certain doom.

00:56:46.496 --> 00:56:46.746
DEBORAH: Sounds fun!

00:56:46.746 --> 00:56:49.299
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:56:49.299 --> 00:56:53.931
SAM: Just to allay some of our fears, were people
actively pursuing you and chasing you when you got

00:56:53.931 --> 00:56:58.256
onto this boat? And if so, how many?

00:56:58.256 --> 00:56:59.800
TRAVIS: Tell the truth, now.

00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:03.712
DEBORAH: Oh, I always tell the truth. Mom and Dad
said, very important to always tell the truth.

00:57:03.712 --> 00:57:05.046
SAM: May they rest in peace.

00:57:05.046 --> 00:57:14.491
DEBORAH: Thank you. To be perfectly honest, yes.
There were quite a few people chasing me. But I'm

00:57:14.491 --> 00:57:18.407
super fast. Not really, I'm just really sneaky.

00:57:18.407 --> 00:57:22.854
SAM: Do you think they might still be chasing or
tracking you or wanting to find you?

00:57:22.854 --> 00:57:25.151
DEBORAH: Hadn't really thought about it.

00:57:25.151 --> 00:57:26.917
SAM: Ooh. That's not great.

00:57:26.917 --> 00:57:32.118
TRAVIS: Well, you said you got that nice little
sphere there; anything else we should know about, maybe?

00:57:32.118 --> 00:57:33.799
DEBORAH: Fun ball of tricks!

00:57:33.799 --> 00:57:40.815
TRAVIS: Fun ball of tricks, yes. I will not forget
again. Anything else we should know about that

00:57:40.815 --> 00:57:43.502
people might wish they had instead of you?

00:57:43.502 --> 00:57:50.695
DEBORAH: That's all I've got right now, but I do
have sticky fingers. I hold them up, and they're

00:57:50.695 --> 00:57:51.893
covered in chocolate.

00:57:51.893 --> 00:57:54.407
MATT: Who's got the sphere?

00:57:54.407 --> 00:57:57.233
TRAVIS: Caduceus had it last.

00:57:57.233 --> 00:57:59.463
DEBORAH: He's had it. We've been playing, and I
twirled--

00:57:59.463 --> 00:58:01.304
TALIESIN: There was a twirl, and it went back.

00:58:01.304 --> 00:58:05.323
LIAM: Do you have any prospects? Any long-term
plans, goals? Where do you see yourself in a year,

00:58:05.323 --> 00:58:07.189
let alone a week from now?

00:58:07.189 --> 00:58:09.555
DEBORAH: Hanging out with you guys!

00:58:09.555 --> 00:58:13.259
LAURA: Yes! Best answer ever!

00:58:13.259 --> 00:58:14.150
TRAVIS: Oh, great.

00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:15.591
LIAM: What about Kiri?

00:58:15.591 --> 00:58:17.243
LAURA: What about Kiri?

00:58:17.243 --> 00:58:19.205
LIAM: What about Nott?

00:58:19.205 --> 00:58:23.805
LAURA: What about Nott? We're all friends. What
about Cali? We all love each other so much.

00:58:23.805 --> 00:58:26.933
MARISHA: I'm a little confused at your implication
as well.

00:58:26.933 --> 00:58:30.245
TALIESIN: I'm going to Detect Magic to get a--

00:58:30.245 --> 00:58:31.033
DEBORAH: On me?

00:58:31.033 --> 00:58:31.769
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:58:31.769 --> 00:58:33.791
DEBORAH: Detect Magic!

00:58:33.791 --> 00:58:37.153
MATT: There is a powerful magical essence
emanating from that sphere.

00:58:37.153 --> 00:58:42.143
TALIESIN: Okay. No one's got anything sitting on
her?

00:58:42.143 --> 00:58:49.923
MATT: A different kind of magic, but comparable to
the dodecahedron in some ways.

00:58:49.923 --> 00:58:53.914
TALIESIN: Okay. Same vibe.

00:58:53.914 --> 00:59:00.112
MATT: Yeah, and there is two faint magical auras
on her person.

00:59:00.112 --> 00:59:06.254
SAM: (whispering) She's holding!

00:59:06.254 --> 00:59:09.026
DEBORAH: Would he know? Could he be able to tell?

00:59:09.026 --> 00:59:13.574
MATT: He would be able to tell if there was
something magical on your person. He wouldn't know

00:59:13.574 --> 00:59:16.500
any more than that.

00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:18.109
SAM: Caleb would know.

00:59:18.109 --> 00:59:22.252
TRAVIS: Jester, I'm going to leave you in charge
of Twiggy, all right? We've got to make for this

00:59:22.252 --> 00:59:27.270
island. You keep an eye on her. I don't want to
see any chocolate thumbprints in my quarters, you

00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:29.280
understand, Twiggy?

00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:30.358
DEBORAH: Done.

00:59:30.358 --> 00:59:31.590
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:59:31.590 --> 00:59:34.424
TALIESIN: Those were all over it, then.

00:59:34.424 --> 00:59:38.482
TRAVIS: All right, you're in charge.

00:59:38.482 --> 00:59:40.685
LAURA: Hey, don't steal from us, okay?

00:59:40.685 --> 00:59:41.580
DEBORAH: Nope!

00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:44.199
LAURA: Good. See, we're good!

00:59:44.199 --> 00:59:48.830
MARISHA: As Fjord gets the boat going, I follow
after Fjord.

00:59:48.830 --> 00:59:54.464
SAM: I'm going to, seeing as how she said there
are folks chasing her, as we get going again, go

00:59:54.464 --> 00:59:59.392
up to the crow's nest, and do a scan with my
awesome perception, and see if there's any boats

00:59:59.392 --> 01:00:01.155
trailing us.

01:00:01.155 --> 01:00:04.906
MATT: Make a perception check as you clamber up to
the top of the crow's nest and glance over the horizon.

01:00:04.906 --> 01:00:05.813
SAM: 11.

01:00:05.813 --> 01:00:11.214
MATT: Looking off in the horizon, you currently
don't see any ships that are immediately pushing

01:00:11.482 --> 01:00:15.356
into the territory. You're following Fjord.

01:00:15.356 --> 01:00:22.492
MARISHA: Do you need help getting the boat-- ship
sailing? Ship moving? Whatever.

01:00:22.492 --> 01:00:25.374
TRAVIS: Yeah, of course. Feel free to lend a
hand.

01:00:25.374 --> 01:00:31.584
MARISHA: Am I the only one that's not beguiled by
her charms? Twiggy?

01:00:31.584 --> 01:00:34.349
TRAVIS: No, you're not the only one. I don't trust
that shit.

01:00:34.349 --> 01:00:36.804
MARISHA: Me neither. Anything that cute--

01:00:36.804 --> 01:00:40.301
TRAVIS: That saccharine? Yeah, you need some salt
to balance that shit out.

01:00:40.301 --> 01:00:43.989
MARISHA: Have you ever noticed that pomeranians
are the nastiest dogs you've ever met?

01:00:43.989 --> 01:00:45.249
TRAVIS: What's a pomeranian?

01:00:45.249 --> 01:00:49.598
MARISHA: They're poofy. They're super adorable.
They'll eat your face.

01:00:49.598 --> 01:00:54.105
SAM: I run over to them and say: Oh, Twiggy just
did this thing with her tongue where she made it

01:00:54.105 --> 01:00:57.677
into a circle. It was really great; you've got to
see it later!

01:00:57.677 --> 01:01:01.391
DEBORAH: Not everyone can do it!

01:01:01.391 --> 01:01:04.756
SAM: It's really cool.

01:01:04.756 --> 01:01:06.852
TRAVIS: Maybe we throw her overboard.

01:01:06.852 --> 01:01:12.937
MARISHA: That's a solid option. Like a Plan D.

01:01:12.937 --> 01:01:16.598
TRAVIS: When you were down there with her, did she
try any shady shit?

01:01:16.598 --> 01:01:21.811
MARISHA: She definitely has some magic
capabilities. She cast this illusion that made her

01:01:21.811 --> 01:01:27.934
hand look like it was extending. I think it was
supposed to be cute, but you know that uncanny

01:01:27.934 --> 01:01:31.502
valley? It was a little weird. It's unsettling.

01:01:31.502 --> 01:01:33.840
TRAVIS: Right. Okay.

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:36.478
MARISHA: Hey, I have another question.

01:01:36.478 --> 01:01:37.232
TRAVIS: Yes?

01:01:37.232 --> 01:01:41.725
MARISHA: Since you're captain now, right? You're
captain?

01:01:41.725 --> 01:01:43.038
TRAVIS: Apparently.

01:01:43.038 --> 01:01:45.156
MARISHA: Will you train me to be your first mate?

01:01:48.396 --> 01:01:50.403
TRAVIS: Yes. Yes, I will.

01:01:50.828 --> 01:01:52.112
MARISHA: Really? Okay.

01:01:52.112 --> 01:01:57.076
TRAVIS: Are you up for it? Lot of responsibility.
You've got to, like, co-sign for the boat and shit.

01:01:57.076 --> 01:01:59.601
MARISHA: Yeah, okay.

01:01:59.601 --> 01:02:01.822
TRAVIS: Shake on it?

01:02:01.822 --> 01:02:03.084
MARISHA: Deal.

01:02:03.084 --> 01:02:04.765
TRAVIS: All right, first mate.

01:02:04.765 --> 01:02:08.240
MATT: It stings you a little bit. Your wound's
still fresh.

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:10.912
TRAVIS: Ah! Fucking Cobalt grip.

01:02:10.912 --> 01:02:15.418
MARISHA: Sorry again for being a dick. I think
I've been a little bit on edge with the boat.

01:02:15.418 --> 01:02:17.791
TRAVIS: It's all right, I'm kind of immune now. I
just take it.

01:02:17.791 --> 01:02:23.190
MARISHA: It's really just a knee-jerk, it would've
happened if it was anybody. You could've been a

01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:25.749
scarecrow, and I would've been like, "Fuck off,
bro!"

01:02:25.749 --> 01:02:27.813
TRAVIS: I feel so special.

01:02:27.813 --> 01:02:30.126
MARISHA: Okay, let's go.

01:02:30.126 --> 01:02:37.971
MATT: You do also know, as you're heading into
legal territory under the Clovis Concord, that you

01:02:37.971 --> 01:02:41.181
have a ship that is known and labelled as the
Squalleater, as damaged as it is.

01:02:41.181 --> 01:02:42.594
LAURA: Oh no!

01:02:42.594 --> 01:02:44.475
SAM: Change the name!

01:02:44.475 --> 01:02:48.910
TRAVIS: (burbling) That's my call. (burbling)
Forward deck.

01:02:48.910 --> 01:02:54.013
SAM: The Squallbeater. The Balleater!

01:02:54.013 --> 01:02:56.553
LAURA: The Balleater!

01:02:56.553 --> 01:03:00.713
TRAVIS: We need to change it to the Balleater as
quickly as possible. Nott, I need you to hang over

01:03:00.713 --> 01:03:02.855
the side of the ship with a paintbrush--

01:03:02.855 --> 01:03:04.955
LIAM: That's going to draw attention to us.

01:03:04.955 --> 01:03:09.594
TRAVIS: -- inches above the water and change the
name of the ship to the Balleater.

01:03:09.594 --> 01:03:13.892
MARISHA: It actually works pretty easily! You just
add a line, and then you paint over that.

01:03:13.892 --> 01:03:15.508
TRAVIS: Can you do it?

01:03:15.508 --> 01:03:23.721
DEBORAH: I say: Don't worry about it! Don't worry!
Again, this hand comes off of my own hand. I flick

01:03:23.721 --> 01:03:28.790
it, and it flies off and it comes and picks up the
paintbrush. I lean over the side, and it goes down

01:03:28.790 --> 01:03:32.559
and starts to change your title for you, without
having to risk his life.

01:03:32.559 --> 01:03:34.877
LAURA: Wow. She can paint, too.

01:03:34.877 --> 01:03:38.535
MATT: Roll a dexterity check for me.

01:03:38.535 --> 01:03:43.064
SAM: I never remember to use it like that.

01:03:43.064 --> 01:03:47.068
MATT: This is dexterity, to see how well you can
paint it while upside down.

01:03:47.068 --> 01:03:48.961
DEBORAH: Natural 20.

01:03:48.961 --> 01:03:51.538
TALIESIN: This is apparently a Mary Poppins
musical act.

01:03:51.538 --> 01:03:59.987
MATT: Apparently! Not only does she manage to
entirely erase the beginning of the word "Squall,"

01:03:59.987 --> 01:04:10.077
but has beautifully calligraphied the B of "Ball"
to where it looks almost like a set of balls, if

01:04:10.077 --> 01:04:17.596
interpreted that way. It has this nice sparkly
border around it now. It's like (singing)

01:04:17.596 --> 01:04:19.928
Balleater! It's almost got jazz hands.

01:04:19.928 --> 01:04:21.579
DEBORAH: Shadowed and decor.

01:04:21.579 --> 01:04:23.371
MARISHA: I agree with Caduceus.

01:04:23.371 --> 01:04:25.182
TALIESIN: Calligraphy's very impressive.

01:04:25.182 --> 01:04:27.128
LIAM: Is this regular paint or the magic paint?

01:04:27.128 --> 01:04:28.428
MATT: This is regular paint.

01:04:28.428 --> 01:04:29.668
LIAM: That's good!

01:04:29.668 --> 01:04:31.947
LAURA: As a side note, I am hiding my magic paint
like whoa.

01:04:31.947 --> 01:04:33.129
MATT: Good to know.

01:04:33.129 --> 01:04:37.790
DEBORAH: It comes back up and it paints a mustache
on me, and I go: Arr!

01:04:37.790 --> 01:04:38.849
TRAVIS: On who?

01:04:38.849 --> 01:04:40.399
DEBORAH: On me!

01:04:40.399 --> 01:04:43.506
TRAVIS: I thought it was on me! I was like,
(yelps).

01:04:43.506 --> 01:04:46.654
SAM: Wow, that was very impressive!

01:04:46.654 --> 01:04:48.804
LAURA: That's really good. That's really, really
good.

01:04:48.804 --> 01:04:51.107
SAM: You've made some allies today with that.

01:04:51.107 --> 01:04:53.002
TRAVIS: You're a temporary pirate now.

01:04:53.002 --> 01:04:56.545
DEBORAH: (gasping) My eyes get even bigger.

01:04:56.545 --> 01:04:59.692
TRAVIS: It's a great honor; don't mess it up. What
were you saying?

01:04:59.692 --> 01:05:01.262
LAURA: We should take the sail down.

01:05:01.262 --> 01:05:03.997
TRAVIS: Yeah, I was going to say we probably took
stock of any colors we have that we can run up

01:05:03.997 --> 01:05:06.216
that aren't associated with the Squalleater.

01:05:06.216 --> 01:05:09.015
MATT: There are no colors on deck that aren't
associated with it. The only colors that are on

01:05:09.015 --> 01:05:13.570
deck were the colors that the ship previously
sailed.

01:05:13.570 --> 01:05:18.411
TRAVIS: We still have some fire damage on the
boat, though? We're going to play that. Our flag

01:05:18.411 --> 01:05:19.519
was burned.

01:05:19.519 --> 01:05:24.275
LAURA: Our flag was burned by pirates.

01:05:24.275 --> 01:05:27.708
SAM: We could paint a new flag with your brush.

01:05:27.708 --> 01:05:31.759
LAURA: Yeah, but that's a really big amount of
paint to use for a flag.

01:05:31.759 --> 01:05:33.902
MATT: Make a history check, Caleb.

01:05:33.902 --> 01:05:36.397
SAM: Okay. Are you ever going to use that paint?

01:05:36.397 --> 01:05:37.689
LAURA: Yes, I am.

01:05:37.689 --> 01:05:38.250
LIAM: 21.

01:05:38.250 --> 01:05:52.341
MATT: You keep thinking on that sphere. You've
read about similar objects, especially the

01:05:52.341 --> 01:06:00.848
conjuration aspect of it, that are used as
focuses, similar to a bag of holding, to maintain

01:06:00.848 --> 01:06:08.502
and contain things for powerful mages. Its
construction makes you feel like it's very old.

01:06:08.502 --> 01:06:13.841
Probably pre-Calamity.

01:06:13.841 --> 01:06:17.692
TRAVIS: Get the fuck out of here. What? That's so
old.

01:06:17.692 --> 01:06:22.134
MATT: Pre-Calamity is 800 years, and there's a
whole era of very powerful magic--

01:06:22.134 --> 01:06:24.204
TRAVIS: Is it only 800? I thought it was 8,000.

01:06:24.204 --> 01:06:27.941
MATT: No, 800 years ago was the Calamity. Or a
little over 800.

01:06:27.941 --> 01:06:38.332
TALIESIN: Caleb, just a second? Just thought you
should know there's a couple interesting magical

01:06:38.332 --> 01:06:46.289
auras on our new friend. I thought it would be
impolite to point it out or to dispel anything. I

01:06:46.289 --> 01:06:52.156
try and respect people's personal intentions, but
if you feel the urge to do a little Identify at

01:06:52.156 --> 01:06:58.379
some point, that may not be a bad idea. I don't
know. Just to make sure that everything that's

01:06:58.379 --> 01:07:02.740
there is meant to be there.

01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:04.571
LIAM: Noted.

01:07:04.571 --> 01:07:11.307
TALIESIN: I'm not getting a bad vibe off of this
one, just a lot of sugar. Being held up for a

01:07:11.307 --> 01:07:16.253
while in a dark, confined space can make people a
little loopy.

01:07:16.253 --> 01:07:23.079
LIAM: I am also worried about traveling around--
Well, I am not a fan of the name Balleater for

01:07:23.079 --> 01:07:24.593
this boat.

01:07:24.593 --> 01:07:29.499
TALIESIN: No, I also agree. I think it draws an
unfortunate amount of attention.

01:07:29.499 --> 01:07:35.604
(laughter)

01:07:35.604 --> 01:07:40.762
LIAM: On a similar note, I feel like our new
miniature friend will also draw attention.

01:07:40.762 --> 01:07:44.714
TALIESIN: That's fair. That's a very fair point.

01:07:44.714 --> 01:07:51.485
LIAM: Maybe I'll have a chat with her, get us on
the same page.

01:07:51.485 --> 01:08:00.644
TALIESIN: I don't know if she's necessarily going
to listen to you. She's a little--

01:08:00.644 --> 01:08:03.650
LIAM: Sometimes people listen to me.

01:08:03.650 --> 01:08:14.121
TALIESIN: That's very true. You do have an air of
authority. You do! Right now, I'm feeling really

01:08:14.121 --> 01:08:18.989
awkward about this whole conversation purely from
your face. Your face has done nothing, and now I'm just--

01:08:18.989 --> 01:08:23.472
LIAM: Well, it takes two to tango. My palms are
sweating at the moment.

01:08:23.472 --> 01:08:28.109
TALIESIN: That weirdly makes me feel better. I'll
disengage straight up, then.

01:08:28.109 --> 01:08:29.991
LIAM: I am going to find our little friend.

01:08:29.991 --> 01:08:32.322
TALIESIN: That's fine. I'm going to go over and
cook something.

01:08:32.322 --> 01:08:35.440
LAURA: Do you want to say we're up in the crow's
nest? Is that a good place to be? Or would you

01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:39.342
like to be somewhere else? I know you've been
below deck for a very long time.

01:08:39.342 --> 01:08:45.879
DEBORAH: I've climbed up on those things, and I'm
swinging back and forth on the ropes and the hooks

01:08:46.206 --> 01:08:50.729
on the main mast, wind in my hair.

01:08:51.390 --> 01:08:55.857
MATT: As this is happening and you're approaching,
Caleb, you see Orly sitting there with his giant

01:08:55.857 --> 01:09:02.768
tortle arms looking up with his craned tortle
neck, and going, "Hmm."

01:09:03.404 --> 01:09:05.492
LIAM: How long has she been doing that for?

01:09:05.492 --> 01:09:07.735
MATT: "Far too long."

01:09:10.232 --> 01:09:15.134
LAURA: I'm in the crow's nest going: Twiggy?
Twiggy, seriously, come back to the crow's nest, though!

01:09:15.134 --> 01:09:17.510
DEBORAH: Five more minutes!

01:09:19.090 --> 01:09:20.466
TRAVIS: Oh no!

01:09:23.569 --> 01:09:30.529
LIAM: <i>Bitte</i>, a moment of your time, just to have
a chat. You can keep swinging, but could you swing

01:09:30.529 --> 01:09:32.652
a little lower?

01:09:32.652 --> 01:09:39.420
DEBORAH: I jump. It's really light and beautiful,
almost like I couldn't fall at all. You see me

01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:45.824
grabbing on the hooks like a little monkey. I fly
down the mast and jump down so I can sit right

01:09:45.824 --> 01:09:47.122
next to you.

01:09:47.122 --> 01:09:49.498
LIAM: All of that movement is making me nervous.

01:09:49.498 --> 01:09:51.061
DEBORAH: Don't be nervous!

01:09:51.061 --> 01:09:53.964
LIAM: Welcome to The Mighty Nein.

01:09:56.107 --> 01:09:59.874
DEBORAH: (counting) That's weird!

01:09:59.874 --> 01:10:03.472
LIAM: It's sort of a running gag, but it's our
name.

01:10:03.472 --> 01:10:05.023
DEBORAH: I love gags!

01:10:05.023 --> 01:10:09.496
LIAM: You know, if you're going to be traveling
with us for a while, I have a few suggestions.

01:10:09.496 --> 01:10:11.449
DEBORAH: Okay.

01:10:11.449 --> 01:10:16.719
LIAM: So three. The first of them is probably when
we get to land, it will be better if you kept a

01:10:16.719 --> 01:10:27.682
low profile because we sometimes cut a rough
swathe wherever we go and I can't guarantee that

01:10:27.682 --> 01:10:36.096
someone is not familiar with us. So I would hate for any danger to, you know-- best not to call attention.

01:10:36.096 --> 01:10:38.702
DEBORAH: No more friends. Don't make any more
friends.

01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:42.105
LIAM: Well, just stick with us for a little while,
and see how that works out.

01:10:42.105 --> 01:10:43.963
DEBORAH: I love that idea.

01:10:43.963 --> 01:10:50.125
LIAM: Okay. The second suggestion is that you
should meet my cat, Frumpkin.

01:10:50.409 --> 01:10:53.895
DEBORAH: I put my hand over Trixie, in my pocket.

01:10:53.895 --> 01:10:55.441
LIAM: What's the matter?

01:10:55.441 --> 01:10:57.570
DEBORAH: Does your cat like squirrels?

01:10:57.570 --> 01:11:02.320
LIAM: Oh, my cat is very well trained and will not
hurt your squirrel. I promise.

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:09.155
DEBORAH: So is Trixie. (as Trixie) Yeah, I'm real
good. (as Twiggy) Sorry. It's me saying it!

01:11:09.155 --> 01:11:13.258
It's not Trixie, it's me saying it. (as Trixie)
I'm crate trained!

01:11:16.839 --> 01:11:24.204
LIAM: I scarcely know what to do with you. We'll
get to the cat in a minute. I will so gladly

01:11:24.204 --> 01:11:29.495
introduce you to my cat because I'm very fond of
him and love for people to meet him. But before we

01:11:29.495 --> 01:11:38.801
do that, the third suggestion is-- and I cast
Suggestion-- I suggest you share any strange or

01:11:38.801 --> 01:11:47.194
unique or arcane objects or things even that are
of threat with me just so I know that we are safe.

01:11:47.194 --> 01:11:49.353
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw.

01:11:50.277 --> 01:11:52.904
DEBORAH: I have advantage on this.

01:11:54.095 --> 01:11:55.651
LIAM: That's rough.

01:11:55.651 --> 01:11:56.754
DEBORAH: 14.

01:11:56.754 --> 01:11:57.824
LIAM: 16.

01:11:57.824 --> 01:11:59.186
MATT: So yeah, it takes effect.

01:11:59.186 --> 01:12:03.890
DEBORAH: No worries. I scramble up to you and I
try to sit in your lap.

01:12:03.890 --> 01:12:06.691
LIAM: Oh, how about you just sit next to me?

01:12:06.691 --> 01:12:12.920
DEBORAH: I lean my head on your shoulder, and I
say: Okay, so I have this little pouch. Out of my

01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:20.077
bag, again there's feathers and fleece and all
this sand and stuff I'm pulling out. I pull out a

01:12:20.077 --> 01:12:24.767
little cube and say: This is my achoo dust.

01:12:24.767 --> 01:12:27.513
LIAM: Oh, put that back in your pocket.

01:12:27.513 --> 01:12:30.951
DEBORAH: It goes back in my pocket, and then I go:
You want to see something cool?

01:12:30.951 --> 01:12:32.454
LIAM: Always.

01:12:32.454 --> 01:12:36.432
DEBORAH: I go and lift up my cloak and put it over
my head. As I do that, another little Twiggy shows

01:12:36.432 --> 01:12:42.710
up right next to me, and when I move she moves. I
go: Look! And we do a little dance for you.

01:12:42.710 --> 01:12:44.858
LIAM: I put one of my hands through their heads.

01:12:44.858 --> 01:12:47.458
DEBORAH: One of them, yes, it's an illusion.

01:12:47.458 --> 01:12:49.275
LIAM: Oh, that's good.

01:12:49.275 --> 01:12:52.229
DEBORAH: Yeah, people have a real hard time
getting me.

01:12:52.229 --> 01:12:54.057
LIAM: Yeah, I'm not going to try to do that.

01:12:54.057 --> 01:12:55.101
DEBORAH: Yay!

01:12:55.101 --> 01:12:56.549
LIAM: Is there anything--

01:12:56.549 --> 01:12:58.549
LAURA: I'm watching from the crow's nest.

01:12:58.549 --> 01:13:01.589
MATT: Every time she goes into that pouch and
opens it up, you can still see taking up a large

01:13:01.589 --> 01:13:09.730
portion of it, massively, like a distended
backpack, is the slightly shifting clockwork of

01:13:09.730 --> 01:13:11.271
that sphere.

01:13:12.414 --> 01:13:15.207
DEBORAH: I take my hood off and go: Neat, huh?

01:13:15.707 --> 01:13:20.704
LIAM: Yeah, the neatest. Do you have anything that
is harmful or is it just those two things

01:13:20.704 --> 01:13:23.223
including your puzzle ball?

01:13:23.223 --> 01:13:26.793
DEBORAH: I say: Well, these can do some damage.

01:13:26.793 --> 01:13:29.046
TRAVIS: Your hands?

01:13:29.795 --> 01:13:32.100
LIAM: Yeah, okay, well--

01:13:32.928 --> 01:13:35.904
MARISHA: These are registered deadly weapons.

01:13:36.368 --> 01:13:38.297
DEBORAH: Don't mess with me!

01:13:38.297 --> 01:13:45.482
LIAM: For what it's worth, I apologize, and here's
my cat. I turn Frumpkin the first night on this

01:13:45.482 --> 01:13:51.269
boat into a cat and use the last of my supplies,
so it's Frumpkin the cat right now. That's Frumpkin.

01:13:51.269 --> 01:13:52.255
DEBORAH: That's Frumpkin.

01:13:52.255 --> 01:13:53.288
LIAM: He is best cat.

01:13:53.288 --> 01:13:54.168
DEBORAH: Can I pet?

01:13:54.168 --> 01:13:55.663
LIAM: Of course. He's already climbing up her
shoulder.

01:13:55.663 --> 01:14:02.599
DEBORAH: I pet him and it's like: Ooh, I love your
cat! Ooh, that tickles!

01:14:02.599 --> 01:14:11.460
LIAM: I tell him to do a blep. So he just does
this--

01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:14.613
DEBORAH: And Twiggy goes-- back.

01:14:14.613 --> 01:14:21.345
LIAM: All right, you're okay. You can hang out
with Frumpkin for an hour.

01:14:21.345 --> 01:14:24.510
(laughter)

01:14:24.510 --> 01:14:31.981
DEBORAH: Goody! I sit on the floor and Frumpkin
and I start booping each other on the nose.

01:14:31.981 --> 01:14:36.844
LIAM: I go and sit like 20 feet away and watch to
make sure everything is on the up and up.

01:14:36.844 --> 01:14:38.607
DEBORAH: And that's eight hours on Suggestion?

01:14:38.607 --> 01:14:39.291
LIAM: Yeah.

01:14:39.291 --> 01:14:40.260
DEBORAH: Okay.

01:14:40.260 --> 01:14:44.826
MATT: Well, until the directed activity is
completed.

01:14:44.826 --> 01:14:48.116
LIAM: Well, if she's shown me everything of arcane
nature.

01:14:48.116 --> 01:14:51.034
DEBORAH: I've shown you all the magic stuff on my
person.

01:14:51.034 --> 01:14:53.340
MATT: Then yeah, so Suggestion has worn off.

01:14:53.340 --> 01:15:01.921
DEBORAH: I go: Pftt, I know that trick. I give you
a high five. Down below.

01:15:01.921 --> 01:15:04.411
(laughter)

01:15:04.411 --> 01:15:06.938
MATT: Most awkward on-ship high five ever.

01:15:06.938 --> 01:15:12.483
LIAM: We're going to force perspective this shit.
(as Gandalf) Hello, Twiggy.

01:15:14.229 --> 01:15:20.416
MATT: As your new compatriot for this journey
seems to have, for the time being, accepted into

01:15:20.416 --> 01:15:23.469
your wings, is there anything else you want to
do?

01:15:23.469 --> 01:15:27.866
TRAVIS: I'll be showing Beau the ropes,
first-manning the ship.

01:15:27.866 --> 01:15:30.039
MATT: All right, so you're getting that situated.

01:15:30.039 --> 01:15:35.111
TALIESIN: I'll be finishing up some stuff in the
kitchen. I'm going to run by Caleb one more time

01:15:35.111 --> 01:15:44.605
to have a chat about what he saw. Just mention,
we've got two magical spheres on board. The one's

01:15:44.605 --> 01:15:46.792
like a clock thing--

01:15:46.792 --> 01:15:47.890
LIAM: Maybe three.

01:15:47.890 --> 01:15:49.324
TALIESIN: Technically three.

01:15:49.324 --> 01:15:51.927
LIAM: One is in Fjord's gooch.

01:15:54.797 --> 01:16:01.601
TALIESIN: I was thinking it's like a clock. Maybe
that means time-- I don't know if time's passing,

01:16:01.601 --> 01:16:02.728
or something.

01:16:02.728 --> 01:16:09.185
LIAM: Oh, I'm very curious about it. I would like
very much to see if she's willing to sell it or

01:16:09.185 --> 01:16:10.959
part with it somehow.

01:16:10.959 --> 01:16:17.107
TALIESIN: Or at least let you take a look at it
for a while or something. Maybe, I don't know. It

01:16:17.107 --> 01:16:20.028
gives me a chill. Not sure.

01:16:20.028 --> 01:16:24.863
LIAM: I was not paying attention. Has anyone said
how long it is until we reach land?

01:16:24.863 --> 01:16:27.565
TALIESIN and LIAM: Three days.

01:16:27.565 --> 01:16:30.261
MATT: From this point, a little over three days.

01:16:30.261 --> 01:16:32.930
LIAM: Maybe she'll lend it to me.

01:16:32.930 --> 01:16:38.840
LAURA: I'm going to teach Twiggy all about The
Traveler. He's pretty cool.

01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:41.115
DEBORAH: Cool.

01:16:41.115 --> 01:16:50.940
MATT: So The Traveler, she explains to you in a
very truncated way, is the being that she worships

01:16:50.940 --> 01:17:00.461
but talks with and taught her a bunch of things
and they've been a friend. Anything else you want--

01:17:00.461 --> 01:17:04.963
LAURA: I feel like he would like you a lot, you
know, because number one, he likes people that can

01:17:04.963 --> 01:17:07.785
be sneaky because it's fun, right? And you can be
sneaky.

01:17:07.785 --> 01:17:08.974
DEBORAH: It's the most fun ever!

01:17:08.974 --> 01:17:14.973
LAURA: Also, he has a cloak, just like you have a
cloak. Really cool. Also, he always kept me

01:17:14.973 --> 01:17:20.575
company. I know you had a lot of time by yourself,
right? So did I, and he always kept me company.

01:17:20.575 --> 01:17:22.226
DEBORAH: Is he like (as Trixie) Trixie?

01:17:22.226 --> 01:17:24.862
LAURA: (as Trixie) He's not quite like Trixie.
He's more like (high-pitched) The Traveler!

01:17:24.862 --> 01:17:25.839
DEBORAH: The Traveler!

01:17:25.839 --> 01:17:26.737
LAURA: And he comes and he's over here!

01:17:26.737 --> 01:17:27.325
DEBORAH: Oh, that's cool!

01:17:27.325 --> 01:17:29.996
LAURA: But you can talk to him. You could try any
time. He's around, you know.

01:17:29.996 --> 01:17:34.545
DEBORAH: Hello, Traveler! I don't hear anything.

01:17:34.545 --> 01:17:44.127
LAURA: Well, hold on! Give him a minute! Traveler,
come on, I'm trying to bring somebody to you right now!

01:17:44.127 --> 01:17:46.974
DEBORAH: I'm trying! Maybe he doesn't like me.

01:17:46.974 --> 01:17:48.413
LAURA: No, he likes you a lot, I can tell.

01:17:48.413 --> 01:17:48.988
DEBORAH: Okay.

01:17:48.988 --> 01:17:53.792
LAURA: Yeah. Don't worry. He'll make himself known
to you.

01:17:53.792 --> 01:17:54.418
DEBORAH: Yay!

01:17:54.418 --> 01:17:57.005
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

01:17:57.005 --> 01:18:06.291
SAM: You had mentioned briefly that some of
Avantika's men and helpers had been armed with

01:18:06.291 --> 01:18:13.611
firearms. If I scout around, is there any ammo
aboard this ship?

01:18:13.611 --> 01:18:15.277
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:18:15.277 --> 01:18:19.376
TRAVIS: Shit, I totally fucking forgot about that.
The first time we got on the boat.

01:18:19.376 --> 01:18:26.112
SAM: 29! Wait. 28.

01:18:27.585 --> 01:18:32.928
MATT: Doing a thorough pass on the crew's
quarters, the remnant of the crew that now is

01:18:32.928 --> 01:18:44.112
arrested or worse on the island of Darktow, yes.
You manage to scavenge up two boxes of firearm ammunition.

01:18:44.112 --> 01:18:46.163
SAM: Any that fit the gun that I have?

01:18:46.163 --> 01:18:47.859
MATT: Yes, actually.

01:18:47.859 --> 01:18:50.669
SAM: I stole a gun a while ago.

01:18:50.669 --> 01:18:52.718
MATT: Yeah, from Hupperdook, I think it was,
right?

01:18:52.718 --> 01:18:53.788
TRAVIS: I don't think we were here.

01:18:53.788 --> 01:18:55.872
SAM: Oh, you might have been--

01:18:55.872 --> 01:18:57.847
LAURA: No, we were around for it.

01:18:57.847 --> 01:19:01.818
MATT: You manage to pull together 22 shots.

01:19:01.818 --> 01:19:04.467
SAM: That fit my piece?

01:19:04.467 --> 01:19:10.020
MATT: That fit yours. There are a few others that
don't quite. They're made for a larger rifle-type,

01:19:10.020 --> 01:19:13.215
but these particular iron balls will fit yours.

01:19:13.215 --> 01:19:14.855
SAM: Like that?

01:19:14.855 --> 01:19:17.290
TRAVIS: No. That's a kill shot.

01:19:17.290 --> 01:19:19.424
SAM: Cool. Thanks.

01:19:19.424 --> 01:19:25.929
MARISHA: Actually, going off of that, because I
meant to do this last episode, did Avantika have

01:19:25.929 --> 01:19:27.927
anything fabulous in her wardrobe?

01:19:27.927 --> 01:19:28.894
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right!

01:19:28.894 --> 01:19:31.165
LAURA: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, we were opening her
closet.

01:19:31.165 --> 01:19:32.223
MARISHA: We were opening it up.

01:19:32.223 --> 01:19:38.969
MATT: Oh yeah. There are plenty of coats, hats,
scarves, all kinds of things. Most of them in a

01:19:38.969 --> 01:19:45.540
similar vein to what you see her wearing. Most of
them are long coats with the sleeves removed, a

01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:52.283
high collar. Big, billowing scarves and cravats
that are varying degrees of well kept. A lot of

01:19:52.283 --> 01:19:57.830
these she's had for a long time and, as such, at
sea, there's weathering. Some of them have grown

01:19:57.830 --> 01:20:01.545
damp and have a little mildew at the very edges
but have been scraped off multiple times, which

01:20:01.545 --> 01:20:04.279
give it a cool look, but maybe a little bit of a
musty smell.

01:20:04.279 --> 01:20:06.232
LAURA: Mending!

01:20:06.232 --> 01:20:13.926
MATT: There's a number of interesting outfits of a
dead woman that you manage to scavenge.

01:20:13.926 --> 01:20:15.914
MARISHA: I take one of her darker overcoats.

01:20:15.914 --> 01:20:22.697
LAURA: The rest of the days I'm going to parade
around the deck in her clothing. Different outfits.

01:20:22.697 --> 01:20:26.171
MARISHA: Jester gives us a fashion show.

01:20:26.171 --> 01:20:29.909
TALIESIN: This is dark. Even for me, this is
dark.

01:20:31.555 --> 01:20:34.234
MATT: Anything else?

01:20:34.234 --> 01:20:37.603
LIAM: This is still the same day, correct?

01:20:37.603 --> 01:20:41.730
MATT: Yeah. We can continue this journey to the
second day if you want to, but it's up to you.

01:20:41.730 --> 01:20:45.118
LIAM: Yeah, hello, your hour is up, I need my cat
back now.

01:20:45.118 --> 01:20:48.202
DEBORAH: (sighs) Give him back.

01:20:48.202 --> 01:20:56.172
LIAM: Okay. Maybe another day, though, you can see
him again. I'm sorry that I used arcane trickery

01:20:56.172 --> 01:21:00.648
on you. May I borrow the Happy Fun Ball for a few
hours, just to play with it?

01:21:00.648 --> 01:21:04.726
DEBORAH: Hmm, okay! I take it out of my box and I
roll it to you.

01:21:04.726 --> 01:21:08.258
MATT: (crashing)

01:21:08.258 --> 01:21:11.974
LIAM: If you want this to poop coins, I don't
think you should do that too much.

01:21:11.974 --> 01:21:14.581
DEBORAH: I don't know, never was a problem
before.

01:21:14.581 --> 01:21:15.791
LIAM: You've had it for a week?

01:21:15.791 --> 01:21:16.677
DEBORAH: Yes.

01:21:16.677 --> 01:21:20.979
LIAM: Oh boy, oh boy, okay. I wander off with it
to study it.

01:21:20.979 --> 01:21:23.656
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:21:23.656 --> 01:21:27.765
DEBORAH: I put my head on his shoulder. What you
doing?

01:21:27.765 --> 01:21:38.855
LIAM: I rolled a 16. Sometimes it takes a while
for my mind to settle on truths, and I'm having a

01:21:38.855 --> 01:21:42.092
hard time thinking about it right-- you know,
maybe I will save this for later.

01:21:42.092 --> 01:21:42.971
MATT: You rolled a 16, you said?

01:21:42.971 --> 01:21:43.675
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

01:21:43.675 --> 01:21:49.953
MATT: As you're saying this absentmindedly, you
find another portion of it that previously was

01:21:49.953 --> 01:21:53.623
locked in place and wouldn't move. You manage to
rotate one band and all of a sudden it comes free

01:21:53.623 --> 01:21:59.393
and turns as well. You start shifting it a bit
and, as you turn, a little cylinder extends a

01:21:59.393 --> 01:22:06.168
little bit, and you press on it and you hear
(poof) There's another burst, but this one has a

01:22:06.168 --> 01:22:16.142
dull blue color to the burst of light. Suddenly
four cut jade pieces of stone appear and hit the ground.

01:22:16.142 --> 01:22:18.858
DEBORAH: Whoa, it never did that before.

01:22:18.858 --> 01:22:23.211
LIAM: Well, you just have to tinker with it a
little bit. Holy cats.

01:22:23.211 --> 01:22:24.650
LAURA: What! This is the best thing ever.

01:22:24.650 --> 01:22:25.553
LIAM: I pick up the jade.

01:22:25.553 --> 01:22:29.469
MATT: Each one's worth about 100 gold, if you want
to mark that down.

01:22:29.469 --> 01:22:32.413
TRAVIS: Oh, shit. Upgrade!

01:22:32.413 --> 01:22:34.720
MARISHA: Are you still learning tattoos from
Orly?

01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:37.109
LAURA: I know, I know, I know, that's exactly
where my mind went!

01:22:37.109 --> 01:22:44.539
LIAM: Are you looking to sell this, by any
chance?

01:22:44.539 --> 01:22:48.535
DEBORAH: I don't like money so much. What else you
got?

01:22:48.535 --> 01:22:50.495
LIAM: So a good trade, you're talking about.

01:22:50.495 --> 01:22:52.795
DEBORAH: That could work.

01:22:52.795 --> 01:22:56.797
LIAM: What about-- I'm going to throw out some
ideas here. I'm going to start spitballing,

01:22:56.797 --> 01:23:06.228
because I'm very curious about this. I love
puzzles. What about some sort of mystical tattoo?

01:23:06.228 --> 01:23:08.469
DEBORAH: What would it do?

01:23:08.469 --> 01:23:09.977
LIAM: Many things.

01:23:09.977 --> 01:23:11.804
DEBORAH: Many things?

01:23:11.804 --> 01:23:19.172
LIAM: I have been listening to my friend, Jester,
speak of them a lot. All the time.

01:23:19.172 --> 01:23:23.280
DEBORAH: I listen to her, too. She's got a lot of
fun stories.

01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:33.446
LIAM: That is true. This one time, she watched an
ant carrying a piece of bread six or seven times

01:23:33.446 --> 01:23:36.398
larger than it up stairs.

01:23:36.398 --> 01:23:38.725
DEBORAH: Oh my goodness. I've never seen anything
like that!

01:23:38.725 --> 01:23:44.916
LIAM: I've never, either, but I take her word for
it because she's on the up and up. Maybe you talk

01:23:44.916 --> 01:23:52.485
to Jester about a mystical tattoo. That's one
thing on the table. You could be an honorary

01:23:52.485 --> 01:23:54.980
member of The Mighty Nein.

01:23:54.980 --> 01:23:59.094
DEBORAH: Oh! Well, that sounds fun. I like
friends.

01:23:59.094 --> 01:24:00.914
LIAM: I do, too.

01:24:00.914 --> 01:24:04.045
DEBORAH: I go up, I put my arms around him and, if
he'll let me, I'll kiss him on the cheek.

01:24:04.045 --> 01:24:06.113
TRAVIS and LAURA: Aww.

01:24:06.113 --> 01:24:07.717
SAM: That's third base.

01:24:07.717 --> 01:24:11.582
(laughter)

01:24:11.582 --> 01:24:13.473
TRAVIS: Instant death.

01:24:13.473 --> 01:24:16.031
DEBORAH: Yes, make a saving throw.

01:24:16.031 --> 01:24:19.783
LIAM: (gasping)

01:24:20.416 --> 01:24:22.469
DEBORAH: I take my sphere.

01:24:22.469 --> 01:24:29.173
(laughter)

01:24:29.173 --> 01:24:32.475
DEBORAH: That's my next character.

01:24:32.475 --> 01:24:34.907
TRAVIS: Kiss of death.

01:24:34.907 --> 01:24:37.804
LIAM: Thank you.

01:24:37.804 --> 01:24:41.606
DEBORAH: Thank you for letting me play with your
cat.

01:24:41.606 --> 01:24:44.609
LIAM: Hey, you get the whole day.

01:24:44.609 --> 01:24:51.032
DEBORAH: I chase after her, we go play, and you
can play with the Fun Ball of Tricks.

01:24:51.032 --> 01:24:54.755
LIAM: <i>Danke sch�n.</i>

01:24:54.755 --> 01:24:57.972
MATT: Roll another investigation check, I guess.

01:24:57.972 --> 01:25:06.174
LIAM: (singing) That was a fun time. Good. I'm
short circuited from the kiss on the cheek. Yeah,

01:25:06.174 --> 01:25:08.667
no, I know, it's not helping! 22.

01:25:08.667 --> 01:25:17.233
MATT: From that place where you had it, you find
one of the other grinding bands-- it felt like

01:25:17.233 --> 01:25:21.666
sandpaper when you tried to move it-- is now
moving smooth, like it has no resistance, so you

01:25:21.666 --> 01:25:27.724
twist that one around and as you do, you hear this
clicking sound. It fits into place. There's

01:25:27.724 --> 01:25:34.707
another piece around that you hear give this very
faint (creaking) sound. You look for it and you

01:25:34.707 --> 01:25:40.553
find it, and there's a little knob. You turn the
knob and as you do, another section opens up on

01:25:40.553 --> 01:25:46.597
one side, and then there's this flash and you look
over on the ground, and in the middle of the wood

01:25:46.597 --> 01:25:50.879
there's a black hole about a foot wide.

01:25:50.879 --> 01:25:53.677
LAURA: Oh, this is definitely Pinhead stuff.

01:25:53.677 --> 01:25:57.404
DEBORAH: Whoa! I pick up the cat and I walk over.

01:25:57.404 --> 01:26:02.466
LIAM: No! Have you ever seen this before?

01:26:02.466 --> 01:26:04.497
DEBORAH: No, this is all new to me.

01:26:04.497 --> 01:26:05.974
LIAM: We don't see through?

01:26:05.974 --> 01:26:07.221
MATT: No, you look and it's just black.

01:26:07.221 --> 01:26:09.789
TRAVIS: It's just black?

01:26:09.789 --> 01:26:11.405
SAM: We can't see the next deck?

01:26:11.405 --> 01:26:12.043
MATT: No.

01:26:12.043 --> 01:26:13.107
SAM: Oh god.

01:26:13.107 --> 01:26:14.092
DEBORAH: We should jump in. Jump in!

01:26:14.092 --> 01:26:15.880
LIAM: No, that is a very bad idea, Twiggy.

01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:19.074
DEBORAH: (as Trixie) I would jump in!

01:26:20.483 --> 01:26:24.143
LIAM: If you want to make that arrangement with
your squirrel, you are perfectly welcome, but my

01:26:24.143 --> 01:26:33.130
cat is not going in that hole. (foomph) For the
moment. Something-- Captain!

01:26:33.130 --> 01:26:35.674
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll come running down. Yeah, what
is it?

01:26:35.674 --> 01:26:38.250
MARISHA: And his first mate.

01:26:39.619 --> 01:26:43.544
TRAVIS: You don't have to announce it when you
show up. Don't yell your superiority. We'll get

01:26:43.544 --> 01:26:45.482
you a shirt or something.

01:26:45.482 --> 01:26:51.685
DEBORAH: I take out five ball bearings and drop
them into the hole. You hear it hit?

01:26:51.685 --> 01:26:55.859
MATT: As you let go, they make no sound. They just
disappear into it.

01:26:55.859 --> 01:26:58.051
LIAM: And it's traveling with the boat?

01:26:58.051 --> 01:27:01.067
LAURA: Am I still seeing from the crow's nest all
of this shit happening?

01:27:01.067 --> 01:27:03.363
MATT: No, you just see Fjord and Beau go down.

01:27:03.363 --> 01:27:06.406
LAURA: What? What's going on?

01:27:06.406 --> 01:27:14.974
LIAM: Is there any lumber? There's no oars. Are
there any rifles left on this boat, or anything long?

01:27:14.974 --> 01:27:15.719
TRAVIS: Rope?

01:27:15.719 --> 01:27:16.990
LIAM: Yeah, rope, is there rope?

01:27:16.990 --> 01:27:17.972
TRAVIS: I got 100 feet of rope.

01:27:17.972 --> 01:27:24.678
LIAM: Let me borrow that. I'm flustered. I start
lowering rope down in, maybe five or six feet.

01:27:24.678 --> 01:27:26.593
MATT: Okay, it gets to about five or six feet.

01:27:26.593 --> 01:27:27.612
LIAM: And I pull it back out.

01:27:27.612 --> 01:27:29.576
MATT: Okay. It's rope.

01:27:29.576 --> 01:27:31.344
LAURA: It's fine?

01:27:31.344 --> 01:27:36.830
LIAM: I don't know that it's fine. There's a hole
to nowhere in the middle of the boat that came out

01:27:36.830 --> 01:27:41.983
of Happy Fun Ball. What do you call this thing?

01:27:41.983 --> 01:27:47.480
LAURA and DEBORAH: Happy Fun Ball of Tricks!

01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:54.941
MARISHA: So it creates things. It creates money,
it creates gems, and it creates holes to--

01:27:54.941 --> 01:27:56.197
TRAVIS: Put your hand in there.

01:27:56.468 --> 01:27:59.133
LIAM: No, I am not going to put my hand in there.

01:27:59.133 --> 01:28:01.289
TRAVIS: I'm reach down and put the tip of my
finger in the hole.

01:28:01.289 --> 01:28:04.229
MATT: Okay. Temperature feels a little colder, but
it goes in.

01:28:04.229 --> 01:28:06.604
TRAVIS: Just feels cool.

01:28:06.604 --> 01:28:09.389
LAURA: Take your finger out. Is it gone now?

01:28:09.389 --> 01:28:12.258
TRAVIS: (yells)

01:28:12.991 --> 01:28:15.281
DEBORAH: Do another one, do another one!

01:28:16.865 --> 01:28:23.223
LIAM: I mean, at the very least we need to put a
plank of wood over this so that nobody falls into it.

01:28:23.223 --> 01:28:24.937
MATT: (foomph) It's gone.

01:28:24.937 --> 01:28:31.487
LAURA: Oh, it only lasts for a little bit. I
wonder where it would have taken us? Was it big

01:28:31.487 --> 01:28:32.759
enough for us to go through?

01:28:32.759 --> 01:28:34.060
TRAVIS: Like a person-sized hole?

01:28:34.060 --> 01:28:37.556
MATT: It was about a foot across, so a smaller
person, maybe, but a lot of you guys it would have

01:28:37.556 --> 01:28:40.165
been a tight squeeze. Not Caduceus at all.

01:28:40.165 --> 01:28:46.856
LIAM: Fjord, First Mate Beauregard, I'm glad
you're here. I want to introduce you to the new

01:28:46.856 --> 01:28:50.353
honorary member of The Mighty Nein.

01:28:50.353 --> 01:28:55.927
TRAVIS: Oh. My goodness. You must have proved
yourself greatly.

01:28:55.927 --> 01:28:57.885
MARISHA: Welcome to The Mighty Nein.

01:28:57.885 --> 01:29:01.209
DEBORAH: Why thank you. We'll be The Mighty Ten!
No? That's not how it works?

01:29:01.209 --> 01:29:06.038
TRAVIS: We vote on the name every couple of
months, but it's going to be a while.

01:29:06.038 --> 01:29:08.181
DEBORAH: Oh.

01:29:08.181 --> 01:29:12.167
TRAVIS: Well, she needs a hat.

01:29:12.167 --> 01:29:15.026
LIAM: Yep. The bigger, the better.

01:29:15.026 --> 01:29:18.511
TRAVIS: Every pirate needs a hat.

01:29:18.511 --> 01:29:20.939
LAURA: Do you want one of Avantika's hats?

01:29:20.939 --> 01:29:22.716
DEBORAH: Are they my size?

01:29:22.716 --> 01:29:24.708
LAURA: It would be really big on you.

01:29:24.708 --> 01:29:29.341
DEBORAH: We put a hat on and it comes down to
here. As I move, it slides across.

01:29:29.341 --> 01:29:35.413
LAURA: I'll tell you what. I will use my pretty
paint to paint her a really cool pirate hat that

01:29:35.413 --> 01:29:41.232
is her size. Okay. It's like this big.

01:29:41.232 --> 01:29:43.396
DEBORAH: And it has the points on it.

01:29:43.396 --> 01:29:47.825
LAURA: Exactly what you want, yes. It has the
tricorn. And do you want feathers and stuff?

01:29:47.825 --> 01:29:49.776
DEBORAH: One big purple feather.

01:29:49.776 --> 01:29:51.860
LAURA: You got it, one big purple feather.

01:29:51.860 --> 01:29:58.514
MATT: She takes this couple of materials out and
this pot of paint. As she paints with it, it

01:29:58.514 --> 01:30:06.108
begins to take shape and become a physical object,
representative of what she drew.

01:30:06.108 --> 01:30:11.195
LAURA: Do you want any sparkly stuff on it, or a
bow? Sometimes bows are really pretty.

01:30:11.195 --> 01:30:15.162
DEBORAH: I have a feather already. Can you put a
little squirrel?

01:30:15.162 --> 01:30:21.676
LAURA: Totally. It will be a squirrel figurine on
this, next to the feather. It'll be really pretty,

01:30:21.676 --> 01:30:25.478
okay. There we go. (poof)

01:30:25.478 --> 01:30:29.011
DEBORAH: (gasps) I take it, and I put it on, and
I'm like: Now I'm a real pirate!

01:30:29.011 --> 01:30:30.809
LAURA: You look like a really good pirate.

01:30:30.809 --> 01:30:31.949
DEBORAH: Thanks!

01:30:31.949 --> 01:30:35.739
LIAM: I will say, what we have learned on all our
travels on the ocean is, the days are long and you

01:30:35.739 --> 01:30:37.497
have to make your own fun.

01:30:37.497 --> 01:30:41.042
DEBORAH: Oh boy, you're telling me.

01:30:42.264 --> 01:30:44.898
MATT: The sphere is still locked in the place
where you had it last, and there's that one little

01:30:44.898 --> 01:30:49.814
knob that's still visible from where it was. It
seems like, with each stage that you've unlocked

01:30:49.814 --> 01:30:52.379
of this, it's opened up another stage.

01:30:52.379 --> 01:30:53.528
LIAM: It's getting more pokey?

01:30:53.528 --> 01:30:54.846
MATT: A little bit.

01:30:54.846 --> 01:30:56.411
LIAM: Less smooth and spherical?

01:30:56.411 --> 01:30:58.539
MATT: Less smooth, and there are more elements
that are starting to protrude a bit.

01:30:58.539 --> 01:31:03.721
LIAM: Does this thing, every day, sort of shrink
back in on itself, or do you ever slide it back

01:31:03.721 --> 01:31:06.972
together? Or has it been getting more complex over
time?

01:31:06.972 --> 01:31:11.304
DEBORAH: I've never gotten it further than that
first stage, so I don't know.

01:31:11.304 --> 01:31:12.387
LIAM: Oh, okay.

01:31:15.377 --> 01:31:17.492
MARISHA: Do it again.

01:31:18.485 --> 01:31:20.148
LIAM: It took me a few minutes to--

01:31:20.148 --> 01:31:21.225
DEBORAH: (as Trixie) Do it again!

01:31:21.225 --> 01:31:22.113
LIAM: Oh, okay.

01:31:22.113 --> 01:31:24.561
MATT: All you have to do is press on that to
trigger it again.

01:31:24.561 --> 01:31:26.561
LIAM: To press-- oh. (clicks)

01:31:26.561 --> 01:31:29.159
MATT: (poof) That hole appears again.

01:31:29.159 --> 01:31:30.127
TRAVIS: Same size?

01:31:30.127 --> 01:31:31.940
MATT: Same size, in a slightly different
location.

01:31:31.940 --> 01:31:32.925
MARISHA: Nott!

01:31:32.925 --> 01:31:34.069
SAM: What?

01:31:34.069 --> 01:31:35.618
MARISHA: Do you want to go in a hole?

01:31:35.618 --> 01:31:38.617
LAURA: (gasps) What if the hole disappears while
Nott is still in it?

01:31:38.617 --> 01:31:40.762
TRAVIS: I'm sure it'll be fine.

01:31:40.762 --> 01:31:47.105
DEBORAH: I'll take out my lantern, and I strike it
so that it's lit. I attach it to a string. I go

01:31:47.105 --> 01:31:50.066
and I start to lower it down the hole and see if
it does anything.

01:31:50.066 --> 01:31:54.459
MATT: As the lantern hits the darkness, the
darkness consumes it like water. Once the lantern

01:31:54.459 --> 01:31:57.878
is submerged within the darkness, no light. You
don't even see the lantern.

01:31:57.878 --> 01:31:59.260
DEBORAH: Then if I pull it up?

01:31:59.260 --> 01:32:00.847
MATT: Still lit.

01:32:00.847 --> 01:32:01.941
LAURA: I feel like we should put our head through
it.

01:32:01.941 --> 01:32:05.445
TRAVIS: I think so, too, but you've got to do it
quick because it's going to stop real quick.

01:32:05.445 --> 01:32:07.602
MARISHA: It's still a foot?

01:32:07.602 --> 01:32:08.400
MATT: Mm-hmm.

01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:10.447
TRAVIS: Do it, do it!

01:32:10.447 --> 01:32:11.978
LAURA: But do it really fast!

01:32:11.978 --> 01:32:13.605
SAM: I'm not doing that, no way! You're crazy!

01:32:13.605 --> 01:32:16.537
MATT: It's gone. It only lasts about a minute.

01:32:16.537 --> 01:32:18.919
LIAM: You could have been decapitated, doing
that.

01:32:18.919 --> 01:32:20.007
SAM: Yes! Thank you.

01:32:20.007 --> 01:32:21.225
MARISHA: Well, he says it lasts a minute.

01:32:21.225 --> 01:32:23.448
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's been about twice, a minute each
time.

01:32:23.448 --> 01:32:25.838
MATT: Each time it's lasted about a minute, yeah.

01:32:25.838 --> 01:32:28.501
MARISHA: When we've timed it!

01:32:29.083 --> 01:32:32.789
MATT: Both times, it's been approximately the same
length of time, close to a minute.

01:32:32.789 --> 01:32:35.696
LIAM: Keen Mind, nah, it's a minute.

01:32:35.696 --> 01:32:39.330
TRAVIS: Jester and Beau, boulder-parchment-shears.
Figure out who's going to put their head in and

01:32:39.330 --> 01:32:40.603
help us see it.

01:32:40.603 --> 01:32:42.406
SAM: Why do we care what's in the-- oh, man.

01:32:42.406 --> 01:32:43.352
LAURA: You have to do it!

01:32:43.352 --> 01:32:44.238
MARISHA: All right, I'll do it.

01:32:44.238 --> 01:32:46.536
LIAM: Are you readied?

01:32:46.536 --> 01:32:47.533
MARISHA: Yeah!

01:32:47.533 --> 01:32:50.446
TRAVIS: I'll grab onto her britches as she's doing
it.

01:32:50.446 --> 01:32:54.153
TALIESIN: I'm finally walking in because everybody
has vanished off the ship, and no one is eating anything.

01:32:54.153 --> 01:32:55.295
DEBORAH: You're missing it!

01:32:55.295 --> 01:32:56.502
MARISHA: Caduceus, grab my feet, just in case.

01:32:56.502 --> 01:32:57.836
TALIESIN: What are we--

01:32:57.836 --> 01:32:59.101
MARISHA: Just grab my feet.

01:32:59.101 --> 01:33:01.784
TALIESIN: Okay, I like grabbing feet. Here we
are.

01:33:01.784 --> 01:33:02.662
LAURA: I'll get ready with Cure Wounds.

01:33:02.662 --> 01:33:04.323
MATT: The hole opens up.

01:33:04.323 --> 01:33:05.594
SAM: It's open! Go!

01:33:05.594 --> 01:33:08.266
MATT: You look inside; it's darkness.

01:33:08.266 --> 01:33:10.057
MARISHA: Drop me further!

01:33:10.057 --> 01:33:11.542
TRAVIS: Down to her feet.

01:33:11.542 --> 01:33:13.384
MATT: Still darkness. You can put your goggles on,
if you want.

01:33:13.384 --> 01:33:14.407
MARISHA: Goggles, yeah!

01:33:14.407 --> 01:33:18.441
MATT: Put goggles on, and your face, as he pushes
you down further, you hit something. It's soft.

01:33:18.441 --> 01:33:21.619
You pull back a bit and look, and there's a pile
of objects there.

01:33:21.619 --> 01:33:22.613
LAURA: Take them!

01:33:22.613 --> 01:33:23.663
MARISHA: I grab a few!

01:33:23.663 --> 01:33:26.169
MATT: Okay. As you pull her out before she slips.

01:33:26.169 --> 01:33:26.997
TALIESIN: Oh, yep, I'm on it.

01:33:26.997 --> 01:33:28.169
MARISHA: Pull me back!

01:33:28.169 --> 01:33:34.945
MATT: As you're pulling back, a few things start
tumbling out of this thing. You grab them and pull

01:33:34.945 --> 01:33:39.351
them in. You pull out, and she emerges. You have
this pile of reddish cloth, and a strange metal

01:33:39.351 --> 01:33:43.639
object of some kind, and a couple other things.
You pull the rest of them out that's dangling in.

01:33:43.639 --> 01:33:47.014
As soon as it does, the hole closes.

01:33:47.014 --> 01:33:49.475
TALIESIN: Wow! That's cool. Do that again.

01:33:49.475 --> 01:33:51.722
LAURA: Oh my god, what if it's a safe in another
dimension?

01:33:51.722 --> 01:33:52.721
LIAM: What did you see? Could you see?

01:33:52.721 --> 01:33:55.967
MATT: You look at it. First off--

01:33:55.967 --> 01:33:57.735
TRAVIS: Do I look the same?

01:33:57.735 --> 01:33:59.901
MARISHA: What is my face?

01:33:59.901 --> 01:34:01.978
MATT: She's pulling her tongue out.

01:34:01.978 --> 01:34:04.812
TRAVIS: Start speaking in Latin.

01:34:04.812 --> 01:34:14.757
MATT: First off, you hear (impacts) as two boots
fall out of this pile of clothes she has, these

01:34:14.757 --> 01:34:24.471
really nice leather boots that are fur on the top.
They hit the ground. There's a metal rod that

01:34:24.471 --> 01:34:33.326
looks like a staff that you hold and pull there.
The other thing is a bundle of this really heavy,

01:34:33.407 --> 01:34:42.421
warm, winter-coat velvet material. It's a deep
crimson-red color with golden trim on it. As you

01:34:42.421 --> 01:34:48.298
unravel it, there's an embroidered symbol across
the back of it. That's the symbol, right there.

01:34:48.298 --> 01:34:51.026
LAURA: Do we recognize it?

01:34:51.026 --> 01:34:55.144
MATT: You do not. You guys have never seen this
before.

01:34:55.144 --> 01:34:56.947
LAURA: That's definitely an H with a bow.

01:34:56.947 --> 01:34:58.485
SAM: Or it could be the tail of a whale or
something.

01:34:58.485 --> 01:34:59.862
LIAM: Beauregard, let me see this.

01:34:59.862 --> 01:35:02.276
MATT: I mean, you're looking at it there. There's
not much more to it than that.

01:35:02.276 --> 01:35:04.000
LIAM: But it's on the coat, yeah?

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.005
TRAVIS: There's a watermark up here. I can see it.
It's amazing!

01:35:06.005 --> 01:35:08.505
MATT: That watermark is part of the paper! It's
not part of the actual symbol.

01:35:08.505 --> 01:35:10.592
TRAVIS: Oh, I don't believe, Matt! I don't believe
it!

01:35:10.592 --> 01:35:12.500
TALIESIN: The fourth wall lies!

01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:16.171
LIAM: It's the coat, it is boots, and the third
thing was--

01:35:16.171 --> 01:35:21.467
MATT: It's a metal staff. You look at it and it's
a metallic staff, about three to four feet long.

01:35:21.467 --> 01:35:25.246
It has a seam in the middle of it, like it's two
pieces joined.

01:35:25.246 --> 01:35:28.271
LAURA: Was there anything else in there?

01:35:28.271 --> 01:35:34.830
MARISHA: It was super dark. I hit a barrier. It
felt like it was a barrier of stuff.

01:35:34.830 --> 01:35:38.540
LAURA: What if this ball is somebody's treasury or
something?

01:35:38.540 --> 01:35:41.666
SAM: Or if it's their pink haversack!

01:35:41.666 --> 01:35:44.249
LAURA: Yeah, that's what I mean! They've been
storing stuff in it.

01:35:44.249 --> 01:35:45.386
LIAM: It's a vault.

01:35:45.386 --> 01:35:46.477
LAURA: (gasps) It's a vault!

01:35:46.477 --> 01:35:48.034
MARISHA: Oh, shit.

01:35:48.034 --> 01:35:50.673
TRAVIS: We've got to figure out what all this
stuff is, first. I mean, just so it's not a pole

01:35:50.673 --> 01:35:52.333
and a pair of shitty boots.

01:35:52.333 --> 01:35:58.102
LIAM: Here, hold this. I give her the doohickus,
and I say: I need 30 minutes. I gather up all this

01:35:58.102 --> 01:35:59.950
stuff, and I walk with it, very happily.

01:35:59.950 --> 01:36:01.214
LAURA: I follow him and sit next to him.

01:36:01.214 --> 01:36:04.458
MATT: We'll say, for the sake of brevity, the
boots are not magical. They're just really warm

01:36:04.458 --> 01:36:07.760
boots. The cloak is not magical; it's just a very
warm cloak.

01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:09.178
TRAVIS: With that symbol on the back.

01:36:09.178 --> 01:36:15.578
MATT: With the symbol on it. The staff is faintly
magical, and what it is is it acts like a hand

01:36:15.578 --> 01:36:20.616
warmer. You take the two parts, and you slide them
together, and it clicks. The metal emanates enough

01:36:20.616 --> 01:36:25.661
heat to warm the hands of whoever's holding it.
This appears to be a set of travel gear for

01:36:25.661 --> 01:36:28.225
whoever once might have had this.

01:36:28.225 --> 01:36:33.589
LIAM: I also use an additional ten minutes to
touch the coat and cast Comprehend Languages on

01:36:33.589 --> 01:36:35.704
this, see if it says anything.

01:36:35.704 --> 01:36:36.869
MATT and LIAM: It's a name.

01:36:36.869 --> 01:36:38.322
MATT: Yep. Halas.

01:36:38.322 --> 01:36:39.371
SAM: What is it?

01:36:39.371 --> 01:36:43.074
MATT: Halas. H-A-L-A-S.

01:36:43.074 --> 01:36:45.743
LIAM: Well, we have just robbed Halas.

01:36:45.743 --> 01:36:47.363
TRAVIS: Have any of us heard that name before?

01:36:47.363 --> 01:36:48.248
MATT: (disagreement) Mm-mm.

01:36:48.248 --> 01:36:54.518
MARISHA: Do we know what language that name hails
from?

01:36:58.143 --> 01:37:06.527
MATT: It seems to have some roots in Zemnian, but
it's a divergent element, so a name that hasn't

01:37:06.527 --> 01:37:11.679
been used in a long, long time. Kind of like--

01:37:11.679 --> 01:37:12.720
TRAVIS: Archibald, or--

01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:20.677
MATT: Yeah, like Melchor. Things that are old
historical names. In fact, roll a history check.

01:37:20.677 --> 01:37:23.996
LIAM: Old magic. Natural one.

01:37:23.996 --> 01:37:28.659
MATT: It slips from you. There's something. You're
like, hmm.

01:37:28.659 --> 01:37:33.708
TRAVIS: Beau, when you hit that buffer, did it
feel hard and solid, or was it soft and earthen?

01:37:33.708 --> 01:37:41.239
MATT: Your face hit the cloak. You were like
(impact) into this pile of soft, heavy material.

01:37:41.239 --> 01:37:43.041
MARISHA: It was cloak and stuff.

01:37:43.041 --> 01:37:45.210
TRAVIS: Did you find a portal into somebody's
wardrobe?

01:37:45.210 --> 01:37:52.231
MARISHA: It was cold in there. I don't know. He's
saying that the staff heats his hands, and there

01:37:52.231 --> 01:37:55.114
was a cloak. Maybe wherever this haversack was
from--

01:37:55.114 --> 01:37:58.214
MATT: A couple of ball bearings fall out of the
cloak from what was dropped in there earlier.

01:37:58.214 --> 01:37:59.402
LAURA: Oh, cool!

01:37:59.402 --> 01:38:01.402
DEBORAH: I collect them back and put them in my
bag.

01:38:01.402 --> 01:38:03.865
TRAVIS: Well, at least it's the same place each
time, so if it does close off, we at least know

01:38:03.865 --> 01:38:05.040
how to find you.

01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:06.850
SAM: Sure. Why are you looking at me when you say
that?

01:38:06.850 --> 01:38:08.043
TRAVIS: You're going in.

01:38:08.043 --> 01:38:09.317
SAM: No, I'm not going in!

01:38:09.317 --> 01:38:11.103
TRAVIS: Yeah, you're really good at finding
stuff.

01:38:11.103 --> 01:38:16.042
DEBORAH: I'll go in! If you don't want to go, I'll
go, or I'll go with you. Want to go together?

01:38:16.042 --> 01:38:19.442
SAM: Into somebody's laundry bag?

01:38:19.442 --> 01:38:20.844
DEBORAH: Why not?

01:38:20.844 --> 01:38:22.140
SAM: All right.

01:38:22.140 --> 01:38:28.904
MARISHA: It feels like someone was raptured, and
we're stealing their stuff. That's what it feels like.

01:38:28.904 --> 01:38:31.537
LIAM: Just roll with it, though.

01:38:31.537 --> 01:38:33.401
SAM: I'll take a big swig and get ready.

01:38:33.401 --> 01:38:36.504
TRAVIS: When she was yelling on the other side of
the portal, was there any sound that came between

01:38:36.504 --> 01:38:38.500
the two? Between the portal? Nothing?

01:38:38.500 --> 01:38:39.500
MATT: Nothing.

01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:45.603
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to tie this rope around
your waist, okay. Then this rope is going to tie

01:38:45.603 --> 01:38:52.219
around your waist, now, so you guys are tied
together. Then we're going to hold it up top.

01:38:52.219 --> 01:38:56.244
Okay, you have a minute. If you start to go
too long, we're going to pull you up.

01:38:56.346 --> 01:38:59.877
TRAVIS: Or if you're ready to come back, tug twice
on the rope.

01:38:59.877 --> 01:39:01.593
DEBORAH: I hold his hand, if he'll let me.

01:39:01.593 --> 01:39:02.602
MATT: Her hand.

01:39:02.602 --> 01:39:04.672
DEBORAH: Her hand, sorry. I hold her hand, if
she'll let me.

01:39:04.672 --> 01:39:08.008
SAM: Of course. I squeeze it way too hard.

01:39:08.008 --> 01:39:09.799
LIAM: Okay, are you ready?

01:39:09.799 --> 01:39:10.766
SAM: Yes.

01:39:10.766 --> 01:39:12.077
LIAM: <i>Eins, zwei, drei</i>, (click).

01:39:12.077 --> 01:39:15.051
SAM: (yelling)

01:39:15.051 --> 01:39:20.849
MATT: One by one, you guys jump in, one after the
other, and you both tumble in and hit a floor.

01:39:20.849 --> 01:39:22.815
DEBORAH: Can we see anything?

01:39:22.815 --> 01:39:27.456
MATT: Looking around, you both have darkvision
because gnomes. It's a cylindrical chamber. It

01:39:27.456 --> 01:39:30.123
feels almost like a natural rock interior.

01:39:30.123 --> 01:39:31.773
DEBORAH: Doors out, anything like that? Any
exits?

01:39:31.773 --> 01:39:33.548
MATT: No. It's just a little pocket.

01:39:33.548 --> 01:39:34.781
DEBORAH: What do we see, what stuff?

01:39:34.781 --> 01:39:38.871
MATT: You see two other ball bearings you left
behind, and that's it. It looks like you've

01:39:38.871 --> 01:39:41.022
cleaned out what was in this pocket.

01:39:41.022 --> 01:39:42.649
SAM and DEBORAH: Tug, tug!

01:39:42.649 --> 01:39:44.575
MATT: You guys emerge.

01:39:44.575 --> 01:39:46.853
DEBORAH: That was so much fun!

01:39:46.853 --> 01:39:50.525
SAM: It was crazy down there. The lights, the
monsters!

01:39:50.525 --> 01:39:51.519
TRAVIS: Really?

01:39:51.519 --> 01:39:53.432
SAM: It was insane!

01:39:53.432 --> 01:39:54.325
TRAVIS: You're so brave!

01:39:54.325 --> 01:39:57.764
SAM: It was a parade of horrors.

01:39:57.764 --> 01:39:58.754
TRAVIS: You're full of shit, aren't you?

01:39:58.754 --> 01:40:01.124
SAM: Yeah, there was nothing down there.

01:40:01.124 --> 01:40:02.091
LAURA: That was it?

01:40:02.091 --> 01:40:05.262
SAM: No, it was nothing. But it's a lot of space,
so if we wanted to store something for

01:40:05.262 --> 01:40:07.476
safekeeping, it's a good spot to do it.

01:40:07.476 --> 01:40:12.130
MATT: The area on the sphere where you've been
pressing this button, you look and it's freed

01:40:12.130 --> 01:40:14.711
another area as well that can continue to be
solved.

01:40:14.711 --> 01:40:16.838
LAURA: Yeah, do it!

01:40:16.838 --> 01:40:21.568
TRAVIS: As a note, the previous function of the
sphere, we can access? Or is it one function at a

01:40:21.568 --> 01:40:23.962
time as it changes?

01:40:23.962 --> 01:40:29.522
MATT: As it looks right now, you need to shift it
back to use a previous function. Each thing you

01:40:29.522 --> 01:40:35.022
slide unlocks the next use, but it closes off the
previous one until you reverse it.

01:40:35.022 --> 01:40:37.399
LIAM: Which I am memorizing.

01:40:37.399 --> 01:40:42.209
MARISHA: I go to Fjord. You've told us about the
Halas thing?

01:40:42.209 --> 01:40:43.705
LIAM: Yeah, sure.

01:40:43.705 --> 01:40:52.725
MARISHA: Is this perhaps something to do with Sir
Cadigan and Port Damali stuff? Do you know a

01:40:52.725 --> 01:40:55.461
Cadigan? Would I recognize the name Hadigas?

01:40:55.461 --> 01:40:56.117
MATT: You wouldn't.

01:40:56.117 --> 01:40:57.959
MATT: Cadigan.

01:40:57.959 --> 01:40:59.234
MARISHA: No, Halas.

01:40:59.234 --> 01:41:01.139
MATT: Oh, Halas? You roll a history check, too.

01:41:01.139 --> 01:41:03.192
MARISHA: To see if this is his old stash.

01:41:03.192 --> 01:41:04.881
MATT: Yeah, roll a history check.

01:41:04.881 --> 01:41:10.193
MARISHA: That's absolutely horrifying. Ten.

01:41:10.193 --> 01:41:19.084
MATT: If they did teach it, you probably weren't
paying attention that day at the Archive, unfortunately.

01:41:19.084 --> 01:41:23.339
DEBORAH: Would I know it in relation to Sir
Cadigan, the person I took it from?

01:41:23.339 --> 01:41:26.155
MATT: Roll a history check.

01:41:26.818 --> 01:41:28.215
SAM: Come on, Deborah.

01:41:28.215 --> 01:41:30.488
LIAM: Somebody, come on, three rollers.

01:41:30.488 --> 01:41:31.686
DEBORAH: 17.

01:41:31.686 --> 01:41:38.261
MATT: No. None at all. You've never heard the name
Halas before, anywhere in Port Damali or in any of

01:41:38.261 --> 01:41:41.651
your travels, especially in relation to Sir
Cadigan.

01:41:41.651 --> 01:41:51.574
DEBORAH: I turn to everybody, and at first I go,
(straining), nope. Sir Cadigan was a big old

01:41:51.574 --> 01:41:55.577
meanie, but I don't think he had anything to do
with this.

01:41:55.577 --> 01:41:58.785
MARISHA: I mean, you've mentioned Sir Cadigan
being a big old meanie several times. What did he

01:41:58.785 --> 01:42:01.122
do? Did you witness something?

01:42:01.122 --> 01:42:05.483
DEBORAH: (straining) Can't remember. But I think I
might be like this because of him.

01:42:05.483 --> 01:42:06.876
LAURA: Like what?

01:42:06.876 --> 01:42:07.917
SAM: Adorable?

01:42:07.917 --> 01:42:13.930
DEBORAH: (as Trixie) A little weird! (as Twiggy)
Sorry. She talks sometimes.

01:42:13.930 --> 01:42:17.188
SAM: He made you socially awkward?

01:42:17.188 --> 01:42:22.184
DEBORAH: I remember it was really dark, and it was
really long. I had nobody to talk to, so I made up

01:42:22.184 --> 01:42:29.190
all these people to talk to. Finally, when I got
out, wow is it a big, beautiful world! I'm so glad

01:42:29.190 --> 01:42:30.336
I met you guys.

01:42:30.336 --> 01:42:31.071
SAM: You were trapped somewhere?

01:42:31.071 --> 01:42:31.820
DEBORAH: Somewhere.

01:42:31.820 --> 01:42:33.338
LIAM: Were you in this ball?

01:42:33.338 --> 01:42:40.044
DEBORAH: I don't think so. It didn't look like
where I was. All I know, it was that big old

01:42:40.044 --> 01:42:42.215
meanie Sir Cadigan who put me in there.

01:42:42.215 --> 01:42:44.381
LAURA and LIAM: What did he look like?

01:42:44.381 --> 01:42:56.577
DEBORAH: He's twice my size. He's very skinny. He
wore this big ring with a green gem on it. I

01:42:56.577 --> 01:43:00.288
remember because he used to stick his fingers
through the bars to scare me.

01:43:00.288 --> 01:43:02.251
TRAVIS: How'd you escape?

01:43:02.251 --> 01:43:06.334
DEBORAH: I was really tricksy because I would sit
there, and I would think, and I would practice all

01:43:06.334 --> 01:43:15.139
of my tricks. I was able to get him to watch my
trick. He thought that I ran down that way, but

01:43:15.139 --> 01:43:19.646
really I was hiding in the back. I snuck out, and
I ran the other direction. I was able to run, run,

01:43:19.646 --> 01:43:22.081
run! I've been running ever since.

01:43:22.081 --> 01:43:23.278
SAM: This was in Port Damali?

01:43:23.278 --> 01:43:24.348
DEBORAH: Yes.

01:43:24.348 --> 01:43:30.506
TRAVIS: It sounds real familiar.

01:43:30.506 --> 01:43:34.843
LIAM: Why don't you all take ten steps back, and
we'll see what this next hinge does?

01:43:34.843 --> 01:43:36.377
TALIESIN: I'm excited.

01:43:36.377 --> 01:43:41.790
MATT: Okay, you all step back about ten paces.
Anyone want to help, or you going with your

01:43:41.790 --> 01:43:42.838
standard roll?

01:43:42.838 --> 01:43:44.302
LIAM: Oh, investigation for it, yeah.

01:43:44.302 --> 01:43:47.823
MATT: Yep.

01:43:47.823 --> 01:43:50.109
LIAM: Investigation, 21.

01:43:50.109 --> 01:43:57.329
MATT: Okay. That hole appears again. You're unable
to get past that point. You're hitting a barrier,

01:43:57.329 --> 01:44:01.482
and you're clicking it forward. There's something
about the puzzle that's escaping you. You feel

01:44:01.482 --> 01:44:03.770
like you're not quite-- you're on the cusp.

01:44:03.770 --> 01:44:05.205
DEBORAH: Can I help him?

01:44:05.205 --> 01:44:06.951
MATT: If you want to try it again.

01:44:06.951 --> 01:44:11.118
DEBORAH: Just try it again? Okay. Yeah, I'll try
it again. I come up, and I say: I've been

01:44:11.118 --> 01:44:13.055
practicing. Let me try.

01:44:13.055 --> 01:44:15.452
MATT: If you want to, either you both can roll
individually, or one of you can roll with

01:44:15.452 --> 01:44:17.056
advantage as you're helping the other.

01:44:17.056 --> 01:44:18.933
LIAM: I would give me the advantage, probably.

01:44:18.933 --> 01:44:20.781
DEBORAH: I have a plus ten investigation.

01:44:20.781 --> 01:44:22.525
LIAM: Oh, shit!

01:44:22.525 --> 01:44:25.586
TRAVIS: I have a plus ten!

01:44:25.586 --> 01:44:27.861
LIAM: I'm at plus eight. Yeah, sure.

01:44:27.861 --> 01:44:32.192
MATT: As you hand the sphere over, holding the
places, Twiggy goes in and takes hold of it. Both

01:44:32.192 --> 01:44:34.234
of you together begin to try and rotate and figure
it out.

01:44:34.234 --> 01:44:40.117
DEBORAH: I squint my eyes, and I look at it real
hard, and I roll a 28.

01:44:41.982 --> 01:44:47.837
MATT: At that point, both together, Twiggy finds
this small, rotating piece on the very edge that

01:44:47.837 --> 01:44:53.190
turns and turns. As it does, another cylindrical
sphere slowly emits from it, like you're rotating

01:44:53.190 --> 01:44:54.940
a pencil lead that pushes out.

01:44:54.940 --> 01:44:57.717
DEBORAH: It takes three fingers to do it at the
same time.

01:44:57.717 --> 01:45:01.067
MATT: You twist it, and you push it in, and it
actually pushes in about an inch and then clicks

01:45:01.067 --> 01:45:08.463
inside, recessed. As that happens, a top part
opens up a little bit. Caleb, you take that and

01:45:08.463 --> 01:45:16.248
rotate it. As it clicks into place, you hear
(rising tone, whoosh). Flash of green light.

01:45:16.248 --> 01:45:18.378
TRAVIS: Green light's never good.

01:45:18.378 --> 01:45:21.578
MATT: Fills the entire chamber. That's where we're
going to go to break.

01:45:21.578 --> 01:45:24.915
(yelling)

01:45:24.915 --> 01:45:26.558
TRAVIS: And they never come back.

01:45:26.558 --> 01:45:28.477
DEBORAH: And we never return.

01:45:28.477 --> 01:45:32.859
MATT: Well, that was a fun campaign, guys. It was
a lot of fun.

01:45:32.859 --> 01:45:35.805
TALIESIN: (English accent) Don't touch it, Mum,
it's evil!

01:45:35.805 --> 01:45:37.600
SAM: Wow.

01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:40.640
TRAVIS: How many times did you mess with it? Like
six.

01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:41.962
LIAM: Remember that sphere?

01:45:41.962 --> 01:45:45.120
TRAVIS: What's it do? What's it do? (explosion)

01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:50.032
MATT: I love it. Before we go to break, we have a
giveaway. Our fantastic friends at Wyrmwood have

01:45:50.032 --> 01:45:56.159
this amazing dice tray to give away. It is the
wenge dice vault with tiger maple inlay, that

01:45:56.159 --> 01:46:03.024
beautiful two-tone. This will be going to one of
our fantastic victors to this. To enter, you have

01:46:03.024 --> 01:46:07.447
to head over to the Critical Role Twitch chat,
that's twitch.tv/criticalrole, and enter the word

01:46:07.447 --> 01:46:13.636
"stowaway." Stowaway is the word. Enter it once;
more than that, you'll be disqualified. Once

01:46:13.636 --> 01:46:17.635
again, only for people in the US and Canada,
excluding Quebec, because of stupid giveaway laws.

01:46:17.635 --> 01:46:19.946
Anyway, we'll have the winner when we come back.
We'll see you in a few minutes.

01:46:19.946 --> 02:03:40.908
[break]

02:03:42.609 --> 02:03:47.414
MATT: Welcome back, everyone. Before we get into
the game, we do have a winner. The winner of our

02:03:47.414 --> 02:03:54.304
fantastic Wyrmwood dice vault giveaway this
evening is Antc_clueless. Congratulations on your

02:03:54.304 --> 02:04:04.473
complicated online name and your victory. We'll
get this sent to you ASAP. So a flash of green

02:04:04.473 --> 02:04:14.912
light energy fills the chamber. As it subsides,
you all take a second to blink as the light is

02:04:14.912 --> 02:04:23.951
dimmer than it was on the inside of the ship.
Looking about, you are in a very dark chamber.

02:04:23.951 --> 02:04:27.070
You're no longer on the ship.

02:04:27.070 --> 02:04:28.130
DEBORAH: All of us?

02:04:28.130 --> 02:04:36.863
MATT: All of you. Except for Yasha, because she
was not nearby. This chamber is somewhat

02:04:36.863 --> 02:04:44.918
triangular, but the corners are curved. At each of
these walls, between each curvature, there is a

02:04:44.918 --> 02:04:51.219
banner hanging about 12 feet off the ground on a
brass rod. The banner hangs almost to the floor.

02:04:51.219 --> 02:05:00.615
You see four pillars a little closer inside the
chamber. Each banner is a different color. The

02:05:00.615 --> 02:05:09.052
ceiling's about 15 feet high and there are two
corpses on the floor nearby. Both long-dead and

02:05:09.052 --> 02:05:14.595
mummified, their skin paper-thin and pulled
against their bones, their faces twisted in

02:05:14.595 --> 02:05:25.842
horror. You see the light gray stone walls and
where these banners are, there are two on the side

02:05:25.842 --> 02:05:32.548
parallel to each other and two on the other. There
is a red, a green, a blue, and a black. Each of

02:05:32.548 --> 02:05:40.962
these banners has gold embroidery down the sides
and a gold embroidered symbol in the middle. The

02:05:40.962 --> 02:05:44.968
same symbol as the cloak that you found.

02:05:44.968 --> 02:05:50.484
DEBORAH: Did the happy ball of fun tricks come
with us?

02:05:50.484 --> 02:05:51.544
MATT: Nope.

02:05:51.544 --> 02:05:52.864
LAURA: Oh no.

02:05:52.864 --> 02:05:54.373
LIAM: I cast Mage Armor.

02:05:54.373 --> 02:06:00.674
TRAVIS: All four symbols are the same on all four
banners?

02:06:00.674 --> 02:06:01.537
MATT: Mm-hmm.

02:06:01.537 --> 02:06:03.324
MARISHA: It was Hala?

02:06:03.324 --> 02:06:05.483
TRAVIS and MATT: Halas.

02:06:05.483 --> 02:06:07.123
DEBORAH: Exits? Do we see any exits?

02:06:07.123 --> 02:06:07.983
MATT: No.

02:06:07.983 --> 02:06:12.763
DEBORAH: Pedestals, are there anything on them?

02:06:12.763 --> 02:06:18.142
MATT: There are four pillars. They are smooth.
They appear to be either decorative or

02:06:18.142 --> 02:06:21.011
load-bearing, but there is nothing about them that
catches your eye. If you want to take a closer

02:06:21.011 --> 02:06:23.083
look, you can make an investigation check, if you
want.

02:06:23.083 --> 02:06:27.012
SAM: Is the ground dirt, gravel, or stone?

02:06:27.012 --> 02:06:28.358
MATT: Stone as well.

02:06:28.358 --> 02:06:29.296
DEBORAH: 12.

02:06:29.296 --> 02:06:31.553
MATT: Pretty solid and featureless.

02:06:31.553 --> 02:06:39.229
TALIESIN: The two corpses, what can we ascertain
about them? Are they wearing clothing?

02:06:39.229 --> 02:06:40.873
MATT: They are both wearing clothing.

02:06:40.873 --> 02:06:42.966
DEBORAH: Naked.

02:06:42.966 --> 02:06:46.542
TALIESIN: Nudists get trapped in here all the
time.

02:06:46.542 --> 02:06:53.737
MATT: There's not much dust on them. Which means
either it's fresh or not a lot of dust to have collected.

02:06:53.737 --> 02:06:55.672
LIAM: There's no entrances or exits?

02:06:55.672 --> 02:06:59.724
MATT: From what you can see, none. Make a medicine
check.

02:06:59.724 --> 02:07:02.520
LAURA: Does it smell like death in here?

02:07:02.520 --> 02:07:09.958
MATT: There's a faint aura or a faint scent, but
either these corpses do not emanate a lot of

02:07:09.958 --> 02:07:12.990
smell, or it has faded in time.

02:07:12.990 --> 02:07:21.201
DEBORAH: I send my Mage Hand out to move the blue
banner aside to see if there is anything behind there.

02:07:21.201 --> 02:07:23.237
MATT: Okay. Just to give you guys a visual
representation--

02:07:23.237 --> 02:07:25.194
SAM: Just to give us a visual.

02:07:25.194 --> 02:07:28.401
LAURA: Right. Definitely won't lead to anything.

02:07:28.401 --> 02:07:30.233
DEBORAH: For the kids at home.

02:07:30.233 --> 02:07:33.090
SAM: Guys, D&amp;D Beyond.

02:07:33.090 --> 02:07:35.081
LAURA: (singing) D&amp;D!

02:07:35.081 --> 02:07:46.260
SAM: Check your Twitters and Giphys for the gifs
that have already started pouring in. This seems legit.

02:07:46.260 --> 02:07:49.009
MATT: Placing yourselves where you would like to
be in here, if you don't mind telling me where

02:07:49.009 --> 02:07:50.140
you'd like to be placed.

02:07:50.140 --> 02:07:52.081
TRAVIS: Not in the middle, Matthew!

02:07:52.081 --> 02:07:55.829
TALIESIN: I want to be by the corpses. I rolled a
19.

02:07:55.829 --> 02:07:59.129
DEBORAH: I used my Mage Hand, so I need to be
here.

02:07:59.129 --> 02:08:03.754
TRAVIS: (singing) I want to be by the corpses.

02:08:03.754 --> 02:08:06.797
TALIESIN: That was not a sick beat.

02:08:06.797 --> 02:08:08.619
TRAVIS: Let it build.

02:08:08.619 --> 02:08:11.151
LAURA: That was not a sick beat.

02:08:11.151 --> 02:08:17.920
MATT: One here and one here.

02:08:17.920 --> 02:08:22.201
LAURA: They're not right next to each other. I
pictured a lover's embrace.

02:08:22.201 --> 02:08:30.004
TALIESIN: Do they look like violently ended, or do
they look like people who fell asleep and never

02:08:30.004 --> 02:08:31.345
got up?

02:08:31.345 --> 02:08:38.471
MATT: Their faces are twisted in a horrible
expression of ghastly terror or pain, but you

02:08:38.471 --> 02:08:41.970
don't see any wounds. Did you roll a medicine
check?

02:08:41.970 --> 02:08:43.125
TALIESIN: Yeah, 19.

02:08:43.125 --> 02:08:46.080
MATT: Yeah, you don't see any wounds or any
gashes.

02:08:46.080 --> 02:08:49.037
TALIESIN: They definitely got a look like they saw
something wicked awful?

02:08:49.037 --> 02:08:52.957
MATT: Their last moments were probably pretty
terrifying. You moved aside the--

02:08:52.957 --> 02:08:55.413
DEBORAH: With my Mage Hand, from far away.

02:08:55.413 --> 02:08:56.075
MATT: The blue one?

02:08:56.075 --> 02:08:56.744
DEBORAH: Yes.

02:08:56.744 --> 02:09:04.074
MATT: Okay. As it pulls behind, it reveals to be a
statue that is embedded in the wall behind it. Up

02:09:04.074 --> 02:09:13.006
on hind legs with claws in front, you see a dragon
made of stone, carved, wings blending up into the

02:09:13.006 --> 02:09:18.943
stone behind it. Its mouth open, its eyes these
very bright sapphires embedded in its head.

02:09:18.943 --> 02:09:28.905
Immediately as it opens up, the mouth lights up
blue. Make a dexterity saving throw. And Caleb and Nott.

02:09:28.905 --> 02:09:30.431
DEBORAH: I also have evasion.

02:09:30.431 --> 02:09:31.210
MATT: Correct.

02:09:31.210 --> 02:09:34.213
DEBORAH: Not good. Don't do it.

02:09:34.213 --> 02:09:35.240
MATT: What did you roll?

02:09:35.240 --> 02:09:37.030
DEBORAH: I rolled a ten.

02:09:37.030 --> 02:09:38.344
MATT: Okay, still half damage.

02:09:38.344 --> 02:09:39.361
LIAM: 13.

02:09:39.361 --> 02:09:40.465
MATT: Failure.

02:09:40.465 --> 02:09:41.566
SAM: 25.

02:09:41.566 --> 02:09:46.346
MATT: You take no damage, Nott, as you dodge away.
The rest of you watch as this bolt of blue energy

02:09:46.346 --> 02:09:55.272
fires outward as a thick beam of electrical energy
shoots across the room. It hits by and skims the

02:09:55.272 --> 02:10:01.545
front torso of Twiggy as she pulls out of the way.
You watch Caleb spin and take it straight to the

02:10:01.545 --> 02:10:05.355
chest as Nott ducks out of the way.

02:10:05.355 --> 02:10:10.973
LAURA: Is this still the same day? It is. Okay.

02:10:10.973 --> 02:10:12.868
SAM: But we have healed.

02:10:12.868 --> 02:10:13.670
LAURA: Yeah.

02:10:13.670 --> 02:10:18.511
MATT: Caleb, you take 18 points of lightning
damage. Twiggy, you take nine.

02:10:18.511 --> 02:10:24.251
TRAVIS: As Caleb flies backward, I'll summon the
falchion and take a defensive stance.

02:10:24.251 --> 02:10:25.348
MATT: Okay.

02:10:25.348 --> 02:10:28.966
DEBORAH: My hair stands on end a little bit from
the electricity.

02:10:28.966 --> 02:10:31.903
MATT: Okay. Also, make a concentration check.

02:10:31.903 --> 02:10:34.506
DEBORAH: A concentration?

02:10:34.506 --> 02:10:38.039
MATT: For Mage Hand; I believe Mage Hand is
concentration.

02:10:38.039 --> 02:10:40.601
DEBORAH: It's a cantrip.

02:10:40.601 --> 02:10:43.809
MATT: Oh, no, it lasts for a minute. I'm sorry,
you don't need to. It maintains itself. That's my bad.

02:10:43.809 --> 02:10:45.355
DEBORAH: That's okay.

02:10:45.355 --> 02:10:50.077
TRAVIS: Did the burst that came from the blue make
it all the way across the room to the green?

02:10:50.077 --> 02:10:52.542
MATT: It did. It went (crackle) across.

02:10:52.542 --> 02:10:55.077
TRAVIS: It just detonated on the other tapestry?

02:10:55.077 --> 02:10:59.470
MATT: It hit the tapestry and dissipated. The
electrical energy didn't seem to impact or hurt anything.

02:10:59.470 --> 02:11:02.699
DEBORAH: The Mage Hand'll drop the cover back in
front of that.

02:11:02.699 --> 02:11:04.937
MATT: It covers the statue.

02:11:04.937 --> 02:11:06.920
TALIESIN: Let's take a minute before we--

02:11:06.920 --> 02:11:08.558
SAM: Don't do that again!

02:11:08.558 --> 02:11:13.988
LAURA: I have an idea! What if we put on the red
cape and then it does something if the statue

02:11:13.988 --> 02:11:15.769
behind the red thing sees it?

02:11:15.769 --> 02:11:17.140
SAM: Oh! Halas' cape?

02:11:17.140 --> 02:11:18.741
DEBORAH: Do we have it?

02:11:18.741 --> 02:11:20.275
TRAVIS: In the haversack, right?

02:11:20.275 --> 02:11:21.542
LIAM: Yeah, I have it.

02:11:21.542 --> 02:11:22.668
LAURA: Put it on, or something.

02:11:22.668 --> 02:11:23.480
SAM: He's hurt!

02:11:23.480 --> 02:11:24.214
DEBORAH: I'm so sorry.

02:11:24.214 --> 02:11:25.233
LAURA: Caleb, are you okay?

02:11:25.233 --> 02:11:26.719
SAM: Yeah, Twiggy just hurt him.

02:11:26.719 --> 02:11:27.785
DEBORAH: I'm so sorry!

02:11:27.785 --> 02:11:29.629
TALIESIN: Just going to do a quick Cure Wounds.

02:11:29.629 --> 02:11:30.809
DEBORAH: Winning friends!

02:11:30.809 --> 02:11:35.382
TALIESIN: Just one. Oh, that's good! Take 13
points of healing.

02:11:35.382 --> 02:11:36.799
LIAM: <i>Danke.</i>

02:11:36.799 --> 02:11:39.171
TALIESIN: Let's take a second here.

02:11:39.171 --> 02:11:41.696
LAURA: Who wants to put on the red robe?

02:11:41.696 --> 02:11:43.562
TALIESIN: I think we should--

02:11:43.562 --> 02:11:45.339
TRAVIS: I'll do it.

02:11:45.339 --> 02:11:46.943
SAM: It's your ship.

02:11:46.943 --> 02:11:47.941
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:11:47.941 --> 02:11:50.765
TALIESIN: I think we should talk to the locals
before we do anything else.

02:11:50.765 --> 02:11:52.480
TRAVIS: Who are the locals?

02:11:52.480 --> 02:11:53.808
TALIESIN: Oh, these fellows.

02:11:53.808 --> 02:11:54.741
LAURA: The dead guys.

02:11:54.741 --> 02:11:56.999
TRAVIS: Oh! Yeah, forgot you can do that.

02:11:56.999 --> 02:12:03.514
TALIESIN: Oh, I can't pick. Somebody else pick. I
don't know.

02:12:03.514 --> 02:12:04.466
TRAVIS: Which one?

02:12:04.466 --> 02:12:05.598
TALIESIN: Yeah, I don't know.

02:12:05.598 --> 02:12:06.646
TRAVIS: The one closest to you.

02:12:06.646 --> 02:12:12.424
TALIESIN: Yeah, okay. That's level three, right?
Yep, there we are.

02:12:12.424 --> 02:12:15.804
MATT: Is anyone else adjusting their position, or
are you staying where you are?

02:12:15.804 --> 02:12:20.125
LAURA: I'm going to make sure I'm not in line with
any of the banners.

02:12:20.125 --> 02:12:21.532
TRAVIS: Yeah, ditto that shit.

02:12:21.532 --> 02:12:26.000
LAURA: I'm going to step wide. Ugh, I can't reach.
Sorry.

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:27.822
LIAM: The lightning came out of here?

02:12:27.822 --> 02:12:30.140
MATT: Yeah. It went (crackling) through the
chamber.

02:12:30.140 --> 02:12:32.807
DEBORAH: I'll go with Jester, on the other side of
that.

02:12:32.807 --> 02:12:35.610
LAURA: Yeah, I'll do this, right back here.

02:12:35.610 --> 02:12:38.731
DEBORAH: Then I'll be here; I'll be next to that
pillar.

02:12:38.731 --> 02:12:42.889
SAM: Scoot me over somewhere, too, while you're up
there, Marisha.

02:12:42.889 --> 02:12:43.970
MATT: Where do you want to go?

02:12:43.970 --> 02:12:45.423
SAM: Just near Fjord. Boom.

02:12:45.423 --> 02:12:49.786
MATT: All right. Caduceus, the one nearest to you,
you're casting--?

02:12:49.786 --> 02:12:52.108
TALIESIN: Speak With Dead.

02:12:52.108 --> 02:12:57.573
MATT: As you sit there for a second holding your
staff, your shield strapped over the arm, your

02:12:57.573 --> 02:13:04.420
hand goes down. You close your eyes and focus, and
the corpse on the ground staring off, its eyes

02:13:04.420 --> 02:13:14.350
dull and the pupils smoky and gray, breathes in
its chest, seems to inhale, and it holds the air

02:13:14.350 --> 02:13:16.205
there, awaiting your questions.

02:13:16.205 --> 02:13:27.335
TALIESIN: I'm so sorry, friend. You have one more
task to perform before we can let you rest. What

02:13:27.335 --> 02:13:30.054
killed you?

02:13:30.054 --> 02:13:37.872
MATT: "The wailing creature."

02:13:37.872 --> 02:13:50.490
TALIESIN: The wailing creature. What color was the
curtain the wailing creature hid behind?

02:13:50.490 --> 02:13:55.287
MATT: "Onyx black."

02:13:55.287 --> 02:14:00.534
TALIESIN: Good to know. How did you end up here?

02:14:00.534 --> 02:14:02.989
TRAVIS: Yes! Thank you, Taliesin!

02:14:03.087 --> 02:14:12.924
MATT: "We had found an object and toyed with it."

02:14:12.924 --> 02:14:14.806
SAM: Just like us.

02:14:14.806 --> 02:14:18.115
LIAM: Did any of his friends get out?

02:14:18.115 --> 02:14:21.141
TALIESIN: What's the name of that--

02:14:21.141 --> 02:14:22.464
SAM: Halas?

02:14:22.464 --> 02:14:30.038
TALIESIN: What does the name Halas mean to you?

02:14:30.038 --> 02:14:32.363
MATT: "Nothing."

02:14:32.363 --> 02:14:34.430
TALIESIN: Well, that's no help.

02:14:34.430 --> 02:14:36.202
MATT: Four questions; you've got one more.

02:14:36.202 --> 02:14:37.263
LAURA: Oh god!

02:14:37.263 --> 02:14:40.229
SAM: Did anyone escape?

02:14:40.229 --> 02:14:43.480
TALIESIN: Do you know how to get out of here?

02:14:43.480 --> 02:14:50.581
MATT: "No." That final bit of trapped air in the
lung escapes and it falls to stillness once more.

02:14:50.581 --> 02:14:54.373
TALIESIN: I'm going to give him a little pop and
seed him for later.

02:14:54.373 --> 02:14:56.552
MATT: Okay, so you're casting Decompose on him?

02:14:56.552 --> 02:14:57.348
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

02:14:57.348 --> 02:14:58.357
DEBORAH: Nice trick!

02:14:58.357 --> 02:15:01.100
TALIESIN: Thank you. Well, that was a little
helpful.

02:15:01.100 --> 02:15:03.966
SAM: It was a lot helpful! So we know blue, bad,
black, bad--

02:15:03.966 --> 02:15:07.767
DEBORAH: Probably green and red bad.

02:15:07.767 --> 02:15:10.659
SAM: Well, maybe one of them is a good! Maybe one
of them's a way out of here!

02:15:10.659 --> 02:15:11.816
DEBORAH: Maybe.

02:15:11.816 --> 02:15:15.550
LAURA: You should put on the robe. Did you put on
the robe? I can help you put on the robe.

02:15:15.550 --> 02:15:17.853
TRAVIS: No, I'm trying to put it on. Does it fit?

02:15:17.853 --> 02:15:22.871
MATT: It's a little tight on you, but it fits.
You're slender for a half-orc.

02:15:22.871 --> 02:15:26.229
TRAVIS: I'm fucking fit, okay?

02:15:26.229 --> 02:15:29.483
MATT: You can be fit and slender.

02:15:29.483 --> 02:15:32.213
TALIESIN: Maybe they're all bad.

02:15:32.213 --> 02:15:34.194
LIAM: Hey man, you let strength be the dump stat.

02:15:34.194 --> 02:15:40.021
DEBORAH: We could stand out of the way and my Mage
Hand could open them all, if we felt like-- There

02:15:40.021 --> 02:15:42.007
could be--

02:15:42.007 --> 02:15:43.328
LAURA: The wailing creature could--

02:15:43.328 --> 02:15:45.015
DEBORAH: Yeah, it wouldn't matter where we stood.

02:15:45.015 --> 02:15:47.555
LAURA: Yeah, but he is in line with the wailing
creature.

02:15:47.555 --> 02:15:58.231
LIAM: I have an idea. I can make a magical hut
that nothing can pass through.

02:15:58.231 --> 02:16:02.480
TRAVIS: That is an excellent way to try and figure
out what the fuck's going on in here.

02:16:02.480 --> 02:16:09.278
LIAM: I am going to begin to take the minute to
cast Leomund's Tiny Hut in the center of the room.

02:16:09.278 --> 02:16:10.323
MATT: Okay.

02:16:10.323 --> 02:16:11.270
TRAVIS: An observation deck.

02:16:11.270 --> 02:16:12.479
DEBORAH: In the center of the room, okay.

02:16:12.479 --> 02:16:13.879
LAURA: Ooh, the center.

02:16:13.879 --> 02:16:16.351
MARISHA: Like one of those bomb shelter walls.

02:16:16.351 --> 02:16:20.550
LIAM: It's a ten-foot radius, and everyone is
allowed to enter and exit.

02:16:20.550 --> 02:16:24.557
MATT: A ten-foot radius would be a bit bigger than
that, so that would be the ten-foot radius.

02:16:24.557 --> 02:16:25.824
LAURA: Can we all fit inside of it?

02:16:25.824 --> 02:16:31.279
LIAM: Absolutely. But I have to stay in the center
of it where it is safe.

02:16:31.279 --> 02:16:33.765
SAM: But someone needs to step out of it in order
to trigger the other--

02:16:33.765 --> 02:16:35.727
DEBORAH: Well, can I send Mage Hand through it?

02:16:35.727 --> 02:16:42.992
LIAM: You can stick your hand through the barrier
and cast Mage Hand and pull back in, yeah.

02:16:42.992 --> 02:16:45.022
MATT: So everyone is moving into it?

02:16:45.022 --> 02:16:51.149
LAURA: I want to stay, still, as much away from a
line-up as we-- like, in front of the things.

02:16:51.149 --> 02:16:53.616
MATT: There's not a whole lot of space there.

02:16:53.616 --> 02:16:57.521
TRAVIS: You know, it's just a thought, but if we
have to open two of these that are facing each

02:16:57.521 --> 02:17:00.852
other at the same time so they destroy each other,
we'll probably have to drop that down.

02:17:00.852 --> 02:17:03.675
LIAM: This is impervious to-- yeah.

02:17:03.675 --> 02:17:04.749
TRAVIS: We'll get there.

02:17:04.749 --> 02:17:06.963
LIAM: We'll get there. We can experiment because
this is impervious.

02:17:06.963 --> 02:17:08.023
TRAVIS: I like it.

02:17:08.023 --> 02:17:09.491
TALIESIN: So we already know what two of these
are.

02:17:09.491 --> 02:17:10.160
DEBORAH: Right.

02:17:10.160 --> 02:17:14.810
MARISHA: What if you unleash the wailing creature
and we have to deal with it?

02:17:14.810 --> 02:17:16.648
LIAM: It cannot come in here.

02:17:16.648 --> 02:17:18.288
TRAVIS: What about sound?

02:17:18.288 --> 02:17:21.367
DEBORAH: How long does it last?

02:17:21.367 --> 02:17:31.070
LIAM: Oh, hours. That is a good point, although I
have a decent supply of honeycomb. We could knead

02:17:31.070 --> 02:17:33.905
it up and make earplugs for ourselves.

02:17:33.905 --> 02:17:35.948
TRAVIS: That is really resourceful.

02:17:35.948 --> 02:17:37.324
DEBORAH: And I have gum.

02:17:37.324 --> 02:17:40.613
LIAM: That's just as good or better. You are
clever.

02:17:40.613 --> 02:17:42.807
DEBORAH: Yeah! Thank you!

02:17:42.807 --> 02:17:44.105
SAM: Sure.

02:17:44.105 --> 02:17:46.393
TRAVIS: Where did her gum come from?

02:17:46.393 --> 02:17:49.795
MARISHA: It's survival.

02:17:49.795 --> 02:17:52.255
SAM: Well, let's do some honeycomb, then.

02:17:52.255 --> 02:17:53.778
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:17:53.778 --> 02:17:56.172
MARISHA: I'll take the gum. I'm not proud.

02:17:56.172 --> 02:18:02.483
TALIESIN: I feel like I was told as a child not to
put things in my ears, but I guess I'm doing this.

02:18:02.483 --> 02:18:04.739
LAURA: I'm going to soften it up with my mouth.

02:18:04.739 --> 02:18:06.386
LIAM: Before and after, okay.

02:18:06.386 --> 02:18:09.167
TALIESIN: I wonder what's behind green.

02:18:09.167 --> 02:18:10.545
TRAVIS: Yeah, me too.

02:18:10.545 --> 02:18:11.671
DEBORAH: Okay.

02:18:11.671 --> 02:18:12.464
TRAVIS: Do it.

02:18:12.464 --> 02:18:18.192
DEBORAH: All right, I'll sneak over to that side
so I can see it, and I'm going to put just my hand

02:18:18.192 --> 02:18:22.669
outside of the area of the hut.

02:18:22.669 --> 02:18:26.108
TRAVIS: You don't need that hand, you got another
one.

02:18:26.108 --> 02:18:27.932
DEBORAH: It has vocal components. Do I need to
lean my head out?

02:18:27.932 --> 02:18:31.604
MATT: Don't make this the second time I've taken a
hand of yours.

02:18:31.604 --> 02:18:34.406
DEBORAH: But my new hand is so cool!

02:18:34.406 --> 02:18:36.223
MATT: Sorry. So?

02:18:36.223 --> 02:18:41.977
DEBORAH: If there's a vocal component-- only I
have to be able to hear it-- do I need to stick my

02:18:41.977 --> 02:18:43.102
head out?

02:18:43.102 --> 02:18:45.953
MATT: As far as you know, it doesn't affect you in
a volume or noise way.

02:18:45.953 --> 02:18:52.700
DEBORAH: Okay. So I whisper something and I move
my hand and that silvery, spectral hand comes off,

02:18:52.700 --> 02:19:00.480
and it goes forward toward the green. I pull my
own hand back and get back into the space, and I

02:19:00.480 --> 02:19:03.883
tell it to push the green flag aside.

02:19:03.883 --> 02:19:13.022
MATT: You have to move over here, probably, to get
into range. As you pull back the green tapestry--

02:19:13.022 --> 02:19:17.375
LAURA: I'm going to crouch, even in the thing.

02:19:17.375 --> 02:19:26.622
MATT: You crouch down? Okay. As you pull it back,
you see a statue behind it that looks to be some

02:19:26.622 --> 02:19:36.918
horribly mutated humanoid creature. Its body is
bulbous and covered in sores, its neck is swollen

02:19:36.918 --> 02:19:46.013
like a toad's, its mouth and jaw open with rows of
teeth, all made of stone. As it pulls back, this

02:19:46.013 --> 02:19:52.951
gaseous green fume spews from its mouth that fills
the chamber around it. About half the chamber

02:19:52.951 --> 02:19:57.696
begins to fill with this before it dissipates, but
it does not cross the boundaries of the hut.

02:19:57.696 --> 02:20:00.162
TRAVIS: Ooh, shit.

02:20:00.162 --> 02:20:02.396
DEBORAH: Red?

02:20:02.396 --> 02:20:08.010
TALIESIN: Sound; a beam; there's a screech;
there's a gas.

02:20:08.010 --> 02:20:10.875
DEBORAH: Well, light, sound, gas.

02:20:10.875 --> 02:20:14.468
SAM: Smell? Sound? Vision?

02:20:14.468 --> 02:20:16.238
TALIESIN: I don't know what goes next.

02:20:16.238 --> 02:20:17.613
MATT: What are you doing next?

02:20:17.613 --> 02:20:18.486
DEBORAH: Should I try it?

02:20:18.486 --> 02:20:20.584
LAURA: Do the red! Maybe it's fire.

02:20:20.584 --> 02:20:27.295
DEBORAH: I move over to be in line with the red,
and I stick my hand out, and it flies out, the

02:20:27.295 --> 02:20:31.494
spectral hand. I pull back into the safety, and it
pushes aside the red.

02:20:31.494 --> 02:20:40.940
MATT: It pulls aside the red. Behind it, you see
emerge a wooden door of red-painted material and

02:20:40.940 --> 02:20:45.759
the similar symbol of Halas painted across the
surface.

02:20:45.759 --> 02:20:46.941
TRAVIS: Red doors are bad.

02:20:46.941 --> 02:20:47.742
SAM: That's the way out!

02:20:47.742 --> 02:20:51.360
DEBORAH: Should the Mage Hand try to open it, you
guys? I can send my hand to try and open it.

02:20:51.360 --> 02:20:55.081
LIAM: We are still safe in here. Yeah, I think
so.

02:20:55.081 --> 02:20:56.733
DEBORAH: Captain Fjord?

02:20:56.733 --> 02:20:57.816
TRAVIS: Proceed.

02:20:57.816 --> 02:21:05.262
DEBORAH: Sweet! I whisper, and I direct it a
little bit. It comes down, and it grabs a knob? A handle?

02:21:05.262 --> 02:21:06.661
MATT: There is a handle there.

02:21:06.661 --> 02:21:08.081
DEBORAH: A handle, and it's going to turn.

02:21:08.081 --> 02:21:10.494
MATT: (clicking) It's locked.

02:21:10.494 --> 02:21:14.340
LAURA: Hmm. Ooh! Fjord, look in your pockets!

02:21:14.340 --> 02:21:15.666
TRAVIS: Why?

02:21:15.666 --> 02:21:18.115
LAURA: Of the red robe! Look in the pockets of the
red robe!

02:21:18.131 --> 02:21:26.535
DEBORAH: I call it back to me. I pull out of my
purse a little set of tools on a ring, and I give

02:21:26.535 --> 02:21:32.257
it to the hand and whisper it off again to go see
if it can pick the lock.

02:21:32.257 --> 02:21:36.468
MATT: The hand hovers across. Roll an ability
check, adding your dexterity modifier and your

02:21:36.468 --> 02:21:38.111
proficiency modifier.

02:21:38.111 --> 02:21:41.938
DEBORAH: My thieves' tools? That's a 29.

02:21:41.938 --> 02:21:43.610
LAURA: Whoa!

02:21:44.460 --> 02:21:49.383
SAM: I don't have to do shit. I'm just going to
sit there, drinking.

02:21:51.174 --> 02:22:01.499
MATT: It takes a few minutes. This is an intricate
lock. As you watch the hand finish with the third

02:22:01.499 --> 02:22:10.110
tool that is being held between the mystical
pinkie, you hear a slight clink, like a spring

02:22:10.110 --> 02:22:21.642
snapped or moved. The front of the door here
bursts into flame, burning out in the area. It

02:22:21.642 --> 02:22:28.661
burns solid for a good 30 seconds. Surrounded by
flame, all of you are being lit by this. You're

02:22:28.661 --> 02:22:33.472
wincing from the heat you feel you should be
feeling, but it's all being held at bay by the

02:22:33.472 --> 02:22:39.912
hut's boundaries. Eventually, the flames die out,
the door, tapestry both untouched.

02:22:40.200 --> 02:22:43.750
DEBORAH: I pull the hand back to me, and I take my
keys, ow! Back in my pouch.

02:22:43.750 --> 02:22:45.657
MATT: Yeah, they're very hot.

02:22:45.657 --> 02:22:47.423
TRAVIS: Can I search the pockets of the red coat?

02:22:47.423 --> 02:22:49.684
MATT: Sure. Make an investigation check.

02:22:51.446 --> 02:22:53.357
TALIESIN: Feels a bit extreme.

02:22:54.557 --> 02:22:56.257
SAM: Deep pockets!

02:22:56.555 --> 02:22:57.941
LAURA: Natural one?

02:22:57.941 --> 02:22:59.839
TRAVIS: Seven.

02:22:59.839 --> 02:23:02.035
MATT: There are no pockets on the robe.

02:23:02.035 --> 02:23:04.867
TRAVIS: No pockets!

02:23:04.867 --> 02:23:07.778
SAM: That door is still closed?

02:23:07.778 --> 02:23:11.238
MATT: Yeah. It's a heavy cloak, if you will.

02:23:11.238 --> 02:23:14.910
SAM: So there's no way in or out, and every door
is bad.

02:23:14.910 --> 02:23:16.888
TRAVIS: Well, we haven't pulled the black curtain
back yet.

02:23:16.888 --> 02:23:19.065
SAM: Well, that was the wailing one. The guy said
it was the wailing one.

02:23:19.065 --> 02:23:21.168
LAURA: We should see what it is, though.

02:23:21.206 --> 02:23:27.820
LIAM: We have heard everything that happened
outside of this bubble. If it is wailing at us, I

02:23:27.820 --> 02:23:31.291
don't know what that would entail for us.

02:23:31.291 --> 02:23:34.888
TALIESIN: That says that the door is trapped, not
necessarily that the door is unopenable.

02:23:34.888 --> 02:23:37.885
LIAM: Yeah, that's correct. Nott, you could at
least give it a whirl.

02:23:37.885 --> 02:23:39.701
SAM: Give what a whirl?

02:23:39.701 --> 02:23:43.051
LIAM: Picking that lock. We are in here for
another seven hours and 40 minutes.

02:23:43.051 --> 02:23:46.360
SAM: Oh, I thought you picked that lock. The red
one?

02:23:46.360 --> 02:23:51.567
MATT: It triggered something, but you feel
confident.

02:23:51.567 --> 02:23:55.710
DEBORAH: I'll send the hand back out to try the
handle again.

02:23:55.710 --> 02:23:58.738
MATT: (click, door creaking) It opens up.

02:23:58.738 --> 02:24:00.416
LIAM: You've got to follow through.

02:24:00.416 --> 02:24:03.368
DEBORAH: Sorry guys, I'm a little absent-minded.

02:24:03.368 --> 02:24:05.683
TALIESIN: I mean, there's a lot going on right
now.

02:24:05.683 --> 02:24:07.487
SAM: We have a way out!

02:24:07.487 --> 02:24:10.023
LAURA: Should we just go out, then?

02:24:10.023 --> 02:24:14.457
TALIESIN: I'm going to double-check these bodies
for things before we go. If anyone wants to help

02:24:14.457 --> 02:24:15.946
me with an investigation check--

02:24:15.946 --> 02:24:17.608
SAM: I'll help you.

02:24:17.608 --> 02:24:19.580
DEBORAH: You want me to look? I'll go look!

02:24:19.580 --> 02:24:20.884
MATT: Go for it.

02:24:20.884 --> 02:24:22.131
DEBORAH: You're going to help me?

02:24:22.131 --> 02:24:23.313
TALIESIN: Sure.

02:24:23.607 --> 02:24:25.601
SAM: Great! I'm getting day drunk!

02:24:25.601 --> 02:24:26.747
DEBORAH: 27.

02:24:26.747 --> 02:24:32.212
MATT: Whew. You give a thorough pass. They are
picked clean. In fact, you find the belt on one of

02:24:32.212 --> 02:24:37.650
them seems to have been broken forcefully, and a
couple of pieces of leather that are pinched where

02:24:37.650 --> 02:24:42.762
a belt pouch may have been resting for a while.
Missing. Somebody has completely rolled these

02:24:42.762 --> 02:24:45.100
corpses and picked them clean already.

02:24:45.100 --> 02:24:46.815
DEBORAH: Sorry, buddy.

02:24:46.815 --> 02:24:51.005
TALIESIN: Seems that they were robbed before they
came in here. It's weird.

02:24:51.005 --> 02:24:53.587
DEBORAH: Or while they were in here.

02:24:53.587 --> 02:24:55.383
TALIESIN: Oh, that's even crazier.

02:24:55.383 --> 02:25:01.224
DEBORAH: Is there a way to tell if they were
robbed post-mortem or pre-mortem? I don't know!

02:25:01.224 --> 02:25:03.441
How do you tell that?

02:25:03.441 --> 02:25:05.192
MATT: Make a medicine check.

02:25:06.272 --> 02:25:08.638
MARISHA: This is some Bones shit.

02:25:09.312 --> 02:25:10.314
DEBORAH: 14.

02:25:10.326 --> 02:25:16.616
MATT: I mean, you glance around the areas. There's
not much to really pull from that type of

02:25:16.616 --> 02:25:19.742
material. You don't see any heavy bruising like
they were forcefully pulled from them while they

02:25:19.742 --> 02:25:22.591
were living, necessarily. It's hard to tell.

02:25:22.591 --> 02:25:30.060
SAM: Before we do anything, I'm going to whisper
to Jester: You know, I like Twiggy, but she picks

02:25:30.060 --> 02:25:37.728
all the locks, she does the Mage Hand thing, she
does the Hideous Laughter thing, she paints.

02:25:37.728 --> 02:25:39.545
LAURA: She makes a duplicate of herself.

02:25:39.545 --> 02:25:40.791
SAM: She has a cute animal.

02:25:40.791 --> 02:25:42.212
LAURA: And she likes chocolate!

02:25:42.212 --> 02:25:47.725
SAM: Are we being replaced? Is this some joke?

02:25:47.725 --> 02:25:50.141
LAURA: I mean, I don't know.

02:25:50.141 --> 02:25:52.600
SAM: Maybe they don't need us any more.

02:25:52.600 --> 02:25:55.119
LAURA: Maybe they brought her on purpose and they
don't want us anymore.

02:25:55.119 --> 02:25:56.218
SAM: Oh my god!

02:25:56.218 --> 02:25:57.479
LAURA: It's possible.

02:25:57.479 --> 02:25:59.373
SAM: Let's kill her.

02:25:59.373 --> 02:26:01.050
LAURA: Well...

02:26:01.050 --> 02:26:02.152
SAM: When the moment is right.

02:26:02.152 --> 02:26:03.730
LAURA: Okay, okay.

02:26:03.730 --> 02:26:05.667
(laughter)

02:26:07.616 --> 02:26:09.373
MATT: So what are you guys doing?

02:26:09.373 --> 02:26:11.692
LIAM: I am placing Frumpkin outside of the
bubble.

02:26:11.692 --> 02:26:14.328
LAURA: He always sends Frumpkin in to die.

02:26:14.328 --> 02:26:16.449
LIAM: I am going to go look in the next room.

02:26:16.449 --> 02:26:17.825
DEBORAH: But I love that cat!

02:26:17.825 --> 02:26:20.344
MATT: Okay, roll a perception check for Frumpkin.

02:26:22.693 --> 02:26:24.129
LIAM: 13.

02:26:24.779 --> 02:26:30.625
MATT: Okay. Frumpkin goes up to the doorway and
looks. It is a dark hallway, no light. Frumpkin

02:26:30.625 --> 02:26:36.012
sees a little bit of light, but it's above, like
there seems to be an incline. It's above and to

02:26:36.012 --> 02:26:40.176
the right. It's not a straight, narrow hall. It
seems a little oddly angled.

02:26:40.176 --> 02:26:43.382
LIAM: You know, I could throw some light out
there, but I don't really want to announce our

02:26:43.382 --> 02:26:45.179
presence. What do you think we should do?

02:26:45.179 --> 02:26:46.912
LAURA: Does Frumpkin hear anyone?

02:26:46.912 --> 02:26:51.350
LIAM: He would have told me if he heard-- I can't
hear you.

02:26:51.350 --> 02:26:59.257
TALIESIN: I mean, we did just cause a giant
lightning thing. I feel like our presence has been announced.

02:26:59.257 --> 02:27:01.482
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're fine.

02:27:01.482 --> 02:27:03.369
TALIESIN: I'm going to light up my staff, at any
rate.

02:27:03.369 --> 02:27:04.996
LIAM: I come out of it.

02:27:04.996 --> 02:27:08.520
MATT: The light source on the staff now emanates
and the chamber is lit well.

02:27:08.520 --> 02:27:14.072
LIAM: I don't want to really announce our presence
if there's somebody out there. I don't know.

02:27:14.072 --> 02:27:16.213
MATT: This is open on this side.

02:27:16.213 --> 02:27:18.067
(oohing)

02:27:18.067 --> 02:27:19.749
DEBORAH: Fancy!

02:27:19.749 --> 02:27:21.452
MATT: I got to use that piece finally.

02:27:21.452 --> 02:27:23.893
TRAVIS: Well, we're not going anywhere in here.
Who wants to come with?

02:27:23.893 --> 02:27:25.237
LAURA: All of us.

02:27:25.237 --> 02:27:27.790
TALIESIN: Although we should probably have someone
check ahead, just for traps.

02:27:27.790 --> 02:27:30.135
DEBORAH: Ooh! I'm sneaky sneaky! Unless you want
to do it.

02:27:30.135 --> 02:27:39.937
SAM: No. You just go. No, it's fine, you do it.
Nope, you've got it. I'm fine.

02:27:45.096 --> 02:27:47.611
Have fun. Tell me how it goes.

02:27:47.907 --> 02:27:49.557
TRAVIS: Jester, Nott, y'all okay?

02:27:49.557 --> 02:27:51.019
SAM: and LAURA: We're fine.

02:27:51.019 --> 02:27:53.248
SAM: We're <i>fine</i>, Fjord. Everything's <i>fine</i>.

02:27:53.248 --> 02:27:55.182
LAURA: Don't worry about us.

02:27:55.182 --> 02:27:57.582
TRAVIS: They just turn on you that fast.

02:27:57.582 --> 02:27:59.774
MARISHA: I don't-- I think-- We'll talk later.

02:27:59.774 --> 02:28:01.345
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:28:01.345 --> 02:28:03.267
LIAM: Caleb says nothing.

02:28:03.267 --> 02:28:06.152
TALIESIN: Nope.

02:28:06.453 --> 02:28:10.671
DEBORAH: In fact, Twiggy's not even really going
to wait. She starts to chase the cat. She wants to

02:28:10.671 --> 02:28:12.544
go see the cat and pet the cat.

02:28:12.544 --> 02:28:15.152
MATT: Okay, so Twiggy leaves the radius and starts
heading towards the far end of the room.

02:28:15.152 --> 02:28:17.461
DEBORAH: I'm going to sneakily do it, though.

02:28:17.461 --> 02:28:19.070
MATT: All right, roll a stealth check.

02:28:20.211 --> 02:28:21.453
DEBORAH: 17.

02:28:21.453 --> 02:28:26.015
MATT: Good to know. What are the rest of you
doing? You watch as Twiggy just leaves and starts

02:28:26.015 --> 02:28:27.439
heading towards the door.

02:28:27.439 --> 02:28:29.440
SAM: Oh, now we have to go. We can't let her die.

02:28:29.440 --> 02:28:30.628
LAURA: We should follow her.

02:28:30.628 --> 02:28:32.036
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll follow Twiggy.

02:28:32.036 --> 02:28:37.321
LIAM: I'm going to watch everyone safely go to the
door and not get killed, and then drop the bubble.

02:28:37.321 --> 02:28:42.908
LAURA: I walk behind Fjord and I cast Blessing of
the Trickster when I touch your back.

02:28:42.908 --> 02:28:44.663
TRAVIS: Thanks, Jester.

02:28:44.663 --> 02:28:46.400
LIAM: It would stay there, yeah.

02:28:46.400 --> 02:28:48.619
TALIESIN: Yeah, but we'll know it's there, just in
case.

02:28:48.619 --> 02:28:54.104
MATT: All right. As everyone finds their way to
the door safely, you feel the moment to leave the field--

02:28:54.104 --> 02:28:55.862
LIAM: Oh yeah, if I leave, it's gone.

02:28:55.862 --> 02:28:57.523
TALIESIN: Oh, well then never mind.

02:28:57.523 --> 02:28:59.202
MATT: So the hut vanishes. Spell's expended.

02:28:59.202 --> 02:29:01.182
LIAM: Hightail it out of this fucking room!

02:29:01.182 --> 02:29:03.169
TRAVIS: That was well used, my man.

02:29:03.169 --> 02:29:06.027
MATT: You guys exit and make your way into the
hallway. The hallway itself drops temperature

02:29:06.027 --> 02:29:12.413
dramatically. It's similar to the space that you
guys were in last time. You feel for the edges and

02:29:12.413 --> 02:29:20.348
there's no real shape or texture to it. It's just
solid. It feels almost like stone, but not quite.

02:29:20.348 --> 02:29:32.363
It's hard to place. As you're stepping into the
chamber, I would say Nott and Fjord, you both get

02:29:32.363 --> 02:29:39.157
just a hint of vertigo. You glance and you take a
step into the hallway and it's an incline. You

02:29:39.157 --> 02:29:43.396
look up and you can see the light. It's hard to
make out, but you see a faint bit of light at the

02:29:43.396 --> 02:29:46.688
end of it, maybe a hundred or so feet ahead of
you.

02:29:46.688 --> 02:29:49.692
SAM: Vertigo just from the shape of the room?

02:29:49.692 --> 02:29:55.520
MATT: Just like stepping into the room and having
no real idea of where the walls and ceiling and

02:29:55.520 --> 02:29:59.211
floor are. It just looks like a black shape and
you're feeling some walls, but they're a little

02:29:59.211 --> 02:30:04.798
rounded. It's a strange aspect to this hallway.

02:30:04.798 --> 02:30:07.253
LAURA: Does the floor seem rounded, too?

02:30:07.253 --> 02:30:09.827
MATT: No, the floor just seems like a steady
incline.

02:30:09.827 --> 02:30:12.637
DEBORAH: We don't see light or anything at the end
of it?

02:30:12.637 --> 02:30:18.309
MATT: You see the end of the tunnel, but you can't
make out what's on the other side. It's too far.

02:30:18.599 --> 02:30:21.733
SAM: Can you make light? Is anyone? We need light.

02:30:21.733 --> 02:30:23.369
TALIESIN: I was making light.

02:30:23.369 --> 02:30:25.268
LIAM: With your staff, yeah?

02:30:25.268 --> 02:30:30.426
MATT: As Caduceus steps in with the staff, the
light seems to be crushed down to where you can

02:30:30.426 --> 02:30:35.046
see the faint bit of it there, but there's
something about this hallway that's swallowing the

02:30:35.046 --> 02:30:40.354
light or at least compressing it to where it's not
giving off much of a radius while you are standing in it.

02:30:41.594 --> 02:30:45.141
SAM: That's weird. Do we press ahead?

02:30:45.427 --> 02:30:46.816
TALIESIN: I mean.

02:30:47.090 --> 02:30:49.019
DEBORAH: No other way to go.

02:30:49.019 --> 02:30:51.377
TALIESIN: Can you see anything, Beau?

02:30:51.377 --> 02:31:01.255
MARISHA: That's what I was going to ask. It's a
forceful darkness and looking at Fjord get

02:31:01.255 --> 02:31:06.705
nauseous, does this remind me of any ghostly
presence that I experienced before?

02:31:06.705 --> 02:31:08.974
MATT: Not necessarily, but make a perception check
for me.

02:31:08.974 --> 02:31:11.332
LIAM: Do I recognize it as an obvious arcane
effect?

02:31:11.332 --> 02:31:13.295
MATT: Make an arcana check.

02:31:13.295 --> 02:31:14.917
MARISHA: Oh my god.

02:31:14.917 --> 02:31:16.688
LIAM: Natural 20.

02:31:16.688 --> 02:31:18.775
MARISHA: 11.

02:31:18.775 --> 02:31:26.654
MATT: You can't make out much detail beyond the
end of the hallway. You, however, there's

02:31:26.654 --> 02:31:32.351
something about this that feels extraplanar.
Meaning the end of this doorway, whatever's at the

02:31:32.351 --> 02:31:37.930
other end, is being tethered by something that's
not really material space. You don't know what

02:31:37.930 --> 02:31:40.632
distance you're traveling between these two
objects.

02:31:40.632 --> 02:31:47.483
LIAM: Okay, I relay this to the group. We jumped
dimensions to get here, and whatever is laying

02:31:47.483 --> 02:31:53.170
before is not a hallway. In a way it is, but not
the traditional sense.

02:31:53.170 --> 02:31:55.136
SAM: But it might even be the way back out.

02:31:55.136 --> 02:31:56.257
LIAM: It might be, yeah.

02:31:56.257 --> 02:31:58.688
TRAVIS: As we turn around and look at the door
that we came back through, are there any markings

02:31:58.688 --> 02:32:00.574
above the door or around it?

02:32:00.574 --> 02:32:02.330
MATT: Perception check.

02:32:02.330 --> 02:32:04.998
TALIESIN: I'm going to roll Eyes of the Grave,
too, just to see if anything--

02:32:04.998 --> 02:32:07.272
TRAVIS: 20! No. 19.

02:32:07.272 --> 02:32:14.450
MATT: No. In fact, it's weird because the doorway
itself is this well carved inlaid beautiful door.

02:32:14.450 --> 02:32:18.507
As soon as you step into the hallway and look at
the opposite end, the hallway is just flush with

02:32:18.507 --> 02:32:26.801
the exterior of it and seems to curve out into the
rest of the hallway. It seems intentionally placed

02:32:26.801 --> 02:32:33.185
to match perfectly, but has a natural feel to its
shape. It's weird.

02:32:33.185 --> 02:32:36.455
LIAM: You said we can see the end of this
passageway, but not what's beyond it.

02:32:36.455 --> 02:32:38.206
MATT: Correct.

02:32:38.206 --> 02:32:40.247
TALIESIN: I'm rolling Eyes of the Grave. Just for
the hell of it.

02:32:40.247 --> 02:32:42.736
MATT: Right. Nothing comes up.

02:32:42.736 --> 02:32:44.136
SAM: Well, Twiggy?

02:32:44.136 --> 02:32:45.275
DEBORAH: I'm happy to keep going.

02:32:45.275 --> 02:32:46.188
SAM: All right.

02:32:46.188 --> 02:32:47.567
MATT: Marching order, please?

02:32:47.567 --> 02:32:48.672
DEBORAH: I'll be in first.

02:32:48.672 --> 02:32:51.370
TRAVIS: Twiggy, 50 feet behind everyone else.

02:32:51.370 --> 02:32:52.731
MATT: Who's after Twiggy?

02:32:52.731 --> 02:32:54.143
DEBORAH: I'm skipping.

02:32:54.143 --> 02:32:56.008
SAM: I'll go after Twiggy.

02:32:56.008 --> 02:32:57.865
MATT: Nott and Twiggy. Who's after Nott?

02:32:57.865 --> 02:32:59.666
LAURA: I'll go after Nott.

02:32:59.666 --> 02:33:01.007
TRAVIS: I'll go after Jester.

02:33:01.007 --> 02:33:02.637
MARISHA: I'll be after Fjord.

02:33:02.637 --> 02:33:04.367
TALIESIN: I'll be after Beau.

02:33:04.367 --> 02:33:05.964
MATT: Caleb in the back.

02:33:05.964 --> 02:33:09.755
SAM: Always. Hey, we're sort of in size order!

02:33:09.755 --> 02:33:13.725
LAURA: Hey Caleb! You know in haunted houses a lot
of time they attack the person in the back.

02:33:13.725 --> 02:33:15.629
TALIESIN: I'm paying attention.

02:33:15.629 --> 02:33:18.187
DEBORAH: I'm skipping stealthily.

02:33:18.187 --> 02:33:20.418
TALIESIN: (singing) Tiptoe through the tulips.

02:33:20.418 --> 02:33:22.420
DEBORAH: Like Bugs Bunny.

02:33:22.420 --> 02:33:26.302
LAURA: No, that's a really creepy song from,
that's from Insidious.

02:33:26.302 --> 02:33:35.686
MATT: You continue along this hallway, walking. It
takes you a moment to realize, but as you're

02:33:35.686 --> 02:33:41.180
moving forward, the light seems to turn. Like
whatever this source is, the light shifts

02:33:41.180 --> 02:33:46.151
slightly. Like whatever source is there seems to
have some sort of movement. As you're paying

02:33:46.151 --> 02:33:50.794
attention and the closer you get to it, you begin
to see it's like a flickering of firelight, there's a

02:33:50.794 --> 02:33:57.240
flame-based light source within whatever this next
area is, but it seems to be rotating. You begin to

02:33:57.548 --> 02:34:04.537
make out shapes, vaguely, of things within that
room, but it's rotating as you walk. It takes a

02:34:04.537 --> 02:34:10.813
moment for you all to realize that this chamber,
you're spiraling around it, but there's no change

02:34:10.813 --> 02:34:19.487
to your sense of gravity, but it a corkscrew
movement.

02:34:19.487 --> 02:34:20.865
LAURA: Whoa, that's freaky.

02:34:20.865 --> 02:34:22.193
TRAVIS: (vomiting)

02:34:22.193 --> 02:34:25.514
(laughter)

02:34:25.514 --> 02:34:34.220
MATT: Eventually, you come to the end of the
hallway. Inside it appears to be a warm interior.

02:34:34.220 --> 02:34:39.873
It's a crafted den or study of some kind, but the
angle you're at as you come to the end of it is a

02:34:39.873 --> 02:34:47.084
heavy steep angle. You see all these bookshelves
and a desk across the chamber and there are

02:34:47.084 --> 02:34:52.875
candelabras in there, they're all this harsh
angle, but they're not sliding, they're all held

02:34:52.875 --> 02:34:55.555
in place by something.

02:34:55.555 --> 02:34:56.770
TALIESIN: Or we are.

02:34:56.770 --> 02:34:59.108
LAURA: By gravity!

02:34:59.108 --> 02:35:02.517
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and use Thaumaturgy
through the door to see if I can affect the flame

02:35:02.517 --> 02:35:04.195
before we enter.

02:35:04.195 --> 02:35:07.369
MATT: Okay. You cast Thaumaturgy, no effect.

02:35:07.369 --> 02:35:09.576
TALIESIN: Well, that's weird.

02:35:09.576 --> 02:35:11.636
DEBORAH: It's in front?

02:35:11.636 --> 02:35:13.855
TALIESIN: We're not in there yet.

02:35:13.855 --> 02:35:17.034
DEBORAH: The flames we see are between us.

02:35:17.034 --> 02:35:20.604
MATT: The flames you see are inside the chamber,
and you haven't entered the chamber yet. The

02:35:20.604 --> 02:35:22.247
Thaumaturgy doesn't seem to--

02:35:22.247 --> 02:35:23.898
DEBORAH: But are they in the way of us entering
the chamber?

02:35:23.902 --> 02:35:24.971
MATT: No.

02:35:24.971 --> 02:35:26.027
DEBORAH: Oh, okay.

02:35:26.027 --> 02:35:29.217
TALIESIN: No, I was just curious if the magic
would follow through, apparently not, or whatever

02:35:29.217 --> 02:35:32.202
is in there is not real. I don't know.

02:35:32.202 --> 02:35:34.090
LAURA: Can we see any movement outside the
flames?

02:35:34.090 --> 02:35:35.997
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:35:35.997 --> 02:35:37.929
SAM: Come on, Jessie.

02:35:37.929 --> 02:35:40.513
LAURA: Oh, well, 11, no.

02:35:40.513 --> 02:35:43.461
MATT: No movement beyond just the slow movement of
flames.

02:35:43.461 --> 02:35:46.284
MARISHA: Is there any scripture or writing on
the--?

02:35:46.284 --> 02:35:47.958
MATT: In the interior of the hallway?

02:35:47.958 --> 02:35:49.844
MARISHA: Yeah, to like enter this door.

02:35:49.844 --> 02:35:51.766
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:35:54.349 --> 02:35:56.677
MARISHA: Natural 20.

02:35:56.958 --> 02:36:03.140
MATT: Looking around the edge of the hall, the
ending, you don't see any script or symbols.

02:36:03.140 --> 02:36:08.989
Looking inside the chamber, though, as you get
close and peer within, this is definitely a study

02:36:08.989 --> 02:36:13.770
of some kind. There are bookshelves upon
bookshelves that round different areas. You can

02:36:13.770 --> 02:36:18.788
see a desk on the far end with a chair there. You
don't see anybody in it. Across from where this

02:36:18.788 --> 02:36:25.014
desk is, you get close and push and past Twiggy
and Nott to look inside. This is a tall chamber,

02:36:25.014 --> 02:36:30.920
it's maybe 70 or 60 foot tall. Taller almost than
it is wide. On the opposite end of the desk, above

02:36:30.920 --> 02:36:36.854
this large collection of bookshelves, there is a
heavy stained glass window that's about 30 or 40

02:36:36.854 --> 02:36:41.285
feet tall, and about 40 to 50 feet wide.

02:36:41.285 --> 02:36:44.592
MARISHA: Is there any image in the stained glass?

02:36:44.592 --> 02:36:49.872
MATT: There is no light source behind it. You can
see the stained glass and that there are colors to

02:36:49.872 --> 02:36:54.277
it, but there's nothing behind, no daylight to
really make it clear from this distance. You'd

02:36:54.558 --> 02:36:55.849
have to get closer.

02:36:55.849 --> 02:36:58.116
DEBORAH: Do we see any other exits in this tower,
this chamber?

02:36:58.116 --> 02:37:00.821
MATT: Not from where you're standing. But you guys
still have not entered the chamber.

02:37:00.821 --> 02:37:03.379
LAURA: Should we do it stealthily?

02:37:03.379 --> 02:37:04.922
SAM: Yes.

02:37:04.922 --> 02:37:07.666
MARISHA: I think we're about to enter into
someone's study.

02:37:07.666 --> 02:37:10.070
LAURA: I'm going to case Pass Without a Trace on
all of us.

02:37:10.070 --> 02:37:14.087
MATT: So everyone gets plus ten to their stealth
check. I'd like everyone to roll a stealth check

02:37:14.087 --> 02:37:15.701
for me, please.

02:37:17.810 --> 02:37:19.081
TRAVIS: 21.

02:37:19.081 --> 02:37:21.575
MATT: Beau?

02:37:21.575 --> 02:37:22.773
MARISHA: 34.

02:37:22.773 --> 02:37:23.704
LIAM: 15.

02:37:23.704 --> 02:37:25.461
SAM: 32.

02:37:25.461 --> 02:37:26.530
LAURA: 17.

02:37:26.530 --> 02:37:27.685
DEBORAH: 20.

02:37:27.685 --> 02:37:29.316
TALIESIN: 24.

02:37:29.316 --> 02:37:33.562
MATT: Overall, pretty good stealth scores. You
feel pretty confident that as you one by one enter

02:37:33.562 --> 02:37:40.619
the chamber, bracing yourself to slide down with
the curved floor, and you stumble and trip as you

02:37:40.619 --> 02:37:46.690
enter because, as soon as you step in, your whole
perspective shifts and gravity is as it should be

02:37:46.690 --> 02:37:51.973
in that chamber. You all step in at an odd angle
and have to catch yourself as you have to reorient

02:37:51.973 --> 02:37:54.041
yourself in an instant.

02:37:54.041 --> 02:37:57.365
LIAM: Like stepping off a moving sidewalk at the
airport, but way worse.

02:37:57.365 --> 02:37:58.607
MATT: Yes.

02:37:58.607 --> 02:38:00.558
LAURA: That was a neat trick.

02:38:00.558 --> 02:38:02.496
MATT: As you all step in the chamber, let me get a
visual reference.

02:38:02.496 --> 02:38:04.628
(cheering)

02:38:04.628 --> 02:38:06.529
TALIESIN: So many toys today.

02:38:06.529 --> 02:38:12.545
SAM: The Raven and the Rook is a thing that I
don't have any information about.

02:38:12.545 --> 02:38:15.218
LAURA: They make badass notebooks!

02:38:15.218 --> 02:38:17.772
LIAM: Ring based.

02:38:17.772 --> 02:38:20.280
TALIESIN: Hey, oh!

02:38:20.280 --> 02:38:23.292
(oohing)

02:38:23.292 --> 02:38:25.072
SAM: Look at all those books!

02:38:25.072 --> 02:38:28.222
LAURA: Whoa! There's a ladder, you guys!

02:38:28.222 --> 02:38:29.650
DEBORAH: We like ladders.

02:38:29.650 --> 02:38:31.735
TALIESIN: I love a good ladder.

02:38:31.735 --> 02:38:34.505
MATT: Pushing into this chamber, this door is
already open.

02:38:34.505 --> 02:38:36.451
LAURA: Ooh! A door that works!

02:38:36.451 --> 02:38:43.148
MATT: You guys all step into the interior of this
den of some kind.

02:38:43.148 --> 02:38:46.633
TRAVIS: I'm not looking at your notes, I'm just
looking through the wall.

02:38:46.633 --> 02:38:48.152
MATT: It's fine.

02:38:48.152 --> 02:38:49.819
LAURA: Where's the fireplace? Is it straight
across?

02:38:49.819 --> 02:38:53.709
MATT: There's no fireplace, but there are
candelabras throughout the chamber that give a

02:38:53.709 --> 02:38:57.983
light source that flickers throughout the
interior. This is all bookcases, these are

02:38:57.983 --> 02:39:02.252
bookcases, these are bookcases, these are
bookcases, this is a closed bookcase. There's a

02:39:02.252 --> 02:39:06.765
small desk here and a large desk here and the
stained glass window stands up there.

02:39:06.765 --> 02:39:10.785
LAURA: Those books look like you could remove them
and play with them.

02:39:10.785 --> 02:39:13.128
TRAVIS: Caleb passes out.

02:39:13.128 --> 02:39:15.421
LIAM: Nosebleed.

02:39:16.263 --> 02:39:19.689
TALIESIN: I'm going to try the candelabra again
see if I can get those flames a little brighter.

02:39:19.689 --> 02:39:25.811
MATT: Once you start, all of the flames flicker
brighter causing deeper shadows across the chamber.

02:39:25.811 --> 02:39:28.644
TALIESIN: I'll reel them back in. All right,
that's good to know.

02:39:28.644 --> 02:39:31.232
DEBORAH: You say now we see a door and it's open?

02:39:31.232 --> 02:39:33.343
MATT: That's the door you came through.

02:39:33.343 --> 02:39:35.295
SAM: But there's no other doors in this room?

02:39:35.295 --> 02:39:37.965
MATT: Make a perception check. You guys entered
from that side.

02:39:37.965 --> 02:39:41.180
SAM: I will look for a door. That's cocked. Six.

02:39:41.180 --> 02:39:42.774
LAURA: That wasn't cocked.

02:39:42.774 --> 02:39:45.275
MATT: It looks pretty solid.

02:39:45.275 --> 02:39:47.165
TRAVIS: You say the stained glass window was on
which wall?

02:39:47.165 --> 02:39:48.397
MATT: This wall here.

02:39:48.397 --> 02:39:49.996
TRAVIS: Gotcha. Thank you.

02:39:49.996 --> 02:39:52.986
MATT: There's a ladder over there as well. Looks
like these are all set aside for climbing and

02:39:52.986 --> 02:39:54.632
getting higher.

02:39:54.632 --> 02:39:56.921
TRAVIS: I'll climb up the ladder and get just
under the stained glass window.

02:39:56.921 --> 02:39:58.492
MATT: Okay.

02:39:58.492 --> 02:40:01.331
TRAVIS: Can I see through the glass or at the
glass or is it above me?

02:40:01.331 --> 02:40:06.455
MATT: No, you can see through it. It starts maybe
six inches off where that platform starts and then

02:40:06.455 --> 02:40:16.803
continues up for the next 40 or so feet. Looking
through, it is darkness, void, a lack of light.

02:40:16.803 --> 02:40:21.021
The only color you're able to make out is what the
candlelight from the inside of the chamber is

02:40:21.021 --> 02:40:24.144
enabling you to see from the inside, from this
side.

02:40:24.144 --> 02:40:30.869
TALIESIN: I'm going to maybe throw some
illumination up so we can see the window a bit better.

02:40:31.151 --> 02:40:36.730
MATT: Okay. As you all step into the middle of the
chamber to look at this stained glass window above you--

02:40:36.730 --> 02:40:39.659
LAURA: We should have checked for traps and stuff,
you guys.

02:40:39.659 --> 02:40:44.238
TALIESIN: Yeah. I was going to say, I was actually
thinking about getting up. I would like that, that

02:40:44.238 --> 02:40:46.028
weird corner ladder.

02:40:46.028 --> 02:40:47.106
MATT: Over here?

02:40:47.106 --> 02:40:48.539
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:40:48.539 --> 02:40:50.302
MATT: Sure. You place yourselves where you want to
be.

02:40:50.302 --> 02:40:52.010
TRAVIS: You and your damn loft positions,
Taliesin.

02:40:52.010 --> 02:40:55.454
TALIESIN: I like a good loft position. Since I was
a kid, my favorite thing.

02:40:55.454 --> 02:40:59.768
MATT: As there's more light in the chamber, you
can see now, above this desk there is a

02:40:59.768 --> 02:41:07.163
12-foot-tall, six-foot-wide picture frame. In the
picture frame, from the side angle, it has no

02:41:07.163 --> 02:41:15.330
image. As you step into the center, an image comes
into shape. You see a tall, ten- to 12-foot-tall

02:41:15.330 --> 02:41:23.160
portrait of a man: thin, of light brown skin, long
dark hair that tumbles past his shoulders, a very

02:41:23.160 --> 02:41:26.825
thinly-groomed chin beard that falls to a point
three or four inches below-- it's a very succinct

02:41:26.825 --> 02:41:31.644
point-- wearing a red robe with gold trim.

02:41:32.014 --> 02:41:34.254
LAURA: Does he have a ring on?

02:41:34.519 --> 02:41:40.241
MATT: He is wearing a handful of rings on his
hands. Billowing sleeves folded across his lap.

02:41:40.241 --> 02:41:46.191
His eyes are a piercing amber-yellow color, and
his lip curls ever so slightly into a knowing smile.

02:41:46.191 --> 02:41:49.245
DEBORAH: He doesn't look like Sir Cadigan, does
he?

02:41:49.245 --> 02:41:50.433
MATT: No.

02:41:50.433 --> 02:41:52.866
LAURA: Okay, that's where I was going. What about
a green ring, though? Does he have a green ring?

02:41:52.866 --> 02:41:54.536
TALIESIN: Can we see his feet?

02:41:54.536 --> 02:41:57.291
MATT: No. It's lap up.

02:41:57.291 --> 02:42:00.408
LAURA: Wait, describe him. Say him again.

02:42:00.408 --> 02:42:03.026
SAM: Do all of it again.

02:42:03.026 --> 02:42:07.852
MATT: A tall, thin man of light brown skin, with
long, dark hair that tumbles past his shoulders, a

02:42:07.852 --> 02:42:12.115
very thinly-groomed chin beard that falls to a
point about three inches below his chin, wearing a

02:42:12.414 --> 02:42:16.768
red robe with gold trim, with billowing sleeves
that fold across his lap. His eyes are a piercing

02:42:16.768 --> 02:42:22.124
amber yellow. His lips curl ever so slightly into
a knowing smile. There you go.

02:42:22.371 --> 02:42:23.685
LAURA: And he's got lots of rings on.

02:42:23.685 --> 02:42:25.874
MATT: Yeah, he's got some intricate rings on his
fingers.

02:42:25.874 --> 02:42:28.479
SAM: He's wearing a red robe, you said?

02:42:28.479 --> 02:42:35.901
MATT: Yes. It looks almost the same coloration,
the same deep red, the same gold trim.

02:42:35.901 --> 02:42:38.990
LAURA: Oh look! I bet it's that guy! That's his
robe!

02:42:38.990 --> 02:42:40.003
TRAVIS: What's that?

02:42:40.003 --> 02:42:41.347
LAURA: He's thin.

02:42:41.347 --> 02:42:43.979
TRAVIS: Ah! Ah!

02:42:43.979 --> 02:42:49.129
DEBORAH: Guys, I really want to know what's in the
closed cabinet. Can I go look?

02:42:49.129 --> 02:42:52.710
TALIESIN: I would check for things, but.

02:42:52.710 --> 02:42:54.912
DEBORAH: Should I use my fancy hand again?

02:42:54.912 --> 02:42:58.258
LIAM: I think both of you should be taking a look
around in this moment.

02:42:58.258 --> 02:43:01.097
MATT: While that's happening, the stained glass
window, now that you have light that's

02:43:01.097 --> 02:43:02.683
illuminating it--

02:43:02.683 --> 02:43:03.954
MARISHA: Oh shit.

02:43:04.211 --> 02:43:09.803
MATT: There is no backlight, so it's just the
light that you have on it right there. It shows

02:43:09.803 --> 02:43:16.623
clusters of different colored circles and discs
arranged in a strange, tethered pattern. You see

02:43:16.770 --> 02:43:20.860
different colored discs, different sizes and
colorations, that are laid into this with

02:43:20.860 --> 02:43:28.286
fragments of dark blues and grays in between. They
are all tethered by these silver threads and

02:43:28.286 --> 02:43:38.568
various tangled-- it looks like a crazed
synesthesia equation, if you will. Anybody who's

02:43:38.568 --> 02:43:40.995
trained in arcana or history, go ahead and roll.

02:43:40.995 --> 02:43:43.113
TRAVIS: Okay then.

02:43:43.113 --> 02:43:44.889
LIAM: The worst roll.

02:43:44.889 --> 02:43:47.325
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil.

02:43:49.105 --> 02:43:50.212
TRAVIS: 15.

02:43:52.139 --> 02:43:53.686
MARISHA: 15.

02:43:53.887 --> 02:44:01.687
MATT: Okay. This arrangement, you begin to make
out, is a layout of the planes, the transitive

02:44:01.687 --> 02:44:06.699
planes of the Ethereal and the Astral between the
realms. You see these clouds of gray and light

02:44:06.699 --> 02:44:13.422
blue that mingle and create a Venn diagram where
everything overlaps on top of. They act as the

02:44:13.422 --> 02:44:19.642
threads that hold these things together and
connect them in between. The inner planes showing

02:44:19.642 --> 02:44:24.127
the elemental chaos where the primordial elements
were ordered into following the Founding of

02:44:24.127 --> 02:44:30.839
Exandria. You can see where the flaming sphere is
placed here, and there is the water, and the wind,

02:44:30.839 --> 02:44:34.234
and the earth. That is the scattering of these
inner planes.

02:44:34.234 --> 02:44:36.515
DEBORAH: Is there a You Are Here sticker?

02:44:36.515 --> 02:44:38.155
TRAVIS: Yeah!

02:44:38.155 --> 02:44:40.329
MARISHA: That's actually, yes.

02:44:40.329 --> 02:44:45.090
MATT: The outer planes, where the realms where the
divine exist, are scattered and connected, all

02:44:45.090 --> 02:44:50.138
surrounding the Material Plane on the outer side.
What you both notice, two things are off about

02:44:50.138 --> 02:44:58.283
this. One, there's no Divine Gate shown here. In
this whole layout, there is no reference. Most

02:44:58.283 --> 02:45:06.380
maps or sketches or historical designs of this
type of a layout contains the Divine Gate because

02:45:06.380 --> 02:45:10.710
that was a major event that happened after the
Calamity and separated all of the gods from the

02:45:10.710 --> 02:45:11.836
mortal planes.

02:45:11.836 --> 02:45:13.309
LIAM and LAURA: This is old.

02:45:13.309 --> 02:45:15.423
LIAM: Old, just like the device.

02:45:15.423 --> 02:45:23.106
MATT: You get the sense this was designed before
the Divine Gate was ever created. Number two,

02:45:23.106 --> 02:45:28.995
there is an additional shape. Smaller than the
rest. A tiny, ruby-like circle that floats in the

02:45:28.995 --> 02:45:35.828
Astral Sea, that is not tethered to anything, and
seems to not really fit within your understanding

02:45:35.828 --> 02:45:37.884
of the cosmos.

02:45:39.424 --> 02:45:41.259
TRAVIS: A small ruby circle?

02:45:41.259 --> 02:45:44.743
MATT: Like the same color. Like the color of a
ruby.

02:45:45.085 --> 02:45:47.267
SAM: A ruby in the Astral Sea?

02:45:47.267 --> 02:45:49.943
MATT and LAURA: Aww.

02:45:49.943 --> 02:45:52.880
TRAVIS: Does it blink, shine, shimmer, move?

02:45:52.880 --> 02:45:56.688
MATT: No, it's just the same type of material as
everything else. It's the glass the window's made

02:45:56.688 --> 02:45:58.103
out of.

02:45:58.103 --> 02:46:04.447
MARISHA: And where is that amongst the planes, the
little ruby amongst the sea? Is it in between two

02:46:04.447 --> 02:46:06.278
certain certain planes?

02:46:06.278 --> 02:46:09.252
MATT: It looks like it's sitting in the center of
the Astral Sea, and doesn't have any tethers.

02:46:09.252 --> 02:46:12.762
Everything else seems to be tethered by these
silver cords, almost, that puts in this large

02:46:12.762 --> 02:46:17.100
tapestry. And that is just floating between all
the lines in the middle of the Astral Sea.

02:46:17.100 --> 02:46:19.749
TRAVIS: Confused by its location, I'm gonna
touch it.

02:46:19.749 --> 02:46:20.604
MATT: You touch it?

02:46:20.604 --> 02:46:21.506
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:46:21.506 --> 02:46:22.513
DEBORAH: Yes!

02:46:22.513 --> 02:46:23.297
MARISHA: Oh shit.

02:46:23.297 --> 02:46:28.429
MATT: You touch it, and all of you hear this loud,
heavy shattering sound as the window shatters into

02:46:28.429 --> 02:46:33.725
a hundred different pieces, all of them stopping
about three feet from the window and freezing in

02:46:33.725 --> 02:46:40.908
place. Fjord, standing before it in this void gets
sucked into the darkness and the glass window

02:46:40.908 --> 02:46:42.979
closes behind him.

02:46:43.142 --> 02:46:44.016
MARISHA: What?!

02:46:44.016 --> 02:46:45.460
SAM: Ah! What did he touch?!

02:46:45.460 --> 02:46:46.707
MARISHA: Are you serious?!

02:46:46.707 --> 02:46:47.951
DEBORAH: He touched the--

02:46:47.951 --> 02:46:49.861
MATT: No, no one technically was watching.

02:46:49.861 --> 02:46:52.565
LIAM: The red bubble? This is some labyrinth shit,
motherfucker.

02:46:52.565 --> 02:46:54.570
LAURA: What just happened? Where did Fjord just
go?

02:46:54.570 --> 02:46:56.564
SAM: (yelling) Fjord! No!

02:46:56.564 --> 02:46:58.616
MARISHA: Why does this keep happening to you?

02:46:58.616 --> 02:47:00.487
TRAVIS: Because I do stupid shit!

02:47:00.487 --> 02:47:04.902
MATT: So what are you guys doing? We'll get to you
later.

02:47:04.902 --> 02:47:07.271
DEBORAH: We were on the way to the cabinet--

02:47:07.271 --> 02:47:11.397
TRAVIS: Why does he got to describe it and make it
sound so interesting?

02:47:11.397 --> 02:47:13.642
SAM: How can you focus on the cabinet right now?!

02:47:13.642 --> 02:47:15.586
DEBORAH: Because maybe it'll tell us where he
went!

02:47:15.586 --> 02:47:18.665
SAM: Okay, you're right. There might be
information in there. Let's go look at the cabinet.

02:47:18.805 --> 02:47:20.357
DEBORAH: We're going to the cabinet.

02:47:20.357 --> 02:47:24.305
SAM: I will support you and help you and aid you,
but judgmentally.

02:47:26.402 --> 02:47:28.998
LAURA: I'm going to run up where Fjord
disappeared.

02:47:28.998 --> 02:47:32.380
MARISHA: I was actually technically watching from
downstairs.

02:47:32.380 --> 02:47:39.360
MATT: You guys notice him vanish. There's no like,
where did Fjord go? You heard the wall explode and

02:47:39.360 --> 02:47:41.845
him disappear and then it reset itself and
closed.

02:47:41.845 --> 02:47:43.326
SAM: No one else touch it!

02:47:43.326 --> 02:47:45.809
TALIESIN: Okay, let's all just be very careful
before we do anything.

02:47:45.809 --> 02:47:47.607
DEBORAH: I like his style!

02:47:47.607 --> 02:47:51.017
LIAM: I know a lot of people are doing a lot of
things, but eventually get to me, I'm going to

02:47:51.017 --> 02:47:54.420
start ransacking the desk for notes about that.

02:47:54.420 --> 02:47:58.827
MATT: Okay. Caleb's heading over to the desk. As
you're walking by, Caleb, there are books and

02:47:58.827 --> 02:48:06.733
books on these shelves, and you notice that all of
the books have a brass binding around them, like a

02:48:06.733 --> 02:48:12.363
lock. Like a square shaped manacle that is affixed
around it, and it looks like all of them are

02:48:12.363 --> 02:48:18.688
locked in some way. There might be ways to open
it, but it looks like whoever left this alone did

02:48:18.688 --> 02:48:21.645
not intend for anyone to open it but them.

02:48:21.645 --> 02:48:24.401
LAURA: That looks like an open book at the end of
the room, Caleb.

02:48:24.401 --> 02:48:26.349
LIAM: I'm looking for a way to help Fjord right
now.

02:48:26.349 --> 02:48:31.640
MATT: You guys are over at the opposite end of
this closed thing. This also has a brass bar that

02:48:31.640 --> 02:48:35.007
is bolted and affixed to the closed cabinet.

02:48:35.007 --> 02:48:36.579
DEBORAH: Want to take it?

02:48:36.579 --> 02:48:37.962
SAM: Unlock it? Yes.

02:48:37.962 --> 02:48:39.079
DEBORAH: You want me to do it?

02:48:39.079 --> 02:48:40.343
SAM: Yes, I will aid you.

02:48:40.343 --> 02:48:42.154
DEBORAH: Okay, so I'm thieves' tooling on it.

02:48:42.154 --> 02:48:44.141
MATT: All right, so make an attempt with
advantage.

02:48:44.892 --> 02:48:46.155
DEBORAH: 27.

02:48:46.155 --> 02:48:53.769
MATT: You manage to find an area underneath the
bar where there's a button press or symbol, and

02:48:53.769 --> 02:48:58.167
you get one of the tools underneath, push it
inside, and turn. As you do, the bar (click).

02:48:58.167 --> 02:49:04.081
DEBORAH: While Twiggy does this, she sticks her
tongue out the side of her mouth and one eye closed.

02:49:04.816 --> 02:49:06.996
MATT: It appears to be unlocked.

02:49:07.338 --> 02:49:08.557
DEBORAH: Okay.

02:49:08.557 --> 02:49:10.385
SAM: Let's open it.

02:49:10.385 --> 02:49:12.941
DEBORAH: We both take each one and open up the
cabinet.

02:49:12.941 --> 02:49:17.387
MATT: Okay, you open the inside of the cabinet,
and it is empty.

02:49:17.387 --> 02:49:19.410
DEBORAH: I don't buy it.

02:49:19.410 --> 02:49:21.591
SAM: Let's feel around, wiggle around.

02:49:21.591 --> 02:49:23.278
DEBORAH: We stick our hands in.

02:49:23.278 --> 02:49:31.620
MATT: Okay! You put your hands inside the empty
cabinet, and it immediately closes on your arms as

02:49:31.620 --> 02:49:35.093
teeth suddenly emerge from the sides of the door.

02:49:35.093 --> 02:49:37.345
(yelling, groaning)

02:49:37.345 --> 02:49:38.615
MARISHA: Shut up!

02:49:38.615 --> 02:49:45.570
MATT: No, actually, this is an attack on each of
you. Oh, that's cocked. Okay, that is 23 against you.

02:49:45.711 --> 02:49:47.425
DEBORAH: Okay.

02:49:47.425 --> 02:49:49.833
MATT: And that is 17 against you.

02:49:49.833 --> 02:49:51.220
SAM: Hits.

02:49:51.220 --> 02:50:00.767
MATT: All right. Each of you suffer 14 points of
piercing damage.

02:50:00.767 --> 02:50:01.980
SAM: Uncanny dodge.

02:50:01.980 --> 02:50:03.463
DEBORAH: Yeah, uncanny dodge.

02:50:03.463 --> 02:50:07.177
MATT: Both of you take seven points of piercing
damage, but you are both currently grappled as it

02:50:07.177 --> 02:50:13.185
is slammed on your arms in a very The Thing kind
of way, like when the guy's chest opens and

02:50:13.185 --> 02:50:18.368
closes. Yeah, it's some John Carpenter. It closes
on you and you see on each of the doors where the

02:50:18.368 --> 02:50:25.140
striations of the wood are, they split and you see
these eyes peek through at you.

02:50:25.140 --> 02:50:28.576
LAURA: I immediately turn around and Invoke
Duplicity down on the ground near them.

02:50:28.576 --> 02:50:31.580
MATT: Okay. All right, that Invoke Duplicity
appears. Where do you want her to be?

02:50:31.580 --> 02:50:33.622
LAURA: Right next to them.

02:50:33.622 --> 02:50:35.331
MATT: Okay, yeah, so you guys are both up here
right now.

02:50:35.331 --> 02:50:36.419
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

02:50:36.419 --> 02:50:38.230
TALIESIN: For Pete's-- Sacred Flame.

02:50:38.230 --> 02:50:40.743
MATT: All right, I need you guys to roll
initiative.

02:50:40.743 --> 02:50:42.379
SAM: Oh, boy.

02:50:42.379 --> 02:50:43.965
TRAVIS: What about me, Matt?

02:50:43.965 --> 02:50:45.999
MATT: Nope!

02:50:46.478 --> 02:50:49.380
TRAVIS: I'm going to do it! 19.

02:50:50.280 --> 02:50:52.189
MATT: Okay, so, 25 to 20?

02:50:54.331 --> 02:50:55.363
20 to 15?

02:50:55.363 --> 02:50:56.504
DEBORAH: 17.

02:50:56.504 --> 02:50:57.946
SAM: Hey!

02:50:57.946 --> 02:50:59.566
MATT: All righty.

02:51:00.426 --> 02:51:02.312
SAM and MARISHA: Marishative.

02:51:02.312 --> 02:51:04.461
SAM: Roll for Marishative.

02:51:04.533 --> 02:51:06.446
MATT: There you go. 15 to ten?

02:51:06.446 --> 02:51:06.996
MARISHA: 11.

02:51:06.996 --> 02:51:09.822
SAM: 12. Whoa, you guys.

02:51:09.822 --> 02:51:12.463
MATT: Beau is going at the same time as the
cabinet.

02:51:12.463 --> 02:51:16.262
MARISHA: "Beau is going at the same time as the
cabinet."

02:51:16.262 --> 02:51:25.718
MATT: I love saying that. That's an actual phrase
that exists. I'm so happy. Ten to five?

02:51:25.718 --> 02:51:29.079
LAURA: Five, but I rolled a natural one.

02:51:29.079 --> 02:51:30.099
LIAM: Six.

02:51:30.099 --> 02:51:34.921
MATT: Okay, got you. Caduceus?

02:51:34.995 --> 02:51:36.357
TALIESIN: Three.

02:51:36.357 --> 02:51:37.244
MATT: All right.

02:51:37.244 --> 02:51:39.402
TALIESIN: There's a long sigh at the beginning of
the round.

02:51:39.402 --> 02:51:41.167
MATT: Twiggy, you're up first.

02:51:41.167 --> 02:51:46.709
DEBORAH: I'm up first. First, I would like to, if
possible, try to extricate my hands from this. Is

02:51:46.709 --> 02:51:47.699
it possible?

02:51:47.699 --> 02:51:50.828
MATT: It is. You have to use an action to try and
escape with an ability check. You can choose

02:51:50.828 --> 02:51:52.609
either acrobatics or athletics.

02:51:52.609 --> 02:51:57.414
DEBORAH: Acrobatics! That is a 19.

02:51:57.414 --> 02:52:00.798
MATT: 19 is enough! You manage to wedge your
arm--

02:52:00.798 --> 02:52:02.294
DEBORAH: I put my foot up!

02:52:02.294 --> 02:52:05.134
MATT: -- and pull out, and, yeah, you manage to
free yourself from its grasp.

02:52:05.134 --> 02:52:10.985
DEBORAH: Cool. Using my bonus action, I want to
disengage from it and back up a little bit.

02:52:10.985 --> 02:52:14.976
MATT: Okay, easy enough. You manage to back up to
there.

02:52:14.976 --> 02:52:15.918
DEBORAH: Yeah.

02:52:15.918 --> 02:52:17.737
MATT: That finishes your go. Nott, you're up
next.

02:52:17.737 --> 02:52:19.558
SAM: Same exact move.

02:52:19.558 --> 02:52:22.856
MATT: Two peas in a pod over here.

02:52:22.856 --> 02:52:26.295
SAM: Yes, that's a 23.

02:52:26.295 --> 02:52:31.057
MATT: You manage to pull yourself free of it as
well and back up to this side.

02:52:31.057 --> 02:52:34.166
SAM: Bonus action disengage!

02:52:34.166 --> 02:52:36.036
MATT: And pull away, no worries.

02:52:36.036 --> 02:52:38.117
DEBORAH: I put up my arm and I go: Twinsies!

02:52:38.117 --> 02:52:41.926
SAM: Ow! So much blood.

02:52:41.926 --> 02:52:45.670
MATT: That finishes your go. Beau and the cabinet
go at the same time. Your dexterity is higher than

02:52:45.670 --> 02:52:49.660
the cabinet's so you go first. It's a cabinet.

02:52:49.660 --> 02:52:51.613
SAM: Hey, that's great. It's got four legs.

02:52:51.613 --> 02:52:55.614
MARISHA: Man, some days you lose, some days you
beat a cabinet.

02:52:55.614 --> 02:52:58.417
(laughter)

02:52:58.417 --> 02:53:01.356
MATT: (singing) Levitz pained! (spoken) What are
you doing?

02:53:01.356 --> 02:53:07.864
MARISHA: I look over and I go: They're fine, and I
go upstairs with Jester.

02:53:07.864 --> 02:53:12.126
TRAVIS: You're not going to whale on this cabinet,
bro?

02:53:12.126 --> 02:53:15.164
MARISHA: Nope. I don't give a fuck right now about
that cabinet.

02:53:15.164 --> 02:53:17.621
MATT: All right, the cabinet--

02:53:17.621 --> 02:53:21.551
MARISHA: Oh, it moves? Now I care a little.

02:53:21.551 --> 02:53:29.293
MATT: Yeah, this is full on, we're talking dark
side of Beauty and the Beast here. Just making its

02:53:29.293 --> 02:53:36.691
way forward. It does notice it's an illusion. It
just steps through it.

02:53:36.691 --> 02:53:40.041
SAM: That's a perceptive cabinet.

02:53:40.041 --> 02:53:41.590
DEBORAH: It is!

02:53:41.590 --> 02:53:52.535
MATT: It moves through and it's going to attempt
to bite. It can bite whoever is adjacent in front

02:53:52.535 --> 02:53:57.272
of it. As you guys move back, it's going to try
and open and try and swallow you up into it.

02:53:57.272 --> 02:53:58.005
DEBORAH: All right.

02:53:58.005 --> 02:54:04.603
MATT: It's going to attempt to lean forward and
pull you into the cabinet's mouth. Against you,

02:54:04.603 --> 02:54:08.700
Nott, that is-- Ooh, that's a 12. I don't think
that hits.

02:54:08.700 --> 02:54:09.675
SAM: Do I roll against that?

02:54:09.675 --> 02:54:10.677
MATT: No, it's just a hit.

02:54:10.677 --> 02:54:12.045
SAM: Oh, does not hit.

02:54:12.045 --> 02:54:14.167
MATT: Yep. And against you, natural 18.

02:54:14.167 --> 02:54:15.176
DEBORAH: Oh, yeah, you hit.

02:54:15.176 --> 02:54:17.297
MATT: Yeah, all right, so you suffer--

02:54:17.297 --> 02:54:24.792
DEBORAH: Now, did that first uncanny dodge count
as my reaction, or can I use it now?

02:54:24.792 --> 02:54:27.733
MATT: You've had your turn since, so you have your
reaction back.

02:54:27.733 --> 02:54:29.115
DEBORAH: So I can halve it now.

02:54:29.115 --> 02:54:32.546
MATT: Yes, you can. So it would be 16 points of
piercing damage, which is reduced to eight;

02:54:32.546 --> 02:54:35.302
however, you are swallowed.

02:54:35.302 --> 02:54:36.986
LIAM: Oh, she's in it!

02:54:36.986 --> 02:54:43.929
MATT: So you're inside of it now. It scoops you
up. It lowers down and slams the cabinet shut as

02:54:44.009 --> 02:54:50.607
it pulls back. Twiggy's legs are kicking there,
and like Audrey 2, it just sucks her inside of the cabinet.

02:54:50.607 --> 02:54:53.438
DEBORAH: I'll never stop loving you!

02:54:53.438 --> 02:54:56.250
SAM: It's okay, she's lived in a box for like a
week.

02:54:56.250 --> 02:54:58.750
MATT: She's used to this! Caleb, you're up.

02:54:58.750 --> 02:55:05.535
LIAM: I am going to trust my friends to take care
of the monster. I have a feeling about the desk.

02:55:05.535 --> 02:55:10.406
This is what I would do. I would think that there
might be something in this man's desk, so I start

02:55:10.406 --> 02:55:11.937
looking for anything of use.

02:55:11.937 --> 02:55:13.368
MATT: Make an investigation check.

02:55:13.368 --> 02:55:14.627
SAM: The desk is a mimic.

02:55:14.627 --> 02:55:16.366
LIAM: It is a 16.

02:55:16.366 --> 02:55:24.355
MATT: Taking a minute to glance through, a couple
of things. One, you pull open one of the drawers.

02:55:24.355 --> 02:55:33.743
You see a glass jar about this big that contains
about a hundred or so of these small glass beads.

02:55:33.743 --> 02:55:41.036
There's that. You go, "Okay, that's that." On the
desk itself, there's a large vial of ink, about

02:55:41.036 --> 02:55:46.860
that big. It's a heavy vial of ink with this big
red quill placed next to it into a little cap.

02:55:46.860 --> 02:55:50.999
TRAVIS: May be Taliesin's.

02:55:50.999 --> 02:55:54.496
TALIESIN: This is a death trap. This is a fucking
death trap.

02:55:54.496 --> 02:56:01.728
MATT: The cork that has been removed from the ink
vial is laid there next to it on the table. You

02:56:01.808 --> 02:56:12.539
see, in another cabinet, a small porcelain doll.
It's made of porcelain and silk. It's crafted to

02:56:12.539 --> 02:56:17.339
look like a young woman in a very fine blue and
black silk dress. The hair is long and silver, and

02:56:17.339 --> 02:56:20.637
the hair in particular is very realistic.

02:56:20.637 --> 02:56:22.338
DEBORAH: Too much detail.

02:56:22.338 --> 02:56:24.475
LAURA: Voodoo doll.

02:56:24.475 --> 02:56:27.434
TRAVIS: I love it when the DM describes something
as too realistic.

02:56:27.434 --> 02:56:28.428
MATT: That's all you find in the desk.

02:56:28.428 --> 02:56:36.664
LIAM: Okay, so then what I do is think: All these
things can kill me. I back away from the desk. I'm

02:56:36.664 --> 02:56:41.978
going to move as far as I can away from the
dresser, along this way.

02:56:41.978 --> 02:56:42.914
MATT: That'll put you there.

02:56:42.914 --> 02:56:43.933
LIAM: No, I'm sorry, I meant--

02:56:43.933 --> 02:56:49.169
MATT: I'm saying you're at the desk to search it.
So that's (counting) 30, which puts you there.

02:56:49.169 --> 02:56:50.603
LIAM: Exactly, so yeah.

02:56:50.603 --> 02:56:51.550
MATT: That finishes your go, Caleb?

02:56:51.550 --> 02:56:52.243
LIAM: That's it.

02:56:52.243 --> 02:56:53.765
MATT: Jester, you're up.

02:56:53.765 --> 02:57:00.620
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to turn around with my
duplicate, and I'm going to cast Inflict Wounds on

02:57:00.620 --> 02:57:02.155
the cabinet.

02:57:02.155 --> 02:57:03.411
MATT: Go for it.

02:57:03.411 --> 02:57:04.675
LAURA: Can you do that?

02:57:04.675 --> 02:57:05.627
MATT: Yeah, you can.

02:57:05.627 --> 02:57:08.230
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to do that at 2nd-level.

02:57:08.230 --> 02:57:10.746
MATT: Second level, so is that 4d10 damage?

02:57:10.746 --> 02:57:12.665
LAURA: Yeah, that's 4d10.

02:57:12.665 --> 02:57:17.238
MATT: Roll to hit first. You have to roll a d20
and then add your spell attack.

02:57:17.238 --> 02:57:18.610
SAM: Side of a barn door, right?

02:57:18.610 --> 02:57:20.866
MATT: Yes, not hard to hit. It's a cabinet.

02:57:20.866 --> 02:57:21.815
LAURA: 17.

02:57:21.815 --> 02:57:29.739
MATT: 17 definitely hits. Roll damage. Since your
illusion is immaterial-- go ahead?

02:57:29.739 --> 02:57:33.104
TRAVIS: Would the cabinet have a French accent
when it talked?

02:57:33.104 --> 02:57:34.424
MATT: You'll find out.

02:57:34.424 --> 02:57:36.414
DEBORAH: Be our guest.

02:57:36.414 --> 02:57:39.676
MATT: Hon hon hon, nom nom nom, I love me some
gnome flesh!

02:57:39.676 --> 02:57:40.952
TRAVIS: I have been here for so long.

02:57:40.952 --> 02:57:42.170
DEBORAH: Nom nom nom.

02:57:42.170 --> 02:57:43.413
LAURA: 20 points.

02:57:43.413 --> 02:57:44.798
MATT: 20 points of damage.

02:57:44.798 --> 02:57:45.852
LAURA: Yes.

02:57:45.852 --> 02:57:48.862
DEBORAH: I have not eaten since the Calamity.

02:57:48.862 --> 02:57:52.425
(laughter)

02:57:52.425 --> 02:57:58.674
MATT: The burst of necrotic energy slams into it,
and the cabinet shakes in place. The eyes roll in

02:57:58.674 --> 02:58:04.425
pain for a second, and they withdraw into the wood
before they pop out once more from the doorways.

02:58:04.425 --> 02:58:12.538
It seems to chew for a second in anger, but it
looks hurt. It's not bloodied, but that was a

02:58:12.538 --> 02:58:15.031
hefty hit. Not bad.

02:58:15.031 --> 02:58:21.857
MARISHA: While she was doing that, I was like: I
feel like I saw him look over here somewhere. So

02:58:21.857 --> 02:58:23.411
over here, yeah.

02:58:23.411 --> 02:58:25.798
LAURA: Yeah, I'm paying attention to her and going
(vague noise).

02:58:25.798 --> 02:58:28.267
MATT: That finishes Jester's go? Caduceus, you're
up.

02:58:28.267 --> 02:58:35.974
TALIESIN: I'm going to hit it with Sacred Flame.

02:58:35.974 --> 02:58:38.914
MATT: I got caught up in it.

02:58:38.914 --> 02:58:40.815
TALIESIN: Going to hit this guy with a Sacred
Flame.

02:58:40.815 --> 02:58:42.321
MATT: Sacred Flame is a dexterity saving throw?

02:58:42.321 --> 02:58:43.972
TALIESIN: Yep, dexterity saving throw.

02:58:43.972 --> 02:58:46.676
MATT: Nope! It's not very fast, this cabinet.

02:58:46.676 --> 02:58:53.047
TALIESIN: Nah, I didn't think it would be. That's
not bad; that's 14 points of damage.

02:58:53.047 --> 02:58:58.667
MATT: 14 points of damage. You watch this burst of
divine energy around it with this faint aqua glow

02:58:58.667 --> 02:59:03.231
to it as it burns around it. The area where it
hits, you see the wood darken and splinter. Its

02:59:03.231 --> 02:59:07.174
boxlike shape is beginning to warp and twist a
little bit as it's starting to give up a little

02:59:07.174 --> 02:59:11.042
bit of its instinctual form. Now it's looking
hurt.

02:59:11.042 --> 02:59:14.225
TALIESIN: Spit it out! Come on!

02:59:14.225 --> 02:59:15.874
MATT: That finishes your go?

02:59:15.874 --> 02:59:17.238
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:59:17.238 --> 02:59:20.608
MATT: Twiggy. Top of your turn. First things
first, it's digesting you.

02:59:20.608 --> 02:59:22.137
DEBORAH: Cool.

02:59:22.137 --> 02:59:29.607
MATT: You take, ooh, that's 15 points of acid
damage. You are inside of it, still.

02:59:29.607 --> 02:59:31.862
DEBORAH: Cool. I'm inside?

02:59:31.862 --> 02:59:34.847
LIAM: Fava beans.

02:59:34.847 --> 02:59:40.749
DEBORAH: Because I have an ally within five feet,
can I attack it from the inside using sneak attack?

02:59:40.955 --> 02:59:47.551
MATT: I'd allow it. There's few places as exposed
and vulnerable as the inside of its mouth!

02:59:47.551 --> 02:59:51.746
DEBORAH: Yeah, I'm going to hang out for a minute
and attack it from the inside.

02:59:51.746 --> 02:59:55.940
MATT: Okay. You are restrained, so it's
disadvantage on the attack, but it is also the

02:59:55.940 --> 02:59:58.649
inside of its mouth, so try it out.

02:59:58.649 --> 03:00:07.489
DEBORAH: Let's do it because it's fun.
Disadvantage is an 18 plus seven, so I think

03:00:07.489 --> 03:00:10.128
that's pretty good.

03:00:10.128 --> 03:00:12.374
LIAM: Deborah, can you be here every week?

03:00:12.374 --> 03:00:22.247
DEBORAH: That's a nine from my initial hit,
piercing. Then with my sneak attack, another four

03:00:22.247 --> 03:00:26.488
and six, so another ten. 19 total.

03:00:26.488 --> 03:00:31.308
MATT: 19 points of damage from the inside as you
jam the dagger up into the top of the cabinet.

03:00:31.308 --> 03:00:36.624
It's a combination of wood striation and weird
liquid muscle that are pushing against you as it's

03:00:36.624 --> 03:00:44.502
digesting you. You jam upward where you imagine
the head might be. As you do, you hear (groaning)

03:00:44.502 --> 03:00:47.761
from the inside. It begins shifting and quaking,
and the muscles are beginning to spasm. It needs

03:00:47.761 --> 03:00:53.620
to make a constitution saving throw, which it
fails and spits you out. You are prone on the

03:00:53.620 --> 03:00:56.495
ground adjacent it. But it does like, (throwing
up).

03:00:56.495 --> 03:00:58.565
DEBORAH: What does the digestive juices look
like?

03:00:58.565 --> 03:01:04.755
MATT: It is a coating of semi-translucent film
with a very faint green texture to it. But it

03:01:04.755 --> 03:01:06.743
mostly looks like spittle, a very thick spittle.

03:01:06.743 --> 03:01:07.559
DEBORAH: And I'm covered in it.

03:01:07.559 --> 03:01:10.428
MATT: You're covered in it. We're talking
Ghostbusters slimer hit covered.

03:01:10.428 --> 03:01:14.873
DEBORAH: As I'm lying on the ground, I wipe it off
the front of my face and throw it on the ground

03:01:14.873 --> 03:01:16.989
and growl at the cabinet.

03:01:16.989 --> 03:01:18.375
MATT: You still have movement.

03:01:18.375 --> 03:01:22.193
DEBORAH: I do have movement. As a bonus action, I
can disengage.

03:01:22.193 --> 03:01:27.064
MATT: You can. Half your movement to get prone, if
you want to, unless you want to crawl.

03:01:27.064 --> 03:01:30.187
DEBORAH: I think I want to crawl. Am I halved if I
crawl?

03:01:30.187 --> 03:01:31.491
MATT: Yeah.

03:01:31.491 --> 03:01:33.247
DEBORAH: But I'm halved if I stand up anyway.

03:01:33.247 --> 03:01:34.811
MATT: Yeah, your call.

03:01:34.811 --> 03:01:40.621
DEBORAH: I'm going to crawl. I'm going to go back
half, so 15 feet.

03:01:40.621 --> 03:01:42.186
MATT: You can get under the table if you want.

03:01:42.186 --> 03:01:44.936
DEBORAH: Yeah, I'm going to go 15 feet back under
the table. I can't hide, but I'm going to get

03:01:44.936 --> 03:01:46.763
under there because it's not that smart.

03:01:46.763 --> 03:01:48.938
MATT: You leave this little trail on the ground as
you get under the table.

03:01:48.938 --> 03:01:50.442
DEBORAH: Yeah, slug slime.

03:01:50.442 --> 03:01:52.563
MATT: You got it. Nott, you're up first.

03:01:52.563 --> 03:01:54.759
SAM: Is Jester's duplicate considered--?

03:01:54.759 --> 03:01:56.581
MATT: It does not count as an ally.

03:01:56.581 --> 03:02:03.386
SAM: Okay. Well then, I will bonus action-- shit.
I won't bonus action. I will move away from it.

03:02:03.386 --> 03:02:07.566
MATT: Okay, you step away. It takes an attack of
opportunity with you. It's going to attempt to

03:02:07.566 --> 03:02:11.903
bite at you and consume you. That is a 15 to hit.
What's your armor class?

03:02:11.903 --> 03:02:12.653
SAM: 16.

03:02:12.653 --> 03:02:17.870
MATT: You just manage to duck out of the way as it
slams shut inches from your body.

03:02:17.870 --> 03:02:22.381
SAM: Okay. I'll skitter behind near that
candelabra and bonus action hide.

03:02:22.381 --> 03:02:26.192
MATT: You are going to attempt to hide over here
or over here?

03:02:26.192 --> 03:02:27.442
SAM: Well, I was going over--

03:02:27.442 --> 03:02:29.877
MATT: Oh, this way. You manage to bonus action
hide. All right, roll a stealth check.

03:02:29.877 --> 03:02:33.306
SAM: Okay. 19 plus a million. So it's a--

03:02:33.306 --> 03:02:35.067
MATT: You feel pretty stealthy.

03:02:35.067 --> 03:02:39.699
SAM: 29, yeah. I think we still have Pass without
Trace. 39.

03:02:39.699 --> 03:02:42.764
MATT: You feel pretty hidden. Just throwing it out
there.

03:02:42.764 --> 03:02:46.559
SAM: Then I will attack from my hidden position.

03:02:46.559 --> 03:02:48.376
MATT: All right, so you move back out.

03:02:48.376 --> 03:02:52.135
LAURA: You actually I don't think have Pass
without Trace because I Invoked Duplicity, but whatever.

03:02:52.215 --> 03:02:54.122
MATT: Oh, that's right, yeah. It's fine; he's
still hidden.

03:02:54.122 --> 03:02:56.752
SAM: Okay, so that is a 24 to hit.

03:02:56.752 --> 03:02:58.575
MATT: You do have advantage on the attack since it
did not see you.

03:02:58.575 --> 03:03:00.584
SAM: Still 24 to hit.

03:03:00.584 --> 03:03:01.964
MATT: Yeah, all right.

03:03:01.964 --> 03:03:20.766
SAM: Let's see here. (counting) That's 21, plus
I'll use Fury of the Small. That's 28. I was going

03:03:20.766 --> 03:03:28.379
to use one of my explosive arrows, but I have
three, and one of them doesn't work. So I don't

03:03:28.379 --> 03:03:29.811
know which one I drew.

03:03:29.811 --> 03:03:33.759
MATT: Roll a d6. On a one or a two, it's the
defunct one.

03:03:34.113 --> 03:03:35.630
SAM: It's a two!

03:03:35.630 --> 03:03:37.951
MATT: Perfect! Well, regardless, how do you want
to do this?

03:03:37.951 --> 03:03:50.714
SAM: Where do I shoot on a cabinet? I'll wait till
the doors are just a little open and try to thread

03:03:50.714 --> 03:03:53.951
the needle and jam it right through its mouth
heart.

03:03:53.951 --> 03:04:01.394
MATT: As it vanishes into its mouth heart, the
cabinet closes shut. The eyes go wide for a

03:04:01.394 --> 03:04:05.892
second, and you are waiting for the explosion
like, (straining).

03:04:05.892 --> 03:04:07.475
SAM: It's filled with pepper.

03:04:07.475 --> 03:04:15.580
MATT: Yeah. It goes (sneezing) and starts sneezing
heavily. As it's sneezing, the wounds that it's

03:04:15.580 --> 03:04:21.640
taken are causing it to sneeze up its blood. It is
leaving puddles on the ground, until eventually

03:04:21.640 --> 03:04:25.768
the eyes roll back and it falls on the ground.

03:04:25.768 --> 03:04:28.035
LIAM: That cabinet had a mother!

03:04:28.035 --> 03:04:31.501
LAURA: That was pretty gross, straight through.

03:04:31.501 --> 03:04:37.391
TALIESIN: Let's all maybe be a little more careful
about the--

03:04:37.391 --> 03:04:38.823
LIAM: Fjord, Fjord.

03:04:38.823 --> 03:04:39.771
MARISHA: He's gone.

03:04:39.771 --> 03:04:42.695
LIAM: Yeah, what are we going to do about it,
Nott?

03:04:42.695 --> 03:04:44.191
SAM: Are you okay?

03:04:44.191 --> 03:04:45.814
DEBORAH: I'm okay. Gnome power of two!

03:04:45.814 --> 03:04:47.260
MATT: It's a room filled with books, Caleb.

03:04:47.260 --> 03:04:48.332
SAM: I'm not. I'm a goblin.

03:04:48.332 --> 03:04:50.946
MATT: Make a choice.

03:04:50.946 --> 03:04:53.141
LIAM: I'm going to join the women up top.

03:04:53.141 --> 03:04:59.136
TALIESIN: Is there anything I see on the top of
these cabinets? There's all this space above, and

03:04:59.136 --> 03:05:00.330
I want to see if there's anything--

03:05:00.330 --> 03:05:01.452
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:05:01.452 --> 03:05:08.886
TALIESIN: All right. Come on. I'll take that.
That's a 17.

03:05:08.886 --> 03:05:15.457
MATT: Looking up there, behind one of the
cabinets, you see a small stack of books that

03:05:15.457 --> 03:05:20.460
haven't been categorized yet. They're still locked
with the same bronze binder, but it looks like

03:05:20.460 --> 03:05:23.656
they were set aside, like somebody threw them up
there to get to later.

03:05:23.656 --> 03:05:33.514
TALIESIN: Hey-- oh god, everybody's-- Twiggy, can
you grab that stack of books over there and throw

03:05:33.514 --> 03:05:36.516
them at Caleb? Or take a look at that.

03:05:36.516 --> 03:05:43.701
DEBORAH: You got it, friend! I run. I'm still
covered in disgustingness, so I start wiping it

03:05:43.701 --> 03:05:46.206
off and shaking like a dog. It flies everywhere.

03:05:46.206 --> 03:05:47.521
MATT: All over the place.

03:05:47.521 --> 03:05:48.759
DEBORAH: Where is it?

03:05:48.759 --> 03:05:50.954
MATT: Up here is where Caduceus is.

03:05:50.954 --> 03:05:55.325
DEBORAH: Up there, yeah. I'll scamper up next to
him.

03:05:55.325 --> 03:05:56.512
TALIESIN: Let's take a look at these.

03:05:56.512 --> 03:05:57.276
DEBORAH: Do you want me to take a look at it?

03:05:57.276 --> 03:06:00.710
TALIESIN: Let's look at this lock, see if it seems
trapped or something, or I don't know.

03:06:00.710 --> 03:06:02.583
DEBORAH: Yeah, I'll check it for a trap.

03:06:02.583 --> 03:06:05.267
MATT: Yeah, go for it. Make an investigation
check.

03:06:05.267 --> 03:06:06.769
DEBORAH: 25.

03:06:06.769 --> 03:06:10.213
MATT: They do not appear to be trapped, but they
are definitely locked.

03:06:10.213 --> 03:06:11.512
DEBORAH: Okay. Thieves' tools?

03:06:11.512 --> 03:06:14.707
MATT: These bronze clasps around their form. Is
that for one book?

03:06:14.707 --> 03:06:16.119
DEBORAH: No, 13.

03:06:16.119 --> 03:06:22.023
MATT: One book. You try and get there, and the
lock breaks. One of your tools snaps inside.

03:06:22.023 --> 03:06:24.948
TALIESIN: Here, wipe it on this. That's okay.

03:06:24.948 --> 03:06:26.650
DEBORAH: I tried.

03:06:26.650 --> 03:06:28.514
MATT: There's the second book and the third book.

03:06:28.514 --> 03:06:32.200
DEBORAH: Okay, second book? 21.

03:06:32.200 --> 03:06:37.395
MATT: That book, the metal brace opens up, and the
book is available to you.

03:06:37.395 --> 03:06:38.708
TALIESIN: Hey, Caleb!

03:06:38.708 --> 03:06:40.270
DEBORAH: Caleb, we got books!

03:06:40.270 --> 03:06:43.729
LIAM: Are there any sigils or writing anywhere on
the frame of the window or in the window?

03:06:43.729 --> 03:06:45.991
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:06:45.991 --> 03:06:49.333
LIAM: Balls. Five.

03:06:49.333 --> 03:06:54.074
MATT: Looking around, no. You see the smooth glass
of different colors, and you see the seams that

03:06:54.074 --> 03:07:00.593
hold them together where it's been sealed. You can
see the various colors and shapes around it. Nah.

03:07:00.593 --> 03:07:01.743
You're panicking a bit.

03:07:01.743 --> 03:07:05.525
LIAM: I want to climb down the ladder and look for
anything, not books right now, but are there any

03:07:05.525 --> 03:07:09.716
buttons or switches or anything out of place,
anything besides decor and a library?

03:07:09.716 --> 03:07:13.216
LAURA: Did anybody see what he was doing when he
disappeared?

03:07:13.216 --> 03:07:20.082
MARISHA: Yeah, he was looking in this area. He was
like, "Ah", and then I feel like I saw his head go

03:07:20.082 --> 03:07:25.335
over here. But then the bookshelf was in the way,
so I couldn't see what he was reaching for.

03:07:25.335 --> 03:07:28.270
SAM: Did anyone check this desk over here, next to
the portrait?

03:07:28.270 --> 03:07:30.200
MATT: That's what Caleb checked earlier.

03:07:30.200 --> 03:07:34.140
SAM: What about the far desk, behind the mimic?

03:07:34.140 --> 03:07:36.388
MATT: No one's looked at that, necessarily.

03:07:36.388 --> 03:07:37.762
SAM: I'll go snoop around there.

03:07:37.762 --> 03:07:43.970
MATT: Okay. You are going to head to that desk
there. Okay, make an investigation check, and

03:07:43.970 --> 03:07:45.777
perception check for you.

03:07:45.777 --> 03:07:48.446
LIAM: Perception or investigation? I'm looking for
hidden switches, or--

03:07:48.446 --> 03:07:50.780
MATT: Oh, I see. Then make an investigation
check.

03:07:50.780 --> 03:07:53.784
SAM: 18 for me.

03:07:53.784 --> 03:07:55.461
LIAM: 23.

03:07:55.461 --> 03:08:06.452
MATT: Looking around, you see, amongst all the
books that are latched in, there's one big,

03:08:06.452 --> 03:08:13.954
beautiful, red leather book with sapphires
embedded in it along the base. It's locked in, and

03:08:13.954 --> 03:08:23.527
it's placed ostentatiously in the center of the
center bookcase right there. You don't catch any

03:08:23.527 --> 03:08:26.648
other hidden chambers, but that stands out.

03:08:26.648 --> 03:08:28.658
TRAVIS: (whispering) Probably not important.

03:08:28.658 --> 03:08:36.042
MATT: You, checking the desk, it is locked. It is
arcane locked.

03:08:36.042 --> 03:08:37.384
SAM: So I can't pick it?

03:08:37.384 --> 03:08:40.890
MATT: You look it. You're like, "This is not
moving." You're not sure if it's trapped,

03:08:40.890 --> 03:08:44.073
necessarily. But glancing at it, you're like,
"This is locked," and it's locked in a way where

03:08:44.073 --> 03:08:46.758
you're not entirely certain. You could try, but
it's going to be a very hard lock.

03:08:46.758 --> 03:08:47.438
SAM: I'll try.

03:08:47.438 --> 03:08:48.179
MATT: Go for it.

03:08:48.179 --> 03:08:51.008
SAM: Natural ten.

03:08:51.008 --> 03:08:53.515
MATT: (laughs) Total of?

03:08:53.515 --> 03:08:54.594
SAM: 20.

03:08:54.594 --> 03:08:56.086
MATT: 20? It's not budging.

03:08:56.086 --> 03:08:57.265
SAM: Okay.

03:08:57.265 --> 03:09:01.515
DEBORAH: Should we open the last book?

03:09:01.515 --> 03:09:03.021
SAM: Do you have Knock or something?

03:09:03.021 --> 03:09:04.707
TALIESIN: What's the title of the first book that
we opened, by the way?

03:09:04.707 --> 03:09:07.133
DEBORAH: Yeah, is there any markings on the one
that we opened?

03:09:07.133 --> 03:09:08.585
TALIESIN: Not opening it, just looking at the--

03:09:08.585 --> 03:09:13.958
MATT: Interestingly enough, the books' titles are
not visible. They are blank, and then once the

03:09:13.958 --> 03:09:21.631
binding comes off, the title appears on the front.
The title of this says Public Debate Records:

03:09:21.631 --> 03:09:24.015
Forum of Zeidel.

03:09:24.015 --> 03:09:25.143
SAM: Yawn.

03:09:25.143 --> 03:09:29.211
DEBORAH: Third one? 20.

03:09:29.211 --> 03:09:37.576
MATT: That one comes off. This one, no title
appears. You see instead a burn mark appear on the

03:09:37.576 --> 03:09:39.204
front, like it's singed.

03:09:39.204 --> 03:09:41.029
DEBORAH: Hmm.

03:09:41.029 --> 03:09:45.722
TALIESIN: That's very interesting. Maybe, here,
let's bring it down to the table, and we'll open

03:09:45.722 --> 03:09:47.188
it from a distance.

03:09:47.188 --> 03:09:52.584
DEBORAH: Yes. We'll bring it down and put it on
the table. Shall my magic hand do it?

03:09:52.584 --> 03:09:55.450
MATT: Okay, you're watching them come over with
these two books, and they put them on the table in

03:09:55.450 --> 03:09:56.717
the center.

03:09:56.717 --> 03:09:59.139
LIAM: So burned book and--

03:09:59.139 --> 03:10:04.698
DEBORAH: It has a burned slash on it. Should I
open it with my magic hand? Everybody stand back?

03:10:04.698 --> 03:10:07.200
SAM: Yes, of course! We've got to find out what's
going on.

03:10:07.200 --> 03:10:10.079
LAURA: I turn around and watch it happen.

03:10:10.079 --> 03:10:12.138
DEBORAH: It goes forward. We're all standing
back.

03:10:12.138 --> 03:10:13.329
MATT: Which book do you open?

03:10:13.329 --> 03:10:14.949
DEBORAH: The one with the burned slash on it.

03:10:14.949 --> 03:10:22.261
MATT: Okay. As it opens up, the pages pull open
and come to rest. Nothing happens.

03:10:22.261 --> 03:10:23.888
LAURA: It's just a book?

03:10:23.888 --> 03:10:27.896
MATT: It's a book. You can see there is a place on
the inside where a name might have been placed,

03:10:27.896 --> 03:10:32.265
but that also has been burned off. You can see
from the way it opened up there are a few pages

03:10:32.265 --> 03:10:35.204
torn out. It looks to be maybe a hundred or so
pages.

03:10:35.204 --> 03:10:38.077
LIAM: Nott, Twiggy, would you both come here,
please?

03:10:38.077 --> 03:10:39.328
SAM: Yes, of course.

03:10:39.328 --> 03:10:40.384
LIAM: This book--

03:10:40.384 --> 03:10:41.647
SAM: The ruby one?

03:10:41.647 --> 03:10:47.953
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>. Do you see anything that could hurt us
by touching this? Do you make anything of this?

03:10:47.953 --> 03:10:50.275
SAM: I will search for traps.

03:10:50.275 --> 03:10:51.702
DEBORAH: I'm going to help you.

03:10:51.702 --> 03:10:53.207
MATT: It's investigation.

03:10:53.207 --> 03:10:54.265
SAM: 11.

03:10:54.265 --> 03:10:56.704
DEBORAH: If I help him, can he have advantage?

03:10:56.704 --> 03:10:58.640
MATT: Sure. If you're helping him out, yeah. Roll
again.

03:10:58.640 --> 03:11:01.333
SAM: 13.

03:11:01.333 --> 03:11:14.012
MATT: It's hard to say. It's definitely a very
pretty book. It's trying to get your attention by

03:11:14.012 --> 03:11:16.650
the way it's designed and placed.

03:11:16.650 --> 03:11:20.011
SAM: Doesn't look like it's dangerous. Looks
safe.

03:11:20.011 --> 03:11:26.016
MATT: Make a perception check, Caleb.

03:11:26.016 --> 03:11:30.205
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>. 22.

03:11:30.205 --> 03:11:35.264
MATT: You're paying attention to this layout. They
open up this book on the table, and you glance

03:11:35.264 --> 03:11:42.946
over at it. You look back, and you look back at
the book. Those are spell equations.

03:11:42.946 --> 03:11:45.074
LAURA: On the one on the table?

03:11:45.074 --> 03:11:45.750
MATT: The one that they just opened on the table.

03:11:45.750 --> 03:11:47.712
SAM: The burned one?

03:11:47.712 --> 03:11:48.885
MATT: The burned one.

03:11:48.885 --> 03:11:50.761
DEBORAH: Has spell equations in it? Okay.

03:11:56.623 --> 03:11:59.121
LIAM: We have to get Fjord out of that window
somehow.

03:11:59.196 --> 03:12:04.375
SAM: Take the book! At least take the book! Hey,
I've got an idea. I don't know how much time we

03:12:04.375 --> 03:12:06.872
have, and yes, we've got to find Fjord--

03:12:06.872 --> 03:12:07.896
LIAM: I'll touch that book.

03:12:07.896 --> 03:12:14.493
MATT: Touch the one that's open? Okay. You touch
it. It's a regular book.

03:12:14.493 --> 03:12:19.881
SAM: Caleb, do we have her Happy Fun Ball?

03:12:19.881 --> 03:12:20.704
LIAM: No.

03:12:20.704 --> 03:12:22.043
SAM: It's gone?

03:12:22.043 --> 03:12:23.574
LAURA: It didn't come with us.

03:12:23.574 --> 03:12:25.150
SAM: Do you have your haversack?

03:12:25.150 --> 03:12:29.447
MATT: Make an investigation check, Beau. Since
Jester's helping you at this point, you can do it

03:12:29.447 --> 03:12:32.337
with advantage because you guys are both glancing
at what to do.

03:12:32.337 --> 03:12:35.075
TALIESIN: I'm taking a look at that other book
really quickly as well.

03:12:35.075 --> 03:12:39.369
MARISHA: Natural 19. Thank you, Gil. 24.

03:12:39.369 --> 03:12:47.374
MATT: Skimming over it, you actually wait for a
moment where Caduceus is walking and the light

03:12:47.374 --> 03:12:53.940
hits it. You can see a point on the glass where
you can just make out the faint dimming of the

03:12:53.940 --> 03:13:00.742
reflection across the smooth surface: the
fingerprint left by Fjord. In a very Sherlock

03:13:00.742 --> 03:13:05.061
Holmes moment, you see the one moment across the
glass where it's not quite as shiny, and it's that

03:13:05.061 --> 03:13:07.711
single bit of red that's imbedded in the glass.

03:13:07.711 --> 03:13:09.154
LAURA: What do you see, Beau?

03:13:09.154 --> 03:13:12.001
MARISHA: Feels like something recent.

03:13:12.001 --> 03:13:13.614
LAURA: Okay.

03:13:13.614 --> 03:13:19.297
MARISHA: I think I know what Fjord did. Hey,
Caduceus.

03:13:19.297 --> 03:13:20.597
TALIESIN: Yeah?

03:13:20.597 --> 03:13:21.695
MARISHA: Or Caleb.

03:13:21.695 --> 03:13:22.447
LIAM: Yeah?

03:13:22.447 --> 03:13:26.744
MARISHA: Can either one of you put light behind
this stained glass?

03:13:26.744 --> 03:13:29.275
TALIESIN: I can try. I'm going to try.

03:13:29.275 --> 03:13:30.989
MARISHA: Backlight it?

03:13:30.989 --> 03:13:35.872
TALIESIN: I'm trying to cast Light on the other
side of the glass. On the glass, on the other side

03:13:35.872 --> 03:13:37.876
of the glass.

03:13:37.876 --> 03:13:42.375
MATT: Technically, it has to be something you
touch. So you can put it on the glass--

03:13:42.375 --> 03:13:44.074
TALIESIN: No, I can throw it.

03:13:44.074 --> 03:13:46.670
MATT: Light as a cantrip is a touch spell.

03:13:46.670 --> 03:13:50.370
TALIESIN: Is it a touch spell? Yeah, you are not
wrong!

03:13:50.370 --> 03:13:58.307
LAURA: I'll get down so that you can get up and
cast it.

03:13:58.307 --> 03:14:02.560
TALIESIN: Yeah, I can't put it on the other side
of the glass because I can't touch the other side

03:14:02.560 --> 03:14:04.061
of the glass.

03:14:04.061 --> 03:14:04.978
MARISHA: Caleb?

03:14:04.978 --> 03:14:11.938
LIAM: I will make four globules of light, and I
will try to put two of them on our side and two on

03:14:11.938 --> 03:14:13.255
the other side.

03:14:13.255 --> 03:14:17.148
MATT: Okay. As the globs appear on the opposite
end, they're snuffed out.

03:14:17.148 --> 03:14:20.125
DEBORAH: I think we should touch it, you guys.

03:14:20.125 --> 03:14:21.562
LIAM and SAM: No!

03:14:21.562 --> 03:14:25.869
MARISHA: Yeah, I was going to say. I have a
feeling that's where Fjord is. I think he touched

03:14:25.869 --> 03:14:30.312
this thing, which... yeah.

03:14:30.312 --> 03:14:35.128
MATT: Make an intelligence check, Caleb.

03:14:35.128 --> 03:14:42.867
LIAM: I don't know if breaking it is-- 12 plus
straight add the intelligence? 17.

03:14:42.867 --> 03:14:49.809
MATT: The void, the vacuous darkness behind this,
reminds you very closely to the hallway that you

03:14:49.809 --> 03:14:52.002
traveled in here on.

03:14:52.002 --> 03:14:53.369
MARISHA: I mean--

03:14:53.369 --> 03:14:54.472
LIAM: It's not here.

03:14:54.472 --> 03:14:56.248
MARISHA: It's maybe the way out.

03:14:56.248 --> 03:14:57.444
TALIESIN: Probably.

03:14:57.444 --> 03:14:58.899
MARISHA: Or somewhere else.

03:14:58.899 --> 03:15:05.744
SAM: Our options right now are to pull the
mysterious ruby book, to touch the glass, or to

03:15:05.744 --> 03:15:07.262
keep searching.

03:15:07.262 --> 03:15:12.004
LIAM: One of you little ones, please, would you
use your magical hand to touch-- there's a jar in

03:15:12.004 --> 03:15:16.992
that drawer and there is a bottle of ink.

03:15:16.992 --> 03:15:18.940
SAM: You want them both?

03:15:18.940 --> 03:15:21.879
LIAM: If they are safe to touch, but don't use
your fingers.

03:15:21.879 --> 03:15:23.951
DEBORAH: I'll send my hand for the jar.

03:15:23.951 --> 03:15:25.460
SAM: I'll get the ink.

03:15:25.460 --> 03:15:29.430
TALIESIN: I'm going to head over towards that
other ladder really quickly.

03:15:29.430 --> 03:15:32.746
MATT: Okay. You can go ahead and cork the ink and
take it with you.

03:15:32.746 --> 03:15:35.796
LAURA: To come up on the level where Beau is?

03:15:35.876 --> 03:15:40.526
TALIESIN: Well, there's that weird desk behind
there. Have we looked in that desk that's behind the--?

03:15:40.526 --> 03:15:42.824
DEBORAH: Yes, I did. Nott went to look, right?

03:15:42.824 --> 03:15:44.500
LIAM: That smaller desk?

03:15:44.500 --> 03:15:45.262
TALIESIN: Yeah, what was in there?

03:15:45.262 --> 03:15:49.389
SAM: Oh, it's got an arcane lock. Can you undo an
arcane lock?

03:15:49.389 --> 03:15:50.950
TALIESIN: Maybe.

03:15:50.950 --> 03:15:54.188
SAM: Can you dispel it or something?

03:15:54.188 --> 03:15:56.189
TALIESIN: I'll try Dispel Magic. Why the fuck
not?

03:15:56.189 --> 03:15:57.436
MATT: Okay.

03:15:57.436 --> 03:16:02.572
TALIESIN: I cast Dispel Magic on the desk.

03:16:02.572 --> 03:16:09.503
MATT: All righty. Double checking here.

03:16:09.503 --> 03:16:14.711
SAM: A conundrum. Right now Fjord's having coffee
with Grog.

03:16:14.711 --> 03:16:18.014
TRAVIS: (as Fjord) What's your name? (as Grog)
What's your name?!

03:16:18.014 --> 03:16:22.820
MATT: You cast Dispel Magic. There's a release of
arcane energy across it-- sorry, the divine

03:16:22.820 --> 03:16:26.514
energy. You see the sparkles slowly fade as your
concentration ends.

03:16:26.514 --> 03:16:29.445
TALIESIN: Give it a go.

03:16:29.445 --> 03:16:32.252
SAM: Okay. I'll try to pick it again, I guess.

03:16:32.252 --> 03:16:33.322
DEBORAH: I'll help you.

03:16:33.322 --> 03:16:34.837
TALIESIN: I'll head up to the stained glass.

03:16:34.837 --> 03:16:36.072
MATT: Okay. It's not locked anymore.

03:16:36.072 --> 03:16:37.632
SAM: Oh, it's not locked! Oh. We open it!

03:16:37.632 --> 03:16:41.777
MATT: It's a (rumbling). It's one of those roll
tops that slides up.

03:16:41.777 --> 03:16:43.065
MARISHA: I want one of those.

03:16:43.065 --> 03:16:44.691
LIAM: Thousand-year-old roll top.

03:16:45.271 --> 03:16:51.505
MARISHA: While they all do that, I go: I'm going
to see how Fjord's doing-- (thud)-- and hit the ruby.

03:16:51.505 --> 03:16:57.254
MATT: Okay. As this is happening, the glass
shatters. You watch as both Beau and Jester get

03:16:57.254 --> 03:16:58.699
pulled in.

03:16:58.699 --> 03:17:03.062
MARISHA: Oh. Sorry. Oh shit!

03:17:03.062 --> 03:17:05.131
MATT: It closes back behind them.

03:17:05.131 --> 03:17:08.550
MARISHA: My actions affect other people. Fuck.

03:17:08.550 --> 03:17:13.117
DEBORAH: Twiggy says: The time to be bold is now!
I'll run up and touch the same spot she did.

03:17:13.117 --> 03:17:14.615
SAM: No! Twiggy! Don't!

03:17:14.615 --> 03:17:16.430
MATT: (glass shattering) Twiggy's gone.

03:17:16.430 --> 03:17:19.929
TRAVIS: What a fucking bunch of idiots we are!
It's so good.

03:17:19.929 --> 03:17:21.566
TALIESIN: Let's take a look to see if there's
anything in that desk.

03:17:21.566 --> 03:17:22.555
TRAVIS: And then there were three.

03:17:22.555 --> 03:17:26.623
MATT: Half your party is now gone. Who knows
where. What are you doing?

03:17:26.623 --> 03:17:29.943
TALIESIN: I'm grabbing the debate book and we're
looking at that desk and then we're taking off.

03:17:29.943 --> 03:17:31.195
SAM: Yeah, we're looking in the desk.

03:17:31.195 --> 03:17:32.684
MATT: Okay. It's empty.

03:17:32.684 --> 03:17:35.178
TALIESIN: Completely?

03:17:35.178 --> 03:17:36.429
LAURA: Oh no.

03:17:36.429 --> 03:17:39.550
SAM: Don't do this! I made this mistake before. It
could be alive.

03:17:39.550 --> 03:17:42.623
TALIESIN: Goddamn it. I give up. Let's go find
everybody.

03:17:42.623 --> 03:17:46.305
MATT: All right. You guys go back up?

03:17:46.305 --> 03:17:49.928
TALIESIN: Yep. This place is weird. I did grab the
debate book.

03:17:49.928 --> 03:17:52.872
SAM: Not me. I'm staying with Caleb until the
bitter end.

03:17:52.872 --> 03:17:57.444
MATT: Okay. You stay behind. Caduceus, same thing:
shatters, pulls him in, and then closes and

03:17:57.444 --> 03:17:58.807
reforms itself.

03:17:58.807 --> 03:18:03.991
SAM: This is everything we ever wanted: a room
full of books and it's just us. Should we just

03:18:03.991 --> 03:18:05.747
stay here for a while?

03:18:05.747 --> 03:18:07.682
LIAM: They're all locked. All these books are
locked.

03:18:07.682 --> 03:18:09.629
SAM: I could pick them all. I just need time.

03:18:09.629 --> 03:18:11.675
DEBORAH: (laughing) Take 20.

03:18:11.675 --> 03:18:22.567
LIAM: (stuttering) I walk to that shelf over there
and are they free? Do the books come off the shelf

03:18:22.567 --> 03:18:25.439
even though they're locked?

03:18:25.439 --> 03:18:29.679
MATT: These books, as you pull, they're stuck in
the shelf. It seems like the mechanism has locked

03:18:29.679 --> 03:18:30.835
them into place.

03:18:30.835 --> 03:18:34.545
SAM: A mechanism! I can try. I'll try to unlock
the mechanism.

03:18:34.545 --> 03:18:36.606
LIAM: Try a single time.

03:18:36.606 --> 03:18:38.997
SAM: What am I rolling?

03:18:38.997 --> 03:18:42.111
MATT: This is to unlock. This is your thieves'
tools.

03:18:42.111 --> 03:18:43.428
SAM: 23.

03:18:43.428 --> 03:18:45.563
MATT: The book comes free.

03:18:45.563 --> 03:18:48.934
LIAM: Okay. I put it in my bag.

03:18:48.934 --> 03:18:55.683
TALIESIN: I like that you never check for traps.
It really adds to the unknown.

03:18:55.683 --> 03:19:01.811
LIAM: Just do the two next to that one and then
we'll go.

03:19:01.811 --> 03:19:02.799
SAM: Do they look good?

03:19:02.799 --> 03:19:03.803
LIAM: Yeah, they're very good.

03:19:03.803 --> 03:19:05.300
TRAVIS: Just the two next to that one.

03:19:05.300 --> 03:19:07.439
LIAM: Just do one more.

03:19:07.439 --> 03:19:12.188
SAM: All right. I'll try to unlock the next one.
That's not as good. 12.

03:19:12.188 --> 03:19:15.680
MATT: (strained) It's not moving. It's not
budging.

03:19:15.680 --> 03:19:19.111
SAM: I'll go to the third one. Ooh, that's better!
28.

03:19:19.111 --> 03:19:21.046
MATT: The second one comes free.

03:19:21.046 --> 03:19:26.431
LIAM: Okay. We're going to go follow them and
we're either going to die or get out of here. I

03:19:26.431 --> 03:19:28.503
hope we get out of here.

03:19:28.503 --> 03:19:32.560
SAM: But all these books-- you're sure you got all
the spell books? We need the spell books.

03:19:32.560 --> 03:19:35.014
LIAM: I need them. Let's go.

03:19:35.014 --> 03:19:38.383
SAM: I'm going to just see if there's any loose
books on lower shelves that I can grab on my way out.

03:19:38.411 --> 03:19:40.502
LIAM: I climb up and I'm screaming at Nott: Let's
go!

03:19:40.502 --> 03:19:41.441
SAM: Any other books?

03:19:41.441 --> 03:19:47.312
MATT: As he's moving up there? There's a bunch of
shelves: books on the bottom row, there's the

03:19:47.312 --> 03:19:49.813
center row with the big shiny book, there's the
top row with the other books--

03:19:49.813 --> 03:19:51.682
LIAM: Nott, this is torture to me! Let's go.

03:19:51.682 --> 03:19:53.681
SAM: I take two on the other shelf and let's go.

03:19:53.681 --> 03:19:55.998
MATT: You go and pull? They're in place. They're
not loose.

03:19:55.998 --> 03:19:59.334
SAM: Damn it! I'll try one. Nope. Didn't work.
15.

03:19:59.334 --> 03:20:01.066
MATT: Okay. Doesn't work. Doesn't come free.

03:20:01.066 --> 03:20:02.999
SAM: All right, I'm going.

03:20:02.999 --> 03:20:05.882
MATT: All right. You press the button?

03:20:05.882 --> 03:20:07.487
LIAM: After you.

03:20:07.487 --> 03:20:10.689
SAM: I can't reach.

03:20:10.689 --> 03:20:15.564
LIAM: I take her finger and I push our fingers
together on it.

03:20:15.564 --> 03:20:19.323
MATT: (glass shattering) Closes behind.

03:20:19.323 --> 03:20:21.187
LIAM: New campaign.

03:20:21.187 --> 03:20:22.936
TALIESIN: Been fun, kids.

03:20:22.936 --> 03:20:25.432
MATT: I'll move this out of the way.

03:20:25.432 --> 03:20:28.194
SAM: We could have done the ruby book!

03:20:28.194 --> 03:20:30.312
DEBORAH: I came to destroy your party.

03:20:30.312 --> 03:20:32.565
LIAM: It was a red herring. That was a trap.

03:20:32.565 --> 03:20:35.627
SAM: Or it could've been the spell book that
answered all your problems.

03:20:35.627 --> 03:20:43.493
MATT: So Fjord. The sensation of being rapidly
thrust through darkness at a breakneck speed is

03:20:43.493 --> 03:20:52.772
tough on you for the moment that it's there. Your
sense of physicality is stretched for just an

03:20:52.772 --> 03:21:01.001
instant, infinitely. A point of light rapidly
growing towards you until you're pushed through a

03:21:01.001 --> 03:21:07.935
circular portal of some kind. You're falling.
You're falling forward. Gravity is pulling you

03:21:07.935 --> 03:21:11.814
this direction. Make an acrobatics check for me.

03:21:13.623 --> 03:21:16.562
TRAVIS: Oh shit. Natural one.

03:21:17.622 --> 03:21:22.196
MATT: You fall 20 feet. Oh, not too bad. You
suffer four points of bludgeoning damage as you

03:21:22.196 --> 03:21:31.309
slam down onto a circular stone dais. It's rising
out of the middle of this chamber about two feet

03:21:31.309 --> 03:21:42.812
up. You slam into it, get up. There's a smattering
of bone fragments across this platform and the

03:21:42.812 --> 03:21:51.561
floor around it. Bone fragments, bones. You look
around you and you're standing in the center of an

03:21:51.561 --> 03:21:58.816
arrow-shaped chamber. It pulls back a little bit
behind you, but to the back-right of you, there is

03:21:58.816 --> 03:22:04.320
a long hallway that goes into darkness that way.
To the back-left of you, there's another hallway

03:22:04.320 --> 03:22:11.877
that goes into darkness behind you. In front of
you, the chamber continues on for about another 40

03:22:11.877 --> 03:22:20.372
or so feet. There's a dead end. It curves to a
dead end and there is a pedestal in shadow with an

03:22:20.372 --> 03:22:36.246
orb there set onto this pedestal. Before it sits
more corpse fragments surrounding glittering coins

03:22:36.246 --> 03:22:44.381
and jewels-- lots of jewels and gems-- what little
bit of low light in here is catching them. What

03:22:44.381 --> 03:22:48.303
little bit of light there is, it's just the dull
blue light. You can look up and the portal that

03:22:48.303 --> 03:22:54.993
you fell through is this faint blue sparkling loop
that is the only light source in here. The rest of

03:22:54.993 --> 03:23:00.310
it's through your darkvision. You can just see the
faint flicker of it reflect and refract through

03:23:00.310 --> 03:23:10.117
these scattered gemstones amongst this pile and a
curled mass of deep cerulean blue scales. You hear

03:23:10.117 --> 03:23:24.243
a heavy snort from under a large, rigid horn as a
pair of pale blue eyes open and focus onto you,

03:23:24.243 --> 03:23:32.513
the body of the large creature remaining at rest
while its folded wings twitch. Powerful, but

03:23:32.513 --> 03:23:38.238
surprisingly slender, this young blue dragon lifts
its head to address you.

03:23:38.238 --> 03:23:42.810
SAM: Don't worry. You got backup in about five
minutes.

03:23:42.810 --> 03:23:47.840
(laughter)

03:23:47.840 --> 03:23:49.861
SAM: We just took a short rest.

03:23:49.861 --> 03:24:00.059
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) I'm okay. I'm a fucking
sailor; I'm okay. I miss Grog!

03:24:00.059 --> 03:24:02.811
SAM: He's going to talk to you.

03:24:08.141 --> 03:24:20.753
MATT: (snarling) "The smell of unfamiliar sneak
thieves finds us. The way is shut to you."

03:24:29.176 --> 03:24:32.150
TRAVIS: I apologize.

03:24:32.581 --> 03:24:38.850
(laughter)

03:24:39.182 --> 03:24:47.667
TRAVIS: I seem to have stumbled somewhere where I
am not welcome.

03:24:48.912 --> 03:24:51.740
MATT: "That, you have."

03:24:54.533 --> 03:25:05.758
TRAVIS: If you would simply point towards the
exit, I would be most obliged.

03:25:07.962 --> 03:25:14.110
MATT: You're not entirely certain where the pile
of loot and the creature's body really begins.

03:25:14.110 --> 03:25:19.346
It's partially submerged into this nest that it's
burrowed itself into. Besides from its neck that

03:25:19.346 --> 03:25:26.632
slowly begins to extend as its head lifts to meet
your height, you can't really see the rest of it.

03:25:26.632 --> 03:25:44.546
It looks you over, its eyes taking in your shape.
"Where's the fun in that? Why are you here, little morsel?"

03:25:47.609 --> 03:25:50.612
TRAVIS: Can I be entirely honest with you?

03:25:51.591 --> 03:25:53.236
MATT: "Oh, please."

03:25:54.371 --> 03:26:07.732
TRAVIS: I have recently been putting my hands
where they don't belong. This time it sent me to you.

03:26:09.199 --> 03:26:11.795
MATT: "And what have we learned?"

03:26:13.479 --> 03:26:17.476
TRAVIS: Probably to look and not touch.

03:26:19.479 --> 03:26:31.971
MATT: "Good. Tell me, what else have those grubby
hands touched? I like to know the flavors to expect."

03:26:34.179 --> 03:26:42.705
TRAVIS: Well, you know I do have a very salty
variety myself. I'll summon the falchion in my hand.

03:26:42.705 --> 03:26:49.050
MATT: The falchion appears. At which point, the
head curls back and one of the arms (loud impact).

03:26:49.050 --> 03:26:53.190
You hear coins scatter as the impact sends bits of
its loot across the stone floor and into the

03:26:53.190 --> 03:27:02.155
shadows around. "Ah. It's been a while since my
food has played back."

03:27:04.623 --> 03:27:12.119
TRAVIS: Now listen, I don't want to disturb you
any further. I'm just going to see myself out

03:27:12.119 --> 03:27:23.673
stage left over here. You have a nice day and
enjoy your vast fortune. I'll start to walk

03:27:23.673 --> 03:27:27.365
towards that left tunnel.

03:27:27.365 --> 03:27:32.173
MATT: Okay. As soon as you turn, you hear another
(loud impact) as the other arm impacts. The ground

03:27:32.173 --> 03:27:36.671
shakes a little beneath you. Make a perception
check with disadvantage because you're scared as shit.

03:27:36.671 --> 03:27:41.743
TRAVIS: Where'd you get that impression? Natural
one!

03:27:42.374 --> 03:27:44.726
MATT: You can't even focus. Your eyes blur for a
moment.

03:27:44.726 --> 03:27:46.487
TRAVIS: Yeah, small tears.

03:27:46.487 --> 03:27:48.180
LIAM: You got the jake legs.

03:27:48.180 --> 03:27:59.734
MATT: It stands there and goes, "Halas has not
returned in an age. You shall keep me entertained

03:27:59.734 --> 03:28:01.732
"for now."

03:28:01.732 --> 03:28:09.368
TRAVIS: That's funny, I've actually heard that
name before, Halas. We saw some of his belongings.

03:28:09.368 --> 03:28:16.293
Before you devour me like a tiny little shrimp,
would you mind a small request in letting me know

03:28:16.293 --> 03:28:18.542
who that person was?

03:28:18.542 --> 03:28:20.561
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

03:28:20.561 --> 03:28:27.800
TRAVIS: I am charismatic. (squealing) 23! Natural
19.

03:28:28.230 --> 03:28:31.964
MATT: Still standing, you glance over your
shoulder and you can see now its form. It's maybe,

03:28:31.964 --> 03:28:39.310
from wing tip to wing tip, about 20 or so feet.
The body itself is not incredibly massive. This is

03:28:39.310 --> 03:28:45.306
a younger dragon, but it's still a <i>fucking
dragon</i>.

03:28:45.306 --> 03:28:51.294
TRAVIS: Cool when there are six others, seven
others. (panicked mumbling)

03:28:51.294 --> 03:28:57.510
MATT: It turns its head curiously towards you and
breathes. As it does, you watch these crackling

03:28:57.510 --> 03:29:04.800
blue bolts between its teeth, arcing between the
jaws. It opens up slightly, the tongue running

03:29:04.800 --> 03:29:13.803
itself over the front. "I don't know where he
walks these days. It's been a while, but we have

03:29:13.803 --> 03:29:15.431
"an arrangement."

03:29:17.399 --> 03:29:20.495
TRAVIS: An arrangement, you and he?

03:29:20.495 --> 03:29:31.920
MATT: "Yes. I keep watch on some of his
surroundings and he sends me food and gifts. One

03:29:31.920 --> 03:29:40.960
"day I'll be big enough to eat him and this will
all be mine. But until then, I'm fine with the flattery."

03:29:42.880 --> 03:29:48.862
TRAVIS: How does he send you these, I assume,
incredible gifts?

03:29:48.862 --> 03:29:52.297
MATT: "He leaves little pockets around the
world."

03:29:53.996 --> 03:30:02.981
TRAVIS: I don't want to bring up a touchy subject,
but I feel like your friend might be dead.

03:30:04.999 --> 03:30:15.478
MATT: He thinks for a second to himself. "Time
does move strangely chamber to chamber here. If he

03:30:15.478 --> 03:30:21.113
"is, well, I guess that makes me lord of the
manor."

03:30:21.113 --> 03:30:24.048
MARISHA: Oh no.

03:30:24.048 --> 03:30:27.839
MATT: You hear another-- (footsteps)

03:30:27.839 --> 03:30:32.550
TRAVIS: Manor? Are we in a house?

03:30:32.975 --> 03:30:41.794
MATT: "More or less." (footsteps) "If you can call
the hundred or so chambers here a house."

03:30:41.794 --> 03:30:48.361
TRAVIS: Jeez. You know, I hate to leave you
without a friend. I mean, if this guy's up and

03:30:48.361 --> 03:30:53.735
left you high and dry, maybe I could offer my
services.

03:30:53.735 --> 03:31:01.737
MATT: Make a persuasion check. Roll fucking high.

03:31:03.205 --> 03:31:04.921
TRAVIS: 14.

03:31:04.921 --> 03:31:18.896
MATT: He goes, "Huh. I appreciate the offer, but I
tend to work solo and let's be honest, I'm

03:31:18.896 --> 03:31:27.079
"hungry." There are a few flashes from the center
of the above hallway as a few bodies fall through.

03:31:27.425 --> 03:31:34.839
Beau and Jester both come falling through, Bill
and Ted style. Both of you guys make acrobatics

03:31:34.839 --> 03:31:36.166
checks for me.

03:31:36.166 --> 03:31:37.355
TRAVIS: I was trying to draw that shit out--

03:31:37.355 --> 03:31:38.081
LAURA: Natural 20!

03:31:38.081 --> 03:31:40.352
MATT: You three-point land.

03:31:40.352 --> 03:31:43.350
MARISHA: You're good! 12!

03:31:43.350 --> 03:31:47.800
MATT: You three-point land. (bones cracking)
(screams)

03:31:47.800 --> 03:31:54.041
TRAVIS: You have no idea how happy I am to see
you. Dragon!

03:31:54.041 --> 03:32:02.601
MATT: Five point of bludgeoning damage to you. As
you land, the dragon rears up, caught off guard,

03:32:02.601 --> 03:32:06.383
wings up in the air. I'm going to pull the map
out.

03:32:06.383 --> 03:32:09.605
(cheering)

03:32:09.605 --> 03:32:17.037
SAM: Oh my god. D&amp;D Beyond.

03:32:17.037 --> 03:32:18.975
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

03:32:18.975 --> 03:32:20.877
MARISHA: This feels like a lot.

03:32:20.877 --> 03:32:26.282
TRAVIS: Damn it. Ooh!

03:32:26.282 --> 03:32:31.306
TALIESIN: Turn it around this way. Oh boy.

03:32:31.830 --> 03:32:40.640
MATT: For this, Jester landed there. Fjord--
sorry, Beau is prone there.

03:32:40.640 --> 03:32:45.952
TRAVIS: I started to take a step to the left while
facing the dragon.

03:32:45.952 --> 03:32:50.691
MATT: And the dragon is right there.

03:32:50.907 --> 03:32:55.208
LAURA: Okay. The minute he rears up, I'm going to
Invoke Duplicity again.

03:32:55.208 --> 03:32:57.342
MATT: Well, let's roll initiative first.

03:33:07.612 --> 03:33:11.104
TALIESIN: There's a lot happening here.

03:33:11.688 --> 03:33:13.171
MATT: Rolled really shitty initiative.

03:33:13.171 --> 03:33:13.858
TRAVIS: Did he?

03:33:13.858 --> 03:33:17.879
MATT: Yeah. He rolled a two. 25 to 20?

03:33:17.879 --> 03:33:20.862
LIAM: Only those present?

03:33:20.862 --> 03:33:23.258
MATT: Yeah, only those present. 20 to 15?

03:33:23.258 --> 03:33:24.122
TRAVIS: 16.

03:33:24.122 --> 03:33:25.594
MARISHA: 15.

03:33:26.133 --> 03:33:27.853
LAURA: Six.

03:33:27.853 --> 03:33:31.881
TALIESIN and DEBORAH: Oh boy.

03:33:31.881 --> 03:33:34.107
MATT: Six for Jester?

03:33:34.107 --> 03:33:34.786
LAURA: Yeah.

03:33:34.786 --> 03:33:41.992
TRAVIS: Why do warlocks only have two fucking
spell slots right now?

03:33:45.258 --> 03:33:52.988
MATT: Top of the round. Fjord, you're up. Looking
down at the end of this chamber, it's dark.

03:33:52.988 --> 03:33:57.746
There's no light source, but you have darkvision.
To perceive anything in there, you have to make an

03:33:57.746 --> 03:34:06.836
action, but it's up to you. So your choice right
now is focus on the dragon or explore your surroundings.

03:34:09.568 --> 03:34:16.595
TRAVIS: I'm going to focus on the dragon because
my friends are here and I'm going to cast Blink.

03:34:17.258 --> 03:34:25.131
MATT: Okay. Over there, we're going to throw the--
Is Blink concentration?

03:34:25.131 --> 03:34:28.065
TRAVIS: It is not.

03:34:28.489 --> 03:34:32.322
MATT: Correct. So you're not even concentrating.
All right, cool. So you cast Blink on yourself.

03:34:32.322 --> 03:34:37.883
TRAVIS: And with my bonus action, I will set
Hexblade's Curse on that blue dragon.

03:34:37.883 --> 03:34:41.581
SAM: (exaggerated Southern accent) Hexblade's
Curse.

03:34:42.013 --> 03:34:48.820
MATT: As you cast on yourself and turn around,
releasing your hand towards it, the shadows from

03:34:48.820 --> 03:34:56.071
the nearby area cling to it like chunks of a
venomous symbiote for a second. As they grind into

03:34:56.071 --> 03:34:58.484
the corners of where its body is, the curse takes
effect.

03:34:58.984 --> 03:35:00.459
TRAVIS: All right.

03:35:00.459 --> 03:35:05.960
MATT: That's the end of your turn, so I think you
get to roll, right?

03:35:06.773 --> 03:35:08.912
TRAVIS: No. Blink was my action.

03:35:08.912 --> 03:35:10.465
MATT: Correct, but at the end of each of your
turns--

03:35:10.465 --> 03:35:22.464
TRAVIS: Oh, I do. I roll. Yep. That is 11.

03:35:22.464 --> 03:35:30.107
MATT: On 11 or higher, you vanish from the current
plane. That's where you were. You disappear. That

03:35:30.107 --> 03:35:35.442
ends your go. Beau, you're up. You're on the
ground. Looking around, there's a dragon there.

03:35:35.442 --> 03:35:39.157
Fjord turns this way and vanishes. There's two of
these darkened hallways. What are you doing?

03:35:39.157 --> 03:35:48.652
MARISHA: I turn to Jester and I go: Fjord just
fucking vanished again! And I go: I don't know how

03:35:48.652 --> 03:36:01.050
this works! I take out the red elemental gem that
I've had for a very long time, and I... use it. I was

03:36:01.267 --> 03:36:07.940
going to say I smash it, but then I felt that
might be deeply irresponsible because then it

03:36:07.940 --> 03:36:10.228
could just smash.

03:36:10.228 --> 03:36:13.139
LAURA: Maybe you can punch him with the gem.

03:36:13.139 --> 03:36:15.513
SAM: Punch the gem at him.

03:36:15.513 --> 03:36:17.934
MARISHA: Badminton.

03:36:18.824 --> 03:36:23.697
MATT: Red elemental gem. A fire elemental is
summoned as if you cast the Conjure Elemental

03:36:23.697 --> 03:36:29.958
spell, and the gem's magic is lost. So as you
throw it, it shatters. I don't have a fire

03:36:29.958 --> 03:36:35.828
elemental thing on me, so we'll use this for the
time being. As you throw it, it breaks on the

03:36:35.828 --> 03:36:41.080
ground there. Suddenly, rising from the impact,
the flames swirl and build up into a full-fledged

03:36:41.080 --> 03:36:44.592
fire elemental beneath.

03:36:44.592 --> 03:36:47.156
MARISHA: I go: Fuck him up!

03:36:47.156 --> 03:36:50.678
MATT: As for the Conjure Elemental spell, let's
see if it gets its action right now.

03:36:50.678 --> 03:36:52.695
TRAVIS: Just hope it listens to what you say.

03:36:52.695 --> 03:36:58.650
MARISHA: God, well, I think it's one of those
things where, if something bad happens, it turns on us.

03:36:58.650 --> 03:37:00.441
DEBORAH: I think it does. I think it's
concentration.

03:37:00.441 --> 03:37:03.179
MARISHA: Yeah, if I lose concentration, but I
don't know--

03:37:03.179 --> 03:37:07.191
MATT: Yeah, it is concentration, so you're
considered concentrating right now. It's friendly

03:37:07.191 --> 03:37:09.384
to you and your companions. Roll initiative for
the elemental.

03:37:09.384 --> 03:37:14.332
MARISHA: Okay. What do I-- that's not good.

03:37:14.332 --> 03:37:16.313
MATT: Do you have stats for the elemental?

03:37:16.313 --> 03:37:19.997
MARISHA: Nope. I did when I was a druid.

03:37:19.997 --> 03:37:23.953
MATT: It's okay. I'll find it right now for you,
and I'll text it to you.

03:37:23.953 --> 03:37:26.772
MARISHA: I can also use D&amp;D Beyond.

03:37:26.772 --> 03:37:30.803
MATT: Yeah, do that. Pull up the fire elemental
there. Initiative, what's the number on there?

03:37:30.803 --> 03:37:33.276
MARISHA: Search. What's his initiative?

03:37:33.276 --> 03:37:34.863
LIAM: You rolled a six.

03:37:34.863 --> 03:37:36.086
MARISHA: Uh-huh. What's his dex?

03:37:36.086 --> 03:37:37.521
LIAM: Plus his dex, so nine total.

03:37:37.521 --> 03:37:39.167
MARISHA: Nine. <i>Nein.</i>

03:37:39.167 --> 03:37:48.945
MATT: You got it. That's your action. Your
movement? You're still prone.

03:37:48.945 --> 03:37:50.848
MARISHA: So I stand.

03:37:50.848 --> 03:37:54.462
MATT: Okay. Half your movement.

03:37:54.462 --> 03:38:05.482
MARISHA: I'm going to back up towards this alcove
a little bit, right behind me. Yep. I'm going to

03:38:05.482 --> 03:38:09.204
use my bonus action to take Patient Defense.

03:38:09.204 --> 03:38:15.824
MATT: You got it. Okay. That ends your turn. The
fire elemental's turn now. It goes. It is next in

03:38:15.824 --> 03:38:17.192
the initiative order.

03:38:17.192 --> 03:38:25.073
MARISHA: Okay, I would like for it to get up to it
and to do melee attacks.

03:38:25.073 --> 03:38:27.605
MATT: Go for it.

03:38:27.605 --> 03:38:29.379
LAURA: Is the dragon still on the ground, or is
it--

03:38:29.379 --> 03:38:33.370
MATT: It's still on the ground. The mini has it
flying up, but it hasn't risen yet.

03:38:33.370 --> 03:38:42.430
MARISHA: Hang on, sorry. I'm going to do the
multiattack, so two touch attacks. First one,

03:38:42.430 --> 03:38:47.148
that's okay. Wait, what am I? Sorry.

03:38:47.148 --> 03:38:50.489
LIAM: Plus that. Plus six for your touch attack,
so 18.

03:38:50.489 --> 03:38:53.641
MATT: 18 just hits.

03:38:53.641 --> 03:38:56.477
TRAVIS: It lights up this place for you big time.

03:38:56.477 --> 03:38:58.560
MARISHA: 18 is the dragon's AC.

03:38:58.560 --> 03:39:00.697
MATT: Correct. Does it catch fire?

03:39:00.697 --> 03:39:10.343
MARISHA: And then one more attack. Oh, yes, and it
does 2d6 plus three, which is five plus three.

03:39:10.343 --> 03:39:19.385
Eight, and it does catch on fire. Then it's going
to do another attack, which, I think it fails. It

03:39:19.385 --> 03:39:20.718
definitely fails.

03:39:20.718 --> 03:39:23.904
MATT: Okay, that's the end of the fire elemental's
turn. Is it going to stay there or going to move?

03:39:23.904 --> 03:39:27.590
MARISHA: No, it's going to stay there and be like:
What's up, I'm a fire elemental.

03:39:27.590 --> 03:39:29.079
MATT: Jester, you're up.

03:39:29.079 --> 03:39:39.071
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to cast Spirit Guardians on
myself.

03:39:39.071 --> 03:39:49.285
MATT: Okay. You are now concentrating on Spirit
Guardians. It's a wisdom save for the dragon. Is

03:39:49.285 --> 03:39:53.250
it friendly? Oh, look at that. Thank you for
pulling that out for me. Even better.

03:39:53.250 --> 03:39:56.973
SAM: Fire elemental. All the toys.

03:39:56.973 --> 03:40:01.866
MATT: You're amazing. That's a wisdom saving
throw, right?

03:40:01.866 --> 03:40:03.324
LAURA: Yeah.

03:40:03.324 --> 03:40:05.941
MATT: It rolled a natural 17 plus one, so 18.

03:40:05.941 --> 03:40:07.256
LAURA: So it saves.

03:40:07.256 --> 03:40:08.411
MATT: It takes half damage, though.

03:40:08.411 --> 03:40:09.990
LAURA: Okay, so do I roll damage right now?

03:40:09.990 --> 03:40:10.929
MATT: You do.

03:40:10.929 --> 03:40:15.703
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay. No, I think it's at the
top of its turn, isn't it, that you said?

03:40:15.703 --> 03:40:18.466
TALIESIN: I think manifest and then on the top of
its turn.

03:40:18.466 --> 03:40:19.528
MATT: That's what I thought it was.

03:40:19.528 --> 03:40:20.178
LAURA: Okay.

03:40:20.178 --> 03:40:23.095
TALIESIN: It's both. Oh boy.

03:40:23.095 --> 03:40:27.359
MATT: Wait. An affected creature-- no, it's when
it start its turn. You're right. We'll come back to it.

03:40:27.359 --> 03:40:31.633
LAURA: Okay. Then I'm going to back up.

03:40:31.633 --> 03:40:34.085
MATT: Okay. Which direction?

03:40:34.085 --> 03:40:48.755
LAURA: The opposite direction that Fjord went.
Yeah, to about there. I can't do anything for a

03:40:48.755 --> 03:40:55.127
bonus action right now, can I? I can't dodge or
something as a bonus action?

03:40:55.127 --> 03:40:58.332
MATT: No, it's an action, unfortunately. Only Beau
gets to do that because she's a cool monk.

03:40:58.332 --> 03:41:04.214
LAURA: Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, then I'm
going to chill out and say: Oh no.

03:41:04.214 --> 03:41:06.412
MATT: Okay. That ends your go.

03:41:06.412 --> 03:41:11.127
LAURA: Oh wait! Oh, I backed up. That's okay.

03:41:11.127 --> 03:41:17.386
MATT: Well, the dragon is going to take its turn.
The dragon is going to turn this way as it moves

03:41:17.386 --> 03:41:21.345
around the fire elemental that struck it. First,
it takes d6 damage, right, from being on fire?

03:41:21.345 --> 03:41:23.254
MARISHA: It takes d10 damage.

03:41:23.254 --> 03:41:25.721
MATT: d10 damage. Roll a d10.

03:41:25.721 --> 03:41:27.410
MARISHA: Eight!

03:41:27.410 --> 03:41:34.517
MATT: Eight points of damage. "Insolent
creatures." (footsteps) Turns around on the fire

03:41:34.517 --> 03:41:41.968
elemental and releases this burst of electrical
energy. This lightning bolt arcs from the front of

03:41:41.968 --> 03:41:46.919
its snout or channeled the horn through the fire
elemental and towards Beau.

03:41:46.919 --> 03:41:49.135
MARISHA: Okay.

03:41:49.135 --> 03:41:54.852
MATT: Spirit Guardians...

03:41:54.852 --> 03:41:58.958
MARISHA: I have Patient Defense.

03:41:58.958 --> 03:42:02.658
MATT: Correct, so you're too far away from it. So
it doesn't take any damage. Patient Defense

03:42:02.658 --> 03:42:08.288
doesn't do anything. You have to make a dexterity
saving throw, and the fire elemental does as well.

03:42:08.288 --> 03:42:17.735
MARISHA: Okay. Dexterity saving throw. Okay. 21.

03:42:17.735 --> 03:42:22.150
MATT: That's a success. Roll for the fire
elemental.

03:42:22.150 --> 03:42:26.311
MARISHA: Can I use evasion, or does that matter
right now?

03:42:26.311 --> 03:42:28.442
MATT: Evasion happens-- oh yeah, so you take no
damage.

03:42:28.442 --> 03:42:29.831
MARISHA: I take no damage. Evasion, yeah.

03:42:29.831 --> 03:42:34.029
MATT: You take no damage. Roll a dexterity saving
throw for the fire elemental. You duck out of the

03:42:34.029 --> 03:42:36.995
way. It strikes the wall, the stone exploding from
the impact.

03:42:36.995 --> 03:42:39.305
MARISHA: Not good.

03:42:39.305 --> 03:42:41.596
MATT: The fire elemental takes 55 points of
lightning damage.

03:42:41.596 --> 03:42:43.582
ALL: Ooh!

03:42:43.582 --> 03:42:45.657
TRAVIS: Fifty-fucking-five?!

03:42:45.657 --> 03:42:50.431
LAURA: Get the fuck out! That would kill us
instantly if it hits us! At least, it would almost

03:42:50.431 --> 03:42:52.231
kill me instantly.

03:42:52.231 --> 03:42:53.637
LIAM: It would kill me.

03:42:53.637 --> 03:42:59.061
TRAVIS: (screaming) Oh, Matthew!

03:42:59.061 --> 03:43:01.210
SAM: Why would you do this to Deborah Ann Woll?

03:43:01.210 --> 03:43:02.794
TRAVIS: I'm sorry I touched the window!

03:43:02.794 --> 03:43:09.283
DEBORAH: Deborah Ann Woll has a plan! Get to where
I fall in! I'm still in inter-dimensional space!

03:43:09.283 --> 03:43:11.310
MARISHA: You said 57 damage?

03:43:11.310 --> 03:43:12.358
MATT: Correct.

03:43:12.358 --> 03:43:13.512
MARISHA: 52 damage?

03:43:13.512 --> 03:43:15.741
MATT: 52 damage. No, I'm sorry, 55.

03:43:15.741 --> 03:43:21.418
SAM: Maybe we can give it the rotten drug fruit
that we have.

03:43:21.418 --> 03:43:25.691
MATT: It's going to then fly back around to get a
better area. This is actually going to take up in

03:43:25.691 --> 03:43:27.291
the air.

03:43:27.291 --> 03:43:29.717
LIAM: How high is the ceiling in here?

03:43:29.717 --> 03:43:34.343
MATT: The ceiling is 20 feet, so it gets to max at
the very top. It's ten feet above anybody, so it's

03:43:34.343 --> 03:43:38.658
out of melee range unless somebody can get to the
top.

03:43:38.658 --> 03:43:39.992
MARISHA: Wow. This is bad.

03:43:39.992 --> 03:43:40.965
TRAVIS: Boom! Ah!

03:43:40.965 --> 03:43:43.094
MARISHA: I have evasion. That's the only reason
I'm okay.

03:43:43.094 --> 03:43:45.126
LIAM: Wait, that seems much higher than 20 feet.

03:43:45.126 --> 03:43:48.597
MATT: It's 20 feet. It's right there.

03:43:48.597 --> 03:43:50.518
LIAM: It's hovering above. Thanks.

03:43:50.518 --> 03:43:54.197
MATT: The mini looks like it's flying when it's
not. Now it's flying. It's at the base level.

03:43:54.197 --> 03:43:55.521
LIAM: I'm with you now.

03:43:55.521 --> 03:43:59.534
MATT: The fire elemental does get an attack of
opportunity as it moves out of its range.

03:43:59.534 --> 03:44:01.326
Shrugs it off.

03:44:01.326 --> 03:44:04.638
MARISHA: Okay. Yes, it hits. I rolled a 17.

03:44:04.638 --> 03:44:05.893
MATT: 17 just misses.

03:44:05.893 --> 03:44:09.045
MARISHA: No, a natural 17 plus six.

03:44:09.045 --> 03:44:10.933
MATT: It does hit. Roll damage.

03:44:10.933 --> 03:44:12.649
TRAVIS: 17 misses?

03:44:12.649 --> 03:44:15.840
MATT: The flames are burning around its body. It
doesn't even pay attention.

03:44:15.840 --> 03:44:18.820
TRAVIS: Get me the fuck out of here. We're level
seven. Why did we do this?

03:44:18.820 --> 03:44:19.959
SAM: You did it!

03:44:19.959 --> 03:44:22.345
MARISHA: Ten damage.

03:44:22.345 --> 03:44:32.033
MATT: Ten damage. Not bad. That's top of the
round, so (approaching screams). Next up, I

03:44:32.033 --> 03:44:35.362
believe, was it Caduceus first?

03:44:35.362 --> 03:44:37.076
DEBORAH: Did you go first, and then I went after
you?

03:44:37.076 --> 03:44:38.294
TALIESIN: I think we went-- we may have--

03:44:38.294 --> 03:44:39.262
MATT: In the same round.

03:44:39.262 --> 03:44:40.306
DEBORAH: Same round, yeah.

03:44:40.306 --> 03:44:43.508
MATT: Yeah, so we'll say both of you guys drop.
Both of you roll initiative. First of all,

03:44:43.508 --> 03:44:45.421
acrobatics check.

03:44:45.421 --> 03:44:47.096
LIAM: Two minutes later.

03:44:47.096 --> 03:44:48.312
SAM: We got some books.

03:44:48.312 --> 03:44:49.377
MATT: Yeah, you read some books.

03:44:49.377 --> 03:44:50.576
DEBORAH: 14 for me, acrobatics.

03:44:50.576 --> 03:44:51.929
MATT: Okay, 14. You're fine.

03:44:51.929 --> 03:44:52.233
TALIESIN: 19.

03:44:52.233 --> 03:44:56.804
MATT: 19. You both are fine, so you land. You
actually fall past the dragon. (screams)

03:44:56.804 --> 03:44:58.877
TALIESIN: Oh boy!

03:44:58.877 --> 03:45:06.299
MATT: You land on the ground like, "What?!" (wings
flapping) There's a fire elemental burning over

03:45:06.299 --> 03:45:12.938
here on the side. It's absolute chaos. Both of you
guys now roll initiative. See where you end

03:45:12.938 --> 03:45:15.580
up on the initiative order.

03:45:15.721 --> 03:45:17.047
TALIESIN: 18.

03:45:17.047 --> 03:45:18.576
MATT: 18. Caduceus is up first.

03:45:18.576 --> 03:45:19.596
DEBORAH: 13 for me.

03:45:19.663 --> 03:45:31.239
MATT: And 13. So top of the round, Caduceus,
you're up first. Fjord is nowhere to be seen. You

03:45:31.308 --> 03:45:35.543
can see this giant shadowy mark on the stone where
electricity is dissipating and Beau looks like she

03:45:35.543 --> 03:45:38.152
just saw a ghost, maybe shit herself.

03:45:38.152 --> 03:45:41.211
MARISHA: Hey, speak for yourself!

03:45:41.211 --> 03:45:45.725
MATT: Just the look! I'm not saying you did, but
you have the look. Jester is surrounded by

03:45:45.725 --> 03:45:50.740
sparkling unicorns and is just like, "Uh!" What
are you doing?

03:45:50.740 --> 03:45:57.378
TALIESIN: Oh wow! Fuck it, I'm going to try it.
I'm going to try to cast Bane on this thing.

03:45:57.378 --> 03:45:59.595
MATT: Okay.

03:45:59.595 --> 03:46:01.349
TALIESIN: Is that insane? I don't know if that's
insane.

03:46:01.349 --> 03:46:02.602
MATT: Saving throw is?

03:46:02.602 --> 03:46:04.788
TALIESIN: It's a 16 Charisma. That may be insane.

03:46:04.788 --> 03:46:08.081
MATT: Charisma. Plus three. That's a ten. It
fails.

03:46:08.081 --> 03:46:10.546
TRAVIS: Yeah! That was a good gamble!

03:46:10.546 --> 03:46:16.108
MATT: So that now has Bane on it. Boop! All the
circles!

03:46:16.108 --> 03:46:23.827
TALIESIN: That means attacks and save rolls are
now a d4 negative.

03:46:23.827 --> 03:46:24.914
MATT: Correct.

03:46:24.914 --> 03:46:25.791
TALIESIN: All right.

03:46:25.791 --> 03:46:26.670
LIAM: Nice!

03:46:26.670 --> 03:46:30.980
MATT: Bane on that. I'll make that a yellow one.
There we go.

03:46:30.980 --> 03:46:32.686
LAURA: Is it a negative d4?

03:46:32.686 --> 03:46:37.613
MATT: Negative d4 to all its attacks and saving
throws. So you cast that, and then you have your

03:46:37.613 --> 03:46:40.303
movement and bonus.

03:46:40.303 --> 03:46:48.931
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to turn invisible.

03:46:48.931 --> 03:46:54.042
TRAVIS: We're all bouncing!

03:46:54.042 --> 03:47:00.371
MATT: Nope, nope, nope!

03:47:00.371 --> 03:47:02.167
TRAVIS: The monk's like, "Really?!"

03:47:02.167 --> 03:47:05.228
MARISHA: Where are all my friends? Bullshit!

03:47:05.228 --> 03:47:07.612
MATT: (singing) Where has Fjord the cowboy gone?

03:47:07.612 --> 03:47:15.350
TALIESIN: I'm going to run towards--

03:47:16.854 --> 03:47:18.665
MATT: Towards Jester?

03:47:19.088 --> 03:47:21.474
TALIESIN: Actually, I'm closer to that hallway.
Yeah, I see them over there. I'm going to run

03:47:21.474 --> 03:47:22.790
towards that hallway full speed.

03:47:22.790 --> 03:47:23.599
MATT: This one, or this one?

03:47:23.599 --> 03:47:25.610
TALIESIN: This one.

03:47:25.610 --> 03:47:28.604
MATT: Okay, so (counting) 30.

03:47:28.604 --> 03:47:29.856
TALIESIN: Yep.

03:47:29.856 --> 03:47:38.830
MATT: It is dark in this hallway. There's no light
source, so just be aware. That ends your turn.

03:47:38.830 --> 03:47:41.916
Fjord, you're going to appear ten feet from where
you were.

03:47:41.916 --> 03:47:44.162
TRAVIS: Ten feet closer to the end of the
hallway.

03:47:44.162 --> 03:47:46.101
MATT: You appear there.

03:47:46.101 --> 03:47:53.356
TRAVIS: I will use all 30 feet of my movement to
head toward the end to see what the fuck's down here.

03:47:53.356 --> 03:48:02.494
MATT: You rush up to the very end, and you come
upon a small alcove and a small crystal, a faint

03:48:02.494 --> 03:48:12.049
turquoise green-blue coloration to it. Similar to
the flash that consumed the room when the sphere

03:48:12.049 --> 03:48:19.543
was being puzzled. There looks to be a groove
running across and down the base of it, and across

03:48:19.543 --> 03:48:23.285
the floor, and you glance over and there's a
groove running all the way down the hallway across

03:48:23.285 --> 03:48:24.230
the floor.

03:48:24.230 --> 03:48:25.789
LIAM: Give it to Fjord, he'll touch anything!

03:48:25.789 --> 03:48:28.424
SAM: (laughter) He will!

03:48:28.424 --> 03:48:34.706
MATT: The crystal is dull. It is dark and it is
just there.

03:48:35.007 --> 03:48:42.136
TRAVIS: Did I learn anything? I don't know what to
do. I'll turn around and I'll fire two Eldritch

03:48:42.136 --> 03:48:43.951
Blasts at the dragon.

03:48:43.951 --> 03:48:46.880
MATT: All righty. Roll for an attack twice.

03:48:47.759 --> 03:48:54.387
TRAVIS: I hope that'll fucking hit. That is a 24?

03:48:54.387 --> 03:48:55.460
MATT: 24 hits.

03:48:55.460 --> 03:48:57.958
TRAVIS: Great. Second one is 23.

03:48:57.958 --> 03:48:59.510
MATT: Both hit! Roll damage.

03:48:59.510 --> 03:49:07.076
TRAVIS: Oh great, that's 16 points of Eldritch
Blast.

03:49:07.076 --> 03:49:08.262
MATT: Nice!

03:49:08.262 --> 03:49:13.268
TRAVIS: And 12 points of Eldritch.

03:49:13.268 --> 03:49:18.834
MATT: As you peer and run down the side, turning
around and firing these bolts out, they light up

03:49:18.834 --> 03:49:24.139
the hallway as they arc past, blasting into the
side of the scaled armor as they both hit. The

03:49:24.139 --> 03:49:31.023
blasts hit and take damage, but it's a dragon. It
looks over, "I see you, morsel."

03:49:31.023 --> 03:49:34.707
TRAVIS: No, you don't! You do! Four!

03:49:35.824 --> 03:49:39.641
MATT: It flickers in and out, and you're still
standing there.

03:49:39.641 --> 03:49:43.510
TRAVIS: Shit! (screams)

03:49:43.510 --> 03:49:44.948
MATT: You added your curse damage on that, right?

03:49:44.948 --> 03:49:45.629
TRAVIS: What's that?

03:49:45.629 --> 03:49:46.517
MATT: You add your curse damage?

03:49:46.517 --> 03:49:47.654
TRAVIS: I did. Yeah, the plus three to each time.

03:49:47.654 --> 03:49:51.643
MATT: That ends your turn, Fjord. Beauregard,
you're up.

03:49:51.643 --> 03:49:55.951
MARISHA: I saw Fjord dart that way, and I heard
screams coming from that way--

03:49:55.951 --> 03:49:57.891
TRAVIS: They were manly screams!

03:49:57.891 --> 03:50:06.705
MARISHA: Manly screams! I'm going to run this way
past Jester and check out this hall. My speed is 45.

03:50:06.705 --> 03:50:08.455
MATT: (counting)

03:50:08.455 --> 03:50:09.641
MARISHA: What do I see?

03:50:09.641 --> 03:50:14.275
MATT: You get there. You see this small alcove
with a green-blue crystal that's resting there,

03:50:14.275 --> 03:50:19.449
and a groove that's running along the ground and
across the wall and continues all the way down the

03:50:19.449 --> 03:50:24.336
length of the hall. You turn around and can see
that both of them meet in the center, and then go

03:50:24.336 --> 03:50:26.886
in towards the platform in the middle.

03:50:26.886 --> 03:50:31.829
MARISHA: In towards the platform or the casket?
What's with the casket situation? I don't know.

03:50:31.829 --> 03:50:36.455
MATT: This was the raised pedestal you saw behind
the dragon. You guys haven't even looked at that

03:50:36.455 --> 03:50:39.140
yet because you just saw a dragon and fucking
ran.

03:50:39.140 --> 03:50:46.447
MARISHA: Into the platform. I'm going to touch it!
I'm going to touch the crystal.

03:50:46.447 --> 03:50:48.460
MATT: Okay. You touch the crystal. It's cold.

03:50:48.460 --> 03:50:50.156
MARISHA: Did anything happen?

03:50:50.156 --> 03:50:50.864
MATT: No.

03:50:50.864 --> 03:50:52.838
MARISHA: I go: (shouting) Work!-- into it.

03:50:52.838 --> 03:50:54.070
MATT: Okay.

03:50:54.070 --> 03:50:57.797
MARISHA: (shouting) Energy! No? Okay.

03:50:57.797 --> 03:50:58.759
MATT: Nothing.

03:50:58.759 --> 03:51:04.634
MARISHA: I have a bonus action? I'm going to use
my bonus action to cast another ki point to do

03:51:04.634 --> 03:51:14.015
Step of the Wind and dash back towards the
pedestal.

03:51:14.015 --> 03:51:15.768
MATT: (counting)

03:51:15.768 --> 03:51:18.207
MARISHA: To the pedestal. That's-- yeah.

03:51:18.207 --> 03:51:21.707
MATT: All right. You're underneath the dragon now,
feeling the wind blowing down from the wings,

03:51:21.707 --> 03:51:27.273
scattering dust and bone pieces around. You're
having to squint your eyes from the bit of debris

03:51:27.273 --> 03:51:29.080
that's being kicked up from its wings.

03:51:29.080 --> 03:51:33.578
MARISHA: As I dart by Jester, I go: fucking
crystals! And that's it.

03:51:33.578 --> 03:51:35.698
LAURA: I know, right?

03:51:35.698 --> 03:51:41.215
MATT: That finishes Beau's go. Twiggy, you're up.
You see Beau vanish down and come back, "Fucking

03:51:41.215 --> 03:51:42.762
"crystals, right?"

03:51:42.762 --> 03:51:49.267
DEBORAH: Now I heard it yell at whatever-- down
this line-- I can't see that it's him, though.

03:51:49.267 --> 03:51:52.008
MATT: At this distance-- You have darkvision 60
feet, right?

03:51:52.008 --> 03:51:53.014
DEBORAH: I do have darkvision.

03:51:53.014 --> 03:51:54.233
MATT: You can see him down there.

03:51:54.233 --> 03:51:58.408
DEBORAH: Okay, I see Fjord down there. Is it
conceivable that he's fairly distracted with this,

03:51:58.408 --> 03:52:00.134
and he's not paying that much attention to me?

03:52:00.134 --> 03:52:03.206
MATT: It's conceivable. You're a tiny little
thing.

03:52:03.206 --> 03:52:04.511
DEBORAH: I'm a tiny little thing.

03:52:04.511 --> 03:52:05.633
MATT: That hasn't done anything yet.

03:52:05.633 --> 03:52:13.849
DEBORAH: I'm so little. I'm going to attempt to
hide from his sight. That hides me, so I use my

03:52:13.849 --> 03:52:19.017
bonus action to just get hidden a little bit. Is
there anything I can--

03:52:19.017 --> 03:52:22.955
MATT: Unfortunately, you are next to a very bright
fire elemental that is lighting up the area. You

03:52:22.955 --> 03:52:25.509
might have to creatively use the space. There are
outcroppings--

03:52:25.509 --> 03:52:26.892
DEBORAH: Go to the outcropping.

03:52:26.892 --> 03:52:28.889
MATT: You'd have to move into another area to try
and get--

03:52:28.889 --> 03:52:33.011
DEBORAH: All right, I'm not adjacent to it because
it's up, right?

03:52:33.011 --> 03:52:33.709
MATT: Correct.

03:52:33.709 --> 03:52:35.828
DEBORAH: Okay, I'll back into that alcove and
attempt to hide in the alcove.

03:52:35.828 --> 03:52:36.950
MATT: Okay, you are small.

03:52:36.950 --> 03:52:38.332
DEBORAH: I am tiny.

03:52:38.332 --> 03:52:40.009
MATT: See if you can try it. It's going to have a
higher DC.

03:52:40.009 --> 03:52:42.271
DEBORAH: 15? To hide? Okay.

03:52:42.271 --> 03:52:43.563
MATT: You may or may not be.

03:52:43.563 --> 03:52:54.206
DEBORAH: Maybe not. We'll see. I want to cast-- I
conjure back into my imagination. I remember that

03:52:54.206 --> 03:53:01.842
portrait that was up above the desk in the other
room, and I go: Fuck, this better work! I start to

03:53:01.842 --> 03:53:07.708
bring my hand down through the top of my body, and
I make myself look like that portrait of who we

03:53:07.708 --> 03:53:16.589
think is Halas. Now, I'm only a foot taller than
myself. So I'm a four and a half-foot tall Halas.

03:53:16.589 --> 03:53:19.458
But I have a lot of presence, okay?

03:53:19.458 --> 03:53:22.023
SAM: Mini Halas.

03:53:22.023 --> 03:53:33.449
DEBORAH: I stride forward. I go, in my raspiest,
most male voice I say: Hey! You look bigger than

03:53:33.449 --> 03:53:35.136
the last time I saw you!

03:53:35.136 --> 03:53:38.082
(laughter)

03:53:38.082 --> 03:53:40.010
SAM: (as Halas) Have you put on weight?

03:53:40.010 --> 03:53:41.444
DEBORAH: You've grown!

03:53:41.444 --> 03:53:43.267
MATT: Make a deception check.

03:53:43.267 --> 03:53:45.890
DEBORAH: I'm really bad at charisma, you guys.

03:53:45.890 --> 03:53:47.397
LIAM: Roll high.

03:53:47.397 --> 03:53:48.956
TRAVIS: You got it!

03:53:48.956 --> 03:53:52.968
MARISHA: Oh, but it was so good!

03:53:52.968 --> 03:53:55.118
DEBORAH: But I'm just playing it.

03:53:55.118 --> 03:53:58.884
MATT: Yeah, you're playing it. You're owning it as
you stroll forward, creepy extended fingers and

03:53:58.884 --> 03:54:03.510
billowing robe. The dragon is like: (winging
flapping).

03:54:04.010 --> 03:54:06.642
DEBORAH: It's a nine.

03:54:07.188 --> 03:54:12.011
MATT: And just looks right back at Fjord. It's
paying about as much attention to you as it did

03:54:12.011 --> 03:54:16.005
when you arrived. So you haven't angered it.

03:54:16.005 --> 03:54:17.267
DEBORAH: I haven't angered it.

03:54:17.267 --> 03:54:22.830
MATT: But it doesn't seem to be convinced,
necessarily. Unfortunately. Dragons are pretty

03:54:22.830 --> 03:54:26.828
perceptive. Good call, though. That ends your
turn? Fire elemental's go.

03:54:26.828 --> 03:54:28.877
MARISHA: He multi-attacks.

03:54:28.877 --> 03:54:30.449
MATT: But can it fly?

03:54:30.449 --> 03:54:33.581
MARISHA: No. It can't.

03:54:33.581 --> 03:54:35.955
MATT: It's out of range, unfortunately.

03:54:35.955 --> 03:54:42.004
MARISHA: He sheds bright light in a 30-foot
radius.

03:54:42.502 --> 03:54:45.140
MATT: (burning) There you go. Does it stay put or
move anywhere?

03:54:45.140 --> 03:54:46.449
LIAM: He could hold an attack.

03:54:46.449 --> 03:54:51.329
MARISHA: Can he move forward a little bit? Yeah,
can he hold his attack in case he's in range?

03:54:51.329 --> 03:54:54.716
MATT: Sure. He can ready his attack in case the
dragon comes in range.

03:54:54.716 --> 03:54:55.449
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:54:55.449 --> 03:54:58.391
MATT: You got it. That ends its go. Jester, you're
up.

03:54:58.391 --> 03:55:01.205
SAM and DEBORAH: Come on, Jester!

03:55:01.205 --> 03:55:05.018
SAM: Disguise Self as Halas.

03:55:05.018 --> 03:55:07.140
MATT: Just fill the chamber with Halases!

03:55:07.140 --> 03:55:08.199
LAURA: I'm going to go--

03:55:08.199 --> 03:55:09.967
LIAM: Halas, Halas, Halas!

03:55:09.967 --> 03:55:16.828
LAURA: Okay, Traveler, please let this work. I'm
going to cast Polymorph on the dragon.

03:55:16.828 --> 03:55:23.694
MATT: Okay, what's the saving throw on that?

03:55:23.694 --> 03:55:26.512
LAURA: Wisdom saving throw of 15.

03:55:26.512 --> 03:55:29.953
SAM: And he's got Bane or something.

03:55:29.953 --> 03:55:32.422
MATT: And a negative d4 to that.

03:55:35.071 --> 03:55:36.694
He rolled a 15 minus three.

03:55:36.694 --> 03:55:39.378
(cheering)

03:55:39.378 --> 03:55:41.722
MATT: What do you Polymorph the dragon into?

03:55:43.556 --> 03:55:54.757
LAURA: I'm going to Polymorph him into-- oh god.
I'm going to Polymorph him into a crimson weasel.

03:55:54.757 --> 03:56:00.953
But at the same time, I'm going to go: (shouting)
Catch him! Because somebody has to catch him.

03:56:00.953 --> 03:56:02.308
SAM: Oh god, yes.

03:56:02.308 --> 03:56:05.375
MATT: Okay, just so you're aware-- roll an
intelligence check for me real fast.

03:56:05.375 --> 03:56:09.696
LAURA: Oh no. I'm really stupid, though.

03:56:09.696 --> 03:56:12.021
LIAM: You don't want to goldfish it.

03:56:12.021 --> 03:56:13.257
LAURA: A six?

03:56:13.257 --> 03:56:20.443
MATT: Okay, gotcha. It turns into this tiny
crimson weasel. I don't have a mini for that, necessarily.

03:56:20.443 --> 03:56:22.443
LAURA: Beau, do you have a reaction?

03:56:22.443 --> 03:56:24.464
MATT: Here, we'll go there. That'll work.

03:56:24.464 --> 03:56:26.329
LIAM: Missile snare?

03:56:26.329 --> 03:56:30.080
LAURA: Yeah, would it be like missile snare? Right
underneath it?

03:56:30.080 --> 03:56:33.577
MATT: It falls down ten feet.

03:56:33.577 --> 03:56:35.951
DEBORAH: Oh, it's going to take damage.

03:56:35.951 --> 03:56:37.506
LAURA: Oh, it's got too much?

03:56:37.506 --> 03:56:40.078
DEBORAH: Well, it's going to take damage, and then
it might end.

03:56:40.078 --> 03:56:46.259
MATT: It takes one point of damage. It's still in
its form, but the fire elemental is in range and

03:56:46.259 --> 03:56:49.878
is readying its attack, so fire elemental attacks
it.

03:56:50.891 --> 03:56:52.549
MARISHA: I shouldn't have readied an attack!

03:56:52.549 --> 03:56:53.962
SAM: How would you know?

03:56:53.962 --> 03:56:58.031
DEBORAH: How would you know? It's so dramatic!

03:56:58.898 --> 03:57:13.587
MARISHA: First one, yep, it hits with a 20, which
is nine points of damage. Sorry!

03:57:13.587 --> 03:57:19.888
MATT: As the elemental slams the tiny weasel, the
weasel reverts to the dragon form.

03:57:19.888 --> 03:57:23.559
MARISHA: And he gets another attack. Oh no, wait,
he can only hold one attack.

03:57:23.559 --> 03:57:26.893
MATT: Yeah, not the player. Well, no, I'll let you
guys do all of your attacks, but I'll let the

03:57:26.893 --> 03:57:28.141
enemies do it, too.

03:57:28.141 --> 03:57:30.173
MARISHA: He hits with this one, as well.

03:57:30.173 --> 03:57:31.398
MATT: All right, roll damage.

03:57:31.398 --> 03:57:33.818
MARISHA: I'm sorry!

03:57:33.818 --> 03:57:37.580
MATT: It's okay. That's the thing you have to
consider with Polymorph. You have to decide if

03:57:37.580 --> 03:57:39.383
it's going to take damage if you're going to put
it in a tiny form.

03:57:39.383 --> 03:57:40.635
LAURA: Yeah, I didn't hear--

03:57:40.635 --> 03:57:41.576
MATT: It's all good.

03:57:41.576 --> 03:57:42.871
MARISHA: 11.

03:57:42.871 --> 03:57:45.705
MATT: 11 points of damage. That was an awesome
maneuver.

03:57:45.705 --> 03:57:47.079
TRAVIS: So good.

03:57:47.079 --> 03:57:50.573
MARISHA: I mean, I shouldn't have fucking held his
attack.

03:57:50.573 --> 03:57:54.394
SAM, LAURA, and LIAM: How would you know?

03:57:54.394 --> 03:58:00.759
MATT: Yeah, it's all good. That finishes your go,
Jester. It's now the dragon's turn.

03:58:00.759 --> 03:58:02.261
LAURA: Oh wait, I want to back up.

03:58:02.261 --> 03:58:03.825
MATT: You want to back up? This way?

03:58:03.825 --> 03:58:07.083
LAURA: No, I'll stay there. Am I within 15 feet of
him if he's on the ground?

03:58:07.083 --> 03:58:13.200
MATT: Spiritual Guardians has faded because you
cast Polymorph. So you're backing up this way?

03:58:13.200 --> 03:58:16.515
LAURA: Yeah. What a giant waste.

03:58:16.515 --> 03:58:18.252
SAM: It was not.

03:58:18.252 --> 03:58:20.130
MARISHA: You've got him in range.

03:58:20.130 --> 03:58:25.847
MATT: It is. It's in range now. Now it's his turn.
It takes fire damage at the top. Roll a d10 for

03:58:25.847 --> 03:58:27.501
the fire damage.

03:58:27.501 --> 03:58:29.814
MARISHA: Six.

03:58:29.814 --> 03:58:35.888
MATT: Six points of fire damage. All right, I'm
going to roll and see. Yeah, that's a six. It gets

03:58:35.888 --> 03:58:47.869
its lightning breath back. Infuriated by the fact
that you just turned it into a tiny little weasel,

03:58:47.869 --> 03:58:56.899
it's going to turn this way and release another
arc of lightning down. I need both Beauregard and

03:58:56.929 --> 03:59:01.086
Jester to make dexterity saving throws, please.

03:59:01.086 --> 03:59:02.718
MARISHA: I can use evasion again, right?

03:59:02.718 --> 03:59:03.919
MATT: Yeah, evasion's just an ability you have.

03:59:03.919 --> 03:59:09.035
MARISHA: If I succeed. Fuck yes!

03:59:09.035 --> 03:59:11.156
TALIESIN: Wow. That was a roll.

03:59:11.156 --> 03:59:13.992
LAURA: Oh, I rolled a natural 20! I wasn't even
looking at it!

03:59:13.992 --> 03:59:16.583
MATT: All right, that's half.

03:59:16.583 --> 03:59:23.771
LAURA: And I cast Hellish Rebuke as soon as it
hits me. If I'm alive.

03:59:23.771 --> 03:59:28.017
TALIESIN: That's a lot of rolling right now,
Matthew.

03:59:28.017 --> 03:59:30.353
LIAM: It was 50-something last time.

03:59:30.353 --> 03:59:39.589
MATT: It's 51 points of lightning damage. You
succeeded, so it's halved. You take 25, and you succeeded.

03:59:39.589 --> 03:59:41.227
MARISHA: I rolled a 25 total.

03:59:41.227 --> 03:59:42.988
MATT: So you take none.

03:59:42.988 --> 03:59:51.408
LAURA: I use Hellish Rebuke, and I go: That hurt!
In Infernal. Oh god.

03:59:51.408 --> 03:59:53.044
MATT: So you cast Hellish Rebuke.

03:59:53.044 --> 03:59:54.218
LAURA: Yes.

03:59:54.218 --> 04:00:03.654
MATT: Nothing comes out. The ice gathers around
you and then rockets behind you. No effect.

04:00:03.654 --> 04:00:07.349
LAURA: (gasps) I turn.

04:00:07.349 --> 04:00:13.664
MATT: You turn around and look at the crystal, and
the crystal is now glowing. The light that

04:00:13.664 --> 04:00:20.396
emanates from the blue-green crystal travels down
and arcs through the hallway, hits the center, and

04:00:20.396 --> 04:00:26.223
gives a faint line towards this object across the
way. Twiggy and Beau, you guys can see, as it hits

04:00:26.223 --> 04:00:31.086
the center, this very faint trickle of energy is
now hitting this far pillar where the darkened

04:00:31.086 --> 04:00:33.528
sphere is standing.

04:00:33.528 --> 04:00:35.462
MARISHA: Twiggy.

04:00:35.462 --> 04:00:37.583
LAURA: That was cold damage!

04:00:37.583 --> 04:00:39.992
MARISHA: It was cold? That was awesome.

04:00:39.992 --> 04:00:41.838
DEBORAH: Fire on the other one? I don't know.

04:00:41.838 --> 04:00:44.470
MATT: That finishes-- well, the dragon's going to
try and fly up again.

04:00:44.470 --> 04:00:46.201
MARISHA: Fire and ice.

04:00:46.201 --> 04:00:49.855
LAURA: Oh, well, that's good. You get an attack,
and the fire gets an attack.

04:00:49.855 --> 04:00:51.419
MATT: Both of you do. You and the fire elemental
do.

04:00:51.419 --> 04:00:54.721
MARISHA: Yeah, we got it in range. I'm sorry I
killed him.

04:00:54.721 --> 04:00:59.216
LAURA: No, I'm sorry I just made a weasel and not
a fucking cow or something.

04:00:59.216 --> 04:01:02.280
MARISHA: So I get an attack, and Sentinel.

04:01:02.280 --> 04:01:03.589
MATT: I know.

04:01:03.589 --> 04:01:05.943
MARISHA: No!

04:01:05.943 --> 04:01:07.346
MATT: What'd you roll?

04:01:07.346 --> 04:01:08.155
MARISHA: A four.

04:01:08.155 --> 04:01:11.302
MATT: A four. Yeah, so it gets out of your reach.
Miss. The fire elemental does get another attack

04:01:11.302 --> 04:01:13.231
as well.

04:01:13.231 --> 04:01:16.415
MARISHA: Natural 20.

04:01:16.773 --> 04:01:20.528
MATT: Roll critical damage for the fire elemental.
The dragon, however, does still manage to get out

04:01:20.528 --> 04:01:23.027
of melee range and get itself up in the air.

04:01:23.027 --> 04:01:25.784
MARISHA: Five, ten, plus another 13 damage.

04:01:25.784 --> 04:01:27.478
MATT: 13 damage? Okay.

04:01:27.478 --> 04:01:30.310
MARISHA: Right? It's dice times two.

04:01:30.310 --> 04:01:44.469
MATT: Correct. With the rest of its ten feet up
it's going (counting). The dragon is now currently

04:01:44.469 --> 04:01:46.715
hovering over--

04:01:46.715 --> 04:01:48.328
MARISHA: It's going after Jester?

04:01:48.328 --> 04:01:55.523
MATT: Yeah, we'll say it's there. The dragon,
seeing the glyphs light up, is now turning--

04:01:55.523 --> 04:01:57.088
MARISHA: Is it its turn?

04:01:57.088 --> 04:01:59.521
MATT: Yeah, it just finished its turn blasting and
uses its movement to move up.

04:01:59.521 --> 04:02:00.920
MARISHA: It takes fire damage, too.

04:02:00.920 --> 04:02:02.337
MATT: That's true. You get another ten fire
damage.

04:02:02.337 --> 04:02:03.855
MARISHA: Another six.

04:02:03.855 --> 04:02:11.249
MATT: Got it. That finishes that round. Next
round, top of it, we have-- no, because you guys

04:02:11.249 --> 04:02:13.092
came in last round.

04:02:13.092 --> 04:02:14.718
TRAVIS: Nott and Caleb.

04:02:14.718 --> 04:02:18.511
MATT: Nott and Caleb, you guys have a few more
rounds. You dilly-dallied back there.

04:02:18.511 --> 04:02:20.886
SAM: We could stay here, Caleb.

04:02:20.886 --> 04:02:22.979
MATT: You guys are looking through books right
now.

04:02:22.979 --> 04:02:26.596
MARISHA: Oh wait, no, it's the elemental's turn,
right? The elemental goes after the dragon?

04:02:26.596 --> 04:02:30.223
MATT: The elemental went after Twiggy. It already
went. It held its action, remember?

04:02:30.223 --> 04:02:31.102
MARISHA: That's right.

04:02:31.102 --> 04:02:33.480
MATT: Caduceus. You're up.

04:02:33.480 --> 04:02:35.842
TALIESIN: Okay, I saw a bit of this go down.

04:02:35.842 --> 04:02:37.420
MATT: Correct. You are no longer invisible.

04:02:37.420 --> 04:02:38.773
TALIESIN: Nope, I'm back.

04:02:38.773 --> 04:02:43.097
MATT: You saw none of this. You were over here in
this chamber. All you saw was a blue thing go

04:02:43.097 --> 04:02:46.227
(buzzing). That's all you know.

04:02:46.227 --> 04:02:48.341
TALIESIN: Lightning--

04:02:48.341 --> 04:02:53.519
MATT: You saw lightning go down there. You heard a
scream. You saw a blue glow (buzzing) up the--

04:02:53.519 --> 04:02:59.098
TRAVIS: I'm down here now going (screaming).

04:02:59.098 --> 04:03:07.291
TALIESIN: I was basically going to try this
before, anyway. I'm going to start heading, so I

04:03:07.291 --> 04:03:18.776
can get a better view, towards the edge of there.
Yeah, just so I can hold if I need to. Yeah,

04:03:18.776 --> 04:03:38.932
there's no Caleb. I'm going to yell: Duck! And I'm
going to ready a shot of Sacred Flame. Actually,

04:03:38.932 --> 04:03:42.909
Sacred Flame's not a bolt; it's an appearance. I'm
going to hit Sacred Flame on the crystal.

04:03:42.909 --> 04:03:45.104
MATT: Which one?

04:03:45.104 --> 04:03:49.774
TALIESIN: On the one behind us. The one at the end
of the-- behind Fjord.

04:03:49.774 --> 04:03:56.319
MATT: Okay. You release Sacred Flame. The flame
burns up around it, dissipates. No effect.

04:03:56.319 --> 04:03:58.716
TALIESIN: Hmm, weird. All right. That's my turn.

04:03:58.716 --> 04:04:01.082
MATT: Okay. Brings us to Fjord.

04:04:01.082 --> 04:04:02.931
TRAVIS: It burned up around it and didn't do
anything?

04:04:02.931 --> 04:04:04.035
MATT: Mm-hmm.

04:04:04.035 --> 04:04:06.028
LIAM: What kind of damage?

04:04:08.274 --> 04:04:12.650
TRAVIS: God, what do I do? Cast Armor of Agathys
on myself and smash my head into the crystal?

04:04:13.271 --> 04:04:16.396
MATT: I mean, if you want to try it.

04:04:16.396 --> 04:04:20.199
TRAVIS: It's cold damage.

04:04:20.199 --> 04:04:24.819
MARISHA: Yeah. Do the football body slam.

04:04:24.819 --> 04:04:28.439
LAURA: Even casting the spell in its vicinity. Try
casting it.

04:04:28.439 --> 04:04:32.643
TRAVIS: I'm going to cast Armor of Agathys on
myself at 4th level.

04:04:32.643 --> 04:04:37.712
(laughter)

04:04:37.712 --> 04:04:43.901
MATT: Okay. All the moisture in the air gets
pulled in and clings itself to the outside of

04:04:43.901 --> 04:04:50.542
Fjord as this icy, encased chunk of arcane armor
that gives off this mist around his torso.

04:04:50.542 --> 04:04:54.918
TRAVIS: (laughing) I smash my head into the
crystal.

04:04:54.918 --> 04:04:56.601
LIAM: Wait, is there any armor on your head?

04:04:56.601 --> 04:05:05.774
MATT: Yeah, sure! It creates this banded partial
helmet, and you crack into the crystal. The armor

04:05:05.774 --> 04:05:14.396
shatters off of you, and into the crystal. The
crystal glows. You're a bit dazed by it, but the

04:05:14.396 --> 04:05:21.530
light tears down to the center of the chamber. The
light actually brightens in the center, and there

04:05:21.530 --> 04:05:26.718
the central orb that's there that's been dark
suddenly lights up with the same dull blue-green

04:05:26.718 --> 04:05:30.919
glow as the coloration on the floor and the
coloration that you noticed very faintly coming

04:05:30.919 --> 04:05:33.476
from the inside of the orb when you initially were
inspecting it.

04:05:33.476 --> 04:05:39.923
TRAVIS: Can I use my movement now to run up
towards the tunnel where Caduceus is in the

04:05:39.923 --> 04:05:46.227
direction that the light moved? If I roll less
than an 11 on Blink, does the spell end or is it

04:05:46.227 --> 04:05:47.329
every turn?

04:05:47.329 --> 04:05:48.405
MATT: Every turn you have to keep doing it.

04:05:48.405 --> 04:05:49.160
TRAVIS: Okay, great.

04:05:49.160 --> 04:05:50.912
MATT: You can end the spell prematurely if you
want to.

04:05:50.912 --> 04:05:54.030
TRAVIS: Well, apparently I am fucking terrified. I
shit my pants and I can't Blink.

04:05:54.030 --> 04:05:58.841
MATT: God! Why won't it happen? Okay, that ends
Fjord's go. Beau, you're up.

04:05:58.841 --> 04:06:08.105
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to run over here to the
altar-casket situation and I'm going to quickly

04:06:08.105 --> 04:06:10.843
check it out. What do I do?

04:06:10.843 --> 04:06:14.973
MATT: Okay, so you walk up there, you look down.
It's just a large pillar with intricate carvings

04:06:14.973 --> 04:06:19.277
and you see runes along the side that are
darkened. There is a sphere about that big that

04:06:19.277 --> 04:06:25.479
looks similar in size to the one the got you here,
but it's not as intricate. It's more of a metal

04:06:25.479 --> 04:06:31.413
ball that has hollow runes carved in it that the
glowing blue-green light is emanating from. It's

04:06:31.413 --> 04:06:35.755
lighting it from underneath the faint glow and
it's lightning the middle of this small alcove.

04:06:35.755 --> 04:06:37.782
MARISHA: Do I still have an action?

04:06:37.782 --> 04:06:40.467
MATT: Yeah, that was just your movement.

04:06:40.467 --> 04:06:52.844
MARISHA: Can I try and replicate on this sphere
the movements I watched Twiggy do to get us here?

04:06:52.844 --> 04:06:55.835
MATT: Sure. You reach out and touch the sphere
(whooshing), Beau's gone.

04:06:55.835 --> 04:06:57.484
MARISHA: No! Fucking--

04:06:57.484 --> 04:07:01.346
SAM: Bye!

04:07:01.346 --> 04:07:03.087
MARISHA: Hope it's home.

04:07:03.087 --> 04:07:05.614
TRAVIS: "Hope it's home."

04:07:05.614 --> 04:07:11.623
MATT: That's your turn. Twiggy, you're up.

04:07:11.623 --> 04:07:15.083
DEBORAH: Oh boy!

04:07:15.083 --> 04:07:23.609
MATT: The fire elemental, right now, is no longer
under Beau's control. The thread has been severed

04:07:23.609 --> 04:07:26.906
that was keeping it controlled as an elemental.

04:07:26.906 --> 04:07:36.775
MARISHA: There's that whole thing about them which
I kind of knew going into this. Sorry. Bye!

04:07:36.775 --> 04:07:44.343
DEBORAH: Shit.

04:07:44.902 --> 04:07:47.016
SAM: Yasha's just like looking around the boat.

04:07:47.016 --> 04:07:49.036
MATT: Yep, for the next hour, the elemental is
considered an enemy.

04:07:49.036 --> 04:07:51.370
SAM: Oh god.

04:07:51.370 --> 04:07:56.042
MATT: What are you doing, Twiggy? There's Jester
currently now pinned in the back of this hallway

04:07:56.042 --> 04:07:59.349
by a dragon flying in the air. It's about ten feet
above it.

04:07:59.349 --> 04:08:01.352
DEBORAH: Am I adjacent to the fire elemental?

04:08:01.352 --> 04:08:02.239
MATT: You are.

04:08:02.239 --> 04:08:03.408
DEBORAH: I am. Okay.

04:08:03.408 --> 04:08:06.470
MATT: You are now within its melee range because
you are now considered an enemy. It was originally

04:08:06.470 --> 04:08:11.657
whirling there and then all the sudden as Beau
disappears it (growling).

04:08:11.657 --> 04:08:19.282
DEBORAH: Okay, I'm going to take out a stick of
gum, I'm going to open it, I'm going to chew it a

04:08:19.282 --> 04:08:22.169
little bit, and I'm going to take it out and then
I am going to pluck one of my eyelashes and put it

04:08:22.169 --> 04:08:26.520
inside the gum, and I'm going to keep chewing it
and then I'm going to blow a bubble and the bubble

04:08:26.520 --> 04:08:29.793
is going to get bigger and bigger until it's
bigger than me. When it pops, it covers my whole

04:08:29.793 --> 04:08:34.591
body and I disappear. So I go invisible.

04:08:34.591 --> 04:08:38.912
MATT: That is my favorite descriptor of
Invisibility I think I've ever heard in the

04:08:38.912 --> 04:08:40.482
history of my gaming experience.

04:08:40.482 --> 04:08:43.277
DEBORAH: It says "an eyelash encased in gum
arabic."

04:08:43.277 --> 04:08:45.345
MATT: That makes me so happy.

04:08:45.345 --> 04:08:47.846
DEBORAH: All right, so I go invisible. That's my
action.

04:08:47.846 --> 04:08:50.215
MATT: You do.

04:08:50.215 --> 04:08:56.902
DEBORAH: Do I need to use my bonus action to
disengage or can I not?

04:08:56.902 --> 04:09:00.191
MATT: It still knows you're there. It will have
disadvantage on an attack as you move from melee.

04:09:00.191 --> 04:09:01.025
DEBORAH: Right.

04:09:01.025 --> 04:09:02.669
MATT: Or you could just use bonus action to
disengage.

04:09:02.669 --> 04:09:03.957
DEBORAH: Or I could use my-- okay.

04:09:03.957 --> 04:09:06.915
MATT: Or just assume that it might miss, up to
you.

04:09:06.915 --> 04:09:08.604
DEBORAH: Assume it might miss.

04:09:08.604 --> 04:09:10.107
TRAVIS: Yeah, assume 55 points'll miss.

04:09:10.107 --> 04:09:12.407
DEBORAH: I'm going to disengage from it.

04:09:12.407 --> 04:09:13.293
MATT: Okay.

04:09:13.293 --> 04:09:15.774
TALIESIN: Fudge.

04:09:15.774 --> 04:09:36.472
DEBORAH: 25 feet. (counting) Shit. Sorry, guys.

04:09:36.472 --> 04:09:38.422
TALIESIN: No, no, no.

04:09:38.422 --> 04:09:41.072
TRAVIS: It's just a dragon and a fire elemental.
Yeah, take your time.

04:09:41.072 --> 04:09:52.344
DEBORAH: What am I going to do? Okay, I'm going
to-- I can use it-- oh, I already used my bonus

04:09:52.344 --> 04:09:58.397
action. Damn it, that's why I didn't want to do
it. All right, I run to the pedestal, but I don't

04:09:58.397 --> 04:10:00.411
touch the thing.

04:10:00.411 --> 04:10:03.527
MATT: Okay. 25. You're right there.

04:10:03.527 --> 04:10:05.221
DEBORAH: Yeah, I'm right there. Okay.

04:10:05.221 --> 04:10:11.874
MATT: Okay, that ends your go. That brings us to
the fire elemental's turn. The fire elemental does

04:10:11.874 --> 04:10:19.152
not know where you are. It's going to move to the
closest target. It's actually going to, as part of

04:10:19.152 --> 04:10:20.528
its fire form--

04:10:20.528 --> 04:10:22.979
TALIESIN: Is the dragon the closest to it? I
mean--

04:10:22.979 --> 04:10:27.656
DEBORAH: It would attack <i>anything</i>, right?

04:10:27.656 --> 04:10:36.842
MATT: The fire elemental is going to move through
both of you. As it bursts through, you both burst

04:10:36.842 --> 04:10:39.172
into flames. So both of you are on fire.

04:10:39.172 --> 04:10:44.969
MARISHA: Oh, sorry. It's half-dead.

04:10:45.278 --> 04:10:49.601
MATT: It is. It is going to attempt to attack each
of you once, since you're both within his

04:10:49.601 --> 04:10:54.469
attacking. Fjord, that is a 17 to hit?

04:10:54.469 --> 04:10:56.005
TRAVIS: That is my armor class.

04:10:56.005 --> 04:11:03.154
MATT: All right. You take 11 points of fire
damage.

04:11:03.154 --> 04:11:07.771
TRAVIS: Okay. That's reduced by-- Oh. How much--

04:11:07.771 --> 04:11:10.588
MATT: The armor's gone. It was consumed by the
crystal.

04:11:10.588 --> 04:11:12.096
TRAVIS: That makes it simple.

04:11:12.096 --> 04:11:15.772
MATT: That is going to be a 19 to hit you,
Caduceus?

04:11:15.772 --> 04:11:18.597
TALIESIN: 19? Goddamn it. Yeah, that hits.

04:11:18.597 --> 04:11:28.856
MATT: You take seven points-- sorry, ten points of
fire damage. That's going to end its turn. Jester,

04:11:28.856 --> 04:11:29.782
your turn.

04:11:29.782 --> 04:11:30.791
LAURA: It's my turn?

04:11:30.791 --> 04:11:31.791
TALIESIN: Ten points? 11 points?

04:11:31.791 --> 04:11:32.375
MATT: Ten points.

04:11:32.375 --> 04:11:33.407
TALIESIN: Ten points, and I'm on fire.

04:11:33.407 --> 04:11:36.309
MATT: Yes. Which means at the top of your turns,
you take 1d10 fire damage, unless you use an

04:11:36.309 --> 04:11:38.225
action to put it out.

04:11:38.225 --> 04:11:39.681
LAURA: Okay, well--

04:11:39.681 --> 04:11:40.195
MARISHA: Sorry.

04:11:40.195 --> 04:11:43.469
LAURA: Taking a cue from Fjord, I'm going to cast
Blink on myself.

04:11:43.469 --> 04:11:44.461
SAM: Hey!

04:11:44.461 --> 04:11:45.396
MATT: Okay.

04:11:45.396 --> 04:11:46.543
TALIESIN: Yeah!

04:11:46.543 --> 04:11:52.038
LAURA: Then if I try to run underneath the
dragon--

04:11:52.038 --> 04:11:53.036
MATT: Make a concentration check for me.

04:11:53.036 --> 04:11:55.152
LAURA: -- he's going to get an attack of
opportunity on me?

04:11:55.152 --> 04:11:56.715
MATT: It's above you, it won't get an attack of
opportunity on you.

04:11:56.715 --> 04:11:58.650
LAURA: No? Okay, then I'm just going to dash
underneath it.

04:11:58.650 --> 04:12:00.037
MATT: So you're not going to cast the spell?

04:12:00.037 --> 04:12:01.923
LAURA: No, by dash, I mean run. Sorry.

04:12:01.923 --> 04:12:05.543
MATT: (counting) 30. You get there. Roll a d20.

04:12:05.543 --> 04:12:06.608
TALIESIN: Is it a straight d20?

04:12:06.608 --> 04:12:07.718
MATT: It's your constitution saving throw.

04:12:07.718 --> 04:12:09.599
TALIESIN: Oh, 19.

04:12:09.599 --> 04:12:10.374
MATT: You're fine.

04:12:10.374 --> 04:12:12.597
LAURA: No. I rolled a three.

04:12:12.597 --> 04:12:17.012
MATT: You're still there. You get there and the
magic just sputters for a second. Not going to

04:12:17.012 --> 04:12:18.035
save you, unfortunately.

04:12:18.035 --> 04:12:21.346
LAURA: Okay, then for my bonus action-- I get a
bonus action?

04:12:21.346 --> 04:12:22.344
MATT: Yeah.

04:12:22.344 --> 04:12:28.287
LAURA: Yeah-- Oh I can't. Oh! I'm going to use--
Nope. I've already used a spell. Fucking balls!

04:12:28.287 --> 04:12:32.153
I'm going to do nothing. I'm going to tremble.

04:12:32.153 --> 04:12:35.535
MATT: Aww. All right, end of Jester's turn. The
dragon's turn.

04:12:35.535 --> 04:12:36.786
TALIESIN: On fire.

04:12:36.786 --> 04:12:43.251
MATT: Yes, it takes d10 damage. I'm going to roll
that. That's a nine. All right.

04:12:43.251 --> 04:12:44.842
TRAVIS: Is it looking rough? Real rough?

04:12:44.842 --> 04:12:45.455
MATT: No.

04:12:45.455 --> 04:12:47.096
LAURA: He's bloodied. He's definitely bloodied.

04:12:47.096 --> 04:12:49.355
TRAVIS: Pieces of his ribs showing through?

04:12:49.355 --> 04:12:54.215
MATT: He's getting close to-- You're starting to
see some wear and tear.

04:12:54.215 --> 04:12:58.787
LAURA: Okay. A single scale is chipped away.

04:12:58.787 --> 04:13:00.285
LIAM: 68% guys.

04:13:00.285 --> 04:13:02.976
MATT: Does not get his dragon's breath back.

04:13:02.976 --> 04:13:04.349
TALIESIN: Thank god.

04:13:04.349 --> 04:13:09.604
MATT: So instead, it's going to swoop down towards
Jester, trying to prevent you from escaping.

04:13:09.604 --> 04:13:11.653
TRAVIS: But look how cute she is.

04:13:11.653 --> 04:13:16.166
MATT: So it makes three attacks. One with its
bite, two with its claws. First attack at Jester.

04:13:16.166 --> 04:13:18.649
Okay, that's a 14 to hit.

04:13:18.649 --> 04:13:20.225
LAURA: Misses! It misses.

04:13:20.225 --> 04:13:21.610
TALIESIN: Minus a d4.

04:13:21.610 --> 04:13:22.247
MATT: Right.

04:13:22.247 --> 04:13:23.531
TALIESIN: Just in general.

04:13:23.531 --> 04:13:27.957
MATT: Yeah. As it strikes with its claw, you pull
your shield up, sparks fly off as its claw arcs

04:13:27.957 --> 04:13:35.870
across the outside of your shield. It strikes with
its other claw. Ooh, that's a natural 19 plus--

04:13:35.870 --> 04:13:38.096
that's 28, minus one, 27.

04:13:38.096 --> 04:13:40.960
SAM and LAURA: That hits.

04:13:40.960 --> 04:13:44.350
MATT: I'm pretty sure that's it. Yeah, so the claw
strike manages. As the shield pulls away from the

04:13:44.350 --> 04:13:47.621
first hit, you're not able to get back quick
enough and the second claw goes right across your

04:13:47.621 --> 04:13:51.221
torso for 15 points of slashing damage.

04:13:51.221 --> 04:13:52.468
LAURA: Cool.

04:13:52.468 --> 04:14:00.285
MATT: The bite is going to come after you. That is
going to be a 19 to hit? Minus a d4. Minus four.

04:14:00.285 --> 04:14:01.780
It's going to be a 15 to hit.

04:14:01.780 --> 04:14:04.350
TALIESIN: Fuck yeah! Bane!

04:14:04.350 --> 04:14:09.984
MATT: As it goes to bite towards you, its jaws
open, you pull back and you instinctively put the

04:14:09.984 --> 04:14:14.293
shield up to block it and its mouth comes down on
the shield, holding on to it. Caduceus in the back

04:14:14.293 --> 04:14:21.858
focuses for a second and you watch the jaw weaken
and pull back. Readying itself for another strike.

04:14:22.388 --> 04:14:27.141
That ends its turn. That brings us to the top of
the round. Caduceus, you're up.

04:14:27.141 --> 04:14:29.772
You guys are looking at books still. I'm
sorry.

04:14:29.772 --> 04:14:30.770
LIAM: It's cool.

04:14:30.770 --> 04:14:32.793
SAM: I think I can unlock this one!

04:14:34.528 --> 04:14:36.453
MARISHA: Meanwhile...

04:14:36.453 --> 04:14:37.963
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm on fire.

04:14:37.963 --> 04:14:39.855
MATT: You do. You take--

04:14:39.855 --> 04:14:41.087
TALIESIN: Can I do anything about that?

04:14:41.087 --> 04:14:43.473
MATT: You can spend an action to do so. You take
six points of fire damage.

04:14:43.473 --> 04:14:55.642
TALIESIN: That's okay. Six points of fire damage
is fine. I'm going to book it towards that fucking

04:14:55.642 --> 04:15:06.394
altar. That's 30. I can spend an action to go.

04:15:06.394 --> 04:15:07.694
MATT: To get there, yes.

04:15:07.694 --> 04:15:11.148
TALIESIN: But people are still fucking down,
aren't they?

04:15:11.148 --> 04:15:16.082
MATT: Well, people are in a couple of rough
places, and you're still missing Caleb and Nott.

04:15:16.082 --> 04:15:18.967
Up to you. You still have an action to use.

04:15:18.967 --> 04:15:28.269
TALIESIN: Fudge. I'm going to do something dumb.
Don't leave a man behind.

04:15:28.269 --> 04:15:29.847
MATT: I like dumb.

04:15:29.847 --> 04:15:35.710
TALIESIN: I'm going to-- this is going to get
weird. Halfway through my run, actually right

04:15:35.710 --> 04:15:39.905
before I start my run, I'm going to cast Meld into
Stone.

04:15:39.905 --> 04:15:43.877
LAURA and LIAM: Meld into Stone.

04:15:43.877 --> 04:15:44.665
TRAVIS: You're going to what?

04:15:44.665 --> 04:15:46.651
LIAM: He's going to Blues Traveler it.

04:15:46.651 --> 04:15:52.009
MATT: All right. It's not concentration.

04:15:52.009 --> 04:15:59.973
TALIESIN: It's not concentration. Casting Meld
into Stone so that when I end my turn, in theory,

04:15:59.973 --> 04:16:03.000
I will not be on fire any more because I'll be
inside of the stone.

04:16:03.000 --> 04:16:04.252
MATT: I'll allow that.

04:16:04.252 --> 04:16:05.022
TALIESIN: Thank you.

04:16:05.022 --> 04:16:08.822
MATT: The flame goes out because there's no air
for it to breathe. Do you step into it here?

04:16:08.822 --> 04:16:11.033
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm actually just going to walk--

04:16:11.033 --> 04:16:14.280
MATT: He Homer Simpsons into the stone wall.

04:16:14.280 --> 04:16:19.148
TALIESIN: I go and I'm going to take my 30 feet
straight towards the wall. I can't see anything,

04:16:19.148 --> 04:16:22.082
but I can move.

04:16:22.778 --> 04:16:27.818
MATT: You can use your movement to leave the stone
where you entered it, which ends the spell. You

04:16:27.818 --> 04:16:29.475
don't get to move through the stone.

04:16:29.475 --> 04:16:31.641
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk all the way.

04:16:31.641 --> 04:16:35.220
MATT: It's a lie-and-wait type of spell. Like
merge into it and stay there for up to eight

04:16:35.220 --> 04:16:40.541
hours, and then once you leave it. But the fire's
out and you have your movement.

04:16:40.541 --> 04:16:45.476
TALIESIN: I would know how the spell-- I'm going
to get as much movement as I can and then hold for

04:16:45.476 --> 04:16:47.518
the turn.

04:16:47.518 --> 04:16:53.500
MATT: 25, 30. You're in the stone, currently in
the wall. Got it. That ends your turn, Caduceus.

04:16:53.500 --> 04:16:55.288
Fjord, you're up.

04:16:55.288 --> 04:17:00.845
SAM: Twiggy's invisible. Beau's gone. Caduceus is
stone. This is going great.

04:17:00.845 --> 04:17:02.483
MATT: This is going great, guys.

04:17:02.483 --> 04:17:04.199
TRAVIS: I take 1d10 fire damage, right?

04:17:04.199 --> 04:17:08.005
MATT: Yep, you do. You take three points of fire
damage.

04:17:08.005 --> 04:17:15.541
TRAVIS: Okay. I will use my movement to-- where
the fuck am I? To run towards the pedestal.

04:17:15.541 --> 04:17:21.702
Actually, I'm sorry. Let's come this way, to
Jester.

04:17:21.702 --> 04:17:25.595
MATT: Okay, so (counting) 25.

04:17:25.595 --> 04:17:31.791
TRAVIS: (repeatedly) Uh-huh.

04:17:31.791 --> 04:17:33.856
MATT: What're you doing?

04:17:38.899 --> 04:17:43.608
TRAVIS: Let me take back half that movement and
I'll go here.

04:17:43.608 --> 04:17:45.904
MATT: Okay.

04:17:46.343 --> 04:17:55.493
TRAVIS: I'm going to-- I can't bail on Jester. I'm
going to fire two Eldritch Blasts at the dragon,

04:17:55.493 --> 04:17:56.903
trying to get its attention.

04:17:56.903 --> 04:17:58.660
MATT: Roll two attacks.

04:17:58.660 --> 04:18:02.039
TRAVIS: 25 and a 22.

04:18:02.039 --> 04:18:04.656
MATT: Both hit. Roll damage.

04:18:08.439 --> 04:18:14.835
TRAVIS: Seven points of Eldritch Blast. Ten. So 17
total.

04:18:14.835 --> 04:18:24.518
MATT: Nice. It gets hit twice. I'll say, go ahead
and make an intimidation check. Just as part of

04:18:24.518 --> 04:18:26.709
this attack, since this was your intent.

04:18:26.709 --> 04:18:28.016
TRAVIS: 21.

04:18:28.016 --> 04:18:33.782
MATT: You have the dragon's attention. He was
slashing into Jester, and after that, twice in the

04:18:33.782 --> 04:18:37.383
side of the head, it (growling) back towards you.

04:18:37.383 --> 04:18:41.278
TRAVIS: Do I have to roll blink if I don't--

04:18:41.278 --> 04:18:42.846
MATT: You can choose to end the spell.

04:18:42.846 --> 04:18:44.962
TRAVIS: But I think, doesn't it take an action or
I can just choose?

04:18:44.962 --> 04:18:49.452
MATT: That's a good question. Let's go ahead and
check. It should tell you on the spell.

04:18:49.452 --> 04:18:53.804
TRAVIS: It says, "you can dismiss this spell as an
action."

04:18:53.804 --> 04:18:55.507
MATT: Ah. So no.

04:18:55.507 --> 04:18:57.719
LAURA: No, you have to roll for it.

04:18:58.719 --> 04:19:00.091
TRAVIS: Bye!

04:19:00.091 --> 04:19:02.184
(groaning)

04:19:02.184 --> 04:19:04.714
TRAVIS: The one fucking time I didn't want to.

04:19:04.714 --> 04:19:08.229
TALIESIN: We are making some interesting calls
tonight. It's exciting.

04:19:08.229 --> 04:19:13.144
MATT: That ends Fjord's go. Beau, you're out.
Twiggy, you're up.

04:19:13.144 --> 04:19:15.453
DEBORAH: Okay. I'm invisible, so I have
advantage?

04:19:15.453 --> 04:19:17.431
MATT: For an attack you do, yes.

04:19:17.431 --> 04:19:20.812
DEBORAH: For an attack? Okay, so I realize it'll
end my invisibility to do this, but I pop back out

04:19:20.812 --> 04:19:25.075
of my invisibility and I'm going to snipe one at
him with advantage.

04:19:25.075 --> 04:19:27.815
MATT: Okay, go for it. Is this with your bow?

04:19:27.815 --> 04:19:28.943
DEBORAH: My shortbow.

04:19:28.943 --> 04:19:29.647
TALIESIN: You got a shortbow?

04:19:29.647 --> 04:19:33.800
DEBORAH: I got a shortbow. 18 plus seven.

04:19:33.800 --> 04:19:35.637
MATT: That definitely hits, and it is sneak attack
because he doesn't see you.

04:19:35.637 --> 04:19:37.325
DEBORAH: So great.

04:19:37.325 --> 04:19:40.772
MATT: You appear in that space and you let loose
an arrow that sinks itself right into the heart

04:19:40.772 --> 04:19:43.278
and scaled underhide of the blue dragon.

04:19:43.278 --> 04:19:52.279
DEBORAH: I say: You're mean! That's ten on my
initial hit, and then my sneak, seven and ten. So

04:19:52.279 --> 04:19:55.948
17 additionally to the ten. So 27 points of
damage.

04:19:55.948 --> 04:20:06.789
MATT: 27 points of damage. It's looking hurt. You
can see blood emitting from some of its wounds.

04:20:06.789 --> 04:20:10.543
DEBORAH: As a bonus action, I'm going to attempt
to hide behind the pedestal.

04:20:10.543 --> 04:20:11.360
MATT: Okay, so you move behind the pedestal?

04:20:11.360 --> 04:20:13.579
DEBORAH: Yeah. 15.

04:20:13.579 --> 04:20:15.932
MATT: You believe that you are hidden.

04:20:15.932 --> 04:20:17.909
DEBORAH: I believe I'm hidden, you guys.

04:20:17.909 --> 04:20:31.234
MATT: Fire elemental's turn. It goes this way. I'm
going to go ahead and-- Jester. Roll a d6. On a

04:20:31.234 --> 04:20:35.956
one, two, three, it attacks you. On a four, five,
six, it attacks the dragon.

04:20:35.956 --> 04:20:36.956
LAURA: Four!

04:20:36.956 --> 04:20:39.688
MARISHA: Eyy! Fuck up that dragon!

04:20:39.688 --> 04:20:44.819
MATT: It comes over to this side. It moves into
this tiny space, because it can. It's going to run

04:20:44.819 --> 04:20:51.992
past. It is going to ignite you both as it runs
through. So you are on fire. The dragon's still on

04:20:51.992 --> 04:20:58.882
fire. But it doesn't lay into you with two
attacks. It attacks the dragon twice. That is a

04:20:58.882 --> 04:21:11.453
natural 20 and a five. Miss. 12, plus three. 15
points of damage on that crit. Nice! Not bad. All

04:21:11.453 --> 04:21:14.353
right, that ends the fire elemental's turn.
Jester, your turn. First, at the top of your turn

04:21:14.353 --> 04:21:18.067
you take six points of fire damage.

04:21:18.067 --> 04:21:20.102
LAURA: Okay.

04:21:20.102 --> 04:21:22.398
MATT: You're burning. What are you doing?

04:21:22.398 --> 04:21:30.593
LAURA: I guess I'm going to-- this is so lame.
It's so stupid because Cure Wounds isn't going to

04:21:30.593 --> 04:21:34.296
do enough to fix me to where if he hits me, I'm
still going to go down!

04:21:34.296 --> 04:21:35.537
SAM: Do a higher level?

04:21:35.537 --> 04:21:36.896
LAURA: That is at the highest level!

04:21:36.896 --> 04:21:40.655
SAM: It's all you could do.

04:21:40.655 --> 04:21:41.955
LAURA: I know.

04:21:41.955 --> 04:21:45.156
MATT: What are you doing, Jester?

04:21:48.826 --> 04:21:54.429
LAURA: Fuck it. I'm going to cast Inflict Wounds
at 3rd-level.

04:21:54.529 --> 04:21:57.140
SAM: Going down fighting.

04:21:57.140 --> 04:21:58.873
MARISHA: Kill him!

04:21:58.873 --> 04:22:01.079
MATT: Roll your attack.

04:22:01.079 --> 04:22:04.458
MARISHA: Oh my god, why is he doing that?

04:22:04.458 --> 04:22:14.775
LAURA: It's just a touch-- oh, on a hit. Okay.
Natural <i>fucking</i> one. It's okay.

04:22:14.775 --> 04:22:20.540
MATT: You spin around. The flames are burning
around you. You spin to look at the dragon and the

04:22:20.540 --> 04:22:25.117
fear wells up inside you, facing it down. Even
with the flames burning around it, you can see its

04:22:25.117 --> 04:22:29.581
face coming through towards you, angry. Now that
Fjord's vanished and is no longer in its sight,

04:22:29.581 --> 04:22:34.412
it's turned its attention back to you. You think
you reach out for it and expend the spell, and

04:22:34.412 --> 04:22:37.134
you're just a few inches short.

04:22:37.134 --> 04:22:44.668
LAURA: I'm all alone. I'm going to try and blink,
then.

04:22:44.668 --> 04:22:46.902
MATT: Okay. So you're ending your turn there,
you're not going to move?

04:22:46.902 --> 04:22:48.764
LAURA: Well, if I move it's going to attack me.

04:22:48.764 --> 04:22:50.096
MATT: That's true.

04:22:50.096 --> 04:22:51.147
LAURA: So I'm hoping...

04:22:51.147 --> 04:22:51.856
TRAVIS: Come on.

04:22:51.856 --> 04:22:53.584
MARISHA: Blink!

04:22:53.584 --> 04:22:55.087
LAURA: 19!

04:22:55.087 --> 04:22:59.269
(cheering)

04:22:59.269 --> 04:23:02.638
TRAVIS: When you come back, remember it's ten feet
from where--

04:23:02.638 --> 04:23:04.138
LAURA: Ten feet from where I was.

04:23:04.138 --> 04:23:05.655
SAM: Are you invisible with Blink?

04:23:05.655 --> 04:23:07.116
LAURA: You're in another plane.

04:23:07.116 --> 04:23:08.648
SAM: Oh, thank Jesus.

04:23:08.648 --> 04:23:12.323
LIAM: Twiggy is the only visible person.

04:23:12.323 --> 04:23:15.627
DEBORAH: I'm hiding, kind of? Really well.

04:23:15.627 --> 04:23:25.820
MATT: The dragon's turn. Top of its turn, it does
get its breath back. It rolled a six. It comes

04:23:25.820 --> 04:23:31.248
through the hallway angrily.

04:23:31.248 --> 04:23:33.820
TALIESIN: Does it get an attack of opportunity?

04:23:33.820 --> 04:23:40.132
MATT: It does. So I'll roll the attack for the
elemental. Another natural 20! Holy shit. This is

04:23:40.132 --> 04:23:45.129
the luckiest damn elemental in the world. That's
12 plus three, another 15 points of damage.

04:23:45.129 --> 04:23:47.110
SAM: Whoa.

04:23:47.110 --> 04:23:54.342
MATT: The dragon also takes, because it's still on
fire, an additional six points of damage. It's

04:23:54.342 --> 04:23:56.031
looking hurt.

04:23:56.031 --> 04:23:58.216
TRAVIS: "It's looking hurt."

04:23:58.216 --> 04:24:06.137
MATT: I'm going to see if it rolls high enough
perception to see you. Natural 18. It comes in the

04:24:06.137 --> 04:24:16.014
chamber. (sniffing) (crackling blast) This beam of
vibrant blue, electrical energy arcs towards you.

04:24:16.014 --> 04:24:18.372
Make a dexterity saving throw.

04:24:18.372 --> 04:24:20.360
DEBORAH: Evasion, but we'll do it.

04:24:20.360 --> 04:24:22.022
TALIESIN: You also still have this, I think.

04:24:22.022 --> 04:24:23.207
DEBORAH: Pretty good.

04:24:23.207 --> 04:24:24.491
LAURA: Oh, that's right! You have the mote!

04:24:24.491 --> 04:24:25.687
TALIESIN: Just in case.

04:24:25.687 --> 04:24:26.672
DEBORAH: What is that?

04:24:26.672 --> 04:24:28.587
TALIESIN: That's another roll, if you need it.

04:24:28.587 --> 04:24:33.157
DEBORAH: Oh, I have another? I may not need it.
Just a dexterity saving throw, right?

04:24:33.157 --> 04:24:34.232
MATT: Correct.

04:24:34.232 --> 04:24:37.896
DEBORAH: Yeah, I mean that's a 23. Sorry, yes,
23.

04:24:37.896 --> 04:24:42.991
MATT: It just barely skims, singeing the edges of
the branches that are sticking out of your hair.

04:24:42.991 --> 04:24:48.867
The rat's nest themselves curling back from the
momentary heat as the flash of energy, but you

04:24:48.867 --> 04:24:54.362
avoid it entirely. Slams into the wall behind you.
Stone breaks and splinters and the energy

04:24:54.362 --> 04:25:00.084
dissipates throughout the area. No damage. Rogues
and evasion, man.

04:25:00.084 --> 04:25:02.294
LIAM: Five little lit candles.

04:25:02.294 --> 04:25:05.227
DEBORAH: Yep. Marshmallows toasting.

04:25:05.227 --> 04:25:10.933
MATT: It looks furious. (roaring) The breath
itself-- it smells like burnt ozone.

04:25:10.933 --> 04:25:13.756
DEBORAH: I actually still look like Halas because
it's not concentration.

04:25:13.756 --> 04:25:15.461
MATT: That's true, yeah.

04:25:15.461 --> 04:25:18.355
DEBORAH: It thinks I'm a four-foot tall Halas.

04:25:18.355 --> 04:25:19.821
LIAM: It went through the head.

04:25:19.821 --> 04:25:23.501
MATT: It's really confused by it. That ends its
turn. Top of the round.

04:25:23.501 --> 04:25:26.888
DEBORAH: Where are you?

04:25:26.888 --> 04:25:28.975
TALIESIN: We're hoping.

04:25:28.975 --> 04:25:30.814
MATT: Ah!

04:25:30.814 --> 04:25:33.005
SAM: Hey! We're going to land right on him!

04:25:33.005 --> 04:25:34.523
MARISHA: Kill him!

04:25:34.523 --> 04:25:36.916
MATT: Go ahead and make acrobatics checks, you
guys.

04:25:36.916 --> 04:25:39.886
MARISHA: Kill him. With your bodies.

04:25:39.886 --> 04:25:40.797
LIAM: Terrible.

04:25:40.797 --> 04:25:41.587
SAM: 12.

04:25:41.587 --> 04:25:42.158
LIAM: Five.

04:25:42.158 --> 04:25:45.134
SAM: Acrobatics check or save?

04:25:45.134 --> 04:25:46.382
MATT: Acrobatics check.

04:25:46.382 --> 04:25:47.653
SAM: Oh, it's a 12. No, I was right.

04:25:47.653 --> 04:25:55.302
MATT: You both fall prone right on the sides of it
as you slam into the dragon-- onto the side--

04:25:55.302 --> 04:25:57.413
(groaning)-- on the ground.

04:25:57.413 --> 04:25:58.911
SAM: Did we cause some damage to the dragon?

04:25:58.911 --> 04:26:04.927
MATT: Not for dragon scales, unfortunately, but
you do both take five points of bludgeoning damage

04:26:04.927 --> 04:26:06.293
from the impact.

04:26:06.293 --> 04:26:07.078
SAM: Great.

04:26:07.373 --> 04:26:12.091
MATT: You're like-- (groaning). Both roll
initiative to see where you fall on the initiative order.

04:26:12.091 --> 04:26:13.657
SAM: Mmm, eight.

04:26:13.657 --> 04:26:14.718
LIAM: Seven.

04:26:14.718 --> 04:26:16.208
MATT: Eight? Okay.

04:26:16.208 --> 04:26:18.006
SAM: Caleb! What's going on?

04:26:18.006 --> 04:26:20.535
LAURA: You don't see anybody in there.

04:26:20.535 --> 04:26:23.517
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, there's nobody in there!

04:26:23.517 --> 04:26:33.329
MATT: You're in a chamber. You land there and you
see this angry, burning dragon and this tiny

04:26:33.329 --> 04:26:39.083
little version of the mage that you walked through
the den of and that's it. You see the glowing

04:26:39.083 --> 04:26:45.491
sphere here on the pedestal, these lines of energy
that meet in the center. The fire elemental in the

04:26:45.491 --> 04:26:53.278
back way, burning. You're Troy in Community
walking in with the pizzas.

04:26:53.278 --> 04:26:57.776
LIAM: Minor question. Do I smell burnt ozone,
since you said that just a second ago?

04:26:57.776 --> 04:27:00.868
MATT: You do smell the electrical remainder in the
air.

04:27:00.868 --> 04:27:02.085
LIAM: Good enough.

04:27:02.085 --> 04:27:05.826
MARISHA: Who saw me bamf out by touching the
thing? Jes for sure did.

04:27:05.826 --> 04:27:06.888
DEBORAH: I saw it.

04:27:06.888 --> 04:27:08.754
MARISHA: And Fjord? Okay.

04:27:08.754 --> 04:27:10.433
MATT: Caduceus, you're up.

04:27:10.433 --> 04:27:15.335
TALIESIN: Oh boy, I'm going to-- oh fuck, she's
not there, is she?

04:27:15.335 --> 04:27:17.358
DEBORAH: Do they need to roll into initiative?

04:27:17.358 --> 04:27:18.491
MATT: They already rolled initiative.

04:27:18.491 --> 04:27:20.296
DEBORAH: Oh, they already did. Okay, I didn't
catch it. You rolled badly? Oh no.

04:27:20.296 --> 04:27:24.022
TALIESIN: I'm going to come out of the wall.

04:27:24.022 --> 04:27:26.524
MATT: Okay.

04:27:26.524 --> 04:27:39.112
TALIESIN: I see them. Hmm? Yeah, no, and I'm going
to do the: We're running! It's bad! I'm going to--

04:27:39.650 --> 04:27:41.123
TRAVIS: It's bad!

04:27:41.123 --> 04:27:44.844
(laughter)

04:27:44.844 --> 04:27:51.772
TRAVIS: Oh my god, that's amazing! (flapping)
We're running, it's bad!

04:27:51.772 --> 04:27:58.164
(laughter)

04:27:58.164 --> 04:28:04.316
MATT: What are you doing Caduceus? You shout that
as you're stepping out of the wall. "We're

04:28:04.405 --> 04:28:06.780
"running, it's bad."

04:28:06.780 --> 04:28:09.014
SAM: Oh my god.

04:28:09.014 --> 04:28:10.967
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck.

04:28:10.967 --> 04:28:13.373
TALIESIN: I am going to--

04:28:13.373 --> 04:28:17.959
MATT: You're on deck, Fjord.

04:28:17.959 --> 04:28:22.270
TRAVIS: Walks out of the wall.

04:28:22.270 --> 04:28:25.927
MARISHA: They didn't run.

04:28:25.927 --> 04:28:31.610
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my action since there's
no one to heal-- ah!

04:28:31.610 --> 04:28:32.746
DEBORAH and MARISHA: Ah!

04:28:32.746 --> 04:28:39.829
TALIESIN: Which is really frustrating, and there's
not a lot I can do. I am going to-- fuck, man,

04:28:39.829 --> 04:28:43.273
this is such a bad call.

04:28:43.273 --> 04:28:44.611
MATT: What are you doing?

04:28:44.611 --> 04:28:48.668
TALIESIN: I am going to cast-- so sorry, I'm doing
this weirdly--

04:28:48.668 --> 04:28:51.371
MATT: It's all good.

04:28:51.371 --> 04:28:59.037
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast-- where is it? Goddamn
it, where did it go? I'm going to cast Blindness

04:28:59.037 --> 04:29:02.031
on the dragon.

04:29:02.031 --> 04:29:03.042
LAURA: Yeah.

04:29:03.042 --> 04:29:05.740
MATT: All right. What's the saving throw on it?

04:29:05.740 --> 04:29:08.393
TALIESIN: It's a 16 constitution with a negative
d4.

04:29:08.393 --> 04:29:11.473
MATT: Okay. Is Blindness concentration?

04:29:11.473 --> 04:29:15.177
TALIESIN: Oh wait, I can't do that actually, never
mind. It's not, but I can't do it because I don't

04:29:15.177 --> 04:29:20.536
have any 3rd-level spells left. Oh, it's a
2nd-level! I'm a crazy person, yes. It's not a

04:29:20.536 --> 04:29:22.434
concentration spell.

04:29:22.434 --> 04:29:27.829
MATT: It would be a three plus four-- it's a plus
four con save, so it's a 17 minus four from the

04:29:27.829 --> 04:29:30.384
Bane, so it's 13. Yeah, it's blind.

04:29:30.384 --> 04:29:35.021
TRAVIS: Oh, you fucking crazy goth genius!

04:29:35.021 --> 04:29:39.179
TALIESIN: You are blind for a minute. I'm going to
take the rest of my movement and hop into the

04:29:39.179 --> 04:29:40.636
fucking orb.

04:29:40.636 --> 04:29:41.566
TRAVIS: Yes you do!

04:29:41.566 --> 04:29:46.603
MATT: You move up. The Bane fades.

04:29:46.603 --> 04:29:48.093
TALIESIN: The Bane does fade.

04:29:48.093 --> 04:29:49.539
MATT and TALIESIN: The Blindness stays.

04:29:49.539 --> 04:29:52.308
MATT: All right, that ends Caduceus' turn. Fjord,
you're up.

04:29:52.308 --> 04:30:00.621
TRAVIS: I pop back into existence ten feet. I want
to stay out of his melee.

04:30:00.621 --> 04:30:04.592
MATT: So there. All righty.

04:30:04.592 --> 04:30:07.555
SAM: Did Caleb and Nott see that? Do we make a check of
any kind?

04:30:07.555 --> 04:30:09.533
MARISHA: You had to have seen Caduceus.

04:30:09.803 --> 04:30:14.303
TALIESIN: I made sure you saw it. I was yelling at
you and making a fuss.

04:30:14.303 --> 04:30:20.194
MARISHA: He said, "We're running; it's bad," and
then jumped into a sphere. That's some children's

04:30:20.194 --> 04:30:23.044
cartoon-level obvious.

04:30:23.044 --> 04:30:27.572
TRAVIS: Yeah, and I'll use my extra language to
go: Yeah, it's bad. Grab the sphere! I'll use my

04:30:27.572 --> 04:30:35.448
full movement to run towards the sphere. If it
will put me in his melee-- will it?

04:30:35.448 --> 04:30:40.771
MATT: He has reach with his bite. He has that
entire hallway covered.

04:30:40.771 --> 04:30:46.896
TRAVIS: I will use my bonus action Misty Step with
the sword to (poof) over to the globe.

04:30:46.896 --> 04:30:49.051
MARISHA: Yas, queen!

04:30:49.051 --> 04:30:51.827
MATT: That will put you at 30, right there.

04:30:51.827 --> 04:30:54.037
TRAVIS: I will reach out and touch someone.

04:30:54.037 --> 04:30:59.718
MATT: Fjord is out. At the top of your turn,
because you're still on fire, you do take four

04:30:59.718 --> 04:31:01.062
points of fire damage.

04:31:01.062 --> 04:31:02.141
TRAVIS: Okay.

04:31:02.141 --> 04:31:03.191
TALIESIN: Are you okay?

04:31:03.191 --> 04:31:04.769
LAURA: Mm-mm.

04:31:04.769 --> 04:31:08.263
SAM: No, she's not okay. She's been abandoned by
everyone who can help her.

04:31:08.263 --> 04:31:11.530
MATT: That's the end of Fjord's turn. It's your
turn.

04:31:11.530 --> 04:31:20.446
DEBORAH: I stand up again. I still look like
little Halas, but as Twiggy, I reach in my pouch

04:31:20.446 --> 04:31:26.651
again and pull out the tongue of a snake. As I do
that, I have in my palm a little bit of oil, and I

04:31:26.651 --> 04:31:33.189
run it back and forth on it. Then I throw it out
this way, and as I do that, I say: Wait until

04:31:33.189 --> 04:31:36.509
we've left. I try Suggestion.

04:31:36.509 --> 04:31:38.642
LIAM: Oh yes.

04:31:38.642 --> 04:31:42.792
DEBORAH: Wisdom saving throw. I'm sure it's very
wise.

04:31:42.792 --> 04:31:49.569
MATT: Wisdom saving throw. No, that's cocked. It's
a 19, unfortunately. Good try.

04:31:49.569 --> 04:31:52.562
DEBORAH: The little snake tongue falls on the
ground.

04:31:52.562 --> 04:31:58.888
MATT: (small impact) The dragon hears you speaking
and looks in your direction. But where the pale

04:31:58.888 --> 04:32:06.775
blue, piercing eyes were is just a cloud of black.
It is trying to sniff for where you might be.

04:32:06.775 --> 04:32:10.524
DEBORAH: For all intents and purposes, I'm already
hidden; I don't need to hide again, if it's

04:32:10.524 --> 04:32:12.022
already blind?

04:32:12.022 --> 04:32:13.255
MATT: In theory, yes.

04:32:13.255 --> 04:32:15.077
DEBORAH: In theory, yes, unless it's able to sense
me.

04:32:15.077 --> 04:32:16.276
MATT: Yes, it does not have tremorsense.

04:32:16.276 --> 04:32:20.227
DEBORAH: Okay! I still yell: Hey, guys--

04:32:20.227 --> 04:32:22.587
MATT: It does have blindsight to 30 feet, I just
noticed.

04:32:22.587 --> 04:32:36.052
DEBORAH: Oh! Then I do hide. I attempt to hide.
That's really good. That is a 25. But before I

04:32:36.052 --> 04:32:40.072
hide, I do yell: Touch the globe! Touch the
sphere!

04:32:40.317 --> 04:32:42.452
SAM: Thank you, Halas.

04:32:42.452 --> 04:32:43.477
MATT: You stay hidden?

04:32:43.477 --> 04:32:44.608
DEBORAH: I stay hidden over there.

04:32:44.608 --> 04:32:47.777
MATT: Okay, you got it. You move into the back
area.

04:32:47.777 --> 04:32:49.024
DEBORAH: Yeah, exactly.

04:32:49.024 --> 04:32:50.968
MATT: Got it. Okay, that ends Twiggy's turn. Fire
elemental!

04:32:50.968 --> 04:32:54.650
MARISHA: I'm a dummy!

04:32:54.650 --> 04:33:00.684
MATT: It's going to-- Nott, roll a d6. On a one to
three, it attacks you. On a four to six, it

04:33:00.684 --> 04:33:02.288
attacks the dragon.

04:33:02.288 --> 04:33:03.216
SAM: One.

04:33:03.216 --> 04:33:09.595
MATT: Yeah. With advantage because you're on the
ground. That is a 17.

04:33:09.595 --> 04:33:11.083
SAM: Hits.

04:33:11.083 --> 04:33:14.579
MATT: And a 16.

04:33:14.579 --> 04:33:16.558
SAM: That's my armor class.

04:33:16.558 --> 04:33:27.899
MATT: Yeah, they both hit. You take eight points
of fire damage, and you're on fire.

04:33:27.899 --> 04:33:31.299
SAM: I'll use Uncanny Dodge for, I guess, that
one.

04:33:31.299 --> 04:33:35.615
MATT: Okay, so you take four points of fire
damage. The second attack does nine points of fire

04:33:35.615 --> 04:33:41.371
damage to you. That ends the fire elemental's
turn. Nott, you're up.

04:33:41.371 --> 04:33:50.093
SAM: Lying on the ground, I will fire up at the
dragon with my crossbow, trying to quickly load

04:33:50.093 --> 04:33:55.841
one of my explosive charges. He's within five feet
of a friend, yes?

04:33:55.841 --> 04:33:57.919
MATT: He's within five feet of all of you.

04:33:57.919 --> 04:34:00.225
SAM: So it's a sneak attack?

04:34:00.225 --> 04:34:04.224
MATT: It's a sneak attack. Just letting you know,
it's an explosive arrow, and you're adjacent to

04:34:04.224 --> 04:34:05.260
the creature.

04:34:05.260 --> 04:34:06.775
SAM: Sure. Yeah, I'm going for its head.

04:34:06.775 --> 04:34:08.006
MATT: Go for it!

04:34:08.006 --> 04:34:12.894
SAM: Oh boy, that's not great. 18.

04:34:12.894 --> 04:34:14.582
MATT: 18 just hits.

04:34:14.582 --> 04:34:16.893
SAM: Okay.

04:34:16.893 --> 04:34:25.282
MATT: You're prone, so you have disadvantage on
attack rolls, by the way. So you do have to roll again.

04:34:25.801 --> 04:34:27.669
SAM: Shit. Well, can I stand up first?

04:34:27.669 --> 04:34:31.728
MATT: We'll say you stand up. That's half your
movement there.

04:34:31.728 --> 04:34:41.033
SAM: 18, plus whatever the explosion does.

04:34:41.033 --> 04:34:47.968
MATT: The arrow detonates from inside, creating a
fiery explosion in a ten-foot radius around the

04:34:47.968 --> 04:34:51.804
creature that affects you, Caleb, and the fire
elemental. The fire elemental is immune to fire;

04:34:51.804 --> 04:34:56.349
it takes no damage. The dragon, however-- will you
roll 3d6?

04:34:56.349 --> 04:34:57.975
SAM: 3d6?

04:34:57.975 --> 04:35:01.262
MATT: It has to make a dexterity saving throw.
Actually, it does not because it was hit by it.

04:35:01.262 --> 04:35:02.360
SAM: 11.

04:35:02.360 --> 04:35:06.826
MATT: It takes an additional 11 points of fire
damage. Then I need both Caleb and you to roll

04:35:06.826 --> 04:35:09.673
dexterity saving throws.

04:35:09.673 --> 04:35:12.024
LIAM: Four.

04:35:12.024 --> 04:35:13.401
MATT: So you take 11 points of fire damage.

04:35:13.401 --> 04:35:14.233
SAM: 23.

04:35:14.233 --> 04:35:19.354
MATT: You take none because of your evasion. You
roll out of the way (dull explosion). Caleb's

04:35:19.354 --> 04:35:20.928
like, "Ah!"

04:35:20.928 --> 04:35:24.836
SAM: Okay. He's still alive.

04:35:24.836 --> 04:35:26.429
MATT: Still alive.

04:35:26.429 --> 04:35:27.844
SAM: I use half my movement to get up.

04:35:27.844 --> 04:35:31.842
MATT: Correct. You still have a bonus action and
half your movement.

04:35:31.898 --> 04:35:34.033
SAM: I use my bonus action to fire again.

04:35:34.033 --> 04:35:35.741
MATT: Okay, go for it.

04:35:35.741 --> 04:35:37.235
SAM: Natural fucking one!

04:35:37.235 --> 04:35:38.644
LAURA: No!

04:35:38.644 --> 04:35:40.029
MATT: So...

04:35:40.029 --> 04:35:42.155
SAM: Oh. What does that do?

04:35:42.155 --> 04:35:45.205
MATT: You have to make an attack roll against
yourself, don't you? For your weapon?

04:35:45.205 --> 04:35:48.604
SAM: I don't know how this works. If you roll a
one-- I've never done this before-- on a d20

04:35:48.604 --> 04:35:57.416
attack you must succeed in a dexterity saving
throw-- which I <i>don't</i>, or suffer 1d6 piercing

04:35:57.416 --> 04:36:00.901
damage to myself. It's two.

04:36:00.901 --> 04:36:06.326
MATT: As you go to fire a second round, you pull
back and shoot and the mechanism misfires slightly

04:36:06.326 --> 04:36:10.479
and all of a sudden it scrapes you on the side of
the cheek and you're like, "Ah!"

04:36:10.479 --> 04:36:12.760
SAM: Damn it. Okay.

04:36:12.760 --> 04:36:15.546
MATT: Okay. You still have your movement if you
wanted to move.

04:36:15.546 --> 04:36:21.534
SAM: No, because it'll hit me. I mean, I guess
it'll hit me anyway, right?

04:36:21.534 --> 04:36:24.657
MATT: I mean, you can still move within its melee
if you wanted to try and re-maneuver.

04:36:24.657 --> 04:36:28.602
SAM: Okay, I'll walk around away from the fire
guy.

04:36:28.602 --> 04:36:32.365
MATT: Okay. There you go. The fire guy does get an
attack against you.

04:36:32.365 --> 04:36:33.913
SAM: Okay.

04:36:33.913 --> 04:36:36.223
MATT: That is a 12. I don't think that hits you.

04:36:36.223 --> 04:36:37.355
SAM: No.

04:36:37.355 --> 04:36:40.225
MATT: You just manage to avoid it. Okay. Caleb,
you're up.

04:36:40.225 --> 04:36:42.915
LIAM: Fuck. I don't see Jester; she's not here.

04:36:42.915 --> 04:36:44.279
SAM: Well, she left already.

04:36:44.279 --> 04:36:46.480
LIAM: I don't see Twiggy. I heard her voice.

04:36:46.480 --> 04:36:47.286
MATT: Yep.

04:36:47.286 --> 04:36:48.291
LIAM: Nott is up.

04:36:48.291 --> 04:36:49.027
MATT: Yeah.

04:36:49.027 --> 04:36:50.485
LIAM: There is a dragon.

04:36:50.485 --> 04:36:55.131
MATT: Mm-hmm. A dragon that looks hurt, but not
death's door.

04:36:55.131 --> 04:36:57.215
DEBORAH: And a fire elemental.

04:36:57.215 --> 04:36:59.411
MATT: And a fire elemental that is burning
angrily.

04:36:59.411 --> 04:37:01.133
TRAVIS: It's the worst playroom ever.

04:37:01.133 --> 04:37:03.018
SAM: I'm half.

04:37:03.018 --> 04:37:11.355
LIAM: I'm going to cast Expeditious Retreat and
since that is transmutation-- and I smell the

04:37:11.355 --> 04:37:16.097
ozone as soon as I hit the ground-- I am going to
make my Transmuter's Stone make me resistant to lightning.

04:37:16.666 --> 04:37:19.623
MATT: Good call. Okay.

04:37:19.623 --> 04:37:22.053
LIAM: I am going to beeline for the sphere.

04:37:22.053 --> 04:37:23.338
MATT: All right.

04:37:23.338 --> 04:37:26.732
SAM: Caleb, wait for--! Oh, okay. Bye.

04:37:26.732 --> 04:37:29.268
LIAM: Fuck.

04:37:29.268 --> 04:37:33.691
MATT: All right. That brings us to Jester's turn.

04:37:33.691 --> 04:37:34.964
MARISHA: Get out, Jes.

04:37:34.964 --> 04:37:36.484
MATT: Jester.

04:37:36.484 --> 04:37:40.480
LAURA: Oh, I can be ten feet away. I can be ten
feet.

04:37:40.480 --> 04:37:41.599
MATT: Ten feet. That's right.

04:37:41.599 --> 04:37:41.931
TRAVIS: And you can choose.

04:37:41.931 --> 04:37:47.097
LAURA: I mean-- within ten feet, can I get away
from the fire elemental at least?

04:37:47.097 --> 04:37:54.633
MATT: Unfortunately, no. He's placed in a way
where-- I mean, you can. You can go-- oh god!

04:37:54.633 --> 04:37:56.667
LAURA: Oh, I killed him, yay! Everything's fine.

04:37:56.667 --> 04:37:58.688
SAM: You can go farther down the hall or
something?

04:37:58.688 --> 04:38:02.682
MATT: You can go there. That way, the fire
elemental is not within range, and technically the

04:38:02.682 --> 04:38:06.638
dragon-- you're just out of the dragon's range,
although you're going to pass it running.

04:38:06.638 --> 04:38:08.927
LAURA: But I wouldn't-- yeah.

04:38:08.927 --> 04:38:13.385
MATT: You also take one point of fire damage at
the top of the round because you're still on fire.

04:38:14.349 --> 04:38:19.255
LAURA: Okay. I mean, this is so stupid. I'm going
to cast Cure Wounds on myself because I'm going to

04:38:19.255 --> 04:38:27.029
die if I don't, at, I guess-- a couple of
3rd-levels left, so I'm going to cast Cure Wounds.

04:38:29.037 --> 04:38:35.463
Oh good! Two ones and a two. That's great. So four
plus four is eight points healed.

04:38:35.463 --> 04:38:37.248
SAM: Very valuable.

04:38:37.248 --> 04:38:38.476
LAURA: Sure.

04:38:38.476 --> 04:38:43.959
MARISHA: You've got to run. Just run.

04:38:43.959 --> 04:38:46.715
DEBORAH: Dash and take it? Oh, you need a
distraction.

04:38:46.715 --> 04:38:48.288
MARISHA: Run and pray?

04:38:48.288 --> 04:38:52.249
LAURA: I mean, yeah. I'm going to run around as
much as I can.

04:38:52.249 --> 04:38:54.627
MATT: Okay. I mean, there's no way to--

04:38:54.627 --> 04:38:58.298
LAURA: Around the edge of-- without getting hit,
without me leaving his melee.

04:38:58.298 --> 04:39:05.535
MATT: Yeah, so (counting) 30, you can get to.

04:39:05.535 --> 04:39:07.416
LAURA: Then Blink.

04:39:07.416 --> 04:39:08.785
MATT: Roll for your d20.

04:39:08.785 --> 04:39:10.925
TALIESIN: Oh god, come on.

04:39:14.658 --> 04:39:16.771
LAURA: No. I stay.

04:39:16.771 --> 04:39:20.019
MATT: Jester remains. It's now the dragon's turn.

04:39:20.019 --> 04:39:23.449
TALIESIN: God fucking damn it.

04:39:23.449 --> 04:39:29.377
MATT: It does not regain his lightning breath.
That's good. He's going to go ahead and take three attacks.

04:39:29.943 --> 04:39:32.844
LIAM and SAM: Is he blind?

04:39:32.844 --> 04:39:34.539
MATT: He has blindsight within 30 feet.

04:39:34.539 --> 04:39:36.705
LIAM: Oh. Okay. Yeah, we self-corrected already.

04:39:36.705 --> 04:39:44.447
MATT: Yeah. That's going to be...all right. Yeah,
it's going to be a claw attack on each of you. A

04:39:44.447 --> 04:39:52.762
claw attack against Nott. That's going to be an
eight plus nine, 17?

04:39:52.762 --> 04:39:54.643
SAM: Sure, hits.

04:39:54.643 --> 04:40:00.459
MATT: You take ten points of slashing damage.

04:40:00.459 --> 04:40:06.899
SAM: Okay. I've gone since my last one, so I'll
dodge.

04:40:06.899 --> 04:40:12.023
MATT: Got that, okay. Against Jester, that is a
natural four plus nine; that is a 13 to hit.

04:40:12.023 --> 04:40:14.044
TALIESIN: Oh my god!

04:40:14.044 --> 04:40:19.983
MATT: You deflect it, and it doesn't care much for
Nott necessarily. You've been a threat; it's going

04:40:19.983 --> 04:40:22.541
to go after you, Jester. I'm sorry.

04:40:22.541 --> 04:40:24.076
LAURA: No, it's fine.

04:40:24.076 --> 04:40:34.215
MATT: Natural two. Not even joking. I was looking
at it-- we're not out of the woods yet. As it

04:40:34.215 --> 04:40:41.198
strikes both towards you, there's that moment of
quiet where your eyes close and you're waiting for

04:40:41.198 --> 04:40:47.099
the imminent moment and you hear this voice creep
in your head and go, "Don't worry, I'm watching."

04:40:47.099 --> 04:40:52.868
Your arm-- without even noticing-- you feel a hand
push your wrist and the shield goes up and

04:40:52.868 --> 04:41:00.361
deflects the impact. The teeth streak across it
and cling to it and begin to try to pull the

04:41:00.361 --> 04:41:05.770
shield away and you instinctually muscle it away.
As you do, you watch two teeth shatter and fall to

04:41:05.770 --> 04:41:13.942
the ground in front, that moment of strength
billowing up inside a pretty strong cleric. That's

04:41:13.942 --> 04:41:19.773
the end of the dragon's turn. Caduceus is done,
Fjord is done, and Twiggy.

04:41:19.773 --> 04:41:24.386
SAM: Twiggy, fucking kill this dragon or get us
out of here! Do something!

04:41:24.386 --> 04:41:26.651
LIAM: Mercy kill Jester!

04:41:26.651 --> 04:41:28.568
TRAVIS: Mercy kill.

04:41:28.568 --> 04:41:31.706
MATT: This is the turn, this is the moment.

04:41:31.706 --> 04:41:35.787
TRAVIS: We are best friends.

04:41:35.787 --> 04:41:38.393
SAM: Is the dragon looking at all rough or not
really?

04:41:38.393 --> 04:41:43.786
MATT: It's looking pretty hurt. That's as much as
I can tell you.

04:41:43.786 --> 04:41:46.670
DEBORAH: I'm hidden well, so I have advantage?

04:41:46.670 --> 04:41:48.140
MATT: Yes.

04:41:48.140 --> 04:41:56.883
DEBORAH: Okay. Arrow, snipe it with an arrow. I
come out and I say: You leave my friends alone!

04:41:56.883 --> 04:42:00.206
and I shoot my arrow.

04:42:00.206 --> 04:42:01.708
SAM: Why does Halas like us?

04:42:01.708 --> 04:42:04.946
DEBORAH: 17 plus seven.

04:42:04.946 --> 04:42:08.449
MATT: That hits, roll damage. With sneak attack.

04:42:08.449 --> 04:42:10.043
LAURA: He's so much cuter than I thought he was.

04:42:10.043 --> 04:42:10.712
SAM: And it's way shorter.

04:42:10.712 --> 04:42:20.021
DEBORAH: Seven on the hit and then with sneak,
another seven's 14, another six is 20 on that. 20

04:42:20.021 --> 04:42:22.019
points of damage.

04:42:22.019 --> 04:42:27.417
MATT: Into its throat. You watch it reach up and
with its claw scrape the arrow out of the throat

04:42:27.417 --> 04:42:32.382
and as it does you see a little bit of electricity
arc out from the wound. It's looking pretty hurt.

04:42:32.382 --> 04:42:42.890
DEBORAH: Okay. I'm saying: Save yourselves! and I
attempt to hide again. 19 plus seven.

04:42:42.890 --> 04:42:52.336
MATT: You stealth into your old campaign. That
ends your turn, Twiggy. The fire elemental's turn.

04:42:52.336 --> 04:43:00.147
First, the fire elemental is going to roll against
the dragon, which is the closest enemy currently.

04:43:00.147 --> 04:43:09.261
Natural two, that's a miss. Natural eight. Yeah,
it misses both strikes. It's going to shift around

04:43:09.261 --> 04:43:19.830
to this way. That ends his turn. Nott, you're up.
At the beginning of your turn, you take six points

04:43:19.830 --> 04:43:21.264
of fire damage.

04:43:21.264 --> 04:43:24.211
TRAVIS: My heart rate is literally like I've been
running two miles.

04:43:24.211 --> 04:43:27.955
LAURA: His blindsight; he can see anything within
30 feet?

04:43:27.955 --> 04:43:29.939
MATT: Within 30 feet, he can see through
blindness.

04:43:29.939 --> 04:43:31.643
SAM: It's Nott's turn, not Jester's turn.

04:43:31.643 --> 04:43:33.388
MATT: Correct, it's Nott's turn.

04:43:33.388 --> 04:43:37.510
LAURA: Just go.

04:43:40.334 --> 04:43:44.400
SAM: I will run towards the exit.

04:43:44.400 --> 04:43:46.357
MATT: Okay. Are you disengaging?

04:43:46.357 --> 04:43:47.267
SAM: No.

04:43:47.267 --> 04:43:48.028
MATT: Okay.

04:43:48.028 --> 04:43:48.717
LAURA: What?

04:43:48.717 --> 04:43:49.671
DEBORAH: You can as an action.

04:43:49.671 --> 04:43:50.530
LAURA: Disengage!

04:43:50.530 --> 04:43:51.846
TALIESIN and SAM: No.

04:43:51.846 --> 04:43:52.917
DEBORAH: Or as a bonus action.

04:43:52.917 --> 04:43:57.169
MATT: Going to run to the front; it makes an
attack of opportunity against you. That's going to

04:43:57.169 --> 04:44:05.861
hit. That's a 15 plus nine, yeah, it's 24. It's
going to be a bite attack against you, which does

04:44:05.861 --> 04:44:12.333
more damage. That's going to be 18 points of
piercing damage.

04:44:12.333 --> 04:44:14.716
SAM: Mm-hmm. I'm okay.

04:44:14.716 --> 04:44:19.274
MATT: The jaws bite into you and you feel it rake
across your shoulder, but you manage to pull out,

04:44:19.274 --> 04:44:23.665
roll on the ground to back up and you manage to
get your arm up and pull yourself onto the

04:44:23.665 --> 04:44:26.150
platform where the orb is still glowing that dull
green color.

04:44:26.150 --> 04:44:30.322
SAM: I'll turn around and fire my crossbow at the
thing.

04:44:30.322 --> 04:44:32.038
MATT: Go for it.

04:44:32.038 --> 04:44:35.853
SAM: It's not great. It's only a 16.

04:44:35.853 --> 04:44:41.499
MATT: The bolt ricochets off of the hard scales of
the dragon's hide.

04:44:41.499 --> 04:44:45.974
SAM: If I use my bonus action to fire again, I
can't touch the thing, right?

04:44:45.974 --> 04:44:48.809
LAURA: Just go.

04:44:48.809 --> 04:44:50.356
MATT: What are you doing, man?

04:44:50.356 --> 04:44:56.145
TRAVIS: Get the fuck out. You've done enough. You
did enough! Don't do it!

04:44:56.145 --> 04:44:58.397
MARISHA: She can go now if he uses his reaction.

04:44:58.397 --> 04:45:01.358
LAURA: Go!

04:45:01.358 --> 04:45:02.493
SAM: I'll go.

04:45:08.682 --> 04:45:10.681
MARISHA: Jester's next, right?

04:45:10.681 --> 04:45:18.098
MATT: All right, Jester's turn. At the beginning
of your turn, you take fire damage. Six points of

04:45:18.098 --> 04:45:19.482
fire damage.

04:45:19.482 --> 04:45:20.657
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

04:45:20.657 --> 04:45:22.470
DEBORAH: It's only a ten. It's okay.

04:45:22.470 --> 04:45:26.687
LAURA: Okay. He used his reaction, right?

04:45:26.687 --> 04:45:30.402
MATT: He did. Jester's out.

04:45:30.402 --> 04:45:32.360
(groans of relief)

04:45:32.360 --> 04:45:33.530
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

04:45:33.530 --> 04:45:34.830
TALIESIN: Fuck!

04:45:34.830 --> 04:45:37.505
MATT: Dragon's turn.

04:45:37.505 --> 04:45:39.366
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Is that a one?!

04:45:39.366 --> 04:45:41.544
SAM: Yeah, I got one hit point.

04:45:41.544 --> 04:45:45.218
MATT: (laughing) Holy shit!

04:45:45.218 --> 04:45:46.847
LAURA: One hit point.

04:45:46.847 --> 04:45:48.572
TRAVIS: You had one after the 18?

04:45:48.572 --> 04:45:51.717
SAM: Yeah.

04:45:52.283 --> 04:45:56.073
MATT: The dragon's going to wail on the elemental;
it can't see anything else around it. Let's see if

04:45:56.073 --> 04:45:59.092
it gets the-- Does not get its--

04:45:59.092 --> 04:46:01.811
TRAVIS: Please tell me the dragon can't touch the
sphere.

04:46:01.811 --> 04:46:11.709
MATT: That's a hit, and a hit, and a miss on the
jaws. That's seven damage for the elemental, if

04:46:11.709 --> 04:46:13.514
you want to keep track of this.

04:46:13.514 --> 04:46:15.361
MARISHA: Mm-hmm, and 40 hp.

04:46:15.361 --> 04:46:20.231
MATT: Ooh, double sixes. That's 17 points of
slashing damage to it.

04:46:20.231 --> 04:46:22.073
SAM: Get out of there!

04:46:22.073 --> 04:46:28.463
TRAVIS: The intro's been up one week. The
animation takes a long time!

04:46:28.463 --> 04:46:32.043
MATT: The dragon takes another six points from the
fire. The dragon's hurt real bad.

04:46:32.043 --> 04:46:33.026
TRAVIS: Who's hurting real bad?

04:46:33.026 --> 04:46:37.371
MATT: The dragon's hurt real bad. That's going to
end its turn, everyone else goes by-- Twiggy,

04:46:37.371 --> 04:46:38.352
you're up.

04:46:38.352 --> 04:46:39.758
DEBORAH: Am I, or is it the elemental who goes
first?

04:46:39.758 --> 04:46:41.131
MATT: You go before the elemental.

04:46:41.131 --> 04:46:45.572
DEBORAH: I go first? All right. I'm going to come
out of hiding. I'm going to fire an arrow with advantage.

04:46:46.017 --> 04:46:47.356
MATT: Go for it.

04:46:47.356 --> 04:46:48.845
MARISHA: Last man standing, Twiggy!

04:46:48.845 --> 04:46:49.625
DEBORAH: Natural 20!

04:46:49.625 --> 04:46:56.177
(screaming, cheering)

04:46:56.177 --> 04:47:03.412
MATT: Roll damage. We'll see if it's enough.

04:47:04.357 --> 04:47:06.165
DEBORAH: Nine plus four, for the hit.

04:47:06.165 --> 04:47:08.096
MATT: Okay, nine plus four, so 13.

04:47:08.096 --> 04:47:09.305
DEBORAH: 13--

04:47:09.305 --> 04:47:10.611
ALL: Double the dice!

04:47:10.611 --> 04:47:14.802
DEBORAH: I doubled the dice for the hit, that was
2d6 before-- so that's for the hit-- but I get 8d6

04:47:14.802 --> 04:47:16.474
on my sneak?

04:47:16.474 --> 04:47:17.678
LIAM: Double that sneak attack damage!

04:47:17.678 --> 04:47:19.356
MATT: You can either just roll the sneak attack
and then double the number, or roll twice as many

04:47:19.356 --> 04:47:22.590
dice, it's up to you.

04:47:22.590 --> 04:47:26.126
DEBORAH: That's nine. That's another ten is 19--

04:47:26.126 --> 04:47:27.717
LAURA: Double that!

04:47:27.717 --> 04:47:31.410
DEBORAH: Double that to 38.

04:47:31.410 --> 04:47:34.026
MATT: How do you want to do this?

04:47:34.026 --> 04:47:36.049
(cheering)

04:47:36.049 --> 04:47:37.808
LAURA: Oh my god! Why aren't we there? We can't
see them!

04:47:37.808 --> 04:47:39.416
DEBORAH: No one's going to see my moment of
triumph!

04:47:39.416 --> 04:47:40.677
LIAM: No one's going to believe her!

04:47:40.677 --> 04:47:42.119
TRAVIS: No, nobody--

04:47:42.119 --> 04:47:43.414
MATT: Quiet, shh.

04:47:43.414 --> 04:47:52.416
DEBORAH: I step out and I put on my meanest face
that I learned from Sir Cadigan, and--

04:47:52.634 --> 04:47:54.161
MATT: Still in the form?

04:47:54.161 --> 04:48:03.981
DEBORAH: Still as Halas, hundred percent as
Halas-- and I say: This is for my only friends!

04:48:03.981 --> 04:48:16.048
Come straight forward, and I want to hit him in
the heart because he broke my heart.

04:48:16.048 --> 04:48:21.356
MATT: (heavy breathing and steps) It stumbles
forward towards you now that you're visible, its

04:48:21.356 --> 04:48:25.712
eyes blinking in and out, looking confused, still,
with the shape, and goes--

04:48:25.712 --> 04:48:28.190
DEBORAH: Now I drop it.

04:48:28.190 --> 04:48:39.984
MATT: (low chuckling, impact) And falls to the
ground and collapses, exhaling, bits of energy arc

04:48:39.984 --> 04:48:42.668
out of its snout and dissipate into the stone
around there. The dragon is dead.

04:48:42.668 --> 04:48:46.529
DEBORAH: Cool. There's still a fire elemental,
right?

04:48:46.529 --> 04:48:48.158
MATT: Yup. (roaring flame)

04:48:48.158 --> 04:48:50.720
LIAM: Fist fight.

04:48:50.720 --> 04:48:57.478
DEBORAH: Bonus action: is there a piece of tooth
in reach? I'd like to take a tooth with me, a

04:48:57.478 --> 04:48:59.331
dragon tooth.

04:48:59.331 --> 04:49:02.219
MATT: You can, but it's either that or touch the
sphere.

04:49:02.219 --> 04:49:03.489
DEBORAH: Okay, I'll touch the sphere.

04:49:03.489 --> 04:49:05.797
(laughter)

04:49:05.797 --> 04:49:07.156
SAM: I mean, I'm not crazy!

04:49:07.156 --> 04:49:09.212
DEBORAH: You said two fell on the ground, I
thought--

04:49:09.212 --> 04:49:13.908
MATT: They did. They're scattered over in this
corner. It'd be a move, grab it, and then go.

04:49:13.908 --> 04:49:15.904
DEBORAH: Okay, I'm gone. We're good.

04:49:15.904 --> 04:49:19.976
MATT: Okay. (exhales)

04:49:19.976 --> 04:49:22.769
TRAVIS: What are the rules of drinking hard liquor
on Twitch?

04:49:22.769 --> 04:49:27.034
TALIESIN: I am ready with stabilization magic for
everybody. Everybody's going to be fine!

04:49:27.034 --> 04:49:30.783
MARISHA: How many hit points did you have?

04:49:30.783 --> 04:49:34.160
LAURA: By the end I had 13, but if he had hit me
one more time--

04:49:34.160 --> 04:49:35.473
MARISHA: You would have been gone.

04:49:35.473 --> 04:49:36.120
LAURA: Yeah.

04:49:36.120 --> 04:49:38.730
TRAVIS: Nott, you took that with 19 hit points?

04:49:38.730 --> 04:49:41.853
LIAM: To burn the reaction, yeah.

04:49:41.853 --> 04:49:43.162
MARISHA: To get the reaction, yeah.

04:49:43.162 --> 04:49:43.933
TALIESIN: She could have grabbed him, worst case
scenario.

04:49:43.933 --> 04:49:47.411
MARISHA: That was Nott, the Bravest.

04:49:47.411 --> 04:49:50.360
LAURA: That was Nott, the Brave.

04:49:50.360 --> 04:49:54.410
MATT: As you all, one by one, emerge, beaten, on
fire--

04:49:54.410 --> 04:49:55.917
SAM: Jesus.

04:49:55.917 --> 04:50:02.954
MATT: Help put it out, for those who are still
burning in flames, you find yourselves back in the

04:50:02.954 --> 04:50:12.346
hull of the ship. You see the crew, half of the
crew is sitting there, looking intense, the sphere

04:50:12.346 --> 04:50:16.412
resting on the center of one of the tables off to
the side, and as soon as the first of you emerge,

04:50:16.412 --> 04:50:21.189
they're like, (starts) "Where have you been?!
What's going on?" Orly pushes forward and goes,

04:50:21.189 --> 04:50:31.260
"Where all you been hanging?" (whooshing) A few
more appear. (impacts) Eventually, everyone makes

04:50:31.260 --> 04:50:32.347
their way out of the sphere.

04:50:32.347 --> 04:50:35.721
DEBORAH: You guys, I did it! I killed the dragon
all by myself!

04:50:35.721 --> 04:50:37.038
MARISHA and SAM: What?

04:50:37.038 --> 04:50:39.216
SAM: No, the dragon was alive, we just left.

04:50:39.216 --> 04:50:40.609
DEBORAH: Aww, man.

04:50:40.609 --> 04:50:44.673
(laughter)

04:50:44.673 --> 04:50:46.276
SAM: Did you really?

04:50:46.276 --> 04:50:47.661
DEBORAH: I really did.

04:50:47.661 --> 04:50:49.338
MARISHA: Aww, Jessie...

04:50:49.338 --> 04:50:51.978
TRAVIS: Yeah, roll that shit, Caduceus.

04:50:51.978 --> 04:50:59.665
TALIESIN: Goddamn. Way to go, that's-- Did you get
anything from him?

04:50:59.665 --> 04:51:03.411
DEBORAH: I really tried to take a tooth, but I
figured it'd be better to live.

04:51:03.411 --> 04:51:05.109
TALIESIN: Yeah, aw man.

04:51:05.109 --> 04:51:08.422
MATT: You hear a clattering sound, and you glance
down and you see, stuck in the side of your boot,

04:51:08.422 --> 04:51:10.353
what looks like one of the errant dragon tooths.

04:51:10.353 --> 04:51:12.471
(cheering)

04:51:12.471 --> 04:51:16.721
DEBORAH: I take it and I put it in my bag, and I
go: This'll be good for later.

04:51:16.721 --> 04:51:23.419
SAM: I'm going to go over to Jester and take the
flower out of her head and be like: I think it

04:51:23.419 --> 04:51:25.935
worked. I'm going to take it back now.

04:51:25.935 --> 04:51:31.837
LAURA: I turn and give Nott the biggest hug, just
bury my head in her.

04:51:31.837 --> 04:51:35.523
MATT: Marius is like, "We've been waiting here for
seven days."

04:51:35.523 --> 04:51:36.657
SAM: Oh, shit.

04:51:36.657 --> 04:51:38.976
MARISHA: What?! Are you serious?

04:51:38.976 --> 04:51:40.211
MATT: "Yeah!"

04:51:40.211 --> 04:51:42.796
TRAVIS: Where are we?

04:51:42.796 --> 04:51:49.228
MATT: "We're at Bisaft. Our repairs finished like
a day ago and we haven't paid yet because you've

04:51:49.313 --> 04:51:53.944
"been fucking gone! The Dockmaster's not happy!"

04:51:53.944 --> 04:51:58.096
DEBORAH: Is the Ball of Fun there?

04:51:58.096 --> 04:52:01.460
MATT: Yeah, it's sitting on a table. They've all
been rallied around it, trying to figure out-- You

04:52:01.460 --> 04:52:03.661
guys vanished, and this was all that was left.

04:52:03.661 --> 04:52:05.898
TALIESIN: I wouldn't touch that. That's a lot.

04:52:05.898 --> 04:52:07.289
MATT: "We figured that was the case!"

04:52:07.289 --> 04:52:08.612
TALIESIN: Yeah.

04:52:08.612 --> 04:52:11.584
LAURA: It's probably safe to touch now, I mean,
the dragon's dead.

04:52:11.584 --> 04:52:17.666
TRAVIS: Marius, do me a favor. Just tell us how
much repairs cost and let's all settle in for the

04:52:17.666 --> 04:52:21.851
night. We're going to-- Still on fire.

04:52:21.851 --> 04:52:22.965
MARISHA: Sorry.

04:52:22.965 --> 04:52:24.261
TRAVIS: We're going to need it.

04:52:24.261 --> 04:52:32.140
MATT: "All right, it's about 130 gold for the
masts, getting the various bits of the sails

04:52:32.140 --> 04:52:33.844
"repaired and fixed and everything."

04:52:33.844 --> 04:52:35.663
TRAVIS: Yeah.

04:52:35.663 --> 04:52:38.592
MATT: "All right, I'll get them paid." Mark down
that amount.

04:52:38.592 --> 04:52:40.480
TRAVIS: 130 gone.

04:52:40.480 --> 04:52:44.228
LIAM: Twiggy, do you have that jar of beads?

04:52:44.228 --> 04:52:49.450
DEBORAH: I did take it. Right? I use my hand. I do
have that jar of beads.

04:52:49.450 --> 04:52:51.209
LIAM: Are you attached to it?

04:52:51.209 --> 04:52:52.530
DEBORAH: Oh, no, you can have it.

04:52:52.530 --> 04:52:53.917
LIAM: Thank you.

04:52:53.917 --> 04:52:55.971
DEBORAH: I pass the beads over to him.

04:52:55.971 --> 04:52:57.136
LIAM: I walk off.

04:52:57.136 --> 04:52:58.137
DEBORAH: How you feeling?

04:52:58.137 --> 04:52:59.928
LIAM: I walk off.

04:52:59.928 --> 04:53:06.158
TALIESIN: If you stick around, I'm going to be
helping every-- I'm doing a thing.

04:53:06.158 --> 04:53:07.903
LIAM: Already gone.

04:53:07.903 --> 04:53:12.410
TALIESIN: Okay. 23 points to everybody who's
hanging around for a few minutes.

04:53:12.410 --> 04:53:13.463
TRAVIS: How many?

04:53:13.463 --> 04:53:15.097
MATT and TALIESIN: 23 points.

04:53:15.097 --> 04:53:16.469
TALIESIN: It's been a long day.

04:53:16.469 --> 04:53:18.482
DEBORAH: Yes, it has.

04:53:18.482 --> 04:53:30.352
TRAVIS: Well, let's just call that lesson learned,
yeah? Maybe we should all reconnoiter in the morning.

04:53:30.352 --> 04:53:37.448
TALIESIN: Sometimes mysterious spheres just happen
to you, if I'm learning anything.

04:53:37.448 --> 04:53:41.847
TRAVIS: The good news is is that if Twiggy
actually killed the dragon-- which you obviously did--

04:53:41.847 --> 04:53:42.706
DEBORAH: Thanks.

04:53:42.706 --> 04:53:44.339
TRAVIS: We can go back.

04:53:44.339 --> 04:53:45.901
SAM: I don't want--

04:53:45.901 --> 04:53:47.400
TALIESIN: I mean, maybe, sure.

04:53:47.400 --> 04:53:49.946
LAURA: There were lots of jewels on the ground.

04:53:49.946 --> 04:53:51.745
TRAVIS: Yeah, it sounded bad when it came out.

04:53:51.745 --> 04:53:57.716
DEBORAH: Well, I just want to say that this was
the most fun adventure I've ever had in my lives

04:53:57.716 --> 04:54:04.288
and you guys are the bestest friends that I've
ever had, and I think you should keep the Ball of

04:54:04.288 --> 04:54:11.396
Fun, but I'd be very careful because Sir Cadigan's
after it. I better keep moving, so I might get off

04:54:11.396 --> 04:54:12.598
here, you guys.

04:54:12.598 --> 04:54:13.727
LAURA: You don't want to stay with us?

04:54:13.727 --> 04:54:18.599
DEBORAH: You guys have been the greatest friends
ever, but I've spent my whole life in a box. I'm

04:54:18.599 --> 04:54:20.665
going to go exploring.

04:54:20.665 --> 04:54:21.442
SAM: Oh.

04:54:21.442 --> 04:54:23.406
LAURA: I understand that.

04:54:23.406 --> 04:54:24.743
DEBORAH: Thanks.

04:54:24.743 --> 04:54:28.281
SAM: It was nice to meet you and nearly die next
to you.

04:54:28.281 --> 04:54:33.153
DEBORAH: Thanks for saving my life. (as Trixie)
Yeah, thanks for that!

04:54:33.153 --> 04:54:37.699
TRAVIS: As an honorary member of The Mighty Nein,
just do us a favor and make sure you tell your

04:54:37.699 --> 04:54:39.863
story far and wide, yeah?

04:54:39.863 --> 04:54:43.657
DEBORAH: I shall. I shall speak of your bravery to
all that I meet.

04:54:43.657 --> 04:54:47.140
TALIESIN: Lets pack some food and some tea and
stuff before you go, you're going to need some--

04:54:47.140 --> 04:54:48.644
DEBORAH: Oh, I've got chocolate!

04:54:48.644 --> 04:54:50.791
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to go get some food.

04:54:50.791 --> 04:54:55.442
MARISHA: Thanks, Twiggy. I'm sorry I found your
cuteness alarming.

04:54:55.442 --> 04:55:03.528
DEBORAH: I have that effect on people. I put my
hood up and two little Twiggys stand there and go

04:55:03.528 --> 04:55:05.478
Bye, bye!

04:55:05.478 --> 04:55:07.189
TALIESIN: Oh, that's weird.

04:55:07.189 --> 04:55:11.816
LAURA: I would do that too, but I think I'm out of
the ability.

04:55:11.816 --> 04:55:14.084
DEBORAH: I'm all out.

04:55:14.084 --> 04:55:15.909
LIAM: You stowing away, is that what's happening?

04:55:15.909 --> 04:55:20.787
DEBORAH: Yes, I go up to the gangplank, or
whatever's attached to the dock, and I wave and

04:55:20.787 --> 04:55:25.103
say: Be good, be brave! Thanks for the adventure!

04:55:25.103 --> 04:55:26.656
LIAM: Halas.

04:55:26.656 --> 04:55:28.692
SAM: Bye!

04:55:28.692 --> 04:55:30.993
TRAVIS: Make good life choices!

04:55:30.993 --> 04:55:33.560
DEBORAH: I'll back up down the plank.

04:55:33.560 --> 04:55:39.036
TRAVIS: She's leaving us, it's the best life
choice.

04:55:39.036 --> 04:55:43.607
MATT: You watch her gnomish form vanish off the
docks and mingle with the rest of the villagers of Bisaft.

04:55:43.607 --> 04:55:45.699
MARISHA: Well, that was the weirdest seven days I
didn't know I had.

04:55:45.699 --> 04:55:47.858
TALIESIN: Yeah.

04:55:47.858 --> 04:55:50.416
MARISHA: Jester, are you all right?

04:55:50.416 --> 04:55:52.518
LAURA: Oh, yeah, of course. I'm fine.

04:55:52.518 --> 04:55:55.347
MARISHA: You're a bad liar.

04:55:55.347 --> 04:55:59.020
LAURA: (laughter) I'm a really good liar, Beau.

04:55:59.020 --> 04:56:01.356
MARISHA: Sure.

04:56:01.356 --> 04:56:12.347
LAURA: I'm going to go to my room. (shuddering
sigh) And go to sleep.

04:56:12.347 --> 04:56:14.841
LIAM: Are you okay?

04:56:14.841 --> 04:56:18.163
SAM: Am I okay? Yes, I'm fine. Are you okay?

04:56:18.163 --> 04:56:20.730
LIAM: (quietly) Would you jump up here?

04:56:20.730 --> 04:56:22.106
SAM: Would I what?

04:56:22.106 --> 04:56:23.657
LIAM: Would you jump up?

04:56:23.657 --> 04:56:24.721
SAM: Onto you?

04:56:24.721 --> 04:56:25.769
LIAM: Yeah.

04:56:25.769 --> 04:56:33.185
SAM: I will jump up onto Caleb and I will give him
a big kiss on his nose, and I will whip out the

04:56:33.185 --> 04:56:39.601
last book I had. We still have books to go
through!

04:56:39.601 --> 04:56:50.829
LIAM: I'll look at those tomorrow. Let's go get
some sleep. I start walking off towards our quarters.

04:56:55.079 --> 04:56:56.304
MARISHA: Hey, Fjord?

04:56:56.749 --> 04:56:58.561
TRAVIS: Yep?

04:56:58.561 --> 04:57:04.994
MARISHA: I feel like there's this trend of us
feeling shitty after we come out of a fight.

04:57:04.994 --> 04:57:14.369
TRAVIS: Right. I'd say something about that that
doesn't kill you makes you stronger, but I feel

04:57:14.369 --> 04:57:17.406
pretty fucking weak right now.

04:57:17.406 --> 04:57:19.011
MARISHA: Hmm.

04:57:20.711 --> 04:57:22.655
TRAVIS: That was a dragon.

04:57:23.394 --> 04:57:32.098
MARISHA: That was a dragon. I don't even know what
any of it meant.

04:57:34.890 --> 04:57:43.013
TRAVIS: That little crazy Ball o' Fun is a
troublemaker. Just like Twiggy.

04:57:45.580 --> 04:57:50.570
MARISHA: Well, I guess there's still time to
figure it all out.

04:57:51.597 --> 04:57:55.466
TRAVIS: Maybe we just leave that particular
function alone for a while and collect some gold

04:57:55.466 --> 04:57:58.774
to recoup our repair costs.

04:57:59.574 --> 04:58:03.740
MARISHA: It feels like that gold was stealing from
the dragon, just slowly but surely.

04:58:03.740 --> 04:58:06.200
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

04:58:06.200 --> 04:58:13.588
MARISHA: Yeah. Anyway... But he's dead now, so
what does it matter? We could just slowly drain

04:58:13.588 --> 04:58:16.014
it. It's like a never-ending piggy bank.

04:58:16.014 --> 04:58:19.532
TRAVIS: Yeah, if a big, blue finger comes through
the hole, we'll know Twiggy lied.

04:58:19.532 --> 04:58:21.289
MARISHA: That's true.

04:58:21.289 --> 04:58:24.797
TRAVIS: I'm going to go get rid of this concussion
now.

04:58:26.528 --> 04:58:33.724
MARISHA: I guess I'm going to stay up. I don't
feel like sleeping just yet.

04:58:33.724 --> 04:58:38.782
TRAVIS: All right, first mate, you got the con.

04:58:38.782 --> 04:58:40.451
MARISHA: Copy that, captain.

04:58:40.451 --> 04:58:43.178
TRAVIS: (groans)

04:58:47.438 --> 04:58:52.861
TALIESIN: I'm probably going to come out about
halfway through your shift with a pot and two

04:58:52.861 --> 04:59:01.696
cups. Another day.

04:59:01.696 --> 04:59:05.591
MARISHA: How are you?

04:59:05.591 --> 04:59:09.721
TALIESIN: Weirdly, I think I'm great.

04:59:13.572 --> 04:59:15.604
MARISHA: Oddly, I feel okay too.

04:59:15.604 --> 04:59:17.380
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know.

04:59:17.730 --> 04:59:19.437
MARISHA: Is that wrong of me?

04:59:19.437 --> 04:59:20.291
TALIESIN: No.

04:59:20.291 --> 04:59:22.145
MARISHA: I feel like everyone else feels so
terribly.

04:59:22.792 --> 04:59:27.183
TALIESIN: Well, in the morning, we're going to
comfort everybody. We're going to take care of

04:59:27.183 --> 04:59:32.696
them, we're going to feed them. It's going to be
our job to feel good for them and bring them back

04:59:32.696 --> 04:59:35.794
around. They did good work, they just don't
believe it.

04:59:38.290 --> 04:59:45.545
MARISHA: I think I oddly feel the most comfortable
when things are a fraction away from going

04:59:45.545 --> 04:59:47.275
terribly wrong.

04:59:49.217 --> 04:59:56.514
TALIESIN: Something's happening. I don't know
what, but something's happening. And you did good.

04:59:56.514 --> 05:00:00.683
MARISHA: So did you.

05:00:00.683 --> 05:00:07.083
TALIESIN: Thank you. Do better next time to keep
everybody safe.

05:00:10.794 --> 05:00:15.070
MATT: You both quietly sit there, drinking your
tea, finishing off the watch while the rest of

05:00:15.070 --> 05:00:22.246
your group sleeps soundly in their midday bunks,
recovering from the strenuous activities of

05:00:22.246 --> 05:00:36.130
surviving three chambers of a hundred-chambered
mage vault extraplanar home. We'll end it there

05:00:36.130 --> 05:00:39.154
and pick up on that next week.

05:00:39.504 --> 05:00:40.834
SAM: Wow!

05:00:40.834 --> 05:00:48.042
MATT: Well done guys, holy shit! We have this
ridiculous trend of guests killing bosses from the

05:00:48.042 --> 05:00:49.459
last campaign.

05:00:49.459 --> 05:00:50.718
LAURA: It's the craziest thing!

05:00:50.718 --> 05:00:52.756
SAM: Killing a dragon with a natural 20!

05:00:52.756 --> 05:00:57.668
LIAM: What a fucking delight Twiggy was!

05:00:57.668 --> 05:01:01.001
LAURA: Twiggy forever!

05:01:01.001 --> 05:01:03.864
TALIESIN: You had some weird-ass spells up, right?
You had some weird-ass shit that I didn't know

05:01:03.864 --> 05:01:07.851
about. I saw them, but I never really poked. You
don't have to tell me what it was; did you have

05:01:07.851 --> 05:01:10.348
some weird shit that if I had prodded it would
have been a thing?

05:01:10.348 --> 05:01:10.994
DEBORAH: No.

05:01:10.994 --> 05:01:12.428
TALIESIN: All right, okay, let's just do that
then.

05:01:12.428 --> 05:01:17.467
DEBORAH: No, I'm very normal. I just do weird
stuff with my normal stuff.

05:01:17.467 --> 05:01:18.906
MATT: I like that.

05:01:18.906 --> 05:01:20.466
LIAM: Descriptive.

05:01:20.466 --> 05:01:24.143
MATT: Thank you guys so much for watching. Thank
you again, Deborah, for joining. You were such a

05:01:24.143 --> 05:01:28.093
joy. Was there anything you want to talk about or
plug before we leave?

05:01:28.093 --> 05:01:35.559
DEBORAH: Oh yeah! I have a game coming out. We're
doing a show with Geek &amp; Sundry called Relics and

05:01:35.559 --> 05:01:40.510
Rarities, and it's super silly and fun and great
and I hope that everyone will love it, and I just

05:01:40.510 --> 05:01:44.184
want to say a big thank you to you guys because I
don't think that would be possible either for me

05:01:44.184 --> 05:01:49.262
without all of you paving the way and being so
supportive and so incredible and so inspiring.

05:01:49.262 --> 05:01:50.997
Thank you so much!

05:01:50.997 --> 05:01:52.568
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's awesome.

05:01:52.568 --> 05:01:54.698
LAURA: That set looks killer!

05:01:54.698 --> 05:01:56.144
MATT: It looks so good.

05:01:56.144 --> 05:01:57.716
DEBORAH: It's so cool. Thank you guys.

05:01:57.716 --> 05:01:58.911
LIAM: Thanks for playing.

05:01:58.911 --> 05:02:03.343
MATT: Thank you guys. Have a wonderful night.
We'll see you next week. We love you, and is it

05:02:03.343 --> 05:02:06.202
Thursday yet? Good night.
