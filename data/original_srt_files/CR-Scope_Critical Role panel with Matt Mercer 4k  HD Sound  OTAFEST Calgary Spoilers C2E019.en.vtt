00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:25.919
[brassy big band music]

00:00:26.525 --> 00:00:30.407
ORGANIZER: Please welcome to the Otafest 20th
Anniversary Main Stage, Mr. Matt Mercer!

00:00:30.407 --> 00:00:56.247
(cheering)

00:00:56.247 --> 00:01:06.854
MATT: Hi. Wow, this is surreal. I also like the
very intimate, casual lounge space here we get to

00:01:06.854 --> 00:01:13.992
share. Just here in my den. Thanks for coming,
guys. I don't have my smoking jacket! I wasn't

00:01:13.992 --> 00:01:23.217
prepared, unfortunately. Next time. First off,
thank you all for coming to my panel. This is

00:01:23.217 --> 00:01:25.037
amazing! You guys all are amazing people.

00:01:25.037 --> 00:01:29.853
(cheering)

00:01:29.853 --> 00:01:33.761
MATT: And thank you for having me out here to
Calgary. I'm having a great time. You guys have

00:01:33.761 --> 00:01:39.714
been phenomenal, the weather's been incredible,
it's been great. I'm super happy to be here, and

00:01:39.714 --> 00:01:50.764
particularly for this panel! We get to discuss a
bunch of really nerdy things. As a quick heads-up,

00:01:50.764 --> 00:02:00.085
if you have any children in the audience, I
apologize if any phrases or terminology escape

00:02:00.085 --> 00:02:08.079
mine or the questioner's mouths that might be
sensitive to their ears. But we talk about a lot

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:09.400
of nerdy shit, so.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.392
AUDIENCE MEMBER: [inaudible]

00:02:13.392 --> 00:02:18.308
MATT: I like that. Anyway, my name is Matthew
Mercer. I am a voice actor from Los Angeles,

00:02:18.495 --> 00:02:27.191
California. I've been into D&amp;D, tabletop gaming,
and all sorts of crazy nerd things for the

00:02:27.191 --> 00:02:34.916
majority of my life. I owe most of my interest in
the performing arts from getting into role-playing

00:02:34.916 --> 00:02:42.512
games at a very young, first year in high school,
14-year old age, and I've been playing ever since.

00:02:42.512 --> 00:02:49.159
Thanks to tabletop games, I've found the majority
of my closest friends through the years, I've

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:57.219
discovered more confidence in myself, I've been
able to fine-tune critical thinking skills, I've

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:04.797
been able to emotionally empathize in ways that I
probably wouldn't have otherwise. I owe a lot to

00:03:04.797 --> 00:03:09.692
role-playing games, and I think a lot of people
here can probably say a similar thing, based on

00:03:09.692 --> 00:03:15.103
the conversations I've had with a lot of you
through this weekend, and other events as well. It

00:03:15.103 --> 00:03:21.317
means a lot to me, and the fact that we've been
able to begin doing our game on the internet in a

00:03:21.317 --> 00:03:26.810
very scary time when we were like, "No one's going
to watch this at all!" and have this incredible

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.302
community that sprung up around us and so many
other great live play casts, and the gaming

00:03:32.302 --> 00:03:40.783
community in general. It's been a huge inspiration
and honor, perpetually humbling, and occasionally

00:03:40.783 --> 00:03:49.483
stressful. I don't want to spend too much time
talking off the top of my head. I want to get

00:03:49.483 --> 00:03:54.776
questions from you guys, but first and foremost,
just a raise of hand here: who hasn't watched any

00:03:54.776 --> 00:04:03.384
of Critical Role before you came to this panel
today? Apologies for being very confused, as you

00:04:03.384 --> 00:04:08.761
may have been already, and will continue to be for
the rest of this panel. If you haven't picked up

00:04:08.761 --> 00:04:12.624
on what it is yet, it is a bunch of us nerdy-ass
voice actors sitting around and playing Dungeons &amp;

00:04:12.624 --> 00:04:13.209
Dragons.

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:19.062
(cheering)

00:04:19.062 --> 00:04:24.478
MATT: To get the question out there first, because
this comes up often, it began out of a home game

00:04:24.478 --> 00:04:27.664
that I ran for a bunch of these voice actor
friends of mine. I've been playing for a long

00:04:27.664 --> 00:04:31.983
time, and I've run many games and campaigns and
different systems and such, but years ago, my

00:04:31.983 --> 00:04:36.768
friend Liam O'Brien-- we were working on Resident
Evil 6 together. He was directing it. I mentioned

00:04:36.768 --> 00:04:39.548
my D&amp;D game that I was running for another group
of friends, and he's like, "Man, I've always

00:04:39.548 --> 00:04:42.776
wanted to play. I haven't played since I was a
kid!" and I was like, "I'll run you a one shot

00:04:42.776 --> 00:04:46.543
some time! Invite some people over!" and he was
like, "Okay," and I was like, "Seriously, your

00:04:46.543 --> 00:04:50.908
birthday's coming up. Let me do it for your
birthday." He lagged forever, but eventually got

00:04:50.908 --> 00:04:56.510
around to going, "Okay, fine. We'll do a make-up
birthday game." We invited a bunch of mutual

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.268
friends in the industry who had mostly never
played before. I threw Taliesin in there because

00:05:00.268 --> 00:05:06.411
he was the ringer who I'd been playing with for
years before that, and we ran a game. They were

00:05:06.411 --> 00:05:13.712
confused, and they were laughing, and by the end
of it, they had an incredible time. What was

00:05:13.712 --> 00:05:19.201
supposed to be a one shot turned into a continuous
campaign, and then two years later, word had

00:05:19.201 --> 00:05:24.788
gotten around about it through conversations in
the industry. Somehow, through a conversation with

00:05:24.788 --> 00:05:27.529
Ashley Johnson, who you saw on there playing Yasha
in the new campaign--

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:30.663
(cheering)

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:33.499
MATT: She and Felicia Day were having a
conversation about the campaign, and Felicia

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:39.092
basically said, "Why don't you bring this on our
channel, Geek &amp; Sundry?" We discussed that at

00:05:39.092 --> 00:05:45.264
length and thought that would be a terrible idea
because there was no format for it. Every time we

00:05:45.264 --> 00:05:48.668
went into a meeting with them, they'd be like,
"You know, well, what if--" and we'd be meeting

00:05:48.955 --> 00:05:52.218
with certain people on the production team that
didn't really understand tabletop games as much,

00:05:52.218 --> 00:05:55.588
and they'd be like, "Well, you play your game, and
you roleplay, and then when you go to the boss

00:05:55.588 --> 00:05:59.983
fight, you jump over to play the video game
version of D&amp;D and you fight it in the game," and

00:05:59.983 --> 00:06:07.419
I'm like, "No. That's not how this works." It
wasn't until Twitch began to emerge as a format

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:11.264
that we had a conversation. I was like, "Is there
a possibility that we can set up cameras in the

00:06:11.264 --> 00:06:16.529
room and not change anything? We just want to keep
playing our game. You can put cameras there, and

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:20.688
we'll get used to it, and we'll go as we have
been. Is that okay? Can you do that?" And they

00:06:20.688 --> 00:06:26.043
said, "We can probably do that." And that's how
the show started. We began streaming with their

00:06:26.043 --> 00:06:31.640
Twitch channel, and we had, still at the time, a
surprising number of people. We had a few hundred

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.509
people, I think, almost a thousand at one point,
watching the first episode. I'm like, "That's

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:38.258
crazy! We'll never hit that number again!"

00:06:38.258 --> 00:06:43.099
(laughter)

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:45.937
MATT: Three years later, we started the first
episode of the new campaign, which you just

00:06:45.937 --> 00:06:51.805
watched, which across all platforms, when they
finished counting, we had live concurrents, not

00:06:51.805 --> 00:06:58.484
total views, but the highest concurrent view count
of people watching at one time, was 125,000.

00:06:58.484 --> 00:07:03.964
(cheering)

00:07:03.964 --> 00:07:09.478
MATT: Live. As that number began to climb right
before we started the new season, we're all

00:07:09.478 --> 00:07:12.648
sitting there at the table as they're counting
down, "Five minutes to air!" and we're all going,

00:07:13.102 --> 00:07:25.288
"What's happening?!" It's been a very surreal
ride. It's been strange, and stressful, and

00:07:25.288 --> 00:07:31.191
incredible. It's changed my life in so many
wonderful ways, partially just for being able to

00:07:31.191 --> 00:07:37.204
express ourselves in a very honest light. In this
industry, in the entertainment industry, there's

00:07:37.204 --> 00:07:42.824
very much a drive for an expectation that as a
performer, as a face of the industry whether it be

00:07:42.824 --> 00:07:47.321
small or on a larger scale, to create a persona
for yourself, to present yourself in a

00:07:47.321 --> 00:07:53.396
professional way, and only act this certain way,
and it feels very sterile and removed and not

00:07:53.396 --> 00:08:01.923
true. This show, this campaign, has enabled us to
be ourselves and be friends. It's a very scary

00:08:01.923 --> 00:08:07.089
endeavor, and we were worried, and there are, of
course, people on the internet that still get

00:08:07.348 --> 00:08:12.997
angry. We get our fair share of hate mail, but
that comes with the territory, and that's fine.

00:08:12.997 --> 00:08:18.497
Ultimately, the majority of the feedback has been
so positive from you guys, and the community that

00:08:18.497 --> 00:08:24.928
sprung around this has far eclipsed what our
little show is now. We're happy to be this hub,

00:08:24.928 --> 00:08:30.907
but seeing all of you and all the people that have
come together across the world around our little

00:08:30.907 --> 00:08:35.232
silly, improvised narrative every week, and then
taking that inspiration and taking it to their

00:08:35.232 --> 00:08:41.304
art, to take it to their ideas, and to their
drives and goals, to get their friends or families

00:08:41.304 --> 00:08:46.330
together, or make new friends and create their own
stories, and then we get the chance to meet at a

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:54.956
convention like this, and tell each other that.
That is so powerful, and incredible, and I have no

00:08:54.956 --> 00:09:01.310
words to describe the positive impact it's had on
my life and the life of my players and my friends,

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:04.248
so thank you for that. Sincerely.

00:09:04.248 --> 00:09:12.997
(cheering)

00:09:13.535 --> 00:09:20.828
MATT: Not many people can say they've proudly
cried on the internet multiple times in front of a

00:09:20.828 --> 00:09:31.433
bunch of strangers, especially in a red jacket,
but that's where we're at now. We don't want to

00:09:31.433 --> 00:09:34.756
create personas, we don't want to hide behind
something. We just want to be ourselves and hope

00:09:34.756 --> 00:09:40.058
that that's enough. I hope at least we can promote
more of that in the world, out there. There's too

00:09:40.058 --> 00:09:46.659
much misinformation, and falsehood, and ideas that
who you are isn't enough. I think that's so untrue

00:09:46.659 --> 00:09:53.903
and unhealthy. It's been really scary, but very
cathartic for us to put ourselves on display in a

00:09:53.903 --> 00:10:00.508
very vulnerable place like this, and have it be
largely accepted. It's been very therapeutic for

00:10:00.508 --> 00:10:05.705
us, as I'm sure it's been for a lot of you. I've
met many people who in their own way, in very

00:10:05.705 --> 00:10:10.110
similar ways, this game and this community has
helped them through a lot of hard times, as it's

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:15.467
helped me and a lot of us through as well.
Whatever this positive feedback loop we've

00:10:15.467 --> 00:10:20.160
developed is can change the world in some small
way, I think we're doing it, and it's really

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.009
exciting to be doing it with you guys.

00:10:22.009 --> 00:10:29.322
(cheering)

00:10:29.322 --> 00:10:30.897
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I fucking love you, Matt!

00:10:30.897 --> 00:10:40.596
MATT: I fucking love you too, man! But enough of
the softie shit. We're going to talk about

00:10:40.596 --> 00:10:50.726
Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Because I pontificated and
splurged out onto the stage for you-- That was not

00:10:50.726 --> 00:11:03.354
the right term to use. Immediate regret. Pulled my
heart out, that's better. Let's go ahead and bring

00:11:03.354 --> 00:11:07.921
us to a Q&amp;A section of this panel, because I want
to hear what you guys are curious about, and I

00:11:08.259 --> 00:11:11.818
want to answer what questions I can, and then
laugh at the ones I can't answer, because it's a

00:11:11.818 --> 00:11:16.816
spoiler. Which, as a note, I do want to preface
this, please. If you have any questions about

00:11:16.816 --> 00:11:22.084
campaigns that may be spoilers to people who are
new to the series or aren't caught up, please be

00:11:22.084 --> 00:11:30.183
careful to be vague, and not spoil those elements.
If you do, we'll figure out some sort of horrible,

00:11:30.183 --> 00:11:39.438
painful, torturing vengeance on you. Please do
your best not to spoil that. We have a couple of

00:11:39.438 --> 00:11:44.123
fantastic mic runners in the audience, so I'm
going to try and-- there's a lot of hands. Oh,

00:11:44.123 --> 00:11:47.195
right over here, we have one on the side! Perfect.
Hello!

00:11:47.195 --> 00:11:57.801
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We see the players, between
campaign one and two, choose what kind of

00:11:57.801 --> 00:12:04.805
personalities they enjoy playing, but you play so
many different personalities. What are some of

00:12:04.805 --> 00:12:07.915
your favorite personalities and voices to play?

00:12:07.915 --> 00:12:10.774
MATT: You mean an archetype, like a general
archetype?

00:12:10.774 --> 00:12:11.431
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah.

00:12:11.431 --> 00:12:19.203
MATT: Oh man. I mean, Gilmore's a perfect
example.

00:12:19.203 --> 00:12:24.088
(cheering)

00:12:24.088 --> 00:12:30.902
MATT: I like the idea of representing somebody who
is not just confident in their personality, but

00:12:30.902 --> 00:12:38.616
confident in their sexuality, confident in who
they are unabashedly, and is eager to connect with

00:12:38.616 --> 00:12:43.190
those that are willing to take them for who they
are. Gilmore very much represents an element of

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:50.040
that, inspired by somebody I knew in high school.
He's become this character that I put love into at

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:54.707
the beginning, but didn't expect to become such a
central part of the campaign. Well, we know how

00:12:54.707 --> 00:13:02.937
that turned out. For me, that's definitely a
personality archetype I'd say I was drawn to

00:13:02.937 --> 00:13:14.757
representing in that game. I really enjoy
conniving villains. Brutes are fun, big beasts are

00:13:14.757 --> 00:13:21.172
great, terrible monstrous entities that are forces
of nature are good. I love villains that are

00:13:21.172 --> 00:13:30.834
plotting, and weaving a web of deceit. There's
been a few in the last campaign. We're still

00:13:30.834 --> 00:13:38.922
getting our footing on the new campaign, guys! For
those who are caught up on recent episodes, we're

00:13:38.922 --> 00:13:49.337
starting to get into the good stuff. The
introduction is over. For me, that's another

00:13:49.337 --> 00:13:54.275
archetype I really enjoy. It's hard to pick,
because part of the fun for me is the variety.

00:13:54.275 --> 00:13:57.895
Part of the fun of being Dungeon Master is that
for each archetype that I play, I get to go, "Ooh,

00:13:57.895 --> 00:14:02.030
"I haven't tried that yet! What else haven't I been
able to embody? What else have I been unable to

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:08.124
"represent in my world to show how diverse I want
it to be?" Those are the two that probably stand

00:14:08.124 --> 00:14:13.742
out at the top of my head, if I had to pick, but I
enjoy them all for their own unique, particular

00:14:13.742 --> 00:14:19.902
reasons. And weird characters with strange
affectations, (as Victor) you know the kind.

00:14:19.902 --> 00:14:23.701
(cheering)

00:14:24.119 --> 00:14:28.611
MATT: Thank you for the question! Where's the next
one? Oh! Hello!

00:14:28.611 --> 00:14:34.748
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi! What was your favorite scene
that you didn't have planned out in the first

00:14:34.748 --> 00:14:37.922
campaign, and the second campaign too, so far?

00:14:37.922 --> 00:14:41.266
MATT: My favorite-- sorry, I missed the question,
there.

00:14:41.266 --> 00:14:44.311
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Your favorite improvised scene.

00:14:44.311 --> 00:14:55.764
MATT: Improvised scene. Oh man. I would say in the
first campaign, Victor's a great sequence that was

00:14:55.764 --> 00:15:01.446
improvised. But for me, to really feel like I was
kicked off my chair and didn't know where we were

00:15:01.896 --> 00:15:06.332
going, when the party decided to go to the Fire
Elemental Plane to retrieve the Plate of the

00:15:06.332 --> 00:15:14.462
Dawnmartyr. I had assumed it was going to happen
much later and I had barely outlined the City of

00:15:14.462 --> 00:15:18.739
Brass at that point, and they're like, "Well,
let's just go there right now. All right, let's

00:15:18.739 --> 00:15:26.633
"go!" I'm like, "Okay! Uh, so--" notes, remembering
some of the things that I was toying around in my

00:15:26.633 --> 00:15:32.271
head to develop that I hadn't quite put down yet
and just ran with it. The whole arrival to the

00:15:32.271 --> 00:15:40.657
City of Brass, the encounter with the first two
guardians they came across, Senokir was a entirely

00:15:41.156 --> 00:15:46.134
improvised NPC that I hadn't prepared. That whole
sequence of that episode was me going like, "Okay,

00:15:46.134 --> 00:15:51.924
"let's see where this goes!" But that's also really
thrilling to me as a DM, I love those moments.

00:15:51.924 --> 00:15:55.384
They're scary, and a lot of DMs out there will
attest to this. It's a scary thing to be in that

00:15:55.384 --> 00:15:58.538
space, but it's thrilling. The adrenaline's
pumping, and when you're done with that session,

00:15:58.538 --> 00:16:04.234
you're like, "That was magic!" That's the real
magic of running a game, so that definitely stood

00:16:04.234 --> 00:16:11.519
out to me. In the newer campaign? Oh man, there's
been a few choice moments.

00:16:11.519 --> 00:16:15.275
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible shouting)

00:16:15.714 --> 00:16:26.041
MATT: People are shouting moments at me. The
question was for me! I answer! (laughing) Oh man.

00:16:26.041 --> 00:16:37.924
I think whenever Fjord goes into his various--
changing his illusory form and then messing with

00:16:37.924 --> 00:16:44.889
NPCs has been fun. For me, it's been really fun to
watch Travis go from a super dumb character to a

00:16:44.889 --> 00:16:50.819
really intelligent, charismatic one. For me, it's
been fun to improvise with him whenever he does

00:16:50.819 --> 00:16:57.382
things to manipulate and get information out of
NPCs, especially as a different persona. Those

00:16:57.382 --> 00:17:02.574
have been fun. Anyway, I spent a lot of time on
this question and I'll get to the next one. It's a

00:17:02.574 --> 00:17:03.091
good question.

00:17:03.091 --> 00:17:05.203
MIC RUNNER: All right. Just so you guys know, you
don't have to hold your hand up the whole time.

00:17:05.203 --> 00:17:10.470
You can put it down and put it back up again
because we're not counting who went up first. So

00:17:10.775 --> 00:17:13.108
don't worry, don't break your arms. We've got a
question here from Stockton.

00:17:13.108 --> 00:17:14.568
MATT: It's a good deltoid workout.

00:17:14.568 --> 00:17:21.207
STOCKTON: Hi Matt, love the hair. I was curious,
what is either the craziest or stupidest thing

00:17:21.207 --> 00:17:23.291
you've ever let a player get away with?

00:17:23.291 --> 00:17:40.194
MATT: (laughing) There's some crazy ones in this
campaign. For me? It was impactful because the

00:17:40.194 --> 00:17:47.372
moment was so intense. I ran an Expedition
Ravenloft 3.5 game years ago, and towards the end

00:17:47.372 --> 00:17:53.663
of the campaign, they all were brought to Barovia
and all were generally functional people when they

00:17:53.663 --> 00:17:59.454
first arrived, but as is the nature of Ravenloft,
that did not last long. One of the characters, who

00:17:59.454 --> 00:18:06.423
was the rogue of the group-- he was a professor,
an Indiana Jones-type-- used to be a tomb delver

00:18:06.423 --> 00:18:11.550
who gave it up as he acquired tomb rot that he's
been keeping at bay for years. The further they

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:16.262
went in, the more corrupt they grew, and in
Barovia, the tomb rot began to spread and he began

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:26.895
to become a darker entity. The bard, who my friend
Jack played, who is this pansexual Vistani, Skald,

00:18:26.895 --> 00:18:33.370
character that, eventually, his teeth began to
sharpen from his physical corruption. Everyone got

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:40.399
messed up in that game. But when they defeated--
before they got to Strahd, there was a huge feud

00:18:40.399 --> 00:18:48.492
going on between the professor rogue and the bard.
The bard was trying to tell him why his ideas were

00:18:48.492 --> 00:18:53.975
too violent and why he needed to calm down, and
then the professor character got fed up with it

00:18:53.975 --> 00:19:00.824
and cut out the bard's tongue. And my players were
there for it. They were like, "This is

00:19:00.824 --> 00:19:11.288
"incredible." Jack, who played the bard, was like,
"Seriously? Let's go." So it became this struggle

00:19:11.288 --> 00:19:15.824
back and forth, and he overpowered him onto the
ground and grabbed his tongue and cut it out and

00:19:16.077 --> 00:19:21.256
his character couldn't talk for the rest of the
campaign. It was all gestures. Then when they

00:19:21.256 --> 00:19:26.838
finally defeated Strahd at the end of the game,
"absolving Barovia" of the terrors of Strahd--

00:19:26.838 --> 00:19:31.986
Reinhardt was the name of the professor--
Professor Reinhardt took the throne for himself

00:19:31.986 --> 00:19:39.103
and became the new lord of Barovia with his
chained, silent, toady bard, Skald, sitting at the

00:19:39.103 --> 00:19:52.058
base of the throne. It was very Game of Thrones,
it was pretty messed up. Shout out to Sean Manzano

00:19:52.058 --> 00:19:59.191
who played that rogue, it was awesome. Good
question! All right, next one. Oh, ah!

00:19:59.191 --> 00:20:05.610
MIC RUNNER: This gentleman's name is Matthew, he'd
like me to ask his question for him. He's

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:10.796
wondering, in your opinion, what was the worst
part of Fifth Edition and how did it affect your DMing?

00:20:10.796 --> 00:20:18.403
MATT: What do I feel is the worst part about fifth
edition? Let me see. I really like Fifth Edition,

00:20:19.015 --> 00:20:22.207
I think of all the editions of D&amp;D that have come
before, to me, it's the most tailored to my game

00:20:22.207 --> 00:20:27.686
style. I think it's simplified in a lot of the
rules compared to previous editions where it

00:20:27.686 --> 00:20:37.174
allows the narrative to flow a little better. I
would say-- that's an interesting question. The

00:20:37.174 --> 00:20:41.988
worst part of Fifth Edition is still one of the
hard parts about D&amp;D is sometimes, the mechanical

00:20:41.988 --> 00:20:49.533
rules can get a little fidgety when you get to the
fine print, which I get reminded of weekly

00:20:49.533 --> 00:20:53.745
whenever any of us make a mistake on the stream
and Twitter, half an hour later's like, "You did

00:20:54.211 --> 00:21:04.948
"this wrong!" I look it up and I'm like, "You're
right! Good job!" But it does teach me and it does

00:21:04.948 --> 00:21:10.634
help. Sometimes I'll do research to make rule
calls and then there'd be places that confirm it

00:21:11.001 --> 00:21:14.412
one way and others that confirm it the other and
there's a little misinformation there. They're

00:21:14.412 --> 00:21:21.530
getting better at clarifying that as they go. I
would say that's my biggest complaint, there

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:26.701
aren't a whole lot. The stealth rules being a
little vague are a good and a bad thing. It's good

00:21:26.701 --> 00:21:30.003
because it's open to interpretation to how you
want to run it in your game, it's bad for the same

00:21:30.003 --> 00:21:33.460
reason because then you have players arguing about
what should and should not be done, and there's

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:38.610
countless forum threads of people arguing about
stealth. They even did a Dragon magazine post on

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:42.680
it with Jeremy Crawford discussing essentially
what the intended use was and even then,

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:49.646
everyone's like, "Peh!" The Internet's going to
Internet, I guess. But largely, I think it's a

00:21:49.646 --> 00:21:55.148
large improvement. I will say I miss that they
removed the skill challenge system from Fourth

00:21:55.148 --> 00:21:58.390
Edition, which is one of the good things that I
really like about Fourth Edition. I've brought

00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:04.535
elements of it in, homebrewing it a bit. But yeah.
Thank you.

00:22:04.535 --> 00:22:06.134
MIC RUNNER: We've got a question over here from
Milo.

00:22:06.634 --> 00:22:08.668
MILO: Hi, over here.

00:22:08.668 --> 00:22:12.006
MATT: There's a lot of-- Oh, there we go! Thank
you.

00:22:12.006 --> 00:22:15.458
MILO: How do you deal with player characters that
hate each other?

00:22:15.458 --> 00:22:24.459
MATT: (chuckling) This is a good question. Now,
the people hate each other, or the characters?

00:22:27.239 --> 00:22:33.057
Both? Okay. Well, if you have players at the table
that hate each other, that's not good for anybody.

00:22:33.057 --> 00:22:41.153
One of them will probably have to go, because
that's not good. They need to work out their shit!

00:22:41.549 --> 00:22:45.197
And then bring them back to the table, and if one
or the other can't leave, maybe they need to

00:22:45.197 --> 00:22:48.251
figure their stuff out and find some other
players, because otherwise, you're dragging

00:22:48.251 --> 00:22:52.310
everybody else at the table through their personal
muck. That's not healthy, and that's not conducive

00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:56.886
to a good gaming experience. That's nothing
against them individually, but if it's your table

00:22:56.886 --> 00:22:59.831
and you're the GM and you're putting in all of
this time and energy into it, they have to respect

00:22:59.831 --> 00:23:05.670
that to not let it affect the game. Player
characters that hate each other, you have to talk

00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:14.919
with the players a bit. One, I would hope that the
players would be aware enough to not ruin the

00:23:14.919 --> 00:23:18.567
narrative of the game and the fun of the players
just for the sake of what they feel is true to

00:23:18.567 --> 00:23:23.607
their characters' feelings. There is still a
collaborative element of storytelling here. If the

00:23:23.607 --> 00:23:26.938
player digs their feet in like, "This is what my
character would do, and I don't care how it

00:23:26.938 --> 00:23:35.368
"affects the rest of you!" That's not a really fun
player, in my opinion. You can have strong virtues

00:23:35.368 --> 00:23:41.924
and have conflict and have that temporary hatred
if you need it, but you still need to help add to

00:23:42.232 --> 00:23:46.749
the narrative and keep the story moving. So that
player, it's on their responsibility to leave some

00:23:46.749 --> 00:23:52.569
wiggle room to be open to still allowing the story
to go and maybe throttle back a bit on their

00:23:52.569 --> 00:23:57.418
hatred. As the GM, it helps for you to work with
that player to decide why they hate that other

00:23:57.418 --> 00:24:02.481
character, what the driving force is behind that,
and then build a story that might aid them to

00:24:02.481 --> 00:24:07.881
surmount and overcome that difference. Maybe part
of the story and narrative-- if it's a racial

00:24:07.881 --> 00:24:11.546
frustration between dwarves and elves, the
classic, maybe part of the story is them

00:24:11.546 --> 00:24:16.059
discovering this ancient ruin where dwarves and
elves actually live together peacefully. The more

00:24:16.059 --> 00:24:19.713
they uncover the information, the lore of it, they
realize that there was an older society where they

00:24:19.713 --> 00:24:25.782
worked together very well and actually was a very
fantastic society, and their bloodlines came from

00:24:25.782 --> 00:24:30.766
this and all of a sudden there was a history of
it. Or if one of them did something to betray the

00:24:30.766 --> 00:24:34.570
other person, maybe there's a way in the story
down the road that they can make up for that

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:40.333
betrayal or prove that it wasn't intentional and
that somebody else was framing them for it. It's a

00:24:40.333 --> 00:24:44.650
little bit of a back-and-forth responsibility if
the story calls for that. But, once again, the

00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:50.063
player has to be willing to help the narrative
move forward in spite of it. Otherwise, it's just

00:24:50.063 --> 00:24:56.926
not fun for anybody at the table. I hope that
helps. Next question. Ah!

00:24:56.926 --> 00:24:58.850
MIC RUNNER: All right, this is Hailey.

00:24:58.850 --> 00:24:59.915
MATT: Hi Hailey.

00:24:59.915 --> 00:25:09.049
HAILEY: Hey again! I'm a writer, and I thought
maybe trying to be a DM would be fun. Any tips for

00:25:09.049 --> 00:25:09.645
new DMs?

00:25:09.645 --> 00:25:18.606
MATT: Yes, it's scary-- at first. Then it gets a
little less scary over time. It never quite goes

00:25:18.606 --> 00:25:23.882
away. I'm still nervous every week before we go
up, but you learn to harness that nervous energy.

00:25:23.882 --> 00:25:30.244
Don't think that your nerves mean that you're not
ready. Use that to your advantage, and when I say

00:25:30.244 --> 00:25:38.186
that, meaning that natural place of anxious energy
comes with its own adrenaline in the moment. What

00:25:38.186 --> 00:25:43.090
you do is you prepare what you can in advance and
that energy will drive you to pull from your

00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:49.660
preparation. For me? Talk with the players
beforehand and make sure you're all on the same

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:54.245
page. If they're all close friends-- especially if
they're strangers, if they're people you haven't

00:25:54.245 --> 00:25:57.951
met before, be like, "Hey guys, we're building
this story together. This is my gift to you,

00:25:57.951 --> 00:26:03.558
"please work with me and the story, this is my
first time. Be patient and if there's any rules

00:26:03.558 --> 00:26:08.094
"that I get incorrect, feel free to remind me of
what's in there, but don't fight me on it

00:26:08.094 --> 00:26:12.445
"necessarily, we're all learning this together." A
little bit of prep and making sure that everyone's

00:26:12.445 --> 00:26:16.667
on the same page and understands where you're
coming from. As far as your preparation goes, most

00:26:16.667 --> 00:26:21.316
of it's going to go out the window anyway because
that's the nature of running a game. But beyond

00:26:21.771 --> 00:26:27.706
producing things for your story, I recommend
having some note cards or small side prep for

00:26:27.706 --> 00:26:32.397
random NPCs, things that aren't part of your main
narrative you're trying to build. Locations or

00:26:32.397 --> 00:26:37.145
objects or personalities that may pop up because
in that moment where the players, all of a sudden,

00:26:37.145 --> 00:26:41.638
veer to the right to where you have nothing
prepared, you can go, "Oh, well that's where you

00:26:41.638 --> 00:26:49.274
"run into-- Dave the blacksmith." That little bit
of extra prep saves you in those moments where

00:26:49.274 --> 00:26:53.577
they end up going off the intended rails. It's
okay to railroad a party when you're first

00:26:53.611 --> 00:26:57.961
beginning, too. Don't feel like you have to build
an open sandbox and go, "Explore everything for

00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:04.761
the first time, oh god!" As you get comfortable
with it, you'll get better at it, and the players

00:27:04.761 --> 00:27:07.793
will understand. As long as you're having a good
time and everyone's having a good time, you're

00:27:07.793 --> 00:27:11.725
doing it right. If you get the rules wrong,
doesn't matter. If everyone's having fun, you're

00:27:11.725 --> 00:27:13.845
doing it right. That's my recommendation.

00:27:13.845 --> 00:27:19.858
MIC RUNNER: All right, Matt. I'm far away from
you. Look, me!

00:27:19.858 --> 00:27:22.488
MATT: There! Lot of hands, I'm like, "Oh god,
where'd they go?"

00:27:22.488 --> 00:27:24.897
MIC RUNNER: We've got a question for you. If you
can stand up and introduce yourself.

00:27:24.897 --> 00:27:29.549
JASMINE: Hi Matt! We met last night, I'm Jasmine.
I'm wondering, for this campaign, who's managed to

00:27:29.549 --> 00:27:32.441
surprise you the most with their character and how
they act?

00:27:32.441 --> 00:27:44.889
MATT: (chuckling) Oh, man. Laura was definitely
the biggest shift for me to go from this sultry,

00:27:44.889 --> 00:27:54.095
strong badass of Vex into this boisterous, chaotic
entity that is Jester. That really surprised me. I

00:27:54.095 --> 00:27:57.390
didn't know what she was going to do until we did
our first session zero for the campaign and I was

00:27:57.390 --> 00:28:02.846
like, "What is this going to be?! Oh no! You're
the wild card, aren't you?" No, they're all wild

00:28:02.846 --> 00:28:14.797
cards, I discovered. That surprised me initially
with the character choices. As far as their story

00:28:14.797 --> 00:28:21.743
and things they've done, honestly, Nott's really
surprised me, Sam's Nott. Going from this what you

00:28:21.743 --> 00:28:28.523
think is a silly voice, little goblin girl, oh,
she's so crazy! Then it has severe emotional beats

00:28:28.523 --> 00:28:34.124
and all of this backstory that's slowly pouring
out. Nott's really surprised me, too, but all of

00:28:34.124 --> 00:28:38.381
them have had those moments so far! Once again,
it's like picking your children, in a weird way.

00:28:38.381 --> 00:28:42.898
Some of the characters are more of a slow burn,
and I really enjoy that, too, but as far as

00:28:42.898 --> 00:28:48.029
surprising, those are usually the bigger shifts,
so Jester and Nott to me are the more surprising

00:28:48.029 --> 00:28:52.683
ones definitely, but that doesn't mean I'm not
enjoying the other character narratives as much,

00:28:52.683 --> 00:28:55.647
but yeah, those two probably. Good question.

00:28:55.647 --> 00:28:57.974
MIC RUNNER: Way at the back. Right here.

00:28:57.974 --> 00:28:59.044
MATT: Oh, I see.

00:28:59.044 --> 00:29:06.676
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi. As a DM, I was wondering how
far ahead and how in-depth do you usually try to

00:29:06.676 --> 00:29:13.980
make this story and how much of the overall story
do you have before you sit down at the table?

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:21.716
MATT: I've been doing this for a long time. I try
to have general ideas of what the long-term story

00:29:21.716 --> 00:29:27.184
might be. Very simple, I'll have a page in my
notes that just says, "Future story stuff," and

00:29:27.184 --> 00:29:32.097
it's just bullet points of, "Bullet point: maybe
one day they'll fight this. Maybe one day they'll

00:29:32.454 --> 00:29:36.566
"go here. Maybe one day they'll discover a thing."
They're super vague and open, and I can always go

00:29:36.566 --> 00:29:40.734
back to that later when I'm fine-tuning my story
and their narrative and what I want to pull in and

00:29:40.734 --> 00:29:49.445
flesh out. When I'm developing for an immediate
session, I consider what the main goal is that's

00:29:49.445 --> 00:29:53.941
unifying the party, and that's the thing too, you
have to come up with a narrative that's going to

00:29:54.313 --> 00:29:57.278
unify the party. You can do it the easy way and
say that they're already conscripted mercenaries

00:29:57.278 --> 00:30:01.727
and they've already been working together. Or you
can be an idiot like me and have them all show up

00:30:01.727 --> 00:30:06.640
for the first time in a tavern and find a reason
for them to come together again. Little harder,

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:14.493
but it can be done. But as far as prep goes, don't
get caught up in all the details of the macro

00:30:14.493 --> 00:30:21.804
world. You can come up with vague-- we're in a
kingdom and it's either malevolent or benevolent,

00:30:21.804 --> 00:30:26.963
and then you think of the city or the location
where the first story is happening. Then you flesh

00:30:26.963 --> 00:30:32.942
out some of the important people in your story.
You flesh out what their goal is and who they're

00:30:32.942 --> 00:30:37.742
going to meet along the way to that goal. What
challenges they'll uncover, and that involves not

00:30:37.742 --> 00:30:43.960
just creatures and battles they may have, but also
what sort of physical or mental challenges they'll

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:49.907
come across that can give each player a chance to
shine. That's a big thing about the game is you

00:30:49.907 --> 00:30:53.357
have a group of players and they all want to have
a moment in the spotlight, to feel like they're

00:30:53.357 --> 00:30:57.125
useful, that they have something to give to the
party, which also makes all the other players

00:30:57.125 --> 00:31:01.783
appreciate that person's character. "Thank God you
were here or we'd be in bad spot," that kind of

00:31:01.783 --> 00:31:06.890
thing. So if you have a rogue in the party, think
of some way that their skill set that they chose

00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:10.840
can be useful that nobody else in the party can
really tackle. Or if you have someone who's really

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:15.443
charismatic and talky, have a social encounter
where they have to extract information in a subtle

00:31:15.443 --> 00:31:19.429
way, that nobody else in the party can do. So
consider what they players' strengths are. Give

00:31:19.429 --> 00:31:24.952
them each a moment in the spotlight, some simple
NPCs that might be part of the story, the

00:31:24.952 --> 00:31:29.870
encounters they might come across, and that's all
you need for your first game. That's really all

00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:33.847
you need. The rest of it you can improvise on the
spot. Keep it simple. As long as those players

00:31:33.847 --> 00:31:38.974
have that clear goal in mind, they'll guide the
story. Once you have that established, it will be

00:31:38.974 --> 00:31:42.779
much easier for you to flesh out the gaps in
between. Once you get to the part where that

00:31:42.779 --> 00:31:46.745
little town or that little section of the world
where they've been playing in for a game of two

00:31:46.745 --> 00:31:51.716
has been set, you can begin to expand to where the
roads might go from there. Is there another town

00:31:51.716 --> 00:31:59.093
20 miles north? Is there a passage of mountains
that leads to a dwarven citadel that's gone dark

00:31:59.093 --> 00:32:05.516
for a year or so? Does it lead to a shoreline
where there are mermaids? Those are things you get

00:32:05.516 --> 00:32:09.326
to think of as you expand. Don't feel like you
have to flesh it all out at once, in my opinion.

00:32:09.326 --> 00:32:10.856
Good question.

00:32:10.856 --> 00:32:14.712
MIC RUNNER: Okay, we've got another standing-room
question here at the back. We've got M.

00:32:15.117 --> 00:32:15.695
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi.

00:32:15.695 --> 00:32:20.539
MATT: Somewhere back there, hi. Oh I see! Making
you work for it, sorry.

00:32:20.539 --> 00:32:27.615
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi. My question was, If you
yourself were to be in a Dungeons &amp; Dragons world,

00:32:27.615 --> 00:32:30.337
what race and class do you think you'd be?

00:32:30.337 --> 00:32:34.306
MATT: What would I be, or what would I want to be?
Or both?

00:32:34.306 --> 00:32:35.799
AUDIENCE MEMBER: What you would be.

00:32:35.799 --> 00:32:43.610
MATT: What I would be? Probably like a human or
half-elf bard. I mean, that's...

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:49.520
(cheering)

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:53.584
MATT: My whole existence in tabletop gaming has
been trying to fight the age-old trope that

00:32:53.584 --> 00:32:54.722
charisma is a dump stat.

00:32:54.722 --> 00:32:56.673
(laughter)

00:32:56.673 --> 00:33:00.488
MATT: That used to be a real thing in Second Ed.
Everyone's like, "You put points in charisma?

00:33:00.488 --> 00:33:07.433
"You're so dumb." I'm like, with this DM, yes, but
in the future! (laughs) In the future it will come

00:33:07.433 --> 00:33:14.222
in handy. We'll actually talk to people in other
campaigns. So yeah. Probably bard, because I'm not

00:33:14.222 --> 00:33:17.539
good at fighting. I trip trying to get my teeth
brushed.

00:33:17.539 --> 00:33:20.114
(laughter)

00:33:20.423 --> 00:33:24.088
MATT: But I can talk okay. So I'll tell stories
and I'll be fine in a D&amp;D world, until I piss off

00:33:24.088 --> 00:33:29.490
some noble and they execute me in the middle of
the street. (laughs) Interesting question.

00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:31.148
MIC RUNNER: Right from the aisle here.

00:33:31.148 --> 00:33:33.010
MATT: All right. There we are.

00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:33.857
BRIAN: Hi, Matt.

00:33:33.857 --> 00:33:34.411
MATT: Hello!

00:33:34.411 --> 00:33:40.587
BRIAN: My name is Brian. You will know me as
brianspinkicker, the Critical Role giveaway winner

00:33:40.587 --> 00:33:41.586
for this week.

00:33:41.586 --> 00:33:42.924
MATT: Yeah, you won! Congratulations, man!

00:33:42.924 --> 00:33:46.541
(cheering)

00:33:46.541 --> 00:33:50.357
MATT: I have not met an actual giveaway winner in
person, so that's awesome!

00:33:50.357 --> 00:33:55.704
BRIAN: That's what I thought. That's what I
thought. Very much enjoying reading the Tal'Dorei

00:33:55.704 --> 00:33:56.748
campaign book.

00:33:56.748 --> 00:33:57.405
MATT: Thank you.

00:33:57.405 --> 00:34:03.555
BRIAN: And DM to DM, what was your inspiration for
writing the book?

00:34:03.555 --> 00:34:10.374
MATT: The inspiration for writing the book was
people asking me to write the book.

00:34:10.374 --> 00:34:11.972
(laughter)

00:34:11.972 --> 00:34:17.995
MATT: I never intended it to be something I put
out in the world. When I ran the first few games

00:34:17.995 --> 00:34:22.087
of the session, all I built was Stilben, the
little swamp town where it first started. And even

00:34:22.087 --> 00:34:25.771
then, I only built a couple of small sections of
it and some NPCs, basically the outline I told

00:34:25.771 --> 00:34:35.761
you, was what I did for the first few games we
ran. Then I made Westruun. So I made a second

00:34:35.761 --> 00:34:41.416
town. Then I expanded on Westruun. Then I made
Emon, and other things as it went out. But this

00:34:41.416 --> 00:34:45.705
was all stuff that I was just making up on the
fly. My notes were just madmen scrawlings on my

00:34:45.705 --> 00:34:49.652
computer that nobody else was supposed to read.
But as the show began to get a following, people

00:34:49.652 --> 00:34:52.929
were like, I want to play in this world. Do you
have anything, can you put out something? And I

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:55.807
was like, I don't-- no one can read this.

00:34:55.807 --> 00:34:57.897
(laughter)

00:34:57.897 --> 00:35:02.728
MATT: Really? And so when we began talking with
Green Ronin about publishing it, I was like, okay.

00:35:02.728 --> 00:35:07.936
All right. I'll put out a layout and oh, I have to
make all of this legible now, don't I?

00:35:07.936 --> 00:35:09.223
(laughter)

00:35:09.223 --> 00:35:12.421
MATT: So I had to go through all my old notes, and
rewrite everything to where another person could

00:35:12.421 --> 00:35:19.402
hopefully read it and understand it. Like most of
the things we put out for the show, it's all

00:35:19.402 --> 00:35:23.789
reactionary. We're all just having people yell at
us, "Make this thing," and we're like, "Okay!"

00:35:23.789 --> 00:35:25.617
(laughter)

00:35:25.617 --> 00:35:29.256
MATT: And the book was one of them. And it was the
scariest thing, because one, I've never made a

00:35:29.262 --> 00:35:33.596
book before. That was new. And now I have!

00:35:33.596 --> 00:35:34.890
(cheering)

00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:38.240
MATT: And it's crazy! And when it was coming out,
I was like, what if they hate it?

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:39.501
(laughter)

00:35:39.501 --> 00:35:42.413
MATT: What if I'm like, "I made a book," and
they're like, "Burn it!" I'm like (scared noise).

00:35:42.413 --> 00:35:46.615
So I was genuinely very scared. I was very nervous
about it going out there, because it was my first

00:35:46.615 --> 00:35:49.587
time and because I didn't know if it was going to
be any good, so I was very happy that people seem

00:35:49.587 --> 00:35:50.165
to like it.

00:35:50.165 --> 00:35:56.887
(cheering)

00:35:56.887 --> 00:36:01.169
MATT: But yeah, I mean honestly, like a lot of
things, the inspiration was you guys. It was you

00:36:01.169 --> 00:36:06.136
guys asking, and me going, maybe I can do this,
and I did, so thank you.

00:36:06.136 --> 00:36:07.778
(cheering)

00:36:07.778 --> 00:36:09.237
MATT: You push me to be better.

00:36:09.237 --> 00:36:11.284
MIC RUNNER: We're in your sightline, I think.

00:36:11.284 --> 00:36:12.152
MATT: Oh, haha.

00:36:12.152 --> 00:36:13.812
MIC RUNNER: All right, we've got Michaela here.

00:36:13.812 --> 00:36:14.476
MATT: Hello.

00:36:14.476 --> 00:36:19.899
MICHAELA: Hi. Related to your last topic, do you
have any tips on how to get your own material

00:36:19.899 --> 00:36:22.933
published if you're creating your own worlds and
everything?

00:36:22.933 --> 00:36:27.069
MATT: Oh. I made a book.

00:36:27.069 --> 00:36:30.215
(laughter)

00:36:30.215 --> 00:36:36.530
MATT: To get your stuff published, a lot of these
people I know and who I've talked to have been

00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:43.621
doing this for a while, is to first maybe start
small scale publishing, which things like the DMs

00:36:43.621 --> 00:36:48.536
Guild are really good places to start making a
name for yourself, where you can just self-publish

00:36:48.536 --> 00:36:55.628
work, for Fifth Edition D&amp;D, put it out there, and
people can try it, give their feedback, make a

00:36:55.628 --> 00:37:01.921
little money off of it. And through that, you can
use those tools to begin applying to publishers,

00:37:01.921 --> 00:37:08.060
like Cobalt Press, Green Ronin. These are the
companies that do third-party stuff and

00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:11.969
eventually, the main publishers of these RPGs out
there. You can maybe do stuff for World of

00:37:11.969 --> 00:37:18.215
Darkness or do things for Savage Worlds or D&amp;D.
But it's hard to publish if you don't have

00:37:18.215 --> 00:37:24.212
anything to show that you've put up yourself in
this day and age. It's the classic, in order to

00:37:24.212 --> 00:37:30.805
get a deal, you had to have had a deal. Well, that
doesn't work, but that's how it is. It's kind of

00:37:30.805 --> 00:37:35.990
how getting into the acting union was. You can
only get into an acting union by doing a union

00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:38.332
job, and you can't do a union job unless you're in
the union. Like, what?!

00:37:38.332 --> 00:37:39.830
(laughter)

00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:43.164
MATT: So you have to find those back roads by
meeting people, putting your work out there, and

00:37:43.164 --> 00:37:49.783
showing what you can do, and prove and show to
somebody that you actually have what it takes. You

00:37:49.783 --> 00:37:54.122
have the moxie, kid, that kind of a thing. But now
we have so many more resources online for

00:37:54.122 --> 00:37:58.633
self-publishing then there ever was. It's a great
time to start putting your stuff out there. The

00:37:58.633 --> 00:38:04.763
key is to make sure that you can get it to the
community, because it can also get lost in the sea

00:38:04.763 --> 00:38:09.860
of self-published stuff. So, honestly, reaching
out to a lot of those publishers, showing them

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:13.706
what you've done, and then once you have a
rapport, it will be much easier for you to get it

00:38:13.706 --> 00:38:17.471
to one of these publishers anything you want to
do. It's going to be hard to publish your own

00:38:17.471 --> 00:38:21.602
original setting as an initial thing, unless
you're Kickstarting it, and you have a lot of

00:38:21.602 --> 00:38:26.102
followers ready to go ahead and get behind that.
So you want to kind of build up that rapport with

00:38:26.102 --> 00:38:32.423
a publisher, doing stuff for them, and then you
can kind of delve into your own, whole projects.

00:38:32.423 --> 00:38:34.958
That's my suggestion. No worries.

00:38:34.958 --> 00:38:39.051
MIC RUNNER: To your right, close to the back. Over
here.

00:38:39.051 --> 00:38:43.486
MATT: Haha. Hi. I get excited whenever I find you
guys. It's like my own little Where's Waldo game.

00:38:44.016 --> 00:38:45.927
(laughter)

00:38:45.927 --> 00:38:48.898
AUDIENCE MEMBER: My girlfriend and I are actually
trying to start our first Dungeons & Dragons

00:38:48.898 --> 00:38:53.389
campaign. I was wondering if you could suggest any
pre-built campaigns we could start with.

00:38:53.389 --> 00:38:58.356
MATT: What kind of style of game do you like? Do
like super high fantasy? Do you like

00:38:58.356 --> 00:39:03.820
gothic horror? Do you like more intrigue and
mystique? What kind of story do you want to tell?

00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:05.747
AUDIENCE: [inaudible]

00:39:06.073 --> 00:39:07.561
(laughter)

00:39:07.561 --> 00:39:09.631
MATT: That is a-- although, any of them can be
that genre.

00:39:09.631 --> 00:39:11.770
(laughter)

00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:13.291
MATT: That's not a genre.

00:39:13.291 --> 00:39:16.683
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Her and I are actually more into
the gothic horror fantasy--

00:39:16.683 --> 00:39:17.425
MATT: Curse of Strahd.

00:39:17.425 --> 00:39:21.587
(laughter and cheering)

00:39:21.587 --> 00:39:26.441
MATT: That game I was talking about earlier where
the guy cut the other guy's tongue out? The Curse

00:39:26.441 --> 00:39:30.906
of Strahd is the newer version of that whole
storyline. It's completely renovated. It's very

00:39:30.906 --> 00:39:39.622
dark fantasy, mist-filled forests and vampires
and werewolves and undead and it's great.

00:39:40.137 --> 00:39:45.805
Basically Dracula. It's (mwah). Curse of Strahd
would be a great place to start looking for

00:39:45.805 --> 00:39:49.700
inspiration, and if not inspiration, to actually
run the module. So highly recommended.

00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:55.970
MIC RUNNER: Okay, I'm just here sort of
kitty-corner to where Alfred just was.

00:39:55.970 --> 00:39:57.203
MATT: Ahaha. There we go.

00:39:57.203 --> 00:39:58.931
MIC RUNNER: With the mask, this is Alexis.

00:39:58.931 --> 00:39:59.648
MATT: Hi, Alexis.

00:39:59.648 --> 00:40:09.130
ALEXIS: Hi, so a little detour. With Pillars of
Eternity II out, what's your favorite character

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:11.109
line from the original?

00:40:11.109 --> 00:40:17.077
MATT: Favorite character line from Pillars of
Eternity? Oh man. There's a conversation between

00:40:17.077 --> 00:40:21.352
Sagani and Eder that's amazing. For those who
haven't played Pillars of Eternity or Pillars of

00:40:21.352 --> 00:40:25.106
Eternity II, first off, great game series. I
backed the original on Kickstarter before I was

00:40:25.106 --> 00:40:30.907
even cast in it, which was very surreal. I grew up
playing Baldur's Gate, Planescape Torment, the

00:40:30.907 --> 00:40:36.457
classic isometric RPGs of the PC realm of the
2000's, so as soon as they began doing Pillars of

00:40:36.457 --> 00:40:39.481
Eternity, I was like, take my money, (nyuh).

00:40:39.481 --> 00:40:40.589
(laughter)

00:40:40.589 --> 00:40:43.840
MATT: And they put it back in, by hiring me as
voice actor. That was kind of cool how it worked

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:45.436
out. (laughs)

00:40:45.436 --> 00:40:48.135
(cheering)

00:40:48.135 --> 00:40:52.724
MATT: But it's a great story, and I play two
characters in there. I play Eder and Aloth. Aloth

00:40:52.724 --> 00:41:01.114
is this "Elven mage persona who's a bit nervous
and just wants to cast his spells, who has another

00:41:01.114 --> 00:41:08.094
"soul within his body, who is named Iselmyr, who's
this 'Old sort of Scottish angry lass, who beats face.'"

00:41:08.094 --> 00:41:10.243
(laughter)

00:41:10.243 --> 00:41:14.150
MATT: "I'm sorry. That was Iselmyr. That wasn't
me. I can't really control it." And the other's

00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:20.261
Eder, who's this kind of like "This good old boy. He's a
farmer in the Dyrwood who became a soldier for a

00:41:20.632 --> 00:41:24.354
"war and his god was killed in the war, and so he's
just kind of trying to find what his next path in

00:41:24.354 --> 00:41:26.571
"life is. And he loves to pet animals."

00:41:26.571 --> 00:41:28.635
(laughter and cheering)

00:41:28.635 --> 00:41:32.314
MATT: He loves animals. And there's this
conversation with Sagani, who's this dwarf ranger,

00:41:32.314 --> 00:41:41.137
who has this awesome fox companion, where he's
walking and says, "Hey, Sagani, can I pet your fox?"

00:41:41.138 --> 00:41:42.819
(laughter)

00:41:42.819 --> 00:41:46.452
MATT: And she goes, "Well it's your hand." And he
goes, "I'm going to pet him."

00:41:46.452 --> 00:41:48.503
(laughter)

00:41:48.503 --> 00:41:53.768
MATT: And then later on, as you're playing
through, another conversation happens comes up and

00:41:53.768 --> 00:41:57.575
she goes, "Eder, how's the hand?" He goes,
"Turning purple."

00:41:57.575 --> 00:41:59.926
(laughter)

00:41:59.926 --> 00:42:05.876
MATT: "Might have to cut it off." And she goes,
"You shouldn't have pet him." He's like, "If I

00:42:05.876 --> 00:42:07.986
"wasn't supposed to pet him, why did they make him
so soft?"

00:42:07.986 --> 00:42:10.067
(laughter)

00:42:10.067 --> 00:42:11.449
MATT: That's my favorite Eder line.

00:42:11.449 --> 00:42:12.447
MIC RUNNER: That's awesome.

00:42:12.447 --> 00:42:15.563
(cheering)

00:42:15.563 --> 00:42:20.316
MATT: Which, if you don't know, Pillars of
Eternity II. Not only are the whole cast of

00:42:20.673 --> 00:42:24.187
Critical Role voicing a lot of the companions and
main characters in the story, but there's a free

00:42:24.187 --> 00:42:28.207
DLC for the game where you get to download voice
sets and portraits of Vox Machina from our first

00:42:28.207 --> 00:42:30.177
campaign, and make them in the game--

00:42:30.177 --> 00:42:31.966
(cheering)

00:42:31.966 --> 00:42:38.628
MATT: --which is <i>so</i> surreal! Including Shaun
Gilmore. That's one of the most surreal moments of

00:42:38.628 --> 00:42:46.767
my life, was playing a video game, where our D&amp;D
characters were technically in it. I might have

00:42:46.767 --> 00:42:49.765
gotten a little emotional. (laughs)

00:42:49.765 --> 00:42:52.392
MIC RUNNER: Right at the front.

00:42:52.392 --> 00:42:54.242
MATT: Oh, look at that. Convenient. Hi.

00:42:54.242 --> 00:43:00.915
ALANA: Hi, my name is Alana and I was wondering if
you've ever brought a character from other roles

00:43:00.915 --> 00:43:05.321
you've done, like through your games and voice
acting, into Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:43:07.911 --> 00:43:10.205
MATT: It's kind of the other way around (chuckle).

00:43:10.592 --> 00:43:11.808
(laughter)

00:43:11.808 --> 00:43:16.159
MATT: A lot of voices that I've learned and
acquired for my work as a voice actor, started as

00:43:16.159 --> 00:43:23.351
NPCs. You know, being a dungeon master, for me,
was a great playground to build my toolbox of

00:43:23.587 --> 00:43:31.194
dialects and character voices and ranges. But for
instance, in the new campaign, Pumat Sol--

00:43:31.194 --> 00:43:35.563
(cheering)

00:43:35.563 --> 00:43:40.008
MATT: That voice stemmed from a cartoon that I
worked on, where they wanted a character voice

00:43:40.008 --> 00:43:49.005
that sounded kind of like a very happy,
lackadaisical kind of good old Minnesota type boy.

00:43:49.005 --> 00:43:53.123
And I kind of, (Pumat voice) "Kind of sort of just
came up with this guy."

00:43:53.123 --> 00:43:56.368
(cheering)

00:43:56.368 --> 00:44:03.832
MATT: "And so when I was designing this NPC for
The Invulnerable Vagrant, and I wanted to bring a

00:44:03.832 --> 00:44:10.179
"firbolg into the campaign, I was like, what would
a nice firbolg enchanter sound like? That's what

00:44:10.179 --> 00:44:11.172
"he'd sound like."

00:44:11.172 --> 00:44:12.506
(laughter)

00:44:12.506 --> 00:44:14.123
MATT: "Respectfully."

00:44:14.123 --> 00:44:16.300
(laughter and cheering)

00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:25.226
MATT: So that's an example. I'm trying to think.
It goes back and forth, it's hard for me to

00:44:25.703 --> 00:44:33.547
really point it out. I know Gilmore's slipped into
a few things, because it's hard not to. I lived

00:44:33.547 --> 00:44:39.138
these characters so much for a while, I'm pretty
sure I'm this close to clinical multiple

00:44:39.454 --> 00:44:44.832
personality disorder and proud of it. (laughs).
Good question.

00:44:49.212 --> 00:44:50.310
MIC RUNNER: Right here.

00:44:50.310 --> 00:44:52.375
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi Matt!

00:44:53.011 --> 00:44:54.523
MATT: Oh, here we go! Thank you.

00:44:54.523 --> 00:44:58.509
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi. We actually met last night. I
was the asshole that didn't know the rule, that

00:44:58.509 --> 00:45:06.621
you shouldn't ask the voice actor to do a voice.
My bad. I wanted to know: Obviously, you're

00:45:06.621 --> 00:45:11.268
writing a lot of your own stuff. What kind of
authors or media you take most inspiration from?

00:45:11.268 --> 00:45:18.613
MATT: I mean it's hard not to draw from Tolkien
because I grew up loving the Lord of the Rings

00:45:18.613 --> 00:45:26.626
books so much. They influence so much to what the
genre of fantasy is and I grew up as a fantasy

00:45:26.626 --> 00:45:33.607
kid. I like Star Wars, but while all my friends
were Star Wars kids, I was a Tolkien kid. They

00:45:33.607 --> 00:45:37.783
were like, "Let's watch Star Wars for the seventh
time," and I'm like, "That's cool. I'm going to

00:45:37.783 --> 00:45:45.359
read Two Towers for the seventh time." I'm going
to play my MUD for an entire summer. If anyone

00:45:45.359 --> 00:45:46.546
here who knows what a MUD is?

00:45:46.546 --> 00:45:48.011
(cheering)

00:45:48.011 --> 00:45:56.235
MATT: We're old! He's been a huge influence as
well, I have a biography on him in high school and

00:45:56.235 --> 00:46:00.377
everything for my English class. Really
interesting history, Tolkien. You don't realize

00:46:00.863 --> 00:46:05.849
how much The Silmarillion and the world of Middle
Earth, the genesis of it was during World War I

00:46:05.849 --> 00:46:10.391
when he was in the trenches. He was creating his
own Anglo-Saxon mythology that he didn't think

00:46:10.391 --> 00:46:15.293
existed and outside of King Arthur, it was the
closest thing England had to a mythology was as

00:46:15.293 --> 00:46:20.648
opposed to Grecian, Roman, and all these Norse
pantheons that were so great. That was an early

00:46:20.648 --> 00:46:24.109
genesis for The Lord of the Rings books. Sorry,
I'm going to a whole different panel there, whoa.

00:46:24.109 --> 00:46:29.795
Anyway, fascinating backstory to Tolkien if you
have the opportunity. Other authors that have

00:46:29.795 --> 00:46:39.234
really inspired me. Neil Gaiman, he's
incredible and sent me and Marisha a wedding gift.

00:46:39.488 --> 00:46:42.276
(laughter and cheering)

00:46:42.276 --> 00:46:48.353
MATT: That was surreal. I got in a Twitter
conversation with Amanda Palmer, his wife, because

00:46:48.353 --> 00:46:52.988
I've been a fan of hers since Dresden Dolls in the
mid-2000s and after a brief conversation she's

00:46:52.988 --> 00:46:58.047
like, "What's your address?" and she found out we
were getting married and mailed us a leather bound

00:46:58.047 --> 00:47:08.616
special edition of Stardust signed by both of them
and that will be in my family forever. He's great.

00:47:08.616 --> 00:47:19.258
In the comics realm, Brian Michael Bendis is great
writing. He left Marvel (fake crying). I get it. I

00:47:19.258 --> 00:47:24.294
read a lot of Piers Anthony growing up. I really
loved Piers Anthony when I was a kid and as I got

00:47:24.294 --> 00:47:31.160
older, looking back on it: it doesn't hold up.
There's a lot of sexist things in there I didn't

00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:37.253
understand as a kid, that I'm like, "Aw, buddy."
This didn't age well, but that happens, I guess.

00:47:37.253 --> 00:47:44.153
Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, some great sci-fi
authors of the 60s and 70s. I actually really

00:47:44.153 --> 00:47:48.195
enjoyed the Myst books that came out based on the
Myst game.

00:47:48.195 --> 00:47:50.488
(cheering)

00:47:50.488 --> 00:47:55.756
MATT: Yeah, we're old too! That should be plenty.

00:47:55.979 --> 00:47:56.762
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.

00:47:57.002 --> 00:47:57.660
MATT: Thank you.

00:47:57.660 --> 00:48:02.505
MIC RUNNER: All right, so just me here, I've got
two more questions, so all of you who have your

00:48:02.505 --> 00:48:07.272
hands up you can put them down. We've got them
selected, thank you. Also just to note, I'm going

00:48:07.272 --> 00:48:12.450
to get a wave from Matt's team here. If you guys
do have gifts and stuff, they are up in the front.

00:48:12.450 --> 00:48:18.192
You can come up and give them to these gals now if
you have something, otherwise we're going to move

00:48:18.192 --> 00:48:22.346
on to our last two questions for you, Matt. So
first one is with Scott. If you would stand up and

00:48:22.346 --> 00:48:23.610
ask your quick question.

00:48:23.610 --> 00:48:30.715
SCOTT: I was just wondering out of you as a player
if you've ever played D&amp;D and a dungeon master,

00:48:31.151 --> 00:48:34.356
which is a favorite character you've played and
why?

00:48:34.356 --> 00:48:46.114
MATT: Good question. I tend to be drawn towards
spell casters because I like the utility of

00:48:46.479 --> 00:48:54.917
options. I don't go for the high damage, the max
DPS. I want to be useful for the party and so I

00:48:54.917 --> 00:49:02.152
often fall into clerics or wizard roles and pick
spells that are more utility. In fact, Caleb in

00:49:02.152 --> 00:49:10.174
our later campaign is starting to go in a similar
utility route and I'm like, "Yeah, buddy, yeah!" I

00:49:10.176 --> 00:49:14.693
think, in spite of that, one of the characters I
had the most fun playing because I played spell

00:49:14.693 --> 00:49:22.799
casters my whole D&amp;D life, which I DMed for the
most of it, so players have a druid, a cleric, and

00:49:22.799 --> 00:49:27.867
a few wizards. For my friend Sean, who played that
rogue who cut out the tongue earlier, he was DMing

00:49:27.867 --> 00:49:31.740
a Fourth Edition campaign when it came out and I
was like, Fine, you know what? I'm going to try a

00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:39.077
martial class, I'm going to make a fighter, a
dwarf fighter. Just to give it a shot. God, he was

00:49:39.077 --> 00:49:43.758
so much fun. I used to make fun of fighters, I was
like, "Fighters aren't fun; all they do is

00:49:43.758 --> 00:49:53.351
attack." But oh man, so much freedom in how you
get to describe those attacks. It was so much fun

00:49:53.351 --> 00:49:58.275
to be ridiculous. Your turn comes around. "All
right, as I sit there heaving angrily, staring

00:49:58.275 --> 00:50:04.425
"with my one good eye into the face of the orc I
say (spitting), 'Come on, sir, let's see who

00:50:04.778 --> 00:50:09.510
'topples first! Hehehe!' As I run up the front of
his body and cleave my axe into his shoulder. As I

00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:13.205
"flip over the back I try and wrestle it from the
side of his arm, kick him behind and as he falls

00:50:13.205 --> 00:50:20.011
"to the ground I turn back and go, 'Ha ha, got
you.'" All it was was two attacks, but it was so

00:50:20.011 --> 00:50:24.422
much fun to get into it. As a person who grew up
watching martial arts movies and mixed martial

00:50:24.422 --> 00:50:30.402
arts and a lot of old school kung fu films, it's
really fun to be able to, in your mind,

00:50:30.402 --> 00:50:34.617
choreograph these fight scenes and martial classes
allow that flexibility that I really love. So I've

00:50:34.617 --> 00:50:39.720
probably had the most fun with my fighter than I
thought I would and he became an NPC in Tal'Dorei,

00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:46.873
he's actually a member of the Brawler's Guild who
was first the manager of Vox Machina pre-stream.

00:50:46.873 --> 00:50:50.979
He's in the campaign guide. Kradin Grimthorne, that
was my dwarf fighter.

00:50:50.979 --> 00:50:59.958
MIC RUNNER: All right, we're still at the front.
We've got our final question and it's Jordan.

00:51:00.493 --> 00:51:01.367
MATT: Hi Jordan.

00:51:01.367 --> 00:51:08.073
JORDAN: Hi Matt. DM to DM, how much input do you
have on your characters' backstories or your

00:51:08.073 --> 00:51:10.232
players' characters' backstories?

00:51:10.232 --> 00:51:18.294
MATT: That's a good question. What I usually do is
give them a primer for the world they are going to

00:51:18.294 --> 00:51:26.963
be playing in. It can be detailed, it can be
vague. Now I do, at least. With a one-shot

00:51:26.963 --> 00:51:30.878
campaign, I'm like, Make whatever and I'll
incorporate into the story; it wasn't meant to be

00:51:30.878 --> 00:51:36.594
a campaign. But for this campaign I sent them an
email that had some primers on the Dwendalian

00:51:36.594 --> 00:51:43.189
Empire, the tension at the Xhorhas border, some
information about the general infrastructure of

00:51:43.189 --> 00:51:48.735
the Menagerie Coast, and that was all. I said,
TThis is some information of the world your characters

00:51:48.735 --> 00:51:52.116
would have known no matter where they came from.
Which gave them some guidance to where they wanted

00:51:52.116 --> 00:51:55.824
to come from, that way it allowed for Jester and
Fjord to say they came from the Menagerie Coast.

00:51:55.984 --> 00:52:01.085
It allowed the other characters to decide if they
were from the Empire and what cities they may have

00:52:01.085 --> 00:52:06.316
been near. They made up cities in their background
that I incorporated into the map, because beyond

00:52:06.316 --> 00:52:10.219
that, I didn't have any input. I let them create
their backstory and when they sent their backstory

00:52:10.219 --> 00:52:15.416
to me, if there's any part of their backstory that
didn't quite fit with the way I was building the

00:52:15.416 --> 00:52:21.435
world, I would find a way to tie it in. For
instance, this is a complete example, if their

00:52:21.435 --> 00:52:26.957
backstory was "I was born from a noble that lived
in a golden tower and summoned dragons." I'd be

00:52:26.957 --> 00:52:37.206
like, "What if that was what the noble wanted to
do, but couldn't do yet?" We would scale anything

00:52:37.206 --> 00:52:42.303
that went too far, but didn't really need to do a
lot. It was more of just me offering the backdrop,

00:52:42.303 --> 00:52:46.831
they give me the backstory, and I take that
backstory and tie it in to some of my more

00:52:46.831 --> 00:52:51.978
detailed world buildings so they felt like what
they created locked in and became part of the

00:52:51.978 --> 00:52:58.409
breathing world and then we took it from there. I
want it to be a collaborative thing, I want it to

00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:03.204
feel like the players have had input on the world
we're creating. It helps them feel more invested,

00:53:03.204 --> 00:53:08.441
if ever they get the opportunity to tie into parts
of their backstory, or when elements of their back

00:53:08.441 --> 00:53:13.403
history come into play or are threatened, they
have a personal stake in it. Nothing gets a player

00:53:13.403 --> 00:53:18.384
more motivated than finding out their hometown is
suddenly under threat. That's a great gift for a

00:53:18.384 --> 00:53:24.822
DM to eventually drive the story forward and get
the players invested. That's my suggestion. Thank you.

00:53:24.822 --> 00:53:31.699

has been a lot of fun.

AUDIENCE MEMBERS: [inaudible shouting]

00:53:37.605 --> 00:53:49.190
MATT: (laughing) Hmm. Aww. You guys are so sweet.
But no, thank you guys for sitting here staring at

00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:53.856
me while we talked Dungeons &amp; Dragons into your
face. In fact, that's a thing that could happen,

00:53:53.856 --> 00:53:59.267
that exists and you guys are cool with it and you
didn't leave <i>en masse</i> at the beginning of this

00:53:59.267 --> 00:54:01.647

MATT: Unfortunately, this panel comes to a close.
It's been an absolute pleasure. Thank you so much

00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:22.840
for bringing me here, letting me be apart of this
wonderful Otafest 2018. You've been wonderful.

(cheering)

00:54:30.263 --> 00:54:34.648
MATT: I'll leave you with a thank you, a humble
appreciation for what you bring to this community

00:54:34.648 --> 00:54:39.235
and continue to prop each other up, because at the
end of the day all we really have is each other.

00:54:39.235 --> 00:54:40.634
Thank you, guys.
