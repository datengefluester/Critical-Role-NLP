NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.579
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:03.579 --> 00:00:08.377
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons & Dragons. Before we get into it, first

00:00:08.377 --> 00:00:11.417
off I wanted to welcome back our fantastic Ashly
Burch.

00:00:11.417 --> 00:00:14.130
SAM: Ashly Burch, everybody!

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.408
ASHLY: Oh, hello. Thank you.

00:00:17.408 --> 00:00:20.052
MATT: It's good to have you back. For those who
missed the announcement on Talks Machina, she'll

00:00:20.052 --> 00:00:25.992
be joining us for the next episode as well, and
for our GenCon live show.

00:00:25.992 --> 00:00:27.074
SAM: And maybe more?

00:00:27.074 --> 00:00:31.212
MATT: We'll see where it goes. I don't want to
take up too much of her time, but we'll see where

00:00:31.212 --> 00:00:37.973
it goes. We will at some point this evening have
another guest joining us, which we'll introduce as

00:00:37.973 --> 00:00:42.424
she comes in. We have already announced her, so it
doesn't matter, why am I holding it back? Sumalee

00:00:42.424 --> 00:00:50.097
Montano will be joining us, but she'll be coming
in as the narrative requires. In the meantime,

00:00:50.097 --> 00:00:54.041
let's get through some announcements. First and
foremost, we have our fantastic sponsor for the

00:00:54.041 --> 00:00:55.962
campaign, our friends at D&D Beyond.

00:00:55.962 --> 00:01:00.917
SAM: D&D Beyond, everybody! As mentioned last
week, the newly revamped digital character sheet

00:01:00.917 --> 00:01:07.309
for D&D Beyond has released. With improved desktop
and tablet views, better at-a-glance information,

00:01:07.309 --> 00:01:11.133
all kinds of customization, and an updated PDF
export.

00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:14.335
MATT: I'm really excited about that.

00:01:14.335 --> 00:01:20.790
SAM: As you guys all remember--not you; a couple
months back, I asked you Critters out there who

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:28.707
use D&D Beyond to write in and tell me about their
D&D Beyond experiences. With the studio move and

00:01:28.707 --> 00:01:35.156
stuff, things got lost. Some of the letters got
lost a little bit, or misplaced, but we found

00:01:35.156 --> 00:01:40.662
them. I'm going to read you some of the letters
from the fans. They're from a couple weeks ago.

00:01:40.662 --> 00:01:46.578
"Dear Sam, loving D&D Beyond. Just used their easy
character creator to roll a brand-new character

00:01:46.578 --> 00:01:51.815
"after my favorite PC was tragically killed last
week. I'm still really sad about it, but watching

00:01:51.815 --> 00:01:56.185
"your show is taking my mind off the loss. I love
how Critical Role doesn't remind me about that

00:01:56.185 --> 00:02:01.381
"death all the time." Again, these are from a few
weeks ago, so I haven't--

00:02:01.381 --> 00:02:02.982
MATT: You're such an asshole.

00:02:02.982 --> 00:02:09.879
SAM: "Dear Sam, my whole campaign uses D&D Beyond,
and their new shareable links really help us play

00:02:10.184 --> 00:02:15.527
"faster. Side note: I love your interactions with
Taliesin in this campaign! Don't change that

00:02:15.527 --> 00:02:19.632
"dynamic, it's perfect and I can't get enough of
it. Thank you."

00:02:19.632 --> 00:02:22.621
MATT: Goddamn it, Sam. You're the worst.

00:02:23.741 --> 00:02:29.480
SAM: "Dear Sam--" These are from a couple weeks
ago, that is the premise.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.053
MATT: These are the truth!

00:02:32.053 --> 00:02:37.025
SAM: "Dear Sam, just signed up for a Master-level
subscription at D&D Beyond, and all their content

00:02:37.303 --> 00:02:42.445
"is so cool! I'm enclosing a photo of a tattoo I
just got; it's my first and I'm very proud, as you

00:02:42.445 --> 00:02:47.889
"can see. That's Nott and Mollymauk dancing
together. I know it's in cursive, so you might not

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:54.875
"be able to read that they're both saying, 'We're
going to live forever!' What do you think?" There

00:02:54.875 --> 00:02:56.308
was a picture included in that one.

00:02:56.308 --> 00:02:58.417
ASHLY: For my first action I kill Sam.

00:02:58.417 --> 00:03:05.818
SAM: Last but not least, we got an actual letter
from the D&D Beyond corporation, which also got

00:03:05.818 --> 00:03:13.361
lost and found. It says, "Dear Sam: Hey, let's
refrain from anything sad or emotional in your ads

00:03:13.361 --> 00:03:18.100
"this week. We want players to associate our app
with fun, not intense loss that might trigger

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.892
"feelings of pain or misery. Keep it light! Do one
of those dumb songs you write. Oh, and give our

00:03:22.892 --> 00:03:33.846
"love to Taliesin! He's our favorite, and he's the
only reason we advertise on your show." I could

00:03:33.846 --> 00:03:37.597
not have planned it because those are from weeks
ago, Matt.

00:03:37.597 --> 00:03:38.153
MATT: Yes.

00:03:38.153 --> 00:03:43.619
MARISHA: I love that you "lost" the printed-out,
e-mail letters in our move.

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:47.602
SAM: Everyone used the same paper, stock, and
font.

00:03:47.602 --> 00:03:49.203
ASHLY: They look really pristine.

00:03:49.203 --> 00:03:52.543
SAM: All right. One of them was fake.

00:03:52.543 --> 00:03:58.708
MATT: Thank you, Sam. And thank you, our friends
at D&D Beyond, and I'm sorry.

00:03:59.628 --> 00:04:01.622
LIAM: You've got to laugh.

00:04:01.622 --> 00:04:11.612
MATT: Moving on from that, as a reminder we are
heading to San Diego Comic Con, like, in a day. As

00:04:11.612 --> 00:04:12.957
well as Ashly.

00:04:12.957 --> 00:04:13.553
ASHLY: I am.

00:04:13.553 --> 00:04:17.444
MATT: We're going to be also at New York Comic Con
in October, which we're excited about. Our Comic

00:04:17.444 --> 00:04:25.210
Con panel is this Saturday, July 21st at 6:30pm in
room 6BCF. We'll air the panel next Tuesday in

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.471
place of Talks Machina, so if you aren't there at
the event, you'll still have a chance to see the

00:04:28.471 --> 00:04:34.195
panel next week, so look for that. The details are
at CritRole.com. I will also be doing a cartoon

00:04:34.195 --> 00:04:40.455
voices panel that same day on Saturday at 1:00pm
in the same room, 6BCF. Ashly, I believe you have

00:04:40.455 --> 00:04:42.162
something going on at Comic Con as well.

00:04:42.162 --> 00:04:48.556
ASHLY: I'm going to be moderating the final San
Diego Comic Con Adventure Time panel, because the

00:04:48.653 --> 00:04:55.149
series is ending. It will be fun, but probably
sad, but fun! It'll be fun. I was told to keep it

00:04:55.149 --> 00:05:01.419
light. So I'm keeping it light. Then in the
evening, I'm going to be joining the good, good

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:06.809
boys of The Adventure Zone at their live show. So
I'm getting my D&D fill.

00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:07.863
SAM: A lot of adventure.

00:05:07.863 --> 00:05:10.862
ASHLY: A lot of adventure, a lot of D&D. It's
great.

00:05:10.862 --> 00:05:12.176
MATT: Give the boys our love.

00:05:12.176 --> 00:05:12.584
ASHLY: I will.

00:05:12.584 --> 00:05:18.258
MATT: Awesome. Moving on from that. We have Talks
Machina every Tuesday. Next week, you'll be able

00:05:18.258 --> 00:05:22.978
to see the panel. The week after that, you'll be
able to talk about whatever next week's episode is

00:05:22.978 --> 00:05:29.620
and this week's episode together! Every Tuesday at
7:00pm Pacific, here on Geek & Sundry's Twitch or

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:35.801
Alpha, where our fantastic host, Brian W. Foster,
destroys our sense of well-being and worth of

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:43.796
living. If you want to submit or email your GIFs
and fanart, give them to submit@talksmachina.com.

00:05:43.796 --> 00:05:49.631
Currently only the US and Canada, excluding
Quebec, are available for those giveaways because

00:05:49.631 --> 00:05:56.121
of weird laws. Check it out. A reminder that we
have our Wyrmwood giveaways during the break of

00:05:56.121 --> 00:06:00.625
Critical Role, but they are back under the
Critical Role Twitch stream. When we come to the

00:06:00.625 --> 00:06:05.458
break towards the middle of the evening, we'll
announce it, you move over to the Critical Role

00:06:05.458 --> 00:06:12.225
Twitch, twitch.tv/criticalrole, to be able to
enter it then. Keep your eyes posted, and I will

00:06:12.225 --> 00:06:18.601
notify you as that comes about. That is all I've
got as far as announcements, anyone have anything

00:06:18.601 --> 00:06:19.712
else they want to talk about?

00:06:19.712 --> 00:06:21.257
LIAM: I just want to procrastinate and prolong
the--

00:06:21.257 --> 00:06:22.157
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

00:06:22.157 --> 00:06:26.595
ASHLY: What'd you do today? What'd you eat for
breakfast?

00:06:26.595 --> 00:06:27.934
LIAM: Busy day? Was it a busy day?

00:06:27.934 --> 00:06:31.491
MATT: You assume I ate breakfast. You assume I've
eaten at all this week.

00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:32.165
ASHLY: Oh no!

00:06:32.165 --> 00:06:37.687
SAM: I'm sure if Laura were here, she would say
there are still many Nott the Best Detective

00:06:37.687 --> 00:06:40.498
Agency T-shirts in the store. Are there? I don't
know.

00:06:40.498 --> 00:06:41.765
MATT: I don't know, I should probably--

00:06:41.765 --> 00:06:43.209
SAM and ASHLY: Laura?

00:06:43.209 --> 00:06:44.102
SAM: Okay, she's not here.

00:06:46.022 --> 00:06:48.209
LIAM: Travis, bring me pickles!

00:06:48.209 --> 00:06:51.459
MATT: That's exactly what she'd be saying right
now.

00:06:51.871 --> 00:06:54.744
ASHLY: Oh my god, that was a perfect Laura. I
thought she was here!

00:06:54.744 --> 00:06:56.762
LIAM: Pretty spot on. I've known her a long time.

00:06:56.762 --> 00:07:04.029
MATT: All right then. That brings us into
tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:07:04.029 --> 00:07:06.539
LIAM and SAM: (scatting)

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:10.616
[click, TV static]

00:07:10.616 --> 00:08:27.789
[groovy Critical Role theme]

00:08:28.203 --> 00:08:29.376
MARISHA: --you!

00:08:29.376 --> 00:08:30.674
MATT: Welcome back.

00:08:30.674 --> 00:08:37.155
(laughter)

00:08:37.155 --> 00:08:41.465
MATT: (frustrated sigh) So?

00:08:41.465 --> 00:08:51.306
ASHLY: This is too much emotional emotional
whiplash. Can you stand for the full four hours?

00:08:51.306 --> 00:08:52.288
SAM: I want to.

00:08:52.288 --> 00:08:54.819
MATT: No! Oh god!

00:08:54.819 --> 00:08:56.266
LIAM: Metal.

00:08:56.266 --> 00:09:00.225
MARISHA: I can see the wrinkles from where it was
packaged.

00:09:00.225 --> 00:09:10.550
MATT: Okay then. Last we left off, The Mighty Nein
were making their way northward across the

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:16.248
northern side of the Marrow Valley, toward the
city of Shadycreek Run, to fulfill the second of

00:09:16.248 --> 00:09:21.298
two jobs they had accepted from The Gentleman
while they were in Zadash. Along the journey,

00:09:21.298 --> 00:09:24.314
while they were leaving Hupperdook in the middle
of the night, three of their members had been

00:09:24.314 --> 00:09:28.804
taken. It was discovered in the morning when they
were nowhere to be found, that they had been

00:09:28.804 --> 00:09:34.453
captured by a group of slavers traveling north
back to the city of Shadycreek Run itself. Upon

00:09:34.453 --> 00:09:42.245
investigating the details of this capture, you
encountered an individual coming up the road with

00:09:42.245 --> 00:09:49.976
a similar aligning interest, Keg. In discussing
the means of traveling to find these individuals

00:09:49.976 --> 00:09:55.512
responsible, and discovering that Keg had
information on them, you decided to travel

00:09:55.512 --> 00:10:03.661
together making your way around the Crispvale
Thicket. Encountering a number of indigenous,

00:10:03.661 --> 00:10:10.267
insect-like creatures known as ankhegs near the
long-abandoned farmlands that were once built in

00:10:10.267 --> 00:10:18.436
the outskirts of the forest. Camping inside, you
encountered a few members of a firbolg village

00:10:18.436 --> 00:10:24.216
that had long existed, hidden from the world
within this thicket that had been assaulted by

00:10:24.216 --> 00:10:34.108
these same slavers, known as the Iron Shepherds.
You encountered an elder protector of this tribe,

00:10:34.108 --> 00:10:40.143
along with a boy who had survived this encounter,
and were sent off on your way. Traveling northward

00:10:40.143 --> 00:10:49.011
on horseback, you managed to catch up and actually
make ground on the Iron Shepherds. Comparing your

00:10:49.011 --> 00:10:55.425
intel, and through a few surprises as to what they
were carrying, a plan was hatched to set an

00:10:55.425 --> 00:11:03.495
ambush, to halt them in their tracks, and assault
them. Upon the plan taking off, things were going

00:11:03.495 --> 00:11:09.538
in your favor, but through a series of bad lucks--
A bad lucks, the plural, it's an actual English phrase.

00:11:09.538 --> 00:11:10.518
ASHLY: That's how bad they were.

00:11:10.518 --> 00:11:16.016
MATT: They were bad. A series of moments of bad
luck, and a too-late realization of the

00:11:16.231 --> 00:11:24.575
overwhelming power of the foe you faced, one of
you fell. Mollymauk lies slain in the middle of

00:11:24.575 --> 00:11:33.433
the road at the hands of Lorenzo, the leader of
the Iron Shepherds. Making an example, pushing Keg

00:11:33.433 --> 00:11:40.121
onto the ground, leaving her with the knowledge of
what he perceives as her fault, to live with it;

00:11:40.121 --> 00:11:44.142
and to spread their name and the terror of what
they do, and not to let anybody else get in their

00:11:44.142 --> 00:11:50.541
way. You all watched quietly, unable to really
have a moment yet, to digest what has happened, as

00:11:50.541 --> 00:11:57.753
you see the carts slowly, quietly, make their way
northward: out of sight beyond the hills, towards

00:11:57.753 --> 00:12:08.008
your eventual destination. And that's where we
begin. There's a faint bit of snowfall that's

00:12:08.008 --> 00:12:16.766
still coming down from the clouds above you there
in the valley. The flurry, the storm that has been

00:12:16.766 --> 00:12:25.476
encroaching is not that far off. You look down
past the somewhat-muddy tracks of the wheels of

00:12:25.476 --> 00:12:32.370
the carts that had headed away from you, your
horses still stashed alongside the outer hills in

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:38.490
which you had set this ambush. You look down to
the bloodied, still body of Mollymauk, as the snow

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:42.322
slowly begins to fall and rest upon his form.

00:12:50.832 --> 00:13:02.021
LIAM: Okay. I'm going to give us about ten minutes
to figure out what we want to do here, and then I

00:13:02.021 --> 00:13:10.721
am sending Frumpkin out after them. We need to
decide something now, because I am going to be out

00:13:10.721 --> 00:13:11.655
of it for a bit.

00:13:13.075 --> 00:13:28.779
MARISHA: Yeah. We do need to decide something.
Beau walks over to Keg, and grabs Keg by the coif,

00:13:28.779 --> 00:13:34.508
and tries to slam Keg into the ground.

00:13:36.168 --> 00:13:36.940
MATT: Do you resist?

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:47.133
MARISHA: Did you think that maybe telling us that
Lorenzo was a high fucking magic user would have

00:13:47.133 --> 00:13:49.965
been-- Or are you still fucking working with
them?

00:13:49.965 --> 00:13:58.591
ASHLY: I didn't know! I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I
didn't know.

00:14:00.461 --> 00:14:08.046
LIAM: Beauregard, she would have told us. She
wouldn't have been able to hide it.

00:14:11.196 --> 00:14:17.398
MARISHA: Where is his fucking stupid tapestry?
Where is it?

00:14:17.398 --> 00:14:22.230
ASHLY: They are going to Shadycreek. They are
probably going to take them to The Sour Nest,

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:23.165
that's where they--

00:14:24.635 --> 00:14:30.480
MARISHA: I go, and I look. Is his tapestry still
on her horse?

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:36.225
MATT: Yeah, the tapestry of Bahamut is still
rolled up and strapped over the back of one of the horses.

00:14:36.225 --> 00:14:44.166
MARISHA: I storm over to it and I rip it off the
horse and I say: This is ours now. He was our

00:14:44.166 --> 00:14:48.471
fucking friend, he wasn't your fucking friend.
We're taking this back.

00:14:48.471 --> 00:14:59.062
LIAM: I pull Keg up. This place they are going, is
it permanent? Or a temporary camp, or it's been

00:14:59.062 --> 00:15:01.284
there for years and this where they always are?

00:15:01.284 --> 00:15:02.670
ASHLY: It's where they always are.

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:05.227
LIAM: Do you know how far off we are from it now?

00:15:05.227 --> 00:15:06.885
ASHLY: How far is Shadycreek?

00:15:06.885 --> 00:15:15.293
MATT: About two days' travel and it's maybe a two
hour journey into the forest north of Shadycreek.

00:15:17.803 --> 00:15:21.859
MARISHA: I go over to Molly's body.

00:15:26.519 --> 00:15:27.987
ASHLY: This is pointless.

00:15:30.067 --> 00:15:32.799
SAM: What? What is pointless?

00:15:32.799 --> 00:15:38.575
ASHLY: They're even more powerful than I remember.
I didn't even fucking know that Lorenzo could do

00:15:38.843 --> 00:15:44.900
that. You saw what he did, there's no way. It's
fucked.

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:55.837
MARISHA: I think she's fucking right. How long
have you been separated from these fucking assholes?

00:15:59.597 --> 00:16:02.321
ASHLY: (long sigh) Maybe a month, I don't know.

00:16:03.331 --> 00:16:06.252
SAM: They learned to do that in a month?

00:16:06.252 --> 00:16:06.979
ASHLY: Yeah.

00:16:06.979 --> 00:16:10.065
MARISHA: It's not a lot of time to--

00:16:12.085 --> 00:16:18.447
ASHLY: They didn't show me much. I'm clearly not
very fucking bright, so there's a lot I probably

00:16:18.447 --> 00:16:26.208
didn't pick up on, but-- I don't know. I'm
realizing I don't fucking know anything about them.

00:16:26.208 --> 00:16:30.842
LIAM: How many people are in their camp, what did
you call it?

00:16:30.842 --> 00:16:35.546
ASHLY: The Sour Nest is where the Iron Shepherds
have camp.

00:16:35.546 --> 00:16:36.044
LIAM: Yeah.

00:16:36.044 --> 00:16:41.191
ASHLY: But I mean, Shadycreek Run is-- It's a full
city.

00:16:41.191 --> 00:16:43.745
LIAM: Sure. What about The Sour Nest?

00:16:43.745 --> 00:16:49.949
ASHLY: I thought there were just five. I don't
know who those other two were. I don't fucking

00:16:49.949 --> 00:16:55.271
know! Everything that I thought I knew about
them-- I don't know.

00:16:56.821 --> 00:17:02.593
MARISHA: I search Molly's body and look for the
tarot cards first.

00:17:03.863 --> 00:17:09.562
MATT: Easy enough to find. You have to go through
a few pockets on the inside of the jacket, but you

00:17:09.562 --> 00:17:10.859
eventually find where he keeps them.

00:17:10.859 --> 00:17:18.013
MARISHA: I take those and I keep those to myself.
Take the amulet.

00:17:22.063 --> 00:17:24.133
MATT: Okay, so you have the periapt of wound
closure.

00:17:26.353 --> 00:17:27.577
MARISHA: Toss it to Caleb.

00:17:27.577 --> 00:17:29.729
SAM: You're just going to pick his body off?

00:17:29.729 --> 00:17:34.879
MARISHA: I'm going to take what his dead body
isn't using any more.

00:17:34.879 --> 00:17:40.317
SAM: But he woke up before, maybe we should leave
it with him in case he needs it later.

00:17:40.317 --> 00:17:43.772
MARISHA: I'm going to leave him with everything
else. I don't think we should take his sword.

00:17:43.772 --> 00:17:46.632
LIAM: What do we want to do?

00:17:48.632 --> 00:17:51.850
SAM: Caleb, she's right, we can't fight them.

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:53.090
ASHLY: Cut your losses.

00:17:54.900 --> 00:18:05.752
MARISHA: Not without help, anyway. Did you guys
just suddenly fucking forget that they took Yasha?

00:18:05.752 --> 00:18:08.889
They took Fjord, they took Jester.

00:18:08.889 --> 00:18:18.488
LIAM: That is what I'm talking about. Mollymauk is
dead. Three are not, not yet, and we have invested

00:18:18.488 --> 00:18:28.014
a lot of time into forging this alliance we are
in, Nott. I'm not proposing a head-to-head

00:18:28.014 --> 00:18:35.495
confrontation. Maybe. I want to know where they
are, I want to know what conditions they're in.

00:18:35.495 --> 00:18:40.941
I'm not willing to walk away from this.

00:18:42.701 --> 00:18:44.621
SAM: It would be the smarter bet.

00:18:47.131 --> 00:18:48.229
ASHLY: He's not wrong.

00:18:50.669 --> 00:18:52.030
MARISHA: Fuck you both.

00:18:52.030 --> 00:19:00.466
LIAM: We could live, sure, we could live. We go
hide in the woods. Go back to picking pockets and

00:19:00.681 --> 00:19:06.949
pulling scams on people. You know that I want more
than that.

00:19:10.409 --> 00:19:24.633
MARISHA: Do y'all remember what Molly said a few
weeks ago when he told us that he left every town

00:19:25.065 --> 00:19:31.240
better than what he found it? When he first told
me that, I remember that my first initial knee

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:37.511
jerk reaction was, "You fucking arrogant,
narcissistic bastard, no one can fucking know

00:19:37.511 --> 00:19:52.780
"that." He was an arrogant bastard, but he was
right and do you know how I know? We had a

00:19:52.780 --> 00:20:03.967
conversation last night when we were up for watch,
and he asked me what my greatest lie was and we

00:20:03.967 --> 00:20:17.578
pulled fucking cards for it. Loser would go first.
He told me this story about tricking a town into

00:20:17.578 --> 00:20:26.957
thinking he was royalty, being a king, to pull off
a scam. I was almost going to tell him about my

00:20:26.957 --> 00:20:41.536
childhood, and I didn't. Because he told that
fucking story and I realized: even in his scams,

00:20:41.536 --> 00:20:50.124
when he was doing something shitty, he was still
making people feel good or feel special. The town

00:20:50.124 --> 00:20:58.954
was being visited by-- graced by his presence, by
his royal highness. And I told him this story of

00:20:58.954 --> 00:21:10.777
ruining a couple's lives by extorting them because
I fucking could. Because I fucking felt like it. I

00:21:10.777 --> 00:21:24.387
realized if I can deliberately leave a town
shittier than what I found it, of course he could

00:21:24.387 --> 00:21:33.960
fucking leave a town better than what he found it.
And I'm not going to do that again. I'm not saying

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:42.960
that I'm going to go off and be a fucking hero,
but maybe we can equal out and I can at least not

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:56.549
fuck any more shit up. Take baby steps towards the
leaving the town better... thing. That's the least

00:21:56.549 --> 00:22:04.201
I can do for him. And I'm going to start with
these fuckheads.

00:22:04.201 --> 00:22:05.982
ASHLY: I'll take you there.

00:22:05.982 --> 00:22:07.234
MARISHA: All right.

00:22:11.404 --> 00:22:20.686
LIAM: What are we going to do first? The man
crawled out of a grave once, if he's to be believed.

00:22:21.334 --> 00:22:23.239
MARISHA: Who the fuck is Lucien?

00:22:23.239 --> 00:22:30.697
LIAM: He's done it once, maybe he will do it
again. Do we stay here, do we try to find, I

00:22:30.697 --> 00:22:33.206
don't-- I've read of miracles.

00:22:33.206 --> 00:22:38.219
ASHLY: Look, you guys don't have a lot of time for
your friends. The ones that are captured.

00:22:38.219 --> 00:22:41.893
SAM: We should bury him, and leave some sort of
marker--

00:22:41.893 --> 00:22:42.900
LIAM: A note.

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:54.017
MARISHA: I'm assuming Shadycreek doesn't have high
level priests and the Empire and churches and

00:22:54.017 --> 00:22:59.008
stuff like that. Doesn't sound like the type of
place that has--

00:22:59.008 --> 00:23:01.868
ASHLY: One of the last places you'd find something
like that.

00:23:01.868 --> 00:23:02.276
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:23:02.276 --> 00:23:06.903
MATT: The only things that you would know of
Shadycreek, from your experience, would be

00:23:06.903 --> 00:23:17.875
whatever miracle workers that would exist there
are owned by the tribes, and weird tales of

00:23:17.875 --> 00:23:22.924
strange hermits that live in the forest beyond the
city.

00:23:22.924 --> 00:23:26.495
ASHLY: Okay. But I haven't met anyone directly.

00:23:26.495 --> 00:23:27.651
MATT: Not directly, no.

00:23:27.651 --> 00:23:33.887
LIAM: How many days' travel are we from the
beginning of this journey?

00:23:33.887 --> 00:23:35.795
MATT: From the beginning?

00:23:35.795 --> 00:23:38.847
LIAM: Yeah. From The Gentleman.

00:23:38.847 --> 00:23:43.353
MATT: Close to 17 or so days since you left
Zadash.

00:23:43.353 --> 00:23:45.894
LIAM: We are in the middle of nowhere.

00:23:45.894 --> 00:23:58.242
SAM: Keg, no judgement or anything, but you sort
of froze up in the little fight we had.

00:23:58.242 --> 00:23:59.829
ASHLY: Yeah.

00:24:00.305 --> 00:24:07.463
SAM: When you say you can take us there, are you
just talking about taking us there and dropping us off?

00:24:07.463 --> 00:24:20.527
ASHLY: I'll take you there, I'll help you through.
I'll do what I can.

00:24:20.527 --> 00:24:26.430
SAM: How do we know you won't freeze up again?

00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:28.745
MARISHA: Or cut and run, like you said.

00:24:28.745 --> 00:24:45.338
ASHLY: The way you talk about Molly. I had a
friend like that once, just one. They killed him,

00:24:45.338 --> 00:25:04.565
and I ran then, too. I left him behind: he's the
reason I'm here. I didn't think I would do it

00:25:04.565 --> 00:25:19.403
again, but I did, I fucking froze up. I can't
promise it, but I promise that I'll try. My life

00:25:19.403 --> 00:25:26.217
isn't shit, it's never been. It's kind of the shit
about meeting people that are actually kind is

00:25:26.217 --> 00:25:31.033
that you realize what a fucking nightmare your
life's been before.

00:25:31.033 --> 00:25:40.166
MARISHA: It's funny how the good people can make
assholes like us feel so small.

00:25:40.166 --> 00:25:41.755
ASHLY: Yeah.

00:25:41.755 --> 00:25:45.289
LIAM: You can get us there, though.

00:25:45.289 --> 00:25:47.286
ASHLY: I can get you there.

00:25:47.286 --> 00:25:51.598
LIAM: It does not need to be a frontal assault, we
don't need to throw our lives away.

00:25:51.598 --> 00:25:54.439
SAM: We can't fight them! We can't fight them.

00:25:54.439 --> 00:26:02.271
ASHLY: Here's the thing about Shadycreek Run: it
is a lawless town. If you guys have got coin, then

00:26:02.271 --> 00:26:11.157
people will fight for you. There isn't a lot of
honor there, but there are people that are willing

00:26:11.157 --> 00:26:21.364
to fight if they're incentivized. There might be
people we can gather, at least get intel, there

00:26:21.364 --> 00:26:27.860
might be ways of breaking them out, I don't know.
There are people there that hate the Iron

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:33.352
Shepherds and there are a lot of fucking people
there that are scared of them. It is a long shot.

00:26:33.352 --> 00:26:40.204
I don't think it's unreasonable to say it's a
suicide mission, but if you want to do it, if you

00:26:40.663 --> 00:26:51.021
want to go after them, they don't run the town.
There are people that could be swayed. But you're

00:26:51.021 --> 00:26:52.265
going to need money.

00:26:53.545 --> 00:26:58.236
MARISHA: I go back over to Molly's body and start
finding his coin purse. He's going to sponsor his

00:26:58.236 --> 00:26:59.719
own campaign to resurrection.

00:27:00.799 --> 00:27:18.180
MATT: Okay, on Molly you find 173 gold pieces and
13 silver pieces amongst a cluster of other knick

00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:20.710
knacks and trinkets if you are so interested.

00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:28.674
MARISHA: Nott, want a trinket? To remember Molly
by?

00:27:30.154 --> 00:27:33.393
SAM: Molly said not to steal from happy people.

00:27:38.173 --> 00:27:40.255
MARISHA: Is that what you think I'm doing?

00:27:41.395 --> 00:27:49.007
SAM: Nope. I think you should take everything you
can, but I can't steal from this one.

00:27:53.167 --> 00:27:54.691
MARISHA: I take the money.

00:27:54.691 --> 00:28:02.476
ASHLY: I don't mean to rush you guys, but shit
gets way worse once they get back to The Sour Nest.

00:28:02.476 --> 00:28:12.685
LIAM: I pull out the clay cat's paw and cast
Earthen Grasp and the cat's claw forms out of the

00:28:12.685 --> 00:28:16.926
dirt and I use it to start digging a hole in the
earth.

00:28:16.926 --> 00:28:18.890
MATT: Near one of the hills?

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:28.988
LIAM: Yeah. As the cat's claw starts digging down,
I'm looking for-- the glaive wasn't left, right?

00:28:28.988 --> 00:28:29.744
He took it with him?

00:28:29.744 --> 00:28:30.629
MATT: No, he took it with him.

00:28:30.629 --> 00:28:33.093
LIAM: Sticks, branches, <i>ja</i>?

00:28:33.093 --> 00:28:39.057
MATT: There are branches to the tree that you had
cut down, some of the logs that are there, there

00:28:39.057 --> 00:28:42.285
are some pieces of branch that could be utilized.

00:28:44.435 --> 00:28:45.487
ASHLY: You trying to make firewood?

00:28:45.487 --> 00:28:55.035
LIAM: No. I go to Molly's body and begin to get
the coat off him.

00:28:55.035 --> 00:28:56.075
MATT: Okay.

00:28:58.895 --> 00:29:04.368
LIAM: The claw has about a minute, so hopefully it
can dig something deep enough.

00:29:04.368 --> 00:29:08.797
MATT: I'd say given the size of the claw and its
earthen attachment, it can make, in that minute

00:29:08.797 --> 00:29:11.603
that it has, a fairly functional hole.

00:29:12.953 --> 00:29:18.957
LIAM: Okay. I'm going to start to pull him into
the hole.

00:29:18.957 --> 00:29:20.789
MARISHA: Let's wrap him in his cloth.

00:29:21.949 --> 00:29:28.311
SAM: That's a good idea. We certainly can't carry
it anymore; it's very impractical.

00:29:28.311 --> 00:29:31.622
MARISHA: It was impractical the moment he bought
it.

00:29:31.622 --> 00:29:33.859
SAM: Absolutely. It's a terrible purchase.

00:29:37.089 --> 00:29:39.332
ASHLY: I step back and look away to give them
privacy.

00:29:39.332 --> 00:29:48.356
MATT: Okay. As you guys carefully and respectfully
take the tapestry of the Platinum Dragon, Bahamut,

00:29:48.356 --> 00:29:55.467
and use it to wrap him comfortably, the spell ends
and the hole is complete.

00:29:55.467 --> 00:30:06.550
SAM: Are we leaving his swords? There's one that
can teleport?

00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:11.020
MARISHA: It's a pretty awesome sword, from what I
remember.

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:12.945
SAM: Sure is.

00:30:14.655 --> 00:30:25.043
LIAM: I grab some paper out of my bag and I start
writing a note to Mollymauk, telling him to find

00:30:25.043 --> 00:30:28.605
us through The Gentleman.

00:30:28.605 --> 00:30:30.853
MARISHA: That's a good idea.

00:30:30.853 --> 00:30:38.048
SAM: Tell him his name, too. Or, ooh! We can make
one up.

00:30:38.048 --> 00:30:45.335
MARISHA: (laughs) Mollymauk's pretty unique
and different. It's a good name.

00:30:45.335 --> 00:30:46.294
SAM: All right.

00:30:46.294 --> 00:30:47.718
MARISHA: I take the swords.

00:30:50.388 --> 00:30:51.122
MATT: Okay.

00:30:54.622 --> 00:30:57.361
MARISHA: Or, at least, is there one fancy one and
one basic one?

00:30:57.361 --> 00:31:04.051
MATT: I mean, they're both pretty fancy, but one
of them is a brass, gold color. It's the one that

00:31:04.051 --> 00:31:06.267
you had found not too long ago.

00:31:06.267 --> 00:31:08.150
SAM: That's the one.

00:31:08.150 --> 00:31:09.534
MATT: The Summer's Dance.

00:31:09.534 --> 00:31:14.969
MARISHA: Yeah, we'll take that one. Summer's
Dance. We'll give it back to him if he comes back

00:31:14.969 --> 00:31:15.506
to us.

00:31:15.506 --> 00:31:16.652
SAM: It's a loan! It's a loan.

00:31:16.652 --> 00:31:19.964
MARISHA: Well, and also, there might be grave
robbers.

00:31:19.964 --> 00:31:22.358
SAM: Yeah, fuck those guys, right?

00:31:22.358 --> 00:31:24.240
MARISHA: Looters, yeah.

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:36.386
LIAM: I take that note and I stick it into the
lapel of the folds of his clothes, and I brush the

00:31:36.386 --> 00:31:46.382
hair out of his face, and then I start to push
soil back over the body.

00:31:46.382 --> 00:31:47.218
MARISHA: I help him.

00:31:48.998 --> 00:31:55.765
SAM: Should we say some words or anything?

00:32:02.485 --> 00:32:03.489
MARISHA: Pour a drink?

00:32:04.529 --> 00:32:07.445
SAM: Sure. I'll pour drinks.

00:32:11.545 --> 00:32:13.253
MARISHA: Long may he reign.

00:32:15.493 --> 00:32:16.509
SAM: Long may he reign.

00:32:20.279 --> 00:32:21.700
MARISHA: That's the best fucking shit I got.

00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:27.244
LIAM: Shine bright, circus man.

00:32:29.044 --> 00:32:39.867
SAM: I think you're supposed to say things about
how good they were and how many people loved them,

00:32:39.867 --> 00:32:48.307
and what a wonderful life they had, but I don't
think any of those things are true, or at least we

00:32:48.307 --> 00:32:50.927
don't-- I don't think he even knew.

00:32:53.037 --> 00:33:01.695
LIAM: Caleb sighs and takes a five-foot, six-foot
sturdy branch, one that could be a walking stick,

00:33:01.695 --> 00:33:08.412
and I take that stone-- that lucky rock that I
found-- and I start to hammer the branch into the

00:33:08.412 --> 00:33:16.528
ground so it is sticking up like a post, and then
hang Mollymauk's coat from it.

00:33:19.038 --> 00:33:20.564
SAM: That'll be stolen, though.

00:33:22.784 --> 00:33:31.502
LIAM: Not right away. If he comes up out of the
ground, it will be here waiting for him in a day

00:33:31.502 --> 00:33:32.068
or two.

00:33:34.018 --> 00:33:38.914
MARISHA: Maybe you should write another note and
leave it on the coat that says, "Don't fucking

00:33:38.914 --> 00:33:44.395
"steal this, you fucking looter assholes. Dead
guy's buried here."

00:33:44.395 --> 00:33:47.372
LIAM: I think we will just leave the coat,
Beauregard.

00:33:47.372 --> 00:33:57.990
MARISHA: I feel like a note could be very
convincing, but that's fair. All right, let's go.

00:33:59.310 --> 00:34:01.503
SAM: Go after them?

00:34:03.563 --> 00:34:08.229
LIAM: Well, we do not have to decide what we are
going to do right away. We could have an

00:34:08.229 --> 00:34:15.186
opportunity, grab our friends. We don't need to
rush into the lion's den. Let's see what we are

00:34:15.186 --> 00:34:24.720
looking at, what we are dealing with. We get our
three friends back. We have not traveled with them

00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:27.097
this far to throw it away.

00:34:29.227 --> 00:34:41.162
SAM: To throw what away? I want to hear you say
it. Why do you want to go after them?

00:34:48.182 --> 00:34:50.500
LIAM: Their deaths would be a waste.

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:56.037
SAM: Wrong. Why?

00:35:05.917 --> 00:35:08.282
LIAM: Caleb storms off into the woods.

00:35:11.882 --> 00:35:12.753
MARISHA: Keg.

00:35:15.433 --> 00:35:16.185
ASHLY: Beau?

00:35:16.185 --> 00:35:18.298
MARISHA: Thank you.

00:35:18.298 --> 00:35:20.920
ASHLY: For what?

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:31.772
MARISHA: I think we all would have been dead back
there had you not made your offer, which you

00:35:31.772 --> 00:35:37.605
didn't have to do. It's noted.

00:35:39.885 --> 00:35:45.198
ASHLY: A bit too little, too late, but sure,
yeah.

00:35:45.198 --> 00:35:47.994
MARISHA: What was your friend's name?

00:35:50.334 --> 00:35:51.539
ASHLY: Yuto.

00:35:55.889 --> 00:35:58.618
MARISHA: No more running. For Molly and Yuto.
Deal?

00:36:02.328 --> 00:36:04.661
ASHLY: Deal.

00:36:06.107 --> 00:36:08.730
SAM: If you run, we'll kill you.

00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:10.892
ASHLY: That's fair.

00:36:10.892 --> 00:36:11.922
SAM: Cool.

00:36:13.585 --> 00:36:15.275
ASHLY: Bad time to ask for a drink?

00:36:15.752 --> 00:36:18.400
MARISHA: Never a bad time.

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.663
SAM: You deserve it.

00:36:20.663 --> 00:36:26.970
MATT: Caleb, you've stormed off, a bit around the
way to the little bit of scrub and a few trees off

00:36:27.325 --> 00:36:35.323
to the side, where the horses are set. There's a
new horse standing there, one that wasn't with the

00:36:35.323 --> 00:36:37.074
rest of your trio.

00:36:37.074 --> 00:36:38.802
MARISHA: It's a spy!

00:36:38.802 --> 00:36:40.360
MATT: Medium brown in color.

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:41.397
MARISHA: Kill it!

00:36:41.397 --> 00:36:49.547
SAM: (cooing)

00:36:49.547 --> 00:36:52.017
LIAM: I'm in the open right now with the horses,
yeah?

00:36:52.017 --> 00:36:53.476
MATT: Yeah. It's looking right at you.

00:36:53.476 --> 00:36:59.565
LIAM: The horse is? There's no person around?

00:36:59.565 --> 00:37:01.684
MATT: No other person that you see, no.

00:37:07.894 --> 00:37:10.760
LIAM: I walk up to the front of the horse.

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:14.176
MATT: It clomps up, meeting your step with each
step you take.

00:37:14.176 --> 00:37:19.803
LIAM: Oh. Who are you, <i>Freund</i>?

00:37:19.803 --> 00:37:30.830
MATT: Its outer shoulders and well-traveled,
muscled body begins to shift and change before

00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:39.281
you. Its form in some ways pulls in, others extend
outward. Sumalee, if you'd like to join us at the

00:37:39.281 --> 00:37:39.957
table, please.

00:37:39.957 --> 00:37:43.188
(cheering)

00:37:43.188 --> 00:37:46.478
SAM: You said "Sumalee," not "So Molly," right?

00:37:46.478 --> 00:37:47.228
MATT: Right.

00:37:47.228 --> 00:37:50.029
MARISHA: That's so Molly.

00:37:50.029 --> 00:37:52.159
MATT: Welcome!

00:37:52.159 --> 00:37:53.262
LIAM: Hi, welcome!

00:37:53.262 --> 00:37:54.839
ASHLY: Hi, Sumalee!

00:37:54.839 --> 00:38:01.574
SAM: Wow! You have to do a Mr. Ed voice.

00:38:01.574 --> 00:38:04.635
MATT: Make sure you scoot in enough for the
camera, there.

00:38:04.635 --> 00:38:05.104
SUMALEE: Okay.

00:38:05.104 --> 00:38:12.390
MARISHA: We're jumping in a bouncy funhouse over
here! We're having a grand old time!

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:13.648
ASHLY: Oh, it's just been a laugh!

00:38:13.648 --> 00:38:14.609
MARISHA: Just so great!

00:38:14.609 --> 00:38:22.010
MATT: If you'd like to describe what Caleb sees as
the horse is no more, and there's now a person

00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:23.444
standing before him.

00:38:25.674 --> 00:38:38.181
SUMALEE: I'm a firbolg. I've shifted into about a
seven-and-a-half-foot tall firbolg. I weigh about

00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:50.251
200 pounds, and I'm wearing some
Mongolian-inspired, almost like a shepherd. I have

00:38:50.251 --> 00:39:05.758
a round face, a wide nose. No pointy ears, though.
My ears are soft, and floppy. I stand tall,

00:39:05.758 --> 00:39:16.883
strong. My shoulders droop a little forward. I'm
looking with big, round eyes at all of you.

00:39:19.583 --> 00:39:23.899
LIAM: Hey, that's a pretty good trick.

00:39:23.899 --> 00:39:26.300
SUMALEE: Thank you.

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:29.673
LIAM: You're out for a stroll?

00:39:29.673 --> 00:39:33.568
SUMALEE: I've been watching you.

00:39:35.388 --> 00:39:42.125
LIAM: Oh, <i>gut.</i> How long have you-- You are very
tall.

00:39:42.125 --> 00:39:47.047
SUMALEE: Not for my clan. I am just average.

00:39:47.047 --> 00:39:54.452
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i> Okay. Did you see everything that
happened in here in the last 20 minutes or so?

00:39:58.202 --> 00:40:02.858
SUMALEE: I am sorry for your loss.

00:40:05.938 --> 00:40:10.200
LIAM: Hey guys, we have a visitor!

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:12.884
MARISHA: I thought you were talking to yourself
again.

00:40:12.884 --> 00:40:14.385
ASHLY: What kind of visitor?

00:40:14.385 --> 00:40:20.549
MATT: You glance over and you see the extremely
tall female form of this firbolg; humanoid with a

00:40:20.549 --> 00:40:31.626
face that comes to a deer-like shape to the front,
floppy ears, looming over, looking right at Caleb,

00:40:31.626 --> 00:40:34.100
who's taking a step back and looking up towards
her.

00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:35.002
ASHLY: Holy shit.

00:40:35.002 --> 00:40:35.537
MARISHA: Oh.

00:40:35.537 --> 00:40:38.076
LIAM: Um.

00:40:38.076 --> 00:40:41.531
SAM: Hi.

00:40:41.531 --> 00:40:42.513
SUMALEE: Hello.

00:40:42.513 --> 00:40:43.114
SAM: Ah!

00:40:43.114 --> 00:40:44.845
ASHLY: You all right, Caleb?

00:40:44.845 --> 00:40:52.630
LIAM: Yes, I just was not expe-- you know, we've
been through-- It's been a long day.

00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:55.011
MARISHA: Yeah, you're not like a shared
hallucination, right?

00:40:55.011 --> 00:40:57.938
SUMALEE: No, I assure you, I am not.

00:40:57.938 --> 00:41:06.025
LIAM: You don't have any holy abilities, by any
chance?

00:41:06.025 --> 00:41:17.653
SUMALEE: I do not know this word "holy," but I
have abilities, which I might like to share with you.

00:41:18.124 --> 00:41:23.808
LIAM: Well, if you've been watching, we have just
buried a friend of ours, maybe we were premature.

00:41:23.808 --> 00:41:25.149
Should we go dig him up?

00:41:25.149 --> 00:41:27.004
SAM: Can you bring dead people back to life?

00:41:27.004 --> 00:41:30.620
SUMALEE: No, I'm sorry.

00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:33.016
LIAM: That's a stupid question from me, I
apologize.

00:41:33.016 --> 00:41:42.896
SAM: It was worth a shot, right? I mean. You would
have kicked yourself if you hadn't asked and later

00:41:42.896 --> 00:41:44.483
she was like, "Oh yeah, by the way."

00:41:44.483 --> 00:41:47.401
LIAM: She probably would have offered though, you
know.

00:41:47.401 --> 00:41:56.851
MARISHA: We ran into a tribe on the way here, you
wouldn't happen to know an older woman named

00:41:56.851 --> 00:41:58.005
Jumnda would you?

00:41:59.725 --> 00:42:03.551
SUMALEE: Yes. She is my elder.

00:42:03.551 --> 00:42:05.547
SAM: They all know each other, I knew it!

00:42:05.547 --> 00:42:06.846
MARISHA: Nott, that's--

00:42:06.846 --> 00:42:09.730
SAM: Do you know Pumat Sol?

00:42:11.770 --> 00:42:12.553
SUMALEE: No.

00:42:15.243 --> 00:42:16.179
MARISHA: (laughing) You're terrible.

00:42:16.179 --> 00:42:19.605
SUMALEE: What did Jumnda say?

00:42:19.605 --> 00:42:31.654
MARISHA: She said a strong woman on a mission to
go find her son, part of her clan, was heading

00:42:31.654 --> 00:42:38.766
north. Would you happen to be Nila? Or is it
Ny-la? Am I pronouncing that right?

00:42:38.766 --> 00:42:39.573
SAM: It was Nila.

00:42:39.573 --> 00:42:40.893
MARISHA: It was Nila? Nila.

00:42:40.893 --> 00:42:42.423
SUMALEE: You had it right the first time.

00:42:42.423 --> 00:42:43.317
MARISHA: Nailed it.

00:42:46.147 --> 00:42:49.965
SUMALEE: I am Nila. It is nice to meet you all.

00:42:49.965 --> 00:42:51.768
SAM: It's nice to meet you too.

00:42:51.768 --> 00:42:52.984
MARISHA: It's nice to meet you.

00:42:52.984 --> 00:43:00.337
SAM: We met your friends. Family? Tribe? Clan?

00:43:00.337 --> 00:43:01.970
SUMALEE: All of those work.

00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:05.449
(laughter)

00:43:07.179 --> 00:43:13.154
SAM: They told us that you're trying to find the
same people we are. I think? You're trying to find

00:43:13.154 --> 00:43:17.073
these folks who kidnapped someone who you know?

00:43:17.073 --> 00:43:31.753
SUMALEE: I wasn't sure if I could trust you, but
seeing as how I saw what you went through, I could

00:43:31.753 --> 00:43:33.167
use a little help too.

00:43:33.167 --> 00:43:40.728
LIAM: <i>Ja,</i> how are you feeling about your chances
now, after watching the bloodbath?

00:43:44.688 --> 00:43:54.363
SUMALEE: I think I might have some abilities that
can help, but I knew I could not do it alone, and

00:43:54.363 --> 00:43:56.298
I saw you have abilities, too.

00:43:56.298 --> 00:43:59.920
MARISHA: On our good days.

00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:02.409
ASHLY: What abilities are you talking about?

00:44:02.409 --> 00:44:06.134
LIAM: She was a horse a moment ago.

00:44:06.134 --> 00:44:09.245
ASHLY: What?! You buried the lede there, Caleb!

00:44:09.245 --> 00:44:11.555
(laughter)

00:44:11.555 --> 00:44:13.338
SUMALEE: Did you not get that?

00:44:13.338 --> 00:44:17.057
ASHLY: No! I thought Caleb-- I mean, he kind of
talks to himself.

00:44:17.057 --> 00:44:24.145
SUMALEE: Right. I forgot. I was a horse.

00:44:24.145 --> 00:44:28.178
SAM: So we have an extra horse!

00:44:28.178 --> 00:44:32.550
SUMALEE: I can make other animal shapes, too.

00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:35.838
SAM: Ooh! Caleb can turn his cat into a bird!

00:44:35.838 --> 00:44:37.460
SUMALEE: Wow!

00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:41.752
LIAM: It is a little trick. Can you turn yourself
into anything dangerous?

00:44:41.752 --> 00:44:50.688
SUMALEE: I think the most dangerous I can be is a
crocodile.

00:44:50.688 --> 00:44:51.856
MARISHA: That's pretty dangerous.

00:44:51.856 --> 00:44:54.275
SAM: We fought those. One almost killed me.

00:44:54.275 --> 00:44:57.264
ASHLY: Not the same crocodile, right?

00:44:57.264 --> 00:44:58.619
SAM: Was it you?

00:44:58.619 --> 00:45:05.473
SUMALEE: No! I never leave. This is the first time
I've left my family.

00:45:05.473 --> 00:45:08.260
LIAM: Have you ever been in a fight?

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:12.334
SUMALEE: Not really.

00:45:12.334 --> 00:45:13.164
ASHLY: Oh, great.

00:45:13.164 --> 00:45:20.245
SUMALEE: But I have other abilities that I might
be able to use to help! There's one in particular

00:45:20.245 --> 00:45:24.496
that I want to use against these evil people.

00:45:24.496 --> 00:45:28.181
SAM: You can curse in front of us if you need to,
I mean.

00:45:28.181 --> 00:45:30.944
SUMALEE: What is this "cursing?"

00:45:30.944 --> 00:45:31.760
ASHLY: Oh god.

00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:38.474
SAM: I think you'll pick it up if you hang around
us for more than an afternoon.

00:45:38.474 --> 00:45:43.919
SUMALEE: Anyway, I have some abilities that I'd
like to use on these bad people.

00:45:43.919 --> 00:45:45.195
ASHLY: Killing abilities?

00:45:45.195 --> 00:45:45.840
SUMALEE: Yes.

00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:47.624
ASHLY: Are you willing to kill?

00:45:47.624 --> 00:45:48.178
SUMALEE: Yes.

00:45:48.178 --> 00:45:51.679
ASHLY: Can you say the word "fuck" for me?

00:45:51.679 --> 00:45:56.344
SUMALEE: I do not know what it means, but "fuck."

00:45:56.344 --> 00:46:01.523
ASHLY: Great, all right. Well, she's got a little
bit of edge.

00:46:01.942 --> 00:46:03.611
MARISHA: I like her. I like her a lot.

00:46:03.611 --> 00:46:04.681
SAM: Hardcore.

00:46:04.681 --> 00:46:10.533
SUMALEE: You do not understand what they did to my
family. I am ready now.

00:46:10.533 --> 00:46:14.529
SAM: Please tell us. I mean, if it's not horribly
awful to tell.

00:46:14.529 --> 00:46:22.716
SUMALEE: I just want to say that I'm ready. I'm
ready to do things that I've never done before. To

00:46:22.716 --> 00:46:27.906
use my abilities to get my son back.

00:46:27.906 --> 00:46:30.011
SAM: Son?

00:46:30.011 --> 00:46:40.236
ASHLY: I know I'm the proven coward of this group,
but do we want an untested horse-person coming

00:46:40.236 --> 00:46:40.933
with us?

00:46:40.933 --> 00:46:42.732
SUMALEE: Why would you not?

00:46:42.732 --> 00:46:46.655
ASHLY: You saw the fight, right, lady?

00:46:46.655 --> 00:46:49.666
SUMALEE: Yes. I can help.

00:46:49.666 --> 00:46:54.072
ASHLY: It's up to you guys. It's your funeral.

00:46:54.072 --> 00:46:57.172
SAM: Your son has been captured?

00:46:57.172 --> 00:47:09.842
SUMALEE: And my partner. Jumnda, the lady you ran
into, my elder, she told me not to come, not to

00:47:09.842 --> 00:47:28.730
leave. "Accept nature's fate," she said. But I
cannot. I have been kind and peaceful and to

00:47:28.730 --> 00:47:40.665
myself many years. No more. You need me and I
cannot do this alone.

00:47:40.665 --> 00:47:41.705
ASHLY: Need you?

00:47:41.705 --> 00:47:44.312
MARISHA: She's kind of right.

00:47:44.312 --> 00:47:53.775
LIAM: Hey, over there is a tree stump on the side
of the road. That's the bald one. What do you do?

00:47:56.225 --> 00:47:57.534
MARISHA: Show us.

00:47:57.534 --> 00:48:09.004
SUMALEE: I will tell you because I cannot do it
all the time, but when I am ready, I will summon

00:48:09.004 --> 00:48:24.458
lightning from the sky and fry him, destroy him!
And I can do it again and again and again!

00:48:24.458 --> 00:48:26.653
LIAM: That sounds good.

00:48:26.653 --> 00:48:27.762
MARISHA: That sounds great.

00:48:27.762 --> 00:48:29.822
SAM: We'd appreciate that.

00:48:29.822 --> 00:48:31.636
ASHLY: So moving?

00:48:31.636 --> 00:48:32.666
MARISHA: Holy shit.

00:48:32.666 --> 00:48:34.367
LIAM: What time of the day is it?

00:48:34.367 --> 00:48:35.591
MATT: It's early morning.

00:48:35.591 --> 00:48:36.664
SAM: Metal o'clock.

00:48:36.664 --> 00:48:38.659
MATT: Apparently!

00:48:38.659 --> 00:48:40.864
LIAM: The fight was in the early morning.

00:48:40.864 --> 00:48:43.355
MATT: The fight was right at dawn.

00:48:43.355 --> 00:48:44.200
LIAM: Right, okay.

00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:50.325
MATT: It's maybe an hour after sunrise at this
point, and the sky is still mostly clouded and

00:48:50.563 --> 00:48:55.943
becoming lighter. The flurry is coming closer,
there is a gentle snowfall coming down at this

00:48:55.943 --> 00:48:56.737
early hour.

00:48:56.737 --> 00:49:00.854
SUMALEE: I can do the lightning trick any time of
day.

00:49:00.854 --> 00:49:02.441
ASHLY: That's good to know.

00:49:02.441 --> 00:49:05.542
MARISHA: Yeah, good for me.

00:49:05.542 --> 00:49:12.690
SAM: Do you drink? Alcohol? Booze?

00:49:12.690 --> 00:49:20.346
SUMALEE: There are some tree saps, when left for a
long time, they have a funny taste to them.

00:49:20.346 --> 00:49:22.041
Sometimes I taste that, but--

00:49:22.041 --> 00:49:23.890
SAM: Okay, more for us.

00:49:23.890 --> 00:49:25.621
ASHLY: Better not.

00:49:25.621 --> 00:49:29.028
LIAM: Can I borrow your flask, please?

00:49:29.028 --> 00:49:30.871
SAM: Yeah, sure, here.

00:49:30.871 --> 00:49:35.308
SUMALEE: So we will join together.

00:49:35.308 --> 00:49:43.339
SAM: If you're going after your son, I trust you
100%. What was his name?

00:49:43.339 --> 00:49:45.701
SUMALEE: Asar.

00:49:48.921 --> 00:49:50.763
LIAM: How old is your boy?

00:49:50.763 --> 00:49:53.541
SUMALEE: He's only five.

00:49:53.541 --> 00:49:55.297
ASHLY: Jesus.

00:49:56.967 --> 00:50:00.318
SAM: Maybe that's fully grown for a firbolg?

00:50:00.318 --> 00:50:01.192
SUMALEE: No.

00:50:01.192 --> 00:50:03.424
SAM: Okay. It was worth a shot.

00:50:03.424 --> 00:50:04.746
ASHLY: Good thinking.

00:50:06.406 --> 00:50:09.403
MARISHA: All right. We should keep heading on to
Shadycreek then.

00:50:12.173 --> 00:50:13.627
SAM: Yes, we should.

00:50:13.627 --> 00:50:20.854
ASHLY: Anything else you want to, I don't know, do
for your friend?

00:50:20.854 --> 00:50:21.942
SAM: Oh.

00:50:23.012 --> 00:50:23.817
MARISHA: No.

00:50:26.047 --> 00:50:27.086
ASHLY: All right.

00:50:29.076 --> 00:50:39.384
SUMALEE: May I suggest something? When someone
dies in my clan, we know that their spirit never

00:50:39.384 --> 00:50:50.890
leaves. It just gets returned to nature, which is
why we protect nature so fiercely. I have lost

00:50:50.890 --> 00:51:02.762
people before. I find ways to see them in nature.
Sometimes the leaves on the trees-- I pick one

00:51:02.762 --> 00:51:12.867
leaf and I know that it is a spirit waving to me.
Your friend is here. He has not left.

00:51:16.107 --> 00:51:17.528
SAM: That is very lovely.

00:51:20.348 --> 00:51:26.685
MARISHA: Yeah. I'm going to go start mounting up
the horses.

00:51:26.685 --> 00:51:37.051
MATT: You gather the last of your things, retrieve
the horses, and head out.

00:51:37.051 --> 00:51:41.748
ASHLY: I'll lead the horses, since I know where
I'm going.

00:51:41.748 --> 00:51:42.404
MATT: Okay.

00:51:42.404 --> 00:51:47.940
SAM: Yeah, we have three horses-- oh wait, you had
one too. Wait, did you? No, you were on foot. We

00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:48.926
had three left.

00:51:48.926 --> 00:51:50.998
MATT: Yeah, you had three left after the previous
battle.

00:51:50.998 --> 00:51:52.202
ASHLY: I have to ride on one by myself.

00:51:52.202 --> 00:51:54.472
MATT: Correct. You guys can double up.

00:51:54.472 --> 00:51:57.857
MARISHA: Yeah, it was you two doubled up and I had
one.

00:51:57.857 --> 00:52:03.517
SAM: You are probably going to have to share-- Do
you have a horse?

00:52:03.517 --> 00:52:04.526
SUMALEE: I can be a horse.

00:52:04.526 --> 00:52:05.910
SAM: Oh, you are a horse! Of course.

00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:11.723
SUMALEE: I can turn into a horse once more. But if
I do, I think that is the last time I can do it today.

00:52:12.277 --> 00:52:13.668
MATT: Until you take a rest.

00:52:13.668 --> 00:52:14.844
SUMALEE: Until my next rest.

00:52:14.844 --> 00:52:16.345
LIAM: Horse nap.

00:52:16.345 --> 00:52:24.611
MATT: As you guys gather up onto your horses, Keg
takes the lead and you all begin your trek

00:52:24.611 --> 00:52:33.622
northward once more. Both memory of Mollymauk
behind you on one shoulder, and the image of the

00:52:33.622 --> 00:52:40.785
face of your vengeance before you. You continue on
your journey for the next hour or so before you

00:52:40.785 --> 00:52:44.826
catch a glance, Keg, at the road above. You see
three shapes in the road.

00:52:44.826 --> 00:52:47.132
ASHLY: Can I perception check it?

00:52:47.132 --> 00:52:48.014
MATT: Perception check.

00:52:48.014 --> 00:52:50.566
ASHLY: That's a 13.

00:52:50.566 --> 00:52:55.815
MATT: 13? You get a little closer and you look and
it looks to be three figures that are left in the

00:52:55.815 --> 00:52:59.900
road. People left in the road.

00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:00.599
ASHLY: Dead?

00:53:00.599 --> 00:53:01.731
MATT: Not moving.

00:53:01.731 --> 00:53:08.131
ASHLY: Guys, there's something in the road.

00:53:08.131 --> 00:53:10.205
MARISHA: Oh, fuck.

00:53:10.205 --> 00:53:12.774
ASHLY: I can't tell if they are dead from here.

00:53:12.774 --> 00:53:17.195
LIAM: I send Frumpkin up into the air as an owl.

00:53:17.195 --> 00:53:24.459
MATT: Swoops down and does a few loops over it and
within a moment of scanning, can see it is three

00:53:24.459 --> 00:53:32.094
bodies. A human man appears to be in his forties,
a younger half-elven man in his twenties, and a

00:53:32.094 --> 00:53:38.148
young human woman, probably in her twenties, early
thirties or so. They are all slain, but there is

00:53:38.148 --> 00:53:43.389
no sign of traumatic wounds or any damage to their
body, though they are damp.

00:53:43.389 --> 00:53:44.570
ASHLY: Damp?

00:53:44.570 --> 00:53:45.262
MATT: Damp.

00:53:45.262 --> 00:53:50.833
MARISHA: Is it snowing-- Is there snow on the
ground?

00:53:50.833 --> 00:53:54.418
MATT: There is snow on the ground. You can see
there's bits that are gathered on them.

00:53:54.418 --> 00:53:56.330
ASHLY: Why would they just be left in the road?

00:53:56.330 --> 00:54:01.203
SAM: Caleb has told us all of this?

00:54:01.203 --> 00:54:01.770
LIAM: Yes.

00:54:01.770 --> 00:54:06.538
SAM: I am going to scout up ahead and see if I
recognize them.

00:54:06.538 --> 00:54:10.563
MATT: Okay, make a medicine check for one thing as
you glance at the bodies.

00:54:10.563 --> 00:54:12.859
SAM: 12, plus zero.

00:54:12.859 --> 00:54:21.764
MATT: Not too bad. You recognize the man as the
one you saw in the cage before you, and at a quick

00:54:21.764 --> 00:54:30.767
glance you can see elements of flash frostbite on
parts of their skin. You gather they are probably

00:54:30.767 --> 00:54:32.687
the ones that were in the cage in front of you.

00:54:32.687 --> 00:54:37.858
MARISHA: Does it look like they tried to escape
the cage?

00:54:37.858 --> 00:54:41.926
SAM: They were dead when the frost blast hit
everybody.

00:54:41.926 --> 00:54:43.309
MARISHA: Then they dumped the bodies.

00:54:43.309 --> 00:54:52.906
ASHLY: Well given that he left them in the middle
of the road-- think this is his second warning?

00:54:52.906 --> 00:54:56.481
Third? Fourth?

00:54:56.481 --> 00:54:59.386
SAM: Or maybe he just wanted to move fast without
extra weight.

00:54:59.386 --> 00:55:01.841
MARISHA: I think he just cares that little for
human life.

00:55:01.841 --> 00:55:07.569
SAM: Well, we'll cut out their tongues for food
and then bury them?

00:55:07.569 --> 00:55:09.971
ASHLY: Nott, with the fucking tongues again, my
man.

00:55:09.971 --> 00:55:10.837
SAM: What, it's protein.

00:55:10.837 --> 00:55:15.613
ASHLY: Look, I know you're weird, but if you could
tone it down just a skosh.

00:55:15.613 --> 00:55:19.588
SAM: You don't have to watch.

00:55:19.588 --> 00:55:23.142
ASHLY: I'll hear it. You're so loud.

00:55:23.142 --> 00:55:25.134
SAM: Fine.

00:55:25.134 --> 00:55:28.991
LIAM: I'm pulling the first of the three off the
road to the side.

00:55:28.991 --> 00:55:30.062
ASHLY: I help.

00:55:30.062 --> 00:55:31.615
MARISHA: I'll help.

00:55:31.615 --> 00:55:34.813
MATT: You manage to pull the bodies off the road
into the grasses on the side.

00:55:34.813 --> 00:55:35.494
ASHLY: Nott!

00:55:35.494 --> 00:55:43.548
SAM: Don't worry. There's other tongues in the
sea.

00:55:43.558 --> 00:55:46.358
(laughter)

00:55:46.358 --> 00:55:50.842
MATT: You do know, Keg, looking at the road,
you're about at the point where you diverge from

00:55:51.129 --> 00:55:56.809
the path to follow up the road but continue on to
Nogvurot, but to head to the Quannah Breach, and

00:55:56.809 --> 00:56:00.751
eventually Shadycreek Run, is due north from where
you stand.

00:56:00.751 --> 00:56:07.374
ASHLY: Do I know of any ways to not go through the
front gates? Is there any sort of circumventing I

00:56:07.374 --> 00:56:07.942
could do?

00:56:07.942 --> 00:56:11.326
MATT: Unfortunately, not without adding another
week or so travel through the mountains.

00:56:11.326 --> 00:56:13.753
ASHLY: Ugh, okay. Never mind, then.

00:56:13.753 --> 00:56:18.205
MATT: It's possible, but it's a treacherous
journey to move through the Dunrock Mountains to

00:56:18.205 --> 00:56:18.542
get there.

00:56:18.542 --> 00:56:28.848
SAM: When we arrive, they may have left word to
look out for us. They know what we look like. We

00:56:28.848 --> 00:56:35.307
should have some sort of disguise. I know that you
and I can disguise ourselves. You can--

00:56:35.307 --> 00:56:37.274
SUMALEE: I can too.

00:56:37.274 --> 00:56:43.168
ASHLY: Beau and I are SOL.

00:56:43.168 --> 00:56:46.609
MARISHA: Yeah. I have my cool reversible cloak.

00:56:46.609 --> 00:56:52.870
SUMALEE: I can make you disappear for a while.

00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:56.515
ASHLY: That would probably be good. How long?

00:56:56.515 --> 00:56:57.835
SUMALEE: One hour.

00:56:57.835 --> 00:57:00.314
ASHLY: How long does it take to get to
Shadycreek?

00:57:00.314 --> 00:57:04.046
MATT: From where you are now, it's a little under
two days travel.

00:57:04.046 --> 00:57:07.155
SAM: When we get to the gates, we could maybe
just--

00:57:07.155 --> 00:57:07.915
ASHLY: Slip in.

00:57:07.915 --> 00:57:13.021
MATT: You do know that just beyond the Breach,
there is a gate that is guarded by one of the

00:57:13.021 --> 00:57:16.201
families of the tribes. There is a toll that's
taken as you pass through.

00:57:16.201 --> 00:57:18.327
ASHLY: Okay. That would probably be a good idea.

00:57:18.327 --> 00:57:20.603
SUMALEE: I can do that.

00:57:20.603 --> 00:57:21.937
ASHLY: Thanks.

00:57:21.937 --> 00:57:31.285
SAM: For you, we'll find a fake mustache or
something?

00:57:31.285 --> 00:57:33.487
LIAM: Are you able to do just one person?

00:57:33.487 --> 00:57:37.571
SUMALEE: No, I think I'm able to do--

00:57:37.571 --> 00:57:39.197
LIAM: Could you do the whole group?

00:57:39.197 --> 00:57:41.756
SUMALEE: Yes, I can, right?

00:57:41.756 --> 00:57:43.732
SAM: Right, God?

00:57:43.732 --> 00:57:48.649
(laughter)

00:57:48.649 --> 00:57:51.577
MARISHA: Is it Pass Without a Trace you're looking
at?

00:57:51.577 --> 00:57:55.064
MATT: That can help them hide if they want.

00:57:55.064 --> 00:58:01.583
MARISHA: Yes, so as long as we stay within 30 feet
of you, we get plus ten to our stealth bonus,

00:58:01.583 --> 00:58:03.239
which would be very helpful.

00:58:03.239 --> 00:58:05.896
SAM: We don't turn invisible.

00:58:05.896 --> 00:58:07.286
MARISHA: Correct.

00:58:07.286 --> 00:58:09.249
MATT: If anybody wants to hide, it does help out.

00:58:09.249 --> 00:58:11.940
SAM: You guys could hide under the horses or
something.

00:58:11.940 --> 00:58:12.632
ASHLY: Okay.

00:58:15.072 --> 00:58:17.202
MARISHA: That's badass. I like that.

00:58:17.202 --> 00:58:23.548
MATT: Keg leading on to the north, you diverge
from the Glory Run Road, heading into the high

00:58:23.865 --> 00:58:30.005
grasses of the North Marrow Valley. You continue
on for the better part of the day, taking breaks

00:58:30.005 --> 00:58:34.684
as necessary, and for you to recover your forms.
You continue pushing on-- not at a breakneck pace

00:58:34.684 --> 00:58:39.408
for fear of catching up to your quarry, but enough
where you know at least you are keeping pace.

00:58:39.408 --> 00:58:46.871
Eventually the light of the sky begins to grow dim
as the evening calls to you, at which point the

00:58:46.871 --> 00:58:55.683
flurry has come. The snow begins to get heavier,
the darkness is darker than normal at dusk and the

00:58:55.683 --> 00:59:00.006
air gets bitter cold. What do you wish to do to
set camp?

00:59:00.006 --> 00:59:05.314
SAM: Do we still have the tents? Did we keep the
tents? We have the tents.

00:59:05.314 --> 00:59:06.274
LIAM: We've taken everything, yeah.

00:59:08.784 --> 00:59:11.131
ASHLY: Can I see through the dark with my night
vision?

00:59:11.131 --> 00:59:15.070
MATT: You can see up to a 60-foot distance I
believe, and it's a dim light.

00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:19.641
ASHLY: Are there any structures around?

00:59:19.641 --> 00:59:21.810
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:59:21.810 --> 00:59:23.047
ASHLY: 19.

00:59:23.047 --> 00:59:31.661
MATT: Pretty decent. The hills here-- you don't
see any structures per se, but if you take a

00:59:31.661 --> 00:59:36.881
moment to walk around, you do see one hill that
has a bank that is eroded, and there is a bit of

00:59:36.881 --> 00:59:44.861
an outcropping that may be about three or four
feet outward. If you were to all crowd in, it

00:59:44.861 --> 00:59:50.879
might be able to prevent piercing wind and/or
continuous snowfall, but it would be pretty cozy.

00:59:50.879 --> 00:59:53.478
ASHLY: Do you guys feel like cuddling?

00:59:53.478 --> 00:59:55.924
MARISHA: Share body heat, keeps us warmer.

00:59:55.924 --> 00:59:57.437
LIAM: Ugh.

01:00:03.097 --> 01:00:07.516
ASHLY: I'll keep watch. I'm kind of wide, so
you'll have more room.

01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:12.279
SAM: Okay. Let's cuddle.

01:00:12.279 --> 01:00:20.338
MATT: You guys gather up here on the underside of
this outcropping of the hill. Who's taking first

01:00:20.601 --> 01:00:23.326
watch? You, Keg? Make a perception check for your
watch, please.

01:00:23.326 --> 01:00:28.416
MARISHA: Beau tries to get a spot next to Nila
because she's large and fuzzy.

01:00:28.416 --> 01:00:29.578
ASHLY: 15.

01:00:29.578 --> 01:00:38.038
MATT: Looking out towards the distance, as
everyone else is silently sleeping in a cuddled,

01:00:38.038 --> 01:00:47.641
spoon-like position at times, you glance out and
see a few shapes moving past. You see a few stars

01:00:47.641 --> 01:00:53.673
blink out as shadows move past. You quietly lean
forward and begin to inspect and your eyes focus

01:00:53.673 --> 01:01:02.354
at the outset of your darkvision. You notice a
small set of goats that are roving the plain,

01:01:02.354 --> 01:01:07.923
making their way. The snow is falling and they're
trying to find themselves to warmer climate.

01:01:07.923 --> 01:01:09.139
LIAM: Were-goats.

01:01:09.139 --> 01:01:11.296
MATT: You don't know that.

01:01:11.296 --> 01:01:13.154
ASHLY. Dangerous, violent were-goats.

01:01:13.154 --> 01:01:22.439
MATT: You don't find any other threat or anything
during your watch. Next watch?

01:01:22.439 --> 01:01:24.289
MARISHA: I'll take it.

01:01:24.289 --> 01:01:26.372
MATT: Beau, make a perception check.

01:01:26.372 --> 01:01:33.087
MARISHA: Six total.

01:01:33.087 --> 01:01:36.266
MATT: Everything seems pretty kosher.

01:01:36.266 --> 01:01:38.970
MARISHA: I'm a little zoned out.

01:01:38.970 --> 01:01:45.230
MATT: During your watch is when the heavy part of
the storm begins to hit. No thunder. It's just

01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:50.414
very cold and you can see your breath, and you're
having to involuntarily shiver as the cold kicks

01:01:50.414 --> 01:01:58.091
in. You can see now the snow piling up and you're
thankful, at this moment, that you found this

01:01:58.091 --> 01:02:04.725
outcropping in Keg's vision, because the distant
hills that are open are now heavily piling with

01:02:04.725 --> 01:02:10.796
this soft, powdered snow. It's starting to fall
and the wind is pushing through and some of it's

01:02:10.796 --> 01:02:14.668
hitting the left side of your face. It's starting
to go a little numb and you have to brush it off

01:02:14.668 --> 01:02:20.371
every now and then and try to do your best to dry
up the biting cold water that is melting against

01:02:20.371 --> 01:02:25.187
your cheek. Nevertheless, your watch comes to an
end without an issue. Who wants to take the final watch?

01:02:25.187 --> 01:02:26.118
SAM: I will.

01:02:26.118 --> 01:02:27.444
LIAM: You and me, goblina.

01:02:27.444 --> 01:02:28.129
SAM: Sure.

01:02:28.129 --> 01:02:31.041
MATT: Make a perception check for me, please?

01:02:31.041 --> 01:02:32.862
SAM: Oh boy. Four.

01:02:32.862 --> 01:02:41.248
MATT: Well, you're lucky, because nothing of note
happens during your watch. You are nervously

01:02:41.248 --> 01:02:45.897
keeping your eyes out, just in case, waiting for
another reverse ambush, but nothing seems to catch

01:02:45.897 --> 01:02:50.368
your attention. As the morning comes to, because
you guys managed to cuddle, I would like you all

01:02:50.368 --> 01:02:53.020
to make a constitution saving throw with
advantage, please.

01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:56.610
SAM, MARISHA, and ASHLY: Cuddle-vantage!

01:02:56.610 --> 01:02:57.548
ASHLY: Oh, both terrible.

01:02:57.548 --> 01:03:00.387
SAM: Both for me, too.

01:03:00.387 --> 01:03:06.592
SAM: I rolled a two and a two, so four.

01:03:06.592 --> 01:03:10.892
MARISHA: Is this a saving throw or just a check?

01:03:10.892 --> 01:03:12.048
MATT: Constitution saving throw.

01:03:12.048 --> 01:03:17.420
SAM: I do have my winter clothes. I bought them.
Just laying that out.

01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:23.931
MATT: I'll say the winter clothes and the
closeness of the group-- sure. I'll say you've

01:03:23.931 --> 01:03:30.598
avoided, in your hearty goblin form-- You're used
to rough weather, anyway.

01:03:30.598 --> 01:03:33.274
LIAM: Sam, you're bonier than Gollum.

01:03:33.274 --> 01:03:36.191
MATT: Keg, in full metal armor, not so much.

01:03:36.191 --> 01:03:37.821
ASHLY: I add my modifier though, yes?

01:03:37.821 --> 01:03:38.892
MATT: You do add your modifier.

01:03:38.892 --> 01:03:40.285
ASHLY: Then it's actually 15.

01:03:40.285 --> 01:03:42.658
MATT: Yeah, you're fine. You shrug it off without
issue.

01:03:42.658 --> 01:03:43.920
LIAM: 21.

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:46.119
MATT: Caleb, your warm coat keeps you warm.

01:03:46.119 --> 01:03:47.330
LIAM: Hearty German living.

01:03:47.330 --> 01:03:49.913
MATT: Exactly. You're used to these Zemnian
nights.

01:03:49.913 --> 01:03:51.225
MARISHA: 12.

01:03:51.225 --> 01:03:54.196
MATT: That's enough to withstand it, not a
problem.

01:03:54.196 --> 01:03:55.672
SUMALEE: 21.

01:03:55.672 --> 01:04:01.921
MATT: While the forest definitely keeps insulation
to the storm, your body is well suited for extreme

01:04:01.921 --> 01:04:07.832
weather as well. Actually-- tricksy winter
clothes, but you got it.

01:04:07.832 --> 01:04:08.805
SAM: No, you can--

01:04:08.805 --> 01:04:15.697
MATT: No, you got them for a reason. That's what
they're there for. Because of the body heat and

01:04:15.697 --> 01:04:16.727
everything, I'll allow it.

01:04:16.727 --> 01:04:21.196
LIAM: You're like the little kid in A Christmas
Story, "I can't put my arms down!"

01:04:21.196 --> 01:04:22.636
MARISHA: So cute.

01:04:22.636 --> 01:04:31.772
MATT: As you guys continue your trek northward for
the next day, you slowly push forward and watch as

01:04:32.061 --> 01:04:38.352
the rolling hills of this northern valley begin to
even out. The high grasses growing dense and

01:04:38.352 --> 01:04:44.153
dusted with snow in the wake of this snowstorm
that has passed through the night. It's now this

01:04:44.153 --> 01:04:52.448
beautiful, ice topped wonderland before you. As
the storm is past, breaks in the clouds begin to

01:04:52.448 --> 01:04:59.452
slowly emerge and show you glimmers of blue in the
sky. With sunlight comes a welcome comparative warmth,

01:04:59.452 --> 01:05:09.004
and this dusted field of diamonds begins to slowly
thaw over the midday's journey. The looming peaks

01:05:09.004 --> 01:05:16.214
of the Dunrock mountain range approach closer,
engulfing your horizon almost like a toothy jaw of

01:05:16.214 --> 01:05:23.497
some ancient titan that surrounds your peripheral.
You can make out, as you get closer, the craggy

01:05:23.497 --> 01:05:29.786
break in the mountains ahead, familiar to you.
It's like a spiral fracture of a bone, where

01:05:29.786 --> 01:05:36.712
suddenly what was once a solid mountain range
seems to have torn and sundered into two separate

01:05:36.712 --> 01:05:46.198
ravines that seem to share a similar shape. This
you recognize as the Quannah Breach. You guys

01:05:46.198 --> 01:05:55.080
begin to approach, by mid to late afternoon, the
front of the breach, where you can see six

01:05:55.080 --> 01:06:01.631
crownsguard in a small outpost built at the base
of the Quannah Breach. These, as you know, are

01:06:01.631 --> 01:06:05.217
usually folks that essentially warn people from
traveling into the Breach, and if they do, let

01:06:05.217 --> 01:06:12.727
them know that any return is going to be probably
highly searched and highly inquired. They enforce

01:06:12.727 --> 01:06:17.193
it, unless you slip them some coin. Then it's not
an issue on the way back. They're more there to

01:06:17.193 --> 01:06:18.889
make money.

01:06:18.889 --> 01:06:20.530
ASHLY: For appearances, yeah.

01:06:20.530 --> 01:06:28.328
MATT: As you approach, familiar to you, a
crownsguard begins to put a hand up to the

01:06:28.732 --> 01:06:30.623
approaching horses and say, "Hail!"

01:06:30.623 --> 01:06:32.417
ASHLY: Oh, goddamn it.

01:06:32.417 --> 01:06:35.431
MATT: "Where are you traveling to?"

01:06:35.431 --> 01:06:37.932
ASHLY: Shadycreek.

01:06:37.932 --> 01:06:42.224
MATT: "You have business in these cursed lands?"

01:06:42.224 --> 01:06:44.371
ASHLY: Yeah, we're trying to get fucked. Can we
move along?

01:06:44.371 --> 01:06:50.486
MATT: "Well, your life is your own, as is your
business, but you must understand that coming back

01:06:50.486 --> 01:06:54.901
"is no easy task. A thorough search and inquiry
into your person will be required--"

01:06:54.901 --> 01:06:58.472
ASHLY: Yeah, blah, blah, blah. Can I give you a
couple of coins and you let us on our way, please?

01:06:58.472 --> 01:07:02.869
MATT: "Very well." How much do you give him?

01:07:02.869 --> 01:07:05.663
ASHLY: How little will he take?

01:07:05.663 --> 01:07:09.854
MATT: Customary to your experience and the times
that you've traveled with the Iron Shepherds, it's

01:07:09.854 --> 01:07:11.808
usually about two gold to just pass.

01:07:11.808 --> 01:07:12.825
ASHLY: Okay, yeah.

01:07:12.825 --> 01:07:17.606
MATT: He takes it and quietly lets you pass. Per
person.

01:07:17.606 --> 01:07:24.622
SAM: Molly would want us to do this trip, maybe
Molly should pay.

01:07:24.622 --> 01:07:27.350
MARISHA: Yeah, Molly pays the toll.

01:07:27.350 --> 01:07:29.626
SAM: Thank you, Molly.

01:07:29.626 --> 01:07:35.435
MARISHA: Two, four, six, eight, ten. Love you,
Taliesin.

01:07:35.435 --> 01:07:38.110
MATT: Well, eight, because she pays herself.

01:07:38.110 --> 01:07:40.814
SAM: Yeah, Molly wouldn't want to pay for Keg.

01:07:40.814 --> 01:07:42.766
SUMALEE: Thank you.

01:07:42.766 --> 01:07:43.984
ASHLY: As he shouldn't.

01:07:43.984 --> 01:07:46.570
SUMALEE: I have gold pieces I can use later, too,
if you want them.

01:07:46.570 --> 01:07:51.417
ASHLY: You're not going to want to spend any of
that in Shadycreek Run. There's nothing there for you.

01:07:51.417 --> 01:07:52.525
SAM: Why, they don't take money? Oh.

01:07:52.525 --> 01:07:56.735
ASHLY: It's just not a nice place.

01:07:56.735 --> 01:08:07.389
SAM: When you're home with your people, are you
one of the nicer ones, or are you a bad girl at

01:08:07.389 --> 01:08:10.144
home? What's your-- how does it--

01:08:10.144 --> 01:08:21.895
SUMALEE: I don't know. I am one of the ones that--
not too many people rely on me.

01:08:21.895 --> 01:08:24.313
SAM: They don't rely on you?

01:08:24.313 --> 01:08:25.534
SUMALEE: No.

01:08:25.534 --> 01:08:26.897
SAM: Why?

01:08:26.897 --> 01:08:39.716
SUMALEE: I think I am-- There was always some
firbolg that was more powerful, stronger, smarter.

01:08:39.716 --> 01:08:56.987
More capable. Eventually I grew to accept being
myself, and I prefer to support rather than be a

01:08:56.987 --> 01:09:11.001
leader. This is my first time trying to be more
than who I am.

01:09:11.001 --> 01:09:19.042
ASHLY: Keg does one of these to her in support.

01:09:19.042 --> 01:09:29.795
SUMALEE: I do not know what that is, but I like
it. And I heard you use the word "fuck" again.

01:09:29.795 --> 01:09:39.508
MARISHA: You know, maybe people don't rely on you
because you haven't been given the chance yet.

01:09:39.508 --> 01:09:43.268
We're certainly going to rely on you.

01:09:43.268 --> 01:09:46.304
SUMALEE: That makes me happy.

01:09:46.304 --> 01:09:52.475
MARISHA: It'll be a good test run, at least, for
you. Then you can go back to your tribe and be

01:09:52.475 --> 01:09:55.920
like, "Yo, people relied on me!"

01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:59.695
ASHLY: "It was dope!"

01:09:59.695 --> 01:10:02.479
MARISHA: "It was great, you should rely on me
more!"

01:10:02.479 --> 01:10:03.545
ASHLY: "It was super tight!"

01:10:03.545 --> 01:10:04.505
MARISHA and ASHLY: Yeah.

01:10:04.505 --> 01:10:07.749
MARISHA: I don't know. They probably won't sound
like that.

01:10:07.749 --> 01:10:10.274
LIAM: I kick my horse along.

01:10:10.274 --> 01:10:17.673
MATT: As you travel through these winding ravines,
choosing the one to the right, which you know to

01:10:18.129 --> 01:10:23.634
be the wider of the two, the low howl of the wind
that's traversing these sheared twisted walls,

01:10:23.634 --> 01:10:31.380
like a haunting, whistling, and moan sound. It
accompanies the brush growing more dense. The air

01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:37.557
grows colder still, as white banks of snow and ice
frame various ledges and outcroppings along these

01:10:37.557 --> 01:10:45.167
strangely curved and smoothly sheared cliffsides.
It feels like a giant had grabbed a mountain range

01:10:45.167 --> 01:10:52.173
and tore it in two and there's an even break on
each side. It winds and curves. It's like a

01:10:52.173 --> 01:11:03.673
natural labyrinth. A few miles through this
strange maze, you're met with a makeshift wall and

01:11:03.673 --> 01:11:09.759
a ten-foot wooden gate. Your eyes, at first,
notice a few dozen wooden poles carved into spikes

01:11:09.759 --> 01:11:14.468
that emerge from the ground, pointed in your
direction from the base, many of which are stained

01:11:14.468 --> 01:11:23.391
dark while others still bear the weathered skulls
of warning. Three armored folk stand there; two

01:11:23.391 --> 01:11:27.936
human men and a half-orc woman all bearing weapons
and watching you carefully as you approach.

01:11:27.936 --> 01:11:29.407
ASHLY: This isn't the gate, right?

01:11:29.407 --> 01:11:30.346
MATT: This is the gate.

01:11:30.346 --> 01:11:31.098
ASHLY: Oh, it is?

01:11:31.098 --> 01:11:37.190
MATT: You've reached the edge of the Quannah
Breach and turned to the final bastion outside of

01:11:37.190 --> 01:11:38.511
the Empire.

01:11:38.511 --> 01:11:40.630
ASHLY: But it's not the gate into Shadycreek Run.

01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:44.066
MATT: It's the gate into the region of Shadycreek
Run.

01:11:44.066 --> 01:11:46.446
SAM: This is the gate we need to hide in?

01:11:46.446 --> 01:11:47.153
MATT: This is.

01:11:47.153 --> 01:11:48.279
ASHLY: But they see us?

01:11:48.279 --> 01:11:50.869
MATT: Well, they've noticed you begin to turn and
approach--

01:11:50.869 --> 01:11:52.533
SAM: Quick, hide! Hide, quick!

01:11:52.533 --> 01:11:54.705
MATT: You would know this is coming because you've
traveled this before.

01:11:54.705 --> 01:11:56.080
ASHLY: Okay, so we wouldn't have turned the
corner.

01:11:56.080 --> 01:12:00.296
MATT: I'm describing it as you-- or you're
describing it as you're about to turn the corner.

01:12:00.296 --> 01:12:01.390
ASHLY: Okay.

01:12:01.390 --> 01:12:02.490
LIAM: Rewind the tape just a little bit.

01:12:02.490 --> 01:12:03.885
ASHLY: (rewinds) So!

01:12:03.885 --> 01:12:06.658
SAM: So that's just literally around this corner?

01:12:06.658 --> 01:12:13.488
ASHLY: Just right around-- If we went even just a
few feet that way, whoo whee! Guards, big old

01:12:13.488 --> 01:12:15.427
gate. It would have been-- oh, man.

01:12:15.427 --> 01:12:17.270
LIAM: We were going at a pretty good pace there.

01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:22.619
ASHLY: You guys are lucky that I stopped just a
few feet right before we would have all seen the

01:12:22.619 --> 01:12:29.179
gate. You're welcome. You know, I'm really earning
my keep here. So!

01:12:29.179 --> 01:12:31.892
SAM: So hide! Or something, right?

01:12:31.892 --> 01:12:35.138
ASHLY: The plan was you guys can make yourselves
look different?

01:12:35.138 --> 01:12:35.691
SAM: Yes.

01:12:35.691 --> 01:12:40.368
ASHLY: Then you're going to make us invisible and
then you're going to be a horse?

01:12:40.368 --> 01:12:42.160
SUMALEE: I can do that.

01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:45.425
ASHLY: I'll get used to that eventually. Okay.
Cool.

01:12:45.425 --> 01:12:50.525
MARISHA: You guys are going to have three horses
and then two riders.

01:12:50.525 --> 01:12:53.984
ASHLY: Do we have stuff to put on the third horse
to make it look like a pack?

01:12:53.984 --> 01:12:57.115
LIAM: Yeah. We could just take everything off our
horses and gather it.

01:12:57.115 --> 01:12:57.708
MARISHA: Okay.

01:12:57.708 --> 01:12:58.227
LIAM: Yeah?

01:12:58.227 --> 01:12:59.166
ASHLY: Yeah.

01:12:59.166 --> 01:13:05.863
MARISHA: We'll hide under the horse like Indiana
Jones-style, basically? Holding on underneath?

01:13:05.863 --> 01:13:08.449
Okay, that's going to take some grip strength, but
I'm into it.

01:13:08.449 --> 01:13:13.211
SAM: Wait! Maybe if one of our horses is a pack
horse, you could be on top of the horse wrapped in

01:13:13.211 --> 01:13:16.909
a blanket or something. You're part of the gear
that the horse is carrying.

01:13:16.909 --> 01:13:18.843
MARISHA: Do they search you on the way in?

01:13:18.843 --> 01:13:19.339
SAM: Oh.

01:13:19.339 --> 01:13:20.615
ASHLY: Do they search us on the way in?

01:13:20.615 --> 01:13:22.713
MATT: Depends on if you pay them on the way
through.

01:13:22.713 --> 01:13:24.250
ASHLY: We'll have to pay them.

01:13:24.250 --> 01:13:26.322
SAM: We can pay.

01:13:26.322 --> 01:13:30.541
ASHLY: Yeah. I think this one's a little bit more
expensive, though. Isn't it? Probably. The deeper

01:13:30.773 --> 01:13:31.762
we get in? Or is it the same?

01:13:31.762 --> 01:13:36.941
MATT: You know that the previous gate-- Generally
you don't have to pay them, the one you entered?

01:13:36.941 --> 01:13:42.274
It just helps you with "no questions asked" issue.
This is the gate run by the Uteloch family of the

01:13:42.274 --> 01:13:48.567
tribes and they enforce it both as a means of
making money and to know who's coming and going.

01:13:48.567 --> 01:13:50.404
ASHLY: Mm-hmm. Okay.

01:13:50.404 --> 01:13:54.531
MATT: So it's an equal price to what you were
paying previously.

01:13:54.531 --> 01:13:56.155
ASHLY: We should definitely pay it, though.

01:13:56.155 --> 01:14:03.933
SAM: Which plan do we want? You hiding under the
horses or you hiding on the horse as suitcases?

01:14:03.933 --> 01:14:05.502
ASHLY: I can hide under the horse.

01:14:05.502 --> 01:14:08.725
MARISHA: I'll hide as suitcase. I'll be a bundle.

01:14:08.725 --> 01:14:14.538
LIAM: We lie you over the horse and we put a bunch
of shit on top of you, yeah?

01:14:14.538 --> 01:14:15.158
SAM: Okay.

01:14:15.158 --> 01:14:22.276
LIAM: Then you are going to do some sort of horse
magic that makes us-- sorry, I'm unclear.

01:14:22.276 --> 01:14:23.415
Invisible or--?

01:14:23.415 --> 01:14:24.999
MARISHA: More stealthy.

01:14:24.999 --> 01:14:31.135
SUMALEE: You are invisible to people. To others.

01:14:31.135 --> 01:14:32.230
SAM: I believe that.

01:14:32.230 --> 01:14:39.004
SUMALEE: You don't have to change shape.

01:14:39.004 --> 01:14:44.167
ASHLY: It might be helpful so there's not--

01:14:44.167 --> 01:14:45.513
SAM: You can make us totally invisible.

01:14:45.513 --> 01:14:46.229
SUMALEE: I think so!

01:14:46.229 --> 01:14:47.992
MARISHA: You give us a bonus to our stealth.

01:14:47.992 --> 01:14:49.186
SAM: Ask your god.

01:14:49.186 --> 01:14:50.352
LIAM: You cannot.

01:14:50.352 --> 01:14:51.027
SUMALEE: Aw.

01:14:51.027 --> 01:14:54.054
LIAM: But what you can do, it's still useful
here.

01:14:54.054 --> 01:14:56.003
MARISHA: Is it makes us more hideable.

01:14:56.003 --> 01:15:01.045
LIAM: If the people who are hiding try to look
like-- covered in cloth and shit and try to look

01:15:01.045 --> 01:15:01.830
like cloth--

01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:02.545
SUMALEE: It'll pass.

01:15:02.545 --> 01:15:03.528
LIAM: You can make it more believable.

01:15:03.528 --> 01:15:06.385
MARISHA: You know the blanket in Lord of the
Rings?

01:15:06.385 --> 01:15:07.269
SUMALEE: Yes.

01:15:07.269 --> 01:15:07.886
MARISHA: The cloak--

01:15:07.886 --> 01:15:08.874
SUMALEE: On the raft.

01:15:08.874 --> 01:15:09.786
MARISHA: It's like that.

01:15:09.786 --> 01:15:12.448
SUMALEE: Got it. I will turn the blankets into--

01:15:12.448 --> 01:15:14.846
MARISHA: Rocky things. Sounds good.

01:15:14.846 --> 01:15:18.464
LIAM: This whole pow wow was happening around the
bend.

01:15:18.464 --> 01:15:21.106
ASHLY: Guards are like--

01:15:21.106 --> 01:15:26.348
SUMALEE: Wait, what happens after we get through,
though?

01:15:26.348 --> 01:15:28.175
SAM: Then we can do whatever we want.

01:15:28.175 --> 01:15:29.667
LIAM: No, we keep going for a while--

01:15:29.667 --> 01:15:31.153
ASHLY: It will be a little bit of a ride.

01:15:31.153 --> 01:15:34.853
LIAM: Keep up appearances. Yeah? You're going
carry these two. They're both going to lie on top

01:15:34.853 --> 01:15:36.141
of your horseback.

01:15:36.141 --> 01:15:40.124
ASHLY: I can't be on a horse. Just me. I'm too
heavy.

01:15:40.124 --> 01:15:41.013
LIAM: Too heavy?

01:15:41.013 --> 01:15:43.274
ASHLY: I'll break her. Right? Because I can't--

01:15:43.274 --> 01:15:44.928
MATT: A single horse you can do.

01:15:44.928 --> 01:15:51.373
ASHLY: A single horse I could be on. It couldn't
be me and Beau. Or me and one of you.

01:15:51.373 --> 01:15:53.013
LIAM: She's like all sticks, though.

01:15:53.013 --> 01:15:58.630
MATT: With Beau it's possible. Not at a full run,
but at a travel journey, you could probably do it.

01:15:58.630 --> 01:16:01.121
MARISHA: Or I could be a pack on one of your guys'
horse.

01:16:01.121 --> 01:16:02.524
LIAM: She could be on our horse.

01:16:02.524 --> 01:16:03.504
SAM: Yes, yes.

01:16:03.504 --> 01:16:05.101
LIAM: Because you and I are skin and bones.

01:16:05.101 --> 01:16:07.224
ASHLY: I'll be on top of you, if that's okay.

01:16:07.224 --> 01:16:09.013
SUMALEE: That's fine.

01:16:09.013 --> 01:16:09.501
ASHLY: Okay.

01:16:09.501 --> 01:16:11.854
SUMALEE: And I will make you Pass Without a
Trace.

01:16:11.854 --> 01:16:19.836
MATT: In this shady ravine, just as it comes to an
end before entering this next valley, the shadows

01:16:19.836 --> 01:16:27.098
seem to coalesce and cling to you and where
previously the light itself is shaded and dim.

01:16:27.098 --> 01:16:30.578
It's almost like you're stepping through
moonlight.

01:16:30.578 --> 01:16:33.835
MARISHA: Almost like?

01:16:33.835 --> 01:16:38.850
MATT: Well, meaning like looking at those of you
in the radius, it's like it's nighttime where

01:16:38.850 --> 01:16:43.316
you're standing. The shadows are heavier. The
blacks are crushed.

01:16:43.316 --> 01:16:46.960
ASHLY: We've both got stuff on top of us to make
us look like--

01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:49.022
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. I'm wrapped in a bedroll.

01:16:49.022 --> 01:16:57.980
LIAM: <i>Ja</i> I mutter a few words and suddenly look
like an old coot with a band of hair around the

01:16:57.980 --> 01:17:04.907
sides and my jaw is off to the side a bit and it's
missing a few teeth and very squinty. That's me.

01:17:04.907 --> 01:17:06.467
MATT: Like Robert Duvall, good.

01:17:06.467 --> 01:17:07.736
LIAM: Yeah, that's it.

01:17:07.736 --> 01:17:11.645
SAM: I will mutter a few words and turn into--

01:17:11.645 --> 01:17:13.532
ASHLY: What was this drawing back here?

01:17:13.532 --> 01:17:14.945
SAM: Oh, which one?

01:17:14.945 --> 01:17:16.585
ASHLY: Penis man.

01:17:16.585 --> 01:17:20.796
LIAM: Stop the game! What's the drawing? Hold it
up.

01:17:20.796 --> 01:17:22.144
ASHLY: Sorry, out of character. Excuse me.

01:17:22.144 --> 01:17:23.184
LIAM: Let's see!

01:17:23.184 --> 01:17:27.898
SAM: It's a dick man with a drink.

01:17:27.898 --> 01:17:32.501
(laughter)

01:17:32.501 --> 01:17:35.305
SAM: It was a me and Laura collab.

01:17:35.305 --> 01:17:40.123
LIAM: Somebody was talking, having a moment. Then
you draw a dick man.

01:17:40.123 --> 01:17:42.890
SAM: I'll make myself look like Rissa.

01:17:42.890 --> 01:17:44.831
MATT: Okay, perfect.

01:17:44.831 --> 01:17:47.412
SAM: Because I know that one.

01:17:47.412 --> 01:17:49.510
LIAM: Rissa and Robert Duvall.

01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:54.363
MATT: Those of you who are trying to be
inconspicuous, which would be Beau and Keg, go

01:17:54.363 --> 01:17:55.584
ahead and make general stealth checks.

01:17:55.584 --> 01:17:56.823
MARISHA: Plus ten, right?

01:17:56.823 --> 01:17:58.772
ASHLY: Come on, baby. That's not great. Nine.

01:17:58.772 --> 01:18:00.833
MARISHA: Add ten to your roll your plus stealth.

01:18:00.833 --> 01:18:01.927
ASHLY: Oh, 19.

01:18:01.927 --> 01:18:03.632
MATT: That is what the spell does.

01:18:03.632 --> 01:18:05.225
ASHLY: I see.

01:18:05.225 --> 01:18:09.457
MARISHA: It's not good for me either. 21 with the
buff.

01:18:09.822 --> 01:18:10.953
SAM: Thank god for the buff.

01:18:10.953 --> 01:18:11.501
ASHLY: Woo!

01:18:11.501 --> 01:18:18.531
MATT: Okay, as you guys turn the corner, you now
see the gate and the spikes and the warning skulls

01:18:18.531 --> 01:18:19.317
and everything.

01:18:19.317 --> 01:18:22.828
SAM: It's not as good as you described it.

01:18:22.828 --> 01:18:28.588
ASHLY: I don't know a lot of adjectives. I'm not a
great storyteller. I said it's a gate and there

01:18:28.588 --> 01:18:33.630
are people there. What else do you need to know?
You need the fucking colors and the designs.

01:18:33.630 --> 01:18:37.352
SAM: You had smells and you had shapes and
everything, but this is--

01:18:37.352 --> 01:18:39.218
LIAM: Shut the fuck up!

01:18:39.218 --> 01:18:45.993
MATT: As you approach, the half-orc steps forward
and goes, "Hey, you! Where you headed today?"

01:18:49.253 --> 01:18:51.066
SAM: Shadycreek Run.

01:18:51.066 --> 01:18:54.580
MATT: "Well, you pass through the breach, you pay
the toll."

01:18:54.580 --> 01:18:55.373
SAM: All right.

01:18:55.373 --> 01:18:56.762
LIAM: Yes, we have that.

01:18:56.762 --> 01:18:58.384
MATT: "Good. Pay up."

01:18:58.384 --> 01:19:00.726
SAM: How much?

01:19:00.726 --> 01:19:02.776
MATT: "Two gold each."

01:19:02.776 --> 01:19:05.584
LIAM: Oh yeah. Okay.

01:19:05.584 --> 01:19:12.423
SAM: You know what? I'll get it. Don't even look.
I got this one. Here you go, four from me.

01:19:12.423 --> 01:19:13.850
MARISHA: Yeah, that's good.

01:19:13.850 --> 01:19:22.761
MATT: "All right. Let them in!" She steps back in
line with the two other they pull the two gates

01:19:23.124 --> 01:19:31.404
and pull open as the wood clacks against the sides
of the gates. You all make your way through as the

01:19:31.404 --> 01:19:38.142
guards watch as you pass in. For a nervous moment,
you see the eyes pass over the two other riders,

01:19:38.142 --> 01:19:47.977
but make no issue as you continue inward. You hear
the gates (clunking) behind you. Now, looking

01:19:47.977 --> 01:19:53.779
ahead, you can see the curvature of the ravine
opens up into a widening valley. You see a

01:19:53.779 --> 01:20:00.010
limitless forest of climbing pines, spruce-like
trees, only the common green you expect stands

01:20:00.010 --> 01:20:09.566
instead an unexpected purple-gray in color. This
wide blanket before you of this deep valley of

01:20:09.566 --> 01:20:17.596
fading purple and gray color at the tops of theses
trees. Along the tree line, you can see a

01:20:17.596 --> 01:20:23.583
sprawling and matted line of snow-capped
buildings, hovels, and mud-covered streets that

01:20:23.583 --> 01:20:30.801
vanish into this dense forest. The city does not
keep the normal cohesive shape of most, instead

01:20:30.801 --> 01:20:37.835
being a long line built along the tree edge and
some sort of river or creek that it has been

01:20:37.835 --> 01:20:48.473
constructed against. It is a weird, crooked, long
town that vanishes into the branches and leaves.

01:20:48.473 --> 01:20:56.316
You're no longer within the Dwendalian Empire.
Welcome to the Greying Wildlands.

01:20:56.316 --> 01:20:58.251
SAM: The Greying Wildlands.

01:20:58.251 --> 01:21:08.190
MATT: And to the lawless town of Shadycreek Run.
Anything you wish to do before you head to the

01:21:08.190 --> 01:21:09.821
city proper?

01:21:09.821 --> 01:21:12.554
ASHLY: We're still obscured, Beau and I?

01:21:12.554 --> 01:21:15.775
MATT: Obscured in the sense that you're
inconspicuous in dress.

01:21:15.775 --> 01:21:19.052
ASHLY: Right, but that's still happening? That
spell is for an hour? Okay.

01:21:19.052 --> 01:21:21.529
LIAM: Do you have any place where we can lay up?

01:21:21.529 --> 01:21:36.319
ASHLY: There are two places I would recommend.
There is this place called the Plaza Emporium. A

01:21:36.319 --> 01:21:42.057
pleasant but can be murderous dragonborn runs
that. She's not affiliated with any of the

01:21:42.057 --> 01:21:47.272
unseemly folks directly, so she's a bit more
neutral. We might be able to get information from her.

01:21:47.272 --> 01:21:49.026
LIAM: Does she murder everybody or does--

01:21:49.026 --> 01:22:01.717
ASHLY: Only people who piss her off, so be on your
best behavior. The Landlocked Lady is a brothel.

01:22:01.717 --> 01:22:08.778
We might want to cover Nila's eyes. It's run by
the Marduns, who happen to be--

01:22:08.778 --> 01:22:11.142
SAM: That's who we're looking for.

01:22:11.142 --> 01:22:16.309
ASHLY: And they are the rival family of the folks
that employ the Iron Shepherds.

01:22:16.309 --> 01:22:21.264
SAM: That seems like where we should go, because
the Iron Sheps won't be there to poke around and

01:22:21.264 --> 01:22:21.751
find us.

01:22:21.751 --> 01:22:23.136
LIAM: That is correct.

01:22:23.136 --> 01:22:25.505
MARISHA: What is the name of that place again?

01:22:25.505 --> 01:22:27.750
ASHLY, LIAM, and SAM: The Landlocked Lady.

01:22:27.750 --> 01:22:34.206
ASHLY: The proprietor is kind of a skeeze ball, as
you would imagine. Not necessarily the most

01:22:34.206 --> 01:22:42.285
trustworthy guy, but it is run by the Marduns. So
of the safe places in the town, that's probably up there.

01:22:42.285 --> 01:22:47.385
LIAM: Are you still laying across the back of a
horse or have you pulled yourself up?

01:22:47.385 --> 01:22:50.721
ASHLY: I have a little opening that I made for
myself.

01:22:50.721 --> 01:22:53.095
(laughter)

01:22:53.095 --> 01:22:56.721
ASHLY: It's just my face with a cigarette still.

01:22:59.431 --> 01:23:00.363
MATT: This little--

01:23:00.363 --> 01:23:03.962
SAM: Our horse is smoking.

01:23:06.942 --> 01:23:07.802
MARISHA: Amazing.

01:23:07.802 --> 01:23:10.686
SAM: I vote Landlocked Lady.

01:23:10.686 --> 01:23:11.649
LIAM: Of course.

01:23:11.649 --> 01:23:14.093
MARISHA: (muffled) I agree.

01:23:14.093 --> 01:23:16.736
SAM and MATT: All right.

01:23:16.736 --> 01:23:20.848
SAM: Lead us there with smoke signals.

01:23:20.848 --> 01:23:22.776
ASHLY: That way.

01:23:22.776 --> 01:23:31.980
MATT: A short ride you eventually hit the outside
of this township. Walking into the main street,

01:23:31.980 --> 01:23:37.934
you can see they're slick with mud and dirty snow.
Ragged peasants clutter the alleyways, looking

01:23:37.934 --> 01:23:42.560
your way with hands extended for some sort of alms
they're hoping to find.

01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:43.897
LIAM: (spits)

01:23:43.897 --> 01:23:45.215
SAM: Ugh, gross.

01:23:45.215 --> 01:23:49.709
MATT: An emaciated dog growls at you from a nearby
doorstep and then darts off down the road behind

01:23:50.003 --> 01:23:55.389
where you passed. A wagon appears stuck in the mud
as you pass it, rough-looking folk tugging at it

01:23:55.389 --> 01:24:03.359
and stopping to stare you down as you slowly move
past. They continue their work. You nearly step

01:24:03.359 --> 01:24:10.032
over someone with your horse who appears to be
passed out, face down in a patch of dirty snow. A

01:24:10.032 --> 01:24:17.141
bit of crimson rests at their side. They're not
moving. As you circle around them you watch as two

01:24:17.141 --> 01:24:24.019
rough-looking fellows in hide clad armor come and
inspect him. As you glance over your shoulder, you

01:24:24.019 --> 01:24:29.334
watch as they rummage through his pockets, lift up
his not moving body and dump him in one of the

01:24:29.334 --> 01:24:35.363
nearby alleys and keep on walking. You see no
Crownsguard.

01:24:35.363 --> 01:24:36.551
SAM: Oh man.

01:24:36.551 --> 01:24:44.829
MATT: This is the first town any of you have been
in that has no watch. No law keepers. The road

01:24:44.829 --> 01:24:52.242
doesn't go far north from where you enter as most
of the town is this long stretched bar, so within

01:24:52.242 --> 01:25:00.599
15 minutes you've hit the plaza. The central plaza
to the town that you know as the Clover Plaza. You

01:25:00.599 --> 01:25:06.322
see log benches dotting the open area, while a
four story tower of motley colored stones stands

01:25:06.322 --> 01:25:11.949
vigil over the area. Two balconies and a top,
housing crossbow and longbow wielding roughnecks.

01:25:11.949 --> 01:25:23.670
You know these to be Taskers. You're heading
towards The Landlocked Lady? Easy to see. On the

01:25:23.670 --> 01:25:33.276
eastern side of this plaza, there is a very
beautiful, two story complex, that comparably

01:25:33.276 --> 01:25:38.849
seems ostentatious against the buildings
immediately to the right and left of it which look

01:25:38.849 --> 01:25:45.439
to be in serious disrepair and rather rundown and
colorless. Just bland woods, gray and brown. Here

01:25:45.439 --> 01:25:52.972
you can see the second story above the main archway,
a curved top arch, there is a false bow of a

01:25:52.972 --> 01:26:00.604
ship that is emerging outward. This beautifully
carved mermaid in the front that is clutching the

01:26:00.604 --> 01:26:08.613
piercing front of the ship. There it rests with a
sign dangling from it, saying The Landlocked Lady.

01:26:08.613 --> 01:26:11.316
MARISHA: I totally get the name of the place now.

01:26:11.316 --> 01:26:13.431
SAM: It's a consistent brand.

01:26:13.431 --> 01:26:14.953
MARISHA: It's very clever.

01:26:14.953 --> 01:26:19.618
LIAM: In Zadash, it would look like shit, but here
it's the belle of the ball.

01:26:19.618 --> 01:26:21.008
MATT: Comparably, yes.

01:26:21.008 --> 01:26:25.142
MARISHA: It seems that they don't have a strong
housing code. They can get away with these more

01:26:25.142 --> 01:26:27.172
unique builds. It's very fascinating.

01:26:27.172 --> 01:26:29.569
SAM: Sure, it's really interesting architecture.

01:26:29.569 --> 01:26:32.154
MATT: It's like Shanghai, China; everything looks
different.

01:26:32.154 --> 01:26:36.432
ASHLY: How far away are the Taskers? Did we just
pass by them?

01:26:36.432 --> 01:26:40.807
MATT: You're skirting around the outside of the
main Tasker tower. They're scattered around, and

01:26:41.219 --> 01:26:46.729
as you guys are walking around, you see most of
the people that live in the city are in absolute

01:26:46.729 --> 01:26:55.269
squalor and are here out of necessity, are here
because they came seeking some sort of fortune and

01:26:55.269 --> 01:27:02.056
failed, or they've come to indulge in vices that
have slowly crushed them. The other half of the

01:27:02.056 --> 01:27:11.792
populace are usually armored to some extent,
whether it be patchwork hides, chain, leathers.

01:27:11.792 --> 01:27:19.836
Almost everyone here is armed, even on a scale of
poverty there seems to be a general sense of

01:27:19.836 --> 01:27:26.099
needing protection amongst the chaos. Some folks
look like they're trying not to be seen, many

01:27:26.099 --> 01:27:32.625
parade their thickened arms. You see one female,
privateer looking individual, that comes through

01:27:32.625 --> 01:27:39.081
the streets and spits on somebody who's huddled by
one of the stumps. Growls at them before

01:27:39.081 --> 01:27:49.927
continuing to walk on. It's a very unique and
curious motley group of people that call this

01:27:49.927 --> 01:27:51.020
place home.

01:27:51.020 --> 01:27:53.596
ASHLY: If I talk to them will I be heard?

01:27:54.143 --> 01:27:55.204
MATT: If you talk to--?

01:27:55.204 --> 01:27:55.744
SAM: Us.

01:27:55.744 --> 01:27:57.413
ASHLY: If I talk to the crew?

01:27:57.413 --> 01:27:59.278
MATT: No one's close enough to you, you think, if
you're quiet enough.

01:27:59.278 --> 01:28:06.638
ASHLY: I point out the Tasker tower behind us and
I say: Those are the Taskers. Those are probably

01:28:06.638 --> 01:28:10.484
the only other people in this shithole that might
be of use.

01:28:10.484 --> 01:28:12.609
SAM: Of use? They're good guys?

01:28:12.609 --> 01:28:18.676
ASHLY: As much as anyone's a good guy here. They
try not to get-- they try to prevent the innocent

01:28:18.957 --> 01:28:23.966
from getting killed or fucked over. Obviously,
they're not particularly successful, but they're

01:28:23.966 --> 01:28:25.876
not under the thumb of any particular group.

01:28:25.876 --> 01:28:28.314
LIAM: Are they altruists though or are they
mercenaries?

01:28:28.314 --> 01:28:34.703
ASHLY: It's altruistic, strangely. I kind of
forgot about them because we always thought they

01:28:34.703 --> 01:28:42.072
were nerds. But now I'm trying to be a little bit
better. They might be helpful.

01:28:42.072 --> 01:28:47.845
SAM: Do they have a uniform, or how do you know
them? How do you know who they are, how can you

01:28:47.845 --> 01:28:48.693
identify them?

01:28:48.693 --> 01:28:54.357
MATT: What you can tell about the Taskers is they
wear chain shirts with one leather shoulder

01:28:54.357 --> 01:28:59.057
pauldron that is painted blue. I say painted blue
because most of their uniform is whatever they can

01:28:59.057 --> 01:29:03.898
put together to create some sort of consistency.
There is no built uniform. What you're used to

01:29:03.898 --> 01:29:10.741
seeing with Crownsguard, and any other royal
military where things are built with fine

01:29:10.741 --> 01:29:16.548
craftsmanship, everything here is put together and
slapdash. That one uniform mark is usually the

01:29:16.548 --> 01:29:21.914
chain shirt and the one blue shoulder armor. Some
people paint it completely, some put a line on it

01:29:21.914 --> 01:29:24.024
and leave it there like a, "Fuck you, I'm not
going to finish it."

01:29:24.024 --> 01:29:27.467
SAM: They're like Hell's Angels.

01:29:27.467 --> 01:29:36.338
MATT: Kind of. For the most part, they're keeping
an eye out in the sense that they don't want

01:29:36.338 --> 01:29:37.969
complete anarchy.

01:29:37.969 --> 01:29:44.618
ASHLY: They still want money for their services,
but they're slightly less assholeish than the most.

01:29:44.618 --> 01:29:46.971
MATT: They're not going to stop someone from
spitting on a peasant, but if all of a sudden a

01:29:47.356 --> 01:29:50.439
giant riot breaks out, they will break it up and
beat everybody up till it stops.

01:29:50.439 --> 01:29:51.172
SAM: Okay.

01:29:51.172 --> 01:29:53.100
MARISHA: It's kind of cool.

01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:57.715
ASHLY: Closest thing to law that exists here.

01:29:57.715 --> 01:30:05.259
SAM: Okay, thank you. (louder) Thank you, horse,
for riding us this far!

01:30:05.259 --> 01:30:10.627
SUMALEE: I can't say anything, right, in my horse
form? I can nod.

01:30:10.627 --> 01:30:15.826
LIAM: (horse huffing)

01:30:15.826 --> 01:30:23.866
MATT: You do keep your mental stats in beast form.
I've seen it argued back and forth, and I'm pretty

01:30:23.866 --> 01:30:27.125
sure when we had you in your elemental form last
campaign, people were saying that you could still

01:30:27.125 --> 01:30:28.637
technically talk in that form.

01:30:28.637 --> 01:30:31.540
MARISHA: Yeah, but I didn't talk as animals. I
wasn't talking.

01:30:31.540 --> 01:30:37.027
MATT: That's right. You're unable to actually
speak in the animal form, but you can still communicate.

01:30:37.027 --> 01:30:42.233
MARISHA: As elementals I was like: Run! Jump! Oh
shit!

01:30:42.233 --> 01:30:45.283
SAM: That's what you are like now.

01:30:45.283 --> 01:30:49.950
(laughter)

01:30:49.950 --> 01:30:52.521
MARISHA: I reverted, that's all.

01:30:52.521 --> 01:31:01.040
LIAM: Keg, if we find an alleyway to drop you out
of sight of you suddenly appearing, can you walk

01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:03.208
around this town, or is that dangerous?

01:31:03.208 --> 01:31:11.159
ASHLY: In some places it's dangerous. There's a
place called The Trench that the Iron Shepherds in

01:31:11.159 --> 01:31:13.398
this area always hang out in.

01:31:13.398 --> 01:31:14.277
SAM: The Trench?

01:31:14.277 --> 01:31:18.799
ASHLY: The Trench. It's in this area. It's not a
huge place, right?

01:31:18.799 --> 01:31:22.484
MATT: It's a fairly decent sized tavern. It's one
of the more populated areas.

01:31:22.484 --> 01:31:24.111
ASHLY: That's where they hang out.

01:31:24.111 --> 01:31:25.266
MATT: Every now and then.

01:31:25.266 --> 01:31:29.431
LIAM: How stupid is it for you to walk up on open
road in this place?

01:31:29.431 --> 01:31:33.178
ASHLY: I think it's probably best for me not to
be.

01:31:33.178 --> 01:31:40.707
SAM: Let's go in the brothel. We're here, right?
We can stay here, or we go in here? Do I have to

01:31:40.707 --> 01:31:42.858
fuck somebody in there?

01:31:42.858 --> 01:31:47.109
ASHLY: Why are you worried about this? They would
be worried about having to fuck you, my man.

01:31:47.109 --> 01:31:48.227
SAM: I'm a lady.

01:31:48.227 --> 01:31:50.531
ASHLY: My lady. I call everyone my man.

01:31:50.531 --> 01:31:56.908
SAM: But yes, you're right. You're right, that's a
fair point.

01:31:56.908 --> 01:32:04.417
ASHLY: If any of the Marduns are there, we might
be able to-- to be honest guys, there's not a lot

01:32:04.417 --> 01:32:10.278
of options, but we might be able to get some help
from them. I don't know for sure. In any case,

01:32:10.278 --> 01:32:19.285
it's a place to regroup. This brothel is not in
the business of spilling everybody's secrets out.

01:32:19.285 --> 01:32:20.169
SAM: Let's go in.

01:32:20.169 --> 01:32:26.016
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, one second, though. Which way from
here are these Iron Chefs located?

01:32:26.016 --> 01:32:31.473
ASHLY: They're north of this, yes, Matt? The Sour
Nest is?

01:32:31.473 --> 01:32:37.345
MATT: The Sour Nest is northeast of where you are
in the city. It's beyond this city, into the

01:32:37.345 --> 01:32:42.666
actual Savalierwood. About maybe two hours'
travel.

01:32:42.666 --> 01:32:44.572
LIAM: Two hours' travel?

01:32:44.572 --> 01:32:46.868
SAM: That's their headquarters, right?

01:32:46.868 --> 01:32:52.955
MATT: Beyond the city. The northern half of the
city is almost entirely within the forest itself.

01:32:52.955 --> 01:32:57.085
LIAM: Okay. In that direction?

01:32:57.085 --> 01:32:57.988
ASHLY: Yeah.

01:32:57.988 --> 01:33:01.930
MARISHA: It's in the walls of the city, or in city
limits?

01:33:01.930 --> 01:33:07.125
MATT: No, The Sour Nest is beyond the city. It's
its own little stronghold that exists separate

01:33:07.125 --> 01:33:08.198
from the city itself.

01:33:08.198 --> 01:33:11.523
LIAM: Can you describe to me what it looks like?
Is it noticeable?

01:33:11.523 --> 01:33:14.858
ASHLY: God? What does it look like?

01:33:14.858 --> 01:33:27.863
MATT: It's noticeable. It's half a mansion, half a
small stronghold. It has gates around it, heavy

01:33:27.863 --> 01:33:30.805
walls that have spears atop them.

01:33:30.805 --> 01:33:34.691
[wheels rolling]

01:33:34.691 --> 01:33:35.730
MATT: Hey, you're in a town.

01:33:35.730 --> 01:33:39.201
SAM: Yeah! The caravan just came by.

01:33:39.201 --> 01:33:50.195
MATT: It's two story, and there's a subterranean
basement floor to it. They do have hired guard

01:33:50.195 --> 01:33:57.856
that keep watch on it while they're away, and
occasionally while they're there. I can eventually

01:33:57.856 --> 01:34:03.474
provide you with a layout, because you would know.
You've been there a number of times.

01:34:03.474 --> 01:34:06.878
[clomping]

01:34:06.878 --> 01:34:09.131
SAM: I love it! It's so good.

01:34:09.131 --> 01:34:12.382
SUMALEE: That's was me expressing my happiness.

01:34:12.382 --> 01:34:15.881
(laughter)

01:34:15.881 --> 01:34:19.446
ASHLY: It's up to you. We can go up there now if
you want.

01:34:19.446 --> 01:34:25.014
LIAM: No, I do not want to go up there now. I was
thinking of maybe sending my cat, but that can

01:34:25.014 --> 01:34:28.298
wait. Let's go into this place.

01:34:28.298 --> 01:34:34.154
MARISHA: Is it safe for me and Keg to hop out
without it looking shifty?

01:34:34.154 --> 01:34:37.249
MATT: There is an alley off to the side that if
you wait for a moment for nobody watching, you

01:34:37.249 --> 01:34:38.458
guys would be able to step out.

01:34:38.458 --> 01:34:39.471
MARISHA: We do that.

01:34:39.471 --> 01:34:42.412
MATT: You have the opportunity to revert, if you
wish.

01:34:42.412 --> 01:34:50.518
SUMALEE: I actually feel safer in my animal form
in this crazy place.

01:34:50.518 --> 01:34:57.040
SAM: You're going to-- (shouting) You're going to
stay in the alley while we go inside?

01:34:57.040 --> 01:34:58.028
SUMALEE: All right.

01:34:58.028 --> 01:35:00.127
MARISHA: I think horses have regular hearing.

01:35:00.127 --> 01:35:01.821
SAM: Nope. They're mostly deaf.

01:35:01.821 --> 01:35:08.460
SUMALEE: I will shift back to my regular self. You
make a good point, but this place is not making

01:35:08.460 --> 01:35:09.459
Nila happy.

01:35:09.459 --> 01:35:17.410
ASHLY: I apologize in advance for all the shit
you're about to see. I open the door.

01:35:17.410 --> 01:35:21.904
MATT: As you guys hitch the horses to one of the
hitching post off to the side, you make your way

01:35:21.904 --> 01:35:25.760
into the brothel. And that's where we're going to
take a break.

01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:31.401
SUMALEE: Phew. Nila's like: Thank god! Let me
regroup!

01:35:31.401 --> 01:35:38.388
MATT: We're going to take a little break here.
We'll be back here in a few minutes, guys. The

01:35:38.388 --> 01:35:46.719
giveaway we have today, we have a Bolivian
rosewood Hero Vault, with Celtic knot. It looks

01:35:46.940 --> 01:35:49.839
pretty awesome. It's magnet-based, and has your
character vault. You can put your minis in it. You

01:35:49.839 --> 01:35:55.350
can put your dice in there. It's awesome. Go on
and head on over to the Critical Role Twitch chat,

01:35:55.350 --> 01:36:03.107
that's twitch.tv/criticalrole during the break and
enter the keyword "revenge." Only enter it once.

01:36:03.107 --> 01:36:05.569
Any more than that and you're disqualified from
the giveaway.

01:36:05.569 --> 01:36:06.555
SAM: Forever.

01:36:06.555 --> 01:36:11.814
MATT: Forever! No, but we'll come back from the
break with a winner here for you guys, and we'll

01:36:11.814 --> 01:36:14.707
see you here in a few minutes.

01:36:14.707 --> 01:51:07.144
[break]

01:51:07.680 --> 01:51:12.067
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome back! First, we
have our winner for the break. The winner is

01:51:12.067 --> 01:51:19.801
Wundur. W-U-N-D-U-R. Wundur, congratulations.
Chandra will whisper you and get your information

01:51:19.801 --> 01:51:29.548
and get that sent out to you. Well done. Getting
us back in. As you guys step through the archway,

01:51:29.548 --> 01:51:35.108
the double doors opening as Keg pushes and leads
you inside. The first thing that hits you is a

01:51:35.108 --> 01:51:41.353
fresh smell of lavender, a vanilla incense that
strikes your senses, stinging your eyes with its

01:51:41.353 --> 01:51:49.114
potency. On the inside, you can see a handful of
round tables of which two patrons are currently

01:51:49.114 --> 01:51:52.098
eating a meal that has been placed before them.

01:51:52.098 --> 01:51:53.772
ASHLY: I really thought you were going to say
something else.

01:51:53.772 --> 01:51:55.680
SAM: Eating a dead body.

01:51:55.680 --> 01:52:02.586
MATT: Possibly, or a live one. You can see candles
that are placed at the center there, these fine

01:52:02.586 --> 01:52:11.035
silks have been placed. It's such a stark shift
from the dreary and generally muck-covered

01:52:11.035 --> 01:52:19.695
exterior of this city, to step into what seems
oppressively luxurious. Though the closer you

01:52:19.695 --> 01:52:24.981
look, everything is frayed at the edges.
Everything seems to have been here for a while or

01:52:24.981 --> 01:52:31.420
seems to have been weathered through travel or
use. The immediate shine begins to fade as you

01:52:31.420 --> 01:52:37.832
begin to see how much of this is probably a fair
amount of work to keep the upkeep of the facade of

01:52:37.832 --> 01:52:47.985
luxury. To the left of you, you can see a carved
window-like bar or a desk and there behind it you

01:52:47.985 --> 01:52:57.863
can see a human man, probably in his late 30s. His
hair, very short, and the male pattern baldness is

01:52:57.863 --> 01:53:02.422
just starting to set in. You can see a bit of the
shine of the back of his head begin to poke

01:53:02.422 --> 01:53:07.505
through. He has a very well kept handlebar
mustache that curves out very wide to each side of

01:53:07.505 --> 01:53:14.998
his face, and a pointed Van Dyke matching beard
point that comes to the bottom. He has a vest over

01:53:14.998 --> 01:53:24.074
a light green billowing shirt that has a wide
collar that curves out to the sides. As you enter

01:53:24.074 --> 01:53:31.278
and take in, he immediately glances over to meet
your gaze and goes, "Why hello everyone, glad you

01:53:31.278 --> 01:53:39.752
"could make it. Welcome! Welcome to the Landlocked
Lady. How could I be of service? Oh, you are a big one!"

01:53:41.262 --> 01:53:42.467
SUMALEE: I am.

01:53:42.467 --> 01:53:44.722
MATT: "Wonderful, are you looking for work?"

01:53:45.533 --> 01:53:47.459
ASHLY: No, she's not.

01:53:47.459 --> 01:53:54.705
MATT: "No worries. Well, you're here for a reason,
I presume. Do tell me what do you seek? We have

01:53:54.705 --> 01:53:59.201
"rooms for rent, companionship to join as well.
What do you seeking?"

01:53:59.201 --> 01:54:01.719
MARISHA: We'll need all of that above and a little
bit more.

01:54:01.719 --> 01:54:03.790
SAM: Well, I mean not the companionship.

01:54:03.790 --> 01:54:05.144
MARISHA: I've had a hard week

01:54:05.144 --> 01:54:05.711
SAM: Oh!

01:54:05.711 --> 01:54:07.242
MARISHA: What were you saying?

01:54:07.242 --> 01:54:10.578
ASHLY: Champ, right?

01:54:10.578 --> 01:54:13.811
MATT: "Yes? Do I know you?"

01:54:13.811 --> 01:54:14.878
SAM: Champ?

01:54:14.878 --> 01:54:17.346
MARISHA: Champ? His name's Champ!

01:54:17.346 --> 01:54:26.136
ASHLY: Maybe? His name's Champ. Told you it was a
shitter! Yeah, you might know me. Hey, are your

01:54:26.136 --> 01:54:28.268
bosses around bosses around by any chance?

01:54:28.268 --> 01:54:29.572
MATT: "My bosses?"

01:54:29.572 --> 01:54:32.883
ASHLY: The people that actually own this place, I
know you like to pretend.

01:54:32.883 --> 01:54:37.533
MATT: "Are you referring to--?"

01:54:37.533 --> 01:54:38.915
ASHLY: The Marduns.

01:54:38.915 --> 01:54:44.838
MATT: "The Marduns are not around here today.
They are at the Estate Sybaritic."

01:54:44.838 --> 01:54:46.164
ASHLY: What?

01:54:46.164 --> 01:54:48.989
MATT: "It's their estate, its where they live."

01:54:48.989 --> 01:54:51.826
MARISHA: Sybaritic?

01:54:51.826 --> 01:54:52.681
LIAM: Sitaritic?

01:54:52.681 --> 01:54:53.451
MATT: Sybaritic.

01:54:53.451 --> 01:54:54.517
ASHLY: Do I know where that is?

01:54:54.517 --> 01:54:56.519
MATT: You've passed by it, you've never been
there.

01:54:56.519 --> 01:54:58.573
ASHLY: Is it an insight to see if he's lying?

01:54:58.573 --> 01:55:00.665
MATT: Yes, you may.

01:55:00.665 --> 01:55:04.143
ASHLY: Fuck! Critical one.

01:55:04.143 --> 01:55:11.094
MATT: He's a shifty motherfucker, and you're not
entirely certain he's telling the truth or not,

01:55:11.094 --> 01:55:19.007
but seems honest enough. "Lord Anselm does pass
through on occasion, but he's not here today. The

01:55:19.007 --> 01:55:23.293
"rest of them I'm sure are busy with their own
business, but if I see any of them, I could ask,

01:55:23.293 --> 01:55:28.225
"see if they're being summoned by-- what is your
name?"

01:55:28.225 --> 01:55:30.109
ASHLY: It's, um--

01:55:30.109 --> 01:55:33.344
SAM: The Mighty Nein?

01:55:33.344 --> 01:55:37.267
ASHLY: I'm trying to come up with a fake name.

01:55:37.267 --> 01:55:38.111
SAM: Oh.

01:55:40.041 --> 01:55:40.671
ASHLY: Rick.

01:55:40.671 --> 01:55:42.097
MARISHA: Nailed it.

01:55:42.097 --> 01:55:45.819
ASHLY: Rick is my name.

01:55:45.819 --> 01:55:47.469
MATT: Make a deception check.

01:55:47.469 --> 01:55:49.173
(laughter)

01:55:49.173 --> 01:55:52.739
ASHLY: Really? You're not going to let that slide?
19!

01:55:52.739 --> 01:55:54.426
SUMALEE: Rick it is!

01:55:54.426 --> 01:55:55.332
MATT: Plus?

01:55:55.332 --> 01:55:56.516
ASHLY: 19, yeah.

01:55:58.626 --> 01:56:05.350
MATT: "Rick? Very well. I'll make a note. If this
is pressing business, you are more than welcome to

01:56:05.350 --> 01:56:12.101
"attempt to summon them at the estate, as I know
not how often they pass through, but in the

01:56:12.101 --> 01:56:15.536
"meantime, you said you wished rooms and company?"

01:56:15.536 --> 01:56:18.034
SAM: Yes, we'll need rooms for sure.

01:56:18.034 --> 01:56:19.477
MATT: "How many?"

01:56:19.477 --> 01:56:25.600
ASHLY: Give us a second there, Champ. I don't
really feel like I want to stay around this guy

01:56:25.863 --> 01:56:29.704
that much longer. Do you guys want to go to this
estate, or do you want to stay here?

01:56:29.704 --> 01:56:31.646
SAM: The estate? What would we do there?

01:56:31.646 --> 01:56:33.062
SUMALEE: I do not like this man.

01:56:33.062 --> 01:56:40.067
ASHLY: Yeah, that makes two of us, Nila. I don't
know; that's where the Marduns are. You were

01:56:40.067 --> 01:56:41.357
looking for them anyway, right?

01:56:41.357 --> 01:56:49.164
SAM: We're looking for one of their family, but we
don't know enough to march up there and say, "Hey,

01:56:49.164 --> 01:56:56.793
"we're looking for your daughter." We don't even
know if it's a daughter, or a niece or something.

01:56:56.793 --> 01:56:57.637
I don't know.

01:56:57.637 --> 01:57:02.159
MATT: All the information that you have from The
Gentleman is that an individual named Ophelia

01:57:02.159 --> 01:57:08.471
Mardun, who is a friend of his, he sent you up to
give her aid with a problem that she's having.

01:57:08.471 --> 01:57:13.608
SAM: We don't know if she's on the outs with her
family, if they're the ones who had her killed or

01:57:13.608 --> 01:57:17.930
kidnapped. We don't know anything. We'd be
marching into a big question mark.

01:57:17.930 --> 01:57:22.642
MARISHA: Maybe we'll get lucky, and the problem
she wants help with is the Iron Shepherds. Two

01:57:22.642 --> 01:57:27.361
birds with one stone, we win. Still going along
with that plan.

01:57:27.361 --> 01:57:30.150
ASHLY: (laughs) The plan has not changed.

01:57:30.150 --> 01:57:31.460
MARISHA: Has not changed.

01:57:31.460 --> 01:57:32.540
ASHLY: It's the same plan.

01:57:32.540 --> 01:57:38.235
MARISHA: The Molly problem was a hiccup. Seems
kind of cold. Anyway.

01:57:38.235 --> 01:57:39.335
ASHLY: You're working on it.

01:57:39.335 --> 01:57:47.315
SUMALEE: I have something I'd like to do now. In
these moments, I have a little bag of treasures

01:57:47.315 --> 01:57:55.993
that I smell. They're little treasures that I
collect along the way of things that are

01:57:55.993 --> 01:58:06.177
significant and meaningful to me. If I smell it,
it tells me what the experience will be like. If

01:58:06.177 --> 01:58:14.929
we leave this man and go to this Ophelia Mardun,
let me see what my smell check does. Okay?

01:58:14.929 --> 01:58:23.205
SAM: It's like telling a fortune, but with
smelling things. All right.

01:58:23.205 --> 01:58:25.999
MARISHA: That's pretty crazy.

01:58:25.999 --> 01:58:28.077
ASHLY: Is she just getting high?

01:58:28.077 --> 01:58:29.469
MARISHA: She might be.

01:58:29.469 --> 01:58:37.192
MATT: Nila pulls up this small pouch with a
leather flap on the front, and pulling it open

01:58:37.192 --> 01:58:45.894
there is, within a moment, a pungent smell that is
a mixture of earthy, almost mossy scents, mixed

01:58:45.894 --> 01:58:55.263
with spice, mixed with rotted vegetation, mixed
with a bad cheese. It's a plethora of smells, and

01:58:55.263 --> 01:59:02.443
they come in waves. She buries her nose into this
for a second and takes a huge (sniffing).

01:59:02.443 --> 01:59:08.562
SUMALEE: Do I know what I sense, or will you tell
me what I sense?

01:59:08.562 --> 01:59:10.294
MATT: Make a wisdom check.

01:59:10.294 --> 01:59:14.217
LIAM: This is what she does in brothels?

01:59:14.217 --> 01:59:17.518
SAM: I don't know if she knows what a brothel is.

01:59:17.518 --> 01:59:19.712
MATT: Add your wisdom modifier.

01:59:19.712 --> 01:59:24.375
SUMALEE: 17. Oh no, wait. 14.

01:59:24.375 --> 01:59:38.496
MATT: The smell comes into you, and amongst the
barrage of various smells, you catch a rosy, sweet

01:59:38.496 --> 01:59:41.464
smell that cuts through the rest.

01:59:41.464 --> 01:59:52.632
SUMALEE: Yes. We should go to see this Ophelia. It
will be a good outcome.

01:59:52.632 --> 02:00:01.049
LIAM: You have had a lot of luck predicting things
with this stink pouch?

02:00:01.049 --> 02:00:06.593
SUMALEE: Oh, yes. It is not stinky, though. You
may smell it, if you wish.

02:00:06.593 --> 02:00:08.367
LIAM: What do I smell?

02:00:08.367 --> 02:00:10.161
MATT: Make a wisdom check.

02:00:10.161 --> 02:00:19.126
LIAM: Oh, that's pretty good. 19.

02:00:19.126 --> 02:00:35.869
MATT: You get a faint whiff of sawdust that
quickly shifts into a very old, molded, after a

02:00:35.869 --> 02:00:37.278
rain leather.

02:00:37.278 --> 02:00:41.985
LIAM: Oh, well, yes, I'm convinced. We should
definitely just march up to the estate.

02:00:41.985 --> 02:00:50.689
ASHLY: Wait, I want a hit! It's not going to go
well.

02:00:50.689 --> 02:00:53.045
SUMALEE: I did not know that this works for
others.

02:00:53.045 --> 02:00:54.980
ASHLY: Oh yeah, it's a nine.

02:00:54.980 --> 02:00:57.405
MATT: As you get close--

02:00:57.405 --> 02:01:00.440
SAM: (fart noise)

02:01:00.440 --> 02:01:07.947
MATT: You don't even get that close to it. You
have a fairly strong sense of smell, and while

02:01:07.947 --> 02:01:15.778
some smells in your experiences of the world have
put you aback, you can't even describe this

02:01:15.778 --> 02:01:22.554
odorous musk that hits your nostrils, causing your
entire face to wrinkle and recoil.

02:01:22.554 --> 02:01:24.945
ASHLY: Never mind, I was wrong! We shouldn't go!

02:01:24.945 --> 02:01:31.268
MATT: At this point, Champ, who has leaned
forward, watching this, goes, "Out of my

02:01:31.268 --> 02:01:35.276
"curiosity, I'm now invested. Might I have a sniff
as well?"

02:01:35.276 --> 02:01:39.760
(laughter)

02:01:39.760 --> 02:01:41.495
SAM: Everyone's sniffing your bag!

02:01:41.495 --> 02:01:50.933
SUMALEE: It is filled with so many wonderful
things. I promise you. Wait a minute. I do not

02:01:50.933 --> 02:01:52.372
want him to smell this.

02:01:52.372 --> 02:01:56.510
SAM: She doesn't want you to smell her bag.

02:01:56.510 --> 02:02:00.461
MATT: "I didn't want a piece of the stink pouch
anyway."

02:02:00.461 --> 02:02:01.491
SUMALEE: I'm sorry.

02:02:01.491 --> 02:02:07.060
SAM: It's something you have to earn. Maybe
tomorrow.

02:02:07.060 --> 02:02:14.245
SUMALEE: Wait, let me smell. Oh, all right. Here.

02:02:14.245 --> 02:02:28.836
MATT: (sniffs) "No, no. Lesson learned." His eyes
start watering. "Would you like a room for the

02:02:28.836 --> 02:02:30.827
"night? What are your preferences?"

02:02:30.827 --> 02:02:37.072
SAM: Maybe we should get a room or two. That way,
if everything goes wrong, if we're indeed going to

02:02:37.072 --> 02:02:40.069
go to this estate, then we could at least have
somewhere to crash.

02:02:40.069 --> 02:02:46.320
MATT: "I must warn you, if it's more to a room and
you require a companion, the group rates are a bit

02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:47.573
"more expensive."

02:02:47.573 --> 02:02:57.574
ASHLY: He means slumber parties. If we all want to
have a nice rest together, just sleeping, it's

02:02:57.574 --> 02:02:58.372
more money.

02:02:58.372 --> 02:03:06.945
SUMALEE: We have that in my clan, too. We all set
up a huge nest of leaves and sleep together.

02:03:06.945 --> 02:03:08.615
MATT: "Are you sure you're not looking for work?"

02:03:08.615 --> 02:03:09.976
SUMALEE: No.

02:03:09.976 --> 02:03:20.978
MARISHA: Maybe we shouldn't stay here. What time
of day is it?

02:03:20.978 --> 02:03:25.041
MATT: At this point, it's almost dusk. You guys
have traveled the better part of your second day

02:03:25.041 --> 02:03:25.739
to even get here.

02:03:25.739 --> 02:03:32.656
LIAM: Well, perhaps we don't want to show up on
these people's doorstep as the sun is going down.

02:03:32.656 --> 02:03:37.910
Why don't we spend a night here? You were looking
for some companionship. You can work on that.

02:03:37.910 --> 02:03:44.667
SAM: We can ask around. Maybe the clientele might
know some things about the Sheps.

02:03:44.667 --> 02:03:47.052
ASHLY: That's not a bad idea.

02:03:47.052 --> 02:03:51.194
LIAM: Sure, we can talk to the clientele. Maybe
you should hang back.

02:03:51.194 --> 02:03:56.423
SAM: I think I fit in in this town, but they might
recognize me.

02:03:56.423 --> 02:03:58.859
LIAM: How do you mean?

02:03:58.859 --> 02:04:05.350
SAM: No, I mean, the Iron Shepherds know my face,
but it seems like there's so many weirdos in this

02:04:05.350 --> 02:04:13.294
town that, I don't know. No one seemed to be
looking at me funny when we walked in. Oh, wait, I

02:04:13.294 --> 02:04:15.552
was dressed as a gnome, that's why. Never mind.

02:04:15.552 --> 02:04:19.754
(laughter)

02:04:19.754 --> 02:04:23.442
MARISHA: To be fair, this isn't The Iron
Shepherds' hideout, we said, right?

02:04:23.442 --> 02:04:26.506
LIAM: Yeah, that's outside of the city, into the
woods.

02:04:26.506 --> 02:04:29.744
MARISHA: Seems like they wouldn't come here. Rival
family.

02:04:29.744 --> 02:04:32.391
ASHLY: Is it safe to say that they keep to
themselves?

02:04:32.391 --> 02:04:40.726
MATT: For the most part, yeah. They only come into
town to occasionally drink and essentially parade

02:04:40.726 --> 02:04:49.051
dominance. Every now and then checking in to
assert their reputation, and if they have to do

02:04:49.051 --> 02:04:55.445
other bits of dirty work. They are slavers by
normal trade, but they do other things for the

02:04:55.445 --> 02:04:57.298
Jagentoths, if need be.

02:04:57.298 --> 02:05:00.487
ASHLY: They wouldn't feel it necessary to tell
anyone else about us?

02:05:00.487 --> 02:05:06.875
MATT: You're not entirely certain. It depends on
if they assume they're being chased, or they feel

02:05:06.875 --> 02:05:11.992
like the demonstration was enough, but you don't
know.

02:05:11.992 --> 02:05:12.855
ASHLY: All right.

02:05:12.855 --> 02:05:17.060
SAM: Spend the night here, then?

02:05:17.060 --> 02:05:22.041
LIAM: Yeah, I think so. We've been traveling all
day. We stay here, we get up. We don't know

02:05:22.339 --> 02:05:30.067
anything about where the Shepherds-- We know
nothing about their stronghold, just what you're

02:05:30.067 --> 02:05:33.559
able to tell us, but that doesn't tell us how many
people are there now, what we are going to be up

02:05:33.559 --> 02:05:40.718
against. We talk to the Marduns tomorrow, figure
out the next step from there.

02:05:40.718 --> 02:05:44.924
MARISHA: Yeah, let's formulate a plan in the
morning. I can't think right now. I'm a little out

02:05:44.924 --> 02:05:45.982
of it.

02:05:45.982 --> 02:05:52.061
ASHLY: All right. Champ, she sleeps alone. No
funny business, all right?

02:05:52.061 --> 02:05:54.791
MATT: "Of course not. I have a business to run."

02:05:54.791 --> 02:05:55.908
SUMALEE: Thank you.

02:05:55.908 --> 02:05:58.819
MARISHA: I'll take a room for myself, please.

02:05:58.819 --> 02:06:04.005
MATT: "All right. For a singular room rate for the
night, that will be one gold, five silver."

02:06:04.005 --> 02:06:08.627
MARISHA: I arrange for companionship and drinks.

02:06:08.627 --> 02:06:12.904
MATT: "Any preference of companion? We have a
spectrum to choose from."

02:06:12.904 --> 02:06:18.793
MARISHA: It feels weird going and picking someone
out. That feels dirty.

02:06:18.793 --> 02:06:20.632
MATT: "Would you prefer it a surprise?"

02:06:20.632 --> 02:06:23.508
MARISHA: Yeah. Just make her hot, please.

02:06:23.508 --> 02:06:29.698
MATT: "Her. That is a preference. Very well." Goes
and writes something down. "Can be done. For a

02:06:29.698 --> 02:06:34.703
"night's companionship, do you wish just for an
evening's stay, or for the night over?"

02:06:34.703 --> 02:06:38.328
MARISHA: No, just an hour, and then I want to be
alone, please.

02:06:38.328 --> 02:06:42.658
MATT: That will be an additional five gold
pieces.

02:06:42.658 --> 02:06:51.661
MARISHA: All right. Then I get really drunk, and I
go to my room for the night. Send up booze.

02:06:51.661 --> 02:06:59.233
MATT: "An additional five silver. Just racking up
the tab, then." The rest of you?

02:06:59.233 --> 02:07:06.296
SAM: We'll have a room by ourselves.

02:07:06.296 --> 02:07:07.446
MATT: "The four of you?"

02:07:07.446 --> 02:07:09.367
SAM: Oh, no, I mean--

02:07:09.367 --> 02:07:13.427
SUMALEE: I don't mind staying with you.

02:07:13.427 --> 02:07:17.134
ASHLY: No, we're fine, just sleeping.

02:07:17.134 --> 02:07:23.019
MATT: "Very well, suit yourself, but I'll be here
for most of the night, if you change your mind."

02:07:23.019 --> 02:07:25.569
ASHLY: Unless-- No judgment if you want to--

02:07:25.569 --> 02:07:28.438
LIAM: No, we have been together a long time, so
we're used to--

02:07:28.438 --> 02:07:31.176
ASHLY: Oh, you're <i>together.</i>

02:07:31.176 --> 02:07:32.025
LIAM: Sure.

02:07:32.025 --> 02:07:33.162
SAM: Not like that.

02:07:33.162 --> 02:07:37.480
ASHLY: Oh. Okay. I was going to say I think you
could do better, but anyway.

02:07:37.480 --> 02:07:42.316
LIAM: I don't know if that was called for at all.

02:07:42.316 --> 02:07:43.558
ASHLY: Sorry.

02:07:43.558 --> 02:07:49.217
SAM: No, you're absolutely right. He is handsome,
and he could do much better than a little

02:07:49.217 --> 02:07:53.724
freakshow like me. He could meet any girl in town
and sweep her off her feet.

02:07:53.724 --> 02:07:56.382
LIAM: Shush. This one and myself will take one
room.

02:07:56.382 --> 02:07:57.874
ASHLY: I'll go with Nila, then.

02:07:57.874 --> 02:08:01.910
MATT: "All right. Two per room, that's two gold
for the group rate, so four gold for the two

02:08:01.910 --> 02:08:03.664
"additional rooms, please."

02:08:03.664 --> 02:08:09.130
LIAM: I will handle the two gold for Nott and
myself.

02:08:09.130 --> 02:08:09.970
ASHLY: I'll do the two gold for us.

02:08:09.970 --> 02:08:12.908
MATT: "All right." He gives a key to each of you
for each room.

02:08:12.908 --> 02:08:16.158
SUMALEE: Thank you. I was going to give it for us,
but next time.

02:08:16.158 --> 02:08:16.836
ASHLY: No problem.

02:08:16.836 --> 02:08:17.622
LIAM: Oh, boy.

02:08:17.622 --> 02:08:21.256
SAM: What? Do you have any gold left?

02:08:21.256 --> 02:08:22.781
LIAM: Sure, I'm good.

02:08:22.781 --> 02:08:31.548
ASHLY: Sorry, Nott. You're a great gal. It's the
occasional tongue-eating, is mostly what I was

02:08:31.548 --> 02:08:32.180
referring to.

02:08:32.180 --> 02:08:35.113
LIAM: You know, maybe quit while you're ahead.
Nott, come on, let's go upstairs.

02:08:35.113 --> 02:08:41.168
MATT: You guys all scatter to your separate
chambers and find yourselves a, as restful as it

02:08:41.168 --> 02:08:51.164
can be given the events recently, night's sleep.
Beau, drunkenly, you have enough consciousness to

02:08:51.164 --> 02:08:52.988
recall eventually a knock at your door.

02:08:57.488 --> 02:09:00.212
MARISHA: Oh. Right. I open the door.

02:09:00.212 --> 02:09:09.258
MATT: Standing there, you see an amber-skinned
elven woman, a little older than you, with very

02:09:09.258 --> 02:09:14.352
bright, almost platinum hair that is pulled up
into a high ponytail that drifts past the

02:09:14.352 --> 02:09:21.108
shoulders, seeming a very sheer negligee.

02:09:22.438 --> 02:09:26.153
MARISHA: Uhh... Hi.

02:09:26.153 --> 02:09:28.003
SAM: Looking up the spell?

02:09:28.003 --> 02:09:33.399
LIAM: No, something else. You're good. Go on, get
it on.

02:09:33.399 --> 02:09:36.098
MARISHA: What's your name?

02:09:36.098 --> 02:09:42.606
MATT: "Vorsah." She pushes you in the room and
closes the door.

02:09:42.606 --> 02:09:43.964
MARISHA: Okay!

02:09:43.964 --> 02:09:44.868
MATT: Cut to black.

02:09:44.868 --> 02:09:47.798
SUMALEE: Nila was going to cover her ears.

02:09:47.798 --> 02:09:51.991
LIAM: You're probably nailing a 250-year-old!

02:09:51.991 --> 02:09:53.625
MARISHA: Hot!

02:09:53.625 --> 02:09:58.616
SAM: Oh, elven aging! Cougar!

02:09:58.616 --> 02:10:00.103
MARISHA: Yeah, exactly!

02:10:00.103 --> 02:10:10.281
MATT: (singing) Here's to you, Mrs. Robinson. The
morning eventually comes, some of you more

02:10:10.281 --> 02:10:17.160
hungover than others, but as you come to and
gather yourselves and wash for the coming day, you

02:10:17.160 --> 02:10:29.203
hear the sounds of almost broken roosters outside.
They call: this horrible, terrible-- It's a harsh

02:10:29.203 --> 02:10:32.390
north this side of Wildemount for these poor
birds.

02:10:32.390 --> 02:10:34.450
LIAM: Welcome to Deadwood!

02:10:34.450 --> 02:10:41.743
MATT: This is very much the Deadwood of the
continent. You can already hear the town coming

02:10:41.743 --> 02:10:48.300
alive outside; the occasional shouts-- you're
unable to make out the words, but the morning has

02:10:48.569 --> 02:10:54.309
definitely kicked in. You gather your things and
make your way down to the bottom floor where Champ

02:10:54.309 --> 02:10:59.267
is not currently there. There's somebody else--
looks to be a younger man, probably in his late

02:10:59.267 --> 02:11:06.331
teens, early 20s. He appears to be half-elven,
with this curly mop of bright-red hair on the top

02:11:06.331 --> 02:11:09.955
and a smile, and he's currently going through a
ledger of some kind.

02:11:09.955 --> 02:11:11.271
ASHLY: Do I recognize him?

02:11:11.271 --> 02:11:12.468
MATT: You do not.

02:11:12.468 --> 02:11:13.828
SAM: His name is Rex.

02:11:13.828 --> 02:11:16.511
SUMALEE: Rick and Rex.

02:11:16.511 --> 02:11:24.660
LIAM: Before going down with Nott and Caleb, I
would say when we get up: We need to talk for a

02:11:24.660 --> 02:11:26.393
minute, okay?

02:11:26.393 --> 02:11:34.502
SAM: Listen, you should just forgive Keg, she
doesn't know that she was being insulting. She's

02:11:34.502 --> 02:11:42.882
rough around the edges-- and she's right, you
could do better than me. Look at this. This is a

02:11:42.882 --> 02:11:44.933
mess. I mean, the teeth.

02:11:44.933 --> 02:11:49.426
LIAM: I don't care about Keg or any of that. I
want to talk about what you and I are doing.

02:11:49.426 --> 02:11:50.599
SAM: All right.

02:11:50.599 --> 02:12:03.946
LIAM: I was this close to running off from that
road when things turned on us. You and I, we are

02:12:03.946 --> 02:12:07.802
going to survive together. That is the main
thing.

02:12:07.802 --> 02:12:09.246
SAM: Why didn't you run?

02:12:09.246 --> 02:12:19.575
LIAM: The dwarf stepped up. (snaps) Changed my
mind like that.

02:12:19.575 --> 02:12:25.981
SAM: Changed your mind because we had extra help,
or--

02:12:25.981 --> 02:12:30.608
LIAM: Whatever she said to him, he left.

02:12:30.608 --> 02:12:34.273
SAM: Oh, the danger was passed.

02:12:34.273 --> 02:12:34.997
LIAM: Yeah.

02:12:34.997 --> 02:12:35.997
SAM: Mm-hmm.

02:12:35.997 --> 02:12:41.996
LIAM: But we have done a lot and you know what I
am about.

02:12:41.996 --> 02:12:44.675
SAM: Of course I do, yes.

02:12:44.675 --> 02:12:50.200
LIAM: So I just want you and I, you and me
especially, to be on the same page because we have

02:12:50.550 --> 02:12:57.771
been for months now, <i>ja</i>? You are my friend, I
want you to be with me, and I want us to live. We

02:12:57.771 --> 02:13:07.464
have done a lot with these people, and if we can
finesse this and do it in a way that does not

02:13:07.464 --> 02:13:18.793
throw our lives in the fire, there is more to be
achieved. We will help you get to where you want

02:13:18.793 --> 02:13:26.355
to get, and myself, together. We will work
together with these people.

02:13:37.295 --> 02:13:45.418
SAM: I know that you want revenge for what that
man did to you, and there's things I want too,

02:13:45.418 --> 02:14:08.767
but... Mollymauk was amazing. Showed me something.
He had this spirit of life that was pretty

02:14:08.767 --> 02:14:19.943
outstanding. You know, he was the moment that we
all traveled together. He came up, and we were all

02:14:19.943 --> 02:14:26.444
talking, and all cagey, and all iffy with each
other when we met all these folks but he said,

02:14:26.444 --> 02:14:32.070
"Hey, want to come see a circus show?" and that
lit the spark, right?

02:14:32.070 --> 02:14:33.974
LIAM: Yes.

02:14:36.254 --> 02:14:45.943
SAM: But before that, it was-- All I'm saying is,
he was a rainbow man who represented life at its

02:14:46.263 --> 02:14:59.505
fullest, and that's what I want. Even more than
what we were going for before. Together, we're

02:14:59.505 --> 02:15:08.131
sort of living life now, aren't we? Before, we
were in the darkness. So I know we have things to

02:15:08.131 --> 02:15:17.188
do, and I want to do them. But the reason I want
to find these people and rescue them is not to use

02:15:17.188 --> 02:15:30.666
them, and it's not because we've invested time in
them, but it's because I love them. We need to

02:15:30.666 --> 02:15:42.160
find them and rescue them because we're a team
now. So if you're just using them or whatever,

02:15:42.160 --> 02:15:55.042
that's fine and I'll support you; but I want to
find them so that we don't go back to the way it

02:15:55.042 --> 02:16:02.379
was, when we were hiding in the shadows and
ducking into alleys to get away from people. We

02:16:02.379 --> 02:16:09.415
were safe, but we weren't really alive, right?
With these people, we're having fun and winning

02:16:09.415 --> 02:16:19.821
contests and killing bad guys and rescuing
children, and it's amazing. I hope you're with me

02:16:19.821 --> 02:16:23.316
on that, and I hope we are on the same page.

02:16:26.786 --> 02:16:27.966
LIAM: I like them.

02:16:30.816 --> 02:16:34.665
SAM: That's a good start. I think they like you.

02:16:34.665 --> 02:16:44.852
LIAM: We are not hiding anymore. Well, not like we
used to. There is a certain amount of risk to what

02:16:44.852 --> 02:16:53.662
we are doing. And what I want is good, for more
people than just me.

02:16:55.592 --> 02:17:05.249
SAM: I know it is, and I want it for you. We've
used a lot of people in the past and I just want

02:17:05.249 --> 02:17:10.751
to make sure we're not using these folks. Are we?

02:17:12.491 --> 02:17:23.240
LIAM: Well, we are about to risk our lives to pull
three people we met four or five weeks ago out of

02:17:23.240 --> 02:17:30.529
the hands of a lot of dangerous people. Seems like
a pretty good offer for them.

02:17:32.959 --> 02:17:34.303
SAM: Okay.

02:17:38.233 --> 02:17:44.882
LIAM: I don't have any family; you're the closest
thing that I have. I have come to rely on you and

02:17:44.882 --> 02:17:49.765
I am grateful for your company.

02:17:53.245 --> 02:17:55.910
SAM: I couldn't do this without you.

02:17:59.260 --> 02:18:07.516
LIAM: Well, let's screw our courage to the
sticking place and get them out of there.

02:18:07.516 --> 02:18:26.876
SAM: Yes. Let's get them home, and let's kill
Lorenzo. I have an idea. I know my last one didn't

02:18:26.876 --> 02:18:33.157
go so well, but listen: we can't fight these
people. I've said it before and I'll say it again,

02:18:33.157 --> 02:18:45.530
but what we can do is exactly what they do. They
go out and pick off people one at a time. Why

02:18:45.530 --> 02:18:53.701
don't we start doing that to them? Follow them,
track them, see where they go home at night, and

02:18:53.701 --> 02:19:01.783
just pick them off one at a time. The weaker ones
first, and by the time Lorenzo knows what's

02:19:01.783 --> 02:19:05.548
happening, he'll be scared out of his mind.

02:19:07.278 --> 02:19:15.814
LIAM: He would get more defensive with time. I
don't know. We don't know enough. I would like to

02:19:15.814 --> 02:19:17.172
find out where he sleeps.

02:19:17.172 --> 02:19:18.658
SAM: Okay.

02:19:18.658 --> 02:19:30.080
LIAM: Head-on, I agree, not a good idea. We will
take a roundabout way. Let's figure out what we're

02:19:30.080 --> 02:19:31.719
talking about first.

02:19:31.719 --> 02:19:36.035
SAM: All right. To breakfast.

02:19:40.065 --> 02:19:41.575
LIAM: I invite her in.

02:19:41.575 --> 02:19:43.982
SAM: I'll nestle in.

02:19:48.392 --> 02:19:59.504
LIAM: I don't even say anything, just a firm hug.
Let's go down.

02:19:59.504 --> 02:20:10.287
MATT: As both Nila and Keg have enjoyed a decent
meal, not as much as you'd expect for the money

02:20:10.798 --> 02:20:13.876
that was paid included for the evening's stay, but
a meal nevertheless.

02:20:13.876 --> 02:20:15.688
MARISHA: Hotel prices. What?

02:20:15.688 --> 02:20:16.622
LIAM: Sex bacon.

02:20:16.622 --> 02:20:19.432
(laughter)

02:20:19.432 --> 02:20:23.755
MATT: Eventually Caleb and Nott make their way
down to join you.

02:20:23.755 --> 02:20:32.543
ASHLY: When Keg sees Nott, she pulls out a piece
of paper and some broken spectacles and says, Nott?

02:20:32.543 --> 02:20:36.218
SAM: What's this? What are you doing?

02:20:36.218 --> 02:20:41.836
ASHLY: I'm sorry I said that you were not good
enough for--

02:20:41.836 --> 02:20:43.437
SAM: Why are you wearing those things?

02:20:43.437 --> 02:20:49.449
ASHLY: I'm trying to apol-- just give me a second!
I'm sorry I said you were not good enough for Caleb--

02:20:49.477 --> 02:20:50.733
SAM: Did someone tell you to do this?

02:20:50.733 --> 02:20:54.746
ASHLY: You're very nice-- I'm trying to be nice,
just give-- this is as painful for me as it is for

02:20:54.746 --> 02:20:55.884
you, just give me five seconds!

02:20:55.884 --> 02:20:56.466
SAM: Sure, sure.

02:20:56.466 --> 02:20:59.020
ASHLY: I'm sorry I was mean.

02:20:59.020 --> 02:21:01.272
SAM: Can we get some hash browns or something?

02:21:01.272 --> 02:21:07.546
ASHLY: You may be kind of weird, but you're also
nice.

02:21:07.546 --> 02:21:09.934
SAM: I don't think there was a verb in that
sentence.

02:21:09.934 --> 02:21:17.294
ASHLY: I am sorry, and when you aren't eating
tongue, you're sort of cute. Love, Keg.

02:21:17.294 --> 02:21:20.315
SAM: Okay, so, a few things.

02:21:20.315 --> 02:21:22.496
ASHLY: Do you have notes?

02:21:22.496 --> 02:21:25.268
SAM: I mean, you don't need to sign it if you're
saying.

02:21:25.268 --> 02:21:29.888
ASHLY: I don't know, I was writing it! I didn't
know if I was going to say it to you or give it to

02:21:29.888 --> 02:21:33.506
you, so I panicked and I-- I'm sorry.

02:21:33.506 --> 02:21:38.583
MARISHA: Beau comes down the stairs, hearing the
end of it, and just goes (applause)

02:21:38.583 --> 02:21:39.836
ASHLY: Thanks, Beau.

02:21:39.836 --> 02:21:45.355
MARISHA: I could learn a few things from you. That
was a good apology. Damn good.

02:21:45.355 --> 02:21:56.914
SAM: Apology accepted. Don't worry about it, I
have a thick skin about this stuff, and I know I

02:21:56.914 --> 02:22:08.191
haven't put my best foot forward with you. We got
off on a wrong foot. To a brighter tomorrow!

02:22:08.191 --> 02:22:11.026
ASHLY: That was much more eloquent than mine was.

02:22:11.026 --> 02:22:13.177
SAM: I just made that up, I didn't even have to
write it down.

02:22:13.177 --> 02:22:14.446
ASHLY: You didn't even have to write it down?!

02:22:14.446 --> 02:22:14.960
SAM: No.

02:22:14.960 --> 02:22:20.465
ASHLY: Fuck, I'm so bad at this. And then she
shoves bacon in her mouth.

02:22:20.465 --> 02:22:25.260
MATT: All right, so what's your plan?

02:22:27.760 --> 02:22:33.038
LIAM: (long sigh) We are going to go and meet
the Marduns.

02:22:33.038 --> 02:22:33.935
SAM: Okay.

02:22:33.935 --> 02:22:36.271
LIAM: We are going to ask for Ophelia Mardun.

02:22:36.271 --> 02:22:43.282
MARISHA: I have a feeling maybe her business has
something to do with the Iron Shepherds as well.

02:22:43.852 --> 02:22:44.495
LIAM: Maybe.

02:22:44.495 --> 02:22:46.222
ASHLY: We can hope.

02:22:46.222 --> 02:22:49.540
MARISHA: Do you know anything about any of the
families here?

02:22:49.540 --> 02:23:03.935
SUMALEE: I do not. Nila would like to gather these
goodberries and, on the way out, give one to each

02:23:03.935 --> 02:23:07.134
of those horrible sounding roosters.

02:23:07.134 --> 02:23:11.356
(laughter)

02:23:11.356 --> 02:23:12.151
MATT: Perfect.

02:23:12.151 --> 02:23:13.612
SUMALEE: They need help.

02:23:13.612 --> 02:23:20.160
MATT: As Nila's out there healing the roosters and
you're leaving, the young, curly red-haired

02:23:20.160 --> 02:23:30.620
half-elven proprietor at the front leans forward
and says, "I'm sorry, I don't mean to intrude, but

02:23:30.620 --> 02:23:38.182
"whatever it is you're after, good luck and I hope
you're on the right track."

02:23:38.182 --> 02:23:41.237
ASHLY: Who the hell are you?

02:23:41.237 --> 02:23:44.077
SAM: That's super weird. He seems like a nice,
normal person here.

02:23:44.077 --> 02:23:45.789
MARISHA: Is it a female?

02:23:45.789 --> 02:23:56.168
MATT: "Sorry, I'm Keelyn. I take the early shift
here--" It's a man. Vibrant green eyes. "But I've

02:23:56.168 --> 02:24:01.176
"overheard you're going to see the Marduns. Just
listen carefully."

02:24:01.176 --> 02:24:03.864
SAM: Listen carefully?

02:24:03.864 --> 02:24:05.117
MATT: Listen carefully.

02:24:05.117 --> 02:24:07.491
SAM: Like while we walk there, we should listen?

02:24:07.491 --> 02:24:09.452
MATT: As you listen and talk with them.

02:24:09.452 --> 02:24:09.964
SAM: Oh.

02:24:09.964 --> 02:24:13.175
LIAM: Oh. Not right now, but when we are-- <i>ja</i>.

02:24:13.175 --> 02:24:17.706
MARISHA: Well, I imagine we should also be
listening carefully right now, as well as then.

02:24:17.706 --> 02:24:19.482
MATT: "That works as well, but--"

02:24:19.482 --> 02:24:22.647
SAM: What's wrong with them? What should we know?

02:24:22.647 --> 02:24:34.278
MATT: "Nothing. They're gracious employers, I enjoy
my time here, but just listen carefully. I'm

02:24:34.550 --> 02:24:37.679
"trying to help, that's all. Good day! Be off, be
off!"

02:24:37.679 --> 02:24:39.181
SAM: No, I know, but why? We haven't paid you--
okay.

02:24:39.181 --> 02:24:40.590
LIAM: It's very enigmatic, but we will-- okay.

02:24:40.590 --> 02:24:46.546
MATT: "Good luck." Takes a little glass of tea and
sips it.

02:24:46.546 --> 02:24:49.280
ASHLY: Can I do an insight check on him to see if
he's sketchy?

02:24:49.280 --> 02:24:51.271
MATT: Yeah, go for it. He's pretty sketchy.

02:24:51.271 --> 02:24:56.440
ASHLY: I mean, yeah, but sketchy in the-- well,
eight. Like is he trying to fuck with us.

02:24:56.440 --> 02:24:57.672
LIAM: Where are your 20s, Ashly, where are your
20s?

02:24:57.672 --> 02:24:59.796
ASHLY: I know, I wasted them all!

02:24:59.796 --> 02:25:05.146
MATT: It's hard to read. He seems forthright
enough, but also guarded. It's hard to tell.

02:25:05.146 --> 02:25:06.427
ASHLY: Okay.

02:25:06.427 --> 02:25:09.701
SAM: How long have you been working for the
Marduns?

02:25:09.701 --> 02:25:13.859
MATT: "Me? About six, seven months."

02:25:13.859 --> 02:25:17.098
SAM: Do you like the work?

02:25:17.098 --> 02:25:19.470
MATT: "I mean, it has its benefits."

02:25:19.470 --> 02:25:22.316
SAM: You mean, like--

02:25:24.806 --> 02:25:25.806
ASHLY: Nott!

02:25:26.836 --> 02:25:30.900
MATT: "Be on your way and good luck." Sips the tea
again.

02:25:30.900 --> 02:25:32.600
MARISHA: That's totally what he means.

02:25:32.600 --> 02:25:35.577
SAM: What are those marks all over your neck?

02:25:35.577 --> 02:25:38.807
MARISHA: Badge of honor.

02:25:38.807 --> 02:25:40.908
SAM: Did you get in a fight last night?

02:25:40.908 --> 02:25:43.319
ASHLY: Nott, for real, man. Context clues.

02:25:43.319 --> 02:25:50.349
MARISHA: I mean, you could say it was a nice
little tussle. It was a nice little square off.

02:25:50.349 --> 02:25:51.099
SAM: Who won?

02:25:51.099 --> 02:25:52.779
MARISHA: I'd say we both won.

02:25:52.779 --> 02:25:53.434
SAM: Simultaneously?

02:25:54.089 --> 02:25:59.809
MARISHA: I definitely won. I won a few times.

02:25:59.809 --> 02:26:03.559
(laughter)

02:26:03.584 --> 02:26:05.512
SAM: Cool, cool, cool.

02:26:05.532 --> 02:26:10.392
(laughter)

02:26:10.392 --> 02:26:13.715
SUMALEE: Nila will offer you another goodberry,
too.

02:26:13.715 --> 02:26:16.619
MARISHA: Ooh! Do they make my hickies go away?

02:26:16.619 --> 02:26:19.132
MATT: They definitely seem to recede a bit.

02:26:19.132 --> 02:26:24.513
MARISHA: Holy shit. This is miracle cream, Nila!
Oh my god!

02:26:24.513 --> 02:26:29.335
MATT: A use for goodberries I've not yet seen in
my years playing D&D!

02:26:29.741 --> 02:26:31.224
MARISHA: You could make a cosmetic line!

02:26:31.224 --> 02:26:43.083
MATT: All right. As you make your way back into
the streets of the city, you begin to make your way

02:26:43.083 --> 02:26:48.833
back into the Clover Plaza. Now, do you know where
you're going?

02:26:48.833 --> 02:26:50.450
ASHLY: Do I know a lot?

02:26:50.980 --> 02:26:54.600
MATT: You've not been to these estates,
specifically because your employers are

02:26:54.600 --> 02:27:00.850
diametrically opposed to the Marduns, but you know
the vague idea of where it is. But you've never

02:27:00.850 --> 02:27:04.854
traveled there. You could probably ask around, if
you'd like. If you were to search for somebody who

02:27:04.854 --> 02:27:07.104
would hopefully be of help.

02:27:07.104 --> 02:27:09.030
ASHLY: Could we have asked that guy?

02:27:09.030 --> 02:27:10.672
MATT: You can go back and ask.

02:27:10.672 --> 02:27:12.241
ASHLY: Should we go back and ask the creepy guy?

02:27:12.241 --> 02:27:15.193
SAM: I mean, he seems to know them. I guess so.

02:27:17.643 --> 02:27:18.876
ASHLY: One more thing!

02:27:18.876 --> 02:27:22.024
SAM: We're going to go back and ask the creepy guy
how to get to the Marduns'.

02:27:22.024 --> 02:27:23.625
ASHLY: Keelyn.

02:27:25.435 --> 02:27:26.581
MATT: "Hi again!"

02:27:26.581 --> 02:27:33.371
ASHLY: Hi. We should have asked this before we
left the first time. Do you know where their

02:27:33.371 --> 02:27:34.146
estate is?

02:27:34.146 --> 02:27:35.963
MATT: "You're looking for them and you don't know
where they are?"

02:27:35.963 --> 02:27:37.287
ASHLY: Yeah, man.

02:27:37.287 --> 02:27:47.161
MATT: "Northwest outskirts of the town limits,
within the forest. Look for the dark red wood exterior."

02:27:47.161 --> 02:27:48.937
ASHLY: Okay.

02:27:48.937 --> 02:27:51.019
MATT: "You'll find it, I trust."

02:27:51.019 --> 02:27:52.270
ASHLY: Why are you helping us?

02:27:52.270 --> 02:27:56.540
MATT: "Because this place is a shithole and decent
people are hard to find."

02:27:56.540 --> 02:27:59.473
LIAM: We'll let you know if we find them. Come
on.

02:27:59.473 --> 02:28:07.959
MATT: All right. You guys head out into the
streets, and now, it's interesting. As you head

02:28:07.959 --> 02:28:13.917
out into the plaza, it's much busier than it was
towards the evening you were here before. You see

02:28:13.917 --> 02:28:22.243
a small regiment of people. Armored, geared up.
Weapons--

02:28:22.243 --> 02:28:23.498
[crowd sound effects]

02:28:23.498 --> 02:28:24.343
MARISHA: How does he do that?

02:28:24.343 --> 02:28:25.041
ASHLY: The timing!

02:28:25.041 --> 02:28:27.679
LIAM: Where does he get such wonderful toys?

02:28:27.679 --> 02:28:41.952
MATT: BattleBards! And Syrinscape! You glance and
see 20 or so of these figures, all in various

02:28:42.281 --> 02:28:48.276
types of armor and weapons. They're in lines,
ramshackle. It resembles something military, but

02:28:48.276 --> 02:28:54.832
by people who aren't trained by military or at
least have any interest in that type of regimented

02:28:54.832 --> 02:29:08.198
standing. You see, at glance, a few Empire
soldiers, three in full armor. Not crownsguard,

02:29:08.198 --> 02:29:11.633
but from the actual military, that are inspecting
up and down the line.

02:29:11.633 --> 02:29:13.940
MARISHA: Is it like a militia that they're
forming?

02:29:13.940 --> 02:29:18.623
MATT: It looks to be. You recognize most of the
folks here to be Grudge Gang.

02:29:18.623 --> 02:29:20.001
ASHLY: Okay.

02:29:22.491 --> 02:29:24.337
MATT: You have a question?

02:29:26.257 --> 02:29:31.741
LIAM: There is a difference between Crownsguard
and Empire soldiers? Is one higher than the other?

02:29:31.741 --> 02:29:38.957
MATT: Well there's the military. The Crownsguard
are essentially the general guardians of every

02:29:38.957 --> 02:29:41.359
township and they do day to day law enforcement.

02:29:41.359 --> 02:29:42.924
MARISHA and SAM: Cops.

02:29:42.924 --> 02:29:49.214
MATT: The actual military soldiers, you saw
gathering on the outskirts of Zadash when the war

02:29:49.214 --> 02:29:57.194
first kicked in, and passed one of the large
armies traveling eastward from up by the western

02:29:57.194 --> 02:29:58.592
side of the Silberquel Ridge.

02:29:58.592 --> 02:30:06.756
LIAM: Yeah, I don't think we've ever discussed
this, but is Caleb's father Crownsguard, or Empire?

02:30:06.756 --> 02:30:11.042
MATT: No. Your father would have been low-level
military.

02:30:11.042 --> 02:30:13.345
LIAM: Which is below both of those?

02:30:13.345 --> 02:30:14.943
MATT: No. It's slightly above Crownsguard.

02:30:14.943 --> 02:30:15.391
LIAM: Okay.

02:30:18.831 --> 02:30:21.056
ASHLY: They're the Grudge Gang that we see?

02:30:21.056 --> 02:30:32.596
MATT: Yes, and watching as you pass by. You get
the sense that it looks like the Empire is hiring

02:30:32.596 --> 02:30:34.255
mercenaries for the war.

02:30:35.865 --> 02:30:36.982
ASHLY: Okay.

02:30:36.982 --> 02:30:43.477
MATT: Coasting around the north side. You tell the
group to make a wide berth outside of the trench.

02:30:43.477 --> 02:30:52.604
Which is on the northern end of the plaza.
Following the directive of Keelyn you start

02:30:52.604 --> 02:30:59.744
weaving toward what's called North Clover. Clover
Street, you've now begun to note is the large

02:31:00.113 --> 02:31:07.263
central street that is the one throughline of the
entire city. It runs all around the treeline of

02:31:07.263 --> 02:31:17.119
the Savalierwood. It's strange and not straight in
places, and it was designed to follow the southern

02:31:17.119 --> 02:31:26.166
border of this forest. The northern side of it,
North Clover is built directly into this forest.

02:31:26.166 --> 02:31:34.799
You know-- Make a history check, actually. Caleb,
you can make a history check too.

02:31:34.799 --> 02:31:35.354
ASHLY: 17.

02:31:35.354 --> 02:31:47.245
MATT: Not bad. That works. You've been at this for
a while. The Savalierwood has been cursed for many

02:31:47.245 --> 02:31:57.748
centuries. The once-green forest now stands a
greyish purple ashen color that it now holds and

02:31:57.748 --> 02:32:08.579
the superstition and mythology around it has
allowed the city of Shadycreek Run to prevent

02:32:08.579 --> 02:32:14.613
Empire encroachment. They built the city into the
space, and every time the Empire has attempted to

02:32:14.613 --> 02:32:21.904
move forward they've pulled back and used it as a
defensive position. Essentially, over a number of

02:32:21.904 --> 02:32:27.882
conflicts, the Empire just gave up, and let the
region exist on its own. It is dangerous, the

02:32:27.882 --> 02:32:31.561
wood. The deeper in, the more dangerous it gets.

02:32:31.561 --> 02:32:34.033
ASHLY: And The Sour Nest is nestled into it.

02:32:34.033 --> 02:32:38.479
MATT: It's nestled into the forest even further
north of where the city stops in the forest.

02:32:38.479 --> 02:32:49.627
Continuing on you begin to enter the canopy of the
south Savalierwood. The shade completely consumes

02:32:49.627 --> 02:32:59.434
the city at this point, even though it's
mid-morning and the clouds are broken up so that

02:32:59.434 --> 02:33:02.288
occasional bits of warmth and sunlight would
occasionally pass through the city, now it seems

02:33:02.288 --> 02:33:11.362
like it's almost dusk immediately. Occasionally
you see a leaf tumble past, and then another. It's

02:33:11.362 --> 02:33:21.017
almost beautiful, the color, but it does have
almost a decaying sense to its meeting between

02:33:21.017 --> 02:33:26.245
grey and purple. It's beautiful in light, and then
when it hits the ground it almost looks like it's

02:33:26.245 --> 02:33:31.878
bereft of life. You don't understand the nature of
this enchantment, whatever this curse may be that

02:33:31.878 --> 02:33:32.605
you've heard of.

02:33:32.605 --> 02:33:40.274
MARISHA: Nila. Is there something wrong with the
soil here or something? Do you know anything about this?

02:33:40.274 --> 02:33:51.607
SUMALEE: I don't like the look of it. Feels bad.
Do I have something that can tell? Do you know?

02:33:51.607 --> 02:33:54.085
(laughter)

02:33:54.085 --> 02:33:56.281
LIAM: Well, you're not familiar with this where
you are from?

02:33:56.281 --> 02:33:57.625
SUMALEE: No, no.

02:33:57.625 --> 02:33:59.776
MARISHA: You could do a general nature check.

02:33:59.776 --> 02:34:01.677
MATT: You could do a nature check if you wanted to
try--

02:34:01.677 --> 02:34:03.998
SUMALEE: I wanted to use Druidcraft, but I don't
know.

02:34:03.998 --> 02:34:05.742
LIAM: Roll one of your buddies.

02:34:09.752 --> 02:34:13.161
SUMALEE: Plus eight.

02:34:13.161 --> 02:34:13.980
LIAM: 14.

02:34:13.980 --> 02:34:16.264
MARISHA: No, no. Eight total.

02:34:16.264 --> 02:34:19.528
SUMALEE: It's right? This roll plus two.

02:34:19.528 --> 02:34:25.224
MATT: Correct, yeah. This is beyond you. In all of
your experience-- and you're very connected with

02:34:25.224 --> 02:34:29.753
the land of the valley-- this far north you've not
encountered something like this. The forest-- the

02:34:29.753 --> 02:34:39.452
best you can tell, the forest still lives. The
nature of where it draws its life and this color

02:34:39.452 --> 02:34:41.867
is very unnatural and it spooks you.

02:34:41.867 --> 02:34:43.589
SUMALEE: Is it like a half-dead forest? Like a--

02:34:43.589 --> 02:34:49.239
MATT: It feels alive and you pick up the leaf that
you saw tumbled before you and you feel it and it

02:34:49.239 --> 02:34:56.806
still brims with health. It also off-puts you. You
get chills and you don't know why.

02:34:56.806 --> 02:35:02.103
SUMALEE: I don't need to check my smell bag for
this.

02:35:05.583 --> 02:35:06.655
MARISHA: All right.

02:35:06.655 --> 02:35:08.563
MATT: I think stink pouch is still my favorite
phrase.

02:35:08.563 --> 02:35:11.063
SUMALEE: Stink pouch, fine.

02:35:11.063 --> 02:35:13.259
MATT: No, smell bag is great.

02:35:13.259 --> 02:35:14.778
SAM: Odor sack?

02:35:14.778 --> 02:35:19.474
ASHLY: It's somehow worse than stink pouch as far
as what it evokes.

02:35:19.474 --> 02:35:20.525
LIAM: Sniff nuts.

02:35:20.525 --> 02:35:24.714
SUMALEE: Are there any animals?

02:35:24.714 --> 02:35:27.904
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:35:27.904 --> 02:35:31.473
MARISHA: What was the name of the forest?

02:35:31.473 --> 02:35:33.853
SUMALEE: Ooh, it hit that, does that count? Can I
roll again?

02:35:33.853 --> 02:35:35.894
MATT: It still counts, yeah, unfortunately.

02:35:35.894 --> 02:35:36.763
SUMALEE: Eight.

02:35:36.763 --> 02:35:44.849
MATT: You don't see anything specifically. You do
hear birds, so it isn't bereft of wildlife. At

02:35:44.849 --> 02:35:50.959
least you get the sense that there is at least a
symbiotic relationship with some wildlife in the

02:35:50.959 --> 02:35:52.739
bit of the forest you've been in.

02:35:52.739 --> 02:35:58.842
SUMALEE: I'd love to take one of my goodberries to
draw one of the birds and see if I might talk with

02:35:59.267 --> 02:36:02.549
it and see if it could tell us anything about
before.

02:36:02.549 --> 02:36:04.265
MATT: Make an animal handling check.

02:36:04.265 --> 02:36:07.136
SAM: Ooh, what is this? Druid stuff.

02:36:07.136 --> 02:36:11.008
SUMALEE: 12 plus seven. 19.

02:36:11.008 --> 02:36:19.426
MATT: As you hold the goodberry out, which, with
your arm length, is a good nine, nine and a half

02:36:19.426 --> 02:36:26.838
feet up towards the lower hanging branches, and
you (bird song) give a little counterwhistle to

02:36:26.838 --> 02:36:32.809
the sound of one of the birds you hear. You hear a
retort (bird whistle) and you return it (bird

02:36:32.809 --> 02:36:39.977
whistle), and then it returns (bird whistle,
flutter), and then down onto the edge of your hand

02:36:39.977 --> 02:36:46.211
you see this tiny little blackbird with a white
stripe that goes down the edge of each wing. It--

02:36:46.211 --> 02:36:51.030
(chirping)-- and starts eating the goodberry,
messing the edge of its beak.

02:36:51.030 --> 02:36:52.127
LIAM: -- giant shitty rooster.

02:36:52.127 --> 02:36:54.312
ASHLY: (squawk)

02:36:55.862 --> 02:37:00.836
MATT: It's eating the goodberry. What would you
like to do?

02:37:00.836 --> 02:37:06.330
SUMALEE: What would we like to ask it?

02:37:06.330 --> 02:37:13.044
SAM: First thing that pops into my mind is do you
know Kiri, but I don't think that's relevant.

02:37:13.044 --> 02:37:16.532
MARISHA: You have to stop thinking that all people
who look like each other know everybody.

02:37:16.532 --> 02:37:17.530
SAM: Don't they though?

02:37:17.530 --> 02:37:18.025
MARISHA: No!

02:37:18.025 --> 02:37:24.154
SAM: All right. Maybe, "How long has this curse
been here? How long has the forest been

02:37:24.154 --> 02:37:25.600
"spooky-ooky?"

02:37:25.600 --> 02:37:29.175
MARISHA: Do they know how much further the
Marduns' keep is?

02:37:29.175 --> 02:37:30.851
SAM: Are there any monsters out there?

02:37:30.851 --> 02:37:37.956
SUMALEE: That's too much, one at a time! How long
has the forest been like this?

02:37:37.956 --> 02:37:41.159
MATT: Are you using a spell or are you using your
firbolg ability?

02:37:41.159 --> 02:37:43.333
SUMALEE: Oh, I'm using my firbolg ability.

02:37:43.333 --> 02:37:45.408
MATT: That allows you to speak to animals.

02:37:45.408 --> 02:37:51.444
SUMALEE: Oh yes, I have to use a spell. Sorry.
Wait, which one is it?

02:37:51.444 --> 02:37:53.352
LIAM and SAM: Wait.

02:37:53.352 --> 02:37:55.831
SUMALEE: Do you know which one it is?

02:37:55.831 --> 02:37:58.181
MARISHA and LIAM: Speak with Animals.

02:37:58.181 --> 02:37:59.430
SUMALEE: Speech of the woods!

02:37:59.430 --> 02:38:00.518
ASHLY: Nila's just staring at this bird.

02:38:00.518 --> 02:38:03.106
MATT: Speech of the woods is your firbolg
ability.

02:38:03.106 --> 02:38:04.354
SUMALEE: Oh. I know I have it.

02:38:04.354 --> 02:38:10.651
MATT: If you look on your spell list, the cards
you have prepared, do you have Speak with Animals prepared?

02:38:10.853 --> 02:38:17.380
SUMALEE: I know I have it. Oh, it's because I
chose my Spirit Totem.

02:38:17.380 --> 02:38:19.602
MATT: Oh right. Because you're Shepherd.

02:38:19.602 --> 02:38:20.809
SUMALEE: Yes. I have--

02:38:20.809 --> 02:38:23.393
MATT: Yes you do, because you're Circle of the
Shepherd.

02:38:23.393 --> 02:38:23.986
SUMALEE: Whew!

02:38:23.986 --> 02:38:26.550
MARISHA: You got this!

02:38:26.550 --> 02:38:30.352
SUMALEE: I was like, "I set this all up and then
I'm not going to be able to talk to the bird!"

02:38:30.352 --> 02:38:33.332
LIAM: She's an Iron Shepherd, kill her!

02:38:33.332 --> 02:38:41.986
MATT: You get to mark off one of your 1st-level
spells. As you ask the bird, the bird returns--

02:38:41.986 --> 02:38:47.367
and you guys hear her whistle to the bird, and the
bird whistles back quite a bit, this beautiful

02:38:47.367 --> 02:38:57.362
song that plays. The bird conveys to you, "Far,
far before my time."

02:39:00.382 --> 02:39:02.799
SUMALEE: It says it's been this way a long time.

02:39:02.799 --> 02:39:07.639
MARISHA: Wow. I mean, how long is long for a bird
though?

02:39:07.639 --> 02:39:12.697
SAM: They only live for three weeks, right? That's
probably a bad question.

02:39:12.697 --> 02:39:18.868
SUMALEE: This bird lives a long time, I can tell
you. This type of bird is not a short-lived bird.

02:39:19.173 --> 02:39:22.589
MARISHA: Dagon can live to be 30. She's going to
outlive us all.

02:39:22.589 --> 02:39:26.688
LIAM: Would you like to ask it what is dangerous
in the wood?

02:39:26.688 --> 02:39:32.633
SUMALEE: Yes. What is most dangerous here?

02:39:32.633 --> 02:39:34.755
MATT: "Be wary of spirits."

02:39:34.755 --> 02:39:36.996
MARISHA: Ooh, spirits.

02:39:36.996 --> 02:39:40.079
MATT: "Be wary of bone-spurred beasts."

02:39:40.079 --> 02:39:43.550
MARISHA: Bone-spurred beasts. Okay.

02:39:43.550 --> 02:39:48.238
ASHLY: Doesn't sound great.

02:39:48.238 --> 02:39:55.529
SUMALEE: What other questions? Are you still
willing to answer some more?

02:39:55.529 --> 02:39:57.322
MATT: How long does the spell last?

02:39:57.322 --> 02:40:00.703
LIAM: Three days.

02:40:00.703 --> 02:40:03.572
ASHLY: The bird's a party member now.

02:40:03.572 --> 02:40:07.041
MATT: It lasts for ten minutes.

02:40:07.041 --> 02:40:07.973
MARISHA: Ooh, yeah.

02:40:07.973 --> 02:40:12.688
SAM: How far are we from the Mardun house? I don't
know if the bird is going to know--

02:40:12.688 --> 02:40:14.520
SUMALEE: I don't think the the bird would know the
Mardun house.

02:40:14.520 --> 02:40:16.340
SAM: Well, we can describe it: red wood house.

02:40:16.340 --> 02:40:17.248
MARISHA: Mansion!

02:40:17.248 --> 02:40:18.553
SAM: Red wood mansion.

02:40:18.553 --> 02:40:19.581
SUMALEE: Oh, all right.

02:40:19.581 --> 02:40:20.781
MARISHA: Northwestish.

02:40:20.781 --> 02:40:29.587
SUMALEE: I'd like to send the bird, mentally, the
picture of what that bird's eye view would be and

02:40:29.587 --> 02:40:31.386
to see if the bird has seen that.

02:40:31.386 --> 02:40:43.256
MATT: Okay, you focus and express mentally and
through small verbal gestures towards it the idea

02:40:43.256 --> 02:40:47.580
of this color and this shape. Immediately the bird
(flapping) takes off.

02:40:47.580 --> 02:40:52.257
MARISHA and SAM: (gasp) Follow the bird.

02:40:52.257 --> 02:40:56.631
MATT: You guys all start keeping up and jogging
behind it. You watch as it goes (flapping) and it

02:40:56.631 --> 02:41:01.697
lands on a post, lands on a little roof, looks
back at you, (whistling) (flapping) and it's

02:41:01.697 --> 02:41:06.580
waiting and showing you a path through these
streets. In doing so, you're dodging past--

02:41:06.580 --> 02:41:15.401
originally when you walked in there were broken
down tent cities and hovels and not a good space.

02:41:15.401 --> 02:41:21.194
Here the road and alleys break down. It's more
sparse. The buildings are further apart. It's less

02:41:21.194 --> 02:41:27.831
of like a gridded city and more of a cluster of
buildings that are generally more well made, and

02:41:27.831 --> 02:41:32.555
you get the sense that this is the wealthier area.
You in your experience know that the North Clover

02:41:32.555 --> 02:41:40.202
is where most of the tribes, the different ruling
families, exist and claim their territory. You

02:41:40.202 --> 02:41:48.296
move past a couple of buildings, eventually the
bird bringing you to a beautiful, two-story estate

02:41:48.296 --> 02:41:54.234
that's in the beginning stages of showing
disrepair. The dark-red wood appears imported, and

02:41:54.234 --> 02:42:01.534
the tall stone fence that encircles the building
is topped with six-inch spear tips. A few that

02:42:01.534 --> 02:42:06.910
look bent and off kilter, but still dangerous
enough for somebody who wished to try and leap the

02:42:06.910 --> 02:42:14.336
six, seven-foot fence. The courtyard houses a once
beautiful garden that now turns grey with the

02:42:14.336 --> 02:42:21.260
winter. You can see rose bushes that have since
browned and withered but the roses still slowly

02:42:21.260 --> 02:42:27.725
left there to dry and lose color. You can see in
the center of this courtyard a small fountain of

02:42:27.725 --> 02:42:34.245
some kind, but now it's filled with slushed snow,
and here the bits of the snow that have been

02:42:34.245 --> 02:42:40.771
pushed off the streets, give way to this estate
that's glaring now at the outskirts of the forest.

02:42:40.771 --> 02:42:45.474
You can see beyond it, it's just wood. This
definitely marks, at least at this part of

02:42:45.918 --> 02:42:52.994
Shadycreek Run, the end of the city, before you
begin to crest into the Savalierwood itself. There

02:42:52.994 --> 02:43:02.875
are three individuals that are wearing simple
chain mail, that are walking inside the courtyard.

02:43:02.875 --> 02:43:10.669
One has a crossbow at their side, the other has a
shortbow across their shoulder. One is sitting,

02:43:10.669 --> 02:43:17.119
looking out. The other looks like they're eating
some sort of dried meat from a pouch, and they

02:43:17.119 --> 02:43:20.491
glance over and watch as you approach and keep an
eye.

02:43:20.491 --> 02:43:23.140
MARISHA: Do they look like Taskers? Do they have
the same armor?

02:43:23.140 --> 02:43:24.191
MATT: They're not Taskers, no.

02:43:24.191 --> 02:43:25.021
MARISHA: Okay.

02:43:25.021 --> 02:43:28.969
SAM: They're probably just guarding the place.

02:43:28.969 --> 02:43:29.730
MARISHA: Hired hands.

02:43:29.730 --> 02:43:31.994
SAM: Does someone want to go talk to them?

02:43:31.994 --> 02:43:37.436
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i> That is not a problem. Hello.

02:43:37.436 --> 02:43:46.688
MATT: The one that's sitting, stands up and puts
his crossbow like-- ready, not pointing it at you, but--

02:43:46.688 --> 02:43:49.250
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i> We are good here.

02:43:49.250 --> 02:43:51.462
MATT: "What is your intent here?"

02:43:51.462 --> 02:43:58.714
LIAM: We have been traveling a great distance. We
are here to speak, if you don't mind, we have a

02:43:58.714 --> 02:44:06.848
message for Ophelia Mardun. It can only be heard
by her. We have been charged with this message and

02:44:06.848 --> 02:44:12.472
no funny business. I hope that we could impart our
message and be done.

02:44:12.472 --> 02:44:14.677
MATT: "I can take your message and pass it on!"

02:44:14.677 --> 02:44:26.918
LIAM: Would you tell her that a very refined
gentleman from the south would like to pass his

02:44:26.918 --> 02:44:27.937
regards to her.

02:44:27.937 --> 02:44:29.466
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

02:44:29.466 --> 02:44:33.564
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i> (groans)

02:44:33.564 --> 02:44:35.448
SAM: (southern accent) A southern gentleman.

02:44:35.448 --> 02:44:37.435
LIAM: Not very good at all.

02:44:37.435 --> 02:44:41.134
SAM and ASHLY: (groan)

02:44:41.134 --> 02:44:45.905
MATT: He goes, "And there's five of you?"

02:44:45.905 --> 02:44:48.319
LIAM: It is a long way.

02:44:48.319 --> 02:44:50.525
MARISHA: And an important message.

02:44:50.525 --> 02:44:53.800
LIAM: Yeah. Only a fool travels alone.

02:44:53.800 --> 02:45:01.290
MATT: "I'll pass on the message! You'll be
summoned if necessary, but (clicks tongue)" Gives

02:45:01.702 --> 02:45:06.726
a motion over to the other guard who's finished
eating, who's also pulled the shortbow off the

02:45:06.726 --> 02:45:15.971
shoulder and has knocked an arrow into it. Gives a
whistle and the doors to the estate open, and you

02:45:15.971 --> 02:45:23.306
watch as three more guards emerge with crossbows,
and one with a heavy crossbow at the ready. They

02:45:23.306 --> 02:45:30.008
all keep them at the ready, very close eye. One of
them begins to patrol the outside of the building.

02:45:30.008 --> 02:45:37.521
You get the sense immediately that there's a
general anxiety and tension at this space when

02:45:37.521 --> 02:45:42.293
strangers approach. They're being very careful.

02:45:42.293 --> 02:45:50.120
MARISHA: Can I look around, do I see anybody who's
hidden, watching from windows up above, anything

02:45:50.120 --> 02:45:51.722
that looks like we're being watched?

02:45:51.722 --> 02:45:52.980
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:45:52.980 --> 02:45:59.632
MARISHA: Not by guards, necessarily. 21.

02:45:59.632 --> 02:46:08.388
MATT: You glance up, and on the second floor there
is two sets of double windows. They're paned, one

02:46:08.388 --> 02:46:12.570
of them looks to be partially opened, and you can
see on the inside there are curtains. One, the

02:46:12.570 --> 02:46:17.787
curtains are closed, the other is drawn to a side,
and you see a figure looking out below. As soon as

02:46:17.787 --> 02:46:20.899
you look up and see it, the curtain closes.

02:46:20.899 --> 02:46:23.793
MARISHA: Did I catch a glimpse of what the figure
looks like?

02:46:23.793 --> 02:46:31.971
MATT: The figure looked to be human, though the
skin was dark. That's as best as you can get

02:46:31.971 --> 02:46:33.691
before they vanished.

02:46:33.691 --> 02:46:35.054
MARISHA: Okay.

02:46:35.054 --> 02:46:37.888
LIAM: I'm just smiling at the guards.

02:46:37.888 --> 02:46:42.631
MATT: You see all the other guards each place one
of their weapons pointed directly at each of you,

02:46:42.631 --> 02:46:52.622
and the quiet comes over all of you, as this
moment, this standoff continues for a minute, two

02:46:52.622 --> 02:46:57.641
minutes. As the first guard that you spoke to
enters and closes the door behind.

02:46:57.641 --> 02:47:00.843
LIAM: (exhales)

02:47:00.843 --> 02:47:06.709
ASHLY: So do you like being guards?

02:47:06.709 --> 02:47:09.118
MATT: "Shh!" One of them tightens the grip.

02:47:09.118 --> 02:47:10.397
ASHLY: Got it.

02:47:10.397 --> 02:47:17.453
MATT: This large, heavy crossbow already notched
backward and the tension on the wire itself is--

02:47:17.453 --> 02:47:20.882
this guy is looking like he is ready to fire.

02:47:20.882 --> 02:47:26.214
LIAM: We are all going to laugh about this later,
I promise. (nervous laugh)

02:47:26.214 --> 02:47:30.460
MATT: A moment later the guard emerges from the
door. "All right, stand down."

02:47:30.460 --> 02:47:32.533
SAM: Oh.

02:47:32.533 --> 02:47:36.211
MATT: They all pull their weapons away, looking
disappointed.

02:47:36.211 --> 02:47:38.744
LIAM: We are good?

02:47:38.744 --> 02:47:45.484
MATT: "Open the gate." The guard who was eating
earlier, puts the shortbow over the shoulder,

02:47:45.484 --> 02:47:49.204
still looking wary, and they're not moving from
where they're standing. They're all keeping a very

02:47:49.204 --> 02:47:55.292
close eye on all five of you. Opens the gate
(clicking) (creaking). The metallic gate swings

02:47:55.292 --> 02:48:00.559
open, and you're all brought into the courtyard.
As you're begin to follow the first guard you

02:48:00.559 --> 02:48:07.374
spoke with, they all slowly coalesce behind you,
still keeping their weapons at the side, but ready

02:48:07.374 --> 02:48:17.311
if need be. As you're led to the interior chamber
of this estate, the Estate Sybaritic. As soon as

02:48:17.311 --> 02:48:26.054
you enter the main foyer, the earthy smell of the
forest gives way to the lingering scent of a

02:48:26.054 --> 02:48:33.832
recent meal. As if the cooked meats and starches
that were eaten maybe an hour or two beforehand

02:48:33.832 --> 02:48:40.291
still permeate the air of this entryway. You see
before you a staircase that continues upward, red

02:48:40.291 --> 02:48:45.431
carpeted, before switching back to a second floor.
In that center landing you can see a very open

02:48:45.431 --> 02:48:52.042
window that looks down to possibly a backyard of
some kind, but currently the view is of the

02:48:52.042 --> 02:48:56.053
darkened leaves and bits of sunlight that break
through. It seems like something that was built

02:48:56.053 --> 02:49:01.856
for a beautiful view, not understanding until it
was completed that it didn't really catch much of

02:49:01.856 --> 02:49:08.458
a view amongst this forest, like the original
builder had brought sensibilities from outside to

02:49:08.458 --> 02:49:14.819
bring them in, and it was not compatible with this
landscape. There, you see to the left and right of

02:49:14.819 --> 02:49:26.888
you art pieces that depict people. You can see
individuals of different backgrounds, and you see

02:49:26.888 --> 02:49:34.722
one that appears to be of pure elven blood with
brown hair, difficult to make out the gender, but

02:49:34.722 --> 02:49:45.792
beautiful and standing very robust with a chin out
and a wily grin. Oils, very well done. To the left

02:49:45.792 --> 02:49:52.461
of you, you can see the other portrait appears to
be a woman with a very well made dress with these

02:49:52.461 --> 02:50:01.617
large, almost puffs at the shoulders. It seems
almost trying too hard to be aristocratic.

02:50:01.617 --> 02:50:09.312
It's garish, but here you are. A moment
later the door closes behind you, and you're still

02:50:09.535 --> 02:50:19.411
being flanked by this bevy of guards. You hear the
heavy footsteps coming down the staircase. Turning

02:50:19.411 --> 02:50:23.953
the corner, you see a figure now, framed in what
little of the light is coming through that window

02:50:23.953 --> 02:50:37.062
behind them. (footfalls) Stepping down you see a
woman, dark-gray skin and ankle-length, black hair

02:50:37.062 --> 02:50:47.982
that is smooth and straight that falls behind her.
You see bony crests of horns that curve up into

02:50:47.982 --> 02:50:57.589
these two large points behind the head and bright
yellow eyes that are pupil-less. A grin that shows

02:50:57.589 --> 02:51:08.228
two fanged canines. As she descends you can see
her attire is very formal, colonial style coat

02:51:08.228 --> 02:51:16.441
with epaulets, but it seems to be tailored to not
hide her figure. She already exudes an air of

02:51:16.441 --> 02:51:26.150
powerful aggression and presence. With each step
that she takes down there, you can sense her

02:51:26.150 --> 02:51:33.649
immediately reading and seeing in and through each
of you. Quietly she takes the last step to the

02:51:33.649 --> 02:51:44.151
landing here in the foyer. (German accent) "You
bring tidings from The Gentleman, you say."

02:51:44.151 --> 02:51:49.567
LIAM: That is correct, <i>ja.</i>

02:51:49.567 --> 02:51:55.359
MATT: "Well you have invoked the name of my
comrade. You have my attention, do not squander

02:51:55.359 --> 02:51:58.321
"it. Why are you here?"

02:51:58.321 --> 02:52:04.650
LIAM: Well, we will be plain. He has sent us. He
has told us that you are in need of assistance,

02:52:04.650 --> 02:52:08.081
and he has deemed us worthy to provide it.

02:52:08.081 --> 02:52:10.044
SAM: Are you Ophelia?

02:52:10.044 --> 02:52:11.503
MATT: "I am."

02:52:11.503 --> 02:52:12.757
SAM: Oh, just making sure.

02:52:12.757 --> 02:52:14.016
MARISHA: Yeah, that's good.

02:52:14.016 --> 02:52:16.914
SAM: It could be someone else.

02:52:16.914 --> 02:52:22.980
MATT: "Thorough, I appreciate that. Well so, you
are the help that he sent. Timely, three days

02:52:22.980 --> 02:52:30.301
"earlier would have been better, but here we are. I
shall not fret on it. Thank you for coming. Be at

02:52:30.301 --> 02:52:36.904
"ease, go watch the back walls, make sure nobody
tries to sneak in while we're talking." The guards

02:52:36.904 --> 02:52:43.671
all scatter, except for two who stay posted at
each side of the door behind you. "How much have

02:52:43.671 --> 02:52:46.787
"you been told?"

02:52:46.787 --> 02:52:49.668
LIAM: (small laugh) Not very much.

02:52:49.668 --> 02:52:56.378
MATT: You watch as her eyes looks you from head to
toe and her tongue runs across her lip a bit.

02:52:56.378 --> 02:53:05.062
"(sighs) I've had an open line of shipments to
Zadash, through our mutual friend for some time,

02:53:05.062 --> 02:53:08.063
"made a beneficial arrangement for many years."

02:53:08.063 --> 02:53:11.821
MARISHA: Can I do an insight check? Did it look
like she cast a spell just then?

02:53:11.821 --> 02:53:19.174
MATT: Sure, make an insight check.

02:53:19.174 --> 02:53:22.653
MARISHA: 25.

02:53:22.653 --> 02:53:24.492
SAM: Oh, whispers.

02:53:24.492 --> 02:53:25.428
SAM and ASHLY: Whispers.

02:53:25.428 --> 02:53:26.441
LIAM: Fireball.

02:53:26.441 --> 02:53:28.567
(laughter)

02:53:28.567 --> 02:53:30.651
SAM: Guys--

02:53:30.651 --> 02:53:32.507
LIAM and SAM: D&D Beyond.

02:53:32.507 --> 02:53:33.296
LIAM: Am I right?

02:53:33.296 --> 02:53:33.992
SAM: Is a really good app.

02:53:33.992 --> 02:53:35.113
ASHLY: (flatly) It's so great.

02:53:35.113 --> 02:53:37.502
LIAM: It's like-- I can be on the shitter, if I
want to check--

02:53:37.502 --> 02:53:38.393
SAM: You can customize that.

02:53:38.393 --> 02:53:39.193
LIAM: Caleb's spells.

02:53:39.193 --> 02:53:39.819
ASHLY: I can?!

02:53:39.819 --> 02:53:41.132
MATT: Oh god.

02:53:41.132 --> 02:53:42.504
SAM: You can with their new upgrade.

02:53:42.504 --> 02:53:43.452
LIAM: I can be mid dook.

02:53:43.452 --> 02:53:44.924
SAM: You can be mid dook?

02:53:44.924 --> 02:53:46.549
LIAM: Mid dook and check my spells.

02:53:46.549 --> 02:53:48.252
SAM: You're mid dook right now.

02:53:48.252 --> 02:53:49.982
MATT: Anyway, bringing it back in.

02:53:49.982 --> 02:53:51.930
MARISHA: Shipments to Zadash.

02:53:51.930 --> 02:53:59.899
MATT: "However, my most trusted team of smugglers
that handle that route and knew it well were slain

02:53:59.899 --> 02:54:02.739
"a little over a month ago."

02:54:02.739 --> 02:54:05.310
SAM: Do you know by whom?

02:54:05.310 --> 02:54:09.810
MATT: "Well, at first we thought it was maybe the
dire beasts of the wood around us, but our

02:54:09.810 --> 02:54:21.391
"internal priest was able to divine the source of
their demise. In other words, at the hands of the Jagentoths."

02:54:21.391 --> 02:54:22.989
SAM: The who? What?

02:54:22.989 --> 02:54:24.672
ASHLY: It's the family that controls the Iron
Shepherds.

02:54:24.672 --> 02:54:26.433
SAM: The Jagendoths?

02:54:26.433 --> 02:54:27.590
ASHLY: The Jagentoths.

02:54:27.590 --> 02:54:39.652
MATT: "Now we've-- as you seem to know this well."
She looks over you. "You look familiar. What is

02:54:39.652 --> 02:54:41.580
"your name?"

02:54:41.580 --> 02:54:43.069
ASHLY: Keg.

02:54:43.069 --> 02:54:48.002
MATT: "Keg, I know that name."

02:54:48.002 --> 02:54:55.488
ASHLY: I used to work for them. Not anymore.

02:54:55.488 --> 02:55:02.903
MATT: At which point you hear the guards behind
(cocking crossbow). The crossbows go back up into

02:55:02.903 --> 02:55:08.704
position. You glance over your shoulder to see
them both pointed-- "What assurances can I have

02:55:08.704 --> 02:55:13.970
"that I not need strike you down where you stand?"

02:55:13.970 --> 02:55:19.807
ASHLY: You don't have any, but I have a lot of
information about them.

02:55:19.807 --> 02:55:22.667
SAM: We just killed one of them.

02:55:22.667 --> 02:55:25.638
ASHLY: Oh, that's true. That's better. We killed
one of them.

02:55:25.638 --> 02:55:29.022
MATT: Make a persuasion check with advantage.

02:55:31.824 --> 02:55:35.818
ASHLY: That is a 12.

02:55:35.818 --> 02:55:50.912
MATT: "Intriguing. Very well." They go down.
"(sighing) We and these Jagentoths have feuded for

02:55:50.912 --> 02:55:59.061
"quite some time between these tribes. Many times
it has come to bloodshed, but now with the Grudge

wise to send you, and this kindness shall be

We here of the Estate Sybaritic require you to cut

best handymen. Hunt the Iron Shepherds."

02:56:46.724 --> 02:56:49.176
LIAM: One more time, please?

02:56:49.176 --> 02:56:52.099
MATT: "Hunt the Iron Shepherds."

02:56:52.099 --> 02:56:54.846
LIAM: Your accent is thick.

02:56:54.846 --> 02:57:01.107
MATT: "I have not been as far south as some of
you, I can tell."

02:57:01.107 --> 02:57:05.006
LIAM: No, I appreciate hearing the old tongue
again.

02:57:05.006 --> 02:57:15.426
MATT: She says to you in Zemnian, "Well, stick
around." (in Common) "Last I heard, they are still

02:57:15.426 --> 02:57:22.413
"out on the road. They live at The Sour Nest, a
small stronghold not far from here on the edge of

02:57:22.413 --> 02:57:31.005
"North Clover to the eastern side. They have a
number of hired hands that guard the locale. It's

02:57:31.005 --> 02:57:35.465
"a difficult infiltration, but it's your best
chance of catching them off guard. If you have

02:57:35.465 --> 02:57:41.096
"other ideas, we are open to suggestions. Am I to
believe that you have been sent," and her eyes

02:57:41.096 --> 02:57:49.417
fall over Nila, "as trained killers, able to deal
with this?"

02:57:49.417 --> 02:57:54.240
LIAM: Some of us are trained killers for sure, and
we have picked up help as we have seen fit.

02:57:54.240 --> 02:58:04.848
Everyone has been carefully selected, carefully
vetted. I'm sure that with your input on their

02:58:04.848 --> 02:58:13.748
mannerisms and habits, their routines, we will do
quite well.

02:58:13.748 --> 02:58:18.146
MATT: "All right. Let us hope that the priest was
not incorrect. Either way, I would like to see

02:58:18.146 --> 02:58:24.662
"them taken down a peg. So do you accept this
offer?"

02:58:24.662 --> 02:58:28.508
MARISHA: What all do you want us getting out of
that house?

02:58:28.508 --> 02:58:33.763
MATT: "Nothing to get out of it. Kill everything
within it."

02:58:33.763 --> 02:58:39.360
ASHLY: When you say this can't get traced back to
you guys, does that mean you can't help us at all?

02:58:39.360 --> 02:58:43.569
Give us any assistance as far as your men,
firepower, nothing?

02:58:43.569 --> 02:58:51.107
MATT: "No. We can offer maybe a bit of change to
grease a few palms or bring some aid your way, but

02:58:51.107 --> 02:59:00.860
"we cannot be traced to this at all. This needs to
seem unrelated. A strange occurrence, a random act

02:59:00.860 --> 02:59:09.166
"of murder was in their home, so as not to quell
this already boiling blood between us."

02:59:09.166 --> 02:59:12.017
MARISHA: You think all of the Iron Shepherds will
be there?

02:59:12.017 --> 02:59:17.535
MATT: "Well, I don't know. They're there often.
But if you've made it this far north, perhaps you

02:59:17.535 --> 02:59:21.523
"are better at finding this information than we."

02:59:21.523 --> 02:59:31.071
LIAM: We have come a long way. Is there any-- You
know them better than us; we're out-of-towners.

02:59:31.071 --> 02:59:36.762
Any tips to specifically deal with your problem?

02:59:36.762 --> 02:59:46.096
MATT: "Best intel we have involves that they hire
their mercenaries from the Grudge Gang. They

02:59:46.096 --> 02:59:51.374
"prefer to find people with keen eyes and distant
shot."

02:59:51.374 --> 02:59:57.565
SAM: The Grudge Gang-- they've hired the entire
gang, or just the members of the--

02:59:57.565 --> 02:59:58.942
MATT: "Just members of the gang."

02:59:58.942 --> 03:00:00.701
SAM: Where do they hang about?

03:00:00.701 --> 03:00:06.750
MATT: "All over the city, but the ones they've
hired will probably stay within the estate."

03:00:06.750 --> 03:00:12.369
SAM: They would stay there while they're under the
employ of the Iron Shepherds?

03:00:12.369 --> 03:00:16.759
MATT: "Of course. That is what I do." She refers
to the two guards behind you.

03:00:16.759 --> 03:00:20.587
MARISHA: Do you know-- sorry. You can go.

03:00:20.587 --> 03:00:27.831
ASHLY: You said that they're still on the road?
You're led to believe that they haven't come back

03:00:27.831 --> 03:00:29.096
to Shadycreek Run yet?

03:00:29.096 --> 03:00:31.184
MATT: "I haven't seen them return yet, no."

03:00:31.184 --> 03:00:36.169
SAM: Would you know if they came back? Do you have
spies out there looking?

03:00:36.169 --> 03:00:37.199
MATT: "I have."

03:00:37.199 --> 03:00:39.858
SAM: Because we saw them on the road and they were
heading back here.

03:00:39.858 --> 03:00:44.996
MATT: "If they have arrived recently, perhaps my
whispers have not come to me yet."

03:00:44.996 --> 03:00:49.087
ASHLY: There's a chance The Sour Nest is empty, or
less guarded.

03:00:49.087 --> 03:00:52.786
MARISHA: I wonder if they're hiring.

03:00:52.786 --> 03:00:58.995
SAM: Does the Grudge Gang identify themselves in
some way? How would we find one?

03:00:58.995 --> 03:01:08.264
MATT: "They usually--" and she pulls back her
sleeve and you can see the dark gray, almost black

03:01:08.264 --> 03:01:15.992
skin there beneath. "You will find a burned
crescent into the wrist of a member of the gang."

03:01:15.992 --> 03:01:24.916
SAM: Let's get a fireplace and some iron and burn
the shit out of our wrists, and then we're

03:01:24.916 --> 03:01:37.370
insta-Grudge Gang. Now, The Gentleman has us on a
meager yearly salary, but if we were to do this

03:01:37.370 --> 03:01:41.076
for you, does that include some sort of bonus?

03:01:41.076 --> 03:01:43.476
MATT: "Are you saying The Gentleman has not paid
you for this endeavor?"

03:01:43.476 --> 03:01:44.262
SAM: Not yet.

03:01:44.262 --> 03:01:48.181
MATT: "I was made to understand that that was all
taken care of as part of our arrangement."

03:01:48.181 --> 03:01:55.606
MARISHA: How about something in trade? Just as a
little added bonus as a favor.

03:01:55.606 --> 03:02:01.918
MATT: "What are you asking for, if I might
inquire, little girl?" She leans forward with this

03:02:01.918 --> 03:02:06.951
creepy smile that crawls across her face as she
eyes you up and down.

03:02:06.951 --> 03:02:09.078
LIAM: There we go.

03:02:09.078 --> 03:02:14.342
MARISHA: Kind of like her demeaning me with that
little girl stuff. I'm kind of into it. Anyway,

03:02:14.342 --> 03:02:30.303
that priest you mentioned. Is he a pretty skilled
priest? Would he happen to have any skills in

03:02:30.303 --> 03:02:34.758
reviving the dead?

03:02:34.758 --> 03:02:43.922
MATT: "You have a problem with someone beneath the
earth. I do not know if our priest specializes in

03:02:43.922 --> 03:02:49.612
"such abilities, and if they did, it would be for
family only."

03:02:49.612 --> 03:02:56.808
MARISHA: Sounds like he does specialize in those
abilities when you put it like that. If exceptions

03:02:56.808 --> 03:03:05.340
can be made for friends and family. Friends and
family discount is a real thing.

03:03:05.340 --> 03:03:12.854
MATT: "You're mighty presumptuous. You might have
better luck with any of the wandering crazies in

03:03:12.854 --> 03:03:15.274
"the city."

03:03:15.274 --> 03:03:17.521
MARISHA: What?

03:03:17.521 --> 03:03:31.532
MATT: "Our priest is not the only one." She cocks
her head. "If you're looking for help, could look

03:03:31.532 --> 03:03:34.017
"to the Blooming Grove."

03:03:34.017 --> 03:03:36.698
SAM: Where's that? What's that? Is that a town?

03:03:36.698 --> 03:03:45.333
MATT: "It's about six miles out of Shadycreek Run,
to the northwest, a little farther from here. It's

03:03:45.333 --> 03:03:56.303
"a burial grove, but there is a temple there and
some strange hermit of a priest is said to live

03:03:56.303 --> 03:04:03.271
"there. Most folks are spooked of them. The family
that once looked over that grove has slowly

03:04:03.271 --> 03:04:11.834
"dwindled as the years have gone on, and they say
the curse itself seems to hold it, but try that.

03:04:11.834 --> 03:04:22.277
"Otherwise, you need to do quite a favor for us, as
such magic is not inexpensive."

03:04:23.815 --> 03:04:26.951
ASHLY: Killing all of the Iron Shepherds isn't a
big enough favor?

03:04:26.951 --> 03:04:28.465
MATT: "You've already been paid for that."

03:04:28.465 --> 03:04:33.555
LIAM: Yeah, this is a pre-existing arrangement
that's outside of negotiation at the moment. I

03:04:33.555 --> 03:04:37.291
understand. We will take care of what you are
asking.

03:04:37.291 --> 03:04:43.616
MATT: "Good. That's what I like, straightforward
and working to the fine print. Very good."

03:04:43.616 --> 03:04:48.794
LIAM: Zemnian.

03:04:48.794 --> 03:04:55.792
SAM: All right. You don't want us staying here, I
suppose? We should scoot out so that we can't be

03:04:55.792 --> 03:04:59.115
traced back to you?

03:04:59.115 --> 03:05:08.789
MATT: "We'll lead you out the back route. Eyes on
you leaving my estate would be unwise. So." Begins

03:05:08.789 --> 03:05:12.394
speaking in Zemnian to the two other guards--
you're the only one who picks up on the language--

03:05:12.394 --> 03:05:21.214
says, "Please lead them through the back tunnel."
She turns around and begins to ascend the stairs,

03:05:21.214 --> 03:05:25.459
stopping and looking back over her shoulder, the
hair swishing with each step as she makes her way

03:05:25.459 --> 03:05:30.615
up, looking back, and the yellow eyes glancing
back with the bright white teeth against the

03:05:30.615 --> 03:05:46.368
darkened skin. "Do not disappoint me. I can be
very frustrated when I'm disappointed." Turns back

03:05:46.368 --> 03:05:48.885
and makes her way back up the steps.

03:05:48.885 --> 03:05:50.718
LIAM: We're left with guards?

03:05:50.718 --> 03:05:52.466
MATT: Two guards, yes.

03:05:52.466 --> 03:06:00.557
LIAM: All right, good fellows, would you escort us
out and point us in the right direction?

03:06:00.557 --> 03:06:11.648
MATT: They wordlessly walk and lead you around
through a dining chamber back to a small storage--

03:06:11.648 --> 03:06:16.961
it'd be kitchen adjacent, though you don't see a
kitchen yet. You can smell that musty scent of

03:06:16.961 --> 03:06:20.788
stored oats and grains, rice.

03:06:20.788 --> 03:06:22.898
LIAM: Did I see any books on the way out?

03:06:22.898 --> 03:06:25.468
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:06:27.554 --> 03:06:29.050
LIAM: 14.

03:06:29.050 --> 03:06:36.471
MATT: None down here. None of the rooms you were
brought through seem to have any sort of a shelf

03:06:36.471 --> 03:06:40.343
unit or anything that carries tomes or books of
any kind, unfortunately.

03:06:40.343 --> 03:06:43.462
LIAM: Fuck this podunk town.

03:06:43.462 --> 03:06:49.476
MATT: There doesn't seem to be very well-read
people though there're probably some. You're led

03:06:49.476 --> 03:06:56.131
into this storage room and down a staircase
through a trapdoor. It's pulled open. You're led

03:06:56.131 --> 03:07:04.622
into this wine cellar and in the back of the wine
cellar, they move aside a case shelving for wine,

03:07:04.622 --> 03:07:08.386
and they're all resting on it, some missing,
others moving it there. There's a small tunnel

03:07:08.386 --> 03:07:13.374
that you all have to duck down. You have to nearly
crawl through to get your rather large firbolg form.

03:07:13.374 --> 03:07:15.959
ASHLY: Can I sleight of hand and try to steal some
wine?

03:07:15.959 --> 03:07:17.158
MATT: Sure.

03:07:17.158 --> 03:07:20.335
MARISHA: I was about to ask if I recognize any
wine.

03:07:20.335 --> 03:07:22.382
MATT: You're moving pretty fast. Make a perception
check.

03:07:22.382 --> 03:07:23.654
MARISHA: Okay.

03:07:23.654 --> 03:07:25.140
ASHLY: Maybe I shouldn't.

03:07:25.140 --> 03:07:26.883
SAM: Oh, it's too late now.

03:07:26.883 --> 03:07:28.836
ASHLY: Oh, it's great! 18.

03:07:28.836 --> 03:07:30.306
MATT: What'd you get?

03:07:30.306 --> 03:07:31.347
MARISHA: Nine.

03:07:31.347 --> 03:07:36.961
MATT: Unfortunately, you can't see any of the
labels the way it's rested. However, you do manage

03:07:36.961 --> 03:07:38.550
to grab a bottle of wine.

03:07:38.550 --> 03:07:41.918
SAM: Ooh, is that a Cabernet Sauvignon?

03:07:45.159 --> 03:07:49.800
MATT: You guys are brought through single-file
through this tunnel until eventually, met with

03:07:49.800 --> 03:08:03.382
another door. The guard (knocking) does some sort
of pulsed knock. It opens and from this completely

03:08:03.382 --> 03:08:07.038
dark interior, the light hits your eyes and you
have to adjust for a moment. It's really not that

03:08:07.038 --> 03:08:11.871
bright on the opposite side; it's still within the
forest. Comparatively, it hits you. As you step

03:08:11.871 --> 03:08:17.470
out, there looks to be an older drunk, dirty,
filthy-looking man who is completely sober and

03:08:17.470 --> 03:08:19.208
lets you out.

03:08:19.208 --> 03:08:21.556
MARISHA: That's cool.

03:08:21.556 --> 03:08:26.733
MATT: You are now in the middle of the forest, and
you can see a small bench and an overgrown well

03:08:26.733 --> 03:08:32.660
about ten or so feet ahead and to the left of you
that vines have completely taken over. The vines

03:08:32.660 --> 03:08:37.909
themselves, a similar purple-grayish color as to
the rest of the leaves. A lot of the foliage seems

03:08:37.909 --> 03:08:45.221
to fall into that same coloration. Not all of it,
but a lot of it. It seems to cross multiple types

03:08:45.221 --> 03:08:54.256
of vegetation. As you're escorted from this room,
the two guards give a nod, close it behind you.

03:08:54.256 --> 03:09:00.382
The old man goes and sits back, puts his bench up
against the knotted base of a thick tree that's

03:09:00.382 --> 03:09:05.128
growing out of the ground where you had emerged
from. Leans against it, grabs a jug and sits and

03:09:05.128 --> 03:09:09.462
looks at you.

03:09:09.462 --> 03:09:12.296
ASHLY: Can I tell where The Sour Nest would be
from here?

03:09:12.296 --> 03:09:14.468
MATT: Make a survival check.

03:09:16.982 --> 03:09:18.391
ASHLY: 18.

03:09:18.391 --> 03:09:23.290
MATT: With how far you've traveled north, it would
be straight due east from here.

03:09:23.290 --> 03:09:28.473
ASHLY: Okay. Sour Nest is east of here.

03:09:28.473 --> 03:09:30.715
LIAM: You know where you are?

03:09:30.715 --> 03:09:35.550
SAM: Should we go run recon? Take a quick scouting
pass and see what we can see?

03:09:35.550 --> 03:09:39.388
LIAM: Yeah. Let's put a little distance between
ourselves and this place and this gentleman and I

03:09:39.388 --> 03:09:42.176
will send Frumpkin out to have a look.

03:09:42.176 --> 03:09:44.135
SAM: Okay.

03:09:44.135 --> 03:09:49.880
MATT: You make your way through the Savalierwood.

03:09:49.880 --> 03:09:53.036
SAM: Is it a long walk? Or a long travel?

03:09:53.036 --> 03:10:01.401
MATT: From where you are now, it's probably a two
hour walk. It's the far east side. It's

03:10:01.401 --> 03:10:13.208
technically past the-- let's see, I have all the
locations here. Pardon me as I pull out my notes.

03:10:13.208 --> 03:10:19.394
LIAM: While you look, I will say an important
point for clarification. Once we are out of the

03:10:19.394 --> 03:10:23.326
view of this gentleman guarding the secret
entrance, Caleb, walking with poise up to a tree,

03:10:23.326 --> 03:10:27.298
leans against it, bends down and has a panic
attack.

03:10:27.298 --> 03:10:28.563
SAM: You were in great in there!

03:10:28.563 --> 03:10:31.202
MATT: Past the Gruff Slum is what it is. This is
the far eastern side of it.

03:10:31.202 --> 03:10:32.259
ASHLY: Past the Gruff Stump?

03:10:32.259 --> 03:10:33.044
MATT: The Gruff Slum.

03:10:33.044 --> 03:10:40.653
SAM: You were great! You handled yourself so well.
Man, you were rock-solid in there!

03:10:40.653 --> 03:10:45.880
LIAM: Stop it. I am nauseous. Let's go kill a
bunch of people.

03:10:45.880 --> 03:10:46.832
SAM: Give him a goodberry.

03:10:46.832 --> 03:10:47.908
SUMALEE: I have a goodberry.

03:10:47.908 --> 03:10:49.469
MARISHA: Oh, yes!

03:10:49.469 --> 03:10:54.040
LIAM: That is sour.

03:10:54.040 --> 03:10:56.729
SAM: It's a Purin tablet.

03:10:56.729 --> 03:11:01.554
SUMALEE: One moment, it will take effect soon.

03:11:01.554 --> 03:11:02.749
ASHLY: Oh. End that way.

03:11:02.749 --> 03:11:03.478
MARISHA: Keep it down.

03:11:03.478 --> 03:11:04.617
LIAM: Let's go.

03:11:04.617 --> 03:11:09.389
MATT: It does warm your belly, and that warmth
spreads through your torso and it's-- whenever

03:11:09.389 --> 03:11:18.125
Jester has come and pulled you from the edge of
death with a spell, it's a fragment of that warmth

03:11:18.125 --> 03:11:21.806
from the inside of your torso.

03:11:21.806 --> 03:11:23.660
LIAM: 'Member?

03:11:23.660 --> 03:11:27.650
MARISHA: 'Member berries. 'Member Jester?

03:11:27.650 --> 03:11:29.203
LIAM: 'Member clerics?

03:11:29.203 --> 03:11:33.640
MARISHA: Oh yeah, I 'member.

03:11:38.314 --> 03:11:43.716
MATT: Following Keg through the wood, I would like
you all to make stealth checks, please.

03:11:43.716 --> 03:11:47.042
SAM: Stealthy!

03:11:47.042 --> 03:11:49.798
MATT: You are no longer under the Pass without a
Trace spell.

03:11:49.798 --> 03:11:51.971
MARISHA: You get all of your spells back after
sleeping as well.

03:11:51.971 --> 03:11:54.062
LIAM: Four!

03:11:55.621 --> 03:11:56.883
ASHLY: 14.

03:11:56.883 --> 03:11:58.739
SAM: 25.

03:11:58.739 --> 03:11:59.892
MARISHA: 17.

03:11:59.892 --> 03:12:03.470
SUMALEE: 14.

03:12:03.470 --> 03:12:10.714
MATT: Caleb's feeling a bit clumsy, but the rest
of you, keeping up the slack, have managed to stop

03:12:10.714 --> 03:12:18.142
him at times and make him aware of his terrible
attempts to stay out of sight and stay quiet. Two

03:12:18.142 --> 03:12:21.951
hours of travel eastward--

03:12:21.951 --> 03:12:23.969
MARISHA: We should plan.

03:12:23.969 --> 03:12:25.544
ASHLY: We wanted to send Frumpkin in.

03:12:25.544 --> 03:12:31.558
SAM: We can send Frumpkin, but also, we have
another animal companion now. If you wanted to

03:12:31.558 --> 03:12:36.555
become an animal something or other and scout
around, that would be acceptable, right?

03:12:36.555 --> 03:12:37.768
MARISHA: That's true.

03:12:37.768 --> 03:12:42.832
SUMALEE: I would love that. What animal do you
think would be the best? Maybe something small?

03:12:42.832 --> 03:12:44.718
MARISHA: And something native.

03:12:44.718 --> 03:12:46.816
SAM: Well, Frumpkin's a bird, right?

03:12:46.816 --> 03:12:47.552
LIAM: Yeah.

03:12:47.552 --> 03:12:52.059
SAM: Maybe we need something on the ground, like a
weasel-y thing or a ratty type of thing or a

03:12:52.059 --> 03:12:53.800
roachy type of thing?

03:12:53.800 --> 03:12:59.971
LIAM: You said yesterday that-- you were a horse
first and then you said you could only do it one

03:12:59.971 --> 03:13:02.723
more time or a certain number of times, correct?

03:13:02.723 --> 03:13:06.395
SUMALEE: Yes, I have two times now, right? Because
I rested?

03:13:06.395 --> 03:13:08.460
MATT: Correct. Two times every short rest.

03:13:08.460 --> 03:13:09.825
SUMALEE: I can do twice.

03:13:09.825 --> 03:13:13.562
LIAM: If you were to become, say, a raccoon right
now and go running around, that is one time that

03:13:13.562 --> 03:13:16.972
you cannot become a crocodile to eat somebody's
face off.

03:13:16.972 --> 03:13:21.393
SUMALEE: Yes, and I would like to eat somebody's
face off.

03:13:21.393 --> 03:13:31.400
LIAM: Okay. I think, let us reserve that for now
because Frumpkin can do the job. Let's get closer

03:13:31.400 --> 03:13:36.463
to this place and it would only take five minutes.
He will go.

03:13:36.463 --> 03:13:38.704
SAM: In owl form?

03:13:38.704 --> 03:13:39.650
LIAM: Yeah.

03:13:39.650 --> 03:13:46.381
SAM: Okay. He'll only be able to see from the sky.
We should still do that, though, first.

03:13:46.381 --> 03:13:51.786
LIAM: I mean, I could turn him back into a cat,
but then he's slower, he can't get over the walls maybe.

03:13:51.786 --> 03:13:52.900
SAM: Go for it.

03:13:52.900 --> 03:13:53.785
MARISHA: Just send the bird.

03:13:53.785 --> 03:13:55.647
LIAM: How far have we traveled at this point?

03:13:55.647 --> 03:14:14.456
MATT: About an hour into it, a sound catches your
ear, Keg. It catches yours as well. (growling) You

03:14:14.456 --> 03:14:22.042
hear the faint breaking of tinder and dry branch.

03:14:22.042 --> 03:14:25.275
ASHLY: Do I know what this is off the top or must
I make a check?

03:14:25.275 --> 03:14:30.036
MATT: Make a straight intelligence check.

03:14:30.036 --> 03:14:33.221
ASHLY: (singing) Ooh, that's not going to go well
for anyone.

03:14:33.221 --> 03:14:35.060
LIAM: Unless you roll high.

03:14:35.060 --> 03:14:35.855
SUMALEE: 20!

03:14:35.855 --> 03:14:37.068
LIAM: Nope.

03:14:37.068 --> 03:14:39.307
SUMALEE and MARISHA: Oh!

03:14:39.307 --> 03:14:41.327
SAM: Yeah, but it's minus one.

03:14:41.327 --> 03:14:46.971
ASHLY: So it's zero! Did I help?

03:14:46.971 --> 03:14:52.702
MATT: You have no idea, but it sounds unique.

03:14:52.702 --> 03:14:56.398
LIAM: Ducks, you guys. It's ducks.

03:14:56.398 --> 03:14:57.855
ASHLY: We're fine, keep going.

03:14:57.859 --> 03:14:59.820
SAM: Oh, great!

03:14:59.912 --> 03:15:03.064
ASHLY: But Nila also recognizes it?

03:15:03.064 --> 03:15:07.947
MATT: You hear it as well. What's your perception?
Your passive perception?

03:15:09.127 --> 03:15:10.111
SUMALEE: 14.

03:15:10.111 --> 03:15:15.763
MATT: 14. You'd actually hear it as well. You guys
all put your hands out, stop, and hold still. You

03:15:15.763 --> 03:15:21.831
see a heavy shadow moving through the dense
forest, just south of where you are.

03:15:21.831 --> 03:15:29.940
MARISHA: Nobody move. You want to send an owl
towards that shadow, see if Frumpkin sees what

03:15:29.940 --> 03:15:31.083
that is?

03:15:31.083 --> 03:15:35.517
LIAM: <i>Ja,</i> okay, that's easy. I sit down on the
ground and send Frumpkin into the air.

03:15:35.517 --> 03:15:41.296
MATT: Okay. Under a branch, Frumpkin takes some of
the low branches of these trees, underneath the

03:15:41.296 --> 03:15:50.106
canopy and gets a look. Through Frumpkin's eyes,
you see what looks to be a black bear, but black

03:15:50.106 --> 03:16:00.163
bears that you've seen in passing before have
been, maybe, eight feet, ten feet end to end. This

03:16:00.163 --> 03:16:08.717
one's closer to 15 and about ten feet to shoulder.
Its fur is long and matted, almost greasy in

03:16:08.717 --> 03:16:16.213
patches. At the shoulders and the elbows and
ridges on its face, you see bone protrusions, like spikes.

03:16:16.213 --> 03:16:18.734
MARISHA: Those were the bone spikes.

03:16:18.734 --> 03:16:25.408
MATT: As it comes through you watch its large,
heavy, almost exaggerated muscular shoulders

03:16:25.408 --> 03:16:39.828
(sounds of bear walking, growling, and sniffing)
It sits down on the ground. It seems to have

03:16:39.828 --> 03:16:44.755
chosen a spot to take a nap.

03:16:44.755 --> 03:16:48.182
ASHLY: Do I have a sense of what aggros it?

03:16:48.182 --> 03:16:54.154
MATT: Noise. People. Anything that it could eat.

03:16:54.154 --> 03:16:59.473
LIAM: (whispering) There is a very large black
bear ahead of us, with bones coming out of its

03:16:59.473 --> 03:17:04.261
butt and stuff and it has just laid down for a
nap.

03:17:04.261 --> 03:17:06.900
SAM: (whispering) We have to be very quiet.

03:17:06.900 --> 03:17:09.877
MARISHA: (whispering) Can you do that thing
again?

03:17:09.877 --> 03:17:11.668
SAM: That makes us all stealthy?

03:17:11.668 --> 03:17:14.462
SUMALEE: (whispering) Yes, of course.

03:17:14.462 --> 03:17:16.514
MARISHA: (whispering) So we can all sneak by?

03:17:16.514 --> 03:17:19.994
SUMALEE: (barely audible) I would like to cast
Pass Without a Trace.

03:17:19.994 --> 03:17:21.867
(laughter)

03:17:21.867 --> 03:17:26.984
MATT: Okay. With that addition, everyone roll
another stealth check, since you are taking the

03:17:26.984 --> 03:17:28.416
bonus there.

03:17:28.416 --> 03:17:29.418
LIAM: What are we going to do?

03:17:29.418 --> 03:17:31.587
ASHLY: 23.

03:17:31.587 --> 03:17:36.009
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil. Eh, fuck you, Gil.

03:17:36.009 --> 03:17:37.677
MATT: Is that with the plus ten?

03:17:37.677 --> 03:17:40.647
ASHLY: Without, so I'm at 33.

03:17:40.647 --> 03:17:44.974
MATT: But you do have heavy armor, so you do have
disadvantage on your stealth checks, I remember that.

03:17:44.974 --> 03:17:48.680
ASHLY: With ten, it's 23 again.

03:17:48.680 --> 03:17:51.418
MATT: There you go, it's still pretty good.

03:17:51.418 --> 03:17:53.245
SAM: 39.

03:17:53.245 --> 03:17:56.553
MATT: There's the numbers!

03:17:56.553 --> 03:17:57.715
LIAM: 26.

03:17:57.715 --> 03:17:59.153
MARISHA: 21.

03:17:59.153 --> 03:18:07.723
SUMALEE: I rolled a d20 plus ten, right? Oh, plus
my-- that's why, I was like, it seems low. 27.

03:18:07.723 --> 03:18:16.677
MATT: As it's sleeping, the heavy breathing almost
audible as you curve around the space where it is,

03:18:16.677 --> 03:18:23.293
trying desperately to not step on anything that
would make a large snapping or shifting sound in

03:18:23.293 --> 03:18:29.175
its presence. You watch as another comes up.

03:18:29.175 --> 03:18:31.820
(groaning)

03:18:31.820 --> 03:18:44.937
MATT: Alongside it, (growls), awakens slightly and
sits down next to it and while it's not sleeping,

03:18:44.937 --> 03:18:54.331
is keeping watch as it releases out of its jaw,
onto the ground a very bloodied and battered body

03:18:54.331 --> 03:18:58.148
of some person, you cannot make any details of
them at this distance.

03:18:58.148 --> 03:18:59.803
SAM: Dead?

03:18:59.803 --> 03:19:07.482
MATT: Definitely not living! As you begin to walk,
you begin to hear the terrible crunching sound as

03:19:07.482 --> 03:19:12.242
its giant jaws snap into bone and tear into
flesh.

03:19:12.242 --> 03:19:13.901
LIAM: You guys, Taliesin's a bear.

03:19:13.901 --> 03:19:17.251
(laughter)

03:19:17.251 --> 03:19:23.136
MATT: You do manage to just skirt along the side
of the bear without any notice from their side.

03:19:23.136 --> 03:19:33.246
Continuing onward. The secondary hour goes without
issue, but you do begin to come upon the outskirts

03:19:33.246 --> 03:19:40.314
of your recollection of where The Sour Nest
resides. You're still a good 100 or so feet away,

03:19:40.314 --> 03:19:46.517
using the trees at your disposal and you can see
now the wall that matches the perimeter. It's a

03:19:46.517 --> 03:19:59.477
thin, five foot wide wall with a very flimsy rail
across the top, but it is a walkway for watch

03:19:59.477 --> 03:20:04.560
guards to keep an eye out. As you glance at this
distance, you can see one figure that's walking

03:20:04.560 --> 03:20:11.389
the perimeter of the top of the wall, with a heavy
crossbow at the ready. They stop and look out.

03:20:12.019 --> 03:20:14.410
LIAM: How dense is the forest around this place?

03:20:14.410 --> 03:20:20.311
MATT: It's pretty dense. The reason it took two
hours to get there is because you're going through

03:20:20.311 --> 03:20:25.679
the forest. Otherwise on foot, in any sort of open
scenario, it would take you half the time.

03:20:25.679 --> 03:20:31.477
LIAM: There's no manicured, open place around.
It's just nestled among trees around it or--?

03:20:31.477 --> 03:20:35.837
MATT: It looks there is manicured to be about a
ten-foot distance between the wall and any of the

03:20:35.837 --> 03:20:43.786
surrounding trees, specifically to make sure that
any sort of approaching individuals would be out

03:20:43.786 --> 03:20:48.496
in the open. You can see now a little bit of light
is coming through. It looks like they've cleared

03:20:48.496 --> 03:20:54.024
out a bit of the canopy, not entirely, but a bit
of it to also prevent any low-hanging boughs or

03:20:54.024 --> 03:21:01.978
branches to curl into the interior of the walls.
It's not a massive stronghold, it looks to be

03:21:01.978 --> 03:21:09.672
approximately a little larger than the Estate
Sybaritic that you were at, but it's more for

03:21:09.672 --> 03:21:17.483
function than beautiful decor. A lot of the wood
seems to be old and weathered from rain and dry

03:21:17.483 --> 03:21:25.658
seasons. It's just a beige- and gray-looking
establishment. Pure function.

03:21:26.321 --> 03:21:30.234
LIAM: Our lot is hidden in the trees, a ways
away?

03:21:30.234 --> 03:21:35.977
MATT: Yes. You can barely see it above the wall,
but the little bit you can see has that visual and

03:21:35.977 --> 03:21:40.643
you can see it's a mixture of stone and wood. The
edges of the actual structure are stone and then

03:21:40.643 --> 03:21:46.502
wood is either then placed over stone or wood is
the intermediate construction material.

03:21:46.502 --> 03:21:48.810
ASHLY: The cart is not back?

03:21:48.810 --> 03:21:52.482
MATT: From this perspective, you don't see where
the cart would come in.

03:21:52.482 --> 03:21:55.145
LIAM: This is where we send an owl.

03:21:55.145 --> 03:21:56.638
SAM: Sure.

03:21:56.638 --> 03:22:02.312
LIAM: I'm going to send him and it's going to take
a moment. I want him to go around the entire place

03:22:02.312 --> 03:22:08.481
and keep an eye on it and watch it. Maybe 20 or 30
minutes. Are we good with that?

03:22:08.481 --> 03:22:17.145
SAM: In his talons, he could bring a little mouse
and drop it in there. I'm just saying.

03:22:17.145 --> 03:22:22.646
LIAM: How will we-- You and I could talk to the
mouse.

03:22:22.646 --> 03:22:28.149
SAM: We could, but the mouse couldn't talk back.

03:22:28.149 --> 03:22:31.561
ASHLY: Wait, wait, wait, what's our plan here?

03:22:31.561 --> 03:22:37.154
LIAM: Well, for now this is easy, we're going to
send my owl now. If anything goes wrong, will you

03:22:37.154 --> 03:22:42.826
please tap three times on my left knee? I go blind
and send Frumpkin up.

03:22:42.826 --> 03:22:54.063
MATT: Okay, so, Frumpkin makes it up. Tree, waits
a moment, tree. The one guard you see doing the

03:22:54.063 --> 03:22:57.732
perimeter notices.

03:22:57.732 --> 03:23:05.318
LIAM: I tell him telepathically to just chill and
sit there for a while.

03:23:05.318 --> 03:23:14.638
MATT: After a minute or so, the guard just keeps
looking out. Jumpy. From Frumpkin's view, down

03:23:14.638 --> 03:23:23.559
inside, you can see the exterior of this. There is
a large collection of brown wood kegs and a couple

03:23:23.559 --> 03:23:30.819
of small crates that contain materials that you're
unaware of. You can see there are two entrances,

03:23:30.819 --> 03:23:37.139
one at the front and one at the back of the
building. There are not windows, but small holes

03:23:37.139 --> 03:23:44.979
put into the wood and from the inside-- Actually,
roll a perception check for Frumpkin, thank you.

03:23:44.979 --> 03:23:49.551
With advantage, due to the form, because it is
with sight.

03:23:49.551 --> 03:23:52.150
LIAM: Perception, you say? 22.

03:23:52.150 --> 03:23:58.721
MATT: 22. Looking through these curved window
ports about that big, essentially large enough to

03:23:58.721 --> 03:24:04.893
look through and fire through, but small enough to
not really allow a person to push through. You can

03:24:04.893 --> 03:24:11.400
see there's about two inches of stone, so it is a
stone structure that has wood as a decorated

03:24:11.400 --> 03:24:20.312
exterior to it, so it's pretty solid. Down inside,
you do see about six horses that are hitched on

03:24:20.312 --> 03:24:27.896
the back side of it and two carts and a third one
that is currently being repaired.

03:24:27.896 --> 03:24:29.643
SAM: Those are our carts!

03:24:29.643 --> 03:24:33.562
LIAM: How many people do I see down inside?

03:24:33.562 --> 03:24:40.070
MATT: There's one up top on the wall. You now see
with Frumpkin, thanks to that perception roll, a

03:24:40.070 --> 03:24:43.407
secondary guard on the opposite side of the wall.
It looks like there are two doing a perimeter

03:24:43.407 --> 03:24:47.227
pass, matching each other so that at any given
point in time they have a visual perspective on

03:24:47.227 --> 03:24:54.583
one or the other's side of the estate. You see one
more guard that is inside the courtyard and it

03:24:54.669 --> 03:25:03.581
looks like two individuals that are not in general
attire of the hired hands. The guards are wearing

03:25:03.581 --> 03:25:11.993
the same hooded cloak and armament as the two that
were pulling the caravan up with them.

03:25:11.993 --> 03:25:15.002
ASHLY: Those are definitely the caravans? The
carts that Frumpkin sees are the ones that we--?

03:25:15.002 --> 03:25:19.916
MATT: They are very much. The one that's been
broken has been carried along the way and

03:25:19.916 --> 03:25:25.159
temporarily fixed for the journey, but now has two
individuals of plain clothes that are in the

03:25:25.159 --> 03:25:27.083
process of repairing the cart.

03:25:27.083 --> 03:25:28.571
LIAM: Total two up top?

03:25:28.571 --> 03:25:34.399
MATT: Two up top, one on the inside that's armed,
and two that are currently repairing the cart that

03:25:34.399 --> 03:25:43.897
appear to be unarmed. You gather from the state of
repairs that the arrival was probably not that

03:25:43.897 --> 03:25:47.571
long before you arrived.

03:25:47.571 --> 03:25:51.751
ASHLY: So much for getting the jump on them.

03:25:51.751 --> 03:26:01.333
MARISHA: Three guards, two hired hands, and were
there two more regular individuals?

03:26:01.333 --> 03:26:06.874
MATT: No, there were two guards on the wall, only
one you see inside the courtyard, and then two

03:26:06.874 --> 03:26:14.243
handymen. You don't really know if they work for
them full-time or if they're a temporary hire, but

03:26:14.243 --> 03:26:17.911
there are two men that are not in the general
attire of the rest of the guards of the estate

03:26:17.911 --> 03:26:19.998
that are currently repairing.

03:26:19.998 --> 03:26:22.652
LIAM: They definitely don't know any ice magic.

03:26:22.652 --> 03:26:30.439
ASHLY: Definitely sorcerers, definitely no ice
magic. Definitely. Is it accurate to say that if

03:26:30.439 --> 03:26:33.998
we were to find Grudge Gang members that were
unaffiliated, that we could pay them?

03:26:33.998 --> 03:26:35.989
MATT: If you have enough.

03:26:35.989 --> 03:26:39.889
ASHLY: Okay, because from where I'm sitting, I
don't know how this is going to go much different

03:26:39.889 --> 03:26:45.082
than what happened before. We might need more
people.

03:26:45.082 --> 03:26:50.583
MATT: The Grudge Gang, they can be expensive and
also they're not keen on suicide missions if they

03:26:50.583 --> 03:26:54.745
have no stake in it. But if they have a stake in
it, and you pay well enough, and you have

03:26:54.745 --> 03:26:58.494
assurances and enough to back you up, they'll go
with it.

03:26:58.494 --> 03:27:01.572
ASHLY: Would the Taskers have more of a stake?

03:27:01.572 --> 03:27:04.898
MATT: You're not sure. You've never really
interacted with them much. You know of them, but

03:27:04.898 --> 03:27:11.411
because of your affiliation previously, you're
pretty insulated from dealing with those folks.

03:27:11.411 --> 03:27:21.070
You grew up hating a lot of the bits of authority
that existed around here and now you're finding

03:27:21.070 --> 03:27:24.249
yourself having to eat crow for a lifetime of--

03:27:24.249 --> 03:27:27.987
ASHLY: It's like my thing. Yeah, it's my new
thing: eating crow.

03:27:27.987 --> 03:27:32.323
LIAM: Did you say how big the structure within the
wall is?

03:27:32.323 --> 03:27:42.493
MATT: The structure within, I'd say it's maybe 50
feet on one side, maybe 70 or 80 on the other.

03:27:42.493 --> 03:27:50.283
It's hard to really gauge the full distance. It's
a fairly large estate that's been fitted into a

03:27:50.283 --> 03:27:54.836
small stronghold.

03:27:54.836 --> 03:28:00.417
MARISHA: Could make a distraction in the woods,
get one of the guard's attention. Bring them in

03:28:00.417 --> 03:28:03.827
one at a time. Ambush them. Take their wardrobe.

03:28:03.827 --> 03:28:05.747
ASHLY: Or we could watch them for awhile.

03:28:05.747 --> 03:28:12.823
SAM: You have a sword that can teleport you. You
could bamf up onto the walkway with them and knock

03:28:12.823 --> 03:28:16.907
one off, and we could kill him.

03:28:16.907 --> 03:28:21.540
MARISHA: Between me and Nila, we could actually
get in pretty quickly. I could get in with the

03:28:22.464 --> 03:28:25.575
sword and she could be dropped in as a mouse.

03:28:25.575 --> 03:28:27.452
ASHLY: The Iron Shepherds aren't there?

03:28:27.452 --> 03:28:29.011
MATT: You don't know.

03:28:29.011 --> 03:28:30.331
ASHLY: Frumpkin doesn't see?

03:28:30.331 --> 03:28:33.268
MATT: Frumpkin doesn't see them.

03:28:33.268 --> 03:28:42.718
SAM: We can certainly kill a guard. That would
give us a costume, but what does that get us?

03:28:43.009 --> 03:28:50.622
LIAM: They find a dead man on their perimeter and
know that someone is fucking with them.

03:28:50.622 --> 03:28:58.237
SAM: We can drag his body off and feed it to a
bear. Steal his clothes. They'll be like "Where

03:28:58.237 --> 03:29:09.827
"did he go? Where did Phil go? Oh, Phil. You know,
that old story." Or we drop in mouse girl and she

03:29:09.827 --> 03:29:16.057
could run around inside and find out if her son is
in there, and our friends.

03:29:19.323 --> 03:29:30.652
SUMALEE: I'm so confused. The carts that we see
were the ones that I've seen people go into

03:29:30.652 --> 03:29:36.882
before, but we don't see the Iron Shepherds here.

03:29:36.882 --> 03:29:39.461
ASHLY: We don't see where the prisoners are being
kept?

03:29:39.461 --> 03:29:47.200
MATT: You don't see that, but you know. The
basement below. There are three separate chambers:

03:29:47.200 --> 03:29:56.557
one that's for holding, one that's for breaking,
which is torture, and the one that is for display

03:29:56.557 --> 03:30:05.672
if they have any final approvals by the Jagontoth
family that has an idea of where they should be sent to.

03:30:05.768 --> 03:30:09.033
SUMALEE: This is our best chance, because there
are no Iron Shepherds here.

03:30:09.033 --> 03:30:10.705
ASHLY and SAM: We don't know.

03:30:10.705 --> 03:30:17.899
LIAM: They could be inside. This is not any better
than our chances on the road.

03:30:17.899 --> 03:30:22.586
MARISHA: Well, then we do one of two things. We
either send in Nila as a mouse to scout to see if

03:30:22.586 --> 03:30:29.979
The Iron Shepherds are in there, or we wait and we
watch and we see who comes in and out. Watch the

03:30:29.979 --> 03:30:34.320
guard shifts, see when the changeover is.

03:30:34.320 --> 03:30:36.475
SUMALEE: I want to go in.

03:30:36.475 --> 03:30:44.497
MARISHA: A guard shift would be the most opportune
time to attack. When they're changing shifts.

03:30:44.497 --> 03:30:47.024
ASHLY: Do we have any interest in trying to get
more people?

03:30:47.024 --> 03:30:51.948
SAM: Sure. Yes. I don't know how much money we
have.

03:30:51.948 --> 03:30:54.434
ASHLY: Do I have a sense of how expensive the
Grudge Gang is?

03:30:54.434 --> 03:30:59.542
MATT: You've never hired any of them, so you're
not sure, but the way to ask would be to go find them.

03:30:59.542 --> 03:31:06.374
LIAM: Looking through Frumpkin's eyes, was I able
to see the entrance through this wall that the

03:31:06.374 --> 03:31:12.145
guards are up top on? What's the way in here?

03:31:12.145 --> 03:31:14.697
MATT: On the opposite end, it looks to be
ladders.

03:31:14.697 --> 03:31:16.984
LIAM: No gate or doorway at all?

03:31:16.984 --> 03:31:22.699
MATT: Oh, sorry. I thought you meant how they got
up onto the wall, my apologies. There is a gate in

03:31:22.699 --> 03:31:29.500
the front and there is a gate in the back. The
gate in the back is-- actually, both gates are two

03:31:29.500 --> 03:31:35.717
dark wood doors that have a brace set down that
holds them in place that is held and controlled

03:31:35.717 --> 03:31:37.137
from the interior.

03:31:37.137 --> 03:31:38.104
LIAM: Solid?

03:31:38.104 --> 03:31:38.811
MATT: Solid.

03:31:38.811 --> 03:31:41.496
LIAM: None of this?

03:31:41.496 --> 03:31:45.378
MATT: On both sides it looks like a single brace
that comes down from one side.

03:31:45.378 --> 03:31:49.468
ASHLY: The back gate, is that pressed against the
forest?

03:31:49.468 --> 03:31:56.996
MATT: Both gates have about a ten-foot open space
before it reaches forest. There are stumps and

03:31:56.996 --> 03:32:02.982
there are places where trees were cleared out,
specifically to give that opening so that they'd

03:32:02.982 --> 03:32:08.106
have a good idea and good visual on anybody who'd
attempt to approach.

03:32:08.106 --> 03:32:13.906
MARISHA: Keg, do you know if these people would
have a secret entrance into the basement, to the

03:32:13.906 --> 03:32:18.509
dungeon area? Tunnels?

03:32:18.509 --> 03:32:20.500
ASHLY: Do I have some sense of that?

03:32:20.500 --> 03:32:27.606
MATT: You didn't work close enough with them to
know of any secret passage. I mean, it makes

03:32:27.606 --> 03:32:34.982
sense. There might be one, but nothing that you've
come across. If there is one, it's a well-guarded

03:32:34.982 --> 03:32:38.125
secret. You have no idea.

03:32:38.125 --> 03:32:40.865
ASHLY: Has anything changed since last I was here,
that I can tell?

03:32:40.865 --> 03:32:44.820
MATT: Not really. They're not into renovations.

03:32:44.820 --> 03:32:45.586
ASHLY: Sure.

03:32:45.586 --> 03:32:49.041
MATT: If it works, stick with it.

03:32:49.041 --> 03:32:54.672
MARISHA: Do the guards sleep here on the estate,
or do they go home at night?

03:32:54.672 --> 03:32:56.298
ASHLY: I'd assume they'd stay on the estate.

03:32:56.298 --> 03:33:03.699
MATT: They sleep on the estate. They're paid
essentially as live-in employ guards.

03:33:03.699 --> 03:33:08.727
ASHLY: I don't know how we do this.

03:33:08.727 --> 03:33:13.268
SUMALEE: I just want to see my son. I want to go
inside.

03:33:13.268 --> 03:33:16.608
SAM: You want to go in and scout around?

03:33:16.608 --> 03:33:19.433
ASHLY: How long does your magic last?

03:33:19.433 --> 03:33:21.174
SUMALEE: Good question.

03:33:21.174 --> 03:33:25.475
MATT: For you, it's half your druid level, rounded
down, so per transformation, it's about two hours.

03:33:25.475 --> 03:33:28.698
LIAM: How do you get out if you are in a mouse?

03:33:28.698 --> 03:33:30.941
MARISHA: Through a gate.

03:33:30.941 --> 03:33:33.190
LIAM: The gates are solid.

03:33:33.190 --> 03:33:34.786
MARISHA: I thought you said there was a--

03:33:34.786 --> 03:33:36.460
LIAM: That's why I asked.

03:33:36.460 --> 03:33:38.068
MARISHA: It's a solid gate?

03:33:38.068 --> 03:33:42.397
ASHLY: Well, if she were to run out into the clear
area, you could use Frumpkin, as if Frumpkin was hunting.

03:33:42.397 --> 03:33:44.370
MARISHA: To pick her up. Helivac her out!

03:33:44.370 --> 03:33:47.223
LIAM: Possible.

03:33:47.223 --> 03:33:52.752
MARISHA: Owls eat mice. I'm just saying. It makes
sense in nature.

03:33:52.752 --> 03:33:56.435
LIAM: Could you make yourself a very distinct
looking mouse, like a shock of white hair on the

03:33:56.435 --> 03:34:00.191
mouse head or something like that? Something
unique?

03:34:00.191 --> 03:34:02.629
SUMALEE: So that your friend wouldn't mistake me.

03:34:02.629 --> 03:34:04.782
LIAM: Correct.

03:34:04.782 --> 03:34:10.100
SUMALEE: I think I can. A particular type of field
mouse.

03:34:10.100 --> 03:34:14.200
MATT: You can do that.

03:34:14.446 --> 03:34:17.478
SUMALEE: I just want to get close.

03:34:17.478 --> 03:34:24.057
ASHLY: Nila, do you promise that if you see your
son, you're not going to try anything on your own?

03:34:24.057 --> 03:34:31.907
SUMALEE: I know I won't succeed, so I won't. I
just want to get a look.

03:34:31.907 --> 03:34:35.470
LIAM: Send in the animals.

03:34:35.470 --> 03:34:40.792
MARISHA: We'll help you find your son. Keep it
together in there, all right?

03:34:40.792 --> 03:34:42.795
SUMALEE: I will.

03:34:42.795 --> 03:34:50.198
MARISHA: Now, here's the thing: goblin girl and
hobo wizard have this spell where they can talk

03:34:50.198 --> 03:34:58.945
into your ear. You probably won't be able to
respond back as a mouse except for maybe squeaks. Squeaks?

03:34:58.945 --> 03:35:02.968
SAM: How about one squeak is "yes," two squeaks is
"no."

03:35:02.968 --> 03:35:04.153
MARISHA: That's good.

03:35:04.153 --> 03:35:10.540
SAM: Three squeaks is, "My son's been compromised!
Please come rescue me! I'm dying in here! Please

03:35:10.540 --> 03:35:12.416
"come get me!"

03:35:12.416 --> 03:35:18.335
SUMALEE: Okay, one squeak: yes. Two squeaks: no.
Three squeaks--

03:35:18.335 --> 03:35:22.381
SAM: "Oh my god, everything's gone to shit!"

03:35:22.381 --> 03:35:27.373
LIAM: Would Comprehend Languages work with a
mouse, or no? That would be a different spell,

03:35:27.373 --> 03:35:29.469
right? Speak with Animals?

03:35:29.469 --> 03:35:33.928
MATT: Comprehend Languages has to be spoken
languages or written language.

03:35:33.928 --> 03:35:35.376
LIAM: I agree, yeah.

03:35:35.376 --> 03:35:41.902
SUMALEE: I'm not going to do three squeaks because
I'm going to hold it together and I will come out. Right?

03:35:41.902 --> 03:35:44.247
LIAM: Yeah, K.I.T. Keep it together.

03:35:44.247 --> 03:35:52.308
SAM: Absolutely. You are a strong, powerful
firbolg. Are you sure you don't know Pumat Sol?

03:35:52.308 --> 03:35:56.086
ASHLY: I knew you were going to say it! I knew it.
You were doing so well.

03:35:56.086 --> 03:35:57.397
SUMALEE: What is that?

03:35:57.397 --> 03:36:00.573
SAM: He's one of you. There's four of him.

03:36:00.573 --> 03:36:05.525
MARISHA: "He's one of you?" That's so generalizing
and demeaning.

03:36:05.525 --> 03:36:08.660
SAM: I mean, they're kind of all the same, right?

03:36:08.660 --> 03:36:10.546
ASHLY and MARISHA: No!

03:36:10.546 --> 03:36:14.321
SUMALEE: Now it's demeaning.

03:36:14.321 --> 03:36:19.518
MARISHA: Matt drowns the future comments.

03:36:19.518 --> 03:36:22.661
LIAM: You must know Jareth the Goblin King? You're
buddies with him?

03:36:22.661 --> 03:36:27.007
SAM: All goblins are different.

03:36:27.007 --> 03:36:29.842
MARISHA: Question, where this collection of
barrels--

03:36:29.842 --> 03:36:35.557
MATT: Green privilege. Go on.

03:36:35.557 --> 03:36:38.848
MARISHA: The collection of barrels. Are they on
the inside in the courtyard?

03:36:38.848 --> 03:36:40.332
MATT: They're inside the courtyard, yes.

03:36:40.332 --> 03:36:47.711
MARISHA: How about we use that barrel pile as your
meeting point? We'll make sure that Frumpkin's

03:36:47.711 --> 03:36:52.435
watching the barrel pile, and you get back there
when you're done scouting.

03:36:52.435 --> 03:36:56.358
SUMALEE: I'm up for it.

03:36:56.358 --> 03:37:04.964
MARISHA: You got this, and we're relying on you.
So, you know, don't fuck it up.

03:37:04.964 --> 03:37:07.847
SUMALEE: There is that word again. It has many
meanings.

03:37:07.847 --> 03:37:09.030
LIAM: Truth.

03:37:09.030 --> 03:37:15.281
MATT: Do you take your form, then?

03:37:15.281 --> 03:37:16.991
SUMALEE: Yes, I will take my form.

03:37:16.991 --> 03:37:18.789
MARISHA: Oh my god, this is so exciting!

03:37:18.789 --> 03:37:26.235
MATT: Nila's large firbolg physicality blinks down
to this tiny little field mouse. What

03:37:26.235 --> 03:37:29.446
characteristic of it do you want to stand out?

03:37:29.446 --> 03:37:31.161
MARISHA: I'm so happy.

03:37:31.161 --> 03:37:36.983
SUMALEE: The nice white stripe across the top,
from its head all the way down.

03:37:36.983 --> 03:37:46.610
MATT: It's like a skunk mouse. Like Stripe from
Gremlins. All right, there is Nila in mouse form.

03:37:46.610 --> 03:37:55.160
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, but we didn't talk about the first
part. Frumpkin's got to bring her in there. Buddy,

03:37:55.335 --> 03:38:01.706
don't eat, just carry her. Stay away from the two
on the top, okay? Put her by the barrels if you

03:38:01.946 --> 03:38:06.969
can. Then come back.

03:38:06.969 --> 03:38:15.868
MATT: Frumpkin moseys up to the edge of your
shoulder. Looks over towards her. Lands on the

03:38:15.868 --> 03:38:20.969
ground next to you, does a couple of hops up to
you.

03:38:20.969 --> 03:38:26.862
SUMALEE: I offer my neck to pick me up.

03:38:26.862 --> 03:38:33.980
MATT: For a brief moment you all inhale, and you
see the claws have wrapped around the mouse's

03:38:33.980 --> 03:38:47.569
body. Suddenly, you're soaring through the air, a
sensation you've never had before. As Frumpkin

03:38:47.569 --> 03:38:51.677
makes his way over into the trees, make a stealth
check for Frumpkin, please.

03:38:51.677 --> 03:38:59.575
LIAM: As he's going, I tell him: Correction, find
an out of the way place to sit and watch those

03:38:59.575 --> 03:39:00.996
barrels. Stealth, you say?

03:39:00.996 --> 03:39:01.572
MATT: Yes.

03:39:01.572 --> 03:39:04.136
LIAM: For my owl, so I have to go to the other
page. The owl page.

03:39:04.136 --> 03:39:05.289
MATT: Yes, you do.

03:39:05.289 --> 03:39:07.070
LIAM: Which I have ready.

03:39:07.070 --> 03:39:09.029
SAM: You have an owl page on D&D Beyond?

03:39:09.029 --> 03:39:10.060
LIAM: 13.

03:39:10.060 --> 03:39:12.125
ASHLY: That wonderful service?

03:39:12.125 --> 03:39:19.492
SAM: Oh god, the house is full of tabaxi!

03:39:19.492 --> 03:39:27.266
MARISHA: We sent in a laser pointer! Shit!

03:39:27.266 --> 03:39:36.486
MATT: It's the best use of Prestidigitation. Look
at the red light! As you're soaring through the

03:39:36.486 --> 03:39:43.419
boughs, the leaves and the branches soar past, the
wind past your face. You get that high view of

03:39:43.419 --> 03:39:52.744
down into the courtyard as suddenly you go into a
steep dive. Within a moment, you're lifted back up

03:39:52.744 --> 03:40:01.884
and then dropped onto the ground next to one of
the barrels. Frumpkin takes off. The guard glances

03:40:01.884 --> 03:40:06.960
over, and is going to take a shot.

03:40:06.960 --> 03:40:09.974
LIAM: Take your shot.

03:40:09.974 --> 03:40:14.819
MATT: Natural five! It's going to put it at a
nine. I'm pretty sure that doesn't hit.

03:40:14.819 --> 03:40:16.772
LIAM: Does not hit my owl.

03:40:16.772 --> 03:40:21.522
MATT: (arrow hissing) "Eh, shit," you hear
muttered over the side. Seems bored and wanted to

03:40:21.522 --> 03:40:24.348
shoot at something that looked interesting.

03:40:24.348 --> 03:40:29.382
LIAM: You hear beside you: <i>Arschloch.</i>

03:40:29.382 --> 03:40:33.729
MATT: There you are in the courtyard now.

03:40:33.729 --> 03:40:36.507
SUMALEE: I want to go toward--

03:40:36.507 --> 03:40:40.554
MARISHA: My terrible map of what I think based on
what he drew.

03:40:40.554 --> 03:40:45.993
MATT: It's not bad. Immediately glancing around,
make a perception check, actually, as you are

03:40:45.993 --> 03:40:47.636
coming into the courtyard.

03:40:47.636 --> 03:40:53.088
MARISHA: Were the porthole windows in the wall, or
in the actual building?

03:40:53.088 --> 03:40:55.694
MATT: They were in the wall of the second floor.

03:40:55.694 --> 03:40:56.741
LIAM: Of the building?

03:40:56.741 --> 03:40:58.888
MATT: Of the building, yes.

03:40:58.888 --> 03:41:01.824
SUMALEE: Shit! Six.

03:41:01.824 --> 03:41:07.777
MATT: It's hard to see any specific areas where
you can get in other than the main doors. There is

03:41:07.777 --> 03:41:12.376
a slight gap between the front door to the
entrance and the floor of the interior. Other than

03:41:12.376 --> 03:41:16.203
that, scooting around the exterior, it's the only
entrance you see.

03:41:16.203 --> 03:41:18.147
LIAM: P.O.V., two inches tall.

03:41:18.147 --> 03:41:24.184
MATT: Yep, right at the bottom. This is some Honey
I Shrunk the Kids shit now.

03:41:24.184 --> 03:41:30.723
SUMALEE: I should have talked to my friends before
to get a plan. Nila's a little confused again.

03:41:30.723 --> 03:41:36.044
MATT: You're looking at the building right there.
You can see the two guards going along the wall.

03:41:36.044 --> 03:41:39.540
You hear the sound of work being done on the carts
around the side, and all you see is that front

03:41:39.540 --> 03:41:43.011
door with that slight gap at the bottom. What are
you doing?

03:41:43.011 --> 03:41:45.684
SUMALEE: I think I want to go underneath the gap.

03:41:45.684 --> 03:41:50.913
MATT: Okay. You scoot, squeeze under, flattening
out your mouse body and making your way through on

03:41:50.913 --> 03:41:57.058
the inside. The immediate warmth hits you from the
cold exterior of the forest. The inside is, mostly

03:41:57.058 --> 03:42:01.706
being stone, comparatively, the temperature is
much warmer in here. Coming inside, it's still a

03:42:01.706 --> 03:42:05.133
flat stone floor. It's not very well decorated at
all.

03:42:05.133 --> 03:42:11.473
SAM: So judgy.

03:42:11.473 --> 03:42:14.543
SUMALEE: Field mouse is not looking at the
decoration.

03:42:14.543 --> 03:42:18.782
MATT: In the sense that comparatively to some
other places you've seen here, it's just plain,

03:42:18.782 --> 03:42:29.839
stone walls. It's very basic. It's <i>so</i> basic.
Looking inside, there is one curved stone

03:42:29.839 --> 03:42:35.771
staircase that leads up to the second floor. There
is a hall that goes to the left and further down

03:42:35.771 --> 03:42:43.059
to one side. There is a closed door that leads
into an interior chamber, and that's all you can

03:42:43.059 --> 03:42:47.560
see at the moment. The spiral staircase up, the
door ahead of you, and the hall that curves around

03:42:47.560 --> 03:42:49.751
the side.

03:42:49.751 --> 03:42:51.356
SAM: You know it's down.

03:42:51.356 --> 03:42:57.310
SUMALEE: It's down where my son could be. Sorry,
so I don't want to go up the spiral staircase.

03:42:57.310 --> 03:42:59.376
What are the other two options?

03:42:59.376 --> 03:43:01.454
SAM: Around to the side or a closed door.

03:43:01.454 --> 03:43:03.152
LIAM: This floor, upstairs or downstairs.

03:43:03.152 --> 03:43:04.781
SUMALEE: Downstairs.

03:43:04.781 --> 03:43:06.825
MARISHA: Do the spiral stairs go up and down?

03:43:06.825 --> 03:43:09.840
MATT: They only go up, yes.

03:43:09.840 --> 03:43:12.639
SUMALEE: I have to pick one of the two doors and
hope that it leads down.

03:43:12.639 --> 03:43:16.648
MATT: The door or the hallway, one of the two.

03:43:16.648 --> 03:43:20.363
SUMALEE: (sighs) I wish I had my smell pouch!

03:43:20.363 --> 03:43:22.893
(laughter)

03:43:22.893 --> 03:43:30.190
SUMALEE: I'll choose... the door.

03:43:30.446 --> 03:43:32.564
MARISHA: It's the game show host problem.

03:43:32.564 --> 03:43:42.839
MATT: You squeeze beneath the door and immediately
see a general mess room. There are a couple of

03:43:42.839 --> 03:43:53.000
tables and chairs that are pressed up against
them. The smell of alcohol and stale, dried meat

03:43:53.000 --> 03:44:00.429
hits your nose and you can see immediately,
sitting in two of the chairs, two members of The

03:44:00.429 --> 03:44:07.383
Iron Shepherds that are in the process of eating a
midday lunch. One of them is a small male

03:44:07.383 --> 03:44:18.966
halfling. He has a weaselly-looking face. He's in
the process of finishing what's comparatively to

03:44:18.966 --> 03:44:26.027
his size, a large tankard of ale, and eating some
sort of heavy starch biscuit meal. Across from

03:44:26.027 --> 03:44:33.330
him, on the other side of the table, you see a
human female barbarian with greasy curls of

03:44:33.330 --> 03:44:43.772
blondish hair that meet with her fur shoulder and
very tattered leathers for decoration. They're

03:44:43.772 --> 03:44:55.176
both drinking and eating. Catching off the side of
the ear, the halfling is seemingly

03:44:55.176 --> 03:45:05.145
mid-complaint about how, "You know, it really
ticks me off that we lost some good catches on the

03:45:05.145 --> 03:45:09.659
way up here. Boss shouldn't've been so careless
with that, but I mean, I'm not going to tell him

03:45:09.659 --> 03:45:15.907
that. You know, it's frustrating." The women
finishes a bite and a big swig of her glass.

03:45:15.907 --> 03:45:22.505
"Yeah, well, you got to break some eggs,
sometimes." Like she's making some big

03:45:22.505 --> 03:45:31.507
pontification, some big statement. He goes, "Wise
words," and keeps drinking and they go into a

03:45:31.507 --> 03:45:35.678
quiet state, but there's two of them now present.
You do know that at least they've returned and

03:45:35.678 --> 03:45:40.480
there are some present inside. It does not appear
that there's any other entrance downward. There's

03:45:40.480 --> 03:45:43.457
a secondary door on the opposite end.

03:45:43.457 --> 03:45:45.165
SUMALEE: Go to the secondary door.

03:45:45.165 --> 03:45:46.444
MATT: Make a stealth check.

03:45:46.444 --> 03:45:51.113
MARISHA: Come on, mouse. Come on, mousey-poo. Oh!
That's good!

03:45:51.113 --> 03:45:52.853
SUMALEE: 17.

03:45:52.853 --> 03:45:55.365
LIAM: Squeakers!

03:45:55.365 --> 03:46:01.218
MATT: Okay. You dart around the side, beneath a
table, beneath a bench, and around the edge. None

03:46:01.218 --> 03:46:06.664
the wiser of your presence. They give no shits.
You make your way and squeeze past the door on the

03:46:06.753 --> 03:46:19.064
opposite end. There you come to a suiting room.
There are weapons that are hung up on racks. There

03:46:19.064 --> 03:46:26.412
are a couple of small wooden poles with dowels in
the sides that are meant to hold armor, shields

03:46:26.412 --> 03:46:30.605
and things that are there, additional crossbows
and things that the guards probably utilize at

03:46:30.605 --> 03:46:38.321
different points. This is an equipment storage
room. There is another door to the left. Where you

03:46:38.321 --> 03:46:41.902
entered and squeezed underneath, there is a door
to the left that you can go under as well. As you

03:46:41.902 --> 03:46:50.588
leave and pass that room, you head to a back
hallway to this interior part of this level. This

03:46:50.588 --> 03:46:56.414
hallway continues down and seems to meet the hall
that continued around the left side, and then

03:46:56.414 --> 03:47:03.397
continues on. To the right, there is another door
that leads into another chamber.

03:47:03.397 --> 03:47:13.425
SUMALEE: Got to do it. Down the hall to the right
chamber. This now I know that I didn't have to go

03:47:13.425 --> 03:47:18.239
down that other hallway, the first one, because
that's already met up here, right?

03:47:18.239 --> 03:47:21.321
MATT: The other hallway would have continued this
way, and the hallway you're just emerging now,

03:47:21.321 --> 03:47:25.153
meets with it. Then on that right side of it,
there is a door that leads into whatever room is

03:47:25.153 --> 03:47:32.745
the next one over from that mess hall chamber. You
head into that room? Heading down that room, it's

03:47:32.745 --> 03:47:39.346
a small closet-like room, and there is a trapdoor
on the ground.

03:47:39.346 --> 03:47:42.659
SUMALEE: That's it, but how do I open the trapdoor
now?

03:47:42.659 --> 03:47:45.823
SAM: Maybe there's a little crack or something.

03:47:45.823 --> 03:47:57.937
SUMALEE: That's what I think is my way downstairs,
so I go toward the trapdoor, see if I can't get in.

03:47:57.937 --> 03:48:01.559
MATT: Make a strength check in your mouse form.

03:48:01.559 --> 03:48:06.669
MARISHA: Try and squeeze under? This is when a
natural 20 is-- aw.

03:48:06.669 --> 03:48:09.060
SUMALEE: Nine, that's a nine.

03:48:09.060 --> 03:48:17.738
MATT: Yeah, no. I'll put that at a minus four.
Your mouse isn't strong enough to budge the door

03:48:17.738 --> 03:48:19.501
that is currently--

03:48:19.501 --> 03:48:23.343
MARISHA: There might be a hole in the floor or
something else.

03:48:23.343 --> 03:48:27.738
SUMALEE: I feel like that's the key, but I want to
keep looking to see how many Iron Shepherds there

03:48:27.738 --> 03:48:33.487
may be in any other location that I haven't
explored.

03:48:33.487 --> 03:48:38.747
MATT: Okay, make a perception check.

03:48:38.747 --> 03:48:42.576
SUMALEE: 14.

03:48:42.576 --> 03:48:55.250
MATT: As you're pushing against the door, you do
hear voices muffled from below. Then you hear what

03:48:55.250 --> 03:48:58.466
sounds like a laugh, a deep billowing laugh.

03:48:58.466 --> 03:48:59.994
SUMALEE: Can I gnaw my way through the door?

03:48:59.994 --> 03:49:05.749
MATT: You can! And in a few days, you'll probably
make your way through.

03:49:05.749 --> 03:49:09.157
SUMALEE: I hear a laugh. Oh, have I heard this
laugh before?

03:49:09.157 --> 03:49:12.228
MATT: You have.

03:49:12.228 --> 03:49:23.247
SUMALEE: Shit. This is enough for me, I know
they're down there. The leader of the Iron

03:49:23.247 --> 03:49:39.720
Shepherds is down there beneath that trapdoor.
That's what I believe. I don't know what to do now.

03:49:39.720 --> 03:49:41.656
ASHLY: Can you guys talk to her?

03:49:41.656 --> 03:49:43.398
SAM: We can send a Message.

03:49:43.398 --> 03:49:44.673
LIAM: After a while, yeah.

03:49:44.673 --> 03:49:47.917
SAM: I'll send a Message saying: Are you still
alive?

03:49:47.917 --> 03:49:49.748
SUMALEE: (squeaks)

03:49:49.748 --> 03:49:52.497
SAM: She's still alive.

03:49:52.497 --> 03:49:58.667
MATT: Sumalee, what are you going to do?

03:49:59.439 --> 03:50:08.075
SUMALEE: I am going to stick to my mission to
scout. I am going to pull everything I have to go

03:50:08.075 --> 03:50:14.240
away from the trap door, knowing where it is, and
I am going to scurry up and I want to explore that

03:50:14.240 --> 03:50:17.904
spiral staircase.

03:50:17.904 --> 03:50:22.315
MATT: You're heading back into the cross-hallway.
Are you following down the hall or are you heading

03:50:22.315 --> 03:50:25.665
back through the mess room?

03:50:25.665 --> 03:50:27.112
SUMALEE: I'll go the hallway this time.

03:50:27.112 --> 03:50:30.735
MATT: Okay, you scurry around the hallway. There
is nobody in there, so there is no one you are

03:50:30.735 --> 03:50:35.158
trying to hide from. You make it back to the main
entryway, head to the staircase, and it takes you

03:50:35.158 --> 03:50:39.836
awhile to get up there, because the steps are
about that high each. It's a little jump, and then

03:50:39.836 --> 03:50:47.484
you miss a few and have to stop and skitter back
up. It takes you awhile, the better part of about

03:50:47.484 --> 03:50:56.746
20 to 25 minutes. You eventually make your way to
the second floor. Up there, you can see another

03:50:56.746 --> 03:51:03.821
hallway and as opposed to the bottom floor, which
had an L-shaped hallway that went around, this one

03:51:03.821 --> 03:51:10.656
has a perimeter hall. There are those porthole
windows that are carved into the stone, two on

03:51:10.656 --> 03:51:17.397
each side. As you come up to the top, the hall
goes around and there's a central chamber on the

03:51:17.397 --> 03:51:26.337
inside, or chambers if they're divided. You can
see immediately on the second floor, a door

03:51:26.337 --> 03:51:32.747
directly available to the one that's just north of
you. You don't see any other door on this

03:51:32.747 --> 03:51:35.901
particular corridor.

03:51:35.901 --> 03:51:38.410
SUMALEE: All right, let's crawl under that door.

03:51:38.410 --> 03:51:45.268
MATT: You scoot beneath that door and inside
there, you can see a number of beds. You see four

03:51:45.533 --> 03:51:54.170
different beds that are lined up. You also find a
familiar smell: other mice. Specifically, the

03:51:54.170 --> 03:51:55.430
urine of other mice.

03:51:55.430 --> 03:51:57.540
SAM: Ugh.

03:51:57.540 --> 03:52:04.101
MATT: You glance over and in the corner you can
see one of the comforters that has been partially

03:52:04.101 --> 03:52:11.591
eaten and pulled down and tugged. There is a
slight hole in the stone on the edge. You can

03:52:11.591 --> 03:52:14.522
distinctly smell that there are other mice that
live in this space.

03:52:14.522 --> 03:52:16.416
SUMALEE: Is there anyone in the beds?

03:52:16.416 --> 03:52:19.797
MATT: You don't necessarily know if they are in
the beds at all-- There's nobody in the beds.

03:52:19.797 --> 03:52:23.107
Sorry. Yeah, nobody on the beds.

03:52:23.107 --> 03:52:25.781
SUMALEE: No people to be seen anywhere?

03:52:25.781 --> 03:52:28.689
MATT: No, not in this room.

03:52:28.689 --> 03:52:40.139
SUMALEE: Okay. What else can I cover? I want to
cover everything and gather as much of the layout.

03:52:40.139 --> 03:52:45.937
MATT: We'll say as you move into one of the other
rooms, the next two, you do notice that there are

03:52:45.937 --> 03:52:49.424
two other chambers. This upper floor is divided
into three different chambers. There is the wide

03:52:49.424 --> 03:52:51.695
one that has the four beds, there's one that has
two other beds, and there's one that has a

03:52:51.695 --> 03:52:56.852
singular large bed. This one room is almost like a
master bedroom. You gather this is probably the

03:52:56.852 --> 03:53:06.922
room that Lorenzo sleeps in. It's a wider bed. It
has, of all the other middling elements of

03:53:06.922 --> 03:53:14.091
comfort, this one comparatively is more extravagant,
more comfortable. The layers of cushions--

03:53:14.091 --> 03:53:17.930
SAM: A Dwendalian king.

03:53:17.930 --> 03:53:25.252
MATT: Goddamn it, Sam. Make a perception check.

03:53:28.765 --> 03:53:31.445
SUMALEE: Good. 19.

03:53:34.265 --> 03:53:36.471
SAM: Semen stains.

03:53:36.955 --> 03:53:41.023
(laughter)

03:53:41.023 --> 03:53:44.257
SAM: Everywhere!

03:53:44.257 --> 03:53:46.268
SUMALEE: That's what the mice are eating.

03:53:46.268 --> 03:53:57.261
MATT: You look up and there is a makeshift table
on the side of the bed, and a stone platter that

03:53:57.261 --> 03:54:08.551
sits on there, and the remains of a meal. The
smell in here is old and slightly decayed, like

03:54:08.551 --> 03:54:20.034
something had died. You glance up and you can see
some a bit of graying flesh and a faint glisten of white.

03:54:20.034 --> 03:54:29.231
SUMALEE: Oh, god. I want to explore. I want to get
closer.

03:54:29.231 --> 03:54:32.368
MATT: Okay. There is an edge of the bed that you
can eventually scurry up and use that to climb up

03:54:32.368 --> 03:54:38.884
onto the bed itself. The bed is bowed pretty
heavy. The actual bed was wide; whatever weight

03:54:38.884 --> 03:54:45.773
it's carried from Lorenzo is sunken rather deep in
there. It's a bit of a pit as you crawl across it,

03:54:45.773 --> 03:54:50.496
the blankets tossed and folded over. You make your
way to the edge and look over to this platter and

03:54:50.496 --> 03:55:02.284
what you see appears to be bones. Bones that are
covered in strips and elements of leftover meat.

03:55:02.284 --> 03:55:04.028
SUMALEE: Do I know what kind of meat?

03:55:04.028 --> 03:55:07.819
MATT: There is a skull. A tiny skull.

03:55:07.819 --> 03:55:12.238
SAM: Oh boy. That's not good.

03:55:12.238 --> 03:55:14.360
SUMALEE: An animal?

03:55:14.360 --> 03:55:18.777
MATT: Not animal.

03:55:22.455 --> 03:55:29.833
SUMALEE: I'm almost about to squeak three times
but I'm going to hold it together. I want to get

03:55:29.833 --> 03:55:32.787
out now.

03:55:32.787 --> 03:55:39.907
MATT: You make your way down off the side of the
bed and into the hallway and begin to turn around

03:55:39.907 --> 03:55:46.451
towards the staircase down. As you begin to
descend the staircase, you hear heavy footsteps

03:55:46.451 --> 03:55:52.555
making their way towards the base of the stairs.
(thumping sounds) You hear the shifting of

03:55:52.555 --> 03:56:08.592
leather. Make a stealth check... with the mouse's
dexterity which--

03:56:08.592 --> 03:56:14.428
SUMALEE: Oh right. Oh, that's probably better with
the mouse than with Nila.

03:56:14.428 --> 03:56:15.455
MATT: What did you roll?

03:56:15.455 --> 03:56:16.672
SUMALEE: Seven.

03:56:16.672 --> 03:56:17.987
SAM: You've got luck.

03:56:17.987 --> 03:56:21.612
SUMALEE: Oh yes, thank you! Luck! Thank you!

03:56:21.612 --> 03:56:23.691
MATT: Go ahead. Use that luck point.

03:56:23.691 --> 03:56:29.298
SUMALEE: Using my luck point. All right come on.
20!

03:56:29.298 --> 03:56:33.523
(cheering)

03:56:33.523 --> 03:56:41.419
SUMALEE: Thank you, Sam! It's allowed!

03:56:41.419 --> 03:56:45.728
MATT: Oh yeah, no, I know! I'm so thankful
because, as you come down the staircase, you see,

03:56:45.728 --> 03:57:00.554
looming up, towards the muscled form of a tired,
but intent to peruse his domain, Lorenzo, making

03:57:00.554 --> 03:57:09.377
his way up the same staircase. No glaive in his
hands. As you step up, you manage to wait for the

03:57:09.377 --> 03:57:14.629
right moment, hiding in the shadow of the step. As
his legs cross over, you dart down to make your

03:57:14.629 --> 03:57:21.758
way, and he doesn't see a thing. You make your way
back down into the main entryway to this, back out

03:57:21.758 --> 03:57:28.057
under the main entrance under the door. You are
now in the courtyard. You head on over to the barrels.

03:57:28.057 --> 03:57:33.803
SUMALEE: Yes! Squeak, squeak, squeak! Come get
me!

03:57:33.803 --> 03:57:42.419
MATT: Frumpkin has kept watch, specifically sees
the mouse return. Darts down and snatches you up

03:57:42.419 --> 03:57:50.949
in your form and swoops up. Make a stealth check
for Frumpkin. The same guard is getting slightly--

03:57:50.949 --> 03:57:53.021
LIAM: That's a 17.

03:57:53.021 --> 03:57:58.751
MATT: 17. He glances over and sees Frumpkin dart
down and goes "I got ya."

03:57:58.751 --> 03:58:00.510
SAM: Oh no!

03:58:00.510 --> 03:58:03.555
MATT: However, still--I mean good for you!

03:58:03.555 --> 03:58:06.177
SUMALEE: Good for Nila!

03:58:06.177 --> 03:58:15.565
MATT: Still a natural two. Another bolt goes off.
Frumpkin goes up into the trees, back down to you

03:58:15.565 --> 03:58:20.855
guys. They are waiting patiently, watching as the
owl returns and on the ground releases the mouse

03:58:20.855 --> 03:58:22.871
form of Nila.

03:58:22.871 --> 03:58:28.883
MARISHA: (clapping) Awesome! What did you learn?

03:58:28.883 --> 03:58:30.978
MATT: She is still a mouse.

03:58:30.978 --> 03:58:32.351
ASHLY: Can she become not a mouse?

03:58:32.351 --> 03:58:33.416
MATT: If she wants to.

03:58:33.416 --> 03:58:36.249
SUMALEE: Yes, I would like to shift out of my
mouse form.

03:58:36.249 --> 03:58:37.806
MATT: Okay.

03:58:37.806 --> 03:58:40.120
SAM: Tell us everything!

03:58:40.120 --> 03:58:41.454
MARISHA: That was awesome!

03:58:41.454 --> 03:58:43.170
LIAM: What was?

03:58:43.170 --> 03:58:46.955
MARISHA: She didn't die as a mouse.

03:58:46.955 --> 03:58:47.979
LIAM: That's true.

03:58:47.979 --> 03:58:52.592
MARISHA: She turned into a mouse and then came
back and was helped back out by your bird-cat!

03:58:52.592 --> 03:58:55.029
That's awesome!

03:58:55.029 --> 03:58:57.629
LIAM: Did you learn anything?

03:58:57.629 --> 03:59:15.250
SUMALEE: I did. It's terrible. I don't know if I
saw my son. I know where they are keeping people.

03:59:15.250 --> 03:59:22.961
I know where they are keeping their prisoners.
There is a trap door. You can get through it,

03:59:22.961 --> 03:59:37.176
through a mess hall and through another room and a
hallway. There are two Iron Shepherds eating in

03:59:37.176 --> 03:59:43.526
the mess hall. There are, I think, many under the
trap door.

03:59:43.526 --> 03:59:45.806
LIAM: Many?

03:59:45.806 --> 03:59:58.264
SUMALEE: Well, I saw beds. I saw six beds, plus a
big bed. The big bed belongs to the leader.

03:59:58.264 --> 04:00:03.238
ASHLY: What do you mean you don't know if you saw
your son?

04:00:03.238 --> 04:00:19.527
SUMALEE: He was eating something. I don't think it
was him, but it looked like he was eating--

04:00:19.527 --> 04:00:22.001
LIAM: One of these in the mess hall?

04:00:22.001 --> 04:00:32.706
SUMALEE: No, just the leader that was eating
something that didn't look like an animal. It

04:00:32.706 --> 04:00:35.145
looked small.

04:00:35.145 --> 04:00:37.259
ASHLY: Jesus Christ.

04:00:37.259 --> 04:00:41.557
SUMALEE: Like my son's size.

04:00:41.798 --> 04:00:45.034
LIAM: How many people? You said two?

04:00:45.034 --> 04:00:52.542
SUMALEE: There were six or seven beds, and I heard
voices under the trap door. I know they're there.

04:00:52.542 --> 04:00:58.875
My son is not dead. He is there underneath the
trap door.

04:00:58.875 --> 04:01:05.044
LIAM: I pull some paper out and say, "Can you draw
these rooms?"

04:01:05.044 --> 04:01:07.827
SUMALEE: Yes, I will do my best.

04:01:07.827 --> 04:01:10.548
MATT: I'll have an actual sketch for you next
time.

04:01:10.548 --> 04:01:11.501
SUMALEE: Thank you!

04:01:11.501 --> 04:01:13.550
LIAM: That's cool.

04:01:13.550 --> 04:01:21.243
MARISHA: We know that there are members of The
Iron Shepherds here, and we know they have beds

04:01:21.243 --> 04:01:24.873
here. Wait until the fall of night?

04:01:24.873 --> 04:01:26.631
LIAM: Yeah.

04:01:26.631 --> 04:01:31.213
MARISHA: Take out the guards, kill them in their
sleep?

04:01:31.213 --> 04:01:36.629
SAM: I still would like some help, maybe one extra
hand.

04:01:36.629 --> 04:01:38.951
ASHLY: How much time do we have until nightfall?

04:01:38.951 --> 04:01:45.052
MATT: Until nightfall? I'd say with the two-hours
travel from the morning, you'd have probably

04:01:45.052 --> 04:01:47.131
another six seven hours.

04:01:47.131 --> 04:01:50.123
MARISHA: How long is it to travel to get back to
town?

04:01:50.123 --> 04:01:54.709
MATT: If you are heading straight south to the
town, it's maybe another hour. Well, actually a

04:01:54.709 --> 04:01:57.628
little less than that.

04:01:57.628 --> 04:01:59.299
MARISHA: Not as far as I thought.

04:01:59.299 --> 04:02:05.802
SUMALEE: I wish I knew if there was another
entrance or exit underneath that trap door. I

04:02:05.802 --> 04:02:15.379
couldn't get in, but I heard the voices and I
heard many people under there.

04:02:15.379 --> 04:02:19.862
MARISHA: If I know anything from my time in the
criminal underworld, it's these people always have

04:02:19.862 --> 04:02:24.204
secret passageways in and out. We could do like a
wide walk of the perimeter, see if we find

04:02:24.204 --> 04:02:29.375
anything out-of-place in the forest. See if
there's a path, and if we don't find anything,

04:02:29.375 --> 04:02:32.619
make our way back into town. Look for a hired
hand.

04:02:32.619 --> 04:02:38.460
LIAM: Well, I like the idea of an extra hand or
two to back us up, but I also agree with you. We

04:02:38.460 --> 04:02:45.861
go in at night and try to take the guards out, who are
watching quietly, hopefully. If that is the case,

04:02:45.861 --> 04:02:52.290
we can go in and get our friends, and if we do
that successfully, then we can burn these ones in

04:02:52.388 --> 04:02:55.572
their sleep.

04:02:55.572 --> 04:02:59.075
MARISHA: Again with the burning thing.

04:02:59.075 --> 04:03:02.415
LIAM: Write what you know.

04:03:02.415 --> 04:03:07.324
MARISHA: So. Let's search around and see if we can
search the woods.

04:03:07.324 --> 04:03:08.744
SAM: Do a perimeter check?

04:03:08.744 --> 04:03:09.771
MARISHA: Perimeter check.

04:03:09.771 --> 04:03:12.402
SAM: Looking for secret entrances!

04:03:12.402 --> 04:03:15.398
MATT: All right. I will need both stealth checks
from all of you.

04:03:15.398 --> 04:03:17.492
MARISHA: Super stealth.

04:03:17.492 --> 04:03:20.322
SAM: Stealthy searching!

04:03:20.322 --> 04:03:21.837
ASHLY: I'm at disadvantage?

04:03:21.837 --> 04:03:25.246
MATT: You're disadvantaged with your stealth
check.

04:03:25.246 --> 04:03:30.996
ASHLY: Well, I got a one, so there's not going to
get much worse than that.

04:03:36.818 --> 04:03:44.166
MATT: As you are having this discussion, what you
can only amount to be like a large pile of pots

04:03:44.166 --> 04:03:51.260
being dropped onto the ground, Keg gets her foot
caught right underneath a nearby tree root and

04:03:51.260 --> 04:03:58.502
just (crashing sound effect) onto the ground.
Glancing over, you immediately see that one guard

04:03:58.502 --> 04:04:02.329
that was shooting at Frumpkin go like, "Hey, hey
hey hey!"

04:04:02.329 --> 04:04:03.526
SAM: (whispering) Hey, let's run back to town.

04:04:03.526 --> 04:04:06.665
MARISHA: Run! Yeah run! We run back to town. Fuck
the perimeter search.

04:04:06.665 --> 04:04:09.330
MATT: Heading southward to town or, where are you
doing?

04:04:09.330 --> 04:04:11.005
SAM: Southward to town.

04:04:11.005 --> 04:04:13.660
MARISHA: Away directly from the building.

04:04:13.660 --> 04:04:18.084
MATT: All right, and you guys go running as fast
as you can towards town.

04:04:18.084 --> 04:04:19.661
ASHLY: Sorry sorry sorry!

04:04:19.661 --> 04:04:21.654
(laughter)

04:04:21.654 --> 04:04:31.585
MATT: Charging through the Savalierwood to find
what hopeful aid or fortune you can. And that's

04:04:31.585 --> 04:04:33.909
where we will end tonight's session.

04:04:33.909 --> 04:04:34.861
LIAM: Good game.

04:04:34.861 --> 04:04:35.919
MARISHA: Great game!

04:04:35.919 --> 04:04:37.229
MATT: Well done, guys.

04:04:37.229 --> 04:04:38.817
SUMALEE: I didn't have it in me anymore to do any
more.

04:04:38.817 --> 04:04:40.602
(laughter)

04:04:40.602 --> 04:04:43.163
SUMALEE: I've already seen such scaring things!

04:04:43.163 --> 04:04:50.763
MATT: All right. We will pick up on that next
Thursday, with both Sumalee and Ashly.

04:04:50.763 --> 04:04:53.328
ASHLY: Look who's here!

04:04:53.328 --> 04:04:54.804
SAM: Look at this guy!

04:04:54.804 --> 04:04:57.151
TALIESIN: Goddamn it, you people! Hi!

04:04:57.151 --> 04:04:59.578
SAM: I'm Taliesin Jaffe.

04:04:59.578 --> 04:05:03.400
MARISHA: How was it from the lobby?

04:05:03.400 --> 04:05:09.744
TALIESIN: It was about ten seconds behind, mostly.
Hi guys.

04:05:09.744 --> 04:05:13.243
SAM: Were you the little boy being eaten?

04:05:13.243 --> 04:05:18.500
TALIESIN: I was, in fact, the bear. Thank you to
all those that guessed. I was the bear.

04:05:18.500 --> 04:05:21.093
MATT: Missed an opportunity.

04:05:21.093 --> 04:05:24.337
TALIESIN: Ah not yet, not yet! Ugh! Okay.

04:05:24.337 --> 04:05:26.579
MATT and TALIESIN: Maybe next week.

04:05:26.579 --> 04:05:29.492
MATT: Anyway, thank you guys! Amazing job!
Sumalee, amazing!

04:05:29.492 --> 04:05:32.085
(cheering)

04:05:32.085 --> 04:05:34.410
MARISHA: Yes, Nila!

04:05:34.410 --> 04:05:38.167
MATT: Thank you guys for coming along with us. For
those of you who we will see at Comic-Con, we will

04:05:38.167 --> 04:05:42.908
see you there! If not, you will see our panel on
Tuesday in place of Talks Machina, so you can get

04:05:42.908 --> 04:05:47.182
caught up. In the meantime, just know that we love
you. Have a wonderful weekend, and is it Thursday
