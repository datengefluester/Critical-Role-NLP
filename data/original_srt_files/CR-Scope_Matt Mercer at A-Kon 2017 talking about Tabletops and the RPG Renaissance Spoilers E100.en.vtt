NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:12.598
[dramatic music]

00:00:12.598 --> 00:00:30.184
(cheering)

00:00:30.184 --> 00:00:34.960
MATT: Okay, that was a lot.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.797
(laughter)

00:00:37.797 --> 00:00:41.216
MATT: Wow. And they're still coming in! Okay.

00:00:41.216 --> 00:00:43.377
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Roll for composure!

00:00:43.377 --> 00:00:45.671
MATT: Oh, that was a one, my friend.

00:00:45.671 --> 00:00:47.798
(laughter)

00:00:47.798 --> 00:00:52.950
MATT: But that's usual for me. I have disadvantage
on most composure rolls. (laughs) Or social

00:00:52.950 --> 00:01:00.496
interaction. Anyway. Oh, they're still coming in.
I guess we'll patiently wait and quietly stare as

00:01:00.496 --> 00:01:01.744
everyone enters.

00:01:01.744 --> 00:01:03.375
(laughter)

00:01:03.375 --> 00:01:05.066
AUDIENCE MEMBER: As everybody turns to look.

00:01:05.132 --> 00:01:14.688
(laughter)

00:01:14.688 --> 00:01:16.187
MATT: Find your seats.

00:01:16.187 --> 00:01:21.830
(laughter)

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.146
MATT: Good job.

00:01:23.146 --> 00:01:26.166
(laughter)

00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:34.627
MATT: We still coming? We still got more line?
Yeah, we do. Okay.

00:01:34.627 --> 00:01:48.676
(cheering, chatter)

00:01:48.676 --> 00:01:53.787
MODERATOR: Hey, guys, we have a lot of people in
here, so after the panel today, he's not going to

00:01:53.787 --> 00:01:57.846
be able to stay and do any autographs. You guys
can see him tomorrow, I believe?

00:01:57.846 --> 00:02:01.145
MATT: Yes. I have... tomorrow... at a time.

00:02:01.145 --> 00:02:02.378
AUDIENCE: 2:30!

00:02:02.378 --> 00:02:03.369
MATT: That one.

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.428
MODERATOR: 2:30. His autograph session will be
tomorrow at 2:30, so we've got to get you guys as

00:02:08.428 --> 00:02:12.318
quickly out as possible, and, guys, enjoy.

00:02:12.318 --> 00:02:22.316
(cheering)

00:02:22.382 --> 00:02:28.499
MATT: So welcome, everyone, to a panel titled
"Critical Role, RPGs, and Tabletop Renaissance".

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:34.155
Thank you so much for coming. My name is Matthew
Mercer. I'm a voice actor from Los Angeles and--

00:02:34.155 --> 00:02:39.105
(cheering)

00:02:39.105 --> 00:02:42.678
MATT: --and I appreciate that I can tell the
Keyleth cosplays from the antlers in the audience.

00:02:42.678 --> 00:02:51.557
(laughs) Yes! But yeah, I also am Dungeon Master
for a show called Critical Role. Who here--

00:02:51.557 --> 00:02:56.587
(cheering)

00:02:56.587 --> 00:03:00.566
MATT: Raise your hand if you don't know what
Critical Role is. Oh, you're going to be really

00:03:00.566 --> 00:03:07.857
confused. Let's try and do this. So. Critical Role
is a Twitch stream that began two years ago, where

00:03:07.857 --> 00:03:11.760
I run a bunch of other friends of mine, who are
also voice actors, through a game of Dungeons

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:18.635
and Dragons weekly. Mostly weekly. As often as we
can. Sometimes you've got to take breaks, or we'll

00:03:18.635 --> 00:03:27.130
die. But yeah, so that's generally it. We're just
playing Dungeons and Dragons, and it was something

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:33.777
we thought might be cool when we were asked to do it,
and a lot of people happened to also want to watch.

00:03:33.777 --> 00:03:37.457
(cheering)

00:03:37.457 --> 00:03:41.267
MATT: And not just watch, but play their own
adventures. That's kind of the cool thing.

00:03:41.267 --> 00:03:43.443
(cheering)

00:03:43.443 --> 00:03:47.083
MATT: I will say, and I've had a lot of
conversations about this, in like interviews or

00:03:47.083 --> 00:03:55.283
philosophical discussions with Matt Colville or
Perkins and different people about what it is about D&amp;D and

00:03:55.283 --> 00:04:01.009
tabletop streaming that makes it so interesting.
For me, there's not a lot of media out there that

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:07.354
empowers the viewer when they're inspired to go
ahead and do the same thing immediately. You know,

00:04:07.354 --> 00:04:11.259
you can grow up watching films and cartoons and be
like, "I want to do that," and you can, you just

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:15.673
have to go to school for many, many years, and
then build up a resume and try and make work for

00:04:15.673 --> 00:04:19.832
it, and spend countless hours trying to work on an
independent project yourself, and that's really

00:04:19.832 --> 00:04:25.102
cool, but I'd say it's a big investment to get
there. Tabletop roleplaying, if you watch it and

00:04:25.102 --> 00:04:29.484
you're inspired to do it, you can buy a book
tomorrow, get some friends together, and have the

00:04:29.484 --> 00:04:33.623
same exact experience in your own living room.
Nothing excites me more than going and seeing

00:04:33.623 --> 00:04:39.342
people who either hadn't played in ten, 15 years
who then would message us on Twitter with pictures

00:04:39.342 --> 00:04:43.443
of their game group that they just got together
for the first time in who knows how long, or

00:04:43.443 --> 00:04:46.843
families that are playing D&amp;D together on the
weekends, now. It's become their family game night

00:04:46.843 --> 00:04:52.333
and a wonderful bonding experience for them. Or a
bunch of younger teens who missed the whole RPG

00:04:52.333 --> 00:04:57.454
generation and never had really an opportunity to
see how to play an RPG and how thrilling and

00:04:57.454 --> 00:05:02.121
wonderful it can be, learned through all these
different streams online that, "Oh, I can totally

00:05:02.121 --> 00:05:07.482
"do that!" And then go and do so. So I'm really
excited and proud and overwhelmed of the response

00:05:07.482 --> 00:05:16.000
to ours, let alone the entire community of
wonderful RPG streamers out there. So I'm excited

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.844
and I'm standing now in front of a room of people
who are here for that reason, and that blows my mind.

00:05:20.854 --> 00:05:28.068
(cheering)

00:05:28.443 --> 00:05:32.956
MATT: So. As a heads-up, too, we're going to do
our best to not spoil anything tonight, so when we

00:05:32.956 --> 00:05:37.684
get to a Q&amp;A portion tonight, let's try and be
respectful of people that aren't caught up,

00:05:37.684 --> 00:05:45.752
especially some revelations in the most recent
100th episode. Try our best. Which, by the way,

00:05:45.752 --> 00:05:47.135
100 episodes. What?!

00:05:47.135 --> 00:05:51.400
(cheering)

00:05:51.400 --> 00:06:01.981
MATT: That's crazy! Man. Like, if you guys aren't
sick of me by now, I guess at this point we're

00:06:01.981 --> 00:06:09.549
cool, then. Because, you guys, that's a lot of time
looking at my face. Even Marisha's like, "I've got

00:06:09.549 --> 00:06:19.395
"to take a break," so you guys... well done. Oh,
you too. So yeah, no. It's been a wild ride. I owe

00:06:19.395 --> 00:06:28.544
so much to roleplaying games, both JRPG, video
game RPGs, and tabletop roleplaying games. They're

00:06:28.544 --> 00:06:32.849
the type of storytelling that let me know who I
want to be, you know? Through sitting with books,

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:38.827
growing up reading fantasy novels and fiction
novels based in sci-fi universes: Arthur C.

00:06:38.827 --> 00:06:47.357
Clarke, Isaac Asimov, Piers Anthony, Tolkien. I
was raised by stories and other storytellers. It's

00:06:47.357 --> 00:06:52.679
those heroic stories, trials and tribulations and
battling against adversity and knowing what's

00:06:52.679 --> 00:06:57.727
right for you in standing up for that in the face
of people telling you otherwise. Those are the

00:06:57.727 --> 00:07:02.724
stories that teach us that it's important to rise
up to protect yourself, to protect your friends

00:07:02.724 --> 00:07:07.805
and the ideals, philosophies, and notions that you
hold dear to yourself, while also being open to

00:07:07.805 --> 00:07:14.751
conversation about different ideas. There's this
very heavily entrenched idea-- in modern culture

00:07:14.751 --> 00:07:20.172
especially-- modern political culture, just
general culture, that if you have different ideas

00:07:20.172 --> 00:07:27.701
to the other person, you can't talk about it. We
disagree, therefore there is no conversation. And

00:07:27.701 --> 00:07:32.479
I think that doesn't get us anywhere, and I think
a lot of these stories, a lot of these tales that

00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:36.841
many of us create ourselves or grew up watching,
whether it be film or television, cartoon, teach

00:07:36.841 --> 00:07:41.207
us different perspectives and that each person,
while they may disagree on certain things, what's

00:07:41.207 --> 00:07:45.082
honest and truth to you-- if anything is different
from the truth of them doesn't mean that it's

00:07:45.082 --> 00:07:49.829
necessarily right or wrong. It's that conversation
that you have to have to come to an understanding

00:07:49.829 --> 00:07:55.704
and realize you really don't have that much
different. Whether it be religion-based, whether

00:07:55.704 --> 00:08:01.869
it be cultural-based, whether it be interests,
where you grew up, where you live now, where your

00:08:01.869 --> 00:08:08.057
family's from. Any of that, you know? Whether it
be skin tone, sexuality. All of that is all just

00:08:08.057 --> 00:08:13.413
human beings trying to find happiness, and the
basis of everything that we do on a day-to-day

00:08:13.413 --> 00:08:19.769
basis, we're just trying to be happy and make
others happy. And to me storytelling is one of the

00:08:19.769 --> 00:08:26.160
most positive and inspirational ways that you can
bring people together regardless of your past and

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:32.540
walks of life, and become closer friends and enjoy
each other's company and become more empathic to

00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:37.451
each other, and learn more about other
perspectives in life. It's a wonderful, healthy

00:08:37.451 --> 00:08:42.308
experience, and if you haven't had the opportunity
to sit down at a table and roll some dice and just

00:08:42.308 --> 00:08:46.969
create an improvised story with friends, or find
new friends through that process, I highly

00:08:46.969 --> 00:08:52.968
recommend it. There are a number of wonderful
people that volunteer at every convention to run

00:08:52.968 --> 00:08:57.970
gaming groups, and to Dungeon Master or Game
Master games at various events. And if you haven't

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:02.810
had the chance, and you have a free evening, look
it up. Give it a shot. You'd be surprised how

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:08.705
wonderful and welcoming these people are. You
think anime conventions are welcoming? Let your

00:09:08.705 --> 00:09:14.070
freak flag fly? The tabletop community's been
doing this for 34 years!

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:14.496
(cheering)

00:09:17.667 --> 00:09:24.091
MATT: So take that jump. And it may take you a
while to find the right group, 'cause, you know,

00:09:24.091 --> 00:09:28.136
different people do have different perspectives,
and that's not a bad thing. Some gaming group you

00:09:28.136 --> 00:09:33.234
might go to might be very, very hardcore heavy,
intense roleplaying, and you're like, "I want more

00:09:33.234 --> 00:09:36.958
of a casual gaming
roll-dice-and-kill-things-take-loot experience.

00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:42.269
And that's cool. Just make sure that you express
that at the very beginning so you can decide

00:09:42.269 --> 00:09:46.388
whether or not it's the type of game for you, and
you don't have to cause any negative emotions. And

00:09:46.388 --> 00:09:50.496
conversely, if you still want to play together
even though you have these different ideas, talk

00:09:50.496 --> 00:09:54.666
to your Dungeon Master or Game Master about trying
to facilitate a story that gives you a little bit

00:09:54.666 --> 00:10:00.635
of both. You may end up finding yourself pulled
out of your comfort zone and end up enjoying that

00:10:00.635 --> 00:10:04.741
part of the roleplaying game you didn't think you
did. If you're like, "No, I just want to min-max

00:10:04.741 --> 00:10:09.843
"my characters and defeat demons and see how much
experience points I can get," if you allow

00:10:09.843 --> 00:10:15.034
yourself to maybe step into that discomfort of
roleplaying and maybe coming up with a character

00:10:15.034 --> 00:10:20.657
voice or, at the very least, talking in character,
it may feel a little weird at first, but you might

00:10:20.661 --> 00:10:26.039
be surprised at how much you enjoy it. Conversely,
if you're heavy into community theater and you're

00:10:26.039 --> 00:10:30.919
like, "I love D&amp;D because of the drama." And you
show up to a table that are like, "That's cool,

00:10:30.919 --> 00:10:39.018
"man, roll your attack." Don't be afraid to embrace
the ruleset either. And one thing I want to

00:10:39.039 --> 00:10:45.629
express here is, every Dungeon Master, Game
Master, has their own specific, unique style,

00:10:45.898 --> 00:10:50.990
you can't expect one table to be like the other. I
want to try and get this across as much as I can.

00:10:51.023 --> 00:10:56.225
I'm so happy that Critical Role has found such a
great community, and people seem to resonate with

00:10:56.225 --> 00:11:01.407
our storytelling, but I'm also a very different
Dungeon Master than everyone out there. And I

00:11:01.407 --> 00:11:07.359
don't want anybody to go to a table and expect
what I provide at anybody else's game. They'll

00:11:07.359 --> 00:11:13.391
provide some things that may not be quite what I
do, or not quite as good as I do, and they'll

00:11:13.391 --> 00:11:17.075
provide some things that are far better than 
I provide. Every person has their strengths and

00:11:17.108 --> 00:11:22.295
weaknesses. I'm very heavy narrative, I'm very
heavy into the intense roleplaying circumstances

00:11:22.295 --> 00:11:31.054
and the actor-driven character breakdowns and
existential crisis that is human existence...

00:11:31.054 --> 00:11:38.856
while also killing shit every now and then. Other
tables-- I try and play the rules as well as I

00:11:38.856 --> 00:11:42.343
can, but also, I mess up the rules every now and
then, as I'm sure you've seen Twitch chat mention.

00:11:42.343 --> 00:11:45.912
(laughter)

00:11:45.912 --> 00:11:48.344
MATT: But that's part of the fun, too. There are
people that are much better at keeping a cohesive

00:11:48.344 --> 00:11:53.204
ruleset, or running a very open-ended sandbox,
political-based, driving outside of the story

00:11:53.204 --> 00:11:58.101
campaign, and I don't know how to do that. I
couldn't if I wanted to. But those games are

00:11:58.101 --> 00:12:03.053
magnificent and incredible for their own right,
too. So, you know, I guess what I want to say is

00:12:03.053 --> 00:12:08.561
if you go into a table, go in with as little
expectation as you can, embrace and enjoy what's

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:13.772
being provided there, and do your best to try and
take it for that. Because one, we don't need any

00:12:13.772 --> 00:12:17.644
more pressure on GMs out there to try and be
something they're not. It's already a big

00:12:17.644 --> 00:12:22.257
undertaking; it's a heavy task to run a story for
a party, but it's also one of the most rewarding

00:12:22.257 --> 00:12:27.230
out there, as long as the players are able to
appreciate and express that appreciation for the

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:32.122
time and energy that the GM has put into it.
Anyway. Tangent. Hi.

00:12:32.122 --> 00:12:34.142
(laughter)

00:12:34.142 --> 00:12:35.773
MATT: I did get a full night's sleep last night.

00:12:35.773 --> 00:12:39.210
(cheering)

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:48.812
MATT: The first in probably three to four weeks.
Between MomoCon and the Tomb of Annihilation

00:12:48.812 --> 00:12:56.141
reveal stream the weekend before that, and then--
it's been a month. But it's been a good month.

00:12:56.141 --> 00:13:03.623
It's been a very good month. Now we're rolling
into Anime Expo/Comic Con/Gen Con. Gen Con. Gen

00:13:03.623 --> 00:13:09.342
Con! I'm so excited. It's their 50th anniversary.
50 years since Gen Con's been around as a gaming

00:13:09.342 --> 00:13:12.772
convention. That's crazy. A
gaming-fantasy-sci-fi-- it's just a genre

00:13:12.772 --> 00:13:19.193
convention that is-- it was one of my bucket list
things for years and years and years. I got to go

00:13:19.193 --> 00:13:22.791
for the first time last year, and it was-- you
could hear the Dance of the Sugarplum Fairies

00:13:22.791 --> 00:13:32.891
playing as I danced around, like-- Steve Jackson
Games! Carcathon! It was really exciting. If you

00:13:32.891 --> 00:13:38.282
have the opportunity ever to go to Gen Con, you
will game the whole weekend. It's going to be

00:13:38.282 --> 00:13:47.562
amazing. But this year, we're launching the--
releasing the first Exandria campaign guide.

00:13:47.562 --> 00:13:55.411
(cheering)

00:13:55.411 --> 00:14:03.433
MATT: Thank you. I hope you like it. I've never
written anything like this before. It was an

00:14:03.433 --> 00:14:09.871
undertaking. It wasn't something I wanted to do,
originally. When Green Ronin contacted me about a

00:14:09.871 --> 00:14:12.550
year and a half ago, they were like, "Hey, would
you be interested in doing this?" I was like, "Um.

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:23.612
"I mean. Sure? What do I-- Oh, no. I signed a
contract. Now I've got to do this." So I had to go

00:14:23.612 --> 00:14:27.912
through all my old notes and extrapolate on things
that had been forgotten or put to the wayside;

00:14:27.912 --> 00:14:31.081
things that the players had never actually
discovered, you know, side quests and story

00:14:31.081 --> 00:14:35.911
elements that got bypassed and forgotten, because
that's how D&amp;D works. But I got to go ahead and

00:14:35.911 --> 00:14:41.610
flesh those out and put them into a book, and had
to fill out the rest of the territory and put my

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:45.127
thoughts on a page and then think about it and
write it in a way where somebody else could

00:14:45.127 --> 00:14:49.523
actually comprehend what the hell I'm talking
about. So it's been a very, very unique process,

00:14:49.608 --> 00:14:55.942
and I'm really excited, and I hope people like it.
I mean, it's hard to look at that compared to all the

00:14:55.942 --> 00:15:00.424
main published settings out there. I grew up
reading the Eberron, Forgotten Realms,

00:15:00.424 --> 00:15:08.532
Dragonlance, Greyhawk, all these classic-- Dark
Sun! They're all so amazing and unique, and my

00:15:08.532 --> 00:15:13.194
world started without the intent of becoming a
setting. I was literally just doing a vanilla

00:15:13.194 --> 00:15:16.711
fantasy made-up world for my friends who had never
played D&amp;D before, so it's been a very unique

00:15:16.711 --> 00:15:21.415
challenge to try and find how it can stand unique
against other settings while still staying true to

00:15:21.415 --> 00:15:26.522
how we built it naturally over the past four or
five years, and throw a couple fun surprises in

00:15:26.522 --> 00:15:33.023
there. Like, it made me think about a calendar.
How many days are there in an Exandrian year?

00:15:33.023 --> 00:15:39.020
Okay. And now there's 11 months. What are they
called and why? Okay, they have holidays. Oh man.

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:51.281
So yeah. It's been a very, very unique-- very
unique process. So I hope you enjoy it. What else

00:15:51.281 --> 00:15:56.853
is coming up? We had our 100th episode, we
announced-- well, we announced we're

00:15:56.853 --> 00:15:58.721
putting everything in a podcast form now, which is
great.

00:15:58.727 --> 00:16:01.106
(cheering)

00:16:01.106 --> 00:16:02.649
MATT: Took long enough.

00:16:02.649 --> 00:16:03.945
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you!

00:16:03.945 --> 00:16:06.477
MATT: Oh, you're welcome. We've been wanting it
for a long time, and it's always been one of

00:16:06.477 --> 00:16:12.412
those, "Eh, it's too hard. It's a lot of content."
And then some people higher up in Legendary

00:16:12.412 --> 00:16:16.747
changed over and the new people, we're like, "Can
we do a podcast?" They're like, "Oh yeah, sure."

00:16:16.789 --> 00:16:18.539
(laughter)

00:16:18.539 --> 00:16:23.537
MATT: Okay! So really glad we're going to get that
out to you guys. We have a month or so and we'll

00:16:23.537 --> 00:16:28.639
start doing the full rollout, the releasing of episodes
until we're caught up and have it out there. So

00:16:28.639 --> 00:16:34.376
those who have like, "I'd like to dive into
Critical Role, but the videos eat too much data on

00:16:34.398 --> 00:16:38.069
"my plan when I'm out driving," you can now
download it as a podcast.

00:16:38.148 --> 00:16:42.437
(cheering)

00:16:42.437 --> 00:16:47.156
MATT: And we're going to have some other cool
announcements in the coming weeks, which, things

00:16:47.156 --> 00:16:52.251
that we were hoping to announce on the 100th, but
things had to fall into place right, so we have a

00:16:52.251 --> 00:16:59.218
couple fun things scattered throughout the next
few weeks or so, so keep an ear out. Anyway. I've

00:16:59.218 --> 00:17:03.117
been talking at you for a lot, and I'm sure many
of you have some interesting and unique questions,

00:17:03.117 --> 00:17:07.293
because I like to have more of a conversation at a
panel than just me going, "Hi, words, listen."

00:17:07.293 --> 00:17:09.834
(laughter)

00:17:09.834 --> 00:17:13.976
MATT: So. That being the case, I don't know what
would be the best way. How do you want to do this?

00:17:13.976 --> 00:17:15.326
How do you want to put the mic--

00:17:15.326 --> 00:17:18.574
(cheering)

00:17:18.574 --> 00:17:22.576
MODERATOR: Okay, so we're going to be doing the
Q&amp;A style. I want everyone who has a question for

00:17:22.576 --> 00:17:29.377
Matt Mercer to come in the middle in a straight
line and I'll hand you a microphone. Once you're

00:17:29.377 --> 00:17:33.962
done with your question, you give it to the person
behind you. Also, if you have gifts for Matt

00:17:33.962 --> 00:17:38.986
Mercer, I will be taking them from you, and I will
put them over in this nice, pretty corner, okay?

00:17:38.986 --> 00:17:41.227
MATT: Don't encourage it!

00:17:41.227 --> 00:17:44.625
(laughter)

00:17:44.625 --> 00:17:52.952
MATT: Give things to sacrifice at the altar of
dark energy. Lay them into the flames and bow.

00:17:52.952 --> 00:18:00.887
That's what we're doing now. Into the trash fire
that I lit at the start of the panel. Yes, please.

00:18:00.887 --> 00:18:09.757
Breathe the fumes. Ahh. All righty. Shh!

00:18:09.757 --> 00:18:14.198
(chatter)

00:18:14.198 --> 00:18:16.757
MATT: That would be actually some great room
walla, right there. That was some great peas and

00:18:16.757 --> 00:18:18.667
carrots, guys, well done.

00:18:18.667 --> 00:18:20.808
MODERATOR: Also, make sure to introduce yourself.

00:18:20.808 --> 00:18:25.416
MATT: Yes, please! I want to know your name! Hi!

00:18:25.416 --> 00:18:30.418
IKO: Sorry, I might cry, I thought you were a
cryptid for the longest time. Not real.

00:18:30.418 --> 00:18:33.143
(laughter)

00:18:33.143 --> 00:18:34.243
IKO: Hi, my name's Iko.

00:18:34.243 --> 00:18:35.448
MATT: Hi, Iko.

00:18:35.448 --> 00:18:38.668
IKO: Okay. I had my birthday recently--

00:18:38.668 --> 00:18:39.987
MATT: Happy birthday!

00:18:39.987 --> 00:18:41.025
IKO: Thank you.

00:18:41.025 --> 00:18:43.902
(cheering)

00:18:43.902 --> 00:18:48.146
IKO: And of course, in Critical Role tradition, I
wanted to start a DM campaign, but I also watch

00:18:48.146 --> 00:18:57.879
Vox Machina, so what is your favorite JRPG, why,
and how did it help you become-- you don't have to

00:18:57.879 --> 00:19:00.478
answer it all, but how did you become a better
storyteller?

00:19:00.478 --> 00:19:01.834
MATT: Oh, man.

00:19:01.834 --> 00:19:03.699
IKO: Yeah, right?

00:19:03.699 --> 00:19:05.746
MATT: You're making me choose.

00:19:05.746 --> 00:19:07.597
IKO: You asked us to!

00:19:07.597 --> 00:19:18.489
MATT: Because I-- I'm like-- I got my Final Fantasy
VI here, and I got my Chrono Trigger here, and I

00:19:18.489 --> 00:19:25.726
got my Suikoden I and II here. Ah, why are you
doing this to me? I'll have-- okay, no, I'll go

00:19:25.726 --> 00:19:30.485
with probably Final Fantasy VI overall.

00:19:30.485 --> 00:19:34.240
(cheering)

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:37.637
MATT: Partly because, one, when it came out it was
seriously pushing the limits of what we had seen

00:19:37.637 --> 00:19:43.329
capable of the SNES, especially once you got your
first airship moment in-game, you're like, "What?!

00:19:43.389 --> 00:19:52.146
"It's a 3D round world!" But the story was so rich,
the characters were so deep, and the story

00:19:52.146 --> 00:19:59.663
respected you enough to go into some interesting,
dark adult themes that dealt with elements of loss of one's

00:19:59.702 --> 00:20:06.436
family, of suicide-- going into a lot of really
interesting, dark places that these tiny little

00:20:06.436 --> 00:20:11.983
16-bit characters that are maybe a collection of
40 pixels still make you cry in your room, going

00:20:11.983 --> 00:20:17.765
like, "No, Celes, don't do it! You just need to
find healthier fish to feed to Cid until he gets

00:20:17.765 --> 00:20:26.927
"better." That's a real part of the game. It was an
incredible story, such a wonderfully thought-out

00:20:26.927 --> 00:20:36.413
world, and then you had a wendigo in your party,
and Gogo, whatever the hell he was. It was such a

00:20:36.413 --> 00:20:42.858
good game, and you had the loss of Captain Leo. It
was a dark RPG compared to previous ones, so I

00:20:42.858 --> 00:20:49.425
loved that one and it affected me profoundly when
it came out. So I'd say, in the ways it helped me

00:20:49.425 --> 00:20:59.417
run a game, it tremendously helped me understand
that there is a lot of enjoyment in the difficulty

00:20:59.417 --> 00:21:03.767
of adversity and overcoming it. And it also
allowed me to understand that sometimes it's okay

00:21:03.767 --> 00:21:09.107
to have a villain that's just pure evil. I love
myself villains you can understand-- Sephiroth,

00:21:09.107 --> 00:21:14.775
you're like, "Aw, you poor thing, you were lied to
and abused by the military-industrial complex of

00:21:14.775 --> 00:21:19.736
"Shinryu growing up, and you're not really at fault
for how you turned out." Kefka? Oh, you're just a

00:21:19.736 --> 00:21:28.509
dick. You're just a terrible little clown man. And
you hated him and you loved hating him. So yeah, I

00:21:28.509 --> 00:21:32.687
learned a lot about that type of a villain
archetype, I learned about various ways to tell

00:21:32.725 --> 00:21:36.715
elements of a dark story that can still be
compelling. Even though you're dragging your

00:21:36.715 --> 00:21:40.444
players through the muck, they'll still thank you
and be like, "That was really impactful and helped

00:21:40.444 --> 00:21:45.947
"me work out some things I wasn't thinking
about." You're like, "Oh, you're welcome. I'll

00:21:45.979 --> 00:21:47.999
"bill you for the therapy later."

00:21:47.999 --> 00:21:50.117
(laughter)

00:21:50.117 --> 00:21:52.436
MATT: Good question.

00:21:52.436 --> 00:21:53.745
DANIEL: Hello, I'm Daniel.

00:21:53.745 --> 00:21:54.695
MATT: Daniel.

00:21:54.695 --> 00:21:57.357
DANIEL: First thing I have to ask is, how are the
dice I gave you last year?

00:21:57.357 --> 00:21:58.344
MATT: How's what?

00:21:58.344 --> 00:21:59.894
DANIEL: How are the dice I gave you last year at
A-Kon?

00:21:59.894 --> 00:22:07.821
MATT: Oh, I have a giant collection-- actually,
this is kind of cool. Me and Marisha have our

00:22:07.821 --> 00:22:14.189
giant dice collection that we're throwing into
this large glass, round fishbowl kind of thing,

00:22:14.189 --> 00:22:22.298
which is ironic now based on what happened a few
episodes ago. But-- yes! We are gods!

00:22:22.298 --> 00:22:27.116
(laughter)

00:22:27.116 --> 00:22:33.055
MATT: So whenever we're running a game outside of
Critical Role, like whenever we do CelebriD&amp;D things

00:22:33.055 --> 00:22:38.844
or run a game for Wizards, I'll go ahead and grab
a set of dice out of that, like a handful, and it

00:22:38.844 --> 00:22:43.597
randomizes each time, so I'm always playing with
somebody else's dice that was granted in the

00:22:43.597 --> 00:22:47.405
community when I go and play one of those events.
And they do swap out sometimes the dice I use in

00:22:47.405 --> 00:22:52.036
the show. I have one or two dice that are
mainstays, that are kind of like my-- for lack of

00:22:52.036 --> 00:22:55.935
a better term, my traditional--

00:22:55.935 --> 00:22:57.181
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Fate dice?

00:22:57.181 --> 00:23:04.204
MATT: The word I'm looking for is my superstition
dice. Like I have my one big fate die, which is

00:23:04.235 --> 00:23:09.910
the Shapeways mine-looking one that I do for big
rolls. So I'll keep those around, but I'll swap

00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:15.108
out every now and then so I have that constant
flow of community-given dice through my gameplay.

00:23:15.108 --> 00:23:23.020
DANIEL: And the second main one I wanted to ask
is, when everyone rerolls everything and becomes

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:29.887
new characters, will you allow non-human
half-elves, such as half-elf, half-dragons? Or

00:23:29.887 --> 00:23:36.768
such as half-elf, half-werewolves? Or such as
half-elf, half-celestials?

00:23:36.768 --> 00:23:40.813
MATT: I mean, if the player's really driven in
that direction? We can discuss and work something

00:23:40.813 --> 00:23:46.480
out. That's really up to the player, though. On
some degree, depending on the player, might be

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:57.338
like, "Ooh, I want to play a half-gelatinous cube,
half-kobold." And you're like, "Okay. Um. Keeping

00:23:57.338 --> 00:24:00.295
"that armor on's going to be really weird. Sure."

00:24:00.295 --> 00:24:01.830
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Sam would!

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:06.610
MATT: Yeah, Sam would. He'd pull it off, probably.
But yeah, I leave it up to the players. I think

00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:11.337
some of them feel a bit of comfort in the existing
racial elements, but they've expanded since we

00:24:11.337 --> 00:24:17.459
started this campaign with Volo's Guide to the
monstrous races, so I'm hoping to see some weird,

00:24:17.459 --> 00:24:23.919
interesting variations there. Which, by the way,
half-elf, half-werewolf technically is full elf

00:24:23.919 --> 00:24:25.769
with lycanthropy.

00:24:25.769 --> 00:24:30.159
(cheering)

00:24:30.159 --> 00:24:34.968
MATT: Depending on how you run your campaign. If
werewolf is its own race, then probably go for it.

00:24:34.968 --> 00:24:36.998
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible)

00:24:36.998 --> 00:24:45.818
MATT: This is true. You're right. I stand
corrected. Well done. (laughs) You're my new

00:24:45.818 --> 00:24:49.078
redshirt guy. That's awesome. Hello, sir.

00:24:49.078 --> 00:24:55.177
CHRIS: Hi. My name's Chris. I too have
disadvantage on social interactions and composure.

00:24:55.177 --> 00:25:04.507
So my question is that you obviously have a little
bit of time to prepare for each episode every

00:25:04.507 --> 00:25:12.408
week. I just want to know what kind of references
from art, media that you fall on as you're

00:25:12.408 --> 00:25:14.108
preparing those games.

00:25:14.108 --> 00:25:18.659
MATT: Ironic based on the question earlier, I
listen to a lot of video game soundtracks while

00:25:18.659 --> 00:25:24.564
I'm writing. Honestly, my mainstay playlist is
a really great Chrono Trigger symphonic

00:25:24.564 --> 00:25:30.696
soundtrack that exists out there. There's three
discs, and it's amazing. So I'll have that on

00:25:30.738 --> 00:25:36.708
random play, and I'll throw in some Dark Souls
soundtrack stuff, I'll throw in some old Suikoden

00:25:36.708 --> 00:25:42.647
I. A lot of nostalgic music, because to me that
brings me to a really creative place, so I'll just

00:25:42.647 --> 00:25:45.487
have that thrown in there with-- some Super
Metroid, actually, goes in there really well, too.

00:25:45.487 --> 00:25:55.549
Oh, Super Metroid. But yeah, so that helps me out.
As far as other media, I don't specifically look

00:25:55.549 --> 00:25:59.317
to other forms of media to inspire me,
necessarily. If I have-- I don't want to feel too

00:25:59.317 --> 00:26:04.187
influenced, and I've consumed so much media in the
past that I think the nostalgia factor lets me

00:26:04.187 --> 00:26:06.877
just think back to some things that have
profoundly affected me in the past, things that

00:26:06.877 --> 00:26:12.226
hung on. But I'm sure parts have leaned into it
here and there. Like being reminded of American

00:26:12.226 --> 00:26:18.337
Gods, because the new show's playing now, Stars,
which is-- took a couple episodes to really get

00:26:18.337 --> 00:26:25.629
going, and now it's so good. So yeah. Those
elements-- as that show started, I'm like, "Oh,

00:26:25.629 --> 00:26:32.810
"we're getting into an interesting arc now." So
yeah, who knows? It's hard not to have the media

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:36.779
around you influence you. Everything is derivative
to a certain extent, and usually with respect and

00:26:36.779 --> 00:26:42.347
love. Even a lot of the storylines I do, as much
as I say, "I created this story," but if you break

00:26:42.347 --> 00:26:46.611
it down, I'm sure there's basis and influences from
three or four different things that all led to

00:26:46.611 --> 00:26:51.637
this idea, because that's just the nature of
writing in media. Rarely is anything truly unique,

00:26:51.637 --> 00:26:56.160
and when they do, it blows my mind. But music is a
big thing for me. Music's just always been a

00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:02.022
creative trigger, and that helps me out
tremendously. Cool, good question. Hello!

00:27:02.022 --> 00:27:05.842
SYDNEY: Hi. I'm Sydney.

00:27:05.842 --> 00:27:07.041
MATT: Hi, Sydney.

00:27:07.041 --> 00:27:11.701
SYDNEY: Of all the things I could spew out of my
mouth, I just have one thing that I can think of.

00:27:11.701 --> 00:27:15.482
Are you a cowboy in a man costume?

00:27:15.482 --> 00:27:17.781
MATT: Am I a what?

00:27:17.781 --> 00:27:22.291
SYDNEY: Are you a cowboy in a man costume?

00:27:22.291 --> 00:27:23.771
MATT: A cowboy in a man costume?

00:27:23.771 --> 00:27:24.701
SYDNEY: Yes.

00:27:24.701 --> 00:27:27.401
(laughter)

00:27:27.401 --> 00:27:29.035
MATT: (McCree voice) I don't know what you're
talking about.

00:27:29.035 --> 00:27:36.720
(cheering)

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:49.140
MATT: (McCree voice) But nice try. (laughs) Well
played. Hello, sir. (Gilmore voice) You're wearing

00:27:49.176 --> 00:27:50.558
the proper t-shirt, I see.

00:27:50.558 --> 00:27:56.732
PABLO: Thank you, thank you. I'll try to follow up
on that. My name's Pablo. The question I have was

00:27:56.732 --> 00:28:02.364
regarding-- I guess the title of the panel is--
part of the title was "The Renaissance of Tabletop

00:28:02.364 --> 00:28:07.985
"Gaming". I wanted to know what you think that-- if
there was a specific point or watershed moment

00:28:07.985 --> 00:28:12.934
that you could point to and be like, "Yes, this
is when tabletop gaming came back into the public

00:28:12.942 --> 00:28:17.265
"consciousness and it's now more acceptable," if
that's what you think?

00:28:17.265 --> 00:28:22.724
MATT: No, no, it's a valid point. It kind of began
with 3rd Edition, because after the satanic panic

00:28:22.724 --> 00:28:31.865
of the 80s and such, D&amp;D and roleplaying games in
general really became a niche, basement game. Even

00:28:31.865 --> 00:28:41.156
all the old Risk games and the early World of
Darkness, and Mutants and Superheroes and all the

00:28:41.156 --> 00:28:45.364
different RPGs of that time, it was all very still
enclosed, don't talk about it publicly amongst

00:28:45.364 --> 00:28:50.054
other people in the high school, dear God, don't
let them know I play D&amp;D. That type of an era. 3rd

00:28:50.064 --> 00:28:54.846
Edition came out, and it was a little more
accessible, it brought the community back. The

00:28:54.846 --> 00:29:02.809
main community. But as far as a major social
rediscovery of the game, I think a lot of it has

00:29:02.809 --> 00:29:10.254
to do, in a weird way-- and one of the early
triggers, I think, was Vin Diesel. When you have a

00:29:10.254 --> 00:29:15.449
man who is on such an international level of
stardom that everybody knows him, and then

00:29:15.449 --> 00:29:20.685
suddenly word comes out that he plays D&amp;D, and
they start asking him this question at different

00:29:20.685 --> 00:29:26.096
celebrity events, and he starts talking about it
in a non-shameful way? When he's like, "Yeah, I

00:29:26.096 --> 00:29:30.346
"play D&amp;D! It's great! Yeah, I have my character's
name tattooed on my side, yeah, he's named Melkor

00:29:30.346 --> 00:29:38.345
"because I love Tolkein, what? I'm Vin Diesel." That was a
huge step, because all of a sudden people were

00:29:38.421 --> 00:29:45.796
like, "Whoa, Vin Diesel plays D&amp;D? I mean, anybody can
play D&amp;D then." And then we have Stephen Colbert

00:29:45.804 --> 00:29:50.884
being so out and loud about his Tolkein obsession.
And it's just become this slow-rolling social

00:29:50.884 --> 00:29:55.136
acceptance of, "Oh, well, if these cool people
play it, it can't be that bad." So that began it a

00:29:55.136 --> 00:30:02.075
little bit. Then I think Acquisitions Inc. helped
tremendously; a lot of the PAX games they would

00:30:02.075 --> 00:30:05.819
run, because they brought in some celebrity
talent, which brought some more. When I say celebrity

00:30:05.819 --> 00:30:15.405
talent, I mean like Patrick Rothfuss, a very, very
well-established writer. Yeah, the PVP guys. Wil.

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:21.265
All these different people that began to just generate this
momentum for the community to rally more in a

00:30:21.265 --> 00:30:29.744
media way. And then you have the Roleplay Guys,
with JP and Adam Koebel and Steve Lumpkin, all

00:30:29.744 --> 00:30:33.875
these guys that ran these great online games and
began to build more and more of this community of

00:30:33.875 --> 00:30:37.985
people that can see people playing and enjoying
the game if they didn't have a frame of reference.

00:30:37.985 --> 00:30:43.416
And then when Twitch emerged, it was a platform
that allowed us to do it live, and allowed us to

00:30:43.416 --> 00:30:48.334
do it uncut, unedited, just raw and
in-the-moment, and that was really the reason we

00:30:48.334 --> 00:30:53.064
started streaming our game. There wasn't a-- we
didn't want it refilmed and released and edited.

00:30:53.064 --> 00:30:57.693
We didn't want it to be this presentory form. We
wanted to just play our game, and if there were

00:30:57.693 --> 00:31:02.066
cameras there, then let it be. And I think that
resonated, because it felt like you were just

00:31:02.066 --> 00:31:06.509
peeking in on somebody's game, and you were kind
of invited to the table. And so as those streams

00:31:06.509 --> 00:31:10.543
began to become more and more prominent, it
allowed, one, people who used to play and then had

00:31:10.543 --> 00:31:15.484
families and kids and jobs and didn't have the
time to do it anymore, an outlet to play

00:31:15.484 --> 00:31:19.724
vicariously through these streams and get excited
again about a hobby that meant a lot to them when

00:31:19.724 --> 00:31:24.987
they were growing up, or remind them how much they
enjoyed it so they can get back in contact with

00:31:24.987 --> 00:31:30.064
their old friends and start playing again, or a
younger generation that never had an opportunity

00:31:30.064 --> 00:31:34.823
to really be exposed to this that are now seeing
it for the first time and going, "Oh, that looks

00:31:34.823 --> 00:31:39.035
"like a lot of fun and very different than the
video games I play online. Let me try this." And

00:31:39.035 --> 00:31:43.153
as such, we have this amazing community that
continues to spread. So I think a lot of it has to

00:31:43.153 --> 00:31:49.446
do with all those predecessors that kind of paved
the way, and then now, thanks to streaming, it's

00:31:49.446 --> 00:31:54.496
allowed a lot more people to see it and connect
it. So many people have come to me and said, "I

00:31:54.496 --> 00:31:59.041
"didn't even know what D&amp;D was or how it worked
until I saw your show, and I'm like, 'Oh, I can do

00:31:59.041 --> 00:32:02.607
"'that!'" And I'm like, "That's why I started doing
it. That's exactly why." Because I wanted people

00:32:02.607 --> 00:32:07.488
to look at it and go, "Oh. I can do that. I want
to go do that with my friends. I want to go do

00:32:07.488 --> 00:32:14.009
"that with my friends!" So for what small part we've
played, we're super proud and excited that it's

00:32:14.009 --> 00:32:22.578
become this renaissance, and we're a small of a
large part, and that involves you guys. We're

00:32:22.578 --> 00:32:27.059
nothing without you guys. You community build
everything. You've become more important about the

00:32:27.059 --> 00:32:31.397
show than we have. Legitimately. Because you all
support each other so much, because you guys are

00:32:31.397 --> 00:32:36.326
so great at helping each other out, and signal
boosting when someone in the community needs help

00:32:36.326 --> 00:32:41.988
or needs assurance, and running games for people
that can't find other players in their vicinity,

00:32:41.988 --> 00:32:48.784
and when times are hard on a global scale, on a
micro-, local scale just making sure that everyone knows

00:32:48.902 --> 00:32:54.909
that we have a community of Critters around. So
you guys really are the reason that this shit is

00:32:54.909 --> 00:32:58.449
working and becoming so prominent. So thank you,
tremendously.

00:32:58.449 --> 00:33:04.417
(cheering)

00:33:04.417 --> 00:33:05.499
MATT: And hello!

00:33:05.499 --> 00:33:11.046
JOCELYN: Hi! It's been a while. I don't know why,
but I'm feeling as excited-slash-nervous as when I

00:33:11.046 --> 00:33:12.687
met you a year ago.

00:33:12.687 --> 00:33:14.318
MATT: Good.

00:33:14.318 --> 00:33:16.309
(laughter)

00:33:16.309 --> 00:33:24.161
JOCELYN: Well, that's good. Anyway, hi, I'm
Jocelyn. You remember me. I did mention a

00:33:24.161 --> 00:33:27.643
surprise. She managed to get it, and hopefully
you'll see it later.

00:33:27.643 --> 00:33:32.839
MATT: Oh, okay. Thank you. Does it detonate?

00:33:32.839 --> 00:33:35.710
JOCELYN: No, but--

00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:37.279
MATT: Just making sure.

00:33:37.279 --> 00:33:44.417
JOCELYN: It's nice of you to mention your dice,
because you might be adding to it? Except in more

00:33:44.417 --> 00:33:48.290
ways than one with those. For you and Marisha.
It's an engagement gift.

00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:49.789
MATT: Oh, thank you!

00:33:49.789 --> 00:33:53.688
(awws, cheering)

00:33:53.688 --> 00:34:01.967
JOCELYN: My boyfriend and I actually found them at
our local game store near my house, and once I saw

00:34:01.967 --> 00:34:04.389
them, bam, "Matt and Marisha need these."

00:34:04.389 --> 00:34:06.938
MATT: Thank you, I appreciate that.

00:34:06.938 --> 00:34:13.198
JOCELYN: Anyway. Good God. I have three questions
running around in my head, but I'll stick to one.

00:34:13.198 --> 00:34:21.039
What was your favorite comedic moment from when
you played in the most recent one-shot that Liam

00:34:21.039 --> 00:34:22.619
was running?

00:34:22.619 --> 00:34:27.864
MATT: Oh, man. For those who don't know, Liam
O'Brien, one of our players, another voice actor,

00:34:27.864 --> 00:34:34.720
he ran a one-shot for all of us where we all woke
up as ourselves, but children. Very Stranger

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:41.799
Things-style. And it had some wonderful comedic
moments, some really dark moments, some really

00:34:41.799 --> 00:34:45.828
heartfelt moments. It was wonderful. I think my
favorite comedic moment is the fact that Travis

00:34:45.828 --> 00:34:55.037
Willingham just runs from everything. Like, as a
guy who, in his adult years, 6'4", built like a

00:34:55.037 --> 00:35:00.148
truck, plays Grog, a barbarian that just runs
screaming into battle, ready to shed blood, plays

00:35:00.148 --> 00:35:05.828
himself as a child and every encounter he's like,
"I turn around and run. I run as fast as I can."

00:35:05.828 --> 00:35:11.611
And then watching Laura be like, "What are you
doing?! It's attacking me!" He's like, "I don't care."

00:35:11.611 --> 00:35:14.648
(laughter)

00:35:14.648 --> 00:35:20.488
MATT: So I'd probably have to go with that. Or, as
part of the encounter, we ended up on the

00:35:20.488 --> 00:35:30.075
soundstage with Neil-- he's the director of Last
of Us and Uncharted 4-- as kind of an inside joke,

00:35:30.075 --> 00:35:36.144
and in the battle, as the electronics went crazy
and ended up murdering people, ended up killing

00:35:36.144 --> 00:35:41.326
Neil, and then as we were leaving the room, Sam
goes up and drops his headshot and resume and

00:35:41.326 --> 00:35:44.299
goes, "By way, if you're ever looking to cast
again, let somebody know, I'd love to work with

00:35:44.299 --> 00:35:50.068
"you." That was a pretty great moment, too. Thank
you! Hi!

00:35:50.068 --> 00:35:56.108
DELPHINE: Hi! I'm Delphine. First of all, really
quick shout-out to my friend who's dressed up as Victor.

00:35:56.108 --> 00:35:58.619
(cheering)

00:35:58.619 --> 00:36:04.000
MATT: Yes, I saw you earlier! (Victor voice) It's
good coffee!

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.809
(laughter)

00:36:06.809 --> 00:36:11.378
MATT: I love it. We all will learn from your
mistakes, Victor.

00:36:11.378 --> 00:36:16.017
DELPHINE: My question is less about gaming and
more of a personal thing. I know you've been to

00:36:16.017 --> 00:36:22.691
Australia, and I was wondering if you had a
favorite place to travel or any fun traveling stories?

00:36:22.691 --> 00:36:30.192
MATT: Oh man. I mean, I love to travel in general,
because you get the opportunity to meet people from

00:36:30.192 --> 00:36:35.259
different cultures and learn about history from
different places in the world. We're Americans.

00:36:35.259 --> 00:36:39.828
We're one of the youngest countries in the world,
and you're like, "Oh yeah, we have history. This

00:36:39.828 --> 00:36:46.609
"building is 60 years old! Oh man!" Then you go to
Europe and it's like, "This one is 600 years old."

00:36:46.609 --> 00:36:48.607
And you're like, "And it's a 7-Eleven."

00:36:48.607 --> 00:36:51.368
(laughter)

00:36:51.368 --> 00:36:55.427
MATT: Which happened! I was in Gothernburg, Sweden
years ago, and there was this beautiful stone

00:36:55.427 --> 00:36:59.408
archway with a gargoyle that's a Gothic-style
structure. I walk in and it's a 7-Eleven. I'm

00:36:59.408 --> 00:37:09.109
like, "Oh. That feels so wrong." But for me, what
I love about traveling is rediscovering that no

00:37:09.109 --> 00:37:15.308
matter where you travel, people are really the
same. Like, people, once again, just want to be

00:37:15.308 --> 00:37:19.653
happy. They like to meet new people, learn things,
and provide for each other, and get excited to

00:37:19.653 --> 00:37:24.299
share their culture with you and vice-versa and
ask you about yours. No matter where you go, no

00:37:24.299 --> 00:37:29.628
matter what your religious background is, no
matter what your family's history is, we're all so

00:37:29.628 --> 00:37:31.213
fucking similar!

00:37:31.213 --> 00:37:35.708
(cheering)

00:37:35.708 --> 00:37:39.476
MATT: And it proves itself time and time and time
again. So that's my favorite part of traveling,

00:37:39.476 --> 00:37:46.368
honestly. As far as favorite place to go? I don't
know, man, it's hard to pick. I really, really

00:37:46.368 --> 00:37:54.777
enjoyed Ireland. Ireland felt like a fantasy
world. Everything was just green and lush and the

00:37:54.777 --> 00:38:01.797
skies were gray and rainy. It was Matt wonderland.
And everyone sounded whimsical and drank a lot of

00:38:01.797 --> 00:38:06.966
alcohol. Kept trying to give it to me, and I was
like, "I don't drink that much. I'll just-- okay,

00:38:06.966 --> 00:38:14.107
"oh god. What happened to the last 12 hours?" So
Ireland was a lot of fun. Definitely. Good

00:38:14.107 --> 00:38:16.258
question. Hello!

00:38:16.258 --> 00:38:24.237
NICK: Hi. I'm Nick. I just recently in the past
six months started playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons,

00:38:24.237 --> 00:38:25.535
as both Dungeon Master--

00:38:25.535 --> 00:38:28.538
(cheering)

00:38:28.538 --> 00:38:37.338
NICK: As both the Dungeon Master and a player, and
I've been working with my players in both settings

00:38:37.338 --> 00:38:43.949
to try and create narrative and story in both
environments, and I was wondering, how do you as a

00:38:43.949 --> 00:38:49.516
Dungeon Master, with Laura and the rest of them,
create the narrative? Is it mostly they write

00:38:49.516 --> 00:38:54.166
their backstory and you take it and run with it,
or is there more conversation that happens later as well?

00:38:54.166 --> 00:38:58.423
MATT: It's a conversation. What usually will
happen is I'll give a little bit of the setting to

00:38:58.423 --> 00:39:02.605
the players beforehand; I'll write up an e-mail that
talks about the general-- the landscape they're

00:39:02.615 --> 00:39:06.779
going to be starting in, some basic information
about a few locations and some of the political

00:39:06.779 --> 00:39:13.257
structure that exists there, any possible faction
tensions that exist, and then the players from

00:39:13.257 --> 00:39:17.646
there will ask me a few questions about their
character idea. I'll answer those questions, then

00:39:17.646 --> 00:39:22.146
they'll write me a character backstory based on
the information I gave them. Then, from there,

00:39:22.146 --> 00:39:26.474
I'll talk to them and be like, "Okay, this is
really cool. This part doesn't quite work with the

00:39:26.474 --> 00:39:30.008
"way this thing works here. Is it possible we can
change it a little bit to work this way?" And they'll

00:39:30.008 --> 00:39:33.667
be like, "Okay, you know what? Yeah, that works
out pretty well." And so we'll have-- it's a

00:39:33.667 --> 00:39:36.525
conversation. Because you don't necessarily want
the players to completely narrate the entire

00:39:36.525 --> 00:39:40.015
direction of your narrative, because they want
some surprises as well, but you also don't want to

00:39:40.015 --> 00:39:43.296
completely overtake it to where they don't feel
like their character stories are their own,

00:39:43.296 --> 00:39:47.612
either. So for me, at least, I prefer to have a
conversation about it, a little back-and-forth,

00:39:47.612 --> 00:39:49.126
and then you run with it.

00:39:49.126 --> 00:39:51.523
NICK: Can I tack on to that real quick?

00:39:51.523 --> 00:39:52.895
MATT: Real quick.

00:39:52.895 --> 00:39:56.576
NICK: Does that conversation continue later on,
like halfway through the arc?

00:39:56.576 --> 00:40:00.990
MATT: Yeah, it does. I'd say if the player has
anything they want to bring up, or something about

00:40:00.990 --> 00:40:04.198
their past they've come up with an idea about they
want to convey, they'll shoot me an e-mail or a

00:40:04.198 --> 00:40:07.638
text and be like, "Hey, I was thinking about this.
Could we incorporate something like this?" And

00:40:07.638 --> 00:40:12.026
I'll be like, "Sure!" or like, "Eh, it might not
fit for this," or, "We've already met this

00:40:12.026 --> 00:40:17.154
"character and it contradicts this other element of
the story," but they're welcome to do that. I know

00:40:17.154 --> 00:40:22.521
Sam has done that a number of times, been like,
"So, I had this idea about Scanlan's thing here."

00:40:22.521 --> 00:40:27.255
His whole year in Ank'harel was a back-and-forth
with him in a lead-up to the recent story

00:40:27.255 --> 00:40:32.406
elements, so it's been kind of fun. But, like,
time jumps. Right before we started streaming, we

00:40:32.406 --> 00:40:37.314
had a six-month, seven-month gap in the game's
story, in which all the players then told me what

00:40:37.314 --> 00:40:41.496
they wanted to do over that, and adjust any
elements of their backstory or what has

00:40:41.496 --> 00:40:45.664
transitioned in that time that would affect them
going forward. So yeah, you can find points in the

00:40:45.664 --> 00:40:53.345
story; be open to it. Just let players know that,
you know, your word is law. (laughs) Awesome, thank you.

00:40:53.345 --> 00:40:55.555
GABE: Hey, I'm Gabe.

00:40:55.555 --> 00:40:58.700
MATT: Hey, what's your name? Gabe, pleasure, buddy.

00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:04.134
GABE: Yeah, I actually just moved down here from
Pittsburgh about a year ago to Austin, Texas. I

00:41:04.201 --> 00:41:09.236
never got to play tabletops in high school, but I
met awesome friends, and we'd play Dungeons and

00:41:09.236 --> 00:41:13.164
Dragons, Pathfinder, this anime tabletop called
Big Eyes, Small Mouth.

00:41:13.164 --> 00:41:14.783
MATT: Yes, I've heard of that!

00:41:14.783 --> 00:41:21.148
GABE: So my big thing is, okay, I'm going to be a DM
this time. I want to jump into it, and so I make

00:41:21.148 --> 00:41:26.354
ideas on the side, I'm like, I'm going to
incorporate that story into here. And I want to

00:41:26.354 --> 00:41:30.875
get more familiar with my players' characters, and
help them with theirs, so I'm trying to prepare

00:41:30.875 --> 00:41:36.566
ideas and questions, like, "How did you wrong
someone in the past?" or "What is your perceived

00:41:36.566 --> 00:41:42.446
"purpose in life?" To both give me a better idea of
their character and help them get a better idea of

00:41:42.446 --> 00:41:45.276
theirs. So what kind of questions do you think
you'd ask them?

00:41:45.276 --> 00:41:51.816
MATT: Good question. Those are great questions to
ask, there. "Are your parents dead? Yes or no?

00:41:51.816 --> 00:42:02.845
"Circle one." But don't leave the "no". Just leave
the "yes". Okay. Wonderful, thank you. We're going

00:42:02.845 --> 00:42:04.735
to extend the panel 30 minutes so we can get
through the rest of you.

00:42:04.735 --> 00:42:08.008
(cheering)

00:42:08.008 --> 00:42:09.835
MATT: Thank you, A-Kon.

00:42:09.835 --> 00:42:12.676
AUDIENCE: Thank you, A-Kon!

00:42:12.676 --> 00:42:25.407
MATT: But yeah. Other questions involve, "What
deep fear drives your character? What's a major

00:42:25.407 --> 00:42:29.059
"and secondary goal of your character at this point
in their life?" Not overall, because goals, as we

00:42:29.059 --> 00:42:32.367
all know, change pretty quickly based on what
happens in your life. So like, at this moment,

00:42:32.367 --> 00:42:37.649
when it starts, what's your major and secondary
goal? Asking questions about, "Do you have any

00:42:37.649 --> 00:42:44.043
"existing prejudices against any factions in the
world? Any political figures?" Anything that you

00:42:44.043 --> 00:42:49.837
can use to mess with them if they ever encounter this
one lord that may have wronged their family long

00:42:49.837 --> 00:42:56.499
ago. You don't have to get too deep. A really,
really good game, for reference, that has a great

00:42:56.499 --> 00:43:01.318
questionnaire, is the game Dread. Part of the
game's structure-- the game is built literally on

00:43:01.318 --> 00:43:05.498
just sending a questionnaire to the players, and
then getting the answers back, and then you get to

00:43:05.498 --> 00:43:08.858
build the narrative off that. So it's a good place
to look for reference as well.

00:43:08.858 --> 00:43:13.498
GABE: To add to the prejudice, we have a guy whose
character only kills elves.

00:43:13.498 --> 00:43:16.409
(laughter)

00:43:16.409 --> 00:43:19.208
MATT: So you'd say your character would be... He
Who Hunts Elves?

00:43:19.208 --> 00:43:22.992
(laughter)

00:43:22.992 --> 00:43:29.673
MATT: His name is Squeegee. No wonder he hates
elves. Elves probably hate him because his name is Squeegee.

00:43:29.673 --> 00:43:33.028
(laughter)

00:43:33.028 --> 00:43:39.857
MATT: That's pretty awesome. Good question. Oh,
and I would also say, if you're having a hard time

00:43:39.857 --> 00:43:43.509
getting information out of your players, if you
really want them to provide you with some

00:43:43.509 --> 00:43:49.818
backstory-- and it happens a lot, they'll lag
behind. I had to drag information out of my

00:43:49.818 --> 00:43:53.570
players tooth and nail to get things because they
hadn't played D&amp;D before. Getting a backstory out

00:43:53.570 --> 00:44:00.576
of Sam was, at the very beginning, hard.
Incentivize them. "Hey, guys, we're all starting

00:44:00.576 --> 00:44:05.488
"at level two. However, if you send me a backstory,
you start with a bonus 500 experience points." Or,

00:44:05.488 --> 00:44:09.497
"You start with a bonus common magical item."
Players-- you'll be surprised how quickly they'll get

00:44:09.497 --> 00:44:11.709
you a really well-written backstory.

00:44:11.709 --> 00:44:14.031
(laughter)

00:44:14.031 --> 00:44:17.002
MATT: And then if they all turn it in, then, "Oh
look, you guys all started with it, so you're all

00:44:17.052 --> 00:44:21.685
"still at the same level. There's not really a
benefit to it." I mean, there is a benefit, but

00:44:21.763 --> 00:44:28.434
there is no-- "Ha-hah! I have one more item than
the rest of you because I did my homework." Yeah,

00:44:28.434 --> 00:44:33.341
small incentives can be a really good way to try
and help goad your players to take the time and

00:44:33.341 --> 00:44:36.883
think. Because even if they don't write a
backstory, some people who don't have a lot of

00:44:36.883 --> 00:44:42.386
roleplaying experience might have a hard time
finding how to get into character. And just

00:44:42.386 --> 00:44:45.555
sitting down and thinking about a backstory,
thinking about a character's motivation, and

00:44:45.555 --> 00:44:50.323
writing just a page of information about that
character, is an exercise in character-building,

00:44:50.323 --> 00:44:55.613
that when they do go to the game, they'll have a
much stronger connection with this character and a

00:44:55.613 --> 00:45:00.793
much easier way of stepping into their shoes and
thinking how they think. So I recommend it if you

00:45:00.793 --> 00:45:04.324
have the opportunity. Even if it's just a small
bit of information. If that's the kind of game you

00:45:04.324 --> 00:45:06.613
want to run. Hello, sir!

00:45:06.613 --> 00:45:08.022
CHRIS: Hello, father.

00:45:08.022 --> 00:45:10.913
(laughter)

00:45:10.913 --> 00:45:12.334
MATT: Well-played.

00:45:12.334 --> 00:45:18.455
CHRIS: Seriously, though. My name is Chris. Good
to have you again this year at A-Kon. My question

00:45:18.455 --> 00:45:24.492
is this: I want you to name your top three
hilarious moments-- not "We are gods," because

00:45:24.492 --> 00:45:31.143
that was most recent, because we all know that
one-- but try to name your top three most

00:45:31.143 --> 00:45:35.823
hilarious moments from the top of your head, if
you can, from Critical Role.

00:45:35.823 --> 00:45:37.743
MATT: From Critical Role, oh, man.

00:45:37.743 --> 00:45:42.442
AUDIENCE: Cows.

00:45:42.442 --> 00:45:44.452
MATT: The cow-mouflage moment was pretty
great.

00:45:44.452 --> 00:45:46.536
(cheering)

00:45:46.586 --> 00:45:54.124
MATT: Like, with the right combination of spells
in D&amp;D, it gets weird real fast. So having a bunch

00:45:54.124 --> 00:46:01.043
of people with the-- what the fuck's the name of
the spell called again? Seeming! I'm like, it's

00:46:01.043 --> 00:46:05.033
not Sending, that's a different spell. With the
Seeming spell, turning them all into illusory

00:46:05.033 --> 00:46:12.902
cows, and then flight spell to chase after a roc,
so you have a bunch of flying cows of different

00:46:12.902 --> 00:46:23.535
sizes just coasting across the moonlight like some
weird E.T. parody was pretty great. I mean, any

00:46:23.535 --> 00:46:30.734
time Sam kills somebody with Vicious Mockery is
pretty great. One of my favorite moments of the

00:46:30.734 --> 00:46:33.964
game still was early in the series, when they were
attacking the Emberhold, and they were trying to

00:46:33.964 --> 00:46:39.944
do it stealthily, and all of a sudden, Sam grabs
Pike and they Dimension Door up to the top of the

00:46:39.944 --> 00:46:44.252
hold, where there are a couple of these duergar
that are watching guard. And I think he does a

00:46:44.252 --> 00:46:48.864
Thunderwave spell or something that knocks them
off the side. One of them lands into the lava

00:46:48.864 --> 00:46:54.593
below and impacts and is screaming, and Keyleth's
right there, and she goes, "No, no! Shh, shh." And

00:46:54.593 --> 00:47:00.712
uses her wind to push him faster into the lava as
he's screaming. He's like, (screams). She's like,

00:47:00.712 --> 00:47:03.282
"No, no, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, shh, shh."

00:47:03.282 --> 00:47:08.173
(laughter)

00:47:08.173 --> 00:47:13.529
MATT: It was such a horrible, wonderful
quintessential Keyleth moment. It was beautiful.

00:47:13.529 --> 00:47:24.363
And, really, any time Grog decides to handle the
negotiation of any purchase. A man who relishes in

00:47:24.363 --> 00:47:30.593
having terrible math skills and ends up walking
back with less items and less money is a

00:47:30.593 --> 00:47:35.817
wonderful, wonderful experience. Good question,
thank you. You, sir.

00:47:35.817 --> 00:47:38.044
MAC: Hi, sir. My name is Mac.

00:47:38.044 --> 00:47:39.232
MATT: Hey, Mac.

00:47:39.232 --> 00:47:44.148
MAC: I was going to congratulate you on your 100th
episode, but as an insomniac, I think I'll just

00:47:44.148 --> 00:47:46.230
congratulate you on a full night of sleep.

00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:48.764
MATT: (laughs) Thank you. Very appreciated.

00:47:48.764 --> 00:47:54.192
MAC: You have expressed some frustration with your
players because you're a human being and they are

00:47:54.192 --> 00:48:01.771
them. So, with this being the last arc-- I don't
think that's too spoilery. I was wondering if

00:48:01.771 --> 00:48:06.189
there's some things you're looking forward to
being gotten rid of, whether it's bartering over

00:48:06.189 --> 00:48:11.716
Druidcraft or some random item that has the word
"hand cone" in it. Anything you'll be glad to see

00:48:11.716 --> 00:48:13.828
the last of, because it can't all be good.

00:48:13.828 --> 00:48:17.956
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Things that DMs have the list for
when changing.

00:48:17.956 --> 00:48:24.697
MATT: You know, here's the thing: you can totally
tweak anything you put in your game you think is

00:48:24.697 --> 00:48:27.973
overbalanced. And things that are super
overbalanced I'll tweak a little bit. There's

00:48:27.973 --> 00:48:33.199
certain items that have been around for a very
long time that might rhyme with Boots of Paste

00:48:33.199 --> 00:48:39.039
that could probably use a tweak. However, they've
been used so long for a certain way that it's my

00:48:39.039 --> 00:48:42.681
fault for not thinking ahead of that or understanding
the rule system at the time well enough when I

00:48:42.702 --> 00:48:45.930
designed it. So I'm letting it stand. However,
when the campaign's over, all those items are

00:48:45.930 --> 00:48:49.410
wiped away and everything's going to be new and
fresh and better-balanced.

00:48:49.410 --> 00:48:52.000
(laughter)

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.570
MATT: So, to quote Victor, (Victor voice) learn
from my mistakes!

00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:57.792
(cheering)

00:48:57.792 --> 00:49:03.110
MATT: And that's the thing about the show.
Critical Role, it's not a paragon of D&amp;D. It's not

00:49:03.110 --> 00:49:10.101
an incredible sports-level professional-- we are
all just tumbling our way through the game at all

00:49:10.101 --> 00:49:14.240
times. We do some things pretty well, we do some
things okay, and we do some things really poorly,

00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:18.699
and that's any D&amp;D game. We're not trying to
represent the best version of it. We're just

00:49:18.699 --> 00:49:23.600
playing our game and hoping that you'll watch and
embrace the things that happen really well and

00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:27.431
notice the things that don't go very well and be
like, "Cool, avoid that in the future when I run

00:49:27.431 --> 00:49:33.590
"my games," you know? And that's the best I could
hope for. So that's a good example. As far as the

00:49:33.590 --> 00:49:39.650
last arc goes, I'm looking forward to a number of
story bits that are coming forward, and I'm

00:49:39.650 --> 00:49:45.971
looking forward to the party realizing that agency
is going to be an important part of this arc, and

00:49:45.971 --> 00:49:52.069
you can't take a long rest after every encounter
or you might show up to places and everything's

00:49:52.069 --> 00:49:53.688
already happened.

00:49:53.688 --> 00:49:59.274
(cheering)

00:49:59.274 --> 00:50:00.341
MATT: Hello, sir.

00:50:00.341 --> 00:50:01.443
DAVID: Hi, I'm David.

00:50:01.443 --> 00:50:02.611
MATT: Hey, David.

00:50:02.611 --> 00:50:08.262
DAVID: I'll keep this brief. Specifically in terms
of combat situations, how do you design each

00:50:08.262 --> 00:50:13.983
encounter or scenario so that it's fresh and your
players never figure out your standard routine and

00:50:13.983 --> 00:50:15.864
keep them on their toes.

00:50:15.864 --> 00:50:21.851
MATT: That's something that even I am still
learning as we go. To me, the key to making a

00:50:21.851 --> 00:50:31.211
unique combat encounter is, one, providing
creatures or antagonists in a scenario that have

00:50:31.211 --> 00:50:35.120
varying abilities than what they're used to. It's
cool to occasionally throw in some creatures that

00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:40.251
they know before, so they can use their player
knowledge to that advantage. Not every fight in

00:50:40.251 --> 00:50:45.832
D&amp;D is meant to be a drag-down
to-the-end-of-the-line life-or-death situation.

00:50:45.832 --> 00:50:52.802
Otherwise boss fights aren't that impactful, and
conversely, players get tired. If every battle is

00:50:52.802 --> 00:50:57.081
super exhausting, you're just going to wear them
out. And you want players to enjoy the fact that

00:50:57.081 --> 00:51:01.551
they've worked hard to gain this power, and learn
these abilities, and sometimes you want to throw

00:51:01.551 --> 00:51:05.841
them a battle that they're just going to steamroll
and be like, "Haha, I am a god damn hero!" And

00:51:05.841 --> 00:51:09.772
you're like, "Yes, you are, good job!" Because then you
can use that hubris when they get to the next encounter.

00:51:09.772 --> 00:51:13.269
(laughter)

00:51:13.269 --> 00:51:16.960
MATT: So to make combat encounters interesting, if
it's a certain creature you really like but you

00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:21.120
feel like they're missing some unique tool, like
if you have a lot of party members, add an

00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:25.015
ability that's an AOE effect. You can change
anything that's in the books, you can alter

00:51:25.015 --> 00:51:28.865
anything that's in the books and make it your own.
Sometimes I use creatures unchanged out of the

00:51:28.865 --> 00:51:32.473
book, sometimes I alter them dramatically or
create new ones entirely. You have that within

00:51:32.473 --> 00:51:36.404
your power as a Dungeon Master, because it's
whatever you want it to be. So come up with

00:51:36.404 --> 00:51:41.124
creative ways that the enemies can attack or alter
or shift the battlefield, pushing things away,

00:51:41.124 --> 00:51:46.512
restraining them where they stand, throwing them
up against the wall and locking them there, making

00:51:46.512 --> 00:51:53.294
ravines or areas of the battlefield that are
themselves challenges in the terrain that not are

00:51:53.294 --> 00:51:57.510
just pitfalls, but the enemy intelligently--
if they are an intelligent enemy-- can use to their favor.

00:51:57.510 --> 00:52:02.029
What happens if a creature grabs a party member
and throws them off a cliff? Harpies are not that

00:52:02.029 --> 00:52:06.988
powerful, but I added a rule to harpies in my
game-- though they've bypassed them almost every

00:52:06.988 --> 00:52:14.144
time they've been there. High-level magic makes it
real interesting to try and do random encounters,

00:52:14.144 --> 00:52:19.339
sometimes. But I gave the harpies an ability where
they have an attack type where they can grapple

00:52:19.339 --> 00:52:23.590
somebody and then move them at half-speed if they
don't break the grapple. Which is really great at

00:52:23.590 --> 00:52:29.349
mountainsides. All of a sudden, this low-hitpoint
harpy is a real issue. It's like, "Well, my only

00:52:29.349 --> 00:52:35.071
"attack's 17 damage, but if I drop you 1,000 feet,
(chuckles). You're no longer a god."

00:52:35.071 --> 00:52:39.980
(laughter)

00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:44.271
MATT: Also, consider the encounter sometimes, if
there's a narrative reason for it especially, come

00:52:44.271 --> 00:52:49.819
up with ways that there are non-combat-specific
challenges in the battlefield. Imagine a boss that

00:52:49.819 --> 00:52:54.858
has captured a number of villagers and locked them
within a sphere of magic, and the longer they're

00:52:54.858 --> 00:52:57.979
in there, it's draining their life force. So the
players not only have to defeat the creature, but

00:52:57.979 --> 00:53:02.943
they have to try and find a way to take down this
sphere, and the more combat rounds that go by, the

00:53:02.943 --> 00:53:07.417
more members of these villagers start withering and dying.
So now it's like, "Do I attack the boss or do I

00:53:07.417 --> 00:53:11.938
"start trying to find ways to shut down this
field?" Maybe there's hidden elements of this

00:53:11.938 --> 00:53:15.730
magical construction that they have to go and now
destroy the different parts, and they have to

00:53:15.730 --> 00:53:19.437
choose or split up. Do you distract the boss while
we go do this, or do we not care about the

00:53:19.437 --> 00:53:23.329
villagers and just go after the boss, but now have
to go back to town and deal with the fact that we

00:53:23.329 --> 00:53:27.838
didn't save a lot of people? Come up with unique
ways to not just have moral quandaries, but to

00:53:27.838 --> 00:53:32.747
challenge what they consider a combat encounter
is. Every now and then you want to have a hitpoint

00:53:32.747 --> 00:53:37.339
just rush-in-and-kill-shit-type fight, but you
want to try and mix it up every now and then and

00:53:37.339 --> 00:53:42.140
make them think. I can go on a long discussion
about this, and there's only so much I can even

00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:47.410
teach on that. Matt Colville has some great videos
on YouTube you can check out. I know Adam Koebel--

00:53:47.410 --> 00:53:51.269
Colville, Koebel, those are interesting names--
has done a lot of great games with some

00:53:51.269 --> 00:53:56.658
interesting combat techniques. High Rollers over
in the U.K., Mark does some great stuff too. So

00:53:56.658 --> 00:54:00.828
you can look in at some of their forums, some of
their Reddit threads and ask them on Twitter, for

00:54:00.828 --> 00:54:05.610
some suggestions, too, and they can
probably help you out. Good! Hello!

00:54:05.643 --> 00:54:08.369
SKY: Hi! My name's Sky.

00:54:08.369 --> 00:54:09.839
MATT: Hey, Sky!

00:54:09.839 --> 00:54:20.369
SKY: I'm starting a new Pathfinder campaign of my
own very soon, my first one, and I was wondering

00:54:20.369 --> 00:54:27.508
if you had any advice for a relatively new GM who
is pretty confident in the roleplaying and story

00:54:27.508 --> 00:54:34.859
aspect, but not so much in the balancing
encounters and either accidentally everything's a

00:54:34.859 --> 00:54:40.523
super-easy combat encounter that they can all just
rush through, or the boss kills them all?

00:54:40.523 --> 00:54:47.368
MATT: You learn-- I would say start easy, then
rank up. It's much better to have a party

00:54:47.368 --> 00:54:52.588
steamroll an encounter, and then you can scale the
difficulty from experience and trial and error as

00:54:52.588 --> 00:54:56.149
you go, than it is to have the first encounter
just wipe everyone out. And you're like, "Well,

00:54:56.149 --> 00:55:01.287
"that was fun. Do you guys want to come back next
week? No? Okay, bye." So definitely err on

00:55:01.287 --> 00:55:06.641
starting the easier side, and then learn from
those encounters, "Okay, that guy got killed way

00:55:06.641 --> 00:55:11.460
"too fast, so he wasn't doing enough damage to be a
threat. Next encounter, I'll up those sets of

00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:16.139
"elements." Or add an ability that might shut down
one of their spellcastings shortly. Or what if an

00:55:16.139 --> 00:55:19.777
enemy has part of the terrain that drops a
portcullis and they all have crossbows? So the

00:55:19.777 --> 00:55:22.799
party has to find a way to get past that gate
while they're being shot full of bolts that they

00:55:22.799 --> 00:55:29.052
can't find a way to avoid. You learn from
experience. I can tell you right now, the first

00:55:29.052 --> 00:55:37.230
three years I ran D&amp;D out of high school, those
games were awful. It was so bad! Because I didn't

00:55:37.230 --> 00:55:41.611
have any basis of reference. I just had the books,
and whatever I thought might work, and so we

00:55:41.611 --> 00:55:47.588
didn't know any better, and by then we were like,
"This seems fine." Flaming room? "This is fine."

00:55:47.588 --> 00:55:53.959
With the cup. That was my early D&amp;D. We didn't know
any better. So don't be too worried about having

00:55:53.959 --> 00:55:58.770
to get it right out of the gate. You'll learn,
you'll come up with some great and ingenious

00:55:58.770 --> 00:56:02.450
moments, some things won't quite live up to the
expectations you'd hoped. Learn from those and

00:56:02.450 --> 00:56:07.190
adjust as you go forward. And also, my other big
advice for a new-time DM: you don't have to

00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:13.599
over-prepare one single thing. If you spend so
much time putting out all the details of one small

00:56:13.599 --> 00:56:17.571
aspect of the story, what happens if the players
five minutes in go, "We're going to go this way."

00:56:17.571 --> 00:56:27.924
"Wh--" Which will happen, because that's part of
the joy of D&amp;D. Part of the rush of being a Game

00:56:27.924 --> 00:56:32.478
Master is when that happens. I would recommend,
instead of fleshing out a lot of detail on a small

00:56:32.478 --> 00:56:37.717
area, flesh out a fair amount of detail about a
number of them. 'Cause if they do go left, maybe

00:56:37.717 --> 00:56:41.279
there's a little tiny thing you put some
afterthought to, and a little development here

00:56:41.279 --> 00:56:46.029
that you can then tailor to cover that left turn.
And you'll feel a lot more comfortable having a

00:56:46.029 --> 00:56:49.918
loose outline that then you can improvise from on
the fly. Especially if you're really good at

00:56:49.918 --> 00:56:55.109
narrative and storytelling, that's great, because
then the ruleset will handle itself and the players

00:56:55.109 --> 00:56:59.399
will also work with you on that, and you'll learn
as you go. But if you overprepare one single

00:56:59.399 --> 00:57:03.849
thing, you'll end up getting real nervous when
they don't go where you think they will. 'Cause

00:57:03.849 --> 00:57:05.432
they won't, 'cause players do that.

00:57:05.432 --> 00:57:07.007
(laughter)

00:57:07.007 --> 00:57:08.330
MATT: Good luck, that's awesome!

00:57:08.330 --> 00:57:12.776
(applause)

00:57:12.776 --> 00:57:13.808
MATT: Hello!

00:57:13.808 --> 00:57:19.118
GLORIA: Hello! I'm Gloria. I just recently
graduated with a history major and an English

00:57:19.118 --> 00:57:20.306
minor--

00:57:20.306 --> 00:57:21.519
MATT: Congrats!

00:57:21.574 --> 00:57:23.986
(cheering)

00:57:23.986 --> 00:57:27.267
GLORIA: If it taught me anything, it's that words
are important and absolutely everything has a

00:57:27.267 --> 00:57:30.972
story. So your two signature catch-phrases: "how do
you want to do this?" and "you can certainly

00:57:30.972 --> 00:57:34.502
"try!", where did those come from?

00:57:34.502 --> 00:57:40.092
MATT: Those came from just playing the game. "You
can certainly try" came out of me not ever wanting

00:57:40.092 --> 00:57:44.670
to shut down a player. A player's like-- you're
like, "All of a sudden, you come upon the edge of

00:57:44.670 --> 00:57:48.443
"the hallway, and you look, and the cliff just
drops off, there's just an empty expanse." The

00:57:48.443 --> 00:57:54.862
player's like, "Well, uh, can I climb down the
rock?" And sometimes, especially if you're a new

00:57:54.862 --> 00:57:58.983
DM, you'd be like, "No, you can't, you're going to
fall and die." Which mainly to me shuts off that

00:57:58.983 --> 00:58:03.431
creative aspect of the player wanting to think of
creative ways of solving a problem. You instead

00:58:03.431 --> 00:58:13.331
can prefer to go, "Well, you can certainly try."
Which makes them go, "Hm. I don't-- why are you

00:58:13.331 --> 00:58:18.842
"saying it like that?" But then they still might
want to explore it and be like-- because now

00:58:18.842 --> 00:58:22.451
you've given them a hint of an idea that it might
be possible, which then will lead them to explore

00:58:22.451 --> 00:58:26.604
more. Like, "Okay, well, I look over the side. How
jagged is the rock in the crevasse below?" And be

00:58:26.604 --> 00:58:30.433
like, "Actually, it's fairly smooth in places, but
roll a perception check. Okay, you notice that

00:58:30.433 --> 00:58:34.252
"there are a few outcroppings that could probably
be climbed, if you want to try and attempt it."

00:58:34.252 --> 00:58:37.511
He's like, "Okay, guys. Who has some ropes?"
Suddenly it went from a "No" to "All right, guys,

00:58:37.511 --> 00:58:41.111
"that's not going to work," to "Now we have a
possible plan. How can we as a team come together

00:58:41.111 --> 00:58:46.037
"with our skills and equipment and make this work?"
And so, for me, "You can certainly try" is an

00:58:46.037 --> 00:58:50.951
invitation to a possibility without shutting down
the player's creativity. And I think part of the

00:58:50.951 --> 00:58:55.581
real joy of D&amp;D, especially as a Game Master, is
providing situations where the players can surprise

00:58:55.581 --> 00:58:59.322
you with their ingenuity, and themselves
appreciate some of the things that they brought

00:58:59.322 --> 00:59:02.942
along or chose with their character class but
don't get to use very often, and find a way to

00:59:02.942 --> 00:59:07.418
circumvent a challenge using them. So, to me,
"You can certainly try" is that fine line between

00:59:07.418 --> 00:59:15.457
saying, "I mean, you <i>could</i>." And then "How do
you want to do this?" for years, it was just like,

00:59:15.457 --> 00:59:19.647
"All right, you got the final kill. Describe the
final kill." And then eventually it got to, "All

00:59:19.647 --> 00:59:25.244
"right, you got him, describe it to me. All right,
how do you want to kill them? How do you want to

00:59:25.244 --> 00:59:28.626
"do this?" It was just a natural evolution after
years of me running games at home, and then "How

00:59:28.626 --> 00:59:32.137
"do you want to do this?" for some reason just had
a nice ring to it, and the players began to

00:59:32.137 --> 00:59:36.256
celebrate that phrase. It became its own little
catch-phrase at our home games. I mean, say, "How

00:59:36.256 --> 00:59:41.326
"do you want to kill him," it's less of a banner
or... a t-shirt, as--

00:59:41.326 --> 00:59:43.492
(laughter)

00:59:43.492 --> 00:59:46.359
MATT: So it evolved into that, and then once we
got into "How do you want to do this?" it had

00:59:46.359 --> 00:59:50.533
that, "Yes! Okay. Here's what I do: I cut his
throat and grab his hair and tell him, as he

00:59:50.533 --> 00:59:53.468
"slowly bleeds out and his eyes go numb, 'Say hi to
your mother for me.'"

00:59:53.468 --> 00:59:55.168
(laughter)

00:59:55.168 --> 01:00:02.199
MATT: It became that much more of an underlying
invitation for that cinematic moment, so it just

01:00:02.199 --> 01:00:07.578
stuck, and then unintentionally passed it on to
all you guys, so I'm a proud papa.

01:00:07.618 --> 01:00:10.918
(cheering)

01:00:10.918 --> 01:00:12.389
MATT: Thank you.

01:00:12.389 --> 01:00:13.758
SARAH: Hello, again.

01:00:13.758 --> 01:00:16.897
MATT: Hello, again! Which, by the way, every time
I see your camera it makes me think of the

01:00:16.897 --> 01:00:18.388
Predator arm cannon.

01:00:18.388 --> 01:00:19.517
SARAH: I know, I love it.

01:00:19.517 --> 01:00:20.658
MATT: It's kind of awesome.

01:00:20.827 --> 01:00:26.492
SARAH: My name's Sarah. At the autograph signing,
I thanked you. I kind of want to go into a little

01:00:26.492 --> 01:00:34.302
bit more detail. I came from one of the satanic
panic families, so my first experience with D&amp;D

01:00:34.302 --> 01:00:41.768
was extremely lame, with a rulemonger, and you
have no idea. I can't speak for everybody in the

01:00:41.768 --> 01:00:46.928
community, but you have no idea how nice it is to
see a DM who isn't killing the players with the

01:00:47.416 --> 01:00:54.461
rules, and to know that my style of DM isn't
actually weird. So thank you very much for that.

01:00:54.461 --> 01:00:55.855
MATT: You're welcome.

01:00:55.855 --> 01:00:58.404
(applause)

01:00:58.404 --> 01:01:03.439
SARAH: My actual question is, can I get a
soundbite of Victor for my phone?

01:01:03.439 --> 01:01:06.427
(laughter)

01:01:06.427 --> 01:01:10.558
MATT: Let's see. What soundbite do you want? I
don't want to encourage this;

01:01:10.558 --> 01:01:12.724
this will end up being 
the rest of the panel, guys.

01:01:12.724 --> 01:01:14.509
(laughter)

01:01:14.509 --> 01:01:16.944
SARAH: You're well within your rights to say no.

01:01:16.944 --> 01:01:18.377
MATT: Is that the quote you want?

01:01:18.377 --> 01:01:19.682
SARAH: Sure. That's perfect.

01:01:20.152 --> 01:01:24.927
MATT: Ready? (Victor voice) You are well 
within your rights to say no!

01:01:24.992 --> 01:01:26.502
(laughter)

01:01:26.658 --> 01:01:27.845
SARAH: Thank you!

01:01:27.845 --> 01:01:29.989
(cheering)

01:01:29.989 --> 01:01:34.717
MATT: I had to get the spittle in there. It was
part of the process. Sorry, table. And let it be

01:01:34.717 --> 01:01:40.957
known, too, that running a really hardcore D&amp;D
game where it is trying to destroy the players,

01:01:40.957 --> 01:01:46.216
Dark Souls-level super-hard mode, is totally a fun
and viable way of running the game, too. Just make

01:01:46.225 --> 01:01:49.777
sure you communicate that with the players and
everyone understands that's what you're in for.

01:01:50.052 --> 01:01:53.419
Because if they don't, and they wanted a different
style of game, that's where it becomes a very

01:01:53.419 --> 01:01:57.594
un-fun, frustrating circumstance. But if you're
all down for that type of gameplay? It's actually

01:01:57.598 --> 01:02:01.462
really cool. Awesome. Sir, what's your name?

01:02:01.462 --> 01:02:06.583
ARTHUR: This is wonderfully weird after seeing you
on the screen for a while. Hi, I'm Arthur.

01:02:06.583 --> 01:02:08.232
MATT: Is it any better if I did this?

01:02:08.232 --> 01:02:09.845
(laughter)

01:02:09.865 --> 01:02:12.155
ARTHUR: Basically, I'd just sit like this the
entire time.

01:02:12.315 --> 01:02:15.485
MATT: Not anymore, based on the new set, baby. I
can stand again!

01:02:15.493 --> 01:02:17.524
(cheering)

01:02:17.524 --> 01:02:18.606
ARTHUR: The power!

01:02:18.606 --> 01:02:23.358
MATT: It's overwhelming. (Hearthstone
voice) Power overwhelming. Sorry.

01:02:23.378 --> 01:02:28.938
ARTHUR: I just came from a game, actually, and I
have many a complicated new question to ask you,

01:02:29.443 --> 01:02:33.989
but because this just happened to me, I have to
ask this. I Taliesined my first game with my other

01:02:33.989 --> 01:02:39.412
DM just now, and I want to know, how tired are you
of Taliesin Percying?

01:02:39.412 --> 01:02:46.642
MATT: (laughs) His rolls? I can't say I'm tired,
because it makes for really cool moments. If it

01:02:46.642 --> 01:02:52.892
was a really lame character that was like, "Well,
yeah, I'm a fighter, and I wander the world for

01:02:52.892 --> 01:02:57.173
power because my parents are dead and I want magic
weapons," and then he rolled 20s all the time, I'd

01:02:57.173 --> 01:03:03.973
be a little like, "Come on, man, you can't
Gameshark this shit." But Percival's such a cool

01:03:03.973 --> 01:03:10.867
character, and it is witchcraft that he rolls as
well as he does.

01:03:10.867 --> 01:03:12.326
ARTHUR: He is beating math.

01:03:12.326 --> 01:03:17.590
MATT: He is! He's the anti-Wheaton. But nothing
will blow my mind more than Wil Wheaton's stint on

01:03:17.590 --> 01:03:23.525
the show. That was... like, mathematicians left
the field after that night. They were like, "Nope.

01:03:23.525 --> 01:03:30.802
We're done. Probability has no purpose. We are
rocketing towards the entropic heat death of the

01:03:30.802 --> 01:03:38.559
universe. Thank you, Wil Wheaton." So it doesn't
frustrate me. It just means I have to work harder

01:03:38.559 --> 01:03:45.998
to kill him. (laughs) Exactly. Or like, "What else
can I do to give him disadvantage all the time?"

01:03:45.998 --> 01:03:47.832
ARTHUR: Puns!

01:03:47.832 --> 01:03:55.221
MATT: Puns. Puns will work. I can't combat his
puns. Taliesin-- I said this to a few friends last

01:03:55.221 --> 01:04:01.457
night. You know the Dos Equis Most Interesting Man
in the World commercials? That should be Taliesin.

01:04:01.457 --> 01:04:06.487
He is the most fascinating human being I've ever
known. I've known him for a long time, and he is

01:04:06.487 --> 01:04:14.293
just an eclectic, interesting man of all realms of
life experience and strange, occult world

01:04:14.293 --> 01:04:21.723
knowledge. He is the closest thing I have to a
modern-day shaman. It's amazing. So yeah. I think

01:04:21.723 --> 01:04:26.482
he's earned those 20s when he hits stuff. The
man's probably done enough rituals in his teen

01:04:26.482 --> 01:04:27.815
years to make it so.

01:04:27.815 --> 01:04:30.183
(laughter)

01:04:31.175 --> 01:04:35.018
MATT: Awesome. All right, yeah, so we've got 30
more minutes, guys. We can do this.

01:04:35.041 --> 01:04:38.266
MICHAEL: Hi! My name's Michael. You're honestly
one of my idols. Never thought I'd get to talk to

01:04:40.358 --> 01:04:42.379
you like this. I was poor two days, didn't think
I'd be able to make it tonight.

01:04:42.379 --> 01:04:44.026
MATT: Oh, I'm glad you could make it!

01:04:44.026 --> 01:04:48.859
MICHAEL: So two questions. One's a little bit more
on the serious side, the other's just kind of-- I

01:04:48.859 --> 01:04:53.843
want to know your opinion on it. First, with all
the satanic panic and all the witch hunts for D&amp;D

01:04:53.843 --> 01:05:00.086
back in the day, what really was the driving force
for that? Because I hear a lot of different

01:05:00.086 --> 01:05:02.904
conflicting things, you know, Darkest Dungeons,
things like that?

01:05:02.904 --> 01:05:07.250
MATT: The driving force for a lot of things like
that are the same reason people are blaming video

01:05:07.250 --> 01:05:15.029
games for violence. There are some individuals
that might be causes, but I think whenever youth--

01:05:15.679 --> 01:05:24.633
whether it be through untreated mental illness or
parents ignoring a difficulty that someone's going

01:05:24.633 --> 01:05:29.751
through in the teenage years, which is a very
difficult time for anybody, as many of us know, or

01:05:29.751 --> 01:05:33.632
currently know in the moment. It's not an easy
time. A lot of chemical changes, a lot of physical

01:05:33.632 --> 01:05:38.501
changes, a lot of very, very difficult social
structures, in school and outside. It's a very

01:05:38.501 --> 01:05:46.677
hard time. And sometimes people do terrible
things. And if a parent isn't paying attention, if

01:05:46.677 --> 01:05:50.486
a parent isn't involved, if the parent doesn't
want to take any responsibility for that?

01:05:50.486 --> 01:05:55.321
Sometimes they want to look for what else there is
to blame. And so I think a lot of stems from

01:05:55.409 --> 01:06:01.742
people that wanted to find other excuses for
unfortunate behavior. They wanted to take

01:06:01.767 --> 01:06:05.403
responsibility for the fact that "Maybe I wasn't
there for my child, maybe I didn't inquire or care

01:06:05.501 --> 01:06:09.776
why they were lashing out. Maybe I got too busy
with work and didn't want to deal with the stress

01:06:09.776 --> 01:06:15.332
of wondering why they were so quiet and not
contacting or communicating, and maybe I need

01:06:15.332 --> 01:06:21.217
to really reevaluate if I was being a good parent or
not." Instead: "They were playing D&amp;D! It's D&amp;D's

01:06:21.217 --> 01:06:22.558
fault!"

01:06:22.571 --> 01:06:26.341
MICHAEL: The wacky tobaccy's Dungeons &amp; Dragons.
My second question: if you had to pick any other

01:06:26.450 --> 01:06:31.266
system, not D&amp;D or Pathfinder-based, to run the
players that are in the current group through,

01:06:31.338 --> 01:06:35.525
what would you pick? Out of all the systems out
there, what was your favorite preferred kind of

01:06:35.525 --> 01:06:36.762
system?

01:06:36.762 --> 01:06:38.089
MATT: To introduce somebody?

01:06:38.259 --> 01:06:41.200
MICHAEL: Little bit of column A, little bit of
column B. Is introducing someone something you

01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:42.528
just enjoy doing?

01:06:42.648 --> 01:06:48.396
MATT: Both. I mean, I really like 5th Edition. I
think of all the D&amp;D editions, it's the easiest to

01:06:48.754 --> 01:06:55.144
understand, comparably. I look at my 2nd Edition,
THAC0, no thank you. Trying to introduce stats to

01:06:55.144 --> 01:07:01.102
kids nowadays is going to be a rough one. It has a
place in my heart, but esoteric math is a

01:07:01.102 --> 01:07:08.818
difficult thing to introduce to new people. For
those who don't know THAC0, look it up. But I

01:07:08.818 --> 01:07:13.117
think that 5th Edition is good way of weaving
narrative and roleplaying context into combat

01:07:13.117 --> 01:07:17.975
rules without them being two separate parts of the
system. Advantage and disadvantage works both

01:07:17.975 --> 01:07:22.625
skill checks and combat. Abilities that can affect
one sometimes affect the other. It's

01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:26.670
simplified and streamlined to the point where it's
not quite as intimidating for people who have no

01:07:26.670 --> 01:07:32.645
roleplaying game experience. If they're really
new, Dungeon World is an even simpler system

01:07:32.645 --> 01:07:36.642
that's been really good that helps bring people
into it and give them the idea of roleplaying

01:07:36.642 --> 01:07:45.684
without having even as complicated a ruleset as
D&amp;D 5th Edition has. I think the Fate Core system

01:07:45.684 --> 01:07:50.785
is actually really, really good, too. It has a
good scaling system for success and failure. Those

01:07:50.785 --> 01:07:56.340
are all really good places to look, in my opinion.
I like them all. I enjoy them all. Yay! You're

01:07:56.340 --> 01:07:58.662
welcome. Hello!

01:07:58.826 --> 01:08:04.203
NATHAN: Hey! So I was wondering. As a DM, do you
ever just get really, really mad at your players,

01:08:04.203 --> 01:08:10.517
and how do you deal with that? Do you maybe make a
really, really hard encounter? How do you reward

01:08:10.517 --> 01:08:14.302
them if they actually come above that?

01:08:14.302 --> 01:08:18.910
MATT: Do you mean angry about how good they're
doing in the game, or angry at them personally for

01:08:18.910 --> 01:08:20.062
what they're doing?

01:08:20.062 --> 01:08:21.029
NATHAN: Maybe a little bit of both.

01:08:21.029 --> 01:08:29.375
MATT: Okay. (laughs) Sometimes. Human beings will
have conflict, and even when you're friends there

01:08:29.375 --> 01:08:34.444
will be moments of tension, in a game environment
or outside of it. It's unavoidable. There's always

01:08:34.444 --> 01:08:37.287
going to be dissonance occasionally between human
beings, no matter how much you care about each

01:08:37.287 --> 01:08:42.757
other. I've had many games in the past, before
Critical Role, where certain players were either

01:08:42.757 --> 01:08:47.450
having a bad day and lashing out at the
group, or a new player to a game didn't jive

01:08:47.450 --> 01:08:50.743
with the rest of the way we wanted to play the
game, and instead was taking over and ruining the

01:08:50.743 --> 01:08:54.416
experience for other people for their own power
trip, and in a lot of those circumstances, you

01:08:54.416 --> 01:08:58.177
have to take the player aside and talk to
them, and let them know. The moment it starts

01:08:58.192 --> 01:09:01.744
getting weird, be like, "All right, guys, let's
take a quick break. Bathroom, get snacks. Hey,

01:09:01.744 --> 01:09:05.276
let's talk for a second." And take them aside
and be like, "Hey, I'm feeling this weird

01:09:05.276 --> 01:09:10.998
tension," or, "The way you're playing-- is
everything okay?" Don't be afraid to engage and

01:09:11.037 --> 01:09:16.619
ask what might be the reason for that going on.
And sometimes they might be like, "Actually, yeah,

01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:20.338
my girlfriend just broke up with me," or "I just
found out that a friend of mine is sick." Or they

01:09:20.338 --> 01:09:25.278
could be like, "No, man, I don't want to talk
about feelings, whatever." Then maybe they don't

01:09:25.283 --> 01:09:30.236
belong at your game table. (laughs) But having a
conversation and just opening up that much might

01:09:30.237 --> 01:09:34.119
help them feel better and work through whatever
they're going through at the table, or help you

01:09:34.126 --> 01:09:38.132
realize that they need to find a game group that's
more their speed. Just because everyone shows up

01:09:38.132 --> 01:09:42.306
at the table doesn't mean you're all forced to
play together. It's better to divide if you're not

01:09:42.306 --> 01:09:48.495
jiving and both find game groups that work for you
than to try and make it work in spite of it.

01:09:48.495 --> 01:09:55.245
So that conversation helps a lot. I've had players
that got really, really drunk at games, and ended

01:09:55.245 --> 01:09:59.123
up disrupting it, after repeatedly asking them not
to do that, and then eventually had to tell them,

01:09:59.123 --> 01:10:03.687
"Sorry, can't play anymore,. You're not respecting
the time and energy we're all putting into this to

01:10:03.687 --> 01:10:07.493
schedule it, and the time I'm putting in to
prepare for it," and they were like, "Okay, I get

01:10:07.493 --> 01:10:13.505
it." Usually when it gets really bad they'll
understand that. It's not an easy thing, and it

01:10:13.505 --> 01:10:17.840
does happen occasionally, but being forthright
and being open, asking about it and seeing

01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:21.496
what you can do to come to a compromise,
and if there isn't a way to do so, you think, then

01:10:21.512 --> 01:10:25.056
just go your separate ways. That's my
recommendation. Thank you!

01:10:25.056 --> 01:10:27.654
COLIN: Hi, I'm Colin.

01:10:27.654 --> 01:10:28.978
MATT: What's your name, sorry?

01:10:28.978 --> 01:10:29.626
COLIN: Colin.

01:10:29.626 --> 01:10:33.222
MATT: Colin. And by the way, I didn't get your
name. What's your name? Nathan! There you go.

01:10:33.222 --> 01:10:35.174
Thank you, Nathan. Hi, Colin.

01:10:35.174 --> 01:10:40.786
COLIN: So whether it's from someone who influenced
you in your life or your own thoughts, what was

01:10:41.027 --> 01:10:49.564
your biggest "A-ha!" or epiphany moment in regards
to how you think about DMing or how you act as a DM?

01:10:49.564 --> 01:11:01.480
MATT: That's a good question. Huh. I think-- oh
man, that's a really interesting question. I

01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:08.437
hadn't really thought about that specifically. I
would say that a lot of it is learning from other

01:11:08.437 --> 01:11:13.157
friends I've played with. Things that I really
liked about their games. My friends like Jason

01:11:13.167 --> 01:11:18.646
Bender and Sean Manzano, who I used to play games
with back in the mid-2000s, they were-- Jason was

01:11:18.649 --> 01:11:26.289
a game designer, Sean worked in QA, and they were
both not the kind of people who necessarily had a

01:11:26.289 --> 01:11:28.410
theatrical flair, you would expect, but when they
got to the table, they were so invested in their

01:11:28.410 --> 01:11:34.158
story that they still managed to show glimmers of
this great narrative flair to the way they would

01:11:34.158 --> 01:11:38.071
tell the story, and I really enjoyed that. They
reflected what I wanted out of my games. And I was

01:11:38.071 --> 01:11:44.489
getting heavily into community theater and improv,
I loved the idea of storytelling and then asking

01:11:44.491 --> 01:11:48.195
others to return it, and so at the same time that
I was enjoying these games with my friends that

01:11:48.299 --> 01:11:54.507
they were running, and games that I was running
for them, I was also honing my skills specifically

01:11:54.507 --> 01:12:01.964
in that field of inviting others to add to a
narrative, and to describe verbally scenes to get

01:12:01.964 --> 01:12:07.790
an audience's attention, and so those skills
came together at the same time, when I found

01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:12.134
it was hard to get people to engage in D&amp;D,
especially actors and performers. That was another

01:12:12.134 --> 01:12:14.867
thing, too, was that as the years went on, a lot
of my friends ended up becoming actors that I was

01:12:14.867 --> 01:12:18.047
trying to get into D&amp;D. A lot of conversations--
which I'm sure many of you are familiar with,

01:12:18.047 --> 01:12:21.411
where someone will bring it up at a party or a
get-together and be like, "I never-- you play

01:12:21.411 --> 01:12:28.148
Dungeons and Dragons? How does that work?" And I'm
always like, "Oh, that's an invitation to suck you

01:12:28.148 --> 01:12:33.289
in, my friend." So I began to drag friends
into it, and ask people, "Well, if you're not busy

01:12:33.289 --> 01:12:36.442
next Friday, come over. I'll run a one-shot for
you guys. First one's free!"

01:12:36.442 --> 01:12:39.188
(laughter)

01:12:39.188 --> 01:12:45.289
MATT: And so that, I think, had a lot of influence
on me learning it over time. As far as

01:12:45.289 --> 01:12:53.555
specific people, bookwriters like Neil Gaiman and
his incredible, intricate character narrative

01:12:53.555 --> 01:13:02.211
and setting a scene and unique spins on existing
lore and mythology. As far as combat sequences? A

01:13:02.211 --> 01:13:08.215
lot of anime. What am I going to say? The Exalted
RPG is basically just Anime: the RPG, and that was

01:13:08.215 --> 01:13:15.327
fun for a while, too. I don't know of any
specific people, because when I was learning to

01:13:15.327 --> 01:13:20.564
DM, there wasn't other figures that DMed
publically. There wasn't a Chris Perkins that I

01:13:20.564 --> 01:13:26.738
could look at and be like, "Master, teach me." So
we were all learning in a vacuum. So it

01:13:26.738 --> 01:13:31.814
was a combination of skills that I was learning at
the time and learning what I liked from other

01:13:31.814 --> 01:13:36.678
people I'd played with and over time
fine-tuning what I really got enjoyment out of,

01:13:36.678 --> 01:13:41.192
and was able to extract from the players. Thank
you! Hope that answered it somewhat.

01:13:41.192 --> 01:13:50.223
TAYLOR: Hi, I'm Taylor, and my friends and I, who
I play with, we're a big fan of you and we get our

01:13:50.223 --> 01:13:56.210
groups together partially in idolization of you,
but we go from coast to coast, all at college, we

01:13:56.210 --> 01:14:00.262
get on Skype and we play for six hours a day,
somehow managing to get all across the time zones.

01:14:00.262 --> 01:14:05.617
We do a lot of sci-fi RPGs, so I wanted to ask:
what's your favorite sci-fi system?

01:14:05.617 --> 01:14:10.061
MATT: Oh, man. I really enjoy Traveler.

01:14:10.061 --> 01:14:11.634
TAYLOR: I'm doing that right now.

01:14:11.634 --> 01:14:15.465
MATT: Good, good! It's a great system! One of the
few systems where you can die in character creation.

01:14:15.465 --> 01:14:19.424
(laughter)

01:14:19.424 --> 01:14:23.789
MATT: Because it's cool. As you create your
character, you basically work out their arc of how

01:14:23.789 --> 01:14:27.874
they grew up and how they developed, so you can be
like, "Well, I can play that plucky young

01:14:27.874 --> 01:14:31.676
20-something who's new and trying to make his name
in the world," and that's cool, so you can start

01:14:31.676 --> 01:14:36.385
as a Mercenary, you're a 20-something Mercenary.
So you get the skills of a 20-year-old Mercenary.

01:14:36.385 --> 01:14:40.935
"But if I want to be a more hardened criminal in
his late 40s," then you can go from that

01:14:40.935 --> 01:14:45.297
Mercenary, but once that work led him into a
darker field, then he began to break the law and

01:14:45.297 --> 01:14:49.326
do more criminal smuggling, so now you go for the
Smuggler set, which adds more skill bonuses to

01:14:49.326 --> 01:14:53.628
you, but you're a little older, so you get some
penalties for age, some benefits to your wisdom

01:14:53.628 --> 01:14:59.827
for age, and you're like, "Cool, 45. But if I take
him to a 55-year-old drug lord who's run from the

01:14:59.827 --> 01:15:04.016
smuggling ring-- Okay, let me roll randomly.
Aww, he got killed in a firefight."

01:15:04.016 --> 01:15:06.064
(laughter)

01:15:06.064 --> 01:15:09.569
MATT: "We'll start the run again." That's a
possibility in the system! So it's like,

01:15:09.569 --> 01:15:13.382
do you want to risk pushing the envelope a bit
with that dangerous lifestyle for those extra

01:15:13.382 --> 01:15:17.579
little skill bonuses? And I love that aspect of
it. But that's a really, really cool system that

01:15:17.579 --> 01:15:23.913
very much plays into that pseudo-Star Wars,
more Firefly-esque-type universe.

01:15:23.913 --> 01:15:32.410
Little Space Balls-ish, if you want to. Yeah,
Traveler's fun. Diaspora's fun. Diaspora's a good

01:15:32.410 --> 01:15:35.876
system. I ran a game-- didn't run a game, I played
in a game for a while that was run by a guy named

01:15:35.876 --> 01:15:43.020
Philip. He was the writer of the movie Event
Horizon. So he ran a pretty good sci-fi/horror game.

01:15:43.020 --> 01:15:45.699
(laughter)

01:15:45.699 --> 01:15:54.960
MATT: Guy had some issues in the best way. If you
haven't seen Event Horizon, well, don't eat before

01:15:54.960 --> 01:16:00.383
you do. Yeah, so those are great sci-fi games. I
haven't had a lot of experience with a lot of the

01:16:00.383 --> 01:16:04.162
more recent ones, because I've been stuck in D&amp;D
world for a long time, because that's where

01:16:04.178 --> 01:16:07.550
my heart is, but those two I enjoy a lot,
tremendously. And actually, I hear a lot of good

01:16:07.559 --> 01:16:09.929
things about the new Star Wars RPG.

01:16:09.929 --> 01:16:11.794
(cheering)

01:16:11.794 --> 01:16:15.614
MATT: Most recent one. There was a Fate version
for a while that I heard was really good.

01:16:15.614 --> 01:16:17.564
TAYLOR: I played Edge of the Empire.

01:16:17.564 --> 01:16:21.554
MATT: Right, that was good, too. I haven't played
it yet, haven't had the opportunity. I know a

01:16:21.554 --> 01:16:27.166
couple friends who've been threatening to one day
run that for me, and I'm like, "Sure. In my

01:16:27.166 --> 01:16:35.600
copious free time. Let me finish the campaign
guide first." So thank you very much. Hello!

01:16:35.610 --> 01:16:37.966
TRUSTIN: Hi. I'm Trustin.

01:16:37.966 --> 01:16:39.410
MATT: Hi, Justin.

01:16:39.410 --> 01:16:40.228
TRUSTIN: Trustin.

01:16:40.228 --> 01:16:41.872
MATT: I trust in you.

01:16:41.872 --> 01:16:45.199
(laughter)

01:16:45.199 --> 01:16:49.359
MATT: I'm sorry, that came out so-- I knew it as
it was happening, it was awful, my sincere apology.

01:16:49.623 --> 01:17:01.693
TRUSTIN: It's okay. It's just every day in my
life. Okay, so I actually started D&amp;D only a

01:17:01.693 --> 01:17:09.263
couple months ago with my brother. He's DMing,
he's back there somewhere.

01:17:09.263 --> 01:17:10.930
MATT: Oh, yes!

01:17:10.930 --> 01:17:25.042
TRUSTIN: So. I have two questions. First one is
just: I'm trying to make this character that's a

01:17:25.042 --> 01:17:36.207
super destruction-happy, fun-fun, kill-kill type of
character, very much based off of Jinx or Harley Quinn.

01:17:36.207 --> 01:17:37.176
MATT: Okay, yeah, yeah.

01:17:37.176 --> 01:17:46.028
TRUSTIN: Just take some joy in causing as much
panic and fear and stuff. I was wondering what

01:17:46.028 --> 01:17:48.984
sort of class you might recommend for that?

01:17:48.984 --> 01:17:56.713
MATT: Oh, man. Well, talk to your group. Make sure
that they know the kind of character you're making

01:17:56.713 --> 01:18:01.817
so that you don't end up bringing that to the
table with a lawful good paladin. Because that

01:18:01.817 --> 01:18:04.681
might be a very short campaign, for you or them.

01:18:04.681 --> 01:18:06.820
TRUSTIN: I don't know, I feel like it could be
fun.

01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:12.523
MATT: It could be interesting. Just be aware, it
might be a very short, fun campaign. But if you're

01:18:12.523 --> 01:18:18.270
all playing sort of a Suicide Squad-type,
whatever-it-takes-to-get-the-job-done group, then

01:18:18.270 --> 01:18:26.370
it can be a lot of fun and rampant destruction.
And in that case, I mean, barbarian, man. You're

01:18:26.370 --> 01:18:32.844
just an engine of up-front destruction. Yes!
(laughs) It's a class designed to be like,

01:18:32.844 --> 01:18:36.928
"Oh, that? I want to kill it. I want to kill it in
the face with my face."

01:18:36.928 --> 01:18:39.496
(laughter)

01:18:39.496 --> 01:18:42.772
MATT: So barbarian's great, but then you get
multiclass into some other elements, like

01:18:42.772 --> 01:18:46.126
barbarian with some fighter classes for action
surge, as you've seen with Grog, is disgusting.

01:18:46.126 --> 01:18:54.076
Barbarian-- or if you like to tear things together
as a beast, you can take druid with a couple

01:18:54.076 --> 01:18:57.229
levels of barbarian, so you can rage and then
beast shape.

01:18:57.229 --> 01:18:59.703
(cheering)

01:18:59.703 --> 01:19:04.202
MATT: So you're like, "Oh, I'm sorry, you think
this creature's scary, this giant sabretoothed

01:19:04.202 --> 01:19:06.177
cat? How about if it takes half damage?"

01:19:06.177 --> 01:19:08.386
(laughter)

01:19:08.386 --> 01:19:14.995
MATT: But if you want-- I mean, then you also have
wizard if you want to just tear things apart, or

01:19:14.995 --> 01:19:19.632
warlock's fun, too. Warlock's a great option if
you want to be more like crazy orchestrator of

01:19:19.632 --> 01:19:26.481
death to everything around you. "And you're dead!
Hahaha! And your house is on fire! And I summon a

01:19:26.481 --> 01:19:33.307
demon beast to devour your family! (cackles)" Also
fun. So for what you're describing, I think good

01:19:33.307 --> 01:19:35.711
fits would be barbarian or warlock as a base, most
definitely.

01:19:35.711 --> 01:19:41.251
TRUSTIN: All right. The second question is
on my brother's absolute insistence.

01:19:41.251 --> 01:19:42.989
AUDIENCE MEMBER: No, you don't need to, never
mind.

01:19:42.989 --> 01:19:45.436
TRUSTIN: No, I'll do it anyway, because you forced
me to!

01:19:45.436 --> 01:19:48.068
(laughter)

01:19:48.068 --> 01:19:51.278
MATT: Go on.

01:19:51.278 --> 01:19:53.609
(laughter)

01:19:53.609 --> 01:19:57.862
TRUSTIN: He just wanted you to say, "Fuck you,
Ryuji," in Yusuke's voice.

01:19:57.862 --> 01:19:59.687
MATT: Say what in what?

01:19:59.687 --> 01:20:02.219
TRUSTIN: "Fuck you, Ryuji," in Yusuke's voice.

01:20:02.219 --> 01:20:05.780
MATT: (Yusuke voice) Fuck you, Ryuji.

01:20:05.780 --> 01:20:10.639
(laughter, applause)

01:20:10.639 --> 01:20:15.129
MATT: (Yusuke voice) Doesn't seem to like any of
the art that I make. What a bastard.

01:20:15.129 --> 01:20:17.966
(laughter)

01:20:17.966 --> 01:20:20.428
JARED: My liege, it's an honor to be in your
presence.

01:20:20.428 --> 01:20:22.175
MATT: You may rise.

01:20:22.175 --> 01:20:33.924
JARED: Thank you. Hi, I'm Jared. So I'm a panelist
and I'm a newly DM of seven months. I have ran a

01:20:33.924 --> 01:20:41.570
couple campaigns, my first one being an evil
campaign, actually. It got pretty weird.

01:20:41.570 --> 01:20:44.123
MATT: They usually do. It's okay.

01:20:44.123 --> 01:20:46.378
JARED: I mean sex dungeon weird.

01:20:46.378 --> 01:20:53.984
MATT: Okay, it doesn't usually go that way. In my
experience.

01:20:53.984 --> 01:21:00.130
JARED: There's a point to it, too. There's a point
to it. Didn't interact with it, but more like one

01:21:00.130 --> 01:21:06.267
of the characters, who was a tiefling chaotic evil
character, was not making perception checks at

01:21:06.267 --> 01:21:16.948
all, so I used it to where, when he turned around,
all of it disappeared and a huge hole appeared, a

01:21:16.948 --> 01:21:23.638
big massive monster. So yeah. Also, yeah.

01:21:23.638 --> 01:21:25.775
MATT: Go on.

01:21:25.775 --> 01:21:31.454
(laughter)

01:21:31.454 --> 01:21:38.204
JARED: So what I want to say to you about my
campaigns-- also, I've played a lot of characters.

01:21:38.204 --> 01:21:53.352
I played a character named Kyo who was a druid
half-elf mini-[inaudible]. Looked a lot like a

01:21:53.352 --> 01:22:01.664
[inaudible]. I currently play a halfling rogue
thief with a criminal background who I dumped all

01:22:01.664 --> 01:22:09.768
my points in dexterity, and stealth and sleight of
hand's at plus five. So he can't not be stealthy.

01:22:09.768 --> 01:22:19.209
But my question, my question, okay. So since I've
watched a lot of your DM Tips, which is why I got

01:22:19.254 --> 01:22:26.964
a Dungeon Master's Guide, hardcover, for fifty
bucks. I want to know, how was your campaigns--

01:22:26.975 --> 01:22:33.830
how were they like when you first started, and
what brought you to forming it into Critical Role?

01:22:34.770 --> 01:22:46.246
MATT: My very first campaigns, when I was high
school, were me, my cousin Steve, who was an elven

01:22:46.246 --> 01:22:55.751
thief mage named Natibe Kurios, who eventually
became an NPC in future games, my friend Ian, who

01:22:55.751 --> 01:23:02.156
was my buff Korean friend who just wanted to pick
a fighter that could grandmaster duel longswords

01:23:02.156 --> 01:23:08.320
and kill stuff. He was the epitome of a min-maxer,
but in a loving way. And then my friend Todd, who

01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:13.756
found an archer kit that completely broke 2nd
Edition, where he'd shoot seven arrows a

01:23:13.756 --> 01:23:19.078
round. I remember there was an encounter
where they accidentally entered the lair of an

01:23:19.293 --> 01:23:26.518
ancient blue dragon, and it was asleep, and all of
a sudden they roused it and it began to wake up,

01:23:26.518 --> 01:23:31.368
and I described as its eye opened, and he goes, "I
attack it!" And he killed it in one round, and it

01:23:31.368 --> 01:23:39.326
went like, (groans). And I went, "All right. Your
character's broken, buddy." So yeah. They were

01:23:39.326 --> 01:23:44.563
pretty rough and silly and randomly rolling-- we
were learning by trying things out and

01:23:44.563 --> 01:23:49.807
failing miserably, so. And what got me to Critical
Role? Felicia Day asking if we wanted to stream

01:23:49.807 --> 01:23:55.163
it, and us going, "Eh, I don't know," and she's
like, "But Twitch!" and I'm like, "Okay." So

01:23:55.163 --> 01:23:56.212
that's basically it.

01:23:56.212 --> 01:23:59.090
JARED: Also, I almost tricked my DM into giving me
the Deck of Many Things.

01:23:59.090 --> 01:24:01.825
MATT: Don't ever trick your-- why would you do
that?!

01:24:01.825 --> 01:24:03.708
(laughter)

01:24:03.708 --> 01:24:05.165
JARED: I love fucking with my party.

01:24:05.165 --> 01:24:07.235
MATT: Understood. Does your party like it?

01:24:07.235 --> 01:24:10.328
(laughter)

01:24:10.328 --> 01:24:15.257
MATT: Okay. As long as they're okay with it, it's
fine. (laughs) Thank you very much. Hello!

01:24:15.257 --> 01:24:17.134
ALEXIS: Hi, my name is Alexis.

01:24:17.134 --> 01:24:19.146
MATT: Hi, Alexis. You look amazing, by the way.
That's an awesome outfit.

01:24:19.146 --> 01:24:22.406
ALEXIS: Thank you! I also want to say, it's
amazing to see you again. I got to meet you two

01:24:22.406 --> 01:24:23.730
years ago at Colossalcon.

01:24:23.730 --> 01:24:28.050
MATT: Awesome! Oh, Colossalcon. By the way, guys,
if you haven't been to Colossalcon, it's got a

01:24:28.050 --> 01:24:33.239
pool inside and a swim-up bar. Come on. It's fun.
It's good to see you again.

01:24:33.239 --> 01:24:38.743
ALEXIS: I actually had a friend want me to ask you
a question, so I'm doing that for him. He wanted to

01:24:38.743 --> 01:24:44.117
know: what class did you first start out, and did you
start favoring a specific race for making characters?

01:24:44.117 --> 01:24:51.765
MATT: My first character ever was a human wizard
named Trent. Emeritus Trent, which is actually-- I

01:24:51.765 --> 01:24:56.186
took the name from the Xanth book series by Piers
Anthony, and I was like, "I want to be a wizard

01:24:56.186 --> 01:25:01.203
that uses a sword, get up in the fray!" Because I
didn't know what the hell I was doing. So I used a

01:25:01.203 --> 01:25:05.616
militant wizard kit in 2nd Edition, which
basically was the worst wizard kit ever. It

01:25:05.616 --> 01:25:08.499
basically was like, "You get no benefits, except
you can use a sword, so now you're a wizard who

01:25:08.499 --> 01:25:09.681
gets up in front and killed."

01:25:09.681 --> 01:25:11.670
(laughter)

01:25:11.670 --> 01:25:16.651
MATT: Which happened. So yeah, no. That was my
first character. It was really bad. As far as

01:25:16.651 --> 01:25:22.580
races I tend to favor while creating characters,
there's a glut of elves. Don't get me wrong, I

01:25:22.580 --> 01:25:26.390
like myself some elves, but everyone's like, "I
want to be an elf!" I want to be a dwarf. I love

01:25:26.390 --> 01:25:30.269
dwarves. Dwarves and halflings get
underrepresented, I believe. So those are my two

01:25:30.269 --> 01:25:33.682
favorite races and probably the two that I'd play
if I got to create another character. Definitely.

01:25:33.682 --> 01:25:34.848
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I'm a halfling rogue!

01:25:34.848 --> 01:25:37.805
MATT: Yeah! Represent! Halfling!

01:25:37.805 --> 01:25:39.949
(cheering)

01:25:39.949 --> 01:25:44.597
MATT: That happened. Thank you very much. Good to
see you again.

01:25:44.597 --> 01:25:45.966
AUDIENCE MEMBER: What about Volo's?

01:25:45.966 --> 01:25:52.171
MATT: What's that? Volo's is great! Yeah,
monstrous races? Go for it! Heck yeah! Aarakocra,

01:25:52.171 --> 01:25:55.849
man. Nothing a DM loves more than a player who can
fly at low level.

01:25:55.849 --> 01:25:58.475
(laughter)

01:25:58.475 --> 01:26:06.675
MATT: It's great. All right, guys, unfortunately
we're running really low on time, here. I'm going

01:26:06.675 --> 01:26:09.859
to try and get through some rapid-fire questions.
So quick questions, quick answers, and if I don't

01:26:09.926 --> 01:26:13.224
get to your questions, I sincerely apologize in
advance. See if you can bring them-- I have

01:26:13.224 --> 01:26:16.869
another panel tomorrow, I know it's not
D&amp;D-related, but I won't argue if any D&amp;D

01:26:16.869 --> 01:26:19.522
questions slip in there. Sir.

01:26:19.522 --> 01:26:26.177
JACK: Okay. Hi, I'm Jack. First off, thank you for
blessing my dice earlier. As a new DM, I will try

01:26:26.177 --> 01:26:28.666
to use my powers for good. No promises.

01:26:28.666 --> 01:26:30.219
MATT: That's like any DM should.

01:26:30.219 --> 01:26:38.318
JACK: First off, as I leave, I'd like to show you
a very quick picture related to the goldfish. So.

01:26:38.318 --> 01:26:48.042
I think you'll enjoy it. That'll be as I leave. My
question is, what was the first event after you

01:26:48.042 --> 01:26:55.283
started Twitch, what was that moment where you sat
back and realized, "Oh. This is actually a thing

01:26:55.283 --> 01:26:57.846
that is big and has followers?"

01:26:57.846 --> 01:27:04.972
MATT: I think when we began to get mass donations
to charity, to 826LA, when we began to get $100

01:27:04.972 --> 01:27:10.185
donations, $200 donations, I was like, people are
legitimately excited about supporting these

01:27:10.185 --> 01:27:13.886
charitable causes in the name of playing
roleplaying games. It was amazing. And then people

01:27:13.886 --> 01:27:19.050
were asking us to make merch, make merch. "I don't
know what that is! We'll just make 100 t-shirts

01:27:19.050 --> 01:27:22.521
and see if you want to buy them. Hey, guys! So we
put a couple t-shirts up there if you want to--

01:27:22.521 --> 01:27:23.805
they're sold out? What?"

01:27:23.805 --> 01:27:26.105
(laughter)

01:27:26.105 --> 01:27:30.679
MATT: That was when it really hit home, when we
were like, "What is going on?" Thank you, good

01:27:30.679 --> 01:27:40.680
question. You look amazing! Oh, that's an amazing
picture. Got to finish line? Okay, trying to move

01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:42.952
fast, trying to finish the line, guys. All right,
cool.

01:27:42.952 --> 01:27:49.008
JADE: My name is Jade. I'm writing my own campaign
setting, and I wanted to know, based on your own

01:27:49.008 --> 01:27:55.266
experience running and writing the guide, what's
the most unusual or unexpected thing that you've

01:27:55.266 --> 01:27:58.570
had to create that really makes the world seem
living?

01:27:58.570 --> 01:28:07.293
MATT: Oh, that's an interesting question.
Honestly, fleshing out factions-- and not just

01:28:07.293 --> 01:28:14.576
racial and city-based factions, but fleshing out
secret, small factions, trying to think of what

01:28:14.576 --> 01:28:19.266
things the players might never encounter. Thinking
about what individuals might work behind the

01:28:19.266 --> 01:28:24.838
scenes of certain areas. And considering that maybe--
this was actually pretty fun-- considering that

01:28:24.838 --> 01:28:32.067
not every major town in a fantasy setting is just
the races in the book. Because sometimes, not all

01:28:32.067 --> 01:28:39.845
gnolls might be evil. Not all orcs are marauding
killers. You can consider that a lot of creatures,

01:28:39.845 --> 01:28:45.171
based on their life experience and things, can
still engage and move into different elements of

01:28:45.171 --> 01:28:50.850
society. So whereas in this campaign, that I'm
running with our players, it's largely the classic

01:28:50.850 --> 01:28:55.008
races they've encountered, they've also not been
to a lot of cities across Tal'Dorei in which there

01:28:55.008 --> 01:29:00.239
is a little more of a robust come-one-come-all
type of environment. So that was a unique thing to

01:29:00.239 --> 01:29:02.876
develop, definitely. You look awesome!

01:29:02.876 --> 01:29:09.798
JACKSON: Get the mic to a place where I can
actually talk. Hi. I'm Jackson. I'm one of the DMs

01:29:09.798 --> 01:29:17.243
from Dungeon Crawl Gaming, and I've made a Legend
of Zelda-themed campaign, and to do that I had to

01:29:17.243 --> 01:29:22.266
rewrite the entire Races section of the Player's
Handbook, because there aren't orcs in Hyrule, but

01:29:22.266 --> 01:29:28.328
one of the things that I found very challenging
was to incorporate how a goron rolls. And so what

01:29:28.328 --> 01:29:34.197
I was thinking, have there ever been things from a
video game or from media that work really well in

01:29:34.197 --> 01:29:39.799
that, and you've tried to translate to D&amp;D and it
didn't quite work? What did you do in those scenarios?

01:29:39.799 --> 01:29:46.047
MATT: I mean, there are elements of what
eventually became the blood hunter that stemmed

01:29:46.047 --> 01:29:51.884
from inspiration of the classic witch hunter classes
and the Witcher game that are like, "Cool, if I

01:29:51.884 --> 01:29:55.838
can make something like that in here," and then
as I begin to try and print it out, it was hard to

01:29:55.838 --> 01:30:00.271
tailor the rules, and I decided to make it
something wholly new and my own. So that

01:30:00.271 --> 01:30:04.575
particularly was hard. Back in the day,
I remember very early in my D&amp;D career,

01:30:04.575 --> 01:30:08.922
helping my friend make Ryu as a D&amp;D character,
because he really wanted to play Ryu in D&amp;D.

01:30:08.922 --> 01:30:10.248
We were so dumb.

01:30:10.248 --> 01:30:12.215
(laughter)

01:30:12.215 --> 01:30:17.115
MATT: And it was so broken and stupid, and after a
game we went, "No, that was-- no. No Ryu in D&amp;D.

01:30:17.115 --> 01:30:20.870
Sorry, man." So yeah. That happens. (laughs) Thank
you.

01:30:20.870 --> 01:31:08.868
