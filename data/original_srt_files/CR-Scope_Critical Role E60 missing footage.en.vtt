NOTE Paragraph

00:00:06.023 --> 00:00:07.528
LIAM: Come here. Give me a hug.

00:00:09.488 --> 00:00:13.107
MATT: She looks to her mom, looks to you. “Are you
a warrior?”

00:00:14.497 --> 00:00:15.407
LIAM: Sort of.

00:00:15.512 --> 00:00:17.812
(laughter)

00:00:18.257 --> 00:00:24.506
MATT: She gives you a very judging glance. “Okay!”
She runs up and gives you a hug.

00:00:24.726 --> 00:00:27.837
LIAM: I scoop her up and I turn her away from her
mom and I bring her into a hug.

00:00:29.517 --> 00:00:32.275
LAURA: Hello, dear! Are you still wearing that
necklace I gave you?

00:00:32.275 --> 00:00:34.729
MATT: “Yes!” She pulls it out and shows it.

00:00:35.509 --> 00:00:41.656
LAURA: Oh, you’re wonderful! How are they treating
you? Is it wonderful here? Do you hate it?

00:00:41.656 --> 00:00:45.979
MATT: “It’s boring! There’s nothing to do here!
They won’t let us leave the city!”

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:49.606
LAURA: I completely understand. You need to talk
to your father into going back.

00:00:49.606 --> 00:00:51.656
MATT: “He won’t listen to anyone!”

00:00:51.656 --> 00:00:53.824
TALIESIN: Why won’t they let you leave the city, dear?

00:00:53.824 --> 00:00:58.588
MATT: “Because it’s dangerous and they’re almost
ready for the war, they said.”

00:00:58.588 --> 00:00:59.347
TALIESIN: Did they?

00:00:59.347 --> 00:01:00.208
SAM: What? Oh.

00:01:01.758 --> 00:01:03.239
TALIESIN: Are you going to fight, dear?

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:15.277
MATT: Devana scolds, “My dear, Velora, let’s leave
that discussion for when your father comes.” You

00:01:15.277 --> 00:01:23.827
hear a voice across the room say, “Then I suppose
it’s time to discuss.” Everyone glances over and

00:01:23.827 --> 00:01:29.979
on the far edge of the room, coming out of what
you assume is his study, the door partially open,

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:38.717
the familiar long, black hair, pale complexion,
stern look you grew up with. The man before you is

00:01:38.717 --> 00:01:40.488
the elven ambassador from Syngorn to Emon.

00:01:40.488 --> 00:01:44.619
LUCAS: Matt? We got to stop. We had a program
freeze.

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:45.186
MATT: Oh no!

00:01:45.186 --> 00:01:47.398
LUCAS: Everybody, this is typical. You know how it
goes.

00:01:48.688 --> 00:01:50.266
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Just like the real thing!

00:01:50.266 --> 00:01:53.786
(laughter)

00:01:54.266 --> 00:01:55.827
LAURA: Did anybody bring a hula-hoop?

00:01:58.757 --> 00:01:59.748
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I brought dice!

00:01:59.748 --> 00:02:01.944
LUCAS: [inaudible]

00:02:02.203 --> 00:02:02.983
MATT: Two minutes.

00:02:02.983 --> 00:02:09.492
LUCAS: [inaudible]

00:02:09.492 --> 00:02:10.463
LAURA: Oh shit, did--

00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:12.044
MARISHA: This was a huge reveal.

00:02:12.044 --> 00:02:13.723
LIAM: Good thing it was a such a throw-away
moment.

00:02:13.723 --> 00:02:16.493
(laughter)

00:02:16.493 --> 00:02:17.834
TRAVIS: How about we kill the kid?

00:02:17.834 --> 00:02:22.484
(laughter, cheers)

00:02:22.484 --> 00:02:24.645
MARISHA: Don’t worry, they’ll all blame it on me.

00:02:26.505 --> 00:02:29.528
TALIESIN: Put her in the Pokeball and throw her
out.

00:02:30.738 --> 00:02:41.139
TRAVIS: We could put water all over our faces and
act like somebody died! Who’s it going to be? Who

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:41.798
wants to die?

00:02:46.508 --> 00:02:48.071
TALIESIN: I’ll rochambeau you for it.

00:02:48.071 --> 00:02:49.709
MARISHA: That’ll be completely fair.

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.559
TRAVIS: Paladin of the Raven Queen.

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:54.007
MATT: Let us know when we’re ready again.

00:02:55.737 --> 00:02:57.431
SAM: Oh, well, if we’re stalling.

00:02:57.431 --> 00:02:58.729
CREW: 30 seconds.

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:01.948
LAURA: No, wait! What? Stall.

00:03:03.228 --> 00:03:04.538
SAM: We’re back in 30 seconds; forget it.

00:03:04.538 --> 00:03:05.589
TALIESIN: What were you going to say?

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:06.559
LAURA: What were you going to do?

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:07.899
SAM: I was going to give the audience a present.

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:11.738
(gasping and cheering)

00:03:12.968 --> 00:03:13.988
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I love you, Sam.

00:03:13.988 --> 00:03:15.690
SAM: But it sounds like we’re about to go.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:16.729
MATT: We’re about to go.

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:18.929
AUDIENCE MEMBER: No, hold off! It’s funny.

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:23.430
LIAM: The next malfunction will be in 15 minutes.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.459
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You get a carpet, and you get a
carpet.

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.720
MATT: Do we have that part recorded for Monday, at
least?

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.138
LUCAS: What’s that?

00:03:30.138 --> 00:03:34.781
MATT: Do we have the footage recorded? Do we have
that footage recorded for the Monday episode, at least?

00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:36.742
LUCAS: Yes, and when we get it, we’ll mash them
together.

00:03:36.742 --> 00:03:38.861
MATT: Great, that’s what we wanted.

00:03:41.521 --> 00:03:42.331
MARISHA: Yeah, we can--

00:03:42.471 --> 00:03:44.590
MATT: [inaudible]

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:48.299
MARISHA: If this would have happened with Anton
back in the day: Fix it in post.

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:51.619
SAM: We have time?

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.221
CREW: I’m going to count you guys down. Here we
go.

00:03:54.221 --> 00:03:54.733
LAURA: Okay.

00:03:55.493 --> 00:03:57.139
CREW: Let me confirm that the stream is up.

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:00.791
LIAM: Stop watching them work!

00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:02.480
(laughter)

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:07.730
TRAVIS: [inaudible] I love it.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.710
CREW: All right, here we go. Going live in five,
four--

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:13.799
LIAM: Naga nipples!

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:15.581
LAURA: Titty twist!

00:04:16.691 --> 00:04:19.490
MATT: Welcome back! Sorry about that!

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:21.471
(cheering)

00:04:21.471 --> 00:04:22.549
SAM: What a battle!

00:04:22.709 --> 00:04:27.522
MATT: The technical aspects. We’re working through
it, but we got through it. Thank you for your

00:04:27.522 --> 00:04:34.411
patience. The last few minutes, we’re not quite
sure how much you may have missed, but the party

00:04:34.411 --> 00:04:39.999
wiped. We’re rolling up new characters. No, for
the Monday episode, we’ll make sure to splice in

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:43.620
anything that may have been missed for the past
minute. The party had come to the home of Syldor,

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:51.490
father of Vax and Vex. They had a brief discussion
with Devana, his new wife. They were given tea

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:59.530
after introductions and briefly discussed the
merits of being a warrior with their half-sister

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:06.459
Velora Vessar. After discussing a war of some
kind, Syldor made his way into the room. You see

00:05:06.459 --> 00:05:13.521
the long, dark hair of Syldor, his pale
complexion, his stern face staring back at you all

00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:16.139
within the doorway as he closes it behind him.

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:17.060


99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
