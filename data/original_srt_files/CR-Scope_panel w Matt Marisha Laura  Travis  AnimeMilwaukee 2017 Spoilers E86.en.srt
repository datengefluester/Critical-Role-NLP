1
00:00:10,835 --> 00:00:28,083
(cheering)

2
00:00:28,122 --> 00:00:30,681
LAURA: Look at Percy!

3
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:36,734
MARISHA: We miss you guys!

4
00:00:36,734 --> 00:00:39,638
TRAVIS: We miss you too, man! I like your shirt!

5
00:00:39,638 --> 00:00:41,536
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thanks!

6
00:00:41,536 --> 00:00:43,847
(laughter)

7
00:00:43,847 --> 00:00:51,056
MATT: All righty!

8
00:00:51,056 --> 00:00:54,682
LAURA: Can you hear us if we talk?

9
00:00:54,682 --> 00:00:56,127
MATT: Yeah, we can hear you.

10
00:00:56,127 --> 00:00:59,126
AUDIENCE: Yeah! (cheering)

11
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:03,228
MARISHA: Here, look! We'll break reality. Look at
yourself!

12
00:01:03,228 --> 00:01:05,246
LAURA: Are we big?

13
00:01:05,246 --> 00:01:17,676
(laughter)

14
00:01:17,676 --> 00:01:26,902
MATT: All right! So we don't keep them glued to
their computer for too long, we'll go ahead and

15
00:01:26,902 --> 00:01:29,779
start this panel off, which, by the way, is a
Critical Role panel. Hi everybody!

16
00:01:29,779 --> 00:01:34,461
(cheering)

17
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:36,950
MATT: Thank you for coming. We're a bunch of
nerdy-ass voice actors who play Dungeons and

18
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:44,476
Dragons. We have of course the delightful and
gorgeous Marisha Ray.

19
00:01:44,476 --> 00:01:51,281
(cheering)

20
00:01:51,281 --> 00:02:01,565
MATT: Joining us via satellite, we have the
awesome and joyous, beautiful Laura Bailey.

21
00:02:01,565 --> 00:02:06,523
(cheering)

22
00:02:06,523 --> 00:02:12,346
MATT: Then we have the luxurious, beautiful,
gorgeous Travis Willingham.

23
00:02:12,346 --> 00:02:20,257
(cheering)

24
00:02:20,257 --> 00:02:22,637
MATT: Yeah, you got to look at the audience. Much
better.

25
00:02:22,637 --> 00:02:24,597
LAURA: Although I love staring at you two.

26
00:02:24,597 --> 00:02:36,495
MATT: There you go. So yes, welcome, I'm Matt. I
do a thing.

27
00:02:36,495 --> 00:02:40,519
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You do an amazing thing!

28
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:47,236
MATT: Oh, thank you! So, to begin this panel, I'm
curious, how many here have not watched Critical

29
00:02:47,236 --> 00:02:51,392
Role? Oh, you're going to be <i>real</i> confused.

30
00:02:51,392 --> 00:02:55,052
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Spoilers!

31
00:02:55,052 --> 00:02:56,900
LAURA: So confused.

32
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:01,837
MATT: Hopefully the person dressed as Scanlan is
not the confused person.

33
00:03:01,837 --> 00:03:04,466
(laughter)

34
00:03:04,466 --> 00:03:07,988
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I am so confused at this point.

35
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:11,796
MATT: Maybe this is true. I would ask also, please
any questions or statements you have, no spoilers.

36
00:03:11,796 --> 00:03:16,306
Many people are at different places in the
storyline, so be careful about things you ask or

37
00:03:16,306 --> 00:03:19,614
say, to make sure as to not spoil it for anybody.
Thank you.

38
00:03:19,614 --> 00:03:21,353
TRAVIS: Whatever. All the characters are dead!

39
00:03:21,353 --> 00:03:23,859
(laughter)

40
00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:30,585
MATT: Damn it, Travis. That being the case, I would
say, first and foremost, if you have any burning

41
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:35,612
questions for our fantastic dynamic duo over in
Los Angeles right now, go ahead and raise your

42
00:03:35,612 --> 00:03:39,139
hand, and we'll go ahead and call-- right there in
the front row!

43
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:44,896
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We just started a new campaign
and we're doing evil satires, and in this

44
00:03:44,896 --> 00:03:53,476
campaign, you're kind of on the good side. I
decided to do chaotic neutral. What are some good

45
00:03:53,476 --> 00:03:55,366
tips to go in on that?

46
00:03:55,366 --> 00:03:58,146
(laughter)

47
00:03:58,146 --> 00:04:00,112
MARISHA: Tips for being chaotic neutral?

48
00:04:00,112 --> 00:04:01,127
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah.

49
00:04:01,127 --> 00:04:02,927
MARISHA: Yeah, Travis, take it away!

50
00:04:02,927 --> 00:04:04,546
(laughter)

51
00:04:04,546 --> 00:04:10,540
TRAVIS: I would <i>love</i> chaotic neutral. For me, it
is the class that lets you be your most impulsive.

52
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,710
LAURA: Sorry, I was just thinking about the
lights, that's all, keep going.

53
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:17,691
(laughter)

54
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:21,424
TRAVIS: I love chaotic neutral because you get to
be impulsive and there's not a lot of things that

55
00:04:21,424 --> 00:04:26,995
fall outside of your alignment as long as it makes
some sort of rational or impulsive sense for your

56
00:04:26,995 --> 00:04:33,306
character. I love chaotic neutral, and if you ever
feel like you need to start doing things along a

57
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:39,136
more good alignment, or evil alignment, I'm sure
you can change as you go along, but damn, chaotic

58
00:04:39,136 --> 00:04:41,547
neutral's the way to start, believe you me.

59
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:46,246
MATT: Good question.

60
00:04:46,246 --> 00:04:47,857
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.

61
00:04:47,857 --> 00:04:51,298
MATT: Laura, do you have anything to add since you
had a brief foray with chaotic neutral?

62
00:04:51,298 --> 00:04:54,176
LAURA: (laughs) Am I not still chaotic neutral?

63
00:04:54,176 --> 00:04:57,687
MATT: I think you've make it back to chaotic
good.

64
00:04:57,687 --> 00:04:59,775
LAURA: Spoiler!

65
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:03,069
(laughter)

66
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:09,957
LAURA: Well, I don't know. I feel like even when
she was chaotic neutral, Vex wanted to be good.

67
00:05:09,957 --> 00:05:19,696
So I feel like I'm not really smart. Don't show
everybody. I just ate a banana.

68
00:05:19,696 --> 00:05:23,016
(laughter)

69
00:05:23,016 --> 00:05:30,998
MATT: Congratulations. Thank you, good question!
Next question, let's go over-- you, sir, with the

70
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:33,496
glasses in the back. Yeah, those glasses!

71
00:05:33,496 --> 00:05:38,797
MARISHA: Stand up, so the people on the other end
of the world can see you.

72
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,659
LAURA: Oh, hi!

73
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:46,887
AUDIENCE MEMBER: This can be extended to all of
you: what do you find is the greatest challenge in

74
00:05:46,887 --> 00:05:51,796
playing your characters and, for you Matt, what do
you find the most challenging about NPCs?

75
00:05:51,796 --> 00:05:55,775
MATT: Okay, so what do you find most challenging
about playing your characters? Laura, Travis, you

76
00:05:55,775 --> 00:05:56,998
guys first.

77
00:05:56,998 --> 00:05:58,037
LAURA: You go first.

78
00:05:58,037 --> 00:06:01,320
TRAVIS: Me first? I always find it hard to play--
it's not hard, it's actually gotten easier to play

79
00:06:01,345 --> 00:06:03,128
a character with low intelligence--

80
00:06:03,128 --> 00:06:05,618
(laughter)

81
00:06:05,618 --> 00:06:12,237
TRAVIS: It's the fun part about playing Grog--
it's like taking all the filters out of your brain

82
00:06:12,237 --> 00:06:15,825
and just reacting with the first thing that
happens to pop in there, as long as it doesn't

83
00:06:15,825 --> 00:06:22,258
offend or piss anybody off. But even then
sometimes you do it. The hardest thing is

84
00:06:22,258 --> 00:06:26,668
remembering that I can't read or that I don't know
what numbers and letters are, things like that.

85
00:06:26,668 --> 00:06:30,472
(laughter)

86
00:06:30,472 --> 00:06:40,121
LAURA: Oh man, I guess the hardest part is
actually sounding like a badass. Like I really

87
00:06:40,121 --> 00:06:45,246
want Vex to be super cool and it's not.

88
00:06:45,246 --> 00:06:51,179
MARISHA: She's super cool! Keyleth thinks she's
super cool.

89
00:06:51,179 --> 00:06:53,065
LAURA: Thanks Keyleth!

90
00:06:53,065 --> 00:06:54,396
MARISHA: Yeah man!

91
00:06:54,396 --> 00:06:55,772
TRAVIS: One liners!

92
00:06:55,772 --> 00:06:57,087
MARISHA: I think you're awesome.

93
00:06:57,087 --> 00:07:02,597
LAURA: It's hard not to trip over your words when
you're trying to sound intelligent also. Like at

94
00:07:02,597 --> 00:07:05,387
the same time because you don't know what you're
about to say, so.

95
00:07:05,387 --> 00:07:11,744
MARISHA: Yeah, that's tough. That's why we all
end up inevitably saying something stupid when

96
00:07:11,744 --> 00:07:15,595
you're trying to sound intelligent, at least once.
You repeat words.

97
00:07:15,595 --> 00:07:17,557
MATT: That's half of Dungeons and Dragons,
though.

98
00:07:17,557 --> 00:07:19,898
(laughter)

99
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:27,437
MARSHA: Yeah, kind of a similar way, just that
natural impulse because I'm radically different

100
00:07:27,437 --> 00:07:37,987
from Keyleth. Travis and I kind of have that same
kind of "let's just fuck shit up" mentality, so I

101
00:07:37,987 --> 00:07:46,295
have to stop myself sometimes and be like, "No,
Keyleth wouldn't do that. She'd be a good person,"

102
00:07:46,295 --> 00:07:49,686
so yeah.

103
00:07:49,686 --> 00:07:51,708
TRAVIS: I never have that problem.

104
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,076
(laughter)

105
00:07:53,076 --> 00:08:00,080
MARISHA: Yeah. Next character, not going to be
good! No! Tired of this moral compass shit.

106
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,321
(laughter)

107
00:08:02,321 --> 00:08:08,858
MATT: For my part, the hardest part of NPCing is,
one: keeping them all straight in your mind at all

108
00:08:08,858 --> 00:08:14,890
times because there's a lot of characters to keep
track of, so extensive notes help. And, weirdly, a

109
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:17,813
number of communities online have been keeping
notes of the NPCs, so it's nice to have a

110
00:08:17,813 --> 00:08:22,486
community of people to help me. Someone sent me a
link once like, "Yeah, we've cataloged all

111
00:08:22,486 --> 00:08:27,773
"your NPCs and all their information about them in
this Excel document!" I'm like, "Send me the link, please?"

112
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,082
(laughter)

113
00:08:30,082 --> 00:08:35,776
MATT: And it has been very helpful! But yeah,
that's one of the hardest parts, and the other

114
00:08:35,776 --> 00:08:42,051
part is making sure that you don't end up putting
the players in a situation often where they let

115
00:08:42,051 --> 00:08:44,227
the NPCs talk to each other too much.

116
00:08:44,227 --> 00:08:46,790
MARISHA: That's our favorite!

117
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:53,669
MATT: No, it's a pain in the ass for me! Because, and part of
running a game is, your players are the heroes,

118
00:08:53,669 --> 00:08:56,980
and although they're not going to be the forefront
of every single story, you want to make sure that

119
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,955
they're still central to it. And if you're not
careful, or you create characters that are more

120
00:09:00,955 --> 00:09:04,853
powerful or capable and more involved in the story
than your party, you might end up in a situation

121
00:09:04,853 --> 00:09:09,984
where the players go, "Oh, well, let those guys
take care of it," and then all of a sudden, you've

122
00:09:09,984 --> 00:09:14,859
become the hero of your own game, which is going
to be very boring for the rest of the players. So

123
00:09:14,859 --> 00:09:20,529
make sure that you give agency enough to the
players where you're not stuck having the NPC the

124
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:25,009
hero. Good question! Next up, you choose this
one.

125
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:31,080
MARISHA: Let's do you in the back with the
Gilmore shirt on? Yeah, you!

126
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:36,763
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I was just wondering, you guys
started doing Pathfinder, and you switched for the

127
00:09:36,763 --> 00:09:42,090
show. Do you guys prefer doing Pathfinder or do
you like the switch to Fifth Edition?

128
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:44,379
MARISHA: Did you guys hear that? The question is,
do we--

129
00:09:44,379 --> 00:09:45,519
LAURA: Yes.

130
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,002
TRAVIS: Totally. I'll be honest, it's been so
long, I think I prefer Fifth Edition. There were

131
00:09:50,002 --> 00:09:52,418
parts of Pathfinder that were good for more
specific--

132
00:09:52,418 --> 00:09:59,202
LAURA: Yeah, I think it was just the actual
switchover was the hard part, because I don't like

133
00:09:59,202 --> 00:10:00,961
change very much, and--

134
00:10:00,961 --> 00:10:05,686
(laughter)

135
00:10:05,686 --> 00:10:10,801
LAURA: Yeah, so it was just hard getting used to
it, and hard going, "Wait a minute, I feel like if

136
00:10:10,801 --> 00:10:18,545
"I had started in 5th edition, I might not have
gone a ranger." Even though I love animals as pets.

137
00:10:18,545 --> 00:10:21,472
ALL: Aww!

138
00:10:21,472 --> 00:10:22,707
MATT: Hi, Charlie!

139
00:10:22,707 --> 00:10:26,581
ALL: Aww!

140
00:10:26,581 --> 00:10:30,566
MATT: Charlie's the best. The best animal
companion you could ever have.

141
00:10:30,566 --> 00:10:35,320
LAURA: Trinket is Charlie's character.

142
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:40,752
(laughter)

143
00:10:40,752 --> 00:10:48,675
MATT: They're both great systems. I feel when you
have a very large party, like we have, 5th edition

144
00:10:48,675 --> 00:10:54,246
is definitely much more functional. Pathfinder is
great if you like systems that are very

145
00:10:54,246 --> 00:11:00,361
customizable, and you can minutely tweak the kind
of character you want to create, however it does

146
00:11:00,361 --> 00:11:05,292
lend itself to a lot of floating, esoteric math,
and a lot of modifiers from different sources, and

147
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:09,560
that can get very difficult with larger parties. I
found 5th edition was a little easier to weave the

148
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:14,822
narrative into the combat, and simplify some of
those mechanics to make it a little better for a

149
00:11:14,822 --> 00:11:19,132
larger scheme like that. I prefer 5th edition over
them both, but only just barely, because I still

150
00:11:19,132 --> 00:11:23,632
played Pathfinder and 3.5 for many years, and I
loved the system a lot, but for my narrative

151
00:11:23,632 --> 00:11:29,815
preference? I'm a much more narrative-based player
than combat system mechanic-based player. If I had

152
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:31,619
to compare the two, I think 5th edition's more my
speed.

153
00:11:31,619 --> 00:11:36,202
MARISHA: Yeah, 5th edition brought in the
backgrounds, which I thought was really cool and

154
00:11:36,202 --> 00:11:42,097
interesting, especially for people who aren't as
readily familiar with jumping in and role playing,

155
00:11:42,097 --> 00:11:47,652
and coming up with a fully fleshed out backstory
for someone, so I think that was really cool to

156
00:11:47,652 --> 00:11:54,543
help people get inspired in that way that they
brought in 5th edition. What these guys said.

157
00:11:54,543 --> 00:11:58,456
MATT: Yeah. Good question! Next up. Travis, you
want to pick one?

158
00:11:58,456 --> 00:12:01,203
(laughter)

159
00:12:01,203 --> 00:12:02,813
TRAVIS: The one with the hand.

160
00:12:02,813 --> 00:12:04,583
(laughter)

161
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,292
MATT: I'll take that as--

162
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:11,672
LAURA: I feel like I can point to one, but you
won't know who I'm pointing to.

163
00:12:11,725 --> 00:12:12,580
MATT: That's fine.

164
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,274
LAURA: I'm going to point--

165
00:12:14,274 --> 00:12:15,378
TRAVIS: Point at the camera.

166
00:12:15,378 --> 00:12:16,676
LAURA: Oh, right.

167
00:12:16,676 --> 00:12:18,686
MARISHA: You're pointing at us.

168
00:12:18,686 --> 00:12:23,546
LAURA: This guy in the front row, and then this
guy in the middle that's holding his hand up, hold

169
00:12:23,546 --> 00:12:25,642
up like two fingers, if you know what I'm talking
about.

170
00:12:25,642 --> 00:12:28,370
MATT: Yes, all right, gentleman right there with
the glasses, and the two fingers up. Yes, you.

171
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:31,262
Laura Bailey just picked you from Los Angeles.

172
00:12:31,262 --> 00:12:33,692
(laughter)

173
00:12:33,692 --> 00:12:35,518
TRAVIS: Woohoo!

174
00:12:35,518 --> 00:12:40,913
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I was just curious, what positive
changes, other than being able to play every week,

175
00:12:40,913 --> 00:12:46,891
has bringing your home game to the internet given
you?

176
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,041
MATT: Oh yeah.

177
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,920
LAURA: I didn't hear what he said.

178
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,442
MATT: He said, "What other positive changes has
putting our game on the internet given us, outside

179
00:12:54,442 --> 00:12:56,448
"of being able to play more often?"

180
00:12:56,448 --> 00:12:57,830
LAURA: I get more dice.

181
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:08,300
(laughter)

182
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,021
TRAVIS: She's not kidding. It's a problem.

183
00:13:10,021 --> 00:13:12,333
(laughter)

184
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,582
TRAVIS: It's like not being able to turn away the
animals that come up to your house, with like 300

185
00:13:15,582 --> 00:13:22,807
pets. I like it because we actually semi-know
what we're doing. We played so few and far between

186
00:13:22,807 --> 00:13:28,872
before, that I would have to ask Matt the same 900
questions each time we played. He was like, "Come

187
00:13:28,872 --> 00:13:33,921
"on, man, you got to know your stuff." Doing it
each week, there's less of a chance of that

188
00:13:33,921 --> 00:13:39,021
happening. We still have no idea what we're doing,
at all. But there's just a little bit more

189
00:13:39,021 --> 00:13:40,294
knowledge there.

190
00:13:40,294 --> 00:13:46,554
MATT: That's true. I think that largely the most
positive thing that's come out of doing this is

191
00:13:46,655 --> 00:13:50,226
the community that's stemmed out of it. Our game
is still our game, and we enjoy it thoroughly, and

192
00:13:50,612 --> 00:13:56,985
it's still something that we as friends love to do
together, now on a weekly basis, but the community

193
00:13:56,985 --> 00:14:02,901
that's rallied around this is not only so
supportive and so inclusive, but it's inspired so

194
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,280
many other people to start their own game that
they wouldn't have otherwise. I love how many

195
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:11,012
people come up to us and send us tweets, and are
like, "This is a picture of our game group, now,

196
00:14:11,012 --> 00:14:15,049
"that meets because we met as fans of the show, and
here's our adventure and our characters," and it's

197
00:14:15,095 --> 00:14:19,579
a very proud papa feel that we have. That all
these people are creating their own stories

198
00:14:19,579 --> 00:14:25,820
together. That's the great thing about this type
of entertainment is, unlike a film or a television

199
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:31,538
series, this you can watch and be inspired, and
have the exact similar, but totally unique

200
00:14:31,599 --> 00:14:33,774
experience yourself with your friends at home.

201
00:14:33,774 --> 00:14:37,059
MARISHA: Yeah, I mean, you kind of took mine.

202
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:38,876
MATT: Sorry.

203
00:14:38,876 --> 00:14:44,287
MARISHA: Yeah, each game that we see, where someone's 
like, "We're playing for the first time because of you

204
00:14:44,287 --> 00:14:48,860
"guys!" It's like this little victory, and I mean
it's so overwhelming every time, like there's a

205
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:56,977
reason why Laura and I cry every time at Critmas.
Because it's overwhelming. Because you get all

206
00:14:56,977 --> 00:14:59,029
these letters, about people saying--

207
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:01,099
LAURA: And dice! You get all these dice.

208
00:15:01,099 --> 00:15:11,470
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Please tell me he's gone to get
it. Yes. We get to see the collection.

209
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:15,146
LAURA: I have to show off this art. Can you see it?

210
00:15:15,195 --> 00:15:24,708
(applause)

211
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:32,740
MATT: That's a great piece. That was awesome. All
right, next question? Travis, you pick this one.

212
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:38,243
TRAVIS: Oh, I pick this one? The guy that's
closest to the middle of the room. Along the

213
00:15:38,243 --> 00:15:41,198
aisle. He's got a black wristwatch or he's doing
something.

214
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:45,664
AUDIENCE MEMBER: What's the most surprising thing
you've learned about yourself from playing your characters?

215
00:15:45,664 --> 00:15:49,064
MATT: Ooh. What's the most surprising thing you've
learned about yourself playing your characters?

216
00:15:49,064 --> 00:16:02,660
MARISHA: I honestly believe that playing Keyleth
for four or five years now-- how long? I don't

217
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:08,025
know. However long we've been doing this-- almost
five years. Has made me a more empathetic and

218
00:16:08,025 --> 00:16:15,978
better person. I don't know if I was someone who
inherently tried to think about other people first

219
00:16:15,978 --> 00:16:25,619
before Keyleth. Now she's putting myself in her
shoes. I genuinely think because you always learn

220
00:16:25,619 --> 00:16:31,580
more when you walk a mile in someone else's shoes,
you get that perspective. So I think rolling

221
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:42,889
someone who is just trying to do the best-- the
most beneficial, good, positive choice every time,

222
00:16:42,889 --> 00:16:46,478
even though there might not be one is
interesting.

223
00:16:46,478 --> 00:16:48,258
MATT: Good answer.

224
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:49,908
LAURA: Your Keyleth is showing.

225
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:52,749
MARISHA: Thank you. Sorry, I dropped it on the
floor.

226
00:16:52,749 --> 00:16:57,477
TRAVIS: What about you?

227
00:16:57,477 --> 00:16:59,349
LAURA: No, you go first. I don't know. I don't
have an answer.

228
00:16:59,349 --> 00:17:06,390
TRAVIS: I love chaotic storytelling. One of the
first things that Matt ever told us as a DM was

229
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:13,998
don't play it safe. Safe is boring. And I love it
when shit goes wrong. I really, really love it

230
00:17:13,998 --> 00:17:21,170
when things go wrong, and we panic, and we try and
make the best of a shit situation. That's my favorite.

231
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,940
(laughter)

232
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,990
LAURA: What was the question?

233
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:29,177
TRAVIS: What are we most surprised to learn about
ourselves from playing? Maybe that means that I'm

234
00:17:29,177 --> 00:17:31,143
an asshole, but--

235
00:17:31,143 --> 00:17:33,123
(laughter)

236
00:17:33,123 --> 00:17:37,827
MARISHA: You're very resourceful, Travis. You're
probably our best strategist. You just

237
00:17:37,827 --> 00:17:40,071
unfortunately play a stupid character.

238
00:17:40,071 --> 00:17:43,491
(laughter)

239
00:17:43,491 --> 00:17:45,977
LAURA: I'd like to think Grog is street-smart. Just
not book-smart.

240
00:17:45,977 --> 00:17:47,678
MARISHA: Yeah, totally.

241
00:17:47,678 --> 00:17:53,669
MATT: That's the difference between wisdom and intelligence,
you can be a very insightful and naturally

242
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:57,479
receptive person to the world around you and still
not know anything about it.

243
00:17:57,479 --> 00:18:01,190
LAURA: His wisdom is low too, though.

244
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,219
(laughter)

245
00:18:03,219 --> 00:18:05,694
MATT: It's not low. It's higher than average. It's
like a 12, I think.

246
00:18:05,694 --> 00:18:07,498
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's something like that.

247
00:18:07,498 --> 00:18:08,821
LAURA: It's better than six.

248
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:11,760
MATT: Yeah. What about you, Laura?

249
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,827
LAURA: I think I've learned that I make a lot of
weird expressions. I hadn't really noticed it,

250
00:18:16,827 --> 00:18:22,529
until we started filming the show, and then I went
back and watched it and I was so embarrassed, the

251
00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:23,749
first one.

252
00:18:23,749 --> 00:18:25,839
TRAVIS: And you have a problem with dice.

253
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:31,559
(laughter)

254
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:37,770
MATT: I think my answer is the same as Laura's. I,
on a weekly basis, have the most delightful and

255
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:46,235
attractive freeze-frames sent to me on Twitter.
It's been great. It has perpetually stomped any

256
00:18:46,235 --> 00:18:53,431
semblance of an ego I could have possibly
mustered. It's made me a very humble person. Oh

257
00:18:53,431 --> 00:18:58,779
yeah. No. It never goes away, guys. It's always
there. There's an entire Tumblr that just posts

258
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:00,289
that picture every day.

259
00:19:00,289 --> 00:19:02,078
(laughter)

260
00:19:02,078 --> 00:19:04,190
MARISHA: Dude, that means you've made it. That's
like a--

261
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,951
MATT: Made what?!

262
00:19:05,951 --> 00:19:18,404
MARISHA: Dude. You're not web-famous until you're
like sad Keanu. Or like that Facebook that just

263
00:19:18,404 --> 00:19:21,480
posts the same picture of Tobey Maguire crying
every day.

264
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,250
MATT: Okay, do you know what? The fact that I
could exist somewhere between those two makes me

265
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:32,233
happy. I'm nowhere near as cool as sad Keanu, but
I'm so much better than sad Tobey Maguire. Okay,

266
00:19:32,259 --> 00:19:38,569
so I'm happy with that. Awesome. Next question.
Let's see. Let's get someone from the back. The

267
00:19:38,569 --> 00:19:40,210
giant cat paw over there.

268
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:46,400
AUDIENCE MEMBER: What are your favorite classes
and races?

269
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:58,301
MARISHA: Half-elf druid, bitches! Half-elf! No, I
don't know. I have been a half-elf and a druid for

270
00:19:58,301 --> 00:20:05,211
a very long time. So it's hard to say what's going
to be more my favorite. Dwarves are pretty dope.

271
00:20:05,211 --> 00:20:07,873
MATT: Yeah, for me, dwarves are definitely my
favorite race.

272
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,956
LAURA: (Swedish dwarf impression) Oh, hello!

273
00:20:09,956 --> 00:20:14,970
MATT: The awkward Swedish, brain-damaged dwarves are
my favorite.

274
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:19,007
MARISHA: (Swedish dwarf impression) Welcome to the
city of Kraghammer.

275
00:20:19,007 --> 00:20:21,988
TRAVIS: I like half-orcs.

276
00:20:21,988 --> 00:20:23,092
LAURA: Half-orcs?

277
00:20:23,092 --> 00:20:24,060
TRAVIS: Yeah.

278
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:27,101
LAURA: What about your class? What's your favorite
class?

279
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:28,329
TRAVIS: I don't know.

280
00:20:28,329 --> 00:20:42,316
LAURA: I like tieflings a lot. I don't know if I
want to say it because I might want to be them if

281
00:20:42,399 --> 00:20:46,152
Vex dies or ends up leaving for no reason.

282
00:20:46,152 --> 00:20:55,013
(laughter)

283
00:20:55,013 --> 00:21:09,460
MATT: Oh, man. Classes-wise? I tend to lean
towards magic casters because I like the options

284
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:14,369
of spell use. I think it can be a little
overwhelming at times. I tend to lean towards

285
00:21:14,369 --> 00:21:21,028
cleric or bard. Both underappreciated for a long
time across the board. Bards have definitely come

286
00:21:21,028 --> 00:21:27,486
into their own in the new edition. 5e has made
bards pretty damn powerful, which I like. Clerics

287
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:32,920
as a support class still don't get the love and,
for how necessary they are for a good functional party.

288
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,563
MARISHA: Oh, we know.

289
00:21:34,563 --> 00:21:37,519
MATT: At large.

290
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:42,687
LAURA: Bards are just so intimidating. I don't
know how Scanlan does it.

291
00:21:42,687 --> 00:21:45,350
TRAVIS: Oh, to play.

292
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:50,111
LAURA: To play would be so intimidating! To play a
bard, to have to come up with songs and stuff all

293
00:21:50,111 --> 00:21:51,308
the time.

294
00:21:51,308 --> 00:21:53,680
MATT: You don't have to come up with songs, that's
just Sam being an asshole.

295
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,583
(laughter)

296
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,106
LAURA: The bar is so high now.

297
00:21:58,106 --> 00:22:01,040
MATT: The <i>bard</i> is high.

298
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,247
(booing)

299
00:22:03,247 --> 00:22:11,320
MATT: The panel's over, guys, thanks for coming.
Scanlan's a musician bard, there are different

300
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:17,423
types of bard. You can be a storytelling bard, you
can be an inspirational leader, a military leader

301
00:22:17,423 --> 00:22:25,219
who inspires through phrases. There's different
ways you can do it, you can grant inspiration die

302
00:22:25,267 --> 00:22:29,393
by just standing in the front lines of an army and
giving your Aragorn speech, "But it is not that

303
00:22:29,393 --> 00:22:32,536
"day!" Everyone goes, "Yay, I take my d12."

304
00:22:32,536 --> 00:22:35,129
(laughter)

305
00:22:35,129 --> 00:22:39,459
LAURA: But paladins do? Don't they have
inspiration stuff like that, or am I making shit up?

306
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:40,928
MATT: You're making shit up.

307
00:22:40,928 --> 00:22:45,477
MARISHA: Paladins have a thing, they're like,
"Rally! Rabble, rabble, rabble."

308
00:22:45,477 --> 00:22:47,128
LAURA: Yeah, seriously, there's a rally thing!

309
00:22:47,128 --> 00:22:53,490
MATT: No. They have auras that can help people
that are nearby, their presence is helpful.

310
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,457
LAURA: Oh, I'm thinking of Dragon Age!

311
00:22:55,457 --> 00:23:05,279
MATT: Yes, you are. There is actually a feat
called Inspiring Leader where you get to do that

312
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:07,449
no matter what class you are, which is pretty
fun.

313
00:23:07,449 --> 00:23:13,177
MARISHA: Don't Warcraft paladins kind of have a
same thing too where they can be like (rally cry)?

314
00:23:13,177 --> 00:23:14,490
What's that called?

315
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,151
AUDIENCE MEMBER: That's Diablo.

316
00:23:16,151 --> 00:23:21,393
MARISHA: Oh, it's Diablo. You know what, I can't
keep all of my paladins straight, you guys!

317
00:23:21,393 --> 00:23:29,478
MATT: Awesome, next question. Yeah, Marisha, you
pick this one.

318
00:23:29,478 --> 00:23:32,789
MARISHA: Let's go you right in front in the duck
hat.

319
00:23:32,789 --> 00:23:38,869
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Since you're expressing interest
in changing characters or dying off, if one of

320
00:23:38,869 --> 00:23:42,640
them wanted to come in as a chaotic evil, would
you allow it in your campaign?

321
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,218
MATT: I'd allow it.

322
00:23:44,218 --> 00:23:45,869
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Even though it's only a
singular?

323
00:23:45,869 --> 00:23:48,260
MATT: If a character wanted to come back as
chaotic evil--

324
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:56,325
(laughter)

325
00:23:56,325 --> 00:24:02,866
MATT: It's definitely allowed, there would be a
very real conversation of understanding that

326
00:24:02,866 --> 00:24:08,719
introducing a chaotic evil into a largely neutral
to good campaign, there's a high probability that

327
00:24:08,719 --> 00:24:15,808
if you're not very careful, you're going to wind
up dead. It depends, you might take a few party

328
00:24:15,808 --> 00:24:20,011
members out, but if you're one evil guy in a group
of six to seven good people, you're probably going

329
00:24:20,011 --> 00:24:21,718
to die.

330
00:24:21,718 --> 00:24:23,228
MARISHA: You have to be really clever.

331
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:29,486
MATT: Evil characters, especially lawful evil,
understand the necessity of allies and they keep

332
00:24:29,486 --> 00:24:33,227
that under wraps, then the party doesn't know
you're evil, and you coordinate well and

333
00:24:33,227 --> 00:24:34,530
manipulate your--

334
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:47,374
(laughter)

335
00:24:47,401 --> 00:24:48,892
MATT: It's a difficult thing, but it can be done.

336
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:50,523
LAURA: He's writing on his trackpad.

337
00:24:50,523 --> 00:24:57,352
MATT: Perfect. All right, let's go next question.
Let's go over here on the far side.

338
00:24:57,352 --> 00:25:01,540
TRAVIS: We'll do one more question, then we'll let
you guys get to the panel so you're not slogging

339
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,670
us along.

340
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:05,025
MATT: Okay, well then, do you have a question for
Laura or Travis?

341
00:25:05,025 --> 00:25:06,989
MARISHA: She has one!

342
00:25:06,989 --> 00:25:10,324
MATT: Okay, we'll get to you after this. What's
your question for Laura and Travis before they go?

343
00:25:10,324 --> 00:25:16,931
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I know Laura's got a thing for
dice, so does my other half, big time. Travis, how

344
00:25:16,931 --> 00:25:19,128
do you deal with it? Because he drives me crazy.

345
00:25:19,128 --> 00:25:30,864
TRAVIS: Every session, I steal one dice. It's this
slow bleed, this slow drain of dice.

346
00:25:30,864 --> 00:25:34,143
LAURA: No, because he's not allowed to touch my
dice.

347
00:25:34,143 --> 00:25:36,619
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Then she buys more to replace
them!

348
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:42,505
TRAVIS: That's true. It's kind of like plucking
your eyebrow hair, right? You pluck one, and two

349
00:25:42,505 --> 00:25:43,928
more spring out.

350
00:25:43,928 --> 00:25:53,969
LAURA: I don't have as many dice as Wil Wheaton.
When I went over to Wil's house, he literally has

351
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,098
<i>barrels</i> of dice.

352
00:25:56,098 --> 00:25:58,634
MARISHA: What? Are you serious?

353
00:25:58,634 --> 00:26:04,415
LAURA: Oh, I'm serious. The little pink-- like you
guys would know what it looks like-- I have a pink

354
00:26:04,415 --> 00:26:09,914
glittery one that I took from his pile. I was
like, "Ooh!" And I took it and he's like, "Yeah,

355
00:26:09,914 --> 00:26:14,229
"take it. I have barrels of dice." It always rolls
terribly.

356
00:26:14,229 --> 00:26:21,009
MATT: But is he hoarding the dice because he wants
to or because that's how he can keep them from

357
00:26:21,009 --> 00:26:25,637
actually being out in the open? He's trying to
protect the rest of the world from the dice he's touched.

358
00:26:25,637 --> 00:26:30,516
TRAVIS: He's swallowing the sin of the dice.

359
00:26:30,516 --> 00:26:35,930
MATT: You know Wil, the Sin-Eater, the
Sin-Swallower Wheaton.

360
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:40,577
(laughter)

361
00:26:40,577 --> 00:26:49,037
MATT: You're all dirty people. Guys, do you have
any last parting bits you want to say before we

362
00:26:49,037 --> 00:26:50,496
let you go?

363
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,788
TRAVIS: No.

364
00:26:51,788 --> 00:26:59,261
LAURA: Yes! We love you guys, we're just so sorry
that our flight got canceled.

365
00:26:59,261 --> 00:27:01,270
TRAVIS: Man, weather is stupid, y'all.

366
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:03,709
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Travis, you're missing the beer!

367
00:27:03,709 --> 00:27:06,576
LAURA: Ugh!

368
00:27:06,576 --> 00:27:19,157
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch! I appreciate the beer. We
really wish we could've been there to see you

369
00:27:19,157 --> 00:27:24,284
guys, we were looking forward to it for a long
time. Sucks that Matt and Marisha had to bribe the

370
00:27:24,284 --> 00:27:26,547
airlines to let their plane take off.

371
00:27:26,547 --> 00:27:29,378
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Because druids have Control
Weather!

372
00:27:29,378 --> 00:27:31,988
MARISHA: Exactly, I can control weather.

373
00:27:31,988 --> 00:27:41,069
MATT: All right guys, thank you so much for taking
the time, we'll take it from here. Have a

374
00:27:41,069 --> 00:27:42,641
wonderful night!

375
00:27:42,641 --> 00:27:46,628
(cheering and applause)

376
00:27:46,628 --> 00:27:53,168
MARISHA: Thank you guys!

377
00:27:53,168 --> 00:27:54,839
MATT: Thank you, we'll see you soon!

378
00:27:54,839 --> 00:28:01,188
MARISHA: Bye! Oh, I love those guys.

379
00:28:01,188 --> 00:28:04,299
MATT: All right, now that they're gone.

380
00:28:04,299 --> 00:28:11,768
MARISHA: Vic! Oh, hi! How are you?

381
00:28:11,768 --> 00:28:14,268
VIC: Sorry, just have to give a little love to
these guys.

382
00:28:14,268 --> 00:28:18,971
MARISHA: Your shirt is badass. Can we talk for a
second about-- you look like you're ready to

383
00:28:18,971 --> 00:28:25,174
adventure right now. Like your armor is ready to
be thrown on. How are you?

384
00:28:25,174 --> 00:28:28,198
VIC: Sorry!

385
00:28:28,198 --> 00:28:39,857
MARISHA: This is the con where people just come in
and they're like, "Hey guys, just thought I'd come

386
00:28:39,857 --> 00:28:41,752
"by your panel."

387
00:28:41,752 --> 00:28:44,058
VIC: I'm so sorry I missed Travis and Laura too,
oh my god!

388
00:28:44,058 --> 00:28:45,322
MARISHA: You just missed them.

389
00:28:45,322 --> 00:28:49,702
VIC: I saw them on the screen and I was like,
(shouting) "Travis! Laura! It's me!"

390
00:28:49,702 --> 00:28:56,249
MATT: It's like, "Oh, we've got to go now. Bye!"
See you, buddy!

391
00:28:56,249 --> 00:28:58,048
MARISHA: See you later, Vic!

392
00:28:58,048 --> 00:28:59,921
MATT and MARISHA: Bye, Vic!

393
00:28:59,921 --> 00:29:02,988
(cheering and applause)

394
00:29:02,988 --> 00:29:05,858
MATT: That shirt is at least AC 12, I'm pretty
sure.

395
00:29:05,858 --> 00:29:07,592
MARISHA: Definitely.

396
00:29:07,592 --> 00:29:15,459
MATT: Which means he has a low armor class, he's
going to die. That was weird.

397
00:29:15,459 --> 00:29:17,651
(laughter)

398
00:29:17,651 --> 00:29:27,616
MATT: All right, continuing with our panel.

399
00:29:27,616 --> 00:29:39,688
MARISHA: I smell like him now. All right, next
question. Yeah, you had one, right? You were going

400
00:29:39,688 --> 00:29:41,379
to go next.

401
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:47,146
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We're in a couple of D&amp;D
campaigns right now. We're actually in two. One is

402
00:29:47,146 --> 00:29:52,819
a more straight dungeon-crawl campaign, the other
one's a silly one where it's just goofing off

403
00:29:52,819 --> 00:30:02,108
nonstop. But I want to DM another campaign based
on your book that's going to be coming out. I want

404
00:30:02,108 --> 00:30:09,819
it to be a more story-driven one, a more RP-based
one. Do you have any tips for trying to steer the

405
00:30:09,819 --> 00:30:12,649
players towards that?

406
00:30:12,649 --> 00:30:18,074
MATT: Yes, if you want your campaign to be a
little more story, narrative, role-playing

407
00:30:18,147 --> 00:30:23,107
focused, the first step is talking to the party
about that. You want to talk to the players and be

408
00:30:23,107 --> 00:30:28,895
like, "Hey guys, I would like this game to be more
role-playing heavy. Are you all cool with that?"

409
00:30:28,895 --> 00:30:34,610
Because you can't force the players to play a way
if they don't want to play that way. If you want

410
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:37,578
to run a game like that and the players don't,
then maybe you need to find other players for that

411
00:30:37,578 --> 00:30:43,006
particular campaign. Otherwise, you're going to
end up pissing each other off, or one side's going

412
00:30:43,006 --> 00:30:49,165
to be unhappy with it. So talk to them, and if
they're all up for the challenge, then discuss how

413
00:30:49,165 --> 00:30:54,032
you plan to do so. Ways you can do that is have
each person develop a stronger backstory for their

414
00:30:54,032 --> 00:30:58,167
character that you can either incorporate into the
narrative, or at least, they have a strong idea of

415
00:30:58,167 --> 00:31:02,826
where their character choices can come from. A fun
way to do this is to challenge them to make a

416
00:31:02,826 --> 00:31:06,265
character that is drastically different from
themselves. Usually when you start playing a game,

417
00:31:06,265 --> 00:31:09,384
it's instinctual to make a character that's
similar to you because it's what you understand

418
00:31:09,384 --> 00:31:13,197
the best, and it's a good introduction to a
role-playing experience because a lot of your

419
00:31:13,197 --> 00:31:18,473
decisions are the kind of decisions you would
make. A fun challenge to make a character that is

420
00:31:18,473 --> 00:31:23,807
very different-- like Marisha making Keyleth was a
ballsy move, very different from you, but it

421
00:31:23,807 --> 00:31:24,806
allows you to--

422
00:31:24,806 --> 00:31:28,855
MARISHA: I thought it was going to be a one-shot!
Was not supposed to last for five years.

423
00:31:28,855 --> 00:31:31,537
MATT: It's very true.

424
00:31:31,537 --> 00:31:37,601
MARISHA: I was like, "I never play good, insecure
people, I should do that."

425
00:31:37,601 --> 00:31:39,216
MATT: Just for one session.

426
00:31:39,216 --> 00:31:40,122
MARISHA: Just once.

427
00:31:40,122 --> 00:31:49,127
MATT: I recommend having that conversation with
people. Then the background helps them decide

428
00:31:49,127 --> 00:31:53,628
where they come from for their character and their
choices. Engaging people in a role-play

429
00:31:53,628 --> 00:32:00,524
standpoint, a lot of it is on the burden of the GM
to directly engage with them as NPCs. There's a

430
00:32:00,524 --> 00:32:04,656
difference between looking at a paper being, "As
you enter the bar, the bartender says, 'Hi, would

431
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:10,153
"'you like a drink?' So do you guys want to buy
drinks?" The difference going, "As you enter the

432
00:32:10,153 --> 00:32:15,397
"bar, the bartender spins his head towards you, his
eyes meet yours, (gruff voice) 'You! Come sit down

433
00:32:15,397 --> 00:32:21,788
"'at the table! Now, could I get you a drink?'" The
player almost has no choice necessarily except to

434
00:32:21,788 --> 00:32:27,216
answer them as a conversation. I they go, "Well, I
tell them perhaps yes, we'll buy drinks," be like,

435
00:32:27,216 --> 00:32:32,504
"Okay, well then, tell me as your character."
Then, "Yes, we'll be happy to sit down and buy

436
00:32:32,504 --> 00:32:36,624
"drinks!" That little moment has already engaged
them a little bit beyond their comfort zone.

437
00:32:36,624 --> 00:32:43,093
Little moments over time help the players be more
comfortable to play in that space. It is

438
00:32:43,093 --> 00:32:47,129
uncomfortable for a lot of people at first, so you
have to be patient with them, and try your best to

439
00:32:47,129 --> 00:32:50,773
pull them in, and at the end of the session, have
a little post-mortem and ask, "What'd you like

440
00:32:50,773 --> 00:32:55,317
"about it, what you didn't like. Next time, we'll
try a little more of this." Yeah, baby steps,

441
00:32:55,317 --> 00:33:00,153
because for some people, it's not a very
comfortable space to be. If they're willing to

442
00:33:00,153 --> 00:33:04,849
try, then keep pushing it ever so slowly in that
direction, and over time, you'll eventually get to

443
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:07,062
a better role-playing story.

444
00:33:07,062 --> 00:33:11,978
MARISHA: Yeah, and I always to reiterate that when
we first started our game-- because we'd already

445
00:33:11,978 --> 00:33:19,832
been playing for about two years before we turned
the camera on-- our first game was just that. It

446
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:25,564
was silly, it was crazy. I remember Laura took to
it, she had never played before, she took to it

447
00:33:25,564 --> 00:33:30,720
like a fish to water. She gets in and she's like,
(Vex impression) "All right lads. Come on, let's

448
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:38,944
"get in here, let's go kill something." I remember
Liam and Travis being like, "What? What's going

449
00:33:38,944 --> 00:33:44,998
"on? Why are they talking like--?" I remember
Travis being like, "You have an accent? Do I have

450
00:33:44,998 --> 00:33:48,094
"to have a British accent? Does everyone have to
have a British accent?"

451
00:33:48,094 --> 00:33:51,018
(laughter)

452
00:33:51,018 --> 00:34:01,643
MARISHA: He was like, "What are the rules? I don't
know!" Vax and Grog, Vax was such an inherent

453
00:34:01,643 --> 00:34:10,504
prankster, and we're seeing that come out of Vax
again now, but in our early days, it was just how

454
00:34:10,504 --> 00:34:19,644
Vax can prank everyone else in the game. So it was
way more jovial-- we didn't have our first

455
00:34:19,644 --> 00:34:29,881
serious, heavy moment, when tears were shed, was
when Pike died for the first time. That was before

456
00:34:29,881 --> 00:34:34,145
stream, and that was when we started getting a
little bit more serious. We didn't have a lot of

457
00:34:34,145 --> 00:34:43,304
heavy back-and-forth dialogue, deep, intense
character-driven exploration as much, especially

458
00:34:43,304 --> 00:34:51,890
in that first year. It was very jovial, very
light. We were actors, and they were still like,

459
00:34:51,890 --> 00:35:02,300
"What, you want me to-- (sighs) all right, (gruff
voice) 'Yes, bartender...'" It takes time.

460
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,743
MATT: The book comes out right around GenCon. Hope
you like it.

461
00:35:06,743 --> 00:35:11,930
(applause)

462
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:14,894
MARISHA: It is going to be a really good book.

463
00:35:14,894 --> 00:35:24,132
MATT: It goes into a Silmarillion-like history of
creation, creation myth of Exandria, the immediate

464
00:35:24,132 --> 00:35:31,582
history of Tal'Dorei post the Divergence or the
Calamity. Then it goes into all the geography and

465
00:35:31,582 --> 00:35:36,658
various locations and information about them as story
hooks that you can use in your campaign for a lot

466
00:35:36,685 --> 00:35:43,014
of the locations there. I have a bunch of additional 
Vestiges in the book as well, I have some new backgrounds

467
00:35:43,014 --> 00:35:45,013
that are specific, I have some--

468
00:35:45,013 --> 00:35:47,958
MARISHA: Ashari is a background. We made Ashari a
background.

469
00:35:47,958 --> 00:35:53,709
MATT: There's a misconception that Ashari are all
druids, they're not. They're an entire people-- a

470
00:35:53,753 --> 00:35:58,614
tribe. The druids tend to be the top of hierarchy
because of their nature-based power, but there are

471
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:03,400
people that are just farmer Ashari, warriors,
protectors, and so Ashari is a background that can

472
00:36:03,439 --> 00:36:08,391
be applied to any class. If you're pretty creative
you can come up with an Ashari warlock but it is

473
00:36:08,391 --> 00:36:14,792
possible. I have new backgrounds based on
different locations, and you can make a member

474
00:36:14,792 --> 00:36:16,576
of the Clasp if you wanted to--

475
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:20,451
MARISHA: I can think of an Ashari warlock
background right now.

476
00:36:20,451 --> 00:36:22,172
MATT: Look at that, boom. It's done.

477
00:36:22,172 --> 00:36:28,182
MARISHA: Maybe you're a fire Ashari and grew up in
the City of Brass and then you stumbled upon the

478
00:36:28,182 --> 00:36:35,892
rift in the plane, the split between our realm and
theirs, and then you ended up just becoming a part

479
00:36:35,892 --> 00:36:40,498
of the Ashari tribe and living amongst them
because you appreciated them and you were a warlock

480
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:43,054
first. You could be a warlock Ashari, you could do
it!

481
00:36:43,054 --> 00:36:54,356
MATT: I never said you couldn't! Yes, you can. I've
got more new feats you can try out. Some fun

482
00:36:54,406 --> 00:37:00,117
things. Some new optional rules like different
resurrection rules, the one we use in the campaign

483
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:04,963
now. Some other optional resurrection rules I put
in there. The corruption system that you saw a

484
00:37:04,963 --> 00:37:09,079
little bit of in Whitestone, that's in the book as
well. It's like a pared down version of the Heroes

485
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:14,204
of Order book version. It's got some fun stuff.

486
00:37:14,204 --> 00:37:21,549
MARISHA: He does maybe two, three voiceover
sessions a day, comes home, goes in his office,

487
00:37:21,574 --> 00:37:27,535
writes. Wake up, do it again. This has been
for six, nine months.

488
00:37:27,575 --> 00:37:29,834
MATT: It's been unhealthy.

489
00:37:29,834 --> 00:37:31,256
MARISHA: Almost done, though.

490
00:37:31,256 --> 00:37:39,239
MATT: Almost done. I can get back to the gym
again. Thank you, good question. All right, let's

491
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:45,303
see. I'm going to go ahead and-- When a green
person is pointing at you, you have to choose that

492
00:37:45,303 --> 00:37:47,816
hand. All right, sir, you with the beard.

493
00:37:47,816 --> 00:37:52,404
MARISHA: He basically had a green Bigby's Hand.
Right here.

494
00:37:52,404 --> 00:37:59,933
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Fifth edition is not exactly
great for combat as far as large groups of people

495
00:37:59,933 --> 00:38:08,187
going against small numbers of enemies. As a DM, what
is a good way to counteract that with a small

496
00:38:08,187 --> 00:38:15,016
group of enemies? As a player, what are some of the
smaller groups of enemies that have given you guys

497
00:38:15,016 --> 00:38:16,754
more of a challenge?

498
00:38:16,754 --> 00:38:23,344
MATT: Actually, to counter that a bit. Not all
enemies have this, but the legendary actions

499
00:38:23,344 --> 00:38:28,615
system does offset that tremendously. If any
creature you're worried about will be

500
00:38:28,615 --> 00:38:35,544
steamrolled, as a singular or small-scale
opposition, you can add a series of legendary

501
00:38:35,544 --> 00:38:40,353
actions where you can-- usually they have three
legendary actions per round they can do and they

502
00:38:40,353 --> 00:38:44,791
have different attacks they can use at the end of
somebody else's turn, which is pretty useful. Also,

503
00:38:44,791 --> 00:38:50,315
if you have a large party, you can customize some
abilities or add abilities to certain creatures

504
00:38:50,315 --> 00:38:57,034
that can hit multiple characters. Like sweep
attacks that can get things apart or an attack

505
00:38:57,034 --> 00:39:01,451
that has a cone as opposed to a singular target.
Those are cool ways to customize and help out in

506
00:39:01,451 --> 00:39:05,064
that regard. That comes with experience and
figuring it out as you go. I find legendary

507
00:39:05,064 --> 00:39:12,364
actions helps a lot and giving them more mobility,
because when you have a lot of players on the

508
00:39:12,364 --> 00:39:16,602
field, it's hard for creatures to move around
without taking a shit-ton of attacks of

509
00:39:16,602 --> 00:39:20,301
opportunity. You can give them a legendary action
they can spend once that lets them move their speed

510
00:39:20,301 --> 00:39:23,749
without taking attacks of opportunity against
them. Now they have a lot more battlefield

511
00:39:23,749 --> 00:39:27,092
mobility, they can get to places that are
advantageous to them without being smacked by four

512
00:39:27,092 --> 00:39:33,482
PCs as they go by. In fact, there's a GM Tips
episode that talks about that a bit too. But those

513
00:39:33,482 --> 00:39:36,445
are some of my most basic recommendations for
that.

514
00:39:36,445 --> 00:39:41,784
MARISHA: Also, if anyone is not aware, we have a
little sideshow on Geek &amp; Sundry called GM Tips

515
00:39:41,784 --> 00:39:44,159
and you've done the first several.

516
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:46,951
MATT: We have 16 up and think I have four more
coming up pretty soon.

517
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:49,876
MARISHA: Then we're going to switch to a
different GM, because you can only learn so much

518
00:39:49,924 --> 00:39:54,682
from one teacher. Right, guys? Other people have
different perspectives. We're going to switch it

519
00:39:54,682 --> 00:40:02,226
up soon, so be on the lookout for that. The GM Tips
is really good for anyone. They're five-minute episodes.

520
00:40:02,267 --> 00:40:05,121
MATT: Yeah, they're quick. They're
bite-sized. They're general tips, and if you want

521
00:40:05,121 --> 00:40:09,525
more nuts and bolts, a good friend of ours, Matt
Colville, has a number of great videos on Youtube,

522
00:40:09,525 --> 00:40:15,413
on his channel. He gets into the real nitty-gritty
of ways to build worlds, encounters, theories, and

523
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:18,482
running games, as well as players. Highly
recommend that.

524
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:23,282
MARISHA: Matt's a writer. He writes for
videogames. He works for Turtle Rock a lot. He

525
00:40:23,282 --> 00:40:30,852
wrote Evolve, a lot of the dialogue and stuff for
Evolve, so he knows what he's talking about. He's

526
00:40:30,852 --> 00:40:38,524
a good source. From a player standpoint, to answer
your question, some of the stuff that started

527
00:40:38,524 --> 00:40:46,331
really blowing our minds was when the terrain
started coming into place. The fight in the

528
00:40:46,331 --> 00:40:53,911
Underdark, where if you stood in one place and
didn't move on your turn, then the undead hands

529
00:40:53,911 --> 00:41:00,819
would reach up and start pulling you underground.
That was what started really messing with us, when

530
00:41:00,819 --> 00:41:06,221
there were environmental situations that started
coming into play, because that doesn't always have

531
00:41:06,221 --> 00:41:14,051
to be a bad guy. Matt, you tend to do a lot of
guys in waves. Which is interesting, because

532
00:41:14,051 --> 00:41:21,116
especially as a player, you're like, "These two
bastards, all right." Bam bam bam bam, "All right,

533
00:41:21,116 --> 00:41:24,981
"we only took one hit-- aw, three more are coming?"
(groans)

534
00:41:24,981 --> 00:41:27,481
(laughter)

535
00:41:27,481 --> 00:41:31,630
MATT: Not every battle has every single piece in
the field at once. Sometimes things will surprise

536
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:36,031
them midway through. Sometimes part of the initial
conflict is actually a distraction for the actual

537
00:41:36,031 --> 00:41:40,973
ambush that's making its way from the opposite
side. Think of ways that you can turn it on the

538
00:41:40,973 --> 00:41:45,260
players' head, where it's not just these chess
pieces versus these chess pieces. You mix up the

539
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:51,990
encounter structure to keep players confused, and
make them feel threatened, even though it's not

540
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:57,610
intended to be a full TPK. They could probably win
this battle, but what if the enemies have higher

541
00:41:57,610 --> 00:42:02,228
ground and have the ability to pour hot oil onto
them on the field? A couple of goblins can be

542
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:06,419
pretty nasty if they have that type of an
advantage, so those are cool little ways to tweak

543
00:42:06,419 --> 00:42:07,687
it as well.

544
00:42:07,687 --> 00:42:14,487
MARISHA: I feel like it's always there are bad
things in tiny packages. You notice it's always

545
00:42:14,487 --> 00:42:22,448
the tiny enemies that you underestimate, like what
was that little brain dude with legs that kept

546
00:42:22,448 --> 00:42:26,015
zapping Grog's intelligence? What were those
called?

547
00:42:26,015 --> 00:42:29,115
MATT: That was the mind--

548
00:42:29,115 --> 00:42:30,559
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Mind Flayer!

549
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:33,271
MATT: No, it wasn't the Mind Flayer.

550
00:42:33,271 --> 00:42:35,038
MARISHA: No, they were like mind sucker things.

551
00:42:35,038 --> 00:42:36,457
MATT: Sorry, everyone said blah at once.

552
00:42:36,457 --> 00:42:37,754
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Brain Devourer!

553
00:42:37,754 --> 00:42:38,816
MATT: Brain Devourer, thank you.

554
00:42:38,816 --> 00:42:40,220
MARISHA: Brain Devourer, yes!

555
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:41,624
MATT: Yeah, that guy was fun.

556
00:42:41,624 --> 00:42:44,974
MARISHA: Man, those guys.

557
00:42:44,974 --> 00:42:51,194
MATT: DND comes from a long-standing, wonderful
bloodline in history of making things that are

558
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:56,034
just shitty, and then seeing what you can do about
it. You're like, "Oh, this guy only does six

559
00:42:56,034 --> 00:43:03,445
"damage. But if I miss the saving throw, I'm dead?"
What? What? Gygax is somewhere in heaven, going,

560
00:43:03,445 --> 00:43:04,573
"Hahahahaha".

561
00:43:04,573 --> 00:43:05,816
(laughter)

562
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:10,649
MATT: Gygax is burning in hell for that. You know
that. He's down there going "Ha, I made them all

563
00:43:10,649 --> 00:43:19,424
"ride in the Tomb of Horrors." Not really, Gygax,
we love you. There are ways of turning the

564
00:43:19,424 --> 00:43:24,208
battlefield pretty quickly based on simple, not
really scary-looking creatures that have one

565
00:43:24,208 --> 00:43:26,544
really terrible ability.

566
00:43:26,544 --> 00:43:28,019
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Or doors.

567
00:43:28,019 --> 00:43:32,041
MATT: Doors apparently will fuck up your party, I
discovered.

568
00:43:32,041 --> 00:43:34,429
MARISHA: It's dumb.

569
00:43:34,429 --> 00:43:36,609
(laughter)

570
00:43:36,609 --> 00:43:38,900
MATT: It's not that I make the doors hard--

571
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,022
MARISHA: I know!

572
00:43:40,022 --> 00:43:41,686
MATT: You roll terribly every time.

573
00:43:41,686 --> 00:43:49,497
MARISHA: It's kismet because we've gotten lucky in
several battles where we should have all died. So

574
00:43:49,497 --> 00:43:52,951
I'll take doors. I'll take that as an exchange.

575
00:43:52,951 --> 00:43:55,713
MATT: There was somebody that mentioned to me a
while back, Doordak the Cedar King.

576
00:43:55,713 --> 00:43:58,079
(laugher)

577
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:03,721
MATT: I was like, that would have been a much
better enemy. Next time. Next question, you take

578
00:44:03,721 --> 00:44:05,038
this one.

579
00:44:05,038 --> 00:44:11,229
MARISHA: Let's see, you also doing the Bigby's
Hand to him. Yeah, you.

580
00:44:11,229 --> 00:44:13,063
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Me?

581
00:44:13,063 --> 00:44:14,348
MARISHA: Yeah!

582
00:44:14,348 --> 00:44:18,218
AUDIENCE MEMBER: What is your favorite town/city
that you've been to in DND?

583
00:44:18,218 --> 00:44:28,947
MARISHA: That's a great question. Favorite
town/city, man. Any of the towns in the Feywild

584
00:44:28,947 --> 00:44:34,221
are always crazy and awesome.

585
00:44:34,221 --> 00:44:36,419
MATT: You really only went to one town in the
Feywild.

586
00:44:36,419 --> 00:44:37,664
MARISHA: Yeah, what was it called?

587
00:44:37,664 --> 00:44:38,491
MATT: It was Syngorn.

588
00:44:38,491 --> 00:44:42,758
MARISHA: But Syngorn's not based in the Feywild.
Just the Feywild in general was cool.

589
00:44:42,758 --> 00:44:45,858
MATT: It's a fun place.

590
00:44:45,858 --> 00:44:47,435
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Beautiful Pixie town.

591
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:49,988
MATT: You didn't really visit that so much as
you--

592
00:44:49,988 --> 00:44:53,213
MARISHA: Invaded it, and then killed them all.

593
00:44:53,213 --> 00:44:54,507
(laughter)

594
00:44:54,507 --> 00:44:58,239
MATT: Yeah, yeah. (laughs)

595
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:04,076
MARISHA: That moment when you realize Vox
Machina's just a fascist regime in the Feywild.

596
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:11,328
MATT: "Oh, these poor werewolves. Got to help
them." To be fair, the pixies were dicks.

597
00:45:11,328 --> 00:45:13,116
MARISHA: They were being dicks!

598
00:45:13,116 --> 00:45:17,338
MATT: They were. I'm not going to comment on which
side was better than the other, but either choice

599
00:45:17,338 --> 00:45:19,046
would have looked shitty, regardless.

600
00:45:19,046 --> 00:45:31,830
MARISHA: That's true. City of Brass was awesome.
Ank'Harel was incredible. That's all you; that's

601
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:34,959
not necessarily D&amp;D. City of Brass is D&amp;D.

602
00:45:34,959 --> 00:45:40,299
MATT: City of Brass is D&amp;D, yeah. Ank'Harel-- that
will be in a book sometime in the future, maybe.

603
00:45:40,299 --> 00:45:46,538
If this one does well, then maybe we'll do other
continent. Wildemount, Issylra, and Marquet all are

604
00:45:46,538 --> 00:45:47,886
their own spaces.

605
00:45:47,886 --> 00:45:49,234
MARISHA: What's your favorite city?

606
00:45:49,234 --> 00:45:56,561
MATT: Oh, man. I have a special place in my heart
for a couple of reasons: Sigil. (pronounced "siggle")

607
00:45:56,561 --> 00:45:58,838
(laughter)

608
00:45:58,838 --> 00:46:04,788
MATT: The City of Doors. I like it. As a
Planescape fan, as a person who played Planescape:

609
00:46:04,788 --> 00:46:08,408
Torment and loved the game, loved the whole
setting-- the idea that there is this one city,

610
00:46:08,408 --> 00:46:18,248
this weirdly Inception-like city that folds on
itself in this doughnut pattern that is a central

611
00:46:18,248 --> 00:46:23,815
nexus to all the planes and all the worlds, that
all dimensions connect to and go there to do

612
00:46:23,815 --> 00:46:28,535
business and travel, but it's also guarded by this
mysterious entity called the Lady of Pain, and

613
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:32,911
nobody fully understands where she came from, but
apparently watches everything in the city, and if

614
00:46:32,911 --> 00:46:38,428
anyone does anything that goes against her rules
of playing it nice in the streets, she'll show up

615
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:45,404
silently and <i>murder you</i>. So it's a city where
everyone from the Nine Hells, from the Abyss, from

616
00:46:45,404 --> 00:46:49,559
the Prime Material World, they all go there, and
they all hate each other, but they respectfully

617
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:54,600
nod and do business because they never want to see
the Lady of Pain show up and kill them. And it's

618
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:59,489
also called Sigil, which is where I learned to
mispronounce the word, and it's the City of Doors,

619
00:46:59,489 --> 00:47:01,148
which has become funny because of you guys.

620
00:47:01,148 --> 00:47:03,178
(laughter)

621
00:47:03,178 --> 00:47:08,321
MARISHA: I want to call my period "the Lady of
Pain".

622
00:47:08,321 --> 00:47:10,869
(laughter, applause)

623
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:15,267
MARISHA: It's visiting. The Lady of Pain's in
town. All right.

624
00:47:15,267 --> 00:47:18,649
MATT: Next question.

625
00:47:18,649 --> 00:47:20,002
MARISHA: You pick it.

626
00:47:20,002 --> 00:47:24,506
MATT: Okay, I'm going to go way back, hiding
behind the pillar with your hand up in the fuzzy

627
00:47:24,506 --> 00:47:26,420
wrist and wearing an awesome t-shirt.

628
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:30,519
MARISHA: Yeah, you in the how do you want to do
this shirt! Sorry.

629
00:47:30,519 --> 00:47:36,331
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Out of all the characters, who's
your least favorite, and who's your favorite?

630
00:47:36,331 --> 00:47:38,997
MATT: Out of all the NPCs and players?

631
00:47:38,997 --> 00:47:41,420
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Even guests.

632
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:42,785
MATT: Even guests?

633
00:47:42,785 --> 00:47:46,326
(groaning)

634
00:47:46,326 --> 00:47:49,105
MATT: I shouldn't have called on you.

635
00:47:49,105 --> 00:47:52,729
(laughter)

636
00:47:52,729 --> 00:47:54,949
MATT: That's a loaded question. It's an
interesting question. Marisha?

637
00:47:54,949 --> 00:48:00,435
(laughter and applause)

638
00:48:00,435 --> 00:48:03,698
MATT: Favorite and least favorite character. Go.

639
00:48:03,698 --> 00:48:16,438
MARISHA: Hang on. I'm sure I have one. Favorite
and least favorite character. Someone that's...

640
00:48:16,438 --> 00:48:28,319
MATT: Oh, man. (groans)

641
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:31,018
MARISHA: There's got to be--

642
00:48:31,018 --> 00:48:32,825
MATT: I'm partial to Gilmore.

643
00:48:32,825 --> 00:48:37,709
(cheering)

644
00:48:37,709 --> 00:48:43,089
MATT: He was never intended to be such a central
NPC to the story. He was a fun NPC that they would

645
00:48:43,089 --> 00:48:47,728
come across in Emon when they first visited, and I
fleshed him out to be this fun showman

646
00:48:47,728 --> 00:48:53,610
personality, and they took a shine to him and kept
coming back, and eventually he became this

647
00:48:53,610 --> 00:49:00,898
unexpectedly central character. Even had a
temporary romance with one of the PCs and followed

648
00:49:00,898 --> 00:49:07,679
them into the fiery bowels of a dragon's den. He's
become a really cool, wonderful character that I

649
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:14,098
connected with immensely, and I'm happy to see that
he survived. There were a couple of times I was

650
00:49:14,098 --> 00:49:18,982
like, "He might not make it. Please make it. The
internet will light me on fire."

651
00:49:18,982 --> 00:49:21,209
(laughter)

652
00:49:21,209 --> 00:49:29,530
MATT: Least favorite: Wil Wheaton, only for his
rolls. I really wanted to see his character do

653
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:34,500
well. I was like, "Yes. Dwarf! Finally, we have a
dwarf PC in the game. Oh, and he's a fighter!

654
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:42,919
"Great. He's going to get-- he's doing nothing. And
nothing. Great." At least now we know that the

655
00:49:42,919 --> 00:49:44,718
curse is real.

656
00:49:44,718 --> 00:49:46,474
MARISHA: It's uncanny.

657
00:49:46,474 --> 00:49:48,384
MATT: That blew my fucking mind!

658
00:49:48,384 --> 00:49:52,530
MARISHA: We're not making that shit up, you guys.

659
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:55,652
MATT: You're like, "Oh, it's scripted." It's like,
"No!"

660
00:49:55,652 --> 00:50:04,098
MARISHA: I've never seen anything like that. He
breaks math. He breaks the law of averages.

661
00:50:04,098 --> 00:50:09,131
MATT: After that episode, four or five string
theory theoretical physicists were in a room

662
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:14,657
going, "No! No! It's ruined everything!"

663
00:50:14,657 --> 00:50:22,072
MARISHA: "I spent my doctorate on this!" Man.
Least favorite is so hard, because even the people

664
00:50:22,072 --> 00:50:29,373
that you get frustrated with or that you don't
like, it doesn't mean that they're bad characters.

665
00:50:29,373 --> 00:50:33,530
Generally, everyone is so fleshed out and
thorough--

666
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,973
MATT: It's okay. You don't have to spare me.

667
00:50:35,973 --> 00:50:45,279
MARISHA: No, I'm being serious. In game, I've had
altercations with Kima, but she's probably one of

668
00:50:45,279 --> 00:50:54,099
my favorite characters. Raishan was Keyleth's
arch-enemy, but also one of my favorite villains

669
00:50:54,099 --> 00:51:01,982
that we've had to date. Even though she was
frustrating, because you never knew what she'd

670
00:51:01,982 --> 00:51:11,570
say, if it was true or not. Yeah, it's good. It's
tough. I like things that break the

671
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:24,015
meta-narrative. I don't believe that there is a
100% good vs evil metric system; that's why I love

672
00:51:24,015 --> 00:51:31,822
anti-heroes so much, and I love characters that
break that formula. I feel like most of our

673
00:51:31,822 --> 00:51:38,290
characters in the game do. Not everyone's great,
and not everyone's horrible, either. Everyone has

674
00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:45,184
their motives. That's what's always important:
everyone has their motives. Some of my favorites?

675
00:51:45,184 --> 00:51:52,936
I'm really partial to Allura, but I think it's
because Keyleth is starting to look to her as a

676
00:51:52,936 --> 00:52:03,032
mentor, as an example of leadership and who she
wants to become, so yeah. Allura is great. We've

677
00:52:03,032 --> 00:52:12,740
had some good moments, me and Allura. Yeah. Good
times, me and A. Me and Allie.

678
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:15,144
MATT: Only Kima gets to call her that.

679
00:52:15,144 --> 00:52:22,476
MARISHA: That's true. Sorry. It's jam town over
there.

680
00:52:22,476 --> 00:52:38,410
[offscreen singing and laughter]

681
00:52:38,410 --> 00:52:40,111
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Only you can hear that!

682
00:52:40,111 --> 00:52:42,761
(laughter)

683
00:52:42,761 --> 00:52:47,936
MATT: The rest of the panel is us awkwardly
dancing to nothing. I'm glad you waited a while!

684
00:52:47,936 --> 00:52:57,802
MARISHA: If only I had a nickel. Yeah, you. You've
been enthusiastic. Yeah, what's up?

685
00:52:57,802 --> 00:53:04,365
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I just really started actually
DMing for these guys.

686
00:53:04,365 --> 00:53:06,774
MARISHA: Hey! DM in the house!

687
00:53:06,774 --> 00:53:14,825
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I find a problem for me is when I
have a number of NPCs because I quickly lose the

688
00:53:14,825 --> 00:53:23,243
word you use to get into a character's voice, and
I realize that you guys are actors, professional

689
00:53:23,243 --> 00:53:32,500
voice actors, so do you have any tricks for
remembering what an NPC's voice-- even an area of

690
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,412
what their voice is supposed to be?

691
00:53:34,412 --> 00:53:40,511
MATT: Yes, actually. Almost all my NPCs, if
they're not improvised in the moment, where I'll

692
00:53:40,511 --> 00:53:46,502
make a note later, I'll write next to their name.
I'll have their name in bold on whatever my note

693
00:53:46,502 --> 00:53:50,767
sheet is, and then in parentheses and italics next
to it, I'll put a few notes about their voice,

694
00:53:50,767 --> 00:53:59,123
like low, gravelly, slightly off-putting
personality, close parentheses. (shouting) Ian Sinclair!

695
00:53:59,123 --> 00:54:07,719
IAN: An example is when you did Black Butler: Book
of Circus, you had a bunch of people in a certain

696
00:54:07,719 --> 00:54:09,741
town who had the same dialect, yeah?

697
00:54:09,741 --> 00:54:10,921
MATT: Yes, actually.

698
00:54:10,921 --> 00:54:12,426
MARISHA: (accented) Was that north country?

699
00:54:12,426 --> 00:54:13,462
MATT: No, west country.

700
00:54:13,462 --> 00:54:14,452
MARISHA: (accented) Oh, west country?

701
00:54:14,452 --> 00:54:15,310
MATT: Yeah.

702
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:17,281
MARISHA: Oh.

703
00:54:17,281 --> 00:54:29,651
(laughter and applause)

704
00:54:29,702 --> 00:54:31,579
MARISHA: He's our own personal Kool-Aid man.

705
00:54:31,673 --> 00:54:33,818
MATT: That was the slowest "Oh yeah!"

706
00:54:33,818 --> 00:54:35,236
MARISHA: Oh yeah!

707
00:54:35,236 --> 00:54:36,604
IAN: Oh yeah!

708
00:54:36,604 --> 00:54:37,766
MATT: There it is.

709
00:54:37,766 --> 00:54:40,264
(laughter)

710
00:54:40,264 --> 00:54:45,633
MATT: Yeah, I'll take notes to remind me of that.
High-pitched, reedy, this dialect, if there is

711
00:54:45,633 --> 00:54:51,204
one, or different personality traits. I'll put
quick hand, so when it comes back, I can remind

712
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:54,370
myself very quickly. Note cards help very well for
that, too.

713
00:54:54,370 --> 00:54:56,374
AUDIENCE MEMBER: What were your notes for Victor?

714
00:54:56,374 --> 00:54:58,444
MATT: Victor was improvised.

715
00:54:58,444 --> 00:55:01,056
AUDIENCE MEMBER: So what notes do you have now for
him?

716
00:55:01,056 --> 00:55:06,485
MATT: The notes I have now for him? I don't need
notes for Victor. Those are NPCs that are so

717
00:55:06,485 --> 00:55:10,693
poignant in your mind, like Gilmore or Allura, or
those guys. I don't need to remember their notes,

718
00:55:10,693 --> 00:55:16,539
necessarily. Victor quickly became one of those.
It's hard to forget that, and the internet made

719
00:55:16,539 --> 00:55:23,083
sure that I would never forget it. That's a huge tool
for me. And if worse comes to worst, if you know

720
00:55:23,083 --> 00:55:28,687
the story is going in a certain place, you can
also record those NPC voices at the end of the

721
00:55:28,687 --> 00:55:33,125
session, a couple of short audio files in your
phone, then before the game when your next session

722
00:55:33,125 --> 00:55:38,518
starts, you can give a quick listen to remind
yourself of the place you were at. Hopefully that

723
00:55:38,518 --> 00:55:47,092
helps. Awesome. (accented) Let's see. I'm going to
pick-- let's go-- oh, there are so many hands!

724
00:55:47,132 --> 00:55:49,200
You, sir. You've been on the side here for a bit.

725
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:54,485
AUDIENCE MEMBER: If you guys were not playing D&amp;D
or Pathfinder, what game system would you guys

726
00:55:54,485 --> 00:55:56,143
want to play?

727
00:55:56,143 --> 00:56:02,492
MATT: Which, by the way, we are playing D&amp;D
partially because it's what I grew up with, and

728
00:56:02,492 --> 00:56:06,915
it's the mainstay. Because for a lot of these
people, D&amp;D was their first game, D&amp;D is the

729
00:56:06,915 --> 00:56:10,728
easiest entry point. If you tell a bunch of
people, "Hey, guys, let's go play Traveler!"

730
00:56:10,728 --> 00:56:14,491
They'd be like, "I don't know what that is." If
you say, "Dungeons &amp; Dragons," they get an idea,

731
00:56:14,491 --> 00:56:19,442
at least, what they're in for. Especially with 5th
Edition, I've come to really love the new edition.

732
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:29,192
If it weren't D&amp;D or Pathfinder? Oh, man. I'd love
to run a Call of Cthulhu game. 1920s, original era.

733
00:56:29,192 --> 00:56:31,824
MARISHA: I want to go insane so bad.

734
00:56:31,824 --> 00:56:39,003
MATT: That'd be fun. I love Deadlands as a
setting, too. Got to do the one-shot for that, the

735
00:56:39,003 --> 00:56:44,343
Deadwood one-shot. Which was fun. I got to say all
the things I never get to say on stream.

736
00:56:44,343 --> 00:56:48,542
MARISHA: What's that one where you're basically an
anime character?

737
00:56:48,542 --> 00:56:54,743
MATT: Oh! Exalted. Exalted would be fun, too.
Exalted is crazy. When we say it's like an anime

738
00:56:54,743 --> 00:56:59,411
character, the idea is you build a character who
has abilities that can be made into a combo, and

739
00:56:59,411 --> 00:57:06,955
you get additional benefits for how crazy stupid
the attack was. The crazier you describe it, the

740
00:57:06,955 --> 00:57:10,489
GM's like, "All right, you get two bonus dice
because that shit sounds <i>nuts</i>!"

741
00:57:10,489 --> 00:57:12,572
(laughter)

742
00:57:12,572 --> 00:57:21,312
MATT: That's Exalted. It's great. I love Exalted.
Yeah, so probably Call of Cthulhu, Deadlands, or

743
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:25,702
Exalted. World of Darkness would be fun, too.
There are so many good systems! It's hard to pick.

744
00:57:25,702 --> 00:57:30,017
They're all their own different flavor. Depends on
what mood you're in, really. Yeah.

745
00:57:30,017 --> 00:57:37,753
MARISHA: Yeah. All right, let's see. Let's do you
with the Overwatch hat. Yeah, you.

746
00:57:37,753 --> 00:57:40,745
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I didn't raise my hand. Hi!

747
00:57:40,745 --> 00:57:43,764
MARISHA: That's okay! Hi! Oh, you're like a
samurai.

748
00:57:43,764 --> 00:57:54,253
AUDIENCE MEMBER: My first tabletop game ever was
the premade campaign Castle Ravenloft. It made me

749
00:57:54,253 --> 00:57:56,785
an insanely paranoid player.

750
00:57:56,785 --> 00:57:58,248
MATT: Good.

751
00:57:58,248 --> 00:58:06,013
AUDIENCE MEMBER: If you could pick one premade
campaign that would start somebody off, which

752
00:58:06,013 --> 00:58:07,563
would you pick?

753
00:58:07,563 --> 00:58:10,635
MATT: Oh, man. I would say Curse of Strahd--

754
00:58:10,635 --> 00:58:13,604
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We managed to kill Strahd, by the
way.

755
00:58:13,604 --> 00:58:18,313
MATT: Curse of Strahd's a great one. For anybody
who wants a little bit of gothic horror in their

756
00:58:18,313 --> 00:58:26,160
fantasy tropes, Curse of Strahd or the original
Expedition to Ravenloft are amazing games. I love

757
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:33,152
those. As far as other ones, I really liked the
political elements of Storm King's Thunder that

758
00:58:33,152 --> 00:58:38,633
came out last year. I felt that giants are an
under-utilized creature that when you think of

759
00:58:38,633 --> 00:58:43,062
giants in fantasy, especially a D&amp;D setting, you
don't get that depth of an idea what their culture

760
00:58:43,062 --> 00:58:48,352
is or what their personality is. Just, "This is a
big guy who has fire! This is a big guy who has

761
00:58:48,352 --> 00:58:54,239
"ice!" So it was really cool for them to bring in
the different cultures and how they intersect, and

762
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:58,984
the breaking of the Ordning, and the vying for the
top position within that hierarchy of giant

763
00:58:58,984 --> 00:59:03,612
culture, so I thought it was a really cool setting. Chris
Perkins and the team over there did an amazing job

764
00:59:03,612 --> 00:59:09,132
with it. I think Storm King's Thunder is a really
cool setting. It's a little more elaborate and

765
00:59:09,162 --> 00:59:13,342
political at times, so it's a good way to get you
into that type of game if you haven't had that

766
00:59:13,342 --> 00:59:18,572
before. If your gamers are more of a "kick down door, kill
monsters, take loot," it might be not quite their

767
00:59:18,572 --> 00:59:25,781
speed. For that, you'd do maybe the Mines of
Whatever-the-fuck-it's-called.

768
00:59:25,781 --> 00:59:27,561
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Phandelver!

769
00:59:27,561 --> 00:59:33,912
MATT: Yes, that one. The Mines of Whatever the
Fuck It's Called! Official title.

770
00:59:33,912 --> 00:59:38,073
MARISHA: I know Eberron's a popular campaign.

771
00:59:38,073 --> 00:59:41,169
MATT: Eberron's a great setting, by the way. Keith
Baker did a great job with the Eberron setting.

772
00:59:41,169 --> 00:59:43,752
MARISHA: That's old-school.

773
00:59:43,752 --> 00:59:50,863
MATT: They have some stuff. The new artificer
class technically originated in the Eberron

774
00:59:50,863 --> 00:59:55,734
setting, though I know Keith Baker wasn't involved
in the development of the new one. But yeah, those

775
00:59:55,734 --> 01:00:03,469
would be my recommendations. All right, let's-- I
have to pick Percy. Sorry. You put a lot of effort

776
01:00:03,469 --> 01:00:04,983
into that.

777
01:00:04,983 --> 01:00:09,378
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you! There's been a lot of
serious moments in the campaign so far, especially

778
01:00:09,378 --> 01:00:13,993
lately. For the both of you, what have been your
favorite lighthearted moments?

779
01:00:13,993 --> 01:00:16,010
MATT: Favorite lighthearted moments in the game.

780
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:26,753
MARISHA: Cows. I will never forget that until the
day I die. Nothing will beat flying cows.

781
01:00:26,753 --> 01:00:31,953
MATT: Not just flying cows, but masquerading as
cows via Seeming and then interrogating cows.

782
01:00:31,953 --> 01:00:34,541
Thinking that cows could be useful to
interrogate.

783
01:00:34,541 --> 01:00:41,964
MARISHA: Then using ourselves as cows as living
bait. Then chasing down somebody, still as cows.

784
01:00:41,964 --> 01:00:44,263
That was great.

785
01:00:44,263 --> 01:00:49,577
MATT: That was the weirdest, unintentional E.T.
parody ever. They're coasting over the moon.

786
01:00:49,577 --> 01:00:52,453
MARISHA: (mooing)

787
01:00:52,453 --> 01:00:55,343
MATT: Oh my god, because the cows are jumping over
the moon, I get it now. Oh my god, it never ends!

788
01:00:55,343 --> 01:01:04,610
That was pretty great. Oh man, the fact that a
party member would stop in the middle of

789
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:13,092
traversing a duergar stronghold in the Underdark
to take a shit on a bed for no reason. For no

790
01:01:13,092 --> 01:01:20,567
reason! Every pub crawl you guys go on is great.

791
01:01:20,567 --> 01:01:24,807
MARISHA: You could honestly lead this
conversation with anything Sam does.

792
01:01:24,807 --> 01:01:30,987
MATT: Yeah, kind of. He's brilliant. Once again,
why I love bards. The fact that there are ways you

793
01:01:30,987 --> 01:01:38,278
can kill enemies by mocking them to death was one
of the best utility elements in any RPG ever. It's beautiful.

794
01:01:38,278 --> 01:01:43,681
MARISHA: Yeah, I feel like good stuff always
comes-- the spa. When we were in the spa in the

795
01:01:43,681 --> 01:01:53,903
mansion and we did the cannonball contest! That
was awesome, that was fun! I like when we use our

796
01:01:53,903 --> 01:01:59,252
enormous power and strength for petty
competitions. Just great!

797
01:01:59,252 --> 01:02:04,123
MATT: Just because you are the most powerful
heroes in the land doesn't mean you can't still be

798
01:02:04,123 --> 01:02:05,709
a bunch of dumbfucks.

799
01:02:05,709 --> 01:02:07,480
MARISHA: Yeah, we're just a bunch of kids.

800
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:16,427
MATT: I love it. Awesome. Let's see, let's go way
over there. Yes you, by the wall.

801
01:02:16,427 --> 01:02:21,932
AUDIENCE MEMBER: As a DM, Matt, do you ever wish
you could be a character and somebody else could

802
01:02:21,932 --> 01:02:23,722
DM for a while?

803
01:02:23,722 --> 01:02:28,225
MATT: The question was, as a DM, do I wish I could
play once in a while and somebody else can DM. I

804
01:02:28,225 --> 01:02:32,824
mean, yeah, every now and then, but if I compare
the experience of being a player and a DM,

805
01:02:32,824 --> 01:02:39,215
honestly, I enjoy the experience of running a game
so thoroughly, and being able to provide that

806
01:02:39,215 --> 01:02:44,523
experience for other people, that I prefer DMing
over playing, for me at least. But it is nice to

807
01:02:44,523 --> 01:02:48,719
occasionally get to play in something, and so,
with our campaign, it's a little difficult because

808
01:02:48,719 --> 01:02:54,321
it's an ongoing story and it's not something I can
hand off since I created the whole thing. I know

809
01:02:54,321 --> 01:02:59,781
we've talked about, coming up soon when we finish
the current arcs, you guys tie up some loose ends,

810
01:02:59,781 --> 01:03:06,912
we might take a short, couple-week break from the
main story and maybe have Liam run a game

811
01:03:06,912 --> 01:03:11,153
for us, in which case I could play.

812
01:03:11,153 --> 01:03:15,323
(applause)

813
01:03:15,323 --> 01:03:19,612
MATT: I've had the opportunity to guest on a few
other shows that do live play games like the

814
01:03:19,612 --> 01:03:25,614
RollPlay guys, I've guested a few times on there.
I guested for an Open Legend session over at

815
01:03:25,614 --> 01:03:29,092
HyperRPG. So I've had the opportunity a few times
to play.

816
01:03:29,092 --> 01:03:32,443
MARISHA: And Colville DMed for you not long ago.

817
01:03:32,443 --> 01:03:33,791
MATT: That's true, for us.

818
01:03:33,791 --> 01:03:35,981
MARISHA: Yeah, for me, you, and Liam.

819
01:03:35,981 --> 01:03:43,013
MATT And Fryda Wolff! The female lead voice in the
new Mass Effect: Andromeda, who hadn't booked

820
01:03:43,013 --> 01:03:44,802
that at the time, we were happy to hear she got that.

821
01:03:44,802 --> 01:03:46,047
MARISHA: Yeah!

822
01:03:46,047 --> 01:03:52,448
MATT: Yeah, it happens occasionally. I do miss it,
but if I had to pick, I prefer to GM than play,

823
01:03:52,448 --> 01:03:57,089
really. Which, by the way, let that be a point to
you guys out there who are ever curious about

824
01:03:57,089 --> 01:04:03,202
GMing. Please do it, it's so much fun. It's a
little bit more work on your point, and at first,

825
01:04:03,202 --> 01:04:07,179
it can be a lot to wrap your head around, but once
you get into it, there's nothing quite as

826
01:04:07,179 --> 01:04:12,017
fulfilling as creating an experience for other
people and watching them enjoy it. It's such an

827
01:04:12,017 --> 01:04:13,751
awesome gift.

828
01:04:13,751 --> 01:04:15,101
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Watch them die.

829
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:16,982
MATT: Watch them die, that can happen too.

830
01:04:16,982 --> 01:04:19,944
MARISHA: As I always say, it's your world, we're
just playing in it.

831
01:04:19,944 --> 01:04:26,311
MATT: But you guys also build the story in the
world. That's the thing, people will say, "I love

832
01:04:26,311 --> 01:04:32,051
"what you create for the show!" I'm like, "I create
a stage, everyone else creates the narrative."

833
01:04:32,051 --> 01:04:36,590
It's one of the wonderful things about D&amp;D is that
it's such a collaboration. Each person brings such

834
01:04:36,590 --> 01:04:43,041
an amazing, different type of story to the overall
narrative. Every game that any of us have played

835
01:04:43,041 --> 01:04:50,058
in a roleplaying game, it's everyone making it
together. So I'm just one part of that engine. So

836
01:04:50,058 --> 01:04:55,661
are you! Appreciate your players and players,
appreciate your GMs, please. Good question!

837
01:04:55,661 --> 01:05:04,269
MARISHA: Let's go in the back for the people who
are far in the back. You, the guy who's got the

838
01:05:04,269 --> 01:05:08,956
devil horns up, who I can't see really. Yeah, you!
Hi!

839
01:05:08,956 --> 01:05:15,458
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I just wanted to say, since you
guys were talking about how you guys are internet

840
01:05:15,458 --> 01:05:18,071
famous, like having a Tumblr page for you.

841
01:05:18,071 --> 01:05:19,711
MARISHA: That's weird. Keep going.

842
01:05:19,711 --> 01:05:26,287
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You're actually on Snapchat right
now, one of the stories [inaudible]. My question

843
01:05:26,287 --> 01:05:37,645
would be, I want to try to make a city that I
build for my nerd groups feel real for them and

844
01:05:37,645 --> 01:05:44,964
have a texture beyond a bar down the road. What is one
of the things that you do that makes that work for

845
01:05:44,964 --> 01:05:46,787
your campaign?

846
01:05:46,787 --> 01:05:51,508
MATT: It helps, one, to very quickly establish
what makes that city unique against the other ones

847
01:05:51,508 --> 01:05:53,470
they've already encountered.

848
01:05:53,470 --> 01:05:56,969
MARISHA: The question was about giving cities
texture beyond a pub.

849
01:05:56,969 --> 01:06:02,360
MATT: There you go, thank you. So making cities
feel unique to your players. First thing about

850
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:06,748
what makes it unique. What do you want the players
to think about when they think of this city down

851
01:06:06,748 --> 01:06:17,028
the road? Is it a very militaristic law, everyone
lives under an iron fist and is trying desperately

852
01:06:17,028 --> 01:06:22,265
to eke out what freedoms they can? Then you would
pose that by mentioning how well-armored and how

853
01:06:22,265 --> 01:06:27,645
present the guards are, and how clean the streets
are and how everyone seems to be very eager to do

854
01:06:27,702 --> 01:06:34,552
their job and not stray. Architecture helps too.
If it's a very destitute location, you can talk

855
01:06:34,552 --> 01:06:39,191
about how the streets themselves are not
well-kept. What was once cobblestone has been

856
01:06:39,191 --> 01:06:44,403
broken and cracked and filled with mud. Every cart
seems to have a hard time making its way through

857
01:06:44,403 --> 01:06:52,022
the main thoroughfare. The sound of nearby insects
buzzing ever-presently causes you to feel unrest

858
01:06:52,022 --> 01:06:59,683
in the presence of this city. What I think also
helps too is to think of what the political

859
01:06:59,683 --> 01:07:06,294
structure is in that city. Is it a free republic,
is it an oligarchy and the people that rule the

860
01:07:06,294 --> 01:07:11,701
town are the business heads, and as such, the one
beautiful-looking district is the one that

861
01:07:11,701 --> 01:07:18,852
contains all the guilds and all the money, and the
rest is left to flounder and barely exist? Is it a

862
01:07:18,852 --> 01:07:24,644
monarchy, or is it a committee that runs
everything, and it seems to be a free-spirited,

863
01:07:24,644 --> 01:07:30,484
socialist atmosphere, and what is befalling that
type of a thing as well, so they're infighting

864
01:07:30,484 --> 01:07:35,054
within that cycle now that everyone's equal? Being
in that political structure can be an easy way to

865
01:07:35,054 --> 01:07:39,993
think how the rest of the town functions.
Does everyone work collaboratively, or is everyone

866
01:07:39,993 --> 01:07:44,783
in competition with each other? That can breed an
atmosphere that the players can encounter very

867
01:07:44,783 --> 01:07:48,991
quickly when they enter. So you think of those
notes when you build the city, and then as they

868
01:07:48,991 --> 01:07:53,362
enter it, you find what visually marks it
separately, and the further they begin to talk to

869
01:07:53,362 --> 01:07:56,592
people, you think of what politically and socially
makes it separate and different.

870
01:07:56,592 --> 01:08:04,433
MARISHA: You do such a good job. I feel like we
throw curveballs at you, and you always have an

871
01:08:04,433 --> 01:08:09,701
answer. Like when we were like, "What's the main
underground market here?" You're always like,

872
01:08:09,701 --> 01:08:15,723
"I mean, drugs!" We're like, "How did you-- you
already knew that?" You seem to always know the

873
01:08:15,723 --> 01:08:17,276
underbelly of the city as well.

874
01:08:17,276 --> 01:08:21,298
MATT: That's a good thing to establish, even if
you haven't. When you've built the infrastructure

875
01:08:21,298 --> 01:08:25,274
of a city with all of the things I mentioned
before, the other elements that you hadn't thought

876
01:08:25,274 --> 01:08:32,152
of will be easy to rationally think up on the
spot. Because if it's a really clean, militaristic

877
01:08:32,152 --> 01:08:38,462
city, what is it in that type of atmosphere that
people would be seeking more often than not? It

878
01:08:38,462 --> 01:08:40,701
might be illegal substances, it could be--

879
01:08:40,701 --> 01:08:42,328
MARISHA: Weapons.

880
01:08:42,328 --> 01:08:46,299
MATT: Yeah, weapons, things to defend themselves.
Is there a rebellion within the city that's trying

881
01:08:46,299 --> 01:08:51,324
to eventually overthrow the militaristic
political structure and if so, are they bringing

882
01:08:51,324 --> 01:08:55,924
that trade in? These are all things that you can
improvise once you have enough of the structure in

883
01:08:55,924 --> 01:09:00,746
place, then you rationalize the next step. The
other key to being a DM is when you make shit up,

884
01:09:00,746 --> 01:09:08,812
act like you had it the entire time. Most of
running a game is making shit up. Most of it is,

885
01:09:08,812 --> 01:09:13,054
but if you say it confidently, and the players
don't know, you're the only one who knows.

886
01:09:13,054 --> 01:09:14,343
MARISHA: Like Victor.

887
01:09:14,343 --> 01:09:19,768
MATT: Like Victor! I was like, "Oh yeah, totally
had him designed! No." I'd say a good half of the

888
01:09:19,768 --> 01:09:22,984
NPCs you guys have talked to are all things that I
pulled out of my ass because I didn't know what

889
01:09:22,984 --> 01:09:29,384
you were doing. But if you say it with conviction,
they won't know. But if you do that, write it

890
01:09:29,384 --> 01:09:31,168
down, take notes.

891
01:09:31,168 --> 01:09:43,123
MARISHA: What about when we went to Draconia, the
lead Ravenite's name? What was her name?

892
01:09:43,123 --> 01:09:44,642
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Tooma!

893
01:09:44,642 --> 01:09:46,709
MARISHA: Tooma! Was she made up?

894
01:09:46,709 --> 01:09:47,975
MATT: I don't know.

895
01:09:47,975 --> 01:09:49,733
(laughter)

896
01:09:49,733 --> 01:09:55,701
MARISHA: Damn it! Never mind. Forget I said
anything.

897
01:09:55,701 --> 01:09:57,692
MATT: No, to answer your question, yes, she was.

898
01:09:57,692 --> 01:09:58,684
MARISHA: Really?

899
01:09:58,684 --> 01:10:05,034
MATT: Yeah. I wasn't expecting you guys to go to
her so soon, and I hadn't finished fleshing out

900
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:09,803
the specifics of the current Ravenite structure
that was taking over. I was focusing on the

901
01:10:09,803 --> 01:10:14,221
current path that you guys were on. It's always a
chase, it's always trying to develop as much as I

902
01:10:14,221 --> 01:10:19,417
can ahead of them, but also have a life and a
career and, you know, eat, sleep, and breathe

903
01:10:19,417 --> 01:10:20,514
occasionally.

904
01:10:20,514 --> 01:10:21,580
MARISHA: Yeah.

905
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:24,213
MATT: There will be a bunch of cases where I think
I know where the players are going, and I'll

906
01:10:24,213 --> 01:10:27,479
develop a lot of preparation in this direction,
and then right as it's about to hit, they go this

907
01:10:27,479 --> 01:10:30,993
way. I'm like, "Oh, okay. Let's see where this
goes!"

908
01:10:30,993 --> 01:10:38,602
MARISHA: I will say, this isn't
really spoiler-y, I felt a little bad when we

909
01:10:38,602 --> 01:10:43,423
were like, "Let's go to the Earth Ashari," this
past episode. I could immediately see you being

910
01:10:43,423 --> 01:10:45,394
like, "Yeah? Okay."

911
01:10:45,394 --> 01:10:51,442
MATT: I had to go into my Google Drive--

912
01:10:51,442 --> 01:10:54,374
MARISHA: "Uh-huh, okay. Oh, you're going to go
over? Okay, you guys do that for a second."

913
01:10:54,374 --> 01:10:58,779
MATT: I had to go to the Cliffkeep Mountains
portion of the campaign guide that I had written to go

914
01:10:58,779 --> 01:11:05,404
look up Terrah. That's how it works. A lot of it's
improvisation and trying to play it off like you

915
01:11:05,404 --> 01:11:16,047
had it under control the entire time. All right,
we'll start getting into more lightning-round mode

916
01:11:16,047 --> 01:11:20,149
over here. Not full sincere lightning round, but
we've got to try to get some fast answers so we

917
01:11:20,149 --> 01:11:21,640
can answer a lot more questions.

918
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:22,539
MARISHA: Sure.

919
01:11:22,539 --> 01:11:25,865
MATT: Because we got a few out there. Let's go
with Scanlan in the back. I mean, I have to.

920
01:11:25,865 --> 01:11:28,722
MARISHA: (singing) Scanlan, Bigby's Hand!

921
01:11:28,722 --> 01:11:37,690
AUDIENCE MEMBER: As a player, what can a GM do to
make a session more dynamic, more fun, fill up the

922
01:11:37,690 --> 01:11:39,527
atmosphere at your table?

923
01:11:39,527 --> 01:11:46,619
MATT: Easy tricks? Music to me always helps build
atmosphere. It's so simple and you can make

924
01:11:46,619 --> 01:11:54,046
playlists for different moods. Great resources are
movie soundtracks. When you stream it online, you

925
01:11:54,046 --> 01:11:58,395
can only have music that you have approval for,
but previously it was Conan the Barbarian

926
01:11:58,395 --> 01:12:02,727
soundtracks, Lord of the Rings soundtrack, all
these great fantasy soundtracks that you know of,

927
01:12:02,727 --> 01:12:08,221
use those! No reason not to. And set playlists
based on if it's a battle theme or a peaceful

928
01:12:08,221 --> 01:12:15,691
theme or if it's a tense theme. That's a really easy
trick. Also, you as the GM, you guide the energy

929
01:12:15,691 --> 01:12:22,651
of the room. If you're lulling, the players will
lull too, so you have to put a little extra energy

930
01:12:22,651 --> 01:12:25,810
into it to make sure that as you're talking,
you're engaging, you're looking players in the

931
01:12:25,810 --> 01:12:29,681
face. You can look at notes, but make sure that if
you have notes in front of you, you take enough

932
01:12:29,681 --> 01:12:33,687
time to look up and still engage. If you're down
here the whole time describing the dungeon they

933
01:12:33,687 --> 01:12:40,840
went into, everyone's going to start checking
their texts. Eye contact makes a big difference,

934
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:53,099
surprisingly. Keeping them fed. Food's a big deal.
The classic idea of eating Cheetos and drinking

935
01:12:53,099 --> 01:12:56,831
Mountain Dew, it's like, no, that shit worked! For
a reason!

936
01:12:56,831 --> 01:13:03,941
MARISHA: We used to do, back before we streamed,
we would pull 12-hour D&amp;D days, and we would get

937
01:13:03,941 --> 01:13:11,845
together around 10am and we would always start
with a nice brunch and mimosas. So great!

938
01:13:11,845 --> 01:13:14,690
MATT: It's pretty rad, mimosa D&amp;D is <i>greatly</i>
recommended.

939
01:13:14,690 --> 01:13:23,636
MARISHA: Bagels, some yogurt, smoked salmon, and
mimosas. Then you play D&amp;D all day. It's the best.

940
01:13:23,636 --> 01:13:27,290
MATT: If you have players that have a hard time
engaging or paying attention, if they themselves

941
01:13:27,290 --> 01:13:32,413
are doing so almost out of spite, or if you want
them to pay attention more, you can always watch

942
01:13:32,413 --> 01:13:39,841
them as they begin to wander and have something
really bad happen to their characters. "As Joraya

943
01:13:39,841 --> 01:13:44,288
"began to nod off in the sack in the corner, he didn't 
realize his purse strings seem to have been snipped, and

944
01:13:44,382 --> 01:13:51,336
"his coins are all missing. Oops. Maybe you
should've been paying attention, buddy." That also

945
01:13:51,336 --> 01:13:52,748
gets their attention.

946
01:13:52,748 --> 01:13:59,637
MARISHA: Let's do... yeah, you in the red dress.
Yeah, you!

947
01:13:59,637 --> 01:14:05,642
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Oh my gosh. Hi, thank you for
coming to a place that is not on the coasts.

948
01:14:05,642 --> 01:14:07,593
MATT: Thank you for having us!

949
01:14:07,593 --> 01:14:09,157
MARISHA: It's on a lake.

950
01:14:09,157 --> 01:14:20,757
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I have two questions, but since I
have to be quick, has real life events in the

951
01:14:20,757 --> 01:14:27,308
world ever affected the campaign and how you've
set it up, and if so, why?

952
01:14:27,308 --> 01:14:32,849
MATT: That's a great question. Has real world
events changed the way we've made the game.

953
01:14:32,849 --> 01:14:34,094
MARISHA: I'd say yes.

954
01:14:34,094 --> 01:14:39,756
MATT: I mean, each one of us as players have
things that happen in our lives that affect how we

955
01:14:39,756 --> 01:14:46,485
play our characters, and if any of us go through a
period of dark reality in our own world, it's hard

956
01:14:46,485 --> 01:14:50,302
to not let that bleed a little into our
characters. That's going to happen.

957
01:14:50,302 --> 01:14:59,113
MARISHA: I think when you're playing a character--
we're in these characters for generally... four

958
01:14:59,113 --> 01:15:05,490
hours a week, it's hard to not let a little bit of
that real-world influence bleed occasionally.

959
01:15:05,490 --> 01:15:09,702
MATT: Which can also be therapeutic, too. Your
frustrations can be worked through in a safe

960
01:15:09,702 --> 01:15:18,852
space, as well. As far as the overarching build of
the campaign... any of the bad stuff that's

961
01:15:18,852 --> 01:15:23,940
happening in the world around us has happened
before, for hundreds and thousands of years of

962
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:27,521
human civilization's history in different facets,
so all the great stories, all the great conflicts

963
01:15:27,521 --> 01:15:35,262
are all inspired by things that are happening or
have happened before. I can't say that things

964
01:15:35,262 --> 01:15:39,507
<i>aren't</i> influenced by it, but not directly. I'm
not trying to make a statement with any of the

965
01:15:39,507 --> 01:15:45,063
stories. I prefer to make those statements
directly, on social media, because I do have my

966
01:15:45,063 --> 01:15:48,883
own opinions and beliefs, and I wish to inspire
people to stand up for those, as well, regardless

967
01:15:48,883 --> 01:15:55,501
of which side of which spectrum you stand on. I
firmly believe that with the attention we have on

968
01:15:55,501 --> 01:16:01,088
us, we have a responsibility as figures in a space
to at least try and inspire other people to be good

969
01:16:01,088 --> 01:16:09,381
people. Whatever that means to you. I don't build
our story to be any sort of political agenda, by

970
01:16:09,381 --> 01:16:13,952
any means, but I'm sure there's influence,
regardless, because all good stories take

971
01:16:13,952 --> 01:16:15,821
influence from the world around you.

972
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:27,932
MARISHA: Yeah. That's from a DM stand. I'm sure as
a player, I know-- my therapist, actually, is

973
01:16:27,932 --> 01:16:35,141
fascinated with the game and the way that
sometimes the game will mirror our real lives

974
01:16:35,141 --> 01:16:45,288
unintentionally. For example, my therapist here
recently has been fascinated by the idea as I've

975
01:16:45,288 --> 01:16:51,257
slowly taken on leadership positions at Geek and
Sundry, and she's fascinated that Keyleth is

976
01:16:51,257 --> 01:16:57,893
slowly coming into herself as a leader as she's
completing her Aramente, so my therapist is like,

977
01:16:57,893 --> 01:17:09,942
"Holy shit. Tell me more about your D&amp;D game! I'm
a psych major, and this is insane!" I'm like, "I

978
01:17:09,942 --> 01:17:22,909
"know." I don't think it's any secret that Liam had
a really dark time last year with his mom and

979
01:17:22,909 --> 01:17:31,350
problems in his family, with her being sick. I
think it was definitely a stage that it could be

980
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:40,749
worked out on. It's hard to not let those dark
thoughts bleed sometimes. It's never intentional.

981
01:17:40,749 --> 01:17:47,299
If anyone hasn't seen The IT Crowd-- by the way, I
noticed your shirt earlier-- there's an amazing

982
01:17:47,299 --> 01:17:54,482
episode of The IT Crowd where they play D&amp;D, and
Roy has just gone through a breakup, and he's

983
01:17:54,482 --> 01:18:01,082
working out that his girlfriend that he recently
broke up with didn't really say goodbye, and he

984
01:18:01,082 --> 01:18:07,419
was left without closure, so he gets that closure
in the game. There are two great episodes, I feel,

985
01:18:07,419 --> 01:18:15,192
in modern sitcom history that do a good job at
showing what D&amp;D is succinctly, and that's the

986
01:18:15,192 --> 01:18:20,936
Community episode of D&amp;D and The IT Crowd episode
of D&amp;D, and I think they show them differently for

987
01:18:20,936 --> 01:18:30,151
both ways. The IT Crowd version shows that
therapeutic element. It's also why I'm a massive

988
01:18:30,151 --> 01:18:38,362
believer in D&amp;D being used in elementary schools
and middle schools and kids who might have social

989
01:18:38,362 --> 01:18:43,993
issues and kids who might be more on the spectrum
and leaning towards autism, because it gives them

990
01:18:43,993 --> 01:18:54,352
a stage and an acceptable, closed, basically
mock-reality situation where they can try their

991
01:18:54,352 --> 01:19:03,882
social techniques and use social dynamics without
real-world consequences, and I think that speaks

992
01:19:03,882 --> 01:19:11,361
volumes. One of the amazing things, harkening back
to a way earlier question about what are the

993
01:19:11,361 --> 01:19:18,487
benefits of bringing the show onto the internet,
is I've talked to so many educators and teachers

994
01:19:18,487 --> 01:19:26,853
and librarians who are now bringing D&amp;D and D&amp;D
clubs to the schools and for kids who might have

995
01:19:26,853 --> 01:19:38,843
more social problems, and the stories that come
back are breathtaking and awe-inspiring of these

996
01:19:38,843 --> 01:19:48,492
kids finding themselves and practicing. Just
practicing without judgment from the real world,

997
01:19:48,492 --> 01:19:52,081
and I love D&amp;D for that reason.

998
01:19:52,081 --> 01:20:02,241
(applause)

999
01:20:02,241 --> 01:20:09,481
MATT: I like to kill dragons. All right, let's see
if we can cruise through some of these questions here.

1000
01:20:09,481 --> 01:20:11,715
MARISHA: Keyleth!

1001
01:20:11,715 --> 01:20:17,994
AUDIENCE MEMBER: As a DM, how do you prevent
people from metagaming, and as a player, how do

1002
01:20:17,994 --> 01:20:19,993
you stop yourself from metagaming?

1003
01:20:19,993 --> 01:20:23,754
MATT: Good question. As a GM, how do you keep
people from metagaming? As a player, how do you

1004
01:20:23,754 --> 01:20:30,175
stop yourself from metagaming? As a GM, remind
them that they're metagaming and not to do it. If

1005
01:20:30,175 --> 01:20:33,723
it begins to happen, you can say, "you don't know
that" or "you actually don't have that

1006
01:20:33,723 --> 01:20:35,875
"information, so you can't use that in the
circumstance."

1007
01:20:35,875 --> 01:20:39,248
MARISHA: It's generally not intentional.

1008
01:20:39,248 --> 01:20:43,851
MATT: It's usually not intentional. There are some
people that might push the boundaries, and if you

1009
01:20:43,851 --> 01:20:51,883
do, then you can implement punishments for
metagaming. But talk to them first. Let them know

1010
01:20:51,883 --> 01:20:55,877
in the moment. Be like, "technically, you don't
know that" or "you're not there" or "that's

1011
01:20:55,877 --> 01:20:59,484
"information that you would not be aware of," and
if you're the player getting this, be like,

1012
01:20:59,484 --> 01:21:04,138
"you're right; never mind." Accept it. That's part
of the structure of the narrative, and that's part

1013
01:21:04,138 --> 01:21:09,488
of what makes the challenges interesting in the
game is player knowledge and character knowledge

1014
01:21:09,488 --> 01:21:14,182
being totally different things. Travis is a great
example. Travis knows a lot more of what's going

1015
01:21:14,182 --> 01:21:19,665
on, but he doesn't act on it, because he's dumb in
the game. And it's great!

1016
01:21:19,665 --> 01:21:26,323
That's my recommendation. Catch it when it happens
and politely notify, and if they keep pushing the

1017
01:21:26,323 --> 01:21:30,991
envelope on that, maybe their character suddenly
has a stroke.

1018
01:21:30,991 --> 01:21:34,028
(laughter)

1019
01:21:34,028 --> 01:21:43,433
MARISHA: Same thing. It takes practice, I think,
getting through that boundary of "nope, Keyleth

1020
01:21:43,433 --> 01:21:49,052
"doesn't know that. I know that. Keyleth doesn't
know that." It takes practice, and it's the same

1021
01:21:49,052 --> 01:21:55,987
reason why every single one of us at one point in
time over the 85 episodes we've been streaming

1022
01:21:55,987 --> 01:22:03,135
have gone, "I say this-- nope, I'm not there. I'm
not there. Shit. Sorry!" And it's never

1023
01:22:03,135 --> 01:22:10,967
intentional. I hope everyone understands that.
Just as much as everyone else can get caught up in

1024
01:22:10,967 --> 01:22:20,086
the story, so can we, and it's so easy to be like,
"I-- shit, I'm at a pub. I'm not even there. Never

1025
01:22:20,086 --> 01:22:21,482
"mind. Never mind!"

1026
01:22:21,482 --> 01:22:25,522
MATT: You always see conversations online after
certain episodes, where people mention it. "Oh,

1027
01:22:25,522 --> 01:22:29,222
"so-and-so totally metagamed that, and it really
pisses me off that this player metagames so much."

1028
01:22:29,222 --> 01:22:34,871
I'm like, "No, they don't! And if they did, so
what? We're having fun!"

1029
01:22:34,871 --> 01:22:42,982
MARISHA: It's weird the way the word metagaming
has become so vilified since we've started. For a

1030
01:22:42,982 --> 01:22:55,376
while, you thought the M-word was almost as bad as
the G-word. "Holy shit. I'm sorry! I didn't know

1031
01:22:55,376 --> 01:23:06,156
"people are taking this personally." And if you
look inward at yourself, you've probably done it,

1032
01:23:06,156 --> 01:23:15,201
too, in your game. By accident. I say try to be
cool. Be aware of it.

1033
01:23:15,201 --> 01:23:16,570
MATT: Correct it when it happens.

1034
01:23:16,570 --> 01:23:17,711
MARISHA: Yeah.

1035
01:23:17,711 --> 01:23:23,781
MATT: All right. Next question. Maybe rapid-fire.
Quick, one-sentence answers here. We'll grab a

1036
01:23:23,781 --> 01:23:27,025
bunch. Seven fingers pointing at this gentleman.
All right, fine.

1037
01:23:27,025 --> 01:23:35,017
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Me? All right. In terms of story
hooks, a lot of people advise against railroading,

1038
01:23:35,017 --> 01:23:38,667
but at the other end of the spectrum, sometimes
you need a little guidance in your campaign.

1039
01:23:38,667 --> 01:23:44,311
What's an easy way that a DM and a player can find
that middle ground, where people are interested

1040
01:23:44,311 --> 01:23:45,988
but are still moving?

1041
01:23:45,988 --> 01:23:53,799
MATT: So railroading vs open world? The trick is,
when you create a story, instead of making a

1042
01:23:53,799 --> 01:24:00,289
single line that gets you there, make bullet
points. Going to this location, talking to this

1043
01:24:00,289 --> 01:24:07,641
NPC, discovering this clue, reading this note,
finding this item, final story beat. That way, you

1044
01:24:07,641 --> 01:24:11,922
can plug those bullet points wherever they need to
be. You can still have them explore, but don't feel

1045
01:24:11,922 --> 01:24:16,511
like you're locked in and they have to find this
clue at this house. If they end up wandering too

1046
01:24:16,511 --> 01:24:20,491
far this direction, have them find the clue at
that house. Still gets them to the same point, but

1047
01:24:20,491 --> 01:24:26,222
it gives the players the agency to discover and
still wander and guide their own story. It may go

1048
01:24:26,222 --> 01:24:31,463
off the rails for a bit, but you don't want them
to completely wander off and disappear forever.

1049
01:24:31,463 --> 01:24:36,603
You can find ways to get them back by still
letting them be the ones that discovered it. Make

1050
01:24:36,603 --> 01:24:42,732
certain elements of your story hook or story
plotline flexible and able to plug in at different

1051
01:24:42,732 --> 01:24:44,982
places so they still guide where it goes.

1052
01:24:44,982 --> 01:24:50,333
MARISHA: Let's do you, since we're not sure which
the fingers were all pointing.

1053
01:24:50,333 --> 01:24:57,151
AUDIENCE MEMBER: What caused you to start creating
Exandria, and how long did you work at it before

1054
01:24:57,151 --> 01:24:59,892
you felt comfortable actually having a game inside
there?

1055
01:24:59,892 --> 01:25:03,351
MARISHA: What caused him to start creating
Exandria, and when did he feel comfortable

1056
01:25:03,351 --> 01:25:04,715
revealing it?

1057
01:25:04,715 --> 01:25:10,751
MATT: Starting Exandria happened when we finished
our one-shot and everyone went, "Let's play

1058
01:25:10,751 --> 01:25:17,698
"again!" I went, "Oh. Okay. I guess I should make
more." I'd only made Stillben. I only made the

1059
01:25:17,698 --> 01:25:23,407
single town. That's where it started. It wasn't
Exandria then. It was just Stillben, then

1060
01:25:23,407 --> 01:25:27,691
Westruun. I guess I should call this place
something. I'll call it Tal'Dorei. That sounds

1061
01:25:27,691 --> 01:25:31,401
fun. Okay, I should make a capital city for
Tal'Dorei. I'll make Emon. So as we kept playing,

1062
01:25:31,401 --> 01:25:35,351
and the further they went into the continent, I
began to build places based on where I thought the

1063
01:25:35,351 --> 01:25:39,851
story would go next, so it was this slow
connect-the-dots over the years. And then as it

1064
01:25:39,851 --> 01:25:45,422
progressed, I kept building parts to it, and
eventually, we had a show. I was like, "Oh shit, I

1065
01:25:45,422 --> 01:25:50,358
"have to make this seem like it has cohesiveness. I
should have a little more so I'm prepared and so

1066
01:25:50,358 --> 01:25:56,363
"the internet doesn't kill me." I began to expand
from there. I had the name Exandria before we

1067
01:25:56,363 --> 01:26:00,366
started streaming, but then I began to mention it,
and people were like, "Oh! I love the world. I'd

1068
01:26:00,366 --> 01:26:03,902
"love to play in it someday." I was like, "Oh, that
would be cool, I guess." And Green Ronin was like,

1069
01:26:03,902 --> 01:26:09,032
"Hey, Matt. Let's make a book." I was like, "What?
Sure, that sounds like fun. Oh god, I have to

1070
01:26:09,032 --> 01:26:14,137
"write that. I have to make all of it." When I
became comfortable releasing it? We'll see at

1071
01:26:14,137 --> 01:26:21,924
GenCon. We'll see. We'll see if everyone buys the
book and is like, "This is cool!" or "This is the

1072
01:26:21,924 --> 01:26:27,635
"<i>worst</i>!" And I'll be like, "I'm sorry! I tried!"
I hope it's not that case, but it's also my first

1073
01:26:27,635 --> 01:26:29,579
book, so we'll see. I hope it's good.

1074
01:26:29,579 --> 01:26:34,102
MARISHA: Let's do you in the plaid. Yeah.

1075
01:26:34,102 --> 01:26:44,641
AUDIENCE MEMBER: This is directed at Matt, but I
find that as a DM, balancing not only the

1076
01:26:44,641 --> 01:26:48,856
difficulty of encounters but classes with each
other is based on that four to six encounters per

1077
01:26:48,856 --> 01:26:55,183
day thing, and thematically and story-wise, a lot
of the time that seems like I'm being a dick, being

1078
01:26:55,183 --> 01:27:00,743
like, "You can't sleep because I want it to be
balanced." I noticed that you don't do that a lot,

1079
01:27:00,743 --> 01:27:05,232
and often, you have fewer encounters per long
rest. I was curious how you balance not only the

1080
01:27:05,232 --> 01:27:09,182
difficulty of the encounters but the classes among
each other.

1081
01:27:09,182 --> 01:27:15,901
MATT: I think a lot of that depends on party size,
too. The game is generally geared for about four

1082
01:27:15,901 --> 01:27:21,841
players. We have more than that. We have seven
players, sometimes eight with a guest. What that

1083
01:27:21,841 --> 01:27:28,556
does is it slows combat down, and combat can become
more of a slog if you're throwing in encounters

1084
01:27:28,556 --> 01:27:34,302
for the sake of having encounters. For me, I tend
to side more on having fewer, more interesting

1085
01:27:34,302 --> 01:27:40,124
battles than having a large series of quick
encounters, which aren't quick even if you try to

1086
01:27:40,124 --> 01:27:45,015
make it quick with that many players. It also
depends on what kind of play style you want. If

1087
01:27:45,015 --> 01:27:50,265
people like the idea of being more of a "I want to
beat shit up and take things. I want to use my

1088
01:27:50,265 --> 01:27:56,004
"class abilities in combat and be a war hero," then
that can work out really well for you to do a

1089
01:27:56,004 --> 01:28:03,802
series of rapid encounters and different unique
ways of that type of storytelling. For us, at

1090
01:28:03,802 --> 01:28:09,782
least, I prefer to do more of a lean to set-piece
battles, and certain small encounters that can

1091
01:28:09,782 --> 01:28:16,944
lead up to it, especially if it's a dungeon crawl
or for Emon, in a recent episode, they bypassed a

1092
01:28:16,944 --> 01:28:22,534
bunch of encounters that I'd prepared, but I don't
want to take away from the players for being

1093
01:28:22,534 --> 01:28:26,472
clever and bypassing circumstances and force them
into an encounter just because I made it, and

1094
01:28:26,472 --> 01:28:30,311
you're going to fight it! I don't think that's a
lot of fun.

1095
01:28:30,311 --> 01:28:34,549
So for me, the balance depends on the players,
what they're interested in, and if you feel like

1096
01:28:34,549 --> 01:28:38,219
you're throwing in three or four arbitrary battles
and the players are like, "Oh, look. Another orc

1097
01:28:38,219 --> 01:28:43,812
"ambush," then maybe you don't need to do that as
much. You're not behooven to the balance of the

1098
01:28:43,812 --> 01:28:47,761
system, because you can tweak the system to be
whatever you want it to be. I've tweaked a lot in

1099
01:28:47,761 --> 01:28:52,240
our game to make it interesting for what our play
style is. It's just a baseline. All the rules are

1100
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:56,952
guidelines for people that walk into it and need
something to work of off. The more you play and the

1101
01:28:56,952 --> 01:29:01,033
more experience you have, you can then take those
guidelines to tweak and move them to better fit

1102
01:29:01,033 --> 01:29:03,679
something that is more fun for you and your
players.

1103
01:29:03,679 --> 01:29:09,144
MARISHA: Don't you have an episode of GM Tips
that's about making encounters more difficult

1104
01:29:09,144 --> 01:29:10,889
without just giving them more hit points?

1105
01:29:10,889 --> 01:29:15,265
MATT: Yeah, I suppose. I spoke of that a little
bit, too, and I may talk more on that in the

1106
01:29:15,265 --> 01:29:20,651
future. Yeah, the idea that not every creature has
to be so powerful that it has more hit points and

1107
01:29:20,651 --> 01:29:25,212
it takes longer. You can increase their damage.
You want to make a battle to go a lot faster but

1108
01:29:25,212 --> 01:29:29,872
still feel dangerous? Have an enemy that usually
does 12 points of damage do 24 on a hit.

1109
01:29:29,872 --> 01:29:39,113
MARISHA: And like what we were saying earlier, an
enemy that does 12 hit points? That sucks. It

1110
01:29:39,113 --> 01:29:46,676
sucks way more if there's pools of lava that are
lapping up next to us, and we might get hit into

1111
01:29:46,676 --> 01:29:50,202
the lava at any point by this guy. Literally.

1112
01:29:50,202 --> 01:29:57,739
MATT: Yeah, lair actions are not exclusive to
creatures. A lair action could be a terrain

1113
01:29:57,739 --> 01:30:04,391
action, if you want to. If you have a battlefield
that has a dangerous element to it, if it has a

1114
01:30:04,391 --> 01:30:11,193
roaring lava path or there's a possible landslide
and it's very sensitive, rocky terrain that could

1115
01:30:11,193 --> 01:30:15,213
collapse at any time, you can have a counter
where if a player does a certain trigger, oops!

1116
01:30:15,213 --> 01:30:18,352
Now the battlefield is partially eroding beneath
you.

1117
01:30:18,352 --> 01:30:24,174
MARISHA: Like Vax Dimension Dooring with his cloak
and then pulling a lever, which almost led us all

1118
01:30:24,174 --> 01:30:31,972
to our doom. (laughs sarcastically) He still feels
bad about that one. "I'm going to save you guys!" Acid

1119
01:30:31,972 --> 01:30:37,182
starts filling up the room. Thanks, Vax! Thanks,
buddy.

1120
01:30:37,182 --> 01:30:39,672
MATT: I was like, "This is going to be an
great villain exit moment when he hits the

1121
01:30:39,672 --> 01:30:44,529
"button." And nope, their friend's going to do it
for them. That's so much more delicious!

1122
01:30:44,529 --> 01:30:54,272
MARISHA: Like face-planting in lava, nothing's
worse than being like, "I'm coming to save you!"

1123
01:30:54,272 --> 01:31:03,215
(grunting) Nothing's worse than that. "I'm going
to be a hero--"

1124
01:31:03,215 --> 01:31:13,621
MATT: But what a gracious way to die. I think
we've got time for one more question.

1125
01:31:13,621 --> 01:31:16,341
MARISHA: And we're signing from 7:30 to 9:30?

1126
01:31:16,341 --> 01:31:17,602
OFFSCREEN VOICE: 7:30 to 9:30.

1127
01:31:17,602 --> 01:31:19,302
MATT: 7:30 to 9:30 we're signing tonight.

1128
01:31:19,302 --> 01:31:21,802
MARISHA: We can go a little bit over. I just have
to pee at some point soon.

1129
01:31:21,802 --> 01:31:24,401
MATT and MARISHA: We'll do a couple more.

1130
01:31:24,401 --> 01:31:31,481
MARISHA: Oh, there's a panel here at 7:00. Okay,
we'll do a couple more questions. Okay! Yes, you,

1131
01:31:31,481 --> 01:31:33,824
with the curly hair. Yeah!

1132
01:31:33,824 --> 01:31:41,711
AUDIENCE MEMBER: As a DM, I've had situations
where I've had the big badass guy that they're

1133
01:31:41,711 --> 01:31:47,485
going to fight and then they completely destroy
him, completely steamroll him. I was wondering if

1134
01:31:47,485 --> 01:31:54,840
there was any situation as a player where you did
that, completely steamrolled somebody that was

1135
01:31:54,840 --> 01:31:58,418
supposed to be badass, and as a GM, how can you
stop that?

1136
01:31:58,418 --> 01:32:00,652
MATT: As a player, that has definitely happened.

1137
01:32:00,652 --> 01:32:08,272
MARISHA: It's so awesome. Every time. I remember--
and I feel like people forget about it a lot, but we

1138
01:32:08,272 --> 01:32:14,310
totally avoided an entire encounter when we were
going into the Fire Plane, and then I turned into

1139
01:32:14,310 --> 01:32:21,312
a fire elemental and used my Ignan language to be
like, "I'm bigger and better than you. Go back to

1140
01:32:21,312 --> 01:32:27,061
"where you came from!" And they were like, "Yeah,
okay," and walked away. We avoided an entire

1141
01:32:27,061 --> 01:32:31,660
encounter with a bunch of fire elementals by doing
that. That was dope.

1142
01:32:31,660 --> 01:32:35,770
MATT: That was pretty rad, and as far as players,
yeah. I've done it in previous campaigns, and

1143
01:32:35,770 --> 01:32:41,952
there is something delightful about the palpable
frustration on the GM's face. Comparatively, if

1144
01:32:41,952 --> 01:32:46,842
you've built a lot to it and want the villain to
really make an impact, consider: an intelligent

1145
01:32:46,842 --> 01:32:52,336
villain will have an escape path. Not every battle
has to be fought to the bitter end, and a smart

1146
01:32:52,336 --> 01:32:59,050
enemy knows that if they're losing to run and come
back later much more prepared. Consider ways to escape.

1147
01:32:59,050 --> 01:33:01,049
MARISHA: Unless they're Feebleminded.

1148
01:33:01,049 --> 01:33:11,014
(laughter and applause)

1149
01:33:11,014 --> 01:33:14,640
MARISHA: I never thought that would work for a
million years. Never thought it would work.

1150
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:19,518
MATT: But that's a perfect example. You don't want
to rob the players of a good, clever victory, too.

1151
01:33:19,518 --> 01:33:25,714
If your players do really well and surprise you
and steamroll a powerful guy, good on them! And

1152
01:33:25,714 --> 01:33:29,471
let them know, "Wow, you guys really stepped up."
And learn from that adventure, and the next

1153
01:33:29,471 --> 01:33:35,981
villain they fight is going to destroy <i>them</i>. But
think of escape mechanisms. Especially if it's a

1154
01:33:35,981 --> 01:33:39,881
home-turf advantage for the villain, what could
they have established or built or prepared in that

1155
01:33:39,881 --> 01:33:45,591
home turf to better their advantage in the combat?
What happens if all of a sudden they have a way of

1156
01:33:45,591 --> 01:33:49,276
closing off half the party, where now they're only
fighting half of the adventurers and the others

1157
01:33:49,276 --> 01:33:52,662
are locked away, fighting some other creature
that's in this chamber they got teleported toward,

1158
01:33:52,662 --> 01:33:57,349
and they can't go and help until they defeat what
that thing is. That's <i>horrifying</i> for a party,

1159
01:33:57,349 --> 01:34:01,849
especially when they've built up their dynamic as
players to work well as a cohesive unit, and you

1160
01:34:01,849 --> 01:34:10,005
divide the unit? That's so scary! And <i>awesome</i> as
a GM! So think of those clever villains, what they

1161
01:34:10,005 --> 01:34:14,851
could use to their advantage, and how could they
escape if things go poorly, and if they manage to

1162
01:34:14,851 --> 01:34:19,522
escape, what are they going to bring back next
time to be sure that it goes in their favor? And

1163
01:34:19,522 --> 01:34:24,623
sometimes it doesn't happen. The dice ultimately
run the game, and you have to accept that.

1164
01:34:24,623 --> 01:34:26,706
MARISHA: (coughs) Ripley. (coughs)

1165
01:34:26,706 --> 01:34:30,843
MATT: Ripley's a perfect example of a really smart
villain that knew exactly what to set up, and it

1166
01:34:30,843 --> 01:34:33,182
worked out great and almost killed the entire
party, and it was awesome.

1167
01:34:33,182 --> 01:34:35,136
(laughter)

1168
01:34:35,136 --> 01:34:36,660
MATT: I was very happy with that encounter.

1169
01:34:36,660 --> 01:34:38,042
MARISHA: We fell for every bait.

1170
01:34:38,042 --> 01:34:42,321
MATT: You did! Every single step! I couldn't hide
my smile.

1171
01:34:42,321 --> 01:34:45,484
MARISHA: Following Percy.

1172
01:34:45,484 --> 01:34:47,166
MATT: I know.

1173
01:34:47,166 --> 01:34:53,911
MARISHA: All right, let's do you with the peach
phone that you're holding up.

1174
01:34:53,911 --> 01:34:58,322
AUDIENCE MEMBER: All right, so my boyfriend's at
home sick with the flu. He really wished he could

1175
01:34:58,322 --> 01:34:59,389
be here.

1176
01:34:59,389 --> 01:35:02,432
MARISHA: Everyone's sick, man. It's going around.

1177
01:35:02,432 --> 01:35:08,286
AUDIENCE MEMBER: The question he has is: How does
everyone in your game have bonus actions, and if it's

1178
01:35:08,286 --> 01:35:13,913
homebrew, how do you make it up for the classes
that didn't have bonus actions?

1179
01:35:13,913 --> 01:35:18,483
MATT: Generally, if you have something in your
class that can use a bonus action, that's how you

1180
01:35:18,483 --> 01:35:24,532
get to it. It's not like everybody has a bonus
action, but certain things can utilize that. We

1181
01:35:24,532 --> 01:35:30,043
have a couple of homebrew things. One, we
homebrewed it that potions can be used as a bonus

1182
01:35:30,043 --> 01:35:34,835
action as opposed to an action, because nothing's
worse when you have a large party and you

1183
01:35:34,835 --> 01:35:38,604
have to wait six or seven player turns and enemy
turns to get to your turn and you're like, "All

1184
01:35:38,604 --> 01:35:43,795
"right, cool. I drink a potion. That's it." If
you've waited 30 minutes and that's all you do,

1185
01:35:43,795 --> 01:35:47,550
that sucks, so I decided as an option-- which is
one of the things I mentioned in the campaign

1186
01:35:47,550 --> 01:35:52,310
guide as one of the optional rules-- adjusting
some things to make combat go faster or have

1187
01:35:52,310 --> 01:35:56,663
players feel like they can do more with their
turn, if you're running a faster game or a larger

1188
01:35:56,663 --> 01:36:01,013
party. And I also just noticed there's a Dr. McNinja
behind you, and that's awesome. Well done. But

1189
01:36:01,013 --> 01:36:08,093
yeah, so that's one. Also, and I toyed with it a
bit, being able to cast--

1190
01:36:08,093 --> 01:36:11,253
MARISHA: 2nd-level spells.

1191
01:36:11,253 --> 01:36:16,212
MATT: 2nd-level spells, as well as any other spell
in the same round. Usually, as the rules are

1192
01:36:16,212 --> 01:36:23,372
written, you can only cast one 1st-level spell or
higher per round, and a cantrip. There's a

1193
01:36:23,372 --> 01:36:28,157
metamagic ability that sorcerers have where you can
spend sorcery points to make a quickened spell,

1194
01:36:28,239 --> 01:36:32,976
where you can cast a spell that usually takes an
action as a bonus action. You can cast two spells

1195
01:36:32,976 --> 01:36:37,647
in one round, but you're still limited that one of
them has to be a cantrip, and the other can be any

1196
01:36:37,647 --> 01:36:41,627
type of spell. Well, when you have a lot of
players, as well, that can be frustrating for the

1197
01:36:41,627 --> 01:36:49,088
same reasons that the potion is difficult, so I
made it to try it out. You can cast two spells in

1198
01:36:49,088 --> 01:36:53,025
the same round, as long as one of them is
2nd-level or lower. That does enable more bonus

1199
01:36:53,025 --> 01:36:56,348
actions than would normally be there. So we do
have some homebrew elements that we do put into

1200
01:36:56,348 --> 01:36:59,355
the game, partially because I wanted to try them
out and see how it worked, and the system was new

1201
01:36:59,355 --> 01:37:06,413
to us, and also because we wanted to keep combat
more useful and let the players feel like they

1202
01:37:06,413 --> 01:37:08,915
were doing more with their actual rounds than they
normally do.

1203
01:37:08,915 --> 01:37:15,416
MARISHA: Technically, every time I do a Grasping
Vine, I should only be able to do a cantrip, but

1204
01:37:15,416 --> 01:37:19,520
that would be lame, so we do Grasping Vine, and I
can do a 2nd-level or lower.

1205
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:25,069
MATT: That's actually one of the feats in the book
that I put in there, an optional feat. If you

1206
01:37:25,069 --> 01:37:30,140
don't want to make it a baseline rule in your
game, you can have somebody take the feat, and it

1207
01:37:30,140 --> 01:37:34,781
allows them to do that, and it has a prerequisite
as part of it where you have to be a certain level

1208
01:37:34,781 --> 01:37:40,180
so you aren't taking the feat at first level and
breaking the game at the lower levels. I found

1209
01:37:40,180 --> 01:37:42,136
ways to implement it and balance it.

1210
01:37:42,136 --> 01:37:45,937
MARISHA: We're at level 17 now, most of us.

1211
01:37:45,937 --> 01:37:50,900
MATT: You're all 16, almost on 17. (singing) You
are 16, going on 17.

1212
01:37:50,900 --> 01:37:52,837
(laughter)

1213
01:37:52,837 --> 01:38:04,120
MARISHA: Yeah, so we're pretty beefy. I know
that's another thing that's ended up happening,

1214
01:38:04,120 --> 01:38:09,347
but when we started the stream, we were level
seven or level eight, but now there's been a

1215
01:38:09,347 --> 01:38:14,862
decent amount of new people who have come in and
been like, "Jesus Christ, they're fighting pit

1216
01:38:14,862 --> 01:38:20,666
"fiends?" Yeah, we're pretty beefy, at that point.

1217
01:38:20,666 --> 01:38:24,786
MATT: Hope that answered your question. All
right.

1218
01:38:24,786 --> 01:38:27,878
OFFSCREEN VOICE: All right. Unfortunately, there's
a panel at 7:00.

1219
01:38:27,878 --> 01:38:30,757
MATT: Yeah, we've got to clear the room for the
next panel, guys.

1220
01:38:30,757 --> 01:38:32,358
MARISHA: This has been good, though!

1221
01:38:32,358 --> 01:38:37,433
(cheering and applause)

1222
01:38:37,433 --> 01:39:23,701
