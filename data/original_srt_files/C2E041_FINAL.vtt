NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.689
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:07.836
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons & Dragons. Travis is in-transit, don't

00:00:07.836 --> 00:00:10.594
freak out. He'll be here in just a moment. He's
making his way here from--

00:00:10.594 --> 00:00:12.071
LAURA: He's busy this week.

00:00:12.071 --> 00:00:14.631
SAM: He couldn't stand to face Laura.

00:00:14.631 --> 00:00:15.993
LAURA: That's right.

00:00:15.993 --> 00:00:20.793
MATT: Well, if he knew what was good for him.
Before we get into tonight's episode, let's go

00:00:20.793 --> 00:00:24.645
into some quick announcements. First and foremost,
our fantastic returning sponsors for this

00:00:24.645 --> 00:00:29.111
campaign, our friends, our dear family at D&D
Beyond. Sam.

00:00:29.111 --> 00:00:36.623
SAM: Everybody, our trip to the UK changed us in a
lot of ways. We were exposed to the European

00:00:36.623 --> 00:00:47.600
culture and that area of the world. We fell in
love with it. Tonight, there's so much to talk

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.566
about that I'm going to need some help. Everyone
knows Matt's Scottish accent is top notch, but

00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:59.015
I've been studying with a dialect coach that I
found on Craigslist and I think I'm ready to

00:00:59.015 --> 00:01:06.914
unveil my Scottish brogue. Now, because it's so
accurate, Matt's going to translate what I'm

00:01:06.914 --> 00:01:12.440
saying. I'm going to be saying things in
traditional, accurate Scottish about D&D Beyond

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.955
that he'll translate into American English.

00:01:15.955 --> 00:01:17.577
TALIESIN: I'm weirdly on-board.

00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:22.322
SAM: Okay, here we go. (exaggerated Scottish
accent) Hallo, ya bonnie lassies and laddies!

00:01:22.523 --> 00:01:27.014
Don't be a <i>wee dafty. Ma kelly ann's</i> been
<i>haverin</i> how D&D Beyond is the <i>maest braw app up</i>

00:01:27.014 --> 00:01:29.548
<i>tae hae though.</i>

00:01:29.548 --> 00:01:36.265
MATT: (pause, laughter) D&D Beyond is proud to announce the
continuation of the Waterdeep campaign. Dungeon of

00:01:36.265 --> 00:01:39.696
the Mad Mage is out tonight at 9:00pm Pacific.

00:01:39.696 --> 00:01:47.245
SAM: <i>Nae! I cannae be aff ma heed!</i> It's <i>Taps
Aff cos eh</i> D&D and Magic: The Gathering, <i>ya numpty!</i>

00:01:47.245 --> 00:01:52.641
MATT: The long-awaited Magic: The Gathering / D&D
crossover, Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica, also

00:01:52.862 --> 00:01:55.717
drops tonight at 9:00pm Pacific time.

00:01:55.717 --> 00:02:01.470
SAM: <i>Haud yer wheesht</i> and <i>nick it now or yer
fit to be getting skelp, ya herpuin jobbie.</i>

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.544
MATT: You can get both at
dndbeyond.com/marketplace.

00:02:05.544 --> 00:02:10.794
SAM: (regular voice) Oh, it's my turn! Oh no,
that's your line. Wait, that's my line. Okay.

00:02:10.794 --> 00:02:15.450
(exaggerated Scottish accent) What ya doin the
weekend? <i>Jings!</i> You're a right <i>hoodie dobber,</i>

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.588

00:02:18.588 --> 00:02:24.134
MATT: D&D Beyond is hosting a two-day streaming
event this Friday and Saturday at Gamehole Con to

00:02:24.134 --> 00:02:25.612
benefit Extra Life.

00:02:25.612 --> 00:02:33.218
SAM: Ach! Where are <i>Jock Tamson's bairns?</i> It's
quality! I'm pure <i>scunnered</i>. (regular voice) I

00:02:33.218 --> 00:02:35.852
looked these words up! They're real.

00:02:35.852 --> 00:02:42.187
MATT: Both days will feature three, four-hour
sessions from 7:30am-- 7:30pm to 10:30--

00:02:42.187 --> 00:02:42.849
SAM: a.m.!

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.771
MATT: All? Wow! From 7:30am to 10:00pm with
special guests raising money for a special cause.

00:02:47.771 --> 00:02:49.508
LIAM: It's throwing him that badly.

00:02:49.508 --> 00:02:50.375
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:02:50.375 --> 00:02:54.403
[hat plays tinny, high-pitched "Scotland the Brave"]

00:02:54.403 --> 00:02:57.035
SAM: Okay. (exaggerated Scottish accent) Call me
<i>doonie</i>, get on yer trolley and <i>heed</i> over to

00:03:02.005 --> 00:03:07.398
MATT: Be sure to tune into twitch.tv/dndbeyond to
check it out.

00:03:07.398 --> 00:03:09.644
[hat music continues]

00:03:09.644 --> 00:03:11.486
MARISHA: That was not what I was expecting!

00:03:11.486 --> 00:03:13.694
LAURA: Does it ever stop?

00:03:13.694 --> 00:03:16.386
SAM: (regular voice) I don't know when it stops!

00:03:16.386 --> 00:03:19.100
LAURA: Help! Make it end!

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.157
SAM: Don't press it again; it'll start again!
Maybe it's winding down. Ah!

00:03:24.157 --> 00:03:26.152
LAURA: Yay!

00:03:26.152 --> 00:03:28.000
MATT: Thank you, Sam.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.253
SAM: Well, you know. We love London, we love UK,
we love it all.

00:03:32.253 --> 00:03:39.360
MATT: My distant ancestry is extremely pleased
with your performance. Thank you, D&D Beyond, as always.

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:41.362
LIAM: What is "to high doh?"

00:03:41.362 --> 00:03:50.874
SAM: "To high doh," to high, though. It means
something? All these words are real. "Up to high

00:03:50.874 --> 00:03:54.040
"doh" means a lot? I don't know!

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:02.073
MATT: Guide to Ravnica. The next episode of All
Work No Play will debut this Friday at

00:04:02.073 --> 00:04:08.544
twitch.tv/criticalrole at 7:00pm Pacific. This
week, Liam and Sam are building a custom MAME

00:04:08.544 --> 00:04:17.257
cabinet with Felicia Day and our fantastic
Director of Events, Brittany Walloch. MAME

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:22.215
cabinets, something I've been chasing my whole
life, and finally there is one in my vicinity.

00:04:22.215 --> 00:04:24.015
SAM: Felicia joins us.

00:04:24.015 --> 00:04:30.599
MATT: Awesome. Check that out Friday. Also,
through the month of November, and in celebration

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:35.821
of Veterans Day, we're raising money for Travis'
favorite charity, Operation Supply Drop. We've

00:04:35.821 --> 00:04:40.480
talked about it before. We put up the account, you
guys have already raised a tremendous amount of

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:47.340
money for this. As much as we can get the word out
before the donation period closes, continue to

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:53.659
help them. Operation Supply Drop has already
helped over 750,000 members of the military

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:57.788
community since its inception. It continues to
support active military members, veterans, their

00:04:57.788 --> 00:05:03.714
families. It's amazing, the work they do. We're
big fans of everything they do. Check out all the

00:05:03.714 --> 00:05:12.618
information to donate now at critrole.com/osd.
Also, both the standard and deluxe editions of our

00:05:12.618 --> 00:05:19.887
second art book, The Chronicles of Exandria,
Legend of Vox Machina, will be on sale via

00:05:19.887 --> 00:05:26.167
pre-order this coming Monday, November 12, at
9:00am Pacific. This art book contains art from

00:05:26.167 --> 00:05:31.904
our fantastic, beloved community of critter
artists. They've all put it together with love and

00:05:31.904 --> 00:05:39.544
joy and I'm super proud of it. These guys, like,
died to get it done. The number of artists-- you

00:05:39.544 --> 00:05:43.043
guys did incredible work. We're excited for you
guys to check it out, and super excited to

00:05:43.043 --> 00:05:48.544
announce, for our European critters, the art book
will be shipped out to our brand new fulfillment

00:05:48.544 --> 00:05:56.203
center.in the United Kingdom that we just set up!
A lot of hard work to finally get a fulfilment

00:05:56.203 --> 00:06:01.705
center that side. This will drastically reduce
shipping costs and delivery times for our European

00:06:01.705 --> 00:06:06.817
family out there. Super stoked to have this
finally functional. We'll have more details to

00:06:06.817 --> 00:06:10.188
that available on Monday morning when all this
goes on sale.

00:06:10.188 --> 00:06:13.329
SAM: Should I translate what you just said for our
Scottish audience?

00:06:13.329 --> 00:06:14.880
MATT: Do I have a choice?

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:15.701
SAM: No.

00:06:15.701 --> 00:06:20.615
LIAM: I'm going to show off an image from inside
the book. This is the standard, by the way. Matteo

00:06:20.615 --> 00:06:25.342
Scalera, an artist that I fell in love with
reading the Black Science comic book. He's fucking

00:06:25.342 --> 00:06:26.682
amazing and the cover is--

00:06:26.682 --> 00:06:28.215
SAM: That's the standard?

00:06:28.215 --> 00:06:29.610
LIAM: This is the standard.

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.010
SAM: Holy shit, that's good.

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:35.382
LIAM: This book is so beautiful. Show that thing
off and I'm going to find a picture.

00:06:35.382 --> 00:06:37.410
TALIESIN: Yeah, this is the beautiful deluxe
edition which comes with a little ribbon and you

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:43.829
can see this wonderful cover art with Vecna in the
center and the four gods depicted in the corners

00:06:43.829 --> 00:06:45.940
all cowering before his might.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.206
MATT: The four major deities that were involved in
that final arc.

00:06:49.206 --> 00:06:52.947
LIAM: I'm going to show off a little Ioun. Look at
this!

00:06:52.947 --> 00:06:55.312
LAURA: Oh my god!

00:06:55.312 --> 00:06:57.765
TALIESIN: Who are these lovely kids right over
here?

00:06:57.765 --> 00:06:59.653
LAURA: Oh my god!

00:06:59.653 --> 00:07:03.516
TALIESIN: It's right there.

00:07:03.516 --> 00:07:09.041
MATT: Just like that, it goes away. Look forward
to the information about that this coming Monday

00:07:09.041 --> 00:07:16.514
at critrole.com. I believe those are all of our
announcements, and with that, let's go ahead and

00:07:16.514 --> 00:07:21.795
jump into tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:07:23.735 --> 00:07:28.366
[TV static, click]

00:07:28.366 --> 00:08:44.959
[groovy Critical Role theme]

00:08:45.522 --> 00:08:53.994
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome back. Last we
left off: The Mighty Nein, after making a daring

00:08:53.994 --> 00:09:01.347
escape from the Temple of the False Serpent on the
island of Urukaxl had managed to nearly drown in

00:09:01.637 --> 00:09:06.749
the escape, make their way through the jungle
being chased by both yuan-ti and the lizardmen

00:09:06.749 --> 00:09:14.125
denizens of this island. Making their way to the
shore just in time to have the actual pirate ship,

00:09:14.125 --> 00:09:20.889
the Squalleater, there to defend you. Firing
various heavy cannonballs towards the creatures

00:09:20.889 --> 00:09:29.201
which had given chase and allowing you to escape
on the boats to safety. Upon reaching the top of

00:09:29.201 --> 00:09:34.243
the ship you found that the Mistake has been
repaired enough to be seaworthy, though it does

00:09:34.243 --> 00:09:42.797
need some more intense repairs. Your supplies are
relatively low, and it looks like the current

00:09:42.797 --> 00:09:50.417
goal is to find your journey westward to the island
of Darktow which has been wiped-- from your

00:09:50.511 --> 00:09:56.487
knowledge-- wiped from the Clovis Concord's
control many years ago and currently resides as

00:09:56.487 --> 00:10:04.377
the center of all piracy in the Lucidian Ocean. As
you all went to rest for the evening, Fjord-- who

00:10:04.377 --> 00:10:10.681
will be here shortly, so I can continue to
embarrass him-- had an evening's conversation with

00:10:10.681 --> 00:10:23.432
Captain Avantika, in which it was discussed his
past history with his childhood father figure, who

00:10:23.503 --> 00:10:29.504
also seemed to have a history with Avantika as
well and is somehow rolled in with this strange

00:10:29.717 --> 00:10:42.814
Uk'otoa phenomenon. It also came to light that
this shipwreck which gave Fjord his powers might

00:10:42.814 --> 00:10:48.555
have a connection, based on the Captain's
intuition, with where this third and final sphere

00:10:48.555 --> 00:10:55.646
may lie, and it was decided between the two of
them that this may be the next goal, beyond

00:10:55.646 --> 00:10:59.423
Darktow, to pursue. After which, they fucked.

00:10:59.423 --> 00:11:03.247
LAURA: (screaming)

00:11:03.247 --> 00:11:07.797
(laughter)

00:11:07.817 --> 00:11:16.260
MATT: While that era of the story is transpiring,
I want to ask you guys, since we have a moment here--

00:11:16.885 --> 00:11:18.022
LIAM: While they're fucking?

00:11:18.022 --> 00:11:22.683
MATT: Or in the loose, wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey
period of figuring things out as you recover from

00:11:22.683 --> 00:11:27.962
the intense return to the ship. What would you
like to do? Is there anything you want to check up

00:11:27.962 --> 00:11:29.980
on? First of all, everyone leveled up to seven.

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:32.759
LAURA: Did we get a long rest after?

00:11:32.759 --> 00:11:36.224
MATT: This would be the long rest-- for everyone
but Fjord, I guess.

00:11:36.224 --> 00:11:43.447
SAM: Nice. This isn't the next few days of our
sailing adventure, this is that night?

00:11:43.447 --> 00:11:47.785
MATT: This is that night. We will then begin to
embark on what that journey will be, but if

00:11:47.785 --> 00:11:50.667
there's anything you wish to do before the
evening's done.

00:11:50.667 --> 00:11:56.037
TALIESIN: I already gave my shade, I'm done.
Honestly, that was all I needed.

00:11:56.037 --> 00:12:03.656
LIAM: I would try to locate Caduceus on the boat,
actually. I don't know if he's hiding or not.

00:12:03.656 --> 00:12:11.170
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm in my room because I was-- is
this before Fjord came back?

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:13.574
MATT: We can say this is while Fjord is out.

00:12:13.574 --> 00:12:15.670
TALIESIN: Okay, so I'm in my room.

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:20.680
LIAM: I will go to where he is on the boat and--
(knocking).

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:25.521
TALIESIN: Hey, Mister Caleb. Good evening.

00:12:25.521 --> 00:12:27.419
LIAM: You look--

00:12:27.419 --> 00:12:28.828
TALIESIN: Battered.

00:12:28.828 --> 00:12:33.285
LIAM: Tired as I feel. Do you have a moment?

00:12:33.285 --> 00:12:37.291
TALIESIN: Sure. What can I do for you?

00:12:37.291 --> 00:12:39.853
LIAM: May I come in?

00:12:39.853 --> 00:12:41.764
TALIESIN: Oh, yes. Of course.

00:12:41.764 --> 00:12:54.783
LIAM: (clears throat) I feel a little poorly for
the time you have been having, traveling with us.

00:12:54.783 --> 00:13:07.138
It was not a very good day. It's been a string of
bad ones, in fact, and I am grateful to have you

00:13:07.138 --> 00:13:17.514
along with this group because we get hurt a lot
and stick our noses places maybe we shouldn't. You

00:13:17.514 --> 00:13:19.272
have been very helpful.

00:13:19.272 --> 00:13:28.858
TALIESIN: I think I'm coming to the realization
that perhaps I was not entirely clear on what I

00:13:28.858 --> 00:13:37.930
signed up for, but I don't think that means that
it's the wrong path. I'm getting used to the idea

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:42.698
that it wouldn't be a test if it were easy.

00:13:42.698 --> 00:13:48.205
LIAM: Is it your intention to continue on with
us?

00:13:48.205 --> 00:14:01.494
TALIESIN: I... I joined your group of friends-- I guess
our group of friends, now-- as a testament of

00:14:01.494 --> 00:14:10.397
faith, and it would be a disservice to that faith
to turn around because it's hard. If it'd have

00:14:10.397 --> 00:14:18.683
been easy, I suppose I wouldn't have been needed
to be called to it. I've been thinking a lot about

00:14:18.683 --> 00:14:23.006
it. Jester gave me a lot to think about, to be
honest.

00:14:23.006 --> 00:14:32.391
LIAM: Well, sometimes acts of good faith deserve
to be rewarded, when they can. I wanted to give

00:14:32.391 --> 00:14:41.382
you something that will make your time with us a
little bit easier, I suppose. I start to pull the

00:14:41.382 --> 00:14:51.524
periapt out and untie it. This-- you know, I'm
always so far back away from-- I hear you, Laura,

00:14:51.524 --> 00:15:00.447
in my peripheral, I hear you. I'm always very far
back anyway, this isn't doing me much good, and

00:15:00.447 --> 00:15:10.784
it's better that you stay up more than I stay up
because if you go down, that's it. This is a

00:15:10.784 --> 00:15:17.078
little bit of extra protection-- anyway.

00:15:17.078 --> 00:15:26.939
TALIESIN: Mister Caleb, do you believe in fate?
There are lots of different kinds of fate; I know

00:15:27.183 --> 00:15:35.866
that's a heavy question, but do you believe that
we are driven towards something by things that are

00:15:35.866 --> 00:15:37.626
greater than ourselves?

00:15:37.626 --> 00:15:43.226
(background music)

00:15:43.226 --> 00:15:51.647
LIAM: I don't know. I would like to think not, but
I don't know.

00:15:54.082 --> 00:15:59.437
TALIESIN: There are times that I think about the
cruelties of the world and the things that have

00:15:59.437 --> 00:16:10.271
been put upon me and my family, and I would hate
for that to be a plan, and there are times when,

00:16:10.271 --> 00:16:20.561
like today, I'm very grateful for being in the
right place at the right time to make sure that

00:16:20.561 --> 00:16:31.525
the right people are becoming strong in ways they
need to be. I don't think that excuses the pain, I

00:16:31.525 --> 00:16:38.768
don't think that you have to-- I don't know, I
don't think that you have to not care about it or

00:16:38.768 --> 00:16:46.921
fight it with everything you've got, but I think
the world is shaping you into something important,

00:16:46.921 --> 00:16:49.645
and I want to make sure that you get to wherever
you need to be.

00:16:52.125 --> 00:16:54.281
LIAM: That's a pretty big matzo ball.

00:16:54.281 --> 00:17:00.852
TALIESIN: You won't have to work very hard at it,
I imagine. I think just being you wherever the

00:17:00.852 --> 00:17:02.765
world puts you will do just fine.

00:17:02.765 --> 00:17:08.647
LIAM: If you have this-- this is magic, by the
way.

00:17:08.647 --> 00:17:10.219
TALIESIN: I can tell.

00:17:10.219 --> 00:17:11.741
LIAM: Here you go.

00:17:11.741 --> 00:17:13.447
TALIESIN: Thank you.

00:17:13.447 --> 00:17:16.841
LIAM: I help you, that makes it easier to help all
of us.

00:17:16.841 --> 00:17:25.444
TALIESIN: I promise I will continue to help you
all. Even when we're not the best of people, I

00:17:25.444 --> 00:17:32.297
feel like we're still moving towards something
that's good and worthwhile, and I'm feeling the

00:17:32.297 --> 00:17:36.320
struggle's in my way to bring us to where we need
to be.

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.924
LIAM: Welcome to the Nein.

00:17:38.924 --> 00:17:41.293
TALIESIN: I'm honored.

00:17:41.293 --> 00:17:46.097
LIAM: Okay, I feel like shit, so I'm going to go
to bed.

00:17:46.097 --> 00:17:49.518
TALIESIN: Thank you for this, I won't forget it.

00:17:51.828 --> 00:17:54.548
(chair scrape)

00:17:54.548 --> 00:17:56.261
MARISHA: Just like Fjord.

00:17:56.261 --> 00:18:02.617
(laughter)

00:18:03.107 --> 00:18:04.432
TALIESIN: Meanwhile, one hour later.

00:18:04.432 --> 00:18:06.373
LIAM: Rolling them double ones.

00:18:06.373 --> 00:18:08.841
MATT: You get to remove that item, and you get to
add it to your--

00:18:08.841 --> 00:18:10.038
TALIESIN: I'm adding which item?

00:18:10.038 --> 00:18:12.907
LIAM: Periapt of wound closure. It just feels
right that it's with you.

00:18:12.907 --> 00:18:14.899
SAM: What does it do?

00:18:14.899 --> 00:18:18.928
LIAM: Makes it harder for him to die. It was
Molly's.

00:18:18.928 --> 00:18:29.867
MARISHA: I'm going to go to Caleb when he gets
back. (knocking) Caleb! Caleb! Caleb!

00:18:29.867 --> 00:18:32.462
LIAM: Where's my owl?

00:18:32.462 --> 00:18:44.778
MARISHA: Oh, right! It doesn't drown, it's
amazing. It's like it's magic or something. We had

00:18:44.778 --> 00:18:45.975
good times.

00:18:45.975 --> 00:18:47.914
LIAM: You have three or four more days, if you
want.

00:18:47.914 --> 00:18:48.962
MARISHA: Do I?!

00:18:48.962 --> 00:18:50.614
LIAM: Yeah, I--

00:18:50.614 --> 00:18:53.250
MARISHA: Can you do me a favor?

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:55.200
MATT: Pocketed.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.480
MARISHA: Pocket owl. Right next to my bacon.

00:18:58.480 --> 00:18:59.188
LIAM: iOwl.

00:18:59.188 --> 00:19:08.240
MARISHA: I got this red feather from Nila-- and I
don't know, when she handed it to me, she was

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:17.533
like-- very deliberate on how she handed it to me.
Will you just see if it's magic?

00:19:17.533 --> 00:19:20.876
LIAM: You want to know if this is something? Do
you have a moment?

00:19:20.876 --> 00:19:21.836
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:19:21.836 --> 00:19:26.239
LIAM: Okay. I will cast Identify on this.

00:19:26.239 --> 00:19:29.877
MATT: It is not magical, it is sentimental.

00:19:29.877 --> 00:19:36.911
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, that's a feather. That's just a
feather. It's good looking, though.

00:19:36.911 --> 00:19:46.642
MARISHA: Tie it to my staff. I'm not
disappointed.

00:19:46.642 --> 00:19:47.753
LIAM: Okay.

00:19:47.753 --> 00:19:50.121
MARISHA: I'm not disappointed!

00:19:50.121 --> 00:19:51.497
LIAM: Are you good?

00:19:51.497 --> 00:19:55.301
MARISHA: I'm-- bye. I'm going to go to bed.

00:19:55.301 --> 00:19:59.951
LAURA: Can I pull out Sprinkle?

00:19:59.951 --> 00:20:14.476
MATT: Okay. As you reach back into your
waterlogged hood of your coat, you hear this tiny

00:20:14.476 --> 00:20:24.376
little (coughing) and there you pull out this
extremely waterlogged and unhappy crimson weasel.

00:20:24.376 --> 00:20:28.949
(chittering and coughing)

00:20:28.949 --> 00:20:33.976
LAURA: You're so tough, Sprinkle. I'm going to
squish his little cheeks.

00:20:33.976 --> 00:20:35.776
MATT: He pees in your hand.

00:20:35.776 --> 00:20:44.688
LAURA: Oh, thank you. Okay, go right to your--
stay there. Don't drown, okay? Then I'm going to

00:20:44.688 --> 00:20:52.067
look for Beau, but she's not around, so then I'm
going to go look for Nott.

00:20:52.067 --> 00:20:54.806
SAM: I'm drinking.

00:20:54.806 --> 00:20:57.191
MATT and LAURA: Where are you drinking?

00:20:57.191 --> 00:21:00.321
SAM: I don't know where. Are we all staying in the
room or do we have a couple of rooms?

00:21:00.321 --> 00:21:04.179
MATT: There are three rooms between the group, I
think, that have been given to you and the people

00:21:04.179 --> 00:21:06.877
that have been moved to the Mistake.

00:21:06.877 --> 00:21:08.871
SAM: Let's say that I'm drinking on the deck of
the ship.

00:21:08.871 --> 00:21:15.591
LAURA: Oh good. I was on the deck of the ship,
too. How perfect. Hey, Nott.

00:21:15.591 --> 00:21:16.643
SAM: Hi.

00:21:16.643 --> 00:21:19.604
LAURA: Hi. Are you super wasted?

00:21:19.604 --> 00:21:21.542
SAM: I've got a good buzz on.

00:21:21.542 --> 00:21:24.193
LAURA: Okay. I have a question for you.

00:21:24.193 --> 00:21:25.130
SAM: Yeah?

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:31.005
LAURA: Have you-- I mean, I think you have because
you said you were, like, into somebody before. Have

00:21:31.005 --> 00:21:32.850
you ever kissed a boy?

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:34.199
SAM: Hmm.

00:21:34.199 --> 00:21:36.104
MARISHA: That was the cutest.

00:21:36.104 --> 00:21:37.606
LIAM: It's pretty cute.

00:21:37.606 --> 00:21:39.053
SAM: I've kissed a boy.

00:21:39.053 --> 00:21:40.983
LAURA: Yeah? What was it like?

00:21:40.983 --> 00:21:42.188
SAM: Excuse me?

00:21:42.188 --> 00:21:44.998
LAURA: What was it like when you kissed him?

00:21:44.998 --> 00:21:47.715
SAM: Have you never kissed someone?

00:21:47.715 --> 00:21:49.109
LAURA: No, well--

00:21:49.109 --> 00:21:53.392
SAM: You're related-- your mom is a master of
sexuality--

00:21:53.392 --> 00:21:57.335
LAURA: I was asking what it was like when <i>you</i>
kissed someone. That's all!

00:21:57.335 --> 00:21:58.974
SAM: Because you haven't done it.

00:21:58.974 --> 00:22:02.429
LAURA: Well, I didn't know if it counted.

00:22:02.429 --> 00:22:05.655
SAM: Oh. Well, what was the situation?

00:22:05.655 --> 00:22:07.760
LAURA: I was drowning.

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:13.951
SAM: Oh, you mean today? Oh!

00:22:13.951 --> 00:22:15.810
LAURA: Does that count, though?

00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:24.335
SAM: Okay. Well, I mean, let's take a look at
this. Your lips pressed against each others'.

00:22:24.335 --> 00:22:25.394
LAURA: Yes.

00:22:25.394 --> 00:22:27.479
SAM: It meant something.

00:22:27.479 --> 00:22:28.548
LAURA: Yeah.

00:22:28.548 --> 00:22:31.479
SAM: How did it make you feel?

00:22:31.479 --> 00:22:33.742
LAURA: Like I wasn't dead.

00:22:33.742 --> 00:22:40.964
SAM: Yeah. Alive. That is the feeling. Did it make
your heart beat faster than, you know, being

00:22:40.964 --> 00:22:42.574
completely stopped how it was.

00:22:42.574 --> 00:22:46.636
LAURA: Yeah, I think so. I mean, it's not dead.

00:22:46.636 --> 00:22:54.243
SAM: If I had to do my first kiss over again, I
would want all of those things.

00:22:54.243 --> 00:22:55.463
LAURA: Really?

00:22:55.463 --> 00:22:58.877
SAM: Yes! That's the best first kiss. It's someone
you care about--

00:22:58.877 --> 00:23:00.428
LAURA: Well, I didn't know if it counted.

00:23:00.428 --> 00:23:04.959
SAM: It means something. You'll remember it
forever.

00:23:04.959 --> 00:23:11.240
LAURA: I will. I will remember the after part of
it, you know?

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.496
SAM: Oh yes.

00:23:12.496 --> 00:23:15.199
LAURA: I was a little struggling in the beginning
part.

00:23:15.199 --> 00:23:20.589
SAM: Well, yes. Afterwards, I don't know if you
felt this way, you just can't stop thinking about

00:23:20.589 --> 00:23:33.852
it and you just feel the soft pressing against you
and almost taste him just for a little bit and it

00:23:33.852 --> 00:23:35.439
doesn't go away for a while.

00:23:35.439 --> 00:23:38.968
LAURA: I think his tusks are growing back.

00:23:38.968 --> 00:23:40.105
SAM: You felt a little--

00:23:40.105 --> 00:23:41.656
LAURA: Just a little bit of tusk!

00:23:41.656 --> 00:23:42.745
SAM: Ooh!

00:23:42.745 --> 00:23:45.526
LAURA: Yeah! What was your first kiss like,
though?

00:23:45.526 --> 00:23:49.873
SAM: It wasn't as romantic. It was just a dare.

00:23:49.873 --> 00:23:50.897
LAURA: Oh, really?

00:23:50.897 --> 00:23:51.947
SAM: Yes.

00:23:51.947 --> 00:23:53.495
LAURA: With who?

00:23:53.495 --> 00:24:04.474
SAM: I don't know. Just someone. I don't even
remember too much.

00:24:04.474 --> 00:24:07.918
LAURA: That's weird. You said you never forget
it.

00:24:11.608 --> 00:24:27.619
SAM: I sure did. It was just-- you know? I was
pretty young and kids just saying like, "Oh, you

00:24:27.865 --> 00:24:32.223
"kiss each other and you kiss each other now." Just
one of those types of games.

00:24:32.223 --> 00:24:34.375
LAURA: I think kids do that sort of stuff a lot.

00:24:34.375 --> 00:24:40.016
SAM: I think so too, but I don't remember his
name.

00:24:40.016 --> 00:24:46.621
LAURA: Oh. Do you remember the softness of his
lips?

00:24:46.621 --> 00:24:54.613
SAM: I do. Yes. It was a good day.

00:24:54.613 --> 00:24:59.130
LAURA: Yeah, today's pretty cool too.

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:06.024
SAM: Well, do you think things will change now
between you?

00:25:06.024 --> 00:25:10.149
LAURA: Oh, no. I mean, he might have a big crush
on me now, you know?

00:25:10.149 --> 00:25:11.625
SAM: Are you interested?

00:25:11.625 --> 00:25:14.226
LAURA: Oh, I don't know, you know?

00:25:14.226 --> 00:25:22.912
SAM: Well. Sometimes, boys like-- Why am I telling
you all this? Your mom's a lady of the night!

00:25:22.912 --> 00:25:24.384
LAURA: Yeah, I know!

00:25:24.384 --> 00:25:30.760
SAM: Sometimes boys like it if you are a little
bit aloof. A little bit cold to them afterwards

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:34.878
like maybe they did something wrong and they don't
even know what it was.

00:25:34.878 --> 00:25:35.655
LAURA: Really?

00:25:35.655 --> 00:25:36.429
SAM: Yes!

00:25:36.429 --> 00:25:38.054
LAURA: Like, the play the games?

00:25:38.054 --> 00:25:45.301
SAM: Yes! Just a little bit of like-- just keep
them guessing like "Did I say something? Did I do

00:25:45.301 --> 00:25:47.736
"something? Was I a bad kisser?"

00:25:47.736 --> 00:25:48.857
LAURA: Okay.

00:25:48.857 --> 00:25:51.041
SAM: That would put him on the defensive where you
want him.

00:25:51.041 --> 00:25:52.063
LAURA: That's right!

00:25:52.063 --> 00:25:57.603
SAM: Then you cut his throat and fucking kill him!
I'm just kidding about all that. I don't know.

00:25:57.613 --> 00:26:01.077
LAURA: Okay. Because I don't want to do that--

00:26:01.369 --> 00:26:03.094
SAM: No! Of course not! He's our friend.

00:26:03.094 --> 00:26:10.857
LAURA: Okay. Well, all right! Have fun with your
flask, okay?

00:26:10.857 --> 00:26:12.411
SAM: All right, I will.

00:26:12.411 --> 00:26:14.483
LAURA: I'm going to go write in my journal.

00:26:14.483 --> 00:26:16.453
SAM: Have fun drawing.

00:26:16.453 --> 00:26:17.489
LAURA: Okay.

00:26:17.489 --> 00:26:26.774
MATT: As everyone concludes their evening
activities, the journey, looking at the map and

00:26:26.774 --> 00:26:31.327
the distance, is about 800 miles to Darktow from
Urukayxl.

00:26:35.458 --> 00:26:37.968
TALIESIN: (intones theme from Pirates of the
Caribbean)

00:26:37.968 --> 00:26:41.632
MATT: Yeah, essentially. The ship normally--

00:26:41.632 --> 00:26:43.555
LIAM: Jesus Christ!

00:26:43.555 --> 00:26:48.226
SAM: We should solve this at some point, right? We
should get some bean bags or something?

00:26:48.226 --> 00:26:54.490
LAURA: We should probably just rotate it. Maybe if
you would roll it the other direction, it

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:56.327
straightens it out. Did you know that?

00:26:56.327 --> 00:26:59.318
MARISHA: Put in under my-- okay.

00:26:59.318 --> 00:27:03.285
MATT: Now it's not centered. Whatever. It's fine.
You guys deal with your map. It's not mine. It's

00:27:03.285 --> 00:27:14.620
your map. Do what you want. Not my responsibility!
Your ship is actually traveling faster than it

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:20.200
normally was as part of the blessing that Avantika
received. It can achieve about 55 miles--

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.829
SAM: An hour?!

00:27:21.829 --> 00:27:32.495
MATT: No. An entire day of travel which is a bit
faster than a general sailing ship which is why

00:27:32.495 --> 00:27:39.590
the Mistake can go faster, but they're a pair.
You're looking at about 14 days of travel.

00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:41.412
MARISHA: To Darktow?

00:27:41.412 --> 00:27:43.080
MATT: To Darktow, yeah.

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:44.979
MARISHA: 14 days?!

00:27:44.979 --> 00:27:47.027
MATT: Welcome to being on the open seas, man.

00:27:47.027 --> 00:27:48.616
MARISHA: Oh shit!

00:27:48.616 --> 00:27:54.151
MATT: They don't have bullet trains in D&D. You
have 11 days of supplies. There will have to be

00:27:54.151 --> 00:27:56.642
some sort of supply stop or a way of handling
that.

00:27:56.642 --> 00:27:59.780
TALIESIN: I have a thing called Create Food and
Water.

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:01.378
LAURA: I do too.

00:28:01.378 --> 00:28:04.350
TALIESIN: We can mix it up with the normal food so
it doesn't taste as bad.

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:09.184
MATT: That is going to make this journey not an
issue when it comes to supplies. Look at that.

00:28:09.184 --> 00:28:11.024
(singsong) Divine magic.

00:28:11.024 --> 00:28:12.448
TALIESIN: Teamwork!

00:28:12.448 --> 00:28:14.426
MATT: You don't have to stop then. All right,
great!

00:28:14.426 --> 00:28:18.683
TALIESIN: So sorry. We just burned an entire
encounter like, "Yeah! Fuck whatever Matthew made."

00:28:19.022 --> 00:28:25.647
SAM: Is food and water the only thing we need? Do
we need any other supplies to make this trip? I

00:28:25.647 --> 00:28:26.238
don't know.

00:28:26.238 --> 00:28:30.552
MATT: Not to get to Darktow. At Darktow, there
will be repairs made to the other ship and

00:28:30.552 --> 00:28:34.942
possibly some small repairs to the ship for its
journey and any other supplies you would need

00:28:34.942 --> 00:28:42.398
while there. It's a 14 day journey at full speed.
During this time, a couple of things. One, you

00:28:42.398 --> 00:28:48.386
guys can decide to, if you want to, learn how to
run a boat.

00:28:48.386 --> 00:28:49.692
MARISHA: I would like that very much.

00:28:49.692 --> 00:28:54.653
MATT: That being the case, we get to decide what
types of skill sets you want to pick up on out

00:28:54.653 --> 00:29:05.255
here in the ocean. That being the case, we have
the quartermaster. Quartermaster is the one who

00:29:05.255 --> 00:29:09.219
has the most authority other than the captain of
the ship. They take over if the captain is unable

00:29:09.219 --> 00:29:15.440
to. They divvy up plunder or whenever you board a
prized vessel, they decide what to take and what

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:21.164
to leave. They generally helm that whole process
there, as far as pirate ships are concerned. There

00:29:21.164 --> 00:29:22.661
is the navigator or the sailing master.

00:29:22.661 --> 00:29:23.494
LIAM: Dibs.

00:29:23.494 --> 00:29:27.690
MATT: You do have Orly hired to do that for you,
but Orly can also train one of you to be a backup

00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:28.847
in case Orly--

00:29:28.847 --> 00:29:33.568
TALIESIN: I was about to say anything like being
able to go by the stars or otherwise is something

00:29:33.568 --> 00:29:35.367
I might be able to do very well.

00:29:35.367 --> 00:29:37.323
MATT: You can both train under him if you want to.
You can overlap.

00:29:37.323 --> 00:29:38.950
LAURA: You do have memory--

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:44.033
LIAM: I know which direction is north at all
times. I don't forget anything. I'm real smart

00:29:44.033 --> 00:29:44.895
in-game.

00:29:44.895 --> 00:29:45.670
TALIESIN: Fair.

00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:48.467
LIAM: Just in the game.

00:29:48.467 --> 00:29:51.146
TALIESIN: Just lording that rap battle over me.
Okay, that's fine.

00:29:51.146 --> 00:29:55.818
MATT: We have the boatswain. Boatswain is in
charge of the ship itself. You know, keeping it in

00:29:56.043 --> 00:30:02.006
top shape for travel and battle. They handle
looking over the wood, the canvas, the ropes,

00:30:02.006 --> 00:30:07.101
making sure that everything's solid and
functional. They lead shore parties for supplies

00:30:07.101 --> 00:30:12.876
and repairs and oversee activities like dropping
and weighing the anchor, setting the sails,

00:30:12.876 --> 00:30:18.636
cleaning the deck, things like that. Start
thinking of things you might be interested in.

00:30:18.636 --> 00:30:24.287
There's the cooper, which makes and maintains
barrels for storage, food and water. There's the

00:30:24.287 --> 00:30:27.619
carpenter, which is the one that actually repairs
the ship's structural integrity when it takes

00:30:27.619 --> 00:30:33.144
damage. They answer to the boatswain. They keep
the hull, the masts, and the yardarms functional.

00:30:33.144 --> 00:30:40.223
There's the master gunner who organizes the
placement of shot, powder, the fuse and aiming the

00:30:40.223 --> 00:30:49.466
ship's cannons. All right, so, Nott's going to
want to train as the master gunner. And, of

00:30:49.466 --> 00:30:52.760
course, powder monkey, which is the next one below
who basically runs all the stuff.

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:53.800
SAM: Powder monkey?

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:55.114
MATT: Powder monkey.

00:30:55.114 --> 00:30:56.996
SAM: Maybe I'll apprentice as that first?

00:30:56.996 --> 00:31:02.352
MATT: Apprentice as powder monkey and, should it
be needed, you'll become, hopefully, a good master

00:31:02.352 --> 00:31:07.346
gunner. Those are the most important aspects.
Everyone'll learn a little bit about sailing as

00:31:07.346 --> 00:31:11.068
you go, but start getting an idea, if you want to
right now, which one of those you'd want to

00:31:11.068 --> 00:31:13.088
specifically begin to focus on.

00:31:13.088 --> 00:31:16.078
LAURA: What does the boatswain do again?

00:31:16.078 --> 00:31:20.813
SAM: Manager of the ship. Like the office manager,
right? Keeps it running?

00:31:20.813 --> 00:31:26.821
MATT: Yeah, makes sure that all the canvas, the
ropes, the wood, everything's in good condition.

00:31:26.821 --> 00:31:30.773
TRAVIS: I have experience being a quartermaster,
so I'll do that as well.

00:31:30.773 --> 00:31:31.994
LAURA: Oh, okay.

00:31:31.994 --> 00:31:36.199
SAM: He said quartermaster, not boatswain.

00:31:36.199 --> 00:31:41.169
LAURA: I guess I'll do the boatswain stuff? I feel
like I'll be really bad at it.

00:31:42.686 --> 00:31:48.621
MATT: We'll find out. Train as the boatswain.
Which, actually, to that point, the next morning,

00:31:48.621 --> 00:31:55.743
as everyone begins to go about the first real day
out here in the Lucidian Ocean, clear blue sky

00:31:55.743 --> 00:32:03.456
with dappled bits of cloud around you, the smell
of sea salt and foam and spray making its way as

00:32:03.456 --> 00:32:11.156
it splashes across the front of the bow, Avantika
catches up to you with Vera being called up to the

00:32:11.156 --> 00:32:20.574
side. She goes, "Vera, if you'd be so kind, I
would like to call-- let's say the utmost members

00:32:20.574 --> 00:32:24.975
"of the crew, please, to the deck. Maybe some of
your friends as well."

00:32:24.975 --> 00:32:27.060
TRAVIS: Of course, I'll bring them up.

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:33.183
MATT: As you all gather on the deck, Avantika
goes, "I appreciate all of the hard work you've

00:32:33.183 --> 00:32:40.455
"put into this, my crew and yours. As we are making
our way back it is important that we properly

00:32:40.455 --> 00:32:46.875
"balance as we endeavor here and make sure that
both training that has been inquired about is

00:32:46.875 --> 00:32:55.447
"properly disseminated, and, out of curiosity, and
with no disrespect to you Vera, I will be

00:32:55.447 --> 00:33:02.058
"replacing you as the ship's quartermaster until we
return to Darktow with our Captain Tusktooth."

00:33:02.058 --> 00:33:18.291
Vera looks taken aback and briefly offended, and
then, "But of course, my captain." "Quartermaster,

00:33:18.291 --> 00:33:20.659
"time to start paying attention."

00:33:20.659 --> 00:33:22.203
TRAVIS: Indeed.

00:33:22.203 --> 00:33:25.656
MATT: She begins to divvy out responsibilities to
the rest of you in the various positions that you

00:33:25.656 --> 00:33:32.128
requested to start learning. Some elements of the
journey have you moving over to the Mistake, some

00:33:32.128 --> 00:33:35.778
have you moving back, especially for the repairs
elements, whoever decides they want to be the

00:33:35.778 --> 00:33:39.345
carpenter. Unless none of you want to. That's up
to you.

00:33:39.345 --> 00:33:40.352
SAM: You're strong.

00:33:40.352 --> 00:33:42.246
LAURA: I'm strong, maybe I should be the
carpenter!

00:33:42.246 --> 00:33:43.794
SAM: Do you have any--

00:33:43.794 --> 00:33:44.784
LAURA: I've got no.

00:33:44.784 --> 00:33:46.723
SAM and LAURA: Nothing.

00:33:46.723 --> 00:33:48.007
MATT: It's up to you.

00:33:48.007 --> 00:33:50.279
MARISHA: What was that cooper position? Barrels?

00:33:50.279 --> 00:33:52.165
MATT: Makes and maintains barrels.

00:33:52.165 --> 00:33:53.969
SAM: Hey, you've been around barrels your whole
life!

00:33:53.969 --> 00:33:56.012
MARISHA: I already know how to make a barrel.

00:33:56.012 --> 00:33:57.800
LAURA: Do you want to be the boatswain?

00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:00.207
TALIESIN: I was thinking the one where you
actually have to go out and find supplies. I might

00:34:00.207 --> 00:34:01.372
be really good at that.

00:34:01.372 --> 00:34:02.353
MATT: That is the boatswain.

00:34:02.353 --> 00:34:03.919
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'll take the boatswain.

00:34:03.919 --> 00:34:05.101
LAURA: Okay, then I'll do the carpenter.

00:34:05.101 --> 00:34:07.586
MATT: There we go. Note that somewhere on your
character that those are the positions you're

00:34:07.586 --> 00:34:10.001
training on this journey. All right, cooper, got
it.

00:34:10.001 --> 00:34:12.071
MARISHA: Making barrels.

00:34:12.071 --> 00:34:14.098
SAM: I'm the gunner! Well, the powder monkey.

00:34:14.098 --> 00:34:16.022
MATT: Powder monkey for now.

00:34:16.022 --> 00:34:17.888
SAM: For now. Working my way up.

00:34:17.888 --> 00:34:29.710
MATT: A few days into this journey, we'll say
because you're training as the carpenter--

00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:31.292
LAURA: Yes!

00:34:31.292 --> 00:34:42.110
MATT: Jester, the Mistake is keeping in time with
the Squalleater and you're brought-- it slows down

00:34:42.343 --> 00:34:45.941
a bit and you're brought over to the opposite side
and there, looking around, you wander under the

00:34:45.941 --> 00:34:55.164
deck and find, at one of the tables, Waldok, who's
one of the deckhands of the ship. He's currently

00:34:55.164 --> 00:35:03.600
sitting at a table with a large tankard of really
rough grog or ale, biting his lower lip, and he

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:09.944
has his sleeve pulled up and you can see Orly has
this unique bowstring of some kind that's wrapped

00:35:09.944 --> 00:35:15.466
between two fingers, an inkwell, and a needle
that's tied up in it, and he's currently halfway

00:35:15.466 --> 00:35:22.026
through doing this really good-looking, elaborate
tattoo across the arm of this deckhand.

00:35:22.026 --> 00:35:23.641
LAURA: Whoa!

00:35:23.641 --> 00:35:27.001
MATT: He's got his patch over his eye, right up
against one of the portholes where the light's

00:35:27.001 --> 00:35:34.048
coming through and he's using it for perspective,
and he's lording over this smaller, thin human,

00:35:34.048 --> 00:35:38.058
and glances over, "Oh, hey there."

00:35:38.058 --> 00:35:41.335
LAURA: Can I go stand over his shoulder and stare
at what he's doing?

00:35:41.335 --> 00:35:50.422
MATT: Yeah, you keep watch and he's doing this
curled mermaid that is coming up and, on one hand

00:35:50.422 --> 00:35:56.794
is holding on at the hip and the other is picking
a fruit off of a tree. You begin to question the

00:35:56.794 --> 00:36:01.650
design a bit and Orly says, offhand, "It's what he
requested."

00:36:01.650 --> 00:36:05.553
LAURA: Why are you having a mermaid pick fruit if
she's in the water?

00:36:05.553 --> 00:36:13.640
MATT: He's sitting there going like, "(grunting)
Well, I had a rough fight with some scurvy a few

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:22.928
"years back and a few things I like the idea of
ladies in the sea that can save me from scurvy."

00:36:22.928 --> 00:36:27.276
LAURA: Oh, that's really smart. It's very
meaningful.

00:36:27.276 --> 00:36:32.984
MATT: Orly chuckles under his breath. It's very
well done, and you can see now the other tattoos

00:36:32.984 --> 00:36:36.714
that are across his body were probably done by him
on himself.

00:36:36.714 --> 00:36:41.089
LAURA: Hey, Orly, I'm training to be a carpenter,
did you know?

00:36:41.089 --> 00:36:52.215
MATT: "I wasn't aware, actually, but m-m-maybe you
should ask around for the man who's doing the

00:36:52.215 --> 00:36:54.276
"repairs around this place."

00:36:54.276 --> 00:36:59.980
LAURA: Yeah, I will definitely do that, but I also
want to learn how to do tattoos. Can you teach me that?

00:37:01.335 --> 00:37:04.444
MATT: "I can try and teach you some of--"

00:37:04.444 --> 00:37:06.427
LAURA: I'm a really good artist, Orly.

00:37:06.427 --> 00:37:17.060
MATT: "-- m-m-my skills. However, I got a specific
talent with some of this here."

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:23.182
LAURA: Yeah, it's a thing that you wrap around
your fingers and then you go like this?

00:37:23.182 --> 00:37:29.770
MATT: "Kind of. Here, do you m-m-mind?" The guy's
like, "Uh."

00:37:29.770 --> 00:37:33.186
LAURA: I'm a really good artist, don't worry.

00:37:33.186 --> 00:37:43.533
MATT: "Sure?" Orly helps show you how he threads
this and gets the needle set up. Go ahead and make

00:37:43.533 --> 00:37:44.930
a performance check.

00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:45.869
TRAVIS: Oh god.

00:37:45.869 --> 00:37:47.028
LIAM: Oh jeez.

00:37:47.028 --> 00:37:48.584
MARISHA: Performance?

00:37:48.584 --> 00:37:51.005
LAURA: Performance. Oh no, performance!

00:37:51.005 --> 00:37:52.918
MATT: We'll say dexterity, if you really want to.

00:37:52.918 --> 00:37:56.797
LAURA: Yeah, I'll do dexterity. Oh, 17!

00:37:56.797 --> 00:38:02.907
MATT: 17. Picking up where the initial partial ink
sketches were, you actually continue to fill in

00:38:02.907 --> 00:38:09.332
the rest of the upper torso. You do a very good
job. You can see where the style does shift in the

00:38:09.332 --> 00:38:13.982
art, but it's not abrasive, it just continues, and
it is rather nice.

00:38:13.982 --> 00:38:17.327
LAURA: Do you think maybe your mermaid would want
some googly eyes?

00:38:17.327 --> 00:38:21.820
MATT: He goes, "Um, no. I appreciate that, but
no."

00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:24.360
LAURA: Are you sure? I think it'd really make her
look really good.

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:28.769
MATT: He starts to pull his arm away from you.
Orly puts his giant tortle hand on your shoulder

00:38:28.769 --> 00:38:34.936
and goes, "I don't recommend m-m-messing with the
artistic vision."

00:38:34.936 --> 00:38:39.320
LAURA: I understand. I don't want people messing
with my artistic vision, either.

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:41.221
MATT: "There you are."

00:38:41.221 --> 00:38:45.176
LAURA: You and me, Orly. We're going to be fast
friends.

00:38:45.176 --> 00:38:52.049
MATT: "I like the idea of that. Point of order--"

00:38:52.049 --> 00:38:54.227
LAURA: Did you say "porn of order?"

00:38:54.227 --> 00:38:55.696
MATT: "Point of order."

00:38:55.696 --> 00:38:56.608
LAURA: Okay.

00:38:56.608 --> 00:39:06.612
MATT: "You don't happen to have any sort of gem
dust, do you?"

00:39:06.612 --> 00:39:11.328
LAURA: Gem dust. Like a gem that's been powdered?

00:39:11.328 --> 00:39:12.189
MATT: "Yeah."

00:39:12.189 --> 00:39:13.960
LAURA: Or like ink?

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:18.613
MATT: "Oh, I have plenty of ink. It's m-m-more--"

00:39:19.015 --> 00:39:21.187
LAURA: Wait, are you trying to make a sparkly
ink?

00:39:21.187 --> 00:39:24.815
MATT: "M-m-more or less."

00:39:24.815 --> 00:39:32.458
LAURA: I mean, I don't have any powdered gems, but
I could probably powder some gems.

00:39:32.458 --> 00:39:46.945
MATT: "I picked up this technique years ago from
some of the individuals that spawned from the

00:39:46.945 --> 00:40:00.557
"legacy of the island folk. It allows me to instill
a m-m-mighty ink spot." As he does that, he flexes

00:40:00.557 --> 00:40:06.560
his arm and the tattoo shimmies every so slightly
and his muscles bulge a bit.

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:14.801
LAURA: Oh my god. Will you teach me how to do that
if I give you some dust?

00:40:14.801 --> 00:40:24.994
MATT: "See, it's not so much something that can be
easily taught; more that it's something bequeathed

00:40:24.994 --> 00:40:27.183
"by an elder."

00:40:27.183 --> 00:40:29.707
LAURA: Do you want to bequeath me?

00:40:29.707 --> 00:40:30.458
MATT: "No."

00:40:30.458 --> 00:40:33.406
LAURA: What if you really like me, though?

00:40:33.406 --> 00:40:44.291
MATT: "We'll see how time goes by. For the time
being, just let me know if I can be of service."

00:40:44.291 --> 00:40:52.078
He talks to you about it and he gives you an
overview of his capabilities. For different types

00:40:52.078 --> 00:41:00.895
of gem dust, he can imbue somebody with a series
of tattoos that can alter elements of their

00:41:00.895 --> 00:41:07.796
physical self. It's not inexpensive, and each
person can only have it once ever, so it's not

00:41:07.796 --> 00:41:14.570
like you can have multiple. For 2,200 gold worth
of a ruby dust he can imbue a permanent +1 to strength.

00:41:14.718 --> 00:41:15.987
TRAVIS: What?

00:41:15.987 --> 00:41:18.747
(exclamations)

00:41:18.747 --> 00:41:22.696
MATT: For 2,200 gold worth of emerald dust he can
do a permanent +1 to dex. He runs down the stat

00:41:22.696 --> 00:41:29.203
sheet there. The most expensive one's
constitution; that's 2,500 worth of diamond dust.

00:41:29.203 --> 00:41:35.090
There are all the different gem types there. He
can also imbue certain resistances. Those are more

00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:41.211
expensive, those are 5,000 gold worth of fire opal
dust for fire resist and 5,000 gold worth of black

00:41:41.211 --> 00:41:46.952
sapphire dust for cold resist. He has the
capability of imbuing essentially magical,

00:41:46.952 --> 00:41:49.801
permanent tattoos.

00:41:49.801 --> 00:41:51.732
LAURA: That is amazing.

00:41:51.732 --> 00:41:55.172
MARISHA: I have a jeweler's kit. (pigeon cooing)

00:41:55.172 --> 00:41:56.374
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

00:41:56.374 --> 00:41:58.189
MARISHA: Beau made jewelry. (pigeon cooing)

00:41:58.189 --> 00:41:59.579
TRAVIS: That's a shit-load of jewels.

00:41:59.579 --> 00:42:00.592
MATT: Yeah, that's something.

00:42:00.592 --> 00:42:02.319
LAURA: That's a lot of jewels.

00:42:02.319 --> 00:42:03.367
SAM: We have some, though.

00:42:03.367 --> 00:42:04.757
LAURA: Yeah, we have some.

00:42:04.757 --> 00:42:06.352
TALIESIN: Some stuff that we don't want to get rid
of.

00:42:06.352 --> 00:42:07.023
LAURA: Yeah.

00:42:07.023 --> 00:42:08.819
MARISHA: I want some magic tattoos!

00:42:08.819 --> 00:42:12.997
LAURA: Oh my gosh, do they shimmer, though, do
look sparkly on your body, do they look shiny?

00:42:12.997 --> 00:42:18.079
MATT: You can see aspects of, based on what
enchantment it is-- like on Orly, his is

00:42:18.079 --> 00:42:25.343
specifically an aquamarine dust. It has this
faint, aquamarine, light blue shimmy to it; as

00:42:25.343 --> 00:42:27.428
soon as the light hits it, it glitters across.

00:42:27.428 --> 00:42:29.209
LAURA: (gasping)

00:42:29.209 --> 00:42:30.633
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck.

00:42:30.633 --> 00:42:33.052
MATT: Aquamarine dust being the one that boosts
charisma.

00:42:33.052 --> 00:42:37.334
LAURA: Orly, you're so charismatic.

00:42:37.334 --> 00:42:43.453
MATT: "(laughs) M-m-many folk have said that."

00:42:44.833 --> 00:42:51.180
LAURA: I would definitely want to learn this from
you, and I probably, once I get a little more rich

00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:55.262
and I have some powdered gems, I'm going to have
you do it to me.

00:42:55.262 --> 00:43:01.080
MATT: "Well, looks like you're just going to have
to keep me employed for quite a while."

00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:02.840
LAURA: Yeah, don't get hurt, okay?

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:08.599
MATT: "Don't get me hurt." He goes back to
finishing up the tattoo on the individual.

00:43:08.599 --> 00:43:11.614
LAURA: Okay, what was the guy's name that was
getting a tattoo?

00:43:11.614 --> 00:43:13.050
MATT: That was Waldok.

00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:17.229
LAURA: Waldok. Well, Waldok, I'll see you later.

00:43:17.229 --> 00:43:19.499
MATT: "(grunts) Okay."

00:43:19.499 --> 00:43:23.087
LAURA: I'm going to go carpenter some stuff.

00:43:23.087 --> 00:43:24.141
MATT: All right.

00:43:24.141 --> 00:43:25.729
MARISHA: Holy shit.

00:43:25.729 --> 00:43:37.851
MATT: Roughly eight days into this journey, you've
moved about 100 miles off the shore of the

00:43:38.131 --> 00:43:49.599
southern island of Bwuali when a small horn sound
goes off on the Squalleater. (horn call) It's a

00:43:49.599 --> 00:43:51.416
small horn. It's a very small horn.

00:43:51.416 --> 00:43:52.665
LAURA: I had a flashback.

00:43:52.944 --> 00:43:56.410
MATT: I know. This wasn't meant to be an epic horn
that I totally failed on. This is intentionally a

00:43:56.410 --> 00:44:05.548
small horn. Glancing at the top, you can see
Avantika has climbed to the center of the mainmast

00:44:05.548 --> 00:44:12.437
and towards one of the crow's nests up top, and,
looking down, points to you, Fjord, and goes,

00:44:12.437 --> 00:44:17.314
"Quartermaster, call two of your compatriots that
you trust to the top with me."

00:44:17.314 --> 00:44:26.026
TRAVIS: Will do! Jester, Deuce.

00:44:26.026 --> 00:44:26.976
TALIESIN: Yeah?

00:44:26.976 --> 00:44:28.287
TRAVIS: Up top.

00:44:28.287 --> 00:44:30.405
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, I like it up there.

00:44:30.405 --> 00:44:37.844
MATT: You guys climb up the mainmast to the crow's
nest, and there you see Avantika with a spyglass,

00:44:37.844 --> 00:44:45.064
and she leans in to the three of you, directing
mainly towards Fjord, and goes, "Now that we are

00:44:45.064 --> 00:44:51.198
at sea, I want to show you something." She pulls
out the spyglass and holds it over to you and

00:44:51.198 --> 00:45:01.519
helps you point it in the direction. Here you see
a vessel, a little ways off on the horizon. A

00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:09.974
little bit north of where you are, a northwestward
direction. She whispers over your shoulder so the

00:45:09.974 --> 00:45:18.903
rest of you can hear. "Glancing at this ship ahead
of us, it appears to be a Concord ship. A shipping

00:45:18.903 --> 00:45:25.580
vessel probably carrying trade goods. It appears
to be equipped for rapid travel, but we could head

00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:33.054
it off. As my quartermaster, I ask you for your
opinion. What should we do?"

00:45:33.054 --> 00:45:45.662
TRAVIS: Well, I'm sure it's a ship of innocents.
We don't want to stray from our path, correct?

00:45:45.662 --> 00:45:48.563
MATT: "Take a look. What do you see?"

00:45:48.563 --> 00:45:51.374
TRAVIS: I'll use the spyglass.

00:45:51.374 --> 00:45:53.026
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:45:53.026 --> 00:45:57.045
SAM: They're torturing orphans on the deck.

00:45:57.045 --> 00:45:58.270
TRAVIS: 20.

00:45:58.270 --> 00:46:07.336
MATT: Okay. Glancing at it, it's a pretty well
made ship. It's meant for speed. It doesn't appear

00:46:07.336 --> 00:46:14.275
to be heavily manned. It's not carrying or
transporting people. It doesn't seem to be a

00:46:14.275 --> 00:46:22.314
transport ship of any means. You see a handful of
small sailors on board with a hand crossbow or a

00:46:22.314 --> 00:46:30.257
saber that's sheathed at the side. You see on the
deck a handful of crates that were not kept

00:46:30.257 --> 00:46:37.611
beneath, which means it's probably pretty
well-packed. It does appear to be Concord colors.

00:46:37.611 --> 00:46:43.234
Since it's traveling southward, you gather it's
probably recently finished-- especially with your

00:46:43.234 --> 00:46:48.396
experience as a sailor-- finished stocking up on
all its materials, travel supplies and its goods.

00:46:48.396 --> 00:46:53.435
Based on the path it's heading southward, it's
either going to arc around to Tal'Dorei or be

00:46:53.435 --> 00:46:57.995
heading in the direction of Marquet or possibly,
if it's feeling risky, the Shattered Teeth.

00:46:57.995 --> 00:47:05.196
TRAVIS: Captain, are you in a habit of
intercepting said vessels in your time at sea?

00:47:06.085 --> 00:47:14.881
MATT: "Depends if we can do so quickly without
losing any sort of momentum, perhaps? Not all

00:47:14.881 --> 00:47:22.398
"ships are boarded and there is a loss of life.
Most, I'd say probably 80 percent of encounters

00:47:22.398 --> 00:47:26.929
"out here, is just intimidation. Most let us take
what we want and continue on our way. They don't

00:47:26.929 --> 00:47:28.737
"want to die."

00:47:28.737 --> 00:47:34.947
TRAVIS: It's important that you know in my
previous life I had encounters with pirating

00:47:34.947 --> 00:47:40.551
vessels as well and most of those experiences I
did not enjoy.

00:47:40.551 --> 00:47:46.059
MATT: "Well, to be fair, there are plenty of
assholes on these waters, so it does not surprise

00:47:46.059 --> 00:47:53.905
"me. But it is your choice, I say. You may talk
amongst your friends, but there is opportunity."

00:47:53.905 --> 00:47:58.555
TRAVIS: You say no need for a loss of life?

00:47:58.555 --> 00:48:03.425
MATT: "Not unless they-- how do you say-- they are
stupid?"

00:48:03.425 --> 00:48:05.043
TRAVIS: Or stubborn.

00:48:05.043 --> 00:48:07.124
MATT: "Either or."

00:48:07.124 --> 00:48:19.768
TRAVIS: Well, my fellow boatswain and navigators
to be? Nope? Boatswain and carpenter? Yeah.

00:48:20.138 --> 00:48:23.916
LAURA: I'm a carpenter, Fjord. I'm learning to be
a carpenter.

00:48:23.916 --> 00:48:25.402
TRAVIS: Okay, carpenter and--

00:48:25.402 --> 00:48:27.100
LAURA: And a really good tattoo artist.

00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:28.072
TRAVIS: What are you?

00:48:28.072 --> 00:48:29.521
TALIESIN: A boatswain.

00:48:29.521 --> 00:48:31.457
TRAVIS: Oh, well, I had that completely fucking
backwards.

00:48:31.457 --> 00:48:41.974
I take real good notes. What
say you on such a dangerous expedition as this?

00:48:41.974 --> 00:48:44.348
TALIESIN: May I?

00:48:44.616 --> 00:48:45.916
TRAVIS: Oh yes, of course.

00:48:45.916 --> 00:48:47.234
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a look at this thing.

00:48:47.234 --> 00:48:50.499
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:48:50.499 --> 00:48:53.995
TALIESIN: 22.

00:48:53.995 --> 00:48:59.885
MATT: Okay. You make out the same details as he
does. Nothing catches your attention. Nothing

00:48:59.885 --> 00:49:06.575
about it seems out of the ordinary per se, but it
does seem to be a vessel that is filled with its

00:49:06.575 --> 00:49:08.846
payload and making its way south.

00:49:08.846 --> 00:49:12.170
LAURA: Let me see!

00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:16.272
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:49:16.272 --> 00:49:22.396
LAURA: Only because I would totally do it if they
were both looking and I rolled like shit. I think

00:49:22.396 --> 00:49:24.599
there's a ship!

00:49:24.599 --> 00:49:26.589
TRAVIS: You're not wrong.

00:49:26.589 --> 00:49:35.063
TALIESIN: Obviously the decision is yours, but we
are low on supplies which means we have more to

00:49:35.063 --> 00:49:41.633
lose. If something goes wrong, we lose vital
members of our crew or burn through magic ability.

00:49:41.633 --> 00:49:46.557
We're going to be without food whereas I'm sure
they're probably very well stocked and prepared

00:49:46.557 --> 00:49:54.544
for these sorts of eventualities. I feel like we
would be coming in from a place of weakness.

00:49:54.544 --> 00:49:57.489
That's my initial thought.

00:49:57.489 --> 00:50:01.950
TRAVIS: Jester?

00:50:01.950 --> 00:50:07.186
LAURA: Oh man, I don't know. I'd be okay with it,
I guess.

00:50:07.186 --> 00:50:09.621
TRAVIS: You're up for a scrap on the seas?

00:50:09.621 --> 00:50:15.314
LAURA: Well, it doesn't have to be a scrap like
Avantika said. It could be, you know, go in and

00:50:15.314 --> 00:50:18.879
take stuff but maybe we could also give them
something!

00:50:18.879 --> 00:50:21.273
TRAVIS: What would we give them?

00:50:21.273 --> 00:50:24.950
LAURA: I don't know, like new names or pretty
drawings?

00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:26.284
TALIESIN: Fine art.

00:50:26.284 --> 00:50:29.608
LAURA: Yeah, we could just make it a fun time for
them.

00:50:29.608 --> 00:50:32.410
MATT: "An aggressive trade. Interesting."

00:50:32.410 --> 00:50:34.288
TRAVIS: Very well.

00:50:34.288 --> 00:50:36.840
MATT: "What is your decision?"

00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:44.356
TRAVIS: As long as we abstain as well as we can
from violence and as long as your men in the crew

00:50:44.570 --> 00:50:53.503
understand my disgust at such tactics, I think we
can make our way towards an intercept.

00:50:53.503 --> 00:50:59.617
MATT: You watch as this playful look on her face
as she watches this discourse turns into this

00:50:59.617 --> 00:51:11.207
extremely intense, Joker-like grin and she goes
"Well then, welcome to piracy my friends. Come."

00:51:11.207 --> 00:51:16.810
She jumps off the side and heads the ropes down
and begins shouting off commands to people on the ship.

00:51:16.810 --> 00:51:18.633
TALIESIN: I think that escalated rather quickly.

00:51:18.633 --> 00:51:23.256
LAURA: She made me question what we just did. I
thought it was one thing and then her face made me

00:51:23.256 --> 00:51:25.258
think it's a whole other thing.

00:51:25.258 --> 00:51:27.654
TRAVIS: Well, you said we need supplies right?

00:51:27.654 --> 00:51:31.377
TALIESIN: Well, I said that we were in a position
of disadvantage.

00:51:31.377 --> 00:51:36.608
TRAVIS: I felt like your words were different
before. Listen, we're going to not use violence

00:51:36.608 --> 00:51:38.036
all right? I'm not--

00:51:38.036 --> 00:51:40.624
MATT: The sails shift as the ropes are being
pulled--

00:51:40.624 --> 00:51:45.709
TRAVIS: Do me a favor. Spread the word amongst the
rest of us and make sure the rest of the crew

00:51:45.709 --> 00:51:50.743
hears as well. I don't want innocent blood shed if
it can be helped.

00:51:50.743 --> 00:51:54.540
LAURA: I mean, whatever, Fjord. I guess we can do
that if you want to. I don't care.

00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:58.019
TRAVIS: Thank you, Jester.

00:51:58.019 --> 00:52:01.463
LAURA: I'm already down. I'm not there anymore.

00:52:01.463 --> 00:52:03.633
MATT: All right.

00:52:03.633 --> 00:52:07.488
TALIESIN: I feel like this is somehow connected to
your previous bad decisions.

00:52:07.488 --> 00:52:09.436
MARISHA: Aw shit.

00:52:09.436 --> 00:52:15.437
TRAVIS: Nope. Is the big ogre--

00:52:15.437 --> 00:52:16.764
MATT: Bouldergut?

00:52:16.764 --> 00:52:18.341
TRAVIS: Yes, that name.

00:52:18.341 --> 00:52:24.230
MATT: Yes, Bouldergut is on this ship. She has
been moved from The Mistake partially because

00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:30.115
Bouldergut acts as a bodyguard to Avantika and
because the other ship itself is in serious need

00:52:30.115 --> 00:52:33.165
of repairs. They assume probably don't put the
giant heavy ogre on it.

00:52:33.165 --> 00:52:34.769
TRAVIS: Can I find Bouldergut?

00:52:34.769 --> 00:52:39.943
MATT: Sure enough. Bouldergut is down there
currently getting ready with a giant great club

00:52:39.943 --> 00:52:42.688
that is carved from an older masthead.

00:52:42.688 --> 00:52:44.227
TRAVIS: Bouldergut?

00:52:44.227 --> 00:52:46.643
MATT: "What?"

00:52:46.643 --> 00:52:49.302
TRAVIS: I'm sure that is just for show, yes?

00:52:49.302 --> 00:52:52.741
MATT: "Right. For show."

00:52:52.741 --> 00:52:57.174
TRAVIS: It's important you understand I have an
agreement with the captain. No unnecessary

00:52:57.174 --> 00:53:01.703
bloodshed. You will make sure that the rest of the
men know this.

00:53:01.703 --> 00:53:07.650
MATT: She looks back and Avantika goes, "Oh don't
worry. You are the quartermaster. You are the one

00:53:07.650 --> 00:53:13.878
"who is to be boarding any sort of ships that we
encounter so you choose your people."

00:53:13.878 --> 00:53:23.697
TRAVIS: (uncertain noises) I know. Making sure you
know. That is all.

00:53:23.697 --> 00:53:30.967
TALIESIN: In my imagination that felt vaguely like
a threat.

00:53:30.967 --> 00:53:37.697
MATT: At this point you watch as Ipess, who is the
second mate of the ship, this sunburned gnome

00:53:37.964 --> 00:53:46.894
begins scurrying up the rope to go ahead and put
their flag on display. Ipess. I-P-E-S-S.

00:53:46.894 --> 00:53:48.948
TALIESIN: What does the flag look like?

00:53:48.948 --> 00:53:56.366
MATT: The flag on this is a dull gray purple color
and it has a similar sketch of the same eye tattoo

00:53:56.366 --> 00:53:58.049
that Avantika has on her chest.

00:53:58.049 --> 00:54:00.517
TALIESIN: All right.

00:54:00.517 --> 00:54:05.738
MATT: As that goes up and the ship begins to move
to intercept, glancing through the eyeglass in the

00:54:05.738 --> 00:54:10.482
distance you can see the other ship noticing the
approach and there is now a bunch of chaos as they

00:54:10.482 --> 00:54:15.536
all begin running up and down the ship notifying
everybody else on there. What are you doing to

00:54:15.536 --> 00:54:16.326
prepare, guys?

00:54:16.326 --> 00:54:22.238
TRAVIS: I'm running to find Nott, our master
gunner-in-training. I'll say: Nott? I need you to

00:54:22.238 --> 00:54:24.324
keep an eye on those guns we're not looking--

00:54:24.324 --> 00:54:28.723
SAM: (shouting) All right you motherfuckers! I
need hollow charges loaded! I need extra fuses on

00:54:28.723 --> 00:54:36.802
every motherfucking cannon! Get me hollow shells
loaded with extra charges. I want four cannonballs

00:54:36.802 --> 00:54:39.624
on every cannon! Move!

00:54:39.624 --> 00:54:45.639
TRAVIS: Nott! Nott! Oh my god! Look. Again, we're not
looking to sink this ship, okay? We're going to

00:54:45.639 --> 00:54:51.786
try and board, get what we need and let them go. I
don't want unnecessary violence.

00:54:51.786 --> 00:54:56.173
MARISHA: I run in with a keg of black powder that
I've been building. (shouting) Are we fighting?!

00:54:56.173 --> 00:54:56.918
SAM: (shouting) Yeah!

00:54:56.918 --> 00:54:58.100
MARISHA: (shouting) Is this a fight?

00:54:58.100 --> 00:55:00.510
SAM: (shouting) Light them up! Load them up! Put
the charges at the ready!

00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:01.599
MARISHA: (shouting) Who's trying to punk our ass?

00:55:01.599 --> 00:55:02.746
SAM: (shouting) Short fuses!

00:55:02.746 --> 00:55:03.549
MARISHA: Okay!

00:55:03.549 --> 00:55:09.748
MATT: The angry, tough red-bearded dwarf that
actually acts as the cannon master of the ship

00:55:09.748 --> 00:55:16.348
that goes by the name of Ophiscan Duth. "I'm
interested in possibly getting involved, but this

00:55:16.348 --> 00:55:19.565
is too much fun to watch. Keep going, goblin, I'm
liking it."

00:55:19.565 --> 00:55:22.327
SAM: (shouting) If you're not going to help stand
out of my way!

00:55:22.327 --> 00:55:31.594
MARISHA: All right, I've got five pounders, eight
pounders, 12 pounders, short fuses and a 20 pound keg.

00:55:32.092 --> 00:55:35.496
MATT: Two of the other deckhands who act as powder
monkeys are also helping get things organized.

00:55:35.496 --> 00:55:37.235
MARISHA: What are we doing? What's going on?

00:55:37.235 --> 00:55:41.310
TRAVIS: We're doing great. Beau, you're going to
join me as we pull alongside the ship.

00:55:41.310 --> 00:55:41.985
MARISHA: Okay!

00:55:41.985 --> 00:55:44.137
TRAVIS: You're part of the boarding party. Go up
above.

00:55:44.137 --> 00:55:44.736
MARISHA: Okay.

00:55:44.736 --> 00:55:50.052
TRAVIS: Nott? I pull Nott close and I say: If you
fucking fire on that ship before they fire on us

00:55:50.052 --> 00:55:54.516
you will never get into the Academy. Do you
understand?

00:55:54.516 --> 00:55:56.768
SAM: The Academy?

00:55:56.768 --> 00:55:57.415
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:55:57.415 --> 00:55:58.713
MARISHA: So we're not fighting?

00:55:58.713 --> 00:56:00.927
TRAVIS: The letter that I have that grants me
access?

00:56:00.927 --> 00:56:01.543
SAM: Oh.

00:56:01.543 --> 00:56:03.061
TRAVIS: If you want that for Caleb--

00:56:03.061 --> 00:56:04.062
SAM: Oh, I see.

00:56:04.062 --> 00:56:10.490
TRAVIS: So act real tough and yell real loud.
Don't fire on them unless they fire on us, you understand?

00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:14.994
MATT: "Though I would recommend if you're going to
fire do a warning shot. Tends to get them a bit

00:56:14.994 --> 00:56:17.838
"spooked in their boots and slowing down."

00:56:17.838 --> 00:56:21.097
SAM: So a warning shot's okay?

00:56:21.097 --> 00:56:26.851
MATT: "Across the bow, not at the ship. In front
of it, away from it but just enough to show a

00:56:26.851 --> 00:56:28.178
"little bit of power."

00:56:28.178 --> 00:56:31.732
SAM: To me it seems like the closer the more
intimidating. Right?

00:56:31.732 --> 00:56:36.828
MATT: "There's a bit of a range of error with
these weapons. They're not a perfect art."

00:56:36.828 --> 00:56:40.695
SAM: So "don't fire at them?"

00:56:40.695 --> 00:56:43.097
TRAVIS: As long as you don't hit the ship.

00:56:43.097 --> 00:56:44.228
SAM: All right.

00:56:44.228 --> 00:56:45.738
TRAVIS: I'm sure you'll--

00:56:45.738 --> 00:56:48.942
SAM: (shouting) Come on you, motherfuckers! Get
ready to fire!

00:56:48.942 --> 00:56:54.811
MATT: At this point, the sails are fully unfurled.
Speed is picking up. The other ship was trying to

00:56:54.811 --> 00:56:59.112
gain speed, and it is a very fast ship, but as it
tries to move away it ends up putting you at a

00:56:59.112 --> 00:57:10.304
parallel pace. At which point, the master gunner
leans into you and goes "Ahem. About now would be

00:57:10.304 --> 00:57:11.503
"fine, I think."

00:57:11.503 --> 00:57:12.692
SAM: To fire?

00:57:12.692 --> 00:57:14.554
MATT: "We want them to slow down, eh?"

00:57:14.554 --> 00:57:20.029
SAM: All right. I'm so excited. I'm just going to
take a swig.

00:57:20.029 --> 00:57:26.913
MATT: He gets behind you and-- not quite like
making the vase in Ghost, but is trying to help

00:57:26.913 --> 00:57:30.911
show you exactly how to set things up and get the
cannon ready and aim it.

00:57:30.911 --> 00:57:32.100
SAM: Are you with us?

00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:35.194
TRAVIS: I'm going to leave you to it. I'm going
back upstairs.

00:57:35.194 --> 00:57:39.248
SAM: Okay I'll cast a quick Message and say: Fjord
I'm about to fire my warning shot. Good to go? You

00:57:39.248 --> 00:57:41.661
can respond to this message.

00:57:41.661 --> 00:57:43.642
TRAVIS: At your will, yeah.

00:57:43.642 --> 00:57:49.314
SAM: All right. I will light the fuse? I don't
know how you do it.

00:57:49.314 --> 00:57:54.257
TALIESIN: Powder, ball, make ready, fire.

00:57:54.257 --> 00:57:56.878
MATT: Powder, place the shot, put the fuse in, aim
then fire.

00:57:56.878 --> 00:57:58.774
SAM: Okay. Do I have to roll for this?

00:57:58.774 --> 00:58:02.587
MATT: Yeah. Go ahead and make an intelligence
check.

00:58:02.587 --> 00:58:04.378
SAM: Okay, that's a natural one.

00:58:04.378 --> 00:58:05.832
LAURA: Oh no.

00:58:05.832 --> 00:58:08.618
TALIESIN: I'm so excited!

00:58:08.618 --> 00:58:10.525
LIAM: What the fuck.

00:58:10.525 --> 00:58:11.477
MATT: Okay.

00:58:11.477 --> 00:58:17.197
SAM: Ready! Aim!

00:58:17.197 --> 00:58:19.012
TRAVIS: The cannon goes (creaking).

00:58:19.012 --> 00:58:20.977
MATT: You light the fuse.

00:58:20.977 --> 00:58:21.921
SAM: Fire!

00:58:21.921 --> 00:58:25.204
MATT: (sizzling)

00:58:25.204 --> 00:58:28.529
SAM: What happened? What's going on?

00:58:28.529 --> 00:58:31.488
MATT: "What order did you put them in?"

00:58:31.488 --> 00:58:39.709
SAM: I put the fuse in first and then I put the
powder in and then one of the balls? Is that right?

00:58:40.887 --> 00:58:42.684
MATT: "I don't think that's how--"

00:58:42.684 --> 00:58:43.712
SAM: Maybe I did them--

00:58:43.712 --> 00:58:45.076
MATT: "I think you fucked it up."

00:58:45.076 --> 00:58:46.732
SAM: I think I did the ball first and then the
powder.

00:58:46.732 --> 00:58:49.296
MATT: "I think that's-- right, we're going to have
to clean that cannon."

00:58:49.296 --> 00:58:49.981
SAM: Shit!

00:58:49.981 --> 00:58:51.172
MATT: "You're going to have to clean that
cannon."

00:58:51.172 --> 00:58:51.982
SAM: Let's go to another cannon!

00:58:51.982 --> 00:58:56.863
MATT: "All right, we'll move over to this one." So
you begin setting up the other cannon.

00:58:56.863 --> 00:58:57.767
SAM: Uh-huh.

00:58:57.767 --> 00:59:03.775
MATT: So you put the powder first, put the ball,
get the-- (explosion) The other cannon goes off.

00:59:03.775 --> 00:59:07.866
TALIESIN: At least you weren't looking in it.

00:59:07.866 --> 00:59:14.116
MATT: There's a shaking sound with splintering
wood and a bit of smoke in the vicinity. You

00:59:14.116 --> 00:59:16.319
glance over and that cannon is fucked.

00:59:16.319 --> 00:59:19.512
LAURA: I come running in. Do I need to fix a
hole?

00:59:19.512 --> 00:59:21.600
SAM: It's not wood, but sure.

00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:25.812
LIAM: Caleb runs up from under the deck with
sulfur in one hand and bat shit in the other one.

00:59:25.812 --> 00:59:28.192
What is going on? What is this?

00:59:28.192 --> 00:59:28.860
SAM: Sorry!

00:59:28.860 --> 00:59:29.617
LIAM: What are we doing?

00:59:29.617 --> 00:59:31.081
SAM: Technical difficulties.

00:59:31.081 --> 00:59:33.576
MARISHA: Can somebody please tell us what the fuck
is going on?

00:59:33.576 --> 00:59:35.504
TALIESIN: We are apparently committing an act of
piracy.

00:59:35.504 --> 00:59:41.236
MATT: At this point Ophiscan sees this and knowing
your skill set goes, "Go back upstairs. There's a

00:59:41.236 --> 00:59:43.177
"lot of powder in this room."

00:59:43.177 --> 00:59:44.376
LIAM: Aren't we--oh. Oh!

00:59:44.376 --> 00:59:45.750
MATT: "Upstairs."

00:59:45.750 --> 00:59:46.488
LIAM: You're good?

00:59:46.488 --> 00:59:49.854
MATT: "Fireboy. Go. Go get."

00:59:49.854 --> 00:59:51.703
SAM: I was born to do this.

00:59:51.703 --> 00:59:58.285
MATT: "All right, so you owe us a cannon. Try
again."

00:59:58.285 --> 01:00:00.070
LAURA: I use the cantrip Mending.

01:00:00.070 --> 01:00:07.575
MATT: We'll see if that would help a destroyed
cannon.

01:00:07.575 --> 01:00:09.212
LAURA: Probably not.

01:00:09.212 --> 01:00:11.045
MATT: That's a lot of material.

01:00:11.045 --> 01:00:12.462
LIAM: I could fix it.

01:00:12.462 --> 01:00:16.057
MATT: A single break or tear-- no. That cannon's
fucked.

01:00:16.057 --> 01:00:20.547
LAURA: One little thing goes (squeaking).

01:00:20.547 --> 01:00:25.617
MATT: All right, try it again. The DC is lower
this time because now you've fucked up.

01:00:25.617 --> 01:00:27.900
SAM: I've got this. Are they getting away?

01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:34.798
MATT: You've managed to head them off. They're
managing to get speed and they're curving this way

01:00:34.798 --> 01:00:36.222
and you guys are curving to meet them.

01:00:36.222 --> 01:00:38.003
TRAVIS: They're curving fast because there was a
detonation.

01:00:38.003 --> 01:00:38.875
MATT: Yeah.

01:00:38.875 --> 01:00:45.934
SAM: Okay, that's better. Intelligence check, 20.
Couldn't be more different.

01:00:45.934 --> 01:00:54.457
MATT: Without issue this time, proper order with a
rapid pace. Halfway through, Ophiscan's like, "Eh, sorry."

01:00:54.918 --> 01:00:56.917
SAM: Hey, back off old man.

01:00:56.917 --> 01:01:05.021
MATT: You set it, light the fuse. (explosion) The
whole thing lurches back about two feet and

01:01:05.021 --> 01:01:09.589
there's a large wooden platform that catches it
from the impact. The room shakes for a second and

01:01:09.589 --> 01:01:17.225
you glance through the little side of the gunport
and you watch it hit the water maybe about 40 feet

01:01:17.225 --> 01:01:22.717
out from the front of the other ship. You hear
shouting from the other ship and you watch as it

01:01:22.717 --> 01:01:28.347
starts to slow and come to a slower crawl. It
begins to give up its chase.

01:01:28.347 --> 01:01:35.543
SAM: I cast Message. Fjord, mission accomplished.
Board at will! You can respond to this message.

01:01:35.543 --> 01:01:36.984
TRAVIS: Well done, Nott.

01:01:36.984 --> 01:01:38.467
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

01:01:38.467 --> 01:01:39.791
SAM: Oh boy.

01:01:39.791 --> 01:01:44.514
MATT: This is more for just a visual perspective.

01:01:44.514 --> 01:01:46.297
MARISHA: Just for visuals.

01:01:46.297 --> 01:01:53.058
SAM: You guys, if you live in the UK, you're going
to get some faster, cheaper shipping.

01:01:53.058 --> 01:01:54.572
MARISHA: Way cheaper.

01:01:54.572 --> 01:01:56.041
SAM: Of the art book.

01:01:56.041 --> 01:01:57.722
MARISHA: Uh-huh. Because books are heavy.

01:01:57.722 --> 01:02:00.867
SAM: Which going to be available what day?

01:02:00.867 --> 01:02:02.875
LAURA: Monday at nine.

01:02:02.875 --> 01:02:05.874
SAM: This is exciting, but also D&D Beyond.

01:02:05.874 --> 01:02:13.952
LAURA: Whoa, Matthew Mercer! So cool!

01:02:13.952 --> 01:02:15.549
SAM: You made those?

01:02:15.549 --> 01:02:19.518
MATT: Well no, this was sent to me by fans of the
show who actually make these, and then this I had

01:02:19.518 --> 01:02:21.664
custom made a while back in case this ever came
around.

01:02:21.664 --> 01:02:26.558
SAM: Does this ship have a grid printed on it or
carved into it?

01:02:26.558 --> 01:02:32.578
MATT: Yeah, lasered in. Just to give you
perspective, as you guys pull up from the side of

01:02:32.578 --> 01:02:37.749
this, eventually the two ships are brought in,
anchor is dropped.

01:02:37.749 --> 01:02:40.620
LAURA: Which one is ours?

01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:49.850
MATT: This is yours, here. This is the
Squalleater. On the opposite end, the crew has all

01:02:49.850 --> 01:02:56.807
moved up to the deck. They have weapons at the
ready, but not necessarily ready to fire. They're

01:02:56.807 --> 01:03:04.436
in the process of realizing they don't have much
recourse at this moment. The rest of Avantika's

01:03:04.436 --> 01:03:08.435
crew, or at least a number of them, have come up
on the deck in support. But you're the one who's

01:03:08.435 --> 01:03:09.982
helming this. What do you do?

01:03:09.982 --> 01:03:15.275
TRAVIS: I look over at Caleb. Caleb, have you any
desire to intimidate some folks?

01:03:15.275 --> 01:03:18.406
LIAM: Do you need that? Yeah, okay.

01:03:18.406 --> 01:03:20.266
TALIESIN: Do we have a name of this ship?

01:03:20.266 --> 01:03:21.499
TRAVIS: Beau's going with.

01:03:21.499 --> 01:03:22.716
MATT: The Squalleater. Oh their ship?

01:03:22.716 --> 01:03:23.996
LIAM: She is intimidating.

01:03:23.996 --> 01:03:29.652
LAURA: Hey Fjord? You know, sometimes you can be
nice to people, too. And make them think that they

01:03:29.652 --> 01:03:31.089
are friends.

01:03:31.089 --> 01:03:39.423
TRAVIS: Yeah, I don't know. That's not where I'm
going. Beau?

01:03:39.423 --> 01:03:40.232
MARISHA: Yeah?

01:03:40.232 --> 01:03:45.429
TRAVIS: Team up with Bouldergut. I want you to go
on the opposite ship and find me the captain.

01:03:45.429 --> 01:03:46.897
MARISHA: Okay.

01:03:46.897 --> 01:03:53.573
TRAVIS: Can I see how many men, now that we're
close, how many are above deck?

01:03:53.573 --> 01:04:11.785
MATT: Yes. To give you kind of a brief perspective
here, what you see on deck, off to the side. Those

01:04:11.785 --> 01:04:18.600
are the people you see. Some of them appear to be
deckhands and aren't armed aside from a small

01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:24.117
shortsword on their side. A couple of them appear
to be a little better dressed, but none of them

01:04:24.117 --> 01:04:32.685
are warriors. They don't appear to have a very
visible guard on the deck of the ship.

01:04:32.685 --> 01:04:36.245
TRAVIS: Okay. Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

01:04:36.245 --> 01:04:37.949
MATT: No, go ahead.

01:04:37.949 --> 01:04:42.974
TRAVIS: I'm coming with you, just keep an eye out
and make sure no one is doing any shifty biz.

01:04:42.974 --> 01:04:45.750
MARISHA: And you want no violence here
whatsoever?

01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:51.117
TRAVIS: Not unless-- Rules of engagement apply. Do
not fire or attack unless fired upon.

01:04:51.117 --> 01:04:53.779
TALIESIN: Do you want me to make an announcement,
maybe?

01:04:53.779 --> 01:04:54.816
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:04:57.826 --> 01:05:01.438
TALIESIN: Thaumaturgy, I'm going to project my
voice very loudly onto the other ship.

01:05:01.438 --> 01:05:03.033
MATT: Okay.

01:05:03.033 --> 01:05:11.097
TALIESIN: Fellow friends at sea, we wish to have a
parlay with your captain and we hope to keep this

01:05:11.097 --> 01:05:18.307
entire confrontation as bloodless and reasonable
as humanly possible. We will do our best to be

01:05:18.307 --> 01:05:27.292
civil and not encourage anything inappropriate
over the next several minutes. We would appreciate

01:05:27.292 --> 01:05:32.799
your cooperation in this direction. Then I'm going
to try and make all the doors open and available

01:05:32.799 --> 01:05:36.637
to us from the other ship with Thaumaturgy as
well. I'm going to pop all their doors open.

01:05:36.637 --> 01:05:40.819
MATT: Soon as that sentence comes to an end, you
hear a rapid clattering of heavy wood against

01:05:40.819 --> 01:05:45.752
wood. It's all of the various ports and doors in
the interior of the ship all manage to slam open

01:05:45.752 --> 01:05:50.546
at once. All the members on the opposite side look
at each other. Make an intimidation check.

01:05:50.546 --> 01:05:57.410
TALIESIN: What number is that? I have a number in
that, let's see what it does. That's a 22.

01:05:57.748 --> 01:06:05.386
MATT: A 22?! They all look at each other and begin
to back even further away from the edge. One of

01:06:05.386 --> 01:06:12.021
them rushes down and goes deeper into the ship and
a moment later returns with one figure which

01:06:12.021 --> 01:06:21.644
appears to be better dressed than the others. You
see very bright blonde hair and a relatively

01:06:21.644 --> 01:06:29.262
well-dressed leather tunic over decent captain's
clothing. He comes to the front and goes, "I am

01:06:29.262 --> 01:06:34.470
"the captain of The Stormcap. Who am I to be
parlaying with?"

01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:43.306
TRAVIS: I'll step forward and reach for gloves
that aren't there and not do that. My name is

01:06:43.306 --> 01:06:49.254
Fjord. I'm a representative of The Squalleater
here. If you will but humor us for a few moments,

01:06:49.254 --> 01:06:55.147
I'm afraid we're very short on supplies. We need
to replenish our stores and perhaps enrich our

01:06:55.147 --> 01:07:03.170
pockets. If your men behave, I'm sure we will all
get out of this very little worse for wear.

01:07:03.170 --> 01:07:10.374
MATT: "I am Captain Jules Errog of The Stormcap,
and I would very much like the lives of my men

01:07:10.374 --> 01:07:18.007
"spared. What supplies do you need? Perhaps there
can be a trade organized."

01:07:18.007 --> 01:07:23.311
TRAVIS: Indeed. Deuce, food? Water?

01:07:23.311 --> 01:07:27.780
TALIESIN: Definitely food and water. We are also
in the need of some gems if possible. I'll also

01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:32.982
say that if they require any healing at all, for
anybody that might be sickly on the ship. I'd be

01:07:32.982 --> 01:07:34.491
happy to offer my services.

01:07:34.491 --> 01:07:39.481
TRAVIS: Oh indeed yes, the well being of your men
obviously, was something that we would easily tend to.

01:07:39.831 --> 01:07:45.314
MATT: His expression gets really confused. It's
like, "Okay?"

01:07:45.314 --> 01:07:48.162
MARISHA: What's Captain Avantika doing right now?

01:07:48.162 --> 01:07:52.639
MATT: Avantika is on the other ship just leaning
against the opposite side watching this happen,

01:07:52.639 --> 01:07:54.748
just keeping an eye on everything.

01:07:54.748 --> 01:08:00.035
TRAVIS: Now in exchange for our good will in this
interaction, I'm sure you won't mind if we peruse

01:08:00.035 --> 01:08:02.614
below decks and see if there is anything of
interest.

01:08:02.614 --> 01:08:07.555
MATT: Looks across to the rest of his men, looks
over towards you again.

01:08:07.555 --> 01:08:09.433
TALIESIN: I'm, by the way, human looking right
now.

01:08:09.433 --> 01:08:10.583
MATT: Okay.

01:08:10.583 --> 01:08:12.141
TALIESIN: Smeed.

01:08:12.141 --> 01:08:22.478
MATT: The intimidating Thaumaturgy-casting Smeed.
"Okay. Do as you will."

01:08:22.478 --> 01:08:31.831
TRAVIS: Fantastic. Bouldergut! I'll call the ogre
up to just board their ship and stay on the

01:08:31.831 --> 01:08:34.062
gangplank between ours and theirs.

01:08:34.062 --> 01:08:38.733
MATT: Bouldergut takes a step towards the
gangplank and goes "Grrr." Looks over at Avantika

01:08:38.733 --> 01:08:44.351
who shouts, "Perhaps not having her on the plank
is a good idea?"

01:08:44.351 --> 01:08:49.378
TRAVIS: Oh no, I'm sorry, on their ship, on that
side of the gangplank.

01:08:49.378 --> 01:08:54.775
MATT: Bouldergut backs up and does a running jump
and hits the other side and you watch the ship

01:08:54.775 --> 01:09:01.728
shift in the water from the impact and the weight
of this ogre. So now you have that.

01:09:01.728 --> 01:09:10.242
TRAVIS: Our friend here is going to play chaperone
and ensure everyone stays nice and happy up here.

01:09:10.242 --> 01:09:12.355
Beau, would you mind coming with me?

01:09:12.355 --> 01:09:14.275
MARISHA: Yeah, absolutely.

01:09:14.275 --> 01:09:16.036
TALIESIN: Let us know if you need anything.

01:09:16.036 --> 01:09:22.785
TRAVIS: Will do. Again, I must emphasize, no
tricky business. We're in good moods. It would be

01:09:22.785 --> 01:09:25.031
smart to keep it that way.

01:09:25.031 --> 01:09:30.169
LIAM: I fire off a Fire Bolt straight up into the
sky in an arc over and let it land in the ocean.

01:09:30.169 --> 01:09:31.415
MATT: A Fire Bolt?

01:09:31.415 --> 01:09:36.828
LIAM: Yeah, a Fire Bolt. You don't want us to be
unhappy.

01:09:36.828 --> 01:09:40.491
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

01:09:40.491 --> 01:09:48.141
LIAM: 11.

01:09:48.141 --> 01:09:59.157
MATT: Okay. The captain thinks to himself and
nods. He turns and steps aside from the doorway

01:09:59.157 --> 01:10:01.018
that he's been standing in.

01:10:01.018 --> 01:10:05.772
TRAVIS: I motion to a third so it's not just Beau
and myself. One of the other crew members of The

01:10:05.772 --> 01:10:08.119
Squalleater to come with us downstairs.

01:10:08.119 --> 01:10:13.327
MATT: Okay. At your disposal right there would
probably be Vera, who is the previous

01:10:13.327 --> 01:10:21.719
quartermaster, but she is a bit older, not quite
geriatric, but is in her older years.

01:10:21.719 --> 01:10:23.394
SAM: (cooing) Yasha!

01:10:23.394 --> 01:10:28.870
MARISHA: We're trying to go with Squalleater
people. Waldok?

01:10:28.870 --> 01:10:31.434
TRAVIS: Vera, Ipess?

01:10:31.434 --> 01:10:34.896
MARISHA: Ipess or Waldok?

01:10:34.896 --> 01:10:41.445
MATT: Vera, Ipess, or Norgul. Vera Norgul is her
name. Who are you calling?

01:10:41.445 --> 01:10:48.064
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's have Ipess come.

01:10:48.064 --> 01:10:59.541
MATT: A giant bushy bearded gnome comes by and he
has his shortsword drawn. "All right. Let's do it.

01:10:59.541 --> 01:11:05.531
Lead on!" The three of you make it across the
gangplanks and now the group is four of you

01:11:05.531 --> 01:11:11.064
including Bouldergut. The large opening that leads
down into the ship, the rest--

01:11:11.064 --> 01:11:12.621
MARISHA: Where is the captain's quarters?

01:11:12.621 --> 01:11:15.432
MATT: The captain's quarters is underneath in the
back.

01:11:15.432 --> 01:11:18.762
MARISHA: Be right back. I'm going to go into the
captain's quarters.

01:11:18.762 --> 01:11:26.221
MATT: Okay. As you head down, almost everybody
who's on the ship is up top. You see a few figures

01:11:26.488 --> 01:11:33.153
that are deckhands cowering in rooms. They're
scared shitless and when you begin walk past you

01:11:33.153 --> 01:11:40.443
hear (shushing). They're trying to stay quiet.
You're in the captain's quarters. What are you doing?

01:11:40.443 --> 01:11:46.118
MARISHA: I'm looking for any type of important
paperwork, correspondence, what these guys are,

01:11:46.118 --> 01:11:47.947
traveling logs.

01:11:47.947 --> 01:11:49.789
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:11:49.789 --> 01:11:54.049
LIAM: Also, when you are down there, you hear in
the back of your skull: Books!

01:11:54.049 --> 01:12:02.511
MARISHA: And books! Frumpkin, what are you doing?
I put Frumpkin on my shoulder. I rolled a natural

01:12:02.511 --> 01:12:05.553
19, so 24.

01:12:05.553 --> 01:12:12.239
MATT: A number of shipping ledgers. There are
books keeping tabs on payments to the crew and how

01:12:12.458 --> 01:12:19.779
long they've been hired. There is one paper you do
find that is hidden in a locked compartment

01:12:19.779 --> 01:12:24.531
beneath, but you manage to find underneath this
little bit that you can slip your fingers through,

01:12:24.531 --> 01:12:31.916
and pull a sheet of paper out on the opposite end
of the shelf. This is a list of the supplies on

01:12:31.916 --> 01:12:32.733
the ship.

01:12:32.733 --> 01:12:34.747
MARISHA: Anything of interest?

01:12:34.747 --> 01:12:42.267
MATT: There is food and water for the journey.
There are Clovis Concord spices, Menagerie Coast

01:12:42.267 --> 01:12:50.115
specialty dried meats, tropical fruits that are
specifically frozen and brought so they're slowly

01:12:50.115 --> 01:12:52.867
thawing through the journey to get them as fresh
as they can where they're going. This looks like

01:12:52.867 --> 01:13:02.261
this journey was intended to go to Marquet, to
Port Damali, The Bay of Gifts. Amongst all the

01:13:02.261 --> 01:13:08.833
various bits of general supplies, cloths,
clothing, and silks that are specific to the

01:13:08.833 --> 01:13:16.211
Menagerie Coast, there are some elements of Empire
goods as well that are put in there. But the thing

01:13:16.211 --> 01:13:20.388
that catches your interest: there is one last
addition. Everything else seems to be written in

01:13:20.388 --> 01:13:23.579
one type of handwriting, and there is a different
type of handwriting in the final entry, and the

01:13:23.579 --> 01:13:37.291
final entry says, "Requested package: guarded,"
and the amount that was paid for that was 1,800

01:13:37.291 --> 01:13:43.542
gold. That was received by the captain on this
ledger to keep on the down low.

01:13:43.542 --> 01:13:48.028
MARISHA: I'm going to immediately look around. Do
I see any of the safes where you would hide a

01:13:48.028 --> 01:13:50.302
guarded package in here?

01:13:50.302 --> 01:13:53.318
MATT: In here? You do not, not within this
chamber.

01:13:53.318 --> 01:13:59.422
MARISHA: All right. I go meet Fjord and Norgul.
Nope! Ipess. That's who's with us, I go meet them.

01:14:00.066 --> 01:14:05.884
MATT: Okay. While you're looking, are you waiting
for Beau or are you heading out?

01:14:05.884 --> 01:14:07.103
TRAVIS: Yeah, we go together.

01:14:07.103 --> 01:14:08.587
MATT: Beau joins up with you guys.

01:14:08.587 --> 01:14:10.706
TRAVIS: What'd you find?

01:14:10.706 --> 01:14:14.787
MARISHA: Oh, an entire inventory of the ship. That
looks interesting!

01:14:14.787 --> 01:14:18.033
TRAVIS: Oh, yes, indeed it does.

01:14:18.033 --> 01:14:20.384
MARISHA: Who wants to ask about that?

01:14:20.384 --> 01:14:22.324
TRAVIS: Oh, I believe I will.

01:14:22.324 --> 01:14:28.116
MATT: Actually, as high your investigation check
was, and you continued investigation into the room

01:14:28.116 --> 01:14:36.756
in search of any sort of thing, you do not find
this package, but you do find underneath under the

01:14:36.756 --> 01:14:43.491
small, tossed, somewhat mildewed rugs that mark
the floor, there is a section of floorboard that

01:14:43.491 --> 01:14:51.080
pulls open, and there is a small chest that is
locked. When you pull and shake it a bit, it's

01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:52.901
filled with quite a bit of coin.

01:14:52.901 --> 01:14:56.577
MARISHA: I grab the whole chest. Is it heavy?

01:14:56.577 --> 01:14:57.686
MATT: It's pretty heavy.

01:14:57.686 --> 01:15:02.607
MARISHA: I grab the whole chest. (grunting)

01:15:02.607 --> 01:15:04.580
TRAVIS: Nice! First room!

01:15:04.580 --> 01:15:07.090
MARISHA: Yeah, that's pretty good. Feel pretty
proud of that.

01:15:07.090 --> 01:15:08.754
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's real good.

01:15:08.754 --> 01:15:14.619
MARISHA: Do you think this is the shipment? Think
this is that? Would I deduce this is that, or no?

01:15:14.619 --> 01:15:17.681
MATT: As you are moving and shifting it, it sounds
like it's filled with a lot of coin.

01:15:17.681 --> 01:15:20.450
MARISHA: There's a different package here.

01:15:20.450 --> 01:15:28.924
TRAVIS: Well, I'm going to find out one way. I'll
call over Bouldergut. Bouldergut, do me a favor

01:15:28.924 --> 01:15:32.019
and lob this over onto the other ship, would you?

01:15:32.632 --> 01:15:36.915
MATT: Bouldergut grabs it with one hand and walks
over. As Bouldergut makes her way onto the deck,

01:15:36.915 --> 01:15:41.112
you can see the captain notice it and sigh
loudly.

01:15:41.112 --> 01:15:45.350
TRAVIS: I know, Captain. I hate to be more of an
inconvenience than this already is, and I want to

01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:49.410
get The Stormcap on its way as quickly as
possible. Would you do me a favor and have all of

01:15:49.410 --> 01:15:53.932
your men come down here and assemble at the bow of
the ship, please? This is getting too interesting

01:15:53.932 --> 01:15:56.631
and I can't have you spread out all over the
place.

01:15:56.631 --> 01:16:02.390
MATT: "Men, please, to the bow of the ship." They
all begin to shift and make their way that

01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:07.511
direction. As the captain begins to move, goes,
"All I ask, please, is leave enough supplies for

01:16:07.511 --> 01:16:09.163
us to make our journey."

01:16:09.163 --> 01:16:11.629
TRAVIS: But of course, Captain. What are we,
monsters?

01:16:11.629 --> 01:16:16.933
MATT: Does not break eye contact with you and
gives you a serious dark glare.

01:16:16.933 --> 01:16:24.173
LIAM: I start lobbing Fire Bolts into the sea like
I'm skipping stones every ten or 15 seconds.

01:16:24.173 --> 01:16:25.627
MATT: It certainly keeps the other side nervous.

01:16:25.627 --> 01:16:28.182
LAURA: I'm waving at them. Hi.

01:16:28.182 --> 01:16:32.762
TRAVIS: We'll make our way below deck to see what
we can see.

01:16:32.762 --> 01:16:38.576
MATT: You go past into the cargo hold, which is
below here. On the level where the captain's

01:16:38.576 --> 01:16:44.630
quarters are and just below, there's the rest of
the cabin quarters for the rest of the crew, and

01:16:44.630 --> 01:16:49.511
then below that is the cargo hold. As you make
your way past the various hiding other members of

01:16:49.511 --> 01:16:56.014
the deckhand crew, down in the lower cargo hold,
there are a series of crates and barrels that

01:16:56.014 --> 01:17:01.583
contain all the supplies that were on the ledger,
you would assume, all the different trade materials.

01:17:04.559 --> 01:17:09.929
TRAVIS: I'll peek my head into one of those rooms
where the crew is hiding. I'll say: You, you, and

01:17:10.235 --> 01:17:14.798
you. Get your ass up. I want these crates taken
above deck and put on our ship. Do it quickly, do

01:17:14.798 --> 01:17:15.914
it quietly.

01:17:15.914 --> 01:17:17.830
MATT: "Which ones?"

01:17:17.830 --> 01:17:23.130
TRAVIS: I'll point out the ones with the food,
some of the water and some of those frozen fruits

01:17:23.130 --> 01:17:25.630
as well for scurvy needs.

01:17:25.630 --> 01:17:32.575
MATT: "Okay." They're all trying to keep a
distance from you, scurry down and begin lifting

01:17:32.575 --> 01:17:42.408
things, at which point a voice below goes, "What's
going on?" and they go, "Shh." They begin to move

01:17:42.408 --> 01:17:44.378
things back up to the top.

01:17:44.378 --> 01:17:50.324
TRAVIS: I'll grab one of them before they-- I
heard that.

01:17:50.324 --> 01:17:53.113
MARISHA: I crack my knuckles behind Fjord.

01:17:53.113 --> 01:17:58.677
TRAVIS: You know, if you were on the sea long
enough, you would know that I'm the type that only

01:17:58.677 --> 01:18:02.319
asks a question once. Who else is down here?

01:18:02.319 --> 01:18:04.808
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

01:18:04.808 --> 01:18:09.778
TRAVIS: 23.

01:18:09.778 --> 01:18:21.667
MATT: Eyes wide, the pupils gyrating in a very
quick, shaking motion. "I don't his name. He came

01:18:21.667 --> 01:18:26.344
"with one of the pieces of cargo. He just stays
down there."

01:18:26.344 --> 01:18:30.117
TRAVIS: That would be it. You can go on.

01:18:30.117 --> 01:18:35.381
MATT: (panting) and continues to grab and pull the
crates up.

01:18:35.381 --> 01:18:40.612
SAM: I'm going to cast Message. Fjord, we are
reloaded and ready to fire. If you want me to

01:18:40.612 --> 01:18:48.402
fire, literally reply with any word. You can reply
to this message. Fuck.

01:18:48.402 --> 01:18:52.675
(laughter)

01:18:52.675 --> 01:18:55.034
TALIESIN: Don't get greedy.

01:18:55.034 --> 01:18:58.353
TRAVIS: Well, I don't feel like we need
reinforcements for this, right?

01:18:58.353 --> 01:19:06.151
MARISHA: I feel deeply capable, but I feel deeply
capable.

01:19:06.151 --> 01:19:07.268
TRAVIS: Yasha?

01:19:07.268 --> 01:19:09.431
MARISHA: Yo, Yasha!

01:19:09.431 --> 01:19:12.415
MATT: From across the other side--

01:19:12.415 --> 01:19:16.340
MARISHA: Oh sorry. (shouting) Yasha!

01:19:16.340 --> 01:19:17.194
MATT: "Yes?"

01:19:17.194 --> 01:19:19.139
MARISHA: Come here.

01:19:19.139 --> 01:19:29.199
MATT: Bounds across the gangplank on the other
side. "What do you need?" She heads down to the

01:19:29.199 --> 01:19:31.562
ship with you.

01:19:31.562 --> 01:19:38.525
MARISHA: Think the secret package is a person.
Think there's a person, think he's the secret

01:19:38.624 --> 01:19:45.502
package because he's on this ledger and it's
different handwriting. Anyway, let's go find the person.

01:19:45.502 --> 01:19:52.779
TRAVIS: Yeah, we'll make our way further into the
hold and try to find the source of the voice.

01:19:52.779 --> 01:19:57.441
TALIESIN: Just because everyone's on the deck, I'm
going to do a quick Detect Magic and scan the boat.

01:19:57.441 --> 01:19:59.426
MATT: The whole boat?

01:19:59.426 --> 01:20:01.436
TALIESIN: Everybody in the boat.

01:20:01.436 --> 01:20:05.016
LAURA: While he's doing that, I'm going to say: I
need a volunteer!

01:20:05.016 --> 01:20:07.913
SAM: From the other crew?

01:20:07.913 --> 01:20:14.195
TALIESIN: I will also say I'm going to take it and
that chest they just threw out as well.

01:20:14.195 --> 01:20:18.420
MATT: Okay. The chest does not emit a magical
presence. In order to really check the other ship,

01:20:18.682 --> 01:20:22.037
you have to go across onto its bow and scan and
walk across it. It's a 30-foot.

01:20:22.037 --> 01:20:28.664
TALIESIN: It's 30-foot. Okay, at the very least,
I'm going to get close and walk the-- Oh, yeah.

01:20:28.664 --> 01:20:36.239
MATT: Okay. As you begin to make your way over
towards the bow, concentrating on the spell, a

01:20:36.239 --> 01:20:42.389
tiny little magic source below you, deep in the
ship, catches your attention.

01:20:42.389 --> 01:20:43.750
LAURA: In the other ship?

01:20:43.750 --> 01:20:45.193
MATT: In the other ship, yes.

01:20:45.193 --> 01:20:47.878
TALIESIN: There's something magic down below.

01:20:47.878 --> 01:20:49.111
MATT: While this is happening--

01:20:49.111 --> 01:20:52.442
SAM: I say that all the time to my lady friends,
by the way.

01:20:52.442 --> 01:20:55.573
MATT: You guys head down into the cargo hold.

01:20:55.573 --> 01:20:59.083
MARISHA: Super on edge and guarded.

01:20:59.083 --> 01:21:00.528
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:21:00.528 --> 01:21:02.819
MARISHA: Darkvision goggles. Okay.

01:21:02.819 --> 01:21:04.322
TRAVIS: I will aid you.

01:21:04.322 --> 01:21:13.442
MARISHA: Thank you. I will take it. Oh my god, I
rolled a three and a four. Seven.

01:21:13.442 --> 01:21:21.379
MATT: Okay, looking inside, it is lightless and
appears to be empty aside from the series of

01:21:21.379 --> 01:21:25.435
crates and shipping containers that are in here,
other than the ones that you've had moved up to

01:21:25.435 --> 01:21:31.822
the top. Between the three of them, they've done
two quick up-and-downs. They've brought a fair

01:21:31.822 --> 01:21:34.547
amount of supplies so far, and they'll continue if
you tell them to.

01:21:34.547 --> 01:21:36.856
MARISHA: I can't see shit, but I don't trust it.

01:21:36.856 --> 01:21:37.759
TRAVIS: I can.

01:21:37.759 --> 01:21:46.342
MARISHA: You know, maybe if I readjust. Let me
just close my eyes for a second. Okay, why don't

01:21:46.342 --> 01:21:47.368
you try?

01:21:47.368 --> 01:21:52.457
TRAVIS: Yeah, can I give it a better look with my
darkvision?

01:21:52.457 --> 01:21:54.266
MATT: No, because you spent your turn helping
her.

01:21:54.266 --> 01:21:55.367
TRAVIS: That's right, I'm helping her. Of course.

01:21:55.367 --> 01:21:57.214
MATT: Technically it's both of you looking.

01:21:57.214 --> 01:22:01.534
LIAM: Okay, Caduceus aired the fact that he is a
little nervous, so I place my hand on Caduceus'

01:22:01.534 --> 01:22:05.333
shoulder and then look through Frumpkin's eyes to
see what's going on.

01:22:05.333 --> 01:22:10.138
TALIESIN: I'm getting a little bit of magic down
there, I don't know what it is, but it's making me nervous.

01:22:10.441 --> 01:22:12.019
MATT: Okay. Looking through Frumpkin's eyes, make
a perception check.

01:22:12.019 --> 01:22:14.740
LIAM: Oh, I wasn't trying to do a perception
check. I'm not searching for anything, I'm just

01:22:14.740 --> 01:22:15.317
checking in.

01:22:15.317 --> 01:22:18.100
MATT: You're just keeping an eye? Okay. So you're
just keeping tabs on the situation.

01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:20.067
LIAM: That's exactly what I want to do.

01:22:20.067 --> 01:22:26.342
LAURA: I just want to let it known that I'm asking
for a volunteer from the other crew.

01:22:26.342 --> 01:22:27.270
TALIESIN: Oh god.

01:22:27.270 --> 01:22:28.909
LAURA: I need a volunteer!

01:22:28.909 --> 01:22:31.367
MATT: They all look at each other.

01:22:31.367 --> 01:22:35.599
LAURA: It can be anyone, but there should be at
least one!

01:22:35.649 --> 01:22:40.073
MATT: The captain steps forward and goes, "For
what?"

01:22:40.564 --> 01:22:44.151
LAURA: For a special present! It's a treat!

01:22:44.151 --> 01:22:47.176
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

01:22:47.176 --> 01:22:48.900
SAM: That sounds awful.

01:22:48.900 --> 01:22:51.554
TALIESIN: That sounds like the worst thing ever.
Oh man.

01:22:51.554 --> 01:22:52.619
LAURA: 17.

01:22:52.619 --> 01:22:55.727
SAM: A treat.

01:22:55.727 --> 01:22:57.772
MATT: "Go, Lieb. That way."

01:22:57.772 --> 01:22:58.513
LAURA: Liam?

01:22:58.513 --> 01:22:59.438
MATT: Lieb.

01:22:59.438 --> 01:23:01.011
LAURA: Lieb.

01:23:01.011 --> 01:23:04.497
MATT: I know, so close. One of the deck hands
looks and he goes, "What, me?"

01:23:04.497 --> 01:23:07.426
LAURA: Come on!

01:23:07.426 --> 01:23:10.121
MATT: Onto The Squalleater?

01:23:10.121 --> 01:23:11.897
LAURA: Yeah. Come sit next to me!

01:23:11.897 --> 01:23:14.689
MATT: He comes across the gangplank over next to
you.

01:23:14.689 --> 01:23:18.559
LAURA: I bust out the tattoo stuff that Orly's
been teaching me. I'm going to give him a tat

01:23:18.559 --> 01:23:20.462
while all that's going on!

01:23:20.462 --> 01:23:25.147
(laughter)

01:23:25.147 --> 01:23:27.662
TALIESIN: This is the darkest timeline. Oh.

01:23:27.662 --> 01:23:29.700
TRAVIS: Unmolested, except for--

01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:32.282
TALIESIN: And that's how I got this!

01:23:32.282 --> 01:23:34.267
LAURA: Where do you want it?

01:23:34.267 --> 01:23:35.688
TALIESIN: I'm having bad flashbacks.

01:23:35.688 --> 01:23:37.816
MATT: He's just like, "I-- what?"

01:23:37.816 --> 01:23:40.548
LAURA: It'll be so good. It's going to be so
beautiful.

01:23:40.548 --> 01:23:45.321
SAM: This poor guy!

01:23:45.321 --> 01:23:49.008
MARISHA: You've got to test on somebody.

01:23:49.008 --> 01:23:54.457
LAURA: Ooh, I like it! Let's get your clothes
open. While everything's going on, I'm just going

01:23:54.457 --> 01:23:54.846
to spend--

01:23:54.846 --> 01:23:58.593
MATT: While you're prepping, he just looks over at
the captain very mournfully, and the captain's like--

01:23:58.601 --> 01:24:04.974
LAURA: It's just going to be one smiley line with
two tusks sticking out of it.

01:24:04.974 --> 01:24:06.142
SAM: Oh!

01:24:06.142 --> 01:24:07.461
TALIESIN: Vampire.

01:24:07.461 --> 01:24:10.013
LAURA: You've been abducted-- no, by Captain
Tusktooth.

01:24:10.013 --> 01:24:12.037
MATT: Make a dexterity check.

01:24:12.037 --> 01:24:14.827
MARISHA: Like, you've been abducted,
congratulations.

01:24:14.827 --> 01:24:17.714
LAURA: Ooh! 19!

01:24:17.714 --> 01:24:22.966
MATT: So over the next ten minutes or so, you'll
be able to provide a fine tattoo of that simple design.

01:24:23.221 --> 01:24:24.809
LAURA: Yeah, just like a smiley face, but with
tusks.

01:24:24.809 --> 01:24:28.530
MATT: You got it. He's biting his lip (groaning).

01:24:28.530 --> 01:24:31.049
LAURA: Just deal with it, it's going to be good.

01:24:31.049 --> 01:24:34.559
TRAVIS: I'll make my way forward into the hold
even though we haven't seen much.

01:24:34.559 --> 01:24:43.110
MATT: Okay. You move ahead into the hold about ten
feet or so. There's a small pathway that's built

01:24:43.110 --> 01:24:46.995
between all the different elements of crates and
barrels, making sure that you can get to the back

01:24:46.995 --> 01:24:48.050
of the hold.

01:24:48.050 --> 01:24:50.096
MARISHA: Plug! Sorry.

01:24:50.096 --> 01:24:51.672
MATT: They're not a sponsor.

01:24:51.672 --> 01:24:53.934
MARISHA: Actually, not sponsored.

01:24:53.934 --> 01:24:59.528
MATT: As you move around the corner, in a flash,
you hear (grunting). You see this quick arc of

01:24:59.528 --> 01:25:10.167
steel as suddenly, from around the corner, a
fairly well-armed man with sun-darkened skin,

01:25:10.167 --> 01:25:19.595
short hair pulled into a tight top-knot or a bun
of some kind, holding a longsword two-handed,

01:25:19.595 --> 01:25:27.212
swings at you, three strikes. That is 24 to hit.

01:25:27.212 --> 01:25:28.286
TRAVIS: Hits.

01:25:28.286 --> 01:25:30.538
MATT: That is 18 to hit.

01:25:30.538 --> 01:25:31.735
TRAVIS: Hits.

01:25:31.735 --> 01:25:34.580
MATT: And, ooh, that is a 26 to hit.

01:25:34.580 --> 01:25:36.224
TRAVIS: Misses.

01:25:36.224 --> 01:25:52.148
MATT: Three hits there. That is 16 points of
slashing damage, 13 points of slashing damage,

01:25:52.148 --> 01:25:55.558
and, oh, 18 points of slashing damage.

01:25:55.558 --> 01:25:57.331
TRAVIS: Amazing.

01:25:57.331 --> 01:26:03.799
LIAM: I call out up there: Captain, your
quartermaster is under attack.

01:26:03.799 --> 01:26:05.238
LAURA: How do you know that?

01:26:05.238 --> 01:26:06.617
MARISHA: He's looking through Frumpkin.

01:26:06.617 --> 01:26:07.837
LAURA: Oh, cool.

01:26:07.837 --> 01:26:13.198
MATT: Avantika listens and goes, "Ah, I trust he
can take care of himself, eh?"

01:26:13.198 --> 01:26:15.750
TALIESIN: You want to send me down?

01:26:15.750 --> 01:26:18.608
LIAM: We'll see.

01:26:18.608 --> 01:26:19.815
TALIESIN: All right.

01:26:19.815 --> 01:26:26.180
MATT: Now I need you to roll initiative, you to
roll initiative, and roll initiative for Yasha,

01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:27.536
and I'll do for Bouldergut.

01:26:27.536 --> 01:26:35.903
MARISHA: Oh my god, I don't know if I trust Gil.
I'm sorry, Gil, but I don't trust you. 18. I'll

01:26:35.903 --> 01:26:37.336
take that 18.

01:26:37.336 --> 01:26:43.792
MATT: 25 to 20? Beau, you're 18?

01:26:43.792 --> 01:26:46.060
TRAVIS: Yasha rolled a 19.

01:26:46.060 --> 01:26:48.486
MATT: Oh, so Yasha's up first.

01:26:48.486 --> 01:26:50.348
TRAVIS: I rolled a six.

01:26:50.348 --> 01:27:05.393
MATT: Okay, good to know. Yasha is up first.
Seeing this flashing of blades across Fjord, Fjord

01:27:05.455 --> 01:27:09.692
gets knocked back, careening into some of the
nearby crates. They shift from the impact, you

01:27:09.692 --> 01:27:14.037
hear the cracking of wood. As soon as the figure
pulls back, getting the blade into defensive

01:27:14.037 --> 01:27:18.490
position, backing up against a corner with that
was set with a table and a chair, and this is

01:27:18.490 --> 01:27:24.479
essentially the guarding post of this figure
below. There's a very faint bit of light in the

01:27:24.479 --> 01:27:28.348
corner from a hooded lantern that's been faced
towards the inside of the crates so it wouldn't

01:27:28.348 --> 01:27:32.467
give any sort of light that revealed his location.
You see him going into a defensive position.

01:27:32.467 --> 01:27:33.654
Yasha's up first. Yasha?

01:27:33.654 --> 01:27:34.651
TRAVIS: Does he look armored?

01:27:34.651 --> 01:27:36.377
MATT: Armored? Yes, half-plate.

01:27:36.377 --> 01:27:42.109
TRAVIS: With her bonus action, she will rage and
she will make two attacks with the Magician's Judge.

01:27:42.109 --> 01:27:43.693
MATT: Go for it.

01:27:44.326 --> 01:27:46.722
TRAVIS: That's not good. That's an 11.

01:27:46.722 --> 01:27:50.302
MATT: 11 misses. The blade scrapes across his
armor, no impact.

01:27:50.302 --> 01:27:51.820
TRAVIS: And a 12.

01:27:51.820 --> 01:27:55.221
MATT: The first one scrapes across the armor,
causing a couple sparks to fly and briefly

01:27:55.221 --> 01:27:59.201
lighting up his position. The second time he
actually pulls the longsword up and manages to

01:27:59.201 --> 01:28:03.372
parry and cause the blade to completely miss,
impacting and getting stuck about an inch into the

01:28:03.372 --> 01:28:08.800
wood before she draws back angrily, gritting her
teeth. That ends Yasha's turn. Beau, you're up.

01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:14.681
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to come up and I'm going
to parkour off of one of the crates and I'm going

01:28:14.681 --> 01:28:20.732
to try and come down and I want to nail him in the
temple and try and do a stunning strike. First,

01:28:20.732 --> 01:28:21.890
I'm just going to try and hit him.

01:28:21.890 --> 01:28:22.853
MATT: All right.

01:28:22.853 --> 01:28:30.264
MARISHA: While I'm doing this, I'm going to be
like: Frumpkin, help! Okay, 19?

01:28:30.264 --> 01:28:31.664
MATT: 19 hits.

01:28:31.664 --> 01:28:34.894
LIAM: I actually want to ask Frumpkin to do
something from on deck.

01:28:34.894 --> 01:28:36.238
MATT: All right, roll initiative.

01:28:36.238 --> 01:28:37.369
LIAM: Okay.

01:28:37.369 --> 01:28:41.452
SAM: Does she get advantage on barrels because
she's a cooper?

01:28:45.156 --> 01:28:52.852
MARISHA: I'm using my elbow. Fucking balls, why
does this keep happening to me? Five points of

01:28:52.852 --> 01:28:55.591
damage on that first one, and I'm going to do a
stunning strike.

01:28:55.591 --> 01:29:00.124
MATT: Stunning strike on him? That's a con save.
That was out of the box there.

01:29:00.124 --> 01:29:02.395
MARISHA: It needs to be garbage.

01:29:02.395 --> 01:29:06.691
MATT: He has a pretty decent con, but he only
rolled a 15.

01:29:06.691 --> 01:29:07.896
MARISHA: Nope.

01:29:07.896 --> 01:29:08.661
MATT: What's the DC?

01:29:08.661 --> 01:29:09.392
MARISHA: 14.

01:29:09.392 --> 01:29:10.779
MATT: 14, yeah, he saves on that one.

01:29:10.779 --> 01:29:16.417
MARISHA: Hang on, wait. It's my proficiency bonus
plus my-- because I was afraid that I had been

01:29:16.417 --> 01:29:21.905
fucking this up-- plus my wisdom, which is--

01:29:21.905 --> 01:29:24.083
MATT: It's eight plus your proficiency bonus plus
your wisdom.

01:29:24.083 --> 01:29:27.769
MARISHA: (counting) 14. Nope, it's still 14.

01:29:27.769 --> 01:29:32.331
MATT: Yeah, so the first strike hits him across
the head, but he manages to resist it. He pulls

01:29:32.331 --> 01:29:35.867
back (grunting), teeth gritted.

01:29:36.673 --> 01:29:40.909
MARISHA: Pop, pop. Do it again. First hit, 20.

01:29:40.909 --> 01:29:44.450
MATT: 20 hits. Roll damage for the second strike.

01:29:44.450 --> 01:29:47.092
MARISHA: Bullshit damage. Six.

01:29:47.092 --> 01:29:49.850
MATT: Six points of damage.

01:29:49.850 --> 01:29:51.682
MARISHA: You said his con was good?

01:29:51.682 --> 01:29:54.633
MATT: You don't know. It seemed to be pretty
decent; he rolled a 15 on that one. But you can

01:29:54.633 --> 01:29:56.096
try it again.

01:29:56.096 --> 01:29:58.403
MARISHA: One more time. Ki point.

01:29:58.403 --> 01:30:02.572
MATT: Another ki point. That is a 12.

01:30:02.572 --> 01:30:06.005
MARISHA: He's stunned!

01:30:06.005 --> 01:30:09.622
MATT: First strike, no impact, he pulls back. He's
rearing to try and deflect, or at least keep you

01:30:09.622 --> 01:30:14.847
at bay. The second strike, as you crack right
across the side of the head, he goes down onto one

01:30:14.847 --> 01:30:19.896
knee. You see him, his eyes go wide as they're
rolling a little bit in his skull, and he's

01:30:19.896 --> 01:30:24.095
currently trying to shake-- You rung his bell. You
still have your bonus action.

01:30:24.095 --> 01:30:28.098
MARISHA: My bonus action--

01:30:28.098 --> 01:30:29.865
MATT: With advantage, if you're--

01:30:29.865 --> 01:30:39.990
MARISHA: Oh wait, he's stunned! Yeah, that's an 18
to hit, a natural 18. And another goddamn one! Five.

01:30:39.990 --> 01:30:46.176
MATT: Five points of damage. He's stunned and on
his knee.

01:30:46.176 --> 01:30:52.311
MARISHA: I'm going to look at Frumpkin again and
be like: Caleb, if you're watching, I don't trust

01:30:52.311 --> 01:30:56.278
Avantika? That's probably all I can say.

01:30:56.278 --> 01:31:04.346
MATT: Okay, that brings us to Bouldergut's turn.
(laughter) Bouldergut. There's not a lot of space

01:31:04.346 --> 01:31:08.745
here, so I'm going to give her disadvantage on her
attack because she has to try and swing this large

01:31:08.745 --> 01:31:16.672
greatclub in this enclosed space as an ogre.
Charging by, (roaring), comes down to do an

01:31:16.672 --> 01:31:25.834
overhead strike. Actually, it would have advantage
because stunned, so it's just a regular roll. Let

01:31:25.834 --> 01:31:35.143
me try that again. Yeah, that's a natural 14, that
hits. For that, he takes 13 points of damage on

01:31:35.143 --> 01:31:46.104
that hit. The other attack-- 17, that hits.
Another 15 points of damage. Nice. As he's on one

01:31:46.104 --> 01:31:52.001
knee, Bouldergut comes around and she slams. He
almost falls to the ground again. The giant impact

01:31:52.001 --> 01:31:56.500
slamming into the back of the metal-- You can see
that actual armor dented inward from the impact.

01:31:56.500 --> 01:32:03.891
She pulls up for a second strike down on top. This
one actually sends him down on the ground. He's

01:32:03.891 --> 01:32:09.199
trying to get back up from that impact. The back
of the armor is pushed in. It's limited some of

01:32:09.199 --> 01:32:16.141
his mobility within his shoulder blades from the
way the metal's pushed towards his upper shoulder.

01:32:16.141 --> 01:32:18.444
That's going to end Bouldergut's turn. It's now
Frumpkin's go.

01:32:18.444 --> 01:32:23.601
LIAM: Frumpkin is going to fly over towards this
gentleman and try to, with talons, rake across his

01:32:23.601 --> 01:32:30.923
head. With advantage because he's stunned, yeah?
That's a 15 or an 18.

01:32:30.923 --> 01:32:32.337
MATT: 18 hits.

01:32:32.337 --> 01:32:39.679
LIAM: I cast Vampiric Touch through Frumpkin's
touch, and he takes 3d6 necrotic damage.

01:32:39.679 --> 01:32:41.939
SAM: Frumpkin can attack?

01:32:41.939 --> 01:32:49.748
LIAM: Through me. Me through her. Him. Damn it.
That is eight points of necrotic damage to him.

01:32:49.748 --> 01:32:51.953
TRAVIS: You can wifi suck HP out of somebody like
that?

01:32:51.953 --> 01:32:52.803
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

01:32:52.803 --> 01:32:53.833
TRAVIS: Yeah!

01:32:53.833 --> 01:32:58.802
MARISHA: I just turn to Fjord and go: Frumpkin
listens to my commands!

01:32:58.802 --> 01:33:01.340
MATT: That ends Frumpkin's go. Fjord, you're up.

01:33:01.340 --> 01:33:07.089
TRAVIS: I will stand up after having getting the
holy fucking shit knocked out of me from those

01:33:07.089 --> 01:33:13.406
longsword shots, and say: Friend! You better be
real sure this is something you want to die for. I

01:33:13.406 --> 01:33:19.395
would suggest you drop your sword. You're
outnumbered. I will take a step back.

01:33:19.395 --> 01:33:20.645
MARISHA: Nice.

01:33:20.645 --> 01:33:30.107
MATT: Make an intimidation check. Because he's
stunned and beat to shit, I'll give you advantage on it.

01:33:30.107 --> 01:33:33.129
TRAVIS: First one was a 24.

01:33:33.129 --> 01:33:35.789
MATT: Okay, that ends your turn. Yasha's up.

01:33:35.789 --> 01:33:42.147
TRAVIS: Yasha will walk up and attempt to grapple
him into a bear hug.

01:33:42.147 --> 01:33:48.194
MATT: Okay, make an athletics check for her with
advantage because she's raging.

01:33:48.194 --> 01:33:50.225
TRAVIS: 21.

01:33:50.225 --> 01:33:58.585
MATT: Okay, he fails strength and dex saving
throws. Doesn't say anything about abilities--

01:33:58.585 --> 01:34:02.447
I'll say, yeah, she grapples him, that's fine.
Beau, you're up.

01:34:02.447 --> 01:34:03.737
MARISHA: He's grappled?

01:34:03.737 --> 01:34:07.112
MATT: He's currently being held by Yasha and
looking right over at Fjord, who's backed away,

01:34:07.112 --> 01:34:10.252
hands up.

01:34:10.252 --> 01:34:17.747
MARISHA: I'm going to say: Look, me and this guy
have been trying to be better about not hurting

01:34:17.747 --> 01:34:26.010
people. You know, we're trying to watch out for
one another. The truth is, we want to talk to you.

01:34:26.010 --> 01:34:31.912
We're going to get answers from you. It's your
choice if it's going to take us beating them out

01:34:31.912 --> 01:34:41.534
of you, or if you just want to give them to us. So
I'm not going to hit you. Just know, if I feel

01:34:41.534 --> 01:34:45.998
like you're lying to me, I'll punch the living
shit out of you, and then you're going to tell me

01:34:45.998 --> 01:34:49.991
what I wanted to know anyway. Understood?

01:34:49.991 --> 01:34:51.669
MATT: That's your turn?

01:34:51.669 --> 01:34:52.904
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:34:52.904 --> 01:35:00.653
MATT: Okay. It comes to his turn, he's being held
by Yasha, and he shakes off the daze. Grits his

01:35:00.653 --> 01:35:06.730
teeth, and just throws his sword to the ground.

01:35:06.730 --> 01:35:09.661
MARISHA: We're not murder monsters!

01:35:09.661 --> 01:35:14.955
TRAVIS: Our dark-leaning thing goes tick.

01:35:14.955 --> 01:35:24.957
MATT: Four points renegade, one point paragon.
Yasha's still clutching him there. Yeah.

01:35:24.957 --> 01:35:36.013
TRAVIS: Friend. Ow! Second, we saw a little
manifest that said there was some guarded parcel

01:35:36.079 --> 01:35:43.959
down below. I can only imagine that they were
talking about you. Now, my friend was correct. She

01:35:43.959 --> 01:35:48.645
can punch the shit out of you. Also, we can see
how well you want to swim. Or, we can just make

01:35:48.645 --> 01:35:53.090
sure that you're on this boat, healed up a little
bit, and sent on your way. And you can create

01:35:53.090 --> 01:35:58.750
whatever story you want. But I do need to know
what you were protecting.

01:35:59.253 --> 01:36:04.665
MATT: He's still being grappled by Yasha, without
saying a word. There's this look of defeat and

01:36:04.665 --> 01:36:10.030
acceptance of one's pride. He's just trying
desperately not to engage more than he has to, and

01:36:10.030 --> 01:36:15.542
glances over towards a crate that is across from
where he was sitting that would still be in his

01:36:15.542 --> 01:36:24.049
visual perspective. But it's an unsuspecting crate
pushed in a cluster of others. He looks in that

01:36:24.049 --> 01:36:25.731
direction and gives a head nudge.

01:36:25.731 --> 01:36:26.971
MARISHA: I move to it.

01:36:26.971 --> 01:36:28.650
MATT: Okay.

01:36:29.445 --> 01:36:33.494
MARISHA: Before I open it, I'll look at him and
go: Is there a trap in this damn thing?

01:36:33.494 --> 01:36:36.220
LIAM: Frumpkin lands on his head.

01:36:36.220 --> 01:36:38.907
MATT: "No."

01:36:39.387 --> 01:36:43.880
MARISHA: If you're lying to me, I'll slit your
throat.

01:36:45.644 --> 01:36:47.709
TRAVIS: Do I think he's lying?

01:36:47.709 --> 01:36:50.028
MATT: Make an insight check.

01:36:52.879 --> 01:36:55.768
TRAVIS: Eight.

01:36:56.196 --> 01:36:58.864
MATT: Hard to read. He's a pretty grim fellow.
What did you say?

01:36:58.864 --> 01:37:01.816
TALIESIN: I'm going to start heading downstairs to
see what the commotion is.

01:37:01.816 --> 01:37:03.197
MATT: Okay. All right.

01:37:03.197 --> 01:37:09.926
LAURA: Would you like googly eyes on your tattoo?
Or would you just like smiley face?

01:37:09.926 --> 01:37:13.757
MATT: "Whatever you want. Please, just let me
go."

01:37:13.757 --> 01:37:17.245
LAURA: Googly eyes it is. Thank you very much.

01:37:18.047 --> 01:37:22.245
MARISHA: I open the crate very carefully.

01:37:23.312 --> 01:37:30.055
MATT: You lift it up. Looking inside, there's a
few heavy sacks of rice or grain or sand. You

01:37:30.055 --> 01:37:36.378
can't really tell. But they're all lining it for
weight on the crate. In the center, there's a

01:37:36.378 --> 01:37:44.768
pillow or a piece of folded fabric that's folded
in place in the center. You pull the fabric back,

01:37:44.768 --> 01:37:52.356
and there you see a very intricate, wooden box.
It's about maybe that big. It's about the size of

01:37:52.356 --> 01:38:00.745
a shoebox, if you will, but it's really
well-scrolled and carved wood. Like a whittler or

01:38:00.745 --> 01:38:03.912
a carver spent a lot of time to make it look very
beautiful and presentory.

01:38:03.912 --> 01:38:06.002
MARISHA: I pull that out of the crate.

01:38:06.002 --> 01:38:10.663
MATT: It has these chain handles on the sides that
dangle on the edge. It has a little latch on it,

01:38:10.663 --> 01:38:12.121
and it's locked.

01:38:12.121 --> 01:38:12.897
MARISHA: It's locked.

01:38:12.897 --> 01:38:14.488
MATT: Yeah. It's pretty light.

01:38:16.095 --> 01:38:21.947
MARISHA: Hey, Frumpkin, if you're listening, can
you have Caleb tell Nott to come down here, please?

01:38:22.725 --> 01:38:26.758
LIAM: As soon as Caleb felt Caduceus walk away, he
dropped Frumpkin's sight because he didn't want to

01:38:26.758 --> 01:38:29.894
be smacked in the face.

01:38:29.894 --> 01:38:31.569
TALIESIN: Yeah, he'd pat you a couple times.

01:38:31.569 --> 01:38:35.763
LIAM: But Frumpkin will listen to you.

01:38:35.763 --> 01:38:40.640
MATT: The captain on the stop says something like,
"Are we done yet?"

01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:43.667
TRAVIS: Nearly there.

01:38:43.667 --> 01:38:50.024
MARISHA: I look at the guy. Is this trapped?

01:38:50.024 --> 01:38:53.023
MATT: "I don't believe so."

01:38:53.023 --> 01:38:54.935
MARISHA: What's your name?

01:38:54.935 --> 01:38:56.176
MATT: (spitting)

01:38:56.176 --> 01:39:05.295
TRAVIS: Oh, I really wish you hadn't done that. I
can't guarantee her reaction to that will be a

01:39:05.295 --> 01:39:07.091
positive one.

01:39:07.091 --> 01:39:10.762
MARISHA: I'm trying real hard right now. Like, so
hard.

01:39:10.762 --> 01:39:12.487
TRAVIS: Yeah, you are. You've done really well.

01:39:12.487 --> 01:39:19.432
MATT: "You've already guaranteed I lose my job and
my wage. What more can you take from me?"

01:39:19.432 --> 01:39:21.195
TRAVIS: Are you being paid to protect this?

01:39:21.195 --> 01:39:21.976
MATT: "I was."

01:39:21.976 --> 01:39:23.069
TRAVIS: How much?

01:39:23.069 --> 01:39:30.140
MATT: "150 gold upon my return."

01:39:30.140 --> 01:39:32.873
TRAVIS: I'll give him 70 gold.

01:39:32.873 --> 01:39:34.339
MATT: You just slip it into his pouch?

01:39:34.339 --> 01:39:36.998
TRAVIS: I'll walk up and put it in his pouch as
Yasha's holding him.

01:39:36.998 --> 01:39:44.006
MATT: He looks confused and untrusting, like he's
caught off-guard by it.

01:39:44.006 --> 01:39:50.671
MARISHA: We're trying real hard, man. Like,
actively trying real hard.

01:39:53.807 --> 01:39:55.356
MATT: "Soma."

01:39:55.356 --> 01:40:02.930
MARISHA: Soma. See, now was that so hard? Did that
take you being fucking rude?

01:40:02.930 --> 01:40:06.579
MATT: He just glares at you.

01:40:06.579 --> 01:40:07.907
TRAVIS: Are you coming down under?

01:40:07.907 --> 01:40:09.875
TALIESIN: Yeah, I probably am getting down.

01:40:09.875 --> 01:40:13.015
MARISHA: Oh, hey, Cad! Will you go get Nott?

01:40:13.015 --> 01:40:14.545
TRAVIS: Actually, while you're here--

01:40:14.545 --> 01:40:17.522
TALIESIN: Whoa. Wow. Someone did a number on you.

01:40:17.522 --> 01:40:23.411
TRAVIS: Sorry. Would you mind helping this fellow
out and giving him a little love?

01:40:23.411 --> 01:40:28.302
TALIESIN: I might do both of you. Hi. It's a
pleasure to meet you. I get the feeling you're

01:40:28.302 --> 01:40:30.024
having a really bad day.

01:40:30.024 --> 01:40:32.021
MARISHA: Oh, jeez. I'll go get Nott.

01:40:32.285 --> 01:40:35.758
TALIESIN: I'm going to do a little healing spell
down here so everyone's feeling a little better.

01:40:35.758 --> 01:40:45.120
I'm going to start doing a little healing on both
of you. Take a few minutes while you

01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:46.349
guys figure this out.

01:40:46.349 --> 01:40:52.779
TRAVIS: Thank you. He rocked me. I miss raging.

01:40:53.057 --> 01:40:56.338
TALIESIN: Prayer of Healing on both of them.

01:40:56.338 --> 01:40:59.361
MATT: Okay, there you go. Nott, Beau catches up to
you on the other ship.

01:40:59.361 --> 01:41:00.758
SAM: Hold!

01:41:00.758 --> 01:41:01.914
MARISHA: Nott!

01:41:01.914 --> 01:41:03.150
SAM: What? What is it?

01:41:03.150 --> 01:41:05.097
MARISHA: Come here.

01:41:06.077 --> 01:41:10.696
SAM: Stand down, men. Are there any men standing
near me?

01:41:10.696 --> 01:41:14.456
MATT: There are two of the other powder monkeys
that are currently playing cards.

01:41:14.456 --> 01:41:19.038
SAM: Stand down. At ease. Wait for my signal.

01:41:19.038 --> 01:41:23.225
TALIESIN: 14 points up for you. 14 points up for
him.

01:41:23.225 --> 01:41:27.588
MARISHA: I think Frumpkin really likes me. We had
a bonding moment. Frumpkin took care of me and

01:41:27.588 --> 01:41:29.159
protected me.

01:41:29.159 --> 01:41:33.155
LIAM: I know that it is true because I think his
thoughts and he thinks mine. We are the best of

01:41:33.155 --> 01:41:36.505
friends. He's the best cat that any man could ever
have.

01:41:36.505 --> 01:41:38.139
MARISHA: Okay, bye. And we go.

01:41:38.139 --> 01:41:41.758
SAM: Where are we going? What's going on? Oh my
gosh. Is Fjord dead?

01:41:41.758 --> 01:41:45.943
MARISHA: No. (whispering) But we found someone and
something.

01:41:45.943 --> 01:41:47.501
SAM: Okay, let's go.

01:41:47.501 --> 01:41:50.675
TRAVIS: While we're waiting for them, can I pick
up his longsword?

01:41:50.675 --> 01:41:51.604
MATT: Yeah.

01:41:51.604 --> 01:41:53.076
TRAVIS: Can I look at it?

01:41:53.076 --> 01:41:54.294
MATT: It's pretty well-made.

01:41:54.294 --> 01:42:01.080
TALIESIN: I still, by the way, have my Detect
Magic up. Am I getting anything?

01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:02.870
MATT: Is Prayer of Healing concentration?

01:42:02.870 --> 01:42:04.538
TALIESIN: So I would have had it when I came in.

01:42:04.538 --> 01:42:06.657
MATT: When you came in? Yeah. The source of magic
was that box.

01:42:06.657 --> 01:42:07.655
TALIESIN: Oh, is that box glowing?

01:42:07.655 --> 01:42:08.709
MATT: Yeah.

01:42:08.709 --> 01:42:13.237
TALIESIN: By the way, I suppose I would have said:
That box is definitely magic. I'd be very careful

01:42:13.237 --> 01:42:18.834
with that. Yeah, let's be gentle with it. Was it
Soma? Mr. Soma?

01:42:18.834 --> 01:42:20.688
MATT: "Soma."

01:42:20.688 --> 01:42:27.005
TALIESIN: How did you get this gig? I was just
curious.

01:42:27.005 --> 01:42:29.195
MATT: "I'm a hired protector."

01:42:29.195 --> 01:42:33.449
TALIESIN: I mean, do you work for anybody or do
you have a deal with somebody? Do you like who you

01:42:33.449 --> 01:42:38.367
work with? Seems kind of a rough gig.

01:42:38.367 --> 01:42:42.788
MATT: "It is when people like you come in here and
ruin it."

01:42:42.788 --> 01:42:49.057
TALIESIN: That's fair. This is just odd. I mean, I
imagine being sent with something I didn't know

01:42:49.057 --> 01:42:55.781
anything about by god-knows-who, that will leave a
mind to wander. I don't know.

01:42:55.781 --> 01:42:59.815
MATT: "You'd be surprised how much of an industry
revolves around just that."

01:42:59.815 --> 01:43:01.765
TALIESIN: Yeah, you know, I would.

01:43:01.765 --> 01:43:07.819
(laughter)

01:43:07.819 --> 01:43:15.814
MATT: He's taken aback even more. "I will say, you
are definitely the strangest pirates I've ever

01:43:15.814 --> 01:43:17.826
"heard of."

01:43:17.826 --> 01:43:21.000
TALIESIN: Sort of a reluctant piracy at the
moment.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:22.583
TRAVIS: You don't know the half of it.

01:43:22.583 --> 01:43:24.601
MARISHA: We like to have fun at our job.

01:43:24.601 --> 01:43:29.074
TALIESIN: We like everybody to walk away feeling
as okay with everything as possible.

01:43:29.074 --> 01:43:37.035
TRAVIS: We're going to let you go now and be on
our way. I'm going to keep this as a memento. I

01:43:37.035 --> 01:43:43.450
would advise you to stay below. If you pop up, I
can't guarantee the same good will be extended.

01:43:43.450 --> 01:43:45.885
I'm sure you understand.

01:43:45.885 --> 01:43:48.328
MATT: He nods begrudgingly.

01:43:48.328 --> 01:43:54.345
MARISHA: Nice plate armor, by the way. (clicks
tongue) It looks expensive.

01:43:54.345 --> 01:44:01.220
MATT: "It was." He looks over at the back part of
it that's been smashed to shit by the ogre's greatclub.

01:44:01.220 --> 01:44:03.544
MARISHA: I toss the box to Nott. Catch!

01:44:03.544 --> 01:44:06.351
SAM: Ah! What is this? What am I doing?

01:44:06.351 --> 01:44:07.972
TRAVIS: Careful with that.

01:44:07.972 --> 01:44:10.047
SAM: What do you want me to do?

01:44:10.047 --> 01:44:11.267
MARISHA: We want you to open it.

01:44:11.267 --> 01:44:12.973
SAM: Me?! Oh, Jesus.

01:44:12.973 --> 01:44:16.044
TRAVIS: Do you want to take this on our ship and
let them be on their way?

01:44:16.044 --> 01:44:19.368
SAM: What if it blows up? I don't want to blow up
our ship. I already did that once today.

01:44:19.368 --> 01:44:21.516
LIAM: (pigeon cooing) Magical traps.

01:44:21.516 --> 01:44:24.082
TALIESIN: Yeah, obviously it is magical, by the
way.

01:44:24.082 --> 01:44:33.249
SAM: All right. Step back. Are there any alcoves
or closets or chests around here or anything?

01:44:33.249 --> 01:44:35.628
MATT: There are a number of crates in the
vicinity.

01:44:35.628 --> 01:44:43.464
SAM: Okay, I'll open a crate and put it inside and
then move back and use Mage Hand to try to open it

01:44:43.464 --> 01:44:46.445
or check for traps with it.

01:44:46.445 --> 01:44:49.127
MATT: Checking for traps, you have to get close
and inspect it.

01:44:49.127 --> 01:44:51.255
SAM: Oh. Well then I will check for traps first.

01:44:51.255 --> 01:44:53.123
MATT: All right, go for it. Make an investigation
check.

01:44:53.123 --> 01:44:55.859
SAM: That is a 20!

01:44:55.859 --> 01:44:58.351
MATT: It is trapped.

01:44:58.351 --> 01:45:01.237
TALIESIN: How trapped is it?

01:45:01.237 --> 01:45:04.166
MATT: It's a fairly complex trap.

01:45:04.166 --> 01:45:05.399
SAM: Mechanical or magical?

01:45:05.399 --> 01:45:07.188
MATT: Mechanical.

01:45:07.188 --> 01:45:10.887
TALIESIN: So is the magic not coming from the box?
Or what was inside the box?

01:45:10.887 --> 01:45:15.338
MATT: You gather it's probably what's inside the
box. You could attempt to disarm.

01:45:15.338 --> 01:45:17.618
SAM: Can I attempt to disarm it with Mage Hand?

01:45:17.618 --> 01:45:19.244
MATT: Yeah, that's what Mage Hand can do.

01:45:19.244 --> 01:45:21.306
SAM: Okay, so back up, everyone.

01:45:21.306 --> 01:45:22.712
TALIESIN: Let's get some distance here.

01:45:22.712 --> 01:45:25.630
SAM: Cover your eyes. Cover your ears.

01:45:25.630 --> 01:45:30.367
TALIESIN: I mean, you got to admit. I bet you're
pretty curious what's in there.

01:45:30.367 --> 01:45:34.268
MATT: As Yasha's still clutching him there, he's
like--

01:45:34.268 --> 01:45:37.485
TALIESIN: Keep everybody okay. I'm going to get a
little distance and I'm going to go outside the

01:45:37.485 --> 01:45:40.421
room, just in case. Mr. Fjord, I would recommend
you get some distance as well.

01:45:40.421 --> 01:45:42.523
TRAVIS: I will take that advice and join you.

01:45:42.523 --> 01:45:49.430
MATT: Make a thieves' tools check, please, with
your dexterity.

01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:52.499
SAM: 28.

01:45:55.298 --> 01:45:59.372
MATT: As the gentle Mage Hand, clutching the
thieves' tools, begins to do this weird ghostly

01:45:59.372 --> 01:46:08.466
finger dance across, you see it go (clicking)
Ting! You hear a spring break. As the Mage Hand

01:46:08.466 --> 01:46:15.446
shockers the box, sure.

01:46:15.446 --> 01:46:18.740
LIAM: (as Nott) Almost got it!

01:46:18.740 --> 01:46:20.285
SAM: One in the pooper!

01:46:20.285 --> 01:46:26.255
(laughter)

01:46:26.255 --> 01:46:31.827
MATT: You hear the spring break on the interior
and it seems the trap has been disabled.

01:46:31.827 --> 01:46:34.642
SAM: I think it worked.

01:46:34.642 --> 01:46:36.572
MARISHA: Fucking open it.

01:46:36.572 --> 01:46:37.842
SAM; Open!

01:46:37.842 --> 01:46:41.383
MATT: That was disabling the trap. Now you have to
open it. Roll to unlock it.

01:46:41.383 --> 01:46:47.386
SAM: Oh, it's still locked. With thieves' tools?
27.

01:46:47.386 --> 01:46:53.898
MATT: There are three locks. There's one lock in
the front, and two on each side. Rapidly, they

01:46:53.898 --> 01:46:55.998
come open.

01:46:55.998 --> 01:46:58.414
SAM: Wow. I want to go look.

01:46:58.414 --> 01:47:04.000
MATT: Okay. You go to open it up and the inside,
it's soft, velvet interior of the case. There you

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:14.354
see a small ceramic pot of some kind, roughly
about that big, that has a lid on it, and it is

01:47:14.354 --> 01:47:21.538
enclosed. Then above it, mashed in there, a
paintbrush. About a foot long.

01:47:21.538 --> 01:47:25.796
SAM: A foot-long paintbrush and a little pot of
paint.

01:47:25.796 --> 01:47:28.565
MATT: A little pot of paint, it looks like.

01:47:28.565 --> 01:47:33.772
SAM: We're not going to touch this. We're going to
take these to our friends who know what to do with it.

01:47:33.772 --> 01:47:40.897
MATT: The guard glances over and goes, "This is
bullshit. This is fucking bullshit."

01:47:40.897 --> 01:47:42.440
MARISHA: What, that you were--

01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:44.617
MATT: "Yes!"

01:47:44.617 --> 01:47:50.930
SAM: You were paid to carry this around? Do you
think it was a prank? Were you pranked by a friend

01:47:50.930 --> 01:47:52.401
of yours or something?

01:47:52.401 --> 01:47:53.787
MATT: "I don't want to talk about it."

01:47:53.787 --> 01:48:02.407
TALIESIN: Mr. Caleb is going to maybe want to take
a look at that later. I would recommend hiding it.

01:48:02.407 --> 01:48:07.234
TRAVIS: In a complete attempt to capitalize on
your disgruntled feelings, would you mind telling

01:48:07.234 --> 01:48:12.204
us who paid you to guard this, or where it came
from? This paintbrush?

01:48:12.204 --> 01:48:19.030
MATT: "I've already given you too much. Let me go
amongst my pride swallowing."

01:48:19.030 --> 01:48:21.998
TALIESIN: I feel really bad about this. Can we
throw him any money or something?

01:48:21.998 --> 01:48:29.863
MARISHA: We already threw him money, which means
you're going to tell us who paid you. Come on,

01:48:29.863 --> 01:48:38.950
man, don't make us do this the hard way. We're
trying to be good. Who paid you?

01:48:40.553 --> 01:48:43.004
MATT: "I don't know."

01:48:43.004 --> 01:48:52.669
MARISHA: (deep breath) Come on. What was the
agency you sub-contracted from? I know how this

01:48:52.669 --> 01:48:53.990
shit works.

01:48:53.990 --> 01:48:58.836
MATT: "I do mercenary work out of Port Damali from
time to time, and other places along the shore.

01:48:58.836 --> 01:49:04.096
"Normally, some of the higher-paying jobs are a
don't-ask-type scenario."

01:49:04.096 --> 01:49:06.130
TRAVIS: Fair enough.

01:49:06.130 --> 01:49:09.309
MARISHA: Thank you.

01:49:09.309 --> 01:49:13.846
TRAVIS: I think we've taken up enough of his time.
You've been more than flexible with our questioning.

01:49:13.846 --> 01:49:16.441
MATT: "That is very true."

01:49:16.441 --> 01:49:20.952
TALIESIN: I think we won't mention to anybody that
we threw you a little cash. I mean, obviously,

01:49:20.952 --> 01:49:26.070
that doesn't need to travel, and, you know,
whatever you need to do to maintain. I understand

01:49:26.070 --> 01:49:28.068
dignity is a thing.

01:49:28.068 --> 01:49:32.959
MARISHA: As well as the fact that you spit in my
face. I'm going to leave that here. We're going to

01:49:32.959 --> 01:49:35.882
cross out these doors. None of it happened.

01:49:35.882 --> 01:49:41.380
TALIESIN: Actually, if you like, we can walk out
of here being very irritated, like: Ugh! That guy.

01:49:41.380 --> 01:49:42.674
Too much.

01:49:42.674 --> 01:49:46.491
MARISHA: Oh, yeah! Do you want us to do that?
Like: Ooh! Ah! You got me in my kidney!

01:49:46.491 --> 01:49:49.587
MATT: He's just giving the thousand-yard stare
into a shadowy corner.

01:49:49.587 --> 01:49:54.880
TRAVIS: I actually do feel that way, so let's just
head up. We'll head up above.

01:49:54.880 --> 01:50:00.888
MATT: All right. Bouldergut stops and turns around
toward him and pats him on the head, and then

01:50:00.888 --> 01:50:03.586
follows up behind you guys.

01:50:03.586 --> 01:50:08.123
TALIESIN: I feel like we should leave these people
with most of what we-- I think this has been

01:50:08.123 --> 01:50:12.090
enough. I don't want to, you know, cause any more
trouble than we have.

01:50:12.090 --> 01:50:14.708
TRAVIS: I agree. Do you want to make sure
everyone's feeling all right before we--

01:50:14.708 --> 01:50:17.372
TALIESIN: Anyone else need some healing? Anything
real quick?

01:50:17.372 --> 01:50:25.394
MATT: Captain Jules Errog says, "No! Would you
please leave us, if you have everything you need?"

01:50:25.394 --> 01:50:29.549
LAURA: Lieb! Get back over to your ship! You're
going to miss it!

01:50:29.549 --> 01:50:30.771
MATT: (panting and whimpering)

01:50:30.771 --> 01:50:31.924
LAURA: Go go go!

01:50:31.924 --> 01:50:32.918
TRAVIS: Jester, what are you doing?

01:50:32.918 --> 01:50:34.277
LAURA: Oh, nothing!

01:50:34.277 --> 01:50:36.929
MATT: He runs back across like, (panting).

01:50:36.929 --> 01:50:38.880
LAURA: I made a friend!

01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:45.949
TRAVIS: Can I reach over and-- Come here. I pull
his shirt aside. Did you do this?

01:50:45.949 --> 01:50:47.409
LAURA: He has been marked!

01:50:47.409 --> 01:50:53.697
MATT: (laughter) (whimpering)

01:50:53.697 --> 01:50:55.548
MARISHA: That's rare.

01:50:55.548 --> 01:51:02.185
TRAVIS: Thank you for your hospitality. I am glad
that we could complete this transaction peacefully.

01:51:02.185 --> 01:51:09.154
MATT: The captain gives a nod. "Thank you for
sparing the lives of my men."

01:51:09.154 --> 01:51:14.794
TRAVIS: I wish you calm waters and safe journey.
We will take it back over to The Squalleater.

01:51:14.794 --> 01:51:20.768
MARISHA: As we're walking over, I whisper to Fjord
and I say: Avantika's going to want the paintbrush.

01:51:20.768 --> 01:51:23.355
TRAVIS: What?

01:51:23.355 --> 01:51:27.397
MARISHA: Avantika's going to want to know about
that paintbrush.

01:51:27.397 --> 01:51:31.209
TRAVIS: Not yet.

01:51:31.209 --> 01:51:36.253
MATT: As you guys come across, the rest of
Avantika's crew pulls over the gangplanks. They

01:51:36.253 --> 01:51:44.604
pull up anchor. Avantika, looking over the
opposite side, goes, "Do not pull up your anchor

01:51:44.604 --> 01:51:53.209
"until we are beyond your sight. if we see you
shift beforehand, we will turn right back around."

01:51:53.209 --> 01:52:01.951
The other crew nods. Sails unfurl. Wind picks up.
Ship begins to move. You begin continuing to head

01:52:01.951 --> 01:52:09.669
westward. Once you're a little bit out of earshot
and Avantika's keeping an eye off the edge of the

01:52:09.669 --> 01:52:16.380
ship, looks back to the rest of you and (slow
clapping). The rest of the crew begins to clap and

01:52:16.380 --> 01:52:28.627
there's a bit of applause. "With that, my friends,
welcome, truly, to what it means to be free on the

01:52:28.627 --> 01:52:37.705
"sea. I'm proud of you. So! Let's see what you
found." They go to start opening the chest, and

01:52:37.705 --> 01:52:41.381
we'll take a break there.

01:52:41.381 --> 01:52:45.607
SAM: Boysie. I'm hiding the little pot-thing, by
the way.

01:52:45.607 --> 01:52:47.629
MARISHA: Yeah, but Bouldergut was there.

01:52:47.629 --> 01:52:49.467
SAM: Yeah, that's true.

01:52:49.467 --> 01:52:55.648
MARISHA: Bouldergut saw everything, so unless we
want to bribe Bouldergut--

01:52:56.137 --> 01:52:58.253
MATT: We'll get to that when we come back from the
break!

01:52:58.253 --> 01:53:00.023
MARISHA: I have to pee, too.

01:53:00.023 --> 01:53:02.576
TALIESIN: I know. I'm dying.

01:53:02.576 --> 01:53:06.349
MATT: We'll be back here in just a moment. In the
meantime, we do have our Wyrmwood giveaway for the

01:53:06.349 --> 01:53:10.759
evening. For this, you need to head over to the
Critical Role Twitch chat, that's

01:53:10.759 --> 01:53:19.973
twitch.tv/criticalrole, to enter. Tonight's
keyword is reef. R-E-E-F. Enter it once. More than

01:53:19.973 --> 01:53:24.271
once, you'll be disqualified. Once again, this is

01:53:24.271 --> 01:53:30.438
excluding Quebec. Tonight we have our fantastic
figured myrtlewood dice vault, which is a new wood

01:53:30.438 --> 01:53:36.488
offered by Wyrmwood, which has actually really
cool texture to it. It's got a weird shimmer. It's

01:53:36.488 --> 01:53:44.380
quite pretty and one of you is going to win that
when we return! Enter in the Twitch chat and we'll

01:53:44.380 --> 01:53:47.100
see you guys here in a few minutes.

01:53:48.465 --> 02:13:44.929
[break]

02:13:44.929 --> 02:13:52.294
MATT: Welcome back, everyone. The winner of our
fantastic figured myrtlewood dice vault.

02:13:52.294 --> 02:13:53.726
TRAVIS: Myrtle!

02:13:53.726 --> 02:14:00.605
MATT: Myrtlewood! It's really pretty. Ironically,
well-named CaptainCupcake!

02:14:00.605 --> 02:14:02.829
(cheering)

02:14:02.829 --> 02:14:04.891
MATT: Congratulations, CaptainCupcake!

02:14:04.891 --> 02:14:06.070
MARISHA: That's so cute.

02:14:06.070 --> 02:14:09.187
MATT: (pirate voice) We'll get that sent to you
right rickety-split.

02:14:09.187 --> 02:14:11.054
LIAM: (parrot voice) Captain Cupcake!

02:14:11.054 --> 02:14:19.221
TALIESIN: (parrot voice) Captain Cupcake!
(realistic cawing) Sorry, too much! Reeling it in.

02:14:19.221 --> 02:14:27.305
MATT: Having now made your way on the Squalleater
from, as far as I know, all of you, your first

02:14:27.305 --> 02:14:35.966
real bit of piracy. Pulling away, the chest that
was brought on-board is currently being picked and

02:14:35.966 --> 02:14:42.599
opened by some members of the crew. (thudding) As
it folds open, looking inside, you can see it is a

02:14:42.599 --> 02:14:51.602
mass of gold, silver, copper, and an occasional
glimmer of platinum coins. This is quite a bit of

02:14:51.602 --> 02:15:01.402
change. At which point, the captain looks over to
the quartermaster and goes, "Well done. This will

02:15:01.402 --> 02:15:07.141
be divvied up appropriately. What else was found?
We've got some--" and then begin to point out the

02:15:07.141 --> 02:15:14.335
food, the thawing tropical fruit that was placed
there.

02:15:14.335 --> 02:15:16.883
MARISHA: Where's Bouldergut to me?

02:15:16.883 --> 02:15:22.970
MATT: Bouldergut's sitting there with the rest of
you, looking around and listening to the captain,

02:15:22.970 --> 02:15:25.375
looking off into the distance. Maybe ten feet from
you.

02:15:25.375 --> 02:15:26.646
MARISHA: Okay.

02:15:31.850 --> 02:15:41.067
SAM: (stilted) I have to go check on the cannons
downstairs. I'll be back later.

02:15:41.067 --> 02:15:43.364
TALIESIN: Wow.

02:15:43.364 --> 02:15:48.337
MATT: Make a deception check.

02:15:48.337 --> 02:15:53.808
SAM: Minus three. Ten.

02:15:53.808 --> 02:15:56.267
LIAM: I rolled a 12 on insight.

02:15:56.267 --> 02:16:02.679
MATT: The captain glances past and goes, "Eh, why
don't you stay here, at least until we're finished

02:16:02.679 --> 02:16:04.599
divvying up all the findings."

02:16:04.599 --> 02:16:09.373
SAM: Of course, Captain. I am at your
beck-and-call.

02:16:09.373 --> 02:16:11.490
TALIESIN: So weird.

02:16:11.490 --> 02:16:16.567
MATT: "You're telling me. All right, anything
else? What transpired below? You have not told me

02:16:16.567 --> 02:16:21.375
what happened. Apparently, there was some sort of
a scuffle?" and Bouldergut goes, "(deep chuckle)

02:16:21.375 --> 02:16:31.367
Yeah. Tiny man in armor." You begin to realize, at
this point, not a whole lot of timbre difference

02:16:31.367 --> 02:16:36.232
between the male and female ogres that you have
encountered in your time. It's generally just more

02:16:36.232 --> 02:16:40.061
hair on the top of the head-- stubble's about the
same.

02:16:40.061 --> 02:16:45.938
TRAVIS: Indeed, there was a man in full plate
armor who got quite a few shots in.

02:16:45.938 --> 02:16:50.579
MARISHA: One less pirate and one less shipper
trying to prove himself a hero. Thought he could

02:16:50.579 --> 02:16:55.060
stand up to the lot of us.

02:16:55.060 --> 02:16:58.215
MATT: "That is impressive. Did you finish him
off?"

02:16:58.215 --> 02:17:03.758
MARISHA: Well, we didn't kill him, but we
definitely embarrassed him thoroughly, something

02:17:03.798 --> 02:17:08.517
that I find some men find worse than death.

02:17:08.517 --> 02:17:20.576
MATT: "I'm impressed, you are all very strongly
adhering to this not-killing aspect of piracy. I

02:17:20.576 --> 02:17:32.466
can tell you from experience, it does not last
very long, but I respect the intent. Anything else?"

02:17:32.484 --> 02:17:38.785
MARISHA: I heard there were some very good
tropical fruits, super rare, in this crate. Based

02:17:38.785 --> 02:17:44.066
on what I found, (clicks). Good meal later on.

02:17:44.066 --> 02:17:45.725
TALIESIN: Did we keep the sword? I don't
remember.

02:17:45.725 --> 02:17:52.373
TRAVIS: We did, yes. I kept a memento. I hold up
the longsword.

02:17:52.373 --> 02:17:59.340
MATT: She looks at you, "Hmm, not bad." Bouldergut
leans in, right over your shoulder, Beau, and

02:17:59.340 --> 02:18:03.203
goes, "What's the--"

02:18:03.203 --> 02:18:07.742
MARISHA: I slip her 30 gold.

02:18:07.742 --> 02:18:11.386
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check.

02:18:11.386 --> 02:18:14.442
SAM: Bribing the crew in front of the captain.

02:18:14.442 --> 02:18:24.132
MARISHA: I'm not-- I'm trying to-- Oh my god, are
you serious?

02:18:24.132 --> 02:18:25.401
LIAM: It's a seven.

02:18:25.401 --> 02:18:26.382
MARISHA: Oh, is it?

02:18:26.382 --> 02:18:27.266
LIAM: Yeah, it's a seven.

02:18:27.266 --> 02:18:27.926
MARISHA: That's still not great.

02:18:27.926 --> 02:18:28.809
LIAM: No.

02:18:28.809 --> 02:18:29.272
TRAVIS: That's a one.

02:18:29.272 --> 02:18:31.456
MARISHA: That brings me to an 11?

02:18:31.456 --> 02:18:32.435
LAURA: Is it a one or a seven?

02:18:32.435 --> 02:18:33.053
TRAVIS: That's a one.

02:18:33.053 --> 02:18:33.691
LIAM: Oh, it is a one!

02:18:33.691 --> 02:18:36.373
MARISHA: It is a one? Nope, it's a one!

02:18:36.373 --> 02:18:37.644
SAM: Clang, clang-clang.

02:18:37.644 --> 02:18:43.054
MATT: As you reach back, your coins slip from your
grasp, and (clattering coins) all across--

02:18:43.054 --> 02:18:47.672
MARISHA: Fucking hole in my pouch. Shit, how did
that--

02:18:47.672 --> 02:18:53.223
MATT: Bouldergut goes (grunts) and starts helping
you pick them up, but fumbling with her giant fingers.

02:18:53.234 --> 02:19:04.976
MARISHA: Thank you. Good show everybody, everybody
great time. Just wanted a round of applause.

02:19:04.976 --> 02:19:06.730
LAURA: (cheering)

02:19:06.730 --> 02:19:07.794
MARISHA: Captain Tusktooth!

02:19:07.794 --> 02:19:09.383
LAURA: Go Captain Tusktooth!

02:19:09.383 --> 02:19:20.526
MARISHA: Sorry. Quartermaster Tusktooth, formerly
captain for us.

02:19:20.526 --> 02:19:21.533
MATT: "Indeed."

02:19:21.533 --> 02:19:24.022
MARISHA: Anyway, it was a good day.

02:19:24.022 --> 02:19:27.214
TALIESIN: Start doing a little more healing on
you.

02:19:27.214 --> 02:19:32.776
MATT: Avantika gives a keen look towards Beau,
nods.

02:19:32.776 --> 02:19:34.254
LAURA: Captain Avantika?

02:19:34.254 --> 02:19:35.324
MATT: "Yes, Jester?"

02:19:35.324 --> 02:19:37.293
LAURA: Would you like a tattoo?

02:19:37.293 --> 02:19:41.054
MATT: "I already have plenty, but thank you, I
appreciate the offer."

02:19:41.054 --> 02:19:46.479
LAURA: If you want any more, or if you want any of
the ones you have improved, just let me know.

02:19:46.479 --> 02:19:54.646
MATT: "I will keep that under consideration.
Anyway, regardless, well done. Impressive work.

02:19:54.646 --> 02:20:00.086
"Let's continue on to the Dragshallow Reefs. Come
on."

02:20:01.964 --> 02:20:03.514
SAM: (running feet pattering)

02:20:03.514 --> 02:20:09.793
LAURA: What are you hiding? I chase after Nott.

02:20:09.793 --> 02:20:12.404
MATT: You catch up to Nott. Are you going as well,
or is it just you two?

02:20:12.404 --> 02:20:13.245
SAM: I'm going downstairs.

02:20:13.277 --> 02:20:14.739
MARISHA: What are people doing?

02:20:14.739 --> 02:20:15.997
MATT: That's what I'm asking: what are people
doing?

02:20:15.997 --> 02:20:17.146
MARISHA: We act casual.

02:20:17.146 --> 02:20:20.697
TRAVIS: I stay up to entertain Avantika.

02:20:20.697 --> 02:20:39.428
MARISHA: I, sensing my biff, casually I turn to
Ipess and say: Hey man, great work down there. How

02:20:39.428 --> 02:20:40.550
great was that?

02:20:40.550 --> 02:20:42.386
MATT: "You as well. It was very impressive."

02:20:42.386 --> 02:20:43.520
MARISHA: So impressive, right?

02:20:43.520 --> 02:20:44.687
MATT: "You beat the shit out of that man."

02:20:44.687 --> 02:20:48.697
MARISHA: I fucking-- right? Saw that adrenaline
pumping.

02:20:48.697 --> 02:20:50.854
MATT: "I could tell that. It was very nice, well
done."

02:20:50.854 --> 02:20:52.965
MARISHA: Anyway, good day, man. I go downstairs.

02:20:52.965 --> 02:20:54.652
MATT: "You too. Goodbye."

02:20:54.652 --> 02:21:05.916
TALIESIN: I'm going to head down, obviously tired,
and just go follow you guys to take a nap.

02:21:05.916 --> 02:21:07.485
MATT: Anyone else doing anything?

02:21:07.485 --> 02:21:10.380
LAURA: I'm following Nott.

02:21:10.414 --> 02:21:11.953
MARISHA: I'm trailing them.

02:21:11.953 --> 02:21:15.780
TRAVIS: Bring that fucking wizard down here with
you.

02:21:15.780 --> 02:21:20.383
MARISHA: I try to find Caleb. They do that.

02:21:20.383 --> 02:21:23.230
MATT: Okay, you find Caleb. Caleb, if you haven't
left the top of the deck--

02:21:23.230 --> 02:21:27.244
LIAM: No, I've been exactly where I was. Do you
want to know more about my cat? Because you walked

02:21:27.244 --> 02:21:33.210
off before. The funny thing about a cat is that
they are very persnickety but with the right

02:21:33.210 --> 02:21:38.659
person, they are not. Frumpkin with me, we are
just so.

02:21:38.659 --> 02:21:45.831
MARISHA: Genuine question: have you been telling
this story the entire time I've been gone?

02:21:45.831 --> 02:21:49.642
LIAM: No, that would be-- I'm a very intelligent
person. That would be foolish. I don't talk to

02:21:49.642 --> 02:21:56.372
thin air. Also, some people say that they have
nine lives, which is funny, because we--

02:21:56.372 --> 02:22:00.835
MARISHA: That's great. You know what? I have
something I think that you would be deeply

02:22:00.835 --> 02:22:02.352
interested in, maybe.

02:22:02.352 --> 02:22:03.710
LIAM: Did you find books?

02:22:03.710 --> 02:22:07.072
MARISHA: I didn't. Fucking, goddamn it.

02:22:07.072 --> 02:22:09.022
TRAVIS: I forgot to look too. I did too.

02:22:09.022 --> 02:22:11.631
MARISHA: I didn't find fucking books.

02:22:11.631 --> 02:22:13.687
LIAM: It's a long shot. We are on the--

02:22:13.687 --> 02:22:24.899
MARISHA: Okay, books, cats, I get it, that's so
good. Love your fascination of both the most

02:22:24.899 --> 02:22:32.761
boring things that I can think about, including
books and cats. But let's go look

02:22:32.761 --> 02:22:35.706
at something awesome.

02:22:35.715 --> 02:22:38.186
LIAM: You thought it too, didn't you?

02:22:38.186 --> 02:22:43.675
LIAM, MARISHA, and MATT: (singing) Books and cats
and books and cats and books and cats...

02:22:43.675 --> 02:22:48.445
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>. You're telling me your love of higher
learning, I understand. Did you need something?

02:22:48.445 --> 02:22:56.547
Because you clearly don't want to hear about cats,
so we could end this now.

02:22:56.547 --> 02:23:03.185
MARISHA: Just keep your mouth shut for like 30
damn seconds.

02:23:03.185 --> 02:23:04.657
LAURA: What'd you find?

02:23:04.657 --> 02:23:05.476
MARISHA: Follow me.

02:23:05.476 --> 02:23:06.777
LAURA: What'd you find?

02:23:06.777 --> 02:23:08.757
MARISHA: We bring him to them.

02:23:08.757 --> 02:23:11.684
LAURA: What'd you find? What was it? What are you
hiding? I want to know!

02:23:11.684 --> 02:23:14.258
SAM: Where are we? Let's get into our rooms. We're
going to go into our cabins.

02:23:14.258 --> 02:23:17.908
MATT: All right, you go to your chambers.

02:23:17.908 --> 02:23:19.508
SAM and MARISHA: Hi.

02:23:19.508 --> 02:23:21.689
LAURA: Oh, hi! Nott's hiding something.

02:23:21.689 --> 02:23:25.786
TALIESIN: I'm keeping a close eye on what's going
on, this is very-- they're being so sketchy.

02:23:25.786 --> 02:23:28.026
MATT: Yasha pulls in, "What is going on?"

02:23:28.026 --> 02:23:31.686
MARISHA: Shh, come in, shut up. Did anyone follow
you?

02:23:31.686 --> 02:23:33.457
MATT: "No."

02:23:33.482 --> 02:23:37.526
SAM: The captain can be invisible. She might be in
this room with us right now.

02:23:37.526 --> 02:23:39.188
LAURA: (gasping) Let's all walk around, walk
around the whole room.

02:23:39.188 --> 02:23:43.168
SAM: Just do this.

02:23:43.168 --> 02:23:46.036
LAURA: Oh, that's you. That's you, Nott. Okay,
hi.

02:23:46.036 --> 02:23:47.444
TALIESIN: (laughter) That tickles.

02:23:47.444 --> 02:23:48.154
SAM: Do we feel anything?

02:23:48.154 --> 02:23:51.485
MATT: No.

02:23:51.499 --> 02:23:54.878
LIAM: That would have been so awesome.

02:23:54.878 --> 02:23:58.415
TRAVIS: (impact) (gasping)

02:23:58.415 --> 02:24:00.395
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Shank shank shank!

02:24:00.395 --> 02:24:02.646
(laughter)

02:24:02.646 --> 02:24:06.245
MARISHA: (wailing)

02:24:06.245 --> 02:24:10.610
SAM: Here's what I got! It's a magical
paintbrush!

02:24:10.610 --> 02:24:12.807
MARISHA: Do the thing. Figure it out.

02:24:12.807 --> 02:24:13.687
SAM: Identify it.

02:24:13.687 --> 02:24:15.000
LAURA: (gasps) Should I draw with it? Should I do
something with it?

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.316
SAM: Not yet.

02:24:17.316 --> 02:24:20.025
LIAM: I can talk now? Okay.

02:24:20.025 --> 02:24:22.294
MARISHA: Yes. Just not about cats and books.

02:24:22.294 --> 02:24:23.485
LAURA: What is it?

02:24:23.485 --> 02:24:27.796
LIAM: I will still help you. I need a moment, so I
set it down and start scrawling on the floor

02:24:27.796 --> 02:24:30.184
around it, and about ten minutes later I have--

02:24:30.184 --> 02:24:35.485
MARISHA: In the meantime, I'm like: Oh my god! So,
what happened? Is it like a tattoo?

02:24:35.485 --> 02:24:37.968
LAURA: Yeah! It was amazing!

02:24:37.968 --> 02:24:40.135
MARISHA: When are you going to do a tattoo on me?

02:24:40.135 --> 02:24:42.145
MATT: The full box? Are you inspecting the full
box?

02:24:42.145 --> 02:24:48.423
LIAM: No, because-- well, I guess I wasn't there.
No, I mean, if they put the box down in front of me.

02:24:48.451 --> 02:24:53.675
MARISHA: I opened the box. This is the paintbrush
and the ink.

02:24:53.675 --> 02:24:55.898
SAM: Is it a big box?

02:24:55.898 --> 02:24:57.424
MATT: The box is about shoebox size.

02:24:57.424 --> 02:25:00.292
SAM: But it's the size of the item contained
within.

02:25:00.292 --> 02:25:01.203
MATT: Correct, yeah.

02:25:01.203 --> 02:25:02.036
SAM: It's not giant or anything.

02:25:02.036 --> 02:25:03.253
MATT: No.

02:25:03.253 --> 02:25:05.125
MARISHA: Caduceus detected magic, and it was
glowy.

02:25:05.125 --> 02:25:06.724
LIAM: That's a lucky find.

02:25:06.724 --> 02:25:09.113
MARISHA: That's what I'm saying, so I need to
figure out what it is.

02:25:09.113 --> 02:25:13.623
LIAM: You, shush, now, give me a moment.
(mechanical noises) Ten minutes later, after I

02:25:13.623 --> 02:25:21.803
transform into an Autobot, I cast Identify through
the ritual spellcasting feat.

02:25:21.803 --> 02:25:23.581
(gasping)

02:25:23.581 --> 02:25:25.642
TRAVIS: Ooh, that's a big old thing!

02:25:25.642 --> 02:25:27.519
TALIESIN: That's a novel.

02:25:27.519 --> 02:25:28.723
LAURA: What is it, Caleb?

02:25:28.723 --> 02:25:31.538
LIAM: I need time. It's a long piece of paper. It's a
lot of knowledge.

02:25:31.552 --> 02:25:32.751
SAM: Long spell.

02:25:32.751 --> 02:25:34.812
LIAM: So you talk amongst yourselves for one
minute.

02:25:34.812 --> 02:25:36.487
LAURA: What do you want a tattoo of?

02:25:36.487 --> 02:25:39.619
SAM: What do you think it-- Oh, a tattoo, if we
could pick any tattoo?

02:25:39.619 --> 02:25:40.757
TRAVIS: Trecorum Satis Dee?

02:25:40.757 --> 02:25:42.287
TALIESIN: Trecorum Satis Dee. You're welcome.

02:25:42.287 --> 02:25:46.906
SAM: You mean, what physical attribute would we
increase, or what would you want the tattoo to be

02:25:46.906 --> 02:25:48.367
a picture of?

02:25:48.367 --> 02:25:51.639
LAURA: Yeah, no, what do you want a tattoo of,
like a picture of.

02:25:51.639 --> 02:25:52.960
MARISHA: I've had an idea.

02:25:52.960 --> 02:25:53.808
LAURA: What is it?

02:25:53.808 --> 02:25:59.638
MARISHA: For just a little bit. So this is going
to be stupid.

02:25:59.638 --> 02:26:01.486
TRAVIS: Probably.

02:26:01.486 --> 02:26:03.421
MARISHA: You're not, fucking--

02:26:03.421 --> 02:26:05.021
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) Not there!

02:26:05.021 --> 02:26:08.509
(laughter)

02:26:08.509 --> 02:26:12.556
MARISHA: The Not There Fairy? Not there!

02:26:12.556 --> 02:26:14.741
TRAVIS: Flying away!

02:26:14.741 --> 02:26:16.342
TALIESIN: (singing) Not there.

02:26:16.342 --> 02:26:21.540
MATT: Cousin of the Metagaming Pigeon, the Not
There Imp. Not There Fairy, there you go. Don't

02:26:21.540 --> 02:26:24.820
forget, Nott, you still have that marble, silver
shield thing.

02:26:24.820 --> 02:26:26.430
SAM: Yeah, can he do more than one Identify at a
time?

02:26:26.430 --> 02:26:28.365
MATT: You can take time to do it a few times.

02:26:28.365 --> 02:26:30.496
LIAM: It's endless, but it takes ten minutes.

02:26:30.496 --> 02:26:31.690
SAM: Oh. You mean, the shield?

02:26:31.690 --> 02:26:32.860
MATT: The shield, yeah.

02:26:32.860 --> 02:26:34.109
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck yeah.

02:26:34.109 --> 02:26:35.528
LAURA: What?

02:26:35.528 --> 02:26:44.480
MARISHA: I have this idea, because Molly, on the
back of his coat, his neck, his tattoo?

02:26:44.480 --> 02:26:46.718
TALIESIN: He had it in the tattoo and the coat,
yeah.

02:26:46.718 --> 02:26:51.690
MARISHA: On the back of his tattoo, he had an
all-seeing eye, and I just, I don't know, I

02:26:51.690 --> 02:27:00.185
thought it was really cool, I feel like it could
be cool to have it on my back, right below my neck.

02:27:00.201 --> 02:27:01.625
LAURA: I think Molly would like that.

02:27:01.625 --> 02:27:02.466
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:27:02.466 --> 02:27:05.298
LAURA: I mean, I don't know, maybe it was really
sacred to him and he would be really super

02:27:05.298 --> 02:27:06.430
offended by it.

02:27:06.430 --> 02:27:07.927
MARISHA: Oh, yeah, maybe it would, like I stole it
from him?

02:27:07.927 --> 02:27:09.065
LAURA: But it's fine, I'm sure.

02:27:09.065 --> 02:27:11.612
MARISHA: Yeah, you know, he's dead, so, what's he
going to do?

02:27:11.612 --> 02:27:14.926
ALL: Wow.

02:27:14.926 --> 02:27:17.446
TALIESIN: I was about to say, you can roll a d20
and if you roll a 20 I'll tell you what Molly

02:27:17.446 --> 02:27:20.935
would have thought.

02:27:20.935 --> 02:27:23.526
MARISHA: We'll do that later.

02:27:23.526 --> 02:27:25.805
SAM: Any news, Caleb?

02:27:25.805 --> 02:27:26.985
LAURA: What is it?

02:27:26.985 --> 02:27:28.558
LIAM: Sit down.

02:27:28.558 --> 02:27:32.315
LAURA: Okay, okay!

02:27:32.315 --> 02:27:37.765
LIAM: This is your lucky day. This is very
dangerous to give to you, but you are the perfect

02:27:37.765 --> 02:27:44.417
person to have it, so of course, well, here it is,
it is yours. This will allow you to paint things

02:27:44.417 --> 02:27:47.107
and they become <i>real</i>.

02:27:47.107 --> 02:27:50.266
MARISHA: Yes! I was so hoping for this!

02:27:50.266 --> 02:27:51.336
TRAVIS: What do you mean?

02:27:51.336 --> 02:27:53.247
SAM: Anything?

02:27:53.247 --> 02:27:57.297
LIAM: Almost anything. Nothing too fancy.

02:27:57.297 --> 02:28:01.155
MARISHA: Isn't that an old Chinese folklore, a
magic paintbrush?

02:28:01.155 --> 02:28:02.936
TALIESIN: This is some Bugs Bunny shit.

02:28:02.936 --> 02:28:06.382
MARISHA: It's the magic paintbrush.

02:28:06.382 --> 02:28:08.690
TRAVIS: Like the "Who Framed Roger Rabbit"
warehouse?

02:28:08.726 --> 02:28:09.525
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

02:28:09.525 --> 02:28:11.125
TRAVIS: Singing sword, and black hole?

02:28:11.125 --> 02:28:15.949
LIAM: This will allow her to paint a door and
there to be a door. This will allow her to paint

02:28:16.082 --> 02:28:18.339
a sword and there will be a sword.

02:28:18.339 --> 02:28:19.490
TRAVIS: What?

02:28:19.490 --> 02:28:20.764
LIAM: All you can eat, Fjord.

02:28:20.764 --> 02:28:21.899
SAM: Wait.

02:28:21.899 --> 02:28:23.421
MATT: It does eventually use up the paint over
time.

02:28:23.421 --> 02:28:28.064
LAURA: It can do a thousand square feet of
surface? I mean, I learn from you in a moment?

02:28:28.064 --> 02:28:29.870
LIAM: I explain it all in about a minute.

02:28:29.870 --> 02:28:32.139
SAM: When you walk down an alley and paint
dicks--

02:28:32.139 --> 02:28:34.079
SAM and MARISHA: There'll be real dicks!

02:28:34.079 --> 02:28:35.668
LAURA: (yelling)

02:28:35.668 --> 02:28:38.641
SAM: Just dicks everywhere, dicks and dicks!

02:28:38.641 --> 02:28:39.730
TRAVIS: Dicks hanging out the walls.

02:28:39.730 --> 02:28:41.122
MATT: (laughter) I didn't think this through!

02:28:41.122 --> 02:28:42.780
TRAVIS: (laughter) "I didn't think this through?"

02:28:42.780 --> 02:28:44.190
SAM: Just a wall full of dicks!

02:28:44.190 --> 02:28:48.341
TALIESIN: How did you not think this through? This
was inevitably where this was going.

02:28:48.341 --> 02:28:50.458
MATT: No, in hindsight, it occurs to me.

02:28:50.458 --> 02:28:52.999
SAM: If someone falls asleep, you could paint a
dick on their head, and they'll have a dick on

02:28:52.999 --> 02:28:53.810
their head!

02:28:53.810 --> 02:28:54.750
LAURA: (shouting) Oh my god!

02:28:54.848 --> 02:28:56.170
SAM: (yelling)

02:28:56.170 --> 02:28:58.596
LAURA: This is my favorite thing in the entire
universe.

02:28:58.596 --> 02:29:01.400
TRAVIS: (newscaster voice) A rash of wild dicks
have appeared in Wildemount and through the

02:29:01.400 --> 02:29:10.320
Dwendalian Empire. No one can explain the huge
dongs protruding from walls, sculptures, and holy places.

02:29:10.358 --> 02:29:14.040
LAURA: This is the most amazing thing in the
entire universe.

02:29:14.040 --> 02:29:15.565
TALIESIN: Fields of phalli.

02:29:15.565 --> 02:29:19.122
LAURA: I won't lose it, I won't! Caleb!

02:29:19.122 --> 02:29:23.625
LIAM: So just don't create a penis on my head,
okay? And we're square.

02:29:23.625 --> 02:29:29.254
LAURA: I promise I will not draw a penis on your
head.

02:29:29.254 --> 02:29:32.132
LIAM: Excellent.

02:29:32.132 --> 02:29:34.162
SAM: Can it make living things?

02:29:34.162 --> 02:29:35.761
TRAVIS: A finite amount of ink, or what?

02:29:35.761 --> 02:29:37.142
LIAM: No, it cannot do that.

02:29:37.142 --> 02:29:38.062
SAM: Not living things.

02:29:38.062 --> 02:29:39.295
LAURA: Inanimate.

02:29:39.295 --> 02:29:42.041
LIAM: It cannot create fabulous jewels, and it
cannot create piles of gold.

02:29:42.041 --> 02:29:43.540
MARISHA: Haha, dick joke.

02:29:43.540 --> 02:29:47.722
LAURA: But it can get us an escape from somewhere,
it can--

02:29:47.722 --> 02:29:53.953
SAM: If we wanted to spirit ourselves away from
this boat in the middle of the night, she could

02:29:53.953 --> 02:29:55.911
paint us a boat.

02:29:55.911 --> 02:29:58.371
MATT: She would need a surface to paint it on.

02:29:58.371 --> 02:30:00.902
SAM: Oh. Paper?

02:30:00.902 --> 02:30:03.423
TALIESIN: It would be a really big-- you would
have a tiny boat.

02:30:03.423 --> 02:30:07.509
SAM: Not a ship, I'm talking about a raft, she
could just paint a little raft and we could (boop).

02:30:07.889 --> 02:30:09.015
TALIESIN: Then we'd be a raft in the ocean.

02:30:09.015 --> 02:30:12.236
LIAM: You could, in theory, paint a small boat on
the deck of the ship if no one was watching, but

02:30:12.236 --> 02:30:14.142
that would be a difficult thing to do.

02:30:14.142 --> 02:30:15.620
TALIESIN: That would take a long time, though.

02:30:15.620 --> 02:30:19.270
MARISHA: This is a real conversation we actually
need to have, with the entire group present,

02:30:19.270 --> 02:30:20.053
speaking of.

02:30:20.053 --> 02:30:22.099
SAM: We're here.

02:30:22.099 --> 02:30:24.125
MARISHA: Except for Fjord.

02:30:24.125 --> 02:30:25.484
SAM: Oh, Fjord.

02:30:25.484 --> 02:30:29.097
TALIESIN: We're heading to port regardless. I
figure at some point--

02:30:29.097 --> 02:30:32.404
MARISHA: Yeah, I feel like before port. We need a
plan before port.

02:30:32.404 --> 02:30:34.015
TRAVIS: Before port.

02:30:34.015 --> 02:30:41.276
LAURA: Oh my god, this is the most amazing thing
in the <i>entire</i> universe.

02:30:41.276 --> 02:30:44.572
TALIESIN: I figure things don't change regardless,
as long as we're on the ocean.

02:30:44.572 --> 02:30:48.632
TRAVIS: Before port (snaps fingers).

02:30:50.842 --> 02:30:59.197
MATT: You only had to actually be pirates and
fucking roll a ship to get it, so live with that.

02:31:00.909 --> 02:31:03.066
LAURA: I'm okay, I can live with that.

02:31:03.066 --> 02:31:05.821
TRAVIS: Does it say how much paint it comes with?

02:31:05.821 --> 02:31:08.531
LAURA: It comes with enough to cover a thousand
square feet of surface.

02:31:08.531 --> 02:31:09.368
TRAVIS: Wow, okay.

02:31:09.368 --> 02:31:11.673
MARISHA: I don't want to waste that.

02:31:11.673 --> 02:31:13.669
LAURA: So if I made a ship then it would use a lot
of it.

02:31:13.669 --> 02:31:15.723
MARISHA: We could just steal a ship.

02:31:15.723 --> 02:31:18.745
LAURA: But I mean, lots of things that are little,
oh my god.

02:31:18.745 --> 02:31:21.383
SAM: Or one pretty nice-size apartment.

02:31:21.383 --> 02:31:25.259
LAURA: Just think about how many dicks that is! If
it's like a five-inch dick, that's like 2000 dicks.

02:31:25.259 --> 02:31:27.564
TRAVIS: What if you painted a 500-pound diamond?

02:31:27.564 --> 02:31:28.867
LAURA: No, you can't do that.

02:31:28.867 --> 02:31:29.773
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:31:29.773 --> 02:31:33.730
LIAM: It would create a facsimile of that, but it
would be worthless.

02:31:33.730 --> 02:31:34.449
TRAVIS: Got it.

02:31:34.449 --> 02:31:37.505
TALIESIN: The things it makes are not--

02:31:37.505 --> 02:31:43.316
SAM: Quick, Caleb, Identify this in ten minutes. I
give you the shield to Identify.

02:31:43.316 --> 02:31:49.974
LIAM: What? (see-n-spell voice) This is a Formica
table, green is its color.

02:31:49.974 --> 02:31:53.544
TALIESIN: I have good news: your favorite chewing
gum--

02:31:53.544 --> 02:31:55.035
MARISHA: Fjord.

02:31:56.225 --> 02:31:57.775
MATT: Goddamn it.

02:31:59.515 --> 02:32:05.693
SAM: What can your imagination make? Keys.
Ladders.

02:32:05.693 --> 02:32:09.782
TRAVIS: (singing)

02:32:09.782 --> 02:32:10.443
TALIESIN: Rope.

02:32:10.443 --> 02:32:12.760
SAM and TALIESIN: Outfits.

02:32:12.760 --> 02:32:13.687
SAM: Clothes?

02:32:13.687 --> 02:32:15.475
LAURA: If you want, they're non-magical items.

02:32:15.475 --> 02:32:16.510
MATT: Yeah.

02:32:16.510 --> 02:32:18.805
SAM: Catwoman outfits.

02:32:18.805 --> 02:32:21.089
MATT: Technically.

02:32:21.089 --> 02:32:28.591
LIAM: This is good, this can blast an enemy with a
bit of arcane oomph.

02:32:28.591 --> 02:32:30.616
SAM: A shield that can fight?

02:32:30.616 --> 02:32:31.992
LIAM: A little bit, yeah.

02:32:31.992 --> 02:32:36.690
SAM: That's so cool. Who can use a shield? Do we
have any shields?

02:32:36.690 --> 02:32:37.990
TRAVIS: Well, Caduceus.

02:32:37.990 --> 02:32:39.187
LAURA: I have a shield.

02:32:39.187 --> 02:32:40.371
LIAM: You have a shield?

02:32:40.371 --> 02:32:41.324
SAM: Caduceus?

02:32:41.324 --> 02:32:43.470
TALIESIN: I have a shield. Do you need a shield?

02:32:43.470 --> 02:32:44.767
TRAVIS: My AC's 17.

02:32:44.767 --> 02:32:46.241
LIAM: Did we bring him down here yet?

02:32:46.241 --> 02:32:47.036
MATT: No.

02:32:47.036 --> 02:32:48.220
LIAM: Go to hell.

02:32:48.220 --> 02:32:51.327
MARISHA: Oh, I was going to say: I go get Fjord.

02:32:51.327 --> 02:32:52.935
TALIESIN: Can I take a look at that thing, maybe?

02:32:52.935 --> 02:32:56.256
MARISHA: Casually, but like I don't want to
interrupt, like a cocktail party.

02:32:56.256 --> 02:32:57.377
MATT: Okay.

02:32:57.377 --> 02:33:09.780
MARISHA: I do the: When you're ready, just (clicks
tongue). Just where we are.

02:33:09.780 --> 02:33:19.431
LAURA: Maybe because it's up-close and personal
with Fjord, or it could be good for us.

02:33:19.431 --> 02:33:21.252
TRAVIS: Why don't you protect the clerics?

02:33:21.252 --> 02:33:25.052
LAURA and TALIESIN: Well... (laughter)

02:33:25.052 --> 02:33:25.814
TRAVIS: Aw.

02:33:25.814 --> 02:33:27.792
TALIESIN: What's your AC again?

02:33:27.792 --> 02:33:34.121
TRAVIS: 17. (pause) No, you guys have it.

02:33:34.121 --> 02:33:36.676
LAURA: It's pretty cool.

02:33:36.676 --> 02:33:40.768
TALIESIN: Yeah, I really like my shield, though,
but this is interesting.

02:33:40.768 --> 02:33:44.355
SAM: Can I use a shield? No.

02:33:44.355 --> 02:33:45.004
TALIESIN: No.

02:33:45.004 --> 02:33:46.075
MATT: I don't think you--

02:33:46.075 --> 02:33:46.824
LAURA: (laughter) "No!"

02:33:46.824 --> 02:33:54.638
MARISHA: Technically anyone can <i>use</i> a shield,
but if you're not proficient in it--

02:33:54.638 --> 02:33:57.973
MATT: Technically anyone can use a shield, but
you're not proficient you get a bunch of bad things.

02:33:57.973 --> 02:33:59.516
TALIESIN: This would push it to 18. All right.

02:33:59.516 --> 02:34:02.234
MARISHA: Because we've just covered this in our
Handbooker Helper episode.

02:34:02.234 --> 02:34:03.393
SAM: Oh! Light armor.

02:34:03.393 --> 02:34:04.324
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

02:34:04.324 --> 02:34:05.197
TALIESIN: All right.

02:34:05.197 --> 02:34:08.859
MATT: Correct, no shields.

02:34:08.859 --> 02:34:14.051
TRAVIS: Consider it a gift, after nearly dying.

02:34:14.051 --> 02:34:15.039
TALIESIN: Fair.

02:34:15.039 --> 02:34:17.868
TRAVIS: In the past, well, now eight days.

02:34:17.868 --> 02:34:21.455
TALIESIN: I may just, for my own personal
aesthetic, try and mount my beetle wings onto

02:34:21.455 --> 02:34:25.442
this, but I like it. I'll do that later.

02:34:25.442 --> 02:34:26.930
MATT: All right.

02:34:26.930 --> 02:34:31.686
SAM: What do we do now, Fjord?

02:34:31.686 --> 02:34:33.437
MATT: I'll have to add it to there myself.

02:34:33.437 --> 02:34:34.904
TALIESIN: You'll have to add it?

02:34:34.904 --> 02:34:36.515
MATT: It's a custom item.

02:34:39.099 --> 02:34:41.546
MARISHA: I told him, "When you're ready, this is
where we are."

02:34:41.546 --> 02:34:44.040
TALIESIN: In the meantime, it's just plus one to
my AC. How many attuned items can I have

02:34:44.040 --> 02:34:45.122
at this level?

02:34:45.122 --> 02:34:46.450
MATT: For any level it's three.

02:34:46.450 --> 02:34:48.081
TALIESIN: Three, all right.

02:34:48.081 --> 02:34:51.311
LIAM: Let's get Captain Tusktooth down here,
because that was an interesting afternoon, but it

02:34:51.311 --> 02:34:53.293
was not what I want to do with the rest of my
life.

02:34:53.293 --> 02:34:55.048
MARISHA: I have a lot of ideas.

02:34:55.048 --> 02:34:56.771
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll find my way back down to the
rest of them.

02:34:56.771 --> 02:34:58.913
MATT: Okay, there you go.

02:34:58.913 --> 02:35:00.845
TRAVIS: What'd we get?

02:35:00.845 --> 02:35:02.417
SAM: Nothing.

02:35:02.417 --> 02:35:03.327
TRAVIS: Shit.

02:35:03.327 --> 02:35:04.869
LAURA: Just some paint.

02:35:04.869 --> 02:35:08.462
TRAVIS: Weird that they would have an armored guy
with a longsword protecting a paintbrush

02:35:08.462 --> 02:35:10.472
that does nothing.

02:35:10.472 --> 02:35:13.127
MARISHA: How do you feel about floating dicks?

02:35:13.127 --> 02:35:14.473
TRAVIS: I'm not opposed.

02:35:14.473 --> 02:35:15.435
MARISHA: All right.

02:35:15.435 --> 02:35:17.373
SAM: It's a floating dick-making paint.

02:35:17.373 --> 02:35:19.331
TALIESIN: Better than sinking dicks, I suppose.

02:35:19.331 --> 02:35:21.436
LAURA: I mean, should I try it, just to see?

02:35:21.436 --> 02:35:23.480
SAM: Don't waste any paint, but yes!

02:35:23.480 --> 02:35:29.791
LAURA: I'm going to paint on the floor the
teeniest of dicks. Like, this big.

02:35:29.791 --> 02:35:32.801
MATT: Okay. You take a little bit, you do this
little dick, and suddenly--

02:35:32.801 --> 02:35:35.313
SAM: A flaccid penis, or an erect penis?

02:35:35.313 --> 02:35:37.516
LAURA: An erect penis.

02:35:37.516 --> 02:35:38.932
MARISHA: Of course.

02:35:38.932 --> 02:35:40.334
LIAM: That's the go-to.

02:35:40.334 --> 02:35:44.336
MATT: Okay, and you paint it, and finish it, and
you look at it, and take the edge of the

02:35:44.336 --> 02:35:46.059
paintbrush and nudge it, and it rolls a bit.

02:35:46.059 --> 02:35:50.667
(surprised laughter)

02:35:50.667 --> 02:35:55.813
MATT: It's like a stone sculpture; it's not
fleshy, it's not made of flesh.

02:35:55.813 --> 02:35:59.764
TRAVIS: You didn't Frankenstein, make that
triumphant bastard into life.

02:35:59.764 --> 02:36:03.346
MATT: Yeah, you're not turning this into Second
Life, with all the different fucking floppy dicks

02:36:03.346 --> 02:36:04.895
flying everywhere.

02:36:04.895 --> 02:36:07.961
TRAVIS: It's not the dick brush, it's the
paintbrush!

02:36:07.961 --> 02:36:13.750
LAURA: Wait, I have a question, then. If I make a
tree, if I draw a tree, would the tree be made of

02:36:13.750 --> 02:36:16.759
stone or would it be made out of-- would it look
like a tree?

02:36:16.759 --> 02:36:19.720
MATT: You'd have to find out and try.

02:36:19.720 --> 02:36:24.466
TALIESIN: This may actually give you-- wait, what
is your AC bonus to your shield?

02:36:24.466 --> 02:36:25.911
TRAVIS: Just +1.

02:36:25.911 --> 02:36:29.718
TALIESIN: This would actually-- this doesn't give
me an 18, this just keeps me at 17 because I was

02:36:29.718 --> 02:36:31.130
already at a +2 with my shield.

02:36:31.130 --> 02:36:32.112
TRAVIS: Oh!

02:36:32.112 --> 02:36:33.997
MATT: No, it's +2 and then +1 on top of that.

02:36:33.997 --> 02:36:36.409
TALIESIN: Oh okay, so right now it's only giving
me a +2.

02:36:36.409 --> 02:36:38.064
MATT: Hmm, I'll double-check that.

02:36:38.064 --> 02:36:43.201
TALIESIN: Maybe I haven't-- oh, never mind, now
it's working, there we go. I hadn't attuned it.

02:36:43.201 --> 02:36:44.641
MATT: Ah, there you go.

02:36:44.641 --> 02:36:47.698
LAURA: I pick up the little stone penis. Who wants
it?

02:36:47.698 --> 02:36:52.622
TRAVIS: So we found a paintbrush that you can
paint things and they will come into being? Is

02:36:52.622 --> 02:36:53.609
that what it is?

02:36:53.609 --> 02:36:55.056
SAM: That's right.

02:36:55.056 --> 02:36:56.935
TRAVIS: Wow, and the shield?

02:36:56.935 --> 02:37:01.877
TALIESIN: A little gaudy for my tastes, but I'm
going to do a little work to it.

02:37:01.877 --> 02:37:04.533
LIAM: Will hurt your enemies, not just protect
you.

02:37:04.533 --> 02:37:10.070
TRAVIS: Can I just ask how everybody-- humor me--
feels after today?

02:37:10.070 --> 02:37:12.000
MARISHA: Wow.

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.096
TALIESIN: Prefer not to make a habit of that.

02:37:14.096 --> 02:37:15.590
TRAVIS: Yeah, me neither.

02:37:15.590 --> 02:37:23.027
MARISHA: I mean, it feels like a bucket list item
checked off the list, but, there were several

02:37:23.027 --> 02:37:27.052
times that I might have questioned everything that
we were doing.

02:37:27.052 --> 02:37:31.165
TRAVIS: Wait, bucket list as in "hijack a ship
before you die" kind of a thing?

02:37:31.165 --> 02:37:36.678
MARISHA: I mean, we just had the full pirate
experience that a travel agency could not provide.

02:37:36.678 --> 02:37:42.423
It was very authentic, and that was amazing.

02:37:42.423 --> 02:37:45.534
TALIESIN: You're hard to follow sometimes, you
know that?

02:37:45.534 --> 02:37:46.523
MARISHA: Huh?

02:37:46.523 --> 02:37:48.113
TALIESIN: Ah, nothing, just--

02:37:48.113 --> 02:37:52.992
TRAVIS: Nott, I'd ask if you have any
reservations, but you seemed very enthusiastic

02:37:52.992 --> 02:37:54.304
about today's--

02:37:54.304 --> 02:37:58.072
SAM: I was born to be a cannoneer.

02:37:58.072 --> 02:38:07.187
TRAVIS: Uh-huh. I can't promise there will be a
lot of that but at least I know that you're DTF,

02:38:07.187 --> 02:38:08.915
cool. Caleb?

02:38:08.915 --> 02:38:10.258
MARISHA: Down To Fire!

02:38:10.258 --> 02:38:14.893
TRAVIS: Yep, fire. Caleb, how you doing?

02:38:14.893 --> 02:38:22.268
LIAM: I mean, this is a matter of survival. If we
do not cooperate, she's going to kill us. I'm not

02:38:22.268 --> 02:38:29.347
opposed, per se, to what went down today, but it's
not what I want to do with my life. I would prefer

02:38:29.347 --> 02:38:35.928
to break away from this woman, but we're here for
you right now. You are trying to figure out, you

02:38:35.928 --> 02:38:41.900
know, your thing. I think I'd like to hear from
you what the long-term plan is. Are we on the

02:38:41.900 --> 02:38:45.082
ship, in the sea? Is that what you're after?

02:38:45.082 --> 02:38:55.660
TRAVIS: Yeah, actually I do have some news to
share. Avantika apparently has come across my old

02:38:55.660 --> 02:39:05.907
mentor, Vandren, before. She knew him. Apparently
he carried the same sword that I have, it's called

02:39:06.127 --> 02:39:16.335
the Sword of Fathoms. Has a name. She's of the
opinion that he always carried on him the sword

02:39:16.335 --> 02:39:25.685
and another one of those spheres, an eye. She
asked me if I knew where the ship that I was on

02:39:25.685 --> 02:39:32.920
went down. I did recall the area and she believes
that if we were to search that shipwreck we might

02:39:32.920 --> 02:39:48.078
find this third sphere. She has the ability to
mess with water now, and in some of the dreams

02:39:48.078 --> 02:39:54.551
I've been having, I believe there's quite a bit
more where that has come from.

02:39:54.551 --> 02:39:57.972
MARISHA: Still having those dreams, then.

02:39:57.972 --> 02:40:09.047
TRAVIS: Not all the time. I admit, I've been very
excited about all of this, but the things I see

02:40:09.047 --> 02:40:14.262
are world changing. Scary.

02:40:14.262 --> 02:40:17.831
MARISHA: In a good way or a bad way?

02:40:17.831 --> 02:40:21.873
TRAVIS: I don't know.

02:40:21.873 --> 02:40:25.397
MARISHA: Or is it dependent on the operator?

02:40:25.397 --> 02:40:27.890
TRAVIS: I don't know that either.

02:40:27.890 --> 02:40:36.984
LIAM: What is the good scenario, the good version,
of releasing a massive serpent onto

02:40:36.984 --> 02:40:38.979
the Menagerie Coast?

02:40:38.979 --> 02:40:52.856
TRAVIS: Well when you say it like that... I don't
know. I meant only the power that might come

02:40:52.856 --> 02:40:55.345
before that happens.

02:40:55.345 --> 02:41:02.262
LAURA: Does the serpent get released if the little
orbs are spread out amongst other people or do

02:41:02.434 --> 02:41:04.577
they all have to be in one person?

02:41:04.577 --> 02:41:05.797
TRAVIS: I--

02:41:05.797 --> 02:41:08.384
TALIESIN: Or three?

02:41:08.384 --> 02:41:13.604
TRAVIS: I actually don't know. I'm just assuming
that because she placed her sphere at the bottom

02:41:13.604 --> 02:41:18.579
of that well in that temple, there are two other
temples which we have to do the same thing and

02:41:18.579 --> 02:41:22.061
that might lead to the release of that serpent.

02:41:22.061 --> 02:41:28.882
MARISHA: But you think that one of the other's
spheres is at the bottom of the shipwreck. Not

02:41:28.882 --> 02:41:30.490
necessarily a temple.

02:41:30.490 --> 02:41:33.213
TRAVIS: Right, the third sphere, and I have the
second.

02:41:33.213 --> 02:41:34.588
MARISHA: But you--

02:41:34.588 --> 02:41:35.907
LAURA: But doesn't she have two spheres?

02:41:35.907 --> 02:41:39.997
SAM: No, she had one, but she got rid of it. Fjord
has one.

02:41:39.997 --> 02:41:42.283
MARISHA: Fjord and he traded it for power.

02:41:42.283 --> 02:41:45.747
SAM: So it would good for us to get that last one
so that she can't.

02:41:45.747 --> 02:41:48.017
LAURA: What if she does get the last one?

02:41:48.017 --> 02:41:49.945
SAM: Then we would have failed.

02:41:49.945 --> 02:41:54.940
MARISHA: Well, at least she would be twice as
powerful as Fjord is one.

02:41:54.940 --> 02:41:57.319
TRAVIS: It would be a lot for one person.

02:41:57.319 --> 02:41:58.707
MARISHA: I mean there's also--

02:41:58.707 --> 02:42:00.298
SAM: She would want the third.

02:42:00.298 --> 02:42:01.754
MARISHA: Which is inside of you.

02:42:01.754 --> 02:42:04.239
SAM: Which means she would want Fjord's body.

02:42:04.239 --> 02:42:10.454
TRAVIS: Correct. Can I just take a second and ask
Caduceus to check the door?

02:42:10.454 --> 02:42:15.817
TALIESIN: I've been paying very close attention
and listening in to the hallway and trying to keep

02:42:15.817 --> 02:42:16.623
a very--

02:42:16.623 --> 02:42:19.759
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:42:19.759 --> 02:42:24.387
TALIESIN: (blows raspberry) 15.

02:42:24.387 --> 02:42:29.784
MATT: Okay. It seems to be fairly clear.

02:42:29.784 --> 02:42:32.357
TALIESIN: Haven't heard any footsteps or--

02:42:32.357 --> 02:42:33.460
MATT: No.

02:42:33.460 --> 02:42:37.858
SAM: Look at the port window! Is there a port
window?

02:42:37.858 --> 02:42:40.997
MATT: In the room you're in currently, there is
not a port window.

02:42:40.997 --> 02:42:55.346
TRAVIS: Without saying too much more, I think it's
best that we all listen to Caleb's words and play along.

02:42:55.346 --> 02:42:58.843
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

02:42:58.843 --> 02:43:01.437
TRAVIS: We'll be making our way to Darktow.

02:43:01.437 --> 02:43:02.889
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:43:02.889 --> 02:43:06.268
TRAVIS: And then we will reevaluate.

02:43:06.268 --> 02:43:12.094
SAM: But the overall mission is to get-- Don't say
anything?

02:43:12.094 --> 02:43:19.761
TRAVIS: Just feel like-- and I'll try and be
subtle as possible that only the people in the

02:43:19.761 --> 02:43:25.392
room would hear. (whispering) There are people
that we can't see. I just don't feel like this is

02:43:25.392 --> 02:43:27.284
the best place to converse.

02:43:27.284 --> 02:43:30.453
SAM: We've been feeling around the air.

02:43:30.453 --> 02:43:32.865
TRAVIS: It's not our ship.

02:43:32.865 --> 02:43:45.870
TALIESIN: I feel like for the time being, it just
might be best to-- be the best we can be here and

02:43:45.870 --> 02:43:52.983
be as helpful as humanly possible. Our goals are
relatively aligned and as long as we don't have to

02:43:52.983 --> 02:43:58.595
hurt anybody, I'm all right. But the rest of these
people--

02:43:58.595 --> 02:44:05.205
MARISHA: Do we (whispering) need more
information?

02:44:05.205 --> 02:44:06.349
TALIESIN: Always.

02:44:06.349 --> 02:44:09.097
MARISHA: (whispering) To find your ship?

02:44:09.097 --> 02:44:14.997
TRAVIS: I think I would know the location based
off the trade route.

02:44:14.997 --> 02:44:22.178
MATT: You know the general vicinity of where it
would have happened. It would take a little bit of

02:44:22.178 --> 02:44:24.733
searching and a little bit of-- you know.

02:44:24.733 --> 02:44:26.596
TRAVIS: At the bottom of the fucking ocean?

02:44:26.596 --> 02:44:31.938
MATT: Yeah. Depending on what you have at your
disposal, like definitely narrow the search, but

02:44:31.938 --> 02:44:35.539
if it's just based on your memory it would take a
while to find it, but you know the general area

02:44:35.539 --> 02:44:37.090
where it went down.

02:44:37.090 --> 02:44:52.200
MARISHA: Sotto: I was debating heavily in watching
Avantika to see if, with a distraction of trying

02:44:52.200 --> 02:45:04.373
to board the pirate ship today, that I can maybe
sneak into her office with the distraction. But I

02:45:04.373 --> 02:45:10.721
noticed she was very adamant holding back and
watching the entire scenery. It was not safe to go

02:45:10.721 --> 02:45:16.762
into her quarters. If we need to get into her
office, I think it's going to have to be an

02:45:16.762 --> 02:45:19.455
important enough and big enough distraction.

02:45:19.455 --> 02:45:25.904
LAURA: Maybe, Fjord, you can, like, go seduce her
or something. Then, you know, with the seduction,

02:45:25.904 --> 02:45:28.981
then (whispers) you can sneak into her office.

02:45:28.981 --> 02:45:33.116
SAM: Some people give up information when they've
been seduced as well.

02:45:33.116 --> 02:45:34.797
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

02:45:34.797 --> 02:45:39.021
SAM: Is that something you could do?

02:45:39.021 --> 02:45:41.364
TRAVIS: All good ideas.

02:45:41.364 --> 02:45:44.248
LAURA: It just seems like she's into you, you
know?

02:45:44.248 --> 02:45:45.797
SAM: I noticed that as well.

02:45:45.797 --> 02:45:48.476
TRAVIS: Trying to use that to our advantage.

02:45:48.476 --> 02:45:50.032
MARISHA: (whispers) You're doing great!

02:45:50.032 --> 02:45:58.599
TRAVIS: Thanks, I appreciate it. I'm trying to
keep her close. If she starts to suspect us, we'll

02:45:58.599 --> 02:46:10.411
be in trouble. If anyone feels uncomfortable with
how things are going, please, let me know. My

02:46:10.411 --> 02:46:16.743
curiosity is not worth dying for or doing
something you feel like you'd regret. I value what

02:46:16.743 --> 02:46:18.544
everyone thinks here.

02:46:18.544 --> 02:46:25.599
MARISHA: I think if we don't do anything, it means
your eventual demise.

02:46:25.599 --> 02:46:29.733
TRAVIS: Well, that's just fucking dark.

02:46:29.733 --> 02:46:31.701
SAM: No, I think she's right.

02:46:31.701 --> 02:46:35.457
LAURA: Yeah, I think you're fucked.

02:46:35.457 --> 02:46:38.997
MARISHA: Unless we beat Avantika to the punch.

02:46:38.997 --> 02:46:42.532
LAURA: If you don't fuck, you're going to get
fucked.

02:46:42.532 --> 02:46:43.102
SAM: Ooh!

02:46:43.102 --> 02:46:45.873
(laughter)

02:46:46.853 --> 02:46:50.209
TRAVIS: Now, Jester, where would you learn a
phrase like that?

02:46:52.449 --> 02:46:53.696
LAURA: I lived--

02:46:53.696 --> 02:46:55.214
SAM: She lived in a brothel.

02:46:55.214 --> 02:46:55.820
LAURA: Yeah.

02:47:00.380 --> 02:47:05.600
SAM: Do what you need to do to get all the
information out of her that you can. If we see you

02:47:05.877 --> 02:47:10.661
cozying up with her, we'll know. We'll know that
it's just an act.

02:47:10.661 --> 02:47:18.914
TRAVIS: Cool, yeah. Caleb said something similar
last night-- or, a couple days ago. All right,

02:47:18.914 --> 02:47:22.136
well, enjoy the paintbrush.

02:47:22.136 --> 02:47:26.635
MARISHA: Oh is that it? Is that our meeting? Okay,
yeah.

02:47:26.635 --> 02:47:29.373
TRAVIS: I mean, we're going to find our way to
Darktow.

02:47:29.373 --> 02:47:31.905
LAURA: Does it make you uncomfortable? Do you want
someone else to seduce her?

02:47:31.905 --> 02:47:34.880
MARISHA: Yeah, because I volunteer.

02:47:34.880 --> 02:47:38.231
LIAM: She's made her interest pretty clear.

02:47:38.231 --> 02:47:42.864
TALIESIN: Well, when we want to find the ship, I
think I might be able to help.

02:47:42.864 --> 02:47:44.881
TRAVIS: With the seducing?

02:47:44.881 --> 02:47:51.309
TALIESIN: What? No. I mean, no. Definitely not.

02:47:51.309 --> 02:47:55.304
TRAVIS: I mean, Caduceus, if you want to teach me
a thing a two about wooing a woman--

02:47:55.304 --> 02:48:02.074
TALIESIN: Yeah no, I really don't think I have
anything to add to that. I think you've been doing

02:48:02.074 --> 02:48:03.926
just fine.

02:48:03.926 --> 02:48:06.884
TRAVIS: Yes to what you said, and yes to what you
said.

02:48:06.884 --> 02:48:08.822
TALIESIN: I think I might be able to help you find
the ship.

02:48:08.822 --> 02:48:11.232
MARISHA: You want me to help seduce Avantika.

02:48:11.232 --> 02:48:12.634
TRAVIS: You just do you, girl.

02:48:12.634 --> 02:48:13.391
MARISHA: All right.

02:48:13.391 --> 02:48:16.027
TALIESIN: I don't understand what any of this is
anymore.

02:48:16.027 --> 02:48:20.690
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think that will be very valuable
when the time comes.

02:48:20.690 --> 02:48:27.194
TALIESIN: I thought-- Oh, about finding the ship,
that's all.

02:48:27.194 --> 02:48:29.694
TRAVIS: About what time of the day is it?

02:48:29.694 --> 02:48:32.844
MATT: At this point, it's later afternoon.

02:48:32.844 --> 02:48:35.441
MARISHA: Oh! It's early.

02:48:35.441 --> 02:48:44.029
TRAVIS: Time to break out the banana margaritas!
It's only afternoon!

02:48:44.029 --> 02:48:46.134
MARISHA: It's four o'clock!

02:48:46.134 --> 02:48:49.354
MATT: It's like five or so; you're like an hour or
two from dusk.

02:48:49.354 --> 02:48:51.024
MARISHA: Okay.

02:48:51.024 --> 02:48:57.214
SAM: Let's just do our jobs. I've got a cannon to
fix.

02:48:57.214 --> 02:48:58.692
TRAVIS: Sounds good.

02:48:58.692 --> 02:49:00.053
MATT: All right.

02:49:00.053 --> 02:49:02.487
MARISHA: I'm going to make some barrels?

02:49:02.487 --> 02:49:06.871
TRAVIS: Caleb, can I speak to you for a moment?
Above deck?

02:49:06.871 --> 02:49:08.356
LIAM: Of course.

02:49:08.356 --> 02:49:09.719
TRAVIS: I'll go up.

02:49:09.719 --> 02:49:11.818
LIAM: I will follow.

02:49:11.818 --> 02:49:13.386
MATT: The rest of you go about your business?

02:49:13.386 --> 02:49:14.439
LAURA: I will follow.

02:49:14.439 --> 02:49:18.678
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a nap. Taking a short
rest.

02:49:18.678 --> 02:49:19.482
MATT: Yasha does the same.

02:49:19.482 --> 02:49:21.777
LAURA: I'm going to stand at a distance looking
over the rail.

02:49:21.777 --> 02:49:22.669
MATT: Okay.

02:49:22.669 --> 02:49:25.349
TRAVIS: How far away are you?

02:49:25.349 --> 02:49:30.892
LIAM: How far away is she? We're in broad
daylight.

02:49:30.892 --> 02:49:34.548
LAURA: I'm like, you know, far away.

02:49:34.548 --> 02:49:36.331
SAM: Six, seven feet.

02:49:36.331 --> 02:49:41.315
LAURA: Just looking out, looking, drawing, I'm
very distracted.

02:49:41.315 --> 02:49:43.542
LIAM: Just dicks dropping into the ocean.

02:49:43.542 --> 02:49:46.528
TRAVIS: (splashing)

02:49:46.528 --> 02:49:50.541
(laughter)

02:49:50.541 --> 02:49:52.258
MATT: How far away are you, Jester?

02:49:52.258 --> 02:49:54.079
LAURA: I think 15 feet.

02:49:54.079 --> 02:49:55.039
MATT: 15 feet.

02:49:55.039 --> 02:49:56.187
LIAM: Not far.

02:49:56.187 --> 02:50:06.185
TRAVIS: Seeing where Jester is, I'll pull Caleb
aside. May I ask you a frank question?

02:50:06.185 --> 02:50:09.859
LIAM: Of course you can. I scan around for
Avantika.

02:50:09.859 --> 02:50:12.187
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:50:12.187 --> 02:50:16.431
LIAM: Okay. That is a 22.

02:50:16.431 --> 02:50:22.121
MATT: Looking about, across the deck, you do not
see her currently near or visible.

02:50:22.121 --> 02:50:32.196
TRAVIS: I had to admit I found myself a bit
surprised. My initial impression of you was

02:50:32.196 --> 02:50:42.940
someone a bit timid and maybe reserved; meek even.
Your tone, your opinion of what to do with

02:50:42.940 --> 02:50:56.389
Avantika in order to make sure that we're okay, it
seemed very... calculated. Very... risky. Do you

02:50:56.389 --> 02:51:04.642
mind me asking if you've-- Have you ever
sacrificed anything in order to achieve a greater

02:51:04.642 --> 02:51:14.590
goal? Because I feel like I am swimming in the
deep end and I don't quite know what I'm doing.

02:51:14.590 --> 02:51:22.238
LIAM: You are dealing with very large
responsibilities right now. I don't envy your

02:51:22.238 --> 02:51:38.723
position. You know, my father was a soldier and he
expected a lot. I learned a lot from him. I've

02:51:38.723 --> 02:51:44.938
tried to live up to the man that he was and I've
largely failed, but I've picked up what I could.

02:51:44.938 --> 02:52:02.572
Used my wits, understand my surroundings. I wish I
had half the courage he did. I don't know. You

02:52:02.572 --> 02:52:11.730
know, I think traveling with all of you has
emboldened me some. I was alone for a long time

02:52:11.730 --> 02:52:24.846
and ran from everything. I like this group and I
enjoy traveling with you, Fjord.

02:52:24.846 --> 02:52:38.142
TRAVIS: Likewise. You don't miss much, do you?

02:52:38.142 --> 02:52:45.100
LIAM: I've always been like that; I have a very
good memory. I remember everything.

02:52:45.100 --> 02:52:54.270
TRAVIS: You have a very shrewd sensibility as
well. You seem to be able to weigh pros and cons

02:52:54.270 --> 02:52:58.326
in an equation, a scenario.

02:52:58.326 --> 02:53:04.024
LIAM and TRAVIS: Math brain.

02:53:04.024 --> 02:53:08.694
LIAM: I feel like a fool much of the time. I'm
glad you think so highly of me.

02:53:08.694 --> 02:53:15.687
TRAVIS: I do. I don't mean any of it as a
critique, but more as a compliment and I'll add

02:53:15.687 --> 02:53:27.629
with it a request. Keep that eye of yours on
Avantika for me. I don't entirely know what her

02:53:27.629 --> 02:53:37.584
intentions are, but I feel like there are only a
few that I could ask to exercise quick judgment in

02:53:37.584 --> 02:53:39.050
a moment of need.

02:53:39.050 --> 02:53:47.220
LIAM: I start nervously twiddling a wire in my
hand absentmindedly.

02:53:47.220 --> 02:53:56.689
TRAVIS: I think you know what I mean, but in case
this thing gets out of hand, can I count on you to

02:53:56.689 --> 02:54:01.132
right the ship if need be?

02:54:01.132 --> 02:54:04.551
LIAM: Keep the group safe?

02:54:04.551 --> 02:54:06.229
TRAVIS: Of course.

02:54:06.229 --> 02:54:11.268
LIAM: As always, I will do my best.

02:54:11.268 --> 02:54:18.860
TRAVIS: Thank you and thank you for talking with
me.

02:54:18.860 --> 02:54:31.829
LIAM: I cough very hard into my hands and cast
Message to him and briefly, quietly say: I think

02:54:31.829 --> 02:54:34.658
that woman is going to try to kill you, I really
do.

02:54:34.658 --> 02:54:45.742
TRAVIS: Yeah. Just so. I'll turn and walk off.

02:54:45.742 --> 02:54:47.727
LIAM: (coughing)

02:54:47.727 --> 02:54:49.689
LAURA: You need some water, Caleb?

02:54:49.689 --> 02:54:51.267
LIAM: Yeah, do you have some?

02:54:51.267 --> 02:54:55.748
LAURA: Uh. (pause) I create water in my hands.

02:54:55.748 --> 02:54:58.773
TRAVIS: Wait, you can do that?

02:54:58.773 --> 02:55:04.044
LIAM: I receive it. There's not much left. Most of
it spilled.

02:55:04.044 --> 02:55:07.036
LAURA: I'll keep creating it in your hands as you
drink.

02:55:07.036 --> 02:55:09.149
SAM: You can create water?

02:55:09.149 --> 02:55:10.041
LAURA: Yeah.

02:55:10.041 --> 02:55:11.084
SAM: When did that happen?

02:55:11.084 --> 02:55:12.259
LAURA: I've always been able to do it.

02:55:12.259 --> 02:55:13.801
TRAVIS: What do you mean?

02:55:13.801 --> 02:55:14.897
LAURA: Shut up.

02:55:14.897 --> 02:55:17.383
LIAM: Is this a custom?

02:55:17.383 --> 02:55:22.250
LAURA: Yes. Just keep drinking. Keep going.

02:55:22.250 --> 02:55:24.049
LIAM: It's good.

02:55:26.259 --> 02:55:34.507
MATT: A few more days' travel to Darktow. A couple
of moments here. In one night that you are in your

02:55:34.788 --> 02:55:45.756
room sketching your book, testing out some of your
new paints, you feel a hand on your shoulder. You

02:55:45.756 --> 02:55:57.793
glance over and you can see the pale, soft fingers
and a dark greenish sleeve resting there. You

02:55:57.793 --> 02:56:05.437
glance over to the side and you can see the
draping hood and the slight curved smile across

02:56:05.437 --> 02:56:12.731
the angular chin of the Traveler protruding from
beneath the cloak.

02:56:12.731 --> 02:56:13.699
LAURA: Hi.

02:56:13.699 --> 02:56:21.389
MATT: "Hello. I see you found a new toy."

02:56:21.389 --> 02:56:23.456
LAURA: I have magical paint!

02:56:23.456 --> 02:56:36.295
MATT: "Well I'm quite excited at the things you're
capable of, Jester. How are things?"

02:56:36.295 --> 02:56:44.792
LAURA: They're pretty good. Did you want me to
make you something with the paint?

02:56:44.792 --> 02:56:46.884
MATT: "Surprise me."

02:56:46.884 --> 02:56:51.877
LAURA: Okay. Um, Traveler?

02:56:51.877 --> 02:56:54.056
MATT: "Yes, my dear?"

02:56:54.056 --> 02:57:01.346
LAURA: Are you having fun on our trip?

02:57:01.346 --> 02:57:12.845
MATT: "Yes, I've been... pleasantly surprised."

02:57:12.845 --> 02:57:14.799
LAURA: We're pirates!

02:57:14.799 --> 02:57:18.262
MATT: "I know, your tenacity is impressive."

02:57:18.262 --> 02:57:21.926
LAURA: We stole things, but they gave something
back just like you always teach, you know?

02:57:21.926 --> 02:57:28.001
MATT: "Maintain that balance. That seed of
chaos."

02:57:28.001 --> 02:57:33.089
LAURA: Traveler, how do I make a boy like me?

02:57:33.089 --> 02:57:41.703
MATT: "Well there are many different enchantments
that could achieve the goals you seek."

02:57:41.703 --> 02:57:47.226
LAURA: I don't know if I want to do it with an
enchantment.

02:57:47.226 --> 02:57:49.971
MATT: "Trickery?"

02:57:49.971 --> 02:57:52.365
LAURA: Maybe?

02:57:52.365 --> 02:58:13.821
MATT: "Listen. Listen to what piques his interest.
And then happen to be the source when he needs it.

02:58:13.821 --> 02:58:20.229
"If that fails, there are plenty of enchantments
that can sway his mind."

02:58:20.229 --> 02:58:22.413
LAURA: I mean, right? You'll help me out with
that?

02:58:22.413 --> 02:58:24.215
MATT: "I'll do my best."

02:58:24.215 --> 02:58:26.456
LAURA: You're not jealous, are you?

02:58:26.456 --> 02:58:27.398
MATT: "No."

02:58:27.398 --> 02:58:30.219
LAURA: You'll always be my number one love.

02:58:30.219 --> 02:58:35.537
MATT: "I know. So what are you making me?"

02:58:35.537 --> 02:58:39.956
LAURA: I want it to be a surprise for you, I can't
tell you.

02:58:39.956 --> 02:58:41.549
MATT: "I'll wait."

02:58:41.549 --> 02:58:44.940
LAURA: Okay. I'm glad you're here.

02:58:44.940 --> 02:58:46.970
MATT: "I'm never far."

02:58:51.550 --> 02:58:53.115
LAURA: It's a surprise!

02:58:54.786 --> 02:58:59.698
MATT: (laughs) What are you making him?

02:58:59.698 --> 02:59:15.695
LAURA: Oh gosh. Oh my goodness. Okay, with my
magical paint-- Oh gosh. I was planning on fucking

02:59:15.695 --> 02:59:24.450
up some other things, but right now I will make a
little shrine, like a little statue of the

02:59:24.450 --> 02:59:29.932
Traveler, that way I can pray to him.

02:59:29.932 --> 02:59:39.993
MATT: As you finish painting it, it takes gravity.
It almost seems to fall a centimeter and center

02:59:39.993 --> 02:59:46.286
itself. It goes from a two-dimensional shift, it's
almost like blinking--

02:59:46.286 --> 02:59:49.211
LAURA: I want him shimmery green.

02:59:49.211 --> 02:59:55.021
MATT: Sitting up from the edge of the bed, the
cloaked figure walks over and lifts it and

02:59:55.021 --> 02:59:58.760
inspects it and places it back down.

02:59:58.760 --> 03:00:01.294
LAURA: What do you think?

03:00:01.294 --> 03:00:03.301
MATT: "You're getting better."

03:00:03.301 --> 03:00:06.767
LAURA: I could leave these around other places?
What do you think?

03:00:06.767 --> 03:00:11.715
MATT: "Preferably where it would be the least
expected."

03:00:11.715 --> 03:00:12.868
LAURA: Okay.

03:00:12.868 --> 03:00:15.118
MATT: "And the creepiest to find."

03:00:15.118 --> 03:00:16.421
LAURA: Okay.

03:00:16.421 --> 03:00:19.683
MATT: "I'm excited."

03:00:19.683 --> 03:00:23.139
LAURA: I've got to get to work.

03:00:23.139 --> 03:00:24.015
MATT: "Yes."

03:00:24.015 --> 03:00:26.017
LAURA: I can make so many of these.

03:00:26.017 --> 03:00:28.319
MATT: "Make me proud, Jester."

03:00:28.319 --> 03:00:29.453
LAURA: I will.

03:00:29.453 --> 03:00:32.552
MATT: "The time's coming soon, we'll meet the rest
of your brethren."

03:00:32.552 --> 03:00:33.270
MARISHA: What?

03:00:33.270 --> 03:00:35.303
LAURA: Right, I wrote it down! It's soon, right?

03:00:35.303 --> 03:00:37.251
MARISHA: What does that mean?

03:00:37.251 --> 03:00:39.189
SAM: (whispering) The rest of your brethren?

03:00:39.189 --> 03:00:42.300
LAURA: Yeah, in like less than a year.

03:00:42.300 --> 03:00:43.897
TRAVIS: What?

03:00:43.897 --> 03:00:45.660
MATT: "Soon, my dear."

03:00:45.660 --> 03:00:48.529
MARISHA: Is there like an Advent calendar?

03:00:48.529 --> 03:00:53.746
MATT: As you look up from your notes, closing your
book, you turn to look and the Traveler is gone.

03:00:53.746 --> 03:00:58.485
TRAVIS: That's the first we heard that, right?

03:00:58.485 --> 03:01:01.599
MARISHA: Less than a year?

03:01:01.599 --> 03:01:05.747
LAURA: Yeah! I wrote down the date somewhere, I
know it.

03:01:05.747 --> 03:01:07.844
TRAVIS: We heard that before, right?

03:01:07.844 --> 03:01:10.478
MATT: You guys don't know anything.

03:01:10.478 --> 03:01:12.838
LIAM: Private conversation.

03:01:12.838 --> 03:01:13.850
MATT: Fjord.

03:01:13.850 --> 03:01:14.912
TRAVIS: Yeah?

03:01:14.912 --> 03:01:18.051
MATT: Maybe two days out from the reefs you go to
bed that night.

03:01:18.051 --> 03:01:19.897
TRAVIS: (whispering) Oh shit!

03:01:19.897 --> 03:01:30.797
(background music)

03:01:30.869 --> 03:01:38.601
MATT: As sleep takes you, you find yourself
kicking through the thick sludge-like waters that

03:01:38.866 --> 03:01:48.112
surround you. Sluggish in your movements, the
darkness all-encompassing, yourself alone in these

03:01:48.112 --> 03:02:00.365
shadowed depths. A faint green light is visible in
the distance. You push and swim towards it, light

03:02:00.365 --> 03:02:10.735
glowing brighter. Closer. As that grows closer, a
second light, even further, impossibly distant but

03:02:10.735 --> 03:02:18.795
you can acknowledge it, rests on the horizon. As
that first light gets brighter, you can see this

03:02:18.795 --> 03:02:30.724
source taking shape. It's a figure. Female. Nude,
also swimming. Avantika, emanating this strange

03:02:30.724 --> 03:02:39.785
green glow. Swimming ahead of you, her body
wreathed in this faint greenish-yellow aura. She

03:02:39.785 --> 03:02:48.624
looks and points to you. The waters around you
seem to glow the same color light. You look down

03:02:48.624 --> 03:02:55.489
at your body and you see that you are now the
third glowing source of this green energy.

03:02:55.489 --> 03:03:04.042
Suddenly, the waters are easy to traverse. What
was once sluggish and difficult to Fjord is second

03:03:04.042 --> 03:03:21.125
nature. A voice comes through. "Watching." The
distant light you see suddenly dives with

03:03:21.125 --> 03:03:28.553
incredible speed. Nearly out of sight, Avantika
dives down after rocketing down below you.

03:03:28.553 --> 03:03:37.222
Breakneck in her speed, you dart after her to give
chase, moving far quicker than you anticipated.

03:03:37.222 --> 03:03:47.575
You realize the water is becoming thinner and
thinner, like air. You're falling. Three shooting

03:03:47.575 --> 03:04:01.302
stars plummeting through a dark sky. "Learn."
Glancing down below this endless void you plummet

03:04:01.302 --> 03:04:09.024
towards, you make out the details from a surface
rushing towards you. You plummet towards an ocean.

03:04:09.024 --> 03:04:17.142
The faint distance endless glittering of moving
shifting waves of some sourceless moonlight, just

03:04:17.142 --> 03:04:26.228
barely giving the shapes below, with three large
masses beneath you like a misshapen triangle of

03:04:26.228 --> 03:04:37.129
land masses of incongruent sizes. One, two, three.
You rocket downward towards the space between the

03:04:37.129 --> 03:04:43.365
three, the center of this triangle. Hitting the
waters of the ocean with tremendous force, impact

03:04:43.365 --> 03:04:51.112
but no pain. You sink. The light of the other two
figures glittering through the lightless waters.

03:04:51.112 --> 03:05:01.309
Down, down, you sink. Until you see a
structure coming to view from below. A tilted

03:05:01.309 --> 03:05:11.335
tower, wrapped in sea vines, the hollow center
providing a wide tunnel further within. You peer

03:05:11.578 --> 03:05:22.040
inside this empty tunnel of the tower's depths and
watch as a sudden bright, yellow light shines from

03:05:22.040 --> 03:05:35.533
within: a gleaming yellow eye. "Reward." As the
two other lights seem to try and drift towards

03:05:35.533 --> 03:05:42.533
you, behind you, you fall into darkness and the
dream ends.

03:05:45.053 --> 03:05:51.136
TRAVIS: Fuck. I wake up and immediately grab the
map.

03:05:51.136 --> 03:05:55.983
MARISHA: Yes, queen, yes.

03:05:55.983 --> 03:05:59.012
LIAM: The wettest dream.

03:05:59.012 --> 03:06:02.097
MARISHA: Fucking triangulation shit.

03:06:02.097 --> 03:06:03.473
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:06:03.473 --> 03:06:05.291
TALIESIN: Blow me into Bermuda.

03:06:05.291 --> 03:06:06.480
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:06:06.480 --> 03:06:14.818
MARISHA: Because we were over here, right? In the
reefs? Uk'otoa?

03:06:15.081 --> 03:06:20.134
TRAVIS: Well, Urukayxl, and we've been heading
towards Darktow, so we've been coming across-- did

03:06:20.134 --> 03:06:29.145
we pass the wall? Coming in this direction, did we
pass--

03:06:29.145 --> 03:06:35.917
MATT: You did, you passed south of it. Your piracy
stunt hit right at this trade route there.

03:06:35.917 --> 03:06:37.263
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:06:37.263 --> 03:06:42.133
MARISHA: I mean, if it's a triangulation--

03:06:42.133 --> 03:06:46.632
SAM: Why would there be one there?

03:06:46.632 --> 03:06:50.552
MARISHA: Well, this is where we're going,
technically this is the shipwreck.

03:06:50.552 --> 03:06:52.828
SAM: That's where we're going, yeah.

03:06:52.828 --> 03:07:00.461
MARISHA: Right? This was where we were.

03:07:00.461 --> 03:07:01.692
TRAVIS: That's where we were.

03:07:01.692 --> 03:07:09.832
MATT: That's where you were. The three masses were
not even in shape and size, and they were clustered.

03:07:09.850 --> 03:07:16.826
MARISHA: There's another reef here.

03:07:16.826 --> 03:07:18.378
TRAVIS: There is.

03:07:18.378 --> 03:07:21.853
MARISHA: Then there's Torrid Reef here.

03:07:21.853 --> 03:07:30.093
TRAVIS: There is, and then dead center is a lot of
space. You could say that this is the center,

03:07:30.093 --> 03:07:37.080
but-- okay.

03:07:37.080 --> 03:07:41.853
LAURA: Are any of those places close to your
shipwreck that you know of?

03:07:41.853 --> 03:07:44.242
TRAVIS: Well, the shipwreck is here.

03:07:44.242 --> 03:07:50.883
SAM: What is this triangle of? Where the three
objects are, or where the three temples are?

03:07:50.883 --> 03:07:53.852
TRAVIS: Well, in the vision the three land masses
are in a triangle.

03:07:53.852 --> 03:07:57.006
MARISHA: Do you know in which direction the ship
was heading?

03:07:57.006 --> 03:07:59.243
TRAVIS: At the time?

03:07:59.243 --> 03:08:04.401
MATT: At the time, from what you recall, the ship
was heading outward.

03:08:04.401 --> 03:08:06.658
TRAVIS: Yeah, so it'd be heading west.

03:08:06.658 --> 03:08:15.938
MARISHA: Maybe he knew where to go, and he was
heading there to get his gift.

03:08:15.938 --> 03:08:17.883
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

03:08:17.883 --> 03:08:24.174
MARISHA: Said Beau in a morning breakfast
conversation or something.

03:08:24.174 --> 03:08:28.941
MATT: Yeah. Anyway. Contemplate this.

03:08:28.941 --> 03:08:31.526
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll be doing that later.

03:08:31.526 --> 03:08:42.711
MATT: In the next few days that pass, eventually
the fog rolls in and the blue, cloudy skies you

03:08:42.711 --> 03:08:50.691
have become familiar with on this journey give way
to gray, rainy, and cold, this marine front

03:08:50.691 --> 03:08:56.593
rolling in as you begin to come upon the outskirts
of the Dragshallow Reefs.

03:08:56.593 --> 03:09:04.659
SAM: Matt? Before you go on, can I just real
quickly steal a bunch of gunpowder, while I was

03:09:04.765 --> 03:09:06.848
learning how to be a powder monkey?

03:09:06.848 --> 03:09:09.854
TRAVIS: You did have days.

03:09:09.854 --> 03:09:15.577
MATT: Okay, you do know that the current master
gunner is keeping a very close eye on you after

03:09:15.577 --> 03:09:16.792
you have exhibited--

03:09:16.792 --> 03:09:18.763
SAM: I'm talking like a pinch here.

03:09:18.763 --> 03:09:19.864
TRAVIS: Shawshank style?

03:09:19.864 --> 03:09:25.352
SAM: Yeah, little pinches at a time. I don't want
tons, I'm not trying to steal a barrel, just

03:09:25.352 --> 03:09:30.568
enough to make one of those bangy arrows again,
just enough for the tip of an arrow.

03:09:30.568 --> 03:09:32.755
MATT: Okay, make a sleight of hand check.

03:09:32.755 --> 03:09:35.728
SAM: That's a natural one.

03:09:35.728 --> 03:09:38.337
MARISHA: Oh my god.

03:09:38.337 --> 03:09:48.688
MATT: Okay. You steal, over time, a pretty decent
amount of this powder. You're pretty damn proud of

03:09:48.688 --> 03:09:56.231
it, yeah. Write down on your inventory you have a
handful of pepper.

03:09:56.246 --> 03:10:00.706
(laughter)

03:10:02.181 --> 03:10:03.861
TALIESIN: Black pepper.

03:10:03.861 --> 03:10:08.861
SAM: I'm going to be trying to construct a
explosive arrowhead at some point.

03:10:08.861 --> 03:10:11.261
MATT: Awesome, go ahead and roll for that.

03:10:11.261 --> 03:10:14.204
LIAM: You've successfully secured deez nuts.

03:10:14.204 --> 03:10:17.582
SAM: What am I doing? Tinker's?

03:10:17.582 --> 03:10:19.184
MATT: This would be tinker tools, yeah.

03:10:19.184 --> 03:10:21.383
TALIESIN: You could make a sneeze arrow, in
theory.

03:10:21.383 --> 03:10:22.943
SAM: What is it, dex?

03:10:22.943 --> 03:10:25.193
MATT: With this one, it would be, yeah, dex, since
you've already made one.

03:10:25.193 --> 03:10:26.274
SAM: 15.

03:10:26.274 --> 03:10:29.521
MATT: 15? Yeah, you manage to construct a pepper
arrow.

03:10:29.521 --> 03:10:32.995
MARISHA: If someone's allergic, they're fucked,
yeah.

03:10:32.995 --> 03:10:35.878
MATT: Pepper bolt, there you go.

03:10:35.878 --> 03:10:40.094
LIAM: When life gives you pepper, make pepper
arrows.

03:10:40.094 --> 03:10:54.487
MATT: The ship skirts around the southern edge of
the reefs. You can now see the tangled graveyard

03:10:54.840 --> 03:11:04.381
of destroyed ships and gathered driftwood marking
the shallow spots across this jagged cluster of

03:11:04.381 --> 03:11:15.543
reef. Curving around a southwestern passage, a
channel, that opens. The channel beckons you entry

03:11:15.543 --> 03:11:25.350
as you turn to head northward to what would be the
center, the heart of this cluster. No more than

03:11:25.350 --> 03:11:30.118
maybe 20 minutes into entering this channel,
Avantika shouts up at the rest of the crew, "Raise

03:11:30.118 --> 03:11:37.167
"the colors!" at which point the massive ogre,
Bouldergut, tosses the gnomish second mate, Ipess,

03:11:37.167 --> 03:11:44.571
high up to the central mast, to the crow's nest,
where he swaps out the flag to a new one, one that

03:11:44.571 --> 03:11:55.444
is straight purple. As it begins to push its way
in, make a perception check.

03:11:55.444 --> 03:11:56.621
MARISHA: All of us?

03:11:56.621 --> 03:11:58.221
TRAVIS: Is the flag just solid purple?

03:11:58.221 --> 03:11:59.714
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:11:59.714 --> 03:12:00.954
MARISHA: We've seen this before.

03:12:00.954 --> 03:12:02.020
LAURA: Natural 20.

03:12:02.020 --> 03:12:04.231
MATT: This is a different flag than the one that
was raised during piracy.

03:12:04.231 --> 03:12:04.902
MARISHA: Okay.

03:12:04.902 --> 03:12:06.317
MATT: Natural what?

03:12:06.317 --> 03:12:07.162
LAURA: Natural 20.

03:12:07.162 --> 03:12:07.877
MATT: Okay.

03:12:07.877 --> 03:12:08.591
TALIESIN: 14.

03:12:08.591 --> 03:12:10.317
MATT: 14, so what's the total?

03:12:10.317 --> 03:12:11.545
SAM: 19.

03:12:11.545 --> 03:12:12.130
MATT: Nice.

03:12:12.130 --> 03:12:13.049
LIAM: 14.

03:12:13.049 --> 03:12:15.261
MARISHA: 20, not natural.

03:12:15.261 --> 03:12:17.790
TRAVIS: Ten for Fjord and 19 for Yasha.

03:12:17.790 --> 03:12:18.670
MATT: Okay.

03:12:18.670 --> 03:12:21.059
LAURA: Natural 20 with a total of 24.

03:12:21.059 --> 03:12:31.023
MATT: Okay. Jester, it's a couple of things. You
pick up on the detail of the flag. It is straight

03:12:31.023 --> 03:12:39.182
purple but there is something... different about it,
you're not entirely certain. It looks like a

03:12:39.182 --> 03:12:44.158
straight color, but there's, sometimes, some of
the way the light hits it, you can see a sheen in

03:12:44.158 --> 03:12:49.846
parts of it. That's the best I can describe. The
rest of you also look around and you can see

03:12:49.846 --> 03:12:54.561
amongst these reefs, not only are there the jagged
bits of it that come forward and bits of rock that

03:12:54.561 --> 03:12:58.822
jut out the ocean amongst the rest of the rubble
around, and it looks like a lot of it has been

03:12:58.822 --> 03:13:05.604
placed both as a communal barricade on top of the
reef, and as a challenge to anything that wishes

03:13:05.604 --> 03:13:10.611
to come in, but you can see in areas where the
rock itself is a little more sturdy and above the

03:13:10.611 --> 03:13:17.744
surface, there are watchtowers, and there are
bolt-throwers and catapults, and there are

03:13:17.744 --> 03:13:25.437
defenses all across elements of this reef that you
imagine are one of the many reasons it's not been

03:13:25.437 --> 03:13:31.553
taken back by the Clovis Concord in what you would
know to be the 40-plus years that Darktow has

03:13:31.553 --> 03:13:34.800
belonged to what is known as the Revelry.

03:13:34.800 --> 03:13:36.728
TRAVIS: The Revelry?

03:13:36.728 --> 03:13:44.397
MATT: The Revelry is the communal band of pirates
that work together to maintain some internal

03:13:44.397 --> 03:13:51.958
order. Make a history check, Fjord and anybody
else proficient with history.

03:13:51.958 --> 03:13:53.031
TRAVIS: 17.

03:13:53.031 --> 03:13:54.304
MATT: Okay.

03:13:54.304 --> 03:13:57.017
SAM: The Revelry?

03:13:57.017 --> 03:13:58.517
LIAM: 25.

03:13:58.517 --> 03:14:00.398
MATT: Okay.

03:14:00.398 --> 03:14:01.950
MARISHA: 11.

03:14:01.950 --> 03:14:12.901
MATT: Fjord and Caleb, you know that this began as
a dispute with the heads of the guilds in the

03:14:13.091 --> 03:14:21.564
Clovis Concord. They own and run a majority of the
trade routes that come in and out, but a lot of

03:14:21.564 --> 03:14:31.178
the smaller shipping businesses and various other
side-industry leaders were being over-taxed,

03:14:31.178 --> 03:14:36.880
repeatedly, in an attempt to close them out of the
business and essentially completely own all means

03:14:36.880 --> 03:14:43.899
of shipping in the vicinity. This pissed off a lot
of people, and eventually, in moments of combined

03:14:43.899 --> 03:14:52.259
desperation and frustration, they banded together,
and where Darktow was previously a very important

03:14:52.259 --> 03:14:59.889
repair and stopping station this far out from the
Menagerie Coast for long-distance shipping, they

03:14:59.889 --> 03:15:07.605
ransacked it and took it over. They killed those
that defended themselves, and any of those who did

03:15:07.605 --> 03:15:12.087
not want to raise arms would be absorbed and be
allowed to become a member of what was now called

03:15:12.087 --> 03:15:19.170
the Revelry. As such, they have since held this
location and continued to be the source of piracy

03:15:19.170 --> 03:15:25.492
both for their own wealth and continuation of
well-being, but also as a continuous source of

03:15:25.492 --> 03:15:39.434
aggression and destruction of the otherwise very
prosperous trade that the Clovis Concord runs. You

03:15:39.434 --> 03:15:44.387
do know also that the Revelry is run by what's
called the Plank King.

03:15:44.387 --> 03:15:47.940
MARISHA: That sounds super inviting.

03:15:47.940 --> 03:15:55.340
MATT: The previous one was killed 15 years ago by
the current Plank King, who challenged him. The

03:15:55.572 --> 03:16:08.182
Plank King is known as Wyatt Marinas, and all you
have heard is he is a giant of a man. As you move

03:16:08.182 --> 03:16:16.606
deeper through this channel, the day goes on,
begins to get somewhat dark as you begin to see

03:16:16.606 --> 03:16:26.090
the glittering lights of the southern edge of
Darktow Isle. The cold pulls through, and a light

03:16:26.090 --> 03:16:32.670
rain begins to fall as you approach. This island,
unlike the jungle islands that you've come across

03:16:32.670 --> 03:16:40.340
and a vast majority of the Swavain Islands here
off the Menagerie Coast, is mostly rock and cliff.

03:16:40.340 --> 03:16:46.359
In fact, from what you can see, most of this
island from this perspective is jagged cliff face

03:16:46.359 --> 03:16:53.491
and probably a few hundred feet up is where the
island's even surface even begins. At the base

03:16:53.491 --> 03:17:01.056
around this cliff face you can see a scattered web
of a shipyard, just tangled docks that

03:17:01.056 --> 03:17:06.717
maneuver around containing dozens and dozens of
ships. Across that you see numerous torches that

03:17:06.717 --> 03:17:12.439
mark various intersections where they all meet,
and built into the base of this cliff face, you

03:17:12.439 --> 03:17:19.279
see a number of buildings and windows, all slowly
being lit as the night grows darker and darker.

03:17:19.279 --> 03:17:32.359
This mass of natural-looking, hive-like pirate
city there stands before you. Welcome to Darktow.

03:17:32.359 --> 03:17:33.498
SAM: Darktow!

03:17:33.498 --> 03:17:34.943
MARISHA: Dope.

03:17:34.943 --> 03:17:36.876
TALIESIN: Beautiful.

03:17:36.876 --> 03:17:42.523
MATT: As the ship makes its way to the docks and
eventually comes to a stop, you can see a few

03:17:42.523 --> 03:17:47.887
figures up there at the edge, one of them that
rings a bell as it comes in, and a couple that

03:17:48.153 --> 03:17:53.313
come out to meet Avantika. Steps out, and there's
a couple of hands raised, and go, "Hail,

03:17:53.624 --> 03:17:59.628
"Avantika!" She goes, "We have returned! I know it
has been quite a while, but success and

03:17:59.628 --> 03:18:09.239
"celebration, I believe, are on our lips tonight."
A few of the men come up and look over the crew

03:18:09.239 --> 03:18:13.335
and look over a few of you and take some notes,
and then dart off.

03:18:13.335 --> 03:18:21.029
TRAVIS: Guess we're part of the island now.

03:18:21.029 --> 03:18:23.271
SAM: Are we off the ships yet?

03:18:23.271 --> 03:18:30.304
MATT: The ship now has docked, they're beginning
to take remains of the supplies, the Mistake is

03:18:30.400 --> 03:18:37.554
pulled off onto the other side and Orly and your
other hired crew are looking very wide-eyed and

03:18:37.554 --> 03:18:41.822
confused about what the fuck is going on. You
literally hired a bunch of guys out of--

03:18:41.822 --> 03:18:43.410
TRAVIS: They didn't sign up for that shit!

03:18:43.410 --> 03:18:46.713
MATT: Nicodranas that have now been brought into
a--

03:18:46.713 --> 03:18:48.610
TRAVIS: A month-long journey?

03:18:48.610 --> 03:18:50.106
MATT: Yep.

03:18:50.106 --> 03:18:51.716
MARISHA: Wow. Okay.

03:18:51.716 --> 03:18:54.228
MATT: As you begin to step off the ship--

03:18:54.228 --> 03:18:56.140
TRAVIS: Kill those guys.

03:18:56.140 --> 03:18:59.633
MATT: Jamedi steps off with the rest of you.

03:18:59.633 --> 03:19:01.049
MARISHA: Oh no!

03:19:01.049 --> 03:19:09.012
MATT: Looks to Avantika, and goes up to her and
goes, "You still owe me 50 more gold. I counted

03:19:09.012 --> 03:19:14.749
"what you gave me." She goes, "Oh, my apologies, I
thought I had correctly counted that." She pulls a

03:19:14.749 --> 03:19:22.146
few coins out of her purse and hands it to him.
Counts it himself. "Our business is concluded."

03:19:22.146 --> 03:19:30.048
Looks to the rest of you. "Be careful around this
one. Be safe." He turns and walks into the city.

03:19:30.048 --> 03:19:31.679
LAURA: I liked him.

03:19:31.679 --> 03:19:33.981
SAM: Dead man walking.

03:19:33.981 --> 03:19:37.123
TALIESIN: Complicated feelings.

03:19:37.123 --> 03:19:44.051
SAM: I'm going to get on my hands and knees and
kiss the ground.

03:19:44.051 --> 03:19:52.552
MATT: It is salty with sea splash and cold to the
touch because of the nature of the stone.

03:19:52.552 --> 03:19:53.864
SAM: I love it.

03:19:53.864 --> 03:19:56.723
TRAVIS: I thought for sure Caduceus was going to
give Jamedi a little--

03:19:56.723 --> 03:20:00.021
TALIESIN: He got away quick, yeah, that was not a
good time.

03:20:00.021 --> 03:20:01.972
MATT: No one talked to him over the journey.

03:20:01.972 --> 03:20:02.868
TALIESIN: Nope.

03:20:02.868 --> 03:20:06.893
LAURA: I thought he was on the other ship. I guess
we were switching back and forth between ships?

03:20:06.893 --> 03:20:13.133
MATT: There was a lot of back and forth over the
journey. Avantika turns to the rest, "Crew! It has

03:20:13.133 --> 03:20:20.097
"been a good journey. You have all been very kind.
You have been resolute and Uk'otoa will be proud."

03:20:20.097 --> 03:20:22.218
LAURA and MARISHA: (whispering) Uk'otoa.

03:20:22.218 --> 03:20:27.720
MATT: "Tonight we drink! Come. Let us be off to
The Bloated Cup. The rounds are on me."

03:20:27.720 --> 03:20:30.897
SAM and MARISHA: The Bloated Cup.

03:20:30.897 --> 03:20:34.193
LIAM: (whispering) Uk'otoa.

03:20:34.193 --> 03:20:38.242
MATT: Marius comes around the edge of the--

03:20:38.242 --> 03:20:39.872
TRAVIS: Oh god!

03:20:39.872 --> 03:20:41.577
SAM: (nervous voice) Hi Marius.

03:20:41.577 --> 03:20:43.690
MARISHA: Oh my god, Marius!

03:20:43.690 --> 03:20:46.737
MATT: Of the docks. Yes, remember Marius?

03:20:46.737 --> 03:20:47.205
LIAM: Yes.

03:20:47.205 --> 03:20:48.135
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:20:48.135 --> 03:20:57.439
MATT: Yes. He's like "Okay, don't mean to make
this really-- Where the fuck are we?"

03:20:57.439 --> 03:21:00.809
TRAVIS: We're at the end of the world, my friend.

03:21:00.809 --> 03:21:02.163
MATT: "Okay."

03:21:02.163 --> 03:21:07.349
LAURA: You're a pirate. Ta-da.

03:21:07.349 --> 03:21:09.106
MATT: (nervous sighing)

03:21:09.106 --> 03:21:12.327
TRAVIS: It's going to be time for you to toughen
up a bit. Do you have a pirate face?

03:21:12.327 --> 03:21:15.095
LAURA: It's really good. That's good.

03:21:15.095 --> 03:21:17.090
TRAVIS: Is that a pooping face or--

03:21:17.090 --> 03:21:18.430
MATT: "Both, really."

03:21:18.430 --> 03:21:22.644
TRAVIS: Okay, well, until you find a better one,
that'll do. What's your pirate name?

03:21:22.644 --> 03:21:26.614
MATT: "What should it be?"

03:21:26.614 --> 03:21:32.395
MARISHA: Marius the Mariner. <i>LePual</i>.

03:21:32.395 --> 03:21:33.403
MATT: "Got it."

03:21:33.403 --> 03:21:34.324
MARISHA: Le--

03:21:34.324 --> 03:21:35.413
MATT: "Oh, there's more."

03:21:35.413 --> 03:21:36.347
MARISHA: LePain.

03:21:36.347 --> 03:21:38.391
MATT: "LePual LePain."

03:21:38.391 --> 03:21:43.136
MARISHA: LePual LePuain. I don't know. That's all
I got.

03:21:43.136 --> 03:21:45.058
TALIESIN: That was really good. Do me.

03:21:45.058 --> 03:21:53.445
MARISHA: Oh. Caduceus the... Juices?

03:21:53.445 --> 03:21:54.721
TALIESIN: I like juice.

03:21:54.721 --> 03:22:03.304
MATT: Orly's big turtle hand clasps on the back of
your left shoulder, Beau, and goes "Oh, I kind of

03:22:03.304 --> 03:22:04.807
"like that one."

03:22:04.807 --> 03:22:07.288
MARISHA: How do you mean?

03:22:07.288 --> 03:22:11.176
MATT: "Well, I like juice."

03:22:11.176 --> 03:22:13.239
MARISHA: Okay. Yay. Yeah.

03:22:13.239 --> 03:22:16.195
LAURA: Orly the Swirly.

03:22:16.195 --> 03:22:18.379
SAM: Yeah, that's good.

03:22:18.379 --> 03:22:20.219
MATT: (unsure, uncomfortable humming)

03:22:20.219 --> 03:22:22.833
LAURA: Teach me how to do tattoos that are fancy.

03:22:22.833 --> 03:22:23.966
MATT: "Wait, what?"

03:22:23.966 --> 03:22:27.719
LAURA: Make me your apprentice. Make me your--
bequeath me.

03:22:27.719 --> 03:22:30.639
MATT: "I'm going to need a drink."

03:22:30.639 --> 03:22:33.952
MARISHA: I guess we'll follow?

03:22:33.952 --> 03:22:37.651
MATT: The rest of the crew, looking confused
amongst themselves stick together and they come

03:22:37.651 --> 03:22:48.355
over. One of them, his name would've been-- oh.
Actually no, at this point, this is Gallan.

03:22:48.355 --> 03:22:52.210
Gallan, who has recovered and is--

03:22:52.210 --> 03:22:53.549
LAURA: Fellow carpenter!

03:22:53.549 --> 03:22:58.894
MATT: Yes. Who has become loosely the-- because
he's the only one who was originally on the Mist

03:22:58.894 --> 03:23:03.182
and knows it well-- he's become the den mother of
the other hired crew you've brought into this

03:23:03.182 --> 03:23:10.234
wiley adventure. He comes up and goes, "So. All
these ones."

03:23:10.234 --> 03:23:11.281
TRAVIS: Yeah?

03:23:11.281 --> 03:23:13.831
MATT: "What's the plan?"

03:23:13.831 --> 03:23:17.054
TRAVIS: Did we say there was a plan?

03:23:17.054 --> 03:23:19.816
MARISHA: Mm, do we live with plans?

03:23:19.816 --> 03:23:22.153
TRAVIS: I'm not sure. Did we have a plan?

03:23:22.153 --> 03:23:23.773
MARISHA: We had a vague idea.

03:23:23.773 --> 03:23:25.693
SAM: We hired them for a certain amount of time.

03:23:25.693 --> 03:23:27.980
LAURA: Yeah. We should probably let them go home
eventually.

03:23:27.980 --> 03:23:30.027
TRAVIS: I don't even really remember who they
are.

03:23:30.027 --> 03:23:32.483
TALIESIN: I mean, to be fair, we should let us go
home eventually.

03:23:32.483 --> 03:23:35.276
LAURA: Yeah. Maybe they should stay on the boat.

03:23:35.276 --> 03:23:36.961
SAM: After it's repaired.

03:23:36.961 --> 03:23:40.831
LAURA: Yeah. Then we will take them home
eventually.

03:23:40.831 --> 03:23:42.995
MARISHA: Don't we need to pay them more?

03:23:42.995 --> 03:23:49.178
TRAVIS: No. I think we've brought them to a port
of great business. If they choose to stay here,

03:23:49.178 --> 03:23:54.242
they certainly can. Otherwise, they'll have to
wait until we're leaving again.

03:23:54.242 --> 03:24:04.132
MATT: "I'll ask around." He doesn't seem bothered
by it. He's been here before. Gallan left this

03:24:04.132 --> 03:24:10.104
port on the Mist. But he seems genuinely-- Over
the travel, he's gotten a little bit concerned and

03:24:10.104 --> 03:24:14.869
seems somewhat invested in the new crew you've
hired. He goes and relays that message to

03:24:14.869 --> 03:24:15.625
the rest of them.

03:24:15.625 --> 03:24:16.846
TRAVIS: I'm just scared.

03:24:16.846 --> 03:24:19.010
MARISHA: Whoops.

03:24:19.010 --> 03:24:28.529
MATT: In the meantime, the rest of the crew seems
to have followed suit with Avantika, leaving a few

03:24:28.529 --> 03:24:31.441
crewmen that are just a part of the docks to keep
watch.

03:24:31.441 --> 03:24:35.947
TRAVIS: How guarded or patrolled or monitored are
the docks?

03:24:35.947 --> 03:24:41.390
MATT: Pretty damn well patrolled and monitored.
This is the bread and butter of their business.

03:24:41.390 --> 03:24:47.343
TRAVIS: In this area, are there uniformed patrols
or do you just see well armed--

03:24:47.343 --> 03:24:50.317
LIAM: Muscle is obviously everywhere.

03:24:50.317 --> 03:24:56.151
MATT: You get the sense here, and based on your
history checks, everyone who resides in Darktow is

03:24:56.151 --> 03:24:57.531
a member of the Revelry.

03:24:57.531 --> 03:24:59.183
TRAVIS: Is packing.

03:24:59.183 --> 03:25:02.467
MATT: By the way, you guys are members of The
Revelry.

03:25:02.467 --> 03:25:07.810
MARISHA: So by touching down on the island, you
become a member.

03:25:07.810 --> 03:25:13.708
MATT: Well, by becoming part of Avantika's crew,
coming into port, and having a few individuals

03:25:13.708 --> 03:25:17.751
mark your presence, you imagine that's probably
the case.

03:25:17.751 --> 03:25:19.491
MARISHA: We're a part of The Revelry.

03:25:19.491 --> 03:25:21.927
MATT: Well, what are you guys doing?

03:25:21.927 --> 03:25:23.526
TRAVIS: We're going to follow.

03:25:23.526 --> 03:25:25.993
LIAM: We're going to be following the people who
have been here before.

03:25:25.993 --> 03:25:30.899
TALIESIN: Let's make sure the crew knows that they
should be repairing the ship and we need to be

03:25:30.899 --> 03:25:33.330
ship-shape at some point.

03:25:33.330 --> 03:25:34.277
LAURA: Yeah.

03:25:34.277 --> 03:25:40.998
MARISHA: I don't know if that was the easiest
membership I've ever obtained, or the most

03:25:40.998 --> 03:25:44.911
difficult membership I've ever obtained. It's kind
of hard to say.

03:25:44.911 --> 03:25:50.556
LIAM: Following up on Fjord's question, or Travis'
question, the muscle that we see around us, does

03:25:50.556 --> 03:25:58.162
it look like it's-- are we in Deadwood, or is
there a strong police force of sorts that is

03:25:58.162 --> 03:26:00.382
making sure that shit is not going down
constantly?

03:26:00.382 --> 03:26:02.210
TRAVIS: Something they would wear that would
identify.

03:26:02.210 --> 03:26:06.055
LIAM: Yeah, is there anyone in charge, or is it
just a saloon with cowboys everywhere?

03:26:06.055 --> 03:26:10.799
MATT: It's more the former than the latter, from
the first part. There is no uniformed guard,

03:26:10.799 --> 03:26:12.112
there is no--

03:26:12.112 --> 03:26:14.334
TRAVIS: They're not wearing a hat or a sash.

03:26:14.334 --> 03:26:17.840
TALIESIN: This is golden age of piracy Barbados,
basically. We're in the thick of it.

03:26:17.840 --> 03:26:25.139
MATT: Yeah, the heavy realm of piracy has only
existed for 40-plus years, on this coast.

03:26:25.139 --> 03:26:26.621
TALIESIN: Oh wow, okay!

03:26:26.621 --> 03:26:29.180
MATT: It's still, in some ways, finding its
footing.

03:26:29.180 --> 03:26:38.500
TRAVIS: Oh lord! We all going to die! We'll tell
the crew they can have the evening. They can have

03:26:38.500 --> 03:26:41.885
the evening, we've just been at sea this whole
time, but in the morning, we expect work to

03:26:41.885 --> 03:26:43.746
continue on The Mistake.

03:26:43.746 --> 03:26:46.494
LIAM: Probably the only rule here is "Talk shit,
get hit."

03:26:46.494 --> 03:26:53.258
MATT: Winding through the docks, following the
rest of Avantika's crew, the docks and bridges,

03:26:53.465 --> 03:26:59.761
it's this labyrinth to find your way beyond that
to the stone and rock where you had kissed

03:26:59.761 --> 03:27:11.034
earlier. The city itself is a series of switchback
paths and carved caverns and cave entrances that

03:27:11.034 --> 03:27:16.556
have since been outfitted with pieces of wood,
with windows. Now, at this point, it's pretty much

03:27:16.556 --> 03:27:22.112
pitch black in the sky. What little bit of light
there is from the nearby torch and lantern light

03:27:22.112 --> 03:27:28.805
gives just a hint of the mist that's rolled in
across the outskirts of the island. The only light

03:27:28.805 --> 03:27:34.816
sources you have are those you keep on you, or the
distant glowing smattering of hundreds of fire-lit

03:27:34.816 --> 03:27:42.799
windows, lit from the inside the warm buildings
that make up the city. As you make your way to

03:27:42.799 --> 03:27:54.343
what you assume to be the tavern, The Bloated Cup,
if you will, Avantika's currently standing outside

03:27:54.343 --> 03:28:04.259
talking to somebody. There you see this burly,
rough-looking human man, probably a week and a

03:28:04.259 --> 03:28:10.392
half unshaven, this thick five o'clock shadow.
Grayish curled hair that goes right about

03:28:10.392 --> 03:28:15.713
shoulder-length. It's slicked back, probably with
his fingers to one side, but it's oily enough

03:28:15.713 --> 03:28:22.688
where it stays in place. Looks like he's wearing
an officious coat, and they're currently in the

03:28:22.688 --> 03:28:29.926
middle of a discussion, and she looks over her
shoulder to the rest of you and goes, "Ah, my

03:28:29.926 --> 03:28:36.979
"apologies. There is one bit of business we must
attend to before we can celebrate. The rest of you

03:28:36.979 --> 03:28:46.396
"continue on. My new compatriots, it seems," and
the human figure pipes up and goes, "Word has

03:28:46.396 --> 03:28:52.621
"reached the ears of the Plank King that you've
brought new blood here to Darktow. I imagine these

03:28:52.621 --> 03:28:58.579
"are the new blood based on," and he looks at a
sheet of paper that's handed to him and looks at

03:28:58.579 --> 03:29:04.985
the description that was written, "and he would
appreciate you bringing them to The Throne Roost

03:29:04.985 --> 03:29:07.523
"and have an audience."

03:29:07.523 --> 03:29:10.719
SAM: Who, who are you?

03:29:10.719 --> 03:29:14.498
MATT: "Well, I'm the assistant of the Plank
King."

03:29:14.498 --> 03:29:18.132
SAM: What is your name?

03:29:18.132 --> 03:29:19.818
MATT: "James Tybalt."

03:29:19.818 --> 03:29:33.608
SAM: James Tybalt. Assistant to the Plank King. Do
we need to bring any presents or anything to the

03:29:33.608 --> 03:29:35.753
Plank King when we meet him?

03:29:35.753 --> 03:29:40.915
MATT: "I'm certain he wouldn't argue." He smiles
now. This is the first time you've seen his grin

03:29:40.915 --> 03:29:52.486
and there's, maybe, six or seven teeth. Most of
them are blackening. "I'd recommend y'all follow me."

03:29:52.486 --> 03:29:54.320
SAM: Yes, sir!

03:29:54.320 --> 03:30:09.592
MATT: "You too, Avantika. He wants to check in."
She sighs but gives a smile. "Ipess, bring like

03:30:09.592 --> 03:30:17.673
"500." He starts counting out gold from one of the
chests they had brought with them.

03:30:17.673 --> 03:30:19.869
TRAVIS: We never divvied up that box.

03:30:19.869 --> 03:30:21.048
MATT: No.

03:30:21.048 --> 03:30:22.831
LAURA: No, we didn't.

03:30:22.831 --> 03:30:24.740
SAM: That's for her to do.

03:30:24.740 --> 03:30:28.423
MARISHA: That's for him to do.

03:30:28.423 --> 03:30:32.065
TRAVIS. No. For me to do?

03:30:32.065 --> 03:30:33.343
LAURA: It's the quartermaster.

03:30:33.343 --> 03:30:35.331
MARISHA: It's for the quartermaster. He said divvy
up treasure.

03:30:35.331 --> 03:30:38.230
MATT: That's what quartermasters do.

03:30:38.230 --> 03:30:39.588
SAM: Balls.

03:30:39.588 --> 03:30:43.292
TRAVIS: Yeah, it was intentional, guys. We're
fine.

03:30:43.292 --> 03:30:49.102
MATT: It's all good. The coin is passed over to a
smaller chest and Avantika carries it up under her

03:30:49.102 --> 03:30:59.109
arm. You guys are led to the western side of this
city and then begin climbing up this precarious

03:30:59.109 --> 03:31:03.531
set of winding stairs carved out of the rocky
cliff.

03:31:03.531 --> 03:31:04.713
LAURA: Whoa!

03:31:04.713 --> 03:31:12.039
MATT: Above the city, slick with mist and recent
rain. It looks like the way the wind's hitting,

03:31:12.120 --> 03:31:17.781
the rain isn't hitting the cliff side, but you can
see it passing maybe 15, 20 feet in front of you.

03:31:17.781 --> 03:31:23.823
LAURA: This is precarious, you guys!

03:31:23.823 --> 03:31:34.375
MATT: Partway up this climb, the occasional torch
is now replaced with a wooden pike holding a skull

03:31:34.375 --> 03:31:38.342
or a head at varying stages of decay.

03:31:38.342 --> 03:31:40.270
SAM: I hear rain.

03:31:40.270 --> 03:31:44.677
LAURA: I'm going to put my metal, scary mask on.

03:31:44.677 --> 03:31:47.390
MATT: Okay, you put your metal scary mask on.

03:31:47.390 --> 03:31:49.351
TRAVIS: You feeling at home there, Deucy?

03:31:49.351 --> 03:31:51.123
TALIESIN: This is nice.

03:31:51.123 --> 03:32:00.841
MATT: You're led up further, maybe 250, 300 feet
up this cliff face. Leading you with some of the

03:32:00.841 --> 03:32:05.606
bursts of wind to lean against it to pull across.
The stone stairs themselves vary from two feet

03:32:05.606 --> 03:32:12.896
wide to maybe a foot at times. Looking down over
the edge, you can imagine a few folks have found

03:32:12.896 --> 03:32:20.329
their end with an odd misstep. The stairs finally
stop at a wide stone shelf that overlooks the town

03:32:20.329 --> 03:32:26.925
at about 200 to 300 feet above, the furthermost
edge ending just above the rocky waters of the

03:32:26.925 --> 03:32:36.004
inlet. A cave mouth greets you against the cliff,
warm with firelight. Two watchmen notice you and

03:32:36.004 --> 03:32:44.393
they stand there keeping an eye as a cloaked man
pushes past you to descend from where you came. He

03:32:44.393 --> 03:32:55.020
just pushes past you. Avantika nods to the guards
and shows the chest.

03:32:55.020 --> 03:32:57.981
TRAVIS: The guy that pushes past, what's he look
like? What's he wearing?

03:32:57.981 --> 03:33:00.808
MATT: He's a little ways past you now. Make a
perception check.

03:33:00.808 --> 03:33:03.017
TRAVIS: You can't just let these guys go by!

03:33:03.017 --> 03:33:04.415
SAM: It was just a dude!

03:33:04.415 --> 03:33:05.159
TRAVIS: Nine!

03:33:05.159 --> 03:33:07.062
MARISHA and LAURA: Nein!

03:33:07.062 --> 03:33:12.490
MATT: It's too dark and there's too much rain.
It's hard to make out any details, unfortunately.

03:33:12.490 --> 03:33:21.736
Avantika continues in after showing the chest, the
offering. The rest of you follow?

03:33:21.736 --> 03:33:25.604
LAURA: That is our offering, too. It's all our
offering.

03:33:25.604 --> 03:33:35.898
MATT: As you follow inside, the smell of fine
cooked meats and sauces mingles with wet leather

03:33:35.898 --> 03:33:44.410
and stagnant water. A soft fiddle and squeezebox
duet dances through the evening air, the bardic

03:33:44.410 --> 03:33:52.125
sources atop stools next to a large stone chair
carved from the surrounding rock. Sitting atop the

03:33:52.125 --> 03:34:00.308
throne is a giant of a man; half giant, to be
precise. His dull, gray skin marked with scars,

03:34:00.308 --> 03:34:07.471
his coat long and velvet blue, tattered at the
edges. Plain breeches and boots shift as he

03:34:07.471 --> 03:34:16.889
stands, his eyes cold, shifting with his smile.
Long black curls toppling along the sides of his

03:34:16.889 --> 03:34:25.834
head, past his shoulders, framing his face to
about mid chest. Now, you know this through your

03:34:25.834 --> 03:34:33.640
research and some of you had experiences, for the
most part male goliaths don't have hair, let alone

03:34:33.640 --> 03:34:35.982
such luxurious locks.

03:34:35.982 --> 03:34:38.803
MARISHA: European, British giant shit.

03:34:38.803 --> 03:34:43.712
MATT: As he stands up, a servant enters and leaves
a bowl of somewhat bruised feet-- somewhat bruised

03:34:43.712 --> 03:34:52.328
fruit at the feet of the throne. The large figure
claps his hands once loudly and the music stops,

03:34:52.328 --> 03:35:05.847
coming to a halt. "Deep guests. Avantika. You
bring guests. Welcome, friends, to the Revelry.

03:35:05.847 --> 03:35:12.321
"Come, sit a spell." Two servants all of a sudden
come behind, you hear the scraping of wood against

03:35:12.321 --> 03:35:19.302
stone as two long benches are pressed behind you.
You find yourself awkwardly having to sit on them

03:35:19.302 --> 03:35:26.988
as they creak with your weight. Another bowl of
nuts and somewhat mushy berries is placed in

03:35:26.988 --> 03:35:36.993
Caduceus' hands, a bottle of wine is opened and
handed to Caleb. "My manners, where are they?

03:35:36.993 --> 03:35:48.279
"(chuckles) I am Wyatt Marinas, the Plank King of
Darktow, master of the Revelry."

03:35:48.279 --> 03:35:50.044
LAURA: All hail the king.

03:35:50.044 --> 03:35:55.436
TALIESIN and SAM: All hail the king.

03:35:55.436 --> 03:35:57.020
MARISHA: Hear hear.

03:35:57.020 --> 03:36:01.661
MATT: "And you are?"

03:36:01.661 --> 03:36:15.674
SAM: Oh, yes. We are part of Avantika's crew, but
humble servants in her adventurous adventures. I

03:36:15.674 --> 03:36:26.405
am-- some call me Gilligan, others other names. I
present to you this dried meat of the harpy as a

03:36:26.405 --> 03:36:33.059
present for you. Harpy jerky.

03:36:33.059 --> 03:36:46.845
MATT: Sets it awkwardly on one of the arms of the
stone throne. "Okay, Gilligan. So, Avantika, it

03:36:46.845 --> 03:36:54.761
"seems you took all of these under your wing." She
nods and takes her chest and puts it forward and

03:36:54.761 --> 03:36:59.807
goes, "That is true, and I believe the rest will
introduce themselves here in another moment."

03:36:59.807 --> 03:37:05.568
LAURA: I'm the Little Sapphire. I lift up my-- I'm
the Little Sapphire.

03:37:07.508 --> 03:37:09.698
MATT: (grunt of acknowledgement)

03:37:09.698 --> 03:37:12.363
LIAM: Oh, my name is Philip.

03:37:12.363 --> 03:37:19.841
MARISHA: I'm Beau. Some call me Tracy.

03:37:22.712 --> 03:37:27.840
TRAVIS: I'm Fjord Tusktooth, quartermaster of the
Squalleater.

03:37:27.840 --> 03:37:31.272
TALIESIN: They call me Clay.

03:37:31.272 --> 03:37:47.745
MATT: Yasha just goes, "I'm Yasha." "Well, you've
all come under the banner of the Squalleater. What

03:37:47.745 --> 03:37:52.948
"draws you to a life of piracy? What drives you?"

03:37:52.948 --> 03:37:55.665
SAM: So much!

03:37:55.665 --> 03:38:02.567
TRAVIS: What drives any of us? Necessity. Urgency
for a better life.

03:38:02.567 --> 03:38:05.498
MATT: "All right."

03:38:05.498 --> 03:38:10.517
LAURA: Ships are really cool. We like to steal
things.

03:38:10.517 --> 03:38:18.456
MARISHA: Disdain for organized crime in the
Empire.

03:38:18.456 --> 03:38:23.581
TALIESIN: I serve nature. I'm a maker of fine
graves.

03:38:23.581 --> 03:38:28.871
TRAVIS: (laughs)

03:38:28.871 --> 03:38:30.984
SAM: I just love water so much!

03:38:30.984 --> 03:38:34.519
(laughter)

03:38:34.519 --> 03:38:39.832
SAM: Can't get away from it! Ooh, doggy.

03:38:39.832 --> 03:38:52.190
LIAM: Oh, is this required? Refugee from the
Empire, looking for better life.

03:38:52.190 --> 03:39:02.343
MATT: Looks to Yasha. "I like to punch things?"
Kind of smiles. Looks back over his shoulder,

03:39:02.897 --> 03:39:09.132
"You've got all that, Linus?" And you see off to
the side, in an alcove you weren't looking, you

03:39:09.132 --> 03:39:16.673
see a man, hunched over, who's currently writing
everything down in a book, and sketching, and he's

03:39:16.673 --> 03:39:19.372
paying really close attention to everybody, and is
listening.

03:39:19.372 --> 03:39:21.488
LAURA: (gasps) You draw too?

03:39:21.488 --> 03:39:22.437
TRAVIS: Stenographer.

03:39:22.437 --> 03:39:23.401
MATT: "Yeah."

03:39:23.401 --> 03:39:25.676
LAURA: Do you want to show me some of your
drawings?

03:39:25.676 --> 03:39:26.175
MATT: "No."

03:39:26.175 --> 03:39:29.521
(laughter)

03:39:29.521 --> 03:39:30.686
LAURA: Okay.

03:39:30.686 --> 03:39:39.988
MATT: He's feverishly taking notes and sketching.
You recognize, he's drawing as well as making notes.

03:39:39.988 --> 03:39:46.286
LAURA: I'm going to, definitely, every time he
looks over at me, pose differently, so that he

03:39:46.286 --> 03:39:47.686
gets the best--

03:39:47.686 --> 03:39:55.356
MATT: Okay. "Well, if the captain here vouches for
you, then I trust you won't go causing any

03:39:55.667 --> 03:40:05.016
"trouble. Only law here is no trouble coming
between pirates while within the reef. You cause

03:40:05.016 --> 03:40:11.159
"trouble on land, I judge you. You've seen a few
judged on your way up here."

03:40:11.159 --> 03:40:12.637
MARISHA: Oh yeah.

03:40:12.637 --> 03:40:16.477
TALIESIN: We did? Oh, yeah.

03:40:16.477 --> 03:40:23.428
MATT: "Trouble outside the reef, well, you'll
either return to explain your cases, and I decide

03:40:23.428 --> 03:40:32.537
"what's fair, or in need of punishment, or if you
don't return, I just assume you're guilty. Them's

03:40:32.537 --> 03:40:34.571
"the big ones, you understand?"

03:40:34.571 --> 03:40:40.069
LAURA: Does this just include harming other
pirates, or stealing from them too?

03:40:40.069 --> 03:40:47.364
MATT: "Depends on what the other one thinks. If
the other one doesn't want to be harmed or stolen

03:40:47.364 --> 03:40:50.353
"from, well, that's breaking the law."

03:40:50.353 --> 03:40:51.780
LAURA: Got it.

03:40:51.780 --> 03:40:55.995
TRAVIS: What if the other one isn't around to
lodge a complaint?

03:40:55.995 --> 03:41:10.892
MATT: "Well, hard for me to hear that you broke
it. Now, Darktow means protection, means family.

03:41:10.892 --> 03:41:20.574
"And family shares its good fortune." He looks to
Avantika, and she now kicks the chest across, and

03:41:20.574 --> 03:41:26.005
scrapes. He stops it with his foot, and kicks open
the lid and the coins are there now, visible, a

03:41:26.005 --> 03:41:37.841
couple spilling out. "I accept your tribute.
Welcome back. We'll get your ships up and fixed

03:41:37.841 --> 03:41:46.844
"real soon. Welcome to the Revelry. (laughs)."

03:41:46.844 --> 03:41:51.513
(uneasy laughter)

03:41:51.513 --> 03:41:55.820
MATT: "You all sorry lot, you've certainly shacked
up with one of the craziest lasses of the Swavain

03:41:55.820 --> 03:41:58.488
"Islands, that's for sure."

03:41:58.488 --> 03:42:00.250
LAURA: She's crazy all right.

03:42:00.250 --> 03:42:08.313
MATT: "A damn dream-chaser, she be. So be warned
where she leads you: she's crazy. Fucking nuts."

03:42:08.313 --> 03:42:10.075
LAURA: I thought that the entire time.

03:42:10.075 --> 03:42:10.882
SAM: Yeah.

03:42:10.882 --> 03:42:20.027
MATT: She looks up at him and goes, "You are quite
the peach yourself, there, master." Squints to

03:42:20.027 --> 03:42:26.999
himself. "Well, thanks, that's it, shove off. Get
the fuck out of my room."

03:42:26.999 --> 03:42:35.765
SAM: May I just ask, this Linus person over there,
are they just writing everything down that we say?

03:42:35.765 --> 03:42:38.259
MATT: "Yes."

03:42:38.259 --> 03:42:43.526
LAURA: Balls tits mother-bitch, I love dogs and
poop.

03:42:43.526 --> 03:42:46.850
(laughter)

03:42:46.850 --> 03:42:50.592
MATT: He's glaring over at you.

03:42:50.592 --> 03:42:52.669
TRAVIS: (gibberish)

03:42:52.669 --> 03:42:55.807
(laughter)

03:42:55.807 --> 03:43:02.774
TALIESIN: We should take our leave.

03:43:02.774 --> 03:43:08.547
SAM: I guess so, we're going to go just enjoy your
fine place now, thank you for having us.

03:43:08.547 --> 03:43:09.667
MATT: "Of course."

03:43:09.667 --> 03:43:11.914
MARISHA: Do you have a favorite cocktail at the
Bloated Cup?

03:43:11.914 --> 03:43:13.525
TRAVIS: Or a favorite spot.

03:43:13.525 --> 03:43:14.916
MARISHA: A brew, or--

03:43:14.916 --> 03:43:17.546
MATT: "No, I have my drinks brought up here."

03:43:17.546 --> 03:43:22.961
MARISHA: Right, course you do. All right, bye.

03:43:22.961 --> 03:43:32.580
MATT: As Avantika leaves, the rest of you are
leaving. Takes his arms and pushes you out,

03:43:32.580 --> 03:43:34.318
leading you to the exit.

03:43:34.318 --> 03:43:39.168
TRAVIS: Just the Plank King and Linus in that
room, outside from Avantika?

03:43:39.168 --> 03:43:41.750
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:43:41.750 --> 03:43:44.300
TRAVIS: 17.

03:43:44.300 --> 03:43:55.082
MATT: 17. Couple of things you notice. One: you
glance in the vicinity, you look and notice the

03:43:55.082 --> 03:44:09.541
Plank King. Right where the hairline is, it's a
duller, paler white. In that moment you remember

03:44:09.541 --> 03:44:15.592
the first Plank King was definitely known for his
longer, darker locks.

03:44:15.592 --> 03:44:19.007
(groaning)

03:44:19.007 --> 03:44:20.114
TALIESIN: That's metal.

03:44:20.114 --> 03:44:22.343
TRAVIS: It puts the lotion in the basket.

03:44:22.343 --> 03:44:24.985
TALIESIN: That's some metal shit.

03:44:24.985 --> 03:44:29.127
MATT: Looking around the interior of the chamber,
because the way this is carved inside the

03:44:29.127 --> 03:44:35.087
mountain, it's this nice arched cavern top and
there are number of alcoves and hidden spaces, and

03:44:35.087 --> 03:44:40.458
you glance around it and first, at just a quick
glance, notice at least six or seven other figures

03:44:40.458 --> 03:44:42.930
that are hidden in the alcoves, just watching.

03:44:42.930 --> 03:44:47.005
TRAVIS: Creatures?

03:44:47.005 --> 03:44:51.090
MATT: Figures. Seem to be either human or--

03:44:51.090 --> 03:44:52.846
MARISHA: Roof snipers.

03:44:52.846 --> 03:44:55.025
TRAVIS: (whispers) Statues.

03:44:55.025 --> 03:44:59.675
MATT: As you're all being ushered out of the
chamber and pushed to the side, the Plank King is

03:44:59.891 --> 03:45:06.740
like, "Anyway, off with you! Enjoy your night,
drink well. We'll take care of that," and there's

03:45:06.740 --> 03:45:14.141
a little tug on your arm, Beau. The Plank King
comes and whispers in the side of your ear. He

03:45:14.141 --> 03:45:23.240
says, "You've a keen ear, right? Avantika ever
does anything untoward to our little community

03:45:23.240 --> 03:45:28.172
"here, you let me know. There's some grand coin in
it for you."

03:45:28.172 --> 03:45:29.621
MARISHA: How much?

03:45:29.621 --> 03:45:31.327
MATT: Just backs away.

03:45:31.327 --> 03:45:37.878
MARISHA: I yank away from him. Move on.

03:45:37.878 --> 03:45:39.130
MATT: Okay.

03:45:39.130 --> 03:45:40.922
SAM: She's a snitch.

03:45:40.922 --> 03:45:46.181
TALIESIN: Can tell you're a snitch. Can tell at 50
feet. Of course you're a snitch.

03:45:46.181 --> 03:45:48.168
(laughter)

03:45:48.168 --> 03:45:49.601
MARISHA: Am I that transparent?

03:45:49.601 --> 03:45:50.438
TALIESIN: You are.

03:45:50.438 --> 03:45:51.672
TRAVIS: You said, "How much?"

03:45:51.672 --> 03:46:00.500
TALIESIN: You sit in the bathroom stall with your
legs raised, with a notebook.

03:46:00.500 --> 03:46:08.501
MATT: With that, you make your way out, back to
the stone steps. Avantika sees you all exit and

03:46:08.501 --> 03:46:14.657
goes, "Well, that was harrowing and necessary, but
over. Now for drinking, yes?"

03:46:14.657 --> 03:46:18.694
TRAVIS: Indeed. He seems like quite the benevolent
leader.

03:46:18.694 --> 03:46:22.868
MATT: "He's certainly a series of adjectives, yes,
I'll give you that."

03:46:22.868 --> 03:46:26.555
TRAVIS: How long has he been in a seat of rule?

03:46:26.555 --> 03:46:30.611
MATT: "Well over a decade, probably."

03:46:30.611 --> 03:46:35.640
MARISHA: How much on average do you pay him to not
kill you?

03:46:35.640 --> 03:46:42.142
MATT: "Oh, well, it's not paying him to not kill
us, it's sharing in our spoils to better the community."

03:46:42.142 --> 03:46:44.732
MARISHA: And if you didn't share your spoils?

03:46:44.732 --> 03:46:47.672
MATT: "I don't know. I've never tried."

03:46:47.672 --> 03:46:49.629
MARISHA: Right.

03:46:49.629 --> 03:46:52.621
LAURA: He has beautiful hair.

03:46:52.621 --> 03:46:54.008
SAM: It's awesome, yeah.

03:46:54.008 --> 03:46:55.649
TALIESIN: Very. It's lush.

03:46:55.649 --> 03:46:57.531
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's something.

03:46:57.531 --> 03:47:02.982
MATT: "Nevertheless, I'm going to get drunk. Who's
with me?"

03:47:02.982 --> 03:47:04.985
SAM: Hear hear, let's go.

03:47:04.985 --> 03:47:06.746
TALIESIN: I will follow.

03:47:06.746 --> 03:47:10.856
MATT: "All right, come on." She smiles and turns
around and you all begin to make your trek down

03:47:10.856 --> 03:47:18.206
the somewhat slick stone steps to the darkened
city of Darktow, the glittering firelight, the

03:47:18.206 --> 03:47:24.197
open windows below leading you to whatever revelry
the evening has in store. And that's where we'll

03:47:24.197 --> 03:47:24.953
pick up next week.

03:47:24.953 --> 03:47:28.123
TRAVIS: (yells) Oh god, we're on pirate island!

03:47:28.123 --> 03:47:29.904
SAM: How did this happen?

03:47:29.904 --> 03:47:31.248
LAURA: It's so cool, though.

03:47:31.248 --> 03:47:34.092
MATT: You a stole a ship and followed the path!

03:47:34.092 --> 03:47:37.540
TRAVIS: We're surrounded by a reef and artillery
and pirates!

03:47:37.540 --> 03:47:41.368
LAURA: We were going in a completely different
direction and now we're pirates!

03:47:41.368 --> 03:47:44.746
TRAVIS: He's wearing somebody's scalp, you guys.

03:47:44.746 --> 03:47:50.636
MARISHA: There's a war on another continent, and
we're not a part of it.

03:47:50.636 --> 03:47:52.617
TALIESIN: I am so proud of you all.

03:47:52.617 --> 03:47:58.574
SAM: I will say this, though: In comparison to
these folks, we're not so bad. We're not that bad.

03:47:58.574 --> 03:48:00.979
MATT: It is a point of comparison, this is true.

03:48:00.979 --> 03:48:03.259
TRAVIS: We're in the main of other creatures.

03:48:03.259 --> 03:48:05.904
LIAM: Guys, we're the heroes here.

03:48:05.904 --> 03:48:08.144
LAURA: Yeah, yeah. Wow.

03:48:08.144 --> 03:48:14.411
TRAVIS: Good shit, Matt, good shit, Matt!

03:48:14.411 --> 03:48:17.869
MATT: Well guys, this is a very unique flavor of
campaign.

03:48:17.869 --> 03:48:20.563
TALIESIN: The Plank King is cool.

03:48:20.563 --> 03:48:32.672
MATT: "He's a fun one." On that note, folks, we're
going to pick this up next Thursday. Look forward

03:48:32.672 --> 03:48:40.426
to the art book coming on sale Monday morning, the
final chapters, the second half and end of Vox

03:48:40.426 --> 03:48:49.319
Machina's campaign, as created and presented by
you, the fantastic art community. Yeah, other than

03:48:49.319 --> 03:48:54.932
that, have a wonderful weekend, we love you, and
is it Thursday yet? Goodnight, guys.

03:48:54.932 --> 03:48:56.879
(wolf whistle)

03:48:56.879 --> 03:48:59.136
TRAVIS: Oh, the fucking hat!

03:48:59.136 --> 04:00:48.421
