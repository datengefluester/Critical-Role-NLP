1
00:00:00,261 --> 00:00:04,952
MATT: --and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical
Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

2
00:00:04,952 --> 00:00:11,274
play Dungeons &amp; Dragons and point to Liam O'Brien
for the evening, you motherfucker.

3
00:00:11,274 --> 00:00:13,330
MARISHA: That's the winner!

4
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,710
(laughter)

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,972
MATT: So for those of you who are tuning in for
the first time, welcome to the chaos. We have a

6
00:00:20,972 --> 00:00:25,456
fun continuation of a very fun story line, but
before we get to that, let's go ahead and get

7
00:00:25,456 --> 00:00:30,748
through our announcements for the evening. First
and foremost, once again, we thank last week's

8
00:00:30,748 --> 00:00:33,878
sponsor Backblaze but today brings back Loot Crate
once again!

9
00:00:33,878 --> 00:00:36,271
ALL: Loot Crate! (cheering)

10
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:38,865
(air horns)

11
00:00:38,865 --> 00:00:41,727
MATT: Sam, why don't you tell us all about it?

12
00:00:41,727 --> 00:00:45,134
SAM: Loot Crate, guys. (clears throat) Okay, so
here's the thing--

13
00:00:45,134 --> 00:00:46,792
TALIESIN: No notes! Flying without a net!

14
00:00:46,792 --> 00:00:51,962
SAM: Oh, don't worry, I'll come up with something.
Loot Crate, guys. They gave us some great

15
00:00:51,962 --> 00:00:57,634
information about their next month's theme, which
they're going to announce on the 26th, which is

16
00:00:57,634 --> 00:01:02,786
Monday. They didn't tell us what the theme was,
but that's the exciting part, because now we get

17
00:01:02,786 --> 00:01:10,886
to speculate. I've prepared three ideas for what
next month's Loot Crate theme might be. Just

18
00:01:10,886 --> 00:01:17,484
spitballing here. Number one: Screws and Nails.
It's just a box of screws and nails. You got your

19
00:01:17,484 --> 00:01:22,575
wood screws, you got your metal screws, your
two-inchers, your one-inchers. Pretty cheap to

20
00:01:22,575 --> 00:01:23,434
produce.

21
00:01:23,434 --> 00:01:24,506
MATT: Thoughtful!

22
00:01:24,506 --> 00:01:30,348
SAM: Yeah, and useful! Number two: Storks! The
theme is Storks, the movie Storks that's out this

23
00:01:30,348 --> 00:01:36,159
week. It includes a handwritten letter from Andy
Samberg, trying to beg you to go to see the

24
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,324
movie.

25
00:01:37,324 --> 00:01:38,872
(laughter)

26
00:01:38,872 --> 00:01:43,945
SAM: And one baby stork. No instructions on how to
care for it. You just have to deal with it.

27
00:01:43,945 --> 00:01:47,223
Storks! In theaters now.

28
00:01:47,223 --> 00:01:49,447
TALIESIN: Is that actually a real movie?

29
00:01:49,447 --> 00:01:54,801
SAM: Yeah, it is out now. Storks, animated film.

30
00:01:54,801 --> 00:01:58,744
MATT: I still think Stork Patrol's the best Andy
Samberg-related stork thing that's ever happened.

31
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:05,026
SAM: And number three-- this is what the theme for
Loot Crate could be, announced on Monday. It could

32
00:02:05,026 --> 00:02:11,797
be 50 Shades of Grey. They give you a ball gag,
some can [no audio], and your own personalized

33
00:02:11,797 --> 00:02:17,216
safe word. Mine is "harder, baby, harder," which
is very confusing.

34
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,473
(laughter)

35
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:23,709
SAM: Those are my ideas for what could be
announced on Monday, and whatever it is, when it

36
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:28,992
is announced, go online, subscribe, use the code
"CRITICALROLE" to get three dollars off your

37
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:32,225
subscription. Loot Crate, we love them, no matter
what the theme is.

38
00:02:32,225 --> 00:02:34,183
TRAVIS: (laughs) Holy shit.

39
00:02:34,183 --> 00:02:41,434
MATT: I feel like we should put a Twitter poll up
at some point about which of those three we all

40
00:02:41,434 --> 00:02:43,009
believe it might be.

41
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:44,629
TALIESIN: Let's make a poll.

42
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:46,924
SAM: I'm going to do that right now.

43
00:02:46,924 --> 00:02:49,820
MATT: Yeah. (laughs) Next announcement--

44
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:55,854
MARISHA: That's going to be the next show I
produce. "Let's Make a Poll" with Sam Riegel. Keep

45
00:02:55,854 --> 00:02:56,818
going.

46
00:02:56,818 --> 00:02:58,288
MATT: Marisha, you want to talk about the new
host--

47
00:02:58,288 --> 00:02:59,643
MARISHA: Speaking of shows I produce!

48
00:02:59,643 --> 00:03:01,339
(cheering)

49
00:03:01,339 --> 00:03:03,463
MARISHA: What's up! Look at that segue.

50
00:03:03,463 --> 00:03:05,422
TALIESIN: That was slightly less awkward than a
real Segway.

51
00:03:05,422 --> 00:03:14,089
MARISHA: Right? Am I right? So Signal Boost is
back! It never went away, you didn't realize that,

52
00:03:14,089 --> 00:03:15,278
but it's back.

53
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,793
(laughter)

54
00:03:16,793 --> 00:03:17,880
TALIESIN: It feels like it went away.

55
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,303
MARISHA: It feels like it went away. It did not!
You just forgot about it, it's back with Damion

56
00:03:21,303 --> 00:03:27,917
Poitier. He's awesome. He was Thanos, the first
Thanos before he got replaced because celebrities

57
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:29,489
are dicks. And--

58
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:32,117
TALIESIN: Except for the ones who come on our
show.

59
00:03:32,117 --> 00:03:36,041
MARISHA: Right, he was also Chains in Payday,
which is what everyone has been now shouting at us

60
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,417
through Twitter.

61
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:40,217
TRAVIS: He was in Civil War as the guy that gets
killed by a cop.

62
00:03:40,217 --> 00:03:46,264
MARISHA: He was. He gets killed in Civil War--
Technically tranquilized. Apparently, is what he

63
00:03:46,264 --> 00:03:48,758
clarified. Anyway--

64
00:03:48,758 --> 00:03:52,700
MATT: Tranquilized, in a Spielberg ET
walkie-talkie gun replacement world, he was

65
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,831
"tranquilized."

66
00:03:53,831 --> 00:04:01,208
MARISHA: Other than being Chains being on social
media, people have also shouted he's very

67
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:07,583
attractive and sexy, so maybe that's a selling
point for you. So you should go watch it. It's out

68
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:12,697
right now, his second episode is out this past
Tuesday. Go watch him! He's funny, he's very

69
00:04:12,697 --> 00:04:13,743
charming.

70
00:04:13,743 --> 00:04:14,742
MATT: Awesome!

71
00:04:14,742 --> 00:04:15,993
TALIESIN: He has great shirts.

72
00:04:15,993 --> 00:04:17,827
MATT: Laura, did you have an update in regards to
the--

73
00:04:17,827 --> 00:04:18,733
LAURA: Merchandise.

74
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:21,473
MARISHA: (sings) Merchandise!

75
00:04:21,473 --> 00:04:26,904
LAURA: I've been organizing my dice while you guys
were talking and so now I'm set. In the store, we

76
00:04:26,904 --> 00:04:29,959
have things available for you to buy. And--

77
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:31,425
LIAM: What are they?

78
00:04:31,425 --> 00:04:36,745
LAURA: I'm not as good at this as Sam is. Okay, so
the rings: there's two sizes left. There's six and

79
00:04:36,745 --> 00:04:41,841
seven. So if you have little itty-bitty fingers,
you can still get one. The patches are out of

80
00:04:41,841 --> 00:04:47,104
stock, sorry people, but I'm proud of everybody
that got one. The nail wraps are still there, the

81
00:04:47,104 --> 00:04:53,378
mugs are still there and the pins and the
wristbands that Travis is wearing right now--

82
00:04:53,378 --> 00:04:54,671
TRAVIS: I sleep in this.

83
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:59,004
LAURA: Those are available for pre-order for one
more day as of 5:00pm, I think our time?

84
00:04:59,004 --> 00:05:01,686
California time? They're going to be out of the
store.

85
00:05:01,686 --> 00:05:03,813
TRAVIS: And it's legit. Mine smells like a cast.

86
00:05:03,813 --> 00:05:11,416
LAURA: He's been wearing it every day. It does
not-- It doesn't smell that bad!

87
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:13,417
TALIESIN: Casts just smell like you after a
while.

88
00:05:13,417 --> 00:05:15,469
TRAVIS: The nail wraps are limited too.

89
00:05:15,469 --> 00:05:18,798
LAURA: Yeah I know! The nail wraps-- only some, a
few left in stock.

90
00:05:18,798 --> 00:05:20,642
LIAM: Go get 'em. You got to go get 'em.

91
00:05:20,642 --> 00:05:26,104
MARISHA: The guys like to get 'em and put them on
their middle fingers, so that you can flick off--

92
00:05:26,104 --> 00:05:27,516
MATT: How do you want to do this?

93
00:05:27,516 --> 00:05:29,484
LAURA: That's good.

94
00:05:29,484 --> 00:05:32,410
TALIESIN: I've got mine for a Disney trip later
this week.

95
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,373
MARISHA: Oh, nice, the patchwork ones? Those are
good.

96
00:05:34,373 --> 00:05:40,651
SAM: Guys, so far, Storks is just eking out 50
Shades of Grey and Nails &amp; Screws. It's tight now.

97
00:05:40,651 --> 00:05:44,994
It's 32%, 32% and 36%.

98
00:05:44,994 --> 00:05:46,707
TALIESIN: That's real close.

99
00:05:46,707 --> 00:05:52,049
MATT: We'll have further updates after tonight's
episode on this. Just riding that wave of interest

100
00:05:52,049 --> 00:05:57,691
and tension. Well great! Do we have anything else
we need to announce, or is that the end of our--?

101
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:03,080
I think we're good! All right! That being the
case, let's go ahead and dive into tonight's

102
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,030
episode of Critical Role.

103
00:06:06,030 --> 00:07:37,790
[dramatic music]

104
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:47,683
MATT: Welcome back. So to dive into this evening's
episode of Critical Role. Our band of adventurers,

105
00:07:47,683 --> 00:07:51,665
Vox Machina, have been in search of the Vestiges
of Divergence, a series of powerful artifacts that

106
00:07:51,665 --> 00:07:55,992
they will utilize in the coming battle with the
Chroma Conclave, a collection of dangerous

107
00:07:55,992 --> 00:08:01,249
chromatic dragons that have torn through the
countryside of Tal'Dorei and beyond. You felled

108
00:08:01,249 --> 00:08:08,116
two of the dragons, one long ago and one
relatively recently, named Umbrasyl. You've

109
00:08:08,116 --> 00:08:16,296
briefly passed by Vorugal, the white dragon, and
Thordak still sits among-- on top of Emon, with

110
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:22,826
Raishan somewhere in the wind. You made your way
to the distant continent of Marquet, eventually to

111
00:08:22,826 --> 00:08:29,199
the city of Ank'Harel, where you began seeking
another Vestige, known as Cabal's Ruin. After some

112
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:36,876
fun casino games and losing some money on some
drug deals, you discovered that the owner of

113
00:08:36,876 --> 00:08:45,855
Cabal's Ruin was found killed, wounds referring
to, or pointing toward some sort of bullet entry

114
00:08:45,855 --> 00:08:52,141
and exit points and a woman matching the
description of one Dr. Anna Ripley having left

115
00:08:52,215 --> 00:08:57,968
but a week before, the cloak nowhere to be seen.
Through a couple of Scry attempts, you managed to

116
00:08:57,968 --> 00:09:04,285
see that she, with her own band of bodyguards, was
currently heading north through the ocean via

117
00:09:04,285 --> 00:09:11,115
ship, towards something in the distance which you
found to be an island made, or is now currently

118
00:09:11,115 --> 00:09:16,734
covered in, shards of broken glass, known as
Glintshore, as part of the Hespit Archipelago. You

119
00:09:16,734 --> 00:09:23,018
guys manage to, through your influence and
discussion, attain a skyship.

120
00:09:23,018 --> 00:09:25,761
SAM: Who knew?

121
00:09:25,761 --> 00:09:30,729
MATT: Who knew? With Captain Damon, who had
previously taken you guys to Vasselheim long ago.

122
00:09:30,729 --> 00:09:35,727
You, through the druidic mastery of Keyleth, tore
through a storm that would have slowed your

123
00:09:35,727 --> 00:09:45,192
arrival, seemingly forcing an earlier arrival than
expected from the team at Glintshore. You guys

124
00:09:45,192 --> 00:09:51,925
went into full-on Avengers mode and tore into
their ship, destroying it in the bay outside of

125
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:58,589
Glintshore, swooped down onto the edge of the dark
glass- and soot-covered beach and you now are all

126
00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:06,413
gathering the scenery around you as to what your
next point in this aggressive maneuver is. So at

127
00:10:06,413 --> 00:10:11,437
this point in time, you've all gathered along the
eastern beach of Glintshore. Grog, you are still

128
00:10:11,437 --> 00:10:19,712
an eagle, a giant eagle, polymorphed by Scanlan.
You have your wings out still. You guys have flown

129
00:10:19,712 --> 00:10:28,034
about and you've seen the remnants of some sort of
small campsite, with a faint ember still burning

130
00:10:28,034 --> 00:10:31,292
and giving off a hint of smoke, but it's been
a while since it's been utilized.

131
00:10:31,292 --> 00:10:32,613
LAURA: We said like five hours is what I--

132
00:10:32,613 --> 00:10:38,102
MATT: About five hours. You just got there and
checked it right now. We'll get into the more

133
00:10:38,102 --> 00:10:46,335
specifics of that here in a moment. So we have
currently, if I recall, Grog as an eagle, Scanlan,

134
00:10:46,335 --> 00:10:51,647
and who else is in the center of the beach area
between the actual shoreline and the jungle?

135
00:10:51,647 --> 00:10:53,551
MARISHA: I'm just showing up on the beach.

136
00:10:53,551 --> 00:10:56,208
TALIESIN: I was also on the beach.

137
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,226
LIAM: I thought we were en route when we ended.

138
00:10:58,226 --> 00:11:00,254
MARISHA: We had just landed.

139
00:11:00,254 --> 00:11:08,188
MATT: You guys had just gotten there. Yeah, so we
have, in between the shoreline and the tree line,

140
00:11:08,188 --> 00:11:16,256
the mostly dead, petrified trees, gray in the
distance. We have the two of you and the rest of

141
00:11:16,256 --> 00:11:18,919
you currently are now gathering at the beach at
the campsite.

142
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:20,531
LAURA: I pop Trinket out.

143
00:11:20,531 --> 00:11:26,262
MATT: Okay, Trinket (growls) looks around,
immediately looks down at a paw with a piece of

144
00:11:26,262 --> 00:11:27,749
glass sticking out of it.

145
00:11:27,749 --> 00:11:31,389
LAURA: Aw, buddy. You're tough.

146
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:41,106
MATT: So you see there are two small boats that
are currently pulled up onto the shore, just

147
00:11:41,106 --> 00:11:47,720
outside, slightly north of this campsite. There is
a tousled blanket that is somewhat dirty, with a small

148
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:53,567
pack that was pushed in the side, the leftover
campfire and some sort of movement, like something

149
00:11:53,567 --> 00:12:01,258
heavy had been pulled from the water into the
campsite and somewhere else from within. Do you

150
00:12:01,258 --> 00:12:03,514
wish to continue to inspect the campsite?

151
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:08,760
LAURA: Do we see any tracks? Are there tracks able
to be left on the glass?

152
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:15,694
MATT: Make an investigation-- for this, for you,
are you just inspecting for details? Or are you

153
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:16,926
trying to track?

154
00:12:16,926 --> 00:12:18,706
LAURA: I'm trying to see where the people went.

155
00:12:18,706 --> 00:12:24,600
MATT: Okay, make a survival check to see if you
can follow any tracks. What are other people doing

156
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,720
at the campsite?

157
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,880
TALIESIN: I want to check the boat.

158
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,604
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check.

159
00:12:28,604 --> 00:12:29,477
TALIESIN: New die.

160
00:12:29,477 --> 00:12:30,980
LAURA: Survival? 18.

161
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,714
MATT: Okay. What'd you get?

162
00:12:33,714 --> 00:12:35,339
TALIESIN: I got an eight.

163
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:40,367
MATT: Okay. They're boats. They're made of wood.

164
00:12:40,367 --> 00:12:42,335
TALIESIN: I tousle the blanket aside.

165
00:12:42,335 --> 00:12:46,303
MATT: Yeah. There's two blankets that are folded
in there.

166
00:12:46,303 --> 00:12:48,633
LIAM: What's in that pack?

167
00:12:48,633 --> 00:12:50,034
TALIESIN: What pack?

168
00:12:50,034 --> 00:12:52,352
LIAM: There was a pack in the bag.

169
00:12:52,352 --> 00:12:53,537
TALIESIN: Is there a pack in the bag?

170
00:12:53,537 --> 00:12:58,055
MATT: Yes, your low roll investigation allowed you
to completely miss that there was a pack on the

171
00:12:58,055 --> 00:13:03,371
side of the blankets. You go to inspect it. You
check and see that there are a number of footfalls

172
00:13:03,371 --> 00:13:05,268
in this area clustered--

173
00:13:05,268 --> 00:13:06,638
TALIESIN: I'm not at my best.

174
00:13:06,638 --> 00:13:12,108
MATT: --sporadically, it looks like some of them
seem to be with haste, some are dragging, like,

175
00:13:12,108 --> 00:13:17,940
heavy-- the heels are pushed in deep. And you see
a large, heavy groove that was pulled to the

176
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:21,200
campsite and has pulled further and further inland
towards the treeline.

177
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,510
LAURA: Okay.

178
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,165
MATT: What are you guys doing right now?

179
00:13:24,165 --> 00:13:25,717
SAM: I'm going to mount Grog.

180
00:13:25,717 --> 00:13:28,636
TRAVIS: Thank god. It's been so long.

181
00:13:28,636 --> 00:13:34,015
SAM: And say, Let's go scan around the tree line,
friend. Fly! Fly!

182
00:13:34,015 --> 00:13:39,843
TRAVIS: Then I take off in my bird form, admiring
the ar<i>ch</i>-ipelago but I have an intelligence of

183
00:13:39,843 --> 00:13:42,561
eight and realize it's ar<i>k</i>-ipelago.

184
00:13:42,561 --> 00:13:45,398
MATT: (laughs) You're such a dick.

185
00:13:45,398 --> 00:13:47,643
TRAVIS: And I head for the treeline.

186
00:13:47,643 --> 00:13:50,970
MATT: All right, you guys take off over the
treeline. Make a perception check, both of you.

187
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,576
And you have advantage, Grog.

188
00:13:52,576 --> 00:13:53,785
TRAVIS: I do?

189
00:13:53,785 --> 00:13:55,044
SAM: You're an eagle.

190
00:13:55,044 --> 00:13:58,312
LAURA: What do your eagle eyes see, Grog?

191
00:13:58,312 --> 00:14:00,516
TRAVIS: Not shit, apparently.

192
00:14:00,516 --> 00:14:05,078
LAURA: What's the possibility that Ripley can make
herself invisible?

193
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:07,019
LIAM: 50-50?

194
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:09,158
TALIESIN: I legitimately have no idea.

195
00:14:09,158 --> 00:14:10,364
SAM: One.

196
00:14:10,364 --> 00:14:11,509
MATT: A one.

197
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:14,205
SAM: With my brand-new awesome d20.

198
00:14:14,205 --> 00:14:15,912
TRAVIS: 16.

199
00:14:15,912 --> 00:14:24,476
MATT: Okay, you swoop up over the tree line and do
a couple of scans over the-- while the trees, many

200
00:14:24,476 --> 00:14:28,322
of them are dead, you do see there are a few
peeking bits of green. It looks like even in the

201
00:14:28,322 --> 00:14:35,013
midst of this barren landscape, elements of nature
have still managed to push through here and there.

202
00:14:35,013 --> 00:14:40,364
Little dappled, peppering of green. But the canopy
itself is still too thick for you to make out any

203
00:14:40,364 --> 00:14:44,055
details from above. That's as much as you can make
out.

204
00:14:44,055 --> 00:14:46,522
TRAVIS: Petri-fried trees or are they scorched?

205
00:14:46,522 --> 00:14:52,571
MATT: Both. It looks like a lot of it is burnt
black, but some of it also looks like the wood

206
00:14:52,571 --> 00:14:56,770
itself has been dead for so long that it's become a
dull grey, hardened exterior.

207
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:00,408
LAURA: It sounded like you said "petri-fried".

208
00:15:00,408 --> 00:15:01,513
TRAVIS: I did.

209
00:15:01,513 --> 00:15:02,537
MATT: Petri-fried.

210
00:15:02,537 --> 00:15:03,849
TRAVIS: Petri-fried. Entire State Building.

211
00:15:03,849 --> 00:15:07,325
TALIESIN: Turns into stone, it's deep-battered,
covered in cheese.

212
00:15:07,325 --> 00:15:08,982
SAM: You didn't see anything, Groggy?

213
00:15:08,982 --> 00:15:10,329
TRAVIS: (squawks)

214
00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:11,921
SAM: Guess not.

215
00:15:11,921 --> 00:15:13,991
TALIESIN: Scanlan, I may borrow you for a second.

216
00:15:13,991 --> 00:15:15,423
SAM: I'm in the air, you can't talk to me.

217
00:15:15,423 --> 00:15:17,365
TALIESIN: I have an earpiece, damn it!

218
00:15:17,365 --> 00:15:19,304
SAM: I'm on an [no audio].

219
00:15:19,304 --> 00:15:25,161
TALIESIN: When you get a moment, we could use you
for a second down here.

220
00:15:25,161 --> 00:15:26,541
SAM: All right.

221
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:27,832
TALIESIN: When you have a moment.

222
00:15:27,832 --> 00:15:31,311
LAURA: I start taking my broom and swinging it
around me to see if I hit anything that's

223
00:15:31,311 --> 00:15:32,477
invisible.

224
00:15:32,477 --> 00:15:33,526
MATT: Okay.

225
00:15:33,526 --> 00:15:44,283
LIAM: By the way, did you see anything when 
you crashed through? Were there people on the ship?

226
00:15:44,283 --> 00:15:50,566
MARISHA: No, there was one that I might have
crushed underneath me that went down. There were

227
00:15:50,566 --> 00:15:52,157
also others on the ship, correct?

228
00:15:52,157 --> 00:16:01,608
MATT: There were at least three on the ship. [no
audio] a head shot by Percy as it caught fire.

229
00:16:01,608 --> 00:16:06,383
There was another that was crushed beneath your
feet.

230
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:07,534
MARISHA: Yeah.

231
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:09,025
LIAM: So probably dead.

232
00:16:09,025 --> 00:16:14,707
MARISHA: You know, there might be a couple, if they're
real good swimmers, they might make it? With

233
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:23,344
severe burns. And psychological damage. But--
maybe?

234
00:16:23,344 --> 00:16:25,384
LIAM: A little creepy, but a very good job.

235
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:27,968
MARISHA: Thanks.

236
00:16:27,968 --> 00:16:33,159
SAM: I will turn Grog's head and point him back to
the campsite.

237
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,579
TRAVIS: How do you turn my head?

238
00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:42,307
SAM: Well, I'll say to you, oi, if you don't see
anything, caw once and we'll head back to camp.

239
00:16:42,307 --> 00:16:44,888
TRAVIS: (squawks three times)

240
00:16:44,888 --> 00:16:48,279
SAM: I forgot you can't count.

241
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:50,442
TALIESIN: He says he sees three things.

242
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:54,900
SAM: All right, we just fly around then.

243
00:16:54,900 --> 00:17:03,788
TRAVIS: Actually, instead of that, can we go 100
yards past the tree line and into more of the

244
00:17:03,788 --> 00:17:05,701
forest, just to see what's there?

245
00:17:05,701 --> 00:17:12,440
MATT: Okay, yeah. You coast up and begin pushing
through and down below, you can see occasional

246
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:17,577
breaks in the treeline here and there where you
can-- there's heavy brush underneath and the same

247
00:17:17,577 --> 00:17:24,780
horrible texture of broken glass jutting out in
haphazard patterns. There are certain areas where

248
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:31,703
the glass is aggressively broken, and some more
smooth glass. It looks like it depends on at what

249
00:17:31,703 --> 00:17:38,427
point this event happened that turned this entire
island and how much has been traversed in the

250
00:17:38,427 --> 00:17:40,516
time. But you can't make out much more than that
from your height.

251
00:17:40,516 --> 00:17:44,732
LIAM: Have I got about 30 or 40 minutes left for
the wings?

252
00:17:44,732 --> 00:17:45,900
MATT: Approximately.

253
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:50,122
LIAM: Yeah, I'm going to fly out over where the
ship was and see if anybody is doing the dog

254
00:17:50,122 --> 00:17:51,356
paddle out there.

255
00:17:51,356 --> 00:17:53,793
MATT: Okay. You go heading off in that direction.

256
00:17:53,793 --> 00:17:56,149
TRAVIS: I'll land us at the treeline.

257
00:17:56,149 --> 00:18:07,395
MATT: Okay. You guys land at the treeline. As you
land, Laura, Percy and Keyleth, you guys-- there's

258
00:18:07,395 --> 00:18:12,202
this breeze that's been blowing through the beach
since you've gotten here, it's starting to pulse a

259
00:18:12,202 --> 00:18:19,795
little. (wind sounds) And the wind's starting to
pick up, rather suddenly. Keyleth, you are

260
00:18:19,795 --> 00:18:25,288
relatively sensitive to this, knowing that the sky
has been relatively clear with bits of cloud.

261
00:18:25,288 --> 00:18:28,587
There's no particular reason as to why there
should be a sudden gust of wind. There is no

262
00:18:28,587 --> 00:18:30,621
weather that is indicative of that sort of--

263
00:18:30,621 --> 00:18:32,737
MARISHA: Also my Control Weather spell should
still be active.

264
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:33,949
MATT: Yes.

265
00:18:33,949 --> 00:18:38,953
MARISHA: So nature check? Druid check? What the
shit is happening check?

266
00:18:38,953 --> 00:18:40,702
TALIESIN: Nurture check.

267
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:46,958
MARISHA: Nurture check? Nature versus nurture
check? 14?

268
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:56,504
MATT: 14. This is definitely not a natural wind.
And as you start to get that dark feeling at the

269
00:18:56,504 --> 00:19:02,679
back of your head, you start noticing that some of
the broken glass that is across the entirety of

270
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:10,304
this beach being picked up by the wind. Swirling
and congealing into a small whirlwind of broken

271
00:19:10,304 --> 00:19:12,059
glass and dust.

272
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:14,386
MARISHA: I toss Percy his gun.

273
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:20,587
MATT: You watch as the wind begins to pick up into
two other separate, smaller shapes, but that one

274
00:19:20,587 --> 00:19:24,437
central funnel continues to grow and grow, like
this angry, waving tornado of broken--

275
00:19:24,437 --> 00:19:28,037
TALIESIN: I'm going to flip one of the boats over
as a shield and hide behind it.

276
00:19:28,037 --> 00:19:33,205
MARISHA: As a druid, would I recognize if this is
an air elemental situation?

277
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:35,612
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

278
00:19:35,612 --> 00:19:38,005
MARISHA: Ugh, why are they always intelligence--

279
00:19:38,005 --> 00:19:40,346
MATT: With advantage because it is possibly
elemental-based.

280
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,073
TALIESIN: Hey!

281
00:19:42,073 --> 00:19:43,731
MARISHA: Natural 20!

282
00:19:43,731 --> 00:19:51,242
MATT: Two of the entities that are coming out of
this wind from the sides are definitely air

283
00:19:51,242 --> 00:19:57,232
elemental by nature. You're very familiar with
this form of physicality. You've taken on this

284
00:19:57,232 --> 00:20:04,816
form of physicality. However, whatever this large,
strange glass-shard-encompassed entity is, it's

285
00:20:04,816 --> 00:20:08,963
elemental in nature but you're not sure what it
is. You've not encountered something of this form,

286
00:20:08,963 --> 00:20:11,054
at least on this plane.

287
00:20:11,054 --> 00:20:12,272
MARISHA: Bigger?

288
00:20:12,272 --> 00:20:13,062
MATT: Bigger.

289
00:20:13,062 --> 00:20:14,066
MARISHA: Badder?

290
00:20:14,066 --> 00:20:15,335
MATT: I would like you to roll initiative.

291
00:20:15,335 --> 00:20:16,527
TRAVIS: Just the three of them, right?

292
00:20:16,527 --> 00:20:21,276
LAURA: Does the wind seem strong enough that if I
hopped up on my broom that I would get blown

293
00:20:21,276 --> 00:20:22,225
away?

294
00:20:22,225 --> 00:20:23,804
MATT: Not at the moment, no.

295
00:20:23,804 --> 00:20:26,015
LAURA: Okay, I want to try doing that, then.

296
00:20:26,015 --> 00:20:27,266
TRAVIS: Oh, he's pulling it back.

297
00:20:27,266 --> 00:20:29,315
MARISHA: Aw snap!

298
00:20:29,315 --> 00:20:30,625
LAURA: Look at the water!

299
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:31,905
LIAM: Boats, there's little boats!

300
00:20:31,905 --> 00:20:33,153
LAURA: It looks like waves.

301
00:20:33,153 --> 00:20:35,149
LIAM: (singing) Hello, my name is Simon.

302
00:20:35,149 --> 00:20:37,843
ALL: (singing) And I like to do drawings.

303
00:20:37,843 --> 00:20:45,627
MATT: Percy has taken one of the boats and placed
it as a guard. Keyleth stands here. You guys are

304
00:20:45,627 --> 00:20:47,241
way off at the treeline.

305
00:20:47,241 --> 00:20:48,831
TRAVIS: Just pointing and laughing.

306
00:20:48,831 --> 00:21:01,726
MATT: Oh god! I killed Percy! There we go. And
Vax, you're off that side. What you're seeing is

307
00:21:01,726 --> 00:21:08,463
this swirling torrent of broken glass with these
two air elementals encroaching on the sides there.

308
00:21:08,463 --> 00:21:10,559
SAM: Percy, you're going to need a bigger boat.

309
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,455
(laughter)

310
00:21:12,455 --> 00:21:15,605
MATT: And with that, let's go ahead and roll some
initiative, folks.

311
00:21:15,605 --> 00:21:17,383
LAURA: Did I get in the air before initiative,
or--?

312
00:21:17,383 --> 00:21:20,842
MATT: We'll say as the wind's picking up, you can
begin to get up in the air, yes.

313
00:21:20,842 --> 00:21:21,886
LAURA: Okay.

314
00:21:21,886 --> 00:21:24,879
MATT: How far are you going up? Whole 30 feet?

315
00:21:24,879 --> 00:21:26,831
LAURA: Like 20 feet.

316
00:21:26,831 --> 00:21:28,652
MATT: 20 feet? All righty, let's do it.

317
00:21:28,652 --> 00:21:33,335
MARISHA: (sighs) This isn't great.

318
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:34,863
TALIESIN: I don't quite know what to do.

319
00:21:34,863 --> 00:21:38,984
MARISHA: I don't, either. I'm assuming there
hasn't been enough time to where we've taken a

320
00:21:38,984 --> 00:21:40,372
short rest, correct?

321
00:21:40,372 --> 00:21:41,354
MATT: Nope!

322
00:21:41,354 --> 00:21:43,719
MARISHA: Not good, you guys.

323
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,494
MATT: Okay, we'll say there you are, on your
broom.

324
00:21:46,494 --> 00:21:47,782
LAURA: Thank you.

325
00:21:47,782 --> 00:21:50,225
MATT: So initiative rolls here.

326
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:59,207
LAURA: Trinket's going to be so useful against a
tornado.

327
00:21:59,207 --> 00:22:01,604
SAM: Yeah, he can bite the wind.

328
00:22:01,604 --> 00:22:04,329
LAURA: Yeah. Of course, really anything.

329
00:22:04,329 --> 00:22:07,734
TALIESIN: I legitimately have no idea what's about
to happen, because--

330
00:22:07,734 --> 00:22:10,707
MATT: All righty, so 25 to 20?

331
00:22:10,707 --> 00:22:12,090
TALIESIN: 22.

332
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:17,686
SAM: Are we all? We're not all rolling, just--

333
00:22:17,686 --> 00:22:22,684
MATT: Everyone right now? Even though you're not
currently in the middle of the fray, this is going

334
00:22:22,684 --> 00:22:24,577
to gauge how soon you can get to them.

335
00:22:24,577 --> 00:22:27,606
SAM: Oh. 19.

336
00:22:27,606 --> 00:22:28,848
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

337
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,979
LAURA: You're an eagle!

338
00:22:30,979 --> 00:22:32,889
TRAVIS: Because I have advantage on initiative
rolls.

339
00:22:32,889 --> 00:22:35,572
MATT: You do. So plus-- what's your dex?

340
00:22:35,572 --> 00:22:38,472
TRAVIS: My dex is two.

341
00:22:38,472 --> 00:22:39,527
MATT: So 22.

342
00:22:39,527 --> 00:22:42,432
TALIESIN: That's the same as me!

343
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:44,617
MATT: All right, 20 to 15?

344
00:22:44,617 --> 00:22:46,820
LIAM: 17.

345
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:52,193
MATT: 17. You got 19? Scanlan. Vax. 15 to ten.

346
00:22:52,193 --> 00:22:56,202
LAURA: Ten. Yay.

347
00:22:56,202 --> 00:23:00,152
MARISHA: Five. (clears throat) Five.

348
00:23:00,152 --> 00:23:05,135
LAURA: Oh no. You're going to be the most useful
one too. It's okay, it's power play right at the end.

349
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:07,874
MARISHA: [no audio] from the last fight.

350
00:23:07,874 --> 00:23:10,251
[no audio]

351
00:23:10,251 --> 00:23:13,764
MARISHA: It takes both of my beast-shaping forms
to go elemental.

352
00:23:13,764 --> 00:23:15,557
TRAVIS and LAURA: (singing) It takes two, baby!

353
00:23:15,557 --> 00:23:17,660
MARISHA: (singing) It takes two, baby!

354
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,359
LIAM: Wow, I did that too, except I went Into the
Woods.

355
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:29,329
MATT: Swirling forward, the giant maelstrom, its
speed rapid-fast, this torrent of razor-sharp

356
00:23:29,329 --> 00:23:37,739
glass bits spirals forward and threatens to engulf
both Percy and Vex.

357
00:23:37,739 --> 00:23:39,163
LAURA: Guess I should have gone higher.

358
00:23:39,163 --> 00:23:40,880
TALIESIN: It's going to mock my cover, isn't it?

359
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:47,397
MATT: Yeah, it moves around it. Unfortunately, a
[no audio] like this can swirl through the small

360
00:23:47,397 --> 00:24:00,184
spaces. All right, so we have that. It's going to
go ahead and attempt a Whirlwind.

361
00:24:00,184 --> 00:24:01,104
MARISHA: Yeah.

362
00:24:01,104 --> 00:24:05,025
MATT: So I need both Vex and Percy to roll a
strength saving throw.

363
00:24:05,025 --> 00:24:11,316
TALIESIN: Okay, this is not a ranged attack on any
level, I can't counter because it's not a ranged

364
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:21,682
attack. Okay! This is just going to suck. Ah! Well,
that's nice.

365
00:24:21,682 --> 00:24:23,137
LAURA: What?

366
00:24:23,137 --> 00:24:24,776
TALIESIN: 20.

367
00:24:24,776 --> 00:24:26,822
LAURA: Oh. That's nicer. 15.

368
00:24:26,822 --> 00:24:39,079
MATT: Okay. So Percy. You go ahead and take ten
points of piercing damage as the glass shards go

369
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:43,365
splitting towards you, jamming into your exposed
skin. You get underneath the boat and it just

370
00:24:43,365 --> 00:24:48,908
gives you enough cover to minimize the damage.
You, however, up above. The wind picks up and

371
00:24:48,908 --> 00:24:53,570
swirls around you. You're losing control of the
broom. You take 20 points of piercing damage in

372
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:55,898
the center of this cyclone of death.

373
00:24:55,898 --> 00:24:58,110
LAURA: Cyclone of death!

374
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:10,338
MATT: All right, and you are flung 40 feet in a
random direction. That would be that way. So you

375
00:25:10,338 --> 00:25:20,159
are flung this far away, off the broom and prone,
and you fall and hit the ground. I need you to go

376
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,817
ahead and roll a dexterity saving throw. Actually
no, because you didn't hit anything else. You

377
00:25:23,817 --> 00:25:29,274
don't need to do that. So this is going to be
straight fall damage. It's an additional ten

378
00:25:29,274 --> 00:25:33,277
points of bludgeoning damage as you hit the
ground, the wind almost knocked out of your chest,

379
00:25:33,277 --> 00:25:35,171
still clutching the broom in your left hand.

380
00:25:35,171 --> 00:25:38,726
LAURA: Yeah, it's also got a thing on it that
hooks to me that Percy made.

381
00:25:38,726 --> 00:25:40,330
TALIESIN: Yeah, it can't fly too far.

382
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,645
MATT: Yeah, you're still holding onto it.

383
00:25:41,645 --> 00:25:42,837
LAURA: It's like a surfboard.

384
00:25:42,837 --> 00:25:43,975
LIAM: Boogie board.

385
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:49,479
MATT: All right, that ends its turn. That brings
us to Percy. Beginning of your turn, you are still

386
00:25:49,479 --> 00:25:57,281
in the whirlwind currently, and its jagged form
forces you to take 13 points of piercing damage,

387
00:25:57,281 --> 00:25:59,871
just being in the maelstrom itself.

388
00:25:59,871 --> 00:26:01,809
TALIESIN: 13 points? Okay.

389
00:26:01,809 --> 00:26:03,885
MATT: 13 points of piercing damage. Now it's your
turn, Percy.

390
00:26:03,885 --> 00:26:12,079
TALIESIN: That's 89. Okay, I'm sorry. I'm doing
math, which is apparently really difficult. It's

391
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:23,922
been a day. Okay, out of desperation, having no
possible idea of what else to do, I'm going to try

392
00:26:23,922 --> 00:26:29,776
and shoot at bits of it to see if I can dislodge
anything? I don't know, trying to shatter some of

393
00:26:29,776 --> 00:26:32,076
the glass? And yell bloody murder?

394
00:26:32,076 --> 00:26:33,346
MATT: Okay.

395
00:26:33,346 --> 00:26:35,965
TALIESIN: I'll take a standard shot to begin
with.

396
00:26:35,965 --> 00:26:37,534
MATT: Are you going to move, or are you going to
stay where you are?

397
00:26:37,534 --> 00:26:41,786
TALIESIN: For the moment, I'm going to stay where
I am. Well actually, I'm too close to get a decent

398
00:26:41,786 --> 00:26:42,866
shot, aren't I?

399
00:26:42,866 --> 00:26:45,461
MATT: It will give you disadvantage on each
attack, because you're doing ranged in melee.

400
00:26:45,461 --> 00:26:53,179
TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to back off about
ten feet?

401
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:55,963
MATT: Which direction? Into the water?

402
00:26:55,963 --> 00:27:02,347
TALIESIN: Yep! I want to be about waist-deep, if I
can.

403
00:27:02,347 --> 00:27:08,079
MATT: Okay, you're still technically in melee. It
has a large reach with its [no audio] if you move

404
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:09,391
five more feet, you can.

405
00:27:09,391 --> 00:27:10,358
TALIESIN: I'll move five more feet--

406
00:27:10,358 --> 00:27:11,737
MATT: You're now above [no audio]

407
00:27:11,737 --> 00:27:12,733
TALIESIN: Yep.

408
00:27:12,733 --> 00:27:18,229
MATT: Knees and waist, so your movement is halved.
However, as you pull out of its range, a giant

409
00:27:18,229 --> 00:27:24,255
pseudopod of swirling [no audio] (whoosh) runs
towards you and gets an attack of opportunity on you.

410
00:27:24,255 --> 00:27:26,917
TALIESIN: That's fine.

411
00:27:26,917 --> 00:27:29,162
MATT: It rolled really bad. That is a 14.

412
00:27:29,162 --> 00:27:30,759
TALIESIN: My AC is 18.

413
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:36,017
MATT: You weave underneath, the wind causes the
water around you to splash and scatter in both

414
00:27:36,017 --> 00:27:41,112
directions, but you avoid a giant blender of
broken glass to the face. What are you doing?

415
00:27:41,112 --> 00:27:44,533
TALIESIN: (sighs) It's reminding me of something
that happened this week. Okay, I'm going to take

416
00:27:44,533 --> 00:27:49,377
a-- blender of glass. It's a whole thing. I'm
going to take a shot at it to see if it does

417
00:27:49,377 --> 00:27:50,468
anything?

418
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:51,703
MARISHA: We need to have breakfast.

419
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:52,714
TALIESIN: I know.

420
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:53,957
MARISHA: What the fuck.

421
00:27:53,957 --> 00:27:55,181
TALIESIN: We never talk anymore.

422
00:27:55,181 --> 00:27:56,433
LIAM: In character or out of character?

423
00:27:56,433 --> 00:27:57,518
MARISHA: Both?

424
00:27:57,518 --> 00:27:59,167
MATT: Grog, you're up next.

425
00:27:59,167 --> 00:28:01,732
TALIESIN: That's 23 to hit?

426
00:28:01,732 --> 00:28:03,584
MATT: 23 to hit hits.

427
00:28:03,584 --> 00:28:05,841
TALIESIN: All right, let's see what happens
with--

428
00:28:05,841 --> 00:28:07,656
LAURA: When you shoot a whirlwind.

429
00:28:07,656 --> 00:28:10,466
TALIESIN: I'm trying to shoot a whirlwind. I don't
know if this is actually going to do anything. I'm

430
00:28:10,466 --> 00:28:14,523
not feeling very hopeful. Nine points of piercing
damage?

431
00:28:14,523 --> 00:28:20,746
MATT: Okay, gotcha. You fire and you watch as some
of its form takes impact and some of the glass

432
00:28:20,746 --> 00:28:28,304
breaks. It looks like it did sustain some sort of
esoteric wound from the blast, though not as much

433
00:28:28,304 --> 00:28:30,344
as you would hope from your weapon.

434
00:28:30,344 --> 00:28:31,396
TALIESIN: Huh.

435
00:28:31,396 --> 00:28:32,809
MATT: But it did take damage.

436
00:28:32,809 --> 00:28:35,551
TALIESIN: I assume none of my Trick Shot stuff is
going to use-- that thing's weird.

437
00:28:35,551 --> 00:28:39,348
MARISHA: It'll work. They take half damage for
shit.

438
00:28:39,348 --> 00:28:49,947
TALIESIN: Okay! I'm going to take a couple shots,
see what happens. I'm going to do a Sharpshooter shot.

439
00:28:49,947 --> 00:28:51,181
MATT: Okay.

440
00:28:51,181 --> 00:28:55,517
TALIESIN: That's another 23.

441
00:28:55,517 --> 00:28:58,223
MATT: With the Sharpshooter minus five? Hits.

442
00:28:58,223 --> 00:29:06,443
TALIESIN: Yeah, that was a much better roll. So
that's 24 points of damage.

443
00:29:06,443 --> 00:29:13,230
MATT: 24. All righty. This one still is a larger
impact than the last one, but it's still shooting

444
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:18,641
in the middle of this swirling mass, so it's not
impacting it as much as you'd hoped.

445
00:29:18,641 --> 00:29:31,919
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a third shot. And here
we go. With the same Sharpshooter. 21.

446
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,291
MATT: 21 hits.

447
00:29:33,291 --> 00:29:42,338
TALIESIN: Ooh, that's nice! 25 points of damage.
It was a very good shot. And I'm now going to call

448
00:29:42,338 --> 00:29:49,210
over the earpiece: everyone back! Giant flying
glass wind, oh god! And I'm going to take a deep

449
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:53,197
breath-- that's actually what I said. I'm going to
take a deep breath and I'm going to dive

450
00:29:53,197 --> 00:29:57,322
underwater. Put my gun away and dive underwater.

451
00:29:57,322 --> 00:30:02,960
MATT: All right. Underneath the surface there. It
is murky and dark. It's so close to the shoreline

452
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,952
and with the black silt that washes in there, you
have no visibility underneath.

453
00:30:06,952 --> 00:30:07,972
TALIESIN: That's cool.

454
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,485
MATT: All right. That brings us to Grog.

455
00:30:09,485 --> 00:30:15,215
TRAVIS: (squawks) I look over at Scanlan and I'm
like (squawk)?

456
00:30:15,215 --> 00:30:19,243
SAM: Kill the wind! Let's go!

457
00:30:19,243 --> 00:30:26,538
TRAVIS: So can I hold my movement until Scanlan
moves? So I'll take us both over there is my

458
00:30:26,538 --> 00:30:28,123
intention.

459
00:30:28,123 --> 00:30:29,846
MATT: You can't hold your movement,
unfortunately.

460
00:30:29,846 --> 00:30:31,100
TRAVIS: Can't hold my movement.

461
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,476
MATT: So you spend your movement and you can hold
your action to do something if you want to.

462
00:30:33,476 --> 00:30:36,885
LAURA: Yeah. Scanlan can probably turn you back
once you get over there.

463
00:30:36,885 --> 00:30:42,748
TRAVIS: I'm going to take off and I'm going to go
towards them and as high as I can go.

464
00:30:42,748 --> 00:30:45,928
MATT: Okay. Giant eagle's speed.

465
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:47,296
SAM: Bye, Grog.

466
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:49,259
LIAM: Bye!

467
00:30:49,259 --> 00:30:58,062
MATT: So yeah. You're a little over 100 feet away
from them, so the 80 feet as your movement speed,

468
00:30:58,062 --> 00:31:02,030
with just your movement and holding your action if
you wanted to, you can coast up as fast as you

469
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:06,919
can, and at that apex of the end of your movement,
what action are you holding? What's the trigger?

470
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:13,585
TRAVIS: I'll actually go ahead and take my action
and I'll stop flapping my wings. My intention is

471
00:31:13,585 --> 00:31:15,070
to plummet.

472
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:22,073
MATT: Okay. Well then, you can use your action to
then move again, like dash it and go right above

473
00:31:22,073 --> 00:31:23,508
it if you wanted to do that.

474
00:31:23,508 --> 00:31:26,552
TRAVIS: Yeah, right above it. That'll work.

475
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:27,732
MATT: All right.

476
00:31:27,732 --> 00:31:31,743
TRAVIS: Because don't you guys like, once you
break out of your animal form, you change back?

477
00:31:31,743 --> 00:31:38,027
MARISHA: Well, you take damage and then whatever
damage that you take that is carried over into

478
00:31:38,027 --> 00:31:39,193
your real form.

479
00:31:39,193 --> 00:31:40,612
LIAM: Into your 5,000 hit points.

480
00:31:40,612 --> 00:31:41,810
TALIESIN: You'll be fine.

481
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:45,630
MARISHA: So if you take 80 hit points, you'll take
you know, the ten that your eagle form took and

482
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,004
then you'll take the other 70.

483
00:31:47,004 --> 00:31:49,525
SAM: You'll be fine. I like this plan.

484
00:31:49,525 --> 00:31:51,245
MARISHA: You'll be fine. You're Grog. You got it.

485
00:31:51,245 --> 00:31:52,426
SAM: Suicidal eagle.

486
00:31:52,426 --> 00:31:55,530
LAURA: You're went 100 feet up, Travis? Grog?

487
00:31:55,584 --> 00:31:59,908
MATT: There's you with a Scanlan.

488
00:31:59,908 --> 00:32:01,942
SAM: Oh! Oh, I was on him.

489
00:32:01,942 --> 00:32:03,923
MATT: Unless you didn't want to be on him. You
want to stay behind?

490
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:05,452
SAM: Sure, I guess I'm taking this ride too.

491
00:32:05,452 --> 00:32:08,143
MATT: If you want, you can still be 100 feet
back.

492
00:32:08,143 --> 00:32:10,063
TRAVIS: You can fall off into the water if--

493
00:32:10,063 --> 00:32:11,231
SAM: No, I would have gone with him.

494
00:32:11,231 --> 00:32:12,554
MATT: Because I was thinking you were on his back
still.

495
00:32:12,554 --> 00:32:13,539
SAM: Sure.

496
00:32:13,539 --> 00:32:20,159
MATT: All right, there it is. So you're holding,
so that's your turn. What are you doing, Scanlan?

497
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:25,456
SAM: Well, I can't do much now because if I do
anything, he'll break his eagle form.

498
00:32:25,456 --> 00:32:26,714
TRAVIS: Which is okay!

499
00:32:26,714 --> 00:32:28,765
SAM: And then I'll fall too!

500
00:32:28,765 --> 00:32:30,286
LIAM: Hopefully you're close.

501
00:32:30,286 --> 00:32:36,929
SAM: So I'm 100 feet up. Straight up over this
thing. Right?

502
00:32:36,929 --> 00:32:39,262
MATT: 80 feet up.

503
00:32:39,262 --> 00:32:47,674
SAM: 80 feet up. Okay, I hang over the side and I
will Lightning Bolt straight down into the

504
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,562
eye of the tornado.

505
00:32:49,562 --> 00:32:53,649
MATT: All righty. So with that--

506
00:32:53,649 --> 00:32:56,917
LAURA: I feel like lightning is good because it
turns glass into--

507
00:32:56,917 --> 00:33:02,604
MATT: That is 19 for its dexterity save. What's
your DC with your cone?

508
00:33:02,604 --> 00:33:04,478
SAM: Oh, it's 21.

509
00:33:04,478 --> 00:33:07,788
MATT: 21. So yeah, it fails. Go ahead and roll
damage on the Lightning Bolt.

510
00:33:07,788 --> 00:33:09,511
TALIESIN: Would I get caught in that?

511
00:33:09,511 --> 00:33:12,069
MATT: It's right at the cusp of the water.

512
00:33:12,069 --> 00:33:15,410
TALIESIN: It's also water. I honestly am just
looking for an excuse to hit the glove. I'm happy

513
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,177
to take the damage.

514
00:33:17,177 --> 00:33:20,164
MATT: I would say that due to the proximity you
might take a little bit because the conduit of the

515
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:23,757
water around you. Because it's a lot of water,
it's going to dissipate pretty evenly.

516
00:33:23,757 --> 00:33:25,776
SAM: 28.

517
00:33:25,776 --> 00:33:34,012
MATT: 28. All right. It blasts through the storm,
slamming, causing glass dust to shoot up in this

518
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:41,663
giant cloud around it and fall gently to the beach
side. You go ahead and take, Percy, five points of

519
00:33:41,663 --> 00:33:43,705
lightning damage, just being nearby in the water.

520
00:33:43,705 --> 00:33:45,135
TALIESIN: Awesome possum.

521
00:33:45,135 --> 00:33:50,371
MATT: It impacted, though not as strongly as you
would have hoped. It seems almost like the

522
00:33:50,371 --> 00:33:55,669
lightning is somewhat in the sphere of the element
of whatever this creature is.

523
00:33:55,669 --> 00:33:57,928
SAM: Oh. So it did not take full--

524
00:33:57,928 --> 00:33:59,862
MATT: It took damage, but it didn't take full
damage.

525
00:33:59,862 --> 00:34:05,720
MARISHA: It's also the air druid you've been
travelling with. Uses a lot of lightning. (coughs)

526
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:12,602
MATT: (laughs) Does that end your turn, Scanlan?
Are you going to move or do anything?

527
00:34:12,602 --> 00:34:14,593
SAM: Yeah, I mean, I don't want to move.

528
00:34:14,593 --> 00:34:16,379
TALIESIN: He says he can't hear you over the
comm.

529
00:34:16,379 --> 00:34:17,483
SAM: I'll inspire Grog.

530
00:34:17,483 --> 00:34:19,237
MATT: He's the only one within earshot, so yes.

531
00:34:19,237 --> 00:34:30,335
SAM: I will sing in his ear: (singing) Fly like an
eagle to the sea. Fly like an eagle-- don't drop me!

532
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:34,032
(laughter)

533
00:34:34,032 --> 00:34:38,378
LIAM, MARISHA and TALIESIN: (sing to the tune of
"Fly Like An Eagle")

534
00:34:38,378 --> 00:34:42,109
MATT: All right, go ahead and take your d10
inspiration die. All righty, ending Scanlan's

535
00:34:42,109 --> 00:34:43,361
turn. Vax, you're up.

536
00:34:43,361 --> 00:34:44,546
LIAM: How far away did I get?

537
00:34:44,546 --> 00:34:49,683
MATT: You just took off when this happened or
heard that, so you'd be your full movement away

538
00:34:49,683 --> 00:34:51,641
from it, which is 60 feet?

539
00:34:51,641 --> 00:34:52,820
LIAM: 60 feet, yeah.

540
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:57,480
MATT: At this point, Haste has worn off. So you're
60 feet away. It would take you your full

541
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,450
movement. You can swoop back and get right in the
fray.

542
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:03,436
LIAM: Yes, then I would like to fly straight at
the maelstrom.

543
00:35:03,436 --> 00:35:05,720
LAURA: And stab the whirlwind.

544
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,324
LIAM: I would like to do that, actually.

545
00:35:07,324 --> 00:35:11,862
MATT: You're going to dive-bomb through and
chest-burster out the other side of this

546
00:35:11,862 --> 00:35:12,854
whirlwind.

547
00:35:12,854 --> 00:35:16,101
LIAM: I hope so! I hope so, and is that Trinket
right next to it?

548
00:35:16,101 --> 00:35:17,336
LAURA: It is.

549
00:35:17,336 --> 00:35:22,014
LIAM: Then I will get sneak attack damage and I
would like to use, oh good god, Divine Smite on

550
00:35:22,014 --> 00:35:23,270
the attack.

551
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:24,873
SAM: Ooh, what is that all about?

552
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:28,589
MATT: Okay. Hold Divine Smite until you hit. You
don't have to say you use it until you confirm hit.

553
00:35:28,589 --> 00:35:32,365
LIAM: Right. All right. That's a 20. That's a 30.

554
00:35:32,365 --> 00:35:34,428
MATT: That'll hit.

555
00:35:34,428 --> 00:35:35,623
LAURA: That was so close to a one.

556
00:35:35,623 --> 00:35:37,107
LIAM: Yeah. It went one, 19.

557
00:35:37,107 --> 00:35:38,438
MATT: Yeah, that'll hit.

558
00:35:38,438 --> 00:35:50,844
LIAM: All right. So we start with a one and then
we add these. Two, three, four, nine, 15, 20, 25,

559
00:35:50,844 --> 00:35:56,957
28. Plus Divine Smite, since this is the first
time I've ever done it, is 2d8. What did I just

560
00:35:56,957 --> 00:35:58,338
get up to? Shit.

561
00:35:58,338 --> 00:35:59,458
TRAVIS and LAURA: 28.

562
00:35:59,458 --> 00:36:04,320
LIAM: 28. Thank you. Plus Divine Smite is 20, 30,
38.

563
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:15,104
MATT: 38 points of damage. As your wings out,
bullet-bird form Vax, you swoop down and punch

564
00:36:15,104 --> 00:36:21,052
straight through the back of this maelstrom. You
see its form briefly fluctuate and have a hard

565
00:36:21,052 --> 00:36:26,802
time holding itself together as you slam into the
beach sand and glass right over next to Trinket,

566
00:36:26,802 --> 00:36:32,701
sending a cloud out in front of you that slowly
comes down like a wave on the opposite side. You

567
00:36:32,701 --> 00:36:37,466
stand there for a second, look back over and
Trinket licks you up on the side of your face,

568
00:36:37,466 --> 00:36:43,143
making a very cool moment maybe not as cool at the
very end, but still pretty cool overall. Cool, do

569
00:36:43,143 --> 00:36:44,630
you want to do anything else?

570
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:48,688
LIAM: So I used movement to get there?

571
00:36:48,688 --> 00:36:51,316
MATT: You used your movement to get there, you
used an attack to go through.

572
00:36:51,316 --> 00:36:52,988
LIAM: I'm going to swipe again, because I've got
the bonus action?

573
00:36:52,988 --> 00:36:55,852
MATT: Okay, this would be a throw, because right
now, the angle you had to come through to punch

574
00:36:55,852 --> 00:36:58,090
through it, you would have landed about 15 feet
from it.

575
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:03,544
LIAM: Love it. That is 24? Yeah.

576
00:37:03,544 --> 00:37:06,204
MATT: 24. So you land and then (whoosh) throw
another dagger back at that.

577
00:37:06,204 --> 00:37:13,990
LIAM: So excited by the Divine Smite. There's
that. And that is a little bitty two plus six is

578
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:17,732
eight. And I forgot to add my bonus to the dagger
before, so you can make that 14 for total damage.

579
00:37:17,732 --> 00:37:23,025
MATT: 14 total. Nice! So after you punch through,
you can see the burst through with this flash of

580
00:37:23,025 --> 00:37:28,898
vibrant radiant energy that sparks through its
internal form, a glow that's reminiscent of what

581
00:37:28,898 --> 00:37:34,092
you've seen from Pike's spells before, but with
more of a grayer, less yellow color to it.

582
00:37:34,092 --> 00:37:39,137
Throwing behind with that secondary dagger, it
plunges into the whirlwind and you see some sparks

583
00:37:39,137 --> 00:37:43,367
inside as it clashes with the different broken
pieces of glass and eventually returns to your

584
00:37:43,367 --> 00:37:45,397
hand. I believe that ends your turn.

585
00:37:45,397 --> 00:37:46,706
LIAM: I'm a real paladin!

586
00:37:46,706 --> 00:37:50,214
MATT: Now, the two other elementals are going to
go.

587
00:37:50,214 --> 00:37:51,865
LAURA: Oh no, there's two more?

588
00:37:51,865 --> 00:37:54,273
MATT: Yep. This one's going to flank up behind
Keyleth--

589
00:37:54,273 --> 00:37:56,159
MARISHA: What's up, brah?

590
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:57,807
LIAM: Glass as well, or--?

591
00:37:57,807 --> 00:37:59,407
MATT: No, these are actual air elementals.

592
00:37:59,407 --> 00:38:00,290
LIAM: Air elementals.

593
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:02,985
MATT: There is some glass being pulled up in their
form as they go, but it's not quite the maelstrom

594
00:38:02,985 --> 00:38:08,126
in the center that's drawing everything into it.
That's going to be two slam attacks against you,

595
00:38:08,126 --> 00:38:16,971
Keyleth, and two slam attacks against you, Vax.
Against Keyleth, that is 21?

596
00:38:16,971 --> 00:38:18,459
MARISHA: Yeah, that hits.

597
00:38:18,459 --> 00:38:21,576
MATT: And 19.

598
00:38:21,576 --> 00:38:24,385
MARISHA: That also hits.

599
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:25,918
LIAM: Disadvantage against me.

600
00:38:25,918 --> 00:38:30,617
MATT: Yes. That is 12?

601
00:38:30,617 --> 00:38:31,755
LIAM: Nope.

602
00:38:31,755 --> 00:38:34,634
MATT: And the other is 12. Rolled two fours in a
row.

603
00:38:34,634 --> 00:38:35,756
LIAM: Sorry, Charlie.

604
00:38:35,756 --> 00:38:40,909
MATT: The elemental comes up and swings its giant
whirlwind-like fists towards you. You duck under

605
00:38:40,909 --> 00:38:43,917
one and then leap over the second one, landing
back on your place in the beach. Keyleth,

606
00:38:43,917 --> 00:38:46,858
unfortunately, looking at the focus of this and
trying to ascertain the nature of what these

607
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:49,866
creatures are and how you could possibly control
or bend it--

608
00:38:49,866 --> 00:38:58,384
MARISHA: Oh hey, Gary, what's up? Aww man. God
damn it, Gary. You were always a dick.

609
00:38:58,384 --> 00:39:02,023
MATT: 14 points of bludgeoning damage.

610
00:39:02,023 --> 00:39:04,111
MARISHA: 14? Okay.

611
00:39:04,111 --> 00:39:07,976
MATT: And 13 points of bludgeoning damage. So 27
total.

612
00:39:07,976 --> 00:39:09,672
MARISHA: 27 total.

613
00:39:09,672 --> 00:39:11,906
LAURA: Is that a hit point ring?

614
00:39:11,906 --> 00:39:13,271
TALIESIN: Yeah.

615
00:39:13,271 --> 00:39:14,980
LAURA: That's badass.

616
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,978
MATT: All right, that ends their turn now. Vex,
you're up.

617
00:39:16,978 --> 00:39:17,923
LAURA: Me.

618
00:39:17,923 --> 00:39:21,957
MATT: You're ground into the sand right now, dug a
few inches into it from the impact of your

619
00:39:21,957 --> 00:39:24,153
shoulder and left a groove on the beach.

620
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:25,068
LAURA: Ow!

621
00:39:25,068 --> 00:39:26,924
MATT: There's glass sticking into your shoulder
and you're like "Ugh!"

622
00:39:26,924 --> 00:39:30,599
LAURA: Ugh! I stand up for my movement.

623
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:31,852
MATT: Half your movement.

624
00:39:31,852 --> 00:39:32,771
LAURA: Okay.

625
00:39:32,771 --> 00:39:34,273
MATT: So you still have 15 more feet you can
move.

626
00:39:34,273 --> 00:39:35,694
LAURA: Hunter's Mark that motherfucker!

627
00:39:35,694 --> 00:39:39,396
MATT: Big one?

628
00:39:39,396 --> 00:39:45,939
LAURA: Yeah, the big one! And then I'm going to
shoot him! Twice! With Fenthras, which is the

629
00:39:45,939 --> 00:39:48,299
first time I've actually shot a real arrow for
this one.

630
00:39:48,299 --> 00:39:49,535
MATT: Do it.

631
00:39:49,535 --> 00:39:50,959
LAURA: Okay, please hit.

632
00:39:50,959 --> 00:39:54,662
SAM: It breaks in half. Super old, it
doesn't work.

633
00:39:54,662 --> 00:39:56,224
LAURA: 27?

634
00:39:56,224 --> 00:39:57,584
MATT: 27 hits.

635
00:39:57,584 --> 00:39:58,619
LAURA: On the first hit.

636
00:39:58,619 --> 00:39:59,714
MATT: Yeah.

637
00:39:59,714 --> 00:40:04,045
LAURA: Natural one on the second, motherfuck. 16.
A natural one is--

638
00:40:04,045 --> 00:40:05,547
MATT: A natural one just misses, yeah.

639
00:40:05,547 --> 00:40:15,600
LAURA: Okay cool. That's awesome. Great. So wait.
That's a d8, plus a d4 for lightning. That's a

640
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:21,260
ten. Jesus. Wait. Ten plus ten is 20.

641
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:23,552
LIAM: So much math with this thing.

642
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:25,378
LAURA: I know. 23!

643
00:40:25,378 --> 00:40:28,114
MATT: 23 points of damage with one arrow. That's
really nice.

644
00:40:28,114 --> 00:40:29,373
TRAVIS: Yeah. That's a Vestige for you.

645
00:40:29,373 --> 00:40:32,327
MATT: Also, don't forget that--

646
00:40:32,327 --> 00:40:35,070
LAURA: Four of them is lightning.

647
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:41,462
MATT: Right. Four is lightning. So actually, that
would be halved. So that would be 21 points of

648
00:40:41,462 --> 00:40:57,325
damage. Also. When you take the attack action-- no,
you already used your bonus action to do the

649
00:40:57,325 --> 00:40:59,225
Hunter's Mark. Never mind.

650
00:40:59,225 --> 00:41:00,226
LAURA: What?

651
00:41:00,226 --> 00:41:02,791
MATT: I was going to say having Trinket next to
it, but I realized you used your bonus action to--

652
00:41:02,791 --> 00:41:06,001
LAURA: Yeah. I'm establishing that and then
Trinket can do his moves.

653
00:41:06,001 --> 00:41:07,010
MATT: Right. Okay, cool.

654
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:09,514
LAURA: Can I use the rest of my movement to get
back up on the broom? And go up in the air?

655
00:41:09,514 --> 00:41:12,543
MATT: Sure! You go ahead and grab the broom and
you manage to go ahead and--

656
00:41:12,543 --> 00:41:14,500
LAURA: Get 30 feet in the air this time maybe?

657
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:20,312
MATT: I'll say due to the nature of this, no, not
quite. You get 20.

658
00:41:20,312 --> 00:41:21,732
LAURA: Okay.

659
00:41:21,732 --> 00:41:32,529
MATT: Let's see. This is the extent of your
ascension right now. There you go. That ends your

660
00:41:32,529 --> 00:41:34,304
turn. Keyleth.

661
00:41:34,304 --> 00:41:40,755
MARISHA: Okay. So not feeling great about this
one.

662
00:41:40,755 --> 00:41:43,719
TRAVIS: This is, like, your shit, so let's go.

663
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:45,743
SAM: Put up or shut up, Keyleth.

664
00:41:45,743 --> 00:41:52,373
MARISHA: I could try and talk to them, but that
never goes well, let's be real. So I'm going to

665
00:41:52,373 --> 00:42:00,072
cast Wind Wall. Okay, here's my question. I'm
having a hard time seeing, so help me. That's me.

666
00:42:00,072 --> 00:42:02,889
Who's that?

667
00:42:02,889 --> 00:42:08,871
MATT: Vax is here with Trinket. Elemental,
elemental and the giant glass maelstrom.

668
00:42:08,871 --> 00:42:14,103
MARISHA: Okay. I have a 50-foot Wind Wall that I
can shape whichever way I want?

669
00:42:14,103 --> 00:42:15,128
MATT: Yep.

670
00:42:15,128 --> 00:42:23,760
MARISHA: So what I want to do is try and loop us
all in and go around, Jesus, go around this way.

671
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,481
LIAM: Oh yeah, go around Jesus.

672
00:42:25,481 --> 00:42:27,499
MATT: Like a circle, almost?

673
00:42:27,499 --> 00:42:32,543
MARISHA: Yes. Like a semi-circle starting with
this guy going this way. 50 feet.

674
00:42:32,543 --> 00:42:34,361
MATT: So like a Wind Wall--

675
00:42:34,361 --> 00:42:40,581
MARISHA: Because it can go over top of guys. So
starting 50 feet going around this way.

676
00:42:40,581 --> 00:42:43,938
MATT: Around a circle this way?

677
00:42:43,938 --> 00:42:49,023
MARISHA: The other way, but yeah. I mean it's 50
feet, it'll work. I guess it doesn't ultimately

678
00:42:49,023 --> 00:42:50,123
matter.

679
00:42:50,123 --> 00:42:51,808
MATT: What shape do you want with the Wind Wall?

680
00:42:51,808 --> 00:42:52,948
MARISHA: A circle.

681
00:42:52,948 --> 00:42:54,307
MATT: A circle like this?

682
00:42:54,307 --> 00:42:57,244
MARISHA: I want to block the three guys out with
my 50 feet.

683
00:42:57,244 --> 00:42:59,477
MATT: Out. I see.

684
00:42:59,477 --> 00:43:00,943
MARISHA: I want to go over top of them.

685
00:43:00,943 --> 00:43:01,778
MATT: Right.

686
00:43:01,778 --> 00:43:05,357
MARISHA: And keep us nice and safe and comfy in a
wind basket.

687
00:43:05,357 --> 00:43:06,744
MATT: Okay, so over top of them.

688
00:43:06,744 --> 00:43:10,278
Completely around you guys?

689
00:43:10,278 --> 00:43:13,139
MARISHA: Whatever 50 feet will cover.

690
00:43:13,139 --> 00:43:16,999
MATT: That's about the length right there.

691
00:43:16,999 --> 00:43:23,565
MARISHA: Because there's a little overlap, so can
I start it with this guy and then go around to

692
00:43:23,565 --> 00:43:25,888
where that couple feet goes to this guy?

693
00:43:25,888 --> 00:43:27,406
MATT: I mean it'll hit all three of them.

694
00:43:27,406 --> 00:43:29,004
MARISHA: Oh, okay! That's all I care about.

695
00:43:29,004 --> 00:43:37,940
MATT: Yeah. So you reach down, concentrate, slam
your hand onto the ground and as you do, the wind

696
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:45,438
picks up out of the dust and the dirt and the
glass and begins to cause another torrent of chaos

697
00:43:45,438 --> 00:43:49,648
around you, this one controlled by you, slamming
into the other ones. They have to make a strength

698
00:43:49,648 --> 00:43:50,718
saving throw.

699
00:43:50,718 --> 00:43:53,139
MARISHA: I say: That's a big tornado. I can make a
bigger one!

700
00:43:53,139 --> 00:43:55,239
MATT: What's your spell DC again?

701
00:43:55,239 --> 00:43:56,170
MARISHA: 19.

702
00:43:56,170 --> 00:44:06,686
MATT: 19. So this is a strength saving throw. 18.
Fail for the maelstrom. And fail, and fail. Fail

703
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:10,889
for all them! So that's 3d8 bludgeoning damage.

704
00:44:10,889 --> 00:44:16,634
MARISHA: Uh-huh, and they should be gaseous forms,
if I'm not mistaken, which means they can't move

705
00:44:16,634 --> 00:44:18,066
through it.

706
00:44:18,066 --> 00:44:21,720
MATT: Correct. So right now they are all currently
locked in the Wind Wall right now.

707
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:28,526
MARISHA: That's right they are! I'm done. I'm
excited. That's my thing. That's all I do.

708
00:44:28,526 --> 00:44:30,600
LAURA: Oh, roll damage!

709
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,015
MARISHA: Oh, sorry. Nature!

710
00:44:33,015 --> 00:44:35,136
SAM: It's like you were built for this fight.

711
00:44:35,136 --> 00:44:39,148
LAURA: Is it possible to go higher to get above
the Wind Wall?

712
00:44:39,148 --> 00:44:41,108
MATT: It's 15 feet.

713
00:44:41,108 --> 00:44:43,314
MARISHA: 13 damage! Not great.

714
00:44:43,314 --> 00:44:46,042
MATT: 15 feet high. So how much is it total?

715
00:44:46,042 --> 00:44:47,176
MARISHA: 13 total.

716
00:44:47,176 --> 00:44:48,874
TALIESIN: It's like you've weaponized a CVS
auto-door basically.

717
00:44:48,874 --> 00:44:55,554
MATT: All right, cool. Finishes your turn,
Keyleth. You staying where you are?

718
00:44:55,554 --> 00:44:59,171
MARISHA: Can I now shift away from the guy?

719
00:44:59,171 --> 00:45:02,852
MATT: It'll still get an attack of opportunity as
soon as you break from combat, but you can still

720
00:45:02,852 --> 00:45:03,793
move away.

721
00:45:03,793 --> 00:45:04,956
TALIESIN: Is it technically grappled?

722
00:45:04,956 --> 00:45:05,998
MATT: No, not grappled.

723
00:45:05,998 --> 00:45:08,302
MARISHA: He can't move through.

724
00:45:08,302 --> 00:45:17,108
MATT: They're fighting to keep themselves in place
and together as the Wind Wall is tearing them

725
00:45:17,108 --> 00:45:18,188
apart.

726
00:45:18,188 --> 00:45:23,071
MARISHA: I'll turn to them and be like: Let's do
the mirror game, man! Do the mirror game, yeah?

727
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:24,613
And that's it.

728
00:45:24,613 --> 00:45:38,653
MATT: The maelstrom cannot pass through the wall.
It is going to move away from it, shifting over to

729
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:45,906
where Percy is currently underwater. As you're
hiding down, this whirlpool begins to tear into it

730
00:45:45,906 --> 00:45:50,484
and all the water around you is jettisoned from
all sides. You're no longer submerged as you're

731
00:45:50,484 --> 00:45:51,891
lifted up.

732
00:45:51,891 --> 00:45:57,042
TALIESIN: Would that actually--? Okay, fine. In
theory, if there's a storm, you go underwater.

733
00:45:57,042 --> 00:45:58,706
MARISHA: You've seen Sharknado.

734
00:45:58,706 --> 00:46:07,515
MATT: This is an extremely forceful, angry magical
elemental tornado of death and hatred, so yes.

735
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:09,986
LIAM: Are you sure dragons are real?

736
00:46:09,986 --> 00:46:12,817
TALIESIN: I am absolutely sure dragons are real;
I've killed two of them.

737
00:46:12,817 --> 00:46:14,966
MARISHA: Percy, we've got cows!

738
00:46:14,966 --> 00:46:22,586
MATT: It does get its Whirlwind recharged, but
it's not going to use it. It's going to slam

739
00:46:22,586 --> 00:46:24,109
attack you twice, Percy.

740
00:46:24,109 --> 00:46:25,393
TALIESIN: That's fine.

741
00:46:25,393 --> 00:46:26,979
LAURA: It's saving its Whirlwind attack.

742
00:46:26,979 --> 00:46:36,535
MATT: It has advantage on attack rolls against you
because you are currently prone in the sand.

743
00:46:36,535 --> 00:46:39,784
That's going to be 22.

744
00:46:39,784 --> 00:46:41,005
TALIESIN: Oh, that hits.

745
00:46:41,005 --> 00:46:45,290
MATT: The second slam attack is going to be 31.

746
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:47,935
TALIESIN: Oh wow. Yeah, that somehow just barely
hits.

747
00:46:47,935 --> 00:46:58,191
MATT: The first attack is going to be 28 points of
piercing damage. Right on top, slamming you. Your

748
00:46:58,191 --> 00:47:05,917
face goes right into the muck with a sucking sound
as you feel like someone's grinding a hundred

749
00:47:05,917 --> 00:47:14,829
blades into the back of your skull. Then it
releases and comes down a second time for 22

750
00:47:14,829 --> 00:47:16,160
points of piercing damage.

751
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,209
LAURA: How many hit points do you start with,
Percy?

752
00:47:18,209 --> 00:47:19,856
TALIESIN: 112.

753
00:47:19,856 --> 00:47:23,929
LIAM: (scoffs) So offensive. I'm still at 99!

754
00:47:23,929 --> 00:47:27,326
TALIESIN: I am not doing well, but I am alive.

755
00:47:27,326 --> 00:47:29,361
MARISHA: You'll reach triple digits some day.

756
00:47:29,361 --> 00:47:31,599
LIAM: Yeah, I'll roll a one on my next level up.

757
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,109
(laughter)

758
00:47:34,109 --> 00:47:36,018
MATT: But you'll be there!

759
00:47:36,018 --> 00:47:39,596
LIAM: Oh, let me see what my constitution bonus
is. Oh, it's nothing.

760
00:47:39,596 --> 00:47:44,827
MATT: It is now your turn, Percival. At the
beginning of the turn, as you're in its jagged

761
00:47:44,827 --> 00:47:50,413
form radius, you take-- double ones. Seven points
of piercing damage.

762
00:47:50,413 --> 00:47:53,529
TRAVIS: Because he's in its what?

763
00:47:53,529 --> 00:47:57,108
MATT: He starts his turn within the center of its
form.

764
00:47:57,108 --> 00:47:58,286
TRAVIS: Got it. So stay out of that.

765
00:47:58,286 --> 00:48:02,137
MATT: Yeah, even being in its form is terrible.
It's like one of those money grab booths, except

766
00:48:02,137 --> 00:48:05,253
instead of money, it's just lots and lots of
pain.

767
00:48:05,253 --> 00:48:13,208
TALIESIN: Pain and lack of hit points. I also
assume it gets an attack of opportunity on me if I

768
00:48:13,208 --> 00:48:15,917
leave its radius.

769
00:48:15,917 --> 00:48:17,180
MATT: It does.

770
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:21,232
TALIESIN: Of course it does. It can break away
from the wall, it just can't pass through it.

771
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:22,485
MATT: Can't pass through it, correct.

772
00:48:22,485 --> 00:48:23,671
TALIESIN: Okay.

773
00:48:23,671 --> 00:48:27,672
MARISHA: Sorry, you left our huddle.

774
00:48:27,672 --> 00:48:35,824
TALIESIN: The first thing I'm going to do is burn
a bonus heal. I've got a heal that I can do, so

775
00:48:35,824 --> 00:48:44,646
I'm going to heal myself a little bit so I'm not
quite as close to death. Let's add 12 points.

776
00:48:44,646 --> 00:48:56,599
That's nice. Slightly better than before. Oh,
bugger. I'm going to pull my sword and,

777
00:48:56,599 --> 00:49:00,725
technically speaking, I'm perfectly fine to just
hack and slash on this thing right now, right?

778
00:49:00,725 --> 00:49:02,424
MATT: Yep! You stand up, using half your
movement.

779
00:49:02,424 --> 00:49:03,646
TRAVIS: Works for me.

780
00:49:03,646 --> 00:49:07,665
TALIESIN: I stand up using half my movement and
start slashing at it like nobody's business.

781
00:49:07,665 --> 00:49:09,183
MATT: Go for it, and it is a magical sword.

782
00:49:09,183 --> 00:49:13,545
TALIESIN: It is a magical sword. Thank you for
reminding me. I'm going to roll three at a time to make

783
00:49:13,545 --> 00:49:22,039
life a little easier. That's 21, 22, and 23.

784
00:49:22,039 --> 00:49:24,196
MATT: All hit! Go ahead and roll damage.

785
00:49:24,196 --> 00:49:25,567
SAM: Wow!

786
00:49:25,567 --> 00:49:28,313
MARISHA: You hit so easily.

787
00:49:28,313 --> 00:49:35,370
TALIESIN: I do. You know why I hit easily? Because
I do very little actual damage. It doesn't count

788
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:37,442
as a dragon, does it? Oh, look at that!

789
00:49:37,442 --> 00:49:38,856
SAM: They're all the same.

790
00:49:38,856 --> 00:49:39,738
TALIESIN: Yep!

791
00:49:39,738 --> 00:49:42,107
MARISHA: He rolled six, six six.

792
00:49:42,107 --> 00:49:51,651
TALIESIN: 13. I rolled six, six, six. Roll of the
beast. That's 39 points of damage.

793
00:49:51,651 --> 00:49:54,802
MATT: Okay. How do you want to do this?

794
00:49:54,802 --> 00:49:57,547
(cheering)

795
00:49:57,547 --> 00:49:58,893
SAM: You killed the wind!

796
00:49:58,893 --> 00:50:00,007
MATT: From the inside.

797
00:50:00,007 --> 00:50:01,621
MARISHA: From the inside!

798
00:50:01,621 --> 00:50:04,957
TALIESIN: Has anyone seen this terrible movie
called "Rob Roy?"

799
00:50:04,957 --> 00:50:06,134
TRAVIS: Oh yes.

800
00:50:06,134 --> 00:50:13,304
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to start conducting it
and spinning, slashing, and then dropping it to

801
00:50:13,304 --> 00:50:14,850
the bloody ground.

802
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:20,798
MATT: Okay, you guys watch as suddenly the
maelstrom begins to come to this uneasy torrent

803
00:50:20,798 --> 00:50:25,801
holding its form together. You start seeing
slashes and whirls of metal and flinging of

804
00:50:25,801 --> 00:50:31,332
blade-like action within the inside of its form
before, all of a sudden, there's a burst of glass

805
00:50:31,332 --> 00:50:36,279
and dust that then rains to the ground as the
water rushes into the space. You see there

806
00:50:36,279 --> 00:50:42,332
standing damp, cut, all these small wounds across
his face, lines of blood dripping down the sides,

807
00:50:42,332 --> 00:50:48,425
Percy, with the blade jammed into the beach, one
hand in the air as the water (splashing) up to his

808
00:50:48,425 --> 00:50:50,420
shoulders as he slowly stands up in place.

809
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:51,461
LAURA: Sick!

810
00:50:51,461 --> 00:50:55,294
TALIESIN: I'm going to slowly start making my way,
with great determination and not particularly much

811
00:50:55,294 --> 00:50:58,615
speed, I'm going to hobble my way toward the next
one of those bastards.

812
00:50:58,615 --> 00:51:07,125
MATT: Okay, so that's as far as you could get.
Because on land it's considered rough terrain. Or,

813
00:51:07,125 --> 00:51:12,262
you can go full speed but you'll take damage for
every five feet you move full speed. Glass, it

814
00:51:12,262 --> 00:51:15,387
sucks. All right, that ends Percy's turn, Grog
you're up.

815
00:51:15,387 --> 00:51:22,756
TRAVIS: All right, since he killed the big one can
I fly down to the one that's right next to Vax

816
00:51:22,756 --> 00:51:26,649
with Scanlan on my booty?

817
00:51:26,649 --> 00:51:28,809
MATT: Yes you can. (caws) Right next to him.

818
00:51:28,809 --> 00:51:34,039
TRAVIS: Yeah. Now, if hopefully I wanted him to
lift the form, would I hold my action?

819
00:51:34,039 --> 00:51:35,482
MATT: Yes.

820
00:51:35,482 --> 00:51:37,149
TRAVIS: Yes! I want to do that.

821
00:51:37,149 --> 00:51:40,261
MATT: So holding your attacks until the form is
lifted.

822
00:51:40,261 --> 00:51:43,648
TRAVIS: I want to land right next to him,
like right behind him.

823
00:51:43,648 --> 00:51:46,409
LIAM: You're a bird.

824
00:51:46,409 --> 00:51:49,942
MATT: Totally. That ends your turn, except for
your held action. What are you doing, Scanlan?

825
00:51:49,942 --> 00:51:52,468
SAM: Me? I have to do something now?

826
00:51:52,468 --> 00:51:53,509
MATT: Yeah. It's your turn.

827
00:51:53,509 --> 00:52:03,934
SAM: I will do Bigby's Hand, and it's a
concentration spell so Polymorph would drop for Grog.

828
00:52:03,934 --> 00:52:07,496
MATT: Yes, it does. Where is Bigby's Hand going?

829
00:52:07,496 --> 00:52:10,275
SAM: Right on the guy who's right in front of us.

830
00:52:10,275 --> 00:52:16,710
MATT: Before you continue that, as soon as Bigby's
Hand appears, the eagle form vanishes and Grog, you

831
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:19,770
come out with your axes in your hands, angry.

832
00:52:19,849 --> 00:52:21,063
TRAVIS: Surprise, bitches!

833
00:52:21,063 --> 00:52:22,790
MATT: Not raging unfortunately, but you do get
your attacks.

834
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:24,019
TRAVIS: Surprise, gents.

835
00:52:24,019 --> 00:52:28,845
MATT: You're angry, you're just not raging. So go
ahead, and take your two attacks.

836
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:31,841
TRAVIS: Woohoo! I would like to make them reckless
attacks.

837
00:52:31,841 --> 00:52:34,968
MATT: That's fine, but these are regular not rage
attacks.

838
00:52:34,968 --> 00:52:37,600
LIAM: I say, I'm going to have to kill you, dear
boy.

839
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:38,854
TRAVIS: That's a 15.

840
00:52:38,854 --> 00:52:45,592
MATT: 15, the first one? Total? That hits
actually. That just barely hits.

841
00:52:45,592 --> 00:52:48,759
TRAVIS: Should I roll the other one right now? Oh
no, it's just one attack, right?

842
00:52:48,759 --> 00:52:49,700
MATT: No, two attacks.

843
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:54,521
TRAVIS: Natural one. 24.

844
00:52:54,521 --> 00:52:56,234
MATT: Hits. So two hits on that.

845
00:52:56,234 --> 00:52:57,860
SAM: Yes, Grog, yes.

846
00:52:57,860 --> 00:53:01,690
LAURA: Make the wind your bitch.

847
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:14,622
TRAVIS: Yeah, make it my bitch. Ugh, math is hard.
16, plus bloodaxe, six, so 22.

848
00:53:14,622 --> 00:53:16,434
MATT: 22 for the first hit.

849
00:53:16,434 --> 00:53:27,516
TRAVIS: I'm working it out. The second one, 14,
then another six for 20. Necrotic on the last, yeah.

850
00:53:27,516 --> 00:53:30,984
MATT: Correct. All right, awesome. This is-- you're
not adding your rage damage to this.

851
00:53:30,984 --> 00:53:31,762
TRAVIS: No.

852
00:53:31,762 --> 00:53:35,682
MATT: Cool. So that finishes your two strikes.
Whack. Whack. Scanlan, you have your Bigby's Hand

853
00:53:35,682 --> 00:53:37,483
up. What are you going to do?

854
00:53:37,483 --> 00:53:39,386
SAM: Does it look like hitting it hurt it?

855
00:53:39,386 --> 00:53:40,191
MATT: Yeah.

856
00:53:40,191 --> 00:53:43,294
SAM: Okay, well then I'll punch it. I'll punch it
in its wind face.

857
00:53:43,294 --> 00:53:48,136
MATT: Right in its wind fucking face. All right,
go ahead and roll an attack using your melee spell

858
00:53:48,136 --> 00:53:50,161
attack. Roll a d20 and add your spell attack bonus.

859
00:53:50,161 --> 00:53:54,389
SAM: Is that a futzed roll? I need a judgment.

860
00:53:54,389 --> 00:53:56,032
TALIESIN: I'm calling it futzed.

861
00:53:56,032 --> 00:53:57,088
SAM: Okay.

862
00:53:57,088 --> 00:53:59,001
TRAVIS: Did I have a bonus action or did I use it
to hit?

863
00:53:59,001 --> 00:54:00,849
MATT: You can't hold a bonus action. That was on
your turn.

864
00:54:00,849 --> 00:54:03,216
SAM: Nine plus 11. 20.

865
00:54:03,216 --> 00:54:14,641
MATT: 20 just-- no, 20 hits, totally. So yeah,
roll 4d8 force damage.

866
00:54:14,641 --> 00:54:15,943
LAURA: Wow.

867
00:54:15,943 --> 00:54:17,490
TALIESIN: You need some d8s or you cool?

868
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:24,113
SAM: Nah, I'll just do this. 18.

869
00:54:24,113 --> 00:54:25,649
MARISHA: Kill it. Kill it.

870
00:54:25,649 --> 00:54:30,911
MATT: So between Grog's attacks and the giant fist
slamming into the side of the air elemental, you

871
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:36,016
can see it gets slammed to the dust, causing this
push and it begins to lift itself up, causing this

872
00:54:36,016 --> 00:54:44,144
almost jack-o-lantern angry face to appear in this
whirlwind. But it's a having a hard time keeping

873
00:54:44,144 --> 00:54:51,920
its form together. It begins to glance about for
some form of escape. Scanlan, do you want to move

874
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,179
on your turn at all?

875
00:54:53,179 --> 00:54:59,338
SAM: I will inspire Vax with a selection from The
Ultimate Dad Jokes.

876
00:54:59,338 --> 00:55:01,147
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

877
00:55:01,147 --> 00:55:02,963
LIAM: I am so ready for this.

878
00:55:02,963 --> 00:55:04,332
SAM: Should I pick a random page?

879
00:55:04,332 --> 00:55:05,654
LIAM: Hit me.

880
00:55:05,654 --> 00:55:12,914
SAM: A conductor once told me that a euphonium is
Latin for you're a fraud.

881
00:55:12,914 --> 00:55:15,329
LAURA: What? Oh, you phony.

882
00:55:15,329 --> 00:55:24,961
SAM: What's the name of the movie about the Cow
von Trapp family? The Sound of Moo-sic.

883
00:55:24,961 --> 00:55:27,994
MATT: All right, take your inspiration die.

884
00:55:27,994 --> 00:55:33,427
LIAM: Subtracted from me instead? He never gives
me inspiration that often. What is it?

885
00:55:33,427 --> 00:55:34,769
MATT: 1d10.

886
00:55:34,769 --> 00:55:37,410
SAM: Oh, fellow dad for that joke.

887
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:40,003
MATT: Did your inspiration die go up last level,
or is it next one?

888
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:42,355
SAM: Well, it's been d10 for a while.

889
00:55:42,355 --> 00:55:46,223
MATT: Right, but I'm trying to remember. I think
it's next level it goes up to a d12.

890
00:55:46,223 --> 00:55:47,514
LAURA: Oh, you haven't leveled up.

891
00:55:47,514 --> 00:55:49,450
TALIESIN: We haven't leveled up yet. We're still
hanging at 14.

892
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:52,643
SAM: Yeah, it's d10.

893
00:55:52,643 --> 00:55:54,551
MATT: Yeah. Next level it becomes a d12.

894
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:56,281
MARISHA: We're level elitists for two more games.

895
00:55:56,281 --> 00:55:59,755
MATT: Basically. Scanlan's turn's over. Vax,
you're up.

896
00:55:59,755 --> 00:56:03,984
LIAM: I have a rules question, DM. Normally when I
attack one character, one attack gets sneak

897
00:56:03,984 --> 00:56:08,554
attack, but can I sneak attack the one behind me
and attack the other one that's by Keyleth? I've

898
00:56:08,554 --> 00:56:09,930
got friends around both.

899
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:12,427
MATT: You can attack them both, but you only can
sneak attack once per round.

900
00:56:12,427 --> 00:56:18,324
LIAM: On one, okay. Then I'm going to shank
backwards to the one behind me, and it's flanked.

901
00:56:18,324 --> 00:56:20,793
There's four of us around it, so advantage on this
one.

902
00:56:20,793 --> 00:56:23,012
MATT: Well, let's go ahead and and look at that
Wind Wall.

903
00:56:23,012 --> 00:56:25,701
LIAM: Okay.

904
00:56:25,701 --> 00:56:27,697
TALIESIN: Let's take a look at the Wind Wall.

905
00:56:27,697 --> 00:56:33,191
MARISHA: It should only affect ranged attacks. It
should only affect ranged attacks and gaseous

906
00:56:33,191 --> 00:56:36,215
creatures because I doubled checked that.

907
00:56:36,215 --> 00:56:38,598
TRAVIS: Honestly, I'm quite often a gaseous
creature.

908
00:56:38,598 --> 00:56:42,010
TALIESIN: You are definitely. You are practically
my textbook definition of a gaseous creature.

909
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:50,147
MATT: It won't have much of an impact on you.
You're fine. Just making sure. Forcing your hand

910
00:56:50,147 --> 00:56:51,169
through it.

911
00:56:51,169 --> 00:56:52,029
LIAM: 23.

912
00:56:52,029 --> 00:56:55,149
MATT: 23 hits. Are you sneak attacking this one or
the other one?

913
00:56:55,149 --> 00:56:57,246
LIAM: This one.

914
00:56:57,246 --> 00:56:58,394
MATT: Okay.

915
00:56:58,394 --> 00:57:02,658
LIAM: Three, plus (yelps) four equals seven.

916
00:57:02,658 --> 00:57:04,342
LAURA: (laughs and imitates yelp)

917
00:57:04,342 --> 00:57:05,999
TALIESIN: Muppet Liam.

918
00:57:05,999 --> 00:57:07,555
TRAVIS: That sound!

919
00:57:07,555 --> 00:57:09,164
LIAM: 28 on that one.

920
00:57:09,164 --> 00:57:12,873
LIAM: (yells) That's Howard Dean.

921
00:57:12,873 --> 00:57:17,188
MATT: As you stab through, the form dissipates
upon impact.

922
00:57:17,188 --> 00:57:22,005
LIAM: I was hoping that would happen, and then I'm
going to dive and roll around Keyleth and stab the

923
00:57:22,005 --> 00:57:23,441
next one.

924
00:57:23,441 --> 00:57:30,872
MATT: As you throw your dagger, it does catch the
Wind Wall and gets flung out of the way.

925
00:57:30,872 --> 00:57:33,079
LIAM: No, I meant to run that way.

926
00:57:33,079 --> 00:57:34,618
MATT: Oh, you want to run this way.

927
00:57:34,618 --> 00:57:35,700
LIAM: Can I run through it?

928
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:37,994
MATT: Okay. You can move up to there. That you
can.

929
00:57:37,994 --> 00:57:40,452
LIAM: And attack, and that was a 23 to hit.

930
00:57:40,452 --> 00:57:41,506
MATT: 23 does hit.

931
00:57:41,506 --> 00:57:43,911
LIAM: Which is a big seven.

932
00:57:43,911 --> 00:57:50,629
MATT: Seven points of damage to it. All right. One
is destroyed. You rush forward and stab the other

933
00:57:50,629 --> 00:57:54,492
one. It's hard to push through the Wind Wall to
even get to its form. You do manage to find

934
00:57:54,492 --> 00:58:00,821
purchase. It takes some damage. That ends your
turn. It is now its turn. It moves into both of

935
00:58:00,821 --> 00:58:04,327
your spaces now, we'll say up against the two of
you there--

936
00:58:04,327 --> 00:58:06,357
MARISHA: Can it do that?

937
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:10,337
MATT: --and it's going to (whoosh) into a
whirlwind. Yeah, it can. It's an air elemental.

938
00:58:10,337 --> 00:58:11,880
MARISHA: It can move through the wind?

939
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:17,033
MATT: The Wind Wall? It can fly up and over. It
has 90 speed.

940
00:58:17,033 --> 00:58:24,007
MARISHA: Keep going. I'm going to cross-reference
that. Keep going.

941
00:58:24,007 --> 00:58:27,503
MATT: Because the Wind Wall itself, if I recall--

942
00:58:27,503 --> 00:58:29,364
MARISHA: I'm just checking. Nah, keep going.

943
00:58:29,364 --> 00:58:33,114
MATT: I'm going to check now before I do all these
rolls.

944
00:58:33,114 --> 00:58:34,451
MARISHA: See how tall it is.

945
00:58:34,451 --> 00:58:36,713
MATT: It is 15 feet high.

946
00:58:36,713 --> 00:58:38,048
MARISHA: All right, yep.

947
00:58:38,048 --> 00:58:39,333
TALIESIN: Dueling dictionaries.

948
00:58:39,333 --> 00:58:47,464
MARISHA: Nope. It is 15 feet high. You're correct.
He hops the fence.

949
00:58:47,464 --> 00:58:52,447
MATT: It does (hissing wind) and swirls around in
a whirlwind between the two of you. I need both of

950
00:58:52,447 --> 00:58:54,254
you guys to make strength saving throws.

951
00:58:54,254 --> 00:58:55,428
LIAM: Strength? Damn it.

952
00:58:55,428 --> 00:58:56,506
MARISHA: Who, me?

953
00:58:56,506 --> 00:58:57,924
MATT: Yeah. Keyleth and Vax.

954
00:58:57,924 --> 00:58:58,933
MARISHA: What? Strength?

955
00:58:58,933 --> 00:59:00,095
SAM: You have inspiration.

956
00:59:00,095 --> 00:59:06,879
LIAM: I'm going to use Luck. Ugh, screw you,
inspiration die! I mean, thank you for it, but

957
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:17,084
still, screw you! I'm going to use my inspiration
on top of that. Oh yay! 16?

958
00:59:17,084 --> 00:59:18,782
MARISHA: 19!

959
00:59:18,782 --> 00:59:21,998
MATT: Both of you guys succeed, so you take half
damage.

960
00:59:21,998 --> 00:59:23,256
LIAM: Damn it, Gil!

961
00:59:23,256 --> 00:59:24,817
MARISHA: Goddamn it, Gil!

962
00:59:24,817 --> 00:59:27,320
TALIESIN: Mine's been rocking. I don't know what
your problem is.

963
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:28,796
LAURA: Of course it has, Taliesin.

964
00:59:28,796 --> 00:59:31,075
MARISHA: You're an anomaly.

965
00:59:31,075 --> 00:59:32,800
LIAM: How much damage was that?

966
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:35,707
MATT: You both take six points of bludgeoning
damage.

967
00:59:35,707 --> 00:59:37,120
LIAM: Six, okay. I'm dead.

968
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:40,186
MATT: And you hold your ground. It doesn't fling
you about. It's not strong enough. It's wind, its

969
00:59:40,186 --> 00:59:45,171
smaller form unable to push both of you entirely
off your feet, so well done. That ends its turn.

970
00:59:45,171 --> 00:59:46,501
Vex, you're up.

971
00:59:46,501 --> 00:59:49,472
LAURA: Can I fly over it so that I can shoot down
onto it?

972
00:59:49,472 --> 00:59:50,649
MATT: You can, actually.

973
00:59:50,649 --> 00:59:53,894
LAURA: Then, as my bonus action, I'm going to have
Trinket run up and attack it.

974
00:59:53,894 --> 00:59:56,183
SAM: Whoa! Trinket attack something?

975
00:59:56,183 --> 01:00:01,159
MATT: You fly up enough where you have a view over
the Wind Wall and take two shots, and as a bonus

976
01:00:01,159 --> 01:00:05,480
action, Trinket will rush up and bite it.

977
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:07,105
LAURA: Yeah! Trinket's going to bite it.

978
01:00:07,105 --> 01:00:08,537
SAM: Bite the wind!

979
01:00:08,537 --> 01:00:12,719
LAURA: 26.

980
01:00:12,719 --> 01:00:14,965
MATT: 26 hits. Second attack.

981
01:00:14,965 --> 01:00:19,827
LAURA: 14 hit points for Trinket.

982
01:00:19,827 --> 01:00:25,771
MATT: 14. So that was Trinket's attack? 14 points
of damage from Trinket. Pushing forward and

983
01:00:25,771 --> 01:00:30,511
(growling) growling and biting through the middle
of it, mouth full of glass. It's not fun, but it

984
01:00:30,511 --> 01:00:31,759
does some damage.

985
01:00:31,759 --> 01:00:36,044
LAURA: 17 for my hit.

986
01:00:36,044 --> 01:00:37,356
MATT: Hits.

987
01:00:37,356 --> 01:00:42,696
LAURA: And then the next one hits. It's higher.

988
01:00:42,696 --> 01:00:44,779
MATT: Okay, so two hits. Roll damage on that.

989
01:00:44,779 --> 01:00:45,956
LAURA: Okay!

990
01:00:45,956 --> 01:00:54,015
TRAVIS: That's a lot of math.

991
01:00:54,015 --> 01:01:04,309
LAURA: I know. 20 points for the first one. Oh,
plus sneak attack! 24 points. Two of those are

992
01:01:04,309 --> 01:01:05,455
lightning.

993
01:01:05,455 --> 01:01:06,248
MATT: Nice.

994
01:01:06,248 --> 01:01:16,620
LAURA: (counting) 14, and then-- oh, I don't get
that that time. 14 points for the second one.

995
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:23,227
MATT: Up above, releasing two arrows. You see a
spark as they are released from the bow impacting

996
01:01:23,227 --> 01:01:28,970
into it. You see Trinket tear into its form. Every
now and then, you see an arm of Vax swing through

997
01:01:28,970 --> 01:01:35,380
and Keyleth's trying to push her way out of the
elemental. Right now, it's this mix of swirling

998
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:42,519
dirt and wind, but it's seemingly being worn down.
The speed in which it's swirling in its space is

999
01:01:42,519 --> 01:01:46,994
beginning to slow and images within its form are
getting easier and easier to see. That brings us

1000
01:01:46,994 --> 01:01:49,281
back to the top. Percival.

1001
01:01:49,281 --> 01:01:51,457
TALIESIN: How far away is it?

1002
01:01:51,457 --> 01:01:54,188
MATT: It's about 35 feet from you.

1003
01:01:54,188 --> 01:01:55,612
TRAVIS: Come on, wind killer.

1004
01:01:55,612 --> 01:01:59,393
TALIESIN: God, I'm going to pull out the gun and
start laying waste to it. I'm going to reload and

1005
01:01:59,393 --> 01:02:04,864
take two shots with Sharpshooter.

1006
01:02:04,864 --> 01:02:06,306
MATT: Okay.

1007
01:02:06,306 --> 01:02:19,705
TALIESIN: Oh no, now that jinxes it. See, that's
better. Look at that. That's lovely. 26 and 23.

1008
01:02:19,705 --> 01:02:22,110
MATT: Both hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

1009
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:25,288
TRAVIS: Somewhere else in the universe, the
balance is no more.

1010
01:02:25,288 --> 01:02:26,737
LIAM: Who's missed?

1011
01:02:26,737 --> 01:02:29,453
LAURA: Me. I missed. I rolled a one.

1012
01:02:29,453 --> 01:02:31,642
MARISHA: We wonder why there's the West Nile
virus.

1013
01:02:31,642 --> 01:02:39,963
TRAVIS: Because he got a roll. Thanks, Taliesin.
Thanks, Obama.

1014
01:02:39,963 --> 01:02:41,862
TALIESIN: 46 points of piercing damage.

1015
01:02:41,862 --> 01:02:42,912
MATT: 46 total?

1016
01:02:42,912 --> 01:02:43,786
TALIESIN: Yes.

1017
01:02:43,786 --> 01:02:45,122
MATT: These are all with Sharpshooter, right?

1018
01:02:45,122 --> 01:02:51,510
TALIESIN: There were two shots with Sharpshooter,
which is a base of 16 times two, so that's 32,

1019
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:55,526
plus I rolled a ten on that, which pushes it to 42
plus a four, so 46.

1020
01:02:55,526 --> 01:02:56,930
LIAM: Is that all?

1021
01:02:56,930 --> 01:03:05,615
MATT: Even halved from the impact, you manage to
blast the creature, its form hitting the Wind Wall

1022
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:11,924
and scattering against it. No longer physically
able to hold its form there, the elemental

1023
01:03:11,924 --> 01:03:13,582
dissipating into the sky in the end.

1024
01:03:13,582 --> 01:03:15,549
MARISHA: Percival, he who breaks wind.

1025
01:03:15,549 --> 01:03:17,852
(laughter)

1026
01:03:17,852 --> 01:03:23,113
TALIESIN: That was for you. Now I feel guilty.

1027
01:03:23,113 --> 01:03:29,506
MATT: As you all take a moment to catch your
breath and look around, everyone roll a perception check.

1028
01:03:29,506 --> 01:03:31,962
LIAM: Natural 20!

1029
01:03:31,962 --> 01:03:34,427
SAM: Natural 20!

1030
01:03:34,427 --> 01:03:40,919
TALIESIN: Natural one! I'm cleaning my gun. I'm
not even looking.

1031
01:03:40,919 --> 01:03:43,842
SAM: Wow. Two 20s, two ones so far.

1032
01:03:43,842 --> 01:03:45,989
LAURA: 22.

1033
01:03:45,989 --> 01:03:47,439
MARISHA: 15. Right in the middle.

1034
01:03:47,439 --> 01:03:55,708
MATT: You guys take a moment and glance around. It
appears that whatever disturbed wind brought this

1035
01:03:55,708 --> 01:04:00,648
sudden attack on has dissipated, and the creatures
you've slaughtered have brought this calm

1036
01:04:00,648 --> 01:04:07,706
stillness to the beach. All you can hear around
you is the occasional (wave sound) of the water up

1037
01:04:07,706 --> 01:04:14,353
on the shore. It does not appear that there is any
immediate danger on the beach.

1038
01:04:14,353 --> 01:04:19,579
MARISHA: I suddenly remember the letters that I
stole from the ship, and I say: Percival! And I

1039
01:04:19,579 --> 01:04:21,029
pull them out.

1040
01:04:21,029 --> 01:04:22,201
TALIESIN: Thank you.

1041
01:04:22,201 --> 01:04:27,235
MARISHA: I'm not giving them to you! I'm going to
look at them with you.

1042
01:04:27,235 --> 01:04:42,037
MATT: They are sketches and designs, one of which
is of a more refined pepperbox.

1043
01:04:42,037 --> 01:04:46,307
MARISHA: Okay, upon looking at them, I don't get
it, and I hand them to him.

1044
01:04:46,307 --> 01:04:52,864
MATT: Okay. You glance through. There are other
variations of Retort, the pistol that she had

1045
01:04:52,864 --> 01:05:01,411
before. You also see a few very complete sketches
of a Bad News rebuild. Not as good. Even looking

1046
01:05:01,411 --> 01:05:06,106
at the design, you can see a few faults in it that
prevent it from being as powerful as what you've

1047
01:05:06,106 --> 01:05:13,419
created. Nevertheless, it is a fairly high-powered
rifle-like weapon. Beneath them, you see notes of

1048
01:05:13,419 --> 01:05:23,998
five constructed, and then it's erased, two on
hand.

1049
01:05:23,998 --> 01:05:28,923
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm putting this away and not
thinking about this for a little while.

1050
01:05:28,923 --> 01:05:33,494
MATT: It's like a ledger keeping tabs of each
thing that she's created.

1051
01:05:33,494 --> 01:05:34,860
MARISHA: That was for Bad News?

1052
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:38,469
TALIESIN: I believe that was for Bad-- no, it's
the pepperbox, I believe.

1053
01:05:38,469 --> 01:05:41,051
LIAM: I want to take a little run towards the
water and then shoot out and do what I was trying

1054
01:05:41,051 --> 01:05:42,232
to do before.

1055
01:05:42,232 --> 01:05:43,487
MATT: Okay, so (fluttering).

1056
01:05:43,487 --> 01:05:49,381
TALIESIN: Scanlan, can you use your very, very
delicate sword and put some very, very gentle

1057
01:05:49,381 --> 01:05:51,300
difficult-to-see holes in both of these boats?

1058
01:05:51,300 --> 01:06:04,763
SAM: Sure. I'm a master swordsman. I draw my
blade. Talk to me, baby.

1059
01:06:04,763 --> 01:06:06,491
TRAVIS: Talk to me, Goose.

1060
01:06:06,491 --> 01:06:15,784
MATT: As you say "baby," the voice has this,
"baby," this low tuning fork vibration hits the

1061
01:06:15,784 --> 01:06:19,901
blade. As you begin to go nuts on this ship, you
guys watch as splinters of wood go flying.

1062
01:06:19,901 --> 01:06:24,405
TALIESIN: That was not what I had in mind!
Straight, delicate stabbing.

1063
01:06:24,405 --> 01:06:25,919
SAM: Oh, great. Yes.

1064
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:32,133
MATT: You put quite a number of pincushion-like
blows to the exterior of the ship's bow. Neither

1065
01:06:32,133 --> 01:06:34,814
of these will last much in the water.

1066
01:06:34,814 --> 01:06:39,633
TALIESIN: Did we actually end up searching the
boats for everything, or did we not end up

1067
01:06:39,633 --> 01:06:40,948
searching the boats for everything?

1068
01:06:40,948 --> 01:06:42,492
MATT: You were about to when this happened.

1069
01:06:42,492 --> 01:06:52,255
SAM: Wait, those elementals that we fought-- were
they left by Ripley? Was it a trap? Did we

1070
01:06:52,255 --> 01:06:55,992
activate a trap? Is she close by? She can't have
gotten far.

1071
01:06:55,992 --> 01:07:03,110
LAURA: It looks like she dragged whatever she
found further into the island. Can I call Trinket

1072
01:07:03,110 --> 01:07:05,877
over and then look at the tracks and see if he
smells anybody and see where they took

1073
01:07:05,877 --> 01:07:06,744
everything?

1074
01:07:06,744 --> 01:07:07,820
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1075
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:09,208
TALIESIN: Does anyone else want to take a short
rest?

1076
01:07:09,208 --> 01:07:12,291
MARISHA: Do we have time?

1077
01:07:12,291 --> 01:07:13,981
TALIESIN: Where's she going?

1078
01:07:13,981 --> 01:07:17,928
SAM: What if she's teleporting out of here?

1079
01:07:17,928 --> 01:07:20,163
LAURA: 15 for me. Should I roll for Trinket, too,
for his smell perception?

1080
01:07:20,163 --> 01:07:23,448
MATT: Yeah. Well this is investigation.

1081
01:07:23,448 --> 01:07:26,354
LAURA: Oh, okay. I was seeing if he could catch
their scent.

1082
01:07:26,354 --> 01:07:28,654
MATT: Yeah, then roll a perception check for
Trinket.

1083
01:07:28,654 --> 01:07:36,355
LAURA: And he's got advantage on smell. 25.

1084
01:07:36,355 --> 01:07:43,336
MATT: As you're looking about, you see the tracks.
You also see in some of the grooves where this

1085
01:07:43,336 --> 01:07:50,235
heavy object was being dragged, you see one
portion where it's dragged up, or seems to have

1086
01:07:50,235 --> 01:07:55,601
been dragged up onto a shelf, like a very small
six-inch shelf of glass. You can see a scrape and

1087
01:07:55,601 --> 01:08:01,038
some splinters of wood. Whatever was being dragged
appears to be wooden and part of it was very, very

1088
01:08:01,038 --> 01:08:04,745
faintly damaged when it was dragged up onto the
shelf. So you know you're looking for something

1089
01:08:04,745 --> 01:08:12,843
made of wood. The wood slivers, as you look at
them, they're a little swollen and damp.

1090
01:08:12,843 --> 01:08:14,354
LAURA: Waterlogged, for sure.

1091
01:08:14,354 --> 01:08:22,050
MATT: Whatever these were, they were underwater
for a period of time. Trinket goes, (sniffing,

1092
01:08:22,050 --> 01:08:28,625
growling) and leans the head forward towards the
jungle.

1093
01:08:28,625 --> 01:08:29,772
TALIESIN: All right.

1094
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:38,133
LAURA: You also have that dog. They can maybe team
up and have extra-strong smell perception. Or we

1095
01:08:38,133 --> 01:08:39,158
can save it.

1096
01:08:39,158 --> 01:08:41,536
SAM: I don't know why I'm saying this, but I trust
Trinket.

1097
01:08:41,536 --> 01:08:44,517
TALIESIN: You want to keep the dog for later,
don't you?

1098
01:08:44,517 --> 01:08:45,804
SAM: Yes.

1099
01:08:45,804 --> 01:08:47,649
(laughter)

1100
01:08:47,649 --> 01:08:53,985
SAM: Wait, should I heal you, Percy?

1101
01:08:53,985 --> 01:08:56,696
TALIESIN: That would be lovely. I'm bleeding over
everything.

1102
01:08:56,696 --> 01:08:59,778
LAURA: Oh, well, I'll do one, too.

1103
01:08:59,778 --> 01:09:01,821
LIAM: Heal his face. His face is cut up, I say
over the earring.

1104
01:09:01,821 --> 01:09:03,366
TALIESIN: That is so kind of you to say.

1105
01:09:03,366 --> 01:09:10,278
SAM: I'll heal everything but his face. Let's see
here.

1106
01:09:10,278 --> 01:09:11,373
LAURA: Do you have a strong heal?

1107
01:09:11,373 --> 01:09:12,618
SAM: No, I'm terrible. It's tiny.

1108
01:09:12,618 --> 01:09:20,704
LAURA: All right. I'll do a 2nd-level, and I'll
touch your face so I can heal all the little glass

1109
01:09:20,704 --> 01:09:21,913
shardy things.

1110
01:09:21,913 --> 01:09:23,380
TALIESIN: Oh, thank you. Ow.

1111
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:30,947
SAM: I will do a 2nd-level Healing Word, as well.
Which is what, 2d4?

1112
01:09:30,947 --> 01:09:32,665
MATT: 2d4 plus six.

1113
01:09:32,665 --> 01:09:42,566
TALIESIN: That's nine. Nine is good. I'm a little
better.

1114
01:09:42,566 --> 01:09:43,855
LAURA: 17 for me.

1115
01:09:43,855 --> 01:09:45,339
TALIESIN: Thank you.

1116
01:09:45,339 --> 01:09:53,147
SAM: Oh, wait! Before we charge off into the
jungle, didn't you get a shit-ton of potions? Can

1117
01:09:53,147 --> 01:09:54,231
you hand those out, please?

1118
01:09:54,231 --> 01:09:55,413
LAURA: Yeah, totally.

1119
01:09:55,413 --> 01:10:00,299
LIAM: Am I seeing anything out on the water?

1120
01:10:00,299 --> 01:10:09,856
MATT: The ship is sunk. You do not see anybody
currently swimming in the water. Make a perception check.

1121
01:10:09,856 --> 01:10:13,578
LIAM: That is a 22.

1122
01:10:13,578 --> 01:10:20,534
MATT: 22? Looking about, you can see the bits of
the reef that are slightly visible through the

1123
01:10:20,534 --> 01:10:26,152
murky water surface here in the bay, but the ship
is gone. You can see bits of floating broken wood

1124
01:10:26,152 --> 01:10:29,605
from the impact of the ship. It's probably going
to end up as driftwood on the beach itself. No

1125
01:10:29,605 --> 01:10:31,163
sign of any survivors.

1126
01:10:31,163 --> 01:10:34,402
LIAM: All right. I'll shoot back.

1127
01:10:34,402 --> 01:10:36,813
MATT: You do see two figures out towards it that
are floating in the water face-down.

1128
01:10:36,813 --> 01:10:38,400
LIAM: Oh yeah?

1129
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,825
SAM: Check them for traps.

1130
01:10:39,825 --> 01:10:42,136
LIAM: I'm going to go drag them back.

1131
01:10:42,136 --> 01:10:48,565
MATT: Okay. You're not going to be able to drag
both of them with the wings.

1132
01:10:48,565 --> 01:10:49,749
LIAM: But one, I can?

1133
01:10:49,749 --> 01:10:50,791
MATT: One you could, yeah.

1134
01:10:50,791 --> 01:10:51,813
LIAM: I will drag one back.

1135
01:10:51,813 --> 01:10:55,388
MARISHA: Oh, you're going to drag my shame into
shore?

1136
01:10:55,388 --> 01:10:56,711
MATT: Basically, yeah.

1137
01:10:56,711 --> 01:11:01,084
LIAM: Your shame? You mean your pride. I drag one
back.

1138
01:11:01,084 --> 01:11:05,027
MATT: All right. You grab one, and it's hard. You
can barely get any lift, especially since he's so

1139
01:11:05,027 --> 01:11:06,707
soaked with the water, it's an extra weight.

1140
01:11:06,707 --> 01:11:09,834
LIAM: Can I stay close to the surface of the
water?

1141
01:11:09,834 --> 01:11:12,350
MATT: I will ask you to go ahead and make an
athletics check.

1142
01:11:12,350 --> 01:11:13,474
LIAM: All right.

1143
01:11:13,474 --> 01:11:17,959
LAURA: Scanlan, take a greater and a regular
healing potion. Percy, take a greater and a

1144
01:11:17,959 --> 01:11:19,039
regular.

1145
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:19,815
LIAM: Just an 11.

1146
01:11:19,815 --> 01:11:24,496
MATT: You're barely able to keep from being
dragged into the water. It takes you a while to

1147
01:11:24,496 --> 01:11:30,754
get there, because he doesn't ever actually leave
the water, you're pulling him through it as you

1148
01:11:30,754 --> 01:11:34,795
go. It takes you about 15 minutes to get him into
shore if you do.

1149
01:11:34,795 --> 01:11:40,307
LIAM: I'm going to imagine that my wings bamf out
soon after that.

1150
01:11:40,307 --> 01:11:43,166
MATT: Yeah, you're getting pretty close to the end
of your time with those.

1151
01:11:43,166 --> 01:11:45,318
LIAM: I'm going to search him. He's dead, yeah?

1152
01:11:45,318 --> 01:11:51,164
MATT: Yes. Make an investigation check. You guys
watch as Vax swings in with the wings, dragging a

1153
01:11:51,164 --> 01:11:55,479
waterlogged seemingly unconscious or dead body,
throws it onto the beach and begins rifling

1154
01:11:55,479 --> 01:11:56,432
through the pockets.

1155
01:11:56,432 --> 01:11:57,444
TRAVIS: Ooh, what'd you find?

1156
01:11:57,444 --> 01:11:59,320
LIAM: That is a 22.

1157
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:04,723
MATT: 22. You find 145 gold pieces.

1158
01:12:04,723 --> 01:12:06,431
SAM: Oh, hello!

1159
01:12:06,431 --> 01:12:08,532
LIAM: That's the first gold I've had in ages.

1160
01:12:08,532 --> 01:12:19,464
MATT: You find a spyglass, and you find two small
reddish-purple stones that are perfectly spherical

1161
01:12:19,464 --> 01:12:20,527
in the pocket.

1162
01:12:20,527 --> 01:12:24,831
SAM: What is that all about? (whispering) They
were playing marbles.

1163
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:29,070
LIAM: All right.

1164
01:12:29,070 --> 01:12:30,635
MATT: Okay. That's all you find.

1165
01:12:30,635 --> 01:12:32,387
TRAVIS: What's that thingy? Pointing to the
spyglass.

1166
01:12:32,387 --> 01:12:36,659
LIAM: That's a-- you know what that is. Percival,
what is that?

1167
01:12:36,659 --> 01:12:43,078
TALIESIN: It's a spyglass, I assume. Yes, here.
You can look through and you can see that

1168
01:12:43,078 --> 01:12:44,999
everything is very far away.

1169
01:12:44,999 --> 01:12:50,334
SAM: It looks small now. Everything looks tiny.

1170
01:12:50,334 --> 01:12:51,891
TALIESIN: Just like you. Thank you.

1171
01:12:51,891 --> 01:12:53,391
MARISHA: So wait, what are the two marbles?

1172
01:12:53,391 --> 01:12:55,260
LIAM: That I've got in my pocket?

1173
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:58,962
LAURA: Can you pass the spyglass over? I think
that would be great on the broom.

1174
01:12:58,962 --> 01:13:00,462
TALIESIN: I think that's a good idea.

1175
01:13:00,462 --> 01:13:02,204
LAURA: I'm going to keep this spyglass.

1176
01:13:02,204 --> 01:13:04,028
LIAM: Isn't that for looking through?

1177
01:13:04,028 --> 01:13:07,531
TRAVIS: Do you have one of those on your big Bad
News?

1178
01:13:07,531 --> 01:13:11,199
TALIESIN: I do. It's not quite as powerful as
that, although that is an interesting idea. I

1179
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:12,411
might play with that later.

1180
01:13:12,411 --> 01:13:16,316
LAURA: Ooh, can I fly up in the air and look
through it? Down at the ground. See what I see.

1181
01:13:16,316 --> 01:13:18,654
MATT: Fly up, glance out. Make a perception
check.

1182
01:13:18,654 --> 01:13:21,510
LAURA: Do I get advantage because of the
spyglass?

1183
01:13:21,510 --> 01:13:26,237
MATT: The DC will change based on what you're
looking for.

1184
01:13:26,237 --> 01:13:31,937
LIAM: I take the two small stones and I look over
at Percival and Keyleth and go--

1185
01:13:31,937 --> 01:13:34,368
(laughter)

1186
01:13:34,368 --> 01:13:39,787
LIAM: Those look valuable to you?

1187
01:13:39,787 --> 01:13:41,029
LAURA: 24.

1188
01:13:41,029 --> 01:13:42,244
MARISHA: They look like rocks!

1189
01:13:42,244 --> 01:13:47,371
MATT: You have a closer look of the canopy of this
jungle. You basically make out the same details

1190
01:13:47,371 --> 01:13:51,979
that Grog did earlier. There are bits of green.
There are bits of live tree here and there, but

1191
01:13:51,979 --> 01:13:53,255
most of it's dark and dead.

1192
01:13:53,255 --> 01:13:58,936
LAURA: What if I follow from where the path that I
saw them dragging, and I follow through the trees?

1193
01:13:58,936 --> 01:14:06,087
Can I see a path inward from there?

1194
01:14:06,087 --> 01:14:10,210
MATT: You see from this distance, there is
occasionally a break in the jungle, or a path that

1195
01:14:10,210 --> 01:14:17,179
could be taken that isn't completely overgrown and
too thick to walk through, but that's all you can

1196
01:14:17,179 --> 01:14:18,705
make out from this distance.

1197
01:14:18,705 --> 01:14:20,959
TALIESIN: That'll do. I'm examining one of the red
rocks. Does it look like anything? The red circle

1198
01:14:20,959 --> 01:14:21,862
spheres.

1199
01:14:21,862 --> 01:14:30,985
MATT: It looks almost like a polished red quartz,
imperfect. You can see texture cracks or layers of

1200
01:14:30,985 --> 01:14:35,969
a natural forming quartz-like material on the
inside.

1201
01:14:35,969 --> 01:14:38,844
MARISHA: So it's like a stone? Is it pretty?

1202
01:14:38,844 --> 01:14:40,429
MATT: It's like a larger marble of stone.

1203
01:14:40,429 --> 01:14:44,176
LAURA: Are they magic?

1204
01:14:44,176 --> 01:14:45,149
TALIESIN: Probably.

1205
01:14:45,149 --> 01:14:46,680
LAURA: Can we arcane them? Arcane check?

1206
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:50,609
SAM: I'll take a look at these for arcana.

1207
01:14:50,609 --> 01:14:52,197
MATT: Make an arcana check.

1208
01:14:52,197 --> 01:14:53,449
LAURA: No, Grog. Don't eat it.

1209
01:14:53,449 --> 01:14:54,342
LIAM: You can have it.

1210
01:14:54,342 --> 01:14:56,878
SAM: Oh! 19, plus stuff. Plus seven.

1211
01:14:56,878 --> 01:15:03,734
MATT: These don't get used too often. They're
usually used more in emergency nautical

1212
01:15:03,734 --> 01:15:13,681
circumstances, or used as a means of gaining
attention. It's called a flare stone, and

1213
01:15:13,681 --> 01:15:19,463
essentially they're impacted hard, and then thrown
high, and they turn into a flare.

1214
01:15:19,463 --> 01:15:24,406
LAURA: Is that what we saw? Oh, so he wasn't a
magic user.

1215
01:15:24,406 --> 01:15:25,539
MARISHA: That's cool.

1216
01:15:25,539 --> 01:15:26,732
TALIESIN: Well, he was, because he was starting a
spell.

1217
01:15:26,732 --> 01:15:30,265
MARISHA: They're flares. That's cool.

1218
01:15:30,265 --> 01:15:31,880
LIAM: Hey, pass that back. That's mine.

1219
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:34,508
TALIESIN: We should spread them out. Everyone
should not have--

1220
01:15:34,508 --> 01:15:36,003
LAURA: I take the purple one, you take the red
one?

1221
01:15:36,003 --> 01:15:36,903
LIAM: No, you take them both.

1222
01:15:36,903 --> 01:15:37,848
LAURA: Why do I take them both?

1223
01:15:37,848 --> 01:15:38,765
LIAM: You've got the broom.

1224
01:15:38,765 --> 01:15:41,294
TALIESIN: You'd need one, and someone else take
the other.

1225
01:15:41,294 --> 01:15:43,649
LAURA: I'll keep the purple one.

1226
01:15:43,649 --> 01:15:48,024
TALIESIN: Let the twins have them, because they're
the ones who will get separated.

1227
01:15:48,024 --> 01:15:50,177
MARISHA: That was the perfect interaction.

1228
01:15:50,177 --> 01:15:51,517
TRAVIS: Grog remembers that.

1229
01:15:51,517 --> 01:15:54,558
(laughter)

1230
01:15:54,558 --> 01:16:03,928
TALIESIN: It's a way to call for help, Grog. I
don't think you're going to need it very often.

1231
01:16:03,928 --> 01:16:07,128
TRAVIS: I take off sullenly towards the trees.

1232
01:16:07,128 --> 01:16:09,431
TALIESIN: I'm going to follow. He's got the right
idea.

1233
01:16:09,431 --> 01:16:16,007
MATT: Trinket catches up to you. Trinket's running
alongside you, following the smell (sniffing). You

1234
01:16:16,007 --> 01:16:17,938
guys watch? Is everyone--

1235
01:16:17,938 --> 01:16:19,065
TALIESIN: I'm going.

1236
01:16:19,065 --> 01:16:23,437
MATT: Okay. All right. You guys push forward,
reaching the treeline, and then pushing into the

1237
01:16:23,437 --> 01:16:32,084
jungle itself. The smell of the saltwater air
gives way to now the smell of ash and burnt

1238
01:16:32,084 --> 01:16:39,269
forest, but old, very faint. It's less of a recent
burn and more an ever-present scent of dead brush.

1239
01:16:39,269 --> 01:16:49,021
You do catch the occasional sour smell of a
tropical flower. You do see bursts of ground brush

1240
01:16:49,021 --> 01:16:54,558
and living plant life that has pushed through the
glass and is slowly retaking the island over time.

1241
01:16:54,558 --> 01:16:57,107
MARISHA: Can I keep an eye out for that flower?

1242
01:16:57,107 --> 01:17:05,120
MATT: Yeah, and you see it a few times. It has a
yellowish milky-white color to it, and it has a

1243
01:17:05,218 --> 01:17:14,481
vibrant purple stamen that protrudes from it. It's
almost a sour milk-type smell. It's not very

1244
01:17:14,571 --> 01:17:15,689
pleasant.

1245
01:17:15,689 --> 01:17:17,968
MARISHA: I grab a few, put them in my bag.

1246
01:17:17,968 --> 01:17:24,228
MATT: Okay. You continue pushing through the
petrified forests. You guys pick up, and Trinket

1247
01:17:24,228 --> 01:17:30,801
picks up, as well, as you're pushing on for
another 150 feet or so, you start noticing broken

1248
01:17:30,801 --> 01:17:36,364
branches. You see little elements that you're used
to in tracking movement from individuals. You can

1249
01:17:36,364 --> 01:17:41,197
see what are sheer signs of heavy footfalls,
occasionally another grinding along the ground. It

1250
01:17:41,197 --> 01:17:47,005
looks like whatever was being dragged has now been
seemingly picked up, or is now leaving less of an

1251
01:17:47,005 --> 01:17:53,651
impact. It has more people now working towards
moving it. That groove is subtly vanishing as it

1252
01:17:53,651 --> 01:17:57,956
progresses, but you do see signs of people pushing
through the jungle at a rapid pace.

1253
01:17:57,956 --> 01:17:59,541
LIAM: Are the twins quietly in the lead?

1254
01:17:59,541 --> 01:18:05,199
MATT: Right now, it's Grog and Trinket in the
lead. If you guys want to change up marching order

1255
01:18:05,199 --> 01:18:07,951
for this, let's do it.

1256
01:18:07,951 --> 01:18:12,259
LIAM: Yeah. Buddy, bud, you're very big and large
and amazing. What do you want?

1257
01:18:12,259 --> 01:18:14,227
LAURA: He wants one of those balls to put in his
butt.

1258
01:18:14,227 --> 01:18:20,772
LIAM: I give him a small piece of glass from the
ground and I put it in his hand, then I run up

1259
01:18:20,772 --> 01:18:21,842
ahead.

1260
01:18:21,842 --> 01:18:24,326
TRAVIS: I grab his collar. I pull him back.

1261
01:18:24,326 --> 01:18:26,914
LIAM: Try it, buddy!

1262
01:18:26,914 --> 01:18:28,272
(laughter)

1263
01:18:28,272 --> 01:18:36,200
LIAM: Give me a dexterity check, Matthew.

1264
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:42,467
MATT: Make a strength check, or an athletics
check, Grog. You make an acrobatics check.

1265
01:18:42,467 --> 01:18:46,006
LIAM: All right. Acrobatics. Yeah, that's fine.

1266
01:18:46,006 --> 01:18:46,820
TRAVIS: 25.

1267
01:18:46,820 --> 01:18:47,976
LIAM: 30.

1268
01:18:47,976 --> 01:18:49,538
SAM: You still have inspiration, Grog.

1269
01:18:49,538 --> 01:18:55,868
TRAVIS: Oh, I do! 35.

1270
01:18:55,868 --> 01:18:57,993
(yelling)

1271
01:18:57,993 --> 01:19:01,540
LIAM: Wait! I'm going to use luck. No, didn't go
up.

1272
01:19:01,540 --> 01:19:05,979
MATT: You dart forward, grinning, as you just left
him behind and all of a sudden, you feel your hood

1273
01:19:05,979 --> 01:19:11,980
go (choking) and choke you from behind as Grog's
holding it and pulls you back to him.

1274
01:19:11,980 --> 01:19:13,462
TRAVIS: What is your rush?

1275
01:19:13,462 --> 01:19:17,257
LIAM: (hoarsely) Fine, take the lead. I'm keeping
the stone, dick.

1276
01:19:17,257 --> 01:19:18,500
TRAVIS: Fine.

1277
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:20,369
LIAM: (hoarsely) Right this way, stealthy
motherfucker.

1278
01:19:20,369 --> 01:19:24,444
TRAVIS: I start stomping extra loud as I walk.

1279
01:19:24,444 --> 01:19:25,507
LAURA: Grog, please don't stomp.

1280
01:19:25,507 --> 01:19:29,801
TRAVIS: Really make it like little bits of salt
and pepper beneath my feet.

1281
01:19:29,801 --> 01:19:31,984
MATT: Glass is cracking and breaking beneath his
footfalls.

1282
01:19:31,984 --> 01:19:34,153
LAURA: That is not okay.

1283
01:19:34,153 --> 01:19:45,652
TALIESIN: I just had this weird thought. Do I
smell anything? Do I taste anything in the air? Is

1284
01:19:45,652 --> 01:19:55,863
there minerals? I had this horrifying notion. Are
there signs that this island has even been vaguely

1285
01:19:55,863 --> 01:20:00,145
inhabited at all, recently? How many people does
it feel like are here?

1286
01:20:00,145 --> 01:20:04,784
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

1287
01:20:04,784 --> 01:20:06,427
TALIESIN: See if you're going where I'm going on
this.

1288
01:20:06,427 --> 01:20:08,150
MARISHA: Yeah, I second that question.

1289
01:20:08,150 --> 01:20:12,850
TALIESIN: 12 straight.

1290
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:22,329
MATT: It's hard to tell. From the beach, the only
sign of any activity that hasn't been washed away

1291
01:20:22,329 --> 01:20:28,086
by the elements was the campsite that you saw, and
that was relatively fresh. You gather probably

1292
01:20:28,086 --> 01:20:33,294
from the rather rapid rate of rainfall that storms
through this area that a lot of any sign would be

1293
01:20:33,294 --> 01:20:39,150
washed away over time. However, you guys flew over
in the skyship, and as you cased the island, you

1294
01:20:39,150 --> 01:20:44,565
did not see any pockets with villages. You didn't
see areas of the jungle that have been harvested

1295
01:20:44,565 --> 01:20:45,623
for resources.

1296
01:20:45,623 --> 01:20:50,898
TALIESIN: I'm going to keep my senses aware as
possible for the signs of a mining operation.

1297
01:20:50,898 --> 01:20:52,283
MATT: Okay.

1298
01:20:52,283 --> 01:20:56,231
MARISHA: And can I keep my senses aware for
aboriginals of the island?

1299
01:20:56,231 --> 01:21:02,958
MATT: Okay. So you guys are keeping tabs on
anything around you that might be a sign?

1300
01:21:02,958 --> 01:21:06,601
LAURA: I'm keeping my senses aware for if Ripley's
invisible and is around us.

1301
01:21:06,601 --> 01:21:07,562
MATT: Okay.

1302
01:21:07,562 --> 01:21:08,909
SAM: I am looking for literally nothing.

1303
01:21:08,909 --> 01:21:11,067
TALIESIN: And you find it.

1304
01:21:11,067 --> 01:21:16,493
MATT: I will guess in this point, one: everyone
roll a stealth check, if you're stealthing

1305
01:21:16,493 --> 01:21:17,649
forward.

1306
01:21:17,649 --> 01:21:18,979
TRAVIS: I'm looking for rabbits.

1307
01:21:18,979 --> 01:21:22,021
MATT: Glass rabbits.

1308
01:21:22,021 --> 01:21:23,191
MARISHA: Natural 20.

1309
01:21:23,191 --> 01:21:25,207
TRAVIS: Hey, 17.

1310
01:21:25,207 --> 01:21:27,726
TALIESIN: 14.

1311
01:21:27,726 --> 01:21:29,574
SAM: Seven.

1312
01:21:29,574 --> 01:21:30,749
LIAM: 25.

1313
01:21:30,749 --> 01:21:31,935
LAURA: 28.

1314
01:21:31,935 --> 01:21:38,771
MATT: All right. The half-elves catch up on this.
As you're making your way towards this knotted

1315
01:21:38,771 --> 01:21:47,022
section of the jungle. This is the stealth check,
right? Yeah. You guys are pushing forward, you

1316
01:21:47,022 --> 01:21:52,731
guys without a single touch of sound. A little bit
from Scanlan, but as the bulk, you guys manage to

1317
01:21:52,731 --> 01:22:00,766
stop him and as a group, push forward, you
imagine, fairly unseen. Pretty proud of Vox

1318
01:22:00,766 --> 01:22:07,772
Machina. Grog, especially, being the one that
stomped forward. You continue to push forward.

1319
01:22:07,772 --> 01:22:13,083
Everyone make a perception check.

1320
01:22:13,083 --> 01:22:17,447
SAM: All right, new dice. Three.

1321
01:22:17,447 --> 01:22:19,104
TALIESIN: Ten.

1322
01:22:19,104 --> 01:22:20,510
MARISHA: 22.

1323
01:22:20,510 --> 01:22:21,483
LIAM: 26.

1324
01:22:21,483 --> 01:22:23,298
LAURA: Ooh. 30.

1325
01:22:23,298 --> 01:22:24,350
TRAVIS: Six.

1326
01:22:24,350 --> 01:22:30,175
MATT: The half-elves, once again coming through
with the skill checks. You guys, being quiet and

1327
01:22:30,175 --> 01:22:36,799
being careful and methodical in pushing past brush
without damaging anything, Vex keeping an eye on

1328
01:22:36,799 --> 01:22:40,469
signs of movement, and the more you push forward,
you start seeing some of the branches that are

1329
01:22:40,469 --> 01:22:44,621
broken have less dust or general settling material
on them. You're coming upon something relatively

1330
01:22:44,621 --> 01:22:45,913
recent.

1331
01:22:45,913 --> 01:22:47,036
TRAVIS: Question!

1332
01:22:47,036 --> 01:22:47,881
MATT: Yes?

1333
01:22:47,881 --> 01:22:49,102
TRAVIS: Is the ground still covered in glass?

1334
01:22:49,102 --> 01:22:54,366
MATT: There are bits of dried brush, but there is
still a very glass-based floor here.

1335
01:22:54,366 --> 01:22:56,038
LAURA: Is it broken glass or smooth glass?

1336
01:22:56,038 --> 01:23:00,837
MATT: There are sections of it that are smooth.
There are sections that are broken. You can see

1337
01:23:00,837 --> 01:23:05,802
the further in you get, the less that it appears
to be a jagged, broken experience. But it does

1338
01:23:05,802 --> 01:23:07,717
vary, depending.

1339
01:23:07,717 --> 01:23:09,776
LIAM: But we can navigate through?

1340
01:23:09,776 --> 01:23:10,998
MATT: You can navigate through carefully as you
move.

1341
01:23:10,998 --> 01:23:13,791
MARISHA: And does the vegetation seem to be
getting thicker?

1342
01:23:13,791 --> 01:23:18,525
MATT: It's pretty thick. There's small breaks here
and there, but for the most part, there aren't

1343
01:23:18,525 --> 01:23:23,689
carved paths through the jungle here. There's
natural clearings, and you guys have to find your

1344
01:23:23,689 --> 01:23:28,233
way through. Sometimes it gets tight and you have
to move around some of the larger trees, but

1345
01:23:28,233 --> 01:23:31,239
you're able to navigate without a huge issue. It's
not terribly choked off.

1346
01:23:31,239 --> 01:23:40,300
The half-elves, as you guys are quietly pulling
forward, you pick up on what sounds like whispers.

1347
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:46,469
Hushed voices, at least. What do you do?

1348
01:23:46,469 --> 01:23:52,639
LAURA: I have a couple vials of poison. Can I dip
a few arrows in the poison?

1349
01:23:52,639 --> 01:23:53,872
MATT: Sure.

1350
01:23:53,872 --> 01:23:55,773
LAURA: Does that make poison arrows?

1351
01:23:55,773 --> 01:23:58,423
MATT: The arrows would be poison, yes.

1352
01:23:58,423 --> 01:24:08,643
LIAM: I will come back, I promise. Do you want me
to go look? I'll come back. I'll just go look, I

1353
01:24:08,643 --> 01:24:10,155
promise.

1354
01:24:10,155 --> 01:24:11,351
MARISHA: (whispering) You got this.

1355
01:24:11,351 --> 01:24:13,583
LAURA: (whispering) Be as quiet as fucking
possible.

1356
01:24:13,583 --> 01:24:15,408
MARISHA: (whispering) I believe in you.

1357
01:24:15,408 --> 01:24:17,534
TRAVIS: (whispering) They can't hear any of that
stuff when you're that quiet.

1358
01:24:17,534 --> 01:24:19,273
SAM: (whispering) I don't know what's going on.

1359
01:24:19,273 --> 01:24:24,179
LIAM: I'm going to stealth my way forward.

1360
01:24:24,179 --> 01:24:28,001
TALIESIN: (quietly) We can stage whisper.

1361
01:24:28,001 --> 01:24:29,905
MATT: Roll a new stealth check.

1362
01:24:29,905 --> 01:24:32,219
SAM: (quietly) There's no one really listening to
us, so we can talk as loud as we want.

1363
01:24:32,219 --> 01:24:33,973
MARISHA: (quietly) But there might be.

1364
01:24:33,973 --> 01:24:36,416
LIAM: 31.

1365
01:24:36,416 --> 01:24:41,203
MATT: Okay. So you guys are all staying behind.
What's the marching order, by the way, you guys

1366
01:24:41,203 --> 01:24:42,444
are currently in?

1367
01:24:42,444 --> 01:24:43,805
LAURA: I'm going to be behind him.

1368
01:24:43,805 --> 01:24:45,945
MATT: All right. So Vax is going ahead.

1369
01:24:45,945 --> 01:24:49,476
TRAVIS: I'll allow it.

1370
01:24:49,476 --> 01:24:55,394
(laughter)

1371
01:24:55,394 --> 01:24:57,928
LIAM: (imitating Grog) Don't make a sound!

1372
01:24:57,928 --> 01:24:59,752
MATT: Vax is going forward.

1373
01:24:59,752 --> 01:25:05,034
LIAM: Oh, I'm stealthing onto a battlemap.

1374
01:25:05,034 --> 01:25:06,258
MATT: Vex, you are staying behind him?

1375
01:25:06,258 --> 01:25:07,169
LAURA: Yeah.

1376
01:25:07,169 --> 01:25:10,312
MATT: Are you going along with her? Are the two of
you going forward, or are you letting him go

1377
01:25:10,312 --> 01:25:11,466
ahead?

1378
01:25:11,466 --> 01:25:13,468
LAURA: I'm going to stay behind him.

1379
01:25:13,468 --> 01:25:17,079
MATT: Back with the group, or with him? He's
moving ahead of everyone else.

1380
01:25:17,079 --> 01:25:18,622
LAURA: How much farther ahead are you going?

1381
01:25:18,622 --> 01:25:21,268
LIAM: My proposition was to leave you all and go
look and come back. To look.

1382
01:25:21,268 --> 01:25:30,931
LAURA: That always works out. Every time. Go for
it.

1383
01:25:30,931 --> 01:25:32,070
(quietly) Go for it!

1384
01:25:32,070 --> 01:25:34,417
MATT: Make a stealth for Trinket, by the way, too,
because you forgot to do that.

1385
01:25:34,417 --> 01:25:35,225
LAURA: What?

1386
01:25:35,225 --> 01:25:36,894
MATT: Roll a stealth for Trinket, because you've
got to do that, too.

1387
01:25:36,894 --> 01:25:38,962
LAURA: Well I figure when I go too stealthy, I pop
him in my necklace, but okay.

1388
01:25:39,043 --> 01:25:42,359
MATT: Well, then Trinket is popped into your
necklace, if you wanted to go with that. Probably

1389
01:25:42,359 --> 01:25:42,964
safest.

1390
01:25:42,964 --> 01:25:44,322
LAURA: Yeah, for stealthy times.

1391
01:25:44,322 --> 01:25:47,475
MATT: So marching order is Vex. Who's behind Vex?

1392
01:25:47,536 --> 01:25:50,337
SAM: I'm in the back-back.

1393
01:25:50,337 --> 01:25:52,373
MATT: Okay. Scanlan's holding up the rear.

1394
01:25:52,437 --> 01:25:59,198
TALIESIN: Then I suppose it would be Grog, me, and
Keyleth, maybe?

1395
01:25:59,198 --> 01:26:00,340
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1396
01:26:00,340 --> 01:26:02,509
MATT: Grog behind Vex?

1397
01:26:02,509 --> 01:26:03,488
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1398
01:26:03,488 --> 01:26:09,324
MATT: And then Keyleth and Percy behind that and
then Scanlan. Vax, as you stealth up ahead, you--

1399
01:26:09,324 --> 01:26:12,118
LIAM: Can I use detect evil?

1400
01:26:12,118 --> 01:26:14,634
SAM: Detect evil? Is that a thing that exists?

1401
01:26:14,634 --> 01:26:16,407
LIAM: Yes, it is.

1402
01:26:16,407 --> 01:26:19,377
TALIESIN: You going to see anything other than me,
really?

1403
01:26:19,377 --> 01:26:22,849
TRAVIS: Don't flatter yourself.

1404
01:26:22,849 --> 01:26:25,417
TALIESIN: I'm like the city lights of Los
Angeles.

1405
01:26:25,417 --> 01:26:26,439
LIAM: You're a wannabe.

1406
01:26:26,439 --> 01:26:27,446
TALIESIN: I'm such a wannabe.

1407
01:26:27,446 --> 01:26:31,388
LAURA: What's going on? What are we doing?

1408
01:26:31,388 --> 01:26:39,918
LIAM: You're holding back. Divine Sense. The
presence of strong evil registers on your senses

1409
01:26:39,918 --> 01:26:41,463
like a noxious odor.

1410
01:26:41,463 --> 01:26:42,346
TRAVIS: Sorry.

1411
01:26:42,346 --> 01:26:43,390
MATT: The spell? The level-one spell?

1412
01:26:43,390 --> 01:26:47,295
LIAM: No, divine sense. Use this feature a number
of times equal to one plus your charisma

1413
01:26:47,295 --> 01:26:48,252
modifier.

1414
01:26:48,252 --> 01:26:53,099
MATT: Right, the paladin ability.

1415
01:26:53,099 --> 01:26:55,620
LIAM: That's right. Three times I can do it in a
day. Fancy me.

1416
01:26:55,620 --> 01:27:07,619
MATT: All righty. You stop and concentrate at the
end of your turn. All right. You do not sense any

1417
01:27:07,619 --> 01:27:09,240
celestials, fiends, or undead.

1418
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:18,947
LIAM: Oh. Okay. Good thing that I'm being quiet,
so I'm going to still creep toward the whispers.

1419
01:27:18,947 --> 01:27:27,877
MATT: You scoot ahead, and there is a small break.
You see that groove reappear in the center of this

1420
01:27:27,877 --> 01:27:32,091
break, and you see three figures on the other side
of this, seemingly in a conversation.

1421
01:27:32,091 --> 01:27:34,060
LIAM: What do they look like?

1422
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:41,195
MATT: You see, to the back, holding a large wooden
crate, and is currently leaning against it and

1423
01:27:41,195 --> 01:27:49,528
impatiently looking at the other two figures, a
female goliath with a heavy scratched scar across

1424
01:27:49,528 --> 01:27:59,565
her face, head shaved bald. She has a shield slung
over her back and a big sword currently sheathed

1425
01:27:59,565 --> 01:28:04,770
over her shoulder. She looks wounded a little bit.
There's a little bit of blood trickling down the

1426
01:28:04,770 --> 01:28:12,159
face. And then right in front of the crate, you
see a younger man with a dark hood up and cloak,

1427
01:28:12,159 --> 01:28:18,245
arguing with another woman wearing a very
intricate cloak with a sparkling blue interior.

1428
01:28:18,245 --> 01:28:23,272
Darker brown hair pulled into a very tight bun in
the back with streaks of white in the back, and

1429
01:28:23,272 --> 01:28:32,002
familiar-looking weapons dangling from her belt.
You're too far away to hear anything, but you do

1430
01:28:32,002 --> 01:28:33,061
see them.

1431
01:28:33,061 --> 01:28:37,117
LIAM: So goliath, Ripley, and the third. What does
the third look like?

1432
01:28:37,117 --> 01:28:39,393
MATT: It's too hard to see from this distance.
Looks humanoid.

1433
01:28:39,393 --> 01:28:43,258
LIAM: I go back.

1434
01:28:43,258 --> 01:28:44,408
MATT: Okay.

1435
01:28:44,408 --> 01:28:51,342
LIAM: And I go directly towards Percival.
(quietly) She is there.

1436
01:28:51,342 --> 01:28:52,226
SAM: What?

1437
01:28:52,226 --> 01:28:53,261
TALIESIN: (shushes)

1438
01:28:53,261 --> 01:28:54,256
LIAM: (whispering) Shut the fuck up!

1439
01:28:54,256 --> 01:28:55,646
SAM: (whispering) Okay.

1440
01:28:55,646 --> 01:29:07,527
LIAM: (quietly) She is there. Grog, there's a big
woman of your breed there, and a third. I don't

1441
01:29:07,527 --> 01:29:12,153
know what. I don't know if it's a he or a she. I
don't know who it is.

1442
01:29:12,153 --> 01:29:13,508
SAM: Thank god!

1443
01:29:13,508 --> 01:29:16,484
LAURA: (quietly) What do we do? Charge in, guns
blazing?

1444
01:29:16,484 --> 01:29:20,870
TALIESIN: (whispering) I say we put her down--

1445
01:29:20,870 --> 01:29:21,830
SAM: What?

1446
01:29:21,830 --> 01:29:23,695
TALIESIN: (quietly) I say we put her down as
quickly-- that's right, we have to stage whisper.

1447
01:29:23,695 --> 01:29:29,029
This is fine. Let's all assume that everyone
cannot hear us.

1448
01:29:29,029 --> 01:29:30,681
TRAVIS: (quietly) Do we know what the Vestige that
she has does?

1449
01:29:30,681 --> 01:29:31,813
TALIESIN: (quietly) We don't.

1450
01:29:31,813 --> 01:29:34,070
TRAVIS: (quietly) So what can we immobilize her
with?

1451
01:29:34,070 --> 01:29:40,028
MARISHA: We do know, for whatever she has, blocked
my scrying. So whatever it is blocked my magic.

1452
01:29:40,028 --> 01:29:41,845
TALIESIN: She's probably immune to magic.

1453
01:29:41,845 --> 01:29:45,139
LIAM: From my vantage point that I had, how far
away was I from them?

1454
01:29:45,139 --> 01:29:51,250
MATT: You were about 100 feet from them. You were
on the outside of that slight open clearing, and

1455
01:29:51,250 --> 01:29:54,890
they were in the center of it. It looked like
there was momentum moving through, and they have

1456
01:29:54,890 --> 01:29:58,681
stopped to have this argument, so you don't know
how long until they're going to keep moving

1457
01:29:58,681 --> 01:29:59,640
again.

1458
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:01,042
TRAVIS: (quietly) How about we take a short rest?

1459
01:30:01,042 --> 01:30:06,591
LIAM: We can overtake her now if we go right now.

1460
01:30:06,591 --> 01:30:09,176
TRAVIS: What about the hamster ball?

1461
01:30:09,176 --> 01:30:10,446
LAURA: But we're not rested!

1462
01:30:10,446 --> 01:30:11,958
TALIESIN: We're going to have to take it right
now!

1463
01:30:11,958 --> 01:30:15,169
SAM: I can go in there on the hamster ball, but
that doesn't do any--

1464
01:30:15,169 --> 01:30:16,910
TALIESIN: She might not be catchable.

1465
01:30:16,910 --> 01:30:18,677
SAM: I thought she can't be magicked.

1466
01:30:18,677 --> 01:30:22,674
TALIESIN: (whispering) She probably can't. Magic
one of the others. I'm going to--

1467
01:30:22,674 --> 01:30:25,215
TRAVIS: I can barely hear you.

1468
01:30:25,215 --> 01:30:31,122
TALIESIN: I'm going to create a distraction. When
the distraction happens, we all charge and attack.

1469
01:30:31,122 --> 01:30:32,538
I'll shoot her.

1470
01:30:32,538 --> 01:30:35,857
LAURA: You're creating a distraction? Why doesn't
Scanlan create the distraction?

1471
01:30:35,857 --> 01:30:37,255
TALIESIN: I have a very good distraction.

1472
01:30:37,255 --> 01:30:39,575
SAM: But we need you on sharpshooter duty.

1473
01:30:39,575 --> 01:30:44,669
MARISHA: Percy, I think you <i>are</i> the distraction.
Are you going to be the distraction?

1474
01:30:44,669 --> 01:30:47,543
TALIESIN: No. She'll know I'm here when she feels
a bullet hit her.

1475
01:30:47,543 --> 01:30:49,165
LIAM: Do we want to use these?

1476
01:30:49,165 --> 01:30:53,816
TALIESIN: I was going to make the treasure chest
look like a trap triggered. I was going to have it

1477
01:30:53,816 --> 01:30:56,725
explode with an illusionary poison.

1478
01:30:56,725 --> 01:31:02,650
MARISHA: Well, hang on. If we have the flares that
she recognized with her crew, why not use the

1479
01:31:02,650 --> 01:31:07,004
flare that her crew has? It won't alarm her to an
outsider.

1480
01:31:07,004 --> 01:31:12,534
SAM: As a seasoned magic expert, you're going to
have to be pretty fucking close to do that, friend.

1481
01:31:12,534 --> 01:31:13,782
TALIESIN: That's fair.

1482
01:31:13,782 --> 01:31:17,063
TRAVIS: I think she doesn't care about her crew,
remember? She's already this far inland--

1483
01:31:17,063 --> 01:31:20,698
LAURA: I think Scanlan fucking distract and we all
charge in like motherfuckers!

1484
01:31:20,698 --> 01:31:25,733
TALIESIN: Magic users, try and chase the others
off. See if they'll back off. We've got to get

1485
01:31:25,733 --> 01:31:27,273
that box away from them.

1486
01:31:27,273 --> 01:31:32,582
MARISHA: She already got away from us once by
using magical abilities to blink out of existence.

1487
01:31:32,582 --> 01:31:36,680
We have to make sure we lock her down so she
doesn't run. Scanlan, can you do that?

1488
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:38,058
SAM: I'll try.

1489
01:31:38,058 --> 01:31:40,751
LIAM: There's a big woman in there. She's all
yours.

1490
01:31:40,751 --> 01:31:43,447
LAURA: I guess I pop Trinket out.

1491
01:31:43,447 --> 01:31:44,751
MATT: Okay.

1492
01:31:44,751 --> 01:31:52,300
LAURA: And I get up on the bow. I mean, on the
broom. I sit on my bow, then I realize that I'm--

1493
01:31:52,300 --> 01:31:56,442
TRAVIS: Wait, Vax. From a one to a ten, would you
say she's a...

1494
01:31:56,442 --> 01:31:59,724
LIAM: Eight point eight?

1495
01:31:59,724 --> 01:32:01,026
TRAVIS: Sweet.

1496
01:32:01,026 --> 01:32:03,910
SAM: Percy, I need you to do something right now.

1497
01:32:03,910 --> 01:32:04,787
TALIESIN: Yes?

1498
01:32:04,787 --> 01:32:08,454
SAM: Make me a minor illusion of Ripley.

1499
01:32:08,454 --> 01:32:11,362
TALIESIN: I can't move it.

1500
01:32:11,362 --> 01:32:12,756
SAM: Just a picture.

1501
01:32:12,756 --> 01:32:16,484
MATT: Minor Illusion is very limited as a
cantrip.

1502
01:32:16,484 --> 01:32:17,558
SAM: Just a picture.

1503
01:32:17,558 --> 01:32:18,505
TALIESIN: Just a little--

1504
01:32:18,505 --> 01:32:19,976
TRAVIS: Like a headshot?

1505
01:32:19,976 --> 01:32:21,021
SAM: A headshot.

1506
01:32:21,021 --> 01:32:22,872
LIAM: Like a 1980s Halloween mask?

1507
01:32:22,872 --> 01:32:28,804
MATT: It lasts for a minute, and it stays in that
place.

1508
01:32:28,804 --> 01:32:30,652
SAM: That's all I want.

1509
01:32:30,652 --> 01:32:32,436
MATT: Where do you want to create it?

1510
01:32:32,436 --> 01:32:38,340
SAM: Create it right here. Good dog. I call the
dog. I say, look at this face. Go grapple that

1511
01:32:38,340 --> 01:32:39,975
face. Go! Go now!

1512
01:32:39,975 --> 01:32:46,865
TALIESIN: I'm going to make my way to the tree
line and get ready. I'm going to make my way to a

1513
01:32:46,865 --> 01:32:50,503
tree line sitting down. I'm going to try and get a
nice clear shot the minute that I see anything

1514
01:32:50,503 --> 01:32:51,428
happen.

1515
01:32:51,428 --> 01:32:52,398
MATT: So you're releasing the dog?

1516
01:32:52,398 --> 01:32:53,597
SAM: I'm releasing the dog.

1517
01:32:53,597 --> 01:32:57,280
LAURA: I'm going to fly up to the top of a tree
and try to be high up.

1518
01:32:57,280 --> 01:33:01,785
MATT: You fly up into the tree there, you guys all
making your way towards the edge of this clearing,

1519
01:33:01,785 --> 01:33:06,863
the dog goes, "I'm terribly sorry. What were you
requesting?"

1520
01:33:06,863 --> 01:33:08,501
LAURA: Oh my god, that's right! He speaks!

1521
01:33:08,501 --> 01:33:09,380
SAM: Oh, hi.

1522
01:33:09,380 --> 01:33:10,247
MATT: "Hi."

1523
01:33:10,247 --> 01:33:11,380
SAM: I'm Scanlan.

1524
01:33:11,380 --> 01:33:13,925
MATT: This black mastiff quizzically turns his
head to you.

1525
01:33:13,925 --> 01:33:15,927
SAM: Yes, I forgot you can talk.

1526
01:33:15,927 --> 01:33:19,117
MATT: "Yes. What are we doing? Who are you? What
was the presence here?"

1527
01:33:19,117 --> 01:33:20,683
SAM: Oh, hi. We're your new masters.

1528
01:33:20,683 --> 01:33:22,367
MATT: "Great."

1529
01:33:22,367 --> 01:33:24,932
SAM: Do you like kibble or meat, or something?

1530
01:33:24,932 --> 01:33:27,025
MATT: "No."

1531
01:33:27,025 --> 01:33:29,531
SAM: Can I ask a favor of you?

1532
01:33:29,531 --> 01:33:31,461
MATT: "Maybe."

1533
01:33:31,461 --> 01:33:40,073
SAM: We are really in a pickle and we need you to
go grab someone by the face and hold her down. Oh

1534
01:33:40,073 --> 01:33:41,683
shit. (laughs)

1535
01:33:41,683 --> 01:33:46,621
MATT: "I'll see what I can do. When? Who?"

1536
01:33:46,621 --> 01:33:53,330
SAM: On the count of ten, maybe? This image, this
picture. If you go over that little ridge line

1537
01:33:53,330 --> 01:34:00,497
there, you're going to see three figures. One will
be she. Go put your maw on her face and grab it.

1538
01:34:00,497 --> 01:34:05,122
MATT: "All right. All right."

1539
01:34:05,122 --> 01:34:06,530
SAM: You're a good doggy! Yes, you are!

1540
01:34:06,530 --> 01:34:08,970
MATT: "Don't call me that, please. It's
demeaning."

1541
01:34:08,970 --> 01:34:10,981
SAM: Do you have a name?

1542
01:34:10,981 --> 01:34:12,875
MATT: You already have his name.

1543
01:34:12,875 --> 01:34:19,299
LAURA: I thought it was good dog. Oh, that's not
his real name? What is his name? Does it say it on

1544
01:34:19,299 --> 01:34:20,409
the card?

1545
01:34:20,409 --> 01:34:21,357
TALIESIN: It does.

1546
01:34:21,357 --> 01:34:22,327
TRAVIS: Reginald.

1547
01:34:22,327 --> 01:34:23,259
LIAM: Shazbot.

1548
01:34:23,259 --> 01:34:26,233
SAM: It does? I thought it was good doggy. Onyx
dog?

1549
01:34:26,233 --> 01:34:30,140
MATT: I'll have to go look in my notes again.
Anyway, you know its name. It's fine. We won't go

1550
01:34:30,140 --> 01:34:31,132
into too much--

1551
01:34:31,132 --> 01:34:32,265
LIAM: Mister Belvedere.

1552
01:34:32,265 --> 01:34:35,756
MATT: You guys make your way towards this
clearing, preparing for the sequence. We're going

1553
01:34:35,756 --> 01:34:42,171
to take a bathroom break and come back for the
ensuing chaos. So we'll see you guys back here in

1554
01:34:42,171 --> 01:34:48,162
a few minutes. Thank you, Loot Crate. Check out
the stuff; we have awesome stuff with them. Back

1555
01:34:48,162 --> 01:34:49,687
here in a few minutes, guys.

1556
01:34:49,687 --> 01:34:50,954
TALIESIN: Nails and screws!

1557
01:34:50,954 --> 01:35:21,828
[break]

1558
01:35:21,828 --> 01:35:31,722
MATT: Welcome back. Last we left off, Vax noticed
that apparently Ripley and some of her crew are

1559
01:35:31,722 --> 01:35:37,454
trying to make their way back further into the
jungle and are in mid-discussion. This is just for

1560
01:35:37,454 --> 01:35:42,333
spatial awareness at the moment, and depending on
what happens, possible battle. Where do you guys

1561
01:35:42,333 --> 01:35:43,847
want to be for this?

1562
01:35:43,847 --> 01:35:45,250
TRAVIS: Who's on the map right now?

1563
01:35:45,250 --> 01:35:48,845
MATT: This is the goliath right there holding the
box. I didn't have a box, really, but there's a

1564
01:35:48,845 --> 01:35:51,256
big box. That's Ripley, and that's the hooded
figure.

1565
01:35:51,256 --> 01:35:53,447
LAURA: I wanted to be hiding up in a tree.

1566
01:35:53,447 --> 01:35:54,928
MATT: All right.

1567
01:35:54,928 --> 01:35:57,490
TRAVIS: Still can't see the third, right?

1568
01:35:57,490 --> 01:35:59,336
MATT: What's up?

1569
01:35:59,336 --> 01:36:01,299
TRAVIS: We still can't make out the third figure.

1570
01:36:01,299 --> 01:36:06,782
LIAM: The third figure is by Ripley. The goliath
is off on her own with some sort of box.

1571
01:36:06,782 --> 01:36:13,353
MATT: We'll say you're up here, Vex, off to the
side at this open bit here. The rest of you guys,

1572
01:36:13,353 --> 01:36:17,207
tell me where you want to be placed. Anywhere
that's green is essentially tree overbrush.

1573
01:36:17,207 --> 01:36:19,827
TALIESIN: Where are they and the box right now?

1574
01:36:19,827 --> 01:36:24,442
MATT: That's Ripley, that's the hooded figure, a
hooded thug, and that's the goliath.

1575
01:36:24,442 --> 01:36:30,496
LIAM: I'd like to not go direct, but slowly start
creeping around through that green.

1576
01:36:30,496 --> 01:36:33,396
MATT: Over here?

1577
01:36:33,396 --> 01:36:34,508
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1578
01:36:34,508 --> 01:36:35,632
MATT: Make a stealth check, Grog.

1579
01:36:35,632 --> 01:36:36,332
TRAVIS: What?

1580
01:36:36,332 --> 01:36:37,689
MATT: Make a stealth check. You're getting close.

1581
01:36:37,689 --> 01:36:43,601
TALIESIN: I'm going to stay in the brush, but I
want to get forward enough to get a clear shot so

1582
01:36:43,601 --> 01:36:46,550
I can really take a nice, well-aimed shot at
Ripley's head.

1583
01:36:46,550 --> 01:36:48,921
MATT: That right there is going to be--

1584
01:36:48,921 --> 01:36:53,186
TALIESIN: I've got some nice distance.

1585
01:36:53,186 --> 01:36:54,458
MATT: It's up to you.

1586
01:36:54,458 --> 01:36:55,518
TRAVIS: It's a 14.

1587
01:36:55,518 --> 01:36:56,965
MATT: A 14?

1588
01:36:56,965 --> 01:36:59,054
MARISHA: I have a Hold Person spell. I can try and
hold her.

1589
01:36:59,054 --> 01:37:00,369
MATT: Keyleth, where do you want to go?

1590
01:37:00,369 --> 01:37:08,957
MARISHA: I'm going to creep forward and towards
Grog, but being very stealthy.

1591
01:37:08,957 --> 01:37:13,455
MATT: Stealth check. Scanlan, you have a little
dog with you.

1592
01:37:13,455 --> 01:37:19,894
SAM: I think we're going to start out under where
Vex is flying, like if she bird pooped on us.

1593
01:37:19,894 --> 01:37:21,469
MARISHA: 20 total.

1594
01:37:21,469 --> 01:37:31,708
MATT: 20 total? Okay. So as you guys are setting
up place, Vax, you can start hearing, and you

1595
01:37:31,708 --> 01:37:39,132
start hearing some of the conversation. You hear
Ripley loudly whispering, "Look, I've been

1596
01:37:39,132 --> 01:37:44,667
"carefully setting my scheduling on this, and we
have at least 15 to 20 minutes before they arrive."

1597
01:37:44,667 --> 01:37:52,782
The thug turns to her and says, "You also said
they wouldn't be arriving to the island for

1598
01:37:52,782 --> 01:37:56,522
"another day or so. We don't have time to drag our
prize to the transport site."

1599
01:37:56,522 --> 01:38:02,420
Anna returns immediately with a "You are a fool to
argue with your superior, child. I hired you as a

1600
01:38:02,420 --> 01:38:08,548
"bodyguard, nothing more. I plot, you protect. If
this doesn't suit you, allow me to fire you from

1601
01:38:08,548 --> 01:38:11,336
"service." She pulls one of her guns out and cocks
it and points it.

1602
01:38:11,336 --> 01:38:20,028
He goes, "No, I mean no disrespect, but we must
begin setting a trap here now if we hope to stop them."

1603
01:38:20,028 --> 01:38:22,077
LIAM: Is that a he or she that I'm hearing?

1604
01:38:22,077 --> 01:38:27,556
MATT: It's a he. Anna says, "You aren't wrong.
Luska, take the relic to the others at the

1605
01:38:27,556 --> 01:38:30,405
"mountain. We'll wait here and prepare for our
pursuers."

1606
01:38:30,405 --> 01:38:40,122
And the goliath reaches down and begins to grab
the box and goes, "You mean use the relic against them?"

1607
01:38:40,122 --> 01:38:48,413
Anna says, "It may be too dangerous given we know
little about it. Let me think." As this is

1608
01:38:48,413 --> 01:38:54,804
happening, you hear a (cracking) in a nearby brush,
and all of a sudden, they both look over in the

1609
01:38:54,804 --> 01:38:58,868
direction as a goliath holding an axe is visible
behind one of the trees.

1610
01:38:58,868 --> 01:39:01,491
(yelling)

1611
01:39:01,491 --> 01:39:02,986
LAURA: I fire. We all fire!

1612
01:39:02,986 --> 01:39:13,687
MATT: (laughs) Okay. So who's firing right now?
Okay. You, you, and you.

1613
01:39:13,687 --> 01:39:14,906
SAM: I'm releasing a dog.

1614
01:39:14,906 --> 01:39:15,946
MATT: You're releasing a dog.

1615
01:39:15,946 --> 01:39:18,161
MARISHA: I'm going to try and hold Ripley with a
Hold Person.

1616
01:39:18,161 --> 01:39:27,668
MATT: Okay. Going around here for this, you
release the dog. The dog begins to run. I'll say

1617
01:39:27,668 --> 01:39:33,237
it gets about there. Vax, you're throwing a
dagger? Roll for an attack.

1618
01:39:33,237 --> 01:39:37,120
LIAM: Is it a surprise at this point, or no? Is it
blown?

1619
01:39:37,120 --> 01:39:44,133
MATT: No, Grog broke the surprise. You still get
the advantage on the first strike, though.

1620
01:39:44,133 --> 01:39:48,362
LIAM: Okay. 24 on Ripley.

1621
01:39:48,362 --> 01:39:53,661
MATT: Okay, 24 on Ripley. That hits. Roll damage.

1622
01:39:53,661 --> 01:40:16,614
LIAM: I get sneak attack because I'm first to go.
It's not surprise. All right. Fuck. (counting) 34.

1623
01:40:16,614 --> 01:40:27,221
34 and the second dagger will go as well for
seven. Plus poison. DC of 15.

1624
01:40:27,221 --> 01:40:33,731
MATT: Okay. You throw both daggers. One goes into
her shoulder and she pulls back, the impact

1625
01:40:33,731 --> 01:40:37,889
hitting but her seemingly resisting, not taking
the full brunt of the blow. The second one hits

1626
01:40:37,889 --> 01:40:46,900
again, and it's a delayed reaction from the
impact. She's like, "Stop! Stop now!" Puts her

1627
01:40:46,900 --> 01:40:50,783
hand out like that, shouting out to you, shouting
out to the direction of where the dagger came

1628
01:40:50,783 --> 01:40:54,745
from. She sees you moving past in the brush,
glancing, and is putting her hands up like that.

1629
01:40:54,745 --> 01:40:57,420
What are the rest of you guys doing? Are you going
through?

1630
01:40:57,420 --> 01:40:58,678
LIAM: Did the poison take effect?

1631
01:40:58,678 --> 01:41:02,031
MATT: You don't know. All right. Vex?

1632
01:41:02,031 --> 01:41:03,663
LAURA: I'm going to shoot a bramble shot at her.

1633
01:41:03,663 --> 01:41:04,913
MATT: Bramble shot from up here?

1634
01:41:04,913 --> 01:41:05,837
LAURA: Yeah.

1635
01:41:05,837 --> 01:41:12,186
MATT: Okay. She has pretty intense cover from you
from that side. That high up, you can see where

1636
01:41:12,186 --> 01:41:17,687
she is, but she's pretty much almost full cover,
so she has a big bonus to AC.

1637
01:41:17,687 --> 01:41:22,167
LAURA: Then I'll try a regular shot. Since I can't
see her, I don't want to waste my bramble shot.

1638
01:41:22,167 --> 01:41:24,101
MATT: First strike?

1639
01:41:24,101 --> 01:41:30,554
LAURA: 22.

1640
01:41:30,554 --> 01:41:36,273
MATT: 22. With the cover bonus, no. Arrow misses.
It hits a tree nearby.

1641
01:41:36,273 --> 01:41:38,743
LAURA: Goddamn it. The other one misses, too.

1642
01:41:38,743 --> 01:41:46,742
MATT: (impact sound) Hits another tree. Nothing.
She's still shouting, "Stop! Let's talk!" Scanlan

1643
01:41:46,742 --> 01:41:49,171
and Percy, what are you guys doing?

1644
01:41:49,171 --> 01:41:53,520
SAM: I say to Percy, should we hear her out?

1645
01:41:53,520 --> 01:42:05,549
MATT: You see her holding her shoulder from where
the dagger impacted. The other hooded figure has

1646
01:42:05,549 --> 01:42:08,191
pulled a blade out and is looking around.

1647
01:42:08,191 --> 01:42:11,161
SAM: I'll shout at her: what do you want to say?

1648
01:42:11,161 --> 01:42:15,092
MATT: You shout? All right. Grog, what are you
doing?

1649
01:42:15,092 --> 01:42:20,001
TRAVIS: I want to ring the fucking dinner bell.

1650
01:42:20,001 --> 01:42:21,302
SAM: We will.

1651
01:42:21,302 --> 01:42:23,807
MARISHA: I can lock her down.

1652
01:42:23,807 --> 01:42:27,726
TRAVIS: I step on the branch that creaked like I'm
angry at it.

1653
01:42:27,726 --> 01:42:29,596
MATT: It snaps loudly.

1654
01:42:29,596 --> 01:42:35,746
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Hex on her with my
bonus. I'm going to hold my action. I'm going to

1655
01:42:35,746 --> 01:42:47,771
train, and I'm going to shout from the woods: step
away from the box and tell your men to put their

1656
01:42:47,771 --> 01:42:50,463
weapons down, and we will listen.

1657
01:42:50,463 --> 01:42:53,694
MATT: Okay. Keyleth, what are you doing?

1658
01:42:53,694 --> 01:43:03,628
MARISHA: I'm going to take a few steps forward,
like two boxes forward, and I'm going to release a

1659
01:43:03,628 --> 01:43:05,288
Hold Person on Ripley.

1660
01:43:05,288 --> 01:43:06,455
LAURA: No!

1661
01:43:06,455 --> 01:43:07,468
TALIESIN: It's a Hold Person.

1662
01:43:07,468 --> 01:43:08,917
LAURA: Oh, you're releasing it. You're doing it.

1663
01:43:08,917 --> 01:43:17,072
MARISHA: Casting it, yeah. I'm not letting it go.
19. She's got to make a wisdom save.

1664
01:43:17,072 --> 01:43:23,095
MATT: She begins backing away. The spell has no
effect.

1665
01:43:23,095 --> 01:43:25,120
MARISHA: Fucking fuck it.

1666
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:32,317
MATT: She's holding the gun up, her hand up now.
She put it up and begins taking a step back.

1667
01:43:32,317 --> 01:43:34,039
TALIESIN: Stop moving!

1668
01:43:34,039 --> 01:43:39,234
MATT: She stops moving. The other figure is
standing there, looking what to do. The goliath is

1669
01:43:39,234 --> 01:43:40,512
holding the crate now.

1670
01:43:40,512 --> 01:43:44,453
TALIESIN: Put the crate down or I'll shoot out
your ankle.

1671
01:43:44,453 --> 01:43:50,380
MATT: The goliath shouts out, "Here or bring it to
you?"

1672
01:43:50,380 --> 01:43:52,424
TALIESIN: Put it down right where it is.

1673
01:43:52,424 --> 01:44:02,304
MATT: Drops it to the ground and begins to back
away from the crate about there. Anna, who's

1674
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:05,020
standing there now, looking over and seeing you
where the voice is coming from--

1675
01:44:05,020 --> 01:44:07,404
TALIESIN: If I see a twitch, I fire.

1676
01:44:07,404 --> 01:44:16,497
MATT: "Faster than anticipated. Congratulations.
Well, now. We stand in a curious position. Shall

1677
01:44:16,497 --> 01:44:17,949
"we talk?"

1678
01:44:17,949 --> 01:44:21,765
TALIESIN: You can talk. You have however long I
choose to give you.

1679
01:44:21,765 --> 01:44:30,588
MATT: You see the blood pooling down her shoulder.
The other humanoid male, you can see now it's a

1680
01:44:30,588 --> 01:44:33,257
man behind there holding the blade out to the
side.

1681
01:44:33,257 --> 01:44:38,194
TALIESIN: Explain to us why we shouldn't kill you
now and let your two friends wander off into the

1682
01:44:38,194 --> 01:44:41,939
sunset, not to be touched by us if they turn and
run.

1683
01:44:41,939 --> 01:44:48,123
LAURA: While he's talking, I want to fly on a
closer tree so I can get a better shot at her.

1684
01:44:48,123 --> 01:44:49,641
MATT: You're going to have to get lower to get a
better look here.

1685
01:44:49,641 --> 01:44:52,881
LIAM: Can I hide again and circle around further?

1686
01:44:52,881 --> 01:44:59,812
MATT: You can get about there to get a better
view.

1687
01:44:59,812 --> 01:45:02,990
SAM: I will also inch back and try to heel the
dog.

1688
01:45:02,990 --> 01:45:05,423
MATT: The dog, which has moved forward--

1689
01:45:05,423 --> 01:45:07,500
SAM: Back! It's okay.

1690
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:08,977
MATT: Steps back there.

1691
01:45:08,977 --> 01:45:12,940
TRAVIS: I'll follow suit and also move slightly to
the outside and around their flank. Yeah, there

1692
01:45:12,940 --> 01:45:13,939
you go.

1693
01:45:13,939 --> 01:45:15,160
MATT: There, you mean?

1694
01:45:15,160 --> 01:45:16,288
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's great.

1695
01:45:16,288 --> 01:45:19,480
MATT: You can still see her through the brush. You
have a better view. She only has half cover now

1696
01:45:19,480 --> 01:45:24,958
from the trees. You, make another stealth check.
Well, you can make a bonus action to hide,

1697
01:45:24,958 --> 01:45:25,855
essentially.

1698
01:45:25,855 --> 01:45:27,537
LAURA: I want to hide behind one of the branches
of the tree.

1699
01:45:27,537 --> 01:45:31,203
MATT: Okay. Both of you guys, roll stealth. You
essentially both hide as your roguish talents let you.

1700
01:45:31,203 --> 01:45:35,079
TALIESIN: Vax, keep an eye out. Make sure that
there are not people in the jungle coming this way.

1701
01:45:35,079 --> 01:45:37,560
LAURA: 26.

1702
01:45:37,560 --> 01:45:38,585
MATT: 26.

1703
01:45:38,585 --> 01:45:44,304
LIAM: 25 on stealth.

1704
01:45:44,304 --> 01:45:52,256
MATT: Okay, gotcha. She says, "I have fairly
procured a few artifacts for myself, and you have

1705
01:45:52,256 --> 01:45:56,588
"done the same. Do we call it an honorable draw and
go our own ways?"

1706
01:45:56,588 --> 01:46:09,542
TALIESIN: I am in agreement that on that level,
all debts are settled and fair. However, I believe

1707
01:46:09,542 --> 01:46:12,437
we have some previous debts to still settle.

1708
01:46:12,437 --> 01:46:19,108
MATT: "I have no interest in the petty tyranny of
drakes and dragons. Every great beast that has

1709
01:46:19,108 --> 01:46:24,441
"asserted dominance through history has fallen to
the ingenuity of man. I worry not what you're after."

1710
01:46:24,441 --> 01:46:25,979
TALIESIN: You are so dull!

1711
01:46:25,979 --> 01:46:34,949
MATT: "The other races, Percy, and you know this
in your heart, they lack our dynamic ability to

1712
01:46:34,949 --> 01:46:44,489
"adapt, to build upon failure so quickly that
success becomes an inevitability. I have faith you

1713
01:46:44,489 --> 01:46:49,089
"will all succeed in your mission, so long as you
keep your precious white-haired boy in the lead."

1714
01:46:49,089 --> 01:46:53,995
TALIESIN: You two really follow her? Are you
idiots?

1715
01:46:53,995 --> 01:47:03,725
MATT: The man with the dagger out glares off at
you in the distance. Make a perception check,

1716
01:47:03,725 --> 01:47:04,863
actually.

1717
01:47:04,863 --> 01:47:05,969
LAURA: Who?

1718
01:47:05,969 --> 01:47:07,597
MATT: Everybody, right now.

1719
01:47:07,597 --> 01:47:11,803
SAM: 16.

1720
01:47:11,803 --> 01:47:13,026
TALIESIN: 12.

1721
01:47:13,026 --> 01:47:14,019
MARISHA: 19.

1722
01:47:14,019 --> 01:47:14,828
LIAM: 22.

1723
01:47:14,828 --> 01:47:15,783
LAURA: 32.

1724
01:47:15,783 --> 01:47:16,861
SAM: Jesus.

1725
01:47:16,861 --> 01:47:18,823
TRAVIS: You coming here?

1726
01:47:18,823 --> 01:47:21,745
SAM: Whispers! Whispers.

1727
01:47:21,745 --> 01:47:24,990
LAURA: Oh god, things are falling!

1728
01:47:24,990 --> 01:47:27,900
MATT: The twins in. Come here, guys.

1729
01:47:27,900 --> 01:47:29,359
LAURA: Ooh! We both get it.

1730
01:47:29,359 --> 01:47:31,986
SAM: Oh, you're taking the DM chair.

1731
01:47:31,986 --> 01:47:33,066
TALIESIN: Hey!

1732
01:47:33,066 --> 01:47:37,355
LAURA: Quiet! I can't hear anything Matt's
saying.

1733
01:47:37,355 --> 01:47:40,018
SAM: They're so cute over there.

1734
01:47:40,018 --> 01:47:41,823
LIAM: I knew it. I fucking knew it.

1735
01:47:41,823 --> 01:47:44,110
LAURA: Oh no!

1736
01:47:44,110 --> 01:47:47,692
TALIESIN: Anything we should know before we
continue?

1737
01:47:47,692 --> 01:47:55,774
MATT: Anna continues, arm up, says, "Religion is
archaic and unnecessary."

1738
01:47:55,774 --> 01:47:58,905
TALIESIN: What's she paying you? I bet I could
double it.

1739
01:47:58,905 --> 01:48:02,575
MATT: The man stands there.

1740
01:48:02,575 --> 01:48:07,638
TALIESIN: Attack her right now, and we'll discuss
terms. I'm not actually sure I could double it,

1741
01:48:07,638 --> 01:48:12,166
but I could definitely make it worth your while
right now. It would be hilarious. She's awful!

1742
01:48:12,166 --> 01:48:17,230
MATT: "Look, Percival."

1743
01:48:17,230 --> 01:48:21,704
TALIESIN: Oh, are they moving behind you? Do you
know? You can't see. They really don't like you.

1744
01:48:21,704 --> 01:48:27,023
Do they know what you did to my family? Do they
have any idea what you do to the people that you

1745
01:48:27,023 --> 01:48:28,592
stay with?

1746
01:48:28,592 --> 01:48:33,771
MATT: As you're talking, she cuts through your
voice to him and says, "Don't worry, Percy. Our

1747
01:48:33,771 --> 01:48:39,170
"toys have already made the rounds. I sold a couple
in Vasselheim and a few more in Ank'harel,

1748
01:48:39,170 --> 01:48:44,328
"partially because I needed the money, but also
because he told me it would drive you mad."

1749
01:48:44,328 --> 01:48:46,876
TALIESIN: How many have you sold?

1750
01:48:46,876 --> 01:48:55,143
MATT: "We're looking at six and the instructions
for creation to two other seemingly very curious

1751
01:48:55,143 --> 01:48:57,969
"and up-and-coming tinkerers like yourself."

1752
01:48:57,969 --> 01:49:04,065
TALIESIN: (sighs) Well, I guess I'll have to live
with that. I open fire.

1753
01:49:04,065 --> 01:49:05,868
MATT: Okay.

1754
01:49:05,868 --> 01:49:07,174
MARISHA: Oh my god.

1755
01:49:07,174 --> 01:49:12,070
MATT: Go ahead and roll. This combat has halted,
and now it's progressing again.

1756
01:49:12,070 --> 01:49:21,838
TALIESIN: I'm going to do a-- she really pissed me
off. I'm so sorry.

1757
01:49:21,838 --> 01:49:23,972
LIAM: I'd like to throw at her again, as well.

1758
01:49:23,972 --> 01:49:25,585
TRAVIS: What are you apologizing for?

1759
01:49:25,585 --> 01:49:32,740
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to spend a deadeye shot
on this, which is a Bad News shot with a deadeye

1760
01:49:32,740 --> 01:49:38,489
with the Hex. By the way, she is at disadvantage
on strength checks. The Hex is probably not going

1761
01:49:38,489 --> 01:49:46,863
to do a damn thing. I don't even know why I
bothered. Magic fucking cloak. With Sharpshooter.

1762
01:49:46,863 --> 01:49:52,703
I am so nervous. Natural fucking 20.

1763
01:49:52,703 --> 01:49:55,095
LAURA and MARISHA: (cheering)

1764
01:49:55,095 --> 01:49:56,775
MATT: That's your attack. Roll your attack.

1765
01:49:56,775 --> 01:49:57,866
LIAM: I rolled a 37.

1766
01:49:57,866 --> 01:50:04,745
MATT: Okay. You fire, and the dagger gets thrown.
The dagger passes through her form. Your bullet

1767
01:50:04,745 --> 01:50:13,186
has no effect. You watch as Ripley smiles and
lowers her head. Both her and the figure that were

1768
01:50:13,186 --> 01:50:20,000
standing vanish from sight. There's a streak of bright
light from the distance as a small beam hits the

1769
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:25,360
center and detonates in a small fireball, which
then causes the ground to suddenly rumble and

1770
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:33,220
(explosion) erupt in an explosion of white light
and force. Everybody but Percival, for a moment,

1771
01:50:33,220 --> 01:50:40,021
you are tossed with the blast of a hundred hammers
across your body and face. Your vision is faded as

1772
01:50:40,021 --> 01:50:47,160
you hear the sound of thunder but inches from your
ear. Numbness takes over your form. I need all of

1773
01:50:47,160 --> 01:50:49,265
you to roll a dexterity saving throw.

1774
01:50:49,265 --> 01:50:51,945
LIAM: Does evasion factor into this?

1775
01:50:51,945 --> 01:50:53,220
MATT: It may.

1776
01:50:53,220 --> 01:50:57,250
TALIESIN: Did the Hex actually take, then?
Wouldn't I have noticed?

1777
01:50:57,250 --> 01:51:03,606
MATT: You threw it over there. It seemed to cause
a smoky apparition, but no effect.

1778
01:51:03,606 --> 01:51:11,080
TRAVIS: Gil, this is on your fucking dice. Natural
20 on the second one.

1779
01:51:11,080 --> 01:51:14,906
MARISHA: Did you say we have-- no, he has
advantage.

1780
01:51:14,906 --> 01:51:16,622
MATT: He has advantage on dexterity saving
throws.

1781
01:51:16,622 --> 01:51:18,051
TRAVIS: I have danger sense.

1782
01:51:18,051 --> 01:51:19,960
SAM: Does the dog need to make a dex save?

1783
01:51:19,960 --> 01:51:21,045
MATT: The dog would, yes.

1784
01:51:21,045 --> 01:51:22,712
SAM: How do I do that for the dog?

1785
01:51:22,712 --> 01:51:24,968
MATT: How many hit points does the dog have?

1786
01:51:24,968 --> 01:51:27,827
SAM: Six.

1787
01:51:27,827 --> 01:51:35,446
MATT: Even if the dog made it, the onyx dog that
reformed into a small object is now flung from a

1788
01:51:35,446 --> 01:51:43,326
large fiery explosion. Dexterity save?

1789
01:51:43,326 --> 01:51:44,427
SAM: 14.

1790
01:51:44,427 --> 01:51:45,801
TALIESIN: 17.

1791
01:51:45,801 --> 01:51:49,324
MATT: Percy, you actually-- no, actually you
should make it too, from the sheer force.

1792
01:51:49,324 --> 01:51:50,636
Everybody makes it.

1793
01:51:50,636 --> 01:51:51,698
MARISHA: 12.

1794
01:51:51,698 --> 01:51:52,685
LIAM: 28.

1795
01:51:52,685 --> 01:51:53,657
LAURA: 15.

1796
01:51:53,657 --> 01:51:54,966
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

1797
01:51:54,966 --> 01:52:00,265
MATT: Okay. So Grog, you manage to leap out of the
way as you begin to see the fireball explosion

1798
01:52:00,265 --> 01:52:05,181
that's just out of the range. It hits in the
center here, and doesn't hit anybody, but in a

1799
01:52:05,181 --> 01:52:11,616
split second, you watch as certain things in the
ground catch flames and explode from underneath.

1800
01:52:11,616 --> 01:52:19,599
The ground itself erupts, like something deep
beneath the earth bursts outward. Grog, you take

1801
01:52:19,599 --> 01:52:22,194
32 points of fire damage.

1802
01:52:22,194 --> 01:52:24,494
TRAVIS: Wow, fuck.

1803
01:52:24,494 --> 01:52:31,509
MATT: Vax, you manage to dodge out of the way
behind a tree, the tree of which is blown past

1804
01:52:31,509 --> 01:52:34,720
you, and you duck out of the way, but it takes the
brunt of the damage. You take no damage with your

1805
01:52:34,720 --> 01:52:38,071
evasion. The rest of you take 65 points of fire
damage.

1806
01:52:38,071 --> 01:52:40,225
SAM: Nice.

1807
01:52:40,225 --> 01:52:59,883
TRAVIS: Who took the full smack? Oh my god.

1808
01:52:59,883 --> 01:53:04,998
MARISHA: Wow. We walked right into that one.

1809
01:53:04,998 --> 01:53:07,161
TRAVIS: Did the goliath--

1810
01:53:07,161 --> 01:53:16,754
MATT: The goliath probably took some damage, too.
(chuckles) Trinket also takes the damage, by the

1811
01:53:16,754 --> 01:53:18,818
way. Roll a reflex save.

1812
01:53:18,818 --> 01:53:21,003
LAURA: Trinket was on the ground, wasn't he?

1813
01:53:21,003 --> 01:53:22,207
MATT: Yep.

1814
01:53:22,207 --> 01:53:32,094
LAURA: Dexterity. 21 for Trinket.

1815
01:53:32,094 --> 01:53:36,612
MATT: Grog is not blasted prone. Managed to catch
himself.

1816
01:53:36,612 --> 01:53:37,786
LAURA: 21.

1817
01:53:37,786 --> 01:53:40,943
MATT: 21. Trinket takes 32 points of fire damage.

1818
01:53:40,943 --> 01:53:44,669
LAURA: Good, because if he had taken the full
thing, he would have been unconscious.

1819
01:53:44,669 --> 01:53:52,365
MATT: As the ringing subsides from the blast, you
all were thrown dozens of feet from your current

1820
01:53:52,365 --> 01:53:57,161
placement, most of you onto your back aside from
you, Vax, and you, Grog. Actually, Trinket would

1821
01:53:57,161 --> 01:54:02,798
have caught himself as well. You now see a giant
crater in the ground with rock and rubble and

1822
01:54:02,798 --> 01:54:07,711
shards of glass tossed around you. The trees in
the center have been blasted out, and you can see

1823
01:54:07,711 --> 01:54:13,030
a number of broken trunks and roots curved up with
little bits of fire and flame burning off their

1824
01:54:13,030 --> 01:54:20,221
edge, what little bit of burnable material still
remained on some of the living trees. The smell of

1825
01:54:20,221 --> 01:54:27,855
heavy gunpowder recently burned sits in the air as
the giant cloud of smoke rises up in the center of

1826
01:54:27,855 --> 01:54:38,252
the jungle. At this point in time, the goliath has
stepped forward from the brush, as well as two

1827
01:54:38,252 --> 01:54:41,845
other figures off to the side wielding
long-barreled rifle-like weapons.

1828
01:54:41,845 --> 01:54:49,068
There are a few other figures on this side, as
well.

1829
01:54:49,068 --> 01:54:50,564
SAM: Oh my god.

1830
01:54:50,564 --> 01:54:56,052
MATT: And actually, you don't see that one. And
Ripley steps out of the bushes from the side.

1831
01:54:56,052 --> 01:54:58,094
TRAVIS: Where is she?

1832
01:54:58,094 --> 01:54:59,375
MATT: Over there.

1833
01:54:59,375 --> 01:55:00,908
LAURA: Oh, so they are there?

1834
01:55:00,908 --> 01:55:06,318
MATT: The opposite side. This is a heavy groove in
the ground. These are the only parts of the land

1835
01:55:06,318 --> 01:55:12,206
that still stand at normal ground height. The rest
of this is a giant slope that goes into a crevasse

1836
01:55:12,206 --> 01:55:13,385
and rises back up.

1837
01:55:13,385 --> 01:55:14,906
LIAM: Vegetation is gone here, right?

1838
01:55:14,906 --> 01:55:18,492
MATT: Vegetation in that area is completely gone,
and there is broken rock and glass everywhere.

1839
01:55:18,492 --> 01:55:20,757
LAURA: How deep is the crevasse?

1840
01:55:20,757 --> 01:55:23,694
MATT: It's about 20 feet deep at its deepest.

1841
01:55:23,694 --> 01:55:26,028
LIAM: And everybody sees everybody, right?

1842
01:55:26,028 --> 01:55:29,163
MATT: Everybody sees everybody right now. I need
you all to roll initiative.

1843
01:55:29,163 --> 01:55:31,599
(groaning)

1844
01:55:31,599 --> 01:55:35,456
MARISHA: All right, overweight. Don't fucking fail
me now. That's all right.

1845
01:55:35,456 --> 01:55:38,609
TRAVIS: Come on, Gil. Natural 20.

1846
01:55:38,609 --> 01:55:40,888
SAM: Wow. You like that dice.

1847
01:55:40,888 --> 01:55:43,018
MARISHA: Is that Gil's dice again?

1848
01:55:43,018 --> 01:55:45,522
TALIESIN: It's been doing fine for me.

1849
01:55:45,522 --> 01:55:47,985
SAM: It's been hit or miss.

1850
01:55:47,985 --> 01:55:49,244
MARISHA: Yeah, same here.

1851
01:55:49,244 --> 01:55:51,648
TALIESIN: Although I will admit, I rolled gold for
this roll.

1852
01:55:51,648 --> 01:55:53,367
SAM: "I rolled gold."

1853
01:55:53,367 --> 01:55:54,714
TALIESIN: Yes, I did.

1854
01:55:54,714 --> 01:56:00,798
MARISHA: All right. Bitch.

1855
01:56:00,798 --> 01:56:14,518
MATT: A number of initiative rolls on that one.
All right. Going from this, here, because this is

1856
01:56:14,518 --> 01:56:17,997
going to be a bit of a complicated battle to keep
track of for initiative, I'm going to write it

1857
01:56:17,997 --> 01:56:20,458
here. 25 to 20?

1858
01:56:20,458 --> 01:56:21,804
TALIESIN: 30.

1859
01:56:21,804 --> 01:56:23,166
MATT: 30?

1860
01:56:23,166 --> 01:56:25,459
TALIESIN: I just rolled a natural 20 on my
initiative. It is 30.

1861
01:56:25,459 --> 01:56:29,240
MATT: This would be the time to do it. All right.
What'd you get, Grog?

1862
01:56:29,240 --> 01:56:30,187
TRAVIS: 22.

1863
01:56:30,187 --> 01:56:38,519
MATT: 22. 20 to 15?

1864
01:56:38,519 --> 01:56:40,191
LAURA: 17.

1865
01:56:40,191 --> 01:56:51,397
MATT: Vex. Right. 15 to ten?

1866
01:56:51,397 --> 01:56:53,300
LIAM: 15.

1867
01:56:53,300 --> 01:56:55,721
MARISHA: Ten.

1868
01:56:55,721 --> 01:56:58,917
MATT: Ten to five?

1869
01:56:58,917 --> 01:57:00,409
SAM: Six.

1870
01:57:00,409 --> 01:57:01,629
MATT: Six.

1871
01:57:01,629 --> 01:57:04,703
SAM: See you guys in a half hour.

1872
01:57:04,703 --> 01:57:12,642
TALIESIN: Has she actually been hit by the Hex, by
the way?

1873
01:57:12,642 --> 01:57:17,584
MATT: The Hex is still around, meaning you cast
the spell, and it's a concentration spell.

1874
01:57:17,584 --> 01:57:19,907
Actually, I need you to roll a concentration check
on it.

1875
01:57:19,907 --> 01:57:23,499
TALIESIN: That's fine. What do I roll for
concentration, again?

1876
01:57:23,499 --> 01:57:26,521
MATT: Oh, you've got to roll a natural 20. That
was a lot of damage, buddy.

1877
01:57:26,521 --> 01:57:32,838
MARISHA: Yeah, you have to roll above your damage.
Oh my god! Shut the fuck up!

1878
01:57:32,838 --> 01:57:35,128
SAM: A different dice, too.

1879
01:57:35,128 --> 01:57:43,108
MATT: Jesus Christ, Taliesin. Somehow, in the
blast, as your eyes flicker to and you immediately

1880
01:57:43,108 --> 01:57:48,138
shoot up from the ground in a sitting position
your eyes immediately focus on Ripley appearing

1881
01:57:48,138 --> 01:57:54,359
from across the way, from across the crevasse, and
that little lingering scar of Orthax in the back

1882
01:57:54,359 --> 01:58:00,643
of your head maintains the anger of your Hex. You
would have to designate it onto her next turn, but

1883
01:58:00,643 --> 01:58:02,144
you still maintain the spell.

1884
01:58:02,144 --> 01:58:04,719
TALIESIN: My hate lives.

1885
01:58:04,719 --> 01:58:07,219
MARISHA: You've got this.

1886
01:58:07,219 --> 01:58:12,210
LIAM: Fate, hate, whichever. Six of one, half a
dozen of the other.

1887
01:58:12,210 --> 01:58:13,881
TALIESIN: Oh man, that felt good.

1888
01:58:13,881 --> 01:58:18,411
MATT: Top of the round is Percy.

1889
01:58:18,411 --> 01:58:22,471
TALIESIN: Okay. Where was I?

1890
01:58:22,471 --> 01:58:25,608
MATT: You are over here on your ass right now.

1891
01:58:25,608 --> 01:58:27,626
TALIESIN: I'm going to stand up.

1892
01:58:27,626 --> 01:58:36,425
MATT: That's half your movement there. You're
right at the edge of where the ground breaks and

1893
01:58:36,425 --> 01:58:37,280
falls in.

1894
01:58:37,280 --> 01:58:41,883
TALIESIN: That's fine. What's the distance? Is it
only Bad News distance, or am I within 400?

1895
01:58:41,883 --> 01:58:44,120
MATT: You're within 400, yeah.

1896
01:58:44,120 --> 01:58:49,323
TALIESIN: So I can actually put Bad News away and
actually deal with this?

1897
01:58:49,412 --> 01:58:50,787
MATT: Yeah, if you'd like to.

1898
01:58:50,787 --> 01:58:56,510
TALIESIN: They probably all have much higher--
they're going to have initiative up the wazoo, so

1899
01:58:56,510 --> 01:59:05,635
I'm going to-- okay, no. I'm going to pull the big
gun out again, give it a reload and give it a shot

1900
01:59:05,635 --> 01:59:09,940
right at Ripley. I've got the Hex on her.

1901
01:59:09,940 --> 01:59:15,166
MATT: So you move the Hex over to her with your
bonus action. She's now officially hexed.

1902
01:59:15,166 --> 01:59:27,525
TALIESIN: Let's pick a fun disadvantage. Let's
see. Let's give her a dexterity disadvantage.

1903
01:59:27,525 --> 01:59:29,439
MATT: Dex disadvantage. Got it.

1904
01:59:29,439 --> 01:59:38,039
TALIESIN: All right. First thing I'm going to do
is I'm going to do a standard shot at her with a

1905
01:59:38,039 --> 01:59:42,250
leg shot. I'm going to try and knock her prone.

1906
01:59:42,250 --> 01:59:44,180
MATT: Okay. Go for it.

1907
01:59:44,180 --> 01:59:51,481
TALIESIN: No Sharpshooter. That's 26 to hit.

1908
01:59:51,481 --> 01:59:58,158
MATT: That'll hit. She has to make a strength
save, is it?

1909
01:59:58,158 --> 02:00:01,040
TALIESIN: She has to make a strength saving
throw.

1910
02:00:01,040 --> 02:00:03,114
MATT: That is a 19.

1911
02:00:03,114 --> 02:00:04,831
TALIESIN: Against a DC of 19.

1912
02:00:04,831 --> 02:00:10,013
MATT: She makes it. It doesn't knock her prone. It
hits her in the foot. She almost falls over. Roll

1913
02:00:10,013 --> 02:00:11,280
damage.

1914
02:00:11,280 --> 02:00:29,214
TALIESIN: Make sure I'm rolling all the right
dice. That'll do. That's six plus ten. 22 points

1915
02:00:29,214 --> 02:00:31,347
of damage plus three points of necrotic damage.

1916
02:00:31,347 --> 02:00:38,186
MATT: Nice. (gunshot) The blast hits the leg. It
almost knocks her onto the ground, but she catches

1917
02:00:38,186 --> 02:00:42,646
herself against the tree right behind her and
pushes herself into place.

1918
02:00:42,646 --> 02:00:48,052
TALIESIN: That's funny. I'm going to burn an action
surge and I'm going to shoot her two more times

1919
02:00:48,052 --> 02:00:54,663
because it's funny. Where is she? What's behind
her?

1920
02:00:54,663 --> 02:00:58,102
MATT: It is a tree about ten feet behind her.

1921
02:00:58,102 --> 02:01:02,725
TALIESIN: I'm going to hit her again with an
attempt to knock her down; I'm going to burn

1922
02:01:02,725 --> 02:01:14,442
another grit for that. That is 32 to hit.

1923
02:01:14,442 --> 02:01:17,108
MATT: 32 to hit? That'll hit.

1924
02:01:17,108 --> 02:01:31,670
TALIESIN: Not quite as good. 14 points of damage,
plus three points of necrotic. Another strength check.

1925
02:01:31,670 --> 02:01:35,960
MATT: Another strength check. This one she does
not make. As she readies herself, you fire a

1926
02:01:35,960 --> 02:01:40,993
second time, and it hits her foot. You can see a
spatter of blood off the side. She falls and slams

1927
02:01:40,993 --> 02:01:47,004
down on the ground taking three points of piercing
damage landing onto the broken glass and the

1928
02:01:47,004 --> 02:01:48,563
rubble around her.

1929
02:01:48,563 --> 02:01:57,803
TALIESIN: Just for fun-- no, then that's just her
bonus action for that, although that would be

1930
02:01:57,803 --> 02:02:09,515
pretty funny. I'm going to hit her one more time
with a Sharpshooter shot. Do I get a bonus to hit

1931
02:02:09,515 --> 02:02:11,374
her because she's on the ground, or no?

1932
02:02:11,374 --> 02:02:15,939
MATT: Actually, because she's on the ground it's
at disadvantage. Any ranged attacks against prone

1933
02:02:15,939 --> 02:02:17,433
people.

1934
02:02:17,433 --> 02:02:21,619
TALIESIN: Even with Sharpshooter? Even with
standard Sharpshooter bonus of ignore

1935
02:02:21,619 --> 02:02:23,545
three-quarter cover?

1936
02:02:23,545 --> 02:02:28,602
MATT: It's not so much cover, it's more the fact
that they're a smaller target to hit because

1937
02:02:28,602 --> 02:02:30,404
they're closer to the ground.

1938
02:02:30,404 --> 02:02:35,320
TALIESIN: So the full range Sharpshooter ignore
three-quarter cover would not cancel that out?

1939
02:02:35,320 --> 02:02:36,961
MATT: It's not cover that gives her the bonus.

1940
02:02:36,961 --> 02:02:39,326
TALIESIN: The whole theory being that it's easier
to hit smaller targets.

1941
02:02:39,326 --> 02:02:43,650
MATT: Right, it affects cover, it doesn't affect
her being a smaller target in general to hit. It's

1942
02:02:43,650 --> 02:02:45,444
the way the rule works.

1943
02:02:45,444 --> 02:02:51,059
TALIESIN: That's okay. She's down. What am I going
to do? I'm not even going to pretend. I'll burn a

1944
02:02:51,059 --> 02:02:56,149
point of grit to also ignore that.

1945
02:02:56,149 --> 02:02:58,475
MATT: Okay, there you go. It's a straight attack
roll.

1946
02:02:58,475 --> 02:03:07,117
TALIESIN: That's probably not going to hit. Let's
see. 14.

1947
02:03:07,117 --> 02:03:12,010
MATT: 14 does not hit. It scoots past her and
slams into the tree behind her. You see the

1948
02:03:12,010 --> 02:03:15,306
splintering of petrified bark.

1949
02:03:15,306 --> 02:03:23,476
TALIESIN: I throw my gun behind on my shoulder,
and I'm going to head to my right to try to get

1950
02:03:23,476 --> 02:03:25,234
some cover with that tree.

1951
02:03:25,234 --> 02:03:26,788
MATT: Around Keyleth?

1952
02:03:26,788 --> 02:03:27,961
TALIESIN: Yeah, around Keyleth.

1953
02:03:27,961 --> 02:03:29,784
LAURA: Jump over her prone form.

1954
02:03:29,784 --> 02:03:31,183
MARISHA: My dead body.

1955
02:03:31,183 --> 02:03:34,157
MATT: That ends your turn, Percy?

1956
02:03:34,157 --> 02:03:35,153
TALIESIN: Yes.

1957
02:03:35,153 --> 02:03:36,385
MATT: Grog, you're up.

1958
02:03:36,385 --> 02:03:44,308
TRAVIS: I look to the crater in the ground and I
go: Whoa. And I would like to rage. Can I, in 50

1959
02:03:44,308 --> 02:03:45,551
feet, get to--

1960
02:03:45,551 --> 02:03:46,747
MATT: Regular rage or frenzied rage?

1961
02:03:46,747 --> 02:03:50,115
TRAVIS: Regular. Can I get all the way to the guy
who's right in front of me on the map along the

1962
02:03:50,115 --> 02:03:52,059
side of the crater, or is that not enough for 50?

1963
02:03:52,059 --> 02:03:53,993
MATT: You can just get there.

1964
02:03:53,993 --> 02:03:57,595
TRAVIS: I'll just get there. Lovely.

1965
02:03:57,595 --> 02:04:01,347
MATT: You see him loading a rifle, and all of a
sudden you rush up to the side and he goes, "Oh shit!"

1966
02:04:01,347 --> 02:04:07,862
TRAVIS: I would like to make a reckless attack
against him with my two blows.

1967
02:04:07,862 --> 02:04:09,237
MATT: Go for it.

1968
02:04:09,237 --> 02:04:18,526
TRAVIS: That's 29.

1969
02:04:18,526 --> 02:04:20,711
MATT: 29 will definitely hit.

1970
02:04:20,711 --> 02:04:28,046
TRAVIS: Nice. 33.

1971
02:04:28,046 --> 02:04:29,859
MATT: 33 points of damage?

1972
02:04:29,859 --> 02:04:33,304
TRAVIS: No, I'm sorry. 33 to hit for the second
one.

1973
02:04:33,304 --> 02:04:37,003
MATT: Oh, I see. They both hit. Go ahead and roll
damage.

1974
02:04:37,003 --> 02:04:46,078
TRAVIS: 29, with five points of necrotic damage.

1975
02:04:46,078 --> 02:04:50,789
MATT: Nice, so 34, you actually did more! Second
strike?

1976
02:04:50,789 --> 02:04:53,954
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, 29 includes the five points of
necrotic damage. I'm so sorry.

1977
02:04:53,954 --> 02:04:55,294
MATT: It's all right. 29.

1978
02:04:55,294 --> 02:05:02,355
TRAVIS: Second one. Total of 22, with another five
points of necrotic.

1979
02:05:02,355 --> 02:05:10,588
MATT: As you rush up and hack into him with the
blade, angry, your jaw clenched in anger, the

1980
02:05:10,588 --> 02:05:15,877
gunner is pushed back, each blow gashing into his
chest You can already see the crimson line of each

1981
02:05:15,877 --> 02:05:20,859
slash across his armor, folding away from the
impact. He's trying to get the hell away from you.

1982
02:05:20,859 --> 02:05:22,594
Does that end your turn?

1983
02:05:22,594 --> 02:05:25,406
TRAVIS: I say: Thanks for the warm-up. And that's
my turn.

1984
02:05:25,406 --> 02:05:41,092
MATT: Next up is Anna Ripley. She stands up from
her space angrily and goes, "That's all right. We

1985
02:05:41,092 --> 02:05:49,879
"can finish the job." She brings her hand up and
begins casting a spell on herself. She finishes

1986
02:05:49,879 --> 02:05:57,702
casting the spell. A weird outline begins a
gold-like shimmer across the edges of her

1987
02:05:57,702 --> 02:06:07,057
shoulders. You're not quite sure what it means.
You watch as her right metallic hand detaches and

1988
02:06:07,057 --> 02:06:12,952
hits the ground. You watch as a flare of
purplish-black energy begins to swirl off her

1989
02:06:12,952 --> 02:06:21,108
shoulders and where the arm was, now you see a
giant shadow claw emerge. You see a shadow begin

1990
02:06:21,108 --> 02:06:27,075
to encompass around her, another pair of shoulders
and glowing yellow eyes over her form as she says,

1991
02:06:27,075 --> 02:06:33,732
"I found a new friend recently. Seems he doesn't
like being abandoned."

1992
02:06:33,732 --> 02:06:40,204
SAM: She's the anti-Percy.

1993
02:06:40,204 --> 02:06:42,438
TRAVIS: That's where we'll pick it up next week.

1994
02:06:42,438 --> 02:06:47,284
TALIESIN: Thank you for watching Critical Role.
Brought to you by poor decisions.

1995
02:06:47,284 --> 02:06:52,886
MATT: With that, she vanishes.

1996
02:06:52,886 --> 02:06:55,783
LIAM: Chickens are all coming home to roost.

1997
02:06:55,783 --> 02:06:59,591
LAURA: Can I say how much I wish Pike was here
right now?

1998
02:06:59,591 --> 02:07:00,926
LIAM: Yeah, seconded.

1999
02:07:00,926 --> 02:07:02,279
MARISHA: I third that.

2000
02:07:02,279 --> 02:07:03,504
TRAVIS: Yeah, we miss Pike!

2001
02:07:03,504 --> 02:07:12,369
MATT: This gunner here is going to aim at you,
Vax, while this one is going to attempt to step

2002
02:07:12,369 --> 02:07:17,378
away from Grog. Go ahead and make your attack of
opportunity on him.

2003
02:07:17,378 --> 02:07:24,251
TRAVIS: This is reckless. 29.

2004
02:07:24,251 --> 02:07:25,760
MATT: That hits.

2005
02:07:25,760 --> 02:07:35,588
TRAVIS: 20 points, including three points of
necrotic. 20 total.

2006
02:07:35,588 --> 02:07:39,904
MATT: Nice. As he runs away, you hack again, this
time across the back of the shoulders. He arcs in

2007
02:07:39,904 --> 02:07:46,660
pain. He's looking a little rough, but still
keeping up. He stumbles away, turns around, whips

2008
02:07:46,660 --> 02:07:51,470
the rifle behind and goes to fire at you with it.
It has advantage on you because you reckless

2009
02:07:51,470 --> 02:08:00,221
attacked. That's a natural 20 on the second roll.
With the rifle, it's 2d10.

2010
02:08:00,221 --> 02:08:10,166
TALIESIN: I should mention, I suppose, that these
rifles are probably very breakable.

2011
02:08:10,166 --> 02:08:17,058
MATT: 42 points of piercing damage to you, Grog,
from the crit. Because you are raging and it's not

2012
02:08:17,058 --> 02:08:19,717
magical, that's halved, so you take 21 points of
damage.

2013
02:08:19,717 --> 02:08:21,888
LIAM: That's eight percent of your hit point
pool.

2014
02:08:21,888 --> 02:08:26,453
MARISHA: If we can all get together, I actually
brought Heal today because Pike wasn't here.

2015
02:08:26,453 --> 02:08:35,510
MATT: Going to reload the rifle and then go for
another strike. With advantage, that's 17 plus

2016
02:08:35,510 --> 02:08:37,448
ten, so 27.

2017
02:08:37,448 --> 02:08:39,010
TRAVIS: Yep, that'll hit.

2018
02:08:39,010 --> 02:08:49,487
MATT: Next hit is 13 points of piercing damage,
reduced to six. The other gunner, aiming at you, Vax.

2019
02:08:49,487 --> 02:08:51,336
LIAM: Disadvantage because of the cloak.

2020
02:08:51,336 --> 02:08:56,996
MATT: Yes, and it rolled a one and a 19. The first
shot goes clear. It hits your form, but your form

2021
02:08:56,996 --> 02:08:58,131
shimmers--

2022
02:08:58,131 --> 02:09:00,643
TALIESIN: Wouldn't a roll of a one with a rifle
misfire?

2023
02:09:00,643 --> 02:09:08,593
MATT: Yeah, it's going to. The rifle immediately
(gunfire) smoke starts pouring out it. You see

2024
02:09:08,593 --> 02:09:15,998
the metal is bent now and he chucks it to the
side, turns, and pulls out a small pistol and is

2025
02:09:15,998 --> 02:09:23,583
going to take two shots at you with disadvantage.
That's five plus ten, 15 misses. Second shot

2026
02:09:23,583 --> 02:09:31,834
misses. Turns the barrel, goes to fire a third
time with disadvantage. Six and a 19, nope. The

2027
02:09:31,834 --> 02:09:37,405
third one fires, and each one's hitting your form,
but your image shifts around it. No impact. It's

2028
02:09:37,405 --> 02:09:41,771
going to step back into the bush here, try to get
out of sight. That guy's going to stay over there.

2029
02:09:41,771 --> 02:09:43,958
That ends their turn. Vex, you're up.

2030
02:09:43,958 --> 02:09:45,765
LAURA: Where am I?

2031
02:09:45,765 --> 02:09:52,335
MATT: You're over here, flat on your ass, looking
up at the open space where a bunch of tree cover

2032
02:09:52,335 --> 02:09:55,254
used to be that is now blown open, the sky is
visible.

2033
02:09:55,254 --> 02:10:05,004
LAURA: Well, I stand up. What are those circles
next to Trinket? What are those?

2034
02:10:05,004 --> 02:10:09,074
MATT: These are some trees that survived the
explosion that are singed and burned. This is a

2035
02:10:09,074 --> 02:10:13,034
trunk approximately this big underneath.

2036
02:10:13,034 --> 02:10:15,714
LAURA: Would I be able to hide behind that?

2037
02:10:15,714 --> 02:10:20,834
MATT: Using half your movement to get up, you
would have 15 more feet, so this is as far as you

2038
02:10:20,834 --> 02:10:27,699
could get. But you could use your bonus action to
dash if you wanted to, because you're second-level rogue.

2039
02:10:27,699 --> 02:10:31,555
LAURA: Okay, I'll do that and dash and hide behind
the tree.

2040
02:10:31,555 --> 02:10:36,807
MATT: You dash, but you can't roll a hide, as
well, unless you want to use your action to do that.

2041
02:10:36,807 --> 02:10:47,533
LAURA: Well, I want to get behind the tree so it's
still coverage. Right? Then can I shoot from there?

2042
02:10:47,533 --> 02:10:49,934
MATT: You can, yeah, so long as something's in
range.

2043
02:10:49,934 --> 02:10:51,982
LAURA: Is anything in range?

2044
02:10:51,982 --> 02:10:58,572
MATT: What's the range on your longbow? It should
be written down.

2045
02:10:58,572 --> 02:11:01,727
LAURA: I don't know; it doesn't say.

2046
02:11:01,727 --> 02:11:12,395
MATT: You should have written it down. Longbow is
150 feet and 600 feet. Yes. Pretty much everything

2047
02:11:12,395 --> 02:11:16,700
except for maybe the farthest guy is questionably
within your first range category. Yeah, you do

2048
02:11:16,700 --> 02:11:18,389
have a shot at most everything.

2049
02:11:18,389 --> 02:11:24,043
LAURA: The guy that Grog hit is outside of my
range?

2050
02:11:24,043 --> 02:11:27,462
MATT: He might be; it's hard to tell at this
distance. You'd have to gauge it.

2051
02:11:27,462 --> 02:11:31,619
LAURA: I'm going to shoot at the guy closest to
me. I want to be able to peek out, shoot, and then

2052
02:11:31,619 --> 02:11:32,899
duck back behind the tree.

2053
02:11:32,899 --> 02:11:34,007
MATT: Go for it.

2054
02:11:34,007 --> 02:11:35,208
LAURA: What?

2055
02:11:35,208 --> 02:11:37,428
LIAM: Nothing. You didn't hear me.

2056
02:11:37,428 --> 02:11:39,038
TRAVIS: Go for it.

2057
02:11:39,038 --> 02:11:48,764
LAURA: Okay. I don't know what you want! That is a
30-something. 32.

2058
02:11:48,764 --> 02:11:50,168
MATT: That hits!

2059
02:11:50,168 --> 02:11:51,547
TRAVIS: Jesus, Fenthras.

2060
02:11:51,547 --> 02:12:01,338
LAURA: What? 21.

2061
02:12:01,338 --> 02:12:03,661
MATT: 21 points of damage.

2062
02:12:03,661 --> 02:12:06,180
LAURA: What the fuck, man?

2063
02:12:06,180 --> 02:12:09,774
MATT: As the figure's disappearing backwards
trying to get into the brush to hide, the arrow

2064
02:12:09,774 --> 02:12:16,600
hits the female warrior, and you can see her move.
You can take your second attack on her.

2065
02:12:16,600 --> 02:12:18,648
LAURA: That was the female warrior?

2066
02:12:18,648 --> 02:12:20,472
MATT: That was the female gunner, yeah.

2067
02:12:20,472 --> 02:12:21,702
LIAM: Which one?

2068
02:12:21,702 --> 02:12:22,812
MATT: Right there.

2069
02:12:22,812 --> 02:12:24,395
LAURA: I'm not shooting at the other one, dude!

2070
02:12:24,395 --> 02:12:25,585
LIAM: I thought that's what he said.

2071
02:12:25,585 --> 02:12:30,606
LAURA: No! I'm going to shoot her again. 18
doesn't hit her.

2072
02:12:30,606 --> 02:12:33,338
MATT: 18 just barely hits.

2073
02:12:33,338 --> 02:12:37,640
TRAVIS: Fenthras! Yes!

2074
02:12:37,640 --> 02:12:40,736
MATT: Didn't quite get into cover.

2075
02:12:40,736 --> 02:12:49,006
LAURA: 22 on that one. Oh, and the last two had
four points of lightning damage on both of them.

2076
02:12:49,006 --> 02:12:53,614
MATT: You hear the echo of angry, gritted teeth
from the pain of two arrow blows.

2077
02:12:53,614 --> 02:12:55,792
LAURA: I duck back behind the tree.

2078
02:12:55,792 --> 02:12:59,749
MATT: You're using the tree. You're at half cover
at the tree. Vax, you're up.

2079
02:12:59,749 --> 02:13:05,608
LIAM: The one in the far corner is not the one
that you whispered about. Who shot at me?

2080
02:13:05,608 --> 02:13:10,219
MATT: The one that I whispered to? Was an
illusion. It vanished. You don't see that figure

2081
02:13:10,219 --> 02:13:11,524
anymore.

2082
02:13:11,524 --> 02:13:21,998
LIAM: Fucking hell. All right. Oh shit. The one in
the far corner is the one my sister attacked?

2083
02:13:21,998 --> 02:13:23,915
MATT: Yeah, right there. You saw the two arrows.

2084
02:13:23,915 --> 02:13:25,661
LIAM: Then I'm going to follow up.

2085
02:13:25,661 --> 02:13:27,801
TALIESIN: One more player off the board.

2086
02:13:27,801 --> 02:13:31,281
MATT: Are you going to move closer, or are you
leaping up onto the--

2087
02:13:31,281 --> 02:13:33,398
LIAM: Yeah, I'm Sharpshooter.

2088
02:13:33,398 --> 02:13:36,803
MATT: This tree's too thick; you're going to have
to get up onto the tree to do it. You leap up and

2089
02:13:36,803 --> 02:13:38,335
get onto it.

2090
02:13:38,335 --> 02:13:42,804
LIAM: 29 for the first. The second is 26.

2091
02:13:42,804 --> 02:13:48,289
MATT: Both hit. Unfortunately, no sneak attack.

2092
02:13:48,289 --> 02:13:53,351
LIAM: Yeah, I know. That is eight for the first.

2093
02:13:53,351 --> 02:13:55,385
MATT: You're up next, Keyleth, by the way.

2094
02:13:55,385 --> 02:13:56,838
LIAM: Nine for the second.

2095
02:13:56,838 --> 02:14:03,667
MATT: Great. The two daggers pierce, vanish in
place, come back to you.

2096
02:14:03,667 --> 02:14:07,334
LIAM: Can I use the rest of my movement to drop
behind the tree and go into a crouch?

2097
02:14:07,334 --> 02:14:11,588
MATT: Yeah. You leap just beneath and if you want
to use your bonus action-- no, you used your bonus

2098
02:14:11,588 --> 02:14:12,464
action.

2099
02:14:12,464 --> 02:14:13,628
LIAM: Yeah, so I'm done.

2100
02:14:13,628 --> 02:14:17,765
MATT: You're done. That gives you three-quarters
cover, though, from behind anywhere from that

2101
02:14:17,765 --> 02:14:18,612
angle.

2102
02:14:18,612 --> 02:14:22,548
LAURA: Could I have had Trinket run over to the
tree where Percy is?

2103
02:14:22,548 --> 02:14:28,232
MATT: Yeah. He's behind Percy now. All right, that
comes to Keyleth.

2104
02:14:28,232 --> 02:14:40,170
MARISHA: Okay, I stand up, very irritated, and I
grab Percy, and I pull him to me, and I cast Heal

2105
02:14:40,170 --> 02:14:47,670
on him, my 6th-level spell. I'm fucking burning it
for you. So full 70 points because he's almost down.

2106
02:14:47,670 --> 02:14:50,979
LAURA: I thought it was a group spell. Is it not?

2107
02:14:50,979 --> 02:14:57,672
MARISHA: It's not! I should have grabbed Mass Cure
Wounds, but I was wrong. So I grab Percy and I

2108
02:14:57,672 --> 02:15:07,907
say: Fucking finish this bitch. Finish this. I let
him go, and that's my turn. Healing Percy.

2109
02:15:07,907 --> 02:15:11,185
TALIESIN: I'm not at full, but I'm much better.

2110
02:15:11,185 --> 02:15:13,290
MARISHA: Fucking kill her, man!

2111
02:15:13,290 --> 02:15:21,289
TALIESIN: You're probably down next to me with
some cover, though. Probably not up.

2112
02:15:21,289 --> 02:15:25,238
MARISHA: I'm going to my last whatever movement I
have to step back a little bit, because I'm really

2113
02:15:25,238 --> 02:15:32,553
fucked up. If I can step back, whatever I can. I
know I stood up, so I know I have half movement.

2114
02:15:32,553 --> 02:15:34,860
MATT: You have three. You can get behind Trinket.

2115
02:15:34,860 --> 02:15:38,013
MARISHA: I'll get behind Trinket, and I'm not
looking good.

2116
02:15:38,013 --> 02:15:44,473
MATT: Grog, after you see the guy back up and you
start lurching forward, you faintly hear out of

2117
02:15:44,473 --> 02:15:48,648
the corner of your ear a rustle, and your eye
turns over just in time to see a hooded figure

2118
02:15:48,648 --> 02:15:56,520
leap out with a blade in hand towards you from
behind. That is going to be, with advantage

2119
02:15:56,520 --> 02:16:02,336
against you, 26 to hit.

2120
02:16:02,336 --> 02:16:07,349
TRAVIS: That hits. I have danger sense, advantage
on dex saving throws, dodge, traps and spells.

2121
02:16:07,349 --> 02:16:09,196
MATT: Doesn't help you in this.

2122
02:16:09,196 --> 02:16:10,596
LAURA: Traps and spells?!

2123
02:16:10,596 --> 02:16:13,782
MATT: Yeah, which he got advantage on the saving
throw.

2124
02:16:13,782 --> 02:16:15,560
TRAVIS: 26 hits.

2125
02:16:15,560 --> 02:16:27,160
MATT: You feel something cold and painful sink
into your back and your muscles tense up. You take--

2126
02:16:27,160 --> 02:16:33,042
MARISHA: I'm really tapped out. Not looking good.

2127
02:16:33,042 --> 02:16:37,239
MATT: From the sneak attack--

2128
02:16:37,239 --> 02:16:39,935
TRAVIS: Oh, sneak attack.

2129
02:16:39,935 --> 02:16:41,778
TALIESIN: Kill her.

2130
02:16:41,778 --> 02:16:48,908
MATT: 28 points of slashing damage.

2131
02:16:48,908 --> 02:16:50,758
TRAVIS: Halved to 14.

2132
02:16:50,758 --> 02:17:05,809
MATT: Halved to 14. Through your back from the
blade. Surprised that the impact didn't take as

2133
02:17:05,809 --> 02:17:12,905
well as it did, pulls the blade out. Looking at
the blood curling on the edge of the blade, you

2134
02:17:12,905 --> 02:17:20,769
glance over your shoulder at this thug-like
figure. Young man, looking a little scared. That

2135
02:17:20,769 --> 02:17:39,665
brings us to the goliath. Sees you. Dashes
forward, takes no action, pulls out a shield and a

2136
02:17:39,665 --> 02:17:45,709
big old thick broadsword. Comes up, yelling at
you, getting your attention full-on gladiatoral

2137
02:17:45,709 --> 02:17:52,617
warrior-on-warrior combat,. Shield at the ready,
ready to tussle with you. Scanlan, you're up.

2138
02:17:52,617 --> 02:18:00,128
SAM: Me? Jesus, I can't do shit. I get up. Those
are holes, craters?

2139
02:18:00,128 --> 02:18:07,975
MATT: Yeah. It's a gradual crevasse that comes
down and comes up to these points here with the

2140
02:18:07,975 --> 02:18:09,923
ground that's been blown out.

2141
02:18:09,923 --> 02:18:18,389
SAM: Okay. I get up to the edge. I can only run
another 15 feet or something, right?

2142
02:18:18,389 --> 02:18:20,269
MATT: Yeah, roughly.

2143
02:18:20,269 --> 02:18:34,855
SAM: I get closer to the edge as far as I can.
Shit. Man, I can't do much. How far apart are the

2144
02:18:34,855 --> 02:18:37,361
farthest of the far?

2145
02:18:37,361 --> 02:18:42,672
MATT: Both of these guys are about 25, 30 feet
from each other.

2146
02:18:42,672 --> 02:18:44,940
SAM: How about that one and the next one?

2147
02:18:44,940 --> 02:18:50,104
MATT: That one and the next one there? They would
be roughly 65, 70 feet apart.

2148
02:18:50,104 --> 02:18:54,815
SAM: Okay.

2149
02:18:54,815 --> 02:19:04,264
TALIESIN: You take your action to cry?

2150
02:19:04,264 --> 02:19:09,822
SAM: Yeah. I'll fire a Fireball to those two in
the corner.

2151
02:19:09,822 --> 02:19:10,993
LAURA: That's good!

2152
02:19:10,993 --> 02:19:14,521
MATT: Two dex saves.

2153
02:19:14,521 --> 02:19:19,225
TRAVIS: Oh man, we're in it, y'all, we're fucking
in it!

2154
02:19:19,225 --> 02:19:26,410
MATT: The DC is 15. The robed one succeeds, so
takes half damage. The gunner rolled a natural

2155
02:19:26,410 --> 02:19:34,935
one. Roll that 8d6 damage. Percy, you're almost
up. We have one more turn before you after this,

2156
02:19:34,935 --> 02:19:36,880
so be prepared.

2157
02:19:36,880 --> 02:19:38,510
TALIESIN: Oh god.

2158
02:19:38,510 --> 02:19:42,966
SAM: That's good. 35.

2159
02:19:42,966 --> 02:20:00,857
MATT: 17 fire damage to that one and that gunner
there. (explosion) Another fiery explosion, you

2160
02:20:00,857 --> 02:20:07,367
can see the streak from the wand of Scanlan in the
distance. This tree begins to catch fire as it's

2161
02:20:07,367 --> 02:20:13,690
one of the few not fully burned, petrified trees.
It's going to curl up. The robed figure ducks out

2162
02:20:13,690 --> 02:20:20,066
of the way and manages to avoid some of the impact.
The figure that's already been stabbed and shot by

2163
02:20:20,066 --> 02:20:27,170
arrows takes the full brunt of it and is looking
charred, burnt, and barely holding on right now.

2164
02:20:27,170 --> 02:20:32,070
SAM: For my bonus action, can I take a
potion. Is that bonus-able action?

2165
02:20:32,070 --> 02:20:35,433
MATT: I'm letting it, yeah. You can take a potion
as a bonus.

2166
02:20:35,433 --> 02:20:37,294
SAM: Okay, I'll take a greater, which is how
many?

2167
02:20:37,294 --> 02:20:39,217
MATT: Greater is 4d4 plus four.

2168
02:20:39,217 --> 02:20:41,270
MATT: 4d4 plus four.

2169
02:20:41,270 --> 02:20:54,760
TRAVIS: Shit, man, what a map! I'm so excited!
Like a pair of crater breasts coming out of the ground.

2170
02:20:54,760 --> 02:20:59,259
SAM: That's my move. See you in a half hour.

2171
02:20:59,259 --> 02:21:02,350
TALIESIN: We'll send him out.

2172
02:21:02,350 --> 02:21:16,657
SAM: How many more attackers don't we see?

2173
02:21:16,657 --> 02:21:19,969
TALIESIN: They are the Hong Kong Cavaliers still
at the ready.

2174
02:21:19,969 --> 02:21:22,341
MARISHA: It's like the Crazy 88; they just keep
coming.

2175
02:21:22,341 --> 02:21:27,079
MATT: Uses a bonus action to Misty Step.

2176
02:21:27,079 --> 02:21:28,533
LAURA: Damn it.

2177
02:21:28,533 --> 02:21:31,223
MATT: Onto there.

2178
02:21:31,223 --> 02:21:33,839
TALIESIN: Good. That's funny.

2179
02:21:33,839 --> 02:21:35,359
LAURA: That's at eye level.

2180
02:21:35,359 --> 02:21:36,743
TRAVIS: That's on our level.

2181
02:21:36,743 --> 02:21:41,703
MATT: Robed figure-- Yeah, it's up at eye level.
Stands there on the edge, lifts the staff up, the

2182
02:21:41,703 --> 02:21:46,792
hand begins to glow in a shimmer of rainbows, and
as the hand comes down like this, the rainbow

2183
02:21:46,792 --> 02:21:54,680
blasts out in front of it with a sudden,
nearly-blinding show of magical arcane force. Did

2184
02:21:54,680 --> 02:21:58,978
I get my templates? Because I'm going to need a
template there, Ryan.

2185
02:21:58,978 --> 02:22:03,619
LIAM: You have no template, it misses everybody.
That's how it works.

2186
02:22:03,619 --> 02:22:06,233
MATT: I don't see them in there.

2187
02:22:06,233 --> 02:22:13,243
SAM: Sorry, before you do this. Before you spend
all this time. Is this one 60 feet away from me?

2188
02:22:13,243 --> 02:22:16,418
MATT: It is within 60 feet.

2189
02:22:16,418 --> 02:22:18,511
SAM: I am going to Counterspell that.

2190
02:22:18,511 --> 02:22:19,740
TALIESIN: You are a beautiful person.

2191
02:22:19,740 --> 02:22:24,482
MATT: You're using your action to Counterspell? Go
ahead and roll, adding six plus two, so plus eight

2192
02:22:24,482 --> 02:22:25,866
to this.

2193
02:22:25,866 --> 02:22:27,180
SAM: It's a d20?

2194
02:22:27,180 --> 02:22:28,764
MATT: It's a d20, add eight.

2195
02:22:28,764 --> 02:22:33,592
SAM: Fuck you. 12.

2196
02:22:33,592 --> 02:22:39,511
MATT: 12. I had an interesting thought, here.

2197
02:22:39,511 --> 02:22:42,258
MARISHA: I like interesting thoughts.

2198
02:22:42,258 --> 02:22:44,595
LIAM: You don't need those.

2199
02:22:44,595 --> 02:22:48,250
TALIESIN: Oh, look, they made little caskets for
all of our figures.

2200
02:22:48,250 --> 02:22:54,320
MATT: Peerless skill. You can add one of our own
bardic inspirations to an ability check if you

2201
02:22:54,320 --> 02:22:57,747
want to. It is technically an ability check.

2202
02:22:57,747 --> 02:22:59,863
SAM: I can inspire myself?

2203
02:22:59,863 --> 02:23:01,631
MATT: Yeah, it's an ability you got at level 14.

2204
02:23:01,631 --> 02:23:05,313
SAM: To inspire myself, I take a big handful of
fusaka.

2205
02:23:05,313 --> 02:23:09,574
(laughter)

2206
02:23:09,574 --> 02:23:14,536
MATT: You can roll the d10 and add that.

2207
02:23:14,536 --> 02:23:19,586
LIAM: Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys!

2208
02:23:19,586 --> 02:23:23,336
SAM: Another four. Only up to 16.

2209
02:23:23,336 --> 02:23:25,726
MATT: 16's not going to be enough.

2210
02:23:25,726 --> 02:23:27,358
SAM: Terrible rolls!

2211
02:23:27,358 --> 02:23:28,820
LIAM: What a visual!

2212
02:23:28,820 --> 02:23:30,993
SAM: I got spice in my nose.

2213
02:23:30,993 --> 02:23:35,260
MATT: Only catches those two, unfortunately.
Wasn't quite as good as he was hoping.

2214
02:23:35,260 --> 02:23:36,978
SAM: And neither was I

2215
02:23:36,978 --> 02:23:43,750
MATT: Actually, it would get-- no. Trinket's
barely misses.

2216
02:23:43,750 --> 02:23:45,997
LIAM: Tickle on his nose.

2217
02:23:45,997 --> 02:23:48,264
MARISHA: I'm hiding behind Trinket.

2218
02:23:48,264 --> 02:23:53,719
MATT: I need a dexterity saving throw from
Percival and from Scanlan.

2219
02:23:53,719 --> 02:23:55,236
MARISHA: Come on, Percy.

2220
02:23:55,236 --> 02:23:56,871
LAURA: Natural 20.

2221
02:23:56,871 --> 02:23:58,483
TALIESIN: No, but good enough.

2222
02:23:58,483 --> 02:23:59,512
SAM: 24.

2223
02:23:59,512 --> 02:24:00,972
TALIESIN: 18.

2224
02:24:00,972 --> 02:24:02,447
MATT: 18?

2225
02:24:02,447 --> 02:24:07,929
TALIESIN: Is it too late to reroll that?

2226
02:24:07,929 --> 02:24:11,728
MATT: No, you have the ability, Indomitable, as a
fighter to do that. Scanlan, what'd you roll?

2227
02:24:11,728 --> 02:24:12,809
SAM: 24.

2228
02:24:12,809 --> 02:24:14,068
MATT: 24 dexterity saving throw?

2229
02:24:14,068 --> 02:24:15,249
SAM: I rolled a 19.

2230
02:24:15,249 --> 02:24:16,387
MATT: Nice!

2231
02:24:16,387 --> 02:24:18,967
TALIESIN: No, no better.

2232
02:24:18,967 --> 02:24:25,916
MATT: Well, he gets 10d6 fire damage to you as one
of the red rays strikes into you, Percy.

2233
02:24:25,916 --> 02:24:29,900
TRAVIS: Rainbows are a motherfucker!

2234
02:24:29,900 --> 02:24:33,441
TALIESIN: I would have been dead!

2235
02:24:33,441 --> 02:24:37,685
MARISHA: People made fun of Thor walking across
that rainbow bridge.

2236
02:24:37,685 --> 02:24:44,530
TALIESIN: Stop making that face. It can't kill
me.

2237
02:24:44,530 --> 02:24:47,170
MATT: 15 points of fire damage to you, Percy.

2238
02:24:47,170 --> 02:24:49,679
TALIESIN: 15? That's fine.

2239
02:24:49,679 --> 02:24:57,607
MATT: Would have been 30. That is really shitty
rolls on that one. Wait, Percy, you failed, so you

2240
02:24:57,607 --> 02:25:01,710
take full damage, sorry. So it is 31 points of
fire damage.

2241
02:25:01,710 --> 02:25:03,498
TALIESIN: I'm still fine, thanks to you.

2242
02:25:03,498 --> 02:25:07,372
MATT: I rolled an eight, so that's two rays
against you, Scanlan.

2243
02:25:07,372 --> 02:25:09,446
SAM: Is this Prismatic Spray?

2244
02:25:09,446 --> 02:25:10,598
MATT: It is!

2245
02:25:10,598 --> 02:25:12,588
SAM: Oh shit. That's a good spell.

2246
02:25:12,588 --> 02:25:19,892
MATT: That's yellow against you, and orange. So
that's 20d6 damage.

2247
02:25:19,892 --> 02:25:21,944
LAURA: 20d6?!

2248
02:25:21,944 --> 02:25:28,053
MATT: Thankfully, you made your save, so it's half
each. Lightning and acid. However, the acid you

2249
02:25:28,053 --> 02:25:29,236
have resistance to.

2250
02:25:29,236 --> 02:25:30,467
SAM: I do!

2251
02:25:30,467 --> 02:25:31,549
TALIESIN: So that's halved again.

2252
02:25:31,549 --> 02:25:32,688
TRAVIS: Did he say 20?

2253
02:25:32,688 --> 02:25:33,813
LAURA: 20d6!

2254
02:25:33,813 --> 02:25:42,369
MATT: 10d6. The acid you would take would be 47,
reduced to 23. So you take 23 acid damage.

2255
02:25:42,369 --> 02:25:44,945
LIAM: You're welcome for that armor.

2256
02:25:44,945 --> 02:25:53,861
MATT: 38 points of lightning damage reduced to--
for the acid damage, you took half of that, as

2257
02:25:53,861 --> 02:25:56,107
well. How much did I say you took?

2258
02:25:56,107 --> 02:25:57,286
SAM: 23.

2259
02:25:57,286 --> 02:26:02,673
MATT: 23. That's reduced in half because of your
resistance. That brings it to 11 points of acid

2260
02:26:02,673 --> 02:26:03,992
damage.

2261
02:26:03,992 --> 02:26:05,630
SAM: Just going down and down. I like this.

2262
02:26:05,630 --> 02:26:07,891
MATT: Then you take 16 points of lightning
damage.

2263
02:26:07,891 --> 02:26:11,319
SAM: That's much better than those other numbers
that you were saying.

2264
02:26:11,319 --> 02:26:13,044
TALIESIN: Those were bad numbers.

2265
02:26:13,044 --> 02:26:16,697
MATT: You roll 1d8 when it's cast, and on you I
rolled an eight, which means you get two rays.

2266
02:26:16,697 --> 02:26:19,183
Thank god you had resistance and you made your
save.

2267
02:26:19,183 --> 02:26:20,675
SAM: That's a cool spell.

2268
02:26:20,675 --> 02:26:23,736
TRAVIS: The colors determine the--

2269
02:26:23,736 --> 02:26:31,870
MATT: What happens, yeah. It's everything in a
60-foot cone. Was hoping he was a little closer.

2270
02:26:31,870 --> 02:26:34,442
LAURA: What level spell is that?

2271
02:26:34,442 --> 02:26:35,639
MATT: That's a 7th.

2272
02:26:35,639 --> 02:26:39,077
MARISHA: It's like a Pink Floyd tribute concert.

2273
02:26:39,077 --> 02:26:41,904
MATT: That was his big one.

2274
02:26:41,904 --> 02:26:44,582
LAURA: Could he have Misty-Stepped closer to us?

2275
02:26:44,582 --> 02:26:46,818
MATT: Not with that crevasse, unfortunately.

2276
02:26:46,818 --> 02:26:49,811
TRAVIS: Some would call it a "cre-vase."

2277
02:26:49,811 --> 02:26:56,942
MATT: I will fight you. Truly, I will fight you, I
have two guys fighting you. Percival, you're up.

2278
02:26:56,942 --> 02:27:01,612
TALIESIN: In theory, I'm able to sense my Hex.

2279
02:27:01,612 --> 02:27:04,785
MATT: You can't right now, no.

2280
02:27:04,785 --> 02:27:07,140
TALIESIN: I'm not sensing my Hex? Not at all?

2281
02:27:07,140 --> 02:27:08,171
MATT: No.

2282
02:27:08,171 --> 02:27:10,229
MARISHA: She's got a magical cloak of fuckery.

2283
02:27:10,229 --> 02:27:11,454
TRAVIS: Yeah, she does.

2284
02:27:11,454 --> 02:27:15,050
LAURA: She's a bitch.

2285
02:27:15,050 --> 02:27:23,118
TALIESIN: That's fine. There's really no point of
even moving, at this point. I'm just on fire. I'm

2286
02:27:23,118 --> 02:27:31,096
going to pull out the Retort pistol, and I'm going
to shoot that wizard in the chest with some fun.

2287
02:27:31,096 --> 02:27:33,049
I'm going take three shots at him.

2288
02:27:33,049 --> 02:27:34,348
MATT: Okay, go for it.

2289
02:27:34,348 --> 02:27:42,482
TALIESIN: The first is a Sharpshooter shot. That's
27.

2290
02:27:42,482 --> 02:27:45,466
MATT: 27 to hit, with the minus from
Sharpshooter?

2291
02:27:45,466 --> 02:27:49,247
TALIESIN: With the minus. I rolled really well. 24
to hit, I'm sorry.

2292
02:27:49,247 --> 02:27:50,805
MATT: 24 to hit? Yeah, that hits.

2293
02:27:50,805 --> 02:27:52,246
TALIESIN: Actually, it's 27.

2294
02:27:52,246 --> 02:27:53,865
MATT: Make up your mind, man!

2295
02:27:53,865 --> 02:27:59,971
TALIESIN: I'm really angry right now. I'm
genuinely angry. I can't even roll. Should I count

2296
02:27:59,971 --> 02:28:02,073
that or not? Should I reroll it?

2297
02:28:02,073 --> 02:28:04,586
MARISHA: It was good, but you have to reroll it.
I'm sorry, man.

2298
02:28:04,586 --> 02:28:07,356
MATT: Wasn't an intentional roll? Reroll.

2299
02:28:07,356 --> 02:28:08,915
MARISHA: Oh! Same thing!

2300
02:28:08,915 --> 02:28:15,528
TALIESIN: That's 26 points of piercing damage.
What the hell?!

2301
02:28:15,528 --> 02:28:22,928
MATT: The bullet hits. You see the robed figure,
the hood flies back. You see a man in his 40s with

2302
02:28:22,928 --> 02:28:27,626
a chinstrap beard. He's still holding his staff,
keeping himself there.

2303
02:28:27,626 --> 02:28:36,759
TALIESIN: I am so calm, doing this. I'm going to
shoot again, same thing. That's 12.

2304
02:28:36,759 --> 02:28:43,654
MATT: 12 does not hit. This time, you go to fire,
and the mage, now aware of your presence and what

2305
02:28:43,654 --> 02:28:46,088
you're firing at him, ducks out of the way, and it
shoots past.

2306
02:28:46,088 --> 02:28:52,784
TALIESIN: I'm going to burn a grit and I'm going
to do a torso shot, because that'll be funny. No

2307
02:28:52,784 --> 02:28:54,289
Sharpshooter.

2308
02:28:54,289 --> 02:28:55,880
LIAM: Percival: fan of comedy.

2309
02:28:55,880 --> 02:29:02,345
TALIESIN: I am. It is hilariously funny as
possible. Oh, and there's no save for this, it's

2310
02:29:02,345 --> 02:29:09,061
just if I hit. Come on, be cool. That's cool
enough. 21.

2311
02:29:09,061 --> 02:29:17,149
MATT: 21. As a reaction, the mage is going to
throw up a Shield spell, seeing it coming towards

2312
02:29:17,149 --> 02:29:22,686
him, adding to his AC. The bullet, while it should
have hit the torso, ricochets off an arcane shield

2313
02:29:22,686 --> 02:29:26,224
that shimmers briefly in place, having no impact,
unfortunately.

2314
02:29:26,224 --> 02:29:45,144
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my bonus to have a
greater potion. That's 4d4 plus four?

2315
02:29:45,144 --> 02:29:46,659
MATT: 4d4 plus four, yes.

2316
02:29:46,659 --> 02:29:53,096
TALIESIN: And then I'm going to make sure that I
look the wizard in the eye, and I'm going to yell

2317
02:29:53,096 --> 02:30:01,052
to him: You're not leaving here alive! You're
going to die. As I reload. Well, I can't reload

2318
02:30:01,052 --> 02:30:02,465
yet, but I'll reload in a second.

2319
02:30:02,465 --> 02:30:05,056
MATT: All right, that ends your turn, Percival.
Grog you're up.

2320
02:30:05,137 --> 02:30:14,970
TRAVIS: Now that I've got two playfellows, we're
on the edge of the crevasse, right?

2321
02:30:14,970 --> 02:30:15,992
MATT: Correct. Yes.

2322
02:30:15,992 --> 02:30:23,707
TRAVIS: Yeah. Can I try to push the goliath into
the-- can I go into a frenzied rage as my bonus

2323
02:30:23,707 --> 02:30:28,120
action? And can I use my first attack to try to
shove the goliath into the crevasse?

2324
02:30:28,120 --> 02:30:31,510
MATT: You'll have to move to push her.

2325
02:30:31,510 --> 02:30:33,442
TRAVIS: Can I move?

2326
02:30:33,442 --> 02:30:36,620
MATT: Yeah, you shift around that way. You'd get
an attack of opportunity from the rogue.

2327
02:30:36,620 --> 02:30:38,944
TRAVIS: Worth it.

2328
02:30:38,944 --> 02:30:47,766
MATT: And I would say, so you're aware, usually
it's like when you go into a rage you choose to

2329
02:30:47,766 --> 02:30:51,387
frenzy rage, but I've always liked the idea of you
going into a frenzy if you want to. I don't think

2330
02:30:51,387 --> 02:30:52,979
it takes an action to do so.

2331
02:30:52,979 --> 02:30:54,646
TRAVIS: Yeah. Okay. I thought it was a bonus.

2332
02:30:54,646 --> 02:30:55,992
MATT: It's a bonus action to rage.

2333
02:30:55,992 --> 02:30:57,440
TRAVIS: Yeah. I thought frenzy was also.

2334
02:30:57,440 --> 02:30:59,972
MATT: Yeah, you're fine. You go into it. All
right, so you'll move.

2335
02:30:59,972 --> 02:31:01,939
TRAVIS: Yeah, just one over.

2336
02:31:01,939 --> 02:31:12,637
MATT: One over this way. The rogue goes to strike
you. That is 21?

2337
02:31:12,637 --> 02:31:13,840
TRAVIS: That'll hit.

2338
02:31:13,840 --> 02:31:17,137
MATT: That hits. It is not sneak attack right now
because he already used it until it comes back to

2339
02:31:17,137 --> 02:31:25,579
his turn. So you take ten points of piercing
damage reduced to five. As he swipes at you, cuts

2340
02:31:25,579 --> 02:31:29,805
barely across your back and you move into place.
Okay now the goliath turns her shield up in front

2341
02:31:29,805 --> 02:31:30,926
of you.

2342
02:31:30,926 --> 02:31:33,628
TRAVIS: For my reckless attack, I'd like to try
and push her into the crevasse.

2343
02:31:33,628 --> 02:31:38,403
MATT: Okay, so the first strike, make your
athletics check, I think?

2344
02:31:38,403 --> 02:31:40,651
TRAVIS: Nice. Athletics?

2345
02:31:40,651 --> 02:31:43,029
MATT:This would be your athletics versus hers.
Yeah.

2346
02:31:43,029 --> 02:31:44,339
TRAVIS: 27.

2347
02:31:44,339 --> 02:31:50,417
MATT: You push her back five feet there, and you
push into that space there. First attack, she puts

2348
02:31:50,417 --> 02:31:54,960
the shield up and as you slam into the shield,
slides against, you see all the glass building up

2349
02:31:54,960 --> 02:31:58,152
behind her ankles and tumbling into the crevasse
behind her.

2350
02:31:58,152 --> 02:31:59,583
TRAVIS: I do another.

2351
02:31:59,583 --> 02:32:00,843
MATT: All right go for it. Roll again.

2352
02:32:00,843 --> 02:32:04,974
TRAVIS: Yes! 23.

2353
02:32:04,974 --> 02:32:11,454
MATT: That is a 13, as she stands there with her
blade at the ready, getting ready to arc down with

2354
02:32:11,454 --> 02:32:17,886
the counterattack, you slam into her shield and
she (yells) falls backward, tumbling into the

2355
02:32:17,886 --> 02:32:29,676
crevasse. Down into the pile in the center.
She takes 15 points of damage from the impact and

2356
02:32:29,676 --> 02:32:35,151
the shards of broken, jagged glass that are at the
bottom of it from the explosion before and she's

2357
02:32:35,151 --> 02:32:37,014
like (groans) on the ground.

2358
02:32:37,014 --> 02:32:39,750
TRAVIS: Can I look over my shoulder at the rogue?

2359
02:32:39,750 --> 02:32:41,693
MATT: Yes, you can.

2360
02:32:41,693 --> 02:32:43,456
TRAVIS: Because he's got the little dagger,
right?

2361
02:32:43,456 --> 02:32:44,382
MATT: Yeah.

2362
02:32:44,382 --> 02:32:54,015
TRAVIS: Can I say: Sit down before I open you up!
And I would like to take off towards the guy that

2363
02:32:54,015 --> 02:32:59,045
I was first engaged with that's at the back corner
of the map with the rest of my movement. I have

2364
02:32:59,045 --> 02:33:14,575
one attack left. Yeah. Reckless, please, chef.
25.

2365
02:33:14,575 --> 02:33:16,576
MATT: Yeah, that'll hit.

2366
02:33:16,576 --> 02:33:20,916
TALIESIN: Turn him into paste, please.

2367
02:33:20,916 --> 02:33:24,670
TRAVIS: 17, with two points of necrotic damage.

2368
02:33:24,670 --> 02:33:31,660
MATT: 17. You rush up and slash across with the
axe. He puts up the rifle to try and keep it at

2369
02:33:31,660 --> 02:33:37,935
bay. You cut through the rifle, cutting it in
half, and the blade impacts in the chest. Pushes

2370
02:33:37,935 --> 02:33:42,789
and pulls the weapon out as you pull backward,
ready for another strike. A big streak of blood

2371
02:33:42,789 --> 02:33:47,304
pours out from the wound. He's standing, but
looking extremely hurt.

2372
02:33:47,304 --> 02:33:49,547
LAURA: And his rifle's broken.

2373
02:33:49,547 --> 02:33:52,471
MATT: All right, that ends your turn?

2374
02:33:52,471 --> 02:33:57,254
TRAVIS: I have Retaliation. I forgot about it.
That's all right.

2375
02:33:57,254 --> 02:33:59,194
TALIESIN: If he tries to run, you'll kill him,
anyway.

2376
02:33:59,194 --> 02:34:03,549
TRAVIS: If somebody tries to hit me within five
feet with melee, I can hit him back but I forgot

2377
02:34:03,549 --> 02:34:04,585
to do it.

2378
02:34:04,585 --> 02:34:06,929
SAM: Even on an attack of opportunity, you mean?

2379
02:34:06,929 --> 02:34:09,879
MATT: Yeah. He has the ability to use his reaction
to attack someone back immediately.

2380
02:34:09,879 --> 02:34:11,460
TALIESIN: You can only do it once per round.

2381
02:34:11,460 --> 02:34:16,746
MATT: Once per round, yeah. All right. Suddenly,
(whoosh).

2382
02:34:16,746 --> 02:34:18,239
SAM: Who that?

2383
02:34:18,239 --> 02:34:24,628
MATT: Ripley reappears ten feet from where she was
before, and you can still see the smoke pouring

2384
02:34:24,628 --> 02:34:31,750
off of her, the presence very easy to see of
Orthax now bound to her, the inspiration for her

2385
02:34:31,750 --> 02:34:38,307
recent designs in carrying on the legacy that you
chose to end. And as she appears, she goes and

2386
02:34:38,307 --> 02:34:43,822
takes aim with her refined pepperbox across the
way at you, Percy.

2387
02:34:43,822 --> 02:34:45,296
TALIESIN: Yes, she does.

2388
02:34:45,296 --> 02:34:51,246
SAM: You get advantage against bullets, right?

2389
02:34:51,246 --> 02:34:54,936
TALIESIN: I don't. Although I do have cover. I
don't have full cover. I have some cover.

2390
02:34:54,936 --> 02:34:57,922
MATT: No, you have half cover, which is a plus
five to your AC. She rolled a 28.

2391
02:34:57,922 --> 02:35:04,123
TALIESIN: That'll hit. Adds five to my AC,
currently?

2392
02:35:04,123 --> 02:35:14,028
MATT: Yes. So the first one hits. The second
strike, she's going to spend a grit point to

2393
02:35:14,028 --> 02:35:19,635
Violent Shot. That is a 26?

2394
02:35:19,635 --> 02:35:21,467
TALIESIN: That also hits.

2395
02:35:21,467 --> 02:35:30,447
MATT: Okay. And a third strike, she's going to
Headshot you.

2396
02:35:30,447 --> 02:35:33,354
TALIESIN: That's funny and useless, but okay.

2397
02:35:33,354 --> 02:35:35,514
MATT: That's all right. That was a natural one.

2398
02:35:35,514 --> 02:35:37,703
LAURA: Misfire?!

2399
02:35:37,703 --> 02:35:44,669
MATT: It misfires. The first two shots hit, but
the third one misfires. So with her refined

2400
02:35:44,669 --> 02:35:50,939
pepperbox she takes aim (gunfire) takes a shot.
Actually, before she does that, she bonus actions

2401
02:35:50,939 --> 02:35:58,115
towards you, and you feel a similar feeling take
over you as you now, Percy.

2402
02:35:58,115 --> 02:36:01,140
LIAM and TRAVIS: Nega-Percy!

2403
02:36:01,140 --> 02:36:04,506
SAM: Why don't you marry her?

2404
02:36:04,506 --> 02:36:08,845
TALIESIN This whole fight's going to end with us
kissing. We're going to start making out. It's

2405
02:36:08,845 --> 02:36:11,474
going to be a big ugly makeout.

2406
02:36:11,474 --> 02:36:27,472
MATT: So the first shot with this is going to be
12 points of piercing damage from the first

2407
02:36:27,472 --> 02:36:37,083
strike, plus two psychic, as the impact hits you
and you feel this shocking ring in your head. You

2408
02:36:37,083 --> 02:36:41,522
see a flash suddenly in your mind of the
dark-shadowed face of Orthax laughing.

2409
02:36:41,522 --> 02:36:42,720
TALIESIN: 14 points total?

2410
02:36:42,720 --> 02:36:43,946
MATT: Yes.

2411
02:36:43,946 --> 02:36:45,192
TALIESIN: All right.

2412
02:36:45,192 --> 02:36:54,304
MATT: Second shot, which is a Violent Shot, on hit
has double dice value. So that's 18 points of

2413
02:36:54,304 --> 02:36:55,575
piercing damage.

2414
02:36:55,575 --> 02:36:57,457
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and slow it down with a
catch.

2415
02:36:57,457 --> 02:36:59,668
MATT: Okay. Plus four psychic.

2416
02:36:59,668 --> 02:37:02,342
TALIESIN: So I'm going to try and lower that 18.

2417
02:37:02,342 --> 02:37:03,833
MATT: Go for it.

2418
02:37:03,833 --> 02:37:08,030
TALIESIN: Ooh! I lower it by 14 points.

2419
02:37:08,030 --> 02:37:11,704
MATT: Okay. You catch the bullet, and for the most
part it still pierces through.

2420
02:37:11,704 --> 02:37:14,946
TALIESIN: So four points of damage plus four
psychic.

2421
02:37:14,946 --> 02:37:16,303
MATT: Plus four psychic so eight total.

2422
02:37:16,303 --> 02:37:18,046
SAM: Wow, you caught a bullet.

2423
02:37:18,046 --> 02:37:20,064
TALIESIN: They don't move that fast.

2424
02:37:20,064 --> 02:37:23,865
MATT: The third gun. "Shit."

2425
02:37:23,865 --> 02:37:30,307
TALIESIN: (laughs) I'm going to be laughing my ass
off for a minute.

2426
02:37:30,307 --> 02:37:34,949
MATT: And you watch as she goes, "Very well." And
vanishes again from sight.

2427
02:37:34,949 --> 02:37:36,995
LAURA: Ugh! I hate her.

2428
02:37:36,995 --> 02:37:41,147
LIAM and LAURA: She's a bitch.

2429
02:37:41,147 --> 02:37:48,932
MATT: That brings us to the gunner's turn. This
one here is going to go ahead and it's horribly

2430
02:37:48,932 --> 02:37:54,919
wounded. This one, the rifle misfired, if I
recall.

2431
02:37:54,919 --> 02:37:56,249
TALIESIN: Yes.

2432
02:37:56,249 --> 02:38:00,952
MATT: Yes. And has pulled out a pistol. So the
gunner here, using a pistol, is going to take

2433
02:38:00,952 --> 02:38:02,795
three shots at you, Vax.

2434
02:38:02,795 --> 02:38:04,884
LIAM: With disadvantage.

2435
02:38:04,884 --> 02:38:10,650
MATT: With disadvantage on them, correct. Well,
two shots. One, and then a reload, and then one.

2436
02:38:10,650 --> 02:38:18,716
So the first shot with disadvantage, that's a 27
and 24.

2437
02:38:18,716 --> 02:38:20,208
LIAM: That hits.

2438
02:38:20,208 --> 02:38:22,047
MATT: All right, so the disadvantage has faded.

2439
02:38:22,047 --> 02:38:24,070
LIAM: Loses it for the rest of the round.

2440
02:38:24,070 --> 02:38:31,291
MATT: But still. You take from the first hit 12
points of piercing damage, and the second strike

2441
02:38:31,291 --> 02:38:34,184
without disadvantage is terrible. That is a 13.

2442
02:38:34,184 --> 02:38:38,705
LIAM: I'm fine.

2443
02:38:38,705 --> 02:38:45,244
MATT: Rolled a three, but it did not roll enough
to misfire. So reload, last shot fire misses. It's

2444
02:38:45,244 --> 02:38:46,928
going to run this way.

2445
02:38:46,928 --> 02:38:49,075
LIAM: Oh, can I uncanny dodge? Or is it too late?

2446
02:38:49,075 --> 02:38:57,786
MATT: Yeah, you can do that. So half damage. All
righty, the other one who's in front of you, Grog,

2447
02:38:57,786 --> 02:39:02,267
and is scared out of his mind is going to attempt
to step back.

2448
02:39:02,267 --> 02:39:05,784
TRAVIS: Well, that's one way to die.

2449
02:39:05,784 --> 02:39:10,002
MATT: So go ahead and take your-- he does not want
to be in your face.

2450
02:39:10,002 --> 02:39:13,610
TRAVIS: That's 29.

2451
02:39:13,610 --> 02:39:15,117
MATT: That hits. Roll damage.

2452
02:39:15,117 --> 02:39:18,184
TRAVIS: Can I make that Great Weapon-- I have to
say that before.

2453
02:39:18,184 --> 02:39:19,451
MATT: Yeah, no. It's too late.

2454
02:39:19,451 --> 02:39:25,025
TRAVIS: 16 points of damage. One necrotic.

2455
02:39:25,025 --> 02:39:32,285
MATT: 16. You arc back. This time you jam it into
the leg, and you see him now limping, one eye is

2456
02:39:32,285 --> 02:39:37,470
like half closed and swollen, breathing heavy. One
arm is busted and is still holding the pistol up,

2457
02:39:37,470 --> 02:39:42,484
and points it toward you. He's going to take three
shots with the pistol that's already loaded, now

2458
02:39:42,484 --> 02:39:47,692
that he got rid of the big gun. The first one is
going to be (shouting) 12!

2459
02:39:47,692 --> 02:39:48,993
TRAVIS: Misses!

2460
02:39:48,993 --> 02:39:54,273
MATT: You dodge to the side. Next shot is 25.

2461
02:39:54,273 --> 02:39:55,524
TRAVIS: That'll hit.

2462
02:39:55,524 --> 02:40:03,238
MATT: This one will be eight points of piercing
damage.

2463
02:40:03,238 --> 02:40:05,276
TRAVIS: Okay, halved to four.

2464
02:40:05,276 --> 02:40:10,432
MATT: And this one it's going to use all three
grit points that it has to do a triple Violent Shot.

2465
02:40:10,432 --> 02:40:13,128
MARISHA: Wait, that's a thing?

2466
02:40:13,128 --> 02:40:14,884
TALIESIN: That is a thing.

2467
02:40:14,884 --> 02:40:18,025
MARISHA: A triple violent-- why haven't you done
that?

2468
02:40:18,025 --> 02:40:21,825
MATT: It adds more to the misfire score, but it
can add to a lot of damage.

2469
02:40:21,825 --> 02:40:25,666
TALIESIN: No, I very rarely use it because it's a
bad--

2470
02:40:25,666 --> 02:40:26,973
MATT: 22.

2471
02:40:26,973 --> 02:40:28,013
TRAVIS: Hits.

2472
02:40:28,013 --> 02:40:34,584
LAURA: Look, did you see how happy he was about
this? That was the most satisfied smile I've seen

2473
02:40:34,584 --> 02:40:36,379
from Matt in a really long time.

2474
02:40:36,379 --> 02:40:38,861
MARISHA: How are you, Grog? Are you all right?

2475
02:40:38,861 --> 02:40:45,867
MATT: 26 points of piercing damage, reduced to
half.

2476
02:40:45,867 --> 02:40:46,870
TRAVIS: To 13?

2477
02:40:46,870 --> 02:40:53,171
MATT: To 13, yeah. Goes firing at you with the
shots and as you're still standing and taking it

2478
02:40:53,171 --> 02:40:56,277
all, he's shaking and backing up.

2479
02:40:56,277 --> 02:40:59,319
TRAVIS: Yeah, can I lick the ice cream as it's
melting out of me?

2480
02:40:59,319 --> 02:41:01,932
MARISHA: Triple violent shot?

2481
02:41:01,932 --> 02:41:03,504
TALIESIN: I can do a quintuple.

2482
02:41:03,504 --> 02:41:07,313
MATT: All right, that ends the gunner's turn. Vex,
you're up.

2483
02:41:07,313 --> 02:41:15,800
LAURA: Me? Oh. For a bonus action I'm going to
take a greater healing potion. I'm going to do

2484
02:41:15,800 --> 02:41:16,933
that at the end, though.

2485
02:41:16,933 --> 02:41:17,912
MATT: All right.

2486
02:41:17,912 --> 02:41:22,217
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to peek out. Who's seeable?
Is the guy that I've been shooting--

2487
02:41:22,217 --> 02:41:24,534
MATT: Still visible over here, yeah.

2488
02:41:24,534 --> 02:41:25,916
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to shoot him.

2489
02:41:25,916 --> 02:41:27,313
MATT: Go for it.

2490
02:41:27,313 --> 02:41:30,176
LAURA: That is a 30.

2491
02:41:30,176 --> 02:41:43,304
MATT: That'll hit. Oh and Percy, I forgot to add,
nine additional points of necrotic damage from the

2492
02:41:43,304 --> 02:41:45,667
Hex. I forgot to add that to the damage you were
taking.

2493
02:41:45,667 --> 02:41:47,130
TALIESIN: But you forgot.

2494
02:41:47,130 --> 02:41:48,393
MATT: I give it to you all the time.

2495
02:41:48,393 --> 02:41:51,750
TALIESIN: Goddamn it. Okay, are we rolling that?
All right, nine additional points of necrotic?

2496
02:41:51,750 --> 02:41:53,655
LIAM: He can go all night long.

2497
02:41:53,655 --> 02:41:57,135
LAURA: 15. That's with one lightning damage.

2498
02:41:57,135 --> 02:42:02,174
MATT: All right. (grunts)

2499
02:42:02,174 --> 02:42:15,724
LAURA: And then, I'll do it again! That's a fun
thing. Fuck. I can't add. 23.

2500
02:42:15,724 --> 02:42:17,189
MATT: 23 hits.

2501
02:42:17,189 --> 02:42:20,252
LIAM: Off that roll? Holy cow.

2502
02:42:20,252 --> 02:42:31,302
LAURA: 17 points, with three lightning damage.

2503
02:42:31,302 --> 02:42:36,503
MATT: 17 points. The other arrow snaps into her
leg as she's trying to run past (grunts) she

2504
02:42:36,503 --> 02:42:38,307
almost stumbles for a second and has to--

2505
02:42:38,307 --> 02:42:41,985
LAURA: Jeez, they're all still standing! Oh, and
then I'm going to take my potion.

2506
02:42:41,985 --> 02:42:45,053
MATT: Okay, go for it. Vax you're up.

2507
02:42:45,053 --> 02:42:50,391
LIAM: I would like to use my movement and my bonus
action to run. I want to beeline towards the

2508
02:42:50,391 --> 02:42:51,800
rogue. How far do I get?

2509
02:42:51,800 --> 02:42:52,839
MATT: Over there?

2510
02:42:52,839 --> 02:42:55,229
LIAM: Yeah, straight towards him. I don't care how
close I get to the other two.

2511
02:42:55,229 --> 02:42:56,334
MATT: To the crevasse or around it?

2512
02:42:56,334 --> 02:42:57,477
LIAM: Crevasse.

2513
02:42:57,477 --> 02:42:58,482
MARISHA: You're going to jump?

2514
02:42:58,482 --> 02:42:59,593
LIAM: I'm running.

2515
02:42:59,593 --> 02:43:06,978
MATT: 25, 30. Slide down. Moving at this speed
you're taking damage for each one, so you take six

2516
02:43:06,978 --> 02:43:12,791
points of piercing damage, or one point of damage
for each square that you run past in the glass.

2517
02:43:12,791 --> 02:43:14,614
TRAVIS: Oh, six points per square?

2518
02:43:14,614 --> 02:43:17,475
MATT: No, one point per square.

2519
02:43:17,475 --> 02:43:23,424
LIAM: That's as far as I get with movement and
dash? A bonus action dash?

2520
02:43:23,424 --> 02:43:30,484
MATT: I kept forgetting the glass aspect of this.
That's as close as you can get.

2521
02:43:30,484 --> 02:43:37,499
LIAM: And I'll use my action to keep going and as
I close in I shout out: Kynan! You're with us! You

2522
02:43:37,499 --> 02:43:42,638
are not with them, you are with me! Stop this!
Move behind us now!

2523
02:43:42,638 --> 02:43:47,491
MATT: You took a total of 18 points piercing
damage.

2524
02:43:47,491 --> 02:43:49,116
TRAVIS: Who's Kynan?

2525
02:43:49,116 --> 02:43:53,241
MARISHA: Is he the one on the thing? Is he the
mage?

2526
02:43:53,241 --> 02:43:54,773
LIAM: They don't know!

2527
02:43:54,773 --> 02:43:58,075
MATT: It's going to have to be a climb check to
get up, next round. That's as far as you can get,

2528
02:43:58,075 --> 02:43:59,956
you're running through the crevasse as you go.

2529
02:43:59,956 --> 02:44:01,445
LIAM: They don't know.

2530
02:44:01,445 --> 02:44:06,193
LAURA: I ducked back behind that tree after I
shot, by the way. I ducked back behind the tree

2531
02:44:06,193 --> 02:44:07,777
when I shot that person.

2532
02:44:07,777 --> 02:44:09,665
MATT: Okay. There you go. All right.

2533
02:44:09,665 --> 02:44:11,923
LIAM: Charisma roll, persuasion, anything?

2534
02:44:11,923 --> 02:44:17,421
MATT: For this one? As you're ducking through,
you're shouting it out, but you don't even know if

2535
02:44:17,421 --> 02:44:21,193
he's really paying attention at the moment. All
right, ending your turn. Keyleth you're up.

2536
02:44:21,193 --> 02:44:29,206
MARISHA: All right, I am burning my 7th-level
spell and really fucked up behind Trinket, I'm

2537
02:44:29,206 --> 02:44:33,995
going to think about the air elementals on the
beach, and what they just did, and I'm going to

2538
02:44:33,995 --> 02:44:41,028
cast Whirlwind, and I'm going to aim for the mage
on the crevasse booby.

2539
02:44:41,028 --> 02:44:44,272
MATT: (chuckles) All righty.

2540
02:44:44,272 --> 02:44:47,500
LIAM: That mage is right on the nip.

2541
02:44:47,500 --> 02:44:49,107
MARISHA: Right on the nip.

2542
02:44:49,107 --> 02:44:54,237
MATT: All right, so it's a ten-foot radius.

2543
02:44:54,237 --> 02:44:56,109
MARISHA: (laughing) We ruin everything you make.

2544
02:44:56,109 --> 02:44:58,948
LIAM: Anything you do, we will turn into
preschool, Matt.

2545
02:44:58,948 --> 02:45:01,789
TALIESIN: Oh god, I just saw it.

2546
02:45:01,789 --> 02:45:03,369
MATT: So a ten-foot radius.

2547
02:45:03,369 --> 02:45:05,399
MARISHA: Oh, you built this? Looks like a dick.
Okay.

2548
02:45:05,399 --> 02:45:08,010
MATT: I'm going to kill all of you.

2549
02:45:08,010 --> 02:45:10,119
TRAVIS: No, don't! Come on!

2550
02:45:10,119 --> 02:45:13,846
MATT: A 30-foot high cylinder. So you're creating
it here?

2551
02:45:13,846 --> 02:45:17,281
MARISHA: No, over on top of the mage. I have a
300-foot range.

2552
02:45:17,281 --> 02:45:22,136
MATT: All right. So you guys watch as the wind
kicks up--

2553
02:45:22,136 --> 02:45:26,482
MARISHA: Can I get the guy in the crevasse? The
30-foot-high?

2554
02:45:26,482 --> 02:45:28,256
MATT: You could, technically, yeah, if you want
to.

2555
02:45:28,256 --> 02:45:30,076
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll suck them all up.

2556
02:45:30,076 --> 02:45:37,505
MATT: All right. So you watch as a cloud begins to
appear above and shoots down in an instantaneous

2557
02:45:37,505 --> 02:45:42,946
funnel. A tornado slams down into this crevasse,
as Keyleth's eyes glow, her reaching out and

2558
02:45:42,946 --> 02:45:48,989
drawing it to the ground. All right, it sucks up
any medium or smaller objects that aren't secured.

2559
02:45:48,989 --> 02:45:53,521
Creatures make a dexterity saving throw the first
time on a turn that it enters the whirlwind or the

2560
02:45:53,521 --> 02:46:00,194
whirlwind enters its space. So they both have to
make a dex save. The mage, that's an eight. That's

2561
02:46:00,194 --> 02:46:01,444
a nope.

2562
02:46:01,444 --> 02:46:03,109
TALIESIN: What a lovely number.

2563
02:46:03,109 --> 02:46:08,704
MATT: The goliath. That's a 19, and 18 plus one.
What's your DC?

2564
02:46:08,704 --> 02:46:09,950
MARISHA: 19.

2565
02:46:09,950 --> 02:46:14,057
MATT: It succeeds. The goliath does. The mage does
not.

2566
02:46:14,057 --> 02:46:15,417
MARISHA: Oh, the goliath?

2567
02:46:15,417 --> 02:46:17,588
MATT: 10d6 bludgeoning damage, if you could.

2568
02:46:17,588 --> 02:46:18,552
MARISHA: What?

2569
02:46:18,552 --> 02:46:19,994
TRAVIS, TALIESIN and MATT: 10d6.

2570
02:46:19,994 --> 02:46:30,168
MARISHA: 10d6?! It's like Christmas! One, two,
three, four, five, okay. Oh, that's fine! Okay, so

2571
02:46:30,168 --> 02:46:35,535
that's-- wait, what was that? What was that,
Taliesin? I pushed it. Was it a two? It was a

2572
02:46:35,535 --> 02:46:45,335
four? Okay. Six, plus five is 11, plus four is 15,
plus another four is 19, plus another two is 21.

2573
02:46:45,335 --> 02:46:47,067
TALIESIN: Roll them again. That was five.

2574
02:46:47,067 --> 02:46:48,256
MARISHA: That was five!

2575
02:46:48,256 --> 02:46:49,647
MATT: 21, plus?

2576
02:46:49,647 --> 02:47:00,170
MARISHA: Not as good this time. What did I say,
21? 26, 30, 32, 35, 36!

2577
02:47:00,170 --> 02:47:02,647
MATT: 36 bludgeoning damage.

2578
02:47:02,647 --> 02:47:05,147
TALIESIN: And does he get flung?

2579
02:47:05,147 --> 02:47:11,345
MATT: The goliath grapples on to some of the
shards of broken glass, and while taking the

2580
02:47:11,345 --> 02:47:17,671
bludgeoning impact manages to stay in place. The
mage has to make a strength saving throw or become

2581
02:47:17,671 --> 02:47:21,123
restrained in the spell until it ends, and rolls a
two.

2582
02:47:21,123 --> 02:47:26,971
MARISHA: Wait, is he restrained or is he flung?
Because it's vague on what happens.

2583
02:47:26,971 --> 02:47:30,785
LAURA: Personally, I was flung.

2584
02:47:30,785 --> 02:47:36,722
MATT: He is restrained. Restrained means speed
becomes zero, attack rolls against him have

2585
02:47:36,722 --> 02:47:39,243
advantage, and it has disadvantage on dexterity
saving throws.

2586
02:47:39,243 --> 02:47:43,010
MARISHA: He's stuck in a tornado.

2587
02:47:43,010 --> 02:47:51,507
MATT: He can try to use his action to break free,
and then it is hurled from it. But right now it is

2588
02:47:51,507 --> 02:47:53,104
currently held.

2589
02:47:53,104 --> 02:47:56,283
MARISHA: If he tries to break free? Well, that's
fun.

2590
02:47:56,283 --> 02:48:00,468
MATT: When it starts his turn, he begins being
pulled up in the air inside the whirlwind.

2591
02:48:00,468 --> 02:48:05,258
MARISHA: Yeah. I've never done this before, so
this is cool. Yeah.

2592
02:48:05,258 --> 02:48:10,629
MATT: It's pretty cool. All right, cool. And you
can use your move to move the whirlwind 30 feet.

2593
02:48:10,629 --> 02:48:13,582
So now that's he's restrained in it, if you move
the whirlwind elsewhere, he goes with it.

2594
02:48:13,582 --> 02:48:16,119
MARISHA: Can I do that now? Or next turn.

2595
02:48:16,119 --> 02:48:17,553
MATT: You know, you didn't use your movement.

2596
02:48:17,553 --> 02:48:18,781
MARISHA: I didn't!

2597
02:48:18,781 --> 02:48:29,335
MATT: You can move up to 30 feet and possibly pick
up other things if you want to. No one is directly

2598
02:48:29,335 --> 02:48:31,710
nearby, but you can start moving it in a certain
direction, if you'd like.

2599
02:48:31,710 --> 02:48:33,640
TALIESIN: We don't actually know where Ripley is.

2600
02:48:33,640 --> 02:48:35,667
LAURA: Yeah, move it towards where Ripley was!

2601
02:48:35,667 --> 02:48:38,900
MARISHA: That's true, where was Ripley last seen?
That's probably what I would try to do. I would

2602
02:48:38,900 --> 02:48:40,673
push it that way.

2603
02:48:40,673 --> 02:48:48,019
MATT: Okay, so leaving behind. 25, 30. That's
where you're going to want to leave it, there.

2604
02:48:48,019 --> 02:48:55,678
Currently held up inside that. That sucks for you.
Keyleth, that end your turn?

2605
02:48:55,678 --> 02:48:56,605
MARISHA: Yep.

2606
02:48:56,605 --> 02:49:00,104
TALIESIN: Can he not do anything while he's in
there?

2607
02:49:00,104 --> 02:49:03,072
MARISHA: He's fucked. Yeah. He's stuck in a
tornado.

2608
02:49:03,072 --> 02:49:05,654
LAURA: Unless if it hits Ripley, does she defuse
it?

2609
02:49:05,654 --> 02:49:11,404
MARISHA: She has to save from it. She either gets
sucked up in it or flung, so she's going to get

2610
02:49:11,404 --> 02:49:14,537
fucked either way. I don't know.

2611
02:49:14,537 --> 02:49:16,332
TALIESIN: Well, then we'd know where she is.

2612
02:49:16,332 --> 02:49:19,588
MARISHA: It's not necessarily a spell on her. I
made the spell around her.

2613
02:49:19,588 --> 02:49:20,677
MATT: Keyleth.

2614
02:49:20,677 --> 02:49:22,534
MARISHA: What? No, come on.

2615
02:49:22,534 --> 02:49:27,329
MATT: As you're casting the spell and holding
aloft, the hooded thug, the younger man, runs

2616
02:49:27,329 --> 02:49:29,806
behind and flings a dagger in your direction.

2617
02:49:29,806 --> 02:49:32,006
MARISHA: Kynan? Little shit.

2618
02:49:32,006 --> 02:49:34,452
TALIESIN: She's got cover, by the way.

2619
02:49:34,452 --> 02:49:37,480
MATT: Yeah, you do have half cover on that, which
adds.

2620
02:49:37,480 --> 02:49:40,338
LAURA: No, we can't kill Kynan.

2621
02:49:40,338 --> 02:49:42,175
TRAVIS: <i>You</i> can't kill Kynan.

2622
02:49:42,175 --> 02:49:45,991
SAM: Kill him. Destroy his life.

2623
02:49:45,991 --> 02:49:47,806
LAURA: I can't kill Kynan, and I apparently can't
kill anyone today.

2624
02:49:47,806 --> 02:49:54,835
MATT: Three-quarters cover is plus five. It may
be plus two for half cover. Let me double-check.

2625
02:49:54,835 --> 02:49:58,141
TALIESIN: It's a tree and a bear.

2626
02:49:58,141 --> 02:50:08,771
MATT: I'll say it's three-quarters cover. That's
fine. You get plus five to your AC. 24. What's

2627
02:50:08,771 --> 02:50:09,924
your AC?

2628
02:50:09,924 --> 02:50:11,607
MARISHA: I get plus five?

2629
02:50:11,607 --> 02:50:12,778
MATT: Yeah.

2630
02:50:12,778 --> 02:50:14,297
MARISHA: That hits.

2631
02:50:14,297 --> 02:50:15,568
MATT: That hits, still?

2632
02:50:15,568 --> 02:50:19,404
MARISHA: My armor class is 17 plus five, so that's
22.

2633
02:50:19,404 --> 02:50:25,532
MATT: Yeah, it still hits you. Okay, so, flings
the dagger. This black, curved, razor-like dagger

2634
02:50:25,532 --> 02:50:32,535
sinks into you. Currently no sneak attack damage,
but you do take--

2635
02:50:32,535 --> 02:50:36,532
MARISHA: I swear to god, if he drops me, I'm going
to be so pissed.

2636
02:50:36,532 --> 02:50:41,996
MATT: 16 points of piercing damage to you.

2637
02:50:41,996 --> 02:50:44,432
MARISHA: Okay. All right.

2638
02:50:44,432 --> 02:50:48,608
MATT: I need you to make a concentration check.
Just roll a constitution saving throw.

2639
02:50:48,608 --> 02:50:51,597
MARISHA: What do I have to roll over?

2640
02:50:51,597 --> 02:51:00,657
MATT: It would be ten or higher. Don't roll low.
Constitution saving throw.

2641
02:51:00,657 --> 02:51:02,669
MARISHA: Ten total.

2642
02:51:02,669 --> 02:51:09,636
MATT: You make it! You maintain concentration.
However, as the blade hits you, you watch as it

2643
02:51:09,636 --> 02:51:16,405
was thrown, you notice Kynan shifts into shadow
and goes after the blade, vanishing. The blade

2644
02:51:16,405 --> 02:51:20,431
strikes you, and then suddenly Kynan's hand
appears where the blade stabbed you, and he

2645
02:51:20,431 --> 02:51:21,811
appears next to you.

2646
02:51:21,811 --> 02:51:22,870
TALIESIN: Where?

2647
02:51:22,870 --> 02:51:24,365
MATT: Up on the log, right there.

2648
02:51:24,365 --> 02:51:28,803
MARISHA: Kynan! Hey, man! What's up?

2649
02:51:28,803 --> 02:51:37,742
MATT: You see him shaken. There's sweat on the
face. That ends his turn. It is now the barbarian.

2650
02:51:37,742 --> 02:51:44,065
Not the barbarian, the goliath's turn. There, is
going to attempt to make an athletics check to

2651
02:51:44,065 --> 02:51:51,316
climb. That's enough. Gets up just barely to the
top and that's not going to be enough to really do

2652
02:51:51,316 --> 02:51:55,970
much else on her turn, unfortunately. Messed up
everything she's been trying to do.

2653
02:51:55,970 --> 02:51:58,592
LIAM: Right up the hill, gets kicked back down.

2654
02:51:58,592 --> 02:52:00,402
TRAVIS: She has a shield, right?

2655
02:52:00,402 --> 02:52:08,238
MATT: Yeah, shield. Climbs up, wipes off the blood
from the side of her mouth, (growls). Scanlan,

2656
02:52:08,238 --> 02:52:09,386
you're up.

2657
02:52:09,386 --> 02:52:13,377
SAM: It's a very muddled playing field.

2658
02:52:13,377 --> 02:52:14,537
MATT: Yes, it is.

2659
02:52:14,537 --> 02:52:27,022
SAM: And I'm so far away from everyone. I'm going
to yell: Grog! Hold on to something, man! And so

2660
02:52:27,022 --> 02:52:30,078
I'm going to case Reverse Gravity right there.

2661
02:52:30,078 --> 02:52:31,827
MATT: Oh shit!

2662
02:52:31,827 --> 02:52:34,063
SAM: And get everyone over here.

2663
02:52:34,063 --> 02:52:42,254
MATT: All right, hold on. Reverse Gravity. 100
feet. You could totally get it over there. 50-foot

2664
02:52:42,254 --> 02:52:44,147
radius, so yeah, it's going to get--

2665
02:52:44,147 --> 02:52:47,194
SAM: And Ripley, if she's not immune to it.

2666
02:52:47,194 --> 02:52:50,053
MATT: You can get everyone in that, including
Grog.

2667
02:52:50,053 --> 02:52:53,529
SAM: Sorry, Grog!

2668
02:52:53,529 --> 02:52:59,520
MATT: Grog, make a dexterity saving throw, with
advantage, because it's against a spell.

2669
02:52:59,520 --> 02:53:03,625
TRAVIS: That's not great. That's a six.

2670
02:53:03,625 --> 02:53:05,245
MATT: Nope.

2671
02:53:05,245 --> 02:53:07,975
SAM: You're going on a ride!

2672
02:53:07,975 --> 02:53:19,010
MATT: The gunner fails. The goliath fails.
Interestingly enough, the mage is unaffected

2673
02:53:19,010 --> 02:53:26,021
because he's not affected by gravity. He's
currently being held in a whirlwind. However, go

2674
02:53:26,021 --> 02:53:35,471
ahead and at the full 100 feet high, everyone hits
the very top of it, and then you can choose to

2675
02:53:35,471 --> 02:53:38,313
then either maintain it or drop them immediately.

2676
02:53:38,313 --> 02:53:43,412
SAM: They're gunners, right?

2677
02:53:43,412 --> 02:53:46,246
MATT: There's a gunner there, and then there's the
goliath warrior.

2678
02:53:46,246 --> 02:53:52,820
SAM: I'm going to hold them. I'm going to hold in
place, and let's all go around, find Ripley.

2679
02:53:52,820 --> 02:54:01,820
TALIESIN: You can totally do the Point Break
mid-air combat.

2680
02:54:01,820 --> 02:54:03,190
TRAVIS: At terminal velocity?

2681
02:54:03,190 --> 02:54:09,004
TALIESIN: Isn't Point Break the one where they
keep jumping out of airplanes? I can never

2682
02:54:09,004 --> 02:54:09,849
remember.

2683
02:54:09,849 --> 02:54:11,586
LAURA: Wow, that is so high.

2684
02:54:11,586 --> 02:54:13,175
MARISHA: Hell yeah, man.

2685
02:54:13,175 --> 02:54:15,482
SAM: Sorry!

2686
02:54:15,482 --> 02:54:19,399
TRAVIS: Cool! Super cool, guys! Super cool!

2687
02:54:19,399 --> 02:54:25,378
MATT: They are all currently now (screams) unable
to attack, unable to really do anything well up

2688
02:54:25,378 --> 02:54:27,238
from there.

2689
02:54:27,238 --> 02:54:30,180
LAURA: Just think, if it had been Percy, he would
have thrown up.

2690
02:54:30,180 --> 02:54:37,986
SAM: Other than the mage and maybe Ripley,
everyone's off-- no, and the fucker Kynan.

2691
02:54:37,986 --> 02:54:41,023
MATT: Yeah, he's over there, and there's the
gunner over there.

2692
02:54:41,023 --> 02:54:43,092
SAM: No, that gunner should have been in the
radius.

2693
02:54:43,092 --> 02:54:44,521
MATT: 50-foot radius?

2694
02:54:44,521 --> 02:54:47,032
SAM: 50-foot radius. I cast it right there.

2695
02:54:47,032 --> 02:55:01,223
MATT: Yeah. That would have put-- I'll make a dex
save on them. That is a 21. What is your DC?

2696
02:55:01,223 --> 02:55:02,635
SAM: 21.

2697
02:55:02,635 --> 02:55:07,808
MATT: So just makes it. So it's barely holding on
right now, reaches over and grabs part of the tree

2698
02:55:07,808 --> 02:55:09,390
and is like (groaning).

2699
02:55:09,390 --> 02:55:12,311
TALIESIN: Does that mean he can't fire his gun for
as long as the spell is up?

2700
02:55:12,311 --> 02:55:13,502
MATT: Seemingly, yeah.

2701
02:55:13,502 --> 02:55:14,819
TALIESIN: Good to know.

2702
02:55:14,819 --> 02:55:25,144
TRAVIS: Well, I'm up in the air again. Of all the
people who really shouldn't be in the air, I'm up

2703
02:55:25,144 --> 02:55:27,889
in the air again.

2704
02:55:27,889 --> 02:55:30,602
LAURA: It's like Dragonball Z fighting now.

2705
02:55:30,602 --> 02:55:34,859
MATT: Currently, he's holding on to the branch,
preventing himself from falling upward, grabbing a

2706
02:55:34,859 --> 02:55:40,668
root and part of a tree, and is like (yelling)
stuck there in the moment. Do you want to move?

2707
02:55:40,668 --> 02:55:45,993
SAM: Yes, I'm going to move. Jesus, what's the
fastest way to get across this stupid crevasse?

2708
02:55:45,993 --> 02:55:49,362
Through it?

2709
02:55:49,362 --> 02:55:52,137
MATT: Through it or around. It's up to you.

2710
02:55:52,137 --> 02:55:53,465
LIAM: Get some ouchies in there.

2711
02:55:53,465 --> 02:55:55,809
SAM: It'll take me like, a minute to get all the
way around there.

2712
02:55:55,809 --> 02:55:58,952
LAURA: Can you ride on Bigby's Hand through it?

2713
02:55:58,952 --> 02:56:02,141
MARISHA: Can you Dimension Door?

2714
02:56:02,141 --> 02:56:04,731
SAM: I can't do shit while I'm casting a spell.

2715
02:56:04,731 --> 02:56:06,175
MARISHA: That sucks, man.

2716
02:56:06,175 --> 02:56:10,423
SAM: I'm going to start walking around the
circle.

2717
02:56:10,423 --> 02:56:11,562
MATT: This way?

2718
02:56:11,562 --> 02:56:12,788
SAM: Yeah.

2719
02:56:12,788 --> 02:56:15,575
LAURA: Do you have any healing bonus actions?

2720
02:56:15,575 --> 02:56:17,239
SAM: I do have a healing bonus action.

2721
02:56:17,239 --> 02:56:19,785
LAURA: I'm really low.

2722
02:56:19,785 --> 02:56:23,504
MATT: Five points of piercing damage to you,
Scanlan, as you're running across. Grog's taken

2723
02:56:23,504 --> 02:56:27,934
none because Grog's rage essentially halves the
one point you take per walk, so you don't take any

2724
02:56:27,934 --> 02:56:38,858
damage. Everyone else has been barely moving, so
they've been doing the half move. You take one

2725
02:56:38,858 --> 02:56:40,420
point of damage per square you move.

2726
02:56:40,420 --> 02:56:51,850
SAM: So you're dying? Okay, so I'll turn to Vex
and I'll heal her. I'll sing: (singing) I heal

2727
02:56:51,850 --> 02:57:01,981
you. I heal you so bad. I heal you so bad, it's
driving me mad, it's driving me mad.

2728
02:57:01,981 --> 02:57:05,900
MATT: What level are you casting it as?

2729
02:57:05,900 --> 02:57:07,480
SAM: Two.

2730
02:57:07,480 --> 02:57:09,446
MATT: 2nd-level? Okay, so 2d4 plus six.

2731
02:57:09,446 --> 02:57:15,281
SAM: Ooh! 12.

2732
02:57:15,281 --> 02:57:25,967
MATT: 12 points healed to you, Vex. All right. The
mage, who is currently held in the whirlwind--

2733
02:57:25,967 --> 02:57:28,778
let's see, here.

2734
02:57:28,778 --> 02:57:31,545
TALIESIN: His options are pretty limited, if I
recall.

2735
02:57:31,545 --> 02:57:33,454
LIAM: He diarrheas on himself.

2736
02:57:33,454 --> 02:57:41,213
MATT: He's just restrained. He can still do things
while it's in the whirlwind. It can't move,

2737
02:57:41,213 --> 02:57:42,910
attacks against it have advantage--

2738
02:57:42,910 --> 02:57:45,768
MARISHA: He can just go: oh, Toto!

2739
02:57:45,768 --> 02:57:53,226
ALL: Oh, Toto! Totoro.

2740
02:57:53,226 --> 02:58:01,403
MARISHA: That evolved real quickly. What did we
just do?

2741
02:58:01,403 --> 02:58:03,194
LAURA: I have no idea.

2742
02:58:03,194 --> 02:58:09,847
MATT: Apologies for the delay.

2743
02:58:09,847 --> 02:58:13,386
LAURA: Cool! The dice sticks to the magnets on the
boxes.

2744
02:58:13,386 --> 02:58:14,804
TRAVIS: Oh, the metal ones?

2745
02:58:14,804 --> 02:58:16,275
LIAM: Apropos of nothing.

2746
02:58:16,275 --> 02:58:24,360
MATT: Okay, that works. So the mage, who's
currently held aloft and floating about, looks

2747
02:58:24,360 --> 02:58:30,734
over at the source of the whirlwind, puts a hand
out and goes (grunt). You watch as an arc of

2748
02:58:30,734 --> 02:58:35,740
lightning arcs over in the direction of Keyleth.

2749
02:58:35,740 --> 02:58:37,183
MARISHA: What?

2750
02:58:37,183 --> 02:58:39,903
MATT: It arcs past--

2751
02:58:39,903 --> 02:58:42,524
TALIESIN: Is it going to be able to hit her?

2752
02:58:42,524 --> 02:58:48,103
MARISHA: No fucking shit. He doesn't get thrown?
What a dick.

2753
02:58:48,103 --> 02:58:52,551
MATT: No, the throw is when he breaks free of it.
Right now, he takes damage. Where is it?

2754
02:58:52,551 --> 02:59:06,495
Basically, it just does the damage, and then it
holds him in place. You can basically control

2755
02:59:06,495 --> 02:59:16,609
where they are, which is the fun of it. It's
restrained, and it's held within. Just making sure

2756
02:59:16,609 --> 02:59:21,677
I'm not missing any of the elements here. First
time in a turn that it enters the whirlwind or the

2757
02:59:21,677 --> 02:59:25,299
whirlwind enters its space, including when the
whirlwind first appears. So yeah, it doesn't keep

2758
02:59:25,299 --> 02:59:28,892
taking damage. It is being held aloft right now,
and you can move it over other guys as you

2759
02:59:28,892 --> 02:59:37,318
continue to press through more damage. So anyway,
the arc of lightning arcs over 150-feet distance,

2760
02:59:37,318 --> 02:59:42,146
hitting towards you. I need you to make a
dexterity saving throw, Keyleth.

2761
02:59:42,146 --> 02:59:46,216
MARISHA: Do I have advantage because I'm behind
Trinket or anything? Do I have cover?

2762
02:59:46,216 --> 02:59:47,700
MATT: No, it doesn't help you.

2763
02:59:47,700 --> 02:59:51,265
MARISHA: I have advantage because my armor is
resistant against spells, right?

2764
02:59:51,265 --> 02:59:55,252
MATT: This is true. So go ahead and dexterity
saving throw.

2765
02:59:55,252 --> 03:00:01,775
MARISHA: I'll take that 12. It's not great. 17.

2766
03:00:01,775 --> 03:00:08,692
MATT: Does not help, unfortunately. It's 10d8
lightning damage.

2767
03:00:08,692 --> 03:00:11,690
TALIESIN: There is no way that the guy who's
currently got a knife stuck in her isn't going to

2768
03:00:11,690 --> 03:00:13,137
get some of this.

2769
03:00:13,137 --> 03:00:14,539
MATT: We'll find out in a second.

2770
03:00:14,539 --> 03:00:15,696
TALIESIN: Just asking.

2771
03:00:15,696 --> 03:00:19,185
MARISHA: Honestly, I thought I was going to be
able to last around to the next round.

2772
03:00:19,185 --> 03:00:21,617
TALIESIN: It's okay. There are options.

2773
03:00:21,617 --> 03:00:26,137
MATT: So Keyleth, you take 59 points of lightning
damage.

2774
03:00:26,137 --> 03:00:27,336
LAURA: Oh shit!

2775
03:00:27,336 --> 03:00:28,487
TRAVIS: Fuck!

2776
03:00:28,487 --> 03:00:30,643
MARISHA: (incredulously) I take what?

2777
03:00:30,643 --> 03:00:33,275
MATT: 59 points of lightning damage from the Chain
Lightning spell that just hit you.

2778
03:00:33,275 --> 03:00:38,456
MARISHA: Oh, wow! What kills you in this game?

2779
03:00:38,456 --> 03:00:45,019
LIAM: Hitting zero's unconscious, and then going
past your total HP kills you.

2780
03:00:45,019 --> 03:00:47,148
MARISHA: I have to go past my total HP?

2781
03:00:47,148 --> 03:00:49,889
SAM: Negative 115, or something like that.

2782
03:00:49,889 --> 03:00:52,474
MARISHA: Well I'm negative 58 now.

2783
03:00:52,474 --> 03:00:55,425
LAURA: No, no, no, you're zero now. Now it's just
death saving throws.

2784
03:00:55,425 --> 03:00:58,595
MARISHA: I just go to zero. I don't go negative.

2785
03:00:58,595 --> 03:01:02,399
LIAM: If you don't go higher past your total HP,
you're still at zero.

2786
03:01:02,399 --> 03:01:04,572
LAURA: Take it from us, we've been unconscious a
lot.

2787
03:01:04,572 --> 03:01:06,321
(laughter)

2788
03:01:06,321 --> 03:01:07,440
LAURA: You're fine.

2789
03:01:07,440 --> 03:01:09,012
MARISHA: But do I still have to count going
negative?

2790
03:01:09,012 --> 03:01:10,025
ALL: No.

2791
03:01:10,025 --> 03:01:15,147
MATT: You fall unconscious. The whirlwind vanishes
(thump), and the mage falls prone--

2792
03:01:15,147 --> 03:01:17,066
SAM: Floats 100 feet in the air.

2793
03:01:17,066 --> 03:01:19,470
MARISHA: (thunk) Does he take falling damage?

2794
03:01:19,470 --> 03:01:22,520
MATT: Cannot grab onto anything, because he was
actually lifted up in the air, so the mage is now

2795
03:01:22,520 --> 03:01:23,967
100 feet in the air.

2796
03:01:23,967 --> 03:01:25,137
LAURA: (gasps) Yes!

2797
03:01:25,137 --> 03:01:29,193
MARISHA: Yay, Scanlan! Yeah!

2798
03:01:29,193 --> 03:01:31,251
TALIESIN: That is a series of poor life choices.

2799
03:01:31,251 --> 03:01:32,663
MARISHA: Yeah, it was!

2800
03:01:32,663 --> 03:01:36,374
MATT: However, three bolts then leap from the
target to as many as three other targets. So

2801
03:01:36,374 --> 03:01:37,755
that's going to be--

2802
03:01:37,755 --> 03:01:38,885
SAM: Oh, shit.

2803
03:01:38,885 --> 03:01:39,806
MARISHA: Ooh, jesus christ.

2804
03:01:39,806 --> 03:01:40,908
TALIESIN: Oh, shit.

2805
03:01:40,908 --> 03:01:45,753
MATT: Goes to the first-- that includes Scanlan.
So Scanlan, Percy, and Trinket all get a bolt.

2806
03:01:45,753 --> 03:01:49,798
TALIESIN: (high-pitched) He's not going to get hit
because he's touching her at the time that she

2807
03:01:49,798 --> 03:01:51,099
gets hit?

2808
03:01:51,099 --> 03:01:52,517
LAURA: Yeah, Kynan? Kynan doesn't get hit?

2809
03:01:52,517 --> 03:02:00,063
MATT: He chooses the targets. So I need Percy,
Scanlan, and Trinket to make a dexterity saving throw.

2810
03:02:00,063 --> 03:02:05,626
TALIESIN: Oh, shit. This is about to get very bad.
Oh thank god.

2811
03:02:05,626 --> 03:02:08,236
SAM: Do I get to inspire myself on the save?

2812
03:02:08,236 --> 03:02:10,275
MATT: Not unless you already have inspiration.

2813
03:02:10,275 --> 03:02:11,576
LAURA: (singing) Six.

2814
03:02:11,576 --> 03:02:12,748
SAM: 12.

2815
03:02:12,748 --> 03:02:15,695
LAURA: Oh my god.

2816
03:02:15,695 --> 03:02:17,422
MATT: Let me see here. Make sure if it's an
ability check.

2817
03:02:17,422 --> 03:02:19,107
SAM: Get ready to fall, there, Grog.

2818
03:02:19,107 --> 03:02:20,153
TRAVIS: (laughing) Oh, really?

2819
03:02:20,153 --> 03:02:21,477
TALIESIN: It's about to happen.

2820
03:02:21,477 --> 03:02:22,802
SAM: It's about to happen.

2821
03:02:22,802 --> 03:02:24,106
TRAVIS: (laughing) Oh, man.

2822
03:02:24,106 --> 03:02:28,159
MARISHA: Remember those break-falls you practiced?
Like in basketball in high school? Do that.

2823
03:02:28,159 --> 03:02:30,937
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. From six feet off the ground.

2824
03:02:30,937 --> 03:02:33,426
MATT: Only for an ability check for you,
unfortunately, Scanlan.

2825
03:02:33,426 --> 03:02:34,623
SAM: That's okay.

2826
03:02:34,623 --> 03:02:35,659
TRAVIS: Oh, god.

2827
03:02:35,659 --> 03:02:37,445
LIAM: 8d6 coming your way, papa.

2828
03:02:37,445 --> 03:02:39,052
LAURA: Oh my god. We're going to die.

2829
03:02:39,052 --> 03:02:40,205
SAM: 12.

2830
03:02:40,205 --> 03:02:41,399
TALIESIN: 23.

2831
03:02:41,399 --> 03:02:43,001
MATT: And Trinket?

2832
03:02:43,001 --> 03:02:43,964
LAURA: Six!

2833
03:02:43,964 --> 03:02:45,685
LIAM: Oh, shit.

2834
03:02:45,685 --> 03:02:47,548
MATT: So you took how much damage from that? 59?

2835
03:02:47,548 --> 03:02:48,964
MARISHA: Yeah.

2836
03:02:48,964 --> 03:02:50,675
MATT: 59 points of lightning damage to you.

2837
03:02:50,675 --> 03:02:51,868
SAM: (chokes)

2838
03:02:51,868 --> 03:02:53,346
LAURA: (gasps)

2839
03:02:53,346 --> 03:02:55,270
MATT: Scanlan goes unconscious on the ground.

2840
03:02:55,270 --> 03:02:58,825
MARISHA: Both of your healers are out, bee tee
dubs.

2841
03:02:58,825 --> 03:03:01,030
MATT: Percy, you take 38 points of--

2842
03:03:01,030 --> 03:03:02,383
TALIESIN: 38?

2843
03:03:02,383 --> 03:03:06,623
MATT: It would be-- no, sorry. Half of 59. 28.

2844
03:03:06,623 --> 03:03:08,028
TALIESIN: 28?

2845
03:03:08,028 --> 03:03:09,210
MATT: 29.

2846
03:03:09,210 --> 03:03:10,382
TALIESIN: 29.

2847
03:03:10,382 --> 03:03:12,427
MATT: 29 points of lightning damage to you,
Percy.

2848
03:03:12,427 --> 03:03:14,536
TALIESIN: Hold on, I've got to do some math. Oh my
god.

2849
03:03:14,536 --> 03:03:16,374
MARISHA: Are you out, too? Come on, Percy.

2850
03:03:16,374 --> 03:03:21,721
TALIESIN: No, I'm good. I'm good. Okay, okay.

2851
03:03:21,721 --> 03:03:25,241
MATT: And Trinket takes 59 points of lightning
damage.

2852
03:03:25,241 --> 03:03:26,540
LAURA: Trinket is unconscious.

2853
03:03:26,540 --> 03:03:28,427
TRAVIS: But doesn't he go (whoosh) back to the
pokeball?

2854
03:03:28,427 --> 03:03:30,722
TALIESIN: She has to go over and pick him up.

2855
03:03:30,722 --> 03:03:34,882
LAURA: No, no. If he's unconscious, he goes
straight into my pokeball if I'm within 100 feet.

2856
03:03:34,882 --> 03:03:40,322
MATT: Yeah, (whoosh) so Trinket turns into a
little burst of dark bear shadow and (whoosh)

2857
03:03:40,322 --> 03:03:41,811
shoots into your necklace.

2858
03:03:41,811 --> 03:03:44,642
SAM: And everyone falls.

2859
03:03:44,642 --> 03:03:46,712
MATT: And everyone falls. (laughs)

2860
03:03:46,712 --> 03:03:48,289
TRAVIS: No, no, no. Why?

2861
03:03:48,289 --> 03:03:50,366
LAURA: Yeah, because Scanlan went unconscious.

2862
03:03:50,366 --> 03:03:52,099
MARISHA: Me and you, man. We're out.

2863
03:03:52,099 --> 03:03:53,610
LIAM: Concentration's gone.

2864
03:03:53,610 --> 03:03:56,602
Everybody wake up!

2865
03:03:56,602 --> 03:03:57,940
MARISHA: Yeah. Wha-bam!

2866
03:03:57,940 --> 03:04:01,910
TRAVIS: Like, some Looney Tunes shit? (pew) And
the head just stays there, and then (rushing wind).

2867
03:04:01,910 --> 03:04:05,538
MARISHA: Everyone looks down for a second and
processes?

2868
03:04:05,538 --> 03:04:07,931
LIAM: Sorry, Wile E.

2869
03:04:07,931 --> 03:04:10,703
MATT: That is 30 points of bludgeoning damage.

2870
03:04:10,703 --> 03:04:11,933
TRAVIS: On the fall?

2871
03:04:11,933 --> 03:04:13,531
MATT: Yeah, you take half.

2872
03:04:13,531 --> 03:04:14,542
TRAVIS: Half?

2873
03:04:14,542 --> 03:04:16,657
MATT: Because you can still maintain your rage
while up there, so you take 15.

2874
03:04:16,657 --> 03:04:17,831
TRAVIS: Persistent rage, baby.

2875
03:04:17,831 --> 03:04:18,956
MATT: Exactly.

2876
03:04:18,956 --> 03:04:21,520
TRAVIS: It's a new feat.

2877
03:04:21,520 --> 03:04:28,525
MATT: The gunner splats. Just a messy splat of red
crimson on the ground.

2878
03:04:28,525 --> 03:04:37,034
LAURA: Good, that's good. Evening out the odds as
we all go unconscious, they all go unconscious.

2879
03:04:37,034 --> 03:04:41,239
MATT: Impacts, is alive but hurt, and is like
(pain grunt) on the ground.

2880
03:04:41,239 --> 03:04:44,259
LAURA: Does she fall into the 20-foot crevasse?

2881
03:04:44,259 --> 03:04:45,822
MATT: Yes, and then takes an additional--

2882
03:04:45,822 --> 03:04:48,328
TRAVIS: Do it. End her. Finish her off.

2883
03:04:48,328 --> 03:04:51,653
MARISHA: Come on. Die, die, die. Die.

2884
03:04:51,653 --> 03:04:56,039
MATT: Actually, let's see if she manages to make a
saving throw to stay there. She actually lands on

2885
03:04:56,039 --> 03:05:00,173
the edge, because that's where she was standing
before. Nope! Not with a five. So that's an

2886
03:05:00,173 --> 03:05:10,828
additional 13 points of damage. Oh, she's looking
rough. But that other gunner is gone. That guy's

2887
03:05:10,828 --> 03:05:14,060
fine who's been holding on. The mage takes--

2888
03:05:14,060 --> 03:05:16,570
TALIESIN: It's already taken some hits.

2889
03:05:16,570 --> 03:05:19,584
MATT: The mage splats.

2890
03:05:19,584 --> 03:05:21,728
MARISHA: Yeah, he does! Fuck you.

2891
03:05:21,728 --> 03:05:23,125
SAM: I killed two people!

2892
03:05:23,125 --> 03:05:24,641
TALIESIN: With your eyes closed!

2893
03:05:24,641 --> 03:05:26,556
MATT: Grog, you are prone on the ground there.

2894
03:05:26,556 --> 03:05:31,379
LAURA: How many points did you take? That's it?
Just 15 points? That's it?

2895
03:05:31,379 --> 03:05:33,015
TALIESIN: He is made of stone.

2896
03:05:33,015 --> 03:05:35,209
TRAVIS: That hurt me. My hit points are actually
in the double digits now.

2897
03:05:35,209 --> 03:05:37,012
LAURA: Oh, you poor thing!

2898
03:05:37,012 --> 03:05:38,281
SAM: Oh, wow. That's rare.

2899
03:05:38,281 --> 03:05:39,968
TRAVIS: I know. I'm a little frightened.

2900
03:05:39,968 --> 03:05:41,533
SAM: Upper 90s.

2901
03:05:41,533 --> 03:05:43,528
TALIESIN: Mine are almost in the singles.

2902
03:05:43,528 --> 03:05:44,991
LAURA: He's still like almost a hundred hit
points.

2903
03:05:44,991 --> 03:05:46,162
MATT: Percival, it's your turn.

2904
03:05:46,162 --> 03:05:48,547
SAM: Start healing everyone.

2905
03:05:48,547 --> 03:05:51,199
MARISHA: Fucking shit.

2906
03:05:51,199 --> 03:05:56,924
TALIESIN: Okay. First thing I'm going to do is,
I'm going to--

2907
03:05:56,924 --> 03:06:06,207
SAM: (singing) Heal the world. Make it a better
place.

2908
03:06:06,207 --> 03:06:10,926
TALIESIN: This is such a bad experience on every
conceivable level. First thing I'm going to do is

2909
03:06:10,926 --> 03:06:18,200
I'm going to run up to that jerk with the knives
and I am going to press my left hand with great

2910
03:06:18,200 --> 03:06:23,380
authority, especially considering I've just taken
another bolt of intense electricity, and I am

2911
03:06:23,380 --> 03:06:30,175
going to Iron Man the living-- on the head. I'm
going to just do it.

2912
03:06:30,175 --> 03:06:31,389
MATT: Go for it.

2913
03:06:31,389 --> 03:06:33,114
TALIESIN: I am going to use Diplomacy for the
first--

2914
03:06:33,114 --> 03:06:34,569
SAM: Have you ever used Diplomacy?

2915
03:06:34,569 --> 03:06:36,411
TALIESIN: This is the second time we have ever
used Diplomacy.

2916
03:06:36,411 --> 03:06:37,993
MATT: Yeah, go ahead and roll for an attack.

2917
03:06:37,993 --> 03:06:42,131
TALIESIN: I actually have no idea how to roll for
an attack for this. I have no idea how it works,

2918
03:06:42,131 --> 03:06:45,643
so I can roll and tell you what I roll.

2919
03:06:45,643 --> 03:06:49,866
MATT: No, roll a d20. You add your proficiency
bonus of five, plus your strength modifier.

2920
03:06:49,866 --> 03:06:52,267
TALIESIN: That's embarrassing. Okay.

2921
03:06:52,267 --> 03:06:53,613
MATT: I know.

2922
03:06:53,613 --> 03:06:55,697
LAURA: That's okay. You'll roll a natural 20
anyway.

2923
03:06:55,697 --> 03:06:57,052
MATT: You know what, for the, hmm--

2924
03:06:57,052 --> 03:06:58,687
TALIESIN: I just rolled.

2925
03:06:58,687 --> 03:07:00,035
SAM: He'll be okay, he'll be okay.

2926
03:07:00,035 --> 03:07:03,259
TALIESIN: And unless you've got something to add
to that, because that is a sad number that you

2927
03:07:03,259 --> 03:07:04,775
just threw at me.

2928
03:07:04,775 --> 03:07:07,379
SAM: That's fine. You'll be fine. You'll be fine.

2929
03:07:07,379 --> 03:07:11,695
MATT: I would say, unfortunately, because you're
not a monk, it's going to be strength. It's for

2930
03:07:11,695 --> 03:07:13,402
every physical impact.

2931
03:07:13,402 --> 03:07:16,629
TALIESIN: Okay, because it's touch. I don't
actually have to put any--

2932
03:07:16,629 --> 03:07:18,135
TRAVIS: What is it?

2933
03:07:18,135 --> 03:07:19,180
LIAM: What'd you roll?

2934
03:07:19,180 --> 03:07:22,882
TALIESIN: It's a 22 is what I rolled.

2935
03:07:22,882 --> 03:07:24,287
TRAVIS: What are you even worried about?

2936
03:07:24,287 --> 03:07:25,390
LAURA: How is that sad?

2937
03:07:25,390 --> 03:07:26,418
MATT: You hit.

2938
03:07:26,418 --> 03:07:27,574
TALIESIN: I am horrified by what's going on.

2939
03:07:27,574 --> 03:07:29,438
LAURA: You're touching him. How can you not hit?

2940
03:07:29,438 --> 03:07:30,653
MATT: What'd you roll?

2941
03:07:30,653 --> 03:07:31,695
TALIESIN: 16.

2942
03:07:31,695 --> 03:07:32,773
MATT: Yeah, you're fine.

2943
03:07:32,773 --> 03:07:33,998
TALIESIN: But my strength is a one, so I'm
horrified.

2944
03:07:33,998 --> 03:07:35,287
MATT: Yeah. But you do actually strike.

2945
03:07:35,287 --> 03:07:36,647
TALIESIN: Okay. Oh, god.

2946
03:07:36,647 --> 03:07:40,830
MATT: So he's going to go ahead and make a
constitution saving throw. Natural one.

2947
03:07:40,830 --> 03:07:41,995
TRAVIS: Yeah!

2948
03:07:41,995 --> 03:07:44,700
MATT: Although I love when the dice make narrative
work.

2949
03:07:44,700 --> 03:07:47,034
SAM: Kynan going to die.

2950
03:07:47,034 --> 03:07:53,384
MATT: So go ahead and roll. With a lightning
charge earlier, any additional charge?

2951
03:07:53,384 --> 03:07:56,778
TALIESIN: Technically, if it's one long rest, I
may be at three charges. Two or three charges.

2952
03:07:56,778 --> 03:07:58,082
MATT: So 3d6.

2953
03:07:58,082 --> 03:07:59,650
TALIESIN: Okay, that'll do.

2954
03:07:59,650 --> 03:08:06,429
LAURA: (quietly) Your girlfriend's on the ground
unconscious, and you're worried about some

2955
03:08:06,429 --> 03:08:07,537
little--

2956
03:08:07,537 --> 03:08:08,532
LIAM: Shush!

2957
03:08:08,532 --> 03:08:09,680
TALIESIN: Ten points.

2958
03:08:09,680 --> 03:08:10,652
LIAM: I'm there, you're there.

2959
03:08:10,652 --> 03:08:11,802
MATT: Ten points. All righty.

2960
03:08:11,802 --> 03:08:13,275
LIAM: 80 feet apart.

2961
03:08:13,275 --> 03:08:14,885
MATT: Ten points of damage to Kynan.

2962
03:08:14,885 --> 03:08:16,066
LAURA: Your girlfriend's on the ground.

2963
03:08:16,066 --> 03:08:17,227
LIAM: It's not your turn!

2964
03:08:17,227 --> 03:08:19,449
MATT: And Kynan is stunned for the round.

2965
03:08:19,449 --> 03:08:21,122
LIAM: If you want to save her on your action, go
for it.

2966
03:08:21,122 --> 03:08:22,826
MATT: I also need you to roll another d20.

2967
03:08:22,826 --> 03:08:24,791
TALIESIN: Oh, for that?

2968
03:08:24,791 --> 03:08:26,493
MATT: Just roll another d20.

2969
03:08:26,493 --> 03:08:28,269
TALIESIN: 11.

2970
03:08:28,269 --> 03:08:33,515
MATT: 11? Okay. Diplomacy shorts out and is
probably going to need to be repaired.

2971
03:08:33,515 --> 03:08:37,704
TALIESIN: That's fine. He's stunned?

2972
03:08:37,704 --> 03:08:41,342
MATT: He's like (grunt). The electricity hit. He's
currently shocked. He's going to be stunned-- he

2973
03:08:41,342 --> 03:08:42,775
can't do anything for the next round.

2974
03:08:42,775 --> 03:08:47,239
TALIESIN: Okay. Am I close enough-- in theory, I
wanted to be touching distance to Keyleth?

2975
03:08:47,239 --> 03:08:48,874
MATT: Yes, you are.

2976
03:08:48,874 --> 03:08:50,949
TALIESIN: Can I use a bonus to feed her a potion,
or is that a full action?

2977
03:08:50,949 --> 03:08:53,217
MATT: To feed somebody a potion? That's a full
action.

2978
03:08:53,217 --> 03:08:54,670
TALIESIN: (high voice) All right, next round.

2979
03:08:54,670 --> 03:08:57,904
MATT: Yourself is a bonus. But that requires you
to pull it out, grab someone, open their mouth,

2980
03:08:57,904 --> 03:09:00,890
pull off the cork, pour it down, and make sure
they swallow it.

2981
03:09:00,890 --> 03:09:06,774
TALIESIN: Okay, that's fine. For the rest of my
action, I'm going to, after that, two slashes with

2982
03:09:06,774 --> 03:09:09,138
the sword to finish it up, and then hop down.

2983
03:09:09,138 --> 03:09:10,878
MATT: Go for it. Go for it.

2984
03:09:10,878 --> 03:09:13,199
TALIESIN: Do I have advantage because he's fucked
at the moment?

2985
03:09:13,199 --> 03:09:15,847
MATT: Oh yeah, no. He is stunned, so attacks have
advantage.

2986
03:09:15,847 --> 03:09:18,285
TALIESIN: Okay, so let's do two little slashes.

2987
03:09:18,285 --> 03:09:20,199
MATT: Technically, it's incapacitated--

2988
03:09:20,199 --> 03:09:21,332
TALIESIN: Natural 20!

2989
03:09:21,332 --> 03:09:22,649
MATT: Well they're both crits.

2990
03:09:22,649 --> 03:09:23,625
TALIESIN: Oh.

2991
03:09:23,625 --> 03:09:24,762
MARISHA: Because he's stunned?

2992
03:09:24,762 --> 03:09:25,819
TALIESIN: Because he's stunned.

2993
03:09:25,819 --> 03:09:27,096
MATT: Yeah, because they're melee.

2994
03:09:27,096 --> 03:09:28,814
TALIESIN: Oh, and so I'm going to roll crit
damage. That's funny.

2995
03:09:28,814 --> 03:09:30,248
MARISHA: Wait, are you whaling on this kid?

2996
03:09:30,248 --> 03:09:35,453
TALIESIN: I'm going to whale on this fucking kid,
because no, we do not have time for niceties. So

2997
03:09:35,453 --> 03:09:36,957
that's 4d8.

2998
03:09:36,957 --> 03:09:40,586
TRAVIS: Try and leave something that resembles
baby food.

2999
03:09:40,586 --> 03:09:42,246
TALIESIN: Maybe. (counting)

3000
03:09:42,246 --> 03:09:50,122
MATT: Double dice, then add bonus.

3001
03:09:50,122 --> 03:09:52,014
TALIESIN: Yeah. 34 points of damage.

3002
03:09:52,014 --> 03:09:53,298
MATT: 34 on the first strike?

3003
03:09:53,298 --> 03:09:54,284
TALIESIN: No, that's 34 total.

3004
03:09:54,284 --> 03:09:59,915
MATT: Total? Okay. 34 points of damage. As you
(swish) and start carving up the currently

3005
03:09:59,915 --> 03:10:06,036
paralyzed man, the armor separating with each
slash, the red crimson beginning to pour from the

3006
03:10:06,036 --> 03:10:08,600
wounds, the eyes are quivering in fear.

3007
03:10:08,600 --> 03:10:14,292
TALIESIN: I'm going to then hop down next to her
and on that side of her so that I can deal with that.

3008
03:10:14,292 --> 03:10:15,376
MATT: Okay.

3009
03:10:15,376 --> 03:10:16,277
TALIESIN: Thank you.

3010
03:10:16,277 --> 03:10:17,508
MATT: Ends Percy's turn. Grog, you're up.

3011
03:10:17,508 --> 03:10:18,649
TRAVIS: Can I stand up, please?

3012
03:10:18,649 --> 03:10:22,116
MATT: Yep. You still have 25 feet of movement if
you want it.

3013
03:10:22,116 --> 03:10:25,045
TRAVIS: Oh, shit. Who's down in the crevasse down
there?

3014
03:10:25,045 --> 03:10:26,117
MATT: That's the goliath.

3015
03:10:26,117 --> 03:10:27,462
TRAVIS: Who's the other one in the crevasse?

3016
03:10:27,462 --> 03:10:28,934
MATT: That is Vax'ildan.

3017
03:10:28,934 --> 03:10:31,959
TRAVIS: Oh. Can I slide down to the goliath?

3018
03:10:31,959 --> 03:10:33,320
MATT: You can.

3019
03:10:33,320 --> 03:10:36,700
TRAVIS: (rock slide noise) Six points of damage?

3020
03:10:36,700 --> 03:10:45,189
MATT: If you slide down to meet her, with that
kind of force, you will take seven points of

3021
03:10:45,189 --> 03:10:46,698
piercing damage reduced to three.

3022
03:10:46,698 --> 03:10:47,695
TRAVIS: Okay.

3023
03:10:47,695 --> 03:10:50,583
MATT: So that's three points of piercing damage.
You (sliding noise) down to the bottom.

3024
03:10:50,583 --> 03:10:52,211
TRAVIS: Can I make-- is she prone?

3025
03:10:52,211 --> 03:10:53,445
MATT: She is prone, yes.

3026
03:10:53,445 --> 03:10:54,907
TRAVIS: Do I get advantage on that anyway, then?

3027
03:10:54,907 --> 03:10:55,950
MATT: You do.

3028
03:10:55,950 --> 03:10:57,900
TRAVIS: Can I make it great weapon master,
please?

3029
03:10:57,900 --> 03:10:59,649
MATT: You may.

3030
03:10:59,649 --> 03:11:09,116
TRAVIS: Thank you. (quietly) I won't need it.
That's even better. (counting) 32. No, minus five.

3031
03:11:09,116 --> 03:11:11,247
28.

3032
03:11:11,247 --> 03:11:12,445
MATT: 28.

3033
03:11:12,445 --> 03:11:15,810
TALIESIN: Can I pop in a bonus action? I meant to
take a potion anyway.

3034
03:11:15,810 --> 03:11:17,632
SAM: For himself.

3035
03:11:17,632 --> 03:11:18,650
TALIESIN: For myself.

3036
03:11:18,650 --> 03:11:19,407
MATT: Sure.

3037
03:11:19,407 --> 03:11:20,658
TALIESIN: Thank you. What's a regular at?

3038
03:11:20,658 --> 03:11:25,124
MATT: Regular is 1d4 plus-- no, 2d4 plus two.
Sorry.

3039
03:11:25,124 --> 03:11:26,828
TALIESIN: Thank you.

3040
03:11:26,828 --> 03:11:28,088
MATT: So Grog.

3041
03:11:28,088 --> 03:11:34,746
TRAVIS: 32 points of damage on the first one with
the great weapon master, five of which is

3042
03:11:34,746 --> 03:11:37,232
necrotic. 32 on the first one.

3043
03:11:37,232 --> 03:11:38,301
MATT: Yep.

3044
03:11:38,301 --> 03:11:40,691
SAM: That goliath is dead.

3045
03:11:40,691 --> 03:11:46,006
TRAVIS: (chuckles) Yeah. That's a 28-- uh, 23.

3046
03:11:46,006 --> 03:11:53,156
MATT: You slam that axe down once into her chest.
She (pained yell) gives out air and grabs the

3047
03:11:53,156 --> 03:11:57,434
blade to try and pull it out from the wound. You
put your boot down on her face and push her away,

3048
03:11:57,434 --> 03:11:59,602
pull the axe up. How do you want to finish her
off?

3049
03:11:59,602 --> 03:12:00,702
MARISHA: Ooh!

3050
03:12:00,702 --> 03:12:01,858
MATT: How do you want to do this?

3051
03:12:01,858 --> 03:12:06,696
TRAVIS: Man, doesn't it suck when you don't even
get one fucking hit in on this fight?

3052
03:12:06,696 --> 03:12:09,263
(laughter, groans)

3053
03:12:09,263 --> 03:12:12,992
TRAVIS: And I'm going to bring it down clean on
the forehead because I would like to see what her

3054
03:12:12,992 --> 03:12:14,237
brain looks like.

3055
03:12:14,237 --> 03:12:15,696
(noises of disgust)

3056
03:12:15,696 --> 03:12:21,894
MATT: (slash sound) It's purplish and gray. Given
the force of the impact and the scattering of the

3057
03:12:21,894 --> 03:12:27,338
top of the head against the stone and glass, yeah,
she is no more. The body goes limp, and as you

3058
03:12:27,338 --> 03:12:31,185
realize, your foot on her pushing her down, you're
actually pushing the glass shards through her body

3059
03:12:31,185 --> 03:12:35,514
that are underneath her, and you see them begin
to pierce through her armor plating.

3060
03:12:35,514 --> 03:12:37,717
TRAVIS: I'll give her a little extra (grunt)
shove.

3061
03:12:37,717 --> 03:12:38,987
MATT: (slash) There you go.

3062
03:12:38,987 --> 03:12:42,815
TRAVIS: I have one extra attack, but I will--

3063
03:12:42,815 --> 03:12:45,144
LAURA: Ooh, can you get-- oh no, that's too far
away.

3064
03:12:45,144 --> 03:12:52,382
TRAVIS: Nah. You know what, I'm good-- no, 25
feet. I probably can't climb out of there, right?

3065
03:12:52,382 --> 03:12:58,682
MATT: Slid down there. I could give you an
athletics check to try and climb out, but you will

3066
03:12:58,682 --> 03:13:00,240
just barely get out. You won't get your full
movement.

3067
03:13:00,240 --> 03:13:01,668
TRAVIS: Let's try it.

3068
03:13:01,668 --> 03:13:04,163
MATT: With advantage, because you're raging.

3069
03:13:04,239 --> 03:13:06,700
TALIESIN: I'm having a heart attack right now.

3070
03:13:06,700 --> 03:13:07,851
TRAVIS: 20.

3071
03:13:07,851 --> 03:13:09,109
MATT: You rage-climb to the edge.

3072
03:13:09,109 --> 03:13:10,034
SAM: Rage-climb!

3073
03:13:10,034 --> 03:13:13,365
TRAVIS: (snarling, growling, breathing heavily)

3074
03:13:13,365 --> 03:13:15,662
MATT: End of your turn?

3075
03:13:15,662 --> 03:13:16,703
TRAVIS: That's it.

3076
03:13:16,703 --> 03:13:24,385
MATT: All righty. Reverse Gravity fucked up
everything a little.

3077
03:13:24,385 --> 03:13:25,894
TRAVIS: Yeah, it did.

3078
03:13:25,894 --> 03:13:27,238
MARISHA: I'm not going to die to this bitch.

3079
03:13:27,238 --> 03:13:28,291
TALIESIN: Nope.

3080
03:13:28,291 --> 03:13:33,044
SAM: That goliath went on quite the ride. Down the
crevasse, up 100 feet, down, down again.

3081
03:13:33,044 --> 03:13:34,395
TALIESIN: She should write a book.

3082
03:13:34,395 --> 03:13:37,734
MATT: Ripley appears at the edge of the crevasse.
She glances about and sees the state of her party

3083
03:13:37,734 --> 03:13:49,210
and goes (groans) and then peers off in your
direction. All right. She is going to go ahead and--

3084
03:13:49,210 --> 03:13:51,633
TALIESIN: She's got a broken gun right now.

3085
03:13:51,633 --> 03:13:55,062
MATT: Well, she can take a bonus action to go
ahead and attempt to repair it.

3086
03:13:55,062 --> 03:13:58,383
TALIESIN: Can she repair on a bonus?

3087
03:13:58,383 --> 03:14:00,517
LIAM: DM says what?

3088
03:14:00,517 --> 03:14:02,888
MATT: Well, no. For this, this would be--

3089
03:14:02,888 --> 03:14:04,318
TALIESIN: It's an action. It's a full action to
repair.

3090
03:14:04,318 --> 03:14:05,405
MATT: --an action to do it, yeah.

3091
03:14:05,405 --> 03:14:06,447
TALIESIN: An action to repair.

3092
03:14:06,447 --> 03:14:07,217
MATT: That's true.

3093
03:14:07,217 --> 03:14:08,194
TALIESIN: Ha!

3094
03:14:08,194 --> 03:14:10,066
(laughter)

3095
03:14:10,066 --> 03:14:11,424
MATT: That's a success. So she repairs it with her
action.

3096
03:14:11,424 --> 03:14:13,819
TALIESIN: But she can't fire unless she has a--

3097
03:14:13,819 --> 03:14:15,991
MATT: An action surge?

3098
03:14:15,991 --> 03:14:19,331
TALIESIN: Fuck! I shouldn't have even said my god
damn-- god damn it!

3099
03:14:19,331 --> 03:14:20,684
MATT: Oh no, it's on the list. Don't worry.

3100
03:14:20,684 --> 03:14:26,730
TALIESIN: All right. This is meant to punish me
for everything I've ever done. I'm well aware that

3101
03:14:26,730 --> 03:14:27,882
this is punishment.

3102
03:14:27,882 --> 03:14:31,508
MATT: The first strike, she has two more grit
points. She's going to spend one to do a violent

3103
03:14:31,508 --> 03:14:32,691
shot on you.

3104
03:14:32,691 --> 03:14:33,986
TALIESIN: God damn it.

3105
03:14:33,986 --> 03:14:38,766
MATT: That is a 25? 25.

3106
03:14:38,766 --> 03:14:40,196
TALIESIN: That's a 25?

3107
03:14:40,196 --> 03:14:41,874
MATT: 25, yeah. It wasn't a very high roll.

3108
03:14:41,874 --> 03:14:43,253
LAURA: Are you still ducking behind the tree?

3109
03:14:43,253 --> 03:14:45,709
TALIESIN: I am still ducking behind the tree, but
that still hits.

3110
03:14:45,709 --> 03:14:49,885
MATT: All right, so that's a violent shot on that.
She's going to spend another grit point to do--

3111
03:14:49,885 --> 03:14:57,665
well, let's do that attack first. So that is 2d10.
(counting)

3112
03:14:57,665 --> 03:15:02,968
SAM: Oh, boy.

3113
03:15:02,968 --> 03:15:08,277
TALIESIN: That's too much math happening over
here.

3114
03:15:08,277 --> 03:15:09,942
MATT: 25 points.

3115
03:15:09,942 --> 03:15:10,969
TALIESIN: How many?

3116
03:15:10,969 --> 03:15:15,783
MATT: 25 points of piercing damage with two points
psychic.

3117
03:15:15,783 --> 03:15:19,130
TALIESIN: 25 points of piercing damage? I'm going
to have to try and catch that because it's going

3118
03:15:19,130 --> 03:15:23,101
to fucking knock me out, so I'm going to attempt
to snare that bullet.

3119
03:15:23,101 --> 03:15:24,880
MATT: How often can you snare ranged stuff?

3120
03:15:24,880 --> 03:15:26,801
TALIESIN: It snares all ranged.

3121
03:15:26,801 --> 03:15:28,693
MATT: No, but I'm trying to see how many times you
can use that.

3122
03:15:28,693 --> 03:15:30,806
TALIESIN: I can do it once a round.

3123
03:15:30,806 --> 03:15:31,855
MATT: Every turn as a reaction?

3124
03:15:31,855 --> 03:15:32,914
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's a reaction.

3125
03:15:32,914 --> 03:15:35,706
MATT: That's pretty cool. All right, go for it.
Just want to make sure.

3126
03:15:35,706 --> 03:15:42,084
TALIESIN: (groan of frustration) I snare eight
points of damage off of that, so that's-- how many

3127
03:15:42,084 --> 03:15:43,026
points is that?

3128
03:15:43,026 --> 03:15:46,866
MATT: So it was 25 plus two, 27, so 19.

3129
03:15:46,866 --> 03:15:49,175
MARISHA: You're still alive. It was enough to keep
you al-- oh my god, man!

3130
03:15:49,175 --> 03:15:50,346
LAURA: Is he still alive?

3131
03:15:50,346 --> 03:15:51,303
SAM: (whispering) One point!

3132
03:15:51,303 --> 03:15:53,307
LAURA: Oh, jeez! Oh my god!

3133
03:15:53,307 --> 03:15:54,981
TRAVIS: Now you're doing the one-eyed
blinky-wink.

3134
03:15:54,981 --> 03:15:57,136
MATT: Plus two points of necrotic damage from
Hex.

3135
03:15:57,136 --> 03:15:58,496
MARISHA: No, no, no!

3136
03:15:58,496 --> 03:16:02,748
SAM: (poink, power down sound)

3137
03:16:02,748 --> 03:16:04,354
TALIESIN: I'm not going to fall. Wait, uh.

3138
03:16:04,354 --> 03:16:07,235
MARISHA: I spent a 6th-level spell to keep you
alive, man!

3139
03:16:07,235 --> 03:16:08,524
MATT: What are you at?

3140
03:16:08,524 --> 03:16:12,628
TALIESIN: Necklace?

3141
03:16:12,628 --> 03:16:22,055
MATT: For this, you are unconscious. Let me see
this real fast.

3142
03:16:22,055 --> 03:16:23,608
TALIESIN: Okay.

3143
03:16:23,608 --> 03:16:25,879
MATT: You'll see if it has a perk.

3144
03:16:25,879 --> 03:16:29,243
TALIESIN: I'm happy either way. Shit.

3145
03:16:29,243 --> 03:16:31,945
MATT: No, that does not affect you at this time.

3146
03:16:31,945 --> 03:16:34,211
TALIESIN: Okay, just checking. That's fine. Shit.
Okay.

3147
03:16:34,211 --> 03:16:35,749
TRAVIS: You taking a knee?

3148
03:16:35,749 --> 03:16:40,344
MATT: Okay. So are you unconscious?

3149
03:16:40,344 --> 03:16:41,452
TALIESIN: I am unconscious.

3150
03:16:41,452 --> 03:16:42,473
LAURA: (quietly) Oh my god.

3151
03:16:42,473 --> 03:16:48,857
MATT: You hit the ground. As you fall, the shadow
around Ripley flares and you hear a voice go,

3152
03:16:48,857 --> 03:16:53,061
"Yes!" She aims and takes another shot at you.

3153
03:16:53,061 --> 03:16:54,123
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

3154
03:16:54,123 --> 03:16:55,240
LAURA: (gasps)

3155
03:16:55,240 --> 03:16:56,307
TRAVIS: Shit, that's hard.

3156
03:16:56,307 --> 03:16:58,504
MATT: Yeah, that hits. You lose a death saving
throw.

3157
03:16:58,504 --> 03:16:59,549
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

3158
03:16:59,549 --> 03:17:03,226
MATT: Third shot at you. Second death saving
throw.

3159
03:17:03,226 --> 03:17:04,407
TALIESIN: Okay.

3160
03:17:04,407 --> 03:17:11,059
SAM: (muffled, laughing) Oh my god.

3161
03:17:11,059 --> 03:17:21,492
MATT: She shouts over her shoulder, "Finish him!"
And... she doesn't vanish. There's a shimmer, and

3162
03:17:21,492 --> 03:17:31,322
she goes, "Ugh! Curses!" And runs (counting) 30
that way. Actually, not quite. Right there. She

3163
03:17:31,322 --> 03:17:37,646
shouts over her shoulder, "Finish him!" This one
over here, looking over to the side, goes and

3164
03:17:37,646 --> 03:17:38,847
takes aim.

3165
03:17:38,847 --> 03:17:40,055
TALIESIN: Is it his turn next?

3166
03:17:40,055 --> 03:17:42,507
MATT: Yeah. The gunners go next.

3167
03:17:42,507 --> 03:17:46,878
TALIESIN: God damn it. Take it. Currently, I do
have some AC because I have some cover.

3168
03:17:46,878 --> 03:17:49,928
MATT: Correct, and technically it is--

3169
03:17:49,928 --> 03:17:55,009
TALIESIN: I don't know why I'm arguing with this,
because I'm amused by this entire process at the

3170
03:17:55,009 --> 03:17:55,981
moment.

3171
03:17:55,981 --> 03:18:04,863
MATT: This is with the pistol. (gunshot) Takes a
shot. The third bullet (rushing bullet) sinks into

3172
03:18:04,863 --> 03:18:11,845
Percy's form, and the breath fades to stillness.
The necklace (breaking glass) shatters around your

3173
03:18:11,845 --> 03:18:17,659
neck, the one that Pike gave you, and a sudden
burst of divine energy fills your body, and you're

3174
03:18:17,659 --> 03:18:18,942
restored to one hit point.

3175
03:18:18,942 --> 03:18:22,058
(gasping and exclaiming)

3176
03:18:22,058 --> 03:18:23,644
TRAVIS: Are you serious?

3177
03:18:23,644 --> 03:18:26,050
LAURA: Pike, saving the day when she's not even
here!

3178
03:18:26,050 --> 03:18:27,720
MARISHA: She's not even here!

3179
03:18:27,720 --> 03:18:28,815
SAM: What?!

3180
03:18:28,815 --> 03:18:30,722
TRAVIS: Dude, that was <i>it</i>! That was--

3181
03:18:30,722 --> 03:18:32,408
MARISHA: When did she fucking give you that, man?

3182
03:18:32,408 --> 03:18:33,842
LAURA: Before she left! Before she left.

3183
03:18:33,842 --> 03:18:35,201
MATT: She pulled it from under her bed.

3184
03:18:35,201 --> 03:18:38,192
TRAVIS: All I'm hearing is Jon Bon Jovi Living On
A Prayer.

3185
03:18:38,192 --> 03:18:41,488
(laughter)

3186
03:18:41,488 --> 03:18:42,995
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

3187
03:18:42,995 --> 03:18:49,127
SAM: Fucking what? You just died, motherfucker!

3188
03:18:49,127 --> 03:18:54,364
MATT: And yeah, that's going to go ahead and end the
gunner's turn. Vex, you're up.

3189
03:18:54,369 --> 03:18:59,142
LIAM: Kill, Grog. Kill, Grog.

3190
03:18:59,142 --> 03:19:01,051
TRAVIS: I'm so far away.

3191
03:19:01,051 --> 03:19:07,554
LAURA: Where was Scanlan on the initiative order?
Is he before me, or would he go after me?

3192
03:19:07,554 --> 03:19:09,407
MATT: Scanlan goes far after you.

3193
03:19:09,407 --> 03:19:15,884
LAURA: I'm going to run up to Scanlan, and I'm
going to cast Cure fucking Wounds with my shit-ass

3194
03:19:15,884 --> 03:19:20,145
healing at level four. So that's 4d8 plus four.

3195
03:19:20,145 --> 03:19:22,690
SAM: (incredulously) 4d8 plus four?

3196
03:19:22,690 --> 03:19:23,575
LAURA: Yeah.

3197
03:19:23,575 --> 03:19:24,888
SAM: That's a significant spell.

3198
03:19:24,888 --> 03:19:27,601
LAURA: That's not bad.

3199
03:19:27,601 --> 03:19:31,600
TALIESIN: My grit doesn't restore from-- none of
my stuff restores from death, does it?

3200
03:19:31,600 --> 03:19:33,268
LIAM: Oh, stop asking for anything.

3201
03:19:33,268 --> 03:19:35,507
TALIESIN: I am desperate, because we are still so
fucked!

3202
03:19:35,507 --> 03:19:37,773
LAURA: 28 hit points.

3203
03:19:37,773 --> 03:19:39,412
SAM: Shit, yeah!

3204
03:19:39,412 --> 03:19:47,038
LAURA: Can I do anything else after I've done
that? I can't shoot any arrows after I've healed

3205
03:19:47,038 --> 03:19:49,224
him, can I? Do I get one arrow?

3206
03:19:49,224 --> 03:19:56,424
MATT: No, because it has to be-- as you get two
attacks. It's either you attack or you do

3207
03:19:56,424 --> 03:19:57,578
something else, so no.

3208
03:19:57,578 --> 03:20:04,740
LAURA: Okay. Then I'm going to, I guess, I'm going
to run back behind the tree because I'm a loser.

3209
03:20:04,740 --> 03:20:11,232
MATT: You do take-- that is your movement to get
there and back. You aren't taking slow steps.

3210
03:20:11,232 --> 03:20:15,589
That's going to be six points of piercing damage,
running across the glass.

3211
03:20:15,589 --> 03:20:23,135
LAURA: Jeez Louise. Okay.

3212
03:20:23,135 --> 03:20:32,253
MATT: All right. End of your turn? Vax, you're
up.

3213
03:20:32,253 --> 03:20:37,816
LAURA: Wait, wait. For my bonus action, I'm going
to cast Hex, I mean, not Hex, Hunter's Mark on

3214
03:20:37,816 --> 03:20:39,437
Ripley.

3215
03:20:39,437 --> 03:20:44,136
MATT: On Ripley? Let's do it. She is hunter
marked.

3216
03:20:44,136 --> 03:20:50,669
LIAM: I want to start moving toward my friends.
How far can I get toward Keyleth and Kynan and

3217
03:20:50,669 --> 03:20:53,268
Trinket on my movement?

3218
03:20:53,268 --> 03:20:55,895
MATT: I need you to make an athletics check.

3219
03:20:55,895 --> 03:21:00,880
LIAM: Athletics, you said? Seven.

3220
03:21:00,880 --> 03:21:05,401
MATT: You can't get out of the crevasse. You try
climbing and the rock's breaking away.

3221
03:21:05,401 --> 03:21:08,367
LIAM: On my movement? What happens with my dash
and my action?

3222
03:21:08,367 --> 03:21:09,799
MATT: Make another attempt.

3223
03:21:09,799 --> 03:21:13,227
LIAM: I'll do it again. Fucking A. Nine.

3224
03:21:13,227 --> 03:21:17,235
MATT: You get almost to the edge and the glass
breaks. You slide back down into the crevasse.

3225
03:21:17,235 --> 03:21:21,267
LIAM: Again. Natural 20.

3226
03:21:21,267 --> 03:21:28,577
MATT: You climb up to the edge. (panting) That's
your turn, but you're out of the crater.

3227
03:21:28,577 --> 03:21:35,423
LIAM: I'm going to shout: Kynan, you have a heart!
Think of Emon! What are you doing? It's not too late!

3228
03:21:35,423 --> 03:21:37,081
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

3229
03:21:37,081 --> 03:21:44,007
LIAM: 17. No, sorry, 19.

3230
03:21:44,007 --> 03:21:56,510
MATT: 19. Okay. That ends Vax's turn. Keyleth? I
need you to make a death saving throw.

3231
03:21:56,510 --> 03:21:59,182
MARISHA: 11.

3232
03:21:59,182 --> 03:22:00,457
MATT: 11, okay.

3233
03:22:00,457 --> 03:22:03,269
TALIESIN: You have a success!

3234
03:22:03,269 --> 03:22:15,586
MATT: All right, it is now Kynan's turn. Kynan is
stunned. The stun wears off at the end, but Kynan

3235
03:22:15,586 --> 03:22:21,551
is left there breathing heavy, looking down at the
two bleeding bodies before him. One that is, eyes

3236
03:22:21,551 --> 03:22:26,695
flash open on the ground, and Keyleth currently
face down in the dirt, with a little puddle of

3237
03:22:26,695 --> 03:22:34,838
blood around the corner of her mouth. At the end
of Kynan's turn, Scanlan, you are conscious, but

3238
03:22:34,838 --> 03:22:36,822
you are prone on the ground right now.

3239
03:22:36,822 --> 03:22:42,405
SAM: Ahh, what a crazy dream. Nope, it's real.

3240
03:22:42,405 --> 03:22:48,010
TALIESIN: Anything would be helpful right now.

3241
03:22:48,010 --> 03:22:50,852
LAURA: Scanlan! I'll tell you what I want, what I
really really want!

3242
03:22:50,852 --> 03:22:52,856
SAM: Well, tell me what you want, what you really
really want!

3243
03:22:52,856 --> 03:22:55,853
LAURA: I want-uh, I want-uh, I want-uh, I want to
go fuck them up!

3244
03:22:55,853 --> 03:22:59,630
SAM: All right. I run over to Keyleth.

3245
03:22:59,630 --> 03:23:04,783
MATT: That's half your movement. You can move that
far, and you take two points of piercing damage.

3246
03:23:04,783 --> 03:23:20,141
SAM: Yeah, sure. I'll Healing Word at level two to
get her back to life.

3247
03:23:20,141 --> 03:23:22,183
MATT: Okay, that's a bonus action. So that's 2d4
plus six.

3248
03:23:22,183 --> 03:23:31,033
SAM: 2d4 plus six is ten. No, 12.

3249
03:23:31,033 --> 03:23:34,659
MATT: All right, you come to consciousness.

3250
03:23:34,659 --> 03:23:43,441
SAM: I turn to fuck-nuts over there and I'll send
a Fireball to kill the fucking gunner.

3251
03:23:43,441 --> 03:23:47,566
MATT: Okay, what's the range of the fireball?

3252
03:23:47,566 --> 03:23:48,814
SAM: It's 150.

3253
03:23:48,814 --> 03:24:00,694
MATT: Yes, that'll do. She, with a roll of a
natural 17 plus, disadvantage on the dex. Oh no,

3254
03:24:00,694 --> 03:24:08,940
because you were unconscious, the hex is gone. You
probably would have lost concentration anyway, but

3255
03:24:08,940 --> 03:24:10,103
it's fine.

3256
03:24:10,103 --> 03:24:13,853
SAM: Oh, and I'll do three charges, so it's 10d6.

3257
03:24:13,853 --> 03:24:19,958
MATT: Okay, 10d6, all right. So yeah, she makes
her save on that. The gunner does not. The gunner

3258
03:24:19,958 --> 03:24:27,309
does not survive this no matter what you roll. The
gunner is a crispy pile of ash thrown toward the

3259
03:24:27,309 --> 03:24:29,580
back of-- go ahead and roll 10d6 damage.

3260
03:24:29,580 --> 03:24:44,435
SAM: 27. Not very good.

3261
03:24:44,435 --> 03:24:53,968
MATT: 27, halved to 13. The cloak flashes a bright
blue underneath and it seems almost like some of

3262
03:24:53,968 --> 03:24:59,892
the fire pulls into the cloak. It begins to glow
with this pulsing charge. She takes even less

3263
03:24:59,892 --> 03:25:10,101
damage than you expected. She takes some damage.
You can now see this crackle across the cloak. All

3264
03:25:10,101 --> 03:25:18,833
right. That's your turn. As the lightning's
crackling around her, she goes, "Well, sometimes

3265
03:25:18,833 --> 03:25:25,749
"you have to rely on those that prove worthy." The
shadow that's around her shoulders leaps off. You

3266
03:25:25,749 --> 03:25:35,288
watch as Orthax now appears next to her. The
shadow is still connecting them. You watch as this

3267
03:25:35,288 --> 03:25:40,803
long stretch of shadow curls across and attaches
to her leg. They're still bound by this tether of

3268
03:25:40,803 --> 03:25:54,256
darkness but, nevertheless, they are both together
on the field. Let's see. Orthax is going to go

3269
03:25:54,256 --> 03:26:05,967
ahead and (whooshing) there, and is going to go
ahead and look toward you and go, "You will be my

3270
03:26:05,967 --> 03:26:15,536
"quarry now, big man." You are currently hit with
the mark of vengeance.

3271
03:26:15,536 --> 03:26:17,198
TRAVIS: Is that a charm?

3272
03:26:17,198 --> 03:26:19,077
MATT: Nope! You are just marked.

3273
03:26:19,077 --> 03:26:23,567
TRAVIS: I'm marked. With vengeance?

3274
03:26:23,567 --> 03:26:35,183
MATT: The form is in a bad place right now. He's
there, out of desperation, but there is sunlight

3275
03:26:35,183 --> 03:26:40,956
coming down from the sky and you can see it's
hurting its presence but, once again, in a

3276
03:26:40,956 --> 03:26:46,073
desperate place. All right, up to the top. Percy.

3277
03:26:46,073 --> 03:26:48,639
TALIESIN: Oh good, you're awake.

3278
03:26:48,639 --> 03:26:51,309
MARISHA: (yelling) Fuck!

3279
03:26:51,309 --> 03:27:01,680
TALIESIN: I look at our little friend up there. I
get up a bit. I look at him. Just run! I pull out

3280
03:27:01,680 --> 03:27:10,503
my gun and I take the two shots, with the reload
that I'm allotted, at Ripley.

3281
03:27:10,503 --> 03:27:11,602
MATT: Okay.

3282
03:27:11,602 --> 03:27:23,695
TALIESIN: So, oh thank god it's the Retort pistol,
because that would have been really poor. That's a

3283
03:27:23,695 --> 03:27:26,207
29 to hit, and 15.

3284
03:27:26,207 --> 03:27:29,034
MATT: 29 hits, 15 does not.

3285
03:27:29,034 --> 03:27:37,661
TALIESIN: Okay, that's fine. That's 13 points of
piercing damage.

3286
03:27:37,661 --> 03:27:46,484
MATT: You see the flash of smoke off her shoulder
at the impact. You see her hair that's pulled up

3287
03:27:46,484 --> 03:27:50,654
has now fallen in her face now, covering part of
her in the front, where a little bit of blood

3288
03:27:50,654 --> 03:27:52,202
curls at the corner of her mouth.

3289
03:27:52,202 --> 03:27:57,767
TALIESIN: I doubt he'll do well without her! I try
and take cover. I'm going to pull as much cover as

3290
03:27:57,767 --> 03:28:06,018
I possibly can and take a defensive stance. Oh,
and I'm going to slug a healing potion for my

3291
03:28:06,018 --> 03:28:10,293
bonus, thank you. I meant to do that, I was
literally thinking that. That's the greater, which

3292
03:28:10,293 --> 03:28:29,681
is 4d4 plus four. Yeah, go on, I'm fine. I've got
so much coffee in me. Okay, I'm, yeah, that's so

3293
03:28:29,681 --> 03:28:31,047
sad. All right.

3294
03:28:31,047 --> 03:28:33,700
MATT: That ends your turn? Grog, you're up.

3295
03:28:33,700 --> 03:28:40,236
TRAVIS: I have one question. If I wanted to try
and double my speed or whatever, get around Orthax

3296
03:28:40,236 --> 03:28:44,156
to Ripley, would I still be able to hit her at
all, or would I have to burn all my attacks to get

3297
03:28:44,156 --> 03:28:45,382
to her?

3298
03:28:45,382 --> 03:28:53,511
MATT: You would have to use an action to dash.
Well, no, it's an action to do two attacks, so you

3299
03:28:53,511 --> 03:29:00,784
may-- let me double check really fast here. As
part of your frenzy--

3300
03:29:00,784 --> 03:29:04,829
TRAVIS: The frenzy's the bonus.

3301
03:29:04,829 --> 03:29:09,054
MATT: Yeah, which means you get one attack. You
would move, you would use your action to move

3302
03:29:09,054 --> 03:29:11,444
again, and you would have your bonus action to do
one hit.

3303
03:29:11,444 --> 03:29:15,703
TRAVIS: I grab my earring and I say, Orthax or
Ripley?

3304
03:29:15,703 --> 03:29:23,295
MARISHA: Aw, fucking Orthax, really? That's a name
I was hoping I wasn't going to hear again.

3305
03:29:23,295 --> 03:29:24,944
TALIESIN: Ripley!

3306
03:29:24,944 --> 03:29:28,560
TRAVIS: Can I burn that to get all the way--

3307
03:29:28,560 --> 03:29:38,572
MATT: You'll take an attack of opportunity if you
do so. (counting) Yeah, you'd get up right into

3308
03:29:38,572 --> 03:29:49,674
her face. Her eyes go wide as you approach. Orthax
does get an attack of opportunity against you. He

3309
03:29:49,674 --> 03:29:51,865
has advantage on attacks against a marked
creature.

3310
03:29:51,865 --> 03:29:53,627
TRAVIS: Plus I did Reckless, so.

3311
03:29:53,627 --> 03:30:00,514
LAURA: Do you get to hit him back as you run by,
as your reaction?

3312
03:30:00,593 --> 03:30:02,424
MATT: That's a 23 to hit.

3313
03:30:02,424 --> 03:30:03,518
TRAVIS: It does hit.

3314
03:30:03,518 --> 03:30:25,413
MATT: All right. You take (counting) 18 points--
no, I'm sorry. He had advantage on the roll. So

3315
03:30:25,413 --> 03:30:35,025
that would be 24 points of psychic damage as the
claw rakes through your body, missing your

3316
03:30:35,025 --> 03:30:40,021
corporeal form. It shocks into your system, your
brain spiking with pain.

3317
03:30:40,021 --> 03:30:44,361
TRAVIS: Do I get Retaliation? Is it a melee
attack?

3318
03:30:44,361 --> 03:30:46,326
MATT: It's your reaction to do it, so you could
run past and (whack).

3319
03:30:46,326 --> 03:30:47,918
TRAVIS: Let's do that.

3320
03:30:47,918 --> 03:30:53,009
MATT: You run. You get raked. You spin with the
axe and attempt to slam into it, using the

3321
03:30:53,009 --> 03:30:54,643
momentum to keep charging forward.

3322
03:30:54,643 --> 03:30:58,034
TRAVIS: 26.

3323
03:30:58,034 --> 03:31:00,055
MATT: 26 will hit. Roll damage.

3324
03:31:00,055 --> 03:31:04,587
TALIESIN: Literally attacking the darkness. This
is what DND is all about.

3325
03:31:04,587 --> 03:31:08,220
TRAVIS: 27, with five points of necrotic.

3326
03:31:08,220 --> 03:31:09,810
MATT: 27? Okay.

3327
03:31:09,810 --> 03:31:13,827
TALIESIN: He might laugh off necrotic.

3328
03:31:13,827 --> 03:31:17,567
TRAVIS: And I get all the way to Ripley?

3329
03:31:17,567 --> 03:31:22,915
MATT: You do, yeah. The Mark gives him advantage
on attacks, but the sunlight is giving him

3330
03:31:22,915 --> 03:31:26,372
disadvantage, so he just gets a single regular
roll against you. Anyone else, he's going to have

3331
03:31:26,372 --> 03:31:33,993
a harder time, but the Mark is helping him. You
get right up to Ripley, gun still in hand, seeing

3332
03:31:33,993 --> 03:31:40,082
you rush up angrily with your one angry, raging
goliath freight train of an individual. What do

3333
03:31:40,082 --> 03:31:41,320
you want to do?

3334
03:31:41,320 --> 03:31:45,471
TRAVIS: Nothing magic here, bitch. I will go
reckless, Great Weapon Master at Ripley, please.

3335
03:31:45,471 --> 03:31:49,529
SAM: Reckless, Great Weapon Master.

3336
03:31:49,529 --> 03:31:52,571
LIAM: I don't know what it means, but it sounds
good.

3337
03:31:52,571 --> 03:31:53,899
SAM: It sounds great.

3338
03:31:53,899 --> 03:31:57,017
TRAVIS: 28.

3339
03:31:57,017 --> 03:31:58,772
MATT: 28? That hits.

3340
03:31:58,772 --> 03:32:07,793
TRAVIS: Why am I not always doing Great Weapon
Master? What the fuck is the matter with me? 28,

3341
03:32:07,793 --> 03:32:09,623
with a point of necrotic.

3342
03:32:09,623 --> 03:32:18,089
MATT: A little bit of blood spatters across the
ground near her. She takes the wound and shrinks

3343
03:32:18,089 --> 03:32:20,285
away a bit, clutching her chest.

3344
03:32:20,285 --> 03:32:22,636
TRAVIS: What, the cloak not helping you with that
one?

3345
03:32:22,636 --> 03:32:33,596
MATT: Nice. That end your turn? It's now her turn.
First, she's going to use her bonus action to use

3346
03:32:33,596 --> 03:32:35,521
her Second Wind.

3347
03:32:35,521 --> 03:32:39,212
TALIESIN: She gets to heal.

3348
03:32:39,212 --> 03:32:41,368
SAM: She gets to fart twice, right in front of
you.

3349
03:32:41,368 --> 03:32:46,014
TRAVIS: What is that beautiful fragrance you're
wearing?

3350
03:32:46,014 --> 03:33:02,604
MATT: She is not attacking you in melee. Seeing
you in her face, she's like, "You're next." Leans

3351
03:33:02,604 --> 03:33:05,655
over and is going to fire at you, Percy.

3352
03:33:05,655 --> 03:33:09,842
TALIESIN: Can she make a ranged attack while
she's--

3353
03:33:09,842 --> 03:33:17,001
MATT: Yeah. She's in melee.

3354
03:33:17,001 --> 03:33:21,352
TALIESIN: I feel like I'm learning things here.

3355
03:33:21,352 --> 03:33:24,331
MATT: Well no, actually, you used your reaction to
hit Orthax, so she can move away from you without

3356
03:33:24,331 --> 03:33:31,422
getting an attack of opportunity. She does take
six points of damage from the run, but that gives

3357
03:33:31,422 --> 03:33:36,651
her a better angle on you. She's going to use
her--

3358
03:33:36,651 --> 03:33:38,434
TALIESIN: She's out of grit.

3359
03:33:38,434 --> 03:33:40,067
MATT: No, she has one more grit point.

3360
03:33:40,067 --> 03:33:42,279
SAM: She's better than you, Percy.

3361
03:33:42,279 --> 03:33:51,435
MATT: No, I think you're right. She did. She has
one more attack.

3362
03:33:51,435 --> 03:33:53,682
MARISHA: You're like the Olympian judging
the newer Olympian.

3363
03:33:53,682 --> 03:33:56,757
TALIESIN: I've had to deal with this shit so
much.

3364
03:33:56,757 --> 03:33:59,892
MATT: 21?

3365
03:33:59,892 --> 03:34:02,006
TALIESIN: That does not-- oh, do I still have some
cover?

3366
03:34:02,006 --> 03:34:03,688
MATT: With the cover, yeah.

3367
03:34:03,688 --> 03:34:05,821
TALIESIN: With the cover, does not hit.

3368
03:34:05,821 --> 03:34:13,052
MATT: Right. Natural 20, which gives her a grit
point back.

3369
03:34:13,052 --> 03:34:14,597
TALIESIN: Yes, it does.

3370
03:34:14,597 --> 03:34:16,858
TRAVIS: Wow, of all the things to roll.

3371
03:34:16,858 --> 03:34:19,294
TALIESIN: I had that coming.

3372
03:34:19,294 --> 03:34:22,586
TRAVIS: Yeah, you did. You had that coming more
than anybody.

3373
03:34:22,586 --> 03:34:25,544
MARISHA: I just broke my glass by biting into it.

3374
03:34:25,544 --> 03:34:33,336
MATT: 17 points of piercing damage and four points
of psychic damage.

3375
03:34:33,336 --> 03:34:35,954
TALIESIN: Has she not lost her-- is the psychic
damage attached?

3376
03:34:35,954 --> 03:34:39,839
MATT: The psychic damage is a thing you don't
know.

3377
03:34:39,839 --> 03:34:47,190
TALIESIN: Oh, a thing I don't know, so it's just a
thing. I'm going to try and catch it, so we'll see

3378
03:34:47,190 --> 03:34:52,937
how that goes. I'm trying to find the die for
that, which seems to have vanished. There we are.

3379
03:34:52,937 --> 03:35:07,592
17 points? All right, let's see what this does.
Okay, so that's down to nine points. Okay. So is

3380
03:35:07,592 --> 03:35:09,701
it 17 total?

3381
03:35:09,701 --> 03:35:16,398
MATT: It's 17 points of piercing damage plus four
points psychic.

3382
03:35:16,398 --> 03:35:26,828
TALIESIN: Okay, so that's nine plus four, so
that's 13 points. I am still standing. I am

3383
03:35:26,828 --> 03:35:29,677
Rasputin here. This is getting ugly.

3384
03:35:29,677 --> 03:35:32,194
MATT: Third and final shot.

3385
03:35:32,194 --> 03:35:35,774
LAURA: Oh god, she gets to shoot again! Misfire!

3386
03:35:35,774 --> 03:35:41,288
MATT: Nope. That is a 26 to hit.

3387
03:35:41,288 --> 03:35:42,664
TALIESIN: That hits.

3388
03:35:42,664 --> 03:35:48,494
MATT: You take 11 points of piercing damage plus
four psychic.

3389
03:35:48,494 --> 03:35:57,550
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, no, I'm out again. But she's
out of shots.

3390
03:35:57,550 --> 03:36:01,493
SAM: Pike's necklace goes, meh?

3391
03:36:01,493 --> 03:36:07,443
MATT: (zap) All right.

3392
03:36:07,443 --> 03:36:09,186
MARISHA: She's out? She's gone?

3393
03:36:09,186 --> 03:36:11,367
MATT: She vanished. Vex, you're up.

3394
03:36:11,367 --> 03:36:13,350
LAURA: Do I sense her with my Hunter's Mark?

3395
03:36:13,350 --> 03:36:16,144
TRAVIS: Are you fucking kidding me?!

3396
03:36:16,144 --> 03:36:18,752
TALIESIN: But she ran her full movement, didn't
she?

3397
03:36:18,752 --> 03:36:21,993
MATT: She did move her full movement, yeah.

3398
03:36:21,993 --> 03:36:25,185
MARISHA: But she's got fancy things.

3399
03:36:25,185 --> 03:36:29,852
LAURA: I want to try to shoot where she was.

3400
03:36:29,852 --> 03:36:32,037
MATT: Okay, go for it. Roll for two attacks.

3401
03:36:32,037 --> 03:36:35,943
LAURA: I just want to shoot one where she was.

3402
03:36:36,038 --> 03:36:37,696
MATT: First attack?

3403
03:36:37,696 --> 03:36:39,299
LAURA: 19.

3404
03:36:39,299 --> 03:36:44,202
MATT: 19? Seems to pass through. What are you
going to do?

3405
03:36:44,202 --> 03:36:49,372
LAURA: Fuck. I'm going to shoot at Orthax.

3406
03:36:49,372 --> 03:36:51,167
MATT: Okay, go for it.

3407
03:36:51,167 --> 03:36:58,002
LAURA: Natural one.

3408
03:36:58,002 --> 03:37:03,788
MATT: The arrow goes high over the tree line and
disappears in the distant jungle.

3409
03:37:03,788 --> 03:37:18,929
LAURA: Sweet. Tight. I'm going to get on my damn
broom, and I'm going to get up to the top of the

3410
03:37:18,929 --> 03:37:20,577
tree that I'm at right now.

3411
03:37:20,577 --> 03:37:23,820
SAM: That is a bold, scaredy-cat move.

3412
03:37:23,820 --> 03:37:28,975
LAURA: I'm doing it so I don't have to take a
point of damage every step I take.

3413
03:37:28,975 --> 03:37:40,881
MATT: You get up to the top of your tree right
here, up above the tree, looking down into this

3414
03:37:40,881 --> 03:37:45,410
open area. That ends your turn? Vax, you're up.

3415
03:37:45,410 --> 03:37:47,671
LIAM: Where's Kynan at?

3416
03:37:47,671 --> 03:37:49,523
MATT: Kynan's over here on top of the tree.

3417
03:37:49,523 --> 03:37:50,939
LIAM: Is he out, or is he just standing there?

3418
03:37:50,939 --> 03:37:54,193
MATT: He just got out of being stunned at being
shocked with Diplomacy.

3419
03:37:54,193 --> 03:38:07,497
LIAM: I'm going to use my movement to get to
Percival. Close enough. I'll use my bonus action

3420
03:38:07,497 --> 03:38:12,908
to get all the way, and I'll cast Lay on Hands
with my action to get him on his feet again. Five

3421
03:38:12,908 --> 03:38:14,180
hit points.

3422
03:38:14,180 --> 03:38:16,717
TALIESIN: Oh, this is getting uncomfortable!

3423
03:38:16,717 --> 03:38:18,421
LIAM: Kynan.

3424
03:38:18,421 --> 03:38:24,157
LAURA: Kynan!

3425
03:38:24,157 --> 03:38:26,339
SAM: Just kill him!

3426
03:38:26,339 --> 03:38:29,350
LIAM: You're all right.

3427
03:38:29,350 --> 03:38:33,193
MATT: Persuasion roll.

3428
03:38:33,193 --> 03:38:41,859
LIAM: Balls. No, not bad, because I'm a rogue.
17.

3429
03:38:41,859 --> 03:38:46,461
MATT: All right, good to know. That ends your
turn. Keyleth.

3430
03:38:46,461 --> 03:38:53,763
MARISHA: Okay, so I'm waking up, and the first
thing I heard was Grog saying, "Orthax or Ripley?"

3431
03:38:53,763 --> 03:39:11,152
Correct? Fucking gods! And I'm going to throw down
a Daylight spell on the nipple. The crevasse

3432
03:39:11,152 --> 03:39:22,360
nipple on stage right. My stage right. Daylight on
nipple, stage right!

3433
03:39:22,360 --> 03:39:30,752
MATT: You're in daylight. Adding Daylight isn't
going to make a huge difference in daylight.

3434
03:39:30,752 --> 03:39:35,636
MARISHA: But I thought Orthax is a shadow fiend,
right?

3435
03:39:35,636 --> 03:39:37,921
MATT: Yeah, and he's currently in sunlight.

3436
03:39:37,921 --> 03:39:43,114
MARISHA: And he's having a hard time? I thought
we're under tree cover, no?

3437
03:39:43,114 --> 03:39:46,141
MATT: No, there's no tree cover. All the trees got
blown out of this area from the explosion, so

3438
03:39:46,141 --> 03:39:50,179
adding Daylight would just make daylight in
daylight.

3439
03:39:50,179 --> 03:39:58,576
MARISHA: I have burned through everything that's
nice like that. Okay, never mind. I'm going to get

3440
03:39:58,576 --> 03:40:00,767
up and I'm going--

3441
03:40:00,767 --> 03:40:03,616
SAM: Elemental!

3442
03:40:03,616 --> 03:40:09,959
MARISHA: I can't do that. I'm done. I'm going
to--

3443
03:40:09,959 --> 03:40:13,564
TRAVIS: Use your staff!

3444
03:40:13,564 --> 03:40:22,965
MARISHA: Fuck it. Percy, kill them! And I'm going
to Cure Wounds at level three. Fucking kill her!

3445
03:40:22,965 --> 03:40:28,191
This is <i>your</i> post-traumatic stress that we're
dealing with here!

3446
03:40:28,191 --> 03:40:30,353
TALIESIN: I'm sorry my issues have guns.

3447
03:40:30,353 --> 03:40:56,274
MARISHA: It's 3d8 plus ten. Yeah, 22. Fucking kill
her! And then I'll actually take a bonus action to

3448
03:40:56,274 --> 03:41:00,199
do a Healing Word on myself at level one

3449
03:41:00,199 --> 03:41:08,512
TRAVIS: Is the tether between he and Ripley
physical?

3450
03:41:08,512 --> 03:41:13,952
MATT: You don't know; you haven't messed with it,
and right now you see the tether reaches out and

3451
03:41:13,952 --> 03:41:23,016
then dissipates, fades. It's still facing this
direction. It's just faded. All right, end of your

3452
03:41:23,016 --> 03:41:24,088
turn, Keyleth?

3453
03:41:24,088 --> 03:41:29,674
MARISHA: Yeah. I'm still coughing up blood in the
fetal position, trying to keep Percy alive.

3454
03:41:29,674 --> 03:41:39,982
MATT: All right. Kynan steps off the back of the
log, out of sight. There's a small gap beneath the

3455
03:41:39,982 --> 03:41:47,422
log where Kynan comes out from underneath, as you
finish the healing spell, and takes the blade and

3456
03:41:47,422 --> 03:41:53,841
jams it right into your back. Tries to, at least.
That is 23.

3457
03:41:53,841 --> 03:41:55,799
MARISHA: To hit me? Yeah.

3458
03:41:55,799 --> 03:41:57,816
TALIESIN: God fucking damn it.

3459
03:41:57,816 --> 03:42:02,433
TRAVIS: That seals it, buddy.

3460
03:42:02,433 --> 03:42:06,573
LAURA: Your little project just killed your
girlfriend.

3461
03:42:06,573 --> 03:42:08,314
TRAVIS: Did you go unconscious?

3462
03:42:08,314 --> 03:42:10,785
MARISHA: We'll see. Probably, though.

3463
03:42:10,785 --> 03:42:20,916
MATT: (adding) 26 points of damage.

3464
03:42:20,916 --> 03:42:22,772
LAURA: Is that sneak attack?

3465
03:42:22,772 --> 03:42:29,407
MATT: He jumped over the top, hid, and then came
underneath and got her. As soon as he sees you

3466
03:42:29,407 --> 03:42:39,905
fall, he pulls the blade out and drops it to the
ground and goes, "I'm sorry!" and falls to his

3467
03:42:39,905 --> 03:42:42,293
knees and starts shaking in place.

3468
03:42:42,293 --> 03:42:48,164
TRAVIS: I'll leave that up to your discretion.

3469
03:42:48,164 --> 03:42:50,412
MATT: That's going to end his turn. Scanlan,
you're up.

3470
03:42:50,412 --> 03:42:52,649
SAM: I look at Keyleth, and I fucking heal her.

3471
03:42:52,649 --> 03:42:56,145
(laughter)

3472
03:42:56,145 --> 03:43:02,648
LIAM: It's like, heal! Boom! Heal! Boom! Heal!
Boom!

3473
03:43:02,648 --> 03:43:08,345
TALIESIN: Has anyone else ever been to a horse
tranquilizer party? Because it's like that. And

3474
03:43:08,345 --> 03:43:10,802
Epipen! Except you can't afford to do them
anymore, sadly.

3475
03:43:10,802 --> 03:43:13,233
LAURA: Are you unconscious, too?

3476
03:43:13,233 --> 03:43:18,453
TALIESIN: I'm awake again. I was, but now I am
awake.

3477
03:43:18,453 --> 03:43:24,798
SAM: I will level-one Healing Word, bonus action.
Nine. You're at nine.

3478
03:43:24,798 --> 03:43:30,072
MARISHA: I don't like being unconscious! Okay,
keep going.

3479
03:43:30,072 --> 03:43:41,138
SAM: Someone's got to do this, and it can't just
be Grog. I'm going to Dimension Door over right

3480
03:43:41,138 --> 03:43:53,371
next to Grog. Yep. Toward Ripley's side. Yeah,
then I'm going to use the rest of my movement to

3481
03:43:53,371 --> 03:43:56,988
move around, 25 feet, and go like this. Looking
for Ripley.

3482
03:43:56,988 --> 03:44:05,430
MATT: Take five points of piercing damage running
across the glass. You start waving your hands freely.

3483
03:44:05,430 --> 03:44:10,265
LAURA: Use your sword to do it!

3484
03:44:10,265 --> 03:44:13,672
SAM: Sure, whatever.

3485
03:44:13,672 --> 03:44:17,335
MATT: As you swing it around and you're moving
around, nothing.

3486
03:44:17,335 --> 03:44:20,224
LAURA: Maybe she goes into another dimension or
something.

3487
03:44:20,224 --> 03:44:22,724
MARISHA: This is the worst game of Minesweeper.

3488
03:44:22,724 --> 03:44:32,392
MATT: Now Orthax is going to Dimension Door.

3489
03:44:32,392 --> 03:44:35,609
LIAM: Hey, everybody wake up!

3490
03:44:35,609 --> 03:44:39,996
LAURA: Orthax just bamfed!

3491
03:44:39,996 --> 03:44:58,029
MATT: And then would move over there. Yeah, no,
because he can jump through shadow.

3492
03:44:58,029 --> 03:45:03,412
SAM: As a smoke monster, wouldn't he hurt his
feetsies on the glass?

3493
03:45:03,412 --> 03:45:07,885
LAURA: There's shadow? What shadow is he using?

3494
03:45:07,885 --> 03:45:09,715
TALIESIN: A moon shadow.

3495
03:45:09,715 --> 03:45:12,256
LAURA: I don't see any shadows.

3496
03:45:12,256 --> 03:45:17,666
MATT: He's going to use his rampage pulse.

3497
03:45:17,666 --> 03:45:20,402
SAM: That sounds like an awesome band name.

3498
03:45:20,402 --> 03:45:22,505
LAURA: Are we really all going to die today?

3499
03:45:22,505 --> 03:45:26,132
MARISHA: I know. Your inner insecurities cannot be
the cause of Vox Machina's death.

3500
03:45:26,132 --> 03:45:28,826
TALIESIN: I'm aware.

3501
03:45:28,826 --> 03:45:33,681
SAM: Taliesin, we are being killed by a metaphor
right now.

3502
03:45:33,681 --> 03:45:35,350
TALIESIN: Aren't we always?

3503
03:45:35,350 --> 03:45:41,860
MATT: So I need Vax, Percy, Keyleth, and Kynan to
all make a wisdom saving throw.

3504
03:45:41,860 --> 03:45:44,964
(groaning)

3505
03:45:44,964 --> 03:45:47,657
LAURA: I like how everybody's like, I am really
not wise.

3506
03:45:47,657 --> 03:45:57,991
TALIESIN: I'm rerolling that. Seven.

3507
03:45:57,991 --> 03:46:01,141
MARISHA: 30 total.

3508
03:46:01,141 --> 03:46:16,467
MATT: All right. Percy, you take ten points of
psychic damage. Still conscious, though, right?

3509
03:46:16,467 --> 03:46:29,832
Vax, you also take ten points of psychic damage.
Kynan actually does make his save, strangely.

3510
03:46:29,832 --> 03:46:44,735
Really high roll. However, Percy, as you feel the
rampage pulse hit you, your eyes go red, and

3511
03:46:44,735 --> 03:46:48,922
suddenly you're surrounded by shadow entirely. You
pull the gun over, and you fire at something

3512
03:46:48,922 --> 03:46:56,492
that's nearby. I need you to make a single pistol
attack, with disadvantage, against Keyleth.

3513
03:46:56,492 --> 03:47:06,134
TALIESIN: With disadvantage? Wow, this is here to
hurt me. Let's pistol shot with disadvantage.

3514
03:47:06,134 --> 03:47:12,944
Three, so 16.

3515
03:47:12,944 --> 03:47:15,477
MARISHA: Misses.

3516
03:47:15,477 --> 03:47:22,461
MATT: Strikes the wood and splinters off. Vax, I
need you to make a dagger attack against Percy.

3517
03:47:22,461 --> 03:47:27,623
LIAM: That is a 17.

3518
03:47:27,623 --> 03:47:29,037
TALIESIN: Misses!

3519
03:47:29,037 --> 03:47:30,856
MATT: What did you roll?

3520
03:47:30,856 --> 03:47:33,755
LIAM: I rolled a six, plus 11, is 17.

3521
03:47:33,755 --> 03:47:38,784
MATT: Percy is, however, prone, so you have
advantage on the attack.

3522
03:47:38,784 --> 03:47:43,659
LIAM: That hits. That is a 28.

3523
03:47:43,659 --> 03:47:45,492
MATT: It's not a sneak attack.

3524
03:47:45,492 --> 03:47:53,134
LIAM: Okay, whatever you say, boss. That is a
seven.

3525
03:47:53,134 --> 03:48:01,435
MATT: Seven points of damage to you. That ends
Orthax's turn.

3526
03:48:01,435 --> 03:48:03,295
LIAM: This is a shitshow, man.

3527
03:48:03,295 --> 03:48:10,168
MATT: Percival, you're up.

3528
03:48:10,168 --> 03:48:28,141
TALIESIN: Oh my god. I'm going to climb. Can I
stand up and climb on top of the-- he doesn't have

3529
03:48:28,141 --> 03:48:30,725
an attack of opportunity against me. Where he is
right now?

3530
03:48:30,725 --> 03:48:32,058
MATT: You'll find out.

3531
03:48:32,058 --> 03:48:41,624
TALIESIN: I'm going to stand up, and I'm going to
ignore him. I'm going to hold my attack until I

3532
03:48:41,624 --> 03:48:50,112
see her. The second I see her, I'm going to
attack. Then as a fucking bonus action, I'm going

3533
03:48:50,112 --> 03:48:53,928
to drink my last potion. A regular.

3534
03:48:53,928 --> 03:48:55,979
MATT: 2d4 plus two.

3535
03:48:55,979 --> 03:49:03,863
LAURA: We need a cleric! We need a cleric with us
all the time!

3536
03:49:03,863 --> 03:49:05,343
LIAM: Ash-o-lee!

3537
03:49:05,343 --> 03:49:07,675
MATT: Grog, you're up.

3538
03:49:07,675 --> 03:49:18,666
TRAVIS: Right now? Oh, it's my turn. Can I join
Scanlan in the most Stevie Wonder search ever,

3539
03:49:18,666 --> 03:49:21,893
with my bloodaxe being my stick?

3540
03:49:21,893 --> 03:49:25,198
TALIESIN: You can hold your attack until she
appears again.

3541
03:49:25,198 --> 03:49:31,750
TRAVIS: All right, I'll move over to where I am
and hold my attack and hope I bump into something

3542
03:49:31,750 --> 03:49:36,991
along the way. I've got persistent rage, so I
don't lose my rage.

3543
03:49:36,991 --> 03:49:43,977
MATT: Good to know. All right, at the end of your
turn, (zap) she appears over there.

3544
03:49:43,977 --> 03:49:46,193
MARISHA: Wait, did he find her?

3545
03:49:46,193 --> 03:49:55,199
MATT: Her turn came about. Two of you have actions
that have been held. Percy and Grog.

3546
03:49:55,199 --> 03:49:59,336
TRAVIS: Reckless.

3547
03:49:59,336 --> 03:50:04,103
MATT: You're not within range to enter melee, so
you can do one Chain of Returning throw attack.

3548
03:50:04,103 --> 03:50:06,155
TRAVIS: The chain is magic.

3549
03:50:06,155 --> 03:50:12,410
MATT: Or throw the axe and let it sit there.

3550
03:50:12,410 --> 03:50:15,627
LAURA: Are you sure it's magic? Are you sure it's
just not a chain that he gave you?

3551
03:50:15,627 --> 03:50:16,966
TRAVIS: It's magic.

3552
03:50:16,966 --> 03:50:19,784
TALIESIN: The returning was inside you all along.

3553
03:50:19,784 --> 03:50:30,104
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm going to attach the chain and
throw it. Reckless, Great Weapon Master. All

3554
03:50:30,104 --> 03:50:43,852
right. Which one? All right, Gil. There's only one
that could beat that one. So that's a 32 minus

3555
03:50:43,852 --> 03:50:45,294
five. 28.

3556
03:50:45,294 --> 03:50:46,518
MATT: That'll hit.

3557
03:50:46,518 --> 03:50:47,727
LAURA: You keep rolling that high.

3558
03:50:47,727 --> 03:50:57,428
TRAVIS: I know. Fucker. 16, 18, 28. 28 with two
points of necrotic.

3559
03:50:57,428 --> 03:51:03,690
MATT: 28 points of damage. (impact) It slams into
her, and the axe slices and carves off part of her

3560
03:51:03,690 --> 03:51:10,658
arm, the giant shadow claw that she still has on
the other side clutching the weapon. She angrily

3561
03:51:10,658 --> 03:51:16,075
looks over her shoulder. "Shit!" That's your
turn?

3562
03:51:16,075 --> 03:51:17,559
TRAVIS: I yank it back.

3563
03:51:17,559 --> 03:51:19,063
MATT: You can on your next turn.

3564
03:51:19,063 --> 03:51:20,402
TRAVIS: Got it.

3565
03:51:20,402 --> 03:51:31,836
TALIESIN: Sharpshooter shot, Retort. Misses. 12.

3566
03:51:31,836 --> 03:51:33,358
MATT: 12, no.

3567
03:51:33,358 --> 03:51:37,916
TALIESIN: Sharpshooter shot, Retort. 20.

3568
03:51:37,916 --> 03:51:46,037
MATT: 20. That would hit, but she uses her
reaction to use another Shield. The bullet is

3569
03:51:46,037 --> 03:51:51,789
deflected off an arcane shield on this side. She's
like, axe off Grog, deflects the bullet this side.

3570
03:51:51,789 --> 03:51:54,137
She is cornered and trying the best she can to get
through this.

3571
03:51:54,137 --> 03:52:07,142
TALIESIN: (sighs) That's all I got, because I
burned a shot attacking Keyleth, so I have to

3572
03:52:07,142 --> 03:52:27,432
reload. (sighs) Yeah, I'm going to stare at her
and the best thing I'm going to do is: No matter

3573
03:52:27,432 --> 03:52:40,217
what today, I forgive you, but I cannot let you
leave. And I'm going to sit and reload.

3574
03:52:40,217 --> 03:53:03,306
MATT: Okay. She is going to use her first attack
to reload her pepperbox. Let's see here... Okay.

3575
03:53:03,306 --> 03:53:17,261
She is going to look over with her clawed hand.
Actually, no. She doesn't reload. I'm sorry, she

3576
03:53:17,261 --> 03:53:22,132
has that back. As opposed to reloading, she looks
at her weapon, puts it in her off hand, takes her

3577
03:53:22,132 --> 03:53:27,495
clawed hand and points a finger over in your
direction and releases a single beam of red energy

3578
03:53:27,495 --> 03:53:30,239
that detonates there in the center of the--

3579
03:53:30,239 --> 03:53:32,590
SAM: I will Counterspell that at level six.

3580
03:53:32,590 --> 03:53:34,289
TALIESIN: Bless you.

3581
03:53:34,289 --> 03:53:39,243
LAURA: Yes. Scanlan.

3582
03:53:39,243 --> 03:53:41,199
TALIESIN: Scanlan for the win.

3583
03:53:41,199 --> 03:53:43,032
LAURA: Clutch.

3584
03:53:43,032 --> 03:53:50,964
MATT: (laughs) Okay, at level six. I believe
that's a 3rd-level spell.

3585
03:53:50,964 --> 03:53:54,542
SAM: A 3rd-level spell? It's gone.

3586
03:53:54,542 --> 03:54:02,626
MATT: Yeah, it's gone. Yeah, boom. She's not that
powerful of a mage. Multiclass doesn't go that far

3587
03:54:02,626 --> 03:54:03,996
in a wizard.

3588
03:54:03,996 --> 03:54:05,138
TRAVIS: What was that?

3589
03:54:05,138 --> 03:54:08,210
MATT: It was a Fireball. She goes to release it,
and you shout out towards it.

3590
03:54:08,210 --> 03:54:15,990
SAM: I shout out: (singing) Anna-anna, bo-bana,
banana fana fo-fana, hey fi-fo-mana. Fuck you!

3591
03:54:15,990 --> 03:54:18,273
(laughter)

3592
03:54:18,273 --> 03:54:30,144
MATT: She's going to move. She's going to take six
points of piercing damage and (zap).

3593
03:54:30,144 --> 03:54:31,783
TRAVIS: Goddamn it!

3594
03:54:31,783 --> 03:54:33,382
TALIESIN: How can she still do that?

3595
03:54:33,382 --> 03:54:37,039
MATT: It's an effect that you are unfamiliar
with.

3596
03:54:37,039 --> 03:54:38,274
LIAM: Vestige.

3597
03:54:38,274 --> 03:54:43,113
MARISHA: An effect that you are unfamiliar-- what
the shit, man.

3598
03:54:43,113 --> 03:54:47,329
MATT: Now that you've been up close and seen the
effect, roll an arcana check.

3599
03:54:47,329 --> 03:54:48,566
SAM: Me?

3600
03:54:48,566 --> 03:54:50,281
MATT: Yeah. Bard of many things.

3601
03:54:50,281 --> 03:54:51,769
LAURA: Please roll high.

3602
03:54:51,769 --> 03:54:54,806
SAM: 22.

3603
03:54:54,806 --> 03:54:59,115
MATT: 22. You haven't really seen the spell done,
but you've heard in your travels, there are

3604
03:54:59,115 --> 03:55:03,007
certain mages, certain not-too-powerful magics
that essentially cause individuals to occasionally

3605
03:55:03,007 --> 03:55:06,122
blink into another dimension briefly and then come
back out.

3606
03:55:06,122 --> 03:55:08,375
SAM: I've heard of them.

3607
03:55:08,375 --> 03:55:14,213
MATT: That ends her turn. Vex, you're up.

3608
03:55:14,213 --> 03:55:16,709
LAURA: Right after she disappears.

3609
03:55:16,709 --> 03:55:17,771
MATT: Yeah.

3610
03:55:17,771 --> 03:55:21,847
LAURA: Great. I guess I will shoot at Orthax.

3611
03:55:21,847 --> 03:55:23,383
MATT: All righty.

3612
03:55:23,383 --> 03:55:31,343
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to try to Bramble Shot
him.

3613
03:55:31,343 --> 03:55:33,004
MATT: Sure, go for it.

3614
03:55:33,004 --> 03:55:39,061
LAURA: Okay. 31.

3615
03:55:39,061 --> 03:55:43,303
MATT: 31. That hits.

3616
03:55:43,303 --> 03:55:46,177
LIAM: Like water splashed on a cat.

3617
03:55:46,177 --> 03:55:57,491
TALIESIN: Oh shit, I burned that trying to make
that thing.

3618
03:55:57,491 --> 03:56:01,070
LAURA: Do I add anything to that damage? Or is
that just 4d8 piercing?

3619
03:56:01,070 --> 03:56:06,125
MATT: It's 4d8 piercing, and you would probably
add your additional lightning damage.

3620
03:56:06,125 --> 03:56:16,557
LAURA: So 16 with three lightning, and then he has
to do a strength save or be restrained.

3621
03:56:16,557 --> 03:56:21,823
MATT: Strength save. That is 19.

3622
03:56:21,823 --> 03:56:25,858
LAURA: He is not restrained. I'm going to use my
second attack.

3623
03:56:25,858 --> 03:56:31,728
MATT: Okay, so the brambles reach up out of the
arrow and wrap around him, all the thorns

3624
03:56:31,728 --> 03:56:39,953
constricting and tearing into him. Actually, he--
no, he doesn't have disadvantage on saving throws,

3625
03:56:39,953 --> 03:56:44,492
just on his perception and attack rolls. So yeah,
he does break free and all the brambles shatter

3626
03:56:44,492 --> 03:56:46,776
and break off around him. You go for your second
attack, which is?

3627
03:56:46,776 --> 03:56:47,913
LAURA: 31.

3628
03:56:47,913 --> 03:57:00,324
MATT: 31 hits. Roll damage. Down to the wire.
Clutch Counterspell, man.

3629
03:57:00,324 --> 03:57:01,730
LAURA: 18.

3630
03:57:01,730 --> 03:57:03,932
MATT: 18 damage, nice.

3631
03:57:03,932 --> 03:57:07,600
LIAM: That is insane.

3632
03:57:07,600 --> 03:57:09,126
TRAVIS: Yes.

3633
03:57:09,126 --> 03:57:16,606
MATT: All righty, so that ends Vex's turn. Vax,
you're up.

3634
03:57:16,606 --> 03:57:24,045
LIAM: I'm conscious. I'm going to use people being
around Orthax and stab him a couple of times.

3635
03:57:24,045 --> 03:57:29,428
MATT: There's nobody currently in melee or someone
who is up against him, because you backed away

3636
03:57:29,428 --> 03:57:31,158
from him. When you got up, you were still--

3637
03:57:31,158 --> 03:57:33,335
TALIESIN: No, I decided not to back away.

3638
03:57:33,335 --> 03:57:36,428
MATT: No, when you got up, that's the space you
were taking. You're still within melee. He has a

3639
03:57:36,428 --> 03:57:37,645
ten-foot reach.

3640
03:57:37,645 --> 03:57:43,548
MARISHA: I stood up, too, to cast-- what was it
that I cast last?

3641
03:57:43,548 --> 03:57:45,663
TALIESIN: Heal. No, wait, something.

3642
03:57:45,663 --> 03:57:47,505
MARISHA: No.

3643
03:57:47,505 --> 03:57:50,898
TALIESIN: The wine was a poor choice. It was a
good wine, but it was a poor choice.

3644
03:57:50,898 --> 03:57:53,710
SAM: You cast Heal on Percy last. That was the
last thing you did.

3645
03:57:53,710 --> 03:57:55,517
MARISHA: No, that was a long time ago.

3646
03:57:55,517 --> 03:57:57,615
SAM: You used Healing Word.

3647
03:57:57,615 --> 03:58:01,760
MARISHA: Oh, I did cast Healing Word. Yes, I cast
Cure Wounds and heal, so I'm up.

3648
03:58:01,760 --> 03:58:03,954
MATT: You would have been up, but you're still out
of melee of him.

3649
03:58:03,954 --> 03:58:05,563
MARISHA: Am I? Fuck. All right, keep going.

3650
03:58:05,563 --> 03:58:07,004
MATT: Or out of your own melee.

3651
03:58:07,004 --> 03:58:08,141
MARISHA: That's fine.

3652
03:58:08,141 --> 03:58:15,407
LIAM: Then can I go three squares north to the
edge and hold my attack until someone steps up?

3653
03:58:15,407 --> 03:58:19,675
MATT: Sure. You are still in his melee range, by
the way.

3654
03:58:19,675 --> 03:58:21,737
LIAM: Within melee range?

3655
03:58:21,737 --> 03:58:23,230
MATT: He has a ten-foot reach.

3656
03:58:23,230 --> 03:58:29,758
LIAM: Then I will continue along the edge to that
pointy crack in the ground so I'm out of range.

3657
03:58:29,758 --> 03:58:32,669
MATT: Right there? That will get you out of his
melee range, but he will get an attack of

3658
03:58:32,669 --> 03:58:33,593
opportunity on you.

3659
03:58:33,593 --> 03:58:34,822
LIAM: That's all right.

3660
03:58:34,822 --> 03:58:36,533
MATT: All right. He will take his attack of
opportunity on you.

3661
03:58:36,533 --> 03:58:37,719
LIAM: At disadvantage.

3662
03:58:37,719 --> 03:58:47,635
MATT: Yes. At disadvantage, also because of the
sunlight. So that's 25 and 19.

3663
03:58:47,635 --> 03:58:49,026
LIAM: Misses.

3664
03:58:49,026 --> 03:58:54,821
MATT: You duck underneath. All right, finishing
Vax's turn. Keyleth, you're up.

3665
03:58:54,821 --> 03:58:58,584
MARISHA: Oh shit. I'm up, okay.

3666
03:58:58,584 --> 03:59:00,084
SAM: You're alive for once.

3667
03:59:00,084 --> 03:59:10,759
MARISHA: I'm fucking alive. Running out of options
here. Ripley's not on the board or anything,

3668
03:59:10,759 --> 03:59:14,317
right? We only have Orthax in front of us, and
he's all that's left?

3669
03:59:14,317 --> 03:59:17,752
TALIESIN: Until we hold and we wait for her to
appear again, which she will inevitably will.

3670
03:59:17,752 --> 03:59:37,117
MARISHA: Wow, this isn't good at all. Wow, cool.
All I have left is a Thunderwave.

3671
03:59:37,117 --> 03:59:40,622
SAM: Yeah, that's fun. Do that.

3672
03:59:40,622 --> 03:59:45,445
MARISHA: So in a fit of fight or flight--

3673
03:59:45,445 --> 03:59:47,337
SAM: Wait. No.

3674
03:59:47,337 --> 03:59:48,405
MARISHA: What?

3675
03:59:48,405 --> 03:59:49,648
LIAM: No, go.

3676
03:59:49,648 --> 03:59:55,181
MARISHA: That's all I've got. In a fit of fight
or flight, as I'm standing up, I smack down on the

3677
03:59:55,181 --> 04:00:00,092
ground and hit a Thunderwave around me, because
that's all I have.

3678
04:00:00,092 --> 04:00:03,185
MATT: A 15-foot cube you can do right there and
not hit any of your party members, and it'll hit Orthax.

3679
04:00:03,185 --> 04:00:05,457
MARISHA: It'll hit who? Vex?

3680
04:00:05,457 --> 04:00:06,672
LAURA: No, Orthax.

3681
04:00:06,672 --> 04:00:08,194
MARISHA: Only Orthax? Cool.

3682
04:00:08,194 --> 04:00:16,952
MATT: Has a constitution saving throw. 16.

3683
04:00:16,952 --> 04:00:20,067
MARISHA: No, fail.

3684
04:00:20,067 --> 04:00:23,196
MATT: So 2d8 thunder damage, go ahead and roll
that, and it's pushed ten feet away from you.

3685
04:00:23,196 --> 04:00:29,555
MARISHA: Ooh, 11 damage. No, sorry, ten damage.

3686
04:00:29,555 --> 04:00:35,873
MATT: Ten points of thunder damage, reduced by
half because of his resistances, so he takes five.

3687
04:00:35,873 --> 04:00:43,002
All righty. It blasts him back. Orthax (growls).

3688
04:00:43,002 --> 04:00:51,805
MARISHA: I stand up, and as a reaction, I'm going
to cast Healing Word on myself once again at first level.

3689
04:00:51,805 --> 04:00:53,952
MATT: Okay, go for it.

3690
04:00:53,952 --> 04:00:59,070
MARISHA: I heal eight points.

3691
04:00:59,070 --> 04:01:07,770
MATT: Kynan is still on the ground, wrestling with
the whole circumstance. Okay. Kynan looks up at

3692
04:01:07,770 --> 04:01:14,708
Keyleth standing up, after stabbing her and
watching her fall; seems to be really noticing the

3693
04:01:14,708 --> 04:01:18,299
tide turning. Looking up toward you--

3694
04:01:18,299 --> 04:01:25,873
MARISHA: I look at him, and I stare daggers into
him and shake my head and wipe the blood off my mouth.

3695
04:01:25,873 --> 04:01:29,500
MATT: "Sorry." He grabs the dagger from the
ground--

3696
04:01:29,500 --> 04:01:30,941
LIAM: Is she next to him?

3697
04:01:30,941 --> 04:01:33,675
MARISHA: No, he's going to kill me.

3698
04:01:33,675 --> 04:01:36,223
LIAM: Right next to her?

3699
04:01:36,223 --> 04:01:40,726
MATT: He takes the dagger, rears back with it, and
flings it to the side toward Orthax.

3700
04:01:40,726 --> 04:01:43,008
(cheering)

3701
04:01:43,008 --> 04:01:52,438
MATT: That is 16, which hits him. Just barely,
actually! Orthax technically is next to you, so he

3702
04:01:52,438 --> 04:02:10,867
does get sneak attack. Okay. 23 points of damage to
Orthax, and Kynan travels with the blade right

3703
04:02:10,867 --> 04:02:19,764
next to him. He throws the blade, then vanishes in
a puff of smoke, then he appears right where it

3704
04:02:19,764 --> 04:02:21,469
landed with the blade in his hand.

3705
04:02:21,469 --> 04:02:23,670
LAURA: How did he get-- oh, that's Whisper.

3706
04:02:23,670 --> 04:02:36,221
LIAM: I'm going to attack now. First one is a 17.
Second one is a 28. So first one, with sneak

3707
04:02:36,221 --> 04:02:54,071
attack damage, is (counting) 38 for the first.
And second one is ten. So 48 in total.

3708
04:02:54,071 --> 04:03:02,088
MATT: You slam both blades into the side of
Orthax, and the form itself, the shadow's

3709
04:03:02,088 --> 04:03:08,758
sparking. The sunlight is scarring and pocking the
back of this oily surface that is its muscled

3710
04:03:08,758 --> 04:03:16,126
shoulder. Each blade strike that hits, you can see
black shadow pouring out like a small waterfall of

3711
04:03:16,126 --> 04:03:24,335
pure void. Orthax is like (pained growling). Each
damage he takes, his head doesn't turn, his face

3712
04:03:24,335 --> 04:03:30,795
still locked in pure hatred and vengeance toward
Percival. End of your turn, Vax? Oh yeah, because

3713
04:03:30,795 --> 04:03:33,040
that was your reaction. Scanlan, you're up.

3714
04:03:33,040 --> 04:03:40,448
SAM: Can I gingerly walk on the glass?

3715
04:03:40,448 --> 04:03:43,204
MATT: You can move three squares and not take any
damage.

3716
04:03:43,204 --> 04:03:45,769
SAM: Will that be where she was when she
disappeared?

3717
04:03:45,769 --> 04:03:48,234
MATT: She was right here, around there. You can go
there.

3718
04:03:48,234 --> 04:03:50,954
SAM: I'm going to go gingerly there, where she
was.

3719
04:03:50,954 --> 04:03:52,630
MATT: Carefully step away. All right.

3720
04:03:52,630 --> 04:04:01,984
SAM: I draw my blade, get it ready to rock, and
inspire--

3721
04:04:01,984 --> 04:04:06,933
LAURA: Oh! I can't say anything, can I?

3722
04:04:06,933 --> 04:04:08,851
TALIESIN: Sadly.

3723
04:04:08,851 --> 04:04:13,265
SAM: I'm going to inspire myself, because I'm a
selfish motherfuck.

3724
04:04:13,265 --> 04:04:14,775
(laughter)

3725
04:04:14,775 --> 04:04:19,125
MATT: You can add an inspiration die to an ability
check; you don't actually inspire yourself.

3726
04:04:19,125 --> 04:04:21,151
SAM: You can't inspire yourself?

3727
04:04:21,151 --> 04:04:24,196
MATT: No! You are inspiring to yourself at all
times.

3728
04:04:24,196 --> 04:04:28,581
SAM: That is true. Well, then I will inspire
Grog.

3729
04:04:28,581 --> 04:04:30,577
TALIESIN: That's fair.

3730
04:04:30,577 --> 04:04:34,922
TRAVIS: Are you going to talk about how the
Redskins lost to the Cowboys this last weekend?

3731
04:04:34,922 --> 04:04:45,874
SAM: I'm sorry, who? A Washington team, whose name
I dare not say? I'll inspire you with a dad joke.

3732
04:04:45,874 --> 04:04:49,326
It's another cow one.

3733
04:04:49,326 --> 04:04:50,901
TRAVIS: Oh, good.

3734
04:04:50,901 --> 04:04:52,388
SAM: Why did the cow want to go to Hollywood?

3735
04:04:52,388 --> 04:04:53,122
TRAVIS: Why?

3736
04:04:53,122 --> 04:04:54,124
SAM: He wanted to be in--

3737
04:04:54,124 --> 04:04:55,806
TALIESIN AND MARISHA: Moo-vies!

3738
04:04:55,806 --> 04:05:01,133
LAURA: That's really good. That's really funny.
Just hilarious.

3739
04:05:01,133 --> 04:05:03,574
TALIESIN: That's two moo jokes, I might add.

3740
04:05:03,574 --> 04:05:08,849
SAM: I'm ready. I'm holding my action until she
reappears.

3741
04:05:08,849 --> 04:05:15,281
MATT: Ending your turn, that brings us to Orthax.
Orthax, glaring intently, is going to move his

3742
04:05:15,281 --> 04:05:17,205
Mark of Vengeance as a bonus action to you,
Percy.

3743
04:05:17,205 --> 04:05:18,822
TRAVIS: What? I am offended.

3744
04:05:18,822 --> 04:05:21,804
MATT: He's going to step forward.

3745
04:05:21,804 --> 04:05:25,407
TALIESIN: Attacks of opportunity?

3746
04:05:25,407 --> 04:05:28,133
MATT: From Vax, who is not here.

3747
04:05:28,133 --> 04:05:33,624
TALIESIN: Vax ran to the bathroom. Also, doesn't
technically the young squire get an attack of

3748
04:05:33,624 --> 04:05:34,714
opportunity?

3749
04:05:34,714 --> 04:05:39,804
MATT: He's still in melee. Do you want to go ahead
and roll an attack for Vax?

3750
04:05:39,804 --> 04:05:41,475
SAM: Yes! That would be hilarious!

3751
04:05:41,475 --> 04:05:42,437
TALIESIN: I trust you.

3752
04:05:42,437 --> 04:05:43,594
MATT: Go for it.

3753
04:05:43,594 --> 04:05:45,114
SAM: That's not the dice he rolls for attacks!

3754
04:05:45,114 --> 04:05:46,593
(laughter)

3755
04:05:46,593 --> 04:05:48,301
TRAVIS: He rolls the spiky fucker.

3756
04:05:48,301 --> 04:05:51,139
LAURA: 21.

3757
04:05:51,139 --> 04:05:54,536
MATT: That hits. Roll 1d4 plus whatever his bonus
to one of his daggers is.

3758
04:05:54,536 --> 04:05:57,780
TALIESIN: I hope he kills Orthax and isn't even
here.

3759
04:05:57,780 --> 04:05:59,316
LAURA: Ten?

3760
04:05:59,316 --> 04:06:05,532
MATT: All right. Ten damage to Orthax. He takes
the hit and keeps walking forward, straight toward

3761
04:06:05,532 --> 04:06:13,985
you. As it walks up, takes both its claws back and
unleashes on you, Percy. It would have

3762
04:06:13,985 --> 04:06:17,100
disadvantage in the sunlight, but the mark gives
it advantage, so it's a basic attack against you.

3763
04:06:17,100 --> 04:06:21,325
That is 18 plus nine.

3764
04:06:21,325 --> 04:06:25,769
TALIESIN: 18 plus nine to hit?! Wow, does that
hit. That's crazy!

3765
04:06:25,769 --> 04:06:30,413
MATT: And the other one is a 14 plus nine.

3766
04:06:30,413 --> 04:06:37,057
TALIESIN: That's a 23 to hit. Of course that hits,
as well! Just unconscious again.

3767
04:06:37,057 --> 04:06:44,114
MATT: So the first hit is 2d8-- no, 4d8 because he
has advantage on you-- no, he doesn't have

3768
04:06:44,114 --> 04:06:45,268
advantage!

3769
04:06:45,268 --> 04:06:48,995
SAM: You delivered ten points of damage while you
were gone.

3770
04:06:48,995 --> 04:06:50,171
LIAM: I'm so cool.

3771
04:06:50,171 --> 04:06:51,919
TALIESIN: You stealthed that hard.

3772
04:06:51,919 --> 04:06:54,338
MATT: 21 points of psychic damage.

3773
04:06:54,338 --> 04:06:57,336
TALIESIN: I'm out again.

3774
04:06:57,336 --> 04:06:58,590
MATT: You're out?

3775
04:06:58,590 --> 04:07:00,579
MARISHA: Fucking fuck, this is not good, guys.

3776
04:07:00,579 --> 04:07:03,068
TALIESIN: It's a slash attack?

3777
04:07:03,068 --> 04:07:04,034
MATT: Yes.

3778
04:07:04,034 --> 04:07:05,580
TALIESIN: All right. 21 points.

3779
04:07:05,580 --> 04:07:08,312
MATT: Second strike hits you. Two death saving
throws.

3780
04:07:08,312 --> 04:07:09,922
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

3781
04:07:09,922 --> 04:07:13,195
TALIESIN: It's a crit within five feet?

3782
04:07:13,195 --> 04:07:16,638
MATT: It's a melee attack within five feet, and
you're unconscious. It's two death saving throws.

3783
04:07:16,638 --> 04:07:18,547
LIAM: Yep. Been there, done that.

3784
04:07:18,547 --> 04:07:21,532
MARISHA: Come on, Percy. Big money, no whammies.

3785
04:07:21,532 --> 04:07:27,053
MATT: That ends Orthax's turn. Percy, it's your
turn. Roll a death saving throw.

3786
04:07:27,053 --> 04:07:29,011
SAM: Oh shit!

3787
04:07:29,011 --> 04:07:31,425
LAURA: Oh no!

3788
04:07:31,425 --> 04:07:33,693
MARISHA: Wait, is this it?

3789
04:07:33,693 --> 04:07:35,303
TRAVIS: Come on.

3790
04:07:35,303 --> 04:07:37,124
LIAM: Golden snitch.

3791
04:07:37,124 --> 04:07:42,694
TALIESIN: Ten. I don't remember!

3792
04:07:42,694 --> 04:07:44,384
MATT: I believe that is not a failure.

3793
04:07:44,384 --> 04:07:49,290
TRAVIS: I think it's ten or higher, right? Are you
shitting me? You rolled a fucking ten?

3794
04:07:49,290 --> 04:07:50,701
MARISHA: It was on the money.

3795
04:07:50,701 --> 04:07:52,008
MATT: Yep, ten or higher you succeed!

3796
04:07:52,008 --> 04:07:56,119
(screaming)

3797
04:07:56,119 --> 04:08:01,491
TALIESIN: Guys, let me say I have the coolest
character lined up, but okay.

3798
04:08:01,491 --> 04:08:08,526
TRAVIS: Can I see Scanlan prepare for the bamf,
and can I move to the other side of the last place

3799
04:08:08,526 --> 04:08:09,928
I saw her?

3800
04:08:09,928 --> 04:08:11,709
MATT: Scanlan is standing where she was last
time.

3801
04:08:11,709 --> 04:08:13,663
TRAVIS: Okay, can I move opposite of him?

3802
04:08:13,663 --> 04:08:14,901
MATT: Over here?

3803
04:08:14,901 --> 04:08:22,197
TRAVIS: Maybe a little bit further. Yeah, and turn
toward that space, and I'll hold my action until I

3804
04:08:22,197 --> 04:08:25,591
see her. Bitch.

3805
04:08:25,591 --> 04:08:36,355
MATT: All right, so it is now her turn. She is
going to appear right there.

3806
04:08:36,355 --> 04:08:37,669
SAM: Stab, stab, stab!

3807
04:08:37,669 --> 04:08:40,618
MATT: Just out of reach of both of you.

3808
04:08:40,618 --> 04:08:41,958
SAM: Are you fucking kidding me?

3809
04:08:41,958 --> 04:08:43,243
MARISHA: What?

3810
04:08:43,243 --> 04:08:47,247
MATT: This is a five-foot melee attack, and she's
just out of range of both of you guys.

3811
04:08:47,247 --> 04:08:49,155
SAM: I'm throwing my sword!

3812
04:08:49,155 --> 04:08:53,778
MARISHA: She's bamfing, is that what she's doing?

3813
04:08:53,778 --> 04:08:56,961
MATT: When she bamfed out, the axe fell to the
ground, and you pulled it back in. Do you make

3814
04:08:56,961 --> 04:08:58,084
your throw attack?

3815
04:08:58,084 --> 04:09:01,325
TRAVIS: Yes! Reckless, great weapon master.

3816
04:09:01,325 --> 04:09:02,500
TALIESIN: This will kill me, by the way.

3817
04:09:02,500 --> 04:09:05,517
LIAM: Grog! Oh, Grog!

3818
04:09:05,517 --> 04:09:08,466
MARISHA: Come on, Grog! Come on!

3819
04:09:08,466 --> 04:09:12,904
TRAVIS: That giant number again. That's 32 minus
five. 28. We're good.

3820
04:09:12,904 --> 04:09:15,622
MARISHA: Kill her.

3821
04:09:15,622 --> 04:09:18,693
TALIESIN: Everything you've got.

3822
04:09:18,693 --> 04:09:20,071
MARISHA: Grog, kill her.

3823
04:09:20,071 --> 04:09:22,647
TRAVIS: 32.

3824
04:09:22,647 --> 04:09:29,297
MATT: 32 points of damage. As she appears, you
throw the axe, and it's a very short distance, so

3825
04:09:29,297 --> 04:09:34,497
a big amount of your physical strength is put
behind it. The axe embeds itself right in her

3826
04:09:34,497 --> 04:09:40,547
upper abdomen, and she's like, (groaning). It's
still in her right now, and she's, "No."

3827
04:09:40,547 --> 04:09:44,431
SAM: I'm throwing my sword.

3828
04:09:44,431 --> 04:09:46,496
MATT: You're going to throw?

3829
04:09:46,496 --> 04:09:47,685
SAM: Yeah!

3830
04:09:47,685 --> 04:09:49,431
MATT: All right, roll with disadvantage.

3831
04:09:49,431 --> 04:09:54,715
SAM: I have advantage on my attack because I just
inspired. Mythcarver.

3832
04:09:54,715 --> 04:09:58,523
MATT: Mythcarver? Yeah, but you'll have
disadvantage, so it's your regular attack with no

3833
04:09:58,523 --> 04:10:03,514
proficiency bonus. You're not proficient at
throwing weapons, so this is a serious penalty.

3834
04:10:03,514 --> 04:10:06,612
MARISHA: Can you inspire yourself? Have you done
that yet?

3835
04:10:06,612 --> 04:10:08,051
TALIESIN: No, he can't really do it.

3836
04:10:08,051 --> 04:10:10,994
MARISHA and LIAM: Tilt!

3837
04:10:10,994 --> 04:10:13,115
MATT: What did you roll?

3838
04:10:13,115 --> 04:10:14,337
SAM: 13.

3839
04:10:14,337 --> 04:10:21,553
MATT: That's not going to do it. You throw the
blade, and it whips past her. As she appears, she

3840
04:10:21,553 --> 04:10:32,677
takes one step, two steps there past Grog, sees
Orthax whaling on the corpse of Percy. "And that's

3841
04:10:32,677 --> 04:10:38,744
"another name off the list." And fires.

3842
04:10:38,744 --> 04:10:44,534
SAM: Can I do Cutting Words? Has a whole round
gone by since my last reaction?

3843
04:10:44,534 --> 04:10:46,766
LAURA: It has!

3844
04:10:46,766 --> 04:10:49,891
MATT: Yeah, we can get to that. We'll see what she
rolls.

3845
04:10:49,891 --> 04:10:51,628
TALIESIN: Wow.

3846
04:10:51,628 --> 04:10:53,462
TRAVIS: (laughing) I mean, I don't know.

3847
04:10:53,462 --> 04:10:55,382
TALIESIN: Am I the first one to go?

3848
04:10:55,382 --> 04:10:56,819
MARISHA: Shut up!

3849
04:10:56,819 --> 04:11:01,191
MATT: You're technically prone, so she has
disadvantage.

3850
04:11:01,191 --> 04:11:02,987
TALIESIN: I'm prone, and I'm in shadow.

3851
04:11:02,987 --> 04:11:10,848
MATT: So that is a 15-- no, 13. 13 plus 14. 27.

3852
04:11:10,848 --> 04:11:13,468
TALIESIN: With Cutting Words?

3853
04:11:13,468 --> 04:11:18,249
SAM: I'm going to reduce her attack. 27?

3854
04:11:18,249 --> 04:11:21,183
MATT: Roll a d10 and reduce her attack by a d10.

3855
04:11:21,183 --> 04:11:22,448
TALIESIN: Roll a d10!

3856
04:11:22,448 --> 04:11:25,448
MARISHA: You have to roll a ten!

3857
04:11:25,448 --> 04:11:33,437
TALIESIN: Well, no. Do I still have my cover
bonus? It is a giant mess in there.

3858
04:11:33,437 --> 04:11:36,694
SAM: Does he have cover like he did before?

3859
04:11:36,694 --> 04:11:38,934
MATT: No, he is prone, and that's given the
disadvantage.

3860
04:11:38,934 --> 04:11:43,942
TALIESIN: So you have to roll a ten. This is
adorable.

3861
04:11:43,942 --> 04:11:47,423
SAM: Why is this on me, guys?!

3862
04:11:47,423 --> 04:11:49,313
Two.

3863
04:11:49,313 --> 04:11:57,102
MATT: Two. The bullet sinks into Percy. You hear
the air escape from his lungs as Orthax suddenly

3864
04:11:57,102 --> 04:12:02,460
flares up with darkness. You watch as the edges of
the barrel, some sort of script that was carved on

3865
04:12:02,460 --> 04:12:07,821
the side of one of the barrels flares away with a
purple flash. And it seems like some of Ripley's

3866
04:12:07,821 --> 04:12:29,940
wounds heal a little bit. She goes, "Now, it's
time to make an escape." And she's going to use a

3867
04:12:29,940 --> 04:12:39,001
bonus action to Misty Step that way, and vanish.

3868
04:12:39,001 --> 04:12:41,095
TRAVIS: Is my axe still in her chest?

3869
04:12:41,095 --> 04:12:45,879
MATT: As she runs away, the axe drags a bit behind
her because of the chain. As soon as she vanishes,

3870
04:12:45,879 --> 04:12:52,908
it falls to the ground. That brings us to Vex's
turn.

3871
04:12:52,908 --> 04:12:56,688
MARISHA: Are you down? Are you unconscious?

3872
04:12:56,688 --> 04:13:00,636
TALIESIN: I'm not unconscious. Technically
speaking, that's three.

3873
04:13:00,636 --> 04:13:03,482
MATT: Percy is now devoid of life.

3874
04:13:03,482 --> 04:13:09,633
LAURA: Can you do anything as a paladin? Can you
do anything?

3875
04:13:09,633 --> 04:13:13,250
LIAM: Whose turn is it?

3876
04:13:13,250 --> 04:13:42,689
LAURA: It's my turn. Trinket's in the necklace. I
don't know. I don't know what I can do... I think I'll--

3877
04:13:42,689 --> 04:13:45,548
SAM: Kill Orthax.

3878
04:13:45,548 --> 04:13:50,840
MARISHA: Kill Orthax. That's literally your best
bet right now.

3879
04:13:50,840 --> 04:13:55,682
TALIESIN: Can you do something about this? This is
necessary at the moment. Do you have nothing?

3880
04:13:55,682 --> 04:14:00,010
MARISHA: Even if I had something, I couldn't do
it.

3881
04:14:00,010 --> 04:14:04,842
LAURA: I just scream. I scream, and I start
shooting arrows at Orthax.

3882
04:14:04,842 --> 04:14:06,672
MATT: Go for it. Roll two attacks.

3883
04:14:06,672 --> 04:14:10,588
TALIESIN: Can you do something with that? Okay,
never mind, then.

3884
04:14:10,588 --> 04:14:18,497
LAURA: Ashley's asking to bamf in. Would she have
felt anything because her necklace went off? That

3885
04:14:18,497 --> 04:14:20,775
hits him for sure. 15 plus 18.

3886
04:14:20,775 --> 04:14:25,304
MARISHA: Ashley's texting quite a lot right now.

3887
04:14:25,304 --> 04:14:27,176
TALIESIN: I'm not looking. I don't want to look.

3888
04:14:27,176 --> 04:14:29,330
LAURA: 21 on the second hit.

3889
04:14:29,330 --> 04:14:30,721
MATT: Both hit. Roll damage.

3890
04:14:30,721 --> 04:14:45,365
LAURA: 19. Four is lightning damage.

3891
04:14:45,365 --> 04:14:47,375
MATT: All right.

3892
04:14:47,375 --> 04:14:49,185
LAURA: And 17. One is lightning damage.

3893
04:14:49,185 --> 04:14:53,003
MATT: Okay. You going to stay where you are up in
the tree?

3894
04:14:53,003 --> 04:15:04,000
LAURA: No, I want to fly over closer to Percy on
the other side of the tree.

3895
04:15:04,000 --> 04:15:05,425
MATT: You fly down this side?

3896
04:15:05,425 --> 04:15:06,372
LAURA: Yeah.

3897
04:15:06,372 --> 04:15:10,867
MATT: Okay. That ends your turn. Vax, you're up.

3898
04:15:10,867 --> 04:15:16,129
LAURA: And I release Trinket.

3899
04:15:16,129 --> 04:15:21,721
MATT: Trinket is currently unconscious in your
necklace.

3900
04:15:21,721 --> 04:15:26,026
LIAM: I'm going to attack Orthax. He's got people
around him, yeah?

3901
04:15:26,026 --> 04:15:27,868
MATT: Currently, yes.

3902
04:15:27,868 --> 04:15:31,612
LAURA: Oh, did I get sneak attack on Orthax?

3903
04:15:31,612 --> 04:15:35,096
MATT: Yeah, because he's in melee, so roll a sneak
attack on that. 2d6 to that.

3904
04:15:35,096 --> 04:15:38,762
LAURA: Eight. Eight more.

3905
04:15:38,762 --> 04:15:44,881
MATT: Okay, that's eight. All righty. Vax?

3906
04:15:44,881 --> 04:15:48,371
LIAM: I'm going to use Sharpshooter on this
attack.

3907
04:15:48,371 --> 04:15:50,636
MATT: Okay.

3908
04:15:50,636 --> 04:15:56,009
LIAM: That's a one, so that misses. I'm not going
to use Sharpshooter on the next one. That is a

3909
04:15:56,009 --> 04:15:57,179
24.

3910
04:15:57,179 --> 04:15:59,355
MATT: 24. Roll for sneak attack.

3911
04:15:59,355 --> 04:16:10,692
LIAM: (counting) 31.

3912
04:16:10,692 --> 04:16:13,887
MATT: 31 damage.

3913
04:16:13,887 --> 04:16:19,470
LIAM: And I'm going to use-- shit. No, I'm not.
Where's Trinket?

3914
04:16:19,470 --> 04:16:21,130
LAURA: He's in the necklace.

3915
04:16:21,130 --> 04:16:23,041
LIAM: In the necklace? I'm going to stay put.

3916
04:16:23,041 --> 04:16:25,723
MATT: Okay. Ending Vax's turn. Keyleth, you're
up.

3917
04:16:25,723 --> 04:16:42,069
MARISHA: Oh fuck. Oh Jesus. (groans) How close is
Orthax to me?

3918
04:16:42,069 --> 04:16:44,505
MATT: Orthax is right in front of you.

3919
04:16:44,505 --> 04:17:00,033
MARISHA: Seeing Percy fall, all I have left is
Thunderwave, and I'm going to do it at 5th-level

3920
04:17:00,033 --> 04:17:02,522
because that's all I have left.

3921
04:17:02,522 --> 04:17:14,060
MATT: Okay. Thunderwave. Constitution saving
throw. That's a nine, so that's a failure. At

3922
04:17:14,060 --> 04:17:18,251
5th-level? That's an additional 4d8, so that's 6d8
thunder damage.

3923
04:17:18,251 --> 04:17:42,755
MARISHA: I rolled all sevens. So seven, 14, 21. Oh
shit! What did I say? 21 plus another eight, which

3924
04:17:42,755 --> 04:17:54,232
is 29, plus another eight, which is 37. Plus
another six, which is 43 points of thunder damage.

3925
04:17:54,232 --> 04:17:58,357
MATT: As you turn back out of frustration and
blast forth this wave of thunderous energy, you

3926
04:17:58,357 --> 04:18:05,286
watch as Orthax scatters for a second and falls
into this small pile of shadow on the ground that

3927
04:18:05,286 --> 04:18:11,513
is now shifting for some sort of focus, (hissing)
around the ground like a slippery snake. Orthax is

3928
04:18:11,513 --> 04:18:18,110
essentially at zero hit points. That ends
Keyleth's turn. Scanlan, you're up.

3929
04:18:18,110 --> 04:18:21,284
SAM: I walk over and pick up my sword slowly.

3930
04:18:21,284 --> 04:18:26,193
MATT: Okay. You take five points of piercing
damage to go over and get it.

3931
04:18:26,193 --> 04:18:28,027
SAM: Even gingerly?

3932
04:18:28,027 --> 04:18:29,941
MATT: Gingerly, you can't quite get to your
sword.

3933
04:18:29,941 --> 04:18:36,058
SAM: And hold my attack in case maybe she bamfs
back.

3934
04:18:36,058 --> 04:18:37,399
MATT: You can hold a spell, too, if you want.

3935
04:18:37,399 --> 04:18:38,563
SAM: I'm holding a spell.

3936
04:18:38,563 --> 04:18:39,980
MATT: What spell are you holding?

3937
04:18:39,980 --> 04:18:45,593
SAM: I think she's resistant to it, but I will
hold Otiluke's Resilient Sphere.

3938
04:18:45,593 --> 04:18:52,913
MATT: Okay. All right, that ends your turn. Back
up at the top. Grog.

3939
04:18:52,913 --> 04:18:58,988
TRAVIS: I go and get my axe, because I'm still
raging!

3940
04:18:58,988 --> 04:19:05,052
MATT: Okay. You pick up the axe right there where
it was on the ground after she vanished.

3941
04:19:05,052 --> 04:19:07,375
TRAVIS: And I hold my action in case she comes
back.

3942
04:19:07,375 --> 04:19:09,948
MATT: Okay. End of your turn, she appears.

3943
04:19:09,948 --> 04:19:11,319
TRAVIS: She does?

3944
04:19:11,319 --> 04:19:12,521
MATT: Yes.

3945
04:19:12,521 --> 04:19:16,876
SAM: I will encapsulate her, or attempt to.

3946
04:19:16,876 --> 04:19:30,658
MATT: Otiluke's Resilient Sphere. All right,
dexterity saving throw against a DC of?

3947
04:19:30,658 --> 04:19:38,022
SAM: 21, with disadvantage, because I Cutting
Words-ed her.

3948
04:19:38,022 --> 04:19:47,789
MATT: That's true. That would be a 16. The sphere
encapsulates her. She is now currently bound

3949
04:19:47,789 --> 04:19:53,744
within the sphere and she looks about suddenly,
going, "What? What the heck is going on?!"

3950
04:19:53,744 --> 04:20:06,041
SAM: You can curse. It's okay; you killed one of
us. Okay. Everyone gather around her.

3951
04:20:06,041 --> 04:20:08,918
LAURA: I'm not leaving Percy.

3952
04:20:08,918 --> 04:20:11,437
SAM: I'm going to drop this thing, and we're all
going to fucking kill her together.

3953
04:20:11,437 --> 04:20:12,375
MARISHA: No.

3954
04:20:12,375 --> 04:20:14,180
LIAM: Yes, we are.

3955
04:20:14,180 --> 04:20:20,950
MATT: She stands there and fires at the wall, and
it has no effect.

3956
04:20:20,950 --> 04:20:26,209
TRAVIS: I have three attacks.

3957
04:20:26,209 --> 04:20:30,819
SAM: I slowly walk up to her with the sword in my
hand.

3958
04:20:30,819 --> 04:20:32,364
LIAM: I'm walking over, as well.

3959
04:20:32,364 --> 04:20:39,899
MATT: Okay. Well, first, at the end of her turn,
the last round of the Blink spell does not go off.

3960
04:20:39,899 --> 04:20:42,439
TRAVIS: The roll didn't happen?

3961
04:20:42,439 --> 04:20:48,629
MATT: Yeah, she didn't blink out, so she's now
locked in the sphere and she's starting to look

3962
04:20:48,629 --> 04:20:55,332
about extremely nervously. The shadow of Orthax
comes and finds her and is beneath the orb and

3963
04:20:55,332 --> 04:20:57,409
can't quite get through.

3964
04:20:57,409 --> 04:21:01,755
SAM: No magic can happen in the orb.

3965
04:21:01,755 --> 04:21:06,123
MATT: You guys all bring yourself towards the
edge?

3966
04:21:06,123 --> 04:21:12,873
LAURA: No, I'm staying. I'm staying next to
Percy. I'll shoot her from a distance!

3967
04:21:12,873 --> 04:21:19,475
MATT: For the sake of brevity, we'll say it comes
back to Scanlan's turn, and everyone's holding

3968
04:21:19,475 --> 04:21:21,087
their action?

3969
04:21:21,087 --> 04:21:22,789
TRAVIS: I'd like to get right up next to the orb.

3970
04:21:22,789 --> 04:21:24,247
MARISHA: I do, as well.

3971
04:21:24,247 --> 04:21:27,017
LAURA: I'm getting up on the log so I can get a
clean shot at her.

3972
04:21:27,017 --> 04:21:36,862
SAM: Vax, you with us?

3973
04:21:36,862 --> 04:21:40,404
LIAM: Yes.

3974
04:21:40,496 --> 04:21:44,329
MATT: Kynan actually walks along with you and
heads up.

3975
04:21:44,329 --> 04:21:48,864
SAM: Ready?

3976
04:21:48,864 --> 04:21:51,512
LIAM: I'm ready.

3977
04:21:51,512 --> 04:21:53,798
TRAVIS: When you are.

3978
04:21:53,798 --> 04:21:55,228
SAM: For Percy.

3979
04:21:55,228 --> 04:21:59,306
MATT: Her hands are on the orb, eyes darting
around. She's trying to think her way out of this.

3980
04:21:59,306 --> 04:22:05,140
You see her face flash in a couple of ways, and
she looks cunningly at all of you and smiles.

3981
04:22:05,140 --> 04:22:12,802
SAM: Percy's killing you right now, not us. I drop
it, and we all attack.

3982
04:22:12,802 --> 04:22:13,636
LIAM: Stab.

3983
04:22:13,636 --> 04:22:14,868
TRAVIS: Obliviate.

3984
04:22:14,868 --> 04:22:23,589
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll, Grog. Roll
your three attacks.

3985
04:22:23,589 --> 04:22:27,407
TRAVIS: Reckless, great, everything.

3986
04:22:27,407 --> 04:22:34,112
MATT: Vex, roll your two attacks. Vax, roll your
attacks. Scanlan.

3987
04:22:34,112 --> 04:22:36,099
TRAVIS: 29.

3988
04:22:36,099 --> 04:22:39,335
LAURA: 26 and 32.

3989
04:22:39,335 --> 04:22:45,266
MARISHA: Goddamn it, Gil, you better not fuck me.
Not bad, Gil. (laughs)

3990
04:22:45,266 --> 04:22:47,423
LIAM: 26 and 22.

3991
04:22:47,423 --> 04:22:51,445
MARISHA: Are we doing melee attacks, or spell
attacks, or what?

3992
04:22:51,445 --> 04:22:56,449
MATT: Spell attacks is fine. She doesn't have a
whole lot of energy left in her engine, and we

3993
04:22:56,449 --> 04:22:58,578
don't even need to roll damage, because:

3994
04:22:58,578 --> 04:23:04,085
How do you, Vox Machina, want to do this?

3995
04:23:04,085 --> 04:23:09,224
LIAM: I want to sink my dagger into her arm, sever
all around her shoulder, and rip her fake arm off

3996
04:23:09,224 --> 04:23:11,134
of her body.

3997
04:23:11,134 --> 04:23:16,970
MATT: (grunts) The arm plummets to the ground, the
shadow still coalescing where the wound is. The

3998
04:23:16,970 --> 04:23:24,711
shadow of Orthax shoots up into where the exposed
wound is. With that moment, who does what next?

3999
04:23:24,711 --> 04:23:28,334
SAM: I'd like to carve the de Rolo crest into her
forehead.

4000
04:23:28,334 --> 04:23:35,325
MATT: As she's clutching this, you reach forward
and grab her by the throat, her eyes wide, and

4001
04:23:35,325 --> 04:23:41,060
slash across. Right now, she has no strength to
resist.

4002
04:23:41,060 --> 04:23:46,434
TRAVIS: I'm going to take the axe and go straight
across her navel.

4003
04:23:46,434 --> 04:23:49,314
MATT: Keyleth?

4004
04:23:49,314 --> 04:23:54,820
MARISHA: I'm going to take a Grasping Vine and
choke her around her throat.

4005
04:23:54,820 --> 04:23:58,587
MATT: The vines wrap around and hold her in place.
Vex?

4006
04:23:58,587 --> 04:24:05,449
LAURA: I want an arrow straight through her heart,
and one in her mouth as she screams.

4007
04:24:05,449 --> 04:24:10,598
MATT: The scream is cut short as the arrow finds
its place in the back of the skull. The other one

4008
04:24:10,598 --> 04:24:15,232
straight to the chest. Grog, your blade cuts
through the midsection as the grasping vine pulls

4009
04:24:15,232 --> 04:24:21,612
the lower half down. Ripley is entirely torn
asunder in a final silent scream. The shadow of

4010
04:24:21,612 --> 04:24:38,173
Orthax dissipates, sputters, and vanishes. The
battlefield grows silent.

4011
04:24:38,173 --> 04:24:42,056
You all turn and look back over your shoulder and
see the still body of Percy against the tree

4012
04:24:42,056 --> 04:24:44,820
trunks over there.

4013
04:24:44,820 --> 04:24:47,728
LAURA: (tearfully) I'm still going to try and cast
Cure Wounds on him.

4014
04:24:47,728 --> 04:24:49,980
MARISHA: (tearfully) I do the same.

4015
04:24:49,980 --> 04:24:59,064
MATT: And that's where we'll pick up next
episode.

4016
04:24:59,064 --> 04:25:01,514
SAM: No. Shit.

4017
04:25:01,514 --> 04:25:04,696
MARISHA: What? Why would you do that to us?

4018
04:25:04,696 --> 04:25:08,930
MATT: It's what they would have done.

4019
04:25:08,930 --> 04:25:10,645
TALIESIN: I'm okay with this.

4020
04:25:10,645 --> 04:25:13,810
MARISHA: I have nothing left.

4021
04:25:13,810 --> 04:25:23,086
TRAVIS: What just happened?

4022
04:25:23,086 --> 04:25:27,714
MARISHA: Wait, is that it? We need to know,
because if that's it, then we've got to go get

4023
04:25:27,714 --> 04:25:30,122
drinks. (laughs) That was our promise.

4024
04:25:30,122 --> 04:25:38,110
MATT: There are certain people that have magical,
divine abilities that have been known to restore

4025
04:25:38,110 --> 04:25:41,215
life. It's happened before to other members of
your party.

4026
04:25:41,215 --> 04:25:46,960
LAURA: How do we get there, though? We're so far
away. You could bamf us through a tree? There's no trees.

4027
04:25:46,960 --> 04:25:48,312
MARISHA: Not today!

4028
04:25:48,312 --> 04:25:50,093
TRAVIS: She's depleted.

4029
04:25:50,093 --> 04:25:52,056
MARISHA: I'm totally depleted until we sleep.

4030
04:25:52,056 --> 04:25:53,645
LAURA: Maybe I could put him in the--

4031
04:25:53,645 --> 04:25:57,526
MARISHA: In the bag of colding?

4032
04:25:57,526 --> 04:26:00,469
LAURA: No, not in the bag of colding.

4033
04:26:00,469 --> 04:26:04,255
TALIESIN: I think Percy would like that. I think
that's very appropriate.

4034
04:26:04,255 --> 04:26:11,033
LAURA: I could put him in the necklace and maybe
stabilize him? I don't know.

4035
04:26:11,033 --> 04:26:12,550
LIAM: You can't stabilize him.

4036
04:26:12,550 --> 04:26:17,644
MARISHA: You're going to make us deal with this
for a fucking week?

4037
04:26:17,644 --> 04:26:24,577
TALIESIN: As the person who is sitting here, I
think that we will see you next week. It is time.

4038
04:26:24,577 --> 04:26:28,977
MARISHA: I've grown a lot of emotional attachment
to this.

4039
04:26:28,977 --> 04:26:32,599
MATT: We can keep going for a bit--

4040
04:26:32,599 --> 04:26:36,304
TALIESIN: No, I need to process.

4041
04:26:36,304 --> 04:26:37,830
MARISHA: What?!

4042
04:26:37,830 --> 04:26:39,631
TALIESIN: Pick this up later.

4043
04:26:39,631 --> 04:26:42,978
LAURA: Ashley just texted. She doesn't work next
Thursday.

4044
04:26:42,978 --> 04:26:46,202
MARISHA: She doesn't work. She is desperately
wanting to get in.

4045
04:26:46,202 --> 04:26:50,160
MATT: Pike would be an individual to talk to about
this.

4046
04:26:50,160 --> 04:26:51,385
MARISHA: Yeah!

4047
04:26:51,385 --> 04:26:56,110
TRAVIS: Well, that went sideways.

4048
04:26:56,110 --> 04:27:03,607
TALIESIN: Yeah. Let's stop this conversation for
now. We'll have more of this conversation later. I

4049
04:27:03,607 --> 04:27:05,989
will not have this conversation online, either,
guys. Sorry.

4050
04:27:05,989 --> 04:27:08,741
MARISHA: Nothing left under a 3rd-level spell. I
have nothing left.

4051
04:27:08,741 --> 04:27:15,661
SAM: Next week, with new Vox Machina member Wil
Wheaton. Thank you for your service, Taliesin.

4052
04:27:15,661 --> 04:27:18,522
MARISHA: Shut up, Sam!

4053
04:27:18,522 --> 04:27:21,094
SAM: Wheaton will be joining us every week.

4054
04:27:21,094 --> 04:27:28,371
TALIESIN: He'll be getting a mohawk. Thank you.
We'll have this talk later.

4055
04:27:28,371 --> 04:27:36,007
MATT: The story will continue next week. Have
hope. Have faith. We'll see what transpires.

4056
04:27:36,007 --> 04:27:41,215
MARISHA: What? We don't have faith at this table!

4057
04:27:41,215 --> 04:27:43,330
LIAM: Some of us do.

4058
04:27:43,330 --> 04:27:45,101
TALIESIN: It's okay, honey.

4059
04:27:45,101 --> 04:27:46,913
MATT: It's fun to be the DM.

4060
04:27:46,913 --> 04:27:49,974
TALIESIN: Thank you, Matt.

4061
04:27:49,974 --> 04:27:59,299
MATT: Good game, good fight. Hard fight. A very
clever foe felled. We'll pick this up next week.

4062
04:27:59,299 --> 04:28:07,337
Have a good night guys. Is it Thursday yet?

4063
04:28:07,337 --> 04:34:22,646
