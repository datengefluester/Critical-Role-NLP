1
00:00:00,037 --> 00:00:05,652
MATT: Cassandra, remembering this, drags her body
through what remnant is there on the ground.

2
00:00:05,652 --> 00:00:10,157
There's a big groove left behind her as she's
being dragged through it. You get to the second

3
00:00:10,157 --> 00:00:17,915
trap that she marked, and you guys make your way
around it. You make your way to where the road

4
00:00:17,915 --> 00:00:22,712
diverges, the one way to the castle, and the one
to the acid pits. And Cassandra heads towards the

5
00:00:22,712 --> 00:00:23,867
acid pits.

6
00:00:23,867 --> 00:00:26,097
LAURA: Cassandra, what are you doing?

7
00:00:26,097 --> 00:00:27,836
TRAVIS: She's throwing them in the acid pits.

8
00:00:27,836 --> 00:00:32,980
MATT: She doesn't look back at you. She just keeps
walking. You follow her for about five minutes.

9
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:40,147
MARISHA: Are we sure this won't make anything bad
happen if we throw a body into the acid pits?

10
00:00:40,147 --> 00:00:42,158
TALIESIN: I think it's fine.

11
00:00:42,158 --> 00:00:43,317
TRAVIS: I think it's acid.

12
00:00:43,317 --> 00:00:44,428
MARISHA: Okay.

13
00:00:44,428 --> 00:00:48,147
MATT: After about five minutes of following her,
the path leads up and then crests, and there is a

14
00:00:48,147 --> 00:00:55,307
room that smells awful. It's similar to the acrid
scent the room was filled with when the acid was

15
00:00:55,307 --> 00:00:58,578
pouring into the room. There's a whole series of
other chemicals and inside, you can see there's a

16
00:00:58,578 --> 00:01:05,328
number of laboratory set-ups near you. You get the
feeling this is probably where a lot of this

17
00:01:05,328 --> 00:01:10,277
particular acidic concoction that was fine-tuned
for this stone of Whitestone was created, or at

18
00:01:10,277 --> 00:01:21,268
least, honed by Ripley. Without a beat, Cassandra
walks up to the edge and just throws Delilah's

19
00:01:21,268 --> 00:01:29,168
body in. (plop, sizzle) Then it disappears beneath
the surface as the hissing, bubbling noise takes

20
00:01:29,168 --> 00:01:34,278
over the silence of the room. She sits there and
just watches it sink.

21
00:01:34,278 --> 00:01:37,449
LAURA: Well?

22
00:01:37,449 --> 00:01:45,131
LIAM: She brought a lot of ill to this world.
Don't feel too bad.

23
00:01:45,131 --> 00:01:47,472
MATT: Cassandra turns back around.

24
00:01:47,472 --> 00:01:50,390
TALIESIN: She was too dangerous to let live.

25
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:58,022
MARISHA: What about you? How do you feel?

26
00:01:58,022 --> 00:01:59,857
SAM: How's that gun barrel of yours?

27
00:01:59,857 --> 00:02:00,998
MARISHA: Yeah.

28
00:02:00,998 --> 00:02:04,068
TALIESIN: I pull out the broken barrel and inspect
it.

29
00:02:04,068 --> 00:02:15,180
MATT: Looking at it, you can see, Delilah's name
is missing from the barrel entirely. Cassandra's

30
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:28,259
name is still on the barrel, and so is Ripley's.

31
00:02:28,369 --> 00:02:33,608
Go ahead and make an investigation check.

32
00:02:33,728 --> 00:02:42,567
TALIESIN: I had some thoughts but yeah. 11.

33
00:02:42,567 --> 00:02:49,679
MATT: Okay. Just looking at it, it looks like the
names are there, emblazoned as to where they were

34
00:02:49,679 --> 00:02:50,838
before.

35
00:02:50,838 --> 00:03:03,200
TALIESIN: I'm going to just take the broken gun
and point it at my sister. What do I feel?

36
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,038
MATT: Currently, nothing.

37
00:03:08,038 --> 00:03:13,529
TALIESIN: I think I'm all right. I think I may be
all right.

38
00:03:13,529 --> 00:03:19,539
SAM: Why don't you toss that thing into the acid just
in case?

39
00:03:19,614 --> 00:03:21,518
TALIESIN: I'm going to do something else.

40
00:03:21,518 --> 00:03:24,899
SAM: Are you going to shoot your sister like you
just pointed your gun at her? What was that

41
00:03:24,899 --> 00:03:26,030
about?

42
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,789
TALIESIN: You were the one who wouldn't give me
the other gun.

43
00:03:27,789 --> 00:03:28,920
SAM: I gave you the other gun.

44
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,680
TALIESIN: I'm going to go over to the little lab
setup. Is there some acid there?

45
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:39,468
MATT: Go ahead and make an intelligence check.

46
00:03:39,468 --> 00:03:43,968
TALIESIN: 17.

47
00:03:43,968 --> 00:03:47,058
MATT: 17? Yeah, a brief look around you can see
there are many different compounds, different

48
00:03:47,058 --> 00:03:51,740
strengths of acid, what a lot of the initial
experimentation was.

49
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:55,782
TALIESIN: I'm going to start trying to scar her
name off the barrel.

50
00:03:55,782 --> 00:04:01,820
MATT: Okay. You take a moment and eventually
manage to scar and dissolve enough of the exterior

51
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,523
of that barrel until the name is no longer
visible.

52
00:04:04,523 --> 00:04:06,128
TALIESIN: I think it's fine.

53
00:04:06,128 --> 00:04:08,390
SAM: (scoffs) You think it's fine?

54
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,370
LAURA: Lovely.

55
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,640
TALIESIN: You're going to have to have some
faith.

56
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,760
SAM: I don't have any faith! Here, we'll make a
deal. I'll let you keep that gun if you give me

57
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,840
the other one.

58
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,700
TALIESIN: No.

59
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,511
(laughter)

60
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:34,953
LAURA: So glad that your smoke monster is
seemingly gone, Percy. That's wonderful news. The

61
00:04:34,953 --> 00:04:42,022
spinning orb of death, however, is still back
there, so we should probably figure out what to do

62
00:04:42,022 --> 00:04:43,550
about that.

63
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:49,530
TALIESIN: Well, I think perhaps we can talk to
Keeper Yennen. Perhaps put together some priests

64
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:53,641
to deal with that. Enlist the help of the entire
town now that there's no longer

65
00:04:53,641 --> 00:04:56,222
a revolution to be fought.

66
00:04:56,222 --> 00:04:57,940
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's a solid plan.

67
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,220
MARISHA: Oh, the revolution.

68
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,749
TALIESIN: We forgot about that.

69
00:05:00,749 --> 00:05:05,932
MARISHA: We should go stop the fighting. Right? We
should probably let them know it's over.

70
00:05:05,932 --> 00:05:07,122
LAURA: Probably.

71
00:05:07,122 --> 00:05:10,700
TRAVIS: Well if they're fighting, wouldn't it mean
it's not over?

72
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,481
MARISHA: Well, I'm sure they don't know that the
Briarwoods are dead.

73
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:19,122
TALIESIN: So perhaps if we tell everyone the
Briarwoods are dead. Cassandra?

74
00:05:19,122 --> 00:05:21,541
TRAVIS: Maybe we'll see Ripley on the way out.

75
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,311
TALIESIN: Wouldn't that be nice?

76
00:05:23,311 --> 00:05:30,580
SAM: I just had a thought, Percy. I cast Friends
on him.

77
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,122
MATT: Okay.

78
00:05:32,122 --> 00:05:36,881
SAM: I think I know how to fix your gun, if you
hand it to me.

79
00:05:36,881 --> 00:05:41,360
TALIESIN: Never in my right mind would I hand my
gun.

80
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:52,093
MATT: Go ahead and make a-- it'd be a persuasion
check. And you go ahead and make an insight check.

81
00:05:52,093 --> 00:05:56,778
But you have an advantage on it. No, he has
advantage on the persuasion, you do not have it.

82
00:05:56,778 --> 00:05:59,571
LIAM: While they're talking, can I attempt to pull
it off of his belt?

83
00:05:59,571 --> 00:06:01,685
MATT: Pull it off of Percy's?

84
00:06:01,685 --> 00:06:05,072
TALIESIN: My insight is 21.

85
00:06:05,072 --> 00:06:07,311
SAM: I rolled a natural 20.

86
00:06:07,311 --> 00:06:11,371
TALIESIN: You are going to cost me so much money.

87
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:16,913
LIAM: I see Scanlan kill it, and I just step
back.

88
00:06:16,913 --> 00:06:23,021
MATT: Okay. You look down at this gnome, and while
he's normally pretty silly and jovial, in this

89
00:06:23,021 --> 00:06:30,672
moment, there's an honest spark of his own
inspiration in his eyes.

90
00:06:30,672 --> 00:06:37,242
TALIESIN: (whimpers) I'm so upset that I have to
do this.

91
00:06:37,242 --> 00:06:39,941
SAM: Wink!

92
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,582
TALIESIN: Going to kill you. I'm going to kill
you.

93
00:06:41,582 --> 00:06:44,362
TRAVIS: You don't know. He's your friend. You're
not mad at all.

94
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,502
TALIESIN: For another three minutes.

95
00:06:46,502 --> 00:06:49,812
LIAM: Yeah, roleplay for three minutes, Taliesin.

96
00:06:49,812 --> 00:06:52,283
TALIESIN: I hand him the broken gun.

97
00:06:52,283 --> 00:06:56,451
MATT: Begrudgingly, you reach out and place it in
his hand and release.

98
00:06:56,451 --> 00:07:06,349
SAM: I say, thank you, Percy. I think, in due
time, you <i>will</i> thank me for this. And I toss it

99
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:12,232
into the acid. As I say, when the spell fades
he's going to be super pissed,

100
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:13,762
somebody protect me!

101
00:07:13,762 --> 00:07:14,795
MARISHA: Okay.

102
00:07:14,795 --> 00:07:15,863
TRAVIS: You want to hop on my shoulders?

103
00:07:15,863 --> 00:07:17,762
SAM: Yes. I go run and jump on Grog's
shoulders.

104
00:07:17,762 --> 00:07:25,153
MATT: As you watch it arc forward, in your head,
you're like, "That fucking gnome." The spell

105
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:32,413
fades, you hear him say that, and just as it
(plop, sizzle).

106
00:07:32,413 --> 00:07:34,372
TRAVIS: You're not going to get that, are you?

107
00:07:34,372 --> 00:07:36,293
TALIESIN: I reach in to try and grab it out.

108
00:07:36,293 --> 00:07:38,804
LAURA: No, Percy! And I reach out and I grab his
hands.

109
00:07:38,804 --> 00:07:40,188
TRAVIS: He threw it! You threw it, though, right?

110
00:07:40,188 --> 00:07:41,363
TALIESIN: No, he dropped it!

111
00:07:41,363 --> 00:07:43,635
MATT: He lobbed it. It wasn't a huge throw.

112
00:07:43,635 --> 00:07:45,133
MARISHA: I cast Hold Person at 3rd level.

113
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:46,144
MATT: On?

114
00:07:46,144 --> 00:07:46,903
MARISHA: Percy!

115
00:07:46,903 --> 00:07:48,502
LAURA: As I reach up and I grab his hands as
well!

116
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:50,467
TALIESIN: That was so expensive!

117
00:07:50,467 --> 00:07:53,733
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw with advantage.

118
00:07:53,733 --> 00:07:55,115
MARISHA: Son of a fuck.

119
00:07:55,115 --> 00:07:57,583
MATT: Heroes' Feast, workin' against you!

120
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,720
LIAM: You're the lord of Castle Whitestone.

121
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,537
TALIESIN: Wisdom saving throw?

122
00:08:01,537 --> 00:08:02,355
MATT: Yes.

123
00:08:02,355 --> 00:08:04,822
TALIESIN: 18.

124
00:08:04,822 --> 00:08:06,172
MATT: What's your DC?

125
00:08:06,172 --> 00:08:08,364
MARISHA: My difficulty class? 18.

126
00:08:08,364 --> 00:08:11,342
MATT: You're like, "That cost a-- (cracking)"

127
00:08:11,342 --> 00:08:18,041
MARISHA: (laughs) I always fail rolls against
Percy! It sucks!

128
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:23,124
MATT: A few moments pass. You don't even see it
beneath the surface now. You just see a little bit

129
00:08:23,124 --> 00:08:28,732
of some fume released from whatever slow process
is dissolving your gun.

130
00:08:28,732 --> 00:08:35,517
LAURA: I step in front as he's unconscious and I
go, Percy, dear. You'll thank us for this later,

131
00:08:35,517 --> 00:08:36,483
I know it.

132
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:38,264
TALIESIN: He's paying for a new one.

133
00:08:38,264 --> 00:08:40,993
LAURA: I kiss his cheek and say, I'm so sorry.

134
00:08:40,993 --> 00:08:42,814
TALIESIN: He's paying for a new one.

135
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,574
MARISHA: We'll get you a new one, Percy.

136
00:08:44,574 --> 00:08:48,234
TALIESIN: I'm going to have to-- oh god!

137
00:08:48,234 --> 00:08:54,003
MATT: As you're watching this, from the fume, a
small plume of black smoke goes (whoosh).

138
00:08:54,003 --> 00:08:55,114
LAURA and MARISHA: See?

139
00:08:55,114 --> 00:08:58,914
MATT: And that cold nugget in the center of your
chest is gone.

140
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:02,863
(cheering)

141
00:09:02,863 --> 00:09:04,364
LAURA: It feels good, doesn't it?!

142
00:09:04,364 --> 00:09:05,685
MARISHA: Doesn't it feel good?

143
00:09:05,685 --> 00:09:07,164
TRAVIS: You fucking genius!

144
00:09:07,164 --> 00:09:08,404
LAURA: It feels good!

145
00:09:08,404 --> 00:09:11,964
(laughter)

146
00:09:11,964 --> 00:09:13,914
TALIESIN: It was so expensive.

147
00:09:13,914 --> 00:09:15,537
TRAVIS: Aw, come on!

148
00:09:15,537 --> 00:09:18,227
TALIESIN: Oh, just throw the carpet in there now,
why don't you?

149
00:09:18,227 --> 00:09:21,244
MARISHA: Oh, Percival, that hurts.

150
00:09:21,244 --> 00:09:25,363
MATT: Cassandra steps up to you and takes your
head in her hands and forces you to look at her

151
00:09:25,363 --> 00:09:34,243
and goes, "Brother. We've all made sacrifices for
this." She slaps you.

152
00:09:34,243 --> 00:09:36,225
TALIESIN: (yelps)

153
00:09:36,225 --> 00:09:41,335
MATT: Oh! That's a 21. 19 plus two.

154
00:09:41,335 --> 00:09:42,663
SAM: He's held right now.

155
00:09:42,663 --> 00:09:44,734
MARISHA: Still holding him in place.

156
00:09:44,734 --> 00:09:49,069
LIAM: I hold my fist way up high to Scanlan on
Grog's shoulder for a silent

157
00:09:49,069 --> 00:09:50,943
little exploding fist bump.

158
00:09:50,943 --> 00:09:56,835
MATT: And she looks to you and goes-- Cassandra
gives you a look to--

159
00:09:56,835 --> 00:09:59,165
TALIESIN: You were never Mother's favorite.

160
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:01,137
SAM: Let's not be petty.

161
00:10:01,137 --> 00:10:02,466
TALIESIN: She told me!

162
00:10:02,466 --> 00:10:04,085
SAM: Let's not be petty, Percy.

163
00:10:04,085 --> 00:10:07,165
MARISHA: You sure you want to let him go? You
sure? Did you hear what he just said to you?

164
00:10:07,165 --> 00:10:08,012
You sure?

165
00:10:08,012 --> 00:10:10,097
MATT: It came out as (muffled angry sounds).

166
00:10:10,097 --> 00:10:13,376
MARISHA: I let it go.

167
00:10:13,376 --> 00:10:17,926
MATT: Okay, your muscle control comes back to you
and Cassandra is holding your freshly slapped

168
00:10:17,926 --> 00:10:25,106
face, gives you a look and goes, "Brother. Let's go to our
people. Let's tell them that for the first time in

169
00:10:25,156 --> 00:10:26,837
"five years Whitestone is free."

170
00:10:26,837 --> 00:10:29,708
TALIESIN: Oh god. Yeah. I'm letting it go.

171
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:33,676
MATT: She reaches over and she takes your arm in
her arm.

172
00:10:33,676 --> 00:10:35,346
TALIESIN: Oh god.

173
00:10:35,346 --> 00:10:39,307
MATT: She takes your arm in her arm and begins
walking both of you back towards the tunnels.

174
00:10:39,307 --> 00:10:47,826
TALIESIN: That one was enchanted. Okay. Two
enchantments. Yeah, all right.

175
00:10:47,826 --> 00:10:52,776
MATT: And with that, we're going to go ahead and take a
quick bathroom break. Meet you guys back here in a

176
00:10:52,806 --> 00:10:53,893
few minutes.

177
00:10:53,893 --> 00:10:54,976
MARISHA: But you're still alive!

178
00:10:54,976 --> 00:10:56,384
TALIESIN: I'm not alive!

179
00:10:56,384 --> 00:10:58,157
LAURA: You're not controlled anymore!

180
00:10:58,157 --> 00:20:16,461
[break]

181
00:20:16,522 --> 00:20:23,050
MATT: Welcome back, folks! So. Let's go ahead and
pick up where we left off. So, as you guys return

182
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:31,169
to the undercroft of Whitestone, Cassandra
carrying you, arm in arm. You make your way up

183
00:20:31,169 --> 00:20:40,610
through the stairs to the main base floor of
Castle Whitestone. Are you guys heading towards

184
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:43,771
your-- where are you heading from here?

185
00:20:43,771 --> 00:20:47,901
MARISHA: I'm going to head straight for the front
door and look in-- is there a balcony on top?

186
00:20:47,901 --> 00:20:51,150
MATT: You can check for the second floor if you
want to.

187
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,818
LAURA: Overviews the city?

188
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:59,061
MATT: You have a pretty high view. It's already
elevated on this platform, so even from a ground-floor

189
00:20:59,061 --> 00:21:01,832
area you can look down into the city.

190
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:03,024
TRAVIS: Front door.

191
00:21:03,024 --> 00:21:07,404
MATT: Front door? All right, Grog walks up to the
front door, being careful of the scattered

192
00:21:07,404 --> 00:21:12,584
caltrops you guys left there. The door is still
ajar from where you left it. As you step out and

193
00:21:12,584 --> 00:21:21,843
look into the daylight, and it's at this point
now, probably mid-afternoon, pushing into evening.

194
00:21:21,843 --> 00:21:26,774
You guys have been traveling underground for quite
some time and taken a few short rests, and have

195
00:21:26,774 --> 00:21:30,073
had a lot of conflict and things happen. So you
started at the start of the day. You're now

196
00:21:30,073 --> 00:21:34,192
pushing into towards dusk. But as you open up and
look outside, with what daylight is still there,

197
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:45,505
you see little plumes of smoke coming from the far
city. Down the pathway that leads up to Castle

198
00:21:45,505 --> 00:21:56,585
Whitestone, you see about 70 to 100 armored
humanoids marching up towards the front of the

199
00:21:56,585 --> 00:21:57,813
castle.

200
00:21:57,813 --> 00:21:59,304
SAM: Humanoids?

201
00:21:59,304 --> 00:22:00,635
MATT: Bipedal.

202
00:22:00,635 --> 00:22:03,113
TRAVIS: Can I pick up my caltrops?

203
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:05,247
MATT: You begin to pick up your caltrops.

204
00:22:05,247 --> 00:22:10,653
LAURA: I know what this is.

205
00:22:10,653 --> 00:22:12,192
TRAVIS: Well, they're good guys.

206
00:22:12,192 --> 00:22:14,554
SAM: No, it could be an undead army.

207
00:22:14,554 --> 00:22:15,976
MATT: Make a perception check.

208
00:22:15,976 --> 00:22:19,634
LAURA: I know what this is. Do I need roll
perception if I know what it is?

209
00:22:19,634 --> 00:22:21,154
MARISHA: Yeah, I was going to say.

210
00:22:21,154 --> 00:22:23,355
TRAVIS: Wow! 19 minus...

211
00:22:23,355 --> 00:22:24,547
MARISHA: 20.

212
00:22:24,547 --> 00:22:25,672
TALIESIN: 27.

213
00:22:25,672 --> 00:22:26,846
SAM: Five.

214
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:27,845
LAURA: 15.

215
00:22:27,845 --> 00:22:31,443
MATT: All right. As you guys get your weapons at
the ready--

216
00:22:31,443 --> 00:22:33,534
TALIESIN: 25, sorry. Did the math wrong.

217
00:22:33,534 --> 00:22:45,026
MATT: 25, okay. Percy and Vax, you notice the
people approaching, spattered in mud and various

218
00:22:45,026 --> 00:22:56,015
types of ichor or blood. As they get closer, you
can see beneath the helmets: tired human faces.

219
00:22:56,015 --> 00:23:01,804
Stepping up the side, weapons at the ready. As
they approach the very front of the line, you see

220
00:23:01,804 --> 00:23:09,055
Keeper Yennen, equally exhausted, stepping
forward, essentially ready to storm the castle.

221
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:20,605
You see behind them as they approach a scattered
cluster of broken corpses, some human, some a

222
00:23:20,605 --> 00:23:28,366
little less human. It looks like the rebellion
army seems to have cut its way through the

223
00:23:28,366 --> 00:23:33,646
remaining defenders of Castle Whitestone and are
making their way towards the front of the castle.

224
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:43,805
As they get closer, they meet your gaze, and the
front of the group draw their weapons, and Yennen

225
00:23:43,805 --> 00:23:51,401
steps forwards a little bit. "You there!
Percival."

226
00:23:51,401 --> 00:23:53,235
TALIESIN: I step forward.

227
00:23:53,235 --> 00:23:57,199
MATT: "Vox Machina. Are your wits about you?"

228
00:23:57,199 --> 00:23:59,396
TRAVIS: Yes?

229
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:00,466
MARISHA: Yes.

230
00:24:00,466 --> 00:24:02,366
TALIESIN: The Briarwoods are dead.

231
00:24:02,366 --> 00:24:04,024
MARISHA: It's true.

232
00:24:04,024 --> 00:24:08,407
LIAM: Serpent's head has been cut off, but there
is much to do.

233
00:24:08,407 --> 00:24:10,735
MARISHA: Is it still cloudy?

234
00:24:10,735 --> 00:24:15,246
MATT: It's a little cloudy. It's not rainstorm
ready, but there's still sort

235
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:17,196
of an overcast feel.

236
00:24:17,196 --> 00:24:24,849
MARISHA: I'm going to go ahead and at third level,
because that's all I got left, cast Skywrite

237
00:24:24,849 --> 00:24:28,907
again, and throw up the de Rolo crest once again
in the sky.

238
00:24:28,907 --> 00:24:36,134
MATT: Okay. As you begin to coalesce the clouds
and the symbol and the shapes, you see a bunch of

239
00:24:36,134 --> 00:24:39,909
the soldiers look around and Yennen steps forward
again towards you and goes, reaching up holding

240
00:24:39,909 --> 00:24:46,774
his holy symbol of Erathis to his chest, he goes,
"Are you certain this is done? Percival."

241
00:24:46,774 --> 00:24:57,658
TALIESIN: There's still a great evil beneath the
castle, but the Briarwoods are no more.

242
00:24:57,658 --> 00:25:09,406
MATT: He turns around, looks to his men who are
all looking at him expectantly. "Well, you heard

243
00:25:09,406 --> 00:25:19,036
"the man. The Briarwoods are dead. Whitestone is
free once more!" He looks up to the sky as the

244
00:25:19,036 --> 00:25:26,047
symbol finishes from Keyleth's spell. "The de
Rolos are in power once again!"

245
00:25:26,047 --> 00:25:35,499
At which point the entire crowd shouts "yeah!"
Their weapons to the sky, and as the shouts begin

246
00:25:35,499 --> 00:25:42,049
to echo down into the valley of Whitestone, you
can see little lights begin to burn in the distance,

247
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:48,607
little notification lanterns that are being lit
and set at windowtops, at the top of the mountain,

248
00:25:48,607 --> 00:25:53,846
and you can see this look of relief and joy on
every soldier's face as they all realize that the

249
00:25:53,846 --> 00:25:59,667
death they were all marching to face is no longer
a threat. Cassandra, at this point, is still

250
00:25:59,667 --> 00:26:05,938
standing behind you at your side, and really for
the first time since all of this went down

251
00:26:05,938 --> 00:26:08,479
beneath, you see a smile on her face.

252
00:26:08,479 --> 00:26:19,998
Yennen turns around again and approaches you all.
(sighs) "I don't know what to say. Well, come.

253
00:26:19,998 --> 00:26:26,499
"There's much to discuss. Let us step from this
foul place for the time being. Men! Walk through,

254
00:26:26,499 --> 00:26:29,128
"make sure it's clean." And the some of the
soldiers--

255
00:26:29,128 --> 00:26:30,118
MARISHA: No!

256
00:26:30,118 --> 00:26:35,499
TALIESIN: There's still a matter of some things
beneath the castle that we must deal with first.

257
00:26:35,548 --> 00:26:39,668
MARISHA: No one should be allowed in for right
now, until we figure this out.

258
00:26:39,668 --> 00:26:43,050
MATT: "Very well. Men, seal the doors, seal the
entrances. Keep watch."

259
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:46,248
MARISHA: We really need to rest.

260
00:26:46,248 --> 00:26:51,660
MATT: "Then come. You've certainly earned it." And
he motions to a few of the guards.

261
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:55,538
MARISHA: What time of day is it? Do we have a
sense? Is the sun still up?

262
00:26:55,538 --> 00:26:59,631
MATT: The sun's still up, but you can see from the
light source and the darkening of the sky and the

263
00:26:59,631 --> 00:27:05,679
color pushing from a general white-grey. It's
going a little more reddish-orange.

264
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:15,169
MARISHA: Before we take a rest, I'm going to look
at Percy, and I'm going to be like, I'll catch up

265
00:27:15,169 --> 00:27:21,189
with you guys. I think the people need to see the
sun. And I'm going to go into my air elemental

266
00:27:21,189 --> 00:27:29,960
form, go up into the sky above Whitestone, and do
my Whirlwind ability and start trying to just push

267
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,281
all of the clouds out of the way to let the sun
in.

268
00:27:34,281 --> 00:27:37,760
MATT: All right, as you guys begin--

269
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,251
LAURA: Oh, did she freeze?

270
00:27:39,251 --> 00:27:41,969
SAM: She's frozen in a beautifully surprised
expression.

271
00:27:41,969 --> 00:27:44,109
MATT: She can still hear us.

272
00:27:44,109 --> 00:27:46,560
LAURA: Oh, she can still hear us but she's
frozen.

273
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,839
SAM: Surprise!

274
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:55,460
MATT: You guys begin to march down towards the
city with the rest of the army. A group of about

275
00:27:55,460 --> 00:28:01,200
ten men stay behind just to guard the castle. As
you make you way to the northern side of

276
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:07,671
Whitestone and you enter the streets again, you
can see families beginning to walk out of their

277
00:28:07,671 --> 00:28:14,500
homes in the streets. In the entirety of your time
here in Whitestone, most folks that didn't need to

278
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:20,616
be out in the open stayed indoors, and you begin
to realize this seeming ghost city was hiding a

279
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:26,640
lot more life and a lot more hope than you had
expected, and you see families, and children,

280
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:34,837
stepping out, and as you walk through the streets
you can see the kids wave. You meet eyes with some

281
00:28:34,837 --> 00:28:37,200
of the possible widows, who mouth to you, "Thank
you".

282
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,659
LIAM: Seeing that--

283
00:28:41,729 --> 00:28:45,390
TALIESIN: Can we pass by the Alcove?

284
00:28:45,431 --> 00:28:52,109
LIAM: Seeing that, I'm going to do the buddy arm
around the shoulder and pull my sister in close.

285
00:28:52,138 --> 00:28:53,656
MATT: Okay.

286
00:28:53,656 --> 00:29:03,694
SAM: (clears throat) I walk up to a particularly
handsome widow, and I say, your husband--

287
00:29:03,694 --> 00:29:08,021
LAURA: Pike is right here.

288
00:29:08,021 --> 00:29:10,889
SAM: Oh. Your husband died for a good cause,
thanks, bye.

289
00:29:10,889 --> 00:29:14,659
(laughter)

290
00:29:14,659 --> 00:29:16,929
TALIESIN: Pike is shocked. Pike is shocked and
offended.

291
00:29:16,929 --> 00:29:22,349
SAM: Why are you looking at me like that, Pike?
Pike, stop it!

292
00:29:22,349 --> 00:29:31,301
MATT: As you walk away, she looks really confused
and clutches her chest in horror for a moment as

293
00:29:31,301 --> 00:29:35,510
one of the soldiers walking with you steps by her
side, looking at you curiously, and gives her a

294
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:37,941
kiss on the cheek. She goes, "Who was that man?"

295
00:29:37,941 --> 00:29:39,216
SAM: Oh, sorry.

296
00:29:39,216 --> 00:29:46,950
TALIESIN: Can we-- definitely want to go, let's stop
by the Alcove.

297
00:29:47,009 --> 00:29:49,280
MATT: Okay. You eventually start making your way
towards the Alcove as you

298
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,901
enter deeper into the city.

299
00:29:50,901 --> 00:29:53,130
LIAM: Pike, you there? Can you hear us?

300
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:55,300
MARISHA: Have I cleared up enough of the sky at
this point?

301
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,840
MATT: We're going to get to that right now,
actually.

302
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,080
MARISHA: I want to get to that.

303
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,360
MATT: As you guys are stepping-- I'm sorry, what?

304
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,571
SAM: No, it's okay.

305
00:30:02,571 --> 00:30:05,729
MATT: Pushing further in you can see now the
clouds beginning to dissipate, and also for the

306
00:30:05,819 --> 00:30:12,092
first time since you've been here you see blue sky
directly above the city. The vibrant

307
00:30:12,092 --> 00:30:18,984
orange-red-purple colors of the sunset now come
cascading along the city of Whitestone, and

308
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:24,911
there's a collective (gasps), an inhale and gasp
of awe from the soldiers and the people alike as

309
00:30:24,911 --> 00:30:31,182
this opens up above you. You begin to walk past.
The Alcove's to your left, if you wish to--

310
00:30:31,182 --> 00:30:32,832
TALIESIN: I want to stop in.

311
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:39,123
MATT: Okay. As you start heading towards the Alcove
you can see Jordana is already out on the front

312
00:30:39,166 --> 00:30:43,901
stoop looking up at the sky. She looks over and
sees you. "Percival!"

313
00:30:43,901 --> 00:30:45,301
TALIESIN: I give her a big hug.

314
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:50,782
MATT: It takes her by surprise at the moment, and
then she gives in and

315
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:52,309
continues to give the hug back.

316
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:56,634
TALIESIN: This would not have been possible
without your help. Thank you for everything.

317
00:30:56,634 --> 00:31:08,781
MATT: "Of course." She leans into the hug a little
bit, then nods and then raises her head. "Did you

318
00:31:08,781 --> 00:31:09,912
"see my father?"

319
00:31:09,912 --> 00:31:14,292
TALIESIN: I have not. We have not searched the
castle yet, though.

320
00:31:14,292 --> 00:31:17,895
LAURA: We just left it? We haven't searched the
castle?

321
00:31:17,895 --> 00:31:20,502
MARISHA: We searched a little bit.

322
00:31:20,502 --> 00:31:22,494
LAURA: But there could be live people in there
when we sealed it?

323
00:31:22,494 --> 00:31:25,793
TALIESIN: We don't know. It's not airtight or
anything. I mean, they're breathing.

324
00:31:25,793 --> 00:31:29,150
SAM: Ripley's gone and also there's a goliath on
the loose.

325
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:38,842
MATT: As you say this, Keeper Yennen goes, "Not
anymore, there isn't. Follow me."

326
00:31:38,842 --> 00:31:41,744
ALL: Ooh.

327
00:31:41,744 --> 00:31:44,053
SAM: Are there any young boys around?

328
00:31:44,053 --> 00:31:48,551
MATT: He stops in his tracks and looks over his
shoulder and goes, "What?"

329
00:31:48,551 --> 00:31:50,883
SAM: I just need a young, fleet-footed boy.

330
00:31:50,883 --> 00:31:54,145
TRAVIS: See, the last time I asked for a young boy
people gave me shit, too.

331
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:56,637
TALIESIN: No, we're going to give him shit.
There's no problem here.

332
00:31:56,637 --> 00:32:00,354
MATT: He slowly turns away and keeps walking
forward.

333
00:32:00,354 --> 00:32:04,115
SAM: Or a girl! No, wait, that sounds weird.

334
00:32:04,115 --> 00:32:11,214
TRAVIS: Yep. You can't say it in a right way. It's
impossible. Innocent request.

335
00:32:11,214 --> 00:32:15,714
MATT: The people have begun following behind your
procession towards the center of the city.

336
00:32:15,714 --> 00:32:18,352
LIAM: Bring me your smallest, most helpless
child.

337
00:32:18,352 --> 00:32:21,746
(laughter)

338
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:26,435
ASHLEY: Oh god.

339
00:32:26,435 --> 00:32:29,005
TRAVIS: That's fucked up.

340
00:32:29,005 --> 00:32:31,034
TALIESIN: That's going to explode.

341
00:32:31,034 --> 00:32:33,774
SAM: All right. Show us what you want to show us,
Yennen.

342
00:32:33,774 --> 00:32:40,384
MATT: You see behind you soldiers reuniting with
their families, friends gathering in the streets,

343
00:32:40,384 --> 00:32:44,324
and the people of Whitestone are now beginning to
join the sides of your procession towards the

344
00:32:44,324 --> 00:32:50,719
center of the Sun Square in the middle of
Whitestone. As you crest into the outskirts of the

345
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:56,365
square, Yennen gives a couple of whispered orders
to a couple of the soldiers, who rush off. You can

346
00:32:56,365 --> 00:32:58,475
see people are now gathering in the center and
there's actually people

347
00:32:58,475 --> 00:33:00,145
gathering around the Sun Tree.

348
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:08,195
As they all step to the Sun Tree, it's a little
quiet, and Keeper Yennen reaches up and pulls his

349
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:16,996
holy symbol of Erathis again, looks up to the tree
and looks back at the rest of you and goes, "For

350
00:33:16,996 --> 00:33:28,203
"generations, it was those of the Zenith who looked
over this tree and these people here, and it was

351
00:33:28,203 --> 00:33:40,345
"by the evil that once held foot in this town that
Father Reynal, the last of his line, was slain. We

352
00:33:40,345 --> 00:33:48,686
"will work to find those who wish to take up the
mantle to clean and rebuild the Zenith, the

353
00:33:48,686 --> 00:33:57,246
"pinnacle of Pelor's grace here in Whitestone. But
until that I, Yennen, swear to make this tree's

354
00:33:57,246 --> 00:34:09,247
"safety my responsibility. This symbol of hope,
this center of the crest of your family has held

355
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:13,916
"the slivers of light in our hearts for a very long
time.

356
00:34:13,945 --> 00:34:30,076
"Let us all take a moment and thank the heroes who
made this freedom possible: to the strong mountain

357
00:34:30,076 --> 00:34:52,607
"of joy and bravery, Grog. To the gentle, to the
kind, to the just soul, Pike. To the swift of bow,

358
00:34:52,607 --> 00:35:01,988
"keen of sight, and the most adorable creature to
accompany her--" as Trinket steps forward and

359
00:35:01,988 --> 00:35:21,227
nuzzles your side-- "Trinket. By the agility, by
the cunning, by the loyalty of Vax. By the

360
00:35:21,227 --> 00:35:45,549
"cleverness, by the wit, and the strange interests
of Scanlan. By the honesty, by the nature and

361
00:35:45,549 --> 00:36:08,139
"connection with the world, and the wonder of
Keyleth. And by the strength of blood, and the

362
00:36:08,139 --> 00:36:10,153
"willingness to sacrifice-- "

363
00:36:10,153 --> 00:36:12,589
ASHLEY: (mic bump)

364
00:36:12,589 --> 00:36:13,707
MATT: "Pardon me."

365
00:36:13,707 --> 00:36:33,019
(laughter)

366
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:36,250
MATT: Damn it.

367
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,484
SAM: Start that one again?

368
00:36:38,484 --> 00:36:39,853
LIAM: It's still very beautiful.

369
00:36:39,853 --> 00:36:41,322
MARISHA: So beautiful.

370
00:36:41,322 --> 00:36:48,720
TALIESIN: Two years on a sitcom. I can hold this
all day.

371
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:58,669
(laughter)

372
00:36:58,669 --> 00:36:59,690
MATT: God damn it.

373
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:02,921
LAURA: Percival's just waiting for his
introduction.

374
00:37:02,921 --> 00:37:05,686
LIAM: To the stone-cold motherfucker on air.

375
00:37:05,686 --> 00:37:18,220
MATT: "To the return of those valiants we once
thought lost, and those who rise up to restore the

376
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:30,481
"joy of these people. Percival. May we raise our
weapons, our glasses, and our children, who accept

377
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:40,582
"this future to rebuild. Raise to Vox Machina.
Hyah!" And everyone raises as one loud--

378
00:37:40,582 --> 00:37:45,689
TRAVIS: Yeah! Vox Machina!

379
00:37:45,689 --> 00:37:52,141
MATT: As the sun slowly sets, the light coming
through in beautiful colors now. You see what was

380
00:37:52,141 --> 00:38:00,021
once a very bleak town suddenly be renewed with a
spectrum of new accents. You begin to hear music

381
00:38:00,021 --> 00:38:04,316
being played, as now the celebration begins with
the sun's setting. Folks are turning this into a

382
00:38:04,316 --> 00:38:08,861
full celebration now. People are starting to bring
out food and--

383
00:38:08,861 --> 00:38:10,210
MARISHA: Block party!

384
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:16,085
MATT: (laughs) You feel this sense that this is
the first time in a long time the people have ever

385
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:25,682
really been allowed to be happy about something.
And the energy is infectious in itself. As the

386
00:38:25,682 --> 00:38:30,974
celebration begins, though, Yennen puts up his
hand and people begin to slow and calm as

387
00:38:31,038 --> 00:38:42,954
men begin to bring forward two individuals in
chains. One of which you see is a half-orc female

388
00:38:42,954 --> 00:38:49,192
in dark brown leather armor. She is chained and
thrown onto her knees onto the ground, and she

389
00:38:49,192 --> 00:38:53,822
spits; you can see there's a few cuts across her
face and she looks dirty. And right next to her,

390
00:38:53,822 --> 00:39:02,909
taking four men to do so, a goliath who's bruised
is also thrown onto his knees and they're both

391
00:39:02,909 --> 00:39:05,201
just held at that place.

392
00:39:05,201 --> 00:39:14,226
Yennen says, "The two remaining new nobles, given
power here as they aided the Briarwoods in taking

393
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:25,693
"this city. We have Duke--" which the people spit
at the sound of the name-- "Goran Vedmeyer. And

394
00:39:25,745 --> 00:39:34,302
"Countess Jazna Graben. You have been found guilty
of treason against this town, of the

395
00:39:34,302 --> 00:39:42,359
"responsibility of many lives lost, innocent. And
for furthering the plans of the evil that has

396
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:53,140
"oppressed us so long. I would wish that you, the
ones who freed us, deliver the judgment."

397
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,184
TRAVIS: (laughs)

398
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:56,512
LAURA: Come on.

399
00:39:56,512 --> 00:40:04,342
TRAVIS: No, that sounds fair. I've known to
preside over many legal matters in my time as

400
00:40:04,342 --> 00:40:07,823
Judgeface of Northwind.

401
00:40:07,823 --> 00:40:09,619
LIAM: Define "legal."

402
00:40:09,689 --> 00:40:11,171
MARISHA: Define "Judgeface."

403
00:40:11,171 --> 00:40:13,910
TRAVIS: It would just baffle all of you. It's all
right.

404
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:19,212
SAM: Grog, if I may. I can assist you in this, if
you'd like.

405
00:40:19,212 --> 00:40:23,701
TRAVIS: Oh, why of course, Sub-judge Scanlan.

406
00:40:23,701 --> 00:40:30,032
SAM: Thank you, Grog. Percival, this is your
kingdom, so if you--

407
00:40:30,032 --> 00:40:31,242
TALIESIN: I leave it to you.

408
00:40:31,242 --> 00:40:32,142
LAURA: No.

409
00:40:32,142 --> 00:40:33,829
TRAVIS: Yes. Even better.

410
00:40:33,829 --> 00:40:43,632
SAM: These two have done much violence to this
place. They represent all that is evil.

411
00:40:43,632 --> 00:40:51,291
MATT: "Wait." And Goran, who is now down on the
ground, looks up at you and goes, "I know you."

412
00:40:51,291 --> 00:40:53,832
SAM: Never saw you before, friend.

413
00:40:53,832 --> 00:40:56,483
TALIESIN: This is what I really wanted to see.

414
00:40:56,483 --> 00:41:00,035
SAM: You have a lovely house, by the way. Or had
one.

415
00:41:00,035 --> 00:41:03,002
(laughter)

416
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:05,113
MATT: Spits on the ground at your feet.

417
00:41:05,113 --> 00:41:18,632
SAM: Might need a new roofer. Anyway. In a show of
grace and to demonstrate our new hope that we have

418
00:41:18,703 --> 00:41:22,342
for this place, I suggest that we don't kill these
two.

419
00:41:22,342 --> 00:41:23,203
TRAVIS: What?

420
00:41:23,203 --> 00:41:27,853
SAM: But rather force them to help rebuild the
place that they helped destroy.

421
00:41:27,853 --> 00:41:32,631
LAURA: In chains. Very heavy chains.

422
00:41:32,631 --> 00:41:39,373
SAM: One of them at least is extremely strong. The
other one must have some sort of skill.

423
00:41:39,373 --> 00:41:45,772
MATT: She for the first time looks up with this
gnarly toothy grin. You can see these partially

424
00:41:45,772 --> 00:41:53,053
broken and jagged teeth in her mouth, and she
goes, "Come closer. I've never tasted gnome."

425
00:41:53,053 --> 00:41:54,900
SAM: Okay, so maybe we'll kill her.

426
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,541
LAURA: Would you rather die?

427
00:41:56,541 --> 00:41:59,423
TRAVIS: What kind of weapons did these two have on
them?

428
00:41:59,423 --> 00:42:07,910
MATT: The men look about themselves and Yennen,
"Not entirely certain. However, she has been known

429
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:13,243
"to carry a quiver or two, and this one here wields
a blade as long as his body."

430
00:42:13,243 --> 00:42:21,793
LIAM: The Briarwoods are broken and gone. You can
die today, or you can take your licks and help

431
00:42:21,793 --> 00:42:29,242
rebuild this city. No one is here to protect you
or save you. You can work hard, start again.

432
00:42:29,242 --> 00:42:35,565
MATT: Make a persuasion check. With advantage,
based on their current circumstance.

433
00:42:35,565 --> 00:42:40,804
LIAM: Intimidation, you said, or persuasion?

434
00:42:40,804 --> 00:42:42,678
MATT: Whichever you'd prefer.

435
00:42:42,678 --> 00:42:45,262
LIAM: It's average, it's 13.

436
00:42:45,262 --> 00:43:01,335
MATT: 13? Okay. You can see the goliath, Vedmeyer,
lowers his head. "I accept. Jazna?"

437
00:43:01,335 --> 00:43:15,796
She looks over. "It seems you lack what has kept
me alive all these years: a spine. Kill me. I'd

438
00:43:15,796 --> 00:43:18,435
"rather not stay at your beck and call."

439
00:43:18,435 --> 00:43:19,277
TRAVIS: Okay.

440
00:43:19,277 --> 00:43:20,204
TALIESIN: Grog.

441
00:43:20,204 --> 00:43:23,177
TRAVIS: I reach over and I take out my greataxe
and I aim it for her neck.

442
00:43:23,177 --> 00:43:26,312
MATT: Okay, as, did you swing or just aim it?

443
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:29,188
TRAVIS: Yeah, swing for the neck.
Beheading-style.

444
00:43:29,188 --> 00:43:36,155
MATT: Make a strength check.

445
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:37,459
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

446
00:43:37,459 --> 00:43:41,175
(laughter)

447
00:43:41,175 --> 00:43:44,326
LIAM: Merry Christmas, Travis.

448
00:43:44,326 --> 00:43:50,074
MATT: As you pull the axe out and you walk
alongside with it almost like a cane,

449
00:43:50,074 --> 00:43:51,825
look down at her--

450
00:43:51,825 --> 00:43:53,376
TRAVIS: Yeah, like a cane.

451
00:43:53,376 --> 00:43:59,046
MATT: (impact noise) And with speed and deftness
where no one sees the blade make contact, there is

452
00:43:59,046 --> 00:44:06,875
a moment where the head just drifts off the form,
leaving the base, the throat cleanly cleaven.

453
00:44:06,875 --> 00:44:15,605
Cloven, if you will, sorry. There's a moment of
pause before the blood begins to pour from the

454
00:44:15,605 --> 00:44:21,524
wound, it was so fast and so immediate, and the
body just slumps forward. There's a gasp in the

455
00:44:21,524 --> 00:44:27,837
crowd suddenly, and then a cheer as the locals now
see one of the people that probably oppressed,

456
00:44:27,837 --> 00:44:32,317
tortured, and killed many of their folk now lies
on the ground, killed.

457
00:44:32,317 --> 00:44:40,526
TRAVIS: I look at the axe and look at the blood
covering it and I look over at Duke Gonad and I

458
00:44:40,526 --> 00:44:46,550
say, so, where are you from and how did you come
to be in the service of the Briarwoods?

459
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:50,445
MATT: "I was hired in Wildmount."

460
00:44:50,445 --> 00:44:53,871
TRAVIS: Do I know where that is?

461
00:44:53,871 --> 00:44:59,673
MATT: You don't. You've heard it said before.
You've heard it mentioned, but you have no idea

462
00:44:59,673 --> 00:45:00,767
where it is.

463
00:45:00,767 --> 00:45:03,987
TRAVIS: Right, the holy lands of the sacred-- all
right.

464
00:45:03,987 --> 00:45:05,954
SAM: Are you okay, your honor?

465
00:45:05,954 --> 00:45:11,477
TRAVIS: Yes, thank you for-- I am quite tired.
Would you like to take it from here?

466
00:45:11,477 --> 00:45:12,608
SAM: No.

467
00:45:12,608 --> 00:45:19,559
TALIESIN: While we always must dispense our
justice, this is now a town of mercy as well. And

468
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:29,021
I will expect nothing less from all of us than to
give what we have lacked for so long. Duke.

469
00:45:29,021 --> 00:45:31,398
SAM: Let hers be the last blood shed.

470
00:45:31,398 --> 00:45:35,785
TALIESIN: Earn your life again.

471
00:45:35,785 --> 00:45:45,379
MATT: He nods and looks down. You can't tell if
it's shame or just defeat, but his shoulders slump

472
00:45:45,379 --> 00:45:52,818
and that little bit of fire that was in him when
he arrived is broken. The men look at you, they

473
00:45:52,818 --> 00:45:56,518
get your nod and they lift the chains and pull
them off while a couple of the men pick up the

474
00:45:56,518 --> 00:46:01,373
body of the half-orc woman and pull them out of
the crowd. The music swells up once again, and the

475
00:46:01,373 --> 00:46:06,051
celebration continues without a beat. You can now
see tables being brought out to the center and

476
00:46:06,051 --> 00:46:11,818
glasses are set about and drinks are being poured
as a giant central table right at the base of the

477
00:46:11,818 --> 00:46:14,169
Sun Tree is set for you.

478
00:46:14,169 --> 00:46:20,300
TALIESIN: They've just had this shit in a
Tupperware container, like in those big bins in

479
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:23,938
the back for the last five years with like
duct-tape lids.

480
00:46:23,938 --> 00:46:28,769
MATT: It's not a grand meal, there hasn't been a
lot of time to prepare for it, but basically what

481
00:46:28,769 --> 00:46:33,855
it looks like is whoever is preparing dinner or
whatever food was readily available, they're just

482
00:46:33,855 --> 00:46:36,769
bringing it out. It's more of like a
share-with-whoever's-there type effort.

483
00:46:36,769 --> 00:46:37,868
MARISHA: Aw, it's a potluck.

484
00:46:37,868 --> 00:46:39,000
MATT: Kind of.

485
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:45,019
SAM: I find a young boy.

486
00:46:45,053 --> 00:46:46,529
MATT: Yes, Scanlan?

487
00:46:46,529 --> 00:46:52,269
SAM: Or a soldier, and I give him 15 gold and I
say,

488
00:46:52,269 --> 00:46:58,294
for the love of god, find me a fucking beret.

489
00:46:58,294 --> 00:47:05,489
MATT: "All right, sir." And the boy takes the gold
and rushes off, looking in his hands at the boon

490
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:12,380
he's been given by this practically-same-height
man. They don't see gnomes here very often; it's

491
00:47:12,434 --> 00:47:14,180
been very confusing.

492
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:20,881
TALIESIN: I want to take some time to tell Keeper
Yennen about what is beneath the tree and let him

493
00:47:20,881 --> 00:47:23,481
start to macerate some theories on what to do--

494
00:47:23,481 --> 00:47:27,074
TRAVIS: Macerate? That's a big word.

495
00:47:27,074 --> 00:47:29,549
MATT: After you finish this conversation, he sits
there and--

496
00:47:29,549 --> 00:47:32,417
TALIESIN: It's a word for big name. Thank you. Do
it.

497
00:47:32,417 --> 00:47:43,160
MATT: A few moments pass before the boy returns,
in his hand a (singing) raspberry beret, the kind

498
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,200
you find in a secondhand store.

499
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,671
SAM: Oh, feels good.

500
00:47:46,671 --> 00:47:49,190
LAURA: Make it look cooler on him, because he made
it look dorky.

501
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:53,051
TALIESIN: It's a beret. I don't think he made it
dorky. I think it comes with

502
00:47:53,051 --> 00:47:55,360
that already sewn in.

503
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:58,711
LAURA: There it is, looks good. It looks good,
Scanlan.

504
00:47:58,711 --> 00:48:04,301
SAM: Thank you, young boy. Whatever your name was.
What was your name, young boy?

505
00:48:04,301 --> 00:48:07,671
MARISHA: Make it good.

506
00:48:07,671 --> 00:48:09,471
MATT: "Randall?"

507
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:13,778
SAM: Thank you, Randall. You've made me a very
happy small man.

508
00:48:13,778 --> 00:48:15,521
MATT: And he brings you the change.

509
00:48:15,521 --> 00:48:21,802
SAM: Oh no, keep the change, it's all right. Go
buy yourself a goose. The biggest goose in town.

510
00:48:21,802 --> 00:48:25,233
(laughter)

511
00:48:25,233 --> 00:48:26,793
TALIESIN: With a beret.

512
00:48:26,793 --> 00:48:32,664
MATT: And he darts off excitedly. You catch him
out of the corner of your eye like stealing a swig

513
00:48:32,664 --> 00:48:33,590
of beer--

514
00:48:33,590 --> 00:48:35,590
SAM: Brandon Gilmore, that was his young name.

515
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:36,812
LAURA: Brandon Gilmore?

516
00:48:36,812 --> 00:48:37,921
SAM: Yes.

517
00:48:37,921 --> 00:48:47,153
MATT: Thank you, Brandon. So after you finish
regaling this tale to Keeper Yennen, let's see if

518
00:48:47,153 --> 00:48:50,043
I have a proper song for celebration.

519
00:48:50,043 --> 00:48:54,768
TRAVIS: I'm doing my best to empty the cask of ale
into the town patrons and myself.

520
00:48:54,768 --> 00:48:58,811
TALIESIN: I don't know if that's-- less aviary than
celebratory.

521
00:48:58,811 --> 00:49:00,252
MATT: Yeah, unfortunately.

522
00:49:00,322 --> 00:49:06,382
MARISHA: Can Keyleth go over and check out the Sun
Tree?

523
00:49:06,382 --> 00:49:11,814
MATT: Sure, as you're walking over there, we'll
finish this conversation here. Yennen nods to

524
00:49:11,863 --> 00:49:22,602
himself and goes, "That is disconcerting. I'll
reach out to a few of my contacts, see who we can

525
00:49:22,602 --> 00:49:30,446
"bring here to inspect it. I may go down tomorrow
myself and have a look. Is it safe?"

526
00:49:30,446 --> 00:49:38,761
TALIESIN: No. There are traps. We've marked them.
It's also disturbing.

527
00:49:38,761 --> 00:49:48,414
MATT: "All right. I'll bring a trusted team down,
then. If there's anyone you know who has vast

528
00:49:48,414 --> 00:49:53,584
"historical or arcane knowledge, I would recommend
possibly having them come take a look as well.

529
00:49:53,584 --> 00:49:55,815
"Unfortunately, I'm rather limited in my
teachings."

530
00:49:55,815 --> 00:49:56,852
SAM: Pike?

531
00:49:56,852 --> 00:49:58,361
LAURA: Allura?

532
00:49:58,361 --> 00:49:59,913
SAM: But she's not in town.

533
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:01,723
TALIESIN: We can send word.

534
00:50:01,723 --> 00:50:03,243
MATT: "Please do."

535
00:50:03,243 --> 00:50:05,393
LAURA: What about Ryndarien?

536
00:50:05,393 --> 00:50:06,872
MARISHA: Eskil?

537
00:50:06,872 --> 00:50:09,504
MATT: There was Eskil Ryndarien, the archmage in
Westruun.

538
00:50:09,504 --> 00:50:13,143
LIAM: Yes. Either, both.

539
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:20,260
MATT: "Good, good, yes, anyone at all. Maybe I'll
be able to glean something, but unfortunately most

540
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:32,175
"of our books were confiscated when the town was
taken. However, I appreciate that, and at least

541
00:50:32,245 --> 00:50:38,444
"for the time being, there doesn't seem to be any
dead rising from the grave."

542
00:50:38,492 --> 00:50:41,553
SAM: If I may, Percy, may I make a suggestion?

543
00:50:41,553 --> 00:50:43,894
TALIESIN: Is it going to be throwing the rest of
my guns into a pit of acid?

544
00:50:43,894 --> 00:50:46,534
SAM: No, but it will be spending some of your
kingdom's money.

545
00:50:46,534 --> 00:50:48,943
TALIESIN: Replacing the guns that you threw into a
pit of acid.

546
00:50:48,943 --> 00:50:50,421
SAM: Let's not talk about the guns.

547
00:50:50,421 --> 00:50:53,424
TALIESIN: I really can't think of what else I'd
want to talk about. Please, go ahead.

548
00:50:53,465 --> 00:50:57,543
SAM: If most of their books have been taken from
them, perhaps we could use some of the treasury to

549
00:50:57,543 --> 00:50:59,656
build a library.

550
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:02,685
TALIESIN: That is not a terrible idea, and it's
possible that the books are still within the

551
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:03,585
castle.

552
00:51:03,585 --> 00:51:05,903
LAURA: It's possible that the Briarwoods have
hoarded all of them. In fact, we might find

553
00:51:05,903 --> 00:51:09,503
something about this entity inside the castle.

554
00:51:09,503 --> 00:51:15,984
TALIESIN: And we do need to build three new
structures where the lords' houses were, and I

555
00:51:15,984 --> 00:51:19,554
find the idea of rebuilding those mansions to be a
bit distasteful.

556
00:51:19,554 --> 00:51:26,918
SAM: Perhaps we could even name one of the
libraries Gilmore's Glorious Books.

557
00:51:26,981 --> 00:51:31,033
TRAVIS: Set up a satellite chain?

558
00:51:31,033 --> 00:51:41,025
TALIESIN: We will discuss it. It's got a ring, I
will admit.

559
00:51:41,025 --> 00:51:42,995
MATT: While you guys are having this
conversation--

560
00:51:42,995 --> 00:51:45,743
LIAM: Oh, I was just going to add to that, I'm
sure the man can help

561
00:51:45,743 --> 00:51:48,624
in this city's time of need.

562
00:51:48,624 --> 00:51:51,744
TALIESIN: You were doing something, as well.

563
00:51:51,744 --> 00:51:54,003
MATT: Yes. Keyleth, at this point, as you've
walked away from this conversation, you approach

564
00:51:54,003 --> 00:52:02,126
the Sun Tree. It stands there with a little bit of
light as the sun's just now passing over the

565
00:52:02,126 --> 00:52:08,803
distant mountain range that surrounds this valley.
The sky's growing more purple and dark blue. But

566
00:52:08,803 --> 00:52:12,805
now lights have been lit and lanterns have been
brought to the center, you can see the Sun Tree in

567
00:52:12,805 --> 00:52:14,340
full before you.

568
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:21,465
MARISHA: I reach up and I put my hand on it and I
cast Commune With Nature. Do I gather anything?

569
00:52:21,465 --> 00:52:24,045
MATT: What does Commune With Nature do in full?

570
00:52:24,045 --> 00:52:25,817
TALIESIN: It lets you commune with nature.

571
00:52:25,817 --> 00:52:26,723
MARISHA: Essentially.

572
00:52:26,723 --> 00:52:29,697
MATT: Oh, look at that, first page I open up to.
Okay.

573
00:52:29,697 --> 00:52:31,465
TALIESIN: It's like a DM version of natural 20.

574
00:52:31,465 --> 00:52:34,484
LAURA: It is. Except he does it all the time.

575
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:37,265
MATT: Okay, so which do you want to know, of all
the things that you can choose from?

576
00:52:37,265 --> 00:52:39,477
MARISHA: Oh, what are my choices?

577
00:52:39,477 --> 00:52:42,637
MATT: You can choose from terrain or bodies of
water in the vicinity; prevalent plants, minerals,

578
00:52:42,637 --> 00:52:46,896
animals, or peoples; powerful celestials, fey,
fiends, or elementals or undead within 300 feet of

579
00:52:46,896 --> 00:52:51,552
it-- or sorry, within three miles of it; influence
from other planes of existence; or buildings.

580
00:52:51,552 --> 00:52:57,079
MARISHA: The influence of other planes of
existence sounds promising.

581
00:52:57,079 --> 00:53:02,332
MATT: Okay, you gain three facts. So, first off,
you notice as you touch the Sun Tree and you cast

582
00:53:02,384 --> 00:53:10,085
the spell, whereas previously you felt just dead
wood and a lack of any presence, there is a small

583
00:53:10,085 --> 00:53:12,586
seed of life in the tree once again.

584
00:53:12,586 --> 00:53:14,956
MARISHA: That's good.

585
00:53:14,956 --> 00:53:22,426
MATT: We'll call that the first one, as a given.
As you inquire about any other planes of

586
00:53:22,426 --> 00:53:40,627
existence, you do sense that at least some element
nearby relates to a realm of shadow.

587
00:53:40,627 --> 00:53:43,356
LAURA: That's obvious.

588
00:53:43,356 --> 00:53:45,418
MARISHA: Yeah, sure, okay.

589
00:53:45,418 --> 00:53:47,356
MATT: And what's the third one you want to know?

590
00:53:47,356 --> 00:53:49,837
MARISHA: Oh, I get a choice?

591
00:53:49,837 --> 00:53:50,961
MATT: Yep.

592
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:58,337
MARISHA: I didn't know I had a choice.

593
00:53:58,337 --> 00:54:01,882
MATT: You don't have to ask anything else if you
don't want to, if you got everything you wanted.

594
00:54:01,882 --> 00:54:15,546
MARISHA: I want to know if-- god, so many options.
Is it going to be a good growing season this

595
00:54:15,546 --> 00:54:20,747
spring? Crops going to be good? It's going to be a
good harvest moon?

596
00:54:20,747 --> 00:54:22,918
LAURA: Ask how it's feeling, can you ask how it's
feeling?

597
00:54:22,918 --> 00:54:26,728
MARISHA: How's it feeling? Can I ask the tree how
it's feeling, can I be like, "Hey tree. How are

598
00:54:26,728 --> 00:54:27,978
"you doing today?"

599
00:54:27,978 --> 00:54:29,418
MATT: That is very Keyleth.

600
00:54:29,418 --> 00:54:32,654
MARISHA: You doing all right? How do you feel
between all this, about all this?

601
00:54:32,654 --> 00:54:33,569
MATT: You sense--

602
00:54:33,569 --> 00:54:34,512
SAM: Hey, boo.

603
00:54:34,512 --> 00:54:35,738
MARISHA: Hey, boo.

604
00:54:35,738 --> 00:54:45,674
MATT: You sense weariness, like something very old
that has been asleep for a very long time has

605
00:54:45,674 --> 00:54:47,207
woken up.

606
00:54:47,207 --> 00:54:49,051
MARISHA: Does it feel positive?

607
00:54:49,051 --> 00:54:50,528
MATT: Positive.

608
00:54:50,528 --> 00:54:51,554
MARISHA: Okay.

609
00:54:51,554 --> 00:55:03,608
MATT: The Sun Tree, seemingly kept at bay, locked
away, what bit of its life force it managed to

610
00:55:03,608 --> 00:55:10,234
maintain had been contained for so long and is now
finally free.

611
00:55:10,234 --> 00:55:15,519
MARISHA: Can I just say, good morning, old
friend.

612
00:55:15,519 --> 00:55:21,148
MATT: You sense the tree saying, "The sun just
set. It's not morning."

613
00:55:21,148 --> 00:55:27,309
MARISHA: I go, oh shit. And then I turn to Percy
and I say, the tree talked to me.

614
00:55:27,309 --> 00:55:30,950
TALIESIN: In that ancient way that trees talk.

615
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:35,988
MARISHA: You just had a smoke monster you were
talking to, is it that hard to believe?

616
00:55:35,988 --> 00:55:38,644
MATT: (Ent voice) It's... not... morning...

617
00:55:38,644 --> 00:55:40,039
TALIESIN: Thank you.

618
00:55:40,039 --> 00:55:45,910
LIAM: I watched her walk up to the tree and I
followed her--

619
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:47,119
TRAVIS and SAM: Oh no.

620
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:48,202
LAURA: Here we go.

621
00:55:48,202 --> 00:55:52,839
LIAM: Here we go. I follow her up and I don't say
anything, but I see one hand on the tree and

622
00:55:52,839 --> 00:55:54,171
without saying anything--

623
00:55:54,171 --> 00:55:56,828
TRAVIS: I walk up behind Vax and I pants him.

624
00:55:56,828 --> 00:55:58,169
LAURA: Yes!

625
00:55:58,169 --> 00:56:00,359
TRAVIS: And I grab the back of his collar and pull
backwards.

626
00:56:00,359 --> 00:56:01,847
SAM: That's the revenge.

627
00:56:01,847 --> 00:56:05,116
LIAM: Are you going to roll anything?

628
00:56:05,116 --> 00:56:06,891
MATT: Okay. So.

629
00:56:06,891 --> 00:56:09,738
LIAM: I'm not sure what he did though. Pantsing?

630
00:56:09,738 --> 00:56:11,940
TRAVIS: I grabbed your pants and I pulled them
down to your ankles.

631
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:13,519
LIAM: But what's the part about the collar?

632
00:56:13,519 --> 00:56:17,820
TRAVIS: I grabbed the back of your neck and pulled
you backwards with your pants around your ankles.

633
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:20,060
LIAM: Okay. He's got to roll, but if it happens,
it happens.

634
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:27,129
MATT: Right. I would consider this a grapple
check. So it's your athletics versus your

635
00:56:27,129 --> 00:56:28,829
acrobatics.

636
00:56:28,829 --> 00:56:31,400
LAURA: What about the pantsing? Is that included?

637
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,591
MATT: That is the pantsing.

638
00:56:32,591 --> 00:56:34,853
TRAVIS: 20, plus--

639
00:56:34,853 --> 00:56:36,683
MATT: Wait, natural 20?

640
00:56:36,683 --> 00:56:41,268
TRAVIS: No, 19 plus-- 26. My athletics is plus
seven.

641
00:56:41,268 --> 00:56:43,130
LIAM: I rolled a 32.

642
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:45,815
TRAVIS: Damn it.

643
00:56:45,815 --> 00:56:53,661
MATT: As you reach out and are about to grasp the
sides, he leaps straight up in the air and then

644
00:56:53,661 --> 00:56:59,131
lands a foot in front of you. You grab nothing and
see him glance over his shoulder and tsk-tsk.

645
00:56:59,131 --> 00:57:00,880
LIAM: I knew that was going to happen.

646
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:05,130
TRAVIS: That's all right. It could've been now.
It'll just be worse later.

647
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:07,641
SAM: Nice try, Grog.

648
00:57:07,641 --> 00:57:09,718
LIAM: You already took my left nut off my body.

649
00:57:09,718 --> 00:57:15,311
TRAVIS: Oh, please. That was but appetizers for the
main course, my friend.

650
00:57:15,361 --> 00:57:20,620
LIAM: All right, so that's challenge number one,
now challenge number two. So, I still don't say

651
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:26,763
anything besides (inhale) as I jump to the side
really fast to not loose my breeches. And she's

652
00:57:26,763 --> 00:57:32,233
got one hand on the tree, and I just quietly, with
her free hand and my free hand, try to lace my

653
00:57:32,233 --> 00:57:33,727
fingers with hers.

654
00:57:33,727 --> 00:57:34,692
MATT: Against the tree?

655
00:57:34,692 --> 00:57:37,554
LAURA: Oh my gosh, you guys are boyfriend and
girlfriend now.

656
00:57:37,554 --> 00:57:43,232
MATT: As you finish your awkward it's-not-morning
conversation with the essence of the Sun Tree--

657
00:57:43,232 --> 00:57:45,241
TALIESIN: It's morning somewhere.

658
00:57:45,241 --> 00:57:47,482
MARISHA: As I'm talking, good morning, Sun
Tree.

659
00:57:47,482 --> 00:57:55,787
MATT: You feel a strange alien hand in your left
free hand for a moment, unexpectedly.

660
00:57:55,787 --> 00:57:57,604
MARISHA: I jump and I yank away instinctually.

661
00:57:57,604 --> 00:58:01,691
MATT: Okay, she pulls away from it and looks over
her shoulder with a bit of surprise and sudden

662
00:58:01,691 --> 00:58:02,886
horror.

663
00:58:02,886 --> 00:58:06,281
LIAM: I shrug and look.

664
00:58:06,281 --> 00:58:17,062
MARISHA: I was just talking to the tree. It talked
back.

665
00:58:17,062 --> 00:58:23,683
LIAM: I don't say anything.

666
00:58:23,683 --> 00:58:31,622
(long pause)

667
00:58:31,622 --> 00:58:33,864
MARISHA: (giggling) Everyone is hiding.

668
00:58:33,864 --> 00:58:36,642
SAM: I'm giving them privacy.

669
00:58:36,642 --> 00:58:38,203
LAURA: You get privacy. It's your moment.

670
00:58:38,203 --> 00:58:42,146
MATT: So? Vax just stands there, not saying
anything, just looking at you.

671
00:58:42,146 --> 00:58:47,394
LIAM: I already said it.

672
00:58:47,394 --> 00:58:56,719
MATT: Don't look at them.

673
00:58:56,719 --> 00:59:15,633
MARISHA: I'm sorry. I don't know. I'm really
confused.

674
00:59:15,633 --> 00:59:27,883
LIAM: Vax says, all right. And walks off.

675
00:59:27,929 --> 00:59:50,914
MARISHA: Wait. I'd be lying if I said often at
night when I go to sleep, your face isn't the last

676
00:59:50,914 --> 01:00:10,786
thing that crosses my mind. But with the weight of
the world and the weight of the

677
01:00:10,786 --> 01:00:27,533
contact-embarrassment from our fellow party,
currently, it's hard to focus on. (hesitantly) You

678
01:00:27,581 --> 01:00:44,271
said that when you were near death. We say a lot
of things when we're near death. How do I know

679
01:00:44,271 --> 01:00:48,120
that's what you were truly feeling?

680
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:50,823
LIAM: I didn't say it out loud, I just thought
it.

681
01:00:50,823 --> 01:00:55,401
MATT: No, you told her.

682
01:00:55,401 --> 01:01:01,410
MARISHA: Oh yeah, no, you said that out loud.
Yeah, no, that wasn't in your head.

683
01:01:01,410 --> 01:01:21,763
LIAM: I wore a mask for a long time, where I grew
up. And I'm not going to do that anymore. I'll wait.

684
01:01:21,808 --> 01:01:25,972
MARISHA: Wait?

685
01:01:25,972 --> 01:01:34,471
LIAM: For you.

686
01:01:34,471 --> 01:02:08,574
MARISHA: Okay. I don't know what else to say right
now. I'm really tired. Really tired. I think

687
01:02:08,574 --> 01:02:14,373
there's also a part of me that's just afraid.

688
01:02:14,373 --> 01:02:29,864
LIAM: I feel like I'm going to get pantsed by a
goliath at any moment. Don't do anything. Don't

689
01:02:29,864 --> 01:02:41,687
change anything. I haven't lied. I've told the
truth. If you'll have me, I'm yours. If you don't

690
01:02:41,687 --> 01:02:52,596
want me, I understand. And that's all there is to
say. And then I actually walk off.

691
01:02:52,596 --> 01:02:53,908
MATT: Okay.

692
01:02:53,908 --> 01:02:56,455
MARISHA: I stay by the tree.

693
01:02:56,455 --> 01:03:04,019
MATT: Okay. As this is happening and he walks off,
you guys are there at the table, just now noticing

694
01:03:04,019 --> 01:03:11,255
the both of them have been missing. You see
Keyleth, stunned, standing by the Sun Tree as

695
01:03:11,255 --> 01:03:18,425
Keeper Yennen approaches you once again and goes,
"My friends. We have a lot of work to do and it

696
01:03:18,425 --> 01:03:28,644
"would not be fair for me to assume, as you've
already done so much for us, but it has been a

697
01:03:28,644 --> 01:03:34,814
"while since we've had much to celebrate in this
town, and this evening seems a fine

698
01:03:34,814 --> 01:03:49,946
"improvisational event. But we have two weeks until
the Winter's Crest festival would be happening

699
01:03:49,946 --> 01:03:58,866
"here in Whitestone, something we have not
celebrated in near five years. I would just ask,

700
01:03:58,866 --> 01:04:03,234
"should you be interested, if you would wish to
stay with us these next couple of weeks to help us

701
01:04:03,234 --> 01:04:14,395
"rebuild and perhaps aid in preparing the first
real shining moment in Whitestone's history since

702
01:04:14,395 --> 01:04:16,396
"you were gone."

703
01:04:16,396 --> 01:04:17,586
LAURA: Percival?

704
01:04:17,586 --> 01:04:19,069
TALIESIN: I would be very grateful.

705
01:04:19,069 --> 01:04:20,356
LAURA: We're here.

706
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:21,887
TALIESIN: We shall.

707
01:04:21,887 --> 01:04:23,566
MATT: Cassandra nods, as well.

708
01:04:23,566 --> 01:04:36,416
LAURA: Keeper, may I ask for a small request?
Could you maybe send a wonderfully worded letter

709
01:04:36,487 --> 01:04:44,387
to Uriel and let him know how we saved the day and
how much you love us?

710
01:04:44,387 --> 01:04:55,976
MATT: He looks very confused. "I imagine that
could be-- I assume that could be done, yes."

711
01:04:55,976 --> 01:05:00,658
LAURA: That would be wonderful. Make sure you
mention how terrible the Briarwoods were and how

712
01:05:00,658 --> 01:05:05,527
Vox Machina saved the day. Truly saved it--

713
01:05:05,527 --> 01:05:08,738
SAM: We can write it for you if you just want to
sign it at the bottom.

714
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:13,536
LIAM: That guy's going to wake up this morning and
go, "oh, I'm an asshole."

715
01:05:13,536 --> 01:05:16,566
LAURA: Please? Yes, that would be wonderful.

716
01:05:16,566 --> 01:05:18,547
MATT: "All right. It'll be done."

717
01:05:18,547 --> 01:05:19,624
LAURA: Thank you.

718
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:20,718
TRAVIS: Facepalm.

719
01:05:20,718 --> 01:05:23,897
LIAM: "Aw, what was I thinking. Oh."

720
01:05:23,897 --> 01:05:28,676
MATT: And so as the rest of you join in the
merriment, or whatever else you wish to do for the

721
01:05:28,676 --> 01:05:35,156
evening, looking about post-sunset as night
descends on Whitestone, to the first clear sky

722
01:05:35,156 --> 01:05:44,227
since you've arrived. To the first evening where
you can hear smiles, cheers, and laughter, we'll

723
01:05:44,227 --> 01:05:47,089
pick up next week with the Winter's Crest festival
in Whitestone.

724
01:05:47,089 --> 01:05:50,593
(cheering)

725
01:05:50,593 --> 01:05:53,769
LAURA: You should've kissed her, it was the
perfect moment!

726
01:05:53,769 --> 01:05:54,947
LIAM: I already did it.

727
01:05:54,947 --> 01:05:56,308
LAURA: No but it was the perfect moment!

728
01:05:56,308 --> 01:05:57,620
LIAM: You don't want it to happen anyway.

729
01:05:57,620 --> 01:06:00,687
LAURA: I don't care, this is out of character! It
would have been the perfect moment!

730
01:06:00,687 --> 01:06:02,046
LIAM: I never said I was smart.

731
01:06:02,046 --> 01:06:04,868
MATT: It makes for fun drama. That was crazy.

732
01:06:04,868 --> 01:06:06,919
TRAVIS: How am I going to beat your acrobatics?

733
01:06:06,919 --> 01:06:08,042
LIAM: You are not.

734
01:06:08,042 --> 01:06:17,385
ZAC: So we gotta get ready for Critmas. So we're
going to go offline and back up so we can make

735
01:06:17,385 --> 01:06:21,579
sure we get this episode uploaded to you guys on
Monday. The longer the video, the longer it takes

736
01:06:21,579 --> 01:06:25,929
to transcode and sometimes makes it take longer to
get up, so we'll be going offline and then

737
01:06:25,929 --> 01:06:27,379
right back up for Critmas, guys.

738
01:06:27,379 --> 01:06:28,669
LAURA: Yay!

739
01:06:28,669 --> 01:06:33,275
MATT: See you back here in just a few minutes,
guys. Don't leave. We'll be here!
