00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,156
If you only know one thing about Dungeons & Dragons

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,596
other then the fact that it involves both dungeons and dragons

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:10,456
it's probably that it utilizes a twenty-sided die

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,396
or d20.

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,876
This is the die the entire system revolves around

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,056
and the die you will be rolling the most.

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,196
This polyhedral punk determines

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,036
all of your successes and failures in the game

9
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,941
with twenty being the best

10
00:00:24,965 --> 00:00:28,056
and one being the absolute worst!

17
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,756
I hear a lot of beginners ask

18
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,656
"How do I know when to roll?"

19
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,236
Well, here's the beauty of it:

20
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,236
most of the time, you don't have to!

21
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,396
That's for the Dungeon Master, or DM, to decide

22
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,536
all you have to worry about is what your character wants to do

23
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,776
and how you wanna do it.

24
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,816
If it seems like a challenge in needs of Fate's opinion

25
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,176
the DM will ask you to roll a d20

26
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,416
the outcome depends on how tough it would be

27
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,596
for your character to achieve the goal at hand

28
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:11,296
and, of course, whatever the cursed dice have to say.

29
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,896
You wanna to attack something? Roll that d20

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,236
and your resident DM will let you know how hard you hit it

31
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,316
or how bad you biffed it.

32
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:24,356
However you're not left alone with the Dungeon Master's wrath and the smite of the dice

33
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:27,736
you're a badass hero, and you have a lot of things that you're good at

34
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,236
and...possibly a few things that you're bad at

35
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:35,156
and those things are all based around six abilities scores:

36
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:38,096
Strength, Dexterity, Constitution

37
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,756
Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.

38
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,257
(Ting)

39
00:01:42,281 --> 00:01:46,736
These scores will give you modifiers, either bonuses or penalties,

40
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,236
that you add to your rolls to help determine

41
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:53,176
if your rogue sticks the landing on that stealthy back-flip into the shadows

42
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,436
or falls flat on their face (awkward giggle)

43
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,376
We'll get more into these six scores in another video.

44
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,916
Now, how about these six other dice?

45
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:06,516
Well, the number after the 'd' represents the sides of the die

46
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:13,116
You have a d4, a d6, d8, d10, and a d12

47
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,111
These dice are primarily used for damage or healing

48
00:02:16,135 --> 00:02:19,036
and will generally correspond with what weapon you're using

49
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,516
or how powerful a spell might be.

50
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,216
If you see a number *before* that letter 'd'

51
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,616
this is how many dice of that type that you roll.

52
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,116
That great-sword does 2d6 damage?

53
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,556
Roll two six-sided dice.

54
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,076
Healing a friend for 3d8 hit points?

55
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,596
Roll three eight-sided die

56
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,296
add up the numbers to see just how powerful that ability was.

57
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,356
If you're currently looking at a set of gaming dice thinking:

58
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:48,376
"What the hell is this one?" It's a percentile die.

59
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,736
Certain classes have abilities that utilize percentage rolls

60
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,396
and you bust out Old Dusty here, along with a d10

61
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,976
and get a percentage out of one hundred.

62
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,416
It's pretty cool, right?

63
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,736
Honestly, percentage rolls don't come up too often

64
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,236
but when they do? Man, are they interesting!

65
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,196
That's you're gaming dice basics

66
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,916
and all we have for you on today's episode of Handbooker Helper.

67
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,576
Now, get out there and roll some dice!

68
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,976
Stay natural, my friends.
