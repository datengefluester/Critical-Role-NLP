NOTE Paragraph

00:00:06.664 --> 00:00:14.064
MARISHA: (laughs) Man, I don't know why we keep
trying really hard.

00:00:14.064 --> 00:00:15.964
MATT: We'll keep trying. We'll make it work.

00:00:15.964 --> 00:00:18.894
MARISHA: We're trying so hard, man, to make this
work!

00:00:18.894 --> 00:00:19.533
MATT: I know!

00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:25.541
MARISHA: Trying so hard. All right, guys, this is
going to be our last attempt, so if this fails

00:00:25.541 --> 00:00:29.053
just know that we love you and we tried.

00:00:29.053 --> 00:00:30.513
MATT: And wish you a very happy Thanksgiving.

00:00:30.513 --> 00:00:31.974
MARISHA: And we wish you a happy Thanksgiving.

00:00:31.974 --> 00:00:33.893
MATT: If this fails, it falls through.

00:00:33.893 --> 00:00:42.744
MARISHA: Yeah, service is quite spotty and we're
slowly leaving civilization even more as we speak.

00:00:42.744 --> 00:00:47.797
MATT: We keep starting when we get to cities and
then pushing into dark areas with no lights.

00:00:48.169 --> 00:00:58.909
MARISHA: And we lose signal. But yes. Happy
Thanksgiving and we can't wait-- it's weird that

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:01.858
tomorrow's Thursday and there's no game.

00:01:01.858 --> 00:01:04.068
MATT: I know, especially where we left it off.
Ugh!

00:01:04.068 --> 00:01:09.918
MARISHA: It's become so ingrained into our system.
Although, in a weird way, it's almost like this

00:01:09.918 --> 00:01:17.750
week, time has been different. I feel like,
normally, the weeks feel so long getting to

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.919
Thursday, but now I think, because I was
anticipating it being a two-week break, I feel

00:01:22.919 --> 00:01:29.878
like this is more of a-- this feels like a halfway
point. I don't know. It's weird to describe, but

00:01:29.878 --> 00:01:31.338
yes.

00:01:31.338 --> 00:01:32.290
MATT: I concur.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.993
MARISHA: You concur.

00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:34.637
MATT: Yes.

00:01:34.637 --> 00:01:42.318
MARISHA: It's good. It's weird. We miss it. Yeah,
I think they are doing a rebroadcast tomorrow,

00:01:42.318 --> 00:01:49.061
actually. So if you guys want to catch up on
Critical Role, or have nothing better to do, or--

00:01:49.061 --> 00:01:53.080
does football still happen on Thanksgiving Day?

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.248
MATT: I'm not the person to ask this.

00:01:55.248 --> 00:02:00.912
MARISHA: If you don't want to watch football, you
can watch Critical Role. Which would be kind of

00:02:00.912 --> 00:02:01.609
a-- what?

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:04.341
MATT: I'm sorry, I have to enjoy the fact that you
turned to me to ask me a football question.

00:02:04.341 --> 00:02:07.218
That's delightful.

00:02:07.218 --> 00:02:15.421
MARISHA: Well, I don't know! Never mind. Three
games. Yes, there's a lot of football happening

00:02:15.712 --> 00:02:16.642
tomorrow. There's always football.

00:02:16.642 --> 00:02:21.690
MATT: You guys can go play your "footsballs," and
your outdoor things.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.972
MARISHA: How about that comic this week, you guys?
How about that comic that came out today? Am I

00:02:26.972 --> 00:02:27.400
right?

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.208
MATT: I need to read it. I haven't.

00:02:30.208 --> 00:02:34.391
MARISHA: I am so in love with it. I'm not going to
lie. Out of all the ones that Taliesin and I have

00:02:34.391 --> 00:02:40.121
written for this arc that are coming up, this one
I was the most excited for and she did not

00:02:40.121 --> 00:02:48.370
disappoint. This is definitely one of my favorite
ones that we came up with and she did a really

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.041
good job on it. I was happy with it.

00:02:53.041 --> 00:02:55.540
MATT: You should be. You're good at writing.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:04.642
MARISHA: I was happy with it. I know. I know that
the comic is really short, but we are making do

00:03:04.642 --> 00:03:15.180
with the budget that we got. So that is what we
were able to get approved in advance.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.320
MATT: That time that the artists have to work on
it, too, for that much turn around.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.981
MARISHA: The time and--

00:03:19.981 --> 00:03:25.732
MATT: If this goes well, we'd like to do more with
it and actually produce. I mean, pie in the sky,

00:03:25.732 --> 00:03:30.851
I'd love to be able to put together an actual
comic based on previous exploits of Vox Machina

00:03:30.851 --> 00:03:37.509
and stuff. That'd be a really fun thing, but it's
also one of those things that is time-consuming

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:38.631
and expensive.

00:03:38.631 --> 00:03:47.391
MARISHA: That's why we've been pushing people so
hard to go look at it because as long as people go

00:03:47.664 --> 00:03:53.522
look at the comic, we can possibly get more comic.
Yeah, the reason why it's so short is because

00:03:53.522 --> 00:04:00.814
that's what we've got to work with right now.
Yeah, for the people who are asking, go to

00:04:00.814 --> 00:04:07.963
geekandsundry.com and we now have a weekly
Critical Role/Vox Machina comic strip. Definitely

00:04:07.963 --> 00:04:08.982
go check it out.

00:04:08.982 --> 00:04:11.863
MATT: They're bite size, four panels each week.

00:04:11.863 --> 00:04:15.914
MARISHA: Yeah, a comic strip! Like Family Ties or
Marmaduke.

00:04:15.914 --> 00:04:17.333
MATT: Family Ties?

00:04:17.333 --> 00:04:20.261
MARISHA: Wait, what did I say? Family Circus is
what I meant!

00:04:20.261 --> 00:04:24.073
MATT: Family Ties was the best comic strip I've
ever seen, I don't know about you guys. The

00:04:24.073 --> 00:04:27.884
crossover with the Avengers was pretty intense,
too. Good to see Michael J. Fox in fighting form.

00:04:27.884 --> 00:04:35.663
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah. Exactly.

00:04:35.663 --> 00:04:37.632
MATT: I'm glad we're maintaining signal. This is
nuts.

00:04:37.632 --> 00:04:42.632
MARISHA: People are saying, someone said, "You
voiced Chrom in Fire Emblem?"

00:04:42.632 --> 00:04:43.734
MATT: Fire Emblem: Awakening, yes.

00:04:43.734 --> 00:04:45.634
MARISHA: They said, "I thought that was Crispin!"

00:04:45.634 --> 00:04:49.162
MATT: No, Crispin voices all the other cooler
characters.

00:04:49.162 --> 00:04:53.719
MARISHA: Yeah. Crispin's everyone else. But he's
Chrom.

00:04:54.224 --> 00:04:57.253
MATT: Thank you for being the wind at my back and
the sword at my side.

00:04:57.253 --> 00:05:07.303
MARISHA: Aw. I have a bird sitter for Dagon, don't
worry. Dagon's: one, not in the car, and two, not

00:05:07.303 --> 00:05:09.104
abandoned or left alone.

00:05:09.104 --> 00:05:12.432
MATT: Yeah, no. Dagon doesn't do well with driving
at all.

00:05:12.432 --> 00:05:13.952
MARISHA: Dagon gets carsick.

00:05:13.952 --> 00:05:16.083
MATT: I know! I didn't know birds could do that.

00:05:16.083 --> 00:05:19.452
MARISHA: Yeah, birds get carsick. I don't know if
you guys know that, but birds get carsick.

00:05:19.452 --> 00:05:22.783
MATT: She starts hyperventilating, she starts
throwing up and we're like, "No!"

00:05:23.173 --> 00:05:32.534
MARISHA: You wouldn't think, but birds get
carsick. Their little equilibrium in their brain,

00:05:32.534 --> 00:05:38.393
they do not like the driving. It gets weird for
them. It's interesting.

00:05:38.393 --> 00:05:41.552
MATT: We have to put her in a little box and cover
her up when we take her to the vet.

00:05:41.552 --> 00:05:48.605
MARISHA: We have to make it dark and I have to be
a shock system and be like, "Don't look outside!"

00:05:48.605 --> 00:05:54.565
People who get sea sickness, it's kind of like
that. Don't look at the horizon, you'll know

00:05:54.836 --> 00:05:57.246
you're driving and then you'll get sick!

00:05:57.246 --> 00:06:03.074
MATT: Oh! I've had a few questions about this I
wanted to alert you guys to. I mentioned the

00:06:03.074 --> 00:06:12.563
updates to the Witch Hunter class. I'm working
on those, a lot of adjustments. Inspiration. A lot

00:06:12.563 --> 00:06:20.331
of it stemmed from the fact that the character
class was sort of inspired through the preparation

00:06:20.331 --> 00:06:25.280
for the Vin Diesel game, but I had to tailor it to
what little information I had on his character.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.929
The title "Witch Hunter" was to tie into the
movie, but it was also a misnomer as the class

00:06:29.929 --> 00:06:34.220
didn't really have much to do with witches, that
was just one of its quarries. Some of the

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:38.719
abilities were created based on what little
information I had about the trailers of the film.

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:45.389
Once that film, that whole promo event left, I
wanted to recreate the class in a way that was

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:51.089
wholly my own and wasn't quite so directly
affiliated to that film and that whole event. I

00:06:51.089 --> 00:06:57.854
changed the name, currently going with the theme
of calling it a Blood Hunter. The idea being that

00:06:57.854 --> 00:07:07.604
it's essentially a warrior or a martial class that
is so in-tune with its own physical vitality, its

00:07:07.604 --> 00:07:15.154
life force that it sacrifices and utilizes it. Its
Blood Rite is now called the Crimson Rite. It gets

00:07:15.154 --> 00:07:20.297
Blood Curses, which you can gain more as it levels
up and those allow it to curse and manipulate

00:07:20.297 --> 00:07:26.637
enemies' psychologies in small ways, as well as
their own. Imagine a martial class Blood Magus, if

00:07:26.637 --> 00:07:32.101
you will. So instead of being all magic-based,
it's about enhancing and altering, martial

00:07:32.101 --> 00:07:40.507
prowess, and small manipulations of the enemy. The
Blood Hunter, I'm calling it, should have some

00:07:40.507 --> 00:07:44.447
updates coming soon. I'm getting some great notes
back. I'm actually getting some notes back from

00:07:44.447 --> 00:07:50.368
some folks at Wizards about it. That way when I
put it out, I can have it pretty well-balanced

00:07:50.368 --> 00:07:54.846
based on community feedback and official company
feedback and I can feel a little more comfortable

00:07:54.846 --> 00:08:00.175
about throwing out in the ether to be torn apart
by the sharks. Hopefully, I'll have that for you

00:08:00.175 --> 00:08:03.345
guys soon in some way, shape, or form. It's been a
lot of fun to--

00:08:03.345 --> 00:08:06.586
MARISHA: Yeah, retool!

00:08:06.586 --> 00:08:11.106
MATT: Homebrew, man. It's a process.

00:08:11.106 --> 00:08:16.210
MARISHA: Yeah, he was saying "Blood Hunter," by
the way, for anyone, "Blood Hunter," not void

00:08:16.481 --> 00:08:19.410
hunter or demon hunter. Blood Hunter.

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:25.002
MATT: Blood Hunter, as the essence of their
capabilities are through forbidden blood magic and

00:08:25.002 --> 00:08:28.888
the ability to sacrifice their own vitality or
manipulate their own vitality to enhance their

00:08:28.888 --> 00:08:35.159
abilities. The blood is the very central theme to
a lot of their capabilities and magical prowess as

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:41.639
part of their martial enhancement. That's the
theme! Other than that, there are still creature

00:08:41.639 --> 00:08:49.619
hunters, they're still very much against demons,
fey, dark fey, against ghosts and undead and stuff

00:08:49.619 --> 00:08:54.190
like that. Those things still align there. But the
core of that class is now based around

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:57.789
manipulation of its own vitality. There you go!

00:08:57.789 --> 00:09:07.510
MARISHA: Word! I wasn't looking at questions
because I was trying to get good camera angles of

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:08.361
your face.

00:09:08.361 --> 00:09:10.320
MATT: That's an impossible attempt.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.770
MARISHA: That's not true!

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:15.771
MATT: I appreciate your candor.

00:09:15.771 --> 00:09:19.862
MARISHA: Someone else had a good question right
before and I was like, "Ooh that's a good

00:09:19.862 --> 00:09:22.330
"question! I'm going to have to remember that one."
And then I forgot about it.

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:23.791
MATT: Oh no! No!

00:09:23.791 --> 00:09:25.988
MARISHA: I don't know.

00:09:25.988 --> 00:09:29.705
MATT: Whoever it was, if you had a good question,
ask it again!

00:09:30.054 --> 00:09:35.415
MARISHA: If you had a good question, just ask it
again, person who had a good question!

00:09:35.415 --> 00:09:37.437
MATT: Marisha's filtering the chat so I'm able to
drive.

00:09:37.437 --> 00:09:47.054
MARISHA: Yeah. Ooh! That's actually a good
question. Advice for making a tiefling cleric.

00:09:47.054 --> 00:09:54.235
MATT: Ooh! There's some great domains there.
There's the trickery domain, there's the war

00:09:54.235 --> 00:10:01.986
domain, and it depends on the theme of-- if you
want to truly embrace your demonic heritage or if

00:10:01.986 --> 00:10:10.864
you shun it entirely and your pious development as
a character is more to try and make recompense for

00:10:10.864 --> 00:10:13.485
what you deem yourself as a cursed bloodline.

00:10:13.485 --> 00:10:16.102
MARISHA: Generally, really, there's no wrong
answers.

00:10:16.102 --> 00:10:16.595
MATT: No.

00:10:16.595 --> 00:10:21.904
MARISHA: People need to just know that when
building a character, there's no wrong answers as

00:10:21.904 --> 00:10:23.724
long as you're able to justify it.

00:10:23.724 --> 00:10:29.124
MATT: Yeah. Find a cool story aspect, a nice hook,
and a reason for why you built a character the way

00:10:29.124 --> 00:10:34.476
you did. No matter how weird they are. People
complain that multiclassing isn't as powerful in

00:10:34.476 --> 00:10:40.369
the long run as sticking to a single class. From a
numbers standpoint, maybe, to a negligible degree,

00:10:40.369 --> 00:10:45.825
really, but it's all about what's making what's
interesting to you to play in a game. If you have

00:10:45.825 --> 00:10:51.167
a campaign that's in the min/maxing dungeon crawl,
make something that works in that degree.

00:10:51.167 --> 00:10:57.258
MARISHA: I really like what Taliesin had to say
about it in his interview that he did, the written

00:10:57.258 --> 00:11:06.856
interviews that we did on Geek & Sundry. He said
his method for making characters is he always

00:11:06.856 --> 00:11:12.736
tries to make someone he'd want to hang out with
because, especially if you're starting a

00:11:12.736 --> 00:11:22.276
long-running campaign, you are going to be with
this person for a very long time. So make someone

00:11:22.276 --> 00:11:28.105
you'd want to hang out with. I think that's a
really good tip.

00:11:28.105 --> 00:11:32.453
MATT: You could make a punk or an asshole to a
degree, as long as there are some redeeming

00:11:32.453 --> 00:11:33.334
quality to them.

00:11:33.334 --> 00:11:34.701
MARISHA: Oh, I have a lot of friends who are
assholes!

00:11:34.701 --> 00:11:38.767
MATT: Because the rest of your party has to hang
out with you for that time as well.

00:11:38.767 --> 00:11:39.338
MARISHA: Right!

00:11:39.338 --> 00:11:43.496
MATT: Unless you all agree that you want to make a
party of terrible people and do a short-run evil

00:11:43.496 --> 00:11:44.787
campaign, maybe.

00:11:44.787 --> 00:11:49.666
MARISHA: Scanlan is kind of a scummy douchebag,
but--

00:11:49.666 --> 00:11:51.557
MATT: A loveable, scummy douchebag!

00:11:51.557 --> 00:11:54.056
MARISHA: He's a loveable, scummy douchebag!

00:11:54.056 --> 00:11:59.888
MATT: I have many friends that fall in that same
category that-- I shake my head at them quite

00:12:00.246 --> 00:12:04.536
often, but more often than not, you know there's a
good core there, there's a good person. They just

00:12:04.536 --> 00:12:06.665
have very curious methods.

00:12:06.665 --> 00:12:10.038
MARISHA: Yeah! Everyone has their vices.

00:12:10.038 --> 00:12:15.648
MATT: Mind you, I don't have any friends who
crapped on beds or anything. That I know of.

00:12:15.648 --> 00:12:19.176
MARISHA: That you know of.

00:12:19.176 --> 00:12:20.156
MATT: That I know of.

00:12:20.156 --> 00:12:31.450
MARISHA: That you know of. Totally. Yeah. Druid
second place? Druid second place to who? Nobody.

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:32.790
That's what I say.

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:33.910
MATT: Oh snap.

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:40.112
MARISHA: What what! Those are fighting words. Once
again, guys, I apologize if we lose service; we're

00:12:40.442 --> 00:12:47.951
driving in the desert. I'm looking at my phone for
service. So if we lose service here soon, happy

00:12:47.951 --> 00:13:01.402
Thanksgiving and we love you guys so much and
we'll be back soonish. "What's the deal for this

00:13:01.402 --> 00:13:08.024
"month's Critmas?" It's happening on not this next
episode, but the episode after.

00:13:08.024 --> 00:13:12.243
MATT: The first Thursday of the month. We were
going to try to do--

00:13:12.243 --> 00:13:17.632
MARISHA: But we're pushing it this week because
first Thursday of the month is next Thursday.

00:13:17.632 --> 00:13:23.272
MATT: Right. Not this one, not next one. Yeah, so
it'd be two. We're pushing it back to the second

00:13:23.272 --> 00:13:29.372
week this month because we can't do the Thursday
before Critmas.

00:13:29.372 --> 00:13:31.162
MARISHA: Christmas.

00:13:31.162 --> 00:13:36.064
MATT: We're not playing Christmas Eve and then we
can't do the week before because that's also the

00:13:36.313 --> 00:13:42.223
opening night of Star Wars and pretty much the
entire crew, as well as most everyone we know will

00:13:42.223 --> 00:13:47.314
be out that night to see that. So we're going to
play, we're going to end as close to 10:00 as we

00:13:47.314 --> 00:13:50.376
can, and then let everyone go early. So we're
going to be doing our Critmas a week later than we

00:13:50.376 --> 00:13:54.175
normally would be, so it'll be the second Thursday
of December is the current plan.

00:13:54.175 --> 00:14:01.925
MARISHA: Be looking out for the website because
I'm going to be putting out a Critter's Guide for

00:14:01.925 --> 00:14:12.678
Critmas here very soon. So yes, to help guide
people because we've gotten a lot of questions on

00:14:12.678 --> 00:14:20.375
what to do and what to get. One of the things
that's going to be talked about a lot in there is

00:14:20.375 --> 00:14:26.926
all of the charities that we all really like
supporting because as much as we like stuff, we

00:14:26.926 --> 00:14:32.233
really like it when people give to other
charities, especially give to people in our name.

00:14:32.233 --> 00:14:35.245
People have been doing that more and more and we
really like that.

00:14:35.245 --> 00:14:43.436
MATT: It's a strange thing because on one hand,
it's a really wonderful thing that you guys share

00:14:43.436 --> 00:14:50.665
with us your passion and your interest by sending
things, which we never expected, asked for, or

00:14:50.665 --> 00:14:57.376
thought would happen. It's a really cool
experience! At the same time, it's also very

00:14:57.376 --> 00:15:04.587
strange to be receiving so many gifts to an extent
because we're just people. We would like to

00:15:04.587 --> 00:15:10.766
redirect some of that positivity towards great
causes and stuff, as opposed to having to buy a

00:15:10.766 --> 00:15:15.026
lot of things necessarily. Crafts and things you
want to make, music or art, all of that stuff is

00:15:15.026 --> 00:15:21.316
fantastic. Another great avenue that we really
appreciate is giving to charities and supporting,

00:15:21.316 --> 00:15:26.286
Like the animal rescue charities are great. The
person that adopted that bear for Laura was great.

00:15:26.287 --> 00:15:30.449
MARISHA: Someone adopted a bear and then we
recently-- we haven't talked about it on-stream

00:15:30.668 --> 00:15:40.291
yet, but we got somebody who donated a bunch of
seeds in our name. Bought seeds for farmers. It's

00:15:40.291 --> 00:15:51.243
a charity, a non-profit organization that buys
seeds and crops for farmers who might have lost

00:15:51.243 --> 00:15:58.713
their crops for the year due to drought or plant
disease or extreme weather, or anything that can

00:15:58.713 --> 00:16:08.673
happen to these poor farmers that can completely
ruin their year if they lose their entire crop. So

00:16:08.673 --> 00:16:13.738
this is an organization that will donate fresh
crops and fresh seeds to farmers who might have

00:16:13.738 --> 00:16:17.980
lost their crops. Coming from a farming family--

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:19.928
MATT: And a druid.

00:16:19.928 --> 00:16:27.169
MARISHA: And a druid, that definitely speaks to me
because I know how much that sucks and I know what

00:16:27.169 --> 00:16:28.600
it's like when your family--

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:29.809
MATT: Due to blight.

00:16:29.809 --> 00:16:36.182
MARISHA: --loses-- yes! Due to blight. Exactly.
It's awful when you lose your crops due to blight

00:16:36.182 --> 00:16:44.582
and the poor farmers in our country-- poor farmers
everywhere are not appreciated enough.

00:16:44.582 --> 00:16:46.212
MATT: Think of Whitestone.

00:16:46.212 --> 00:16:54.701
MARISHA: Look at Whitestone! Yeah! Especially
considering that farmers keep us alive. So farmers

00:16:54.701 --> 00:17:06.070
are awesome. Stuff like that is a great cause to
donate to that we always appreciate. Oh, that's

00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:12.510
awesome! Tuk said there's somebody-- a local
charity that buys Christmas trees for families.

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:15.257
Correct me if I'm wrong on that. The chat just
went really fast.

00:17:15.257 --> 00:17:17.499
MATT: That's really cool!

00:17:17.972 --> 00:17:26.588
MARISHA: That's really rad. Yeah. I like that.
We've really enjoyed giving back to 826 and all that

00:17:26.588 --> 00:17:32.550
stuff has been so rewarding. All the Extra Life
campaign, going and visiting the Children's

00:17:32.801 --> 00:17:42.002
Hospital is amazing. It's been so great to
actually give back in a way that-- you sometimes

00:17:42.002 --> 00:17:48.454
feel like you don't necessarily have the power to
all the time in your day to day life, so this--

00:17:48.454 --> 00:17:55.332
MATT: We all empower each other, that's what so
crazy about this community. Everyone supports each

00:17:55.332 --> 00:18:01.024
other to such an amazing degree. We're just a
channel for some of that positivity.

00:18:01.024 --> 00:18:05.422
MARISHA: That's what it was! That's what the
person was saying earlier! The really good

00:18:05.422 --> 00:18:14.650
question that I remembered! Oh god! Kit Buss and
Rat Queens, because that is public because someone

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:21.960
brought that up in the announcements. Speaking of
this whole crazy escapade doing amazing things for

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:30.721
people. Yeah! Kit got contacted by Kurtis Wiebe
who is the writer and creator of Rat Queens, whom

00:18:30.721 --> 00:18:38.493
I know you guys have Laura and all the rest of us
talk about it on the show all the time. Kit is

00:18:38.493 --> 00:18:48.152
actually going to be doing the art for a Rat
Queens webcomic! Which is fucking awesome and

00:18:48.152 --> 00:19:00.263
amazing. Yeah! I'm so glad because she's earned
it, beyond earned it.

00:19:00.263 --> 00:19:05.201
MATT: It's so cool when good people get together
and get to do good things.

00:19:05.201 --> 00:19:09.113
MARISHA: And all because of Critical Role! It's
crazy! Because of our dumb D&D game!

00:19:09.113 --> 00:19:10.891
MATT: Because of her amazing talent, but--

00:19:10.891 --> 00:19:15.772
MARISHA: That connection happened because--

00:19:15.772 --> 00:19:18.472
MATT: It's become this weird hub for a lot of
things that are really cool.

00:19:18.472 --> 00:19:29.701
MARISHA: Yeah, it's awesome. "Yay for Kit's fake
accent!" I know. Maybe one day she'll learn how to

00:19:29.701 --> 00:19:38.043
do a proper British accent like Liam. Maybe, or
you. Yeah.

00:19:38.043 --> 00:19:42.572
MATT: No pressure having a real Brit all of a
sudden play D&D with you and all of your

00:19:42.842 --> 00:19:43.752
fake-accented characters.

00:19:43.752 --> 00:19:49.877
MARISHA: And then she comes on and busts out a
Russian accent. What?! She's fucking awesome.

00:19:49.877 --> 00:20:07.697
Let's see, what else do we have? Questions. "Liam
does the best Grog." People doing their Grog

00:20:07.697 --> 00:20:21.149
impressions has become a new thing. It's become a
new thing. Yeah. Oh no! It looks maybe--
