00:00:00,334 --> 00:00:10,504
(no audible dialogue)

2
00:00:11,067 --> 00:00:14,067
MATT: My name is Matthew Mercer,
Dungeon Master for the show.

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,100
Welcome to the
chaos of this evening.

4
00:00:16,133 --> 00:00:18,901
Before we get into
our actual game story,

5
00:00:18,934 --> 00:00:21,334
and the thread of what has
transpired in recent events,

6
00:00:21,367 --> 00:00:23,434
we're gonna go through
our quick announcements.

7
00:00:23,467 --> 00:00:27,501
First and foremost, tonight's
episode is sponsored by us!

8
00:00:27,534 --> 00:00:29,501
Sponsored by the new year.

9
00:00:29,534 --> 00:00:31,200
Sponsored by, hopefully,

10
00:00:31,234 --> 00:00:33,801
have our sponsor
contracts finalized soon,

11
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:35,667
and we can have an
actual sponsor soon,

12
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:37,234
but until then,
we are sponsored

13
00:00:37,267 --> 00:00:41,100
by you awesome people who
come and watch the show.

14
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:42,634
I think Sam had
prepared a bit.

15
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:45,067
SAM: What-- I, yeah,
I prepared a bit.

16
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,901
That's pretty much it.

17
00:00:46,934 --> 00:00:48,667
Now, I'm gonna need
a little quiet,

18
00:00:48,701 --> 00:00:50,968
because we've gotten a
lot of feedback from fans,

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,384
and so, this new feature
we're gonna roll out.

20
00:00:53,384 --> 00:00:55,033
We're gonna have
a telephone number

21
00:00:55,067 --> 00:00:57,000
that people can call
and complain to,

22
00:00:57,033 --> 00:00:58,767
so I just wanted to--

23
00:00:58,801 --> 00:01:01,453
I think I can use this mic
if everyone can be quiet.

24
00:01:01,453 --> 00:01:04,733
I'm gonna just record our
outgoing message for the--

25
00:01:04,766 --> 00:01:08,267
the new phone line that
we're setting up right now.

26
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,067
So stand by.

27
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,868
Thank you for calling
Critical Role customer support.

28
00:01:12,901 --> 00:01:16,467
We value from your feedback and
want to improve your experience.

29
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:18,278
If you're calling
to argue against

30
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:21,801
one of Matthew Mercer's many,
many rule violations, press one.

31
00:01:21,834 --> 00:01:23,100
If you're calling to cry

32
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:25,534
because Ashley Johnson
isn't on this episode,

33
00:01:25,567 --> 00:01:28,801
mash your forehead into
your number pad repeatedly.

34
00:01:28,834 --> 00:01:31,300
If you're calling to lodge a
complaint about Marisha Ray

35
00:01:31,334 --> 00:01:32,634
or the character of Keyleth,

36
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:34,734
or how nothing she
ever does is cool,

37
00:01:34,767 --> 00:01:36,334
press three.

38
00:01:36,367 --> 00:01:39,267
You will be given five minutes
to rant and don't worry.

39
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:43,634
Your message will make Marisha
feel like shit within 24 hours.

40
00:01:43,667 --> 00:01:45,567
Quiet, guys.

41
00:01:45,601 --> 00:01:47,100
If you would
like to complain about

42
00:01:47,133 --> 00:01:49,100
the technical
aspects of the Twitch stream,

43
00:01:49,133 --> 00:01:51,901
please hang up and
call 1-800-hashtag

44
00:01:51,934 --> 00:01:54,934
W-E-K-N-O-W.

45
00:01:54,968 --> 00:01:57,901
If you are offended by something
Sam Riegel said on the stream,

46
00:01:57,934 --> 00:01:59,801
you can go
fuck yourself.

47
00:01:59,834 --> 00:02:01,100
Thank you for
your support.

48
00:02:01,133 --> 00:02:02,334
Okay, that's it.

49
00:02:02,367 --> 00:02:03,434
MATT: Good, good.

50
00:02:03,467 --> 00:02:07,968
(laughter, applause)

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,032
(talking over each other)

52
00:02:11,067 --> 00:02:13,934
LIAM: Pick up.

53
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:15,737
Can I just, on behalf
on all of us?

54
00:02:15,737 --> 00:02:19,501
(humming)

55
00:02:19,534 --> 00:02:21,167
MATT: We miss you, Ashley.

56
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,968
We miss you.

57
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,257
LAURA: Always, always.

58
00:02:24,257 --> 00:02:25,868
TRAVIS: Start crying before
the show starts.

59
00:02:25,901 --> 00:02:27,340
MARISHA: I look forward to
all the voicemails.

60
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,767
-SAM: Uh-huh.
-LAURA: Yeah, so many.

61
00:02:28,801 --> 00:02:29,767
LIAM: It's already full.

62
00:02:29,801 --> 00:02:31,501
TALIESIN: Yeah.

63
00:02:31,534 --> 00:02:33,501
It's like our very own
This American Life episode.

64
00:02:33,534 --> 00:02:35,801
-I'm so excited.
-MARISHA: Yeah.

65
00:02:35,834 --> 00:02:38,567
MATT: Thank you, Sam, for
that fantastic message.

66
00:02:38,601 --> 00:02:41,100
LIAM: Wow!

67
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:42,767
MATT: We have some-- I think,
some merch updates

68
00:02:42,767 --> 00:02:44,133
if you want to
take that, Laura.

69
00:02:44,167 --> 00:02:45,400
LAURA: Oh, yes, we do!

70
00:02:45,434 --> 00:02:48,267
So if you guys check
the store right now,

71
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,200
there should be some Strongjaw
Ale shirts available.

72
00:02:52,234 --> 00:02:54,200
I was getting some tweets
about it, that, you know,

73
00:02:54,234 --> 00:02:56,033
we hadn't put those in
store for a long time,

74
00:02:56,067 --> 00:02:57,734
so, we made some more
and put them in the store.

75
00:02:57,767 --> 00:02:59,371
Along with the
Gilmore shirts, and the

76
00:02:59,371 --> 00:03:00,634
How do you want
to do this?

77
00:03:00,667 --> 00:03:01,934
and the regular
logo shirt.

78
00:03:01,968 --> 00:03:04,400
All of those things
available plus there are some

79
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,000
How do you want to
do this? hoodies left

80
00:03:06,033 --> 00:03:08,100
from the pre-order stock
that we had a long time ago,

81
00:03:08,133 --> 00:03:11,000
so, there's a few of those
left in the store, and...

82
00:03:11,033 --> 00:03:12,000
(ding)

83
00:03:12,033 --> 00:03:13,567
I have a tweet.

84
00:03:13,601 --> 00:03:15,868
Sorry.

85
00:03:15,901 --> 00:03:19,234
Sorry about that, and
we also have these new,

86
00:03:19,267 --> 00:03:20,501
wait, where'd I put it?

87
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,033
-LIAM: On the back of your book.
-LAURA: Where's my book?

88
00:03:22,067 --> 00:03:24,434
-LIAM: This is it.
-LAURA: Oh, I have it out.

89
00:03:24,467 --> 00:03:27,367
We have vinyl stickers now,
you guys.

90
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,767
Aren't they so spiffy?

91
00:03:28,801 --> 00:03:30,601
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, look at it.

92
00:03:30,634 --> 00:03:32,601
LAURA: Yeah, I'm excited
about those, so those are--

93
00:03:32,634 --> 00:03:33,601
Those are here.

94
00:03:33,634 --> 00:03:34,601
Those are in the
store for you.

95
00:03:34,634 --> 00:03:36,567
-SAM: For sale?
-LAURA: For sale, Sam!

96
00:03:36,601 --> 00:03:38,534
TRAVIS: Do we get them for free,
do we get them?

97
00:03:38,567 --> 00:03:39,734

-LIAM: Heavily discounted.
-LAURA: Here you go.

99
00:03:41,367 --> 00:03:42,934
-LIAM: Heavily discounted.
-LAURA: Do you guys want some?

100
00:03:42,968 --> 00:03:44,000
MARISHA: Yeah!

101
00:03:44,033 --> 00:03:46,767
I'll put it on
my white car.

102
00:03:46,801 --> 00:03:49,200
(laughter)

103
00:03:49,234 --> 00:03:51,133
LAURA: So, yeah, there's
all that stuff.

104
00:03:51,167 --> 00:03:53,300
SAM: Amazing.

105
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:54,901
-TRAVIS: Those are awesome.
-LAURA: Yeah.

106
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:56,100
And we have
more hats too.

107
00:03:56,133 --> 00:03:57,467
There's hats again.

108
00:03:57,501 --> 00:03:58,634
All these things, you guys.

109
00:03:58,667 --> 00:03:59,701
Just so many things.

110
00:03:59,734 --> 00:04:01,701
-TALIESIN: Loot!
-MATT: We're trying to keep up.

111
00:04:01,734 --> 00:04:03,734
LAURA: Yeah, we're trying to do away
with, like, the whole, you know,

112
00:04:03,767 --> 00:04:06,267
pre-order and wait a really
long time to get your stuff,

113
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,634
so, now we're trying
to keep things in stock

114
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:08,901
so you can
actually buy it.

115
00:04:08,934 --> 00:04:10,133
TRAVIS: Yeah, trying to get
it to you sooner.

116
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,501
LAURA: Yeah!

117
00:04:11,534 --> 00:04:13,667
MATT: Alright, thank you, Laura.

118
00:04:13,701 --> 00:04:15,534
Also want to mention for those
who want to check it out.

119
00:04:15,567 --> 00:04:17,767
We've been running it
for a few months now,

120
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:19,834
but we have our
Talks Machina

121

that's part of his charm.

our way through

130
00:04:40,834 --> 00:04:42,667
trying to explain
our inane actions

131
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:43,734
in the dice
role-playing RPG

132
00:04:43,767 --> 00:04:45,734

Anyway, check that out.

Anybody else have anything
else they want to talk about

135
00:04:48,501 --> 00:04:51,934
or mention or--
or say something?

136

MARISHA: You guys want
to say anything?

139
00:04:55,334 --> 00:04:56,434
You didn't say
anything this time.

140
00:04:56,467 --> 00:04:58,267
Do you want to say how
much you love everybody?

00:06:50,434 --> 00:06:52,133
in search of the
Vestiges of Divergence.

160
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:53,834
Magical artifacts that
can help outfit them

161
00:06:53,868 --> 00:06:56,667
for their coming struggle
against the Chroma Conclave,

162
00:06:56,701 --> 00:06:59,200
a group of chromatic
dragons that had terrorized

163
00:06:59,234 --> 00:07:01,801
and conquered the
Tal'Dorei countryside

164
00:07:01,834 --> 00:07:03,567
for quite some time now.

165
00:07:03,601 --> 00:07:04,934
At the end of
this venture,

166
00:07:04,968 --> 00:07:07,400
you've all, acquiring
your relics of power,

167
00:07:07,434 --> 00:07:09,234
your levels of experience,

168
00:07:09,267 --> 00:07:11,801
and the allies you've amassed
through this journey,

169
00:07:11,834 --> 00:07:14,367
converged upon the central
capitol city of Emon

170
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,767
in hopes of
finally defeating

171
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:17,968
and destroying
Thordak, The Cinder King.

172
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,501
You made a tenuous
relationship

173
00:07:19,534 --> 00:07:20,834
with a member
of the Conclave,

174
00:07:20,868 --> 00:07:24,601
Raishan, the Diseased
Deceiver, the green dragon,

175
00:07:24,634 --> 00:07:28,267
and after killing the other
three members of the Conclave,

176
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,467
you went in with
armies at your back,

177
00:07:30,501 --> 00:07:32,467
Ashari in the sky,

178
00:07:32,501 --> 00:07:33,767
who laid siege to the city

179
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:35,434
as you snuck beneath
the streets of Emon,

180
00:07:35,467 --> 00:07:39,000
emerging on the outskirts
of the Cloudtop district

181
00:07:39,033 --> 00:07:42,501
through the help of your two
allies: Zahra and Kashaw.

182
00:07:42,534 --> 00:07:44,534
You managed to bypass
two waiting fire giants,

183
00:07:44,567 --> 00:07:46,634
push straight into the center

184
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:49,300
of the mostly ruined
cloud topped district

185
00:07:49,334 --> 00:07:51,567
where you confronted
Thordak, The Cinder King,

186
00:07:51,601 --> 00:07:56,300
in his large, swollen powerful,
primordial red dragon form.

187
00:07:56,334 --> 00:07:57,834
(shivers)

188
00:07:57,868 --> 00:07:59,200
LAURA: Sorry.

189
00:07:59,234 --> 00:08:01,934
-TALIESIN: I was with you.
-TRAVIS: Gross.

190
00:08:01,968 --> 00:08:03,200
MATT: It's a favored
enemy, right?

191
00:08:03,234 --> 00:08:04,734
Just checking.

192
00:08:08,701 --> 00:08:12,667
You came prepared with--
with allies at your sides

193
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:15,200
and full power
you tore into Thordak

194
00:08:15,234 --> 00:08:17,217
and while many
blows were sustained

195
00:08:17,217 --> 00:08:18,667
on both sides
of the fray,

196
00:08:18,701 --> 00:08:21,701
Thordak fell on
the battlefield.

197
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:24,033
In those moments,
as Thordak attempted

198
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:26,834
to retreat into his lair,

199
00:08:26,868 --> 00:08:31,234
you, Vax, gave chase
and slew the dragon

200
00:08:31,267 --> 00:08:33,767
using Whisper
in your grasp.

201
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:38,167
As a few of you came up
behind, Raishan, as well,

202
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,267
asked as part of the
accord you had made

203
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:43,734
to be given some time
with the corpse of Thordak.

204
00:08:43,767 --> 00:08:47,033
It was decided that
this was not to be allowed.

205
00:08:47,067 --> 00:08:50,534
She was not to be trusted,
and an attack was made on Raishan.

206
00:08:50,567 --> 00:08:52,100
Though Raishan
also had made

207
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:55,801
a few unique choices of
her own leading up to it.

208
00:08:55,834 --> 00:09:00,434
This led to a confrontation in
Thordak's lair beneath the city

209
00:09:00,467 --> 00:09:03,400
where you
all nearly got

210
00:09:03,434 --> 00:09:07,734
your asses
handed to you.

211
00:09:07,767 --> 00:09:11,334
By-- by a
well-prepared Raishan.

212
00:09:11,367 --> 00:09:13,801
However, in the midst
of this battle,

213
00:09:13,834 --> 00:09:17,868
you did summon your
ally, J'Mon Sa Ord.

214
00:09:17,901 --> 00:09:19,934
They're the leader
of Ank'Harel,

215
00:09:19,968 --> 00:09:21,767
the distant city on the
continent of Marquet,

216
00:09:21,801 --> 00:09:25,300
and a brass dragon, who
upon arriving in this fray,

217
00:09:25,334 --> 00:09:27,334
full health and
ready to fight,

218
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:29,901
was enough of a threat
to drive Raishan off

219
00:09:29,934 --> 00:09:32,567
in her damaged form before
she could finish you off

220
00:09:32,601 --> 00:09:34,167
in your-- the
state you were in.

221
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,267
SAM: So, it was worth it.

222
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,267
TALIESIN: Yeah, it was
definitely worth it.

223
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,267
LAURA: Yeah!

224
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,000
TALIESIN: Yeah, it was worth it.

225
00:09:39,033 --> 00:09:41,434
MATT: However, you were
then kept at bay

226
00:09:41,467 --> 00:09:44,934
by a wall of force
as Raishan took two

227
00:09:44,968 --> 00:09:49,634
of Thordak's strangely
existing eggs

228
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:53,067
and flew into a tunnel
towards the corpse of Thordak

229
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,734
and then disappeared in
a flash of purple energy

230
00:09:55,767 --> 00:09:57,300
before the wall dropped

231
00:09:57,334 --> 00:09:59,767
and you all just arrived
halfway through the tunnel

232
00:09:59,801 --> 00:10:01,901
where the corpse
of Thordak once lay

233
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,968
to find it missing
along with Raishan

234
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,701
and the eggs that
she had gathered.

235
00:10:06,734 --> 00:10:08,567
And that was where
we had left off.

236
00:10:08,601 --> 00:10:12,667
So, as the rest of your
party begins running up,

237
00:10:12,701 --> 00:10:15,534
winded, bloodied
and still reeling

238
00:10:15,567 --> 00:10:18,467
from the intensity of the
battle you just fought,

239
00:10:18,501 --> 00:10:21,167
you have the intense
heat of a nearby cavern,

240
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,400
the hints of-- of cracked
red-hot Earth and rock

241
00:10:24,434 --> 00:10:26,634
that are kind of protruding
in small sections.

242
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,434
The sweat just
pouring down your face.

243
00:10:28,467 --> 00:10:30,067
You run up and
you can see the trail.

244
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,701
The pool of blood that once
was driven by the wounds

245
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:38,000
left by your blade at the side
of Thordak's corpse-- missing.

246
00:10:38,033 --> 00:10:40,434
The impact crater
of Thordak's landing

247
00:10:40,467 --> 00:10:44,334
still carved into the
side of this curved tunnel.

248
00:10:44,367 --> 00:10:46,834
You see, as
Kima rushes up.

249
00:10:46,868 --> 00:10:49,200
Out of breath,
you see Gilmore rush up

250
00:10:49,234 --> 00:10:50,434
and push his hair 
out of his face

251
00:10:50,467 --> 00:10:51,801
and there's a
moment of silence

252
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:55,968
as you all kind of take
in what has just transpired.

253
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,767
What do you want to do?

254
00:10:58,801 --> 00:11:00,534
TRAVIS: Using my magic,
can I detect

255
00:11:00,567 --> 00:11:04,400
which direction
the beast fled?

256
00:11:04,434 --> 00:11:07,267
-MATT: No.
-TRAVIS: Okay.

257
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,100
I don't know anything.

258
00:11:09,133 --> 00:11:10,367
LAURA: Should we get,
I don't know,

259
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,033
does it matter to
get any of his blood?

260
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:13,968
Maybe we can
track him easier?

261
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,267
-MARISHA: Yeah.
-LAURA: The body?

262
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,300
SAM: Thordak's blood?

263
00:11:18,334 --> 00:11:19,701
LAURA: Yeah, Thordak's blood.

264
00:11:19,734 --> 00:11:21,567
MATT: Okay, so you go
ahead and you pull--

265
00:11:21,601 --> 00:11:23,267
Do you have empty
vials currently?

266
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,734
LAURA: I took a lot of potions,
so I'm assuming so.

267
00:11:25,767 --> 00:11:27,133
MATT: Yes, you would
actually, so yeah.

268
00:11:27,167 --> 00:11:29,567
So you take some
of the-- the mostly

269
00:11:29,601 --> 00:11:32,100
or completely emptied healing
potion vials and collect--

270
00:11:32,133 --> 00:11:33,834
LAURA: I lick,
I lick the bottle

271
00:11:33,834 --> 00:11:37,501
for all the
remaining healing.

272
00:11:37,534 --> 00:11:38,901
-MATT: Little straw.
-LAURA: Like a Capri-Sun.

273
00:11:38,934 --> 00:11:40,601
MATT: Yeah, exactly.

274
00:11:40,634 --> 00:11:43,067
Okay.

275
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,801
MARISHA: I head back
into the chamber

276
00:11:46,834 --> 00:11:49,000
and see if I can
find any of, like,

277
00:11:49,033 --> 00:11:52,668
Raishan's scales or,
like, Raishan blood or...

278
00:11:52,668 --> 00:11:54,234
LAURA: Maybe give it a moment

279
00:11:54,267 --> 00:11:56,801
just to let the lair actions
die down a little bit.

280
00:11:56,834 --> 00:11:58,167
LIAM: What?

281
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,868
LAURA: The-- you know, all the lava
stuff happening in there.

282
00:12:00,901 --> 00:12:03,334
MARISHA: I'll watch from a distance
and make sure that, you know,

283
00:12:03,367 --> 00:12:04,434
it's not boiling over.

284
00:12:04,467 --> 00:12:06,000
-LAURA: It's safe?
-MARISHA: Yeah.

285
00:12:06,033 --> 00:12:07,901
LIAM: I'm gonna limp up to you.

286
00:12:07,934 --> 00:12:09,734
You're burnt all over.

287
00:12:09,767 --> 00:12:11,234
-MARISHA: Yeah.
-LIAM: Hold still for a second.

288
00:12:11,267 --> 00:12:12,300
MARISHA: That really sucks.

289
00:12:12,334 --> 00:12:14,400
I want to assume
that was karma.

290
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:15,801
-Yeah.
-LIAM: Alright.

291
00:12:15,834 --> 00:12:17,033
I do have--

292
00:12:17,067 --> 00:12:18,767
MARISHA: I feel really bad
for that duergar now.

293
00:12:18,801 --> 00:12:19,834
That sucks.

294
00:12:19,868 --> 00:12:21,167
That's a
rough way to go.

295
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,868
(laughter)

296
00:12:22,901 --> 00:12:24,767
LIAM: I cover her mouth with
my hand for a second

297
00:12:24,801 --> 00:12:27,167
and use the last of
Lay on Hands and I--

298
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,167
I checked with CritRoleStats,
I do have ten left.

299
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,467
MATT: Okay.

300
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:32,801
LIAM: So I'm gonna use
eight, eight of those

301
00:12:32,834 --> 00:12:34,901
to heal you up a bit.

302
00:12:34,934 --> 00:12:36,868
-MARISHA: Okay.
-LAURA: Eight whole points.

303
00:12:36,901 --> 00:12:38,734
-LIAM: I only got ten.
-LAURA: Romeo.

304
00:12:38,767 --> 00:12:40,701
What do you do
with those last two?

305
00:12:40,734 --> 00:12:42,200
TALIESIN: I just imagine
like light slapping

306
00:12:42,234 --> 00:12:43,901
in the face
just eight times.

307
00:12:43,934 --> 00:12:46,033
Pow, hit point, hit point.

308
00:12:46,067 --> 00:12:49,234
MARISHA: Lay on Hands,
Lay on Hands.

309
00:12:49,267 --> 00:12:53,667
LIAM: One, two, three,
four, five, six.

310
00:12:53,701 --> 00:12:57,133
MATT: The Oath of Annoyance Paladin.

311
00:12:57,167 --> 00:12:58,834
Coming soon in the
Tal'Dorei campaign book.

312
00:12:58,868 --> 00:13:00,234
LIAM: Thordak died like this.

313
00:13:00,267 --> 00:13:02,133
(laughter)

314
00:13:02,167 --> 00:13:06,300
MATT: Alright, so as
Vax heals you up

315
00:13:06,334 --> 00:13:09,234
with some of the remnants
of his divine power still--

316
00:13:09,267 --> 00:13:12,467
still in his body.

317
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:15,701
Kima's kind of walking
up to Keyleth

318
00:13:15,734 --> 00:13:17,467
and Gilmore goes over
and starts helping you

319
00:13:17,501 --> 00:13:20,834
gather and
separate some of the--

320
00:13:20,868 --> 00:13:22,000
What little blood you can.

321
00:13:22,033 --> 00:13:23,501
A lot of its kind
of just dug into the--

322
00:13:23,534 --> 00:13:26,300
the rock and the dust
but there are a little bit

323
00:13:26,334 --> 00:13:27,901
that you can kind
of pull into it.

324
00:13:27,934 --> 00:13:29,834
It's not too
clustered and filled

325
00:13:29,868 --> 00:13:33,801
with the equivalent
of coffee grinds.

326
00:13:33,834 --> 00:13:35,634
What else are
you guys doing?

327
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:38,667
TALIESIN: Once the lair is safe, I want to
get in and start examining it.

328
00:13:38,701 --> 00:13:39,934
-MARISHA: Same.
-LAURA: Yeah.

329
00:13:39,968 --> 00:13:41,801
MATT: Okay.

330
00:13:41,834 --> 00:13:45,534
It takes, I'd say,
probably a good two minutes

331
00:13:45,567 --> 00:13:49,868
or so before the--

332
00:13:49,901 --> 00:13:53,801
the general tremors of
the lair begin to subside.

333
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:58,200
The presence of Thordak
being long enough removed

334
00:13:58,234 --> 00:14:01,300
that the volcanic
activity begins

335
00:14:01,334 --> 00:14:03,734
to come to a
small, gentle end.

336
00:14:03,767 --> 00:14:05,834
LAURA: Actually, before
we go back in,

337
00:14:05,868 --> 00:14:08,801
can I peek up on
the surface level

338
00:14:08,834 --> 00:14:10,601
and see if it looks like
the fighting has died down?

339
00:14:10,634 --> 00:14:12,234
LIAM: I was just about
to say the same.

340
00:14:12,267 --> 00:14:13,334
MATT: Uh, okay, you
guys go up there?

341
00:14:13,367 --> 00:14:14,367
-LAURA: Yeah.
-LIAM: Yeah.

342
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,801
MATT: Okay.

343
00:14:15,834 --> 00:14:17,124
Everyone else staying down?

344
00:14:17,124 --> 00:14:18,334
-TRAVIS: Yep.
-(Same) Yeah.

345
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,701
MATT: Okay, while you
guys are waiting,

346
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,801
the two of you
rush up to the surface.

347
00:14:21,834 --> 00:14:24,634
The outside of the opening
to Thordak's lair.

348
00:14:24,667 --> 00:14:26,621
Both of you guys
make perception checks.

349
00:14:26,621 --> 00:14:27,655
TRAVIS: Don't die.

350
00:14:32,968 --> 00:14:34,934
-LAURA: Twenty-seven.
-LIAM: Twenty-nine.

351
00:14:34,968 --> 00:14:36,300
MATT: Okay.

352
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:40,067
As you both
peek through the--

353
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,000
the heated clouds
of soot and ash

354
00:14:42,033 --> 00:14:43,868
that are billowing
out from inside,

355
00:14:43,901 --> 00:14:46,868
your vision clarifies and
you can see up into the sky

356
00:14:46,901 --> 00:14:48,834
the thunderstorm that
has been encompassing

357
00:14:48,868 --> 00:14:50,033
the vicinity of Emon.

358
00:14:50,067 --> 00:14:51,667
It's still rolling
and firing off

359
00:14:51,701 --> 00:14:53,284
bolts of lightning
and thunder.

360
00:14:53,284 --> 00:14:54,901
(imitates thunder clap)

361
00:14:54,934 --> 00:14:56,767
In the distance.

362
00:14:56,801 --> 00:14:58,367
It is beginning
to slowly subside

363
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,868
to the size that it began,

364
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:02,334
but you also notice
that the wyvern riders

365
00:15:02,367 --> 00:15:06,234
that once rapidly
swung through the air

366
00:15:06,267 --> 00:15:07,734
are all retreating en masse.

367
00:15:07,767 --> 00:15:10,634
The few that still remain
into the southwest end of,

368
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:13,577
now maybe, about a
half mile off Emon,

369
00:15:13,577 --> 00:15:15,200
and a number of
them are fleeing

370
00:15:15,234 --> 00:15:16,794
and catching up with them.

371
00:15:16,794 --> 00:15:19,934
It looks like they're
being fended off

372
00:15:19,968 --> 00:15:21,801
and the tides, at least,
have turned somewhat

373
00:15:21,834 --> 00:15:25,734
from where they
began here in Emon.

374
00:15:25,767 --> 00:15:27,968
You also do
notice that the--

375
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,701
the two doors that you
guys originally entered,

376
00:15:29,734 --> 00:15:31,868
that you pushed through?

377
00:15:31,901 --> 00:15:33,868
One of the doors is now
pushed off of its hinges

378
00:15:33,901 --> 00:15:35,067
and has fallen
to the ground.

379
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,701
The other is kind
of partway off that--

380
00:15:36,734 --> 00:15:39,767
that giant gate doorway,
and just beyond it,

381
00:15:39,801 --> 00:15:43,634
you see what looks
to be battle still ensuing.

382
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:48,634
You hear the muffled screams
echoing from outside that gate

383
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:51,300
and streets beyond in Emon
of hundreds of soldiers

384
00:15:51,334 --> 00:15:52,834
shouting into battle.

385
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:57,801
Large heaving war cries
of deep voiced giant-kin.

386
00:15:57,834 --> 00:15:59,767
You see bursts of
flame in the distance

387
00:15:59,801 --> 00:16:00,868
and what looks
to be bodies

388
00:16:00,901 --> 00:16:02,200
occasionally flung
through the air

389
00:16:02,234 --> 00:16:07,033
to disappear past the
horizon beyond the gate top.

390
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:10,067
This-- there is still
warfare raging in this city.

391
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:14,334
LIAM: Can we see through that gate to
where we parted with Kashaw?

392
00:16:14,367 --> 00:16:16,601
MATT: From this distance, you
cannot get that much more.

393
00:16:16,634 --> 00:16:17,834
You can just
see the motion of--

394
00:16:17,868 --> 00:16:19,133
You have to get closer.

395
00:16:19,167 --> 00:16:21,133
LAURA: So, we can't-- can
I reach into my shirt

396
00:16:21,167 --> 00:16:23,701
and grab out that note
that was on the arrow?

397
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:25,334
I never read it.

398
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:27,200
-MATT: Oh, yeah.
-LAURA: What is it?

399
00:16:27,234 --> 00:16:30,067
MATT: It says, My gift to you,
darling, use it well.

400
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,601
LAURA: Oh, I knew it!

401
00:16:32,634 --> 00:16:35,534
We have to find them.

402
00:16:35,567 --> 00:16:37,090
LIAM: Let's go look.

403
00:16:40,234 --> 00:16:43,167
-Just a look.
-LAURA: Just stealth.

404
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,534
To see if it looks
like the giant is gone,

405
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:48,267
and if Zahra and
Kash are around.

406
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,934
LIAM: Why don't we just cover
like half the distance?

407
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:51,167
-See what we can see from there.
-LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

408
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,267
MATT: Okay, stealth
check both you guys.

409
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,834
♪

410
00:16:55,868 --> 00:16:57,000
LIAM: Twenty-eight.

411
00:16:57,033 --> 00:17:00,400
♪

412
00:17:00,434 --> 00:17:03,534
LAURA: Twelve.

413
00:17:03,567 --> 00:17:04,834
-MATT: Wow.
-LAURA: I know.

414
00:17:04,867 --> 00:17:07,165
MATT: Okay.

415
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,400
LAURA: I'm-- you know, I've--
I'm injured grievously.

416
00:17:10,434 --> 00:17:12,501
MATT: You are.

417
00:17:12,534 --> 00:17:14,834
You snatched from the
jaws of death temporarily,

418
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,934
you find yourself
physically affected

419
00:17:17,968 --> 00:17:19,334
more than you
would have expected

420
00:17:19,367 --> 00:17:21,334
and what seemed to you as
just an instant of darkness,

421
00:17:21,367 --> 00:17:23,434
and as you begin to try and
follow after your brother,

422
00:17:23,467 --> 00:17:25,968
you find yourself stumbling
and falling to one knee

423
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,133
and trying
best to keep up.

424
00:17:27,165 --> 00:17:28,267
LAURA: Oh, shit.

425
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,367
MATT: At this time, you
notice two figures

426
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,000
running from the opening in
that gate in your direction.

427
00:17:34,033 --> 00:17:37,267
You see it first, but you
see it for a moment after him.

428
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,834
You see bloodied, bruised,
but still in a full sprint

429
00:17:39,868 --> 00:17:43,434
both Kashaw and Zahra
rushing in your direction

430
00:17:43,467 --> 00:17:47,567
and you hear Kash
just yelling out,

431
00:17:47,601 --> 00:17:49,567
"Vox Machina!

432
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:51,067
You're alive, right?"

433
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,968
LAURA: Keep it down, you fuck!

434
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,267
Come on, come on
into this hole.

435
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,934
MATT: "Hole?"
"Yes, the hole, darling."

436
00:17:58,968 --> 00:17:59,934
"Right."

437
00:17:59,968 --> 00:18:01,200
And they both rush up

438
00:18:01,234 --> 00:18:05,100
and as you guys are
catching up with them,

439
00:18:05,133 --> 00:18:08,667
you notice, by the gate,
pushing through

440
00:18:08,701 --> 00:18:11,434
what looks to be
another fire giant

441
00:18:11,467 --> 00:18:13,300
wielding a sword
kind of dragged behind,

442
00:18:13,334 --> 00:18:16,167
kind of pour through.

443
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,033
(yells)

444
00:18:18,067 --> 00:18:20,200
And just begins
going into a--

445
00:18:20,234 --> 00:18:21,868
a large bounding
sprint in your direction.

446
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:23,734
-LAURA: Oh, God.
-LIAM: Running.

447
00:18:23,767 --> 00:18:25,400
LAURA: Giants, giants at the door.

448
00:18:25,434 --> 00:18:26,834
-Giants!
-TALIESIN: I am moving towards it.

449
00:18:26,868 --> 00:18:28,300
TRAVIS: Yeah, now we're all going
on up towards the hole.

450
00:18:28,334 --> 00:18:30,934
-MATT: Okay.
-LAURA: Can I shoot an arrow at him?

451
00:18:30,968 --> 00:18:33,968
MATT: As you're saying "giants"
into your ear,

452
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,968
you watch as two
crossbow bolts kinda...

453
00:18:39,367 --> 00:18:41,534
into the back of the head
of the giant and giant goes...

454
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:43,667
and stops and looks
over the shoulder

455
00:18:43,701 --> 00:18:47,467
and you see a flash
of light behind him.

456
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:51,267
An impact into the back of the
black ironed giant's armor.

457
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,367
Like a sudden impact of a fiery
meteor just slams into it.

458
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,400
(yells)

459
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:56,567
And the giant
stumbles to one knee

460
00:18:56,601 --> 00:18:58,300
before another blow
hits him right across

461
00:18:58,334 --> 00:18:59,667
the back of the head
and the fire giant

462
00:18:59,701 --> 00:19:03,400
just falls on face first
unconscious onto the ground.

463
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:07,534
Little cloud of dust and dirt
kind of billows up to the sides.

464
00:19:07,567 --> 00:19:10,000
There you see, by
the front of the gate,

465
00:19:10,033 --> 00:19:13,701
you see Jarret with crossbow
right there and standing,

466
00:19:13,734 --> 00:19:16,300
and now stepping up onto the
back of the giant's armor

467
00:19:16,334 --> 00:19:20,234
and slamming a flashing
bright radiant war hammer

468
00:19:20,267 --> 00:19:21,968
into the back of its neck.

469
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,834
You see,
in chain mail,

470
00:19:24,868 --> 00:19:28,133
long beard,
white streaked,

471
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,734
billowing war torn
hair pulled into

472
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:33,067
a tight ponytail
towards the back,

473
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,167
a familiar face.

474
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,968
You see Kerrek,
currently of white--

475
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,300
of Westruun standing,
wipes his brow

476
00:19:41,334 --> 00:19:43,400
and looks up and takes notice
of your presence immediately.

477
00:19:43,434 --> 00:19:45,167
Patrick, if you want
to come on the stage.

478
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,334
LAURA: What the fuck?

479
00:19:46,367 --> 00:19:49,400
(applause, cheers)

480
00:19:49,434 --> 00:19:52,334
SAM: Geez, Louise!
Patrick Rothfuss.

481
00:19:52,367 --> 00:19:57,334
LAURA: Scooch on by since it's
so easy to make your way.

482
00:19:57,367 --> 00:19:58,467
(laughing)

483
00:19:58,501 --> 00:20:01,267
MATT: Our set is so conducive
to movement.

484
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,701
TRAVIS: Oh!

485
00:20:03,734 --> 00:20:04,767
I didn't break it.

486
00:20:04,801 --> 00:20:07,767
-LAURA: The whole set falls down.
-MATT: I know!

487
00:20:07,801 --> 00:20:09,267
LAURA: Kerrek, you can fight!

488
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,467
PATRICK: I get to sit
next to my besty.

489
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:12,000
MARISHA: Yeah!

490
00:20:12,033 --> 00:20:13,761
My new besty.

491
00:20:16,534 --> 00:20:18,267
-LIAM: What in the fuck?
-LAURA: I thought you were--

492
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:22,033
I thought--
you can fight?

493
00:20:22,067 --> 00:20:23,834
PATRICK: Uh.

494
00:20:23,868 --> 00:20:26,968
LAURA: Uh, yeah, you just brought
down a giant, no big deal.

495
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,067
PATRICK: Uh, team effort.

496
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,434
Like is everything cool now?

497
00:20:31,467 --> 00:20:33,000
Like is this
the last of them?

498
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:34,467
MATT: For one, I think you might
want to move a little bit over

499
00:20:34,501 --> 00:20:35,567
to get into the camera.

500
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:37,300
TRAVIS: Yes, come on over.

501
00:20:37,334 --> 00:20:38,434
MATT: Just a smidge
for the audience.

502
00:20:38,467 --> 00:20:40,434
-LAURA: Yeah.
-LIAM: Yeah, yeah.

503
00:20:40,467 --> 00:20:42,267
MATT: There you go,

504
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,501
and as you've been in this
fray for quite some time

505
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:47,467
and the exhaustion's starting
to mount on you a bit,

506
00:20:47,501 --> 00:20:49,434
and the--

507
00:20:49,467 --> 00:20:50,968
the two individuals
that you and your--

508
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,167
your allies have come upon,
being the smaller unit,

509
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,303
you manage to penetrate
further into the city

510
00:20:55,303 --> 00:20:59,200
then the main armies that were
pushing towards the gates.

511
00:20:59,234 --> 00:21:02,801
You saw the
golden-armored human

512
00:21:02,834 --> 00:21:05,534
and the Tiefling
currently struggling with,

513
00:21:05,567 --> 00:21:07,868
what looked to be,
five fire giants.

514
00:21:07,901 --> 00:21:11,734
Three that had come up behind
the two that they had ensnared,

515
00:21:11,767 --> 00:21:14,367
and after minutes of battle

516
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,601
and tearing through them

517
00:21:15,634 --> 00:21:16,968
it looks like you
finally gain the upper hand.

518
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,534
You've lost a number
of allies through this--

519
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:20,100
this incursion, however,

520
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:22,767
these are the really, really
familiar welcome faces

521
00:21:22,801 --> 00:21:26,067
given the perpetual
onslaught that you've seen

522
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,450
since you first
arrived in Emon.

523
00:21:31,033 --> 00:21:34,601
PATRICK: He--he probably just says,

524
00:21:34,634 --> 00:21:36,300
"Is it done?"

525
00:21:36,334 --> 00:21:37,467
LAURA: Is it?

526
00:21:37,501 --> 00:21:39,067
PATRICK: That's his--
that's his opener.

527
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,067
LAURA: I mean, eh.

528
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,100
LIAM: Ish.

529
00:21:43,133 --> 00:21:45,801
LAURA: Thordak was killed.

530
00:21:45,834 --> 00:21:49,300
MATT: Kashaw pipes up and says,
"So you killed the thing?

531
00:21:49,334 --> 00:21:50,868
You killed it,
it's dead, right?"

532
00:21:50,901 --> 00:21:51,968
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

533
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,968
MATT: "Please tell me
you killed the thing."

534
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,968
LAURA: Yes, the thing is dead.

535
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,540
-LIAM: We killed thing.
-LAURA: And gone.

536
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,067
Literally, gone.

537
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,801
-MATT: "Great."
-LAURA: Stolen.

538
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:01,200
MATT: "Fantastic, that's--
that's wonderful, great."

539
00:22:01,234 --> 00:22:03,467
-"We can go home."
-PATRICK: Stolen?

540
00:22:03,501 --> 00:22:05,434
LAURA: Can I hug Zahra?

541
00:22:05,467 --> 00:22:07,701
MATT: Yeah, she-- she
eagerly puts her arms out

542
00:22:07,734 --> 00:22:10,334
and as you guys kind
of embrace real fast,

543
00:22:10,367 --> 00:22:13,467
she kind of-- both of you
almost, from the impact,

544
00:22:13,501 --> 00:22:15,434
stop, the bruising sets in.

545
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:17,467
-MATT: "Darling, careful."
-LAURA: Yeah, yeah, I know, darling.

546
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:18,968
Injured.

547
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,667
PATRICK: How-- how do
these guys look?

548
00:22:21,701 --> 00:22:24,434
MATT: You don't see them yet,
you just see these two.

549
00:22:24,467 --> 00:22:25,968
And after a moment
of these hugs happen,

550
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,567
you kind of
catch your breath.

551
00:22:27,601 --> 00:22:29,434
You notice a few
more figures appear

552
00:22:29,467 --> 00:22:31,467
from out of this large
craterous hole in the ground

553
00:22:31,501 --> 00:22:33,300
in the center of
this ruined district,

554
00:22:33,334 --> 00:22:35,868
and from there you watch
as the familiar Percival,

555
00:22:35,901 --> 00:22:38,434
Scanlan, oh no,
you stay behind?

556
00:22:38,467 --> 00:22:43,033
Grog and Keyleth all
emerge from the hole.

557
00:22:45,601 --> 00:22:47,133
PATRICK: How's she look?

558
00:22:47,167 --> 00:22:48,601
SAM: Whoo!

559
00:22:48,634 --> 00:22:51,067
MATT: A little-- a little
singed, a little burned.

560
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,854
A little worse
for wear, but alive.

561
00:22:53,854 --> 00:22:55,344
Can't say that
much different

562
00:22:55,344 --> 00:22:57,100
from the rest of
her allies as well.

563
00:22:57,133 --> 00:22:58,634
PATRICK: Okay.

564
00:23:03,367 --> 00:23:07,167
I might actually kind of lumber
a little bit in that direction

565
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,601
as if I were going in for a hug,
and then stop when I remember

566
00:23:11,634 --> 00:23:13,400
that maybe I'm not
that sort of person.

567
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:15,367
(laughter)

568
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,467
It looks-- it looks
actually very awkward.

569
00:23:17,501 --> 00:23:20,701
(laughter)

570
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:21,934
TALIESIN: Oh, good.

571
00:23:21,968 --> 00:23:23,734
This is-- this is a face
I would like to see.

572
00:23:23,767 --> 00:23:26,667
MARISHA: Kerr?

573
00:23:26,701 --> 00:23:29,467
LAURA: He just killed
a giant with his

574
00:23:29,501 --> 00:23:32,467
giant hammer of
blazing white--

575
00:23:32,501 --> 00:23:34,934
MARISHA: Keyleth just
closes the distance

576
00:23:34,968 --> 00:23:38,000
and runs up and
just hugs Kerr.

577
00:23:38,033 --> 00:23:41,400
PATRICK: Big bear hug,
big bear hug.

578
00:23:41,434 --> 00:23:44,244
MARISHA: What are you doing here?

579
00:23:45,267 --> 00:23:47,300
PATRICK: Same as everyone.

580
00:23:47,334 --> 00:23:52,167
Been doing-- doing as
much as a person can do.

581
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,167
MARISHA: I got your gift.

582
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,767
PATRICK: I'm so glad of that.

583
00:23:59,801 --> 00:24:02,601
-MARISHA: It meant everything.
-PATRICK: Oh.

584
00:24:02,634 --> 00:24:05,901
MARISHA: Maybe even a little
too literally, like--

585
00:24:05,934 --> 00:24:08,968
like 20 minutes ago.

586
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,133
A lot of passing through
fire here lately.

587
00:24:12,167 --> 00:24:14,434
PATRICK: Yeah.

588
00:24:14,467 --> 00:24:16,634
TALIESIN: To break the
awkward briefly, dear.

589
00:24:16,667 --> 00:24:18,667
TRAVIS: Yeah, much
war still happening.

590
00:24:18,701 --> 00:24:20,968
-LAURA: Maybe we should go down.
-TALIESIN: Wait!

591
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,567
MARISHA: I sky write up in the air,
is there like a--

592
00:24:24,601 --> 00:24:27,100
like a sigil of Emon?

593
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:28,400
Like a--

594
00:24:28,434 --> 00:24:31,200
MATT: I mean, there is a
crest for the city.

595
00:24:31,234 --> 00:24:33,334
You can do a simplified
version of it, if you like.

596
00:24:33,367 --> 00:24:36,267
MARISHA: I do that into the
sky with Sky Write.

597
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,367
MATT: Okay, so the storm,
which is still raging,

598
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,100
but it's moving itself
southwest to almost follow the--

599
00:24:41,133 --> 00:24:44,033
the wyvern riders that have
survived this battle so far

600
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:46,467
and are fleeing
from the scene.

601
00:24:46,501 --> 00:24:49,267
The clouds then begin
to shift and shape

602
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,200
and the darkness separates
into what looks like

603
00:24:51,234 --> 00:24:52,601
little plumes of white

604
00:24:52,634 --> 00:24:56,334
that spell out a very basic
rendition of the symbol of Emon.

605
00:24:56,367 --> 00:24:59,267
♪

606
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,133
What else you wanna do?

607
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:02,234
TRAVIS: Is Kash there?

608
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:03,887
MATT: Kash is there
with you guys.

609
00:25:03,887 --> 00:25:05,901
-TRAVIS: How's he look?
-TALIESIN: Yeah.

610
00:25:05,934 --> 00:25:08,100
MATT: He looks pretty messed up.

611
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:10,234
There are a few large
sections of armor

612
00:25:10,267 --> 00:25:12,200
that have been
just cloven through

613
00:25:12,234 --> 00:25:17,167
and you see a number
of flesh wounds sustained

614
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,200
but nothing mortal, but he--

615
00:25:19,234 --> 00:25:21,501
He holds himself
with a kind of a

616
00:25:21,534 --> 00:25:23,467
knowing confidence
with his arms crossed,

617
00:25:23,501 --> 00:25:24,868
but as soon as any sort
of physical movement,

618
00:25:24,901 --> 00:25:26,467
there is a little
bit of a wheeze

619
00:25:26,501 --> 00:25:28,300
and a trying to cover
for the physical impact

620
00:25:28,334 --> 00:25:29,934
of the battle
he's just sustained.

621
00:25:29,968 --> 00:25:32,841
TRAVIS: You look a little
worse for the wear there.

622
00:25:33,504 --> 00:25:35,434
MATT: "I don't know what
you mean, I'm sorry."

623
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:38,701
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm sorry.
Z, did he go unconscious?

624
00:25:38,734 --> 00:25:40,767
MATT: "Actually, no, he
fought quite bravely."

625
00:25:40,801 --> 00:25:42,634
-TRAVIS: Are you lying?
-MATT: "No."

626
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:44,467
-TRAVIS: Shit.
-MARISHA: She's lying.

627
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:47,968
TRAVIS: Good job,
I guess, Kash.

628
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,534
MATT: He goes, "You didn't
too bad yourself, big man."

629
00:25:50,567 --> 00:25:51,667
Smacks you on the
shoulder and goes...

630
00:25:51,701 --> 00:25:53,434
(whimpering)

631
00:25:53,467 --> 00:25:54,701
TRAVIS: No, that would
never hurt me.

632
00:25:54,734 --> 00:25:56,834
LIAM: I'm gonna walk up
to him as well,

633
00:25:56,868 --> 00:25:58,901
cause he looks
fucked up and say,

634
00:25:58,934 --> 00:26:00,467
"Hey, thank you for
the assist, Spanky."

635
00:26:00,501 --> 00:26:02,534
And I'm gonna give
him two slaps of the cheek

636
00:26:02,567 --> 00:26:04,267
and leave a couple of
black feathers stuck there

637
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:07,300
with sweat and use the last
of my Lay on Hands on him.

638
00:26:07,334 --> 00:26:10,067
TALIESIN: Now that-- now that we've
sent the word, maybe now--

639
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,634
(indistinct talking)

640
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:13,467
The conversation's
underground.

641
00:26:13,501 --> 00:26:14,767
MARISHA: Okay.

642
00:26:14,801 --> 00:26:16,868
LIAM: Everything hurts.

643
00:26:16,901 --> 00:26:19,767
MATT: What's your
armor class?

644
00:26:19,801 --> 00:26:21,801
LIAM: Twenty-one.

645
00:26:21,834 --> 00:26:24,934
MATT: He knees you gently
enough in the nuts

646
00:26:24,968 --> 00:26:26,467
to get you to
drop to one knee.

647
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:27,801
TRAVIS: "Gently enough."

648
00:26:27,834 --> 00:26:29,033
MATT: "That's two."

649
00:26:29,067 --> 00:26:31,534
(laughter)

650
00:26:31,567 --> 00:26:32,567
TRAVIS: Yes, good
throwback!

651
00:26:32,601 --> 00:26:35,501
LIAM: I laugh through it.

652
00:26:35,534 --> 00:26:36,534
TRAVIS: Good callback.

653
00:26:36,567 --> 00:26:37,534
TALIESIN: Are there-- are
there any soldiers

654
00:26:37,567 --> 00:26:38,534
running around
by the way?

655
00:26:38,567 --> 00:26:39,834
Right now, any
of our people?

656
00:26:39,868 --> 00:26:41,334
MATT: Right now, some soldiers
are beginning to pour in

657
00:26:41,367 --> 00:26:43,300
through the gate
that they emerged from.

658
00:26:43,334 --> 00:26:45,314
Some of your allies,
some from other armies

659
00:26:45,314 --> 00:26:46,868
that are starting
to find their way

660
00:26:46,901 --> 00:26:48,750
towards the center
core of the city.

661
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:51,601
Not everyone's been
made aware that the--

662
00:26:51,634 --> 00:26:53,601
the center of this battle

663
00:26:53,634 --> 00:26:57,367
has already been
won, essentially.

664
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,400
TRAVIS: Damn it.

665
00:26:58,434 --> 00:27:00,300
MATT: So, people are
starting to come in

666
00:27:00,334 --> 00:27:01,501
and calm down a bit
and then rush back out

667
00:27:01,534 --> 00:27:02,868
to see what else is there.

668
00:27:02,901 --> 00:27:04,734
You watch as a few wyvern riders
try and scoot through the sky

669
00:27:04,767 --> 00:27:06,961
to catch up with the rest of
them as a bolt of lightning...

670
00:27:06,961 --> 00:27:08,467
Slams into one
and you see it...

671
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:09,501
(yells)

672
00:27:09,534 --> 00:27:11,534
Streak and tumble
and then crash somewhere

673
00:27:11,567 --> 00:27:14,191
on the outside
of the district.

674
00:27:14,191 --> 00:27:16,167
TALIESIN: I'm gonna fire a couple
of times into the air

675
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,834
just to get some
attention and just,

676
00:27:17,868 --> 00:27:20,601
"Spread the word,
Thordak has fallen!

677
00:27:20,634 --> 00:27:21,901
Spread the word!"

678
00:27:21,934 --> 00:27:23,381
Now, we can go down.

679
00:27:23,381 --> 00:27:25,234
MATT: You see some of the
soldiers immediately

680
00:27:25,267 --> 00:27:26,767
kind of look at each other
and you can hear the--

681
00:27:26,801 --> 00:27:28,534
sound of the shouting and
whispering back and forth.

682
00:27:28,567 --> 00:27:32,300
Voices are shouting, "Thordak
has fallen! Thordak has fallen!

683
00:27:32,334 --> 00:27:33,968
Thordak has fallen!"

684
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,834
It starts just carrying
throughout the city and echoing.

685
00:27:36,868 --> 00:27:39,267
MARISHA: Call the locksmith!

686
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,501
MATT: Everyone goes, "What?"

687
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:42,267
"Sorry, Thordak has fallen!"

688
00:27:42,267 --> 00:27:44,137
(laughter)

689
00:27:46,334 --> 00:27:48,960
So, as you--
you follow them

690
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,901
and gather into the
area, or you want to--

691
00:27:50,934 --> 00:27:54,200
PATRICK: I'd say, just as--
and I have to go talk.

692
00:27:54,234 --> 00:27:56,968
I'm like,
"Samantha, it's you.

693
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,367
Circle everyone up.

694
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,400
Make sure the people
are taken care of."

695
00:28:00,434 --> 00:28:02,334
MATT: "Yes."

696
00:28:02,367 --> 00:28:05,300
PATRICK: And it's just
like, 30--

697
00:28:05,334 --> 00:28:07,501
SAM: Another campaign going on.

698
00:28:07,534 --> 00:28:10,901
lots of campaigns have
just briefly touched.

699
00:28:10,934 --> 00:28:13,901
PATRICK: It's a couple--
a couple dozen

700
00:28:13,934 --> 00:28:17,267
moderately well armored,

701
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,400
but you know, like...

702
00:28:20,434 --> 00:28:22,367
These-- these are not
maybe crack troops.

703
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,567
They have a
lot of heart.

704
00:28:24,601 --> 00:28:27,200
LIAM: Do they have
any hit points?

705
00:28:27,234 --> 00:28:30,968
PATRICK: More than you
might expect.

706
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,067
Yeah, and so I just,
I square them away.

707
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,868
They can take care
of themselves by now,

708
00:28:34,901 --> 00:28:36,667
at least for a bit.

709
00:28:36,701 --> 00:28:38,300
MATT: Yeah, they set
up a small perimeter

710
00:28:38,334 --> 00:28:40,367
to the entrance ways
to the district

711
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,868
and are awaiting
other forces to arrive

712
00:28:43,901 --> 00:28:45,267
and inform them
of what's going on

713
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,534
and still stay alert for any
stragglers of the battle.

714
00:28:47,567 --> 00:28:49,491
LIAM: What a world,
what a world.

715
00:28:50,634 --> 00:28:52,701
MATT: As you--
What'd you do?

716
00:28:52,734 --> 00:28:56,267
MARISHA: I just-- I grab Kerr and I start
ushering him down into the hole.

717
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,868
PATRICK: Okay.

718
00:28:57,901 --> 00:29:00,434
MARISHA: Into the hole!

719
00:29:00,467 --> 00:29:01,734
MATT: Laura.

720
00:29:01,767 --> 00:29:03,167
LAURA: I'm so sorry!

721
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,434
MATT: You are-- you're my
favorite 13 year old.

722
00:29:06,467 --> 00:29:08,734
PATRICK: It's-- it's
a lovely hole.

723
00:29:08,767 --> 00:29:11,067
(laughter)

724
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,133
-LIAM: That's what they tell me.
-MATT: There's room for everyone.

725
00:29:13,167 --> 00:29:16,434
PATRICK: It's been a long
time for me, you know.

726
00:29:16,467 --> 00:29:17,901
I haven't done
this recently.

727
00:29:17,934 --> 00:29:20,367
LIAM: I'm in here
all the time.

728
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,234
All the time.

729
00:29:22,267 --> 00:29:25,267
MATT: While this is
happening, Scanlan,

730
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:28,367
you stayed down there
with Kima and Gilmore.

731
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,767
SAM: Yeah, I sort of moseyed my
way back to the beginning--

732
00:29:31,801 --> 00:29:33,601
to the opening
of the lair,

733
00:29:33,634 --> 00:29:35,400
like, where I had
tossed the flute.

734
00:29:35,434 --> 00:29:36,434
MATT: Yeah.

735
00:29:36,467 --> 00:29:37,868
LIAM: And I pick it up,

736
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:40,634
and I carefully divide

737
00:29:40,667 --> 00:29:44,000
my sachet of Suude
into three parts.

738
00:29:44,033 --> 00:29:47,834
Three thirds.

739
00:29:47,868 --> 00:29:51,100
And I'm going to
snort one third of it.

740
00:29:51,133 --> 00:29:53,100
MATT: Okay.

741
00:29:53,133 --> 00:29:55,834
The large brass dragon
that has currently

742
00:29:55,868 --> 00:29:58,434
-been heading at the end--
-SAM: He can watch.

743
00:29:58,467 --> 00:30:00,777
They can watch, they
can watch, they can watch.

744
00:30:00,777 --> 00:30:04,467
MATT: At the end of the
tunnel, Devo'ssa,

745
00:30:04,501 --> 00:30:08,164
they've slowly brought down
to their hands and knees

746
00:30:08,164 --> 00:30:10,033
after travelling through
and scoping out

747
00:30:10,067 --> 00:30:13,534
the interior
of the lair.

748
00:30:13,567 --> 00:30:16,234
Approaches you as you're pulling
out your stash and you know,

749
00:30:16,267 --> 00:30:19,100
Gilmore and Kima
approaching as well.

750
00:30:19,133 --> 00:30:22,133
"What have you there?"

751
00:30:22,167 --> 00:30:24,801
SAM: I've had a...

752
00:30:24,834 --> 00:30:27,767
Not a great
day, Devo'ssa.

753
00:30:29,968 --> 00:30:31,934
Thank you for coming.

754
00:30:31,968 --> 00:30:34,334
For answering our call.

755
00:30:34,367 --> 00:30:37,801
I just need a second to
myself if you don't mind.

756
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,567
LAURA: Isn't Pike
still down there?

757
00:30:41,601 --> 00:30:44,471
MATT: Technically, Pike would
still be down there with him.

758
00:30:45,834 --> 00:30:48,868
SAM: Maybe just
turn a wing?

759
00:30:48,901 --> 00:30:51,334
(laughter)

760
00:30:56,334 --> 00:30:57,701
MATT: They give a
curious glance

761
00:30:57,734 --> 00:31:00,458
as Gilmore
kind of walks up

762
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:01,954
and brushes
his hair back,

763
00:31:01,954 --> 00:31:03,767
which it catches
your eye interestingly.

764
00:31:03,801 --> 00:31:05,804
There is like a glowing
rune of some kind

765
00:31:05,804 --> 00:31:07,701
in the center of
Gilmore's forehead.

766
00:31:07,734 --> 00:31:10,434
He kind of brushes the hair
out of the way and he goes,

767
00:31:10,467 --> 00:31:13,634
"If a man wants some privacy,
give him some privacy.

768
00:31:13,667 --> 00:31:15,434
I just want to ask
you a few questions.

769
00:31:15,467 --> 00:31:19,167
It's not very often
I get to talk to...

770
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,601
J'Mon."

771
00:31:21,834 --> 00:31:26,801
And Gilmore walks up
as the dragon sits back up

772
00:31:26,834 --> 00:31:30,801
and puts out a claw and kind
of lifts Gilmore into his claw.

773
00:31:30,834 --> 00:31:33,200
They both begin having a
conversation back and forth,

774
00:31:33,234 --> 00:31:35,054
which, at this point
Pike is also curious

775
00:31:35,054 --> 00:31:36,400
and begins to
pay attention

776
00:31:36,434 --> 00:31:37,634
and sidles
up next to you

777
00:31:37,667 --> 00:31:39,234
as you begin
divvying out and goes--

778
00:31:39,267 --> 00:31:40,760
SAM: Are they talking
in their language,

779
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,334
the Marquet
language or--

780
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:43,930
MATT: If you want
to listen in--

781
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:46,167
SAM: No, no, I'm just curious.

782
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,834
MATT: Marquesian, and
yes, they are.

783
00:31:48,868 --> 00:31:51,534
-SAM: Exciting.
-TALIESIN: I don't speak that.

784
00:31:51,567 --> 00:31:54,901
MATT: As you begin
taking it out

785
00:31:54,934 --> 00:31:57,467
and you're getting ready to go
ahead and snort one portion.

786
00:31:57,501 --> 00:31:58,601
SAM: One third.

787
00:31:58,634 --> 00:32:01,047
MATT: One third of
your Suude.

788
00:32:01,701 --> 00:32:03,167
Pike approaches
from behind

789
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,868
and claps her gauntlet
onto your shoulder and says,

790
00:32:05,901 --> 00:32:07,834
"Scanlan, you okay?"

791
00:32:07,868 --> 00:32:10,000
SAM: Oh, yeah, I just--

792
00:32:10,033 --> 00:32:14,601
This is some, some
healing herbs that I got.

793
00:32:14,634 --> 00:32:19,000
MATT: "Okay, well, if I--
I'm trained in--

794
00:32:19,033 --> 00:32:22,037
in medicinal applications
if you need my help."

795
00:32:23,701 --> 00:32:25,000
(laughter)

796
00:32:25,033 --> 00:32:26,234
SAM: I put it away.

797
00:32:26,267 --> 00:32:28,901
(laughter)

798
00:32:28,934 --> 00:32:31,064
TRAVIS: Pike cures all.

799
00:32:32,667 --> 00:32:34,988
MATT: She looks over towards Kima

800
00:32:34,988 --> 00:32:37,400
and Kima is now
approaching the rest of you guys

801
00:32:37,434 --> 00:32:39,000
and walking into the lair

802
00:32:39,033 --> 00:32:40,901
and they're feeling
out the vicinity

803
00:32:40,934 --> 00:32:43,901
to see if the lair actions
have come to a halt,

804
00:32:43,934 --> 00:32:46,053
and made it safe.

805
00:32:47,067 --> 00:32:49,133
And so Pike begins
shouting out orders, like,

806
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:50,634
"Alright, we have
to make a perimeter!

807
00:32:50,667 --> 00:32:51,701
Make sure there's
no other exits!

808
00:32:51,734 --> 00:32:52,868
Make sure there's no--

809
00:32:52,901 --> 00:32:56,017
nothing else waiting
for us in this cavern!

810
00:32:56,017 --> 00:32:57,467
I'm giving
orders to a dragon.

811
00:32:57,501 --> 00:32:58,968
You, dragon!

812
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,513
Help us do a
perimeter, please!"

813
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:03,367
And kind of interrupting
the conversation

814
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:07,734
between Devo'ssa
and Gilmore.

815
00:33:07,767 --> 00:33:10,334
The brass dragon
turns the head down.

816
00:33:10,367 --> 00:33:13,601
"Well, if you
insist, small one."

817
00:33:13,634 --> 00:33:15,200
And sets Gilmore back down

818
00:33:15,234 --> 00:33:19,133
onto the center of
the lair floor and...

819
00:33:19,167 --> 00:33:21,367
They just begin
to walk perimeter

820
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,701
as Pike joins up and you are
still left alone in the tunnel,

821
00:33:24,734 --> 00:33:26,000
should you be so inclined.

822
00:33:26,033 --> 00:33:27,827
SAM: Alright, I'll
whip it out again.

823
00:33:27,827 --> 00:33:29,467
(laughter)

824
00:33:29,501 --> 00:33:31,907
MATT: Make an intelligence
check if you don't mind.

825
00:33:31,907 --> 00:33:33,234
Just add your
intelligence.

826
00:33:33,267 --> 00:33:35,501
-SAM: Oh, not good.
-TALIESIN: Wow.

827
00:33:35,534 --> 00:33:37,294
LAURA: You're gonna put
it in your butt.

828
00:33:37,294 --> 00:33:38,400
(laughter)

829
00:33:38,434 --> 00:33:41,334
-SAM: Six!
-MATT: Six!

830
00:33:41,367 --> 00:33:42,954
TRAVIS: Six total?

831
00:33:44,367 --> 00:33:45,934
MATT: Okay.

832
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:48,868
This looks exactly like
the kind of substance

833
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:51,267
you should be
snorting for use.

834
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:55,467
So, you-- you take a bit
of the Suude, and this--

835
00:33:55,501 --> 00:33:59,267
this particular Suude,
taking a closer look at it,

836
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,400
the grains of it,
and it's like--

837
00:34:00,434 --> 00:34:02,033
almost like a--

838
00:34:02,067 --> 00:34:04,300
like a brown sugar
type texture to it.

839
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:06,200
It is a dark
brown color to it.

840
00:34:06,234 --> 00:34:07,901
It looks like a
crystallized dirt almost

841
00:34:07,934 --> 00:34:09,868
and you kind of like take--
take a second, look around.

842
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,833
(sniffs)

843
00:34:11,868 --> 00:34:13,400
It burns!

844
00:34:13,434 --> 00:34:15,567
It burns.

845
00:34:15,601 --> 00:34:17,801
Oh, man,
does it burn!

846
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,701
It burns a lot,
and you're like...

847
00:34:22,734 --> 00:34:24,434
(groaning)

848
00:34:24,467 --> 00:34:26,077
SAM: No effect?

849
00:34:27,601 --> 00:34:29,967
MATT: It burns,
that's an effect.

850
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,467
SAM: Okay.

851
00:34:31,501 --> 00:34:33,601
I take out
the flute.

852
00:34:33,634 --> 00:34:35,427
I pack some in
the front of it.

853
00:34:35,427 --> 00:34:37,177
(laughter)

854
00:34:37,177 --> 00:34:39,067
MATT: This is how you
treat relics

855
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:42,501
that were gifted to you by the
leader of a foreign nation

856
00:34:42,534 --> 00:34:45,567
by turning the expended energy
into a makeshift pipe.

857
00:34:45,601 --> 00:34:47,167
SAM: I'm taking another third

858
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,132
and I'm packing it in
the front of the flute.

859
00:34:49,167 --> 00:34:50,869
TRAVIS: Oh, please let it be--

860
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:52,766
(talking over each other)

861
00:34:52,801 --> 00:34:54,367
Free basing, so!

862
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:58,868
(talking over each other)

863
00:34:58,901 --> 00:35:02,834
SAM: I will dip a torch into
a bit of lava to light it.

864
00:35:02,868 --> 00:35:05,501
(laughter)

865
00:35:05,534 --> 00:35:08,634
And I am going
to bong rip

866
00:35:08,667 --> 00:35:11,701
from this ancient
brass flute.

867
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:13,868
(laughter)

868
00:35:13,901 --> 00:35:16,267
MATT: Alrighty.

869
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,650
I need you to make a
constitution saving throw.

870
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,000
LAURA: What are you doing?!

871
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,100
-SAM: Constitution saving--
-MATT: Constitution saving.

872
00:35:22,133 --> 00:35:25,400
-LAURA: Constitution saving throw!
-MATT: Constitution saving throw.

873
00:35:25,434 --> 00:35:26,467
SAM: Not good.

874
00:35:26,501 --> 00:35:28,467
(laughter)

875
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,868
-Eight.
-MATT: Eight.

876
00:35:30,901 --> 00:35:32,634
Roll 1d4.

877
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:36,133
SAM: Here we go,
here we go.

878
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:38,200
Three.

879
00:35:38,234 --> 00:35:40,167
MATT: As you inhale deeply,

880
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,001
as opposed to the
burning sensation

881
00:35:42,001 --> 00:35:44,334
from when you decided
to snort the granules,

882
00:35:44,367 --> 00:35:47,534
the smoke and
mist that emerges

883
00:35:47,567 --> 00:35:49,868
as it fills your
lungs, actually has a--

884
00:35:49,901 --> 00:35:54,334
a very fine herbal taste
to it almost and it is warm,

885
00:35:54,367 --> 00:35:56,834
and there's a head rush
immediately that hits you.

886
00:35:56,868 --> 00:35:58,634
You feel for a moment your
vision kind of crystallize

887
00:35:58,667 --> 00:36:00,208
and clarify
all of a sudden.

888
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:03,434
All the colors become
briefly brighter

889
00:36:03,467 --> 00:36:07,111
and you feel this
slight pulse of--

890
00:36:07,111 --> 00:36:08,914
of energy whenever
you cast a spell,

891
00:36:08,914 --> 00:36:10,634
like the fingers
kind of warm at the tips

892
00:36:10,667 --> 00:36:12,634
and you
feel the immediate need

893
00:36:12,667 --> 00:36:15,801
to just practice something.

894
00:36:15,834 --> 00:36:19,801
Right before your vision
gets blurry, and dark.

895
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,720
As--

896
00:36:25,334 --> 00:36:28,300
Yeah, that's it,
the rest of you guys--

897
00:36:28,334 --> 00:36:31,834
The rest of you guys come
walking down the tunnel,

898
00:36:31,868 --> 00:36:33,000
being careful,
you know,

899
00:36:33,033 --> 00:36:34,534
weapons out,
but talking,

900
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:37,000
kind of getting up to speed
with what's transpired.

901
00:36:37,033 --> 00:36:39,237
You look in the distance and
you can see within the lair

902
00:36:39,237 --> 00:36:41,434
and you're seeing
this, it's a down--

903
00:36:41,434 --> 00:36:45,100
A decline into this
large heavy tunnel

904
00:36:45,133 --> 00:36:48,167
that is just made
of volcanic rock

905
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,133
and blackened stone with
occasional cracks of--

906
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,167
of melting rock that
are just spilling through

907
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,000
and these small
orange glowing pockets

908
00:36:56,033 --> 00:36:58,100
into this large central
underground cavern

909
00:36:58,133 --> 00:37:01,000
that has an entire
pool of molten rock

910
00:37:01,033 --> 00:37:03,567
that is kind of spiraling
through portions of the floor.

911
00:37:03,601 --> 00:37:05,734
There is a large
brass dragon

912
00:37:05,767 --> 00:37:08,400
just casually strolling
around the opposite side.

913
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:12,167
Huge, gargantuan in
size, strolling around

914
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,434
and a few other
humanoid individuals,

915
00:37:14,467 --> 00:37:19,300
and you guys watch as
a singular male gnome ally

916
00:37:19,334 --> 00:37:22,004
is face down on
the ground not moving.

917
00:37:22,004 --> 00:37:24,217
TRAVIS: Oh, there was
no one even in here!

918
00:37:24,217 --> 00:37:25,667
LAURA: Can I run up to him?

919
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:28,204
-MATT: Yeah.
-LAURA: Scanlan?

920
00:37:29,367 --> 00:37:32,067
Smack him a couple times,
does he wake up?

921
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,601
MATT: Nope.

922
00:37:33,634 --> 00:37:34,667
LAURA: Can I roll him over?

923
00:37:34,701 --> 00:37:36,167
PATRICK: Probably get over
there pretty quick too.

924
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,634
It's not that I don't
think that these guys

925
00:37:37,667 --> 00:37:39,067
can take of their
own wounded, but--

926
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,434
-MATT: Yeah.
-PATRICK: Yeah.

927
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:43,133
MATT: So, you rush up and
have both of you

928
00:37:43,167 --> 00:37:45,434
make a medicine
check right now.

929
00:37:45,467 --> 00:37:48,501
LAURA: Oh my God.

930
00:37:48,534 --> 00:37:49,767
SAM: This is everything.

931
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:51,868
(laughter)

932
00:37:51,901 --> 00:37:53,901
MARISHA: Great time for
a personal crisis.

933
00:37:53,934 --> 00:37:55,634
Great timing!

934
00:37:55,667 --> 00:37:58,901
LIAM: ♪ I'll do anything
for Suude ♪♪

935
00:37:58,934 --> 00:38:01,324
-LAURA: Only eight.
-TALIESIN: That's the end of his turn.

936
00:38:01,324 --> 00:38:02,801
MARISHA: Yes, that was his turn.

937
00:38:02,834 --> 00:38:04,200
-Yeah.
-TALIESIN: Fair.

938
00:38:04,234 --> 00:38:07,567
LAURA: But I've got a Cure Wounds
potion I can--

939
00:38:07,601 --> 00:38:09,300
a Cure Wounds
spell I can use.

940
00:38:09,334 --> 00:38:11,070
MATT: But what'd you roll
your medicine check?

941
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:13,200
-LAURA: Eight.
-MATT: Eight.

942
00:38:13,234 --> 00:38:15,734
PATRICK: Not great, like,
is he gushing blood?

943
00:38:15,767 --> 00:38:18,434
MATT: No, there is no blood
from his wounds.

944
00:38:18,467 --> 00:38:21,734
PATRICK: (sniffing)

945
00:38:21,767 --> 00:38:23,200
Do I know what
that smell is?

946
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:25,467
MATT: What'd you roll for
your medicine check?

947
00:38:25,501 --> 00:38:27,267
PATRICK: Not worth speaking of.
Like 6.

948
00:38:27,267 --> 00:38:28,567
MATT: Okay, okay.

949
00:38:28,601 --> 00:38:30,334
So you're not sure
exactly what happened.

950
00:38:30,367 --> 00:38:33,467
You do smell this
strange kind of herbal,

951
00:38:33,501 --> 00:38:35,754
almost like an
incense scent

952
00:38:35,754 --> 00:38:37,300
that is centered
around his area

953
00:38:37,334 --> 00:38:39,024
and he is breathing.

954
00:38:39,024 --> 00:38:40,387
But he is not conscious.

955
00:38:40,387 --> 00:38:42,234
-LIAM: Pike!
-PATRICK: Can I check for poison?

956
00:38:42,267 --> 00:38:45,767
LAURA: Can I do a nature check to
see if I recognize the scent?

957
00:38:45,767 --> 00:38:47,634
MATT: Sure, make a nature check.

958
00:38:47,667 --> 00:38:49,967
LAURA: I'm gonna cast Cure Wounds
on him, just to try it.

959
00:38:49,967 --> 00:38:52,117
LIAM: And I'm just shouting
out Pike's name.

960
00:38:52,117 --> 00:38:53,968
MARISHA: Ooh, I rolled
a natural 19.

961
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,533
-MATT: Okay.
-MARISHA: So that's 29-- no 30 total.

962
00:38:57,533 --> 00:39:00,597
MATT: Okay, best that you can make,
strangely enough, there's--

963
00:39:00,597 --> 00:39:03,934
the scent is
medicinal almost,

964
00:39:03,968 --> 00:39:06,363
but it's also synthetic
in a way that's not natural.

965
00:39:06,363 --> 00:39:08,300
This-- whatever
this smell is,

966
00:39:08,334 --> 00:39:10,244
it's not a natural incense.

967
00:39:10,244 --> 00:39:11,850
SAM: PCP.

968
00:39:13,334 --> 00:39:14,567
It was laced.

969
00:39:14,601 --> 00:39:17,111
TRAVIS: Anyone check to see if
the pipe's still packed?

970
00:39:17,111 --> 00:39:20,834
MARISHA: Yeah, are there any
signs around Scanlan as--

971
00:39:20,868 --> 00:39:22,200
MATT: Well, yeah, there is--

972
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:26,300
There is
the tarnished brass flute

973
00:39:26,334 --> 00:39:29,434
that was gifted
to him by the leader

974
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:31,400
of the foreign city
of Ank'Harel

975
00:39:31,434 --> 00:39:33,901
that is currently tarnished
by the use of its magic

976
00:39:33,934 --> 00:39:36,701
and it is jammed pack with a
black ashy crystalline substance

977
00:39:36,734 --> 00:39:38,434
with a trail of smoke

978
00:39:38,467 --> 00:39:41,133
that is kind of lazily
drizzling off the tip.

979
00:39:41,167 --> 00:39:43,634
TRAVIS: What did J'Mon do to him?

980
00:39:43,667 --> 00:39:46,200
(laughter)

981
00:39:49,434 --> 00:39:52,601
LAURA: Well, regardless of what's going
on, you healed 13 points.

982
00:39:52,634 --> 00:39:54,244
SAM: Oh, that's nice.

983
00:39:54,244 --> 00:39:57,167
MARISHA: Okay, I pick up the pipe,
since I recognize what--

984
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,534
that's where the
scent is coming from.

985
00:39:59,567 --> 00:40:04,367
Can I like, do an investigation
check or something?

986
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,267
LAURA: Can I smack him across
the face as hard as I can?

987
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,133
-MATT: You can.
-LAURA: Even though I just healed him.

988
00:40:09,167 --> 00:40:10,868
MARISHA: If I can put together
what's going on.

989
00:40:10,901 --> 00:40:13,100
PATRICK: This obviously-- if
he's not gushing blood.

990
00:40:13,133 --> 00:40:14,734
Some sort of
poison going on.

991
00:40:14,767 --> 00:40:15,901
MATT: Okay, so-- so--

992
00:40:15,934 --> 00:40:17,901
SAM: Am I having any sort
of dream, Matt?

993
00:40:17,934 --> 00:40:20,868
MATT: No, darkness.

994
00:40:20,901 --> 00:40:22,400
TRAVIS: Darkness.

995
00:40:22,434 --> 00:40:24,501
MATT: You utilize Detect Poison
and you don't--

996
00:40:24,534 --> 00:40:28,234
you don't sense anything
that is clarified toxin

997
00:40:28,267 --> 00:40:30,801
to the point where it would
register as a poison,

998
00:40:30,834 --> 00:40:32,367
so at least,
you're calm--

999
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,868
you're calmed
to know that

1000
00:40:33,901 --> 00:40:35,968
there isn't something coursing
through his system right now

1001
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,267
that is in danger
of killing him.

1002
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,400
-PATRICK: Okay.
-MARISHA: Fifteen.

1003
00:40:39,434 --> 00:40:41,767
-MATT: Fifteen on investigation?
-MARISHA: Yeah.

1004
00:40:41,801 --> 00:40:43,767
MATT: Yeah, he smoked
something out of this.

1005
00:40:43,801 --> 00:40:46,847
(laughter)

1006
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,167
MARISHA: Guys.

1007
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,423
I feel like this was
a classic Scanlan.

1008
00:40:56,067 --> 00:40:59,033
In terms of choices, I don't
think anyone did this.

1009
00:40:59,067 --> 00:41:01,300
LAURA: I don't understand.

1010
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:04,200
MARISHA: I'm gonna start kind
of, like, like kinda,

1011
00:41:04,234 --> 00:41:07,334
can I start seeing if I can find
whatever he put in this pipe?

1012
00:41:07,367 --> 00:41:08,567
MATT: Make an investigation check

1013
00:41:08,601 --> 00:41:11,534
as you start rummaging
through his stuff.

1014
00:41:11,567 --> 00:41:12,801
MARISHA: Eleven.

1015
00:41:12,834 --> 00:41:14,534
MATT: Alright, you're pulling
through pockets.

1016
00:41:14,567 --> 00:41:16,801
He has a lot more pockets
than you'd expect.

1017
00:41:16,834 --> 00:41:18,200
LAURA: Can I do investigation check?

1018
00:41:18,234 --> 00:41:21,067
Cause I'm good at hiding
things on my person.

1019
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,634
MARISHA: Hey, Vex--
Vex, look.

1020
00:41:23,667 --> 00:41:25,334
I-- I think he
did something.

1021
00:41:25,367 --> 00:41:27,334
I think he--
he tried something.

1022
00:41:27,367 --> 00:41:29,133
Look and see if you
can find what might be--

1023
00:41:29,167 --> 00:41:30,934
what he might have
put in this pipe.

1024
00:41:30,968 --> 00:41:33,024
MATT: So they're starting to go
the rest of his pockets.

1025
00:41:33,024 --> 00:41:34,567
Make an investigation check.

1026
00:41:34,601 --> 00:41:37,187
What'd you get here, Vex?

1027
00:41:37,801 --> 00:41:40,901
LAURA: Goddammit, I'm
rolling like shit!

1028
00:41:41,934 --> 00:41:43,367
Ten.

1029
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,121
MATT: Okay, you both
start pulling

1030
00:41:45,121 --> 00:41:47,367
through the pockets
before Scanlan--

1031
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,667
SAM: I have a porn book
that they might find.

1032
00:41:50,701 --> 00:41:54,000
MATT: And you do, you find a fantastic
small pocket sized tome

1033
00:41:54,033 --> 00:41:57,367
that manages to contain
a lot of very, very detailed

1034
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,734
pieces of artwork about
male and female anatomy.

1035
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,834
TRAVIS: I'll take that.

1036
00:42:01,868 --> 00:42:04,267
MARISHA: I take the pipe.

1037
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:07,200
Sorry, the flute.

1038
00:42:07,234 --> 00:42:10,501
MATT: You also, you watch
as Scanlan begins to shift

1039
00:42:10,534 --> 00:42:12,467
and his eyes begin to
flutter open and you--

1040
00:42:12,501 --> 00:42:15,167
you come back to consciousness
with a mild headache

1041
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,200
with all of your
friends gathered around

1042
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:19,868
and Keyleth and Vax with
their hands in your pockets.

1043
00:42:19,901 --> 00:42:21,067
LAURA: I'm Vex, hi.

1044
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,133
-MATT: Vex.
-LAURA: Hi.

1045
00:42:22,167 --> 00:42:24,000
SAM: Get your hands
out of my pockets.

1046
00:42:24,033 --> 00:42:26,067
LAURA: What the fuck
did you do?

1047
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,761
SAM: Wait, first.

1048
00:42:28,534 --> 00:42:29,667
Are you real?

1049
00:42:29,701 --> 00:42:31,367
(laughter)

1050
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,001
TALIESIN: No.

1051
00:42:33,734 --> 00:42:35,033
SAM: Is this a hallucination?

1052
00:42:35,067 --> 00:42:36,534
-TRAVIS: Yep.
-TALIESIN: Yes.

1053
00:42:36,567 --> 00:42:38,133
MARISHA: Scanlan, why
would you be asking

1054
00:42:38,167 --> 00:42:39,901
if this is a
hallucination?

1055
00:42:39,934 --> 00:42:41,033
Just curious.

1056
00:42:41,067 --> 00:42:42,980
SAM: We've had a
very rough day.

1057
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:45,234
How do I feel, Matt?

1058
00:42:45,267 --> 00:42:48,204
MATT: I mean, you feel
like there was--

1059
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,634
there was something
to the rush,

1060
00:42:51,667 --> 00:42:53,267
but your body
rejected it.

1061
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,634
SAM: Rejected it.

1062
00:42:55,667 --> 00:42:57,434
-Hmm, interesting.
-MARISHA: Huh.

1063
00:42:57,467 --> 00:42:58,567
TRAVIS: Are you tired?

1064
00:42:58,601 --> 00:43:00,501
You were asleep
when we found you.

1065
00:43:00,534 --> 00:43:03,067
LAURA: Face down.

1066
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:06,033
SAM: I was shaken
by today's events

1067
00:43:06,067 --> 00:43:08,300
and there was a lair action
that knocked me unconscious.

1068
00:43:08,334 --> 00:43:10,467
-TRAVIS: Holy shit.
-LAURA: What's a lair action?

1069
00:43:10,501 --> 00:43:15,000
SAM: I mean, there was
a trap set by Thordak

1070
00:43:15,033 --> 00:43:18,534
previously to his death that
knocked me unconscious?

1071
00:43:18,567 --> 00:43:20,634
LAURA: What's in this flute,
you piece of shit?

1072
00:43:20,667 --> 00:43:21,901
What's in the flute?

1073
00:43:21,934 --> 00:43:23,434
SAM: Herbs, give it to me!

1074
00:43:23,467 --> 00:43:25,634
MARISHA: No, no, no.

1075
00:43:25,667 --> 00:43:28,501
LAURA: No, you're too short,
you can't even reach.

1076
00:43:28,534 --> 00:43:29,640
MARISHA: I'm too--

1077
00:43:31,434 --> 00:43:32,567
TALIESIN: Angry T-Rex.

1078
00:43:32,601 --> 00:43:34,594
MARISHA: Can I do an
insight check on him?

1079
00:43:34,594 --> 00:43:35,934
MATT: Sure.

1080
00:43:35,968 --> 00:43:38,367
Scanlan, make a
deception check.

1081
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,400
SAM: Thirty-two.

1082
00:43:39,434 --> 00:43:43,100
(laughter)

1083
00:43:43,133 --> 00:43:44,100
MATT: What'd you get,
Keyleth?

1084
00:43:44,133 --> 00:43:45,901
MARISHA: Twenty-two.

1085
00:43:45,934 --> 00:43:49,367
MATT: Legitimately, like, aw,
I guess a misunderstanding.

1086
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,767
SAM: I'm shaken,
guys, I'm sorry.

1087
00:43:52,801 --> 00:43:54,267
I'm-- I'm not myself.

1088
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:55,801
TRAVIS: Was it like poison gas

1089
00:43:55,834 --> 00:43:58,334
or like lava or did a
rock fall on your head?

1090
00:43:58,367 --> 00:44:00,968

00:57:01,467 --> 00:57:05,000
showing the lift off
as you can only ascertain

1400
00:57:05,033 --> 00:57:08,033
J'Mon Sa Ord,
leader of Ank'Harel,

1401
00:57:08,067 --> 00:57:12,067
the brass dragon begins flight
back towards their home.

1402
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:15,434
LAURA: Oh, shit, did J'Mon
fly here that entire way?

1403
00:57:15,467 --> 00:57:18,934
SAM: No, I don't
I don't think so.

1404
00:57:18,968 --> 00:57:20,400
TRAVIS: Flash.

1405
00:57:20,434 --> 00:57:21,400
SAM: Maybe.

1406
00:57:21,434 --> 00:57:24,634
LAURA: I was joking,
I was joking.

1407
00:57:24,667 --> 00:57:27,334
SAM: As terrible as
this day has been,

1408
00:57:27,367 --> 00:57:30,367
there is some gold at
the end of the tunnel.

1409
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:34,534
TRAVIS: Which is probably
rigged to explode.

1410
00:57:34,567 --> 00:57:37,634
TALIESIN: I think it's
probably-- well--

1411
00:57:37,667 --> 00:57:38,801
SAM: Want to go
check it out?

1412
00:57:38,834 --> 00:57:40,868
LAURA: Kind of feel like,
we should, you know--

1413
00:57:40,901 --> 00:57:42,367
Heal up a bit.

1414
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,901
I've been here before.

1415
00:57:43,934 --> 00:57:47,901
It didn't go so well.

1416
00:57:47,934 --> 00:57:49,868
PATRICK: Yeah, how knocked
about are they?

1417
00:57:49,901 --> 00:57:52,501
I mean, obviously, singes
and abrasions and--

1418
00:57:52,534 --> 00:57:54,701
LAURA: Like really, really
knocked to shit.

1419
00:57:54,734 --> 00:57:57,601
TRAVIS: Raise your hand if you have
less than 30 hit points.

1420
00:57:57,634 --> 00:57:59,200
MARISHA: I'm at 30.

1421
00:57:59,234 --> 00:58:01,267
PATRICK: I could probably take
out the whole group.

1422
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:06,200
(laughter)

1423
00:58:06,234 --> 00:58:09,868
-TALIESIN: Wow, that would be--
-MATT: Plot twist!

1424
00:58:09,901 --> 00:58:11,501
LAURA: Oh my God,
are you Raishan?

1425
00:58:11,534 --> 00:58:15,033
LIAM: Rothfuss!

1426
00:58:15,067 --> 00:58:19,734
PATRICK: I was sent here
by Acquisitions.

1427
00:58:19,767 --> 00:58:21,434
MATT: Assassination mission.

1428
00:58:21,467 --> 00:58:23,504
-I love it.
-PATRICK: You sons of bitches.

1429
00:58:23,504 --> 00:58:24,901
(laughter)

1430
00:58:24,934 --> 00:58:26,067
SAM: You befriended us!

1431
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:30,033
PATRICK: Next time you pay
your protection money.

1432
00:58:30,067 --> 00:58:32,601
SAM: Just like us to do this,
we trust everybody!

1433
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:35,367
God, we're idiots!

1434
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,567
LAURA: Oh, shit.

1435
00:58:36,601 --> 00:58:38,481
MATT: The last thing you
hear is the laughter

1436
00:58:38,481 --> 00:58:41,200
of a one-armed man in
the distance echoing.

1437
00:58:41,234 --> 00:58:43,534
LIAM: Clarota, Asum, Rothfuss.

1438
00:58:43,567 --> 00:58:45,400
Never ends!

1439
00:58:45,434 --> 00:58:47,300
PATRICK: But no, if
people are that--

1440
00:58:47,334 --> 00:58:51,901
are that bad,
like, I'll--

1441
00:58:51,934 --> 00:58:54,167
You know.

1442
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:55,400
How are you?

1443
00:58:55,434 --> 00:58:57,467
You're obviously, like,
it's gonna be, like,

1444
00:58:57,501 --> 00:58:59,701
are you like visibly
like knocked about?

1445
00:58:59,734 --> 00:59:02,300
-LAURA: I mean she's--
-MARISHA: I kinda fell in a pit of lava.

1446
00:59:02,334 --> 00:59:04,400
LAURA: She's basically black
cinder right now.

1447
00:59:04,434 --> 00:59:06,167
PATRICK: Oh, really?

1448
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:07,934
-Okay.
-LAURA: She face planted into lava.

1449
00:59:07,968 --> 00:59:09,767
LIAM: She's burned,
she's burned.

1450
00:59:09,801 --> 00:59:13,300
PATRICK: I'm like, Do you really want to
go looking for gold right now?

1451
00:59:13,334 --> 00:59:15,033
Because you--

1452
00:59:15,067 --> 00:59:18,701
♪

1453
00:59:18,734 --> 00:59:20,033
Would you like to come
over here and sit down?

1454
00:59:20,067 --> 00:59:21,434
I can take a look at--

1455
00:59:21,467 --> 00:59:23,467
TRAVIS: As they discuss, can I
just walk over to a pile of--

1456
00:59:23,501 --> 00:59:25,367
LAURA: Kash, how low are
you on healing?

1457
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,701
Can you heal us?

1458
00:59:27,734 --> 00:59:30,100
MATT: Kash and Zahra, who
just kind of sitting off

1459
00:59:30,133 --> 00:59:33,033
of the edge of the cavern,
kind of taking a breather.

1460
00:59:33,067 --> 00:59:37,300
"Um, well, I got a
little bit, I guess."

1461
00:59:37,334 --> 00:59:40,534
Zahra, by the way,
is like healed to full.

1462
00:59:40,567 --> 00:59:43,667
TRAVIS: Of course.

1463
00:59:43,701 --> 00:59:45,501
MARISHA: Yeah, I just--

1464
00:59:49,167 --> 00:59:52,100
Keyleth just
bursts into tears.

1465
00:59:52,133 --> 00:59:54,133
She just start--

1466
00:59:54,167 --> 00:59:56,734
I'm so tired!

1467
00:59:56,767 --> 00:59:59,167
I'm so tired.

1468
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,367
PATRICK: I'll kinda just kinda
usher her off a little bit

1469
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:07,300
wherever, like, is a little less
in the middle of everything.

1470
01:00:07,334 --> 01:00:08,868
And I've got
my little pack

1471
01:00:08,901 --> 01:00:10,400
and we can lay
it on the blanket.

1472
01:00:10,434 --> 01:00:13,300
And she needs to get
some of these charred,

1473
01:00:13,334 --> 01:00:15,601
smoldering clothes off of her.

1474
01:00:15,634 --> 01:00:17,300
And so I can
look at these burns

1475
01:00:17,334 --> 01:00:21,133
and start, um, you know...

1476
01:00:21,167 --> 01:00:23,033
LAURA: I nudge Vax.

1477
01:00:23,067 --> 01:00:28,434
I think that guy's puttin'
moves on your woman.

1478
01:00:28,467 --> 01:00:32,367
-Okay.
-TRAVIS: Super worried.

1479
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,441
MARISHA: I do the same to Kerr,

1480
01:00:34,441 --> 01:00:37,801
I just...my eyes.

1481
01:00:37,834 --> 01:00:40,501
MATT: Kash kind of walks up and
slaps you on your shoulder,

1482
01:00:40,534 --> 01:00:45,968
Vex, and kind of a jolt
and you heal 14 points.

1483
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,868
Cure wounds a little too,

1484
01:00:47,901 --> 01:00:51,334
but as a bit of a
jolt through your body.

1485
01:00:51,367 --> 01:00:53,601
LAURA: It's good, it's good.

1486
01:00:53,634 --> 01:00:56,300
-Thank you.
-MATT: "You're welcome."

1487
01:00:56,334 --> 01:00:59,167
He turns back around and
walks back to Zahra.

1488
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,501
PATRICK: And I just kind of
do the slow talk.

1489
01:01:01,534 --> 01:01:03,067
You know, we're kind of like,

1490
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:04,868
it's like, oh,
this isn't as bad

1491
01:01:04,901 --> 01:01:06,534
as it looks
at first, you know.

1492
01:01:06,567 --> 01:01:08,300
And, 'cause this
was the old thing

1493
01:01:08,334 --> 01:01:10,234
that I did in town for years.

1494
01:01:10,267 --> 01:01:12,200
Somebody would come to
me hurt and I'd be like,

1495
01:01:12,234 --> 01:01:16,734
oh, it's like--nobody
knew who I was in town

1496
01:01:16,767 --> 01:01:18,167
for 20 years.

1497
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:24,400
So I do the gentlest, least
obtrusive laying on of hands.

1498
01:01:24,434 --> 01:01:26,234
You know, where it's like,
oh, you know,

1499
01:01:26,267 --> 01:01:28,467
this probably stung
like the dickens,

1500
01:01:28,501 --> 01:01:30,000
but, you know--

1501
01:01:30,033 --> 01:01:31,067
Look at this,
look at this,

1502
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:32,901
it's just rubbing,
this is just--

1503
01:01:32,934 --> 01:01:35,167
TRAVIS: Oh, you skinned your knees,
let me blow on that.

1504
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:36,801
(cross talk)

1505
01:01:36,834 --> 01:01:37,901
LAURA: And I'm hugging you.

1506
01:01:37,934 --> 01:01:39,133
MARISHA: Why am I so cold?

1507
01:01:39,167 --> 01:01:42,067
LAURA: I heal Vax 12 points
while I'm hugging him.

1508
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:44,300
SAM: I take a little potion.

1509
01:01:44,334 --> 01:01:45,934
TALIESIN: Try and clear
my guns in the hopes

1510
01:01:45,968 --> 01:01:48,501
that they're
actually gonna work.

1511
01:01:48,534 --> 01:01:50,033
So proficiency?

1512
01:01:50,067 --> 01:01:53,267
PATRICK: Uh, so down, like you can soak
up another 30, I'm assuming?

1513
01:01:53,300 --> 01:02:00,100
MARISHA: Yeah, I have 118 max, so.

1514
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:03,834
PATRICK: Then, yeah,
soak up a full 35.

1515
01:02:03,868 --> 01:02:05,434
TALIESIN: Whoa, there you go.

1516
01:02:05,467 --> 01:02:06,701
Are we calling
this a short rest?

1517
01:02:06,734 --> 01:02:09,400
Is that what's
happening right now?

1518
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:12,100
Are we having, like, some sort
of spontaneous short rest?

1519
01:02:12,133 --> 01:02:14,057
MATT: If you would like
to take a short rest--

1520
01:02:14,057 --> 01:02:16,400
TALIESIN: Oh, my God.

1521
01:02:16,434 --> 01:02:18,100
LIAM: I got 16 hit dice, man.

1522
01:02:18,133 --> 01:02:21,267
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm gonna burn
a few hit dice as well.

1523
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:23,627
TRAVIS: So there is a full blown war
happening up on--

1524
01:02:23,627 --> 01:02:25,434
SAM: Oh, shit, that's true.

1525
01:02:25,467 --> 01:02:27,167
TALIESIN: Yeah, you know,
we just fought two dragons,

1526
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,934
they can handle this.

1527
01:02:29,968 --> 01:02:31,701
MATT: Okay, so you're all
taking a short rest before

1528
01:02:31,734 --> 01:02:33,200
or your going to
the gold and not taking--

1529
01:02:33,234 --> 01:02:35,267
-TRAVIS: Gold.
-MATT: Okay.

1530
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:36,634
So as you all take a moment--

1531
01:02:36,667 --> 01:02:38,198
TRAVIS: There's a lot
of talking happening,

1532
01:02:38,198 --> 01:02:39,667
I just wandered off.

1533
01:02:39,701 --> 01:02:41,567
MATT: So as you guys begin
to take the rests,

1534
01:02:41,601 --> 01:02:44,234
tend to your wounds,
take a breather,

1535
01:02:44,267 --> 01:02:45,734
and begin to mentally
prepare yourself

1536
01:02:45,767 --> 01:02:47,834
for whatever the next stage
of your journey is.

1537
01:02:47,868 --> 01:02:49,334
Grog, you step out
into the cavern,

1538
01:02:49,367 --> 01:02:51,234
now without the
red in your eyes

1539
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:53,601
that normally calls to
combat where your focus is on

1540
01:02:53,634 --> 01:02:55,901
what you can hurt and
kill as soon as possible.

1541
01:02:55,934 --> 01:02:58,501
Now it's what can loot and
keep as soon as possible.

1542
01:02:58,534 --> 01:03:01,200
And make an
investigation check.

1543
01:03:01,234 --> 01:03:04,100
TRAVIS: Okay, gonna be high.

1544
01:03:04,133 --> 01:03:07,467
Oh, 17 plus, minus 2.

1545
01:03:07,501 --> 01:03:08,901
-Fifteen.
-MATT: Fifteen.

1546
01:03:08,934 --> 01:03:13,400
Uh, doesn't matter too much

1547
01:03:13,434 --> 01:03:15,334
as you walk in and begin
taking in the surroundings,

1548
01:03:15,367 --> 01:03:17,501
you can see there
are edges of the cavern

1549
01:03:17,534 --> 01:03:22,601
that are just crammed
with gold and platinum

1550
01:03:22,634 --> 01:03:29,100
and art fixtures and vases,
and golden, brass, and silver

1551
01:03:29,133 --> 01:03:31,601
keepsakes and knick-knacks
and decorations.

1552
01:03:31,634 --> 01:03:33,634
You can see chains
and candelabras

1553
01:03:33,667 --> 01:03:35,334
You can see all sorts--

1554
01:03:35,367 --> 01:03:38,334
it looks like
and you kind of--

1555
01:03:38,367 --> 01:03:41,188
some of you gleaned this
as you went in here.

1556
01:03:41,188 --> 01:03:43,033
This is more wealth
than you've ever seen

1557
01:03:43,067 --> 01:03:44,167
in your entire life.

1558
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:49,033
This...this is probably
a majority of the wealth

1559
01:03:49,067 --> 01:03:52,534
of Emon that has been slowly
brought to Thordak

1560
01:03:52,567 --> 01:03:57,267
and forced into his lair
as part of the tyranny

1561
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:01,033
that he took over the city.

1562
01:04:01,067 --> 01:04:03,801
So, all the money
here has been amassed

1563
01:04:03,834 --> 01:04:06,734
from the guilds,
from the villagers,

1564
01:04:06,767 --> 01:04:10,100
from the townsfolk,
from the temples,

1565
01:04:10,133 --> 01:04:14,667
from the shops,
from the Cloudtop.

1566
01:04:14,701 --> 01:04:17,734
This is the economy of Emon

1567
01:04:17,767 --> 01:04:20,100
crammed into, at least
a majority of it,

1568
01:04:20,133 --> 01:04:21,868
into a singular cavern.

1569
01:04:21,901 --> 01:04:26,334
TRAVIS: I feel overwhelmed by
the sheer amount of stuff.

1570
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:30,100
Are there any, like,
unique looking knick-knacks

1571
01:04:30,133 --> 01:04:33,701
or really lovely or
dangerous looking weapons

1572
01:04:33,734 --> 01:04:35,033
that grab my eye?

1573
01:04:35,067 --> 01:04:36,534
Because it's just
a lot of shit.

1574
01:04:36,567 --> 01:04:39,000
MATT: Well, as based on your
investigation check,

1575
01:04:39,033 --> 01:04:44,734
which is a 15, um, you do
find a couple of fun things.

1576
01:04:44,767 --> 01:04:47,324
You find a...

1577
01:04:48,068 --> 01:04:49,868
TRAVIS: I love it when he
reaches for stuff.

1578
01:04:49,901 --> 01:04:51,133
LAURA: I know.

1579
01:04:51,167 --> 01:04:55,167
MATT: You find a somewhat familiar
looking metallic rod

1580
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:58,067
about that long, cylindrical.

1581
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:02,567
Looks to have a couple of small,
almost ring divots on it.

1582
01:05:02,601 --> 01:05:04,100
You're pretty
sure you have one of these.

1583
01:05:04,133 --> 01:05:05,367
LAURA: Immovable rod.

1584
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:06,534
TRAVIS: What?

1585
01:05:06,567 --> 01:05:07,667
SAM: Immovable rod.

1586
01:05:07,701 --> 01:05:09,567
-TRAVIS: Yeah.
-SAM: Who has ours?

1587
01:05:09,601 --> 01:05:12,067
-LAURA: I think I have it.
-MATT: You've seen it?

1588
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:14,501
SAM: Why don't we use that more?

1589
01:05:14,534 --> 01:05:18,467
TRAVIS: Oh, no, no, it's
not the same thing.

1590
01:05:18,501 --> 01:05:19,434
LAURA: Ooh.

1591
01:05:19,467 --> 01:05:21,367
MARISHA: Oh, yeah,
you'd be like climbing.

1592
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:24,300
TRAVIS: This is different,
this is a movable rod.

1593
01:05:24,334 --> 01:05:27,047
SAM: Oh, it's a movable one,
not an immovable one?

1594
01:05:27,047 --> 01:05:28,968
PATRICK: Just, which means
it's just a rod.

1595
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,667
MATT: It's just a rod, basically.

1596
01:05:30,701 --> 01:05:33,157
TALIESIN: It's a shake weight,
it's a shake weight,

1597
01:05:33,167 --> 01:05:35,567
(laughing)

1598
01:05:35,601 --> 01:05:37,434
It can't stop moving.

1599
01:05:37,467 --> 01:05:40,133
LIAM: You sullied
Dungeons and Dragons.

1600
01:05:40,167 --> 01:05:41,334
TALIESIN: I would hope so.

1601
01:05:41,367 --> 01:05:44,601
MATT: Mind you, that fighter's
forearms look amazing.

1602
01:05:44,634 --> 01:05:47,667
So you pick that up
and you start glancing through

1603
01:05:47,701 --> 01:05:49,000
and you're just kind
of pushing through

1604
01:05:49,033 --> 01:05:50,534
some of the art objects--

1605
01:05:50,567 --> 01:05:52,767
a large painting that
just breaks in half.

1606
01:05:52,801 --> 01:05:54,968
TRAVIS: If there's a vase I
would totally smash that.

1607
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,667
MATT: You smash a
few vases, actually.

1608
01:05:56,701 --> 01:05:58,901
TALIESIN: Ironically, there are
two gold coins inside.

1609
01:05:58,934 --> 01:06:02,567
(laughing)

1610
01:06:02,601 --> 01:06:05,234
MATT: Um, you also do
see to the side

1611
01:06:05,267 --> 01:06:09,300
a...what looks to be a
wooden box about that big

1612
01:06:09,334 --> 01:06:10,434
that is latched shut.

1613
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:14,334
It has beautiful
engraving all across it.

1614
01:06:14,367 --> 01:06:16,400
And what looks to
be almost like gold leaf

1615
01:06:16,434 --> 01:06:19,167
with little gems
of blue and red

1616
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:20,534
kind of toward the corners.

1617
01:06:20,567 --> 01:06:24,868
It's a really beautiful artisan
wooden box about that big.

1618
01:06:24,901 --> 01:06:29,868
And then there is a large, looks
like a beautiful tapestry

1619
01:06:29,901 --> 01:06:31,334
that is rolled up and bound.

1620
01:06:31,367 --> 01:06:32,767
TRAVIS: Okay, that's boring.

1621
01:06:32,801 --> 01:06:35,901
The box, like does it look
like it's simple to open?

1622
01:06:35,934 --> 01:06:38,434
MATT: Uh, you pick
it up and look at it.

1623
01:06:38,467 --> 01:06:40,667
It has a little latch on it.

1624
01:06:40,701 --> 01:06:42,367
-TRAVIS: What would--
-MATT: Make an intelligence check.

1625
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:45,801
TRAVIS: What would that guy that's
always sneaking around do?

1626
01:06:45,834 --> 01:06:50,100
Intelligence check
two minus--yeah two, okay.

1627
01:06:50,133 --> 01:06:54,167
-So, zero.
-MATT: Zero.

1628
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:57,234
You shake it, there's something
inside it, rattles around.

1629
01:06:57,267 --> 01:06:58,200
It's got a little heft to it.

1630
01:06:58,234 --> 01:06:59,367
TALIESIN: Oh, boy.

1631
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,400
MATT: You look at it, try
and pry open the side.

1632
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:02,434
Nothing.

1633
01:07:02,467 --> 01:07:03,901
TRAVIS: Even with the
titanstone knuckles,

1634
01:07:03,934 --> 01:07:04,901
it doesn't open?

1635
01:07:04,934 --> 01:07:05,868
MATT: You want to
use your strength?

1636
01:07:05,901 --> 01:07:07,027
Go and roll
a strength check.

1637
01:07:07,027 --> 01:07:08,434
-TRAVIS: Yeah.
-MATT: Force it open.

1638
01:07:08,467 --> 01:07:10,200
LIAM: You're going to break
a wonderful item.

1639
01:07:10,234 --> 01:07:12,334
TRAVIS: Dammit.

1640
01:07:12,367 --> 01:07:13,467
Eleven.

1641
01:07:13,501 --> 01:07:14,534
MATT: Eleven, okay.

1642
01:07:14,567 --> 01:07:16,634
TRAVIS: That was a low roll.

1643
01:07:16,667 --> 01:07:22,767
MATT: Uh, you crssshh and the wooden
case just breaks in half.

1644
01:07:22,801 --> 01:07:24,100
And as it does,
you see what looks to be

1645
01:07:24,133 --> 01:07:26,501
a small leather sleeve,

1646
01:07:26,534 --> 01:07:30,234
similar shape kind
of pfff and land.

1647
01:07:30,267 --> 01:07:31,267
-TRAVIS: I'll go get it.
-MATT: Pick it up.

1648
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:32,467
And it's a leather pouch,

1649
01:07:32,501 --> 01:07:34,667
it has a little top,
it's buttoned shut.

1650
01:07:34,701 --> 01:07:36,100
And it looks like there's
something inside,

1651
01:07:36,133 --> 01:07:37,200
almost like cards.

1652
01:07:37,234 --> 01:07:40,434
MARISHA: No, no.

1653
01:07:40,467 --> 01:07:43,567
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, open the sleeve,
the leather sleeve.

1654
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:44,434
PATRICK: No.

1655
01:07:44,467 --> 01:07:46,300
MATT: What are you gonna pull out?

1656
01:07:46,334 --> 01:07:48,067
MARISHA: You wish.

1657
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:49,434
MATT: You open it
and you can see inside

1658
01:07:49,467 --> 01:07:52,167
what looks to
be about 13 cards,

1659
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:53,701
tarot looking cards.

1660
01:07:53,734 --> 01:07:55,868
-TRAVIS: Little cards.
-MATT: Cards, yeah.

1661
01:07:55,901 --> 01:07:57,701
TRAVIS: Do they smell
like anything?

1662
01:07:57,734 --> 01:08:00,801
MATT: Uh, they smell
clean and fresh.

1663
01:08:00,834 --> 01:08:04,367
TRAVIS: How far away is the lava?

1664
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:07,200
MATT: Um, maybe from where you are
right now in this portion,

1665
01:08:07,234 --> 01:08:09,167
I'd say 25 feet.

1666
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,400
-TRAVIS: Who the hell uses--
-LAURA: No, Travis!

1667
01:08:11,434 --> 01:08:14,634
(laughing)

1668
01:08:14,667 --> 01:08:17,000
-TRAVIS: What?
-LAURA: What are you even doing?

1669
01:08:17,033 --> 01:08:18,234
TRAVIS: I'm going through the loot,

1670
01:08:18,267 --> 01:08:19,968
you all are fucking
healing and shit,

1671
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,701
I'm trying to find
something useful here.

1672
01:08:21,734 --> 01:08:23,133
TALIESIN: Did you find
anything useful?

1673
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:24,901
LIAM: Laura Bailey manifested.

1674
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:27,667
(laughing)

1675
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:31,367
Oh, harp please, poof!

1676
01:08:31,399 --> 01:08:33,399
MATT: As you guys have
been resting, to be fair,

1677
01:08:33,434 --> 01:08:34,767
as you're all sitting there
in the tunnel kind of talking,

1678
01:08:34,801 --> 01:08:36,773
you hear in the distance
an occasional like

1679
01:08:36,773 --> 01:08:38,200
ting, ting, ting, clunk.

1680
01:08:38,234 --> 01:08:39,600
You look in the distance
and you see Grog

1681
01:08:39,634 --> 01:08:41,667
just like rummaging through
the loot and throwing shit.

1682
01:08:41,701 --> 01:08:43,300
-TRAVIS: Pretty much.
-LAURA: What are you doing?

1683
01:08:43,334 --> 01:08:44,533
TRAVIS: What, I'm trying
to find something.

1684
01:08:44,567 --> 01:08:46,667
There's a giant rolled
up carpet over here.

1685
01:08:46,701 --> 01:08:48,133
LAURA: A carpet?

1686
01:08:48,167 --> 01:08:51,834
TRAVIS: Yeah, I mean some people call
it a telafaphy or whatever.

1687
01:08:51,868 --> 01:08:53,968
LAURA: I go over to Grog.

1688
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,767
What do you
have in your hand?

1689
01:08:55,801 --> 01:08:59,533
TRAVIS: Uh, I don't know, it looks
like a bunch of cards.

1690
01:08:59,567 --> 01:09:00,667
LAURA: Can I see them?

1691
01:09:00,701 --> 01:09:02,033
TRAVIS: No, they're mine,
I found them.

1692
01:09:02,067 --> 01:09:05,968
You have all of this stuff
to choose from, have at it.

1693
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,701
LAURA: What's that tapestry
he's talking about?

1694
01:09:08,734 --> 01:09:10,067
MATT: Uh, the tapestry
that's bound up?

1695
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:10,767
-LAURA: Yeah.
-MATT: Go and make

1696
01:09:10,801 --> 01:09:12,501
an investigation check.

1697
01:09:12,533 --> 01:09:14,167
TALIESIN: I'm gonna start
wandering into this mess.

1698
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:17,200
This is exciting.

1699
01:09:17,234 --> 01:09:18,300
LAURA: Twenty four.

1700
01:09:18,334 --> 01:09:19,834
MATT: Okay, as you quickly go over,

1701
01:09:19,868 --> 01:09:24,267
you find--there are a
number of what look to be

1702
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:25,801
types of decoration,
wall tapestries.

1703
01:09:25,834 --> 01:09:28,868
And there one
that Grog caught

1704
01:09:28,901 --> 01:09:30,533
that it's a very,
very fine material,

1705
01:09:30,567 --> 01:09:31,901
it looks like it's
probably expensive.

1706
01:09:31,934 --> 01:09:34,801
Made of a very deep
dyed navy blue silk

1707
01:09:34,834 --> 01:09:40,167
with looks to be a very, very
light tan pattern across it.

1708
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:44,200
As you unravel it, it's
roughly six foot by nine foot.

1709
01:09:44,234 --> 01:09:46,767
Um, it rolls out
in front of you.

1710
01:09:46,801 --> 01:09:49,734
LAURA: Do you fly, fly?

1711
01:09:49,767 --> 01:09:51,267
Try to fly right now.

1712
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:53,000
Go up in the air.

1713
01:09:53,033 --> 01:09:54,501
(spit)

1714
01:09:54,534 --> 01:09:56,400
-TRAVIS: No.
-PATRICK: Did you just spit on it?

1715
01:09:56,434 --> 01:09:58,901
LAURA: Well, that's my code word
for my flying broom.

1716
01:09:58,934 --> 01:10:01,267
MATT: Chuck on it, you'll fly.

1717
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:03,534
Which sounds like chat-oo!

1718
01:10:03,567 --> 01:10:04,701
MARISHA: Naturally.

1719
01:10:04,734 --> 01:10:05,968
MATT: What do you want to do,

1720
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,434
do you want to spend
some time with the tapestry?

1721
01:10:08,467 --> 01:10:10,300
LAURA: No, I'm gonna roll it up
and save it for later

1722
01:10:10,334 --> 01:10:11,734
and look around
for other cool stuff.

1723
01:10:11,767 --> 01:10:14,267
MATT: Okay, so you grab
the tapestry and roll it up

1724
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:17,033
and toss it to the side.

1725
01:10:17,067 --> 01:10:18,400
TRAVIS: There's really
no way around this,

1726
01:10:18,434 --> 01:10:20,130
I've got to pull a card

1727
01:10:20,130 --> 01:10:22,133
out of the
leather sleeve, right?

1728
01:10:22,167 --> 01:10:23,300
LIAM: Are you gonna take
this fucking tapestry

1729
01:10:23,334 --> 01:10:24,367
or you're gonna
look around the room?

1730
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:25,267
MATT: All right, so you
pull one card out?

1731
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:26,400
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll pull one card out,

1732
01:10:26,434 --> 01:10:28,100
but I want to pull
the one in the middle

1733
01:10:28,133 --> 01:10:30,267
because I remember
magicians be like,

1734
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:31,968
choose a card, any card.

1735
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,234
LIAM: Travis, you could
destroy the world.

1736
01:10:34,267 --> 01:10:35,834
TALIESIN: I'm so excited.

1737
01:10:35,868 --> 01:10:38,077
TRAVIS: I mean, on any day, but you're
lucky I'm really in control.

1738
01:10:38,077 --> 01:10:39,734
LAURA: I don't know what can
come out of that thing,

1739
01:10:39,767 --> 01:10:42,634
but like, really
bad things can come out.

1740
01:10:42,667 --> 01:10:45,200
TRAVIS: What is that, I don't
even know what that is.

1741
01:10:45,234 --> 01:10:47,467
MATT: Ryan, do we have a
deck of cards anywhere?

1742
01:10:47,501 --> 01:10:49,601
MARISHA: Jesus Christ.

1743
01:10:49,634 --> 01:10:51,300
TRAVIS: What is this?

1744
01:10:51,334 --> 01:10:52,100
PATRICK: I probably...

1745
01:10:52,133 --> 01:10:52,968
MATT: Just regular playing cards.

1746
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,267
(Ryan) I'm going to look for some.

1747
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:56,654
TRAVIS: Is it fair to say that everyone
knows what this is but me?

1748
01:10:56,654 --> 01:10:58,100
SAM: I don't know what it is.

1749
01:10:58,133 --> 01:10:59,868
TRAVIS: Sam doesn't know.

1750
01:10:59,901 --> 01:11:02,334
LAURA: I've heard that--oh, God,
there's cards right there.

1751
01:11:02,367 --> 01:11:03,634
They had 'em right there!

1752
01:11:03,667 --> 01:11:04,734
MATT: Thank you.

1753
01:11:04,767 --> 01:11:06,300
TRAVIS: Scanlan doesn't
know what this is.

1754
01:11:06,334 --> 01:11:07,200
Do you know what this is?

1755
01:11:07,234 --> 01:11:08,188
LIAM: Yes.

1756
01:11:08,188 --> 01:11:09,330
TRAVIS: Laura, do you know?

1757
01:11:09,330 --> 01:11:10,934
LAURA: I know it's really--
it can be really bad.

1758
01:11:10,968 --> 01:11:12,467
TRAVIS: Patrick, do you
know what this is?

1759
01:11:12,501 --> 01:11:15,834
LAURA: Didn't they pull this out
during one of the charity games?

1760
01:11:15,868 --> 01:11:20,234
LIAM: Amazing and great or it
could be totally destructive.

1761
01:11:20,267 --> 01:11:22,868
TRAVIS: I'm feeling amazing
and great right now.

1762
01:11:22,901 --> 01:11:26,133
LAURA: Oh, God, oh, God.

1763
01:11:26,167 --> 01:11:28,067
LIAM: Aren't you glad you're here?

1764
01:11:28,067 --> 01:11:30,734
PATRICK: I'm so--there's nothing
I'd rather be here for.

1765
01:11:30,767 --> 01:11:33,300
TRAVIS: Oh really, just straight up?

1766
01:11:33,334 --> 01:11:34,601
MATT: All righty, so.

1767
01:11:34,634 --> 01:11:37,067
TRAVIS: That's unfortunate.

1768
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:40,657
(cross talk)

1769
01:11:40,657 --> 01:11:43,733
LIAM: I'm sweating harder than the
dragon fight right now.

1770
01:11:43,733 --> 01:11:45,868
(cross talk)

1771
01:11:45,901 --> 01:11:47,234
MATT: Be patient here
for a second, folks,

1772
01:11:47,267 --> 01:11:49,000
as I have to pull out the
proper deck here so I know--

1773
01:11:49,033 --> 01:11:50,467
(cross talk)

1774
01:11:50,501 --> 01:11:54,234
As Travis now currently
pulling a card out of

1775
01:11:54,267 --> 01:11:56,834
some sort of enchanted deck.

1776
01:11:56,868 --> 01:11:59,400
TRAVIS: It's called
an enchanted deck?

1777
01:11:59,434 --> 01:12:01,081
LIAM: If he wins, he can win big.

1778
01:12:01,081 --> 01:12:02,868
TRAVIS: Is there a name for it,
whatever this is?

1779
01:12:02,901 --> 01:12:04,167
-PATRICK: Oh, yes.
-TRAVIS: What's the name?

1780
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:05,234
TALIESIN: Idiocy.

1781
01:12:05,267 --> 01:12:06,601
LIAM: Yes.

1782
01:12:06,634 --> 01:12:07,667
LIAM: We'll tell you later.

1783
01:12:07,701 --> 01:12:09,434
(cross talk)

1784
01:12:09,467 --> 01:12:11,501
'Cause we're all
out of character.

1785
01:12:11,534 --> 01:12:12,701
TRAVIS: I genuinely
am only doing this

1786
01:12:12,734 --> 01:12:14,467
because I don't know
what the hell it is.

1787
01:12:14,501 --> 01:12:18,234
PATRICK: Which is perfect,
it's perfect, perfect.

1788
01:12:18,267 --> 01:12:19,767
This could not be better.

1789
01:12:19,801 --> 01:12:22,247
Although honestly, they're
like--and into the lava

1790
01:12:22,247 --> 01:12:23,701
would also be perfect, yeah.

1791
01:12:23,734 --> 01:12:26,000
MARISHA: That would be perfect, yeah.

1792
01:12:26,033 --> 01:12:28,133
TRAVIS: Would that have activated
all of them and then...?

1793
01:12:28,167 --> 01:12:29,834
LAURA: I don't know.

1794
01:12:29,868 --> 01:12:31,801
MARISHA: You can't really destroy
magical items though, right?

1795
01:12:31,834 --> 01:12:34,227
TALIESIN: No, they would have just
put them into the rock.

1796
01:12:34,227 --> 01:12:35,701
TRAVIS: Oh, they're magical...

1797
01:12:35,734 --> 01:12:37,367
MATT: In my rush to
get everything ready,

1798
01:12:37,367 --> 01:12:38,868
-I did not...
-SAM: How dare you.

1799
01:12:38,901 --> 01:12:41,734
LAURA: How dare you not prepare?

1800
01:12:41,767 --> 01:12:44,067
MATT: Well, there was that too,
but you know.

1801
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:46,300
I learn lessons
the hard way sometimes.

1802
01:12:46,334 --> 01:12:48,067
LAURA: If Travis gets
a hold of it...

1803
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:50,067
LIAM: Not ready for eSports, Matt.

1804
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:51,634
(laughing)

1805
01:12:51,667 --> 01:12:53,061
MATT: I hate you so much.

1806
01:12:53,061 --> 01:12:54,801
(laughing)

1807
01:12:54,834 --> 01:12:57,834
TRAVIS: Not ready for...

1808
01:12:57,868 --> 01:12:59,367
-MATT: Okay.
-TALIESIN: So excited.

1809
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:02,000
LAURA: Oh, God, I'm terrified.

1810
01:13:02,033 --> 01:13:04,200
I don't know what all the
things are that they can do.

1811
01:13:04,234 --> 01:13:05,367
TALIESIN: I don't think I would
have the guts to do it.

1812
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:07,200
I think--'cause I would know,

1813
01:13:07,234 --> 01:13:08,634
I would not have the guts.

1814
01:13:08,667 --> 01:13:10,334
TRAVIS: 'Cause you know what it is.

1815
01:13:10,367 --> 01:13:12,868
Well, there's like 13 cards,
how bad can it be?

1816
01:13:12,901 --> 01:13:14,934
What's the percentage
of bad cards to good cards?

1817
01:13:14,968 --> 01:13:16,267
LIAM: It's mostly bad.

1818
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:17,634
TRAVIS: It's mostly bad?

1819
01:13:17,667 --> 01:13:19,901
LAURA: Do you know, you know,
you know all the cards.

1820
01:13:19,934 --> 01:13:20,901
LIAM: But the goods are amazing.

1821
01:13:20,934 --> 01:13:22,493
MATT: Shuffle these
here for a minute.

1822
01:13:22,493 --> 01:13:24,133
LAURA: Oh, God, oh, God!

1823
01:13:24,167 --> 01:13:26,640
Oh, my God, what if
we're all about to die?

1824
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,467
'Cause it could
be world ending, right?

1825
01:13:28,501 --> 01:13:29,667
It could just...

1826
01:13:29,701 --> 01:13:33,067
MARISHA: I'm with Kerr
in the hall, right?

1827
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:35,000
MATT: You guys are all just resting.

1828
01:13:35,033 --> 01:13:38,000
And Vax is asleep.

1829
01:13:38,033 --> 01:13:40,334
SAM: I'm checking to see if
there's any more in the flute

1830
01:13:40,367 --> 01:13:42,334
that didn't get burned.

1831
01:13:42,367 --> 01:13:45,334
-MATT: Uh...
-LIAM: Now is the time.

1832
01:13:45,367 --> 01:13:47,400
TALIESIN: Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

1833
01:13:47,434 --> 01:13:48,868
MATT: Literally.

1834
01:13:48,901 --> 01:13:50,267
As you check the flute,

1835
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:54,901
what you put in the flute
has been expended, yes.

1836
01:13:54,934 --> 01:14:00,601
All right, so I want you
to just pull one of these--

1837
01:14:00,634 --> 01:14:02,868
I'll turn them around, shuffle.

1838
01:14:02,901 --> 01:14:04,000
TRAVIS: How many pulls do I get?

1839
01:14:04,033 --> 01:14:05,710
MATT: You said you were
just pulling one card,

1840
01:14:05,710 --> 01:14:07,801
so you pull one card.

1841
01:14:07,834 --> 01:14:10,000
TALIESIN: Only Travis,
Travis is the only one.

1842
01:14:10,033 --> 01:14:10,968
MATT: What's it say?

1843
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,434
MARISHA: You have this
conviction to your voice

1844
01:14:12,467 --> 01:14:14,501
that's just--I believe you.

1845
01:14:14,534 --> 01:14:16,267
PATRICK: I'm very calming.

1846
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:17,567
MATT: All right, good to know.

1847
01:14:17,601 --> 01:14:18,634
SAM: Good to know.

1848
01:14:18,667 --> 01:14:21,234
Oh, good to know,
you all die.

1849
01:14:21,267 --> 01:14:22,767
LAURA: It's a giant...

1850
01:14:22,801 --> 01:14:25,267
TALIESIN: No, don't look at the screen,
don't look at the screen.

1851
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:27,100
That's not gonna
make anyone feel better.

1852
01:14:27,133 --> 01:14:29,767
(cross talk)

1853
01:14:29,801 --> 01:14:31,267
MARISHA: 50 gold, 50--
50,000 gold.

1854
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:32,534
LIAM: No whammies, no whammies.

1855
01:14:32,567 --> 01:14:33,434
MATT: Okay.

1856
01:14:33,467 --> 01:14:34,868
SAM: He's turning more pages, why?

1857
01:14:34,901 --> 01:14:36,367
Why more pages?

1858
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:37,567
PATRICK: I'm actually sweating.

1859
01:14:37,601 --> 01:14:39,234
SAM: You should only
be on one page.

1860
01:14:39,267 --> 01:14:41,634
Why would he need to be
on multiple pages?

1861
01:14:41,667 --> 01:14:43,467
(cross talk)

1862
01:14:43,501 --> 01:14:47,300
TALIESIN: It's a centerfold.

1863
01:14:47,334 --> 01:14:49,934
LIAM: It's the most powerful
thing in the book.

1864
01:14:49,968 --> 01:14:51,434
MATT: Okay, hold on, I have
to go back for a--

1865
01:14:51,467 --> 01:14:53,033
SAM: Why are there
more pages, Matt?

1866
01:14:53,067 --> 01:14:55,234
MATT: You'll find out,
you'll find out.

1867
01:14:55,267 --> 01:14:57,434
TRAVIS: Why would you give me that?!

1868
01:14:57,467 --> 01:14:59,901
(laughing)

1869
01:14:59,934 --> 01:15:02,300
MARISHA: I was asking
the same question.

1870
01:15:02,334 --> 01:15:03,868
TRAVIS: You give me
like chastity belts or--

1871
01:15:03,901 --> 01:15:06,367
MATT: Look, man, the last
thing I expected was Grog

1872
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,901
to be the first to loot
for magical items.

1873
01:15:08,934 --> 01:15:11,400
And roll a decent
investigation check.

1874
01:15:11,434 --> 01:15:15,667
And yet, here you are,
discovering this deck.

1875
01:15:15,701 --> 01:15:17,601
All right, so...

1876
01:15:17,634 --> 01:15:20,133
With this...

1877
01:15:20,167 --> 01:15:24,534
You pull the card out and it
looks like this beautiful

1878
01:15:24,567 --> 01:15:28,067
tarot like design of what
looks like a metallic key

1879
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:30,801
that is currently
held aloft in space

1880
01:15:30,834 --> 01:15:33,200
behind what looks
like almost like the stars

1881
01:15:33,234 --> 01:15:39,167
converging into some sort of
a pattern in the night sky.

1882
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:40,977
TRAVIS: That's good, stars are nice.

1883
01:15:40,977 --> 01:15:42,167
MATT: At this point--

1884
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:43,467
TRAVIS: Orion wouldn't fuck us.

1885
01:15:43,501 --> 01:15:45,400
LIAM: Nope.

1886
01:15:45,434 --> 01:15:50,200
PATRICK: That's not a
sword on his belt.

1887
01:15:50,234 --> 01:15:51,667
MATT: As you pull the card
and look at it,

1888
01:15:51,701 --> 01:15:55,501
the card bursts into flames,

1889
01:15:55,534 --> 01:15:57,868
and you feel this slight
tingling in the hand

1890
01:15:57,901 --> 01:16:01,567
that held the card.

1891
01:16:01,601 --> 01:16:04,267
Suddenly, you watch as
there's a flash of light

1892
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:06,267
within your grasp with
what looks to be extending

1893
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:08,801
from where the card once was.

1894
01:16:08,834 --> 01:16:12,601
You immediately feel
something steel in your hand

1895
01:16:12,634 --> 01:16:14,400
and as you clutch your fingers
instinctually around it,

1896
01:16:14,434 --> 01:16:16,100
and try to crush
whatever it is,

1897
01:16:16,133 --> 01:16:20,868
you look and watch as this
beautiful looking scimitar

1898
01:16:20,901 --> 01:16:23,334
like blade is now
in your grasp.

1899
01:16:23,367 --> 01:16:25,968
TRAVIS: Oooh!

1900
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,400
Whoa.

1901
01:16:27,434 --> 01:16:33,400
MATT: It's beautifully made,
an ornate hilt and hand guard.

1902
01:16:33,434 --> 01:16:36,334
And it has like a chain dangling
from the bottom of the pommel

1903
01:16:36,367 --> 01:16:39,100
that has, looks like
a small blue gem.

1904
01:16:39,133 --> 01:16:40,934
It's a beautiful
looking piece of weaponry.

1905
01:16:40,968 --> 01:16:42,033
And as you whip
it back and forth,

1906
01:16:42,067 --> 01:16:43,367
it's perfectly balanced.

1907
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:47,200
TRAVIS: Does it make any noise
when I swing it?

1908
01:16:47,234 --> 01:16:49,267
LAURA: A card turned into a sword?

1909
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:51,567
SAM: We should pull the other cards
to see what swords they'll make.

1910
01:16:51,601 --> 01:16:53,234
PATRICK: You can do that 12 more times!

1911
01:16:53,267 --> 01:16:55,701
TRAVIS: I'm apparently the
most powerful sorcerer

1912
01:16:55,734 --> 01:16:57,667
that has ever lived.

1913
01:16:57,701 --> 01:17:00,634
SAM: This is a deck
of weapon cards.

1914
01:17:00,667 --> 01:17:02,934
LAURA: I mean seriously, though.

1915
01:17:02,968 --> 01:17:05,334
TRAVIS: I have to hit
something with it.

1916
01:17:05,367 --> 01:17:06,567
LAURA: Well, go hit
something with it.

1917
01:17:06,601 --> 01:17:09,901
TRAVIS: Is there like a tall
statue around or anything?

1918
01:17:09,934 --> 01:17:13,100
MATT: I mean, you can see
there are a few marble busts

1919
01:17:13,133 --> 01:17:17,100
and things that have been
collected from the more--

1920
01:17:17,133 --> 01:17:18,667
TRAVIS: A marble bust is good,
that's perfect.

1921
01:17:18,701 --> 01:17:20,204
TALIESIN: Please don't
decimate the antiquities.

1922
01:17:20,204 --> 01:17:21,634
TRAVIS: Can I pick it up?

1923
01:17:21,667 --> 01:17:23,000
Lob it--

1924
01:17:23,033 --> 01:17:25,400
LAURA: Grog, also don't forget
this is property of Emon.

1925
01:17:25,434 --> 01:17:26,734
TRAVIS: It just broke because
you distracted me.

1926
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:29,968
(laughing)

1927
01:17:32,501 --> 01:17:34,701
I've got to go
find another bust.

1928
01:17:34,734 --> 01:17:36,027
Is there another?

1929
01:17:36,027 --> 01:17:37,457
MATT: There are a few, yeah.

1930
01:17:37,457 --> 01:17:39,100
TRAVIS: Thank God there's another.

1931
01:17:39,133 --> 01:17:41,841
MATT: You need to recognize,
some of these used to exist

1932
01:17:41,841 --> 01:17:43,230
in the Alabaster Lyceum.

1933
01:17:43,234 --> 01:17:47,033
These are actually busts
of old heralded teachers

1934
01:17:47,067 --> 01:17:50,680
within the arcane halls
of the lyceum.

1935
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:53,133
-TRAVIS: They wrote on stuff, right?
-MATT: Yeah.

1936
01:17:53,167 --> 01:17:55,967
TRAVIS: Okay, then nobody cares
what they looked like, cool.

1937
01:17:55,967 --> 01:17:58,234
Take it and lob it
in the air, big swing.

1938
01:17:58,267 --> 01:18:00,531
-MATT: Make an attack roll.
-TRAVIS: Okay.

1939
01:18:01,894 --> 01:18:03,767
Can I make this
a reckless attack?

1940
01:18:03,801 --> 01:18:05,667
MATT: You can.

1941
01:18:05,701 --> 01:18:08,144
TALIESIN: Is it a strength
or dex weapon?

1942
01:18:08,144 --> 01:18:09,467
MATT: It's a strength weapon.

1943
01:18:09,501 --> 01:18:10,270
TALIESIN: Ah.

1944
01:18:10,270 --> 01:18:11,567
TRAVIS: Twenty seven.

1945
01:18:11,601 --> 01:18:14,400
MATT: Twenty seven.
Um, roll damage.

1946
01:18:14,434 --> 01:18:17,534
It is considered a scimitar.

1947
01:18:17,567 --> 01:18:18,367
TRAVIS: Okay.

1948
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:19,567
LAURA: A scimitar.

1949
01:18:19,601 --> 01:18:21,667
MATT: It's a d8, I believe.

1950
01:18:23,801 --> 01:18:26,297
MARISHA: It's considered a scimitar.

1951
01:18:26,297 --> 01:18:27,601
TALIESIN: But really.

1952
01:18:27,634 --> 01:18:30,067
PATRICK: It looks exactly
like a scimitar.

1953
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:31,340
TALIESIN: It's a meal.

1954
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:35,300
(cross talk)

1955
01:18:35,334 --> 01:18:38,534
TRAVIS: I'm kind of doing it
off of the blood axe, so like 16?

1956
01:18:38,567 --> 01:18:40,400
No necrotic no--

1957
01:18:40,434 --> 01:18:42,100
MATT: No, no magical bonus on it.

1958
01:18:42,133 --> 01:18:44,154
-TRAVIS: Just 16.
-MATT: 16, okay.

1959
01:18:44,154 --> 01:18:45,868
And with your gauntlets
you have siege,

1960
01:18:45,901 --> 01:18:48,027
which means you
do double damage

1961
01:18:48,027 --> 01:18:49,467
against objects and structures.

1962
01:18:49,501 --> 01:18:50,854
So as you take the sword back

1963
01:18:50,854 --> 01:18:52,467
you strike the
edge of this bust

1964
01:18:52,501 --> 01:18:56,400
and watch it just
turn to gravel and dust.

1965
01:18:56,434 --> 01:18:59,117
Pshhh, it just shatters
and explodes out the side

1966
01:18:59,117 --> 01:19:00,601
with one singular swing

1967
01:19:00,634 --> 01:19:02,847
and you watch as
the small chunks of rock

1968
01:19:02,847 --> 01:19:05,334
that still somewhat
resemble any sort of, you know,

1969
01:19:05,367 --> 01:19:10,033
sculptured structure go
scattering across the black,

1970
01:19:10,067 --> 01:19:12,868
you know, lava and magma
encrusted darkened floor

1971
01:19:12,901 --> 01:19:14,734
of the cavern.

1972
01:19:14,767 --> 01:19:16,334
Blade is untouched.

1973
01:19:16,367 --> 01:19:18,934
TRAVIS: It is really
well balanced, that is,

1974
01:19:18,968 --> 01:19:21,711
and I just hold
it up to my ear.

1975
01:19:22,934 --> 01:19:24,767
(laughing)

1976
01:19:24,801 --> 01:19:26,734
MATT: A moment passes.

1977
01:19:26,767 --> 01:19:28,000
A second moment passes.

1978
01:19:28,033 --> 01:19:29,700
-TRAVIS: We're good.
-LAURA: Yeah.

1979
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:30,868
TRAVIS: We're totally good.

1980
01:19:30,901 --> 01:19:32,161
SAM: It's a cool weapon.

1981
01:19:32,161 --> 01:19:33,133
TRAVIS: It is, yeah.

1982
01:19:33,167 --> 01:19:38,854
And I stealthily try
and pocket the other cards.

1983
01:19:39,868 --> 01:19:41,501
LAURA: What are you doing?

1984
01:19:41,534 --> 01:19:45,133
TRAVIS: But I haven't showered in
a few days and my bum itches.

1985
01:19:45,167 --> 01:19:47,431
MATT: Make a slight of
hand check, Grog.

1986
01:19:47,431 --> 01:19:50,160
(laughing)

1987
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:52,133
TRAVIS: Shit, that's a natural 1!

1988
01:19:52,167 --> 01:19:54,767
(laughing)

1989
01:19:54,801 --> 01:19:56,300
God damn it!

1990
01:19:56,334 --> 01:20:00,200
MATT: You watch as Grog so
discreetly takes the cards

1991
01:20:00,234 --> 01:20:02,601
and just kind of throws them.

1992
01:20:02,634 --> 01:20:05,817
(laughing)

1993
01:20:05,817 --> 01:20:07,580
Somehow throws
them closer to you

1994
01:20:07,580 --> 01:20:09,133
and in between
him and you guys,

1995
01:20:09,167 --> 01:20:10,971
trying to hide them
and just go thdummp.

1996
01:20:10,971 --> 01:20:12,367
LAURA: I pick them up.

1997
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:13,734
SAM: Does anyone know
what these are?

1998
01:20:13,767 --> 01:20:15,601
LAURA: Grog just made a sword
out of one of these cards.

1999
01:20:15,634 --> 01:20:16,734
Do we know what this is?

2000
01:20:16,767 --> 01:20:18,367
TRAVIS: They only activate
under my magical touch.

2001
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:20,837
SAM: I'm gonna look at it
and just see if I happen

2002
01:20:20,837 --> 01:20:22,133
to know anything about it.

2003
01:20:22,167 --> 01:20:23,687
MATT: Roll an arcana check.

2004
01:20:23,687 --> 01:20:26,334
SAM: I don't know
anything about it.

2005
01:20:26,367 --> 01:20:28,834
I rolled a 12, do I
know anything about it?

2006
01:20:28,868 --> 01:20:31,300
MATT: Mmm, they're
apparently magical.

2007
01:20:31,334 --> 01:20:32,501
TALIESIN: Twenty three.

2008
01:20:32,534 --> 01:20:36,167
MATT: Twenty three.
You, being a studious child

2009
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:38,770
and reading many things,
you've heard rumors,

2010
01:20:38,770 --> 01:20:40,033
you have heard myths,

2011
01:20:40,067 --> 01:20:43,367
you have heard
legends of glory and woe

2012
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:45,434
based around an
artifact referred to

2013
01:20:45,467 --> 01:20:47,067
as the Deck of Many Things.

2014
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:48,901
LAURA: I start to open it up and--

2015
01:20:48,934 --> 01:20:50,934
TALIESIN: No, no, no, no.

2016
01:20:50,968 --> 01:20:52,801
No, oh, he looks--

2017
01:20:52,834 --> 01:20:54,868
LAURA: I think these made weapons.

2018
01:20:54,901 --> 01:20:56,868
TALIESIN: They can make
a lot of things.

2019
01:20:56,901 --> 01:20:58,281
SAM: Can they make bad things?

2020
01:20:58,281 --> 01:21:00,133
TALIESIN: They can make a
lot of bad things.

2021
01:21:00,167 --> 01:21:01,767
SAM: And do you know
what activates them,

2022
01:21:01,801 --> 01:21:03,100
just looking at a card?

2023
01:21:03,133 --> 01:21:05,868
TALIESIN: If I recall,
it doesn't take much.

2024
01:21:05,901 --> 01:21:08,957
LAURA: I just shut the little
case and stuff it in my...

2025
01:21:08,957 --> 01:21:10,284
SAM: Let's keep it.

2026
01:21:10,284 --> 01:21:12,200
TALIESIN: I was going to say
let's put it somewhere

2027
01:21:12,234 --> 01:21:14,080
where no one will
ever find it,

2028
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:16,000
but that will
be fine for now.

2029
01:21:16,033 --> 01:21:19,100
TRAVIS: May, may I--I actually,
I found that.

2030
01:21:19,133 --> 01:21:20,901
LAURA: Oh, Grog, that's sweet.

2031
01:21:20,934 --> 01:21:23,501
TRAVIS: But I don't, I want to
hold on to it, it's mine.

2032
01:21:23,534 --> 01:21:24,501
LAURA: No.

2033
01:21:24,534 --> 01:21:26,501
TRAVIS: You can keep
all the other gold.

2034
01:21:26,534 --> 01:21:28,968
LAURA: Yeah, no, I don't
trust you with it.

2035
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:29,801
TRAVIS: Why not?

2036
01:21:29,834 --> 01:21:30,884
LAURA: Because you do stupid things.

2037
01:21:30,884 --> 01:21:32,067
TRAVIS: Look what I made.

2038
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:33,834
LAURA: You made a beautiful sword
and I'm proud of you.

2039
01:21:33,868 --> 01:21:36,167
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm sure it's like
reactive its user--

2040
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:39,464
LAURA: Maybe there's another set
in here, we should find it!

2041
01:21:39,464 --> 01:21:41,133
TRAVIS: And then you can have it.

2042
01:21:41,167 --> 01:21:44,424
LAURA: No, if we find another set,
you can have it.

2043
01:21:45,467 --> 01:21:47,127
LIAM: That's a bad deal, too.

2044
01:21:47,127 --> 01:21:49,847
TRAVIS: I go to look for
another Deck of Many Things

2045
01:21:49,847 --> 01:21:51,361
and nothing else.

2046
01:21:51,361 --> 01:21:52,734
(laughing)

2047
01:21:52,767 --> 01:21:55,634
MATT: For all the gold
that is in this cavern,

2048
01:21:55,667 --> 01:21:59,834
none of it has any
luster or shine to you

2049
01:21:59,868 --> 01:22:02,567
as your singularly focused
on finding another one

2050
01:22:02,601 --> 01:22:04,000
of these deck of cards.

2051
01:22:04,033 --> 01:22:07,100
You are throwing handfuls of
platinum over your shoulder.

2052
01:22:07,133 --> 01:22:08,400
TRAVIS: Garbage.

2053
01:22:08,434 --> 01:22:09,968
Rubbish, filth.

2054
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,434
(laughing)

2055
01:22:11,467 --> 01:22:14,033
Life has no luster
to it anymore.

2056
01:22:14,067 --> 01:22:15,968
You wretched...

2057
01:22:17,567 --> 01:22:21,434
MATT: All right, so continuing off of
your investigation check--

2058
01:22:21,467 --> 01:22:23,567
-LIAM: What a heart attack.
-TALIESIN: Wow.

2059
01:22:23,601 --> 01:22:25,734
MATT: So you do have the
Deck of Many Things

2060
01:22:25,767 --> 01:22:27,200
which now has
12 cards in it.

2061
01:22:27,234 --> 01:22:28,434
LAURA: Oh, my God.

2062
01:22:28,467 --> 01:22:29,634
TALIESIN: Ah!

2063
01:22:29,667 --> 01:22:31,400
MATT: I'm gonna hand that to Laura.

2064
01:22:31,434 --> 01:22:35,267
SAM: Next time I go back to casino,
I'm taking that with me.

2065
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:37,434
MATT: You do--you
have that tapestry.

2066
01:22:37,467 --> 01:22:41,367
You have--you find what
looks to be a pair of very fine

2067
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:44,400
crafted dark
green leather boots

2068
01:22:44,434 --> 01:22:46,868
that have almost a silver
or platinum scrolling

2069
01:22:46,901 --> 01:22:48,484
along the edges
of the leather,

2070
01:22:48,484 --> 01:22:50,017
almost like
leaves and branches

2071
01:22:50,017 --> 01:22:52,501
that tangle in towards
the front of the foot.

2072
01:22:52,534 --> 01:22:53,968
LAURA: Do they look Elvish?

2073
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,300
MATT: It looks Elvish in design.

2074
01:22:56,334 --> 01:22:57,968
And you find
what looks to be

2075
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:03,267
a very, very well
crafted war hammer.

2076
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:06,898
It has--its shape
and its design is--

2077
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,167
and only because you've seen
this type of handle before--

2078
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:12,534
it appears to be
Dwarven in make.

2079
01:23:12,567 --> 01:23:16,934
And it has a
series of runes and glyphs

2080
01:23:16,968 --> 01:23:19,834
along the sides of
the war hammer head itself

2081
01:23:19,868 --> 01:23:23,154
that seem to
give you the sense

2082
01:23:23,154 --> 01:23:24,701
that this is a very expensive,

2083
01:23:24,734 --> 01:23:27,467
or at least a very, very
elegantly crafted weapon.

2084
01:23:27,501 --> 01:23:29,000
LAURA: Okay.

2085
01:23:33,567 --> 01:23:35,067
Sweet.

2086
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:38,133
I can't, can I see if
they're magic, I can't can I?

2087
01:23:38,167 --> 01:23:41,567
MATT: I mean, you can take
the rest of your short rest

2088
01:23:41,601 --> 01:23:43,501
with one of the objects

2089
01:23:43,534 --> 01:23:45,644
to see if you can
ascertain any sort of magic

2090
01:23:45,644 --> 01:23:47,094
or information about it.

2091
01:23:47,094 --> 01:23:49,400
LAURA: I'm gonna do that
on the tapestry.

2092
01:23:49,434 --> 01:23:50,534
MATT: Okay.

2093
01:23:50,567 --> 01:23:52,133
-TALIESIN: I'm with you.
-LAURA: Fly, fly for me.

2094
01:23:52,167 --> 01:23:54,000
MATT: All right,
the rest of you guys,

2095
01:23:54,033 --> 01:23:56,033
is there anything else should
rest, just healing up?

2096
01:23:56,067 --> 01:23:57,937
TALIESIN: Healing up,
fixing my guns,

2097
01:23:57,937 --> 01:23:59,997
and then sort of
trying to navigate

2098
01:23:59,997 --> 01:24:01,467
some of this crazy in here

2099
01:24:01,501 --> 01:24:03,033
and then eventually
looking around the cavern

2100
01:24:03,067 --> 01:24:04,067
to see if there's anything.

2101
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:05,834
MATT: Has everyone
spent their hit dice?

2102
01:24:05,868 --> 01:24:07,367
What are we at
in point totals here?

2103
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:08,968
SAM: Sixty eight.

2104
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,334
TALIESIN: I've got 102.

2105
01:24:10,367 --> 01:24:11,701
MARISHA: Seventy nine.

2106
01:24:11,734 --> 01:24:12,667
MATT: I think you're still full.

2107
01:24:12,701 --> 01:24:14,067
LIAM: Ninety nine.

2108
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:15,534
LAURA: One hundred.

2109
01:24:15,567 --> 01:24:17,434
TRAVIS: I didn't roll any 'cause
I was looking through this

2110
01:24:17,467 --> 01:24:19,974
Deck of Many Things!
90.

2111
01:24:20,767 --> 01:24:22,033
MATT: Ninety, okay.

2112
01:24:22,067 --> 01:24:24,741
At the end
of the short rest,

2113
01:24:26,934 --> 01:24:30,501
Vex, you've taken the
time with the tapestry,

2114
01:24:30,534 --> 01:24:31,934
looking at it.

2115
01:24:31,968 --> 01:24:34,234
Its design kind of
hurts your heart a little bit

2116
01:24:34,267 --> 01:24:37,104
'cause it reminds you of the
flying carpet that you once had

2117
01:24:37,104 --> 01:24:39,767
and you're like
hoping and praying.

2118
01:24:39,801 --> 01:24:42,467
And as it--as you're
concentrating on it,

2119
01:24:42,501 --> 01:24:44,968
and hoping that
something comes to you,

2120
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:51,567
you're like, "Fly,"
you know, "Go."

2121
01:24:51,601 --> 01:24:53,037
"Traverse, carry."

2122
01:24:53,037 --> 01:24:54,961
You're just throwing
all these words out.

2123
01:24:54,961 --> 01:24:57,364
And as you're just getting
more and more exhausted,

2124
01:24:57,364 --> 01:24:59,667
and the rest of your
party kind of look over

2125
01:24:59,667 --> 01:25:02,067
with this, "Oh, give it up,
girl," kind of look

2126
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:03,701
and shaking their head,

2127
01:25:03,734 --> 01:25:06,934
a sudden hit of
inspiration hits your mind

2128
01:25:06,968 --> 01:25:08,901
and clarifies--the word "lift."

2129
01:25:08,934 --> 01:25:11,834
You say lift and the tapestry
goes fll fll fll.

2130
01:25:11,868 --> 01:25:15,280
LAURA: Shut the fucking--!

2131
01:25:16,033 --> 01:25:17,000
You guys!

2132
01:25:17,033 --> 01:25:19,434
VAX: (snoring)

2133
01:25:19,467 --> 01:25:22,267
TRAVIS: It's a flying telefaphy.

2134
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:24,667
LAURA: Lift higher.

2135
01:25:24,701 --> 01:25:27,297
♪ High up in love ♪♪

2136
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:30,367
SAM: Another flying carpet.

2137
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:32,234
LAURA: Oh, you guys,
this is wonderful.

2138
01:25:32,267 --> 01:25:34,707
TALIESIN: I legitimately think this
is the one she tried to replace

2139
01:25:34,707 --> 01:25:35,891
the one we stole.

2140
01:25:35,891 --> 01:25:37,067
TRAVIS: Wwwaahhhhhhh.

2141
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:38,000
LAURA: Waahhhhhh.

2142
01:25:38,033 --> 01:25:39,687
LIAM: It's Allura's other carpet.

2143
01:25:39,687 --> 01:25:40,780
TALIESIN: It's her other carpet.

2144
01:25:40,780 --> 01:25:42,860
-LAURA: Oh, shit.
-MARISHA: She collects magical carpets.

2145
01:25:42,860 --> 01:25:45,171
TALIESIN: Well, she should
only ever needs one,

2146
01:25:45,171 --> 01:25:47,367
we just keep taking it.

2147
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:49,701
SAM: Does it say
how much weight it can hold?

2148
01:25:49,734 --> 01:25:51,133
TRAVIS: Eight hundred.

2149
01:25:51,167 --> 01:25:52,167
LAURA: Eight hundred pounds, it can
carry more than the last one.

2150
01:25:52,167 --> 01:25:54,534
SAM: How big is Grog?

2151
01:25:54,534 --> 01:25:56,934
MARISHA: Ah, is it a bigger tapestry?

2152
01:25:56,968 --> 01:25:58,067
LAURA: It's six by nine.

2153
01:25:58,100 --> 01:25:59,300
TRAVIS: Like three hundred.

2154
01:25:59,334 --> 01:26:00,968
LAURA: This is like the
California king version.

2155
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,100
MATT: Bigger than the one
you had before, yeah.

2156
01:26:02,133 --> 01:26:04,400
MARISHA: It's a California
king version.

2157
01:26:04,434 --> 01:26:06,300
SAM: Grog can get on that
and go hit things.

2158
01:26:06,334 --> 01:26:08,684
TRAVIS: Yeah flying speed of 30,
I can run faster than that.

2159
01:26:08,684 --> 01:26:10,917
MARISHA: Can you be like a
Silver Surfer thing?

2160
01:26:10,917 --> 01:26:12,601
TRAVIS: Blaaaaah, yeah.

2161
01:26:12,634 --> 01:26:13,934
MARISHA: Ya!

2162
01:26:13,968 --> 01:26:17,100
LAURA: What's my carrying
capacity on my broom?

2163
01:26:17,133 --> 01:26:18,901
MATT: Uh...

2164
01:26:18,934 --> 01:26:20,900
LAURA: I should probably know this.

2165
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:26,567
MATT: Your broom can carry, uh,
it can carry 400 pounds

2166
01:26:26,601 --> 01:26:28,133
at a flying speed of 30.

2167
01:26:28,167 --> 01:26:29,300
LAURA: Well good, so...

2168
01:26:29,334 --> 01:26:31,227
MATT: Sorry, it can
carry 400 pounds,

2169
01:26:31,227 --> 01:26:32,797
but its flying
speed becomes 30

2170
01:26:32,797 --> 01:26:34,354
while carrying
over 200 pounds.

2171
01:26:34,354 --> 01:26:35,300
LAURA: Okay.

2172
01:26:35,334 --> 01:26:38,334
Oh, this is amazing.

2173
01:26:38,367 --> 01:26:39,834
SAM: That's a good find.

2174
01:26:39,868 --> 01:26:42,210
-TALIESIN: That's a very useful find.
-LAURA: This is some good stuff.

2175
01:26:42,234 --> 01:26:45,200
MARISHA: Vex, does it look
like our old carpet?

2176
01:26:45,234 --> 01:26:47,574
LAURA: I mean, it looks similar,
it's a bit bigger.

2177
01:26:47,574 --> 01:26:50,404
MARISHA: Does it looks like they were
maybe in the same family?

2178
01:26:50,404 --> 01:26:52,133
-LAURA: Definitely, Keyleth.
-MARISHA: Yeah?

2179
01:26:52,167 --> 01:26:53,734
LAURA: Hey, look at
these boots,

2180
01:26:53,734 --> 01:26:55,318
I throw them down to you.

2181
01:26:55,318 --> 01:26:56,934
They look kind of Druidish.

2182
01:26:56,968 --> 01:26:59,100
MARISHA: They do look Druidish.

2183
01:26:59,133 --> 01:27:01,133
Do they look Druidish?

2184
01:27:01,167 --> 01:27:03,934
-MATT: Roll an arcana check.
-MARISHA: Okay.

2185
01:27:03,968 --> 01:27:06,000
♪

2186
01:27:06,033 --> 01:27:07,300
Five.

2187
01:27:07,334 --> 01:27:09,534
MATT: They look pretty.

2188
01:27:09,567 --> 01:27:11,334
-MARISHA: These are so pretty!
-LAURA: I know, right?

2189
01:27:11,367 --> 01:27:12,647
MARISHA: Oh, my gosh.

2190
01:27:12,647 --> 01:27:14,104
LAURA: I think the color looks nice,

2191
01:27:14,104 --> 01:27:15,718
it would look good
with your dress.

2192
01:27:15,718 --> 01:27:17,834
MARISHA: Okay, I'll
look at these later.

2193
01:27:17,868 --> 01:27:20,634
MATT: They're nicer than
the boots you have on.

2194
01:27:20,667 --> 01:27:23,033
TRAVIS: Ooh, that's a diss
on your boots, dog.

2195
01:27:23,067 --> 01:27:24,434
MARISHA: I, well...

2196
01:27:24,467 --> 01:27:27,051
MATT: They don't necessarily
match the ensemble, per se,

2197
01:27:27,051 --> 01:27:28,467
but they're nice boots.

2198
01:27:28,501 --> 01:27:31,067
MARISHA: The soles are
a little melted now.

2199
01:27:31,100 --> 01:27:32,868
LAURA: I mean basically Keyleth
would be naked this whole time

2200
01:27:32,901 --> 01:27:35,067
'cause all of her clothes would
have burned off in the lava.

2201
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:37,084
MATT: This is the magical
world of fantasy

2202
01:27:37,084 --> 01:27:39,100
in which characters don't
suddenly lose all their clothing

2203
01:27:39,133 --> 01:27:41,767
or facial hair or body hair
because of magical spells.

2204
01:27:41,801 --> 01:27:43,234
LAURA: All right, sure, whatever.

2205
01:27:43,267 --> 01:27:45,501
MARISHA: Sounds like that Japanese RPG.

2206
01:27:45,534 --> 01:27:48,264
(cross talk)

2207
01:27:48,264 --> 01:27:50,177
MATT: I'm sure there
are RPGs out there

2208
01:27:50,177 --> 01:27:51,400
that let you do that.

2209
01:27:51,434 --> 01:27:53,400
I'm sure Lamentations
of the Flame Princess

2210
01:27:53,434 --> 01:27:55,000
lets you do that.

2211
01:27:55,033 --> 01:27:57,634
I think there's
actually some exalted

2212
01:27:57,667 --> 01:28:00,300
expansions that let you do that.

2213
01:28:00,334 --> 01:28:02,234
Not this game.

2214
01:28:02,267 --> 01:28:05,200
The fan artists take
care of that for us.

2215
01:28:05,234 --> 01:28:08,834
TALIESIN: And with that, yeah, I'd love
to take a look around the room,

2216
01:28:08,868 --> 01:28:10,934
see if anything
captures my eye.

2217
01:28:10,968 --> 01:28:13,297
MARISHA: I think also,
I think Keyleth's hair

2218
01:28:13,297 --> 01:28:15,324
would probably
be shorter now again,

2219
01:28:15,324 --> 01:28:16,714
thanks to the fire, again.

2220
01:28:16,714 --> 01:28:18,167
MATT: Yeah, sure.

2221
01:28:18,167 --> 01:28:20,000
LAURA: Ooh, can I fly
up on the carpet

2222
01:28:20,033 --> 01:28:22,193
and see if anything
catches my eye from above?

2223
01:28:22,193 --> 01:28:24,434
MATT: Sure, you can
jump up on the carpet

2224
01:28:24,467 --> 01:28:25,901
and get an aerial view.

2225
01:28:25,934 --> 01:28:27,634
And as you get up towards the
top if the cavern, look over.

2226
01:28:27,667 --> 01:28:28,901
LAURA: Not that I couldn't have
done that on my broom,

2227
01:28:28,934 --> 01:28:30,133
but I feel a little safer

2228
01:28:30,167 --> 01:28:32,334
'cause there's
stuff all around me.

2229
01:28:32,367 --> 01:28:34,901
MATT: Yeah, it's a nice big
square patch just for you.

2230
01:28:34,934 --> 01:28:36,234
LAURA: I'm gonna lay down and...

2231
01:28:36,267 --> 01:28:38,067
LIAM: Is there room for
your broom on your carpet?

2232
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:39,534
LAURA: Yes.

2233
01:28:39,567 --> 01:28:41,567
TALIESIN: I'm gonna run on up there

2234
01:28:41,601 --> 01:28:44,588
and get a vantage point 'cause
I still have some spider walk--

2235
01:28:44,588 --> 01:28:45,701
MATT: You do, yeah.

2236
01:28:45,734 --> 01:28:47,467
LAURA: Hop on over, Perc.

2237
01:28:47,501 --> 01:28:50,234
MATT: So you watch as Percy
kind of walks upside down

2238
01:28:50,267 --> 01:28:52,701
from on the cavern
and kind of gets

2239
01:28:52,734 --> 01:28:54,200
a similar perspective as you.

2240
01:28:54,234 --> 01:28:57,634
Make an
investigation check.

2241
01:29:00,287 --> 01:29:02,067
-SAM: Not great.

2242
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:03,501
-MARISHA: That's real bad.
-TALIESIN: I can't pretend,

2243
01:29:03,534 --> 01:29:05,634
-I can't pretend that that's--
-SAM: Real, real bad.

2244
01:29:05,667 --> 01:29:07,634
MARISHA: That's pretty bad.

2245
01:29:07,667 --> 01:29:09,534
TALIESIN: Why am I even bothering?

2246
01:29:09,567 --> 01:29:10,667
Six.

2247
01:29:10,701 --> 01:29:13,467
MATT: Yeah. In all the
time you spent here,

2248
01:29:13,501 --> 01:29:17,701
most anything that catches
your eye beyond just value,

2249
01:29:17,734 --> 01:29:21,601
you've managed to scavenge
and glean from the horde.

2250
01:29:21,634 --> 01:29:25,601
Everything else seems
to be just collections

2251
01:29:25,634 --> 01:29:30,601
of expensive or
valuable knick-knacks,

2252
01:29:30,634 --> 01:29:33,300
collectibles, museum pieces.

2253
01:29:33,334 --> 01:29:39,400
You know, silverware,
furniture, art pieces.

2254
01:29:39,434 --> 01:29:42,634
Gem collections, and
then gold, silver, platinum.

2255
01:29:42,667 --> 01:29:48,400
It's...you knowing
good amounts of money,

2256
01:29:48,434 --> 01:29:52,200
you can't even
fathom the scope of this.

2257
01:29:52,234 --> 01:29:53,394
Like this is...

2258
01:29:55,367 --> 01:29:57,801
TRAVIS: Vex, you're drooling.

2259
01:29:57,834 --> 01:30:00,544
MATT: Like millions of gold pieces.

2260
01:30:00,544 --> 01:30:01,904
LAURA: That's a lot.

2261
01:30:01,904 --> 01:30:04,067
TRAVIS: I feel like this
is too much for anyone--

2262
01:30:04,067 --> 01:30:05,634
LAURA: No, no, no, it is.

2263
01:30:05,667 --> 01:30:07,467
We need to return this
to the people of Emon,

2264
01:30:07,501 --> 01:30:09,067
I mean, that's who
this money came from.

2265
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:10,534
TRAVIS: Yeah, but how do we do that?

2266
01:30:10,567 --> 01:30:12,457
-LAURA: Yeah?
-MARISHA: Do you see anything

2267
01:30:12,457 --> 01:30:13,834
from Greyskull in there?

2268
01:30:13,868 --> 01:30:16,868
LAURA: Oh, do I see
anything from our keep?

2269
01:30:16,901 --> 01:30:20,167
MATT: Nothing that stands out
or you would recognize.

2270
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:21,734
LAURA: Not that I can see.

2271
01:30:21,767 --> 01:30:23,801
MARISHA: All right.

2272
01:30:23,834 --> 01:30:26,884
TALIESIN: Now we'll, we'll take
a tithing for ourselves

2273
01:30:26,884 --> 01:30:29,133
to help rebuild and then
everything we're gonna

2274
01:30:29,167 --> 01:30:33,534
have to post guards and someone
is gonna have to take charge

2275
01:30:33,567 --> 01:30:36,271
of all this, put it to a use
rebuilding the city,

2276
01:30:36,271 --> 01:30:39,167
make sure that the antiquities
get back to the proper owners

2277
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:41,704
and that the money is used
to just rebuild everything.

2278
01:30:41,704 --> 01:30:44,360
LAURA: People will have to put in
papers with the counsel.

2279
01:30:44,360 --> 01:30:46,817
MARISHA: I was gonna say people
are gonna have to pull papers.

2280
01:30:46,817 --> 01:30:48,700
TALIESIN: I think they're probably not
gonna get their money back,

2281
01:30:48,700 --> 01:30:50,398
but they're at least
gonna get their--

2282
01:30:50,398 --> 01:30:51,701
LAURA: Something.

2283
01:30:51,734 --> 01:30:53,290
TRAVIS: Should we reward Kerr?

2284
01:30:53,290 --> 01:30:54,934
Kerr, do you want
some of this bling?

2285
01:30:54,968 --> 01:30:57,367
PATRICK: Actually Kerr, after
you're okay and kind of

2286
01:30:57,400 --> 01:30:59,067
up and about yourself,

2287
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:03,167
probably very casually
like kind of wanders around

2288
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:07,000
and like when he gets
to the jewelry and the gems,

2289
01:31:07,033 --> 01:31:10,467
like very matter
of factly fills up a sack.

2290
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:13,667
MARISHA: Very matter of factly.

2291
01:31:13,701 --> 01:31:15,334
PATRICK: You know like, no like,

2292
01:31:15,367 --> 01:31:18,100
ooh, I'm a---I feel a little
awkward about this,

2293
01:31:18,133 --> 01:31:23,701
just like, like this is really
not my first rodeo and money.

2294
01:31:23,734 --> 01:31:25,434
And money,
money does some--

2295
01:31:25,467 --> 01:31:27,033
this is more
than they can carry.

2296
01:31:27,067 --> 01:31:30,400
And, um, I have some
uses for this money.

2297
01:31:30,434 --> 01:31:31,734
MATT: Yeah.

2298
01:31:31,767 --> 01:31:34,000
LAURA: I did give
20 pounds of gems

2299
01:31:34,033 --> 01:31:35,901
when we were down
in the city of Brass,

2300
01:31:35,934 --> 01:31:37,501
maybe I can find
some more gems.

2301
01:31:37,534 --> 01:31:38,634
MATT: Okay, yeah.

2302
01:31:38,667 --> 01:31:41,234
TALIESIN: No, this is, we are
taking our tithing.

2303
01:31:41,267 --> 01:31:43,713
You know taking it, we have work
that needs to be done.

2304
01:31:43,713 --> 01:31:45,300
MATT: How much are you taking?

2305
01:31:45,334 --> 01:31:47,167
I mean, it's your choice
really at this point.

2306
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:48,463
How much do you want to

2307
01:31:48,463 --> 01:31:50,133
and how much can you carry?

2308
01:31:50,167 --> 01:31:51,667
Do you feel
comfortable doing?

2309
01:31:51,701 --> 01:31:55,377
LAURA: We do have a lot of, we do
have a lot of money right now.

2310
01:31:55,377 --> 01:31:57,300
TALIESIN: We're going to be rebuilding.

2311
01:31:57,334 --> 01:31:59,100
We need gems and platinum.

2312
01:31:59,133 --> 01:32:01,677
Let's not take anything that
isn't gems and platinum

2313
01:32:01,677 --> 01:32:03,667
and let's not
take a ton of it.

2314
01:32:03,701 --> 01:32:05,614
TRAVIS: What about like big
diamonds or rubies

2315
01:32:05,614 --> 01:32:07,334
for like important
spells and stuff?

2316
01:32:07,367 --> 01:32:09,300
TALIESIN: A few of those
would be good.

2317
01:32:09,334 --> 01:32:12,367
MARISHA: Gems, yeah--gems for
heroes feasts are always good.

2318
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:13,667
LAURA: Oh yeah, smart, smart.

2319
01:32:13,701 --> 01:32:15,501
TALIESIN: We did burn a bunch
of them for this.

2320
01:32:15,534 --> 01:32:17,133
LAURA: Smart, Grog.

2321
01:32:17,167 --> 01:32:19,354
TRAVIS: I pass out
from the smartness.

2322
01:32:19,354 --> 01:32:22,033
(laughing)

2323
01:32:22,067 --> 01:32:24,874
MATT: As Grog falls asleep
cuddling with the gold coins.

2324
01:32:24,874 --> 01:32:28,067
Like a slow rolling
Scrooge McDuck.

2325
01:32:28,100 --> 01:32:30,200
(yawn)

2326
01:32:30,234 --> 01:32:33,033
Vex, you do find--with
eight of your friends, too--

2327
01:32:33,067 --> 01:32:35,634
there are two diamonds roughly
worth about 1,000 gold pieces

2328
01:32:35,667 --> 01:32:38,567
that you can put off
to the side as component.

2329
01:32:38,601 --> 01:32:41,507
You do find gems,
but really I mean,

2330
01:32:41,507 --> 01:32:43,438
how much do you
want to take, really?

2331
01:32:43,438 --> 01:32:44,937
This isn't how
much did you find,

2332
01:32:44,937 --> 01:32:46,341
there's enough
here to take

2333
01:32:46,341 --> 01:32:48,267
pretty much anything
you can carry.

2334
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:51,033
There's no way you can carry
even but a fraction of this,

2335
01:32:51,067 --> 01:32:53,667
so, what do you want to take?

2336
01:32:53,701 --> 01:32:55,267
SAM: Platinum is worth ten gold?

2337
01:32:55,300 --> 01:32:57,701
LAURA: Yeah, so like we have--

2338
01:32:57,734 --> 01:32:59,567
SAM: I'm taking
200 platinum for myself.

2339
01:32:59,601 --> 01:33:01,340
MATT: Okay.

2340
01:33:01,340 --> 01:33:03,271
TALIESIN: I think I would
actually honestly say

2341
01:33:03,271 --> 01:33:04,917
at least 1,000
platinum in general

2342
01:33:04,917 --> 01:33:06,868
just for general
use for the group.

2343
01:33:06,901 --> 01:33:08,283
-MARISHA: Yeah.
-LAURA: Yeah.

2344
01:33:08,283 --> 01:33:10,467
TALIESIN: And then ten of each
gem that we can find.

2345
01:33:10,501 --> 01:33:13,701
LAURA: 1,000 platinum
for the group then?

2346
01:33:13,734 --> 01:33:14,987
-MATT: Sure.
-LAURA: Okay.

2347
01:33:14,987 --> 01:33:16,474
TALIESIN: That seems reasonable.

2348
01:33:16,474 --> 01:33:17,667
LAURA: Yeah, totally.

2349
01:33:17,701 --> 01:33:21,324
TALIESIN: We're also gonna need to put
somebody in charge of all this.

2350
01:33:21,324 --> 01:33:23,934
MARISHA: Yes, someone trustworthy.

2351
01:33:23,968 --> 01:33:25,767
PATRICK: (snoring)

2352
01:33:25,801 --> 01:33:27,267
(laughing)

2353
01:33:27,300 --> 01:33:29,534
TALIESIN: Oh, we know you have
things to do.

2354
01:33:29,567 --> 01:33:30,941
TRAVIS: The guilt of it.

2355
01:33:30,941 --> 01:33:33,367
(laughing)

2356
01:33:35,133 --> 01:33:38,234
MARISHA: I see Kerr hesitate,
and I bend down

2357
01:33:38,267 --> 01:33:41,968
and I pick up like
a handful of gold and say...

2358
01:33:45,357 --> 01:33:47,901
PATRICK: No, it's more like,
it's like am I gonna

2359
01:33:47,934 --> 01:33:49,567
be in charge of another city?

2360
01:33:49,601 --> 01:33:52,400
LAURA: No, no, no, not
unless you want to be.

2361
01:33:52,434 --> 01:33:57,200
PATRICK: It's, uh, but no, I grab mostly
not big gems, nothing flashy,

2362
01:33:57,234 --> 01:34:00,367
but light, portable,
and stuff that

2363
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:02,367
can be converted into cash.

2364
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:04,901
Like, I've got troops
who are going to--

2365
01:34:04,934 --> 01:34:08,067
and a city back home, yeah.

2366
01:34:08,100 --> 01:34:11,634
TALIESIN: And you did come here, so.

2367
01:34:11,667 --> 01:34:15,707
SAM: Vex, there are six,
there are seven of us.

2368
01:34:17,701 --> 01:34:19,734
Maybe we should
take a bit more.

2369
01:34:19,767 --> 01:34:21,367
MARISHA: I'm taking a little bit
of gold for myself

2370
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:23,300
just 'cause I'm low.

2371
01:34:23,334 --> 01:34:26,824
LAURA: Yeah, if you guys want
to grab stuff yourself.

2372
01:34:26,824 --> 01:34:29,167
MATT: Kima's abstained, by the way.

2373
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:31,634
Kima's not taking anything.

2374
01:34:31,667 --> 01:34:34,033
While Gilmore is currently
filling up a small satchel,

2375
01:34:34,067 --> 01:34:38,834
he's like, "Well, I have
to rebuild some way."

2376
01:34:38,868 --> 01:34:41,734
Shoveling in small amounts,
but you know, not too much.

2377
01:34:41,767 --> 01:34:43,294
LAURA: Same.

2378
01:34:44,868 --> 01:34:49,968
I'll take...so hard.

2379
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,811
TRAVIS: I'm taking 184 gold pieces.

2380
01:34:52,811 --> 01:34:54,057
MATT: Good job, Grog.

2381
01:34:54,057 --> 01:34:55,467
LAURA: Nice, Grog.

2382
01:34:55,501 --> 01:34:57,000
(laughing)

2383
01:34:57,033 --> 01:34:59,727
TALIESIN: I'm just gonna
put 500 gold pieces.

2384
01:34:59,727 --> 01:35:01,290
SAM: Dude, that's
a million dollars.

2385
01:35:01,290 --> 01:35:02,600
MARISHA: That's what I did
with 500.

2386
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:03,801
TALIESIN: 500 gold pieces.

2387
01:35:03,834 --> 01:35:04,868
TRAVIS: Like candy or something.

2388
01:35:04,901 --> 01:35:06,334
Jellybeans in a jar.

2389
01:35:06,367 --> 01:35:09,467
LAURA: Fifty platinum,
so it's lighter.

2390
01:35:09,501 --> 01:35:14,534
TALIESIN: We're going to have
to seal this cave for now.

2391
01:35:16,634 --> 01:35:18,767
SAM: Why, the city is secured.

2392
01:35:18,801 --> 01:35:21,501
TALIESIN: The city is secured, the
city is about to become a riot

2393
01:35:21,534 --> 01:35:22,767
once they finish getting

2394
01:35:22,801 --> 01:35:24,914
-everything out of here.
-LAURA: And looters will come down here

2395
01:35:24,914 --> 01:35:26,307
and take far
more than we did.

2396
01:35:26,307 --> 01:35:27,434
TRAVIS: No, really?

2397
01:35:27,467 --> 01:35:29,467
SAM: Wait a second.

2398
01:35:29,501 --> 01:35:31,634
Don't we owe The
Clasp half of this?

2399
01:35:31,667 --> 01:35:35,567
LAURA: We owe The Clasp
half of our loot.

2400
01:35:35,601 --> 01:35:37,000
SAM: What does that mean?

2401
01:35:37,033 --> 01:35:40,434
MARISHA: But that's our loot,
that's not the city's.

2402
01:35:40,467 --> 01:35:45,367
LAURA: If we don't take as much,
then we don't give them as much.

2403
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:47,834
SAM: I don't think they
would view it that way.

2404
01:35:47,868 --> 01:35:49,790
TALIESIN: That's the deal they made.

2405
01:35:49,790 --> 01:35:52,734
This is not our loot
we just looted.

2406
01:35:52,767 --> 01:35:56,434
LAURA: It's not our money,
it's Emon's.

2407
01:35:56,467 --> 01:35:58,367
MARISHA: The Clasp should
be aware of that.

2408
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:00,281
SAM: I think we're going
to make an enemy

2409
01:36:00,281 --> 01:36:01,501
out of them by doing this.

2410
01:36:01,534 --> 01:36:03,827
TALIESIN: I think we're going to
keep an enemy out of them

2411
01:36:03,827 --> 01:36:04,968
is really more likely.

2412
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,067
LAURA: How do we even
know who we told?

2413
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:08,334
It could have
been two underlings,

2414
01:36:08,367 --> 01:36:09,834
nobody would believe
what they said anyway.

2415
01:36:09,868 --> 01:36:12,167
TRAVIS: Sure would be a gesture in
the right direction, though.

2416
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:14,167
MARISHA: Well we can, I'm sure
we can still throw them

2417
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:16,501
a little bit
of platinum, but...

2418
01:36:16,534 --> 01:36:17,767
I mean, Percy--

2419
01:36:17,801 --> 01:36:19,267
SAM: What like 5,000,
is that what you're saying,

2420
01:36:19,300 --> 01:36:21,400
half of, half
of what we take?

2421
01:36:21,434 --> 01:36:23,133
How does this work?

2422
01:36:23,167 --> 01:36:25,701
That's nothing to them.

2423
01:36:25,734 --> 01:36:27,267
We promised them
untold riches.

2424
01:36:27,300 --> 01:36:29,200
LAURA: We took 1,000 platinum
for ourselves.

2425
01:36:29,234 --> 01:36:31,567
If we took another 1,000
and gave it to The Clasp,

2426
01:36:31,601 --> 01:36:32,734
that's a lot of money.

2427
01:36:32,767 --> 01:36:34,200
TRAVIS: How about we don't
give them anything

2428
01:36:34,234 --> 01:36:36,200
and we just let them know
it's clear to come down here

2429
01:36:36,234 --> 01:36:37,667
and deal with it as they will.

2430
01:36:37,701 --> 01:36:39,100
SAM: They'll take everything.

2431
01:36:39,133 --> 01:36:41,167
TALIESIN: I don't know if they'll
take everything, actually.

2432
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:44,534
MARISHA: Well, Percy, you once
said that every good city

2433
01:36:44,567 --> 01:36:46,067
needs a good underbelly.

2434
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:47,634
TALIESIN: That's true.

2435
01:36:47,667 --> 01:36:50,167
MARISHA: I imagine that
the underbelly would also

2436
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:52,968
have a vested interest
in a having good city,

2437
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,434
I imagine it
works both ways, right?

2438
01:36:54,467 --> 01:36:55,968
TALIESIN: I'm so proud
of you right now.

2439
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,267
MARISHA: Yeah, thank you.

2440
01:36:57,300 --> 01:36:58,501
TALIESIN: Oh my God.

2441
01:36:58,534 --> 01:37:00,100
MARISHA: I'm learning from you,
just like a little,

2442
01:37:00,133 --> 01:37:01,534
-where it's appropriate.
-TALIESIN: I'm so sorry,

2443
01:37:01,567 --> 01:37:03,000
-but I'm so proud.
-MARISHA: Only where it's appropriate.

2444
01:37:03,033 --> 01:37:04,267
TRAVIS: So what is it,
we hand deliver it

2445
01:37:04,300 --> 01:37:05,868
or we just let them know
it's clear to come down?

2446
01:37:05,901 --> 01:37:08,701
SAM: Hand deliver, we don't want
them coming here at all.

2447
01:37:08,734 --> 01:37:10,033
TRAVIS: I agree, it's more personal.

2448
01:37:10,067 --> 01:37:13,000
You write the limerick and
we give them two platinum.

2449
01:37:13,033 --> 01:37:14,367
(laughing)

2450
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:15,901
What was the number you said?

2451
01:37:15,934 --> 01:37:18,334
LAURA: That two is what I said, yes.

2452
01:37:18,367 --> 01:37:22,067
PATRICK: Send them an envelope
with half of the deck in it.

2453
01:37:22,100 --> 01:37:24,537
(gasps)

2454
01:37:24,537 --> 01:37:26,667
TRAVIS: It just turns into swords--

2455
01:37:26,701 --> 01:37:29,501
TALIESIN: How are you the cruelest
human I've ever--oh, my.

2456
01:37:29,534 --> 01:37:30,601
That's amazing.

2457
01:37:30,634 --> 01:37:32,890
LAURA: I don't know what
the deck can do.

2458
01:37:32,890 --> 01:37:36,968
Could it, could it cause
the entire city to crumble?

2459
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,300
Potentially?

2460
01:37:42,267 --> 01:37:43,367
Ooh.

2461
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:44,434
PATRICK: That, I do not know.

2462
01:37:44,467 --> 01:37:45,787
TALIESIN: We can give them the deck.

2463
01:37:45,787 --> 01:37:46,934
LIAM: Vax just woke up.

2464
01:37:46,968 --> 01:37:49,400
MATT: Hi, Vax, welcome back.

2465
01:37:49,434 --> 01:37:51,567
TRAVIS: So, what, five
thousand platinum?

2466
01:37:51,601 --> 01:37:53,000
SAM: Five thousand platinum.

2467
01:37:53,033 --> 01:37:55,234
LAURA: Why five tho--where are you
coming up with these numbers?

2468
01:37:55,267 --> 01:37:58,234
MARISHA: You literally said
different numbers every time.

2469
01:37:58,267 --> 01:38:00,501
TRAVIS: We could give them like
three pizza platinum,

2470
01:38:00,534 --> 01:38:01,767
it doesn't
really matter to me,

2471
01:38:01,801 --> 01:38:03,100
I just want to go.

2472
01:38:03,133 --> 01:38:04,300
-LIAM: Hey, big man?
-TRAVIS: Yeah.

2473
01:38:04,334 --> 01:38:05,634
LIAM: That's a nice sword,
where did you get that?

2474
01:38:05,667 --> 01:38:07,911
TRAVIS: I took out a card
of this little pouch

2475
01:38:07,911 --> 01:38:09,643
and it turned into this thing.

2476
01:38:09,643 --> 01:38:11,367
LIAM: What are you talking about?

2477
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:13,850
TRAVIS: Yeah, it was like a little card
in like a leather pouch

2478
01:38:13,850 --> 01:38:15,431
and then Vex took it from me

2479
01:38:15,431 --> 01:38:18,367
'cause apparently
I make too many weapons.

2480
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:21,400
SAM: If we want them
to be our allies,

2481
01:38:21,434 --> 01:38:23,667
and not hate us
and try to kill us,

2482
01:38:23,701 --> 01:38:26,701
we have to give them
a good amount of money.

2483
01:38:26,734 --> 01:38:27,901
LIAM: What, The Clasp?

2484
01:38:27,934 --> 01:38:28,801
SAM: Yes.

2485
01:38:28,834 --> 01:38:30,300
LIAM: We're talking about payment.

2486
01:38:30,334 --> 01:38:33,334
LAURA: We give them 1,000 platinum and
say that's half of what we took.

2487
01:38:33,367 --> 01:38:35,934
LIAM: Oh, they're a crime syndicate,
they're gonna laugh at that.

2488
01:38:35,968 --> 01:38:37,367
SAM: I agree.

2489
01:38:37,400 --> 01:38:41,567
PATRICK: And they know when someone's
running a game on them.

2490
01:38:41,601 --> 01:38:44,167
LAURA: But we didn't take any more,
that's our loot.

2491
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:46,634
SAM: That's not how
they're gonna see this.

2492
01:38:46,667 --> 01:38:48,547
LIAM: That's a letter
of the law argument,

2493
01:38:48,547 --> 01:38:50,334
they're gonna want
to go spirit.

2494
01:38:50,367 --> 01:38:55,317
MARISHA: We also just saved their
city from utter destruction.

2495
01:38:55,317 --> 01:38:57,501
TRAVIS: Honestly, are we
gonna stay around

2496
01:38:57,534 --> 01:39:00,234
and really regulate what happens
here, we're not, right?

2497
01:39:00,267 --> 01:39:01,467
We've got shit to do.

2498
01:39:01,501 --> 01:39:02,968
TALIESIN: I would honestly say,

2499
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,901
and I cannot believe
that I'm agreeing to this,

2500
01:39:05,934 --> 01:39:07,601
but I think just
if we run into them,

2501
01:39:07,634 --> 01:39:09,737
we let them know
that the dragon's dead

2502
01:39:09,737 --> 01:39:11,801
and that's where it is.

2503
01:39:11,834 --> 01:39:13,567
TRAVIS: I'm with Percy.

2504
01:39:13,601 --> 01:39:15,000
TALIESIN: They're not gonna
bankrupt the city,

2505
01:39:15,033 --> 01:39:16,701
it's not in
their best interests.

2506
01:39:16,734 --> 01:39:17,934
They're gonna
take a look at it

2507
01:39:17,968 --> 01:39:20,000
and they're gonna get
what they can carry.

2508
01:39:22,367 --> 01:39:25,000
SAM: So we're turning over the city
and the city's treasury

2509
01:39:25,033 --> 01:39:26,467
to a bunch of thieves.

2510
01:39:26,501 --> 01:39:28,434
TALIESIN: We turned over the city
to a bunch of thieves,

2511
01:39:28,467 --> 01:39:29,901
they've basically
been running the place

2512
01:39:29,934 --> 01:39:32,534
for the past few months.

2513
01:39:32,567 --> 01:39:34,200
PATRICK: How small town am I?

2514
01:39:34,234 --> 01:39:35,787
Do I know about these folks?

2515
01:39:35,787 --> 01:39:38,133
MATT: You've never dealt
with them directly

2516
01:39:38,167 --> 01:39:42,534
other than scaring off a
couple of younger cutthroats

2517
01:39:42,567 --> 01:39:44,701
you caught in like
an alleyway here or there.

2518
01:39:44,734 --> 01:39:46,491
But you're aware of The Clasp.

2519
01:39:46,491 --> 01:39:48,868
The Clasp, while
largely centered in Emon,

2520
01:39:48,901 --> 01:39:51,567
is a syndicate that is
across all Tal'Dorei

2521
01:39:51,601 --> 01:39:54,434
and has some hand in every
village no matter how small.

2522
01:39:54,467 --> 01:39:56,400
PATRICK: Right.

2523
01:39:56,434 --> 01:39:58,434
LAURA: Maybe we let them
know that it's there,

2524
01:39:58,467 --> 01:40:00,000
but that the
guards are coming.

2525
01:40:00,033 --> 01:40:01,334
They won't have
a lot of time.

2526
01:40:01,367 --> 01:40:04,634
MARISHA: Why don't we just hand
this over to someone else

2527
01:40:04,667 --> 01:40:06,000
and let them handle it?

2528
01:40:06,033 --> 01:40:08,601
PATRICK: If you hand it
over to someone else,

2529
01:40:08,601 --> 01:40:11,567
and send them a letter, it
will take a while to get there.

2530
01:40:11,601 --> 01:40:13,267
SAM: The Clasp?

2531
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:15,887
They're down the hallway.

2532
01:40:15,887 --> 01:40:16,968
PATRICK: Which one?

2533
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:18,534
TRAVIS: Over yonder.

2534
01:40:18,567 --> 01:40:20,968
SAM: They're in the sewers
1,000 meters from here.

2535
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,834
PATRICK: Oh.

2536
01:40:24,847 --> 01:40:26,868
MARISHA: Regardless,
I agree with Grog.

2537
01:40:26,901 --> 01:40:30,200
We have more important things
to worry about right now.

2538
01:40:30,234 --> 01:40:31,910
TRAVIS: I'm running for office.

2539
01:40:31,910 --> 01:40:34,701
SAM: T-shirt: Regardless,
I agree with Grog.

2540
01:40:34,734 --> 01:40:37,968
(laughing)

2541
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:43,567
MARISHA: Things never
been said before.

2542
01:40:43,601 --> 01:40:46,033
PATRICK: Is there any of
the people collected,

2543
01:40:46,067 --> 01:40:47,601
the generals or whatever,

2544
01:40:47,634 --> 01:40:49,934
have you worked
with them as well?

2545
01:40:49,968 --> 01:40:51,000
LAURA: The Clasp or the--

2546
01:40:51,033 --> 01:40:55,033
PATRICK: No, the former
leaders of this city,

2547
01:40:55,067 --> 01:40:56,868
any of the people
that you've--

2548
01:40:56,901 --> 01:40:59,100
SAM: The military, we can put
them in charge of this.

2549
01:40:59,133 --> 01:41:01,534
TALIESIN: There's not
really any military.

2550
01:41:01,567 --> 01:41:03,534
SAM: There's a visiting army.

2551
01:41:03,567 --> 01:41:04,834
Yeah, we can put
them in charge of it,

2552
01:41:04,868 --> 01:41:06,167
at least temporarily.

2553
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:07,367
They can be trusted.

2554
01:41:07,400 --> 01:41:08,467
TALIESIN: Can they?

2555
01:41:08,501 --> 01:41:12,567
LIAM: Kima, do you feel
like keeping an eye

2556
01:41:12,601 --> 01:41:17,133
on a small group of
soldiers from Syngorn?

2557
01:41:17,167 --> 01:41:18,387
Protecting this?

2558
01:41:18,387 --> 01:41:19,670
A few days?

2559
01:41:19,670 --> 01:41:22,334
MATT: "I could probably run it,
I'd probably have to go

2560
01:41:22,367 --> 01:41:23,767
and check in with Allie.

2561
01:41:23,801 --> 01:41:26,227
I'm sure she'd be interested
in knowing about this

2562
01:41:26,227 --> 01:41:28,033
since she's, you know,
part of the council."

2563
01:41:28,067 --> 01:41:29,467
LAURA: Right, we need to tell her.

2564
01:41:29,501 --> 01:41:33,767
MATT: "We have Asum--I mean
we still have a number

2565
01:41:33,801 --> 01:41:35,367
of standing council members

2566
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:37,200
and there's a few we still
haven't accounted for."

2567
01:41:37,234 --> 01:41:38,067
LIAM: This is your home.

2568
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:39,200
TALIESIN: That would be better.

2569
01:41:39,234 --> 01:41:41,430
MATT: "My home is Westruun,
to be honest,

2570
01:41:41,430 --> 01:41:44,467
but I've kind of taken
this as a second home."

2571
01:41:44,501 --> 01:41:47,734
TALIESIN: Far more stories of treasures
being looted by foreigners.

2572
01:41:47,767 --> 01:41:50,667
LAURA: Honestly, we need to get to
Whitestone, speaking of.

2573
01:41:50,701 --> 01:41:53,138
TRAVIS: Yeah, don't we need
to like get a hand

2574
01:41:53,138 --> 01:41:55,567
and plant it under a tree
or something like that?

2575
01:41:55,601 --> 01:41:57,501
LAURA: Yes.

2576
01:41:57,534 --> 01:41:58,220
Yes.

2577
01:41:58,220 --> 01:41:59,530
SAM: Forgot about that.

2578
01:41:59,530 --> 01:42:00,767
TALIESIN: We have a hand.

2579
01:42:00,801 --> 01:42:02,104
MARISHA: We have a hand.

2580
01:42:02,104 --> 01:42:03,934
LAURA: We have ashes to
bury in Vasselheim.

2581
01:42:03,968 --> 01:42:05,167
MARISHA: We have a lot to do.

2582
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:06,868
LAURA: We have to find out
where the fuck Raishan is.

2583
01:42:06,901 --> 01:42:08,834
Can we see if maybe
she went to Whitestone

2584
01:42:08,868 --> 01:42:10,634
and the whole city's decimated?

2585
01:42:10,667 --> 01:42:14,000
MARISHA: I can try and scry
with the scrying eye,

2586
01:42:14,033 --> 01:42:16,033
but that's it.

2587
01:42:16,067 --> 01:42:18,351
TRAVIS: How about we go to
Whitestone and then scry?

2588
01:42:18,351 --> 01:42:20,767
SAM: Well, we won't need
to if we're there.

2589
01:42:20,801 --> 01:42:22,167
MARISHA: Yeah.

2590
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:23,968
LAURA: Just find out
if it's all right.

2591
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,743
TALIESIN: Let's crawl upstairs.

2592
01:42:25,743 --> 01:42:28,100
Let's keep some
people on this, Kima,

2593
01:42:28,133 --> 01:42:29,968
and we'll crawl upstairs.

2594
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,334
MARISHA: I can try to scry on Rai--

2595
01:42:31,367 --> 01:42:35,367
Did I find a little, like a
scale of hers, by the way?

2596
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:37,901
MATT: Glancing about, uh...
roll an investigation check

2597
01:42:37,934 --> 01:42:39,434
specifically
looking for the scale.

2598
01:42:39,467 --> 01:42:41,734
As opposed to looking for
other things about the room.

2599
01:42:41,767 --> 01:42:44,701
TALIESIN: That's crock, that's--
yeah, I know.

2600
01:42:44,734 --> 01:42:46,100
MARISHA: That's slightly better.

2601
01:42:46,133 --> 01:42:47,934
Uh, ten total.

2602
01:42:47,968 --> 01:42:51,734
MATT: Ten total? It takes
you about ten minutes

2603
01:42:51,767 --> 01:42:56,667
and because the
shifting low light in here

2604
01:42:56,701 --> 01:43:00,300
the rocky formations
of the ground itself,

2605
01:43:00,334 --> 01:43:04,467
you're having a hard time
finding any scales of Raishan's.

2606
01:43:04,501 --> 01:43:06,834
MARISHA: Anything, blood?

2607
01:43:06,868 --> 01:43:08,901
MATT: It takes you about
15 or 20 minutes

2608
01:43:08,934 --> 01:43:11,334
before you actually
find a small cluster.

2609
01:43:11,367 --> 01:43:15,400
From one of the wounds
left behind by Grog.

2610
01:43:15,434 --> 01:43:17,100
MARISHA: Yeah, that'll do it, yeah.

2611
01:43:17,133 --> 01:43:19,400
TALIESIN: I'm gonna
grab the bag of colding

2612
01:43:19,434 --> 01:43:23,267
and take samples of the
dragon eggs that we cracked,

2613
01:43:23,300 --> 01:43:28,447
the fluid, the bodies, like I'll
put the whole thing in there.

2614
01:43:30,601 --> 01:43:32,200
We need that.

2615
01:43:32,234 --> 01:43:34,234
PATRICK: They intend?

2616
01:43:34,267 --> 01:43:38,267
-They took the body--
-LAURA: Raishan?

2617
01:43:38,300 --> 01:43:44,100
LIAM: She, uh, no, no, she's been
playing us for a long time.

2618
01:43:44,133 --> 01:43:47,033
We were in a loose
agreement with her

2619
01:43:47,067 --> 01:43:49,701
to get to today
and we've never felt

2620
01:43:49,734 --> 01:43:52,834
like she's told us
the whole picture.

2621
01:43:52,868 --> 01:43:56,434
Uh, we have watched her
gas scores of people

2622
01:43:56,467 --> 01:43:58,601
in front of us.

2623
01:43:58,634 --> 01:44:03,200
She's killed many
of your friends.

2624
01:44:03,234 --> 01:44:04,667
She's not good.

2625
01:44:04,701 --> 01:44:09,634
But no, we don't ultimately
know what her next move is.

2626
01:44:09,667 --> 01:44:13,501
MARISHA: I can try to scry on her
and maybe get lucky

2627
01:44:13,534 --> 01:44:16,901
or I can try and
scry on Whitestone.

2628
01:44:16,934 --> 01:44:19,033
The problem is
is she's smart,

2629
01:44:19,067 --> 01:44:20,434
so even if I try
and scry on her,

2630
01:44:20,467 --> 01:44:22,767
there's a possibility
that she'll resist it.

2631
01:44:22,801 --> 01:44:26,667
TALIESIN: She's exhausted still,
I would assume.

2632
01:44:26,701 --> 01:44:28,714
MARISHA: She did burn all of her
legendary resistance,

2633
01:44:28,714 --> 01:44:30,534
-didn't she?
-MATT: She did.

2634
01:44:30,567 --> 01:44:33,033
TALIESIN: And she's
probably been running.

2635
01:44:33,067 --> 01:44:34,267
LIAM: What could it hurt?

2636
01:44:34,300 --> 01:44:36,334
MARISHA: I'm gonna try
and scry on Raishan.

2637
01:44:36,367 --> 01:44:37,968
MATT: Okay, casting the spell?

2638
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:39,267
MARISHA: Scrying eye.

2639
01:44:39,300 --> 01:44:41,501
MATT: Scrying eye, okay the reason,
the item's DC,

2640
01:44:41,534 --> 01:44:42,767
not your spell DC.

2641
01:44:42,801 --> 01:44:44,567
MARISHA: I guess so, but I
don't know if you ever put

2642
01:44:44,601 --> 01:44:50,801
the scrying eye DC on here,
it doesn't have a DC.

2643
01:44:50,834 --> 01:44:54,367
MATT: It doesn't--then, uh, then
we'll use your spell DC,

2644
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:57,000
that's fine, okay, so.

2645
01:44:57,033 --> 01:44:59,501
So as you guys
begin situating,

2646
01:44:59,534 --> 01:45:02,901
Kima walks up at the surface.

2647
01:45:02,934 --> 01:45:05,234
Gilmore's still kind
of rummaging through

2648
01:45:05,267 --> 01:45:06,667
and trying to find some
interesting things.

2649
01:45:06,701 --> 01:45:09,400
And there's a few moments when
you hear Gilmore across from you

2650
01:45:09,434 --> 01:45:13,601
like, "Hah, hah,
this is mine."

2651
01:45:13,634 --> 01:45:16,100
Starting to find things left
over from his destroyed shop

2652
01:45:16,133 --> 01:45:17,367
that have been
scavenged by looters

2653
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:20,367
and brought back to
Thordak as, you know,

2654
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:23,501
paying homage to
their new ruler.

2655
01:45:23,534 --> 01:45:25,300
Um, Kima begins to head up

2656
01:45:25,334 --> 01:45:28,701
and you can hear now people
have begun to gather en masse

2657
01:45:28,734 --> 01:45:30,767
into the Cloudtop
it sounds like other--

2658
01:45:30,801 --> 01:45:33,801
the rest of your soldiers
along with Zahra and Kashaw

2659
01:45:33,834 --> 01:45:36,270
are walking up with her
and begin to organize

2660
01:45:36,270 --> 01:45:39,033
and find whoever's been
fighting through the city

2661
01:45:39,067 --> 01:45:43,467
and figuring out how to set up a
perimeter to defend the center

2662
01:45:43,501 --> 01:45:45,923
which essentially the entire
economy of the city

2663
01:45:45,923 --> 01:45:48,467
lies underground.

2664
01:45:48,501 --> 01:45:50,367
You begin to pull
out the scrying eye

2665
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:53,534
and set up the small
space for the ritual.

2666
01:45:53,567 --> 01:45:56,367
You concentrate on it and
kind of thrust your vision

2667
01:45:56,400 --> 01:45:59,934
towards the center
of the artifact.

2668
01:45:59,968 --> 01:46:01,701
What's the spell DC?

2669
01:46:01,734 --> 01:46:03,801
MARISHA: My spell save DC is 20.

2670
01:46:10,300 --> 01:46:13,067
MATT: All right.

2671
01:46:13,100 --> 01:46:18,901
So as you focus, you feel
your vision kind of lift up

2672
01:46:18,934 --> 01:46:22,200
into the dark clouds
as the storm is drifting

2673
01:46:22,234 --> 01:46:24,634
south--south east of the city

2674
01:46:24,667 --> 01:46:29,667
towards where the wyvern
riders have been escaping.

2675
01:46:29,701 --> 01:46:31,934
Into the clouds and the dark,
the moisture, the rain,

2676
01:46:31,968 --> 01:46:35,133
you feel the humidity
almost oppressive against you

2677
01:46:35,167 --> 01:46:38,567
and you feel your
essence being tugged,

2678
01:46:38,601 --> 01:46:40,497
being pulled rapidly
in a direction.

2679
01:46:40,497 --> 01:46:42,601
Amidst the cloud, you don't
know which direction it is,

2680
01:46:42,634 --> 01:46:43,701
but it's pulled you quickly

2681
01:46:43,734 --> 01:46:46,421
and suddenly you
emerge from the clouds

2682
01:46:46,421 --> 01:46:47,767
and you're over ocean.

2683
01:46:47,801 --> 01:46:50,567
Um, over ocean you
see in the distance

2684
01:46:50,601 --> 01:46:54,667
just open waves,
no signs of land, just water.

2685
01:46:54,701 --> 01:46:58,047
And then a singular island,
isolated, distant,

2686
01:46:58,047 --> 01:46:59,200
far from everything.

2687
01:46:59,234 --> 01:47:00,734
Your vision suddenly jumps,

2688
01:47:00,767 --> 01:47:03,434
scats upright to the outside
of this cavern opening.

2689
01:47:03,467 --> 01:47:07,234
You see--
skips, I meant to say.

2690
01:47:07,267 --> 01:47:09,567
Nothing escapes Laura's mind.

2691
01:47:09,601 --> 01:47:12,033
She is our
resident 13-year-old.

2692
01:47:12,067 --> 01:47:13,934
-LIAM: It was me that time.
-LAURA: It was actually him.

2693
01:47:13,968 --> 01:47:16,534
-It was him that time.
-MATT: You're twins, that's fine.

2694
01:47:16,567 --> 01:47:17,734
LIAM: Poopy.

2695
01:47:17,767 --> 01:47:19,067
MATT: Yes.

2696
01:47:19,100 --> 01:47:22,467
Skips ahead to the
exterior of some sort of

2697
01:47:22,501 --> 01:47:25,501
a mountain based cavern
that dips deep into the ground

2698
01:47:25,534 --> 01:47:29,968
in the center of this very,
very thick jungle-like terrain.

2699
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:34,067
You can see portions
of the cavern here

2700
01:47:34,100 --> 01:47:35,667
have been ruined
and broken down

2701
01:47:35,701 --> 01:47:41,234
and there appears to be some
sort of geothermal activity

2702
01:47:41,267 --> 01:47:42,267
in the vicinity.

2703
01:47:42,300 --> 01:47:44,834
Your vision skips again
and you can see

2704
01:47:44,868 --> 01:47:46,934
a deep series
of winding caverns

2705
01:47:46,968 --> 01:47:50,501
that lead to what
looks to be like a stone--

2706
01:47:50,534 --> 01:47:57,400
a very, very old
stone laboratory.

2707
01:47:57,434 --> 01:47:58,467
You see cages.

2708
01:47:58,501 --> 01:48:01,200
You see wooden furniture.

2709
01:48:01,234 --> 01:48:05,234
You see what look to
be portions of bookshelves

2710
01:48:05,267 --> 01:48:06,868
that are toppled over.

2711
01:48:06,901 --> 01:48:11,544
And out of the blurry peripheral
of this one focal point

2712
01:48:11,544 --> 01:48:13,400
where the spell
has taken you,

2713
01:48:13,434 --> 01:48:16,701
you can see what looks
to be just out of sight,

2714
01:48:16,734 --> 01:48:21,767
a large deep red crimson mass
that is just resting still.

2715
01:48:23,501 --> 01:48:27,267
You also see what appear to be
to your other peripheral,

2716
01:48:27,300 --> 01:48:33,801
two ovoid-like red shapes that
are kind of resting in the edge.

2717
01:48:33,834 --> 01:48:37,701
And there at one
of the bookshelves

2718
01:48:37,734 --> 01:48:42,400
you see a woman
with long dark green hair.

2719
01:48:42,434 --> 01:48:45,400
Um, wounded and bleeding.

2720
01:48:45,434 --> 01:48:49,367
Currently pulling books out
of the shelf and opening them

2721
01:48:49,400 --> 01:48:52,868
and looking through and slamming
it closed and throwing it down

2722
01:48:52,901 --> 01:48:55,534
and pulling another
book and going through.

take a restroom break

02:07:09,300 --> 02:07:13,234
word begins to spread
throughout the city that

every Fire Giant that
stood beneath Thordak

2754

in the city has been slain.

2755

A multitude of the lizardfolk
that were under Thordak

2756
02:07:24,434 --> 02:07:27,300
and the Conclaves barrier
have also been slain

or have fled the city.

2758
02:07:30,334 --> 02:07:33,434
The storm of the Ashari
has wandered and dissipated

2759
02:07:33,467 --> 02:07:36,801
as the immediate threat
of the wyvern riding horde

2760
02:07:36,834 --> 02:07:40,868
has fled towards the Stormcrest
Mountains to the Southeast,

02:07:48,601 --> 02:07:51,467
and putting them
under their care.

2765
02:07:51,501 --> 02:07:53,534
Members of the Clasp
have begun to rise up

2766
02:07:53,567 --> 02:07:57,367
and meet with the
remaining armies

2767
02:07:57,400 --> 02:08:00,701
in discussions of how to bring
most of the survivors out

2768
02:08:00,734 --> 02:08:03,501
as the Clasp has actually been--
as they discussed before--

2769
02:08:03,534 --> 02:08:06,300
taking many of the survivors
that aren't already bound

2770
02:08:06,334 --> 02:08:10,000
to Thordak and keeping
them underground,

2771
02:08:10,033 --> 02:08:13,234
and kind of building small
underground tent cities

2772
02:08:13,267 --> 02:08:16,033
for them to live in while they
try and figure out what to do.

2773
02:08:16,067 --> 02:08:18,167
It's very interesting
with those of you

2774
02:08:18,200 --> 02:08:20,000
who've lived in Emon
for enough time

2775
02:08:20,033 --> 02:08:22,300
to see so many different people

2776
02:08:22,334 --> 02:08:23,868
and so many different
racial backgrounds,

2777
02:08:23,901 --> 02:08:27,067
and so many different
cultural decrees

2778
02:08:27,100 --> 02:08:31,133
all coming to one point
and all working together

2779
02:08:31,167 --> 02:08:34,133
so quickly and so strongly
just for the sake

2780
02:08:34,167 --> 02:08:38,634
of recovery, for aid and
there is an air of relief.

2781
02:08:38,667 --> 02:08:41,234
Some people are gathering
the dead and identifying them,

2782
02:08:41,267 --> 02:08:43,934
bringing them out into portions
of the streets to make sure

2783
02:08:43,968 --> 02:08:47,167
that they are properly buried

2784
02:08:47,200 --> 02:08:50,213
and the families are
given notification.

2785
02:08:50,213 --> 02:08:52,734
You can see a lot of the
fires are being put out

2786
02:08:52,767 --> 02:08:54,874
and people are doing the
best they can to salvage

2787
02:08:54,874 --> 02:08:57,133
as much of the city
that still stands.

2788
02:08:57,167 --> 02:08:59,334
And a lot of the city
still stands untouched.

2789
02:08:59,367 --> 02:09:01,434
I'd say a good third
of it is gonna need

2790
02:09:01,467 --> 02:09:04,501
some serious reconstruction
and rebuilding.

2791
02:09:04,534 --> 02:09:07,248
And being one of the largest--
if not the largest city

2792
02:09:07,248 --> 02:09:10,501
on the continent, it's
gonna take some time.

2793
02:09:10,534 --> 02:09:12,234
You guys have begun

2794
02:09:12,267 --> 02:09:16,801
to speak with the Warmaster

2795
02:09:16,834 --> 02:09:19,033
as he approaches with his army,

2796
02:09:19,067 --> 02:09:22,501
and kind of trade stories

2797
02:09:22,534 --> 02:09:25,767
on what has transpired
on their end and yours.

2798
02:09:25,801 --> 02:09:28,267
And as this is happening,

2799
02:09:28,300 --> 02:09:32,133
a familiar face steps
into the district

2800
02:09:32,167 --> 02:09:36,000
with a small group
of cloaked figures.

2801
02:09:36,033 --> 02:09:37,701
LAURA: Oh shit.

2802
02:09:37,734 --> 02:09:41,033
MATT: Standing before you,
you see a tall,

2803
02:09:41,067 --> 02:09:44,234
scaled female Dragonborn,

2804
02:09:44,267 --> 02:09:46,601
tailless, armored,

2805
02:09:46,634 --> 02:09:48,667
Tofor Brotorus,

2806
02:09:48,701 --> 02:09:51,033
looking harried and exhausted.

2807
02:09:51,067 --> 02:09:53,534
She steps up and you
see what looks to be

2808
02:09:53,567 --> 02:09:56,901
the cusp of a toothy grin

2809
02:09:56,934 --> 02:09:59,801
at the edge of her mouth as
she catches your attention,

2810
02:09:59,834 --> 02:10:03,167
raises one hand.

2811
02:10:03,200 --> 02:10:06,100
"You have no idea how happy I am

2812
02:10:06,133 --> 02:10:10,033
to see that you all live.

2813
02:10:10,067 --> 02:10:13,567
So, if I'm to be told,
you are the ones

2814
02:10:13,601 --> 02:10:16,534
that took down the Cinder King?"

2815
02:10:16,567 --> 02:10:18,501
-TRAVIS: Yeah.
-TALIESIN: Yes.

2816
02:10:18,534 --> 02:10:23,100
MARISHA: Us and with the aid of
many others, of course.

2817
02:10:23,133 --> 02:10:26,694
MATT: "Then this is indeed
the turning point.

2818
02:10:26,694 --> 02:10:29,667
Do you have access to any
of the members of the council?

2819
02:10:29,701 --> 02:10:31,868
We've been cut off in
the Lyceum for months."

2820
02:10:31,901 --> 02:10:33,767
-TRAVIS: Aye.
-LAURA: Yes.

2821
02:10:33,801 --> 02:10:36,801
MARISHA: Allura is safe is
Whitestone currently.

2822
02:10:36,834 --> 02:10:38,868
We can say Whitestone now right?

2823
02:10:38,901 --> 02:10:40,801
-TALIESIN: We can say Whitestone now, yes.
-MARISHA: Okay.

2824
02:10:40,834 --> 02:10:44,567
-She's safe in Whitestone.
-TRAVIS: Whitestone.

2825
02:10:44,601 --> 02:10:47,367
-Sorry, are we not saying it?
-MARISHA: Whitestone, yeah.

2826
02:10:47,400 --> 02:10:48,667
It's kinda nice saying it again.

2827
02:10:48,701 --> 02:10:50,701
LAURA: Emperor Uriel's
wife and children

2828
02:10:50,734 --> 02:10:52,701
are in Whitestone as well.

2829
02:10:52,734 --> 02:10:55,424
MATT: "This is good to know,
I was worried about them

2830
02:10:55,424 --> 02:10:57,701
after the initial attack.

2831
02:10:57,734 --> 02:11:00,334
Okay, all right."

2832
02:11:00,367 --> 02:11:03,901
MARISHA: Asum should still be
here as well, right?

2833
02:11:03,934 --> 02:11:06,033
-TALIESIN: Back in Whitestone as well.
-MARISHA: Also back in Whitestone?

2834
02:11:06,067 --> 02:11:08,133
SAM: Mhm, Whitestone.
I think--wait,

2835
02:11:08,167 --> 02:11:10,901
Raishan was supposed
to take Asum somewhere.

2836
02:11:10,934 --> 02:11:13,400
Did we ever--
did that ever happen?

2837
02:11:13,434 --> 02:11:15,868
TRAVIS: I thought Asum came
down to the Ziggurat.

2838
02:11:15,901 --> 02:11:18,634
-MARISHA: Yeah.
-SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2839
02:11:18,667 --> 02:11:21,200
MARISHA: Raishan brought Asum back to us.

2840
02:11:21,234 --> 02:11:25,367
-LAURA: Yeah, that.
-LIAM: Sound of confidence.

2841
02:11:25,400 --> 02:11:28,100
-TALIESIN: It was like a month ago.
-MATT: "Very well.

2842
02:11:28,133 --> 02:11:31,167
With Warmaster's aid, and
any of you who are able to,

2843
02:11:31,200 --> 02:11:33,467
we'll begin to do
the best we can

2844
02:11:33,501 --> 02:11:35,434
to restructure some semblance

2845
02:11:35,467 --> 02:11:37,434
of law and order
here within the city."

2846
02:11:37,467 --> 02:11:40,000
MARISHA: And Kima's in there,
she's kind of guarding

2847
02:11:40,033 --> 02:11:43,601
the treasury, if you will.

2848
02:11:43,634 --> 02:11:46,634
-SAM: Solo.
-MARISHA: Solo, by herself.

2849
02:11:46,667 --> 02:11:49,400
LIAM: We were hoping to peel
off some of the troops,

2850
02:11:49,434 --> 02:11:51,601
maybe some of Syngorn's
troops to help

2851
02:11:51,634 --> 02:11:54,200
keep an eye on things in there.

2852
02:11:54,234 --> 02:11:57,634
MATT: "Well, master, could
you make that happen?"

2853
02:11:57,667 --> 02:12:01,434
You see Mikael Daxio
who is currently

2854
02:12:01,467 --> 02:12:03,467
in the midst of giving orders
to a few of his soldiers

2855
02:12:03,501 --> 02:12:05,367
kind of puts his hand
up and walks over.

2856
02:12:05,400 --> 02:12:08,434
"I'm sorry, what?"

2857
02:12:08,467 --> 02:12:10,501
"Mikael, if you would be able

2858
02:12:10,534 --> 02:12:13,567
to offer some aid or
strength of your troops

2859
02:12:13,601 --> 02:12:16,601
to guard what remains

2860
02:12:16,634 --> 02:12:19,834
of the city's economy."

2861
02:12:19,868 --> 02:12:21,734
And Mikael nods.

2862
02:12:21,767 --> 02:12:22,801
"Should not be a worry.

2863
02:12:22,834 --> 02:12:24,434
Of course, I'll uh--"

2864
02:12:24,467 --> 02:12:26,167
and he begins to
talk with Tofor,

2865
02:12:26,200 --> 02:12:27,701
and they begin to break
down and structure

2866
02:12:27,734 --> 02:12:29,033
how people are gonna
go here and there.

2867
02:12:29,067 --> 02:12:31,667
So the longer this progresses,
the more it gets

2868
02:12:31,701 --> 02:12:33,907
into more logistical
conversations.

2869
02:12:33,907 --> 02:12:35,601
What do you guys wanna do?

2870
02:12:35,634 --> 02:12:39,657
MARISHA: I fill them in on
what I saw in scrying.

2871
02:12:39,657 --> 02:12:42,300
More importantly, what
this means is that she

2872
02:12:42,334 --> 02:12:44,234
is on this plane of existence.

2873
02:12:44,267 --> 02:12:48,734
I can't scry if she's on
another plane, so she's here.

2874
02:12:48,767 --> 02:12:51,767
LIAM: Do you know where
that island is?

2875
02:12:51,801 --> 02:12:54,000
♪

2876
02:12:54,033 --> 02:12:56,634
MARISHA: I could attempt to think

2877
02:12:56,667 --> 02:12:59,667
really hard about it.

2878
02:12:59,701 --> 02:13:00,767
I could attempt to think.

2879
02:13:00,767 --> 02:13:03,540
SAM: The Marisha Ray Story.

2880
02:13:03,540 --> 02:13:05,334
LIAM: Scrying doesn't
give any direction.

2881
02:13:05,334 --> 02:13:07,434
MATT: I mean even the
visuals I'm giving

2882
02:13:07,467 --> 02:13:10,000
from a narrative standpoint
are like a little more

2883
02:13:10,033 --> 02:13:11,868
than the spell should,
but it's for fun.

2884
02:13:11,901 --> 02:13:15,000
MARISHA: Can I do like a--can
I do a roll to see--

2885
02:13:15,033 --> 02:13:18,467
-MATT: Make an intelligence check.
-MARISHA: Oh, geez.

2886
02:13:18,501 --> 02:13:21,434
Thanks for your vote
of confidence, Sam.

2887
02:13:21,467 --> 02:13:23,434
That's not good,
that's not good.

2888
02:13:23,467 --> 02:13:25,133
-SAM: For the dice.
-MARISHA: This is your fault.

2889
02:13:25,167 --> 02:13:27,667
-It's a five total.
-SAM: Yeah, it is.

2890
02:13:27,701 --> 02:13:30,501
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait, no, just a
straight intelligence check?

2891
02:13:30,534 --> 02:13:33,634
-MATT: Yup, intelligence modifier.
-MARISHA: Yeah, it's five.

2892
02:13:33,667 --> 02:13:36,801
MATT: Yeah, you've--you,
for lack of a better term,

2893
02:13:36,834 --> 02:13:39,267
are the homeschooled
one of the bunch,

2894
02:13:39,300 --> 02:13:42,868
and you only recently left the--

2895
02:13:42,901 --> 02:13:47,100
well, before meeting the
rest of these adventurers,

2896
02:13:47,133 --> 02:13:49,167
you know, left Zephra to go

2897
02:13:49,200 --> 02:13:50,501
and see what the
world was about.

2898
02:13:50,534 --> 02:13:53,000
So, unfortunately, you don't
have as much worldly experience

2899
02:13:53,033 --> 02:13:54,767
as other people
on your team would.

2900
02:13:54,801 --> 02:13:57,767
So the visuals you
have clear in your mind,

2901
02:13:57,801 --> 02:14:02,434
you have no personal life
experience or any place

2902
02:14:02,467 --> 02:14:05,033
that you've seen that you
can connect the dots to.

2903
02:14:05,067 --> 02:14:07,033
MARISHA: I turned to Pike and asked--

2904
02:14:07,067 --> 02:14:09,667
and tell her of the island,

2905
02:14:09,701 --> 02:14:12,467
and ask if she has
encountered anything

2906
02:14:12,501 --> 02:14:16,400
like this in her travels.

2907
02:14:16,434 --> 02:14:19,667
MATT: She closes her eyes for a second
and kinda winces a little bit,

2908
02:14:19,701 --> 02:14:22,701
her tongue kinda peaks outside
her mouth for a second.

2909
02:14:22,734 --> 02:14:26,734
"Uh, no.

2910
02:14:26,767 --> 02:14:29,133
Wide ocean, you said, right?"

2911
02:14:29,167 --> 02:14:33,767
MARISHA: Big, nothing but ocean, except
for that one singular island.

2912
02:14:33,801 --> 02:14:36,534
It looked like there was
geothermal activity going on,

2913
02:14:36,567 --> 02:14:41,067
so it must be near a
volcano or something.

2914
02:14:41,100 --> 02:14:44,100
MATT: "Most of my sailing was
done in the Ozmit Sea."

2915
02:14:44,133 --> 02:14:45,601
MARISHA: Nothing like that?

2916
02:14:45,634 --> 02:14:47,617
MATT: "Nothing that I've seen.

2917
02:14:47,617 --> 02:14:49,294
Sorry."

2918
02:14:50,267 --> 02:14:52,834
MARISHA: It's okay, Pikey.

2919
02:14:52,868 --> 02:14:55,267
PATRICK: I'll throw a Hail Mary,
like how wide-ranging

2920
02:14:55,300 --> 02:14:57,667
was I back in the day

2921
02:14:57,701 --> 02:14:59,701
when I was doing
this for my career?

2922
02:14:59,734 --> 02:15:01,801
Any of this sound
familiar to me?

2923
02:15:01,834 --> 02:15:04,567
-MATT: Roll an intelligence check.
-LAURA: Come on!

2924
02:15:04,601 --> 02:15:08,133
(mixed remarks)

2925
02:15:08,167 --> 02:15:11,067
Natural 20!

2926
02:15:11,100 --> 02:15:13,067
-PATRICK: Eighteen.
-MATT: Eighteen?

2927
02:15:13,100 --> 02:15:15,334
Plus your intelligence modifier?

2928
02:15:15,367 --> 02:15:18,601
PATRICK: Eighteen.

2929
02:15:18,634 --> 02:15:21,033
No negative modifiers.

2930
02:15:21,067 --> 02:15:23,400
MATT: That's good.
Must be nice.

2931
02:15:23,434 --> 02:15:26,434
(laughing)

2932
02:15:29,667 --> 02:15:32,033
As Keyleth is going over
the description again,

2933
02:15:32,067 --> 02:15:35,400
you're thinking about it,
and you did a bit of sailing.

2934
02:15:35,434 --> 02:15:39,000
Sailing in the Lucidian
Ocean is difficult.

2935
02:15:39,033 --> 02:15:43,434
That's why Wildmount...

2936
02:15:43,467 --> 02:15:46,534
-Take it outside, Liam.
-LAURA: He's good, he's good.

2937
02:15:46,567 --> 02:15:48,267
-MARISHA: Don't die.
-LIAM: I pulled the wrong card

2938
02:15:48,300 --> 02:15:50,467
from the deck.

2939
02:15:50,501 --> 02:15:54,234
MATT: The glass of many drinks.

2940
02:15:54,267 --> 02:15:57,133
You've done a bit of
sailing out of necessity,

2941
02:15:57,167 --> 02:16:00,133
and the Lucidian Ocean is known
for being the more treacherous

2942
02:16:00,167 --> 02:16:02,133
of the large bodies
of water, which is why

2943
02:16:02,167 --> 02:16:04,601
between Wildmount and
the other continents

2944
02:16:04,634 --> 02:16:06,167
there isn't a whole lot
of trade, or the trade

2945
02:16:06,200 --> 02:16:08,868
that's out there is generally
considered very expensive

2946
02:16:08,901 --> 02:16:13,167
and for rarer items
and resources.

2947
02:16:13,200 --> 02:16:15,767
What catches your
mind is the idea

2948
02:16:15,801 --> 02:16:18,167
of geothermal activity.

2949
02:16:18,200 --> 02:16:22,033
And while you haven't

2950
02:16:22,067 --> 02:16:24,734
specifically been
to a place like that,

2951
02:16:24,767 --> 02:16:27,067
the islands you know
that usually contain

2952
02:16:27,100 --> 02:16:29,734
that type of
subvolcanic activity

2953
02:16:29,767 --> 02:16:34,133
to expel that type of, you know,

2954
02:16:34,165 --> 02:16:37,566
region based terrain,

2955
02:16:37,601 --> 02:16:41,534
those usually are in
the southern region,

2956
02:16:41,566 --> 02:16:43,400
south of Tal'Dorei.

2957
02:16:43,433 --> 02:16:46,601
♪

2958
02:16:46,634 --> 02:16:50,534
More like southern,
southern Ozmit Sea.

2959
02:16:50,566 --> 02:16:53,334
Close, but not specifically
to the Hespit Archipelago,

2960
02:16:53,367 --> 02:16:56,400
but somewhere in that
similar type region.

2961
02:16:56,433 --> 02:16:58,400
♪

2962
02:16:58,433 --> 02:17:00,868
SAM: Hespit Archipelago?

2963

TRAVIS: I believe it's archipela-jo.

2964
02:17:03,165 --> 02:17:04,933
MATT: I'm gonna throw every
dice at you, Travis.

2965
02:17:04,968 --> 02:17:07,933
(laughing)

2966
02:17:07,968 --> 02:17:09,700
MARISHA: Southern southern Ozmit Sea.

2967
02:17:09,734 --> 02:17:13,467
PATRICK: This lair did not seem to
be the bookish sort of lair,

2968
02:17:13,501 --> 02:17:16,799
like the sort of dragon
who collects a lot of lore,

2969
02:17:16,834 --> 02:17:18,767
and would have like,
stuff like that, no.

2970
02:17:18,799 --> 02:17:21,566
MATT: No, not this one, this--the--

2971
02:17:21,601 --> 02:17:23,433
Thordak in particular
has been interesting too,

2972
02:17:23,467 --> 02:17:25,767
and as people have been
discussing it here--

2973
02:17:25,799 --> 02:17:28,100
once a very intelligent

2974
02:17:28,133 --> 02:17:30,968
and cunning Red Dragon.

2975
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:32,267
You don't know the
full details of it,

2976
02:17:32,299 --> 02:17:35,467
but there was something
about his return

2977
02:17:35,501 --> 02:17:39,868
to this realm after being sealed
on the Fire Elemental plane,

2978
02:17:39,901 --> 02:17:42,634
his return involved harboring

2979
02:17:42,665 --> 02:17:45,501
an enchanted gem within
his chest that kind of held

2980
02:17:45,534 --> 02:17:47,901
and carried the essence of
the Fire plane with him,

2981
02:17:47,933 --> 02:17:50,700
and the longer it
resided within Thordak,

2982
02:17:50,734 --> 02:17:53,901
it caused him to mutate
and swell into this, like,

2983
02:17:53,933 --> 02:17:58,165
primordial beast dragon,
but it also drove him insane.

2984
02:17:58,200 --> 02:18:00,367
And so everything
you've seen in the lair,

2985
02:18:00,400 --> 02:18:04,334
it seems to be a natural
chaotic formation

2986
02:18:04,367 --> 02:18:07,000
of a more feral
type dragon mentality

2987
02:18:07,031 --> 02:18:09,133
than what you've heard
about in your travels.

2988
02:18:09,165 --> 02:18:12,665
PATRICK: Right, um, the only other thing

2989
02:18:12,700 --> 02:18:15,234
I can think of from
what you've described

2990
02:18:15,267 --> 02:18:19,200
is if she was there, and she--

2991
02:18:19,234 --> 02:18:23,566
and this place was obviously
in ruin and abandoned,

2992
02:18:23,601 --> 02:18:26,933
and she was tossing at
looking for information--

2993
02:18:26,968 --> 02:18:29,968
it wasn't hers,
but it's abandoned--

2994
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,400
the only thing I can think
of that she would want

2995
02:18:32,433 --> 02:18:35,433
would be some sort
of lore or magic,

2996
02:18:35,467 --> 02:18:37,834
which means this is the lab

2997
02:18:37,868 --> 02:18:40,700
of someone powerful,

2998
02:18:40,734 --> 02:18:42,700
which means those people

2999
02:18:42,734 --> 02:18:45,734
show up in stories.

3000
02:18:45,767 --> 02:18:50,234
And so, that might be

3001
02:18:50,267 --> 02:18:53,868
a way to find out where this is.

3002
02:18:53,901 --> 02:18:56,868
In this area, if you find out

3003
02:18:56,901 --> 02:18:59,868
who was doing terrible things--

3004
02:18:59,901 --> 02:19:01,700
'cause you said cages, right?

3005
02:19:01,734 --> 02:19:04,634
-MARISHA: Yes.
-PATRICK: Nothing good comes from cages.

3006
02:19:04,665 --> 02:19:09,100
So whoever was doing terrible
things in that area--

3007
02:19:09,133 --> 02:19:11,400
LAURA: Maybe a necromancer
of some sort?

3008
02:19:11,433 --> 02:19:15,133
PATRICK: Well, if she stole
a dead dragon...

3009
02:19:15,165 --> 02:19:17,501
LAURA: Hm, all right.

3010
02:19:17,534 --> 02:19:21,234
TALIESIN: Can I make a lore roll
for Booky McBookerson?

3011
02:19:21,267 --> 02:19:23,367
MATT: Make a history check.

3012
02:19:25,400 --> 02:19:26,700
TALIESIN: Natural twenty.

3013
02:19:26,734 --> 02:19:29,433
(cheering)

3014
02:19:29,467 --> 02:19:32,700
PATRICK: The look of incredulity
on his face!

3015
02:19:32,734 --> 02:19:35,734
TALIESIN: That's a 29.

3016
02:19:35,767 --> 02:19:37,665
MATT: Literally was like,
If he's...

3017
02:19:37,700 --> 02:19:40,968
he better roll
a natural-- okay.

3018
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,734
TALIESIN: You're just gonna hand me your
notebook and I can just read.

3019
02:19:43,767 --> 02:19:46,334
-MATT: No.
-TRAVIS: Well done, man.

3020
02:19:46,367 --> 02:19:48,165
MARISHA: Holy shit, holy shit!

3021
02:19:48,200 --> 02:19:49,901
TALIESIN: Knew there was one
in there somewhere.

3022
02:19:49,934 --> 02:19:52,901
MARISHA: Oh my god, you just saved
us a trip to the library.

3023
02:19:52,934 --> 02:19:55,000
-MATT: Don't say that yet.
-TALIESIN: I was about to say,

3024
02:19:55,033 --> 02:19:56,834
no, we're going to the library.

3025
02:19:56,868 --> 02:19:59,734
Use these places or
they disappear.

3026
02:19:59,767 --> 02:20:02,100
MATT: You have always had

3027
02:20:02,133 --> 02:20:04,901
a mild fascination
with the macabre.

3028
02:20:04,934 --> 02:20:09,467
And since the Age of
Arcanum was also referred

3029
02:20:09,501 --> 02:20:12,067
to as the Age of
Wanton Necromancy,

3030
02:20:12,100 --> 02:20:15,033
because at the time,
there was no law against it.

3031
02:20:15,067 --> 02:20:19,234
While necromancy exists
in modern day Tal'Dorei--

3032
02:20:19,267 --> 02:20:22,067
more so in Wildmount,
but it's generally

3033
02:20:22,100 --> 02:20:25,634
heavily regulated.

3034
02:20:27,834 --> 02:20:30,868
There are very few necromancers
that weren't sanctioned

3035
02:20:30,901 --> 02:20:34,000
or part of a government
system so that

3036
02:20:34,033 --> 02:20:35,667
it could be very
closely watched,

3037
02:20:35,701 --> 02:20:37,868
and any sort of research or
development could be made,

3038
02:20:37,901 --> 02:20:40,200
you know, made sure
that it didn't turn into

3039
02:20:40,234 --> 02:20:42,868
the usual classic, you know--
My power's greater

3040
02:20:42,901 --> 02:20:44,968
than everything, I'm gonna
go off and do my own thing.

3041
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,421
The den that she's
describing is very much

3042
02:20:47,421 --> 02:20:49,667
that type of a necromancer.

3043
02:20:49,701 --> 02:20:52,300
And there are only a handful

3044
02:20:52,334 --> 02:20:55,300
that catch your attention.

3045
02:20:55,334 --> 02:20:58,767
One, uh,

3046
02:20:58,801 --> 02:21:03,033
is an entity that you're
very familiar with.

3047
02:21:03,067 --> 02:21:04,767
That is what was once

3048
02:21:04,801 --> 02:21:08,167
a great mage, necromancer,

3049
02:21:08,200 --> 02:21:11,834
that began to pursue

3050
02:21:11,868 --> 02:21:15,834
ascension to god-dom,

3051
02:21:15,868 --> 02:21:17,234
known as the Whispered One,

3052
02:21:17,267 --> 02:21:19,667
or the very familiar
name of Vecna.

3053
02:21:19,701 --> 02:21:21,834
However, however,

3054
02:21:21,868 --> 02:21:25,601
the acknowledgement
of Vecna's history

3055
02:21:25,634 --> 02:21:28,200
was heavily tied into Wildmount,

3056
02:21:28,234 --> 02:21:29,934
and what little bit
of research you've done

3057
02:21:29,968 --> 02:21:33,167
into the back history
of the Briarwoods

3058
02:21:33,200 --> 02:21:36,934
says that wherever Vecna's old,

3059
02:21:36,968 --> 02:21:39,801
forgotten laboratory was,

3060
02:21:39,834 --> 02:21:42,967
it most likely existed on
the continent of Wildmount.

3061
02:21:42,967 --> 02:21:45,167
The only other individual
you can think of

3062
02:21:45,200 --> 02:21:47,534
that is known historically

3063
02:21:47,567 --> 02:21:51,534
was an individual
known as Opash.

3064
02:21:51,567 --> 02:21:54,834
Opash was a
sanctioned necromancer

3065
02:21:54,868 --> 02:21:58,234
during the Age of Arcanum

3066
02:21:58,267 --> 02:22:00,601
on the continent of Marquet,

3067
02:22:00,634 --> 02:22:04,100
and then after being
discovered to be

3068
02:22:04,133 --> 02:22:08,300
delving into his own
experimentations,

3069
02:22:08,334 --> 02:22:12,100
largely in the idea of
crafting and sculpting flesh

3070
02:22:12,133 --> 02:22:15,000
and undead flesh into
whatever form it wishes,

3071
02:22:15,033 --> 02:22:18,968
as well as the prolonging of
life to pursue this endeavor,

3072
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:23,200
was set to be,
was set to be executed.

3073
02:22:23,234 --> 02:22:26,834
Through some very,
very clever conversations

3074
02:22:26,868 --> 02:22:30,033
and favors that were owed

3075
02:22:30,067 --> 02:22:32,868
to Opash, it was agreed instead

3076
02:22:32,901 --> 02:22:36,757
to just banish the
necromancer out to sea.

3077
02:22:36,757 --> 02:22:39,567
-SAM: Well, that could be it too.
-MARISHA: Wait, what was that last part?

3078
02:22:39,601 --> 02:22:41,701
That was really important,
banish the necromancer

3079
02:22:41,734 --> 02:22:45,000
-out to sea?
-MATT: Banished out to sea.

3080
02:22:45,033 --> 02:22:48,200
-MARISHA: Who was banished to sea?
-MATT: Opash.

3081
02:22:48,234 --> 02:22:50,934
SAM: So those are two different
stories, two different--

3082
02:22:50,968 --> 02:22:55,300
MATT: Those are the only two, like,
famous necromancers that--

3083
02:22:55,334 --> 02:22:58,567
-SAM: Are a-sea.
-LAURA: You're brilliant.

3084
02:22:58,601 --> 02:23:02,701
MARISHA: You guys--you're all--
we have such smart friends.

3085
02:23:02,734 --> 02:23:05,100
Oh my goodness.

3086
02:23:05,133 --> 02:23:06,667
TALIESIN: Well, we need to, in theory,

3087
02:23:06,701 --> 02:23:09,868
find the last resting
place of Opash.

3088
02:23:09,901 --> 02:23:14,200
MARISHA: Well, you know, we have--

3089
02:23:14,234 --> 02:23:16,400
TALIESIN: Can't be harder than
killing a Red Dragon.

3090
02:23:16,434 --> 02:23:19,968
MARISHA: We have a paladin
of the Raven Queen,

3091
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:23,730
and from what I remember, the
Raven Queen hates necromancers.

3092
02:23:23,730 --> 02:23:26,267
LAURA: Vecna is one of
her sworn enemies.

3093
02:23:26,300 --> 02:23:29,868
MARISHA: Maybe she knows, maybe
you could talk to her.

3094
02:23:29,901 --> 02:23:33,000
TALIESIN: We can do that
back at Whitestone.

3095
02:23:33,033 --> 02:23:35,801
PATRICK: What do I know about
the Raven Queen?

3096
02:23:35,834 --> 02:23:37,801
(laughing)

3097
02:23:37,834 --> 02:23:41,133
Because that one's,
that one's new to me.

3098
02:23:41,167 --> 02:23:43,467
MATT: So yes, it catches
your attention.

3099
02:23:43,501 --> 02:23:45,834
The Raven Queen,
the mother of ravens

3100
02:23:45,868 --> 02:23:50,400
is, um, is a fairly
prominent member

3101
02:23:50,434 --> 02:23:53,467
of the Pantheon of Exandria,
the entire world.

3102
02:23:53,501 --> 02:23:55,934
Once immortal,
ascended to take on

3103
02:23:55,968 --> 02:23:59,734
the mantle of death and winter

3104
02:23:59,767 --> 02:24:03,334
as her domains of influence.

3105
02:24:03,367 --> 02:24:07,868
She presides not
over the afterlife,

3106
02:24:07,901 --> 02:24:12,467
but the moment in transition
from life to death.

3107
02:24:12,501 --> 02:24:15,734
She is the keeper of fate,

3108
02:24:15,767 --> 02:24:19,734
and keeps watch over
the destinies of those

3109
02:24:19,767 --> 02:24:22,834
who walk the prime
and beyond planes,

3110
02:24:22,868 --> 02:24:25,968
and occasionally takes
interest in those

3111
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,767
that tend to bend the
threads around them.

3112
02:24:28,801 --> 02:24:31,834
Um, you know,

3113
02:24:31,868 --> 02:24:33,667
resurrection, healing magic,

3114
02:24:33,701 --> 02:24:36,701
things that maintain
life naturally

3115
02:24:36,734 --> 02:24:39,334
or a natural life, per se,

3116
02:24:39,367 --> 02:24:41,467
are not infractions
upon her belief

3117
02:24:41,501 --> 02:24:44,367
as destiny is stronger and
if an entity is meant to live

3118
02:24:44,400 --> 02:24:46,767
to fulfill his destiny,

3119
02:24:46,801 --> 02:24:49,267
then that is how
it's meant to be.

3120
02:24:49,300 --> 02:24:51,467
It's the creatures
that pervert destiny,

3121
02:24:51,501 --> 02:24:55,234
creatures that bypassed
the natural predestined

3122
02:24:55,267 --> 02:24:59,601
and essentially, balk what,

3123
02:24:59,634 --> 02:25:02,200
in her sphere,
says is supposed to be

3124
02:25:02,234 --> 02:25:04,234
your way, your path,
your timeline.

3125
02:25:04,267 --> 02:25:06,968
Those are her fervent enemies.

3126
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,634
Largely feared because
of what she represents.

3127
02:25:09,667 --> 02:25:13,234
Largely misunderstood because
of what she represents.

3128
02:25:13,267 --> 02:25:15,367
Generally, worship of the
Raven Queen is pretty rare

3129
02:25:15,400 --> 02:25:17,734
from the circles
you've run into.

3130
02:25:17,767 --> 02:25:19,970
You've generally
walked in a lot of--

3131
02:25:19,970 --> 02:25:22,001
especially in recent years--

3132
02:25:22,001 --> 02:25:24,334
more, um--

3133
02:25:24,367 --> 02:25:26,968
for lack of a better term--

3134
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,901
-not urban--
-LAURA: Rural.

3135
02:25:29,934 --> 02:25:32,334
MATT: Rural, thank you,
more rural environments

3136
02:25:32,367 --> 02:25:33,968
Raven Queen worship
is acknowledged,

3137
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,601
but generally there's
no temples to her.

3138
02:25:36,634 --> 02:25:38,734
-PATRICK: Right, okay.
-TALIESIN: I love the notion of

3139
02:25:38,767 --> 02:25:41,667
cornfield Raven Queen worship.

3140
02:25:41,701 --> 02:25:43,167
LAURA: So creepy.

3141
02:25:43,200 --> 02:25:45,267
TALIESIN: Ohh, I'm damned for that.

3142
02:25:45,300 --> 02:25:47,501
(laughing)

3143
02:25:47,534 --> 02:25:49,701
MATT: Oh, don't worry, you'll

3144
02:25:49,734 --> 02:25:51,133
get to Wildmount eventually.

3145
02:25:51,167 --> 02:25:54,334
-MARISHA: I'm sure they're out there.
-TALIESIN: The harvest is good this year.

3146
02:25:54,367 --> 02:25:56,434
LAURA: You know, Raishan did say--

3147
02:25:56,467 --> 02:25:59,234
I mean, I know she's
prone to lying,

3148
02:25:59,267 --> 02:26:01,868
but she did say she
was from Wildmount.

3149
02:26:01,901 --> 02:26:05,467
That's where she wanted
to go back to she said.

3150
02:26:07,601 --> 02:26:10,834
TALIESIN: We have two very clean paths.

3151
02:26:10,868 --> 02:26:14,234
LAURA: Maybe she's studying necromancy,
maybe she's been studying Vecna,

3152
02:26:14,267 --> 02:26:15,934
maybe she's been studying Opash.

3153
02:26:15,968 --> 02:26:18,767
TALIESIN: Maybe she's been studying a
lot of things, but one of them

3154
02:26:18,801 --> 02:26:22,667
would probably be how to
resurrect a red dragon.

3155
02:26:22,701 --> 02:26:25,734
MARISHA: And she's also very
familiar with, I'm sure,

3156
02:26:25,767 --> 02:26:28,667
whatever the Briarwoods were
doing, and with whatever

3157
02:26:28,701 --> 02:26:31,567
the Ziggurat is on
the bottom of Whitestone

3158
02:26:31,601 --> 02:26:34,067
that we still don't know
what it's technically for.

3159
02:26:34,100 --> 02:26:35,400
-LAURA: She knows what it is.
-MARISHA: I bet she does.

3160
02:26:35,434 --> 02:26:38,133
LAURA: She knows what
the orb of death is.

3161
02:26:38,167 --> 02:26:41,200
-MARISHA: Is Gilmore still around?
-MATT: Gilmore is.

3162
02:26:41,234 --> 02:26:43,501
Gilmore's kind of listening
to the conversation

3163
02:26:43,534 --> 02:26:46,033
while finishing closing off
the satchels that he's filled

3164
02:26:46,067 --> 02:26:48,734
with coin, and is currently
kind of thinking to himself

3165
02:26:48,767 --> 02:26:51,434
with his, you know,
fingers crossed, his chin

3166
02:26:51,467 --> 02:26:53,801
kind of perched upon his hands,
and himself, trying to see

3167
02:26:53,834 --> 02:26:56,000
if there's anything he knows
out of the conversation.

3168
02:26:56,033 --> 02:26:57,767
You do notice that also at
this point there's a very faint

3169
02:26:57,801 --> 02:26:59,267
glowing glyph on his forehead.

3170
02:26:59,300 --> 02:27:02,901
-MARISHA: Yeah.
-SAM: What is that thing?

3171
02:27:02,934 --> 02:27:04,467
-MATT: Do you say that?
-LAURA: Yeah.

3172
02:27:04,501 --> 02:27:07,901
-What's going on there?
-TALIESIN: What's on your face?

3173
02:27:07,934 --> 02:27:10,567
MARISHA: You've got a little, you've
got a little something.

3174
02:27:10,601 --> 02:27:14,567
SAM: You always look dashing,
but you have a new added

3175
02:27:14,601 --> 02:27:16,801
dashing feature to your
forehead right now.

3176
02:27:16,834 --> 02:27:20,067
-LAURA: Gold, right up--
-MATT: Oh, and he kinda waves a hand

3177
02:27:20,100 --> 02:27:23,067
briefly, and it kind of
fades back into his skin

3178
02:27:23,100 --> 02:27:24,767
and it's like there's
no glow there.

3179
02:27:24,801 --> 02:27:27,968
"Ha, it's a, it's a,

3180
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:32,367
just a thing."

3181
02:27:32,400 --> 02:27:34,968
SAM: Oh, that seems fine, okay.

3182
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,667
(laughing)

3183
02:27:37,701 --> 02:27:40,501
-LAURA: No, seriously.
-MARISHA: Hopefully a good thing.

3184
02:27:40,534 --> 02:27:43,033
MATT: "Everyone has their
magical specialties.

3185

I, um, I carry,

3186

I carry power in my bloodline."

3187
02:27:51,167 --> 02:27:53,143
SAM: What power?

3188
02:27:54,297 --> 02:27:56,767
MATT: He looks back,

kind of in the vicinity,

-LAURA: I know, what does it mean?

down in the, in the lair.

Can you identify this?

still available, certainly.

Oh, this is quite
a fancy endeavor."

it'll perform for you.

The sword goes clang-clang.

The music's playing,
sword just stays there.

of this ornate scimitar,
the music emanating

going to build a list,

Raishan will stay there?

what she's looking for.

what I would do.

If I thought that I was
going to be safe somewhere,

I would stay there
and simply hunt out,

you were scrying on her?

in on our home, our keep,

3324
02:34:07,901 --> 02:34:10,234
and do anything there
before we leave?

night in the keep

back to Whitestone using
my last seventh level spell,

3331

3336
02:34:42,300 --> 02:34:44,767
-LIAM: We could get in a line.
-MARISHA: I think my record was like

3337
02:34:44,801 --> 02:34:47,334
25 people when we were
moving refugees through.

3338
02:34:47,367 --> 02:34:50,834
Yeah, it was pretty good,
still trying to break that.

really trying to break it."

and if anything, it's really--

3347
02:35:11,400 --> 02:35:14,868
this experience has helped me
come to terms with the fact

3348
02:35:14,901 --> 02:35:18,767
that I should not be
on the battlefield.

3349
02:35:18,801 --> 02:35:21,434
I need to stay in
the shop, and I--"

TRAVIS: That is not true, that finger
of yours is very powerful.

02:35:24,200 --> 02:35:26,934

also on fire a lot.

3352
02:35:26,968 --> 02:35:28,634
-I want to avoid that."
-TRAVIS: That's true.

3353
02:35:28,667 --> 02:35:30,734
TALIESIN: Are you gonna be
rebuilding your shop here

3354
02:35:30,767 --> 02:35:33,234
or are we gonna see you
in Whitestone as well?

3355
02:35:33,267 --> 02:35:35,334
MATT: "You know, my intent
a while back

3356
02:35:35,367 --> 02:35:39,067
was to start a franchise.

3357
02:35:39,100 --> 02:35:41,667
We'll see how the winds carry
me, after all, I think--"

3358
02:35:41,701 --> 02:35:44,234
And he kinda tugs open this
large heavy sack and satchel

3359
02:35:44,267 --> 02:35:47,033
that's on his side now,
and to the other side you see

3360
02:35:47,067 --> 02:35:51,467
a small compact bag of
holding, and he goes,

3361
02:35:51,501 --> 02:35:53,467
"I think I've got
it taken care of."

3362

(laughing)

3363
02:35:56,567 --> 02:35:57,868
-LAURA: Nice.
-TRAVIS: Brilliant.

3364
02:35:57,901 --> 02:36:00,367
We wish you well, Gilmore.

3365
02:36:00,400 --> 02:36:01,801
MATT: "Well, I mean, if you're
going to Whitestone,

3366
02:36:01,834 --> 02:36:04,534
-I'm coming with you."
-TRAVIS: No, you gotta stay.

3367
02:36:04,567 --> 02:36:06,200
I'm just kidding, you can come.

3368
02:36:06,234 --> 02:36:08,734
(laughing)

3369
02:36:08,767 --> 02:36:11,868
LAURA: Ker, are you gonna come
to Whitestone with us?

3370
02:36:11,901 --> 02:36:15,167
♪

3371
02:36:15,200 --> 02:36:17,300
LIAM: Stay the night and
have a drink with us.

3372
02:36:17,334 --> 02:36:19,868
-SAM: Are we going now?
-LAURA: We can bounce you back.

3373
02:36:19,901 --> 02:36:23,767
SAM: We're not even gonna go to
our keep for a little bit.

3374
02:36:23,801 --> 02:36:25,901
-Did we go there?
-TALIESIN: We did, we came in.

3375
02:36:25,934 --> 02:36:28,267
-Stopped by the ruins.
-SAM: All right.

3376
02:36:28,300 --> 02:36:31,267
TRAVIS: Heyo, heyo, Ker, heyo.

3377
02:36:31,300 --> 02:36:33,634
PATRICK: I could use a drink,
I would love to.

3378
02:36:33,667 --> 02:36:36,501
I would love to,
give me just a moment,

3379
02:36:36,534 --> 02:36:39,267
and I head back to the troops

3380
02:36:39,300 --> 02:36:42,467
and I talk to, like,
the couple of them

3381
02:36:42,501 --> 02:36:45,167
that have kind
of like risen up--

3382
02:36:45,200 --> 02:36:47,133
-LAURA: Samantha.
-PATRICK: Samantha, yeah,

3383
02:36:47,167 --> 02:36:49,133
like fucking runs the
whole thing right now.

3384
02:36:49,167 --> 02:36:51,934
-LIAM: Sam's pretty legit.
-PATRICK: Yeah.

3385
02:36:51,968 --> 02:36:54,968
And so--and I also

3386
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:58,567
kind of circumspectly--

3387
02:36:58,601 --> 02:37:03,133
I sort of distribute
a little bit of money.

3388
02:37:03,167 --> 02:37:06,067
I give Samantha some,
and this is like--

3389
02:37:06,100 --> 02:37:08,033
it's like if something happens,

3390
02:37:08,067 --> 02:37:12,400
if I don't come back,
here's how long you stay,

3391
02:37:12,434 --> 02:37:15,534
here's what to do
among the populous.

3392
02:37:15,567 --> 02:37:19,534
Like--and I don't need to
give them the talk of like,

3393
02:37:19,567 --> 02:37:22,434
No looting, 'cause they've
already had Daddy Ker

3394
02:37:22,467 --> 02:37:24,977
like constantly lecturing them
about how to not be dicks.

3395
02:37:24,977 --> 02:37:27,267
MATT: The kind of people that would
follow you into battle for this,

3396
02:37:27,300 --> 02:37:29,400
as small as your group was,
the kind of people that you know

3397
02:37:29,434 --> 02:37:31,200
you can trust this, and
Samantha with her like,

3398
02:37:31,234 --> 02:37:33,634
kind of, you know, graying
hair that's pulled into

3399
02:37:33,667 --> 02:37:36,200
this kind of hard topknot
on top, and her darker skin

3400
02:37:36,234 --> 02:37:39,734
with the scar across her cheek,
and her breastplate of armor,

3401
02:37:39,767 --> 02:37:41,634
she comes up and kind of
grabs your hand and goes,

3402
02:37:41,667 --> 02:37:43,701
"Don't worry, I've got it
taken care of, it's fine."

3403
02:37:43,734 --> 02:37:46,133
PATRICK: Right, yeah, it's right,
you've done it before.

3404
02:37:46,167 --> 02:37:49,000
MATT: "We've gathered the dead, we'll
make sure with what you've given

3405
02:37:49,033 --> 02:37:51,734
that we'll get it back to
the families that remain."

3406
02:37:51,767 --> 02:37:55,067
PATRICK: Right, this is gonna be

3407
02:37:55,100 --> 02:37:58,567
a tricky place for
a couple of weeks,

3408
02:37:58,601 --> 02:38:02,000
and not only could our
people maybe use a rest,

3409
02:38:02,033 --> 02:38:05,667
but maybe it would benefit from

3410
02:38:05,701 --> 02:38:09,434
30 or 40 level-handed
people with swords

3411
02:38:09,467 --> 02:38:12,200
maybe keeping an eye out,

3412
02:38:12,234 --> 02:38:14,167
maybe traveling in
pairs around the city

3413
02:38:14,200 --> 02:38:17,100
making sure nobody's
houses get broken into.

3414
02:38:17,133 --> 02:38:19,400
Just--you can't take
care of everything,

3415
02:38:19,434 --> 02:38:22,567
but it would not be bad to
camp out maybe for a week.

3416
02:38:22,601 --> 02:38:24,868
Wait for me, and I'll be back,

3417
02:38:24,901 --> 02:38:26,868
and if I'm not,
you know where to go.

3418
02:38:26,901 --> 02:38:31,000
MATT: "Hey, I'm always down to
rough up some ruffians."

3419
02:38:31,033 --> 02:38:34,817
PATRICK: It's--yeah, okay.

3420
02:38:34,817 --> 02:38:37,367
-MATT: "Ker, go with your friends."
-PATRICK: Okay.

3421
02:38:37,400 --> 02:38:40,033
TRAVIS: Is Samantha attractive?

3422
02:38:40,067 --> 02:38:43,100
LAURA: Should we--just ignore.

3423
02:38:43,133 --> 02:38:46,901
She has that breastplate.

3424
02:38:46,934 --> 02:38:50,000
MATT: Yeah, I mean, she
looks like she could

3425
02:38:50,033 --> 02:38:52,801
definitely bruise you in
the face with a left hook.

3426
02:38:52,834 --> 02:38:54,801
So, for you, yeah.

3427
02:38:54,834 --> 02:38:56,367
TRAVIS: Awesome, hey, Ker, Ker.

3428
02:38:56,400 --> 02:38:59,534
-PATRICK: Hm?
-TRAVIS: Put in a good word.

3429
02:38:59,567 --> 02:39:02,801
PATRICK: I--she--I...

3430
02:39:02,834 --> 02:39:06,334
(laughing)

3431
02:39:06,367 --> 02:39:08,267
TRAVIS: Hey.

3432
02:39:08,300 --> 02:39:11,434
♪

3433
02:39:11,467 --> 02:39:13,100
MATT: "He's going with you, right?"

3434
02:39:13,133 --> 02:39:16,234
-PATRICK: Yeah.
-MATT: "Great, okay."

3435
02:39:16,267 --> 02:39:18,033

3436
02:39:18,067 --> 02:39:20,267
MATT: Yeah, Kima's ready
to go, she's like,

3437
02:39:20,300 --> 02:39:22,701
"All right, we're going
back to Whitestone?"

3438
02:39:22,734 --> 02:39:24,133
LAURA: Does everything look
like it's in order

3439
02:39:24,167 --> 02:39:25,901
with Daxio, with everyone here?

3440
02:39:25,934 --> 02:39:27,300
-MATT: "Sure."
-LAURA: Are we good to leave?

MATT: "I don't do the
whole council thing,

3442
02:39:30,367 --> 02:39:34,501
but they assure me it's fine,
Allie's gonna know what to do.

3443
02:39:34,534 --> 02:39:38,167
I just--this is
really depressing me."

3444

LAURA: I look at Daxio, is everything
okay, can we cut out--

3445
02:39:44,167 --> 02:39:45,701
MATT: He's in the middle
of a conversation.

3446
02:39:45,734 --> 02:39:48,000
"Yes, yes, we've got it covered.

3447
02:39:48,033 --> 02:39:49,667
Let Allura know
as soon as she can,

3448
02:39:49,701 --> 02:39:53,067
come to us, we have
a lot to discuss."

3449
02:39:53,100 --> 02:39:55,501
-LAURA: Will do.
-MATT: "Everyone, thank you."

3450
02:39:55,534 --> 02:39:56,934
-LAURA: Thank you.
-MATT: "And from me,

3451
02:39:56,968 --> 02:40:00,300
from all the civilians
of the city,

3452
02:40:00,334 --> 02:40:03,567
from Tal'Dorei proper,

3453
02:40:03,601 --> 02:40:06,200
we all owe you a great
debt of gratitude."

3454
02:40:06,234 --> 02:40:08,400
LAURA: Thank you for having our back.

3455
02:40:08,434 --> 02:40:10,734
MATT: "Thank you for having ours.

3456

Now, off with you, you
know where to find us."

get you back to Allie.

3458
02:40:15,197 --> 02:40:18,400
-MARISHA: We gotta find a tree.
-SAM: Might I just--

3459
02:40:18,434 --> 02:40:20,601
-TALIESIN: We have a tree at the keep.
-MARISHA: We do have a tree at the keep

3460
02:40:20,634 --> 02:40:22,000
if we wanted to make
a stop at the keep.

3461
02:40:22,033 --> 02:40:25,133
SAM: So we are now
stiffing The Clasp.

3462
02:40:25,167 --> 02:40:26,400
-LAURA: No.
-TALIESIN: No.

3463
02:40:26,434 --> 02:40:28,501
LAURA: By the way, Daxio...

3464
02:40:28,534 --> 02:40:31,000
(laughing)

3465
02:40:31,033 --> 02:40:33,067
I'm sure you're aware, but--

3466
02:40:33,100 --> 02:40:35,667
and we'll let Allura
know as well--The Clasp

3467
02:40:35,701 --> 02:40:39,367
was instrumental in keeping
survivors alive here in Emon.

3468
02:40:39,400 --> 02:40:43,367
-They definitely deserve a bit of the pot.
-TALIESIN: Compensation.

3469
02:40:43,400 --> 02:40:46,901
-SAM: Handsome reward.
-MATT: "We'll discuss with them.

3470
02:40:46,934 --> 02:40:50,300
I do believe that we've already
had a few conversations

3471
02:40:50,334 --> 02:40:53,701
with a few operatives during
our arrival within the city,

3472
02:40:53,734 --> 02:40:56,567
and they've been
very forthcoming

3473
02:40:56,601 --> 02:41:01,200
with information,
and willing to aid us.

3474
02:41:01,234 --> 02:41:05,701
So, yes, I appreciate
the acknowledgement."

3475
02:41:05,734 --> 02:41:08,501
LAURA: We wouldn't have made
it here without them.

3476
02:41:08,534 --> 02:41:12,534
SAM: Please let them know
that we vouched for them.

3477
02:41:12,567 --> 02:41:16,033
LIAM: They've at least earned
the old status quo.

3478
02:41:16,067 --> 02:41:17,434
-TRAVIS: What is that?
-MATT: "Very well."

3479
02:41:17,467 --> 02:41:20,000
LAURA: I have no idea.

3480
02:41:20,033 --> 02:41:22,400
PATRICK: And just to mention,

3481
02:41:22,434 --> 02:41:25,334
if you take people like that

3482
02:41:25,367 --> 02:41:29,534
and give them, in a place

3483
02:41:29,567 --> 02:41:32,968
in your town,

3484
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:36,567
you can keep an eye on them.

3485
02:41:36,601 --> 02:41:40,067
MATT: He eyes kinda narrow a little
bit, he nods towards you.

3486
02:41:40,100 --> 02:41:43,234
"Indeed.

3487
02:41:43,267 --> 02:41:46,133
Well, I'll take it from here.

3488
02:41:46,167 --> 02:41:48,934
Return when you can.

3489
02:41:48,968 --> 02:41:50,801
Get Allura back to us,

3490
02:41:50,834 --> 02:41:54,267
and stay safe."

3491
02:41:54,300 --> 02:41:58,367
And he turns back to
handle some more business.

3492
02:41:58,400 --> 02:41:59,901
What do you guys wanna do?

3493
02:41:59,934 --> 02:42:02,801
-TRAVIS: Make for Greyskull Keep--
-LAURA: Where our giant tree is

3494
02:42:02,834 --> 02:42:05,267
so we can go to
our other giant tree.

3495
02:42:05,300 --> 02:42:08,033
-MATT: Okay.
-MARISHA: What they said.

3496
02:42:08,067 --> 02:42:10,763
MATT: You guys make your
way walking southward

3497
02:42:10,763 --> 02:42:13,000
through Emon, and--

3498
02:42:13,033 --> 02:42:15,734
LAURA: Just loot everything
along the way, like--

3499
02:42:15,767 --> 02:42:18,801
-MARISHA: Just like decking children.
-LAURA: Every person you see.

3500
02:42:18,834 --> 02:42:22,501
(crosstalk)

3501
02:42:22,534 --> 02:42:26,634
LIAM: Matt starts rolling
random encounters.

3502
02:42:26,667 --> 02:42:29,200
MATT: Six episodes just
getting out of Emon.

3503
02:42:29,234 --> 02:42:31,367
(laughing)

3504
02:42:31,400 --> 02:42:34,300
TRAVIS: Why the hell did we walk?

3505
02:42:34,334 --> 02:42:37,133
MATT: You guys make your way
through, and as you do,

3506
02:42:37,167 --> 02:42:40,133
it's, it's an emotional journey,

3507
02:42:40,167 --> 02:42:43,734
because as you walk through
the city that became your home

3508
02:42:43,767 --> 02:42:46,968
as you all became a family,

3509
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:48,767
you can see familiar sights,

3510
02:42:48,801 --> 02:42:53,067
you can see familiar
thoroughfares,

3511
02:42:53,100 --> 02:42:57,167
and streetsides, and taverns,

3512
02:42:57,200 --> 02:42:59,400
many of which have
sustained severe damage,

3513
02:42:59,434 --> 02:43:03,067
many that have been reduced
to nothing but rubble and ash.

3514
02:43:03,100 --> 02:43:04,968
And some that still
stand defiantly

3515
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:08,267
versus all the
difficulty, and stress,

3516
02:43:08,300 --> 02:43:12,601
and strenuous struggle
that has existed

3517
02:43:12,634 --> 02:43:15,601
for weeks and weeks
and weeks here.

3518
02:43:15,634 --> 02:43:17,767
You see people slowly
emerging from the shadows

3519
02:43:17,801 --> 02:43:20,501
to try and reclaim what
remains of their life,

3520
02:43:20,534 --> 02:43:22,133
but you also see them
helping each other.

3521
02:43:22,167 --> 02:43:26,234
You also see a comparison

3522
02:43:26,267 --> 02:43:29,000
between the busy bustle

3523
02:43:29,033 --> 02:43:31,334
and kind of general
selfish lifestyle

3524
02:43:31,367 --> 02:43:34,734
that most people in a well-off
capital city exist in

3525
02:43:34,767 --> 02:43:37,767
replaced with a newly
understood sense of kinship

3526
02:43:37,801 --> 02:43:40,133
and looking out for each other.

3527
02:43:40,167 --> 02:43:43,067
You see the guards
themselves beginning

3528
02:43:43,100 --> 02:43:47,334
to really understand,

3529
02:43:47,367 --> 02:43:49,467
in their lifetime,
the first true,

3530
02:43:49,501 --> 02:43:51,968
large-scale victory
for the betterment

3531
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:54,167
of their people and
what that means to them.

3532
02:43:54,200 --> 02:43:58,300
And there's kinda
a sense of pride

3533
02:43:58,334 --> 02:44:00,734
through the sadness that
many of the armed soldiers

3534
02:44:00,767 --> 02:44:03,400
you've come across
probably never had.

3535
02:44:03,434 --> 02:44:06,334
♪

3536
02:44:06,367 --> 02:44:08,334
It gives you hope,

3537
02:44:08,367 --> 02:44:10,434
though to see it in
such a state in itself

3538
02:44:10,467 --> 02:44:14,567
is harrowing in its own right.

3539
02:44:14,601 --> 02:44:16,801
You can already begin to
see through this energy

3540
02:44:16,834 --> 02:44:20,167
and through the
slow crawling return

3541
02:44:20,200 --> 02:44:24,133
to life that you've
helped ensure

3542
02:44:24,167 --> 02:44:27,267
that Emon still has a future,

3543
02:44:27,300 --> 02:44:30,018
let alone Tal'Dorei itself.

3544
02:44:30,018 --> 02:44:32,834
No one catches your
attention as you leave,

3545
02:44:32,868 --> 02:44:36,667
but a number of eyes train
onto you as you exit.

3546
02:44:36,701 --> 02:44:39,501
And many of them flash
with recognition,

3547
02:44:39,534 --> 02:44:42,534
their face going bright,

3548
02:44:42,567 --> 02:44:46,667
and then with just a solemn nod

3549
02:44:46,701 --> 02:44:49,801
of, "Thank you."

3550
02:44:49,834 --> 02:44:52,767
Eventually you find yourself
to the southern gates of Emon

3551
02:44:52,801 --> 02:44:57,000
exiting out into the charred
fields that once were green

3552
02:44:57,033 --> 02:45:01,601
and lush with grain and grass.

3553
02:45:01,634 --> 02:45:04,667
Eventually coming upon the
exterior of Greyskull Keep,

3554
02:45:04,701 --> 02:45:07,167
the home of Vox Machina.

3555
02:45:07,200 --> 02:45:11,000
Just as you left it, abandoned,
the front gate partially ajar.

3556
02:45:11,033 --> 02:45:12,934
There stands the keep.

3557
02:45:12,968 --> 02:45:15,100
Mighty, defiant,

3558
02:45:15,133 --> 02:45:18,367
and somewhere there is a jar
of no-longer-magical poop.

3559
02:45:18,400 --> 02:45:21,267
(laughing)

3560
02:45:21,300 --> 02:45:23,634
Making your way inside, there
is the garden that you left

3561
02:45:23,667 --> 02:45:25,801
within the Temple to Sarenrae

3562
02:45:25,834 --> 02:45:27,801
and the large central
tree that you use

3563
02:45:27,834 --> 02:45:30,734
for most of your transport
to and from, Keyleth.

3564
02:45:30,767 --> 02:45:34,467
-MARISHA: How's the garden look?
-MATT: Looks as good as you left it.

3565
02:45:34,501 --> 02:45:36,467
It was far enough from
the battle to where

3566
02:45:36,501 --> 02:45:38,901
it didn't seem to suffer
any sort of blows or issues.

3567
02:45:38,934 --> 02:45:41,200
You guys managed to basically
focus everything within

3568
02:45:41,234 --> 02:45:44,834
the city's walls, so,
good on you for that.

3569
02:45:47,734 --> 02:45:50,234
MARISHA: Okay, anybody need anything?

3570
02:45:50,267 --> 02:45:52,133
SAM: Not gonna go through the--

3571
02:45:52,167 --> 02:45:54,467
need anything from
your rooms or anything?

3572
02:45:54,501 --> 02:45:57,267
-LAURA: We'll be back here.
-SAM: Change of underwear?

3573
02:45:57,300 --> 02:46:00,968
-TRAVIS: What's that?
-LAURA: It's all at Whitestone.

3574
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:03,033
We have everyone with us.

3575
02:46:03,067 --> 02:46:05,133
Jarrett, Kash, Zahra.

3576
02:46:05,167 --> 02:46:07,901
MATT: They've all kinda
walked along with you.

3577
02:46:07,934 --> 02:46:09,734
LIAM: I'm just gonna
pluck another flower

3578
02:46:09,767 --> 02:46:12,033
and tuck it behind my ear.

3579
02:46:12,067 --> 02:46:15,200
MATT: Okay.

3580
02:46:15,234 --> 02:46:17,534
As Keyleth steps forward
and places her hands

3581
02:46:17,567 --> 02:46:19,868
across the base of
the tree, she focuses

3582
02:46:19,901 --> 02:46:23,601
and it's almost like
grasping two ends of a bag

3583
02:46:23,634 --> 02:46:26,534
and then pulling it open
with alternating zippers.

3584
02:46:26,567 --> 02:46:30,033
You watch the bark split,
and as it opens up

3585
02:46:30,067 --> 02:46:33,434
and crawls from floor
to the seven-foot apex,

3586
02:46:33,467 --> 02:46:36,234
a doorway is opened temporarily,
and on the other side

3587
02:46:36,267 --> 02:46:39,734
you immediately see the,

3588
02:46:39,767 --> 02:46:43,400
the slow morning sun
beginning to rise

3589
02:46:43,434 --> 02:46:47,033
in Whitestone across the city.

3590
02:46:47,067 --> 02:46:50,834
-SAM: Jump in.
-MARISHA: Six seconds, go, go, go!

3591
02:46:50,868 --> 02:46:52,667
MATT: You all go charging through
as fast as you can,

3592
02:46:52,701 --> 02:46:54,601
all emerging into the center

3593
02:46:54,634 --> 02:46:57,968
of Whitestone's central area,

3594
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:01,801
the twilight being slowly
cast away by the rising sun.

3595
02:47:01,834 --> 02:47:05,501
The Sun Tree at your back as
the doorway closes behind you,

3596
02:47:05,534 --> 02:47:09,000
and the cold air

3597
02:47:09,033 --> 02:47:10,501
immediately catches your lungs.

3598
02:47:10,534 --> 02:47:14,267
You've been amongst
the heat and the clouds

3599
02:47:14,300 --> 02:47:18,434
of smoke and soot
of Emon for so long

3600
02:47:18,467 --> 02:47:22,133
amongst the struggle,
the cold crisp air is almost

3601
02:47:22,167 --> 02:47:25,968
a welcome moment of respite
from that experience.

3602
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:28,033
You look around you and
the little bits of grass

3603
02:47:28,067 --> 02:47:31,968
have broken the cobblestone
and floor of the open area,

3604
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:35,868
have bits of frozen dew
across their surface,

3605
02:47:35,901 --> 02:47:39,000
and it's this beautiful
crystal moment

3606
02:47:39,033 --> 02:47:42,901
of peace that you didn't realize

3607
02:47:42,934 --> 02:47:46,267
you've been seeking
for quite some time.

3608
02:47:46,300 --> 02:47:48,801
You can see the gentle bit
of light beginning to crest

3609
02:47:48,834 --> 02:47:51,701
over the mountains, hitting
Castle Whitestone ahead of you.

3610
02:47:51,734 --> 02:47:54,033
You've returned.

3611

Not too large, but enough

You've never been to Whitestone,

3664
02:50:15,300 --> 02:50:18,234
You watch as a woman in her--
what you can only imagine

3665
02:50:18,267 --> 02:50:22,133
to be late teens,
early twenties physically,

3666
02:50:22,167 --> 02:50:26,734
but her eyes carry
the wisdom that only

3667
02:50:26,767 --> 02:50:31,267
years of trauma
and survival can hold.

3668
02:50:31,300 --> 02:50:33,667
Her dark brunette hair with
a single shock of white

3669
02:50:33,701 --> 02:50:35,400
that kind of curls to the back.

3670
02:50:35,434 --> 02:50:39,267
Walks in, consciousness--

3671
02:50:39,300 --> 02:50:41,467
as much as you could
expect from a girl

3672
02:50:41,501 --> 02:50:44,601
that early in the morning.

3673
02:50:44,634 --> 02:50:47,767
Has her hands kinda
clasped at her chest.

3674
02:50:47,801 --> 02:50:52,300
"Well, um, back
so soon, are we?"

3675
02:50:52,334 --> 02:50:55,067
MARISHA: Is it soon?

3676
02:50:55,100 --> 02:50:58,300
It feels like we've been--
at least two weeks.

3677
02:50:58,334 --> 02:51:00,434
(sighing)

3678
02:51:00,467 --> 02:51:03,968
(laughing)

3679
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:06,234
LIAM: More like five.

3680
02:51:06,267 --> 02:51:08,300
MARISHA: That's true.

3681
02:51:08,334 --> 02:51:09,934
Like a holiday break happened.

3682
02:51:09,968 --> 02:51:12,667
LAURA: Thordak is dead.

3683
02:51:12,701 --> 02:51:14,934
MATT: "Then it is done,
I'm proud of you all."

3684
02:51:14,968 --> 02:51:18,033
-LAURA: It's not done.
-LIAM: It's not done.

3685
02:51:18,067 --> 02:51:21,501
TALIESIN: But it's a victory.

3686
02:51:21,534 --> 02:51:25,367
-We've had a good day.
-MARISHA: We're not dead.

3687
02:51:25,400 --> 02:51:28,501
MATT: "I can see that,
and I'm quite thankful.

3688
02:51:28,534 --> 02:51:31,934
Um, your friend, I don't
believe I've had the honor."

3689
02:51:31,968 --> 02:51:35,868
-MARISHA: Oh yeah, this is Ker.
-PATRICK: Am I still like--

3690
02:51:35,901 --> 02:51:39,501
do I look like Brian Blessed
who's just been through,

3691
02:51:39,534 --> 02:51:42,567
like, a bloody fucking massacre?

3692
02:51:42,601 --> 02:51:44,901
-Am I still like--
-MATT: All of you do.

3693
02:51:44,934 --> 02:51:48,801
All of you right now
are just wrecked.

3694
02:51:48,834 --> 02:51:52,400
-PATRICK: Okay.
-MATT: Like still,

3695
02:51:52,434 --> 02:51:54,801
still shiny from
like oils and sweat.

3696
02:51:54,834 --> 02:51:59,033
There's still like
smeared ash and--

3697
02:51:59,067 --> 02:52:03,067
PATRICK: It's probably not until
right then where I'm like,

3698
02:52:03,100 --> 02:52:06,300
I am, I am a fucking mess.

3699
02:52:06,334 --> 02:52:10,501
I'm like up to
elbows bloody, yeah.

3700
02:52:10,534 --> 02:52:13,601
-TALIESIN: You fit right in here.
-PATRICK: Yeah, okay.

3701
02:52:13,634 --> 02:52:15,701
MATT: "I've not had the pleasure."

3702
02:52:15,734 --> 02:52:17,601
PATRICK: Ker, it's a pleasure
to meet you.

3703
02:52:17,634 --> 02:52:19,868
LAURA: How did you know we
were here, Cassandra?

3704
02:52:19,901 --> 02:52:23,868
MATT: "The guards went
and summoned me.

3705
02:52:23,901 --> 02:52:26,200
To be perfectly honest,
I don't usually rouse

3706
02:52:26,234 --> 02:52:30,000
so early in the morning,
but this is good news.

3707
02:52:30,033 --> 02:52:31,934
And to be perfectly honest,
the last few times

3708
02:52:31,968 --> 02:52:33,467
the guards have summoned
me with your arrival,

3709
02:52:33,501 --> 02:52:35,868
they've been with
a bit of a scare.

3710
02:52:35,901 --> 02:52:39,300
So, um, it's an absolute
pleasure to make

3711
02:52:39,334 --> 02:52:42,467
your acquaintance, Ker,
you are welcome here.

3712
02:52:42,501 --> 02:52:45,801
Any friends of my friends
are a friend of mine."

3713
02:52:45,834 --> 02:52:49,100
LAURA: Can we roll an insight check
to see if it's really her?

3714
02:52:49,133 --> 02:52:50,601
-LIAM: Sure.
-MATT: Sure, roll an insight check.

3715
02:52:50,634 --> 02:52:53,667
-LAURA: I don't trust anybody now.
-TRAVIS: Me too, it was my idea.

3716
02:52:53,701 --> 02:52:57,133
LIAM: You've burned us too
many times, Matt.

3717
02:52:57,167 --> 02:53:00,968
-LAURA: Twenty-five.
-LIAM: She's a beholder.

3718
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:02,767
TRAVIS: Four.

3719
02:53:02,801 --> 02:53:06,167
(laughing)

3720
02:53:06,200 --> 02:53:08,200
-LAURA: This is just a ruse.
-SAM: Secrets!

3721
02:53:08,234 --> 02:53:11,734
LAURA: It's not gonna be Raishan.

3722
02:53:11,767 --> 02:53:14,767
(laughing)

3723
02:53:19,734 --> 02:53:22,234
Go team.

3724
02:53:22,267 --> 02:53:25,267
MATT: Suddenly suffers how much psychic damage?

3725
02:53:29,567 --> 02:53:32,033
-SAM: Vex.
-LAURA: Huh?

3726
02:53:32,067 --> 02:53:34,734
Do you think this would be my
reaction if it was Raishan?

3727
02:53:34,767 --> 02:53:37,367
(laughing)

3728
02:53:37,400 --> 02:53:40,834
MATT: "Well, rest."

3729
02:53:40,868 --> 02:53:43,634
TALIESIN: Have a bit a of drink,
we're going to rest, and then--

3730
02:53:43,667 --> 02:53:46,934
MATT: "Well, you know where
we keep the wine."

3731
02:53:46,968 --> 02:53:49,601
LAURA: ♪ Bloody Marys ♪

3732
02:53:49,634 --> 02:53:52,467
♪ Mimosas ♪♪

3733
02:53:52,501 --> 02:53:54,701
MATT: "Are we expecting more
or is it just you?"

3734
02:53:54,734 --> 02:53:58,100
-TALIESIN: Did Vex just do that?
-SAM: It's just us for now.

3735
02:53:58,133 --> 02:54:01,590
-I think--
-TRAVIS: It's just us, yeah.

3736
02:54:01,590 --> 02:54:04,200
SAM: They never gave our
airship any instructions.

3737
02:54:04,234 --> 02:54:08,234
I guess it's just
roaming the countryside.

3738
02:54:08,267 --> 02:54:11,334
TRAVIS: It's just us this time, I know
we usually have a lot in tow--

3739
02:54:11,367 --> 02:54:13,734
SAM: Oh, and we don't need to--
well, do we need to keep

3740
02:54:13,767 --> 02:54:15,734
the force field up
around the city anymore?

3741
02:54:15,767 --> 02:54:19,067
TALIESIN: No, everything's--we can
stand down at this point.

3742
02:54:19,100 --> 02:54:21,734
It's time for everything
to rest briefly.

3743
02:54:21,767 --> 02:54:24,834
-LAURA: We need to wake Allura.
-TALIESIN: We do need to wake Allura.

3744
02:54:24,868 --> 02:54:27,400
MATT: "All right, I'll
have her roused.

3745
02:54:27,434 --> 02:54:30,200
The rest of you, if you wish,
I could have baths drawn.

3746
02:54:30,234 --> 02:54:32,968
I think you could use it."

3747
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:36,601
-TALIESIN: What are you trying to imply?
-MATT: "Brother."

3748
02:54:36,634 --> 02:54:39,067
TALIESIN: I know, I know,
you owe me--I owe one.

3749
02:54:39,100 --> 02:54:42,033
LIAM: You don't like
Dragon Age splatter?

3750
02:54:42,067 --> 02:54:45,534
(laughing)

3751
02:54:45,567 --> 02:54:47,434
TRAVIS: Paintbrush of gore.

3752
02:54:47,467 --> 02:54:51,267
MATT: "I mean no disrespect,
but as a lady

3753
02:54:51,300 --> 02:54:55,100
of esteemed blood, you
are all a terrible mess."

3754
02:54:55,133 --> 02:54:59,701
TALIESIN: I am going to walk right up
to her, give her a big hug.

3755
02:54:59,734 --> 02:55:02,434
MATT: "No, no, no, no!"

3756
02:55:02,467 --> 02:55:04,964
And for a second, for
a second you see a glimmer

3757
02:55:04,964 --> 02:55:07,767
of the young sister
that grew up with Percy

3758
02:55:07,801 --> 02:55:10,934
fighting him off,
and she pushes him off.

3759
02:55:10,968 --> 02:55:13,834
(laughing)

3760
02:55:13,868 --> 02:55:16,400
"Thank you."

3761
02:55:16,434 --> 02:55:20,667
TALIESIN: I am going to be owed for much
more than that, I'm well aware.

3762
02:55:20,701 --> 02:55:23,234
MATT: "Yes, yes, you are.

3763
02:55:23,267 --> 02:55:25,834
-I'm glad you're back."
-TALIESIN: It's good to be home.

3764
02:55:25,868 --> 02:55:28,734
MATT: "All right, I'll have
Allura brought to you.

3765
02:55:28,767 --> 02:55:31,400
Rest well, should you
require anything, I'll be

3766
02:55:31,434 --> 02:55:35,367
in my chambers
waking properly."

3767
02:55:35,400 --> 02:55:37,067
She leaves the room.

♪

3769
02:55:40,300 --> 02:55:43,133
Though you had--brought
little scraps of food

3770
02:55:43,167 --> 02:55:45,300
as they were available,
a full breakfast meal

3771

just being cleaned properly.

TALIESIN: We're spying, we're spying.

singed short again.

ways with Jarrett,

3777
02:56:03,100 --> 02:56:06,434
I'd like to pull him
aside a little bit.

3778
02:56:06,467 --> 02:56:08,901
MATT: As you pull Jarrett aside,
you get but a few steps away

3779
02:56:08,934 --> 02:56:10,767
and he goes, "I'm
not doing it again."

SAM: I know, I know.

I just wanted to thank
you for your efforts,

and, you know, it really
meant a lot to me,

3783
02:56:20,200 --> 02:56:23,734
and I'm gonna cast
an eighth level

3784
02:56:23,767 --> 02:56:26,267
modify memory on you.

eighth level spell?

(laughing)

3789
02:56:36,133 --> 02:56:38,310
LAURA: You have an eighth
level spell left?

3790
02:56:38,310 --> 02:56:41,767
SAM: Yeah.

MATT: Okay, okay.

LAURA: I don't even feel
bad that he died now.

3794
02:56:49,567 --> 02:56:52,133
MATT: Is this through the hand cone,
because that's a whole--

3795
02:56:52,167 --> 02:56:54,400
-that's not subtle.
-SAM: No, it would not be subtle,

3796
02:56:54,434 --> 02:56:57,267
-so I cannot do the hand cone.
-MATT: That's okay, he rolled a five.

3797
02:56:57,300 --> 02:57:00,167
So, what are you modifying?

3798
02:57:00,200 --> 02:57:04,701
SAM: When he delivered
the suude to me,

3799
02:57:04,734 --> 02:57:07,734
I thanked him for it
and I went into a--

3800
02:57:07,767 --> 02:57:10,067
I'm implanting this
memory in his head.

3801
02:57:10,100 --> 02:57:12,501
I told him why I
needed it so badly,

3802
02:57:12,534 --> 02:57:15,167
and it was a very sad tale

3803
02:57:15,200 --> 02:57:18,400
of how a goblin killed my
mother and the image haunts me

3804
02:57:18,434 --> 02:57:21,767
to this day and I can't
get through a night--

3805
02:57:21,801 --> 02:57:25,567
I can't function without
some sort of sustenance.

3806
02:57:25,601 --> 02:57:29,701
He felt terrible for me and
vowed to get me more, much more.

3807
02:57:29,734 --> 02:57:31,767
(laughing)

3808
02:57:31,801 --> 02:57:34,367
And at that time,

3809
02:57:34,400 --> 02:57:37,434
I gave him 50 platinum.

3810
02:57:37,467 --> 02:57:40,701
TRAVIS: Holy shit, you're
turning into a drug lord.

3811
02:57:40,734 --> 02:57:45,067

now, because I gave it to him.

3812

enemy, oh my god.

3813
02:57:48,167 --> 02:57:50,434
-MARISHA: You're going full Heisenberg.
-SAM: And he feels for me.

3814
02:57:50,467 --> 02:57:53,634
-TRAVIS: He is Heisenberg.
-TALIESIN: He is the one that knocks.

3815
02:57:53,667 --> 02:57:57,067
(laughing)

3816
02:57:57,100 --> 02:57:59,100
(crosstalk)

3817
02:58:01,234 --> 02:58:04,133
SAM: I broke down and he's never
seen me break down like that.

3818
02:58:04,167 --> 02:58:06,033
-MATT: No, he hasn't.
-SAM: In his mind anyway.

3819
02:58:06,067 --> 02:58:08,534

-TALIESIN: Wow!

3820
02:58:08,567 --> 02:58:11,667
-TRAVIS: Outstanding.
-TALIESIN: I can't--what?

3822
02:58:13,901 --> 02:58:16,601
MATT: All right, and at which
point you watch as his eyes

3823
02:58:16,634 --> 02:58:19,094
kind of glaze over for a moment.

3824
02:58:19,094 --> 02:58:22,000
He was about to make his way
towards getting his own shower.

3825
02:58:22,033 --> 02:58:24,901
He let everybody else go first,
and he kinda stops for a second

3826
02:58:24,934 --> 02:58:28,200
and his eyes glaze over, and
he kinda blinks for a second.

3827
02:58:28,234 --> 02:58:31,100
"Well, I understand these
have been very trying days.

3828
02:58:31,133 --> 02:58:34,300
If there's anything I can
do to help, let me know."

3829
02:58:34,334 --> 02:58:36,334
SAM: You know how to help.

3830
02:58:36,367 --> 02:58:39,334
(laughing)

3831
02:58:39,367 --> 02:58:42,234
MATT: And you see the look in his
eyes that you've seen before,

3832
02:58:42,267 --> 02:58:45,367
which is the, I don't do this,

3833
02:58:45,400 --> 02:58:47,601
I barely know how to do this,

3834
02:58:47,634 --> 02:58:50,367
and the connections I have,

3835
02:58:50,400 --> 02:58:52,901
it's, it's gonna be hard.

3836
02:58:52,934 --> 02:58:55,234
And you see this look, but
as opposed--where previously

3837
02:58:55,267 --> 02:58:57,367
it was, I can't
do this anymore.

3838
02:58:57,400 --> 02:58:59,901
He goes--he reaches up,
touches your shoulder and goes,

3839
02:58:59,934 --> 02:59:02,133
"I'll do what I can."

3840
02:59:02,167 --> 02:59:04,167
SAM: That's all I ask.

3841
02:59:04,200 --> 02:59:06,367
LIAM: Yeah, Mr. Shorthalt, yeah.

-MARISHA: What the fuck?

3843
02:59:09,767 --> 02:59:12,300
SAM: Rest well, Jarrett, thank
you for your brave battle.

3844
02:59:12,334 --> 02:59:16,000
MARISHA: Oh my god, oh my god.

3845
02:59:16,033 --> 02:59:20,534
MATT: "Just so you know, I'm
expecting a raise, 'cause, uh,

3846
02:59:20,567 --> 02:59:23,601
I kinda almost died like twice.

3847

3848
02:59:25,067 --> 02:59:26,734

3849
02:59:26,767 --> 02:59:27,948
I did.

3850
02:59:30,000 --> 02:59:32,067
MATT: "I'll see what I can do."

3851
02:59:32,100 --> 02:59:34,334
Then he goes and
leaves to take a bath.

3852
02:59:34,367 --> 02:59:36,267
LIAM: We were all taking baths, right?

3853
02:59:36,300 --> 02:59:39,367
And they're like big royal baths
'cause this is Whitestone?

3854
02:59:39,400 --> 02:59:42,000
MATT: Yeah, there's maybe four
at any given point in time.

3855
02:59:42,033 --> 02:59:44,100
So you guys still have
to kinda take turns.

LIAM: Excellent, I take
mine very quickly,

3857
02:59:47,968 --> 02:59:52,167
and walk in the buck, and
I find Percival's bath,

3858
02:59:52,200 --> 02:59:54,901
and silently walk
in while he's bathing,

03:04:38,041 --> 03:04:39,667
And it's been a while
since you've had

3967
03:04:39,701 --> 03:04:41,033
this type of brotherhood.

3968
03:04:41,067 --> 03:04:43,494
And even though you're quiet
amongst their chatter,

3969
03:04:43,494 --> 03:04:46,033
and they are a family
that you're outside of,

3970
03:04:46,067 --> 03:04:47,868
you can't fight the smile.

3971
03:04:47,901 --> 03:04:50,033
PATRICK: Oh, no, it's--this is--

3972
03:04:50,067 --> 03:04:52,667
and actually it's, you know,

3973
03:04:52,701 --> 03:04:56,467
it's very nice to watch
like, you know--

3974
03:04:56,501 --> 03:04:59,701
It did not stay
like this for me,

3975
03:04:59,734 --> 03:05:02,267
and it's obviously
staying like this for them.

3976
03:05:02,300 --> 03:05:04,534
And so, yeah, I'm very happy.

3977
03:05:04,567 --> 03:05:08,200
And honestly,
if there is liquor here,

3978
03:05:08,234 --> 03:05:10,734
I probably do not stay
very quiet for long.

3979
03:05:10,767 --> 03:05:13,868
(laughing)

3980
03:05:13,901 --> 03:05:15,033
LAURA: So much liquor.

3981
03:05:15,067 --> 03:05:16,701
MATT: Breakfast wine!

3982
03:05:18,834 --> 03:05:20,234
TALIESIN: One of my Brit friends--

3983
03:05:20,267 --> 03:05:22,267
actually, were you at
that breakfast at Comic Con

3984
03:05:22,300 --> 03:05:23,501
where we went to the pub

3985
03:05:23,534 --> 03:05:24,968
and he said, Do you have
any breakfast beer?

3986
03:05:25,000 --> 03:05:26,934
What do you have on
the breakfast beer menu?

3987
03:05:26,968 --> 03:05:28,400
TRAVIS: Yeah, if Ker
is with the liquor

3988
03:05:28,434 --> 03:05:29,901
and not being quiet,

3989
03:05:29,934 --> 03:05:32,000
-I'm probably with him.
-MATT: All right, well,

3990
03:05:32,033 --> 03:05:36,968
you watch as Ker comes back
with two bottles

3991
03:05:37,000 --> 03:05:40,727
after being given directions
as to where the...

3992
03:05:40,727 --> 03:05:41,667
(bottle pops)

3993
03:05:41,667 --> 03:05:42,901
Just like that.

3994
03:05:42,934 --> 03:05:45,033
(laughing)

3995
03:05:46,968 --> 03:05:49,934
A bottle in each hand,
and each of you grab a bottle,

3996
03:05:49,968 --> 03:05:53,467
and kinda toast
the bottle itself.

3997
03:05:53,501 --> 03:05:55,144
You're gonna drink.

3998
03:05:55,144 --> 03:05:56,868
Is there anything
you guys wanna discuss

3999
03:05:56,901 --> 03:05:58,637
while you're having breakfast?

4000
03:05:59,901 --> 03:06:01,501
TRAVIS: We're not worried
about the spinning

4001
03:06:01,534 --> 03:06:02,801
dirt button of death, right?

4002
03:06:02,834 --> 03:06:05,000
It's fine down there,
like it's--

4003
03:06:05,033 --> 03:06:06,400
TALIESIN: I think it's on the list,

4004
03:06:06,434 --> 03:06:09,634
but we have a list,
we can slow down a bit.

4005
03:06:09,667 --> 03:06:12,934
SAM: What is our list,
'cause, I mean--

4006
03:06:12,968 --> 03:06:15,234
so here's what
I got on my list.

4007
03:06:15,267 --> 03:06:16,601
It's not very long.

4008
03:06:16,634 --> 03:06:19,434
Bury a hand in Vasselheim.

4009
03:06:19,467 --> 03:06:21,534
LAURA: No, bury ashes in Vasselheim.

4010
03:06:21,567 --> 03:06:22,601
SAM: Oh, what was the hand?

4011
03:06:22,634 --> 03:06:24,667
LAURA: The hand was return the hand.

4012
03:06:24,701 --> 03:06:26,467
SAM: Oh, return the hand to Marquet.

4013
03:06:26,501 --> 03:06:27,667
MARISHA: Marquet, yeah.

4014
03:06:27,701 --> 03:06:32,443
-SAM: Return hand...Marquet.
-PATRICK: An actual hand.

4015
03:06:32,443 --> 03:06:34,400
I don't need to know,
I just wanted to see

4016
03:06:34,434 --> 03:06:38,334
-if I was doing it right.
-SAM: Bury ashes in Vasselheim.

4017
03:06:38,367 --> 03:06:41,400
-Find Opash, go to--
-TALIESIN: Island of Opash.

4018
03:06:41,434 --> 03:06:44,033
-SAM: Go to Wildmount.
-LAURA: Both, yes.

4019
03:06:44,067 --> 03:06:46,434
-SAM: Is that the same thing?
-LAURA: No.

4020
03:06:46,467 --> 03:06:49,467
SAM: Well, what--which one do we do?

4021
03:06:49,501 --> 03:06:51,167
LAURA: Well, Vasselheim is--

4022
03:06:51,200 --> 03:06:53,601
is Vasselheim north--
close to Wildmount?

4023
03:06:53,634 --> 03:06:55,200
-TALIESIN:Nothing is north--
-MATT: No, opposite side.

4024
03:06:55,234 --> 03:06:58,901
-LAURA: Oh, well, shit.
-MATT: Vasselheim's to the northwest.

4025
03:06:58,934 --> 03:07:02,734
Wildmount is the east--
northeast of Tal'Dorei.

4026
03:07:02,767 --> 03:07:05,467
TRAVIS: We may find more
about Opash in Wildmount.

4027
03:07:05,501 --> 03:07:07,901
LAURA: Zahra's from Wildmount.

4028
03:07:07,934 --> 03:07:08,934
MATT: Uhh.

4029
03:07:08,968 --> 03:07:11,067
-TRAVIS: Is she?
-LAURA: Originally, I think.

4030
03:07:11,100 --> 03:07:12,801
MATT: Maybe--you'd have
to check with Zahra.

4031
03:07:12,834 --> 03:07:15,801
LAURA: I think she is--when she told me
her history, I think it was.

4032
03:07:15,834 --> 03:07:17,033
MATT: Sure, there we go.

4033
03:07:17,067 --> 03:07:19,400
TRAVIS: What else is on your list?

4034
03:07:19,434 --> 03:07:21,834
-SAM: Uh--
-LAURA: Ooh, and the boys!

4035
03:07:21,868 --> 03:07:23,734
The boys.

4036
03:07:23,767 --> 03:07:25,200
SAM: Oh, the little boys!

4037
03:07:25,234 --> 03:07:28,300
LAURA: Yeah, the little angel babies,
they're from Wildmount.

4038
03:07:28,334 --> 03:07:29,834
SAM: Where are they--
where did we leave them?

4039
03:07:29,868 --> 03:07:31,834
-LAURA: They're here.
-SAM: Oh, okay.

4040
03:07:31,868 --> 03:07:34,000
TRAVIS: Where did we leave them?

4041
03:07:34,033 --> 03:07:35,634
TALIESIN: On the side of the road.

4042
03:07:35,667 --> 03:07:37,400
SAM: Any other to-do list items?

4043
03:07:37,434 --> 03:07:39,501
TALIESIN: We have a demon.

4044
03:07:39,534 --> 03:07:41,400
LAURA: Oh, God, we have Hotis,

4045
03:07:41,434 --> 03:07:46,300
and the other demon that
we fought in the City of Brass.

4046
03:07:46,334 --> 03:07:50,400
LIAM: We've got time on that--
how long has it been Hotis-wise?

4047
03:07:50,434 --> 03:07:53,934
MATT: Hotis-wise,
it's been a few weeks.

4048
03:07:53,968 --> 03:07:55,868
-LIAM: We've got time.
-SAM: Is there another one?

4049
03:07:55,901 --> 03:07:57,834
-TALIESIN: No.
-LAURA: The ambassador

4050
03:07:57,868 --> 03:08:01,267
to the Nine Hells
was in the City of Brass,

4051
03:08:01,300 --> 03:08:04,133
and we killed him,
and he's gonna hate us.

4052
03:08:04,167 --> 03:08:06,191
-SAM: Wait, he can come back?
-LAURA: I think so!

4053
03:08:06,191 --> 03:08:07,834
-TRAVIS: Hotis, oh, yeah.
-SAM: Well, we can't do anything

4054
03:08:07,868 --> 03:08:09,767
about that.

4055
03:08:10,968 --> 03:08:13,267
MATT: Make an arcana check, Sam.

4056
03:08:15,834 --> 03:08:19,634
SAM: Uh, more than 20--23.

4057
03:08:19,667 --> 03:08:21,000
MATT: Twenty-three.

4058
03:08:21,033 --> 03:08:25,868
Umm, best that you know,

4059
03:08:25,901 --> 03:08:30,534
as far as like hierarchies
and devils in that plane,

4060
03:08:30,567 --> 03:08:35,100
a devil as high-ranking as
the one that you guys fought

4061
03:08:35,133 --> 03:08:37,834
that got its ass handed to it
by a bunch of random people

4062
03:08:37,868 --> 03:08:42,200
in the City of Brass
is considered such a slight

4063
03:08:42,234 --> 03:08:45,400
in the eyes of the hierarchy
of the Nine Hells,

4064
03:08:45,434 --> 03:08:48,634
that devil probably
has been punished

4065
03:08:48,667 --> 03:08:50,767
stripped of its power,

4066
03:08:50,801 --> 03:08:55,400
and is not something you
probably need to worry about.

4067
03:08:55,434 --> 03:08:57,801
LAURA: Oh, shit!

4068
03:08:57,834 --> 03:09:01,033
(cross talk)

4069
03:09:01,067 --> 03:09:02,534
Nice!

4070
03:09:02,567 --> 03:09:04,701
TALIESIN: He does not get
to come back next week.

4071
03:09:04,734 --> 03:09:06,801
SAM: We've done something
on our to-do list.

4072
03:09:06,834 --> 03:09:09,000
TALIESIN: I have a bit of...

4073
03:09:09,033 --> 03:09:11,334
I have a bit of work to do
around the house, so to speak.

4074
03:09:11,367 --> 03:09:13,534
There's a few matters
that have to be tended to here

4075
03:09:13,567 --> 03:09:15,834
that we should at least
get up and started, but...

4076
03:09:15,868 --> 03:09:18,968
-MARISHA: I mean, I feel like...
-TALIESIN: ...nothing's urgent.

4077
03:09:19,000 --> 03:09:22,367
MARISHA: I feel like the giant
green dragon in the room

4078
03:09:22,400 --> 03:09:23,801
is pretty urgent.

4079
03:09:23,834 --> 03:09:25,868
TALIESIN: It's the top of the list,
but it's not something

4080
03:09:25,901 --> 03:09:27,701
that's going to be
solved tomorrow.

4081
03:09:27,734 --> 03:09:28,901
It's not something
that's necessarily

4082
03:09:28,934 --> 03:09:30,133
going to bite us tomorrow.

4083
03:09:30,167 --> 03:09:32,100
I think it's going
to bite us, honestly--

4084
03:09:32,133 --> 03:09:33,701
if we left it alone,
I think we would be

4085
03:09:33,734 --> 03:09:36,000
reaping the damage of it
in six months.

4086
03:09:36,033 --> 03:09:37,634
MATT: "Preferably no biting at all."

4087
03:09:37,667 --> 03:09:39,133
As you look,
you see at the table,

4088
03:09:39,167 --> 03:09:41,701
her hair kinda pulled up
into these small circles

4089
03:09:41,734 --> 03:09:44,968
at the bottom of her head--
you see Allura, um,

4090
03:09:45,000 --> 03:09:47,267
with just kinda
like a nightrobe on.

4091
03:09:47,267 --> 03:09:49,033
LAURA: She has fun buns.

4092
03:09:49,067 --> 03:09:51,200
MATT: She steps in...

4093
03:09:51,234 --> 03:09:56,434
you see a woman standing
with blondish, light hair

4094
03:09:56,467 --> 03:09:58,167
that's been braided
into long braids

4095
03:09:58,200 --> 03:09:59,267
and then curled up into

4096
03:09:59,300 --> 03:10:02,334
these small little balls
underneath

4097
03:10:02,367 --> 03:10:07,033
with like a dark blue--
almost shimmering materials

4098
03:10:07,067 --> 03:10:09,901
are her robe.

4099
03:10:09,934 --> 03:10:12,834
She steps in a sits down
across from you guys

4100
03:10:12,868 --> 03:10:14,234
at the other end of the table

4101
03:10:14,267 --> 03:10:15,367
and begins taking them out

4102
03:10:15,400 --> 03:10:18,100
and begins kind of
rebraiding them.

4103
03:10:18,133 --> 03:10:22,400
"I'm very happy to see
that you're all safe.

4104
03:10:22,434 --> 03:10:25,767
From what I've also been told,
that there is no need

4105
03:10:25,801 --> 03:10:30,501
to maintain the illusory barrier
over Whitestone,

4106
03:10:30,534 --> 03:10:34,300
which is of great relief to me

4107
03:10:34,334 --> 03:10:38,133
as that's been draining.

4108
03:10:38,167 --> 03:10:41,701
I have also heard
that Thordak has fallen,

4109
03:10:41,734 --> 03:10:44,300
so congratulations
are in order."

4110
03:10:44,334 --> 03:10:48,734
SAM: We also found you
a replacement flying carpet.

4111
03:10:48,767 --> 03:10:52,534
(laughing)

4112
03:10:52,567 --> 03:10:55,133
If you'd like it.

4113
03:10:55,167 --> 03:11:00,601
LAURA: Scanlan, you're on my list.

4114
03:11:00,634 --> 03:11:03,968
SAM: Although we could use it
in our battles to come.

4115
03:11:04,000 --> 03:11:08,000
MATT: "I'll tell you what--
when I have my tower rebuilt,

4116

our focus was more
to banish the creature

as opposed to trying to walk
into the center of its home,

4198
03:15:06,801 --> 03:15:11,267
I mean, you've--
you've come across

4199
03:15:11,300 --> 03:15:13,634
a modicum of necromancy
in your years--

4200
03:15:13,667 --> 03:15:15,901
your younger years, at least.

4201
03:15:15,934 --> 03:15:23,901
Usually, low level,
employed by various tribal sages

4202
03:15:23,934 --> 03:15:26,567
and wandering,
marauding hordes of orcs

4203
03:15:26,601 --> 03:15:30,267
or knolls that were, you know,
given positions of power

4204
03:15:30,300 --> 03:15:31,767
within their small cultures,

4205
03:15:31,801 --> 03:15:33,167
because they had
begun to harness

4206
03:15:33,200 --> 03:15:35,000
some of the powers
of life and death,

4207
03:15:35,033 --> 03:15:39,501
but nothing that really
left a lasting impression.

4208
03:15:39,534 --> 03:15:43,868
There was one tomb
that you excavated

4209
03:15:43,901 --> 03:15:49,067
that it was beyond
the southern lands

4210
03:15:49,100 --> 03:15:52,434
of the Stormcrest Mountains.

4211
03:15:52,467 --> 03:15:55,100
It was in
the Reifenmist Peninsula,

4212
03:15:55,133 --> 03:15:58,467
which is the thick
jungles that exist

4213
03:15:58,501 --> 03:16:01,734
on the southern peninsula
of Tal'Dorei,

4214
03:16:01,767 --> 03:16:02,934
below the countryside,

4215
03:16:02,968 --> 03:16:04,601
below the actual
political structure.

4216
03:16:04,634 --> 03:16:07,200
It's a free land,
it is beyond the rule

4217
03:16:07,234 --> 03:16:09,234
of Tal'Dorei or Syngorn,

4218
03:16:09,267 --> 03:16:13,033
and it is where refugees
flee from society.

4219
03:16:13,067 --> 03:16:15,334
It's where folks that want
to live beyond the law

4220
03:16:15,367 --> 03:16:17,767
go and build their own place,

4221
03:16:17,801 --> 03:16:20,534
but south of that
into the jungle,

4222
03:16:20,567 --> 03:16:24,968
there are many lost
and ancient places

4223
03:16:25,000 --> 03:16:27,501
that were either
forgotten intentionally,

4224
03:16:27,534 --> 03:16:29,033
or buried through time

4225
03:16:29,067 --> 03:16:32,000
as the founding
to the age of Arcanum

4226
03:16:32,033 --> 03:16:34,501
in these eons past and past.

4227
03:16:34,534 --> 03:16:36,434
There is one tomb
that you went to

4228
03:16:36,467 --> 03:16:40,033
that was steeped
in heavy necromancy

4229
03:16:40,067 --> 03:16:42,200
and even just
a short journey in,

4230
03:16:42,234 --> 03:16:44,501
you lost two friends,

4231
03:16:44,534 --> 03:16:47,667
watching the life sucked
from their corpses,

4232
03:16:47,701 --> 03:16:54,033
left behind just these
dust-skinned skeletal memories,

4233
03:16:54,067 --> 03:16:56,367
and you fled--you
and the remaining members

4234
03:16:56,400 --> 03:16:58,067
of your team.

4235
03:16:59,701 --> 03:17:02,968
Since then, you've
been keenly aware

4236
03:17:03,000 --> 03:17:05,167
of the awful effects
of necromancy,

4237
03:17:05,200 --> 03:17:07,601
and it honestly scares you,

4238
03:17:07,634 --> 03:17:09,467
and so the more
this discussion continues,

4239
03:17:09,501 --> 03:17:13,400
the more and more just uneasy
you become with the discussion.

4240
03:17:13,434 --> 03:17:18,467
Um, as far as the essence
of what Opash may have in store,

4241
03:17:18,501 --> 03:17:21,868
uh, you're not
particularly sure,

4242
03:17:21,901 --> 03:17:28,000
but, um, I mean, the domain
of necromancy is life and death.

4243
03:17:28,033 --> 03:17:32,534
Um, and that central theme

4244
03:17:32,567 --> 03:17:35,434
keeps reemerging
with Thordak, with Raishan,

with whatever this dynamic is,

4246
03:17:36,834 --> 03:17:38,601
there's something
about life and death

4247
03:17:38,634 --> 03:17:40,300
that is cyclical
in this conversation

TRAVIS: Don't you put that evil on us.

4271
03:19:01,534 --> 03:19:03,234
Don't even put it out there.

4272
03:19:03,267 --> 03:19:04,968
LIAM: Matt hadn't even
thought of that!

4273
03:19:05,000 --> 03:19:06,534
TALIESIN: Three times,
you say it three times.

4274
03:19:06,567 --> 03:19:08,634
SAM: Door made of lava.

4275
03:19:10,834 --> 03:19:12,567
MATT: "If you do decide to inquire,

4276
03:19:12,601 --> 03:19:16,133
this island of Viscon,

4277
03:19:16,167 --> 03:19:20,968
carefully, slowly, methodically,

4278
03:19:21,000 --> 03:19:22,467
whether or not this has a tie

4279
03:19:22,501 --> 03:19:28,868
or this is specifically
where the deceiver lives

4280
03:19:28,901 --> 03:19:31,701
at the moment, who knows
how long they'll stay.

4281
03:19:31,734 --> 03:19:34,801
You say she's seeking
something there?"

4282
03:19:34,834 --> 03:19:37,033
LAURA: That's what Keyleth
said it seemed like.

4283
03:19:37,067 --> 03:19:39,334
MARISHA: She seemed to be poring
through tomes and books

4284
03:19:39,367 --> 03:19:40,434
looking for something.

4285
03:19:40,467 --> 03:19:43,601
She seemed very frustrated.

4286
03:19:43,634 --> 03:19:46,868
Question--oh, go ahead.

4287
03:19:46,901 --> 03:19:48,234
MATT: "Let's just say,
what happens if she finds

4288
03:19:48,267 --> 03:19:49,334
what she's looking for?"

4289
03:19:49,367 --> 03:19:51,400
MARISHA: Exactly.

4290
03:19:51,434 --> 03:19:57,033
PATRICK: Oh, she brings the dragon
back from the dead.

4291
03:19:57,067 --> 03:20:00,067
TALIESIN: Or transfers her consciousness
into the dragon's body,

4292
03:20:00,100 --> 03:20:02,033
reanimates an undead red dragon.

4293
03:20:02,067 --> 03:20:04,000
LAURA: I don't know what necromancy
is capable of.

4294
03:20:04,033 --> 03:20:05,734
TALIESIN: ...create some unholy monster.

4295
03:20:05,767 --> 03:20:08,200
-PATRICK: You...
-SAM: There's also dragon babies.

4296
03:20:08,234 --> 03:20:13,267
PATRICK: ...put into the--
into the eggs...

4297
03:20:13,300 --> 03:20:16,501
LAURA: Hey, K, you remember when
I said you were really smart?

4298
03:20:16,534 --> 03:20:19,534
(laughing)

4299
03:20:19,567 --> 03:20:22,367
SAM: He makes wagon hitches,
all right?

4300
03:20:22,400 --> 03:20:24,367
-Listen!
-LIAM: I like this guy.

4301
03:20:24,400 --> 03:20:26,634
SAM: He's a simple man!

4302
03:20:28,100 --> 03:20:30,334
He's a great wagon hitch maker.

4303
03:20:30,367 --> 03:20:32,367
PATRICK: Well, I mean,
why do you take a body?

4304
03:20:32,400 --> 03:20:34,033
I mean, well,

4305
03:20:34,067 --> 03:20:36,267
and you're all like,
"Well, I died Tuesday,

4306
03:20:36,300 --> 03:20:38,534
I died Thursday!"

4307
03:20:38,567 --> 03:20:42,701
Like, and then you killed--
how bad did you kill the dragon?

4308
03:20:42,734 --> 03:20:45,434
Because if you didn't
kill it real bad--

4309
03:20:45,467 --> 03:20:46,501
LAURA: It could be brought back.

4310
03:20:46,534 --> 03:20:48,267
PATRICK: Like Tuesday, right?

4311
03:20:48,300 --> 03:20:50,567
LAURA: At least
the gem was shattered--

4312
03:20:50,601 --> 03:20:52,100
the gem was shattered.

4313
03:20:52,133 --> 03:20:53,367
-MATT: "It was?"
-LAURA: Yes.

4314
03:20:53,400 --> 03:20:54,534
MATT: "You destroyed the Soul Anchor?"

4315
03:20:54,567 --> 03:20:56,000
LAURA: Yeah, and Thordak shrunk!

4316
03:20:56,033 --> 03:20:59,601
He was huge, and then
he was like normal after that.

4317
03:20:59,634 --> 03:21:01,567
MATT: "Well, that's something at least."

4318
03:21:01,601 --> 03:21:03,067
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's something.

4319
03:21:03,100 --> 03:21:06,434
SAM: I don't think that she's trying
to reanimate Thordak.

4320
03:21:06,467 --> 03:21:08,567
I think she's
trying to probe him

4321
03:21:08,601 --> 03:21:10,000
for knowledge of some sort.

4322
03:21:10,033 --> 03:21:12,901
-TRAVIS: Probe.
-TALIESIN: I think she's attempting--

4323
03:21:12,934 --> 03:21:14,434
SAM: She's trying to probe
his dead body.

4324
03:21:14,467 --> 03:21:16,267
TRAVIS: Probe.

4325
03:21:18,901 --> 03:21:24,200
MARISHA: Allura, if we scried
on this island,

4326
03:21:24,234 --> 03:21:29,567
if you saw it again,
would you recognize it?

4327
03:21:29,601 --> 03:21:32,267
MATT: "I'm--I haven't been there,

4328
03:21:32,300 --> 03:21:36,400
-but if I were to scry..."
-MARISHA: Oh, I thought you said...

4329
03:21:36,434 --> 03:21:39,400
MATT: "...what would you require--
what would you need?"

4330
03:21:39,434 --> 03:21:41,100
MARISHA: I wanna confirm
if she actually is

4331
03:21:41,133 --> 03:21:43,868
on the island
of Viscar--Viscon.

4332
03:21:43,901 --> 03:21:46,300
MATT: "Well, I mean, I can attempt to.

4333
03:21:46,334 --> 03:21:48,300
I've only heard of it, so..."

4334
03:21:49,934 --> 03:21:52,300
SAM: Do you--what if we--

4335
03:21:52,334 --> 03:21:55,400
would it help you to scry
if we gave you some blood

4336
03:21:55,434 --> 03:21:58,534
of the thing that
we're scrying on?

4337
03:21:58,567 --> 03:22:00,100
LAURA: Thordak?

4338
03:22:00,133 --> 03:22:03,100
MARISHA: But she would still see
the same thing that I would--

4339
03:22:03,133 --> 03:22:04,267
that I would've seen.

4340
03:22:04,300 --> 03:22:06,467
-It wouldn't confirm the island.
-LAURA: Oh, right.

4341
03:22:06,501 --> 03:22:09,133
TALIESIN: It also might mean
that we would be discovered.

4342
03:22:09,167 --> 03:22:11,234
SAM: Keyleth, don't you have some spell

4343
03:22:11,267 --> 03:22:13,000
where you say
the name of a place

4344
03:22:13,033 --> 03:22:15,033
and it shows you
the way there or something?

4345
03:22:15,067 --> 03:22:17,167
LIAM: Well, can you look
for trees on that island?

4346
03:22:17,200 --> 03:22:20,200
MARISHA: I could try and scry...

4347
03:22:21,868 --> 03:22:25,693
on Viscar--Viscon.

4348
03:22:25,693 --> 03:22:27,801
Right? If I know
enough about Viscon,

4349
03:22:27,834 --> 03:22:30,234
I could try and scry
on a location, correct?

4350
03:22:30,267 --> 03:22:31,701
SAM: No, you can only scry
on a person.

4351
03:22:31,734 --> 03:22:33,367
MATT: Yup, you can scry
on a location.

4352
03:22:33,400 --> 03:22:34,767
That was my fault
in the past, by the way.

4353
03:22:34,801 --> 03:22:36,667
I completely--I--
very into the spell.

4354
03:22:36,701 --> 03:22:39,567
SAM: But no, don't you have
like a directions spell?

4355
03:22:39,601 --> 03:22:42,501
-MARISHA: Find the path, yeah.
-SAM: What does that do?

4356
03:22:42,534 --> 03:22:45,100
MATT: Yeah, if you have
secondhand knowledge,

4357
03:22:45,133 --> 03:22:46,701
and you've heard of the target,
you can still scry to it,

4358
03:22:46,734 --> 03:22:49,067
it just has a modifier--
if it's a target.

4359
03:22:49,100 --> 03:22:53,234
If it's a location, um...

4360
03:22:53,267 --> 03:22:55,601
LAURA: But, 'cause I--will it--

4361
03:22:55,634 --> 03:22:57,167
I mean, we lucked out
the first time

4362
03:22:57,200 --> 03:22:58,767
that she didn't catch on.

4363
03:22:58,801 --> 03:23:00,701
What if she realizes?

4364
03:23:00,734 --> 03:23:03,767
MARISHA: If I scry on the island,
she won't notice.

4365
03:23:03,801 --> 03:23:05,300
-LAURA: Okay.
-MARISHA: It's only if I scry on her.

4366
03:23:05,334 --> 03:23:07,501
SAM: ...you're looking
at some leaves and trees.

4367
03:23:07,534 --> 03:23:09,434
TALIESIN: But we'll get an idea
of where to go.

4368
03:23:09,467 --> 03:23:12,067
-MARISHA: I could look--
-LIAM: You saw it once already,

4369
03:23:12,100 --> 03:23:13,934
and you would know it--
you'd probably recognize it

4370
03:23:13,968 --> 03:23:16,501
-a second time.
-MARISHA: Would I?

4371
03:23:16,534 --> 03:23:18,167
-TRAVIS: Would you?
-LIAM: It's worth a fucking shot.

4372
03:23:18,200 --> 03:23:22,400
MARISHA: If I--if I scried on Viscon,

4373
03:23:22,434 --> 03:23:24,200
could I recognize, yeah,

4374
03:23:24,234 --> 03:23:26,534
this looks like
the similar island?

4375
03:23:26,567 --> 03:23:27,534
MATT: You could try, yeah.

4376
03:23:27,567 --> 03:23:29,467
LAURA: Yeah, you could certainly try.

4377
03:23:29,501 --> 03:23:31,434
MATT: You can certainly try.

4378
03:23:31,467 --> 03:23:32,711
Thank you, Laura.

4379
03:23:32,711 --> 03:23:34,155
I needed a little goose.

4380
03:23:34,155 --> 03:23:35,690
-MARISHA: All right.
-MATT: Needed a little ...

4381
03:23:35,690 --> 03:23:37,701
MARISHA: Last fifth-level
spell of the day.

4382
03:23:37,734 --> 03:23:39,801
(cross talk)

4383
03:23:42,033 --> 03:23:45,334
LAURA: Ker, you should try this wine
that Grog got from--

4384
03:23:45,334 --> 03:23:47,033
-TRAVIS: Yes!
-MARISHA: You should try it!

4385
03:23:47,067 --> 03:23:49,968
-TRAVIS: Oh, it's really good!
-MARISHA: It's so tasty!

4386
03:23:50,000 --> 03:23:54,033
-TRAVIS: ...sand dunes of terribleness.
-LIAM: I mean, you don't want to--

4387
03:23:54,067 --> 03:23:55,434
I haven't tried it either.

4388
03:23:55,467 --> 03:23:57,328
You don't want
to finish your life

4389
03:23:57,328 --> 03:23:58,868
without trying this bug juice.

4390
03:23:58,901 --> 03:24:00,467
It's the nickname
we have for it.

4391
03:24:00,501 --> 03:24:02,701
TRAVIS: I pop the top,
and I hand the bottle to him.

4392
03:24:02,734 --> 03:24:04,868
LAURA: Just small--small amounts.

4393
03:24:04,901 --> 03:24:08,200
TRAVIS: What is it, sand keg, sand...

4394
03:24:08,234 --> 03:24:11,634
-LIAM: Bug juice.
-TRAVIS: Yeah, that stuff.

4395
03:24:11,667 --> 03:24:14,167
(cross talk)

4396
03:24:14,200 --> 03:24:15,567
LIAM: I take the bottle,
and I put my thumb over it

4397
03:24:15,601 --> 03:24:16,601
and pretend like
I'm drinking--go--

4398
03:24:16,601 --> 03:24:18,667
MATT: Sleight-of-hand.

4399
03:24:18,667 --> 03:24:20,734
LIAM: That's great, sure.

4400
03:24:22,868 --> 03:24:25,934
LIAM: Sure, sure, sure.

4401
03:24:25,968 --> 03:24:28,267
LIAM: That is a 26.

4402
03:24:28,300 --> 03:24:31,400
MATT: For the hell of it, Kerrek,
go ahead and roll--

4403
03:24:31,434 --> 03:24:34,734
roll a perception check.

4404
03:24:34,767 --> 03:24:37,734
PATRICK: Uh, no, not by--
not by a country mile.

4405
03:24:37,767 --> 03:24:39,234
MATT: He took a mighty swig.

4406
03:24:39,267 --> 03:24:40,901
PATRICK: Yeah, well, it's--

4407
03:24:40,934 --> 03:24:44,033
-LAURA: Don't take a swig that big.
-PATRICK: It's that good?

4408
03:24:44,067 --> 03:24:45,901
-LIAM: It's smooth.
-TRAVIS: It has really got

4409
03:24:45,934 --> 03:24:47,934
-some balls on it.
-LIAM: It goes down smooth.

4410
03:24:47,968 --> 03:24:50,200
PATRICK: You gotta shake the flavor in.

4411
03:24:50,234 --> 03:24:51,767
(laughing)

4412
03:24:51,801 --> 03:24:55,100
'Cause the flavor goes
slowly to the bottom.

4413
03:24:55,133 --> 03:24:57,300
-LAURA: Oh, God, oh, no.
-PATRICK: It's 'cause of the gravity.

4414
03:24:57,334 --> 03:24:58,868
LAURA: What if he realized
something we didn't?

4415
03:24:58,901 --> 03:25:00,267
MARISHA: See, I told you see was wise.

4416
03:25:00,300 --> 03:25:01,834
LIAM: I wish it could be
my first time again.

4417
03:25:01,868 --> 03:25:05,334
MATT: So as the liquid hits
your lips, it's thick.

4418
03:25:05,367 --> 03:25:06,801
It's like...

4419
03:25:06,834 --> 03:25:09,033
(laughing)

4420
03:25:09,067 --> 03:25:10,968
PATRICK: Too much flavor.

4421
03:25:12,767 --> 03:25:14,601
MATT: It doesn't pour
like wine or liquor,

4422
03:25:14,634 --> 03:25:16,234
it pours more like a--

4423
03:25:16,267 --> 03:25:18,868
like a light honey.

4424
03:25:18,901 --> 03:25:25,367
But it has
a very acrid, um...

4425
03:25:25,400 --> 03:25:29,167
pungent, immediate flavor
as it hits your tongue.

4426
03:25:29,200 --> 03:25:31,767
I need you to roll
a constitution saving throw.

4427
03:25:31,801 --> 03:25:38,067
PATRICK: So is this like when I left
that glass of Surge out

4428
03:25:38,100 --> 03:25:42,400
for so long that it
evaporated in the cup down?

4429
03:25:42,434 --> 03:25:43,868
-TRAVIS: Just, like, ...
-MATT: Kind of, yeah.

4430
03:25:43,901 --> 03:25:48,501
PATRICK: And then because there
was no mold growing on it,

4431
03:25:48,534 --> 03:25:50,968
and I am a scientist at heart...

4432
03:25:51,000 --> 03:25:52,100
TRAVIS: It's all clear.

4433
03:25:52,133 --> 03:25:53,734
TALIESIN: You went where mold
feared to tread.

4434
03:25:53,767 --> 03:25:55,667
PATRICK: I, uh--I thought,

4435
03:25:55,701 --> 03:25:57,834
when will I ever have
this opportunity again?

4436
03:25:57,868 --> 03:25:59,467
MATT: When the most basic
forms of life

4437
03:25:59,501 --> 03:26:01,701
eschew existing on a substance,

4438
03:26:01,734 --> 03:26:03,767
that's when you
have to drink it.

4439
03:26:03,801 --> 03:26:05,634
TRAVIS: Agreed.

4440
03:26:05,667 --> 03:26:09,033
TALIESIN: Yes, yes!

4441
03:26:09,067 --> 03:26:11,801
PATRICK: That's gonna be
my best role all year.

4442
03:26:11,834 --> 03:26:14,267
MATT: So--so--

4443
03:26:14,300 --> 03:26:16,334
LIAM: Wait, can I point out

4444
03:26:16,367 --> 03:26:19,033
that this is the best game
in existence?

4445
03:26:19,067 --> 03:26:19,847
(laughing)

4446
03:26:19,847 --> 03:26:20,927
MATT: You may.

4447
03:26:23,367 --> 03:26:24,667
As it fills your gullet,

4448
03:26:24,701 --> 03:26:26,868
the warm, burning sensation
you're used to

4449
03:26:26,901 --> 03:26:29,200
with fine,
heavy liquors is surpassed

4450
03:26:29,234 --> 03:26:35,000
by the ever-burning sensation
of fire within your lungs,

4451
03:26:35,033 --> 03:26:37,300
and as the heartburn
begins to kick in,

4452
03:26:37,334 --> 03:26:39,334
you stop for a second and
realize that the burn goes away

4453
03:26:39,367 --> 03:26:41,367
and everything goes numb.

4454
03:26:41,400 --> 03:26:42,701
Everything goes numb.

4455
03:26:42,734 --> 03:26:47,167
Your tongue...your jaw...

4456
03:26:47,200 --> 03:26:48,834
LAURA: How do you feel, Ker?

4457
03:26:53,200 --> 03:26:55,200
(indistinct speech)

4458
03:26:55,234 --> 03:26:57,567
(laughing)

4459
03:27:00,467 --> 03:27:02,067
LIAM: One more time?

4460
03:27:05,501 --> 03:27:07,400
SAM: Beard got in the way.

4461
03:27:10,267 --> 03:27:12,934
(indistinct speech)

4462
03:27:12,968 --> 03:27:16,167
(laughing)

4463
03:27:16,200 --> 03:27:17,901
LAURA: He likes it--
I think he likes it.

4464
03:27:17,934 --> 03:27:19,267
LIAM: I would've thought that as well.

4465
03:27:19,300 --> 03:27:20,334
TALIESIN: Ladies and gentlemen,
Burning Man,

4466
03:27:20,367 --> 03:27:21,400
ladies and gentlemen.

4467
03:27:21,434 --> 03:27:23,267
Welcome to Burning Man.

4468
03:27:23,300 --> 03:27:25,434
TRAVIS: That is good shit.

4469
03:27:25,467 --> 03:27:27,667
MARISHA: The fire has passed through you.

4470
03:27:27,701 --> 03:27:31,267
(laughing)

4471
03:27:31,300 --> 03:27:33,734
It's gonna go
all the way through you.

4472
03:27:33,767 --> 03:27:35,534
So be careful when it
comes out the other end.

4473
03:27:35,567 --> 03:27:37,300
LIAM: Good reincorporation!

4474
03:27:37,334 --> 03:27:39,300
(laughing)

4475
03:27:41,934 --> 03:27:43,701
TALIESIN: I remember this.

4476
03:27:43,734 --> 03:27:46,367
LAURA: But you're still conscious,
and that is saying something.

4477
03:27:46,400 --> 03:27:48,601
TRAVIS: Really impressive.

4478
03:27:48,634 --> 03:27:50,033
LAURA: I wouldn't drink
any more of it, though.

4479
03:27:50,067 --> 03:27:51,167
TRAVIS: No, no, no, yeah,
you gotta warm up

4480
03:27:51,200 --> 03:27:52,367
-and then take another one.
-LIAM: No, no, no,

4481
03:27:52,400 --> 03:27:54,901
I mean, that's all fun
and games, but come on.

4482
03:27:56,701 --> 03:27:58,200
MATT: As this is happening,
you all look over

4483
03:27:58,234 --> 03:28:00,133
and glance that, as Allura
has cleared the table

4484
03:28:00,167 --> 03:28:02,667
and begun to set a space
for the scry ritual,

4485
03:28:02,701 --> 03:28:04,934
-is just staring at you all.
-LAURA: Oh, shit, right.

4486
03:28:04,968 --> 03:28:07,601
MARISHA: Thanks for setting
this up for us, Allura.

4487
03:28:07,634 --> 03:28:09,601
-MATT: "Oh, please, keep going."
-TRAVIS: We didn't mean to be rude.

4488
03:28:09,634 --> 03:28:10,868
MATT: "This is the most fun
I've had in days."

4489
03:28:10,901 --> 03:28:13,300
TRAVIS: Do you want some?

4490
03:28:13,334 --> 03:28:14,467
TALIESIN: After!

4491
03:28:14,501 --> 03:28:17,434
(yelling)

4492
03:28:17,467 --> 03:28:20,400
LIAM: No, that's a bad idea,
don't do it!

4493
03:28:20,434 --> 03:28:21,801
-TRAVIS: Do it.
-SAM: She needs to do the spell!

4494
03:28:21,834 --> 03:28:24,133
LIAM: Do it later--
that shit's fucked up.

4495
03:28:24,167 --> 03:28:25,801
TRAVIS: Don't listen to him.

4496
03:28:25,834 --> 03:28:26,934
MARISHA: Wait, I thought
I was doing the spell.

4497
03:28:26,968 --> 03:28:28,734
We could do it together.

4498
03:28:28,767 --> 03:28:30,834
TRAVIS: We're trustworthy.
Open the bottle.

4499
03:28:30,868 --> 03:28:33,501
-Down the hatch.
-MATT: She pops it off, and goes,

4500
03:28:33,534 --> 03:28:36,067
"Look, it's morning,
we're all alive.

4501
03:28:36,100 --> 03:28:37,334
What's the point if
we're not celebrating?"

4502
03:28:37,367 --> 03:28:39,244
-TRAVIS: That's what I'm saying!
-LIAM: That will turn

4503
03:28:39,244 --> 03:28:41,234
your blonde hair green!

4504
03:28:41,267 --> 03:28:43,133
TALIESIN: No!

4505
03:28:43,167 --> 03:28:44,274
MATT: Ah.

4506
03:28:45,667 --> 03:28:46,834
"Not my favorite flavor."

4507
03:28:46,868 --> 03:28:48,133
(gasping)

4508
03:28:48,167 --> 03:28:50,024
-LIAM: She's got magic.
-SAM: She's so strong!

4509
03:28:50,024 --> 03:28:52,067
LAURA: Constitutions for days!

4510
03:28:52,067 --> 03:28:53,367
LIAM: She's so cool.

4511
03:28:53,400 --> 03:28:55,901
TRAVIS: Will you teach me
your sorcerous ways?

4512
03:28:55,934 --> 03:28:57,834
LAURA: Keep talking, keep talking.

4513
03:28:57,868 --> 03:28:59,234
TRAVIS: How do you feel?

4514
03:28:59,267 --> 03:29:01,300
MATT: "I feel fine."

4515
03:29:01,334 --> 03:29:03,267
TRAVIS: I don't--I don't
know what to say.

4516
03:29:03,300 --> 03:29:05,934
-LIAM: Fucking magic.
-SAM: She's amazing.

4517
03:29:05,968 --> 03:29:07,634
MARISHA: You're awesome.

4518
03:29:07,667 --> 03:29:10,601
LIAM: Can you say red leather,
yellow leather?

4519
03:29:14,434 --> 03:29:15,901
What about--

4520
03:29:15,934 --> 03:29:17,133
(laughing)

4521
03:29:17,167 --> 03:29:19,667
What about--try saying
three times in a row

4522
03:29:19,701 --> 03:29:22,100
can you say Irish wristwatch?

4523
03:29:22,133 --> 03:29:24,033
(laughing)

4524
03:29:27,267 --> 03:29:30,834
PATRICK: Three times in a row.

4525
03:29:30,868 --> 03:29:35,834
LIAM: This is to Ker or Patrick--
Irish wristwatch

4526
03:29:35,868 --> 03:29:37,968
as fast as you can
three times in a row.

4527
03:29:38,000 --> 03:29:39,634
I have faith in you.

4528
03:29:43,300 --> 03:29:45,000
PATRICK: Irish wr--

4529
03:29:45,033 --> 03:29:48,534
(laughing)

4530
03:29:48,567 --> 03:29:50,934
Irish wr--

4531
03:29:59,234 --> 03:30:02,200
Irish wish--

4532
03:30:02,234 --> 03:30:04,367
LIAM: You know, thank you for playing.

4533
03:30:06,267 --> 03:30:08,133
That was a valiant effort.

4534
03:30:10,634 --> 03:30:12,567
Hey, let's scry on a dragon!

4535
03:30:14,667 --> 03:30:15,801
MATT: "All right."

4536
03:30:15,834 --> 03:30:17,834
(laughing)

4537
03:30:20,501 --> 03:30:21,701
TRAVIS: Were you in a motorcycle gang?

4538
03:30:21,734 --> 03:30:25,033
How did she do that?

4539
03:30:25,067 --> 03:30:27,801
-LIAM: Warrior!
-SAM: She's immune to alcohol.

4540
03:30:27,834 --> 03:30:29,767
MATT: She sits across the table
from you and puts her hands out.

4541
03:30:29,801 --> 03:30:31,667
SAM: Oh, yeah, let's do this.

4542
03:30:31,701 --> 03:30:34,200
MARISHA: Oh, man, it just feels
like old days, Allura!

4543
03:30:34,234 --> 03:30:36,167
MATT: "That it does--simpler times."

4544
03:30:36,200 --> 03:30:37,868
MARISHA: Yes, it was.

4545
03:30:37,901 --> 03:30:39,400
MATT: As you both close your eyes

4546
03:30:39,434 --> 03:30:44,167
and you all watch as Allura
and Keyleth close their eyes.

4547
03:30:45,267 --> 03:30:48,601
A moment passes,
a second moment,

4548
03:30:48,634 --> 03:30:52,501
and across the smooth,
polished wood table surface

4549
03:30:52,534 --> 03:30:53,834
of which you've been
having breakfast,

4550
03:30:53,868 --> 03:30:57,100
you watch as the grain
begins to shift.

4551
03:30:57,133 --> 03:31:01,868
Almost these small lines
of light blue and white

4552
03:31:01,901 --> 03:31:04,734
sparkling, tiny arcane ley lines

4553
03:31:04,767 --> 03:31:07,300
begin to just curl
a circle around the table.

4554
03:31:07,334 --> 03:31:11,000
In the center,
their arms are clenched.

4555
03:31:11,033 --> 03:31:13,267
You watch as it
carves two circles--

4556
03:31:13,300 --> 03:31:14,868
one smaller one
within the other--

4557
03:31:14,901 --> 03:31:17,300
and then begin to form
these various, rigid,

4558
03:31:17,334 --> 03:31:21,000
star-like patterns within,
and as soon as the two points

4559
03:31:21,033 --> 03:31:22,701
eventually connect
in the center,

4560
03:31:22,734 --> 03:31:24,901
there's a flash,
and both Keyleth and Allura

4561
03:31:24,934 --> 03:31:27,267
open their eyes,
but there is no pupil,

4562
03:31:27,300 --> 03:31:29,267
there is no iris,
it is just white.

4563
03:31:29,300 --> 03:31:31,434
-TRAVIS: Creepy.
-PATRICK: Fuck.

4564
03:31:31,467 --> 03:31:35,200
(laughing)

4565
03:31:35,234 --> 03:31:38,868
TALIESIN: That was the most Brian Blessed
fuck I've ever...

4566
03:31:38,901 --> 03:31:39,968
It was amazing.

4567
03:31:40,000 --> 03:31:42,033
(laughter continues)

4568
03:31:45,167 --> 03:31:46,567
MATT: The two of you share a vision--

4569
03:31:46,601 --> 03:31:49,901
a vision of water,
a vision of endless ocean--

4570
03:31:49,934 --> 03:31:51,434
a familiar vision
of endless ocean.

4571
03:31:51,467 --> 03:31:54,934
You see small pillars of steam

4572
03:31:54,968 --> 03:31:57,501
rising out of the center
of this expanse,

4573
03:31:57,534 --> 03:31:58,901
clusters of them in places,

4574
03:31:58,934 --> 03:32:01,167
occasionally a few rocks
breaking the surface,

4575
03:32:01,200 --> 03:32:03,367
and beyond that,
you see an island

4576
03:32:03,400 --> 03:32:07,067
isolated out in the ocean,
covered with green.

4577
03:32:07,100 --> 03:32:10,234
You see a large mountain
set across one side

4578
03:32:10,267 --> 03:32:13,734
as your vision flashes inward
to an overhead view,

4579
03:32:13,767 --> 03:32:15,567
you see a familiar island.

4580
03:32:16,968 --> 03:32:19,067
SAM: ♪ And the line where
the sea meets the sky ♪

4581
03:32:19,100 --> 03:32:21,133
♪ It's blinding ♪♪

4582
03:32:21,167 --> 03:32:24,067
(laughing)

4583
03:32:24,100 --> 03:32:26,000
MATT: The vision fades,
you both return,

4584
03:32:26,033 --> 03:32:28,767
the circular glyphs
on the table

4585
03:32:28,801 --> 03:32:30,067
kind of sparkle out

4586
03:32:30,100 --> 03:32:32,467
leaving the smooth surface
untouched.

4587
03:32:32,501 --> 03:32:34,234
Both of their eyes clarify,

4588
03:32:34,267 --> 03:32:36,901
their irises
and pupils returning,

4589
03:32:36,934 --> 03:32:39,234
and they both take
a simultaneous breath,

4590
03:32:39,267 --> 03:32:41,334
and then release
each other's hands.

4591
03:32:43,367 --> 03:32:45,634
MARISHA: Holy shit.

4592
03:32:45,667 --> 03:32:47,167
-LAURA: So yeah?
-MARISHA: Yeah.

4593
03:32:47,200 --> 03:32:48,234
We know where she is.

4594
03:32:48,267 --> 03:32:50,067
(gasping)

4595
03:32:50,100 --> 03:32:51,267
It's the island.

4596
03:32:51,300 --> 03:32:52,868
LAURA: Do we know how to get
to the island?

4597
03:32:52,901 --> 03:32:54,767
MARISHA: I can tree stride us there.

4598
03:32:54,801 --> 03:32:56,334
I saw a tree--did I see
a tree big enough?

4599
03:32:56,367 --> 03:32:57,734
-MATT: There were a number of trees.
-LAURA: Oh, geez!

4600
03:32:57,767 --> 03:32:59,033
SAM: Palm trees?

4601
03:32:59,067 --> 03:33:01,667
LAURA: Oh, my God, we need
to rest and get there.

4602
03:33:01,701 --> 03:33:04,100
-MARISHA: We need to rest and get there.
-LIAM: We need to go the fuck to bed.

4603
03:33:04,133 --> 03:33:05,367
PATRICK: Let's go right now!

4604
03:33:05,400 --> 03:33:07,501
(cross talk)

4605
03:33:10,367 --> 03:33:12,100
That was a joke.

4606
03:33:12,133 --> 03:33:15,501
(laughing)

4607
03:33:15,534 --> 03:33:16,701
LAURA: Shit, we need to rest!

4608
03:33:16,734 --> 03:33:18,100
MARISHA: Oh, my God, yeah.

4609
03:33:18,133 --> 03:33:20,734
-LAURA: And go!
-MARISHA: We need to rest and go.

4610
03:33:20,767 --> 03:33:22,234
LIAM: We should go right away.

4611
03:33:22,267 --> 03:33:25,400
What a to-do to die today
at a minute or two 'til two.

4612
03:33:25,434 --> 03:33:27,267
SAM: Trippingly off the tongue.

4613
03:33:28,834 --> 03:33:31,100
-MATT: "You get two options."
-LAURA: Okay.

4614
03:33:31,133 --> 03:33:34,267
MATT: "And I defer to
your judgment on this.

4615
03:33:34,300 --> 03:33:35,934
You rest and prepare,

4616
03:33:35,968 --> 03:33:38,033
that leaves her
to rest and prepare."

4617
03:33:38,067 --> 03:33:40,167
-LAURA: Yes.
-MATT: "You don't rest,

4618
03:33:40,200 --> 03:33:42,067
she doesn't rest.

4619
03:33:42,100 --> 03:33:44,017
The choice is yours
as to which you think

4620
03:33:44,017 --> 03:33:46,634
leaves you in the more
advantageous position.

4621
03:33:46,667 --> 03:33:50,167
MARISHA: I--I--I cannot...

4622
03:33:50,200 --> 03:33:52,167
get us there.

4623
03:33:52,200 --> 03:33:54,467
-LAURA: We need to rest.
-LIAM: Can you get us there?

4624
03:33:54,501 --> 03:33:57,033
MATT: "I've unfortunately
already used my spell

4625
03:33:57,067 --> 03:34:00,100
to get you to..."

4626
03:34:00,133 --> 03:34:02,167
LIAM: But you're say--I understand
what you're saying.

4627
03:34:02,200 --> 03:34:03,868
-She's got nothing--
-MATT: She stops and goes,

4628
03:34:03,901 --> 03:34:06,567
"I've seen it, actually,
with the vision.

4629
03:34:06,601 --> 03:34:10,100
And I did rest--I do--I could.

4630
03:34:10,133 --> 03:34:12,467
I could get you there."

4631
03:34:12,501 --> 03:34:14,501
SAM: To what end?

4632
03:34:14,534 --> 03:34:16,901
-MATT: "The choice is yours."
-SAM: I have nothing.

4633
03:34:16,934 --> 03:34:20,467
LIAM: But Scanlan, pluses and minuses.

4634
03:34:20,501 --> 03:34:23,000
She has nothing.

4635
03:34:23,033 --> 03:34:27,167
SAM: I can't die, Vax.

4636
03:34:27,200 --> 03:34:28,701
I've already died once today,

4637
03:34:28,734 --> 03:34:29,934
I can't do it again.

4638
03:34:29,968 --> 03:34:31,234
LAURA: We don't have any healing.

4639
03:34:31,267 --> 03:34:34,868
If anybody dies,
we can't come back.

4640
03:34:34,901 --> 03:34:36,701
TRAVIS: I've got two healing potions.

4641
03:34:36,734 --> 03:34:40,100
MARISHA: Okay, all right.

4642
03:34:40,133 --> 03:34:41,934
(humming)

4643
03:34:41,968 --> 03:34:45,534
Is there a way, do you know,
where we can maybe, like,

4644
03:34:45,567 --> 03:34:48,234
restore ourselves faster?

4645
03:34:50,534 --> 03:34:53,033
(laughing)

4646
03:34:53,067 --> 03:34:55,367
MATT: "I wouldn't recommend that."

4647
03:34:55,400 --> 03:34:57,133
TRAVIS: Oh?

4648
03:34:57,167 --> 03:34:59,801
LAURA: Oh!

4649
03:34:59,834 --> 03:35:01,501
MATT: "But nevertheleth..."

4650
03:35:01,534 --> 03:35:02,934
(laughing)

4651
03:35:02,968 --> 03:35:04,901
TRAVIS: Amazing.

4652
03:35:04,934 --> 03:35:07,567
PATRICK: Say, Irish wr--wr--

4653
03:35:07,601 --> 03:35:09,868
(laughing)

4654
03:35:09,901 --> 03:35:11,334
TALIESIN: Hard, isn't it?

4655
03:35:17,567 --> 03:35:19,673
MATT: She goes back to
braiding her hair.

4656
03:35:19,673 --> 03:35:21,934
(laughing)

4657
03:35:21,968 --> 03:35:24,834
MARISHA: What is the minimum amount
of time we could sleep?

4658
03:35:24,868 --> 03:35:26,334
MATT: Eight hours.

4659
03:35:26,367 --> 03:35:27,868
(grumbling)

4660
03:35:27,901 --> 03:35:29,167
TRAVIS: Let's do it, let's sleep.

4661
03:35:29,200 --> 03:35:31,701
LIAM: So if we rest,
she gets her meteors,

4662
03:35:31,734 --> 03:35:33,000
she gets her everything.

4663
03:35:33,033 --> 03:35:34,901
-LAURA: She gets it all back.
-SAM: And she could leave.

4664
03:35:37,234 --> 03:35:40,067
LIAM: She's gonna rest, too,
to get all her shit back.

4665
03:35:40,100 --> 03:35:44,167
If we go now,
having had a breather

4666
03:35:44,200 --> 03:35:46,033
with this drunk guy...

4667
03:35:47,567 --> 03:35:50,300
-LAURA: No!
-LIAM: I'm not saying what we do.

4668
03:35:50,334 --> 03:35:52,400
You can decide what we do
because you're the smart one,

4669
03:35:52,434 --> 03:35:53,734
but I'm just talking it out.

4670
03:35:53,767 --> 03:35:55,434
She--it would be
a physical fight

4671
03:35:55,467 --> 03:35:57,634
with none of her magic.

4672
03:35:57,667 --> 03:36:00,467
TALIESIN: If we had--if we had
a dragon with us, I'd say yes.

4673
03:36:00,501 --> 03:36:03,014
LIAM: You two brainiacs
can make the decision,

4674
03:36:03,014 --> 03:36:06,133
but she's got no meteors,
she's got a lot less.

4675
03:36:06,167 --> 03:36:08,267
LAURA: Look, we took on Thordak
with full health,

4676
03:36:08,300 --> 03:36:11,267
and we made it out pretty well.

4677
03:36:11,300 --> 03:36:13,167
MARISHA: I mean, once again,
unless we do this--

4678
03:36:13,200 --> 03:36:16,267
unless we get to the island,

4679
03:36:16,300 --> 03:36:20,133
try and scout out--
find Raishan...

4680
03:36:20,167 --> 03:36:24,767
...island,
that way if she moves...

4681
03:36:24,801 --> 03:36:26,667
we won't let her leave?

4682
03:36:27,834 --> 03:36:29,701
What Grog, what?

4683
03:36:29,734 --> 03:36:33,067
SAM: I can't camp on the island,
I don't have the mansion.

4684
03:36:33,100 --> 03:36:36,934
MARISHA: We can camp like we did
old school style.

4685
03:36:36,968 --> 03:36:38,467
TALIESIN: She would know
that we were there--

4686
03:36:38,501 --> 03:36:41,801
LAURA: Wait a minute,
you said you had it left.

4687
03:36:41,834 --> 03:36:44,200
TALIESIN: And if we go there...

4688
03:36:44,234 --> 03:36:45,834
LAURA: Scanlan, you said you
still had the spell left

4689
03:36:45,868 --> 03:36:47,701
-so we could--
-MARISHA: No, he used it

4690
03:36:47,734 --> 03:36:51,534
to change Jarrett's mind, right?

4691
03:36:51,567 --> 03:36:52,868
MATT: Well, you don't know that.

4692
03:36:52,901 --> 03:36:55,133
MARISHA: Well.

4693
03:36:55,167 --> 03:36:57,634
LAURA: Oh, well, shit.

4694
03:36:57,667 --> 03:36:59,868
SAM: I used it in the battle,
fuck off.

4695
03:36:59,901 --> 03:37:01,968
(laughing)

4696
03:37:04,434 --> 03:37:05,968
TALIESIN: If--if we were to go right now,

4697
03:37:06,000 --> 03:37:07,467
I would almost recommend

4698
03:37:07,501 --> 03:37:09,868
that Scanlan
and Keyleth stay behind

4699
03:37:09,901 --> 03:37:12,300
because they would be
nothing but targets.

4700
03:37:13,667 --> 03:37:15,467
TRAVIS: Ooh, how does that feel?

4701
03:37:15,501 --> 03:37:16,834
LIAM: Well, then, we won't do that.

4702
03:37:16,868 --> 03:37:18,067
TALIESIN: Which is why we shouldn't go,

4703
03:37:18,100 --> 03:37:21,334
because if we go, it is...
the four of us.

4704
03:37:21,367 --> 03:37:24,367
TRAVIS: Strangely, I agree with Percy.

4705
03:37:24,400 --> 03:37:27,100
TALIESIN: And if we wait a day?

4706
03:37:29,267 --> 03:37:31,667
It's six--it's at least
six, seven, eight of us--

4707
03:37:31,701 --> 03:37:32,834
however many was can bring,

4708
03:37:32,868 --> 03:37:35,234
but every magic user
right now is--

4709
03:37:35,267 --> 03:37:37,434
-LAURA: Tapped.
-LIAM: Allura.

4710
03:37:37,467 --> 03:37:38,667
-MATT: "Yes."
-LAURA: Except for her.

4711
03:37:38,701 --> 03:37:41,734
LIAM: I kinda wanted to bring you
in the beginning.

4712
03:37:41,767 --> 03:37:44,434
Are you willing to come with us?

4713
03:37:44,467 --> 03:37:47,634
MATT: "There's no need for me
to maintain the illutho--

4714
03:37:47,667 --> 03:37:50,950
-the illusory barrier on the thity."

4715
03:37:50,950 --> 03:37:52,470
-PATRICK: Wristwatch.

4716
03:37:52,470 --> 03:37:54,767
(laughing)

4717
03:37:54,801 --> 03:37:57,100
MARISHA: You did it!

4718
03:37:57,133 --> 03:37:58,701
MATT: "That's rather imprethive."

4719
03:38:01,200 --> 03:38:04,534
MARISHA: Okay, well, look,
if we wanted to go now,

4720
03:38:04,567 --> 03:38:08,234
I still have my beast shaping back.

4721
03:38:08,267 --> 03:38:10,934
TALIESIN: That's a bit...

4722
03:38:10,968 --> 03:38:14,334
MARISHA: I have one first-level spell,
two third-level spells,

4723
03:38:14,367 --> 03:38:17,767
and one fourth-level spell.

4724
03:38:17,801 --> 03:38:19,100
-LAURA: Oh, my God.
-SAM: That's enough to kill a dragon.

4725
03:38:19,133 --> 03:38:23,267
LIAM: Do we have--here's a question.

4726
03:38:23,300 --> 03:38:25,801
Do we have some
healing potions banked

4727
03:38:25,834 --> 03:38:27,968
-at Whitestone right now?
-TRAVIS: No.

4728
03:38:28,000 --> 03:38:29,534
-LAURA: We took them all.
-MATT: "To be perfectly honetht,

4729
03:38:29,567 --> 03:38:31,300
we've given you
everything we have."

4730
03:38:31,334 --> 03:38:32,868
(laughing)

4731
03:38:32,901 --> 03:38:34,834
-LAURA: Are there any--
-MATT: "Don't laugh at me, Vex'thahlia."

4732
03:38:34,868 --> 03:38:37,033
LAURA: I'm not, darling, I'm not.

4733
03:38:37,067 --> 03:38:39,133
MARISHA: I haven't used any of my health.

4734
03:38:39,167 --> 03:38:42,534
LAURA: Are there any steal-- heal--(stammering)

4735
03:38:42,567 --> 03:38:45,100
LAURA: Are there any healers
within the castle?

4736
03:38:45,133 --> 03:38:48,367
PATRICK: I am relatively fresh
in terms of healing.

4737
03:38:48,400 --> 03:38:50,601
I could heal some.

4738
03:38:50,634 --> 03:38:52,133
-LAURA: Would you wanna go with us?
-LIAM: Yes, but are you

4739
03:38:52,167 --> 03:38:54,200
in Burbank next week, though?

4740
03:38:54,234 --> 03:38:56,300
(laughing)

4741
03:38:56,334 --> 03:38:58,290
SAM: Pike is out!

4742
03:38:58,290 --> 03:39:00,400
LAURA: Pike is done.

4743
03:39:00,400 --> 03:39:03,100
She's got two 
first-level spells left.

4744
03:39:03,133 --> 03:39:04,234
That's it.

4745
03:39:04,267 --> 03:39:06,901
SAM: I have one fifth and one fourth.

4746
03:39:06,934 --> 03:39:08,200
No, two fourths.

4747
03:39:08,234 --> 03:39:09,901
LAURA: I think I've got two
first-levels spells left,

4748
03:39:09,934 --> 03:39:12,234
-but that's it.
-TALIESIN: It's--

4749
03:39:12,267 --> 03:39:13,767
TRAVIS: Let's be honest.

4750
03:39:13,801 --> 03:39:15,868
We're not quite at our best,

4751
03:39:15,901 --> 03:39:19,968
and it's one diseased
deceiver in a cave

4752
03:39:20,000 --> 03:39:21,834
with another
dead dragon that might

4753
03:39:21,868 --> 03:39:25,667
or might not come back to life,
and two baby little eggs.

4754
03:39:25,701 --> 03:39:29,501
We rest, and then
we give 'em hell!

4755
03:39:29,534 --> 03:39:33,801
PATRICK: The brass dragon, I feel,
made a great point

4756
03:39:33,834 --> 03:39:39,367
that if you let
someone of that...

4757
03:39:39,400 --> 03:39:43,801
-SAM: Power.
-PATRICK: ...power choose

4758
03:39:43,834 --> 03:39:46,167
the rules of engagement...

4759
03:39:48,801 --> 03:39:50,334
-LAURA: Right.
-LIAM: That's a good point,

4760
03:39:50,367 --> 03:39:52,634
and Allura makes a good point.

4761
03:39:54,234 --> 03:39:56,968
TRAVIS: Plus she doesn't know
that we know where she is.

4762
03:39:57,000 --> 03:40:00,167
She thinks she's got
all the time in the world.

4763
03:40:00,200 --> 03:40:01,467
SAM: You wanna go now?

4764
03:40:01,501 --> 03:40:03,267
TRAVIS: No, I wanna wait.

4765
03:40:03,300 --> 03:40:04,834
TALIESIN: Go tomorrow.

4766
03:40:04,868 --> 03:40:07,601
LAURA: I think we rest
and we go tonight.

4767
03:40:07,634 --> 03:40:09,868
We sleep eight hours,
it's only in the morning--

4768
03:40:09,901 --> 03:40:11,901
we go as soon as we're rested.

4769
03:40:11,934 --> 03:40:14,267
LIAM: She's gonna have
everything tomorrow.

4770
03:40:14,267 --> 03:40:18,567
MARISHA: Can we, like, do,
like, six hours...

4771
03:40:18,601 --> 03:40:19,834
SAM: She won't be
expecting us at all.

4772
03:40:19,868 --> 03:40:21,667
MARISHA: ...and chug some coffee?

4773
03:40:21,701 --> 03:40:23,434
MATT: Nope, need a full
eight hour rest.

4774
03:40:23,467 --> 03:40:25,133
SAM: She won't be
expecting us at all.

4775
03:40:25,167 --> 03:40:26,868
We'll still have
the element of surprise,

4776
03:40:26,901 --> 03:40:29,801
she won't have a lair to defend.

4777
03:40:29,834 --> 03:40:32,834
She won't have any other
fire giants to protect her.

4778
03:40:32,868 --> 03:40:34,367
TALIESIN: There might be a lair.

4779
03:40:34,400 --> 03:40:38,868
TRAVIS: Maybe, but we are fucking tits
against lairs, come on.

4780
03:40:38,901 --> 03:40:40,734
SAM: You have a dancing
fucking sword.

4781
03:40:40,767 --> 03:40:42,234
LAURA: That's right.

4782
03:40:42,267 --> 03:40:43,534
LIAM: Percy, what do you think?

4783
03:40:43,567 --> 03:40:48,667
TALIESIN: I think we--honestly,
I think that we--

4784
03:40:48,701 --> 03:40:50,434
I think if we go
right now, we win,

4785
03:40:50,467 --> 03:40:52,400
and at least one of us dies.

4786
03:40:52,434 --> 03:40:55,634
And if we go tomorrow,
we're probably going to win,

4787
03:40:55,667 --> 03:40:58,834
and probably most of us
are going to survive.

4788
03:40:58,868 --> 03:41:04,567
PATRICK: Unless she is merely
scrounging there.

4789
03:41:04,601 --> 03:41:06,167
TALIESIN: I think she might be scrounging,

4790
03:41:06,200 --> 03:41:08,667
but I think if she's scrounging,
that's a lot to look through.

4791
03:41:08,701 --> 03:41:10,567
I think that
she thinks she's safe.

4792
03:41:10,601 --> 03:41:13,734
LAURA: Did it look like there was
a lot of books there, Keyleth?

4793
03:41:13,767 --> 03:41:15,100
MATT: There were quite a number.

4794
03:41:15,133 --> 03:41:17,234
Probably 100 at the very least.

4795
03:41:17,267 --> 03:41:19,067
SAM: We don't even know what she is.

4796
03:41:19,100 --> 03:41:21,968
-Didn't you see a woman?
-LIAM: But that was her.

4797
03:41:22,000 --> 03:41:23,734
MARISHA: That's Raishan
in her female form.

4798
03:41:23,767 --> 03:41:26,634
LIAM: So she can look at books so
she doesn't fucking mangle them.

4799
03:41:26,667 --> 03:41:28,934
TRAVIS: Keyleth, are you worried
if we wait,

4800
03:41:28,968 --> 03:41:31,901
you're going to lose
the chance to kill Raishan?

4801
03:41:33,968 --> 03:41:36,977
MARISHA: I don't think we're gonna lose
the chance to kill Raishan,

4802
03:41:36,977 --> 03:41:40,601
it's just a matter
of who's killing who first.

4803
03:41:40,634 --> 03:41:42,567
TALIESIN: I say that we take
eight hours' sleep,

4804
03:41:42,601 --> 03:41:44,968
and we go there immediately.

4805
03:41:46,467 --> 03:41:48,567
TRAVIS: She thinks she's got cover,
but she doesn't.

4806
03:41:48,601 --> 03:41:51,033
TALIESIN: It will have
only been ten hours at best

4807
03:41:51,067 --> 03:41:52,267
by the time we get there.

4808
03:41:52,300 --> 03:41:54,467
MARISHA: Allura, since you know
of the island,

4809
03:41:54,501 --> 03:41:56,234
and we know where she is,
is there any way

4810
03:41:56,267 --> 03:41:58,100
where we can keep an eye
on the island

4811
03:41:58,133 --> 03:42:00,701
magically from afar?

4812
03:42:00,734 --> 03:42:04,267
If Raishan moves, we know?

4813
03:42:04,300 --> 03:42:11,534
MATT: "I mean, I can incrementally
scry on an island

4814
03:42:11,567 --> 03:42:14,167
and keep an eye on the vicinity,

4815
03:42:14,200 --> 03:42:18,300
but if I scry
directly on Raishan--"

4816
03:42:18,334 --> 03:42:19,767
-MARISHA: She could sense it.
-TALIESIN: She'll sense it.

4817
03:42:19,801 --> 03:42:21,601
MATT: "Well, there's a chance."

4818
03:42:21,634 --> 03:42:23,534
MARISHA: Yeah, let's not do that.

4819
03:42:25,067 --> 03:42:27,100
TRAVIS: Don't you wanna be at your best?

4820
03:42:27,133 --> 03:42:31,167
Don't you wanna be some fucking
wicked badass from the sky?

4821
03:42:31,200 --> 03:42:33,100
Or do you wanna limp in?

4822
03:42:33,133 --> 03:42:34,901
-LAURA: Right?
-TRAVIS: Yeah.

4823
03:42:34,934 --> 03:42:37,067
LAURA: Plus, if she's got
100 books to go through,

4824
03:42:37,100 --> 03:42:38,601
that's gonna take
more than two hours.

4825
03:42:38,634 --> 03:42:41,434
TALIESIN: She may not--it's possible
she may not even rest.

4826
03:42:41,467 --> 03:42:42,968
She might just be
so angry that she's--

4827
03:42:43,000 --> 03:42:44,901
LAURA: She might not be fully rested
by the time we get there.

4828
03:42:44,934 --> 03:42:47,033
TRAVIS: I know it feels like
an advantage to press,

4829
03:42:47,067 --> 03:42:49,834
but we were five down
at one point.

4830
03:42:49,868 --> 03:42:51,701
LAURA: I can't die again.

4831
03:42:51,734 --> 03:42:54,501
TRAVIS: You can, but it's not advisable.

4832
03:42:56,434 --> 03:42:57,767
TALIESIN: Let's not let that happen.

4833
03:42:57,801 --> 03:43:00,634
MARISHA: She has none of her legendary
resistances right now.

4834
03:43:00,667 --> 03:43:02,601
TRAVIS: No, I'm not worried about those.

4835
03:43:02,634 --> 03:43:06,300
TALIESIN: She--we may
interrupt her mid-slumber.

4836
03:43:06,334 --> 03:43:10,300
MARISHA: How long did it take when, um,

4837
03:43:10,334 --> 03:43:15,467
we injured...was that Vorugal?

4838
03:43:15,501 --> 03:43:17,868
Who retreated
and started healing?

4839
03:43:17,901 --> 03:43:21,334
-LIAM: Umbrasyl.
-MARISHA: Umbrasyl.

4840
03:43:21,367 --> 03:43:24,100
-TRAVIS: In his lair.
-MARISHA: In his lair.

4841
03:43:24,133 --> 03:43:26,100
Doing nothing
but sleeping right?

4842
03:43:26,133 --> 03:43:28,767
MATT: Well, you came upon
a number of empty potions--

4843
03:43:28,801 --> 03:43:31,300
things that were part
of Umbrasyl's hoard.

4844
03:43:31,334 --> 03:43:32,767
LAURA: So Raishan might not have that.

4845
03:43:32,801 --> 03:43:34,100
TALIESIN: Or she might.

4846
03:43:34,133 --> 03:43:36,100
LIAM: But we're gonna get--
if we wait till tomorrow--

4847
03:43:36,133 --> 03:43:38,534
TALIESIN: Which, if she does have it,
she's already taken them.

4848
03:43:38,567 --> 03:43:40,601
LIAM: You all can decide,
but if we go tomorrow,

4849
03:43:40,634 --> 03:43:45,167
she's fully stacked,
she's in her lair.

4850
03:43:45,200 --> 03:43:46,868
If we go tonight--I'm just--

4851
03:43:46,901 --> 03:43:48,267
LAURA: I don't wanna
fucking go tonight.

4852
03:43:48,300 --> 03:43:49,701
I don't wanna go tonight.

4853
03:43:49,734 --> 03:43:51,434
-I don't wanna die again.
-TALIESIN: It's the morning,

4854
03:43:51,467 --> 03:43:53,167
we sleep through the day,
we go tonight.

4855
03:43:53,200 --> 03:43:54,534
LIAM: Well then, there's
nothing to talk about.

4856
03:43:54,567 --> 03:43:56,701
-TALIESIN: I think that's the way to go.
-TRAVIS: Agreed.

4857
03:43:58,033 --> 03:43:59,100
LAURA: We sleep, we go tonight.

4858
03:43:59,133 --> 03:44:00,567
TALIESIN: We sleep, we go tonight.

4859
03:44:00,601 --> 03:44:03,133
She may spend all of today
going through those books,

4860
03:44:03,167 --> 03:44:04,934
and then sleep tonight.

4861
03:44:04,968 --> 03:44:07,100
TRAVIS: Keyleth, we know
what we're asking of you.

4862
03:44:07,133 --> 03:44:08,934
We're asking you to wait, again.

4863
03:44:08,968 --> 03:44:10,934
(chuckling)

4864
03:44:10,968 --> 03:44:13,400
MARISHA: I...

4865
03:44:13,434 --> 03:44:16,827
I think in recent events,
I can wait.

4866
03:44:18,300 --> 03:44:20,934
-SAM: Then at dusk...
-TRAVIS: We plan.

4867
03:44:20,968 --> 03:44:23,334
SAM: Yes.

4868
03:44:23,367 --> 03:44:25,534
(mixed remarks)

4869
03:44:25,567 --> 03:44:28,801
TRAVIS: It's actually dawn--sorry.

4870
03:44:29,801 --> 03:44:31,734
MARISHA: How much do you...

4871
03:44:31,767 --> 03:44:35,234
how much do you heal up
overnight, generally?

4872
03:44:35,267 --> 03:44:37,767
MATT: At night, you get full points,

4873
03:44:37,801 --> 03:44:42,434
and you get back half of your--

4874
03:44:42,467 --> 03:44:45,067
half of your hit dice
that were spent.

4875

03:52:46,367 --> 03:52:48,000
MATT: "I'm sure she did."

5035
03:52:48,033 --> 03:52:50,334
LAURA: I'm sure she'll want
to join us again.

5036
03:52:50,367 --> 03:52:51,934
MATT: "I'm sure she'll
continue to complain

5037
03:52:51,968 --> 03:52:53,701
about things that fly.

5038
03:52:54,667 --> 03:52:57,167
It's never been her strong suit.

5039
03:52:58,567 --> 03:53:01,367
But I'll be there with you,
do not worry.

5040
03:53:03,534 --> 03:53:05,100
Rest well.

5041
03:53:05,133 --> 03:53:09,567
I've had a full night's sleep,
I'm just gonna keep vigil

5042
03:53:09,601 --> 03:53:15,601
and no longer drink things
you procure from your bags

5043
03:53:15,634 --> 03:53:17,434
without inquiring."

5044
03:53:20,767 --> 03:53:24,701
MARISHA: And we all set our alarms
for exactly eight hours.

5045
03:53:24,734 --> 03:53:27,901
LAURA: No sleeping in, and just go.

5046
03:53:27,934 --> 03:53:30,267
LIAM: Siri, wake me up
before Raishan wakes.

5047
03:53:30,300 --> 03:53:32,367
(laughing)

5048
03:53:32,400 --> 03:53:34,300
SAM: (barking)

5049
03:53:34,334 --> 03:53:37,467
MATT: "I'm sorry, I didn't
understand that, Vax'ildan!"

5050
03:53:37,501 --> 03:53:40,834
-TRAVIS: That stupid dog alarm.
-SAM: I love the dog alarm!

5051
03:53:42,801 --> 03:53:45,334
MATT: All right, so as you all
find evening's rest,

5052
03:53:45,367 --> 03:53:47,467
we'll go ahead and end
tonight's session there.

5053
03:53:47,501 --> 03:53:48,968
(cheering)

5054
03:53:49,000 --> 03:53:54,100
Preparing for whatever chaos
the next endeavor unfurls.

5055
03:53:54,133 --> 03:53:56,167
LAURA: Oh, geez.

5056
03:53:56,200 --> 03:53:57,801
-MARISHA: That was a good game.
-LIAM: Yeah.

5057
03:53:57,834 --> 03:53:59,701
MATT: Well done, guys, it's fun.

5058
03:53:59,734 --> 03:54:01,667
MARISHA: Yay, Kerr-bear!

5059
03:54:01,701 --> 03:54:04,133
TRAVIS: Yeah, Patrick!

5060
03:54:04,167 --> 03:54:05,601
PATRICK: It's such a treat--

5061
03:54:05,634 --> 03:54:07,501
such a treat to be able
to come back.

5062
03:54:07,534 --> 03:54:10,167
LIAM: Is there any chance
you'll be here next week?

5063
03:54:10,200 --> 03:54:12,834
PATRICK: Honestly, I was already

5064
03:54:12,868 --> 03:54:14,901
trying to figure
that out in my head.

5065
03:54:14,934 --> 03:54:18,067
Like, it's--I mean,
I've flown places

5066
03:54:18,100 --> 03:54:19,767
for dumber reasons.

5067
03:54:19,801 --> 03:54:21,534
(laughing)

5068
03:54:21,567 --> 03:54:26,734
You know, so I'll maybe
email with you a little bit

5069
03:54:26,767 --> 03:54:27,901
to see how you feel about that.

5070
03:54:27,934 --> 03:54:29,400
MATT: Let me know, I mean,
we'd love to have you.

5071
03:54:29,434 --> 03:54:30,601
LIAM: Get you in some combat!

5072
03:54:30,634 --> 03:54:33,000
-LAURA: Yeah!
-PATRICK: I will admit I've never--

5073
03:54:33,033 --> 03:54:35,200
LAURA: You had a pretty
awesome hammer there!

5074
03:54:35,234 --> 03:54:37,767
PATRICK: I, uh--I have yet
to actually take him

5075
03:54:37,801 --> 03:54:40,067
for a test drive
in that way, so...

for one divine hammer ♪♪

The Breeder's, man,

5079
03:54:48,601 --> 03:54:49,634

-MATT: We'll try and coordinate

5080
03:54:49,667 --> 03:54:50,701
for that--hopefully
it works out,

5081
03:54:50,734 --> 03:54:52,067
'cause that would be great.

5082
