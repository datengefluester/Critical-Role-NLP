1
00:00:01,015 --> 00:00:10,789
(cheering)

2
00:00:10,789 --> 00:00:15,169
BRIAN: What's up? We've got, like, a Keyleth's
hair of cables down here to get through. How are

3
00:00:15,169 --> 00:00:16,484
you guys?

4
00:00:16,484 --> 00:00:17,563
(cheering)

5
00:00:17,563 --> 00:00:25,172
BRIAN: I know it's early. Thank you for lining up
and for coming, and man. Where's Manleth at? I saw

6
00:00:25,172 --> 00:00:38,161
on Twitter. Yes! That is awesome. You look great!
That's cool. Come get some free shit after. Oh, I

7
00:00:38,161 --> 00:00:45,086
forgot, there's a note here. There may be some
people under 18 years of age. It also says, your

8
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:49,965
kids are better off in a hot car than in a room
with Sam Riegel. If there's--

9
00:00:49,965 --> 00:00:54,405
(laughter)

10
00:00:54,405 --> 00:01:04,308
BRIAN: Oh, man. Going to check the lock on my
hotel room. Quick reminder: this panel will air in

11
00:01:04,308 --> 00:01:11,546
its entirety Tuesday night, 7:00PM, in our normal
time slot on Twitch and Alpha, 7:00PM Pacific, so

12
00:01:11,546 --> 00:01:22,511
tune in, listen for your voice not laughing at my
jokes. Lastly, before I bring out my guests for

13
00:01:22,511 --> 00:01:28,022
this panel, we're going to have a Q&amp;A for about
probably second half to three quarters of the

14
00:01:28,022 --> 00:01:37,840
panel. The mic is here. Thank you, Vanna. If you
get up to the mic and you get your question asked,

15
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:45,747
come up and get a Free Denise pin. Who has the
Free Denise pins? Denise!

16
00:01:45,747 --> 00:01:47,813
(cheering)

17
00:01:47,813 --> 00:01:50,169
BRIAN: Stand up, Denise! Stand up!

18
00:01:50,169 --> 00:01:54,582
(cheering)

19
00:01:54,582 --> 00:02:01,618
BRIAN: Come get a Free Denise pin from Denise if
you get your question asked today. That's awesome.

20
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:07,462
A lot of people still ask me if she's real or not.
Please don't pinch her to find out if it's true,

21
00:02:07,462 --> 00:02:14,280
but you can say hi. Just be polite. #boundaries.
Without further or-do, I would like to bring out

22
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,030
my guests, the cast of Critical Role.

23
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,687
(cheering)

24
00:02:21,687 --> 00:02:24,027
BRIAN: Travis Willingham!

25
00:02:24,027 --> 00:02:27,565
(cheering)

26
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:29,362
BRIAN: Marisha Ray!

27
00:02:29,362 --> 00:02:31,783
(cheering)

28
00:02:31,783 --> 00:02:33,742
BRIAN: Taliesin Jaffe!

29
00:02:33,742 --> 00:02:36,668
(cheering)

30
00:02:36,668 --> 00:02:38,973
BRIAN: Ashley Johnson!

31
00:02:38,973 --> 00:02:42,666
(cheering)

32
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,616
BRIAN: Sam Riegel!

33
00:02:44,616 --> 00:02:47,931
(cheering)

34
00:02:47,931 --> 00:02:51,291
BRIAN: Liam O'Brien!

35
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:55,136
(cheering)

36
00:02:55,136 --> 00:02:57,687
BRIAN: Laura Bailey!

37
00:02:57,687 --> 00:03:00,646
(cheering)

38
00:03:00,646 --> 00:03:03,046
BRIAN: And Matthew Mercer!

39
00:03:03,046 --> 00:03:11,664
(cheering)

40
00:03:11,664 --> 00:03:16,265
LAURA: I feel like this chair is really low.

41
00:03:16,265 --> 00:03:19,294
BRIAN: Do we have any phone books you could sit
on?

42
00:03:19,294 --> 00:03:21,217
MATT: Get a Comic Con booster seat. It'll be
good.

43
00:03:21,217 --> 00:03:23,799
LAURA: Excuse me.

44
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:28,154
BRIAN: We'll get one requested for next year.

45
00:03:28,154 --> 00:03:30,843
TRAVIS: It is like an elementary school chair.

46
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:32,323
MARISHA: It is very-- yeah.

47
00:03:32,323 --> 00:03:33,860
TALIESIN: I feel like I need a booster.

48
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,438
MARISHA: Yeah, I feel like I need a desk in front
of me.

49
00:03:36,438 --> 00:03:38,193
MATT: Hello, everyone!

50
00:03:38,193 --> 00:03:39,445
BRIAN: Hello!

51
00:03:39,445 --> 00:03:42,324
(cheering)

52
00:03:42,324 --> 00:03:47,130
MATT: Can I just say how happy I am that this many
people came out to join us on the godawful early

53
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:51,057
10:30AM on a Saturday at Comic Con? That's
amazing!

54
00:03:51,057 --> 00:03:57,060
(cheering)

55
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:03,764
BRIAN: Yes. I agree. Well, we're going to talk a
little bit about the recent events of Critical

56
00:04:03,764 --> 00:04:07,805
Role, we're going to talk a little bit about-- we
have a couple announcements, and then we're going

57
00:04:07,869 --> 00:04:11,446
to take your guys' questions. I'll tell you when
to line up in just a minute. But first, Matt, I

58
00:04:11,446 --> 00:04:16,472
think there's a pretty big announcement that we
were saving for San Diego Comic Con, if you want

59
00:04:16,472 --> 00:04:18,416
to fill everybody in on what that might be.

60
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:20,095
MATT: Glad you guys could be here for this.

61
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,810
BRIAN: Oh, man!

62
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:26,745
MARISHA: Sorry, I was just hype-manning you. Yeah!
What?

63
00:04:26,745 --> 00:04:29,151
SAM: We're starting with big reveals already?

64
00:04:29,151 --> 00:04:31,789
BRIAN: Yes, Sam! The people have waited!

65
00:04:31,789 --> 00:04:33,553
SAM: Aren't we supposed to wait to build tension
or--

66
00:04:33,553 --> 00:04:34,943
BRIAN: No!

67
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:37,400
MATT: We're Vox Machina. We've never done anything
the right way.

68
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,330
(laughter)

69
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,147
LAURA: I'm surprised we made it to this room.

70
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:44,074
MARISHA: Besides, people leave at the end of
panels. We all know this. They want to get to Game

71
00:04:44,074 --> 00:04:45,134
of Thrones.

72
00:04:45,134 --> 00:04:46,345
MATT: I know.

73
00:04:46,345 --> 00:04:48,012
LIAM: I don't want to sit on it any more, Matt.

74
00:04:48,012 --> 00:04:52,373
MATT: All right. So. We've been working on this
for a little bit, but we finally get to announce

75
00:04:52,373 --> 00:04:56,409
that we're making a Critical Role comic book.

76
00:04:56,409 --> 00:05:00,825
(cheering)

77
00:05:00,825 --> 00:05:08,575
MATT: It's going to be a telling of the origin
story of Vox Machina. How they first met, how they

78
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:15,796
became a group, and then all the adventures you
didn't get to see that were all pre-stream. Super

79
00:05:15,796 --> 00:05:26,956
excited about that! Couple other cool parts of
this are, one, we were trying to find a person who

80
00:05:26,956 --> 00:05:31,957
could write this properly and we could only really
think of a close friend of ours who's a fantastic

81
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:39,989
writer named Matt Colville. So super excited to
have him onboard and finally be able to announce

82
00:05:39,989 --> 00:05:44,312
his involvement. His "secret project" for months
and months that he hasn't been able to talk about.

83
00:05:44,312 --> 00:05:52,109
You can finally talk about it, Colville, you're
good. He's penning it, he's the actual words. And

84
00:05:52,109 --> 00:05:56,863
then to find the artist for it, one of our big
things about Critical Role is to try to find a way

85
00:05:56,863 --> 00:06:01,203
to lift the community and help get people the
opportunities that they deserve for this.

86
00:06:01,203 --> 00:06:08,929
SAM: I'm doing the art. It's me. I'm drawing it.
Thank you. Yeah, I'm really excited about it. A

87
00:06:08,929 --> 00:06:10,918
lot of splash pages.

88
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:16,283
BRIAN: If you saw Tary's art, you know what you're
in for. Save your money.

89
00:06:16,283 --> 00:06:20,926
SAM: Sorry, Matt, go on.

90
00:06:20,926 --> 00:06:26,811
MATT: It's okay. We had a bunch of artists thrown
at us, but we wanted to pick somebody from the

91
00:06:26,811 --> 00:06:31,855
community where you've seen their incredible work.
The one we kept coming to is an artist named

92
00:06:31,855 --> 00:06:36,394
Olivia Samson in the Critical Role art community,
and she has agreed to be the artist for the first

93
00:06:36,394 --> 00:06:39,565
six-issue run. We have a couple examples here we
can show you.

94
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:42,768
SAM: Reveal! Reveal! Reveal!

95
00:06:42,768 --> 00:06:49,370
MATT: Here's some of the early lineart that she's
done. It takes place in Stillben in the

96
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,606
surrounding K'Tawl Swamp.

97
00:06:51,606 --> 00:06:53,335
LAURA: I recognize those half-elves.

98
00:06:53,335 --> 00:07:00,398
MATT: We have a couple pages where we can show the
progression of some of the early art design and

99
00:07:00,398 --> 00:07:06,171
coloring. Over on the next page. There we go. Show
some of the later--

100
00:07:06,171 --> 00:07:07,774
TRAVIS: Eyeballs!

101
00:07:07,774 --> 00:07:11,672
LAURA: Don't give away too much!

102
00:07:11,672 --> 00:07:15,623
MATT: No, this is just a couple pages, don't
worry. Then we go to the next one. One of the

103
00:07:15,623 --> 00:07:18,171
early color layouts there.

104
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:22,889
SAM: Vax is the one with the bow and arrow,
right?

105
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:29,401
MATT: Yeah, that's the one. Then we move onto the
actual character art layouts that she had done for

106
00:07:29,401 --> 00:07:32,064
some of the designs.

107
00:07:32,064 --> 00:07:41,655
SAM: It's been a wig on Keyleth the whole time.
Big reveal!

108
00:07:41,655 --> 00:07:47,815
(laughter)

109
00:07:47,815 --> 00:07:53,217
MATT: And then the final example of what the final
color and art's going to look like in the book.

110
00:07:53,217 --> 00:07:57,735
We're excited to give you guys this first look.

111
00:07:57,735 --> 00:08:10,596
MARISHA: We were going to call it Vox Machina
Assemble, but apparently that's already taken. So

112
00:08:10,596 --> 00:08:13,142
still working on the name.

113
00:08:13,142 --> 00:08:17,295
BRIAN: Matt, is there a release date announced, or
a window in which it will be?

114
00:08:17,295 --> 00:08:19,816
MATT: That information is to come soon.

115
00:08:19,816 --> 00:08:22,380
BRIAN: I'm asking on behalf of the audience.

116
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,160
ASHLEY: (British accent) On behalf?

117
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,872
BRIAN: (British accent) On behalf of the audience
who will be tweeting us the same question for the

118
00:08:27,872 --> 00:08:28,986
next six months.

119
00:08:28,986 --> 00:08:32,842
MATT: I understand. We will have that information
official to you as soon as possible. I guarantee

120
00:08:32,842 --> 00:08:37,464
you at least you'll see something in your hands by
the end of the year.

121
00:08:37,464 --> 00:08:46,544
BRIAN: Before the end of the year. That's amazing.
Well, in an orderly fashion, if some of you want

122
00:08:46,544 --> 00:08:52,708
to line up for questions, we're going to start
taking those in a minute. Orderly! Love each

123
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:59,486
other! Respect, love each other! Oh my god, is
that donuts?

124
00:08:59,486 --> 00:09:05,203
TRAVIS: They're loaded with LSD. Do not eat them!
We'll be tripping balls.

125
00:09:05,203 --> 00:09:09,949
BRIAN: Denise, get this girl a car.

126
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,998
LAURA: This is my favorite panel!

127
00:09:11,998 --> 00:09:16,015
SAM: Hey, we got a Pike over here. Who wants a
donut?

128
00:09:16,015 --> 00:09:19,627
BRIAN: While you guys are lining up--

129
00:09:19,627 --> 00:09:23,781
ASHLEY: Wait, bring them back! Hey, man, come on!

130
00:09:23,781 --> 00:09:26,162
BRIAN: You know better than to do that.

131
00:09:26,162 --> 00:09:36,332
MARISHA: This way. Thank you! And here, Travis.
And bye, box of donuts. I love you!

132
00:09:36,332 --> 00:09:37,999
TRAVIS: Thank you!

133
00:09:37,999 --> 00:09:46,548
BRIAN: You're awesome. What's your name? Kiana?
That's a beautiful name. While you guys are

134
00:09:46,548 --> 00:09:49,999
thinking of your questions, Sam and I were talking
before the show and there's actually a couple

135
00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:56,080
other big reveals that we wanted to announce at
this Comic Con panel. First of all, season three

136
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,803
of Critical Role has already been written and you
guys are going to love it. We were in the hotel

137
00:10:01,803 --> 00:10:07,887
room this morning going over episodes 200 and
whatever and it was, my god!

138
00:10:07,887 --> 00:10:09,568
(laughter)

139
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:15,796
SAM: One of the big reveals-- Matt is going to
reveal that Victor, beloved character Victor, he

140
00:10:15,796 --> 00:10:19,994
just had lead poisoning. He gets treatment and
he's totally normal now.

141
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,631
BRIAN: What would that sound like, Matt?

142
00:10:22,631 --> 00:10:27,301
MATT: (Victor voice) I apologize if it's been at
all difficult to have made a fool of myself in a

143
00:10:27,301 --> 00:10:32,381
public venue. However, I am happy to sell any sort
of black powder to you if you come by my place.

144
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,603
SAM: Love the new twist.

145
00:10:34,603 --> 00:10:38,118
LAURA: Still very charming.

146
00:10:38,118 --> 00:10:44,450
BRIAN: Sam, some of the upcoming guests for
Critical Role coming up in season three: the

147
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:55,002
current and former cast of The View, including, it
says here on the card, Star Jones and some of the

148
00:10:55,002 --> 00:10:56,464
Dance Moms.

149
00:10:56,464 --> 00:10:58,492
TRAVIS: Excited about that.

150
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:01,323
BRIAN: Once you have Jon Heder, you can get
anybody.

151
00:11:01,323 --> 00:11:03,125
TRAVIS: The world opens up.

152
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,686
TALIESIN: It's all downhill from there.

153
00:11:04,686 --> 00:11:08,351
BRIAN: And lastly, the big reveal was that Vex and
Vax are married now.

154
00:11:08,351 --> 00:11:10,867
(groaning)

155
00:11:10,867 --> 00:11:13,132
SAM: To each other. Boom!

156
00:11:13,132 --> 00:11:19,112
BRIAN: Travis has come out as a Redskins fan, it
says here--

157
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:34,452
(exclamations, cheering)

158
00:11:34,452 --> 00:11:40,293
BRIAN: And finally, it says Liam and Sam are now
legally separated in real life.

159
00:11:40,293 --> 00:11:42,858
SAM: Because he married his sister, so.

160
00:11:42,858 --> 00:11:46,905
BRIAN: (laughs) He did, he did. Okay, let's take
some questions. Go ahead.

161
00:11:46,905 --> 00:11:49,241
LIAM: You said you were cool with anything.

162
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:52,308
BRIAN: Tell us your name, please.

163
00:11:52,308 --> 00:11:53,960
ANDI: Hi, my name is Andi--

164
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,473
MARISHA and MATT: Hi Andi!

165
00:11:55,473 --> 00:12:00,343
ANDI: Hi! So Brian I took the day off today, so
I'm not working this time.

166
00:12:00,343 --> 00:12:02,412
BRIAN: Oh, was that you at Wondercon?

167
00:12:02,412 --> 00:12:03,950
ANDI: Yeah. My mom's sitting right there.

168
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:08,611
BRIAN: Aww, hey, mom! That's awesome. She was
working and couldn't come to the last Wondercon

169
00:12:08,611 --> 00:12:15,370
panel, so I told her I would go to your work and
say hi and I got lost on the way. Thank you for

170
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,239
coming. What's your question?

171
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:21,190
ANDI: My question is for everybody. What's been
your favorite story arc so far?

172
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:26,741
(thinking noises)

173
00:12:26,741 --> 00:12:30,637
MARISHA: Going through the 500 hours that we've--

174
00:12:30,637 --> 00:12:33,362
TRAVIS: I think it was when Keyleth exploded as a
goldfish.

175
00:12:33,362 --> 00:12:39,275
(cheering, applause)

176
00:12:39,275 --> 00:12:40,866
TRAVIS: Is that an arc, or--

177
00:12:40,866 --> 00:12:43,304
BRIAN: That's not an arc, but that's the right
answer!

178
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:46,026
MARISHA: There's a lot of math on it online.

179
00:12:46,026 --> 00:12:47,812
TRAVIS: Might be a straight line--

180
00:12:47,812 --> 00:12:49,312
MARISHA: More of a parabola--

181
00:12:49,312 --> 00:12:51,828
LIAM: I believe the lack of arc was the problem.

182
00:12:51,828 --> 00:12:54,927
MARISHA: I thought the joke would break my fall.

183
00:12:54,927 --> 00:13:02,446
TALIESIN: I was sick for cows, so I got to sit at
home with a fever and watch the cow episode and be

184
00:13:02,446 --> 00:13:06,362
like, (loopy voice) This is so nice! I like this!
It's great!

185
00:13:06,362 --> 00:13:08,395
LAURA: I can't believe you weren't there for the
cow episode!

186
00:13:08,395 --> 00:13:11,180
TALIESIN: I know, I've been like retconned into
it--

187
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,608
MARISHA: (gasps) That's right! There was that
fanart!

188
00:13:13,608 --> 00:13:14,727
TALIESIN: None of you ever remember.

189
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:17,784
MARISHA: There was that fanart where we all come
back as cows and Percy's like, what?

190
00:13:17,784 --> 00:13:19,842
TALIESIN: Everybody was like, remember when we did
that? And I was like, I didn't do that. And you're

191
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:21,825
like, yeah remember when we all did that, and
like, fuck--

192
00:13:21,825 --> 00:13:23,874
(laughter)

193
00:13:23,874 --> 00:13:25,385
ASHLEY: Did you go?

194
00:13:25,385 --> 00:13:27,942
MARISHA: I mean, there's no--

195
00:13:27,942 --> 00:13:29,361
TRAVIS: It's a free-for-all.

196
00:13:29,361 --> 00:13:33,081
ASHLEY: I really liked the Briarwood arc. I really
did.

197
00:13:33,081 --> 00:13:41,222
SAM: Oh, I have to answer too? The one we're on
right now is pretty cool, because we get to hang

198
00:13:41,222 --> 00:13:48,690
out with gods and stuff-- no spoilers. But yeah,
it's interesting. I have no idea what's going to

199
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:52,753
happen because I barely know how D&amp;D works.

200
00:13:52,753 --> 00:13:58,353
LIAM: I honestly can't remember anything beyond
meeting Sprigg. I'm just all Sprigg right now.

201
00:13:58,353 --> 00:14:00,552
(cheering)

202
00:14:00,552 --> 00:14:03,797
BRIAN: Where is Darin De Paul? Yes! There he is!

203
00:14:03,797 --> 00:14:09,001
(cheering)

204
00:14:09,001 --> 00:14:10,312
BRIAN: We love you, Darin.

205
00:14:10,312 --> 00:14:13,607
MARISHA: Darin De Paul in the house! Yeah,
Sprigg's amazing.

206
00:14:13,607 --> 00:14:14,916
TRAVIS and LAURA: Yeah.

207
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:17,140
MATT: (ominous voice) It's a shame he has to die.

208
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,823
LAURA: Oh no! Matthew!

209
00:14:18,823 --> 00:14:21,350
BRIAN: Not cool, dude.

210
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:27,534
LAURA: I liked the visit to the Nine Hells.

211
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,800
MATT: That was a fun one.

212
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,646
LAURA: Yeah, that was great.

213
00:14:31,646 --> 00:14:38,153
MATT: Only because it took two and a half years
for me to have happen and then it hit and then it

214
00:14:38,153 --> 00:14:41,921
lasted a year which may have been a little long, but
you can't guide the length of the narrative in

215
00:14:42,008 --> 00:14:44,741
D&amp;D. The Conclave arc, definitely, was a fun one.

216
00:14:44,741 --> 00:14:48,600
(cheering)

217
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,872
MATT: Thank you very much.

218
00:14:50,872 --> 00:14:52,636
BRIAN: Who's next?

219
00:14:52,636 --> 00:14:55,005
MARISHA and MATT: (gasping) Lucy!

220
00:14:55,005 --> 00:14:57,399
MARISHA: You're awesome.

221
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:06,568
LUCY: Thank you. I'm Christina, but call me Lucy.
There's a 5th-level druid spell called

222
00:15:06,568 --> 00:15:13,063
Reincarnation, and if Pike wasn't around and you
guys had to be reincarnated, which means you come

223
00:15:13,063 --> 00:15:17,981
back with your memories but you have a different
body, what would you like your character to be

224
00:15:17,981 --> 00:15:20,361
reincarnated as?

225
00:15:20,361 --> 00:15:21,843
MARISHA: What we would like them to be?

226
00:15:21,843 --> 00:15:22,969
LUCY: Ideally.

227
00:15:22,969 --> 00:15:24,414
LAURA: But we don't get to choose, right?

228
00:15:24,414 --> 00:15:27,335
MATT: Right. But if you <i>could</i> choose, what would
it be?

229
00:15:27,335 --> 00:15:28,594
LAURA: Okay.

230
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:34,314
LUCY: For Matt, if there's an NPC that you would
prefer to die and be reincarnated--

231
00:15:34,314 --> 00:15:38,660
MATT: Oh. Kima as a wolverine.

232
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,215
(cheering)

233
00:15:41,215 --> 00:15:44,600
MATT: That's more old-school D&amp;D, because back
then you could return them back as an animal,

234
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,917
which was fun.

235
00:15:45,917 --> 00:15:51,159
LAURA: You can come back as animals?

236
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:54,791
MATT: In older editions, yeah.

237
00:15:54,791 --> 00:16:03,900
LAURA: That's cool. I don't know. I would like to
come back as a half-celestial. Can you do that?

238
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:08,058
MATT: That is an aasimar, that's the two boys that
you met--

239
00:16:08,058 --> 00:16:11,457
LAURA: Yeah, that's what I want. I want blue hair,
man. Slightly blue skin and blue hair.

240
00:16:11,457 --> 00:16:12,589
MATT: Perfect.

241
00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:18,508
LIAM: Why go off-brand? What are they called,
kuatoa? What are the little bird folk?

242
00:16:18,508 --> 00:16:19,876
MATT: The frog guys?

243
00:16:19,876 --> 00:16:24,614
LIAM: No, the birds-- the little raven or
were-raven--

244
00:16:24,614 --> 00:16:26,601
AUDIENCE: Kenku!

245
00:16:26,601 --> 00:16:27,859
LIAM: Kenku! Thank you!

246
00:16:27,859 --> 00:16:28,940
LAURA: That's perfect.

247
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:37,275
MARISHA: I'm now envisioning Vax as Bird Person
from Rick and Morty. "Hi. Dagger dagger dagger."

248
00:16:37,275 --> 00:16:40,993
LIAM: There are four more, keep going.

249
00:16:40,993 --> 00:16:55,846
SAM: I'd love to see Scanlan as an ordinary human,
like a George Takei-type, in body and voice.

250
00:16:55,846 --> 00:16:58,322
(George Takei voice) Hello.

251
00:16:58,322 --> 00:17:00,543
MATT: Spoiler, we're replacing Sam with George
Takei.

252
00:17:00,543 --> 00:17:02,995
SAM: (George Takei voice) Oh my.

253
00:17:02,995 --> 00:17:06,395
LIAM: (George Takei voice) Bigby's Hand.

254
00:17:06,395 --> 00:17:12,802
BRIAN: That's really good!

255
00:17:12,802 --> 00:17:25,097
ASHLEY: I feel like Pike would probably come back
as an otter, or something and be like, oh no. That

256
00:17:25,097 --> 00:17:34,318
wasn't the plan. I was thinking like a
regular-sized whatever. I think I could be a

257
00:17:34,318 --> 00:17:36,469
little bit taller, sometimes.

258
00:17:36,469 --> 00:17:40,572
LIAM: The second coming of Vox Machina rises out
of the water right in the middle, an otter pokes

259
00:17:40,572 --> 00:17:42,099
up a head.

260
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:48,784
ASHLEY: Oh no! I'm even shorter now!

261
00:17:48,784 --> 00:17:56,088
TALIESIN: I love the idea of, completely random,
but the whole notion of coming back as a pixie,

262
00:17:56,088 --> 00:18:00,383
just a teeny tiny, dammit Na'vi level of (nyoom
noises).

263
00:18:00,383 --> 00:18:01,461
ASHLEY: Pixies!

264
00:18:01,461 --> 00:18:02,864
LIAM: Oh, the indignation.

265
00:18:02,864 --> 00:18:06,247
MARISHA: I'd be all about a half-orc Keyleth.

266
00:18:06,247 --> 00:18:14,061
TRAVIS: I'm pretty sure Grog would want to come
back as anything with breasts.

267
00:18:14,061 --> 00:18:17,236
(laughter)

268
00:18:17,236 --> 00:18:18,636
TALIESIN: Chicken it is, all right.

269
00:18:18,636 --> 00:18:20,241
TRAVIS: He'd never leave his room.

270
00:18:20,241 --> 00:18:23,941
(laughter)

271
00:18:23,941 --> 00:18:26,499
BRIAN: Yeah, that sounds about right.

272
00:18:26,499 --> 00:18:30,466
MATT: Is that when he retires from adventuring?
(Grog voice) I'm good!

273
00:18:30,466 --> 00:18:33,249
LAURA: I've got it!

274
00:18:33,249 --> 00:18:34,436
MATT: Plenty of things to do!

275
00:18:34,436 --> 00:18:36,355
TRAVIS: Let me know when you get back!

276
00:18:36,355 --> 00:18:42,576
BRIAN: Can't wait to see the Titanstone Pasties.

277
00:18:42,576 --> 00:18:51,981
(laughter)

278
00:18:51,981 --> 00:18:55,017
BRIAN: All right. Did everybody answer?

279
00:18:55,017 --> 00:18:58,269
MARISHA: Aww, that's going to happen now? You put
that into the world!

280
00:18:58,269 --> 00:19:05,654
BRIAN: All right, you artists that I call upon for
the really twisted shit, you know who you are. And

281
00:19:05,654 --> 00:19:07,521
I will say, go! Do it!

282
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,740
MARISHA: Go Tess go! Go, do it!

283
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:13,082
MATT: In canon, the Titanstone Pasties do have
tassels.

284
00:19:13,082 --> 00:19:17,939
LUCY: I am both sorry and very much not sorry for
starting this.

285
00:19:17,939 --> 00:19:24,870
BRIAN: No, you did good. Make sure to see Denise
after and get a Free Denise pen.

286
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:25,962
TALIESIN: I would like to rage.

287
00:19:25,962 --> 00:19:31,627
BRIAN: Hey, what's your name?

288
00:19:31,627 --> 00:19:33,339
ELEVATOR GUY: Elevator Guy.

289
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:37,992
BRIAN: Elevator Guy! That's a terrible name, but
I'm not going to judge your parents.

290
00:19:37,992 --> 00:19:46,710
ELEVATOR GUY: Yeah. Clearly they hate me. My
question is for Ashley Johnson and Love Actually's

291
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,489
Martin Freeman.

292
00:19:48,489 --> 00:19:56,234
(laughter)

293
00:19:56,234 --> 00:20:00,316
TRAVIS: You broke Laura!

294
00:20:00,316 --> 00:20:04,202
BRIAN: Do the impression! Do the impression,
Liam!

295
00:20:04,202 --> 00:20:10,392
LIAM: Bilbo Baggins.

296
00:20:10,392 --> 00:20:15,826
ELEVATOR GUY: So in Sam and Liam's podcast, Liam,
you mentioned that you went to NYU, and, well, I'm

297
00:20:15,826 --> 00:20:20,517
going in the fall for the first time, and Ashley,
you live in New York a lot of the time, so I was

298
00:20:20,517 --> 00:20:23,604
wondering if you guys had any tips for a
first-time New Yorker.

299
00:20:23,604 --> 00:20:27,280
LIAM: Tips for a first-time New Yorker?

300
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,581
BRIAN: Get used to the smell of pee.

301
00:20:28,581 --> 00:20:36,691
ASHLEY: Walk everywhere. Walk as much as you can.
Obviously go to Central Park.

302
00:20:36,691 --> 00:20:38,622
LIAM: Get a can of mace.

303
00:20:38,622 --> 00:20:41,078
(laughter)

304
00:20:41,078 --> 00:20:42,792
SAM: Don't make eye contact with anyone.

305
00:20:42,792 --> 00:20:44,461
ASHLEY: Wait, when are you going?

306
00:20:44,461 --> 00:20:45,748
ELEVATOR GUY: August 25.

307
00:20:45,748 --> 00:20:51,584
ASHLEY: Okay, so if you go into Central Park
almost when it's dark, which I know sounds a

308
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:57,512
little sketchy, there are so many fireflies, so
that would be really cool.

309
00:20:57,512 --> 00:21:00,840
BRIAN: She's going to steal your wallet, dude.

310
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,800
(laughter)

311
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:08,397
BRIAN: This is-- no. Two seconds of googling,
you'll see, there are no fireflies.

312
00:21:08,397 --> 00:21:11,238
TRAVIS: Behind the boathouse. Come alone.

313
00:21:11,238 --> 00:21:18,388
TALIESIN: There's a big mermaid festival on Coney
Island I think that's coming up. Super cool.

314
00:21:18,388 --> 00:21:22,169
ASHLEY: Yeah, it might be around that time? Yeah.
It's at Coney Island.

315
00:21:22,169 --> 00:21:27,678
MARISHA: Is Bryant Park still doing the summer
movie festivals where you can do free movies? New

316
00:21:27,678 --> 00:21:28,965
York's amazing.

317
00:21:28,965 --> 00:21:34,030
SAM: When we were in New York last, all of us, we
went to Chelsea Piers, and we all did a golf

318
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:36,869
driving range together, and we were terrible.

319
00:21:36,869 --> 00:21:40,906
BRIAN: I have a lot of videos of that. I should
post those. I have videos of each one of you guys

320
00:21:40,906 --> 00:21:44,480
doing golf swings in slow-motion, and some of them
are painful.

321
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,869
(laughter)

322
00:21:46,869 --> 00:21:50,583
LIAM: You can see most shows on Broadway for free
by volunteering to usher.

323
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,088
SAM: Or by sneaking in.

324
00:21:52,088 --> 00:21:57,411
MARISHA: Or by being a student. Flash that student
ID card everywhere.

325
00:21:57,411 --> 00:22:02,029
ASHLEY: Yeah. And go to Di Fara Pizza in Brooklyn
for a Grandma Slice.

326
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,143
TRAVIS: You're writing all this down, right?

327
00:22:04,143 --> 00:22:08,301
BRIAN: Yeah, watch Tuesday night with a notepad.

328
00:22:08,301 --> 00:22:16,621
SAM: The next three questions of mine are, what's
there to do in Cincinnati? What part of West

329
00:22:16,621 --> 00:22:18,342
Hollywood should I live in?

330
00:22:18,342 --> 00:22:19,888
ELEVATOR GUY: All right. Thank you very much.

331
00:22:19,888 --> 00:22:21,529
BRIAN: Thank you, man, that was great.

332
00:22:21,529 --> 00:22:25,227
MATT: That's our next book release, is Vox
Machina's guide to travel.

333
00:22:25,227 --> 00:22:26,995
LAURA: Oh my god, that would be great.

334
00:22:26,995 --> 00:22:28,940
LIAM: Tyriok's guide?

335
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,601
MICHELLE: Hello.

336
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:33,261
BRIAN: Hello. What's your name?

337
00:22:33,261 --> 00:22:34,594
MICHELLE: I'm Michelle.

338
00:22:34,594 --> 00:22:36,079
LAURA and MARISHA: Hi, Michelle.

339
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:45,069
MICHELLE: Hi. So my question is, if you have to do
a trial by combat, and can only pick one other

340
00:22:45,069 --> 00:22:49,860
ally, and that can include guest characters, who
would you summon and why?

341
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:55,161
MARISHA: Like, across all universes or in ours?

342
00:22:55,161 --> 00:22:58,499
SAM: Ours. Let's limit it a little.

343
00:22:58,499 --> 00:23:00,983
(laughter)

344
00:23:00,983 --> 00:23:02,551
BRIAN: Yeah, it's an hour panel.

345
00:23:02,551 --> 00:23:07,033
LAURA: Wait, I need a question clarification. Is
this all of us as Vox Machina doing a trial by

346
00:23:07,033 --> 00:23:09,742
combat and then summoning one ally, or each
individually?

347
00:23:09,742 --> 00:23:11,427
MICHELLE: Each individually.

348
00:23:11,427 --> 00:23:14,065
TRAVIS: Can we pick Pelor, like, the Dawnfather?

349
00:23:14,065 --> 00:23:16,718
TALIESIN: Player character, motherfucker, player
character.

350
00:23:16,718 --> 00:23:25,025
SAM: I'm going to pick the character of Noelle
Stevenson as Tova. Oh, wait, she's right over

351
00:23:25,025 --> 00:23:26,630
there in the audience!

352
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:33,997
BRIAN: Oh, Noelle Stevenson is here, too! Wow.
This is an all-star panel.

353
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:37,199
AUDIENCE: If she's still alive!

354
00:23:37,199 --> 00:23:39,569
SAM: Yeah, she's totally dead. Totally dead.

355
00:23:39,569 --> 00:23:41,019
LIAM: You hush your mouth!

356
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,781
(laughter)

357
00:23:42,781 --> 00:23:48,462
MARISHA: I think, based on our last Battle Royale,
and me and you going toe-to-toe, it'd be me and

358
00:23:48,462 --> 00:23:49,797
you to the end, man.

359
00:23:49,797 --> 00:23:51,033
TRAVIS: Word.

360
00:23:51,033 --> 00:23:53,895
MARISHA: We'd be terrible to take on. We'd never
die.

361
00:23:53,895 --> 00:23:58,159
TRAVIS: That's true. I'd pick the werewolf,
because as soon as he started to die, I'd be like,

362
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,042
bite me, dude. Just bite me.

363
00:24:02,042 --> 00:24:07,816
LIAM: I mean, everybody should pick Keyleth. She's
the most powerful character in the group.

364
00:24:07,816 --> 00:24:11,204
LAURA: But only with allies that we've traveled
with. Not Vox Machina.

365
00:24:11,204 --> 00:24:20,387
LIAM: Not Vox Machina? Keyleth would be a great
ally. No. Come back to me, then.

366
00:24:20,387 --> 00:24:21,939
LAURA: Allura.

367
00:24:21,939 --> 00:24:24,870
LIAM: Do they have to be a friend? Could they have
been an enemy?

368
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:27,082
LAURA: But is it a trial by fisticuffs?

369
00:24:27,082 --> 00:24:31,742
MARISHA: Man, we are way overcomplicating this. We
are overthinking this way too much.

370
00:24:31,742 --> 00:24:33,744
LAURA: I just need to know.

371
00:24:33,744 --> 00:24:41,127
MARISHA: People wonder why Vox Machina does this.
We're just like this.

372
00:24:41,127 --> 00:24:45,935
LIAM: I mean, part of me would like to run with
Delilah Briarwood. Yeah.

373
00:24:45,935 --> 00:24:50,076
LAURA: I feel like Vex is getting close to that
anyways, so.

374
00:24:50,076 --> 00:24:52,040
TALIESIN: Wow.

375
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:57,277
ASHLEY: I feel like I'd have to go with my
tried-and-true. My bestie, Grog. I do actually

376
00:24:57,277 --> 00:25:05,422
feel like we would be a really good combo, though.
Because you're the brains and I'm the brawn.

377
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:07,799
(laughter)

378
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:11,862
TRAVIS: You just keep healing me, we'll just keep
smashing them? Yeah. Like Overwatch tag-team.

379
00:25:11,862 --> 00:25:15,905
MATT: Awesome, thank you so much.

380
00:25:15,905 --> 00:25:19,594
MARISHA: This makes me want an Injustice Critical
Role DLC.

381
00:25:19,594 --> 00:25:23,208
TALIESIN: We've got like a third of it already.

382
00:25:23,208 --> 00:25:24,947
LAURA: That would be awesome.

383
00:25:24,947 --> 00:25:26,594
BRIAN: Hey, what's your name?

384
00:25:26,594 --> 00:25:28,223
BRETT: My name is Brett.

385
00:25:28,223 --> 00:25:32,837
BRIAN: You can touch it, it's not electrical.
Electrocuted. That'd be a good prank, though.

386
00:25:32,837 --> 00:25:36,188
(laughter)

387
00:25:36,188 --> 00:25:42,162
BRETT: So my question is, if you could replace
your player character with any NPC, which one

388
00:25:42,162 --> 00:25:43,658
would you play?

389
00:25:43,658 --> 00:25:45,970
SAM: Similar, but different question.

390
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:48,261
ASHLEY: Victor. Yeah, Victor.

391
00:25:48,261 --> 00:25:55,483
TALIESIN: I would go Gilmore super-fast. So much
fun. (Gilmore voice) I just love doing that voice

392
00:25:55,483 --> 00:25:57,518
all the time. Hello.

393
00:25:57,518 --> 00:26:00,029
SAM: I would go with Jarett, because he's so
dreamy and hunky.

394
00:26:00,029 --> 00:26:02,034
LAURA: He is so dreamy.

395
00:26:02,034 --> 00:26:03,529
SAM: (Jarett voice) Hello.

396
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:09,125
LIAM: The one that got away? I'd go Clarota.

397
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:13,609
(cheering)

398
00:26:13,609 --> 00:26:19,077
MARISHA: Can I be Matt's illusory beholder from
the last episode?

399
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:24,299
(laughter)

400
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:29,169
MARISHA: Kitten's worth of hit points.

401
00:26:29,169 --> 00:26:33,222
LIAM: (illusory beholder voice) Hah! I used to do
Broadway!

402
00:26:33,222 --> 00:26:36,407
(laughter)

403
00:26:36,407 --> 00:26:42,830
MARISHA: Next question.

404
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:45,766
BRIAN: All right, that's good, thank you. What's
your name?

405
00:26:45,766 --> 00:26:46,895
JUSTIN: Justin.

406
00:26:46,895 --> 00:26:47,978
ALL: Hi, Justin.

407
00:26:47,978 --> 00:26:54,724
JUSTIN: Hi. So my home D&amp;D group also happens to
include a lot of stage and improv actors from the

408
00:26:54,724 --> 00:27:00,545
Boston area, and so I take a lot of inspiration
from what you guys do, and I'm wondering, for any

409
00:27:00,545 --> 00:27:07,944
of you, the whole approach or the headspace you're
in to do Critical Role, does it have any

410
00:27:07,944 --> 00:27:14,714
relationship to what you would do or how you would
approach a stage role or an improv, scripted role?

411
00:27:14,714 --> 00:27:17,346
Is there a relation, or is it totally different?

412
00:27:17,346 --> 00:27:23,978
LIAM: Oh, yeah. Some of us were talking in the
green room before coming out here right before the

413
00:27:23,978 --> 00:27:29,627
show started. I spent years in the theater, and
it's been ten years since my last one, and three

414
00:27:29,627 --> 00:27:33,786
years ago, I was like, "Man, I'm getting really
itchy, I've got to get back on stage." And that's

415
00:27:33,786 --> 00:27:42,426
gone. This scratches that itch so much. And we're
living in a role for five years? Is it five

416
00:27:42,426 --> 00:27:43,561
years?

417
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:47,761
MARISHA: Yeah, in a weird way, it feels like the
longest longform improv.

418
00:27:47,761 --> 00:27:58,276
LAURA: I feel like the preparation for it can be
very similar. I feel like we slid our way into our

419
00:27:58,276 --> 00:28:02,826
backstories and everything like that. We had loose
ideas of what it was before we started playing a

420
00:28:02,826 --> 00:28:10,082
lot, but when you're starting a new role in a
theater show-- what am I talking about? Then yeah,

421
00:28:10,082 --> 00:28:14,787
you would do the same thing, you would establish
all of those ties in your mind, and you would

422
00:28:14,787 --> 00:28:19,981
figure out what is their favorite music to listen
to, and what kind of food do they like, and all

423
00:28:19,981 --> 00:28:22,535
that kind of stuff, and it's the same stuff you do
with this.

424
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:25,642
MARISHA: Yeah, part of the reason we did the
playlists is because we were all already doing

425
00:28:25,642 --> 00:28:31,360
them. And then we thought, awesome, we'll publish
them out. And the playlists-- I think it's

426
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,495
actually a good tip for people trying to find
their character who might be new to it, is build a

427
00:28:36,495 --> 00:28:41,495
playlist for your character. It informs a lot, and
it gets you in the mood right before you go.

428
00:28:41,495 --> 00:28:43,803
(laughter)

429
00:28:43,803 --> 00:28:47,061
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's good for the drive over, you
really get the headspace.

430
00:28:47,061 --> 00:28:49,391
BRIAN: Let the bodies hit the lava. Is that on
your playlist?

431
00:28:49,391 --> 00:28:50,655
MARISHA: Yeah.

432
00:28:50,655 --> 00:28:55,972
TRAVIS: Those are actually all on my playlist.
These are the songs.

433
00:28:55,972 --> 00:28:58,100
(laughter)

434
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,551
TRAVIS: Just rage and death and destruction.

435
00:29:00,551 --> 00:29:03,385
LAURA: What is it, C is for Cookie? That was one
year?

436
00:29:03,385 --> 00:29:05,691
MARISHA: Yes, cute!

437
00:29:05,691 --> 00:29:08,005
TRAVIS: Always learning.

438
00:29:08,005 --> 00:29:10,330
(laughter)

439
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:12,522
MATT: Awesome, thank you so much.

440
00:29:12,522 --> 00:29:15,072
BRIAN: Thank you very much. Hey, what's your
name?

441
00:29:15,072 --> 00:29:21,421
DAVID: Hi, I'm David, hi, hello. My question is
for world-famous podcasters Sam Riegel and Liam

442
00:29:21,421 --> 00:29:22,459
O'Brien.

443
00:29:22,459 --> 00:29:23,793
SAM: Sure, yeah.

444
00:29:23,793 --> 00:29:27,707
DAVID: Can we expect another episode of All Work
No Play within the next three years?

445
00:29:27,707 --> 00:29:33,082
TRAVIS: Yeah, can we?! Please?! I want it!

446
00:29:33,082 --> 00:29:34,777
BRIAN: Three years, you can make that happen.

447
00:29:34,777 --> 00:29:36,735
LIAM: Let's get married all over again.

448
00:29:36,735 --> 00:29:45,534
SAM: The marriage episode? Yeah. Yeah, for sure.
For sure. We do a couple podcast episodes a year.

449
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:48,577
We're averaging about two a year these days.

450
00:29:48,577 --> 00:29:52,168
LIAM: I mean, we talk about doing it like 12 times
a year. So that's got to count for something.

451
00:29:52,168 --> 00:29:59,101
SAM: Here's the status: we wanted to pitch our
podcast to Geek and Sundry to do on a regular

452
00:29:59,101 --> 00:30:03,236
basis, but we can't even find a time to go pitch
it.

453
00:30:03,236 --> 00:30:05,346
(laughter)

454
00:30:05,346 --> 00:30:09,016
MARISHA: That's not true. I told you a bajillion
times we would just do it.

455
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:10,323
SAM: Oh, yeah?

456
00:30:10,323 --> 00:30:14,548
MARISHA: I've told you a bajillion times we would
do it.

457
00:30:14,548 --> 00:30:17,369
SAM: You won't even invite me on Signal Boost.

458
00:30:17,369 --> 00:30:21,918
BRIAN: Oh, that is-- there is video evidence that
that's bullshit.

459
00:30:21,918 --> 00:30:23,761
MARISHA: Gaslighter!

460
00:30:23,761 --> 00:30:26,848
LIAM: Sam Riegel will be dead in under an hour.

461
00:30:26,848 --> 00:30:35,705
SAM: No more All Work No Play. Yeah, we have one
planned, because we're going to do a live episode

462
00:30:35,705 --> 00:30:42,495
soon, in a couple weeks, and then maybe we'll do
it where we're going to go into somebody's hot tub

463
00:30:42,495 --> 00:30:43,577
to record an episode.

464
00:30:43,577 --> 00:30:45,448
LIAM: Yeah, we've been threatening to return to
the hot tub.

465
00:30:45,448 --> 00:30:46,654
SAM: Oh, do you have a hot tub?

466
00:30:46,654 --> 00:30:47,505
LAURA: We have a hot tub.

467
00:30:47,505 --> 00:30:49,036
SAM: Well, you were already a guest on the show.

468
00:30:49,036 --> 00:30:50,078
LAURA: So?

469
00:30:50,078 --> 00:30:52,097
SAM: Okay, can we go in your hot tub and bring a
stranger to interview?

470
00:30:52,097 --> 00:30:53,885
(laughter)

471
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:57,006
LAURA: Sure.

472
00:30:57,006 --> 00:30:58,741
(laughter)

473
00:30:58,741 --> 00:31:00,554
SAM: You can hold the boom mic.

474
00:31:00,554 --> 00:31:02,581
(laughter)

475
00:31:02,581 --> 00:31:04,865
SAM: Thanks for the question.

476
00:31:04,865 --> 00:31:08,641
BRIAN: What's your name?

477
00:31:08,641 --> 00:31:10,756
ALL: Hi.

478
00:31:10,756 --> 00:31:16,337
GABBY: Hello. So I'm Gabby. Real quick, thank you,
because last year at Comic Con, when I asked you a

479
00:31:16,337 --> 00:31:20,653
question saying I couldn't find a group, I
immediately found my current Dungeon Master, and

480
00:31:20,653 --> 00:31:24,511
we play on roll20 whenever we can. So thank you
for that.

481
00:31:24,511 --> 00:31:26,741
(cheering)

482
00:31:26,741 --> 00:31:34,198
GABBY: And my question is, due to everything that
has been going on with your characters, everything

483
00:31:34,198 --> 00:31:38,560
that's been going on, I was wondering what your
characters are grateful for?

484
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:45,563
MATT: What are your characters grateful for?

485
00:31:45,563 --> 00:31:59,347
TRAVIS: (Grog voice) I'm grateful for, um. Ale.
And my buddy Pike. And my friends. Also, ale.

486
00:31:59,347 --> 00:32:11,206
MARISHA: Currently--

487
00:32:11,206 --> 00:32:12,960
LIAM: Yeah, Kiki.

488
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,414
LAURA: Just tears.

489
00:32:14,414 --> 00:32:19,126
MARISHA: Keyleth is-- she hasn't said it out loud
in-game yet, but she will, but she's thankful for

490
00:32:19,126 --> 00:32:22,254
being taught how to love by a certain rogue.

491
00:32:22,254 --> 00:32:24,698
ALL: Aww.

492
00:32:24,698 --> 00:32:26,461
SAM: Well, I wouldn't call myself a rogue.

493
00:32:26,461 --> 00:32:33,664
(laughter)

494
00:32:33,664 --> 00:32:46,416
TALIESIN: Definitely grateful for family at the
moment, is Percy's bag right now. He's feeling

495
00:32:46,416 --> 00:32:48,782
good, all things considered.

496
00:32:48,782 --> 00:32:56,242
ASHLEY: Yeah, family. The friendship that we
all... have.

497
00:32:56,242 --> 00:32:58,937
(laughter)

498
00:32:58,937 --> 00:33:00,573
SAM: Your family's weird, though.

499
00:33:00,573 --> 00:33:08,071
ASHLEY: I know! That's why I appreciate the
friends that you've made into your family, because

500
00:33:08,071 --> 00:33:16,867
the Trickfoots, as we know, are so terrible. And
also, I think being able to see Sarenrae, the

501
00:33:16,867 --> 00:33:22,977
Everlight, in person, I think that's opened up
something else in Pike, and what else?

502
00:33:22,977 --> 00:33:24,780
BRIAN: Technically via Skype.

503
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:27,000
ASHLEY: Via Skype, but still.

504
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:36,008
SAM: I think Scanlan values being accepted back
into the group. That's about it. And Kaylie.

505
00:33:36,008 --> 00:33:40,968
LIAM: I mean, I've got to go with the boots,
right? I've got to go with the boots. I got my

506
00:33:40,968 --> 00:33:44,131
boots back. Our long national nightmare is finally
over.

507
00:33:44,131 --> 00:33:45,535
BRIAN: Oh, boy.

508
00:33:45,535 --> 00:33:50,542
LAURA: I was never going to keep them! Until he's
dead, and then they're mine.

509
00:33:50,542 --> 00:33:56,711
LIAM: All of us are grateful for family, he's
obviously grateful for his twin, he's grateful for

510
00:33:56,711 --> 00:33:59,274
love. You know, life is short.

511
00:33:59,274 --> 00:34:04,031
SAM: We're all dying every day.

512
00:34:04,031 --> 00:34:06,280
LIAM: But mainly the boots.

513
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:15,335
LAURA: Grateful for Percy and for Whitestone and
for having a place she can call home. I know. And

514
00:34:15,335 --> 00:34:18,001
for, you know--

515
00:34:18,001 --> 00:34:20,862
SAM: I'm 'gramming it.

516
00:34:20,862 --> 00:34:30,202
LAURA: For Vax being back. And even for, you know,
she's grateful for the time that they have. Yeah,

517
00:34:30,202 --> 00:34:31,721
yeah, yeah.

518
00:34:31,721 --> 00:34:37,315
MATT: I can't answer in 500 voices at once.

519
00:34:37,315 --> 00:34:40,603
BRIAN: Well, that's why we're here. Do it.

520
00:34:40,603 --> 00:34:46,071
MATT: It'd be very Lovecraftian if I did that all
of a sudden, you heard 500 voices come out. All of

521
00:34:46,071 --> 00:34:48,134
your minds shatter together as one.

522
00:34:48,134 --> 00:34:56,054
BRIAN: No one would be surprised. All right, all
right. Who's next? Thank you, that was a great

523
00:34:56,054 --> 00:34:57,406
question.

524
00:34:57,406 --> 00:34:59,226
TRAVIS and BRIAN: I like your ears.

525
00:34:59,226 --> 00:35:02,189
BRIAN: Travis likes them, too. Hey, what's your
name?

526
00:35:02,189 --> 00:35:07,499
TREVOR: My name's Trevor. First, I want to thank
you all for the hours of entertainment and the

527
00:35:07,499 --> 00:35:14,804
inspiration. You guys are awesome. My question is,
the playlists are awesome. Will we ever see guest

528
00:35:14,804 --> 00:35:16,031
playlists?

529
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:21,750
MARISHA: Ooh. Hey, y'all want to do some guest
playlists? Yeah, sure.

530
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:23,832
BRIAN: Okay, we got some thumbs up, all right.

531
00:35:23,832 --> 00:35:25,646
TALIESIN: Legitimately hadn't thought of that.

532
00:35:25,646 --> 00:35:27,948
LIAM: Tova slow-jazz.

533
00:35:27,948 --> 00:35:32,183
TALIESIN: There is a song, I Want a New Duck.

534
00:35:32,183 --> 00:35:35,081
NOELLE: (offscreen) --something by "Bear" Naked
Ladies.

535
00:35:35,081 --> 00:35:40,525
SAM: "Bear"naked Ladies. Nice. (sings) It's
been--

536
00:35:40,525 --> 00:35:44,935
LAURA: Oh, no. I see who this is.

537
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:49,304
BRIAN: Oh, hey, what's up? What's up? Oh, shit!

538
00:35:49,304 --> 00:35:51,749
(laughter)

539
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:53,303
SAM: He just ran 480 feet.

540
00:35:53,303 --> 00:35:56,480
LAURA: He was gone so fast!

541
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,229
BRIAN: Turns out you can go that many feet that
fast.

542
00:36:00,229 --> 00:36:02,905
SAM: He ran 480 feet and threw four daggers.

543
00:36:02,905 --> 00:36:05,846
(laughter)

544
00:36:05,846 --> 00:36:09,689
SAM: Okay, what you got?

545
00:36:09,689 --> 00:36:11,872
LAURA: What you got for us, Ray?

546
00:36:11,872 --> 00:36:14,866
KRISTINA: Hi. So my name's Kristina.

547
00:36:14,866 --> 00:36:16,071
MATT: Hi, Kristina.

548
00:36:16,071 --> 00:36:20,217
KRISTINA: So you're currently dealing with an arc
of gods and those ascending to godhood. Say

549
00:36:20,217 --> 00:36:24,542
somehow that happens to your Vox Machina
characters. What would they be the guardians of

550
00:36:24,542 --> 00:36:26,873
the domains of, essentially? What would they be
the gods of?

551
00:36:26,873 --> 00:36:28,158
TRAVIS: (cackles)

552
00:36:28,158 --> 00:36:32,140
(laughter)

553
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,643
TRAVIS: Carnal pleasure.

554
00:36:33,643 --> 00:36:38,304
(laughter)

555
00:36:38,304 --> 00:36:44,908
TRAVIS: And all will worship me! So great.

556
00:36:44,908 --> 00:36:50,985
MARISHA: I want to see Bacchus Grog now, only
wearing a grape leaf.

557
00:36:50,985 --> 00:36:57,051
BRIAN: That evil laugh you heard is what happens
when Travis gets a softball question.

558
00:36:57,051 --> 00:37:00,324
(laughter)

559
00:37:00,324 --> 00:37:09,331
MARISHA: I mean, I'm Voice of the Tempest, so
probably some weather.

560
00:37:09,331 --> 00:37:11,891
(laughter)

561
00:37:11,891 --> 00:37:13,513
TALIESIN: Curse your name every time it rains.

562
00:37:13,513 --> 00:37:22,029
MARISHA: Basically turn into Storm. Everyone's
least favorite X-Man. No, that's arranged for

563
00:37:22,029 --> 00:37:24,406
Dazzler, probably, right?

564
00:37:24,406 --> 00:37:32,904
TALIESIN: You wound me. No, I think he would
definitely-- there's a history of machinist gods,

565
00:37:32,904 --> 00:37:38,297
the gods of order and making things happen the way
they're supposed to, so he would definitely go

566
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:39,734
that direction.

567
00:37:39,734 --> 00:37:43,504
ASHLEY: (unenthused) I mean, Pike would probably
be the god of love and kindness and feelings.

568
00:37:43,504 --> 00:37:46,456
(laughter)

569
00:37:46,456 --> 00:37:49,541
ASHLEY: Blah-blah-blah.

570
00:37:49,541 --> 00:37:58,594
SAM: If there's a god of aerated wine, then I'd be
that. God of grapes and aerated wine.

571
00:37:58,594 --> 00:38:01,204
LIAM: The temple's full of upside-down fountains.

572
00:38:01,204 --> 00:38:04,826
(laughter)

573
00:38:04,826 --> 00:38:06,994
LIAM: I'm gunning for your job, girl.

574
00:38:06,994 --> 00:38:09,420
LAURA: What, you'd be the raven--

575
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,204
MATT: Oh, it's on now.

576
00:38:11,204 --> 00:38:12,851
ASHLEY: Duke it out, right now.

577
00:38:12,851 --> 00:38:14,671
LAURA: Right now! Arm wrestle.

578
00:38:14,671 --> 00:38:16,472
LIAM: After the panel.

579
00:38:16,472 --> 00:38:21,796
LAURA: I don't know. The goddess of commerce,
or--

580
00:38:21,796 --> 00:38:24,096
(laughter)

581
00:38:24,096 --> 00:38:25,306
TRAVIS: Commerce?

582
00:38:25,306 --> 00:38:26,550
LAURA: All things sparkly?

583
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:34,611
BRIAN: The god of commerce? Sounds badass. I
wouldn't mess with the god of commerce.

584
00:38:34,611 --> 00:38:38,232
SAM: The small business association god?

585
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:45,933
LAURA: Pretty much. Her temple would be where you
drop off your gold at, you know what I mean?

586
00:38:45,933 --> 00:38:48,751
BRIAN: She'd cut you with a deposit slip.

587
00:38:48,751 --> 00:38:54,642
MATT: The god of naps and free time.

588
00:38:54,642 --> 00:39:00,305
BRIAN: Amen. Great question. Great outfit.

589
00:39:00,305 --> 00:39:02,588
LIAM: We do deal in fantasy, Matt.

590
00:39:02,588 --> 00:39:05,627
BRIAN: Hey, what's your name? Nice shirt!

591
00:39:05,627 --> 00:39:10,431
MICHAEL: Thank you. My name's Michael, I saw you
at the Magic Castle.

592
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:13,169
MATT: Good to see you again.

593
00:39:13,169 --> 00:39:19,508
MICHAEL: So my question is, I know you have a live
show coming up at Gen Con. I was wondering if you

594
00:39:19,508 --> 00:39:22,262
guys have any plans to do a live show on the West
Coast?

595
00:39:22,262 --> 00:39:28,481
(cheering)

596
00:39:28,481 --> 00:39:30,757
SAM: Big reveal. No.

597
00:39:30,757 --> 00:39:34,341
(laughter)

598
00:39:34,341 --> 00:39:37,440
LAURA: That's a good question, though.

599
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,191
MATT: We're, you know, shows are a big
undertaking, and trying to get the logistics

600
00:39:42,191 --> 00:39:47,702
worked out are always difficult, both within
locations and scheduling everything. We'd

601
00:39:47,702 --> 00:39:53,729
definitely like to do more live shows, so if we
manage to put something together for that in the

602
00:39:53,729 --> 00:39:57,436
future, we will be happy to announce it and
eagerly throw it in your face.

603
00:39:57,436 --> 00:40:07,951
SAM: I've pushed for us to rent ourselves out,
like for bar mitzvahs and quinceaneras and stuff.

604
00:40:07,951 --> 00:40:17,041
I feel like we could go, play a short game, and
then Hava Nagila. I don't know. Something.

605
00:40:17,041 --> 00:40:20,842
LIAM: Life is short, kids. Happy Sweet 16.

606
00:40:20,842 --> 00:40:29,307
BRIAN: Yeah, we'll keep you posted. We'll keep you
posted. By the way, Gil the Blogsmith over here,

607
00:40:29,307 --> 00:40:33,079
ladies and gentlemen, in the green. Stand up, Gil,
let people give you some love.

608
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:34,780
TRAVIS: Stand up, Gil, Jesus!

609
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:42,040
BRIAN: Stand up, for god's sake! There we go. Look
at that beautiful, beautiful man. Okay, who's up

610
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,053
next?

611
00:40:43,053 --> 00:40:44,653
SAM: There's more reveals, Brian.

612
00:40:44,653 --> 00:40:49,067
BRIAN: Oh, there are. Hold on one sec, we have
another big-- we'll leak a couple more out as we

613
00:40:49,067 --> 00:40:50,386
go here.

614
00:40:50,386 --> 00:40:55,493
SAM: Pike's next storyline involves her covered in
tattoos and the rest of the team deciphering their

615
00:40:55,493 --> 00:40:56,567
meaning.

616
00:40:56,567 --> 00:40:59,323
(laughter)

617
00:40:59,323 --> 00:41:06,318
ASHLEY: (grunts)

618
00:41:06,318 --> 00:41:09,777
(laughter)

619
00:41:09,777 --> 00:41:14,191
BRIAN: Laura has also decided to give away all of
her possessions and only own dice.

620
00:41:14,191 --> 00:41:17,633
LAURA: I could probably build a house from them,
so. It's fine.

621
00:41:17,633 --> 00:41:19,108
BRIAN: Okay, who's next?

622
00:41:19,108 --> 00:41:26,089
VAUGHAN: Hi, my name is Vaughan. This question is
for Matt, but I'd like the rest to answer,

623
00:41:26,089 --> 00:41:28,258
including Brian "Cabbage" Foster.

624
00:41:28,258 --> 00:41:32,894
BRIAN: That's a good one. Format it however you
want.

625
00:41:32,894 --> 00:41:38,317
VAUGHAN: What is your favorite 16-bit JRPG?

626
00:41:38,317 --> 00:41:40,452
MATT: Ooh.

627
00:41:40,452 --> 00:41:43,499
TRAVIS: 16-bit?

628
00:41:43,499 --> 00:41:48,033
MATT: That's a neck-and-neck battle between Final
Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger.

629
00:41:48,033 --> 00:41:50,692
(cheering)

630
00:41:50,692 --> 00:41:56,684
MATT: With, like, a little bit of Earthbound
creeping up there. But I'm probably going to have

631
00:41:56,684 --> 00:42:08,067
to say Final Fantasy VI to me. But it's a tough
one. Just barely because the story goes a little

632
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:13,210
bit darker and intense in the third act. Not that
Lobos wasn't intense.

633
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:15,011
LAURA: It has to be 16-bit?

634
00:42:15,011 --> 00:42:20,925
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think you're forgetting about the
amazing 16-bit JRPG Jurassic Park. I love that

635
00:42:20,925 --> 00:42:23,182
one, on the Gameboy?

636
00:42:23,182 --> 00:42:28,126
MARISHA: The ones in arcades where you got in it?
That was a great game.

637
00:42:28,126 --> 00:42:34,609
LAURA: I was a PC gamer during that time, and so I
was King's Quest and Quest for Glory, so.

638
00:42:34,609 --> 00:42:43,049
LIAM: Yeah, I have a big gap in my gaming history.
I had an Atari, and a Commodore 64, and then

639
00:42:43,049 --> 00:42:48,018
nothing until Playstation, so I skipped the whole
16-bit era. I really liked Dungeons and Dragons:

640
00:42:48,018 --> 00:42:53,983
Pool of Radiance on my Commodore 64. Yeah.
Bloop-bloop-bloop.

641
00:42:53,983 --> 00:42:55,538
TALIESIN: Pass?

642
00:42:55,538 --> 00:42:56,797
SAM: Pass.

643
00:42:56,797 --> 00:43:05,024
TALIESIN: I was a Phantasy Star 2 kid. That was
really my jam. That was a weird, weird game, and

644
00:43:05,024 --> 00:43:06,908
the sci-fi vibe was--

645
00:43:06,908 --> 00:43:10,365
MARISHA: Was Secret of Mana 16-bit, or was that
8-bit?

646
00:43:10,365 --> 00:43:12,010
MATT: Yeah, it was 16-bit.

647
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:20,491
MARISHA: Secret of Mana. I loved that game. Yeah.
Light applause, light applause.

648
00:43:20,491 --> 00:43:29,579
BRIAN: Travis? Oh. Terranigma? Or Evo? Anybody
play Evo? Search for Evolve? Search to Evolve?

649
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:32,697
Search of Evolve?

650
00:43:32,697 --> 00:43:37,263
LAURA: (sings) Thank you for your question.

651
00:43:37,263 --> 00:43:40,035
MATT: You got a Laura song.

652
00:43:40,035 --> 00:43:42,150
MARISHA: Manleth!

653
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:44,476
(cheering)

654
00:43:44,476 --> 00:43:46,100
BRIAN: What's your real name?

655
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:47,991
MILES: Hi, my name is Miles.

656
00:43:47,991 --> 00:43:49,977
LIAM: I am intrigued.

657
00:43:49,977 --> 00:44:01,086
(laughter)

658
00:44:01,086 --> 00:44:07,661
MILES: So my question was for the entire panel.
Critical Role has kind of inspired the other RPG

659
00:44:07,661 --> 00:44:14,967
shows on the Geek &amp; Sundry format, so I was
wondering how Vox Machina would react if they were

660
00:44:14,967 --> 00:44:20,218
to plane shift to Vulcana, for instance. From
Titansgrave.

661
00:44:20,218 --> 00:44:23,132
LAURA: Well.

662
00:44:23,132 --> 00:44:26,924
TRAVIS: Electricity would be really interesting.

663
00:44:26,924 --> 00:44:32,322
MARISHA: I think Keyleth would be like, "I knew
it!"

664
00:44:32,322 --> 00:44:39,494
TALIESIN: I'm so delighted by this entire notion
that I can't think straight. Oh my god, D&amp;D

665
00:44:39,494 --> 00:44:41,280
crossovers, what a crazy idea.

666
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,350
MARISHA: Can we jump into Shield of Tomorrow and
do a Star Trek crossover?

667
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:46,789
TALIESIN: I would love to do a Star Trek
crossover. I've got to admit.

668
00:44:46,789 --> 00:44:48,434
MARISHA: I'm into that.

669
00:44:48,434 --> 00:44:51,732
MATT: Oh my god, Vox Machina in Star Trek would be
so horrible.

670
00:44:51,732 --> 00:44:53,791
(laughter)

671
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:57,694
BRIAN: Look at all the Shield of Tomorrow people
going, bring it on.

672
00:44:57,694 --> 00:45:01,913
SAM: Yeah, Scanlan would spend a lot of time in
the holodeck.

673
00:45:01,913 --> 00:45:03,810
(laughter)

674
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:06,109
LIAM: (knocks) What are you doing in there?

675
00:45:06,109 --> 00:45:08,184
SAM: One more minute!

676
00:45:08,184 --> 00:45:12,407
LAURA: I've always wondered about the holodeck in
that way, because--

677
00:45:12,407 --> 00:45:17,086
LIAM: Just because they don't put it in the
episodes doesn't mean it doesn't happen.

678
00:45:17,086 --> 00:45:20,619
LAURA: It has to happen, right? You have an entire
crew of people that are like, (hums).

679
00:45:20,619 --> 00:45:24,450
SAM: That room must be so nasty.

680
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:31,472
LAURA: I know! Maybe they have a secondary
holodeck, you know what I mean?

681
00:45:31,472 --> 00:45:40,098
MATT: I'm not going to Dungeon Master your
holodeck experiences, guys. I'm sorry. I got close

682
00:45:40,098 --> 00:45:44,740
enough with an audiobook once, and that was weird
in its own right.

683
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:47,685
LIAM: I'd like to see Vox Machina skinned into
cyberpunk, I think.

684
00:45:47,685 --> 00:45:50,670
LAURA: That's actually Valkana!

685
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:54,161
LIAM: It's more Blade Runner-y, a little bit.
Whatever.

686
00:45:54,161 --> 00:45:58,318
LAURA: I think they would all get along with
Lemley so well.

687
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:01,010
MATT: That was an awesome question.

688
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:03,517
BRIAN: Thank you so much, Manleth.

689
00:46:03,517 --> 00:46:11,743
MATT: Vax, if you are that intrigued, Alter Self,
she can use at will.

690
00:46:11,743 --> 00:46:13,989
(laughter)

691
00:46:13,989 --> 00:46:16,104
LIAM: I'm aware.

692
00:46:16,104 --> 00:46:18,934
MARISHA: Once again... never mind.

693
00:46:18,934 --> 00:46:25,869
LIAM: Just because Vax has never pooped in an
episode of Critical Role and you haven't seen it,

694
00:46:25,869 --> 00:46:28,205
doesn't mean it doesn't happen.

695
00:46:28,205 --> 00:46:33,104
LAURA: Vex doesn't poop. I'm just putting that out
there. She never poops. Ever.

696
00:46:33,104 --> 00:46:34,892
MATT: #Vaxdoesntpoop.

697
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:37,081
LIAM: Not anymore.

698
00:46:37,081 --> 00:46:41,610
LAURA: Oh! Do you eat?

699
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:43,413
LIAM: I don't know.

700
00:46:43,413 --> 00:46:46,520
LAURA: Oh no! How are you going to have a Heroes'
Feast?

701
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:48,458
LIAM: We'll find out.

702
00:46:48,458 --> 00:46:49,664
MATT: Next question.

703
00:46:49,664 --> 00:46:51,996
BRIAN: Yeah, we've got to move on or we're going
to get spoilery.

704
00:46:51,996 --> 00:46:56,718
AUDIENCE MEMBER: So the rest did enough questions,
so super nerdy inquiry to Matt about old school

705
00:46:56,718 --> 00:47:01,314
D&amp;D. Since you've introduced the current arc and
you start going to the upper planes of the gods,

706
00:47:01,314 --> 00:47:07,970
pretty much all I can think about is the final
AD&amp;D book: Die, Vecna, Die. It's an essential

707
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:14,102
story about him, and I'm wondering-- I've been
going through the campaign book and looking at

708
00:47:14,102 --> 00:47:18,668
your pantheon and so forth, and have you
considered the stuff from those old stories in

709
00:47:18,668 --> 00:47:24,523
regards to the Serpent and Lady of Pain and Sigil
and the stuff above the gods, if you have that

710
00:47:24,523 --> 00:47:28,543
figured out and those cosmology and whether it
will come out either in this campaign or

711
00:47:28,543 --> 00:47:31,690
eventually. I assume they fight Tharizdun in the
next campaign.

712
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:37,625
MATT: Right. I take a lot of inspiration from
elements of that Vecna story, because Vecna's such

713
00:47:37,625 --> 00:47:46,771
an intrinsic villain to D&amp;D lore. To change him
too much would be upsetting to me. And a lot of

714
00:47:46,771 --> 00:47:52,262
you guys, as well. There is a lot of expectation
there. So I want to make him unique to this

715
00:47:52,262 --> 00:47:56,522
campaign in this world, because he's definitely
not the exact same character. There are elements

716
00:47:56,522 --> 00:48:00,971
of that that are classic lore that are pulled into
this that may be revealed in the future.

717
00:48:00,971 --> 00:48:08,006
Especially now that we're releasing campaign
guides and this has become a world now that we can

718
00:48:08,006 --> 00:48:14,577
bring to you guys to play in, I have to be careful
to not pull in too much of the very licensed D&amp;D

719
00:48:14,577 --> 00:48:18,813
lore. Otherwise, we would have to reskin
everything and you all are like, "oh wait, which

720
00:48:18,813 --> 00:48:26,685
"one's which? Oh no." I'm trying to keep that to a
minimum. But if you know a lot about Vecna--

721
00:48:26,685 --> 00:48:28,671
LAURA: Then tell us.

722
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:30,296
MATT: Then don't tell them anything.

723
00:48:30,296 --> 00:48:33,497
LAURA: Tell us his weaknesses.

724
00:48:33,497 --> 00:48:35,202
MATT: Don't listen to her...

725
00:48:35,202 --> 00:48:39,023
LIAM: This is the perfect time to segue into our
next Comic-Con announcement though, which is in

726
00:48:39,023 --> 00:48:41,859
season three, we are converting to first edition
D&amp;D.

727
00:48:41,859 --> 00:48:47,292
MATT: The characters will die before you get
artwork done.

728
00:48:47,292 --> 00:48:53,672
BRIAN: Okay. Next question. Thank you very much.
Hey, what's your name?

729
00:48:53,672 --> 00:48:55,434
SEAN: Hi. My name is Sean.

730
00:48:55,434 --> 00:48:56,901
MATT, MARISHA and LAURA: Hi, Sean!

731
00:48:56,901 --> 00:49:01,974
SEAN: Hi. I actually saw Matt first in front of me
for the ThunderCats panel in this room.

732
00:49:01,974 --> 00:49:04,973
MATT: Yeah! Oh, way back then! Oh man.

733
00:49:04,973 --> 00:49:09,676
SEAN: My question is actually related to that. How
much Critical Role's grown over the years. I'm

734
00:49:09,676 --> 00:49:13,664
sure none of you expected it to grow to this type
of audience, and I still remember the days when

735
00:49:13,664 --> 00:49:18,655
you were reading all the donations, even on
stream. Do any of you miss anything from those

736
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:20,995
early days when it was still such a small show?

737
00:49:20,995 --> 00:49:23,573
LIAM: I liked eating fried chicken on set.

738
00:49:23,573 --> 00:49:26,720
LAURA: That was great.

739
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:36,056
MARISHA: I feel like we can't go through all the
fanart-- we do, but after the after-show reactions

740
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:38,996
and responses, we can't really go through it as
much anymore.

741
00:49:38,996 --> 00:49:44,794
TALIESIN: It was much easier. We're getting to a
point we're like-- whoa.

742
00:49:44,794 --> 00:49:47,159
TRAVIS: Excuse me.

743
00:49:47,159 --> 00:49:52,759
TALIESIN: I miss when the correspondence was more
manageable as opposed to this is something I have

744
00:49:52,759 --> 00:50:00,353
to set aside time every day to do it. But yeah.
That's the one thing I miss. Oh, five minutes a

745
00:50:00,353 --> 00:50:02,501
week. I can deal with this.

746
00:50:02,501 --> 00:50:05,463
BRIAN: Does anyone miss shooting in a
three-year-old child's bedroom?

747
00:50:05,463 --> 00:50:08,073
LAURA: It was pretty. I liked it.

748
00:50:08,073 --> 00:50:09,582
BRIAN: Me, too. I was just wondering.

749
00:50:09,582 --> 00:50:17,564
LIAM: The race car bed was <i>just</i> out of camera. I
mean, I love what we're doing now, but I also

750
00:50:17,564 --> 00:50:21,665
liked-- we were still dumb idiots at the beginning
of the show. We didn't have the weight of the

751
00:50:21,665 --> 00:50:25,002
world on our shoulders, really, so it was nice
being carefree.

752
00:50:25,002 --> 00:50:28,577
MATT: Sorry, what am I supposed to do at level
16?

753
00:50:28,577 --> 00:50:30,442
LIAM: Exactly what you're doing!

754
00:50:30,442 --> 00:50:37,895
MATT: Some clown scared a family! Things get a
little heavy in the later levels, but we'll get

755
00:50:37,895 --> 00:50:40,738
back to the carefree feeling probably in the next
campaign.

756
00:50:40,738 --> 00:50:42,177
LAURA: When we're all dead.

757
00:50:42,177 --> 00:50:43,536
(laughter)

758
00:50:43,536 --> 00:50:45,141
BRIAN: Great question.

759
00:50:45,141 --> 00:50:56,234
MATT: For me, I guess what I miss a little bit is
the anonymity to go into the Dealers' Hall. But

760
00:50:56,234 --> 00:51:01,066
other than that, I wouldn't change anything. This
is amazing. <i>This</i> is amazing.

761
00:51:01,066 --> 00:51:05,663
BRIAN: Put on Ivan's demogorgon outfit and wander
the floor and nobody will know it's you!

762
00:51:05,663 --> 00:51:07,100
LAURA: You could put on a mask.

763
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:11,147
MATT: Well, now I can't do <i>that</i> costume. Thanks,
Brian.

764
00:51:11,147 --> 00:51:18,759
BRIAN: I might have not thought that through all
the way, he said to a microphone. Thank you for

765
00:51:18,759 --> 00:51:22,904
the question, though. You're awesome. You're
great. Hey, what's up? All right, we're going to

766
00:51:22,904 --> 00:51:26,134
have to lightning-round this because we've got
about seven minutes left, so go ahead.

767
00:51:26,134 --> 00:51:32,128
MC: All right. Hi, my name's MC. Really quick.
What has surprised you about all of your guys'

768
00:51:32,128 --> 00:51:37,938
character developments, and I guess for Matt, the
world developments, that have come up over the

769
00:51:37,938 --> 00:51:39,239
past few years?

770
00:51:39,239 --> 00:51:45,212
MATT: For me? Surprised that people want to play
there and everything's been reactionary. Creating

771
00:51:45,212 --> 00:51:48,110
the campaign guide was reactionary. That wasn't
our idea. Green Ronin came to us; they were like,

772
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:54,505
"You want to do a campaign guide?" Okay. So we're
amazed that people have interest in them.

773
00:51:54,505 --> 00:51:58,973
LAURA: Um...

774
00:51:58,973 --> 00:51:59,798
SAM: Skip her!

775
00:51:59,798 --> 00:52:06,893
LAURA: No! Oh, it's lightning round. Shit. Shoot.
No, I'm surprised that she is willing to take

776
00:52:06,893 --> 00:52:12,063
responsibility for more than just herself and her
brother and her bear.

777
00:52:12,063 --> 00:52:20,460
LIAM: Never thought that Vax would get dark as he
has. It ties into the last question. I thought, we

778
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:23,856
were like a couple of Han Solo characters for our
entire home campaign, at the beginning of the

779
00:52:23,856 --> 00:52:30,762
campaign and would never have predicted that it
would be so freaking serious. Ever.

780
00:52:30,762 --> 00:52:39,337
SAM: I was surprised that Taryon lasted longer
than two episodes. And... that's it.

781
00:52:39,337 --> 00:52:44,905
ASHLEY: I think most recently, I'm surprised I
didn't realise Pike would ever be able to have

782
00:52:44,905 --> 00:52:48,672
wings. That's pretty good.

783
00:52:48,672 --> 00:52:53,584
TALIESIN: I was expecting Percy to end a terrible
mess, and it somehow has not happened. He's

784
00:52:53,584 --> 00:52:57,319
actually kind of a functional human being, which
was not the plan, ever.

785
00:52:57,319 --> 00:53:06,320
MARISHA: I think it's that the development's never
over; the world is always affecting the way you

786
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:17,885
go. Keyleth fell from pretty high and got dark.
Literally smeared on broken rocks. That was

787
00:53:17,885 --> 00:53:20,444
shocking. I'll pick that.

788
00:53:20,444 --> 00:53:22,854
LIAM: That was not in your vision.

789
00:53:22,854 --> 00:53:24,951
MARISHA: No!

790
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:27,758
LIAM: This one's for Keyleth! (thuds)

791
00:53:27,758 --> 00:53:32,048
TRAVIS: I was surprised Grog became the smartest
member of the group.

792
00:53:32,048 --> 00:53:36,952
(cheering)

793
00:53:36,952 --> 00:53:38,306
TRAVIS: That happened, right?

794
00:53:38,306 --> 00:53:40,531
BRIAN: Thank you. Who's up next?

795
00:53:40,531 --> 00:53:48,219
MIKELYN: Hi guys! My name is Mikelyn. I was
wondering, Matt, what scenario were you most proud

796
00:53:48,219 --> 00:53:52,912
of throwing at the group, or what is your favorite
kind of scenario to throw at them?

797
00:53:52,912 --> 00:54:00,793
MATT: Timed scenarios. D&amp;D is a lot of planning
and arguing and trying to figure things out, and

798
00:54:00,793 --> 00:54:06,746
there's game time versus planning time, and I love
a scenario where I can tell the players, "well,

799
00:54:06,746 --> 00:54:15,121
"you have this much time to do both. Go." It ups
the intensity, so I love me my hourglasses,

800
00:54:15,121 --> 00:54:16,356
definitely.

801
00:54:16,356 --> 00:54:17,964
LIAM: Stupid rakshasa.

802
00:54:17,964 --> 00:54:19,906
MIKELYN: Thank you.

803
00:54:19,906 --> 00:54:21,394
MATT: Thank you!

804
00:54:21,394 --> 00:54:23,118
BRIAN: Next question. What's your name?

805
00:54:23,118 --> 00:54:30,039
ALEX: Hi, I'm Alex. Thank you Ashley for Gortys,
because she's the most adorable character ever.

806
00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:31,846
LAURA: She's pretty great.

807
00:54:31,846 --> 00:54:37,215
ALEX: Thank you Laura for Lucina, because she is
the best. And Matt, what time is it?

808
00:54:37,215 --> 00:54:43,017
MARISHA: Man! Almost got through a panel.

809
00:54:43,017 --> 00:54:48,715
MATT: (McCree voice) It's about 34 minutes till
it's high noon.

810
00:54:48,715 --> 00:54:51,060
(cheering)

811
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:52,871
ALEX: Thank you.

812
00:54:52,871 --> 00:54:57,783
LIAM: Panels, Mexican restaurants, the dentist's
office...

813
00:54:57,783 --> 00:54:58,990
BRIAN: Anywhere.

814
00:54:58,990 --> 00:55:02,461
MATT: I am so conscious of what time it is at
all times now.

815
00:55:02,461 --> 00:55:06,334
(laughter)

816
00:55:06,334 --> 00:55:09,165
BRIAN: All right. Go ahead, man. What's your
name?

817
00:55:09,165 --> 00:55:14,001
ALEX: My name is Alex. Really quickly, couple
years ago, I attended my first panel with you

818
00:55:14,001 --> 00:55:19,622
guys. I had no direction; now I'm auditioning for
things, all because of the advice and inspiration

819
00:55:19,622 --> 00:55:20,875
you guys have given.

820
00:55:20,875 --> 00:55:24,232
(applause)

821
00:55:24,232 --> 00:55:30,702
ALEX: As a fellow DM, Matt, if you're able to tell
us, for the next campaign, it's going to be

822
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:34,016
chronologically after this current timeline or is
it going to be before?

823
00:55:34,016 --> 00:55:40,086
MATT: Yeah, I've mentioned a little bit, I think.
But the next campaign I'm planning to be

824
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:49,434
roughly 20 or so years beyond the end of this
campaign. And it's going to be in a different

825
00:55:49,434 --> 00:55:56,348
continent, and there's a possibility, depending on
which characters and NPCs survive this final arc,

826
00:55:56,348 --> 00:55:58,821
they'll be existing somewhere in the world.

827
00:55:58,821 --> 00:56:00,526
ASHLEY: What?!

828
00:56:00,526 --> 00:56:17,220
LAURA: So we could visit ourselves if we live?!
(yells) Oh man! That's so cool!

829
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:19,013
SAM: Reveal!

830
00:56:19,013 --> 00:56:24,619
LIAM: I remember your great-great-grandfather,
Trunket. Oh.

831
00:56:24,619 --> 00:56:31,011
LAURA: Oh! Trinket babies! Oh no, Tova, you have
to come back!

832
00:56:31,011 --> 00:56:34,905
(laughter)

833
00:56:34,905 --> 00:56:43,264
BRIAN: Oh my god. What a sentence!

834
00:56:43,264 --> 00:56:44,722
MATT: Next question.

835
00:56:44,722 --> 00:56:47,662
BRIAN: Okay, we've got time for one more. It's up
to you.

836
00:56:47,662 --> 00:56:50,873
AUDIENCE MEMBER: One more? So for all the couples
on the stage, how do you guys deal with each other

837
00:56:50,873 --> 00:56:58,009
<i>after</i> the game? You guys have the car rides
home. How do you deal with some of those more

838
00:56:58,009 --> 00:57:02,754
intense moments that somebody gets something;
Matt, you may have killed a character or whatever.

839
00:57:02,754 --> 00:57:08,469
I can't get through a game of Monopoly with my
wife without going to bed angry. How do you guys

840
00:57:08,469 --> 00:57:09,881
deal with it?

841
00:57:09,881 --> 00:57:12,975
MARISHA: I push him out the window at the Taco
Bell.

842
00:57:12,975 --> 00:57:19,851
MATT: Yeah. Seriously, calm down Taco Bells,
definitely after an intense session. Like driving,

843
00:57:19,851 --> 00:57:24,364
scratch the knee. You want Taco Bell? (mopey
voice) Yes. Okay.

844
00:57:24,364 --> 00:57:32,118
TRAVIS: That's insane because we live ten, 15
minutes from you guys and we do the same shit.

845
00:57:32,118 --> 00:57:34,117
MARISHA: Yeah!

846
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:40,244
TRAVIS: We have our own Taco Bell. I'm like, "why
did you take my Deck of Many Things, Laura?!"

847
00:57:40,244 --> 00:57:49,912
MARISHA: I feel like for us, at the end of the
game, for Matt, he's like, (sighs) "Done for the

848
00:57:49,912 --> 00:57:53,695
"week!" And I'm just getting revved up.

849
00:57:53,695 --> 00:57:59,184
MATT: Why did you ever get the thought it was me
going, "Oh. Done for the week." It's me going,

850
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:04,006
"I'm sorry. It's what the story did."

851
00:58:04,006 --> 00:58:09,349
MARISHA: I'm just saying, your stress seems to
happen before the game and mine happens after. So

852
00:58:09,349 --> 00:58:15,220
the whole time, I'm like, "I mean, I don't know.
What's the Raven Queen's deal? Is she to be

853
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:17,427
"trusted? I don't know." And he's like--

854
00:58:17,427 --> 00:58:18,808
TRAVIS: You don't know.

855
00:58:18,808 --> 00:58:21,297
MARISHA: I'm just talking to a brick wall.

856
00:58:21,297 --> 00:58:26,468
MATT: You want to talk about people that prod,
though; Travis, every given moment turns to me and

857
00:58:26,468 --> 00:58:32,723
goes, "So what's this item do?" You don't know.
And he'll go, "Ugh!"

858
00:58:32,723 --> 00:58:35,974
TRAVIS: He's going to fold one of these times.

859
00:58:35,974 --> 00:58:44,105
BRIAN: Oh wow. Okay, we got to end there, guys.
I'm so sorry. Thank you for your questions. Thank

860
00:58:44,105 --> 00:58:48,336
you guys for waiting. Thank you for lining up and
asking questions. We've got to run. I would like

861
00:58:48,336 --> 00:58:51,220
to thank my guests: a bunch of nerdy-ass voice
actors!

862
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:55,230
(cheering)
