00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,425
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:04,425 --> 00:00:10,402
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around, roll dice, and
play Dungeons and Dragons. You may notice Ashley

3
00:00:10,402 --> 00:00:15,591
Johnson left us last week to go shoot in New York
and shooting got delayed a week.

4
00:00:15,591 --> 00:00:20,339
ASHLEY: Here I am! Well, hey, guys!

5
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:22,284
LAURA: Astral projection!

6
00:00:22,284 --> 00:00:26,699
MATT: Pike's gone, but she at least can sit there
while you guys play, which will be fun.

7
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,067
(laughter)

8
00:00:28,067 --> 00:00:29,683
ASHLEY: I just came to hang out.

9
00:00:29,683 --> 00:00:32,319
MATT: Yeah, that's cool, I appreciate and respect
that. Thank you guys for your patience with the

10
00:00:32,319 --> 00:00:35,688
tech issues, we're trying out some new
arrangements here and it took a little setup.

11
00:00:35,688 --> 00:00:38,188
Nevertheless, we are good to go.

12
00:00:38,188 --> 00:00:44,102
Before we jump into tonight's game, let's go ahead
and get through our announcements. First and

13
00:00:44,102 --> 00:00:49,167
foremost, Loot Crate has been our fantastic
sponsor, and they currently are unveiling their

14
00:00:49,167 --> 00:00:55,126
July theme: Futuristic! Which is pretty rad. They
have a bunch of things from Rick and Morty,

15
00:00:55,126 --> 00:01:00,942
Futurama, Megaman, Valiant Comics, and Star Trek.
Then they have a figure in there, they also have

16
00:01:00,942 --> 00:01:06,524
their monthly t-shirt and pin, all that cool stuff
coming up, and we have the Loot Anime July theme

17
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:13,725
of Squadron as well! Which includes a bunch of
Gundam, Gate, Arpeggio Blue Steel, Anti-Magic

18
00:01:13,725 --> 00:01:18,887
Academy stuff, an exclusive loot to the anime box.
Both of these are their current themes for July.

22
00:01:40,982 --> 00:01:42,479
ASHLEY: It's the best.

23
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,021
LAURA: Do we get to do this? We haven't opened
any of these yet.

24
00:01:46,021 --> 00:01:49,399
SAM: Loot Anime? Wait, we all have to have anime
reactions to these.

25
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:50,920
MATT: Okay, ready. Ready?

26
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,173
TRAVIS: One, two, three.

27
00:01:52,173 --> 00:01:58,129
(anime reactions)

28
00:01:58,129 --> 00:02:00,654
LAURA: Oh, this is super cool!

29
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:09,584
SAM: This is definitely a Captain America shirt.

30
00:02:09,584 --> 00:02:11,694
MATT: I was going to say Homestar Runner.

31
00:02:11,694 --> 00:02:14,256
(laughter)

32
00:02:14,256 --> 00:02:16,629
TRAVIS: Biggest Dragon Ball Z fan in the world.

33
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:26,780
MARISHA: It's Super Saiyan Goku! That's pretty
great! He's got gold hair.

34
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:32,088
TALIESIN: Boy and little Chiko! I'm going to put it
on my head.

35
00:02:32,088 --> 00:02:39,259
TRAVIS: Fullmetal Alchemist transmutation circle!

36
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:44,093
LAURA: We may or may not do voices in Fullmetal
Alchemist and Dragon Ball Z.

37
00:02:44,093 --> 00:02:47,139
ASHLEY: Full circle!

38
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:55,363
MATT: You got a cool poster!

39
00:02:55,363 --> 00:03:03,063
LAURA: You got a poster? Oh, there is a poster!
Oh, and little cell phone charms!

40
00:03:03,063 --> 00:03:08,334
MATT: Yeah, these are from Unity. These are little
feather charms from Unity.

41
00:03:08,334 --> 00:03:11,916
LIAM: Can someone save me a Loot Crate box?

42
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,589
TRAVIS: Shut up, Liam. You're not here!

43
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:16,734
LAURA: Sorry Liam, you're missing out. I'll save
you a cell phone charm.

44
00:03:16,734 --> 00:03:19,913
MATT: So we got an awesome Yokai shirt.

45
00:03:19,913 --> 00:03:23,395
ASHLEY: They're like little best friend charms.

46
00:03:23,395 --> 00:03:25,464
MARISHA: Yeah, they're like best friend charms.

47
00:03:25,464 --> 00:03:29,753
LAURA: And they're feathers! Actually, Liam, these
are really appropriate. They're feathers. I'll

48
00:03:29,753 --> 00:03:33,089
save you one!

49
00:03:33,089 --> 00:03:36,445
TRAVIS: This is going in the kitchen in front of
the sink. I'm going to stand on it and transmute

50
00:03:36,445 --> 00:03:38,239
my dishes into clean.

51
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,769
ASHLEY: I love this little plush.

52
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:43,971
TALIESIN: Most useful alchemist ever.

53
00:03:43,971 --> 00:03:48,184
MARISHA: Yay! Thanks, Loot Crate!

54
00:03:48,184 --> 00:03:52,051
MATT: Thank you, Loot Crate. Check it out, if it's
something you want to be part of, they send this

55
00:03:52,051 --> 00:03:54,526
stuff monthly, themed crates are awesome, we've
been at this for a long time.

56
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:56,530
LAURA: I didn't even know they had an Anime Loot
Crate. That's pretty cool.

57
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,589
MATT: And now you do, Laura. What!

58
00:03:58,589 --> 00:04:01,365
ASHLEY: (singing) The more you know!

59
00:04:01,365 --> 00:04:06,402
MATT: Awesome. So once again, that's criticalrole,
one word, on their website at

60
00:04:06,402 --> 00:04:15,842
lootcrate.com/criticalrole to get your discount for
being Critters and awesome. We have, also, Laura?

61
00:04:15,842 --> 00:04:24,764
LAURA: Oh, the t-shirt competition! Okay. So we
have officially selected the top three of our

62
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:31,140
choosing, and then we are now presenting them to
you guys to vote on. They are already up on

63
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:36,712
geekandsundry.com, so go and check them out and
make your votes heard, and we're going to be

64
00:04:36,712 --> 00:04:41,748
announcing the actual winner of the t-shirt
competition at our live show next week, so

65
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:49,240
everybody that comes and sees that will get to see
a picture of it live. Just like you guys at home.

66
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,127
TRAVIS: What a goober.

67
00:04:51,127 --> 00:04:54,309
MARISHA: You basically see it 30 seconds before
everyone else.

68
00:04:54,309 --> 00:04:57,346
LAURA: That 30 seconds makes a huge difference.

69
00:04:57,346 --> 00:04:58,415
MARISHA: It does.

70
00:04:58,415 --> 00:05:02,416
TALIESIN: We may be miming something while the
picture's up, and that'll be exclusive content.

71
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:07,205
ASHLEY: And there were so many good ones. It was so
hard.

72
00:05:07,205 --> 00:05:12,566
LAURA: The amount of texts that went back and
forth between all of us, trying to decide what the

73
00:05:12,566 --> 00:05:14,666
top three were going to be, was really--

74
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:20,291
MARISHA: It was like, okay, everybody pick your
top three, and so we each picked six. And they

75
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,717
were all different. And we're like, cool.

76
00:05:22,717 --> 00:05:26,197
TRAVIS: Which brings us to our next announcement,
which is we do have a live show next week!

77
00:05:26,197 --> 00:05:27,819
(cheering)

78
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:31,089
TRAVIS: We're going be at Landmark Theatres. It's
a sold-out show, somehow, because everybody's

79
00:05:31,089 --> 00:05:36,028
crazy and is coming to see it. We're going to be
there, in person, trying to pull off this live

80
00:05:36,028 --> 00:05:39,404
show thing. It's going to be wacky, it's going to
be zany. We're not going to have any clothes on.

81
00:05:39,404 --> 00:05:41,129
LAURA: No, that's not true.

82
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:46,932
MATT: You are welcome to come clothed.

83
00:05:46,932 --> 00:05:49,942
TRAVIS: I'm gonna sit in a sock, and that's it.

84
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,369
LAURA: No!

85
00:05:51,369 --> 00:05:54,480
MATT: Travis, it's already sold out, you don't
have to--

86
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,599
TRAVIS: It's the first of hopefully many, so we'll
see how it goes.

87
00:05:58,599 --> 00:06:03,054
MATT: Yeah, if it goes well and runs smoothly and
people are receptive to it, then hopefully there

88
00:06:03,054 --> 00:06:06,062
will be more of these at different places over the
country.

89
00:06:06,062 --> 00:06:15,361
SAM: Guys, one more quick announcement, over here
on the cool table. Joe Mad posters. You know

90
00:06:15,361 --> 00:06:19,804
them, you love them, they're up on
shop.geekandsundry.com. It's your last chance to

91
00:06:19,804 --> 00:06:26,359
preorder the unsigned limited edition Critical
Role poster. The poster size: it's not 23 by 35,

92
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:33,808
it's 24 by 36. We went the extra inch for you
guys. These posters will be removed from the

93
00:06:33,808 --> 00:06:41,118
website and deleted forever tomorrow at 1:00pm
Pacific. The cost is $40. Go buy it now. Sorry,

94
00:06:41,118 --> 00:06:46,663
Taliesin. Let me try that again.

95
00:06:46,663 --> 00:06:51,365
TRAVIS: We must reiterate, they are gorgeous. You
will want one of these for you or your friends.

96
00:06:51,365 --> 00:06:54,165
TALIESIN: Trust Scanlan. It's that extra inch that
makes all the difference.

97
00:06:54,165 --> 00:06:56,262
SAM: It's the extra inch, cubed.

98
00:06:56,262 --> 00:07:05,890
MATT: All right. Any other announcements anyone
wants to bring forward? I know Technomancer just

99
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,641
came out. I voice Sean Mancer in that.

100
00:07:08,641 --> 00:07:11,327
MARISHA: What just came out?

101
00:07:11,327 --> 00:07:12,335
MATT: Technomancer.

102
00:07:12,335 --> 00:07:14,379
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Oh, cool.

103
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:18,179
MATT: A game. It's a game. Anybody else have
anything?

104
00:07:18,179 --> 00:07:20,775
SAM: That's a very half-hearted plug, Matt.

105
00:07:20,775 --> 00:07:32,167
MATT: I just want to get in the game. It's a
thing. There's stuff in it. Yeah, I'm a little

106
00:07:32,167 --> 00:07:36,248
jet-lagged. But that doesn't matter, because
that's what energy drinks are for. All right guys,

107
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:40,891
let's dive in here to the proper part of tonight's
episode of Critical Role.

108
00:07:40,891 --> 00:07:43,771
TALIESIN: Opening credits!

109
00:07:43,771 --> 00:09:13,041
[dramatic music]

110
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:19,831
MATT: Welcome back! So we had a week off last week
where the amazing Liam O'Brien there ran a

111
00:09:19,831 --> 00:09:23,450
one-shot game of absolute chaos and did an amazing
job.

112
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:24,671
LAURA: It was pretty fun.

113
00:09:24,671 --> 00:09:26,587
MATT: If you guys haven't had an opportunity to
check it out, you should. It's up on

114
00:09:26,587 --> 00:09:31,584
geekandsundry.com. It's amazing, and made me and
Marisha very jealous that we couldn't play it, but

115
00:09:31,584 --> 00:09:38,023
we were here in spirit, and obviously, motorcycle
and sidecar. So that was fun. We'll show you some

116
00:09:38,023 --> 00:09:39,567
of the fanart.

117
00:09:39,567 --> 00:09:46,003
But anyway, back to this game. Vox Machina, the
group of adventurers who had found their way now

118
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:51,731
seeking the Vestiges of Divergence, ancient
artifacts of power, to help them in their struggle

119
00:09:51,731 --> 00:09:58,812
against the Chroma Conclave, the collection of
chromatic dragons that have razed the entire

120
00:09:58,812 --> 00:10:04,903
countryside of Tal'Dorei. They've acquired a few
of them, but the most recent one sends them to the

121
00:10:04,903 --> 00:10:11,819
Feywild in search of Fenthras, a bow which seems
to have acquired the eyes of Vex upon it.

122
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:21,082
You took care of some business, managed to ward
off an assassination attempt by a rakshasa, and

123
00:10:21,082 --> 00:10:29,823
found your way through Keyleth's Plane Shift spell
into the Feywild, somewhere in the vicinity of the

124
00:10:29,823 --> 00:10:37,297
portal where the nymph in the Frostweald, upon
meeting Vox Machina years before, supposedly lives.

125
00:10:37,297 --> 00:10:41,108
LAURA: Oh shit, Grog.

126
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:56,312
ASHLEY: Time to get some... tail. I was going to say
something else and then I realized-- Not sure

127
00:10:56,312 --> 00:10:58,073
where that came from.

128
00:10:58,073 --> 00:11:02,771
MATT: So to bring us back in. As you step out into
the temperate air, you're struck by the vibrant

129
00:11:02,771 --> 00:11:08,023
purples, blues and pinks of sunset that envelop
the skies and the clouds above the tree line. The

130
00:11:08,023 --> 00:11:12,010
smell of fresh morning dew and poppy upon the
breeze fills your head, and your feet wade through

131
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:16,961
tall, thick grasses that tickle your knees with
each step. Vine-covered tree trunks rise all

132
00:11:16,961 --> 00:11:21,820
around you, curling as they stretch upward like a
bending dreamscape, and hundreds of small, bobbing

133
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:26,412
faerie lights glow in the shadowed distance of the
forest. Looking about you, you can see what appear

134
00:11:26,412 --> 00:11:31,675
to be clusters of mud and small pools of water
that are scattered in your vicinity, some ten, 15,

135
00:11:31,675 --> 00:11:37,901
even 30 feet apart. Small, little pools that dot
the landscape almost like pebbles scattered across

136
00:11:37,901 --> 00:11:42,936
a small field. What do you guys want to do?

137
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:45,157
LAURA: Already?

138
00:11:45,157 --> 00:11:47,957
SAM: Where are we?

139
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,075
MARISHA: It's beautiful.

140
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:52,959
TRAVIS: I feel like we got drugged.

141
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,397
TALIESIN: This is fantastic.

142
00:11:55,397 --> 00:11:58,758
TRAVIS: Is anyone else seeing the colors and the
shapes and the--

143
00:11:58,758 --> 00:12:01,278
TALIESIN: Oh, it's everything I could have hoped
for.

144
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:07,025
MARISHA: I want to live here. It's amazing. Okay.

145
00:12:07,025 --> 00:12:12,013
LAURA: Well, I have no idea how to get our
bearings here, unfortunately.

146
00:12:12,013 --> 00:12:20,470
TALIESIN: Well. Is there any sign of any bit of
civilization or construction?

147
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,358
MATT: Make a perception check.

148
00:12:22,358 --> 00:12:23,794
TALIESIN: Oh lord.

149
00:12:23,794 --> 00:12:26,050
TRAVIS: First roll of the day. Don't fuck it up.

150
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:32,203
TALIESIN: Ah! Yay. 26.

151
00:12:32,203 --> 00:12:38,669
MATT: 26, okay. As you guys are taking in the
vicinity, Percy, glancing around, you see no signs

152
00:12:38,669 --> 00:12:48,425
of civilization. The only thing that catches your
eye is a little ways past the immediate tree line,

153
00:12:48,425 --> 00:12:55,530
that meets your eye, the fairy lights seem to be
caressing the outside of some sort of older stone

154
00:12:55,530 --> 00:13:00,482
structure. And that's about as much as you can
make out. Looks about four or five feet tall, and

155
00:13:00,482 --> 00:13:03,239
it's only barely visible between two of the
trunks.

156
00:13:03,239 --> 00:13:05,610
TALIESIN: I think I see a thing. I'm heading in
that direction.

157
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:09,768
MARISHA: Oh! I want to go see a thing. I want to
go! I take off after Percy.

158
00:13:09,768 --> 00:13:16,414
TRAVIS: We can always let them go first and they
die, and then we go.

159
00:13:16,414 --> 00:13:19,870
LAURA: Perhaps it might be wise to move quietly.

160
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:22,075
TALIESIN: We are already going.

161
00:13:22,075 --> 00:13:23,556
LAURA: Brilliant.

162
00:13:23,556 --> 00:13:28,524
LIAM: You remember what our teachers said of this
place. It's pretty, but it's dangerous.

163
00:13:28,524 --> 00:13:31,394
LAURA: It's very dangerous, and I'm afraid they
don't understand.

164
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:34,143
MARISHA: Guys, look! They're fireflies!

165
00:13:34,143 --> 00:13:38,672
TALIESIN: Wait, don't touch. Don't touch. We're
going to head towards the stone.

166
00:13:38,672 --> 00:13:43,753
MATT: Okay. You make your way across these
extremely thick, moss-covered tree trunks. You

167
00:13:43,753 --> 00:13:48,092
push past the two and eventually come upon the
structure, and as you get closer, the fairy lights

168
00:13:48,092 --> 00:13:53,842
dim and vanish, as soon as you get within five or
six feet of them, and they seem to only appear at

169
00:13:53,842 --> 00:13:59,435
a peripheral point. You guys approach the stone
structure?

170
00:13:59,435 --> 00:14:05,208
LIAM: Do Vex and I have memories of these from our
tutoring in Elftown?

171
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:11,097
MATT: Not particularly. Nothing about it strikes
you as part of the general Feywild lore. There are

172
00:14:11,097 --> 00:14:15,597
structures that have been built throughout periods
of time, some of which have fallen to ruin. Nature

173
00:14:15,597 --> 00:14:20,136
in the Feywild tends to reclaim things that aren't
natural if left to their own devices.

174
00:14:20,136 --> 00:14:22,749
LIAM: But the lights, we never heard anything
about those lights?

175
00:14:22,749 --> 00:14:24,223
LAURA: (whispering) Will-o'-wisps.

176
00:14:24,223 --> 00:14:27,388
LIAM: Well, Liam knows that, but I'm asking if Vax
does.

177
00:14:27,388 --> 00:14:33,663
MATT: I would say, have both of you guys roll
history checks, for the both of you. Vex and Vax.

178
00:14:33,663 --> 00:14:35,992
TALIESIN: Can I add into that, too?

179
00:14:35,992 --> 00:14:38,133
MATT: You would not.

180
00:14:38,133 --> 00:14:41,252
TALIESIN: I learned Elven. I was a bit of a nerd.

181
00:14:41,252 --> 00:14:44,908
MATT: You learned Elven, but elven culture and the
Feywild are two entirely different things.

182
00:14:44,908 --> 00:14:47,075
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, I'm aware my head's full of
bullshit, too.

183
00:14:47,075 --> 00:14:49,178
LAURA: 20.

184
00:14:49,178 --> 00:14:51,286
LIAM: Just a 13.

185
00:14:51,286 --> 00:14:57,050
MATT: 13, okay. Best that you can ascertain, the
first worry initially, and you have encountered

186
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:02,086
something like this before: will-o'-wisps,
entities that were the lost souls of individuals

187
00:15:02,086 --> 00:15:08,893
that died under tragic circumstances in swamps and
bogs and in heavily wooded areas. However, those

188
00:15:08,893 --> 00:15:14,795
entities are usually larger and are drawn towards
sources of life. The fact that these are much

189
00:15:14,795 --> 00:15:21,531
smaller and tend to fade at your arrival means
either they're not will-o'-wisps at all, or a

190
00:15:21,531 --> 00:15:24,439
different kind you haven't encountered. That's as
much information that you can deal with.

191
00:15:24,439 --> 00:15:26,735
LIAM: I wonder if they're fairy folk.

192
00:15:26,735 --> 00:15:28,243
LAURA: Maybe.

193
00:15:28,243 --> 00:15:30,735
TALIESIN: Now, don't touch. We'll stay 11 paces
away.

194
00:15:30,735 --> 00:15:32,013
MARISHA: Okay.

195
00:15:32,013 --> 00:15:34,385
MATT: I'd like you both to make stealth checks if
you could.

196
00:15:34,385 --> 00:15:35,599
MARISHA: Okay.

197
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:38,747
MATT: Anybody else going up with them, or is just
the two of them?

198
00:15:38,747 --> 00:15:40,487
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck those pieces of bait.

199
00:15:40,487 --> 00:15:44,522
LAURA: Can I climb a tree? Close by.

200
00:15:44,522 --> 00:15:46,618
MATT: Make an athletics check.

201
00:15:46,618 --> 00:15:56,282
LAURA: Athletics. Can I use my acrobatics to hop
up? Ooh! Swing myself? Parkour?

202
00:15:56,282 --> 00:16:02,310
MATT: Roll athletics with disadvantage, just
because I'm giving you a chance.

203
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,628
LAURA: Acrobatics, with disadvantage?

204
00:16:04,628 --> 00:16:05,877
MATT: Yes.

205
00:16:05,877 --> 00:16:08,646
LAURA: 24.

206
00:16:08,646 --> 00:16:11,762
MATT: Okay. This is the one time you've bartered
with the DM this session.

207
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:16,014
LAURA: Oh no! I should've saved it!

208
00:16:16,014 --> 00:16:19,985
MATT: You do manage to leap across. Because these
trees are thickly wooded and the branch line

209
00:16:19,985 --> 00:16:25,897
starts at about the four-foot mark anyway, it's
fairly easy for you to leap up the top of the tree

210
00:16:25,897 --> 00:16:29,264
without an issue. You vanish up into the canopy.
You two, what'd you roll for stealth?

211
00:16:29,264 --> 00:16:30,463
MARISHA: A 20.

212
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,827
TALIESIN: And a 12.

213
00:16:31,827 --> 00:16:33,331
MATT: And Liam, what'd you get?

214
00:16:33,331 --> 00:16:37,202
LIAM: I didn't roll anything. I just wanted to
call out: you couldn't have used the broom for that?

215
00:16:37,202 --> 00:16:39,567
LAURA: (laughs) Nope!

216
00:16:39,567 --> 00:16:45,049
TALIESIN: And we're keeping about 11 feet, so. At
least.

217
00:16:45,049 --> 00:16:50,230
MATT: 11 feet, okay. You approach this stone
structure, which you see now is the corner part of

218
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:56,519
a wall. It looks like there was some sort of a
small structure here. Best that you can make out,

219
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:02,735
all of it's heavily covered with vine and ivy, and
all the places where the stonework is broken looks

220
00:17:02,735 --> 00:17:07,661
to be through natural erosion or claimed by actual
roots, and you can see now part of the tree roots

221
00:17:07,661 --> 00:17:13,039
have actually risen up and tore down elements of
these walls, and you can see broken rubble barely

222
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:19,234
poking through the very thick underbrush of this
forest. Whatever was here was built a long time

223
00:17:19,234 --> 00:17:22,901
ago and has been mostly reclaimed by the forest.

224
00:17:22,901 --> 00:17:24,444
TALIESIN: Inner corner or outer corner?

225
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:29,827
MATT: The corner is facing you guys, so you're on
the outside of where the structure would have been.

226
00:17:29,827 --> 00:17:33,890
MARISHA: It's a ruin? Or are there walls that
continue on?

227
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:39,521
MATT: This is a ruin, but most of it's been torn
down and it's not visible. Sections of walls

228
00:17:39,521 --> 00:17:42,240
available. The largest piece is currently the
corner you're facing.

229
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,861
MARISHA: Interesting.

230
00:17:43,861 --> 00:17:49,386
TALIESIN: Go ahead. I'm going to sit and quietly
sketch for a moment. I'm taking everything down.

231
00:17:49,386 --> 00:17:58,638
MARISHA: Can I do a check to see if I can
recognize who might've built this stone structure?

232
00:17:58,638 --> 00:18:02,857
MATT: Make a history check.

233
00:18:02,857 --> 00:18:06,278
MARISHA: Ten.

234
00:18:06,278 --> 00:18:13,151
MATT: You have no idea. The planes you've studied
are the planes of the elemental form. The Feywild

235
00:18:13,151 --> 00:18:18,237
is a little ways outside of your realm of any
training or storytime you've been given growing

236
00:18:18,237 --> 00:18:22,432
up. Most of what you've gleaned about it thus far
has been based on the conversations you've had in

237
00:18:22,432 --> 00:18:23,989
recent weeks.

238
00:18:23,989 --> 00:18:26,718
TRAVIS: Are there a lot of pastel colors all over
the place?

239
00:18:26,718 --> 00:18:36,336
MATT: It ranges from, at least in this forest, a
very deep lush dark green, like a heavy winter's pine

240
00:18:36,336 --> 00:18:44,461
green. The forests are more vine-wrapped, mossy,
willow-ish trees that hang down.

241
00:18:44,461 --> 00:18:47,315
TRAVIS: Okay, so not crazy LSD colors going.

242
00:18:47,315 --> 00:18:56,421
MATT: No. However, the evening sky is very purple
and orange, like around a very bright dusk. And

243
00:18:56,421 --> 00:19:00,678
that colorscape does contrast with the green of
the forest quite beautifully.

244
00:19:00,678 --> 00:19:02,124
TRAVIS: Is it dusk?

245
00:19:02,124 --> 00:19:03,925
MATT: It looks to be getting to dusk, yeah.

246
00:19:03,925 --> 00:19:05,343
TALIESIN: It may or may not be.

247
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,987
TRAVIS: What does that mean?

248
00:19:06,987 --> 00:19:10,498
LAURA: Time is different in the Feywild.

249
00:19:10,498 --> 00:19:15,568
TALIESIN: So there's no carvings that I can see on
this outer wall, nothing?

250
00:19:15,568 --> 00:19:16,976
MATT: Not from ten feet away, no.

251
00:19:16,976 --> 00:19:19,664
TALIESIN: And the vines that are climbing on it,
are they flowering anything at all?

252
00:19:19,664 --> 00:19:26,869
MATT: The vines that are there do have small
whitish flower buds. Little flowers that have been

253
00:19:26,869 --> 00:19:30,123
blooming in a small scale across the vines.

254
00:19:30,123 --> 00:19:33,425
MARISHA: Do they look like anything that we have
on our plane?

255
00:19:33,425 --> 00:19:39,318
MATT: Not particularly. They look like white
flowers from this distance. You'd have to get

256
00:19:39,318 --> 00:19:40,645
closer to inspect directly.

257
00:19:40,645 --> 00:19:41,629
MARISHA: Can I do that?

258
00:19:41,629 --> 00:19:42,560
MATT: Sure.

259
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,044
TALIESIN: Be very careful. Nothing here is exactly
what it appears to be.

260
00:19:45,044 --> 00:19:49,381
MARISHA: I won't touch it! I'm going to-- it's so
pretty.

261
00:19:49,381 --> 00:19:50,992
LIAM: Vex'ahlia!

262
00:19:50,992 --> 00:19:52,483
LAURA: What? Yes?

263
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:56,417
LIAM: Do you want to go higher and get a bird's
eye view? Maybe that's not safe, but--

264
00:19:56,417 --> 00:19:59,520
LAURA: That's why I'm staying in the trees,
brother.

265
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,372
LIAM: I meant even higher.

266
00:20:01,372 --> 00:20:03,555
LAURA: I will if it looks safe.

267
00:20:03,555 --> 00:20:04,972
LIAM: All right.

268
00:20:04,972 --> 00:20:06,369
LAURA: Does it look safe?

269
00:20:06,369 --> 00:20:17,505
MATT: The canopy is very thick, and only in these
small little patches of meadow, like the one that

270
00:20:17,505 --> 00:20:20,542
you entered and had all the little pools in it,
and the one that you're entering now which has the

271
00:20:20,542 --> 00:20:23,575
ruin, have little breaks in the canopy where you
can actually see the sky. Otherwise, it's very

272
00:20:23,575 --> 00:20:27,937
thick, so actually flying through the canopy,
unless you're going very slowly, is going to be

273
00:20:27,937 --> 00:20:29,670
whipping you and probably knocking you off.

274
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:34,084
LAURA: Can I see from my height, can I see a
better view of the ruins and everything?

275
00:20:34,084 --> 00:20:39,020
MATT: You can make your way up there a little bit.
Make a perception check. Keyleth, you approach the

276
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,645
ruin to get a closer look at the plants? Make a
nature check.

277
00:20:41,645 --> 00:20:43,671
LAURA: Oh! And this is forest, right?

278
00:20:43,671 --> 00:20:45,887
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Oh!

279
00:20:45,887 --> 00:20:48,823
MARISHA: 30.

280
00:20:48,823 --> 00:21:00,751
MATT: Okay. These white flowers resemble a form of
daisy that exists in Tal'Dorei. However, they grow

281
00:21:00,751 --> 00:21:06,058
there in flower clusters out of the ground. You've
never seen them sprout from a vine, and the

282
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:11,898
shape's a little different, and you don't actually
know this form of plant from your personal

283
00:21:11,898 --> 00:21:15,419
experience, but you can ascertain a similar nature
to it.

284
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:16,967
TRAVIS: Nothing is what it seems.

285
00:21:16,967 --> 00:21:22,944
MARISHA: A "feysy." Are they poisonous or anything
like that?

286
00:21:22,944 --> 00:21:24,754
MATT: They don't appear to be toxic, no.

287
00:21:24,754 --> 00:21:28,399
MARISHA: Can I touch it?

288
00:21:28,399 --> 00:21:33,782
MATT: As you reach out and touch it with your
finger, I need you to go ahead and do nothing,

289
00:21:33,782 --> 00:21:35,159
because it's fine.

290
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:40,258
LAURA: You sneaky. Here we go.

291
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:42,712
TRAVIS: "As you" always means doom.

292
00:21:42,712 --> 00:21:45,527
LAURA: I got 25 on my perception.

293
00:21:45,527 --> 00:21:52,101
MATT: Okay. As you rocket up past the boughs and
begin to emerge from the edge of the canopy over

294
00:21:52,101 --> 00:21:57,407
this opening, you do see a very large water pool
on the other side of this ruin. You can see where

295
00:21:57,407 --> 00:22:04,212
this ruin used to be. Most of it has fallen and
then sunken into what appears to be a very glassy

296
00:22:04,212 --> 00:22:10,516
pool of water. A still surface, untouched. There's
no wind in this area. It's a perfectly reflective

297
00:22:10,516 --> 00:22:13,419
surface to the opening above it.

298
00:22:13,419 --> 00:22:17,034
LAURA: Do I see any life forms around?

299
00:22:17,034 --> 00:22:25,714
MATT: You don't see any life forms. You do see a
bare minimum hint of movement, if you will,

300
00:22:25,714 --> 00:22:29,834
beneath the water. You can't make out the shape,
but you do see something moving beneath the water.

301
00:22:29,834 --> 00:22:36,393
LAURA: Does this look similar to the pool that was
on the other side of the portal?

302
00:22:36,393 --> 00:22:37,828
MATT: It's a pool.

303
00:22:37,828 --> 00:22:39,245
LAURA: I wouldn't know?

304
00:22:39,245 --> 00:22:43,044
MATT: It looks like water. And you've seen a
number that you've come past in this way. This

305
00:22:43,044 --> 00:22:44,516
one's larger than the others.

306
00:22:44,516 --> 00:22:47,685
MARISHA: I want to pick the little white flower.

307
00:22:47,685 --> 00:22:48,911
TALIESIN: Oh, I wouldn't do that!

308
00:22:48,911 --> 00:22:55,420
LAURA: I come down and I watch as Keyleth makes a
stupid move. Don't pick anything.

309
00:22:55,420 --> 00:23:01,776
MATT: You pluck the flower. As you pluck it, the
vines begin to writhe and pull away from the

310
00:23:01,776 --> 00:23:06,978
stone, actually releasing the hold on the ruin,
and as it does, you hear what sounds like some

311
00:23:06,978 --> 00:23:11,739
movement, some shifting of water on the other side
of the stone wall.

312
00:23:11,739 --> 00:23:14,168
LAURA: There was something in the water on the
other side of the ruins.

313
00:23:14,168 --> 00:23:17,556
MARISHA: I take the flower and I put it back.

314
00:23:17,556 --> 00:23:22,213
MATT: The vine has retracted, and as you set it
towards the vine, it tumbles off. And actually the

315
00:23:22,213 --> 00:23:26,416
flower, you see now as you reach down, it has
turned from a beautiful white and has immediately

316
00:23:26,416 --> 00:23:28,340
withered into a black, dried husk.

317
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:33,531
TRAVIS: Wow. We've been here five minutes.

318
00:23:33,531 --> 00:23:36,065
MARISHA: I was going to press it and keep it.

319
00:23:36,065 --> 00:23:39,673
LAURA: I'm not lying. We should probably hide!

320
00:23:39,673 --> 00:23:45,358
MATT: Where was once silence, you hear the rushing
of leaves as the canopy's beginning to close over,

321
00:23:45,358 --> 00:23:49,931
like the trees are leaning in and the actual
branches themselves are starting to close up the

322
00:23:49,931 --> 00:23:51,703
gap in space on the sky.

323
00:23:51,703 --> 00:23:53,435
LIAM: I'm going stealth! Ducking into the grass!

324
00:23:53,435 --> 00:23:55,103
MATT: Stealth check on both you guys.

325
00:23:55,103 --> 00:23:58,133
SAM: I'm hanging back with Grog. I've been
scratching my back on his knee for a while.

326
00:23:58,133 --> 00:24:00,249
TRAVIS: I don't see what the big deal is, really.

327
00:24:00,249 --> 00:24:01,442
LAURA: 29.

328
00:24:01,442 --> 00:24:02,536
MATT: Okay.

329
00:24:02,536 --> 00:24:04,764
LIAM: 34.

330
00:24:04,764 --> 00:24:10,415
MATT: Okay. Both of you guys-- you go back into
the branch, and you can feel the branches pushing

331
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:15,361
behind you, and you have to actually get low to
not be dragged away with the rest of these

332
00:24:15,361 --> 00:24:20,941
extending branches that are closing off the
opening in the canopy. Vax, you make your way

333
00:24:20,941 --> 00:24:26,179
towards one of the tree trunks and dart out of the
way. Percy, you're watching this in horror.

334
00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:28,960
TALIESIN: I'm trying to very gently back her up.

335
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:37,107
MATT: Okay. It's at this point, you guys see a
hand creep up over the stone. A secondary hand.

336
00:24:37,107 --> 00:24:42,695
MARISHA: Maybe it's his version of a doorbell. You
pick a plant and you get--

337
00:24:42,695 --> 00:24:52,835
MATT: Pulling up from here, you now see what
appears to be a humanoid female form, lithe, hair

338
00:24:52,835 --> 00:24:56,104
wet and slicked back, and as the head peeks
over--

339
00:24:56,104 --> 00:25:00,909
TALIESIN: I bow. And I push her down.

340
00:25:00,909 --> 00:25:08,734
MATT: Okay. The moment there is any movement, she
flickers and moves back from the wall, looking

341
00:25:08,734 --> 00:25:13,737
already very perturbed by this whole circumstance.
I need both of you guys to make constitution

342
00:25:13,737 --> 00:25:15,150
saving throws.

343
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:21,854
MARISHA: Oh, not bad. 21.

344
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:23,525
TALIESIN: Natural one.

345
00:25:23,525 --> 00:25:28,567
MATT: Natural one. As you're shoved ahead, and
begin to go into a bow, Percy, you bow, but you

346
00:25:28,567 --> 00:25:33,071
can't take your eyes off of it as the creature
pulls herself up over the wall. An extremely

347
00:25:33,071 --> 00:25:41,126
beautiful, impossibly beautiful woman, nude, steps
up over the edge of the wall, and as you glance

348
00:25:41,126 --> 00:25:48,752
forward, everything goes dark. Blackness.

349
00:25:48,752 --> 00:25:51,150
MARISHA: Is he still conscious?

350
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:55,637
MATT: You bow, and he appears to be bowing. He's
still standing; he's fine.

351
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,689
TALIESIN: Hello?

352
00:25:57,689 --> 00:26:02,094
MATT: As soon as you say that, the creature darts
backward, and you see it take a few steps and then

353
00:26:02,094 --> 00:26:06,765
leap and dives into the pool and vanishes beneath
the water's surface. Although you see that,

354
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:09,168
Keyleth. Percy, you do not. You just hear
footsteps.

355
00:26:09,168 --> 00:26:13,667
TALIESIN: Oh dear.

356
00:26:13,667 --> 00:26:15,572
LAURA: What happened?

357
00:26:15,572 --> 00:26:18,940
TALIESIN: We're going to have to find her.

358
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,543
LAURA: Did she say anything?

359
00:26:20,543 --> 00:26:21,610
TALIESIN: No.

360
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:24,174
MARISHA: She was very pretty. Are you okay?

361
00:26:24,174 --> 00:26:28,748
TALIESIN: I think she blinded me. No, she blinded
me.

362
00:26:28,748 --> 00:26:33,857
MATT: And you look at Percy, eyes wide open,
glancing about, the pupils moving about.

363
00:26:33,857 --> 00:26:37,440
TALIESIN: Yes, I'm blinded. I'm blind.

364
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,054
MARISHA: Okay.

365
00:26:39,054 --> 00:26:40,221
TRAVIS: Really?

366
00:26:40,221 --> 00:26:42,126
SAM: We should test it out.

367
00:26:42,126 --> 00:26:43,982
TRAVIS: Yeah. How many fingers am I holding up?

368
00:26:43,982 --> 00:26:45,251
TALIESIN: One.

369
00:26:45,251 --> 00:26:48,715
(laughter)

370
00:26:48,715 --> 00:26:52,690
TRAVIS: He's a liar! He can see fine. Piece of
shit.

371
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:57,171
LAURA: Grog! Did you recognize that woman?

372
00:26:57,171 --> 00:27:00,204
MATT: Were you paying attention?

373
00:27:00,204 --> 00:27:01,216
TRAVIS: No.

374
00:27:01,216 --> 00:27:03,394
(laughter)

375
00:27:03,394 --> 00:27:07,612
LAURA: You didn't see the naked woman come up over
that wall?

376
00:27:07,612 --> 00:27:12,914
TRAVIS: Where? Hold on. Did you hear that?

377
00:27:12,914 --> 00:27:16,342
SAM: If there was a naked woman, I would have
seen it.

378
00:27:16,342 --> 00:27:20,389
TALIESIN: I'm going to curl up in a little ball
for a minute and rock.

379
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:24,206
MATT: Okay. Percy crawls onto the ground and
begins rocking back and forth.

380
00:27:24,206 --> 00:27:31,307
LAURA: I come down out of the tree. Can you just
be quiet for two seconds?

381
00:27:31,307 --> 00:27:33,314
MARISHA: Maybe it'll wear off in a minute?

382
00:27:33,314 --> 00:27:37,822
LAURA: (shushing) Grog.

383
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:38,889
TRAVIS: What?

384
00:27:38,889 --> 00:27:42,157
LAURA: There was a naked woman. In a pool.

385
00:27:42,157 --> 00:27:43,516
SAM: Go on.

386
00:27:43,516 --> 00:27:49,766
LAURA: That reminded me of maybe the pool on the
other side. We were jumping over from close to

387
00:27:49,766 --> 00:27:55,712
that portal, right? Could it be the nymph that you
stole the heart of?

388
00:27:55,712 --> 00:27:57,613
MARISHA: She was very pretty.

389
00:27:57,613 --> 00:27:59,507
TRAVIS: I don't know. Maybe.

390
00:27:59,507 --> 00:28:05,029
LAURA: Would it be safe for you to see her again
and maybe ask for her to cure our friend here or

391
00:28:05,029 --> 00:28:08,401
would you-- Is she dangerous to be around?

392
00:28:08,401 --> 00:28:10,283
TRAVIS: Well, she didn't blind me.

393
00:28:10,283 --> 00:28:11,691
LAURA: What'd she do to you?

394
00:28:11,691 --> 00:28:13,500
TRAVIS: That's none of your business.

395
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:20,588
LAURA: Well, I worry if we go try to talk to her
if it's not her, then she could blind all of us.

396
00:28:20,588 --> 00:28:25,136
TRAVIS: I don't know. My chick didn't blind me, so
if she did, I think we need to kill her.

397
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:31,706
TALIESIN: I'm going to take out my Dragonslayer
Longsword and stand up and start using it as a

398
00:28:31,706 --> 00:28:36,090
cane. Find my way to Grog and poke him with it.

399
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:40,095
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check.

400
00:28:40,095 --> 00:28:45,834
TALIESIN: Better. That's 18.

401
00:28:45,834 --> 00:28:49,974
MATT: Okay. As they're having this conversation,
you--

402
00:28:49,974 --> 00:28:51,508
TALIESIN: Just a tap.

403
00:28:51,508 --> 00:28:58,131
MATT: You find your way over, and sure enough, no
person has the leg density that Grog does, and

404
00:28:58,131 --> 00:28:59,447
you're pretty sure you have your mark.

405
00:28:59,447 --> 00:29:03,085
TALIESIN: Going to give it a good little whack.
Oh, I'm sorry! It's so hard to see.

406
00:29:03,085 --> 00:29:06,945
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, I need to be more sensitive--
look out, it's a parrot! And I kick the sword.

407
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:10,020
MARISHA: A parrot?

408
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,886
TRAVIS: Yeah, there are rabid parrots out here in
the Feywild.

409
00:29:12,886 --> 00:29:15,591
SAM: He kicked the sword.

410
00:29:15,591 --> 00:29:21,289
TRAVIS: Oh, you know what? Just go pick it up.

411
00:29:21,289 --> 00:29:23,151
(laughter)

412
00:29:23,151 --> 00:29:30,365
TRAVIS: Let me get it for you. I'll hold onto it,
since you're obviously useless now. I go pick up

413
00:29:30,365 --> 00:29:32,391
the Dragonslayer Longsword.

414
00:29:32,391 --> 00:29:39,862
LIAM: I walk over to Percival. Percival, I'm
worried you're going to walk your glasses into a

415
00:29:39,862 --> 00:29:43,344
tree or something. Do you want one of us to hold
those for the time being?

416
00:29:43,344 --> 00:29:45,514
TALIESIN: I'll take them off and put them in my
pocket.

417
00:29:45,514 --> 00:29:49,582
LIAM: Do you have something to put them inside of,
besides just the pocket? I don't want you falling on them.

418
00:29:49,582 --> 00:29:53,586
TALIESIN: No. I've got a thing. It'll be all
right.

419
00:29:53,586 --> 00:29:57,356
LAURA: Percival, would you like something to hold
onto as you walk?

420
00:29:57,356 --> 00:30:05,264
TALIESIN: Actually, if you don't mind, can I
borrow a bear? Yes.

421
00:30:05,264 --> 00:30:08,165
LAURA: Yes, of course. I pop Trinket out.

422
00:30:08,165 --> 00:30:11,201
MATT: Okay. Trinket. (whoosh, bear noises)

423
00:30:11,201 --> 00:30:12,768
LAURA: Hi, buddy!

424
00:30:12,768 --> 00:30:17,999
MATT: Jowls shake as you rub your fingers into his
fur.

425
00:30:18,055 --> 00:30:21,742
LAURA: Trinket, we're in a very weird place. A
weird place. Things can happen.

426
00:30:21,742 --> 00:30:26,682
MARISHA: And I whisper to Trinket: don't crush the
flowers.

427
00:30:26,682 --> 00:30:31,144
TALIESIN: I'm willing to try and make this work
for a moment.

428
00:30:31,144 --> 00:30:37,835
LAURA: Trinket, can you help Percival walk? He's
blind.

429
00:30:37,835 --> 00:30:42,722
LIAM: Matt! Pike is with us, right?

430
00:30:42,722 --> 00:30:44,095
MATT: No.

431
00:30:44,095 --> 00:30:45,464
LIAM: No? Okay.

432
00:30:45,464 --> 00:30:49,924
LAURA: She's back in Whitestone.

433
00:30:49,924 --> 00:30:53,714
LIAM: All right. I robot out once in a while on
Skype. I guess I missed that.

434
00:30:53,714 --> 00:31:03,370
MATT: That's okay. All right, so you feel the
somewhat damp, cold nose of a bear nudge under

435
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:07,615
your hand, and then (bear noises) and a shoulder
lunges into you.

436
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:11,427
LAURA: Now don't walk him into any trees, Trinket
dear.

437
00:31:11,427 --> 00:31:16,818
TALIESIN: Do you mind? I'm going to try and hop on
top. I'm going to make a leap to get on top of the bear.

438
00:31:16,818 --> 00:31:22,033
MATT: Okay. It takes you a little while, but you
get up onto the bear eventually. You have to right

439
00:31:22,033 --> 00:31:24,388
him because he's facing the wrong direction a
little.

440
00:31:24,388 --> 00:31:29,878
TRAVIS: All right. So wait, can we be clear? You
picked a flower, all the trees got pissed off, you

441
00:31:29,878 --> 00:31:36,941
went blind, some naked chick jumped a wall, and
that's the story of what's happened so far? We are

442
00:31:36,941 --> 00:31:38,738
killing it right now.

443
00:31:38,738 --> 00:31:41,130
LAURA: Don't touch anything.

444
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:44,231
TRAVIS: I feel like maybe we need a change in
leadership. Just saying.

445
00:31:44,231 --> 00:31:46,833
MARISHA: There are very large consequences for
picking flowers.

446
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:50,221
SAM: All right, which way did she go?

447
00:31:50,221 --> 00:31:52,309
LAURA: She jumped over the wall here.

448
00:31:52,309 --> 00:31:53,995
SAM: Should we follow?

449
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:57,547
TRAVIS: Yeah. Vax? Can you get a pair of eyes on
her without going blind?

450
00:31:57,547 --> 00:32:02,097
LIAM: I don't feel confident about that.

451
00:32:02,097 --> 00:32:04,587
LAURA: I can try.

452
00:32:04,587 --> 00:32:06,871
TALIESIN: Which direction was this pool?

453
00:32:06,871 --> 00:32:14,080
LAURA: It's right past the ruins. Right there,
darling, can't you see? Grog, do you want to give

454
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,181
it a go?

455
00:32:15,181 --> 00:32:16,527
TRAVIS: What? Go look for her?

456
00:32:16,527 --> 00:32:17,888
LAURA: Just go see if it's her?

457
00:32:17,888 --> 00:32:18,863
TRAVIS: All right. Fuck it.

458
00:32:18,863 --> 00:32:20,232
LAURA: Be quiet-- okay.

459
00:32:20,232 --> 00:32:22,506
TRAVIS: No. And I do a full vault over the wall.

460
00:32:22,506 --> 00:32:27,973
MATT: You land, feet go (squelch) into the muddy
outskirts of the pond. It's about up to your

461
00:32:28,097 --> 00:32:30,795
ankles, but you can see the water is now rippled
and disturbed.

462
00:32:30,795 --> 00:32:33,208
TRAVIS: Can I stick my fingers in the mud. Does it
smell weird?

463
00:32:33,208 --> 00:32:37,546
MATT: Smells like probably the freshest poolside
mud you've ever come across.

464
00:32:37,546 --> 00:32:42,385
TRAVIS: I wipe it across my chest. Do I see any
footprints from where naked chick went?

465
00:32:42,385 --> 00:32:43,672
MATT: No, none.

466
00:32:43,672 --> 00:32:44,824
TRAVIS: What?

467
00:32:44,824 --> 00:32:46,227
LAURA: She went in the water, Grog.

468
00:32:46,227 --> 00:32:47,625
TRAVIS: She left no traces!

469
00:32:47,625 --> 00:32:52,018
LAURA: She was in the water before.

470
00:32:52,018 --> 00:32:55,110
TRAVIS: Does anyone want to come with me to the
water?

471
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,452
LAURA: I'll come with you to the water.

472
00:32:56,452 --> 00:32:57,865
TALIESIN: I'll go with you.

473
00:32:57,865 --> 00:32:59,875
TRAVIS: You're not going anywhere!

474
00:32:59,875 --> 00:33:01,869
TALIESIN: Trinket!

475
00:33:01,869 --> 00:33:05,446
MARISHA: I'll go get your eyes back! Okay.

476
00:33:05,446 --> 00:33:12,744
TRAVIS: All right. I cautiously make my way down.
How far is the water? Can I see it from where I am now?

477
00:33:12,744 --> 00:33:15,189
MATT: Yeah. It's about maybe ten feet from you.

478
00:33:15,189 --> 00:33:18,732
TRAVIS: All right, I'll stealthily make my way ten
feet towards it.

479
00:33:18,732 --> 00:33:20,046
MATT: Roll a stealth check.

480
00:33:20,046 --> 00:33:21,365
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch.

481
00:33:21,365 --> 00:33:23,059
MATT: You put it in the descriptor, man.

482
00:33:23,059 --> 00:33:24,782
TRAVIS: I did. 17.

483
00:33:24,782 --> 00:33:31,042
MATT: Okay. (squelching) You make your way, as
markedly quiet as you can.

484
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:34,206
MARISHA: I'm going to sit on the wall and watch
for a second.

485
00:33:34,206 --> 00:33:38,293
MATT: Okay. You come up to the edge of the water,
and you can see some of the ripples are starting

486
00:33:38,293 --> 00:33:46,221
to lap across the mud. The mud and silt continues
downward into a perfectly clear pool, though the

487
00:33:46,221 --> 00:33:49,626
light source has been cut off from the sky now as
the canopy has closed, and what little bit of

488
00:33:49,626 --> 00:33:57,421
light happens to find its way through the forest
ceiling-- other than that, it's pretty dark.

489
00:33:57,421 --> 00:34:01,158
However, you do have darkvision; a few of you do
have darkvision, so it's not a huge hindrance

490
00:34:01,158 --> 00:34:08,168
within a certain distance. You do see what appears
to be clouds of silt on the bottom of the water

491
00:34:08,168 --> 00:34:11,611
that have slowly found their way close to
resting.

492
00:34:11,611 --> 00:34:20,276
TRAVIS: Can I call out: hello? 
Nothing?

493
00:34:20,276 --> 00:34:22,731
MATT: No immediate response, no.

494
00:34:22,731 --> 00:34:29,448
TRAVIS: Can I reach in the Bag of Holding and grab
a basilisk egg? And can I try to launch it as far

495
00:34:29,448 --> 00:34:31,269
as I can into the pool?

496
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:35,138
MATT: Yeah. Go ahead and make a strength check.

497
00:34:35,138 --> 00:34:38,877
LIAM: I'm going to scramble up next to Keyleth to
watch this.

498
00:34:38,877 --> 00:34:40,180
MATT: Okay.

499
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,517
TRAVIS: 23.

500
00:34:41,517 --> 00:34:47,370
MATT: 23. You lob the egg with perfect accuracy
directly into the center of the pool. It hits and

501
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:55,375
floats on the surface, semi-buoyant, with a little
bit of the shell revealed on the top. A few

502
00:34:55,375 --> 00:35:00,331
moments pass before a few fingers curl up and grab
it, and pull it down below.

503
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:03,252
TRAVIS: Oh! I saw a hand!

504
00:35:03,252 --> 00:35:05,147
SAM: Did you recognize the hand?

505
00:35:05,147 --> 00:35:12,124
TRAVIS: No, I'm not like Ray Charles. I can't tell if
someone's attractive just by their hands.

506
00:35:12,124 --> 00:35:17,689
MARISHA: Grog. Do you know how to float? Do you
know how to float on top of water?

507
00:35:17,689 --> 00:35:18,977
TRAVIS: Yeah?

508
00:35:18,977 --> 00:35:20,560
MARISHA: You should do that.

509
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,780
TRAVIS: You want me to put my body in there?

510
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,585
MARISHA: Right. Don't we want to talk to her?

511
00:35:25,585 --> 00:35:27,525
TRAVIS: What if there's more than one her?

512
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:31,098
LIAM: It went really well for you the last time
that this happened.

513
00:35:31,098 --> 00:35:35,560
MARISHA: Yeah! I figured it went well for you the
last time. You're the only one who's done this

514
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,755
before.

515
00:35:36,755 --> 00:35:40,899
TRAVIS: Yeah, but there were these invisible
steps, right? I feel like we walked up some steps

516
00:35:40,899 --> 00:35:46,284
and then there was a portal. And she came out
first! It wasn't like I went to her apartment and

517
00:35:46,284 --> 00:35:48,406
I was like: Hey! Want to hook up?

518
00:35:48,406 --> 00:35:51,959
LAURA: Hey. Does this look like the pool you came
into on the other side?

519
00:35:51,959 --> 00:35:54,180
TRAVIS: Does this look like the pool I came into
on the other side?

520
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,777
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

521
00:35:56,777 --> 00:36:01,639
(laughter)

522
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:03,523
TRAVIS: 11.

523
00:36:03,523 --> 00:36:12,073
MATT: You were distracted for the brief time you
spent over here, but it does appear to be

524
00:36:12,073 --> 00:36:13,433
similar.

525
00:36:13,433 --> 00:36:14,991
TRAVIS: Similar?

526
00:36:14,991 --> 00:36:17,945
LAURA: Remember her name?

527
00:36:17,945 --> 00:36:24,634
TRAVIS: No! Did she have a name? Her name was
Nymph!

528
00:36:24,634 --> 00:36:28,248
SAM: Why don't you call out her name?

529
00:36:28,248 --> 00:36:33,603
TRAVIS: O Nymph! Where thee art thou?

530
00:36:33,603 --> 00:36:37,211
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

531
00:36:37,211 --> 00:36:44,449
TRAVIS: Oh shit! Seven.

532
00:36:44,449 --> 00:36:51,923
MATT: You watch as suddenly there's a burst of
bubbles under the surface of the water.

533
00:36:51,923 --> 00:37:00,568
LAURA: Scanlan! Whisper to Grog what to say to
draw a lady out. You're very charismatic. And

534
00:37:00,568 --> 00:37:02,878
repeat what you hear Scanlan say.

535
00:37:02,878 --> 00:37:05,284
TRAVIS: Okay. Well, you've got to come closer,
though.

536
00:37:05,284 --> 00:37:06,817
LAURA: Use your earring!

537
00:37:06,817 --> 00:37:09,127
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, we got earrings.

538
00:37:09,127 --> 00:37:11,773
MARISHA and ASHLEY: Cyrano de Bergerac!

539
00:37:11,773 --> 00:37:14,801
ASHLEY: Cyrano that shit.

540
00:37:14,801 --> 00:37:20,633
SAM: O Nymph! Hear my call!

541
00:37:20,633 --> 00:37:22,979
TRAVIS: O Nymph! Hear my ball!

542
00:37:22,979 --> 00:37:24,094
SAM: Nope, call.

543
00:37:24,094 --> 00:37:25,460
TRAVIS: Call!

544
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:29,917
SAM: Once, we spent an afternoon together.

545
00:37:29,917 --> 00:37:33,022
TRAVIS: Once, we spent an afternoon together.

546
00:37:33,022 --> 00:37:35,552
SAM: The sun never shone brighter.

547
00:37:35,552 --> 00:37:38,510
TRAVIS: The sun never shone brighter!

548
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:42,598
SAM: The clouds were never quite as fluffy.

549
00:37:42,598 --> 00:37:48,079
TRAVIS: The clouds were never quite as fluffy!

550
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:53,774
SAM: Oh, it would make me a man again to see you
once more.

551
00:37:53,774 --> 00:37:56,015
TRAVIS: Oh. That was too much.

552
00:37:56,015 --> 00:38:06,686
SAM and TRAVIS: Oh! It would make me a man again
to see you once more! I have a small dick.

553
00:38:06,686 --> 00:38:14,243
MATT: Another burst of bubbles comes up on the
surface as the water begins to break, and you can

554
00:38:14,243 --> 00:38:26,016
see a very beautiful, water-covered nude female
form that is laughing uproariously in the pool.

555
00:38:26,016 --> 00:38:30,002
(laughs) "Oh. It has been some time."

556
00:38:30,002 --> 00:38:31,827
(gasping)

557
00:38:31,827 --> 00:38:33,460
SAM: It's her!

558
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:37,394
MATT: And she takes her hair off to the side and
gets the water out of it and shoves it over her

559
00:38:37,394 --> 00:38:42,035
shoulder. She steps up, and this time her feet
touch the surface, and she walks on it like it's

560
00:38:42,035 --> 00:38:53,741
solid. As she begins to step carefully towards
you, "I apologize for being, well--" And she

561
00:38:53,741 --> 00:39:02,835
points over towards him. "I would recommend in the
future, perhaps, a more respectful means of arrival."

562
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,483
MARISHA: (stage whisper) Sorry!

563
00:39:05,483 --> 00:39:08,953
MATT: "If I recall, your name was Grog, is that
correct?"

564
00:39:08,953 --> 00:39:16,475
TRAVIS: That's right, my lady. Forgive me, your
beauty has wiped my mind. Your name was?

565
00:39:16,475 --> 00:39:17,944
MATT: "Nala."

566
00:39:17,944 --> 00:39:27,093
TRAVIS: Nala. I shan't forget again.

567
00:39:27,093 --> 00:39:36,752
MATT: "I watch over this glade. It is bound to me
as I am to it. I would hope that in the future

568
00:39:36,752 --> 00:39:41,027
"you'd be more gentle with that that resides
here."

569
00:39:41,027 --> 00:39:52,267
MARISHA: Sorry. I'm a huge fan is all. Hi. I'm
Keyleth, by the way. Of the Air Ashari--

570
00:39:52,267 --> 00:40:00,562
MATT: As you're talking at this moment, there's a
sudden sparking sound, like a heavy log has fallen

571
00:40:00,562 --> 00:40:06,432
in a forest with a crack and a thoom. There's a flash of light
and she instinctively turns and then dives beneath

572
00:40:06,432 --> 00:40:15,752
the water once more. As you guys glance over,
there's a somewhat shimmering form of light that

573
00:40:15,752 --> 00:40:24,128
congeals into a small gnomish female flickering in
and out. As Pike, after coming back from your

574
00:40:24,128 --> 00:40:31,635
goodbyes and walking to the temple of Pelor now
constructed to take at least a moment to begin

575
00:40:31,635 --> 00:40:38,338
building a bastion for Sarenrae worship here, as
well, you miss your friends so hard in that moment

576
00:40:38,338 --> 00:40:45,513
that, for a brief moment, the divine energies give
you one last brief moment to walk beside them

577
00:40:45,513 --> 00:40:47,211
across the planes.

578
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:52,445
LAURA: Pike! It's been five fucking minutes.

579
00:40:52,445 --> 00:40:58,563
ASHLEY: Don't we have a gatestone? I'm sorry! I
didn't want to stay.

580
00:40:58,563 --> 00:41:02,240
SAM: Is it because I owe you two gold?

581
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,464
ASHLEY: Yes!

582
00:41:03,464 --> 00:41:04,622
SAM: Okay, here it is!

583
00:41:04,622 --> 00:41:05,817
ASHLEY: Okay, bye!

584
00:41:05,817 --> 00:41:07,949
TRAVIS: Buddy!

585
00:41:07,949 --> 00:41:09,458
ASHLEY: Hi, buddy!

586
00:41:09,458 --> 00:41:11,837
TRAVIS: What the fuck did you just do?

587
00:41:11,837 --> 00:41:18,704
LAURA: You missed the naked chick! There's a naked
chick. She blinded Percival with her beauty.

588
00:41:18,704 --> 00:41:22,437
ASHLEY: Oh, wow. Well maybe we can take it. Where
is she?

589
00:41:22,437 --> 00:41:28,486
TRAVIS: Yeah, she went back underwater. Wait, do
me a favor. Look, maybe everybody take a knee and

590
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:31,522
be real chill while I throw down this swag, all
right?

591
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:33,182
ASHLEY: Sorry. Did I come in at a bad time?

592
00:41:33,182 --> 00:41:35,082
SAM: Well, you cockblocked Grog a little bit.

593
00:41:35,082 --> 00:41:36,289
ASHLEY: I'm sorry, Grog.

594
00:41:36,289 --> 00:41:38,791
TRAVIS: I was on fleek and now I'm on flock.

595
00:41:38,791 --> 00:41:48,951
ASHLEY: Oh no. Well, let's fix it. I had to come.
The Feywild, you know? I know we just said bye,

596
00:41:48,951 --> 00:41:51,421
but I had to come. All right, let's do this.

597
00:41:51,421 --> 00:41:53,763
LAURA: We all get down on a knee.

598
00:41:53,763 --> 00:42:01,180
TRAVIS: Nala, it is a friend, not a foe. She's
with me, and a great ally of ours.

599
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:07,398
MATT: With that, Nala steps back through the
water, taking invisible steps up to the top of the

600
00:42:07,398 --> 00:42:14,017
surface, where you're pretty much up to your waist
in the pool at this time. She's now standing

601
00:42:14,017 --> 00:42:20,396
directly on the surface about ten feet from you.
She looks out and looks towards you. "I remember

602
00:42:20,396 --> 00:42:21,727
"you, as well."

603
00:42:21,727 --> 00:42:28,970
ASHLEY: Hi. I remember you. (stammering) I didn't
mean to startle you. I didn't know everyone was in

604
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:30,290
the middle of something.

605
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:32,283
SAM: (whispering) She fucked her, too.

606
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:33,972
MATT: She met all of you guys.

607
00:42:33,972 --> 00:42:39,592
MARISHA: Oh right, for a hot second. But then she
took Grog--

608
00:42:39,592 --> 00:42:42,940
SAM: Of course we remember that thing that
happened when we were drunk two and a half years ago.

609
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:45,847
(laughter)

610
00:42:45,847 --> 00:42:52,032
ASHLEY: I do apologize again for startling you.

611
00:42:52,032 --> 00:42:56,760
MATT: "It's all right. Not many things happen in
this glade these days, so when they happen

612
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:04,646
"rapidly, it tends to drop my heart a bit. Speaking
of which, do you still carry my heart with you, Grog?"

613
00:43:04,646 --> 00:43:08,415
TRAVIS: As you know, my lady, of course I do.

614
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:16,871
MATT: She turns her head. "I don't sense it on
your person."

615
00:43:16,871 --> 00:43:36,012
TRAVIS: Oh! Right. An actual-- No, I don't. We
needed it for something. Yeah, so when last I saw

616
00:43:36,012 --> 00:43:43,832
you, I had this horrible bunk in my chest? It was
terrible. And in combination with your heart, I

617
00:43:43,832 --> 00:43:50,631
was able to remove it and prolong my life. Which
means I'm here.

618
00:43:50,631 --> 00:44:00,253
MATT: "Glad you're safe. I shall begin the process
of creating a new one, then. I'm glad it served you well."

619
00:44:00,253 --> 00:44:06,315
TRAVIS: It did, thank you. Many, many thanks. And
you have our apologies again for beheading one of

620
00:44:06,315 --> 00:44:11,198
your flowers and for making all the loud snapping
noises. This is not the way we wanted to start,

621
00:44:11,198 --> 00:44:12,416
believe me.

622
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:13,860
MATT: She puts her hand up and nods.

623
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:24,825
MARISHA: I Druidcraft a Tal'Dorei daisy and give
it back to-- I didn't mean to hurt your flowers.

624
00:44:24,825 --> 00:44:28,744
MATT: She nods and laughs. She brings her arm up
and as she does, a singular vine seems to grow up

625
00:44:28,744 --> 00:44:34,994
out of the muck and curl up, and take the daisy
from your finger and drag it off into the forest.

626
00:44:34,994 --> 00:44:36,747
MARISHA: Sorry.

627
00:44:36,747 --> 00:44:45,684
TRAVIS: If I might ask, old bleachy-hair over here
took a look at your beauty and all of a sudden

628
00:44:45,684 --> 00:44:47,669
went (raspberry) and can't see anything.

629
00:44:47,669 --> 00:44:51,775
MATT: "That's a hard lesson learned."

630
00:44:51,775 --> 00:44:57,255
MARISHA: Can you not get it back?

631
00:44:57,255 --> 00:44:58,505
TRAVIS: Nope, he's blind forever.

632
00:44:58,505 --> 00:45:01,723
MATT: "It doesn't work that way. I'm sorry."

633
00:45:01,723 --> 00:45:03,464
LAURA: How does it work?

634
00:45:03,464 --> 00:45:15,625
MATT: "For the most part, those that fall under my
protective gaze, they've earned it. Don't consider

635
00:45:15,625 --> 00:45:23,398
"past that. And my innate talents do not reach
beyond that striking, so I'm sorry."

636
00:45:23,398 --> 00:45:28,834
TRAVIS: Yeah, totally cool. We're going to put
some Braille on your gun.

637
00:45:28,834 --> 00:45:34,289
LAURA: I bet Pike has a few tricks up her sleeve.

638
00:45:34,289 --> 00:45:36,967
ASHLEY: I think I could give it a go, with some
things.

639
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:39,208
MARISHA: Do you have Regeneration on you today?

640
00:45:39,208 --> 00:45:40,904
ASHLEY: (quietly) Yeah.

641
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:43,946
TALIESIN: I think it's probably mystical.

642
00:45:43,946 --> 00:45:49,232
MARISHA: I could attempt a Dispel Magic first.

643
00:45:49,232 --> 00:45:54,425
SAM: Maybe you're just this way now, and your
other senses will get better.

644
00:45:54,425 --> 00:45:57,325
MARISHA: You could rock it for a while.

645
00:45:57,325 --> 00:46:00,645
TRAVIS: You said it's been very calm around here.

646
00:46:00,645 --> 00:46:02,081
MATT: "Yes."

647
00:46:02,081 --> 00:46:06,900
TRAVIS: No unexpected visitors or commotions
lately?

648
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:09,218
MATT: "Not around my glade, no. I'd know."

649
00:46:09,218 --> 00:46:12,664
TRAVIS: May I introduce to you Vex'halia?

650
00:46:12,664 --> 00:46:14,929
MATT: "We've met, yes."

651
00:46:14,929 --> 00:46:19,623
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's right. I forget. She's
seeking something in this place.

652
00:46:19,623 --> 00:46:28,780
LAURA: Yes, actually. We all are. Have you heard
tale of a sick tree? Something very cancerous on

653
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:30,133
the land.

654
00:46:30,133 --> 00:46:34,604
MATT: "There are trees that fall under various
states of corruption time and time again in the

655
00:46:34,604 --> 00:46:39,792
"Feywild. Light and darkness stands eternal here."

656
00:46:39,792 --> 00:46:42,966
LAURA: This one holds a bow at its heart.

657
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:46,126
MARISHA: It's located in a bog?

658
00:46:46,126 --> 00:46:48,849
LAURA: In a bog. Something about glass?

659
00:46:48,849 --> 00:46:54,356
MARISHA: Near the river of the Gilded Run?

660
00:46:54,356 --> 00:46:55,935
MATT: "The Shademirk Bog."

661
00:46:55,935 --> 00:46:58,107
MARISHA: The Shademirk Bog. That's the one!

662
00:46:58,107 --> 00:47:01,025
MAT: "That is roughly two days duskward from
here."

663
00:47:01,025 --> 00:47:04,883
SAM: Duskward? That's west.

664
00:47:04,883 --> 00:47:09,202
TALIESIN: Or what passes for west.

665
00:47:09,202 --> 00:47:12,778
LAURA: I just started a page on the Feywild and
now it's already-- there it is.

666
00:47:12,778 --> 00:47:15,869
TRAVIS: Nala, I'm sorry. I'm very simple. Is
duskward actually west?

667
00:47:15,869 --> 00:47:20,875
MATT: "Duskward is towards the dusk." She points.
As she puts her finger up, you can see the trees

668
00:47:20,875 --> 00:47:28,195
relax now and open up the sky above you, and you
can see the direction where most of the setting

669
00:47:28,195 --> 00:47:32,649
sunlight is being cast into the sky, and she
motions in that direction.

670
00:47:32,649 --> 00:47:35,271
TRAVIS: Are you controlling the way the trees
move?

671
00:47:35,271 --> 00:47:37,537
MATT: "This is my glade. We are one."

672
00:47:37,537 --> 00:47:40,524
TRAVIS: Yes. It's very impressive.

673
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:48,704
MARISHA: Man, can you teach people how to do that?
Because that's awesome.

674
00:47:48,704 --> 00:47:50,221
SAM: We'll be moving on before then.

675
00:47:50,221 --> 00:47:54,978
MARISHA: You know what? I'll talk to you later
about it.

676
00:47:54,978 --> 00:47:58,629
SAM: Have you heard anything of this bow or this
tree?

677
00:47:58,629 --> 00:48:09,228
MATT: "I have not. I stay here. This is my home,
and I am bound to it to not wander too far. What I

678
00:48:09,228 --> 00:48:14,962
"know of the Shademirk, I only know through
individuals who passed through and kept me up to

679
00:48:14,962 --> 00:48:19,963
"speed with things that may or may not be
transpiring in this landscape, but those meetings

680
00:48:19,963 --> 00:48:24,004
"are tens of years, if not more, between."

681
00:48:24,004 --> 00:48:25,499
LAURA: Wow.

682
00:48:25,499 --> 00:48:36,423
LIAM: I'm sorry. Have there been any significant
changes of late? Cities here that didn't exist but

683
00:48:36,423 --> 00:48:37,855
a while ago?

684
00:48:37,855 --> 00:48:49,232
MATT: "Not to my knowledge, no. My understanding
of realms beyond this wood and beyond this glade

685
00:48:49,232 --> 00:48:55,986
"are fairly limited beyond what I've been given by
passersby, and it's been not since you, Grog,

686
00:48:55,986 --> 00:48:59,655
"stepped through with me. I've not had another
cross my path."

687
00:48:59,655 --> 00:49:01,420
LAURA: Sounds lonely.

688
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:07,785
MATT: "It is my life. The trees keep me company.
The roots, they speak. The earth itself is

689
00:49:07,785 --> 00:49:14,615
"sustenance and the voice, the timeless voice of
this land-- well, there are many stories here."

690
00:49:14,615 --> 00:49:16,954
TRAVIS: She's so sweet.

691
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:19,338
MARISHA: I really like her, yeah.

692
00:49:19,338 --> 00:49:26,068
TRAVIS: As we make our way towards this area, is
there anything that you would warn us of?

693
00:49:26,068 --> 00:49:27,706
MATT: "Everything."

694
00:49:27,706 --> 00:49:30,568
TRAVIS: Oh. Everything.

695
00:49:30,568 --> 00:49:32,547
TALIESIN: Like don't pick the flowers.

696
00:49:32,547 --> 00:49:37,998
SAM: Is there anything specifically we should
avoid? Specific plants, colors?

697
00:49:37,998 --> 00:49:40,527
TRAVIS: Hands in the pocket policy going forward?

698
00:49:40,527 --> 00:49:47,550
MATT: "Gauge with care that which you tamper. Many
things lie and live in these lands that could be

699
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:55,687
"of aid and many, your own destruction. Words
spoken by many who live and call the Feywild their

700
00:49:55,687 --> 00:50:02,997
"home are in themselves riddles. Deceit is their
common form of time passage, and those that wander

701
00:50:02,997 --> 00:50:10,849
"from beyond, well, some would consider you more of a
toy or a plaything than a visitor or passerby."

702
00:50:10,849 --> 00:50:17,472
TRAVIS: Before we leave, is there anything we
might bring you on our way back through here,

703
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:19,524
should we be successful?

704
00:50:19,524 --> 00:50:25,122
MATT: (laughs) "Bring me some books."

705
00:50:25,122 --> 00:50:26,601
TRAVIS: Books?

706
00:50:26,601 --> 00:50:28,184
MATT: "I'd like some books."

707
00:50:28,184 --> 00:50:30,096
TRAVIS: My kind of books? Pictures?

708
00:50:30,096 --> 00:50:38,343
MATT: "Pictures are always nice, but things to
tell me of things beyond my sphere. Perhaps the

709
00:50:38,343 --> 00:50:41,921
"world you come from. Beyond the Frostweald, I know
very little, as well."

710
00:50:41,921 --> 00:50:47,398
LAURA: I have a book on me. Would you like it?

711
00:50:47,398 --> 00:50:52,903
MATT: "Take whatever you wish to say goodbye
with."

712
00:50:52,903 --> 00:50:59,010
LAURA: Well. I basically have it memorized at this
point, I've read it so many times.

713
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:04,062
MATT: She takes it and thumbs through.

714
00:51:04,062 --> 00:51:05,784
LAURA: That'll be 30 gold.

715
00:51:05,784 --> 00:51:07,501
(laughter)

716
00:51:07,501 --> 00:51:08,749
LIAM: 35.

717
00:51:08,749 --> 00:51:10,004
LAURA: 50 gold.

718
00:51:10,004 --> 00:51:12,110
TRAVIS: Markup's a bitch.

719
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:15,472
MATT: Closes it. "Thank you."

720
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:16,656
LAURA: Thank you.

721
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:27,684
SAM: Before we set out. You've told us what to be
wary of: everything. Is there anyone out there we

722
00:51:27,684 --> 00:51:29,751
can trust if come across them?

723
00:51:29,751 --> 00:51:40,271
MATT: "Depends on what you seek and what your
reasons are. Trust goes all ways. The difficulty

724
00:51:40,271 --> 00:51:47,771
"is finding who is aligned with your ideals, your
intentions, and your goals, and who isn't. I trust

725
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:52,315
"practically no one. Sorry."

726
00:51:52,315 --> 00:51:54,890
TALIESIN: I'm sorry, were you talking to me?

727
00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:56,441
SAM: She's talking to you.

728
00:51:56,441 --> 00:52:02,620
LAURA: What were those little colored lights that
disappear as we get close?

729
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:12,075
MATT: "Oh! Feyspecks. They are small entities that
care to the underbrush of the forests here.

730
00:52:12,075 --> 00:52:13,613
"They're not dangerous."

731
00:52:13,613 --> 00:52:15,841
LAURA: Do they lead you anywhere?

732
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:21,610
MATT: "I'm sure they lead you many places, though
none of them may be where you're trying to go. I

733
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:30,559
"wouldn't trust them to guide you. They themselves
are very deceptive and trickery-loving entities.

734
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:34,139
"But they help me keep the glade in the forest."

735
00:52:34,139 --> 00:52:47,658
LAURA: I was wondering if you have any sort of--
you're very well-versed with this area. Any form

736
00:52:47,658 --> 00:52:55,888
of protection you could offer us or recommend to
us as we move forward in this confusing land?

737
00:52:55,888 --> 00:52:58,046
LIAM: Any last bit of advice.

738
00:52:58,046 --> 00:52:59,958
MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

739
00:52:59,958 --> 00:53:10,046
LAURA: 26.

740
00:53:10,046 --> 00:53:21,292
MATT: She thinks for a moment, holding the tome
under her arm. "Well. I have minor magical

741
00:53:21,292 --> 00:53:28,652
"capabilities. Perhaps I could harden the
physicality of one of you, in a way to aid. It

742
00:53:28,652 --> 00:53:30,803
"won't last long, but it's something."

743
00:53:30,803 --> 00:53:35,199
MARISHA: Any assistance is more than greatly
appreciated.

744
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:37,091
LAURA: Maybe Grog?

745
00:53:37,091 --> 00:53:40,509
TRAVIS: No, I definitely don't need it. I'm good.
Who's all tender?

746
00:53:40,509 --> 00:53:44,294
SAM: Percy, at this point.

747
00:53:44,294 --> 00:53:45,673
LAURA: Oh. Well, that's true.

748
00:53:45,673 --> 00:53:51,768
SAM: How many of us can you embolden?

749
00:53:51,768 --> 00:53:57,859
TALIESIN: I'm a bit useless at the moment.

750
00:53:57,859 --> 00:54:03,084
SAM: No, don't sell yourself short. You're great.

751
00:54:03,084 --> 00:54:05,615
TALIESIN: You know I know what you're doing right
now?

752
00:54:05,615 --> 00:54:12,251
MATT: She steps forward, and as you're having this
conversation, she puts her fingers towards the

753
00:54:12,251 --> 00:54:17,676
front of your forehead and touches your skin. You
feel a surge of warmth through your body, though

754
00:54:17,676 --> 00:54:22,660
blackness still takes your vision. The rest of you
watch as his skin suddenly turns to a dark brown

755
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:30,361
and crackles. For a brief moment, you fear, but
notice it's like his physical form, all parts of

756
00:54:30,361 --> 00:54:35,133
the pinky flesh of the human Percy become hard
like tree bark.

757
00:54:35,133 --> 00:54:37,170
LAURA: Oh, that's attractive.

758
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:38,930
TRAVIS: You got wood.

759
00:54:38,930 --> 00:54:40,349
LAURA: How's it feel?

760
00:54:40,349 --> 00:54:41,875
MARISHA: I sniff Percy.

761
00:54:41,875 --> 00:54:43,167
MATT: It's like a fine cedar.

762
00:54:43,167 --> 00:54:46,650
MARISHA: It's nice. It suits you. It's very
masculine. It's a musk.

763
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:48,661
TALIESIN: Thank you. I'm still angry with you, but
thank you.

764
00:54:48,661 --> 00:54:50,146
SAM: Grog, carve your name in him.

765
00:54:50,146 --> 00:54:54,296
TRAVIS: Yes! Oh my god. Holy shit.

766
00:54:54,296 --> 00:55:04,777
TALIESIN: I put the pistol slowly in the direction
of his voice. My lady, I do appreciate your gift,

767
00:55:04,777 --> 00:55:11,385
and I do apologize for my friend and for startling
you earlier. It is my deepest regret that I cannot

768
00:55:11,385 --> 00:55:14,910
take in the majesty of your realm for the moment.

769
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:17,075
LAURA: (laughter) Of your realm.

770
00:55:17,075 --> 00:55:23,297
MATT: "Well. Keep your wits about you. That's the
finest defense you have against this uncertain

771
00:55:23,297 --> 00:55:24,800
"landscape."

772
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:30,222
TRAVIS: It was a true joy seeing you again. We'll
try to bring ourselves by this way on our way out

773
00:55:30,222 --> 00:55:31,650
as we can.

774
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:34,522
MATT: "I appreciate that. It is good to see your
faces, as brief as it is."

775
00:55:34,522 --> 00:55:37,123
TRAVIS: Well, wish us luck.

776
00:55:37,123 --> 00:55:40,707
MATT: "Good luck and safe travels."

777
00:55:40,707 --> 00:55:42,765
ASHLEY: Bye, Nala.

778
00:55:42,765 --> 00:55:45,350
MARISHA: As we walk away, I give Percy a wet
willie.

779
00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:49,047
TRAVIS: I bow to her before I leave.

780
00:55:49,047 --> 00:55:51,488
LAURA: Yeah, we do that, too.

781
00:55:51,488 --> 00:55:53,081
TALIESIN: Does she go for the wet willie?

782
00:55:53,081 --> 00:55:54,314
MARISHA: No, I give you a wet willie.

783
00:55:54,314 --> 00:55:57,544
TALIESIN: Are you trying to give me a wet willie?
I use missile snare.

784
00:55:57,544 --> 00:55:59,656
TRAVIS: (pointedly) I bow before we leave.

785
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:01,226
MARISHA: It's not a ranged attack.

786
00:56:01,226 --> 00:56:09,817
MATT: So you bow. She turns around and begins to
walk back down the invisible steps you see her

787
00:56:09,817 --> 00:56:14,106
taking, as she drifts deeper into the water, and
actually, before she disappears beneath the

788
00:56:14,106 --> 00:56:17,265
surface, looks over her shoulder and smiles at
you, Grog, and then disappears beneath the water

789
00:56:17,265 --> 00:56:18,291
below.

790
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:19,842
LAURA: Be honest. You totally (tongue click).

791
00:56:19,842 --> 00:56:20,931
TRAVIS: What?

792
00:56:20,931 --> 00:56:21,918
LAURA: Did you?

793
00:56:21,918 --> 00:56:24,675
TRAVIS: I what? What's wrong with your mouth?

794
00:56:24,675 --> 00:56:26,882
LAURA: Did you get it on with her?

795
00:56:26,882 --> 00:56:30,288
LIAM: Copulation, Grog. She means did you do the
thing.

796
00:56:30,288 --> 00:56:33,319
TRAVIS: Population? No. There's no population in
that. I think it's just her in that.

797
00:56:33,319 --> 00:56:35,452
LAURA: All right.

798
00:56:35,452 --> 00:56:39,072
LIAM: Did she like the beard, though?

799
00:56:39,072 --> 00:56:42,392
LAURA: Oh, that's right, you didn't have a beard
before!

800
00:56:42,392 --> 00:56:49,113
MATT: As you guys are having this conversation,
there's a brief sound as Percy, even amongst his

801
00:56:49,113 --> 00:56:52,442
blinded state, catches Keyleth's finger in
midair.

802
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:54,615
MARISHA: I still don't say that's a ranged
attack!

803
00:56:54,615 --> 00:57:03,715
TRAVIS: Gross. While the children play, I make my
way towards the dusk direction.

804
00:57:03,715 --> 00:57:06,531
LAURA: Toward the Shademirk.

805
00:57:06,531 --> 00:57:11,075
LIAM: Wait, hold on. I believe I was standing next
to Keyleth, so I stick my pinky into my mouth and

806
00:57:11,075 --> 00:57:12,931
I shove it into Percy's ear.

807
00:57:12,931 --> 00:57:15,982
MARISHA: Wet willie is happening!

808
00:57:15,982 --> 00:57:23,245
MATT: All right. Flanked by wet willies, Percy,
one is halted, but in the distracted moment and

809
00:57:23,245 --> 00:57:30,691
the stealthy rogue being what he is, you feel the
slimy insertion of a single half-elven digit into

810
00:57:30,691 --> 00:57:32,183
your ear canal.

811
00:57:32,183 --> 00:57:36,223
LIAM: And I say: Keyleth, that is really immature,
really. What is the matter with you? And I walk off.

812
00:57:36,223 --> 00:57:41,966
TALIESIN: Still angry at you.

813
00:57:41,966 --> 00:57:44,006
ASHLEY: We should fix you.

814
00:57:44,006 --> 00:57:50,375
MARISHA: Consider that payback.

815
00:57:50,375 --> 00:57:53,197
(laughter)

816
00:57:53,197 --> 00:58:00,055
TRAVIS: Is there any rocks or debris or little
pebbles around on the ground?

817
00:58:00,099 --> 00:58:02,894
MATT: Yeah. There's plenty of stone debris.

818
00:58:02,894 --> 00:58:06,646
TRAVIS: I'll take a small pebble. Pike, you really
should do what you can to help Percy.

819
00:58:06,646 --> 00:58:07,689
ASHLEY: All right.

820
00:58:07,689 --> 00:58:09,668
TRAVIS: And I toss the pebble at his face.

821
00:58:09,668 --> 00:58:10,999
(laughter)

822
00:58:10,999 --> 00:58:13,117
TALIESIN: Missile snare? With disadvantage?

823
00:58:13,117 --> 00:58:14,721
MATT: Make a perception check.

824
00:58:14,721 --> 00:58:15,960
TALIESIN: Okay.

825
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:18,576
MARISHA: See, that <i>is</i> a ranged attack.

826
00:58:18,576 --> 00:58:20,594
TALIESIN: 26.

827
00:58:20,594 --> 00:58:23,215
MATT: He catches the pebble out of the air.

828
00:58:23,215 --> 00:58:29,347
TALIESIN: My kung-fu is far stronger than yours.

829
00:58:29,347 --> 00:58:31,363
SAM: All right, Pike. Do your thing.

830
00:58:31,363 --> 00:58:33,534
LAURA: I don't know if he needs it.

831
00:58:33,534 --> 00:58:38,231
TALIESIN: I have dreamed about coming here since I
was a little child. I'm going to see this!

832
00:58:38,231 --> 00:58:39,700
ASHLEY: Okay.

833
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:43,996
LIAM: Wait, let's all think about this for a
moment. Don't do anything hasty.

834
00:58:44,041 --> 00:58:46,350
(stage whisper) Everybody, let's back up slowly.

835
00:58:46,350 --> 00:58:50,682
MATT: It gets really quiet suddenly, Percy.

836
00:58:50,682 --> 00:58:52,123
TALIESIN: I'm on a bear.

837
00:58:52,123 --> 00:58:58,423
MATT: Yes. Trinket stops and (bear noises).

838
00:58:58,423 --> 00:59:00,578
LAURA: (stage whisper) It's okay, Trinket.

839
00:59:00,578 --> 00:59:03,607
SAM: (stage whisper) Pike, if you do this thing
that you're going to do, will it take away his

840
00:59:03,607 --> 00:59:05,187
Barkskin, too?

841
00:59:05,187 --> 00:59:07,230
ASHLEY: I don't know. That's why I'm a little
nervous.

842
00:59:07,230 --> 00:59:09,709
LAURA: Well, you know. That's how it goes.

843
00:59:09,709 --> 00:59:12,116
MARISHA: You know, and to be fair, Barkskin, it's
all right.

844
00:59:12,116 --> 00:59:14,563
TRAVIS: Maybe it's temporary.

845
00:59:14,563 --> 00:59:16,521
MARISHA: Barkskin is temporary.

846
00:59:16,521 --> 00:59:18,081
TRAVIS: No, I mean the blind part.

847
00:59:18,081 --> 00:59:19,305
MARISHA: Oh, the blindness? I don't know.

848
00:59:19,305 --> 00:59:25,317
TALIESIN: You're all wearing your earrings. It's
dangerous as it is, but--

849
00:59:25,317 --> 00:59:31,532
LIAM: It's clearly hilarious, but Percival is our
sharpshooter. I don't know if we want him--

850
00:59:31,532 --> 00:59:35,125
LAURA: He is <i>one</i> of our sharpshooters, thank you
very much.

851
00:59:35,125 --> 00:59:37,893
LIAM: Well, why would we want one when we could
have two?

852
00:59:37,893 --> 00:59:39,363
TRAVIS: Let's try it, then.

853
00:59:39,363 --> 00:59:44,595
ASHLEY: Yeah, a blind sharpshooter might not be
the best in the Feywild. I would throw it out there.

854
00:59:44,595 --> 00:59:47,041
TALIESIN: Be a shame if your broom breaks.

855
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:52,415
LAURA: It really would. Hey, I want to heal you!
All right?

856
00:59:52,415 --> 00:59:57,856
MARISHA: Do you want to be healed or not, Percy?
Jeez, first you say you're mad at me and then you

857
00:59:57,856 --> 00:59:59,967
ensnare my melee wet willie--

858
00:59:59,967 --> 01:00:02,639
SAM: People! We're tearing ourselves apart in the
Feywild.

859
01:00:02,639 --> 01:00:07,192
TALIESIN: I'm just reminding the dear what side
her bread is buttered on.

860
01:00:07,192 --> 01:00:14,684
SAM: Let Pike get rid of this blind spot so we can
all be together again.

861
01:00:14,684 --> 01:00:17,347
TRAVIS: It's masterful.

862
01:00:17,347 --> 01:00:19,340
LAURA: How long has he been working on that?

863
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:22,902
TALIESIN: Wow. Okay.

864
01:00:22,902 --> 01:00:25,287
LIAM: Critical Role, where you come for high
fantasy.

865
01:00:25,287 --> 01:00:27,857
LAURA: Give it a go.

866
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:29,358
MARISHA: Wait. Percy.

867
01:00:29,358 --> 01:00:30,446
TALIESIN: What?

868
01:00:30,446 --> 01:00:38,007
MARISHA: Say you're not mad at me anymore. Say:
Hey, I know I've done things in the past to piss

869
01:00:38,007 --> 01:00:39,178
you off--

870
01:00:39,178 --> 01:00:41,116
LAURA: Trinket, come here!

871
01:00:41,116 --> 01:00:44,474
MATT: All of a sudden, Trinket lurches forward and
starts dragging him.

872
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:45,923
TALIESIN: Am I a reckless human?

873
01:00:45,923 --> 01:00:46,850
MARISHA: Yes.

874
01:00:46,850 --> 01:00:50,241
TALIESIN: So when I say you shouldn't probably
touch anything, there's probably a really good

875
01:00:50,241 --> 01:00:51,588
reason, right?

876
01:00:51,588 --> 01:00:58,269
MARISHA: Yeah. Are you going to hold this one
against me because I picked a flower, like how you

877
01:00:58,269 --> 01:01:00,532
held the Clasp against me?

878
01:01:00,532 --> 01:01:03,785
MATT: Trinket's been dragging him away from you,
towards her.

879
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:05,720
MARISHA: Hold against me like the Clasp?

880
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:08,283
SAM: Do you need inspiration, Pike?

881
01:01:08,283 --> 01:01:10,216
ASHLEY: No, I think it's okay.

882
01:01:10,216 --> 01:01:14,531
TALIESIN: I'll have my revenge, but I love you.

883
01:01:14,531 --> 01:01:15,937
MARISHA: It's okay.

884
01:01:15,937 --> 01:01:20,475
ASHLEY: Get my way up Trinket and cast Greater
Restoration.

885
01:01:20,475 --> 01:01:33,399
MATT: Okay. So as you clutch your holy symbol,
your flickering divine form drifts over towards

886
01:01:33,399 --> 01:01:37,299
the side of Trinket. You reach up and touch his
leg, and the warmth of the divine energy surges

887
01:01:37,299 --> 01:01:42,412
through his leg. You can see it almost like a
sparkle up his chest, little light rays peering

888
01:01:42,412 --> 01:01:46,470
out from beneath the clothing. It comes up his
gullet, up the side of his face, and his eyes

889
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:53,561
flash white, with beams of gentle sunlight
shooting out for a second. The darkness becomes

890
01:01:53,561 --> 01:01:58,278
blurry, and your vision over the next 15 or so
seconds returns to normal.

891
01:01:58,278 --> 01:01:59,450
TALIESIN: Oh!

892
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:00,765
ASHLEY: You see?

893
01:02:00,765 --> 01:02:03,341
TALIESIN: Yes, much better. Hi! It's so good to
see you.

894
01:02:03,341 --> 01:02:06,577
ASHLEY: Does he still have Barkskin?

895
01:02:06,577 --> 01:02:07,563
MATT: Yes.

896
01:02:07,563 --> 01:02:08,645
LAURA: Yay!

897
01:02:08,645 --> 01:02:11,378
MARISHA: I come up from behind and give him
another wet willie!

898
01:02:11,378 --> 01:02:12,678
TALIESIN: (yelps)

899
01:02:12,678 --> 01:02:16,143
MARISHA: See? I got you even when you had your
eyes.

900
01:02:16,143 --> 01:02:17,680
TALIESIN: I'll make you a deal.

901
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:19,297
MARISHA: All right, what?

902
01:02:19,297 --> 01:02:20,531
TALIESIN: Come here.

903
01:02:20,531 --> 01:02:21,985
MARISHA: What?

904
01:02:21,985 --> 01:02:29,087
LAURA: Can we start moving forward? Yeah, we leave
them.

905
01:02:29,087 --> 01:02:31,656
MARISHA: All right. We'll keep moving.

906
01:02:31,656 --> 01:02:36,285
MATT: You guys catch up with the rest of the
party, who's now moved on ahead. Making your way

907
01:02:36,285 --> 01:02:41,835
through this thick forest, I would like you all to
make a perception check.

908
01:02:41,835 --> 01:02:43,788
SAM: Perception check?

909
01:02:43,788 --> 01:02:45,426
LAURA: Perception check.

910
01:02:45,426 --> 01:02:52,913
TRAVIS: Nice. 19. Natural 19.

911
01:02:52,913 --> 01:02:54,668
LAURA: 27.

912
01:02:54,668 --> 01:02:56,130
TALIESIN: 11.

913
01:02:56,130 --> 01:02:57,379
MARISHA: 25.

914
01:02:57,379 --> 01:02:58,935
SAM: Oh, ten.

915
01:02:58,935 --> 01:03:00,385
ASHLEY: 14.

916
01:03:00,385 --> 01:03:02,079
MATT: What did you get, Liam?

917
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:03,270
LIAM: 24.

918
01:03:03,270 --> 01:03:12,816
MATT: 24. Okay. 25s or higher, which I think is
Keyleth and Vex. You guys push through the forest

919
01:03:12,816 --> 01:03:15,587
for about another two hours or so.

920
01:03:15,587 --> 01:03:22,521
MARISHA: While we do that, I take Percy's
Barkskin, and I regal it out. I give him moss

921
01:03:22,521 --> 01:03:31,546
epaulets, grow some flowers on it, give him a
little Whitestone flower crown. I'm making him a

922
01:03:31,546 --> 01:03:32,852
fancy tree.

923
01:03:32,852 --> 01:03:34,596
LIAM: A druidic Sergeant Pepper?

924
01:03:34,596 --> 01:03:36,436
TALIESIN: Now we're even. Good.

925
01:03:36,436 --> 01:03:41,123
MATT: All right. Two hours of travel towards the
direction of the dusk, keeping tabs on it the best

926
01:03:41,123 --> 01:03:48,943
you can, you being the tracker you are, you notice
that the night hasn't come. The light in the sky

927
01:03:48,943 --> 01:03:57,423
itself has not changed. The dusk hasn't waxed or
waned; there's been no change in the sky light or

928
01:03:57,423 --> 01:04:03,101
color whatsoever. The dusk seems to have for the
last couple hours been perpetual and unmoving.

929
01:04:03,101 --> 01:04:05,178
TALIESIN: Maybe we're in the dusklands.

930
01:04:05,178 --> 01:04:09,299
LAURA: I feel like I remember hearing that the
time here is very strange.

931
01:04:09,299 --> 01:04:12,341
MARISHA: It stays at a constant, correct?

932
01:04:12,341 --> 01:04:14,029
TALIESIN: Well, not necessarily.

933
01:04:14,029 --> 01:04:17,251
LAURA: Maybe it moves slower here. I don't know.

934
01:04:17,251 --> 01:04:21,553
MARISHA: We are moving towards dusk, correct?
We're moving towards the setting sun?

935
01:04:21,553 --> 01:04:24,244
MATT: You're moving towards that. That was the one
direction you were given by the nymph, yes.

936
01:04:24,244 --> 01:04:29,776
TALIESIN: It could be that we are either stuck in
a loop or that we simply in an area of the Feywild

937
01:04:29,776 --> 01:04:31,685
that is eternal dusk.

938
01:04:31,685 --> 01:04:33,834
LAURA: Does it feel like we're moving forward?

939
01:04:33,834 --> 01:04:35,566
MARISHA: She said it was two days' travel.

940
01:04:35,566 --> 01:04:37,963
SAM: Two dusks' travel.

941
01:04:37,963 --> 01:04:40,342
TALIESIN: So we have to pass a dusk, at least.

942
01:04:40,342 --> 01:04:42,082
SAM: That could be years.

943
01:04:42,082 --> 01:04:43,319
TALIESIN: It could.

944
01:04:43,319 --> 01:04:50,398
LAURA: Do you think it's safe if I fly up and look
at the sky?

945
01:04:50,398 --> 01:04:52,634
TALIESIN: No, but you might as well. Nothing's
safe.

946
01:04:52,634 --> 01:04:57,019
MARISHA: Do I see any birds or anything like that
in the sky? Any wildlife? Any critters?

947
01:04:57,019 --> 01:04:58,670
MATT: Make a perception check.

948
01:04:58,670 --> 01:05:00,141
ASHLEY: Any critters?

949
01:05:00,141 --> 01:05:02,238
LAURA and TALIESIN: Critters everywhere.

950
01:05:02,238 --> 01:05:07,747
MARISHA: Sorry, 21. Yes, 21.

951
01:05:07,747 --> 01:05:12,793
MATT: Yeah, okay. You glance up at the next
opening you have in the canopy, and you see

952
01:05:12,793 --> 01:05:19,050
occasionally a flock of birds go flying by. There
is definitely vibrant wildlife, and you've seen

953
01:05:19,050 --> 01:05:23,646
throughout the forest here skittering squirrels
and other creatures that live here, though

954
01:05:23,646 --> 01:05:29,009
themselves being skittish and running off as soon
as your footfalls begin to hit that portion of the

955
01:05:29,009 --> 01:05:36,121
forest. There is a very vibrant critter lifestyle
here within this part of the Feywild.

956
01:05:36,121 --> 01:05:43,039
LAURA: I'm going to try flying up. All right, I'm
going to try flying up above the canopy.

957
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:48,781
MATT: Okay. You come up above the canopy. Have to
maneuver around some of the larger branches, and

958
01:05:48,781 --> 01:05:56,454
these trees are tall. You probably get yourself a
hundred feet up before you finally break the

959
01:05:56,454 --> 01:06:05,016
canopy, and as you coast over the top you can see
now before you, this forest is vast. The majority

960
01:06:05,016 --> 01:06:09,534
of it behind you, and you can actually see what
appears to be the edge of the forest's line maybe

961
01:06:09,534 --> 01:06:17,614
about ten miles up, and past that you can see
rolling grass hills before a mountain

962
01:06:17,614 --> 01:06:24,491
line. You can see in the distance, a very far
distance-- make a perception check.

963
01:06:24,491 --> 01:06:30,529
LAURA: I'm assuming I'm not in the forest anymore,
right?

964
01:06:30,529 --> 01:06:34,899
MATT: This would be looking beyond the forest, so
yeah, it would not have advantage.

965
01:06:34,899 --> 01:06:36,867
LAURA: 17.

966
01:06:36,867 --> 01:06:43,940
MATT: 17. You see a faint glimmer of some kind.
Something that stands out, it's like a reflection

967
01:06:43,940 --> 01:06:50,553
or bead of light amongst the grass fields beyond
the forest. You're unable to really tell the

968
01:06:50,553 --> 01:06:55,492
distance, but it does stand out as it occasionally
flickers.

969
01:06:55,492 --> 01:06:59,343
LAURA: Flickering. Do I see any sign of a city?

970
01:06:59,343 --> 01:07:06,629
MATT: Not from this perspective, no. Mostly, it
looks natural from this view. Also, the clouds in

971
01:07:06,629 --> 01:07:13,415
the sky are slowly moving like normal clouds, and
you can see in the distance what appears to be a

972
01:07:13,415 --> 01:07:16,474
sun that has passed beyond the mountain range, but
there is no change in the light.

973
01:07:16,474 --> 01:07:17,835
LAURA: The sky looks the same?

974
01:07:17,835 --> 01:07:19,739
MATT: Same it was since the moment you arrived.

975
01:07:19,739 --> 01:07:28,625
LAURA: Well, at least we know we've made some
headway. I go back down. There's a tree line, at

976
01:07:28,625 --> 01:07:30,782
least. I think we should reach it soon.

977
01:07:30,782 --> 01:07:32,787
TALIESIN: And if we don't, then we know that
there's a problem.

978
01:07:32,787 --> 01:07:33,931
LAURA: Right.

979
01:07:33,931 --> 01:07:40,887
TALIESIN: And remember: in theory, from what
little I know, the prettier it is, the more

980
01:07:40,887 --> 01:07:46,301
dangerous it probably is, and the older it is, the
more dangerous it probably is.

981
01:07:46,301 --> 01:07:48,983
MARISHA: What, things get prettier as they get
older here? That's not fair.

982
01:07:48,983 --> 01:07:51,224
SAM: Just the men.

983
01:07:51,224 --> 01:07:52,532
MARISHA: Damn it.

984
01:07:52,532 --> 01:07:57,701
TRAVIS: All right, let's keep going, then.

985
01:07:57,701 --> 01:08:06,432
MATT: Okay. You guys push on for another three or
so hours--

986
01:08:06,432 --> 01:08:09,129
LAURA: We're not out of the tree line yet?

987
01:08:09,129 --> 01:08:16,981
MATT: At the pace you guys are walking, you just
begin to push outside of the trees. It was hard

988
01:08:16,981 --> 01:08:20,029
gauging the distance from that period of time;
that was the rough estimate based on the

989
01:08:20,029 --> 01:08:26,128
perception roll. You begin to watch the tree line
thin a bit. There's still many trees around you,

990
01:08:26,128 --> 01:08:30,718
but the density's beginning to scatter, and you're
beginning to see more and more light let through

991
01:08:30,718 --> 01:08:36,635
from the treetops, and the trees themselves are
not as tall as they were towards the central bulk

992
01:08:36,635 --> 01:08:50,614
of the forest. Vex, you do catch to your left side
something that sounds like at first a little hiss, but

993
01:08:50,614 --> 01:08:53,940
instead it comes to your ear as a chuckle.

994
01:08:53,940 --> 01:08:56,316
LAURA: Hello?

995
01:08:56,316 --> 01:08:57,880
TRAVIS: What?

996
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:00,652
ASHLEY: Did you hear something?

997
01:09:00,652 --> 01:09:02,329
LAURA: Is somebody there?

998
01:09:02,329 --> 01:09:04,195
MATT: Make a perception check.

999
01:09:04,195 --> 01:09:08,193
LAURA: Ooh! Natural 20.

1000
01:09:08,193 --> 01:09:14,342
MATT: Natural 20. You glance out of the corner of
your eye, and you see about four trees behind you

1001
01:09:14,342 --> 01:09:20,090
some outline of a shaded figure that darts behind
a tree.

1002
01:09:20,090 --> 01:09:26,795
LAURA: (stage whisper) Did anybody else see that?

1003
01:09:26,795 --> 01:09:28,369
ALL: What?

1004
01:09:28,369 --> 01:09:34,369
LAURA: Okay, cool. Did it look childlike or
adultlike?

1005
01:09:34,369 --> 01:09:36,532
MATT: In between.

1006
01:09:36,532 --> 01:09:38,446
LAURA: Oh. Okay.

1007
01:09:38,446 --> 01:09:40,813
LIAM: We got a problem here?

1008
01:09:40,813 --> 01:09:42,589
LAURA: Just be ready.

1009
01:09:42,589 --> 01:09:44,565
SAM: Which direction?

1010
01:09:44,565 --> 01:09:47,740
LAURA: Behind us. I saw you!

1011
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:50,324
MARISHA: Let's get back-to-back, shall we?

1012
01:09:50,324 --> 01:09:55,111
TALIESIN: I'm going to sit backwards on the bear
while we move forward.

1013
01:09:55,111 --> 01:09:58,803
MARISHA: I'm going to go back-to-back to the
twins.

1014
01:09:58,803 --> 01:10:00,769
LAURA: Did you want to say hello?

1015
01:10:00,769 --> 01:10:04,887
MATT: No response.

1016
01:10:04,887 --> 01:10:08,554
LAURA: All right. I guess we'll have fun over here
without you.

1017
01:10:08,554 --> 01:10:10,597
TRAVIS: Are you sure you really saw something?

1018
01:10:10,597 --> 01:10:12,420
LAURA: Laugh like I told a really funny joke.

1019
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:14,543
(forced laughter)

1020
01:10:14,543 --> 01:10:17,607
TRAVIS: You kill me. Oh man, who would want to
miss this?

1021
01:10:17,607 --> 01:10:21,349
SAM: I didn't know a nun could curse like that.

1022
01:10:21,349 --> 01:10:23,754
LAURA: So funny. Anything?

1023
01:10:23,754 --> 01:10:34,148
MATT: You guys continue making your way towards
the edge of the forest, and shortly after, the

1024
01:10:34,148 --> 01:10:41,729
tree line does come to an end. There are small
clusters of trees, but beyond that, you're now

1025
01:10:41,729 --> 01:10:49,402
opening this nearly-endless grassland, the grasses
themselves swaying with the breeze that is

1026
01:10:49,402 --> 01:10:54,058
starting to catch up. You can see the waves that
curl over these low hills, and this beautiful,

1027
01:10:54,058 --> 01:11:01,667
deep verdant green-emerald color that shifts and
cascades over and over and over.

1028
01:11:01,667 --> 01:11:09,381
As you begin to step into the grass, it's high.
It's chest-high to the half-elves. A little below

1029
01:11:09,381 --> 01:11:12,202
waist-high to you, and the gnomes are swimming
through grass, at this point.

1030
01:11:12,202 --> 01:11:14,168
TRAVIS: Hey, buddy.

1031
01:11:14,168 --> 01:11:15,970
ASHLEY: This is fun, though.

1032
01:11:15,970 --> 01:11:19,133
TRAVIS: Do you want to keep staying down there
doing the breaststroke?

1033
01:11:19,133 --> 01:11:21,809
ASHLEY: No. I'm done.

1034
01:11:21,809 --> 01:11:24,636
TALIESIN: It occurs to me, I don't actually have
to ride the bear anymore.

1035
01:11:24,636 --> 01:11:27,082
LAURA: That's true. Do you guys want to ride
Trinket and see?

1036
01:11:27,082 --> 01:11:28,935
SAM: No, thanks. I'll ride Grog.

1037
01:11:28,935 --> 01:11:30,322
TRAVIS: Yeah!

1038
01:11:30,322 --> 01:11:31,694
ASHLEY: I'll ride Trinket.

1039
01:11:31,694 --> 01:11:33,440
MATT: You hop on Trinket.

1040
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:39,175
LAURA: Do you still have Barkskin? Nice.

1041
01:11:39,175 --> 01:11:40,762
MARISHA: He looks good, too, right?

1042
01:11:40,762 --> 01:11:43,151
TALIESIN: She's done me up.

1043
01:11:43,151 --> 01:11:49,012
ASHLEY: I give Trinket a scratch where it makes
him go weird and start scratching his neck.

1044
01:11:49,012 --> 01:11:57,374
MATT: (bear noises) He reaches up and gives you a
lick, but it pseudo-passes through your form, and

1045
01:11:57,374 --> 01:12:00,277
Trinket looks really confused and tilts the bear
head to the side.

1046
01:12:00,277 --> 01:12:04,254
ASHLEY: Sorry, buddy.

1047
01:12:04,254 --> 01:12:12,203
LAURA: Oh! As we're walking, first question: do I
see any form of path through this grass?

1048
01:12:12,203 --> 01:12:21,833
MATT: It's open field. Directionless and before
you. There is still the dusk ahead of you. That's

1049
01:12:21,833 --> 01:12:29,166
the best directional point you have right
now, but there is no worn path. There is no road

1050
01:12:29,166 --> 01:12:35,320
or street. There are no signs of civilization. It
looks like an endless field.

1051
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:39,507
LIAM: I've played the original Legend of Zelda. I
know if we go up, left, down, left, we should get

1052
01:12:39,507 --> 01:12:40,808
out of this field.

1053
01:12:40,808 --> 01:12:42,598
MATT: Shoot the bush.

1054
01:12:42,598 --> 01:12:48,285
LAURA: The flicker of light I saw in the distance.
Are we going to intersect it in the direction that

1055
01:12:48,285 --> 01:12:49,918
we're going?

1056
01:12:49,918 --> 01:12:52,119
MATT: You will get near it.

1057
01:12:52,119 --> 01:12:57,418
LAURA: Okay, so I'll keep an eye in that direction
as we move forward, but I want to talk to you,

1058
01:12:57,418 --> 01:12:58,635
Keyleth.

1059
01:12:58,635 --> 01:13:00,049
MARISHA: Yeah?

1060
01:13:00,049 --> 01:13:06,720
LAURA: I've been trying to find out a way to talk
to Trinket like I know you can, right?

1061
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:08,003
MARISHA: Oh?

1062
01:13:08,003 --> 01:13:13,127
LAURA: I was wondering if maybe you could teach me
how to do that?

1063
01:13:13,127 --> 01:13:14,396
MARISHA: (gasps) Teach you?

1064
01:13:14,396 --> 01:13:15,600
LAURA: Do you think that's possible?

1065
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:16,942
MARISHA: I don't know! But I'd like to try.

1066
01:13:16,942 --> 01:13:17,880
LAURA: Okay!

1067
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:21,963
MARISHA: Yeah, that would be fun. Okay. Can I do
something like that?

1068
01:13:21,963 --> 01:13:27,891
LAURA: I have a spell slot available for Speak
With Animals that I never claimed that I want to learn.

1069
01:13:27,891 --> 01:13:32,919
MATT: You want to take it? Okay. As you guys begin
to walk through the field, you begin to reveal

1070
01:13:32,919 --> 01:13:38,107
some of the druidic secrets of animal
communication to Vex, and over the course of the

1071
01:13:38,107 --> 01:13:39,693
next hour of travel--

1072
01:13:39,693 --> 01:13:45,352
MARISHA: See, the thing is, you have to get the
accents right for each critter, or else they could

1073
01:13:45,352 --> 01:13:46,921
get a little offended.

1074
01:13:46,921 --> 01:13:48,826
TRAVIS: And you're the point of access.

1075
01:13:48,826 --> 01:13:52,193
MARISHA: Totally. I keep going.

1076
01:13:52,193 --> 01:13:56,982
MATT: She bestows upon you the elements of it.
It's less about vocality. It's about being able to

1077
01:13:56,982 --> 01:14:03,002
connect on an empathic and emotional level, where
creatures can speak to you less out of words and

1078
01:14:03,002 --> 01:14:10,564
more out of the idea of emotions and thoughts,
which our human minds-- or in some cases,

1079
01:14:10,564 --> 01:14:15,390
half-human minds-- accept as words. There is no
actual speech that they're talking, like,

1080
01:14:15,390 --> 01:14:16,663
"Hello, my dear!"

1081
01:14:16,663 --> 01:14:24,112
MARISHA: So one of the things that I like to do is
embody the animal, and that can get you in the

1082
01:14:24,112 --> 01:14:25,092
mindset.

1083
01:14:25,092 --> 01:14:27,125
LAURA: I will definitely keep that in mind.

1084
01:14:27,125 --> 01:14:30,902
MARISHA: Let's practice being Trinket together.

1085
01:14:30,902 --> 01:14:34,775
LAURA: I let her do that, and I'm going to keep
walking normally.

1086
01:14:34,775 --> 01:14:36,308
MATT: She does it for a while.

1087
01:14:36,308 --> 01:14:39,086
MARISHA: I go up to Grog. (sniffs, groans)

1088
01:14:39,086 --> 01:14:43,118
LAURA: I'm learning so much.

1089
01:14:43,118 --> 01:14:48,003
ASHLEY: I think we're all learning. This is so
great.

1090
01:14:48,003 --> 01:14:52,046
SAM: I wish Nala had cast Blindness on <i>me.</i>

1091
01:14:52,046 --> 01:14:55,410
(laughter)

1092
01:14:55,410 --> 01:15:00,416
LAURA: Can I walk up to Trinket and say: Hey,
buddy. Can you understand me?

1093
01:15:00,416 --> 01:15:02,094
MATT: Do you cast the spell?

1094
01:15:02,094 --> 01:15:03,321
LAURA: Yeah!

1095
01:15:03,321 --> 01:15:05,954
MATT: Trinket turns to you.

1096
01:15:05,954 --> 01:15:08,228
LAURA: Do you understand me?

1097
01:15:08,228 --> 01:15:09,058
MATT: "Yes."

1098
01:15:09,058 --> 01:15:12,820
LAURA: (screams) I hug him so hard! Oh my gosh!

1099
01:15:12,820 --> 01:15:17,035
MATT: You grab him. Trinket doesn't seem to
realize any sort of difference.

1100
01:15:17,035 --> 01:15:18,756
LAURA: Could you understand me all the time?

1101
01:15:18,756 --> 01:15:20,760
MATT: "Yes."

1102
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:23,546
LAURA: Oh, darling, but now I understand you, and
it's wonderful!

1103
01:15:23,546 --> 01:15:25,454
MATT: "Okay."

1104
01:15:25,454 --> 01:15:30,693
LAURA: Okay, quick question. Do you mind being in
my necklace, or does it bother you? What's it

1105
01:15:30,693 --> 01:15:32,979
like? Is it terrible? Because I don't want to do
it if you hate it.

1106
01:15:32,979 --> 01:15:36,961
MATT: "It's a little lonely."

1107
01:15:36,961 --> 01:15:38,753
ASHLEY: Oh no!

1108
01:15:38,753 --> 01:15:40,829
MATT: "I haven't been in there very long."

1109
01:15:40,829 --> 01:15:49,878
LAURA: No, you haven't. Okay. Well, that's good.
Well, I basically wanted to say that I love you so much.

1110
01:15:49,878 --> 01:15:51,810
MARISHA: I give her a thumbs up.

1111
01:15:51,810 --> 01:15:53,266
MATT: "I love you, too, Vex'ahlia."

1112
01:15:53,266 --> 01:15:55,765
LAURA: (sobbing) I start crying!

1113
01:15:55,765 --> 01:15:58,732
MATT: A big lick upside your face, and nudges his
head against you.

1114
01:15:58,732 --> 01:16:08,363
LAURA: Oh, this is the best spell ever! I can't
believe I didn't know it before! Trinket! Thanks,

1115
01:16:08,363 --> 01:16:10,013
Keyleth!

1116
01:16:10,013 --> 01:16:13,199
MARISHA: The accent's really good. You're doing a
good job. It's very good.

1117
01:16:13,199 --> 01:16:21,894
MATT: As Trinket nudges you, he says, "It's okay.
I can stay in there all you need."

1118
01:16:21,894 --> 01:16:23,626
LAURA: Thanks, buddy.

1119
01:16:23,626 --> 01:16:28,082
MATT: "I can watch you through there. I can see
you."

1120
01:16:28,082 --> 01:16:30,379
LAURA: You can? Wait, you can?

1121
01:16:30,379 --> 01:16:32,489
MATT: "Yes."

1122
01:16:32,489 --> 01:16:38,800
LAURA: Cool. It's like when your dog comes in the
room when you're peeing. It's a little awkward at

1123
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:43,158
first when you hear about it, but it's fine. It's
okay. I'm fine with it. Whatever.

1124
01:16:43,158 --> 01:16:46,847
MATT: Grog, you've actually been in there, so you
have an idea of what he's talking about.

1125
01:16:46,847 --> 01:16:50,093
LAURA: If you understood what he was saying, which
you don't!

1126
01:16:50,093 --> 01:16:51,769
MATT: Boom, what!

1127
01:16:51,769 --> 01:16:55,287
TALIESIN: I'm imagining the genie bottle.

1128
01:16:55,287 --> 01:17:01,802
LAURA: For a while, as long as my spell lasts, I
want to keep talking to Trinket and catch up on

1129
01:17:01,802 --> 01:17:02,994
old times.

1130
01:17:02,994 --> 01:17:10,771
MATT: You guys do, and he talks about how he hated
at the time, but has in hindsight enjoyed the

1131
01:17:10,771 --> 01:17:13,317
memory of the pie contest in Whitestone.

1132
01:17:13,317 --> 01:17:15,793
LAURA: Oh, right. That was so good, right?

1133
01:17:15,793 --> 01:17:19,187
ASHLEY: What about getting his hair done with
flowers and braids and bows?

1134
01:17:19,187 --> 01:17:23,520
MATT: He tells you that was fine, but you can tell
through the subtle bear undertones that he wasn't

1135
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:31,353
too happy about it. But everything has this tone
of basically whatever you need, and anything for

1136
01:17:31,353 --> 01:17:37,874
you. There is an undying loyalty and love from
Trinket that you've always felt, but now to hear

1137
01:17:37,874 --> 01:17:41,375
in language form is very moving.

1138
01:17:41,375 --> 01:17:50,083
LIAM: I'm watching quietly the whole time with a
smile at this bear that I've known as a cub

1139
01:17:50,083 --> 01:17:53,482
grunting with my sister grunting back, and it's
very touching.

1140
01:17:53,482 --> 01:17:57,842
LAURA: I love the Feywild.

1141
01:17:57,842 --> 01:18:01,352
TRAVIS: I think the whole thing is fucking weird.

1142
01:18:01,352 --> 01:18:04,120
MARISHA: Keyleth wipes away a little tear.

1143
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:09,123
ASHLEY: Same. I'm sitting on Trinket, wiping away
tears.

1144
01:18:09,123 --> 01:18:11,947
LAURA: We're walking.

1145
01:18:11,947 --> 01:18:14,827
TRAVIS: We've been walking this whole time.

1146
01:18:14,827 --> 01:18:18,703
MATT: You guys keep walking. And you keep
walking.

1147
01:18:18,703 --> 01:18:20,846
SAM: We still haven't hit that tree line?

1148
01:18:20,846 --> 01:18:26,961
MATT: You're past the tree line. You're in the
grass, but it's hard to really gauge, since you

1149
01:18:26,961 --> 01:18:29,899
have no sun in the sky and you don't have a
central timepiece of any kind.

1150
01:18:29,899 --> 01:18:31,363
LAURA: Do we feel tired?

1151
01:18:31,363 --> 01:18:36,521
TRAVIS: Well, hold on. Can I spin around and see
if the grass we've been trampling on is leaving a trail?

1152
01:18:36,521 --> 01:18:43,012
MATT: No. None. No trail. It's like you never
stepped through behind you. The grasses parted

1153
01:18:43,012 --> 01:18:47,283
where you walked through, and then, looking
behind, it's like you were dropped in the middle

1154
01:18:47,283 --> 01:18:48,274
of a field.

1155
01:18:48,274 --> 01:18:49,584
TRAVIS: Is anything following us?

1156
01:18:49,584 --> 01:18:51,100
MATT: Make a perception check.

1157
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:52,999
LAURA: There was that kid that we talked to.

1158
01:18:52,999 --> 01:18:54,452
ASHLEY: Good call.

1159
01:18:54,452 --> 01:18:57,161
TRAVIS: A deathly eight.

1160
01:18:57,161 --> 01:18:59,238
LAURA: There was a creature in the woods.

1161
01:18:59,238 --> 01:19:00,689
TALIESIN: That you saw?

1162
01:19:00,689 --> 01:19:01,797
LAURA: I saw it.

1163
01:19:01,797 --> 01:19:03,323
TRAVIS: Nothing. We're good!

1164
01:19:03,323 --> 01:19:04,791
ASHLEY: Can I perception check?

1165
01:19:04,791 --> 01:19:06,373
MATT: You can make a perception check, as well,
yeah.

1166
01:19:06,373 --> 01:19:13,354
TALIESIN: Vex, do you feel like getting a little
bit of a bird's-eye view really quickly, perhaps?

1167
01:19:13,354 --> 01:19:14,658
ASHLEY: 14.

1168
01:19:14,658 --> 01:19:17,981
MATT: Glancing about, a smooth grassline.

1169
01:19:17,981 --> 01:19:20,501
TRAVIS: We're clear. Team monster!

1170
01:19:20,501 --> 01:19:22,024
ASHLEY: No one's following us!

1171
01:19:22,024 --> 01:19:25,864
SAM: What about this? Keyleth, can't we move
through the trees?

1172
01:19:25,864 --> 01:19:28,297
TALIESIN: We can't. There's no trees.

1173
01:19:28,297 --> 01:19:29,929
SAM: Just grass?

1174
01:19:29,929 --> 01:19:33,496
MARISHA: I will turn around. How far away are we
from the treeline?

1175
01:19:33,496 --> 01:19:36,004
MATT: From where you guys left?

1176
01:19:36,004 --> 01:19:37,004
MARISHA: Yeah.

1177
01:19:37,004 --> 01:19:38,904
MATT: It's visible, but it's quite a ways away.

1178
01:19:38,904 --> 01:19:40,556
MARISHA: We have been moving away.

1179
01:19:40,556 --> 01:19:50,975
MATT: Yeah. It's the rolling fields and hills.
It's comparable to the width of the valley between

1180
01:19:50,975 --> 01:19:55,792
the Cliffkeep Mountains and the Stormcrest
Mountains on Tal'Dorei. It seems like such a vast

1181
01:19:55,792 --> 01:20:04,027
space, with no immediate scattered landmarks. In
your head, which is used to gauging your position

1182
01:20:04,027 --> 01:20:09,934
from small changes in the scenery, it's
mind-numbing. It feels like it's endless.

1183
01:20:09,934 --> 01:20:12,683
LAURA: We have food. We're on our way.

1184
01:20:12,683 --> 01:20:15,575
SAM: What if this is a week's journey? What if
this is two weeks' journey?

1185
01:20:15,575 --> 01:20:16,992
MARISHA: She said two days south.

1186
01:20:16,992 --> 01:20:21,098
SAM: She said two <i>dusks</i> south. What if this is a
month?

1187
01:20:21,098 --> 01:20:23,264
MATT: She said two days duskward.

1188
01:20:23,264 --> 01:20:26,110
LAURA: Two days duskward. See? Two days.

1189
01:20:26,110 --> 01:20:33,139
LIAM: Does that mean two days into dusk or two
days that last an eternity?

1190
01:20:33,139 --> 01:20:34,900
LAURA: Two days. It's two days.

1191
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:36,526
MATT: She said two days duskward.

1192
01:20:36,526 --> 01:20:38,291
TRAVIS: We're fine.

1193
01:20:38,291 --> 01:20:42,274
MARISHA: But you were saying she was using two
days in a way that we would understand?

1194
01:20:42,274 --> 01:20:44,979
LIAM: We don't know.

1195
01:20:44,979 --> 01:20:50,863
TALIESIN: I'm feeling pretty confident about this.
I'm not having a lot of stress about this.

1196
01:20:50,863 --> 01:20:53,232
TRAVIS: Let's keep grooving. Sun's up.

1197
01:20:53,232 --> 01:20:57,294
TALIESIN: Until it's time that we all think it's
time to take a rest, and we'll take a nap.

1198
01:20:57,294 --> 01:21:02,575
LAURA: Yeah. When we feel tired-- I do want to
make sure that nothing's following us on occasion,

1199
01:21:02,575 --> 01:21:04,296
and make sure that nothing is around.

1200
01:21:04,296 --> 01:21:05,629
TRAVIS: We checked it out. We're solid.

1201
01:21:05,629 --> 01:21:09,906
SAM: Should one of us circle back and make 
sure that no one's behind us?

1202
01:21:09,941 --> 01:21:11,597
LAURA: We'll get separated.

1203
01:21:11,597 --> 01:21:13,303
MARISHA: We'll never find each other again.

1204
01:21:13,303 --> 01:21:17,452
SAM: All right, then we're going to keep going,
and I'll keep reading my book on top of Grog.

1205
01:21:17,452 --> 01:21:21,224
MARISHA: Do we still see the flashing light in the
distance that she saw?

1206
01:21:21,224 --> 01:21:28,548
MATT: Only at times, because when you go below the
hills into these deep valleys, before you come to

1207
01:21:28,548 --> 01:21:34,010
the next hill line, it cuts off your perspective.
But as you get close, make another perception

1208
01:21:34,010 --> 01:21:36,927
check, Vex, as you're keeping an eye on the back
of Trinket.

1209
01:21:36,927 --> 01:21:40,750
LIAM: Wait, you said Vax. Do you mean Vax, or do
you mean Vex?

1210
01:21:40,750 --> 01:21:42,356
MATT: I said Vex.

1211
01:21:42,356 --> 01:21:43,937
LAURA: 18.

1212
01:21:43,937 --> 01:21:50,746
MATT: 18. The source of the glimmer is becoming
larger, but you can't make out any details. There

1213
01:21:50,746 --> 01:21:58,002
are actually a few glimmers, clustered. It's one
of those things where it's not perpetual. Every

1214
01:21:58,002 --> 01:22:01,716
now and then you see it.

1215
01:22:01,716 --> 01:22:04,048
LAURA: We are heading towards something. I'm not
sure what it is.

1216
01:22:04,048 --> 01:22:05,310
MARISHA: Is it erratic?

1217
01:22:05,310 --> 01:22:06,975
MATT: It seems erratic, yeah.

1218
01:22:06,975 --> 01:22:09,589
TRAVIS: Something's on fire.

1219
01:22:09,589 --> 01:22:10,963
TALIESIN: It's a party.

1220
01:22:10,963 --> 01:22:12,011
SAM: Press on?

1221
01:22:12,011 --> 01:22:13,031
TRAVIS: Yeah!

1222
01:22:13,031 --> 01:22:14,766
LAURA: What else are we going to do?

1223
01:22:14,766 --> 01:22:15,982
TRAVIS: Definitely nothing here.

1224
01:22:15,982 --> 01:22:18,204
TALIESIN: We press on until it's time to rest.

1225
01:22:18,204 --> 01:22:26,900
MATT: You push on for a few more hours, and trying
to think back how long you've been here, the time

1226
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:33,463
passes in a strange way to the point where you
have no way of understanding how much time has

1227
01:22:33,463 --> 01:22:39,772
gone by, but you're starting to get a little tired
like you would towards the end of a day's worth of

1228
01:22:39,772 --> 01:22:47,832
travel. You come up over a large hillside, and you
can see now, there's a base of a mountain range

1229
01:22:47,832 --> 01:22:54,199
that you can make out a little bit in the distance
that meets up where that flickering is. You can

1230
01:22:54,199 --> 01:23:03,765
see what appears to be now the source of the
flickering. There looks to be some sort of a

1231
01:23:03,765 --> 01:23:11,833
civilization. There are towers. There appears to
be a stone ring around it. It's hard to make out

1232
01:23:11,833 --> 01:23:15,968
the details from this distance, but it looks
fairly large. It's in the side of the mountain range.

1233
01:23:15,968 --> 01:23:18,734
TALIESIN: I say we camp here. I think it's a
lovely idea.

1234
01:23:18,734 --> 01:23:21,535
TRAVIS: What's around us? Grass fields, pretty
much?

1235
01:23:21,535 --> 01:23:23,598
MATT: Just grass fields.

1236
01:23:23,598 --> 01:23:24,891
TRAVIS: Far as you can see?

1237
01:23:24,891 --> 01:23:32,211
MATT: As far as you can see, and then the hill
line eventually gets so high in the distance where

1238
01:23:32,211 --> 01:23:36,299
you can't see past it. You see the mountain range
and whatever the source of this glimmer is, this

1239
01:23:36,299 --> 01:23:41,282
strange, city-like series of structures at the
base of that mountain range.

1240
01:23:41,282 --> 01:23:43,994
TRAVIS: Yeah. Let's set up shop, drop.

1241
01:23:43,994 --> 01:23:51,061
LAURA: Can I fly up on the broom and see if I can
see anything in the field around us or look for

1242
01:23:51,061 --> 01:23:52,749
any movement in the grass?

1243
01:23:52,749 --> 01:23:54,247
SAM: Don't forget your hat!

1244
01:23:54,247 --> 01:23:56,012
LAURA: I put my fucking hat on.

1245
01:23:56,012 --> 01:24:02,756
TALIESIN: It suits you. It's lovely. I'm going to
use my optics to try and sketch what I can of the

1246
01:24:02,756 --> 01:24:09,385
city for the moment and get a general idea of it,
sitting down and starting to get an idea of it.

1247
01:24:09,385 --> 01:24:13,596
LIAM: And does it look like anything from my
sister and my memory?

1248
01:24:13,596 --> 01:24:19,133
MATT: Go ahead and roll a perception check on your
end, as well, Vax.

1249
01:24:19,133 --> 01:24:21,172
LAURA: And me?

1250
01:24:21,172 --> 01:24:22,491
LIAM: 20.

1251
01:24:22,491 --> 01:24:27,403
MATT: As you're getting up, sure, go ahead and
make one, because you get a better view, as well.

1252
01:24:27,403 --> 01:24:32,328
LAURA: 25.

1253
01:24:32,328 --> 01:24:36,853
MATT: 25. Vax, it's hard at this distance to make
out much of the information, especially with the

1254
01:24:36,853 --> 01:24:42,108
grass being as high as it is, and the hill beyond
it. For the most part, the folks that can get a

1255
01:24:42,108 --> 01:24:46,826
clear bead are those that are above the grass line
and keeping a keen eye, which Vex is.

1256
01:24:46,826 --> 01:24:49,946
LAURA: Oh, whispers! Whispers!

1257
01:24:49,946 --> 01:24:53,636
ASHLEY: (singing) Whispers in the night!

1258
01:24:53,636 --> 01:25:02,911
SAM: This is the anticipation that you feel before
you open a Loot Crate! Not knowing what it could

1259
01:25:02,911 --> 01:25:09,095
be. Could it be good? Could it be bad? What you do
know is that it's $3 off if you use the code

1260
01:25:09,095 --> 01:25:10,337
criticalrole.

1261
01:25:10,337 --> 01:25:15,366
TALIESIN: Don't try and Super Saiyan me.

1262
01:25:15,366 --> 01:25:16,947
MARISHA: Amazing.

1263
01:25:16,947 --> 01:25:19,942
TALIESIN: Oh, not quite.

1264
01:25:19,942 --> 01:25:21,746
MARISHA: Almost. Wait, maybe the bigger one?

1265
01:25:21,746 --> 01:25:27,152
LAURA: He's been chewing on that, just so you
know. In addition to that, do I see anything in

1266
01:25:27,208 --> 01:25:28,926
the grass around us?

1267
01:25:28,926 --> 01:25:42,317
MATT: From what you can see... every now and then,
you see tiny little bits of movement in the grass,

1268
01:25:42,317 --> 01:25:50,470
maybe a quarter mile one way. You can see a
similar type winding shape in the grass a mile or

1269
01:25:50,470 --> 01:25:55,971
so the other way. It's even further out. There are
other things moving in the grass, but none of them

1270
01:25:55,971 --> 01:26:00,705
are breaking the grass surface. But they appear to
be singular, at least in the shifting of movement.

1271
01:26:00,705 --> 01:26:09,802
You do catch a smaller source of movement in the
grass, no more than 30 feet off from where the

1272
01:26:09,802 --> 01:26:11,864
rest of your party is currently walking.

1273
01:26:11,864 --> 01:26:16,411
LAURA: Can I fly down near it?

1274
01:26:16,411 --> 01:26:29,963
MATT: Yeah. You swoop down, and over view of that,
you can see what appears to be a small humanoid

1275
01:26:29,963 --> 01:26:38,946
that is curling through the grass line. Looks
human. Big, thick curled beard, very coarse dark

1276
01:26:38,946 --> 01:26:51,646
hair. A muscled torso; stocky, but strong. What
appears to be a light blue vest that's covering

1277
01:26:51,646 --> 01:26:56,366
the upper part of the torso, most of the buttons
missing, and the bottom of it tattered and worn.

1278
01:26:56,366 --> 01:27:03,352
The hindquarters themselves are fur and come into
cloven hooves, and you can see a small pair of

1279
01:27:03,352 --> 01:27:08,342
horns hooking off the back of the head. This
individual is skulking through the grass, carrying

1280
01:27:08,342 --> 01:27:16,051
a small book and a long quill, and he's
occasionally leaping up over the grass line,

1281
01:27:16,051 --> 01:27:18,127
landing, and then drawing something in the book.

1282
01:27:18,127 --> 01:27:19,767
LAURA: Does he see me?

1283
01:27:19,767 --> 01:27:22,924
MATT: He does not see you at the moment, no.
You're overhead.

1284
01:27:22,924 --> 01:27:28,738
LAURA: I want to float down above him on the broom
and lay down on the broom and say:

1285
01:27:28,738 --> 01:27:30,871
What are you drawing?

1286
01:27:30,871 --> 01:27:39,492
MATT: As soon as you come down and whisper, the
tome slams shut. The figure stands up straight,

1287
01:27:39,492 --> 01:27:50,106
slowly turns the eyes towards you, and you can see
the dark and ruddy skin, the sun-touched nose and

1288
01:27:50,106 --> 01:27:57,644
cheeks, a darker, more leathered texture to them,
but the eyes are piercing ice blue as he looks

1289
01:27:57,644 --> 01:27:59,526
back into yours. "Nothing."

1290
01:27:59,526 --> 01:28:00,791
LAURA: Nothing at all?

1291
01:28:00,791 --> 01:28:03,446
MATT: "Just taking notes."

1292
01:28:03,446 --> 01:28:06,793
LAURA: On those people up there?

1293
01:28:06,793 --> 01:28:08,264
MATT: "Yes."

1294
01:28:08,264 --> 01:28:09,807
LAURA: Oh. Interesting.

1295
01:28:09,807 --> 01:28:11,343
MATT: "Because why not?"

1296
01:28:11,343 --> 01:28:19,317
LAURA: Why not? You know, you probably could get a
better view of them if you were riding on this broom.

1297
01:28:19,317 --> 01:28:30,261
MATT: "You see, if you're worried, it's not me you
need to worry about. It's him." And points past

1298
01:28:30,261 --> 01:28:32,047
your shoulder.

1299
01:28:32,047 --> 01:28:37,911
LAURA: I'm not looking. I'm not falling for that!
Nope! Can I insight check him and see?

1300
01:28:37,911 --> 01:28:39,576
MATT: Make an insight check, yeah.

1301
01:28:39,576 --> 01:28:42,534
TALIESIN: I love this place.

1302
01:28:42,534 --> 01:28:46,669
LAURA: 16?

1303
01:28:46,669 --> 01:28:54,175
MATT: 16? He seems like a slippery person in
general, though he is caught off guard and right

1304
01:28:54,175 --> 01:28:59,755
now is in self-preservation mode. It's hard to
gauge if he's telling the truth or not.

1305
01:28:59,755 --> 01:29:03,071
LAURA: I'm not going to bite you.

1306
01:29:03,071 --> 01:29:10,002
MATT: "I don't-- I'm not a biter. I'm not the
biter in this area." And he starts backing up

1307
01:29:10,002 --> 01:29:11,144
towards the grass.

1308
01:29:11,144 --> 01:29:14,009
LAURA: Can I fly down and grab his wrist and fly
up?

1309
01:29:14,009 --> 01:29:20,521
MATT: You grab his wrist and fly up? (whimpers) I
need you to make a grapple check. Go ahead and

1310
01:29:20,521 --> 01:29:21,997
make an athletics.

1311
01:29:21,997 --> 01:29:23,432
LAURA: Oh, okay.

1312
01:29:23,432 --> 01:29:26,118
TRAVIS: I love it.

1313
01:29:26,118 --> 01:29:29,791
LAURA: Athletics? Oh, great. 15?

1314
01:29:29,791 --> 01:29:39,053
MATT: He pulls away, and as your hand grabs his
wrist, he attempts to slip his hand out. Fingers

1315
01:29:39,053 --> 01:29:44,539
pull through from your grasp as you double over
your other hand and grab him by the elbow. You

1316
01:29:44,539 --> 01:29:49,826
lift up and pull him out of the grass field, now
dangling his little feet in the middle of the air.

1317
01:29:49,826 --> 01:29:57,252
As he's being dragged up, the quill gets dropped,
and he looks for it, and the book's tumbling out

1318
01:29:57,252 --> 01:30:00,718
of his hand. He grabs the book and clutches it to
himself. "What are you doing?"

1319
01:30:00,718 --> 01:30:03,203
LAURA: Now I spin around and see if there's
anything behind me.

1320
01:30:03,203 --> 01:30:05,519
MATT: There is nothing visible in the vicinity.

1321
01:30:05,519 --> 01:30:07,585
LAURA: Sneaky little fuck!

1322
01:30:07,585 --> 01:30:14,197
MATT: "Please! This is really high!"

1323
01:30:14,197 --> 01:30:17,644
LAURA: It really is. I think we should go say hi
to my friends, don't you?

1324
01:30:17,644 --> 01:30:19,403
MATT: (whimpers)

1325
01:30:19,403 --> 01:30:24,882
LAURA: We're in need of company, dear. And we fly down.
Hello to everyone.

1326
01:30:24,882 --> 01:30:30,134
MATT: You drag him down, the broom coasting right
over the grass line, presenting you and your new

1327
01:30:30,134 --> 01:30:33,021
compatriot to the rest of Vox Machina.

1328
01:30:33,021 --> 01:30:35,859
LAURA: Well, look at this friend I just found!

1329
01:30:35,859 --> 01:30:38,468
MARISHA: Look at you!

1330
01:30:38,468 --> 01:30:41,812
MATT: Dangling from her grasp.

1331
01:30:41,812 --> 01:30:43,730
SAM: Grog, grab him!

1332
01:30:43,730 --> 01:30:46,001
LAURA: Gentle, Grog. Gentle.

1333
01:30:46,001 --> 01:30:51,058
MATT: "Hey, friend. You look like a smart fellow.
Let's have a conversation."

1334
01:30:51,058 --> 01:30:55,610
SAM: Don't talk to him.

1335
01:30:55,610 --> 01:30:57,798
TRAVIS: What is this?

1336
01:30:57,798 --> 01:30:59,349
LAURA: What are you?

1337
01:30:59,349 --> 01:31:00,946
TRAVIS: What are you?

1338
01:31:00,946 --> 01:31:12,042
MATT: "I am but a simple wanderer and an
individual who enjoys learning about things that

1339
01:31:12,042 --> 01:31:14,057
"are new and different."

1340
01:31:14,057 --> 01:31:15,054
SAM: Squeeze him.

1341
01:31:15,054 --> 01:31:17,007
LAURA: Don't squeeze him, Grog.

1342
01:31:17,007 --> 01:31:18,385
ASHLEY: What's your name?

1343
01:31:18,385 --> 01:31:20,094
MATT: "Garmelie."

1344
01:31:20,094 --> 01:31:21,466
ASHLEY: What was it?

1345
01:31:21,466 --> 01:31:22,702
MATT: "Garmelie."

1346
01:31:22,702 --> 01:31:24,498
ASHLEY: What are you reading?

1347
01:31:24,498 --> 01:31:26,668
MATT: "I'm--"

1348
01:31:26,668 --> 01:31:28,048
ASHLEY: What are you reading?

1349
01:31:28,048 --> 01:31:30,644
MATT: "Nothing! No reading!"

1350
01:31:30,644 --> 01:31:37,091
LAURA: No reading, just drawing. Percy! Our friend
Percival here, he likes to draw, as well.

1351
01:31:37,091 --> 01:31:39,212
TALIESIN: I do, quite a bit. Let's see your work.

1352
01:31:39,212 --> 01:31:40,611
MARISHA: Oh yeah, compare notes!

1353
01:31:40,611 --> 01:31:44,303
MATT: He tries to wiggle out of your grasp, but it
does nothing. You're concrete around him.

1354
01:31:44,303 --> 01:31:48,069
TRAVIS: With one of my fingers, can I give him a
little tickle?

1355
01:31:48,069 --> 01:31:49,928
MATT: (giggles) "No!"

1356
01:31:49,928 --> 01:31:55,046
TALIESIN: I'm going to very gently put my hand on
the book and take it.

1357
01:31:55,046 --> 01:32:03,681
MATT: It's a very finely bound book. The leather
is impeccable. It's oiled. There's a brass

1358
01:32:03,681 --> 01:32:11,960
metallic trim around the edges of it and the
binding. There is a thick piece of red velvet

1359
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:14,492
strip that is set as a bookmarker in the center of
it.

1360
01:32:14,492 --> 01:32:16,223
TALIESIN: May I?

1361
01:32:16,223 --> 01:32:18,082
MATT: (whimpers)

1362
01:32:18,082 --> 01:32:21,216
(laughter)

1363
01:32:21,216 --> 01:32:26,237
ASHLEY: That's the best face ever.

1364
01:32:26,237 --> 01:32:31,494
LAURA: Garmelie, I saw what you were drawing, and
it was quite lovely. Don't you want to share?

1365
01:32:31,494 --> 01:32:35,460
MARISHA: What's the matter? Are you scared?

1366
01:32:35,460 --> 01:32:40,843
LIAM: You might want to tell us what's going on
before we figure it out for ourselves. This is

1367
01:32:40,843 --> 01:32:42,031
your chance.

1368
01:32:42,031 --> 01:32:45,185
MATT: "There's really nothing going on. I was
curious and taking notes."

1369
01:32:45,185 --> 01:32:47,968
TALIESIN: I've been taking notes myself.

1370
01:32:47,968 --> 01:32:52,375
MARISHA: Yeah, you guys should compare notes.
Cross-references are always good.

1371
01:32:52,375 --> 01:32:54,186
MATT: "You wouldn't understand."

1372
01:32:54,186 --> 01:32:56,209
MARISHA: You could help us.

1373
01:32:56,209 --> 01:32:58,616
TALIESIN: Do we have that Hunk of-- not that
that's going to help here.

1374
01:32:58,616 --> 01:33:01,510
MARISHA: The Hunk of Quall? It's expired.

1375
01:33:01,510 --> 01:33:04,190
SAM: I'll step forward and put my hand on his
shoulder and say: Listen.

1376
01:33:04,190 --> 01:33:06,613
MATT: By the way, he's being held up by Grog right
now.

1377
01:33:06,613 --> 01:33:15,496
SAM: On his toe, then. I'll say: Listen, little
man. I'm little, too, and you have nothing to fear

1378
01:33:15,496 --> 01:33:23,765
from us as long as you cooperate. I will cast
Suggestion on him, and I will suggest that he

1379
01:33:23,765 --> 01:33:27,073
fully cooperate with us and tell us all he knows.

1380
01:33:27,073 --> 01:33:28,297
MATT: What's the DC?

1381
01:33:28,297 --> 01:33:31,172
SAM: Well, I didn't use the hand cone, did I? So
18.

1382
01:33:31,172 --> 01:33:34,046
MATT: Okay.

1383
01:33:34,046 --> 01:33:36,380
TALIESIN: Is the book safe to open?

1384
01:33:36,380 --> 01:33:43,185
MATT: As you, touching his leg and looking up at
him, there's that shimmer of purplish energy in

1385
01:33:43,185 --> 01:33:49,726
your eyes, and he gives you a look. "Right, no
worries. No problems whatsoever. Whatever you need."

1386
01:33:49,726 --> 01:33:52,593
MARISHA: Can I go find his feather quill that he
dropped?

1387
01:33:52,593 --> 01:33:57,130
MATT: You don't know about the quill. You know the
book that he had.

1388
01:33:57,130 --> 01:33:58,398
MARISHA: Okay.

1389
01:33:58,398 --> 01:34:03,352
SAM: Tell us. Can we open the book?

1390
01:34:03,352 --> 01:34:05,046
MATT: Do you want to try to open the book?

1391
01:34:05,046 --> 01:34:07,949
TALIESIN: I'm asking, is it safe to open? For me?

1392
01:34:07,949 --> 01:34:09,819
MATT: "Yes, it's quite safe."

1393
01:34:09,819 --> 01:34:15,412
TALIESIN: What's at the bookmark, may I ask? And I
slowly start to open it at the bookmark.

1394
01:34:15,412 --> 01:34:19,248
MATT: "It's where I'm currently making notes."

1395
01:34:19,248 --> 01:34:21,156
TRAVIS: Please be nudie pictures.

1396
01:34:21,156 --> 01:34:22,816
TALIESIN: I'm gently opening it.

1397
01:34:22,816 --> 01:34:35,025
MATT: All right. The picture you come to, as of
right now, is a very finely detailed sketch of

1398
01:34:35,025 --> 01:34:48,789
Grog. Very well drawn, but he has bulging eyes,
big buck teeth, and a very tiny penis.

1399
01:34:48,789 --> 01:34:53,455
(laughter)

1400
01:34:53,455 --> 01:34:55,241
TRAVIS: What do you see?

1401
01:34:55,241 --> 01:34:58,447
TALIESIN: He's brilliant. He captured everything.

1402
01:34:58,447 --> 01:35:01,178
TRAVIS: What's it a picture of?

1403
01:35:01,178 --> 01:35:04,846
SAM: He's a little shithead!

1404
01:35:04,846 --> 01:35:08,485
TRAVIS: Has he drawn us?

1405
01:35:08,485 --> 01:35:10,843
TALIESIN: I turn it.

1406
01:35:10,843 --> 01:35:15,305
SAM: Don't kill him, Grog!

1407
01:35:15,305 --> 01:35:17,994
LAURA: There's nothing wrong with drawing a funny
picture.

1408
01:35:17,994 --> 01:35:19,731
SAM: Art is subjective.

1409
01:35:19,731 --> 01:35:23,662
MARISHA: Oh man, he nailed you, Grog.

1410
01:35:23,662 --> 01:35:26,938
TRAVIS: What other goliath has been tromping
through this place?

1411
01:35:26,938 --> 01:35:31,956
MATT: "Many! So many. That's one of them."

1412
01:35:31,956 --> 01:35:34,706
TALIESIN: I'm going to start gently flipping
through some of the pages.

1413
01:35:34,706 --> 01:35:44,013
MATT: There are drawings of the entire party, but
with extremely exaggerated cartoonish parody

1414
01:35:44,013 --> 01:35:47,796
features. For Pike, her head is extremely large.

1415
01:35:47,796 --> 01:35:51,461
TALIESIN: Like Six Flags Magic Mountain caricature
vibe?

1416
01:35:51,461 --> 01:36:01,427
MATT: Yeah, with a hint of Mad Magazine. It's
essentially a book full of dickbutts. It's him

1417
01:36:01,427 --> 01:36:14,633
drawing and vandalizing the image of a number of
you guys. There's a picture of Vax and Keyleth

1418
01:36:14,671 --> 01:36:23,614
that are both covered in poo and slapping it on
their face. Written in Elvish, "I love this!" with

1419
01:36:23,614 --> 01:36:29,484
a word bubble. It's essentially a kid entertaining
himself with a bunch of stupid pictures.

1420
01:36:29,484 --> 01:36:34,529
TALIESIN: This is an awfully expensive book to be
this shitty in.

1421
01:36:34,529 --> 01:36:43,014
MARISHA: Is this just your hobby? Your pastime? Or
are you an actual records keeper for whatever town

1422
01:36:43,014 --> 01:36:45,147
this is? Because both would be humorous.

1423
01:36:45,147 --> 01:36:48,334
MATT: "No. No record keeper."

1424
01:36:48,334 --> 01:36:51,987
TALIESIN: I'm going much earlier in the book to
see what's there.

1425
01:36:51,987 --> 01:37:00,403
MATT: You start seeing a number of elven
individuals. You see people in really nice regal

1426
01:37:00,403 --> 01:37:08,433
armor, but all of them are pooping themselves.
There's a bunch of elvish ladies with oversized

1427
01:37:08,433 --> 01:37:18,032
floppy boobs smacking each other in the face. It's
truly childish. But they're really well drawn and

1428
01:37:18,032 --> 01:37:24,699
well shaded! There is a serious talent to the
artwork. His skewed intent of imagery is

1429
01:37:24,699 --> 01:37:25,931
fascinating.

1430
01:37:25,931 --> 01:37:29,857
LIAM: I'm in the mood to hear this guy's life
story. Get him a cup.

1431
01:37:29,857 --> 01:37:33,590
LAURA: I love them. Honestly, I think you're quite
talented.

1432
01:37:33,590 --> 01:37:36,622
SAM: Should we make camp here and invite him into
the mansion?

1433
01:37:36,622 --> 01:37:41,195
LIAM: As long as he's secure, yeah.

1434
01:37:41,195 --> 01:37:44,631
MARISHA: What's the name of this little town here
that we see?

1435
01:37:44,631 --> 01:37:53,630
MATT: "That! That is the elven city of Syngorn.
They've been here for a little while, and they've

1436
01:37:53,630 --> 01:37:56,989
"been a gracious source of subjects."

1437
01:37:56,989 --> 01:38:01,999
MARISHA: And where do you live when Syngorn's not
here?

1438
01:38:01,999 --> 01:38:06,860
MATT: "I live wherever I please. I choose my place
to rest."

1439
01:38:06,860 --> 01:38:11,827
LAURA: Where do your clothes come from? Where do
you live?

1440
01:38:11,827 --> 01:38:14,354
TRAVIS: Do you have any family? Friends?

1441
01:38:14,354 --> 01:38:18,128
MATT: "I've got family and friends all over, yes.
They're just a ways away."

1442
01:38:18,128 --> 01:38:21,939
LAURA: So you know this area quite well.

1443
01:38:21,939 --> 01:38:23,677
MATT: "I know it well, yes."

1444
01:38:23,677 --> 01:38:26,330
LAURA: So you could potentially guide us?

1445
01:38:26,330 --> 01:38:33,637
MATT: "It's hard to guide when you're being
crushed by a giant green-gray man thing."

1446
01:38:33,637 --> 01:38:36,551
TRAVIS: I'm just saying, is there anyone that
would miss you if you're gone?

1447
01:38:36,551 --> 01:38:37,730
LAURA: Grog!

1448
01:38:37,730 --> 01:38:38,652
TRAVIS: What?

1449
01:38:38,652 --> 01:38:40,213
LAURA: Be nice to our guest.

1450
01:38:40,213 --> 01:38:42,218
MARISHA: We're in the Feywild.

1451
01:38:42,218 --> 01:38:47,323
LAURA: I have a deal for you. We could offer
you--

1452
01:38:47,323 --> 01:38:50,086
TALIESIN: Dinner!

1453
01:38:50,086 --> 01:38:54,373
LAURA: Dinner! Delicious dinner. Chicken. Have you
ever had chicken? It's so wonderful.

1454
01:38:54,373 --> 01:38:56,230
MATT: "Chicken?"

1455
01:38:56,230 --> 01:38:58,157
MARISHA: Also a bath.

1456
01:38:58,157 --> 01:39:01,814
LAURA: If you happen to lead us where we want to
go.

1457
01:39:01,814 --> 01:39:04,568
MATT: "Where do you want to go?"

1458
01:39:04,568 --> 01:39:08,256
LAURA: We'll tell you in a little bit.

1459
01:39:08,256 --> 01:39:10,772
TRAVIS: Yeah. Crack out the door, homie.

1460
01:39:10,772 --> 01:39:12,316
SAM: All right.

1461
01:39:12,316 --> 01:39:18,861
TALIESIN: And to sweeten the offer, after you've
had dinner with us and we send you on your way,

1462
01:39:18,861 --> 01:39:23,623
perhaps we will consider giving you your book
back. Perhaps.

1463
01:39:23,623 --> 01:39:25,920
LAURA: I fly off, and I go grab the quill.

1464
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:32,225
MATT: Make a perception check. That quill fell in
the center of a tall grass field.

1465
01:39:32,225 --> 01:39:41,397
LAURA: I didn't even make it into the square. It
was pathetic. 27?

1466
01:39:41,397 --> 01:39:49,238
MATT: You spend the better part of the next 20
minutes realizing that there is no way you're

1467
01:39:49,238 --> 01:39:53,857
finding this quill amongst the grass. This is the
needle in a hay factory.

1468
01:39:53,857 --> 01:40:00,346
ASHLEY: Can I pat him down for any weapons?

1469
01:40:00,346 --> 01:40:02,465
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1470
01:40:02,465 --> 01:40:06,620
SAM: He's got seven dicks.

1471
01:40:06,620 --> 01:40:09,339
ASHLEY: Nine.

1472
01:40:09,339 --> 01:40:15,242
MATT: Best you can find throughout his body, the
only thing that catches your attention is a

1473
01:40:15,242 --> 01:40:25,120
now-crushed ocarina that he had on the inside of
his pocket that did not survive the grasping of Grog.

1474
01:40:25,120 --> 01:40:26,922
SAM: We can fix it for him.

1475
01:40:26,922 --> 01:40:29,316
ASHLEY: We can make you a new one somewhere.

1476
01:40:29,316 --> 01:40:31,969
TALIESIN: Give me the bits.

1477
01:40:31,969 --> 01:40:39,956
LIAM: Garmelie, we have a very bad track record
when we make friends. We have been burned badly a

1478
01:40:39,956 --> 01:40:45,433
few times, and I want to make it clear that you
will be watched while you're here. Come in, eat,

1479
01:40:45,433 --> 01:40:50,146
enjoy yourself, but multiple people here are
keeping an eye on you. Understand?

1480
01:40:50,146 --> 01:40:58,451
MATT: "I understand. Look, if we are to strike an
accord here, one of friendly trade of services, I

1481
01:40:58,451 --> 01:41:05,522
"would greatly appreciate it's done without this
very handsome, muscled-- "

1482
01:41:05,522 --> 01:41:07,231
TRAVIS: (sneezes) I sneeze right in his face.

1483
01:41:07,231 --> 01:41:16,254
MATT: You see it (drip) off his nose. "Without
this man trying to smash my innards, please."

1484
01:41:16,254 --> 01:41:17,897
LAURA: Grog, let him go.

1485
01:41:17,897 --> 01:41:19,739
SAM: Well, not go. Just put him down.

1486
01:41:19,739 --> 01:41:23,354
LAURA: Grog, put him down and put your hand on his
shoulder.

1487
01:41:23,354 --> 01:41:26,172
SAM: Are we making camp here? Should we get in the
house?

1488
01:41:26,172 --> 01:41:28,514
LAURA: Let's hold hands as we walk through the
door.

1489
01:41:28,514 --> 01:41:36,727
SAM: I'll cast the mansion. I'll sit down and
sing: (singing) My house is very, very, very fine

1490
01:41:36,727 --> 01:41:44,512
house! With chicken everywhere! Life used to be so
fair, but now it's better because of me!

1491
01:41:44,512 --> 01:41:47,774
(laughter)

1492
01:41:47,774 --> 01:41:53,067
MATT: As you finish the incantation, the
shimmering doorway of Scanlan's magnificent

1493
01:41:53,067 --> 01:41:58,988
mansion outlines within the grass field, only
emerging about a foot beyond the actual tallest

1494
01:41:58,988 --> 01:42:05,568
part of the grass. You have to bow down to get
into it. But you guys all enter, along with your

1495
01:42:05,568 --> 01:42:10,430
new friend, Garmelie, into the mansion itself.

1496
01:42:10,430 --> 01:42:16,313
We'll take a break there, and we'll jump back into
this crazed circumstance here in a few minutes.

1497
01:42:16,313 --> 01:42:23,834
We'll see you guys shortly.

1498
01:42:23,834 --> 01:54:20,399
[break]

1499
01:54:20,399 --> 01:54:26,042
MATT: Welcome back, everyone. A couple quick
things I forgot to mention at the top, as I guess

1500
01:54:26,042 --> 01:54:28,489
I can talk about it now. GenCon.

1501
01:54:28,489 --> 01:54:31,675
LAURA: Oh shit, we can talk about that?

1502
01:54:31,675 --> 01:54:40,193
MATT: I'm talking about it. They have a Critical
Role panel that they've announced in the thing

1503
01:54:40,193 --> 01:54:41,380
they put out--

1504
01:54:41,380 --> 01:54:42,506
SAM: Press release?

1505
01:54:42,506 --> 01:54:49,037
MATT: Yes, one of those. Emails, newsletters.
Thank you. Critical Role stuff happening. I will

1506
01:54:49,037 --> 01:54:55,345
be there all four days so panels and stuff coming
up. Cool. We'll have more info as that's unveiled.

1507
01:54:55,345 --> 01:55:01,631
But those of you going to GenCon, hopefully I'll
have some cool stuff ready for you then. That's

1508
01:55:01,631 --> 01:55:04,924
one mention. Also want to give another thanks
again to Loot Crate for being our awesome

1509
01:55:04,924 --> 01:55:06,023
sponsor!

1510
01:55:06,023 --> 01:55:07,872
(cheering)

1511
01:55:07,872 --> 01:55:13,319
MATT: Go to lootcrate.com/criticalrole and put in
the singular criticalrole word phrase to get your

1512
01:55:13,319 --> 01:55:19,624
$3 per month subscription discount. And we have
hit 20k subscribers, which is ridiculous!

1513
01:55:19,624 --> 01:55:21,942
(cheering)

1514
01:55:21,942 --> 01:55:26,540
MATT: I've just been notified that once we hit 25k
subscribers, that goal, whenever we reach that,

1515
01:55:26,540 --> 01:55:32,510
will be 25k and a talent show. I guess a lot of
the hosts and people involved with this show and

1516
01:55:32,510 --> 01:55:36,477
others have a lot of random weird-ass talents that
they want to reveal on the internet, because what

1517
01:55:36,539 --> 01:55:40,063
could possibly go wrong? So that's something to
look forward to. And we'll have other things

1518
01:55:40,063 --> 01:55:45,317
intermittently, giveaways and other goals, but
that's the next big goal that's been put out there

1519
01:55:45,317 --> 01:55:49,444
as far as I know, so I want to let you guys be
aware of that.

1520
01:55:49,444 --> 01:55:53,318
LAURA: My talent includes taming otters. I wish.

1521
01:55:53,318 --> 01:55:55,234
MATT: Is it the otter taming finger?

1522
01:55:55,234 --> 01:56:00,595
LAURA: No, that's my other stupid talent. But I
wanted an excuse to have an otter here.

1523
01:56:00,595 --> 01:56:02,466
TALIESIN: Shocking otters.

1524
01:56:02,466 --> 01:56:10,965
MARISHA: We missed the sloth, so if anyone wants
to bring out an otter, I'd be okay with that, too.

1525
01:56:10,965 --> 01:56:13,379
TRAVIS: You didn't miss anything. It moved super
fucking slow.

1526
01:56:13,379 --> 01:56:15,287
LAURA: Oh, it was magical.

1527
01:56:15,287 --> 01:56:16,938
ASHLEY: Maybe a baby panther.

1528
01:56:16,938 --> 01:56:20,460
MARISHA: That's so random, but I'm into it.

1529
01:56:20,460 --> 01:56:21,868
ASHLEY: I want one.

1530
01:56:21,868 --> 01:56:24,443
MATT: 22k and a red panda.

1531
01:56:24,443 --> 01:56:32,612
LAURA: 22k and a red panda! That's not official.
25k and a talent show, though, is real.

1532
01:56:32,612 --> 01:56:35,638
MARISHA: You're going to get an e-mail tomorrow
being like: Matt.

1533
01:56:35,638 --> 01:56:37,063
MATT: Unofficial!

1534
01:56:37,063 --> 01:56:39,362
ASHLEY: I don't want any zoo animals.

1535
01:56:39,362 --> 01:56:44,434
LAURA: I don't want any badly poached animals
taken from their environment.

1536
01:56:44,434 --> 01:56:46,509
MATT: Badly poached?

1537
01:56:46,509 --> 01:56:49,859
LAURA: I know, that was terrible.

1538
01:56:49,859 --> 01:56:52,623
SAM: I like a nicely poached animal.

1539
01:56:52,623 --> 01:57:00,401
MATT: There you go. Affectionately. All right,
guys, so back in the game. As you guys find your

1540
01:57:00,401 --> 01:57:09,640
way into the interior of Scanlan's magnificent
mansion, the individual, the fey creature known as

1541
01:57:09,640 --> 01:57:16,257
Garmelie, nervously walks along with you. What do
you wish to do before an evening's rest is taken?

1542
01:57:16,257 --> 01:57:19,667
TRAVIS: I stand at the door like a sentry.

1543
01:57:19,667 --> 01:57:24,409
TALIESIN: Let's have some food. Let's put two
guards on him.

1544
01:57:24,409 --> 01:57:26,141
SAM: I put 20 guards on him.

1545
01:57:26,141 --> 01:57:28,071
TALIESIN: 20 guards? That's a lot of guards.

1546
01:57:28,071 --> 01:57:31,640
MATT: A bunch of the servants (whoosh) shimmer out
next to him and he's like (nervous whimper).

1547
01:57:31,640 --> 01:57:33,059
"Hello."

1548
01:57:33,059 --> 01:57:35,778
MARISHA: Guys, let's have a carpet picnic tonight.
Can we have a carpet picnic?

1549
01:57:35,778 --> 01:57:37,621
LAURA: Is there a carpet here?

1550
01:57:37,621 --> 01:57:41,771
SAM: Yeah, there's carpet, but we have beds.

1551
01:57:41,771 --> 01:57:45,997
LAURA: Just a picnic?

1552
01:57:45,997 --> 01:57:50,232
MARISHA: Because we're in the Feywild. It seems
appropriate.

1553
01:57:50,232 --> 01:57:52,177
TRAVIS: We're not in the Feywild. We're in the
house.

1554
01:57:52,177 --> 01:57:54,231
TALIESIN: There's tables.

1555
01:57:54,231 --> 01:57:56,693
MARISHA: I just thought it would be fun.

1556
01:57:56,693 --> 01:57:58,502
LAURA: I would have a picnic with you, darling.

1557
01:57:58,502 --> 01:58:04,438
MARISHA: Thank you! I sit down next to the satyr
and I stare at him like this, a little bit.

1558
01:58:04,438 --> 01:58:05,793
MATT: "Hi."

1559
01:58:05,793 --> 01:58:09,869
SAM: What do we want to know from this little
twerp?

1560
01:58:09,869 --> 01:58:16,465
LAURA: Why don't we eat, and we'll get to the
questions in a little bit? Let's give him a rest.

1561
01:58:16,465 --> 01:58:18,949
I shocked him when I abducted him.

1562
01:58:18,949 --> 01:58:22,202
MARISHA: Do you shed?

1563
01:58:22,202 --> 01:58:26,526
MATT: "A little."

1564
01:58:26,526 --> 01:58:29,666
MARISHA: Do you grow a thicker coat during
wintertime?

1565
01:58:29,666 --> 01:58:34,494
MATT: "Winter-- seasons-- It's not really a thing
here."

1566
01:58:34,494 --> 01:58:36,928
MARISHA: Do you grow horns?

1567
01:58:36,928 --> 01:58:38,681
MATT: "They grew."

1568
01:58:38,681 --> 01:58:40,347
MARISHA: That's awesome.

1569
01:58:40,347 --> 01:58:42,093
TRAVIS: Would you care for any ale?

1570
01:58:42,093 --> 01:58:43,880
MATT: "Yes, please."

1571
01:58:43,880 --> 01:58:46,496
TRAVIS: All right. I crack out the big-ass cask of
ale.

1572
01:58:46,496 --> 01:58:48,414
LAURA: I would like some of that, as well, Grog.

1573
01:58:48,414 --> 01:58:50,180
LIAM: Pass it around.

1574
01:58:50,180 --> 01:58:55,889
MATT: You pass the ale around. He skulls it.
(gulps)

1575
01:58:55,889 --> 01:58:58,484
TRAVIS: Well, all right, Tiny Toons. Nicely done.

1576
01:58:58,484 --> 01:59:12,093
LAURA: Can I pull Vax aside for a moment and ask:
Do you want to go to Syngorn? We could avoid it.

1577
01:59:12,093 --> 01:59:24,542
LIAM: Well, we know no one here except for this
guy. We need to find you that bow. I don't relish

1578
01:59:24,542 --> 01:59:32,308
the idea of dealing with our father, but it seems
like our best bet.

1579
01:59:32,308 --> 01:59:37,168
LAURA: Right. Of course. We should go see them.

1580
01:59:37,168 --> 01:59:40,818
LIAM: Are you sure you want to, though?

1581
01:59:40,818 --> 01:59:46,650
LAURA: Of course, why wouldn't I? Please. And I
walk back to the group.

1582
01:59:46,650 --> 01:59:49,420
TRAVIS: I give the satyr another drink.

1583
01:59:49,420 --> 01:59:51,737
MATT: He greedily drinks it down.

1584
01:59:51,737 --> 01:59:54,611
MARISHA: Can I pet your fur? Is it coarse?

1585
01:59:54,611 --> 01:59:55,805
TRAVIS: Keyleth!

1586
01:59:55,805 --> 01:59:57,300
LAURA: Keyleth, that's a bit forward.

1587
01:59:57,300 --> 01:59:59,104
TRAVIS: You're so touchy today.

1588
01:59:59,104 --> 02:00:01,883
TALIESIN: I understand.

1589
02:00:01,883 --> 02:00:09,642
MATT: "So. If we're here to talk and make this
deal we're discussing, what is it you want from me?"

1590
02:00:09,642 --> 02:00:11,284
TRAVIS: Is he looking any more drunk?

1591
02:00:11,284 --> 02:00:13,736
MATT: A slight slur.

1592
02:00:13,736 --> 02:00:22,802
LAURA: Can I have some more ale, as well, Grog?
Keep it coming, all around.

1593
02:00:22,802 --> 02:00:24,310
TRAVIS: Yeah, fine.

1594
02:00:24,310 --> 02:00:32,984
TALIESIN: Honest opinion, what is the disposition
of the people in that city over on the hill? You

1595
02:00:32,984 --> 02:00:39,520
can be frank. We're not from around here. You
can't offend us with your opinion of them.

1596
02:00:39,520 --> 02:00:45,691
MATT: "It's a busy place right now. We haven't
seen the city of Syngorn in close to a hundred

1597
02:00:45,691 --> 02:00:51,857
"years, at the very least, and they have an entire
army building up right now. It's hustle and bustle."

1598
02:00:51,857 --> 02:00:55,111
TALIESIN: They have an army building up? Why is
that?

1599
02:00:55,111 --> 02:01:02,126
MATT: "Hell if I know. I just wandered through and
used that distraction to acquire a few things and

1600
02:01:02,126 --> 02:01:04,631
"make some fantastic notes."

1601
02:01:04,631 --> 02:01:06,313
LAURA: Acquire what?

1602
02:01:06,313 --> 02:01:07,924
MATT: "Things."

1603
02:01:07,924 --> 02:01:10,164
LAURA: Do you steal, darling?

1604
02:01:10,164 --> 02:01:13,654
MATT: "I don't steal. I borrow indefinitely."

1605
02:01:13,654 --> 02:01:21,322
TALIESIN: You just pinch small things, though,
like little gold trinkets. This is not really a

1606
02:01:21,322 --> 02:01:23,178
talent of yours, is it?

1607
02:01:23,178 --> 02:01:26,183
LIAM: Are we talking klepto stealing, or career?

1608
02:01:26,183 --> 02:01:34,330
MATT: "I take things that look nice that I think I
would want."

1609
02:01:34,330 --> 02:01:38,563
MARISHA: Where do you steal these things? Are you
a pickpocket?

1610
02:01:38,563 --> 02:01:50,464
MATT: "I am no simple street thief. I am a
procurer of wayward items and objects that need a

1611
02:01:50,464 --> 02:01:51,684
"better home."

1612
02:01:51,684 --> 02:01:55,968
TRAVIS: I think you should know that this door
that you walked through in this big house, if you

1613
02:01:55,968 --> 02:02:00,156
steal anything, it shreds you into ribbons when
you leave.

1614
02:02:00,156 --> 02:02:03,101
MATT: Make a deception check.

1615
02:02:03,101 --> 02:02:06,357
TRAVIS: Fuck. Six.

1616
02:02:06,357 --> 02:02:10,163
MATT: "Oh, I'm sure it does, big man."

1617
02:02:10,163 --> 02:02:13,965
ASHLEY: Well, it'll disappear if you take it.

1618
02:02:13,965 --> 02:02:15,871
LAURA: It certainly will.

1619
02:02:15,871 --> 02:02:17,899
MATT: "Well, good to know."

1620
02:02:17,899 --> 02:02:20,670
LIAM: Chicken in your belly goes, though.

1621
02:02:20,670 --> 02:02:27,283
MATT: "Look, I'm not going to take anything from
you. You've already proven far more of a match for

1622
02:02:27,283 --> 02:02:37,518
"me than I had ever anticipated, and what was meant
to be a simple, fun game of follow and-- follow

1623
02:02:37,518 --> 02:02:42,128
"has turned into a much more complicated
circumstance, so I'd like to get it over with as

1624
02:02:42,128 --> 02:02:43,405
"soon as possible."

1625
02:02:43,405 --> 02:02:46,827
MARISHA: Are you not having fun? We want you to at
least enjoy yourself.

1626
02:02:46,827 --> 02:02:50,536
MATT: "My quill is gone! You've threatened me and
my life!"

1627
02:02:50,536 --> 02:02:54,454
LAURA: I searched for it! Was it a special quill?

1628
02:02:54,454 --> 02:02:57,399
MATT: "It had sentimental value. I can get
another."

1629
02:02:57,399 --> 02:02:59,839
LAURA: I'm sorry.

1630
02:02:59,839 --> 02:03:02,140
MATT: "What do you want from me?"

1631
02:03:02,140 --> 02:03:07,312
SAM: We want you to take us to this place, this
mirk place.

1632
02:03:07,312 --> 02:03:09,318
LAURA: The Shademirk.

1633
02:03:09,318 --> 02:03:14,453
MATT: "You want to go to the Shademirk? Whatever
for? Why would you go to the Shademirk?"

1634
02:03:14,453 --> 02:03:16,215
LAURA: There's a very scary tree there.

1635
02:03:16,215 --> 02:03:18,451
MATT: "Yes. Why?"

1636
02:03:18,451 --> 02:03:21,913
LAURA: What do you know about the Shademirk?

1637
02:03:21,913 --> 02:03:27,806
MATT: "To stay the hell out of it, certainly. Want
to go to the Shademirk? Be my guest!"

1638
02:03:27,806 --> 02:03:30,040
LIAM: A little more than that, friend. A little
more.

1639
02:03:30,040 --> 02:03:32,338
TRAVIS: Your glass is looking empty.

1640
02:03:32,338 --> 02:03:36,133
MARISHA: You must know something, or else you
wouldn't stay out of it.

1641
02:03:36,133 --> 02:03:45,847
MATT: He takes it from you. He sloshes it around
and makes wild gestures. "It's a dangerous place.

1642
02:03:45,847 --> 02:03:55,634
"It's been a source of vileness and ichor here in
the Feywild for hundreds of years. It's a

1643
02:03:55,634 --> 02:04:02,158
"terrible, horrible cesspool of nothing. I'm so
sorry, this is getting everywhere."

1644
02:04:02,158 --> 02:04:07,857
SAM: Don't worry, the servants will get it. It's
terrible because of what dwells there, or because

1645
02:04:07,857 --> 02:04:09,551
of the place itself?

1646
02:04:09,551 --> 02:04:10,929
MATT: "Both! All of it!"

1647
02:04:10,929 --> 02:04:12,347
SAM: What dwells there?

1648
02:04:12,347 --> 02:04:15,598
MATT: "Creatures, things, trollish slime
creatures."

1649
02:04:15,598 --> 02:04:19,728
LAURA: Do you have drawings? Have you drawn things
from there?

1650
02:04:19,728 --> 02:04:23,779
MATT: "I sketched a thing or two."

1651
02:04:23,779 --> 02:04:25,426
SAM: Which page?

1652
02:04:25,426 --> 02:04:27,054
TALIESIN: Flip, flip, flip.

1653
02:04:27,054 --> 02:04:32,500
MATT: You take a moment to scan through, and there
are all sorts of creatures, all drawn stupidly,

1654
02:04:32,500 --> 02:04:44,298
many with extra private parts coming out of
shoulders and stuff. "Around page 163, 164." And

1655
02:04:44,298 --> 02:04:52,716
you see, and there are creatures all throughout,
but at that page in particular, you see a lanky,

1656
02:04:52,716 --> 02:05:04,797
tall humanoid that is oozing black, thick, viscous
tar. It's shaded in a way where it looks like it

1657
02:05:04,797 --> 02:05:14,284
has that glaze that only thick, oil-like
substances really give off. And it's dragging this

1658
02:05:14,284 --> 02:05:21,581
absolutely unnecessarily large dong behind it
about four feet. Every picture looks pretty good

1659
02:05:21,581 --> 02:05:23,775
to a point, and then you're like, "aw, really?"

1660
02:05:23,775 --> 02:05:28,509
LAURA: Garmelie, that creature. Is it very large?

1661
02:05:28,509 --> 02:05:31,314
MATT: "It's a little bigger than you."

1662
02:05:31,314 --> 02:05:32,716
LAURA: Oh shit.

1663
02:05:32,716 --> 02:05:34,921
MATT: Gestures and takes his drink back.

1664
02:05:34,921 --> 02:05:37,363
MARISHA: Does it have a name? What's this called?

1665
02:05:37,363 --> 02:05:39,519
MATT: "I haven't gotten close enough to it."

1666
02:05:39,519 --> 02:05:42,059
LIAM: But you know how to get there.

1667
02:05:42,059 --> 02:05:47,065
MATT: "I know how to get there, but it's not an
easy, let alone safe, route."

1668
02:05:47,065 --> 02:05:48,854
LAURA: Well, we'll protect you.

1669
02:05:48,854 --> 02:05:54,014
MATT: "So you're saying that as part of this
agreement, I will be your guide to the outskirts

1670
02:05:54,014 --> 02:05:56,451
"of the Shademirk? Because I am not going in
there."

1671
02:05:56,451 --> 02:05:58,187
TRAVIS: If you want your book back.

1672
02:05:58,187 --> 02:06:03,686
LAURA: Have you heard of a very large-- well, I
don't know if it's large. A very scary tree there?

1673
02:06:03,686 --> 02:06:05,929
Something poisoning the land?

1674
02:06:05,929 --> 02:06:11,516
MATT: "The land there is poisoned. I haven't gone
in there myself. I'm sure there's many poison trees."

1675
02:06:11,516 --> 02:06:16,920
TRAVIS: How far from here would you say it is?

1676
02:06:16,920 --> 02:06:27,798
MATT: "Day and a half, maybe? Duskward-seaward,
maybe?"

1677
02:06:27,798 --> 02:06:31,184
TRAVIS: He's been very helpful. Maybe he could
just point us in the direction.

1678
02:06:31,184 --> 02:06:37,058
SAM: No, we're taking him. We're taking him as far
as we can. We need guides who know the land.

1679
02:06:37,058 --> 02:06:42,387
MATT: "Then let us make the other side of this
agreement. You want me to be your guide, you'll

1680
02:06:42,387 --> 02:06:50,837
"give me back my book." He sets the drink down.
"Back my book, and--" He looks at the rest of you.

1681
02:06:50,837 --> 02:06:56,350
"You seem to speak like you know thievery, yes?"

1682
02:06:56,350 --> 02:06:59,467
SAM: One of us is a member of a thieves' guild.

1683
02:06:59,467 --> 02:07:12,345
MATT: "There's a few things in that there dreary
elvish city that I haven't the skills to procure,

1684
02:07:12,345 --> 02:07:19,391
"but if you wouldn't mind maybe borrowing them for
me in my stead, well, we've a done deal."

1685
02:07:19,391 --> 02:07:22,353
TRAVIS: Borrowing them indefinitely.

1686
02:07:22,353 --> 02:07:25,476
LIAM: What are we discussing, exactly?

1687
02:07:25,476 --> 02:07:27,320
SAM: Quid pro quo?

1688
02:07:27,320 --> 02:07:28,761
MATT: "If you will."

1689
02:07:28,761 --> 02:07:31,631
LAURA: I've got no problem stealing from any of
those people.

1690
02:07:31,631 --> 02:07:39,695
LIAM: Yes, but the devil's in the details. What
are we after? Tell me a little bit more.

1691
02:07:39,695 --> 02:07:42,136
MATT: "We make the agreement first."

1692
02:07:42,136 --> 02:07:43,898
LIAM: Say again?

1693
02:07:43,898 --> 02:07:48,043
MATT: "We make the agreement first. Consider it a
bit of trust!"

1694
02:07:48,043 --> 02:07:49,898
LIAM: Balls is what that is.

1695
02:07:49,898 --> 02:07:55,613
TALIESIN: Let us add an addendum, then. If we are
going to steal things from you, you will not only

1696
02:07:55,613 --> 02:07:57,387
take us to the bog--

1697
02:07:57,387 --> 02:07:59,802
MARISHA: But you'll take us to our final
destination.

1698
02:07:59,802 --> 02:08:01,700
MATT: "Nope, no. No Shademirk. I'm out. Sorry."

1699
02:08:01,700 --> 02:08:03,533
SAM: Or we could kill you here.

1700
02:08:03,533 --> 02:08:04,798
TALIESIN: Are we killing people?

1701
02:08:04,798 --> 02:08:06,409
SAM: We could kill him.

1702
02:08:06,409 --> 02:08:08,122
TRAVIS: Do I get to grab him again?

1703
02:08:08,122 --> 02:08:11,928
MARISHA: Remember, you have to be nice to things
in the Feywild. This is what we've learned.

1704
02:08:11,928 --> 02:08:15,080
SAM: We have a powerful position in negotiation.
I'm a master negotiator.

1705
02:08:15,080 --> 02:08:16,267
TALIESIN: No.

1706
02:08:16,267 --> 02:08:19,804
MARISHA: What is he doing?

1707
02:08:19,804 --> 02:08:32,344
SAM: Who's getting whispered to? Percy? Percy goes
blind again. Every five minutes.

1708
02:08:32,344 --> 02:08:35,188
TALIESIN: This is interesting. 17.

1709
02:08:35,188 --> 02:08:39,352
SAM: A roll and a re-whisper.

1710
02:08:39,352 --> 02:08:46,408
LAURA: The Feywild. Slippery. Sneaky.

1711
02:08:46,408 --> 02:08:50,457
SAM: This is crazy.

1712
02:08:50,457 --> 02:08:52,500
TALIESIN: Interesting.

1713
02:08:52,500 --> 02:08:58,415
SAM: He just said the C-word, the F-word, the
G-word!

1714
02:08:58,415 --> 02:09:06,637
MATT: "If it's that important to you to go to this
dark place, then keep the book, all right? I can

1715
02:09:06,637 --> 02:09:07,828
"draw more."

1716
02:09:07,828 --> 02:09:14,753
TALIESIN: I've got an idea. We broke your ocarina,
correct?

1717
02:09:14,753 --> 02:09:16,379
MATT: "Yes."

1718
02:09:16,379 --> 02:09:22,755
TALIESIN: Why don't I try and fix the ocarina? We
give him his book back, we take a couple things

1719
02:09:22,755 --> 02:09:29,321
from those people and get on our way? We could
just get on our way.

1720
02:09:29,321 --> 02:09:32,360
MARISHA: Not have him at all?

1721
02:09:32,360 --> 02:09:36,970
TALIESIN: No, let's make the deal and get this
moving. This is a place where deals happen. Let's

1722
02:09:36,970 --> 02:09:38,553
do it.

1723
02:09:38,553 --> 02:09:44,744
TRAVIS: But you're usually so picky about details.
What if he asks us to steal somebody?

1724
02:09:44,744 --> 02:09:49,156
LIAM: We're talking about a pantsless cartoonist
in the middle of fairy land.

1725
02:09:49,156 --> 02:09:53,059
TALIESIN: We agree to the deal, we present it, and
then we're there.

1726
02:09:53,059 --> 02:09:57,117
LAURA: If we can't steal the things, then the deal
is off.

1727
02:09:57,117 --> 02:10:02,961
MATT: "It's that simple. We both go our separate
ways, and good luck finding the Shademirk on your own."

1728
02:10:02,961 --> 02:10:07,951
TALIESIN: It's kismet, in my opinion.

1729
02:10:07,951 --> 02:10:11,395
LAURA: Well, I trust you, Percy, if you think it's
smart.

1730
02:10:11,395 --> 02:10:14,578
ASHLEY: Can I insight check Percy? Because he's
acting a little strange.

1731
02:10:14,578 --> 02:10:16,600
LIAM: Same.

1732
02:10:16,600 --> 02:10:21,843
MATT: You can make an insight check, but he's not
acting too far out of his normal place here.

1733
02:10:21,843 --> 02:10:25,400
LIAM: Yeah, but I've done insight checks before
because he's Percy.

1734
02:10:25,400 --> 02:10:30,729
LAURA: Did you do it?

1735
02:10:30,729 --> 02:10:32,676
ASHLEY: Yeah, but I didn't get anything.

1736
02:10:32,676 --> 02:10:36,350
LIAM: I got a 15. Balls.

1737
02:10:36,350 --> 02:10:43,920
MATT: It's an interestingly tense conversation.
It's hard to ride one way or the other, but it's a

1738
02:10:43,920 --> 02:10:49,644
valid point. If worse comes to worst, and what
he's asking for is beyond your grasp or something

1739
02:10:49,644 --> 02:10:52,097
that you wish not to do, then the deal is off and
you go your separate ways.

1740
02:10:52,097 --> 02:10:56,837
TALIESIN: We're in the Feywild. We're going to
make a deal with something. This is what the

1741
02:10:56,837 --> 02:10:58,664
Feywild is.

1742
02:10:58,664 --> 02:11:00,384
TRAVIS: All right. Fine.

1743
02:11:00,384 --> 02:11:05,179
LIAM: I turn to Vex. You like this idea? You want
to do this?

1744
02:11:05,179 --> 02:11:11,404
LAURA: I have no love for that city. I don't
care.

1745
02:11:11,404 --> 02:11:13,922
TALIESIN: I want to go there, too.

1746
02:11:13,922 --> 02:11:18,830
MARISHA: The people we're stealing from better be
meanies, though, and they better have deserved it

1747
02:11:18,830 --> 02:11:20,233
at some point.

1748
02:11:20,233 --> 02:11:27,643
LAURA: Ultimately, I would love to ask them to
help us in our fight. They're cowardly and stupid

1749
02:11:27,643 --> 02:11:32,650
for hiding, but we could use their help if they're
making an army.

1750
02:11:32,650 --> 02:11:37,384
LIAM: Possibly better equipped and better
educated, sorry, than this one here.

1751
02:11:37,384 --> 02:11:43,253
MARISHA: Well, Garmelie also said they were
strengthening up an army. Did they ever have a

1752
02:11:43,253 --> 02:11:45,058
standing army before?

1753
02:11:45,058 --> 02:11:46,464
MATT: They did.

1754
02:11:46,464 --> 02:11:49,830
LAURA: They did? Of course they did. They're a
city.

1755
02:11:49,830 --> 02:11:57,508
MATT: It wasn't a huge army, per se, but they had
trained forces, and they had a means of defending

1756
02:11:57,508 --> 02:11:58,932
their city.

1757
02:11:58,932 --> 02:12:01,865
LAURA: We had a fight instructor when we were
growing up.

1758
02:12:01,865 --> 02:12:06,075
LIAM: They're elves. They're very civilized.
They've all got sticks up their asses. They're

1759
02:12:06,075 --> 02:12:07,414
fucking elves.

1760
02:12:07,414 --> 02:12:08,688
TALIESIN: I can't wait.

1761
02:12:08,688 --> 02:12:09,831
MATT: "I like this one."

1762
02:12:09,831 --> 02:12:11,819
SAM: Are you going to fix his what-is-it-called?

1763
02:12:11,819 --> 02:12:14,779
TALIESIN: Give me your ocarina. Let me see if I
can get to work on it.

1764
02:12:14,779 --> 02:12:16,152
MARISHA: I can help Percy.

1765
02:12:16,152 --> 02:12:22,347
SAM: I will inspire Percy by singing. (singing) Go
ahead, Percy, and fix his ocarina! Take your

1766
02:12:22,347 --> 02:12:26,671
tinkering tools and fix his ocarina! You go,
Percival, you can fix his ocarina!

1767
02:12:26,671 --> 02:12:28,686
ALL: Hey, ocarina!

1768
02:12:28,686 --> 02:12:31,587
MATT: Take your d10.

1769
02:12:31,587 --> 02:12:34,698
MARISHA: Can I help with a Mending spell?

1770
02:12:34,698 --> 02:12:37,331
TALIESIN: You can help with a Mending spell.

1771
02:12:37,331 --> 02:12:44,778
MATT: Mending spell? Do you have the cantrip?
Mending is a cantrip.

1772
02:12:44,778 --> 02:12:47,663
LIAM: I thought she used it once before on
something.

1773
02:12:47,663 --> 02:12:52,419
MARISHA: I thought I used it as a ritual spell
before.

1774
02:12:52,419 --> 02:12:56,433
LIAM: You fixed that little Sarenrae doll.

1775
02:12:56,433 --> 02:13:00,628
MATT: Right. So you have the spell, correct?

1776
02:13:00,628 --> 02:13:06,132
MARISHA: I thought I learned it. I don't know.

1777
02:13:06,132 --> 02:13:08,343
LIAM: Oh jeez, here comes the internet.

1778
02:13:08,343 --> 02:13:12,398
MATT: Cantrips you have at all times.

1779
02:13:12,398 --> 02:13:15,467
MARISHA: Can I use it as a 1st-level spell?

1780
02:13:15,467 --> 02:13:17,487
MATT: What cantrips do you know?

1781
02:13:17,487 --> 02:13:25,274
MARISHA: Guidance, Druidcraft. I used Druidcraft
before, for the wooden thing. Can I use Druidcraft

1782
02:13:25,274 --> 02:13:26,826
to help this?

1783
02:13:26,826 --> 02:13:28,801
MATT: How would you use Druidcraft?

1784
02:13:28,801 --> 02:13:30,646
MARISHA: What's it made out of? Is it made out of
wood?

1785
02:13:30,646 --> 02:13:33,204
MATT: Actually, it's made out of clay, yeah.

1786
02:13:33,204 --> 02:13:36,301
TALIESIN: So I'm going to attempt to glue it
together, and then I'm going to need something to

1787
02:13:36,301 --> 02:13:40,599
hold the whole thing together while the glue
sets.

1788
02:13:40,599 --> 02:13:48,692
MATT: Okay. Using what materials are within the
workshop that you had before, there is a very mild

1789
02:13:48,692 --> 02:13:53,398
adhesive paste that you construct. Go ahead and
make a tinkering roll. This will be with your

1790
02:13:53,398 --> 02:13:54,735
intelligence modifier.

1791
02:13:54,735 --> 02:13:56,355
TALIESIN: That was a natural 20.

1792
02:13:56,355 --> 02:14:05,526
MATT: Very rapidly, with the things that are given
at your disposal, not even needing the materials

1793
02:14:05,526 --> 02:14:09,179
here, but what you have on you as part of your
traveling tinkering kit, you piece together a

1794
02:14:09,179 --> 02:14:22,190
nearly unnoticeable binding agent for clay and
dirt and earth-based materials. You manage to fix

1795
02:14:22,190 --> 02:14:26,214
the ocarina rather quickly, in a period of maybe
20 minutes, and with the help of Keyleth's

1796
02:14:26,214 --> 02:14:29,637
Druidcraft, dry it and manage to get it fixed.

1797
02:14:29,637 --> 02:14:34,998
TALIESIN: Your instrument, sir.

1798
02:14:34,998 --> 02:14:40,395
MATT: "Thank you. That's one good deed you've done
me today. I appreciate that."

1799
02:14:40,395 --> 02:14:43,745
TRAVIS: Don't forget about all them ales, yeah?

1800
02:14:43,745 --> 02:14:52,468
MATT: (whistles) It's awful. He doesn't really
know how to play, and it's like (off-key singing).

1801
02:14:52,468 --> 02:14:54,134
TALIESIN: It's quite nice.

1802
02:14:54,134 --> 02:14:57,130
TRAVIS: At least you can always draw.

1803
02:14:57,130 --> 02:15:00,997
MATT: "If I can find my quill."

1804
02:15:00,997 --> 02:15:06,208
LAURA: I'm sorry. I said I'm sorry. I looked for
20 fucking minutes. I looked, all right?

1805
02:15:06,208 --> 02:15:08,474
ASHLEY: I'm sure we could find you a quill.

1806
02:15:08,474 --> 02:15:12,455
LIAM: I've got one right fucking here. I pull the
black feather out from behind my ear and hold it

1807
02:15:12,455 --> 02:15:18,922
up. This is a very fine feather to sweeten the
deal. Don't fuck us over. And I slide it into the book.

1808
02:15:18,922 --> 02:15:21,703
TRAVIS: Don't give him that, Vax. It's too nice!

1809
02:15:21,703 --> 02:15:26,376
LAURA: No, it is really nice! I know you're acting
like he's lying, but he's telling the fucking truth.

1810
02:15:26,376 --> 02:15:29,083
SAM: Good lie, Grog.

1811
02:15:29,083 --> 02:15:38,084
LIAM: We've really been burned. I am really going
to punch you in the back of the head if you fuck

1812
02:15:38,084 --> 02:15:40,918
us over. Do you understand me? I don't like you.

1813
02:15:40,918 --> 02:15:49,234
MATT: "I like you! Well. Are we at an agreement?

1814
02:15:49,234 --> 02:15:52,670
LAURA: Sure, why not. Me?

1815
02:15:52,670 --> 02:15:54,230
SAM: Who's he shaking?

1816
02:15:54,230 --> 02:15:56,168
MATT: "Whoever your leader is! Shake my hand."

1817
02:15:56,168 --> 02:15:58,071
LIAM: Here, give me your fucking hand, you dirty
bastard.

1818
02:15:58,071 --> 02:16:03,477
MATT: Before you got your hand there, Vax, Vex put
her hand in, and both of you guys clasp both sides

1819
02:16:03,477 --> 02:16:06,858
of his hand at the same time. A trio handshake.

1820
02:16:06,858 --> 02:16:11,391
LIAM: I'm pretty sure he was talking to me.

1821
02:16:11,391 --> 02:16:13,537
LAURA: I'm pretty sure he was talking to me,
actually.

1822
02:16:13,537 --> 02:16:20,371
MATT: All right, so you guys shake hands with him.
You feel this shiver on your back as you shake

1823
02:16:20,371 --> 02:16:28,432
hands, and he smiles. "Very well. Now, we've
properly gotten acquainted. My sharper

1824
02:16:28,432 --> 02:16:32,825
"introductions are in order." He stands up and
wobbles for a second, a little drunk on the ale.

1825
02:16:32,825 --> 02:16:40,216
"My name is Garmelie. I am a simple joy finder of
the ever-shifting grasses, and I am happy to be

1826
02:16:40,216 --> 02:16:44,849
your guide for the remainder of this journey to
the outskirts of the Shademirk, and no further.

1827
02:16:44,849 --> 02:16:50,836
"Three things you wish you avoid as you progress
further. As we are traveling through the

1828
02:16:50,836 --> 02:16:57,794
"Moonbrush, alongside the Green Sea-- we could take
one or the other, your choice. Eventually finding

1829
02:16:57,794 --> 02:17:04,561
"our way to the Gilded Run, and from there on to
the Shademirk itself. I'll be leaving you at the

1830
02:17:04,561 --> 02:17:10,417
"outskirts of the Gilded Run, but it should suffice
for the journey you wish to have ahead.

1831
02:17:10,417 --> 02:17:24,607
"Things you wish to avoid. One, the Hut of
Wodenna. She's a terrible woman. You see a hut,

1832
02:17:24,607 --> 02:17:28,328
don't go. You may smell enticing things."

1833
02:17:28,328 --> 02:17:29,747
LIAM: Odenna?

1834
02:17:29,747 --> 02:17:40,273
MATT: "Wodenna. Delightful smells, sounds of soft
music, a gentle light across the shade and sea.

1835
02:17:40,273 --> 02:17:52,249
"Two words at once. I'm drunk. But do not go near
the hut. Avoid the hut. No hut!

1836
02:17:52,249 --> 02:17:59,736
"Two. Avoid the Last Campsite of Sorudun the
Happy."

1837
02:17:59,736 --> 02:18:01,768
SAM: Sounds nice.

1838
02:18:01,768 --> 02:18:03,189
LIAM: Yeah, that sounds fun.

1839
02:18:03,189 --> 02:18:13,317
MATT: "Avoid it. Trust me, avoid it. If there's a
campsite that's empty, looks happy? Avoid it. And

1840
02:18:13,317 --> 02:18:15,070
"three, avoid the theater."

1841
02:18:15,070 --> 02:18:16,730
SAM: I love the theater!

1842
02:18:16,730 --> 02:18:18,446
LIAM: Oh, that's good advice, actually.

1843
02:18:18,446 --> 02:18:19,789
MATT: "Avoid the theater."

1844
02:18:19,789 --> 02:18:21,234
SAM: Just in general, the theater?

1845
02:18:21,234 --> 02:18:24,634
MATT: "In general. I hate all theater. Let's avoid
the theater, please!"

1846
02:18:24,634 --> 02:18:26,327
SAM: I do an insight check.

1847
02:18:26,327 --> 02:18:27,699
MATT: Do it.

1848
02:18:27,699 --> 02:18:34,733
SAM: I don't know what I have. Terrible. 13.

1849
02:18:34,778 --> 02:18:37,942
MATT: He seems pretty perturbed by the idea of
theater.

1850
02:18:37,942 --> 02:18:41,702
LIAM: I'm changing my mind on this guy.

1851
02:18:41,702 --> 02:18:51,011
LAURA: Why should we avoid the hut? What does
Wodenna do?

1852
02:18:51,011 --> 02:18:54,743
MATT: "She's been around a while."

1853
02:18:54,743 --> 02:18:56,784
LAURA: She's a hag? Is she a hag?

1854
02:18:56,784 --> 02:19:03,742
MATT: "That's a name. Best to avoid. Trust me."

1855
02:19:03,742 --> 02:19:05,589
SAM: We do nothing but trust you.

1856
02:19:05,589 --> 02:19:08,773
MATT: "Great. Wondrous. And who are you, by the
way?"

1857
02:19:08,835 --> 02:19:11,382
MARISHA: We're Vox Machina.

1858
02:19:11,382 --> 02:19:12,871
SAM: The Slayer's Take.

1859
02:19:12,871 --> 02:19:18,208
MATT: "Vox Machina Slayer's Take. Very well.
Pleasure to meet you all, Vox Machina Slayer's

1860
02:19:18,208 --> 02:19:21,677
"Take." He holds his drink out for you to fill
again.

1861
02:19:21,677 --> 02:19:23,938
TRAVIS: How many fingers am I holding up?

1862
02:19:23,938 --> 02:19:34,903
MATT: "I don't care. Thank you. Now, the deal is
made, drink's been had, introductions have been

1863
02:19:34,903 --> 02:19:41,414
"properly given. I think it's time for bed." He
takes two steps forward, (thud) face-first in the

1864
02:19:41,414 --> 02:19:44,530
center of the main area, and starts snoring
loudly.

1865
02:19:44,530 --> 02:19:50,453
LAURA: Maybe we should move him to a safe location
that we can lock.

1866
02:19:50,453 --> 02:19:52,898
LIAM: With those 20 guards, right, Scanlan?

1867
02:19:52,898 --> 02:19:58,912
ASHLEY: Can I take his ocarina? Just for the
night?

1868
02:19:58,912 --> 02:20:00,630
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check.

1869
02:20:00,630 --> 02:20:02,994
ASHLEY: He's asleep, so do I get advantage or
something?

1870
02:20:02,994 --> 02:20:07,283
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check.

1871
02:20:07,283 --> 02:20:12,130
ASHLEY: Natural 20.

1872
02:20:12,130 --> 02:20:27,135
MATT: You sneak forward, and in a move that
would've made Vax proud, you pull the ocarina from

1873
02:20:27,135 --> 02:20:29,897
his grasp, show it to the rest of the party, and
tuck it away.

1874
02:20:29,897 --> 02:20:34,115
ASHLEY: I look over at Vax and give him a wink.
And Vex!

1875
02:20:34,115 --> 02:20:38,957
LIAM: That was primo, baby.

1876
02:20:38,957 --> 02:20:40,376
ASHLEY: Thanks.

1877
02:20:40,376 --> 02:20:42,070
SAM: Hey, Keyleth.

1878
02:20:42,070 --> 02:20:42,993
MARISHA: Yeah?

1879
02:20:42,993 --> 02:20:52,475
SAM: You've got magic. I don't entirely trust this
thing. We were told specifically not to trust

1880
02:20:52,524 --> 02:21:00,194
anything. Do you have any spell that can do
true-seeing, or that can restore him if he's

1881
02:21:00,194 --> 02:21:06,609
putting on this form, or that can dispel some
charm that he has around him or some aura?

1882
02:21:06,609 --> 02:21:10,433
LAURA: Maybe some sort of magical thing that he
put on me, because I'm pretty sure he cast

1883
02:21:10,433 --> 02:21:12,218
something on me and my brother.

1884
02:21:12,218 --> 02:21:14,932
MARISHA: Really? What happened? What did you
feel?

1885
02:21:14,932 --> 02:21:17,101
LAURA: A shiver. When we shook his hand.

1886
02:21:17,101 --> 02:21:18,723
MARISHA: Okay. Yeah.

1887
02:21:18,723 --> 02:21:24,710
ASHLEY: He never told us what he wanted you to
get, what he wanted to steal.

1888
02:21:24,710 --> 02:21:26,491
TALIESIN: No, he hasn't.

1889
02:21:26,491 --> 02:21:34,157
SAM: Pikey, do you have something that can reveal
some truth or dispel magic from him?

1890
02:21:34,157 --> 02:21:37,814
MARISHA: I actually have Dispel Magic right now.

1891
02:21:37,814 --> 02:21:44,351
LAURA: Can we try it? On me and my brother, see if
it cancels out whatever he just did?

1892
02:21:44,351 --> 02:21:56,953
MARISHA: I'll touch Vex and cast Dispel Magic and
see if anything happens. Wait, take off all

1893
02:21:56,953 --> 02:21:58,535
magical items first.

1894
02:21:58,535 --> 02:22:00,534
LAURA: Everything I'm wearing is magic.

1895
02:22:00,534 --> 02:22:02,106
MARISHA: Well, take it off.

1896
02:22:02,106 --> 02:22:03,952
TRAVIS: Yeah, take it off!

1897
02:22:03,952 --> 02:22:08,495
LAURA: What is it about this dimension that makes
us get naked all the time?

1898
02:22:08,495 --> 02:22:12,776
SAM: The hat is not magic. You can leave that on.

1899
02:22:12,776 --> 02:22:14,778
LAURA: Thank you. So I take off everything except
for the hat.

1900
02:22:14,778 --> 02:22:19,020
MARISHA: I don't want to risk dispelling
anything.

1901
02:22:19,020 --> 02:22:22,119
LIAM: I'm taking a short walk, all right.

1902
02:22:22,119 --> 02:22:26,829
TALIESIN: Every time I've seen anything attractive
and naked, it's gone very poorly today. I'm

1903
02:22:26,829 --> 02:22:28,031
walking away.

1904
02:22:28,031 --> 02:22:30,376
MARISHA: It's like wearing metal in a really hot
sauna. You just don't do it. Come on.

1905
02:22:30,376 --> 02:22:33,291
MATT: Roll a d20 and add your wisdom modifier.

1906
02:22:33,291 --> 02:22:42,467
MARISHA: All right. I'll do the big guy. Come on,
big guy. Oh, that's okay. My wisdom, just my

1907
02:22:42,467 --> 02:22:46,156
modifier? 22.

1908
02:22:46,156 --> 02:22:48,456
MATT: Okay. You cast the spell.

1909
02:22:48,456 --> 02:22:51,452
ASHLEY: Do you feel different?

1910
02:22:51,452 --> 02:22:56,056
MARISHA: That was a very high wisdom roll. Do you
feel anything?

1911
02:22:56,056 --> 02:22:57,493
LAURA: Do I feel anything?

1912
02:22:57,493 --> 02:22:59,257
MATT: You didn't feel anything in particular.

1913
02:22:59,257 --> 02:23:04,924
TRAVIS: Give it a minute. It might take a while to
take effect. Maybe do some jumping jacks.

1914
02:23:04,924 --> 02:23:06,714
LAURA: I'm definitely putting my clothes back on.

1915
02:23:06,714 --> 02:23:10,812
MARISHA: I can also try a Regeneration spell.

1916
02:23:10,812 --> 02:23:20,628
SAM: Wait. I think I can do something. I can sing
a song. That's mostly what I do, if you haven't

1917
02:23:20,628 --> 02:23:31,586
noticed by now. I have a power that I never ever
use. It's called Countercharm. I can counter charms.

1918
02:23:31,586 --> 02:23:35,115
MATT: As they're being cast. So you still can't
use it.

1919
02:23:35,115 --> 02:23:38,288
(laughter)

1920
02:23:38,288 --> 02:23:45,305
TALIESIN: I'm going to start gathering the
servants to pick the boy up and put him in his room.

1921
02:23:45,305 --> 02:23:50,419
MATT: And the 20 guards lift his form and carry
him off.

1922
02:23:50,419 --> 02:23:52,976
TRAVIS: Don't let him steal any of our shit.

1923
02:23:52,976 --> 02:23:55,692
TALIESIN: Everything would disappear, anyway.

1924
02:23:55,692 --> 02:23:57,904
TRAVIS: No, I mean our personal shit.

1925
02:23:57,904 --> 02:23:59,333
LAURA: Lock the door.

1926
02:23:59,333 --> 02:24:03,907
TRAVIS: Yeah, but what if he can do Scanlan's
thing where he goes through the door?

1927
02:24:03,907 --> 02:24:10,159
MARISHA: I have a feeling if he shook your hand
and did something, like Scanlan said, it's

1928
02:24:10,159 --> 02:24:18,087
probably a Pike thing, like a Remove Curse. It's
got to be something more like that. Mine is all

1929
02:24:18,087 --> 02:24:24,473
nature-based. I can try to Regenerate you, but I
don't think this would fall under that.

1930
02:24:24,473 --> 02:24:28,840
TRAVIS: She's fine. It was a draft. She needs to
wear more clothes. It's all right.

1931
02:24:28,840 --> 02:24:31,605
ASHLEY: Do you feel different?

1932
02:24:31,605 --> 02:24:33,383
LAURA: No, not anymore.

1933
02:24:33,383 --> 02:24:40,121
MARISHA: I have a feeling it's like if you stray
from a contract or something, you might feel it. I

1934
02:24:40,121 --> 02:24:42,181
don't know. That's what I would think.

1935
02:24:42,181 --> 02:24:51,720
TRAVIS: I'll go to bed. And I sleep on all of my
weapons and stuff. They're under me, on top of the

1936
02:24:51,720 --> 02:24:52,999
mattress.

1937
02:24:52,999 --> 02:24:55,137
MATT: Perfect. Everyone else go to bed?

1938
02:24:55,137 --> 02:25:05,681
MARISHA: I put a blanket over the satyr, and I pet
him, now that he's asleep. Is his fur coarse, or

1939
02:25:05,681 --> 02:25:07,079
is it soft?

1940
02:25:07,079 --> 02:25:08,516
MATT: It's pretty coarse.

1941
02:25:08,516 --> 02:25:10,019
LAURA: That is really creepy.

1942
02:25:10,019 --> 02:25:11,950
TRAVIS: Creepy, unconsented petting farm.

1943
02:25:11,950 --> 02:25:13,599
MARISHA: Okay, good night.

1944
02:25:13,599 --> 02:25:28,313
TALIESIN: I make sure everything's fine. I will
leave him his book, lock the door, and head up to

1945
02:25:28,313 --> 02:25:30,203
my room and lock the door behind me, as well.

1946
02:25:30,203 --> 02:25:33,046
SAM: I stayed up all night reading.

1947
02:25:33,046 --> 02:25:37,522
MARISHA: Are you going to take a point of
exhaustion for that?

1948
02:25:37,522 --> 02:25:38,738
SAM: I have to.

1949
02:25:38,738 --> 02:25:41,519
LAURA: I get very little sleep. I'm having trouble
sleeping.

1950
02:25:41,519 --> 02:25:43,232
TRAVIS: You are?

1951
02:25:43,232 --> 02:25:46,677
MATT: All right. So this is your second level of
exhaustion.

1952
02:25:46,677 --> 02:25:49,115
SAM: No, I slept last time.

1953
02:25:49,115 --> 02:25:52,213
MATT: Oh, that's right! You did sleep. Correct. So
you do take another point of exhaustion now, so

1954
02:25:52,213 --> 02:25:56,301
you're back to one point of exhaustion. So all
your ability checks are at disadvantage.

1955
02:25:56,301 --> 02:25:58,579
ASHLEY: How long does that take?

1956
02:25:58,579 --> 02:26:00,356
TALIESIN: A week.

1957
02:26:00,356 --> 02:26:02,969
ASHLEY: It takes a week? To memorize it?

1958
02:26:02,969 --> 02:26:09,084
SAM: I think it was 48 hours of reading over a
period of six days.

1959
02:26:09,084 --> 02:26:11,152
LAURA: Oh jeez.

1960
02:26:11,152 --> 02:26:12,402
SAM: Yeah.

1961
02:26:12,402 --> 02:26:13,785
ASHLEY: How close?

1962
02:26:13,785 --> 02:26:20,732
SAM: I'm on day four, I believe. And I'm up to 36
hours now, if this counts as ten, 12 hours.

1963
02:26:20,732 --> 02:26:23,508
ASHLEY and LAURA: Wow.

1964
02:26:23,508 --> 02:26:25,839
MARISHA: So you're close. Yeah, you're doing
good.

1965
02:26:25,839 --> 02:26:26,953
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1966
02:26:26,953 --> 02:26:29,265
MATT: All right. Anyone else doing anything?

1967
02:26:29,265 --> 02:26:33,033
MARISHA: I sleep, and I dream of fireflies and the
Feywild because it's so magical.

1968
02:26:33,033 --> 02:26:34,810
MATT: There you go.

1969
02:26:34,810 --> 02:26:39,431
ASHLEY: I'm going to get up early, but yeah.

1970
02:26:39,431 --> 02:26:47,197
LAURA: I'm going to get up early and try to fix my
hair and make it as pristine as I can and try to

1971
02:26:47,197 --> 02:26:49,697
clean off my clothes and everything before we go.

1972
02:26:49,697 --> 02:26:52,197
LIAM: I sleep like a baby in my armor.

1973
02:26:52,197 --> 02:26:56,217
MATT: All right. Percy, as you're getting ready to
go to bed, you feel this strange tickle at the

1974
02:26:56,217 --> 02:26:58,575
back of your head that dissipates.

1975
02:26:58,575 --> 02:27:00,413
TALIESIN: Is it what I think it is?

1976
02:27:00,413 --> 02:27:03,144
MATT: It is the fading of a Charm Person spell.

1977
02:27:03,144 --> 02:27:04,367
TALIESIN: Okay. Goddamn it.

1978
02:27:04,367 --> 02:27:08,029
MARISHA: Son of a fuck.

1979
02:27:08,029 --> 02:27:13,820
TALIESIN: And as I'm going to bed? Or as I wake
up?

1980
02:27:13,820 --> 02:27:15,767
MATT: As you're going to bed.

1981
02:27:15,804 --> 02:27:18,793
TALIESIN: Okay. Fuck.

1982
02:27:18,793 --> 02:27:22,931
TRAVIS: Did you fuck us?

1983
02:27:22,931 --> 02:27:26,390
LAURA: Percy was charmed.

1984
02:27:26,390 --> 02:27:32,017
TALIESIN: No, you don't know anything yet. I'm not
quite going to go to sleep yet. I'm going to go

1985
02:27:32,017 --> 02:27:34,756
see who else is still awake.

1986
02:27:34,756 --> 02:27:38,731
MATT: Okay. Scanlan is reading in his room with
the door slightly ajar.

1987
02:27:38,731 --> 02:27:40,314
SAM: Yes?

1988
02:27:40,314 --> 02:27:44,007
TALIESIN: The little fucker charmed me.

1989
02:27:44,007 --> 02:27:51,282
SAM: I knew it! I suspected it! That's why I tried
to use Countercharm, but I don't know how to use it.

1990
02:27:51,282 --> 02:27:54,473
(laughter)

1991
02:27:54,473 --> 02:28:00,590
SAM: Apparently, it's some sort of preemptive
thing. I have to read about it. Oh shit, I'm

1992
02:28:00,590 --> 02:28:02,770
already reading this! Goddamn it!

1993
02:28:02,770 --> 02:28:05,422
(laughter)

1994
02:28:05,422 --> 02:28:07,628
SAM: Anyway. What do you think we should do?

1995
02:28:07,628 --> 02:28:09,142
TALIESIN: I don't know what we can do.

1996
02:28:09,142 --> 02:28:13,439
SAM: Wait. When were you charmed? What did it
affect? What decisions did you make today that

1997
02:28:13,439 --> 02:28:15,324
were <i>key</i>?

1998
02:28:15,324 --> 02:28:21,852
TALIESIN: We made a bloody deal with him.

1999
02:28:21,852 --> 02:28:24,309
SAM: Well, we can always back out on the deal.

2000
02:28:24,309 --> 02:28:27,334
TALIESIN: Well, no, we can't, really.

2001
02:28:27,334 --> 02:28:31,612
SAM: What, is there some sort of blood pact that
we made?

2002
02:28:31,612 --> 02:28:37,124
TALIESIN: (sputtering) I don't know exactly how it
works. It's just in any book you read about the

2003
02:28:37,124 --> 02:28:41,983
Feywild, you make a deal and it's a deal and you
have to deal with it.

2004
02:28:41,983 --> 02:28:45,784
SAM: What does mean? You and I could go down to
his room right now and kill him and be done with it.

2005
02:28:45,784 --> 02:28:47,804
TALIESIN: I don't think that would work.

2006
02:28:47,804 --> 02:28:49,670
SAM: Would we be cursed?

2007
02:28:49,670 --> 02:28:50,622
TALIESIN: Maybe?

2008
02:28:50,622 --> 02:28:51,674
SAM: Haunted forever?

2009
02:28:51,674 --> 02:28:52,711
TALIESIN: Probably.

2010
02:28:52,711 --> 02:29:00,141
SAM: Oh man. That sucks. I don't want to be
haunted. That's for you and Vax!

2011
02:29:00,141 --> 02:29:03,227
(laughter)

2012
02:29:03,227 --> 02:29:05,619
TALIESIN: You would look lovely in eyeliner.

2013
02:29:05,619 --> 02:29:14,810
SAM: No baggage, man, no baggage. What do we do?
We made a deal with a devil of some sort.

2014
02:29:14,810 --> 02:29:16,912
TALIESIN: It was inevitable.

2015
02:29:16,912 --> 02:29:22,751
SAM: Is there a way to trick the trickster into
releasing us from the deal?

2016
02:29:22,751 --> 02:29:24,217
TALIESIN: Could be.

2017
02:29:24,217 --> 02:29:27,169
SAM: Because, you know, I'm a sly talker.

2018
02:29:27,169 --> 02:29:32,175
LIAM: When did this show turn into Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern Are Dead?

2019
02:29:32,175 --> 02:29:34,523
(laughter)

2020
02:29:34,523 --> 02:29:35,762
MATT: Right now.

2021
02:29:35,762 --> 02:29:39,936
TALIESIN: Right now. I'm going to have to tell the
others in the morning. I'm going to go see if

2022
02:29:39,936 --> 02:29:46,119
anybody else is awake. Oh god. Sleep well. Oh,
you're reading. Never mind. Don't sleep.

2023
02:29:46,119 --> 02:29:47,995
SAM: Now I've got to read about the fucking fey,
too.

2024
02:29:47,995 --> 02:29:50,469
TALIESIN: No. Finish your bloody book.

2025
02:29:50,469 --> 02:29:59,159
MATT: Keyleth is at rest, Grog is at rest, Vax is
at rest. Vex is still up, cleaning your garments,

2026
02:29:59,159 --> 02:30:04,007
you said, right? And Pike, you went to bed but are
waking up early, correct? So essentially, it's

2027
02:30:04,007 --> 02:30:05,800
just Vex who's awake.

2028
02:30:05,800 --> 02:30:07,141
TALIESIN: Vex.

2029
02:30:07,141 --> 02:30:08,591
LAURA: Yes?

2030
02:30:08,591 --> 02:30:16,769
TALIESIN: Little shit put a charm on me. I felt it
wear off about 45 minutes ago.

2031
02:30:16,769 --> 02:30:19,993
LAURA: Before we made the deal with him?

2032
02:30:19,993 --> 02:30:21,240
TALIESIN: Yes.

2033
02:30:21,240 --> 02:30:24,627
LAURA: Fuck, Percy! I made the deal because you
said it was fine!

2034
02:30:24,627 --> 02:30:25,848
TALIESIN: Well, I--

2035
02:30:25,848 --> 02:30:29,971
LAURA: It's fine. You didn't know. Well.

2036
02:30:29,971 --> 02:30:33,504
TALIESIN: Well, at least we know that he
definitely can't be trusted.

2037
02:30:33,504 --> 02:30:36,445
LAURA: It's our own stupid fault. We knew we
weren't supposed to trust anything here.

2038
02:30:36,445 --> 02:30:43,554
TALIESIN: I know. We've got to make sure that Pike
doesn't give him back his whistle, just yet.

2039
02:30:43,554 --> 02:30:47,977
LAURA: Why did you want to fix his whistle? You
just liked him.

2040
02:30:47,977 --> 02:30:50,718
TALIESIN: He was so nice! He was just so nice.

2041
02:30:50,718 --> 02:30:54,794
LAURA: Damn it. I thought you knew something we
didn't know. I really thought you did.

2042
02:30:54,794 --> 02:30:59,941
TALIESIN: I did. It's sadly what I knew was he's a
little shit. I just didn't know until about half

2043
02:30:59,941 --> 02:31:03,749
an hour ago. I hate magic!

2044
02:31:03,749 --> 02:31:18,593
LAURA: Percy. Change of subject. Would you say I
look put together? Well off? With this armor.

2045
02:31:18,593 --> 02:31:20,208
TALIESIN: In what sense?

2046
02:31:20,208 --> 02:31:22,177
LAURA: Well, you come from money, right?

2047
02:31:22,177 --> 02:31:23,182
TALIESIN: Yes.

2048
02:31:23,182 --> 02:31:27,499
LAURA: Right, so do I look like I come from
money?

2049
02:31:27,499 --> 02:31:30,094
TALIESIN: Does she look like she comes from
money?

2050
02:31:30,094 --> 02:31:35,826
MATT: That's entirely up to your opinion. You know
the attire she wears; you've traveled with her.

2051
02:31:35,826 --> 02:31:40,876
It's based on what you want to base that judgment
on, whether it be pure looks, the person inside.

2052
02:31:40,876 --> 02:31:45,207
It's whatever Percival thinks she would be in his
eyes.

2053
02:31:45,207 --> 02:31:49,027
SAM: (quietly) She's naked in a hat.

2054
02:31:49,027 --> 02:32:05,691
TALIESIN: (laughs) Honestly, dear, you're too
happy to look like you come from money.

2055
02:32:05,691 --> 02:32:08,364
LAURA: (laughs) I don't believe that.

2056
02:32:08,364 --> 02:32:18,873
TALIESIN: No, it's a sure sign of it, is an
abject misery, believe me. I can speak to it. You

2057
02:32:18,873 --> 02:32:26,350
look too much like you, and you don't look enough
like something you're supposed to be. If you feel

2058
02:32:26,350 --> 02:32:28,821
the urge to deeply bullshit, I'd be happy to help
you. It's not hard.

2059
02:32:28,821 --> 02:32:29,873
LAURA: No?

2060
02:32:29,873 --> 02:32:36,832
TALIESIN: No. It is easy to pretend you come from
money. You just have to be a bit of a shit and wear

2061
02:32:36,832 --> 02:32:49,235
what everybody else is wearing. Does this have
something to do with that city? It does, doesn't

2062
02:32:49,235 --> 02:32:53,302
it. Who's there?

2063
02:32:53,302 --> 02:33:04,902
LAURA: Well, you know. Everyone. We were judged,
growing up, and I don't look forward to seeing

2064
02:33:04,902 --> 02:33:06,530
that again.

2065
02:33:06,530 --> 02:33:10,810
TALIESIN: (sighs) Well.

2066
02:33:10,810 --> 02:33:20,190
LAURA: It's not important.

2067
02:33:20,190 --> 02:33:30,133
TALIESIN: Oh, I disagree. Dear, I think that if
you're worried about them knowing whether or not

2068
02:33:30,133 --> 02:33:37,421
you've made your money and made your fortune-- I
don't think that's going to be the thing to earn

2069
02:33:37,421 --> 02:33:52,454
their respect. I think you're better off, A, with
the company that you keep, and B, with the fact

2070
02:33:52,454 --> 02:33:56,181
that you're probably just better than most of
them.

2071
02:33:56,181 --> 02:33:57,825
LAURA: (laughs)

2072
02:33:57,825 --> 02:34:12,064
TALIESIN: I've known a lot of people with money,
and they are definitely not worth you. And

2073
02:34:12,064 --> 02:34:19,916
besides, if they have something nice that makes
you feel inferior, we can just take it.

2074
02:34:19,916 --> 02:34:22,925
LAURA: (laughs) I like the way you think.

2075
02:34:22,925 --> 02:34:28,269
TALIESIN: Well, and then they're just shit without
anything, and then you're you with their stuff.

2076
02:34:28,269 --> 02:34:30,969
LAURA: Thank you, Percy.

2077
02:34:30,969 --> 02:34:33,622
TALIESIN: You're welcome. I know it doesn't really
help.

2078
02:34:33,622 --> 02:34:39,435
LAURA: Will you stay at my side when we're there?

2079
02:34:39,435 --> 02:34:51,216
TALIESIN: Yes. And the outfit works. Don't change
it. Keep the hat.

2080
02:34:51,216 --> 02:34:55,823
LAURA: (laughs) All right. Good night.

2081
02:34:55,823 --> 02:34:57,390
TALIESIN: Good night. Sleep well.

2082
02:34:57,390 --> 02:35:00,060
LAURA: We'll sort out this charmed mess in the
morning.

2083
02:35:00,060 --> 02:35:02,797
TALIESIN: I'm sorry for my part in it.

2084
02:35:02,797 --> 02:35:10,786
MATT: So you guys go your separate ways. You find
yourself eventually to bed as the rest of the

2085
02:35:10,786 --> 02:35:16,238
group is asleep. Vex, you take a bit of solace in
the conversation, finish cleaning your things,

2086
02:35:16,238 --> 02:35:24,265
though it doesn't seem like the incessant
scrubbing you were driven on has much purpose, nor

2087
02:35:24,265 --> 02:35:30,060
the impact you thought it might at this point, and
you resign yourself to sleep for the evening. As

2088
02:35:30,060 --> 02:35:35,988
the evening comes to a close, Pike, you wake up
early. As you come out of your room, you struggle

2089
02:35:35,988 --> 02:35:44,797
with the view of 20 guards slowly shifting through
the foyer as a very hungover and groaning satyr

2090
02:35:44,797 --> 02:35:53,090
begins clomping through the main foyer, going,
"Breakfast, please? Please, breakfast?"

2091
02:35:53,090 --> 02:35:55,589
ASHLEY: Yes. Follow me to the kitchen.

2092
02:35:55,589 --> 02:36:02,392
MATT: "Yes! Someone they listen to! Thank you!"
Rubbing his eyes as he follows you into the

2093
02:36:02,392 --> 02:36:07,440
kitchen. He comes up onto one of the long benches
in the center of one of the main dining tables.

2094
02:36:07,440 --> 02:36:18,423
ASHLEY: I put down a cup of coffee for him, and I
run into the kitchen and get a very large-- oh no.

2095
02:36:18,423 --> 02:36:20,155
MATT: "Are you poisoning me?!"

2096
02:36:20,155 --> 02:36:21,201
ASHLEY: What's wrong?

2097
02:36:21,201 --> 02:36:22,365
MATT: "What is this?"

2098
02:36:22,365 --> 02:36:23,866
ASHLEY: It's coffee?

2099
02:36:23,866 --> 02:36:26,593
MATT: "I don't like coffee."

2100
02:36:26,593 --> 02:36:28,459
ASHLEY: Oh. What do you want?

2101
02:36:28,459 --> 02:36:30,048
MATT: "Something that's not coffee."

2102
02:36:30,048 --> 02:36:34,825
ASHLEY: Okay. Can we get him something that's not
coffee?

2103
02:36:34,825 --> 02:36:41,627
MATT: The servants look at each other, confused,
and wander off and come back with a carafe of an apple juice.

2104
02:36:41,627 --> 02:36:45,029
ASHLEY: Apple juice will be great.

2105
02:36:45,029 --> 02:36:47,052
MATT: "That is familiar. Thank you." He takes the
carafe.

2106
02:36:47,052 --> 02:36:53,357
ASHLEY: I run in the kitchen really quick and get
a very large piece of butcher paper.

2107
02:36:53,357 --> 02:36:54,525
MATT: Okay.

2108
02:36:54,525 --> 02:36:59,276
ASHLEY: Okay. So. Garmelie.

2109
02:36:59,276 --> 02:37:00,673
MATT: "Yes."

2110
02:37:00,673 --> 02:37:11,606
ASHLEY: I think you're so talented, and I wanted
to ask if maybe you could draw a family portrait

2111
02:37:11,606 --> 02:37:15,845
for us. The most ridiculous you can make it.

2112
02:37:15,845 --> 02:37:17,845
MATT: "What do you mean?"

2113
02:37:17,845 --> 02:37:22,718
ASHLEY: Just of all of us. I want to hang it above
the mantel before everybody wakes up.

2114
02:37:22,718 --> 02:37:30,468
MATT: "Well, it's hard to do without seeing the
subjects, but if you want to fill in the details?"

2115
02:37:30,468 --> 02:37:32,541
ASHLEY: Yeah, fill in the details.

2116
02:37:32,541 --> 02:37:39,108
MATT: "All right. Well, I need a quill or some
charcoal."

2117
02:37:39,108 --> 02:37:41,716
ASHLEY: Vax gave you a quill last night.

2118
02:37:41,716 --> 02:37:44,931
MATT: "He gave me a feather. It has to be refined
into a quill."

2119
02:37:44,931 --> 02:37:48,416
ASHLEY: Oh, I forgot. I think there's one in the
kitchen.

2120
02:37:48,416 --> 02:38:02,742
MATT: There is no quill in the kitchen, but
glancing around and asking the servants, there are

2121
02:38:02,742 --> 02:38:08,490
pieces of charcoal. There is charcoal available,
sketch charcoal.

2122
02:38:08,490 --> 02:38:09,837
ASHLEY: Okay. Can you use charcoal?

2123
02:38:09,837 --> 02:38:10,879
MATT: "Of course."

2124
02:38:10,879 --> 02:38:11,965
ASHLEY: Great.

2125
02:38:11,965 --> 02:38:13,994
MATT: "All right."

2126
02:38:13,994 --> 02:38:15,997
ASHLEY: Have at it.

2127
02:38:15,997 --> 02:38:16,995
MATT: "You first?"

2128
02:38:16,995 --> 02:38:17,942
ASHLEY: Sure.

2129
02:38:17,942 --> 02:38:18,931
MATT: "All right."

2130
02:38:18,931 --> 02:38:24,519
SAM: It's Leonardo and Winslet.

2131
02:38:24,519 --> 02:38:28,993
ASHLEY and MARISHA: Draw me like one of your
French girls!

2132
02:38:28,993 --> 02:38:39,229
MATT: You hear the gentle lyrical stylings of
Celine Dion swell in background as the satyr

2133
02:38:39,229 --> 02:38:41,724
quickly begins sketching your charcoal form.

2134
02:38:41,724 --> 02:38:43,612
ASHLEY: And remember, very ridiculous.

2135
02:38:43,612 --> 02:38:51,808
MATT: "I don't know what that means, but I'll do
my best." In rapid time, faster than anyone you've

2136
02:38:51,808 --> 02:38:58,462
ever seen sketch, his form almost becomes blurred
with the haste in which he draws, and within the

2137
02:38:58,462 --> 02:39:04,769
hour, he has completed an extremely well-detailed
portrait. And I mean portrait, as everyone is

2138
02:39:04,769 --> 02:39:13,859
standing shoulder to shoulder like a family above
a mantel, and it is grotesque. Horrifying. You

2139
02:39:13,859 --> 02:39:20,300
look like perhaps the Trickfoots had been keeping
the bloodline strong for a very long period of

2140
02:39:20,300 --> 02:39:26,473
time. Droopy face, one eye sinking below the
other. You don't even have the right number of fingers.

2141
02:39:26,473 --> 02:39:33,158
You see Grog in the back, who is as wide as the
rest of everybody, is behind them, this giant wall

2142
02:39:33,158 --> 02:39:40,278
with this tiny little head, with a tongue lolling
out to the side. It looks like he has one finger

2143
02:39:40,278 --> 02:39:42,051
as a thumbs-up and the other one's up his bum.

2144
02:39:42,051 --> 02:39:49,922
In the front, you see Vex and Vax, the twins, are
furiously making out in a really horrible display,

2145
02:39:49,922 --> 02:39:53,408
clutching each other. It's terrifying.

2146
02:39:53,408 --> 02:40:02,640
Keyleth is currently clutching the side of a tree
happily, and as she does, her eyes are going in

2147
02:40:02,640 --> 02:40:08,457
different directions, and the tree itself is
trying to push her off the branch.

2148
02:40:08,457 --> 02:40:18,113
You see Percy, who is extremely tall with this
squat, thin head with these giant glasses that

2149
02:40:18,113 --> 02:40:22,267
make his eyes bug-eyed and strange. You see a
little bit of scruff on the chin that's actually

2150
02:40:22,267 --> 02:40:30,609
turning into this long, awful, matted dingleberry
mess of a goatee, and he has both of his guns

2151
02:40:30,609 --> 02:40:32,996
pointed at his head.

2152
02:40:32,996 --> 02:40:47,523
Next to that is a perfectly defined, unchanged
portrait of Scanlan Shorthalt.

2153
02:40:47,523 --> 02:40:55,129
ASHLEY: I just wanted to hear you explain it. So
I'm going to take it and I'm going to paste it

2154
02:40:55,129 --> 02:40:59,165
above the mantel. I'm going to go back upstairs to
my room.

2155
02:40:59,165 --> 02:41:09,205
MATT: Okay. Eventually you all come to
consciousness, brought to the wonderful, welcome

2156
02:41:09,205 --> 02:41:18,944
morning scent of, once again, a chickenful
breakfast. You find yourselves down to a once

2157
02:41:18,944 --> 02:41:26,138
again passed-out satyr, slumped over the breakfast
table with two plates of mostly devoured chicken,

2158
02:41:26,138 --> 02:41:29,237
mashed potatoes, and a couple other side
elements.

2159
02:41:29,237 --> 02:41:30,889
LAURA: That sounds so good.

2160
02:41:30,889 --> 02:41:39,748
MATT: There above, on the mantel across the room,
is a glorious sketch of the family of Vox Machina.

2161
02:41:39,748 --> 02:41:43,051
TALIESIN: Charming.

2162
02:41:43,051 --> 02:41:45,934
SAM: Who changed my-- oh, I look pretty good.

2163
02:41:45,934 --> 02:41:50,175
MARISHA: This is brilliant. Wait, Scanlan, why do
you look normal?

2164
02:41:50,175 --> 02:41:55,175
SAM: I think we all look normal, actually. That's
how I see us, sure.

2165
02:41:55,175 --> 02:41:57,077
LAURA: This picture is disgusting.

2166
02:41:57,077 --> 02:41:58,690
MARISHA: I love it.

2167
02:41:58,690 --> 02:42:01,075
TALIESIN: No, that is awful.

2168
02:42:01,075 --> 02:42:06,397
MARISHA: You guys, we have a souvenir! We have a
souvenir from the Feywild!

2169
02:42:06,397 --> 02:42:10,662
TRAVIS: I think he wants a beating. That's what he
wants.

2170
02:42:10,662 --> 02:42:12,026
LAURA: I flick his head.

2171
02:42:12,026 --> 02:42:13,776
MATT: "Yes, what? What? Hi!"

2172
02:42:13,776 --> 02:42:19,113
TRAVIS: Why would you do that when we've been so
hospitable?

2173
02:42:19,113 --> 02:42:25,634
MATT: "It's a gift." Make a persuasion check.

2174
02:42:25,634 --> 02:42:34,016
ASHLEY: 15.

2175
02:42:34,016 --> 02:42:39,717
MATT: He goes, "I thought I'd leave you a little
present."

2176
02:42:39,717 --> 02:42:41,731
ASHLEY: I love it.

2177
02:42:41,731 --> 02:42:44,548
LAURA: Well, it's gross, but everybody else looks
quite wonderful.

2178
02:42:44,548 --> 02:42:47,727
TALIESIN: I sit down, right in front and across
the table.

2179
02:42:47,727 --> 02:42:50,328
TRAVIS: I guess I don't mind. At least I'm big.

2180
02:42:50,328 --> 02:42:51,545
TALIESIN: I like it.

2181
02:42:51,545 --> 02:42:54,067
LIAM: I think it's gross.

2182
02:42:54,067 --> 02:43:05,508
MATT: "Eat up, and we'll be on our way!" He
notices the tension from Percy and Grog.

2183
02:43:05,508 --> 02:43:11,660
TALIESIN: No, not yet. Not yet. Just so all cards
are on the table, we know that we agreed to a deal

2184
02:43:11,660 --> 02:43:16,000
last night, despite your charm spell on me, which
was--

2185
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:20,536
MATT: "Defending myself! As was warranted."

2186
02:43:20,536 --> 02:43:22,144
TALIESIN: Fair play.

2187
02:43:22,144 --> 02:43:25,365
TRAVIS: You got charmed?

2188
02:43:25,365 --> 02:43:36,727
LAURA: I do think we should inform you, though, we
may have used a little magic on you. Sorry. Just

2189
02:43:36,727 --> 02:43:38,646
to make sure the deal was solid.

2190
02:43:38,646 --> 02:43:41,731
MATT: "I'm certain that was a necessary
precaution."

2191
02:43:41,731 --> 02:43:48,522
TALIESIN: Well, the deal stands as it is at the
moment, I suppose.

2192
02:43:48,522 --> 02:43:52,461
MATT: "Wondrous. I had hoped as such, because we
have much to gain."

2193
02:43:52,461 --> 02:43:55,180
ASHLEY: Wait.

2194
02:43:55,180 --> 02:44:01,739
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, he charmed me. He put a charm
on me last night.

2195
02:44:01,739 --> 02:44:03,566
ASHLEY: I had a feeling.

2196
02:44:03,566 --> 02:44:07,318
LIAM: So you no longer think it's a good idea to
enter into this agreement?

2197
02:44:07,318 --> 02:44:08,791
TALIESIN: Well, a little late.

2198
02:44:08,791 --> 02:44:10,472
MATT: "It is a little late."

2199
02:44:10,472 --> 02:44:12,504
ASHLEY: You never told us what you wanted.

2200
02:44:12,504 --> 02:44:15,768
MATT: "I'm going to show you."

2201
02:44:15,768 --> 02:44:17,422
LAURA: You're going to walk us right in.

2202
02:44:17,422 --> 02:44:19,144
MATT: "Something like that."

2203
02:44:19,144 --> 02:44:21,835
TRAVIS: Well, might as well.

2204
02:44:21,835 --> 02:44:25,043
MARISHA: What are you going to do?

2205
02:44:25,043 --> 02:44:29,573
SAM: Why don't you pet his legs again, weirdo?

2206
02:44:29,573 --> 02:44:32,363
MARISHA: You fascinate me.

2207
02:44:32,363 --> 02:44:36,002
MATT: "Good. That's not the first time I've heard
that."

2208
02:44:36,002 --> 02:44:43,188
TALIESIN: Friend, I applaud your cleverness. I am
excited by this deal, and I want to let you know

2209
02:44:43,188 --> 02:44:52,736
that, god forbid something comes up, where I come
from, the world I come from, I am possibly the

2210
02:44:52,736 --> 02:45:03,097
worst person you have ever met. And I think, I
hope, not necessarily to hurt you or harm you, but

2211
02:45:03,097 --> 02:45:08,441
I hope that one day you can know just how awful I
can be.

2212
02:45:08,441 --> 02:45:10,805
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

2213
02:45:10,805 --> 02:45:16,725
TALIESIN: 17.

2214
02:45:16,725 --> 02:45:26,331
MATT: (stuttering) "I hope it never comes to
that."

2215
02:45:26,331 --> 02:45:28,367
TALIESIN: Let's hope.

2216
02:45:28,367 --> 02:45:34,812
MATT: "I can make addendums to the art piece, if
you're unhappy."

2217
02:45:34,812 --> 02:45:40,400
TALIESIN: I love the art piece. Actually, since
we're on the subject, have you ever drawn yourself

2218
02:45:40,400 --> 02:45:41,803
before?

2219
02:45:41,803 --> 02:45:44,065
MATT: "Many times."

2220
02:45:44,065 --> 02:45:48,893
TALIESIN: I'd be curious to see one of your self
portraits. Are they in the book?

2221
02:45:48,893 --> 02:45:50,220
MATT: "No."

2222
02:45:50,220 --> 02:45:56,881
TALIESIN: I didn't think so. Self-reflection is
not one of my favorite pastimes, either. Anyway,

2223
02:45:56,881 --> 02:45:59,557
what are you looking for in the city?

2224
02:45:59,557 --> 02:46:04,055
MATT: "I'll show you. As part of the agreement,
it'll be unveiled upon arrival."

2225
02:46:04,055 --> 02:46:07,369
SAM: Sounds good to me.

2226
02:46:07,369 --> 02:46:11,183
LAURA: That's not sneaky at all. I fully trust
you.

2227
02:46:11,183 --> 02:46:17,975
MATT: "Great. Now, finish your food! Much to do.
Much to see. Much to take."

2228
02:46:17,975 --> 02:46:22,817
LAURA: I hate him now.

2229
02:46:22,817 --> 02:46:25,404
MATT: (off-key music)

2230
02:46:25,404 --> 02:46:30,202
MARISHA: No. We did that for you. Do not abuse
this. That's right.

2231
02:46:30,202 --> 02:46:34,007
ASHLEY: What are you doing with your hands?

2232
02:46:34,007 --> 02:46:38,836
MATT: "Where did-- What?"

2233
02:46:38,836 --> 02:46:41,365
TALIESIN: Where did what?

2234
02:46:41,365 --> 02:46:47,340
MATT: "They giveth, and they take away."

2235
02:46:47,340 --> 02:46:49,848
TALIESIN: Bless the small print.

2236
02:46:49,848 --> 02:46:57,947
MATT: "Well, then. Eat well." And he makes his way
toward the door, and the guards stop him there.

2237
02:46:57,947 --> 02:47:02,556
"I'll just sit here, then." And sits on the floor,
waiting for you guys to finish.

2238
02:47:02,556 --> 02:47:04,446
LAURA: What sort of magic did you cast on us?

2239
02:47:04,446 --> 02:47:05,960
MATT: "What do you mean?"

2240
02:47:05,960 --> 02:47:10,037
LAURA: What was the deal we agreed to? What will
happen if it breaks?

2241
02:47:10,037 --> 02:47:16,743
MATT: "Deals are meant to be kept. Should you go
against a deal that you've made, especially in

2242
02:47:16,743 --> 02:47:21,910
"here, these realms, there are consequences, so
don't stray from the deal."

2243
02:47:21,910 --> 02:47:27,451
TALIESIN: I think it's just a deal. I think deals
may be a big deal here.

2244
02:47:27,451 --> 02:47:30,097
SAM: So we can still kill him?

2245
02:47:30,097 --> 02:47:34,964
TALIESIN: I don't know. I think if it comes to it,
it's a possibility.

2246
02:47:34,964 --> 02:47:37,513
MARISHA: What happened to don't hurt or touch
anything in the Feywild?

2247
02:47:37,513 --> 02:47:39,870
LAURA: Yeah, we fucked that up, didn't we?

2248
02:47:39,870 --> 02:47:51,609
ASHLEY: Can I take out his ocarina and play a
couple of notes while I'm looking at him?

2249
02:47:51,609 --> 02:47:53,761
MATT: Sure. Make a performance check.

2250
02:47:53,761 --> 02:47:55,690
SAM: Performance check?

2251
02:47:55,690 --> 02:47:56,875
TALIESIN: That's a thing.

2252
02:47:56,875 --> 02:47:58,850
TRAVIS: Is this your first performance check?

2253
02:47:58,850 --> 02:48:02,709
SAM: You're definitely the right person to be
doing this.

2254
02:48:02,709 --> 02:48:06,165
ASHLEY: Yeah, right. 13.

2255
02:48:06,165 --> 02:48:24,250
MATT: 13. In a very rudimentary, kindergarten
recorder way: (off-key music) It's a little shaky,

2256
02:48:24,250 --> 02:48:30,462
but you get the hang of it. It's the only sound in
the room. It's dead quiet as you do this in the

2257
02:48:30,462 --> 02:48:33,506
middle of breakfast, with food being brought to
the table.

2258
02:48:33,506 --> 02:48:35,687
LAURA: That was amazing, Pike.

2259
02:48:35,687 --> 02:48:40,192
LIAM: Move over, Scanlan. Holy hell, that was
good.

2260
02:48:40,192 --> 02:48:44,287
ASHLEY: Thanks. I learned once.

2261
02:48:44,287 --> 02:48:47,945
LAURA: I don't think I've ever seen anyone play an
instrument that well.

2262
02:48:47,945 --> 02:48:50,179
SAM: Wait, hey. This is my house.

2263
02:48:50,179 --> 02:48:57,347
LIAM: Oh, look, the satyr's sad. What's the
matter, friend?

2264
02:48:57,347 --> 02:49:01,682
MATT: "She has my ocarina."

2265
02:49:01,682 --> 02:49:06,071
LAURA: Oh, that's terrible. Poor guy.

2266
02:49:06,071 --> 02:49:08,731
TALIESIN: You're clever. I'm sure you'll be fine.

2267
02:49:08,731 --> 02:49:13,847
ASHLEY: Maybe we'll give it back to you, but I
know what you did to my friend with this little

2268
02:49:13,847 --> 02:49:20,888
thing, so I'm not going to give it back to you.
Not just yet.

2269
02:49:20,888 --> 02:49:22,648
MATT: "Eat your breakfast."

2270
02:49:22,648 --> 02:49:24,340
ASHLEY: Already did.

2271
02:49:24,340 --> 02:49:28,242
LIAM: Somebody get this poor asshole a
handkerchief. He looks so sad.

2272
02:49:28,242 --> 02:49:34,801
MATT: He sits there and pouts. As you guys finish
your meal, laughing and enjoying yourselves.

2273
02:49:34,801 --> 02:49:38,795
MARISHA: As he pouts, I Druidcraft a little flower
crown for him.

2274
02:49:38,795 --> 02:49:47,093
MATT: He somehow recedes even further into his
grumpy self, his neck disappearing as his head

2275
02:49:47,093 --> 02:49:49,228
pulls into his torso.

2276
02:49:49,228 --> 02:49:50,744
MARISHA: He's so fun to mess with.

2277
02:49:50,744 --> 02:49:52,975
LAURA: We are really shit at making friends.

2278
02:49:52,975 --> 02:50:00,744
TRAVIS: So I'm curious. While we're eating, would
you happen to tell us what our first objective

2279
02:50:00,744 --> 02:50:02,138
might be?

2280
02:50:02,138 --> 02:50:03,836
LAURA: He's going to show us.

2281
02:50:03,836 --> 02:50:06,295
TALIESIN: I think it's time to make our way in.

2282
02:50:06,295 --> 02:50:07,621
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm full.

2283
02:50:07,621 --> 02:50:10,530
ASHLEY: I'm going to walk over to Scanlan.
Scanlan!

2284
02:50:10,530 --> 02:50:11,666
SAM: What?

2285
02:50:11,666 --> 02:50:13,808
ASHLEY: I'm going to give this to you.

2286
02:50:13,808 --> 02:50:15,570
SAM: The Macarena?

2287
02:50:15,570 --> 02:50:18,824
ASHLEY: Yeah. Because I don't like performing.

2288
02:50:18,824 --> 02:50:20,635
SAM: You're really good at it.

2289
02:50:20,635 --> 02:50:28,702
ASHLEY: That's a lie. Just take this and maybe you
can charm some people with it. I don't know if

2290
02:50:28,702 --> 02:50:30,994
that's what it is, but I don't want him to have
it.

2291
02:50:30,994 --> 02:50:35,604
SAM: Thank you. I will try my best.

2292
02:50:35,604 --> 02:50:37,095
ASHLEY: All right. Let's go.

2293
02:50:37,095 --> 02:50:41,819
TALIESIN: Can't believe I wasted a natural 20 on
his-- Sorry. I'm good.

2294
02:50:41,819 --> 02:50:47,541
MATT: You guys finish your breakfast. The guards
come with you and escort you and your ally outside

2295
02:50:47,541 --> 02:50:50,390
the door. As you exit, the--

2296
02:50:50,390 --> 02:50:56,581
MARISHA: Wait. Take and roll up the painting, the
charcoal drawing that he did and put it in the Bag

2297
02:50:56,581 --> 02:50:57,785
of Holding.

2298
02:50:57,785 --> 02:51:05,256
LAURA: It's going to disappear as soon as we take
it out! Leave it in the mansion. That way it'll stay.

2299
02:51:05,256 --> 02:51:07,630
TALIESIN: It's from the mansion, so it'll stay in
the mansion.

2300
02:51:07,630 --> 02:51:09,294
MARISHA: Will it stay in the mansion?

2301
02:51:09,294 --> 02:51:13,082
MATT: You've tried taking things out of the
mansion, and they've turned to dust.

2302
02:51:13,082 --> 02:51:20,330
MARISHA: But I know things will also get ejected
from the mansion. Okay, I'll leave it.

2303
02:51:20,330 --> 02:51:29,995
MATT: You take it down, talk, put it back up. No
worries. As you guys exit the mansion, the dusk

2304
02:51:29,995 --> 02:51:37,828
light of the sky has not changed. You get the idea
here, at least since you've arrived, that there

2305
02:51:37,828 --> 02:51:41,700
has been no movement in the sun. You haven't even
seen the sun. The light source of dusk beyond the

2306
02:51:41,700 --> 02:51:50,212
distant mountains and horizon is stuck in the dusk
hour, with the threat and curl of midnight in the

2307
02:51:50,212 --> 02:51:56,086
opposite direction, the dark blue coming over the
horizon, unmoving. It also is raining gently.

2308
02:51:56,086 --> 02:52:04,267
There is a rather heavy cloud that has come over,
and it's not a terrible downpour, but a gentle

2309
02:52:04,267 --> 02:52:11,798
rainfall has been here for a while, and the floor
between the grasses is quite slushy as you step

2310
02:52:11,798 --> 02:52:13,881
out. (squelch)

2311
02:52:13,881 --> 02:52:16,761
SAM: Let's go to the city.

2312
02:52:16,761 --> 02:52:25,997
MARISHA: Vex? Should we be dressing for the
occasion? Should we put on our nice cloaks?

2313
02:52:25,997 --> 02:52:28,031
TALIESIN: We do have nice cloaks we could wear.

2314
02:52:28,031 --> 02:52:30,375
SAM: I think we're going to be sneaking in to
steal things.

2315
02:52:30,375 --> 02:52:32,799
LAURA: No, there's no way we could sneak in.

2316
02:52:32,799 --> 02:52:36,492
LIAM: We're going to go in and make introductions
and get settled and then figure out what the fuck

2317
02:52:36,492 --> 02:52:37,553
we're doing.

2318
02:52:37,553 --> 02:52:40,440
MARISHA: Yeah, cloak me.

2319
02:52:40,440 --> 02:52:43,021
LAURA: With what?

2320
02:52:43,021 --> 02:52:44,539
MARISHA: Our nice cloaks.

2321
02:52:44,539 --> 02:52:47,630
LAURA: He has some fancy cloaks, unless he's used
them all.

2322
02:52:47,630 --> 02:52:51,113
TALIESIN: Am I still made of wood, by the way?

2323
02:52:51,113 --> 02:52:53,951
MATT: No, that faded with the night's rest.

2324
02:52:53,951 --> 02:52:57,451
TRAVIS: I don't have fancy robes. I do have your
fancy winter stuff.

2325
02:52:57,451 --> 02:53:04,636
TALIESIN: It's raining. It's not like Hawaii rain.
It's rain, I would assume? It's not chilly, but cold.

2326
02:53:04,636 --> 02:53:09,958
MARISHA: I'll cloak up. Try and look like I made
some sort of effort.

2327
02:53:09,958 --> 02:53:12,635
TRAVIS: All right, Keyleth gets a cloak. Do you
want some nice shit?

2328
02:53:12,635 --> 02:53:13,719
TALIESIN: Oh, yes.

2329
02:53:13,719 --> 02:53:18,138
LIAM: I'm not changing anything.

2330
02:53:18,138 --> 02:53:22,272
SAM: How long will it take to get to the city from
where we are?

2331
02:53:22,272 --> 02:53:25,195
MATT: A few hours, maybe.

2332
02:53:25,195 --> 02:53:30,325
LAURA: Can't you craft something to keep the rain
off of us?

2333
02:53:30,325 --> 02:53:39,674
MARISHA: I'll do a little cantrip Gust over top of
us to make one of those air umbrellas that would

2334
02:53:39,674 --> 02:53:41,497
never work in real life.

2335
02:53:41,497 --> 02:53:45,914
MATT: Okay. You guys would have to get close
together to do that, but it's doable as a cantrip.

2336
02:53:45,914 --> 02:53:52,450
She keeps this general revolving sphere of wind
above that scatters most of the rain to the sides.

2337
02:53:52,450 --> 02:53:56,882
For the most part, Grog, you still get pretty damp
because of your size and difficulty, but most

2338
02:53:56,882 --> 02:54:00,766
everyone else can stay pretty dry as you cluster
together, walking through the grass.

2339
02:54:00,766 --> 02:54:11,314
You travel for another hour or so before the grass
towards the outskirts of the mountain range in the

2340
02:54:11,314 --> 02:54:20,604
city begins to slowly subside. It grows thinner
and shorter, and you come to a bit of marshland,

2341
02:54:20,604 --> 02:54:31,984
almost. Treeless, open marshland with little
bushes in clusters. Anything you guys want to--

2342
02:54:31,984 --> 02:54:40,420
LAURA: Perception check? See if I can see anything
moving ahead of us?

2343
02:54:40,420 --> 02:54:43,434
MATT: Okay, perception check.

2344
02:54:43,434 --> 02:54:47,398
LAURA: 29.

2345
02:54:47,450 --> 02:54:51,722
MATT: Okay. As you guys begin walking into the
marsh, you can see there are areas where it's

2346
02:54:51,722 --> 02:54:58,962
elevated mud patches, where it's very shallow
water, maybe an inch at most, and there are a few

2347
02:54:58,962 --> 02:55:04,250
different areas that get noticeably deep and
murky. You watch to avoid those elements. You're

2348
02:55:04,250 --> 02:55:09,265
not sure what might be beneath, if anything, but
you naturally move through this terrain carefully.

2349
02:55:09,265 --> 02:55:17,975
You do notice that, occasionally, upon this walk,
you see, different from the rest of the bushes and

2350
02:55:17,975 --> 02:55:33,080
pieces of terrain, these deep bluish purple sprout
leaves, almost like carrot tops, very leafy plant

2351
02:55:33,080 --> 02:55:40,057
top emerges in places, occasionally clusters of
two or three. There aren't a lot of them, but many

2352
02:55:40,057 --> 02:55:43,587
of them occur throughout the walk in this swampy
landscape.

2353
02:55:43,587 --> 02:55:45,983
LAURA: Garmelie? What are these?

2354
02:55:45,983 --> 02:55:58,171
MATT: "Oh, these are best to be avoided. They're
mandrake. Don't disturb them. Don't pull them out.

2355
02:55:58,171 --> 02:56:00,770
"Don't do anything with them."

2356
02:56:00,770 --> 02:56:03,140
MARISHA: Mandrakes? Oh, cool.

2357
02:56:03,140 --> 02:56:05,634
LAURA: Let's leave it.

2358
02:56:05,634 --> 02:56:07,251
TALIESIN: I've read things about those.

2359
02:56:07,251 --> 02:56:08,552
LAURA: What's this?

2360
02:56:08,552 --> 02:56:10,853
TALIESIN: That's just a thing. Just read it.

2361
02:56:10,853 --> 02:56:13,676
LIAM: It's a potted screaming baby. Leave them.

2362
02:56:13,676 --> 02:56:24,699
MATT: "Best left to the side." You guys make your
way through the marsh, occasionally passing by the

2363
02:56:24,699 --> 02:56:31,750
mandrake tops, until it begins to subside, the
marshland itself, and you come towards the base of

2364
02:56:31,750 --> 02:56:33,526
the city before you.

2365
02:56:33,526 --> 02:56:39,876
You see a massive, ivy-covered wall of jade-like
stone surrounding a dense cluster of towering

2366
02:56:39,876 --> 02:56:45,875
trees unlike those in any of the surrounding
forests or the one you left. It is an open plain,

2367
02:56:45,875 --> 02:56:52,932
and then within the city walls, there are trees
emerging many stories into the air. Trees that you

2368
02:56:52,932 --> 02:56:57,168
guys recognize have always been there. These trees
came with the city, and they're actually from the

2369
02:56:57,168 --> 02:57:00,162
Verdant Expanse where Syngorn usually resides.

2370
02:57:00,162 --> 02:57:10,083
As you walk closer, you can see large sealed gates
every so often along the outer wall. Every so

2371
02:57:10,083 --> 02:57:16,094
often, you see these gates embedded in the wall,
housing a massive emblem of a crescent moon

2372
02:57:16,094 --> 02:57:23,286
flanked by two trees over a deep cerulean stone
about two feet across. Twins, you know these as

2373
02:57:23,286 --> 02:57:31,587
the threshold crests. These are the enchanted
crests that enable the city to travel back and

2374
02:57:31,587 --> 02:57:38,137
forth between the Feywild, should it be necessary.
They're powerful, and they're rarely utilized, as

2375
02:57:38,137 --> 02:57:44,952
the journey is not always accurate. It seemingly
did so this time.

2376
02:57:44,952 --> 02:57:48,218
Make a perception check, guys.

2377
02:57:48,218 --> 02:57:50,553
TRAVIS: Everybody or just the twins?

2378
02:57:50,553 --> 02:57:52,354
MATT: Everybody who's paying attention.

2379
02:57:52,354 --> 02:57:56,791
SAM: I'm not. I'm reading.

2380
02:57:56,791 --> 02:58:00,312
LAURA: This is not woods anymore? This is not
forest? Is this marsh?

2381
02:58:00,312 --> 02:58:03,471
MATT: Just past marsh into flatland. 20?

2382
02:58:03,471 --> 02:58:04,384
MARISHA: 21.

2383
02:58:04,384 --> 02:58:05,778
LAURA: 21.

2384
02:58:05,778 --> 02:58:06,923
LIAM: 21.

2385
02:58:06,923 --> 02:58:07,770
ASHLEY: 15.

2386
02:58:07,770 --> 02:58:15,460
MATT: Okay. You guys continue towards the front of
the gate. There's nobody on the outside of it.

2387
02:58:15,460 --> 02:58:23,810
It's a solid, outside city. You can see white and
gray tower spires that streak up from inside, some

2388
02:58:23,810 --> 02:58:29,225
of which are entwined by trees that wrap around
the base and cluster around the center of the

2389
02:58:29,225 --> 02:58:35,279
tower's height, like its own canopy belt, if you
will.

2390
02:58:35,279 --> 02:58:42,122
As you get even closer still, you can see the
white walls themselves are replaced with heavy

2391
02:58:42,122 --> 02:58:52,195
gold and brass, gold-leaf edging across the top,
and at each one of the various nooks where the

2392
02:58:52,195 --> 02:58:58,825
solid stone walls are adjoined, this is a very
intricately carved and well-crafted wall. Probably

2393
02:58:58,825 --> 02:59:02,086
as part of the enchantment that was placed on it,
amongst others, to keep it defended.

2394
02:59:02,086 --> 02:59:17,430
You get about a hundred feet from the wall before
you, Vex, hear (scrape) a quick sound. You leap

2395
02:59:17,430 --> 02:59:25,884
back instinctually as all of you watch a series of
bolts and arrows (arrow impacts) across the floor

2396
02:59:25,884 --> 02:59:27,569
right in front of you.

2397
02:59:27,569 --> 02:59:29,105
SAM: That's exciting.

2398
02:59:29,105 --> 02:59:32,308
MATT: You all stop in place.

2399
02:59:32,308 --> 02:59:34,240
SAM: Should we attack?

2400
02:59:34,240 --> 02:59:38,784
MARISHA: I look up on the wall. Is it coming from
archers on the wall?

2401
02:59:38,784 --> 02:59:43,538
MATT: You can now see, up on the wall, dozens of
figures atop, with longbows, and some with

2402
02:59:43,538 --> 02:59:46,657
crossbows, drawn and nocked, trained on all of
you.

2403
02:59:46,657 --> 02:59:54,964
LAURA: I take my hood down. You know us. We're
here to see my father.

2404
02:59:54,964 --> 03:00:00,596
MATT: There's a pause, and they're still 100 feet
away from you. One of the voices says,

2405
03:00:00,596 --> 03:00:04,820
"Who is <i>us,</i> if I might ask?"

2406
03:00:04,820 --> 03:00:09,454
LAURA: The twins. Vex'ahlia and Vax'ildan.

2407
03:00:09,454 --> 03:00:11,739
LIAM: Syldor's children.

2408
03:00:11,739 --> 03:00:21,184
MATT: There's a little bit of a conversation. You
see a couple of figures disappear behind the wall.

2409
03:00:21,184 --> 03:00:25,565
About five minutes pass, and as you guys get a
little fidgety or one of you makes a swift

2410
03:00:25,565 --> 03:00:32,657
movement, you can see the drawn bows tense up.
They're trained on any movement you guys give at

2411
03:00:32,657 --> 03:00:37,730
this moment. As time passes, an individual steps
up to the top of the wall, adorned in similar

2412
03:00:37,730 --> 03:00:46,753
Syngorian armor, but the helmet is taken off, and
you see a woman with deep crimson hair braided to

2413
03:00:46,753 --> 03:00:56,987
one side and shaved on the other. She steps up and
looks out. "Vex'ahlia. Vax'ildan."

2414
03:00:56,987 --> 03:01:01,583
LAURA: Do we know who she is?

2415
03:01:01,583 --> 03:01:06,630
MATT: "The Vessar twins return. Do I know why?
What is your business here in Syngorn?"

2416
03:01:06,630 --> 03:01:13,610
LAURA: We came to speak to our father.

2417
03:01:13,610 --> 03:01:16,991
MATT: "And the rest of your company?"

2418
03:01:16,991 --> 03:01:19,512
LIAM: They're with us.

2419
03:01:19,512 --> 03:01:23,599
MATT: Make a persuasion check, both of you.

2420
03:01:23,599 --> 03:01:30,575
LIAM: 20.

2421
03:01:30,575 --> 03:01:38,559
LAURA: 14. I'll stop using that one tonight.

2422
03:01:38,559 --> 03:01:48,800
MATT: "Come forth to the gate. Relieve your
arrows, please." The guards all take their bows

2423
03:01:48,800 --> 03:01:54,931
off of you and release the tension in the strings.
The woman turns and steps off the wall again. You

2424
03:01:54,931 --> 03:01:59,759
can see the very front gate, the front of the
wall, opens ever so slightly, about a five-foot

2425
03:01:59,759 --> 03:02:01,126
gap left.

2426
03:02:01,126 --> 03:02:09,898
LIAM: Everybody, let my sister and I do the
talking for a minute. Thank you. I scoop up my

2427
03:02:09,898 --> 03:02:16,787
sister's hand, down by my side, and walk forward.

2428
03:02:16,787 --> 03:02:21,809
MATT: As you guys walk single file, continuing
towards the city, your satyr friend stays in the

2429
03:02:21,809 --> 03:02:33,162
very back behind you, clutching. (whimpering) As
you glance back, Grog, he's not there.

2430
03:02:33,162 --> 03:02:38,537
LAURA: Can you still feel him? Oh, sorry.

2431
03:02:38,537 --> 03:02:41,261
TRAVIS: Can I reach down to where he was?

2432
03:02:41,261 --> 03:02:45,772
MATT: Still tugging, he's holding on to you, but
has lost visibility.

2433
03:02:45,772 --> 03:02:47,976
TRAVIS: Clever little spider monkey.

2434
03:02:47,976 --> 03:02:54,934
MATT: As you guys approach, there waiting at the
side of the gate within are about ten guards and

2435
03:02:54,934 --> 03:03:01,922
this individual. She looks a little more
battle-hardened and wasn't elevated before, was

2436
03:03:01,922 --> 03:03:07,099
just one of the guards when you were children, but
this is Iova.

2437
03:03:07,099 --> 03:03:17,786
Now Watcher Iova, the Watchers which guard the
wall. She appears to be of an elevated status

2438
03:03:17,786 --> 03:03:23,859
within the Watchers of Syngorn. As you approach,
she lowers her head in a respectful bow, but still

2439
03:03:23,859 --> 03:03:29,260
not breaking eye contact, and has an aloof and
distanced expression.

2440
03:03:29,260 --> 03:03:38,356
LAURA: Watcher Iova. Nice to see you have elevated
yourself.

2441
03:03:38,356 --> 03:03:45,033
MATT: "Time has passed since you were finding your
own path. Surprised to see you return here,

2442
03:03:45,033 --> 03:03:48,588
"especially so far from the material realms."

2443
03:03:48,588 --> 03:03:54,248
LIAM: Then you can imagine there is great cause
for us to be here.

2444
03:03:54,248 --> 03:03:57,437
MATT: "Is your father aware of your arrival?"

2445
03:03:57,437 --> 03:03:59,342
LAURA: No.

2446
03:03:59,342 --> 03:04:13,845
MATT: "He is now. You and your guests will be
watched. You will be followed, until otherwise

2447
03:04:13,845 --> 03:04:20,325
"given proof and permission from individuals higher
than my station within the city, preferably your father."

2448
03:04:20,325 --> 03:04:23,806
LAURA: I would expect nothing less.

2449
03:04:23,806 --> 03:04:32,905
MATT: "Now, go. And welcome to Syngorn." She turns
around, puts her helmet on, and half the guard

2450
03:04:32,905 --> 03:04:37,511
walk away, while another six remain behind,
keeping watch.

2451
03:04:37,511 --> 03:04:41,175
TALIESIN: Interesting.

2452
03:04:41,175 --> 03:04:43,597
MARISHA: Not quite a warm welcome.

2453
03:04:43,597 --> 03:04:45,344
TALIESIN: I wouldn't expect one.

2454
03:04:45,344 --> 03:04:51,052
LAURA: I guess we should probably make our way
straight to-- so we can have free rein.

2455
03:04:51,052 --> 03:04:54,383
LIAM: I motion for the rest to come up behind.

2456
03:04:54,383 --> 03:04:59,103
MATT: As the rest of you approach and find your
way within the city walls, you're met with an

2457
03:04:59,103 --> 03:05:04,678
astounding cityscape. Hundreds of homes and
buildings and sanctuaries, formed with a natural

2458
03:05:04,678 --> 03:05:10,363
grace and keen architectural mind as to seem
almost grown from the trees and earth themselves.

2459
03:05:10,363 --> 03:05:15,725
Upon closer look and a nearby inspection, you can
see the craftsmanship, but from a distance, it's

2460
03:05:15,725 --> 03:05:22,077
almost like they were born from the materials,
than they were built or crafted. You can see

2461
03:05:22,077 --> 03:05:27,872
distant magical lantern light shines all across
the city, like the start of a glittering snowfall,

2462
03:05:27,872 --> 03:05:33,620
as the rest of the streets themselves are ever lit
by these little shining beacons.

2463
03:05:33,620 --> 03:05:40,536
The center of the ageless place is divided by a
grand lake of pure blue water, a roiling mist

2464
03:05:40,536 --> 03:05:46,325
drifting across the surface, obscuring the view of
boats currently on the surface of the water. You

2465
03:05:46,325 --> 03:05:51,372
do notice a large military presence within the
city, as the armored guard of Syngorn, these

2466
03:05:51,372 --> 03:05:56,858
individuals, the armored military force known as
the Verdant Guard, are walking throughout the

2467
03:05:56,858 --> 03:06:02,456
city. Not with a hurried pace, but there is a
general tension in the air, far more than you've

2468
03:06:02,456 --> 03:06:08,343
ever seen in all the years that you did spend in
your youth within Syngorn. That's where we'll

2469
03:06:08,343 --> 03:06:09,730
finish our session for the evening.

2470
03:06:09,730 --> 03:06:15,663
LAURA: Shit.

2471
03:06:15,663 --> 03:06:17,292
ASHLEY: I felt like we were just getting started.

2472
03:06:17,292 --> 03:06:18,855
MATT: It's 10:30, though.

2473
03:06:18,855 --> 03:06:20,161
ASHLEY: How?

2474
03:06:20,161 --> 03:06:23,422
LAURA: I guess you just have to fly in next week,
too!

2475
03:06:23,422 --> 03:06:28,487
ASHLEY: I wish I could.

2476
03:06:28,487 --> 03:06:37,453
MATT: As I look down and once again notice my Tick
Spoons shirt I've had on the entire evening, my

2477
03:06:37,453 --> 03:06:39,614
overshirt seems to have been shortening it to--

2478
03:06:39,614 --> 03:06:40,960
TRAVIS: Poon!

2479
03:06:40,960 --> 03:06:42,683
ASHLEY: Oh, I noticed.

2480
03:06:42,683 --> 03:06:45,896
MATT: Or even better--

2481
03:06:45,896 --> 03:06:47,315
MARISHA: Poo!

2482
03:06:47,315 --> 03:06:50,631
LAURA: Well, that's okay. It says Spoon.

2483
03:06:50,631 --> 03:07:01,105
MATT: Spoon! It's intended to be. It all works
fine. Both ways it's the new Scanlan shirt. Poon

2484
03:07:01,105 --> 03:07:08,210
and poo! Scanlan Shorthalt. Autobiography. Well,
great, guys! Thank you so much. We'll be picking

2485
03:07:08,210 --> 03:07:13,366
up the next length of this journey in the reunion
of Vex and Vax with their father, Syldor Vessar.

2486
03:07:13,366 --> 03:07:18,358
MARISHA: Syldor. Such a dipshit.

2487
03:07:18,358 --> 03:07:20,971
TRAVIS: Oh shit. At the live show.

2488
03:07:20,971 --> 03:07:24,308
LIAM: Live show, no pressure.

2489
03:07:24,308 --> 03:07:26,825
TALIESIN: I am so excited.

2490
03:07:26,825 --> 03:07:31,027
MATT: And you did notice that they were referred
to as the Vessar twins.

2491
03:07:31,027 --> 03:07:32,901
TRAVIS: Vessar twins?

2492
03:07:32,901 --> 03:07:34,957
SAM: What does that even mean?

2493
03:07:34,957 --> 03:07:37,620
LAURA: That's our dad's stupid last name.

2494
03:07:37,620 --> 03:07:42,410
SAM: Vessar? Vax and Vex Vessar?

2495
03:07:42,410 --> 03:07:54,248
MATT: Whether they use the name, that's up to
them, and I don't think that they do. But that it

2496
03:07:54,248 --> 03:08:00,832
is. All right, folks, we'll see you guys, some of
you, live at the-- well, we'll see you all live

2497
03:08:00,832 --> 03:08:03,035
next week, but some of you we'll see at the actual
venue in person.

2498
03:08:03,035 --> 03:08:04,274
TRAVIS: Thank you to Loot Crate.

2499
03:08:04,274 --> 03:08:06,880
MATT: You guys are awesome.

2500
03:08:06,880 --> 03:08:08,380
TRAVIS: One day left for Joe Mad.

2501
03:08:08,380 --> 03:08:18,676
LAURA: (Dragon Ball Z war cry) There we go.

2502
03:08:18,676 --> 03:08:25,845
MATT: That's okay. Ashley, I'm glad you could join
us.

2503
03:08:25,845 --> 03:08:29,070
TRAVIS: Yay Ashley!

2504
03:08:29,070 --> 03:08:33,725
MATT: And we'll see you guys next week. Is it
Thursday yet?
