NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.137 --> 00:00:03.870
MATT: Hello! My name is Matthew Mercer. I'm a
voice actor and the dungeon master for Critical

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.751
Role here at Geek &amp; Sundry, and while we may have
touched on it in the past, today's GMing Tips is

00:00:08.751 --> 00:00:14.270
going more in depth about the idea of customizing
your creatures and characters for encounters.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:19.981
[music]

00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:24.131
Whether you're running a party sized larger or
smaller than the system was actually balanced for,

00:00:24.131 --> 00:00:29.261
or you want to create your own strange new beasts,
or have veteran players who have memorized the

00:00:29.261 --> 00:00:32.490
entire Monster Manual and you still want to
surprise them, there's a lot of good fun to be had in

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.009
occasionally customizing the creatures you use in
your campaign. I'll be using mostly Dungeons and

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:41.360
Dragons examples here, especially Fifth Edition,
but the general ideas and functions work for

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.299
pretty much any gaming system out there.

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:48.991
So, for smaller party sizes of one to three
players, first off, consider the party makeup. Do

00:00:48.991 --> 00:00:52.733
they have a decent healer? Do they have a lot of
damage-dealers without a lot of defensive

00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:56.609
capabilities? You want to make sure you don't
create encounters or customize creatures or put

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:01.098
creatures in that will wipe them out immediately
without some of those usual party dynamic

00:01:01.158 --> 00:01:04.381
abilities. But you might want to consider
adjusting some creatures to have attacks that

00:01:04.381 --> 00:01:09.701
inflict conditions over just direct damage.
Perhaps a smuggler throws sand as an attack that

00:01:09.701 --> 00:01:13.901
blinds a player until they clear their eyes as an
action. You could add a trip attack to some

00:01:13.901 --> 00:01:18.882
combatants that knocks a target prone. Maybe a
direwolf has a howl that can instill the

00:01:18.882 --> 00:01:22.910
Frightened condition on a nearby target. These are
examples of attacks that heighten the sense of

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.271
danger without directly overwhelming a small party
with damage.

00:01:26.271 --> 00:01:31.162
And if you want to add a powerful enemy for story
flavor, but it could clean up against them? Scale

00:01:31.162 --> 00:01:35.569
down a number of statistics to bring it a little
closer to the party level. Lowering HP by a

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:39.412
fraction could certainly help, but the general
defenses across the board can also take a little

00:01:39.412 --> 00:01:44.480
hit, such as a reduction of saving throws, spell
DC, and armor class. Gauge which enemies at their

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.091
level seem to give them a tough fight, and adjust
your boss foe to be comparable, if a bit nastier.

00:01:49.091 --> 00:01:51.254
Because nastier's always fun.

00:01:51.254 --> 00:01:56.032
Now, attacks that can affect and lock down the
entire smaller party can lead to an unfair TPK if

00:01:56.032 --> 00:02:00.284
you aren't careful. Consider adjusting some of
these abilities to affect a smaller line or cone

00:02:00.284 --> 00:02:05.753
area, or perhaps reduce the Paralysis status it
inflicts to just Restrained, if most or all can be

00:02:05.753 --> 00:02:07.713
hit at once. Just in case.

00:02:07.713 --> 00:02:12.173
You can even instill a story reason for the
creature's weakened state, leaving a fear of the

00:02:12.173 --> 00:02:16.064
healthy version to eventually come. (evil cackle)

00:02:16.064 --> 00:02:22.302
For larger party sizes of six, seven-plus players,
adding more hit points can help, but it isn't

00:02:22.302 --> 00:02:27.483
always the answer. Just adding more HP to a foe
only drags out a less-than-dynamic fight if you

00:02:27.483 --> 00:02:30.822
don't find other ways to make the battle more
interesting for the larger scope of combatants.

00:02:30.822 --> 00:02:34.205
Here are a few ways that you can up the ante
without dragging out the battle too much longer

00:02:34.205 --> 00:02:35.753
than it's intended to be.

00:02:35.753 --> 00:02:39.043
So for larger party sizes, that usually means
fewer rounds of combat, so make sure those rounds

00:02:39.043 --> 00:02:44.193
hurt. Consider a small bump in damage to most
creatures. If it's a solo or small number of

00:02:44.193 --> 00:02:49.293
villains, perhaps customize existing attacks or
adding a new one that can affect multiple PCs. A

00:02:49.293 --> 00:02:54.394
sweeping cleave that hits all creatures adjacent
to them, or a slamming tail attack that hits

00:02:54.394 --> 00:02:59.045
everything in a 15-foot line. An arcane ability
that summons up crushing vines from the ground in

00:02:59.045 --> 00:03:03.953
a 20-foot radius, grappling and damaging those
caught in it. Stuff like that.

00:03:03.953 --> 00:03:09.073
This allows your overwhelmed monster to keep up
with the onslaught of many, many combatants around

00:03:09.073 --> 00:03:13.423
them. And with that many PCs in the field,
mobility for creatures can also be difficult.

00:03:13.423 --> 00:03:18.111
Consider abilities that can allow it to escape or more
quickly move about without a storm of attacks of

00:03:18.111 --> 00:03:22.294
opportunity tearing its head off. Perhaps have an
attack ability that also pushes the target back

00:03:22.294 --> 00:03:27.465
ten feet, now allowing them to move about safely.
Or a move ability that lets them teleport or leap

00:03:27.465 --> 00:03:29.562
30 feet without fear of retaliation.

00:03:29.562 --> 00:03:35.143
Here's also some fun general tweaks you could
possibly add to it as well to liven up the combat.

00:03:35.143 --> 00:03:39.222
You can implement damage milestones for the
creature, which means when a foe gets below a

00:03:39.222 --> 00:03:42.982
certain threshold of damage, they gain new
abilities, or transform, like some crazy video

00:03:42.982 --> 00:03:47.773
game boss fight. They begin to regenerate or grow
a new limb, allowing additional attacks, or they

00:03:47.773 --> 00:03:53.524
enrage and deal even more damage per hit while the
combat drags out. Abilities that can add or change

00:03:53.524 --> 00:03:57.562
the terrain of the battlefield are also a lot of
fun. A salamander who leaves an ever-burning trail

00:03:57.562 --> 00:04:01.249
in their path when they walk, and anyone who
crosses that previously walked path now bursts

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:03.201
into flame and takes damage.

00:04:03.201 --> 00:04:07.232
You can also implement minor lair actions for
non-solo encounters. These are all experimental

00:04:07.232 --> 00:04:12.087
ideas and mistakes will be made and you'll learn
from them to find the real balance for the game.

00:04:12.087 --> 00:04:16.892
That's part of the fun of running these larger or
smaller games. I would recommend erring on the

00:04:16.892 --> 00:04:22.063
less and then scale higher as you progress. That
might help prevent an unintentional TPK on your

00:04:22.063 --> 00:04:25.083
party when you were in the middle of just trying
to get them in the mood.

00:04:25.083 --> 00:04:28.232
Anyway, hope you enjoyed and learned something
from the episode. You will see me on other

00:04:28.232 --> 00:04:32.495
episodes of GM Tips here on GeekandSundry.com.
I'll see you guys on the internet.
