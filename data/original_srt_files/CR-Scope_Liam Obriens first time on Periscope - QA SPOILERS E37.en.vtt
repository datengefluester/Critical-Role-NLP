NOTE Paragraph

00:00:07.498 --> 00:00:15.895
LIAM: Oh jeez, is this already going? This is my
first Periscope and I'm at the end of a long day.

00:00:16.306 --> 00:00:23.134
I've been directing some junk. I'm deep in the
bowels of-- hi everybody-- Warner Brothers. I've

00:00:23.134 --> 00:00:31.356
been working on a game. It's a particularly dense
one, not your typical grenade, get down. Hi

00:00:31.356 --> 00:00:43.347
everybody. Hi. Oh, hi. Hi. "Shout hair, bro?" Hmm.
I barely know how Periscope works. I've jumped

00:00:43.347 --> 00:00:55.496
into a few other people's a little bit. I am
pooped, man, every Friday. Oh. Thanks for the hair

00:00:55.496 --> 00:01:01.768
compliment and the podcast compliment. I can't
touch your butt through the screen, Joey

00:01:01.768 --> 00:01:16.385
Murenhale. Thank you. Yeah, the glasses and the
tired are part of the Friday D&D hangover, which

00:01:16.385 --> 00:01:22.396
just means we were up super late in California,
and then I got to get my butt out of bed at five

00:01:22.396 --> 00:01:29.586
in the morning. I'm basically up at five every day
with little exception-- all in a day's work,

00:01:29.586 --> 00:01:35.996
yeah-- to get my kids to school. I won't stay on
too long, guys, I'm going to stay for like 15

00:01:35.996 --> 00:01:42.508
minutes. We'll see if I think of things to say. If
you have questions, throw real questions at me.

00:01:42.508 --> 00:01:51.638
"Gollum's on TV behind me while watching." (Gollum
voice) Nasty! (Liam voice) Was I tired last night

00:01:51.638 --> 00:02:00.855
on Critical Role? Yeah, I was tired last night. I
am juggling a lot, guys. I won't go into what, but

00:02:00.855 --> 00:02:06.397
I juggle a lot. Work, and all that personal crud.
I'm not going to get into it, but that's all still

00:02:06.397 --> 00:02:17.417
going on. You know, muddling along. I'm okay. I'm
good. Work is good. The D&D is good. The public

00:02:17.417 --> 00:02:25.625
face of my shit is all great. It's just, you know,
family stuff, which all of us-- you, me everybody--

00:02:25.625 --> 00:02:32.505
has to deal with. Holy cow, the questions are
filling up my whole face. Are there any questions

00:02:32.505 --> 00:02:38.113
in here? "We need to know: are you going to
address--" Nah. I'll just let that play out in the

00:02:38.393 --> 00:02:44.300
show. I mean, I really, seriously, have no idea.
None of us really know where we're going on the

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:53.921
show-- hi Meghan-- what direction. I know Matt has
got places where we could go, but it's not like we

00:02:53.921 --> 00:02:58.791
had a meeting and said, "Okay, we're going to go
and explore Grog's background." Which I hope we

00:02:58.791 --> 00:03:05.821
do. We really don't know where we're going. I
don't know if I'm getting it on with Gilmore. I

00:03:05.821 --> 00:03:13.290
don't know. I don't know any of that. We just make
it up as we go along. "What's working for Blizzard

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.910
"like?" Yeah, I'm going to start answering some
questions. Working for Blizzard's great. Spin

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:26.678
around. I have been working for Blizzard for a
decade. To get asked to direct and be part of the

00:03:26.976 --> 00:03:33.266
family that way is, I don't know, it was a
blessing. They invited me down to the studio. I've

00:03:33.266 --> 00:03:38.108
worked on the game for almost a decade and to go
the studio for the first time ever and see-- not

00:03:38.108 --> 00:03:44.658
the studio, Blizzard, south of us-- to see all the
statues and the stuff on the walls and the art and

00:03:44.658 --> 00:03:55.537
just everything that they work on. It's no wonder
why they're as successful as they are because of

00:03:55.537 --> 00:04:03.696
the attention and the love and the care. Oh,
somebody said, single word, "Fuck." Let me see.

00:04:03.696 --> 00:04:14.827
"Order: 1886 as Finley." Yeah, thank you that was
fun to do. These are moving fast. "I grew up

00:04:14.827 --> 00:04:19.626
"Blizzard thanks to my bird father." I don't know
what that means. "Come out to Melbourne Comic

00:04:19.626 --> 00:04:25.977
"Con!" We would love to. The way that all works, I
think you've heard this before-- hey, AC_Mickey--

00:04:25.977 --> 00:04:31.534
is you guys tell the convention that you're
interested in having us at the convention. If

00:04:31.887 --> 00:04:40.757
enough of you, in a friendly way, say, "We need
Sam Riegel in Australia!" then they'll ask. Tiger,

00:04:40.757 --> 00:04:49.135
"Top three D&D classes." What are the three that I
think are the best? Or my favorite? I don't know.

00:04:49.135 --> 00:04:59.323
I like rogues in all kinds of games. I like magic
users. I don't know. I think if Vax ever kicks the

00:04:59.323 --> 00:05:08.547
bucket, and by the way, I see a lot. Some guys are
saying that Vax'ildan, or me, or both of us,

00:05:08.547 --> 00:05:14.173
whatever that means, has a death wish. I don't. I
hope he never dies. I love playing him. I think if

00:05:14.173 --> 00:05:20.085
he ever does get flattened, then I'll probably do
something magicky, but I don't know. I did see

00:05:20.085 --> 00:05:31.356
Star Wars and enjoyed it because it was really
well made. God, I'm tired. "Liam, what would you

00:05:31.356 --> 00:05:41.065
"hope to accomplish if Matt does your backstory
like he did Percy?" The twins have a sad-sack

00:05:41.065 --> 00:05:45.885
story, but I don't feel like it's a special story.
They're just a couple of unwanted kids. They're

00:05:45.885 --> 00:05:54.016
not-- Their mother's gone. I don't think she's
squirrelled away somewhere, secretly going to pop

00:05:54.016 --> 00:06:03.763
up. I think she's gone. We'll see. Their father is
not royalty. He's got a good position. They're

00:06:03.763 --> 00:06:10.195
just a couple of unwanted kids. They're not
princes, they're not royalty, they have no special

00:06:10.195 --> 00:06:16.295
future. I think I've always liked that. They're
just a couple of deadenders. "You had a blue thing

00:06:16.295 --> 00:06:29.466
on your profile. Could you tell me--" I lost it.
It's gone. Let's see. "Any more All Work No Play?"

00:06:29.466 --> 00:06:36.035
Yeah, the podcast is not dead. It has slowed down.
When Sam and I started that, we were really busy,

00:06:36.334 --> 00:06:48.387
and now we're ridiculously busy. "What--" Let me
see. Dub a dub a dub a. I can't stop talking.

00:06:48.387 --> 00:06:53.876
Isn't that deal? You have to keep saying stuff.
"We need an adventures in babysitting arc with

00:06:53.876 --> 00:06:59.913
"your half-sister." You have just dated yourself,
my friend. I know what that means, but I'm pretty

00:06:59.913 --> 00:07:08.965
sure half the audience doesn't. What else? "Vox
Machina's ages?" I don't know everybody's ages. I

00:07:08.965 --> 00:07:16.324
think what Laura and I have said for the twins is
they're 27. I don't know that I am popular.

00:07:16.324 --> 00:07:23.326
Someone's asking me why I'm so popular. I was
passed over in Spin the Bottle when I was 12, so I

00:07:23.606 --> 00:07:34.626
never really felt like the popular kid. I'm just
still the same geek I've always been. GMing for

00:07:34.626 --> 00:07:40.866
the kids is good. My son loves it. He is totally
addicted. We don't get to play that much because

00:07:40.866 --> 00:07:45.525
it takes a lot of planning. I don't know how Matt
does it for a nuanced, complicated way for a bunch

00:07:45.525 --> 00:07:52.745
of adults and thousands of people. Just finding
the time to prepare for three nine year olds I

00:07:52.745 --> 00:07:59.215
find challenging. They love it. My daughter,
Romper Stomper, is starting to sniff around about

00:07:59.215 --> 00:08:05.936
it. I've started talking to her about the druid
that she wants to make named Oak. My son has a

00:08:05.936 --> 00:08:12.495
couple characters, but his main one that he plays
is also a druid. Not my influence, that's just

00:08:12.495 --> 00:08:19.917
what they both gravitated towards. The ongoing
campaign that my son does, he plays a half-elven

00:08:19.917 --> 00:08:26.846
druid, and then his two friends are both
dragonborns. He's got a big, bulky, red dragonborn

00:08:26.846 --> 00:08:34.816
who is played by his red headed friend from
school. The other one is a bronze dragonborn

00:08:34.816 --> 00:08:42.515
rogue. We've only played four games. Plus for my
son's birthday, we did a big extravaganza blowout,

00:08:42.515 --> 00:08:47.426
so I guess five games total. "How do you feel
about being a geek or nerd being cool now?" It's

00:08:47.426 --> 00:08:55.555
good because it means we have an easier time.
"What's it been like introducing your kids to nerd

00:08:55.555 --> 00:09:00.417
"stuff you love? Lord of the Rings especially."
That's great. I'm rereading The Hobbit with my son

00:09:00.417 --> 00:09:06.407
at bedtime. It's our fourth go-through of the
book. He asked for it this time. Obviously, I

00:09:06.407 --> 00:09:11.629
introduced it to him, and I suggested it a second
time. The third and fourth time, he asked for it.

00:09:12.019 --> 00:09:19.069
"What did you voice Gollum in?" I've done Gollum
in two or three or four games at this point, the

00:09:19.069 --> 00:09:22.761
main one being Shadow of Mordor, which came out a
couple of years ago. I did the voice, but I also

00:09:22.761 --> 00:09:27.937
did the performance capture for it, too. I put on
the monkey suit with the nubblies all over it,

00:09:27.937 --> 00:09:37.810
crawled around and bruised my knees up for glory.
I've been in love with The Hobbit since I was, I

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:48.990
don't know, 12 or 13. Really, actually, the
animated film of The Hobbit a little bit

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:55.769
contributed to me getting into acting. Gollum in
that is very different than the Gollum we know

00:09:55.769 --> 00:10:03.341
from the movies today. I started aping and
mirroring that Gollum, which led me to into doing

00:10:03.341 --> 00:10:16.652
drama in high school. So to get put on the Sméagol
suit was a big deal for me. Very big deal for me.

00:10:16.652 --> 00:10:22.553
"Favorite character to voice?" I don't have one.
Gollum is one of them, I've always loved doing

00:10:22.821 --> 00:10:28.471
Gaara. (Gaara voice) He's easier to do now that
he's chilled out. (Liam voice) He used to be a

00:10:28.471 --> 00:10:36.973
rage monkey, but now he's calm. I love
Nightcrawler. What else? Illidan is always fun to

00:10:36.973 --> 00:10:44.610
do. Let's see. I want to stay for another five
minutes, guy. Everyone's asking me about a blue

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:49.812
thing in my profile. I don't know what you guys
mean. "Any advice for aspiring voice actors?" Just

00:10:49.812 --> 00:10:58.201
study acting, guys. You can specialize later, but
you can't make the choice to specialize if you're

00:10:58.201 --> 00:11:04.641
not acting in general. So find community theaters
in your neighborhood, or see if your community

00:11:04.641 --> 00:11:12.053
college or high school has drama clubs and start
doing it. Then if you feel like you enjoy it or

00:11:12.053 --> 00:11:15.521
have a knack for it, you can then figure out where
to go from there. You basically have to start.

00:11:15.521 --> 00:11:24.581
Let's see. Dub a dub a. I haven't done musical
theater. I love musical theater, but I haven't

00:11:24.581 --> 00:11:30.402
done it since high school. It's like the Olympics
for me; it's people doing things I can't do.

00:11:30.402 --> 00:11:38.730
(Irish accent) "Can you give me your best Irish
accent?" I'm not exactly sure what you want me to

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:50.559
say. What could I do? Oh, I'll tell you a joke.
How about a joke, guys? Seamus is walking through

00:11:50.559 --> 00:11:57.251
fields of Ireland with his son, Declan. He points
off into the distance and says, "Declan." "Yeah,

00:11:57.251 --> 00:12:05.802
"Da?" "Do you see that bridge over there?" "I do,
Da!" "I spent two weeks of me life working on that

00:12:05.802 --> 00:12:13.381
"bridge. I put my blood, sweat, and tears into it.
Do they call me Seamus the Bridge Builder? No."

00:12:13.381 --> 00:12:20.751
They walk on for a while. Seamus points out and
says, "Declan? Do you see that church over there?"

00:12:20.751 --> 00:12:29.842
"I do, Da!" "That church took me three months to
build. I did it meself. I put every ounce of blood

00:12:29.842 --> 00:12:39.012
"and sweat and love and care into it. Months,
Declan! Do they call me Seamus the Church Builder?

00:12:39.012 --> 00:12:56.431
No. But you fuck one fucking goat!" (Liam voice)
Joke's over. I missed that one. "Favorite

00:12:56.431 --> 00:13:04.942
Shakespeare play?" Oh, that's hard. I like Hamlet.
I like Julius Caesar. I like Twelfth Night a lot.

00:13:04.942 --> 00:13:11.912
I played Juliet in a four man version of Romeo and
Juliet, which is one of my favorite roles that

00:13:11.912 --> 00:13:24.881
I've ever played. I'd love to do theater. I've
talked about this before. There's not a ton-- it's

00:13:24.881 --> 00:13:31.711
harder to make a living just in the theater alone,
and I dug around in theater for many years. But

00:13:31.711 --> 00:13:35.658
once I started having a family and having to buy
diapers, put food on the table and stuff, I

00:13:36.005 --> 00:13:45.457
gravitated towards all of this stuff, which was
vomiting itself at me. That's no small potatoes.

00:13:45.457 --> 00:13:50.243
I'm very happy about it. You're about to graduate
from Tisch, really scared about your future. "Did

00:13:50.574 --> 00:13:59.559
"it happen to you? Any advice?" Yes. I graduated
from Tisch, so hi, dude. I don't know. Nobody

00:13:59.559 --> 00:14:04.032
knows what they're doing. No adult, no kid, no one
knows what they're doing. I don't know how I got

00:14:04.032 --> 00:14:09.324
here. I'm one of the few actors-- People ask me
how to get into voice acting. I honestly don't

00:14:09.324 --> 00:14:17.070
know. Really all you can do it study to be an
actor and look for opportunities, move to where

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:26.242
the work is, and keep at it. Good luck, though!
Tisch does give you a good education. New York

00:14:26.242 --> 00:14:33.853
City is a good place to cut your teeth. I'm going
to pick-- I got to hit the road-- I'll pick five

00:14:33.853 --> 00:14:42.153
questions and give shorter answers. Let me see.
Yes, my degree was in acting. I went to New York

00:14:42.153 --> 00:14:47.932
University, Tisch School of the Arts to study
acting. Foolishly squeezed it all into three years

00:14:47.932 --> 00:14:55.109
because I thought I had to get out there. Started
working pretty immediately once I got out, so that

00:14:55.109 --> 00:15:12.770
was good. I'm just looking for a question to pick.
Humida humida humida. Come on, throw something at

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:19.903
me. Let me see. "Have you other played RPGs other
than D&D?" I'm going to assume you mean tabletop

00:15:19.903 --> 00:15:25.582
because obviously when I have time, I play video
games. I'm playing Fallout now. I have a big game

00:15:25.582 --> 00:15:32.131
collection that I don't get to play that much.
I've been a gamer for 15 years or longer, probably

00:15:32.131 --> 00:15:39.070
longer. Yeah, because I had Atari and all that. I
assume you're asking me about tabletop, so not

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:45.654
since high school. When I was in high school, I
did play Advanced Dungeons & Dragons. I played--

00:15:45.654 --> 00:15:52.660
really, I just read. I think just read and made
characters for Rifts, which is a big, hodge-podge,

00:15:52.660 --> 00:16:01.221
sci fi-magic amalgam. Someone led me through
Shadowrun for one game. I barely remember it. I

00:16:01.221 --> 00:16:08.582
did Cyberpunk for one summer. My cousin in upstate
New York ran a game and I played a lady rock and

00:16:08.582 --> 00:16:19.394
roll star. My favorite alcoholic beverage is
probably Irish whiskey. When I was in Ireland, my

00:16:19.702 --> 00:16:27.321
favorite thing to get was Bushmills whiskey served
as a hot toddy and they called it a Hot Bush which

00:16:27.321 --> 00:16:37.520
was just heated whiskey with sugar and a lemon in
it and cloves. Coming in from the rain and the

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:45.833
cold, it was the best. No, no scotch for me.
Occasionally, if someone gives it to me. I feel

00:16:45.833 --> 00:16:53.740
like I'm connecting to my Irish roots with the
whiskey. Last question. I'm going to read a couple

00:16:53.740 --> 00:17:06.351
and go with it. Let me see here. Favorite Critical
Role session. What was my favorite Critical Role

00:17:06.351 --> 00:17:18.400
session? My favorite moments, I mean, we've been
doing it for over a hundred hours. Oh boy.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:26.160
Favorite Critical Role moments. I mean, I loved
everything that happened with the Briarwoods when

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:41.001
I stepped into the shit and getting away. And
biting it. Spilling all the beans on the table

00:17:41.001 --> 00:17:48.321
because I thought that was probably my only chance
to do it. So that was great. I'm a big Scanlan

00:17:48.321 --> 00:18:00.602
fan, so I love-- highlight is Sam, letting Sam
bust me up week after week. Let me see. The

00:18:00.602 --> 00:18:05.961
beholder fight was great. Oh! But better than the
beholder fight for me was us sneaking in and

00:18:05.961 --> 00:18:14.823
taking out the illithid. That was pretty great. I
also loved, back in that arc, the vote whether or

00:18:14.823 --> 00:18:25.288
not to go down into that chasm, and winning the
vote, and Vex and Keyleth flipping us the birds

00:18:25.288 --> 00:18:31.323
and leaving anyway. I thought that was a great
moment. I get a lot of messages going like, "Oh!

00:18:31.323 --> 00:18:38.022
"Suck it! You totally ate it there! Why did you do
that?! You almost died! That was the wrong move!"

00:18:38.022 --> 00:18:47.671
That are some of my favorite moments on the show.
Otherwise, it'd just be an on-rails shooter in an

00:18:47.671 --> 00:18:54.742
arcade. I love when things go wrong. I think,
really, my favorite moments are when the shit hits

00:18:54.742 --> 00:19:05.431
the fan and we have to figure it out. Yep. All
right. I hope that was okay. I probably won't do

00:19:05.431 --> 00:19:11.790
this too much because I'm busy, but I'll do it
once in a while. So I hope that was fun. Thanks

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:23.313
for coming, guys. Have a good weekend, and I will
see you all next week. All right. Signing off. If

00:19:23.313 --> 00:19:26.742
I can figure out how to sign off. How do you turn
it off? Do I just force quit?
