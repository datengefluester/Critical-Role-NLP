NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.154
[faint music]

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:21.710
MATT: Let's see. This is not-- Hello everyone! I
don't know if it went onto Twitter or not, and I'm

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:28.176
glad you guys could join. I got a haircut, as I'm
sure some of you see. It was absolutely necessary

00:00:28.176 --> 00:00:34.302
because it got way too long out of laziness and
I'd like to cut it more often than I had, and it'd

00:00:34.302 --> 00:00:40.711
become just a mane of ridiculousness. At least
here it'll have a chance to grow. It's not that

00:00:40.711 --> 00:00:43.722
far from the length I had when the show first
started, so it's not completely out of the blue, I

00:00:43.722 --> 00:00:48.529
don't think. I'm also a pacer as I talk, so I
apologize if you keep seeing the background shift.

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:56.358
Sorry about that. Marisha and Marisha's dad are
here as well, and we've all been doing work around

00:00:56.358 --> 00:01:05.551
the place as we go. I'll show you a little bit,
now. Been getting some work done over here. Say

00:01:05.551 --> 00:01:06.187
hi, Marisha!

00:01:06.187 --> 00:01:08.438
MARISHA: Hi guys! Did you show them our new
floors?

00:01:08.438 --> 00:01:10.525
MATT: No, I haven't shown them. Right now

00:01:10.525 --> 00:01:18.212
we got new tile floors in here. Much better than
the crappy grandma floors we had before. Say hi to

00:01:18.212 --> 00:01:19.274
Mark, Marisha's dad.

00:01:19.274 --> 00:01:20.515
MARK: Hello.

00:01:20.515 --> 00:01:29.866
MATT: There
you go. I thought you guys could chill for a

00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:34.383
little bit here today, during International
Tabletop Day. Me and Liam will be up at the studio

00:01:34.723 --> 00:01:40.131
in a few hours, at 9:30 Pacific to play a game
called Everyone is John. For those of you who

00:01:40.131 --> 00:01:43.427
aren't familiar with it, it's very strange and
fun, and I've never played it before, so I'm

00:01:43.427 --> 00:01:50.031
excited. But yeah! This is primarily a bunch of
Critmas that was left over: some packages that

00:01:53.355 --> 00:01:58.712
either didn't make it in time, got caught in the
mail, or whatever case it may be. We have a bunch

00:01:58.712 --> 00:02:07.711
more letters and things here we're going to open
and say thank yous. We don't have the full cast

00:02:07.711 --> 00:02:11.451
here. We'll be opening them for them and then
making little piles for what goes to who so we can

00:02:11.451 --> 00:02:17.662
deliver them to them next time we see them,
hopefully this Thursday. Possibly more minis? I

00:02:17.662 --> 00:02:24.412
don't know. I'm waiting on Marisha to get out of the
bathroom here so we can actually begin. In the

00:02:24.412 --> 00:02:29.789
meantime, you guys feel like you want to throw any
questions here until we're ready, I'm happy to do

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:35.662
a little Q&A. I don't know if they're any more
minis; we'll find out. I'm never against that

00:02:36.422 --> 00:02:44.760
idea. Yes, haircut. I know it's crazy, right? What
the heck, it's all gone? Only the chunks of it.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:55.712
Cool thing is it glows-- grows back. It glows
back. That'd be a little weird. People are

00:02:55.712 --> 00:02:59.631
freaking out about the hair, this is kind of
funny.

00:02:59.631 --> 00:03:02.284
MARISHA: I accidentally took a shower on

00:03:02.284 --> 00:03:03.327
when I [inaudible].

00:03:03.327 --> 00:03:06.794
MATT: Are you serious?
Marisha accidentally turned the shower on herself.

00:03:07.175 --> 00:03:11.543
MARISHA: I'm a little wet. I hate it
when that happens. Hi guys, did you show them your

00:03:11.543 --> 00:03:12.367
mini organization?

00:03:12.367 --> 00:03:15.350
MATT: No, I showed them a
little bit last time. I can show them, it's grown

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:16.187
a little bit.

00:03:16.187 --> 00:03:19.206
MARISHA: It's getting updated,
slowly but surely. We have so little time.

00:03:19.397 --> 00:03:26.147
MATT: For those who are asking what's a good place to
get minis, aside from your local comic shops and

00:03:26.147 --> 00:03:31.114
game stores, which have the packages. If you're
looking for specific ones you can go to

00:03:31.114 --> 00:03:39.427
miniaturemarket.com, Troll and Toad, eBay actually
has a good mini selection. Or you can order the

00:03:39.427 --> 00:03:49.144
unopened boxes from Amazon as well if they're in
stock. Hero Forge is new material, which is a much

00:03:49.457 --> 00:03:57.393
higher quality material, which is great. Any tips
you have to get your wife into D&D? Show her some

00:03:57.393 --> 00:04:01.915
Acquisitions Inc. or Critical Role or something
and see if it's something she'd be into. If she

00:04:01.915 --> 00:04:09.249
likes narrative, if she likes storytelling, or if
she likes being random with her friends and having

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:14.591
silly times in a fantasy world, then hopefully
that'll be just a little push to get on there.

00:04:14.591 --> 00:04:22.180
Tips on painting minis? There's plenty of great
YouTube channels that do step-by-step tutorials on

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.869
miniature painting that I highly recommend. I
don't know any off the top of my head, but you can

00:04:25.869 --> 00:04:31.555
search "painting war miniatures" or "fantasy
miniatures." There's a lot of great tutorials, but

00:04:31.555 --> 00:04:38.306
as an overview, you want to make sure you do a
dark coat first. If you want more muddled colors

00:04:38.306 --> 00:04:43.923
do a dark primer, or lighter primer if you want
brighter colors to come out in the final model.

00:04:43.923 --> 00:04:50.763
Then you just paint the model, all the colors you
want in different places. Then you do a wash,

00:04:50.763 --> 00:04:56.695
which is like an ink wash pass on the model, and
what it does is it seeps into the nooks and

00:04:56.695 --> 00:05:02.575
crannies and giving the appearance of shadow and
shading. Then you do dry-brushing. You take a

00:05:02.575 --> 00:05:10.039
stiff brush, usually small, and dip lighter colors
than what the base coats were; fairly brighter but

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:16.842
the same tone. Then you brush it on a paper towel
or a small towel on the side until most of the

00:05:16.842 --> 00:05:24.008
paint is off the brush, just a little bit. Then
you dust the highest ridges of the darker color in

00:05:24.008 --> 00:05:32.156
places where it is, and it gives the appearance of
shine and light sourcing, which is kind of fun. If

00:05:32.156 --> 00:05:36.677
you go on YouTube, there's a lot of really great
in-depth tutorials you can find there. "Any

00:05:36.677 --> 00:05:41.277
"possibility of attending a Scottish con?" You got
to get a Scottish con to invite us! I would love

00:05:41.277 --> 00:05:45.974
that. Scotland I've never been to. It's where my
family's background is, and I would absolutely

00:05:45.974 --> 00:05:51.367
adore the chance to go to Scotland, so hopefully.
If you know any cons nearby, tell them to invite

00:05:51.367 --> 00:05:58.860
us. That'd be great. Anyway, here's the mini
cabinet. It is growing larger and larger and

00:05:59.132 --> 00:06:12.255
organization is progressing, piece by piece. Then
of course we have Thordak over there. I have a

00:06:12.255 --> 00:06:18.405
problem. I have a serious problem. What are my
thoughts on monks? Monks are awesome. Monks are

00:06:18.405 --> 00:06:22.694
amazing. They're a great class that I think is
underused, and I think a lot of people have a hard

00:06:22.694 --> 00:06:26.642
time finding a way to fit it into a fantasy
setting, but I don't think it's hard at all,

00:06:26.642 --> 00:06:30.691
especially if you watch Conan. You find that kind
of -- and consider back in those time periods,

00:06:30.691 --> 00:06:36.865
there was that transition between the East and the
West, Europe, Silk Road to China and that whole

00:06:36.865 --> 00:06:40.704
circumstance. There's a lot of cultural influences
you can pull from that transition and that time

00:06:40.704 --> 00:06:45.231
period that can be a fun stylistic way to
incorporate your monk into a campaign. Or just

00:06:45.231 --> 00:06:52.098
consider the different deities and different gods
of the pantheon prefer the idea of martial control

00:06:52.098 --> 00:06:59.127
and training as a means of purifying one's spirit
and soul and so that makes a cool drive for a

00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:03.982
character. Monks are just great in combat. They're
fun. You can do a lot of unique and interesting

00:07:03.982 --> 00:07:11.260
maneuvers and flavor them well. If you love any
Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan films, it's great. Let's

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:17.721
see. Will I be playing the Overwatch beta? I hope
so. I'll be playing the crap out of Overwatch when

00:07:17.721 --> 00:07:23.531
it comes in. I've just finally started Dark Souls
III last night. Haven't had time until then, and

00:07:23.531 --> 00:07:27.921
even then, it was midnight to 2:00 AM. I was like,
"Okay, I'll make a character," and I spent a while

00:07:27.921 --> 00:07:33.796
trying to decide what to do. I made two: I made
Lady Kima and Grog Strongjaw. I'm actually tearing

00:07:33.796 --> 00:07:40.934
through the game as Grog right now, which is kind
of funny. I figure it's a good way. Positive

00:07:40.934 --> 00:07:46.291
thoughts to your wife's surgery. All the positive
thoughts, crossed hearts, thumbs up, crossed

00:07:46.291 --> 00:07:54.519
fingers, all the good stuff. If wanted to play a
dwarf bard, what college would I be in? Oh, man. I

00:07:54.776 --> 00:07:59.563
lend myself to the Lore college, because I like
the expansion of spell use, but for the dwarf

00:07:59.563 --> 00:08:03.923
bard, I'd probably end up going Valor, because I
like the idea of him being more aggressive and

00:08:03.923 --> 00:08:14.464
battle-oriented. But that's just me. Dwarf versus
elf? I'm probably going to go dwarf. Elves get a

00:08:14.464 --> 00:08:18.498
lot of love in most media. I think dwarves are
underappreciated a lot of times, and they're one

00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:26.908
of my favorite races, so dwarf, definitely. How
many times has Grog died so far in Dark Souls?

00:08:26.908 --> 00:08:32.402
Three, which is not bad, considering. I've played
a lot of Souls games, so I know most of the

00:08:32.402 --> 00:08:41.717
tricks. Your bard is multiclassing into blood
hunter? That's amazing! (laughs) Oh, thank you,

00:08:41.717 --> 00:08:48.125
Meghan, it's coming along. The house is coming
along, bit by bit. Do I happen to do any DM tip

00:08:48.125 --> 00:08:52.543
videos? I did eight of them in the first run;
we're hoping to go back and do more soon.

00:08:52.543 --> 00:08:58.589
Scheduling has been a nightmare lately. I have
already ideas and outlines for future episodes,

00:08:58.589 --> 00:09:05.474
but if you are chafing at the bit, Matt Colville
actually does an amazing series, far more in-depth

00:09:05.474 --> 00:09:09.992
than anything I've done, on tips and tricks of
dungeon master-ing and building your own world. I

00:09:09.992 --> 00:09:14.453
highly recommend you look him up on YouTube. Look
up "Matt Colville DM Tips," and his videos are

00:09:14.453 --> 00:09:19.260
fantastic, so highly recommend those. Ah, Marisha,
are you ready?

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.393
MARISHA: I am so ready.

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:29.360
MATT: All right, so we shall begin the opening. I
went great axe man for Grog, couldn't help it. All

00:09:29.584 --> 00:09:34.426
right, we're turning this around on Marisha now.
Hi, Marisha.

00:09:34.426 --> 00:09:39.993
MARISHA: Hi, how are you guys? (kisses) How's
everyone doing?

00:09:39.993 --> 00:09:42.582
MATT: Everyone seems to be doing good and says
hello.

00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:50.265
MARISHA: So yeah, Matt's freshly showered and
blew-dried his hair. I've been doing construction

00:09:50.265 --> 00:09:52.046
work on the house all day.

00:09:52.046 --> 00:09:54.581
MATT: It's okay, I looked like a hobo about an
hour ago.

00:09:54.581 --> 00:09:58.833
MARISHA: I had sawdust in my hair. I've been
cutting down dead trees and pressure-washing the

00:09:58.833 --> 00:10:09.541
house and doing manual labor because he hates
doing manual labor. Okay, so am I just picking a

00:10:09.541 --> 00:10:11.946
box and opening one, just like Christmas?

00:10:11.946 --> 00:10:14.090
MATT: Yeah, boxes, letters, whichever one you want
to do.

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:15.686
MARISHA: Oh my goodness gracious.

00:10:15.686 --> 00:10:20.973
MATT: Scissors are there. You've got your cider.
You've got your chai. By the way, check out this

00:10:20.973 --> 00:10:22.447
awesome mug.

00:10:22.447 --> 00:10:24.913
MARISHA: Hey, got it from Wizards of the Coast.

00:10:24.913 --> 00:10:27.061
MATT: One of the gifts they gave me when I was up
there this past week.

00:10:27.061 --> 00:10:30.937
MARISHA: I think it's my dad's new favorite mug.
He's been using it for coffee since he's been

00:10:30.937 --> 00:10:37.395
here. My dad really likes it. All right, I'm
digging, because I see--

00:10:37.395 --> 00:10:39.114
MATT: They're asking where you got your leggings.

00:10:39.114 --> 00:10:50.730
MARISHA: I got these in one of those hundreds of
different leggings stores where all leggings, ten

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:52.732
dollars stores.

00:10:52.732 --> 00:10:54.012
MATT: It's off Melrose, isn't it?

00:10:54.012 --> 00:10:57.977
MARISHA: Off Melrose, yeah. So it's not like a
brand.

00:11:01.147 --> 00:11:03.291
MATT: Who is this for and from?

00:11:03.291 --> 00:11:12.381
MARISHA: We'll find out, but it's another
Adopt-a-Species.

00:11:12.841 --> 00:11:13.718
MATT: Awesome.

00:11:13.718 --> 00:11:23.710
MARISHA: I like those. It says Travis Willingham
on it, but that could just be because they wanted

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:24.671
to put a name.

00:11:24.671 --> 00:11:26.195
MATT: Someone said, "Air holes, uh-oh."

00:11:26.195 --> 00:11:28.611
(laughter)

00:11:28.611 --> 00:11:41.211
MARISHA: This is neat. From the World Wildlife
Federation. Ooh, what's it say? Oh, this is a gorilla.

00:11:41.818 --> 00:11:43.083
MATT: Oh, nice!

00:11:48.873 --> 00:11:59.308
MARISHA: Aww, no, it is for Grog. Said "Dear Grog,
This is a certificate of acknowledgement for Grog

00:11:59.687 --> 00:12:07.168
"Strongjaw." Someone adopted a gorilla. The problem
with these is they don't often tell you--

00:12:07.168 --> 00:12:08.967
MATT: Who sent it?

00:12:08.967 --> 00:12:16.315
MARISHA: Who sent it, and it's very frustrating. I
don't know how to fix that problem.

00:12:16.315 --> 00:12:19.732
MATT: Well, whoever sent the gorilla, you're
amazing.

00:12:19.732 --> 00:12:22.036
MARISHA: And there it is!

00:12:22.036 --> 00:12:23.676
MATT: Aww, look at the gorilla!

00:12:23.676 --> 00:12:31.626
MARISHA: (growls) I love the Adopt-a-Species
through the National Zoo. It's such a fantastic

00:12:31.626 --> 00:12:45.721
organization. Thank you guys so much! Yeah, let us
know, whoever adopted the gorilla for Grog, and we

00:12:45.721 --> 00:12:47.047
will deliver it for him.

00:12:47.047 --> 00:12:48.478
MATT: Do you want to go ahead and put that in the
Grog pile?

00:12:48.478 --> 00:12:53.150
MARISHA: Put that in the Grog pile, okay. Here's
another one for Travis.

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:57.147
MATT: The Grog pile is there. That's the Grog
pile. Another Travis gift?

00:12:57.147 --> 00:12:59.555
MARISHA: Wait, let me do this one, though. It's
heavy.

00:12:59.555 --> 00:13:03.477
MATT: I like how I brought scissors, but Marisha
decided to bring her knife out. That's why I love her.

00:13:03.483 --> 00:13:12.712
MARISHA: Knives are more efficient. That sounded
really sadistic, but that's not what I was going for.

00:13:13.113 --> 00:13:14.750
MATT: That's quite all right.

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:23.053
MARISHA: Ooh. Oh my goodness gracious. To
overlords. Oh, to Overlords. It's a letter for

00:13:23.053 --> 00:13:27.002
Overlords, I don't want to read it, just in case
he's-- To Critical Role cast. Two extra packs.

00:13:27.002 --> 00:13:34.098
What's going on? "Dear Critical Role, Thank you so
much for all the enjoyment you've brought me and

00:13:34.098 --> 00:13:37.536
"all the other Critters. I'll keep it short by
simply saying thank you for letting us into your

00:13:37.536 --> 00:13:42.647
"world. I laugh with you, cheer with you, cry with
you. Amazing ride so far. May it continue for much

00:13:42.647 --> 00:13:48.929
"longer. Since you bring me so much joy I figured a
gift that would bring you and your close ones joy

00:13:48.929 --> 00:13:53.347
"would be fitting, so I hope you'll enjoy these
custom playing cards."

00:13:53.347 --> 00:13:54.257
MATT: What?

00:13:54.257 --> 00:13:58.842
MARISHA: "Love, Emily @emilyfantasies." Oh my
god.

00:13:58.842 --> 00:14:01.542
MATT: (laughs) That's awesome!

00:14:01.888 --> 00:14:05.813
MARISHA: Holy crap. And she sent--

00:14:05.813 --> 00:14:08.614
MATT: That's so cool!

00:14:08.614 --> 00:14:14.657
MARISHA: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten. So it says, "The two extra

00:14:14.657 --> 00:14:19.093
"packs--" Which, I mean, to be fair, me and you can
share a pack, and I'm sure Laura and Travis can

00:14:19.093 --> 00:14:21.445
share a pack, and we'd have a few extra ones.

00:14:21.445 --> 00:14:23.393
MATT: Yeah, we can put a few extras as giveaways
to Critters.

00:14:23.393 --> 00:14:28.295
MARISHA: Yeah. "The two extra packs can be given
to whomever you wish, perhaps to some of the

00:14:28.295 --> 00:14:37.697
"people featured on the cards, like Kit, Wil, and
Mary or to lucky Critters in a giveaway or even to

00:14:37.697 --> 00:14:41.550
"the kids at 826, who I'm sure would love to play
card games too. I'll let you decide."

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:43.139
MATT: Oh, snap.

00:14:43.139 --> 00:15:15.429
MARISHA: Wait a second. Look at these really nice
art boxes too. Don't ruin the cards. Sorry, this

00:15:15.429 --> 00:15:31.496
is boring. Look at that. These are great,
actually. (laughs)

00:15:31.496 --> 00:15:33.738
MATT: What? Show us.

00:15:33.738 --> 00:15:36.850
MARISHA: The Jack.

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:42.464
MATT: Oh, check it out! It's Lillith as the Jack!
That's so cool!

00:15:42.464 --> 00:15:46.286
MARISHA: Queen is Cassandra.

00:15:46.286 --> 00:15:49.003
MATT: Cassandra is the Queen.

00:15:49.003 --> 00:15:50.845
MARISHA: Percy is the King.

00:15:50.845 --> 00:15:52.648
MATT: Percy. He's the King.

00:15:52.648 --> 00:15:54.552
MARISHA: Guess who's the Joker?

00:15:54.552 --> 00:15:57.140
MATT: Briarwoods?

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:58.273
MARISHA: No.

00:15:58.273 --> 00:16:04.067
MATT: Buzzsaw outside with the door open?

00:16:04.067 --> 00:16:04.752
MARISHA: No.

00:16:04.752 --> 00:16:06.086
MATT: Scanlan.

00:16:06.086 --> 00:16:07.318
MARISHA: No.

00:16:07.318 --> 00:16:18.334
MATT: (laughs) I'm the Joker, that's rad. My
pupils are dice, that's got to be painful.

00:16:18.334 --> 00:16:21.222
MARISHA: (laughs) That's great.

00:16:21.222 --> 00:16:23.408
MATT: Yeah, that's a trip to the emergency room.

00:16:23.408 --> 00:16:26.684
MARISHA: Those are really nice cards. That's
fantastic.

00:16:26.684 --> 00:16:28.502
MATT: And so cute! Aww.

00:16:28.502 --> 00:16:29.564
MARISHA: You guys.

00:16:29.564 --> 00:16:31.065
MATT: Thank you, guys.

00:16:31.065 --> 00:16:37.939
MARISHA: Thank you. This was @emilyfantasies.
Thank you, Emily.

00:16:37.939 --> 00:16:38.960
MATT: Thank you, Emily.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:45.959
MARISHA: Thank you, Emily. These are so great.
They better freak out about these.

00:16:45.959 --> 00:16:49.142
MATT: Should I go close the glass door? Hold this
for a second.

00:16:49.142 --> 00:17:02.483
MARISHA: I'm going to put these back, then I'll
have a free hand. Okay. Two extra packs, what to

00:17:02.483 --> 00:17:10.786
do with two extra packs. Oh my goodness gracious.
You guys, you outdo yourselves every time.

00:17:10.786 --> 00:17:18.475
MATT: All righty. Next up. These cards are for
everybody. Put this in the everybody pile.

00:17:18.822 --> 00:17:22.877
MARISHA: Let's see what this is. That goes to the
Overlords.

00:17:22.877 --> 00:17:33.788
MATT: All righty. That's Ryan and Cookie. The
gentle sounds of buzzsawing in the background.

00:17:33.788 --> 00:17:35.143
It's a relaxing day for me.

00:17:35.143 --> 00:17:41.165
MARISHA: We could turn the music up a little bit,
if you want. Help drown it out, blend with it.

00:17:41.165 --> 00:17:42.948
MATT: No, I kind of like it.

00:17:42.948 --> 00:17:44.169
MARISHA: You kind of like it?

00:17:44.169 --> 00:17:45.337
MATT: It adds texture to the atmosphere.

00:17:45.337 --> 00:17:47.930
MARISHA: (gasps) Oh!

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:48.671
MATT: What?

00:17:48.671 --> 00:17:54.526
MARISHA: Someone just sent us the best VO care
package.

00:17:54.526 --> 00:17:55.489
MATT: What is it?

00:17:55.489 --> 00:17:57.918
MARISHA: Someone's been paying attention.

00:17:57.918 --> 00:18:03.266
MATT: The buzzsaw is Marisha's dad cutting a bunch
of scrap wood in the backyard to get rid of it.

00:18:03.266 --> 00:18:08.267
MARISHA: No, he's making a frame for the door to
the water heater.

00:18:08.267 --> 00:18:10.143
MATT: I now know what he's doing.

00:18:10.143 --> 00:18:18.215
MARISHA: (laughs) (singing) Who sent this? I'm
trying to figure this out.

00:18:18.215 --> 00:18:19.665
MATT: (singing) Is it on the front?

00:18:19.665 --> 00:18:21.656
MARISHA: (singing) Give me a second.

00:18:21.656 --> 00:18:24.737
MATT: (singing) Who's the mysterious benefactor?

00:18:24.737 --> 00:18:32.120
MARISHA: A gift for you. "If I didn't hear it from
them, then it must have been a Rob Paulsen

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:38.196
"podcast. At least I think this is what they were
talking about. I used to use these a lot. Thank

00:18:38.196 --> 00:18:52.988
"you for how you inspire us. Your fan,
@gnacinojay." G-N-A-C-

00:18:52.988 --> 00:18:54.023
MATT: Let me see it.

00:18:54.023 --> 00:19:01.928
MARISHA: But, these are fantastic. Taliesin swears
by these. They are the honey loquat candy, the

00:19:01.928 --> 00:19:04.067
honey loquat cough drops.

00:19:04.067 --> 00:19:06.216
MATT: Oh, snap. The same people who make the Nin
Jiom Pei Pa Koa.

00:19:06.216 --> 00:19:12.216
MARISHA: It's the Nin Jiom Pei Pa Koa, but in
cough drop form, which is fantastic.

00:19:12.216 --> 00:19:17.126
MATT: Oh, this is glorious. That is the "Fred
juice" in candy form.

00:19:17.126 --> 00:19:18.663
MARISHA: Oh my god.

00:19:18.663 --> 00:19:20.015
MATT: "Fred juice," I should explain.

00:19:20.015 --> 00:19:23.010
MARISHA: That's amazing. "Fred juice," yeah.

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:28.896
MATT: There's this Chinese cough syrup stuff that
this is actually the candy form of that Fred

00:19:28.896 --> 00:19:32.040
Tatasciore, who's an incredibly talented voice
actor who's the voice of the Hulk in pretty much

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:35.459
all of Marvel's stuff discovered as a way of
coating your throat and protecting it during

00:19:35.459 --> 00:19:39.739
really rough voice-over sessions. Because he
discovered it, it's called "Hulk juice," "Fred

00:19:39.739 --> 00:19:44.540
juice." It's weird no matter how you say it, but
someone was paying attention and got us some candy.

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:46.215
MARISHA: We call it "boom-boom juice."

00:19:46.215 --> 00:19:47.812
MATT: "Boom-boom juice?"

00:19:47.812 --> 00:19:49.234
MARISHA: I don't know.

00:19:49.234 --> 00:19:50.371
MATT: That's pretty fun.

00:19:50.371 --> 00:19:52.804
MARISHA: I've heard it been called a lot of
things.

00:19:52.804 --> 00:20:00.558
MATT: You made an amazing thing! You're just being
silly, Meghan. We appreciated them all, thank you--

00:20:00.558 --> 00:20:03.729
MARISHA: This already looks (gasps) incredible.

00:20:03.729 --> 00:20:06.716
MATT: What is that? Is it all books from people?

00:20:07.094 --> 00:20:07.945
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:20:07.945 --> 00:20:09.225
MATT: What the heck?

00:20:09.225 --> 00:20:14.988
MARISHA: These popped open, so I'm trying to get
them back into a more presentary form before I

00:20:14.988 --> 00:20:20.529
pull them out. These are crayons.

00:20:20.529 --> 00:20:22.278
MATT: Crayons?

00:20:22.278 --> 00:20:25.370
MARISHA: Gilmore's Glorious Color Sticks.

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:26.896
MATT: (laughs)

00:20:26.896 --> 00:20:29.494
MARISHA: They even say "Gilmore's" on the crayon.

00:20:29.494 --> 00:20:32.517
MATT: (as Gilmore) "Of course they do, they're
glorious."

00:20:32.517 --> 00:20:37.013
MARISHA: And we each have books--

00:20:37.013 --> 00:20:41.640
MATT: Oh, please tell me these are coloring books.
I'm going to freak out.

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:45.139
MARISHA: Oh?

00:20:45.139 --> 00:20:47.276
MATT: Was I right?

00:20:49.986 --> 00:21:03.918
MARISHA: You're going to-- Okay, hang on. Let me
see. I'm trying to figure it out. Look, normally

00:21:03.931 --> 00:21:10.471
we sort these things beforehand and get an idea
and I didn't. "To the cast of Critical Role: I

00:21:10.471 --> 00:21:18.893
"have to admit, I never considered writing a letter
to someone who has no idea who I am before, but

00:21:18.893 --> 00:21:23.554
"after seeing Critmas happen so many times and
seeing your honest delight in hearing from people

00:21:23.554 --> 00:21:27.212
"who love the show, it seemed like the most natural
thing in the world. I found books included in this

00:21:27.212 --> 00:21:32.224
"package are my way of saying thank you for sharing
your adventures with us--" Oh, "the books included

00:21:32.224 --> 00:21:37.215
"in this package." Sorry, it's been a long day. "I
found the show at a time when I really needed it.

00:21:37.215 --> 00:21:41.674
"Laughing out loud was something I hadn't been
doing much of late. Life is pretty good, but

00:21:41.674 --> 00:21:52.201
"depression lies, and had been quite convincing for
a while." It goes on: "I've enjoyed every moment

00:21:52.201 --> 00:21:58.924
"of learning how to bind books." Okay, wait. "I
love to see all the wonderful things you create--"

00:21:58.924 --> 00:22:06.260
(reading quickly, mumbling) "I can't draw,
although I'm learning, or paint, but I recently

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:12.479
"stumbled--" Okay. "But I can use InDesign. I
recently create and modify forms for a living, and

00:22:12.479 --> 00:22:16.507
"I have recently stumbled across a tutorial for
book-binding. I've enjoyed every moment of

00:22:16.507 --> 00:22:23.518
"learning how to bind books; creative and exacting
at the same time. It's certainly experimental, as

00:22:23.518 --> 00:22:31.570
"the first few tries were unsurprisingly failures--
but the good kind, where you learn. A book with a

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:39.298
"wrapped book-board cover looks weird, let me tell
you. The books I've sent are far from perfect. I

00:22:39.298 --> 00:22:43.325
"shake my first and eat the pages, but I'm proud of
them. In a bit more than a month, I've learned to

00:22:43.325 --> 00:22:48.761
"create hardcover books and they're functional,
individual, and fun to create."

00:22:48.761 --> 00:22:49.654
MATT: That's so cool!

00:22:49.654 --> 00:22:55.608
MARISHA: That's amazing. "Thank you for sharing
your adventures and infectious joy in the game and

00:22:55.891 --> 00:23:00.406
"each other and your honest pleasures and
interacting with people who wish we could be

00:23:00.406 --> 00:23:02.508
"adventuring with you." Aw.

00:23:02.508 --> 00:23:04.087
MATT: Aw, you are adventuring with us.

00:23:04.087 --> 00:23:09.843
MARISHA: You absolutely are. From Lori Otis, which
is @otis_lori on Twitter, which I know I've seen

00:23:09.843 --> 00:23:11.124
tweets from her before.

00:23:11.124 --> 00:23:12.910
MATT: Thank you, Lori! That's so cool!

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:22.614
MARISHA: Thank you so much, Lori. Look, Vex and
the twins. Oh my god! It's a ledger book.

00:23:22.614 --> 00:23:25.276
MATT: That's cool!

00:23:25.276 --> 00:23:37.966
MARISHA: Oh, this is for Vex and Trinket, I'm
sorry. Look at this, it's got date, items, balance

00:23:37.966 --> 00:23:39.661
carried forward, debit, and credit. It's an
accounting book. Look how gorgeous that is.

00:23:39.661 --> 00:23:41.846
MATT: That's so cute.

00:23:41.846 --> 00:23:43.327
MARISHA: Oh, this one's mine.

00:23:43.327 --> 00:23:45.056
MATT: What's in your book?

00:23:45.056 --> 00:23:46.834
MARISHA: Oh my god!

00:23:46.834 --> 00:23:52.064
MATT: Of course Vex would have the ledger, because
she's the money-taker.

00:23:52.064 --> 00:23:56.691
MARISHA: Well, I'm the note-taker, so mine's a
notebook, but look at these note pages with the

00:23:56.691 --> 00:24:03.534
trees-- and the eagle! It's got an eagle in it.

00:24:03.534 --> 00:24:05.090
MATT: That's so cool!

00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:14.074
MARISHA: That's fantastic. These are handmade
hardcover books that someone made custom for each

00:24:14.074 --> 00:24:14.546
of us.

00:24:14.546 --> 00:24:15.562
MATT: Hi, Mark.

00:24:15.562 --> 00:24:17.044
MARK: Hey, how are you guys?

00:24:17.044 --> 00:24:18.407
MARISHA: Meet my dad.

00:24:18.407 --> 00:24:19.103
MARK: That's nice.

00:24:19.103 --> 00:24:21.105
MARISHA: This is the book that they made for me.

00:24:21.105 --> 00:24:22.057
MARK: Custom made?

00:24:22.057 --> 00:24:29.894
MARISHA: Yeah. I already read it, but she said she
spent a month learning how to bind books. So

00:24:29.894 --> 00:24:30.766
here's Matt's.

00:24:30.766 --> 00:24:32.353
MARK: She did a good job.

00:24:32.353 --> 00:24:35.922
MARISHA: Oh my god, look. Yours has dragons in it,
babe!

00:24:35.922 --> 00:24:37.352
MATT: Damn right, it does! (laughs)

00:24:37.352 --> 00:24:40.292
MARISHA: That's so cool.

00:24:40.292 --> 00:24:42.440
MATT: That's so cool, thank you so much, Lori!

00:24:42.814 --> 00:24:43.510
MARISHA: Yours is awesome.

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:45.753
MATT: All right, we're going to have to give these
to the rest of the crew too.

00:24:45.753 --> 00:24:47.794
MARISHA: Scanlan-- (squeaks)

00:24:47.794 --> 00:24:48.766
MATT: What?

00:24:48.766 --> 00:24:56.022
MARISHA: It's notes on one side and sheet music on
the other.

00:24:56.022 --> 00:24:57.270
MATT: Oh snap.

00:24:57.270 --> 00:25:06.226
MARISHA: It's a bard book-- and look, it's got a
lute on the side. Holy shit, you guys-- and yes,

00:25:06.226 --> 00:25:17.282
Grog's, it says in here, "Travis, since Grog can't
read or write, I had a challenge on my hands. I

00:25:17.282 --> 00:25:21.336
"had originally wanted to make Grog a coloring book
full of pictures of some kind, but I didn't want

00:25:21.336 --> 00:25:26.191
"to use others' art without permission, so I put
some pictures of some of Grog's favorite kind of

00:25:26.191 --> 00:25:31.359
"things-- couldn't find good line art of a
barmaid-- and left some room for him to be

00:25:31.359 --> 00:25:36.595
"creative inside the box from Gilmore's. He can
take advantage of his vast knowledge of colors."

00:25:36.595 --> 00:25:37.407
MATT: That's so good!

00:25:37.407 --> 00:25:40.910
MARISHA: "Grog's character moments are some of my
favorites, and Grog and Craven Edge are some of my

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:48.362
"favorite comedy duo. Happy giving." She made him a
soft-bound coloring book.

00:25:48.362 --> 00:25:51.455
MATT: (laughs) A cask of beer and an axe.

00:25:51.455 --> 00:25:53.497
MARISHA: And an axe, and case.

00:25:53.497 --> 00:25:55.583
MATT: (laughing) That's so cute!

00:25:55.583 --> 00:26:00.145
MARISHA: And a Trinket bear, and a Craven Edge
sword.

00:26:00.145 --> 00:26:03.363
MATT and MARISHA: That's adorable.

00:26:03.363 --> 00:26:11.560
MARISHA: I'm selfish, I want to look and see what
all-- oh my god. Percy has graph paper on one side.

00:26:11.973 --> 00:26:13.607
MATT: That's really cool.

00:26:13.607 --> 00:26:21.527
MARISHA: And notes on the other. These are
fantastic. These are fantastic, Lori! Vax. What's

00:26:21.527 --> 00:26:32.084
yours, Vax? Oh, of course, snakes and daggers.
That's great with the green. And Pike, oh, it's

00:26:32.084 --> 00:26:43.353
Sarenrae's symbols! That's fantastic. Thank you so
much, Lori, these are gorgeous. I'm in love. Do

00:26:43.353 --> 00:26:44.788
you want to trade off?

00:26:44.788 --> 00:26:48.546
MATT: Sure, we can do that. Put this over in the
group pile. Ba da dow!

00:26:48.546 --> 00:26:54.720
MARISHA: Want to take the hot seat? Here, you stay
there, I'll move over.

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:58.407
MATT: You're going to take from this side? All
right. Change in the guard!

00:26:58.407 --> 00:27:00.144
MARISHA: Oh, do you want me to just flip?

00:27:00.144 --> 00:27:01.378
MATT: Doesn't matter to me.

00:27:01.378 --> 00:27:05.490
MARISHA: Yeah, that's fine. I want to stay on this
comfy new ottoman that I just bought.

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:13.874
MATT: This cardboard had already been opened, this
one as well. I'm trying to keep the boxes

00:27:13.874 --> 00:27:30.397
organized so we don't trash up the place too bad.
Pull some of these over here. Now, this is to Travis.

00:27:30.795 --> 00:27:33.222
MARISHA: What did Travis get?

00:27:33.222 --> 00:27:37.965
MATT: Wonder if they had-- I don't see a name on
here, but it's sent from Half Price Books.

00:27:37.965 --> 00:27:45.587
MARISHA: Ooh, I love the Half Price Books store!
Wait, is that Half Price Books from Kentucky? From Louisville?

00:27:45.587 --> 00:27:46.673
MATT: Mesquite, Texas.

00:27:46.673 --> 00:27:50.088
MARISHA: Oh, Texas. What were the ones from
Kentucky?

00:27:50.088 --> 00:27:54.098
MATT: A letter. "Hey Grog, being a Cowboys fan, I
"thought you might like these for your collection.

00:27:54.098 --> 00:27:58.733
"Check the front of each book." From Dim Dimmley.
To Grog.

00:27:58.733 --> 00:28:00.069
MARISHA: Dim Dimmley.

00:28:00.069 --> 00:28:01.945
MATT: Wright Up Front!

00:28:01.945 --> 00:28:05.245
MARISHA: And Game On. Oh my god.

00:28:05.245 --> 00:28:07.220
MATT: Oh, he's going to love those.

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:07.753
MARISHA: Insane.

00:28:07.753 --> 00:28:13.337
MATT: Thank you, from Travis, to you Dim Dimmley.
We're going to pass those on to him. That also

00:28:13.337 --> 00:28:30.052
goes in the Travis pile. Perfect, all right. Next
one. There's tape on this one. Probably-- Ha ha!

00:28:30.052 --> 00:28:35.561
MARISHA: Scissors! Simple solutions for complex
problems.

00:28:35.926 --> 00:28:42.384
MATT: Indeed. This one is-- I don't see a name on
it.

00:28:42.384 --> 00:28:46.259
MARISHA: What's it say on the return address? Up
front.

00:28:46.259 --> 00:28:48.021
MATT: That's what I'm looking.

00:28:48.021 --> 00:28:50.006
MARISHA: Right there, on the label, isn't it?

00:28:50.006 --> 00:28:53.745
MATT: I'm looking. Looks like the name is K1R757.

00:28:53.745 --> 00:28:56.666
MARISHA: Dagon's totally taking a bath behind
you.

00:28:56.666 --> 00:29:09.790
MATT: Oh, Dagon. Here's a letter, thank you. Huh.
"Hello. A while ago, Zac said the reason you do a

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:13.315
"song and dance to pour your water is because you
didn't want to advertise that you were drinking,

00:29:13.315 --> 00:29:16.991
"so I made you some bags to put the bottles in."
(laughs)

00:29:16.991 --> 00:29:18.592
MARISHA: Oh, like hobo bags?

00:29:18.592 --> 00:29:21.403
MATT: They made alcohol bags.

00:29:21.403 --> 00:29:25.359
MARISHA: Alkie bags? Oh shit, yeah. With labels!

00:29:25.359 --> 00:29:28.026
MATT: With little plastic label things.

00:29:28.026 --> 00:29:30.437
MARISHA: Oh my god, that's so great.

00:29:30.437 --> 00:29:38.607
MATT: Oh, what? And a Minxie shirt. It's tied on
the sides, the way you like it.

00:29:38.607 --> 00:29:42.607
MARISHA: Oh my gosh, I don't have to alter it. "I
would like to go Minxie."

00:29:42.607 --> 00:29:44.287
MATT: Yeah.

00:29:44.287 --> 00:29:45.837
MARISHA: That's so cute!

00:29:45.837 --> 00:29:47.527
MATT: "To Marisha and Laura--"

00:29:47.527 --> 00:29:49.091
MARISHA: That's so cute.

00:29:49.512 --> 00:29:51.760
MATT: "The art on these shirts was done by an 11
year-old."

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:52.597
MARISHA: What.

00:29:52.597 --> 00:29:59.801
MATT and MARISHA: "Don't be sad bear, be happy
bear."

00:29:59.801 --> 00:30:09.880
MATT: That's adorable. "Done by an 11 year old.
She showed her teacher, who she said--" All right,

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:14.558
I need to read this for you guys. "The art on
these shirts was done by an 11 year old. She

00:30:14.558 --> 00:30:19.106
"showed her teacher, who said she had no talent and
should give up on drawing, you would never like

00:30:19.106 --> 00:30:24.572
"it. This 11 year old believed her teacher over me.
So I bought it from her and told her I would not

00:30:24.572 --> 00:30:30.701
"give you the sheets, but that I would put it on a
t-shirt. She didn't believe me, so she agreed. Mom

00:30:30.701 --> 00:30:35.747
"agreed too. It's a little smudged because my four
year old assisted me to put it on a t-shirt. I

00:30:35.747 --> 00:30:40.726
"used a tutorial for Marisha's shirt. Please help
prove this teacher wrong." Well, you've already

00:30:40.726 --> 00:30:46.676
proved this teacher wrong. These are awesome, and
I think everyone watching agrees. These are so cute!

00:30:46.686 --> 00:30:59.592
MARISHA: Look at that. Well, I always need new
t-shirts for the show. That is so cute. That's so

00:30:59.592 --> 00:31:03.351
adorable. "I would like to go Minxie."

00:31:03.351 --> 00:31:17.913
MATT: I'm trying to see who this is from. Suzanne
LeBlanc. Sue LeBlanc b-- I can't-- ah, it's so

00:31:18.165 --> 00:31:23.815
small! Your writing is really small, Suzanne, but
thank you so much! They're so cute.

00:31:23.815 --> 00:31:25.227
MARISHA: Suzanne...

00:31:25.227 --> 00:31:27.953
MATT: This is going to go in the Laura pile.

00:31:27.953 --> 00:31:30.084
MARISHA: That's amazing.

00:31:30.084 --> 00:31:35.524
MATT: Laura's pile's going right next to Travis's.
Just want to put them together so they get them both.

00:31:36.625 --> 00:31:41.517
MARISHA: That's so cute, too. And also better art
than I can do, once again, I just want to point

00:31:41.517 --> 00:31:42.235
that out.

00:31:42.235 --> 00:31:56.154
MATT: It's a good thing to point out. This is from
Jeff Grower of Fulton, New York. Come to my aid,

00:31:56.154 --> 00:31:59.331
fair blade. That rhymed.

00:31:59.331 --> 00:32:01.286
MARISHA: (giggles)

00:32:01.286 --> 00:32:07.143
MATT: It's the little things. It says Happy
Critmas on the box.

00:32:07.143 --> 00:32:17.050
MARISHA: Everyone's like, "What an asshole
teacher." Yeah. Word.

00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:23.008
MATT: Yeah. They're rare. There are a lot of
really good teachers out there. There are a few...

00:32:23.008 --> 00:32:27.953
it's the nature of humanity. "Happy Critmas! Just
wanted to let you all know that I love your show.

00:32:27.953 --> 00:32:32.743
"I started watching in December last year and have
gone back and watched every episode--" Nice. "You

00:32:32.743 --> 00:32:36.617
"have become the one show I can't wait to watch
each week. You are all awesome. Enclosed is

00:32:36.617 --> 00:32:41.197
"something that I hope brings you luck, in game and
out. These are real four-leaf clovers that I found

00:32:41.197 --> 00:32:50.664
"myself--" What? "--and laminated with the Critical
Role logo. They are credit card-sized for carrying

00:32:50.664 --> 00:32:51.853
"in a wallet."

00:32:51.853 --> 00:32:53.821
MARISHA: Oh, that's so sweet.

00:32:53.821 --> 00:32:58.510
MATT: "For a donation to charity, there is a
five-leaf clover. Whoever draws that, I'll make a

00:32:58.510 --> 00:33:04.375
"donation to that person's charity." I'm going to
hold onto these and when we see the group on

00:33:04.375 --> 00:33:08.268
Thursday, I'm going to have them pick, and whoever
draws it, Jeff's going to go ahead and make a

00:33:08.268 --> 00:33:11.302
donation to that charity. So Jeff, we're going to
hold on to that.

00:33:11.302 --> 00:33:13.284
MARISHA: That is a really good idea.

00:33:13.284 --> 00:33:18.453
MATT: This is so cool! They're all legit-- and
there's the five-leaf. Boom! All right, shuffling

00:33:18.453 --> 00:33:20.572
those up. We're going to bring those--

00:33:20.572 --> 00:33:22.436
MARISHA: You must be a lucky man.

00:33:22.436 --> 00:33:25.511
MATT: Apparently. I've never found one. I've
looked tremendously when I was a child.

00:33:25.511 --> 00:33:27.050
MARISHA: Oh, really? You've never found one?

00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:27.530
MATT: No!

00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:29.463
MARISHA: That's actually really sad. I'm sorry.

00:33:29.463 --> 00:33:37.898
MATT: It's okay. Things worked out all right. I
play D&D weekly on the internet. I'm very thankful

00:33:37.898 --> 00:33:44.876
for all I have. This is to-- oh, this is to
Marisha Ray, it looks like, so I'm going to have

00:33:44.876 --> 00:33:46.599
to turn this around on you, girl.

00:33:46.599 --> 00:33:47.620
MARISHA: Ooh, okay.

00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:55.368
MATT: Thank you, I don't feel too bad.

00:33:55.368 --> 00:33:59.295
MARISHA: Sounds of hammering. Cut along the line.

00:33:59.707 --> 00:34:04.218
MATT: (laughing) Bird overlord keeping them in
line. It's true. Dagon glares at us from above.

00:34:04.218 --> 00:34:06.189
MARISHA: She does. She knows who is what.

00:34:06.189 --> 00:34:09.446
MATT: Aw, hugs from Argentina! Hugs to you guys!

00:34:09.446 --> 00:34:20.786
MARISHA: Argentina! All right, let us see. Ooh,
it's already fancy, oh my goodness gracious. Who

00:34:20.786 --> 00:34:23.397
is this? What did you guys do?

00:34:26.637 --> 00:34:31.890
MATT: I am visiting the east coast at MomoCon,
actually, in Atlanta, at the end of May. At the

00:34:31.890 --> 00:34:34.376
end of next month, so if you're in the vicinity,
come say hello.

00:34:34.376 --> 00:34:40.371
MARISHA: "Keyleth Vinespeaker." My favorite
nickname, still to this day. Look at that awesome

00:34:40.615 --> 00:34:41.412
detail there.

00:34:41.412 --> 00:34:42.683
MATT: That's insane.

00:34:42.683 --> 00:34:55.572
MARISHA: Oh, The Madwife. This is from Madwife
Cinda, yet again. She says, "Marisha, The Madwife

00:34:55.572 --> 00:35:03.339
"strikes again! In honor of Keyleth, I have made a
small donation this month to the International

00:35:03.339 --> 00:35:09.965
"Tree Foundation." That's amazing. "Hopefully she
will never be short of a tree again when the party

00:35:09.965 --> 00:35:16.275
"needs to fast travel." That's so amazing. "I'd
like to send a huge and heartfelt thank you once

00:35:16.275 --> 00:35:22.868
"again to all of you for the fun and fabulous
storytelling. Love and hearts from Madwife Cinda.

00:35:22.868 --> 00:35:31.794
"P.S. Good luck with the dragons." Thank you. Along
with the four leaf clovers. I think. Anything helps.

00:35:31.794 --> 00:35:39.631
MATT: Dragons are long term. You guys have got a
bunch of feral herd members to worry about this week.

00:35:40.077 --> 00:35:47.233
MARISHA: Yeah. To be fair, they are kind of like,
they have a dragon overlord right now.

00:35:47.233 --> 00:35:47.908
MATT: True.

00:35:47.908 --> 00:35:59.124
MARISHA: So it's kind of both at once. What is--
Oh, look at this!

00:35:59.124 --> 00:36:01.381
MATT: Oh wow. That's so cute.

00:36:01.381 --> 00:36:03.369
MARISHA: It's made out of book.

00:36:03.369 --> 00:36:05.318
MATT: I love it.

00:36:05.318 --> 00:36:12.951
MARISHA: That's so cute. Madwife Cinda. What is
this?

00:36:12.951 --> 00:36:14.801
MATT: Hello to Nova Scotia from us as well.

00:36:14.801 --> 00:36:31.145
MARISHA: Oh my goodness. More books! I always want
more books. Oh my god. Oh dude, what is this? Shut

00:36:31.374 --> 00:36:37.957
up. The standard book of spells.

00:36:37.957 --> 00:36:39.378
MATT: Oh snap.

00:36:39.378 --> 00:36:45.415
MARISHA: That's awesome! And it's a notebook.

00:36:45.415 --> 00:36:53.058
MATT: That's so cool! I love the style on the
inside cover too.

00:36:53.058 --> 00:37:00.881
MARISHA: That's awesome. Oh she got this from the
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. That's

00:37:00.881 --> 00:37:05.433
so cool I got a spellbook! I want to actually
write down--

00:37:05.433 --> 00:37:06.373
MATT: Write your spells in it?

00:37:06.373 --> 00:37:06.812
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:37:06.812 --> 00:37:07.733
MATT: Do it!

00:37:07.733 --> 00:37:09.089
MARISHA: Put spells in it.

00:37:09.089 --> 00:37:11.114
MATT: That your subtle way of saying you do
spells?

00:37:11.407 --> 00:37:18.798
MARISHA: Shut up. I've got a lot of spells, okay?
And I read them and just don't--

00:37:18.798 --> 00:37:20.154
MATT: I'm just teasing you.

00:37:20.154 --> 00:37:21.847
MARSHA: I get it a lot, okay?

00:37:21.847 --> 00:37:25.463
MATT: I know. It's because the internet loves
you.

00:37:25.463 --> 00:37:29.471
MARISHA: Let's see, what else is next?

00:37:29.471 --> 00:37:32.820
MATT: We'll start grabbing from that pile.

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:39.136
MARISHA: I'll open the big one. How about that?

00:37:39.136 --> 00:37:43.812
MATT: Okay, get that knife ready. Marisha's going
to open up the big one.

00:37:43.812 --> 00:37:45.580
MARISHA: You do want to sit in the--

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:50.056
MATT: Yeah, I'll sit in our comfy ottoman that we
bought today for super cheap at a set--

00:37:50.056 --> 00:37:52.954
MARISHA: At warehouse sales because I love cheap
shit.

00:37:52.954 --> 00:37:55.153
MATT: Got to stretch that dollar.

00:37:55.153 --> 00:38:18.678
MARISHA: Not that I like cheap shit, I like things
that are on sale. I'm a frugal bitch. Okay. Sorry.

00:38:18.678 --> 00:38:21.156
Maybe we should pre-open some packages.

00:38:21.156 --> 00:38:28.173
MATT: I know, time was not of the essence. An
outlook of the week.

00:38:28.173 --> 00:38:29.552
MARISHA: We should have thought about that.

00:38:29.552 --> 00:38:31.382
MATT: (sings) Styrofoam, bubble wrap.

00:38:31.382 --> 00:38:36.657
MARISHA: There's a scroll that I think you should
read.

00:38:36.657 --> 00:38:42.600
MATT: Because it has my name on it? Is that a
distinction?

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:45.901
MARISHA: That's one distinction.

00:38:45.901 --> 00:38:52.621
MATT: That's really cool, it's like leather bound
and look at that. You should probably scoot that

00:38:52.621 --> 00:38:55.192
over here, you're kind of back lit. Really dark.

00:38:55.192 --> 00:38:56.281
MARISHA: I'm sorry.

00:38:56.281 --> 00:38:58.133
MATT: That's okay. Oh, what's that?

00:38:58.133 --> 00:39:03.006
MARISHA: I don't know; there's a gift for everybody
in there, but I think you should read the scroll first.

00:39:03.006 --> 00:39:04.062
MATT: Okay. You want to hold this?

00:39:04.062 --> 00:39:04.551
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:39:06.811 --> 00:39:18.989
MATT: A wax seal? Are you kidding me? That's
amazing. I'm such a sucker for presentation. Get

00:39:19.262 --> 00:39:31.336
this open here from the wax seal. If I can just
unseal it we'll be good. It's too sealed. The wax

00:39:31.336 --> 00:39:37.487
has been-- For Vox Machina, it's doors; for me,
it's wax seals.

00:39:37.487 --> 00:39:41.941
MARISHA: (laughs) Hey, that's not funny.

00:39:41.941 --> 00:39:43.582
MATT: I think it's pretty hilarious.

00:39:43.582 --> 00:39:44.338
MARISHA: You would.

00:39:44.338 --> 00:39:45.995
MATT: Scissors come to my aid again.

00:39:45.995 --> 00:39:55.952
MARISHA: Go, scissors, go. I'm going to steal
those scissors after you do. Oh wait, nevermind, I

00:39:55.952 --> 00:39:56.545
got it.

00:39:56.545 --> 00:40:04.292
MATT: I will not lose. There's more? No.

00:40:04.292 --> 00:40:09.841
MARISHA: Now, these are very--

00:40:09.841 --> 00:40:16.482
MATT: Boom. Open. What. Oh, the camera is freaking
out right now. Sorry about that, Marisha decided

00:40:16.482 --> 00:40:18.846
to unwrap the present with you.

00:40:18.846 --> 00:40:22.118
MARISHA: I got bored. Holy crap.

00:40:22.118 --> 00:40:24.913
MATT: What is that?

00:40:24.913 --> 00:40:28.341
MARISHA: A custom Keyleth figure in a box.

00:40:28.341 --> 00:40:29.422
MATT: <i>What!</i>

00:40:29.422 --> 00:40:32.796
MARISHA: Yeah. Oh my god. Take a look at the back.
Look at it!

00:40:32.796 --> 00:40:37.041
MATT: That is ridiculous.

00:40:38.541 --> 00:40:44.770
MARISHA: After your first attempt with the Sun
Tree-- You can try your luck with these. Who

00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:50.309
knows, we may see this used in a game board some
day.

00:40:50.309 --> 00:40:55.953
MATT: Okay, that's like one of the coolest things
to happen ever.

00:40:56.561 --> 00:40:59.184
MARISHA: I know, that's amazing. I've always
wanted to be an action figure. Just want to throw

00:40:59.184 --> 00:40:59.654
that out.

00:40:59.654 --> 00:41:04.037
MATT: Now you are an action figure. What is this?

00:41:04.037 --> 00:41:07.755
MARISHA: Oh cool! Check that shit out!

00:41:08.142 --> 00:41:09.311
MATT: Who is this from?

00:41:09.311 --> 00:41:10.881
MARISHA: I don't know. You had the scroll.

00:41:10.881 --> 00:41:13.998
MATT: I was going to open it but you opened the
presents with the people.

00:41:13.998 --> 00:41:16.889
MARISHA: Well they got a first-person view.

00:41:16.889 --> 00:41:26.135
MATT: This is true. Ah man, all right. "Vox
Machina. I present to you gifts of appreciation

00:41:26.135 --> 00:41:30.805
"and introduction. I, the acquirer of the arcane,
finder of the forgotten, and retriever of the

for a fee of course, non-negotiable, sorry

00:41:35.705 --> 00:41:39.933
"darlings, have two items for the each of you. The
first item is something you may have lost or may

00:41:39.933 --> 00:41:44.067
"be of value in some fashion. The second is
representative of your legend. You have become

00:41:44.067 --> 00:41:48.744
"icons in some circles. Created through alchemy and
tinkering what was once one thing is now another.

00:41:48.744 --> 00:41:54.160
"Thus you shouldn't fear moving it from its
original packaging. Nothing more is asked of you.

00:41:54.160 --> 00:42:01.272
"Just if we happen to cross paths in the future, it
will not be as strangers. Warmest regards, The

00:42:01.272 --> 00:42:12.073
"Devilish Rogue." The Dullish Rogue? This font,
makes it difficult for me to see specifically what

00:42:12.073 --> 00:42:21.749
it said. I'll say them all. The Devilish Rogue,
maybe? I like it. This is awesome.

00:42:21.749 --> 00:42:24.983
MARISHA: This is rad. I need to plant my bonsai
tree stat.

00:42:24.983 --> 00:42:30.892
MATT: I can't believe you got an action figure.
That's so awesome.

00:42:30.892 --> 00:42:33.879
MARISHA: Let me see. You might have a something in
there. Here.

00:42:33.879 --> 00:42:34.589
MATT: Oh no.

00:42:34.589 --> 00:42:45.689
MARISHA: But there's gifts in here for everybody.
Oh yeah. I'll let everyone else open their own.

00:42:45.689 --> 00:42:50.524
MATT: Yeah, we'll give those gifts to everyone
else and let them open them on their time.

00:42:50.964 --> 00:42:53.152
MARISHA: But thank you Devilish Rogue, that's
incredible!

00:42:53.152 --> 00:42:56.933
MATT: Here you go Marisha, hold this over my head.
Never mind.

00:42:56.933 --> 00:42:57.481
MARISHA: Sorry.

00:42:57.481 --> 00:43:02.694
MATT: It's okay. Here you go. We don't have a
fancy switchboard at home, unfortunately. Sorry

00:43:02.694 --> 00:43:08.451
guys. One of these days. We'll have a crew that
runs our Periscopes.

00:43:08.451 --> 00:43:12.293
MARISHA: We could get one of those little foam
tripods?

00:43:12.293 --> 00:43:14.456
MATT: Yeah, like a selfie stick.

00:43:14.456 --> 00:43:19.347
MARISHA: I don't know, we might have a selfie
stick. We moved and I don't know where anything is.

00:43:19.756 --> 00:43:27.030
MATT: Hah! Scissors wins again. Unless it's the
first round of rocks, scissors, paper because

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:41.480
everyone picks scissors, so then rock would win.
(laughs) I <i>did</i> get an action figure! With the

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:47.851
blind wrapped around my face and the wig, the hair
uses my hair. That's so epic.

00:43:47.851 --> 00:43:52.287
MARISHA: (laughs) That's so funny. That's so
great.

00:43:52.287 --> 00:43:56.567
MATT: That's so cool. There are little stories on
the back too.

00:43:56.567 --> 00:43:58.884
MARISHA: I know they put details onto the back--

00:43:58.884 --> 00:44:05.419
MATT: There's a switch in the back and it makes my
eyes glow through the-- <i>What!</i> And it comes with

00:44:05.419 --> 00:44:09.438
a little tome. With chains on it. That's so
badass.

00:44:09.438 --> 00:44:12.449
MARISHA: That's amazing. What else is in there?

00:44:12.449 --> 00:44:20.663
MATT: What to give the one who has two red
dragons? Seriously. Perhaps you can wear this on a

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:34.021
special night to instill a bit of fear. Uh-oh.
Instill a little fear? (laughs) That's really cool.

00:44:34.021 --> 00:44:38.649
MARISHA: The DM rolled a what? (laughs)

00:44:38.649 --> 00:44:41.773
MATT: This is the back of the shirt. The DM rolled
a what, and it's that picture.

00:44:41.773 --> 00:44:47.880
MARISHA: Yup, that's what that looks like. For
sure. That's pretty rad.

00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:51.592
MATT: That's so cool! Thank you, Rogue!

00:44:51.592 --> 00:44:53.608
MARISHA: Thank you, Devilish Rogue!

00:44:53.608 --> 00:45:28.438
MATT: That's so cool. Let's do... This is from D&D
Dice. To Critical Role. Here we go. Oh snap! It's

00:45:28.438 --> 00:45:33.102
a whole cluster of brushed aluminium D20s for the
whole crew.

00:45:33.102 --> 00:45:34.157
MARISHA: Oh shit!

00:45:34.157 --> 00:45:36.242
MATT: That's so cool!

00:45:36.242 --> 00:45:38.033
MARISHA: Oh wow.

00:45:43.523 --> 00:45:45.767
MATT: There's no name on this one.

00:45:45.767 --> 00:45:47.967
MARISHA: There's no name on it? No!

00:45:47.967 --> 00:45:49.150
MATT: Someone...?

00:45:49.150 --> 00:45:52.951
MARISHA: I hate it when this happens.

00:45:52.951 --> 00:45:59.884
MATT: Well, whoever it is that sent us these
awesome metal dice. Thank you so very much. And we

00:45:59.884 --> 00:46:02.345
will be happy to deliver these to the rest of the
team.

00:46:02.345 --> 00:46:11.267
MARISHA: Those are amazing. That's awesome. Thank
you, guys.

00:46:11.676 --> 00:46:13.877
MATT: That's fantastic. All righty.

00:46:13.877 --> 00:46:16.075
MARISHA: D&D Dice.

00:46:16.075 --> 00:46:23.575
MATT: Here you open some. We'll switch it off.

00:46:23.575 --> 00:46:25.444
MARISHA: You want me to open something?

00:46:25.444 --> 00:46:29.578
MATT: Yeah, grab some of the ones over there or
there's some packages on the ground with some tubes.

00:46:30.191 --> 00:46:31.714
MARISHA: I like tubes.

00:46:31.714 --> 00:46:34.438
MATT: Tubes are nice. Tubes are always fun.

00:46:34.438 --> 00:46:41.122
MARISHA: This one is from Helen Drula. From
Wisconsin.

00:46:41.122 --> 00:46:43.203
MATT: Focus curse you. Focus.

00:46:43.203 --> 00:47:08.121
MARISHA: Can you hand me the knife? What did Helen
Drula send from Wisconsin? Oh my god, more cross

00:47:08.121 --> 00:47:16.128
stitch! I have a weakness for anything
cross-stitch. I have a weakness for anything

00:47:16.525 --> 00:47:18.816
handmade. I have a weakness for Critmas.

00:47:18.816 --> 00:47:21.381
MATT: I think that's what it comes down to.

00:47:21.381 --> 00:47:31.867
MARISHA: Hang on, I want to see. Helen Drula. Oh
my god.

00:47:31.867 --> 00:47:33.386
MATT: What the heck is that?

00:47:33.386 --> 00:47:45.356
MARISHA: "TLDR. I wanted to see this phrase on a
nice wall hanging. So I made it. Thanks for the

00:47:45.356 --> 00:47:49.358
"stories. Helen a.k.a. VialsofScience."

00:47:49.358 --> 00:47:51.625
MATT: Thank you Helen, VialsofScience.

00:47:51.625 --> 00:47:53.545
MARISHA: Matt, hang on let me--

00:47:53.545 --> 00:47:55.180
MATT: I just want to see it.

00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:56.755
MARISHA: Let me make it--

00:47:56.755 --> 00:47:58.969
MATT: Oh it's like a banner. Oh snap.

00:47:58.969 --> 00:47:59.714
MARISHA: Hang on.

00:47:59.714 --> 00:48:01.475
MATT: Oh that's going to go up in the house.

00:48:01.475 --> 00:48:10.138
MARISHA: Yeah. The benefit of no one else being
here is we get to claim it first. (laughs)

00:48:10.138 --> 00:48:14.857
MATT: Oh that's so cool.

00:48:14.857 --> 00:48:17.929
MARISHA: Plus, I mean it kind of is like <i>your</i>
saying.

00:48:17.929 --> 00:48:22.068
MATT: It's so crazy to me. It's so crazy to think
that that's like a saying now.

00:48:22.068 --> 00:48:23.451
MARISHA: I know.

00:48:23.451 --> 00:48:29.064
MATT: I just made it up at a table years ago and
now other people are using now. You have it on

00:48:29.064 --> 00:48:30.845
your sweater. That's so stupid.

00:48:30.845 --> 00:48:37.465
MARISHA: I'll never forget when it clicked, when
we saw the other Critter game. And they said,

00:48:37.465 --> 00:48:41.751
"Okay guys, how do you want to do this?" and
everyone starting laughing. And I was like--

00:48:41.751 --> 00:48:43.485
MATT: Oh it's a thing now.

00:48:43.485 --> 00:48:50.347
MARISHA: Oh, it's weird. It's like that moment in
The Social Network and they're like, "She just

00:48:50.347 --> 00:48:52.275
"said Facebook me."

00:48:52.275 --> 00:48:56.077
MATT: Kind of. On a much smaller, less douchey
scale.

00:48:56.459 --> 00:49:00.565
MARISHA: Yeah, totally. But that same feeling is
what it evokes.

00:49:00.565 --> 00:49:05.984
MATT: Yeah. That's crazy. Thank you! Thank you,
Helen!

00:49:05.984 --> 00:49:11.154
MARISHA: Thank you, Helen! I love her TLDR note.

00:49:11.154 --> 00:49:12.092
MATT: It's pretty great.

00:49:12.092 --> 00:49:14.513
MARISHA: Let's see what the other tube-y tube is.

00:49:14.513 --> 00:49:16.118
MATT: (singing) Tube-y tube!

00:49:33.618 --> 00:49:40.934
MARISHA: (laughs) What is this?

00:49:40.934 --> 00:49:42.662
MATT: It looks golden.

00:49:42.662 --> 00:49:52.278
MARISHA: (exclamations) Oh my god! It's a giant
card.

00:49:52.278 --> 00:49:53.383
MATT: What?

00:49:53.383 --> 00:49:56.289
MARISHA: Happy 50th episode!

00:49:56.289 --> 00:50:05.408
MATT: Oh that's awesome! That's a really big card.
That's a big card.

00:50:05.408 --> 00:50:12.252
MARISHA: "Thanks for sharing your world with us.
Happy 50th episode." Lauren @dragonmustang01.

00:50:12.555 --> 00:50:15.862
"Thank you for the greatest story ever told.
You're all wonderful and I'm so grateful for

00:50:15.862 --> 00:50:21.602
"Critical Role." Love, uh... signature. "Thank you
for sharing your wonderful world with us. Here's

00:50:21.602 --> 00:50:29.323
"to 50 fantastic more episodes. It means more to us
than you know." @roar_itsmonzy.

00:50:29.323 --> 00:50:32.207
MATT: There's also dragonmustang01 up top.

00:50:32.207 --> 00:50:33.893
MARISHA: Yeah, I said dragonmustang. Lauren.

00:50:33.893 --> 00:50:34.702
MATT: That's so cool.

00:50:34.702 --> 00:50:39.902
MARISHA: "Congratulations, Vox Machina." And they
have amazing thank you notes.

00:50:39.902 --> 00:50:43.830
MATT: Ashley's in LA. We have her for a few months
before she has to go back to New York, so Pike

00:50:43.830 --> 00:50:46.890
will be joining us in person for a while. Yay!

00:50:46.890 --> 00:50:50.922
MARISHA: It's a P.S. "Vex, this card is worth
about 35 gold."

00:50:50.922 --> 00:50:52.315
MATT: That's so cool.

00:50:52.315 --> 00:50:55.675
MARISHA: That's amazing. I love that.

00:50:55.675 --> 00:50:57.177
MATT: Thank you, guys!

00:50:57.177 --> 00:51:05.426
MARISHA: Just a giant 50th episode card. That is
so cute. Thank you, guys! I have to figure out how

00:51:05.426 --> 00:51:11.889
I'm going to put that with all my other cards that
I keep. It won't fit in the box that I usually

00:51:11.889 --> 00:51:13.540
keep them in.

00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:20.353
MATT: It will fit into <i>that</i> box, the round one
that it came in. (laughs)

00:51:20.353 --> 00:51:23.149
MARISHA: Okay. You want to do one?

00:51:23.149 --> 00:51:25.976
MATT: That package right there behind you.

00:51:25.976 --> 00:51:26.934
MARISHA: This?

00:51:26.934 --> 00:51:27.989
MATT: Yeah.

00:51:27.989 --> 00:51:30.009
MARISHA: (snorts, laughs)

00:51:30.009 --> 00:51:34.618
MATT: And she fell for it! Forever on the
Internet.

00:51:34.618 --> 00:51:35.965
MARISHA: I caught myself.

00:51:35.965 --> 00:51:42.541
MATT: You did. It was pretty awesome. (laughs)
That was so adorable.

00:51:42.541 --> 00:51:51.602
MARISHA: (laughs) Shut up. I'm still getting used
to the ottoman, all right? It's new.

00:51:51.602 --> 00:51:52.875
MATT: It's very new.

00:51:53.239 --> 00:51:57.048
MARISHA: Uhh-- (exclaims)--

00:51:57.339 --> 00:51:58.966
MATT: (laughs) Failed dex save.

00:51:58.966 --> 00:52:07.636
MARISHA: (laughs) Shut up, you guys! I just had
800 people watch me eat it. Okay. Oh, this is for

00:52:07.636 --> 00:52:09.796
Vex. This is for Vex.

00:52:09.796 --> 00:52:12.309
MATT: Yeah, what is it?

00:52:12.309 --> 00:52:19.032
MARISHA: They always send a thousand cards and I
have to figure out which one is the right one that

00:52:19.032 --> 00:52:27.695
I want. Okay. "Hi, Vex'ahlia. On my next paycheck,
I'm sending donations of two of the charities

00:52:27.695 --> 00:52:32.641
listed for everyone on the Critter's Guide. I
really wanted to send you a bear and a gift for

00:52:32.641 --> 00:52:49.011
chat for my first gifts to you all." @elderthrud
on Instagram. And he sent this amazing elven dice bag.

00:52:49.011 --> 00:52:50.027
MATT: Oh whoa!

00:52:50.027 --> 00:52:54.159
MARISHA: With elven opaque, slightly
see-through--

00:52:54.159 --> 00:52:56.167
MATT: Oh those are cool. I haven't seen those.

00:52:56.167 --> 00:53:02.949
MARISHA: I know! I haven't seen these at all. They
have a bunch of different kinds, too, which are

00:53:02.949 --> 00:53:05.602
really rad. That's cool.

00:53:05.602 --> 00:53:08.995
MATT: That's fantastic. Cool. We'll make sure to
put those over in the Laura/Vex pile.

00:53:08.995 --> 00:53:16.245
MARISHA: Put this in the Laura pile! (singing
nonsense)

00:53:16.245 --> 00:53:21.702
MATT: Me and Liam will be players today at 9:30pm
Pacific time to join Ivan for a game with quite a

00:53:21.702 --> 00:53:23.322
few other folks, so--

00:53:23.322 --> 00:53:28.383
MARISHA: I'm going to be spending it with my dad.
I hope you guys understand. My father is in town,

00:53:28.383 --> 00:53:30.535
so dad time.

00:53:30.535 --> 00:53:31.853
MATT: Want to switch around?

00:53:31.853 --> 00:53:32.221
MARISHA: Yeah!

00:53:32.221 --> 00:53:37.314
MATT: All right.

00:53:37.314 --> 00:53:37.825
MARISHA: Okay.

00:53:37.825 --> 00:53:45.994
MATT: Just going to-- maybe not sit on your knife.
(laughs) And that was the-- we've already done

00:53:46.288 --> 00:53:51.341
that one. All right. Let's-- I'll just grab
these.

00:53:51.341 --> 00:53:53.588
MARISHA: There you go.

00:53:53.588 --> 00:53:58.181
MATT: We're getting to the bigger stuff now. The
big thing. Marisha already pulled out a bunch of

00:53:58.181 --> 00:53:59.478
the tinier things.

00:53:59.478 --> 00:54:00.196
MARISHA: Yeah!

00:54:00.196 --> 00:54:06.751
MATT: So it's kind of like a fun reveal. All
righty. This is from Kathleen Nelson. Looks like

00:54:06.751 --> 00:54:08.770
this is also to Grog.

00:54:08.770 --> 00:54:09.761
MARISHA: Grog.

00:54:09.761 --> 00:54:24.336
MATT: Get ready to put this over on the pile.
There's a letter to Grog Strongjaw and for me to read

00:54:24.336 --> 00:54:32.357
off the air, which I will do. It says, "Master
Grog Strongjaw and Vox Machina, Kord's strength to

00:54:32.357 --> 00:54:37.408
"you. Word of your meeting with Earthbreaker Groon
has spread from the temple in Vasselheim to all

00:54:37.408 --> 00:54:47.967
"servants of Kord, advising us to render whatever
aid and assistance we're able to in your quest to

00:54:47.967 --> 00:54:54.489
"defeat the Chroma Conclave. My name is Rain and I
serve Kord as one of his clerics." Oh! (laughs) Oh

00:54:54.489 --> 00:54:57.082
this is cool! It's got individual messages for
Pike as well. From Payne, a bronze dragonborn, AKA

00:54:57.082 --> 00:54:58.311
Kathleen Nelson. @starstuff84

00:54:58.311 --> 00:54:58.819
MARISHA: Starstuff.

00:54:59.078 --> 00:55:07.926
MATT: That's so cool! Oh it's a-- I love getting
written letters. What lies inside here for our

00:55:07.926 --> 00:55:17.063
fair Grog? Let us see. Oh, it's got little stone
necklaces for everybody!

00:55:17.063 --> 00:55:17.627
MARISHA: Aw!

00:55:17.627 --> 00:55:19.333
MATT: That's so cool.

00:55:19.333 --> 00:55:22.047
MARISHA: For everybody? Oh my goodness!

00:55:22.047 --> 00:55:25.654
MATT: Pieces of Fulgurite.

00:55:25.654 --> 00:55:27.250
MARISHA: Fulgurite?

00:55:27.250 --> 00:55:30.974
MATT: It's formed when lightning strikes sand,
fusing the individual grains into tubes of glass.

00:55:30.974 --> 00:55:33.728
MARISHA: Oh! That's dope!

00:55:33.728 --> 00:55:35.341
MATT: That's rad!

00:55:35.341 --> 00:55:38.624
MARISHA and MATT: That's so cool.

00:55:38.624 --> 00:55:40.926
MARISHA: So many hearts!

00:55:40.926 --> 00:55:42.854
MATT: Okay, so this is for everybody.

00:55:42.854 --> 00:55:47.239
MARISHA: It's heartsplosion. Heartsplosion!

00:55:47.239 --> 00:55:53.749
MATT: With little necklace pieces for everybody.
Well, since we're opening them, I'm going to take

00:55:54.121 --> 00:56:07.025
first grasp on these. That's probably for Pike,
though. I'll take these two for us, and then, Percy--

00:56:07.025 --> 00:56:10.303
MARISHA: Let me see! I want to see!

00:56:10.303 --> 00:56:15.653
MATT: --Scanlan, Keyleth-- there we go.

00:56:15.653 --> 00:56:23.716
MATT: Which one do you want of these for yourself?
Which color of these cords do you want? Cords from

00:56:23.716 --> 00:56:24.561
Kord. Get it?

00:56:24.561 --> 00:56:29.657
MARISHA: Cords form Kord. I like the dark brown.
Yeah, that one.

00:56:29.657 --> 00:56:30.806
MATT: There you go.

00:56:30.806 --> 00:56:31.222
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:56:31.222 --> 00:56:34.759
MATT: All the rest of these are for the rest of
Vox Machina. We better put them away.

00:56:34.759 --> 00:56:41.488
MARISHA: Oh, that is so cool. Let me see if I can
get a good focus on this.

00:56:41.488 --> 00:56:45.271
MATT: That is so cool. I'll make sure this gets to
everybody else.

00:56:45.271 --> 00:56:58.119
MARISHA: Yeah, that's rad. A little glass tube,
that's crazy. Cool.

00:56:58.119 --> 00:57:01.969
MATT: Look at that. Landed right in the pile.

00:57:01.969 --> 00:57:04.430
MARISHA: No one saw it.

00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:07.210
MATT: But I did and that's all that mattered.

00:57:07.210 --> 00:57:09.054
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:57:09.054 --> 00:57:14.423
MATT: Shut up. This is from Fallon Burress from
Louisville, Kentucky.

00:57:14.423 --> 00:57:18.223
MARISHA: Ay-oh! Fallon!

00:57:18.223 --> 00:57:21.969
MATT: All righty.

00:57:27.699 --> 00:57:28.472
MARISHA: Chop.

00:57:28.472 --> 00:57:45.770
MATT: Oh snap. "Dear Vox Machina, I began these
boxes while Tiberius was still on the show. I

00:57:46.073 --> 00:57:49.952
"wanted to see the amazing boxes from Wyrmwood, but
I thought, 'Fuck it.' So here are the same dice

00:57:49.952 --> 00:57:54.347
"boxes--" They've been working on this for a while.
"--individualized for each of you. Everything is

00:57:54.347 --> 00:57:59.443
"handmade, wood-burned, stained, and glued together
myself." From Fallon Burress, aka Hippy Cannibal.

00:57:59.443 --> 00:58:00.987
MARISHA: Hippy Cannibal!

00:58:00.987 --> 00:58:06.655
MATT: Custom made, with Grog's name on the back.

00:58:06.655 --> 00:58:15.117
MARISHA: They put little cave men drawings
because it's Grog.

00:58:15.117 --> 00:58:25.332
MATT: That's so cool. They've got one for
Taliesin. These are really cool. Laura. Sam's is

00:58:25.332 --> 00:58:26.906
all purple colored, too.

00:58:26.906 --> 00:58:27.764
MARISHA: Perfect.

00:58:27.764 --> 00:58:36.288
MATT: Ashley. This one's for you, Marisha. They've
got one for Liam, too.

00:58:36.709 --> 00:58:41.190
MARISHA: Let me see. Oh! That's so cute! Oh, it's
got air symbols in it.

00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:43.254
MATT: That's badass.

00:58:43.254 --> 00:58:55.680
MARISHA: It's got all sorts of different symbols
that mean air, which is fantastic. Oh, and water.

00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:58.418
It's got elemental signs.

00:58:58.418 --> 00:59:00.599
MATT: Look at the fire side has Charizard!

00:59:00.599 --> 00:59:02.151
MARISHA: Does it have Charizard?

00:59:02.151 --> 00:59:03.562
MATT: And the Fire Nation symbol.

00:59:03.562 --> 00:59:05.061
MARISHA: Oh, that's so funny!

00:59:05.061 --> 00:59:07.118
MATT: It's got a Pokemon on each side.

00:59:07.118 --> 00:59:12.540
MARISHA: They each have Pokemon! That's so funny
to have each of them.

00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:14.553
MATT: Oh, and it's got The 5th Element symbol for
the air.

00:59:14.553 --> 00:59:16.292
MARISHA: That's so perfect.

00:59:16.292 --> 00:59:21.614
MATT: That's great. Fallon says, "Sorry I ran out
of time to make [me] a box." Don't worry about it,

00:59:21.614 --> 00:59:29.117
buddy. These are fantastic. "Thanks for all the DM
tips. They tremendously helped with my campaign.

00:59:29.117 --> 00:59:35.653
"Thank you for making this amazing world, and
letting us all be part of it." Of course, thank

00:59:35.653 --> 00:59:43.784
you for coming along. "I hope I can convince you
to come to--" E-ville Con? I think it is? I think

00:59:43.784 --> 00:59:50.523
it must be a Louisville con. "--as a guest in the
future." Well, tell them you're interested in

00:59:50.523 --> 00:59:56.028
having me as a guest. They have to invite us.
That's how it works. That's so cool. Fallon,

00:59:56.028 --> 00:59:59.269
amazing gift. We're going to make sure the rest of
the cast get these.

00:59:59.269 --> 01:00:00.690
MARISHA: That's awesome.

01:00:00.690 --> 01:00:08.139
MATT: Next box. This is from Mark Ball, also from
Louisville, Kentucky.

01:00:08.139 --> 01:00:12.860
MARISHA: Oh, lots of Kentucky! It's because my
dad's in town. That's why.

01:00:13.210 --> 01:00:14.052
MATT: That's probably why.

01:00:14.052 --> 01:00:15.148
MARISHA: He brought the essence.

01:00:15.148 --> 01:00:30.842
MATT: This one's got packing peanuts, oh no! My
nemesis! Oh, oh no.

01:00:31.155 --> 01:00:38.740
MARISHIA: Oh no, is it something a Kentucky person
would do, like send a bunch of bourbon? Oh no!

01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:42.135
MATT: (Evil laughter)

01:00:42.135 --> 01:00:49.488
MARISHA: Oh no, you are feeding into his sickness.
What is wrong with you, enablers?

01:00:49.488 --> 01:00:57.022
MATT: Oh snap, and here's one for Liam.

01:00:57.022 --> 01:00:58.807
MARISHA: Oh Liam! He's going to be stoked.

01:00:58.807 --> 01:01:02.152
MATT: Liam was in the chat earlier. Liam, if
you're still watching, you got a box coming your

01:01:02.152 --> 01:01:02.745
way, too.

01:01:02.745 --> 01:01:05.465
MARISHA: Oh, that's so great.

01:01:05.465 --> 01:01:13.354
MATT: Thanks to our fine friend, Mark Ball from
Louisville, Kentucky. That's fantastic. I may have

01:01:13.354 --> 01:01:15.224
to open mine at the end of this.

01:01:15.224 --> 01:01:18.632
MARISHA: Man, fucking guys is named Mark from
Louisville, am I right?

01:01:18.632 --> 01:01:35.214
MATT: Yeah. (laughter) Oh, no! You stay in there!
(giggling) Put this aside for Liam. Oh, this is

01:01:35.214 --> 01:01:39.966
mine? I'll open this here in a little bit. Liam's
will be over here. Marisha, want to open some now?

01:01:40.328 --> 01:01:40.882
MARISHA: Sure.

01:01:40.882 --> 01:01:45.344
MATT: All right. This will go to Liam. I'll bring
it to him tonight.

01:01:45.344 --> 01:01:47.702
MARISHA: The spoils table.

01:01:47.702 --> 01:01:52.894
MATT: "They bought this house for [my] minis
collection." Pretty much.

01:01:52.894 --> 01:02:01.600
MARISHA: Yeah. I saw someone on Twitter be like,
"Wait, did they all actually have to move because

01:02:01.990 --> 01:02:08.546
they need more room for stuff?" No, but kind of,
but no.

01:02:08.546 --> 01:02:12.008
MATT: BananaMcGee did a great job on that
Bangarang video! That was awesome! All right,

01:02:12.008 --> 01:02:14.469
Marisha's got a handful over here.

01:02:14.469 --> 01:02:27.829
MARISHA: Okay. Where is the knife? Okay, this one
is from--

01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:30.493
MATT: From?

01:02:30.493 --> 01:02:34.211
MARISHA: From Ariel Hauptman?

01:02:34.211 --> 01:02:36.218
MATT: Ariel Hauptman.

01:02:36.218 --> 01:03:07.912
MARISHA: Greyston Bakery. Which I like the sound
of already. The Best Brownie. Oh my god, I think

01:03:08.365 --> 01:03:12.839
it's-- "Dear cast and crew of Critical Role, Thank
you for sharing your creativity and joy with us

01:03:12.839 --> 01:03:18.477
"all. These brownies are but a small token of
thanks, and while you get delicious treats, the

01:03:18.477 --> 01:03:24.417
"money goes to a great cause. Greyston is a
wonderful company devoted to lifting people out of

01:03:24.417 --> 01:03:32.017
"poverty in southwest Yonkers--" In Yonkers New
York, "--by providing employment, skills training,

01:03:32.017 --> 01:03:38.442
"housing, childcare resources, and more to the
community." That's amazing. The best brownie.

01:03:38.442 --> 01:03:39.011
MATT: That's great.

01:03:39.011 --> 01:03:44.446
MARISHA: Yep. "Each brownie represents a job that
is self sufficient, and success among people who

01:03:44.446 --> 01:03:50.391
"want an opportunity to succeed. And that's what
is even sweeter is that when you bite into our

01:03:50.391 --> 01:03:56.260
"Best Brownie, you become part of our solution
to end poverty." That's amazing. That's

01:03:56.260 --> 01:04:02.283
the Greyston Bakery in Yonkers.
Fucking love brownies!

01:04:02.283 --> 01:04:08.017
MATT: Aww, that's so cute. Aww. As a note, guys,
be careful about sending perishables. If they can

01:04:08.441 --> 01:04:09.528
last a few weeks, it's totally fine--

01:04:09.528 --> 01:04:10.626
MARISHA: Well, these are packaged.

01:04:10.626 --> 01:04:16.421
MATT: Yeah, those are packaged, which is why those
are fine. We've had people send a cake before and

01:04:16.421 --> 01:04:21.067
it was an awesome cake, but I think it just barely
got to us in time before it soured, so be careful.

01:04:21.067 --> 01:04:28.156
MARISHA: Brown sugar blondies or chocolate fudge
brownies. I want a brown sugar blondie right now.

01:04:28.563 --> 01:04:30.195
MATT: Rock it, do it. I'll take one.

01:04:30.195 --> 01:04:31.235
MARISHA: You want one?

01:04:31.235 --> 01:04:33.036
MATT: I'll take one, too.

01:04:33.036 --> 01:04:42.963
MARISHA: Hey, Dad! You want a brownie? That's
amazing. This one's addressed to Sam.

01:04:42.963 --> 01:04:50.687
MATT: Well, see what they sent Sam, then. It's fun
to see-- It's very good to open other people's presents.

01:04:50.687 --> 01:04:57.545
MARISHA: I know. It feels weird though. It feels
like opening other people's mail.

01:04:57.545 --> 01:04:59.270
MARK: Yes?

01:04:59.270 --> 01:05:04.314
MARISHA: You want a brownie? Someone sent us a
package of brownies from Yonkers.

01:05:04.314 --> 01:05:05.275
MARK: Heck yeah!

01:05:05.275 --> 01:05:12.771
MARISHA: There's a chocolate fudge brownie or a
brown sugar blondie. Blondie? That's what I went

01:05:12.771 --> 01:05:13.936
for as well.

01:05:13.936 --> 01:05:18.739
MARK: Thank you so much. It's what I needed!

01:05:18.739 --> 01:05:19.697
MATT: Boom.

01:05:19.697 --> 01:05:23.130
MARK: Yeah, needed some energy! Thank you.

01:05:23.130 --> 01:05:25.261
MARISHA: (laughs) Okay.

01:05:25.261 --> 01:05:29.741
MATT: Everyone says, "Hi, Marisha's dad!" Is it
good?

01:05:29.741 --> 01:05:31.291
MARK: My god, so good.

01:05:31.291 --> 01:05:35.790
MARISHA: It's from the Greyston Bakery in
Yonkers.

01:05:35.790 --> 01:05:36.862
MARK: My lord.

01:05:36.862 --> 01:05:39.739
MARISHA: Is it really good? Yeah?

01:05:39.739 --> 01:05:42.802
MARK: Good stuff!

01:05:42.802 --> 01:05:50.445
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to keep going.

01:05:50.445 --> 01:05:51.574
MATT: "Hi Dadleth."

01:05:51.574 --> 01:06:00.569
MARISHA: It's Dadleth! Happy, oh my god! Happy
Father's Day, Scanlan!

01:06:00.569 --> 01:06:01.358
MATT: Aww!

01:06:01.358 --> 01:06:08.241
MARISHA: "Just a small craft project, I thought
you would enjoy as an early Father's Day gift, and

01:06:08.241 --> 01:06:13.435
"I am sure Kaylie would thoroughly approve of you
receiving."

01:06:13.821 --> 01:06:15.965
MATT: Who's it from? Does it say?

01:06:15.965 --> 01:06:21.318
MARISHA: It just says "ZZ," the initials at the
bottom.

01:06:21.318 --> 01:06:24.872
MATT: Okay, should we wait, let Sam open that?

01:06:24.872 --> 01:06:30.794
MARISHA: Christine M. Miller. Yeah, I think so.
Right? This one feels a little more personal right?

01:06:30.794 --> 01:06:32.989
MATT: Yeah, we'll leave that one for Sam to open
on his own.

01:06:32.989 --> 01:06:37.878
MARISHA: Christine M. Miller, this already seems
fantastic. We'll make sure Sam gets it.

01:06:37.878 --> 01:06:40.456
MATT: That's so sweet.

01:06:40.456 --> 01:06:46.558
MARISHA: It's very beautifully wrapped. Okay, I'll
put that in the--

01:06:46.558 --> 01:06:48.707
MATT: Scanlan. Open another one.

01:06:48.707 --> 01:06:57.042
MARISHA: This is from... doesn't say.

01:06:57.042 --> 01:06:58.756
MATT: Everyone's saying they think it's a box of
poop.

01:06:58.756 --> 01:07:00.489
MARISHA: A box of poop!

01:07:00.489 --> 01:07:02.190
MATT: From Kaylie.

01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:12.888
MATT: That brownie was really good.

01:07:12.888 --> 01:07:17.046
MARISHA: I didn't get around to opening mine, it
was taking too long.

01:07:17.508 --> 01:07:22.630
MATT: Everyone's like, "Away from yourself with
the knife, away!"

01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:23.511
MARISHA: I was.

01:07:23.511 --> 01:07:27.655
MATT: I know. They're so worried about watching
you actually cut yourself.

01:07:27.655 --> 01:07:49.832
MARISHA: I'm fine, I'm good. It is a box of a
bunch of really adorable Japanese candies. Oh my

01:07:49.832 --> 01:07:54.876
god, and they got the Kit Kats. Are there the
green tea Kit Kats in here? Oh, they got the

01:07:54.876 --> 01:08:00.081
strawberry Kit Kats. Yeah, they do have the green
tea Kit Kats! These are the best! I don't know who

01:08:00.081 --> 01:08:02.103
sent this, though.

01:08:02.103 --> 01:08:05.678
MATT: Is it like the special Japanese Kit Kat
flavors that you can't get over here?

01:08:05.678 --> 01:08:06.083
MARISHA: Yes.

01:08:06.083 --> 01:08:12.552
MATT: Ooh, green tea Kit Kats are the best Kit
Kats.

01:08:12.552 --> 01:08:17.242
MARISHA: Citrus Kit Kats? What?

01:08:17.242 --> 01:08:19.669
MATT: What? That's a thing?!

01:08:19.669 --> 01:08:22.701
MARISHA: What? Oh my god, cheesecake Kit Kats.

01:08:22.701 --> 01:08:25.769
MATT: (laughs) Why is Japan so much better at Kit
Kats?

01:08:25.769 --> 01:08:35.777
MARISHA: And grape-wine flavored Kit Kat, because
it had a glass of wine on it. Who is this from?

01:08:35.777 --> 01:08:40.220
MATT: Bless the mad scientists over in good old
Nippon.

01:08:40.220 --> 01:08:43.493
MARISHA: That's a loosely wrapped cookie.

01:08:43.984 --> 01:08:46.654
MATT: (laughs)

01:08:46.654 --> 01:08:52.320
MARISHA: (laughing) I'm trying-- I'm genuinely
looking for--

01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:57.059
MATT: Upside-down, a little bit over.

01:08:57.059 --> 01:09:00.346
MARISHA: Oh, here we go, oh.

01:09:00.346 --> 01:09:01.909
MATT: Yeah.

01:09:01.909 --> 01:09:07.514
MARISHA: No, it wasn't, but I found a letter. It's
at the bottom.

01:09:07.514 --> 01:09:08.859
MATT: That's good.

01:09:08.859 --> 01:09:19.541
MARISHA: (humming) "Dear Critical Role, Thank you
for your--" handwritten letters! Crazy. "Thank you

01:09:19.541 --> 01:09:23.584
"for your weekly entertainment and allowing us into
your fantastical world. I'm currently suffering

01:09:23.584 --> 01:09:31.112
"from massive withdrawal having missed the last two
episodes while I was in Japan. I have sent you

01:09:31.112 --> 01:09:36.169
"some of the candy and sweets I found interesting
while I was there." Heck yes, you did! "I'm sorry,

01:09:36.169 --> 01:09:42.777
"but I don't know what most of it is. I hope you
enjoy it regardless. I apologize for the wasabi

01:09:42.777 --> 01:09:44.685
"Kit Kat in advance."

01:09:44.685 --> 01:09:52.246
MATT: (scared laughter) Ooh, and there's the
twist, and that's the Stephen King plot twist

01:09:52.246 --> 01:09:52.694
right there.

01:09:52.694 --> 01:10:04.292
MARISHA: Sincerely, Lindsey R. @crazedred in chat
or @IAmR_Arrow on Twitter.

01:10:04.292 --> 01:10:07.653
MATT: (laughs) That's so awesome. Thank you so
much!

01:10:07.653 --> 01:10:12.086
MARISHA: And she'll have plenty to catch up on
when she gets back from Japan. If she's not

01:10:12.086 --> 01:10:13.648
already back from Japan.

01:10:13.648 --> 01:10:14.864
MATT: Thank you so much!

01:10:14.864 --> 01:10:20.853
MARISHA: Thank you so much! That's amazing! Oh my
God. There's so many that I need to send you, this

01:10:20.853 --> 01:10:24.905
green tea Kit Kat right now, I need it in my-- Oh,
wait. Is that the wasabi one? You know, I kind

01:10:24.905 --> 01:10:26.567
of-- I don't know, actually.

01:10:26.567 --> 01:10:30.779
MATT: All right, we're down to, like, the last
nine boxes?

01:10:30.779 --> 01:10:48.327
MARISHA: Uh-huh. I'm going to open this blondie
with scissors. I'm going to go get more.

01:10:48.327 --> 01:10:54.433
MATT: Oh, you won the expansion? That's awesome!

01:10:54.990 --> 01:11:13.792
MARISHA: (muffled) Boy, they weren't kidding.
Okay. This is from Sarah Hart. Sarah Hart from Missouri.

01:11:13.792 --> 01:11:17.103
MATT: Sorry, I was distracted eating a brownie.

01:11:17.103 --> 01:11:20.688
MARISHA: Right? No, what's MI? Michigan?
Michigan.

01:11:20.688 --> 01:11:31.284
MATT: Mii! Sarah from Mii! Packaging fluff?

01:11:31.284 --> 01:11:31.856
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:11:31.856 --> 01:11:34.019
MATT: Yeah, that stuff in packages will get
everywhere.

01:11:34.019 --> 01:11:44.633
MARISHA: Yeah, I didn't realize. Okay. These are
individual boxes for each person in here.

01:11:44.633 --> 01:11:56.871
MATT: Appreciate you understanding. It's about
four to six hours of prep each game. Sometimes a

01:11:57.229 --> 01:11:58.395
little longer, depending.

01:12:01.815 --> 01:12:06.854
MARISHA: This is a really-- this is from
@earthquakedgirl.

01:12:07.258 --> 01:12:09.353
MATT: Oh, hello @earthquakedgirl.

01:12:09.353 --> 01:12:31.334
MARISHA: On Twitter. Missouri. Right? And this is
a really great letter that I should maybe not read.

01:12:31.334 --> 01:12:36.242
MATT: I'm glad you guys are liking the Dwarven
Forge sets. I've been using them when it seems

01:12:36.242 --> 01:12:41.217
fitting. I'll still make maps and mats and things,
but Dwarven Forge I'm using--

01:12:41.217 --> 01:12:43.716
MARISHA: She also sent individual letters for
everybody? Holy crap.

01:12:43.716 --> 01:12:45.307
MATT: She sent individual letters?

01:12:45.307 --> 01:12:51.059
MARISHA: Packaging fluff everywhere. What? I did
not know what I was getting into with that. Oh,

01:12:51.059 --> 01:13:07.366
man. Oh! These are amazing little boxes! They're
amazing little dice boxes. These are great.

01:13:07.366 --> 01:13:19.934
There's Laura's. Oh! She sent the ladies little
jewelry boxes.

01:13:19.934 --> 01:13:20.882
MATT: That's so cute.

01:13:20.882 --> 01:13:27.408
MARISHA: And she also each sends us letters as
well. Thank you so much, Sarah. That is so sweet.

01:13:27.408 --> 01:13:33.740
Okay, we'll have to make sure Ashley and Laura
gets those. That's awesome. It's got little gold

01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:35.397
leaf right on it. That's great.

01:13:35.397 --> 01:13:38.881
MATT: All right, thank you so much.

01:13:38.881 --> 01:13:43.637
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to trade off with you.
Let me get rid of this.

01:13:44.075 --> 01:13:55.562
MATT: Yeah, those Dwarven Forge sets are even
possible because of you guys supporting the show.

01:13:55.562 --> 01:14:04.832
All your guys' support has enabled us to get
better lights and get better set pieces and do

01:14:04.832 --> 01:14:12.311
more ancillary content and stuff. So yeah, thank
you guys for that. Waiting for Marisha to come

01:14:12.311 --> 01:14:19.704
back, here. But yes. Of course. Happy belated
birthday, though I wished you happy birthday

01:14:19.704 --> 01:14:25.147
already, Meghan, happy birthday as well. All
right, so here she is.

01:14:31.917 --> 01:14:36.653
MARISHA: Where'd that brownie go?

01:14:38.906 --> 01:14:44.957
MATT: This is for Laura, Japanese candy. Okay,
this I already opened, I know what it is because

01:14:45.429 --> 01:14:48.494
it says on the box, "If received after Critmas,
open immediately," and I was afraid it was, like,

01:14:48.494 --> 01:14:57.025
a gerbil. So I opened it, and it comes with this
amazing, "Congratulations, Critical Role, on 50

01:14:57.025 --> 01:15:07.602
"amazing episodes," carved, looks legit. Which is
really cool. And a heart on the inside. It says,

01:15:07.602 --> 01:15:11.407
"Dear cast and crew of Critical Role: thank you
for all the amazing hours you've given us to

01:15:11.407 --> 01:15:16.158
"explore worlds beyond. In honor of your 50th
episode, I've sent you two dozen handmade roses to

01:15:16.158 --> 01:15:19.674
"distribute among the cast, crew, and guests as you
see fit, so thank you again. Here's hoping for 50

01:15:19.674 --> 01:15:24.787
"more. Sincerely, Amnie S. Clark." Amnie. Amnie S.
Clark. She actually spells it out for me so I can

01:15:24.787 --> 01:15:31.014
say it right. Thank you. @storiesanddreams,
ArtByAmnie, and SilverWhispers on DeviantArt.

01:15:31.014 --> 01:15:33.705
Awesome, she's actually sent us a bunch of other
stuff as well.

01:15:33.705 --> 01:15:35.200
MARISHA: Oh, Amnie!

01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:43.616
MATT: Oh, shit! I didn't get this far into it. Oh,
that's so cool.

01:15:43.616 --> 01:15:47.311
MARISHA: Whoa!

01:15:47.311 --> 01:15:52.444
MATT: Falling off. How cool is that?

01:15:52.444 --> 01:15:59.910
MARISHA: She even packaged them like with floral
arrangements! That's so fantastic.

01:15:59.910 --> 01:16:09.354
MATT: That's so cool. Amnie, thank you so much.
That took a while. Have you shown the people what

01:16:09.354 --> 01:16:11.554
you did with the paper cranes, or the paper
dragons, yet?

01:16:11.554 --> 01:16:16.367
MARISHA: I Tweeted it out. Well, I Tweeted out the
jar. I haven't Tweeted out the lamp, because it

01:16:16.367 --> 01:16:20.493
was still needing to be repaired. So we'll show
them.

01:16:20.493 --> 01:16:24.618
MATT: We'll show them in time. Okay. Amnie, that's
amazing. Thank you so much. I'll hold on to that

01:16:24.618 --> 01:16:25.635
one there.

01:16:25.635 --> 01:16:27.255
MARISHA: Incredible.

01:16:27.255 --> 01:16:33.890
MATT: All righty. What have we got here? This is
from R.C. Boys. I don't think that's who sent it.

01:16:33.890 --> 01:16:38.159
I think that was the shipping company or the--
wherever it was purchased from, but we shall

01:16:38.159 --> 01:16:49.322
discover who's responsible for this, based on the
two-day Amazon Prime shipping, which is the--

01:16:49.322 --> 01:16:51.645
(laughs)

01:16:51.645 --> 01:16:57.034
MARISHA: Oh no. Oh no. I have a feeling. I knew
it!

01:16:57.034 --> 01:16:59.706
MATT: Now I have the silver dragon, which I don't
have.

01:16:59.706 --> 01:17:01.921
MARISHA: You didn't have this one? Holy shit!

01:17:01.921 --> 01:17:04.014
MATT: It's from Attack Wing.

01:17:04.014 --> 01:17:05.913
MARISHA: Holy shit.

01:17:05.913 --> 01:17:11.945
MATT: That's awesome. Open that here in a minute.

01:17:11.945 --> 01:17:14.594
MARISHA: All the dragons. All the dragons.

01:17:14.594 --> 01:17:22.387
MATT: "Hey Matt: Don't remember you having a
silver dragon--" Which I did not! "-- so I thought

01:17:22.387 --> 01:17:24.833
I'd fix that. Merry Christmas. Stewart."
@stewartrockets on Twitter. Stewart, thank you so

01:17:24.833 --> 01:17:30.456
much. That's amazing. All of the dragons!

01:17:30.456 --> 01:17:32.926
MARISHA: That's amazing.

01:17:32.926 --> 01:17:34.971
MATT: This is from--

01:17:34.971 --> 01:17:38.484
MARISHA: Shapeways.

01:17:38.484 --> 01:17:54.543
MATT: Customs declaration. Shapeways box. Which
you know is a gamer. Let's see. There was a name

01:17:54.543 --> 01:18:00.269
on this, but it looks like it's been scratched
out? It says from Craig Waters from the United

01:18:00.269 --> 01:18:07.307
Kingdom, but maybe it's not from Craig? Maybe
we'll see a confirmation inside. Open! They're all

01:18:07.810 --> 01:18:17.921
like, "Matt, cut away from you!" I know. I like to
live dangerously. YOLO! Ugh, the fact that I said

01:18:17.921 --> 01:18:30.998
that makes me feel ill. Oh, there is a letter.
Thank God. "Dear Matt and Vox Machina and the

01:18:30.998 --> 01:18:35.230
"entire Critical Role team: First of all, thank you
for your amazing show. You all do a tremendous

01:18:35.230 --> 01:18:39.490
"job. It's hard getting up at three o'clock in the
morning to watch your show, but it's well worth

01:18:39.490 --> 01:18:42.080
"it." Thank you for waking up at three o'clock in
the morning.

01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:43.367
MARISHA: You have more drive than I do.

01:18:43.367 --> 01:18:48.018
MATT: Wonderful handwriting, by the way. Far
better than mine. "As a thank you, I'm donating to

01:18:48.483 --> 01:18:54.624
each of your preferred charities." Aw! Thank you!
"However, I did want to send a more tangible gift

01:18:54.624 --> 01:18:59.592
to Matt for inspiring me to try my luck as a
dungeon master." Hell yeah! "I recently discovered

01:18:59.592 --> 01:19:04.845
Hero Forge and tried to create myself a miniature
for each of the Vox Machina crew. They may have a

01:19:04.845 --> 01:19:10.975
cameo in the game I used to introduce my brothers
to D&D." That's awesome! People keep asking me if

01:19:10.975 --> 01:19:14.093
they can use Vox Machina in their game, or NPCs in
their game, it's like, hell yeah! Go for it!

01:19:14.093 --> 01:19:16.535
MARISHA: Immortalize us! Please!

01:19:16.535 --> 01:19:20.584
MATT: I love that. It makes me excited that
they're either our NPCs or NPCs based on them are

01:19:20.584 --> 01:19:25.256
out there. I think it's really cool. So yeah,
don't ever feel like you have to ask permission.

01:19:25.256 --> 01:19:29.785
"I recently discovered Hero Forge--"
blah-blah-blah, I already said that. "Please find

job, and if you can figure out what the books in

the good work. I look forward to laughing along

01:19:42.969 --> 01:19:48.418
"with or facepalming to many great episodes to
come. Sincerely, Craig." It was from Craig. L.M.

01:19:48.418 --> 01:19:53.712
Borne in the chatroom, and @CraigTWaters on
Twitter. Thank you so much. Let's see what this

01:19:53.712 --> 01:20:20.156
is, here. Whoa! What? (laughs) That's amazing!

01:20:20.156 --> 01:20:21.309
MARISHA: That's awesome. Is that you?

01:20:21.309 --> 01:20:22.072
MATT: That's me!

01:20:22.072 --> 01:20:24.369
MARISHA: Holy shit.

01:20:24.369 --> 01:20:26.880
MATT: Hair accurate as of two hours ago.

01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:28.266
MARISHA: Oh man.

01:20:28.266 --> 01:20:31.304
MATT: That's so cool.

01:20:31.304 --> 01:20:34.530
MARISHA: I love that you're wearing the Critical
Role t-shirt.

01:20:34.530 --> 01:20:38.892
MATT: Ah, I love it. A dragon in my hand.

01:20:38.892 --> 01:20:42.173
MARISHA: You're standing on a d20. That's
phenomenal.

01:20:42.173 --> 01:20:52.080
MATT: Yep. And I'm holding the Monster Manual and
that looks like the opening page to-- it looks

01:20:52.080 --> 01:21:04.072
like a dragon. Is it a giant on the left page? The
detail on that is fantastic. Love the smirk and

01:21:04.072 --> 01:21:10.333
the raised eyebrow. Well played. And the fact that
it's on a d20 base, too. That's so cool. Craig,

01:21:10.333 --> 01:21:14.452
that's amazing. Guys!

01:21:14.452 --> 01:21:16.146
MARISHA: Yeah, that's pretty fantastic.

01:21:16.146 --> 01:21:25.921
MATT: Guys. Oh man. That's going to live on my
desk forever. Forever. Okay.

01:21:25.921 --> 01:21:27.422
MARISHA: That's kind of great.

01:21:27.422 --> 01:21:29.750
MATT: We're getting down to the wire, here, and
then I'm going to open my minis, and then you guys

01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:31.853
can go. I know it's a long time.

01:21:31.853 --> 01:21:33.291
MARISHA: Here, you want to trade off?

01:21:33.291 --> 01:21:35.088
MATT: Yeah, actually. You open some.

01:21:35.088 --> 01:21:38.323
MARISHA: Let's see what these are.

01:21:38.323 --> 01:21:46.642
MATT: I'm surprised people are still hanging out.
That's so awesome. "Now Vox Machina can stand off

01:21:46.996 --> 01:21:48.853
"against the ultimate big bad. Matt."

01:21:48.853 --> 01:21:49.458
MARISHA: Yeah!

01:21:49.458 --> 01:21:52.116
MATT: That would be such a fast fight.

01:21:52.116 --> 01:21:54.992
MARISHA: Large base mat.

01:21:54.992 --> 01:21:56.991
MATT: Grog smashes Matt. Game over.

01:21:56.991 --> 01:22:27.094
MARISHA: (grunts with effort) Oh. Well, that failed. That did
not work. Ha-ha! Got it. Okay, this came also

01:22:27.094 --> 01:22:43.847
somewhere from the U.K. Ooh. This is from
Naomithinksit. This is from Naomithinksit.

01:22:43.847 --> 01:22:44.800
MATT: Naomithinksit!

01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:58.541
MARISHA: Walkers? She sent Walkers Marmite potato
chips.

01:22:58.541 --> 01:23:02.690
MATT: (laughing) What? That's awesome.

01:23:02.690 --> 01:23:08.721
MARISHA: This is a little package for you, it
looks like.

01:23:09.164 --> 01:23:10.250
MATT: Oh, what?

01:23:10.250 --> 01:23:18.591
MARISHA: Oh my gosh. This one's for Vax, and
here's a letter for the Critical Role cast and

01:23:18.591 --> 01:23:37.184
crew. Oh! "You are invited to partake in GISHWHES."
Oh, they're inviting us to-- that's funny. I don't

01:23:37.184 --> 01:23:53.647
know if we'd-- we'd be terrible teammates. We are
so busy. That is so fantastic. And then-- oh! Oh,

01:23:53.647 --> 01:24:00.029
these are probably the wishes. That's so funny.
Maybe-- we'll see what we can do, but we make no

01:24:00.029 --> 01:24:08.497
promises considering how insanely busy we are. But
that is still phenomenal. Thank you so much. And

01:24:08.497 --> 01:24:13.109
she sent a package for you and for Vax.

01:24:13.109 --> 01:24:15.170
MATT: And for Vax? Okay.

01:24:15.170 --> 01:24:17.071
MARISHA: Do you want to open yours real quick?

01:24:17.071 --> 01:24:20.095
MATT: Sure. Want to pass around? Switch off?

01:24:20.095 --> 01:24:21.892
MARISHA: Yeah. Switch off!

01:24:21.892 --> 01:24:29.745
MATT: Congrats on trying out dungeon mastering.
Have fun with that, man. It's such a rewarding

01:24:30.036 --> 01:24:36.976
experience. Sincerely. You're going to have fun
with it. There's a tiny little bag. I get the

01:24:36.976 --> 01:24:40.921
sincere feeling it's dice-related by its shape.

01:24:40.921 --> 01:24:44.106
MARISHA: (laughs) Or it's, like, a truffle.

01:24:44.106 --> 01:24:54.420
MATT: Or it's a dice truffle and we're both right.
Oh, whoa. That's a cool-looking die. Check that

01:24:54.420 --> 01:24:58.807
out. It's like a white and red swirl d20.

01:24:58.807 --> 01:25:00.351
MARISHA: It's so big!

01:25:00.351 --> 01:25:01.937
MARISHA: That's awesome.

01:25:01.937 --> 01:25:03.270
MATT: That's really cool.

01:25:03.270 --> 01:25:04.429
MARISHA: It rolled an 11. Not bad.

01:25:04.429 --> 01:25:04.904
MATT: Not bad.

01:25:04.904 --> 01:25:06.068
MARISHA: Nice and average.

01:25:06.068 --> 01:25:16.150
MATT: Okay. This is the letter from whom it is.
(laughs)

01:25:16.150 --> 01:25:19.941
MARISHA: Oh wow! (gasps) Shut--

01:25:19.941 --> 01:25:21.062
MATT: Yep.

01:25:21.062 --> 01:25:22.499
MARISHA: --the front door.

01:25:22.499 --> 01:25:26.498
MATT: "A glorious 50th episode." They made a
pop-up Gilmore casting magic cards.

01:25:26.498 --> 01:25:29.174
MARISHA: That's fucking amazing.

01:25:29.174 --> 01:25:32.069
MATT: How cool is that? (whooshing noise)

01:25:32.069 --> 01:25:33.843
MARISHA: That is so great.

01:25:33.843 --> 01:25:35.970
MATT: Man! Your guys' creativity is ridiculous.

01:25:35.970 --> 01:25:39.611
MARISHA: I know! I would never think of anything
like that.

01:25:39.611 --> 01:25:44.170
MATT: "Enclosed: a blood hunter d20." That's
awesome!

01:25:44.170 --> 01:25:46.544
MARISHA: Oh, that's sick.

01:25:46.544 --> 01:25:58.824
MATT: "A glorious d6." Oh man. That is, indeed,
(as Gilmore) "a glorious d6."

01:25:59.284 --> 01:25:59.994
MARISHA: Very purple.

01:25:59.994 --> 01:26:01.183
MATT: (as Gilmore) "Ha ha."

01:26:01.183 --> 01:26:04.067
MARISHA: (laughs) That's so ridiculous.

01:26:04.067 --> 01:26:04.984
MATT: What?

01:26:04.984 --> 01:26:05.888
MARISHA: (as Matt) "Ha ha!"

01:26:05.888 --> 01:26:10.523
MATT: A Critical Role music tape?

01:26:10.523 --> 01:26:11.745
MARISHA: Music tape?

01:26:11.745 --> 01:26:16.488
MATT: A musical tape. Not ready yet?

01:26:16.488 --> 01:26:23.520
MARISHA: Oh man. That is also a very long
handwritten letter, which is also crazy.

01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:31.037
MATT: From Naomi. You're amazing. Let me get this
open. Hand me the scissors.

01:26:31.037 --> 01:26:32.919
MARISHA: Uh, here they are.

01:26:32.919 --> 01:26:43.070
MATT: Scissors attack! Bam! Vox Machina has
problems with doors. I have problems with wrapping.

01:26:43.402 --> 01:26:47.705
MARISHA: (laughs) You know, we all have to have
our issues.

01:26:47.705 --> 01:26:52.530
MATT: (laughs) Critical Role: The Musical. It's a
cassette tape.

01:26:52.530 --> 01:27:00.235
MARISHA: It's a mix tape! Holy shit! Oh, boy, this
is also a gift for you, Matt. I'm just going to go

01:27:00.235 --> 01:27:01.872
ahead and hand it over.

01:27:01.872 --> 01:27:09.324
MATT: Well, hold on. I'm going to have to listen
to this. It has-- the A side says, "Songs: You're

01:27:09.324 --> 01:27:15.347
a Dagger to My Heart. Vax. I Would Like to Rage.
Grog. Baby, I'm the Shit. Scanlan. Breathing in

01:27:15.347 --> 01:27:21.486
Smoke. Percy. Hey, Boo. Keyleth and the Sun Tree.
Glorious. Gilmore. Gold, Gold, Gold. Vex.

01:27:21.486 --> 01:27:26.863
Sarenrae's Warmth. Pike. You Can Certainly Try.
DM. Make Me Something Lovely. Vex and Percy.

01:27:26.863 --> 01:27:32.306
Bonus: My Name is Tiberius Stormwind of Draconia.
Poppycock." Aww. And it has the other side. "Yes

01:27:32.306 --> 01:27:38.961
For Taking Trinket. Dirt Makes It Better. Baby,
I'm Bad News. Awful Feelings." Oh, this is so

01:27:38.961 --> 01:27:43.197
cool. I'm-- we're going to have to find-- I'm
going to put this in my car.and listen to it.

01:27:43.197 --> 01:27:49.363
"Warning: Not a real mixtape. Seriously, even if
there's a cassette player." Even better. We can

01:27:49.363 --> 01:27:52.182
make it our own mixtape. We can put songs on it.

01:27:52.182 --> 01:27:53.251
MARISHA: Oh my gosh.

01:27:53.251 --> 01:27:54.432
MATT: That's fantastic.

01:27:54.432 --> 01:27:56.811
MARISHA: That's amazing. I love the mixtape.

01:27:56.811 --> 01:28:02.897
MATT: And a letter about their D&D campaign is
included.

01:28:02.897 --> 01:28:03.516
MARISHA: Nice.

01:28:03.516 --> 01:28:12.483
MATT: That's awesome. Excited to read about that.
The wrapping is quite glorious. They did a

01:28:12.483 --> 01:28:13.314
fantastic job.

01:28:13.314 --> 01:28:18.176
MARISHA: Yeah, I love it. I might have to
repurpose, if you're not destroying all of it. I

01:28:18.176 --> 01:28:19.308
might reuse it.

01:28:19.308 --> 01:28:20.660
MATT: No, I'm destroying all of it.

01:28:20.660 --> 01:28:23.653
MARISHA: I do like recycling-- could be used--

01:28:23.653 --> 01:28:25.346
MATT: Nah. This is all being destroyed. Sorry.

01:28:25.346 --> 01:28:26.887
MARISHA: Yeah. Yeah, it is.

01:28:26.887 --> 01:28:29.183
MATT: It's wrapped in a way where it's the only
way to do it.

01:28:29.183 --> 01:28:31.140
MARISHA: It's still salvageable.

01:28:31.140 --> 01:28:32.793
MATT: What is...

01:28:32.793 --> 01:28:40.730
MARISHA: (squeaky) What'd you get? What'd you get?
What'd you get!? What is it? Oh, is that--

01:28:40.730 --> 01:28:46.028
MATT: It's an embroidered Allura. What the shit?

01:28:46.028 --> 01:28:47.978
MARISHA: You've got to be shitting me.

01:28:47.978 --> 01:28:50.065
MATT: That's amazing! Look at that!

01:28:50.065 --> 01:28:59.932
MARISHA: Hang on, let me-- oh my god. Oh my god,
you guys! The amount of detail in that!

01:28:59.932 --> 01:29:01.811
MATT: That's incredible.

01:29:01.811 --> 01:29:07.325
MARISHA: What? I've never seen anything like that
in embroidery.

01:29:07.325 --> 01:29:08.358
MATT: It's so soft, too.

01:29:08.358 --> 01:29:10.968
MARISHA: Is it? Oh my goodness, gracious.

01:29:10.968 --> 01:29:13.892
MATT: Wow. Okay. So that's also going on my wall.

01:29:13.892 --> 01:29:15.216
MARISHA: Yeah, let me see it?

01:29:15.216 --> 01:29:18.902
MATT: Look at that. Look at that. That's so cool!
Thank you, Naomi!

01:29:18.902 --> 01:29:29.161
MARISHA: That's so great. Wow. That's... That's so
great.

01:29:29.161 --> 01:29:30.364
MATT: It's stupid.

01:29:30.364 --> 01:29:33.511
MARISHA: I'm trying to think
of where we would hang that. I've got a few ideas.

01:29:33.511 --> 01:29:38.538
Okay, here, I want to-- I went to the trouble of
opening this one for you.

01:29:38.538 --> 01:29:41.493
MATT: What is this one?

01:29:41.493 --> 01:29:43.431
MARISHA: For you. To kill us.

01:29:43.431 --> 01:29:52.460
MATT: (laughs hysterically) It looks like a cloud
of Bahamuts are entering this sphere.

01:29:52.460 --> 01:29:53.828
MARISHA: Fucking cloud.

01:29:53.828 --> 01:29:57.053
MATT: That is fantastic. That's so cool!

01:29:57.053 --> 01:29:59.636
MARISHA: The day the sky went dark.

01:29:59.636 --> 01:30:03.711
MATT: Who is this from?

01:30:03.711 --> 01:30:05.714
MARISHA: I don't know. It just says a game store
on there.

01:30:05.802 --> 01:30:11.285
MATT: Well. Here's the cool thing: because I
had a Critter already give me a Bahamut, this

01:30:11.363 --> 01:30:17.104
one I will be able to gift to one of the Critters
in the audience who doesn't have it. So I can

01:30:17.104 --> 01:30:22.116
include this randomly with one of the gift
packages that gets won by chat, in the near

01:30:22.116 --> 01:30:27.794
future. So whoever sent this, you have done a
fantastic job of gifting this to another

01:30:27.794 --> 01:30:32.116
individual, who is very much in need of this for
their own campaign. Thank you so much, really

01:30:32.116 --> 01:30:34.836
appreciate that. Do let me know who it was if you
are watching this.

01:30:34.836 --> 01:30:36.006
MARISHA: Absolutely.

01:30:36.006 --> 01:30:37.144
MATT: So cool!

01:30:37.144 --> 01:30:40.465
MARISHA: Okay. This--

01:30:40.465 --> 01:30:42.625
MATT: Do you want me to turn it around for you?

01:30:42.625 --> 01:30:54.844
MARISHA: Oh man, you guys! Oh my goodness gracious.
"Dear Vox Machina and their not-so-benevolent god.

01:30:54.844 --> 01:31:12.525
"No need to read this on air." Okay, it's nothing
bad. But she said, "I just wanted to share some of

01:31:12.525 --> 01:31:24.935
"my favorite teas with you all and I figured I'd
make some personalized infusers for the group to

01:31:24.935 --> 01:31:35.745
"sip in style. Enjoy. Kelly in St. Louis." Well,
Kelly in St. Louis, amazing. She sent some Peppy

01:31:35.745 --> 01:31:43.423
Peppermint herbal tea. She sent Nettle Greek
Mountain. Ooh.

01:31:43.423 --> 01:31:48.364
MATT: Durpono said, "More tea for the so much tea
basket."

01:31:48.364 --> 01:31:52.852
MARISHA: More tea for the so much tea basket, yes.
So much tea. To be fair I have been drinking

01:31:52.852 --> 01:31:59.025
more-- I've been inspired to drink more. Which is
good. It's good for you. "This has Greek mountain

01:31:59.081 --> 01:32:05.025
"tea, nettle leaves, lemongrass, orange wedges,
lime tree blossoms, marigold blossoms, chamomile

01:32:05.025 --> 01:32:09.074
"blossoms, and other natural flavors." This one I'm
keeping.

01:32:09.074 --> 01:32:14.406
MATT: (laughter) Marisha is to tea as Matt is to
minis.

01:32:14.406 --> 01:32:24.754
MARISHA: Yes. What? She sent some-- also from
Steeped Tea-- some BLT cheese ball mix.

01:32:24.754 --> 01:32:26.379
MATT: What!?

01:32:26.379 --> 01:32:29.144
MARISHA: Some BLT cheese ball seasoning mix.

01:32:29.144 --> 01:32:30.225
MATT: What, what?

01:32:30.225 --> 01:32:37.153
MARISHA: And it has the instructions on them.

01:32:37.153 --> 01:32:42.312
MATT: The woman that sent us the fulgurite necklaces
just came into chat. Thank you so much!

01:32:42.325 --> 01:32:47.375
MARISHA: Did you send us the fulgurite necklaces?
Thank you. Those are so cool! I picked the

01:32:47.399 --> 01:32:49.892
dark brown cord because, druid.

01:32:49.892 --> 01:32:51.275
MATT: Kord's strength.

01:32:51.275 --> 01:33:04.474
MARISHA: Wow, she sent so many! Fine and Dandy.
That might have to be Scanlan. Earl Grey de la

01:33:04.510 --> 01:33:13.712
Creme. Pina colada rooibos tea, mint chocolate
chip rooibos tea, Ginger Lemon Sunshine green tea,

01:33:13.753 --> 01:33:22.916
Candy Orange. Jeez, and she even sent little
steeping sacks. And then-- hang on, let me get the

01:33:22.989 --> 01:33:35.893
rest, take those back a bit so it's not crazy. And
she sent-- awesome, you have your own steeping

01:33:35.893 --> 01:33:39.603
thing with a d20. A tea steeper with a d20 on it.

01:33:39.603 --> 01:33:43.738
MATT: What?! That's so cool! I'm using that after
this Periscope!

01:33:43.738 --> 01:33:51.204
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm thinking I might have to make some
tea. Mine has little feathers on it. She put a

01:33:51.204 --> 01:34:12.174
little feather charm. Laura's has a bear. Travis
has a battle axe on his, which is sick. Burt Reynolds has

01:34:12.174 --> 01:34:20.575
a mustache. Ash-o-lee has angel wings, Sarenrae
feathered wings.

01:34:20.575 --> 01:34:23.694
MATT: That's awesome. Person asked, "Why would a
party fight Bahamut, he is lawful good?" Yes, not

01:34:23.694 --> 01:34:28.352
all parties are necessarily good aligned, my
friend. Besides, Bahamut could also come in and aid

01:34:28.352 --> 01:34:33.074
you, depending on the situation. If your campaign
works in large gods. You never know.

01:34:33.074 --> 01:34:35.714
MARISHA: Liam's has two daggers. Taliesin's has a
gun.

01:34:35.714 --> 01:34:37.214
MATT: That's so cool.

01:34:37.214 --> 01:34:44.867
MARISHA: Oh shit. Oh my God, Kelly from St. Louis,
you spoiled us.

01:34:44.944 --> 01:34:45.946
MATT: What did Kelly do?

01:34:45.946 --> 01:34:54.835
MARISHA: She also sent us 24 honey tea sticks,
which, I just eat these straight. Like a crack

01:34:54.835 --> 01:34:57.425
addict. Oh, they got different flavored ones!

01:34:57.425 --> 01:35:01.124
MATT: Marisha Ray, rocketing to diabetes one day
at a time.

01:35:01.124 --> 01:35:06.276
MARISHA: I love honey. It's the best. This is just
the best.

01:35:06.276 --> 01:35:08.195
MATT: Have a good night! Thank you for coming!

01:35:08.195 --> 01:35:13.130
MARISHA: Have a good night, you guys! This is
amazing. Thank you so much, Kelly from St. Louis!

01:35:13.130 --> 01:35:23.112
I loved St. Louis. We loved the museum there, the
kids' museum. What's that called? What's the

01:35:23.112 --> 01:35:24.444
museum? The City Museum!

01:35:24.444 --> 01:35:26.935
MATT: Yeah, The City Museum, one of the coolest
places in the country.

01:35:26.935 --> 01:35:32.817
MARISHA: This is awesome. Thank you so much! Okay,
there's a few more boxes.

01:35:32.817 --> 01:35:41.763
MATT: Then mini-opening frenzy, then we've got to
go. Aw, thank you, Meghan! All right, Marisha,

01:35:41.763 --> 01:35:46.114
what you got? We've got those two there and the
one by your foot.

01:35:46.114 --> 01:35:53.864
MARISHA: Ooh, that one's heavy. Here. Do you want
to open that one?

01:35:53.864 --> 01:35:55.243
MATT: Sure.

01:35:55.243 --> 01:35:57.022
MARISHA: Hold it and I'll start--

01:35:57.022 --> 01:36:09.470
MATT: All right. Okay. This one is-- fuck, you
hear the airplane overhead. We live right under a

01:36:09.470 --> 01:36:21.064
flight path. The things you want to make sure you
have as a voice actor, but it makes the landscape more

01:36:21.064 --> 01:36:41.944
affordable. I'm just calling it like it is! Come
on, work with me! Priority Mail box, for this, you

01:36:41.944 --> 01:36:56.644
too shall suffer! Yes. Sweet, sweet freedom. This
is from Mark Hendrickson of Melbourne, Florida.

01:36:56.644 --> 01:37:11.056
Florida, that's my old stomping grounds growing
up. And I escaped. There are parts of Florida that

01:37:11.056 --> 01:37:15.918
are great. The part I was in was not so
great. What is this?

01:37:15.918 --> 01:37:20.204
MARISHA: Sorry.

01:37:20.204 --> 01:37:22.393
MATT: Oh, what?!

01:37:22.393 --> 01:37:24.794
MARISHA: Hi from Louisiana!

01:37:24.794 --> 01:37:31.714
MATT: What?! Oh cards, cards fell out everywhere!
Oh, Mark sent cards. "Words: to appear on stream

01:37:31.714 --> 01:37:34.498
"or not as you will. Also cards for whoever wants
one. Also ale."

01:37:34.498 --> 01:37:36.322
MARISHA and MATT: Also ale.

01:37:36.322 --> 01:37:45.265
MATT: A whole bunch of cards. Awesome. Ugh, I'm
knocking everything over. Aw, it's a little

01:37:45.265 --> 01:37:55.404
notecard! Aw! "Hey y'all. I once happened upon a
YouTube video from a small web show called Critical

01:37:55.404 --> 01:37:58.714
"Role and thought, 'This looks interesting!'
Immediately addicted, I binge watched every

01:37:58.743 --> 01:38:04.316
"episode until I was caught up on the stream. In
one of those five live sessions, I watched Ashley

01:38:04.316 --> 01:38:08.840
"have to say her goodbyes. Pike leaving was a
genuinely touching moment, the first of many. I

01:38:08.941 --> 01:38:13.875
"had an unexpectedly strong emotional impact, the
echoes of which led to this portrait of her. This

01:38:13.875 --> 01:38:17.381
"painting came unbidden, unintended. It began as a
quick sketch on a scrap piece of board that was

01:38:17.381 --> 01:38:21.172
"laying around. Over time, it grew into clarity,
and became focused. I thought you should have it."

01:38:21.172 --> 01:38:22.740
MARISHA: Holy shit.

01:38:22.740 --> 01:38:24.813
MATT: "Thank you for sharing your game and
friendship with the rest of us. You keep me

01:38:24.813 --> 01:38:27.670
"company while painting late Thursday nights. Love
you all and view you as friends, even though we've

01:38:27.670 --> 01:38:30.622
"never met. Which, now that I think about it, is
spelled 'stalker.''

01:38:30.622 --> 01:38:33.260
MARISHA: No. Lies.

01:38:33.260 --> 01:38:37.411
MATT: That's what's great about this whole
community: even though we haven't met, we're all

01:38:37.411 --> 01:38:44.305
friends. It's pretty cool. Any Critter who I've
met in person would say the same. "Here's to the

01:38:44.305 --> 01:38:49.282
"50th episode and to many more! Love, Mark
Hendrickson." Oh, these are the sketches, I think,

01:38:49.282 --> 01:38:50.493
or different ideas.

01:38:50.493 --> 01:38:53.001
MARISHA: Whoa! Mark!

01:38:53.001 --> 01:39:02.025
MATT: I haven't even seen this yet. I want to open
it and see it. What's the worst that could happen?

01:39:02.025 --> 01:39:06.631
MARISHA: We have so many bags of trash. This going
to be a cryer?

01:39:06.631 --> 01:39:08.050
MATT: I don't know, is it?

01:39:08.050 --> 01:39:12.959
MARISHA: Oh my god, yes!

01:39:12.959 --> 01:39:16.762
MATT: What the shit?! It's gold leafed and
everything!

01:39:16.762 --> 01:39:22.181
MARISHA: It's fucking gold leafed! It's an oil
painting! That's an oil painting!

01:39:22.181 --> 01:39:24.501
MATT: That's incredible!

01:39:24.501 --> 01:39:27.001
MARISHA: It looks like something you'd see at the
Louvre!

01:39:27.001 --> 01:39:29.951
[ice cream truck music]

01:39:29.951 --> 01:39:32.491
MATT: And the creepy ice cream truck in the
background!

01:39:32.491 --> 01:39:34.696
MARISHA: There it goes!

01:39:34.696 --> 01:39:36.830
MATT: That's amazing!

01:39:36.830 --> 01:39:40.030
MARISHA: Wow!

01:39:40.030 --> 01:39:45.440
MATT: Mark, that's amazing!

01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:47.830
MARISHA: That's got to go to Ashley.

01:39:47.830 --> 01:39:49.749
MATT: Oh yeah. Oh no, it has to.

01:39:49.749 --> 01:39:52.651
MARISHA: She's totally going to hang that up.

01:39:52.651 --> 01:40:00.910
MATT: She's going to flip out. She's going to
burst into tears. Look at that! Oh my god. "Pike.

01:40:00.910 --> 01:40:05.451
"Oil and gold leaf on board. Mark Hendrickson
2016." That's so incredible!

01:40:05.451 --> 01:40:13.941
MARISHA: Wow. You guys. Everyone in this community
is so fucking talented.

01:40:13.941 --> 01:40:16.910
MATT: Artists, writers, musicians.

01:40:16.910 --> 01:40:24.893
MARISHA: That's Ashley's D&D character that now
exists in an oil painting. That's insane.

01:40:24.893 --> 01:40:26.471
MATT: I can't even.

01:40:26.471 --> 01:40:27.800
MARISHA: This one's also for you, Matt.

01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:35.943
MATT: It's what? Oh my god. She's going to freak
out.

01:40:35.943 --> 01:40:38.600
MARISHA: She is going to freak out.

01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:47.316
MATT: "Matt Mercer, members of Vox Machina, and
all the Geek and Sundry crew, please find my gift

01:40:47.316 --> 01:40:51.210
"for your 50th episode enclosed. There's also a
flavor letter that Matt may or may not choose to

01:40:51.210 --> 01:40:55.341
"use. I found this show not long after the arrival
at Kraghammer and I've been an avid watcher ever

01:40:55.341 --> 01:40:59.432
"since. I believe I've completed two complete binge
watches, and I'm sure there'll be more."

01:40:59.432 --> 01:41:01.031
MARISHA: What?!

01:41:01.031 --> 01:41:04.800
MATT: "Geek and Sundry was the first channel I
subscribed to. I have to go to work, stay hooman,

yet? In Sarenrae we trust, signed Lucius

01:41:15.014 --> 01:41:27.576
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:41:27.576 --> 01:41:37.634
MATT: Tiamat. We got a Bahamut, and we got a
Tiamat. Pairing of glory.

01:41:37.634 --> 01:41:39.317
MARISHA: Oh. Shit.

01:41:39.317 --> 01:41:40.662
MATT: These guys get along, right, I think?

01:41:40.662 --> 01:41:41.622
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:41:41.622 --> 01:41:42.903
MATT: Right? I think they were old college
buddies.

01:41:42.903 --> 01:41:43.999
MARISHA: Yeah, you know.

01:41:43.999 --> 01:41:49.292
MATT: Actually, she looks a little perturbed.
That's fantastic.

01:41:49.292 --> 01:41:51.609
MARISHA: That's so funny. Okay, let me
open this box over here.

01:41:51.609 --> 01:42:00.502
MATT: Well, this is the letter we have to open.
Oh, look at that! It's all burnt. I'm such a

01:42:00.515 --> 01:42:13.712
sucker for well-weathered D&D stuff. Ahh! It's got
little sayings for everybody. It's so cool! I'm

01:42:13.712 --> 01:42:19.193
going to put that with the torch and everything,
let the group to read. Thank you so much Lucius,

01:42:19.193 --> 01:42:28.314
it's amazing. All righty. Marisha's opening-- is
this the last one, Marisha?

01:42:28.314 --> 01:42:34.232
MARISHA: Yes. There should also be bigger
envelopes as well, but I might open those when you

01:42:34.232 --> 01:42:36.062
open minis.

01:42:36.062 --> 01:42:41.719
MATT: Minis? Okay. All right, there's Marisha.

01:42:41.719 --> 01:42:47.493
MARISHA: Oh, goodness! These are whiskey toffee
brownies.

01:42:47.493 --> 01:42:49.564
MATT: What, that's a thing?!

01:42:49.564 --> 01:42:57.113
MARISHA: Made with 1971 Schenley Reserve whiskey
from Ryan Gottlieb.

01:42:57.113 --> 01:42:59.103
MATT: Oh, Ryan!

01:42:59.103 --> 01:43:01.605
MARISHA: Aka Nuclearspatula.

01:43:01.605 --> 01:43:02.832
MATT and MARISHA: Yeah!

01:43:02.832 --> 01:43:10.396
MATT: I didn't know that existed! I didn't realize
that was an option of things to have in life!

01:43:10.481 --> 01:43:21.282
MARISHA: There's the letter. And there's a little
bit of--

01:43:21.282 --> 01:43:27.425
MATT: Yeah, it's true. Booze and everything,
you're right. I should've assumed.

01:43:27.425 --> 01:43:35.663
MARISHA: This is crazy. He sent an amazing
letter.

01:43:35.663 --> 01:43:43.085
MATT: The artist who painted the Pike portrait is
Mark Hendrickson.

01:43:43.085 --> 01:43:57.511
MARISHA: This is such an amazing-- thank you so
much for this letter, Ryan. Keep your chin up and

01:43:57.511 --> 01:44:04.961
hold in there, for sure, but he said, "The
announcement for the 50th episode-- Critmas being

01:44:04.961 --> 01:44:16.362
"relegated to only the holidays," he knew he had to
send something and that he does bake. He's like,

01:44:16.362 --> 01:44:23.331
"I'm not an artist, I don't draw or paint, but I
do bake," so he made all of us a batch of homemade

01:44:23.331 --> 01:44:27.871
whiskey toffee brownies made with 45-year-old
Schenley Reserve whiskey.

01:44:27.871 --> 01:44:30.998
MATT: Wow. Thank you so much, Ryan!

01:44:30.998 --> 01:44:43.432
MARISHA: That's amazing, yep, aka Nuclearspatula.
That's-- oh. And he said, "P.S., please tell

01:44:43.432 --> 01:44:51.851
"Ryan," P.A. Ryan, "that I made sure these are free
from any poison, as I know he is allergic," So

01:44:51.939 --> 01:44:55.340
that is fantastic! He will be so greatly
appreciative.

01:44:55.340 --> 01:44:56.771
MATT: Yeah, he will.

01:44:56.771 --> 01:45:02.160
MARISHA: But look at this, look at these brownies!
Oh my god! They look so sticky!

01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:05.251
MATT: That whiskey's older than me twice?
(laughter)

01:45:05.251 --> 01:45:07.873
MARISHA: That's an excellent point!

01:45:07.873 --> 01:45:09.201
MATT: Oh wow.

01:45:09.201 --> 01:45:20.962
MARISHA: Oh my god! Okay, that's happening. All
the brownies! Let me save the letter. Save the letter!

01:45:20.962 --> 01:45:30.948
MATT: Save the cheerleader. Save the world. If
only that show was any good past the first season.

01:45:30.948 --> 01:45:34.762
Trying desperately to not have the angle of the
camera turned to just your butt.

01:45:34.762 --> 01:45:36.823
MARISHA: Sorry.

01:45:36.823 --> 01:45:45.919
MATT: It's okay. All right, those are all the
presents opened, I think. If anybody who's

01:45:45.919 --> 01:45:47.361
watching--

01:45:47.395 --> 01:45:53.970
MARISHA: I'm going to prop the camera up kind of
like I did so I can open a few letters, make sure

01:45:53.970 --> 01:45:55.460
there's no--

01:45:55.460 --> 01:46:04.880
MATT: If for whatever reason you sent a Critmas
present and it didn't get to us or we didn't open

01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:11.859
it on stream, check in with Ryan or go ahead and
write me an email. If you go to my webpage-- I

01:46:11.859 --> 01:46:16.849
guess it's having a problem if you're seeing it on
mobile, but if you look at my webpage on regular

01:46:16.849 --> 01:46:22.577
desktop, there's a submission form. Submit to me
the information about what you sent and I'll see

01:46:22.577 --> 01:46:28.873
if I can track it down. Chaos happens sometimes
and we're trying to do our best. We're also just a

01:46:28.873 --> 01:46:34.101
small group of people with a lot of things that
apparently have come in, but we'll do our best.

01:46:34.101 --> 01:46:46.241
Anyway, let's get to our mini unboxing now because
I have to prepare for our game tonight. Oh man.

01:46:46.241 --> 01:47:02.282
This is so cool. It's disturbing how much I enjoy
this whole process. So! First box unveiled! We

01:47:02.282 --> 01:47:08.764
have-- oh! What the heck? That's cool.

01:47:08.764 --> 01:47:09.857
MARISHA: What is that?

01:47:09.857 --> 01:47:11.052
MATT: It's an invisible stalker!

01:47:11.052 --> 01:47:12.166
MARISHA: Oh!

01:47:12.166 --> 01:47:19.883
MATT: That's the coolest invisible stalker model
I've seen so far, actually. We also have, it looks

01:47:19.883 --> 01:47:26.224
like, a githyanki.

01:47:26.224 --> 01:47:27.316
MARISHA: Nice.

01:47:27.316 --> 01:47:37.368
MATT: It has a cool haircut. We've got a big old
beetle, giant fire beetle. Looking all beetle-like

01:47:37.368 --> 01:47:48.196
and stuff. And we've got a bulette climbing out of
the ground and being all bulette-like. Boom. First

01:47:48.196 --> 01:47:57.064
pack done. We won't be here all night, folks.
Keeping this going at a good pace. Trying. All

01:47:57.064 --> 01:48:08.844
right, next one. (giggling) A unicorn! Aw yeah!
The day that Vox Machina faces off with an army of

01:48:08.844 --> 01:48:14.984
unicorns is going to be a great day. We've got a
dryad coming out of that pack, fantastic.

01:48:14.984 --> 01:48:20.346
(chuckling) Poor dryads. They've had a rough time
recently in our game.

01:48:20.346 --> 01:48:22.025
MARISHA: Yeah, sorry.

01:48:22.025 --> 01:48:34.283
MATT: Oh, cool, we've got a ghost. A floating
ghost with the lantern. And a wolf. Angry nature

01:48:34.283 --> 01:48:54.684
wolf. Box number two down. All right. Time for
box three. Oh, what? I'll show you that in a

01:48:54.684 --> 01:49:03.527
second. That's cool. We have an invisible female
dwarf, the sword in the air, which is cool. She

01:49:03.527 --> 01:49:15.863
ever goes invis, we got that. Oh, that one's cool,
yeah! This is a specter, I think it is? Yeah,

01:49:15.863 --> 01:49:23.295
specter, which is a creepy-looking, purplish ghost
form with arms and a head reaching out of it. The

01:49:23.295 --> 01:49:27.566
sculpts and the paint job of these minis has
improved so much even since the first set came

01:49:27.566 --> 01:49:34.435
out. It's so cool what they're doing with it now.
And a satyr! Grasping his most dangerous weapons,

01:49:34.435 --> 01:49:50.054
a scimitar and a pan flute, as a satyr should. And
a fey spider, which just looks creepy as shit, the

01:49:50.054 --> 01:49:57.065
way it's ready to jump at you. It's really cool.
Fey spiders are nasty, if you guys don't know what

01:49:57.065 --> 01:49:59.114
fey spiders do, look it up.

01:49:59.114 --> 01:50:03.873
If you guys have ever played Baldur's Gate,
you hate fey spiders. And sword spiders, those

01:50:03.896 --> 01:50:05.086
guys were bastards.

01:50:05.086 --> 01:50:07.723
MARISHA: I got this letter. I was reading this
letter and I wanted to do a quick shoutout.

01:50:07.723 --> 01:50:11.004
MATT: Do it. Do a shoutout. Come over here next to
me.

01:50:11.004 --> 01:50:21.606
MARISHA: This is from Katie Volker, aka
@TestSubjectNerd, and she said her mother, Jane

01:50:21.606 --> 01:50:30.456
Volker, is currently in the process of walking the
west coast of Ireland along the Wild Atlantic Way,

01:50:30.545 --> 01:50:36.026
a 1500-mile road trail that lines the entire west
coast. "As I'm writing this letter, she's walked

01:50:36.026 --> 01:50:43.569
"around 200 miles. If you could ask people to check
out her Facebook page and her blog, I'd be very

01:50:43.569 --> 01:50:51.465
"grateful. She's raising money for the RNLI, or the
Royal National Lifeboat Institute."

01:50:51.465 --> 01:50:53.065
MATT: Well that's cool.

01:50:53.065 --> 01:50:59.997
MARISHA: Yeah, the Royal National Lifeboat
Institution.

01:50:59.997 --> 01:51:02.487
MATT: That's really cool. Where can they find it
again on Facebook?

01:51:02.487 --> 01:51:06.685
MARISHA: On Facebook:
facebook.com/wildatlanticwanderer1.

01:51:06.685 --> 01:51:08.797
MATT: Wildatlanticwanderer1.

01:51:08.797 --> 01:51:17.269
MARISHA: Or she has a blog:
www.wildatlanticwanderer.blogspot.co.uk.

01:51:17.269 --> 01:51:18.875
MATT and MARISHA: That's really cool.

01:51:18.875 --> 01:51:23.073
MARISHA: Awesome, and thank you so much for your
kindness, TestSubjectNerd.

01:51:23.112 --> 01:51:30.663
MATT: Thank you TestSubjectNerd. I got a mummy.
And I got a dual-wielding dwarf dude with a cloak.

01:51:30.663 --> 01:51:42.253
Crossbow, I think he's a ranger? Therithar Goldrin
is his name, and he's a dwarf, which means he's

01:51:42.253 --> 01:51:49.423
awesome because dwarves are awesome. I've got a
medusa with an awesome headpiece. And a displacer

01:51:49.423 --> 01:51:54.593
beast. I love the new sculpt of the displacer
beast, by the way, they look amazing.

01:51:54.593 --> 01:51:56.272
MARISHA: What do they look like?

01:51:56.272 --> 01:52:01.031
MATT: Their pose and their musculature, it's a
great sculpt. They did a fantastic job with this

01:52:01.031 --> 01:52:20.483
set. All right, halfway done, folks. Bear with me.
All righty, we've got here-- (chuckling). Woe be

01:52:20.483 --> 01:52:27.293
those who wander in subterranean places these
days. All right, we've got a will-o'-wisp, which I

01:52:27.293 --> 01:52:39.971
love the new will-o'-wisp sculpt, it looks really
cool. Stand up straight! We've got a lich! That's

01:52:39.971 --> 01:52:46.773
a cool mini for a lich. See that, Marisha? Lich.
Check that out.

01:52:46.773 --> 01:52:49.353
MARISHA: Oh, shit, that's awesome!

01:52:49.353 --> 01:53:03.013
MATT: That's probably my favorite lich mini
they've ever done. Also got-- oh! Werewolf. Useful

01:53:03.013 --> 01:53:09.977
should any players befall a terrible fate and take
up Order of the Lycan. That's actually really

01:53:09.977 --> 01:53:25.482
cool. And gelatinous cube. I'm building an army of
these now. Must absorb every hero ever. Get in the

01:53:25.482 --> 01:53:29.692
thing! All right, three more. We're down to the
wire now, we got this.

01:53:29.692 --> 01:53:45.973
MARISHA: Nicole Young, who sent us jewelry before,
sent you, and also a gift for Liam and Taliesin,

01:53:45.973 --> 01:53:54.933
which I will deliver to them, this hand-wrapped--
her and her mom made this-- hand-wrapped dragon

01:53:54.933 --> 01:53:59.602
eye pendant that she wrapped in copper wiring.

01:53:59.602 --> 01:54:05.323
MATT: That's so cool-looking! You see this? Look
at that.

01:54:05.323 --> 01:54:10.710
MARISHA: She sent us jewelry before, and I'm sorry
I got your name confused. Sometimes cards get

01:54:10.710 --> 01:54:14.065
switched up. But thank you, that's incredible,
Nicole.

01:54:14.065 --> 01:54:15.480
MATT: That's fantastic, Nicole.

01:54:15.480 --> 01:54:17.881
MARISHA: Nicole Young from Ontario.

01:54:17.881 --> 01:54:28.971
MATT: I got a fairy dragon. It's all blue and
pretty. I got-- that female dwarf you saw earlier?

01:54:28.971 --> 01:54:37.664
Not invisible. So, both forms, which is rad. I got
this guy whose name is Hommet Shaw. I think he's a

01:54:37.664 --> 01:54:43.853
character from the Sword Coast Legends game or
something else, which, if I recall, is visually

01:54:43.853 --> 01:54:48.491
based on-- friend of Critical Role and also
awesome D&D player, I've had the opportunity

01:54:48.491 --> 01:54:54.742
playing a few episodes, Thomas Middleditch, who is
the lead of Silicon Valley and his amazing D&D

01:54:54.742 --> 01:55:02.172
character. And I got the other half of what makes
a fey spider so scary. When they phase. And that's

01:55:02.172 --> 01:55:16.181
cool, I didn't know they had both options. Two
more. I never, ever get sick of this, this is my

01:55:16.181 --> 01:55:24.279
favorite thing ever. I derive far too much joy
from this process of opening mini boxes.

01:55:24.279 --> 01:55:29.101
MARISHA: Oh, shit.

01:55:29.101 --> 01:55:42.660
MATT: That is an empty case. Oh, it's because it
fell out. Yes! Mimic! (evil chuckling)

01:55:42.660 --> 01:55:52.650
MARISHA: I just got another letter with another
wax seal and a Celtic knot.

01:55:52.650 --> 01:56:00.132
MATT: Oh snap! What is that, is that Gaelic? What
is the language right there by the side?

01:56:00.132 --> 01:56:03.971
MARISHA: I don't know, it's got a bunch of rune
symbols.

01:56:03.971 --> 01:56:05.691
MATT: Strahd zombie.

01:56:05.691 --> 01:56:13.623
MARISHA: Ugh, wax seal. It's a handwritten-- oh
no, I don't want to rip it.

01:56:13.623 --> 01:56:45.951
MATT: Angry yeti! Gah! All right, one more box.
Oh, sorry. And this-- oh, okay! I got an orc,

01:56:45.951 --> 01:57:06.733
which is awesome. We've got Ildia Naythellan, a
little player character, which is cool. I got

01:57:06.733 --> 01:57:16.430
another will-o'-wisp, so I can fill space with
them in case you guys get lost. And-- (evil laughter).

01:57:16.430 --> 01:57:21.070
I can pull it out of its case here real
fast for you. I remember seeing if this was part

01:57:21.070 --> 01:57:27.333
of the set and I really badly wanted to get one,
so I'm glad that they had one. We have a young

01:57:27.333 --> 01:57:35.442
remorhaz, which looks really cool as part of the
setup. Pretty excited about that. That's a cool

01:57:35.442 --> 01:57:42.340
final one to pull, actually. So those are my
boxes, I'm curious to see what Liam pulls. We

01:57:42.340 --> 01:57:50.110
might do a trade depending on what we get. That's
a good pull, we got some good stuff there. All

01:57:50.110 --> 01:57:53.616
right, I'm going to turn this onto Marisha now.
Marisha!

01:57:53.616 --> 01:58:00.630
MARISHA: Once again, I got another letter-- trying
to slowly go through the letters-- an amazing long

01:58:00.630 --> 01:58:10.022
handwritten letter, but he was smart and wrote a
shorter blurb version. This is from Kyle Eugene

01:58:10.022 --> 01:58:16.611
William Teach. He said, "I wanted to thank you all
for what you do. You do far more than you know--

01:58:16.611 --> 01:58:23.081
"came across Critical Role in a difficult time in
my life. I was taking a course for the Air Force

01:58:23.081 --> 01:58:29.670
"where they condensed three to four years of
instruction to a year and a half," that's insane.

01:58:29.670 --> 01:58:39.038
Late into the course, his grandfather passed, and
then a few months later, his grandmother passed,

01:58:39.038 --> 01:58:49.161
and they were very close. He said in thanks-- and
he said and then he found us. It got us through

01:58:49.161 --> 01:58:59.170
the difficult time and coins like these have a
history back to World War I. A coin like them with

01:58:59.170 --> 01:59:09.379
a squadron insignia got an Allied downed pilot
through occupied France, gaining him safe passage

01:59:09.379 --> 01:59:12.099
and aid because the French recognized it.

01:59:12.099 --> 01:59:13.710
MATT: Oh wow.

01:59:13.710 --> 01:59:20.749
MARISHA: "The only ID the previously captured
pilot held onto. And since you got me through, I

01:59:20.749 --> 01:59:22.602
"thought it was fitting."

01:59:22.602 --> 01:59:24.050
MATT: Aww.

01:59:24.050 --> 01:59:29.758
Thank you so much, Kyle.

01:59:29.758 --> 01:59:40.330
MARISHA: He sent us each-- from the United States
Air Force-- sent us each these gorgeous Presidio

01:59:40.330 --> 01:59:44.618
of Monterey challenge coins.

01:59:44.618 --> 01:59:51.200
MATT and MARISHA: That's incredible, thank you so
much, Kyle.

01:59:51.200 --> 01:59:57.869
MARISHA: These are absolutely gorgeous, and yes,
I'm slowly getting through letters. I'm sure

01:59:57.869 --> 01:59:59.591
there's more over there.

01:59:59.591 --> 02:00:02.169
MATT: Guys, thank you.

02:00:02.169 --> 02:00:06.065
MARISHA: So bear with us as we get through
things.

02:00:06.065 --> 02:00:07.827
MATT: It's all good. Yeah, it's a process.

02:00:07.827 --> 02:00:11.266
MARISHA: But thank you so much, each and every one
is so humbling and so appreciated.

02:00:11.266 --> 02:00:17.397
MATT: Seriously. There's the mini spread there for
those who wanted to see the full haul. Look at

02:00:17.397 --> 02:00:31.607
that little guy. All right, time for us to try and
get ready.

02:00:31.607 --> 02:00:35.767
MARISHA: Love you guys. I know you have Tabletop
Day and I have to get back to helping my dad.

02:00:35.767 --> 02:00:41.957
MATT: Yeah, I just saw that Geek and Sundry hit
20k! 20k donations already set up today, guys.

02:00:41.957 --> 02:00:45.945
MARISHA: Oh my goodness gracious! You guys are
insane! That's amazing.

02:00:45.945 --> 02:00:56.536
MATT: Seriously, well done guys. All right, thank
you all for joining us-- I falter in trying to

02:00:56.536 --> 02:00:58.787
express emotions, perpetually.

02:00:58.787 --> 02:00:59.987
MARISHA: Always.

02:00:59.987 --> 02:01:05.167
MATT: But you guys are amazing. You make all of
this worthwhile, and look forward to seeing how

02:01:05.167 --> 02:01:12.478
they pull themselves out of this one next week. It
should be interesting. Anyway, guys. If you're

02:01:12.478 --> 02:01:16.199
watching tonight, I'll see you at 9:30. Otherwise,
have a wonderful night. (mwah) Thanks for coming

02:01:16.199 --> 02:01:20.747
and is it Thursday yet?
