NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.932
MATT: Hello! My name is Matthew Mercer. I'm a
voice actor and the Dungeon Master for Critical

00:00:04.103 --> 00:00:09.052
Role here at Geek & Sundry, and today's episode of
GM tips revolves around some ideas on writing an

00:00:09.052 --> 00:00:14.312
all-encapsulated story for a single game session,
otherwise known as the one-shot.

00:00:14.312 --> 00:00:20.293
[intro music]

00:00:20.293 --> 00:00:24.802
MATT: I've found one-shots extremely fun and
handy, whether it be a bite-sized introduction to

00:00:24.802 --> 00:00:29.912
a new game system, or tabletop games in general
for a group of players, or as a fun break in a

00:00:29.912 --> 00:00:34.912
long-running game to allow new characters to be
tried out. Hell, letting someone else GM for once,

00:00:34.912 --> 00:00:36.554
so the usual GM can actually play.

00:00:36.554 --> 00:00:41.103
Here I will outline a basic structure for
designing your own one-shot that you can then

00:00:41.103 --> 00:00:43.973
take, alter, and customize however you see fit.

00:00:43.973 --> 00:00:48.573
I recommend first getting an idea of the kind of
characters the players wish to play. These

00:00:48.573 --> 00:00:53.302
decisions can easily inform your design, as the
intent is for everyone to have fun. Ask around, or

00:00:53.302 --> 00:00:57.894
even host a character creation meetup in advance
of the one-shot if possible. Sometimes folks might

00:00:57.894 --> 00:01:02.352
prefer to choose from pre-existing characters
you've already created, so then you can spend some

00:01:02.352 --> 00:01:06.573
time building a few pre-made characters to have
available for selection at the start of the session.

00:01:06.573 --> 00:01:11.811
Next up, what do you want to be the theme or style
of the game? If you know the players well,

00:01:11.811 --> 00:01:16.474
consider what kind of adventure they would be
into. If not, ask them what kind of adventure they

00:01:16.474 --> 00:01:20.684
all enjoy and would look forward to. Do they love
something dungeon-delve-y, with traps and

00:01:20.684 --> 00:01:26.472
monsters? Do they prefer intrigue and social
subterfuge in a tense political game? Do they love

00:01:26.472 --> 00:01:32.222
noir-like mysteries and unfolding a convoluted
plot? Do they each prefer a different style?

00:01:32.222 --> 00:01:36.752
Really, guys? Really? I-- It's okay. It's really
helping me here.

00:01:36.752 --> 00:01:42.544
Once you have a style chosen, or a good mix,
depending, think of a corresponding plot hook.

00:01:42.544 --> 00:01:47.431
This is where most one-shots can quickly fall
apart. You need a good, strong, easily-read plot

00:01:47.431 --> 00:01:51.822
hook, because this is supposed to be an
all-inclusive, full-arc story in a single session.

00:01:51.822 --> 00:01:55.394
You don't want your party wandering for half of
it, wondering what the hell they're supposed to

00:01:55.394 --> 00:02:00.772
do. Find a way to have the meat of the story grab
them early, with a strong inciting incident. For

00:02:00.772 --> 00:02:05.842
instance, as they are drinking in the tavern,
boom! The western wall explodes in a shower of

00:02:05.842 --> 00:02:11.683
splinters as a massive, insane Totatok bull begins
goring the customers with its horns. After slaying

00:02:11.683 --> 00:02:16.642
the creature, they discover a series of strange
markings on the normally docile beast. They appear

00:02:16.642 --> 00:02:23.252
deliberate, arcane, and recent. Who could have
done this, and why? Or during a celebration

00:02:23.252 --> 00:02:27.623
surrounding the maiden voyage of a major trade
ship, an assassin attempts to slay a member of the

00:02:27.623 --> 00:02:32.012
party, as well as two other officials involved
with the trade ship's company. When the chaos dies

00:02:32.012 --> 00:02:37.823
down, a ring on the assassin's hand holds the
crest of a particular noble house. And so on.

00:02:37.823 --> 00:02:43.824
Decide who or what the big bad is. You want to
design a climax to your story that is both

00:02:43.824 --> 00:02:48.532
thrilling and worth the toil in getting to it.
Design a fun villain for the adventure that fits

00:02:48.532 --> 00:02:52.063
the theme. If the climax of your story is a
monster hunt, think of an interesting and

00:02:52.063 --> 00:02:55.753
dangerous monster that could be responsible for
your inciting incident, whether directly or

00:02:55.753 --> 00:03:00.374
indirectly, and a unique battleground that will
test their capabilities. If it's a showdown with a

00:03:00.374 --> 00:03:05.282
mastermind, why did they do their dastardly deeds,
and what resources do they have at their disposal?

00:03:05.282 --> 00:03:10.457
Manpower, traps, and weaponry that would challenge
the party. If it's a race against time, what

00:03:10.457 --> 00:03:15.332
unstoppable calamity or ungodly entity is
barreling toward them, and what is the key to them

00:03:15.332 --> 00:03:17.381
stopping its arrival? Hmm?

00:03:17.381 --> 00:03:23.182
Now, time to fill in the middle. Design a handful
of key NPCs that would contain information on the

00:03:23.182 --> 00:03:27.821
story and the characters within it. List a few key
tidbits of information they would know and can

00:03:27.821 --> 00:03:32.652
offer the party, should they ask or pay
accordingly. Perhaps give them a few items they

00:03:32.652 --> 00:03:36.772
can help the party with. Know where these NPCs
might be found, but know that you can have them

00:03:36.772 --> 00:03:41.103
show up wherever you want to keep the story going.
Maybe you thought the party might meet them in a

00:03:41.103 --> 00:03:45.471
moonlight clearing, but they've circumvented it?
Have the same NPC meet them at the cave entrance,

00:03:45.471 --> 00:03:51.903
or be found wounded partway into the dungeon.
Design a few social encounters with NPCs of

00:03:51.903 --> 00:03:57.051
dubious intent. Perhaps free agents looking to use
both sides of this struggle, and allow the players

00:03:57.051 --> 00:04:02.810
a chance to make an alliance... or an enemy.
Prepare possible combat scenarios in case these

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.052
situations go south, which they always generally
do.

00:04:06.052 --> 00:04:10.512
Design some challenges that are tailored to the
player characters' abilities. Someone made a

00:04:10.512 --> 00:04:15.193
charismatic faceman? Offer some opportunities for
them to lie or persuade their way deeper into the

00:04:15.193 --> 00:04:20.352
story. Someone make a roguish spy? Throw in some
hidden traps and locked doorways to give them some

00:04:20.352 --> 00:04:26.103
much-needed utility within the party dynamic.
Someone make a brutish strongwoman? Consider a few

00:04:26.103 --> 00:04:31.302
chances for feats of strength to save the day. Try
your best to allow each player a moment or two to

00:04:31.302 --> 00:04:36.783
really shine. Also, come up with a list of
possible loot or equipment the party can discover.

00:04:36.783 --> 00:04:41.172
You can marry them to specific story beats and
locations, or tailor them on the fly, depending on

00:04:41.172 --> 00:04:46.052
what they do. You can also create key locations
where major story beats can occur to tie your

00:04:46.052 --> 00:04:50.472
inciting incident to the climax of the story. Give
yourself a couple of written sentences of

00:04:50.472 --> 00:04:54.651
description to really set the scene with each
locale, underlying their importance. If you want,

00:04:54.651 --> 00:04:59.332
you can even design a few backup, non-necessary
locales to have in your back pocket to enable

00:04:59.332 --> 00:05:05.112
easier player exploration. I would also recommend
dodging the "you are all strangers and meet in a

00:05:05.112 --> 00:05:11.263
bar" intro. It's awkward. It's time-consuming.
It's rarely fun. Talk with the players about ways

00:05:11.263 --> 00:05:15.482
they can already know each other in the story, or
they could always be a band of adventurers when

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:19.442
they start. If you must make them strangers,
consider a way to have them all drawn together

00:05:19.442 --> 00:05:24.431
definitely, and forced to become allies very
quickly. Maybe they were each summoned by a

00:05:24.431 --> 00:05:29.394
missive, by a mysterious matron, each selected for
some unknown purpose. That kind of thing.

00:05:29.394 --> 00:05:34.150
Finally-- biggest step-- keep it moving. I can't
tell you enough how many times I've written an

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.071
elaborate one-shot and found the party had only
discovered one fourth of the story beats by the

00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:42.252
middle of our allotted time to play. Try your best
to keep the story rolling when the players seem to

00:05:42.252 --> 00:05:47.161
lull or become confused. Move the appearance of an
NPC sooner than expected to help nudge the group

00:05:47.161 --> 00:05:51.041
forward, or have them discover another clue that
further points in the direction of the next story

00:05:51.041 --> 00:05:56.810
beat. Even just atmospheric tension can help keep
the story driving forward, like growing thunder

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:02.472
coming from a mysterious arcane storm. For extra
credit, prepare some fun, short epilogues for each

00:06:02.472 --> 00:06:08.983
character, describing their victorious sunset or
vicious death. Mind you, this structure works for

00:06:08.983 --> 00:06:14.280
pretty much any story in your RPG game, not just
the one-shot. You can elongate and expand on any

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.693
of these elements to flesh out an entire arc, and
please, feel free to. Go.

00:06:18.693 --> 00:06:23.343
I hope you've had a wonderful time watching. I
hope the tips on this episode have been handy to

00:06:23.343 --> 00:06:27.340
you in some way, shape, or form. Thank you so much
for watching. You can find me on Geek & Sundry's

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:32.032
Critical Role's Twitch, Thursdays at 7:00pm
Pacific time, and I'll see you on the internet.
