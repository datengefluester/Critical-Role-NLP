1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,611
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, here, where a bunch of

2
00:00:03,611 --> 00:00:06,031
us nerdy-ass voice actors play Dungeons and
Dragons.

3
00:00:06,113 --> 00:00:08,043
TRAVIS: Damn it! Damn it! It was perfect.

4
00:00:08,043 --> 00:00:14,494
MATT: No, I got it right this time. Careful what
you wish for. But yeah, so thank you for joining

5
00:00:14,494 --> 00:00:23,465
us! Last week was kind of a crazy episode, and
this week we continue that theme. However, I do

6
00:00:23,465 --> 00:00:27,790
want to go over some quick announcements, so we
can get the show on the road, get as much game

7
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:31,695
time as possible. Looks like we are going to be
down one Scanlan Shorthalt tonight. Unfortunately,

8
00:00:31,695 --> 00:00:37,342
Sam Riegel had scheduling stuff he couldn't get
around, but we do have our other fantastic gnome,

9
00:00:37,342 --> 00:00:39,068
Ashley Johnson, joining us from New York.

10
00:00:39,068 --> 00:00:40,608
(cheering)

11
00:00:40,608 --> 00:00:42,445
TRAVIS: Ashley Johnson. Pike is amazing.

12
00:00:42,445 --> 00:00:51,266
MATT: So yeah, that's cool. This is our 40th
episode. 40th episode. That's crazy to me.

13
00:00:51,266 --> 00:00:57,243
MARISHA: Which we could have waited and celebrated
50th episode, but fuck it. 40 it is.

14
00:00:57,243 --> 00:01:00,604
LAURA: Well, we'll celebrate 50th like a
motha.

15
00:01:00,604 --> 00:01:02,965
LIAM: We told ourselves 40 and done.

16
00:01:02,965 --> 00:01:07,222
LAURA: So this is the last episode, you guys. Hope
you've had fun.

17
00:01:07,222 --> 00:01:14,589
MATT: Hopefully not. I certainly hope not. We'll
see how tonight goes. So yeah, that'll be cool

18
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:21,121
and we're gonna have our anniversary coming up in March
too, which will be fun, so excited for that. Yeah,

19
00:01:21,121 --> 00:01:21,909
so--

20
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:25,582
LAURA: Oh my gosh, will our 50th time up with our
year? We got to figure this math out.

21
00:01:25,582 --> 00:01:27,890
TALIESIN: Four episodes in February.

22
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:32,928
MATT: Close, we'll see. That would be crazy.

23
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:37,099
TALIESIN: No. No, it won't, but close.

24
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:43,210
MATT: No, I don't think so, but anyway, couple of
quick announcements, just a reminder we're going

25
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:48,843
to be at Wizard World Portland, February
20th-21st, so if you guys are in the area and want

26
00:01:48,843 --> 00:01:50,963
to come say hello, we'll be there for those two
days.

27
00:01:50,963 --> 00:01:52,214
TRAVIS: Come out and say hi!

28
00:01:52,214 --> 00:01:55,630
MATT: Yes, do it. We'll be doing signings. We'll
have panels Saturday and Sunday, so it should be a

29
00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:03,937
fun time and hopefully we'll see you there. Me and
Marisha will be in Denver for Colorado Anime Fest

30
00:02:03,937 --> 00:02:09,227
the weekend before that, for Valentine's day
weekend in Denver, Colorado. So if you guys are in

31
00:02:09,227 --> 00:02:14,512
that area, you can come and visit us, also for fun
panels and insanity that shall ensue. So look

32
00:02:14,512 --> 00:02:20,517
forward to that. Also, me and Marisha will be in
Ireland, we can now announce, at the beginning of

33
00:02:20,517 --> 00:02:27,023
March. For Kaizoku Con. In Ireland so--

34
00:02:27,023 --> 00:02:29,294
LIAM: That's as Irish as it can gets.

35
00:02:29,294 --> 00:02:32,278
MATT: Yeah, Kaizoku? I know, isn't it? It's an old
Gaelic term.

36
00:02:32,278 --> 00:02:34,353
(laughter)

37
00:02:34,353 --> 00:02:40,339
MATT: But we've never been. We're excited to come out
and see that side of the UK and that part of

38
00:02:40,339 --> 00:02:44,150
Europe real fast. It's going to be really cool. So
we look forward to seeing you guys out there

39
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,217
hopefully.

40
00:02:45,217 --> 00:02:49,779
TALIESIN: I've got one, too. I've got one too. I'm
going to be, the weekend before that as well, the

41
00:02:49,779 --> 00:02:56,936
Valentine's Day weekend, at Amazing Arizona Comic
Con. Amazing Arizona Comic Con. It's going to be

42
00:02:56,936 --> 00:03:00,104
amazing. In Arizona. With comics.

43
00:03:00,104 --> 00:03:03,126
MARISHA: Are you going to be raising Arizona?

44
00:03:03,126 --> 00:03:07,561
TALIESIN: Wow. You're fired. You're razing Arizona
with fire.

45
00:03:07,561 --> 00:03:10,240
TRAVIS: Get those out of the way now.

46
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,748
MATT: 2d6 damage.

47
00:03:11,748 --> 00:03:13,343
(laughter)

48
00:03:13,343 --> 00:03:21,703
MATT: Anybody else have any other events coming up
they want to mention, if anything, anyone? No? If

49
00:03:21,703 --> 00:03:27,451
one pops up, you're welcome to jump in. Let's see,
we also have a few projects that recently came

50
00:03:27,451 --> 00:03:31,059
out. Liam, since you are partly at helm of both of
these projects.

51
00:03:31,059 --> 00:03:37,181
LIAM: Oh, I voice directed on two games. They're
the exact same game, basically. One is called 'The

52
00:03:37,181 --> 00:03:43,102
Witness.' Mastermind Jonathan Blow has created a
very, very unique game. There's no shooting people

53
00:03:43,102 --> 00:03:48,554
in the face or any of that, but it looks to be one
of the best gaming experiences of the year.

54
00:03:48,554 --> 00:03:50,201
TRAVIS: It's getting amazing reviews.

55
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:56,908
LIAM: And then I also directed the voices for--
And Ashley Johnson is in The Witness. And I also

56
00:03:56,908 --> 00:04:03,923
got to direct most of the voiceover for, what's
it called? Lego Marvel Avengers, which

57
00:04:03,923 --> 00:04:04,915
everybody--

58
00:04:04,915 --> 00:04:07,358
LAURA: Oh, what's the name of that? Oh yeah, Lego
Marvel Avengers.

59
00:04:07,358 --> 00:04:15,218
LIAM: You've heard of it. Show of hands, who's
doing a voice in the game? Aww. Well, next one.

60
00:04:15,218 --> 00:04:20,259
TALIESIN: That's okay. I'm down to play it. I
don't want anything spoiled, and casting for Ms.

61
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:21,915
Marvel.

62
00:04:21,915 --> 00:04:27,089
LIAM: She was the first and last person I thought
of.

63
00:04:27,089 --> 00:04:29,292
ASHLEY: Wait! Who did they cast as Ms. Marvel?

64
00:04:29,292 --> 00:04:30,739
MATT: Ashly Burch.

65
00:04:30,739 --> 00:04:33,056
ASHLEY: (gasps) Really?

66
00:04:33,056 --> 00:04:35,490
MATT: Yeah. First canonical voice for the new Ms.
Marvel.

67
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:36,824
TALIESIN: Isn't that hardcore?

68
00:04:36,824 --> 00:04:42,217
LIAM: Also unique fun fact: Ashley is playing the
character she played in the Avengers movie, so her

69
00:04:42,217 --> 00:04:44,049
Lego figure looks like her.

70
00:04:44,049 --> 00:04:47,668
LAURA: What? That's amazing.

71
00:04:47,668 --> 00:04:49,121
ASHLEY: Forgot about that.

72
00:04:49,121 --> 00:04:51,737
(laughter)

73
00:04:51,737 --> 00:04:58,815
ASHLEY: We did it a little bit ago and I think I
completely forgot. Very excited.

74
00:04:58,815 --> 00:05:00,688
(laughter)

75
00:05:00,688 --> 00:05:07,854
MATT: You know you've made it when. Well, cool. So
congrats! Yeah, go play them, guys. Let's see.

76
00:05:07,854 --> 00:05:12,941
Also, a reminder for Wyrmwood Gaming, who makes
awesome wooden game stuff. They're still

77
00:05:12,941 --> 00:05:17,893
supporting our special code to get free shipping
when you order from them.

78
00:05:17,893 --> 00:05:22,447
LIAM: That code is 'critrole'. Critrole. You get
free shipping if you type in 'critrole', but you

79
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,189
got to do it on their website, not other websites.

80
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:29,855
MATT: Yeah, doesn't work well if you go to like
Bed, Bath and Beyond. We don't have a relationship

81
00:05:29,855 --> 00:05:31,342
with them. Yet.

82
00:05:31,342 --> 00:05:35,764
TALIESIN: We should register at very least, at
this point.

83
00:05:35,764 --> 00:05:38,923
MATT: We're working on it. We're working on it. We
think there is a lot of great crossover, like the

84
00:05:38,923 --> 00:05:44,163
Venn diagram between Bed, Bath and Beyond enthuasiasts
and Critters. So, do we have any other

85
00:05:44,163 --> 00:05:46,168
announcements anyone wants to make or shall we
dive on in?

86
00:05:46,168 --> 00:05:52,812
MARISHA: We haven't plugged them in a while. Our
wonderful charity that we support: 826LA. Go check

87
00:05:52,812 --> 00:06:00,474
them out. There's still a huge portion of our
proceeds that go to 826LA every week and-- Well,

88
00:06:00,474 --> 00:06:07,682
they tutor children through the ages of
kindergarten and 18, because kindergarten is an

89
00:06:07,682 --> 00:06:16,105
age, and help in creative writing and
storytelling, and they also have cool store fronts

90
00:06:16,105 --> 00:06:19,728
all the way across the country. There's one in
like San Fran. I know there's one in New York.

91
00:06:19,728 --> 00:06:21,730
TALIESIN: There's a pirate store. There's a
superhero store.

92
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:24,181
MARISHA: I think there's one in Seattle.

93
00:06:24,181 --> 00:06:27,631
TRAVIS: Plus you are handing out D&amp;D to young
kids, getting them started and hooked at a young

94
00:06:27,631 --> 00:06:28,466
age.

95
00:06:28,466 --> 00:06:33,085
MARISHA: Yes. Yeah, if you have an 826 in your
area, you should go there and tutor, and you

96
00:06:33,085 --> 00:06:34,962
should be like 'Hey.'

97
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:36,301
LAURA: You should go to there.

98
00:06:36,301 --> 00:06:39,411
MARISHA: You should go to there and you should
tutor to there and you should introduce D&amp;D to

99
00:06:39,411 --> 00:06:40,243
them.

100
00:06:40,243 --> 00:06:42,516
TALIESIN: Run a D&amp;D game for kids.

101
00:06:42,516 --> 00:06:44,417
MARISHA: Run a D&amp;D game for kids. It's very
fulfilling.

102
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:46,421
MATT: That's cool.

103
00:06:46,421 --> 00:06:48,315
ASHLEY: Oh, I want to give a shoutout.

104
00:06:48,315 --> 00:06:49,546
MATT: Yeah, Ashley, go for it.

105
00:06:49,546 --> 00:06:53,855
ASHLEY: There's this place that pretty close to
where I live called The Brooklyn Strategist.

106
00:06:53,855 --> 00:07:03,800
Yeah, and when Laura and Travis came to visit--
It's basically a gaming shop and you can play D&amp;D

107
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:11,930
there on Wednesday nights and Saturdays. And play
board games. It's also a coffee shop. It's rad.

108
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,491
LIAM: Brooklyn?

109
00:07:13,491 --> 00:07:16,142
TRAVIS: They got like cookies and a little coffee
thing.

110
00:07:16,142 --> 00:07:19,081
LAURA: I bought a Millennium Falcon cookie when I
was there.

111
00:07:19,081 --> 00:07:20,944
TRAVIS: It was pretty dope.

112
00:07:20,944 --> 00:07:22,253
ASHLEY: It was delicious.

113
00:07:22,253 --> 00:07:23,661
MARISHA: What was it called again, Ashley?

114
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:28,936
ASHLEY: The Brooklyn Strategist. Check it out if
you're in New York or Brooklyn.

115
00:07:28,936 --> 00:07:32,915
MATT: There you go. Do it.

116
00:07:32,915 --> 00:07:35,713
TRAVIS: What else can we do to put off dying by
four ancient dragons?

117
00:07:35,713 --> 00:07:36,935
LAURA: I know.

118
00:07:36,935 --> 00:07:38,843
LIAM: What else can we talk about for the next
four hours?

119
00:07:38,843 --> 00:07:40,144
TALIESIN: Look at all that--

120
00:07:40,144 --> 00:07:44,690
MATT: Nothing. We're going to jump right into it.
All right, guys, so welcome to tonight's episode

121
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:52,285
of Critical Role. So to get you up to speed real
fast: the group Vox Machina, after finishing their

122
00:07:52,285 --> 00:07:57,608
foray in Whitestone, finding a member of the
council, Riskel Daxio, was a cult member for this

123
00:07:57,608 --> 00:08:03,053
entity called Vecna, bringing him to justice and
executing him in the throne room of the palace of

124
00:08:03,053 --> 00:08:11,411
Emon, they discovered during the search the
traveling troupe of Dr. Dranzel's performance

125
00:08:11,411 --> 00:08:18,811
troupe, which Scanlan used to be a part of. During
this time, they hatched a plan to have Vox Machina

126
00:08:18,811 --> 00:08:22,909
seek this house that had fallen into disarray, and
the owner disappeared for a while, that may

127
00:08:22,909 --> 00:08:26,855
contain some goods. The party went and
investigated. They had previously been in the

128
00:08:26,855 --> 00:08:31,885
house and were curious as to where it stands at
this point in time, especially if more people are

129
00:08:31,885 --> 00:08:37,522
disappearing into it. Upon going into what was
once General Krieg's house where they once fought

130
00:08:37,522 --> 00:08:43,026
a blue dragon, they discovered the corpse of
Krieg, long-buried from the collapse of the cavern

131
00:08:43,026 --> 00:08:48,495
and picked apart by some other large clawed
creature. And immediately got into some sort of

132
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:54,781
a fight with a purple worm and a frost worm that were
essentially battling over whatever it was that was

133
00:08:54,781 --> 00:09:01,419
moving in that tunnel that seemed to be nice and
tasty. These adolescent worm creatures, not even

134
00:09:01,419 --> 00:09:05,878
fully grown, proved a nice little challenge, but
the party managed to succeed in escaping after

135
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:12,243
killing them, before the mother showed up. They
returned to Emon, managed to help Scanlan's

136
00:09:12,243 --> 00:09:17,220
now-discovered daughter, Kaylie, out of a little
pinch in getting imprisoned after she'd gotten

137
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:22,608
into a major bar brawl. And the party returned to
their keep, where they were notified that Uriel,

138
00:09:22,608 --> 00:09:28,496
the Sovereign of Tal'Dorei and the city state of
Emon, had an announcement to make in the Cloudtop

139
00:09:28,496 --> 00:09:33,424
District. So gathered Gilmore, gathered the rest
of the party, and everyone went to the Cloudtop

140
00:09:33,424 --> 00:09:44,310
District around noon at the presentational stage--
not at noon, at dusk. Sorry, the other one. So, at

141
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:54,524
which point Uriel announced that he felt he was no
longer a worthy leader or ruler of this entire

142
00:09:54,524 --> 00:10:03,794
realm he has under his watch and is deciding to step
down. During this announcement, however, a number

143
00:10:03,794 --> 00:10:09,030
of strange entities came through the clouds in the
sky as a series of chromatic ancient dragons

144
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:17,284
swooped in and began to destroy the city of Emon.
Many of the townsfolk gathered at that square were

145
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:23,601
immediately killed. The party as well as a few
straggling survivors ran away as both the large,

146
00:10:23,601 --> 00:10:30,788
gargantuan black and green dragon begin to chase
you down. Right before they honed in to pick you

147
00:10:30,788 --> 00:10:39,047
off, an even larger ancient red dragon shoved
them off to head east to continue their plot after

148
00:10:39,047 --> 00:10:45,998
slamming down into the center of Emon and claiming
it as his own domain. The party escaped via the

149
00:10:45,998 --> 00:10:52,766
druid's Transport Via Plants spell and just
stepped through the tree to land in the center of

150
00:10:52,766 --> 00:10:58,891
their keep of Greyskull. So now we pick up where
that left off.

151
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:06,683
So as you all come rushing through the other side
of the transport spell, each one of you comes

152
00:11:06,683 --> 00:11:10,506
stumbling out into the center of the temple to
Sarenrae that's constructed on the base floor of

153
00:11:10,506 --> 00:11:17,594
your keep. The sheer intensity and force that
pushes you all through one after another, some of

154
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:21,205
you end up tripping and catching yourself, but
nevertheless you all make it through safe and

155
00:11:21,205 --> 00:11:27,164
sound before the large tree trunk behind you, the
portal, snaps shut, the magic exhausted. The

156
00:11:27,164 --> 00:11:33,274
adrenaline still pumping in your head, you're all
still thinking over and processing what exactly

157
00:11:33,274 --> 00:11:36,748
had just happened and what it means.

158
00:11:36,748 --> 00:11:38,557
TRAVIS: Are we all here?

159
00:11:38,557 --> 00:11:41,135
MARISHA: All those people.

160
00:11:41,135 --> 00:11:42,704
TALIESIN: Yes? Yes?

161
00:11:42,704 --> 00:11:46,135
TRAVIS: Is anyone hurt?

162
00:11:46,135 --> 00:11:48,818
TALIESIN: That's a good question.

163
00:11:48,818 --> 00:11:52,164
MARISHA: Can we see anything from here?

164
00:11:52,164 --> 00:11:57,628
MATT: Looking around right now, you have the
stained glass of the complex. The keep seems to be

165
00:11:57,628 --> 00:12:02,732
in order. From this perspective, you don't see
anything because the city is on the opposite side

166
00:12:02,732 --> 00:12:06,553
of the keep. This portion of the temple is
actually facing southward.

167
00:12:06,553 --> 00:12:13,712
TALIESIN: I suppose I'd like to get a vantage
point, to see what we can see. Is there any way

168
00:12:13,712 --> 00:12:17,813
to-- I think we all took damage. I think
we're all hurt.

169
00:12:17,813 --> 00:12:21,371
TRAVIS: We're all hurt a little bit.

170
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:22,589
LIAM: Pike, heal?

171
00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:25,349
ASHLEY: Yeah, let me do some healing.

172
00:12:25,349 --> 00:12:27,610
MATT: Pike, be aware, as part--

173
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,309
ASHLEY: I don't know where I'm at.

174
00:12:29,309 --> 00:12:37,660
MATT: Yeah, I'll let you know where you are at.
You cast, let's see, you cast Heal once, which I

175
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:44,099
believe was your 6th-level spell, and then you
cast Mass Cure Wounds, so a 5th-level spell. So

176
00:12:44,099 --> 00:12:48,475
you've cast a 6th and a 5th.

177
00:12:48,475 --> 00:12:51,103
ASHLEY: One 6th and one 5th?

178
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,362
MATT: Correct.

179
00:12:52,362 --> 00:12:58,995
ASHLEY: Okay. All right, and then healthwise,
where am I at? Went down 66?

180
00:12:58,995 --> 00:13:04,918
MATT: Healthwise, you were down 66 and then you
healed up, I don't remember the exact number. It

181
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:07,141
was like 24. We'll go with 24. It's fine.

182
00:13:07,141 --> 00:13:26,944
ASHLEY: Okay guys, let's do a Mass Cure Wounds
then at fourth level.

183
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:31,501
MATT: Okay. Which one is this? Are you casting
Cure Wounds?

184
00:13:31,501 --> 00:13:33,432
ASHLEY: Yeah.

185
00:13:33,432 --> 00:13:34,708
MATT: On who?

186
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:36,939
ASHLEY: A Mass Cure Wounds, sorry.

187
00:13:36,939 --> 00:13:39,044
MATT: Mass Cure Wounds is a 5th-level spell.

188
00:13:39,044 --> 00:13:41,819
ASHLEY: How low is everybody?

189
00:13:41,819 --> 00:13:43,478
TRAVIS: I'm all right.

190
00:13:43,478 --> 00:13:44,673
LIAM: I'm all right.

191
00:13:44,673 --> 00:13:47,486
LAURA: 43, but if we can take a short rest, we can
roll some dice.

192
00:13:47,486 --> 00:13:50,281
MARISHA: I'm at 32, so same thing.

193
00:13:50,281 --> 00:13:52,147
TALIESIN: 57.

194
00:13:52,147 --> 00:13:53,611
TRAVIS: Short rest?

195
00:13:53,611 --> 00:13:55,212
ASHLEY: Short rest.

196
00:13:55,212 --> 00:13:57,326
MARISHA: We should get inside, anyways.

197
00:13:57,326 --> 00:14:00,028
TALIESIN: Let's get inside. I want to see if I can
get a vantage from the top.

198
00:14:00,028 --> 00:14:05,042
LIAM: I think in the short term, we need to take
care of two things: one, get a vantage point and

199
00:14:05,042 --> 00:14:09,977
see how the keep is and what we can see from
above. We also need to get the staff out of here,

200
00:14:09,977 --> 00:14:12,386
we need to send them away immediately.

201
00:14:12,386 --> 00:14:17,235
TALIESIN: Do we send them away or do we send them
down below? Like for shelter?

202
00:14:17,235 --> 00:14:18,900
LAURA: We don't need them running out.

203
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,489
TALIESIN: It's safer than running around outside,
that's where I want to end up.

204
00:14:21,489 --> 00:14:24,001
LAURA: Send them below.

205
00:14:24,001 --> 00:14:26,822
LIAM: Out of the city, though, into the wild?

206
00:14:26,822 --> 00:14:31,097
LAURA: If we need to, we can bring them through
the portal into Whitestone.

207
00:14:31,097 --> 00:14:33,936
MARISHA: We don't know what all is safe right
now.

208
00:14:33,936 --> 00:14:41,412
LIAM: I'm all right, so I'm going to go find the
staff and herd them down below and tell them what

209
00:14:41,412 --> 00:14:42,816
has happened.

210
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:45,417
TALIESIN: You can put them in my workshop.
Actually--

211
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,060
MARISHA: Why don't we all head down there?

212
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:50,068
TALIESIN: Yes, let's head down to my workshop
because I have to unlock it anyway.

213
00:14:50,116 --> 00:14:54,372
MATT: Pike, are you not casting Cure Mass Wounds?
You have one more 5th-level spell, so you could do

214
00:14:54,372 --> 00:14:55,531
if you wanted.

215
00:14:55,531 --> 00:14:56,902
ASHLEY: Yeah, let me go ahead and do it.

216
00:14:56,902 --> 00:15:02,336
MATT: Okay. So I believe that's 3d8 plus five,
unless I'm mistaken.

217
00:15:02,336 --> 00:15:03,784
LIAM: This one's on everyone?

218
00:15:03,784 --> 00:15:13,808
MATT: This was on, this would be on up to six
creatures, so 3d8+5. Well, everybody but one.

219
00:15:13,808 --> 00:15:15,447
LAURA: Everybody but Scanlan.

220
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:17,810
MATT: Sure, everybody but Scanlan, we'll put it
there.

221
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:19,058
ASHLEY: 18.

222
00:15:19,058 --> 00:15:20,790
MATT: Plus five?

223
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,993
ASHLEY: That's plus five.

224
00:15:22,993 --> 00:15:24,713
MATT: Okay, so everyone heals 18 hit points.

225
00:15:24,713 --> 00:15:27,759
ASHLEY: Rolled a little low.

226
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:32,044
MATT: That's all right. Okay, you're heading
off--

227
00:15:32,044 --> 00:15:36,464
LIAM: I'm going to start moving through the entire
place, I'm going to start at the front gate and

228
00:15:36,464 --> 00:15:38,429
see if anybody's outside.

229
00:15:38,431 --> 00:15:42,525
MATT: As you head into the foyer, the first thing
you see is Laina currently panicking about,

230
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:47,039
running around with Erwin falling behind, trying
to calm her down and going, "Laina, it's all right

231
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:51,608
"calm down." And Laina is like, "I don't know what
to do, I, I--" She turns around and sees you, "Oh,

232
00:15:51,608 --> 00:15:54,392
"Master, Master Vax."

233
00:15:54,392 --> 00:15:59,748
LIAM: It's actually not all right, we need to
gather everyone right now, quickly, I'll explain

234
00:15:59,748 --> 00:16:06,379
after we've gotten everyone in the keep. We need
to go to Percival's workshop, can you help me with

235
00:16:06,379 --> 00:16:07,204
that?

236
00:16:07,204 --> 00:16:12,613
MATT: "We can do that, we have a problem--" She
points out. The front of the keep is currently

237
00:16:12,613 --> 00:16:17,488
opened, the doors and the gate's there and you
can hear what sounds like a cluster of very loud

238
00:16:17,488 --> 00:16:21,430
voices, shouting and screaming and yelling over
each other.

239
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,663
TRAVIS: Outside of the keep?

240
00:16:22,663 --> 00:16:24,567
LIAM: But I'm on my own, right?

241
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:25,624
MATT: You are, yeah.

242
00:16:25,624 --> 00:16:27,656
MARISHA: What are the voices speaking?

243
00:16:27,656 --> 00:16:30,619
MATT: Are you following him to the foyer?
Currently only Vax is.

244
00:16:30,619 --> 00:16:32,891
LIAM: Go to Percival's workshop, go, I will handle
it.

245
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:34,753
MARISHA: I figured we'd all be moving outside, at
least.

246
00:16:34,753 --> 00:16:39,145
MATT: All right, as you guys move into the foyer
to follow, you see Vax having this conversation

247
00:16:39,145 --> 00:16:46,009
with Laina. She and Erwin go head back down, to
head down to the workshop. What are you doing?

248
00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:50,376
LIAM: I'm going to go stealth toward the door to
see what the hell is going on out there.

249
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:54,136
MATT: Okay. Roll stealth check.

250
00:16:54,136 --> 00:16:59,181
LIAM: Yeah, it's a 29.

251
00:16:59,181 --> 00:17:04,800
MATT: All right, good to know. All right, so as
you go to the door and look out, you can see,

252
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:10,832
along the top wall there are three figures. Takes
you a moment to focus, and you realize that it is

253
00:17:10,832 --> 00:17:16,686
Kendrick, who's one of your general guards you
keep around, as well as Cordell and Shayne. All

254
00:17:16,686 --> 00:17:20,012
three of them have crossbows ready, and they're
yelling to each other and aiming them over the

255
00:17:20,012 --> 00:17:27,122
wall towards the front. However, what you can hear
from this point is a chorus of 20, 30 or more

256
00:17:27,122 --> 00:17:29,589
voices muffled from the other side of the wall.

257
00:17:29,589 --> 00:17:37,432
LIAM: I'm going to start running up towards them.
I'm going to join them on the wall.

258
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:41,781
MATT: Okay, so there is a ladder at the side, and
you climb up the ladder, and as you get closer,

259
00:17:41,781 --> 00:17:46,352
you hear people shouting, different voices going,
"Let us in, let us in or we'll die!" Voices going,

260
00:17:46,352 --> 00:17:49,740
"What are you doing, you going to leave us out
here?!" Other people are screaming, you hear

261
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,288
crying children, you hear people shrieking.

262
00:17:52,288 --> 00:17:53,842
LIAM: How many people am I seeing down there?

263
00:17:53,842 --> 00:17:58,050
MATT: Well, as you get up to the top and crest
over, you can see the three guards are all yelling

264
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:01,564
at each other and yelling over, "We can't, we
can't do anything right now, we're waiting for

265
00:18:01,608 --> 00:18:05,271
"th--" They look over and see you come over
the edge, and you can see there's probably close

266
00:18:05,271 --> 00:18:10,367
to 50 or so people that are all pressed up against
the gates to the inside of your keep, that are all

267
00:18:10,367 --> 00:18:11,817
shouting to be let in.

268
00:18:11,817 --> 00:18:16,360
LIAM: If I look past, do I see anyone else coming
towards the keep? Is it just a cluster and that's

269
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,292
it, or--

270
00:18:17,292 --> 00:18:22,098
MATT: You can see people that are fleeing from the
town in little bits, two or three at a time,

271
00:18:22,098 --> 00:18:27,824
trails of individuals that are just now managing
to make it outside of the city of Emon itself.

272
00:18:27,824 --> 00:18:32,321
Some of them are heading out into the distance,
getting far away as possible. A few more are

273
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:37,024
heading towards the keep, and you gather that this
crowd has been gathering here for the last few

274
00:18:37,024 --> 00:18:38,241
minutes, at the very least.

275
00:18:38,241 --> 00:18:42,488
LIAM: All right, slapping my hand on Kendrick's
shoulder. We are going to let these people in. The

276
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:51,401
city has come under attack, everything is fucked
beyond belief. There are at least four large, old

277
00:18:51,401 --> 00:18:55,125
dragons attacking the city, and these people need
to come inside. I don't know what we're going to

278
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:58,603
do with them, but we're going to bring them in
now. And you and I are going to wait by the gate

279
00:18:58,603 --> 00:19:03,324
for those stragglers to come in. The rest of you,
take them inside, join the others.

280
00:19:03,324 --> 00:19:09,418
MATT: They all look at each other. Cordell gives
you a nod, "Right, sir, we'll open the gate, hold

281
00:19:09,418 --> 00:19:13,055
"on." And you guys all, are you heading out to the
courtyard as well? Or are you staying inside the

282
00:19:13,055 --> 00:19:13,763
keep?

283
00:19:13,763 --> 00:19:14,961
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, we see them.

284
00:19:14,961 --> 00:19:17,640
MATT: So you come out and see this happening
and hear them shouting at the top of the wall.

285
00:19:17,675 --> 00:19:22,473
MARISHA: Keyleth stands in the middle of the
foyer, unable to move.

286
00:19:22,473 --> 00:19:26,764
TALIESIN: Keep them out of my workshop, but put
them into the spare rooms and anywhere we have

287
00:19:26,764 --> 00:19:27,478
room.

288
00:19:27,478 --> 00:19:28,467
LAURA: Maybe the cathedral?

289
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:29,470
TALIESIN: The cathedral is a great idea.

290
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:33,437
MATT: At this point, you hear this strange
high-pitched whine sound. Vax, as you look up, you

291
00:19:33,437 --> 00:19:37,630
can see there are these columns of smoke that are
billowing out of the city in the distance as mass

292
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:44,343
areas are burning and smoldering. You see coming
out of one of the clouds something spinning slowly

293
00:19:44,343 --> 00:19:49,672
towards you, and you look up and see it's one of
the skyships from the Cloudtop District, one half

294
00:19:49,672 --> 00:19:51,273
of it currently in flames.

295
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,673
LAURA: Inside, now!

296
00:19:54,673 --> 00:19:56,992
LIAM: I scream out, get the gates open now!

297
00:19:56,992 --> 00:20:00,517
MATT: At which point, you can see now Shayne and
Cordell are pulling on the ratchets, pulling the

298
00:20:00,517 --> 00:20:03,965
chains up as fast as they can while putting their
eyes up and seeing this as it careens in your

299
00:20:03,965 --> 00:20:04,882
direction.

300
00:20:04,882 --> 00:20:06,746
TALIESIN: I'm running up to the tower as quickly
as I can.

301
00:20:06,746 --> 00:20:12,297
LIAM: And I'm fireman's pole down the ladder, down
one side of the ladder to get to the gate.

302
00:20:12,297 --> 00:20:17,430
MATT: Okay. The gate opens a little bit, enough to
get one or two people through, and begins to push

303
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:22,088
through, and you can see now people are yelling in
pain as they're being crushed, as the whole mass

304
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:23,823
of them are pushing through the small opening.

305
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:25,876
LIAM: I scream out: if you rush, you will die!

306
00:20:25,876 --> 00:20:29,940
MATT: It doesn't seem to be affecting anybody,
unfortunately. There's this inlaid fear, this

307
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,675
animalistic need to survive.

308
00:20:31,675 --> 00:20:34,519
LAURA: I start to grab people arms and pulling
them through and helping people get through

309
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:35,364
safely.

310
00:20:35,364 --> 00:20:40,436
MATT: At this point, the skyship has passed
overhead, missing the top of the keep and the

311
00:20:40,436 --> 00:20:47,416
highest walls by about 40 or so feet. For a few
seconds of silence, and you hear impact,

312
00:20:47,457 --> 00:20:53,337
shaking the ground for a few seconds. Not far from
here, you can see another blast of red fire and a

313
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:57,833
couple of sparks of arcane energy that arc out, as
another column of smoke south of you begins to

314
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,436
pour up into the sky.

315
00:20:59,436 --> 00:21:05,529
MARISHA: Feeling that, I snap out of it and run to
the south exit of the castle to look for the

316
00:21:05,529 --> 00:21:06,642
explosion.

317
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:11,658
MATT: Okay. As you start rushing in that
direction, to the south side of the castle,

318
00:21:11,658 --> 00:21:18,195
looking back to where the skyship came through,
you can see the smoke parts once more, and you see

319
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:28,399
unfurling from within two large white wings
bearing down, and you can see as it swoops down,

320
00:21:28,399 --> 00:21:35,464
there are groups of people that are rushing 100,
200, 300 feet away, that are pulling themselves

321
00:21:35,464 --> 00:21:41,030
out of the ravine that sits between the south
walls of Emon and the north walls of your keep. As

322
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:44,834
they're pouring through the mud and the stream there,
it's about four or five feet deep, it swoops down

323
00:21:44,834 --> 00:21:51,797
and unleashes a blast of freezing cold energy that
freezes that whole section of the river solid and

324
00:21:51,797 --> 00:21:56,090
every person in that vicinity as well. Locked in
place.

325
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:58,522
MARISHA: Does Keyleth see all of this?

326
00:21:58,522 --> 00:22:02,535
MATT: You don't see this because you're 
inside the wall. You see it come down and swoop

327
00:22:02,535 --> 00:22:07,094
by. You see it circle around. You, however, have a
good view of this, right as you're about to go

328
00:22:07,094 --> 00:22:09,598
down the wall on the ladder.

329
00:22:09,644 --> 00:22:11,448
TALIESIN: Vex, I need you on the roof.

330
00:22:11,448 --> 00:22:13,402
LAURA: All right. I run up.

331
00:22:13,402 --> 00:22:20,535
MATT: As you go running up, you guys see now it
circles back around and its wings tilt to one side

332
00:22:20,535 --> 00:22:25,725
as it begins to make its way towards the keep for
a second sweep. I would like everyone to roll

333
00:22:25,725 --> 00:22:26,872
initiative.

334
00:22:26,872 --> 00:22:28,541
TRAVIS: Yeah, we got to get down.

335
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:32,187
MARISHA: Natural 20.

336
00:22:32,187 --> 00:22:35,086
TRAVIS: You want to go first?

337
00:22:35,086 --> 00:22:41,793
MATT: Put you there. Percy and Vex, you guys are
up on the wall, technically, right?

338
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:48,055
TALIESIN: Up here, so we can get down real quick.

339
00:22:48,055 --> 00:22:50,345
MATT: Okay, yeah, so the ladder is there.

340
00:22:50,345 --> 00:22:53,832
TALIESIN: Well, shouldn't there be a door that
leads to that anyway?

341
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:57,708
MATT: The way this is designed is it's a ladder
getting up and down.

342
00:22:57,708 --> 00:22:59,621
TALIESIN: Okay. That'll do.

343
00:22:59,621 --> 00:23:02,030
MATT: Did you still go down the ladder, or are you
staying up top here?

344
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:04,110
LIAM: No, I already said I went down.

345
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:07,362
MATT: Okay, so as soon as you see it swoop
overhead, you come back down to the bottom there.

346
00:23:07,362 --> 00:23:14,418
Scanlan is currently inside for the sake of this,
and may come out here in a moment, he's figuring

347
00:23:14,418 --> 00:23:16,515
out what's going on. Grog, where are you?

348
00:23:16,515 --> 00:23:21,677
TRAVIS: I guess I was out in the courtyard, trying
to help the cattle come in.

349
00:23:21,677 --> 00:23:24,976
MATT: All right, so let's go ahead and place some
cattle.

350
00:23:24,976 --> 00:23:27,881
LAURA: Jesus.

351
00:23:27,881 --> 00:23:35,685
TRAVIS: The door to get back inside is located
where?

352
00:23:35,685 --> 00:23:40,019
LAURA: Yeah, where's the cathedral at? Is that what
the other entry is?

353
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:45,833
MATT: This is the entrance to your actual keep,
there. Essentially, these two sections here are

354
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:54,147
the doors that lead through to the interior.
People are pouring through at this point, trying

355
00:23:54,147 --> 00:23:59,259
to get through as fast as possible. Whole cluster
of them.

356
00:23:59,259 --> 00:24:01,319
TALIESIN: Got to get that thing finished.

357
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:04,392
LAURA: There's more on the outside there? Is that
what you're putting there?

358
00:24:04,392 --> 00:24:06,672
MATT: Pike, you are where?

359
00:24:06,672 --> 00:24:13,038
ASHLEY: Yeah. Somewhere around there.

360
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:16,702
MATT: In the center, keeping watch there, all
right, and Trinket is with you-- or Trinket can't

361
00:24:16,702 --> 00:24:19,560
make it up the ladder, so Trinket is staying in
the courtyard, probably keeping close to Pike

362
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:30,303
right there. All righty, so. Initiative. 25 to
20.

363
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:31,371
LIAM: 24.

364
00:24:31,371 --> 00:24:32,176
MARISHA: 22.

365
00:24:32,176 --> 00:24:37,518
TALIESIN: 27. 26, 26.

366
00:24:37,562 --> 00:24:38,785
MATT: What did you get, Keyleth?

367
00:24:38,785 --> 00:24:40,164
MARISHA: 22.

368
00:24:40,164 --> 00:24:46,468
MATT: All right. Who got 20 to 15?

369
00:24:46,468 --> 00:24:47,871
LAURA: 15.

370
00:24:47,871 --> 00:24:53,178
MATT: 15. Pike, what did you get?

371
00:24:53,178 --> 00:24:54,587
ASHLEY: Three!

372
00:24:54,587 --> 00:24:56,510
MATT: Three. Grog?

373
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,442
TRAVIS: Nine.

374
00:24:57,442 --> 00:25:03,895
ASHLEY: I can do some cleanup.

375
00:25:03,895 --> 00:25:06,266
(laughter)

376
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:07,888
TRAVIS: Three!

377
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:10,671
ASHLEY: Matt, real quick.

378
00:25:10,671 --> 00:25:15,102
TRAVIS: He said 'yeah', you can go ahead.

379
00:25:15,102 --> 00:25:21,864
ASHLEY: Oh, I think I do have a sixth level because
I think that sixth level was used for Liam with the

380
00:25:21,864 --> 00:25:24,622
worm, and then we came back to the keep to rest.

381
00:25:24,622 --> 00:25:30,098
MATT: That's right, that's correct, you do have a sixth
level spell, still. Yes, thank you for the

382
00:25:30,098 --> 00:25:35,219
reminder. Good on you. All right, and so here we
have Cordell, we have Shayne, and we have Kendrick

383
00:25:35,219 --> 00:25:46,586
right there on the top, as well. Top, currently
the dragon is about, I'd say, 120 feet off this

384
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:49,309
direction. You're up first, Percy.

385
00:25:49,309 --> 00:25:54,077
TALIESIN: Does it seem like the dragon has noticed
us?

386
00:25:54,077 --> 00:26:00,717
MATT: The dragon at the moment is currently seeing
the keep. It doesn't notice anyone in particular,

387
00:26:00,717 --> 00:26:05,161
it just sees a swarm of people trying to get
inside, and it's circling around to try and do

388
00:26:05,161 --> 00:26:06,858
another dive attack.

389
00:26:06,858 --> 00:26:08,508
TALIESIN: How dumb am I?

390
00:26:08,508 --> 00:26:09,652
MATT: That's up to you, buddy.

391
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:10,866
TALIESIN: Okay, cool.

392
00:26:10,866 --> 00:26:13,781
LAURA: Don't be real dumb because I'm standing
next to you.

393
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:25,459
TALIESIN: All right. I'm going to pull out Bad
News, and I'm going to make a targeted shot at its

394
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:27,955
wings and try to put a hole into its wings.

395
00:26:27,955 --> 00:26:30,184
MATT: Okay, go for it, go ahead and take the
shot.

396
00:26:30,184 --> 00:26:32,028
TRAVIS: What the fuck.

397
00:26:32,028 --> 00:26:37,376
Come on, golden snitch.

398
00:26:37,376 --> 00:26:40,093
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

399
00:26:40,093 --> 00:26:42,164
(cheering)

400
00:26:42,164 --> 00:26:43,651
TRAVIS: Get the hell out of here.

401
00:26:43,651 --> 00:26:45,464
TALIESIN: I'm back, baby.

402
00:26:45,464 --> 00:26:47,646
MATT: Go ahead and roll some damage on that.

403
00:26:47,646 --> 00:26:52,318
LIAM: A little, tiny ray of sunshine.

404
00:26:52,318 --> 00:27:00,945
MATT: 4d12 for the hit on that, and then what's
the save, to see if it can maintain height?

405
00:27:00,945 --> 00:27:04,416
TALIESIN: It's a constitution saving throw.

406
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:08,502
MATT: All right-- (laughs) It rolled a four.

407
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:09,589
TALIESIN: Yeah!

408
00:27:09,589 --> 00:27:16,706
MATT: It is plus 14 to its constitution saving
throw, so it's 18. What's the DC on that?

409
00:27:16,706 --> 00:27:22,982
TALIESIN: Eight plus my proficiency mod plus my
dexterity mod-- So, I don't know-- six, seven,

410
00:27:22,982 --> 00:27:24,815
eight, nine, ten, 18.

411
00:27:24,815 --> 00:27:26,593
MATT: So it just makes the save.

412
00:27:26,593 --> 00:27:28,360
TALIESIN: Hold on, is that right? It's proficiency
bonus.

413
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,967
MATT: Proficiency bonus plus four.

414
00:27:29,967 --> 00:27:31,869
TALIESIN: Plus dexterity, which is six.

415
00:27:31,869 --> 00:27:37,518
MATT: Six, which is 18, and it just makes the
save.

416
00:27:37,518 --> 00:27:38,964
TALIESIN: Stupid dragon.

417
00:27:38,964 --> 00:27:41,085
MATT: Just makes its save, but still does damage,
go ahead and roll that.

418
00:27:41,085 --> 00:27:52,310
TRAVIS: At least you hit it, you got to bleed it a
bit. Longshot.

419
00:27:52,310 --> 00:28:14,943
TALIESIN: 27 points of damage. Let's see, one
more, yeah, one more shot at the wings just to see

420
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,381
if I can take it down. Make it.

421
00:28:17,381 --> 00:28:20,917
MATT: Okay, the second attack is reload, third
attack. Another grit point to try and take it

422
00:28:20,917 --> 00:28:23,486
down, go for it. Roll for the attack.

423
00:28:23,486 --> 00:28:27,833
TALIESIN: 25.

424
00:28:27,833 --> 00:28:35,119
MATT: 25 hits. It rolled a three, that is 17.

425
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:37,414
TALIESIN: (laughs) Drop, fucker!

426
00:28:37,414 --> 00:28:41,869
MATT: Terrible, terrible-- All right, so that will
effectively reduce its speed, or its height, by

427
00:28:41,869 --> 00:28:42,784
what?

428
00:28:42,784 --> 00:28:46,661
TALIESIN: Height by 20 feet? And I imagine that
would throw it a bit.

429
00:28:46,661 --> 00:28:48,039
MATT: It might.

430
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:49,357
LIAM: Now it's angry.

431
00:28:49,357 --> 00:29:00,699
TALIESIN: And let's do some damage. And damage is
20 points of damage.

432
00:29:00,699 --> 00:29:04,887
MATT: 20, nice. All right. 27 points of damage on
the round.

433
00:29:04,887 --> 00:29:09,629
TALIESIN: I'm going to hold my movement until it's
so close that I want-- I'm going to hold my

434
00:29:09,629 --> 00:29:10,956
movement until--

435
00:29:10,956 --> 00:29:12,807
MATT: You can hold an action, you can't really
hold movement.

436
00:29:12,807 --> 00:29:23,188
TALIESIN: Okay, then I'm going to use my bonus
action to turn to Vex and: fight or flight? All

437
00:29:23,188 --> 00:29:26,086
right, you can answer next turn, yeah.

438
00:29:26,086 --> 00:29:30,410
MATT: However, as the first bullet hits, you see
it takes the hit in the wing, but it hits the

439
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:35,732
muscle on the edge. As it goes into its glide to head
down, you fire into the other wing, this time

440
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:41,991
blowing a hole through the leather flap, and you can see
it lose about 20 feet and is actually now skidding

441
00:29:41,991 --> 00:29:43,669
towards the roof of the keep.

442
00:29:43,669 --> 00:29:45,078
LAURA: Oh jeez.

443
00:29:45,078 --> 00:29:46,658
TALIESIN: That was a good plan?

444
00:29:46,658 --> 00:29:50,235
MATT: Okay, that ends your turn. Vax, you're up.

445
00:29:50,235 --> 00:29:56,826
LIAM: I'm going to dive by that tree.

446
00:29:56,826 --> 00:29:57,930
MATT: Right here?

447
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,850
LIAM: Yeah, I'm going to use my bonus action to
hide.

448
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:01,021
MATT: All right.

449
00:30:01,021 --> 00:30:06,012
LIAM: And I'm going to hold my attack until it is
on the ground or low to the ground.

450
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:10,271
MATT: All right, got it. So you're holding your
attack if you can. All right, cool. Keyleth.

451
00:30:10,271 --> 00:30:13,448
MARISHA: Where am I in regards to everyone else?

452
00:30:13,448 --> 00:30:15,894
MATT: You are right here, because you were heading
to the south wall when all this went down.

453
00:30:15,894 --> 00:30:17,239
MARISHA: Oh, okay.

454
00:30:17,239 --> 00:30:22,063
MATT: This is the north direction this way. It
came this way, swooped past, circled around, and

455
00:30:22,063 --> 00:30:23,843
now it's coming back from this direction.

456
00:30:23,843 --> 00:30:28,685
MARISHA: Okay. I want to use my movement to get
under that tree.

457
00:30:28,685 --> 00:30:31,753
MATT: Under this tree or that tree?

458
00:30:31,753 --> 00:30:36,328
MARISHA: Yeah, let me-- No, towards the entrance--
heading for cover.

459
00:30:36,328 --> 00:30:37,560
TRAVIS: Yeah.

460
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,543
MATT: Here.

461
00:30:38,543 --> 00:30:39,634
MARISHA: Yeah.

462
00:30:39,634 --> 00:30:41,244
MATT: Okay, so you're behind the tree.

463
00:30:41,244 --> 00:30:55,111
MARISHA: And now I'm going to cast Fog Cloud at
fourth level, which makes it a radius of 80 feet.

464
00:30:55,111 --> 00:30:57,634
MATT: 80-foot radius?

465
00:30:57,634 --> 00:31:03,990
MARISHA: If you cast it at higher levels, it goes
up by 20 feet for each level higher you cast it.

466
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:14,719
So I'm casting it at fourth level. Okay, so I go all
Storm for a second, get all misty-eyed, and I want

467
00:31:14,719 --> 00:31:19,907
to create a nice low-level fog. Across the whole
castle.

468
00:31:19,907 --> 00:31:33,777
MATT: Okay. Okay, so heavily obscured. Heavily
obscured will give everyone a 3/4 cover bonus--

469
00:31:33,777 --> 00:31:42,999
Let me see what heavily obscured would actually do
specifically, to be sure real fast, pardon me.

470
00:31:42,999 --> 00:31:45,984
TRAVIS: I don't even know what 3/4 cover bonus
is.

471
00:31:45,984 --> 00:31:48,123
MATT: It's when you're blocked by something, it
gives you a bonus to--

472
00:31:48,123 --> 00:31:54,527
TRAVIS: Never happens to me. I'm usually a 3/4
cover bonus.

473
00:31:54,527 --> 00:32:07,180
MATT: All right. It blocks vision entirely,
creatures suffer from the blinded condition. So

474
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:10,103
everyone in the entire Keep is now blinded.

475
00:32:10,103 --> 00:32:14,842
MARISHA: Well, I want to make it like a fog cloud
over top, so we're blinded by--

476
00:32:14,842 --> 00:32:17,042
MATT: So it's above you guys, is what you're
saying?

477
00:32:17,042 --> 00:32:22,149
MARISHA: Yeah, so we're blocked from the dragon as
we flee. I hope you guys weren't wanting to shoot

478
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:23,448
at it, by the way.

479
00:32:23,448 --> 00:32:26,121
TALIESIN: Well, we're above it, the cloud would be
between--

480
00:32:26,121 --> 00:32:32,250
MATT: The cloud now is-- encompasses this whole
area here. Which means the only people that are

481
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:38,276
affected by it are the people at the top of this
tower right now. Got it. Was that your turn? Your

482
00:32:38,276 --> 00:32:39,290
movement?

483
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,246
MARISHA: That's it.

484
00:32:40,246 --> 00:32:41,460
MATT: Cool, stay there?

485
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,432
MARISHA: Well, I moved.

486
00:32:42,432 --> 00:32:46,454
MATT: Right, you moved there. Are you done with
your turn? Okay. So now it is the white dragon's

487
00:32:46,454 --> 00:32:51,391
turn. The white dragon, as it comes down, you
don't see it anymore because the fog cloud

488
00:32:51,391 --> 00:32:59,162
obscures it, but you suddenly hear the sound of a
heavy object slamming into stone, and the cracking

489
00:32:59,162 --> 00:33:04,195
and breaking of stone against the surface, as the
dragon has now, due to the fall of height, slammed

490
00:33:04,195 --> 00:33:09,769
into the top of the Keep and is tearing its
underside against the roof. Who knows the state

491
00:33:09,769 --> 00:33:13,739
that the roof of the Keep is going to be in right
now, but because of that, I'm going to ahead and--

492
00:33:13,739 --> 00:33:16,223
LAURA: We'll just have Riskel fix it-- Oh, wait.

493
00:33:16,223 --> 00:33:22,054
MATT: Well, he was the overseer. He actually had
somebody else build the actual thing by hand.

494
00:33:22,054 --> 00:33:25,198
LAURA: Oh, okay. Well, good.

495
00:33:25,198 --> 00:33:29,103
MATT: So it suffers 14 points of damage--

496
00:33:29,103 --> 00:33:30,305
LAURA: That's it?

497
00:33:30,305 --> 00:33:31,982
MATT: Yeah. It's dragonhide, man.

498
00:33:31,982 --> 00:33:36,432
TRAVIS: What about all the spires that are up
there, that have anti-dragon poison?

499
00:33:36,432 --> 00:33:44,072
MATT: Yeah. That was a dream, unfortunately.
However, it does somewhat emerge-- you can see its

500
00:33:44,072 --> 00:33:49,285
form somewhat as it comes down in this direction,
ending its movement here.

501
00:33:49,285 --> 00:33:51,171
TRAVIS: Oh no.

502
00:33:51,171 --> 00:33:56,479
MARISHA: Wait, it skids to a halt right there?

503
00:33:56,479 --> 00:34:01,886
MATT: It's just the fog cloud. As it slams into
the keep and tumbles off the top of it and catches

504
00:34:01,886 --> 00:34:03,738
itself in the air (wingbeats).

505
00:34:03,738 --> 00:34:13,787
TRAVIS: How high above us is it?

506
00:34:13,787 --> 00:34:23,080
MATT: It is currently 20 feet above you guys. For
its turn, it is going to pick a random direction

507
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:30,033
to try and blast its cold breath at. So let me go
ahead and roll the direction on this.

508
00:34:30,033 --> 00:34:32,320
LAURA: Because it's all covered in fog?

509
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,929
MATT: Yeah, it can't see right now. Currently it's
obscured. Oh, hold on! But it has

510
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:42,334
blindsight 60 feet, so it has no effect on him,
unfortunately. So as it stops in the air, it still

511
00:34:42,334 --> 00:34:48,411
manages to use its sense of smell and the general
atmospheric ability to sense what's around it. It

512
00:34:48,411 --> 00:34:51,187
seem to move its head and search--

513
00:34:51,187 --> 00:34:52,693
LIAM: Can I attack right now? I was holding my
attack.

514
00:34:52,693 --> 00:34:54,387
MATT: You can. Now, what's the range on your
daggers?

515
00:34:54,387 --> 00:34:57,868
LIAM: 60, because I'm Sharpshooter.

516
00:34:57,868 --> 00:35:03,232
MATT: 30, 40, 50, 60-- it's just at the cusp. Like
just barely cusp, but yeah, you can get your

517
00:35:03,232 --> 00:35:04,136
attack.

518
00:35:04,136 --> 00:35:07,073
LIAM: So I'm going before him, and it's a surprise
attack because I'm hidden and I'm going first--

519
00:35:07,073 --> 00:35:10,756
MATT: Yes, you're essentially interrupting his
attack because the moment he came into range--

520
00:35:10,756 --> 00:35:13,576
LIAM: So it's an advantage and it is an automatic
crit?

521
00:35:13,576 --> 00:35:17,257
MATT: It's not a automatic crit, it's not
surprised.

522
00:35:17,257 --> 00:35:18,404
LIAM: It's not surprised?

523
00:35:18,404 --> 00:35:19,778
MATT: No, it know you guys are there.

524
00:35:19,778 --> 00:35:21,042
LIAM: Even hiding behind a tree? All right.

525
00:35:21,042 --> 00:35:24,350
MATT: A surprise generally means that it has
absolutely no idea that you are there or there's

526
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:25,626
any sort of threat from you.

527
00:35:25,626 --> 00:35:26,789
LIAM: 24.

528
00:35:26,789 --> 00:35:27,785
MATT: 24 hits.

529
00:35:27,785 --> 00:35:32,829
LIAM: All right. And then the second dagger I
throw-- I can only throw a second one-- is also a

530
00:35:32,829 --> 00:35:33,711
24.

531
00:35:33,711 --> 00:35:34,790
MATT: Both hit.

532
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:52,819
LIAM: So the first one is double dice, so eight
plus-- 14, 15, 18, 23, 25. Double dice is 50 plus

533
00:35:52,819 --> 00:35:56,916
seven is-- Yeah, 57 for the first.

534
00:35:56,916 --> 00:35:58,923
MATT: Ooh, nice.

535
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:03,067
LIAM: And the second one goes bink. That is a
ten.

536
00:36:03,067 --> 00:36:11,315
MATT: Ten, all right. 57 points of damage,
that's-- Is that straight-up dice rolls? That's

537
00:36:11,315 --> 00:36:12,182
crazy.

538
00:36:12,182 --> 00:36:14,290
LIAM: That's Sneak Attack, I've gone up a level to
13--

539
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:16,361
MATT: Right, so it's a d6 or 7d6.

540
00:36:16,361 --> 00:36:18,788
LIAM: 7d6-- Oh, wait.

541
00:36:18,788 --> 00:36:19,898
MATT: It's not doubled, though.

542
00:36:19,898 --> 00:36:26,444
LIAM: Sorry, sorry, sorry. 25 plus seven is 32.
Sorry, 32.

543
00:36:26,444 --> 00:36:29,061
MATT: 32, there you go, I was like, that's
really high for a non-crit.

544
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:31,169
LIAM: The second one was ten. 32, ten.

545
00:36:31,169 --> 00:36:36,096
MATT: So 42 points of damage. Still not shabby by
any means. Gotcha, as you chuck both daggers in

546
00:36:36,096 --> 00:36:41,273
the direction where you can see as it's now at
the very bottom of the fog cloud. You have enough

547
00:36:41,273 --> 00:36:46,066
visual to strike towards it without missing and
both daggers sink into the bottom of the creature.

548
00:36:46,066 --> 00:36:53,692
One of them you know was a nice, impactful
wounding for any other creature, but it doesn't

549
00:36:53,692 --> 00:37:00,281
seem to have taken much issue with the impact of
the blade. Appear at your side again. That ends

550
00:37:00,281 --> 00:37:05,856
your reaction. Now Vorugal is going to go. Looking
at the area of most density--

551
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:07,864
LIAM: What was his name again?

552
00:37:07,864 --> 00:37:17,379
MATT: Ah, you will know that shortly. The white
dragon. The white dragon rears up in the fog cloud

553
00:37:17,379 --> 00:37:26,157
and dips down a little bit, (exhales) outside of
the fog cloud, hitting everyone in this vicinity

554
00:37:26,157 --> 00:37:42,596
here. That's going to be Grog, Trinket, and
everyone here over. I would like all of you to

555
00:37:42,596 --> 00:37:49,262
make a constitution saving throw. Well, I'm not
going to roll that many dice, I'm going to use my

556
00:37:49,262 --> 00:37:50,248
dice roller.

557
00:37:50,248 --> 00:37:51,892
ASHLEY: Come on, guys.

558
00:37:51,892 --> 00:37:54,855
MARISHA: "I'm not going to roll that many dice."
Always a good sign.

559
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:56,793
LIAM: Grog's about to lose ten percent of his hit
points.

560
00:37:56,793 --> 00:38:06,473
MATT: I don't have enough d6s, it's 16d6. Or
sorry, 16d8, my apologies. All right, so that

561
00:38:06,473 --> 00:38:09,321
comes to-- Grog, what's your--

562
00:38:09,321 --> 00:38:10,735
TRAVIS: 25.

563
00:38:10,735 --> 00:38:13,161
MATT: 25, that's a success. What's Trinket's?

564
00:38:13,161 --> 00:38:14,344
LAURA: 15.

565
00:38:14,344 --> 00:38:18,860
MATT: 15? All right, that is 63 points of cold
damage to Trinket.

566
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,618
LAURA: Trinket is unconscious.

567
00:38:20,618 --> 00:38:26,331
MATT: All right. Trinket actually freezes in
place. Now you can see the armor itself has about

568
00:38:26,331 --> 00:38:33,377
an inch-thick layer of ice as currently the eyes
go dull as unconsciousness takes the bear, but

569
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:41,883
unable to show or reveal that. Grog, you take half
that, so you are at-- you take 32 points of cold

570
00:38:41,883 --> 00:38:54,218
damage. Let me roll some saves here. Average
saves-- Okay, so these four here survive, the rest

571
00:38:54,218 --> 00:39:01,610
of these are all entirely wiped out. And you can
see now, the people that were rushing in are now

572
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:16,625
rushing away from the keep. The rest are getting
the fuck out of Dodge. So yeah, that's going to be

573
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:23,334
the end of the white dragon's turn. That brings us
to Vex. You're up in the fog cloud right now, so

574
00:39:23,334 --> 00:39:28,320
you have no visual range on the creature. You hear
all these screams and hear the blast.

575
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,553
LAURA: I can't see it?

576
00:39:29,553 --> 00:39:33,533
MATT: No, unfortunately, the fog cloud is just
high enough where it covers this area for you

577
00:39:33,533 --> 00:39:41,411
guys. However, you could jump off if you wanted
to, make an acrobatics roll and then maybe do your

578
00:39:41,411 --> 00:39:43,874
attack afterwards. If you wanted to try that, your
call.

579
00:39:43,874 --> 00:39:48,162
LAURA: Wouldn't I still be in the fog cloud if I
was on the ground?

580
00:39:48,162 --> 00:39:52,609
MATT: No, the fog cloud is elevated up here. It
starts here and then goes upward. Keyleth created

581
00:39:52,609 --> 00:39:56,116
it in the air. You guys are at the base of it
right now.

582
00:39:56,116 --> 00:39:57,868
LAURA: So I can use my movement to jump down?

583
00:39:57,868 --> 00:39:59,111
MATT: Yes, if you want to.

584
00:39:59,111 --> 00:40:01,321
LAURA: All right, I'm going to fucking Hunter's
Mark him.

585
00:40:01,321 --> 00:40:03,452
MATT: You can't see him right now, unfortunately.

586
00:40:03,452 --> 00:40:05,473
LAURA: I'm going to jump fucking down on the
ground.

587
00:40:05,473 --> 00:40:10,000
MATT: So you jump. Go ahead and make an acrobatics
check. As you leap off the highest part of the

588
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,357
wall of your Keep, all of a sudden the fog
dissipates and you see the ground rushing up

589
00:40:14,357 --> 00:40:15,522
towards you.

590
00:40:15,522 --> 00:40:19,836
LAURA: 14.

591
00:40:19,836 --> 00:40:28,401
MATT: 14. You manage to catch yourself. You aren't
knocked prone, but you do suffer five points of

592
00:40:28,401 --> 00:40:34,271
damage from the fall. But you catch yourself
(grunts), get up, and now you can see at the very,

593
00:40:34,271 --> 00:40:39,683
very base of the fog cloud, the head peeking
though and the wings occasionally (wingbeats) from

594
00:40:39,683 --> 00:40:42,481
out underneath, and you have visual on the
dragon.

595
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:49,926
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to Hunter's Mark him. And
I'm going to shoot him through the Sky Sentinel.

596
00:40:49,926 --> 00:40:54,794
MATT: You already used the Sky Sentinel if I
recall against the green dragon, didn't you?

597
00:40:54,794 --> 00:40:56,118
LAURA: On the worm.

598
00:40:56,118 --> 00:40:57,450
MATT: Was it the worm? Okay.

599
00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:06,838
LAURA: And I multiclassed today, so I'm a rogue,
so I get Sneak Attack on this.

600
00:41:06,838 --> 00:41:09,820
MATT: It currently does not have--

601
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:13,228
LAURA: Does it know that-- does it see me?

602
00:41:13,228 --> 00:41:19,985
MATT: You haven't tried to stealth, so technically
yes. As soon as you jumped off and land, and hurt

603
00:41:19,985 --> 00:41:22,388
yourself and your ankle, you look up and it sees
you.

604
00:41:22,388 --> 00:41:28,626
LAURA: Never fucking mind. Balls, all kind of
balls around here right now. The first attack is

605
00:41:28,626 --> 00:41:29,781
25.

606
00:41:29,781 --> 00:41:31,027
MATT: 25 hits.

607
00:41:31,027 --> 00:41:33,910
LAURA: The second attack is 24.

608
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:34,978
MATT: Both hit.

609
00:41:34,978 --> 00:41:37,703
LAURA: The third attack is 16.

610
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:39,312
MATT: 16 misses.

611
00:41:39,312 --> 00:42:03,371
LAURA: Okay, so. Let me double-check. An extra d6
for those two. 15 plus seven is what?

612
00:42:03,371 --> 00:42:06,630
LIAM: 15 plus seven is 22.

613
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:18,700
LAURA: 22 on the first arrow. 15 plus four is 19
on the second arrow. I'm a little upset right now.

614
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:22,804
And then I'm going to shoot the third arrow
through the Blazing Bowstring. I mean my second

615
00:42:22,804 --> 00:42:23,799
attack.

616
00:42:23,799 --> 00:42:25,181
MATT: Okay.

617
00:42:25,181 --> 00:42:29,667
LAURA: And that doesn't hit him, so. Good times.

618
00:42:29,667 --> 00:42:34,148
MATT: So as you land, you get up, pull out your
arrow, and as you pull back and release it, you

619
00:42:34,148 --> 00:42:37,998
can see it bursts into arcane energy and splits
into three different arrows, two slamming into the

620
00:42:37,998 --> 00:42:41,693
fog cloud and hitting the sides of the dragon, and
it's knocked around for a second. It looks around

621
00:42:41,693 --> 00:42:44,587
and its eyes peer at you-- You did the additional
Hunter's Mark damage on it, right?

622
00:42:44,587 --> 00:42:45,422
LAURA: I did.

623
00:42:45,422 --> 00:42:51,015
MATT: Cool. You see now it's looking around,
choosing what its next round is going to be about,

624
00:42:51,015 --> 00:42:56,290
and you seem like a tasty morsel, though not
entirely drawn to its attention at the moment. You

625
00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:58,106
still have a little bit of movement if you wanted to
move.

626
00:42:58,106 --> 00:43:01,704
LAURA: Can I-- No.

627
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:08,336
TALIESIN: Just for clarification: which door is
back into the keep? That one. Okay.

628
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:10,915
LAURA: Is it possible to get inside the door?

629
00:43:10,915 --> 00:43:12,152
MATT: Inside of--

630
00:43:12,152 --> 00:43:15,717
LAURA: The door that I'm right there-- If I backed
up into the door?

631
00:43:15,717 --> 00:43:21,923
MATT: Yeah, I'd say you could. We'll say you're
inside right now. You hide inside the best you can

632
00:43:21,923 --> 00:43:23,173
to keep out of view.

633
00:43:23,173 --> 00:43:26,714
LAURA: Yeah, I want to be ducked around a wall,
if I can, on the inside of the door.

634
00:43:26,714 --> 00:43:29,314
MATT: Okay. That ends your turn?

635
00:43:29,314 --> 00:43:31,839
LAURA: Yes.

636
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:39,064
MATT: All right, so, at that point now, your
guards over here don't have-- they can't see at

637
00:43:39,064 --> 00:43:44,552
all, but they saw you jump off the side. Kendrick
is going to go ahead and take the ladder down, and

638
00:43:44,552 --> 00:43:48,836
it's going to be his movement to land there.
They're both going to jump and make your-- using

639
00:43:48,836 --> 00:43:55,600
your example. Cordell, not bad, and Shayne--
actually, both rolled pretty well. Both managed to

640
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:59,859
prevent any fall damage, catching themselves on
the ground with their heavy crossbows ready. They

641
00:43:59,859 --> 00:44:10,450
rush up and fire both at the dragon. Five and a
one, god damn-- That hits, and a 19. All right, so

642
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:21,243
Cordell and Shayne both manage to get one shot
that hits the dragon on both sides. So both bolts

643
00:44:21,243 --> 00:44:28,797
hit, so that's seven damage and ten damage, so 17
damage total from them, as they fire the heavy

644
00:44:28,797 --> 00:44:37,335
crossbow, try and reload it and get off a second
shot. That ends their turn, now. That brings us to

645
00:44:37,335 --> 00:44:38,509
Grog's turn.

646
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,782
TRAVIS: I would like to rage.

647
00:44:40,782 --> 00:44:41,958
MATT: Okay.

648
00:44:41,958 --> 00:44:43,943
TRAVIS: And run at Trinket.

649
00:44:43,943 --> 00:44:45,279
MATT: Okay.

650
00:44:45,279 --> 00:44:48,807
TRAVIS: He's covered in how much ice?

651
00:44:48,807 --> 00:44:55,505
MATT: About an inch, inch and a half of ice, and
the rest of the entities, all the rest of the

652
00:44:55,505 --> 00:44:59,524
people that died, they all got frozen in place and
some of them shattered in the impact and there's

653
00:44:59,524 --> 00:45:01,250
chunks of them frozen on the ground.

654
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:07,610
LIAM: Is that a medicine check at this point? If
Trinket is frozen in ice? You can't say--

655
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:08,705
MATT: You have no idea.

656
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:12,487
LIAM: Thanks. Could I pee on him and thaw him out,
quickly?

657
00:45:12,487 --> 00:45:17,315
MATT: Over time, yeah. You'll have to drink a lot
beforehand and wait a little while, jog in place.

658
00:45:17,315 --> 00:45:19,487
What you got, Grog?

659
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:25,526
TRAVIS: I would like to run to the side that is
closest to you, on Trinket. I would like to start

660
00:45:25,526 --> 00:45:31,021
pushing him along the lawn, towards the entrance
to the Keep, like a giant ice block.

661
00:45:31,021 --> 00:45:36,861
MATT: Okay, so this side there. Go ahead and make a
strength check.

662
00:45:36,861 --> 00:45:38,221
TRAVIS: Okay.

663
00:45:38,221 --> 00:45:40,356
MATT: Because you are raging, you have advantage
on strength checks.

664
00:45:40,356 --> 00:45:43,261
TRAVIS: Yes, thank god. 18.

665
00:45:43,261 --> 00:45:52,415
MATT: 18, okay. You did suffer damage this
turn, but you started raging this turn, so if you

666
00:45:52,415 --> 00:45:54,886
don't suffer damage until the beginning of next
turn, your rage ends and you'll have to rage

667
00:45:54,886 --> 00:46:01,027
again. Just a heads up. But with that roll,
though, you managed to push him, we'll say 15 feet

668
00:46:01,027 --> 00:46:06,535
that direction. (grunts) Pushing a giant frozen
bear and he's sliding against the grass in the front

669
00:46:06,535 --> 00:46:13,705
of the courtyard. Sweat's beginning to pop on your
brow as your teeth are gritted, and looking over

670
00:46:13,705 --> 00:46:18,358
your shoulder, you can still hear the snapping and
the-- The air itself of the entire courtyard has

671
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:24,020
dropped about 20 degrees, and you can begin to see
your breath in the vicinity of this creature. That

672
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:25,497
ends your turn, Grog?

673
00:46:25,497 --> 00:46:26,350
TRAVIS: Yeah.

674
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:32,963
MATT: Scanlan now steps out from the inside of the
Keep, because Sam is texting me what he wants to

675
00:46:32,963 --> 00:46:38,158
do. He rushes out at this point. Seeing all of
this from the inside, he whips out his Wand of

676
00:46:38,158 --> 00:46:42,645
Fireballs and aims it up at the bottom of the dragon
that is now visible underneath. As you see now,

677
00:46:42,645 --> 00:46:47,742
the edge of the wand flickers red for a second,
before a little bead of light streaks forward and

678
00:46:47,742 --> 00:46:54,053
(explosion) detonates beneath it. The dragon would
fail its saving throw, but it's going to use its

679
00:46:54,053 --> 00:47:00,849
Legendary Resistance once to auto-save, so it
takes half damage. He is going to use-- What did

680
00:47:00,849 --> 00:47:09,620
he tell me, how many slots he wanted to do? Okay,
so he's going to use three of its charges to do

681
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:11,688
this one, that will put it at--

682
00:47:11,688 --> 00:47:19,436
LAURA: What is he doing?

683
00:47:19,436 --> 00:47:23,518
LIAM: He's trying to resist. Scanlan sent a
Fireball at it and it's fucking with it.

684
00:47:23,518 --> 00:47:30,157
MATT: 36 damage halved from him, so that still
puts it at 17 points of fire damage to it, not too

685
00:47:30,157 --> 00:47:36,289
shabby. As it blasts out from the opposite side of
it through the bottom of the cloud, keeping

686
00:47:36,289 --> 00:47:39,283
everyone else outside of the collateral damage
radius of the Fireball because of its height, so

687
00:47:39,283 --> 00:47:42,896
that's good. Scanlan then, realizing the
circumstances, uses the rest of his movement to

688
00:47:42,896 --> 00:47:47,904
get back into the very corner of the Keep and
defend himself against the wall. That's going to

689
00:47:47,904 --> 00:47:49,726
end Scanlan's turn. Pike, you're up.

690
00:47:49,726 --> 00:47:56,918
ASHLEY: All right, I'm-- Can I run over to where
Trinket is? Okay. I'm going to Cure Wounds on him.

691
00:47:56,918 --> 00:48:02,950
MATT: Okay. So you move over to Trinket. All
right, go ahead and cast Cure Wounds.

692
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:07,409
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to cast it at 4th-level.

693
00:48:07,409 --> 00:48:15,483
MATT: 4th-level, okay. 4d8 plus five.

694
00:48:15,483 --> 00:48:17,592
TRAVIS: On the floor.

695
00:48:17,592 --> 00:48:33,384
ASHLEY: Dang! 30.

696
00:48:33,384 --> 00:48:38,590
MATT: 30. Trinket heals up-- As Pike reaches out,
grasping her symbol in one hand, a look of

697
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:41,488
desperation in her face, her hand goes out and
touches the ice and as her hand touches, her

698
00:48:41,488 --> 00:48:45,738
fingers melt through through the ice with divine
energy in her fingertips, and manages to touch

699
00:48:45,738 --> 00:48:52,383
Trinket's fur beneath. As the divine energy
filters through her body, Trinket's form glows

700
00:48:52,383 --> 00:48:58,001
from the inside and the ice begins to crack before
it all shatters off of Trinket's body and Trinket

701
00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:05,820
catches himself (bear grunts) and shakes off what
little bit of remaining ice and moisture is on the coat.

702
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:07,128
LAURA: Thank you guys.

703
00:49:07,128 --> 00:49:10,261
ASHLEY: I want to scratch behind his ears.

704
00:49:10,261 --> 00:49:13,290
MATT: Okay. Trinket goes (bear noises) Trinket
nudges you and licks your face before looking up

705
00:49:13,290 --> 00:49:15,504
and growling very angrily at the dragon.

706
00:49:15,504 --> 00:49:20,508
LAURA: I don't think Vex even saw any of that,
like Vex doesn't even know he was unconscious.

707
00:49:20,508 --> 00:49:22,555
LIAM: Got to go Revenant on that bear!

708
00:49:22,555 --> 00:49:27,302
MATT: That is an angry bear, and those who have
seen the movie know how scary an angry bear is.

709
00:49:27,302 --> 00:49:32,018
Great. Pike, you still have a little bit of movement, if
you want to move. You have like 15 more feet, if

710
00:49:32,018 --> 00:49:33,681
you wanted to use that, your call.

711
00:49:33,681 --> 00:49:39,342
ASHLEY: Okay, you guys are my eyes, so I can't
really see it from here. But I guess anywhere

712
00:49:39,342 --> 00:49:43,536
there's cover. Is that a tree?

713
00:49:43,536 --> 00:49:47,400
MATT: You can start moving towards the tree or the
front of the keep, tree is closer but currently

714
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,801
has two other people hiding there.

715
00:49:48,801 --> 00:49:50,377
LIAM: Or behind the goliath.

716
00:49:50,377 --> 00:49:51,131
ASHLEY: What was that?

717
00:49:51,131 --> 00:49:52,212
LIAM: Behind the goliath.

718
00:49:52,212 --> 00:49:53,346
ASHLEY: Yeah!

719
00:49:53,346 --> 00:49:59,152
MATT: All right, you move over here and use Grog
as cover, we'll say, and leap over there. Classic

720
00:49:59,152 --> 00:50:00,486
Pike-Grog technique.

721
00:50:00,486 --> 00:50:02,934
(laughter)

722
00:50:02,934 --> 00:50:07,423
MATT: Cool. Ends your turn. The rest of these
survivors on this side of the wall are going to

723
00:50:07,423 --> 00:50:12,063
start fleeing in this direction, using their turn
to get the hell out. These guys here are going to

724
00:50:12,063 --> 00:50:19,519
do a full-round dash to get inside the keep, and
they manage to make it inside. These guys here are

725
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:25,470
moving back. Actually, no, these guys now that are
inside the keep are going to run, they get almost

726
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:34,947
all the way to the keep. There we go. The dwarf
gets about that far, this guy almost makes it in.

727
00:50:34,947 --> 00:50:39,120
They're all right at the cusp of getting into the
keep, screaming and running past you, moving

728
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:43,641
between the different frozen bodies, not even
paying attention to any of you, as the look of

729
00:50:43,641 --> 00:50:47,888
sheer terror on their faces has taken over. That
brings us to the top of the round. Percy, you're up.

730
00:50:47,888 --> 00:50:52,753
TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to drop down-- Like
a boss.

731
00:50:52,753 --> 00:50:54,514
MATT: Are you going to leap or climb down?

732
00:50:54,514 --> 00:50:55,517
TALIESIN: I'm going to leap.

733
00:50:55,517 --> 00:50:57,671
MATT: All right, and roll.

734
00:50:57,671 --> 00:50:59,854
TALIESIN: 29.

735
00:50:59,854 --> 00:51:05,756
MATT: 29, success and managed to avoid one of your
guards who was right below you. You weren't aware

736
00:51:05,756 --> 00:51:11,713
and managed to dodge off to the side this way and
use the edge of the wall to kick off to change the

737
00:51:11,713 --> 00:51:15,305
trajectory, as you land, carrying Bad News in one
hand, three-point landing in the other.

738
00:51:15,305 --> 00:51:16,801
LAURA: Sick, Percy.

739
00:51:16,801 --> 00:51:18,396
LIAM: Hold that gun up from the ground.

740
00:51:18,396 --> 00:51:20,804
MATT: Yep. Just making sure it doesn't damage
itself.

741
00:51:20,804 --> 00:51:25,482
TALIESIN: Okay, the next thing I'm going to do is,
I'm going to concentrate really hard and I'm going

742
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:27,861
to try and conjure Hex to see if it works.

743
00:51:27,861 --> 00:51:35,501
MATT: Okay. So as you focus and look up, you can
see now some of the fog cloud that surrounds it

744
00:51:35,501 --> 00:51:41,935
congeals into a darker color and clings to the
dragon's form as it is now Hexed by you.

745
00:51:41,935 --> 00:51:43,244
TALIESIN: It still works.

746
00:51:43,244 --> 00:51:47,603
MATT: Is seems that as long as the shadow entity
has been within you, though it is no longer bound

747
00:51:47,603 --> 00:51:52,828
to your weapon and yourself, it did leave some
dark scars on your soul.

748
00:51:52,828 --> 00:51:54,228
LIAM: Left a taint upon you.

749
00:51:54,228 --> 00:51:56,017
(laughter)

750
00:51:56,017 --> 00:52:02,406
TALIESIN: So, just to remind you, that means that
he has disadvantage on all agility checks.

751
00:52:02,406 --> 00:52:07,280
MATT: Are you choosing dexterity? Because you
choose which one of the--

752
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,657
TALIESIN: Oh, on which checks? Constitution.

753
00:52:10,657 --> 00:52:13,295
MATT: Constitution, all right. So I'll put that
down.

754
00:52:13,295 --> 00:52:14,966
LAURA: I like it, I like it.

755
00:52:14,966 --> 00:52:20,624
MATT: I'm not sure that's how it works here. 
Someone will yell it later.

756
00:52:20,624 --> 00:52:22,130
TALIESIN: Ability check, on any ability checks.

757
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:24,524
MATT: On ability checks, yes. Good to know.

758
00:52:24,524 --> 00:52:29,527
TALIESIN: I'm going to spend a grit point. I'm
going to take another shot to try and drop him.

759
00:52:29,527 --> 00:52:30,809
MATT: Even further?

760
00:52:30,809 --> 00:52:34,035
TALIESIN: Yeah. Just for fun.

761
00:52:34,035 --> 00:52:37,917
MATT: Because saving throws are-- I don't--

762
00:52:37,917 --> 00:52:42,181
TALIESIN: Are they not? Because I'll use that Grit
point for something else, if--

763
00:52:42,181 --> 00:52:50,702
MATT: I don't believe saves are ability checks,
unfortunately, so that wouldn't affect that. Yeah,

764
00:52:50,702 --> 00:52:52,196
it is its own circumstance.

765
00:52:52,196 --> 00:52:58,099
TALIESIN: It's its own circumstance? In that case,
I'm going to spend my point for Deadeye.

766
00:52:58,099 --> 00:53:01,390
MATT: Okay. Advantage on the shot.

767
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:02,703
TALIESIN: Advantage on the shot.

768
00:53:02,703 --> 00:53:04,110
MATT: Go for it.

769
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:10,934
TALIESIN: And do I want to go nuts? I'm going to
go nuts. I'm going to add Sharpshooter to that, might as well.

770
00:53:10,934 --> 00:53:17,229
MATT: You cannot overlap the shots. No, only one
shot effect on an attack at a time, sorry.

771
00:53:17,229 --> 00:53:18,885
TALIESIN: That's fine, here we go.

772
00:53:18,885 --> 00:53:20,498
TRAVIS: Come on, go nuts.

773
00:53:20,498 --> 00:53:23,226
TALIESIN: Both-- 25.

774
00:53:23,226 --> 00:53:24,598
MATT: 25 hits.

775
00:53:24,598 --> 00:53:27,548
TALIESIN: 2d12.

776
00:53:27,548 --> 00:53:29,418
MATT: And add your 1d6 damage as well.

777
00:53:29,418 --> 00:53:39,595
TALIESIN: Oh, thank you for reminding me-- 17
points of damage plus four points of necrotic damage.

778
00:53:39,595 --> 00:53:42,918
MATT: Nice. 21 damage total.

779
00:53:42,918 --> 00:53:51,486
TALIESIN: I'm going to use the rest of my movement
to duck in there. I want to try and spin all the

780
00:53:51,486 --> 00:53:54,515
way back so I'm completely out of sight. Is that
door open?

781
00:53:54,515 --> 00:53:56,084
MATT: There's a little space there, I mean.

782
00:53:56,084 --> 00:53:57,421
TALIESIN: Open the door.

783
00:53:57,421 --> 00:53:59,420
MARISHA: Does that lead to our keep?

784
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:03,545
TALIESIN: No, it's the other door that leads to
our keep. So we're both going to get in and

785
00:54:03,545 --> 00:54:05,114
dual-wall it.

786
00:54:05,114 --> 00:54:07,476
LAURA: Yeah!

787
00:54:07,476 --> 00:54:12,885
TALIESIN: And then I'm going to use my bonus action to
take one of my few remaining potions. The medium one.

788
00:54:12,885 --> 00:54:14,104
LAURA: Does the door actually open on it?

789
00:54:14,104 --> 00:54:14,926
MATT: Yeah.

790
00:54:14,926 --> 00:54:16,227
LAURA: Heh, that's so cool.

791
00:54:16,227 --> 00:54:20,464
TALIESIN: What does the mid-range potion do? I
should really start writing this down. Is it one--

792
00:54:20,464 --> 00:54:22,719
TRAVIS: Mid-range potion?

793
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:24,454
TALIESIN: The second-level potion.

794
00:54:24,454 --> 00:54:27,386
MATT: Of healing, you mean? That is--

795
00:54:27,386 --> 00:54:29,000
LIAM: 10d10.

796
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,365
MATT: Not so much. Second level, greater healing
is 4d4 plus four.

797
00:54:33,365 --> 00:54:34,461
TALIESIN: 4d4 plus four.

798
00:54:34,461 --> 00:54:37,614
MATT: You got it. All right, cool. That ends
Percy's turn, Vax, you're up.

799
00:54:37,614 --> 00:54:41,919
LIAM: I want to double check, the boots of speed
that I wear, it's ten rounds each day, the haste

800
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:47,484
effect's duration need not be consecutive rounds.
So it was one or two back in Emon, and I've had

801
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:48,605
one round here.

802
00:54:48,605 --> 00:54:50,886
MATT: That's the old Pathfinder rules.

803
00:54:50,886 --> 00:54:53,480
LIAM: So what is it, ten minutes now? I think it
remember the ten-minute thing--

804
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:59,956
MATT: No. Haste lasts for a minute, you get to use
the spell on you once. Yeah. In this ruleset, it's a

805
00:54:59,956 --> 00:55:02,670
little too much.

806
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:06,645
LIAM: All right, so, I'm going to dash towards the
tree in that corner and get away from this clump

807
00:55:06,645 --> 00:55:07,894
of my friends.

808
00:55:07,894 --> 00:55:08,823
MATT: Over this way?

809
00:55:08,823 --> 00:55:12,760
LIAM: Towards the wall, yeah. I should be able to
get behind that tree, I think, if I dash?

810
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:17,340
MATT: If you dash, yeah. Yeah, you can get over
there, behind that way.

811
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:28,830
LIAM: So then I'm going to throw a dagger, it's
all I can do. Can I use an action to hide? Or it's

812
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:30,263
a bonus action only?

813
00:55:30,263 --> 00:55:35,483
MATT: As you throw it, the arc just misses the bottom,
what's the maximum range on the dagger, right?

814
00:55:35,483 --> 00:55:39,429
LIAM: Whoa, I'm asking if instead of throwing a
dagger, can I hide instead?

815
00:55:39,429 --> 00:55:40,625
MATT: You could, yeah.

816
00:55:40,625 --> 00:55:42,960
LIAM: Yeah, I'm going to do that. I'm going to do
that.

817
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:47,175
MATT: Yeah, because right now, it's at 60 feet
away, but it's at an upward angle from you, which

818
00:55:47,175 --> 00:55:50,116
adds a little more distance, your dagger would
miss it at this range, and you would know that.

819
00:55:50,116 --> 00:55:54,512
LIAM: So I'm running balls-out to that tree, and
I'm going to go right up against the tree. And

820
00:55:54,512 --> 00:55:56,881
fucking wait and that's it.

821
00:55:56,881 --> 00:55:58,668
MATT: Cool. All right, did you roll stealth?

822
00:55:58,668 --> 00:56:07,626
LIAM: Oh, sure. I'm going to use Luck, I still
have a little Luck today, good, that's better. 31.

823
00:56:07,626 --> 00:56:15,229
MATT: 31. Good, good, good-- Okay, that ends your
turn. Keyleth, you're up.

824
00:56:15,229 --> 00:56:25,326
MARISHA: Oh god. Okay, I'm afraid of everything--
I'm afraid if I throw up a Wall of Stone or

825
00:56:25,326 --> 00:56:29,211
anything like that, he'll be able to be like, oh,
I'm a fucking dragon, so I'll go to the other side

826
00:56:29,211 --> 00:56:37,616
of the wall. Here's what I'm going to do: I'm
going to start running towards the keep. Start

827
00:56:37,616 --> 00:56:45,915
running towards the keep. I'm going to go ahead
and cast Conjure Woodland Beings. And I'm going to

828
00:56:45,915 --> 00:56:47,597
summon a giant eagle.

829
00:56:47,597 --> 00:56:51,022
TALIESIN: Yeah!

830
00:56:51,022 --> 00:57:00,294
MARISHA: This is dropping my Fog Cloud, since
that was real fucking useful.

831
00:57:00,294 --> 00:57:04,563
MATT: So, where are you conjuring it?

832
00:57:04,563 --> 00:57:15,589
MARISHA: I'm gonna conjure it right on the other
side of him where it's-- I can then have it do an

833
00:57:15,589 --> 00:57:18,420
attack, correct? In the same turn?

834
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:20,595
MATT: Yeah.

835
00:57:20,595 --> 00:57:24,193
MARISHA: I command it to go for its eyeballs.

836
00:57:24,193 --> 00:57:25,979
LIAM: Eagle to the fucking face.

837
00:57:25,979 --> 00:57:27,102
TALIESIN: Eagle to the eye!

838
00:57:27,102 --> 00:57:28,981
MATT: Okay.

839
00:57:28,981 --> 00:57:31,983
LIAM: Oh, that's inauspicious.

840
00:57:31,983 --> 00:57:36,084
MATT: All right, so as the eagle goes up. Do you
have stats for the eagle?

841
00:57:36,084 --> 00:57:41,742
LAURA: That eagle is weally weally close to that
dwagon.

842
00:57:41,742 --> 00:57:47,297
MARISHA: Oh right, he's attacking, right, right.
He has talons.

843
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:49,787
MATT: You've got to roll for damage on that.

844
00:57:49,787 --> 00:57:53,325
MARISHA: That was more of a distraction.

845
00:57:53,325 --> 00:57:55,707
MATT: Which spell is this? Conjure--

846
00:57:55,707 --> 00:57:57,998
MARISHA: Conjure Woodland Beings.

847
00:57:57,998 --> 00:58:00,909
MATT: Conjure Woodland Beings.

848
00:58:00,909 --> 00:58:02,713
MARISHA: It's a 4th-level spell.

849
00:58:02,713 --> 00:58:08,001
MATT: 4th-level spell, thank you. All right,
great.

850
00:58:08,001 --> 00:58:13,074
MARISHA: It was a 19-- Oh wait, plus five is 21.

851
00:58:13,074 --> 00:58:17,250
MATT: I have to roll initiative for it separately
as part of the spell. It rolled a 20.

852
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:19,084
MARISHA: It rolled a 20?

853
00:58:19,084 --> 00:58:24,354
MATT: All right, so I'll say given that case I'll let
it go ahead and go immediately, but next turn it

854
00:58:24,354 --> 00:58:25,585
starts at 20.

855
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:26,775
MARISHA: Okay.

856
00:58:26,775 --> 00:58:28,686
MATT: That is pretty close to what you got.

857
00:58:28,686 --> 00:58:30,643
MARISHA: It rolled a 21 on its attack.

858
00:58:30,643 --> 00:58:32,070
MATT: 21? Hits! Actually.

859
00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:33,810
(cheering)

860
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:37,246
MARISHA: Go, eagle, go! Right in the eyes.

861
00:58:37,246 --> 00:58:40,013
TRAVIS: Just barely hits or hits?

862
00:58:40,013 --> 00:58:43,108
MATT: It's close to barely hitting him.

863
00:58:43,108 --> 00:58:51,146
MARISHA: Yeah! 2d-- So that's 11 plus three-- 14
points of damage.

864
00:58:51,146 --> 00:58:57,780
MATT: 14 points of damage. As the eagle starts
clawing at it, you can see the dragon rears back,

865
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:02,889
unexpected to see the sudden giant eagle appear
out of the middle of the air and go clawing at its

866
00:59:02,889 --> 00:59:07,772
face. You can see it rears back as it does so,
moving its head out of the way. Gets a couple of

867
00:59:07,772 --> 00:59:12,341
scratches in, but still an ancient dragon. It's
more spooked than really hurting from the

868
00:59:12,341 --> 00:59:15,205
impact, but it caught it off guard.

869
00:59:15,205 --> 00:59:18,430
MARISHA: It's supposed to be a distraction, all
right-- And then I use a bonus action to be like:

870
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:20,008
everyone inside!

871
00:59:20,008 --> 00:59:24,608
MATT: All right, that's your turn? Now it is the
white dragon's turn. Let's see if its breath

872
00:59:24,608 --> 00:59:33,903
weapon returns. Nope, it rolled a one. So instead,
it's going to ignore the eagle.

873
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:35,141
MARISHA: Great.

874
00:59:35,141 --> 00:59:44,358
MATT: As instead it lands right about there.

875
00:59:44,358 --> 00:59:47,094
TRAVIS: It lands?

876
00:59:47,094 --> 00:59:52,448
MATT: It lands (impact). As it impacts, the whole
ground shakes around you. As you were

877
00:59:52,448 --> 00:59:58,286
pushing Trinket, you look over your shoulders, the
shadow encompasses the area, and as you look over,

878
00:59:58,286 --> 01:00:03,957
you see it land with a heavy impact. Giant frozen
gnashing teeth as mist emanates from the side of

879
01:00:03,957 --> 01:00:08,439
its jaws. It's going to use its multiattack,
including its Frightful Presence. I need

880
01:00:08,439 --> 01:00:12,556
everybody, <i>everybody</i> to roll a wisdom saving
throw.

881
01:00:12,556 --> 01:00:15,188
TALIESIN: Including us inside?

882
01:00:15,188 --> 01:00:23,619
MATT: Yep. As it rears back and gives off a
horrible roar that shakes the stones of the actual keep.

883
01:00:23,619 --> 01:00:25,439
MARISHA: 23.

884
01:00:25,439 --> 01:00:26,476
MATT: Okay.

885
01:00:26,476 --> 01:00:27,822
LIAM: 18.

886
01:00:27,822 --> 01:00:28,911
TRAVIS: 18.

887
01:00:28,911 --> 01:00:30,303
TALIESIN: Seven.

888
01:00:30,303 --> 01:00:32,464
LAURA: Eight for me.

889
01:00:32,464 --> 01:00:34,901
MATT: Oh, Scanlan rolled a 19.

890
01:00:34,901 --> 01:00:38,012
LAURA: And 19 for Trinket.

891
01:00:38,012 --> 01:00:40,742
TALIESIN: Actually, I'm going to spend my resolve
and reroll that.

892
01:00:40,742 --> 01:00:42,450
MATT: Okay, go for it.

893
01:00:42,450 --> 01:00:44,740
TALIESIN: Ten.

894
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:55,047
MATT: Okay, everyone who rolled an 18 or lower, it
shakes you to your core. You suddenly really

895
01:00:55,047 --> 01:01:01,583
realize what you are dealing with here and the
fear causes you to fight with the fight or flight

896
01:01:01,583 --> 01:01:04,169
impulse in your body. You are considered
frightened.

897
01:01:04,169 --> 01:01:06,397
LIAM: Too late for Luck? (laughs) I got one more
charge.

898
01:01:06,397 --> 01:01:07,666
TRAVIS: I can't be charmed or frightened.

899
01:01:07,666 --> 01:01:10,569
MATT: Yeah, you're still raging so it doesn't
affect you.

900
01:01:10,569 --> 01:01:12,647
LIAM: Nope, nope.

901
01:01:12,647 --> 01:01:18,987
MATT: Nope. Okay. While you are frightened, you
have disadvantage on ability checks and attack

902
01:01:18,987 --> 01:01:21,028
rolls while it's in your line of sight.

903
01:01:21,028 --> 01:01:23,287
LAURA: Man, I wish we would've a Fancy Feast.

904
01:01:23,287 --> 01:01:26,600
MATT: And you cannot move closer to it willingly.
You can only move away from it.

905
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,714
LIAM: So attack rolls and what was the other?

906
01:01:28,714 --> 01:01:32,217
MATT: Ability checks. While you can see it. You're
so scared of this thing.

907
01:01:32,217 --> 01:01:33,638
LAURA: What is it really called?

908
01:01:33,638 --> 01:01:34,850
MARISHA: Heroes' Feast.

909
01:01:34,850 --> 01:01:36,717
LAURA: Fancy Feast is way better.

910
01:01:36,717 --> 01:01:38,208
MATT: Lower level, but helpful.

911
01:01:38,208 --> 01:01:42,808
LIAM: (singing) I like chicken, I like liver, Meow
Mix, Meow Mix, please deliver.

912
01:01:42,808 --> 01:01:45,531
TRAVIS: In the middle of white death.

913
01:01:45,531 --> 01:01:53,743
MATT: It's going to make a bite attack against
Pike and two claw attacks against Grog, who are

914
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:59,642
right there. So Pike, you look up as its jaws come
down at you from above. That's a natural 20.

915
01:01:59,642 --> 01:02:03,044
TRAVIS: Oh fuck, shit.

916
01:02:03,044 --> 01:02:08,214
MATT: Against you, Grog, two claw attacks, that is
23.

917
01:02:08,214 --> 01:02:09,450
TRAVIS: Come on, taint-smear.

918
01:02:09,450 --> 01:02:11,631
MATT: And 22.

919
01:02:11,631 --> 01:02:13,020
TRAVIS: Tickles, both of them.

920
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:18,314
MATT: Okay, so against you, Grog, you take--

921
01:02:18,314 --> 01:02:19,925
LAURA: Wait, that was against Grog?

922
01:02:19,925 --> 01:02:28,034
MATT: The bite was against Pike. Two claws against
you. So Grog, you take 15 points of slashing

923
01:02:28,034 --> 01:02:34,328
damage, reduced to half because you are raging.
So, eight. And the other claw, that's a little

924
01:02:34,328 --> 01:02:40,602
higher, that is going to be 18 points of slashing
damage. So down to nine.

925
01:02:40,602 --> 01:02:44,445
LAURA: So wait, so Pike was the one that took
those huge hits?

926
01:02:44,445 --> 01:02:46,417
MATT: The critical bite.

927
01:02:46,417 --> 01:02:48,842
LAURA: (gasps) Are you okay, Pike?

928
01:02:48,842 --> 01:02:52,586
ASHLEY: I don't know. (singing) Critical bite!

929
01:02:52,586 --> 01:02:54,745
LIAM: What's Pike's AC? What's Pike's AC?

930
01:02:54,745 --> 01:03:01,576
MATT: 20, but it rolled a critical hit. So
that's--

931
01:03:01,576 --> 01:03:04,415
LIAM: Ooh, what's that face?

932
01:03:04,415 --> 01:03:06,900
TALIESIN: Don't do that!

933
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:16,262
MATT: So 17 times two. 34 plus eight. 42 points of
piercing damage.

934
01:03:16,262 --> 01:03:18,294
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.

935
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:23,830
MATT: However, you then also suffer, as the
freezing jaws clench around you and the cold

936
01:03:23,830 --> 01:03:30,403
surrounds you, you suffer an additional, that was
42 right?

937
01:03:30,403 --> 01:03:33,071
LIAM: I think you just said 'two', you just said
'two.'

938
01:03:33,071 --> 01:03:38,961
MATT: Nah. Nine plus-- 13 points of cold damage.
So 55 points of damage total.

939
01:03:38,961 --> 01:03:41,528
TRAVIS: Where you at, Pike?

940
01:03:41,528 --> 01:03:42,981
LAURA: Are you okay?

941
01:03:42,981 --> 01:03:45,493
ASHLEY: I am at, hold on--

942
01:03:45,493 --> 01:03:48,012
LIAM: Carry the one. Carry the three.

943
01:03:48,012 --> 01:03:49,456
ASHLEY: Hold on, one second.

944
01:03:49,456 --> 01:03:50,607
MATT: Doing math here.

945
01:03:50,607 --> 01:03:52,086
LAURA: "One second, let me check."

946
01:03:52,086 --> 01:03:57,296
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm at 25. Could be worse, could be
worse.

947
01:03:57,296 --> 01:03:58,897
MATT: That ends its turn.

948
01:03:58,897 --> 01:04:00,944
TRAVIS: Are we really fighting this thing or are
we running?

949
01:04:00,944 --> 01:04:02,824
MARISHA: That what I was about to ask. Are we
fighting or are we running?

950
01:04:02,824 --> 01:04:04,832
TRAVIS: We are getting our fucking asses handed to
us.

951
01:04:04,832 --> 01:04:06,056
LAURA: Is it ancient?

952
01:04:06,056 --> 01:04:08,950
TRAVIS: He keeps saying ancient. So it's ancient.

953
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:12,592
MATT: That brings us to Vex's turn.

954
01:04:12,592 --> 01:04:14,576
LAURA: My turn? I'm feared.

955
01:04:14,576 --> 01:04:19,314
MATT: Yeah, so you can attack it but you can't
move closer to it and have disadvantage on all

956
01:04:19,314 --> 01:04:20,327
your attacks.

957
01:04:20,327 --> 01:04:21,994
TALIESIN: What can we do to unfear?

958
01:04:21,994 --> 01:04:27,183
MATT: You repeat the saving throw at the end of
each of your turns. Or it lasts for a minute.

959
01:04:27,183 --> 01:04:29,944
LAURA: Okay, then I'm going to use my bonus round
to hide. Stealth.

960
01:04:29,944 --> 01:04:32,359
MATT: Okay, so go ahead and roll a stealth check.

961
01:04:32,359 --> 01:04:41,547
LAURA: 23. We're stuck where we are because we
can't run closer to it.

962
01:04:41,547 --> 01:04:42,984
TRAVIS: You can run away from it.

963
01:04:42,984 --> 01:04:44,584
MATT: You have disadvantage on the stealth check,
by the way.

964
01:04:44,584 --> 01:04:45,872
LAURA: I did, and it was 23.

965
01:04:45,872 --> 01:04:47,007
MATT: 23, gotcha.

966
01:04:47,007 --> 01:04:48,198
MARISHA: Who's not feared?

967
01:04:48,198 --> 01:04:50,555
LAURA: Oh! It's disadvantage, but I had
advantage.

968
01:04:50,555 --> 01:04:52,392
MATT: So it's just a straight roll.

969
01:04:52,392 --> 01:04:54,199
LAURA: Even. I don't remember what the first--

970
01:04:54,199 --> 01:04:56,888
LIAM: I wasn't paying attention.

971
01:04:56,888 --> 01:04:58,391
LAURA: Should I reroll it?

972
01:04:58,391 --> 01:05:03,711
MATT: We'll take the 23, it's fine. Okay. You're
inside and you know it's outside and you heard the

973
01:05:03,711 --> 01:05:07,657
roar and shaking and so you can peek around the
corner but you cannot move out of the building.

974
01:05:07,657 --> 01:05:12,436
You can basically strafe to the side to get a look
out as you want to, if you want to fire on it.

975
01:05:12,436 --> 01:05:14,173
LAURA: Okay, I guess I'll try to shoot it, then.

976
01:05:14,173 --> 01:05:16,560
MATT: Okay, go for it. So disadvantage on both
your attacks.

977
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:18,094
LAURA: Okay.

978
01:05:18,094 --> 01:05:22,390
MATT: Trinket shrugged it off, Trinket is like,
"Whatever, I got this."

979
01:05:22,390 --> 01:05:28,776
LAURA: Oh okay so-- That was good, that was good,
26. With disadvantage. Okay, so I'll do

980
01:05:28,776 --> 01:05:31,462
the first one right now.

981
01:05:31,462 --> 01:05:34,329
MARISHA: If we're running, I don't want to
bust out my good shit.

982
01:05:34,329 --> 01:05:36,781
TRAVIS: We've got to run, right? I think it's stupid
if we stay.

983
01:05:36,781 --> 01:05:40,888
LIAM: But where do we go? If we're outdoors, we're
dead.

984
01:05:40,888 --> 01:05:43,462
MARISHA: We can go down-- inside, anyways.

985
01:05:43,462 --> 01:05:44,854
LIAM: And go where?

986
01:05:44,854 --> 01:05:46,426
TRAVIS: I don't know where, can he get inside the
keep?

987
01:05:46,426 --> 01:05:47,588
LIAM: Sure, he can dig--

988
01:05:47,588 --> 01:05:48,457
LAURA: 22.

989
01:05:48,457 --> 01:05:49,580
MATT: 22 hits.

990
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:51,684
LAURA: Because I got Sneak Attack, right, because
I'm hiding?

991
01:05:51,684 --> 01:05:54,717
MATT: Yes, because you are technically hiding and
it didn't roll high enough perception.

992
01:05:54,717 --> 01:05:56,917
LAURA: Okay, so 23 was the damage on the first
arrow.

993
01:05:56,917 --> 01:05:59,160
MATT: All right, was that including the sneak
attack d6?

994
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:04,481
LIAM: I don't know where to go. We can't go above
ground because we're dead.

995
01:06:04,481 --> 01:06:06,651
LAURA: Now, the second one I don't think hits, it
was like an 18.

996
01:06:06,651 --> 01:06:14,503
MATT: Nope, that misses. So the first one, you
fire and it manages to hit the creature because it

997
01:06:14,503 --> 01:06:19,304
does not see you. It hits to the side of its neck
and looks over. It goes--

998
01:06:19,304 --> 01:06:20,957
LAURA: I duck back behind the wall.

999
01:06:20,957 --> 01:06:24,803
MATT: Okay, behind the wall. You do reveal
yourself as part of the strike, and it does see you

1000
01:06:24,803 --> 01:06:26,297
duck inside and growls.

1001
01:06:26,297 --> 01:06:29,770
LAURA: Okay, and I want to send Trinket into the
keep, if he can make it.

1002
01:06:29,770 --> 01:06:32,720
MATT: Trinket is going to rush this way.

1003
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,443
LAURA: Is that, should I send Trinket into the
keep?

1004
01:06:34,443 --> 01:06:35,530
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1005
01:06:35,530 --> 01:06:37,581
MATT: It gets an attack of opportunity against
Trinket.

1006
01:06:37,581 --> 01:06:39,720
LAURA: Balls, what? Really?

1007
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:41,746
TALIESIN: But it's holding Pike, so it has no
bite.

1008
01:06:41,746 --> 01:06:46,675
MATT: Well, no, it didn't grapple her, it just bit
her and released. She managed to get her way out

1009
01:06:46,675 --> 01:06:52,056
of its mouth. That's going to be a 26 to hit.

1010
01:06:52,056 --> 01:06:54,416
LAURA: Ah Jesus, it hits, come on.

1011
01:06:54,416 --> 01:07:00,043
MATT: All right, so Trinket takes 14 points of
slashing damage.

1012
01:07:00,043 --> 01:07:01,239
LAURA: All right.

1013
01:07:01,239 --> 01:07:02,379
TRAVIS: Is he good?

1014
01:07:02,379 --> 01:07:04,564
LAURA: He's fine. Bear-ly.

1015
01:07:04,564 --> 01:07:08,241
MATT: Oh, what! I see what you did. Does that end
your turn?

1016
01:07:08,241 --> 01:07:09,529
LAURA: Yeah.

1017
01:07:09,609 --> 01:07:11,410
TALIESIN: Did you do a saving throw?

1018
01:07:11,410 --> 01:07:13,352
MATT: Do your saving throw, to see if you shrug
off the frightened ability.

1019
01:07:13,352 --> 01:07:14,891
LAURA: Okay, so is it wisdom?

1020
01:07:14,891 --> 01:07:18,652
MATT: It's wisdom-based, yeah.

1021
01:07:18,652 --> 01:07:21,298
LAURA: Ooh, 17, 18, 19!

1022
01:07:21,298 --> 01:07:24,527
MATT: 19 is just what you need, you managed to
shake off the fright from this. Seeing Trinket rush

1023
01:07:24,527 --> 01:07:30,202
off, you're like, "Okay, I can do this." At the
end of your turn, the white dragon is going to use--

1024
01:07:30,202 --> 01:07:33,485
LAURA: I'm not afraid anymore, you hear that?

1025
01:07:33,485 --> 01:07:41,019
MATT: It's going to go ahead and use two of its
actions to do a wing attack.

1026
01:07:41,019 --> 01:07:42,169
LIAM: Shit.

1027
01:07:42,169 --> 01:07:49,228
MATT: So every creature within 15 feet of it, as
it's sitting there, beats its wings around it and

1028
01:07:49,228 --> 01:07:54,199
kicks up all this cold wind and air that blasts
out, threatening to knock you off your feet. This

1029
01:07:54,199 --> 01:08:01,923
is going to affect Grog, Pike, and Shayne. So I
need you guys to make a dexterity saving throw.

1030
01:08:01,923 --> 01:08:03,985
LAURA: Pike, get out of there!

1031
01:08:03,985 --> 01:08:05,421
MATT: Dexterity saving throw.

1032
01:08:05,421 --> 01:08:07,113
ASHLEY: I'm trying, I'm trying.

1033
01:08:07,113 --> 01:08:11,459
TRAVIS: I have advantage on those. Because of
Danger Sense.

1034
01:08:11,459 --> 01:08:15,625
ASHLEY: Ah! Natural 20.

1035
01:08:15,625 --> 01:08:16,762
TRAVIS: Natural 20!

1036
01:08:16,762 --> 01:08:18,529
(cheering)

1037
01:08:18,529 --> 01:08:23,201
ASHLEY: I don't have any dexterity modifier.

1038
01:08:23,201 --> 01:08:33,885
MATT: Cool. So-- All right, so yeah. I'll see if
Shayne-- Shayne does not make it with a two, so

1039
01:08:33,885 --> 01:08:39,205
Shayne takes 15 points of bludgeoning damage and
is knocked prone. As she is rushing up, she's

1040
01:08:39,205 --> 01:08:45,027
dropped her heavy crossbow and she's pulling a
weapon out, and she rushes up, yelling, her red hair

1041
01:08:45,027 --> 01:08:50,005
blown back from the wind as it's beating towards
her. She gets bludgeoned with the sheer force of

1042
01:08:50,005 --> 01:08:54,188
the wind from under the wings and knocked flat on
her back. At the end of that attack, it now gets

1043
01:08:54,188 --> 01:09:10,150
to move half its movement and so it-- There we go,
a fly speed of 80, it's going to move 40 feet. So

1044
01:09:10,150 --> 01:09:18,847
that will put it at 20 up this way as it starts
backing away. And it's going to move 20 feet in

1045
01:09:18,847 --> 01:09:19,826
this direction.

1046
01:09:19,826 --> 01:09:21,476
TRAVIS: I get an attack of opportunity on it,
right?

1047
01:09:21,476 --> 01:09:24,227
MATT: As it pulls away from you, yes you do.

1048
01:09:24,227 --> 01:09:26,504
LAURA: Pike gets one, too.

1049
01:09:26,504 --> 01:09:31,174
MATT: No, actually, neither of you-- no, Grog is
the only that does, because Pike, you're too far

1050
01:09:31,174 --> 01:09:34,341
away, and it has reach on its attacks, so it
doesn't have to be right up against you to hit you.

1051
01:09:34,341 --> 01:09:37,181
But you still have to be up against it to get an
attack.

1052
01:09:37,181 --> 01:09:42,025
TRAVIS: 22. Does that hit?

1053
01:09:42,025 --> 01:09:43,340
MATT: That hits, yeah.

1054
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:46,996
TRAVIS: Okay. This is with Craven Edge, five,
six.

1055
01:09:46,996 --> 01:09:50,066
LAURA: Kill him. Kill him with Craven Edge!

1056
01:09:50,066 --> 01:09:52,504
TRAVIS: 19 points of damage.

1057
01:09:52,504 --> 01:09:55,501
MATT: 19 points of damage, got it. All right, and
has to make its constitution save

1058
01:09:55,501 --> 01:09:58,043
LAURA: Disadvantage.

1059
01:09:58,043 --> 01:10:06,714
MATT: Not on saving throws. 24. Resist it? All
right, cool.

1060
01:10:06,714 --> 01:10:08,506
TRAVIS: You fucking piece of shit.

1061
01:10:08,506 --> 01:10:15,406
MATT: (laughs) So that ends Vex's turn, the guards
now. Shayne will get up and she's now going to regret

1062
01:10:15,406 --> 01:10:18,531
dropping her crossbow and go over and pick it up
again; she's not going to have time to fire it.

1063
01:10:18,621 --> 01:10:26,951
The other two, down here, are going to be--
Cordell is going to turn around and fire off a

1064
01:10:26,951 --> 01:10:37,348
shot, as well as Kendrick. That's a natural one.
That does hit, that does not, and that does not.

1065
01:10:37,348 --> 01:10:44,459
One hit gets through, rolling ones like crap.
That's five points of piercing damage, not great

1066
01:10:44,459 --> 01:10:49,688
on that round, guards. Then they're going to
start rushing towards the keep here, using the

1067
01:10:49,688 --> 01:10:52,786
rest of their movement. Cordell is going to start
moving to the side and start ushering everybody

1068
01:10:52,786 --> 01:10:59,046
inside. "Go in, go in, go in." Shayne is going to
move up next to you, Grog, and essentially begin

1069
01:10:59,046 --> 01:11:04,966
to hold the flank with you. Shoulder to shoulder,
she, as opposed to the crossbow at this point, and

1070
01:11:04,966 --> 01:11:11,287
seeing the two of you can work together in this
regard, she pulls out a broadsword. That's going

1071
01:11:11,287 --> 01:11:14,847
to end the guards' turn, Grog, you're up.

1072
01:11:14,847 --> 01:11:19,781
TRAVIS: Fuck this dragon. As much as I would love
to protect this house, we've got to get the fuck

1073
01:11:19,781 --> 01:11:23,738
out of here. Is Pike right behind me?

1074
01:11:23,738 --> 01:11:25,808
MATT: Pike is, yes.

1075
01:11:25,808 --> 01:11:30,318
TRAVIS: Can I grab her and run inside the keep?

1076
01:11:30,318 --> 01:11:34,490
MATT: If Pike will allow it. Are you going to let
Grog do that or are you going to fight him on it?

1077
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:36,424
ASHLEY: No, no, no.

1078
01:11:36,424 --> 01:11:38,861
TRAVIS: No, no, no, I can't do it?

1079
01:11:38,861 --> 01:11:41,554
ASHLEY: No, no, no, grab me and let's go.

1080
01:11:41,554 --> 01:11:46,887
MATT: You reach over and grab Pike, lift her up,
and the two of you go bolting towards the keep.

1081
01:11:46,887 --> 01:11:49,089
ASHLEY: Grog!

1082
01:11:49,089 --> 01:11:51,686
MATT: That'll get you right here in the crowd.

1083
01:11:51,686 --> 01:11:54,090
LAURA: Oh jeez, don't attack the crowd.

1084
01:11:54,090 --> 01:11:55,920
TRAVIS: 50 feet?

1085
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:59,995
MATT: 50 feet, but you're also having to push through
people, so you're getting up, we'll say--

1086
01:11:59,995 --> 01:12:01,900
TRAVIS: Little meat sticks, it's not a problem.

1087
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:04,976
MATT: We'll say as you're pushing through here,
you get up to the door. You guys are right up

1088
01:12:04,976 --> 01:12:06,355
there with the full movement.

1089
01:12:06,355 --> 01:12:07,931
TRAVIS: I'll even damage them, I don't give a
shit.

1090
01:12:07,931 --> 01:12:10,931
MATT: There you go, that's your turn. The action
was to pick her up. Okay.

1091
01:12:10,931 --> 01:12:13,948
TRAVIS: Get out of the way, giant beast coming
through.

1092
01:12:13,948 --> 01:12:17,810
MATT: Scanlan, at the back, seeing you guys
rushing in, and he's happy to see Pike coming into

1093
01:12:17,855 --> 01:12:21,819
safety at this point. He pulls out his wand again
and aims once more with the Fireball.

1094
01:12:21,819 --> 01:12:24,101
TRAVIS: The dragon giggles.

1095
01:12:24,101 --> 01:12:25,950
MARISHA: Tickles.

1096
01:12:25,950 --> 01:12:32,391
TALIESIN: Technically, fire damage should be
good.

1097
01:12:32,391 --> 01:12:35,297
MATT: Fire damage doesn't do anything additional
to it.

1098
01:12:35,297 --> 01:12:42,002
TRAVIS: Don't say it smug like that. Jeez. It's
our lives!

1099
01:12:42,002 --> 01:12:50,074
MATT: 29 damage, makes the save, so 15 points of
fire damage to it as it blasts from underneath,

1100
01:12:50,074 --> 01:12:57,401
singes the edge of one of the trees, but the white
dragon appears to still be not really visibly

1101
01:12:57,401 --> 01:12:59,236
hurting yet.

1102
01:12:59,236 --> 01:13:01,395
TRAVIS: Yep, got to go. Got to go. Got to go.

1103
01:13:01,395 --> 01:13:14,588
MATT: Scanlan backs up into the keep, at this
realization. At that point, nothing is right in

1104
01:13:14,588 --> 01:13:20,487
range. So yeah, so the white dragon is not going
to do anything. At this point in time--

1105
01:13:20,487 --> 01:13:22,082
TRAVIS: Nope.

1106
01:13:22,082 --> 01:13:32,961
MATT: You guys hear a voice come ringing out from
the north side, towards where Emon is. A familiar

1107
01:13:32,961 --> 01:13:41,865
voice that you've heard before that shouts out,
"Enough! You are not to linger, follow the others."

1108
01:13:41,865 --> 01:13:50,637
At which point, you see the white dragon
glances over the shoulder, and you hear the voice

1109
01:13:50,637 --> 01:13:59,592
again say, "Vorugal!" And a streak of smoke and
red. The red dragon you saw that had perched

1110
01:13:59,592 --> 01:14:09,261
itself in the center of the city grapples onto the
back of Vorugal and throws the dragon off the edge

1111
01:14:09,261 --> 01:14:15,790
of the wall. And goes tumbling to the south of the
keep. Out from the perspective.

1112
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:19,007
LAURA: So how much bigger is Vorugal, like is
he--?

1113
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:22,380
MATT: Yeah, he's roughly double the size of the
white dragon.

1114
01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:25,815
LAURA: Holy crap!

1115
01:14:25,815 --> 01:14:28,836
MARISHA: Is this Umbrasyl? Does he refer himself
as Umbrasyl?

1116
01:14:28,836 --> 01:14:31,586
MATT: No, you haven't heard the name of this one,
until that point. Well, I mentioned it earlier.

1117
01:14:31,586 --> 01:14:32,987
MARISHA: No, the red dragon.

1118
01:14:32,987 --> 01:14:38,507
MATT: The red dragon you haven't heard the name of
yet. Umbrasyl is the black dragon. Raishan was the

1119
01:14:38,507 --> 01:14:47,627
green dragon. So as you hear the impact, you hear
the dragon screeching out in anger and no one has

1120
01:14:47,627 --> 01:14:52,023
any visual at this point, you just hear the sounds
over the side. You hear it skid to a halt, but the

1121
01:14:52,023 --> 01:14:57,706
red dragon is still flying and grabs it, throws
it, makes it hit the ground, almost like a show of

1122
01:14:57,706 --> 01:15:05,183
dominance. And as it arcs back around, it ignores
the keep and heads back towards Emon. You see

1123
01:15:05,183 --> 01:15:11,702
Vorugal now lifting back up into the sky, staring
back at the red dragon as it heads back, and you

1124
01:15:11,702 --> 01:15:18,488
can see in its general demeanor, it's frustrated and
angry and it begrudgingly begins to fly towards

1125
01:15:18,488 --> 01:15:25,127
the east, where you saw the other two dragons
continue. As the red dragon returns towards the

1126
01:15:25,127 --> 01:15:31,995
city, its voice is ringing out at a volume that,
even at this distance, is being enhanced by some

1127
01:15:31,995 --> 01:15:36,939
sort of arcane means, whether it means-- it wants
to be heard. And as you can see now, as it hits

1128
01:15:36,939 --> 01:15:48,329
over the far south walls of Emon, it shouts out
once more, "Hear me, insects! You that live do so

1129
01:15:48,329 --> 01:16:00,364
"out of mercy. Fight or flee and you forfeit that
mercy. Know that your pitiful guardians brought

1130
01:16:00,364 --> 01:16:14,824
"this upon you. That blood is on <i>their</i> hands!
Vengeance has been swift, and in its wake, a new

1131
01:16:14,824 --> 01:16:24,595
"age is upon you." Making its way towards the
center of the city. "Be thankful, for until now

1132
01:16:24,595 --> 01:16:39,492
"your lives had no purpose. No meaning. Abandon
your gods, your paltry convictions, for now you

1133
01:16:39,492 --> 01:16:49,134
"have a new purpose: to serve me!" And with that,
you hear the clattering impact once more of the

1134
01:16:49,134 --> 01:16:55,648
Cloudtop District, as a half-dozen buildings
collapse under its weight as it slams into the

1135
01:16:55,648 --> 01:17:00,294
center of what probably still stood tall in the
middle of the city of Emon. You hear the crumbling

1136
01:17:00,294 --> 01:17:05,880
wreckage echoing in the distance as it slides to a
halt. And a couple of distant slamming sounds as

1137
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:13,352
it makes its way into the central borough where
the palace once was. Quiet now takes the air, as

1138
01:17:13,352 --> 01:17:18,817
all the people are still standing frozen in fright
of what they just saw, and slowly begin making

1139
01:17:18,817 --> 01:17:25,732
their way into the keep, whispering, shaking,
crying under their breaths, the survivors that are

1140
01:17:25,732 --> 01:17:35,648
not frozen in the center of Greyskull Keep's
courtyard. What do you want to do?

1141
01:17:35,648 --> 01:17:36,856
TRAVIS: Pee.

1142
01:17:36,856 --> 01:17:37,998
(laughter)

1143
01:17:37,998 --> 01:17:42,494
MATT: That is entirely viable.

1144
01:17:42,494 --> 01:17:45,472
LIAM: Everyone, we need to go inside.

1145
01:17:45,472 --> 01:17:46,720
TALIESIN: Yes.

1146
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:48,568
MARISHA: Is this because of us?

1147
01:17:48,568 --> 01:17:55,844
LAURA: Can we heal the frozen people? Is it
possible?

1148
01:17:55,886 --> 01:18:02,062
MATT: You guys make you way out towards the people
currently frozen in the courtyard-- What? Did you

1149
01:18:02,062 --> 01:18:03,769
want to use Cure Wounds?

1150
01:18:03,769 --> 01:18:05,805
LAURA: Yeah, sure.

1151
01:18:05,805 --> 01:18:09,787
MATT: Okay. You use what level?

1152
01:18:09,787 --> 01:18:11,092
LAURA: Two.

1153
01:18:11,092 --> 01:18:11,845
MATT: Two, all right.

1154
01:18:11,845 --> 01:18:13,201
LIAM: How many people are frozen?

1155
01:18:13,201 --> 01:18:16,162
MATT: Currently, I'd say about 14 people are
frozen in the courtyard.

1156
01:18:16,162 --> 01:18:17,916
LIAM: Can we all do medicine checks on them?

1157
01:18:17,916 --> 01:18:23,493
MATT: Six of them are partially shattered, like as
part of the impact their bodies (shattering ice)

1158
01:18:23,493 --> 01:18:29,339
and part of the torso busted, arms missing, upper
body's missing. As you cast your 2nd-level Cure

1159
01:18:29,339 --> 01:18:34,167
Wounds spell and reach out and touch the person to
heal them, a crack forms where your hand touched

1160
01:18:34,167 --> 01:18:41,719
the body and (shattering ice) before the upper
part of their torso, head, and leg breaks into

1161
01:18:41,719 --> 01:18:46,581
ice, and you get the feeling looking around that
these individuals are beyond saving at this point.

1162
01:18:46,581 --> 01:18:47,976
MARISHA: It's too long, it's too late.

1163
01:18:47,976 --> 01:18:50,718
LIAM: Inside, everyone inside now.

1164
01:18:50,718 --> 01:18:51,755
TRAVIS: Yeah, we all go inside.

1165
01:18:51,755 --> 01:18:52,897
LIAM: Come along.

1166
01:18:52,897 --> 01:19:01,331
MATT: All right, so. You guys make your way inside
the keep. People are looking about, some people

1167
01:19:01,331 --> 01:19:08,422
are running through rooms trying to find a place
to keep safe. You can see already in the armory

1168
01:19:08,422 --> 01:19:13,644
there's like a family in there that are huddling,
crouched in the corner. Some people have moved on

1169
01:19:13,644 --> 01:19:19,119
towards the kitchen, people are shouting trying to
see if anybody they lost eye contact with is

1170
01:19:19,119 --> 01:19:24,899
inside, you hear a couple of people shouting
names. "Shawn! Shawn!" "Kayla!" Different names

1171
01:19:24,899 --> 01:19:30,083
being shouted as if they're hoping that someone
they got separated from may have made it in.

1172
01:19:30,083 --> 01:19:36,983
Couple do, a few seem to continue to shout
fruitlessly. But the inside energy of the keep is

1173
01:19:36,983 --> 01:19:43,664
one of tension, fear, and mounting sadness.

1174
01:19:43,664 --> 01:19:47,411
LAURA: Can I find Erwen?

1175
01:19:47,411 --> 01:19:50,458
MATT: You can, you told the people within the keep
to go downstairs

1176
01:19:50,458 --> 01:19:56,822
LAURA: Yeah, I go and find him and tell him to
start setting up as many beds as he can, as many

1177
01:19:56,822 --> 01:20:04,082
in the cathedral that we have to-- In the chapel.
To maybe give some of these people places to stay

1178
01:20:04,082 --> 01:20:05,088
for the time being.

1179
01:20:05,088 --> 01:20:06,208
MATT: All right, so.

1180
01:20:06,208 --> 01:20:08,131
ASHLEY: Can I go into the temple?

1181
01:20:08,131 --> 01:20:13,405
MATT: You can. As you head downstairs too, you can
see Jarett is still there, sitting with his

1182
01:20:13,405 --> 01:20:20,160
crossbow on his lap, and he's been doing his last
duty, which was to watch over your workshop. And

1183
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:25,626
as you come down the stairs, he goes, "What's
going on, I heard noises upstairs, is everyone all right?"

1184
01:20:25,626 --> 01:20:26,722
TALIESIN: No.

1185
01:20:26,722 --> 01:20:30,348
LAURA: Everything's gone.

1186
01:20:32,808 --> 01:20:36,740
MATT: "May I be excused to aid Erwen in his
duty?"

1187
01:20:36,740 --> 01:20:38,077
LAURA: Please do.

1188
01:20:38,077 --> 01:20:42,199
MATT: "All right." He gets up and puts his
crossbow away, heads upstairs, finds Erwen and

1189
01:20:42,199 --> 01:20:47,291
Laina's still shaking, she goes, "If we're having
guests, should I make food? I don't know what to

1190
01:20:47,291 --> 01:20:48,455
"do, I don't know what to do."

1191
01:20:48,455 --> 01:20:53,295
LAURA: Simple food. Fruit, anything.

1192
01:20:53,295 --> 01:20:54,996
MATT: "Okay, I'll go ahead and start preparing
it."

1193
01:20:54,996 --> 01:20:59,111
TRAVIS: Percy. Can I have a word with you,
please?

1194
01:20:59,111 --> 01:21:01,211
TALIESIN: I step inside my workshop.

1195
01:21:01,211 --> 01:21:03,496
TRAVIS: May I come in?

1196
01:21:03,496 --> 01:21:04,797
TALIESIN: Yes, of course.

1197
01:21:04,797 --> 01:21:06,798
TRAVIS: Can you shut the door?

1198
01:21:06,798 --> 01:21:12,829
TALIESIN: Is there anywhere private in this place
at this point?

1199
01:21:12,829 --> 01:21:14,148
LAURA: Nobody is in the workshop yet.

1200
01:21:14,148 --> 01:21:16,692
MATT: Nobody is in the basement or workshop
area. Everyone is seemingly scattered on the

1201
01:21:16,692 --> 01:21:19,238
base floor of the keep.

1202
01:21:19,238 --> 01:21:20,749
TALIESIN: All right.

1203
01:21:20,749 --> 01:21:24,353
TRAVIS: Can you lock it?

1204
01:21:24,353 --> 01:21:26,008
TALIESIN: All right?

1205
01:21:26,008 --> 01:21:33,119
TRAVIS: Listen, the skull we took out of the
house. I haven't told you, but it grants a wish

1206
01:21:33,119 --> 01:21:41,257
and only those that dark things have touched can
use it. That's you and that's me, as far as I

1207
01:21:41,257 --> 01:21:48,802
know. It said it wanted you, but I wasn't going to
let him have you. It grants a wish. We can change

1208
01:21:48,802 --> 01:21:58,745
all of this. I feel like it was there in case the
dragons came out of that portal. It was facing the

1209
01:21:58,745 --> 01:22:04,239
inside of the room, it moves, and there's
something in there. I feel like it's a weapon.

1210
01:22:04,239 --> 01:22:09,838
What the fuck else are we going to do? We go for
more help, it'll get killed coming into this city.

1211
01:22:09,838 --> 01:22:15,811
We're not strong enough to take four of these
fucks.

1212
01:22:15,811 --> 01:22:21,984
TALIESIN: We have an opportunity here, but
we're going to have to be careful.

1213
01:22:27,094 --> 01:22:29,448
TRAVIS: I'm listening.

1214
01:22:29,448 --> 01:22:36,863
TALIESIN: All right. We're going to need more than
just you, we are going to need a few of the

1215
01:22:36,863 --> 01:22:38,905
others, just in case.

1216
01:22:38,905 --> 01:22:41,900
TRAVIS: They have to be touched.

1217
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:49,131
TALIESIN: This is how it's going to work. I'm
going to take it out, I'm going to have you go,

1218
01:22:49,131 --> 01:22:53,078
I'm going to remove it from its hiding place while
you go get the rest of them from upstairs.

1219
01:22:53,078 --> 01:22:55,861
TRAVIS: But who?

1220
01:22:55,861 --> 01:22:59,462
TALIESIN: At the very least, Vax, Keyleth at the
very least.

1221
01:22:59,462 --> 01:23:03,677
TRAVIS: Keyleth, she's bleached whiter than
Whitestone.

1222
01:23:03,677 --> 01:23:09,944
TALIESIN: Exactly, we need good people and I'm
going to try and talk to it. To try and discern

1223
01:23:09,944 --> 01:23:16,668
what it is and how it works and what it wants, and
if for some strange reason things go wrong, I need

1224
01:23:16,668 --> 01:23:24,286
people who would be more than willing to at the
very least knock me out. So I'm going to be

1225
01:23:24,286 --> 01:23:30,943
needing you and at least one other, preferably a
magic user ready to deal with me if something goes weird.

1226
01:23:30,943 --> 01:23:38,393
TRAVIS: I step closer to Percy. I think you only
need me.

1227
01:23:38,393 --> 01:23:41,947
TALIESIN: I need one other, just in case.

1228
01:23:41,947 --> 01:23:46,519
TRAVIS: Name <i>one</i> other.

1229
01:23:46,519 --> 01:23:58,545
TALIESIN: Keyleth-- Or Vax, pick-- Your choice,
honestly. Whoever is less busy upstairs.

1230
01:23:58,545 --> 01:24:01,435
TRAVIS: All right. I leave.

1231
01:24:01,435 --> 01:24:04,766
TALIESIN: I'm going to take the skull out
of the hiding place so he doesn't see

1232
01:24:04,766 --> 01:24:06,170
where I'm removing it from.

1233
01:24:06,170 --> 01:24:12,677
MATT: Okay. While this is happening, Pike,
Keyleth, Vax, Vex, Scanlan, all of you guys begin

1234
01:24:12,677 --> 01:24:18,213
helping the guards take beds out of your rooms and
bring them downstairs into the main foyer area,

1235
01:24:18,213 --> 01:24:25,822
basically turning this into a makeshift living
space for refugees. Heading towards and moving

1236
01:24:25,822 --> 01:24:31,447
them into the temple of Sarenrae, as you go into
the temple of Sarenrae, you get a bit of a feel of

1237
01:24:31,447 --> 01:24:34,623
the damage that was sustained from the impact of
the dragon upon the top of the keep.

1238
01:24:34,623 --> 01:24:36,742
MARISHA: I follow Pike into the temple.

1239
01:24:36,742 --> 01:24:41,173
MATT: A large portion of the stained glass on the
roof and on the outside has been shattered from

1240
01:24:41,173 --> 01:24:45,676
rocks and boulders that were-- chunks of the top
of the keep that were knocked off, and looking up

1241
01:24:45,676 --> 01:24:55,285
you can see the roof of the keep itself sustained
a fair amount of damage. Not enough to really be a

1242
01:24:55,285 --> 01:25:01,534
serious issue, but it is in a bit of disrepair
visually. As you guys are taking the beds from the

1243
01:25:01,534 --> 01:25:07,515
upstairs to the downstairs, you do notice that a
portion of the roof has caved in on the second

1244
01:25:07,515 --> 01:25:12,471
floor. The guest room has been ruined and the
southmost room, which I'll have to check to see

1245
01:25:12,471 --> 01:25:16,470
who's supposed to be living there, is partially
collapsed inwards and you can see the ceiling--

1246
01:25:16,470 --> 01:25:22,841
the sky from underneath. There is a fair amount of
damage to the top of the keep from the impact.

1247
01:25:22,841 --> 01:25:29,894
MARISHA: I back into a corner in the temple and
collapse into a corner.

1248
01:25:29,894 --> 01:25:32,094
MATT: Okay.

1249
01:25:32,094 --> 01:25:46,377
ASHLEY: I would like to go over to a quiet spot in
the temple and start saying a prayer. And I'd like

1250
01:25:46,377 --> 01:25:56,595
to cast Planar Ally. You beseech an
otherworldly entity for aid. So I would

1251
01:25:56,595 --> 01:25:58,757
like to call on Sarenrae.

1252
01:25:58,919 --> 01:26:01,577
MATT: All right, let me pull this up. What level
is this?

1253
01:26:01,684 --> 01:26:04,611
ASHLEY: It's a 6th-level.

1254
01:26:04,621 --> 01:26:08,984
MATT: All right. Let's see here--

1255
01:26:08,984 --> 01:26:14,601
ASHLEY: You have to ask the creature to perform a
service in exchange for payment.

1256
01:26:14,601 --> 01:26:22,191
MATT: Mm-hm. Yeah, what would you like to do?

1257
01:26:22,191 --> 01:26:39,254
ASHLEY: Well I think if I say-- Sarenrae, I've
been rebuilding your temple for months, so please

1258
01:26:39,254 --> 01:26:48,537
help us in battle and help rebuild our city, if
that's service enough.

1259
01:26:48,537 --> 01:27:03,553
MATT: Okay. So as you reach out, you feel
Sarenrae's warmth come to you, wordless.

1260
01:27:03,553 --> 01:27:09,467
Attempting to comfort, but even then there is a
trepidation in Sarenrae who is, you gather

1261
01:27:09,467 --> 01:27:16,406
yourself, still taking in the circumstances that
have happened. You feel that warmth begin to

1262
01:27:16,406 --> 01:27:23,872
coalesce into a specific form, and everyone who
has come into the temple with you gasps aloud as

1263
01:27:23,872 --> 01:27:31,107
over these central worship platforms in the center
of the temple, a glowing orb begin to form that

1264
01:27:31,107 --> 01:27:36,895
then slowly takes the form of a humanoid with
wings, similar to the ones you've worn in your

1265
01:27:36,895 --> 01:27:45,298
celestial form. As the light fades, you can see,
levitating roughly a foot off the ground, a human.

1266
01:27:45,298 --> 01:27:52,575
White eyes and pale blue skin, hairless with a
simple breastplate that's silver with gold lining

1267
01:27:52,575 --> 01:27:58,047
on it, a single sword sheathed on the side, and
beautiful white angel wings sprouting from its

1268
01:27:58,047 --> 01:28:06,200
back. The entity stands there and looks down
towards you. "I have been sent to your aid. Are

1269
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:18,474
"you, Pike Trickfoot, to give me a task?" The voice
itself seems otherworldly, and understanding the

1270
01:28:18,474 --> 01:28:25,050
basis of the spell, you need a specific task in
mind for it, and it is expensive to maintain in

1271
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:29,585
materials, the longer the task requires.

1272
01:28:29,585 --> 01:28:44,138
ASHLEY: Okay. We need your help. As you can see,
our city has fallen to pieces by these dragons

1273
01:28:44,249 --> 01:28:53,057
that are attacking us. And we ask that you aid us
in battle somehow.

1274
01:28:53,057 --> 01:28:59,955
MATT: "Lead me to a battle if you wish. I haven't
much time on your plane. If you have a task that I

1275
01:28:59,955 --> 01:29:06,438
"can complete at this moment." And you know that to
maintain this spell cost about 100 gold per minute.

1276
01:29:06,438 --> 01:29:09,796
ASHLEY: Okay. Ah, shit. Okay.

1277
01:29:09,796 --> 01:29:19,237
MATT: Or 1,000 gold per hour depending on the-- Or
10,000 gold per day. Yeah, it depends on the task

1278
01:29:19,237 --> 01:29:22,834
it required. It needs to be a little more specific
than just "aid us in battle," because if there

1279
01:29:22,834 --> 01:29:27,078
isn't a immediate battle happening, because the
longer it's out, the more expensive it will be.

1280
01:29:27,078 --> 01:29:31,517
You asked it to rebuild and it looks to you and
says, "If you require my aid in rebuilding..." She

1281
01:29:31,517 --> 01:29:39,485
looks with her head around the temple. "This I can
help with quite a bit of haste, as it is within

1282
01:29:39,485 --> 01:29:44,886
"the realm of our patron lady."

1283
01:29:44,886 --> 01:29:51,853
ASHLEY: Okay, well, yes. Rebuild our keep.

1284
01:29:51,853 --> 01:29:58,549
MATT: "It will be done, within the hour." So you
can mark off 1,000 gold worth of materials, and at

1285
01:29:58,549 --> 01:30:03,739
this point, the Planar Ally's wings unfurl and
begin to float up, and as it does it lift its

1286
01:30:03,739 --> 01:30:09,236
hands and all the shattered stained glass begins
to lift off the ground with it. And you watch as

1287
01:30:09,236 --> 01:30:12,017
they all begin to reform.

1288
01:30:12,017 --> 01:30:13,419
LAURA: That's pretty sick.

1289
01:30:13,419 --> 01:30:20,137
MATT: And begin to, through pure divine energy,
rebuild the entirely of the temple around within a

1290
01:30:20,137 --> 01:30:26,072
matter of minutes. While everyone else is looking
in awe, you can begin to see around you, many

1291
01:30:26,072 --> 01:30:31,583
people who had been shaken to the core of their
being, who had lost all hope, even this visual

1292
01:30:31,583 --> 01:30:36,198
representation of the power of Sarenrae and the
faith you put into her, you can see people are now

1293
01:30:36,198 --> 01:30:43,272
bowing in deep prayer at the center of the temple
as it's being rebuilt. This has been a very

1294
01:30:43,272 --> 01:30:49,581
impactful moment for the survivors you've taken
under your wing.

1295
01:30:49,581 --> 01:30:55,785
MARISHA: I wander over to Pike and just I grab her
hand as I watch.

1296
01:30:55,785 --> 01:30:56,981
MATT: All right.

1297
01:30:56,981 --> 01:31:02,160
LAURA: I'm busying myself trying to bandage any of
the survivors that seem injured.

1298
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:06,939
MATT: Okay. There are injuries, many sustained
from rubble falling or trying to get out as fast

1299
01:31:06,939 --> 01:31:13,088
as possible, slamming themselves into ruins or
fallen rock and flaming or whatever else happened.

1300
01:31:13,088 --> 01:31:15,533
So you tend to the wounds, so you guys are helping
out with those who are hurt.

1301
01:31:15,533 --> 01:31:23,379
LIAM: I'm helping and as we do so I say: I don't
know what's going to happen in the following

1302
01:31:23,379 --> 01:31:33,919
hours. Do not go far from me. If we are
out of earshot, you are too far from me.

1303
01:31:33,919 --> 01:31:35,695
Do not go far from me.

1304
01:31:35,726 --> 01:31:48,942
LAURA: Do you think this is what-- Do you think
this is what Mother saw before she died?

1305
01:31:48,942 --> 01:31:51,082
LIAM: Do not go far from me.

1306
01:31:51,082 --> 01:31:57,790
LAURA: I won't, I swear.

1307
01:31:57,790 --> 01:32:01,505
MATT: Percy and Grog, you find your way back up to
the foyer.

1308
01:32:01,505 --> 01:32:10,319
TALIESIN: The second he leaves the keep, I rush to
pull the skull out, shut the door, put it on the

1309
01:32:10,319 --> 01:32:15,373
table, sit down in front of it, and say, okay,
talk. You have my attention.

1310
01:32:15,373 --> 01:32:16,575
MATT: Okay.

1311
01:32:16,575 --> 01:32:18,064
TALIESIN: Okay, I got a minute before he comes
back.

1312
01:32:18,064 --> 01:32:21,184
MATT: You do, you do.

1313
01:32:21,194 --> 01:32:24,373
LAURA: He's a dick.

1314
01:32:24,373 --> 01:32:27,363
LIAM: He's just a sociopath, that's all.

1315
01:32:50,503 --> 01:33:00,491
[no audio]

1316
01:33:00,491 --> 01:33:02,002
TRAVIS: Fire and ice sale.

1317
01:33:02,119 --> 01:33:09,020
LAURA: Hey, check out those Critical Role shirts
on Geekandsundry.com. They sure are lovely.

1318
01:33:09,020 --> 01:33:13,654
MARISHA: Donate to 826LA.

1319
01:33:18,423 --> 01:33:20,826
MARISHA: Oh god, I feel like I should scootch
over.

1320
01:33:20,826 --> 01:33:26,584
LAURA: I know, can't hear it?

1321
01:33:26,584 --> 01:33:29,918
LIAM: That is a long talk.

1322
01:33:29,918 --> 01:33:31,966
TALIESIN: (softly) At what price?

1323
01:33:31,966 --> 01:33:35,388
LAURA: Ugh, what is he saying? Oh my god.

1324
01:33:35,388 --> 01:33:36,986
MATT: All right, sorry.

1325
01:33:36,986 --> 01:33:41,593
TALIESIN: I then take the velvet cloth and put it
back over it and put it over and set it up as if I

1326
01:33:41,593 --> 01:33:42,948
haven't talked to it.

1327
01:33:42,948 --> 01:33:47,786
MATT: Okay, all right, so. And once again
reminding you, the skull itself, it's humanoid but

1328
01:33:47,786 --> 01:33:54,852
it's elongated, it's not a human skull. Its jaw
itself is-- you would say almost elvish, but the

1329
01:33:54,852 --> 01:34:00,185
features are too sunken, the teeth are too long,
and the skull itself is a little more oblong to

1330
01:34:00,185 --> 01:34:08,585
the back. Yeah, you're unfamiliar what species or
race this may have been when it was alive.

1331
01:34:08,585 --> 01:34:14,154
TRAVIS: As I was leaving, can I notice anything
about the back of his door? Like is-- a lock or is

1332
01:34:14,154 --> 01:34:16,351
it flat, plain?

1333
01:34:16,351 --> 01:34:22,734
MATT: I'm gonna go ahead and have you make an
investigation check.

1334
01:34:22,734 --> 01:34:24,954
TRAVIS: 13. Minus two, you asshole.

1335
01:34:24,954 --> 01:34:27,586
(laughter)

1336
01:34:27,586 --> 01:34:31,755
MATT: As you start walking out, you turn and look
at the door and take a moment to inspect it. I

1337
01:34:31,755 --> 01:34:38,750
mean, Grog, doors are doors, you know how to deal
with doors. This is a weird door. You don't know

1338
01:34:38,750 --> 01:34:40,877
how this door works.

1339
01:34:40,877 --> 01:34:42,800
TALIESIN: My door is unlocked.

1340
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:45,493
MATT: Right, but he doesn't understand the
mechanism of what--

1341
01:34:45,493 --> 01:34:49,417
TALIESIN: Oh, no. I built with you in mind.

1342
01:34:49,417 --> 01:34:54,042
TRAVIS: I bet I can figure the lock from the
inside. And I open the door and it opens because

1343
01:34:54,042 --> 01:34:55,285
it's unlocked.

1344
01:34:55,285 --> 01:35:01,572
MATT: Okay, right, as soon as you throw the velvet
over, the door opens up.

1345
01:35:01,572 --> 01:35:06,605
TRAVIS: I go up and I try and find Vax.

1346
01:35:06,605 --> 01:35:12,016
MATT: Okay, you go up and you see the two of them
helping people along, making eye contact. You can

1347
01:35:12,016 --> 01:35:16,500
see the drying tears across their faces as they
are trying to stay strong for those that are

1348
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:20,508
currently in a less emotionally stable position
right now.

1349
01:35:20,508 --> 01:35:26,279
TRAVIS: Sorry to break up an awkward moment, Vax,
do you have a moment?

1350
01:35:26,279 --> 01:35:27,925
LIAM: What do you need?

1351
01:35:27,925 --> 01:35:32,495
TRAVIS: May I speak to you alone? No offense,
Vex.

1352
01:35:32,495 --> 01:35:38,166
LAURA: None taken. I go and help other people and
call to Trinket to carry over some bandages for me.

1353
01:35:38,166 --> 01:35:39,097
MATT: Okay.

1354
01:35:39,097 --> 01:35:43,665
TRAVIS: You and I may have had some friction
recently, and we have our differences, but we're

1355
01:35:43,665 --> 01:35:52,699
on the same side. Percy needs you downstairs. Will
you come with me?

1356
01:35:52,699 --> 01:36:00,411
LIAM: I look at my sister. What is it? What does
he need?

1357
01:36:00,411 --> 01:36:06,171
TRAVIS: I would tell you, but I don't want to
frighten anyone in this room. It's about the--

1358
01:36:06,171 --> 01:36:13,344
(quieter) It's about the skull and I can only
bring one. Percy's request.

1359
01:36:13,344 --> 01:36:15,232
LIAM: Wait here.

1360
01:36:15,232 --> 01:36:17,111
TRAVIS: I have to come with you.

1361
01:36:17,111 --> 01:36:24,881
LIAM: Just wait a second. I walk over to my
sister. I'm going downstairs. If I'm not back here

1362
01:36:24,881 --> 01:36:29,648
in five minutes, I want you to come down, do you
understand? And I say that because I need you, you

1363
01:36:29,648 --> 01:36:39,058
are stronger than me and I will need you. Tend to
the wounded, five minutes. I follow Grog.

1364
01:36:39,058 --> 01:36:39,846
MATT: All right.

1365
01:36:39,846 --> 01:36:41,381
TRAVIS: I go back downstairs.

1366
01:36:41,381 --> 01:36:44,161
LAURA: I Hunter's Mark Grog as he walks away.

1367
01:36:44,161 --> 01:36:45,179
TRAVIS: What? Why?

1368
01:36:45,179 --> 01:36:46,537
LAURA: I don't know. I just do.

1369
01:36:46,537 --> 01:36:52,246
MATT: Okay. I'm going ahead and say make a sleight
of hand check and make a perception check.

1370
01:36:52,246 --> 01:36:54,846
TRAVIS: I'm sure this is going to go dandy.

1371
01:36:54,846 --> 01:36:57,512
19! (laughs)

1372
01:36:57,512 --> 01:36:59,945
LAURA: Fucking A!

1373
01:36:59,945 --> 01:37:02,027
TRAVIS: I don't know why I'm so excited right now.
Everything's dead.

1374
01:37:02,027 --> 01:37:03,880
LAURA: 15.

1375
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:12,646
MATT: As you're walking away, you feel this
strange pulse of tingling energy. Almost like a soft--

1376
01:37:12,646 --> 01:37:14,181
LAURA: Aw, you know what?

1377
01:37:14,181 --> 01:37:15,026
MATT: What?

1378
01:37:15,026 --> 01:37:19,567
LAURA: I haven't chosen my fucking rogue ability
yet, my rogue proficiency.

1379
01:37:19,567 --> 01:37:22,411
LIAM: Rogue proficiency bump.

1380
01:37:22,411 --> 01:37:25,413
LAURA: Too late now.

1381
01:37:25,413 --> 01:37:29,147
MATT: You feel this magical essence creep up on
you. You are not familiar with it, but you feel

1382
01:37:29,147 --> 01:37:32,376
like something just attached to you.

1383
01:37:32,376 --> 01:37:34,427
TRAVIS: From any direction? Or just attached?

1384
01:37:34,427 --> 01:37:36,158
MATT: You aren't entirely sure.

1385
01:37:36,158 --> 01:37:44,245
TRAVIS: I look about. Is there anything looking at
me? Anybody throw anything at me? Pour anything on me?

1386
01:37:44,245 --> 01:37:49,745
MATT: Make a stealth check, Vex.

1387
01:37:49,745 --> 01:37:56,340
LAURA: I'm choosing my dice. Okay, okay, okay. I
get advantage on all stealth checks?

1388
01:37:56,340 --> 01:38:00,508
LIAM: Yes. Because the cloak, yes

1389
01:38:00,508 --> 01:38:02,020
LAURA: 24.

1390
01:38:02,020 --> 01:38:06,230
MATT: You look about, and in the chaos of the
people, you have no idea what the source of this

1391
01:38:06,230 --> 01:38:07,592
weird tingling was.

1392
01:38:07,592 --> 01:38:11,289
TRAVIS: This keep is fucking drafty. I go
downstairs.

1393
01:38:11,289 --> 01:38:16,908
MATT: Okay. As you walk downstairs, you find your
way to Percy's workshop, we're going to take a break.

1394
01:38:16,908 --> 01:38:18,143
(cheering)

1395
01:38:18,143 --> 01:38:19,280
LAURA: Jeez Louise.

1396
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:20,176
LIAM: Thank goodness.

1397
01:38:20,176 --> 01:38:22,410
MATT: All right, make this one quick guys, get
back into it while we still have the tension in

1398
01:38:22,410 --> 01:38:25,505
the story going. So we'll see you guys here in a
few minutes.

1399
01:38:25,505 --> 01:38:26,907
TRAVIS: Five minutes, five minutes.

1400
01:38:26,907 --> 01:38:28,877
LIAM: Five minutes. Pizza and five minutes.

1401
01:38:28,877 --> 01:38:29,776
MATT: You good?

1402
01:38:29,776 --> 01:38:31,009
LAURA: Is the food here?

1403
01:38:31,009 --> 01:38:32,196
MATT: It should be, I hope so.

1404
01:38:32,196 --> 01:39:12,523
[break]

1405
01:39:12,523 --> 01:39:15,706
MATT: Hi, my name is Matthew Mercer, I'm a voice
actor and the dungeon master for Geek and Sundry's

1406
01:39:15,706 --> 01:39:20,507
Critical Role, and welcome to my short video
series for my tips on how to dungeon master or

1407
01:39:20,507 --> 01:39:23,105
game master your own roleplaying games.

1408
01:39:23,105 --> 01:39:29,569
So today, our first topic is going to be Encounter
Building. So when you are creating an encounter, a

1409
01:39:29,569 --> 01:39:35,089
combat encounter specifically for your party of
adventurers or space marines or whatever else you

1410
01:39:35,089 --> 01:39:39,387
are running, you want to consider what kind of
terrain or region is this going to have. That's

1411
01:39:39,387 --> 01:39:44,019
going to go ahead and help you guide what
creatures are going to be there, what type of

1412
01:39:44,019 --> 01:39:48,754
challenges might be in that way. So consider, is
it a icy tundra, is it a frozen mountaintop or is

1413
01:39:48,754 --> 01:39:53,919
it like a hot, muggy swampland, is it a
underground cave network? There are actually a lot

1414
01:39:53,919 --> 01:39:57,489
of these resource books that you can find for
these RPGs that will have listings of creatures

1415
01:39:57,489 --> 01:40:02,062
and monsters and dangers by topography, and by
weather, and that's a really cool way to see what

1416
01:40:02,062 --> 01:40:05,939
indigenous creatures might live there, and that's
a good resource to pull from if you're not having

1417
01:40:05,939 --> 01:40:09,684
any creative juices helping you decide what to put
in front of them.

1418
01:40:09,684 --> 01:40:14,055
Secondly, you want to consider how challenging you
want the encounter or encounters to be. Do you

1419
01:40:14,055 --> 01:40:18,271
want it to be a really quick scuffle, do you want
it to be a series of small battles, as to opposed

1420
01:40:18,271 --> 01:40:24,506
to fighting in a long hallway, in a spaceship? Do
you want it to be one giant climatic multi-leveled

1421
01:40:24,506 --> 01:40:28,551
boss confrontation? Once you've made that
decision, that'll help you figure out how

1422
01:40:28,551 --> 01:40:33,961
dangerous, how extensive, and how powerful the
villains may be for this encounter. There's a lot

1423
01:40:33,961 --> 01:40:39,804
of great resource manuals for every RPG system out
there that have breakdowns about what creatures

1424
01:40:39,804 --> 01:40:44,520
are good for which player levels as far as power
or challenge and danger is concerned. Like, for

1425
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:48,941
instance, the dungeon master's guide and monster
manual have a challenge rating system. A creature

1426
01:40:48,941 --> 01:40:52,619
of a certain challenge rating is a decent
challenge for a group of four players of that

1427
01:40:52,619 --> 01:40:54,938
level, and you can slide the scale from there.

1428
01:40:54,938 --> 01:40:59,753
Also, the DMG, or the Dungeon Master's Guide, has
a experience threshold table in there as well that

1429
01:40:59,753 --> 01:41:04,037
helps you build encounters based on the total
experience points the creatures are fighting. So

1430
01:41:04,037 --> 01:41:07,189
those are really cool resources, if you're new to
the system and you're still trying to figure out

1431
01:41:07,189 --> 01:41:10,550
how to balance that properly. Over time,
eventually you'll just get a feel for it.

1432
01:41:10,550 --> 01:41:14,389
Experience helps you get a little more comfortable
with balancing the battle, and you want to make

1433
01:41:14,389 --> 01:41:17,751
sure you don't kill all your players way too
quickly in the game, either. There's also a really

1434
01:41:17,751 --> 01:41:21,950
good website called Kobold Fight Club, for those
who are running Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th edition

1435
01:41:21,950 --> 01:41:26,749
campaigns, that helps them build an entire
encounter with the experience table stuff that

1436
01:41:26,749 --> 01:41:30,850
helps you get an idea of what could and could not
be considered too powerful.

1437
01:41:30,850 --> 01:41:35,351
And don't forget, if you can't find a creature or
monster in these realms or any sort of villain

1438
01:41:35,351 --> 01:41:41,050
that suits your need for the storyline or this
particular battle, you can create one. Make one up

1439
01:41:41,050 --> 01:41:44,352
or take something that's there and customize it
and alter it, make it more powerful, make it

1440
01:41:44,352 --> 01:41:48,850
weaker, you know? If you really, really want to
run a game that has a bunch of kobolds as the main

1441
01:41:48,850 --> 01:41:52,458
villain, but all your players are level ten? Go
ahead and make yourself some more powerful

1442
01:41:52,458 --> 01:41:56,322
kobolds. You can customize 'em all you want.
Everything in there is just a baseline suggestion

1443
01:41:56,322 --> 01:42:00,614
of what they think, or they created initially to
be, but you can always scale them, you can make

1444
01:42:00,614 --> 01:42:04,721
them more powerful, you can add additional hit
points, make them do more damage per attack.

1445
01:42:04,721 --> 01:42:09,118
Increase their defenses, give it some hidden
resistances or vulnerabilities. You can even

1446
01:42:09,118 --> 01:42:13,483
create whole new abilities, I customize creatures
all the time for my game. I think it, one, makes

1447
01:42:13,483 --> 01:42:18,014
it more interesting and more customized to the
specific encounter and world. Secondly, for

1448
01:42:18,014 --> 01:42:21,650
players who have been playing for a long time and
pretty much memorized the monster manual, it keeps

1449
01:42:21,650 --> 01:42:26,392
them on their toes because they'll be encountering
monsters that they have yet to memorize everything

1450
01:42:26,392 --> 01:42:30,325
about. Also, make sure, though, if you do use
these creatures and you want them to have

1451
01:42:30,325 --> 01:42:35,815
interesting defenses and vulnerabilities and the
like, make sure you highlight them or note them,

1452
01:42:35,815 --> 01:42:39,415
it's very easy to rush into combat and forget some
of these cool things. So I always use a

1453
01:42:39,415 --> 01:42:43,862
highlighter and highlight the various notes and
elements of these creatures or these combat

1454
01:42:43,862 --> 01:42:48,577
scenarios that I want to make sure that I remember
and recall in the heat of battle.

1455
01:42:48,577 --> 01:42:53,509
The next note I want to bring up is battlefields.
First and foremost, not every game needs a

1456
01:42:53,509 --> 01:42:58,183
battlefield. In fact, I kind of prefer RPGs that
don't have a battle map with miniatures, it's just

1457
01:42:58,183 --> 01:43:02,534
a way to play. I prefer to keep things in my
imagination, but that's generally more wieldy with

1458
01:43:02,534 --> 01:43:06,313
smaller groups, if you have three, maybe four
players. Larger than that, it gets a little

1459
01:43:06,313 --> 01:43:13,114
unwieldy, and me running six to eight players, it
has become very necessary for everyone to keep

1460
01:43:13,114 --> 01:43:18,629
track of their spatial awareness. When you create
a map, things to consider, creative terrain. You

1461
01:43:18,629 --> 01:43:22,174
know, think of where it's are happening, but ways
to make it different on occasion, too. You can

1462
01:43:22,174 --> 01:43:25,947
have straight forward battles with just, here's an
area where they fight, here's some hallways,

1463
01:43:25,947 --> 01:43:30,277
here's some rooms, and that's cool, too, but if
you're in an urban setting, have furniture they

1464
01:43:30,277 --> 01:43:33,961
can use to their advantage, whether it be for
height or for setting up blockades.

1465
01:43:33,961 --> 01:43:38,172
Also, consider what other challenges and
confrontations they might have with the terrain

1466
01:43:38,172 --> 01:43:41,345
during the battlefield. Is there a giant chasm
they have to get across to actually get to the

1467
01:43:41,345 --> 01:43:45,280
villain while they're attacking them from a
distance? Is there some sort of arcane field

1468
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:48,511
that's locked off a portion of the battlefield and
they have to figure out some sort of puzzle during

1469
01:43:48,511 --> 01:43:53,280
the battle to lock it down? Is invulnerable to all
damage until they can find some sort of hidden

1470
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:59,345
aspect of their soul locked within a nearby
battlefield, or is there a bunch of innocents in

1471
01:43:59,345 --> 01:44:03,777
there as well that are in danger of being killed
from the collateral damage? Find cool and unique

1472
01:44:03,777 --> 01:44:08,652
ways to make it an interesting battle outside of a
slug fest of HP being knocked away and whoever

1473
01:44:08,652 --> 01:44:11,803
falls first. Mind you, those can be fun,
too, on occasion, but you want to make sure

1474
01:44:11,803 --> 01:44:12,922
to keep things interesting.

1475
01:44:12,922 --> 01:44:15,959
For those who want to create battlefields, what I
use for my battlefields, because it has been

1476
01:44:15,959 --> 01:44:20,721
requested a few times. You can use easel pad
paper, one-inch grid easel pad paper that you can

1477
01:44:20,721 --> 01:44:24,775
find online, and that's a real cool way to draw on
that using markers and create your own

1478
01:44:24,775 --> 01:44:29,040
battlefields that way. There are great tutorials
online too that show you how to make cool battles

1479
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:33,665
and interesting-looking terrain with simple
hatch-mark shading and minor colors, so I highly

1480
01:44:33,708 --> 01:44:35,141
recommend that.

1481
01:44:35,141 --> 01:44:40,224
Also, when you're using intelligent creatures,
especially monsters or individuals or villains

1482
01:44:40,224 --> 01:44:45,986
that are understanding their own mortality, they
may flee. When they hit about half or a quarter

1483
01:44:45,986 --> 01:44:51,189
hit points, they maybe want to get the heck out of
Dodge. So don't be afraid to let your villains or

1484
01:44:51,189 --> 01:44:55,294
enemies do that on occasion. One, it ups the
stakes immediately in a battle from a slog fest

1485
01:44:55,294 --> 01:44:59,568
to, oh crap he's getting away, and the dynamic
shifts to try and prevent them from doing so. And

1486
01:44:59,568 --> 01:45:03,961
secondly, if they do manage to get away, you may
have a juicy villain who can recur later on down

1487
01:45:03,961 --> 01:45:09,077
the story with a need for vengeance. Vengeance!

1488
01:45:09,077 --> 01:45:13,001
Another cool note, not all battles are meant to be
won, either. Sometimes you want to introduce a

1489
01:45:13,001 --> 01:45:17,837
really powerful enemy as a foreshadowing aspect, a
creature that they can in no way, shape or form

1490
01:45:17,837 --> 01:45:22,305
defeat, and they are meant to flee from, so that
they can build towards down the road, maybe coming

1491
01:45:22,305 --> 01:45:27,278
back and finally killing it as a means of
vengeance. Just make sure you try and insinuate to

1492
01:45:27,278 --> 01:45:31,094
the players that they shouldn't stick around for
the whole fight or you might have a TPK on your

1493
01:45:31,094 --> 01:45:36,276
hands, so be careful with that one. It's a fun
tool, but be careful. No, seriously, be careful.

1494
01:45:36,276 --> 01:45:38,863
Plus, it also leaves a cool story like, "Man, you
remember that one time we almost got killed by

1495
01:45:38,863 --> 01:45:39,801
"that thing?"

1496
01:45:39,801 --> 01:45:44,263
Not all fights are meant to end in bloodshed, as
well. So don't be afraid to let the players

1497
01:45:44,263 --> 01:45:48,109
diplomatically resolve an encounter. Sometimes
battles happen because of misunderstandings or

1498
01:45:48,109 --> 01:45:52,873
misinformation or the wrong thing was said and it
ticks somebody off. That doesn't mean they have to

1499
01:45:52,873 --> 01:45:56,631
fight to the bitter end and murder whoever's in
front of them. You don't want the whole murderhobo

1500
01:45:56,631 --> 01:46:00,367
syndrome to be consistent, unless that's the
campaign you're running, in which case, fight on,

1501
01:46:00,367 --> 01:46:05,145
my murderhobos. But let the players use their
social skills to try and defuse an encounter

1502
01:46:05,145 --> 01:46:08,002
before anyone gets killed. I've many games where
halfway through a battle, they're like, "Wait,

1503
01:46:08,002 --> 01:46:11,704
"they may have information we need," or, "Maybe we
were duped and have the wrong information," and

1504
01:46:11,704 --> 01:46:16,313
they decide to diplomatically end it. It doesn't
always work, but it's nice to give them that option.

1505
01:46:16,313 --> 01:47:42,086
[break]

1506
01:47:42,086 --> 01:47:47,540
MATT: All righty guys, welcome back. So before
jumping in here real fast, we got a couple things.

1507
01:47:47,540 --> 01:47:53,670
One, we have a winner for our next giveaway, for
all you awesome subscribers out there. The winner

1508
01:47:53,670 --> 01:47:56,174
is Blackshadow773!

1509
01:47:56,174 --> 01:47:57,750
(cheering)

1510
01:47:57,750 --> 01:47:58,819
MATT: Appropriate place for a shoutout.

1511
01:47:58,819 --> 01:48:00,021
LAURA: That's really appropriate.

1512
01:48:00,021 --> 01:48:02,494
MATT: We'll send you an awesome package with a
bunch of goodies, Critical Role goodies, some

1513
01:48:02,494 --> 01:48:08,416
signed stuff, some fun things coming your way, so
that's fun. Also, I forgot to do it in the

1514
01:48:08,416 --> 01:48:13,820
announcements earlier, but I have a couple of new
music tracks and some things coming forward that

1515
01:48:13,820 --> 01:48:17,918
I'll be able to incorporate into the game from
awesome guys named Battlebards. They did a

1516
01:48:17,918 --> 01:48:22,230
Kickstarter a while back to create RPG-specific
music and sound effects and audio tracks and they

1517
01:48:22,230 --> 01:48:26,154
were nice enough to give me some of their stuff to
use in the show. So if you're running your own

1518
01:48:26,154 --> 01:48:33,154
game and want some good music and soundscape stuff
to work on, Battlebards' got some pretty cool

1519
01:48:33,154 --> 01:48:42,819
stuff, so thank you guys. All righty, so.
Returning as it was, Grog and Vax, you make your

1520
01:48:42,819 --> 01:48:48,498
way down to the basement of Greyskull Keep. The
door's still partially ajar as Grog left it. You

1521
01:48:48,498 --> 01:48:49,820
enter the room--

1522
01:48:49,820 --> 01:48:57,942
TRAVIS: Before we go in, I would like to put my
hand on Vax. Just a note, I tried to do this by

1523
01:48:57,942 --> 01:49:05,177
myself, but the skull asked for Percy. I know he
didn't respond well with all that dark shadowy

1524
01:49:05,177 --> 01:49:15,129
stuff, so be careful. I'm not entirely sure we can
trust him with it. I wanted to do it myself, but it

1525
01:49:15,129 --> 01:49:21,920
was either you or Keyleth, and you're a prick, so
I picked you.

1526
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:24,525
LIAM: I don't say anything.

1527
01:49:24,525 --> 01:49:31,809
MATT: Okay. You guys enter. Percy is there
waiting, hands behind his back. There is the table

1528
01:49:31,809 --> 01:49:37,463
on one of his workbench areas that has a piece of
tapestry that you guys originally had wrapped the

1529
01:49:37,463 --> 01:49:40,478
skull in, draped over it, it's currently not
visible.

1530
01:49:40,478 --> 01:49:45,082
LIAM: What's going on, Percival?

1531
01:49:45,082 --> 01:49:52,659
TALIESIN: Good. I felt that this was only possible
if we had a few more witnesses. We have an

1532
01:49:52,659 --> 01:49:54,177
artifact.

1533
01:49:54,177 --> 01:49:56,296
LIAM: Good.

1534
01:49:56,296 --> 01:50:06,865
TALIESIN: A skull. There is something alive inside
the skull. There is something evil, or at least

1535
01:50:06,865 --> 01:50:18,428
not good, inside the skull, and it is offering to
grant us any wish we desire if we set it free.

1536
01:50:18,428 --> 01:50:32,009
Now. Grog is inclined to take this deal. I am, and
I imagine this is surprising, having some

1537
01:50:32,009 --> 01:50:45,110
reservations. I like having the terms spelled out,
and I feel that so far the terms have not been

1538
01:50:45,110 --> 01:50:50,526
spelled out. I'm going to lift the fabric off.

1539
01:50:50,526 --> 01:50:52,920
TRAVIS: I go and shut the door.

1540
01:50:52,920 --> 01:50:56,706
MATT: Okay, and as you lift the fabric off, and
you have a look at it as well, in this controlled

1541
01:50:56,706 --> 01:51:04,232
environment, still facing you, the skull, which
once again has the elongated form, the longer

1542
01:51:04,232 --> 01:51:12,378
teeth and jaw, it has the one gem that's embedded
in the eye socket, and you can see there's a

1543
01:51:12,378 --> 01:51:18,560
little bit of almost like a spectral swirl to it,
like there's something fluid in the actual gem

1544
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:20,329
itself.

1545
01:51:20,329 --> 01:51:29,320
LIAM: Well, Freddie, I imagine I'm wondering the
same thing you are, at least I hope, and that's:

1546
01:51:29,320 --> 01:51:32,195
what's in it for the skull?

1547
01:51:32,195 --> 01:51:38,895
TALIESIN: He wants to be freed. It. How would we free
you?

1548
01:51:38,895 --> 01:51:45,376
MATT: There's a slight pause before you can see
the gem, the swirl coalesces into what looks like

1549
01:51:45,376 --> 01:51:52,100
a spectral face. You can make out what looks to be
eyes, a mouth and a nose. Though the nose itself

1550
01:51:52,100 --> 01:51:55,626
is less of a pronounced human nose and--

1551
01:51:55,626 --> 01:51:58,480
LIAM: I'm looking at the floor, I'm not looking at
it.

1552
01:51:58,480 --> 01:52:08,391
MATT: Okay. But you see where the nose is, instead there
are two nasal passages. And you hear a voice

1553
01:52:08,391 --> 01:52:17,851
slowly creak out from it and say, "All that I
require is for you to destroy this prison. Free my

1554
01:52:17,851 --> 01:52:22,957
"spirit from generations of torment, that is all I
ask."

1555
01:52:22,957 --> 01:52:33,329
LIAM: Hey, quick question, who are you? Who were
you before you were in this prison?

1556
01:52:33,329 --> 01:52:39,098
MATT: "It's been too long, too long have I been
here, I do not know who I am."

1557
01:52:39,098 --> 01:52:41,602
LIAM: Ah, well, go fuck yourself. And I put the
blanket over it.

1558
01:52:41,602 --> 01:52:44,031
MATT: The blanket covers the skull.

1559
01:52:44,031 --> 01:52:51,521
LIAM: This seems like a very bad idea to me. Why
are we doing this? Didn't we do this already, once

1560
01:52:51,521 --> 01:52:52,771
before?

1561
01:52:52,771 --> 01:52:57,078
TALIESIN: It was an option, and I felt it was
worth exploring, and I think now we do have an

1562
01:52:57,078 --> 01:53:01,554
option, which is we have to take it somewhere and
have him identified. We have to know who this is.

1563
01:53:01,554 --> 01:53:07,849
TRAVIS: What are you talking about? If it wants to
be set free, fuck him, it's a wish. It's like a

1564
01:53:07,849 --> 01:53:12,591
genie that wants out of a can, you don't grant it
its wish, you get your fucking wish first.

1565
01:53:12,591 --> 01:53:14,863
TALIESIN: It's not always genies in cans.

1566
01:53:14,863 --> 01:53:22,677
LIAM: If we wish to rid Emon of these dragons,
then we've got nothing to deal with this fucking

1567
01:53:22,677 --> 01:53:25,237
thing right here, whatever it is.

1568
01:53:25,237 --> 01:53:28,510
TALIESIN: I would like to know before we make any
deals, we need a name.

1569
01:53:28,510 --> 01:53:34,122
TRAVIS: Hold on, hold on, hold on, look, we have a
chance to do good now, right now. People are

1570
01:53:34,122 --> 01:53:36,643
dying. More people are dying.

1571
01:53:36,643 --> 01:53:38,841
TALIESIN: We have a chance to kick the can down
the road.

1572
01:53:38,841 --> 01:53:41,486
TRAVIS: I don't understand.

1573
01:53:41,486 --> 01:53:46,542
LIAM: He's speaking literally, Grog.

1574
01:53:46,542 --> 01:53:51,960
TALIESIN: We don't know that whatever is in here
could be worse than what's out there.

1575
01:53:51,960 --> 01:53:54,613
LIAM: I had a thought--

1576
01:53:54,613 --> 01:54:02,021
TALIESIN: But we could find out, and since it's a
wish, we'll have plenty of room to fix this. We

1577
01:54:02,021 --> 01:54:03,653
don't have to do it immediately.

1578
01:54:03,653 --> 01:54:05,557
TRAVIS: Are you a betting man, Percival?

1579
01:54:05,557 --> 01:54:06,617
TALIESIN: Yes.

1580
01:54:06,617 --> 01:54:10,854
TRAVIS: If I told you that four giant ancient
fuck-off death dragons were attacking the city and

1581
01:54:10,854 --> 01:54:18,282
all of us barely managed to break one of its pinky
toes, you're saying what's in there is worse than them?

1582
01:54:18,282 --> 01:54:24,889
TALIESIN: I don't know. It's in there, isn't it?
And how do we know the dragons weren't guarding it

1583
01:54:24,889 --> 01:54:29,889
as opposed to it being a signal? It could be the
thing they're angry about.

1584
01:54:29,889 --> 01:54:40,060
LIAM: I think-- I have a thought I haven't spoken
out loud yet. Every divine being that exists is

1585
01:54:40,060 --> 01:54:48,819
accessible through Vasselheim. We are not equipped
to handle this problem. Maybe this skull will do

1586
01:54:48,819 --> 01:54:55,188
something, maybe, that's a bit fucking maybe.
We're not equipped, and we don't know what dealing

1587
01:54:55,188 --> 01:55:02,623
with that thing will bring. We will go to
Vasselheim tomorrow. We bring all the people in

1588
01:55:02,623 --> 01:55:10,096
this keep with us, Keyleth sends them through the
tree. They stay there, we find help. We cannot

1589
01:55:10,096 --> 01:55:15,236
handle this on our own. My first instinct was to
go back in for Uriel. We don't know what's

1590
01:55:15,236 --> 01:55:20,950
happened to Uriel! But we can't do it, we are
powerless against those things. Against one of

1591
01:55:20,950 --> 01:55:24,356
them, let alone four. We need help.

1592
01:55:24,356 --> 01:55:30,358
TALIESIN: I wave my hand, and the skull drops into
a shadow on the table and vanishes.

1593
01:55:30,358 --> 01:55:32,290
MATT: Okay.

1594
01:55:32,290 --> 01:55:35,925
LIAM: Did that blanket just blob down?

1595
01:55:35,925 --> 01:55:40,828
TALIESIN: The blanket vanished into the shadow as
well, it's now just a shadow. I've put it back in

1596
01:55:40,828 --> 01:55:42,411
its hiding place.

1597
01:55:42,411 --> 01:55:43,791
TRAVIS: What the fuck was that?

1598
01:55:43,791 --> 01:55:49,857
TALIESIN: That was a reminder that you should know
what you're dealing with before you touch power.

1599
01:55:49,857 --> 01:55:52,488
TRAVIS: Can you do magic?

1600
01:55:52,488 --> 01:56:03,924
TALIESIN: Yes. I'm not going to pretend I always
make the best calls. But I at least would like to

1601
01:56:03,924 --> 01:56:05,958
know its name.

1602
01:56:05,958 --> 01:56:14,819
TRAVIS: (sighs) Fucking pussy. We have a chance to
save this city now.

1603
01:56:14,819 --> 01:56:24,388
TALIESIN: We have a chance to stop anything worse
from happening, or we have a chance to unleash

1604
01:56:24,388 --> 01:56:26,801
something far worse on it.

1605
01:56:26,801 --> 01:56:31,330
LIAM: Grog, know your strengths, it is your
strength--

1606
01:56:31,330 --> 01:56:33,398
TALIESIN: I am a betting man, and this is a bad bet.

1607
01:56:33,398 --> 01:56:36,838
TRAVIS: Can I walk up to the shadow table?

1608
01:56:36,838 --> 01:56:38,698
MATT: Yeah, yeah.

1609
01:56:38,698 --> 01:56:42,384
TRAVIS: Can I start looking around it? Do I see
anything?

1610
01:56:42,384 --> 01:56:47,702
MATT: It looks like there's the dark spot on the
table, and as you reach your hand out, it's just a

1611
01:56:47,702 --> 01:56:49,290
solid table.

1612
01:56:49,290 --> 01:56:53,760
LIAM: I look at Percival. We need to talk to the
girls.

1613
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:57,944
MATT: And as you reach your hand past that into
the shadow, because I assume that this is the--

1614
01:56:57,978 --> 01:57:00,760
TALIESIN: You know exactly what I did. Is he
reaching or is he--

1615
01:57:00,760 --> 01:57:05,798
TRAVIS: I did not reach, I'm looking on top of it,
on the sides, underneath.

1616
01:57:05,798 --> 01:57:12,003
MATT: Yeah, currently it looks like literally
where the cloth and skull once were, there is a dark

1617
01:57:12,003 --> 01:57:13,545
spot and shadow.

1618
01:57:13,601 --> 01:57:15,305
TRAVIS: No button, no latches, no holes for
quarters?

1619
01:57:15,305 --> 01:57:16,723
MATT: Nope.

1620
01:57:16,723 --> 01:57:20,697
LAURA: I'm knocking on the door.

1621
01:57:20,697 --> 01:57:25,483
TALIESIN: Your plan is good. It just requires a
little bit more study. It's a good plan.

1622
01:57:25,483 --> 01:57:26,725
TRAVIS: Study.

1623
01:57:26,725 --> 01:57:28,078
LAURA: Are you in there?

1624
01:57:28,078 --> 01:57:30,203
TALIESIN: Yes, come, please come in.

1625
01:57:30,203 --> 01:57:31,585
LAURA: I open the door.

1626
01:57:31,585 --> 01:57:33,585
MATT: Unlocked, Vex walks in.

1627
01:57:33,585 --> 01:57:38,243
LAURA: Well, what's this big master plan you're
all plotting?

1628
01:57:38,243 --> 01:57:43,984
TALIESIN: Vex. Vax, do you want to-- Well,
actually, we might as well get Keyleth down here

1629
01:57:43,984 --> 01:57:45,185
as well.

1630
01:57:45,185 --> 01:57:46,321
LIAM: Pike as well.

1631
01:57:46,321 --> 01:57:55,340
TALIESIN: Pike, Keyleth, meet me in my-- I'm going
to walk and attempt to gently scoop the skull up

1632
01:57:55,340 --> 01:57:58,489
and put it behind me.

1633
01:57:58,489 --> 01:57:59,843
MATT: Okay.

1634
01:57:59,843 --> 01:58:02,168
LIAM: To catch things up, I walk out the door and
I'm going to get the other two.

1635
01:58:02,168 --> 01:58:04,388
LAURA: Did I notice that, I have a really good passive
perception?

1636
01:58:04,388 --> 01:58:08,632
MATT: You do, you see him scoot go over to the
table and move something behind his back.

1637
01:58:08,632 --> 01:58:10,482
TRAVIS: Who did?

1638
01:58:10,482 --> 01:58:13,594
(laughter)

1639
01:58:13,594 --> 01:58:21,519
MATT: You don't know. You head up to the main
foyer area where the stairs come up through the armory

1640
01:58:21,519 --> 01:58:27,582
and lead into to the main hallway that bisects the
center of the main floor, just as Keyleth and Pike

1641
01:58:27,582 --> 01:58:30,528
are coming out of the temple after being
summoned.

1642
01:58:30,528 --> 01:58:36,957
LIAM: All right, I beeline right up to them and I
drop down in front of Pike. Pike. Keyleth. We're

1643
01:58:36,957 --> 01:58:50,246
working on a plan, and we don't have one yet, but
Pike-- and I'm down on my knee-- you need to guide

1644
01:58:50,246 --> 01:58:55,484
Grog. He doesn't listen to anyone else, he only
listens to you.

1645
01:58:55,484 --> 01:58:57,397
MARISHA: Is something wrong?

1646
01:58:57,397 --> 01:59:04,780
LIAM: Yes and no. It's better if you just come. Pike,
come.

1647
01:59:04,780 --> 01:59:06,500
ASHLEY and MARISHA: Okay.

1648
01:59:06,500 --> 01:59:08,443
LIAM: And I take Keyleth's hand and pull her after
me.

1649
01:59:08,443 --> 01:59:10,290
TRAVIS: Who's in the room right now?

1650
01:59:10,290 --> 01:59:13,456
MATT: Right now it's just you, Percy, and Vex.

1651
01:59:13,456 --> 01:59:15,397
TRAVIS: I shut the door.

1652
01:59:15,397 --> 01:59:18,712
MATT: Okay. Grog walks over and closes the door.

1653
01:59:18,712 --> 01:59:21,344
TRAVIS: I want that skull. I want it now.

1654
01:59:21,344 --> 01:59:23,268
LAURA: This is about the skull, then?

1655
01:59:23,268 --> 01:59:25,723
TRAVIS: Yeah. Percy's trying to do some fucked-up
shit with the skull.

1656
01:59:25,723 --> 01:59:27,737
MARISHA: Wait, did you close the door?

1657
01:59:27,737 --> 01:59:29,050
TRAVIS: I did.

1658
01:59:29,050 --> 01:59:33,394
MATT: You guys aren't there yet. This hasn't
happened yet, you guys are still walking down the stairs.

1659
01:59:33,394 --> 01:59:35,585
TALIESIN: He can't lock it.

1660
01:59:35,585 --> 01:59:39,113
TRAVIS: No, but I can stand in front of it. I want
the skull, right now.

1661
01:59:39,113 --> 01:59:40,578
TALIESIN: Let me see your sword.

1662
01:59:40,578 --> 01:59:42,913
TRAVIS: No, you don't want to see the sword.

1663
01:59:42,913 --> 01:59:44,726
LAURA: Oh shit.

1664
01:59:44,726 --> 01:59:54,082
TALIESIN: I point at the table and I say: reach
into the shadow and see if you can take the skull.

1665
01:59:54,082 --> 01:59:58,468
TRAVIS: No, I don't think so, your water fucked me
up last time. You get it out of the table.

1666
01:59:58,468 --> 02:00:02,719
LAURA: Can I insight check them to see who is
fucking with who--

1667
02:00:02,719 --> 02:00:03,890
TALIESIN: Good luck.

1668
02:00:03,890 --> 02:00:05,938
LAURA: -- and who has better intentions right
now?

1669
02:00:05,938 --> 02:00:07,026
MATT: Sure.

1670
02:00:07,026 --> 02:00:14,581
LAURA: Double insight check? Okay, the gold one is
for Percy, and the thorny one is for Grog.

1671
02:00:14,581 --> 02:00:15,987
LIAM: Naturally.

1672
02:00:15,987 --> 02:00:27,514
LAURA: Whoa! Good for both of them, motherfucker!
The gold one is a 27 for Percy and-- 15 plus

1673
02:00:27,514 --> 02:00:30,010
eight, what is 15 plus eight?

1674
02:00:30,010 --> 02:00:32,052
LIAM: 15 plus eight is naturally 23.

1675
02:00:32,052 --> 02:00:33,640
LAURA: 23 for Grog.

1676
02:00:33,640 --> 02:00:39,354
MATT: Okay, I rolled it for both of them. Was one
of those a natural 20?

1677
02:00:39,354 --> 02:00:41,764
LAURA: No, but one of them is 27 and 23.

1678
02:00:41,764 --> 02:00:48,858
MATT: Right, 27 and 23, okay, good. Looking at them
both, they're still very guarded and you are

1679
02:00:48,858 --> 02:00:50,107
unable to really--

1680
02:00:50,107 --> 02:00:52,680
LAURA: <i>Both</i> of them? Seriously, Matt?

1681
02:00:52,680 --> 02:01:01,289
MATT: Yeah. I mean, it doesn't absolve any of your
suspicion by any means, but they're both locked in

1682
02:01:01,289 --> 02:01:08,553
this intense stare-off and you in the center of it
as you dart back and forth to try and see any

1683
02:01:08,553 --> 02:01:13,148
give, any twitch, anything that would possibly
show an ounce of what is going on in their heads.

1684
02:01:13,148 --> 02:01:15,931
It's the best poker faces you've seen on either of
them in a while.

1685
02:01:15,931 --> 02:01:17,185
LIAM: Are we at the door yet?

1686
02:01:17,185 --> 02:01:18,783
MATT: You guys are now getting to the door.

1687
02:01:18,783 --> 02:01:23,100
LIAM: Hey, big man, Trickfoot wants to talk to
you.

1688
02:01:23,100 --> 02:01:29,397
TALIESIN: I look Grog right in the eye before they
come in. I very quietly say: does your friend have

1689
02:01:29,397 --> 02:01:31,278
an opinion on the skull?

1690
02:01:31,278 --> 02:01:33,181
TRAVIS: Which friend?

1691
02:01:33,181 --> 02:01:35,303
TALIESIN: Your new friend.

1692
02:01:35,303 --> 02:01:40,218
LAURA: What the fuck? What the fuck is going on?!
What fucking friend and--

1693
02:01:40,218 --> 02:01:41,260
TRAVIS: Vex.

1694
02:01:41,260 --> 02:01:43,013
LAURA: I saw you, Percival.

1695
02:01:43,013 --> 02:01:44,334
TALIESIN: You did.

1696
02:01:44,334 --> 02:01:46,727
MARISHA: I put my ear to the door. Can I hear them
a little bit?

1697
02:01:46,727 --> 02:01:49,416
MATT: You guys can hear shouting from the other
side, but it's too thick.

1698
02:01:49,416 --> 02:01:50,875
ASHLEY: Can I try opening it?

1699
02:01:50,875 --> 02:01:53,947
MATT: Yeah, it's unlocked, and you open the door
and it stops as if there's a door stop directly

1700
02:01:53,947 --> 02:01:56,571
behind it. You feel the door slamming you in the
back, Grog.

1701
02:01:56,571 --> 02:01:58,075
TRAVIS: Okay.

1702
02:01:58,075 --> 02:02:00,953
TALIESIN: Or pick who you trust. I trust your
judgment.

1703
02:02:00,953 --> 02:02:04,136
TRAVIS: Trust? Vex, listen to me. What did you
see?

1704
02:02:04,136 --> 02:02:10,301
LAURA: Who's your friend?

1705
02:02:10,301 --> 02:02:16,618
TRAVIS: (sighs) The skull grants a wish. It can
only be used by those with dark presence around

1706
02:02:16,618 --> 02:02:23,669
them. That's Percy, that's me. How has Percy done
with dark shit in the past? I went to him for help

1707
02:02:23,669 --> 02:02:29,093
because I'm trying to free the city of these
fucking dragons, but it wanted Percy. I tried to

1708
02:02:29,093 --> 02:02:35,231
keep it for myself. And now he's up to his shady
shit all over again.

1709
02:02:35,231 --> 02:02:37,501
LAURA: It specifically wants Percy?

1710
02:02:37,501 --> 02:02:39,351
TRAVIS: It wanted Percy.

1711
02:02:39,351 --> 02:02:41,747
TALIESIN: And I said 'no.'

1712
02:02:41,747 --> 02:02:43,903
TRAVIS: The hell you did.

1713
02:02:43,903 --> 02:02:47,186
MARISHA: (yelling) Wait, who wanted who?

1714
02:02:47,186 --> 02:02:48,862
ASHLEY: Can we wiggle in?

1715
02:02:48,862 --> 02:02:53,428
MATT: You can try to, but Grog, you hold the door
shut? The door's not moving.

1716
02:02:53,428 --> 02:02:57,631
LIAM: Okay, I'm going to quick, rapid-fire-- I was
hoping to bring everybody in, but say: listen to

1717
02:02:57,631 --> 02:03:03,953
me. Percy's got this fucking skull and we--
Everything about it. It's a skull, it's talking

1718
02:03:03,953 --> 02:03:08,489
about granting a wish, it's fucking fucked up just
like the fucking smoke demon that was in Percival.

1719
02:03:08,489 --> 02:03:13,071
I don't understand what's going on yet, but both
Grog and Percival are a little fucked up, but Grog

1720
02:03:13,071 --> 02:03:16,035
is more fucked up, but I don't understand
everything. But things are not good.

1721
02:03:16,035 --> 02:03:17,495
MARISHA: What?

1722
02:03:17,495 --> 02:03:18,816
ASHLEY: What's going on?

1723
02:03:18,816 --> 02:03:25,859
MARISHA: Hearing Vax unload that information, if I
reach through the crack in the door, can I touch Grog?

1724
02:03:25,859 --> 02:03:29,261
MATT: There's just enough of a gap where you could
probably get an arm through.

1725
02:03:29,261 --> 02:03:31,103
MARISHA: Like my tiny little female hand.

1726
02:03:31,103 --> 02:03:32,899
MATT: Pike, what are you doing?

1727
02:03:32,899 --> 02:03:35,369
ASHLEY: Can I push the door open? Or at least
try?

1728
02:03:35,369 --> 02:03:37,707
MATT: Try to. Pike, make a strength check.

1729
02:03:37,707 --> 02:03:39,547
ASHLEY: Yeah, go first, go first.

1730
02:03:39,547 --> 02:03:43,786
MARISHA: I reach through, and if I can grab Grog,
I cast Hold Person on him.

1731
02:03:43,786 --> 02:03:46,188
TRAVIS: Cool, I'll stay right where I am.

1732
02:03:46,188 --> 02:03:49,020
MARISHA: Well-- Then we can push him over, right?

1733
02:03:49,020 --> 02:03:55,246
MATT: You can try, yeah. All right, so. Hold
Person: does it require--

1734
02:03:55,246 --> 02:03:57,510
TRAVIS: I weigh like 600 pounds.

1735
02:03:57,510 --> 02:04:00,497
MARISHA: There's three of us, we can push real
hard.

1736
02:04:00,497 --> 02:04:02,017
LIAM: We can get Jarett.

1737
02:04:02,017 --> 02:04:06,555
MATT: All right. So, looking at Hold Person here,
hold on just a second.

1738
02:04:06,555 --> 02:04:11,497
MARISHA: Oh, wait! Wait, can I redact that? Can I
redact that?

1739
02:04:11,497 --> 02:04:13,628
TRAVIS: No, you already said it.

1740
02:04:13,628 --> 02:04:17,866
MATT: It has to be a humanoid you can see
within range. So you couldn't even Hold Person

1741
02:04:17,866 --> 02:04:19,329
through the door.

1742
02:04:19,329 --> 02:04:22,444
MARISHA: Beautiful-- Even better.

1743
02:04:22,444 --> 02:04:24,133
TALIESIN: You read the spell, didn't you?

1744
02:04:24,133 --> 02:04:28,934
LIAM: Scanlan, Scanlan, join us. Please, quickly,
please.

1745
02:04:28,934 --> 02:04:33,252
MATT: Scanlan goes, "I'm trying to help some
folks, but if you insist, all right."

1746
02:04:33,252 --> 02:04:35,063
LIAM: I do, I do insist.

1747
02:04:35,063 --> 02:04:39,833
TRAVIS: Vex. If he has the skull, we've got to get
it from him now.

1748
02:04:39,833 --> 02:04:43,139
LAURA: Percy?

1749
02:04:43,139 --> 02:04:46,421
TALIESIN: I have the skull. I'm not going to use
it, I don't trust him not to use it, yet.

1750
02:04:46,421 --> 02:04:49,816
LAURA: How about you guys give me the skull, I'm
not even touched by anything dark.

1751
02:04:49,816 --> 02:04:51,428
TRAVIS: That's a great idea.

1752
02:04:51,428 --> 02:04:52,495
TALIESIN: That's fair.

1753
02:04:52,495 --> 02:04:53,788
TRAVIS: Yeah. Give her the skull.

1754
02:04:53,788 --> 02:04:58,010
TALIESIN: All right, I pull it out from behind me
and hand it to you. It's in the bag, wrapped in cloth.

1755
02:04:58,010 --> 02:05:04,335
LAURA: Oh god. I'm going to get fucking attacked
by Grog. I'm going to back up into a corner and

1756
02:05:04,335 --> 02:05:06,152
hold on to it and look down at it.

1757
02:05:06,152 --> 02:05:07,538
MATT: Okay.

1758
02:05:07,538 --> 02:05:09,556
LAURA: I'm holding onto it? Jesus.

1759
02:05:09,556 --> 02:05:12,521
MATT: You are holding onto it, and it's wrapped in
the tapestry that you guys threw over it

1760
02:05:12,521 --> 02:05:16,674
originally, but you can feel it in your hands, and
it's not terribly heavy, it has some heft to it,

1761
02:05:16,674 --> 02:05:20,187
and just having it there, you're already getting
pins and needles on the back of your neck.

1762
02:05:20,187 --> 02:05:21,822
LIAM: Now, Shorthalt, now.

1763
02:05:21,822 --> 02:05:26,489
MARISHA: Is he trying to bamf in? Scanlan?

1764
02:05:26,489 --> 02:05:28,787
MATT: No, no. So, Pike, what are you doing?

1765
02:05:28,787 --> 02:05:30,739
ASHLEY: I want to try and push in the door open.

1766
02:05:30,739 --> 02:05:34,536
MATT: Okay. Make a strength check. Grog, make a
strength check.

1767
02:05:34,536 --> 02:05:36,040
ASHLEY: With all my strength.

1768
02:05:36,040 --> 02:05:37,443
TALIESIN: I love you, Travis.

1769
02:05:37,443 --> 02:05:38,769
(laughter)

1770
02:05:38,769 --> 02:05:41,915
MARISHA: While she pushes, can I get up against
the crack to see if I can see through while she pushes?

1771
02:05:41,915 --> 02:05:43,350
TRAVIS: 17.

1772
02:05:43,350 --> 02:05:44,714
ASHLEY: Eight.

1773
02:05:44,714 --> 02:05:49,453
MATT: The door lurches, but you hold it solidly in
place. You can feel--

1774
02:05:49,453 --> 02:05:50,992
ASHLEY: Grog! Let me in!

1775
02:05:50,992 --> 02:05:52,870
TRAVIS: Just a fuck-- just a minute!

1776
02:05:52,870 --> 02:05:54,963
ASHLEY: I've been waiting five minutes!

1777
02:05:54,963 --> 02:05:57,922
(laughter)

1778
02:05:57,922 --> 02:06:00,014
TALIESIN: Put your pants on, Grog, really.

1779
02:06:00,014 --> 02:06:02,035
LIAM: Just another minute, mom.

1780
02:06:02,035 --> 02:06:06,490
LAURA: I think this is probably the stupidest
thing, why did I decide to hold it?

1781
02:06:06,490 --> 02:06:10,064
TRAVIS: Give me the skull, you don't want Percy to
have it.

1782
02:06:10,064 --> 02:06:13,215
LAURA: I don't want either of you to have it.

1783
02:06:13,215 --> 02:06:15,640
TALIESIN: Don't give me the skull, but don't give
him the skull either.

1784
02:06:15,640 --> 02:06:19,385
TRAVIS: If you want to, you can ask it what it
wants, and then you'll know, or you can give it to

1785
02:06:19,385 --> 02:06:21,049
me and we can be done with this.

1786
02:06:21,049 --> 02:06:23,353
MARISHA: Are we trying to hand Grog the evil
things?

1787
02:06:23,353 --> 02:06:26,891
LAURA: I take the tapestry off it and I ask it,
what the fuck do you want? What the fuck are you?

1788
02:06:26,891 --> 02:06:28,404
What the fuck is this?

1789
02:06:28,404 --> 02:06:31,139
MATT: As you look down at the skull, which you
guys still can't get through because Grog's

1790
02:06:31,139 --> 02:06:33,910
holding the door, and you don't have a visual in
there because he's holding it pretty close to

1791
02:06:33,910 --> 02:06:38,798
completely shut. As you look down, you can see now
in the gem, formulating in the middle of it, this

1792
02:06:38,798 --> 02:06:44,348
swirl of a face that comes right up to the front.
You can see in the midst of its coloration

1793
02:06:44,348 --> 02:06:55,775
these energy-based eyes and grin, a toothy grin
that goes, "I wish to be freed. That is all. I've

1794
02:06:55,775 --> 02:07:01,767
"been here far too long. I grow tired. I want to
finally pass."

1795
02:07:01,767 --> 02:07:04,299
LAURA: Are you Vecna?

1796
02:07:04,299 --> 02:07:13,994
MATT: You hear a chuckle. "No. Vecna has been long
gone. I am not a being of such power."

1797
02:07:13,994 --> 02:07:20,551
LAURA: Can I insight check the fucking thing in
the eyeball?

1798
02:07:20,551 --> 02:07:22,663
MATT: Sure, make a insight check.

1799
02:07:22,663 --> 02:07:31,615
LAURA: Sure, no problem. Unless it was a natural
20, it doesn't matter, 15, no.

1800
02:07:31,615 --> 02:07:33,514
MATT: 15, you don't.

1801
02:07:33,514 --> 02:07:36,436
LAURA: No. Way higher than 15, 21.

1802
02:07:36,436 --> 02:07:38,299
MATT: Okay. 21, thank you.

1803
02:07:38,299 --> 02:07:43,081
LAURA: 22, I can add.

1804
02:07:43,081 --> 02:07:52,144
MATT: 22, okay, that's way higher. You take a look
at it, but due to the fact that it's mostly

1805
02:07:52,144 --> 02:07:56,565
hidden, there aren't facial tics and there aren't
normal gives to what a person's intent is, and

1806
02:07:56,565 --> 02:08:02,021
even the tone of voice itself is spectral, ominous
and otherworldly. You have a hard time being able

1807
02:08:02,021 --> 02:08:06,361
to read whether or not it's being honest or lying
or anything in between.

1808
02:08:06,361 --> 02:08:07,641
LIAM: Scanlan here yet?

1809
02:08:07,641 --> 02:08:08,788
LAURA: Why would we free it?

1810
02:08:08,788 --> 02:08:11,398
MATT: Scanlan is now behind the door on the other
side, and he enters the room with you guys and is

1811
02:08:11,398 --> 02:08:13,124
like, "What's going on, everything cool?"

1812
02:08:13,124 --> 02:08:14,277
LIAM: Wait, the door is open now?

1813
02:08:14,277 --> 02:08:15,763
MATT: No, he's with you guys.

1814
02:08:15,763 --> 02:08:17,847
LIAM: Ah good, yeah, Bigby that shit.

1815
02:08:17,847 --> 02:08:19,131
TRAVIS: I bum rush Vex.

1816
02:08:19,131 --> 02:08:21,107
ASHLEY: No, Dimension Door me in, please.

1817
02:08:21,107 --> 02:08:22,850
TALIESIN: I think we need a name for the
thing.

1818
02:08:22,850 --> 02:08:25,191
TRAVIS: I bum rush Vex.

1819
02:08:25,191 --> 02:08:28,633
TALIESIN: I'm using quick draw.

1820
02:08:28,633 --> 02:08:30,262
MARISHA: What?

1821
02:08:30,262 --> 02:08:32,149
MATT: Initiative rolls from both of you guys.

1822
02:08:32,149 --> 02:08:33,610
TALIESIN: Yeah!

1823
02:08:33,610 --> 02:08:35,710
MARISHA: Does this mean the door flies open?

1824
02:08:35,710 --> 02:08:37,103
ASHLEY: Yeah, the door flies open.

1825
02:08:37,103 --> 02:08:38,714
MATT: Just a moment.

1826
02:08:38,714 --> 02:08:40,991
LIAM: This is all seconds, this is happening in
seconds.

1827
02:08:40,991 --> 02:08:41,955
TRAVIS: 14.

1828
02:08:41,955 --> 02:08:44,127
LAURA: Do I roll anything? Can I do anything?

1829
02:08:44,127 --> 02:08:45,793
TALIESIN: 28.

1830
02:08:45,793 --> 02:08:47,722
TRAVIS: Ugh, Jesus. 28?!

1831
02:08:47,722 --> 02:08:51,156
MATT: I'll say roll with disadvantage, because it
catches you entirely off-guard.

1832
02:08:51,156 --> 02:08:57,471
LAURA: So this is a surprise attack. Ugh, that's
lame. That was just 13.

1833
02:08:57,471 --> 02:08:59,520
MATT: Okay, and you had a--?

1834
02:08:59,520 --> 02:09:00,610
TRAVIS: 14.

1835
02:09:00,610 --> 02:09:07,758
MATT: 14, okay. All right, so, you see Grog lower
his head and then go for a burst run across the

1836
02:09:07,758 --> 02:09:12,879
length of the workshop towards Vex. You
instinctually go quick draw, what are you doing?

1837
02:09:12,879 --> 02:09:22,233
TALIESIN: I'm shooting a warning shot past his
head, diving in, taking the--

1838
02:09:22,233 --> 02:09:25,138
LAURA: Are you close enough? I backed into a
corner.

1839
02:09:25,138 --> 02:09:28,525
TALIESIN: I've got six spaces of movement in my
turn.

1840
02:09:28,525 --> 02:09:29,997
MATT: Yeah, it's not a big room.

1841
02:09:29,997 --> 02:09:32,313
TALIESIN: Diving and grabbing the head and curling
back around--

1842
02:09:32,313 --> 02:09:34,016
TRAVIS: The head? The skull?

1843
02:09:34,016 --> 02:09:35,487
TALIESIN: Grabbing the skull and going--

1844
02:09:35,487 --> 02:09:36,852
TRAVIS: She's 50/50 distance between us.

1845
02:09:36,852 --> 02:09:38,568
TALIESIN: I'm moving first.

1846
02:09:38,568 --> 02:09:40,857
MATT: Okay.

1847
02:09:40,857 --> 02:09:44,619
TALIESIN: And I'm happy to spend an action surge
if that'll make this work better.

1848
02:09:44,619 --> 02:09:46,157
LAURA: Do you think you can just grab it from me?

1849
02:09:46,157 --> 02:09:47,343
LIAM: D&amp;D standoff.

1850
02:09:47,343 --> 02:09:48,492
TALIESIN: I can make a roll for it.

1851
02:09:48,492 --> 02:09:52,447
MATT: So, as you dart, Percy is waiting for
someone to also dart, and both of you go rushing

1852
02:09:52,447 --> 02:09:58,991
across the room. Percy manages to get there a
fraction of a second before you do. You hear the

1853
02:09:58,991 --> 02:10:03,991
blast of his pistol past your ear, and the ringing
hits the center of your head, but you still

1854
02:10:03,991 --> 02:10:08,882
continue pushing forward in the way that Grog
does, ignoring all outside interference. However,

1855
02:10:08,882 --> 02:10:11,298
you've gotten to the skull first. Are you going to
attempt to wrestle it from her?

1856
02:10:11,298 --> 02:10:15,217
TALIESIN: Gently pull it out of his run. So I'm
going pull it--

1857
02:10:15,217 --> 02:10:18,112
LAURA: Are you going to try to pull me out of the
way or just the fucking skull, you dick?

1858
02:10:18,112 --> 02:10:19,947
MATT: She's pretty grappled to it.

1859
02:10:19,947 --> 02:10:24,399
TALIESIN: Oh, if she's that grappled to it, then
I'm going to try and push her out of the way of Grog.

1860
02:10:24,399 --> 02:10:26,334
MATT: Okay, opposed strength checks from both of you.

1861
02:10:26,334 --> 02:10:27,771
LAURA: From me?

1862
02:10:27,771 --> 02:10:29,398
MATT: Yeah, make a strength check.

1863
02:10:29,398 --> 02:10:30,968
TRAVIS: He doesn't seem to care much.

1864
02:10:30,968 --> 02:10:32,948
LAURA: He really, really doesn't.

1865
02:10:32,948 --> 02:10:34,807
TALIESIN: 15.

1866
02:10:34,807 --> 02:10:37,708
LAURA: Ah, that's terrible-- nine.

1867
02:10:37,708 --> 02:10:41,014
TALIESIN: It's less of a shove and more of a pull
out of the way of Grog's rush.

1868
02:10:41,014 --> 02:10:44,782
MATT: Right, so, he reaches over and grabs the
skull in your arm and pulls you--

1869
02:10:44,782 --> 02:10:46,331
TALIESIN: Well, I grab her.

1870
02:10:46,331 --> 02:10:50,857
MATT: Right, she-- but you haven't pulled it from her
grip, you pull her out of the way. Shoves you

1871
02:10:50,857 --> 02:10:54,375
to the side. You go rushing forward, and as you
get there, she is pulled to the side, she is still

1872
02:10:54,546 --> 02:10:59,511
right there in front of you, but the bum rush
didn't get you there before anybody could react.

1873
02:10:59,511 --> 02:11:01,545
So now it's your turn.

1874
02:11:01,545 --> 02:11:03,241
LAURA: It's my turn?

1875
02:11:03,241 --> 02:11:05,494
MATT: Yeah. Wait, you rolled a 13?

1876
02:11:05,494 --> 02:11:06,503
LAURA: I rolled a 13.

1877
02:11:06,503 --> 02:11:11,688
MATT: Oh, never mind, Grog goes next. Grog, so you
rush up and you can now see Percy, pistol out,

1878
02:11:11,688 --> 02:11:17,486
hand on the side of Vex, off the side of her arm.
She's holding the skull there and they're both

1879
02:11:17,486 --> 02:11:20,458
looking at you expectantly. What are you doing to
do?

1880
02:11:20,458 --> 02:11:22,406
TRAVIS: I want Percy. I'm going to tackle Percy.

1881
02:11:22,406 --> 02:11:23,409
MATT: You what?

1882
02:11:23,409 --> 02:11:25,657
TRAVIS: I am going to run straight towards Percy
and tackle him.

1883
02:11:25,657 --> 02:11:31,942
MATT: Tackle him, okay, all right. So, let's get
some proper rumble music for this.

1884
02:11:31,942 --> 02:11:36,472
MARISHA: There are dragons outside and we're
fighting, playing rugby with a fucking skull.

1885
02:11:36,472 --> 02:11:38,356
TRAVIS: I'm trying to fix the dragons.

1886
02:11:38,356 --> 02:11:41,917
MATT: Okay, so you use the momentum of the rush
and you see him do this, you turn out of the way

1887
02:11:41,917 --> 02:11:47,567
and go for a shoulder shove. I want you to go
ahead and make an attack roll. Actually, make an

1888
02:11:47,567 --> 02:11:50,974
athletics roll versus your acrobatics.

1889
02:11:50,974 --> 02:11:56,999
TRAVIS: Why can't that be higher? 19.

1890
02:11:56,999 --> 02:11:58,792
TALIESIN: Ah shit, 14.

1891
02:11:58,792 --> 02:12:04,379
MATT: 14, I need you to go ahead and make a
strength saving throw.

1892
02:12:04,379 --> 02:12:10,489
TALIESIN: Oh shit. 17, oh, saving throw. 21.

1893
02:12:10,489 --> 02:12:21,359
MATT: 21. You slam into him and you essentially
shove him with the shoulder. You manage to knock

1894
02:12:21,359 --> 02:12:27,104
him prone, but the skull doesn't come loose, he
loses his grip on it, and currently Vex is still

1895
02:12:27,104 --> 02:12:31,081
holding it front of you. You're prone on the
ground.

1896
02:12:31,081 --> 02:12:32,543
TALIESIN: I'm prone on the ground?

1897
02:12:32,543 --> 02:12:33,789
TRAVIS: So Vex still has it?

1898
02:12:33,789 --> 02:12:34,954
TALIESIN: But it's Vex's turn.

1899
02:12:34,954 --> 02:12:36,830
TRAVIS: But I knocked him off of her. But you've
still got the skull.

1900
02:12:36,830 --> 02:12:40,125
TALIESIN: I wasn't trying to wrestle it.

1901
02:12:40,125 --> 02:12:42,236
MATT: Anything else you want to try and
accomplish?

1902
02:12:42,236 --> 02:12:44,718
TRAVIS: Yeah, I would like to turn and put my back
to Vex, because she has the skull.

1903
02:12:44,718 --> 02:12:49,204
MATT: Okay. So you go and plant a protective position
in front of her? It's now your turn. Grog, who

1904
02:12:49,204 --> 02:12:53,262
rushes over and shoulder slams Percy out of the
way, and he's fallen to the ground. His gun almost

1905
02:12:53,262 --> 02:12:57,572
scatters to the floor of the workshop around you.
As you're expecting, he turns towards you, instead

1906
02:12:57,572 --> 02:13:04,511
he steps and his giant frame is now blocking you
with the shoulder blades in front, his arms out in

1907
02:13:04,511 --> 02:13:08,117
a defensive position, facing off with people as
they begin to enter the room. What are you going

1908
02:13:08,117 --> 02:13:09,234
to do?

1909
02:13:09,234 --> 02:13:16,117
LAURA: I reach up and I touch his back. And I say:
are you yourself?

1910
02:13:16,117 --> 02:13:17,423
TRAVIS: Me?

1911
02:13:17,423 --> 02:13:18,838
LAURA: Yes, you, fuck!

1912
02:13:18,838 --> 02:13:20,935
TRAVIS: Yeah, yes, fuck, it's me.

1913
02:13:20,935 --> 02:13:35,017
LAURA: I back up into a corner, and I say: what is
all this about? Why do you even need this? Why do

1914
02:13:35,017 --> 02:13:37,236
we want to set it free? I don't understand.

1915
02:13:37,236 --> 02:13:39,603
TRAVIS: We don't, we don't, we just don't want him
to have Percy.

1916
02:13:39,603 --> 02:13:41,887
MARISHA: The rest of us see this now, right?

1917
02:13:41,887 --> 02:13:44,663
MATT: At this point now, the door's burst open,
and the rest of you guys rush in and you can see

1918
02:13:44,663 --> 02:13:49,818
Percy just as he hits the ground. You can see Grog
recovering from the shoulder slam, who then steps

1919
02:13:49,818 --> 02:13:54,503
in front of Vex with this snarl on his face and
begins shouting to her over his shoulder, and you

1920
02:13:54,503 --> 02:13:55,991
hear them talking across the room.

1921
02:13:55,991 --> 02:13:59,670
TALIESIN: It doesn't want me, I don't want to use
the skull. I want to keep you from using it.

1922
02:13:59,670 --> 02:14:01,827
ASHLEY: What is going on in here?!

1923
02:14:01,827 --> 02:14:09,442
MARISHA: Keyleth cracks her staff on the floor and
does a Gust cantrip and goes (whoosh) to make a

1924
02:14:09,442 --> 02:14:10,765
big burst of wind in the room.

1925
02:14:10,765 --> 02:14:15,381
MATT: Okay. Tools go falling off the wall and
clattering to the stone floor of the

1926
02:14:15,381 --> 02:14:21,102
establishment. All of you who have hair have it
blown and wrapped around you. You are pushed back

1927
02:14:21,102 --> 02:14:24,866
about three inches from the burst of it, and all
of you, immediately, your attention goes to

1928
02:14:24,866 --> 02:14:26,517
Keyleth who stands there with her staff.

1929
02:14:26,517 --> 02:14:28,176
TRAVIS: Is it dusty in there now? Or is it just
windy?

1930
02:14:28,176 --> 02:14:32,162
MATT: It's not dusty, it's covered in layers of
soot that have now been kicked up, and the air

1931
02:14:32,162 --> 02:14:35,419
itself is a temporary fume.

1932
02:14:35,419 --> 02:14:37,800
TRAVIS: Do we have an order?

1933
02:14:37,800 --> 02:14:39,257
MARISHA: Silence!

1934
02:14:39,257 --> 02:14:41,820
MATT: She does that. Pike, what are you doing?

1935
02:14:41,820 --> 02:14:47,518
ASHLEY: Can I insight-check Grog?

1936
02:14:47,518 --> 02:14:54,596
MATT: Yeah, go for it.

1937
02:14:54,596 --> 02:14:57,626
ASHLEY: 21.

1938
02:14:57,626 --> 02:14:59,950
MATT: What are you trying to know?

1939
02:14:59,950 --> 02:15:03,483
TRAVIS: What are you trying to know?

1940
02:15:03,483 --> 02:15:09,459
ASHLEY: I want to know why he wants this skull so
bad.

1941
02:15:09,583 --> 02:15:20,563
MATT: Okay. If you would like to relay any
information, she peered pretty well into your

1942
02:15:20,563 --> 02:15:22,125
demeanor.

1943
02:15:22,125 --> 02:15:25,234
TRAVIS: I want to get rid of the dragons, now.

1944
02:15:25,234 --> 02:15:36,455
MATT: So you gather that he's coming from a place
that a simple mind is looking for a simple

1945
02:15:36,455 --> 02:15:39,237
solution to a complex problem.

1946
02:15:39,237 --> 02:15:42,657
(laughter)

1947
02:15:42,657 --> 02:15:46,323
LAURA: "I'm right here, Matt."

1948
02:15:46,323 --> 02:15:48,529
TALIESIN: Burn, burn!

1949
02:15:48,529 --> 02:15:52,326
TRAVIS: Oh, oh, the flames, ah!

1950
02:15:52,326 --> 02:15:54,683
(laughter)

1951
02:15:54,683 --> 02:15:56,536
TRAVIS: Stop, drop, and roll!

1952
02:15:56,536 --> 02:16:04,226
MATT: I'm saying that's the best way she can
discern your demeanor right now. Pike, anything

1953
02:16:04,226 --> 02:16:07,184
else you want to do right now? We have to continue
this.

1954
02:16:07,184 --> 02:16:16,580
ASHLEY: Yep. Can I walk over and grab Craven
Edge?

1955
02:16:16,580 --> 02:16:22,069
MATT: Craven Edge is currently sheathed on his
back, away from you. So you can attempt to, if you

1956
02:16:22,069 --> 02:16:23,539
want to.

1957
02:16:23,539 --> 02:16:26,990
ASHLEY: Grog, can you give me Craven Edge,
please?

1958
02:16:26,990 --> 02:16:30,886
MATT: Pike, hands out to you and looking you
earnestly in the face.

1959
02:16:30,886 --> 02:16:32,989
TRAVIS: Why?

1960
02:16:32,989 --> 02:16:35,353
ASHLEY: I just want to look at it.

1961
02:16:35,353 --> 02:16:39,767
MARISHA: Pike, you sure about this?

1962
02:16:39,767 --> 02:16:44,551
ASHLEY: I just want to see, something's not quite
right.

1963
02:16:44,551 --> 02:16:51,709
TALIESIN: Can I get up at this point or no?

1964
02:16:51,709 --> 02:16:57,822
MATT: We are about to get back to the top of the
round. So you do what you're doing, okay. Percy.

1965
02:16:57,822 --> 02:17:08,277
TALIESIN: I'm going to stand up and grab a poker
off the table. I'm leaving my gun on the floor.

1966
02:17:08,277 --> 02:17:11,882
MATT: Not off the table, the wind gust knocked off
a lot of these things on the ground. Small pile of

1967
02:17:11,882 --> 02:17:13,886
tools next to you. So you grab the poker.

1968
02:17:13,886 --> 02:17:16,705
TALIESIN: I grab a poker and I take a corner.

1969
02:17:16,705 --> 02:17:21,248
MATT: Okay. So now, Percy, you've squared off into
a corner, there's Vex in the other corner, Grog's

1970
02:17:21,248 --> 02:17:25,824
standing in between the two with the back against
Vex. The three of you are right there at the

1971
02:17:25,824 --> 02:17:32,380
front. Pike has stepped up to Grog now and is
beseeching him. That's Percy. Grog, you're up.

1972
02:17:32,380 --> 02:17:39,073
TRAVIS: I look at Pike. I turn around, I look at
Vex. You'll thank me. And I'd like to try and pull

1973
02:17:39,073 --> 02:17:41,450
the skull out of her hands.

1974
02:17:41,450 --> 02:17:47,065
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a strength check
against her.

1975
02:17:47,065 --> 02:17:54,440
LAURA: Oh jeez, oh come on. There's no way, even
if I roll like a-- Unless I get a 20.

1976
02:17:54,440 --> 02:17:55,910
TRAVIS: 21.

1977
02:17:55,910 --> 02:18:00,305
LAURA: No, that's 14.

1978
02:18:00,305 --> 02:18:08,273
MATT: All right. As Grog turns around and gives
you almost an apologetic look, his face steels

1979
02:18:08,273 --> 02:18:15,376
over with intensity as, lightning-fast, his
muscular arms rush out in front, grasp the skull.

1980
02:18:15,376 --> 02:18:22,235
Like tearing a toy from a child's grasp, it is
removed from you with barely any sort of

1981
02:18:22,235 --> 02:18:24,132
resistance.

1982
02:18:24,132 --> 02:18:26,275
MARISHA: Can I get a spell off on him?

1983
02:18:26,275 --> 02:18:31,894
MATT: Not yet. So Grog, that's your action. You
grab and you have now the skull. You left her with

1984
02:18:31,894 --> 02:18:35,081
the tapestry, like you have just the bare skull in
front of you.

1985
02:18:35,081 --> 02:18:38,614
TRAVIS: What would I like to do with it?

1986
02:18:38,614 --> 02:18:42,154
MATT: You have a bonus action, so depends on what
you're trying to accomplish.

1987
02:18:42,154 --> 02:18:43,950
TRAVIS: Can I spike it?

1988
02:18:43,950 --> 02:18:46,229
MATT: You can, yeah, I'd say yeah.

1989
02:18:46,229 --> 02:18:48,086
TALIESIN: That's a bonus action?

1990
02:18:48,086 --> 02:18:52,265
MATT: I'd say this would be your movement and
bonus, I'll let you do that, the whole thing

1991
02:18:52,265 --> 02:18:53,428
together.

1992
02:18:53,428 --> 02:18:55,398
TRAVIS: I would like to spike the skull.

1993
02:18:55,398 --> 02:18:56,661
TALIESIN: Oh Jesus.

1994
02:18:56,661 --> 02:18:59,598
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a strength check.

1995
02:18:59,598 --> 02:19:01,786
LAURA: You're just going to--

1996
02:19:01,786 --> 02:19:04,798
TRAVIS: What are the fucking chances?!

1997
02:19:04,798 --> 02:19:06,263
MATT: A natural one?

1998
02:19:06,263 --> 02:19:07,149
LAURA: Yes.

1999
02:19:07,149 --> 02:19:10,048
(laughter)

2000
02:19:10,048 --> 02:19:14,477
MATT: As you reach up, at the apex of your throw
you look down and--

2001
02:19:14,477 --> 02:19:16,791
TRAVIS: I don't believe it. I don't fucking believe it.

2002
02:19:16,791 --> 02:19:24,528
MATT: Your eyes catch Pike, and during that brief
moment of slow-motion as you reach up, you see her

2003
02:19:24,528 --> 02:19:36,324
face, this look of complete, heartbreaking
disappointment. Just like that. It shakes you in a

2004
02:19:36,324 --> 02:19:41,095
way that you didn't expect, and as you go through
the motion you already anticipated, and your

2005
02:19:41,095 --> 02:19:47,638
brain's already wandered in doing so. You slam it
half-heartedly and it bounces and skids across the

2006
02:19:47,638 --> 02:19:49,752
ground, over by where Keyleth is.

2007
02:19:49,752 --> 02:19:53,376
MARISHA: Is it rolling at my feet?

2008
02:19:53,376 --> 02:19:55,107
LAURA: I run and jump for it.

2009
02:19:55,107 --> 02:20:00,635
MATT: All right, so. It's not your turn, it's the
end of your turn. As it goes rolling, you run and

2010
02:20:00,635 --> 02:20:04,926
dodge, go ahead and make an acrobatics check.

2011
02:20:04,926 --> 02:20:06,947
LIAM: Damn it.

2012
02:20:06,947 --> 02:20:08,285
LAURA: 23.

2013
02:20:08,285 --> 02:20:16,445
MATT: 23, all right. You jump out of the way,
tumble, roll, and scoop up it in your arms once

2014
02:20:16,445 --> 02:20:18,052
more, and you have it.

2015
02:20:18,052 --> 02:20:19,552
MARISHA: Can I get a spell off?

2016
02:20:19,552 --> 02:20:22,205
MATT: You have to get to your turn. Is that all
you're going to do?

2017
02:20:22,205 --> 02:20:30,480
LAURA: That was all of it? Can I run out of the
room? If I can move. I'm going to run towards the door.

2018
02:20:30,480 --> 02:20:33,626
MATT: I'd say, yeah. With the tumble and
everything, you have just enough movement to get

2019
02:20:33,626 --> 02:20:38,537
out of the room. So Vex goes darting out of the
workshop, just past the door, leaving the room.

2020
02:20:38,537 --> 02:20:42,379
That brings us now to--

2021
02:20:42,379 --> 02:20:49,586
LIAM: Relay race. Okay, then I take a step in
front of her and pull out my daggers and stand in

2022
02:20:49,586 --> 02:20:51,136
front of my sister.

2023
02:20:51,136 --> 02:20:52,564
MATT: Okay.

2024
02:20:52,564 --> 02:21:00,704
MARISHA: What the fuck is happening? Seeing all of
this happen, I cast Hold Person.

2025
02:21:00,704 --> 02:21:02,699
TRAVIS: Stop trying to protect the skull.

2026
02:21:02,699 --> 02:21:04,253
MARISHA: At 4th-level.

2027
02:21:04,253 --> 02:21:05,501
MATT: To? Against?

2028
02:21:05,501 --> 02:21:08,574
MARISHA: Against Percy, Grog--

2029
02:21:08,574 --> 02:21:12,849
LAURA: I'm out of the room, you can't see me.

2030
02:21:12,849 --> 02:21:14,376
LIAM: I'm in.

2031
02:21:14,376 --> 02:21:16,144
MARISHA: How far away are they? Can I turn around
and see--

2032
02:21:16,144 --> 02:21:20,388
MATT: I'd say she just got out of the room, you
would have visual on her as she's leaving the

2033
02:21:20,388 --> 02:21:21,610
room, yeah.

2034
02:21:21,610 --> 02:21:22,850
MARISHA: What about Vax?

2035
02:21:22,850 --> 02:21:27,016
MATT: Yeah, Vax is standing in front of her, you
have visual on both, technically.

2036
02:21:27,016 --> 02:21:29,803
TRAVIS: Don't do this.

2037
02:21:29,803 --> 02:21:33,127
LIAM: This is so metal.

2038
02:21:33,127 --> 02:21:37,819
MARISHA: Vex. Vex. Sorry, Vex.

2039
02:21:37,819 --> 02:21:40,771
MATT: All right, I need a wisdom saving throw from
all three of you.

2040
02:21:40,771 --> 02:21:42,285
LIAM: Wait, me too?

2041
02:21:42,285 --> 02:21:46,239
LAURA: No, just me. Yeah, you fucks are still
mobile.

2042
02:21:46,239 --> 02:21:47,972
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

2043
02:21:47,972 --> 02:21:49,787
MATT: Boom, Percy?

2044
02:21:49,787 --> 02:21:54,075
TALIESIN: 15.

2045
02:21:54,075 --> 02:21:55,613
MATT: 15, that's a failure.

2046
02:21:55,613 --> 02:21:56,779
LAURA: 21.

2047
02:21:56,779 --> 02:22:01,598
MATT: So Percy, your muscles tense up, and as
you're holding your poker, you find yourself

2048
02:22:01,598 --> 02:22:06,379
unable to move. Grog, you feel and look over and
see Keyleth as she looks towards you with intensity,

2049
02:22:06,379 --> 02:22:10,057
and you feel a similar tremor across your head,
but you shrug it off.

2050
02:22:10,057 --> 02:22:11,717
TRAVIS: These fucking sensations today.

2051
02:22:11,717 --> 02:22:17,084
MATT: Yeah, it's weird. Vex, you as well, you
glance over your shoulder as you hear Keyleth

2052
02:22:17,084 --> 02:22:22,058
muttering under her breath, and you can feel that
familiar sensation of the magical attempt to grasp

2053
02:22:22,058 --> 02:22:27,576
your mind. Your half-elven self makes it even
easier to shrug off, and you continue darting

2054
02:22:27,576 --> 02:22:30,773
forth the direction you are with your brother
behind you. So you're protecting her?

2055
02:22:30,773 --> 02:22:32,591
LIAM: Oh yes, I'm barring the way

2056
02:22:32,591 --> 02:22:35,536
LAURA: So we're right up the hallway from our
prison cell, right?

2057
02:22:35,536 --> 02:22:40,328
MATT: Correct. I haven't got to your turn yet,
though. So, does that end your turn? Do you want

2058
02:22:40,328 --> 02:22:41,241
to move?

2059
02:22:41,241 --> 02:22:42,386
MARISHA: Can I say something?

2060
02:22:42,386 --> 02:22:43,821
MATT: If you want to, yeah

2061
02:22:43,821 --> 02:22:50,916
MARISHA: Everyone, stop, why are we fighting? We
just watched our city burn to the ground. What are

2062
02:22:50,916 --> 02:22:53,086
we fighting over?

2063
02:22:53,086 --> 02:22:55,411
TRAVIS: We're not fighting, they're trying to
protect the skull.

2064
02:22:55,411 --> 02:23:00,827
MARISHA: What does this look like? What does this
look like to you?

2065
02:23:00,827 --> 02:23:02,717
TRAVIS: A statue garden?

2066
02:23:02,717 --> 02:23:09,675
MARISHA: Everyone, get in Percy's workshop and
we're going to talk this out.

2067
02:23:09,675 --> 02:23:14,320
MATT: Pike, it's your turn.

2068
02:23:14,320 --> 02:23:16,800
LAURA: Keyleth, you don't know what's happening.

2069
02:23:16,800 --> 02:23:24,975
MARISHA: I would if any of my fucking party would
for once tell me something. You all didn't tell me

2070
02:23:24,975 --> 02:23:29,691
the full fucking story when we went back into
General Krieg's house, and now look what happened.

2071
02:23:29,691 --> 02:23:33,962
Look what happened because you assholes aren't
communicating.

2072
02:23:33,962 --> 02:23:40,143
TALIESIN: (muffled mumbling)

2073
02:23:40,143 --> 02:23:41,922
MARISHA: Shut up, Percy!

2074
02:23:41,922 --> 02:23:44,988
(laughter)

2075
02:23:44,988 --> 02:23:46,542
MATT: Pike, it's your turn.

2076
02:23:46,542 --> 02:23:55,454
MARISHA: This is because of us, and you all know
it is. Let's figure this out. Go, Pike.

2077
02:23:55,454 --> 02:23:58,933
(laughter)

2078
02:23:58,933 --> 02:24:01,472
ASHLEY: Grog, did you just say you want to protect
the skull?

2079
02:24:01,472 --> 02:24:05,857
TRAVIS: No, I want to break the skull. I want to
get rid of the dragons

2080
02:24:05,857 --> 02:24:11,661
ASHLEY: Okay, what were you trying to do when you
brought Percy and Vex up here?

2081
02:24:11,661 --> 02:24:13,337
LIAM: Vax.

2082
02:24:13,337 --> 02:24:17,828
TRAVIS: It needed someone with a dark touch. But
now it's--

2083
02:24:17,828 --> 02:24:19,244
ASHLEY: To do what?

2084
02:24:19,244 --> 02:24:22,522
TRAVIS: To get the wish, but now it's touching
everyone, they're trying to protect the skull, and

2085
02:24:22,522 --> 02:24:26,124
we don't want that. We want it broken, I think.

2086
02:24:26,124 --> 02:24:27,727
ASHLEY: But you want the wish?

2087
02:24:27,727 --> 02:24:32,873
TRAVIS: Yeah, we want the wish, we can do whatever
we want to with the wish and not take it, but yeah.

2088
02:24:32,873 --> 02:24:36,783
ASHLEY: There has to be some type of payment, if
we take a wish.

2089
02:24:36,783 --> 02:24:40,297
TRAVIS: Well, it didn't say anything about a
payment. There are four dragons killing

2090
02:24:40,297 --> 02:24:41,349
everything.

2091
02:24:41,349 --> 02:24:45,186
MATT: At this point, as you guys are having this
conversation, and you guys are darting out, Vex,

2092
02:24:45,186 --> 02:24:51,034
you stop, as coming down the stairs from the main
floor is Erwen. Frazzled, but still put together

2093
02:24:51,034 --> 02:24:52,097
as well as he can.

2094
02:24:52,097 --> 02:24:53,564
LAURA: I tuck it behind my back.

2095
02:24:53,564 --> 02:24:59,983
MATT: "I'm sorry, Lady Vex'ahlia, it appears you
have a few guests, suddenly."

2096
02:24:59,983 --> 02:25:02,699
LAURA: What? What kind of guests?

2097
02:25:02,699 --> 02:25:09,451
MATT: "She's been here before. I don't recognize
the other; in the dining area."

2098
02:25:09,451 --> 02:25:12,341
LAURA: What does she look like?

2099
02:25:12,341 --> 02:25:18,469
MATT: "Blonde hair."

2100
02:25:18,469 --> 02:25:19,792
TRAVIS: Allura.

2101
02:25:19,792 --> 02:25:21,114
MATT: "Dwarven individual."

2102
02:25:21,114 --> 02:25:23,210
MARISHA: Oh my god, it's Allura and Kima.

2103
02:25:23,210 --> 02:25:24,842
LIAM: This is a little like Clue: the Movie.

2104
02:25:24,842 --> 02:25:35,570
LAURA: It kind of is. Yes-- Erwen. Bring them down
here. It's an emergency

2105
02:25:35,570 --> 02:25:37,877
MATT: "Very well, I'll--"

2106
02:25:37,877 --> 02:25:39,517
LAURA: As quickly as possible.

2107
02:25:39,517 --> 02:25:43,399
MATT: "Yes, yes." And he turns around and hustles up
the stairs.

2108
02:25:43,399 --> 02:25:45,696
MARISHA: Can we all please go back in Percy's
workshop?

2109
02:25:45,696 --> 02:25:47,529
LAURA: Not yet, darling.

2110
02:25:47,529 --> 02:25:48,732
MARISHA: Why not?

2111
02:25:48,732 --> 02:25:53,918
LIAM: Keyleth, let's just wait until Allura gets
here. I feel like she might have a calming effect

2112
02:25:53,918 --> 02:25:56,162
on this situation, an outside eye.

2113
02:25:56,162 --> 02:25:59,963
MARISHA: We are standing in the damn hall, all I
am asking is that we move into a quiet room.

2114
02:25:59,963 --> 02:26:05,015
MATT: At this point now, at the top of the
stairway, two individuals come walking down. First

2115
02:26:05,015 --> 02:26:13,936
and foremost, you see a dwarven male with short
black hair and a beard, trimmed fairly fine, red

2116
02:26:13,936 --> 02:26:23,316
leathers, carrying some sort of crooked wand on
the side. Behind him you see, hair tossed back as

2117
02:26:23,316 --> 02:26:27,099
she rushes down after him, Arcanist Allura
Vysoren.

2118
02:26:27,099 --> 02:26:28,953
LIAM: I sheath my daggers.

2119
02:26:28,953 --> 02:26:35,042
MATT: Okay. She looks about curiously and the
dwarf goes, "Okay, what have we stepped into here?"

2120
02:26:35,042 --> 02:26:42,727
And Allura puts her hand on his shoulder
and goes, "Don't worry. I apologize for my

2121
02:26:42,727 --> 02:26:47,157
"intrusion. I had a-- is everything all right?"

2122
02:26:47,157 --> 02:26:49,453
LAURA: We could use your help at this moment.

2123
02:26:49,453 --> 02:26:58,713
MATT: "Certainly. Sorry, this is a long-time
friend of mine, Elementalist Drake Thunderbrand.

2124
02:26:58,713 --> 02:27:01,199
"If you don't mind him accompanying us as well?"

2125
02:27:01,199 --> 02:27:02,565
LAURA: Is he good?

2126
02:27:02,565 --> 02:27:03,757
MATT: "Oh, he's one of the finest."

2127
02:27:03,757 --> 02:27:05,113
LAURA: A good person?

2128
02:27:05,113 --> 02:27:08,165
MATT: "I've put my life in his hands a number of
times, yes."

2129
02:27:08,165 --> 02:27:14,019
LIAM: Things are a lot more complicated than you
can even imagine. Please come in, we need you.

2130
02:27:14,019 --> 02:27:19,691
MATT: "Yes, yes." And as you guys are having this
standoff, you watch as this black-haired,

2131
02:27:19,691 --> 02:27:24,848
red-leathered dwarf walks in, looking around and
inspecting intently. You don't recognize him,

2132
02:27:24,848 --> 02:27:26,154
you've never seen him before

2133
02:27:26,154 --> 02:27:27,368
TRAVIS: What's he wielding?

2134
02:27:27,368 --> 02:27:33,265
MATT: No weapons on him. You see him clutching
this gnarled, curved wand that almost spirals,

2135
02:27:33,265 --> 02:27:35,970
like a piece of well-treated but messed up wood.

2136
02:27:35,970 --> 02:27:37,130
TRAVIS: A stick.

2137
02:27:37,130 --> 02:27:38,656
LAURA: That's a weapon.

2138
02:27:38,656 --> 02:27:45,404
MATT: Maybe. And Allura rushes in, muttering under
her breath, "I was just in Whitestone and I had a

2139
02:27:45,404 --> 02:27:51,827
"terrible feeling come over me and all my
teleportation sigils within the city were suddenly

2140
02:27:51,827 --> 02:27:59,019
"severed. Both my tower and the Lyceum. I had to
manually teleport us here as it was the only place

2141
02:27:59,019 --> 02:28:04,990
"I really had enough familiarity with far enough
away from the city in case something bad had

2142
02:28:04,990 --> 02:28:07,058
"happened, I hope you don't mind."

2143
02:28:07,058 --> 02:28:10,352
LAURA: Not at all. We're grateful for your help.

2144
02:28:10,352 --> 02:28:14,617
LIAM: Could you do us a favor? We had a small
accident with Percival.

2145
02:28:14,617 --> 02:28:17,338
LAURA: Not yet, not yet.

2146
02:28:17,338 --> 02:28:19,745
TRAVIS: Does she know about the-- D--?

2147
02:28:19,745 --> 02:28:32,426
LIAM: No. So... Emon is in ruins. It's been
destroyed by dragons.

2148
02:28:32,426 --> 02:28:35,452
LAURA: Four. Ancient. Dragons.

2149
02:28:35,452 --> 02:28:38,712
MARISHA: They call themselves the Chroma
Conclave.

2150
02:28:38,712 --> 02:28:44,850
LIAM: And your tower is--

2151
02:28:44,850 --> 02:28:46,872
TRAVIS: Fucked!

2152
02:28:46,872 --> 02:28:48,805
LAURA: We're sorry.

2153
02:28:48,805 --> 02:28:53,003
MARISHA: I'll go ahead and drop the Hold Person on
Percy.

2154
02:28:53,003 --> 02:29:04,054
MATT: And her face goes white, the blood runs from
her entire complexion, and you can see the dwarf

2155
02:29:04,054 --> 02:29:10,061
that initially was huffed up and intense in his
energy, while not fully understanding what's going

2156
02:29:10,061 --> 02:29:16,376
on, looks over to Allura and softens and walks up
and puts his hand on her shoulder. "You okay, lass?"

2157
02:29:16,376 --> 02:29:24,104
LIAM: I'm sorry, my lady. Did you know that Uriel
planned to step down?

2158
02:29:24,104 --> 02:29:28,165
MATT: "He threatened it--"

2159
02:29:28,165 --> 02:29:30,219
LIAM: He did it.

2160
02:29:30,219 --> 02:29:32,538
MATT: "-- for weeks-- what?"

2161
02:29:32,538 --> 02:29:41,840
LIAM: He did it, and moments later four old
dragons descended upon the city.

2162
02:29:41,840 --> 02:29:45,052
MARISHA: The Cloudtop District has been
demolished.

2163
02:29:45,052 --> 02:29:46,537
MATT: "This cannot be."

2164
02:29:46,537 --> 02:29:52,136
MARISHA: We don't know who all is alive or dead.
We can only expect the worst.

2165
02:29:52,136 --> 02:29:53,675
MATT: "This cannot be."

2166
02:29:53,675 --> 02:30:01,241
LAURA: Unfortunately, Allura, all of that is the
reason for our current impasse. We seem to have

2167
02:30:01,241 --> 02:30:11,160
discovered something that could potentially
reverse the situation. But there's a great price

2168
02:30:11,160 --> 02:30:22,456
to pay. It could be a small price to pay, we don't
know. If you wouldn't mind taking a look at this

2169
02:30:22,456 --> 02:30:24,577
relic that we discovered.

2170
02:30:24,577 --> 02:30:28,655
MATT: And you see, she is still lost in thought
and there's something in her mind that's

2171
02:30:28,655 --> 02:30:32,778
distracting her immensely, but she eventually
clarifies and her eyes focus on you once more and

2172
02:30:32,778 --> 02:30:35,824
she goes, "Of course, please."

2173
02:30:35,824 --> 02:30:41,604
LAURA: I don't give it to her, but I pull the
tapestry off of the skull and show it to her.

2174
02:30:41,604 --> 02:30:46,092
MATT: She looks at it and leans forward and begins
muttering something beneath her breath, and she

2175
02:30:46,092 --> 02:30:50,882
goes into technical mode, like she distracts
herself with work at this moment. And as her brow

2176
02:30:50,882 --> 02:30:57,816
furrows, she mutters under her breath and
completes some sort of flash of arcane energy, and

2177
02:30:57,816 --> 02:31:03,252
you can see the flash of energy attaches around
the skull for a second and glints back at her, and

2178
02:31:03,252 --> 02:31:13,236
she goes, "Right, all right, that's-- That skull
is not human, that skull is Githyanki. That is a

2179
02:31:13,236 --> 02:31:26,918
"species that exists primarily on the Astral Plane.
They're rowdy, evil, pirating, marauding

2180
02:31:26,918 --> 02:31:35,713
"individuals, and that's one sense. The gem within
that skull appears to be a soul gem and contains

2181
02:31:35,713 --> 02:31:46,930
"the soul of, from what I can gather, a Githyanki
individual. Very old. I can say at least from my

2182
02:31:46,930 --> 02:31:52,553
"knowledge and learned opinion that no good can
come from such an artifact."

2183
02:31:52,553 --> 02:31:57,233
LAURA: Okay. He can grant a wish, he says? Lying,
truth? What do you think?

2184
02:31:57,233 --> 02:32:04,587
MATT: "It's hard to say. It would take a very
powerful individual to do so, however, I would say

2185
02:32:04,587 --> 02:32:14,622
"that wishes granted by entities that do not
correspond with your moral outlook for the most

2186
02:32:14,622 --> 02:32:20,307
"part rarely end up in your favor, even when
carefully worded."

2187
02:32:20,307 --> 02:32:29,836
LAURA: Right. No, but I remember this, we dealt
with this with the demon that killed Pike.

2188
02:32:29,836 --> 02:32:33,564
MARISHA: Yes, but we used our wish to wish
ourselves out of that contract.

2189
02:32:33,564 --> 02:32:36,524
LAURA: And it had to be so carefully worded.

2190
02:32:36,524 --> 02:32:42,038
MARISHA: We can destroy more, if we're not
careful.

2191
02:32:42,038 --> 02:32:45,255
MATT: "There have been powerful individuals, who
upon obtaining the ability to make such a wish,

2192
02:32:45,255 --> 02:32:53,520
"even as careful as they were, they reached beyond
the means of its magic, and doing so, undid

2193
02:32:53,520 --> 02:32:59,436
"themselves. It's a very, very powerful, very
dangerous magic, and if this entity is indeed

2194
02:32:59,436 --> 02:33:05,207
"even capable of doing so, who's to say the chances
that it wouldn't wreak more havoc than you

2195
02:33:05,207 --> 02:33:06,264
"intended?"

2196
02:33:06,264 --> 02:33:10,402
LIAM: We are in a precarious position. The city is
in ruins, already, in a matter of hours.

2197
02:33:10,402 --> 02:33:11,785
MATT: "Yes, yes."

2198
02:33:11,785 --> 02:33:13,280
MARISHA: What do we do?

2199
02:33:13,280 --> 02:33:16,632
MATT: And at this point, she looks around for a
chair. You can see her hands are shaking, and she goes

2200
02:33:16,632 --> 02:33:20,001
and grabs a chair and pulls it up and sits down
for a second, puts her hands on her knees, and

2201
02:33:20,001 --> 02:33:23,033
quietly, "Describe to me these dragons."

2202
02:33:23,033 --> 02:33:26,402
MARISHA: There was one of each color.

2203
02:33:26,402 --> 02:33:28,378
LAURA: A green, a black, a white.

2204
02:33:28,378 --> 02:33:31,341
TRAVIS: And a big red piece of shit.

2205
02:33:31,341 --> 02:33:36,553
MARISHA: All colors except for blue of the
chromatic spectrum. I got a few of their names.

2206
02:33:36,553 --> 02:33:41,488
MATT: As you go through each color, she nods, but
when you say the big red, her body freezes.

2207
02:33:41,488 --> 02:33:44,874
MARISHA: Does this sound familiar to you?

2208
02:33:44,874 --> 02:33:46,614
MATT: "The names, you said?"

2209
02:33:46,614 --> 02:33:57,077
MARISHA: There's a white dragon that called
himself Vorugal. A green dragon, Raishan. Black

2210
02:33:57,077 --> 02:34:05,361
dragon, Umbrasyl, and the red dragon, we haven't
heard his name yet. He seems to be the leader.

2211
02:34:05,361 --> 02:34:13,204
MATT: At this point she nods and goes, "I know not
the middle two, but Vorugal has been known to

2212
02:34:13,204 --> 02:34:23,005
"wander the wastes north in Othanzia. Some of the
offspring have wandered further, in fact I believe

2213
02:34:23,005 --> 02:34:29,226
"the Skysunder that you destroyed naught but two
years ago that was sealed in the Frostweald was one

2214
02:34:29,226 --> 02:34:38,270
"of its brethren. Its children. But Vorugal has not
been seen wandering this far out. Chromatics do

2215
02:34:38,270 --> 02:34:43,849
"not work together, they are selfish and greedy and
territorial."

2216
02:34:43,849 --> 02:34:48,741
LAURA: They're definitely working together.

2217
02:34:48,741 --> 02:34:50,730
MATT: "This red you say is the leader?"

2218
02:34:50,730 --> 02:34:52,492
LIAM: Yes, most definitely.

2219
02:34:52,492 --> 02:35:06,727
MARISHA: He had a message that he belted over the
entire city. He said that we who live, he's

2220
02:35:06,727 --> 02:35:11,671
showing mercy and that we can either fight or
flee, and then--

2221
02:35:11,671 --> 02:35:15,707
LAURA: He said if we fight or flee, we'll be
denied the mercy.

2222
02:35:15,707 --> 02:35:21,598
MARISHA: Okay, something along those lines. And
then he said that it was the guardians of this

2223
02:35:21,598 --> 02:35:29,001
city that brought this upon Emon, and that he has
control. He called it like a new order.

2224
02:35:29,001 --> 02:35:31,510
LAURA: He said our new purpose is to serve him.

2225
02:35:31,510 --> 02:35:37,010
MATT: Now for the first time, you have known
Allura for quite some time, she's been a very

2226
02:35:37,010 --> 02:35:50,433
stoic, strong, confident, and powerful person. At
this moment, she has withered. She looks genuinely

2227
02:35:50,433 --> 02:35:59,447
like she's hit a level of fear you have never seen
in an individual like this, and it shakes you to

2228
02:35:59,447 --> 02:36:11,046
see this upon her face, and she puts her hand up
and says, "This is not your fault. This burden is mine."

2229
02:36:11,046 --> 02:36:15,248
And looks over to the dwarf and says, "It
is ours." And the dwarf, you can now see, he's

2230
02:36:15,248 --> 02:36:28,931
nodding in understanding. "This dragon... it's
been called many names, but the one that it's

2231
02:36:28,931 --> 02:36:33,589
"taken is Thordak, The Cinder King."

2232
02:36:33,589 --> 02:36:36,613
MARISHA: Thordak?

2233
02:36:36,613 --> 02:36:47,853
MATT: "Thordak. This terrible beast lorded over
half of Marquet for centuries, taking the scalding

2234
02:36:47,853 --> 02:36:57,192
"sands as its domain and its denizens as cattle,
and just as the city of Ank'harel was becoming the

2235
02:36:57,192 --> 02:37:05,790
"jewel of the desert, Thordak struck. A battle,
however, that it was unable to win. Sent away,

2236
02:37:05,790 --> 02:37:13,115
"mortally wounded, it was thought that the dragon
had died soon after, having not been seen for many

2237
02:37:13,115 --> 02:37:23,309
"centuries since. That is, until about 15 years
ago. The rumors of a powerful drake, storming the

2238
02:37:23,309 --> 02:37:30,727
"beaches and seas, had been whispered for a long
time, while ships would be lost at sea. It had

2239
02:37:30,727 --> 02:37:39,782
"survived and secretly ruled the island of Viscan
in the south of the Lucidian Ocean. I suppose

2240
02:37:39,782 --> 02:37:46,568
"after generations, the dragon, now self-crowned as
the Cinder King, grew greedier with the island's

2241

"limited resources and began razing the Mournset
countryside south of the Verdant Expanse and the

2242
02:37:54,644 --> 02:38:03,405
"Stormcrest Mountains." And her eyes get even more
distant as she is recalling all this. "Reports of

2243
02:38:03,405 --> 02:38:08,930
"a dragon more massive than the records can compare
hit Tal'Dorei. At the time, I wasn't part of the

2244
02:38:08,930 --> 02:38:17,574
"council. I traveled with a group of adventurers
much like yourselves: Kima, Drake here, and a

2245
02:38:17,574 --> 02:38:24,700
"handful of other brave souls who are no longer
with us. We traveled to investigate, but arrived

2246
02:38:24,700 --> 02:38:33,369
"to find this creature destroying everything
surrounding the Glade Pools. Port Udall, gone,

2247
02:38:33,369 --> 02:38:42,604
"Byroden a smoldering ruin, and we gathered a small
army of mercenaries and hunted it back to its new

"den in the Stormcrest, where a large number of
lizardfolk had formed around him. But we were

2249
02:38:49,844 --> 02:39:02,345
"overpowered by the sheer might of the dragon. Many
lives were lost. Knowing that we could not kill

2250
02:39:02,345 --> 02:39:10,738
"it, we turned to other means. I called upon the
Arcana Pansophical, a circle of friends, arcane

2251
02:39:10,738 --> 02:39:17,422
"practitioners that agreed to work together across
the land to keep them safe. They devised a trap,

2252
02:39:17,422 --> 02:39:25,455
"one that could, we believed, permanently seal
Thordak within the elemental plane of fire,

2253
02:39:25,455 --> 02:39:33,881
"preventing him from ever returning to our world.
At the sacrifice of many, including our

2254
02:39:33,881 --> 02:39:44,302
"companions Sirus, Dohla, Ghenn, we succeeded." And
as the tears begin to roll down her face, she

2255
02:39:44,302 --> 02:39:56,779
looks around. "For naught now, it seems, and
somehow he has broken our invocation. We bound his

2256
02:39:56,779 --> 02:40:09,016
"essence to the fountains of creation and thought
he would stay there forever." And she goes quiet

2257
02:40:09,016 --> 02:40:12,728
and looks around for a second. "I'm sorry."

2258
02:40:12,728 --> 02:40:16,322
TALIESIN: This couldn't be because of our journey
to the elemental plane, could it?

2259
02:40:16,322 --> 02:40:18,395
MATT: "I'm so sorry."

2260
02:40:18,395 --> 02:40:20,829
TALIESIN: We saw him there.

2261
02:40:20,829 --> 02:40:25,229
MARISHA: We did, but it sounds like he has
been....

2262
02:40:25,229 --> 02:40:32,112
TALIESIN: We didn't set him free, you don't
think?

2263
02:40:32,112 --> 02:40:35,314
TRAVIS: No, it was Keyleth's Ashari thing.

2264
02:40:35,314 --> 02:40:39,286
MARISHA: My people-- Our job is to guard these
realms.

2265
02:40:39,286 --> 02:40:43,786
TALIESIN: Is there any way of contacting the Fire
Ashari?

2266
02:40:43,786 --> 02:40:52,797
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, oh god. Oh god, what if
they're-- what if they're dead?

2267
02:40:52,797 --> 02:40:59,004
MATT: "To bind him, we created an artifact called
a soul anchor. It was crafted from the salvaged

2268
02:40:59,004 --> 02:41:04,897
"heart crystal of a primordial fire titan. The
anchor could not be removed from the plane, and

2269
02:41:04,897 --> 02:41:11,734
"the Cinder King could not leave without it. I
don't know how he's managed to escaped the binding

2270
02:41:11,734 --> 02:41:13,271
"of this."

2271
02:41:13,271 --> 02:41:16,211
MARISHA: Oh my god, this is all my fault.

2272
02:41:16,211 --> 02:41:26,250
TALIESIN: No. No. This was a land mine waiting to
be stepped on.

2273
02:41:26,250 --> 02:41:44,376
MARISHA: But wait. We fought-- We fought my
elders, we fought the Headmaster.

2274
02:41:44,376 --> 02:41:46,086
LAURA: It couldn't have been.

2275
02:41:46,086 --> 02:41:51,139
MATT: "That would have no bearing on this. The
heart crystal is immense. 15, 20 feet in diameter,

2276
02:41:51,139 --> 02:41:58,431
"it's a gem of pure crystallized ruby and elemental
power and energy. Lest you managed to find this

2277
02:41:58,431 --> 02:42:02,819
"and destroy it, which, I mean no offence, is far
beyond your capability."

2278
02:42:02,819 --> 02:42:09,669
MARISHA: My people, would they be okay?

2279
02:42:09,669 --> 02:42:16,039
MATT: "Depends on where he made his way through.
The timing is rather conspicuous, seeing as how

2280
02:42:16,039 --> 02:42:21,509
"Winter's Crest recently passed, in which time the
planes are the thinnest barricades."

2281
02:42:21,509 --> 02:42:23,616
MARISHA: Yeah.

2282
02:42:23,616 --> 02:42:27,549
MATT: "Whatever it is, I fear that our ruse will
not work twice, especially if Thordak has had all

2283
02:42:27,549 --> 02:42:34,482
"this time to obsess over his failure. I do not
know our next course of action."

2284
02:42:34,482 --> 02:42:38,672
MARISHA: What do you know of General Krieg?

2285
02:42:38,672 --> 02:42:41,119
MATT: "He's been gone for some time."

2286
02:42:41,119 --> 02:42:45,545
MARISHA: You were on the council with him, do you
know anything further?

2287
02:42:45,545 --> 02:42:56,165
MATT: "I think it was discussed that he had been
killed during the demonic intrusion in the city,

2288
02:42:56,165 --> 02:42:57,918
"or deserted."

2289
02:42:57,918 --> 02:43:02,124
LAURA: Would a dragon seek vengeance against one
of their brethren killed?

2290
02:43:02,124 --> 02:43:11,620
MATT: "Chromatics are selfish beings, they do not
care for each other, and the power of one is

2291
02:43:11,620 --> 02:43:15,299
"enough, but a conclave of dragons is both
extraordinary and horrifying, but there is no--

2292
02:43:15,299 --> 02:43:24,730
"There is no sense of vengeance for their kin
unless it is against the greater plan. Now, if

2293
02:43:24,730 --> 02:43:29,315
"what you say is true and these other dragons are
bound together in the service of Thordak, I

2294
02:43:29,315 --> 02:43:33,697
"imagine they would be the ones who had the power
and the resources to find some way to bring him through."

2295
02:43:33,697 --> 02:43:36,356
LAURA: All right.

2296
02:43:36,356 --> 02:43:46,698
MATT: At which point, the dwarf steps up and still
has his hand rubbing Allura's shoulder and says,

2297
02:43:46,698 --> 02:43:51,496
"We knew not what we were doing, other than trying
to save it, don't blame yourself."

2298
02:43:51,496 --> 02:43:53,297
MARISHA: Allura.

2299
02:43:53,297 --> 02:43:55,138
MATT: "Yes."

2300
02:43:55,138 --> 02:43:58,918
MARISHA: Would you consider us guardians of this
city?

2301
02:43:58,918 --> 02:44:06,979
MATT: "One of many. I believe the guardians--"

2302
02:44:06,979 --> 02:44:10,333
MARISHA: Is this because of us?

2303
02:44:10,333 --> 02:44:16,849
MATT: Allura looks at you dead-on and says, "The
only guardians that Thordak would know of would be

2304
02:44:16,849 --> 02:44:24,078
"the ones that sent him away to that plane 15 years
ago. This is my fault."

2305
02:44:24,078 --> 02:44:35,948
LIAM: That's not true. If we are to solve this
situation we cannot hide the truth. I killed

2306
02:44:35,948 --> 02:44:42,271
Krieg. We killed Krieg. I finished Krieg.

2307
02:44:42,271 --> 02:44:48,610
LAURA: Krieg was a dragon, Allura.

2308
02:44:48,610 --> 02:44:51,352
MARISHA: A blue dragon.

2309
02:44:51,352 --> 02:45:06,957
LIAM: We stumbled upon his lair, reached through
his home in Emon, through magical means. We found

2310
02:45:06,957 --> 02:45:08,446
his lair.

2311
02:45:08,446 --> 02:45:10,480
LAURA: He attacked us.

2312
02:45:10,480 --> 02:45:16,230
LIAM: And we-- I--

2313
02:45:16,230 --> 02:45:19,554
MARISHA: I reach out and I grab Vax's hand.

2314
02:45:19,554 --> 02:45:21,446
TALIESIN: We survived.

2315
02:45:21,446 --> 02:45:31,570
LIAM: When it happened, he had four stones, four
orbs in his lair. They saw us.

2316
02:45:31,570 --> 02:45:35,904
MARISHA: They spoke out to us.

2317
02:45:35,904 --> 02:45:39,529
TALIESIN: They threatened us.

2318
02:45:39,529 --> 02:45:44,392
MATT: "When was this? Was this--"

2319
02:45:44,498 --> 02:45:46,658
TALIESIN: Many years ago.

2320
02:45:46,658 --> 02:45:48,999
MARISHA: Maybe two years ago.

2321
02:45:48,999 --> 02:45:53,422
LIAM: Not all that long ago.

2322
02:45:53,422 --> 02:45:56,898
LAURA: It was right after we got to Emon.

2323
02:45:56,898 --> 02:46:07,345
MATT: "It's been over a year at least. Well, if it's
taken them that long at least to free Thordak, it

2324
02:46:07,345 --> 02:46:14,702
"means that this was probably in the works for quite
some time. If we do share this responsibility, I

2325
02:46:14,702 --> 02:46:18,916
"assure you it weighs heavier on me than it does
you. But right now we need all the allies we can

2326
02:46:18,916 --> 02:46:23,999
"gather. Now, you say Thordak is where right now?"

2327
02:46:23,999 --> 02:46:27,571
TRAVIS: Sitting on Emon.

2328
02:46:27,571 --> 02:46:28,930
MATT: "Within the city?"

2329
02:46:28,930 --> 02:46:30,130
LAURA: Yeah.

2330
02:46:30,130 --> 02:46:31,769
TALIESIN: Vex, you would know.

2331
02:46:31,769 --> 02:46:35,103
LAURA: Oh, I can sense them. Right.

2332
02:46:35,103 --> 02:46:39,896
MATT: It's for a six-mile radius, was it?

2333
02:46:39,896 --> 02:46:41,115
LAURA: Yeah.

2334
02:46:41,115 --> 02:46:51,022
MATT: On the edge of your senses, you close your
eyes and focus and extend your ability to feel the

2335
02:46:51,022 --> 02:46:58,758
landscape around you. Indeed, The Cinder King
still sits in the center of the city.

2336
02:46:58,758 --> 02:47:01,072
LAURA: He's here.

2337
02:47:01,072 --> 02:47:02,846
MATT: "What of the others?"

2338
02:47:02,846 --> 02:47:04,998
LAURA: Do I sense any others?

2339
02:47:04,998 --> 02:47:06,186
MATT: Nope.

2340
02:47:06,186 --> 02:47:08,966
LAURA: They're gone for the time being.

2341
02:47:08,966 --> 02:47:11,219
TRAVIS: It's weird, they do what he says.

2342
02:47:11,219 --> 02:47:13,410
TALIESIN: Barely.

2343
02:47:13,410 --> 02:47:21,323
LIAM: And on top of all that, we have this fucking
skull.

2344
02:47:21,323 --> 02:47:26,867
MARISHA: I need to check in with my people. I need
to check in with the Air Ashari.

2345
02:47:26,867 --> 02:47:30,847
MATT: "Where's the rest? Where's the council? Who
do we know survived?"

2346
02:47:30,847 --> 02:47:36,317
LAURA: We don't know anything. Everyone was dying
around us, we made it to the keep.

2347
02:47:36,317 --> 02:47:38,351
TRAVIS: It happened very quickly.

2348
02:47:38,351 --> 02:47:41,167
LIAM: We don't know what happened to Uriel, we
didn't see.

2349
02:47:41,167 --> 02:47:46,752
MATT: "We need to take stock of who we can
consider friends that are still around. We need

2350
02:47:46,752 --> 02:47:55,229
"all allies right now. That should be our first
order of business, if anything." And her face

2351
02:47:55,229 --> 02:48:03,420
drops again. "I just lost my connection with
Westruun."

2352
02:48:15,080 --> 02:48:21,952
TRAVIS: Oh fuck. The whole world.

2353
02:48:21,952 --> 02:48:24,077
MARISHA: Yeah, this is an annihilation.

2354
02:48:24,077 --> 02:48:29,551
MATT: "This isn't an annihilation, if this was an
extermination there wouldn't be any survivors, you

2355
02:48:29,551 --> 02:48:33,988
"wouldn't be here. The fact that they've only taken
what they can of the city-- what use is a city

2356
02:48:33,988 --> 02:48:38,107
"to a dragon if it doesn't have worshippers?
They're vain beings."

2357
02:48:38,107 --> 02:48:43,832
MARISHA: Think, Allura, what do all these cities
have in common? And what would be the benefits of

2358
02:48:43,832 --> 02:48:46,267
taking over these cities?

2359
02:48:46,267 --> 02:48:49,050
MATT: "Resources, their gold, their people."

2360
02:48:49,050 --> 02:48:56,113
MARISHA: Do you think they just want domination
over people? Over us? They called us ants!

2361
02:48:56,113 --> 02:48:57,573
MATT: "Yes."

2362
02:48:57,573 --> 02:49:00,088
LAURA: They want to be gods.

2363
02:49:00,088 --> 02:49:04,571
MATT: "What good is a creature that sees itself as
superior if there aren't those around it to tell

2364
02:49:04,571 --> 02:49:09,466
"them as such and confirm the belief, and if anyone
refuses to bend to their will through fear and

2365
02:49:09,466 --> 02:49:12,753
"power. That is the nature of the chromatic
dragons."

2366
02:49:12,753 --> 02:49:16,316
MARISHA: There has to be something more that they
want.

2367
02:49:16,316 --> 02:49:20,463
MATT: "Perhaps, but for now, the fact that he's
even shouted mercy at this time as opposed to

2368
02:49:20,463 --> 02:49:27,568
"completely destroying everything in his wake,
means that vanity can be used to our advantage. I

2369
02:49:27,568 --> 02:49:32,638
"don't know how soon, but that's something. Now--"

2370
02:49:32,638 --> 02:49:38,143
TRAVIS: Allies. Vasselheim has warriors,
armories.

2371
02:49:38,143 --> 02:49:40,157
TALIESIN: Whitestone as well.

2372
02:49:40,157 --> 02:49:42,061
LAURA: We can bring them here.

2373
02:49:42,061 --> 02:49:50,841
MARISHA: I need to reach out to the Ashari and see
if they're-- I leave, I want to go-- Well,

2374
02:49:50,841 --> 02:49:54,419
actually; Allura, will you help me in a scrying
spell?

2375
02:49:54,419 --> 02:49:58,265
MATT: "Yes, yes, the best I can, yes."

2376
02:49:58,265 --> 02:50:02,895
MARISHA: I want to scry and first check in on the
Fire Ashari.

2377
02:50:02,895 --> 02:50:26,117
MATT: Okay. All right, at this point she pulls out
her crystal ball from a little tiny satchel, which

2378
02:50:26,117 --> 02:50:32,452
is in itself a smaller Bag of Holding. Pulls out a
small mirror, takes some water and pours it on the

2379
02:50:32,452 --> 02:50:37,087
mirror, places the sphere above it, and it floats
for a second. And there's a makeshift scrying

2380
02:50:37,087 --> 02:50:42,056
ritual site here before you. You guys take about
ten minutes to concentrate, and if you guys want

2381
02:50:42,056 --> 02:50:45,158
to do anything in that ten-minute period, you're
welcome to, or if you just want to watch and wait,

2382
02:50:45,158 --> 02:50:46,845
you can.

2383
02:50:46,845 --> 02:50:50,549
TALIESIN: I'm going to just sit, it's been a long,
long day.

2384
02:50:50,549 --> 02:50:53,538
MATT: Okay. The spell completes.

2385
02:50:53,538 --> 02:50:55,456
TRAVIS: Can I roll hit dice?

2386
02:50:55,456 --> 02:50:59,372
MATT: Yeah, you guys can begin to take a short
rest, if you want to heal up.

2387
02:50:59,372 --> 02:51:13,824
LIAM: I go over to my sister in that time. I
want-- I want to kill that dragon. Or I want to

2388
02:51:13,824 --> 02:51:15,707
die trying.

2389
02:51:15,707 --> 02:51:19,196
LAURA: We will.

2390
02:51:19,196 --> 02:51:22,378
MARISHA: Do I see Cerkonos?

2391
02:51:22,378 --> 02:51:30,482
MATT: So you take Allura's hand and you put your
focus into the crystal sphere, your vision lifts

2392
02:51:30,482 --> 02:51:41,638
out of the keep with extreme speed. You find your
visual surroundings thrust across the Ozmit Sea.

2393
02:51:41,638 --> 02:51:49,538
You find yourself swooping across the shores of
Othanzia, over the forests, eventually coming upon

2394
02:51:49,538 --> 02:51:57,100
the blackened clouds that perpetually hang above
the charred mountain range that contains the home

2395
02:51:57,100 --> 02:52:04,943
of the Fire Ashari and the entrance to the
elemental plane of fire. Your vision crests the

2396
02:52:04,943 --> 02:52:14,122
mountain and steps into the valley of broken,
blackened shale to the ever-burning forest. As you

2397
02:52:14,122 --> 02:52:21,619
come upon it, you recall where the Fire Ashari
village was and where you were greeted before and

2398
02:52:21,619 --> 02:52:32,529
given your trials. Where there is now nothing but
sundered, broken wood, tents, destroyed bodies

2399
02:52:32,529 --> 02:52:40,728
burned and charred and curled up in horrible
ever-gasping pain. The forest itself is flattened

2400
02:52:40,728 --> 02:52:47,941
from the inside out, like a blast from the center
of it just exploded outward, the trees all bent

2401
02:52:47,941 --> 02:52:55,124
and snapped at the base, and in the center, where
there once was that small pool of molten lava that

2402
02:52:55,124 --> 02:53:00,993
you created the portal through and stepped into
the elemental plane, there is a large, ominous,

2403
02:53:00,993 --> 02:53:10,352
flickering gash between the planes that is roughly
30 to 40 feet in width and height that is pulsing

2404
02:53:10,352 --> 02:53:18,264
as fire and magma pours out of it. You can see
wandering imps and elementals and various entities

2405
02:53:18,264 --> 02:53:25,708
slowly peeking out and escaping and wandering
throughout the mountain tops. From what you can

2406
02:53:25,708 --> 02:53:29,480
see, there are no signs of any survivors.

2407
02:53:29,480 --> 02:53:40,447
MARISHA: It destroyed everything. They killed
everyone.

2408
02:53:40,447 --> 02:53:45,331
MATT: Allura at this point, who pulls out of the
ritual, reaches out and grabs you by the

2409
02:53:45,331 --> 02:53:46,599
shoulders.

2410
02:53:46,599 --> 02:53:47,941
MARISHA: We failed.

2411
02:53:47,941 --> 02:53:55,230
MATT: And she looks you in the eyes, and for a
moment you feel like her normally warm and

2412
02:53:55,230 --> 02:54:02,570
embracing face has gone cold and intense and her
voice seems to echo with an undercurrent of arcane

2413
02:54:02,570 --> 02:54:06,710
focus and volume. She goes--

2414
02:54:06,710 --> 02:54:08,661
MARISHA: My people failed, we failed our cause.

2415
02:54:08,661 --> 02:54:16,353
MATT: "Keyleth, you failed no one, this is not
your doing. This burden is ours as a people to

2416
02:54:16,353 --> 02:54:25,660
"hold, do not let this wash over you or he wins.
This is their making, this is not yours. These

2417
02:54:25,660 --> 02:54:39,261
"creatures are evil incarnate, and it is our job,
our true calling to end what they have done. Do

2418
02:54:39,261 --> 02:54:46,360
"not let this crush you, you are stronger than
that. Pull yourself together. Your people, those

2419
02:54:46,360 --> 02:54:49,221
"that remain, they stand behind you."

2420
02:54:49,221 --> 02:54:51,271
MARISHA: I'm not as strong as you, Allura.

2421
02:54:51,271 --> 02:54:58,962
MATT: "But you can be and you will be. Do you
trust me? Do you trust me?"

2422
02:54:58,962 --> 02:55:00,544
MARISHA: Yes.

2423
02:55:00,544 --> 02:55:04,656
MATT: "Good." Her grasp releases.

2424
02:55:04,656 --> 02:55:10,268
MARISHA: That's my people.

2425
02:55:10,268 --> 02:55:24,392
MATT: "And mine, and all of ours. There are many
secrets in these lands. I'm a firm believer that

2426
02:55:24,392 --> 02:55:35,745
"there's always a way to victory, if we are smart
about it and if we're quick about it. Now, I think

2427
02:55:35,745 --> 02:55:43,697
"we should look for survivors. Gather those we know
that can rally to our cause, in Emon and beyond.

2428
02:55:43,697 --> 02:55:50,369
"What say you?"

2429
02:55:50,369 --> 02:55:52,140
TALIESIN: Aye.

2430
02:55:52,140 --> 02:55:53,168
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2431
02:55:53,168 --> 02:55:54,580
MARISHA: Aye.

2432
02:55:54,580 --> 02:55:59,107
LIAM: We are to stand now or we might as well be
dead.

2433
02:55:59,107 --> 02:56:02,401
LAURA: So we're definitely not going to wish on
this skull then, yeah?

2434
02:56:02,401 --> 02:56:04,385
MATT: "I would recommend against it."

2435
02:56:04,385 --> 02:56:10,000
MARISHA: Yeah, I stand.

2436
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:20,231
MATT: "Very well, let us prepare for the fall of
the Chroma Conclave. Together."

2437
02:56:20,231 --> 02:56:22,671
And that's where we'll end our session for tonight.

2438
02:56:22,671 --> 02:56:28,791
LAURA: Fucking A!

2439
02:56:28,791 --> 02:56:31,428
MATT: Hey guys, D&amp;D's fun!

2440
02:56:31,428 --> 02:56:33,124
(laughter)

2441
02:56:33,124 --> 02:56:36,314
MARISHA: D&amp;D will never be fun again; everything's
ruined.

2442
02:56:36,314 --> 02:56:38,339
LIAM: Hey, we're all cows!

2443
02:56:38,339 --> 02:56:40,806
(laughter)

2444
02:56:40,806 --> 02:56:44,342
MARISHA: Back when things were so much simpler.

2445
02:56:44,342 --> 02:56:48,785
LIAM: Be sure to buy a t-shirt over on
geekandsundry.com.

2446
02:56:48,785 --> 02:56:50,390
TRAVIS: Wow.

2447
02:56:50,390 --> 02:56:51,744
LIAM: In Sam's honor.

2448
02:56:51,744 --> 02:56:53,825
LAURA: What in the hell.

2449
02:56:53,825 --> 02:56:59,061
TALIESIN: Brought to you by Wyrmwood Gaming.
Specifically designed to absorb tears.

2450
02:56:59,061 --> 02:57:01,256
(laughter)

2451
02:57:01,256 --> 02:57:04,386
MARISHA: Ah yes, thank you. It's so porous.

2452
02:57:04,386 --> 02:57:06,022
MATT: So yeah.

2453
02:57:06,022 --> 02:57:10,027
ASHLEY: Can we play longer?

2454
02:57:10,027 --> 02:57:12,904
TRAVIS: Can we play longer?

2455
02:57:12,904 --> 02:57:14,103
MATT: Aww.

2456
02:57:14,103 --> 02:57:16,727
MARISHA: What time is it? It's ten o'clock, and we
ended on time and--

2457
02:57:16,727 --> 02:57:19,028
LAURA: That's the first time we've ever ended on
time.

2458
02:57:19,028 --> 02:57:23,431
LIAM: Wow, that game felt like 20 hours.

2459
02:57:23,431 --> 02:57:27,206
TRAVIS: Yeah. Originally this was supposed to be a
three-hour show, but it never quite made it that way.

2460
02:57:27,206 --> 02:57:34,144
MATT: I know we tried, we try and mostly fail, but
occasionally we get it right. So, I mean, I'd say

2461
02:57:34,144 --> 02:57:37,025
I'm sorry for the emotional rollercoaster, but
no.

2462
02:57:37,025 --> 02:57:41,644
TRAVIS: The was fucking awesome.That was awesome,
aside from the death.

2463
02:57:41,644 --> 02:57:48,893
TALIESIN: I would have kicked your ass, by the
way, just throwing that out there. I picked up the

2464
02:57:48,893 --> 02:57:51,015
poker because I didn't want to hurt you.

2465
02:57:51,015 --> 02:57:53,185
(laughter)

2466
02:57:53,185 --> 02:57:55,933
TRAVIS: All right, okay.

2467
02:57:55,933 --> 02:57:57,886
TALIESIN: Throwing that out there.

2468
02:57:57,886 --> 02:58:04,506
LIAM: My plan was to take that skull and run like
a fucking football player and fucking go for the goal.

2469
02:58:04,506 --> 02:58:06,037
TALIESIN: Flash Gordon.

2470
02:58:06,037 --> 02:58:10,938
LIAM: Yeah. I would have been in the heart of
Emon. Shoving it up the red dragon's nose.

2471
02:58:10,938 --> 02:58:13,621
MATT: Well. Welcome to the new story arc.

2472
02:58:13,621 --> 02:58:14,815
LAURA: Oh jeez.

2473
02:58:14,815 --> 02:58:16,947
(cheering)

2474
02:58:16,947 --> 02:58:18,315
LAURA: Everything changed.

2475
02:58:18,315 --> 02:58:20,556
MATT: Yeah. Oh man.

2476
02:58:20,556 --> 02:58:22,158
LAURA: Everything.

2477
02:58:22,158 --> 02:58:24,325
TALIESIN: When do I level up?

2478
02:58:24,325 --> 02:58:28,895
MARISHA: I'm going to find a corner to rock back
and forth in.

2479
02:58:28,895 --> 02:58:32,049
LIAM: We would have been working in a lich's sugar
mine if you'd done that.

2480
02:58:32,049 --> 02:58:36,586
TRAVIS: Nah, we all would have been kings
and queens, we would be drinking iced mochas.

2481
02:58:36,586 --> 02:58:41,306
MARISHA: I was more afraid of us wishing ourselves
out of existence. I wish there were no more

2482
02:58:41,306 --> 02:58:43,316
dragons... and no more people and no more--

2483
02:58:43,316 --> 02:58:47,739
TALIESIN: It was such a bad deal, <i>I</i> said no.
Like, can you imagine how bad of a deal that must

2484
02:58:47,739 --> 02:58:48,917
have been?

2485
02:58:48,917 --> 02:58:50,541
LIAM: That's a good point.

2486
02:58:50,541 --> 02:58:53,264
TALIESIN: I was really looking for a reason to say
yes.

2487
02:58:53,264 --> 02:58:59,541
MARISHA: And it turns out that it was just a
fucking lame-ass pirate. Fuck that, we don't want

2488
02:58:59,541 --> 02:59:01,716
to be indebted to some shithead pirate.

2489
02:59:01,716 --> 02:59:06,965
TALIESIN: Nothing good happens when you let
Mxyzptlk out of the goddamn skull.

2490
02:59:06,965 --> 02:59:11,264
MATT: It was fun. I set a time for myself when
she's gonna arrive, and I was like, "Oh man,

2491
02:59:11,264 --> 02:59:17,144
"what's going to happen before she gets there?" I
was like, as you guys kept delaying it, they might

2492
02:59:17,144 --> 02:59:19,437
actually-- she might actually catch them in time.

2493
02:59:19,437 --> 02:59:22,004
MARISHA: She would have walked in and we're
beating the shit out of each other.

2494
02:59:22,004 --> 02:59:23,840
LAURA: It all would have gone to hell if--

2495
02:59:23,840 --> 02:59:26,880
MATT: You don't know what would happen. You don't
know.

2496
02:59:26,880 --> 02:59:29,968
TRAVIS: I would have saved the world, that's what
would have happened. Fucking one.

2497
02:59:29,968 --> 02:59:33,633
MATT: None of you have heard of a githyanki in
your travels.

2498
02:59:33,633 --> 02:59:36,374
TRAVIS: I would have been King Grog, I would have
gotten a cave, I would had a bunch of harem people

2499
02:59:36,374 --> 02:59:39,605
taking care of me, giving me sponge baths with
their tongues.

2500
02:59:39,605 --> 02:59:42,019
LIAM: I was going to carve my name in your nuts.

2501
02:59:42,019 --> 02:59:44,275
TRAVIS: I would object to that.

2502
02:59:44,275 --> 02:59:49,406
TALIESIN: I was going to gender swap, I wanted--
Percy was going to become Percina.

2503
02:59:49,406 --> 02:59:51,336
(laughter)

2504
02:59:51,336 --> 02:59:53,110
MARISHA: I wish I was a woman.

2505
02:59:53,110 --> 02:59:57,644
MARISHA: We still have the dragon problem, but now
have the dragon and a pirate.

2506
02:59:57,644 --> 03:00:03,063
MATT: There you go-- the de Rolo sisters-- Glad
you could make it, Ashley.

2507
03:00:03,063 --> 03:00:06,971
(cheering)

2508
03:00:06,971 --> 03:00:08,987
MATT: You should make it every week.

2509
03:00:08,987 --> 03:00:12,323
MARISHA: Does this mean I'm the last druid to make
the Aramente?

2510
03:00:12,323 --> 03:00:14,330
MATT: You don't know.

2511
03:00:14,330 --> 03:00:15,625
TALIESIN: There might have been one after you.

2512
03:00:15,625 --> 03:00:17,226
LAURA: There's got to be other ones.

2513
03:00:17,226 --> 03:00:23,424
MATT: From what you saw, the Fire Ashari were
decimated, you saw a number of bodies, you don't

2514
03:00:23,424 --> 03:00:29,076
know if any escaped, you don't if any were hidden,
you don't know what happened. At that location, it

2515
03:00:29,076 --> 03:00:36,121
is desolation, and you get the sense from that,
that is precisely the place where Thordak came

2516
03:00:36,121 --> 03:00:37,690
through the plane.

2517
03:00:37,690 --> 03:00:40,070
MARISHA: I'm wondering about the other locations,
though, too.

2518
03:00:40,070 --> 03:00:42,204
TALIESIN: I want to know about Whitestone. We have
a lot a phone calls to make.

2519
03:00:42,204 --> 03:00:43,990
MARISHA: We have a lot of phone calls. Like I--

2520
03:00:43,990 --> 03:00:45,736
TRAVIS: They're all dead, everybody's dead.

2521
03:00:45,736 --> 03:00:47,621
MARISHA: Theoretically wiped my people off the
face of the planet.

2522
03:00:47,621 --> 03:00:51,047
MATT: Such an optimist.

2523
03:00:51,047 --> 03:00:53,126
MARISHA: If they all busted through--

2524
03:00:53,126 --> 03:00:57,677
TALIESIN: Does decimate mean that 1/10 survived?
Or that only 10% died? I can never remember which

2525
03:00:57,677 --> 03:00:59,786
one decimated is. I know it's one of the two.

2526
03:00:59,786 --> 03:01:03,606
MATT: Yeah, that term has been largely misused in
the current-day vernacular.

2527
03:01:03,606 --> 03:01:04,833
TALIESIN: I know.

2528
03:01:04,833 --> 03:01:07,747
10% died, that's what it is.

2529
03:01:07,747 --> 03:01:09,567
TRAVIS: I love misusing vernacular.

2530
03:01:09,567 --> 03:01:11,470
MATT: It's fun. You guys--

2531
03:01:11,470 --> 03:01:17,094
TRAVIS: Great fucking story Matt, holy shit. Holy
shit, you had trees and stuff.

2532
03:01:17,094 --> 03:01:18,790
TALIESIN: Why do you got to be a dick, man?

2533
03:01:18,790 --> 03:01:23,851
MATT: As we're discovering the white battlemats
don't pick up as well on the camera as the colors,

2534
03:01:23,851 --> 03:01:26,944
I'm trying to use other options whenever
possible.

2535
03:01:26,944 --> 03:01:28,869
TRAVIS: It works. The green was amazing.

2536
03:01:28,869 --> 03:01:30,324
LAURA: It was really cool with green.

2537
03:01:30,324 --> 03:01:33,269
MATT: So I'm going to try and push more on that. A
little more work on my end, but it'll be fine.

2538
03:01:33,269 --> 03:01:35,270
LIAM: Tell me more, sadist.

2539
03:01:35,270 --> 03:01:37,723
LAURA: Thanks for joining us, you guys.

2540
03:01:37,723 --> 03:01:41,281
MATT: You guys, thank you for watching, and hope
you have a wonderful night, and we'll see you guys

2541
03:01:41,281 --> 03:01:44,312
next Thursday. Good night!

2542
03:01:44,312 --> 03:01:46,408
MARISHA: I need a cigarette, and I don't smoke.
