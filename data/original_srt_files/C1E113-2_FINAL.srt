1
00:00:00,297 --> 00:00:05,885
MATT: And welcome back to our second half of our
Shadow of War game, brought to you and sponsored

2
00:00:05,885 --> 00:00:13,316
by WB Games. Thank you so much for letting this
happen. All of us are all voice actors in the

3
00:00:13,316 --> 00:00:18,327
game, in case you didn't check out the intro to
the first half. We're excited to bring these

4
00:00:18,327 --> 00:00:22,653
orcish characters of this one-shot together. If
you haven't seen the first half, you should

5
00:00:22,653 --> 00:00:26,497
probably go back and watch that first. Otherwise,
you'll be really confused.

6
00:00:26,497 --> 00:00:28,398
LAURA: You should because it's really good.

7
00:00:28,398 --> 00:00:29,706
DARIN: Well, we could do it right now.

8
00:00:29,706 --> 00:00:30,902
LAURA: Yeah, do it all again?

9
00:00:30,902 --> 00:00:36,499
MATT: Yeah! Fine! But yeah, Shadow of War comes
out October 10th, looking forward to that. The

10
00:00:36,499 --> 00:00:45,187
Shadow of War iOS and Android game is out now, so
check it out. Anyway, bringing us back in. As the Forcs--

11
00:00:45,187 --> 00:00:47,616
TRAVIS and LAURA: The Forcs!

12
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:52,321
MATT: As the Forcs have taken their break to rest
themselves for a moment, to assess what to do

13
00:00:52,321 --> 00:00:58,388
next, you are now standing on the opposite edge of
one of the Mithrim Spur Mountains, just past the

14
00:00:58,388 --> 00:01:04,261
crest. As you traveled down, you found hidden in
this alcove, six uruks, five of which are

15
00:01:04,261 --> 00:01:07,348
currently sleeping and bundled, and one who's
keeping watch with a burning torch.

16
00:01:07,348 --> 00:01:09,160
LAURA: Wait, did we actually take a short rest?

17
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,420
SAM: No.

18
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,053
TRAVIS: I got the numbers wrong.

19
00:01:12,053 --> 00:01:14,121
LAURA: I thought it was intentional.

20
00:01:14,121 --> 00:01:15,422
TRAVIS: Totally.

21
00:01:15,422 --> 00:01:18,714
LAURA: We took a moment, so I didn't actually get
my action surge back.

22
00:01:18,714 --> 00:01:19,781
MATT: Nope.

23
00:01:19,781 --> 00:01:21,609
SAM: Why are you Australian now?

24
00:01:21,609 --> 00:01:22,918
LAURA: Am I?

25
00:01:22,918 --> 00:01:24,499
TRAVIS: It's super flexible.

26
00:01:24,499 --> 00:01:26,797
LAURA: Don't you worry about it, Samuel.

27
00:01:26,797 --> 00:01:33,070
DARIN: If you've seen the first part, please send
us a clip of what we sounded like at that point.

28
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:42,500
So we can go back, "Oh, right!" Because apparently
(French accent) I am this orc. I enjoy a fork.

29
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:51,650
TRAVIS: Slavic. Listen, I have not bathed a short
sword in blood under the cover of dark in so long!

30
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:58,435
I want to sneak up, and I want to take their
bowels and pull them out while they sleep. But! We

31
00:01:58,435 --> 00:02:02,272
have to take care of that one that's watching
guard, first. Who's sneaky?

32
00:02:02,272 --> 00:02:04,038
LAURA: Should I run down there and kill him?

33
00:02:04,038 --> 00:02:05,419
TRAVIS: Naw, are you sneaky?

34
00:02:05,419 --> 00:02:06,664
LAURA: I don't know.

35
00:02:06,664 --> 00:02:08,466
TRAVIS: Can you look?

36
00:02:08,466 --> 00:02:11,278
SAM: Skak, don't you have some sort of a
crossbow?

37
00:02:11,278 --> 00:02:12,379
TRAVIS: I do!

38
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:14,249
SAM: Maybe you should be the one to take him
down.

39
00:02:14,249 --> 00:02:16,856
LAURA: Maybe we can lead him toward us and then--

40
00:02:16,856 --> 00:02:18,532
SAM: Oh, we could cause a diversion!

41
00:02:18,532 --> 00:02:21,683
LAURA: Yeah, and then you can take him out away
from the guards that're sleeping.

42
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:22,941
TRAVIS: I like it!

43
00:02:22,941 --> 00:02:28,040
SAM: Wait. If we make a noise or something, won't
he wake up everybody else?

44
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,631
LAURA: What if we hit him with a rock and he comes
looking for it?

45
00:02:30,631 --> 00:02:32,908
TRAVIS: Yeah, or you crack a branch, right?
(cracking noise)

46
00:02:32,908 --> 00:02:37,499
LAURA: Oh, that's a good idea! And I take a really
big branch and I break it in half.

47
00:02:37,499 --> 00:02:42,189
SAM: Oh no. We're dumb.

48
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:50,410
MATT: The minute you hear the (cracking) sound,
you hear this faint (grunt) sound over the cliff.

49
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:53,221
As you glance over, you see the one with the torch
is now like--

50
00:02:53,221 --> 00:02:55,266
SAM: How far away is he?

51
00:02:55,266 --> 00:02:58,219
MATT: About 25 feet from you, 30 feet, down
below.

52
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:00,350
SAM: Crossbow him!

53
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,369
LAURA: (hooting)

54
00:03:02,369 --> 00:03:04,839
MATT: He's now walking toward one of them to
start--

55
00:03:04,839 --> 00:03:07,362
LAURA: I'm trying to sound like an owl in the
night. Hoo-hoo!

56
00:03:07,362 --> 00:03:10,261
MATT: Make a performance check.

57
00:03:10,261 --> 00:03:11,452
LAURA: Okay.

58
00:03:11,452 --> 00:03:14,939
TRAVIS: Can I aid her? Can I aid her with my Minor
Illusion?

59
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:20,621
MATT: Sure. How-- what are you going to do?

60
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:23,383
TRAVIS: Let's make it, like, a two-headed owl.

61
00:03:23,383 --> 00:03:26,922
LAURA: I like it. Do I roll at advantage, then?

62
00:03:26,922 --> 00:03:36,191
MATT: Because it's a two-headed owl? No. Sorry.
What'd you roll?

63
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:39,092
LAURA: Oh, I rolled a three. Minus two.

64
00:03:39,092 --> 00:03:47,295
MATT: (laughing) So it's a (gurgling).

65
00:03:47,295 --> 00:03:51,503
LAURA and TRAVIS: (hooting and gurgling)

66
00:03:51,503 --> 00:03:52,677
TRAVIS: Wait, harmony.

67
00:03:52,677 --> 00:03:54,642
LAURA and TRAVIS: (harmonizing) Hoo!

68
00:03:54,642 --> 00:03:57,698
SAM: Little pitchy.

69
00:03:57,698 --> 00:04:02,473
MATT: The uruk keeping guard immediately goes,
"What the shrak?" Goes and starts shaking one of

70
00:04:02,473 --> 00:04:03,542
them awake.

71
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:05,038
LAURA: Oh no! Hit him before he does that!

72
00:04:05,038 --> 00:04:08,069
TRAVIS: I take the crossbow and I try to put it
right in the back, where his head meets his neck.

73
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:11,607
MATT: Okay. He doesn't currently see you,
necessarily. Roll a stealth check.

74
00:04:11,607 --> 00:04:14,904
TRAVIS: 20.

75
00:04:14,904 --> 00:04:19,620
MATT: Does not seem to see you, so roll advantage
on the attack.

76
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,259
TRAVIS: Okay. Natural 20.

77
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:28,976
MATT: So go ahead and roll the dice.

78
00:04:28,976 --> 00:04:33,802
TRAVIS: Okay. d8 plus four. Eight, (counting).

79
00:04:33,802 --> 00:04:36,909
MATT: Well, roll your sneak attack damage too,
because that all gets doubled as well.

80
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:42,829
TRAVIS: 16, 19, 22.

81
00:04:42,829 --> 00:04:44,480
LAURA: 22 times two.

82
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:49,460
MATT: Well, you don't add the modifier to it yet.
Double dice. So 22 times two? As he's shaking one

83
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:58,841
of the uruk, he's like, "Hey, get up! Oof!"
(gurgling) The one uruk's like, "What the shit?

84
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:08,150
"I was sleeping!" The other one's like, (gurgling)
and falls onto his back, dead. He's like, "Huh?"

85
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:12,709
The other one's getting up. He's leaning forward
now, inspecting the one who was there keeping watch.

86
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:15,189
TRAVIS: I can cast Sleep.

87
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,620
LAURA: Do it!

88
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,861
DARIN: I can use Misty Step. Can I? To sneak
over.

89
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,820
MATT: You could appear right behind him if you
wanted to.

90
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,932
DARIN: I would like to use Misty Step.

91
00:05:23,932 --> 00:05:29,411
MATT: All right, so, as you're doing this, you
slip into the shadows and quickly dart through the

92
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:34,610
shadow, appearing behind the one who's waking up.
He's like, "What in the--?" What are you going to do?

93
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:38,976
DARIN: I speak for Sauron. And I try to rip his
throat out.

94
00:05:38,976 --> 00:05:40,678
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

95
00:05:40,678 --> 00:05:43,711
LAURA: Rip it out quietly!

96
00:05:43,711 --> 00:05:45,290
TRAVIS: Shh!

97
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:48,350
MATT: Make a grapple check. So go ahead and roll
athletics.

98
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:54,157
DAVIS: 16, plus my strength? 19.

99
00:05:54,157 --> 00:06:00,093
MATT: All right, so, as it's sitting up from its
weird, tattered bedroll, you whisper in its ear,

100
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:04,631
"I speak for Sauron." Grab the back of its head.
Go ahead and roll an attack to try and bite into

101
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:06,092
its throat.

102
00:06:06,092 --> 00:06:09,387
DARIN: That is 13.

103
00:06:09,387 --> 00:06:13,173
MATT: 13? Roll damage.

104
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:16,742
DARIN: Seven.

105
00:06:16,742 --> 00:06:24,291
MATT: Okay. Seven points. All right. As you pull
the head back and bite into the throat, it's like

106
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:28,833
(gurgling and gasping). You tear a chunk out of
its throat, but it's making all these gurgling

107
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:32,037
noises. All the other uruks start rousing.

108
00:06:32,037 --> 00:06:34,763
LAURA: You should snap its neck! It's quieter!

109
00:06:34,763 --> 00:06:36,354
MATT: So what do you want to do?

110
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,965
DARIN: I have another attack. I'm going to bite
his neck again.

111
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:40,855
MATT: Go for it.

112
00:06:40,855 --> 00:06:43,292
LAURA: He's a creative one, Mozuu.

113
00:06:43,292 --> 00:06:49,936
DARIN: You see, Mozuu the Chosen means, I choose
one thing and I do it over and over again, and

114
00:06:49,936 --> 00:06:53,784
that's it. That's it! That's what Sauron said. It
is a 13.

115
00:06:53,784 --> 00:06:55,901
MATT: 13, all right. Go ahead and roll damage.
Second time.

116
00:06:55,901 --> 00:07:00,994
DARIN: For the love of Pete's Dragon. Okay, that
is another seven because that's what happens.

117
00:07:00,994 --> 00:07:03,105
TRAVIS: I thought he said quietly!

118
00:07:03,105 --> 00:07:06,809
MATT: All right, as you go, (growling) Still
alive. Bite down again and pull out another

119
00:07:06,809 --> 00:07:12,037
piece. You're taking chunks out of this orc's
throat but it's still alive. It's like (yelling),

120
00:07:12,037 --> 00:07:16,538
reaching up and grabbing at you now, and it's got
the back of your head and is trying to pull you

121
00:07:16,538 --> 00:07:19,709
onto the ground. All the other ones are rousing
and grabbing their weapons.

122
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:21,621
LAURA: I think they know we're here.

123
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:24,156
SAM: Are they up? Are they behind a wall?

124
00:07:24,156 --> 00:07:28,495
MATT: They're in an alcove, like a little
cliffside platform at the side of the mountain.

125
00:07:28,495 --> 00:07:33,333
There's a mountain wall and then an outcropping,
and they're on the outcropping. It's hidden,

126
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,295
recessed. Below you.

127
00:07:35,295 --> 00:07:40,266
SAM: Below us! Oh, we're coming in from the
mountain. So we can jump down.

128
00:07:40,266 --> 00:07:42,066
MATT: If you want to try.

129
00:07:42,066 --> 00:07:44,668
LAURA: We didn't take a short rest, though.

130
00:07:44,668 --> 00:07:46,117
MATT: It's about 25 feet down below.

131
00:07:46,117 --> 00:07:47,637
LAURA: That would've been real smart.

132
00:07:47,637 --> 00:07:49,292
DARIN: To be fair, they know <i>I'm</i> here.

133
00:07:49,292 --> 00:07:51,896
LAURA: Maybe I should rest while this is going on
because I should really rest.

134
00:07:51,896 --> 00:07:53,662
TRAVIS: I'll cast Sleep on them.

135
00:07:53,662 --> 00:07:55,907
MATT: So you pull out a small pouch--

136
00:07:55,907 --> 00:08:02,186
TRAVIS: Yeah, with like, sleeping powder and
herbs. I untie the top of it and I go, (whoosh).

137
00:08:02,186 --> 00:08:07,795
MATT: All righty. So--

138
00:08:07,795 --> 00:08:09,208
LAURA: You're going to sleep too!

139
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:11,108
TRAVIS: Oh shit, well, I'm sure--

140
00:08:11,108 --> 00:08:13,619
MATT: All right, roll 5d8.

141
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:15,844
LAURA: Wow, 5d8?!

142
00:08:15,844 --> 00:08:19,560
DARIN: Orc throat makes me sleepy.

143
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,479
LAURA: It's 5d8 of--? Oh, okay, I know.

144
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,807
TRAVIS: 32.

145
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:36,090
MATT: 32. So two of the uruk that are getting up
out of bed are like, (grunt) reach for their

146
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:42,007
weapons, and are like (grunting, then snoring),
and fall immediately back to sleep. The other

147
00:08:42,007 --> 00:08:44,468
three, however, are still rousing up from their
slumber.

148
00:08:44,468 --> 00:08:45,717
TRAVIS: The other three are?

149
00:08:45,717 --> 00:08:46,737
MATT: Yeah.

150
00:08:46,737 --> 00:08:48,298
TRAVIS: That's the best I got.

151
00:08:48,298 --> 00:08:50,880
MATT: At this point, combat is definitely engaged.
I need you all to roll initiative.

152
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,219
DARIN: And I'm okay? I did not fall asleep?

153
00:08:54,219 --> 00:08:58,488
MATT: Well, no, because it affects creatures with
the lower hit dice, and you actually have a higher

154
00:08:58,488 --> 00:09:00,685
hit point value than most of them there. So you
weren't affected.

155
00:09:00,685 --> 00:09:03,830
TRAVIS: And I choose? I choose which one--

156
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:04,979
LAURA: No.

157
00:09:04,979 --> 00:09:06,124
DARIN: 14.

158
00:09:06,124 --> 00:09:08,088
TRAVIS: It says I choose--

159
00:09:08,088 --> 00:09:09,708
SAM: Well, it doesn't matter.

160
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:10,798
MATT: All right.

161
00:09:10,798 --> 00:09:12,376
SAM: Seven.

162
00:09:12,376 --> 00:09:14,011
MATT: Seven, all righty.

163
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,478
LAURA: Eight.

164
00:09:15,478 --> 00:09:16,874
MATT: All righty.

165
00:09:16,874 --> 00:09:26,053
TRAVIS: 21. I need to be a little intelligent
bastard from now on.

166
00:09:26,053 --> 00:09:35,380
MATT: All righty. So Skak, you're up first. You
just threw the sleep powder into the air. You

167
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:38,946
watch as they get to their feet and begin to pull
their weapons out. It looks like the fray is on.

168
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:41,157
You're at the top of the combat round. What do you
want to do?

169
00:09:41,157 --> 00:09:43,133
TRAVIS: I'll take the nearest one with my crossbow
and fire.

170
00:09:43,133 --> 00:09:44,376
MATT: Okay, go for it.

171
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:48,628
TRAVIS: Is he within melee range of him, for sneak
attack? Probably not, because he's working on the

172
00:09:48,628 --> 00:09:50,069
guy with the throat, right?

173
00:09:50,069 --> 00:09:53,373
MATT: Yeah, the guy with the throat is the only
one that you have sneak attack on.

174
00:09:53,373 --> 00:09:54,830
TRAVIS: 15.

175
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,181
MATT: 15 hits.

176
00:09:56,181 --> 00:10:01,165
TRAVIS: Nice. That does seven points of piercing
damage.

177
00:10:01,165 --> 00:10:02,631
MATT: All right.

178
00:10:02,631 --> 00:10:09,710
TRAVIS: Are we hopping off down a cliff, or are we
running in toward where they are?

179
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:13,901
MATT: That's up to you. They're about 25 feet down
below on this cliff.

180
00:10:13,901 --> 00:10:15,825
TRAVIS: I'm going to stay up on my perch.

181
00:10:15,825 --> 00:10:18,554
MATT: Okay, stay up on your perch. Got you. You
still have a bonus action if you wanted to hide.

182
00:10:18,554 --> 00:10:22,521
TRAVIS: But I can only hide or disengage or--

183
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:26,751
LAURA: You could hide so they can't see you.

184
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:29,211
TRAVIS: Oh, well, let them see me.

185
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:32,032
MATT: All right, there you go. So Skak is up in
the open. Mozuu, you're up.

186
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:37,741
DARIN: Okay. I am going to keep ripping at the
man's-- Well, not the man. I'm going to keep

187
00:10:37,741 --> 00:10:38,700
ripping him.

188
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,723
MATT: The uruk, so go ahead for the attack.

189
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:43,248
DARIN: Oh, for the love of Pete's Dragon. Five.

190
00:10:43,248 --> 00:10:46,722
MATT: Five. You go to bite and this time it's
reached over and it's grabbed a blade and a dagger.

191
00:10:46,722 --> 00:10:51,056
It jams the pommel up into your mouth and it hits
the roof of your mouth. (gagging) You're now being

192
00:10:51,056 --> 00:10:56,171
partially choked by its blade, by the hilt of its
blade. So your first strike does not hit it. You

193
00:10:56,171 --> 00:10:57,391
want to try a second time?

194
00:10:57,391 --> 00:11:00,251
DARIN: Yes. And I have a blade in my mouth?

195
00:11:00,251 --> 00:11:05,722
MATT: You have the pommel and hilt jammed up into
your jaw and it's trying to keep you at bay.

196
00:11:05,722 --> 00:11:10,561
DARIN: I'm going to try and jab the pommel in its
eye. No, it's not stuck in my mouth, right?

197
00:11:10,561 --> 00:11:12,489
MATT: Not at the moment, but you could bite down
if you wanted.

198
00:11:12,489 --> 00:11:16,789
DARIN: All right, I will. For the-- Seven.

199
00:11:16,789 --> 00:11:21,823
MATT: Seven. You try and bite down on it. Actually
breaks a tooth on the inside and you're like,

200
00:11:21,823 --> 00:11:27,591
"Ugh!" You feel the pain sting through your jaw.
This is a stronger uruk than you expected and it's

201
00:11:27,591 --> 00:11:30,568
currently putting up quite a fight. So that ends
your turn, Mozuu?

202
00:11:30,568 --> 00:11:31,737
DARIN: Ends my turn.

203
00:11:31,737 --> 00:11:36,627
MATT: All right. Arby and this group are all going
at the same time. So what are you doing, Arby?

204
00:11:36,627 --> 00:11:44,597
LAURA: I'm going to jump down. I'm going to run at
them and attack the one that's got him.

205
00:11:44,597 --> 00:11:51,305
MATT: Okay. So as you leap, make an acrobatics
check.

206
00:11:51,305 --> 00:11:52,603
LAURA: Oh no.

207
00:11:52,603 --> 00:11:53,892
TRAVIS: How far? 25 feet down?

208
00:11:53,892 --> 00:11:55,216
MATT: 25 feet, yeah.

209
00:11:55,216 --> 00:11:57,591
LAURA: Four!

210
00:11:57,591 --> 00:12:02,750
TRAVIS: Plus anything? Oh no!

211
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,732
MATT: Mozuu, make a dexterity saving throw.

212
00:12:04,732 --> 00:12:06,532
TRAVIS: Oh, no way.

213
00:12:06,532 --> 00:12:13,873
DARIN: 18 plus-- that's a
19.

214
00:12:13,873 --> 00:12:18,052
MATT: Okay. So you suffer seven points of
bludgeoning damage as you fall from the cliffside

215
00:12:18,052 --> 00:12:23,992
above. As you fall, you land like a large
cannonball, right in the space where Mozuu was.

216
00:12:23,992 --> 00:12:28,600
Mozuu, at the last minute, mouth filled with gore
and dagger, looks up and sees the shadow

217
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,452
encroaching. Kicks away just as you (impact).

218
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:35,763
LAURA: Slam down with my maul right as I hit the
ground!

219
00:12:35,763 --> 00:12:41,344
MATT: You land right on the guy he had. So you
slam the maul into the ground, because you don't

220
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:45,751
know where he is. You look around for a moment to
look down and realize that your feet are six

221
00:12:45,751 --> 00:12:52,804
inches deep into the torso of this once-living orc
that has been splattered on the ledge. All right.

222
00:12:52,804 --> 00:12:55,774
LAURA: I'll use my second attack to hit another
one!

223
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,282
MATT: All right, go for it.

224
00:12:57,282 --> 00:12:59,173
TRAVIS: You are slaughtering today.

225
00:12:59,173 --> 00:13:03,482
LAURA: I'm screaming as I'm doing it. 24!

226
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:05,044
MATT: 24 hits.

227
00:13:05,044 --> 00:13:13,035
LAURA: Deet de deet de deet. Ooh, ah! 15!

228
00:13:13,035 --> 00:13:25,473
MATT: 15? All right. That'll destroy him. All
right, so. So it was seven from that one to, okay.

229
00:13:25,473 --> 00:13:31,568
As you land and crush him, you swing wide with
your giant maul and it hits one and pins it

230
00:13:31,568 --> 00:13:36,084
against the wall. It hits it and slams against the
wall. You watch it splatter across the side,

231
00:13:36,084 --> 00:13:37,674
destroyed.

232
00:13:37,674 --> 00:13:39,634
LAURA: Like a gnat, that one! Ha ha, ha!

233
00:13:39,634 --> 00:13:45,653
MATT: All right, that'll end your turn, Arby? As
that's happening, the orcs are getting up and

234
00:13:45,653 --> 00:13:51,273
grabbing their weapons. There are the two still
sleeping. As all this is happening, they're

235
00:13:51,273 --> 00:13:57,142
(snoring) in the middle of their bedroll. These
two other ones that are wounded are going to stand

236
00:13:57,142 --> 00:14:01,884
up. They're both going to go after you since
you're the one who just arrived aggressively. The

237
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:05,117
first one's going to swing at you.

238
00:14:05,117 --> 00:14:06,594
TRAVIS: Frustrated DM.

239
00:14:06,594 --> 00:14:08,057
MATT: That's a ten.

240
00:14:08,057 --> 00:14:09,123
LAURA: No.

241
00:14:09,123 --> 00:14:14,014
MATT: The side of their battleaxe, clang! Against
your armor, no effect. A natural 20!

242
00:14:14,014 --> 00:14:18,373
TRAVIS: There's the make-up. There it is.

243
00:14:18,373 --> 00:14:21,273
LAURA: That's a load of shrak, that is!

244
00:14:21,273 --> 00:14:25,244
MATT: One on a d10, so that's two plus-- You take
five points of slashing damage from its critical

245
00:14:25,244 --> 00:14:31,897
hit. You deflect it with a chuckle, your giant
olog-hai physical self able to withstand such

246
00:14:31,897 --> 00:14:35,154
paltry blows. You're called Unstoppable for a
reason.

247
00:14:35,154 --> 00:14:37,444
LAURA: That's right. Unbreakable. That's me.

248
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:42,148
MATT: All right, so. That ends the orc's turn
there, the one you crushed there, the one that's

249
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:51,238
sleeping. Yeah, they don't get a saving throw
until they get hit or the spell ends. Fun. All

250
00:14:51,238 --> 00:14:58,506
right. There's a third orc right now that's
backing away. Hands up, full belly shown, like

251
00:14:58,506 --> 00:14:59,844
(heavy breathing).

252
00:14:59,844 --> 00:15:01,348
LAURA: Kill the weak one!

253
00:15:01,348 --> 00:15:04,980
MATT: "No, no no!" Eden, your turn.

254
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,517
SAM: I will jump on the weak one.

255
00:15:06,517 --> 00:15:10,694
MATT: Roll an acrobatics check, please.

256
00:15:10,694 --> 00:15:16,475
SAM: Oh boy. Check? 15.

257
00:15:16,475 --> 00:15:22,340
MATT: 15, all right. You land on it without issue
and you actually reduce the damage from the impact

258
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:26,802
to two. You only take two points of bludgeoning
damage from the fall as you land on top of it. Go

259
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:29,390
ahead and roll a d4. Add your strength modifier.

260
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,721
SAM: d4, add strength.

261
00:15:31,721 --> 00:15:35,519
MATT: Oh god, which one is it?

262
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,619
SAM: Three, plus strength is one. So four!

263
00:15:40,619 --> 00:15:45,467
MATT: Four, so. You land and it slams onto the
ground. We'll see if it manages-- Nope! It's

264
00:15:45,467 --> 00:15:51,590
knocked prone. So it falls onto the ground. You're
on top of it currently. Felt a bone snap somewhere

265
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:55,788
in its ribcage, the back of its shoulder blade.
It's currently pinned onto the ground underneath you.

266
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:59,270
SAM: I will take my quarterstaff and-- like
churning butter.

267
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:08,537
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll some attacks.
It is considered prone, so you have advantage on

268
00:16:08,537 --> 00:16:10,238
your attacks against it.

269
00:16:10,238 --> 00:16:13,720
SAM: Good, because that was a two. And that's a
natural 20!

270
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,890
MATT: Oh, shit! Okay, so roll your first attack
damage.

271
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:20,150
SAM: d8, seven, plus four. 11.

272
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:23,875
LAURA: Wait, seven times two, because it was a
critical. So 14.

273
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:26,131
SAM: 14 plus four is 18.

274
00:16:26,131 --> 00:16:31,899
MATT: Okay, so the first hit, as you jam down, you
go to stir it. You hit right at the base of the

275
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:36,010
skull and the neck breaks immediately. But you
feel like you still have to go through the motion

276
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:39,996
so you still stir inside, even though it's not
living. The body's limp and being pushed around in

277
00:16:39,996 --> 00:16:42,470
a circle. You're like, (yelling in disgust).

278
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,711
TRAVIS: What's it look like, being pushed around
in a circle?

279
00:16:44,711 --> 00:16:48,410
MATT: (yelling) About like that. So that's your
first strike.

280
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,120
SAM: Well, is he dead?

281
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,108
MATT: Yes. He's very dead.

282
00:16:53,108 --> 00:17:00,371
SAM: Orc physiology is not my specialty. Do I see
other orcs? Uruks, around me?

283
00:17:00,371 --> 00:17:05,702
MATT: There are two sleeping and there is one that
was first struck by you with your crossbow, that

284
00:17:05,702 --> 00:17:09,150
was wounded, but it's still standing and its
blade's out.

285
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,959
SAM: I get one more attack, right?

286
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,155
MATT: You do.

287
00:17:12,155 --> 00:17:16,895
SAM: I will move to that one and hit him. Right?

288
00:17:16,895 --> 00:17:20,450
MATT: Okay, what's your movement?

289
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:21,421
SAM: 40.

290
00:17:21,421 --> 00:17:24,311
MATT: Actually, yes. You would have enough,
because you are quicker than the other. So you

291
00:17:24,311 --> 00:17:26,857
have enough speed to get right up to him. Go ahead
and make your second attack.

292
00:17:26,857 --> 00:17:28,421
LAURA: You're so speedy.

293
00:17:28,421 --> 00:17:29,697
SAM: Not with advantage?

294
00:17:29,697 --> 00:17:30,800
MATT: No.

295
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,887
SAM: That's probably a miss. It's a nine.

296
00:17:32,887 --> 00:17:39,230
MATT: Yep. This one sees you crush his friend and
stir him up a bit, and prepares itself. As you

297
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:44,198
rush toward, darts out of the way and dodge-rolls
beyond your attack. No effect.

298
00:17:44,198 --> 00:17:51,316
SAM: It's a wraith! It's a grave-walker! They can
disappear at will!

299
00:17:51,316 --> 00:17:54,410
MATT: All right, so, that ends Eden's turn. Skak,
you're up first.

300
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:58,222
TRAVIS: The last one that remains un-asleep:
crossbow.

301
00:17:58,222 --> 00:17:59,414
MATT: Go for it.

302
00:17:59,414 --> 00:18:02,041
TRAVIS: Nice. Is he now within melee of him?

303
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:03,500
MATT: He is, yes.

304
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:14,544
TRAVIS: 17, so I'll use my sneak attack. 12,
that's an eight. 12, 16, 20!

305
00:18:14,544 --> 00:18:18,381
MATT: Yeah, between the damage he already took--
This one, the arrow strikes right in the abdomen.

306
00:18:18,381 --> 00:18:24,486
It clutches it, gets the axe up to its side, and
you see it, with its final bit of strength, trying

307
00:18:24,486 --> 00:18:30,048
to strike a blow toward your olog friend over
there, but crumples to the ground and bleeds out

308
00:18:30,048 --> 00:18:31,513
from its abdomen.

309
00:18:31,513 --> 00:18:33,431
SAM: Thanks, Skak!

310
00:18:33,431 --> 00:18:41,223
TRAVIS: Yeah. Now, quiet-- I'm looking at you--
quietly kill the other, and leave one for

311
00:18:41,223 --> 00:18:42,659
questioning!

312
00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:44,704
SAM: Kill the other? There's two asleep.

313
00:18:44,704 --> 00:18:47,963
LAURA: I walk over and use my maul and smash down
on one of the ones that's sleeping.

314
00:18:47,963 --> 00:18:52,552
MATT: Okay, make an attack with advantage. It's an
auto-crit because it is incapacitated.

315
00:18:52,552 --> 00:18:57,896
LAURA: Ooh, 16 plus eight, so that's definitely
going to hit, and it's not a crit.

316
00:18:57,896 --> 00:19:01,703
MATT: No, it is a crit. It's an auto-crit because
it's right there. Actually, you wouldn't even have

317
00:19:01,703 --> 00:19:09,203
to roll because, when it's incapacitated. No,
attack rolls have advantage, you're right. And

318
00:19:09,203 --> 00:19:12,672
within five feet, it's a critical hit. So yeah,
you did hit and you have a crit.

319
00:19:12,672 --> 00:19:16,637
TRAVIS: Re-roll that. That'll do.

320
00:19:16,637 --> 00:19:19,547
LAURA: Yeah! 20 plus five, 25!

321
00:19:19,547 --> 00:19:28,291
MATT: (snoring) (impact) Scattered. Gallagher
performance. All of you are like (splatter).

322
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:30,772
SAM: A good kill.

323
00:19:30,772 --> 00:19:38,173
MATT: The one sleeping now has this section of
hand that slopped onto its head. Pulls it in,

324
00:19:38,173 --> 00:19:40,565
cuddles with the disembodied orc arm.

325
00:19:40,565 --> 00:19:42,454
TRAVIS: Sucks the thumb.

326
00:19:42,454 --> 00:19:45,438
SAM: Sucking somebody else's thumb! That's so
gross!

327
00:19:45,438 --> 00:19:51,205
TRAVIS: How do I get down? I'm tiny!

328
00:19:51,205 --> 00:19:53,553
LAURA: Here! I'll catch you!

329
00:19:53,553 --> 00:19:58,942
SAM: We'll catch you, just come down. Oh, wait! I
have a blanket. Let's spread it out and we'll hold

330
00:19:58,942 --> 00:20:01,213
it, and you can jump down on the blanket.

331
00:20:01,213 --> 00:20:03,242
TRAVIS: Don't let me fall!

332
00:20:03,242 --> 00:20:07,141
LAURA: No, of course not! Right as he jumps, I let
go and start picking my nose.

333
00:20:07,141 --> 00:20:09,623
MATT: Make an acrobatics check.

334
00:20:09,623 --> 00:20:16,954
TRAVIS: Oh no. Oh, hey! 17! Trickster rogues, man,
okay!

335
00:20:16,954 --> 00:20:25,143
MATT: All right, so, as you leap off and watch one
of three taut points on it vanish, you flap your

336
00:20:25,143 --> 00:20:30,624
arms really fast to try and maneuver through the
air. You manage to hit some tension on their side

337
00:20:30,624 --> 00:20:37,015
and roll off. You only suffer three points of
bludgeoning damage as you roll on the ground. As

338
00:20:37,015 --> 00:20:39,924
you land, I want you to roll a constitution saving
throw.

339
00:20:39,924 --> 00:20:42,668
SAM: What's that all about? Oh, I know what it
is.

340
00:20:42,668 --> 00:20:44,735
TRAVIS: Oh, that's not good. That's a six.

341
00:20:44,735 --> 00:20:51,941
MATT: All right, so, as you roll and land, the
sleeping powder seems to have worn off. The one

342
00:20:51,941 --> 00:20:55,515
that's on the ground, clutching and sucking on the
thumb of the disembodied uruk arm goes,

343
00:20:55,515 --> 00:21:07,889
(sniffing and grunting) (confused noises) (cry of alarm).

344
00:21:07,889 --> 00:21:09,407
TRAVIS: Grab him!

345
00:21:09,407 --> 00:21:10,882
SAM: We're not to kill him?

346
00:21:10,882 --> 00:21:12,225
TRAVIS: No! Question him!

347
00:21:12,225 --> 00:21:16,723
DARIN: We will question him, and we will question
him in the patented way we always question

348
00:21:16,723 --> 00:21:21,934
individuals, when we all speak as one!

349
00:21:21,934 --> 00:21:24,003
SAM, LAURA, and TRAVIS: As one!

350
00:21:24,003 --> 00:21:26,962
SAM, DARIN, and LAURA: Don't bite his throat.

351
00:21:26,962 --> 00:21:28,552
DARIN: Right.

352
00:21:28,552 --> 00:21:32,211
TRAVIS: You, strong people, grapple him!

353
00:21:32,211 --> 00:21:33,532
SAM: I will grapple him!

354
00:21:33,532 --> 00:21:35,503
MATT: Make an athletics check.

355
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:38,767
SAM: Not good. Nine.

356
00:21:38,767 --> 00:21:44,117
MATT: Natural 19. As you go to grab, he goes
(yelling), pulls away. You can attempt to make

357
00:21:44,117 --> 00:21:47,142
another, if you want. You get two attacks. You can
make one per attack.

358
00:21:47,142 --> 00:21:50,664
SAM: That's right. This one is, it's an athletics
check? 13.

359
00:21:50,664 --> 00:21:55,761
MATT: 13. Yeah, no, he's like, (grunting), pushes
away from you twice. This slimy little orc is now

360
00:21:55,761 --> 00:21:56,925
freaked out.

361
00:21:56,925 --> 00:21:59,782
LAURA: I start grabbing at him like it's a piece
of paper blowing in the wind.

362
00:21:59,782 --> 00:22:03,768
MATT: Make an athletics check. It's like (slurping
sounds).

363
00:22:03,768 --> 00:22:08,506
LAURA: Oh no! Athletics, or what? Athletics is
ten.

364
00:22:08,506 --> 00:22:15,185
MATT: Ten. Nope! It's like grabbing the soap.
Boop, boop, boop! It keeps slipping out of your

365
00:22:15,185 --> 00:22:16,655
grasp and it's crawling on the ground.

366
00:22:16,655 --> 00:22:18,015
LAURA: 25!

367
00:22:18,015 --> 00:22:23,145
MATT: 25. Okay, yeah, that'll do it. It slips past
each one, crawling on the ground,

368
00:22:23,145 --> 00:22:27,505
(heavy breathing) (clunk) "Ugh!" You get the ankle and
you pull it back in. Slides onto his back and is

369
00:22:27,505 --> 00:22:31,995
like, (panicked yelling) underneath this giant
olog body, covered in armor, that's towering over

370
00:22:31,995 --> 00:22:33,845
it. Looking up at you, Arby, like--

371
00:22:33,845 --> 00:22:36,740
LAURA: We're going to ask you some questions.

372
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:39,673
TRAVIS: All together, right? One, two--

373
00:22:39,673 --> 00:22:59,747
ALL: --Three. Who do you serve? We are the Forcs!
Who do you serve? Not meaning food! Because we are

374
00:22:59,747 --> 00:23:01,615
the Forcs!

375
00:23:01,615 --> 00:23:04,772
MATT: Somebody make an intimidation check.

376
00:23:04,772 --> 00:23:07,534
TRAVIS: Not me.

377
00:23:07,534 --> 00:23:10,702
SAM: I will intimidate. Natural one.

378
00:23:10,702 --> 00:23:12,287
LAURA: Seven.

379
00:23:12,287 --> 00:23:14,736
TRAVIS: Nine.

380
00:23:14,736 --> 00:23:17,138
DARIN: (softly) Two.

381
00:23:17,138 --> 00:23:19,392
TRAVIS: Oh my god. Are you serious?

382
00:23:19,392 --> 00:23:29,084
MATT: After this display, the uruk on the ground
goes, (bursts into laughter). "What is this? What,

383
00:23:29,084 --> 00:23:35,656
"the Forcs? Really? (giggling) Just kill me."

384
00:23:35,656 --> 00:23:38,866
SAM: I guess we have to kill him.

385
00:23:38,866 --> 00:23:40,341
TRAVIS: Give him pain.

386
00:23:40,341 --> 00:23:41,386
SAM: Pain?

387
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:42,410
TRAVIS: Pain.

388
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:49,286
LAURA: I lift him up, hanging by his ankle. Do we
want to use him as a piñata?

389
00:23:49,286 --> 00:23:57,666
SAM: It's multicultural. Sure! I'll take out my
length of chain and sort of start whipping him.

390
00:23:57,666 --> 00:24:00,868
MATT: (shrieking)

391
00:24:00,868 --> 00:24:04,696
LAURA: Who do you serve? Who do you work for?

392
00:24:04,696 --> 00:24:14,423
MATT: "My! Name's! Borg! Please, stop it! I'm
Borg!"

393
00:24:14,423 --> 00:24:18,029
LAURA &amp; DARIN: Borg. Borg? Borg borg.

394
00:24:18,029 --> 00:24:25,259
LAURA: Who sent you? Where are you from? Who do
you work for?

395
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:27,219
SAM: We're looking for Ur-Gram.

396
00:24:27,219 --> 00:24:29,785
MATT: "I know Ur-Gram!"

397
00:24:29,785 --> 00:24:32,519
SAM: You do! Where's Ur-Gram?

398
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:36,379
MATT: (stuttering) "I could tell you. I could show
you!"

399
00:24:36,379 --> 00:24:38,150
LAURA: All right! I drop him.

400
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:51,348
MATT: "Oh! (groaning) Okay. I could show you. So.
Just know, Ur-Gram is strange. He's a fanatic. Bit

401
00:24:51,348 --> 00:24:54,608
"of a creepy individual."

402
00:24:54,608 --> 00:25:03,724
LAURA: Should we take a short rest while we talk
about him? Can I sit down? I'm going to sit down

403
00:25:03,724 --> 00:25:05,929
and listen to what he's saying.

404
00:25:05,929 --> 00:25:12,330
MATT: This uruk, which at a close glance is small,
it's borderline goblin in how thin and tiny it is,

405
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:24,651
sits up on his feet. (wheezing) "A fanatic,
Ur-Gram is. Near death once, he was! Now works for

406
00:25:24,651 --> 00:25:32,768
"some tark who walks like the wraiths do. The
Bright Lord, he is. Marks all his gobs with his

407
00:25:32,768 --> 00:25:40,698
"hand, he does. I don't question, though. Ur-Gram
can break any of us. I've seen it, I have."

408
00:25:40,698 --> 00:25:44,488
LAURA: He can't break me. I'm unbreakable.

409
00:25:44,488 --> 00:25:46,047
MATT: "That's good."

410
00:25:46,047 --> 00:25:48,588
TRAVIS: You said he works for the Bright Lord?

411
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:54,150
MATT: "The Bright Lord, aye. I've seen him around.
He's just some stupid man-filth."

412
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:55,693
TRAVIS: Pig-skin!

413
00:25:55,693 --> 00:25:57,109
SAM: Soft-skin!

414
00:25:57,109 --> 00:25:59,269
LAURA: Man-swine!

415
00:25:59,269 --> 00:26:02,785
SAM: Sure, sure, those are all good ones.

416
00:26:02,785 --> 00:26:05,360
DARIN: What other ones can we use?

417
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,668
SAM: Man-filth! Man-beast!

418
00:26:07,668 --> 00:26:10,140
MATT: "I already said man-filth."

419
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:18,459
DARIN: Now, what other insults could we use, all
together, in one voice? In our traditional way?

420
00:26:18,459 --> 00:26:22,239
MATT: "Please, don't. Borg is asking you."

421
00:26:22,239 --> 00:26:27,750
DARIN: You see, we're tougher than your master.
You said creepy? Who's creepier than the Forcs?

422
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,906
You can answer.

423
00:26:29,906 --> 00:26:31,340
MATT: "No one?"

424
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,720
SAM: Correct answer.

425
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:41,510
DARIN: There's two things I know. We are the
creepiest, and that's it.

426
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:44,011
MATT: (whimpering)

427
00:26:44,011 --> 00:26:48,908
TRAVIS: So Ur-Gram works for the Bright Lord and
can bend anyone to his will?

428
00:26:48,908 --> 00:26:52,948
MATT: "Well, didn't bend me. Didn't ask."

429
00:26:52,948 --> 00:26:54,558
SAM: Where is he?

430
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:56,062
MATT: "I'll show you."

431
00:26:56,062 --> 00:27:02,335
LAURA: Can you show us in 30 minutes? Because I
want to take a short break.

432
00:27:02,335 --> 00:27:05,332
MATT: "Sure, take your rest."

433
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:08,073
SAM: If we rest, what if they send a patrol up
here?

434
00:27:08,073 --> 00:27:11,142
LAURA: We'll pretend that we're the guards that we
just killed.

435
00:27:11,142 --> 00:27:17,072
TRAVIS: You lead us to Ur-Gram, we'll rest for a
minute, and then when you lead us we'll let you leave!

436
00:27:17,072 --> 00:27:19,051
MATT: "Okay."

437
00:27:19,051 --> 00:27:22,601
LAURA: I'm going to use him as a pillow as I take
a short rest.

438
00:27:22,601 --> 00:27:28,006
TRAVIS: I'm going to bind his hands first, and
then I'm going to stick some dirty garments

439
00:27:28,006 --> 00:27:32,022
hanging off of Eden in his mouth, to gag him up.

440
00:27:32,022 --> 00:27:39,810
DARIN: You have a choice, mate. You could join us.
Every Forc, as has been proven by science, has

441
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:47,405
five forky things. We are but four! If you join
us, we will be five.

442
00:27:47,405 --> 00:27:48,874
LAURA: No, but then we'd be--

443
00:27:48,874 --> 00:27:50,730
SAM: --the Fircs.

444
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:59,323
LAURA: Doesn't work as well. If you join us, you
could be my pillow as long as you want.

445
00:27:59,323 --> 00:28:01,350
MATT: (muffled whimpering)

446
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,091
TRAVIS: Hold on. I take out the--

447
00:28:03,091 --> 00:28:07,464
LAURA: I fluff him up and lay down.

448
00:28:07,464 --> 00:28:10,791
MATT: (yelps of pain) You break a few bones in the
process.

449
00:28:10,791 --> 00:28:16,720
TRAVIS: I should gag him back up. I walk back over
to Eden and I tear off a bit of cloth near the

450
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:23,652
groin area. Yeah, I put it back in. Okay, should
we take a short rest?

451
00:28:23,652 --> 00:28:25,203
SAM: I guess.

452
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:28,972
MATT: All right, so you guys all take a short
rest. You can use any hit dice that are currently

453
00:28:28,972 --> 00:28:30,402
unspent.

454
00:28:30,402 --> 00:28:34,532
SAM: Got to use them all.

455
00:28:34,532 --> 00:28:36,791
TRAVIS: Because you have those hit dice once per
day.

456
00:28:36,791 --> 00:28:40,071
SAM: Back up at full.

457
00:28:40,071 --> 00:28:43,572
MATT: You get your ki back. You get your action
surge back.

458
00:28:43,572 --> 00:28:46,893
DARIN: Almost full.

459
00:28:46,893 --> 00:28:48,874
LAURA: Almost full, not quite.

460
00:28:48,874 --> 00:28:52,909
MATT: All right. At the end of this rest, as
you're laying back, you hear this silent

461
00:28:52,909 --> 00:28:55,671
whimpering as Borg's like (whimpering).

462
00:28:55,671 --> 00:28:57,342
LAURA: It's okay, Borg-borg.

463
00:28:57,342 --> 00:29:01,991
TRAVIS: Oh man, pet names.

464
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:04,425
LAURA: Well, he said his name twice!

465
00:29:04,425 --> 00:29:06,862
TRAVIS: Pet names for our captive.

466
00:29:06,862 --> 00:29:09,131
SAM: Lead us to Ur-Gram.

467
00:29:09,131 --> 00:29:11,034
MATT: "I need to get up first."

468
00:29:11,034 --> 00:29:12,681
TRAVIS: You've got a gag in your mouth.

469
00:29:12,681 --> 00:29:14,118
MATT: (muffled)

470
00:29:14,118 --> 00:29:15,555
TRAVIS: Now hold on!

471
00:29:15,555 --> 00:29:18,273
MATT: "Blah! I need to get up first!"

472
00:29:18,273 --> 00:29:19,718
SAM: Let him up.

473
00:29:19,718 --> 00:29:21,268
LAURA: All right, I sit up.

474
00:29:21,268 --> 00:29:23,464
MATT: (gasping and heavy breathing)

475
00:29:23,464 --> 00:29:30,458
LAURA: You're very comfy. I start taking his ropes
off him as I pat his little head.

476
00:29:30,458 --> 00:29:32,906
TRAVIS: Oh, why are you untying his hands?

477
00:29:32,906 --> 00:29:35,680
LAURA: Well, because I thought he needs to walk?

478
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,955
TRAVIS: They're on his hands!

479
00:29:37,955 --> 00:29:41,719
LAURA: I don't understand what the problem is.

480
00:29:41,719 --> 00:29:46,941
TRAVIS: Now, I've made him a nice bit of jewelry
for his wrists. Let's leave it on so he feels like

481
00:29:46,941 --> 00:29:48,542
he's part of the group.

482
00:29:48,542 --> 00:29:49,550
LAURA: All right.

483
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:52,396
TRAVIS: Okay. I tie his hands back together. In
front!

484
00:29:52,396 --> 00:29:55,763
LAURA: Should I undo his feet then?

485
00:29:55,763 --> 00:29:57,232
TRAVIS: Those were never tied.

486
00:29:57,232 --> 00:29:58,292
LAURA: Okay.

487
00:29:58,292 --> 00:30:07,113
MATT: As you guys continue eastward under the
cover of night, having crossed over the apex of

488
00:30:07,113 --> 00:30:12,692
this mountain range, you descend down the
treacherous paths and cliffs below. A few hours

489
00:30:12,692 --> 00:30:19,502
downward, continuing with the pushing of Borg
ahead of you, he begins to continuously glance out

490
00:30:19,502 --> 00:30:25,843
in the darkness ahead of you until eventually, you
come around one bend through this small valley

491
00:30:25,843 --> 00:30:33,246
path that's been carved through years and years of
heavy rains and wind that have burrowed this small

492
00:30:33,246 --> 00:30:38,749
walkway through these big cliff-sides. You turn
around the corner and you can see, immediately,

493
00:30:38,749 --> 00:30:46,540
about a dozen or so dotted lights in the distance,
the dark. Maybe a quarter-mile away. There, Borg

494
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:57,067
goes, "That there! That's where he is! That's
where Ur-Gram and the tark have been preparing!"

495
00:30:57,067 --> 00:30:59,620
LAURA: Is the Bright Lord down there?

496
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,074
MATT: "Maybe!"

497
00:31:01,074 --> 00:31:03,103
SAM: How do we get inside?

498
00:31:03,103 --> 00:31:07,108
MATT: "I don't know! I've only had to go outside
of it!"

499
00:31:07,108 --> 00:31:09,115
DARIN: You've never been inside?

500
00:31:09,115 --> 00:31:12,753
MATT: "Oh, well I've been inside, but they let me
in! Don't think they're going to do that for you."

501
00:31:12,753 --> 00:31:15,314
SAM: Is there a password or something?

502
00:31:15,314 --> 00:31:20,675
LAURA: Do all of you wear special hats or
something?

503
00:31:20,699 --> 00:31:30,294
MATT: "I mean--" He looks down at himself and
looks around. "They gave us these." He tugs at the

504
00:31:30,294 --> 00:31:38,246
tunic that he has under his ramshackle, piecemeal
armor. There's this soft grey material that has a

505
00:31:38,246 --> 00:31:45,894
dull grey handprint that's pulled across the
front. He goes, "Maybe this?"

506
00:31:45,894 --> 00:31:49,562
LAURA: That's pretty. I could wear that.

507
00:31:49,562 --> 00:31:51,167
SAM: You're big.

508
00:31:51,167 --> 00:31:57,066
DARIN: You said the other uruk were marked by this
Bright Lord?

509
00:31:57,066 --> 00:31:59,191
MATT: "Well, he gives them like, a--"

510
00:31:59,191 --> 00:32:04,196
DARIN: Does it leave a print on their face?

511
00:32:04,196 --> 00:32:05,814
MATT: "Don't think so."

512
00:32:05,814 --> 00:32:07,708
LAURA: You want me to give it a try?

513
00:32:07,708 --> 00:32:09,033
TRAVIS: Do it.

514
00:32:09,033 --> 00:32:12,399
LAURA: All right, I walk over to Mozuu and slap
him as hard as I can across the face.

515
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,866
DARIN: How many hit points do I lose?

516
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:16,793
MATT: What's your strength modifier?

517
00:32:16,793 --> 00:32:18,506
LAURA: Five.

518
00:32:18,506 --> 00:32:23,953
MATT: Your strength modifier is five? You take six
points of bludgeoning damage to the face, as your

519
00:32:23,953 --> 00:32:27,903
jaw actually disconnects from one side and
(cracking sound).

520
00:32:27,903 --> 00:32:30,163
TRAVIS: You are <i>huge</i>. Oh my gosh.

521
00:32:30,163 --> 00:32:34,627
DARIN: (indistinct)

522
00:32:34,627 --> 00:32:36,954
LAURA: I can't understand you.

523
00:32:36,954 --> 00:32:38,751
TRAVIS: Is that what the mark looks like?

524
00:32:38,751 --> 00:32:42,206
MATT: "Yeah."

525
00:32:42,206 --> 00:32:49,458
TRAVIS: Can I make an insight check to see if he's
lying? Natural 20.

526
00:32:49,458 --> 00:32:55,847
MATT: Yeah, he's totally lying. He has no idea. He
watched you slap the shit out of your friend and

527
00:32:55,847 --> 00:32:57,567
is amused by it.

528
00:32:57,567 --> 00:33:04,527
TRAVIS: I've got an idea. What if we untie him
and he brings us in as new recruits to Ur-Gram?

529
00:33:04,527 --> 00:33:06,267
LAURA: And then what?

530
00:33:06,267 --> 00:33:10,277
TRAVIS: We'll get an audience with him and we cut
his head off! And then we bring it back.

531
00:33:10,277 --> 00:33:12,192
MATT: "I can hear you!"

532
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:14,637
SAM: No, we're not going to cut <i>your</i> head off!

533
00:33:14,637 --> 00:33:15,717
MATT: "Oh, oh!"

534
00:33:15,717 --> 00:33:18,235
LAURA: No, no, the Man-eater. The Face-eater.

535
00:33:18,235 --> 00:33:19,762
MATT: "I could do that! I could help you in."

536
00:33:19,762 --> 00:33:22,477
TRAVIS: And we'll cut you in on the spoils.

537
00:33:22,477 --> 00:33:24,820
LAURA: Good idea!

538
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:32,678
SAM: We're going to get a lot of money for this
mission, and we'll give you one half.

539
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:35,087
MATT: Make a deception check.

540
00:33:35,087 --> 00:33:39,203
TRAVIS: That's me, man! I actually have deception
for once!

541
00:33:39,203 --> 00:33:40,925
SAM: 15!

542
00:33:40,925 --> 00:33:51,096
MATT: He's like, "That's very generous. So then,
to Ur-Gram? Come on."

543
00:33:51,096 --> 00:33:54,338
DARIN: To Ur-Gram! May I fix my jaw?

544
00:33:54,338 --> 00:33:56,128
SAM: Oh, I can fix it! I'm a medic.

545
00:33:56,128 --> 00:33:57,154
DARIN: Thank you.

546
00:33:57,154 --> 00:33:58,557
MATT: Make a medicine check.

547
00:33:58,557 --> 00:34:05,214
SAM: That's cocked. 11 plus medicine? 14.

548
00:34:05,214 --> 00:34:11,620
MATT: 14? It takes a minute, but eventually
(cracking). It's sore. It's swollen. Your face

549
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,068
looks disproportionate.

550
00:34:13,068 --> 00:34:14,812
DARIN: I feel alive.

551
00:34:14,812 --> 00:34:25,779
LAURA: I start yanking his robes off of his hands.
His robes off? His <i>ropes</i> off of his hands. I'll

552
00:34:25,779 --> 00:34:27,775
take his robes off too, just in case.

553
00:34:27,775 --> 00:34:29,724
TRAVIS: Make him naked!

554
00:34:29,724 --> 00:34:33,735
SAM: He needs to have a costume on, for the ruse.

555
00:34:33,735 --> 00:34:39,368
LAURA: All right, I give him his robes back.
Sorry.

556
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:46,993
SAM: Remember, you're bringing us in because we're
new recruits. You're here to see Ur-Gram. No

557
00:34:46,993 --> 00:34:48,189
questions.

558
00:34:48,189 --> 00:34:50,108
TRAVIS: Ferocious warriors, we are.

559
00:34:50,108 --> 00:34:53,918
SAM: The moment you betray us, we will kill you.

560
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:55,097
MATT: "Right."

561
00:34:55,097 --> 00:34:56,398
TRAVIS: Painfully.

562
00:34:56,398 --> 00:34:58,799
SAM: And that's it.

563
00:34:58,799 --> 00:35:06,591
MATT: "Okay, good to know. Follow me!" Begins to
carefully dart around. You guys progress for about

564
00:35:06,591 --> 00:35:10,799
20 or so minutes before you reach the very base of
this mountain. It's now evened out and you're in

565
00:35:10,799 --> 00:35:16,820
this valley, where this small fortress is. The
closer you get, I want you to make a perception check.

566
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:19,167
SAM: All of us?

567
00:35:19,167 --> 00:35:20,653
MATT: All of you guys.

568
00:35:20,653 --> 00:35:23,885
TRAVIS: 17.

569
00:35:23,885 --> 00:35:25,359
SAM: 17 here as well.

570
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,077
LAURA: Ooh, 22.

571
00:35:27,077 --> 00:35:30,628
MATT: All right. Darin?

572
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:31,813
DARIN: Plus what?

573
00:35:31,813 --> 00:35:32,779
MATT: Perception.

574
00:35:32,779 --> 00:35:33,825
LAURA: It's toward the bottom.

575
00:35:33,825 --> 00:35:36,227
DARIN: Oh, 14.

576
00:35:36,227 --> 00:35:42,016
MATT: All right, some decent rolls all around.
Okay, you guys can see, on the other side of this

577
00:35:42,016 --> 00:35:47,262
wide valley, where the torchlights encircle a
fenced, walled encampment, a single ramshackle

578
00:35:47,262 --> 00:35:54,438
watchtower marks the center of the interior of
this large, sharpened pike-like wall. The back

579
00:35:54,438 --> 00:35:58,404
half of the wall is buttressed against the
mountain base, across the valley from you,

580
00:35:58,404 --> 00:36:04,164
vanishing into a large cavern. So it's not a full
encirclement. You see the wall encircles around

581
00:36:04,164 --> 00:36:08,136
the base of the mountain and each side ends at the
mountain. There's an actual natural cavern that

582
00:36:08,136 --> 00:36:12,045
the base of it hides in shadow.

583
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:14,914
LAURA: That's a nice camp. They've got a real nice
camp.

584
00:36:14,914 --> 00:36:17,225
TRAVIS: Location, location, location.

585
00:36:17,225 --> 00:36:20,013
SAM: But do they have grog?

586
00:36:20,013 --> 00:36:21,655
TRAVIS: I hope.

587
00:36:21,655 --> 00:36:32,816
MATT: You had the 22? You also hear, faintly, off
in the distance, this (snuffling and growling).

588
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:38,727
You've heard this sound before. It's kept you up
at night, whenever the caragors in their cages

589
00:36:38,727 --> 00:36:44,375
were particularly rambunctious. It sounds like a
caragor. As soon as you hear it, you also hear a

590
00:36:44,375 --> 00:36:50,096
(alert yelp). A second one, not far from it, goes
(snuffling).

591
00:36:50,096 --> 00:36:53,446
LAURA: There's caragors!

592
00:36:53,446 --> 00:36:58,112
MATT: Yeah, but like, near you. Maybe 40 feet from
you, at the moment.

593
00:36:58,112 --> 00:36:59,594
TRAVIS: Are there trees around us?

594
00:36:59,594 --> 00:37:01,796
MATT: No trees. You're in Mordor right now.

595
00:37:01,796 --> 00:37:06,442
TRAVIS: Yep, just thought I'd ask. You know, some
ashen trees?

596
00:37:06,442 --> 00:37:13,805
MATT: I mean, there are jagged rocks. Part of the
terrain itself is a series of broken shale and

597
00:37:13,805 --> 00:37:17,877
large rock faces that jut out of the ground from
seismic activity.

598
00:37:17,877 --> 00:37:20,883
LAURA: Should we hide behind rocks? It's
caragors.

599
00:37:20,883 --> 00:37:22,558
TRAVIS: You hear caragors?

600
00:37:22,558 --> 00:37:25,456
LAURA: Yeah, like real big-sounding ones.

601
00:37:25,456 --> 00:37:27,353
TRAVIS: Prepare to fight! And I hide.

602
00:37:27,353 --> 00:37:28,974
MATT: Okay, make a stealth check.

603
00:37:28,974 --> 00:37:32,106
SAM: Hide? No, we should sneak past them!

604
00:37:32,106 --> 00:37:36,066
TRAVIS: That's true, we should. 16.

605
00:37:36,066 --> 00:37:41,993
MATT: Okay. So you watch as Skak disappears behind
a rock. What are you guys doing?

606
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:44,847
LAURA: I also try to duck behind a rock.

607
00:37:44,847 --> 00:37:46,399
SAM: Are we going to sit here?

608
00:37:46,399 --> 00:37:51,388
LAURA: I'm going to duck behind a rock and wait
for one to show its face around a rock, and then

609
00:37:51,388 --> 00:37:53,407
I'm going to hit it with my maul.

610
00:37:53,407 --> 00:37:55,367
MATT: Okay, make a stealth check with
disadvantage.

611
00:37:55,367 --> 00:37:57,792
SAM: Why don't we try to go past them?!

612
00:37:57,792 --> 00:38:01,595
LAURA: Seven.

613
00:38:01,595 --> 00:38:13,021
MATT: Okay. You watch as Arby nods, follows suit,
right behind where Skak is. The rock's almost the

614
00:38:13,021 --> 00:38:18,980
size of Arby, so you see this outline of Arby
clutching this rock and trying to act quiet as the

615
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:21,648
armor (clanking).

616
00:38:21,648 --> 00:38:25,788
TRAVIS: Look and see if we can make it past them!
You, stick your head out.

617
00:38:25,788 --> 00:38:32,449
SAM: All right, I will stealthily see if I can see
any caragors. Move out, look around.

618
00:38:32,449 --> 00:38:35,088
MATT: Make a stealth check.

619
00:38:35,088 --> 00:38:39,186
SAM: Ooh! 25!

620
00:38:39,186 --> 00:38:43,138
LAURA: Sneaky sneaky!

621
00:38:43,138 --> 00:38:49,047
MATT: As you climb a little bit of the rock face
on one side of this pathway that's carved into the

622
00:38:49,047 --> 00:38:56,949
mountain base here, you glance up. You can see the
faint bit of moonlight that breaks through one of

623
00:38:56,949 --> 00:39:01,736
the nearby clouds. You can see the outer rim of
two fully-grown caragors that are currently

624
00:39:01,736 --> 00:39:07,698
walking, maybe 15 feet from each other, a dual
hunting scenario. They're both like (sniffing and

625
00:39:07,698 --> 00:39:13,798
grunting) on the ground, and they're smelling for
any sort of possible prey that might be in the

626
00:39:13,798 --> 00:39:15,249
vicinity.

627
00:39:15,249 --> 00:39:19,108
SAM: Hi! We need to distract them somehow. Does
anyone have any meat on them?

628
00:39:19,108 --> 00:39:22,158
LAURA: No, but I have a bell!

629
00:39:22,158 --> 00:39:24,058
SAM: A bell?

630
00:39:24,058 --> 00:39:25,199
LAURA: Yeah.

631
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:26,589
SAM: That would distract?

632
00:39:26,589 --> 00:39:29,036
LAURA: Well, it's a bell! It makes noise.

633
00:39:29,036 --> 00:39:31,409
MATT: (bell clanging) The bell is now ringing in
her hand.

634
00:39:31,409 --> 00:39:34,789
SAM: Throw the bell!

635
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:37,941
LAURA: I throw the bell as far away as I can!

636
00:39:37,941 --> 00:39:42,730
MATT: The caragors at this point (snarling). They
both go jumping and leaping in toward where the

637
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:44,169
source of the bell sound was.

638
00:39:44,169 --> 00:39:45,478
LAURA: I throw the bell!

639
00:39:45,478 --> 00:39:46,763
MATT: Make a strength check.

640
00:39:46,763 --> 00:39:48,932
TRAVIS: Oh my god. Please throw it a mile.

641
00:39:48,932 --> 00:39:51,690
LAURA: 18!

642
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:55,929
MATT: The bell arcs behind where you guys were.

643
00:39:55,929 --> 00:39:57,923
LAURA: Oh wait, no, 15. Because it's not a saving
throw.

644
00:39:57,923 --> 00:40:03,742
MATT: Right. It arcs off behind you and you watch
as one large caragor, nearly 15 feet from end to

645
00:40:03,742 --> 00:40:08,896
end, leaps from the top of the cliff, down into
the ravine behind you, the rock ravine where you

646
00:40:08,896 --> 00:40:13,838
were, and pounces on right where the bell landed.
You hear it ping (crushing). With an impact, you

647
00:40:13,838 --> 00:40:19,366
see rocks get thrown, as it scrapes across the
ground and it tears where the sound source was, it

648
00:40:19,366 --> 00:40:23,569
sits there, tearing at it. The other one comes
right up to the edge to inspect inside. Right over

649
00:40:23,569 --> 00:40:28,295
where you are, it hasn't quite noticed you right
now as you guys are all standing still, the bell

650
00:40:28,295 --> 00:40:30,986
is quickly being noticed to not be anything
fleshy.

651
00:40:30,986 --> 00:40:33,024
LAURA: I look up. Is it like right above the
head?

652
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:35,570
MATT: It's about, maybe, five feet above you right
now.

653
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:39,152
LAURA: So I could take my maul and go like
<i>this!</i>

654
00:40:39,152 --> 00:40:40,700
MATT: Sure.

655
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:44,000
TRAVIS: I could use Mage Hand to create a better
distraction.

656
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,799
LAURA: Too late.

657
00:40:45,799 --> 00:40:47,533
TRAVIS: Yeah.

658
00:40:47,533 --> 00:40:53,212
MATT: Go ahead and roll an attack. You have
advantage on this strike since it's unaware of

659
00:40:53,212 --> 00:40:55,162
your position.

660
00:40:55,162 --> 00:40:56,229
LAURA: 26.

661
00:40:56,229 --> 00:40:57,558
MATT: 26 hits, yeah.

662
00:40:57,558 --> 00:41:04,019
LAURA: (laughing) Aw. 11.

663
00:41:04,019 --> 00:41:09,429
MATT: 11 points of damage, nice. So, as the one
that-- its snout kind of creeped over the edge,

664
00:41:09,429 --> 00:41:15,893
you can see its teeth are this thick underbite of
its jaw pulling open as it's trying to take in

665
00:41:15,893 --> 00:41:20,630
the air both through its nose and its mouth.
(snarling) At which point, out of the darkness,

666
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:28,775
this giant maul head slams right into its snout
and it backs up briefly, and as that happens and

667
00:41:28,775 --> 00:41:33,668
you pull the maul back, it glances down with this
look of absolute hatred and death in its eyes.

668
00:41:33,668 --> 00:41:36,440
(roars)

669
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,740
LAURA: I think it saw us.

670
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:41,139
MATT: You do get a second attack because you did
take the action on this one. And at this point,

671
00:41:41,139 --> 00:41:45,200
the other one spins around from where the bell
was, hearing the pained sound of its ally.

672
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,393
LAURA: 17?

673
00:41:46,393 --> 00:41:47,470
MATT: 17 hits.

674
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:53,780
LAURA: Yes! 12.

675
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:59,830
MATT: 12 points of damage, all righty. So, as it's
gearing up over the side, you take the maul and

676
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:02,866
slam it again. This time it moves its head to the
side and it hits the side of its neck. It's a

677
00:42:02,866 --> 00:42:07,013
heavy hit, and it takes the brunt of it, but it's
<i>so</i> big. I mean, you're pretty big as an

678
00:42:07,013 --> 00:42:10,985
olog-hai. It's probably at least two or more times
the mass of your body.

679
00:42:10,985 --> 00:42:13,048
LAURA: Oh, it's so much bigger than I thought it
was.

680
00:42:13,048 --> 00:42:15,128
TRAVIS: I think you were thinking it was like a
dog.

681
00:42:15,128 --> 00:42:20,560
SAM: Oh, because you didn't play an orc in the
game, so you don't know that these things are

682
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,682
really powerful.

683
00:42:22,682 --> 00:42:23,806
LAURA: No!

684
00:42:23,806 --> 00:42:25,117
TRAVIS: Really terrible.

685
00:42:25,117 --> 00:42:27,708
DARIN: But they can be defeated by a bell.

686
00:42:27,708 --> 00:42:29,818
TRAVIS: It's like a giant liger.

687
00:42:29,818 --> 00:42:33,398
MATT: And on that note, I would like everybody to
roll initiative, please, as these two caragor are

688
00:42:33,398 --> 00:42:36,477
now bearing down on you in this ravine. Oh, okay.

689
00:42:36,477 --> 00:42:39,542
LAURA: We got more of them than they have. It's
okay.

690
00:42:39,542 --> 00:42:41,247
DARIN: 17.

691
00:42:41,247 --> 00:42:42,605
MATT: Oh, nice.

692
00:42:42,605 --> 00:42:44,695
SAM: I think we should try to run.

693
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:49,249
MATT: (laughs) Yeah, these guys don't seem very
fast.

694
00:42:49,249 --> 00:42:50,736
SAM: Six.

695
00:42:50,736 --> 00:42:51,848
LAURA: Oh no.

696
00:42:51,848 --> 00:42:53,437
TRAVIS: Yeah, only four-legged.

697
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:54,736
LAURA: Nine.

698
00:42:54,736 --> 00:42:58,645
TRAVIS: Greyhounds of death. 15.

699
00:42:58,645 --> 00:43:05,017
MATT: All right, Mozuu, you're up first. There's
the one that's up behind you on the path, maybe

700
00:43:05,017 --> 00:43:08,780
about 15, 20 feet from you, and there's the one
that's right above the edge right now that she

701
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:10,424
slammed twice in the face. What are you going to
do?

702
00:43:10,424 --> 00:43:11,797
DARIN: Thunderous Smite.

703
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:14,876
MATT: All right, so you pull forth your war pick,
and you're going to go ahead and strike which one?

704
00:43:14,876 --> 00:43:17,863
DARIN: The one that was closest to Arby.

705
00:43:17,863 --> 00:43:18,978
MATT: Okay.

706
00:43:18,978 --> 00:43:20,607
DARIN: Or I should go for the other one?

707
00:43:20,607 --> 00:43:23,615
MATT: It's a little high for you right now.
Because of her size, she can barely reach it.

708
00:43:23,615 --> 00:43:27,810
You'd have to try and make your way up either
Arby, or climb part of the cliff side. Up to you.

709
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:30,740
DARIN: Do you mind if I climb you?

710
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:31,959
LAURA: Not a bit.

711
00:43:31,959 --> 00:43:33,140
DARIN: I'm going to climb.

712
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:34,410
MATT: Make an athletics check.

713
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:35,820
DARIN: Okay.

714
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:38,896
SAM: That's either a one or a 20.

715
00:43:38,896 --> 00:43:40,631
DARIN: I don't know what that is.

716
00:43:40,631 --> 00:43:42,052
SAM: It's a 20!

717
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:43,521
DARIN: Oh, it's a 20!

718
00:43:43,521 --> 00:43:52,371
MATT: Oh, snap, okay. So, using Arby's body as a
ramp, you begin to leap up from shoulder to back

719
00:43:52,371 --> 00:43:56,690
to shoulder, the top of her head, and jump in the
air, warpick in the sky as you scream to bring it

720
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:59,067
bearing down on the first caragor before you.

721
00:43:59,067 --> 00:44:02,650
DARIN: (yelling) I speak for Sauron!

722
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:05,982
MATT: (laughs) All righty, so, make an attack roll
against it.

723
00:44:05,982 --> 00:44:09,980
DARIN: 16.

724
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,841
MATT: 16 hits! Go ahead and roll for this.

725
00:44:12,841 --> 00:44:15,941
DARIN: I think it's a 1d8 plus three.

726
00:44:15,941 --> 00:44:19,411
MATT: So yes, 1d8 plus three, and then you add an
additional 2d6 thunder damage to the target.

727
00:44:19,411 --> 00:44:29,128
DARIN: That's eight, and the six, that is three,
and that is a one. 12.

728
00:44:29,128 --> 00:44:30,361
MATT: 12 points of damage?

729
00:44:30,361 --> 00:44:31,440
DARIN: Yeah.

730
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,701
MATT: All right, so. As you slam the war pick
right into the front of its snout, it jams into

731
00:44:35,701 --> 00:44:42,971
one nostril and tears through across the side of
its face, releasing this gout of dark purplish-red

732
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:49,303
blood, and as the impact hits, there's a burst of
energy. The sheer force of your anger as you

733
00:44:49,303 --> 00:44:58,041
scream in its face scares it back, and it blows
about ten feet behind you and is knocked prone. It

734
00:44:58,041 --> 00:45:02,081
rolled a natural four plus four, that's eight. And
I believe your spell DC is 11, right?

735
00:45:02,081 --> 00:45:04,503
DARIN: Yes it is. Oh yeah!

736
00:45:04,503 --> 00:45:08,093
MATT: This caragor now gets thrown back ten feet
and is knocked prone on the ground on its side.

737
00:45:08,093 --> 00:45:13,844
It's trying to snap around and get its feet any
sort of purchase to get back up on to the ground,

738
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:16,089
but currently it's open.

739
00:45:16,089 --> 00:45:18,893
DARIN: The Forcs are a powerful team.

740
00:45:18,893 --> 00:45:21,278
TRAVIS: We don't forc around.

741
00:45:21,278 --> 00:45:25,180
MATT: That ends your turn. Okay, so, Skak, you're
up.

742
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:28,885
TRAVIS: Skak. Because it's laying prone, I
probably can't see it from below, right?

743
00:45:28,885 --> 00:45:30,263
MATT: No, you'd have get up.

744
00:45:30,263 --> 00:45:36,528
TRAVIS: I'll aim to the other one that turned at
the sound of pain, and I will use my crossbow to

745
00:45:36,528 --> 00:45:37,693
shoot at it.

746
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:39,948
MATT: All right, go for it. It just turned around.
(growls)

747
00:45:39,948 --> 00:45:43,043
TRAVIS: That's terrible. 12.

748
00:45:43,043 --> 00:45:51,861
MATT: 12. Okay. That does not hit. You turn around
and you fire and it--

749
00:45:51,861 --> 00:45:55,374
TRAVIS: (whimpers) Bonus action! Hide!

750
00:45:55,374 --> 00:45:59,974
MATT: I'll let you move around the rock where you
are and try and hide.

751
00:45:59,974 --> 00:46:03,814
TRAVIS: Okay, fair enough. 18. On stealth.

752
00:46:03,814 --> 00:46:08,374
MATT: Okay. Good to know. All right. That ends
your turn, it's now their turn. So the one that

753
00:46:08,374 --> 00:46:13,075
was knocked prone gets up off the ground. Ten feet
away, it still has enough movement as you're

754
00:46:13,075 --> 00:46:18,915
standing now on the shoulders of Arby. It's going
to go ahead and-- Let's see.

755
00:46:18,915 --> 00:46:25,614
DARIN: And we put on a big coat and pretend we're
one person. And we sneak into a movie theatre.

756
00:46:25,614 --> 00:46:33,893
MATT: It takes a five-foot step back and goes into
a 15-foot leap right towards you. It's a deadly

757
00:46:33,893 --> 00:46:36,714
leap. (snarls) It lunges towards you.

758
00:46:36,714 --> 00:46:40,674
DARIN: Mm-hmm. This was a wonderful game. Thank you
for letting me play.

759
00:46:40,674 --> 00:46:46,495
MATT: Yeah, I need both Mozuu and Arby to make
strength or dexterity saving throw, your choice.

760
00:46:46,495 --> 00:46:48,389
TRAVIS: Get its attention, you can do it.

761
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:50,412
DARIN: That's a 13.

762
00:46:50,412 --> 00:46:51,633
LAURA: 25.

763
00:46:51,633 --> 00:46:59,897
MATT: You succeed, you do not. All right, so. Here
we go.

764
00:46:59,897 --> 00:47:04,874
TRAVIS: All the dice come out. Just all the dice.

765
00:47:04,874 --> 00:47:14,255
MATT: 14 points of bludgeoning and slashing damage
to you, Mozuu, and you are knocked prone as it

766
00:47:14,255 --> 00:47:19,385
lands on top of you, knocking you off of Arby's
shoulders. You are now on the ground with it on

767
00:47:19,385 --> 00:47:23,134
top of you going (snarls). And it's tearing and
biting at you as you are currently pinned to the floor.

768
00:47:23,134 --> 00:47:26,717
DARIN: He's trying to rip out my throat? Sure is
poetic.

769
00:47:26,717 --> 00:47:32,169
MATT: Turnabout's fair play. You take seven points
of damage, Arby, and you are not knocked prone or

770
00:47:32,169 --> 00:47:37,266
thrown off, you manage to keep your weight there.
However, it's partially standing on you now, its

771
00:47:37,266 --> 00:47:41,344
hind legs are up on your back and it's using you
to hold itself as it's currently putting all of

772
00:47:41,344 --> 00:47:46,674
its weight on Mozuu. The other one that was shot
at by Skak is going to go ahead and rush forward

773
00:47:46,674 --> 00:47:54,004
and it's going to go ahead and make a deadly leap
as well. Let's see, all that going on with that

774
00:47:54,004 --> 00:48:01,146
space it's going to have to go after Eden. I need
you to go ahead and make a strength or dexterity

775
00:48:01,146 --> 00:48:02,745
saving throw, your choice.

776
00:48:02,745 --> 00:48:05,216
SAM: I'll choose dexterity, and that's a 21.

777
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:14,950
MATT: 21, all right. Okay, you take six points of
bludgeoning and slashing damage together, and you

778
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:18,940
are not knocked prone. It doesn't pin you in the
space. You just manage to pull out of the way, but

779
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:24,431
it's right up in your face now and your back's
against the rock that he's hiding behind. There's

780
00:48:24,431 --> 00:48:28,413
your friends and the other caragor right behind
you over your shoulders, and this one is right in

781
00:48:28,413 --> 00:48:32,524
front of you right now, slashing and snarling at
you. That's going to end their turn. Arby, you're up.

782
00:48:32,524 --> 00:48:36,508
LAURA: I'm going to spin around and try to hit the
one that's standing on me.

783
00:48:36,508 --> 00:48:38,257
MATT: Okay, that's the one you've hit before, so
go for it.

784
00:48:38,257 --> 00:48:41,885
LAURA: Yeah. Ooh, 26.

785
00:48:41,885 --> 00:48:43,281
MATT: 26 hits!

786
00:48:43,281 --> 00:48:52,224
LAURA: Aw. Dang. Plus seven plus five is 12.

787
00:48:52,224 --> 00:48:57,762
MATT: All righty, so that first hit slams into its
side. You hit it again, you hear the crunch. One

788
00:48:57,762 --> 00:49:00,698
shoulder blade seems to almost buckle a little
bit. It's looking pretty hurt but it's still

789
00:49:00,698 --> 00:49:01,655
standing there.

790
00:49:01,655 --> 00:49:05,030
LAURA: I'm going to try to hit it again. That's a
19.

791
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:06,282
MATT: That hits.

792
00:49:06,282 --> 00:49:11,561
LAURA: 14.

793
00:49:11,561 --> 00:49:19,314
MATT: 14, all righty. And with that, you slam up
your maul a second time. It actually catches it

794
00:49:19,314 --> 00:49:25,091
right underneath the jaw and forces its head to
snap up so fast that its spine seems to break into

795
00:49:25,091 --> 00:49:29,756
place, and with a (whines) it falls limp, the
entirety of its weight sliding off of your

796
00:49:29,756 --> 00:49:33,560
shoulders and onto Mozuu, who is now prone and
pinned underneath it.

797
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:38,131
DARIN: I've gotten the most damage of this entire
game.

798
00:49:38,131 --> 00:49:41,331
LAURA: Eden! Do you want me to try to hit that one
too?

799
00:49:41,331 --> 00:49:43,334
SAM: Yes!

800
00:49:43,334 --> 00:49:46,890
LAURA: I'm going to action surge and try to run up
to the other one and attack it too.

801
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:47,958
TRAVIS: Action surge.

802
00:49:47,958 --> 00:49:50,852
MATT: Okay. So. Taking a little bit there, shoving
it off to the side, you rush up to the one that's

803
00:49:50,852 --> 00:49:52,302
right in the face of Eden. It's a quick jaunt.

804
00:49:52,302 --> 00:49:54,126
LAURA: That's a 24.

805
00:49:54,126 --> 00:49:55,060
MATT: That hits!

806
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:56,791
SAM: You're so powerful.

807
00:49:56,791 --> 00:49:59,371
TRAVIS: Wow.

808
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:00,592
LAURA: Are you kidding me?!

809
00:50:00,592 --> 00:50:02,151
TRAVIS: Double ones both times!

810
00:50:02,151 --> 00:50:03,134
MATT: What?!

811
00:50:03,134 --> 00:50:05,701
LAURA: Sorry, that's seven points of damage.

812
00:50:05,701 --> 00:50:09,774
MATT: All right, seven points of damage. You rush
up and swing at it. This time, it brings its head

813
00:50:09,774 --> 00:50:13,302
back and manages to deflect some of the blow with
the side of its face; not quite doing as much

814
00:50:13,302 --> 00:50:14,867
damage as you'd like.

815
00:50:14,867 --> 00:50:16,770
LAURA: Ooh, natural 20 on the next hit!

816
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:18,882
MATT: Make up for that! There you go!

817
00:50:18,882 --> 00:50:23,283
LAURA: 25 points of damage.

818
00:50:23,283 --> 00:50:27,952
MATT: 25 points of damage! So, while it deflects
the first blow, as it turns its head back to

819
00:50:27,952 --> 00:50:34,381
strike at you, you put your foot up and hold it
right in its jaw to keep it from getting away. You

820
00:50:34,381 --> 00:50:39,302
use that to aim it up and whack right up the side
of its temple. It rings its bell and you watch as

821
00:50:39,302 --> 00:50:44,551
it pulls away, the slobber and blood dripping from
its jaws, shaking its head back and forth from the

822
00:50:44,551 --> 00:50:46,893
pain you just inflicted. I believe that ends your
turn.

823
00:50:46,893 --> 00:50:47,931
LAURA: Yes, it does.

824
00:50:47,931 --> 00:50:49,361
MATT: End of Arby's turn brings it to you, Eden.

825
00:50:49,361 --> 00:50:57,172
SAM: (growling) I will attack relentlessly! 23 to
hit.

826
00:50:57,172 --> 00:50:58,458
MATT: 23 hits!

827
00:50:58,458 --> 00:51:02,488
SAM: That is five points of damage.

828
00:51:02,488 --> 00:51:04,771
TRAVIS: Relentless damage!

829
00:51:04,771 --> 00:51:09,243
SAM: I will use my Flurry of Blows.

830
00:51:09,243 --> 00:51:12,701
MATT: You get two attacks and then you can use
your Flurry.

831
00:51:12,701 --> 00:51:19,318
SAM: Got it. So, second attack doesn't hit. It's
12. So I can't use my Flurry of Blows?

832
00:51:19,318 --> 00:51:20,171
MATT: You can!

833
00:51:20,171 --> 00:51:21,206
SAM: Okay! Flurry of Blows!

834
00:51:21,206 --> 00:51:22,407
MATT: So you get two more attacks.

835
00:51:22,407 --> 00:51:25,766
SAM: That's worse. And 15.

836
00:51:25,766 --> 00:51:26,992
MATT: 15 just barely hits.

837
00:51:26,992 --> 00:51:38,546
SAM: Eight! Plus four is 12 points of damage. Plus
I will choose a condition for it. Strength saving

838
00:51:38,546 --> 00:51:46,209
throw? If it fails, no, it probably is strong.
It's probably dextrous, too. I'm going to choose

839
00:51:46,209 --> 00:51:49,292
that it can't take reactions until the end of my
next turn.

840
00:51:49,292 --> 00:51:53,663
MATT: So it can't take attacks of opportunity.
There you go. Perfect. That ends your turn, Eden.

841
00:51:53,663 --> 00:51:58,722
Mozuu, you're up. Currently prone and pinned under
the dead body of a caragor.

842
00:51:58,722 --> 00:52:00,475
DARIN: May I call for help?

843
00:52:00,475 --> 00:52:01,562
MATT: Yes, you may.

844
00:52:01,562 --> 00:52:08,129
DARIN: I would like to do that. You thought I was
going to say something else, but I would like to

845
00:52:08,129 --> 00:52:14,066
call: Hello? Might I have a bit of aid, please?

846
00:52:14,066 --> 00:52:18,154
MATT: Are you going to attempt to pull your way
out, or are you just waiting for someone to help you?

847
00:52:18,154 --> 00:52:19,533
DARIN: I'm waiting for someone to help me.

848
00:52:19,533 --> 00:52:22,263
MATT: You're holding your action for someone to
aid.

849
00:52:22,263 --> 00:52:23,754
DARIN: I've been beaten up a lot.

850
00:52:23,754 --> 00:52:26,031
TRAVIS: Do we see him under this giant caragor?

851
00:52:26,031 --> 00:52:31,223
MATT: You hear and see, out of the corner of your
eye. You especially see it because you're right

852
00:52:31,223 --> 00:52:34,568
behind the rock and you see his head and shoulders
are right there like, "Help!"

853
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:41,308
DARIN: Excellent. The person who isn't the
strongest! This'll be fun!

854
00:52:41,308 --> 00:52:43,613
TRAVIS: I'm on my way!

855
00:52:43,613 --> 00:52:50,769
MATT: Holding your action for someone to help you.
That brings us to Skak's turn.

856
00:52:50,769 --> 00:53:02,327
TRAVIS: (panicked noises) Can I not help him at
all? I pop back up out of hiding. Can I take aim

857
00:53:02,327 --> 00:53:08,364
with the crossbow again? As a bonus, can I smash a
poison vial on one of my arrows to make it a

858
00:53:08,364 --> 00:53:09,793
poisoned arrow?

859
00:53:09,793 --> 00:53:14,151
MATT: It's an action to poison a weapon. It's more
of a preparation thing.

860
00:53:14,151 --> 00:53:20,102
TRAVIS: I'll keep that in mind. Crossbow! Natural
20!

861
00:53:20,102 --> 00:53:25,570
MATT: Oh shit! Roll your dice and then add the
modifiers after you double it.

862
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:27,530
TRAVIS: Six.

863
00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:29,033
LAURA: Plus your sneak attack.

864
00:53:29,033 --> 00:53:31,368
TRAVIS: Is it sneak attack? Is he within melee of
the other ones?

865
00:53:31,368 --> 00:53:33,100
MATT: Yeah, they've both been bashing it.

866
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:46,182
TRAVIS: Excellent. Oh god. 16. 24.

867
00:53:46,182 --> 00:53:50,443
LAURA: You're supposed to double your dice, all of
your dice.

868
00:53:50,443 --> 00:53:54,244
TRAVIS: 26. That one's supposed to be doubled too,
right?

869
00:53:54,244 --> 00:53:55,070
LAURA: Yep.

870
00:53:55,070 --> 00:53:56,204
TRAVIS: Okay. 26.

871
00:53:56,204 --> 00:54:07,095
MATT: 26 points of damage. All right. Yeah. As you
peek out of hiding, you see it snapping and

872
00:54:07,095 --> 00:54:16,695
snarling at both of your friends over on the side.
You take a moment and slow your breathing. (heartbeats)

873
00:54:16,726 --> 00:54:21,984
And release the crossbow bolt. You watch
behind as it streaks forward between your friends.

874
00:54:21,984 --> 00:54:27,851
The caragor turns, opening its jaw to snap over
Arby and it goes right in the back of the throat,

875
00:54:27,851 --> 00:54:36,764
up into the brain and it collapses to the ground,
no longer moving.

876
00:54:36,764 --> 00:54:39,563
TRAVIS: Oh, are you okay, Mozuu?

877
00:54:39,563 --> 00:54:41,783
DARIN: Yes.

878
00:54:41,783 --> 00:54:43,773
LAURA and SAM: Mozuu?

879
00:54:43,773 --> 00:54:46,851
DARIN: I am a talking caragor!

880
00:54:46,851 --> 00:54:49,994
LAURA: I walk over and try to push the caragor.

881
00:54:49,994 --> 00:54:57,686
MATT: Since you're not in immediate danger, it
takes you a minute or so. You all manage to push

882
00:54:57,686 --> 00:55:03,323
this giant caragor corpse off of Mozuu's body.
You're sore, you're crushed, you're sweaty and

883
00:55:03,323 --> 00:55:05,445
covered in blood, but you're now standing.

884
00:55:05,445 --> 00:55:08,223
LAURA: See! That wasn't so bad!

885
00:55:08,223 --> 00:55:11,014
SAM: Is our prisoner still around, or did he run
away?

886
00:55:11,014 --> 00:55:12,954
MATT: Make a perception check.

887
00:55:12,954 --> 00:55:14,858
LAURA: Oh, I forgot we even had him!

888
00:55:14,858 --> 00:55:17,385
SAM: Oh, perception! 21!

889
00:55:17,385 --> 00:55:22,494
MATT: 21. He is quite a ways down the walkway
sprinting away.

890
00:55:22,494 --> 00:55:23,867
SAM: I could catch him!

891
00:55:23,867 --> 00:55:24,947
TRAVIS: Can you?

892
00:55:24,947 --> 00:55:25,872
SAM: I can!

893
00:55:25,872 --> 00:55:27,044
LAURA: Let's take off after him.

894
00:55:27,044 --> 00:55:30,893
SAM: I'm going to sprint after him using Step of
the Wind.

895
00:55:30,893 --> 00:55:37,257
MATT: You're going to use another ki point. With
your speed and double dash, as he's sprinting.

896
00:55:37,257 --> 00:55:44,305
(heavy panting) About a minute later or so, you
catch up right behind him and he's within grasp of

897
00:55:44,305 --> 00:55:48,504
you. He hasn't noticed you, he's just eyes on the
prize right towards the fortress.

898
00:55:48,504 --> 00:55:51,444
SAM: I grab the top of his skull.

899
00:55:51,444 --> 00:55:54,791
MATT: Make an athletics check to grapple him.

900
00:55:54,791 --> 00:55:57,391
SAM: Athletics? 17.

901
00:55:57,391 --> 00:56:03,377
MATT: 17. You grab him by the back of the head and
he gets yanked out from under his feet and slams

902
00:56:03,377 --> 00:56:06,877
into the ground. You're still clutching him. You
pick him up. He's dangling now from your giant

903
00:56:06,877 --> 00:56:08,495
olog mitts.

904
00:56:08,495 --> 00:56:10,738
SAM: Can't run from the Forcs!

905
00:56:10,738 --> 00:56:16,886
MATT: "I was running from the caragors!
Self-preservation, mate!"

906
00:56:16,886 --> 00:56:21,776
SAM: That makes sense. All right, we'll wait here
for the others and then we follow this plan.

907
00:56:21,776 --> 00:56:22,656
MATT: "Yes!"

908
00:56:22,656 --> 00:56:23,696
SAM: You're on our side.

909
00:56:23,696 --> 00:56:24,618
MATT: "Of course!"

910
00:56:24,618 --> 00:56:25,796
SAM: I trust you implicitly.

911
00:56:25,796 --> 00:56:27,289
MATT: "Don't worry!"

912
00:56:27,289 --> 00:56:30,071
SAM: I don't worry about anything.

913
00:56:30,071 --> 00:56:33,026
TRAVIS: Can we see if he's killing him or having a
chat?

914
00:56:33,026 --> 00:56:37,256
MATT: Make a perception check.

915
00:56:37,256 --> 00:56:41,377
TRAVIS: Nope! Two!

916
00:56:41,377 --> 00:56:45,050
MATT: You see him grabbing him by the head and
pulling him in and you see a bit of a struggle.

917
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:46,997
LAURA: You should probably shoot him.

918
00:56:46,997 --> 00:56:47,946
TRAVIS: He's killing him.

919
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:48,801
LAURA: Yeah.

920
00:56:48,801 --> 00:56:49,906
TRAVIS: I nock an arrow.

921
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:52,447
MATT: Roll an attack.

922
00:56:52,447 --> 00:56:56,737
TRAVIS: Oh shit. 25.

923
00:56:56,737 --> 00:56:58,882
MATT: Roll damage with sneak attack.

924
00:56:58,882 --> 00:57:02,762
(laughter)

925
00:57:02,762 --> 00:57:04,356
LAURA: We're so terrible!

926
00:57:04,356 --> 00:57:10,955
TRAVIS: That's terrible! Eight. Nine. 13.

927
00:57:10,955 --> 00:57:13,292
MATT: As you're holding him.

928
00:57:13,292 --> 00:57:18,726
SAM: I trust you implicitly. We are in this
together 100%.

929
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:22,763
MATT: "Don't worry, we've got this! All right, we're
going to make our way inside."

930
00:57:22,763 --> 00:57:27,757
SAM: Friends. Oh no!

931
00:57:27,757 --> 00:57:30,669
TRAVIS: Heal him!

932
00:57:30,669 --> 00:57:39,620
SAM: I can! I will use my medical kit to stabilize
him! I pull out the arrow! No, don't do this to

933
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:50,489
me! Come on, fight! You can come back! I spit into
the wound, I close it with my hand.

934
00:57:50,489 --> 00:57:55,389
MATT: I'm going to ask you right now to make an
initiative roll to see how fast you are at healing

935
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:58,281
him versus how fast he's bleeding out from the
wound.

936
00:57:58,281 --> 00:57:59,535
SAM: Nine.

937
00:57:59,535 --> 00:58:13,607
MATT: You finish applying the bandages, you've
pulled out the bolt, and you have the body there.

938
00:58:13,607 --> 00:58:17,887
(cough) He rolled a three.

939
00:58:17,887 --> 00:58:19,987
SAM: Bock! Bock-Bock! What's his name?

940
00:58:19,987 --> 00:58:20,933
LAURA: Borg-Borg!

941
00:58:20,933 --> 00:58:21,881
SAM: Borg-Borg?

942
00:58:21,881 --> 00:58:23,117
MATT: "Just Borg."

943
00:58:23,117 --> 00:58:34,178
SAM: Borg, I thought I had lost you. I don't know
what happened. All I can say is: I'm sorry and it

944
00:58:34,178 --> 00:58:36,048
will never happen again.

945
00:58:36,048 --> 00:58:44,770
MATT: You guys approach as Eden is cradling this
freshly bandaged goblin.

946
00:58:44,770 --> 00:58:45,948
LAURA: Did we kill him?

947
00:58:45,948 --> 00:58:47,288
TRAVIS: Oh, you fixed him up?

948
00:58:47,288 --> 00:58:49,647
SAM: Why did you do that?! He's our ticket in!

949
00:58:49,647 --> 00:58:51,648
LAURA and TRAVIS: Oh!

950
00:58:51,648 --> 00:58:56,639
SAM: I think you can still trust us, all right?

951
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:58,164
MATT: "Okay."

952
00:58:58,164 --> 00:59:03,567
TRAVIS: Or you can take that as a sign of things
to come if you do it again!

953
00:59:03,567 --> 00:59:05,601
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

954
00:59:05,601 --> 00:59:09,948
TRAVIS: Prepare to feel the-- oh, not terrible!
20!

955
00:59:09,948 --> 00:59:16,460
MATT: He goes, "Right. Point making. I'm good. All
right."

956
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:27,110
TRAVIS: Boy, don't you call me point making! All
right. Inside. Wait. Should we make him look a

957
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:29,468
little better? You almost killed him.

958
00:59:29,468 --> 00:59:32,950
LAURA: Does anybody have any lipstick? And some
rouge?

959
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:34,920
TRAVIS: What?

960
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:37,521
LAURA: I thought we were going to make him
pretty.

961
00:59:37,521 --> 00:59:38,917
SAM: I have a robe.

962
00:59:38,917 --> 00:59:44,559
DARIN: I have oil. In certain cases, I'm just
saying.

963
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:46,071
LAURA: I have some bagpipes.

964
00:59:46,071 --> 00:59:47,196
TRAVIS: I have a crowbar.

965
00:59:47,196 --> 00:59:48,342
SAM: You have a bagpipe?

966
00:59:48,342 --> 00:59:52,333
LAURA: I like to play music sometimes, that's
all.

967
00:59:52,333 --> 00:59:56,181
SAM: I think we're good, let's just get on with
it.

968
00:59:56,181 --> 01:00:04,121
MATT: All right. So as you guys slowly begin to
encroach upon the outer elements of this fortress,

969
01:00:04,121 --> 01:00:10,860
the points of torchlight burning in these braziers
along the top side of it, you can see guards

970
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:16,631
walking back and forth along the edges, shortbows
at the side, nocked and ready in case any sign of

971
01:00:16,631 --> 01:00:22,961
danger happens. You can see a front-- actually,
for you guys that are closest, go ahead and make a

972
01:00:22,961 --> 01:00:25,102
perception check.

973
01:00:25,102 --> 01:00:28,112
TRAVIS: Yeah! 17.

974
01:00:28,112 --> 01:00:29,442
MATT: All righty.

975
01:00:29,442 --> 01:00:30,401
SAM: Nothing.

976
01:00:30,401 --> 01:00:31,441
LAURA: Five.

977
01:00:31,441 --> 01:00:33,502
DARIN: Nine.

978
01:00:33,502 --> 01:00:39,071
MATT: Okay. So as you all stare off and it's about
as much as you can make out. You, however, Skak,

979
01:00:39,071 --> 01:00:43,891
looking ahead, you can see: one, there's a main
entrance. There's two large, eight-foot-wide doors

980
01:00:43,891 --> 01:00:51,986
that are currently closed on the north side of the
wall. You also see what happens to be a

981
01:00:51,986 --> 01:00:58,924
muck-covered mud hole that's towards the south
side, where the wall meets the mountain, where you

982
01:00:58,924 --> 01:01:05,172
can see it's a little swampy and it looks like
some of this thick muck and mud meets up to the

983
01:01:05,172 --> 01:01:06,916
side of the wall there.

984
01:01:06,916 --> 01:01:15,325
TRAVIS: So the doors lie ahead but I see off to
the side a little quagmire.

985
01:01:15,325 --> 01:01:16,332
LAURA: What's that?

986
01:01:16,332 --> 01:01:20,109
TRAVIS: It's like mucky, muddier earth and
liquid--

987
01:01:20,109 --> 01:01:21,477
LAURA: Oh, we could take a bath!

988
01:01:21,477 --> 01:01:26,252
TRAVIS: We could, yes, or we could see if perhaps
there's a way under the wall.

989
01:01:26,252 --> 01:01:31,063
DARIN: Do you know what that is? Have you been
through there before?

990
01:01:31,063 --> 01:01:35,133
MATT: "Well, I've seen it, aye."

991
01:01:35,133 --> 01:01:37,216
DARIN: Have you ever seen anyone go in or out of
there?

992
01:01:37,216 --> 01:01:39,576
MATT: "Not intentionally. It's the shrak
hole."

993
01:01:39,613 --> 01:01:41,264
(groaning)

994
01:01:41,264 --> 01:01:42,698
LAURA: What's that?

995
01:01:42,698 --> 01:01:51,845
MATT: "I could show you." (coughs) Its wrapping is
all around the face and one eye-- it was already

996
01:01:51,845 --> 01:01:55,758
swollen from earlier and is now-- he's a
wrecked-looking goblin.

997
01:01:55,758 --> 01:01:57,356
LAURA: What happened to your neck?

998
01:01:57,356 --> 01:02:00,005
MATT: "I don't know."

999
01:02:00,005 --> 01:02:02,728
TRAVIS: So we either go in through the front
door--

1000
01:02:02,728 --> 01:02:04,545
SAM: Or the back door.

1001
01:02:04,545 --> 01:02:13,384
TRAVIS: (laughs) Oh yes, literally! Oh jeez! Oh
gosh.

1002
01:02:13,384 --> 01:02:16,699
SAM: I think we should go through the back door.

1003
01:02:16,699 --> 01:02:19,959
(laughter)

1004
01:02:19,959 --> 01:02:21,678
TRAVIS: (laughs) Okay.

1005
01:02:21,678 --> 01:02:23,484
SAM: Hey, shrak happens.

1006
01:02:23,484 --> 01:02:31,108
TRAVIS: Yeah, it does. Shrak yeah! Okay, do we
send him first? No, because if he gets in, he

1007
01:02:31,108 --> 01:02:34,248
runs away. I'm just saying.

1008
01:02:34,248 --> 01:02:36,224
SAM: Yeah, we'll go first. Right?

1009
01:02:36,224 --> 01:02:37,671
TRAVIS: Which one of us?

1010
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:43,156
DARIN: Who's the most beaten up? Who's been through
absolute hell?

1011
01:02:43,156 --> 01:02:44,419
SAM: You.

1012
01:02:44,419 --> 01:02:47,583
DARIN: There's two things I know. I'm going
first--

1013
01:02:47,583 --> 01:02:50,191
ALL: And that's it.

1014
01:02:50,191 --> 01:02:53,590
DARIN: I'm going first.

1015
01:02:53,590 --> 01:02:54,937
SAM: Go through that shrak hole!

1016
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:58,894
MATT: All right. So I want you guys to all make
stealth checks to make your way around that hole

1017
01:02:58,894 --> 01:03:00,336
without being seen.

1018
01:03:00,336 --> 01:03:01,905
SAM: We're stealthing?

1019
01:03:01,905 --> 01:03:05,117
MATT: Yes, and that's disadvantage for you, Arby,
unfortunately. Because you have heavy armor on.

1020
01:03:05,117 --> 01:03:07,646
LAURA: (high-pitched) Oh man! But I rolled so well
on that first one!

1021
01:03:07,646 --> 01:03:08,939
MATT: (high-pitched) Well, roll a second time!

1022
01:03:08,939 --> 01:03:10,275
DARIN: So the roll plus dexterity?

1023
01:03:10,275 --> 01:03:12,195
MATT: No, it's a stealth check.

1024
01:03:12,195 --> 01:03:13,308
DARIN: Oh, five.

1025
01:03:13,308 --> 01:03:14,630
TRAVIS: Five total?

1026
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:15,532
SAM: Nine.

1027
01:03:15,532 --> 01:03:16,576
DARIN: It was a one.

1028
01:03:16,576 --> 01:03:17,996
TRAVIS: 21.

1029
01:03:17,996 --> 01:03:19,386
LAURA: Ten.

1030
01:03:19,386 --> 01:03:25,617
MATT: Okay! As you guys quietly make your way over
to the shrak hole, you approach the base of the

1031
01:03:25,617 --> 01:03:32,585
gate there and you hear a voice above you go,
"Hey! What are you doing?"

1032
01:03:32,585 --> 01:03:34,088
SAM: Bonk! Say something!

1033
01:03:34,088 --> 01:03:39,916
MATT: You look up and there's three archers that
all have their bows notched on you, going, "What

1034
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:41,045
"the hell are you--"

1035
01:03:41,045 --> 01:03:42,444
SAM: Brick, say something!

1036
01:03:42,444 --> 01:03:52,392
MATT: "Oh. We're gathering for the alchemist. Getting
some more prime shrak for his boomy balls!

1037
01:03:52,392 --> 01:03:59,086
"Yeah!" He's going to attempt to make a deception--
oh, not bad, actually. Let's see if they-- rolling

1038
01:03:59,086 --> 01:04:07,265
against myself here. "All right. Who are them?"

1039
01:04:07,265 --> 01:04:10,757
LAURA: We're the Forcs!

1040
01:04:10,757 --> 01:04:14,852
MATT: "What's the Forcs?"

1041
01:04:14,852 --> 01:04:17,096
LAURA: It's what you eat with!

1042
01:04:17,096 --> 01:04:19,138
SAM: We work for Ur-Gram!

1043
01:04:19,138 --> 01:04:23,207
MATT: Make a deception check.

1044
01:04:23,207 --> 01:04:26,715
SAM: Oh no. Five.

1045
01:04:26,715 --> 01:04:34,727
MATT: One of them starts whispering to the other
one and the one that he's whispering to nods and

1046
01:04:34,727 --> 01:04:40,723
goes and grabs one of the torches and starts going
over towards one of the unlit braziers. You've

1047
01:04:40,723 --> 01:04:46,656
seen these before; they're used usually as a
beacon, a warning, a signal for any sort of undue--

1048
01:04:46,656 --> 01:04:49,735
SAM: Let's go through the shrak hole right away!
Fast, charging in!

1049
01:04:49,735 --> 01:04:51,243
LAURA: You kill him.

1050
01:04:51,243 --> 01:04:55,345
TRAVIS: The guy walking towards the brazier? Yeah,
but there are three longbows above us and we have

1051
01:04:55,345 --> 01:04:56,504
the low ground.

1052
01:04:56,504 --> 01:04:58,972
SAM: That's why we have to go through the shrak
hole, as fast as we can!

1053
01:04:58,972 --> 01:05:01,377
LAURA: Kill him so he doesn't light it, then we go
into the poop.

1054
01:05:01,377 --> 01:05:07,046
TRAVIS: Okay. I eye the guy walking with the torch
towards the brazier. Does he look like he intends

1055
01:05:07,046 --> 01:05:08,635
to light said brazier?

1056
01:05:08,635 --> 01:05:09,843
MATT: He looks like he intends to light it.

1057
01:05:09,843 --> 01:05:13,999
TRAVIS: I will draw very quickly the crossbow and
try and put one in while he's not looking.

1058
01:05:13,999 --> 01:05:15,544
MATT: Go ahead and roll for an attack.

1059
01:05:15,544 --> 01:05:17,024
TRAVIS: Rolling with sneak attack.

1060
01:05:17,024 --> 01:05:19,353
SAM: How high is the wall, Matt?

1061
01:05:19,353 --> 01:05:20,493
LAURA: Is it a surprise attack?

1062
01:05:20,493 --> 01:05:24,566
MATT: No, it is not a surprise attack. It's
probably about 15 feet high.

1063
01:05:24,566 --> 01:05:26,217
TRAVIS: But is it a sneak attack?

1064
01:05:26,217 --> 01:05:31,294
MATT: You weren't-- oh, you were pretty stealthed,
the rest weren't. So yeah, it is now a sneak

1065
01:05:31,294 --> 01:05:32,304
attack.

1066
01:05:32,304 --> 01:05:33,503
TRAVIS: 16 to hit.

1067
01:05:33,503 --> 01:05:36,273
MATT: 16 to hit. Yeah, that hits! The archer.

1068
01:05:36,273 --> 01:05:45,248
TRAVIS: Okay. Ten, 15, 16, 17.

1069
01:05:45,248 --> 01:05:50,654
MATT: All right, so the one that's walking towards
the brazier falls off the wall on the side and

1070
01:05:50,654 --> 01:05:54,154
slams into the mud there. And the other two
archers immediately go--

1071
01:05:54,154 --> 01:05:55,742
TRAVIS: (shouting) Go!

1072
01:05:55,742 --> 01:05:59,293
MATT: And they both pull and they're going to both
fire arrows down. One of them is going to fire at

1073
01:05:59,293 --> 01:06:04,095
you-- actually they're both going to fire at you
because you killed their friend. You revealed

1074
01:06:04,095 --> 01:06:05,873
yourself. They suck though-- that's an 11.

1075
01:06:05,873 --> 01:06:07,063
TRAVIS: That will miss!

1076
01:06:07,063 --> 01:06:08,814
MATT: Yeah. And a ten.

1077
01:06:08,814 --> 01:06:10,780
TRAVIS: That misses as well!

1078
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:15,392
MATT: So you duck out on both sides and they both
go for secondary arrows and begin running towards

1079
01:06:15,392 --> 01:06:17,243
the brazier themselves now. What are you guys
doing?

1080
01:06:17,243 --> 01:06:19,854
LAURA: Oh no! You should hit them too because
they're going to light it.

1081
01:06:19,854 --> 01:06:21,933
SAM: I'm going to jump up onto the wall.

1082
01:06:21,933 --> 01:06:23,434
LAURA: Can you do that?

1083
01:06:23,434 --> 01:06:31,271
SAM: I'm going to use my step of the wind which
doubles my jump distance. Distance, does that mean

1084
01:06:31,271 --> 01:06:32,244
height?

1085
01:06:32,244 --> 01:06:36,141
MATT: Well, yeah. But horizontal distance-- we'll
say height for this. What's your strength

1086
01:06:36,141 --> 01:06:37,304
modifier?

1087
01:06:37,304 --> 01:06:42,146
SAM: Four-- one. My strength modifier is one.

1088
01:06:42,146 --> 01:06:50,317
MATT: Right. It doubles it, so you get (grunts).
I'll say you barely-- because of your height.

1089
01:06:50,317 --> 01:06:55,331
Because you are an olog, you barely get your
fingers up on the top. Go ahead and make a

1090
01:06:55,331 --> 01:06:57,184
strength saving throw to try and pull yourself up.

1091
01:06:57,184 --> 01:07:00,925
SAM: Okay. (scoffs) Nine.

1092
01:07:00,925 --> 01:07:06,675
MATT: You drop back down. It's just too high.

1093
01:07:06,675 --> 01:07:09,876
LAURA: Are there any rocks around?

1094
01:07:09,876 --> 01:07:12,575
MATT: Make an investigation check if you want to.

1095
01:07:12,575 --> 01:07:16,305
DARIN: We did take a rest. Did we regain any spells
we use?

1096
01:07:16,305 --> 01:07:19,744
MATT: No. It's a long rest.

1097
01:07:19,744 --> 01:07:20,673
LAURA: 12.

1098
01:07:20,673 --> 01:07:24,105
MATT: A 12? You find a small rock. In your hand,
it's really small.

1099
01:07:24,105 --> 01:07:27,867
LAURA: I'm going to try to throw this little rock
at one of them.

1100
01:07:27,867 --> 01:07:29,828
MATT: Make an attack roll. (laughs)

1101
01:07:29,828 --> 01:07:32,565
LAURA: 11!

1102
01:07:32,565 --> 01:07:35,881
MATT: It arcs over the wall.

1103
01:07:35,881 --> 01:07:40,212
LAURA: I'm used to bigger-sized rocks, is all. Just
because they were so--

1104
01:07:40,212 --> 01:07:42,083
SAM: To the shrak hole!

1105
01:07:42,083 --> 01:07:43,851
LAURA: Wait, you have it. Try to hit it.

1106
01:07:43,851 --> 01:07:45,856
TRAVIS: I'm going to try and hit him, one of the
last two.

1107
01:07:45,856 --> 01:07:48,044
MATT: All right, go for it and they're going to go
again.

1108
01:07:48,044 --> 01:07:50,398
TRAVIS: Okay. 15.

1109
01:07:50,398 --> 01:07:51,940
MATT: 15 just barely hits!

1110
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:56,208
LAURA: We've got to get them before they light the
brazier!

1111
01:07:56,208 --> 01:07:58,521
SAM: It'll be okay.

1112
01:07:58,521 --> 01:08:01,385
MATT: It's technically not sneak attack because
you've already hit them.

1113
01:08:01,385 --> 01:08:03,132
TRAVIS: Oh, thank you. Then that is only-- it's
only ten.

1114
01:08:03,132 --> 01:08:09,509
MATT: Ten damage. Okay, so one of them gets hit
and he's still standing and he's going to whip

1115
01:08:09,509 --> 01:08:13,113
around and try to fire back at you. The other one
that's running past is going to go ahead and pull

1116
01:08:13,113 --> 01:08:20,031
out a torch and try to light it. All right, so
that ends your turn. They're going to go. One is

1117
01:08:20,031 --> 01:08:24,423
going to take another shot at you. There we go!
That is a 24 to hit.

1118
01:08:24,423 --> 01:08:26,902
DARIN: Do we all get-- I did not make an action.

1119
01:08:26,902 --> 01:08:28,274
MATT: Oh shit! That's right, you didn't. So you
go.

1120
01:08:28,274 --> 01:08:29,343
DARIN: Shrak hole.

1121
01:08:29,343 --> 01:08:30,445
SAM: Shrak hole.

1122
01:08:30,445 --> 01:08:31,113
LAURA: You go in?

1123
01:08:31,113 --> 01:08:32,242
DARIN: Yes, I'm going in.

1124
01:08:32,242 --> 01:08:42,023
MATT: Okay. So you go ahead and make a-- as you
dive into it, make an investigation check to try

1125
01:08:42,023 --> 01:08:43,523
and feel your way through.

1126
01:08:43,523 --> 01:08:44,888
LAURA: Eww!

1127
01:08:44,888 --> 01:08:47,193
DARIN: Seven.

1128
01:08:47,193 --> 01:08:53,864
MATT: You disappear into it and writhe around a
bunch to try and reach out for something. It's

1129
01:08:53,864 --> 01:08:58,334
very taut. Even your uruk form is having a hard
time pulling underneath.

1130
01:08:58,334 --> 01:09:00,927
DARIN: Again I feel alive.

1131
01:09:00,927 --> 01:09:03,354
MATT: Indeed. (laughs) All right, so you--

1132
01:09:03,354 --> 01:09:06,193
TRAVIS: Uncanny dodge, please.

1133
01:09:06,193 --> 01:09:12,393
MATT: Yes. That would be seven points of piercing
damage, reduced to three and the other guy manages

1134
01:09:12,393 --> 01:09:18,555
to light the brazier. The light goes bright. The
signal has been lit. What are you guys doing?

1135
01:09:18,555 --> 01:09:24,824
TRAVIS: We should run to the front door and act
like we saw attackers running off in a different

1136
01:09:24,824 --> 01:09:26,150
direction.

1137
01:09:26,150 --> 01:09:27,345
LAURA: That's really smart.

1138
01:09:27,345 --> 01:09:34,717
SAM: Split the party? He's in shrak right now. I'm
going to go in the shrak hole.

1139
01:09:34,717 --> 01:09:43,471
LAURA: I'm going to pick up the body of the guy
that fell and try to throw him at the other guy.

1140
01:09:43,471 --> 01:09:46,787
MATT: Make an attack roll!

1141
01:09:46,787 --> 01:09:49,084
LAURA: Yeah? I'm big.

1142
01:09:49,084 --> 01:09:51,774
MATT: This is just your strength modifier. You're
not proficient in bodies.

1143
01:09:51,774 --> 01:09:55,229
TRAVIS: (laughs) Body chucking's not a thing?

1144
01:09:55,229 --> 01:09:56,235
LAURA: Eight.

1145
01:09:56,235 --> 01:10:02,838
MATT: Eight? (laughs) You slam it against the
wall. It slides down and hits the ground. You hear

1146
01:10:02,838 --> 01:10:06,143
this horrible crunching sound as a number of
previously unbroken bones are now freshly broken

1147
01:10:06,143 --> 01:10:09,811
in the dead body. You have another attack if you
want to walk up and try it again.

1148
01:10:09,811 --> 01:10:12,524
LAURA: I want to try it again but this time, since
I didn't throw him high enough, I'm going to spin

1149
01:10:12,524 --> 01:10:14,815
around and try to lob him up. Yeah.

1150
01:10:14,815 --> 01:10:17,185
MATT: Okay. Make another attack roll with a
crumpled body.

1151
01:10:17,185 --> 01:10:21,185
LAURA: (laughs) That's terrible! Seven!

1152
01:10:21,185 --> 01:10:26,851
MATT: You release a little too early and it (heavy
impact) hits the wall right next to you. One of

1153
01:10:26,851 --> 01:10:32,045
the arms tears and flies off against the mud. You
liquefied his insides at this point.

1154
01:10:32,045 --> 01:10:34,297
LAURA: He's not feeling very good.

1155
01:10:34,297 --> 01:10:35,503
TRAVIS: Are we going into the shrak hole?

1156
01:10:35,503 --> 01:10:36,583
SAM: I'm going into the shrak hole!

1157
01:10:36,583 --> 01:10:38,487
LAURA: How big is the shrak hole? Can all of us
fit in there?

1158
01:10:38,487 --> 01:10:44,561
MATT: Well, as you dive in, it pushes you out the
other side. You get shoved out, plopped out,

1159
01:10:44,561 --> 01:10:50,774
covered in shrak. And you look around, immediately
you can see, as you wipe your eyes off the

1160
01:10:50,774 --> 01:10:55,386
shrak, everybody is now starting to look around at
the signal and begin to grab their weapons and

1161
01:10:55,386 --> 01:11:00,534
start preparing for an incursion. You dive into
it. You get halfway in-- this is a very small

1162
01:11:00,534 --> 01:11:05,558
space underneath and you're a very large olog. I'm
going to need you to make either an athletics

1163
01:11:05,558 --> 01:11:08,785
check or an acrobatics check to try and push
through. Your choice.

1164
01:11:08,785 --> 01:11:10,955
SAM: Acrobatics. 19.

1165
01:11:10,955 --> 01:11:16,285
MATT: 19. You push through and watch as the bottom
of the wall splinters and breaks, but you manage

1166
01:11:16,285 --> 01:11:22,607
to make your way through and now, you stand up
behind Mozuu, a good number of feet taller than

1167
01:11:22,607 --> 01:11:27,422
him, also covered in shrak and you both now look
around at this chaos happening. What are you

1168
01:11:27,422 --> 01:11:28,375
doing?

1169
01:11:28,375 --> 01:11:30,065
LAURA: Well, go in, Skak.

1170
01:11:30,065 --> 01:11:37,299
TRAVIS: No. Yes, and I jump in. I jump in after
him, in the shrak hole.

1171
01:11:37,299 --> 01:11:42,436
MATT: All right. You dive in. The space has been
opened, thankfully. You follow through. They paved

1172
01:11:42,436 --> 01:11:43,355
the path.

1173
01:11:43,355 --> 01:11:45,886
TRAVIS: Oh, I could barely make it through! So
big.

1174
01:11:45,886 --> 01:11:57,496
MATT: You glide through and now it's just you and
your friend, Borg, who's looking at the archers.

1175
01:11:57,587 --> 01:12:01,972
Well, the archers, the one that's with the torch
is going to go ahead and try and take another

1176
01:12:01,972 --> 01:12:05,837
shot. They're both taking a shot. One's going to
be at you and one's going to be at you, now that

1177
01:12:05,837 --> 01:12:08,426
you guys are on that side. Against you, that is a
21.

1178
01:12:08,426 --> 01:12:09,306
TRAVIS: Hits.

1179
01:12:09,306 --> 01:12:12,128
MATT: You take-- ooh, nine points of piercing
damage.

1180
01:12:12,128 --> 01:12:14,332
TRAVIS: Uncanny dodge. No, I already used my
reaction.

1181
01:12:14,332 --> 01:12:18,964
MATT: Well, you used it from last time, so it
returns. So you have it back again. You can use

1182
01:12:18,964 --> 01:12:25,907
it-- yeah. okay, it's reduced to four points of
piercing damage. And then one against you is a

1183
01:12:25,907 --> 01:12:27,676
14.

1184
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:28,742
LAURA: Doesn't hit me.

1185
01:12:28,742 --> 01:12:35,147
MATT: It breaks off the armor. They're both firing
arrows down at you. All right, so what are you

1186
01:12:35,147 --> 01:12:40,997
guys doing? You glide underneath as they fire at
you. You slip under. You're back there with Borg.

1187
01:12:40,997 --> 01:12:45,527
LAURA: I'm telling Borg to go through before me.
Go on.

1188
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:53,450
MATT: Dives in, like slowly wades into it (groans)
and goes under and pushes his way through without

1189
01:12:53,450 --> 01:12:54,497
an issue.

1190
01:12:54,497 --> 01:13:01,276
LAURA: All right. I'm going to gingerly lower
myself into the shrak and then go under slowly.

1191
01:13:01,276 --> 01:13:09,744
MATT: Okay. As you guys get up on the other side,
you can now see about 40 to 50 various uruk have

1192
01:13:09,744 --> 01:13:16,069
now gathered at the base of the wall where you're
standing. They're all armored and ready, their

1193
01:13:16,069 --> 01:13:20,227
weapons are drawn and you are completely
surrounded on the interior of this wall. Nothing

1194
01:13:20,227 --> 01:13:27,412
but liquid shrak at your back, as you all stand
there but they're all keeping at bay. You watch as

1195
01:13:27,412 --> 01:13:35,282
a hand comes up behind the crowd and goes,
"Hold!" Everyone was like-- they are ready to tear

1196
01:13:35,282 --> 01:13:45,067
at you but they begin to part at the center and
you watch with heavy steps as an olog-hai

1197
01:13:45,067 --> 01:13:51,931
approaches with a giant, mutated underbite with
tusks that reach up past the nostril. The eyes

1198
01:13:51,931 --> 01:13:58,337
peek through from heavily scarred muscle tissue
where a face once existed, but has since been torn

1199
01:13:58,337 --> 01:14:05,606
and not healed very well over. You see, clutching
a giant greataxe in its grasp, what you assume to

1200
01:14:05,606 --> 01:14:15,928
be Ur-Gram the Face-Eater, who's approached and goes,
"Who? Who enters <i>my</i> home?"

1201
01:14:15,928 --> 01:14:19,129
DARIN: The Bright Lord called to us.

1202
01:14:19,129 --> 01:14:22,951
MATT: Make a deception check.

1203
01:14:22,951 --> 01:14:28,372
DARIN: 15.

1204
01:14:28,372 --> 01:14:36,018
MATT: "The Bright Lord, you say?"

1205
01:14:36,018 --> 01:14:37,770
DARIN: Yes.

1206
01:14:37,770 --> 01:14:45,410
MATT: "Then stand at me! Walk up and prove you
bear the mark!"

1207
01:14:45,410 --> 01:14:52,709
DARIN: I bear no mark yet. I desire to.
I've literally gone through shrak for this moment.

1208
01:14:52,709 --> 01:15:02,676
The Bright Lord spoke to me in my head. He told
me, the strong take what they want. And I want to

1209
01:15:02,676 --> 01:15:04,837
be part of the Bright Lord's army.

1210
01:15:04,837 --> 01:15:14,397
MATT: At this point, you see Ur-Gram is taken
aback by this response and glances over his

1211
01:15:14,397 --> 01:15:22,818
shoulders. He steps back and you hear a voice from
behind him go, "Let me see this orc. Bring him

1212
01:15:22,818 --> 01:15:29,816
"before me." And as Ur-Gram steps aside, you see a
human male standing with long, somewhat-tattered

1213
01:15:29,816 --> 01:15:36,918
dark hair, beard towards the base of the chin,
wearing leather and hide armor and bits of

1214
01:15:36,918 --> 01:15:46,999
chainmail beneath a dark cloak with a single long
blade extended to one side. All the rest of the

1215
01:15:46,999 --> 01:15:52,500
various uruks around the area separate and back
away. As they do, you see a familiar flash in

1216
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:58,590
their eyes, that strange gray-white light that you
saw when you first had your fortress attacked. The

1217
01:15:58,590 --> 01:16:07,005
human man walks forward. "You say you came this
far for the Bright Lord. Then come. Stand before

1218
01:16:07,005 --> 01:16:10,665
"me. Be marked as you say your request."

1219
01:16:10,665 --> 01:16:12,440
LAURA: (whispering) Mozuu! Mozuu!

1220
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:13,978
SAM: (whispering) He's been chosen.

1221
01:16:13,978 --> 01:16:23,769
DARIN: I walk towards the Bright Lord. I kneel
before the Bright Lord. I am Mozuu the Chosen.

1222
01:16:23,769 --> 01:16:25,811
Choose me, Bright Lord.

1223
01:16:25,811 --> 01:16:33,832
MATT: As he looks down upon this snivelling uruk,
his hand protrudes forward and you see for a

1224
01:16:33,832 --> 01:16:39,715
second, the outer image of his form begin to
shimmer and for a moment, you see a familiar sight

1225
01:16:39,715 --> 01:16:45,738
you've only seen towards the outskirts of the dead
waste and swamps on the western side of Mordor.

1226
01:16:45,738 --> 01:16:50,939
You see spiritual energy pull out of him and you
see for a brief instant, a wraith-like form of

1227
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:56,830
some long-dead elf that marks the exterior of his
body. As the hand reaches forward, this voice

1228
01:16:56,830 --> 01:17:04,882
echoes around. "Come. May you join the rest of
this army." Takes the hand and places it against

1229
01:17:04,882 --> 01:17:06,700
the side of Mozuu's face.

1230
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:11,620
LAURA: I scream out, No! And run forward and try
to tackle him. Manswine!

1231
01:17:11,620 --> 01:17:15,611
(laughter)

1232
01:17:15,611 --> 01:17:18,032
MATT: I need you all to roll initiative right
now.

1233
01:17:18,032 --> 01:17:23,378
TRAVIS: Oh crap, oh crap, oh crap!

1234
01:17:23,378 --> 01:17:27,388
DARIN: That's really something!

1235
01:17:27,425 --> 01:17:28,930
LAURA: Oh shrak, oh shrak, oh shrak!

1236
01:17:28,930 --> 01:17:30,337
DARIN: So much for that idea.

1237
01:17:30,337 --> 01:17:35,739
MATT: Okay. You rolled a 12 initiative?

1238
01:17:35,739 --> 01:17:36,970
DARIN: Yeah.

1239
01:17:36,970 --> 01:17:38,251
MATT: All right. So we have--

1240
01:17:38,251 --> 01:17:41,818
SAM: Nine here.

1241
01:17:41,818 --> 01:17:43,490
MATT: All righty.

1242
01:17:43,490 --> 01:17:44,998
LAURA: 18.

1243
01:17:44,998 --> 01:17:51,336
MATT: Oh wow. You are dead even with the tark.

1244
01:17:51,336 --> 01:17:53,429
TRAVIS: 16 for me.

1245
01:17:53,429 --> 01:18:05,717
MATT: Okay. All right, so top of the round. Arby.
As you go charging forward right as the hand

1246
01:18:05,717 --> 01:18:09,419
reaches to grab the side of Mozuu's face, what are
you going to do?

1247
01:18:09,419 --> 01:18:11,290
LAURA: I'm going to--

1248
01:18:11,290 --> 01:18:13,224
MATT: Make a shove attack or try and push him out
of the way?

1249
01:18:13,224 --> 01:18:15,189
LAURA: I was trying to push him off of Mozuu.

1250
01:18:15,189 --> 01:18:20,060
MATT: Okay then. Making a shove attack for your
first strike. I believe I need you to make an

1251
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:26,371
athletics check. I'm checking here. It doesn't
happen <i>too</i> often.

1252
01:18:26,371 --> 01:18:27,771
LAURA: 20!

1253
01:18:27,771 --> 01:18:39,329
MATT: 20. Okay. Yep, contested against athletics
or acrobatics. All righty. Weirdly enough, you

1254
01:18:39,329 --> 01:18:45,200
manage to get in fast enough. Your large olog-hai
form (heavy footsteps) and slam with your shoulder

1255
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:50,140
into this tark. He goes flying off, spinning in the
air and landing, barely catching himself as he

1256
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:55,890
skids back about ten feet or so. Looks up at you
and still the wraith form is on the outside. The

1257
01:18:55,890 --> 01:19:01,630
eyes flash with this vibrant scary white light and
the wraith form fits back into the body. As the

1258
01:19:01,630 --> 01:19:08,504
tark stands to his feet, the blade at his side and
goes, "Very well. So you've chosen death."

1259
01:19:08,504 --> 01:19:10,620
LAURA: (shouting) Death!

1260
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:12,275
(laughter)

1261
01:19:12,275 --> 01:19:15,460
MATT: All right. So you still have another attack
if you want to take it.

1262
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:23,566
LAURA: Okay! I want to keep attacking him! I don't
know which dice to use though. Okay! 26!

1263
01:19:23,566 --> 01:19:25,622
MATT: 26 hits!

1264
01:19:25,622 --> 01:19:32,499
LAURA: (shouting) Man-filth! 14!

1265
01:19:32,499 --> 01:19:41,963
MATT: (laughs) 14 points of damage. Nice! All
right. So as you hit him, you hear a ringing out

1266
01:19:41,963 --> 01:19:49,389
behind him, the voice of the Face-Eater himself,
Ur-Gram says, "Gravewalker! Smash the invaders!"

1267
01:19:49,389 --> 01:19:53,220
TRAVIS: Oh jeez.

1268
01:19:53,220 --> 01:19:54,631
LAURA: We're all going to die!

1269
01:19:54,631 --> 01:19:56,477
(laughter)

1270
01:19:56,477 --> 01:19:58,533
TRAVIS: There's only 40 of them. 40 or 50.

1271
01:19:58,533 --> 01:20:04,292
MATT: All right. So at this point, the gravewalker, 
who's now up in front of you, takes the hit and

1272
01:20:04,292 --> 01:20:11,753
glares back at you with the burning white eyes.
He's going to go ahead and make two strikes on you

1273
01:20:11,753 --> 01:20:16,052
with Urfael, his sword. That is a 21.

1274
01:20:16,052 --> 01:20:17,459
LAURA: That hits me.

1275
01:20:17,459 --> 01:20:26,490
MATT: And that is seven points of slashing damage.
And 19.

1276
01:20:26,490 --> 01:20:28,232
LAURA: Ugh. That also hits.

1277
01:20:28,232 --> 01:20:34,533
MATT: That is six points of slashing damage and
then he is going to go ahead and attempt a shadow

1278
01:20:34,533 --> 01:20:41,582
strike attack. As it strikes you twice with the
sword, sidesteps to the side and looks around at

1279
01:20:41,582 --> 01:20:48,576
you and that is a 16. What's your armor class?

1280
01:20:48,576 --> 01:20:49,587
TRAVIS: 16!

1281
01:20:49,587 --> 01:20:55,025
MATT: 16! It hits you! As you watch the
gravewalker suddenly vanishes from his place, a

1282
01:20:55,025 --> 01:21:00,102
streak of vibrant white light shoots between the
two of you and appears right in front of you,

1283
01:21:00,102 --> 01:21:06,410
before striking down. That's an 18 to hit?

1284
01:21:06,410 --> 01:21:08,121
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yeah, it hits!

1285
01:21:08,121 --> 01:21:14,312
MATT: All right. You suffer five points of-- I'm
sorry, nine points of slashing damage and four

1286
01:21:14,312 --> 01:21:15,973
points of radiant damage.

1287
01:21:15,973 --> 01:21:19,021
TRAVIS: Whoa, so can I use uncanny dodge on the
slashing but not the radiant?

1288
01:21:19,021 --> 01:21:20,642
MATT: Well, it's against the whole attack.

1289
01:21:20,642 --> 01:21:24,212
TRAVIS: So 13 points down to seven?

1290
01:21:24,212 --> 01:21:29,198
MATT: Correct. Down to six, it would be. All
right. And that's going to end the gravewalker's

1291
01:21:29,198 --> 01:21:31,988
turn. All right. Ending that, Skak, you're up.

1292
01:21:31,988 --> 01:21:41,138
TRAVIS: (shrieks) Please! Let us live! Let us
live! I want to be with you! And I will aim my

1293
01:21:41,138 --> 01:21:43,757
crossbow over at Eden.

1294
01:21:43,757 --> 01:21:45,575
(laughter)

1295
01:21:45,575 --> 01:21:51,378
TRAVIS: And I'll pull the trigger.

1296
01:21:51,378 --> 01:21:55,986
MATT: (laughs) Okay! Roll. Go for it.

1297
01:21:55,986 --> 01:22:01,486
TRAVIS: Is he within melee of one of my 40 or 50
of my new allies?

1298
01:22:01,486 --> 01:22:05,525
MATT: No. What was once an ally is now no
longer--

1299
01:22:05,525 --> 01:22:07,097
TRAVIS: 23.

1300
01:22:07,097 --> 01:22:10,362
SAM: That hits, but I'll use deflect missiles.

1301
01:22:10,362 --> 01:22:12,856
MATT: Roll for damage.

1302
01:22:12,856 --> 01:22:16,616
TRAVIS: (laughs) Ah, shit! Seven.

1303
01:22:16,616 --> 01:22:22,285
SAM: I reduce that by more than seven points.

1304
01:22:22,285 --> 01:22:25,357
MATT: So as you fire the crossbow bolt, you watch
as Eden--

1305
01:22:25,357 --> 01:22:29,530
SAM: (catches bolt) (bolt whooshes)

1306
01:22:29,530 --> 01:22:30,646
TRAVIS: Oh!

1307
01:22:30,646 --> 01:22:32,872
(laughter)

1308
01:22:32,872 --> 01:22:35,746
MATT: So you spend a ki point and go ahead and
roll an attack with it. It's considered

1309
01:22:35,746 --> 01:22:36,589
proficient.

1310
01:22:36,589 --> 01:22:37,859
LAURA: Oh my god. You get to attack him?

1311
01:22:37,859 --> 01:22:40,605
MATT: Yeah. If you reduce the damage past what it
did, you get to throw it back at him.

1312
01:22:40,605 --> 01:22:41,895
LAURA: That's awesome!

1313
01:22:41,895 --> 01:22:45,209
SAM: 16. I rolled a 16 plus I don't
know.

1314
01:22:45,209 --> 01:22:50,267
MATT: Yeah, that hits! So go and roll damage. So
it's a d8 plus your dexterity.

1315
01:22:50,267 --> 01:22:52,284
SAM: Oh. My dexterity is plus four.

1316
01:22:52,284 --> 01:22:53,778
MATT: Yeah. So d8 plus four.

1317
01:22:53,778 --> 01:22:56,484
TRAVIS: (scared voice) Play along! Tell a joke!

1318
01:22:56,484 --> 01:22:58,835
SAM: Eight plus four.

1319
01:22:58,835 --> 01:23:00,423
MATT: 12 points of piercing damage.

1320
01:23:00,423 --> 01:23:02,596
TRAVIS: I can't use uncanny dodge--

1321
01:23:02,596 --> 01:23:04,808
MATT: No, you already used it! (laughs)

1322
01:23:04,808 --> 01:23:10,256
LAURA: What are you at right now?

1323
01:23:10,256 --> 01:23:11,499
TRAVIS: Eight.

1324
01:23:11,499 --> 01:23:15,687
MATT: Good to know. All right, at the end of your
turn-- you still have a bonus action if you want

1325
01:23:15,687 --> 01:23:17,050
to try something.

1326
01:23:17,050 --> 01:23:19,826
TRAVIS: I want to hide behind the gravewalker's
legs!

1327
01:23:19,826 --> 01:23:21,437
(laughter)

1328
01:23:21,437 --> 01:23:27,818
MATT: Okay! So you move behind the gravewalker?
All right, at the end of your turn, he's going to

1329
01:23:27,818 --> 01:23:34,027
use two of his legendary actions to try a dominate
on you.

1330
01:23:34,027 --> 01:23:35,705
TRAVIS: Me?

1331
01:23:35,705 --> 01:23:37,418
MATT: Yes. So as you reach behind--

1332
01:23:37,418 --> 01:23:39,427
SAM: You've shown yourself to be weak.

1333
01:23:39,427 --> 01:23:40,731
(laughter)

1334
01:23:40,731 --> 01:23:42,596
TRAVIS: I was born this way.

1335
01:23:42,596 --> 01:23:48,857
MATT: It's an 18. So he reaches behind and as he's
still staring forward, grasps the side of your

1336
01:23:48,857 --> 01:23:52,510
face and you feel this burning, singeing
sensation. Make a wisdom saving throw.

1337
01:23:52,510 --> 01:23:57,170
TRAVIS: 13.

1338
01:23:57,170 --> 01:24:03,933
MATT: 13. The mark, the brand of the gravewalker
now burned into your face. You see the majesty of

1339
01:24:03,933 --> 01:24:08,788
the Bright Lord before you and you understand.
This is the one to follow.

1340
01:24:08,788 --> 01:24:10,650
TRAVIS: This is the one to follow.

1341
01:24:10,650 --> 01:24:14,789
MATT: So whereas you may have decided to change
allegiance before, it's solidified now. You are

1342
01:24:14,789 --> 01:24:17,630
working for the gravewalker.

1343
01:24:17,630 --> 01:24:19,410
TRAVIS: Yes! Bright Lord!

1344
01:24:19,410 --> 01:24:25,418
MATT: All right. That ends that turn. Mozuu,
you're up. The rest of the uruks are stepping back

1345
01:24:25,418 --> 01:24:28,320
and watching this. They're just enjoying the
fray.

1346
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:31,460
DARIN: I stand ready to be chosen.

1347
01:24:31,460 --> 01:24:40,535
MATT: (laughs) So you stay there and still
kneeling, 20 feet away? All righty. That's your

1348
01:24:40,535 --> 01:24:41,464
whole--

1349
01:24:41,464 --> 01:24:49,780
DARIN: There's two things I know. The Bright Lord
is my new master and I am merely Mozuu unless you

1350
01:24:49,780 --> 01:24:51,891
choose me.

1351
01:24:51,891 --> 01:24:59,746
MATT: (evil laughter) Perfect. All right, that
ends Mozuu's turn. Eden, you're up, having just

1352
01:24:59,746 --> 01:25:02,251
thrown the bolt back at Skak.

1353
01:25:02,251 --> 01:25:11,223
SAM: I look over at Arby, trying to get a sense of
what-- is she on my side?

1354
01:25:11,223 --> 01:25:13,026
(laughter)

1355
01:25:13,026 --> 01:25:20,015
LAURA: I got a lot of shrak falling off me right
now.

1356
01:25:20,015 --> 01:25:31,990
SAM: (sighs) This is not going to end well. Our
leader, Barfta, told us if we found where they

1357
01:25:31,990 --> 01:25:36,749
were, that would be a reward. I'm going to leave.

1358
01:25:36,749 --> 01:25:41,293
(laughter)

1359
01:25:41,293 --> 01:25:45,553
SAM: I can't win this fight!

1360
01:25:45,553 --> 01:25:47,361
MATT: All right. So--

1361
01:25:47,361 --> 01:25:49,028
TRAVIS: Not with <i>that</i> attitude!

1362
01:25:49,028 --> 01:25:51,920
SAM: Everyone's turning into bad guys!

1363
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:55,201
TRAVIS: Well, technically, we <i>are</i> bad guys.

1364
01:25:55,201 --> 01:26:04,302
SAM: That's right. Oh, I don't know what to do! I
can't beat that guy. He's a wraith! I'm going to--

1365
01:26:04,302 --> 01:26:06,351
MATT: You're going to run?

1366
01:26:06,351 --> 01:26:11,240
SAM: --spend my last ki point and run as fast as I
can through the shrak.

1367
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:22,715
MATT: You're like-- dive back into the shrak hole
underneath. It's easy enough for you to push past

1368
01:26:22,715 --> 01:26:28,757
now, since you made way earlier. You pop out on
the other side and start bolting away. All right.

1369
01:26:28,757 --> 01:26:34,052
At the end of your turn, the gravewalker's going
to go ahead and use his last legendary action--

1370
01:26:34,052 --> 01:26:41,349
seeing you dart away, he's going to turn back
towards you. He's going to go ahead and the blade

1371
01:26:41,349 --> 01:26:46,892
goes away for a second and pulls his bow, Azkar,
out and pulls back an arrow, releases it.

1372
01:26:46,892 --> 01:26:51,425
Actually, that's a 12! Rolled really low.

1373
01:26:51,425 --> 01:26:54,502
LAURA: I dodge it. It's all the shrak on me, it
slips off.

1374
01:26:54,502 --> 01:26:58,290
MATT: It slips off and you're unmoving.
Unbreakable, even.

1375
01:26:58,290 --> 01:26:59,524
LAURA: Unbreakable!

1376
01:26:59,524 --> 01:27:04,433
MATT: All right. Back to the top. It's now Arby
and the gravewalker's turn.

1377
01:27:04,433 --> 01:27:06,838
LAURA: I run over and I try to hit him!

1378
01:27:06,838 --> 01:27:10,808
MATT: All right, you rush, maul swinging in the
air. Go for it.

1379
01:27:10,808 --> 01:27:14,608
LAURA: Oh no! That's 11!

1380
01:27:14,608 --> 01:27:20,932
MATT: 11? You go and swing and you watch as the
form shimmies by and he dodges right out of the

1381
01:27:20,932 --> 01:27:22,881
way, preternaturally fast.

1382
01:27:22,881 --> 01:27:26,708
LAURA: You're tricky, you! I try to hit him
again!

1383
01:27:26,708 --> 01:27:28,187
MATT: Okay.

1384
01:27:28,187 --> 01:27:34,157
LAURA: Oh no! That's only 11, again!

1385
01:27:34,157 --> 01:27:39,497
MATT: (laughs) The second swing goes wide and for
a second, you're sure you made contact but in the

1386
01:27:39,497 --> 01:27:45,036
space where the hammer goes, you watch as the
gravewalker stands back into place. "You sow chaos

1387
01:27:45,036 --> 01:27:46,743
"and invite it."

1388
01:27:46,743 --> 01:27:49,765
LAURA: I don't even know what you mean.

1389
01:27:49,765 --> 01:27:58,198
MATT: "Bow or crumple before your Bright Lord. The
choice matters not, for death has already found me

1390
01:27:58,198 --> 01:28:04,650
"once and lost." And he's going to go ahead and
attempt a wraith stun attack against you. That is

1391
01:28:04,650 --> 01:28:06,301
23 to hit?

1392
01:28:06,301 --> 01:28:07,417
LAURA: Oh no!

1393
01:28:07,417 --> 01:28:14,441
MATT: All right. You take ten points of radiant
damage.

1394
01:28:14,441 --> 01:28:22,859
LAURA: I'm going to use my troll's endurance! And
I'm going to take that down by ten.

1395
01:28:22,859 --> 01:28:26,148
MATT: By ten? So it hits you and you resist the
damage but I still need you to make a constitution

1396
01:28:26,148 --> 01:28:27,187
saving throw.

1397
01:28:27,187 --> 01:28:32,422
LAURA: Oh no. 21!

1398
01:28:32,422 --> 01:28:38,977
MATT: Okay. You feel the impact, the wraith
energies, but your physical form, being a tough

1399
01:28:38,977 --> 01:28:45,104
olog-hai, you resist the stunning effect of the
strike and push through it. No stun on you

1400
01:28:45,104 --> 01:28:51,086
whatsoever. And then he's going to go ahead and
follow up with two more attacks with Urfael, as

1401
01:28:51,086 --> 01:28:56,379
the bow's been put by the side. He's going to
swing twice with the blade against you. That is a

1402
01:28:56,379 --> 01:29:04,602
15? It just slides off your armor. Second strike,
that's cocked. Natural one.

1403
01:29:04,602 --> 01:29:06,484
ALL: Yeah!

1404
01:29:06,484 --> 01:29:11,267
MATT: So he swings a second time and you actually
catch the blade in your hand. You feel it like

1405
01:29:11,267 --> 01:29:15,478
cutting into your grip a little bit, but you
tighten as you stare down at the gravewalker.

1406
01:29:15,478 --> 01:29:20,671
Unmoved at this threatening presence that's
looking up at you, like it's only an

1407
01:29:20,671 --> 01:29:21,798
inevitability.

1408
01:29:21,798 --> 01:29:23,816
LAURA: I'm a boss fight, pig-skin!

1409
01:29:23,816 --> 01:29:26,584
(laughter)

1410
01:29:26,584 --> 01:29:33,746
MATT: All right. So that's going to go ahead and
end their turn. Skak, you're up.

1411
01:29:33,746 --> 01:29:43,172
TRAVIS: I serve the Bright Master! Can I hold my
attack and ask for one of the large uruks or

1412
01:29:43,172 --> 01:29:49,194
uruk-hais to pick me up and throw me above the
wall so I can take a crossbow shot at fleeing

1413
01:29:49,194 --> 01:29:50,353
Eden?

1414
01:29:50,353 --> 01:29:56,434
MATT: Sure, you glance off to the side and one of
the ologs who's off to the side there, has chains

1415
01:29:56,434 --> 01:30:03,821
around the chest, you can see maybe it was more
of the physical-handy ologs as opposed to warrior.

1416
01:30:03,821 --> 01:30:07,214
Looks at you with a nod. Make a persuasion check.

1417
01:30:07,214 --> 01:30:13,849
TRAVIS: We all must serve, answer the call! Yeah,
that's going to be a 19.

1418
01:30:13,849 --> 01:30:22,758
MATT: 19! The olog picks you up and gives
you an alley-oop into the air. Yeah, easily

1419
01:30:22,758 --> 01:30:27,069
enough, you arc up. Make an acrobatics check to
try and land your feet on the wall.

1420
01:30:27,069 --> 01:30:29,580
TRAVIS: 21.

1421
01:30:29,580 --> 01:30:36,557
MATT: You land on the edge of the wall and you
glance up, just passing, you can see Eden darting

1422
01:30:36,557 --> 01:30:38,170
away.

1423
01:30:38,170 --> 01:30:39,638
TRAVIS: We cannot flee!

1424
01:30:39,638 --> 01:30:42,947
MATT: Make an attack!

1425
01:30:42,947 --> 01:30:48,810
TRAVIS: Does he know what's coming? Any chance of
sneak attack? He's on the other side of the wall.

1426
01:30:48,810 --> 01:30:51,978
MATT: I will say, he's not aware of your presence.
Sure, I'll allow it.

1427
01:30:51,978 --> 01:31:02,929
TRAVIS: Yeah! 15, 17, 18.

1428
01:31:02,929 --> 01:31:05,429
MATT: 18 points of piercing damage.

1429
01:31:05,429 --> 01:31:13,279
SAM: I will use my troll's endurance to reduce
that by 11 points.

1430
01:31:13,279 --> 01:31:15,488
LAURA: Seven points.

1431
01:31:15,488 --> 01:31:20,778
MATT: So crossbow bolt catches you in the back of
the shoulder blades, right where the spine meets

1432
01:31:20,778 --> 01:31:22,811
them. Your body tenses for a second.

1433
01:31:22,811 --> 01:31:39,823
SAM: I touch the arrow and I say, ugh! He's right.
Forcs don't run. They stick in meat and they stay

1434
01:31:39,930 --> 01:31:43,571
there forever. And I turn around and I run back
into the shrak hole!

1435
01:31:43,571 --> 01:31:46,533
(laughing)

1436
01:31:46,533 --> 01:31:54,862
MATT: All right, so when you get to your turn,
you're bolting back. All right. So Mozuu, it's

1437
01:31:54,862 --> 01:31:57,065
back up to your turn.

1438
01:31:57,065 --> 01:31:59,618
DARIN: Can I hold it until the actions are done?

1439
01:31:59,618 --> 01:32:01,752
MATT: I mean, pretty much everyone else is gone.

1440
01:32:01,752 --> 01:32:11,051
DARIN: Can I speak to the Bright Lord? I said I
heard the voice of Sauron. I lied. I never heard

1441
01:32:11,051 --> 01:32:16,943
anything, but I will hear your voice if you would
speak to me.

1442
01:32:16,943 --> 01:32:25,123
MATT: Okay. You use that as your action? All
right, at the top. It is Arby and Talion's turn.

1443
01:32:25,123 --> 01:32:27,309
So, what are you doing?

1444
01:32:27,309 --> 01:32:31,548
LAURA: Do I still have a hold of his blade?

1445
01:32:31,548 --> 01:32:33,184
MATT: Currently, yeah.

1446
01:32:33,184 --> 01:32:39,793
LAURA: Oh, yeah. Can I try to smack it with
himself and say stop hitting yourself! Stop

1447
01:32:39,793 --> 01:32:41,125
hitting yourself!

1448
01:32:41,125 --> 01:32:46,453
MATT: Sure. All right. Go ahead and make-- this
would be an athletics versus athletics.

1449
01:32:46,453 --> 01:32:50,207
LAURA: A 14.

1450
01:32:50,207 --> 01:32:55,674
MATT: 23. As you attempt to do it, he pulls the
blade from your grasp. Cuts your hand a little bit

1451
01:32:55,674 --> 01:32:57,233
but nothing too major.

1452
01:32:57,233 --> 01:33:00,737
LAURA: All right, then I'm going to try to attack
him then.

1453
01:33:00,737 --> 01:33:04,489
MATT: So you have one more attack.

1454
01:33:04,489 --> 01:33:05,644
LAURA: That is a 20!

1455
01:33:05,644 --> 01:33:06,872
MATT: 20 hits!

1456
01:33:06,872 --> 01:33:13,001
LAURA: Seven plus five is 12.

1457
01:33:13,001 --> 01:33:18,123
MATT: All right. 12 points of damage. This time,
the gravewalker gets taken off his feet a little

1458
01:33:18,123 --> 01:33:22,605
bit. He rolls a little bit, just around the side
and gets back up to his feet, maybe five feet,

1459
01:33:22,605 --> 01:33:28,726
almost ten feet from you. Blade's still out, looks
at you, looks at the surrounding scenarios. Seems

1460
01:33:28,726 --> 01:33:32,005
to become somewhat impressed by the fact that
you're still fighting in the midst of such

1461
01:33:32,005 --> 01:33:34,537
immeasurable danger.

1462
01:33:34,537 --> 01:33:45,024
LAURA: And as my bonus action, I'm going to take
my second wind. I'm going to take 1d10 and add five to it.

1463
01:33:45,024 --> 01:33:48,175
So 14 points of damage added back!

1464
01:33:48,175 --> 01:33:53,654
MATT: There you go. At which point, the
gravewalker turns his back on you and steps

1465
01:33:53,654 --> 01:34:00,735
towards Mozuu and says, "Then prove to me. Prove
to me you have what it takes." And reaches down

1466
01:34:00,735 --> 01:34:04,034
and grabs your face, this time finally making
contact. Go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw.

1467
01:34:04,034 --> 01:34:08,196
You can opt to not resist it if you'd like to.

1468
01:34:08,196 --> 01:34:10,581
DARIN: That is 16.

1469
01:34:10,581 --> 01:34:14,314
MATT: Do you want to resist it or you want to let
it happen?

1470
01:34:14,314 --> 01:34:15,475
DARIN: I'm on board.

1471
01:34:15,475 --> 01:34:18,953
MATT: Then you don't need to make a saving throw.
Then that being the case, the brand burns in the

1472
01:34:18,953 --> 01:34:24,425
side of your face. You watch as Mozuu's eyes flare
with a vibrant energy. And as it fades, you now

1473
01:34:24,425 --> 01:34:27,844
see that indeed, this prophecy you spoke earlier
seems to be true.

1474
01:34:27,844 --> 01:34:29,512
DARIN: I'm truly chosen.

1475
01:34:29,512 --> 01:34:34,436
MATT: You are now. As the brand is there, you
glance back and see the pittance that is the

1476
01:34:34,436 --> 01:34:42,077
existence of your previous allies. And the Bright
Lord, as you stand up, goes, "Kill for me." And

1477
01:34:42,077 --> 01:34:44,696
looks back towards Arby.

1478
01:34:44,696 --> 01:34:47,958
TRAVIS: Not me, we're on the same team!

1479
01:34:47,958 --> 01:34:50,015
DARIN: Right, buddy!

1480
01:34:50,072 --> 01:34:52,658
TRAVIS: Betrayers unite!

1481
01:34:52,658 --> 01:34:58,013
MATT: And with that, he's going to go ahead and
pull back Azkar and take two arrow shots at you.

1482
01:34:58,013 --> 01:35:00,895
That is a 23.

1483
01:35:00,895 --> 01:35:02,357
LAURA: Oh, that hits me!

1484
01:35:02,357 --> 01:35:03,664
MATT: And a 19.

1485
01:35:03,664 --> 01:35:04,822
LAURA: Oh no!

1486
01:35:04,822 --> 01:35:12,745
MATT: All right. That is 11 points of piercing
damage and seven points of piercing damage. Both

1487
01:35:12,745 --> 01:35:17,730
arrows slam into your armor; you can feel the
plates break and crumble. These are not normal

1488
01:35:17,730 --> 01:35:22,326
arrows, not with the strength that they're being
tossed at you. That's going to end the

1489
01:35:22,326 --> 01:35:26,265
gravewalker's turn. Skak, you're up. You can see
Eden running back.

1490
01:35:26,265 --> 01:35:29,327
TRAVIS: Yeah. Crossbow.

1491
01:35:29,327 --> 01:35:32,195
MATT: You want to try and hide first?

1492
01:35:32,195 --> 01:35:36,714
TRAVIS: Oh! Does it up my-- if I'm from a hidden
position?

1493
01:35:36,714 --> 01:35:41,295
MATT: Well, if you can manage to hide and move and
he's not aware of where you are? I'll allow it.

1494
01:35:41,295 --> 01:35:43,335
TRAVIS: I will use my bonus action to try and
hide.

1495
01:35:43,335 --> 01:35:44,956
MATT: Okay. So make a stealth check.

1496
01:35:44,956 --> 01:35:46,766
TRAVIS: 27.

1497
01:35:46,766 --> 01:35:48,907
MATT: Make a perception check if you like, Eden.

1498
01:35:48,907 --> 01:35:51,191
SAM: Natural 20.

1499
01:35:51,191 --> 01:35:53,477
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

1500
01:35:53,477 --> 01:36:02,090
MATT: So right as he's running, he glances up and
catches you. Skak, make your attack. No sneak

1501
01:36:02,156 --> 01:36:03,570
attack on this one, unfortunately.

1502
01:36:03,570 --> 01:36:05,450
TRAVIS: Damn! Oh, that's pretty good. 25.

1503
01:36:05,450 --> 01:36:12,262
SAM: That hits, but I will catch that shit. I
mean, catch that shrak and throw it back.

1504
01:36:12,262 --> 01:36:13,891
MATT: Do you have any ki left?

1505
01:36:13,891 --> 01:36:16,021
SAM: It doesn't say I need ki!

1506
01:36:16,021 --> 01:36:18,245
MATT: To throw it back, you need to spend a ki.

1507
01:36:18,245 --> 01:36:20,490
SAM: Oh, I see. I can catch it.

1508
01:36:20,490 --> 01:36:33,420
TRAVIS: 12 points of damage, and I will use fury of
the small to add five extra damage to it, so 17.

1509
01:36:33,420 --> 01:36:35,440
SAM: I rolled 17.

1510
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:36,863
MATT: What?!

1511
01:36:36,863 --> 01:36:41,337
SAM: It's 1d10 plus nine. So I rolled an
eight.

1512
01:36:41,337 --> 01:36:43,117
TRAVIS: What happens?

1513
01:36:43,117 --> 01:36:46,199
MATT: So as he's running, and just catches it.

1514
01:36:46,199 --> 01:36:50,661
TRAVIS: It's not fair. It's not fair!

1515
01:36:50,661 --> 01:36:53,931
I can only do that once a day!

1516
01:36:53,931 --> 01:36:59,403
MATT: All right. Ending Skak's turn. Mozuu, you're
up.

1517
01:36:59,403 --> 01:37:01,771
DARIN: Sorry.

1518
01:37:01,771 --> 01:37:04,644
LAURA: Yeah, you're real sorry. Chosen.

1519
01:37:04,644 --> 01:37:09,479
DARIN: I leap at Arb-Uruk and attempt to rip her
throat out.

1520
01:37:09,479 --> 01:37:14,792
MATT: All right. Make an athletics check against
Arb-Uruk. You make an athletics check as well, as

1521
01:37:14,792 --> 01:37:16,093
it's opposed.

1522
01:37:16,093 --> 01:37:18,739
DARIN: 20.

1523
01:37:18,739 --> 01:37:22,702
LAURA: Oh, no. Athletics. Oh no, he gets me. 12.

1524
01:37:22,702 --> 01:37:26,729
MATT: So you leap onto the front of her. Which, by
the way, you're small in comparison. You're like

1525
01:37:26,729 --> 01:37:30,695
this spider climbing up the body up to the throat.
Go ahead and make an attack.

1526
01:37:30,695 --> 01:37:36,469
DARIN: Okay. 16 plus three. 19.

1527
01:37:36,469 --> 01:37:39,702
MATT: 19. Armor class is 18. Roll a d4 plus your
strength modifier.

1528
01:37:39,702 --> 01:37:43,601
DARIN: That is a five.

1529
01:37:43,601 --> 01:37:48,181
MATT: So you take five points of piercing damage
as Mozuu begins biting chunks out of your throat.

1530
01:37:48,181 --> 01:37:50,661
DARIN: Do I get another attack or is leaping the
attack?

1531
01:37:50,661 --> 01:37:52,151
MATT: I'll consider leaping as part of it.

1532
01:37:52,151 --> 01:37:53,616
DARIN: That's a good thing. Sorry.

1533
01:37:53,616 --> 01:37:54,984
TRAVIS: Sorry!

1534
01:37:54,984 --> 01:37:56,184
MATT: All right. Eden, you're up.

1535
01:37:56,184 --> 01:37:59,551
SAM: Do I have enough movement to get under the
shrak hole?

1536
01:37:59,551 --> 01:38:04,351
MATT: As you ran and then came right back, you
come up from underneath and you're out of the

1537
01:38:04,351 --> 01:38:10,800
shrak hole and you see now Mozuu latched onto
Arb-Uruk, biting into the throat.

1538
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:12,432
SAM: I'm going to attack Mozuu.

1539
01:38:12,432 --> 01:38:13,611
MATT: Go for it.

1540
01:38:13,611 --> 01:38:15,190
SAM: Or is the Bright--

1541
01:38:15,190 --> 01:38:18,195
MATT: The Bright Lord is not that far from you.
You can get to the Bright Lord. You're pretty fast.

1542
01:38:18,195 --> 01:38:19,507
LAURA: Attack Mozuu!

1543
01:38:19,507 --> 01:38:23,124
SAM: I'll attack Mozuu. I choose Mozuu the
Chosen.

1544
01:38:23,124 --> 01:38:24,456
MATT: Go for it.

1545
01:38:24,456 --> 01:38:25,625
SAM: Mozuu!

1546
01:38:25,625 --> 01:38:28,172
DARIN: Mozuu!

1547
01:38:28,172 --> 01:38:31,275
SAM: 20 to hit.

1548
01:38:31,275 --> 01:38:33,828
MATT: 20 to hit? That hits Mozuu, I think.

1549
01:38:33,828 --> 01:38:38,318
DARIN: Oh yes, I'm at 18. Otherwise known as, ow.

1550
01:38:38,318 --> 01:38:40,447
SAM: Eight plus four. 12.

1551
01:38:40,447 --> 01:38:46,072
MATT: So 12 points of bludgeoning damage as out of
nowhere, Eden rushes forward and slams you in the

1552
01:38:46,072 --> 01:38:50,342
side of the body. Almost knocking you off of
Arb-Uruk but not quite strong enough to do so.

1553
01:38:50,342 --> 01:38:54,573
SAM: A second attack. 11 plus seven. 18 to hit!

1554
01:38:54,573 --> 01:38:56,516
MATT: That hits. Roll damage again!

1555
01:38:56,516 --> 01:39:01,555
SAM: Two plus four. So that's six more points of
damage.

1556
01:39:01,555 --> 01:39:04,420
MATT: Six more points of bludgeoning damage. And
you have your bonus action still, if you want to.

1557
01:39:04,420 --> 01:39:09,058
SAM: Oh! One more hit. This is an open-handed hit,
right?

1558
01:39:09,058 --> 01:39:10,533
MATT: I believe so, yeah.

1559
01:39:10,533 --> 01:39:15,749
SAM: No good. That's a 13 to hit.

1560
01:39:15,749 --> 01:39:19,930
MATT: 13. The third and final hit, you manage to
deflect it with your with your arm. It makes no

1561
01:39:19,930 --> 01:39:23,408
impact there. Ending Eden's turn. Up to you and
the gravewalker.

1562
01:39:23,408 --> 01:39:30,854
LAURA: Can I grab a hold of Mozuu and rip him off
me and then hit the gravewalker with him?

1563
01:39:30,854 --> 01:39:32,483
MATT: Sure! Go for it!

1564
01:39:32,483 --> 01:39:35,214
MATT: So make an athletics check and you make an
athletics check as well.

1565
01:39:35,214 --> 01:39:38,590
LAURA: 13.

1566
01:39:38,590 --> 01:39:40,640
DARIN: Ten.

1567
01:39:40,640 --> 01:39:44,763
MATT: Yeah, you tear him off. Go ahead and make an
attack roll. You don't get the proficiency bonus

1568
01:39:44,763 --> 01:39:47,270
on this but you still get your strength bonus.

1569
01:39:47,270 --> 01:39:50,894
LAURA: Just my strength modifier? 18.

1570
01:39:50,894 --> 01:40:00,114
MATT: 18 hits the gravewalker! His AC is 17! I'll
say for this one, roll a d6 and add your strength

1571
01:40:00,114 --> 01:40:01,842
modifier.

1572
01:40:01,842 --> 01:40:05,717
SAM: Kill the tark! For the glory of the uruk!

1573
01:40:05,717 --> 01:40:08,252
MATT: You don't get to reroll your damage roll
because he's not considered--

1574
01:40:08,252 --> 01:40:09,931
LAURA: He's not a two-handed weapon?

1575
01:40:09,931 --> 01:40:13,662
MATT: Sure! You know what, sure! I'll let him be a
two-handed weapon. Yeah, I'll allow it.

1576
01:40:13,662 --> 01:40:14,709
LAURA: So that's ten.

1577
01:40:14,709 --> 01:40:17,427
MATT: So ten points of bludgeoning damage to both
you and the gravewalker.

1578
01:40:17,427 --> 01:40:18,537
DARIN: Guess what?

1579
01:40:18,537 --> 01:40:19,567
MATT and TRAVIS: What?

1580
01:40:19,567 --> 01:40:22,307
LAURA: You're unconscious?

1581
01:40:22,307 --> 01:40:27,889
MATT: After the hit, Mozuu goes limp in your hand
and you're flailing him around in the grasp.

1582
01:40:27,889 --> 01:40:35,610
The gravewalker takes the hit, looks up at
you. He's going to go ahead and make

1583
01:40:35,610 --> 01:40:40,296
one strike with Urfael. That is 20.

1584
01:40:40,296 --> 01:40:41,979
LAURA: Oh no! It hits me.

1585
01:40:41,979 --> 01:40:47,461
MATT: All right, you take eight points of slashing
damage. And that is a 22 to hit.

1586
01:40:47,461 --> 01:40:49,368
LAURA: Oh god. It gets me.

1587
01:40:49,368 --> 01:40:51,638
MATT: You take 12 points of slashing damage.

1588
01:40:51,638 --> 01:40:55,130
LAURA: Oh no! I'm unconscious!

1589
01:40:55,130 --> 01:41:02,415
MATT: You're unconscious? All right, as you fall
unconscious and collapse to the ground, he reaches

1590
01:41:02,415 --> 01:41:07,641
down and grasps the side of your face and you feel
this urge of energy come up from underneath and as

1591
01:41:07,641 --> 01:41:12,451
your eyes flare open, you see the burning, vibrant
eyes of the wraith within the gravewalker say,

1592
01:41:12,451 --> 01:41:20,819
"Stand and join me." Do you want to resist or not?
Make a will save to resist, if you want.

1593
01:41:20,819 --> 01:41:22,359
LAURA: I'm going to try and resist it.

1594
01:41:22,359 --> 01:41:26,620
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw.

1595
01:41:26,620 --> 01:41:28,732
LAURA: Oh shit! 19.

1596
01:41:28,732 --> 01:41:34,635
MATT: And you do. Brought back to the brink, there
the gravewalker stands ahead of you. As you

1597
01:41:34,635 --> 01:41:43,182
resist, he goes, "Fine. I gave you a choice."
Spins the blade around and takes you out from that point.

1598
01:41:43,182 --> 01:41:44,976
SAM: Is she dead?

1599
01:41:44,976 --> 01:41:46,081
MATT: Yeah.

1600
01:41:46,081 --> 01:41:46,931
SAM: Dead dead?

1601
01:41:46,931 --> 01:41:48,314
TRAVIS: Yep. Dead.

1602
01:41:48,314 --> 01:41:53,776
LAURA: I didn't get turnt! And it was worth it!

1603
01:41:53,776 --> 01:41:56,830
MATT: Skak, your turn, up on the edge of the
wall.

1604
01:41:56,830 --> 01:42:02,146
TRAVIS: Can I try and resist the domination? That
I'm under the hold?

1605
01:42:02,146 --> 01:42:03,281
MATT: No.

1606
01:42:03,281 --> 01:42:11,486
TRAVIS: No. Then I will gladly take a-- can I jump
down from the wall? No, crossbow. Is he within

1607
01:42:11,486 --> 01:42:13,828
melee of anybody for sneak attack?

1608
01:42:13,828 --> 01:42:18,504
MATT: Actually, yeah. He would have been in melee
with her, which means he's right next to Talion.

1609
01:42:18,504 --> 01:42:20,631
So, yeah.

1610
01:42:20,631 --> 01:42:22,426
TRAVIS: All right. Crossbow right at him.

1611
01:42:22,426 --> 01:42:25,056
SAM: I don't think I have another resistance to
this this time, I mean, is it cycled through

1612
01:42:25,056 --> 01:42:26,030
again?

1613
01:42:26,030 --> 01:42:28,035
MATT: It would be because you've gone since last
time.

1614
01:42:28,035 --> 01:42:29,563
TRAVIS: With my bonus, can I try and hide?

1615
01:42:29,563 --> 01:42:31,712
MATT: You may.

1616
01:42:31,712 --> 01:42:32,892
TRAVIS: That's 26.

1617
01:42:32,892 --> 01:42:34,339
MATT: Make a perception check.

1618
01:42:34,339 --> 01:42:35,992
SAM: It's not good. It's like eight.

1619
01:42:35,992 --> 01:42:37,032
MATT: All right.

1620
01:42:37,032 --> 01:42:39,196
TRAVIS: How do I get advantage on the rolls? Sneak
attack?

1621
01:42:39,196 --> 01:42:43,540
MATT: Well, you do now that he doesn't see you.

1622
01:42:43,540 --> 01:42:46,563
TRAVIS: Okay great, come on. Damn it! Okay, that's
fine. 18.

1623
01:42:46,563 --> 01:42:48,183
MATT: 18 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

1624
01:42:48,183 --> 01:42:55,277
TRAVIS: Aw. 12, 15, 20.

1625
01:42:55,277 --> 01:43:01,092
SAM: I resist 18 points of damage.

1626
01:43:01,092 --> 01:43:02,566
TRAVIS: Damn it!

1627
01:43:02,566 --> 01:43:09,232
But the tip goes into your chin.

1628
01:43:09,232 --> 01:43:12,892
MATT: Oh my god. That's so great. I love it. I
love it so much.

1629
01:43:12,892 --> 01:43:16,647
TRAVIS: Dang it, Eden! Just take it! Take the
arrow!

1630
01:43:16,647 --> 01:43:20,261
SAM: I'm making a nice collection of your arrows.

1631
01:43:20,261 --> 01:43:23,905
TRAVIS: Throw it at the Bright Lord!

1632
01:43:23,905 --> 01:43:25,545
MATT: All right, that ends your turn, Skak.

1633
01:43:25,545 --> 01:43:26,579
TRAVIS: Yes.

1634
01:43:26,579 --> 01:43:28,109
MATT: Mozuu's unconscious.

1635
01:43:28,109 --> 01:43:29,370
DARIN: Mozuu's dead.

1636
01:43:29,370 --> 01:43:32,012
MATT: Mozuu's pretty gone. Eden, you're up.

1637
01:43:32,012 --> 01:43:39,643
SAM: Yes. All right, Bright Lord, let's see what
you got! Hi-ya!

1638
01:43:39,643 --> 01:43:42,571
LAURA: Shrak is flinging everywhere.

1639
01:43:42,571 --> 01:43:46,341
MATT: Yeah. All across.

1640
01:43:46,341 --> 01:43:57,093
SAM: 13! Ugh! Nine!

1641
01:43:57,093 --> 01:44:06,542
Bonus action! Oh! 18 plus seven, that's 25!

1642
01:44:06,542 --> 01:44:11,258
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll a d6 plus
damage.

1643
01:44:11,258 --> 01:44:17,932
SAM: Oh, you've got a mark on your face from my
hand! Oh, it's a poo mark!

1644
01:44:17,932 --> 01:44:25,716
That's the mark of the shrak! The shrak lord!
One!

1645
01:44:25,716 --> 01:44:27,456
MATT: Plus?

1646
01:44:27,456 --> 01:44:28,631
SAM: Plus four, I guess?

1647
01:44:28,631 --> 01:44:35,303
MATT: All right, so five damage. He's going to use
a legendary action at the end of your turn to do

1648
01:44:35,303 --> 01:44:42,681
dominate on you. He goes, "One mark for another,
uruk brother." Reaches forward to grasp at you.

1649
01:44:42,681 --> 01:44:47,294
Natural 20. Make a wisdom saving throw.

1650
01:44:47,294 --> 01:44:48,753
SAM: I mean, you got a 20!

1651
01:44:48,753 --> 01:44:52,860
MATT: I'll say disadvantage on the wisdom saving
throw, because of the natural 20.

1652
01:44:52,860 --> 01:44:54,629
SAM: Yeah. So seven?

1653
01:44:54,629 --> 01:45:00,947
MATT: As the brand of the gravewalker burns into
your face, suddenly you see now the vision of

1654
01:45:00,947 --> 01:45:06,455
glory, the possible downfall of the Dark Lord and
a new beginning under the Bright Lord here in

1655
01:45:06,455 --> 01:45:13,273
Mordor. And as he pulls the hand away, now the
fray has come to a calm. The villains and the

1656
01:45:13,273 --> 01:45:19,314
current scenario from there and now, your
perspective now ended. The rest of the uruk begin

1657
01:45:19,314 --> 01:45:25,799
to gather around. Face-eater Ur-Gram comes up
behind and the gravewalker looks about to invite

1658
01:45:25,799 --> 01:45:35,254
those that survived the fray now under his grasp.
"Come. We must salvage the shreds. I mean to carve

1659
01:45:35,254 --> 01:45:41,364
"my way northwest." You watch now as a red-orange
flare off in the distance up in the clouds

1660
01:45:41,364 --> 01:45:49,484
signifies the volcanic explosion within Mount Doom
far, far away. "Stand at my side, orcs. For we

1661
01:45:49,484 --> 01:45:58,372
"march on Barad-dűr. The time of the Dark Lord
wanes in the wake of the Bright Lord's wrath."

1662
01:45:58,372 --> 01:46:00,282
And that's where we're going to end it tonight.

1663
01:46:00,282 --> 01:46:03,065
(cheering)

1664
01:46:03,065 --> 01:46:04,453
LAURA: That was awesome!

1665
01:46:04,453 --> 01:46:05,864
MATT: Well done, guys!

1666
01:46:05,864 --> 01:46:08,004
TRAVIS: That was fun!

1667
01:46:08,004 --> 01:46:10,006
LAURA: I died!

1668
01:46:10,006 --> 01:46:16,568
TRAVIS: I want you to know that after that ended,
I went up and shot Eden in his sleep. To rise

1669
01:46:16,568 --> 01:46:19,575
through the ranks.

1670
01:46:19,575 --> 01:46:20,607
MATT: And there you have it.

1671
01:46:20,607 --> 01:46:21,714
TRAVIS: My warchief ambitions.

1672
01:46:21,714 --> 01:46:25,376
DARIN: Well, we tried to hit every angle of the
orcs in the game.

1673
01:46:25,376 --> 01:46:26,899
LAURA: That was so fun!

1674
01:46:26,899 --> 01:46:29,811
MATT: That was great. Guys, well done. That was a
blast.

1675
01:46:29,811 --> 01:46:38,659
SAM: But not as fun as the game that's coming out
on October 10. It's called "Mordor, Mordor, Mordor."

1676
01:46:38,659 --> 01:46:40,317
DARIN: No it is not!

1677
01:46:40,317 --> 01:46:51,321
MATT: Shadow of War, coming out October 10. Also
out on iOS and for Android. WB Games, thank you so

1678
01:46:51,321 --> 01:46:54,692
much for making this happen. We had a blast. Hope
you guys had a good time.

1679
01:46:54,692 --> 01:46:58,389
TRAVIS: That shadow strike is real in the game,
too. It's legit.

1680
01:46:58,389 --> 01:47:03,379
MATT: All right. Well, have a wonderful day. And
is it Thursday yet? Bye.

1681
01:47:03,379 --> 01:47:11,317
