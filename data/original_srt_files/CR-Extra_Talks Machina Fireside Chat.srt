2
00:00:26,108 --> 00:00:27,451
BRIAN: Good evening.

3
00:00:27,451 --> 00:00:38,471
(laughter)

4
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:49,579
BRIAN: Good evening. Welcome to god-knows-what.
This is our very special fireside chat edition of

5
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:57,765
Talks Machina. Travis cannot stop looking at me,
as per usual. I would like to welcome the cast of

6
00:00:57,765 --> 00:01:05,240
Critical Role minus one Ashley the Jenkins. As you
can see, Matt also got the memo about dressing

7
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,475
incredibly fucking sexy tonight.

8
00:01:07,475 --> 00:01:08,897
MATT: Just saying.

9
00:01:09,401 --> 00:01:15,599
BRIAN: We are here to discuss a bunch of overflow
questions from the wrap-up episode. If you guys

10
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:22,501
didn't get a chance to see, it’s free anywhere
that shows on this network are free. So go find

11
00:01:22,501 --> 00:01:31,188
those places. We had a lot of stuff left over so
we wanted to lightning round it and do about 90

12
00:01:31,188 --> 00:01:34,825
minutes worth of stuff, and then we'll do about 90
minutes of worth stuff off-camera that we can't

13
00:01:34,825 --> 00:01:40,726
talk about. How was everyone's break?

14
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:42,745
LAURA and TALIESIN: Great.

15
00:01:42,745 --> 00:01:43,813
LAURA: Happy new year!

16
00:01:43,813 --> 00:01:47,964
BRIAN: Happy new year! I haven't seen you guys in
forever. I was up north dealing with a legal

17
00:01:47,964 --> 00:01:53,600
situation about something that happened at Knotts
Berry Farm, but I got to Skype and see you guys

18
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,278
and Travis was one of my only phone calls.

19
00:01:57,278 --> 00:01:59,597
TRAVIS: Yep, I'll never forget that.

20
00:01:59,597 --> 00:02:01,804
BRIAN: Some of you went abroad.

21
00:02:01,804 --> 00:02:05,653
LAURA: A lot of us went abroad.

22
00:02:05,653 --> 00:02:08,773
TRAVIS: Raise your hand, you travelling dicks.

23
00:02:08,773 --> 00:02:10,595
SAM: Does Hawaii count?

24
00:02:10,595 --> 00:02:13,032
TRAVIS: That's off the mainland.

25
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:18,478
BRIAN: It is off the mainland, off the beaten
land. I stayed at home and watched a lot of Murder

26
00:02:18,478 --> 00:02:24,604
She Wrote, in this very gown. Is this the one you
wore for the last?

27
00:02:24,604 --> 00:02:26,827
MATT: Yeah, I haven't washed it since.

28
00:02:26,827 --> 00:02:32,615
BRIAN: You haven't?! Do you have any idea how much
money this would have been worth before I put it on?

29
00:02:34,322 --> 00:02:37,644
LAURA: It's a good thing it's not colder in here.

30
00:02:37,644 --> 00:02:43,534
BRIAN: I have tape preventing, no matter how low
the temperature drops.

31
00:02:43,534 --> 00:02:45,685
LAURA: I don't think the tape is doing its job I
can still see them.

32
00:02:45,685 --> 00:02:48,413
TRAVIS: He's also getting some good pec quiver.

33
00:02:48,413 --> 00:02:56,907
BRIAN: That's the tape literally squeezing milk
out of my breast because it was put on so tight.

34
00:02:56,907 --> 00:03:03,411
On someone's phone there is an image of Ryan Green
putting nipple tape on me 20 minutes ago. Guys,

35
00:03:03,411 --> 00:03:10,443
speaking of nipple tape, I can't believe this ties
into my first announcement but speaking of nipple

36
00:03:10,443 --> 00:03:21,610
tape, Painter’s Guild with Will Friedle season two
begins on January 8th on ProjectAlpha.com.

37
00:03:22,258 --> 00:03:27,905
MATT: I'm so glad that he's learning to paint
because seeing that first mini he did for your

38
00:03:27,905 --> 00:03:35,025
guys’ home campaign, it damaged me on a spiritual
level. He's gotten so much better!

39
00:03:35,025 --> 00:03:40,349
BRIAN: It damaged so many people the cat-petting
executives here gave him a show. They were like,

40
00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:45,530
"You're so bad at this, we will pay someone to
teach you in front of a camera."

41
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,781
LIAM: He could eventually evolve into Michelangelo
of painting minis, but we will never let him

42
00:03:48,781 --> 00:03:51,415
forget that one.

43
00:03:51,415 --> 00:03:56,604
BRIAN: I have the picture of it on my phone
because I sent a picture to Gil and I said can you

44
00:03:56,604 --> 00:04:01,274
paint this and he goes "Who the fuck?" I was like
Will did this himself!

45
00:04:01,279 --> 00:04:03,856
MARISHA: I would have been like "Nah. We can't.
That can't--"

46
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,488
BRIAN: Yeah he was like, "I might need to just
bleach it and start all over." I said we should do

47
00:04:07,488 --> 00:04:08,759
the same with Will.

48
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:11,891
MARISHA: We got that picture and we used it in the
first season to shame him in the very first

49
00:04:11,891 --> 00:04:17,028
episode. The new season is going to be great!

50
00:04:17,028 --> 00:04:22,500
BRIAN: It is, Painter’s Guild season two, January
8th. Critical Role: Vox Machina Origins number

51
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:29,869
four from Dark Horse Comics will be released
digitally on January 24th.

52
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:33,100
LIAM: That's too far away!

53
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:42,324
BRIAN: No it's a hop, skip and a jump. Grab your
copy at digital.darkhorse.com; Comixology, with an x;

54
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:50,787
iBooks, with an i; Amazon Kindle; Nook; or
Google Play. The fuck is a Nook?

55
00:04:50,787 --> 00:04:57,218
SAM: A Nook, I think, is a Barnes & Noble
proprietary Kindle.

56
00:04:57,218 --> 00:05:01,308
MARISHA: They were a thing before Kindle overran
them.

57
00:05:01,308 --> 00:05:07,049
BRIAN: There are a couple of Barnes & Nobles
around still, but yeah.

58
00:05:07,049 --> 00:05:09,230
SAM: Get yours at Ballard’s Books!

59
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:14,850
BRIAN: People buy their books from Ballard’s
Books. Waldenbooks? Hey guys the Vox Machina D20

60
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:22,080
set is still out of stock. We appreciate your
patience as we wait for the restock and will

61
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,642
notify everyone via social media as soon as the
inventory is in place.

62
00:05:26,642 --> 00:05:33,829
LAURA: That’s true, but I can say that it’s going
to be very soon.

63
00:05:33,829 --> 00:05:35,676
SAM: That is some bullshit!

64
00:05:35,676 --> 00:05:42,084
LAURA: No, it really is gonna be super duper soon.
I just talked to Fernando today about it and it’s

65
00:05:42,084 --> 00:05:45,790
coming up. You’ll be happy.

66
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:53,368
BRIAN: A crucial addition to that last update. The
last batch of the critical role podcast episodes

67
00:05:53,368 --> 00:06:02,410
101 through 115 will be going up on Monday,
January 8th. Now that’s only a few days away.

68
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:07,500
SAM: I’m confused about that. I haven’t recorded
any ads for that, I should probably do that.

69
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,729
BRIAN: That’s because we replaced you with a
gentleman goes by the name of Darin De Paul.

70
00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:13,594
SAM: Ooh! Okay.

71
00:06:13,594 --> 00:06:17,433
BRIAN: He’s more expensive but, says here, easier
to work with.

72
00:06:17,433 --> 00:06:19,042
SAM: I believe that.

73
00:06:19,042 --> 00:06:21,281
BRIAN: Monday, January 8th.

74
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:24,030
SAM: It says it on your card?

75
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:32,710
BRIAN: I would not give people half-true
information. Those last batches, there’s no

76
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:40,493
batches, the last batch of episodes will be out
January 8th. Now does anyone who works here know,

77
00:06:40,493 --> 00:06:46,917
and I look at you: The new campaign, are podcasts
going to be released like in groups also when the

78
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:49,071
new campaign come out for the new episodes?

79
00:06:49,071 --> 00:06:51,296
LAURA: How’s that happening? Do we know yet?

80
00:06:51,296 --> 00:06:52,922
BRIAN: That’s a great question that’s why I--

81
00:06:52,922 --> 00:06:58,588
MARISHA: To be determined says a member of--

82
00:06:58,588 --> 00:07:04,570
TRAVIS: Not in groups, but we're aiming to get
them out much more efficiently.

83
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:07,430
MARISHA: I think we wanted to do it, yeah, more
efficiently.

84
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:11,910
BRIAN: I say wait till you’re 101 episodes in
again and then do it.

85
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:16,511
MATT: They will be happening much more
consistently.

86
00:07:16,511 --> 00:07:26,961
BRIAN: What else do I have to go over? Yes this is
live. You know Marisha’s guesting on As In N.E. Wisdom.

87
00:07:26,961 --> 00:07:28,661
MARISHA: Good, close.

88
00:07:28,661 --> 00:07:30,692
BRIAN: This Tuesday. What is it?

89
00:07:30,692 --> 00:07:32,410
MARISHA: Asinine.

90
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:39,278
BRIAN: Asinine Wisdom. This Tuesday the 9th at
9:00 on Twitch.

91
00:07:39,278 --> 00:07:44,721
MARISHA: One of our new shows where we debate
about really dumb shit.

92
00:07:44,721 --> 00:07:45,902
SAM: Marisha.

93
00:07:45,902 --> 00:07:47,088
MARISHA: Yeah?

94
00:07:47,088 --> 00:07:51,231
SAM: I was asked to be on that show. Would you be
pissed at me if I did that show before your

95
00:07:51,231 --> 00:07:54,623
Signal Boost show?

96
00:07:54,623 --> 00:08:00,636
MARISHA: Considering Signal Boost has been on
hiatus for six months. It doesn’t matter.

97
00:08:00,636 --> 00:08:02,833
SAM: I don’t watch the channel.

98
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,212
BRIAN: Yeah, we know.

99
00:08:04,212 --> 00:08:08,235
SAM: Not a big fan of geek stuff really.

100
00:08:08,235 --> 00:08:11,381
MARISHA: No, please do it, go for it.

101
00:08:11,381 --> 00:08:13,340
BRIAN: Sam. Did you know that the--

102
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,779
SAM: Hey! What’s up with Marisha’s show?

103
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:22,452
BRIAN: We just plugged it for the amount of time
it deserved.

104
00:08:22,452 --> 00:08:27,991
MARISHA: We wanted to just take a break, sometimes
we move on. This is actually a good question. This

105
00:08:27,991 --> 00:08:31,988
is a good question because a lot of people will be
like "Why did you cancel this show?" "Why did you

106
00:08:31,988 --> 00:08:39,897
cancel that show?" The answer is there are 1000
reasons why you could and maybe cancel a show and

107
00:08:39,897 --> 00:08:42,272
each show is going to be like unique in its own
way.

108
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,919
SAM: Is it because I didn’t go on the show?

109
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:49,343
MARISHA: It might be because you didn’t come on
the show. No, honestly, we wanted to mix it up a

110
00:08:49,343 --> 00:08:50,219
little bit.

111
00:08:50,219 --> 00:08:58,391
BRIAN: Considering how well certain clips or viral
music videos of you how well they do on YouTube,

112
00:08:58,391 --> 00:09:04,612
you would think a Signal Boost would have been
right up your Tiger Woods alley. Guys, did you

113
00:09:04,612 --> 00:09:13,710
know the Critical Role podcast, speaking of, was
one of Podbean’s top ten podcasts of 2017? Can you

114
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:19,685
believe it? Sam, did you get an invite to the
Podbean awards because mine must have been lost in

115
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:20,842
the mail.

116
00:09:20,842 --> 00:09:25,631
SAM: There was a mysterious bowl of pinto beans
left on my doorstep.

117
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:28,186
BRIAN: That’s from them! That’s the invite. It’s
inside the beans.

118
00:09:28,186 --> 00:09:29,547
SAM: It’s like a secret society.

119
00:09:29,547 --> 00:09:31,886
BRIAN: Yes, it’s inside one of the beans.

120
00:09:31,886 --> 00:09:39,299
LIAM: I’m offended on behalf of All Work No Play.
I know we only do one episode a year.

121
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:44,972
SAM: Side note, we’ve had an episode recorded
since September that I haven’t edited yet.

122
00:09:44,972 --> 00:09:46,283
BRIAN: Oh boy.

123
00:09:46,283 --> 00:09:49,116
MATT: Quality over quantity.

124
00:09:49,116 --> 00:09:55,422
BRIAN: Our questions for tonight are what was left
over from the thousands that were sent in for our

125
00:09:55,422 --> 00:10:01,292
wrap-up episode. Dani and Courtney are here, as
they are every week, but this time they are

126
00:10:01,292 --> 00:10:05,926
looking the the chat so if you guys have some
questions, they better blow us the fuck away

127
00:10:05,926 --> 00:10:11,862
because in my hand is a stack. If you are going to
submit one, maybe, "Where did the name Critical

128
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:18,903
Role come from?" or "Matt, is DMing fun?" Some of
those questions maybe we could just leave for

129
00:10:18,903 --> 00:10:27,578
another time. The last announcement for tonight is
the new campaign starts next week. Okay.

130
00:10:27,578 --> 00:10:30,434
SAM: That's the most important announcement!

131
00:10:30,434 --> 00:10:39,023
BRIAN: Okay, the new campaign starts next week
January 11th, at 7:00. I want to begin by asking

132
00:10:39,023 --> 00:10:45,587
how it’s going in the creation of the characters.
What's the biggest hurdle or challenge you're

133
00:10:45,587 --> 00:10:48,854
facing right now coming up with a new person?

134
00:10:48,854 --> 00:10:50,388
MARISHA: Culture shock.

135
00:10:50,388 --> 00:10:53,022
BRIAN: Tell me about it.

136
00:10:53,022 --> 00:11:03,610
MARISHA: We're all doing pretty different things.
It’s like I don't know how to D&D anymore

137
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,933
and it's scary.

138
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:08,581
LAURA: Are we allowed to say what we did?

139
00:11:08,581 --> 00:11:14,896
MATT: Yeah, every person is doing a session zero
at home in private, just like a very brief warm up

140
00:11:14,896 --> 00:11:18,363
to feel out the character and if there's anything
they want to change before we really

141
00:11:18,363 --> 00:11:20,304
started the campaign.

142
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:23,814
BRIAN: Those were not filmed or recorded for all
the people who have been asking us. None of that

143
00:11:23,814 --> 00:11:25,950
is going to be released at any time.

144
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,802
MATT: Our little nuggets just for us to have for
ourselves.

145
00:11:28,802 --> 00:11:29,828
LAURA: Has everybody played?

146
00:11:29,828 --> 00:11:31,663
TRAVIS: No, Liam and Sam are tomorrow.

147
00:11:31,663 --> 00:11:36,575
LAURA: Oh my gosh, so we're the only ones who have
done it. Oh gosh.

148
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:39,345
MARISHA: It was so fun! Oh my god!

149
00:11:39,345 --> 00:11:45,244
LAURA: My hardest one is that I kept wanting to
say "darling" as I was talking. I caught myself do

150
00:11:45,244 --> 00:11:49,064
it out loud one time and I was like, "Ooh, I
really need to not do that."

151
00:11:49,064 --> 00:11:54,761
BRIAN: Because your disposition is just so
naturally pleasant in real life, it just flows.

152
00:11:54,761 --> 00:12:00,555
It's how shitty things just flow out of me all the
time.

153
00:12:00,555 --> 00:12:04,135
Who is happy with the way they rolled besides Liam?

154
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:05,869
LAURA: I'm happy with my roll.

155
00:12:05,869 --> 00:12:07,204
LIAM: Marisha has got to be happy.

156
00:12:07,204 --> 00:12:08,645
BRIAN: Yeah? Are you happy, did you do okay?

157
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:09,743
MARISHA: I did all right.

158
00:12:09,743 --> 00:12:11,107
TRAVIS: I shit the bed.

159
00:12:11,107 --> 00:12:13,615
BRIAN: You shit the bed? And then how did you roll?

160
00:12:13,615 --> 00:12:19,773
TRAVIS: Not great. I got three single digit
categories again.

161
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:21,584
MATT: I think Ashley's got you beat.

162
00:12:21,584 --> 00:12:26,364
LIAM: But it was all under his watchful eye.

163
00:12:26,364 --> 00:12:29,624
MATT: She didn't roll poorly, but you know, she
has some--

164
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:31,934
LAURA: She rolled some pretty fucking low numbers, Matt.

165
00:12:31,934 --> 00:12:35,294
MATT: And I'm so happy she did. Those are my
favorite! Low stats are awesome!

166
00:12:35,294 --> 00:12:36,693
BRIAN: It's going to play well into the character.

167
00:12:36,693 --> 00:12:37,868
MATT: It really is. I'm excited.

168
00:12:37,868 --> 00:12:40,785
SAM: Matt, does anyone have a stat lower than my
lowest stat?

169
00:12:40,785 --> 00:12:42,395
MATT: Which ones your lowest again?

170
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:43,520
SAM: Well, I can't say.

171
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,655
MATT: You can't say. I think so, I think Ashley's
is lower.

172
00:12:45,655 --> 00:12:50,106
LAURA: Oh, I want to know. Hold up fingers
underneath the couch so I can see what it is.

173
00:12:50,106 --> 00:12:58,043
BRIAN: This is the lamest-- Talk about silhouette
watch. Why are you showing me? Don't show me; I'm

174
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:09,887
not looking good. Guys, was there anything from
the wrap up episode-- I know we were here for five

175
00:13:09,887 --> 00:13:16,428
plus hours shooting that-- but was there anything
that you wanted to ask each other or ask Matt, or

176
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:20,265
Matt that you wanted to ask, before we jump into
the questions?

177
00:13:20,265 --> 00:13:22,562
Was there anything left unresolved?

178
00:13:22,562 --> 00:13:29,788
LIAM: Well, months ago you hinted a little bit at
something, but didn't want to go into full detail,

179
00:13:29,788 --> 00:13:35,974
behind the scenes, because we were still knee deep
in it all. It wasn't just me, a couple of us

180
00:13:35,974 --> 00:13:42,571
asked, what would have happened if Vax hadn't
stuck his dick in the mashed potatoes and stopped

181
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:46,921
Raishan from doing what she was going to do, and
you mentioned that she'd--

182
00:13:46,921 --> 00:13:50,156
and what would happen next?

183
00:13:50,156 --> 00:13:53,388
MATT: Oh right, if he hadn't done that then she
would have gotten the information she needed from

184
00:13:53,388 --> 00:13:59,831
Thordak’s corpse. The main thing was she was
trying to get to the corpse of Thordak to use the

185
00:13:59,831 --> 00:14:07,897
torturous Speak with Dead spell to extract
information from him on where Opash's lair was,

186
00:14:07,897 --> 00:14:13,369
would have found out information she needed to do
the dracolich transition and then she would have

187
00:14:13,369 --> 00:14:20,711
just fucked off. She's a long term person, once
she had dealt with the immediate issue of the

188
00:14:20,711 --> 00:14:25,145
disease and her slowly degenerating then she would
have taken

189
00:14:25,145 --> 00:14:27,071
all the time she wanted as a dracolich.

190
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,525
LAURA: She could be a villain in this next
campaign.

191
00:14:28,525 --> 00:14:32,915
MATT: That was essentially what was going to
happen, yeah. If you guys didn't stop her, then

192
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:37,564
she would have gone off on her own, done
everything she could to be untraceable and

193
00:14:37,564 --> 00:14:42,896
probably would have come up as a villain later in
this next campaign. But that didn't happen.

194
00:14:42,896 --> 00:14:45,020
LIAM: So if we hadn't run blindly in she would
have poofed--

195
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:48,565
LAURA: If <i>you</i> hadn't run blindly in--

196
00:14:48,565 --> 00:14:51,453
MATT: Her whole deal was to let her have a moment
with the corpse.

197
00:14:51,453 --> 00:14:54,435
TRAVIS: Quit sticking your dick in the mashed
potatoes man, god, fuck.

198
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:57,678
LIAM: That's what campaign two is for, that's a
Beastie Boys reference.

199
00:14:57,678 --> 00:14:59,582
MATT: He gets that feature at level 14.

200
00:14:59,582 --> 00:15:01,125
TRAVIS: Tater fucker.

201
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:04,712
(laughter)

202
00:15:04,712 --> 00:15:09,506
LIAM: The new team presumably, what you had said
to me once was, would have run into her having

203
00:15:09,506 --> 00:15:16,026
lorded over where we're going to be. You talked
about her being the next-- Shitting all over

204
00:15:16,026 --> 00:15:19,266
everything where we're going to be.

205
00:15:19,266 --> 00:15:21,968
MATT: There would have been a 20 year jump, she
would have had time to establish herself in an

206
00:15:21,968 --> 00:15:26,623
area on the new continent and would have been one
of the major players in that area.

207
00:15:26,623 --> 00:15:30,663
LIAM: Part of her argument during negotiations
was, "I'll get what I want and then you won’t have

208
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:34,763
to deal with me at all, I'll be gone." She would
have just pooped on Wildemount.

209
00:15:34,763 --> 00:15:39,719
MATT: She would have been like, "You guys have
Tal'Dorei. That's fine; I have ideas elsewhere."

210
00:15:40,895 --> 00:15:46,507
BRIAN: Taliesin, how’s your campaign for mayor of
Tucson going?

211
00:15:46,507 --> 00:15:51,395
(laughter)

212
00:15:51,395 --> 00:15:53,295
TALIESIN: I've got a firm shot at it.

213
00:15:53,295 --> 00:15:57,337
(laughter)

214
00:15:57,337 --> 00:16:01,883
MARISHA: Poor Taliesin. It’s been nothing but jokes!

215
00:16:01,883 --> 00:16:05,147
TALIESIN: No, I've been loving it.

216
00:16:05,953 --> 00:16:09,793
MARISHA: I said it looked like he was ending a
second year of finishing school.

217
00:16:09,793 --> 00:16:17,987
BRIAN: Absolutely. Just for that, unless you guys
had more stuff you wanted to ask each other or

218
00:16:17,987 --> 00:16:20,655
Matt, if you think of anything speak up.

219
00:16:20,655 --> 00:16:25,572
ALL: (singing) So long, farewell, 
auf wiedersehen, goodbye!

220
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,960
BRIAN: Taliesin, just for being a good sport--

221
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,266
TALIESIN: This was my purchase in Berlin. I'm
quite pleased with it.

222
00:16:31,266 --> 00:16:34,262
BRIAN: It looks great. Well, just for being a good
sport,

223
00:16:34,262 --> 00:16:36,457
I'm going to give the first question to Travis.

224
00:16:36,457 --> 00:16:37,887
TALIESIN: Thank god.

225
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:42,957
BRIAN: Travis, this comes from Seth Taylor. "What
was one of the most memorable moments for you that

226
00:16:42,957 --> 00:16:47,866
your negative intelligence made a situation go not
the way you wanted?"

227
00:16:47,866 --> 00:16:49,640
TRAVIS: What was one of the most <i>memorable</i> moments?

228
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,041
BRIAN: Yeah.

229
00:16:52,760 --> 00:17:03,127
TRAVIS: I mean I loved giving three vials of blood
to the Vasselheim trader instead of the two that

230
00:17:03,127 --> 00:17:09,318
he was asking for. That was one of the first
moments where I was like, "Oh wait, there's so

231
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:12,569
much I can do being this stupid."

232
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:15,437
MATT: Oh yeah, man, bartering Grog, that's legendary.

233
00:17:15,437 --> 00:17:19,526
TRAVIS: It's so fun and that was the first time
where I think Laura also was like, "I'm going to

234
00:17:19,526 --> 00:17:22,588
fucking kill you."

235
00:17:22,588 --> 00:17:34,294
BRIAN: The first time, yeah. Liam, question from
LazyGothy, little bit lazy little bit gothy.

236
00:17:34,294 --> 00:17:39,417
Aren't we all? Where/when did you first get Simon?
What was the background?

237
00:17:39,417 --> 00:17:44,120
LIAM: Oh shit, I don't remember, Matt. 
Pathfinder. Home.

238
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,024
SAM: Did you <i>buy</i> him? Did you <i>find</i> him?

239
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,566
LAURA: No, you got him off of somebody.

240
00:17:48,566 --> 00:17:51,227
TRAVIS: Did you <i>make</i> him in the forges of Nithfluflop?

241
00:17:51,227 --> 00:17:52,247
LIAM: That's it, that's totally it.

242
00:17:52,247 --> 00:17:53,274
LAURA: Nithfluflop?

243
00:17:53,274 --> 00:17:54,688
LIAM: Nithflufloff.

244
00:17:54,688 --> 00:17:59,022
MATT: No, he was a random treasure find. I don't
think I remember specifically when it was,

245
00:17:59,022 --> 00:18:00,638
but it was early.

246
00:18:00,638 --> 00:18:02,725
SAM: Is that a common item? Like is that a thing
that exists in D&D?

247
00:18:02,725 --> 00:18:08,588
MATT: It existed in Pathfinder, yeah. It wasn't a
powerful item it just became a snake, then it went

248
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:14,951
and bit something and then it became a belt again.
But I think that good magical items are ones that

249
00:18:14,951 --> 00:18:19,571
are not just useful in the game, but eventually
become a small portion of your character’s

250
00:18:19,571 --> 00:18:25,388
identity. I think that's a good example of that.
It wasn't entirely useful all the time, but every

251
00:18:25,388 --> 00:18:28,439
now and then it was but it just became part of Vax.

252
00:18:28,439 --> 00:18:32,006
LIAM: He might have actually accomplished
something for me, once. Maybe twice.

253
00:18:32,006 --> 00:18:36,518
MARISHA: Didn't you use him to scare some poor
merchant or something once?

254
00:18:36,518 --> 00:18:39,590
LIAM: I cheered up a kid, showed him my snake.

255
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:47,558
MATT: At the end of the campaign, on your way to
the forge.

256
00:18:47,558 --> 00:18:56,488
LIAM: He was my pet and he was less problematic
than Vex's pet, and it was easy. Like a belt that

257
00:18:56,488 --> 00:18:58,318
turns into a snake.

258
00:18:58,318 --> 00:19:04,588
BRIAN: Yeah, all right, I see you going all night.
Because we're five. Marisha, at some point in what

259
00:19:04,588 --> 00:19:10,919
I'm about to read you there will be a question.
This is from TiamatZX: Marisha, over the course of

260
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:15,615
the Conclave Arc we've seen Keyleth slowly
overcome her hesitancy about falling in love with

261
00:19:15,615 --> 00:19:21,719
Vax, with moments like the talk with Vex in the
hot springs and Pike trying to convince her to be

262
00:19:21,719 --> 00:19:27,542
more comfortable with him. This is the part where
there's a question. What would you say was the

263
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:31,128
only thing that made her take that chance?

264
00:19:31,418 --> 00:19:34,541
MARISHA: I mean it was answered actually in the
question.

265
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,082
BRIAN: Fantastic, we can--

266
00:19:36,082 --> 00:19:44,345
MARISHA: Yeah. It was a combination of you giving
your seal of approval and Pike being like, "Hey

267
00:19:44,345 --> 00:19:50,593
girl, someday we're going to die and you're going
to regret not loving somebody!" I was like "Aw

268
00:19:50,593 --> 00:19:55,912
shit, she's right." That was basically it.

269
00:19:55,912 --> 00:19:59,066
MATT: I don't remember it like that, but I <i>want</i>
to remember it like that.

270
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:01,689
BRIAN: That's how those characters sounded.

271
00:20:01,689 --> 00:20:07,170
MARISHA: Actually I think what she said was, "You
should just have fun."

272
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:09,530
I guess it is what she said.

273
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:16,692
MATT: I'm pretty sure it is one of Sarenrae main
stipulations in the religion. "Just have fun."

274
00:20:16,692 --> 00:20:18,879
BRIAN: You be you.

275
00:20:18,879 --> 00:20:24,120
LIAM: Also, when Vex finally stop making the hork
sound, both of our shoulders dropped.

276
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:28,239
LAURA: It's true.

277
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:35,711
BRIAN: The hork heard around the world, a memoir.
Sam, question from @YourRedDog.

278
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:37,818
SAM: Oh, Clifford.

279
00:20:37,818 --> 00:20:51,040
BRIAN: Yes, Clifford. Sam, Scanlan's one man
attack on the mansion as a triceratops is one of

280
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:56,851
my, @YourRedDog’s, favorite moments of the
campaign. How much of that went according to plan

281
00:20:56,851 --> 00:20:58,850
and how much was improvised?

282
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:09,620
SAM: Plan? I think the plan was I was supposed to
create a diversion by setting a fire. Until I

283
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:17,399
realized I had no means of creating fire, and
found myself inside the place as a dinosaur

284
00:21:17,399 --> 00:21:22,760
surrounded by archers. There was no plan at all.

285
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,685
TRAVIS: And then the Stinking Cloud and then the
goliath came out.

286
00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:31,079
LAURA: I think that was the moment when I was
like, "I'm in love with Scanlan." Not Vex, Laura.

287
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:33,689
LIAM: Yeah, your face was manic, 
for that entire thing.

288
00:21:33,689 --> 00:21:37,091
SAM: That was an hour of just me and Matt, or felt
like an hour anyway.

289
00:21:37,091 --> 00:21:38,586
MATT: That was about an hour.

290
00:21:38,586 --> 00:21:40,451
SAM: It was amazing.

291
00:21:40,451 --> 00:21:43,290
BRIAN: Every hour with Matt is.

292
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:53,010
SAM: Yeah, none of that was planned and it was
just so fortuitous and it was one of my favorite

293
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,677
moments of the whole campaign.

294
00:21:54,677 --> 00:21:57,061
BRIAN: Well, it was @YourRedDog’s favorite moment.

295
00:21:57,061 --> 00:22:01,888
SAM: The writers, you know, they had a different
scenario where-- it was contrived.

296
00:22:01,888 --> 00:22:06,961
LIAM: There was a great art in the Christmas
Gallery. I don't know the artist's name yet

297
00:22:06,961 --> 00:22:14,071
because it was their first art ever. It was one of
two clockwork pieces done, and it shows just

298
00:22:14,071 --> 00:22:20,402
different vignettes, and they did, in a circle,
the Scanbo moment. And it had Scanlan with the

299
00:22:20,402 --> 00:22:25,227
bandana on his head, but holding Bigby's Hand like
a gigantic AK.

300
00:22:25,876 --> 00:22:28,967
BRIAN: That's amazing.

301
00:22:28,967 --> 00:22:32,483
SAM: And that was fun. And that was early on too.

302
00:22:32,483 --> 00:22:35,666
MATT: Yeah, that was during the
Whitestone/Briarwoods arc.

303
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:38,557
TRAVIS: "I'm going to kill everyone on this
motherfucking house!"

304
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:47,704
BRIAN: Yeah, that's right. That was back when it
was fun. Taliesin, question for you from

305
00:22:47,704 --> 00:22:54,168
@bae_warden. "How aware or conscious was Percy of
everything that Vex was doing and saying in an

306
00:22:54,168 --> 00:23:01,457
effort to help him out of his Orthax and
Briarwoods induced darkness/stupor?"

307
00:23:03,156 --> 00:23:14,494
TALIESIN: Pretty aware, I would say. He was
definitely not the worst he’d been. I was not

308
00:23:14,494 --> 00:23:22,387
prepared to where that was going to go. There was
no understanding of how the guns or the curse

309
00:23:22,387 --> 00:23:25,113
worked, at all, until it just started happening.

310
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:28,183
MATT: Like a lot of curses do.

311
00:23:28,183 --> 00:23:35,117
TALIESIN: There was no conversation about that at
all. That was just me as player sitting going,

312
00:23:35,117 --> 00:23:46,565
"What the fuck is happening right now? What is
this? Oh no. I may have made very poor choices. I

313
00:23:46,565 --> 00:23:52,137
didn't actually even know where my character was
at that point. You just went with it, man. It was

314
00:23:52,242 --> 00:23:53,965
kind of crazy.

315
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:58,168
MATT: It was like the DM's gift. Like, here's a
really tragic backstory, filled with violence...

316
00:23:58,168 --> 00:24:02,845
Loosely. Have fun with it. And I was like, "Oh, I will."

317
00:24:02,845 --> 00:24:05,358
(laughter)

318
00:24:05,358 --> 00:24:10,532
BRIAN: Well, the best part of doing the show with
our brand new fireplace. I don't know if we can

319
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:15,949
get a wide shot here. But when I'm done with the
card, I can just literally throw it into the fire.

320
00:24:15,949 --> 00:24:18,549
(laughter)

321
00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:26,790
BRIAN: Laura, question for you from
@magestictrinket, how fitting. "Vex promised the

322
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:32,321
Raven Queen that she would destroy Orcus, in
exchange for Vax returning after being killed by

323
00:24:32,321 --> 00:24:38,119
the kraken, as we know. Does she have any plans or
concerns about upholding that contract?"

324
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:39,580
MARISHA: That's a good question.

325
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:46,089
LAURA: I totally thought that she was going to
make us do that. I guess I'm pretty happy that she

326
00:24:46,089 --> 00:24:54,131
didn't' because, I don't-- I'm pretty sure that we
would've died before we got to Vecna, if we did go

327
00:24:54,131 --> 00:24:56,218
and fight Orcus.

328
00:24:56,218 --> 00:25:00,750
MATT: Well, it was more like, "I will give you my
soul, in exchange for my sister," is something

329
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,300
that a god could be like "Okay, I'll accept that."

330
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,197
LAURA: Yeah.

331
00:25:04,197 --> 00:25:08,186
MATT: "I myself personally will murder the Demon
Prince of Undeath in the bottom layer of the

332
00:25:08,186 --> 00:25:11,131
Abyss," she's like, "Heh, sure."

333
00:25:11,131 --> 00:25:16,123
LAURA: Aw. I volunteered all of us together.

334
00:25:16,123 --> 00:25:25,319
MATT: Right. From her perspective, that was
something that, if Orcus became a prominent issue

335
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:30,219
immediately, then maybe she'd call it in. But for
the time being, I think she also felt that she'd

336
00:25:30,219 --> 00:25:36,694
claimed enough attention and happiness from the
family here. Taking Vax.

337
00:25:36,694 --> 00:25:44,359
LAURA: I also, as me and as Vex, had no fucking
concept of what Orcus really was, when I offered

338
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:49,430
that. Like, at all. It wasn't until afterwards I
was like, "Hey Matt, can I learn some stuff about

339
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:55,099
Orcus? Because Vex is doing a lot of research
after she did that," and he was like, "Okay." He

340
00:25:55,099 --> 00:25:57,780
sent it over and I was like, "Oh no, this is
impossible!"

341
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,461
(laughter)

342
00:25:59,461 --> 00:26:02,946
MATT: Some of the lore stuff that you had
discovered as Vex and you were like "Oh."

343
00:26:02,946 --> 00:26:04,419
LAURA: "We're doomed."

344
00:26:04,419 --> 00:26:05,378
BRIAN: That was after you said that?

345
00:26:05,378 --> 00:26:06,528
LAURA: Yeah.

346
00:26:06,528 --> 00:26:13,074
BRIAN: That shows your level of commitment to your
family, that you would choose to take on something

347
00:26:13,074 --> 00:26:17,330
like that. I know you're not somebody who's
comfortable with compliments, but I thought I

348
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:21,885
might throw that one your way. Look this one's
just blank, what the fuck am I supposed to do with

349
00:26:21,885 --> 00:26:24,083
this, write my own?

350
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,805
TRAVIS: Throw it into the fire.

351
00:26:25,805 --> 00:26:33,280
BRIAN: Toss it into the fire! Up next, hey guys,
Madam Socks reminded us, did we not talk about

352
00:26:33,443 --> 00:26:39,430
this on the wrap up? A, it was a while ago, B, we
were all quite drunk. "What happened to Keyleth's

353
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:40,951
mother?" We didn't go over that?

354
00:26:40,951 --> 00:26:42,896
LAURA: Oh! That's right, we didn't! We didn't ever
talk about that!

355
00:26:42,896 --> 00:26:44,910
BRIAN: I know we meant to get to it.

356
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:48,250
MARISHA: I thought we did a Talks forever and ever
ago.

357
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:50,959
BRIAN: I think it might have been discussed on Talks.

358
00:26:50,959 --> 00:26:53,470
LAURA: I don't remember ever hearing about what
happened to Keyleth's mother.

359
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:58,684
MARISHA: She's dead. But I guess we don't know how
she died.

360
00:26:58,684 --> 00:27:03,543
MATT: Well, there's elements of the story and
campaign that I like to leave somewhat vague for

361
00:27:03,543 --> 00:27:04,773
people who are building their own

362
00:27:04,773 --> 00:27:06,939
narratives and stuff.

363
00:27:06,939 --> 00:27:09,042
BRIAN: Oh I see. It's all about money for you.

364
00:27:09,042 --> 00:27:14,798
MATT: Yeah. if you pay me enough, I'll happily
tell you. No, that's one of the elements I want to

365
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:19,216
keep vague for the purposes of other writers out
there.

366
00:27:19,216 --> 00:27:27,522
LAURA: I like to imagine she's alive, and living
under the water, with one leg. Because her leg was

367
00:27:27,522 --> 00:27:31,835
discovered, and that's the only thing that was
recovered, right? So I think she's a pirate

368
00:27:31,835 --> 00:27:34,361
with a peg leg now.

369
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,209
MARISHA: Like a mermaid pirate.

370
00:27:36,209 --> 00:27:37,670
LAURA: How fucking cool would that be?

371
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:40,710
MARISHA: She's a mermaid pirate. That’s actually
kind of awesome.

372
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:43,544
LAURA: That’s what I think happened.

373
00:27:43,544 --> 00:27:46,042
MARISHA: Oh yeah, that's right, all they did is
discover the leg.

374
00:27:46,042 --> 00:27:48,731
MATT: Yeah, that was the one remnant of the battle
that they found.

375
00:27:48,731 --> 00:27:50,820
LIAM: Cliff diving accident.

376
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:51,812
LAURA: Yeah.

377
00:27:51,812 --> 00:27:54,211
MARISHA: That would be kind of rad.

378
00:27:54,211 --> 00:27:56,452
LAURA and MARISHA: That would be tight.

379
00:27:56,452 --> 00:28:01,036
BRIAN: Question for you, but before that, how are
you feeling about the new campaign?

380
00:28:01,036 --> 00:28:08,392
MATT: I am super excited, and I am really
stressed, but I'm super excited. I mean, I've

381
00:28:08,392 --> 00:28:15,241
disappeared for-- half of our holiday break was me
just working on the campaign, I'm sorry.

382
00:28:15,241 --> 00:28:19,891
BRIAN: I disappeared for half the holiday break
too and I'm sorry, Ashley, but it was out of my

383
00:28:19,891 --> 00:28:23,071
control, they came in the middle of the night.

384
00:28:23,071 --> 00:28:24,058
Anyway.

385
00:28:24,058 --> 00:28:25,857
TRAVIS: Pay those parking tickets.

386
00:28:25,857 --> 00:28:31,341
MATT: I'm excited, I'm finishing up the details of
the whole continent map right now.

387
00:28:31,341 --> 00:28:34,940
BRIAN: We are saving character reveal, we are
saving race reveal,

388
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:38,768
we are saving all of that for the campaign.

389
00:28:38,768 --> 00:28:44,879
MATT: We're holding it for that. I want to
experience the first game where all the characters

390
00:28:44,879 --> 00:28:48,525
come together as a group, the same with these guys.

391
00:28:48,525 --> 00:28:56,903
SAM: You have long arcs planned? Do you have the
first session planned, do you have the first three

392
00:28:56,903 --> 00:28:59,112
sessions planned?

393
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:05,288
MATT: Depending on what you guys do and where you
go because that's always expansive. I have the

394
00:29:05,288 --> 00:29:10,953
first six or so episodes of story pretty well
beat-ed out, from there I have loose arcs to

395
00:29:10,953 --> 00:29:14,784
bridge all those, and then I have long-term arcs.
I have level ten,

396
00:29:14,784 --> 00:29:18,117
level 15 arcs already kind of worked out.

397
00:29:18,117 --> 00:29:21,662
LAURA: What if we just completely fuck up and--

398
00:29:21,662 --> 00:29:26,726
TALIESIN: We could basically do sim farm if you
want. We could all decide to become sharecroppers,

399
00:29:26,726 --> 00:29:31,041
and that could just be the show. Are we going to
do eggplants for this next season,

400
00:29:31,041 --> 00:29:33,762
or are we going to do carrots?

401
00:29:33,762 --> 00:29:36,565
MATT: That would be the fastest sunset of a
campaign ever.

402
00:29:36,565 --> 00:29:39,961
MARISHA: We just open a B&B, it's great.

403
00:29:39,961 --> 00:29:45,162
MATT: We get to session 12, and I'm like "All
right, guys. As you all gather your harvest for

404
00:29:45,162 --> 00:29:52,443
the fall, you look off to the setting sun and
think, 'My kids will eat well next year.'" And

405
00:29:52,443 --> 00:29:55,999
that's our campaign. Thank you for joining us,
guys.

406
00:29:55,999 --> 00:30:01,504
BRIAN: Probably not going to make a ton of shirts
for this one, but hope you like the characters.

407
00:30:01,504 --> 00:30:05,402
LIAM: This game is just Cooking Mama.

408
00:30:05,402 --> 00:30:08,582
LAURA: Oh, I love that game!

409
00:30:08,582 --> 00:30:11,333
MATT: Stardew Valley: D&D Version would be great.

410
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:13,864
LAURA: Cooking Mama, taught me how to correctly
beat eggs.

411
00:30:13,864 --> 00:30:15,627
MARISHA: Oh, yeah, because you actually had to do
the little--

412
00:30:15,627 --> 00:30:18,318
LAURA: Yeah, do it and then switch.

413
00:30:18,318 --> 00:30:21,503
BRIAN: Cooking Mama was the one that told me the
other nuns didn't like me.

414
00:30:21,503 --> 00:30:24,772
(laughter)

415
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:36,063
BRIAN: I'm sorry. I snuck that one in there. We
did, however, you're not going to get too much

416
00:30:36,063 --> 00:30:38,165
juice out of us tonight.

417
00:30:38,863 --> 00:30:40,194
LIAM: (fart noise)

418
00:30:41,453 --> 00:30:47,836
BRIAN: However we did tease you with something
over the break. Le Chiffre, show it to me at once.

419
00:30:47,836 --> 00:30:50,004
We did tease you with something.

420
00:30:50,004 --> 00:30:52,413
(cheering and clapping)

421
00:30:54,421 --> 00:30:57,490
BRIAN: Put it back up! People don't want to see me
drink this!

422
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:59,313
LAURA: Oh my God! Do it again! Do it again!

423
00:30:59,313 --> 00:31:00,763
TRAVIS: Yeah, put it up! Show me those legs!

424
00:31:00,763 --> 00:31:03,689
(cheering and laughter)

425
00:31:09,498 --> 00:31:12,227
BRIAN: There is a lot going on there.

426
00:31:12,227 --> 00:31:13,667
MATT: Oh god.

427
00:31:13,667 --> 00:31:15,166
LAURA: Those glasses!

428
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:17,857
BRIAN: We got to it, didn't we?

429
00:31:17,857 --> 00:31:19,407
MARISHA: Oh, look at that, look at that!

430
00:31:19,407 --> 00:31:21,610
(laughter)

431
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:25,220
BRIAN: Oh, wow, what a great fade! Wow!

432
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:28,793
LAURA: That whole day it's like, "Are we in a
cult? Are we in a cult right now?"

433
00:31:28,793 --> 00:31:32,797
MATT: What's incredible is there are elements of
that image that aren't that different from my

434
00:31:32,797 --> 00:31:39,658
middle school photos I took. Man, I've always been
a winner.

435
00:31:39,658 --> 00:31:41,950
LAURA: I've seen that!

436
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:44,567
LAURA: Don't you have a picture of you on a
stairwell, or something?

437
00:31:44,567 --> 00:31:46,428
BRIAN: With a Hawaiian shirt on or something like
that?

438
00:31:46,428 --> 00:31:50,018
MATT: Oh yeah, I've got a bunch of pictures that
the world will never see.

439
00:31:50,018 --> 00:31:54,097
MARISHA: Yeah, I felt like the whole time we were
doing the photo shoot, because it was like a house

440
00:31:54,097 --> 00:31:58,408
in the Valley, I'm like, "Oh, they're going to
think this is the weirdest porn."

441
00:31:58,408 --> 00:32:01,123
(laughter)

442
00:32:01,123 --> 00:32:02,513
TRAVIS: The weirdest porn!

443
00:32:02,513 --> 00:32:04,383
MARISHA: Throwback!

444
00:32:05,743 --> 00:32:11,017
BRIAN: Yeah, the place where that photograph was
taken, you guys lucked out.

445
00:32:11,017 --> 00:32:13,316
LAURA: It was a great place.

446
00:32:13,316 --> 00:32:15,121
SAM: It was the only photograph taken there,
though.

447
00:32:15,121 --> 00:32:19,084
BRIAN: No, that was it! They came, they posed,
they went their separate ways.

448
00:32:19,084 --> 00:32:21,007
SAM: Yeah. It was about a five minute shoot.

449
00:32:21,007 --> 00:32:23,543
BRIAN: Well back to questions about the last
campaign.

450
00:32:23,543 --> 00:32:24,838
MATT: Yes.

451
00:32:24,838 --> 00:32:31,874
BRIAN: What? Oh, Chiffre's going to put something
else on the screen. Side by side! Let's do the

452
00:32:31,874 --> 00:32:37,802
look there. Do the face! There you go. Tilt the
head to your--There you go!

453
00:32:37,802 --> 00:32:40,763
ALL: Yeah!

454
00:32:42,774 --> 00:32:47,192
SAM: I love that we're comparing Matt to Matt two
months ago!

455
00:32:47,192 --> 00:32:49,494
BRIAN: Yeah, Matt two months ago and Matt now.

456
00:32:49,494 --> 00:32:52,474
MATT: Well this way you can tell just how much
weight I gained over the holidays.

457
00:32:52,474 --> 00:32:54,123
Direct comparison!

458
00:32:54,123 --> 00:33:01,848
BRIAN: Exactly. I know don't do a side by side of
any of us. Okay, back to questions about the last

459
00:33:01,848 --> 00:33:07,445
campaign. TiamatZX is back with a
eloquently-worded question for Matthew Mercer the

460
00:33:07,445 --> 00:33:12,835
Dungeon Master. "Percy had gotten two points of
corruption before having one reversed by Pike in

461
00:33:12,835 --> 00:33:16,184
‘Against the Tide of Bone,’" I guess that’s the
title of an episode?

462
00:33:16,184 --> 00:33:17,430
MATT: Yeah.

463
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:20,675
BRIAN: "What would’ve happened if he had gotten
more than two?"

464
00:33:20,675 --> 00:33:27,495
MATT: I had made a custom kind of 5e version of
the Corruption-- what were actually called the

465
00:33:27,495 --> 00:33:32,015
"Taint Rules" in the Heroes of Horror, but I
decided to change that because I knew, that this

466
00:33:32,015 --> 00:33:33,731
group would never fly.

467
00:33:33,731 --> 00:33:35,292
BRIAN: Stay taint!

468
00:33:36,853 --> 00:33:38,414
LIAM: You shouldn’t have said that shit now!

469
00:33:38,414 --> 00:33:40,267
(laughter)

470
00:33:41,489 --> 00:33:46,535
MATT: Yeah, but it’s from the Heroes of Horror
book for the older 3.5 D&D. I had used it for my

471
00:33:46,535 --> 00:33:53,076
Ravenloft game back in the day. I took all those
tables and I retooled them to Fifth Edition and

472
00:33:53,076 --> 00:34:00,028
simplified a bunch of it. Past two points was a
threshold where you get to more of a moderate

473
00:34:00,028 --> 00:34:05,137
severity of corruption, which you get a mental of
physical corruption. And so I’d roll--

474
00:34:05,137 --> 00:34:07,087
TRAVIS: A physical corruption on your taint?

475
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:11,715
MATT: Yes. See what I got to deal with every
week?

476
00:34:11,715 --> 00:34:13,367
TRAVIS: Listen!

477
00:34:13,367 --> 00:34:15,885
MATT: You’re making Purvan cry.

478
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,512
ALL: Aw.

479
00:34:17,512 --> 00:34:20,554
LIAM: Point of order! I believe the "Taint Rules"
apply in this situation!

480
00:34:20,554 --> 00:34:23,484
(laughter)

481
00:34:24,086 --> 00:34:26,843
BRIAN: I so bad wish I could read all those cry
babies on Reddit

482
00:34:26,843 --> 00:34:29,652
complaining about "Taint Rules" instead of--

483
00:34:29,652 --> 00:34:34,555
MATT: It would’ve been a physical or mental
corruption at that point, it would’ve been either

484
00:34:34,555 --> 00:34:41,762
a moderate insanity or a physical ailment like,
the eyes would’ve started to rot away, or he began

485
00:34:41,762 --> 00:34:48,059
to have the skin slough off a bit. Or he could’ve
began to have obsessive mental characteristics.

486
00:34:48,059 --> 00:34:50,288
TRAVIS: Bring it back, man, we can handle it, that
sounds awesome!

487
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:52,398
We’ll totally be grownups about it!

488
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:54,525
LAURA: No that is what it is! We’re just not going
to call it the "Taint Rules".

489
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:59,642
MATT: No! That’s the "Corruption Points" now.
Because it used to be divided. Like a lot of Third

490
00:34:59,642 --> 00:35:06,205
and 3.5 Edition rules, it was super complicated
when it didn’t really need to be so I pulled it

491
00:35:06,205 --> 00:35:11,050
back a bit. I was going to put them in the
Campaign Guide, but like I said, it was based on

492
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:14,794
the Heroes of Horror and it was too close to the
original settings. I may just release them online

493
00:35:14,794 --> 00:35:18,593
and if people want to give them a shot and, mess with them
them and retool them to yourself.

494
00:35:19,301 --> 00:35:22,201
BRIAN: Something tells me that people will be very
interested in that.

495
00:35:22,201 --> 00:35:24,450
MARISHA: We can’t even get through that question
without 30 jokes!

496
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:27,031
MATT: Yeah, I’m so excited for the new campaign!

497
00:35:27,031 --> 00:35:28,779
TRAVIS: All your hard work is extremely valued.

498
00:35:28,779 --> 00:35:30,579
(laughter)

499
00:35:30,579 --> 00:35:35,746
BRIAN: Liam, question from (gibberish). "Vax
originally planned to become a paladin of Sarenrae

500
00:35:35,746 --> 00:35:40,648
but was forced into the arrangement with the Raven
Queen. After meeting both, which goddess did he

501
00:35:40,648 --> 00:35:42,430
favor more in the end?"

502
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:43,466
LIAM: In the end?

503
00:35:43,466 --> 00:35:45,250
BRIAN: Yeah.

504
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:49,221
LIAM: (confused noises) I don’t know how to answer that.

505
00:35:49,221 --> 00:35:52,601
BRIAN: Well, as Kirk Douglas wouldn’t help us.

506
00:35:52,997 --> 00:35:57,381
TRAVIS: Go back to two episodes before the end,
and how did you feel?

507
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,900
LAURA: Just what does your gut say? Just answer!

508
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:08,952
LIAM: RQ, man, RQ let him be there at the end
there, at the end.

509
00:36:08,952 --> 00:36:10,711
TRAVIS: Good call, man.

510
00:36:10,711 --> 00:36:12,660
BRIAN: Yeah, that’s true. Sam.

511
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,052
SAM: Yes.

512
00:36:14,052 --> 00:36:18,748
BRIAN: TheHollyPhoenix would like to know: "Was
Scanlan really trying to learn what it’s like to

513
00:36:18,748 --> 00:36:23,711
be on drugs or was he just trying to find a way to
numb the pain of the whole Kaylie situation?"

514
00:36:23,711 --> 00:36:32,420
SAM: Hmm. I think he was the latter, numbing the
pain. He had some issues and was having a crisis

515
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,769
of conscience.

516
00:36:33,769 --> 00:36:35,209
LIAM: And taint points?

517
00:36:35,209 --> 00:36:36,547
SAM: Yeah, and he had--

518
00:36:36,547 --> 00:36:38,801
MATT: So much regret over here.

519
00:36:38,801 --> 00:36:41,427
SAM: He had some grundle issues.

520
00:36:41,427 --> 00:36:43,016
BRIAN: How do you think I feel?

521
00:36:43,016 --> 00:36:45,570
TRAVIS: This has been its infancy.

522
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,731
SAM: It’s "taint-ancy."

523
00:36:47,731 --> 00:36:50,300
TRAVIS: It’s a dwarf star, it’s about to-- A
supernova’s coming.

524
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:54,049
BRIAN: Liam’s had a month and a half to think of
stuff to yell at you right before we go live.

525
00:36:54,049 --> 00:36:57,511
MATT: You’ve never seen a faster TPK.

526
00:36:57,511 --> 00:37:02,024
BRIAN: Matt Colville, this’ll be his favorite
campaign: kill all the players before episode four.

527
00:37:03,611 --> 00:37:09,947
SAM: He was genuinely seeking a way out of his
distress. He didn't know who he was any more, what

528
00:37:09,947 --> 00:37:15,557
his purpose on the team was, or whether he should
be on the team or not.

529
00:37:15,557 --> 00:37:18,518
So he was looking for a way out.

530
00:37:18,518 --> 00:37:24,551
BRIAN: I had someone message me, I'm going to
share this because I died laughing. I had someone

531
00:37:24,551 --> 00:37:31,998
message me and say: "I know that Sam did the whole
Scanlan Drug Arc thing because that’s what he was

532
00:37:31,998 --> 00:37:37,372
dealing with in real life, but do you know if,
like whatever?" And I wrote back, and I was like:

533
00:37:37,372 --> 00:37:46,494
"HAHAHA" in all caps because I was like: "If you
knew Sam, where did you--" And he was like: "I

534
00:37:46,494 --> 00:37:50,476
just saw some people had said 'that's probably
whatever's going on.’"

535
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:53,193
SAM: I got in too deep?

536
00:37:53,193 --> 00:37:57,902
BRIAN: Yeah, you were in deep, man! You got in the
streets!

537
00:37:57,902 --> 00:38:01,187
MATT: A few weekends in Lancaster and you just
never were the same!

538
00:38:01,187 --> 00:38:06,132
SAM: Part of the reason I was late to so many of
the shows was I would come in with just gold spray

539
00:38:06,132 --> 00:38:16,400
paint. Then everyone would be like, "You have to
go clean up! Just say you were late or whatever!"

540
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,452
MATT: It was a very stressful period of the
campaign.

541
00:38:18,452 --> 00:38:21,866
BRIAN: It was, man. To think that so many laughs
came out of such heartbreak.

542
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:27,796
(laughter)

543
00:38:27,796 --> 00:38:36,059
BRIAN: Oh man, well, Taliesin. Run for sheriff of
Abilene with an answer to this question from

544
00:38:36,059 --> 00:38:37,753
Schneeland.

545
00:38:37,753 --> 00:38:40,392
SAM: The captain's uniform from Lufthansa Flight 91!

546
00:38:40,392 --> 00:38:43,111
(laughter)

547
00:38:43,111 --> 00:38:46,028
TALIESIN: Thank you! That’s what I was going for!

548
00:38:46,028 --> 00:38:51,590
BRIAN: Oh man. "In a way, Taliesin, Percy's greed
and carelessness in the sunken tomb were

549
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:56,590
responsible for Vax's ultimate departure. Does
this ever plague him?"

550
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:03,104
TALIESIN: I mean, it's a long list, and also, I
would disagree with greed.

551
00:39:03,104 --> 00:39:04,233
BRIAN: A long list of what?

552
00:39:04,233 --> 00:39:07,932
TALIESIN: It's a long list of things that he feels
responsible for, because he's the only adult in

553
00:39:07,932 --> 00:39:15,713
the entire world. It wasn't greed, it was just
hubris. Yeah, it was just hubris. He's a character

554
00:39:15,713 --> 00:39:22,452
based on hubris. People make that joke
occasionally, like immediately going into hell

555
00:39:22,452 --> 00:39:27,894
like "Okay, nobody ever make a deal, don't sign
anything," and then immediately within one hour is

556
00:39:27,894 --> 00:39:31,838
like "I'm going to to make a deal." Yeah, it's
because this is what you do when you tell all the

557
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:37,738
kids "Don't touch the oven!" This is my oven, I'm
going to cook something. It's what you do when you

558
00:39:37,738 --> 00:39:42,911
think you're the only adult in the entire world.
It always goes well.

559
00:39:42,911 --> 00:39:44,790
MATT and TALIESIN: As we've seen!

560
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:47,939
BRIAN: The way I used to see it was, "I was always
the kind of guy who would steal your drugs and

561
00:39:47,939 --> 00:39:49,727
then help you look for them."

562
00:39:49,727 --> 00:39:56,072
(laughter)

563
00:39:56,072 --> 00:40:01,449
BRIAN: "What man!? I'll be right over! I'll be
right over! I'm sure you left it in the can of

564
00:40:01,449 --> 00:40:13,603
Pringles." Laura, question from subokunotora.
Isn't that the thing-- no, that's-- did Vex know

565
00:40:13,603 --> 00:40:17,704
about Tary's feelings for Percy? If so, how did
that affect their friendship?

566
00:40:17,704 --> 00:40:18,605
TRAVIS: Seppuku.

567
00:40:18,605 --> 00:40:19,983
BRIAN: Thank you.

568
00:40:19,983 --> 00:40:23,507
LAURA: I was thinking sudoku.

569
00:40:23,507 --> 00:40:26,527
BRIAN: I was way off. Laura.

570
00:40:26,527 --> 00:40:34,484
LAURA: I don't think so? Did she know about-- no,
she didn't know about him. No.

571
00:40:34,484 --> 00:40:36,533
BRIAN: Okay. That wouldn't have been something
that was discussed.

572
00:40:36,533 --> 00:40:41,093
LAURA: Yeah, that was obviously, we talked about
that in our best friend hangouts.

573
00:40:41,093 --> 00:40:44,927
SAM: I'm sure you asked, but I don't know if he
was really into--

574
00:40:44,927 --> 00:40:46,904
LAURA: Like, who do you like right now?

575
00:40:46,904 --> 00:40:50,329
SAM: He was probably not in touch with his
emotions enough to even know.

576
00:40:50,329 --> 00:40:52,010
LAURA: Right.

577
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:53,943
SAM: Plus you talk a lot.

578
00:40:53,943 --> 00:40:57,314
LAURA: I did. I imagine that she did a lot of
talking.

579
00:40:57,314 --> 00:40:59,789
TRAVIS: That was a one-way street.

580
00:40:59,789 --> 00:41:01,372
BRIAN: He had to be a good listener.

581
00:41:01,372 --> 00:41:03,044
SAM: Just on and on.

582
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:06,957
TRAVIS: Did you know that-- and oh my god. Have
you heard?

583
00:41:06,957 --> 00:41:12,157
LAURA: I am so glad you're here because nobody
ever wants to hear these things.

584
00:41:12,157 --> 00:41:14,938
TRAVIS: I feel like you really understand me.

585
00:41:14,938 --> 00:41:19,576
BRIAN: Matt and Laura, this came from the
internet. Well, these all came from the goddamn--

586
00:41:19,576 --> 00:41:29,147
SamanthaXYZ-- We've been off for a few weeks. This
isn't a permanent situation. Matt and Laura, what

587
00:41:29,147 --> 00:41:33,670
would have happened if Vex would have said yes to
Saundor when she got her vestige?

588
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:36,349
MATT: Oh yeah, I think we mentioned that in one of
the Talks episodes.

589
00:41:36,349 --> 00:41:40,269
BRIAN: Dani said only one person asked that
question.

590
00:41:40,269 --> 00:41:49,586
MATT: The offer that would have come with your
character type going from humanoid to fey. You

591
00:41:49,586 --> 00:41:53,764
would have become a fey creature. The tree would
have embraced and pulled her up into the canopy

592
00:41:53,764 --> 00:41:56,074
and there would have been this transformation
process.

593
00:41:56,074 --> 00:41:57,581
BRIAN: A fey-ancé?

594
00:41:57,581 --> 00:41:59,578
ALL: Oh!

595
00:41:59,578 --> 00:42:05,657
BRIAN: This is why I write the show, folks. This
is why I alone write the popular program Critical

596
00:42:05,657 --> 00:42:06,885
Role.

597
00:42:06,885 --> 00:42:08,985
LAURA: Now I am regretting not saying yes.

598
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:11,798
MATT: You would have transitioned to a fey
creature and some of the racial benefits would

599
00:42:11,798 --> 00:42:13,009
have come with that.

600
00:42:13,009 --> 00:42:14,314
LAURA: But then, some of the downsides, too.

601
00:42:14,314 --> 00:42:18,205
MATT: Well, some of the benefits would have been
like a perpetual bark skin. You would have had

602
00:42:18,205 --> 00:42:22,518
other fey abilities would have come to you, but
you also would have gotten vulnerability to fire

603
00:42:22,518 --> 00:42:23,778
damage.

604
00:42:23,778 --> 00:42:25,275
LAURA: Which would have been real bad.

605
00:42:25,275 --> 00:42:27,044
MATT: Especially in the later battles.

606
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:30,000
LAURA: Yeah. I would have been dead fighting
Thordak.

607
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,823
There's no way I would have survived those.

608
00:42:31,823 --> 00:42:34,302
MATT: And then you would have been bound to
Saundor, in which case he would have become a

609
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:39,907
patron for the remainder of the campaign to you,
or until you rebelled, in which case that would

610
00:42:39,907 --> 00:42:41,685
have gone-- I don't know where that would have gone.

611
00:42:41,685 --> 00:42:42,810
LAURA: Super south.

612
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:47,212
MATT: Probably pretty bad. But yeah, you would
have bound yourself to a not-so-good person.

613
00:42:47,212 --> 00:42:51,198
LAURA: Yeah, but I would have gotten some sweet
tree loving.

614
00:42:51,198 --> 00:42:55,153
MARISHA: Yeah, you would have had those nice curvy
tree hips. Yeah.

615
00:42:55,153 --> 00:42:57,315
TRAVIS: Sweet tree loving?

616
00:42:57,315 --> 00:42:59,103
LAURA: Saundor. I would have gotten some Saundor loving.

617
00:42:59,103 --> 00:43:05,357
BRIAN: May be a better way to word it. I picture
some bad things happening with those trees from

618
00:43:05,357 --> 00:43:08,205
the second Lord of the Rings. Travis--

619
00:43:08,205 --> 00:43:10,364
LAURA: Ooh, there's got to be some fanfic online.

620
00:43:10,364 --> 00:43:11,619
BRIAN: There is.

621
00:43:11,619 --> 00:43:13,395
LAURA: Some ent fic? Yeah.

622
00:43:13,395 --> 00:43:15,965
MATT: Guess what we're googling at break.

623
00:43:15,965 --> 00:43:19,246
BRIAN: Yep. Not going to be a break, unless you want one.

624
00:43:19,246 --> 00:43:20,444
MATT: Oh, no. Keep going.

625
00:43:20,444 --> 00:43:21,976
BRIAN: Do you want a break?

626
00:43:21,976 --> 00:43:24,304
TALIESIN: That'll be the 90 minutes after this 90
minutes.

627
00:43:24,304 --> 00:43:29,583
BRIAN: Travis. Cardamonelaw wants to know, "What
was Grog's-- character you played in the last

628
00:43:29,583 --> 00:43:32,546
campaign-- fascination with the lycans about? Was
he just wanting to tap more into his primal

629
00:43:32,546 --> 00:43:33,854
side?"

630
00:43:33,854 --> 00:43:34,969
TRAVIS: What was the--?

631
00:43:34,969 --> 00:43:36,427
BRIAN: Fascination with the lycans?

632
00:43:36,427 --> 00:43:42,456
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah. I think he just-- what was the
name of the big alpha lycan?

633
00:43:42,456 --> 00:43:44,010
MATT: Oh, in the Feywild.

634
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:45,428
TRAVIS: Ukurat?

635
00:43:45,428 --> 00:43:46,759
MARISHA: Ulrich?

636
00:43:46,759 --> 00:43:48,674
MATT: No, not Ulrich. I can't remember off the top
of my head.

637
00:43:48,674 --> 00:43:55,728
TRAVIS: Yeah, I can't. He was really in the face
of Scanlan right when he got there and Grog took

638
00:43:55,728 --> 00:44:01,541
issue with that, and so I wanted to pick a fight,
but I was trying not to blow up too fast and get

639
00:44:01,541 --> 00:44:08,066
us all into trouble, and then I got petrified by a
bunch of faeries. So that didn't go well. But

640
00:44:08,066 --> 00:44:14,068
after that, I think Grog just realized that there
was maybe more to tap into,

641
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:16,467
plus Travis loves werewolves.

642
00:44:16,467 --> 00:44:19,206
LAURA: Yeah. I was going to ask, when are you
going to say that part?

643
00:44:19,206 --> 00:44:22,486
LIAM: That was my follow-up question. What
percentage is Travis and what percentage is Grog?

644
00:44:22,486 --> 00:44:26,624
TRAVIS: Oh, it was 99% Travis wanting to get
werewolf art of Grog.

645
00:44:26,624 --> 00:44:29,834
MATT: So internet, make that happen.

646
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:32,714
LAURA: Yeah, did that ever happen? Did you ever
get werewolf Grog?

647
00:44:32,714 --> 00:44:37,817
TRAVIS: Yeah. I saw it. I saw some stuff. I even
got some minis while we were in-- I got three

648
00:44:37,817 --> 00:44:39,732
werewolf minis in Australia.

649
00:44:39,732 --> 00:44:41,069
LAURA: That's right. I remember that.

650
00:44:41,069 --> 00:44:45,992
SAM: Speaking of petrified, how many fights were
you in as Grog where you were totally taken out of

651
00:44:45,992 --> 00:44:53,396
the fight by being bamfed away, frozen solid,
killed instantly, turned into a dummy,

652
00:44:53,396 --> 00:44:56,677
turned against us?

653
00:44:56,677 --> 00:44:58,600
BRIAN: Check CritRoleStats later and see if that's
a thing.

654
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,147
SAM: It's got to be half, right?

655
00:45:00,147 --> 00:45:02,436
MATT: Oh, it's not half by any means.

656
00:45:02,436 --> 00:45:05,035
LIAM: No, but it's the only way for the DM to get
at him.

657
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:07,676
MATT: Well, it depends on what you're fighting. If
it's an intelligent creature, it knows what the

658
00:45:07,676 --> 00:45:12,904
biggest threat is, the seven-foot, eight-foot guy
with the giant axe who looks like he could take

659
00:45:12,904 --> 00:45:16,620
anything you throw at him. I'm not even going to
damage him, just (pop). Get out of the fight.

660
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:18,304
TRAVIS: Okay, bye!

661
00:45:18,304 --> 00:45:27,337
MARISHA: You got grappled in that, not Kevdak, the
beholder.

662
00:45:27,337 --> 00:45:28,476
LAURA: K'varn?

663
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:29,702
MARISHA: K'varn, thank you.

664
00:45:29,702 --> 00:45:31,313
SAM: Yeah, in a holding cell or something?

665
00:45:31,313 --> 00:45:32,853
MARISHA: Yeah, you got stuck for most of it?

666
00:45:32,853 --> 00:45:34,461
LAURA: The mime box.

667
00:45:34,461 --> 00:45:38,591
MATT: It depends on who you're fighting. A lot of
things that are not very intelligent will still go

668
00:45:38,591 --> 00:45:41,417
after Grog and be like, "Ugh, he's just not going
down!"

669
00:45:41,417 --> 00:45:45,582
LIAM: Wasn't he also grappled by something in the
fight with the elder brain? Like you got too close

670
00:45:45,582 --> 00:45:47,565
to a cage and got snagged by something in the
cage?

671
00:45:47,565 --> 00:45:49,037
LAURA: That's what he was talking about.

672
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:50,496
LIAM: Oh, that's K'varn?

673
00:45:50,496 --> 00:45:52,970
MATT: Yeah, there were two of K'varn's experiments
in cages. Anyone got close, they would just

674
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:54,932
grapple and hold them to the cage.

675
00:45:54,932 --> 00:45:57,907
TRAVIS: I had to be all curious and see what was
in there. I was like, "Ooh, allies! (clang)

676
00:45:57,907 --> 00:46:00,564
(groan) Help!" Then I got stuck there forever.

677
00:46:00,564 --> 00:46:05,627
MARISHA: You were just rolling so bad. I remember
that. Should have broken out, man.

678
00:46:05,627 --> 00:46:07,866
LAURA: You were just rolling so bad.

679
00:46:07,866 --> 00:46:13,077
TRAVIS: We were really good at strategy at that
point. We were the Avengers on point.

680
00:46:13,077 --> 00:46:14,807
LAURA: No, that was some good strategy in that fight.

681
00:46:14,807 --> 00:46:16,368
TRAVIS: We got fucking lucky.

682
00:46:16,368 --> 00:46:20,677
SAM: We got worse at strategy as we went.

683
00:46:20,677 --> 00:46:23,447
LIAM: But this is the year that we reclaim dignity!

684
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,977
(laughter)

685
00:46:25,977 --> 00:46:27,615
TRAVIS: Gif that.

686
00:46:27,615 --> 00:46:32,037
BRIAN: Says the guy who yells out taint whistle
three seconds before we go live.

687
00:46:32,037 --> 00:46:34,438
LAURA: Hey, that's going to be the first one.

688
00:46:34,438 --> 00:46:38,727
BRIAN: Matt, we had to mine really deep for
questions for this thing, you know, when we did

689
00:46:38,727 --> 00:46:45,947
the original thing, and I found a gem-- and by I,
I mean Dani-- found a gem only asked by

690
00:46:45,947 --> 00:46:49,722
TheHollyPhoenix. What does the Moon Hammer do?

691
00:46:49,722 --> 00:46:51,883
MATT: Oh, right!

692
00:46:51,883 --> 00:46:59,841
BRIAN: Literally 10,000 people show up at my house
asking me about the goddamn Moon Hammer.

693
00:46:59,841 --> 00:47:02,229
TRAVIS: Mary gave me a Moon Hammer.

694
00:47:02,229 --> 00:47:03,150
SAM: Did you use it?

695
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:04,590
LAURA: He never used it.

696
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:09,097
TRAVIS: No. Well, it had to be used under the
moon, apparently, but we rarely fought under

697
00:47:09,097 --> 00:47:12,378
moonlight. But I don't know what it did.

698
00:47:12,378 --> 00:47:14,371
LIAM: It's a plus one hammer.

699
00:47:14,371 --> 00:47:19,216
MATT: Well, naturally, it was a plus one hammer,
and then when you brought it under full moonlight,

700
00:47:19,216 --> 00:47:24,194
it would empower the hammer. What it would do is
it would give it a charge that would allow you to

701
00:47:24,194 --> 00:47:29,328
cast Improved Invisibility on yourself or another
target until it was charged again. It wasn't some

702
00:47:29,328 --> 00:47:31,417
grandiose powerful item.

703
00:47:31,417 --> 00:47:32,867
TRAVIS: It didn't turn me into a werewolf?

704
00:47:32,867 --> 00:47:36,776
MATT: No. That would have been cool, but it didn't
make sense for what Zahra's--

705
00:47:36,776 --> 00:47:43,480
TRAVIS: I would have ripped my clothes off and run
out of this studio right now. I would have beat

706
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:47,679
myself to death during the rest of the stream if
that was true.

707
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:52,778
MATT: Zahra's enchantment capabilities weren't
super powerful, so she can craft something that

708
00:47:52,778 --> 00:47:55,518
was somewhat useful given the circumstance.

709
00:47:55,518 --> 00:47:57,674
LAURA: Probably at this point, she'd be able to do
some pretty badass--

710
00:47:57,674 --> 00:48:02,671
MATT: By now, yeah. But at the time, limited to
enchanting something with a one charge Improved

711
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:04,169
Invisibility.

712
00:48:04,169 --> 00:48:07,242
TRAVIS: Improved Invisibility is not bad. I never
went invisible.

713
00:48:07,242 --> 00:48:10,054
MATT: No, especially if you could use it as a
person who was not a spellcaster. That was the

714
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:14,484
benefit of it. Anybody was attuned to the weapon
could then use it until it was recharged again.

715
00:48:14,484 --> 00:48:16,908
TRAVIS: Grog would have forgotten he was
invisible. It's okay.

716
00:48:16,908 --> 00:48:19,080
LAURA: Yeah, the minute you attack, you would have
been visible again.

717
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:22,167
TRAVIS: (yells) Aww.

718
00:48:22,167 --> 00:48:28,456
BRIAN: Matt, OnceUponAPun wants to know, speaking
of interesting items, where and when did Sylas

719
00:48:28,456 --> 00:48:31,736
come into possession of Craven Edge?

720
00:48:32,053 --> 00:48:40,071
MATT: Craven Edge would have been probably one of
the artifacts that the cult of the Whispered One

721
00:48:40,071 --> 00:48:47,965
had amassed. Even while Vecna was scattered
amongst the planes and trying to coalesce over

722
00:48:47,965 --> 00:48:53,402
time, those who followed him, all the various
Remnants that were out there in the world were

723
00:48:53,402 --> 00:48:56,566
collecting things for when he returned. There were
all sorts of artifacts and items that they were

724
00:48:56,566 --> 00:49:01,603
pooling in places where they had the most
influence. Craven Edge was one of the most

725
00:49:01,603 --> 00:49:05,697
powerful artifacts that they had recovered. When
he brought Sylas back and the Briarwoods had

726
00:49:05,697 --> 00:49:14,972
proven that they were dependable right-hand men to
Vecna, he went, "All right, you can use this, and

727
00:49:14,972 --> 00:49:20,360
since you are undead by nature and I was
responsible for your resurrection, Sylas, you

728
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:25,859
could ignore some of the penalties of this item."

729
00:49:25,859 --> 00:49:29,100
TRAVIS: The dying part?

730
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:35,041
MATT: Yeah, it would have been harder for that to
happen to him. So it was just amassed by the

731
00:49:35,041 --> 00:49:40,474
Remnants then gifted to Sylas when he became one
of the higher-ups within that structure.

732
00:49:41,014 --> 00:49:48,874
TRAVIS: Was Grog the only one to take Craven Edge
to the limit? To its max anime status? Did he take

733
00:49:48,874 --> 00:49:53,044
him to the ten? Give it to him?

734
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:56,587
TALIESIN: You maxed out the taint bar, man.

735
00:49:56,587 --> 00:50:00,423
MATT: There may have been a handful of other ones
that had bankai-ed in the past, but you were the

736
00:50:00,423 --> 00:50:02,663
only one in recent centuries.

737
00:50:02,663 --> 00:50:06,589
TRAVIS: Fair enough. Recent centuries is pretty
good.

738
00:50:06,589 --> 00:50:09,041
MARISHA: Good thing Pike was there.

739
00:50:09,041 --> 00:50:12,899
LIAM: I wonder what Sylas' toilet chats were like?

740
00:50:13,224 --> 00:50:16,562
MATT: Nowhere near as interesting. They actually
probably had good debates and

741
00:50:16,562 --> 00:50:18,507
philosophical discussions.

742
00:50:18,507 --> 00:50:21,523
LIAM: Does Sylas Briarwood even take a shit?

743
00:50:21,523 --> 00:50:23,465
MATT: You know, that's a good question.

744
00:50:23,465 --> 00:50:26,315
LAURA: Is it just blood poop?

745
00:50:26,315 --> 00:50:30,289
SAM: Matt doesn't want to reveal anything that
might come into play in the next campaign.

746
00:50:30,289 --> 00:50:37,114
BRIAN: Yeah guys, a couple of things he keeps
really close to the chest just in case Sylas poop

747
00:50:37,114 --> 00:50:39,358
was something we talked about.

748
00:50:39,358 --> 00:50:42,181
MATT: There are some great DM's Guild things I am
working on in the future around that so I don't

749
00:50:42,181 --> 00:50:43,970
want to spoil anything.

750
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:49,515
BRIAN: Sam and Matt, was there any discussion
about how Doty was built? I know that got asked

751
00:50:49,515 --> 00:50:51,255
about a lot.

752
00:50:51,255 --> 00:50:58,640
SAM: How it was built? It was part of the
artificer class to have a-- something.

753
00:50:59,381 --> 00:51:02,625
MATT: A mechanical automaton that would be his
companion.

754
00:51:02,625 --> 00:51:08,725
SAM: Before I knew that and before he proposed the
class to me, artificer, because i didn't know what

755
00:51:08,725 --> 00:51:15,334
it was, I had proposed to him a rich guy who
travels around with a biographer, who buys all of

756
00:51:15,334 --> 00:51:22,706
his gear and has no actual skill. And he was like
"I've got it, artificer and you have a robot

757
00:51:22,706 --> 00:51:26,705
assistant." I was like "Can he write?" and he was
like "Yep, done!"

758
00:51:26,705 --> 00:51:31,187
MATT: Yeah it was a perfect union. The more you
told me about the character, I was like "Oh, well

759
00:51:31,187 --> 00:51:34,278
this just came out very recently on Unearthed
Arcana."

760
00:51:34,278 --> 00:51:35,009
SAM: Yeah.

761
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:35,953
MATT: It worked out great.

762
00:51:35,953 --> 00:51:42,333
SAM. Yeah, it worked out great. I don't know about
that class so much. It seemed like it peaked. I

763
00:51:42,333 --> 00:51:44,154
don't know how much--

764
00:51:44,154 --> 00:51:49,930
MATT: It's in the testing phase. It definitely
isn't a powerful class it is a utility,

765
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:53,459
interesting class. I can see certain builds that
would be powerful but--

766
00:51:53,459 --> 00:51:55,120
LAURA: I guess a support.

767
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:58,974
MATT: Yeah, a support and toolbox type class.

768
00:51:58,974 --> 00:52:04,904
MARISHA: Your crown jewels saved me when I jumped
off a cliff. That was great.

769
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:11,821
LIAM: Story-wise, when he was a strapping young
buck, was he taking physics and engineering

770
00:52:11,821 --> 00:52:13,472
classes, tutors?

771
00:52:13,472 --> 00:52:14,756
SAM: Sure, yeah, tutors.

772
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:17,951
LIAM: Was it Lawrence who taught him how to make
Doty?

773
00:52:17,951 --> 00:52:21,052
SAM: I don't know what Lawrence taught him. I
actually thought that Lawrence was more of a

774
00:52:21,052 --> 00:52:30,765
literature tutor of romance languages or whatever.
But he definitely had all the best tutors.

775
00:52:34,043 --> 00:52:37,767
BRIAN: Who do I want to talk to more in this
moment? Matt.

776
00:52:37,767 --> 00:52:39,410
LIAM: Ashley is not here Brian.

777
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:45,687
BRIAN: I know. Erin Bradshaw wants to know, "What
were the plans of the illithid after Vox Machina's

778
00:52:45,687 --> 00:52:52,301
escape? Would they/did they consider taking over
Kraghammer?"

779
00:52:52,301 --> 00:53:01,152
MATT: The illithid rarely want to get closer to
the surface. They prefer to bring things to them.

780
00:53:01,152 --> 00:53:09,837
They expand slowly from an inside standpoint.
Conquering a location isn't as important as

781
00:53:09,837 --> 00:53:14,923
building up power to base and then possibly
jumping to a new plane or a new society. They are

782
00:53:14,923 --> 00:53:24,333
one of those weird, alien colonization-type
species that jump between worlds. The Far Realm

783
00:53:24,333 --> 00:53:27,165
gets real interesting, folks.

784
00:53:27,165 --> 00:53:32,028
LIAM: And all underground when they dimension
shift it's just beehives under the earth.

785
00:53:32,028 --> 00:53:38,019
MATT: For the most part. It depends on where
they're going. They're all about enslavement and

786
00:53:38,019 --> 00:53:43,714
mind-control and fleeing their hunters, which are
like the githyanki. There are other species out

787
00:53:43,714 --> 00:53:48,884
there that are constantly hunting and trying to
eradicate them. So they have this combination of

788
00:53:49,203 --> 00:53:54,578
wanting to be as unseen as possible and then
drawing things into their fold and controlling

789
00:53:54,578 --> 00:54:01,131
them. Probably, they were pulling things that got
too close, maybe eventually if Kraghammer became a

790
00:54:01,131 --> 00:54:06,475
huge issue they would maybe core it out and
destroy the people and then leave the ruins, but I

791
00:54:06,475 --> 00:54:10,822
don't see them hanging as close to the surface as
Kraghammer was.

792
00:54:10,822 --> 00:54:13,723
LAURA: Just like, making some bedrooms in there
and summer homes.

793
00:54:13,723 --> 00:54:17,841
MATT: Yeah, with some nice shawls or sweaters.

794
00:54:17,841 --> 00:54:21,810
BRIAN: I don't understand why my friends who don't
watch Critical Role, that tune into this, say that

795
00:54:21,810 --> 00:54:32,663
they are confused. With answers like that.
Question for everybody from Myurnaoneshot-- it's

796
00:54:32,663 --> 00:54:37,646
as close as we are going to get gang. "What
happens with the Slayer's Cake? Does Vox Machina

797
00:54:37,646 --> 00:54:40,197
stay involved with it?"

798
00:54:40,197 --> 00:54:41,707
MARISHA: We loosely talked about this?

799
00:54:41,707 --> 00:54:43,846
LAURA: Yeah. I think they opened up chains.

800
00:54:43,846 --> 00:54:49,984
MARISHA: Yeah, we said they franchised it. The
next place would be Emon.

801
00:54:49,984 --> 00:54:51,282
LAURA: Yeah.

802
00:54:51,282 --> 00:54:52,935
SAM: They'd release a cookbook.

803
00:54:52,935 --> 00:54:56,035
LAURA: Eventually an Ank'Harel location.

804
00:54:56,035 --> 00:54:57,445
MARISHA: 100%.

805
00:54:57,445 --> 00:55:00,273
TALIESIN: Eventually, there's like two a block.
You can't escape them.

806
00:55:00,273 --> 00:55:06,996
SAM: They have a low price point option. SC2.

807
00:55:06,996 --> 00:55:12,150
MARISHA: Well, part of my Honey Heist game, that
was part of the whole easter egg because it was a

808
00:55:12,395 --> 00:55:18,693
year or two after everything had closed. I don't
think we ever actually got into this. Part of the

809
00:55:18,693 --> 00:55:26,575
prize for winning the honey contest was that you'd
be able to sell your baked goods and your honey

810
00:55:26,575 --> 00:55:35,168
tax-free. Remember Vex being like "We have to go
win this shit, and then open up our next chain--"

811
00:55:35,168 --> 00:55:36,623
LAURA: Tax-free!

812
00:55:36,623 --> 00:55:41,509
MARISHA: Yeah, in Westruun. I think, in my head,
we were trying to start making a name for

813
00:55:41,509 --> 00:55:45,156
ourselves as the Slayer's Cake in Westruun.

814
00:55:45,156 --> 00:55:46,476
BRIAN: Wow, that's pretty awesome.

815
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:49,895
LAURA: Plus, think about it. They're friends with
Gilmore, so he's telling them how to do stuff,

816
00:55:49,895 --> 00:55:51,785
they got to like--

817
00:55:51,785 --> 00:55:55,875
LIAM: Every Gilmore's Glorious Goods should have a
little Slayer's Cake inside it.

818
00:55:55,875 --> 00:55:57,869
LAURA: Like Barnes & Noble with a coffee shop!

819
00:55:57,869 --> 00:55:58,978
MARISHA: Oh my--

820
00:55:58,978 --> 00:56:01,512
MARISHA and LAURA: (yelling) That's what happened!

821
00:56:01,512 --> 00:56:03,579
LAURA: That's canon.

822
00:56:03,579 --> 00:56:06,726
BRIAN: Speaking of Gilmore, and his glorious goods--

823
00:56:06,726 --> 00:56:10,290
MATT: (as Gilmore) Yes, you rang?

824
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:14,802
BRIAN: People want to know, especially The Florist
Friar, what a great name, "How did Gilmore react

825
00:56:14,802 --> 00:56:16,849
to Vax's death?"

826
00:56:16,849 --> 00:56:21,061
MATT: Oh, terribly! He was heartbroken, just because--

827
00:56:21,367 --> 00:56:24,265
BRIAN: I was so hoping you were going to say he
went, "Who?"

828
00:56:24,265 --> 00:56:27,107
(laughter)

829
00:56:27,707 --> 00:56:32,179
MATT: Even though long-term things didn't pan out
for them, he still cherishes the time they did

830
00:56:32,179 --> 00:56:37,002
have, and the friendship he forged thereafter,
with everybody, so he's heartbroken for both his

831
00:56:37,002 --> 00:56:42,658
connection with Vax, and for the rest of Vox
Machina and other people whose lives he'd come in

832
00:56:42,658 --> 00:56:52,969
contact with. He's very thankful for the time he
had. The whole post-campaign for Gilmore was a lot

833
00:56:52,969 --> 00:56:58,727
of self-reflection. He was very much this
self-started, wanting to prove to the world that

834
00:56:58,727 --> 00:57:04,197
he can succeed and be as good as he can, and had
these dreams of perpetual expansion and

835
00:57:04,197 --> 00:57:10,583
franchising. He backed off that a little bit after
all the events of the campaign, and just focused

836
00:57:10,583 --> 00:57:13,913
on small local shops and staying on Tal'Dorei.

837
00:57:13,913 --> 00:57:15,129
LAURA: You're screwing up our Slayer's Cake.

838
00:57:15,129 --> 00:57:16,327
MATT: I'm sorry!

839
00:57:16,327 --> 00:57:17,998
MARISHA: It doesn't work anymore.

840
00:57:17,998 --> 00:57:20,831
MATT: Well no, he's an expansion of your
territory, you guys can go wherever you want!

841
00:57:20,831 --> 00:57:23,154
BRIAN: After he got famous from that meme it all
went--

842
00:57:23,154 --> 00:57:24,200
MATT: Yeah, exactly.

843
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:27,943
(laughter)

844
00:57:27,943 --> 00:57:30,008
MATT: Enchanter bae.

845
00:57:30,543 --> 00:57:33,540
BRIAN: Yeah, after he got famous from that he did
his own thing.

846
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:38,860
MATT: I think Vax's death and the whole events
there, especially in the tower at the end-- a lot

847
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:43,088
of self-reflection, a lot of showing more
appreciation to Sherri and the people that helped

848
00:57:43,088 --> 00:57:46,839
him build what it was, and talking to his parents
more often.

849
00:57:46,839 --> 00:57:48,924
LAURA: Yeah, that's great.

850
00:57:48,924 --> 00:57:52,508
BRIAN: Liam, how does his sentiment about that
nonexistent person resonate with your sentiments

851
00:57:52,508 --> 00:57:56,574
about your own nonexistent person?

852
00:57:56,574 --> 00:58:01,220
LIAM: Oh man, tainted love is a complicated
thing.

853
00:58:03,167 --> 00:58:10,058
BRIAN: Just to remind people out there these are
fictional characters. Despite how close you might

854
00:58:10,058 --> 00:58:11,231
get to them.

855
00:58:11,231 --> 00:58:14,333
MATT: It's just fictional from your standpoint,
man. It's been our life for three years.

856
00:58:14,333 --> 00:58:19,383
BRIAN: I just mean when I get death threats
because I didn't ask enough questions about

857
00:58:19,383 --> 00:58:25,732
Gilmore, he's not real. What is real is your lack
of life.

858
00:58:25,732 --> 00:58:27,398
ALL: Aww.

859
00:58:27,398 --> 00:58:34,591
BRIAN: I'm just kidding! I plan to read a list of
screen names at the end of it. Your reaction.

860
00:58:34,591 --> 00:58:42,010
LIAM: (sighs) I mean he feels guilty about leaving
everybody. He didn't regret anything he did in his

861
00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:48,479
life that was stupid and there was so much. But
leaving people behind were his biggest regrets.

862
00:58:48,479 --> 00:58:53,360
For a long time, and I said this at some point
like six months ago, that his biggest regret was

863
00:58:53,360 --> 00:59:02,152
disappointing Gilmore. That was eclipsed by
disappointing Keyleth, and leaving the family. But

864
00:59:02,152 --> 00:59:11,099
Gilmore is a huge thing for me, Liam. I mean, I
kissed guys in college. You think I'm pulling this

865
00:59:11,099 --> 00:59:13,258
out of thin air?

866
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:14,498
SAM: College?

867
00:59:14,498 --> 00:59:16,022
LIAM: Come here, baby.

868
00:59:16,022 --> 00:59:18,909
(laughter)

869
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:27,159
BRIAN: Sam was immediately hurt! I saw anger,
hurt--

870
00:59:27,159 --> 00:59:30,169
SAM: Give me his name, and where does he live!? I
will burn his house down!

871
00:59:30,169 --> 00:59:32,961
LIAM: His name was Kevin Harris, it was on the--

872
00:59:32,961 --> 00:59:35,497
SAM: Did you like it?

873
00:59:35,497 --> 00:59:38,035
LIAM: A little bit!

874
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:41,920
BRIAN: "I kissed guys in college" he says.

875
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:45,070
TRAVIS: Did you kiss him? Or did he kiss you?

876
00:59:46,091 --> 00:59:48,719
SAM: Do you follow him on Facebook?

877
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:51,772
TRAVIS: Did you kiss him back?

878
00:59:51,772 --> 00:59:57,593
LIAM: Gilmore was one of many things that was like
a huge, blessing and surprise, that I had no idea

879
00:59:57,593 --> 01:00:05,455
that Dungeons and fucking Dragons would give to
me. And I loved that I had that story with Matt.

880
01:00:05,455 --> 01:00:12,145
BRIAN: Like we talked about last time. Nobody even
expected him to become probably the most beloved

881
01:00:12,145 --> 01:00:16,868
of all the NPCs or that he would play such a huge
role in campaign. At all.

882
01:00:16,868 --> 01:00:21,739
LIAM: How many games did we have at home total?
Eleven? Fifteen?

883
01:00:21,739 --> 01:00:22,780
MATT: Seventeen.

884
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:26,424
LIAM: Seventeen? Gilmore was not in the majority
of those. It was the minority, right?

885
01:00:26,424 --> 01:00:27,819
MATT: I think he was in two sessions.

886
01:00:27,819 --> 01:00:28,880
LAURA: That's it?

887
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:32,469
MATT: The one where you met him and the one where
you guys made the deal that he would sponsor you

888
01:00:32,469 --> 01:00:33,692
guys' adventures.

889
01:00:33,692 --> 01:00:37,720
LIAM: But he was super memorable and we loved our
encounters with him, but it wasn't a lot. And then

890
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:43,261
we're like, "Oh, we hope this NPC that we thought
was so entertaining and so amazing will show up in

891
01:00:43,261 --> 01:00:48,960
the game." And then it evolved rapidly. Again, it
just comes from us doing it every week instead of

892
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,990
every week instead of every six weeks.

893
01:00:50,990 --> 01:00:54,089
LAURA: We shouldn't have eaten all of those beans
and stuff before this.

894
01:00:54,089 --> 01:00:56,101
TRAVIS: Are you saying that I shouldn't have eaten
all those beans?

895
01:00:56,101 --> 01:00:59,069
LAURA: No, because that's what there was to eat
right? It was beans.

896
01:00:59,069 --> 01:01:03,941
MATT: It was seventeen home sessions, but the home
sessions were like six to ten hours. They were

897
01:01:03,941 --> 01:01:05,759
super long home sessions.

898
01:01:05,759 --> 01:01:09,786
BRIAN: But I'm thinking about the home game that
I'm doing with Mary and Steve and everybody and

899
01:01:09,786 --> 01:01:16,833
we're coming up on almost that number. And to
think of having to go weekly, online, playing in

900
01:01:16,833 --> 01:01:22,230
front of like-- fuck no! That’s terrifying to
think about.

901
01:01:22,230 --> 01:01:24,400
LAURA: I don't feel like your sessions are as long
as our were, right?

902
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:25,872
BRIAN: Some of them can be.

903
01:01:25,872 --> 01:01:27,441
LAURA: Because we went like twelve hours.

904
01:01:27,441 --> 01:01:30,996
BRIAN: If I drink, and then the dice fall of the
table, and I have to reroll.

905
01:01:30,996 --> 01:01:33,480
LAURA: Brother, we had a twelve hour game.

906
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:36,081
MARISHA: Yeah, we got there at like ten and we
went until like ten.

907
01:01:36,081 --> 01:01:39,150
LIAM: That feels right as well, like all day feels right.

908
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:43,801
BRIAN: Yeah we do like the big Sunday ones now
where we drink mimosas. Yeah. Mary's usually

909
01:01:43,801 --> 01:01:47,640
throwing up by 10:00AM. But that's just Saturday.
To be honest.

910
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:50,778
MATT: Yeah, like I grew with that shit. We'd do
long weekends planned out where we'd go to a

911
01:01:50,778 --> 01:01:53,697
friend’s house and we'd game all Saturday,
sleepover, and game all day Sunday.

912
01:01:53,697 --> 01:01:55,760
It was amazing.

913
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:56,862
LAURA: That sounds amazing!

914
01:01:56,862 --> 01:01:58,030
MATT: I miss those days.

915
01:01:58,030 --> 01:01:59,624
LIAM, LAURA, and MARISHA: Big bear!

916
01:01:59,624 --> 01:02:03,199
LIAM: You used to also have to corral us every
game too. For like the first hour, it would be

917
01:02:03,199 --> 01:02:06,321
like "Ah!" And we would be catching up and
drinking mimosas. And you'd be like--

918
01:02:06,321 --> 01:02:10,566
MATT: All right, guys, we’ve got to play. Get back
to the table.

919
01:02:10,566 --> 01:02:14,932
BRIAN: Now we see each other so often it's like,
"So what have you been doing since 2:00PM?"

920
01:02:14,932 --> 01:02:16,904
(laughter)

921
01:02:16,904 --> 01:02:21,220
MARISHA: How was your shower and walking the dogs?
That was good? Okay, cool.

922
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:29,301
BRIAN: Matt, Mike Mahathy wants to know-- Don't
laugh, it makes me laugh Travis. "Who was the

923
01:02:29,301 --> 01:02:33,941
mystery person who contracted the Clasp to abduct Vex?"

924
01:02:33,941 --> 01:02:36,902
MATT: Oh yeah!

925
01:02:36,902 --> 01:02:38,535
LAURA: Did we ever talk about this yet?

926
01:02:38,535 --> 01:02:39,784
LIAM: Steve Bannon.

927
01:02:39,784 --> 01:02:46,527
MATT: (laughs) Kind of. Well, there was an
individual. I didn't have to develop it too far

928
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:54,741
because you guys didn't go too deep into that plot
thread. But it was like a lower noble in Westruun

929
01:02:54,741 --> 01:03:02,487
who, just in passing, had a run-in with Vex, and
she totally blew him off in a very Vex fashion.

930
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:07,401
And he kind of developed this obsession with her.
And so he would try to find information, send

931
01:03:07,401 --> 01:03:09,846
people to follow her. It was really a weird,
fucked up--

932
01:03:09,846 --> 01:03:11,401
LAURA: It happens all the time, actually.

933
01:03:11,401 --> 01:03:13,202
MATT: Yeah. And so the story with that was--

934
01:03:13,202 --> 01:03:15,241
MARISHA: (as Vex) I'm such a hazard.

935
01:03:15,241 --> 01:03:20,215
MATT: Yeah. He'd try and court her, she'd knock it
away. He'd have her followed.

936
01:03:20,895 --> 01:03:23,570
BRIAN: Sounds like me and Ashley's relationship.

937
01:03:23,570 --> 01:03:26,352
MATT: Yeah, well, that's kind of what I was hoping
to show you this later.

938
01:03:26,352 --> 01:03:28,261
LIAM: She is a relentless stalker.

939
01:03:28,261 --> 01:03:29,910
BRIAN: She is, yeah.

940
01:03:29,910 --> 01:03:35,322
MATT: And so he hired the Clasp and said, "Could
you please bring her to me?" And that was when Vax

941
01:03:35,322 --> 01:03:41,092
had his first run-in with the Clasp. He noticed
this guy was following her, took him out, and in

942
01:03:41,092 --> 01:03:47,142
doing so himself, was taken by the Clasp and
inducted into it as his means of paying back the

943
01:03:47,142 --> 01:03:50,470
debt of knocking out one of their members.

944
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:52,853
LIAM: Which was the Pike and Vax game at home.

945
01:03:52,853 --> 01:03:53,991
MATT: No.

946
01:03:53,991 --> 01:03:55,856
LAURA: This was way before that.

947
01:03:55,856 --> 01:03:57,893
MATT: This was a whole off camera storyline.

948
01:03:57,893 --> 01:04:00,096
LIAM: Wasn't that the setup for the Pike and Vax
game?

949
01:04:00,096 --> 01:04:03,716
MATT: It was the setup for it. But it was your
backstory to how you got involved with the Clasp

950
01:04:03,716 --> 01:04:10,121
and got your branding and everything there.
Because at the time, this is really messed up, so

951
01:04:10,121 --> 01:04:15,271
you had talked with the Spireling there at the
time in Westruun, and told the story about how

952
01:04:15,271 --> 01:04:19,192
this was your sister and you were protecting her
and everything. And you offered yourself like,

953
01:04:19,192 --> 01:04:22,765
"Whatever I can do to pay this debt back so that
this doesn't happen, let me know."

954
01:04:22,765 --> 01:04:26,022
LAURA: Take me instead! You Spireling bitch!

955
01:04:26,022 --> 01:04:27,822
LIAM: You're welcome!

956
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:33,502
MATT: The guy who you had knocked out who was
following her, who was also being held down while

957
01:04:33,502 --> 01:04:38,027
you guys were having this back and forth in front
of the Spireling, he accepted what you were doing.

958
01:04:38,027 --> 01:04:42,543
Then for failing, for punishment to the one who
failed, he pulled out this artifact, that's in the--

959
01:04:42,543 --> 01:04:45,343
LIAM: Yeah, tongues. Stick of tongues.

960
01:04:45,343 --> 01:04:51,442
MATT: It's an artifact in the Book of Vile
Darkness. That is just made of tongues stitched

961
01:04:51,442 --> 01:04:54,382
back to back, and it can kind of still move and
flex and quiver.

962
01:04:54,382 --> 01:04:56,149
LAURA: I remember you talking about this I was
like, "What the fuck are you--"

963
01:04:56,149 --> 01:05:00,642
MATT: When you touch it to somebody, they have to
make a saving throw or their flesh gets changed to

964
01:05:00,642 --> 01:05:02,469
whatever form you want it to be.

965
01:05:02,469 --> 01:05:04,883
BRIAN: Oh, Taliesin has one of those at his
house!

966
01:05:04,883 --> 01:05:08,163
LIAM: It's right here!

967
01:05:08,163 --> 01:05:15,942
MATT: This would-be kidnapper that was hired by
the Clasp and failed, his punishment was to be

968
01:05:15,942 --> 01:05:23,476
touched with this and then turned into a replica
of Vex, and then was sent to fill the bounty to

969
01:05:23,476 --> 01:05:25,271
this guy who was obsessed with her.

970
01:05:25,271 --> 01:05:27,892
LAURA: So there's some guy that looks like me
that's probably in a cage somewhere?

971
01:05:27,892 --> 01:05:29,018
MATT: Probably.

972
01:05:29,018 --> 01:05:30,338
LIAM: Is he not dead by now?

973
01:05:30,338 --> 01:05:32,084
MATT: I don't know. Probably not.

974
01:05:32,084 --> 01:05:36,757
LAURA: So if he ever breaks free, there's another
Vex in the world?

975
01:05:36,757 --> 01:05:43,892
MATT: Yes. Who has lived most of their life as a
Clasp member who's probably really messed in the

976
01:05:43,892 --> 01:05:45,923
head right now.

977
01:05:45,923 --> 01:05:50,884
LIAM: That was backstory for one game that Ashley
and I played because we both missed a home game.

978
01:05:50,884 --> 01:05:56,106
Matt was gracious enough to give us a game
together. Then three and a half years later, I'd

979
01:05:56,106 --> 01:06:00,474
totally forgotten about it, we're live on the
internet, and you were like, "By the way," and I

980
01:06:00,474 --> 01:06:03,819
was like, what the fuck was the story? How did it
go? I don't know. I'm telling it to Laura, but I

981
01:06:03,819 --> 01:06:06,542
don't know what I'm talking about!

982
01:06:06,542 --> 01:06:08,123
LAURA: I remember you saying something about
tongues and I was like,

983
01:06:08,123 --> 01:06:10,369
"That's fucking weird, bro."

984
01:06:10,369 --> 01:06:15,633
MARISHA: Hey, I have a question. What would've
happened had we not told the Clasp to-- the half

985
01:06:15,633 --> 01:06:26,723
of us, that I got blamed for-- not told the Clasp
to fuck off? That thing that all but two of us

986
01:06:26,723 --> 01:06:30,156
agreed to, but I got yelled at by Percy. Yeah,
that one.

987
01:06:30,156 --> 01:06:31,924
BRIAN: Thanks, Keyleth.

988
01:06:31,924 --> 01:06:36,871
MATT: The Clasp would've become a source of
information and material and fast movement through

989
01:06:36,871 --> 01:06:40,563
Emon. You guys could've traveled through their
caverns beneath the city--

990
01:06:40,563 --> 01:06:45,699
MARISHA: But they wanted access to the city and
other levels of the government in exchange.

991
01:06:45,699 --> 01:06:50,155
MATT: They wanted in exchange for that
installation in Vasselheim. So they would've been

992
01:06:50,155 --> 01:06:55,713
like, "We will help you. We can help get everyone
out of the city safely. We'll get them to places

993
01:06:55,713 --> 01:06:59,697
that are safe. We can move you in and out of the
city anywhere in Emon safely. We can gather

994
01:06:59,697 --> 01:07:03,192
information for you. We can supply you with
things. You have full disposal of the Clasp in

995
01:07:03,192 --> 01:07:09,308
reclaiming Emon from the Conclave, but when all
this is done, we need you to help us install our

996
01:07:09,308 --> 01:07:13,614
satellite beginnings in Vasselheim."

997
01:07:13,614 --> 01:07:16,309
LAURA: I think that's acceptable.

998
01:07:16,309 --> 01:07:18,644
LIAM: We all survived.

999
01:07:18,644 --> 01:07:23,613
MARISHA: I felt like it wasn't our call to be
like, "Yeah, we can give you Vasselheim."

1000
01:07:23,613 --> 01:07:25,153
LAURA: I would've done it.

1001
01:07:25,153 --> 01:07:26,553
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm totally into it.

1002
01:07:26,553 --> 01:07:27,687
LIAM: We know.

1003
01:07:27,687 --> 01:07:30,364
MARISHA: Keyleth still lingers on in my soul.

1004
01:07:30,364 --> 01:07:37,748
LAURA: Here's my theory about doppelganger Vex.
Later in life, she found the doppelganger and

1005
01:07:37,748 --> 01:07:40,502
hired him/her.

1006
01:07:40,502 --> 01:07:42,270
MARISHA: Where are you going with this?

1007
01:07:42,270 --> 01:07:49,257
LAURA: Because the paparazzi gets overwhelming for
the de Rolo family everywhere you go. So she's the

1008
01:07:49,257 --> 01:07:51,984
lookalike that goes out.

1009
01:07:51,984 --> 01:08:00,264
MATT: I will say, Vex is not aware of this other
Vex's existence and has not encountered them.

1010
01:08:00,264 --> 01:08:03,048
LAURA: Fine. But when she does, she'll hire them.

1011
01:08:03,048 --> 01:08:04,853
MATT: There you go.

1012
01:08:04,853 --> 01:08:11,823
BRIAN: Speaking of the de Rolo family, Lipululu
wants to know what are the names of Percy and Vex's kids.

1013
01:08:11,823 --> 01:08:15,773
LAURA: The pronunciation of the names are getting
worse and worse.

1014
01:08:15,773 --> 01:08:19,430
BRIAN: Look, it's not going to be a good year for
us, folks. What are the names of Percy and Vex's

1015
01:08:19,616 --> 01:08:22,507
kids? Unless you want to keep them private.

1016
01:08:22,507 --> 01:08:23,585
LAURA: It's Nugget--

1017
01:08:23,585 --> 01:08:24,581
TALIESIN: We named a couple of them.

1018
01:08:24,581 --> 01:08:26,758
LAURA: --Nugget, North--

1019
01:08:26,758 --> 01:08:29,186
BRIAN: Nugget North? Isn't that one of Nolan
North's kids' names?

1020
01:08:29,186 --> 01:08:31,032
LAURA: No, those are two names. Nugget, North--

1021
01:08:31,032 --> 01:08:32,427
LIAM: Nugget?

1022
01:08:32,427 --> 01:08:33,326
LAURA: Yeah.

1023
01:08:33,326 --> 01:08:39,337
LIAM: I'm coming back from the dead to ask you
why!

1024
01:08:39,337 --> 01:08:42,580
LAURA: Salsa. Percival Fredrickstein--

1025
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:45,160
BRIAN: Rammstein?

1026
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:46,737
TRAVIS: Cheddar de Rolo.

1027
01:08:46,737 --> 01:08:49,367
SAM: Capoeira.

1028
01:08:49,367 --> 01:08:53,702
LAURA: Bacon. That's a good one. Bacon.

1029
01:08:53,702 --> 01:08:56,471
MARISHA: Bacon de Rolo?

1030
01:08:56,471 --> 01:08:59,488
TALIESIN: And Qwop.

1031
01:08:59,488 --> 01:09:05,297
LAURA: And then Percival Fredrickstein the
Fourth.

1032
01:09:05,297 --> 01:09:09,208
MATT: When you guys decide those names, you should
put them on social media.

1033
01:09:09,208 --> 01:09:15,179
TALIESIN: I kind of like that they don't, so that
if people want to actually play the kids in their

1034
01:09:15,179 --> 01:09:17,422
own games, they can do what they want to do.

1035
01:09:17,422 --> 01:09:19,888
LAURA: I kind of want to name them, though. We'll
name a few of them.

1036
01:09:19,888 --> 01:09:21,698
MATT: You guys name your kids.

1037
01:09:21,698 --> 01:09:23,729
TALIESIN: We haven't had time to sit down and go
over this.

1038
01:09:23,729 --> 01:09:27,556
LIAM: It's like George Foreman. They are all
Percy. Even the girls are all Percy.

1039
01:09:27,556 --> 01:09:31,747
LAURA: Percy, Percy, Percy, Percy, Percy.

1040
01:09:31,747 --> 01:09:34,888
TALIESIN: A couple of them would've gotten the
other siblings' names, I think. We'll go over it.

1041
01:09:34,888 --> 01:09:37,466
BRIAN: Sam, JerrySalami wants to know--

1042
01:09:37,466 --> 01:09:39,524
LIAM: Good name.

1043
01:09:39,524 --> 01:09:45,816
BRIAN: Sounds like the world's lamest gangster.
Hey, it's Jerry Salami. He's going to put you in

1044
01:09:45,816 --> 01:09:47,761
the cement boots.

1045
01:09:47,761 --> 01:09:49,513
LIAM: Jerry Salami's coming for you.

1046
01:09:49,513 --> 01:09:52,133
SAM: Should I be worried?

1047
01:09:52,133 --> 01:10:02,978
BRIAN: It was going to be Andy Dicks' character on
Sopranos, but he got cut. Did Scanlan ever tell

1048
01:10:02,978 --> 01:10:05,858
Kaylie that he let her win the flute competition?

1049
01:10:05,858 --> 01:10:13,888
SAM: I didn't have to. She knew. That's my theory
anyway because, as I found out later in Scanlan's

1050
01:10:13,888 --> 01:10:23,659
life, Kaylie always knows when he is lying. So she
knew and let him so she could get upstairs and try

1051
01:10:23,659 --> 01:10:24,887
to kill him.

1052
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:26,640
MATT: She knew, yeah.

1053
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:32,270
SAM: Yes. She has this sense. She can always tell
when he is lying. She can see through his charms.

1054
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:33,999
TRAVIS: Isn't that a great ability, babe?

1055
01:10:33,999 --> 01:10:37,499
(laughter)

1056
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:41,030
BRIAN: Terrible. Watch a marriage crumble--

1057
01:10:41,030 --> 01:10:43,144
LAURA: You're like the cat with the thing on its
head.

1058
01:10:43,144 --> 01:10:46,439
LIAM: (sings)

1059
01:10:47,959 --> 01:10:51,876
BRIAN: Taliesin. BigCracker wants to know--

1060
01:10:52,369 --> 01:10:53,943
LIAM: Whoa.

1061
01:10:54,337 --> 01:11:04,701
BRIAN: Look, imagine a Ritz cracker the size of
this card that I hold instead of, perhaps, a

1062
01:11:04,701 --> 01:11:06,224
middle aged--

1063
01:11:06,224 --> 01:11:08,721
SAM: White guy.

1064
01:11:08,721 --> 01:11:14,623
BRIAN: White guy who is probably very friendly. He
asks a great question. "When Craven Edge killed

1065
01:11:14,623 --> 01:11:22,119
Grog, how much guilt did Percy feel knowing it was
somewhat his fault for giving him the sword? What

1066
01:11:22,119 --> 01:11:24,799
would he have done if Pike couldn't bring him
back?"

1067
01:11:24,799 --> 01:11:26,164
MARISHA: Yeah, you’ve answered this.

1068
01:11:26,164 --> 01:11:27,302
BRIAN: Have you answered this?

1069
01:11:27,302 --> 01:11:28,734
TALIESIN: Yeah, I feel like I have but--

1070
01:11:28,734 --> 01:11:31,073
SAM: You've never answered it in Christoph Waltz’
wardrobe.

1071
01:11:31,073 --> 01:11:42,829
(laughter)

1072
01:11:42,829 --> 01:11:51,899
TALIESIN: Oh. Wow. That's a lot. I'm just going to
be sitting like this for the rest of the evening.

1073
01:11:51,899 --> 01:11:56,254
No, it's weird. One more--

1074
01:11:56,254 --> 01:11:59,859
(laughter)

1075
01:11:59,859 --> 01:12:04,295
LAURA: Out of all the things that Taliesin has
worn, this is the one you are getting the shit for.

1076
01:12:04,295 --> 01:12:08,242
TALIESIN: I'm so excited; this is everything I’ve
hoped for and more.

1077
01:12:08,242 --> 01:12:12,037
LIAM: That's bingo!

1078
01:12:12,037 --> 01:12:17,834
TAlIESIN: It hardly matters how guilty he was. He
wasn't going to tell anybody. He would have just

1079
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:23,074
gone on the list of things I lived with. It would
be, "Oh, that's unfortunate, but it would be worse

1080
01:12:23,074 --> 01:12:27,526
if I actually got blamed for it so I am just going
to keep my mouth shut." Why make things worse by

1081
01:12:27,526 --> 01:12:30,685
actually taking blame?

1082
01:12:30,685 --> 01:12:33,015
LIAM: My abs.

1083
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:38,275
MARISHA: Oh my god, that was so good.

1084
01:12:38,275 --> 01:12:46,893
BRIAN: Sam, ILikePorkAndFighting wants to know,
"Did Tary strike everything off his list?"

1085
01:12:48,058 --> 01:12:51,568
SAM: No. Shit. I have it somewhere.

1086
01:12:51,693 --> 01:12:53,002
BRIAN: Tweet the list.

1087
01:12:53,002 --> 01:12:56,774
SAM: I have a list. I wrote down the things that I
accomplished and the things that were left to be

1088
01:12:56,774 --> 01:13:05,502
done. I also had a separate list of all the things
Tary did with Vox Machina that he was going to

1089
01:13:05,502 --> 01:13:13,900
present to his Dad. Possibly. To prove that he was
worthy. But no, he did not accomplish everything

1090
01:13:13,948 --> 01:13:19,042
on the list. Yet. But there are many more
adventures to be had for the two weeks before he

1091
01:13:19,042 --> 01:13:23,532
gets killed as a member of the Darrington
Brigade.

1092
01:13:23,532 --> 01:13:31,114
BRIAN: That's awesome. Taliesin and Laura,
Vohollica wants to know: "If Percy's first death had

1093
01:13:31,114 --> 01:13:35,673
"not happened do you think that Vex and Percy would
have spent their lives as really awkward neighbors

1094
01:13:35,792 --> 01:13:38,124
"without ever realizing that they were pining for
each other?"

1095
01:13:38,124 --> 01:13:39,800
LAURA: We did talk about this, too.

1096
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:44,679
BRIAN: God damn it, it was so long ago and the
mescaline and all the stuff.

1097
01:13:44,679 --> 01:13:46,776
It's just hard to remember.

1098
01:13:46,776 --> 01:13:51,292
LAURA: I think we said that they probably would
have eventually come to it, but it would have

1099
01:13:51,292 --> 01:13:52,719
taken a lot longer.

1100
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:54,420
TALIESIN: And it would have been very awkward and
strange.

1101
01:13:54,420 --> 01:13:56,047
LAURA: Yeah for a while. For a good long while.

1102
01:13:56,047 --> 01:14:00,390
LIAM: You once said to me behind the scenes, "If
he doesn't make a move, it's never going to happen."

1103
01:14:00,390 --> 01:14:01,945
LAURA: Yeah.

1104
01:14:01,945 --> 01:14:08,410
TALIESIN: That may have just been because there
was a lot of tension of when that was going to happen.

1105
01:14:08,410 --> 01:14:11,253
LAURA: And you did hear what she said?

1106
01:14:11,253 --> 01:14:15,141
TALIESIN: Yeah, I did. So that was a thing.

1107
01:14:15,141 --> 01:14:17,990
BRIAN: What she said?

1108
01:14:17,990 --> 01:14:19,716
TALIESIN: When I was unconscious.

1109
01:14:19,716 --> 01:14:21,252
BRIAN, TALIESIN, and LAURA: Yeah.

1110
01:14:21,252 --> 01:14:25,910
BRIAN: Unconscience. Marisha, speaking of
unconscience, a question from you from our friend

1111
01:14:25,910 --> 01:14:32,205
TiamatZX. "How cathartic was it for Keyleth to not
submit to her vengeful desires and put Raishan in

1112
01:14:32,205 --> 01:14:36,511
"her place by killing what made her who she was,
thus leaving behind a

1113
01:14:36,511 --> 01:14:39,089
"feral shadow of her former self?"

1114
01:14:39,089 --> 01:14:43,895
MARISHA: It was pretty gnarly.

1115
01:14:43,895 --> 01:14:45,619
BRIAN: Neat.

1116
01:14:45,619 --> 01:14:46,891
MARISHA: Pretty gnarly.

1117
01:14:46,891 --> 01:14:52,908
BRIAN: An answer worthy of a great question.

1118
01:14:52,908 --> 01:14:59,976
MARISHA: I fulfilled my promise. Right? I guess. I
mean-- Kerrek killed her.

1119
01:14:59,976 --> 01:15:04,570
MATT: Really, you enabled the death, though.

1120
01:15:04,570 --> 01:15:08,022
TALIESIN: He unplugged the machine, you
actually--

1121
01:15:08,022 --> 01:15:13,380
MARISHA: It was fitting, as kind of my mentor.
Yeah, it's good.

1122
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:18,542
LIAM: That fact would have mentally tortured her
far more than the actual killing blow.

1123
01:15:18,542 --> 01:15:21,322
LAURA: Isn't it so weird that so often the guests
got the killing blow?

1124
01:15:21,322 --> 01:15:22,809
MATT: That was crazy.

1125
01:15:22,809 --> 01:15:24,699
SAM: Mary especially.

1126
01:15:24,699 --> 01:15:26,271
BRIAN: Mary killed everyone.

1127
01:15:26,271 --> 01:15:34,686
MATT: It's frustrating from my end, because I wanted to
give some of these epic deaths to the mainstay

1128
01:15:34,686 --> 01:15:37,058
party, but... what are you going to do?

1129
01:15:37,058 --> 01:15:40,237
LAURA: I liked that the guests got them.

1130
01:15:40,237 --> 01:15:45,221
MATT: It made a good feeling. It does make for a
cool, memorable experience.

1131
01:15:45,221 --> 01:15:46,627
LAURA: Yeah, totally.

1132
01:15:46,627 --> 01:15:49,363
MATT: But also it's like the guest comes in and is
like, "Hey guys! Cool, thanks! I win, bye!"

1133
01:15:49,363 --> 01:15:53,388
SAM: Who was your least favorite guest?

1134
01:15:53,388 --> 01:15:55,190
BRIAN: That's a great question.

1135
01:15:55,190 --> 01:15:56,481
MATT: Will Friedle.

1136
01:15:56,481 --> 01:15:57,478
BRIAN: Probably.

1137
01:15:57,478 --> 01:15:59,686
MATT: I'm kidding, I love you Will, you're
amazing.

1138
01:15:59,686 --> 01:16:01,890
BRIAN: I didn't care for--

1139
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:08,335
who was the fellow with the--

1140
01:16:08,335 --> 01:16:10,386
MATT: Danny Glover?

1141
01:16:10,386 --> 01:16:16,823
BRIAN: Danny Glover, yeah, ever since he got those
dentures, didn't understand anything he said. No

1142
01:16:16,823 --> 01:16:21,754
offense to the denture people out there. Guys,
little bit of a situation here. That's all the

1143
01:16:21,754 --> 01:16:26,607
questions that I have for the cast, I have several
questions left for Matt. Do you guys want to sit

1144
01:16:26,607 --> 01:16:29,958
here while I ask them to him or go out and eat
that delicious food that's out there?

1145
01:16:29,958 --> 01:16:31,573
TRAVIS: Peace out, see you guys next week!

1146
01:16:31,573 --> 01:16:33,195
LIAM: We'll just keep saying taint, that's fine.

1147
01:16:33,195 --> 01:16:35,211
BRIAN: Yeah, just say taint for every answer of
Matt's.

1148
01:16:35,211 --> 01:16:36,432
MATT: Please.

1149
01:16:36,432 --> 01:16:39,247
BRIAN: No, seriously, you guys are more than
welcome-- unless, do you guys have any other

1150
01:16:39,247 --> 01:16:43,732
questions for each other or anything you want to
ask Matt that you didn't get a chance to?

1151
01:16:43,732 --> 01:16:49,654
MARISHA: Oh, I have a question. What's with the
sphinxes and why didn't they live together

1152
01:16:49,654 --> 01:16:55,243
anymore? So sad, they were spouses and then they
were separated.

1153
01:16:55,243 --> 01:17:00,694
MATT: Well, when you live with somebody for a very
long time, eventually you enjoy the space you have

1154
01:17:00,694 --> 01:17:02,586
from each other.

1155
01:17:02,586 --> 01:17:04,305
LAURA: I'm going to throw something at you.

1156
01:17:04,305 --> 01:17:13,465
MATT: Well, they're creatures of purpose and they
had purposes in different areas, as was the

1157
01:17:13,465 --> 01:17:19,981
assignments of the Knowing Mistress. They have the
ability to communicate and every now and then

1158
01:17:19,981 --> 01:17:21,512
would probably meet up.

1159
01:17:21,512 --> 01:17:24,122
LAURA: For that sweet, sweet sphinx loving.

1160
01:17:24,122 --> 01:17:27,051
MARISHA: Yeah, I was going to say, they Skype.

1161
01:17:27,051 --> 01:17:32,612
MATT: Sphexting.

1162
01:17:32,612 --> 01:17:34,258
MARISHA: Sphexting?

1163
01:17:34,258 --> 01:17:36,478
BRIAN: What are you guys most excited about?

1164
01:17:36,478 --> 01:17:39,044
LAURA: For the new campaign, you mean?

1165
01:17:39,044 --> 01:17:43,165
TRAVIS: Just seeing what the fuck everybody's
doing. We haven't seen anything yet.

1166
01:17:43,165 --> 01:17:44,955
BRIAN: Any secrets among the group still?

1167
01:17:44,955 --> 01:17:45,856
LIAM: Sure.

1168
01:17:45,856 --> 01:17:46,749
LAURA: Yeah.

1169
01:17:46,749 --> 01:17:48,259
TALIESIN: I've been torturing everybody.

1170
01:17:48,259 --> 01:17:51,824
LIAM: Yeah, we don't know what his class is, we
know what everybody else's class is, but not

1171
01:17:51,824 --> 01:17:52,917
Taliesin Jaffe.

1172
01:17:52,917 --> 01:17:57,921
TALIESIN: I've been very specifically torturing
all of them. It's great, it's making me younger.

1173
01:17:57,921 --> 01:18:01,938
SAM: I don't know much about what Ashley's doing,
right?

1174
01:18:01,938 --> 01:18:03,590
TALIESIN: I know a little bit of what Ashley's
doing.

1175
01:18:03,590 --> 01:18:11,710
TRAVIS: Plus it was great releasing that
silhouette art that had nothing to do with the

1176
01:18:11,710 --> 01:18:15,360
campaign at all, everybody's like, "Oh, those are
the new characters!"

1177
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:18,643
BRIAN: That's been the funniest part of the
silhouette watch.

1178
01:18:18,643 --> 01:18:21,558
TALIESIN: We broke that, right? They know that
those aren't the characters?

1179
01:18:21,558 --> 01:18:23,292
LAURA: Those are not even close.

1180
01:18:23,292 --> 01:18:32,233
BRIAN: Chris Lockheed has spent the last two weeks
telling people this is not the new characters.

1181
01:18:32,233 --> 01:18:35,295
LAURA: I have seen a couple people online that got
everybody right.

1182
01:18:35,295 --> 01:18:39,002
MARISHA: Really?

1183
01:18:39,002 --> 01:18:40,691
LAURA: I've seen like two people that got
everybody right.

1184
01:18:40,691 --> 01:18:42,693
TRAVIS: Now, that's out of 80,000 guesses, but yeah.

1185
01:18:42,693 --> 01:18:44,151
LAURA: But it's pretty impressive.

1186
01:18:44,151 --> 01:18:46,356
BRIAN: And those two people are--

1187
01:18:46,356 --> 01:18:51,506
MARISHA: That's like winning the superfecta at the
Kentucky Derby. If you had a prize pool for that,

1188
01:18:51,506 --> 01:18:53,134
oh man, be a lot of money.

1189
01:18:53,134 --> 01:18:56,116
LAURA: I think I saw one person who got--

1190
01:18:56,116 --> 01:19:03,025
BRIAN: Well, that was the Kentucky beat by Marisha
Ray. A regular segment on the next season of Talks Machina.

1191
01:19:03,025 --> 01:19:07,712
MARISHA: It's true! Do you know how much money the
superfecta pays up? Whatever, fuck you guys, it's

1192
01:19:07,712 --> 01:19:10,181
a big deal, it's millions.

1193
01:19:10,181 --> 01:19:12,436
TRAVIS: Superfecta, long island iced tea? No?

1194
01:19:12,436 --> 01:19:14,069
MARISHA: Fucking mint julep? No?

1195
01:19:14,069 --> 01:19:16,010
SAM: Coming up, Marisha tastes bourbons.

1196
01:19:16,010 --> 01:19:20,528
(laughter)

1197
01:19:20,528 --> 01:19:24,516
MARISHA: Let's go down Whiskey Road, you guys,
let's go on the bourbon tour.

1198
01:19:24,516 --> 01:19:28,319
BRIAN: Well, should we take five and then, Matt, do
you want to come back and answer some questions?

1199
01:19:28,319 --> 01:19:29,607
MATT: Sure, let's do it.

1200
01:19:29,607 --> 01:19:31,697
BRIAN: Let's do it. Thank you guys, stick around,
we're going to take five minutes--

1201
01:19:31,697 --> 01:19:33,169
can we do that, crew?

1202
01:19:33,169 --> 01:19:34,745
OFF-SCREEN: (hesitantly) Yeah.

1203
01:19:34,745 --> 01:19:39,513
(laughter)

1204
01:19:39,513 --> 01:19:42,734
BRIAN: It's my last night, they know.

1205
01:19:42,734 --> 01:19:45,249
SAM: Do they even have anything to go to, if you
go to a break?

1206
01:19:45,249 --> 01:19:47,944
BRIAN: Yeah, they can go to the delicious Critical
Role art or--

1207
01:19:47,944 --> 01:19:49,451
OFF-SCREEN: Yeah, art sizzle’s good.

1208
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:51,238
BRIAN: Art sizzle’s good, okay.

1209
01:19:51,238 --> 01:19:52,651
LAURA: Ten minutes.

1210
01:19:52,651 --> 01:19:56,229
BRIAN: What? We can go as long as--

1211
01:19:56,229 --> 01:19:58,399
SAM: It's supposed to be a 90 minute broadcast,
it's almost over.

1212
01:19:58,399 --> 01:20:02,319
BRIAN: I know, but there's still 20 questions for
Matt that I want to get to, but I don't want you

1213
01:20:02,319 --> 01:20:06,833
guys to sit. I sprinkled some in, and then I asked
you guys all this stuff, but mainly this was a lot

1214
01:20:06,833 --> 01:20:09,408
of things that you guys could just get out the way.

1215
01:20:09,408 --> 01:20:11,223
LIAM: I have so many questions, though.

1216
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:12,494
So many questions.

1217
01:20:12,494 --> 01:20:14,306
BRIAN: Well, then stick around on the set, then.

1218
01:20:14,306 --> 01:20:16,032
SAM: It's just Brian, Matt, and Liam?

1219
01:20:16,032 --> 01:20:17,395
BRIAN: Yes!

1220
01:20:17,395 --> 01:20:18,927
LIAM: Are we all getting kicked off? Is that
what's happening?

1221
01:20:18,927 --> 01:20:20,419
BRIAN: You're not getting kicked off, but you--

1222
01:20:20,419 --> 01:20:23,709
LIAM: Well, I think I'll have some of that fine,
Japanese whiskey that's in the other room.

1223
01:20:23,709 --> 01:20:29,326
BRIAN: Thank you, Aki, for providing. She even got
bored and left from Laura's answers. All right,

1224
01:20:29,326 --> 01:20:32,581
we'll be back in-- how many minutes, guys?

1225
01:20:32,581 --> 01:20:37,267
OFF-SCREEN: Ten? I don't know.

1226
01:20:37,267 --> 01:20:40,363
BRIAN: We'll be back five to seven minutes from
now, you'll see some of us back here on this

1227
01:20:40,363 --> 01:20:45,940
professional Q & A. Stay turnt, my friends,
we'll be right back.

1228
01:20:45,940 --> 01:20:50,034
ALL: Happy new year!

1229
01:20:50,034 --> 01:20:51,936
MATT: Good evening.

1230
01:20:51,936 --> 01:20:53,342
BRIAN: That's all we had planned.

1231
01:20:53,342 --> 01:20:55,197
MATT: Mm-hmm.

1232
01:20:55,197 --> 01:21:03,147
BRIAN: We're back! Your two dads, in our robes,
here to answer questions.

1233
01:21:03,147 --> 01:21:05,937
MATT: This is the best alternate universe "My Two
Dads."

1234
01:21:05,937 --> 01:21:08,042
BRIAN: This is, I know. That was a great show.

1235
01:21:08,042 --> 01:21:09,460
MATT: It was a show.

1236
01:21:09,460 --> 01:21:10,842
BRIAN: Was that a movie? No, that was a show.

1237
01:21:10,842 --> 01:21:11,794
MATT: It was a show.

1238
01:21:11,794 --> 01:21:15,174
BRIAN: I was thinking of "Three Men and a Little
Baby". Starring TV's "Magnum."

1239
01:21:15,174 --> 01:21:16,430
MATT: Yes.

1240
01:21:16,430 --> 01:21:20,608
BRIAN: Matt, I have some questions left over here
that people are dying to know. We're going to burn

1241
01:21:20,608 --> 01:21:28,108
through these. Everyone else left because there's food
and alcohol nearby. So, that's the way it works.

1242
01:21:28,108 --> 01:21:32,143
VexMeUpBeforeYouGoGo is back with a question.

1243
01:21:32,143 --> 01:21:34,526
MATT: Well played.

1244
01:21:34,526 --> 01:21:39,695
BRIAN: Might we learn more about Vesh in the
fut-ore, future. Fut-ore? Do I drive a Jaguar? Or

1245
01:21:39,695 --> 01:21:44,765
could you tell us about her a bit more? Her,
question mark, a bit more. You've said that

1246
01:21:44,765 --> 01:21:49,177
things, as in who Vesh is et cetera, weren't quite
as simple as Kash thought.

1247
01:21:49,177 --> 01:21:54,359
MATT: Correct. I mean, I'll go into it a little
bit, because, who knows, she's still an entity in

1248
01:21:54,359 --> 01:21:58,802
the world, it might play into the next campaign, I
don't know. There's a lot of questions where part

1249
01:21:58,802 --> 01:22:02,996
of me doesn't want to answer because I don't want
to rob people of their own interpretations, and

1250
01:22:02,996 --> 01:22:07,053
also because maybe things will show up in future
campaigns, I don't know. With Vesh in particular,

1251
01:22:07,053 --> 01:22:13,061
Vesh is an entity that presents itself as a god,
like anything powerful would that wants to be

1252
01:22:13,061 --> 01:22:21,606
worshipped or given attention. But isn't part of
the pantheon. As to whether or not she has

1253
01:22:21,606 --> 01:22:26,704
aspirations for it, or is just trying to convince
individuals of that to get what she wants, you

1254
01:22:26,704 --> 01:22:35,081
know... I'll say that she's a powerful entity,
powerful enough to grant divine spells to her one

1255
01:22:35,081 --> 01:22:43,498
follower. I will say that Kash is not the first
suitor that she's cycled through. Yeah, I'll leave

1256
01:22:43,498 --> 01:22:48,322
it there. Probably the most handsome. Not at all.
He's not handsome at all.

1257
01:22:48,322 --> 01:22:50,070
Kash has a very low charisma.

1258
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:59,884
BRIAN: Yeah. Cariboukai wants to know what were
your original ideas for Kynan? Did you have any

1259
01:22:59,884 --> 01:23:03,302
plans for him had Vox Machina accepted him into
their fold in some way?

1260
01:23:03,302 --> 01:23:11,520
MATT: Kynan I had written to be their first
fanboy. As a party of adventurers begins to become

1261
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:19,402
renowned and they've had a parade set for them as
thanks for helping Uriel Tal'Dorei. He was their

1262
01:23:19,402 --> 01:23:24,839
first interpretation of dealing with that
attention, and so my intent was for him to be that

1263
01:23:24,839 --> 01:23:31,094
lovable, slightly annoying young upstart that
wants to prove himself and be friends with them

1264
01:23:31,094 --> 01:23:32,830
and wants to learn from them.

1265
01:23:32,830 --> 01:23:34,441
BRIAN: Oh, like me with you guys.

1266
01:23:34,441 --> 01:23:36,729
MATT: Essentially, yeah, and we treated you
basically the same way.

1267
01:23:36,729 --> 01:23:37,799
BRIAN: Yeah.

1268
01:23:37,799 --> 01:23:44,791
MATT: So, yeah, the idea was for him to be this
interesting obstacle on the way of renown,

1269
01:23:44,791 --> 01:23:48,637
somebody that would want to tag along, that they'd
have to protect or leave behind, or could

1270
01:23:48,637 --> 01:23:56,843
eventually be groomed into a hero if they chose
to, or in the circumstances that laid out, give

1271
01:23:56,843 --> 01:24:01,220
such a harsh beat of reality, in a way that
someone as young and impressionable couldn't

1272
01:24:01,220 --> 01:24:06,705
emotionally process in a healthy way, and it was
so crushing to him at the time, whether or not

1273
01:24:06,705 --> 01:24:12,196
that was the intent, sent him on a very dark path
and thankfully they were able to manage to pull

1274
01:24:12,196 --> 01:24:16,901
him from that. I didn't expect any of his
story to go that way when I was developing him.

1275
01:24:16,901 --> 01:24:20,427
The whole interaction, I didn't expect it to go
that way.

1276
01:24:20,427 --> 01:24:22,413
BRIAN: Yeah, well that happened a few times.

1277
01:24:22,413 --> 01:24:24,023
MATT: A whole lot of times.

1278
01:24:24,023 --> 01:24:28,966
BRIAN: I don't know if I, or someone else, had
asked you who your favorite-- I know it's got to

1279
01:24:28,966 --> 01:24:34,886
be hard to pick one-- who your favorite NPC, as a
person and maybe as to play, is? Or maybe those

1280
01:24:34,886 --> 01:24:36,591
are different questions and that's okay.

1281
01:24:36,591 --> 01:24:38,116
MATT: That's hard.

1282
01:24:38,116 --> 01:24:41,923
BRIAN: I'm not asking you to choose, but I am.

1283
01:24:41,923 --> 01:24:49,819
MATT: There's different categories I'd put them
in. As far as villains go, as much as I was

1284
01:24:49,819 --> 01:24:55,513
excited to play, to jump into the role of my own
interpretation of Vecna, who's this classic D&D

1285
01:24:55,513 --> 01:25:02,182
villain, Raishan and the Briarwoods were both such
living entities in my brain, and for different

1286
01:25:02,182 --> 01:25:06,520
reasons I enjoyed jumping into those shoes. It's
hard to pick.

1287
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:08,253
BRIAN: Senokir was one that you liked, right?

1288
01:25:08,253 --> 01:25:12,401
MATT: Senokir came out of nowhere, he was
completely spontaneous and he was a fun one. Just

1289
01:25:12,401 --> 01:25:15,646
because of the physicality and the creep factor
and being able to just make the players feel

1290
01:25:15,646 --> 01:25:17,789
suddenly very uncomfortable.

1291
01:25:17,789 --> 01:25:19,183
BRIAN: It was so uncomfortable.

1292
01:25:19,183 --> 01:25:20,559
MATT: It's great.

1293
01:25:20,559 --> 01:25:23,337
BRIAN: Oh, my god. And then, the box.

1294
01:25:23,337 --> 01:25:28,693
MATT: Oh yeah, that was fun. I have a special
place in my heart for Allura, because Allura,

1295
01:25:28,693 --> 01:25:35,209
wasn't intended to be, but in hindsight I can see
was my self-insertion NPC if there was. The one

1296
01:25:35,209 --> 01:25:41,162
where I felt was me trying to protect my friends
and trying to be a guide in places. I feel

1297
01:25:41,162 --> 01:25:46,275
there's a little part of me in each NPC, but in
Allura probably more than most. Her and Gilmore.

1298
01:25:46,275 --> 01:25:50,463
BRIAN: Have you had that happen in other campaigns
you've done, where you find an NPC or create one

1299
01:25:50,463 --> 01:25:52,551
that sort of is an extension of yourself?

1300
01:25:52,551 --> 01:25:55,844
MATT: A little bit, but I haven't had a campaign
that I've been so emotionally invested before,

1301
01:25:55,844 --> 01:25:58,816
it's been a variety of different players. I've had
some players that were more into the roleplay,

1302
01:25:58,816 --> 01:26:02,607
some players that were more into the mechanics and
the combat, I haven't really had a game until this

1303
01:26:02,607 --> 01:26:09,728
group of fuckers, where I can get so invested in
the NPC that I created, if that makes sense. It's

1304
01:26:09,728 --> 01:26:14,414
still a very new level for me as a DM.

1305
01:26:14,414 --> 01:26:20,573
BRIAN: Well, you wouldn't be able to tell. You
hate it when I say shit like that, I'm going to

1306
01:26:20,573 --> 01:26:25,157
keep doing that. Seedy88 wants to know, "Could you
share what happened to Cassandra between the time

1307
01:26:25,157 --> 01:26:29,316
"she took several arrows to the chest as she fled
Whitestone and the moment when Percy found her?"

1308
01:26:29,316 --> 01:26:35,610
MATT: Oh, yeah, okay. Cassandra was left to die in
the snow and as she was bleeding out she was

1309
01:26:35,610 --> 01:26:44,850
recovered by some of the Whitestone civilians, a
hunting squad that was out found her still alive,

1310
01:26:44,850 --> 01:26:50,707
brought her back and nursed her partially back to
health, knowing who she was. But in the time that

1311
01:26:50,707 --> 01:26:57,215
she was recovering, they were discovered by the
Briarwoods or the Briarwoods' lackeys and were

1312
01:26:57,215 --> 01:27:03,223
slaughtered, and Cassandra was recovered by them
and nursed back to health after that. She then got

1313
01:27:03,223 --> 01:27:12,243
to watch her whole family get hung, the corpses
anyway, on the Sun Tree and was subjected to a lot

1314
01:27:12,243 --> 01:27:19,986
of brainwashing over a long period of time, was
forced to become a member of their family, was

1315
01:27:19,986 --> 01:27:25,175
forced to eat dinner and breakfast with them every
day. They saw her as an asset to keep the people

1316
01:27:25,175 --> 01:27:29,583
under control. She was a connection to the old
regime, and they could kill her at any time, but

1317
01:27:29,583 --> 01:27:33,569
she probably was more useful in the long run. So
they kept her around, and she became this kind of

1318
01:27:33,569 --> 01:27:40,236
plaything, this adopted child that they kept
around. For years and years, she would try and

1319
01:27:40,236 --> 01:27:45,205
flee and escape and they would punish her for it
and eventually got, through a combination of

1320
01:27:45,205 --> 01:27:47,951
brainwashing and Stockholm Syndrome...

1321
01:27:47,951 --> 01:27:52,284
BRIAN: Oh, where you actually fall in love with or
begin to--

1322
01:27:52,284 --> 01:27:58,616
MATT: Yeah, and so they began to use her to weed
out seeds of rebellion in the city and destroy

1323
01:27:58,616 --> 01:28:02,725
them internally. They would send her out into the
city to find those, and be like, "I want to start

1324
01:28:02,725 --> 01:28:05,301
"a rebellion, who do I talk to?" They'd be like,
"Oh, talk to this guy," and she'd be like, "Okay."

1325
01:28:05,301 --> 01:28:08,912
She'd go and find out where the rebellion's
building in Whitestone and return and tell them

1326
01:28:08,912 --> 01:28:12,324
where it was happening and they would wipe them
out. And they would quell any sort of uprising

1327
01:28:12,324 --> 01:28:19,324
using Cassandra as an agent. When Vox Machina
arrived, seeing her brother still alive, and

1328
01:28:19,324 --> 01:28:25,106
seeing the possible fall of the Briarwoods was
just enough to break her from that and then there

1329
01:28:25,106 --> 01:28:30,006
was a recovery period. A lot of her just trying to
figure out who she was and dealing with the guilt

1330
01:28:30,006 --> 01:28:35,713
of the things that she did do, even though she
knew it wasn't her fault, you can't get over that

1331
01:28:35,713 --> 01:28:39,449
right away. That's something she's going to live
with for a while, but she's doing the best she can

1332
01:28:39,449 --> 01:28:42,342
to make it right for people, because of the things
she did.

1333
01:28:42,342 --> 01:28:44,141
BRIAN: But that's a lot of residual damage.

1334
01:28:44,141 --> 01:28:48,108
MATT: Oh yeah, she's a very complicated NPC that
we didn't get to express too much, but I didn't

1335
01:28:48,108 --> 01:28:54,204
feel it was necessary either. Her strength and
inner stoicism, I think, said volumes of where she was.

1336
01:28:54,204 --> 01:28:57,452
BRIAN: Yeah, and her mystery created a lot of
intrigue as well.

1337
01:28:57,452 --> 01:28:58,612
MATT: I hope so.

1338
01:28:58,612 --> 01:29:05,826
BRIAN: It definitely did. No, it definitely did.
Question that I have been thinking about, what are

1339
01:29:05,826 --> 01:29:12,415
for you, as you're in these weeks and these months
preparing for taking on a new campaign, and

1340
01:29:12,415 --> 01:29:18,108
luckily getting to start at low levels and you're
not dealing with a lot of the massive stuff that

1341
01:29:18,108 --> 01:29:22,309
you're dealing with at the end of a campaign,
but you are thinking about the end of that

1342
01:29:22,309 --> 01:29:28,060
campaign before it begins and how you map out and
everything. What are the truths of storytelling

1343
01:29:28,060 --> 01:29:32,761
that are the most important for you when you're
thinking about something like this? Because

1344
01:29:32,761 --> 01:29:42,172
obviously you know you can't be married too much
to an idea and hold onto it in a place of

1345
01:29:42,172 --> 01:29:48,526
preciousness too tightly, because you're with a
group of people who can change that course at the

1346
01:29:48,526 --> 01:29:54,671
drop of a hat or at a bad roll or-- some things,
other things take a lot more time to mess up. You

1347
01:29:54,671 --> 01:30:01,186
have to be malleable all the time in the
storytelling. So what are the pillars for you of

1348
01:30:01,186 --> 01:30:07,679
stuff where, "This is definitely something that I
have to keep"? Is that hard for you?

1349
01:30:07,679 --> 01:30:12,579
MATT: I don't think it's hard-- It's hard when
you start, because when you begin running games,

1350
01:30:12,579 --> 01:30:20,266
your comfort, your safety blanket, if you will, is
the stuff that you have prepared. That's what

1351
01:30:20,266 --> 01:30:24,012
makes you feel comfortable in the space. The more
you play, the more you run games, the more you

1352
01:30:24,012 --> 01:30:30,205
learn, that does bring comfort, but part of the
joy is listening to the players, seeing what they

1353
01:30:30,205 --> 01:30:34,743
do and change and actively alter what you've
prepared, and finding ways to incorporate that

1354
01:30:34,743 --> 01:30:41,123
into the things that you have already worked on
and prepared. For me, the core idea is making sure

1355
01:30:41,123 --> 01:30:47,522
you have a direction you're going, but be open
and willing to take the choices and the decisions

1356
01:30:47,522 --> 01:30:52,464
the players make and let that shift and alter what
you have prepared and in many cases will surprise

1357
01:30:52,464 --> 01:30:57,826
you and end up developing something much more deep
and interesting than what-- You're only one

1358
01:30:57,826 --> 01:31:06,411
person, your input in a vacuum is probably pretty
decent. But the final product of having all these

1359
01:31:06,411 --> 01:31:10,790
friends come together and eventually build the
narrative that leads to this points, as long as

1360
01:31:10,790 --> 01:31:14,712
you're paying attention and you're open to taking
these subconscious suggestions they're throwing

1361
01:31:14,712 --> 01:31:20,133
towards you as they develop the story, it'll end
up being much more fleshed-out and being much

1362
01:31:20,133 --> 01:31:27,368
more impactful for them, and they themselves will sense the
impact they've had on the direction they traversed

1363
01:31:27,368 --> 01:31:32,938
with this characters. You can't be too married to
it, you want to have a comfort of an idea where

1364
01:31:32,938 --> 01:31:37,165
you're going, but constantly be listening and
taking notes about the things the players do and

1365
01:31:37,165 --> 01:31:41,021
see how that would change the trajectory that
you're planning, and let it, honestly, in a lot of

1366
01:31:41,021 --> 01:31:48,832
cases. A big rule for me now is setting events and
factions and a direction that will be happening

1367
01:31:48,949 --> 01:31:53,467
concurrently with the game as they progress.
Whether or not they intersect with them in certain

1368
01:31:53,467 --> 01:31:58,108
times will gauge how they can influence the
directions where those different factions or

1369
01:31:58,108 --> 01:32:03,326
storylines are going. If they avoid them the
whole game, then it'll definitely change whether

1370
01:32:03,326 --> 01:32:08,566
or not they end up encountering multiple times and
plucking those threads earlier on. For me, that's

1371
01:32:08,566 --> 01:32:12,385
really exciting as a game master, is to see what
the players can alter at certain times and

1372
01:32:12,385 --> 01:32:13,598
surprise you.

1373
01:32:13,598 --> 01:32:20,559
BRIAN: So you're saying storytelling in this
context is as much about listening and being open.

1374
01:32:20,559 --> 01:32:28,694
You sitting down at the table every Thursday, with
your heart open to where what they bring is going

1375
01:32:28,694 --> 01:32:32,499
to change the story and ultimately end up
moving it forward.

1376
01:32:32,499 --> 01:32:39,251
MATT: I don't solidly the plan more than one
session ahead. I'll loosely plan arcs and maybe a

1377
01:32:39,251 --> 01:32:45,051
few sessions outlined and possibilities, but
session to session the players will make choices

1378
01:32:45,051 --> 01:32:49,767
that'll change what you've prepared. Now it is
either being a waste of time if you spent much

1379
01:32:49,767 --> 01:32:53,370
time preparing it in advance, but you
instinctively may be trying to railroad or push

1380
01:32:53,370 --> 01:32:58,023
them towards something that you had been hoping would
happen three, four sessions down the way, and

1381
01:32:58,023 --> 01:33:02,544
sometimes that can work fine, but for me, it's
more thrilling to let the players really guide their

1382
01:33:02,544 --> 01:33:03,927
destiny a bit.

1383
01:33:03,970 --> 01:33:10,029
BRIAN: Can we get a fog machine on the Dwarven
Forge this time? I see people tweet some pretty

1384
01:33:10,029 --> 01:33:15,684
awesome pictures of their Dwarven Forge setups and
they have dry ice and stuff like that. We've

1385
01:33:15,684 --> 01:33:21,900
got the budget, with them firing me we've got some
extra two, three, four, five, seven, eight bucks

1386
01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:23,040
lying around.

1387
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:26,444
MATT: It's more like a free-time thing. I do what
I can with the time I have.

1388
01:33:26,444 --> 01:33:29,405
BRIAN: I know. Sometimes they get built during the
break.

1389
01:33:29,405 --> 01:33:36,501
MATT: Yeah, you'll see me change pieces between,
based on the choices they make. Battlefields

1390
01:33:36,501 --> 01:33:40,568
that’ll never happen versus where they're going
and I'm like, "Shit, I have to re-jangle this."

1391
01:33:40,568 --> 01:33:45,285
BRIAN: It's always funny because whatever pieces
you leave behind Ryan Green puts in his vest.

1392
01:33:45,285 --> 01:33:50,203
MATT: It's funny because sometimes they are eating
and rehydrating and I'm a mad man in here going

1393
01:33:50,203 --> 01:33:52,040
like, "Shit, ugh."

1394
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:56,375
BRIAN: I know, and by the time we have to come
back, Matt is like, "I didn’t even get to pee! I

1395
01:33:56,375 --> 01:33:59,363
"was building what is hopefully going to kill all
of them."

1396
01:33:59,363 --> 01:34:01,256
MATT: Well, the new campaign will have a catheter
so it'll be much easier.

1397
01:34:01,256 --> 01:34:02,951
BRIAN: Yeah, we got one put in the chair.

1398
01:34:02,951 --> 01:34:07,244
MATT: I'm glad we got that approved, by the way.
It's a little expensive, right, you know.

1399
01:34:07,244 --> 01:34:11,524
BRIAN: Sucks that I have to wipe it down every
week. Cariboukai wants to know, "What were you--"

1400
01:34:11,524 --> 01:34:17,838
no, just kidding, we asked that. @Farandaway15,
"You’ve mentioned that if Scanlan didn't destroy

1401
01:34:17,838 --> 01:34:23,100
"the gun, that there was more planned for Orthax.
How would that would have come into play if the

1402
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:24,910
"pepperbox have stayed around?"

1403
01:34:24,910 --> 01:34:31,159
MATT: Well, for one, Ripley would never have
acquired Orthax for herself. Ripley would have

1404
01:34:31,159 --> 01:34:38,518
been stalking the party for a long time to try and
scrape what information she could off of Percy.

1405
01:34:38,518 --> 01:34:45,240
Probably trying to find some way to steal some of
his weaponry or even try to steal pepperbox while

1406
01:34:45,240 --> 01:34:51,366
it wasn't being tended to or they were sleeping.
Orthax would have begun to push for the list, for

1407
01:34:51,366 --> 01:34:56,883
completion, and would begin to have a stronger
influence on Percival. It would have been to the

1408
01:34:56,883 --> 01:35:00,780
point where certain scenarios where he would have
moral decisions to let something live that

1409
01:35:00,780 --> 01:35:09,127
was either on the list or was impeding his
progress to vengeance that he would have begun to resist the

1410
01:35:09,127 --> 01:35:19,692
will of Orthax. He may have begun to exhibit more
fiendish capabilities and being offered more

1411
01:35:19,692 --> 01:35:24,832
powers from Orthax, the more it began to consume
him from the inside. I didn't develop it too far

1412
01:35:24,832 --> 01:35:28,688
from that point, but that was the direction I
wanted to go with it based on how long it was

1413
01:35:28,688 --> 01:35:30,121
going to be around.

1414
01:35:30,121 --> 01:35:38,865
BRIAN: Wow. Do you plan on, I don't want to say
being harder on them, now that they're all gone.

1415
01:35:38,865 --> 01:35:45,306
But this time around, since they aren't as much of a
newbie as they were when they started before, do

1416
01:35:45,306 --> 01:35:50,979
you plan on stepping things up a little bit or
maybe challenging them more? Even though they're

1417
01:35:50,979 --> 01:35:55,144
going to be obviously lower leveled, they're gonna
be a little squishy. You don't want throw

1418
01:35:55,144 --> 01:36:00,017
something crazy at them. But now that they do,
with the exception of Sam, understand D&D a lot

1419
01:36:00,017 --> 01:36:04,757
better, are you going to be harder on them or
maybe a little bit more

1420
01:36:04,757 --> 01:36:06,223
challenging this time around?

1421
01:36:06,223 --> 01:36:09,442
MATT: I don't want to say harder on them, because
the point of the game is for everyone to have fun, and

1422
01:36:09,442 --> 01:36:15,672
that doesn't always mean making it harder. But
challenge them more, I'd like to. I think, the

1423
01:36:15,672 --> 01:36:20,170
area where the new campaign is happening has a lot
more social ramifications for the choices they make.

1424
01:36:20,170 --> 01:36:26,676
BRIAN: Also, no doors in this campaign. I thought
that was a great choice, this land has no doors.

1425
01:36:26,676 --> 01:36:29,683
MATT: Just archways, which will be their new villain.

1426
01:36:29,683 --> 01:36:38,948
BRIAN: Hope they don't go into Spanish villas, then,
or Hobbiton.

1427
01:36:38,948 --> 01:36:45,056
MATT: To an extent, yes. I mean, 5th edition D&D
was still new to me and them when we started

1428
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:49,205
streaming this, so there was a learning curve,
through every level I was learning the balance and

1429
01:36:49,246 --> 01:36:52,187
everything, and I've made mistakes here and there,
and I learned a lot going through the campaign.

1430
01:36:52,187 --> 01:36:57,173
Both on power levels and what makes an
interesting encounter, while also not making it so

1431
01:36:57,173 --> 01:37:00,583
hard to the point where it’s not fun. We've had
slogs and we've had battles that fall on that

1432
01:37:00,583 --> 01:37:05,128
category. But once again, that's part of the fun
of playing this live, is not everything is going to

1433
01:37:05,128 --> 01:37:10,624
be a perfect session. We're learning as you guys
watch it, that's what I hope is part of it. I

1434
01:37:10,624 --> 01:37:15,499
think so, because it's just us playing the game.
There’ll be those things. I've learned a lot from

1435
01:37:15,499 --> 01:37:20,164
it, the players have learned a lot. I feel
confident in their capabilities now of being a

1436
01:37:20,164 --> 01:37:25,207
little more tactical, of learning that not every
battle can be won, some things are more about

1437
01:37:25,207 --> 01:37:28,468
creative use of the battlefield than just running
and doing damage.

1438
01:37:28,468 --> 01:37:30,179
BRIAN: There's a lot about gods.

1439
01:37:30,179 --> 01:37:36,253
MATT: And learned a lot about preparation, and
learning what you're up against before you jump into

1440
01:37:36,253 --> 01:37:41,714
that also. And if not, they’ll learn that very
quickly. I will say it'll probably be a lot more

1441
01:37:41,714 --> 01:37:46,879
challenging. Also because, as is the nature of
D&D, once you get to the higher levels, a lot of

1442
01:37:46,879 --> 01:37:52,208
things can be circumvented easier. Death becomes
more of a nuisance to a certain extent. The lower

1443
01:37:52,208 --> 01:37:57,686
levels are definitely not that case. I'm both
excited and very scared for the new campaign.

1444
01:37:57,686 --> 01:38:04,808
We even ran our session zero with Laura, Travis,
and Marisha and in one attack, Laura's character

1445
01:38:04,808 --> 01:38:06,140
went to zero hit points.

1446
01:38:06,140 --> 01:38:07,571
BRIAN: She told me that.

1447
01:38:07,571 --> 01:38:12,868
MATT: Against a giant constrictor snake. And I
think that was a wake-up-call, as it should have

1448
01:38:12,868 --> 01:38:16,596
been. We’ll see how that plays out.

1449
01:38:16,596 --> 01:38:18,397
BRIAN: Don't show up with any weak shit.

1450
01:38:18,397 --> 01:38:20,935
MATT: Or at least just be mindful.

1451
01:38:20,935 --> 01:38:27,399
BRIAN: NuclearWhale94 wants to know-- remember
that one, from the big nuclear whale of '94.

1452
01:38:27,399 --> 01:38:28,954
MATT: Yeah, how could you forget?

1453
01:38:28,954 --> 01:38:33,688
BRIAN: I remember where I was the morning.
"Raishan was in it for a purpose, as we found out,

1454
01:38:33,688 --> 01:38:37,784
"can you elaborate on Brimscythe, Vorugal and
Umbrasyl?"

1455
01:38:37,784 --> 01:38:39,496
MATT: Most of that--

1456
01:38:39,496 --> 01:38:45,318
BRIAN: Oh wait, there's more, "Can you elaborate
on their motives and more of their characters as

1457
01:38:45,318 --> 01:38:47,321
"we barely had any time with them?"

1458
01:38:47,321 --> 01:38:59,327
MATT: I’ll try and be concise. Brimscythe loved and
had fascination with corrupting human political

1459
01:38:59,327 --> 01:39:08,208
structures, so Brimscythe had already, as General
Krieg, unrelated to the whole Conclave incident,

1460
01:39:08,208 --> 01:39:14,881
got himself ingrained in Emon's society and was
basically just digging it out from the inside.

1461
01:39:14,911 --> 01:39:19,801
That's why he had set a whole accommodation with
a home there and a lair that was not too far off.

1462
01:39:19,801 --> 01:39:29,574
Was out of just his own enjoying this degradation
that he had created. Vorugal was an animal, a very

1463
01:39:29,574 --> 01:39:35,243
powerful animal who was intelligent enough to get
by, but was more fascinated with the hunt, was the

1464
01:39:35,243 --> 01:39:42,194
thrill of the stalking and fighting. Imagine
Vorugal very similar to Akuma, from Street

1465
01:39:42,194 --> 01:39:46,759
Fighter, I guess you could say. A warrior who
is very powerful, but has no goal other than to

1466
01:39:46,759 --> 01:39:51,407
eventually find something more powerful than him to
give him a real challenge. Vorugal was very much a

1467
01:39:51,454 --> 01:39:59,097
similar mindset to that. I think Umbrasyl had been
hunted enough from lair to lair by people that

1468
01:39:59,097 --> 01:40:05,925
wanted to be rid of this black dragon scourge
that had destroyed societies to the far west, and

1469
01:40:05,968 --> 01:40:12,671
wanted an environment where he could rule without
worry of being bothered or assaulted, and

1470
01:40:12,671 --> 01:40:14,513
eventually hunted down.

1471
01:40:14,513 --> 01:40:23,603
Raishan and Thordak-- although mostly
Raishan-- brokered this idea that "If all of us

1472
01:40:23,649 --> 01:40:27,895
"work together, we can wipe out most of the
controlling society on this continent and the

1473
01:40:27,895 --> 01:40:36,121
"immediate threat of Draconia," which kept very close
tabs on a number of these members, "to just put us

1474
01:40:36,121 --> 01:40:42,684
"in a position of power, with no opposition, and we
can divvy up the land however we please, and then

1475
01:40:42,684 --> 01:40:47,505
"go about our business and help each other out when
we need to." Chromatic dragons don't work well

1476
01:40:47,505 --> 01:40:53,042
together in a long-term deal, so it was a short term
like, "we all do this together, then we all fuck

1477
01:40:53,096 --> 01:40:56,955
"off to our four corners and we rule these four
corners because we have wiped out opposition."

1478
01:40:56,955 --> 01:41:04,658
That was the whole premise there. For Brimscythe,
if he had survived, he probably would have wanted

1479
01:41:04,658 --> 01:41:09,192
Emon for himself, but Thordak-- honestly, if
Brimscythe had survived when the Conclave

1480
01:41:09,192 --> 01:41:12,847
happened, Thordak would probably have taken out
Brimscythe quietly, without the rest of the

1481
01:41:12,847 --> 01:41:17,126
Conclave knowing. They never got there so I didn't
elaborate too far on that one in the story but

1482
01:41:17,126 --> 01:41:19,586
there had been a conflict there between those
two.

1483
01:41:19,586 --> 01:41:21,001
BRIAN: That would have been cool.

1484
01:41:21,001 --> 01:41:25,188
MATT: Yeah, I mean, I can go on, but there are other
questions to get to.

1485
01:41:25,188 --> 01:41:33,153
BRIAN: Man, that Conclave arc was my favorite, I
think. Besides the one where Tary came in for a

1486
01:41:33,153 --> 01:41:34,300
little bit.

1487
01:41:34,300 --> 01:41:35,806
MATT: It's hard not to love Tary.

1488
01:41:35,806 --> 01:41:41,182
BRIAN: @LeDoomGov wants to know, "What were your
plans had Vox Machina entered the hag's house in

1489
01:41:41,182 --> 01:41:42,844
"the Shademirk Bog?"

1490
01:41:42,844 --> 01:41:50,364
MATT: Technically not a hag. They thought it was.
I think I talked about this a little on one of the

1491
01:41:50,364 --> 01:41:58,426
Talks Machinas, but this was another fey entity
that was there, that was a half-corrupted,

1492
01:41:58,426 --> 01:42:06,266
half-monstrous and half-beautiful woman. If they
had spoken to this woman-- and I can't remember

1493
01:42:06,266 --> 01:42:11,033
the name, I have it in my notes somewhere-- she
could have given them information about Saundor in

1494
01:42:11,033 --> 01:42:15,753
advance, could basically have informed them with
more history of his corruption, what his quirks

1495
01:42:15,753 --> 01:42:20,737
were, what he is seeking and would have given them
possible knowledge that could have aided them in

1496
01:42:20,737 --> 01:42:25,106
the battle, or to prevent a battle and there could
have been a fully wits-based encounter with him.

1497
01:42:25,106 --> 01:42:32,196
If they managed, after talking with her, convince
him of his own folly and that he was not righteous

1498
01:42:32,196 --> 01:42:38,428
in the actions he had taken, he may have felt so
guilty that he would have just withered away and

1499
01:42:38,428 --> 01:42:48,130
left the corruption to fade on its own without a
conflict. She was that, but she was also an

1500
01:42:48,184 --> 01:42:52,412
old-school ex of his from like a thousand years ago
and they don't like each other anymore. She was

1501
01:42:52,412 --> 01:42:59,192
excited to watch him fall, but it never happened.
It was more of an interesting social encounter

1502
01:42:59,192 --> 01:43:03,130
that if they navigated well it could have lent
more information with the coming conflict.

1503
01:43:03,130 --> 01:43:04,594
BRIAN: I can't believe you remember all this stuff.

1504
01:43:04,594 --> 01:43:06,516
MATT: I can't either. (laughter)

1505
01:43:06,516 --> 01:43:13,055
BRIAN: Myrennororunsha wants to know, "What
exactly did Jarett do that forced him to flee Marquet?"

1506
01:43:13,055 --> 01:43:20,947
MATT: Yeah, that never came up in the campaign.
Once again, I have it in my notes. Jarett was not a

1507
01:43:20,947 --> 01:43:27,512
very well-to-do individual in Ank'Harel, wasn't a
street urchin by any means, but was considered

1508
01:43:27,512 --> 01:43:39,242
probably very lower class, and had through
happenstance gotten involved with a very young girl who

1509
01:43:39,242 --> 01:43:46,432
was of a very high noble status in Ank'Harel. They
began to pursue this romance in private because,

1510
01:43:46,432 --> 01:43:53,549
from what her parents and family wanted was to
maintain a noble birthline and already had

1511
01:43:53,549 --> 01:44:01,390
suitors and I'm pretty sure had an arranged
marriage prepared for her at a certain point, and once

1512
01:44:01,390 --> 01:44:07,811
it was discovered that they had this tryst going
on for a number of months, he was going to be

1513
01:44:07,811 --> 01:44:18,110
executed. He got the hell out of there. So nothing
illegal, technically, by the heart, from the

1514
01:44:18,110 --> 01:44:22,282
family’s concern there. He got out of there
because he knew that if he made his way back there

1515
01:44:22,282 --> 01:44:26,859
it probably wouldn't end well. It had been a
while, he probably could be okay if he went back

1516
01:44:26,859 --> 01:44:29,629
and looked different enough, but you know--

1517
01:44:29,629 --> 01:44:35,865
BRIAN: It's the same reason I fled Nevada.
@ManlyBubbles would like to know, "If the party

1518
01:44:35,865 --> 01:44:41,336
"hadn't summoned the goristro to fight Vorugal,
what would the adventure to find the Spire of

1519
01:44:41,336 --> 01:44:43,430
"Conflux have looked like?"

1520
01:44:43,430 --> 01:44:46,398
MATT: Oh shit, that was a whole thing that never
happened. They would have to go to the

1521
01:44:46,398 --> 01:44:51,097
Abyss. They would have had to have gone to the Maze
of the Abyss where the goristro hailed from.

1522
01:44:51,097 --> 01:44:54,300
BRIAN: That would have been fun.

1523
01:44:54,300 --> 01:44:58,314
MATT: That would have been scary as shit because
they would have had to not just navigate the

1524
01:44:58,361 --> 01:45:02,524
maze, they would have had to navigate the maze to
get to the specific goristro that contained the

1525
01:45:02,524 --> 01:45:09,669
Spire, which would have involved them finding some
arcane means of tracking this entity, or making

1526
01:45:09,669 --> 01:45:15,030
allies in the maze that could lead them in that
direction. Let me tell you, making allies with

1527
01:45:15,030 --> 01:45:16,501
demons always turns out well.

1528
01:45:16,501 --> 01:45:19,612
BRIAN: Yeah. How do you think I got this job?

1529
01:45:19,612 --> 01:45:27,008
MATT: (laughs) Yeah. It would have been
complicated and very dangerous, so honestly, that

1530
01:45:27,008 --> 01:45:34,352
was a very inspired use of the Gate scroll. When
that item came up as a loot item, I was thinking

1531
01:45:34,352 --> 01:45:39,507
it would be-- It was one of those systems for the
DM, and I recommend this for a DM, sometimes

1532
01:45:39,507 --> 01:45:42,188
you'll throw things in your campaign and you're
like, "I don't know how or where they'll use this,

1533
01:45:42,188 --> 01:45:47,031
"but I'm sure it will be interesting whenever it
does come up." And it was their first real brush

1534
01:45:47,031 --> 01:45:52,282
with 9th-level magic. I was excited to see how
they were going to pull it out, and that was

1535
01:45:52,282 --> 01:45:53,809
pretty inspired on their end.

1536
01:45:53,809 --> 01:45:58,723
BRIAN: Heck yeah, one of those clutch
things. Speaking of Dr. Ripley from earlier,

1537
01:45:58,723 --> 01:46:04,193
CommanderClay wants to know: "What was Dr. Ripley's
plan, and what was her deal with the devil?"

1538
01:46:04,228 --> 01:46:15,636
MATT: She wasn't a major player, but she was part
of a structure of military development in

1539
01:46:15,636 --> 01:46:19,982
Rexontrum, which is the capital city of West
Wynandir of the Dwendalian Empire.

1540
01:46:20,026 --> 01:46:21,649
BRIAN: Recsyndrome.

1541
01:46:21,649 --> 01:46:32,074
MATT: Rexontrum! That'll show up in the new
campaign. She was, on a medium scale, a developer

1542
01:46:32,074 --> 01:46:40,899
of military technology. They were looking for ways
to improve their dominance of that region.

1543
01:46:40,899 --> 01:46:43,864
BRIAN: She was a Justin Hammer!

1544
01:46:43,864 --> 01:46:49,323
MATT: Kind of! But a little more of a
Goebbels, I guess you could say. She was looking

1545
01:46:49,323 --> 01:46:56,681
into, at the time, more arcane diseases and
things that could be a chemical-warfare type

1546
01:46:56,681 --> 01:47:02,652
of basis that was technically illegal at the time
and was using human experimentation, unknown. When

1547
01:47:02,652 --> 01:47:08,097
she was discovered, she was about to be tried for
it, and so she fled. But in part of that process, she

1548
01:47:08,280 --> 01:47:18,696
probably figured out that there was some bad blood
between her and King Bertrand Dwendal, which is

1549
01:47:18,696 --> 01:47:22,142
why he was on her list. And a number of
individuals on her list were people--

1550
01:47:22,180 --> 01:47:23,933
BRIAN: Yeah, we had another question, who were the
people on Ripley's list?

1551
01:47:23,933 --> 01:47:27,756
MATT: I don't remember off the top of my head, but
all these people were all individuals she worked

1552
01:47:27,756 --> 01:47:36,288
with that were responsible for turning her in to
the crown and getting her placed on a list for

1553
01:47:36,288 --> 01:47:44,333
trial. She had some small-level magic as a lot of
the higher-level members of Rexontrum and that

1554
01:47:44,333 --> 01:47:51,660
area do and utilized what she had to escape and
fled out of the kingdom over to the Menagerie

1555
01:47:51,660 --> 01:47:57,240
Coast at Port Damali, and that's where she met the
other fugitives, the Briarwoods. They had this

1556
01:47:57,240 --> 01:48:02,180
unification of ideals and decided their purpose
was to "Let's work together and see where this can

1557
01:48:02,180 --> 01:48:10,436
"take us!" So that was that, and as far as her
plans with Orthax, it was just her now fascinated

1558
01:48:10,436 --> 01:48:18,400
with this new technology that she saw a lot of
uses, and as this was the source of it, it seemed.

1559
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:22,469
What secrets did it not tell Percy yet, what was
it holding back? And if she embraced this entity,

1560
01:48:22,469 --> 01:48:27,742
what more could she learn from it that Percival
would never, his moral code, allow him

1561
01:48:27,742 --> 01:48:32,594
to make the sacrifice for? She was driven a little
mad by that pursuit at that time.

1562
01:48:32,594 --> 01:48:39,571
BRIAN: One of the best NPC/PC emotional
tug-of-wars, sinister--

1563
01:48:39,571 --> 01:48:43,901
MATT: Oh man, I loved it! I was sad that she died
in that battle. I knew it was probably going to

1564
01:48:43,901 --> 01:48:46,640
happen, but I was hoping she would be a fun one
to string along for a while and just

1565
01:48:46,684 --> 01:48:47,935
be a recurring villain.

1566
01:48:47,935 --> 01:48:50,324
BRIAN: Maybe there will be a version of her in the
next campaign.

1567
01:48:50,324 --> 01:48:51,670
MATT: She almost got away!

1568
01:48:51,670 --> 01:49:00,321
BRIAN: Yeah, just like Ash. Hakumen Narukami wants
to know: "What would have happened if Vex couldn't

1569
01:49:00,321 --> 01:49:05,290
"find the grey render or if it had escaped?"
Anything would have happened there?

1570
01:49:05,290 --> 01:49:06,861
MATT: Technically it escaped.

1571
01:49:06,861 --> 01:49:08,600
BRIAN: Ran away, right?

1572
01:49:08,600 --> 01:49:12,621
MATT: She wasn't able to necessarily charm it to
her, and if she had been able to succeed to

1573
01:49:12,621 --> 01:49:18,902
convince it, the grey render would have bound
itself to her. Grey renders do that. Sometimes

1574
01:49:18,902 --> 01:49:23,430
they will pick an entity or a location they bind
themselves to and will protect it at all costs. So the

1575
01:49:23,430 --> 01:49:30,410
grey render would have become a force of nature
that whenever she was in the area of Whitestone

1576
01:49:30,410 --> 01:49:36,506
would protect Vex from the shadows and then
continue to protect her bloodline. So any

1577
01:49:36,506 --> 01:49:40,273
children she would have had, it would become the
protector of the family. She didn't succeed at

1578
01:49:40,273 --> 01:49:47,159
that, so instead it just continues to wander the
Parchwood around Whitestone, watching over its

1579
01:49:47,159 --> 01:49:55,083
young. So she did miss that opportunity, but
that's fine, it happens in D&D, not everything is

1580
01:49:55,083 --> 01:49:59,273
a success. Yeah, that's kind of it.

1581
01:49:59,273 --> 01:50:05,671
BRIAN: Interesting! Speaking of the last Fireside
Chat that you did, Brooke Casey says, "When the

1582
01:50:05,671 --> 01:50:11,427
"assassin created from the Fireside Chat was made
into a baker, was it pure serendipity that Vox

1583
01:50:11,427 --> 01:50:16,936
"Machina in the downtime had founded the Slayer's
Cake? Or had you influenced that at all? If they

1584
01:50:16,936 --> 01:50:19,412
"hadn't, how would she have been added?"

1585
01:50:19,412 --> 01:50:25,112
MATT: No, that was completely by a serendipitous
scenario. They hadn't even told me their intention

1586
01:50:25,112 --> 01:50:31,144
over the break to develop this, the Slayer's Cake,
at the time. It was the whole chat trying to be

1587
01:50:31,144 --> 01:50:37,610
ridiculous and trying to get me to create an NPC
called Troy Baker. That's where it came from.

1588
01:50:37,610 --> 01:50:40,967
BRIAN: Named after the video game voice actor Troy
Baker?

1589
01:50:40,967 --> 01:50:42,542
MATT: No. Named after the--

1590
01:50:42,542 --> 01:50:43,951
BRIAN: Oh, the guy from Deadliest Catch?

1591
01:50:43,951 --> 01:50:45,028
MATT: Yeah, exactly.

1592
01:50:45,028 --> 01:50:47,105
BRIAN: The game about football, Deadliest Catch.

1593
01:50:47,105 --> 01:50:48,087
MATT: Yeah, that one.

1594
01:50:48,087 --> 01:50:51,269
BRIAN: Yeah. It's like Death Race, except they
play football.

1595
01:50:51,269 --> 01:51:00,335
MATT: I would watch so much more football. Or any.
(laughs) It was purely a chat-based joke on trying

1596
01:51:00,335 --> 01:51:04,647
to get me to name an NPC Troy Baker. I was like,
"All right, it's a baker. Fine. It's a baker. I

1597
01:51:04,647 --> 01:51:08,763
"give you that." And then when they did the
Slayer's Cake, because I was trying to think how

1598
01:51:08,763 --> 01:51:12,383
the assassin was going to ingrain themselves into
the story. And that was the perfect in and I'm

1599
01:51:12,383 --> 01:51:16,963
like, "Well, thank you for solving a problem I
hadn't come up with an answer for yet. Fuck yeah."

1600
01:51:16,963 --> 01:51:24,999
BRIAN: Okay, last few here we've got for you.
Repete17, "Was there a way to avoid the fight with the

1601
01:51:24,999 --> 01:51:28,308
"gigantic forge guardian at the core anvil?"

1602
01:51:28,308 --> 01:51:37,288
MATT: Oh, right! There would have been if they had
brought any materials to craft or create something

1603
01:51:37,288 --> 01:51:38,632
using the anvil.

1604
01:51:38,632 --> 01:51:40,324
BRIAN: That was the trick?

1605
01:51:40,324 --> 01:51:48,211
MATT: As part of the worship to the Allhammer
that this location maintained, since the Allhammer

1606
01:51:48,211 --> 01:51:53,153
no longer exists on this plane, it would be to
create and craft something on the anvil and leave

1607
01:51:53,153 --> 01:51:58,224
it as an offering to the Forge Guardian and the
Allhammer's memory. So if they had brought

1608
01:51:58,224 --> 01:52:03,919
anything, whether it had been any of the raw ore
that they had found in previous rooms, and crafted

1609
01:52:03,919 --> 01:52:12,885
something that was deemed a worthy gift, then they
wouldn't have had to worry about the actual

1610
01:52:12,885 --> 01:52:18,218
encounter with the Forge Guardian. But, once
again, D&D!

1611
01:52:18,218 --> 01:52:23,179
BRIAN: Yeah, exactly. TCOblivion. "Is Devo'ssa's
cover story permanently blown now?"

1612
01:52:23,179 --> 01:52:34,590
MATT: Devo'ssa's cover story with the people of
Ank'Harel, no. Devo'ssa's cover extends to the

1613
01:52:34,590 --> 01:52:40,871
general populace. But to mainstream leaders in
other parts of the world that have had to work

1614
01:52:40,871 --> 01:52:49,234
directly with J'mon Sa Ord and their presence in
recent events, I don't think has blown any of the

1615
01:52:49,234 --> 01:52:55,114
cover there. And they're all very well aware of
J'mon's necessity to keep such things under wraps.

1616
01:52:55,114 --> 01:52:59,064
I'm sure rumors will spread, but rumors have
always spread. And whenever a rumor has gotten

1617
01:52:59,064 --> 01:53:03,935
close to J'mon's existence, they've been very
conscious to disseminate other rumors that would

1618
01:53:03,935 --> 01:53:11,355
just clutter and cloud that same space. Almost
like our current political structure. I'm not too

1619
01:53:11,355 --> 01:53:17,497
terribly worried about it. For hundreds of years
there have been theories that J'mon is a dragon.

1620
01:53:17,497 --> 01:53:22,454
But there have also been theories that J'mon is a
number of people that just pass through like an

1621
01:53:22,454 --> 01:53:28,444
office. Like the Dread Pirate Roberts. Or that
it's an alien entity from another plane that lives

1622
01:53:28,444 --> 01:53:30,358
forever. There's been a lot of rumors.

1623
01:53:30,358 --> 01:53:32,847
BRIAN: Or the Saint. The popular Val Kilmer film.

1624
01:53:32,847 --> 01:53:37,818
MATT: It's the film. It's an actual boxed DVD as
the leader of Ank'Harel.

1625
01:53:37,818 --> 01:53:41,770
BRIAN: Dani just started typing up her letter of
resignation after that joke.

1626
01:53:41,770 --> 01:53:45,059
MATT: Good job.

1627
01:53:45,059 --> 01:53:50,118
BRIAN: "Was Dr. Dranzel just looking to make a
score? Or as a leader of the Golden Grin, did he

1628
01:53:50,118 --> 01:53:54,944
"have other motive for sending Vox Machina back to
General Krieg's house?" This question’s also from

1629
01:53:54,944 --> 01:53:56,166
(mumbled).

1630
01:53:56,166 --> 01:54:00,504
MATT: That was purely out of need for money. Dr.
Dranzel is not a leader of the Golden Grin, just a

1631
01:54:00,504 --> 01:54:05,873
member. And it's a very well-hidden fact on his
end. Only those who keenly paid attention to the

1632
01:54:05,873 --> 01:54:08,406
campaign guide would have noticed that.

1633
01:54:08,446 --> 01:54:11,104
BRIAN: Few, I'm sure. Knowing this community.

1634
01:54:11,104 --> 01:54:22,182
MATT: I'm sure many. Dr. Dranzel is all about, as
is the Golden Grin, uplifting the underdog and

1635
01:54:22,182 --> 01:54:30,424
protectors of good in society. And Dranzel does so
whenever the opportunity arises. He's kind of a

1636
01:54:30,424 --> 01:54:38,686
passive member. More active in his youth. But that
whole element was just basically going, "Hey, so

1637
01:54:38,686 --> 01:54:43,313
"we need some cash. And I hear there's some things
that are pretty pricey that no one's watching

1638
01:54:43,313 --> 01:54:45,762
"over. Want to go get some?"

1639
01:54:45,762 --> 01:54:56,469
BRIAN: How much do, if at all, real events impact
any of the storytelling that you do? I think

1640
01:54:56,469 --> 01:54:59,763
about how David Milch talks about how George
Hearst in the third season of Deadwood is to

1641
01:54:59,763 --> 01:55:09,938
represent capitalism coming to America, 1876,
right? The forerunner for capitalism would be a

1642
01:55:09,938 --> 01:55:15,178
serial killer in the form of Garret Dillahunt's
character. So thinking about the campaign, do you

1643
01:55:15,178 --> 01:55:25,185
find that what happens in the world, whether it be
the injustices or our successes in any current

1644
01:55:25,185 --> 01:55:32,214
shape find its way into the story? Is it hard
to ignore what's going on in the real world?

1645
01:55:32,214 --> 01:55:37,896
Because so many of us look at this game as a way
to sometimes escape. You know. I'm not a big

1646
01:55:37,896 --> 01:55:44,299
escapism person, but for four hours to just go like, "This
will bring me to a place of happiness."

1647
01:55:44,299 --> 01:55:49,198
MATT: It's an interesting point. I would say I
don't tailor my stories to reflect the world, but I'd

1648
01:55:49,198 --> 01:55:52,293
imagine, subconsciously, it's hard to avoid it,
too.

1649
01:55:52,293 --> 01:55:54,130
BRIAN: It's hard to not be impacted by it.

1650
01:55:54,130 --> 01:55:58,267
MATT: The world is filled with so much variety of
conflict that no matter what you create in the story

1651
01:55:58,267 --> 01:56:03,458
that has conflict, there's going to be parallels.
Whatever is close to you is going to lead its way

1652
01:56:03,488 --> 01:56:06,886
in some way shape or form into the work that
you're doing. It's not just writing, or writing

1653
01:56:06,886 --> 01:56:10,989
especially, a lot things that you do, they just
find their way in. I think in hindsight there were

1654
01:56:10,989 --> 01:56:16,432
elements in the campaign that I'm sure were, you
know, things bleeding over. This upcoming campaign,

1655
01:56:16,432 --> 01:56:19,304
just in the way I've built the world I'm sure
there's been a lot that's bled into it as well.

1656
01:56:19,304 --> 01:56:23,743
There'll be parallels. And you want to tell
stories. For some people it's escapism. For other

1657
01:56:23,743 --> 01:56:29,526
people I think it's a therapeutic way of dealing
with the injustices of the world. I'm not trying

1658
01:56:29,526 --> 01:56:32,597
to show an example of a perfect world. I'm not
trying to be like, the world sucks out there so

1659
01:56:32,597 --> 01:56:35,711
come to our place where everything's great! I'm
like, the world there sucks. Come to this world

1660
01:56:35,711 --> 01:56:39,504
where some things do suck but people are standing
up and making a difference. People are trying to

1661
01:56:39,504 --> 01:56:43,742
actively make the sacrifices that are necessary
and stand up and be heroes in the face of

1662
01:56:43,742 --> 01:56:49,144
injustice and probable loss because somebody needs
to. And that's the tale I want to tell. I don't

1663
01:56:49,144 --> 01:56:54,577
want to inspire people to ignore the
darkness and find a safe space. There is an

1664
01:56:54,577 --> 01:56:58,820
element of that. But I think in that space you can
also teach people the importance of standing up

1665
01:56:58,820 --> 01:57:03,567
for what's fucked up in the world around you and
in what small way you can contribute to changing

1666
01:57:03,567 --> 01:57:07,910
the things you're unhappy with. I think we've seen
a lot of that in the community. We've seen a lot

1667
01:57:07,910 --> 01:57:13,319
of that in storytelling in recent years in
general. The good stories come from people that

1668
01:57:13,319 --> 01:57:16,802
are frustrated with the world and want to make a
difference and the only way they can is with a pen

1669
01:57:16,802 --> 01:57:18,219
and pencil.

1670
01:57:18,219 --> 01:57:22,224
BRIAN: That's true. That's a great sentiment.
What's the hardest thing for you to write?

1671
01:57:22,224 --> 01:57:31,603
MATT: Oh man! That's an interesting question.

1672
01:57:31,603 --> 01:57:38,010
BRIAN: Are you struggling with anything right now
that you're just like, "It's not coming together"?

1673
01:57:38,010 --> 01:57:42,962
MATT: Strangely, no. It's coming together. But
it's been a lot of months of percolating ideas and

1674
01:57:42,962 --> 01:57:44,243
throwing things down.

1675
01:57:44,243 --> 01:57:45,878
BRIAN: You've had some practice.

1676
01:57:45,878 --> 01:57:52,802
MATT: I think the hardest thing for me is
outlining enough faction perspectives to flesh out

1677
01:57:52,802 --> 01:57:57,105
a world but not have everyone feel like they're
constantly at war. If that makes sense. We have

1678
01:57:57,105 --> 01:58:04,171
all these various societies and factions that all
have conflicting ideals and interests. However,

1679
01:58:04,171 --> 01:58:10,383
they're not always battling. For me, it's a
conscious development choice to find ways in which

1680
01:58:10,383 --> 01:58:14,559
they have to coexist. Or find ways in which they
have to agree not to--

1681
01:58:14,559 --> 01:58:17,502
BRIAN: A trade deal or a thing, yeah.

1682
01:58:17,502 --> 01:58:22,328
MATT: Right. You know, with a long term idea of
how to do I take you in the end. Or the

1683
01:58:22,328 --> 01:58:26,111
mutual destruction type idea. Of like, you know,
well if we both do go to war we both will probably

1684
01:58:26,111 --> 01:58:31,883
kill each other. Let's best just hold this tension
for now, we'll table this at the moment and come

1685
01:58:31,883 --> 01:58:35,400
back to it later. History is a great source of
these stories. You look at the history of

1686
01:58:35,400 --> 01:58:38,097
humanity-- If you ever want to run a game and you
want to get something a little more interesting

1687
01:58:38,097 --> 01:58:42,091
and political, read history. I know it may have
sucked when you were in high school, but I

1688
01:58:42,091 --> 01:58:46,010
guarantee the older you get the more interesting
history is, and there is some fascinating history

1689
01:58:46,010 --> 01:58:48,063
in human civilization around the world.

1690
01:58:48,063 --> 01:58:51,434
BRIAN: Or just watch a bunch of Eddie Izzard
specials.

1691
01:58:51,434 --> 01:58:57,246
MATT: That too! Honestly, yes. So yeah. That's about
as elaborate as I can get on the topic before

1692
01:58:57,246 --> 01:58:58,868
rambling and boring you all.

1693
01:58:58,868 --> 01:59:03,682
BRIAN: Yeah, I get it. I'm just sneaking in a few
of my own questions here because I'm selfish. Did

1694
01:59:03,682 --> 01:59:09,974
you have alternative plans for Craven Edge if
Percy hadn't picked it up and given it to Grog?

1695
01:59:09,974 --> 01:59:16,412
MATT: No. It was just going to be a weapon that
was left behind and would have probably gone into

1696
01:59:16,412 --> 01:59:23,786
some archive somewhere. I expected it may have
been found, but also as you've seen in a lot of

1697
01:59:23,786 --> 01:59:30,488
battles sometimes, in the throes of a very
emotional sequence, loot will be forgotten. Or I

1698
01:59:30,488 --> 01:59:34,811
expected somebody to pick it up, somebody who
wasn't Percy, and be like, "This doesn't look good.

1699
01:59:34,811 --> 01:59:38,642
"Let me go ahead and find somebody who can identify
it." And be like, "Oh, this is bad!" and be like,

1700
01:59:38,642 --> 01:59:46,078
"Fuck this," and throw it away. That was the more
probable thing, but much like Grog finding the

1701
01:59:46,078 --> 01:59:50,783
Deck of Many Things, sometimes the people you
don't expect are the first to find the loot.

1702
01:59:50,783 --> 01:59:52,958
BRIAN: That changed the game.

1703
01:59:52,958 --> 01:59:58,088
MATT: I was like, if anybody finds the Deck,
except for Grog, they'll probably be okay.

1704
01:59:58,088 --> 02:00:06,409
BRIAN: Uh-oh. I know, yeah. And it being Travis,
too. VinceK42 says, "So the party was about one

1705
02:00:06,409 --> 02:00:12,686
"roll/decision away from never discovering Tyriok,
the mapmaker, in his petrified form."

1706
02:00:12,686 --> 02:00:14,003
MATT: Oh, right!

1707
02:00:14,003 --> 02:00:19,450
BRIAN: "How many dead or permanently incapacitated
NPCs who Vox Machina just missed are there?"

1708
02:00:19,450 --> 02:00:20,728
MATT: (laughs)

1709
02:00:20,728 --> 02:00:22,942
BRIAN: That happen a lot?

1710
02:00:22,942 --> 02:00:25,442
MATT: Not a lot, because not--

1711
02:00:25,442 --> 02:00:27,391
BRIAN: Am I showing nipple? Are we okay?

1712
02:00:27,391 --> 02:00:28,866
MATT: Oh, don't cover up!

1713
02:00:28,866 --> 02:00:33,814
BRIAN: Okay. Well, we're going to get banned on
Twitch. They told me as much. Sorry.

1714
02:00:33,814 --> 02:00:41,439
MATT: I mean, recurring NPCs? Not many, because
either they stay in places that are safe, or they

1715
02:00:41,439 --> 02:00:51,169
encountered them. Gilmore during the Chroma Fall,
when the Conclave attacked Emon; Tyriok; their

1716
02:00:51,169 --> 02:01:07,207
friends when they were going up Entropis at the
end. If they had not managed to protect or deflect

1717
02:01:07,207 --> 02:01:13,268
Vorugal's flyover of Whitestone, when they had put
up the illusionary barrier and his return from

1718
02:01:13,268 --> 02:01:19,477
Draconia, there could've been some bad stuff there,
because he wouldn’t have attacked then. He

1719
02:01:19,477 --> 02:01:24,701
would've flown up or pretended it wasn't there and then
come back later on with probably two other members

1720
02:01:24,701 --> 02:01:28,323
of the Conclave and wiped out a lot of Whitestone,
and that would've been bad.

1721
02:01:28,323 --> 02:01:29,880
BRIAN: Yeah.

1722
02:01:29,880 --> 02:01:35,639
MATT: It's not too often because I don't want them
to continuously meet NPCs they've already met.

1723
02:01:35,639 --> 02:01:39,740
There's probably NPCs they never met that probably
died off-screen that they never encountered.

1724
02:01:39,740 --> 02:01:42,476
BRIAN: Or ones that got killed within one line of
dialogue.

1725
02:01:42,476 --> 02:01:45,140
MATT: Or there was that, yeah.

1726
02:01:45,140 --> 02:01:52,188
BRIAN: That was hilarious. Gavrock wants to know,
"How are Shale and the Herd of Storms doing

1727
02:01:52,188 --> 02:01:54,186
"following the fall of Umbrasyl?"

1728
02:01:54,186 --> 02:02:00,499
MATT: The Herd of Storms, which technically is no
longer called the Herd of Storms at this point,

1729
02:02:00,499 --> 02:02:07,478
although the stigma around the title is a bit
rough, they're doing all right. They're

1730
02:02:07,478 --> 02:02:13,517
rebuilding, they're taking a little more of a
peaceful trade and interacting with local society

1731
02:02:13,517 --> 02:02:21,725
for goods and then staying to nature. A less
dominant Kevdak-style of conquer, take, and ruin.

1732
02:02:21,725 --> 02:02:30,934
Shale is not around anymore. Shale, according to
Chris Perkins, and I'm not going to rob him of his

1733
02:02:30,934 --> 02:02:36,470
character's end, probably fell down the mountain
shortly after that battle and died alone somewhere

1734
02:02:36,470 --> 02:02:44,095
in the Cliffkeep. By his own words! But Shale had
done well, and she had lived a good life up to

1735
02:02:44,095 --> 02:02:45,908
that point and contributed.

1736
02:02:45,908 --> 02:02:48,911
BRIAN: That's crazy.

1737
02:02:48,911 --> 02:02:49,868
MATT: Go Shale.

1738
02:02:49,868 --> 02:02:51,100
BRIAN: Go Shale. I know you're watching, Chris.

1739
02:02:51,100 --> 02:02:52,188
MATT: Drink to Shale.

1740
02:02:52,188 --> 02:02:57,824
BRIAN: I know you're watching, Christopher.
MetallicaGross wants to know-- Chris, you agree

1741
02:02:57,824 --> 02:02:59,157
with that?

1742
02:02:59,157 --> 02:03:00,791
CHRIS: I'm a Megadeth fan.

1743
02:03:00,791 --> 02:03:05,703
BRIAN: Oh, he's a Megadeth fan. I like Megadeth.
"Matt, was there any exciting backstory,

1744
02:03:05,703 --> 02:03:13,470
"sidequests, lore, or loot tied to that ship in
Vorugal's lair?" Was that anything?

1745
02:03:13,470 --> 02:03:16,950
MATT: The party put a lot more to that boat than
there was.

1746
02:03:16,950 --> 02:03:20,940
BRIAN: Okay. So it was one of those things like
Senokir's box where it was like, obsessed with it

1747
02:03:20,940 --> 02:03:22,189
but it was okay.

1748
02:03:22,189 --> 02:03:30,657
MATT: Yeah. Vorugal, who had just relocated to
make the ruins of Draconia their nest then began

1749
02:03:30,657 --> 02:03:35,381
to amass what goods were nearby, and so began to
do flyovers of nearby villages and civilizations

1750
02:03:35,381 --> 02:03:39,401
and grab whatever was there, kill whoever was
present, and take it back and began to build a

1751
02:03:39,401 --> 02:03:44,996
new hoard, and one of the things happened to be a
ship that was out in the ocean that Vorugal

1752
02:03:44,996 --> 02:03:49,574
destroyed partially and then took the rest of it
back and then began to sift through what was

1753
02:03:49,574 --> 02:03:55,146
inside, and over time began to freeze over. There
was nothing too special in there, I would have

1754
02:03:55,146 --> 02:04:00,012
rolled up some random magical items for it. I did
have some random items rolled up for it, but

1755
02:04:00,012 --> 02:04:03,793
nothing too crazy. But that's also one of the
things I love about being a DM, is you can

1756
02:04:03,793 --> 02:04:12,211
convince the party unintentionally of all the
possible intents, story-based mystery about a

1757
02:04:12,211 --> 02:04:15,337
scenario that literally is just a broken ship.

1758
02:04:15,337 --> 02:04:18,321
BRIAN: Yeah. That's kind of what happened on Lost,
too.

1759
02:04:18,321 --> 02:04:19,703
MATT: Yeah.

1760
02:04:20,225 --> 02:04:24,936
BRIAN: You know what I'm talking about? (sigh)
That ship. At least they killed the guy in there.

1761
02:04:24,936 --> 02:04:30,409
Hey, Ellie A. O'Neil wants to know, "What were the
specific triggers for the Vestiges awakening," did

1762
02:04:30,409 --> 02:04:35,479
we talk about that already? "and were there any
awakenings we didn't get to see?"

1763
02:04:35,479 --> 02:04:41,014
MATT: I largely prefer, and I put this in the
campaign guide a little bit for those who want to

1764
02:04:41,014 --> 02:04:48,798
use it, I prefer the Vestiges awakening at moments
of either heavy character development,

1765
02:04:48,798 --> 02:04:56,710
advancement, or a crux for their flaws or bonds,
if you run those systems, or something that is so

1766
02:04:56,710 --> 02:05:04,666
out of character and them embracing a level of
adventurous heroism they wouldn't otherwise.

1767
02:05:04,666 --> 02:05:08,917
Essentially, whenever you as the GM or the
director of the game goes, oh man, this would be a

1768
02:05:08,917 --> 02:05:13,607
fucking cool moment for this to awaken, you know?
When the player surprises you with something,

1769
02:05:13,607 --> 02:05:18,709
you're like, well, that's enough for this thing to
start glowing and get more awesome. You know, I

1770
02:05:18,709 --> 02:05:24,827
wanted to leave it kind of vague because to me
it's up to you to find those moments. All of the

1771
02:05:24,827 --> 02:05:30,257
Vestiges, I'm pretty sure, exalted in the
campaign, but not everything they found was

1772
02:05:30,606 --> 02:05:34,940
dormant when they found it, and this because I
didn't want people at higher levels getting

1773
02:05:34,940 --> 02:05:38,925
towards the end of the campaign comparably to have
to get a dormant item and be like, oh, I have to

1774
02:05:38,925 --> 02:05:43,706
awaken it and then I have to exalt it necessarily.
I wanted it to be at certain levels, so I built in

1775
02:05:43,706 --> 02:05:51,799
a system where if a Vestige is unattuned or unused
for a long time it slowly reverts back to its

1776
02:05:51,799 --> 02:05:58,116
dormant state. Some of them may have been already
awakened when they found them, but hadn't been

1777
02:05:58,438 --> 02:06:04,403
exalted yet and hadn't quite fully regressed yet.
So, that was my way of dealing with that scenario.

1778
02:06:04,403 --> 02:06:07,654
BRIAN: Yeah. So, you're saying for people who want
to do it in their own campaign, sort of

1779
02:06:07,654 --> 02:06:13,334
case-by-case it because if you pick it out
yourself, you maybe rob yourself of a moment where

1780
02:06:13,334 --> 02:06:16,660
the player does something that makes you go, oh,
that's it.

1781
02:06:16,660 --> 02:06:21,329
MATT: Yeah. I mean, you could do it. You could be
like, when they kill their 20th creature or when

1782
02:06:21,329 --> 02:06:26,313
they use this feature X number of times. Those are
totally viable ways to do it. I think I have a

1783
02:06:26,313 --> 02:06:31,566
suggestion of that in the campaign guide. But for
me, it's more fun to wait for those heroic moments

1784
02:06:31,566 --> 02:06:34,930
when a player surprises you and their party
members and does something really cool, really in

1785
02:06:34,930 --> 02:06:41,369
or out of character, or really elevates the
narrative in a way you aren't expecting, and you're

1786
02:06:41,426 --> 02:06:46,184
like, this is the moment where I reward you for
that awesome moment with your Vestige reaching the

1787
02:06:46,184 --> 02:06:47,160
next stage.

1788
02:06:47,160 --> 02:06:55,192
BRIAN: Yeah. Wow. Okay. Pretty cool. TheFoxyKarama
wants to know, "Would it have been possible for

1789
02:06:55,192 --> 02:06:58,321
Vex to call upon the help of Galdric," Galdric, right?

1790
02:06:58,321 --> 02:06:59,058
MATT: Yeah.

1791
02:06:59,058 --> 02:07:03,719
BRIAN: "--of Galdric while performing the trial to
become Mistress of the Grey Hunt?"

1792
02:07:03,719 --> 02:07:04,693
MATT: Yeah, totally.

1793
02:07:04,693 --> 02:07:05,569
BRIAN: Okay.

1794
02:07:05,569 --> 02:07:12,262
MATT: Yeah, that was totally an option. Galdric is
one of the the, since being assigned by Vax, now

1795
02:07:12,262 --> 02:07:18,678
is this perpetual guardian up until the end of his
life of the surrounding Whitestone scenario, and

1796
02:07:18,678 --> 02:07:27,397
has been through years of being kept inside the
necklace and through blessings of the Raven Queen,

1797
02:07:27,397 --> 02:07:33,321
probably has a much more prolonged life than a
regular wolf would. So Galdric will be around for

1798
02:07:33,321 --> 02:07:38,164
quite a while to keep watch on the woods. And if
Vex decided to go call upon him, then yeah, totally.

1799
02:07:38,164 --> 02:07:44,086
BRIAN: Wow. Okay. Good to know. If this character
doesn't work out, she can go start her own thing

1800
02:07:44,086 --> 02:07:45,150
with Vex.

1801
02:07:45,150 --> 02:07:46,984
MATT: (laughter) Exactly. There you go. Perfect!

1802
02:07:46,984 --> 02:07:48,796
BRIAN: ForsakenGrundle-- come on.

1803
02:07:48,796 --> 02:07:50,770
MATT: Still one of the best!

1804
02:07:50,770 --> 02:07:55,880
BRIAN: Just right below my beloved ArseQueef.
"What happened to the new

1805
02:07:55,880 --> 02:08:00,138
Lord of the Quadroads/ Crossroads?"

1806
02:08:00,138 --> 02:08:05,884
MATT: Oh! The one who was given the wishes by
Grog? Well, like most people that suddenly come

1807
02:08:05,884 --> 02:08:13,028
into a lot of money, spent a lot of it. He's well
established, he's living fine. He didn't have a

1808
02:08:13,028 --> 02:08:17,957
lot of aspirations with his Wish spells, other
than more money, nice house. He's probably still

1809
02:08:17,957 --> 02:08:29,654
holding onto his last Wish. Probably. Yeah. So
with the influx of money-- he's not super high

1810
02:08:29,654 --> 02:08:33,631
level, you couldn't wish for an exorbitant amount
of money to the point where he's the richest

1811
02:08:33,631 --> 02:08:40,592
person in Vasselheim. But he went from squalor to
a very comfortable, mid to high level nobility and

1812
02:08:40,592 --> 02:08:48,605
title and everything with the Wish. He's doing all
right. But I think he's also tortured of what his

1813
02:08:48,605 --> 02:08:51,329
final Wish is going to be and probably will never
use it. Probably live the rest of his life unsure

1814
02:08:51,329 --> 02:08:56,497
of what it should and then will probably die not
knowing what it is.

1815
02:08:56,497 --> 02:09:01,495
BRIAN: Wow. That's crazy. Last question.

1816
02:09:01,495 --> 02:09:02,684
MATT: Oh shit!

1817
02:09:02,684 --> 02:09:06,996
BRIAN: Minafae wants to know, "What is the
relationship history between J'mon and Gilmore?

1818
02:09:06,996 --> 02:09:11,276
They were having a pretty in-depth conversation
after that Thordak fight."

1819
02:09:11,276 --> 02:09:16,013
MATT: There's no history between the two. They
hadn't met before that. I think it was more

1820
02:09:16,013 --> 02:09:22,789
Gilmore realizing the opportunity to talk to what
is one of the most mysterious, prestigious figures

1821
02:09:22,789 --> 02:09:27,637
of his entire upbringing and culture. It was this
opportunity for Gilmore to be like, "Oh, Mr.

1822
02:09:27,637 --> 02:09:32,263
President. Let me shake your hand. And I've always
wondered, what are your thoughts on this, and what

1823
02:09:32,263 --> 02:09:38,296
are your thoughts on that?" I think it was less
J'mon being interested in Gilmore, although happy

1824
02:09:38,296 --> 02:09:42,014
to answer any questions that he has, I think it
was Gilmore more being interested in what they

1825
02:09:42,014 --> 02:09:51,012
were and what they had to say and just taking this
one opportunity to shake hands with this majestic

1826
02:09:51,012 --> 02:09:56,082
entity that would probably never happen again. So,
that was that. There wasn't a long history, it was

1827
02:09:56,082 --> 02:10:01,147
more Gilmore being like, "While you're here, can I
take a selfie?" That kind of feel.

1828
02:10:01,147 --> 02:10:08,861
BRIAN: Yeah. That's what our friend Chris did when
he saw Maynard from Tool at LAX.

1829
02:10:08,861 --> 02:10:14,409
MATT: Don't blame me. I will say on that part,
there's been a lot of questions about it. Gilmore

1830
02:10:14,409 --> 02:10:22,458
is fine. Gilmore is happy. Gilmore has, through
the years, developed his business on a scale that

1831
02:10:22,458 --> 02:10:33,003
isn't too fast and too expansive. Has found love,
lost love, found love again. Gilmore is happy. So

1832
02:10:33,003 --> 02:10:35,096
take that with you.

1833
02:10:35,096 --> 02:10:40,657
BRIAN: That's good to know. Has he ever gone into
a full beautiful delicious beard? I know mine was

1834
02:10:40,825 --> 02:10:43,149
trimmed recently.

1835
02:10:43,149 --> 02:10:47,867
MATT: Later in life maybe. But I think Gilmore
loves the fabulous jawline too much.

1836
02:10:47,867 --> 02:10:55,646
BRIAN: Yeah, he wants to show off the jawline. As
we wind down here and we've been thinking and

1837
02:10:55,646 --> 02:11:01,514
talking as much as we can, or as much as we want
to about the new campaign. I want to say as a

1838
02:11:01,514 --> 02:11:08,323
Critter and as a fan of the show, I think that
there's a lot of speculation on the internet.

1839
02:11:08,323 --> 02:11:17,254
There's a lot of the discussion thread on Reddit
about the new campaign is at some astronomical

1840
02:11:17,254 --> 02:11:27,634
number of comments and theory and everything.
Expectations being whatever they are, they're

1841
02:11:27,634 --> 02:11:35,279
going to range across the community if you were to
do a survey, which I don't recommend. I want to

1842
02:11:35,279 --> 02:11:44,658
say on behalf of anyone who feels this way, that
my only expectation going into this, and I hope

1843
02:11:44,658 --> 02:11:51,935
this in some way relieves any of that pressure. My
expectations going into the next campaign is

1844
02:11:51,935 --> 02:11:58,602
Thursday night I'm going to turn on Twitch. I'm
gonna be two drinks in already, but I'm gonna turn

1845
02:11:58,602 --> 02:12:05,863
on Twitch at 7:00 and I hope to just see a bunch
nerdy ass voice actors playing D&D.

1846
02:12:05,863 --> 02:12:07,883
MATT: That's the best I could hope for.

1847
02:12:07,883 --> 02:12:13,526
BRIAN: Yeah, and I just think like, I know there's
a lot of pressure. I know there must be, with the

1848
02:12:13,526 --> 02:12:20,482
success of the show especially after Talks Machina
came along. Before, I mean it was dead in the

1849
02:12:20,482 --> 02:12:22,485
water, let's admit.

1850
02:12:22,485 --> 02:12:24,993
MATT: Thank you for that. For elevating us.

1851
02:12:24,993 --> 02:12:37,133
BRIAN: Yeah, right. But I just want to say, as a
writer and as a friend, the foundations upon what

1852
02:12:37,133 --> 02:12:43,587
makes this show not only successful and people
watch it, but people watch it not because it's

1853
02:12:43,587 --> 02:12:53,509
entertaining only because they are a part of it in
many ways. And that creates a lot of healthy

1854
02:12:53,509 --> 02:12:59,599
things and it creates a lot of unhealthy
expectations. I just want you guys to feel like--

1855
02:12:59,599 --> 02:13:05,319
I've talked to so many Critters and so many
people. Everybody's excited to see you back, much

1856
02:13:05,319 --> 02:13:12,664
less in a new campaign and new characters and all
that stuff and a new story line. I just want to

1857
02:13:12,664 --> 02:13:18,305
set the precedent that the expectations for those
of us who really know and love the show is just

1858
02:13:18,305 --> 02:13:23,610
more nerdy ass voice actors playing D&D. Whatever
that ends up looking like. If somebody dies in

1859
02:13:23,610 --> 02:13:30,698
week two just have fun and keep doing what's made
it great.

1860
02:13:30,698 --> 02:13:35,382
MATT: Thank you, I'm hoping that. I will say these
past two and a half, three months or so where

1861
02:13:35,382 --> 02:13:42,840
we've been off the story, even with the one-shots,
it's been really hard. I've really missed getting

1862
02:13:42,840 --> 02:13:46,540
back to the table every week and playing a
consistent story with my friends. So I'm really

1863
02:13:46,540 --> 02:13:53,006
excited to get back to that. But also, for
everyone who came through the story of Vox Machina

1864
02:13:53,006 --> 02:14:00,439
with us-- That many years of character exploration
and relationship development lead to where we

1865
02:14:00,439 --> 02:14:07,516
ended that campaign. Do not expect the new
campaign to start with that level of relationship

1866
02:14:07,516 --> 02:14:12,832
development and investment! I mean anyone who's
played D&D, it's gonna be a weird ride for the

1867
02:14:12,832 --> 02:14:16,482
first beginning as everyone's figuring out their
characters, figuring out each other's characters,

1868
02:14:16,765 --> 02:14:20,092
figuring out the story and the world around them.

1869
02:14:20,092 --> 02:14:21,446
BRIAN: Accents.

1870
02:14:21,446 --> 02:14:29,130
MATT: That too, oh man. It's going to be fun. So,
all I ask is come to have fun, come to watch us have

1871
02:14:29,130 --> 02:14:32,329
fun, fumble around, and figure out where this is
going and I hope you have a good time.

1872
02:14:32,932 --> 02:14:39,991
BRIAN: Clear eyes, clear heads. What's the--
anybody watch Friday Night Lights?

1873
02:14:39,991 --> 02:14:42,327
OFF-SCREEN: Clear eyes, full hearts, can’t lose.

1874
02:14:42,327 --> 02:14:48,240
BRIAN: Thank you, Chiffre. Was that Le Chiffre?
Come over here. You guys, before we go, I have to

1875
02:14:48,240 --> 02:15:00,470
say: one year ago today Le Chiffre joined us as a
technical director, executive producer of all shows

1876
02:15:00,470 --> 02:15:06,841
on the network. He is one of the cat petting
executives. I don't know if you're gonna be able

1877
02:15:07,189 --> 02:15:14,111
to cut to a wide shot. Okay good. Come sit in
between Matt and I.

1878
02:15:14,111 --> 02:15:16,526
MATT: Come sit by my shoes, buddy.

1879
02:15:16,901 --> 02:15:23,543
BRIAN: Come curl up by the fire. Guys, this is Le
Chiffre, that's what I call him, which is his Bond

1880
02:15:23,543 --> 02:15:28,902
villain name. This is Zach, and you work really
hard, and you've been back there switching all the

1881
02:15:28,902 --> 02:15:32,704
cameras and doing all that stuff for us tonight.
How have you liked your first year at Geek &

1882
02:15:32,704 --> 02:15:36,821
Sundry? Talk into my chest because you don't have
a mic.

1883
02:15:38,306 --> 02:15:44,295
ZACH: Let me get real close here. It's been great,
this is a wonderful place to work.

1884
02:15:48,161 --> 02:15:50,099
Most of the time.

1885
02:15:50,099 --> 02:15:52,084
BRIAN: Still?

1886
02:15:52,084 --> 02:15:55,227
(laughter)

1887
02:15:55,227 --> 02:16:01,711
ZACH: This is a great place to work, this is
really a family. Everyone says that when talking

1888
02:16:01,711 --> 02:16:06,197
about working here, but it is. I couldn't be
happier working anywhere.

1889
02:16:06,197 --> 02:16:13,207
