1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:08,733
SAM: Hey, everybody! It's me, Sam Riegel! Welcome
to Not Critical Role! I will be your host for the

2
00:00:08,733 --> 00:00:14,651
evening and Dungeon Master. This is the first time
I've ever done this, so treat me nicely and

3
00:00:14,651 --> 00:00:20,741
gently. I will be guiding our players tonight
through some sort of convoluted story that I've

4
00:00:20,741 --> 00:00:28,123
come up with. My guests for this evening are
ferociously handsome and attractive people.

5
00:00:28,123 --> 00:00:37,829
Perhaps I can introduce them to you now. Over here
is cabbage-smelling Brian Foster. Next to him is

6
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:45,030
the fabulously talented and sultry Mary Elizabeth
McGlynn. Next to her is cute-as-a-button Ashly

7
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:55,781
Burch. Then my wife and yours, Liam O'Brien. Next
to him, playing his first ever game of Dungeons

8
00:00:55,781 --> 00:00:57,338
and Dragons--

9
00:00:57,338 --> 00:01:01,894
ERIC: I just got off my Uber shift, and I am
terrified right now.

10
00:01:01,894 --> 00:01:08,665
SAM: This is Eric Bauza, man of a thousand voices.
He really doesn't know how to play at all, and

11
00:01:08,665 --> 00:01:10,978
didn't really practice.

12
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:15,177
LIAM: He knows six percent less than you!

13
00:01:15,177 --> 00:01:20,613
SAM: Yeah, that's right! I will be asking for a
lot of help tonight from Liam O'Brien, as will Eric.

14
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:25,426
LIAM: And I'll turn to the right and ask Matt--
he's not here.

15
00:01:25,426 --> 00:01:32,220
SAM: Matt and Marisha and the rest of the Critical
Role gang are on the playa in Burning Man right

16
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:38,799
now, so they can't be here. Naked. Humping each
other. So they can't be here tonight, but we're

17
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:45,839
going to carry on without them and have a one-shot
deal. We have some announcements before we go,

18
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:47,037
right, Liam?

19
00:01:47,037 --> 00:01:49,026
LIAM: Yeah, I got some, you got some.

20
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:56,828
SAM: I'll start. First, new merch, guys! New merch
available in the store right now. This awesome

21
00:01:56,828 --> 00:02:06,557
shirt that says Dalen's Closet in Shamal Bay. It's
a little throwback to that little fun beach

22
00:02:06,557 --> 00:02:10,229
adventure we had with pranks and stuff. Ooh, it's
so soft.

23
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:14,442
LIAM: If you think that sleeves are bullshit, we
have this one, as well.

24
00:02:14,442 --> 00:02:16,915
SAM: Wow, that's such a beachy shirt!

25
00:02:16,915 --> 00:02:21,542
ERIC: You get a great tan with that shirt.

26
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:27,944
SAM: Wow, I love it! And it's available in the
store already? Now? Go purchase it! Go purchase

27
00:02:27,944 --> 00:02:29,429
the shirts.

28
00:02:29,429 --> 00:02:32,637
BRIAN: I want to see Travis wear that when he
works out.

29
00:02:32,637 --> 00:02:37,734
LIAM: There's more stuff, though. Well, the Dagger
Dagger Dagger shirt is back. I know that's not

30
00:02:37,734 --> 00:02:43,188
brand new, but it's new-ish. The Scanlan shirt is
even less new-ish, but it's an amazing shirt, and

31
00:02:43,188 --> 00:02:46,669
it's still there. We have the aprons still, we
have pencils, we have Tarot cards. I feel like

32
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:54,180
going: ooh. She's in the desert; she can't touch
me right now. That's it.

33
00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:01,869
SAM: So that's our merch update. Liam and I will
be tomorrow morning flying to Sacramento to do

34
00:03:01,869 --> 00:03:03,503
SacAnime. Are you doing it, Mary?

35
00:03:03,503 --> 00:03:09,560
MARY: No, I have to do a red-eye on Friday night
to Dragon Con. Yes, very exciting, to meet Mr.

36
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,771
Steve Blum there. I haven't met, I'm looking
forward to it.

37
00:03:13,771 --> 00:03:23,818
SAM: So we'll be in Sacramento for the weekend, me
and Liam, doing stuff. Come see us. Come say hi if

38
00:03:23,818 --> 00:03:32,671
you're in the northern central California
vicinity. Sure. Any other announcements, Liam?

39
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:37,682
LIAM: Yeah, we've got that art book coming out. If
you want to get updates you can go over to

40
00:03:37,682 --> 00:03:43,105
geekandsundry.com/artbook and sign up for updates,
and you'll get the latest. And then also,

41
00:03:43,105 --> 00:03:48,172
Taliesin's not here; he's also naked in the
desert, but on Wednesday he'll be back for

42
00:03:48,172 --> 00:03:53,525
Wednesday Club. In addition to everything they're
going to be talking about, there will be a little

43
00:03:53,525 --> 00:04:00,098
scuttlebutt about the Critical Role comic book. We
might show you the cover of the damn thing. Other

44
00:04:00,098 --> 00:04:02,778
things to announce about it, so tune in if you're
curious.

45
00:04:02,778 --> 00:04:06,392
BRIAN: There's Talks Machina Tuesday night.

46
00:04:06,392 --> 00:04:08,489
SAM: Oh Jesus, Brian, come on.

47
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:15,549
BRIAN: It's shameless self promotion at this
point. But no, it's great, actually, to be a part

48
00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:21,772
of the show that I have been riding the coattails
of this past year. It's great to finally be a part

49
00:04:21,772 --> 00:04:27,662
of the actual show. Tuesday nights, Talks Machina.
I'll talk to you guys afterward about who's going

50
00:04:27,662 --> 00:04:32,772
to be on, and then we'll announce. So that's it,
7:00 on these very channels.

51
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,002
SAM: Eric, anything to plug?

52
00:04:35,002 --> 00:04:41,400
ERIC: DuckTales. That's how we do our thing. We're
on DuckTales together.

53
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,156
LIAM: Yeah, he plays many characters.

54
00:04:43,156 --> 00:04:49,070
ERIC: Yes, actually, I think the 23rd may be the
introduction of the many characters.

55
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:57,485
SAM: Oh is that true? September 23rd, tune in to
DuckTales. He played 30 characters in one episode?

56
00:04:57,485 --> 00:04:59,257
Something like that. It's a lot.

57
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:05,766
ERIC: I had to sing Happy Birthday 47 times. 47
different accents.

58
00:05:05,766 --> 00:05:07,803
SAM: Ash-boo, anything?

59
00:05:07,803 --> 00:05:13,333
ASHLY: I think you're great and you're going to do
a great job. Oh, OK K.O.!, which Mary's also on,

60
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:17,337
is out now on Cartoon Network. Are you on it,
Bauza?

61
00:05:17,337 --> 00:05:18,485
ERIC: No.

62
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:23,438
(laughter)

63
00:05:23,438 --> 00:05:30,838
ERIC: I'm just trying to learn how to play
tonight. This is my guy. It's almost like it's the

64
00:05:30,838 --> 00:05:33,247
same person.

65
00:05:33,247 --> 00:05:40,839
SAM: All right, so with all that out of the way,
let's dive into another episode of Critical Role!

66
00:05:40,839 --> 00:07:10,407
[dramatic music]

67
00:07:10,468 --> 00:07:13,172
SAM: Hi guys! Welcome back!

68
00:07:13,172 --> 00:07:15,881
BRIAN: He got in just under the wire.

69
00:07:15,881 --> 00:07:18,611
LIAM: Safe. Totally safe.

70
00:07:18,611 --> 00:07:20,517
ERIC: How many drinks do you have going there?

71
00:07:20,517 --> 00:07:23,137
SAM: I have two drinks, one alcoholic--

72
00:07:23,137 --> 00:07:24,907
BRIAN: And one if that one breaks down.

73
00:07:24,907 --> 00:07:31,780
SAM: Okay. So needless to say, I'm super nervous
because I've never done this before, but it's

74
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:37,971
going to be fun, and if it sucks then who cares,
right? So let's just dive in, right? I'm going to

75
00:07:37,971 --> 00:07:40,065
play music from my iPad.

76
00:07:40,065 --> 00:07:42,924
BRIAN: Thank you for telling us everything you're
doing as you do it.

77
00:07:42,924 --> 00:07:49,569
SAM: I'm now turning to my notes. All right. I'm
about to begin the show.

78
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:53,483
BRIAN: This is great.

79
00:07:53,483 --> 00:08:02,522
SAM: Here we go. Black and white, as far as the
eye can see. The black of a cold night sky, the

80
00:08:02,522 --> 00:08:08,822
white of ice capping every tree and dusting the
roads below. It is a frigid, monochromatic night

81
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:15,630
in Jorenn Village, at the foot of the Umber
Hills-- until! A flash of yellow hair, hoofbeats,

82
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:22,708
a fast-moving horse, a young human woman riding at
top speed through the windy night. She barrels

83
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:27,762
down the street, muttering to herself, "Shit,
shit, shit, I'm late again!"

84
00:08:27,762 --> 00:08:37,002
Then suddenly, a thunk. The horse whinnies. Did
she just hit something or someone? Oh no. The

85
00:08:37,002 --> 00:08:42,729
young woman stops, dismounts, walks back, and sees
an awful sight. An old woman in a simple grey

86
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:52,632
robe, cane in a mangled hand, face bloody, arm
broken. She's motionless, ashen. "Oh fuck," says

87
00:08:52,632 --> 00:09:03,292
the girl. "Oh my fuck. I think I-- is that a-- I
just killed someone. Oh gods, what am I going to

88
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:09,175
"do? I am so dead." The young woman looks around.
No one to call for a doctor. No fire-lit homes to

89
00:09:09,175 --> 00:09:11,157
knock on for help.

90
00:09:11,157 --> 00:09:20,539
Wait. No lights. No prying eyes. No <i>witnesses</i>.
The rider takes a breath, kicks a little snow over

91
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:26,263
the body of the old woman, checks the streets one
more time, and then mounts the horse and gets the

92
00:09:26,263 --> 00:09:33,588
hell out of there, no one the wiser. She rides on,
feeling guilty, but also relieved. No one saw,

93
00:09:33,588 --> 00:09:35,247
right? Right?

94
00:09:35,247 --> 00:09:40,361
In a few minutes she arrives at her destination,
shivering with cold. She ties her horse to the

95
00:09:40,361 --> 00:09:47,557
lion statue across the street, just in time for
her shift at the second crappiest tavern in town:

96
00:09:47,557 --> 00:09:56,900
The Ass Sailor. The sign above the door once said
"The Crass Sailor," but months ago, vandals pried

97
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:08,027
off the shitty letters C-R, so now it just reads,
"The Ass Sailor." The name seems to have resonated

98
00:10:08,027 --> 00:10:11,200
with its low-life patrons and they seem to prefer
it.

99
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,852
The poorly built tavern sits on the foundation of
an old chapel, and some time in the last hundred

100
00:10:15,852 --> 00:10:22,394
years was expanded to two stories: a pub on the
bottom and rooms above. Despite its thin walls, it

101
00:10:22,394 --> 00:10:27,475
has one feature that regulars love on nights like
this: it is notoriously warm.

102
00:10:27,475 --> 00:10:34,135
The woman pushes open the door, jogs past the Ass
Sailor's source of heat: a large hearth, blurred

103
00:10:34,135 --> 00:10:39,994
with red coals. It's a small fireplace, but no
matter where you sit in The Ass Sailor, you always

104
00:10:39,994 --> 00:10:45,810
stay weirdly warm. So toasty, in fact, that
there's a massive pile of jackets and scarves and

105
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:51,981
weapons to the left of the door. Everyone inside
has stripped down to the bare minimum of dress.

106
00:10:51,981 --> 00:10:58,952
With the lack of clothing comes an oversupply of
skin, skin of all shades and body parts. The ruddy

107
00:10:58,952 --> 00:11:04,964
belly of a human salesman stuffing himself on
rotten mutton. The dark blue-tinted shoulder of a

108
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:11,596
tiefling whore, enticing a gray, bearded, older
man upstairs. The gray forearm of a half-orc

109
00:11:11,596 --> 00:11:19,562
merchant, drawing a mug of Greep from the keg on
the bar. Greep, by the way, is a homemade house

110
00:11:19,562 --> 00:11:26,814
liqueur. It's so potent, its nickname is "kindling"
because it is also extremely flammable. Hint,

111
00:11:26,814 --> 00:11:31,461
hint, hint!

112
00:11:31,461 --> 00:11:34,206
LIAM: Red barrels, everywhere!

113
00:11:34,206 --> 00:11:40,430
SAM: "You're late!" calls the bar manager, Xavier,
wiping his hands on his grubby chef's apron.

114
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:47,814
"I hit some unexpected traffic on the road!"
replies your late-shift bartender, Valerie, as she

115
00:11:47,814 --> 00:11:53,583
puts on her apron and ducks behind the bar. There
are a dozen tables, most populated with drunken

116
00:11:53,583 --> 00:12:00,088
assholes, half-witted con artists, and infectious
laughter. Val gets right to work on a night that

117
00:12:00,088 --> 00:12:03,322
will prove to be unlike any other.

118
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:11,111
At the bar, a noble half-elf woman with fiery
eyes, dark skin, and spectacular blonde hair

119
00:12:11,111 --> 00:12:17,673
nervously fidgets with her necklace. She glances
about, looking for someone. In an elegant blue

120
00:12:17,673 --> 00:12:23,846
and white gown and golden jewelry, she is
definitely out of place among the riffraff. This,

121
00:12:23,903 --> 00:12:26,229
we will learn, is Gryffin.

122
00:12:26,229 --> 00:12:34,203
Val, the bartender, approaches. "Hi. So what can I
get you?"

123
00:12:34,203 --> 00:12:36,864
MARY: What is your name?

124
00:12:36,864 --> 00:12:38,283
SAM: "Valerie, hi."

125
00:12:38,283 --> 00:12:42,019
MARy: Hello. Do you have any scotch?

126
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:45,743
SAM: "Well, no." I have a menu.

127
00:12:45,743 --> 00:12:46,896
MARY: You do?

128
00:12:46,896 --> 00:12:55,460
SAM: I'm over-prepared. Oh god, I've lost the
menu. Oh god, everything's gone wrong one minute

129
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:59,048
into the show. Oh god. "We have ale."

130
00:12:59,048 --> 00:13:02,476
MARY: Any Fireball?

131
00:13:02,476 --> 00:13:10,125
SAM: "We have Greep, which is the house liqueur. We
have some whiskey, and we have some wine. The wine

132
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,535
"is not very good."

133
00:13:11,535 --> 00:13:15,745
MARY: I'll have the whiskey. Actually, you know
what? Can I have whiskey with a Greep chaser, please?

134
00:13:15,745 --> 00:13:18,335
SAM: "Oh, sure. That'll be seven copper."

135
00:13:18,335 --> 00:13:19,560
MARY: All right, here.

136
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,583
SAM: "There you go. What brings you around here?
Haven't seen you before."

137
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:31,430
MARY: Oh, well, mostly to get out of the cold.
Actually, maybe you can help me. I'm so sorry.

138
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:39,360
I've been looking for a girl, and there was a man
who told me of this place.

139
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,837
SAM: "Well, we have two ladies of the night over
there. One is named Zarvah; she's the tiefling,

140
00:13:44,837 --> 00:13:51,040
"and she's a crowd pleaser. Yes. The other is Kay,
and she's over there as well."

141
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:57,121
MARY: Thank you, thank you. Actually, I was
looking for someone a bit younger than both of

142
00:13:57,121 --> 00:14:01,751
them. She has red hair. I'm wondering if you've
seen anyone quite like that?

143
00:14:01,751 --> 00:14:08,614
SAM: "I'm no one to judge but whatever sort of
thing floats your boat. I don't know any young

144
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:10,562
"whores, if that's what you're asking for."

145
00:14:10,562 --> 00:14:15,659
MARY: No, just a young girl. All right. Frankfurt,
have you heard of a man named Frankfurt?

146
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:23,527
SAM: "Sure, yes. Frankfurt. He's a dwarven man. He
comes in here from time to time. I think he's on a

147
00:14:23,527 --> 00:14:25,199
"run. I haven't seen him tonight."

148
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:30,086
MARY: All right. Well, he told me to come here, so
I did. So I'll just have a drink for now, if

149
00:14:30,086 --> 00:14:31,140
that's all right.

150
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,421
SAM: "All right, I'll let you know if he
arrives."

151
00:14:33,421 --> 00:14:35,279
MARY: Thank you so much, I do appreciate that,
Val.

152
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:43,033
SAM: Just then, a tall female humanoid with
rippling biceps and long whiskers takes the next

153
00:14:43,033 --> 00:14:55,414
stool over. She's covered with tan and orange fur,
which is unsurprising because she is tabaxi, a

154
00:14:55,414 --> 00:15:02,436
cat-woman. Her feline face is bandaged from recent
battles, and she snarls with an imposing posture

155
00:15:02,436 --> 00:15:11,573
that says, "Don't fuck with me." This is
Clothesline. Val approaches. "Oh, hey,

156
00:15:11,573 --> 00:15:14,221
"Clothesline. The usual, I assume?"

157
00:15:14,221 --> 00:15:16,943
ASHLY: Do you have the milk that I ordered?

158
00:15:16,943 --> 00:15:23,601
SAM: "Yes." Val takes out a saucer of warm milk
and puts it on the bar. "Oh, and here's some

159
00:15:23,601 --> 00:15:29,451
"spice, too." She places a box of crimson powder on
the bar. It is catnip.

160
00:15:29,451 --> 00:15:31,457
ASHLY: Thanks, Val.

161
00:15:31,457 --> 00:15:34,619
SAM: "What happened to your face?"

162
00:15:34,619 --> 00:15:40,154
ASHLY: Oh, you know. It's a funny story. I
clotheslined some people.

163
00:15:40,154 --> 00:15:41,551
SAM: "Oh, that's--"

164
00:15:41,551 --> 00:15:48,307
ASHLY: Yeah. And their nails were not cut.
Generally when you clothesline someone you (clicks

165
00:15:48,307 --> 00:15:53,739
tongue) go, but they caught on for a little bit,
went for a little bit of a ride, and then I killed

166
00:15:53,739 --> 00:15:57,440
them. So that's that.

167
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:04,447
SAM: "Wow. That sounds like a lovely evening?"

168
00:16:04,447 --> 00:16:08,740
AHSLY: Oh yeah, it was great! I could've done
without all the cleanup after. There was a lot of

169
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,573
blood. It's hard to get out of the old fur.

170
00:16:11,573 --> 00:16:17,935
SAM: "Sure. Clothesline, this is-- What was your
name again?"

171
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,958
MARY: Gryffin. Gryffin Erendel.

172
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:21,223
ASHLY: Hi.

173
00:16:21,223 --> 00:16:22,952
MARY: Hello, how are you?

174
00:16:22,952 --> 00:16:25,098
ASHLY: You got weird eyes. What's the deal with
her eyes?

175
00:16:25,098 --> 00:16:28,061
MARY: They're gold. There's nothing wrong with
them.

176
00:16:28,061 --> 00:16:30,586
ASHLY: They're gold, like currency gold?

177
00:16:30,586 --> 00:16:38,768
MARY: No, they're not karated gold, they're just
gold. I'm a sunny Eladrin half-elf, all right?

178
00:16:38,768 --> 00:16:41,731
ASHLY: What does that mean?

179
00:16:41,731 --> 00:16:43,692
SAM: "I don't know. I don't really know."

180
00:16:43,692 --> 00:16:46,794
MARY: It doesn't matter. Why do you have fur? Why
does anybody have anything? It's just who I am.

181
00:16:46,794 --> 00:16:51,345
It's who you are. So cheers to us.

182
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:53,653
ASHLY: I don't cheers ladies with weird eyes.

183
00:16:53,653 --> 00:17:00,994
MARY: All right. You've got a little blood on you
there, dear.

184
00:17:00,994 --> 00:17:09,021
SAM: As they speak, over at a small table, a young
human girl sits alone, peering out of her hooded

185
00:17:09,021 --> 00:17:17,303
cloak. She has almost translucent skin, and snowy
wisps of white hair fall over her face. Her cool

186
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:22,275
blue eyes reveal a quiet confidence, but she seems
guarded and keeping her back to the wall, not

187
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:29,638
touching her glass of water. This is Jayne.
Strolling over to the table, with a wobbly gait,

188
00:17:29,638 --> 00:17:37,922
is a short elven man with gray skin, gray hair,
and a black leather choker. He wears a sour

189
00:17:37,922 --> 00:17:44,337
expression and projects abject apathy. He reeks of
booze and appears to be wearing dark red eye

190
00:17:44,337 --> 00:17:50,372
makeup. This is Kingston, and it looks like
Kingston is approaching Jayne.

191
00:17:50,372 --> 00:17:58,574
BRIAN: Evening.

192
00:17:58,574 --> 00:18:00,349
LIAM: Oh, hello.

193
00:18:00,349 --> 00:18:04,566
BRIAN: Do you come here a lot?

194
00:18:04,566 --> 00:18:08,676
LIAM: No. I am traveling, actually.

195
00:18:08,676 --> 00:18:10,778
BRIAN: Alone?

196
00:18:10,778 --> 00:18:13,074
LIAM: Yes.

197
00:18:13,074 --> 00:18:19,096
BRIAN: By what mode of transportation are you
traveling?

198
00:18:19,096 --> 00:18:25,447
LIAM: Well, have a seat, I'll tell you everything.
Let's start with my childhood.

199
00:18:25,447 --> 00:18:30,246
BRIAN: Great! Do you want a drink?

200
00:18:30,246 --> 00:18:39,022
LIAM: No, and that was irony. I could have
something to eat. Do you want to get us something

201
00:18:39,022 --> 00:18:41,486
to eat?

202
00:18:41,486 --> 00:18:50,532
BRIAN: Yeah. Any dietary restrictions? I don't
want to walk over and then have to come back.

203
00:18:50,532 --> 00:18:52,583
LIAM: Just a little something.

204
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:58,663
BRIAN: Okay. I'll walk over to Val. Unless there's
table service?

205
00:18:58,663 --> 00:19:05,238
SAM: Hell no. "Hi, Kingston. What can I get for
you?"

206
00:19:05,238 --> 00:19:09,581
BRIAN: Me and the child over there need food.

207
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:11,938
SAM: "The child?"

208
00:19:11,938 --> 00:19:16,512
BRIAN: She's a bit young for me. I like them old.

209
00:19:16,512 --> 00:19:19,612
SAM: "You're going to buy this person food?"

210
00:19:19,612 --> 00:19:21,242
BRIAN: Yes.

211
00:19:21,242 --> 00:19:23,483
SAM: "With what money?"

212
00:19:23,483 --> 00:19:29,308
BRIAN: You can put it on my fucking tab, for
starters. She looks famished. She's traveled by

213
00:19:29,308 --> 00:19:34,343
some unknown mode of transportation. She looks
famished. She doesn't want a drink. She wants to

214
00:19:34,343 --> 00:19:37,303
eat. Put it on my tab. Consider it a humanitarian
gift.

215
00:19:37,303 --> 00:19:40,818
SAM: "All right, I'll give you some bread. All
right?"

216
00:19:40,818 --> 00:19:45,178
BRIAN: And also some Greep for me.

217
00:19:45,178 --> 00:19:55,439
SAM: "Fine." Takes a glass of Greep for you. "And
here's two loaves of bread. On your tab. Again."

218
00:19:55,439 --> 00:20:04,615
BRIAN: Thank you. I walk over and hand her the
loaves. Here you go.

219
00:20:04,615 --> 00:20:06,092
LIAM: That's nice.

220
00:20:06,092 --> 00:20:09,339
BRIAN: I get stuff free around here.

221
00:20:09,339 --> 00:20:10,984
LIAM: You're from here?

222
00:20:10,984 --> 00:20:12,700
BRIAN: Yeah. Nearby.

223
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,584
LIAM: Is it always this cold?

224
00:20:15,584 --> 00:20:21,580
BRIAN: Well, not in here. But outside? Yeah, it's
pretty cold.

225
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:24,176
LIAM: I'm sorry, what was your name?

226
00:20:24,176 --> 00:20:26,211
BRIAN: Kingston LaForge.

227
00:20:26,211 --> 00:20:27,543
LIAM: Strong name.

228
00:20:27,543 --> 00:20:30,463
BRIAN: Thank you. I come from a long line of
LaForges.

229
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:37,408
LIAM: Tell me about yourself. And as he goes, she
starts inspecting the room, kind of listening.

230
00:20:37,408 --> 00:20:44,410
SAM: All right, you see a bunch of rowdy people
all about you. No one out of the ordinary that you

231
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:51,861
can see so far. Let's see here, what interesting
things? You know what? Make a perception check.

232
00:20:51,861 --> 00:21:01,163
LIAM: It was almost good. Ten.

233
00:21:01,163 --> 00:21:10,600
SAM: You see lots of festive people eating lots of
food and drinking lots of wine. That's about it.

234
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,612
LIAM: Does anybody look dangerous?

235
00:21:13,612 --> 00:21:23,369
SAM: Dangerous? Well, most of the people in here
are weaponless. Some do have weapons. The tabaxi

236
00:21:23,369 --> 00:21:34,857
over there is packing some biceps and some sharp
claws. There's a couple of guards. There's one

237
00:21:34,857 --> 00:21:40,657
guard over near the door who's watching people's
cloaks and whatever weapons have been checked.

238
00:21:40,657 --> 00:21:47,931
There's another city guard who's drinking, but
he's got his sword. He's near the wall over there.

239
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:54,911
He's got his sword sheathed, and he looks like he
could do some damage, maybe. That's about it. The

240
00:21:54,911 --> 00:22:00,087
prostitutes look really feisty, and one of them is
having an argument, still,

241
00:22:00,087 --> 00:22:02,340
with this man, about payment.

242
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,777
LIAM: So you were going to tell me your story?

243
00:22:04,777 --> 00:22:08,554
BRIAN: Did you see that cat lady over there?

244
00:22:08,554 --> 00:22:10,855
LIAM: Yes, I did.

245
00:22:10,855 --> 00:22:22,765
BRIAN: She is something else. I'm not saying I
have a type, but my preferred terrain is a litter box.

246
00:22:22,765 --> 00:22:30,776
LIAM: You know, I'm happy to share the loaves of
bread with you, but my feelings won't be hurt if

247
00:22:30,776 --> 00:22:33,135
you want to change over.

248
00:22:33,135 --> 00:22:42,686
BRIAN: Thank you, but I'll tell you a little bit
about myself first. What would you like to know?

249
00:22:42,686 --> 00:22:46,015
LIAM: Oh, start from the beginning. You grew up
here? Tell me all about it.

250
00:22:46,015 --> 00:22:51,819
BRIAN: I was born Kingston LaForge. Still am. To a
long line of LaForges.

251
00:22:51,819 --> 00:22:54,489
MARY: Did you hear him say Kingston LaForge?

252
00:22:54,489 --> 00:22:56,329
BRIAN: My family was acrobats.

253
00:22:56,329 --> 00:22:58,592
ASHLY: Why is she talking to me, Val?

254
00:22:58,592 --> 00:23:10,818
BRIAN: Carnies. 24/7 locksmiths. I, however, was
afraid of heights, so I had to learn how to sing

255
00:23:10,818 --> 00:23:23,560
for my supper. However, nature took over around
the age of teen. I lost my beautiful singing

256
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:27,040
voice. It was a falsetto, a very lovely falsetto.

257
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,526
LIAM: When you were young, you lost it? That must
have been a long time ago.

258
00:23:30,526 --> 00:23:46,122
BRIAN: Oh yes, over 100 years. So I left my family
and the traveling circus, and I found myself a

259
00:23:46,122 --> 00:23:53,830
wife, Cloris. We wed, and together, I wrote some
of the best books the land has ever seen.

260
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:58,546
LIAM: Jayne is quietly digging her fingernails
into her leg to stop from screaming.

261
00:23:58,546 --> 00:24:02,211
MARY: I quietly start pounding on the bar.

262
00:24:02,211 --> 00:24:08,027
BRIAN: Together, we bore a child, and it was one
of the most incredible things that ever happened

263
00:24:08,027 --> 00:24:10,228
to me. The child was precious.

264
00:24:10,228 --> 00:24:13,006
ASHLY: Oh my god, Kingston, give it a rest!

265
00:24:13,006 --> 00:24:15,169
BRIAN: Hi!

266
00:24:15,169 --> 00:24:16,403
ASHLY: Hi.

267
00:24:16,403 --> 00:24:18,530
BRIAN: I was just talking to this child--

268
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:23,307
ASHLY: Yeah, I get it. It's creepy. Could you stop
creeping us all out? You re-hash your goddamn life

269
00:24:23,307 --> 00:24:25,353
story every time you come in here.

270
00:24:25,353 --> 00:24:35,354
BRIAN: She asked! I simply brought her free food.
She asked me a question. I have an interesting story.

271
00:24:35,354 --> 00:24:41,269
ASHLY: You don't have an interesting-- No! Your
beautiful falsetto? No! No one cares!

272
00:24:41,269 --> 00:24:43,200
BRIAN: You say that because you never got to hear
it.

273
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,963
MARY: Hello, I'm sorry, my name is Gryffin Erendel
and I'm the biggest fan. I can't begin to tell you

274
00:24:47,963 --> 00:24:52,294
how much I love your work. Your book of poetry,
Black and White, was one of the most amazing

275
00:24:52,294 --> 00:24:56,262
things I've ever read in my entire life and I
happen to have a copy with me. Would you please

276
00:24:56,262 --> 00:24:59,012
sign it? Do you mind? I don't want to intrude. I
would pay for it.

277
00:24:59,012 --> 00:25:01,615
BRIAN: Have you read some of my other books?

278
00:25:01,615 --> 00:25:03,448
MARY: Yes, I have!

279
00:25:03,448 --> 00:25:05,390
BRIAN: Two Witches, One Broom?

280
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:07,518
MARY: Yes, yes! The Wicked Grouse?

281
00:25:07,518 --> 00:25:11,944
BRIAN: Yes, Doors: The Idiot's Enemy?

282
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:13,826
ASHLY: Val, another milk, please!

283
00:25:13,826 --> 00:25:16,708
BRIAN: Here you go. Here's your book.

284
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:18,465
SAM: "I made it a double."

285
00:25:18,465 --> 00:25:19,759
ASHLY: Thank you.

286
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:22,942
MARY: You have no idea. Would you read from it?

287
00:25:22,942 --> 00:25:32,764
BRIAN: I will, after. May I talk to you for a
minute? I know, may I just-- (sighs) I know we

288
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:39,360
don't get along very often. However, I find you to
be very attractive.

289
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,769
ASHLY: Oh, what the hell, Kingston!

290
00:25:41,769 --> 00:25:49,030
BRIAN: I've struggled on how to say this to you,
but--

291
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:54,454
ASHLY: You are this close from a claw in your
goddamn eye, Kingston. So choose the next few

292
00:25:54,454 --> 00:25:57,470
words carefully.

293
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:59,518
BRIAN: Catnip and chill?

294
00:25:59,518 --> 00:26:01,610
ASHLY: Can I attack Kingston?

295
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:05,329
SAM: Sure! Whatever you want to do.

296
00:26:05,329 --> 00:26:08,149
MARY: I step back.

297
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:10,422
ASHLY: I try to punch Kingston in the mouth.

298
00:26:10,422 --> 00:26:12,368
SAM: All right, roll for an attack.

299
00:26:12,368 --> 00:26:18,975
ASHLY: Okay, let's see. I don't want to use my
claws. I guess I'm going to clothesline him.

300
00:26:18,975 --> 00:26:21,716
SAM: Great. Clothesline attack.

301
00:26:21,716 --> 00:26:23,017
ASHLY: 1d4.

302
00:26:23,017 --> 00:26:26,439
SAM: Roll a d20, add, what is it, five?

303
00:26:26,439 --> 00:26:27,960
ASHLY: 13.

304
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,816
SAM: Okay, what's your armor class there,
Kingston?

305
00:26:30,816 --> 00:26:36,462
BRIAN: My armor? 13.

306
00:26:36,462 --> 00:26:45,817
SAM: That's a hit, right, Liam? 13 and 13, that's
a hit? All right, roll for damage. 1d4 plus something.

307
00:26:45,817 --> 00:26:47,650
ASHLY: Eight!

308
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:53,454
SAM: Wow! Did you roll a four? Okay, so you don't
have to roll for anything.

309
00:26:53,454 --> 00:26:56,695
BRIAN: Hold on, I'm buried in my notes.

310
00:26:56,695 --> 00:27:01,557
SAM: So Clothesline has a special clothesline
attack. If she rolls a four, it's eight points of

311
00:27:01,557 --> 00:27:04,505
damage to you, sir, and you are knocked prone.

312
00:27:04,505 --> 00:27:07,030
BRIAN: Shit, that's amazing!

313
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:09,700
SAM: That's a big fucking hit.

314
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:15,899
ASHLY: It is! I deliberately didn't use my claws
because I didn't want to hurt you too much!

315
00:27:15,899 --> 00:27:23,175
SAM: So Kingston slams down onto the floor, taking
a couple of drinks with him. He's dazed. He's

316
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:25,932
woozy. He looks around. He didn't even see it
coming.

317
00:27:25,932 --> 00:27:27,438
BRIAN: Did my drink go with me?

318
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:32,297
SAM: Sure, yeah. Greep all over the floor. All
over you. You now have a flammable alcohol all

319
00:27:32,297 --> 00:27:38,086
over you. It's probably stinging your eyes. You
hardly know who hit you or why.

320
00:27:38,086 --> 00:27:40,945
BRIAN: I'm blinded!

321
00:27:40,945 --> 00:27:44,975
MARY: He will write of this day, and I will know
that I was here!

322
00:27:44,975 --> 00:27:48,296
BRIAN: You're going to have to write this down. I
can't see!

323
00:27:48,296 --> 00:27:50,133
MARY: It's all in my mind!

324
00:27:50,133 --> 00:27:56,030
SAM: Xavier, the manager, comes over. "All right,
enough of that! No fights tonight, all right?"

325
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,297
ASHLY: Sorry, Xave, sorry.

326
00:27:57,297 --> 00:28:02,186
BRIAN: It was just foreplay. We have a big night
planned, and I'm sorry we started it in your

327
00:28:02,186 --> 00:28:03,222
establishment.

328
00:28:03,222 --> 00:28:05,261
ASHLY: No fights? What about a murder? One
murder?

329
00:28:05,261 --> 00:28:07,772
SAM: "Nothing like that tonight, please."

330
00:28:07,772 --> 00:28:09,819
MARY: I use Prestidigitation to cleanse him off.

331
00:28:09,819 --> 00:28:13,446
ASHLY: What did you just do?

332
00:28:13,446 --> 00:28:21,310
SAM: Some magical energy comes out of her and
magically cleans up the stains off of his shirt.

333
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:28,429
Everyone in the bar turns to see and goes like
this to you when you do it. You are no longer

334
00:28:28,429 --> 00:28:29,397
flammable.

335
00:28:29,397 --> 00:28:38,522
ASHLY: What the hell was that? What you just did?
Creepy guy? He's no longer whatever?

336
00:28:38,522 --> 00:28:40,174
MARY: What, you've never heard of magic?

337
00:28:40,174 --> 00:28:43,104
ASHLY: I know about magic.

338
00:28:43,104 --> 00:28:46,271
MARY: Oh, you do? Well then, why are you asking me
such a silly question?

339
00:28:46,271 --> 00:28:50,366
ASHLY: Val, I'm going to move to a table.

340
00:28:50,366 --> 00:28:51,436
SAM: "Sure."

341
00:28:51,436 --> 00:28:53,196
MARY: I meant no offense.

342
00:28:53,196 --> 00:29:01,258
SAM: As the tabaxi glides across the room, finding
another table, let's move you over here. I just

343
00:29:01,258 --> 00:29:02,741
knocked over a stool.

344
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:08,628
BRIAN: I'm going to walk back over to Jayne. Yeah,
because things didn't go as well as I was hoping.

345
00:29:08,628 --> 00:29:16,949
SAM: So you're alone by the bar now? Yes. And just
then, the wind whips into the bar again as the

346
00:29:16,949 --> 00:29:26,508
door opens. Valerie, the bartender, gasps, scared
it might be the dead old lady. But instead, it is

347
00:29:26,508 --> 00:29:34,606
not. Two stout male dwarves walk in. Behind them,
a young girl with fire-red hair and elven ears.

348
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:48,535
They walk in, and let's put them here for now. One dwarf
is sullen, with thick muttonchops and a stumpy

349
00:29:48,535 --> 00:30:00,152
axe. He says, "I tire of the road. We eat here and
rest. Frankfurt, this is your job. You pay. Obby

350
00:30:00,152 --> 00:30:02,010
"the Rat is done for the day."

351
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:06,011
ASHLY and LIAM: Yes!

352
00:30:06,011 --> 00:30:10,957
SAM: The other dwarf is a younger, stronger man
with a braided beard, piercing eyes, and a heavy

353
00:30:10,957 --> 00:30:16,546
maul in his hand. He scans the room and picks a
table. Unlike some of the patrons, these two do

354
00:30:16,546 --> 00:30:21,851
not check their weapons. Instead, they park them
under the table. This is Frankfurt and his friend,

355
00:30:21,851 --> 00:30:28,899
Obby the Rat. They pull up a chair for the young,
fair-skinned ginger girl, who joins them. Her eyes

356
00:30:28,899 --> 00:30:36,406
sparkle with innocence and a touch of fear. Her
name, we will learn, is Holly. "You have been to

357
00:30:36,406 --> 00:30:37,883
"this place before?"

358
00:30:37,883 --> 00:30:41,242
ERIC: Yep, many times. Known for their Greep.

359
00:30:41,242 --> 00:30:42,839
SAM: "What is that?"

360
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:46,315
ERIC: Delicious, is what it is. You should try
some.

361
00:30:46,315 --> 00:30:48,728
SAM: "Obby the Rat drinks ale."

362
00:30:48,728 --> 00:30:56,023
ERIC: Careful, there's a cat-woman in here. You
might want to be careful of that. Val!

363
00:30:56,023 --> 00:30:57,660
Two Greeps, please!

364
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:03,133
SAM: "Yes, right away, Frankfurt! That's him."

365
00:31:03,133 --> 00:31:04,775
MARY: Thank you so much.

366
00:31:04,775 --> 00:31:06,356
SAM: "Certainly. Tips would be appreciated."

367
00:31:06,356 --> 00:31:10,054
MARY: Oh, of course! What was I thinking? Here. I
give her a piece of gold.

368
00:31:10,054 --> 00:31:12,405
SAM: "Oh, wow. Thank you very much."

369
00:31:12,405 --> 00:31:13,560
MARY: You're welcome.

370
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,906
ERIC: I start taking off my clothes.

371
00:31:15,906 --> 00:31:17,192
SAM: "All of your clothes?"

372
00:31:17,192 --> 00:31:20,070
ERIC: Almost all. It's hot. It's boiling in here.

373
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:28,176
SAM: "It is very hot. Are you sure you want to
strip down? There are unsavory types in here."

374
00:31:28,176 --> 00:31:33,345
ERIC: I'm a regular. They've seen the merchandise
before.

375
00:31:33,345 --> 00:31:34,911
SAM: "Yes."

376
00:31:34,911 --> 00:31:39,795
ERIC: But don't attract too much attention to us.
We've got some cargo here that people might be

377
00:31:39,795 --> 00:31:41,123
interested in.

378
00:31:41,123 --> 00:31:45,964
SAM: "What cargo? We are not transporting any
cargo tonight."

379
00:31:45,964 --> 00:31:50,940
ERIC: Well, not anything in particular that anyone
would be looking for, but have

380
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:54,358
you seen Garello around?

381
00:31:54,358 --> 00:32:03,968
SAM: "I do not know this Garello. You have spoken
of him, but I don't know that I would recognize him."

382
00:32:03,968 --> 00:32:06,984
ERIC: Well, keep your eyes peeled.

383
00:32:06,984 --> 00:32:09,565
SAM: "Perhaps ask someone else."

384
00:32:09,565 --> 00:32:16,726
ERIC: Hey, Cat-Woman?

385
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:18,934
ASHLY: Oh, for fuck's sake, what?

386
00:32:18,934 --> 00:32:21,910
ERIC: How are you?

387
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:23,815
ASHLY: How do I look?

388
00:32:23,815 --> 00:32:31,196
ERIC: Bloody! And your glass is half empty. Val!
More milk, please!

389
00:32:31,196 --> 00:32:35,898
SAM: "Right away. Whole or skim this time?"

390
00:32:35,898 --> 00:32:37,795
ASHLY: Give me the raw shit.

391
00:32:37,795 --> 00:32:39,100
SAM: "Okay."

392
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:43,313
ERIC: So! How's your night been?

393
00:32:43,313 --> 00:32:45,393
ASHLY: I've had better.

394
00:32:45,393 --> 00:32:49,525
ERIC: Okay. Any scraps you've been into?

395
00:32:49,525 --> 00:32:51,347
ASHLY: What do you want, man?

396
00:32:51,347 --> 00:32:57,370
ERIC: Okay, look. I'm going to get down to
business here. I've got this girl, and we're

397
00:32:57,370 --> 00:33:01,729
looking for a guy named Garello. Maybe you've
heard of him?

398
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:03,097
ASHLY: Garello?

399
00:33:03,097 --> 00:33:13,724
ERIC: G-A-R-E-L-L-O. I got to make a delivery, and
I want to get it over with.

400
00:33:13,724 --> 00:33:19,215
ASHLY: Is this the type of thing that I can roll
to see if I have information of?

401
00:33:19,215 --> 00:33:23,236
SAM: Sure, yeah. Why don't you make an
intelligence check?

402
00:33:23,236 --> 00:33:31,398
ASHLY: That's not going to go well. What does that
stand for? That's a natural 20? Never mind. I

403
00:33:31,398 --> 00:33:34,596
haven't used these dice before.

404
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:41,340
SAM: So you don't personally know Garello, but you
are a woman about town who hears things, hears

405
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:50,806
whispers, talks with unsavory sorts. You have
heard there is a man in town, not from here, named

406
00:33:50,806 --> 00:33:59,231
Garello, who has been poking his nose around The
Ass Sailor, waiting for something. But you haven't

407
00:33:59,231 --> 00:34:00,724
met him yet.

408
00:34:00,724 --> 00:34:02,343
ASHLY: So I don't know what he looks like or
anything like that?

409
00:34:02,343 --> 00:34:06,915
SAM: No, just that he's been asking around. He's
been here before.

410
00:34:06,915 --> 00:34:09,110
LIAM: He's way up in The Ass Sailor.

411
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:12,040
BRIAN: He's ass-deep in the sailor.

412
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,976
ERIC: Well, good to know.

413
00:34:15,976 --> 00:34:27,941
BRIAN: Jayne? Picking up quickly where we left
off, I apologize for how that went. I had a wife,

414
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:37,144
Cloris, I mentioned. A child. We named our child
Denise. She was beautiful, yet expensive.

415
00:34:37,144 --> 00:34:39,891
MARY: I slowly make my way over to Frankfurt.

416
00:34:39,891 --> 00:34:47,252
BRIAN: One day, I came home and found my wife in
bed with another man. And not even a real man, a

417
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:49,114
half a man. A dwarf.

418
00:34:49,114 --> 00:34:52,804
ERIC: Oh! I spilled something on my pants.

419
00:34:52,804 --> 00:34:56,233
BRIAN: The last time I saw that dwarf, I told him
I was going to fucking kill him if I saw him

420
00:34:56,233 --> 00:35:02,741
again, and he just walked into the fucking bar.
That's him over there.

421
00:35:02,741 --> 00:35:04,278
SAM: "What is wrong with you?"

422
00:35:04,278 --> 00:35:05,936
ERIC: Hey, hey, hey.

423
00:35:05,936 --> 00:35:06,945
SAM: "What?"

424
00:35:06,945 --> 00:35:13,105
ERIC: Obby, there's a dude over there. He's
staring right at us. Don't make any moves.

425
00:35:13,105 --> 00:35:14,811
SAM: "Which dude?"

426
00:35:14,811 --> 00:35:16,494
ERIC: That guy, arms crossed.

427
00:35:16,494 --> 00:35:18,947
LIAM: So you're telling me this man has impugned
your honor.

428
00:35:18,947 --> 00:35:21,119
BRIAN: My family's honor.

429
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:27,492
ERIC: I may have fucked up. Well, not <i>me,</i> but I
fucked someone--

430
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:30,725
BRIAN: I came home and she was sitting on his
frankfurter.

431
00:35:30,725 --> 00:35:39,879
ERIC: Oh shit. You know, the T in my name stands
for "The." Frankfurt The Dwarf. I have to tell you

432
00:35:39,879 --> 00:35:41,069
a secret.

433
00:35:41,069 --> 00:35:42,796
SAM: "Do you have a beef with this gentleman?"

434
00:35:42,796 --> 00:35:44,620
BRIAN: Oh, there's beef involved, all right.

435
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,860
ERIC: Yeah, you could say that. There was beef.

436
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:49,652
BRIAN: Yeah, there was a little too much beef, if
you ask me.

437
00:35:49,652 --> 00:35:51,151
SAM: "Do you want me to go kill him?"

438
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:56,474
ERIC: You could try? Do your old pal a favor?

439
00:35:56,474 --> 00:36:01,334
BRIAN: I cast Message to Gryffin.

440
00:36:01,334 --> 00:36:03,341
SAM: Okay, sure.

441
00:36:03,341 --> 00:36:08,400
BRIAN: Can I send her a secret thing? Can I tell
her a message?

442
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,669
SAM: Yes, Message will make a whisper appear in
her ear.

443
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,149
MARY: And I can whisper back.

444
00:36:13,149 --> 00:36:14,527
SAM: Once.

445
00:36:14,527 --> 00:36:18,438
BRIAN: Gryffin, that dwarf fucked my wife.

446
00:36:18,438 --> 00:36:22,016
(laughter)

447
00:36:22,016 --> 00:36:28,201
SAM: So Gryffin, you're sitting at the bar looking
around. You don't know who just talked to you. All

448
00:36:28,201 --> 00:36:35,910
of a sudden, you hear this voice in your ear that
says, "That dwarf fucked my wife." You vaguely

449
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:42,182
have heard the voice before, but it's loud in
here. You have no idea what the fuck just

450
00:36:42,182 --> 00:36:43,841
happened.

451
00:36:43,841 --> 00:36:45,527
BRIAN: Am I allowed to add to it?

452
00:36:45,527 --> 00:36:46,745
SAM: Sure.

453
00:36:46,745 --> 00:36:56,489
BRIAN: By the way, it's me, Kingston LaForge, from
earlier. I signed the book that I wrote.

454
00:36:56,489 --> 00:36:59,260
MARY: Is that the title of your new book?

455
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,896
SAM: And the spell fades.

456
00:37:00,896 --> 00:37:03,014
(laughter)

457
00:37:03,014 --> 00:37:06,534
SAM: Expert use of Message.

458
00:37:06,534 --> 00:37:12,412
MARY: So I continue to work my way slowly, slyly,
away from the bar.

459
00:37:12,412 --> 00:37:24,576
SAM: Okay, as you travel across the room, Liam
opens a book of some sort. As you are walking

460
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:31,790
across the room, Jayne, our young girl played by
Liam O'Brien, starts eyeing Clothesline and trying

461
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:49,016
to get her eye contact. She raises an index finger
to her eyebrow and winks. I think? Oh. Yes. There

462
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:57,911
is some sort of a wink or a nod exchanged. Yes?
Okay. At which point Clothesline looks around her,

463
00:37:57,911 --> 00:38:06,565
having received some sort of a signal. To her left
is one human guard. Where the fuck did you go?

464
00:38:06,565 --> 00:38:09,177
MARY: Is that the guy you threw away?

465
00:38:09,177 --> 00:38:12,612
SAM: No, where's the tabaxi? Where is the cat
lady?

466
00:38:12,612 --> 00:38:14,159
BRIAN: Oh, she went to a table.

467
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:22,850
SAM: (laughing) Where is she? There's too many
people in here. Oh, there she is. Okay, so to her

468
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:33,364
left is one human guard ordering a drink. To her
right, one half-orc merchant. Behind her has

469
00:38:33,364 --> 00:38:37,787
wandered Zarvah the whore. And she turns.

470
00:38:37,787 --> 00:38:39,247
BRIAN: How old would you say she is?

471
00:38:39,247 --> 00:38:40,150
SAM: Who?

472
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,166
BRIAN: Zarvah the whore.

473
00:38:41,166 --> 00:38:46,006
SAM: Zarvah the whore is a tiefling. I don't know
how tiefling ageing works, so I'm going to say 30.

474
00:38:46,006 --> 00:38:48,274
(laughter)

475
00:38:48,274 --> 00:38:49,834
BRIAN: Do you know how old the other one is?

476
00:38:49,834 --> 00:38:50,692
SAM: The other whore?

477
00:38:50,692 --> 00:38:51,497
BRIAN: Yeah.

478
00:38:51,497 --> 00:38:52,654
SAM: Is older, much older.

479
00:38:52,654 --> 00:38:53,544
BRIAN: Like <i>old</i>?

480
00:38:53,544 --> 00:38:57,651
SAM: Yeah. Her name is Kay, I think.

481
00:38:57,651 --> 00:39:00,004
BRIAN: Kay is the elderly one?

482
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:06,080
SAM: Yes. Clothesline looks around. Human guard,
half-orc, Zarvah the whore. Would you like to do

483
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,841
anything, Clothesline?

484
00:39:07,841 --> 00:39:14,553
LIAM: Actually, quickly I whisper over to the
weird one and I pull out my holy symbol of the

485
00:39:14,553 --> 00:39:22,195
Lawbearer and say: there is a time and a place for
law and civilization, but your experience sounds

486
00:39:22,195 --> 00:39:26,678
trying, and I know what I would do. And I tuck the
medallion away.

487
00:39:26,678 --> 00:39:33,275
BRIAN: Look, you seem like a sweet chick, but what
the fuck were you grabbing onto? What was this?

488
00:39:33,275 --> 00:39:36,514
What is that? What is the necklace? What is that?

489
00:39:36,514 --> 00:39:38,749
LIAM: Are you not familiar with the gods?

490
00:39:38,749 --> 00:39:49,480
BRIAN: Fuck the gods! The gods?! Sarenrae's a
bitch! Kord couldn't lift a dead sparrow! The

491
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:57,118
Chained Oblivion took your mom to second base and
never called her again. Fuck the gods!

492
00:39:57,118 --> 00:40:02,336
SAM: Yes. Gryffin has arrived over at the table,
yes.

493
00:40:02,336 --> 00:40:08,854
ASHLY: Where's my movement? My speed, right?

494
00:40:08,854 --> 00:40:10,706
SAM: All right. You're fast, 30, I think?

495
00:40:10,706 --> 00:40:12,606
ASHLY: 30, yeah. Can I reach Gryffin?

496
00:40:12,606 --> 00:40:17,946
SAM: Yeah, sure. Let's see here. Five, ten. Yes,
sure. You're going to have to dodge around some

497
00:40:17,946 --> 00:40:26,315
dudes, but yeah, you can reach Gryffin. Sure.
Would you like to move there? All right. With

498
00:40:26,315 --> 00:40:33,035
cat-like grace, she leaps up onto the table, back
to there, back up on the bar, back down, back on

499
00:40:33,035 --> 00:40:36,680
the table, all the way over to Gryffin right
there.

500
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,545
LIAM: Assassin's Creed.

501
00:40:38,545 --> 00:40:41,099
MARY: With Gilbert and Sullivan playing in the
background.

502
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:46,290
SAM: And no one even hears you move, you're so
dexterous and awesome.

503
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:49,395
MARY: I'm pulling out a small bag of gold.

504
00:40:49,395 --> 00:40:54,947
ASHLY: And to immediately ruin my stealth, I go:
Sorry, Xavier! Bar fight! And I hit Gryffin.

505
00:40:54,947 --> 00:40:57,609
SAM: What did you roll?

506
00:40:57,609 --> 00:40:58,466
ASHLY: 14.

507
00:40:58,466 --> 00:41:00,172
MARY: Yeah, that hits.

508
00:41:00,172 --> 00:41:03,454
SAM: Okay. What are you attacking with? Your
claws, or--

509
00:41:03,454 --> 00:41:07,337
ASHLY: Oh yeah, what should I attack with? I'll
attack with my claws.

510
00:41:07,337 --> 00:41:09,721
SAM: Claws. So plus, what is it? Five?

511
00:41:09,721 --> 00:41:10,679
ASHLY: Five. Yeah.

512
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:20,206
SAM: So it's a 19, right? Okay. That hits. Okay.
This is <i>it</i>. So the words "bar fight" ring out,

513
00:41:20,206 --> 00:41:30,600
everyone turns, looks to the source of the action
over there at the table, and with razor-like

514
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:37,278
claws-- right? You did a claw attack? Digging into
the back of your head, Gryffin, you feel intense

515
00:41:37,278 --> 00:41:39,385
pain, and roll for damage.

516
00:41:39,385 --> 00:41:42,486
ASHLY: That is a five.

517
00:41:42,486 --> 00:41:50,684
SAM: Five. Take five hit points off there, Gryff.
You feel these claws dig into the back of your

518
00:41:50,684 --> 00:42:00,479
head, you feel blood trickling down your neck. It
sucks. What would you like to do, Gryffin?

519
00:42:00,479 --> 00:42:13,306
MARY: I turn and I cast Reduce.

520
00:42:13,306 --> 00:42:19,045
SAM: Reduce? Not familiar with that one. Oh,
Reduce Size!

521
00:42:19,045 --> 00:42:20,121
MARY: Reduce Size!

522
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:26,176
SAM: Yes! I am familiar with that one. Okay, as
you do that, I need everyone to roll initiative.

523
00:42:26,176 --> 00:42:29,683
It is a bar fight.

524
00:42:29,683 --> 00:42:32,306
ASHLY: 14.

525
00:42:32,306 --> 00:42:35,674
MARY: Natural 20! Thanks for not fucking me, Gil!

526
00:42:35,674 --> 00:42:46,464
SAM: Oh god! Okay. Everyone get your numbers in
your head. I'm going to roll for about seven other

527
00:42:46,464 --> 00:43:06,130
people. Okay. Sure. Uh-huh. Oh yeah. Yep. Uh-huh.
Oh, not good. Not good. Uh-huh.

528
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:12,502
BRIAN: Guys, don't forget to get the Tal'Dorei
Campaign Guide book, available from Green Ronin

529
00:43:12,502 --> 00:43:14,293
Publishers, Inc.

530
00:43:14,293 --> 00:43:18,682
LIAM: And a special shout-out to Dwarven Forge for
sending me all this shit two days ago!

531
00:43:18,682 --> 00:43:21,341
BRIAN: Thank you, Dwarven Forge, for the awesome
mappage.

532
00:43:21,341 --> 00:43:27,134
SAM: All right. Give me your numbers. Anyone from
20 to 25?

533
00:43:27,134 --> 00:43:28,883
MARY: 20. Natural 20.

534
00:43:28,883 --> 00:43:36,913
SAM: Ooh, okay. Where are you? You're down here.
Great. Who's next? Anyone from 20 to 25, anyone

535
00:43:36,913 --> 00:43:38,367
from 15 to 20?

536
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,491
LIAM: 16.

537
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:47,631
SAM: 16. Okay. Good. Yes. Anyone else 15 to 20?
No? Ten to 15?

538
00:43:47,631 --> 00:43:49,102
ASHLY: 14. Sorry.

539
00:43:49,102 --> 00:43:50,189
ERIC: Go for it.

540
00:43:50,189 --> 00:43:51,447
ASHLY: 14, yeah.

541
00:43:51,447 --> 00:43:52,461
ERIC: 13.

542
00:43:52,461 --> 00:43:54,653
SAM: 13. Frankfurt, what do you got?

543
00:43:54,653 --> 00:43:57,571
BRIAN: That'd be a three. That would be a big old
three.

544
00:43:57,571 --> 00:43:59,246
SAM: Gnarly!

545
00:43:59,246 --> 00:44:07,983
BRIAN: (singing) Roll a little three in Kingston
town! Down, down, down to Kingston town.

546
00:44:07,983 --> 00:44:17,290
SAM: Let me do the order here. (singing) There are
so many people in this bar! Why would I do this to

547
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:27,983
myself? (speaking) Yep. This was a bad idea. Okay.
Nine.

548
00:44:27,983 --> 00:44:30,360
BRIAN: This is your Liam's beach, Sam.

549
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:41,036
SAM: Yep! Okay, good. We got 13 people to keep
track of. Great. All right, here we go! Wait, I

550
00:44:41,195 --> 00:44:45,470
got some battle music playing. Is it playing?
Sure. I don't know. I don't know what any of this

551
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:54,353
shit is. (giggles) Okay. You cast Reduce. Your
spell DC is what?

552
00:44:54,353 --> 00:45:02,385
MARY: Exactly! (mumbling) But where's the spell
DC?

553
00:45:02,385 --> 00:45:05,422
BRIAN: Right here.

554
00:45:05,422 --> 00:45:06,694
MARY: 14.

555
00:45:06,694 --> 00:45:14,362
SAM: Okay. Oh, you have to save. Is it a
constitution save? Do you know? I can look.

556
00:45:14,362 --> 00:45:18,416
BRIAN: It's on the card, too. Oh yeah, you got it
here.

557
00:45:18,416 --> 00:45:19,801
MARY: Yeah, it's a concentration.

558
00:45:19,801 --> 00:45:22,750
SAM: Concentration?

559
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:24,024
BRIAN: Yeah, constitution saving throw.

560
00:45:24,024 --> 00:45:26,869
SAM: So roll 20, add your constitution save
modifier.

561
00:45:26,869 --> 00:45:28,194
ASHLY: 19.

562
00:45:28,194 --> 00:45:34,852
SAM: A blast of sorcerous energy comes out of
Gryffin's hands? What do you use to cast things?

563
00:45:34,852 --> 00:45:36,127
MARY: My hands!

564
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:44,075
SAM: Your hands. And the magical energy passes
right through you, it's a burst of strange

565
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:49,152
tingling sensation that bursts right past your
face, but you shake off the effects and nothing

566
00:45:49,152 --> 00:45:50,360
happens.

567
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:52,274
MARY: So I didn't need to roll to attack?

568
00:45:52,274 --> 00:46:01,562
SAM: That's a spell, yes? So you don't roll on
spells, I don't believe. Unless I'm wrong about

569
00:46:01,562 --> 00:46:02,704
these things?

570
00:46:02,704 --> 00:46:03,862
LIAM: Which is the spell?

571
00:46:03,862 --> 00:46:09,107
SAM: It's not a ranged attack, Reduce, right? It's
just a spell. Does it say ranged attack or

572
00:46:09,107 --> 00:46:10,265
anything?

573
00:46:10,265 --> 00:46:13,948
BRIAN: Yeah, no. It's 30 feet.

574
00:46:13,948 --> 00:46:18,665
SAM: I don't know how to play, and I don't know
how to DM. I would appreciate that we hold all

575
00:46:18,665 --> 00:46:20,478
questions to the end of the session.

576
00:46:20,478 --> 00:46:24,190
LIAM: Don't worry, there are people tweeting
advice right now that you can see

577
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:25,315
three hours later.

578
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:31,513
MARY: Because I thought I always would roll for
attack, whether it's a spell or not? I don't know.

579
00:46:31,513 --> 00:46:34,362
SAM: Not tonight, Mary.

580
00:46:34,362 --> 00:46:37,668
MARY: So everything is going to be 15 all night,
with all the spells?

581
00:46:37,668 --> 00:46:42,511
SAM: No, that's your spell save DC, right? You
have a spell save DC, it's on page two of your thing.

582
00:46:42,511 --> 00:46:48,337
LIAM: The <i>target</i> makes a constitution save for
this one.

583
00:46:48,337 --> 00:46:55,222
SAM: For spells like Chromatic Orb or other
things, those are ranged attacks that you roll for

584
00:46:55,222 --> 00:47:01,418
your attack. Reduce is just a thing that happens.
You don't have to target anyone.

585
00:47:01,418 --> 00:47:02,963
LIAM: Are you shrinking yourself or someone else?

586
00:47:02,963 --> 00:47:04,211
MARY: No, someone else.

587
00:47:04,211 --> 00:47:05,957
LIAM: So you have to make a constitution save.

588
00:47:05,957 --> 00:47:09,978
ASHLY: I did, and I cannot be shrunk! I'm
unshrinkable.

589
00:47:09,978 --> 00:47:22,620
SAM: Okay. So nothing happened. But it is your
round, Gryffin. That was a surprise attack. No, it

590
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:25,544
wasn't a surprise attack, you fucking attacked
first. So you still get a bonus action and a move

591
00:47:25,544 --> 00:47:26,910
if you would like.

592
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:34,474
MARY: Yes! But it has to be a specific bonus
action.

593
00:47:34,474 --> 00:47:38,252
SAM: If you have a spell that you can cast as a
bonus action.

594
00:47:38,252 --> 00:47:42,822
MARY: I don't think I do. And I can't do any
cantrips as a bonus action, can I?

595
00:47:42,822 --> 00:47:45,275
SAM: You do have one bonus action spell.

596
00:47:45,275 --> 00:47:46,638
MARY: Which is?

597
00:47:46,638 --> 00:47:48,276
SAM: Misty Step.

598
00:47:48,276 --> 00:47:50,126
MARY: Yes, but I don't want to use that now.

599
00:47:50,126 --> 00:47:56,720
LIAM: And in Matt's world and homebrew, bonus
action, you can use a cantrip on, right? Since I

600
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:57,855
don't do spells a lot.

601
00:47:57,855 --> 00:48:02,965
SAM: No. But if you really want to, I'll let you,
because I don't care.

602
00:48:02,965 --> 00:48:04,766
(laughter)

603
00:48:04,766 --> 00:48:06,566
SAM: Sure, why not.

604
00:48:06,566 --> 00:48:08,161
MARY: Then I cast Firebolt!

605
00:48:08,161 --> 00:48:09,730
SAM: Firebolt. At whom?

606
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:11,393
MARY: At this lovely cat!

607
00:48:11,393 --> 00:48:15,938
SAM: All right. This <i>is</i> a ranged spell. You roll
for your attack.

608
00:48:15,938 --> 00:48:18,175
BRIAN: You're doing great, Sam.

609
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:19,449
SAM: I am <i>doing</i>.

610
00:48:19,449 --> 00:48:22,061
MARY: I'm going to use Tides of Chaos.

611
00:48:22,061 --> 00:48:29,087
SAM: Tides of Chaos? Yeah, I hear you. Tides of
Chaos is a sorcerer feature.

612
00:48:29,087 --> 00:48:31,520
MARY: Do I add anything to that?

613
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,094
SAM: Yeah, plus six. That's your spell attack
bonus.

614
00:48:34,094 --> 00:48:35,822
MARY: Yes. So 18.

615
00:48:35,822 --> 00:48:39,949
SAM: 18. This is versus an armor class, I
believe.

616
00:48:39,949 --> 00:48:42,199
MARY: Which is 19, so I miss <i>again</i>.

617
00:48:42,199 --> 00:48:44,508
ASHLY: Eat it, magic!

618
00:48:44,508 --> 00:48:47,343
MARY: But I did roll Tides of the Chaos.

619
00:48:47,343 --> 00:48:49,323
SAM: You did. Which gives you advantage.

620
00:48:49,323 --> 00:48:51,037
MARY: I did, and that was it.

621
00:48:51,037 --> 00:49:01,115
SAM: Fuck! This tabaxi is tough. So you take a
deep breath, Mary, Gryffin, and you say, "Oh, I'm

622
00:49:01,115 --> 00:49:05,778
"going to get you this time!" And you cast another
spell, which, again-- a tingling sensation passes

623
00:49:05,778 --> 00:49:09,571
over your face, as the tabaxi shakes it off.
Nothing happened.

624
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:12,054
ASHLY: That was a nice tickle. Thanks, Gryffin!

625
00:49:12,054 --> 00:49:14,434
SAM: You still have movement, if you'd like to
make it.

626
00:49:14,434 --> 00:49:15,936
MARY: Yes, I'd like to move behind the bar.

627
00:49:15,936 --> 00:49:17,148
SAM: Okay.

628
00:49:17,148 --> 00:49:20,494
BRIAN: Did you need a tickle? Did I hear you
wanted to be tickled?

629
00:49:20,494 --> 00:49:22,149
ASHLY: Kingston, not now!

630
00:49:22,149 --> 00:49:24,476
SAM: You're going to move over here?

631
00:49:24,476 --> 00:49:26,260
MARY: Can I go behind the bar?

632
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:28,734
SAM: Oh! Sure. Oh, let's see, what's your
movement?

633
00:49:28,734 --> 00:49:30,018
MARY: 30.

634
00:49:30,018 --> 00:49:37,362
SAM: Okay, yeah. Then you can make it right there.
And as you go, Clothesline gets an attack of

635
00:49:37,362 --> 00:49:42,258
opportunity. Not a clothesline attack, because
that takes movement, but other things you can do.

636
00:49:42,258 --> 00:49:43,734
ASHLY: Okay. I can claw her again?

637
00:49:43,734 --> 00:49:46,248
SAM: You can claw her again. Roll for an attack.

638
00:49:46,248 --> 00:49:52,040
ASHLY: I forgot how to play DND. It is a nine.

639
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,886
BRIAN: Can I inspire her? On her attack?

640
00:49:54,886 --> 00:50:00,258
SAM: No, you have to do that before. Inspire, you
can't use a reaction. What did you say?

641
00:50:00,258 --> 00:50:03,949
ASHLY: I got a four on my d20. Don't work.

642
00:50:03,949 --> 00:50:09,407
SAM: Yes, no, absolutely not. Clothesline takes a
swipe and only just gets a little shock of blonde

643
00:50:09,407 --> 00:50:10,953
hair in her claws.

644
00:50:10,953 --> 00:50:12,798
MARY: Sorry, kitty-kitty-kitty!

645
00:50:12,798 --> 00:50:18,655
SAM: Ooh. They're already so feisty against each
other! I love it! And you get away safely. Next

646
00:50:18,655 --> 00:50:26,479
up, everyone in the bar turns to see that there is
some fighting going on. Many patrons of the bar

647
00:50:26,479 --> 00:50:32,965
who are regulars just sort of say: "Shit!" and
don't really react very much. There're some

648
00:50:32,965 --> 00:50:38,446
newbies in the bar who are on edge, they start
moving around; there's a hustle and bustle, they

649
00:50:38,446 --> 00:50:44,033
start going across the bar to get their weapons.
Let's say that this fine young cannibal over here

650
00:50:44,033 --> 00:50:45,880
starts moving to get her weapons.

651
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,629
BRIAN: Is that where they are?

652
00:50:47,629 --> 00:50:53,318
SAM: The weapons are over here near the front
door. And let's say that this gentleman moves over

653
00:50:53,318 --> 00:51:01,857
to the front door to grab his weapon. Let's see
here, that takes care of... so she's done. Who's

654
00:51:01,857 --> 00:51:09,986
three? No one goes third. What the fuck? There's
no three. All right, so we go straight to four.

655
00:51:09,986 --> 00:51:16,906
She doesn't do anything, she's just moving. Okay.
Jayne-- No, that's not true. Yes, it is! Jayne,

656
00:51:16,906 --> 00:51:20,069
you are up. It is your turn to act and strike.

657
00:51:20,069 --> 00:51:26,687
LIAM: Okay. So I cast the spell Command, which has
a range of 60 feet, on the little red-haired girl.

658
00:51:26,687 --> 00:51:32,118
And I will say: Approach. And she has to make a
wisdom saving throw.

659
00:51:32,118 --> 00:51:37,560
SAM: Oh snap! On the little girl? On Holly, the
little girl? Who hasn't said a thing or done a

660
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:38,760
thing to you yet?

661
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,077
BRIAN: That's the one that came in with you?

662
00:51:40,077 --> 00:51:41,165
ERIC: Damn it! Yes.

663
00:51:41,165 --> 00:51:42,297
SAM: Yes, the two dwarves.

664
00:51:42,297 --> 00:51:47,374
LIAM: She has to beat a 14. Wisdom.

665
00:51:47,374 --> 00:51:52,887
SAM: Let me find her. On a what save?

666
00:51:52,887 --> 00:51:54,285
LIAM: Wisdom.

667
00:51:54,285 --> 00:52:00,722
SAM: What did you say she has to beat?

668
00:52:00,722 --> 00:52:01,916
LIAM: 14.

669
00:52:01,916 --> 00:52:06,020
SAM: She does not beat 14. So what are the effects
of this spell?

670
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:09,929
LIAM: Approach means she has to come toward me on
her turn.

671
00:52:09,929 --> 00:52:11,072
SAM: On her next move?

672
00:52:11,072 --> 00:52:15,722
LIAM: On her every turn, until the spell gets
interrupted. And then I would like to use my

673
00:52:15,722 --> 00:52:18,715
movement to start moving toward the door as far as
I can get.

674
00:52:18,715 --> 00:52:21,308
SAM: All right. How fast can you move?

675
00:52:21,308 --> 00:52:27,788
LIAM: 30 feet. So five, ten. It's crowded. You
could probably slow it down a little bit.

676
00:52:27,788 --> 00:52:34,220
SAM: Yeah, you had to get up, you had to walk over
there. Let's say you get about this far, near the

677
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:38,922
dog. And the little girl is right here. She hasn't
moved yet, but on her turn she will.

678
00:52:38,922 --> 00:52:43,054
LIAM: And before all that happened and people were
running to what? To grab their weapons to be part

679
00:52:43,054 --> 00:52:45,173
of this bloodbath?

680
00:52:45,173 --> 00:52:46,888
SAM: To defend themselves if needed.

681
00:52:46,888 --> 00:52:49,549
LIAM: Yes. Does anyone have a hand on a weapon
yet?

682
00:52:49,549 --> 00:52:53,370
SAM: Absolutely. The guard right here has drawn
his sword.

683
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:54,973
LIAM: Yes. What about by the door?

684
00:52:54,973 --> 00:53:02,435
SAM: By the door? This guy has been guarding the
weapons, and he holds a longsword, and he had it

685
00:53:02,435 --> 00:53:08,670
already readied before the fighting even started.
He's a paid hired hand to guard the door.

686
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:14,494
LIAM: Then I'm just going to use my bonus action
to yank the belt off of me, which is actually a

687
00:53:14,494 --> 00:53:17,170
white whip, and crack it on the floor, and that's
the end of my turn.

688
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:20,050
SAM: Does that do something?

689
00:53:20,050 --> 00:53:22,499
LIAM: Just flair, baby.

690
00:53:22,499 --> 00:53:24,771
(laughter)

691
00:53:24,771 --> 00:53:34,405
SAM: Oh snap! Okay, that ends your turn, Jayne.
Okay, who is next? Okay. Valerie, the bartender,

692
00:53:34,405 --> 00:53:42,002
does not like this, and she does not like someone
coming behind her bar. So she is going to move

693
00:53:42,002 --> 00:53:52,654
over and attack Gryffin. Let's see what she's got.
She's not armed, currently, so she is going to

694
00:53:52,654 --> 00:54:00,574
roll a punch attack. That's an 18. Does that hit?

695
00:54:00,574 --> 00:54:01,675
MARY: It does.

696
00:54:01,675 --> 00:54:10,957
SAM: Okay. She's not a martial weapon person; I
think that's one point of damage. She smacks you

697
00:54:10,957 --> 00:54:14,663
in the face and says: "Don't come back here! This
is the bar!"

698
00:54:14,663 --> 00:54:22,181
MARY: Gryffin's eye starts to twitch a little bit
as she feels things welling up inside of her.

699
00:54:22,181 --> 00:54:31,120
SAM: Oh boy. It's not going great for you. Let's
see here, who is next? Five, that's six, seven.

700
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:38,037
Seven, who is seven? Why did I write two sixes?
Clothesline! It is your turn.

701
00:54:38,037 --> 00:54:39,834
ASHLY: What's up? Okay. Where am I?

702
00:54:39,834 --> 00:54:45,260
SAM: You're right over here. You just made a swipe
attack on Gryffin as she left. You're near

703
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:54,240
Kingston, and you saw Jayne get up and walk away
after she gave you the signal.

704
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:57,486
ASHLY: Okay. And Frankfurt is adjacent to me as
well, right?

705
00:54:57,486 --> 00:55:03,380
SAM: Frankfurt is pretty close to you, yeah. He's
instinctively put his hand on his weapon, and his

706
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:08,031
other hand is starting to clutch the girl's arm,
the girl Holly.

707
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:09,817
ERIC: That's my cargo.

708
00:55:09,817 --> 00:55:11,102
BRIAN: What is his weapon?

709
00:55:11,102 --> 00:55:12,452
SAM: What is your weapon?

710
00:55:12,452 --> 00:55:13,799
ERIC: Hot dog buns.

711
00:55:13,799 --> 00:55:18,591
BRIAN: That could be brought down with some
water.

712
00:55:18,591 --> 00:55:21,363
ERIC: My buns!

713
00:55:21,363 --> 00:55:26,150
ASHLY: Okay. I'm going to attack this guard with
his sword drawn.

714
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:33,814
SAM: Okay. So you're going to move over here,
yeah? 15 feet of movement or something. And you

715
00:55:33,814 --> 00:55:35,216
attack with what?

716
00:55:35,216 --> 00:55:39,234
ASHLY: I want to clothesline him.

717
00:55:39,234 --> 00:55:42,136
SAM: Sure. Yeah. So you've used ten feet of
movement.

718
00:55:42,136 --> 00:55:47,198
ASHLY: 18. The lesson there is I should only try
to clothesline people.

719
00:55:47,198 --> 00:55:54,415
SAM: That is a definite hit. So the tabaxi runs,
full sprint, ten feet across, holding her arm out

720
00:55:54,415 --> 00:56:00,914
in a clothesline motion and makes a huge impact
with the guy's neck. Roll for damage.

721
00:56:00,914 --> 00:56:02,159
ASHLY: That's a five.

722
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:03,953
SAM: Five damage, okay.

723
00:56:03,953 --> 00:56:05,340
BRIAN: Well done!

724
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:07,207
ASHLY: You're next, man!

725
00:56:07,207 --> 00:56:09,915
BRIAN: Bring it to me, hard and fast!

726
00:56:09,915 --> 00:56:16,878
SAM: So the guard is a regular, and he looks up at
you and says, "What the hell, Clothesline?"

727
00:56:16,878 --> 00:56:18,752
ASHLY: I'm sorry, man!

728
00:56:18,752 --> 00:56:22,545
SAM: Would you like to do anything on your bonus
action? Is there anything?

729
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:31,820
ASHLY: Who else has swords drawn? This other guy,
right?

730
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:39,620
SAM: Which guy? This orc guy? Yeah, this half-orc
guy, let's say he's got something. What does he

731
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:44,380
have? Nope, nope, he doesn't have any weapons. I
wrote it down that way, so that's how it is.

732
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:48,481
ASHLY: I'm going to jump on the table and go
(snarls) to make things feel crazier.

733
00:56:48,481 --> 00:56:57,223
SAM: Okay. So you do a catlike roar on the table.
(hisses) The four or five people near you look up

734
00:56:57,223 --> 00:57:05,884
at you, totally baffled at what the fuck is going
on right now. One guy, who is a regular, grabs his

735
00:57:05,884 --> 00:57:12,572
drink and sips it; he doesn't give a shit. Okay.
Next up. That was Clothesline. Next is Kingston's

736
00:57:12,572 --> 00:57:16,753
turn! Kingston. What would you like to do. Oh,
Kingston! Kingston is over here, sorry.

737
00:57:16,753 --> 00:57:20,650
BRIAN: Actually, he rolled higher than me. For
initiative? I'm three.

738
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:27,484
SAM: Oh, I wrote down 13 for Kingston and three
for Frankfurt, but it's the opposite? So 13 for

739
00:57:27,484 --> 00:57:30,693
Frankfurt, three for Kingston. Sorry about that.

740
00:57:30,693 --> 00:57:31,898
ERIC: It's okay.

741
00:57:31,898 --> 00:57:34,123
LIAM: How many shows are you directing right now?
72?

742
00:57:34,123 --> 00:57:42,571
SAM: All of them. Okay, sorry. Sorry. I get you
guys confused because of your stupid names. So

743
00:57:42,571 --> 00:57:51,605
Frankfurt, it is <i>your</i> turn. There is chaos all
around you, the girl is sitting there harmlessly.

744
00:57:51,605 --> 00:57:55,942
She's a little frightened, but there's a lot of
action; lot of movement.

745
00:57:55,942 --> 00:58:05,994
ERIC: I mean, I have a feeling that Kingston knows
what I did to his wife. With his wife.

746
00:58:05,994 --> 00:58:08,317
SAM: On his wife.

747
00:58:08,317 --> 00:58:13,839
ERIC: Last summer. I feel like I might try to
start some shit with Kingston.

748
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:22,138
SAM: Okay. So seeing his opportunity, Frankfurt
leaves the side of the little girl and runs across

749
00:58:22,138 --> 00:58:25,588
the room, using your awesome dwarf speed. How fast
can you move?

750
00:58:25,588 --> 00:58:26,689
ERIC: 25.

751
00:58:26,689 --> 00:58:28,725
SAM: 25. This is you, the gold guy, by the way,
Eric.

752
00:58:28,725 --> 00:58:31,983
ERIC: But is Obby still protecting her?

753
00:58:31,983 --> 00:58:38,281
SAM: Obby is still protecting her. I will say she
was sitting in between you two. Obby is calm. So

754
00:58:38,281 --> 00:58:41,992
you go over, and you attack. Are you doing a
weapon attack?

755
00:58:41,992 --> 00:58:44,197
ERIC: I'm going to use my maul.

756
00:58:44,197 --> 00:58:48,263
SAM: So roll a d20 and add your plus something to
it.

757
00:58:48,263 --> 00:58:55,147
ERIC: Okay. I'm rolling. 18.

758
00:58:55,147 --> 00:59:01,261
SAM: 18? I'm sure that hits you, right, dude?
Wait, you <i>rolled</i> an 18?

759
00:59:01,261 --> 00:59:02,436
ERIC: I rolled an 18.

760
00:59:02,436 --> 00:59:03,755
BRIAN: Wait, is that a melee attack?

761
00:59:03,755 --> 00:59:08,093
SAM: Yeah, he hits you. Yeah. So roll for damage.

762
00:59:08,093 --> 00:59:12,634
ERIC: Oh! And that's this one?

763
00:59:12,634 --> 00:59:23,218
SAM: What does it say? Hold on. Your maul is 2d6
plus six! This is a big, fat weapon. Two-handed

764
00:59:23,218 --> 00:59:31,911
strike comes down right on the top of your head.
Full force. This guy is a bruiser. So roll 2d6. Or

765
00:59:31,911 --> 00:59:33,754
1d6 twice.

766
00:59:33,754 --> 00:59:36,793
LIAM: Is this the maul? That's six two times.

767
00:59:36,793 --> 00:59:38,293
ERIC: Okay. So this one?

768
00:59:38,293 --> 00:59:45,321
LIAM: The square. Traditional die. And one more
time. A six!

769
00:59:45,321 --> 00:59:47,660
SAM: Oh my god! You're fucking dead, dude.

770
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:50,048
LIAM: Two, that's eight, plus six.

771
00:59:50,048 --> 00:59:56,535
SAM: 14 points of damage. Kingston, still reeling
from getting dissed by several ladies tonight,

772
00:59:56,535 --> 01:00:02,836
didn't really even look, and all of a sudden a
maul cracks down on his skull, sending him to his

773
01:00:02,836 --> 01:00:09,270
knees. Are you okay? Kingston is not doing great.

774
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:11,446
ERIC: No hard feelings.

775
01:00:11,446 --> 01:00:17,370
BRIAN: Just you wait. When I get up from this
ground!

776
01:00:17,370 --> 01:00:26,422
SAM: Because I don't know what the fuck I'm doing:
on your knees, Kingston-- by the way, sorry. Would

777
01:00:26,422 --> 01:00:31,919
you like to use any bonus actions, Mr. Frankfurt?
You don't have to.

778
01:00:31,919 --> 01:00:37,624
LIAM: Your Hunter's Mark is a bonus action, I seem
to recall.

779
01:00:37,624 --> 01:00:43,400
SAM: You could have used before, or you could
put it on somebody else. Also, forgive me.

780
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:50,136
Hunter's Mark, he has something similar that is a
paladin feature, I think, that doesn't use a spell

781
01:00:50,136 --> 01:00:52,219
slot. Vow of Enmity, is that a thing?

782
01:00:52,219 --> 01:00:58,573
LIAM: That's big time. Yeah, that gives him
advantage on every attack against one target. So

783
01:00:58,573 --> 01:01:04,127
if you really want to fuck that guy up, do Vow of
Enmity. But I think that's an action.

784
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:05,672
SAM: I don't know.

785
01:01:05,672 --> 01:01:13,104
ERIC: It sounds a bit too complicated. I'm a
little satisfied with what I did just now.

786
01:01:13,104 --> 01:01:14,239
BRIAN: Yeah.

787
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:15,320
SAM: You're satisfied?

788
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:16,220
ERIC: Yeah.

789
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:18,625
BRIAN: My wife wasn't satisfied!

790
01:01:18,625 --> 01:01:20,182
SAM: Oh shit!

791
01:01:20,182 --> 01:01:28,826
ERIC: I've got video. Do I stay in that area?

792
01:01:28,826 --> 01:01:32,989
SAM: You can move a little bit. I think you have
five or ten more feet of movement.

793
01:01:32,989 --> 01:01:36,614
ERIC: Head back towards Holly.

794
01:01:36,614 --> 01:01:44,103
LIAM: Vow of Enmity, bonus action. If you want to
destroy Kingston. It gives you advantage. Vow of

795
01:01:44,103 --> 01:01:50,362
Enmity. One time tonight you can say, that person,
and then you can roll with burning hatred.

796
01:01:50,362 --> 01:01:55,707
Religious hatred. You know, the religious hatred.

797
01:01:55,707 --> 01:02:08,090
SAM: So keep that in your back pocket. Frankfurt
goes back towards the girl, keeping her protected

798
01:02:08,090 --> 01:02:24,104
from badness. That was Frankfurt. At this point,
the old bald man who was arguing with the whore

799
01:02:24,104 --> 01:02:38,369
uses this as an opportunity to flee, and starts
running for the door. He's moving this way. Zarvah

800
01:02:38,369 --> 01:02:42,496
the whore sees this happening and starts bolting
to catch him.

801
01:02:42,496 --> 01:02:44,892
BRIAN: Don't leave!

802
01:02:44,892 --> 01:02:50,513
MARY: All the plants will die!

803
01:02:50,513 --> 01:02:52,857
BRIAN: I'm going to be done with this so soon.

804
01:02:52,857 --> 01:03:01,339
SAM: This guy over here, who was eating mutton
before. He's got his weapon now and he turns to

805
01:03:01,339 --> 01:03:07,731
anyone who's available to him, which is the
easiest target in the area, which is Jayne, a

806
01:03:07,731 --> 01:03:13,413
small girl. Mutton Man has--

807
01:03:13,413 --> 01:03:17,680
LIAM: Do you know the Mutton Man?

808
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:24,955
SAM: He sees you running for the door; he thinks
this is fun. This is his favorite thing, is bar

809
01:03:24,955 --> 01:03:38,880
room brawls. He is going to roll a 14 plus five,
19 versus strength. No, he's trying to grapple you.

810
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:42,248
LIAM: Versus strength. Oh, that does it.

811
01:03:42,248 --> 01:03:49,301
SAM: You are grappled by the Mutton Man. He grabs you
and says, "Not so fast, dear, we're going to have

812
01:03:49,301 --> 01:03:55,623
"some fun tonight." You are restrained for right
now. You cannot move.

813
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:57,747
BRIAN: Do you know that Muffin Man?

814
01:03:57,747 --> 01:04:00,120
MARY and ASHLY: (singing) Do you know the muffin
man?

815
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:06,008
SAM: So you are grappled. Ooh! I have a thing! You
are grappled!

816
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:11,047
(cheering)

817
01:04:11,047 --> 01:04:13,418
LIAM: It matches my albino, even!

818
01:04:13,418 --> 01:04:21,013
SAM: That's the Mutton Man. Now we go to Kingston.
Kingston, before your roll, you have dropped to

819
01:04:21,013 --> 01:04:27,345
your knees. You are feeling like shit. You open
your eyes; roll a perception check.

820
01:04:27,345 --> 01:04:37,497
BRIAN: Don't fuck me, Gil. I can't tell what it
is. 12?

821
01:04:37,497 --> 01:04:44,732
SAM: 12, okay. You see the table in front of you;
you've fallen facing the table. Under the table in

822
01:04:44,732 --> 01:04:47,933
front of you is a small vial of something
underneath it.

823
01:04:47,933 --> 01:04:49,467
BRIAN: I grab the fuck out of it.

824
01:04:49,467 --> 01:04:59,497
SAM: That is going to take some of your movement.
You could grab it; that's fine. You grab it. I got

825
01:04:59,497 --> 01:05:09,890
stuff. I got presents. Let's do this, because I'm
a kind god. (laughing) You recognize one of these;

826
01:05:09,890 --> 01:05:15,674
you've seen them before: it's a potion of healing.
Someone must have dropped it in the scrum, so it's

827
01:05:15,674 --> 01:05:18,735
there for you if you need it. What would you like
to do on your action?

828
01:05:18,735 --> 01:05:24,896
BRIAN: Is standing up going to take my movement?
Half my movement? Okay. I'll stand up and then

829
01:05:24,896 --> 01:05:27,337
where is Frankfurt?

830
01:05:27,337 --> 01:05:29,701
SAM: Frankfurt is pretty close to you.

831
01:05:29,701 --> 01:05:31,803
BRIAN: Okay, I'm going to cast Blindness on
Frankfurt.

832
01:05:31,803 --> 01:05:36,276
SAM: Blindness? Okay, what is your spell save DC?

833
01:05:36,276 --> 01:05:40,299
BRIAN: That way he thinks he's going home with
someone's wife, but he's going home with someone's

834
01:05:40,299 --> 01:05:45,824
mule. My spell save DC is a 14.

835
01:05:45,824 --> 01:05:50,265
SAM: 14. Is Blindness a constitution or wisdom
save?

836
01:05:50,265 --> 01:05:52,511
BRIAN: It is a constitution save.

837
01:05:52,511 --> 01:05:57,752
SAM: So Eric, you need to roll a d20 and add your
constitution save modifier, which Liam will point

838
01:05:57,752 --> 01:06:00,978
out to you right now. Constitution save.

839
01:06:00,978 --> 01:06:03,778
LIAM: Constitution save is right here. Plus four
to whatever you roll.

840
01:06:03,778 --> 01:06:05,393
SAM: So roll something.

841
01:06:05,393 --> 01:06:09,226
ERIC: Now hold on a minute. I love vision.

842
01:06:09,226 --> 01:06:12,261
LIAM: Oh yeah, 20.

843
01:06:12,261 --> 01:06:19,447
SAM: 20. A prickling in your neck, Frankfurt, as
you feel some sort of magical effect starting to

844
01:06:19,447 --> 01:06:24,665
take hold but you burp and shake it off like
nothing happened.

845
01:06:24,665 --> 01:06:30,279
ERIC: (burps, laughs) I've never played before.

846
01:06:30,279 --> 01:06:33,052
BRIAN: You're doing great.

847
01:06:33,052 --> 01:06:35,946
SAM: Kingston, you still have a bonus action.

848
01:06:35,946 --> 01:06:38,046
BRIAN: I'll take this potion as my bonus action.

849
01:06:38,046 --> 01:06:41,379
SAM: Okay. It's a 2d4 plus what?

850
01:06:41,379 --> 01:06:43,428
BRIAN: 4d4 plus four.

851
01:06:43,428 --> 01:06:46,044
MARY: It's a greater healing.

852
01:06:46,044 --> 01:06:48,973
SAM: Yeah. Well, I don't want him to die already.

853
01:06:48,973 --> 01:07:06,939
BRIAN: Getting pretty close there for a second.
All right. 4d4. 14. Yeah, not bad. 11 plus four so 15.

854
01:07:07,036 --> 01:07:21,240
SAM: All right. Lucky. All right, so that takes
care of all you guys, I think. The half-orc who

855
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:26,487
you did not attack sees you on the bar, sees that
it's going to be fun, and is going to try to pull

856
01:07:26,487 --> 01:07:39,333
you down off the bar. He will roll a 14 plus
something. I don't know what. Just a 14. I'm going

857
01:07:39,333 --> 01:07:45,938
to say straight 14. No, this would be a strength
check. He's pretty strong so I'm going to add four

858
01:07:45,938 --> 01:07:52,372
to that? 18 versus strength. Strength save. 20
plus your strength.

859
01:07:52,372 --> 01:07:55,164
ASHLY: (singing) Critical roll symbol, so natural
20.

860
01:07:55,164 --> 01:08:03,547
SAM: Holy shit! So the half-orc grabs for your
catlike ankles and you see the grab coming, and

861
01:08:03,547 --> 01:08:11,085
you kick your half-drunk saucer of milk right in
his face. He's distracted and gets a whiff of air;

862
01:08:11,085 --> 01:08:19,904
doesn't grab any fur or anything. That ends his
turn. Anybody else? Okay. There's one other person

863
01:08:19,904 --> 01:08:28,335
who moves, and she's picking up a weapon. That is
the top of the round-- Oh no! Obby the dwarf. Obby

864
01:08:28,335 --> 01:08:35,324
the Rat. Okay, Obby is going to go across to the
girl, take a couple steps closer to the girl

865
01:08:35,324 --> 01:08:41,072
because that's what he's being paid here for. Grab
her by the arm and hold his action until someone

866
01:08:41,072 --> 01:08:43,119
tries to attack the girl.

867
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:44,384
ASHLY: Does Holly move?

868
01:08:44,384 --> 01:08:50,180
SAM: Holly can move. Shit, I never rolled for
initiative for Holly! Okay, so she should have

869
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:55,043
gone a while ago. Fuck! Let's just say she was so
confused she's only going now.

870
01:08:55,043 --> 01:08:58,409
BRIAN: Can you describe to me what she's wearing
and if she's carrying anything?

871
01:08:58,409 --> 01:09:06,186
SAM: Holly is wearing a simple gray raw silk tunic
with a belt around it. She is-- let me see,

872
01:09:06,186 --> 01:09:15,917
where's her fucking stats? She is not holding
anything at all except for, let's say for dramatic

873
01:09:15,917 --> 01:09:23,031
effect, she has a tiny something in her hand that
looks like a charm bracelet or something that a

874
01:09:23,031 --> 01:09:30,101
young girl might have, like a hair tie with some
charms dangling from it or something. That's it.

875
01:09:30,101 --> 01:09:37,472
And she starts to move, right? That's what happens
with this thing, right? She comes towards you and

876
01:09:37,472 --> 01:09:45,767
her movement is <i>fast</i>. So she comes right over
and stops at your feet, looks up at you with puppy

877
01:09:45,767 --> 01:09:51,539
dog eyes as if to say: who are you and where are
we going? And that concludes her turn.

878
01:09:51,539 --> 01:09:54,654
LIAM: I barely notice because someone from the
Jersey Shore is lifting me into the air.

879
01:09:54,654 --> 01:10:01,336
SAM: That's the top of the round. Holy shit, I'm
running a game of Dungeons and Dragons!

880
01:10:01,336 --> 01:10:03,999
(cheering)

881
01:10:03,999 --> 01:10:06,227
ASHLY: You're doing a hell of a job!

882
01:10:06,227 --> 01:10:07,651
BRIAN: You're doing great.

883
01:10:07,651 --> 01:10:15,676
SAM: As the fight continues, time freezes. Our
vision dims. Flashes to another time, another

884
01:10:15,676 --> 01:10:21,754
place. It's blurry at first. Then, coming slowly
into focus is a dimly lit room, a simple table and

885
01:10:21,754 --> 01:10:26,971
chair in the center. From this perspective, only
the person in the chair can be seen. There is an

886
01:10:26,971 --> 01:10:32,540
off-stage voice: that of a gruff man, asking
questions, but we never see him. It is, by all

887
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:42,478
appearances, an interrogation. In the chair sits
Gryffin. The gruff voice says: "Uh-huh. And why

888
01:10:42,478 --> 01:10:45,870
"were you there? At the bar?"

889
01:10:45,870 --> 01:10:58,261
MARY: Well, I'd come to speak to Frankfurt.
Frankfurt had told me to meet him there because he

890
01:10:58,261 --> 01:11:04,095
was transporting someone that I needed to speak to
very badly--

891
01:11:04,095 --> 01:11:06,706
SAM: "This girl that you keep talking about,
right?"

892
01:11:06,706 --> 01:11:09,171
MARY: Yes, Holly, the girl. I needed to speak with
her.

893
01:11:09,171 --> 01:11:12,945
SAM: "Why? What could a little fucking girl have
that you needed?"

894
01:11:12,945 --> 01:11:16,143
MARY: I'm not supposed to be here!

895
01:11:16,143 --> 01:11:19,562
SAM: "Well, you're not going anywhere, honey."

896
01:11:19,562 --> 01:11:30,526
MARY: No, I mean, not here, in this chair. I mean
<i>here</i>! I come from Illyria, and the solar eclipse

897
01:11:30,526 --> 01:11:35,510
a week and a half ago placed us in this
wherever-the-hell we are, Jorell, I'm not sure

898
01:11:35,510 --> 01:11:41,696
where we are, right? And my city appears during
the solar eclipse, during the period of totality.

899
01:11:41,696 --> 01:11:53,622
So out I come. I was pushed out of my city, and I
woke up here. My city was gone. This girl, Holly,

900
01:11:53,622 --> 01:11:59,688
potentially could be from Illyria. I need to find
her so that I can find the location of where

901
01:11:59,688 --> 01:12:06,339
Illyria will reappear next. That's why I'm here! I
certainly didn't mean to start a fight with the

902
01:12:06,339 --> 01:12:09,496
cat, nor did I certainly mean to declaw her!

903
01:12:09,496 --> 01:12:15,373
SAM: "Are you some sort of royalty or something?
You talk real funny."

904
01:12:15,373 --> 01:12:20,724
MARY: Well. Yes, my mother was a queen and I was a
princess, yes.

905
01:12:20,724 --> 01:12:22,570
SAM: "Are you shitting me?"

906
01:12:22,570 --> 01:12:26,913
MARY: I have Prestidigitation. If you do shit
yourself I could clean you up?

907
01:12:26,913 --> 01:12:28,483
SAM: "Don't even think about it, honey."

908
01:12:28,483 --> 01:12:35,344
MARY: I never would. But yes, my queen, my
mother-- but she's no longer alive.

909
01:12:35,344 --> 01:12:45,572
SAM: Time shifts again. Same room, different time.
Now in the hot seat is Kingston, looking very

910
01:12:45,572 --> 01:12:59,566
confused. Eyes red, hungover, woozy, dazey. "So
this guy, he slept with your wife?"

911
01:12:59,566 --> 01:13:03,513
BRIAN: I mean, I'm pretty sure they fucked first.

912
01:13:03,513 --> 01:13:08,007
(laughter)

913
01:13:08,007 --> 01:13:11,936
SAM: "And that's all the beef there was between
you two?"

914
01:13:11,936 --> 01:13:16,809
BRIAN: That's all the beef there was in my house
that night, and there wasn't any beef in there for

915
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:18,743
a long time after.

916
01:13:18,743 --> 01:13:21,104
SAM: "What were you even doing in this bar?"

917
01:13:21,104 --> 01:13:27,441
BRIAN: I live above the bar. I have an extensive
tab.

918
01:13:27,441 --> 01:13:30,456
SAM: "But they let you live there?"

919
01:13:30,456 --> 01:13:40,485
BRIAN: I perform certain services in exchange for
drinks and board.

920
01:13:40,485 --> 01:13:47,190
SAM: "What does that mean? You sweep up after the
night is over?"

921
01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:53,584
BRIAN: If you mean I'm a male prostitute, then
yeah. I sweep up all of the elderly women at the

922
01:13:53,584 --> 01:14:00,246
end of the night. I take them upstairs, and I show
them a good time, and in exchange I get all the

923
01:14:00,246 --> 01:14:08,023
Greep and ale I want. Even the elderly of this
great land deserve to capture the flag every once

924
01:14:08,023 --> 01:14:09,512
in a while.

925
01:14:09,512 --> 01:14:12,565
MARY: (laughing) Why did you look at me?

926
01:14:12,565 --> 01:14:15,768
BRIAN: I was hoping you would tell me the rest of
what I was going to say.

927
01:14:15,768 --> 01:14:22,797
SAM: "So <i>you</i>, freaky-looking guy, are a male
prostitute?"

928
01:14:22,797 --> 01:14:33,076
BRIAN: Look, some of these elderly ladies, they
like their men with their make-up runny. But yes,

929
01:14:33,076 --> 01:14:38,564
in exchange for room and board, I will often
pleasure these women deep into the night.

930
01:14:38,564 --> 01:14:40,852
SAM: "I don't need the details, buddy."

931
01:14:40,852 --> 01:14:43,506
BRIAN: Oh, you haven't even scratched the surface
of the details.

932
01:14:43,506 --> 01:14:45,261
SAM: "Please, spare me."

933
01:14:45,261 --> 01:14:48,960
BRIAN: Okay. When the wigs come off--

934
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:56,185
SAM: Time shifts again. Now Clothesline, looking
surly and pissy, is in the hot seat.

935
01:14:56,185 --> 01:15:00,438
"What's with your face?"

936
01:15:00,438 --> 01:15:02,267
ASHLY: What's with yours, bastard?

937
01:15:02,267 --> 01:15:11,144
SAM: "Fair enough. The white-haired girl: what's
her deal? Did you know her?"

938
01:15:11,144 --> 01:15:12,613
ASHLY: Maybe.

939
01:15:12,613 --> 01:15:14,600
SAM: "Maybe what?"

940
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:16,848
ASHLY: What are you going to do if I don't answer
you?

941
01:15:16,848 --> 01:15:19,441
SAM: "Put you in jail."

942
01:15:19,441 --> 01:15:21,481
ASHLY: (growls) Yeah, I know her.

943
01:15:21,481 --> 01:15:23,163
SAM: "How?"

944
01:15:23,163 --> 01:15:29,253
ASHLY: She saved me once, all right? I was dying.
I don't know. I have almost died like 20 times, I

945
01:15:29,253 --> 01:15:35,681
don't keep track, okay? But this one time I was
almost going to <i>really die</i>, and she saved me.

946
01:15:35,681 --> 01:15:38,929
She helped me. Only person that's ever really done
that.

947
01:15:38,929 --> 01:15:41,761
SAM: "You would do anything for her?"

948
01:15:41,761 --> 01:15:48,120
ASHLY: Not anything. But I'd help her out, yeah.
Someone does you a good turn, you do it back.

949
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:50,346
SAM: "Were you helping her this night?"

950
01:15:50,346 --> 01:16:01,177
ASHLY: (sighs) She wanted me to make a
distraction. I don't know why, so don't ask. So I

951
01:16:01,177 --> 01:16:06,831
took a little skin off the creepy girl. There were
a couple creepy girls: the one with the weird eyes.

952
01:16:06,831 --> 01:16:11,152
SAM: "I just want to get this down: you are
admitting that you started the fight in the tavern?"

953
01:16:11,152 --> 01:16:12,969
ASHLY: Yeah.

954
01:16:12,969 --> 01:16:16,882
SAM: "All right. Thank you for your honesty."

955
01:16:16,882 --> 01:16:18,486
ASHLY: You're welcome.

956
01:16:18,486 --> 01:16:22,800
SAM: "Hey, where did you get that name, anyway?
Clothesline? Do you have another alias, anything else?"

957
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:30,117
ASHLY: Where I'm from, they give you a nickname
for the thing you like to do the most. I love to

958
01:16:30,117 --> 01:16:33,876
clothesline. There were a lot of "Porns" in the
town; it was kind of confusing.

959
01:16:33,876 --> 01:16:35,596
SAM: "A lot of 'Porns?'"

960
01:16:35,596 --> 01:16:39,455
ASHLY: Yeah. A lot of people's favorite thing is
porn. You talk to many people?

961
01:16:39,455 --> 01:16:44,098
SAM: "Yeah, no. That tracks. That definitely
tracks."

962
01:16:44,098 --> 01:16:45,957
LIAM: Etchings.

963
01:16:45,957 --> 01:16:53,801
MARY: Lots of etchings. Brass penis and balls with
wings pointing in certain directions.

964
01:16:53,801 --> 01:16:59,899
SAM: I don't know how to change music, people. I
don't know. Sorry about this. Time shifts again.

965
01:16:59,899 --> 01:17:08,802
Now in the hot seat we see Frankfurt, the dwarf.
"All right, this girl that you claim you were

966
01:17:08,802 --> 01:17:14,393
"there to deliver. Who gave her to you? Where did
you find her? Where did she come from?"

967
01:17:14,393 --> 01:17:23,439
ERIC: I was told I could have one courier pigeon.
I need to contact my lawyer. Why am I here?

968
01:17:23,439 --> 01:17:27,330
(laughter)

969
01:17:27,330 --> 01:17:29,527
SAM: "You'll get your courier pigeon."

970
01:17:29,527 --> 01:17:35,668
ERIC: Where's Obby? Obby! You've separated me from
my Obby.

971
01:17:35,668 --> 01:17:37,657
SAM: "Listen."

972
01:17:37,657 --> 01:17:38,615
ERIC: What?

973
01:17:38,615 --> 01:17:42,278
SAM: "We're trying to round up Obby right now.
We're aware of where he lives in town."

974
01:17:42,278 --> 01:17:43,789
ERIC: Where's the girl?

975
01:17:43,789 --> 01:17:45,711
SAM: "What do you mean, where's the girl?"

976
01:17:45,711 --> 01:17:51,154
ERIC: Where did you put the girl? I have one thing
to do and that's talk to Garello.

977
01:17:51,154 --> 01:17:55,167
SAM: "I will be asking the questions here, thank
you very much."

978
01:17:55,167 --> 01:17:56,590
ERIC: Ugh, I've never played.

979
01:17:56,590 --> 01:18:00,599
(laughter)

980
01:18:00,599 --> 01:18:07,783
SAM: "Fine. If you had your courier pigeon, who
would you send it to?"

981
01:18:07,783 --> 01:18:16,035
ERIC: I would send it to (coos, wings
fluttering).

982
01:18:16,035 --> 01:18:22,888
SAM: "While that is extremely impressive, it
leaves way more questions than answers."

983
01:18:22,888 --> 01:18:26,170
ERIC: What does a dwarf got to do to get some
Greep around here?

984
01:18:26,170 --> 01:18:29,352
SAM: "I don't feel like you're taking this
interrogation seriously."

985
01:18:29,352 --> 01:18:35,405
ERIC: I <i>am</i>. Okay, look. I was only told that I
had to transport this girl, Holly.

986
01:18:35,405 --> 01:18:37,694
SAM: "And what would you get in exchange?"

987
01:18:37,694 --> 01:18:41,687
ERIC: A couple bucks. 100 gold coins.

988
01:18:41,687 --> 01:18:43,261
SAM: "100 gold?!"

989
01:18:43,261 --> 01:18:44,568
ERIC: 100 of them, yes.

990
01:18:44,568 --> 01:18:46,705
SAM: "For just taking a girl from point A to point
B?"

991
01:18:46,705 --> 01:18:52,852
ERIC: Look, I do a lot of missions and I don't ask
many questions. I was told to bring her there, and

992
01:18:52,852 --> 01:19:02,371
I'm told to find the guy or a girl named Garello.
That's all I know. Hey, you seem to know a lot

993
01:19:02,371 --> 01:19:05,338
about me. Can I ask you something?

994
01:19:05,338 --> 01:19:06,898
SAM: "Go ahead."

995
01:19:06,898 --> 01:19:09,575
ERIC: What do you know about this Chained
Oblivion?

996
01:19:09,575 --> 01:19:15,788
SAM: "I know absolutely nothing about this Chained
Oblivion. It's some sort of fucking religious thing."

997
01:19:15,788 --> 01:19:19,120
ERIC: Well, I am going to take them down!

998
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:20,966
SAM: "Oh."

999
01:19:20,966 --> 01:19:23,171
ERIC: So if you see anyone from them.

1000
01:19:23,171 --> 01:19:27,792
SAM: "I don't see anyone from them. I've heard
rumors that they exist. Wait, why am I answering

1001
01:19:27,792 --> 01:19:42,500
"any questions?" Time shifts again. Now, we have a
white-haired girl child in the hot seat. "All

1002
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:46,845
"right, tell me your story. Why were you there?
What's a sweet, innocent little sweetheart like

1003
01:19:46,845 --> 01:19:49,843
"you doing in a place like The Ass Sailor?"

1004
01:19:49,843 --> 01:19:53,002
ASHLY: (laughing) I forgot it was called that.

1005
01:19:53,002 --> 01:19:59,986
LIAM: (soft giggling)

1006
01:19:59,986 --> 01:20:02,501
SAM: "Go on. I'm listening."

1007
01:20:02,501 --> 01:20:07,430
LIAM: Sorry. I was just imagining you burned to a
crisp.

1008
01:20:07,430 --> 01:20:09,827
SAM: "Excuse me?"

1009
01:20:09,827 --> 01:20:11,263
LIAM: Am I bound?

1010
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:14,522
SAM: Yeah, your hands are tied behind your back.

1011
01:20:14,522 --> 01:20:16,898
LIAM: Hands are tied behind my back. Are they
movable?

1012
01:20:16,898 --> 01:20:18,169
SAM: They're movable.

1013
01:20:18,169 --> 01:20:21,521
LIAM: They are? Then I cast Sacred Flame on the
guy.

1014
01:20:21,521 --> 01:20:26,214
SAM: I don't know what that is.

1015
01:20:26,214 --> 01:20:28,777
LIAM: Oh, it's holy fire for 1d8 damage.

1016
01:20:28,777 --> 01:20:30,182
SAM: Do you roll something?

1017
01:20:30,182 --> 01:20:35,344
LIAM: Yeah. The target must succeed on a dexterity
saving throw.

1018
01:20:35,344 --> 01:20:37,174
BRIAN: Talk about fuck the police.

1019
01:20:37,174 --> 01:20:39,365
LIAM: You make a dex save.

1020
01:20:39,365 --> 01:20:42,420
SAM: What was the number?

1021
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:45,902
LIAM: 14.

1022
01:20:45,902 --> 01:21:01,465
SAM: Okay. So as we see a burst of flame, right,
you said flames? We see from your eyes, they start

1023
01:21:01,465 --> 01:21:08,981
to glow and burn with a holy light and fire starts
to emanate from your eyes straight towards our

1024
01:21:08,981 --> 01:21:17,808
point of view. We hear a gruff man say: "Ugh. Hey!
What the fuck are you--" and time shifts again.

1025
01:21:17,808 --> 01:21:23,190
(laughter)

1026
01:21:23,190 --> 01:21:27,700
SAM: And we are back in the bar, and it's the top
of the round. Gryffin, it is your roll.

1027
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:34,137
MARY: I turn to Valerie and I pull out the bag of
gold that I was going to give Frankfurt and I say

1028
01:21:34,137 --> 01:21:38,100
to her: Valerie, I have no intention of doing you
any harm whatsoever. I'm so sorry to invade your

1029
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:44,218
space back here, but I <i>really</i> need to get out of
this place alive. I don't need your help. All I

1030
01:21:44,218 --> 01:21:51,401
need are four bottles of Greep. So here is a bag
of gold. May I have four bottles of Greep, please?

1031
01:21:51,401 --> 01:21:57,165
SAM: "There's a keg right there." It's right here.
It's full of Greep.

1032
01:21:57,165 --> 01:22:01,844
MARY: Okay. Is that something that I could
potentially carry?

1033
01:22:01,844 --> 01:22:05,722
SAM: It's heavy, but you can pick it up. It's a
pony keg.

1034
01:22:05,722 --> 01:22:08,642
MARY: Are there any bottles in my vicinity?

1035
01:22:08,642 --> 01:22:16,067
SAM: There are a bunch of cups over here. Greep is
a pour thing. So you either have a big bottle of

1036
01:22:16,067 --> 01:22:19,755
it or you can use your turn to start filling up
cups of it.

1037
01:22:19,755 --> 01:22:21,985
(laughter)

1038
01:22:21,985 --> 01:22:23,727
MARY: So there are no whiskey bottles or
anything?

1039
01:22:23,727 --> 01:22:26,599
SAM: There are whiskey bottles all over the place
in the back of the bar. They're not filled with

1040
01:22:26,599 --> 01:22:29,370
Greep, though; they've got different other
spirits: whiskey--

1041
01:22:29,370 --> 01:22:31,435
MARY: And there are no empty bottles whatsoever?

1042
01:22:31,435 --> 01:22:37,119
SAM: <i>Empty</i> bottles? Sure, yeah. They've taken
the used bottles and put them sort of behind the bar.

1043
01:22:37,119 --> 01:22:39,489
MARY: Great. I start filling bottles with Greep.

1044
01:22:39,489 --> 01:22:45,793
SAM: Bottles with Greep? You're going to use your
action to do this? All right. So Valerie, who

1045
01:22:45,793 --> 01:22:50,789
still doesn't really love you behind the bar is
watching you fill up bottles, but she's okay

1046
01:22:50,789 --> 01:22:55,623
because she got a bunch of gold out of it. So
she's allowing it with a sneer. The man right

1047
01:22:55,623 --> 01:23:03,093
behind you, Xavier, really doesn't like this, but
he is a ninny, so he's just like (grumbling).

1048
01:23:03,093 --> 01:23:05,881
MARY: For my bonus action, I toss him ten gold, as
well.

1049
01:23:05,881 --> 01:23:12,315
SAM: Oh, wow! Bonus action gold toss. That's nice.
While you're down there getting these bottles, why

1050
01:23:12,315 --> 01:23:16,464
don't you roll a perception check? (whispering) I
made these and I'm going to use them, fuckers!

1051
01:23:16,464 --> 01:23:25,980
MARY: I haven't used my Tides of Chaos this time.
Perception, though. 13.

1052
01:23:25,980 --> 01:23:33,149
SAM: 13. Yeah, sure. So you see a small box that
has intricate gold leafing around it. Looks out of

1053
01:23:33,149 --> 01:23:40,932
place behind there. It's small, the size of a deck
of cards or something. Oh god! You'll never see

1054
01:23:40,932 --> 01:23:56,080
it. Okay. That's a thing that exists. Okay, next
up. One, two, okay. This whore--

1055
01:23:56,080 --> 01:24:01,702
LIAM: Hey! You've known me for so long!

1056
01:24:01,702 --> 01:24:08,467
SAM: She wants to help out her hooker friend and
catch the old guy who's leaving, so she runs over

1057
01:24:08,467 --> 01:24:25,536
and attacks him. Yep, that hits. I'll roll for
damage. Great, where's he? Okay, so she lunges at

1058
01:24:25,536 --> 01:24:31,557
him and hits him in the back of the head and grabs
onto his pants, which pull them down. He's now

1059
01:24:31,557 --> 01:24:37,796
naked from the waist down. And slightly injured
and he says: "I'm being attacked! I'm being

1060
01:24:37,796 --> 01:24:46,426
"attacked!" Next. Remember, there is no three,
because I never assigned that number. Four. Okay.

1061
01:24:46,426 --> 01:24:52,606
The ranger has found her shit. This is the ranger
right here. She has found her bow and arrow,

1062
01:24:52,606 --> 01:24:58,719
nocked an arrow and she's going to shoot, she
needs some range, so she's going to shoot at the

1063
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:08,396
most prominent target in the room: the cat thing
on the bar, and she rolled a one. The arrow

1064
01:25:08,396 --> 01:25:15,314
whizzes by your head (arrow impact) right into the
thing behind you. No damage, no nothing. That's

1065
01:25:15,314 --> 01:25:23,431
four, five, next. Jayne, your turn. You are
currently restrained. I think you can do a

1066
01:25:23,431 --> 01:25:25,003
strength check to try to get out of it.

1067
01:25:25,003 --> 01:25:31,162
LIAM: I can attack normally, I just can't move
anywhere. I would like to do a melee spell attack

1068
01:25:31,162 --> 01:25:38,729
on him. So first I'm going to see if it hits then
I'll tell you what it is. That is an 18.

1069
01:25:38,729 --> 01:25:41,551
SAM: An 18? On whom?

1070
01:25:41,551 --> 01:25:43,313
LIAM: On the guy grappling me.

1071
01:25:43,313 --> 01:25:49,415
SAM: Oh yes, for sure. He was the Mutton Man,
right? His AC is 12. You hit.

1072
01:25:49,415 --> 01:25:54,505
LIAM: So I would like to cast Inflict Wounds at
level two and rot this fucking asshole from the

1073
01:25:54,505 --> 01:25:55,876
inside out.

1074
01:25:55,876 --> 01:25:59,096
SAM: Oh my god. I don't know what that is but it
sounds horrifying.

1075
01:25:59,096 --> 01:26:00,573
LIAM: Yeah, it is.

1076
01:26:00,573 --> 01:26:04,240
SAM: "Now, we're going to have some fun-- what the
fuck are you doing?"

1077
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:11,849
LIAM: 18. Good. That is a 25 total.

1078
01:26:11,849 --> 01:26:20,686
SAM: Okay, so with his snarling, disgusting yellow
teeth, he's smiling at you as his whole head from

1079
01:26:20,686 --> 01:26:27,982
top to bottom disintegrates into ash and falls to
the floor in a pile of disgustingness. He's dead

1080
01:26:27,982 --> 01:26:31,246
and gone. You are no longer restrained and can
move at will.

1081
01:26:31,246 --> 01:26:37,288
LIAM: I would like to use my bonus action to break
the fucking Lawbearer chain off my neck and throw

1082
01:26:37,288 --> 01:26:39,447
it over my shoulder and walk towards the door.

1083
01:26:39,447 --> 01:26:41,315
BRIAN: Yeah, fuck that thing!

1084
01:26:41,315 --> 01:26:48,802
SAM: Okay. No longer restrained. You're calmly
walking out like you own the place. No one takes a

1085
01:26:48,802 --> 01:26:55,715
strike against you because you're not involved in
combat with them. Oh, this guy is gone! Splash

1086
01:26:55,715 --> 01:27:05,572
one. Okay, that ends your turn. Let's see.
(counting) So after Frankfurt, Holly goes. Okay,

1087
01:27:05,572 --> 01:27:17,397
that's you, Jayne. Next is the guard who failed on
his attack against you, tabaxi, the last time. So

1088
01:27:17,397 --> 01:27:25,312
instead, he's frustrated by that, so he will
attack again. Why not? He rolls a natural 20 with

1089
01:27:25,312 --> 01:27:37,682
his longsword. d8. This is not going to be good
for you. Eight. So 16 points of damage as you take

1090
01:27:37,682 --> 01:27:47,487
a sword right in your left shin. Your leg buckles.
You fall to one knee and blood starts pouring out

1091
01:27:47,487 --> 01:27:55,877
of your furry knee. And he says, "I've got you
that time!" That's his turn. We go to Clothesline,

1092
01:27:55,877 --> 01:27:57,103
it's your turn.

1093
01:27:57,103 --> 01:28:05,525
ASHLY: You fucking asshole! What's the worst that
I can do to him on sword, please? I'm going to

1094
01:28:05,525 --> 01:28:06,984
slash at him with my longsword.

1095
01:28:06,984 --> 01:28:08,627
SAM: Sure, go for it.

1096
01:28:08,627 --> 01:28:11,095
ASHLY: So that is a ten.

1097
01:28:11,095 --> 01:28:20,382
SAM: Ooh. Because your knee is buckled, you're
wobbly. Your sword strike goes errant and strikes

1098
01:28:20,382 --> 01:28:26,512
the side of the bar, digging into it. He looks up
at you and laughs again. This is an epic battle

1099
01:28:26,512 --> 01:28:29,300
between a very lowly guard and you.

1100
01:28:29,300 --> 01:28:34,717
ASHLY: Can I still do a bonus action?

1101
01:28:34,717 --> 01:28:41,232
SAM: Oh, yeah, you do have a bonus action! You
have, I believe, an action surge if you wanted to

1102
01:28:41,232 --> 01:28:42,498
attack again.

1103
01:28:42,498 --> 01:28:47,617
LIAM: You could get an extra one-time attack right
now.

1104
01:28:47,617 --> 01:28:50,297
SAM: You can just attack again. I gave her two
because I like her.

1105
01:28:50,297 --> 01:28:57,786
ASHLY: I'm going to try to do the same thing:
attack with my longsword. Okay. 14?

1106
01:28:57,786 --> 01:29:00,165
SAM: That hits. He has AC 13.

1107
01:29:00,219 --> 01:29:08,227
ASHLY: 1d8. Is this a d8? I'm so bad at this.
This, right? Okay. Eight.

1108
01:29:08,227 --> 01:29:16,724
SAM: Okay. Yeah, he's dead. Your sword digs into
his neck, getting about halfway in. He looks

1109
01:29:16,724 --> 01:29:21,821
surprised and he falls over, limp on the ground.
He's gone and dead.

1110
01:29:21,821 --> 01:29:23,958
LIAM: I'll never learn the violin!

1111
01:29:23,958 --> 01:29:26,248
SAM: End of him.

1112
01:29:26,248 --> 01:29:28,594
BRIAN: You're getting hotter as this night goes
on.

1113
01:29:28,594 --> 01:29:32,499
SAM: Jesus. Frankfurt, you are up.

1114
01:29:32,499 --> 01:29:37,376
ERIC: How can I get in contact with Gryffin? Is
she gone?

1115
01:29:37,376 --> 01:29:38,786
SAM: In contact with her?

1116
01:29:38,786 --> 01:29:41,245
MARY: I'm fucking filling up bottles with Greep.

1117
01:29:41,245 --> 01:29:43,953
SAM: Yeah, she's behind the bar. You can yell at
her.

1118
01:29:43,953 --> 01:29:45,658
ERIC: Hey!

1119
01:29:45,658 --> 01:29:48,206
MARY: Frankfurt!

1120
01:29:48,206 --> 01:29:56,021
ERIC: Yes. Apparently, I have a thing for a
fine-looking noble blondes. That'd be you.

1121
01:29:56,021 --> 01:29:58,917
SAM: You're flirting during this fight?

1122
01:29:58,917 --> 01:30:00,608
ERIC: Yeah.

1123
01:30:00,608 --> 01:30:03,028
MARY: Thirsty?

1124
01:30:03,028 --> 01:30:05,296
ERIC: Yes. Greep, please.

1125
01:30:05,296 --> 01:30:18,662
SAM: People are running around half-naked. Somehow
all the sound dims. They make eye contact. It's

1126
01:30:18,662 --> 01:30:19,876
beautiful.

1127
01:30:19,876 --> 01:30:22,117
ERIC: I've been looking all over for you.

1128
01:30:22,117 --> 01:30:23,278
MARY: I've been looking for you, too.

1129
01:30:23,278 --> 01:30:24,989
ERIC: I have Holly.

1130
01:30:24,989 --> 01:30:26,406
MARY: I know. I need her.

1131
01:30:26,406 --> 01:30:27,251
ERIC: Okay.

1132
01:30:27,251 --> 01:30:30,679
SAM: As you talk, Holly is walking towards the
door.

1133
01:30:30,679 --> 01:30:32,701
MARY: She's walking away from you.

1134
01:30:32,701 --> 01:30:36,137
ERIC: How can I stop Holly?

1135
01:30:36,137 --> 01:30:40,071
SAM: You can move. You can attack. You can grab.
You can do all sorts of things.

1136
01:30:40,071 --> 01:30:43,663
ERIC: What has her possessed to move away?

1137
01:30:43,663 --> 01:30:48,855
SAM: You don't know. All you saw was she stood up,
walked away from the table, and started walking

1138
01:30:48,855 --> 01:30:59,438
towards the door. She paused briefly to look up at
Jayne, this white-haired person. Jayne kept

1139
01:30:59,438 --> 01:31:06,549
walking to the door, and Holly's eyes followed
followed Jayne. It looks like she's watching

1140
01:31:06,549 --> 01:31:09,462
Jayne's every move with rapt attention.

1141
01:31:09,462 --> 01:31:11,436
LIAM: I am rather attractive.

1142
01:31:11,436 --> 01:31:13,868
ERIC: Well, I got to do something about Jayne,
then.

1143
01:31:13,868 --> 01:31:15,093
MARY: Get Holly.

1144
01:31:15,093 --> 01:31:16,352
ERIC: I will get Holly.

1145
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:23,059
SAM: You're right here, and I forget your
movement, but you can at least move to Holly. 25.

1146
01:31:23,059 --> 01:31:31,979
You can get to Holly if you'd like to. Okay, you
jump over this dog, you get to Holly. A courier

1147
01:31:31,979 --> 01:31:33,643
pigeon flies by.

1148
01:31:33,643 --> 01:31:40,605
ERIC: I got shit in my eye! Fucking pigeon! How is
there a pigeon inside of a tavern?

1149
01:31:40,605 --> 01:31:48,349
SAM: You can grab her. You can attack someone. You
can do whatever you would like to do.

1150
01:31:48,349 --> 01:31:50,528
ERIC: Well, I will secure her. I will grab her.

1151
01:31:50,528 --> 01:31:53,172
SAM: Okay, so roll a strength check.

1152
01:31:53,172 --> 01:31:58,524
BRIAN: Roll a d20, Eric, and add your strength
modifier.

1153
01:31:58,524 --> 01:32:02,720
ERIC: Okay, d20? Ten.

1154
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:18,428
SAM: Okay. What's your strength modifier? It's
four, for you, so 14. So she's going to roll. She

1155
01:32:18,428 --> 01:32:21,598
rolls an eight plus zero. She is grappled!

1156
01:32:21,598 --> 01:32:26,520
ERIC: You're not going anywhere! I've got a job to
do.

1157
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:33,733
SAM: Still, her eyes seem distant, and pupils
dilated, but she is unable to move any further.

1158
01:32:33,733 --> 01:32:35,622
BRIAN: Put the ring around her, Sam. You brought
it all the way here.

1159
01:32:35,622 --> 01:32:46,366
SAM: I got multiple rings! Holly's not moving. You
have a bonus action if you want to use it. You

1160
01:32:46,366 --> 01:32:57,287
have bonus actions if you'd like. I don't know
what spells you've chosen, but you do have a few

1161
01:32:57,287 --> 01:33:01,517
spells that you can use as a bonus action. Or you
can do nothing, yell to Obby.

1162
01:33:01,517 --> 01:33:05,035
LIAM: Oh! Command only lasts one round.

1163
01:33:05,035 --> 01:33:10,570
SAM: Well, it hasn't come back to Holly yet.

1164
01:33:10,570 --> 01:33:13,925
LIAM: Well, I'm letting you know, that it's not
going to last forever.

1165
01:33:13,925 --> 01:33:15,196
SAM: That's good to know.

1166
01:33:15,196 --> 01:33:19,762
BRIAN: That's bringing her towards you?

1167
01:33:19,762 --> 01:33:21,095
LIAM: At the moment.

1168
01:33:21,095 --> 01:33:23,374
SAM: It was your "and I walk away" that did it.

1169
01:33:23,374 --> 01:33:25,768
ERIC: Can I Smite anyone?

1170
01:33:25,768 --> 01:33:28,698
MARY: Does he have any more movement?

1171
01:33:28,698 --> 01:33:34,440
SAM: It took most of his movement to get over
there. It's a cramped bar; he's dodging dogs and

1172
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:37,406
stuff. Smite, I don't know how it works. Liam, how
does Smite work?

1173
01:33:37,406 --> 01:33:41,955
LIAM: He attacks. If he hits, he does regular
damage and adds Smite damage.

1174
01:33:41,955 --> 01:33:46,225
SAM: Oh, but this is Divine Smite you're talking
about. That is after a melee hit. We're looking at

1175
01:33:46,225 --> 01:33:49,461
a bonus action. He's used his action to grapple
Holly.

1176
01:33:49,461 --> 01:33:51,868
LIAM: Right, so he can't attack.

1177
01:33:51,868 --> 01:33:54,875
SAM: He can't attack. If you have a bonus action
spell?

1178
01:33:54,875 --> 01:34:00,384
LIAM: He could cast Hunter's Mark. Did you cast
that already? You could cast Hunter's Mark on

1179
01:34:00,384 --> 01:34:02,334
Jayne, or anybody.

1180
01:34:02,334 --> 01:34:07,542
SAM: Or you don't have to do anything. You can
hold your spells for later, whatever you want to do.

1181
01:34:07,542 --> 01:34:09,212
ERIC: I'm happy with grappling.

1182
01:34:09,212 --> 01:34:11,578
SAM: Okay, good. I love your voice.

1183
01:34:11,578 --> 01:34:16,623
ERIC: What voice? I'm just being myself.

1184
01:34:16,623 --> 01:34:21,726
SAM: The old man who was trying to flee, he's
going to attack one of the whores. He does not hit.

1185
01:34:21,726 --> 01:34:23,908
MARY: Whores are tough.

1186
01:34:23,908 --> 01:34:27,924
BRIAN: You leave those whores alone.

1187
01:34:27,924 --> 01:34:33,238
SAM: It is Holly's turn. She is restrained. She
doesn't know what the fuck's going on. She's still

1188
01:34:33,238 --> 01:34:38,302
under her spell. I guess the spell is fading off
now. So she shakes it off, doesn't know how she

1189
01:34:38,302 --> 01:34:43,678
got over here. Now she's being held by a strong
dwarf man. She doesn't do anything to fight that.

1190
01:34:43,678 --> 01:34:50,410
Kingston? It's your turn.

1191
01:34:50,410 --> 01:34:54,376
BRIAN: Am I still over by that table over there?

1192
01:34:54,376 --> 01:34:56,292
SAM: You are still over by the table.

1193
01:34:56,292 --> 01:35:00,127
BRIAN: And where is Frankfurt, at the moment?

1194
01:35:00,127 --> 01:35:03,197
SAM: Frankfurt's closer to the door. He's this guy
in gold right here.

1195
01:35:03,197 --> 01:35:06,165
BRIAN: Okay, cool. I'm going to cast Hold Person
on Frankfurt.

1196
01:35:06,165 --> 01:35:12,999
SAM: Oh, shit. Wait, you're going to hold a guy
who's holding a girl. This is amazing. Okay,

1197
01:35:12,999 --> 01:35:28,909
Kingston, your spell DC is 14. Hold Person, I
believe, is wisdom? So roll a d20 and add your

1198
01:35:28,909 --> 01:35:34,848
wisdom save modifier. It's in a little box that
Liam will point to you right now.

1199
01:35:34,848 --> 01:35:41,958
LIAM: Wisdom save is this, so plus three. Natural
20!

1200
01:35:41,958 --> 01:35:46,421
SAM: Spells are not working tonight.

1201
01:35:46,421 --> 01:35:50,623
LIAM: Actually: thanks, Keyleth. Because those are
her dice.

1202
01:35:50,623 --> 01:35:56,616
SAM: Kingston has been drinking a lot tonight, so
all of his spells when uttered come out a little

1203
01:35:56,616 --> 01:36:04,531
bit slurry. And they don't seem to have as much
power. Again, there's a little prickling in the

1204
01:36:04,531 --> 01:36:08,499
back of your neck but nothing happens. Kingston's
very frustrated. You have a bonus action and

1205
01:36:08,499 --> 01:36:10,489
movement if you'd like it, Kingston.

1206
01:36:10,489 --> 01:36:24,871
BRIAN: I'm going to move over where I was by the
bar at the beginning. At the end of the bar.

1207
01:36:24,871 --> 01:36:30,995
SAM: I think you can move, what, 30 feet? No one's
engaging you, so you walk over and you get all the

1208
01:36:30,995 --> 01:36:32,257
way there.

1209
01:36:32,257 --> 01:36:40,499
BRIAN: Then that's probably good. I don't know
what to do for a bonus action.

1210
01:36:40,499 --> 01:36:45,477
SAM: You don't have to do anything. You can
inspire. You can heal.

1211
01:36:45,477 --> 01:36:48,074
BRIAN: I can't use a cantrip for a bonus action,
can I?

1212
01:36:48,074 --> 01:36:54,403
SAM: I let Mary do it. Yeah, go for it, because
your spells have been sucking tonight.

1213
01:36:54,403 --> 01:36:58,830
BRIAN: I was going to do Vicious Mockery on
Frankfurt.

1214
01:36:58,830 --> 01:37:02,631
SAM: Okay, before you move, while you're still in
range of him, because I think it's 30 feet--

1215
01:37:02,631 --> 01:37:04,289
BRIAN: 60.

1216
01:37:04,289 --> 01:37:08,995
SAM: 60? Then by the bar, you got to yell loud
because you're across this loud bar.

1217
01:37:08,995 --> 01:37:17,482
BRIAN: (singing) I'm so excited! And I just can't
hide it! I know, I know, I know, I know I'm going

1218
01:37:17,482 --> 01:37:19,238
to kill you!

1219
01:37:19,238 --> 01:37:28,956
SAM: The sung words from Kingston's somewhat-drunk
voice enter your ear and affect you in a way that

1220
01:37:28,956 --> 01:37:36,551
you've never felt before. You feel bad about
yourself. You feel demeaned, and you feel unsure

1221
01:37:36,551 --> 01:37:42,142
of yourself as a dwarf in general. You take actual
physical damage.

1222
01:37:42,142 --> 01:37:46,675
BRIAN: It's 1d4 psychic damage, and you have
disadvantage on the next attack roll you make

1223
01:37:46,675 --> 01:37:48,706
before the end of your turn.

1224
01:37:48,706 --> 01:37:52,272
SAM: So roll a d4 and add something.

1225
01:37:52,272 --> 01:37:55,350
BRIAN: Do I add my spell--

1226
01:37:55,350 --> 01:37:58,483
SAM: No, just a d4. This is a damage roll we're
doing.

1227
01:37:58,483 --> 01:37:59,664
BRIAN: That's a four.

1228
01:37:59,664 --> 01:38:05,019
SAM: Four plus what does it say on the spell? 1d4
plus something?

1229
01:38:05,019 --> 01:38:09,555
BRIAN: Psychic damage. Yeah, 1d4 psychic damage
and you take disadvantage on the next attack roll.

1230
01:38:09,555 --> 01:38:17,209
SAM: So you take four points of damage, so you are
less powerful than you were before, and you can't

1231
01:38:17,209 --> 01:38:22,268
get the song out of your head, and it will affect
your next turn. You will have to do your next turn

1232
01:38:22,268 --> 01:38:26,620
at disadvantage, which means you will be thrown
off. So take your little number there and reduce

1233
01:38:26,620 --> 01:38:28,545
it by some points.

1234
01:38:28,545 --> 01:38:29,844
ERIC: So 34, right?

1235
01:38:29,844 --> 01:38:38,231
SAM: Yep, sure. Okay, that is Kingston. The
half-orc is going to run over to Kingston and hit

1236
01:38:38,231 --> 01:38:48,508
him. He heard your dulcet tones. He doesn't like
them. It is an unarmed strike. He does not hit

1237
01:38:48,508 --> 01:38:56,417
you. He whiffs. The sound confuses him, and he's
too tall for you, anyway. Just goes right over

1238
01:38:56,417 --> 01:38:57,828
your head clean.

1239
01:38:57,828 --> 01:38:59,314
LIAM: "I have auditory issues."

1240
01:38:59,314 --> 01:39:05,008
SAM: That's the top of the round. What do I do
next?

1241
01:39:05,008 --> 01:39:09,538
BRIAN: This is fun, Sam. Even though the spells
aren't working.

1242
01:39:09,538 --> 01:39:13,151
MARY: There's no magic working at all tonight.

1243
01:39:13,151 --> 01:39:16,349
BRIAN: You guys can't see, but behind Sam, his
hair is starting to fall out.

1244
01:39:16,349 --> 01:39:28,649
SAM: The heat of the room and the movement of
everyone around is really making the place fucking

1245
01:39:28,649 --> 01:39:37,583
hot. So hot, in fact, that you all get the sense
that if you don't remove an article of clothing

1246
01:39:37,583 --> 01:39:45,809
soon, you may become exhausted. So there's a brief
pause in the action where everyone says, "Oh my

1247
01:39:45,809 --> 01:39:52,547
"god. It's fucking hot in here!" I would need you
all to either remove an article of clothing or suffer

1248
01:39:52,547 --> 01:39:54,537
one point of exhaustion.

1249
01:39:54,537 --> 01:39:57,637
LIAM: Oh man, the room has turned into (singing)
turn down for what!

1250
01:39:57,637 --> 01:40:01,782
ASHLY: I'm going to rip everything clean off.

1251
01:40:01,782 --> 01:40:07,489
SAM: Everything? Well, you're a furry. You've got
nothing on. So you're ripping your fur off?

1252
01:40:07,489 --> 01:40:09,212
ASHLY: Wait, I don't have anything on?

1253
01:40:09,212 --> 01:40:14,281
SAM: Where's your picture? Okay, you have armor.
You want to take off your armor? You're going to

1254
01:40:14,281 --> 01:40:15,880
lose AC.

1255
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:19,808
ASHLY: Can I take off just the pants? Can I go
Donald Duck?

1256
01:40:19,808 --> 01:40:31,362
SAM: Sure. I'm going to give you a negative one to
AC. So you're down to 18. And we can see your cat

1257
01:40:31,362 --> 01:40:32,675
lady bits.

1258
01:40:32,675 --> 01:40:34,081
ASHLY: Are they articulated?

1259
01:40:34,081 --> 01:40:35,998
SAM: Yeah, they're nice.

1260
01:40:35,998 --> 01:40:41,123
BRIAN: They are some of the best in the land.

1261
01:40:41,123 --> 01:40:44,422
MARY: #CriticalRoleFanart.

1262
01:40:44,422 --> 01:40:47,548
SAM: Kingston, anything?

1263
01:40:47,548 --> 01:40:50,307
BRIAN: I'll take the point of exhaustion.

1264
01:40:50,307 --> 01:40:53,916
SAM: Oh shit! So you have disadvantage--

1265
01:40:53,916 --> 01:40:56,210
BRIAN: Wait, I thought it was minus one point.

1266
01:40:56,210 --> 01:41:00,133
SAM: No, I think exhaustion is disadvantage on all
ability checks.

1267
01:41:00,133 --> 01:41:07,872
BRIAN: Well, fuck that! I'll take off my corset.
What am I wearing? I'll take off my Spanx.

1268
01:41:07,872 --> 01:41:11,803
SAM: You're going to take off your shirt, so you
are now shirtless.

1269
01:41:11,803 --> 01:41:18,652
BRIAN: Yeah, behold! This is what happens when you
give up!

1270
01:41:18,652 --> 01:41:26,770
SAM: He rips open his shirt. The buttons fly
everywhere exposing a really out of shape guy.

1271
01:41:26,770 --> 01:41:30,732
Little man boobies, love handles.

1272
01:41:30,732 --> 01:41:32,618
BRIAN: So I'm Dan Harmon, basically.

1273
01:41:32,618 --> 01:41:39,401
SAM: Yeah, really lopsided, too. It's not good. A
writer's body. Gryffin, anything

1274
01:41:39,401 --> 01:41:40,871
you'd like to remove?

1275
01:41:40,871 --> 01:41:50,611
MARY: I'm ripping off my sleeves. I've got this
white gown underneath the light studded armor. I

1276
01:41:50,611 --> 01:41:53,759
rip off some sleeves.

1277
01:41:53,759 --> 01:41:58,990
SAM: All right, so you're sleeveless now. This is
strange for you, because it's an elegant gown. You

1278
01:41:58,990 --> 01:42:04,691
rip off the sleeves and it's frayed and tattered
there. You feel a little uncomfortable. Jayne?

1279
01:42:04,691 --> 01:42:12,790
LIAM: Yeah, I rip off the cloak that I'm wearing
to reveal the white porcelain doll dress and

1280
01:42:12,790 --> 01:42:19,583
straps of white leather around the biceps and
around the thighs. Yeah, I look like Courtney Love

1281
01:42:19,583 --> 01:42:21,147
a little bit.

1282
01:42:21,147 --> 01:42:25,057
SAM: Anything else we should know about that we
see?

1283
01:42:25,057 --> 01:42:32,313
LIAM: There are very light chain tattoos along the
collarbones, disappearing down the dress.

1284
01:42:32,313 --> 01:42:35,676
SAM: You look so good. Frankfurt, what you got?

1285
01:42:35,676 --> 01:42:40,605
ERIC: My chainmail shirt.

1286
01:42:40,605 --> 01:42:42,127
SAM: You're going to take it off?

1287
01:42:42,127 --> 01:42:43,288
LIAM: Wow.

1288
01:42:43,288 --> 01:42:45,007
ERIC: Wait.

1289
01:42:45,007 --> 01:42:53,824
BRIAN: That's how DND works. You take off the
stuff that's really heavy and metallic.

1290
01:42:53,824 --> 01:42:55,580
ERIC: What if I shaved?

1291
01:42:55,580 --> 01:42:59,023
SAM: You cannot shave.

1292
01:42:59,023 --> 01:43:05,869
ERIC: It looks like I've got a--

1293
01:43:05,869 --> 01:43:12,237
SAM: Some sort of a tunic thing. Your options are
pants or armor, we'll say.

1294
01:43:12,237 --> 01:43:16,831
ASHLY and MARY: (chanting) Pants! Pants!

1295
01:43:16,831 --> 01:43:17,954
ERIC: Pants!

1296
01:43:17,954 --> 01:43:19,812
(laughter)

1297
01:43:19,812 --> 01:43:21,166
ASHLY: You and me, Frankfurt!

1298
01:43:21,166 --> 01:43:23,155
ERIC: I'm going to go with pants.

1299
01:43:23,155 --> 01:43:32,197
SAM: Seeing Frankfurt's exposed wang drives
Kingston into a fit of rage. He knows that was the

1300
01:43:32,197 --> 01:43:40,519
wang that was in his wife. And he wants to hit
that wang so hard. I don't know what's going on.

1301
01:43:40,519 --> 01:43:48,213
BRIAN: Put those pants back on, you foul creature,
before I come over there and do no more damage to you!

1302
01:43:48,213 --> 01:43:55,309
SAM: Obby the Rat, who has been saving his turn
for a while now and forgotten about, does not like

1303
01:43:55,309 --> 01:44:01,782
where this is going. And so he strikes out at the
first person he can get to. What's his movement?

1304
01:44:01,782 --> 01:44:06,486
Not very much. Shoot, he can't get to anybody.

1305
01:44:06,486 --> 01:44:09,128
LIAM: "I kick the dog."

1306
01:44:09,128 --> 01:44:15,251
SAM: Sure, he's going to kick the dog. No, why
would he kick a dog? He's going to attack

1307
01:44:15,251 --> 01:44:16,617
someone who's in a fight.

1308
01:44:16,617 --> 01:44:20,856
ASHLY: What about the old guy and the lady
prostitutes?

1309
01:44:20,856 --> 01:44:28,938
SAM: Yeah, he's got to get there, though. He's
going to push past the prostitute and defend Holly

1310
01:44:28,938 --> 01:44:37,114
and hit the first person he can, which is this
woman right here, this fighter. 15. Oh yeah, he

1311
01:44:37,114 --> 01:44:38,635
takes her.

1312
01:44:38,635 --> 01:44:41,355
BRIAN: Just a quick question. No one has attacked
the prostitutes yet, right?

1313
01:44:41,355 --> 01:44:48,876
SAM: The old man has tried, but I think he failed.
Okay, she's gone, he knocks her out. She's dead.

1314
01:44:48,876 --> 01:44:54,067
All right, top of the round? Oh my god, this is so
hard.

1315
01:44:54,067 --> 01:44:57,155
LIAM: How does Matt do it, right? Every week.

1316
01:44:57,155 --> 01:45:00,207
SAM: Okay. Gryffin, what would you like to do?

1317
01:45:00,207 --> 01:45:10,307
MARY: So I take my sleeves, and I rip off a piece
and shove one into a bottle. Are there any candles

1318
01:45:10,307 --> 01:45:12,134
lit near me?

1319
01:45:12,134 --> 01:45:16,456
SAM: There are candles lit near you. There are
torches on the wall and a couple candles on the

1320
01:45:16,456 --> 01:45:17,718
bar for light.

1321
01:45:17,718 --> 01:45:24,435
MARY: So I light one of the bottles of Greep on
fire, and I throw it at the kitty-kitty-kitty.

1322
01:45:24,435 --> 01:45:28,845
SAM: She's right next to you. You wouldn't have to
throw it far, you would just smash it on the bar.

1323
01:45:28,845 --> 01:45:32,612
MARY: Smash it on the bar. Is that considered
movement at that point?

1324
01:45:32,612 --> 01:45:36,702
SAM: I would say that you would want to move back
a little bit so you don't get splashed or hit.

1325
01:45:36,702 --> 01:45:39,536
MARY: Well, I'd like to throw it at her and then
run.

1326
01:45:39,536 --> 01:45:55,323
SAM: It's an area of effect, so I'm going to treat
this as like a very modified Fireball. What's your

1327
01:45:55,323 --> 01:46:03,614
spell attack bonus? It's plus six. So roll a d20,
add six.

1328
01:46:03,614 --> 01:46:07,173
ASHLY: I really want to do the Terminator thing
where I walk through the fire.

1329
01:46:07,173 --> 01:46:13,775
MARY: 16. I'd like to use my Tides of Chaos again
but I can't.

1330
01:46:13,775 --> 01:46:25,688
SAM: Oh, you have advantage! No, you used that the
last time. Let's see here, this would be a dex

1331
01:46:25,688 --> 01:46:29,072
save. Do a dex save, catty.

1332
01:46:29,072 --> 01:46:31,159
ASHLY: 18.

1333
01:46:31,159 --> 01:46:38,078
SAM: So you still get burned, but you take half
damage. Let's see, it's a modified thing, so I'm

1334
01:46:38,078 --> 01:46:48,682
going to roll. That's cocked. So take five points
of fire damage as the fire spreads across the bar.

1335
01:46:48,682 --> 01:46:58,104
Let's say that it's green fire, because I have a
rubber band. That guy gets hit, too. He takes one

1336
01:46:58,104 --> 01:47:00,929
point of damage. Kingston, you take--

1337
01:47:00,929 --> 01:47:02,491
BRIAN: Wait, I'm at the other end.

1338
01:47:02,491 --> 01:47:04,268
SAM: I thought you were here?

1339
01:47:04,268 --> 01:47:11,298
BRIAN: At the start of the game I was at that end
of the bar. That's okay. I might still get hit,

1340
01:47:11,298 --> 01:47:13,741
but that's fine. I just wanted to be on that
corner.

1341
01:47:13,741 --> 01:47:17,431
LIAM: You created a combat scenario for yourself
with 33 enemies.

1342
01:47:17,431 --> 01:47:24,479
SAM: I don't know what the fuck I was thinking.
Okay, good. The bar's on fire. People are running

1343
01:47:24,479 --> 01:47:32,898
away from it, "I don't know who I am! I don't have
a fully fleshed-out character!" This cat is on

1344
01:47:32,898 --> 01:47:42,251
fire, makes your heart weep. And your fur is on
fire, as well. This is bad. That was great.

1345
01:47:42,251 --> 01:47:43,980
Anything bonus, anything other?

1346
01:47:43,980 --> 01:47:50,540
MARY: No. I'd love to reset that Tides of Chaos. I
have to roll on the table.

1347
01:47:50,540 --> 01:47:53,057
SAM: You have to cast a spell for that, right?

1348
01:47:53,057 --> 01:47:55,952
MARY: Once I do Tides of Chaos, you can do it--

1349
01:47:55,952 --> 01:48:02,959
SAM: No, I mean you have to cast something to roll
on the table. Spells don't just come out of you,

1350
01:48:02,959 --> 01:48:12,564
you have to try to cast a spell, right? I don't
know how your fucking wild sorcery works.

1351
01:48:12,564 --> 01:48:16,074
MARY: So was that my action, to drop all of that?

1352
01:48:16,074 --> 01:48:19,307
SAM: Yes, but if you have a bonus action or
something you can use?

1353
01:48:19,307 --> 01:48:34,312
MARY: Yes, I would like to bonus action a
Firebolt at kitty-kitty-kitty.

1354
01:48:34,312 --> 01:48:39,769
SAM: Oh my god, fire is the thing today. So you
automatically roll on the table. So get out your

1355
01:48:39,769 --> 01:48:45,707
100-sided die. This young lady is a wild sorcerer,
she--

1356
01:48:45,707 --> 01:48:49,254
MARY: (New Jersey accent) Hey, don't fucking tell
me what the fuck I am, motherfucker! All right?

1357
01:48:49,254 --> 01:48:53,407
Hold on a second! How you people doing? You good?
Look at you, little girl with your white hair.

1358
01:48:53,407 --> 01:48:58,631
Where the fuck did that come from? Ooh,
kitty-kitty-kitty, fucking pussy. How you doing?

1359
01:48:58,631 --> 01:49:03,371
You and I need to talk later, apparently, from
what I hear. I'm not sure. You got man boobs;

1360
01:49:03,371 --> 01:49:08,612
that's kind of hot. Okay, what did I roll? I
rolled an 80-fucking-six. How you doing? Hold on,

1361
01:49:08,612 --> 01:49:10,416
just wait!

1362
01:49:10,416 --> 01:49:17,752
SAM: She starts acting very strangely, talking in
a different accent. Her whole personality shifts

1363
01:49:17,752 --> 01:49:20,651
and magic seems to overtake her body.

1364
01:49:20,651 --> 01:49:24,683
MARY: (New Jersey accent) What the
bing-ba-da-bing-bo-boom? This is bad. I can feel

1365
01:49:24,683 --> 01:49:29,273
it, oh! Oh! Ba-da-bing!

1366
01:49:29,273 --> 01:49:35,607
SAM: The Diceman over there feels a sudden pain
inside her belly as part of her magic has

1367
01:49:35,607 --> 01:49:44,723
disappeared. She tried to cast a Firebolt spell on
you, but instead of any fire coming out of her,

1368
01:49:44,723 --> 01:49:52,140
nothing happens. Instead she feels slightly less
magical than she was a moment ago. She has lost

1369
01:49:52,140 --> 01:49:54,578
her highest spell slot.

1370
01:49:54,578 --> 01:50:00,400
MARY: (New Jersey accent) I got maybe one left. I
don't know. I love you people! I'll talk to you

1371
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:05,675
soon. Go to the Clam Broth House. They need
service over there. Ba-da-bing, love you, Jersey!

1372
01:50:05,675 --> 01:50:07,334
That's my name, too!

1373
01:50:07,334 --> 01:50:10,665
LIAM: (New Jersey accent) Did you just make a
Hoboken reference in the middle of our DND game?

1374
01:50:10,665 --> 01:50:13,016
MARY: (New Jersey accent) It don't exist no more,
bitches.

1375
01:50:13,016 --> 01:50:18,572
LIAM: (New Jersey accent) The Clam Broth House is
a huge part of my childhood, and she's right. It's

1376
01:50:18,572 --> 01:50:20,851
not there any more. It's been gentrified.

1377
01:50:20,851 --> 01:50:24,910
MARY: (New Jersey accent) Every fucking Mother's
Day we used to go to the-- Father's Day.

1378
01:50:24,910 --> 01:50:27,833
BRIAN: Now it's a Momofuku or whatever it was.

1379
01:50:27,833 --> 01:50:31,323
LIAM: (New Jersey accent) Sure, yeah. When I was a
kid, it was a place where drunks stumbled out of.

1380
01:50:31,323 --> 01:50:34,404
MARY: (New Jersey accent) It was a place where
freaking Sinatra used to go.

1381
01:50:34,404 --> 01:50:38,436
SAM: The guy the no pants, the old man is dead.
One of the whores just killed him with a

1382
01:50:38,436 --> 01:50:39,952
crossbow.

1383
01:50:39,952 --> 01:50:42,058
BRIAN: What was her name? Was it Kay?

1384
01:50:42,058 --> 01:50:43,519
SAM: That was Kay.

1385
01:50:43,519 --> 01:50:48,620
BRIAN: Good job, Kay. You get extra applesauce.

1386
01:50:48,620 --> 01:50:56,309
SAM: We go to four. This other ranger now sees
that the dwarves are on the move. She shoots a

1387
01:50:56,309 --> 01:51:02,151
shot at you, Frankfurt. What's your AC?

1388
01:51:02,151 --> 01:51:05,798
LIAM: It is 15.

1389
01:51:05,798 --> 01:51:13,401
SAM: She does not hit you. A crossbow bolt whizzes
by your body and hits this person behind you.

1390
01:51:13,401 --> 01:51:20,405
"Hey, I wasn't even doing anything!" Let's see
here. Jayne, you're up.

1391
01:51:20,405 --> 01:51:31,021
LIAM: Oh, am I? There's still a dwarf holding the
girl, right? The dwarf is holding her?

1392
01:51:31,021 --> 01:51:34,577
SAM: The dwarf? No, Frankfurt is still holding
her. She is grappled.

1393
01:51:34,577 --> 01:51:35,921
LIAM: Frankfurt is?

1394
01:51:35,921 --> 01:51:38,302
SAM: Yeah, Obby is standing in front of her in a
defensive position.

1395
01:51:38,302 --> 01:51:42,668
LIAM: I would like to hit that fucking dwarf's
bare ass with my whip, so I'm going to make an

1396
01:51:42,668 --> 01:51:46,180
attack. Oh, that's a natural one!

1397
01:51:46,180 --> 01:51:48,215
(groaning)

1398
01:51:48,215 --> 01:51:56,147
SAM: The whip crack knocks a bowl of Greep off the
table. It explodes! There is fire on the floor

1399
01:51:56,147 --> 01:52:02,206
over there. Right there. She's on fire. "I
literally haven't done anything!"

1400
01:52:02,206 --> 01:52:12,267
LIAM: Fucking fuck a duck. As a bonus action, I
would like to cast Sanctuary on myself.

1401
01:52:12,267 --> 01:52:17,539
SAM: Okay. An invisible shield comes up around
Jayne, who is still right next to the door, unless

1402
01:52:17,539 --> 01:52:18,859
you want to move.

1403
01:52:18,859 --> 01:52:23,419
LIAM: No, I have to stay right here. Next.

1404
01:52:23,419 --> 01:52:33,750
SAM: Okay. Val, the human bartender, will pick up
her greataxe from behind the bar, and she wants

1405
01:52:33,750 --> 01:52:42,710
you off the bar. She's going to swing. She's
trying to protect her bar. Ten. What's your AC?

1406
01:52:42,710 --> 01:52:44,430
ASHLY: An 18.

1407
01:52:44,430 --> 01:52:50,707
SAM: You're fine. The fire confuses her. She
swings wide. Clothesline, you're up.

1408
01:52:50,707 --> 01:52:53,400
ASHLY: I'm going to fucking pounce on this
motherfucker. Okay.

1409
01:52:53,400 --> 01:52:54,653
SAM: On the bartender?

1410
01:52:54,653 --> 01:53:01,691
ASHLY: No, on this one. This cat's claws thing.
What is that? What's the deal with that? Climbing

1411
01:53:01,691 --> 01:53:03,046
speed of 20?

1412
01:53:03,046 --> 01:53:07,531
SAM: Oh, you can climb very well and fast. That's
all. You can also slash with them.

1413
01:53:07,531 --> 01:53:16,381
ASHLY: As part of my movement toward her, could I
slash during my movement? Like a pounce?

1414
01:53:16,381 --> 01:53:19,213
SAM: You mean to get two strikes out of it?

1415
01:53:19,213 --> 01:53:20,496
ASHLY: Yeah.

1416
01:53:20,496 --> 01:53:29,643
SAM: I would say that upon reaching her, you could
make a slash attack, but you'd have to get to her

1417
01:53:29,643 --> 01:53:32,817
and then past her to even touch her.

1418
01:53:32,817 --> 01:53:35,637
ASHLY: Okay, I'm just going to move toward her,
then. Hop off the bar.

1419
01:53:35,637 --> 01:53:38,257
SAM: Okay. So you jump off the bar. You're no
longer on fire or in the fire. You get right next

1420
01:53:38,257 --> 01:53:39,527
to her.

1421
01:53:39,527 --> 01:53:42,571
ASHLY: And I'm going to clothesline her.

1422
01:53:42,571 --> 01:53:44,795
SAM: Sure. That's what you do.

1423
01:53:44,795 --> 01:53:47,996
MARY: You're so repetitive!

1424
01:53:47,996 --> 01:53:52,743
ASHLY: Hey Gryffin, are you freshly laundered
clothing? Because you're about to get

1425
01:53:52,743 --> 01:53:54,009
clotheslined!

1426
01:53:54,009 --> 01:53:56,199
(laughter)

1427
01:53:56,199 --> 01:53:57,779
ASHLY: That's a 21.

1428
01:53:57,779 --> 01:53:59,176
SAM: Oh, that'll hit.

1429
01:53:59,176 --> 01:54:06,539
BRIAN: Hey, guys, we do not guarantee that all the
Critical Role dice roll this well. Because before

1430
01:54:06,539 --> 01:54:08,570
you buy them, she's rolled three 20s on it.

1431
01:54:08,570 --> 01:54:16,383
ASHLY: Five. And then she is knocked prone,
right?

1432
01:54:16,383 --> 01:54:20,193
SAM: Oh wait, if you rolled a four, she is knocked
prone.

1433
01:54:20,193 --> 01:54:22,447
MARY: Can I react to any of this?

1434
01:54:22,447 --> 01:54:26,273
SAM: Sure. Do you have a reaction? Is that a thing
that you have?

1435
01:54:26,273 --> 01:54:28,412
LIAM: There's no reaction to getting hit in the
face.

1436
01:54:28,412 --> 01:54:35,128
SAM: No, unless by your class, can cast a reaction
spell, but I don't think you can, so you're okay.

1437
01:54:35,128 --> 01:54:45,025
ASHLY: Okay, so I do four damage. No, five damage
because I rolled a one. And then, for a bonus

1438
01:54:45,025 --> 01:54:51,543
action, oh! I should probably heal. Second wind.
Regains 1d10 plus four HP.

1439
01:54:51,543 --> 01:54:54,348
SAM: Oh, nice. Roll that d10.

1440
01:54:54,348 --> 01:54:56,644
BRIAN: Roll that beautiful bean footage.

1441
01:54:56,644 --> 01:55:05,437
SAM: After she clotheslines you, we see the tabaxi
take a deep breath of air and now, out of the

1442
01:55:05,437 --> 01:55:08,964
fire, suddenly she feels better than ever before.

1443
01:55:08,964 --> 01:55:12,555
ASHLY: It says clothesline attack takes ten feet
of movement. Could I have moved away?

1444
01:55:12,555 --> 01:55:15,266
SAM: How fast is your movement total?

1445
01:55:15,266 --> 01:55:16,289
ASHLY: 30.

1446
01:55:16,289 --> 01:55:19,983
SAM: So it took you 20 feet to get there. You have
another ten feet if you'd like to go somewhere else.

1447
01:55:19,983 --> 01:55:27,234
ASHLY: Okay. I'll move toward Jayne and Frankfurt,
that whole situation.

1448
01:55:27,234 --> 01:55:30,054
SAM: Okay, go this way. Excuse me, pardon me,
excuse me.

1449
01:55:30,054 --> 01:55:31,866
MARY: Do I get an attack of--

1450
01:55:31,866 --> 01:55:35,946
SAM: No, because I think it was a part of her-- I
think that's how it works. She does not get an

1451
01:55:35,946 --> 01:55:37,606
attack of opportunity, right?

1452
01:55:37,606 --> 01:55:39,303
LIAM: It's if somebody is running away from you.

1453
01:55:39,303 --> 01:55:44,013
SAM: Yeah, but this is during the move, right?
You ran by, clotheslined her, and keep running. So

1454
01:55:44,013 --> 01:55:45,883
I don't think you get an attack of opportunity.

1455
01:55:45,883 --> 01:55:47,282
LIAM: That's hazy; that's up to you.

1456
01:55:47,282 --> 01:55:55,101
SAM: I'm going to say no. Because I got to keep it
moving; there's more shit to do! Who's next? That

1457
01:55:55,101 --> 01:55:58,089
was Jayne, Clothesline. Frankfurt, you're up.

1458
01:55:58,089 --> 01:55:59,247
ERIC: Yes.

1459
01:55:59,247 --> 01:56:01,644
SAM: What would you like to do, Frankie?

1460
01:56:01,644 --> 01:56:06,037
ERIC: Is it possible to move Holly?

1461
01:56:06,037 --> 01:56:09,003
SAM: Yeah, you're holding her. You can do whatever
you want.

1462
01:56:09,003 --> 01:56:11,796
ERIC: I want to pull her towards Gryffin.

1463
01:56:11,796 --> 01:56:16,260
SAM: Okay. Gryffin's way across the room. Sure.
What's your movement?

1464
01:56:16,260 --> 01:56:17,832
ERIC: 25.

1465
01:56:17,832 --> 01:56:28,848
SAM: She is not resisting. I'll say that you get
full halfway there, right around where kitty-cat

1466
01:56:28,848 --> 01:56:35,175
is. That's your movement. You can still act. Can
still do something, or you could have attacked

1467
01:56:35,175 --> 01:56:37,408
before you moved. Up to you.

1468
01:56:37,408 --> 01:56:42,881
ERIC: I just need to talk to Gryffin. That's the
point.

1469
01:56:42,881 --> 01:56:44,425
SAM: Just talking!

1470
01:56:44,425 --> 01:56:45,742
ERIC: How you doing?

1471
01:56:45,742 --> 01:56:47,139
MARY: I've been better!

1472
01:56:47,139 --> 01:56:51,203
ERIC: I'd like to heal her. Is that a
possibility?

1473
01:56:51,203 --> 01:56:57,262
SAM: Sure, yeah! Do you have a healing spell of some
sort or a potion of some sort?

1474
01:56:57,262 --> 01:57:00,714
ERIC: I believe so.

1475
01:57:00,714 --> 01:57:08,327
SAM: Lay on Hands. You can use Lay on Hands. You
have a healing pool of 20 hit points you can give

1476
01:57:08,327 --> 01:57:14,731
in any denomination to anyone. So you can give her
20, you can give her one, you can give her four.

1477
01:57:14,731 --> 01:57:16,581
You can do whatever you want.

1478
01:57:16,581 --> 01:57:19,929
ERIC: What's it going to take to make you feel
better? We can strike a deal. Ten.

1479
01:57:19,929 --> 01:57:28,969
SAM: So from your 20, you now have ten left in
your reserve. Gryffin heals ten. If you want to do

1480
01:57:28,969 --> 01:57:31,540
a bonus action, or anything else?

1481
01:57:31,540 --> 01:57:34,787
LIAM: Hunter's Mark or nothing.

1482
01:57:34,787 --> 01:57:36,143
ERIC: Nothing.

1483
01:57:36,143 --> 01:57:44,373
SAM: Good. That's Frankfurt. Who's left? Holly's
not going to do anything. That guy is dead. We're

1484
01:57:44,373 --> 01:57:46,491
going to go to Kingston.

1485
01:57:46,491 --> 01:57:56,754
BRIAN: I am going to move closer to the action.
Can you put me on your left side of that table

1486
01:57:56,754 --> 01:58:01,250
with the weird onion garlic clove looking nutsack
on it? Is that a candle?

1487
01:58:01,250 --> 01:58:02,707
SAM: Yes.

1488
01:58:02,707 --> 01:58:09,845
BRIAN: Put me there, bro. Then I'm going to cast
Sleep onto Frankfurt.

1489
01:58:09,845 --> 01:58:20,391
SAM: Shit. You guys are turning really mean. Go
for it. Sleep is not a ranged attack; it's a spell

1490
01:58:20,391 --> 01:58:24,917
save DC of 14 against what save?

1491
01:58:24,917 --> 01:58:30,325
BRIAN: Can I target one person with it, or does it
get everybody? I've never used this spell.

1492
01:58:30,325 --> 01:58:33,805
SAM: Learn your spells! I can look it up.

1493
01:58:33,805 --> 01:58:39,835
BRIAN: Roll 5d8. The total is how many points of
creatures this spell can affect. Does that mean I

1494
01:58:39,835 --> 01:58:41,613
get everybody with that?

1495
01:58:41,613 --> 01:58:44,385
SAM: Roll 5d8 first.

1496
01:58:44,385 --> 01:58:53,521
BRIAN: All eights. Just kidding.

1497
01:58:53,521 --> 01:59:00,535
SAM: Oh, there's no save on Sleep. It just
happens.

1498
01:59:00,535 --> 01:59:02,593
LIAM: You count it up.

1499
01:59:02,593 --> 01:59:04,018
BRIAN: 25.

1500
01:59:04,018 --> 01:59:08,105
SAM: 25. Okay. I don't how this works because
you've got more than 25 hit points.

1501
01:59:08,105 --> 01:59:12,791
LIAM: The one with the lowest hit points gets hit
first within the area of effect.

1502
01:59:12,791 --> 01:59:14,354
MARY: How many does Holly have?

1503
01:59:14,354 --> 01:59:18,766
SAM: The lowest hit points?

1504
01:59:18,766 --> 01:59:22,280
LIAM: Creatures within 20 feet of a point you
choose within range. Did you pick a point?

1505
01:59:22,280 --> 01:59:23,981
SAM: He picked Frankfurt.

1506
01:59:23,981 --> 01:59:28,165
LIAM: Are affected in ascending order of their
current hit points, starting with the creature

1507
01:59:28,165 --> 01:59:32,933
that has the lowest current hit points. Each
creature affected by this spell falls unconscious

1508
01:59:32,933 --> 01:59:35,255
until the spell ends.

1509
01:59:35,255 --> 01:59:37,551
BRIAN: Fuck, Sam, this one's complicated.

1510
01:59:37,551 --> 01:59:39,362
MARY: How many does Holly have?

1511
01:59:39,362 --> 01:59:41,126
SAM: More than that, and so does Frankfurt.

1512
01:59:41,126 --> 01:59:45,947
LIAM: So whoever's at their lowest gets hit first.
Hit the dog with one hit point.

1513
01:59:45,947 --> 01:59:48,046
SAM: Yeah, so the dog's asleep.

1514
01:59:48,046 --> 01:59:50,038
LIAM: That's the first hit point.

1515
01:59:50,038 --> 01:59:53,245
SAM: Tabaxi, how many hit points do you have?
She's okay.

1516
01:59:53,245 --> 01:59:56,927
MARY: What about Zarvah?

1517
01:59:56,927 --> 02:00:00,451
BRIAN: I don't want to hit tabaxi, I want to hit
Dr. Frankfurt!

1518
02:00:00,451 --> 02:00:04,104
LIAM: Frankfurt's in the center. Viking woman.
Barmaid?

1519
02:00:04,104 --> 02:00:15,425
SAM: Yeah, so she's down. She's asleep on fire.
Barmaid's asleep, for sure. And then there's not

1520
02:00:15,425 --> 02:00:28,192
enough hit points left for him. You make all these
randoms fall asleep. This guy, too. Four people

1521
02:00:28,192 --> 02:00:32,257
pass out around Frankfurt. They are peacefully
asleep.

1522
02:00:32,257 --> 02:00:47,910
BRIAN: All right, so then for my bonus non-action,
can I inspire my beautiful cat friend with a

1523
02:00:47,910 --> 02:00:49,338
bardic inspiration?

1524
02:00:49,338 --> 02:00:50,563
SAM: Of course you can.

1525
02:00:50,563 --> 02:00:52,425
ASHLY: This relationship is so confusing!

1526
02:00:52,425 --> 02:01:03,481
BRIAN: Not to me. I'm going to cast this on you,
and you can add 1d6 to an attack, save. Okay.

1527
02:01:03,481 --> 02:01:14,869
(sings) Pour me some Greep, boys, and fuck my tab.
I want to go home with this sexy cat, and maybe Jayne.

1528
02:01:14,869 --> 02:01:17,898
ASHLY: (singing) Jayne's a minor.

1529
02:01:17,898 --> 02:01:21,178
MARY: (singing) Those rules don't apply in this
world.

1530
02:01:21,178 --> 02:01:26,512
LIAM: She's not a minor, but she is not
interested.

1531
02:01:26,512 --> 02:01:30,259
BRIAN: Yet. Wait until I put my shirt back on.

1532
02:01:30,259 --> 02:01:35,110
SAM: That's an inspiration to you. Hearing his
words of compliment inspires you. What is your

1533
02:01:35,110 --> 02:01:36,678
inspiration die?

1534
02:01:36,678 --> 02:01:40,711
BRIAN: You know what, man? As a bard, tell me
where that is.

1535
02:01:40,711 --> 02:01:43,373
(laughter)

1536
02:01:43,373 --> 02:01:52,535
SAM: We'll look it up. I don't remember. It's your
charisma modifier. It's probably a d8. I'm going

1537
02:01:52,535 --> 02:01:56,561
to say a d8, because I don't know, man. You get
one extra d8 on your next roll.

1538
02:01:56,561 --> 02:02:01,500
BRIAN: Oh, wait, no. It says here that it's a d6.
Yeah, cast this on another creature. That player

1539
02:02:01,500 --> 02:02:03,743
can add 1d6 to an attack, save, or skill check.

1540
02:02:03,743 --> 02:02:06,752
LIAM: Players are in charge of knowing their shit,
except for Eric.

1541
02:02:06,752 --> 02:02:21,371
SAM: Okay! Suddenly, without warning, without
making a sound, a new mysterious figure emerges

1542
02:02:21,427 --> 02:02:31,045
from the back room. Pushing Xavier away, he moves
quickly and silently across the Ass Sailor with a

1543
02:02:31,045 --> 02:02:36,587
speed none of you have ever witnessed. It's like
the figure runs without moving his body. He floats

1544
02:02:36,587 --> 02:02:46,299
in a beautiful sprint. As he passes by you,
Gryffin, you suddenly feel even hotter than

1545
02:02:46,299 --> 02:02:52,603
before. For an instant, he strikes fear into your
heart. Roll a perception check.

1546
02:02:52,603 --> 02:03:04,518
MARY: (gasps) Perception. That would be a 20.

1547
02:03:04,518 --> 02:03:14,955
SAM: Oh fuck. Okay. I could whisper, but that
takes too much time. You see first, as he glides

1548
02:03:14,955 --> 02:03:22,251
past you, he is wearing pants. He looks like a
normal human man except his eyes are different.

1549
02:03:22,251 --> 02:03:32,338
They seem to glow red. It's disconcerting. Also,
as you watch him run, his gait is weird. There's

1550
02:03:32,338 --> 02:03:39,766
no this movement of his shoulder, it's just
straight like he's floating, like he has no legs.

1551
02:03:39,766 --> 02:03:49,511
And as he whizzes by you, past these sleeping
people, you see the faintest flick of a tail. He

1552
02:03:49,511 --> 02:03:57,274
runs across. Does not say a word. Does not make an
attack towards you, Frankfurt. Does not even

1553
02:03:57,274 --> 02:04:03,333
regard you. But simply removes Holly from your
grasp. Roll a strength save.

1554
02:04:03,333 --> 02:04:05,634
ERIC: With which dice?

1555
02:04:05,634 --> 02:04:09,283
SAM: d20 plus your strength. Ability check.

1556
02:04:09,283 --> 02:04:13,769
ERIC: Is that Garello? Excuse me!

1557
02:04:13,769 --> 02:04:19,795
LIAM: You don't know. That's the mystery, Eric.
Plus five, that's right. 23!

1558
02:04:19,795 --> 02:04:25,686
SAM: 23? Let me look. Oh, wait. Didn't you have
some sort of disadvantage?

1559
02:04:25,686 --> 02:04:30,901
MARY: No, he tried to cast Sleep on him, but it
didn't work.

1560
02:04:30,901 --> 02:04:37,346
BRIAN: No, he got Vicious Mockery. Which means he
has disadvantage on his next attack roll.

1561
02:04:37,346 --> 02:04:44,143
SAM: We're going to put it on this. Roll again. It
was a while ago; we never did it. We're doing it here.

1562
02:04:44,143 --> 02:04:46,524
BRIAN: That wasn't his last turn.

1563
02:04:46,524 --> 02:04:49,043
SAM: No, I know, but we haven't incorporated it.

1564
02:04:49,043 --> 02:04:50,791
LIAM: So why are we doing it again?

1565
02:04:50,791 --> 02:04:52,539
SAM: Did he roll with disadvantage on his last
turn?

1566
02:04:52,539 --> 02:04:57,275
BRIAN: I did it after his last turn because I roll
after him in the initiative.

1567
02:04:57,275 --> 02:05:01,467
LIAM: Jesus, it was almost the same! Oh no, that's
a 12. 17.

1568
02:05:01,467 --> 02:05:12,794
SAM: 17. Where's the Guide? Shit. 17. Nope, that's
not it. Shit, too many pages! All right, I'm going

1569
02:05:12,794 --> 02:05:19,537
to just make something up. I'm going to say that
there's a brief tug-of-war. He does wrest Holly

1570
02:05:19,537 --> 02:05:27,508
from your grasp, but you slow him down
considerably and he only gets five more feet away

1571
02:05:27,508 --> 02:05:29,411
from you. He's going this way.

1572
02:05:29,411 --> 02:05:32,450
BRIAN: He's taking Holly with him.

1573
02:05:32,450 --> 02:05:35,447
SAM: He's taking Holly with him, and he's making a
beeline this way.

1574
02:05:35,447 --> 02:05:39,245
BRIAN: What's that way? The door's that way.

1575
02:05:39,245 --> 02:05:47,879
SAM: I don't know. You don't know. Gryffin, you
saw this weird thing just happen. What are you

1576
02:05:47,879 --> 02:05:49,380
going to do?

1577
02:05:49,380 --> 02:05:51,303
MARY: Are we back up to the top of the round?

1578
02:05:51,303 --> 02:05:52,909
SAM: Why not? Sure.

1579
02:05:52,909 --> 02:06:04,657
MARY: All right. Oh my god. I rush over to
Frankfurt.

1580
02:06:04,657 --> 02:06:08,308
SAM: You rush over to Frankfurt? Sure. What are
you doing?

1581
02:06:08,308 --> 02:06:10,480
MARY: What the fuck is going on?

1582
02:06:10,480 --> 02:06:11,861
ERIC: I don't know.

1583
02:06:11,861 --> 02:06:13,047
MARY: Where's the girl?

1584
02:06:13,047 --> 02:06:14,092
ERIC: Who was that guy?

1585
02:06:14,092 --> 02:06:15,982
MARY: I don't know. There was a tail. He had some
sort of tail.

1586
02:06:15,982 --> 02:06:17,161
ERIC: Where are my pants?

1587
02:06:17,161 --> 02:06:22,104
MARY: Well, it got really hot in here. And you're
fine. Do you still have the hotdog buns? Because

1588
02:06:22,104 --> 02:06:27,498
that could help keep you-- Are you all right? No?
Okay, don't worry about it. Who's the girl? Tell

1589
02:06:27,498 --> 02:06:28,826
me about her.

1590
02:06:28,826 --> 02:06:32,955
ERIC: Look, I don't know. Her name is Holly. She
lost her mother.

1591
02:06:32,955 --> 02:06:35,303
MARY: Is she from Illyria?

1592
02:06:35,303 --> 02:06:40,031
SAM: I love how they are having conversations
through this whole fight. I love it!

1593
02:06:40,031 --> 02:06:48,589
MARY: That's all right, we're just going. How can
I help you? Is he prone, is he anything-- Is he all right?

1594
02:06:48,589 --> 02:06:52,971
SAM: No, he's fine. Nothing happened.

1595
02:06:52,971 --> 02:06:55,833
LIAM: This has got to be Gilmore Girls dialogue.

1596
02:06:55,833 --> 02:06:59,212
SAM: He is naked from the waist down.

1597
02:06:59,212 --> 02:07:02,307
ASHLY: He's feeling ashamed.

1598
02:07:02,307 --> 02:07:05,894
MARY: I don't know what to do.

1599
02:07:05,894 --> 02:07:12,085
SAM: Did you move over to Frankfurt? You see this
dude carrying a girl running across the room.

1600
02:07:12,085 --> 02:07:29,409
MARY: All right. So I am going-- viciously mocked.
Okay! I am going to cast a cantrip of Ray of Frost

1601
02:07:29,409 --> 02:07:36,668
on him. It's a ranged attack against a target.

1602
02:07:36,668 --> 02:07:40,008
SAM: Roll a d20 and add six.

1603
02:07:40,008 --> 02:07:43,288
MARY: 16.

1604
02:07:43,288 --> 02:07:46,343
SAM: That hits. Go ahead.

1605
02:07:46,343 --> 02:07:55,531
MARY: He gets 1d8 cold damage and his speed is
reduced by ten feet until the start of my next turn.

1606
02:07:55,531 --> 02:07:57,473
SAM: That's very useful.

1607
02:07:57,473 --> 02:08:12,416
MARY: Yes, so 1d6. Six! 1d8, motherfucker. Five!
Five damage, and he's reduced to ten feet.

1608
02:08:12,416 --> 02:08:19,641
SAM: The cold blast hits him in the back squarely,
and even though it's a minor spell, you see him

1609
02:08:19,641 --> 02:08:29,370
react way worse than you thought it would be. He
cries out with an inhuman shriek (shrieks) and

1610
02:08:29,370 --> 02:08:39,897
seems to take even more damage than that. But he
continues on, slowly now. Because his non-feet

1611
02:08:39,897 --> 02:08:51,377
feel slower. All right, go on. He is where he is.
That is Gryffin's turn. Next is-- I don't care

1612
02:08:51,377 --> 02:09:00,805
about them. Jayne. Oh, sorry. There is a ranger
who's going to shoot somebody. I don't care. I'm

1613
02:09:00,805 --> 02:09:13,477
rolling to see who she fires at, and I rolled
Jayne. Sorry, I rolled randomly. It's a plus-five,

1614
02:09:13,477 --> 02:09:15,481
so that's eight plus five, 13.

1615
02:09:15,481 --> 02:09:21,754
LIAM: I am 13, but until the spell ends, any
creature who targets the warded creature must make

1616
02:09:21,754 --> 02:09:26,750
a wisdom save versus 14.

1617
02:09:26,750 --> 02:09:31,584
SAM: Okay, versus 14. She fails that. She goes to
draw her bow on you.

1618
02:09:31,584 --> 02:09:34,976
LIAM: Choose a new target or lose the attack.

1619
02:09:34,976 --> 02:09:42,728
SAM: She chooses a new target. She chooses
Clothesline. She fires, and it's a one. She's so

1620
02:09:42,728 --> 02:09:47,592
discombobulated that she hasn't hit anything
today. She sucks. Okay, now it's Jayne.

1621
02:09:47,592 --> 02:09:55,340
LIAM: Okay, so I know that I can get within ten
feet. I'm going to take my fucking white whip and

1622
02:09:55,340 --> 02:09:57,162
whip this guy in the fucking face.

1623
02:09:57,162 --> 02:09:59,718
BRIAN: Violence is Jayne's addiction.

1624
02:09:59,718 --> 02:10:06,664
LIAM: Ugh, no. It's bullshit. It's eight. It's
just an eight. That does not hit.

1625
02:10:06,664 --> 02:10:10,987
SAM: The whip makes a wonderful crack, and nothing
else happens.

1626
02:10:10,987 --> 02:10:23,680
LIAM: Fuck it! Then, for a bonus action, I'm going
to cast Chill Touch on both whoever this person is

1627
02:10:23,680 --> 02:10:30,495
and Clothesline because I'm a death cleric and
part of my perks is that I can cast Chill Touch on

1628
02:10:30,495 --> 02:10:38,164
two people next to each other instead of just one.
Two ghostly spectral hands fly out and latch onto

1629
02:10:38,164 --> 02:10:48,346
both of their fucking faces. The targets must both
succeed on a dexterity saving throw versus 14.

1630
02:10:48,346 --> 02:10:50,582
ASHLY: 14.

1631
02:10:50,582 --> 02:10:52,096
LIAM: Fuck you, Ashly Burch!

1632
02:10:52,096 --> 02:10:54,523
ASHLY: Fuck you! You betrayed me, you piece of
shit!

1633
02:10:54,523 --> 02:10:56,235
SAM: You did it on the bad guy?

1634
02:10:56,235 --> 02:10:57,254
LIAM: Yeah, both of them.

1635
02:10:57,254 --> 02:10:58,197
SAM: 17.

1636
02:10:58,197 --> 02:10:59,522
LIAM: Oh, then neither worked.

1637
02:10:59,522 --> 02:11:04,240
ASHLY: Do I notice that this motherfucker did that
to me, though?

1638
02:11:04,240 --> 02:11:10,073
SAM: Yeah, you see a blue spectral hand reach out
towards your face. It's super freaky. There's

1639
02:11:10,073 --> 02:11:15,114
fingernails on it, and then it suddenly (gasp)
faces away. It's super weird, and it emerges from

1640
02:11:15,114 --> 02:11:22,694
Jayne. While she cast the spell, it seems that her
lips go to the back a little bit, then become

1641
02:11:22,694 --> 02:11:29,285
thinner. Her eyes narrow, and she has this
skeleton look for half a second as she casts the

1642
02:11:29,285 --> 02:11:31,554
spell and then goes back to normal.

1643
02:11:31,554 --> 02:11:33,614
LIAM: Oh, BFFs K-I-T!

1644
02:11:33,614 --> 02:11:37,049
BRIAN: I'm terrified.

1645
02:11:37,049 --> 02:11:42,399
SAM: Okay, that's Jayne. Next is-- oh, you've got
more?

1646
02:11:42,399 --> 02:11:46,343
LIAM: Well, I can move back one space. That's it.

1647
02:11:46,343 --> 02:11:48,895
SAM: Clothesline, what you got? Clothesline, what
you got?

1648
02:11:48,895 --> 02:11:59,035
ASHLY: Hey, idiots. You want this little girl?
Talking to you. I'm talking to you. I'll help you.

1649
02:11:59,035 --> 02:12:07,734
Fuck you, Jayne! I'm going to attack Jayne.

1650
02:12:07,734 --> 02:12:09,779
SAM: Okay, go.

1651
02:12:09,779 --> 02:12:11,904
LIAM: Sanctuary is still up.

1652
02:12:11,904 --> 02:12:14,241
ASHLY: What does that mean?

1653
02:12:14,241 --> 02:12:15,974
LIAM: I don't know. You don't know.

1654
02:12:15,974 --> 02:12:18,386
SAM: Just do your attack first.

1655
02:12:18,386 --> 02:12:28,879
ASHLY: Okay. I'm going to use my longsword, even
though I'm tempted to clothesline you. So that's 18.

1656
02:12:28,879 --> 02:12:38,013
SAM: Okay, first make a wisdom saving throw, yeah.
So roll your d20. Add wisdom save.

1657
02:12:38,013 --> 02:12:39,968
ASHLY: Seven.

1658
02:12:39,968 --> 02:12:45,429
SAM: That's not great. So you feel the urge to
maybe hit somebody else.

1659
02:12:45,429 --> 02:12:47,333
ASHLY: I'll hit the guy taking Holly.

1660
02:12:47,333 --> 02:12:49,523
SAM: Okay, go for it. Roll again for your attack.

1661
02:12:49,523 --> 02:12:53,377
ASHLY: That's a 14.

1662
02:12:53,377 --> 02:12:59,781
SAM: Again, you are so distracted by what just
happened that your sword knocks over a bottle of

1663
02:12:59,781 --> 02:13:03,911
Greep, which explodes, and this dude's now on
fire.

1664
02:13:03,911 --> 02:13:06,091
ASHLY: Okay, as long as I'm not.

1665
02:13:06,091 --> 02:13:13,505
SAM: "I don't have a name!" Okay, that's
Clothesline. Frankfurt, you're next.

1666
02:13:13,505 --> 02:13:20,349
ERIC: I would like to attack the guy that's taking
Holly.

1667
02:13:20,349 --> 02:13:25,784
SAM: So you're going to move towards him? All
right. With the speed of a Frankfurt, you move

1668
02:13:25,784 --> 02:13:28,436
towards him, and you do something.

1669
02:13:28,436 --> 02:13:32,583
ERIC: A pantsless Frankfurt. I would like to hit
him with the maul.

1670
02:13:32,583 --> 02:13:33,969
SAM: Go for it.

1671
02:13:33,969 --> 02:13:35,685
ERIC: 20-sided die?

1672
02:13:35,685 --> 02:13:37,069
SAM: Yes, please.

1673
02:13:37,069 --> 02:13:38,884
ERIC: 18.

1674
02:13:38,884 --> 02:13:43,824
SAM: That hits. Go ahead and roll for damage. Your
maul does 2d6 plus six.

1675
02:13:43,824 --> 02:13:53,877
LIAM: Yep, the square. The cube. Six! Plus. Roll
it again. Six!

1676
02:13:53,877 --> 02:13:58,443
SAM: 18 points of damage. Oh shit.

1677
02:13:58,443 --> 02:14:01,489
ERIC: Take that.

1678
02:14:01,489 --> 02:14:12,771
SAM: Whoa. My god. The man with the girl is super
surprised. Oh wait. Even though you hit him with

1679
02:14:12,771 --> 02:14:23,893
this insanely hard hit-- you connected real hard--
somehow, he shrugs it off and turns to you and

1680
02:14:23,893 --> 02:14:28,650
sneers at you. He does take some damage, but it
doesn't seem like it's as much as you thought it would be.

1681
02:14:28,650 --> 02:14:33,743
LIAM: But you got maximum damage on that attack,
which is rare.

1682
02:14:33,743 --> 02:14:45,671
SAM: Okay. That was Frankfurt. Kingston, you're
up. While this is all happening, Obby says, "Obby

1683
02:14:45,671 --> 02:14:50,472
"the Rat does not like this." And he leaves.

1684
02:14:50,472 --> 02:14:52,976
MARY: Bye, Obby!

1685
02:14:52,976 --> 02:14:54,441
BRIAN: Obby, goddamn.

1686
02:14:54,441 --> 02:14:55,888
ERIC: Where you going?

1687
02:14:55,888 --> 02:14:58,579
ASHLY: Love you, Obby. Nice to see you.

1688
02:14:58,579 --> 02:15:05,754
BRIAN: Hey, does kidnapper guy seem hostile
towards anyone else?

1689
02:15:05,754 --> 02:15:12,521
SAM: He has not even looked at anyone else.
Singularly focused on Holly, has not uttered a

1690
02:15:12,521 --> 02:15:16,524
word, except he did turn around to look at
Frankfurt when he hit him,

1691
02:15:16,524 --> 02:15:18,111
just because he was pissed.

1692
02:15:18,111 --> 02:15:20,612
BRIAN: Can I try Blindness on Frankfurt again?

1693
02:15:20,612 --> 02:15:23,906
SAM: Glad you've got your priorities right. Go for
it.

1694
02:15:23,906 --> 02:15:27,376
BRIAN: Well, no one's attacking me. I don't give a
shit about this kid. I don't care about the guy

1695
02:15:27,376 --> 02:15:29,959
taking the kid, but this guy fucked my wife.

1696
02:15:29,959 --> 02:15:31,319
MARY: You fuck my wife?

1697
02:15:31,319 --> 02:15:33,671
BRIAN: Did you shampoo my wife? Blindness.

1698
02:15:33,671 --> 02:15:43,534
SAM: Go ahead. So your spell DC is 14, I think.
Eric, roll a d20. What's Blindness? Constitution?

1699
02:15:43,534 --> 02:15:45,414
Or is it wisdom?

1700
02:15:45,414 --> 02:15:51,879
BRIAN: It's going to be (singing) blinded by the
light, wrapped up a like a-- constitution.

1701
02:15:51,879 --> 02:15:55,356
SAM: Constitution. Roll a d20, add your
constitution saving modifier.

1702
02:15:55,356 --> 02:16:04,880
LIAM: Constitution. You've been rolling real well
tonight, Eric. And you still are. It's a 23 total.

1703
02:16:04,880 --> 02:16:12,291
SAM: This tickle on the back of your neck again.
Nothing happens. You are blue-balling so hard for

1704
02:16:12,291 --> 02:16:16,132
your spells. I hope you're marking these off. You
don't get infinite spells.

1705
02:16:16,132 --> 02:16:23,633
BRIAN: I am marking them off, Samuel. (whispering)
Which ones have I used? I'm kidding.

1706
02:16:23,633 --> 02:16:28,538
SAM: Any bonus actions? Anything else? Any
healing? You good, Brian?

1707
02:16:28,538 --> 02:16:38,531
BRIAN: Oh, am I still on the other side of the
garlic nutsack? I would like to move to where that

1708
02:16:38,531 --> 02:16:41,493
torch is over by the woman that's prone.

1709
02:16:41,493 --> 02:16:43,108
SAM: You're moving away from the action.

1710
02:16:43,108 --> 02:16:49,540
BRIAN: I would like to move away from the action
to the torch and face back towards the crowd. And

1711
02:16:49,540 --> 02:16:54,864
as my bonus action, can I cast a cantrip as my
bonus action? Actually, you know what? I'm good.

1712
02:16:54,864 --> 02:17:02,846
SAM: Great. Okay. Kidnapper guy with Holly makes
his way all the way to this trapdoor--

1713
02:17:02,846 --> 02:17:06,996
MARY: Remember, he's only ten feet. He can only
move ten feet because I Ray of Frosted him.

1714
02:17:06,996 --> 02:17:10,090
SAM: That's if his movement is 20, which it is
not.

1715
02:17:10,090 --> 02:17:12,584
MARY: I thought it's move to ten.

1716
02:17:12,584 --> 02:17:14,419
SAM: I thought you said it moves in half.

1717
02:17:14,419 --> 02:17:16,199
MARY: Oh, it's reduced <i>to</i> ten.

1718
02:17:16,199 --> 02:17:24,651
SAM: To ten? Shit. Well, then you are correct. So
let's say five, ten, uses his action to dash,

1719
02:17:24,651 --> 02:17:26,500
five, ten.

1720
02:17:26,500 --> 02:17:32,581
MARY: Oh, I'm sorry. You are right. It was reduced
<i>by</i> ten feet until the start of my next turn.

1721
02:17:32,581 --> 02:17:37,504
SAM: Then he's fine. He makes it there in one
clean dash, uses his bonus to flip open the

1722
02:17:37,504 --> 02:17:46,434
trapdoor. Just for good measure, he touches this
guy, who hasn't done anything wrong and he takes--

1723
02:17:46,434 --> 02:17:53,156
he's dead. Yeah. He dies.

1724
02:17:53,156 --> 02:17:56,109
BRIAN: By what method did he kill him?

1725
02:17:56,109 --> 02:18:02,406
SAM: He just touched him. The trapdoor is open,
and he is gone, and that's where we'll take our break.

1726
02:18:02,406 --> 02:18:05,306
LIAM: Fuck that guy!

1727
02:18:05,306 --> 02:18:10,461
SAM: Thank you so much for playing so far, guys.
We'll have more when we come back.

1728
02:18:10,461 --> 02:18:14,765
(cheering and applause)

1729
02:18:14,765 --> 02:18:21,526
LIAM: Just for the record, when I sat in the
chair, I'd at least directed-- DMed to

1730
02:18:21,526 --> 02:18:26,991
eight-year-olds once or twice. Sam came in blind,
hot. So hot.

1731
02:18:26,991 --> 02:18:35,240
BRIAN: Can I just say I now fully understand the
Travis knee shaking feverishly under the table? I

1732
02:18:35,240 --> 02:18:36,668
now get it.

1733
02:18:36,668 --> 02:18:38,979
SAM: Okay. So we're going to (voice breaking) give
away--

1734
02:18:38,979 --> 02:18:43,535
(laughter)

1735
02:18:43,535 --> 02:18:50,138
SAM: We're going to give away this-- our good
friends at CritRole. Not Wyrmwood. Our good

1736
02:18:50,138 --> 02:18:54,423
friends at Wyrmwood have this beautiful dice
thing. I don't know what it's called. It's English

1737
02:18:54,423 --> 02:19:01,657
wych wood. It is a elm burl hero vault, and we
will be giving this away to one lucky fan in the

1738
02:19:01,657 --> 02:19:11,369
chatroom. The code word for winning this fine
thing is meow, M-E-O-W, meow. Please enter. We'll

1739
02:19:11,369 --> 02:19:15,092
announce the winner after the break. Let's keep it
a quick break, guys. This is fun.

1740
02:19:15,092 --> 02:19:20,333
(cheering)

1741
02:19:20,333 --> 02:19:22,092
BRIAN: Eric Meowza.

1742
02:19:22,092 --> 02:19:24,214
SAM: Yes. (sighs) Oh god.

1743
02:19:24,214 --> 02:19:26,170
(laughter)

1744
02:19:26,170 --> 02:19:28,520
MARY: Yay, Sam!

1745
02:19:28,520 --> 02:19:30,286
SAM: Are we out? Come on.

1746
02:19:30,286 --> 02:37:58,530
[break]

1747
02:37:58,530 --> 02:37:59,990
LIAM: Clit-rota.

1748
02:37:59,990 --> 02:38:01,737
SAM: I'm pretty sure that was on.

1749
02:38:01,737 --> 02:38:04,563
ERIC: And we're back.

1750
02:38:04,563 --> 02:38:11,301
SAM: And we're back! Congratulations to the winner
in chat of this fantabulous Critical Role English

1751
02:38:11,301 --> 02:38:23,474
wych elm burl hero vault from Wyrmwood Gaming.
CholieAmenthys is the winner. Danoba will contact

1752
02:38:23,569 --> 02:38:27,680
you shortly for your shipping information.
Congratulations and meow.

1753
02:38:27,680 --> 02:38:29,798
LIAM: CholieAmenthys?

1754
02:38:29,798 --> 02:38:32,609
SAM: Yeah, CholieAmenthys.

1755
02:38:32,609 --> 02:38:34,898
LIAM: Punchy. Pithy.

1756
02:38:34,898 --> 02:38:44,793
SAM: So guys, when last we left, a mysterious
figure, who emanated heat, had grabbed Holly, the

1757
02:38:44,793 --> 02:38:53,894
little girl, who Frankfurt and Obby-- oh, we need
music-- were transporting, tore across the bar,

1758
02:38:53,894 --> 02:39:00,261
and went down into this trapdoor. You are all
confused, looking around; there's still fights

1759
02:39:00,261 --> 02:39:03,680
going on. What would you like to do? Go.

1760
02:39:03,680 --> 02:39:06,912
LIAM: I'm moving towards the door immediately, the
trapdoor.

1761
02:39:06,912 --> 02:39:11,306
MARY: Instantly. I grab Frankfurt, and off we go.

1762
02:39:11,306 --> 02:39:15,579
SAM: Okay, so you're all converging around the
trap door. Kingston, are you with them?

1763
02:39:15,579 --> 02:39:16,827
BRIAN: Yes.

1764
02:39:16,827 --> 02:39:19,600
ASHLY: If everyone else is going to fucking do it,
then yeah.

1765
02:39:19,600 --> 02:39:24,955
LIAM: As I walk, I'm casting Shield of Faith on
myself. It just boosts my AC, that's all.

1766
02:39:24,955 --> 02:39:27,425
MARY: And I still have three bottles of Greep.

1767
02:39:27,425 --> 02:39:36,356
SAM: Oh shit. Okay, you get to the top of the open
trapdoor, and look down into darkness.

1768
02:39:36,356 --> 02:39:38,100
ASHLY: I can see in darkness.

1769
02:39:38,100 --> 02:39:41,516
SAM: Sure, yeah. Many of you have darkvision. It's
okay, guys.

1770
02:39:41,516 --> 02:39:44,619
ASHLY: I got really excited that I had an ability
to do.

1771
02:39:44,619 --> 02:39:47,460
BRIAN: I became Laura for a second. "Actually--"

1772
02:39:47,460 --> 02:39:50,722
SAM: Clothesline has no pants. Both of your
genitals are exposed.

1773
02:39:50,722 --> 02:39:52,768
ASHLY: Free and clear in the wind.

1774
02:39:52,768 --> 02:40:00,722
SAM: So who's going first? Who's going second? Are
you going to talk to each other at all? You're

1775
02:40:00,722 --> 02:40:05,538
just going to go? Are you going to hit each other?
What's happening? Anyone want to go in first?

1776
02:40:05,538 --> 02:40:09,966
LIAM: I'm going to kick the bard in the ass, and
when I kick him in the ass, I'm going to cast

1777
02:40:09,966 --> 02:40:12,601
Light on his ass as he falls down into the hole.

1778
02:40:12,601 --> 02:40:14,591
SAM: You can cast Light on an ass?

1779
02:40:14,591 --> 02:40:22,419
LIAM: It's anything I touch, and it's a cantrip,
so his ass lights up as he falls down the hole.

1780
02:40:22,419 --> 02:40:25,359
SAM: All right, so yes. Kingston, you fall in
first.

1781
02:40:25,359 --> 02:40:28,278
BRIAN: Am I like propeller guy in Titanic?

1782
02:40:28,278 --> 02:40:33,836
SAM: Sure. Yep. In fact, roll an athletics check.

1783
02:40:33,836 --> 02:40:36,758
BRIAN: Okay, thought that'd be great. All right,
let's use Gil.

1784
02:40:36,758 --> 02:40:38,853
SAM: Or acrobatics, whatever's higher for you.

1785
02:40:38,853 --> 02:40:42,476
BRIAN: Well, you made the print so goddamn small
on my character sheet.

1786
02:40:42,476 --> 02:40:46,438
SAM: Sorry. Acrobatics is probably higher for
you.

1787
02:40:46,438 --> 02:40:54,141
BRIAN: Don't fuck me, Gil! Oh wow. Acrobatics?
Let's go ahead and call that a 22.

1788
02:40:54,141 --> 02:41:00,843
SAM: Whoa, shit. You're familiar with this tavern
and all of its layout because you live here, so

1789
02:41:00,843 --> 02:41:06,562
you land like a cat in a three-point landing at
the foot of this darkened ladder/stairs.

1790
02:41:06,562 --> 02:41:09,136
BRIAN: If you don't realize, I'm into cats.

1791
02:41:09,136 --> 02:41:12,348
SAM: How long does Light last, by the way?

1792
02:41:12,348 --> 02:41:14,410
LIAM: Oh, let's see how long that lasts.

1793
02:41:14,410 --> 02:41:16,470
BRIAN: Do I feel a sensation on my bum?

1794
02:41:16,470 --> 02:41:19,495
LIAM: One hour. So Kingston's ass is lit up.

1795
02:41:19,495 --> 02:41:20,875
SAM: Is it concentration or anything?

1796
02:41:20,875 --> 02:41:23,758
LIAM: No, it's a really easy spell for many of
us.

1797
02:41:23,758 --> 02:41:34,978
BRIAN: My ass is a beam of light for one hour? A
beacon of light for one hour? Can I bend over and

1798
02:41:34,978 --> 02:41:36,435
blind an enemy?

1799
02:41:36,435 --> 02:41:46,646
SAM: If you shove your ass close to them, it would
probably affect them at some point. So you are a

1800
02:41:46,646 --> 02:41:53,207
lightning bug, and your ass is illuminating this
whole space down here. Where did the figures go, Liam?

1801
02:41:53,207 --> 02:41:57,582
LIAM: On your other side, Sam.

1802
02:41:57,582 --> 02:42:02,586
SAM: Oh, there they are. Let's place you guys
around somewhere, haphazardly. Oh god, this

1803
02:42:02,586 --> 02:42:04,809
thing's so far. I can't do it.

1804
02:42:04,809 --> 02:42:09,834
LIAM: I'll help. Are they here or are they here?
What's our marching order, DM?

1805
02:42:09,834 --> 02:42:12,137
SAM: There's no marching order; it's a room.

1806
02:42:12,137 --> 02:42:16,219
LIAM: We shoved the bard down first. I'll go after
him.

1807
02:42:16,219 --> 02:42:21,389
SAM: He fell down, so he's over here, you guys
can-- who wants to go next?

1808
02:42:21,389 --> 02:42:30,283
ASHLY: Wait. I don't want this fucking thing,
whatever it is, Creepy McCreeperson over here.

1809
02:42:30,283 --> 02:42:37,250
Excuse me! You took your little icy tentacles and
tried to put them on the back of my head! We need

1810
02:42:37,250 --> 02:42:38,620
to restrain her. Something.

1811
02:42:38,620 --> 02:42:44,418
BRIAN: As I'm falling, I sing, (singing) Let my ass lighten
the way.

1812
02:42:44,418 --> 02:42:48,900
SAM and BRIAN: (singing) To your heart.

1813
02:42:48,900 --> 02:42:54,484
SAM: Okay, is anyone going to follow Clothesline's
suggestion?

1814
02:42:54,484 --> 02:42:57,211
ASHLY: Anybody? You want her just roaming around?

1815
02:42:57,211 --> 02:43:00,565
MARY: My concern is for other things at the
moment.

1816
02:43:00,565 --> 02:43:03,392
ERIC: She hasn't done anything to me.

1817
02:43:03,392 --> 02:43:12,545
BRIAN: What happened to your necklace? Wait, I
couldn't talk to him, I'm falling down a tunnel

1818
02:43:12,545 --> 02:43:14,466
with my ass made of light.

1819
02:43:14,466 --> 02:43:18,341
SAM: You're at the bottom, and Jayne is coming
down the steps right behind you.

1820
02:43:18,341 --> 02:43:20,071
MARY: What do you see down there?

1821
02:43:20,071 --> 02:43:24,867
LIAM: We have something to do. You can ask me lots
of questions later. Let's just kill the thing and

1822
02:43:24,867 --> 02:43:26,480
get the girl, all right?

1823
02:43:26,480 --> 02:43:28,704
BRIAN: Do you know what this thing is?

1824
02:43:28,704 --> 02:43:31,783
LIAM: I do not.

1825
02:43:31,783 --> 02:43:34,616
BRIAN: Do you know who the girl is?

1826
02:43:34,616 --> 02:43:37,370
LIAM: Sort of.

1827
02:43:37,370 --> 02:43:42,557
BRIAN: Tell me, and I'll give you some of
Gryffin's Greep.

1828
02:43:42,557 --> 02:43:46,882
SAM: As you talk, you all make it down there
slowly, filling the room.

1829
02:43:46,882 --> 02:43:50,510
LIAM: I walk past the idiot and start walking down
the hallway.

1830
02:43:50,510 --> 02:43:54,986
BRIAN: Piece of shit. I cast Talk to Me at Once!

1831
02:43:54,986 --> 02:44:05,056
SAM: I could pull it towards me. It's going to
wreck some microphones over there. Okay. I should

1832
02:44:05,056 --> 02:44:08,975
tell you, before you start walking, at the foot of
the stairs there's a single lantern casting a dim

1833
02:44:08,975 --> 02:44:13,249
glow, although that doesn't matter because you've
got Light coming out of your ass. On the walls are

1834
02:44:13,249 --> 02:44:18,450
graffiti, seemingly from patrons who've wandered
down here. One reads, "For a good time, do not

1835
02:44:18,450 --> 02:44:24,155
"call Isabelle." Another reads, "Do you know why
they call him Obby the Rat? Because his dick is

1836
02:44:24,155 --> 02:44:31,186
"the size of a rodent." And the other one says,
"What do you call a pile of tabaxi? A Meowntain."

1837
02:44:31,186 --> 02:44:33,970
BRIAN: Respect.

1838
02:44:33,970 --> 02:44:39,140
SAM: Straight on at the bottom of the steps, a
narrow corridor leading out around a slight

1839
02:44:39,140 --> 02:44:45,158
bend, obscuring the view. To the other direction,
it's a dead wall, however there is a space

1840
02:44:45,158 --> 02:44:51,147
underneath the back of the stairway. It is dank
and cold. Light frost covers the floor, because

1841
02:44:51,147 --> 02:44:55,482
you are out of that hot bar, now. So you would like
to continue down this hall?

1842
02:44:55,482 --> 02:45:03,998
LIAM: Yeah, I'm looking as carefully as I can into
the next space. I will peer for enemies or the

1843
02:45:03,998 --> 02:45:06,126
people we're following or anything.

1844
02:45:06,126 --> 02:45:21,140
SAM: Okay. This curves this way and leads to a
door. The corridor proceeds around to the left. As

1845
02:45:21,140 --> 02:45:28,713
you proceed through it, Clothesline has to bend a
little to make it through. Frankfurt feels roomy.

1846
02:45:28,713 --> 02:45:36,336
It ends with a simple wooden door and a rusty
knob. Are you still in the same marching order?

1847
02:45:36,336 --> 02:45:38,170
Kingston first or Kingston second?

1848
02:45:38,170 --> 02:45:42,312
LIAM: I call down over my shoulder and say: hey,
ass kicker!

1849
02:45:42,312 --> 02:45:43,561
SAM: That's you.

1850
02:45:43,561 --> 02:45:46,076
LIAM: No, it's not. Clothesline, get up here.

1851
02:45:46,076 --> 02:45:47,654
BRIAN: I'm ass flicker.

1852
02:45:47,654 --> 02:45:50,532
ASHLY: Fuck you! I don't follow your orders. You
tried to kill me!

1853
02:45:50,532 --> 02:45:53,077
MARY: I want to investigate what's under the
stairs.

1854
02:45:53,077 --> 02:45:55,919
ASHLY: I don't even know why I'm still here!

1855
02:45:55,919 --> 02:46:01,551
SAM: So nobody is going with you right now, Jayne.
You're in front of a door. Gryffin, can you roll

1856
02:46:01,551 --> 02:46:04,646
an investigation check?

1857
02:46:04,646 --> 02:46:09,263
LIAM: And I'm going to do my best to see if
there's any kind of trap on the door I'm looking at.

1858
02:46:09,263 --> 02:46:14,775
MARY: 18.

1859
02:46:14,775 --> 02:46:26,123
SAM: 18. Yes. All right. There is a false wall
here that opens up into another corridor that

1860
02:46:26,123 --> 02:46:36,840
leads this way. Let me see how I described it.
Yes. Okay. It empties out into a wider room, and

1861
02:46:36,840 --> 02:46:40,957
I'm going to do this. All right, so what would you
like to do?

1862
02:46:40,957 --> 02:46:44,801
MARY: Can I check to see if there's any trace of
footprints or anything?

1863
02:46:44,801 --> 02:46:47,929
SAM: Sure, roll a perception check.

1864
02:46:47,929 --> 02:46:56,460
MARY: (winces) I'm not going to waste that though.
Ten.

1865
02:46:56,460 --> 02:47:03,405
SAM: Ten? That's what you needed. So there is
frost everywhere. It's super cold down here,

1866
02:47:03,405 --> 02:47:10,297
because we're underground in a cellar area, and
it's winter. Yeah, now you're also getting cold.

1867
02:47:10,297 --> 02:47:12,050
BRIAN: I don't have a fucking shirt on!

1868
02:47:12,050 --> 02:47:14,543
MARY: Your nipples are rock-hard.

1869
02:47:14,543 --> 02:47:16,330
BRIAN: Good thing they're pierced.

1870
02:47:16,330 --> 02:47:21,253
SAM: Gryffin, you notice that there's less frost
on the floor under the stairs and through this

1871
02:47:21,253 --> 02:47:24,614
hallway than on the rest of the downstairs area.

1872
02:47:24,614 --> 02:47:26,689
MARY: Are there any footprints that I can see?

1873
02:47:26,689 --> 02:47:34,078
SAM: There are no footprints. If anything it's
just a straight line. You also notice something

1874
02:47:34,078 --> 02:47:39,057
else: two things, actually. Would you like the one
on the left or the one on the right?

1875
02:47:39,057 --> 02:47:40,770
MARY: Left, please.

1876
02:47:40,770 --> 02:47:43,774
SAM: Left? Read that out loud.

1877
02:47:43,774 --> 02:47:50,319
MARY: Oh, there's a fucking snake on the left!
Oops, a fucking snake just bit me. I take one

1878
02:47:50,319 --> 02:47:57,834
point damage and I make a constitution save
versus ten.

1879
02:47:57,834 --> 02:48:01,889
ASHLY: It literally says "a fucking snake" by the
way.

1880
02:48:01,995 --> 02:48:10,881
MARY: Constitution, which, okay. Ten.

1881
02:48:10,881 --> 02:48:15,286
SAM: That saves. You're fine. Just one point of
damage.

1882
02:48:15,286 --> 02:48:18,555
MARY: Goddamn it! And I step on the fucking
snake.

1883
02:48:18,555 --> 02:48:21,404
SAM: It's dead. Would you like the thing on the
right?

1884
02:48:21,404 --> 02:48:29,915
MARY: Yes. Another fucking snake. Whoa! I will
take that.

1885
02:48:29,915 --> 02:48:35,172
SAM: Okay. Do you proceed into this room or do you
hang out?

1886
02:48:35,172 --> 02:48:43,602
MARY: I turn around and I say: kitty-kitty, there
seems to be another room down here and it seems to

1887
02:48:43,602 --> 02:48:48,522
me that the frost is dissipating a bit on the
floor. What do you think we should do? There's no

1888
02:48:48,522 --> 02:48:52,157
sign of footprints, but I don't know that there
were footprints on the other way. Jayne, do you

1889
02:48:52,157 --> 02:48:54,762
see footprints? Besides your own, of course.

1890
02:48:54,762 --> 02:48:58,357
LIAM: I'm looking at the door in front of me and
seeing if I can see anything hinky with it.

1891
02:48:58,357 --> 02:49:00,480
SAM: Sure. Make an investigation check.

1892
02:49:00,480 --> 02:49:01,861
LIAM: Natural 20.

1893
02:49:01,861 --> 02:49:05,439
SAM: The door is not locked and not trapped.

1894
02:49:05,439 --> 02:49:07,824
LIAM: Well, I'm going to go inside.

1895
02:49:07,824 --> 02:49:17,383
SAM: You're so freaky. It's a rather long room
with boxes everywhere. Seems to be some sort of

1896
02:49:17,383 --> 02:49:28,706
storage area. In the middle is a table with
potions and beakers on it. A closet over here. It

1897
02:49:28,706 --> 02:49:35,512
is not lit at all. Let's see what I said about it.
A single lantern glows near the door, casting dark

1898
02:49:35,512 --> 02:49:42,485
shadows everywhere. Stacked boxes all around.
Weirdly, the smell of cabbage permeates the air.

1899
02:49:42,485 --> 02:49:46,846
In the center of the room, a wooden table
resembling a crude chemistry lab. Beakers and

1900
02:49:46,846 --> 02:49:53,675
vials are arranged. A whiff of something strange
hits you. It stings your nose like gasoline. Would

1901
02:49:53,675 --> 02:49:56,922
you like to look around?

1902
02:49:56,922 --> 02:50:00,260
LIAM: I would first like to cast Light again,
because it's a cantrip, I can do it as many times

1903
02:50:00,260 --> 02:50:08,826
as I want, and that means the bard's ass goes out
and I'll say that the grip of my whip lights up

1904
02:50:08,826 --> 02:50:10,652
and I hold it upside down.

1905
02:50:10,652 --> 02:50:13,742
SAM: That's so cool. So you've got a white whip
that's lit up.

1906
02:50:13,742 --> 02:50:16,664
MARY: So it's finally useful, is it?

1907
02:50:16,664 --> 02:50:19,444
LIAM: You're not there.

1908
02:50:19,444 --> 02:50:23,489
MARY: That was Zahra showing up for a moment.

1909
02:50:23,489 --> 02:50:27,332
LIAM: You said there were potions on the table
that I see now.

1910
02:50:27,332 --> 02:50:29,200
SAM: You can investigate that, yeah.

1911
02:50:29,200 --> 02:50:31,529
ASHLY: Is it possible for me at some point to try
to grapple her?

1912
02:50:31,529 --> 02:50:36,861
SAM: To grapple Jayne? If you want to walk down
the hall, you can try.

1913
02:50:36,861 --> 02:50:44,161
LIAM: I've entered the room and I want to inspect
the potions you said there were on the table?

1914
02:50:44,161 --> 02:50:45,874
SAM: Okay, roll an investigation check.

1915
02:50:45,874 --> 02:50:48,491
ASHLY: Can I move toward the room?

1916
02:50:48,491 --> 02:50:50,153
SAM: Sure.

1917
02:50:50,153 --> 02:50:52,556
ASHLY: And try to grapple Jayne?

1918
02:50:52,556 --> 02:50:54,172
LIAM: Ten.

1919
02:50:54,172 --> 02:51:00,166
SAM: Okay, ten is what you needed. Upon further
inspection, you use your light to reveal the

1920
02:51:00,166 --> 02:51:06,069
labels on the jugs. Someone has been mixing liquor
down here. After a minute of study, you figure out

1921
02:51:06,069 --> 02:51:11,992
that the house alcohol, Greep, is made right here,
and the formula is remarkably basic. It is four

1922
02:51:11,992 --> 02:51:19,113
parts standard rice wine, one part balsamic
vinegar, one part simple syrup, and one part pure

1923
02:51:19,113 --> 02:51:25,622
kerosene. Everyone who has drank it has been
drinking kerosene the whole night.

1924
02:51:25,622 --> 02:51:30,837
LIAM: I jot that down on a scrap of paper and put
it away, because I am a businesswoman, as well.

1925
02:51:30,837 --> 02:51:34,990
SAM: That's it. That's all you find, currently.

1926
02:51:34,990 --> 02:51:39,483
LIAM: Okay. I will start back and find the
catwoman in the doorway.

1927
02:51:39,483 --> 02:51:42,384
SAM: Okay. Catwoman, what would you like to do?

1928
02:51:42,384 --> 02:51:48,007
ASHLY: Hi, Jayne. And I would like to grapple her
by the neck and hold her aloft.

1929
02:51:48,007 --> 02:51:49,565
MARY: Oh hi, Jayne.

1930
02:51:49,565 --> 02:51:53,427
SAM: How's Sanctuary going? Still on?

1931
02:51:53,427 --> 02:51:57,936
LIAM: It's up to you. If ten minutes have passed
since I cast it?

1932
02:51:57,936 --> 02:52:04,792
SAM: It has not been ten minutes. So you'll have
to make a wisdom saving throw against 14.

1933
02:52:04,792 --> 02:52:07,863
ASHLY: Shit. Well, she's not very smart so she
would try. Natural 20.

1934
02:52:07,863 --> 02:52:13,104
LIAM: That's the third one for Burch!

1935
02:52:13,104 --> 02:52:18,935
SAM: So sadly, that does not mean that you
grapple. That means that you have the fortitude to

1936
02:52:18,935 --> 02:52:20,383
attempt to grapple.

1937
02:52:20,383 --> 02:52:28,233
ASHLY: It'd be really sad if it fails right now. I
got a nine. Is there anything I could apply to it?

1938
02:52:28,233 --> 02:52:31,251
SAM: Yeah, strength, and you're pretty strong.

1939
02:52:31,251 --> 02:52:32,726
ASHLY: So it's 12.

1940
02:52:32,726 --> 02:52:35,607
SAM: Wait, three? Your strength is three? No, it's
not.

1941
02:52:35,607 --> 02:52:36,960
ASHLY: Plus three modifier?

1942
02:52:36,960 --> 02:52:38,696
SAM: Really? I thought you were stronger than
that.

1943
02:52:38,696 --> 02:52:40,507
ASHLY: Wait, or is it this one? Saving throw?

1944
02:52:40,507 --> 02:52:41,669
SAM: No, you're right.

1945
02:52:41,669 --> 02:52:44,472
LIAM: And I have to roll versus it. So you got a
what total?

1946
02:52:44,472 --> 02:52:45,905
SAM: 12.

1947
02:52:45,905 --> 02:52:49,416
LIAM: That's a big four.

1948
02:52:49,416 --> 02:52:52,830
(laughter)

1949
02:52:52,830 --> 02:52:58,821
BRIAN: I'm still so used to Liam rolling and then
going: 196.

1950
02:52:58,821 --> 02:53:04,272
LIAM: The big thing tonight is I'm like: luck--
no. Phantom limb syndrome.

1951
02:53:04,272 --> 02:53:10,108
SAM: Okay, so you are grappled and restrained. You
both can't move or anything, unless you want to

1952
02:53:10,108 --> 02:53:12,067
try to drag her somewhere.

1953
02:53:12,067 --> 02:53:19,950
ASHLY: I want to be like: what the fuck, man? You
brought me here. I'm doing you a favor. Why did

1954
02:53:19,950 --> 02:53:21,838
you try to fucking kill me?

1955
02:53:21,838 --> 02:53:25,957
LIAM: (strained) It was probably a bad idea.

1956
02:53:25,957 --> 02:53:32,789
ASHLY: Bad idea, yeah. So? How are you going to
make it up to me?

1957
02:53:32,789 --> 02:53:39,896
LIAM: (strained) I think you need to kill me
later. I think we need to survive this basement.

1958
02:53:39,896 --> 02:53:44,387
ASHLY: I don't give a fuck about this girl or
anything going on with you, so if you don't want

1959
02:53:44,387 --> 02:53:48,122
to die right now, or have me leave and fucking
feed you to these dogs--

1960
02:53:48,122 --> 02:53:50,212
LIAM: We're talking a long time. Can I cast a
spell?

1961
02:53:50,212 --> 02:53:51,960
SAM: Sure, yeah.

1962
02:53:51,960 --> 02:53:59,553
LIAM: I would like to cast Inflict Wounds at
second level. Make a melee spell attack against a

1963
02:53:59,553 --> 02:54:09,167
creature you reach. Okay. She's done. That is
a 19 plus six. That is a 25.

1964
02:54:09,167 --> 02:54:11,133
SAM: What does this spell do?

1965
02:54:11,133 --> 02:54:14,995
LIAM: This is Inflict Wounds. Make a melee spell
attack against a creature you can reach. On a hit,

1966
02:54:14,995 --> 02:54:26,954
the target takes 3d10 necrotic damage. Except I'm
doing it at second level, so it's 4d10. And so my

1967
02:54:26,954 --> 02:54:42,943
hand just grips her forearm and death filters
through it. Ten. 19. 29.

1968
02:54:43,012 --> 02:55:05,803
ASHLY and MARY: (singing) I have three hit points,
just three hit points. I am about to die.

1969
02:55:05,803 --> 02:55:08,884
SAM: That was beautiful. And sad.

1970
02:55:08,884 --> 02:55:10,686
LIAM: Not even the bard.

1971
02:55:10,686 --> 02:55:11,807
ASHLY: You know what?

1972
02:55:11,807 --> 02:55:14,729
SAM: All right, so you are released, Jayne, from
her grapple.

1973
02:55:14,729 --> 02:55:20,348
ASHLY: Whatever you want to do is fine. That was
fine. Everything is fine. What do you need, buddy?

1974
02:55:20,348 --> 02:55:27,476
BRIAN: Can I do something? Since we're all in the
same area. Am I standing next to Frankfurt?

1975
02:55:27,476 --> 02:55:33,454
ERIC: Ah, Jesus! It's freezing down here.

1976
02:55:33,454 --> 02:55:43,688
ASHLY: I have two hit points left! I'm bad at
math. I have two hit points left. So am I knocked out?

1977
02:55:43,688 --> 02:55:50,992
LIAM: No, you're awake, you motherfucker!

1978
02:55:50,992 --> 02:55:53,335
SAM: You are feeling really shitty right now.

1979
02:55:53,335 --> 02:55:56,784
BRIAN: Wait! Did she do the 1d6 to her attack for
the bardic inspiration that I gave you?

1980
02:55:56,784 --> 02:55:58,365
MARY: She hasn't used it yet.

1981
02:55:58,365 --> 02:56:00,948
LIAM: That's water under the bridge, Brain.

1982
02:56:00,948 --> 02:56:03,635
BRIAN: Fuck the bridge!

1983
02:56:03,635 --> 02:56:06,267
MARY: Use it next time for something!

1984
02:56:06,267 --> 02:56:14,284
BRIAN: Okay. Can I force myself to throw up Greep
onto him? It says I have a candle, can I then

1985
02:56:14,284 --> 02:56:19,818
light that candle and light Frankfurt on fire
because I threw Greep up on to him?

1986
02:56:19,818 --> 02:56:22,737
SAM: I mean, you can certainly make an attempt.

1987
02:56:22,737 --> 02:56:24,915
MARY: That's 3,000 actions.

1988
02:56:24,915 --> 02:56:30,355
LIAM: Gagging your ass and then lighting a candle
seems like possibly three actions.

1989
02:56:30,355 --> 02:56:36,039
BRIAN: Have you ever had someone with a gnome
bard-sized penis steal your wife from you?

1990
02:56:36,039 --> 02:56:43,041
SAM: So many times. Go ahead and make a
constitution saving throw to see if you can make

1991
02:56:43,041 --> 02:56:45,118
yourself throw up.

1992
02:56:45,118 --> 02:56:48,445
LIAM: DND is all about negotiation.

1993
02:56:48,445 --> 02:56:57,914
BRIAN: Constitution saving. We're going to go with
a 12-- or no, 11.

1994
02:56:57,914 --> 02:57:04,152
SAM: You stick your fingers down your throat to
throw up, but it doesn't work. You gag and dry

1995
02:57:04,152 --> 02:57:07,301
heave for a while, and nothing comes up,
unfortunately.

1996
02:57:07,301 --> 02:57:09,652
BRIAN: So a typical night at the tavern.

1997
02:57:09,652 --> 02:57:15,286
MARY: All right, you two, would you stop it for
the moment? Seriously. We have a mission here, or

1998
02:57:15,286 --> 02:57:19,173
at least you and I have a mission and I do not
want to-- Look, Kingston, I love your work, I

1999
02:57:19,173 --> 02:57:22,896
really do and I realize that you're a fantastic
writer and everything else, but there are other

2000
02:57:22,896 --> 02:57:27,905
things to do right now. There is a room underneath
the stairs. Shall we check it out? It gets

2001
02:57:27,905 --> 02:57:29,803
increasingly warmer, it seems.

2002
02:57:29,803 --> 02:57:32,130
BRIAN: Are the elderly whores in there?

2003
02:57:32,130 --> 02:57:35,233
MARY: Yes! They most certainly are.

2004
02:57:35,233 --> 02:57:36,666
BRIAN: Let's go.

2005
02:57:36,666 --> 02:57:39,745
MARY: (whispering) Frankfurt, come with me and
we'll get to her. Yes.

2006
02:57:39,745 --> 02:57:44,779
SAM: Who's going down there? You three?

2007
02:57:44,779 --> 02:57:46,083
ERIC: Yeah.

2008
02:57:46,083 --> 02:57:48,632
MARY: The others split up and go rogue. Whoa!

2009
02:57:48,632 --> 02:57:56,328
SAM: As you walk in, you see that the walls of
this part of the tunnel are rough as if they had

2010
02:57:56,328 --> 02:58:01,377
been clawed out of the rocks. It's very cold; you
can see your breath as you enter. It's also pitch

2011
02:58:01,377 --> 02:58:09,824
black because light is gone. Those of you with
darkvision can faintly see that this tunnel-- I'm

2012
02:58:09,824 --> 02:58:14,679
going to skip that part, in the interest of time.
That this tunnel continues into darkness for a

2013
02:58:14,679 --> 02:58:22,896
wide oval anteroom. It's a bit oddly shaped to be
a storage room; it's about 20 feet wide with a 15

2014
02:58:22,896 --> 02:58:24,635
foot coved ceiling.

2015
02:58:24,635 --> 02:58:31,425
BRIAN: My ass is an hour?

2016
02:58:31,425 --> 02:58:33,479
SAM: When he cast Light, it went out.

2017
02:58:33,479 --> 02:58:35,143
MARY: Oh. Can I cast Light?

2018
02:58:35,143 --> 02:58:41,502
SAM: Sure, if you would like to? Okay. Things look
nice and bright in here. Four evenly spaced

2019
02:58:41,502 --> 02:58:50,396
pillars are holding up the ceiling, each with
intricate, beautiful carvings. At the other side

2020
02:58:50,396 --> 02:58:56,666
of the room is a single large door. The door seems
to be made of heavy forged iron, with carefully

2021
02:58:56,666 --> 02:59:04,346
inlaid bronze details: images of fire and lizard
tongues. Who would like to do anything or walk

2022
02:59:04,346 --> 02:59:07,127
around or enter? What do you want to do?

2023
02:59:07,127 --> 02:59:10,028
LIAM: While they're thinking about it, can I
talk to the cat?

2024
02:59:10,028 --> 02:59:13,709
SAM: Sure, go ahead.

2025
02:59:13,709 --> 02:59:15,920
LIAM: I'm not a very nice person.

2026
02:59:15,920 --> 02:59:17,452
ASHLY: (strained) I'm gathering that.

2027
02:59:17,452 --> 02:59:31,576
LIAM: Yes. I am a servant of the Chained Oblivion,
and I want <i>everything</i> destroyed. And I know that

2028
02:59:31,576 --> 02:59:37,631
doesn't sync up with your motivation. That's
rough. But I could kill you now.

2029
02:59:37,631 --> 02:59:38,962
ASHLY: Sure, yeah.

2030
02:59:38,962 --> 02:59:44,811
LIAM: Or you could come with me and help me get
this girl. And then maybe you'll make your way out

2031
02:59:44,811 --> 02:59:51,208
of it. Maybe you'll survive. I'm going to give you
a chance because I think you're worth more to me

2032
02:59:51,208 --> 03:00:02,211
alive now than dead. And if you're very nice and
don't argue, I'll even make you feel a little

2033
03:00:02,211 --> 03:00:05,482
better. What do you say?

2034
03:00:05,482 --> 03:00:09,759
ASHLY: That sounds great. It's cool. I'm good.
We're good. Yeah.

2035
03:00:09,759 --> 03:00:13,332
LIAM: Clothesline, I'm not a nice person.

2036
03:00:13,332 --> 03:00:16,923
ASHLY: I get it! I got it from the time when you
almost killed me, yeah. I got it. I'm good.

2037
03:00:16,923 --> 03:00:32,075
LIAM: I facepalm her and cast Cure Wounds. That
is-- I'll tell you. That is eight hit points back

2038
03:00:32,075 --> 03:00:34,511
for you. Hooray, eight, hey!

2039
03:00:34,511 --> 03:00:40,982
ASHLY: Hey, ugh. (coughs) I would say thanks, but
I'm not going to argue. What do you need?

2040
03:00:40,982 --> 03:00:46,188
LIAM: You can try to kill me later. I want the
little red-haired girl, you understand?

2041
03:00:46,188 --> 03:00:49,754
ASHLY: Yeah. Red-haired girl. Got it. Got it,
boss.

2042
03:00:49,754 --> 03:00:50,934
LIAM: Come on.

2043
03:00:50,934 --> 03:00:53,431
SAM: So you join the others?

2044
03:00:53,431 --> 03:00:55,179
LIAM: I'll follow her.

2045
03:00:55,179 --> 03:01:00,246
SAM: All right. So who is looking around the room,
doing something?

2046
03:01:00,246 --> 03:01:01,866
MARY: Can we check for traps?

2047
03:01:01,866 --> 03:01:07,346
SAM: Sure. Make an investigation check. What are
you checking for traps?

2048
03:01:07,346 --> 03:01:09,883
MARY and SAM: The floor.

2049
03:01:09,883 --> 03:01:16,470
BRIAN: You said there was shit written on the
pillar? Can I see if I recognize any of the

2050
03:01:16,470 --> 03:01:17,969
symbols on the pillar?

2051
03:01:17,969 --> 03:01:20,419
SAM: Sure. What languages do you speak?

2052
03:01:20,419 --> 03:01:25,338
BRIAN: I speak Common, Elven, Halfling, Valley
Girl.

2053
03:01:25,338 --> 03:01:30,600
SAM: What was your check, Mary?

2054
03:01:30,600 --> 03:01:34,467
MARY: 18. And I speak Elvish, Abysmal and Common.

2055
03:01:34,467 --> 03:01:44,351
SAM: Abyssal. You're looking at the floor
specifically? Okay. Brian, can you roll an

2056
03:01:44,351 --> 03:01:52,170
investigation check? Okay, so Mary, looking on the
floor you do not see any tiles or anything. It is

2057
03:01:52,170 --> 03:02:00,054
smooth, like poured cement. Seemingly no
traps on the floor. Glancing about the room,

2058
03:02:00,054 --> 03:02:06,244
though, as you step in and sort of use your light
to look around-- you rolled an 18, you said? You

2059
03:02:06,244 --> 03:02:13,496
see cobwebs and grime and dust all over the place.
It's not a very used room. But on the ceiling you

2060
03:02:13,496 --> 03:02:21,720
do notice faint symbols covered in years of
cobwebs and grime. Brian, what did you roll?

2061
03:02:21,720 --> 03:02:25,035
BRIAN: Was it an investigation? 18.

2062
03:02:25,035 --> 03:02:31,986
SAM: Okay. So you cannot read any writing on
these-- you're investigating the pillars? You

2063
03:02:31,986 --> 03:02:35,076
can't read any writing on them, but it's okay
because there's not really any.

2064
03:02:35,076 --> 03:02:37,012
BRIAN: Do I recognize the symbols?

2065
03:02:37,012 --> 03:02:42,709
SAM: There are symbols of serpents carved up and
down on these pillars, way nicer than they need to

2066
03:02:42,709 --> 03:02:48,356
be, and you can see from your excellent
investigation skill that the eyes of the serpents

2067
03:02:48,356 --> 03:02:52,300
have a faint glow of magic in them. They are
definitely trapped.

2068
03:02:52,300 --> 03:03:03,234
BRIAN: We got some weird snake shit going on over
here, guys. I don't want to touch it, but I would

2069
03:03:03,234 --> 03:03:04,952
like it if one of you did.

2070
03:03:04,952 --> 03:03:09,158
MARY: I was bitten by a snake on the way in, so I
would recommend not touching any of the snakes.

2071
03:03:09,158 --> 03:03:13,870
BRIAN: Maybe you're immune now that it bit you and
you could just go touch it and press one of the

2072
03:03:13,870 --> 03:03:17,075
eyes and maybe it won't do anything to you. I
recommend trying all the eyes.

2073
03:03:17,075 --> 03:03:21,505
MARY: It would make such a good story, though, in
your book if you did it, Kingston.

2074
03:03:21,505 --> 03:03:27,890
BRIAN: Oh, I know, but if it goes bad, who will be
around to write the book? Surely a fan such as

2075
03:03:27,890 --> 03:03:30,127
yourself would be dedicated enough to--

2076
03:03:30,127 --> 03:03:32,338
MARY: Did you always write your books or did you
have a ghostwriter?

2077
03:03:32,338 --> 03:03:35,972
BRIAN: Oh, I didn't have a ghostwriter. Are you
kidding me? The pain that I went through. I was

2078
03:03:35,972 --> 03:03:38,536
able to pull from so many different places.

2079
03:03:38,536 --> 03:03:41,880
ASHLY: Could I also do a perception check? Do I
see the symbols on the ceiling?

2080
03:03:41,880 --> 03:03:43,690
SAM: Not yet, not until you roll.

2081
03:03:43,690 --> 03:03:45,941
ASHLY: That is a 19.

2082
03:03:45,941 --> 03:03:50,622
SAM: You definitely see the symbols on the
ceiling. They're all over the place, many of them.

2083
03:03:50,622 --> 03:03:57,429
They appear to be writing in Common. They appear
to be numbers. Lots and lots of numbers. Also,

2084
03:03:57,429 --> 03:04:04,676
glancing about the room you've entered now, behind
this pillar back here you find something. Heads or tails?

2085
03:04:04,676 --> 03:04:07,806
ASHLY: Oh! Tails. Because I'm a cat!

2086
03:04:07,806 --> 03:04:15,944
SAM: Here you go. All right, so that is something
you find.

2087
03:04:15,944 --> 03:04:17,383
MARY: How high is the ceiling?

2088
03:04:17,383 --> 03:04:26,797
SAM: The ceiling is whatever I said before: 25
foot coved ceiling. 25 feet high. And it's covered

2089
03:04:26,797 --> 03:04:30,777
with numbers. They're all hard to make out because
it's dusty.

2090
03:04:30,777 --> 03:04:42,743
MARY: Numbers, huh? I have a feeling we're going
to have to touch one of those.

2091
03:04:42,743 --> 03:04:45,008
ASHLY: Is anyone good with numbers? I'm not great
with numbers.

2092
03:04:45,008 --> 03:04:47,644
BRIAN: And I'm drunk.

2093
03:04:47,644 --> 03:04:51,500
SAM: Okay. From the other side of the door you
hear a girl scream.

2094
03:04:51,500 --> 03:04:52,970
MARY: At the end?

2095
03:04:52,970 --> 03:04:53,966
SAM: Yes.

2096
03:04:53,966 --> 03:04:55,337
MARY: Oh balls. All right.

2097
03:04:55,337 --> 03:04:58,536
BRIAN: That end? Oh shit.

2098
03:04:58,536 --> 03:05:02,234
ASHLY: Hey creepy girl! Are you good with
numbers?

2099
03:05:02,234 --> 03:05:10,840
LIAM: No, but I have other skills. I would like to
cast Command on the dwarf. He has to make a wisdom

2100
03:05:10,840 --> 03:05:19,687
saving throw. So roll the d20 plus three.

2101
03:05:19,687 --> 03:05:23,351
ERIC: Are you allowed to do this? Is he allowed to
do this?

2102
03:05:23,351 --> 03:05:26,122
SAM: Sure, he can do whatever he wants. You can
also hit him over the head if you want.

2103
03:05:26,122 --> 03:05:28,730
LIAM: Not until after this spell is done.

2104
03:05:28,730 --> 03:05:32,920
ERIC: 13!

2105
03:05:32,920 --> 03:05:40,935
LIAM: Aw, 13? Plus three is 16. He beat it! Damn!
He beat it! Spell burned!

2106
03:05:40,935 --> 03:05:43,424
BRIAN: Now you know how I felt all night, Liam
Oberon.

2107
03:05:43,424 --> 03:05:52,001
ERIC: You know, Jayne, I couldn't help but
overhear. You were talking down the hall, and

2108
03:05:52,001 --> 03:06:00,755
these caverns echo. Did I not hear you say that
you may or may not be associated with the Chained

2109
03:06:00,755 --> 03:06:02,166
Oblivion?

2110
03:06:02,166 --> 03:06:05,163
LIAM: Was he anywhere near me when I had that
private conversation?

2111
03:06:05,163 --> 03:06:13,533
SAM: The caverns do carry audio. Why don't you
roll a perception check? A retroactive perception

2112
03:06:13,533 --> 03:06:15,863
check to see if you could hear that?

2113
03:06:15,863 --> 03:06:18,676
ERIC: A straight roll.

2114
03:06:18,676 --> 03:06:21,548
LIAM: Roll high. Catch me out, because I'm
terrible. That's a two.

2115
03:06:21,548 --> 03:06:23,089
ERIC: Two! Fuck!

2116
03:06:23,089 --> 03:06:27,270
SAM: You heard him say, "Jayne's a mailman."

2117
03:06:27,270 --> 03:06:31,931
ERIC: Got to clean my ears.

2118
03:06:31,931 --> 03:06:41,252
SAM: But something about Jayne has been bugging
you a lot. Me too, really. If we're going to be

2119
03:06:41,252 --> 03:06:42,634
honest.

2120
03:06:42,634 --> 03:06:45,581
ERIC: I've got my eye on you, Jayne.

2121
03:06:45,581 --> 03:06:56,549
SAM: So is this where you guys are standing? Where
are you?

2122
03:06:56,549 --> 03:06:58,864
MARY: Yep! That's where you put us.

2123
03:06:58,864 --> 03:07:01,934
BRIAN: I might be leaning against something,
because I'm a little tipsy.

2124
03:07:01,934 --> 03:07:03,728
MARY: I would like to move towards the door.

2125
03:07:03,728 --> 03:07:05,572
BRIAN: Yeah, I'll go with her.

2126
03:07:05,572 --> 03:07:08,347
ASHLY: So there is a door there?

2127
03:07:08,347 --> 03:07:09,681
SAM: That's a door.

2128
03:07:09,681 --> 03:07:11,516
BRIAN: Then there's a girl screaming on the other
side of that door.

2129
03:07:11,516 --> 03:07:17,785
LIAM: Jayne places her hand on Clothesline's
shoulder and says: wait. No, I didn't leave that

2130
03:07:17,785 --> 03:07:22,336
hallway. Whenever she would have walked forward I
would have said, wait.

2131
03:07:22,336 --> 03:07:28,535
SAM: Oh, so she's back here? But she found an
object over there. So she's definitely there?

2132
03:07:28,535 --> 03:07:30,114
LIAM: It's up to you if you wanted to.

2133
03:07:30,114 --> 03:07:31,479
ASHLY: I will do what you say.

2134
03:07:31,479 --> 03:07:33,800
SAM: You can tell her to go back or you can tell
her to wait there, but she's already there.

2135
03:07:33,800 --> 03:07:34,865
LIAM: Come.

2136
03:07:34,865 --> 03:07:36,304
SAM: Come where?

2137
03:07:36,304 --> 03:07:39,837
LIAM: No, I'm at that tunnel entrance. I never
entered.

2138
03:07:39,837 --> 03:07:42,269
SAM: Okay, got it. So you're calling her back?
Great. And Frankie?

2139
03:07:42,269 --> 03:07:44,007
ERIC: I'm going to stay right there.

2140
03:07:44,007 --> 03:07:53,917
SAM: Great. So you take four points of poison
damage as this pillar shoots out a bit of poison.

2141
03:07:53,917 --> 03:07:56,711
You're standing near it, unfortunately.

2142
03:07:56,711 --> 03:08:00,446
ERIC: Look, I just want to be close to the
action.

2143
03:08:00,446 --> 03:08:05,434
SAM: Cool. You guys kind of get the sense that the
longer you stay in here the more shit's going to

2144
03:08:05,434 --> 03:08:09,141
start happening. Anyone want to look at the door?

2145
03:08:09,141 --> 03:08:10,768
MARY: I would like to look at the door.

2146
03:08:10,768 --> 03:08:12,475
SAM: Okay, make an investigation check.

2147
03:08:12,475 --> 03:08:22,338
MARY: Oh, Tides of Chaos. That's better. Not
really. 18. 16!

2148
03:08:22,338 --> 03:08:31,492
SAM: Great. The door is not trapped. However, it
has a lock on it. A padlock. A curiously made

2149
03:08:31,492 --> 03:08:34,381
padlock. Where is it?

2150
03:08:34,381 --> 03:08:36,247
MARY: Are there numbers on the padlock?

2151
03:08:36,247 --> 03:08:41,613
SAM: There are numbers on the padlock, and you can
definitely sense that the padlock is magically

2152
03:08:41,613 --> 03:08:45,387
enchanted. And here it is!

2153
03:08:45,387 --> 03:08:47,641
LIAM: Oh shit!

2154
03:08:47,641 --> 03:08:49,802
MARY: What are the numbers on the padlock?

2155
03:08:49,802 --> 03:08:52,913
SAM: Who wants to look where?

2156
03:08:52,913 --> 03:08:54,547
LIAM: I'm looking at the ceiling.

2157
03:08:54,547 --> 03:08:56,077
SAM: Okay, you're looking at the ceiling.

2158
03:08:56,077 --> 03:08:57,886
LIAM: You said there are a lot of numbers up
there?

2159
03:08:57,886 --> 03:09:02,772
SAM: Tons of numbers. 29, seven, 65, 44, ten,
nine, four--

2160
03:09:02,772 --> 03:09:04,753
LIAM: And there's nothing different about any of
them?

2161
03:09:04,753 --> 03:09:10,013
SAM: Yes there are. They are all in different
colors. Some are red, some are green, some are

2162
03:09:10,013 --> 03:09:12,553
yellow, some are gold, some are orange.

2163
03:09:12,553 --> 03:09:18,676
MARY: Can you see if there are numbers, like four
numbers on the ceiling that are the same color?

2164
03:09:18,676 --> 03:09:20,142
LIAM: What color is the lock?

2165
03:09:20,142 --> 03:09:28,209
SAM: The lock is a basic gray. However, the slot
where you line up the correct numbers has a faint

2166
03:09:28,209 --> 03:09:34,706
color on it. The first two are orange. The second
two are green.

2167
03:09:34,706 --> 03:09:40,717
MARY: Okay, so I'm looking at the padlock. Because
you're up at the ceiling and I'm at the door,

2168
03:09:40,717 --> 03:09:45,336
right? Two orange, two green. What do you see up
top?

2169
03:09:45,336 --> 03:09:46,899
LIAM: An Irish flag.

2170
03:09:46,899 --> 03:09:52,268
MARY: All right. Which numbers are orange, which
numbers are green up on the ceiling?

2171
03:09:52,268 --> 03:09:58,144
SAM: Can you make a perception check? It's really
grimy up there.

2172
03:09:58,144 --> 03:10:03,061
LIAM: That is a 17 for me.

2173
03:10:03,061 --> 03:10:12,495
SAM: You definitely get a bead on the orange
numbers. Grab your pencil. There's many orange

2174
03:10:12,495 --> 03:10:22,442
numbers. They're all across the top of the
ceiling. They are six, one, eight, seven, two,

2175
03:10:22,442 --> 03:10:33,881
one, eight, two, four, nine, two, seven, one,
zero.

2176
03:10:33,881 --> 03:10:35,559
LIAM: You're a terrible person.

2177
03:10:35,559 --> 03:10:37,438
ASHLY: Can I use this item about this?

2178
03:10:37,438 --> 03:10:49,143
SAM: What is this item? Is it the earring? It can
tell you something about a person or a creature,

2179
03:10:49,143 --> 03:10:51,107
but not about a room.

2180
03:10:51,107 --> 03:10:52,498
ASHLY: Okay.

2181
03:10:52,498 --> 03:10:55,842
LIAM: Were those the orange numbers?

2182
03:10:55,842 --> 03:10:57,846
SAM: Those were the orange numbers.

2183
03:10:57,846 --> 03:11:00,233
MARY: What are the green numbers?

2184
03:11:00,233 --> 03:11:02,638
SAM: Make another perception check.

2185
03:11:02,638 --> 03:11:07,313
LIAM: I got a 14.

2186
03:11:07,313 --> 03:11:16,335
SAM: You can make out many of them. You get the
sense that if you got closer, somehow, you could

2187
03:11:16,335 --> 03:11:17,486
see more.

2188
03:11:17,486 --> 03:11:19,105
LIAM: How's the bard doing?

2189
03:11:19,105 --> 03:11:20,248
SAM: The bard?

2190
03:11:20,248 --> 03:11:21,139
LIAM: The bard!

2191
03:11:21,139 --> 03:11:22,540
SAM: I don't know how he's doing.

2192
03:11:22,540 --> 03:11:26,929
LIAM: I see him staring up, as well. How are you
doing, darling?

2193
03:11:26,929 --> 03:11:34,655
BRIAN: Fine. I'm wondering the endgame. I might go
back upstairs. But I want to see--

2194
03:11:34,655 --> 03:11:38,498
LIAM: Can you read the numbers on the ceiling?

2195
03:11:38,498 --> 03:11:45,686
BRIAN: Yeah, let me try. Oh wait, I did. Oh,
perception. I did investigation.

2196
03:11:45,686 --> 03:11:48,168
ASHLY: I rolled a 16 for perception.

2197
03:11:48,168 --> 03:11:55,391
SAM: Okay, so fine. While Kingston is fiddling
with his wingle--

2198
03:11:55,391 --> 03:11:56,757
BRIAN: 20.

2199
03:11:56,757 --> 03:12:03,450
SAM: 20?! You both see the green numbers very
clearly through the grime, dust, and cobwebs are

2200
03:12:03,450 --> 03:12:14,836
one, five, four, nine, eight, one, four, one,
three, two, zero.

2201
03:12:14,836 --> 03:12:16,286
LIAM: Keep going.

2202
03:12:16,286 --> 03:12:18,106
SAM: Now, I wait.

2203
03:12:18,106 --> 03:12:21,025
(laughter)

2204
03:12:21,025 --> 03:12:25,052
MARY: There are three less green numbers than
there are orange, and we've got two and two on the

2205
03:12:25,052 --> 03:12:34,425
padlock, two orange and two green. First two
numbers add to six and six. Motherfucker. I was

2206
03:12:34,425 --> 03:12:35,944
promised no math.

2207
03:12:35,944 --> 03:12:37,938
BRIAN: Promised no math.

2208
03:12:37,938 --> 03:12:44,675
ASHLY: There's four pillars in the room, but I
assume it's not relevant.

2209
03:12:44,675 --> 03:12:50,864
MARY: There's only three, right? Is the one pillar
still standing, or did it explode after hitting us?

2210
03:12:50,864 --> 03:12:52,710
LIAM: There's four pillars. One of them poofed out
poison.

2211
03:12:52,710 --> 03:12:54,821
ERIC: It was rough.

2212
03:12:54,821 --> 03:13:07,875
SAM: Sorry, guys. On the other side of the door,
you hear a low (snarling).

2213
03:13:07,875 --> 03:13:10,483
MARY: Oh, fuck. All right.

2214
03:13:10,483 --> 03:13:12,526
BRIAN: Did that sound like a cat to anyone else?

2215
03:13:12,526 --> 03:13:15,566
MARY: No, that sounded like a lizard or
something.

2216
03:13:15,566 --> 03:13:21,384
LIAM: And the lock looks like what over there?

2217
03:13:21,384 --> 03:13:23,129
MARY: It's like a big padlock.

2218
03:13:23,129 --> 03:13:28,872
BRIAN: Is there anything I can see on the lock?
Tell me about the lock.

2219
03:13:28,872 --> 03:13:30,750
SAM: Sure. Make an investigation check.

2220
03:13:30,750 --> 03:13:37,636
BRIAN: 18.

2221
03:13:37,636 --> 03:13:50,190
SAM: 18. That's great, yeah. It is specifically
designed in a way that-- it's a fragile thing. I

2222
03:13:50,190 --> 03:13:58,267
wouldn't try to hit it, because it has a trigger
mechanism that could fire something if struck.

2223
03:13:58,267 --> 03:14:00,328
It's got a pressure pad on it.

2224
03:14:00,328 --> 03:14:02,663
ASHLY: That's what I was going to do.

2225
03:14:02,663 --> 03:14:08,627
MARY: Can we see any of the numbers on the walls?
Is there anything else on the walls?

2226
03:14:08,627 --> 03:14:11,842
SAM: No numbers on the walls.

2227
03:14:11,842 --> 03:14:13,738
MARY: There's nothing on the floor.

2228
03:14:13,738 --> 03:14:15,757
ASHLY: How many snakes are on the pillars?

2229
03:14:15,757 --> 03:14:21,189
SAM: Let me do the math.

2230
03:14:21,189 --> 03:14:27,857
BRIAN: There's no numbers on the pillars, correct?
Just symbols?

2231
03:14:27,857 --> 03:14:30,895
LIAM: Sam's given us a MENSA challenge, and we all
die here.

2232
03:14:30,895 --> 03:14:39,646
MARY: We come back four years later. All right, so
the numbers again? Six, one, eight--

2233
03:14:39,646 --> 03:14:42,047
LIAM: Seven months without an episode break.

2234
03:14:42,047 --> 03:14:51,005
SAM: On one pillar, there's one snake. On the
next, there's three. On the next, there's two. On

2235
03:14:51,005 --> 03:14:52,695
the next, there's six.

2236
03:14:52,695 --> 03:14:54,459
ERIC: Say that again.

2237
03:14:54,459 --> 03:14:56,878
SAM: One, three, two, six.

2238
03:14:56,878 --> 03:15:00,389
BRIAN: That's on the pillars? Both, or all four?

2239
03:15:00,389 --> 03:15:03,990
SAM: This one has one, this one has three, this
one has two, this one has six.

2240
03:15:03,990 --> 03:15:13,818
BRIAN: Does the padlock have four numbers to open
it?

2241
03:15:13,818 --> 03:15:17,592
SAM: Four numbers. Two orange, two green.

2242
03:15:17,592 --> 03:15:20,925
BRIAN: How do we try them?

2243
03:15:20,925 --> 03:15:24,511
LIAM: The numbers on the pillars are not any
color, are they?

2244
03:15:24,511 --> 03:15:25,881
SAM: No.

2245
03:15:25,881 --> 03:15:28,837
ASHLY: I wonder if there's a penalty for trying
them. You could try it on this if you want to.

2246
03:15:28,837 --> 03:15:35,487
BRIAN: Could I try it on this? Okay. I'm just
going to fucking just because I know this fucker.

2247
03:15:35,487 --> 03:15:40,787
This is very hard to turn. It needs some WD-40,
Sam.

2248
03:15:40,787 --> 03:15:41,988
SAM: Sorry.

2249
03:15:41,988 --> 03:15:43,283
BRIAN: It's okay.

2250
03:15:43,283 --> 03:15:53,696
LIAM: You're so brave, Kingston. You should try as
many combinations as possible. Even if it burns

2251
03:15:53,696 --> 03:15:56,877
you somehow, you should keep trying.

2252
03:15:56,877 --> 03:15:59,654
BRIAN: Is it top to bottom or bottom to top to
open this?

2253
03:15:59,654 --> 03:16:01,128
SAM: Top to bottom.

2254
03:16:01,128 --> 03:16:05,572
BRIAN: Shit. Fuck. Someone do something else while
I do this.

2255
03:16:05,572 --> 03:16:14,660
ASHLY: While he's doing that, Sam, I'm going to
use this Earring of Piercing Knowledge and try to

2256
03:16:14,660 --> 03:16:17,350
find out if there are any weaknesses that Jayne
has.

2257
03:16:17,350 --> 03:16:24,880
SAM: She gets to know one fact about you. What she
has just used is a magical-- what is it called?

2258
03:16:24,880 --> 03:16:26,913
ASHLY: Earring of Piercing Knowledge.

2259
03:16:26,913 --> 03:16:31,817
SAM: You have to pierce your ear with it. Little
trickle of blood comes down, and now she knows one

2260
03:16:31,817 --> 03:16:35,122
fact about you, and she's chosen to know your
weaknesses.

2261
03:16:35,122 --> 03:16:39,918
LIAM: My weaknesses? I don't know what those are.
I could tell her many things.

2262
03:16:39,918 --> 03:16:44,373
SAM: Well, how about your-- let's see here.

2263
03:16:44,373 --> 03:16:50,679
LIAM: I will tell you lots of things in the
interest of not slowing down this episode. You

2264
03:16:50,679 --> 03:17:00,888
learn that I'm very weak and easily hit. You learn
that I am almost out of spells. And you have

2265
03:17:00,888 --> 03:17:08,827
learned that I am part of four generations of
women that have served the Chained Oblivion, which

2266
03:17:08,827 --> 03:17:15,337
is a god that everyone has heard of. And the
Chained Oblivion wants to destroy everything and I

2267
03:17:15,337 --> 03:17:21,313
am <i>fucking</i> crazy, just like my mother.

2268
03:17:21,313 --> 03:17:27,741
SAM: Make a perception check. Or investigation
check, whatever's higher.

2269
03:17:27,741 --> 03:17:32,900
MARY: Investigation. 14.

2270
03:17:32,900 --> 03:17:38,875
SAM: Upon looking at the numbers up top,
especially the orange ones, you start to realize

2271
03:17:38,875 --> 03:18:02,314
there's spaces between them. It's six, 18, seven,
21, eight, 24, nine, 27, ten. There are spaces in

2272
03:18:02,314 --> 03:18:04,708
between.

2273
03:18:04,708 --> 03:18:10,289
MARY: Those are the orange numbers.

2274
03:18:10,289 --> 03:18:12,662
SAM: Come on, guys, it's basic arithmetic.

2275
03:18:12,662 --> 03:18:18,717
ASHLY: We all had a little bit of Greep. I can't
even remember what it's called now.

2276
03:18:18,717 --> 03:18:20,517
MARY and ASHLY: Greep.

2277
03:18:20,517 --> 03:18:24,059
LIAM: What's after the eight? 24?

2278
03:18:24,059 --> 03:18:25,091
SAM: 24.

2279
03:18:25,091 --> 03:18:28,012
LIAM: Nine. The fuck is this, Sam?

2280
03:18:28,012 --> 03:18:29,681
ASHLY: I'm sure the chat's like, "It's this! It's
this!"

2281
03:18:29,681 --> 03:18:31,467
SAM: Oh, they are absolutely.

2282
03:18:31,467 --> 03:18:36,982
MARY: The chat's going, "Why can't you figure it
out?!"

2283
03:18:36,982 --> 03:18:40,692
BRIAN: Are we in any imminent danger?

2284
03:18:40,692 --> 03:18:51,377
SAM: As you say that, one of the pillars explodes.
These guys, Mary and Brian, you each take five

2285
03:18:51,377 --> 03:18:53,880
points of poison damage.

2286
03:18:53,880 --> 03:18:57,027
LIAM: I see a pattern, but I don't know what it
leads to.

2287
03:18:57,027 --> 03:18:59,558
ASHLY: 24, nine.

2288
03:18:59,558 --> 03:19:03,756
LIAM: Assholes.

2289
03:19:03,756 --> 03:19:05,676
ASHLY: What?

2290
03:19:05,676 --> 03:19:11,401
LIAM: Six is one-third of 18. Seven is one-third
of 21. Eight is one-third of 24. Nine is one-third

2291
03:19:11,401 --> 03:19:20,557
of 27. Ten. What's the ten? Ten is different than
the rest. I don't know if that means ten is

2292
03:19:20,557 --> 03:19:28,167
important, but it's different than the rest. Ten.

2293
03:19:28,167 --> 03:19:29,776
SAM: Say that all again, Liam?

2294
03:19:29,776 --> 03:19:36,805
LIAM: Six is one-third of 18. Seven is one-third
of 21. Eight is one-third of 24. Nine is one-third

2295
03:19:36,805 --> 03:19:40,444
of 27. Ten is one-third of-- there's nothing
there.

2296
03:19:40,444 --> 03:19:41,903
BRIAN: What is ten one-third of?

2297
03:19:41,903 --> 03:19:43,201
LIAM: 30.

2298
03:19:43,201 --> 03:19:48,454
BRIAN: So try-- well, there's four numbers,
though.

2299
03:19:48,454 --> 03:19:55,374
SAM: Those numbers that you're looking at are
orange. The first two slots on the lock are

2300
03:19:55,374 --> 03:19:56,512
orange.

2301
03:19:56,512 --> 03:19:58,850
BRIAN: So we need to find the two numbers that are
green now.

2302
03:19:58,850 --> 03:20:03,172
SAM: Make a perception check.

2303
03:20:03,172 --> 03:20:05,217
BRIAN: (groans) This isn't going well for me.

2304
03:20:05,217 --> 03:20:08,395
MARY: That's a five.

2305
03:20:08,395 --> 03:20:11,933
BRAIN: Perception? 18.

2306
03:20:11,933 --> 03:20:14,765
SAM: There are also spaces between these numbers.

2307
03:20:14,765 --> 03:20:16,643
BRIAN: Nope. 13. Your writing's too small.

2308
03:20:16,643 --> 03:20:18,012
SAM: One.

2309
03:20:18,012 --> 03:20:20,573
BRIAN: Is that an eight or a three?

2310
03:20:20,573 --> 03:20:23,111
LIAM: Why did you have to bring math into it, you
shit?

2311
03:20:23,111 --> 03:20:25,521
SAM: Yeah, I know, right? Four. I can't really
write upside down.

2312
03:20:25,521 --> 03:20:27,614
LIAM: You're doing it.

2313
03:20:27,614 --> 03:20:29,910
MARY and SAM: Nine. Eight.

2314
03:20:29,910 --> 03:20:31,488
MARY: 14.

2315
03:20:31,488 --> 03:20:34,001
SAM: Correct. 14.

2316
03:20:34,001 --> 03:20:36,234
MARY and SAM: 13, 20.

2317
03:20:36,234 --> 03:20:41,726
LIAM: Shit, what is that?

2318
03:20:41,726 --> 03:20:52,142
BRIAN: Well, there's even and odd numbers mixed up
in there.

2319
03:20:52,142 --> 03:21:07,182
MARY: One plus four is five. Four plus five is
nine. Eight plus six is 14? 13 plus seven is 20.

2320
03:21:07,182 --> 03:21:21,291
That's all I know. That's all the math I got. So
you got four, five, six, seven-- in a row. I don't

2321
03:21:21,291 --> 03:21:23,133
know what that is, Liam.

2322
03:21:23,133 --> 03:21:25,348
ASHLY: This is not my forte. I'm just pulling
shit--

2323
03:21:25,348 --> 03:21:34,219
MARY: So one plus four is five. Four plus five is
nine. Eight plus six is 14 and three plus seven is

2324
03:21:34,219 --> 03:21:36,871
20. I don't know what that means.

2325
03:21:36,871 --> 03:21:38,292
SAM: So what's next?

2326
03:21:38,292 --> 03:21:40,429
MARY and ASHLY: Oh!

2327
03:21:40,429 --> 03:21:46,062
LIAM: There are so many math majors watching right
now who are so mad at us.

2328
03:21:46,062 --> 03:21:50,944
MARY: Why are you so stupid, Rose? You're so
stupid.

2329
03:21:50,944 --> 03:21:53,652
LIAM: But Eric can sound like Chris Rock so--

2330
03:21:53,652 --> 03:21:55,511
SAM: Let's hear it, Eric.

2331
03:21:55,511 --> 03:22:01,334
ERIC: What's the deal with math? It wasn't a math
quiz show.

2332
03:22:01,334 --> 03:22:07,031
BRIAN: So 30. the first two numbers were the
last--

2333
03:22:07,031 --> 03:22:12,664
MARY: 14, 30! 20-- Wait. Okay, so you subtract one
from five, you get four. Subtract one from nine,

2334
03:22:12,664 --> 03:22:17,170
you get eight. Subtract one from 13, you get 20.
Subtract--

2335
03:22:17,170 --> 03:22:24,449
BRIAN: 19! So 3-0-1-9 or 1-9-3-0? Would be the two
options.

2336
03:22:24,449 --> 03:22:26,668
SAM: What you got, Mary?

2337
03:22:26,668 --> 03:22:29,698
MARY: 30 was the first and 19 was the second, but
that ain't right.

2338
03:22:29,698 --> 03:22:33,967
SAM: Look at the slot. Look at the slot on the
side. That's where the numbers go.

2339
03:22:33,967 --> 03:22:37,289
(laughter)

2340
03:22:37,289 --> 03:22:39,537
MARY: 30 and 19.

2341
03:22:39,537 --> 03:22:43,817
BRIAN: Or 1-9-3-0.

2342
03:22:43,817 --> 03:22:53,927
SAM: The lock is broken. The door is open; you are
in. This doesn't work!

2343
03:22:53,927 --> 03:22:55,934
BRIAN: You used Sharpie!

2344
03:22:55,934 --> 03:23:02,754
LIAM: Can we get a wet rag flown in? You are
getting beat up behind the studio tonight.

2345
03:23:02,754 --> 03:23:06,700
SAM: I love it. I'll do it over here; it's fine.

2346
03:23:06,700 --> 03:23:09,980
MARY: Does that work? Oh yeah. We just need a wet
rag. We need a wet rag, it's all good.

2347
03:23:09,980 --> 03:23:11,075
BRIAN: I got it!

2348
03:23:11,075 --> 03:23:18,370
MARY: You got it. You have no idea how difficult
math was. Math! No math, ever. Sam, you have a

2349
03:23:18,370 --> 03:23:24,585
brain for it. We don't. We've been drinking since
Tuesday.

2350
03:23:24,585 --> 03:23:28,374
SAM: Okay. Who's going in?

2351
03:23:28,374 --> 03:23:35,595
MARY: I am. Because I was right there by the
fucking door and in a celebratory moment of

2352
03:23:35,595 --> 03:23:39,735
getting the padlock open, I fall to my death.

2353
03:23:39,735 --> 03:23:42,565
SAM: Who's going in?

2354
03:23:42,565 --> 03:23:43,542
MARY: I'm going in.

2355
03:23:43,542 --> 03:23:48,634
SAM: You're going in. Where'd you go? Oh, over
here. Okay. Just you, right?

2356
03:23:48,634 --> 03:23:51,243
MARY: Well, Brian might go too because he was
right next to me.

2357
03:23:51,243 --> 03:23:54,545
LIAM: I mean, his character's dumb as fuck. I
think he might be going in.

2358
03:23:54,545 --> 03:23:57,816
MARY: Okay. Kingston LaForge!

2359
03:23:57,816 --> 03:24:04,408
SAM: Mary, this is what you see. The room is
similar in size and shape to the anteroom with a

2360
03:24:04,408 --> 03:24:09,374
coved ceiling held up by four spectacular carved
pillars. Two side pathways go to the right and

2361
03:24:09,374 --> 03:24:12,565
left of the room. I didn't remember that part, but
whatever.

2362
03:24:12,565 --> 03:24:23,896
On the far side of the room is a circular portal
glowing gold and emanating a low hum and even

2363
03:24:23,896 --> 03:24:30,570
though you are far from the warmth of the tavern
this room throbs with heat, as if you were walking

2364
03:24:30,570 --> 03:24:37,690
through a recently used oven. At the foot of the
portal, you see that man. Jesus, I lost him.

2365
03:24:37,690 --> 03:24:39,776
MARY: Where's that man?

2366
03:24:39,776 --> 03:24:50,327
SAM: I lost him. There he is. Boom. Holding a
struggling child. She screams in pain. There are

2367
03:24:50,327 --> 03:24:57,595
scratch marks above her eye and a steady trickle
of blood is pouring down half her face. The man

2368
03:24:57,595 --> 03:25:05,695
sees you enter and says, "It seems we all want
this youngling. I'm sorry, surface creatures, I

2369
03:25:05,695 --> 03:25:13,618
"saw her first. She's needed below." And you notice
that behind him a large, glowing portal opens up,

2370
03:25:13,618 --> 03:25:20,687
iris is open ever so slightly. It's pulsing, it's not
open enough for a person to walk in, but it's

2371
03:25:20,687 --> 03:25:23,074
getting close. What would you like to do?

2372
03:25:23,074 --> 03:25:31,630
MARY: I wanted to do a bonus action. I want to use
a couple of sorcery points to get another

2373
03:25:31,630 --> 03:25:42,863
1st-level spell because I lost one because of my
wild magic. Hello, everybody, there seems to be

2374
03:25:42,863 --> 03:25:50,137
our girl with the guy who's awful and he's-- come
here now! We need to help because otherwise he

2375
03:25:50,137 --> 03:25:52,320
will leave. There's a portal that's opening!

2376
03:25:52,320 --> 03:26:04,218
SAM: The man dashes to you. He gets right there
and he attacks. He rolled a one. He misses, but he

2377
03:26:04,218 --> 03:26:11,739
gets another attack. That's a 20. That hits.

2378
03:26:11,739 --> 03:26:13,170
MARY: Yeah.

2379
03:26:13,170 --> 03:26:21,741
SAM: Let me roll. Ooh. It's going to be bad.

2380
03:26:21,741 --> 03:26:30,715
ASHLY: He's still rolling!

2381
03:26:30,715 --> 03:26:33,910
SAM: Roll a dexterity saving throw.

2382
03:26:33,910 --> 03:26:42,087
MARY: I have good dexterity. 20.

2383
03:26:42,087 --> 03:26:49,164
SAM: Great. As he attacks, his human form drops
away and you see a salamander standing before you.

2384
03:26:49,164 --> 03:26:58,165
He's a large, ferocious lizard creature with a body of red
and orange scales, hard to see clearly because the

2385
03:26:58,165 --> 03:27:02,910
intense heat they throw off blurs the air around
them. His head and neck are more humanoid, with

2386
03:27:02,910 --> 03:27:07,865
smoke seeping out of his eyes and ears. He has a
streak of black that runs from one eye all the way

2387
03:27:07,865 --> 03:27:13,654
up and over his scalp. He's so hot, it's as if
he's made of fire. He holds a long black iron

2388
03:27:13,654 --> 03:27:23,210
spear in one claw and a ten-foot-long tail snaps behind
him. His slimy black tongue darts out, testing the

2389
03:27:23,210 --> 03:27:29,128
air, smelling you. You have just been dealt 15
points of fire damage.

2390
03:27:29,128 --> 03:27:32,373
MARY: Fire's my element. Does that mean it's
halved?

2391
03:27:32,373 --> 03:27:36,379
SAM: I don't know, man. You know you. Are you
resistant to fire?

2392
03:27:36,379 --> 03:27:37,724
MARY: I'm resistant to fire.

2393
03:27:37,724 --> 03:27:48,785
SAM: Then you only take seven points of fire
damage. You are not grappled. It is your turn, Mary.

2394
03:27:48,785 --> 03:27:53,586
MARY: The Ray of Frost seemed to work so well.

2395
03:27:53,586 --> 03:27:55,781
BRIAN: Did we roll initiative?

2396
03:27:55,781 --> 03:27:57,731
SAM: You're not in the fucking room.

2397
03:27:57,731 --> 03:27:59,016
MARY: It's just me and him.

2398
03:27:59,016 --> 03:28:01,840
BRIAN: Oh! I see. Sorry, I was getting you your Wet
Nap.

2399
03:28:01,840 --> 03:28:04,817
SAM: You guys are letting Mary take it.

2400
03:28:04,817 --> 03:28:11,168
MARY: It seems to be, Mr. Salamander, that you are
fire, fire, fire, so I'm going to come at you with

2401
03:28:11,168 --> 03:28:24,136
frost, frost, frost which is the only thing I
bloody have. Oh, wait. I'm going to use Chromatic

2402
03:28:24,136 --> 03:28:30,687
Orb of cold against salamander.

2403
03:28:30,687 --> 03:28:34,636
SAM: Go to that table.

2404
03:28:34,636 --> 03:28:41,884
MARY: I'm going to roll on the fucking table. (New
Jersey accent) Boom! All right, so I did just get

2405
03:28:41,884 --> 03:28:47,042
back from the Clam Broth House. They had some
beautiful trout. They had some beautiful fucking

2406
03:28:47,042 --> 03:28:51,654
trout that day. You know what I'm saying? They had
trout. It was gorgeous. It was beautiful.

2407
03:28:51,654 --> 03:28:53,954
LIAM: (New Jersey accent) You know what you got to
do? You got to fucking attack.

2408
03:28:53,954 --> 03:28:57,657
MARY: (New Jersey accent) Oh my god. What is that?
I think that's a fucking nine.

2409
03:28:57,657 --> 03:29:00,528
SAM: Nine. Oh shit.

2410
03:29:00,528 --> 03:29:03,128
LIAM: (New Jersey accent) I would like to use my
bonus action to drop a deuce.

2411
03:29:03,128 --> 03:29:07,470
MARY: (New Jersey accent) Isn't this beautiful?
Hey, motherfucking salamander! How you fucking

2412
03:29:07,470 --> 03:29:13,459
doing? You good today? You good? Your tongue
smells like shit, like a bad pastrami that I had

2413
03:29:13,459 --> 03:29:19,991
once back at the Millburn Deli. What I'm going to
tell you right now. I rolled a fucking nine.

2414
03:29:19,991 --> 03:29:23,177
You, 60 feet, are going to become poisoned.

2415
03:29:23,177 --> 03:29:29,833
SAM: Yeah. He is poisoned now. I really don't know
how poison works, but I assume

2416
03:29:29,833 --> 03:29:31,604
he takes poison damage.

2417
03:29:31,604 --> 03:29:34,183
LIAM: Disadvantage on his shit. I love high
fantasy, by the way.

2418
03:29:34,183 --> 03:29:39,381
MARY: (New Jersey accent) Millburn Deli, you're
going to like a sloppy joe. What you want to do is

2419
03:29:39,424 --> 03:29:44,099
get it with a little extra mayo, you got to go
extra sloppy with this shit. It'll counteract the

2420
03:29:44,099 --> 03:29:48,596
poison. Too bad we're not there right now. You're
going to fucking be poisoned. How you doing?

2421
03:29:48,596 --> 03:29:50,932
Boom, bitches!

2422
03:29:50,932 --> 03:29:55,708
SAM: He does not like that very much. He also
doesn't like the accent. He thinks it's uncouth.

2423
03:29:55,708 --> 03:30:03,358
I'm looking for poison. Bear with me. Okay,
poisoned creature has disadvantages on attack

2424
03:30:03,358 --> 03:30:06,984
rolls and ability checks. Holy shit! That's
amazing!

2425
03:30:06,984 --> 03:30:08,586
MARY: And he's poisoned for--

2426
03:30:08,586 --> 03:30:14,811
SAM: Well, it'll be more than an hour, so it's fine.
That's great. Well, he's about to attack you again--

2427
03:30:14,811 --> 03:30:16,794
MARY: For four hours, he's poisoned.

2428
03:30:16,794 --> 03:30:19,300
SAM: Great. Anyone else doing anything?

2429
03:30:19,300 --> 03:30:20,910
BRIAN: I would like to come into the room.

2430
03:30:20,910 --> 03:30:26,782
LIAM: I start pushing the cat, and start moving
towards the room.

2431
03:30:26,782 --> 03:30:30,210
MARY: Push the cat towards the room.

2432
03:30:30,210 --> 03:30:32,976
ASHLY: Oh great, it's a salamander now. Awesome.
Perfect.

2433
03:30:32,976 --> 03:30:37,678
LIAM: And I would like to try to get within ten
feet of the salamander, so behind the sorcerer.

2434
03:30:37,678 --> 03:30:41,186
SAM: All right, I'll say they flank them. You're
behind the sorcerer.

2435
03:30:41,186 --> 03:30:45,149
LIAM: And I would like to attack, if no one else
is going to jump on it.

2436
03:30:45,149 --> 03:30:49,255
SAM: Well, roll for initiative. Let's get an
initiative order.

2437
03:30:49,255 --> 03:30:51,193
LIAM: Yeah.

2438
03:30:51,193 --> 03:30:56,521
ASHLY: Eight.

2439
03:30:56,521 --> 03:31:00,853
SAM: Okay, 20 to 25?

2440
03:31:00,853 --> 03:31:03,288
MARY: Do you add anything to initiative?

2441
03:31:03,288 --> 03:31:08,199
SAM: Yes, it'll say on your character sheet.
You're plus three to initiative.

2442
03:31:08,199 --> 03:31:10,399
MARY: I am? 19.

2443
03:31:10,399 --> 03:31:13,400
SAM: Okay. Gryf.

2444
03:31:13,400 --> 03:31:15,558
LIAM: 17.

2445
03:31:15,558 --> 03:31:22,608
SAM: 17 Jayne, who else, 15 to 20? Anyone 15 to
20? Ten to 15?

2446
03:31:22,608 --> 03:31:24,085
BRIAN: 11.

2447
03:31:24,085 --> 03:31:25,652
SAM: Who else?

2448
03:31:25,652 --> 03:31:27,043
ERIC: Seven.

2449
03:31:27,043 --> 03:31:28,688
ASHLY: I'm an eight.

2450
03:31:28,688 --> 03:31:30,711
ERIC: Didn't roll high that time.

2451
03:31:30,711 --> 03:31:32,874
SAM: Frank is eight? No--

2452
03:31:32,874 --> 03:31:33,956
ASHLY: I'm eight.

2453
03:31:33,956 --> 03:31:43,464
SAM: Clothesline's eight. Frank's seven. Okay.
Salamander gets to go first. I don't know how to

2454
03:31:43,464 --> 03:31:45,029
do this for him.

2455
03:31:45,029 --> 03:31:47,866
MARY: It's okay. Just wing it, it's the secret to
adulthood.

2456
03:31:47,866 --> 03:31:49,818
LIAM: None of it's real.

2457
03:31:49,818 --> 03:31:58,364
SAM: All right, he's going to use his spear to
attack the bard to his right. That is a big old

2458
03:31:58,364 --> 03:31:59,456
22.

2459
03:31:59,456 --> 03:32:01,183
BRIAN: That hits.

2460
03:32:01,183 --> 03:32:03,031
SAM: Yeah, sorry, friend.

2461
03:32:03,031 --> 03:32:24,377
15 damage. You get pierced by this super
sharp spear, and it hurts real bad. And also, when

2462
03:32:24,377 --> 03:32:29,922
he withdraws it from your body, you suffer another
two points of fire damage, because it's

2463
03:32:29,922 --> 03:32:39,607
super-heated; it's almost molten iron, it's so
fucking hot. 15 plus two, and he gets to attack

2464
03:32:39,607 --> 03:32:48,293
again. He's going to go to the cat. Ooh, that's a
19 plus a lot. With his tail, he whips it around--

2465
03:32:48,293 --> 03:32:52,038
ASHLY: This might be the end of Clothesline.

2466
03:32:52,038 --> 03:32:56,126
SAM: That is a ten.

2467
03:32:56,126 --> 03:32:59,251
ASHLY: That is how many hit points I have.

2468
03:32:59,251 --> 03:33:00,916
SAM: You are unconscious.

2469
03:33:00,916 --> 03:33:02,134
ASHLY: See ya!

2470
03:33:02,134 --> 03:33:05,010
SAM: I don't know how all that works, but you're
unconscious.

2471
03:33:05,010 --> 03:33:08,791
LIAM: On her next turn, she makes a death saving
throw. So she's just unconscious. She could be

2472
03:33:08,791 --> 03:33:12,359
brought back, if anybody gives a fuck.

2473
03:33:12,359 --> 03:33:20,065
SAM: And on its movement, it will leave. You get
an attack of opportunity on it, both of you.

2474
03:33:20,065 --> 03:33:21,969
LIAM: Oh, it's running?

2475
03:33:21,969 --> 03:33:23,886
SAM: Yes, it's going (hisses).

2476
03:33:23,886 --> 03:33:27,881
LIAM: It's within ten feet of my range with the
whip, so I do, too.

2477
03:33:27,881 --> 03:33:33,407
SAM: All right, so make three attacks against this
thing. Kingston, you go first.

2478
03:33:33,407 --> 03:33:35,570
BRIAN: I would like to--

2479
03:33:35,570 --> 03:33:42,166
SAM: Are you a lore bard? I think you are. I think
you get to cast a spell on retreat.

2480
03:33:42,166 --> 03:33:46,331
BRIAN: I am, man. I will cast a--

2481
03:33:46,331 --> 03:33:48,413
SAM: If you want. Or you can use a fucking sword
or whatever.

2482
03:33:48,413 --> 03:33:52,325
BRIAN: I am going to have to cast Thunderwave at
this bitch.

2483
03:33:52,325 --> 03:33:57,921
SAM: Okay, go ahead. That is just a spell, right?
It's not ranged.

2484
03:33:57,921 --> 03:34:01,760
BRIAN: On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8
thunder damage.

2485
03:34:01,760 --> 03:34:03,329
SAM: Sure, what is the save?

2486
03:34:03,329 --> 03:34:05,658
BRIAN: The save is going to be a 14.

2487
03:34:05,658 --> 03:34:13,679
SAM: 14. Oh, he makes the save, but he takes half
damage, so instead of 2d8 it's 1d8?

2488
03:34:13,679 --> 03:34:14,978
BRIAN: Sure, man.

2489
03:34:14,978 --> 03:34:16,805
MARY: He's still poisoned. What does that mean?

2490
03:34:16,805 --> 03:34:18,338
LIAM: Disadvantage on everything.

2491
03:34:18,338 --> 03:34:22,372
SAM: Oh shit! I didn't roll disadvantage on those
attacks!

2492
03:34:22,372 --> 03:34:26,754
ASHLY: It's all right. I'm taking a cat nap; it's
fine.

2493
03:34:26,754 --> 03:34:30,304
BRIAN: That's not going to work. That's an eight.

2494
03:34:30,304 --> 03:34:33,854
SAM: Great. Actually, roll 2d8, and then take half
of that.

2495
03:34:33,854 --> 03:34:36,707
BRIAN: Okay. That's also an eight.

2496
03:34:36,707 --> 03:34:42,056
SAM: Great, so it's eight. Did he make his save?
He made his save, so he's not knocked prone, but

2497
03:34:42,056 --> 03:34:49,300
he does take eight points of damage. Good job,
guys! That's thunder damage, yeah? Okay. Great.

2498
03:34:49,300 --> 03:34:53,858
BRIAN: As a bonus action, can I cast a spell?

2499
03:34:53,858 --> 03:34:58,318
SAM: No. You get that on retreat. Mary, it's your
turn.

2500
03:34:58,318 --> 03:35:03,451
MARY: I get an attack, yeah? So I'm going to cast
a 1st-level Chromatic Orb.

2501
03:35:03,451 --> 03:35:07,824
SAM: You don't get to cast spells, I believe. You
can only do a melee hit if someone is running away

2502
03:35:07,824 --> 03:35:08,747
from you.

2503
03:35:08,747 --> 03:35:21,077
MARY: All right, then I'm going to pull out my
shortbow, and I'm going to (bowstring pings).

2504
03:35:21,077 --> 03:35:23,864
SAM: All right, roll an attack, plus whatever.

2505
03:35:23,864 --> 03:35:30,711
MARY: That was terrible. Just a straight attack?

2506
03:35:30,711 --> 03:35:37,435
SAM: Nope, it's d20 plus-- what is it? Is this a
finesse weapon? I don't know how bows work. Here,

2507
03:35:37,435 --> 03:35:39,112
it says plus three. Plus three.

2508
03:35:39,112 --> 03:35:41,642
MARY: Oh, plus three. Eight.

2509
03:35:41,642 --> 03:35:50,143
SAM: That goes wide, and it almost hits the girl.
Whip master? What've you got?

2510
03:35:50,143 --> 03:35:56,516
LIAM: With how things are going, and where I am
right now, I'm just going to cast Chill Touch,

2511
03:35:56,516 --> 03:35:58,659
which has a range of 120 feet.

2512
03:35:58,659 --> 03:36:00,758
SAM: Can you cast a spell on retreat?

2513
03:36:00,758 --> 03:36:01,831
LIAM: Retreat?

2514
03:36:01,831 --> 03:36:04,299
SAM: He's moving away from you; it's not your
turn.

2515
03:36:04,299 --> 03:36:05,815
LIAM: Oh, it's not my turn?

2516
03:36:05,815 --> 03:36:07,807
SAM: No, this is your attack of opportunity.

2517
03:36:07,807 --> 03:36:14,145
LIAM: Oh, if he ran, no, that would be the whip,
as soon as he ran. So that's just an attack. That

2518
03:36:14,145 --> 03:36:24,874
hits. That's an 18 plus some stuff. Okay, so
that's just 1d4 plus two, so that is a two plus

2519
03:36:24,874 --> 03:36:35,339
two is four, and I'm going to Channel Divinity and
fill that with death. So that will be a total of

2520
03:36:35,339 --> 03:36:40,469
more than four. One second, please.

2521
03:36:40,469 --> 03:36:41,771
SAM: Less than three?

2522
03:36:41,771 --> 03:36:49,765
LIAM: Hold on. That's an 18 damage, as it runs. 18
total, as it runs. It was a four from the whip,

2523
03:36:49,765 --> 03:36:59,910
and then 14 necrotic damage because I'm fucking
insane. And the Chained Oblivion's wrath fills

2524
03:36:59,910 --> 03:37:02,079
this fucking asshole.

2525
03:37:02,079 --> 03:37:08,986
SAM: Ooh, nice. He does not like that. It is now
Gryffin's turn; that was just his turn in retreat.

2526
03:37:08,986 --> 03:37:14,886
MARY: All right, I'm going to then cast Chromatic
Orb. Cold.

2527
03:37:14,886 --> 03:37:18,336
SAM: Okay, he's hiding behind a pillar; he has
half cover.

2528
03:37:18,336 --> 03:37:19,999
LIAM: Half cover, so at disadvantage.

2529
03:37:19,999 --> 03:37:21,202
MARY: Half cover.

2530
03:37:21,202 --> 03:37:23,935
SAM: You can move to see him.

2531
03:37:23,935 --> 03:37:26,720
LIAM: So you can go on a diagonal, and then you
can see him straight on.

2532
03:37:26,720 --> 03:37:37,178
MARY: I'm going to go on a diagonal. Diagon Alley.
And I am going to cast Chromatic Orb, with cold.

2533
03:37:37,178 --> 03:37:42,431
SAM: All right, spell DC? Right? Or is it a
ranged?

2534
03:37:42,431 --> 03:37:44,437
MARY: It's a hurl. I've got to hurl.

2535
03:37:44,437 --> 03:37:48,368
SAM: Ranged attack. Okay, so roll a d20 add six?

2536
03:37:48,368 --> 03:37:51,587
MARY: 24?

2537
03:37:51,587 --> 03:37:56,293
SAM: Yep, that hits, for sure. So now roll 3d8.

2538
03:37:56,293 --> 03:38:04,517
MARY: Right. 3d8, because I cast it at 1st-level.
What are d8s? Oh my god. I got you, bro. One, two,

2539
03:38:04,517 --> 03:38:10,180
I'll just-- Five and four is nine, plus seven--
16.

2540
03:38:10,180 --> 03:38:20,929
SAM: 16 points of damage, doubled to 32, is a big
hit. Great.

2541
03:38:20,929 --> 03:38:28,012
MARY: Feel the chill, motherfucker! Oh, another
salamander's coming.

2542
03:38:28,012 --> 03:38:29,658
SAM: Just then--

2543
03:38:29,658 --> 03:38:34,250
LIAM: Elizabeth Warren runs in!

2544
03:38:34,250 --> 03:38:35,804
MARY: What?!

2545
03:38:35,804 --> 03:38:46,815
SAM: I don't have her. Fuck it. Just then, an old
lady runs in the room. She has a hoof print on her

2546
03:38:46,815 --> 03:38:55,243
face. She's bloody, she is pissed off, her arm is
broken, she runs in and says, "Where's the bitch

2547
03:38:55,243 --> 03:39:03,170
"that ran me over with a horse?" Great. Jayne, it's
your turn.

2548
03:39:03,170 --> 03:39:06,772
(laughter)

2549
03:39:06,772 --> 03:39:10,660
LIAM: Well, it wasn't me. Shit.

2550
03:39:10,660 --> 03:39:13,306
MARY: So he's not bloodied, he's not nothing?

2551
03:39:13,306 --> 03:39:19,627
SAM: Oh, he's looking rough. Oh yeah, salamander
is looking rough.

2552
03:39:19,627 --> 03:39:29,937
LIAM: As a cantrip, I'm going to cast Chill Touch
on the salamander. Ranged spell attack. All right.

2553
03:39:29,937 --> 03:39:37,725
I want to use this one. Oh, that's terrible!
That is an eight.

2554
03:39:37,725 --> 03:39:40,067
SAM: Yeah, it hits the pillar in front of him.

2555
03:39:40,067 --> 03:39:42,614
LIAM: So a ghostly hand grabs the pillar and
nothing happens.

2556
03:39:42,614 --> 03:39:44,234
SAM: Absolutely. Ricochets off.

2557
03:39:44,234 --> 03:39:46,954
LIAM: That was an action.

2558
03:39:46,954 --> 03:39:55,677
SAM: Now you have to solve another lock riddle.
You can move; you can do a bonus action.

2559
03:39:55,677 --> 03:40:02,714
LIAM: Yes, I'm going to move. I'll move myself.
Five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30. I'm just going to be

2560
03:40:02,714 --> 03:40:03,986
right there.

2561
03:40:03,986 --> 03:40:05,352
SAM: Okay, Kingston, you're up. Do something.

2562
03:40:05,352 --> 03:40:10,925
BRIAN: For my action, I will cast Cure Wounds on
myself, because I am so low.

2563
03:40:10,925 --> 03:40:15,867
SAM: On yourself. There's a dead person next to
you, it's all good, but sure. Yeah, go ahead.

2564
03:40:15,867 --> 03:40:19,149
LIAM: To the home audience: choose the Luck feat.

2565
03:40:19,149 --> 03:40:24,969
BRIAN: You know what? Oh yeah, she is unconscious.
Where is she?

2566
03:40:24,969 --> 03:40:27,918
SAM: Here.

2567
03:40:27,918 --> 03:40:29,834
BRIAN: Oh yeah, okay. You know what?

2568
03:40:29,834 --> 03:40:33,539
LIAM: Whoa, she's unconscious?

2569
03:40:33,539 --> 03:40:38,006
SAM: Yeah, you can retroactively bonus action,
sure.

2570
03:40:38,006 --> 03:40:45,326
LIAM: I can? Oh, good. Instead, while everyone's
focused on the salamander, I'm going to loop the

2571
03:40:45,326 --> 03:40:49,419
whip around, and yank, and twist her neck.

2572
03:40:49,419 --> 03:40:54,027
SAM: In an instant, you feel the life drain out of
you.

2573
03:40:54,027 --> 03:40:56,254
LIAM: That's two death saves, is what that is.

2574
03:40:56,254 --> 03:41:02,125
ASHLY: I only clotheslined people so I could feel
human warmth!

2575
03:41:02,125 --> 03:41:06,172
SAM: Even though you are unconscious, you still
feel shitty.

2576
03:41:06,172 --> 03:41:10,497
BRIAN: Wait, but he does that before I can change
my mind about healing--

2577
03:41:10,497 --> 03:41:14,150
LIAM: And on her turn, she has to make a death
save. If she fails it, she's a goner.

2578
03:41:14,150 --> 03:41:17,753
SAM: Sure, but now it's Brian's turn, and he gets
to decide what to do.

2579
03:41:17,753 --> 03:41:21,860
BRIAN: All right, well now that it's my turn, and
we definitely haven't decided what I'm going to do

2580
03:41:21,860 --> 03:41:36,715
with it yet, I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on...
Clothesline. 1d8 plus my spellcasting modifier.

2581
03:41:36,715 --> 03:41:39,314
SAM: You're using this as a bonus action?

2582
03:41:39,314 --> 03:41:43,404
BRIAN: No, my regular-ass action. Because I'm
fine.

2583
03:41:43,404 --> 03:41:46,764
SAM: It is a bonus action. You can also use a real
spell.

2584
03:41:46,764 --> 03:41:49,217
BRIAN: Wait, I just asked that earlier, and you
said no!

2585
03:41:49,217 --> 03:41:50,872
SAM: What are you talking about?

2586
03:41:50,872 --> 03:41:53,134
BRIAN: I asked if I could use a spell on my bonus
action, and you said no.

2587
03:41:53,134 --> 03:41:54,334
SAM: You said if you could use a cantrip.

2588
03:41:54,334 --> 03:41:55,913
BRIAN: I asked if I could use a cantrip?

2589
03:41:55,913 --> 03:41:57,887
SAM: That's a level one spell.

2590
03:41:57,887 --> 03:42:07,465
BRIAN: I don't have bonus actions as a wizard,
yet, so I'm confused. Okay, so for my action, I

2591
03:42:07,465 --> 03:42:15,803
will-- fuck. I'm going to do Vicious Mockery at
Frank Grillo.

2592
03:42:15,803 --> 03:42:17,373
SAM: Okay, go ahead.

2593
03:42:17,373 --> 03:42:21,484
LIAM: At who? Frank Grillo?

2594
03:42:21,484 --> 03:42:22,909
MARY: Who's Frank Grillo?

2595
03:42:22,909 --> 03:42:26,707
ERIC: I'm Frank Grillo.

2596
03:42:26,707 --> 03:42:32,475
BRIAN: That's 1d4 of psychic damage.

2597
03:42:32,475 --> 03:42:34,830
SAM: Sure, I've got to make a save.

2598
03:42:34,830 --> 03:42:37,706
BRIAN: Yeah, you have to make a fucking wisdom
save.

2599
03:42:37,706 --> 03:42:39,125
SAM: Wisdom save?

2600
03:42:39,125 --> 03:42:40,988
BRIAN: Yes, wisdom save.

2601
03:42:40,988 --> 03:42:47,551
SAM: Okay. I do not make it. 2d8. Go ahead.

2602
03:42:47,551 --> 03:42:49,667
BRIAN: Oh, yeah? Oh.

2603
03:42:49,667 --> 03:42:51,731
SAM: Wait, what is this? This is Vicious Mockery.

2604
03:42:51,731 --> 03:43:01,477
BRIAN: It's 1d4. I was gone for a minute, but I'm
back now. Sit the fuck back down. Seem like

2605
03:43:01,477 --> 03:43:03,626
everyday nowaday Hollywood-- Three.

2606
03:43:03,626 --> 03:43:09,413
SAM: Okay. Of psychic damage? And he has
disadvantage on his next attack, which he already

2607
03:43:09,413 --> 03:43:10,575
had. So great.

2608
03:43:10,575 --> 03:43:12,300
BRIAN: I'mma show these motherfuckers how to act
now.

2609
03:43:12,300 --> 03:43:15,933
SAM: Okay, you also get your bonus action, which
you can use to heal--

2610
03:43:15,933 --> 03:43:18,758
BRIAN: My bonus action will be to cure my
beloved.

2611
03:43:18,758 --> 03:43:20,678
SAM: How would you like to talk to her to cure
her?

2612
03:43:20,678 --> 03:43:23,861
BRIAN: I have to talk to her to cure her?

2613
03:43:23,861 --> 03:43:26,491
SAM: It's Healing Word, you have to say a word of
healing.

2614
03:43:26,491 --> 03:43:28,644
BRAIN: Oh, Cure Wounds?

2615
03:43:28,644 --> 03:43:34,493
SAM: Cure Wounds? Okay, that is a real spell; that
takes an action. It's okay, just do Healing Word, bud.

2616
03:43:34,493 --> 03:43:43,277
BRIAN: Oh fuck, yeah. Okay. Healing Word is--

2617
03:43:43,277 --> 03:43:45,946
SAM: 1d4 plus something, four, maybe?

2618
03:43:45,946 --> 03:43:57,491
BRIAN: (singing) I love Greep. I love cat people.
What the hell am I doing here? That's a two.

2619
03:43:57,491 --> 03:44:00,306
SAM: Great, you've got two hit points; you're
alive.

2620
03:44:00,306 --> 03:44:04,780
BRIAN: Sorry it's not more, but hopefully it's
enough to get us maybe a date, later?

2621
03:44:04,780 --> 03:44:14,856
SAM: Kingston just saved you. Clothesline, you are
alive. It is your turn. She's prone.

2622
03:44:14,856 --> 03:44:16,716
ASHLY: I'm prone? What can I do, then?

2623
03:44:16,716 --> 03:44:19,139
LIAM: You can get up. It's half your movement, but
you can fuck me up, still.

2624
03:44:19,139 --> 03:44:25,442
ASHLY: I can get up? Then I am going to
clothesline that motherfucker there.

2625
03:44:25,442 --> 03:44:27,645
SAM: Great. Roll an attack?

2626
03:44:27,645 --> 03:44:29,858
LIAM: I haven't lost a hit point this entire
game.

2627
03:44:29,858 --> 03:44:31,093
ASHLY: Natural 20!

2628
03:44:31,093 --> 03:44:33,454
(cheering)

2629
03:44:33,454 --> 03:44:37,478
SAM: That certainly hits. Roll 1d4 plus four?

2630
03:44:37,478 --> 03:44:42,392
ASHLY: Come on, baby. Three plus four is seven.

2631
03:44:42,392 --> 03:44:43,925
SAM: Double it. 14.

2632
03:44:43,925 --> 03:44:48,117
LIAM: No, the dice are doubled.

2633
03:44:48,117 --> 03:44:53,000
SAM: It's ten. It's ten. And you're not knocked
prone.

2634
03:44:53,000 --> 03:44:54,760
ASHLY: Did I take my second action surge?

2635
03:44:54,760 --> 03:44:56,129
SAM: No. Do it.

2636
03:44:56,129 --> 03:45:00,624
ASHLY: I'm going to clothesline you again! A
natural 20!

2637
03:45:00,624 --> 03:45:02,194
(cheering)

2638
03:45:02,194 --> 03:45:06,067
LIAM: What the fuck is that? Get out of this
building!

2639
03:45:06,067 --> 03:45:12,478
MARY: Buy this die. You can sell this die for
millions.

2640
03:45:12,478 --> 03:45:17,821
SAM: So Clothesline turns around, delivers a
right-armed clothesline to you. It hurts. She

2641
03:45:17,821 --> 03:45:22,370
kisses her bicep, uses the other arm. Left-arm
clothesline on you.

2642
03:45:22,370 --> 03:45:24,927
ASHLY: Give me a four, baby, give me a four. A
four!

2643
03:45:24,927 --> 03:45:26,070
SAM: A four!

2644
03:45:26,070 --> 03:45:27,589
ASHLY: And you're prone, motherfucker.

2645
03:45:27,589 --> 03:45:33,174
LIAM: Do the Leonidas handshake with me; that was
amazing.

2646
03:45:33,174 --> 03:45:37,477
SAM: That's 22 total points of damage, and you are
prone. The double clothesline.

2647
03:45:37,477 --> 03:45:39,468
LIAM: In addition to the last attack?

2648
03:45:39,468 --> 03:45:41,492
SAM: No, that's total. 22 total.

2649
03:45:41,492 --> 03:45:46,747
MARY: So what did you say right before she rolled?
You had taken no hit points? Say it again out loud.

2650
03:45:46,747 --> 03:45:48,809
ASHLY: Yeah, say it, please.

2651
03:45:48,809 --> 03:45:51,090
LIAM: No hit points, to all the hit points.

2652
03:45:51,090 --> 03:45:52,474
ASHLY: All of your hit points?

2653
03:45:52,474 --> 03:45:53,652
LIAM: No, not all.

2654
03:45:53,652 --> 03:45:58,745
ASHLY: Damn it. Wait, he gave me the 1d6--

2655
03:45:58,745 --> 03:46:07,826
SAM: Oh, that wouldn't be useful here, anyway. Do
that on a save. Eric, it is your turn. What do you

2656
03:46:07,826 --> 03:46:09,366
want to do?

2657
03:46:09,366 --> 03:46:17,758
ERIC: I mean, my knowledge of his association with
Chain of Oblivion.

2658
03:46:17,758 --> 03:46:26,059
SAM: Sure. When Jayne falls, you see very clearly
the symbol of the Chained Oblivion, and the

2659
03:46:26,059 --> 03:46:33,392
tattoos under her skin, clearly exposed now that
she's lying on the floor, white skin revealed.

2660
03:46:33,392 --> 03:46:42,110
She's definitely a servant of the Chained
Oblivion, whom you are sworn to kill.

2661
03:46:42,110 --> 03:46:52,869
ERIC: You know, it's my first time playing. But it
clearly states that you raided my village, and I

2662
03:46:52,869 --> 03:47:01,948
have sworn an oath to seek revenge on the cult, or
anyone associated with the cult of the Chained

2663
03:47:01,948 --> 03:47:10,530
Oblivion, so I would like to continue the attack
on Jayne.

2664
03:47:10,530 --> 03:47:13,227
LIAM: Only the best people are in the cult. You'd
be surprised.

2665
03:47:13,227 --> 03:47:16,917
ERIC: And I choose to do so with my maul.

2666
03:47:16,917 --> 03:47:21,539
SAM: Yes, please. Two-handed strike, go for it.
Roll for an attack.

2667
03:47:21,539 --> 03:47:29,528
LIAM: Not great, but hold on. Five plus six is 11.
I'm sorry, that does not hit. I'm so sorry.

2668
03:47:29,528 --> 03:47:32,309
ERIC: Man, I just revealed my hand.

2669
03:47:32,309 --> 03:47:37,970
SAM: Hold on, let me just look at you, see if you
have any extra things--

2670
03:47:37,970 --> 03:47:42,499
BRIAN: My ex-wife said you didn't know how to use
them.

2671
03:47:42,499 --> 03:47:47,192
MARY: Apparently, he knew how to use other
things.

2672
03:47:47,192 --> 03:47:49,665
SAM: Okay, you know what?

2673
03:47:49,665 --> 03:47:51,400
BRIAN: His dwarven hammer, perhaps.

2674
03:47:51,400 --> 03:47:53,631
SAM: If you wanted to--

2675
03:47:53,631 --> 03:48:00,048
LIAM: This salamander is like, "Look at these
assholes fighting amongst themselves!"

2676
03:48:00,048 --> 03:48:05,533
SAM: I'm just going to suggest to you that we're
late in the night; you might have used Vow of

2677
03:48:05,533 --> 03:48:10,965
Enmity as a bonus action to give you an advantage
on this attack, so you could roll again.

2678
03:48:10,965 --> 03:48:14,021
ERIC: I did write it down and circle it.

2679
03:48:14,021 --> 03:48:19,442
LIAM: So you could cast it on me, which you would
do, as a paladin who hates the Chained Oblivion.

2680
03:48:19,442 --> 03:48:21,285
So roll again; if you do better, you hit me.

2681
03:48:21,285 --> 03:48:25,206
ERIC: I will cast my bowels of Enmity.

2682
03:48:25,206 --> 03:48:32,605
SAM: You've shat on the floor. It's an angry
poop.

2683
03:48:32,605 --> 03:48:40,332
ERIC: I would like to use my Imodium AD and come
right in. Five again!

2684
03:48:40,332 --> 03:48:46,575
MARY: It was meant to be. You convinced him to use
it, is the thing.

2685
03:48:46,575 --> 03:48:52,966
SAM: Blinded by your hatred of the Chained
Oblivion, you can't seem to make contact with your

2686
03:48:52,966 --> 03:49:01,100
maul, and instead you swipe to the left, hitting
the old lady in the face. Killing her. Again.

2687
03:49:01,100 --> 03:49:03,455
ERIC: Problem solved, guys.

2688
03:49:03,455 --> 03:49:05,920
MARY: Sorry, random newcomer.

2689
03:49:05,920 --> 03:49:13,761
SAM: That's Frank's turn. We're onto the
salamander, who is going to use half his movement

2690
03:49:13,761 --> 03:49:19,868
to attack Gryffin. Rolls an eight plus seven. 15?

2691
03:49:19,868 --> 03:49:21,453
MARY: Nope.

2692
03:49:21,453 --> 03:49:35,470
SAM: Okay. Second attack. That hits, that's a
20-something. Okay. Eight plus four. 12. Oh boy.

2693
03:49:35,470 --> 03:49:45,992
Plus seven. Okay, so it's 12 bludgeoning damage
and seven fire damage.

2694
03:49:45,992 --> 03:49:47,960
MARY: The fire is halved.

2695
03:49:47,960 --> 03:49:58,529
SAM: Okay, so 12 plus two then, right? 14? Roll a
dexterity saving throw to see if you're grappled.

2696
03:49:58,529 --> 03:50:06,681
You know what, it doesn't matter; he's not going
to grapple you. He's moving. The portal is fully

2697
03:50:06,681 --> 03:50:10,077
open. He grabs Holly, he puts one leg in. That's
as far as he can get.

2698
03:50:10,077 --> 03:50:12,097
LIAM: He's got no legs.

2699
03:50:12,097 --> 03:50:22,243
SAM: I'm sorry. It's one penis in. He walks on 100
penises. He's like a centipede-- he's like a

2700
03:50:22,243 --> 03:50:30,464
centipene. It is Gryffin's turn.

2701
03:50:30,464 --> 03:50:36,896
MARY: I take out my Wand of Entanglement, and I
whip it at motherfucking salamander.

2702
03:50:36,896 --> 03:50:38,556
SAM: I don't know what that is. What does he do?

2703
03:50:38,556 --> 03:50:40,418
MARY: I entangle him.

2704
03:50:40,418 --> 03:50:41,522
SAM: Automatically?

2705
03:50:41,522 --> 03:50:50,130
MARY: Yeah, I don't know. It's fun, isn't it?

2706
03:50:50,130 --> 03:50:51,914
SAM: It's the Entangle spell.

2707
03:50:51,914 --> 03:50:55,520
MARY: It's the Entangle spell, and I have a wand
that does it--

2708
03:50:55,520 --> 03:50:58,953
SAM: I might have written this on your card. Hold
on, let me look.

2709
03:50:58,953 --> 03:51:01,254
MARY: I hope so, because it's going to take me a
second to find it.

2710
03:51:01,254 --> 03:51:15,312
SAM: Here it is. 20 foot square versus strength.
14 save. He makes his save.

2711
03:51:15,312 --> 03:51:18,794
You still get a bonus action.

2712
03:51:18,794 --> 03:51:25,133
MARY: Okay, well my bonus would be-- are you
allowing the cantrips as a bonus?

2713
03:51:25,133 --> 03:51:26,649
SAM: Sure, man. Go for it.

2714
03:51:26,649 --> 03:51:28,407
MARY: Ray of Frost.

2715
03:51:28,407 --> 03:51:29,554
SAM: Yep, do it.

2716
03:51:29,554 --> 03:51:32,907
BRIAN: Maybe a little dinner and some laser
pointer?

2717
03:51:32,907 --> 03:51:34,358
ASHLY: Okay, don't push it.

2718
03:51:34,358 --> 03:51:36,925
MARY: 22.

2719
03:51:36,925 --> 03:51:42,272
SAM: He looks back at you and says, "Fuck you, you
can't catch me," and you hit him square in the

2720
03:51:42,272 --> 03:51:45,169
face. Roll for damage.

2721
03:51:45,169 --> 03:51:47,080
MARY: Yes, I fucking can.

2722
03:51:47,080 --> 03:51:48,710
SAM: 1d8 cold.

2723
03:51:48,710 --> 03:51:52,680
MARY: 1d8 cold. Five.

2724
03:51:52,680 --> 03:52:00,157
SAM: Five. He has ten hit points left, but cold
damage is doubled. How do you want to--

2725
03:52:00,157 --> 03:52:02,247
(cheering)

2726
03:52:02,247 --> 03:52:07,381
SAM: How do you want to kill this?

2727
03:52:07,381 --> 03:52:15,939
MARY: From my hand, comes a spear that hits him
square in the jaw, as he-- what did he say?

2728
03:52:15,939 --> 03:52:20,359
SAM: "Fuck you. You can't fucking catch me!"

2729
03:52:20,359 --> 03:52:26,806
MARY: And at that moment, it goes (impact). Well,
you figure it out.

2730
03:52:26,806 --> 03:52:33,136
SAM: Yeah, not only does it bisect his tongue, it
splits his head open all the way back to the back

2731
03:52:33,136 --> 03:52:39,157
of his neck, protruding out the back. When it goes
behind him, your cold spear-- it's a cold spear?

2732
03:52:39,157 --> 03:52:46,124
Enters the portal and instantly melts, because
it's so fucking hot in there. His head splits in

2733
03:52:46,124 --> 03:52:53,868
half, and he falls to the side, next to a frazzled
and crazed Holly, who is looking at this with open

2734
03:52:53,868 --> 03:52:55,118
eyes; she hasn't said a word.

2735
03:52:55,118 --> 03:52:57,020
BRIAN: Holly's going to need some therapy after
this.

2736
03:52:57,020 --> 03:53:02,578
MARY: Holly! Holly, we're here, don't worry, it's
all right. Move towards me. Get away from that thing.

2737
03:53:02,578 --> 03:53:11,473
LIAM: Wait, before we move forward, I know that
I'm after Gryffin. Yes. So because that is so, I

2738
03:53:11,473 --> 03:53:18,055
would like to attack the tabaxi with my whip,
now.

2739
03:53:18,055 --> 03:53:21,441
MARY: He's just got a thing for your love.

2740
03:53:21,441 --> 03:53:27,243
BRIAN: She's not doing anything to her that I
think is worthy of this.

2741
03:53:27,243 --> 03:53:30,179
LIAM: That is a 13 to hit?

2742
03:53:30,179 --> 03:53:32,815
ASHLY: 18 armor class, my friend.

2743
03:53:32,815 --> 03:53:44,249
LIAM: Fuck. Okay, I'm going to start to run. One,
two, three, four, five, six. Okay?

2744
03:53:44,249 --> 03:53:50,867
SAM: Okay, good. As the defeated salamander lies
motionless on the floor, there's a brief moment of

2745
03:53:50,867 --> 03:53:56,052
calm. You look around the room. Just moments ago,
you were strangers, but at the Ass Sailor,

2746
03:53:56,052 --> 03:54:02,992
anything is possible. The girl, Holly, finally
speaks. She steps forward and says, "Thank you,

2747
03:54:02,992 --> 03:54:09,079
"kind souls. I know not why you have rescued me,
but my people will be grateful, and you will be

2748
03:54:09,079 --> 03:54:15,342
"rewarded handsomely for your goodness. I can sense
that many of you do not trust each other."

2749
03:54:15,342 --> 03:54:17,597
ASHLY: Can I run after Liam?

2750
03:54:17,597 --> 03:54:22,258
LIAM: Six seconds have passed. One, two, three,
four, five, six.

2751
03:54:22,258 --> 03:54:25,797
SAM: "Please, don't leave, Clothesline. I'm not
done with my speech."

2752
03:54:25,797 --> 03:54:32,976
MARY: Jayne's running like Tom fucking Cruise.

2753
03:54:32,976 --> 03:54:36,137
SAM: She casts Hold Person on you.

2754
03:54:36,137 --> 03:54:37,753
ASHLY: Goddamn it.

2755
03:54:37,753 --> 03:54:45,654
SAM: On Clothesline. "I ask you, as one caring
creature to another, to put aside your differences

2756
03:54:45,654 --> 03:54:55,568
"and marvel in what you have accomplished here
together, as more than strangers, as friends. I

2757
03:54:55,568 --> 03:55:01,426
"must leave now, but you will see me again. And as
I leave you, I suggest you remember these words of

2758
03:55:01,426 --> 03:55:09,323
"advice: snitches get stitches. If you talk to the
police, try not to tell them too much, for all our sakes."

2759
03:55:09,323 --> 03:55:17,279
And with that, she poof, disappears. And suddenly,
in the back of the room, holding Jayne in his

2760
03:55:17,279 --> 03:55:27,433
arms, a gruff man constable and ten armed guards
beside him enter the room and say, "Freeze! All of

2761
03:55:27,433 --> 03:55:37,312
"you, hold it right there, you fuckwads. We caught
your little albino freak trying to run away. You

2762
03:55:37,312 --> 03:55:42,568
"five made quite the fucking mess upstairs, you
know that? Dead hookers, burned up old ladies,

2763
03:55:42,568 --> 03:55:49,014
"some guy talking about a fucking rat. It's going
to take days to mop this shit up, and you're going

2764
03:55:49,014 --> 03:55:53,815
"to help me figure out what the shit happened.
That's right: you're all under arrest. Boys, bring

2765
03:55:53,815 --> 03:55:59,164
"them down to the station; I'm going to interrogate
every single one of them until they talk, and talk

2766
03:55:59,164 --> 03:56:00,423
"they will."

2767
03:56:00,423 --> 03:56:04,912
As the police take you into custody, marching you
back up through the ruined bar, you notice

2768
03:56:04,912 --> 03:56:13,232
Valerie, the bartender, frazzled, removing her
apron, letting out a big sigh, mounting her horse

2769
03:56:13,232 --> 03:56:16,878
for the long, cold ride home. The end.

2770
03:56:16,878 --> 03:56:21,917
(cheering)

2771
03:56:21,917 --> 03:56:23,675
SAM: I'm spent.

2772
03:56:23,675 --> 03:56:27,041
LIAM: Takes a lot of concentration, yeah?

2773
03:56:27,041 --> 03:56:28,207
SAM: Oh my god.

2774
03:56:28,207 --> 03:56:30,330
MARY: Sam, that was amazing!

2775
03:56:30,330 --> 03:56:33,760
SAM: That's hard, dudes.

2776
03:56:33,760 --> 03:56:37,372
MARY: I loved the interrogation mid-way through.
That was so cool.

2777
03:56:37,372 --> 03:56:41,183
LIAM: Ashly, we all lived, so it's like we're all
winners, right?

2778
03:56:41,183 --> 03:56:45,014
ASHLY: Is that really what it's like, Liam? Is
that what it's like?

2779
03:56:45,014 --> 03:56:47,533
BRIAN: How many did you have left, two? I had
seven.

2780
03:56:47,533 --> 03:56:49,505
MARY: I was 12.

2781
03:56:49,505 --> 03:56:53,258
LIAM: I kept trying to take away those two hit
points for so long!

2782
03:56:53,258 --> 03:56:55,683
MARY: Eric's like, "I got full strength, I got
full power."

2783
03:56:55,683 --> 03:56:58,596
ERIC: Play neutral, that's how I play it. In any
game.

2784
03:56:58,596 --> 03:57:04,677
SAM: What items did you find and not use? The
Snuff Box of Jump?

2785
03:57:04,677 --> 03:57:08,209
MARY: The Snuff Box of Jump was pretty cool.

2786
03:57:08,209 --> 03:57:15,952
SAM: Yeah, you snort coke and get Jump. You also
didn't find the super weird porno book or the jug

2787
03:57:15,952 --> 03:57:17,505
of nasty grease.

2788
03:57:17,505 --> 03:57:19,943
MARY: When would I have used the Scroll of Feather
Fall, though?

2789
03:57:19,943 --> 03:57:22,205
SAM: Oh, that was something that you guys didn't
go to.

2790
03:57:22,205 --> 03:57:27,174
LIAM: If I could have rolled a critical hit one
time, like you did three times, I could have

2791
03:57:27,174 --> 03:57:30,029
one-hit killed any of you. Any of you.

2792
03:57:30,029 --> 03:57:34,523
SAM: Yeah, he has this special whip that if people
get weak enough, you die.

2793
03:57:34,523 --> 03:57:40,001
MARY: So I thought it was like a Finger of Death,
I wasn't sure; it seemed to be very Fingery of Deathy.

2794
03:57:40,001 --> 03:57:42,250
SAM: Sort of. Oh, it was fingery all right.

2795
03:57:42,250 --> 03:57:44,253
ERIC: Who was Garello?

2796
03:57:44,253 --> 03:57:49,232
SAM: Oh, Garello was a.k.a. Sal the Salamander.

2797
03:57:49,232 --> 03:57:52,743
MARY: Yes! I killed Garello!

2798
03:57:52,743 --> 03:57:57,858
SAM: You were being paid to transport this girl
here to them, you don't know who was paying him.

2799
03:57:57,858 --> 03:58:01,043
ERIC: So it would've been bad if I had found
Garello.

2800
03:58:01,043 --> 03:58:05,038
SAM: Yes, it would've been bad if you'd found him.
He would've taken the girl, and taken her back to

2801
03:58:05,038 --> 03:58:09,064
his land to do some untold badness to her.

2802
03:58:09,064 --> 03:58:11,444
BRIAN: Man, magic did not work well tonight.

2803
03:58:11,444 --> 03:58:14,573
MARY: Magic, it didn't work in the first half. It
worked better in the basement than it did

2804
03:58:14,573 --> 03:58:20,001
upstairs. Once I'd figured out-- the first thing
that I hit him with was frost, and that was

2805
03:58:20,001 --> 03:58:27,226
upstairs, and I was like oh, he totally, English
football (squeals). And I was like, oh, okay.

2806
03:58:27,226 --> 03:58:34,276
SAM: Guys, this was so much fun. I hope it was fun
for you. A big silent hand for Brian Foster, Mary

2807
03:58:34,276 --> 03:58:39,324
Elizabeth McGlynn, Ashly Burch, Liam O'Brien, and
Eric Bauza.

2808
03:58:39,324 --> 03:58:41,078
ASHLY: And to Sam Riegel!

2809
03:58:41,078 --> 03:58:48,351
SAM: Thanks, guys. I'm going to go home and sleep,
and then I'll see you in the morning.

2810
03:58:48,351 --> 03:58:55,972
LIAM: Thank you to Matthew Mercer, who does this
week after week after week.

2811
03:58:55,972 --> 03:58:57,901
MARY: Eric, how do you feel? First time playing.

2812
03:58:57,901 --> 03:59:03,991
ERIC: Pretty good, I called so many of my friends
that actually do play for advice, and one of them,

2813
03:59:03,991 --> 03:59:08,076
Graham Lunam, who I said I'd call out-- because
he's a huge fan, he's a Canadian, watching

2814
03:59:08,076 --> 03:59:12,804
probably right now-- he's been texting me, saying
I've been doing a good job. But I would totally

2815
03:59:12,804 --> 03:59:16,315
come back again, but thank you for having me.

2816
03:59:16,315 --> 03:59:18,582
SAM: No, thank you for getting dressed up for the
occasion.

2817
03:59:18,582 --> 03:59:28,886
ERIC: I kept the AC going in the Uber, but of
course I've got to cover my Olive Garden shift.

2818
03:59:28,886 --> 03:59:32,174
BRIAN: I'd like to thank my attorney, Eric Bauza,
for coming tonight to play with us.

2819
03:59:32,174 --> 03:59:39,358
SAM: Have a good night, everyone. Check us out on
Tuesday for Talks Machina; we'll be talking about

2820
03:59:39,358 --> 03:59:46,924
the game and stuff. Congrats again to
CholieAmenthys for winning the thing, and-- what

2821
03:59:46,924 --> 03:59:48,077
do I say now?

2822
03:59:48,077 --> 03:59:49,348
MARY: Yay, you say yay, Sam.

2823
03:59:49,348 --> 03:59:55,875
SAM: And now, is it Thursday yet? Goodnight,
everyone.

2824
03:59:55,875 --> 04:06:48,361
