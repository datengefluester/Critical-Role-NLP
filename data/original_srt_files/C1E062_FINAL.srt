2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:16,504

thanks to you guys from me and Felicia. Doing

3
00:00:16,504 --> 00:00:21,696

community has been the number-one goal from Geek

4
00:00:21,696 --> 00:00:26,536
and Sundry. So again, thank you guys so much for
coming. We're excited to have you; we're excited

5
00:00:26,536 --> 00:00:29,297
to keep doing this. So yeah, you're awesome.

6
00:00:29,297 --> 00:00:32,916
(cheering)

7
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:41,960

00:01:13,477 --> 00:01:18,252
(cheering)

12
00:01:18,252 --> 00:01:23,378
ASHLEY: Whoa! I'm a monstah!

13
00:01:23,378 --> 00:01:37,902
(cheering and chanting "Monster")

14
00:01:37,902 --> 00:01:43,241
ANNOUNCER: Next up is Travis's better half:
Laura Bailey!

15
00:01:43,241 --> 00:02:05,381

16
00:02:05,381 --> 00:02:09,175

ANNOUNCER: Your favorite druid:

19
00:02:28,274 --> 00:02:31,824
MARISHA: What?!

20
00:02:31,824 --> 00:02:36,494
ANNOUNCER: And give it up for Taliesin!

21
00:02:37,016 --> 00:02:55,519

ANNOUNCER: All right, the man who brings it all

(cheering and chanting "DM")

27
00:04:06,332 --> 00:04:07,849
LAURA: Should we sit?

28
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,810
MATT: Well, first and foremost, guys, I want to
thank all of you for being here tonight, for what

29
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:22,122
is already the craziest night of my life in a long
time. And we haven't even started, really, which

30
00:04:22,122 --> 00:04:27,489
is nuts. I want to give a big thanks to the
Dungeons and Dragons team and Wizards of the Coast

31
00:04:27,489 --> 00:04:32,855
for gifting us an awesome series of gift bundles
that we'll be able to give out to some of you

32
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:36,997
lucky winners here in the audience and some of you
lucky folks at home, as well. There'll be

33
00:04:36,997 --> 00:04:43,351
information for that throughout the chat as those
events arrive. And also, in that same vein, thank

34
00:04:43,351 --> 00:04:48,819
you to them for helping me and Chris come together
and help make the event of Force Grey: Giant

35
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:52,470
Hunters, a new series we've been working on,
recently coming out.

36
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,301
(cheering)

37
00:04:55,301 --> 00:05:01,618
MATT: We have four episodes already out for that,
if you haven't seen it yet. The fifth one comes

38
00:05:01,618 --> 00:05:06,790
out this week on Monday on Nerdist. And this will
be introducing Brian Posehn's character; he'll

39
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:13,787
finally be joining the campaign for that, and some
crazy shit goes down, so don't miss it. Yeah, and

40
00:05:13,787 --> 00:05:17,862
I think we have one other cool announcement, if
you guys want to take this one.

41
00:05:17,862 --> 00:05:23,216
ANNOUNCER: Yeah, so we're really excited that this
is Chris Pramas, from amazing Green Ronin, who did

42
00:05:23,216 --> 00:05:29,308
the Titansgrave book and series. And we're
excited; that's been a labor of love for a long

43
00:05:29,308 --> 00:05:35,179
time, but we're able to announce that we will have
a Critical Role campaign book coming out.

44
00:05:35,179 --> 00:05:38,434
(cheering)

45
00:05:38,434 --> 00:05:41,164
ANNOUNCER: So Chris, you want to tell them 
about it?

46
00:05:41,164 --> 00:05:52,414
CHRIS: Hey! Try to get the energy up, people. 
This is exciting. Hey, I'm Chris Pramas. I'm the

47
00:05:52,414 --> 00:05:57,189
president of Green Ronin Publishing. You may know
me from such things as season one of Tabletop and

48
00:05:57,189 --> 00:06:04,143
Titansgrave. And yeah, we're going to be
publishing Critical Role RPG books. They'll be for

49
00:06:04,143 --> 00:06:09,798
5th edition rules, and the awesomest part is that
Matt is going to write them.

50
00:06:09,798 --> 00:06:18,116
(cheering)

51
00:06:18,116 --> 00:06:22,826
ANNOUNCER: So you can look for that Q1 2017?

52
00:06:22,826 --> 00:06:24,670
CHRIS: Spring?

53
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:32,872
ANNOUNCER: Spring 2017. All right, well, I think
that's it, so let's get started. Enjoy the show,

54
00:06:32,872 --> 00:06:33,881
everyone!

55
00:06:33,881 --> 00:06:41,767
(cheering)

56
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:51,521
MATT: So that's interesting. Yeah, as if I didn't
have enough free time already, now I'm putting

57
00:06:51,521 --> 00:06:55,016
that together. But yeah, the first book is going
to be a Tal'Dorei campaign setting, specifically

58
00:06:55,016 --> 00:06:58,791
within Exandria. And if that does well, hopefully
we'll be able to extend that to other continents,

59
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:04,053
like Issylra with Othanzia and Vasselheim, maybe
Marquet and Wildemount; we shall see. But the

60
00:07:04,053 --> 00:07:07,685
first book I'm really excited about. It's a labor
of love, and when that does come out next year, I

61
00:07:07,685 --> 00:07:10,781
hope you guys get a chance to enjoy that, so yay.

62
00:07:10,781 --> 00:07:19,441
(cheering)

63
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:24,321
MATT: So. As we've finished our announcements, I
think it's time we go ahead and dive into our

64
00:07:24,321 --> 00:07:29,535
fantastical journey of Vox Machina in tonight's
episode of Critical Role.

65
00:07:29,535 --> 00:08:59,111
[dramatic music]

66
00:08:59,111 --> 00:09:27,127
(cheering)

67
00:09:27,127 --> 00:09:36,647
MATT: All right, enough of that. Bringing us into
tonight's game of Critical Role. The last time we

68
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:42,679
saw them, the group of adventurers Vox Machina had
found themselves in the Feywild, intent on

69
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:46,957
discovering another one of the Vestiges of
Divergence, one of the many artifacts that they

70
00:09:46,957 --> 00:09:51,365
hope will aid them in their struggle against
Thordak, the Cinder King, and the rest of the

71
00:09:51,365 --> 00:09:55,744
Chroma Conclave. Defeating two of the members,
three still remain, Thordak being the seeming

72
00:09:55,744 --> 00:09:58,864
powerhouse head of that troop.

73
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:04,333
So now, deep in the Feywild, a crazy alternate
dimension in which fey creatures rule a landscape

74
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:09,161
where up is down and everything is topsy-turvy and
nothing is what it seems, they've made their way

75
00:10:09,161 --> 00:10:16,048
through the Moonbrush, parlayed with a group of
lycanthropes-- werewolves, werebears, weretigers--

76
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:24,547
and a group of pixies and made a choice, the
pixies now scattered and stapled to a number of

77
00:10:24,547 --> 00:10:26,660
trees in the forest.

78
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:32,370
The leader of their troop, an extremely large,
powerful werewolf lord named Ukurat, has pledged

79
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:39,576
his aid to some degree in the near future, should
you need it as you travel duskward past the Gilded

80
00:10:39,576 --> 00:10:47,421
Run, eventually to the source of where apparently
this bow Fenthras exists in the Shademirk Bog.

81
00:10:47,421 --> 00:10:53,048
And now, we pick off where we last left off. The
rest of you, after resting in the treetops on the

82
00:10:53,048 --> 00:10:59,220
outskirts of the duskward side of the Moonbrush,
you've come to consciousness, gathered your

83
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:04,912
things, escaped the forest, and headed northward,
just beginning to see the cresting edge of the

84
00:11:04,912 --> 00:11:11,733
tangled river mass of the Gilded Run. And beyond
that, the dark, ominous shadow: the Shademirk Bog.

85
00:11:11,733 --> 00:11:16,293
So before you guys press anywhere forward, 
is there any preparation you want to take

86
00:11:16,293 --> 00:11:20,055
on your adventure?

87
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:22,885
LAURA: Straight-up prep? Oh jeez.

88
00:11:22,885 --> 00:11:27,134
MATT: You're about to travel forward. 
What do you want to do?

89
00:11:27,134 --> 00:11:34,090
SAM: Can you hear us? Yes? 
Are there any potion stores nearby?

90
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,540
(laughter)

91
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,802
MATT: Roll an investigation check. No.

92
00:11:39,802 --> 00:11:42,291
SAM: Ooh, 22.

93
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:48,578
MATT: Oh! You strongly recall information that
inform you that the last bastion of true

94
00:11:48,578 --> 00:11:53,225
civilization is long past you, south of where you
originally came from.

95
00:11:53,225 --> 00:11:58,901
SAM: Well, then I will take a moment 
to limber up for the day. Stretch up.

96
00:11:58,901 --> 00:12:01,218
Yeah, just stretch up. Active squats.

97
00:12:01,702 --> 00:12:06,902
TRAVIS: Can I ask a question? Since I was
obviously out of commission with the whole last

98
00:12:06,902 --> 00:12:09,033
fight that happened--

99
00:12:09,033 --> 00:12:10,636
LAURA: Your own fault, Grog!

100
00:12:10,636 --> 00:12:17,231
TRAVIS: It's not! I was being a politician. Is
anybody hurt? Do we need to heal anybody

101
00:12:17,231 --> 00:12:20,571
before we go? Did these fireflies mess 
with any of you?

102
00:12:20,571 --> 00:12:22,344
TALIESIN: I think everyone's mostly fine.

103
00:12:22,344 --> 00:12:25,128
MARISHA: I think you were the only one who got the
shitty end of that deal.

104
00:12:25,128 --> 00:12:26,420
TRAVIS: That's fucked up.

105
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:30,345
SAM: I will say that Vax looks a little weird.

106
00:12:30,353 --> 00:12:35,357
LAURA: Vax is just strange.

107
00:12:35,357 --> 00:12:40,112
MATT: Vax turns to you and goes, "Yeah, I usually
feel a bit that way. Quiet." As you guys are

108
00:12:40,112 --> 00:12:48,249
preparing for the morning, there's a strange sound
like a simmering, high-pitched whine. Two or three

109
00:12:48,249 --> 00:12:54,502
times, you see these sudden bright flashes of
light in your vicinity. And there's a burst of

110
00:12:54,502 --> 00:12:59,652
white light, as out stepping from it, you see the
somewhat-corporeal, divine energy-based form

111
00:12:59,662 --> 00:13:02,499
of Pike Trickfoot.

112
00:13:02,499 --> 00:13:06,137
(cheering)

113
00:13:06,137 --> 00:13:07,835
LAURA: Oh my god!

114
00:13:07,835 --> 00:13:09,968
ASHLEY: I'm back.

115
00:13:09,968 --> 00:13:12,838
SAM: No! You are not supposed to trust anything 
in the Feywild.

116
00:13:12,838 --> 00:13:15,651
(laughter)

117
00:13:15,651 --> 00:13:17,177
ASHLEY: I swear it's me!

118
00:13:17,177 --> 00:13:20,245
SAM: There's only one way to find out. 
I run up and I kiss her.

119
00:13:20,245 --> 00:13:21,965
(laughter)

120
00:13:21,965 --> 00:13:26,850
ASHLEY: That was a little fast, I think.

121
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:29,548
SAM: It's her.

122
00:13:34,032 --> 00:13:38,552
MATT: Garmelie, at this point, watching this whole
circumstance, walks up to you and goes,

123
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:42,600
"It's good to see you again. I don't know 
where you went away last time, but I hope

124
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,946
"you enjoyed the last sketch I did. If you need 
any more, let me know. I got plenty of paper."

125
00:13:45,946 --> 00:13:51,424
ASHLEY: Okay. What was that? Who were you?

126
00:13:51,424 --> 00:13:57,482
MATT: You look down and see the small faun who you
previously had commissioned to draw--

127
00:13:57,486 --> 00:14:00,390
ASHLEY: Yes. I really love that piece that you did.

128
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,891
MATT: "Well, thank you kindly."

129
00:14:01,891 --> 00:14:03,335
ASHLEY: You're so welcome.

130
00:14:03,335 --> 00:14:07,160
MATT: "Let me know. Your form's closer to mine, 
so it's easy for me to get a full view."

131
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,300
(laughter)

132
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,759
TRAVIS: Whoa.

133
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:16,149
(laughter)

134
00:14:16,151 --> 00:14:18,478
ASHLEY: That's okay.

135
00:14:18,478 --> 00:14:21,949
TRAVIS: Snap. So are we going 
across the river, then?

136
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:25,978
MARISHA: Wait, there's a river?

137
00:14:25,978 --> 00:14:28,571
MATT: Make a perception check!

138
00:14:28,571 --> 00:14:31,571
(laughter)

139
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:34,974
MARISHA: Really? Okay.

140
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:36,779
MATT: First roll of the night.

141
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:38,489
TRAVIS: Ten.

142
00:14:38,489 --> 00:14:40,367
MARISHA: It's okay. 18.

143
00:14:40,367 --> 00:14:46,582
MATT: 18, okay. Glancing ahead of you, you see the
hint of the peak of an ominous mountain range

144
00:14:46,582 --> 00:14:51,744
slowly growing in the distance. At the base of
that, you see a treacherous weave of powerful

145
00:14:51,744 --> 00:14:57,844
rivers rushing past, and around the exterior of
the Shademirk Bog, these large heavy trenches of

146
00:14:57,844 --> 00:15:03,053
water jamming and folding into each other. You've
heard of the Gilded Run, and you've seen a few

147
00:15:03,053 --> 00:15:09,181
stationary rivers in the past, but this is a
cluster of perpetually rushing rapids that fill a

148
00:15:09,181 --> 00:15:14,501
rather sizeable period of the land surrounding the
actual Shademirk Bog. And you can see just past

149
00:15:14,501 --> 00:15:22,252
it, the edge of the bog itself, these very dark,
glistening, almost black oil-caked tree canopies

150
00:15:22,252 --> 00:15:28,125
that vanish into shadow beneath. 
But that's a couple of miles off.

151
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:31,048
TRAVIS: But the rapids are right there?

152
00:15:31,048 --> 00:15:36,315
MATT: You can see them maybe half a mile in front
of you. And you can see the spray occasionally

153
00:15:36,315 --> 00:15:41,204
shooting off some of the rocks, and the shore of
the river just barely shows

154
00:15:41,204 --> 00:15:44,443
the speed of the water passing by.

155
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,809
LAURA: It's definitely not something we can wade
across, I'm assuming.

156
00:15:46,809 --> 00:15:50,712
SAM: We could fashion a crude canoe 
and go down it.

157
00:15:50,712 --> 00:15:56,033
MARISHA: Or I could part the sea.

158
00:15:56,619 --> 00:16:04,914
I'm going to take my staff, 
and I want to feel how deep it is.

159
00:16:04,914 --> 00:16:09,314
MATT: Okay, so you decide to walk the half-mile 
to make it to the river?

160
00:16:09,314 --> 00:16:14,031
MARISHA: I thought we were there. 
It's a lot going on.

161
00:16:14,031 --> 00:16:16,842
SAM: Let's walk the half-mile. It's a half-mile!

162
00:16:16,871 --> 00:16:19,192
MARISHA: And it looks like a long river?

163
00:16:19,192 --> 00:16:22,967
MATT: It's a series of long rivers that completely
wrap around the Shademirk. One side of it seems to

164
00:16:22,967 --> 00:16:29,139
be vanishing into the Green Sea, which you could
barely see to the far seaward side of you, and it

165
00:16:29,139 --> 00:16:33,501
curves around the outside of the Shademirk and
vanishes into the horizon.

166
00:16:36,281 --> 00:16:37,889
SAM: It's a river.

167
00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:39,547
LAURA: It's a big river.

168
00:16:39,547 --> 00:16:44,282
TALIESIN: It looks like a river, at the very
least. Don't trust anything in the Feywild!

169
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:48,081
LAURA: Can I perception and see if there are any
sort of creatures that are visible?

170
00:16:48,081 --> 00:16:55,602
MATT: Do you want to get close to it first? You
have a jaunty jog on your way towards the Gilded

171
00:16:55,602 --> 00:17:03,185
Run. A very short time passes before you begin to
actually hear the waters in the distance. And as

172
00:17:03,185 --> 00:17:08,458
you begin to approach, about a hundred feet from
the edge of the first stripe of river, and you can

173
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:12,157
see some are tighter together, some are only a few
feet between the rivers, some merge into even

174
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:20,043
thicker roaring rapids. They're all traveling from
the seaward side to the tangleward side.

175
00:17:20,043 --> 00:17:23,433
In layman's terms: west to east.

176
00:17:23,615 --> 00:17:27,483
TALIESIN: How far in does it take to cross all of
these little rivers?

177
00:17:27,483 --> 00:17:32,942
MATT: The rivers change in width. The smallest one
you can see is maybe ten feet across. Some of them

178
00:17:32,942 --> 00:17:36,117
swell to upwards of 30, 40 feet, depending at
which point you come across it.

179
00:17:36,117 --> 00:17:39,375
TALIESIN: What's the speed and roughness 
of the ten-foot?

180
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:43,545
MATT: They're all pretty matching in speed, and
they're pretty hefty. You can see there are

181
00:17:43,545 --> 00:17:48,781
occasional rocks in the edges of water that are
just spraying, causing the water to smash into the

182
00:17:48,781 --> 00:17:54,933
side and split off around it. There's nothing
visible in the water drifting, through. Most of it

183
00:17:54,933 --> 00:17:57,901
is destroyed in the process of crashing against
the rocks in the sides of the bank.

184
00:17:57,901 --> 00:18:00,980
TALIESIN: Let's find a nice mix of not-too-wide
and not-too-rapidy. Not too fast.

185
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,510
SAM: And do what?

186
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:08,127
TALIESIN: And start thinking of a way across it
and making sure that it's not magical or strange.

187
00:18:08,127 --> 00:18:10,107
ASHLEY: Could we fly?

188
00:18:10,107 --> 00:18:11,325
LAURA: I can.

189
00:18:11,325 --> 00:18:13,046
ASHLEY: You can.

190
00:18:13,046 --> 00:18:19,695
LAURA: Brother, do you want to scout up ahead?
Maybe fly up above the river and see down into

191
00:18:19,695 --> 00:18:24,189
the oily land? Both of us.

192
00:18:24,189 --> 00:18:29,834
MATT: "Fine, I'll go ahead and give it a look, I
suppose. Although you can fly any time you want,

193
00:18:29,834 --> 00:18:31,583
"if you wish."

194
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:39,035
LAURA: Yes, I can. And I do. I pick my broom up.

195
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:44,954
MATT: He seemingly ducks down into the grasses
that you guys are standing in and vanishes, barely

196
00:18:44,954 --> 00:18:47,471
giving a small path as he disappears.

197
00:18:47,471 --> 00:18:50,097
LAURA: I float above him on the broom.

198
00:18:50,097 --> 00:18:53,780
MATT: Occasionally, you see him glance up and
loudly grumble.

199
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:58,515
LAURA: You are so hidden right now. I can barely
even see you. So hidden.

200
00:18:58,515 --> 00:19:03,502
MATT: "I appreciate the backup, sister." And he
keeps continuing forward. As you get to the edge

201
00:19:03,502 --> 00:19:09,252
of the water itself, he looks inside. It's pretty
clear, the water, as you can see the bottom of it

202
00:19:09,252 --> 00:19:17,514
right there. You can see a deep-set blanket of
greenish-brown algae-type plant life that cakes

203
00:19:17,514 --> 00:19:22,128
the bottom of the river floor, the occasional
stone protruding from it and everything is growing

204
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:31,448
and pushed around it. He releases his raven wings
from his armor, which shoot out in a large 15-foot

205
00:19:31,448 --> 00:19:37,383
wingspan on each side. He jumps in the air, makes
his way over the first short river,

206
00:19:37,383 --> 00:19:38,669
and lands on the other side.

207
00:19:38,669 --> 00:19:42,573
LAURA: Oh, okay. I fly up and I stay above him. 
I don't want to land on the ground.

208
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:49,157
MATT: Okay. Glance over. His wings fold behind him
and he's like, "Was it so hard, sister? Really?"

209
00:19:49,157 --> 00:19:51,347
LAURA: You wasted your entire hour of flying 
for that?

210
00:19:51,347 --> 00:20:02,954
(laughter and applause)

211
00:20:02,954 --> 00:20:07,644
MATT: (sighs)

212
00:20:07,644 --> 00:20:09,702
LAURA: Oh, I got a Vax sigh. I like it.

213
00:20:09,702 --> 00:20:13,998
MATT: He scoots underneath your broom, as you're
hovering on, and one of his wings catches the edge

214
00:20:13,998 --> 00:20:21,134
of it, flicks, and then tries to knock you off
your broom. Make a quick strength check.

215
00:20:21,134 --> 00:20:22,608
LAURA: A what check?

216
00:20:22,608 --> 00:20:24,065
MATT: Strength, my dear.

217
00:20:24,065 --> 00:20:26,759
LAURA: Oh, I got a natural one.

218
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:31,967
(laughter)

219
00:20:31,967 --> 00:20:35,518
LAURA: If you just killed me--

220
00:20:35,518 --> 00:20:39,663
MATT: As the edge of his wings smack the back side
of the broom, it spins out from under you, and for

221
00:20:39,663 --> 00:20:44,243
a moment, you grasp the edge of the front of the
broom, and it slips from your fingers. You flick

222
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:50,228
off, tumble to ground about ten feet. Not too far.
You take one point of damage from the impact;

223
00:20:50,228 --> 00:20:54,983
nothing huge. But as you roll to the side, your
broom scatters across the stones and dips

224
00:20:54,983 --> 00:20:57,263
partially into the river, which begins 
carrying it slowly--

225
00:20:57,263 --> 00:21:01,252
LAURA: No! And I crawl over and grab it.

226
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:05,957
MATT: Okay. You grab it and pull it out. As you
turn back over, your brother's sitting there with

227
00:21:05,957 --> 00:21:09,155
his arms crossed, his wings still folded,
smiling.

228
00:21:09,155 --> 00:21:13,501
LAURA: I swing around and hit him with the broom.

229
00:21:13,501 --> 00:21:20,410
MATT: Make an attack roll.

230
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:24,469
This is not with your bow, by the way. This
is just adding your proficiency bonus. You're not

231
00:21:24,469 --> 00:21:27,852
even proficient. This is an improvised weapon, so
you have disadvantage. Go ahead and roll again.

232
00:21:27,852 --> 00:21:32,993
LAURA: Disadvantage? Aw, come on. 
That was so much better than the first one.

233
00:21:32,993 --> 00:21:34,959
MATT: You're not proficient, really, in attacking
with brooms.

234
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:36,257
LAURA: 13.

235
00:21:36,257 --> 00:21:42,453
MATT: 13? With but an instant of reaction time, it
passes a good solid foot and a half in front of

236
00:21:42,453 --> 00:21:46,863
his face. His wings furl. A couple of feathers
dangle down, and he turns around and decides to

237
00:21:46,863 --> 00:21:49,410
hop over the next bit of the river.

238
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:52,339
LAURA: I hate you sometimes.

239
00:21:52,339 --> 00:21:56,448
MATT: "I know, sister." As he takes off.

240
00:21:56,448 --> 00:22:01,597
LAURA: All right, I get on my broom and fly after
him, like a loser.

241
00:22:01,597 --> 00:22:05,019
MATT: Any of you guys also doing anything, or are
you just watching them scouting ahead?

242
00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:09,005
TRAVIS: We're just watching them fly around.

243
00:22:09,005 --> 00:22:18,096
MATT: As you scoot up to catch up to your brother,
he's probably a good 15 feet ahead of you--

244
00:22:18,096 --> 00:22:22,112
LAURA: Yay, we're back.

245
00:22:22,112 --> 00:22:26,996
ASHLEY: That was such a busy desktop.

246
00:22:26,996 --> 00:22:34,317
MATT: As you hop up after him, you notice his
wings go into a dive, and he ends up curving

247
00:22:34,317 --> 00:22:39,492
downward at an alarming rate, 
diving right into the river.

248
00:22:39,492 --> 00:22:41,399
LAURA: Can I float down and try to grab him?

249
00:22:41,399 --> 00:22:44,041
MATT: I need you to make a wisdom saving throw.

250
00:22:44,041 --> 00:23:00,939
LAURA: A wisdom saving throw? 
Shit, balls, mother-- that's bad: nine.

251
00:23:00,939 --> 00:23:05,970
MATT: As soon as you see your brother dive into
the water, you begin to coast downward. As you do,

252
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:10,132
there's an impulse in your head that begins
pushing and steering the broom lower, lower. And

253
00:23:10,132 --> 00:23:14,113
even in the back of your head, you sense this is
bad; we're going far too steep. It's like you're

254
00:23:14,113 --> 00:23:17,493
outside of your physical body. The control has
alleviated itself, and your body forces you to

255
00:23:17,493 --> 00:23:22,512
splash into the river, as well, both of you guys
submerging yourself in the raging rapids. You guys

256
00:23:22,512 --> 00:23:26,935
see this in the distance, with a splash of two
impacts on the riverside.

257
00:23:26,935 --> 00:23:28,408
TRAVIS: Did we tell them to go fishing?

258
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:30,994
MARISHA: I don't think we did.

259
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:33,762
LAURA: Can we try to get out? Can we try to get
out of the water?

260
00:23:33,762 --> 00:23:37,443
MARISHA: Okay, let's go save our friends.

261
00:23:37,443 --> 00:23:41,416
MATT: There is a ten-foot river for you guys to
traverse first, before you get to them. Each of

262
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:43,888
you who are trying to leap across, make an
athletics check.

263
00:23:43,888 --> 00:23:48,475
MARISHA: I didn't say I was trying to leap
across.

264
00:23:48,475 --> 00:23:50,259
MATT: I said anyone who wants to try.

265
00:23:50,259 --> 00:23:52,481
TRAVIS: You want to hop on the--

266
00:23:52,481 --> 00:23:58,453
(laughter)

267
00:23:58,453 --> 00:24:10,055
SAM: I don't follow. I'll jump on. All right,
Grog's got two gnomes on his back.

268
00:24:10,055 --> 00:24:14,764
MATT: Grog's got two gnomes on his back. 
Of course he does; that's perfect.

269
00:24:14,764 --> 00:24:26,065
LAURA: Help. Right here. Are we underwater, or are
we on top of the water? We're just dying.

270
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:30,268
MATT: Two gnomes on Grog's back. You grab both of
them, do a quick sprint and leap, as heavy as you

271
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:31,779
can. Go ahead and make an athletics check.

272
00:24:31,779 --> 00:24:33,127
TRAVIS: I rolled a 25.

273
00:24:33,127 --> 00:24:36,249
LAURA: Oh, that's good. That's way better.

274
00:24:36,249 --> 00:24:42,411
MATT: Much like how Hulk escapes a fray, you watch
as Grog bounds into the air in a large arc,

275
00:24:42,411 --> 00:24:46,355
slamming into the other side, causing the stones
on the outskirts of the riverbed to crack beneath

276
00:24:46,355 --> 00:24:52,638
him. You stand back up, proud of yourself. 
Pike and Scanlan, you're a little jostled

277
00:24:52,638 --> 00:24:54,522
from the impact.

278
00:24:54,522 --> 00:24:55,986
ASHLEY: That was so fun.

279
00:24:55,986 --> 00:24:58,103
TRAVIS: I know, right?

280
00:24:58,103 --> 00:25:01,427
SAM: I think I landed on my keys!

281
00:25:01,427 --> 00:25:05,516
TALIESIN: And I rolled a nine.

282
00:25:05,516 --> 00:25:15,243
MATT: You smile as you hear a splash behind you.
Percival getting right up to the edge and leaping,

283
00:25:15,243 --> 00:25:19,640
as his foot catches the stone and goes right into
the smaller rapid, being carried, as well.

284
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,828
Keyleth?

285
00:25:20,828 --> 00:25:24,780
MARISHA: The people who are in the water, 
are they being dragged under?

286
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,718
We can just not see them anymore?

287
00:25:26,718 --> 00:25:29,077
MATT: If you take a moment to watch--

288
00:25:29,077 --> 00:25:34,053
MARISHA: Yeah, Percy? Percy?

289
00:25:34,053 --> 00:25:37,007
TALIESIN: I think I'm fine. I'm just wet.

290
00:25:37,007 --> 00:25:39,366
SAM: Is he being carried away?

291
00:25:39,366 --> 00:25:43,912
MATT: The three who've been pulled under the
river-- that includes you, Vex'ahlia, Vax'ildan,

292
00:25:43,912 --> 00:25:46,726
and Percy-- I need you to make 
a constitution check.

293
00:25:46,726 --> 00:25:47,713
LAURA: Constitution?!

294
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:49,745
MARISHA: Why does everything here hate us?

295
00:25:49,745 --> 00:25:57,186
LAURA: Ugh! Oh Jesus! Six.

296
00:25:57,186 --> 00:25:58,754
TRAVIS: You're going to die live.

297
00:25:58,754 --> 00:25:59,968
TALIESIN: Ten.

298
00:25:59,968 --> 00:26:01,731
LAURA: Why am I rolling so bad right now?

299
00:26:01,731 --> 00:26:09,469
MATT: 14. Okay, you manage to pull yourself up to
the surface and you almost get to the point of

300
00:26:09,469 --> 00:26:12,768
actually getting some air, and a force pulls you
back under.

301
00:26:12,768 --> 00:26:15,024
MARISHA: Percy! Aw.

302
00:26:15,024 --> 00:26:19,104
(laughter)

303
00:26:19,104 --> 00:26:25,384
MATT: However, Percy, you do maintain the breath
in your lungs. You and your brother both

304
00:26:25,384 --> 00:26:32,243
(coughs) give away a bulk of the air, and you feel
yourself in the beginning spasms of drowning.

305
00:26:32,243 --> 00:26:37,570
LAURA: Can I cast Grasping Vine from the side of
the river and try to catch myself?

306
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:46,050
MATT: You know what? Yes, you can. In the aspects
of this sequence though, it is a difficult job to

307
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:51,246
cast this. Is it a concentration check or not?

308
00:26:51,246 --> 00:26:53,188
LAURA: I don't know!

309
00:26:53,188 --> 00:26:55,847
MARISHA: Grasping Vine is a bonus action, yo!

310
00:26:55,847 --> 00:27:00,485
MATT: But is it a concentration spell? 
That is the difference.

311
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:03,795
LAURA: I don't have my card because we're
traveling.

312
00:27:03,795 --> 00:27:06,280
SAM: Matt, how far are they from me?

313
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:09,568
MATT: From you guys out there, they're maybe 25
feet from you.

314
00:27:09,568 --> 00:27:12,840
MARISHA: Wait. No, it is. Sorry.

315
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:19,035
MATT: That's all right. So I need you to roll
another constitution check, if you could.

316
00:27:19,035 --> 00:27:20,118
TRAVIS: Roll better.

317
00:27:20,118 --> 00:27:24,581
LAURA: I'm scared of all my dice.

318
00:27:24,581 --> 00:27:27,454
TRAVIS: It's because you have a hundred of them.

319
00:27:27,454 --> 00:27:29,527
LAURA: No, that's good! 19.

320
00:27:29,527 --> 00:27:40,497
MATT: Okay, so yes. As the rapids are rushing by,
you open your eyes, and the sting of the very

321
00:27:40,497 --> 00:27:44,721
high-powered water hitting your eyeballs causes
you to have a hard time even seeing what's up and

322
00:27:44,721 --> 00:27:49,334
down. As you glance up to where the little bit of
light from the ever-dusk sky of the Feywild pulls

323
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:53,904
your attention, you put your hand out, and using
that burst of ranger magical energy, you watch as

324
00:27:53,904 --> 00:28:00,215
the undergrowth of the river itself stretch out
and form this strange, slimy mass of vine that

325
00:28:00,215 --> 00:28:04,505
wraps around you and yanks you out of the water
surface, slamming onto the ground

326
00:28:04,505 --> 00:28:06,122
just outside of the river.

327
00:28:06,122 --> 00:28:10,800
(applause)

328
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,931
LAURA: That's my broom that I'm holding up in my
hand right now.

329
00:28:15,464 --> 00:28:18,380
MARISHA: So the river doesn't hate magic?

330
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,430
LAURA: I don't know.

331
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,984
MARISHA: All right.

332
00:28:21,984 --> 00:28:24,089
LAURA: Where's my brother? Where's Vax?

333
00:28:24,089 --> 00:28:33,706
MARISHA: I'm going to cast Control Water. Where do
I see Percy? Is Percy and Vax together?

334
00:28:33,706 --> 00:28:38,696
MATT: No, Vax is in the next river over. Percy is
about maybe 20 feet from you, but is quickly being

335
00:28:38,696 --> 00:28:39,784
rushed down the river.

336
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:40,732
MARISHA: Vax is? Or Percy?

337
00:28:40,732 --> 00:28:41,664
MATT: Percy.

338
00:28:41,664 --> 00:28:46,246
MARISHA: Okay, so first, I'm going to Control
Water. I'm going to stop the flow of current

339
00:28:46,246 --> 00:28:54,288
and see if I can get it to burp out Percy.

340
00:28:54,758 --> 00:28:57,762
MATT: Okay. Just pat it.

341
00:28:57,762 --> 00:28:59,375
MARISHA: I'm going to burp the river.

342
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:05,855
MATT: (shushing) It's okay, Gilded Run. It's okay.
All right, perfect. So you see this influx and see

343
00:29:05,855 --> 00:29:09,925
Vex get thrown out of the river. You see Percy's
hand get pulled back under as the river pulls him

344
00:29:09,925 --> 00:29:14,465
along at a very fast speed. You concentrate, and
as you put your fingers forward, you see the rapid

345
00:29:14,465 --> 00:29:18,949
river begin to slow down at a certain point, and
it's almost like an invisible dam gets held up as

346
00:29:18,949 --> 00:29:25,861
the waters continue to flow out and carry him a
little bit further. It slowly descends to leave

347
00:29:25,861 --> 00:29:30,317
him on an empty bank of water as the rest of it
slowly seeps to a much lower level. You catch your

348
00:29:30,317 --> 00:29:35,203
breath, Percy. However, I need you to make a
wisdom check, as this is a very powerful,

349
00:29:35,203 --> 00:29:40,455
magically-enforced river, and it's currently
combating the strength of your spell.

350
00:29:40,455 --> 00:29:42,191
This is Keyleth. She's making a wisdom check.

351
00:29:42,191 --> 00:29:47,011
MARISHA: No, okay. Yeah. Wait, what? 
Just a straight wisdom?

352
00:29:47,011 --> 00:29:49,131
LAURA: Oh no!

353
00:29:49,131 --> 00:29:55,140
(laughter)

354
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,437
MARISHA: I just spent a lot of money on these dice
today!

355
00:29:58,437 --> 00:30:08,723
SAM: Wait. Hold on. I've got this. Quick,
everyone. What's that over there? There.

356
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:10,955
MARISHA: Oh, a 15.

357
00:30:10,955 --> 00:30:13,083
LAURA: Was it a one?

358
00:30:13,083 --> 00:30:14,820
MARISHA: I rolled a one.

359
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,726
TRAVIS: You did?

360
00:30:16,726 --> 00:30:18,180
TALIESIN: Wow.

361
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:25,666
MATT: All right, feeling confident in your druidic
ways, but unfortunately not yet undergone the

362
00:30:25,666 --> 00:30:31,276
formal training of the water Ashari, the actual
forceful wave of the river begins to push back

363
00:30:31,276 --> 00:30:37,535
your control over that being, and then cascades
down, picking Percy, once again, back up an

364
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:42,718
additional 30 feet down the stream. You are at the
surface at the moment, though. You are not

365
00:30:42,718 --> 00:30:47,120
considered drowning. You're not drowning. 
Your brother, not doing so hot.

366
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,238
LAURA: Can I send the vine to him?

367
00:30:50,238 --> 00:30:52,781
MATT: Well, before we get to that, the three of
you guys now get to act.

368
00:30:52,781 --> 00:30:56,957
SAM: I'm going to step forward 
and inspire myself.

369
00:30:56,957 --> 00:31:02,972
(cheering)

370
00:31:02,972 --> 00:31:08,272
SAM: I sing to myself: (singing) Scanlan
Shorthalt. I'm a gnome. My name is Scanlan

371
00:31:08,272 --> 00:31:15,743
Shorthalt. I'm a gnome. There's a million chicks 
I haven't boned, but just you wait--

372
00:31:15,743 --> 00:31:18,544
ALL: (singing) Just you wait.

373
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:24,666
(cheering)

374
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:27,956
MATT: Fine, you go and take your inspiration die.

375
00:31:27,956 --> 00:31:36,585
SAM: And then I will cast Bigby's Hand. Bigby's
Hand! Because we're in a symphony hall. And I'm

376
00:31:36,585 --> 00:31:42,255
going to grab Vax and toss him out of the river.

377
00:31:42,255 --> 00:31:46,469
MATT: Okay, taking Bigby's Hand. I need you to
make a strength check for Bigby's Hand,

378
00:31:46,469 --> 00:31:47,762
if you could.

379
00:31:47,762 --> 00:31:56,155
SAM: What does he get? What does Bigby get? I'm
going. It's a different guy. He's a whole guy,

380
00:31:56,155 --> 00:31:58,037
who's not quite as handsome as me.

381
00:31:58,037 --> 00:31:59,726
MATT: Add a plus eight to it.

382
00:31:59,726 --> 00:32:00,672
SAM: Okay. 25.

383
00:32:00,782 --> 00:32:08,027
MATT: 25. You watch as Bigby's Hand plunges into
the river itself, vanishes for a few moments, and

384
00:32:08,027 --> 00:32:15,378
then like a reverse cannonball out of the water,
coming curving around and at an incredible speed,

385
00:32:15,378 --> 00:32:22,534
looks like it's about to spike Vax onto the
water's edge before slowing down

386
00:32:22,534 --> 00:32:27,568
and limply dropping him on the edge 
of the bank front.

387
00:32:27,568 --> 00:32:31,254
SAM: I give him a little pat on the head.

388
00:32:31,254 --> 00:32:33,845
MATT: Which is good, because the pat actually
forces the water out of his lungs.

389
00:32:33,845 --> 00:32:41,399
(coughing and panting) "No flight."

390
00:32:42,982 --> 00:32:43,999
MARISHA: Grog.

391
00:32:43,999 --> 00:32:44,861
TRAVIS: Yeah?

392
00:32:44,861 --> 00:32:45,957
MARISHA: Grab Percy.

393
00:32:45,957 --> 00:32:47,122
TRAVIS: Yes, me?

394
00:32:47,122 --> 00:32:48,784
MARISHA: Grab Percy.

395
00:32:48,784 --> 00:32:53,926
TRAVIS: I take the Alchemy Jug, and I turn it
upside down like diving bell,

396
00:32:53,926 --> 00:32:55,253
and I put it over my head.

397
00:32:55,253 --> 00:33:04,210
(cheering and applause)

398
00:33:04,346 --> 00:33:08,426
TRAVIS: I take the Chain of Returning, and I wrap
it around my waist. And I hand the other end to

399
00:33:08,426 --> 00:33:13,505
Pike because she's got the ogre gauntlets. And I
wade into the river to go get Percy.

400
00:33:13,505 --> 00:33:21,366
(cheering)

401
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:26,911
MATT: Okay, I'll say it is your turn, because he
move quite a bit down the river, but you have a

402
00:33:26,911 --> 00:33:32,071
pretty high movement rate as a barbarian, so you
tie the chain around yourself at your full

403
00:33:32,071 --> 00:33:36,098
movement speed, and you get to the very edge of
the bank and begin to wade in just as you pull the

404
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:41,426
jar over your head. And that's going to be the end
of your action there. Pike, you're holding him at

405
00:33:41,426 --> 00:33:43,873
the edge. I need you to make a strength check, 
if you could.

406
00:33:43,873 --> 00:33:45,861
ASHLEY: I got you, buddy.

407
00:33:45,861 --> 00:33:47,242
TRAVIS: Come on, Monstah.

408
00:33:47,242 --> 00:33:58,684
ASHLEY: Oh wait. Hold on. Where did it go? 
I'm sorry, I forgot how to play.

409
00:33:58,684 --> 00:34:00,445
MATT: I believe it's a plus four.

410
00:34:00,445 --> 00:34:01,876
ASHLEY: 18?

411
00:34:01,876 --> 00:34:07,878
MATT: 18. Without an issue, you watch as this
giant anchor of a man is being held solid by this

412
00:34:07,878 --> 00:34:10,308
tiny rock of a gnomish cleric.

413
00:34:10,308 --> 00:34:11,347
ASHLEY: Yes!

414
00:34:11,347 --> 00:34:14,742
(cheering)

415
00:34:14,742 --> 00:34:18,116
ASHLEY: Go get him, Grog!

416
00:34:18,116 --> 00:34:20,112
TRAVIS: (muffled) Okay.

417
00:34:20,112 --> 00:34:24,466
MATT: You watch as her teeth bite down, and her
tongue sticks out the edge as she digs her feet

418
00:34:24,466 --> 00:34:32,229
into the bottom of the river rock. Percy, you see
a dark form in the river as you're rushing past. I

419
00:34:32,229 --> 00:34:35,844
need you to make a perception check with
disadvantage, as you're being drawn underwater.

420
00:34:35,844 --> 00:34:38,002
TALIESIN: Perception check with disadvantage?

421
00:34:38,002 --> 00:34:39,705
MATT: This is a perception check with
disadvantage.

422
00:34:39,705 --> 00:34:48,873
TALIESIN: That's not that bad. Where's my
perception? There it is: 14.

423
00:34:48,873 --> 00:34:55,705
MATT: 14, okay. Just as you see this strange dark
form appear out of the way, you instinctively

424
00:34:55,705 --> 00:35:04,101
sweep your hand out, and you smack and catch the
edge of Grog's pants.

425
00:35:04,101 --> 00:35:05,971
SAM: He has pants?

426
00:35:05,971 --> 00:35:15,999
(laughter)

427
00:35:15,999 --> 00:35:25,653
MATT: At the hip. And you catch it. Grog, you see
the hand emerge, and you catch the edge of it and

428
00:35:25,653 --> 00:35:31,818
pull him up out of the river. He's now out. Caught
his breath; he's no longer beneath the surface.

429
00:35:31,818 --> 00:35:36,963
You guys are still being pulled, now, by the
water. Your feet are beginning to fall out from

430
00:35:36,963 --> 00:35:41,856
under you as the rocks that are holding you up are
being pulled along by the force of the river.

431
00:35:41,856 --> 00:35:46,074
It seems the longer you're in the river, 
the stronger it's getting.

432
00:35:46,074 --> 00:35:49,152
TRAVIS: Oh shit. Pike! Pull! I got him!

433
00:35:49,152 --> 00:35:54,713
MATT: I need you to roll another strength check,
Pike, as you pull them in. There is a little more

434
00:35:54,713 --> 00:35:57,763
weight on there, so the DC's going to be a little
higher. Go ahead and roll.

435
00:35:57,763 --> 00:35:59,654
TRAVIS: 21.

436
00:35:59,654 --> 00:36:02,344
SAM: Can I quickly inspire her?

437
00:36:02,344 --> 00:36:04,357
MATT: If you want to, yeah.

438
00:36:04,357 --> 00:36:10,845
SAM: Yes. I turn to her and I sing: (singing)
Repairing up your heart when she heals you!

439
00:36:10,845 --> 00:36:21,255
And when you are a bard, you feel it, too! 
And no matter what you do, she heals the pain,

440
00:36:21,255 --> 00:36:23,780
and she's pretty, too!

441
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:28,937
TRAVIS: I love you for doing *NSYNC.

442
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:30,233
MARISHA: Ten-sider!

443
00:36:30,233 --> 00:36:33,137
LAURA: She did a ten-sider.

444
00:36:33,137 --> 00:36:37,505
MATT: She's taking it now, so roll a strength
check and add.

445
00:36:37,505 --> 00:36:40,749
ASHLEY: Oh, it's the same. Or is that this way?

446
00:36:40,749 --> 00:36:42,497
TRAVIS: That's a nine.

447
00:36:42,497 --> 00:36:44,363
LAURA: That's good. That's better!

448
00:36:44,363 --> 00:36:47,153
ASHLEY: 15?

449
00:36:47,153 --> 00:36:50,414
SAM: With my dice?

450
00:36:50,414 --> 00:36:54,130
ASHLEY: Yes. I originally rolled a two.

451
00:36:54,130 --> 00:37:01,914
MATT: Even with the fantastic rhymes of Scanlan's
voice ringing in your ears, and you're holding

452
00:37:01,914 --> 00:37:10,022
tight, you feel your heels begin to scrape as the
river rush is pulling you now towards the river.

453
00:37:10,022 --> 00:37:15,227
Grog and Percy, you feel yourselves being brought
deeper into the center of the river.

454
00:37:15,227 --> 00:37:20,698
MARISHA: Can I try again with the current? It's a
concentration spell up to ten minutes.

455
00:37:20,698 --> 00:37:23,324
MATT: Yeah, you do. So coming back to Keyleth, at
this point.

456
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:27,718
MARISHA: Even the water's angry! (screams)

457
00:37:27,718 --> 00:37:31,306
MATT: Keyleth, I'd like you to make another wisdom
check, if you could.

458
00:37:31,306 --> 00:37:34,108
TRAVIS: Roll good!

459
00:37:34,108 --> 00:37:41,684
MARISHA: Okay, that's better. Straight wisdom? A
saving throw or just a check?

460
00:37:41,684 --> 00:37:43,080
MATT: Just a check.

461
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,068
MARISHA: 16.

462
00:37:44,068 --> 00:37:48,438
MATT: 16. That's better. As you guys are being
swept away, you feel the current begin to subside

463
00:37:48,438 --> 00:37:53,233
slowly, and Pike, once again, you get your ankles
dug in. You begin to pull on this, and between the

464
00:37:53,233 --> 00:37:58,458
two of you and the concentration of Keyleth, you
manage to wrestle Grog and Percy's forms out of

465
00:37:58,458 --> 00:38:01,737
the river onto the bank. Now you guys are between
the two.

466
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:04,934
(cheering)

467
00:38:04,934 --> 00:38:08,286
SAM: You guys, we defeated a creek.

468
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,922
TALIESIN: We didn't actually even defeat it.

469
00:38:10,922 --> 00:38:15,353
MARISHA: No, we haven't even gotten started.
There's like 50 more creeks in front of us.

470
00:38:15,353 --> 00:38:18,939
LAURA: Me and Vax are on one side, and everyone
else is on the other, then?

471
00:38:18,939 --> 00:38:26,583
MATT: Yes. There are a couple of small trees that
are planted or grown up between the river banks,

472
00:38:26,583 --> 00:38:28,868
and you can still hear the rapids rushing past.

473
00:38:28,868 --> 00:38:31,141
SAM: How many more rivers would we have to cross?

474
00:38:31,141 --> 00:38:33,894
MATT: Looking ahead of you, there's probably 12.

475
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:39,263
TRAVIS: Let's just go home. Fuck it.

476
00:38:39,263 --> 00:38:42,048
TALIESIN: That was very clever with the pot, 
by the way.

477
00:38:42,048 --> 00:38:44,683
TRAVIS: Yeah, right? I figured if anything was
going to hit me in the head,

478
00:38:44,683 --> 00:38:46,368
it would hit the jug first.

479
00:38:46,368 --> 00:38:52,838
TALIESIN: That was less clever, but still very
impressive. What if we were to throw your chain,

480
00:38:52,838 --> 00:38:56,024
or if we could throw the rope across the river?

481
00:38:56,024 --> 00:38:59,714
LAURA: Actually, I'm going to use my earring 
so I don't have to shout.

482
00:38:59,714 --> 00:39:01,406
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, that's better.

483
00:39:01,406 --> 00:39:09,973
LAURA: I feel like when I was crossing the river,
I wanted to kill myself. And I'm afraid that

484
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:11,724
anybody else crossing the river--

485
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:14,673
TALIESIN: No, Vax has already crossed. We're not
going to feel the angst coming off of him.

486
00:39:14,673 --> 00:39:23,228
MATT: The experience, when you were trying to
cross over, was reminiscent of that urge to jump

487
00:39:23,228 --> 00:39:30,566
whenever you're near the edge. That weird, very
base impulse whenever you get to a point of danger

488
00:39:30,566 --> 00:39:35,574
that says, do it! It's like that being triggered
and preyed upon.

489
00:39:35,574 --> 00:39:42,266
MARISHA: It's a river of impulses? Such an
allegory for so many things.

490
00:39:42,266 --> 00:39:49,105
TALIESIN: Here's a thought. We take the rope, we
tie ourselves to it, we toss it over to the two of

491
00:39:49,105 --> 00:39:56,681
you, we start using it to wade, you help pull us
over. Everybody would have to be terrible for

492
00:39:56,681 --> 00:40:00,178
everything to go. Everybody will be fighting
together to get across.

493
00:40:00,178 --> 00:40:04,070
ASHLEY: We can attach the rope to the Immovable
Rod. Just put it in the ground.

494
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:09,938
LAURA: I think I have it. I thought Grog had it,
but I think I might have picked it up after.

495
00:40:09,938 --> 00:40:14,110
TALIESIN: As long as we're tied together, we can
only go so far. It'll be like mountain climbing.

496
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:16,570
SAM: But that just gets us across one, right?

497
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:18,330
TALIESIN: I think they're across two.

498
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:22,595
TRAVIS: How wide's the second river between us and
Vax?

499
00:40:22,595 --> 00:40:24,735
MATT: It would take you guys about 20 feet
across.

500
00:40:24,735 --> 00:40:27,003
TALIESIN: That's good. 20 feet across.

501
00:40:27,003 --> 00:40:28,858
SAM: No, there's ten more rivers!

502
00:40:28,858 --> 00:40:30,589
LAURA: There's so many rivers!

503
00:40:30,589 --> 00:40:35,041
SAM: Can we become mist form? Are our minds
affected when we're mist form?

504
00:40:35,041 --> 00:40:36,695
TALIESIN: Yes. I'm sure.

505
00:40:36,695 --> 00:40:38,265
LAURA: Is it? Are we?

506
00:40:38,265 --> 00:40:40,650
MARISHA: I didn't learn mist form today.

507
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:42,278
TRAVIS: Fucking hell.

508
00:40:42,278 --> 00:40:48,655
ASHLEY: What if we made a boat and then floated
down the river?

509
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:49,918
TRAVIS: They're rapids.

510
00:40:49,918 --> 00:40:54,009
ASHLEY: That sounds like a terrible idea, by the
look of his face.

511
00:40:54,009 --> 00:40:59,490
MARISHA: Does it look like all the rivers are
connected?

512
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:04,037
MATT: It looks like some of them swell between
each other and then split off again. Some are

513
00:41:04,037 --> 00:41:07,570
solitary, from your current position that you can
see, but you only have what's immediately near you

514
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:11,393
to really see. Since some of these are hills, and
it carves into part of these hills, you don't have

515
00:41:11,393 --> 00:41:16,830
a complete view of how they intertwine and merge
beyond the immediate hillsides.

516
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:18,324
LAURA: Hey, Garmelie!

517
00:41:18,324 --> 00:41:19,566
SAM: Yeah, where's he?

518
00:41:19,566 --> 00:41:21,181
MATT: He's back on the other side.

519
00:41:21,181 --> 00:41:23,710
LAURA: Hi!

520
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:25,983
MATT: "Some help, please?"

521
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:31,619
LAURA: Have you heard any stories about how people
crossed these damn rivers before?

522
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:37,080
MATT: "I told you I've heard about this land. 
I haven't actually been here."

523
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:40,398
LAURA: I know! So tell me what you've heard!

524
00:41:40,398 --> 00:41:48,348
MATT: "It's dangerous, and it keeps the Shademirk
from spreading!"

525
00:41:48,348 --> 00:41:51,593
LAURA: Cool.

526
00:41:51,593 --> 00:41:54,739
TRAVIS: Garmelie! Hop in the river!

527
00:41:54,739 --> 00:41:58,300
MATT: "No!"

528
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:06,522
SAM: Has my minute of Hand worn off yet?

529
00:42:06,522 --> 00:42:09,482
MATT: I'd say it's getting towards the end.

530
00:42:09,482 --> 00:42:12,865
SAM: All right. I'm going to take Garmelie and
throw him across as many rivers as I can.

531
00:42:12,865 --> 00:42:20,699
(cheering)

532
00:42:20,699 --> 00:42:24,240
MATT: Make a strength check.

533
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:28,574
SAM: 25 again.

534
00:42:28,574 --> 00:42:33,960
MATT: Being a small and relatively light-weight
fey creature, but also smug in a standing position

535
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:40,217
after proclaiming his negative approach to Grog's
idea, he doesn't quite notice the spiraling purple

536
00:42:40,217 --> 00:42:47,324
hand that swings up from behind, grasping him and
lifting him into the air with an incredible speed.

537
00:42:47,324 --> 00:42:53,995
All you hear is the distant (squeal) as the hand
full-on fastball special chucks him.

538
00:42:53,995 --> 00:43:03,901
Arcing overhead. (distant scream, impact) 
A little plume of dust.

539
00:43:03,901 --> 00:43:06,423
LAURA: Did he make it? How far did he get?

540
00:43:06,423 --> 00:43:08,582
MATT: He made it past five of them.

541
00:43:08,582 --> 00:43:16,895
(applause)

542
00:43:16,895 --> 00:43:28,953
MATT: And also suffered 22 points of damage.
There's a long, awkward pause

543
00:43:28,953 --> 00:43:31,621
as you see no movement.

544
00:43:31,621 --> 00:43:33,838
SAM: Oh god. I think I just killed him.

545
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:35,587
LAURA: Scanlan, you're such a dick!

546
00:43:35,587 --> 00:43:37,896
TALIESIN: That was a little harsh.

547
00:43:37,896 --> 00:43:44,162
MATT: Which gets more and more awkward the longer
it goes by, until eventually you see a shift

548
00:43:44,162 --> 00:44:01,907
and this small form rise up, raises a thumb... 
which quickly transitions into a middle finger.

549
00:44:01,907 --> 00:44:07,920
(cheering)

550
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,058
MARISHA: He's fine!

551
00:44:10,058 --> 00:44:14,375
SAM: He's doing great.

552
00:44:14,375 --> 00:44:20,018
TRAVIS: Scanlan, Keyleth, if I had magic, I would
freeze all the water, so go ahead and do that.

553
00:44:20,018 --> 00:44:26,705
MARISHA: If Bigby's Hand had about ten seconds
left, I've got about nine minutes left on this

554
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:34,495
Control Water spell. Why don't we try and move as
fast as possible along with the chain and maybe

555
00:44:34,495 --> 00:44:39,993
the Immovable Rod. Let's go. You guys go first.
And I'm going to try and halt the flow.

556
00:44:39,993 --> 00:44:42,293
MATT: Make a wisdom check, if you could.

557
00:44:42,293 --> 00:44:46,648
TRAVIS: Come on, you stupid opal dice!

558
00:44:46,648 --> 00:44:49,687
LAURA: Is that a natural 20?

559
00:44:49,687 --> 00:45:02,513
MARISHA: No, it's another fucking one! Useless!

560
00:45:02,513 --> 00:45:06,670
LAURA: Put it away, Keyleth. Put it away 
for the rest of the night.

561
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:08,648
MARISHA: I spent so much money on these!

562
00:45:08,648 --> 00:45:12,058
TRAVIS: You've got to retire that bitch.

563
00:45:12,058 --> 00:45:16,429
MATT: No! They just haven't been charged properly.
(cackles)

564
00:45:16,429 --> 00:45:19,399
LAURA: Put it in its dice jail.

565
00:45:19,399 --> 00:45:21,025
TALIESIN: See? Better.

566
00:45:21,025 --> 00:45:26,252
MARISHA: Percy! Don't touch my dice, Percy!

567
00:45:26,252 --> 00:45:32,856
MATT: So as you guys begin to prepare your attempt
to cross the river, Keyleth concentrates. The

568
00:45:32,856 --> 00:45:37,743
river stalls for a moment, and then pushes past,
seemingly unaffected. Mind you, the spell does

569
00:45:37,743 --> 00:45:42,485
seem to have an effect when you're having a better
time concentrating, but it is a magical force

570
00:45:42,485 --> 00:45:47,507
versus a magical force, and you can see it
actually angrily swells against the resistance.

571
00:45:47,507 --> 00:45:52,790
That's where the actual tension comes from. There
is something living, like an entity that these

572
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:55,392
rivers seem to almost mingle as.

573
00:45:55,392 --> 00:45:57,326
TRAVIS: Are there a bunch of trees?

574
00:45:57,326 --> 00:46:00,070
MATT: There are a few sporadic trees scattered
around, yes.

575
00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:01,452
TRAVIS: How tall are they?

576
00:46:01,452 --> 00:46:07,447
MATT: They're not that tall. Some are maybe 15, 20
feet up. These trees specifically are a little

577
00:46:07,447 --> 00:46:12,555
more marsh-based. They're not quite swamp-based
trees, but that's as tall as they get.

578
00:46:12,555 --> 00:46:14,998
TRAVIS: And the river's 20 feet wide, right?

579
00:46:14,998 --> 00:46:17,292
MATT: No, these are maybe five feet wide.

580
00:46:17,292 --> 00:46:21,057
LAURA: Oh. Five feet. We could jump across them?

581
00:46:21,057 --> 00:46:27,001
MATT: Oh, the rivers. Sorry. The trees are five
feet wide. I misunderstood. Yes, the actual rivers

582
00:46:27,001 --> 00:46:29,298
are between ten to 20 feet.

583
00:46:29,298 --> 00:46:31,075
LAURA: Do you have Tree Stride?

584
00:46:31,075 --> 00:46:34,362
MARISHA: I do, but I can only cast that 
on myself.

585
00:46:34,362 --> 00:46:37,991
LAURA: I thought we could all use it, always?

586
00:46:37,991 --> 00:46:47,329
MARISHA: We can use mist form. Sorry. There's
Teleport Via Plants, which I did not bring today.

587
00:46:47,329 --> 00:46:49,489
TRAVIS: What did you bring today?

588
00:46:49,489 --> 00:46:53,313
MARISHA: I brought Control Water, Grog!

589
00:46:53,313 --> 00:47:01,137
SAM: Wait. The total distance from us to 
the end of the 12th river is how far?

590
00:47:01,249 --> 00:47:06,334
MATT: Probably close to 150 feet?

591
00:47:06,334 --> 00:47:08,691
TALIESIN: We can do that in five minutes.

592
00:47:08,691 --> 00:47:10,514
SAM: So I can make it with Pike super fast.

593
00:47:10,514 --> 00:47:11,743
LAURA: How?

594
00:47:11,743 --> 00:47:13,014
MARISHA: Dimension Door.

595
00:47:13,014 --> 00:47:15,037
SAM: Yeah. But the rest of you are fucked.

596
00:47:15,037 --> 00:47:20,249
LAURA: No! This is really good! This is good,
because with the Immovable Rod--

597
00:47:20,249 --> 00:47:25,433
SAM: I can set it, forget it. 
Set it and forget it.

598
00:47:25,433 --> 00:47:37,271
LAURA: And then tie maybe the endless rope to it.
And then you teleport back to the other side.

599
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:39,106
TRAVIS: How's that going to work?

600
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:40,256
LAURA: I don't know.

601
00:47:40,256 --> 00:47:46,088
ASHLEY: Wait. If we Dimension Door, what if you
turn into an animal to fly, and then you have a

602
00:47:46,088 --> 00:47:47,754
broom, and someone can ride on your broom?

603
00:47:47,754 --> 00:47:55,639
MARISHA: I could potentially turn us into animals
that can swim, which is why I was wondering if the

604
00:47:55,639 --> 00:48:00,962
rivers were connected. Maybe we can jump like
salmon, going upstream?

605
00:48:00,962 --> 00:48:08,867
SAM: Don't tell Trinket!

606
00:48:08,867 --> 00:48:13,355
LAURA: Trinket is safe in this necklace 
right now.

607
00:48:13,355 --> 00:48:15,854
TRAVIS: Can you raise earth? Can you make a dam?

608
00:48:15,854 --> 00:48:21,322
MARISHA: I can, and I did bring Move Earth, as
well as Wall of Stone. To be totally honest, I am

609
00:48:21,322 --> 00:48:30,547
terrified of messing with the ground. I'm afraid
if I move the earth, it will eat me. It will split

610
00:48:30,547 --> 00:48:34,702
open and swallow me. I could try it.

611
00:48:34,702 --> 00:48:39,973
LAURA: Wait, did I hear right that these rivers
are alive? What did I hear?

612
00:48:39,973 --> 00:48:41,538
MARISHA: They're magical rivers.

613
00:48:41,538 --> 00:48:43,177
TRAVIS: I'm going to chop down a tree.

614
00:48:43,177 --> 00:48:50,939
LAURA: You're going to chop down a tree? 
Grog, Keyleth picked a flower

615
00:48:50,939 --> 00:48:52,932
and the entire world ended.

616
00:48:52,932 --> 00:48:55,319
TRAVIS: We are getting nowhere, super fast.

617
00:48:55,319 --> 00:48:58,805
TALIESIN: Easy plan. Easy peasy. 
Teleport with the Immovable Rod.

618
00:48:58,805 --> 00:49:01,938
You shoot one end of the rope to him.

619
00:49:01,938 --> 00:49:03,858
LAURA: Oh, why didn't I think of that?

620
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:05,671
TALIESIN: Everything's easy peasy.

621
00:49:05,671 --> 00:49:08,742
MARISHA: Why didn't we think of that?

622
00:49:08,742 --> 00:49:13,480
SAM: Okay. Give me the rod. You take the eternal
string or whatever it's called.

623
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:15,480
LAURA: I have the eternal string, 
and I have the rod.

624
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:20,564
TRAVIS: Can I walk over to a tree just in case
their plan fails? I want to start chopping.

625
00:49:20,564 --> 00:49:26,647
MATT: You go up to one of the nearby trees at the
edge, and you can see across the way, it looks

626
00:49:26,647 --> 00:49:33,053
like there's part of a crumpled stone corner, some
long dilapidated ruin. You can see what looks to

627
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:39,387
be one dried tree log that has fallen over and
rotting on the other side. But there is one tree

628
00:49:39,387 --> 00:49:43,589
right on the edge of the bank that you guys are on
that leads across this next river that is pretty

629
00:49:43,589 --> 00:49:46,799
solid looking. Maybe four feet in thickness there
and 25 feet.

630
00:49:46,799 --> 00:49:50,381
LAURA: Don't do it, Grog! Do not do it yet!

631
00:49:50,381 --> 00:49:52,398
TRAVIS: I hope your stupid plan works!

632
00:49:52,398 --> 00:49:59,803
MARISHA: Hey, Grog. Remember when we almost died
because I picked a flower?

633
00:49:59,803 --> 00:50:01,459
Just throwing it out there.

634
00:50:01,459 --> 00:50:03,459
TRAVIS: I'm super bored, so do your plan.

635
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:06,371
LAURA: I'm going to start tying the rope 
to an arrow.

636
00:50:06,371 --> 00:50:13,314
MATT: You're tying the rope to an arrow. Okay. You
have, at this point, a good seven minutes left.

637
00:50:13,314 --> 00:50:16,907
MARISHA: Of the Control Water? All right. 
Let's do this.

638
00:50:16,907 --> 00:50:20,369
LAURA: All right. Are you going to teleport, and
then we're going to try to do that?

639
00:50:20,369 --> 00:50:21,547
SAM: Sure, let's do it.

640
00:50:21,547 --> 00:50:24,888
LAURA: So you teleport first. I'll shoot the
arrow, see if I can actually get it to stick over

641
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:26,769
there, and then you can do the...

642
00:50:26,769 --> 00:50:29,527
SAM: Okay. Pike, you with me? Hand in hand?

643
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:30,613
ASHLEY: Hand in hand.

644
00:50:30,613 --> 00:50:34,729
SAM: Here we go. I Dimension Door us across the
river, if it works.

645
00:50:34,729 --> 00:50:41,053
MATT: Okay. As you guys grasp hands, both of them
vanish in a swirl of purplish-pink smoke. You see,

646
00:50:41,053 --> 00:50:46,625
simultaneously, across all the banks, right at the
edge of the Shademirk, this little burst of

647
00:50:46,625 --> 00:50:50,708
energy. You guys land on the ground immediately,
your feet sinking about three inches into this

648
00:50:50,708 --> 00:50:57,369
black sludge-like tar material. Already, you can
smell the outskirts of the Shademirk. It's a very

649
00:50:57,369 --> 00:51:06,904
sulfurous decay smell that permeates the ground by
you, and you can see it seeping into the river

650
00:51:06,904 --> 00:51:13,469
like a slow-moving morass of syrup, and the water
carries it away upstream, like an angry force of

651
00:51:13,469 --> 00:51:17,689
cleaning. It's a little sludgy where you stand,
but you guys are across.

652
00:51:17,689 --> 00:51:21,439
SAM: All right. Hey! Shoot an arrow at me!

653
00:51:21,439 --> 00:51:27,623
LAURA: All right, I shoot an arrow! Not directly
at him, but pretty close to him.

654
00:51:27,623 --> 00:51:31,122
SAM: That's a long shot.

655
00:51:31,122 --> 00:51:38,454
LAURA: I have a really long-- I'm just going to
shoot a couple arrows just to be sure.

656
00:51:38,454 --> 00:51:44,259
SAM: I instinctively cover my neck.

657
00:51:44,259 --> 00:51:45,574
LAURA: 17.

658
00:51:45,574 --> 00:51:48,292
MATT: 17. What did you roll?

659
00:51:48,292 --> 00:51:49,691
LAURA: A five.

660
00:51:49,691 --> 00:51:56,328
MATT: Okay, just making sure. Because ones are
always fun for situations like this. All right.

661
00:51:56,328 --> 00:52:03,911
You fire the arrow. It goes a little wide while
you're aiming in the proximity of Scanlan and arc

662
00:52:03,911 --> 00:52:08,850
off and staples to one of the outside trees,
sticking in it. The rope goes lax and begins to be

663
00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:13,615
carried in the water, and you can see the tension
as the river itself seems to be trying to pull the

664
00:52:13,615 --> 00:52:15,190
rope underneath the rapids.

665
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:16,563
LAURA: I hold the other side of the rope.

666
00:52:16,563 --> 00:52:20,408
MATT: Okay, you begin pulling it up, and it's hard
to pull up. The actual river is almost pulling

667
00:52:20,408 --> 00:52:22,120
the rope under itself.

668
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:23,346
TALIESIN: I grab it, too.

669
00:52:23,346 --> 00:52:26,097
MATT: All right. I need both of you guys to make
strength checks together.

670
00:52:26,097 --> 00:52:28,419
MARISHA: Can I try and stop the current 
once again?

671
00:52:28,419 --> 00:52:31,105
MATT: What's the range on Control Water?

672
00:52:31,105 --> 00:52:32,143
MARISHA: 300 feet.

673
00:52:32,143 --> 00:52:33,200
MATT: Yeah you can do that.

674
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,639
MARISHA: Okay. Calm, waters, calm.

675
00:52:34,639 --> 00:52:36,439
LAURA: And hook it to the Immovable Rod there.

676
00:52:36,439 --> 00:52:38,974
SAM: Oh yeah! I forgot that whole part 
of the plan.

677
00:52:38,974 --> 00:52:44,408
MARISHA: Oh my god.

678
00:52:44,408 --> 00:52:46,159
TALIESIN: What are you doing?

679
00:52:46,159 --> 00:52:47,547
ASHLEY: No!

680
00:52:47,547 --> 00:52:50,796
LAURA: You can't use it anymore. You're not
allowed to use that dice anymore.

681
00:52:50,796 --> 00:52:52,667
TRAVIS: Just throw it offstage. Just throw it.

682
00:52:52,667 --> 00:52:59,343
MARISHA: I am not giving you all that dice!

683
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:02,881
(laughter)

684
00:53:02,881 --> 00:53:06,841
TRAVIS: Say it. What was it?

685
00:53:06,841 --> 00:53:09,514
MATT: I'm assuming it's a low roll.

686
00:53:09,514 --> 00:53:13,903
MARISHA: It's a fucking one! 
For the third time in a row!

687
00:53:13,903 --> 00:53:16,071
MATT: All right, so what did you guys roll 
for your strength checks?

688
00:53:16,071 --> 00:53:18,609
LAURA: Oh, for strength checks I rolled...

689
00:53:18,609 --> 00:53:21,748
MATT: As there has been no druidic aid,
unfortunately, in this particular moment.

690
00:53:21,748 --> 00:53:25,135
SAM: Pike, do you know any sailor's knots?

691
00:53:25,135 --> 00:53:27,338
ASHLEY: I sure do!

692
00:53:27,338 --> 00:53:29,548
SAM: Can you tie a sailor knot around this
Immovable Rod?

693
00:53:29,548 --> 00:53:30,865
ASHLEY: I sure can!

694
00:53:30,917 --> 00:53:32,516
SAM: Which one?

695
00:53:32,516 --> 00:53:34,348
ASHLEY: The swirley-whirley.

696
00:53:34,348 --> 00:53:39,642
(laughter)

697
00:53:39,642 --> 00:53:44,380
MATT: As the two of you rush over the 30 feet to
the tree that the rope is stapled to right now,

698
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:48,913
it's taut and you can see it's starting to break
the arrow as the strength of the rope

699
00:53:48,913 --> 00:53:50,895
being pulled into the river.

700
00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:52,558
LAURA: Percy, what did you roll for strength?

701
00:53:52,558 --> 00:53:57,331
TALIESIN: Oh, that's good. I rolled a ten. 
I'm not that strong!

702
00:53:57,331 --> 00:53:59,780
LAURA: We are so weak!

703
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:01,130
ASHLEY: We are doing so great!

704
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:07,623
MATT: Between the two of you guys, you manage 
to slowly pull it out of most of the rapids.

705
00:54:07,623 --> 00:54:11,343
It's still being dragged by one. It takes you
another minute or so, but you manage to get the

706
00:54:11,343 --> 00:54:16,712
rope entirely taut against the edge of the arrow.
Pike, you catch the actual rope on the other side

707
00:54:16,712 --> 00:54:21,100
before the arrow snaps and carries it back by the
strength of their pull. So you take it and you

708
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:29,330
make a little knot. Tie it strong from your
experience as a sailor to the Immovable Rod, and

709
00:54:29,330 --> 00:54:31,326
it is solid and in place.

710
00:54:31,326 --> 00:54:33,882
TALIESIN: So I tie the rope to myself.

711
00:54:33,882 --> 00:54:38,498
LAURA: Yeah, we should each tie the rope 
to all of us.

712
00:54:38,498 --> 00:54:39,817
TRAVIS: What?

713
00:54:39,817 --> 00:54:41,285
LAURA: Grog, you're on the end there 
with the rope.

714
00:54:41,285 --> 00:54:42,775
TRAVIS: Nope. I'm going to cut down this fucking
tree.

715
00:54:42,775 --> 00:54:44,417
LAURA: No, Grog!

716
00:54:44,417 --> 00:54:47,123
TRAVIS: All right, fine. I'll help.

717
00:54:47,123 --> 00:54:48,610
TALIESIN: We're going to tie a rope to you.

718
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:49,767
TRAVIS: Around me?

719
00:54:49,767 --> 00:54:53,212
LAURA: Around all of us, yeah. So Keyleth, too,
you get a rope, as well.

720
00:54:53,212 --> 00:54:55,563
You get a rope! <i>You</i> get a rope!

721
00:54:55,563 --> 00:54:56,929
MARISHA: We all get ropes!

722
00:54:56,929 --> 00:54:59,178
TALIESIN: You should be in front, and then 
the rest of us.

723
00:54:59,178 --> 00:55:00,933
LAURA: Oh, okay, sure.

724
00:55:00,933 --> 00:55:02,303
SAM: Don't forget Vax.

725
00:55:02,303 --> 00:55:06,322
LAURA: And Vax, of course. Obviously, my brother,
who is standing right here very stealthily.

726
00:55:06,322 --> 00:55:13,906
MATT: He looks to you and his wings (whoosh). 
He lets them dissipate, as they're not

727
00:55:13,906 --> 00:55:18,110
going to be much of a help in this moment. 
"If I'm going to be tied to the rope,

728
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:21,318
"I want to be tied close to you, at least." 
He shimmies over.

729
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:24,649
You're all tying yourselves like a daisy chain?

730
00:55:24,649 --> 00:55:27,354
LAURA: You know, like you do.

731
00:55:27,354 --> 00:55:31,307
MATT: All right. Once you've all affixed it, what
is the order in which you guys are affixed?

732
00:55:31,307 --> 00:55:33,319
I'm just curious!

733
00:55:33,319 --> 00:55:35,629
TRAVIS: I'll be in the front.

734
00:55:35,629 --> 00:55:39,522
LAURA: It's Grog, then Percy.

735
00:55:39,522 --> 00:55:41,240
TALIESIN: Vax, Vex.

736
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:42,543
LAURA: Keyleth.

737
00:55:42,543 --> 00:55:45,650
SAM: And then leave a little slack for Garmelie 
at the end.

738
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:48,182
LAURA: Oh, right, because we've got to pick him up
on the way through.

739
00:55:48,182 --> 00:55:50,806
MATT: He's in between the two of you guys 
right now. He's waiting.

740
00:55:50,806 --> 00:55:52,823
LAURA: We're on our way to you, Garmelie. 
Don't worry!

741
00:55:52,823 --> 00:56:08,740
MATT: "Good!" He looks over his shoulder at
Scanlan and goes, "Good." All right, you guys all

742
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:12,735
begin to pull yourselves forward on the rope,
taking your time to make sure that if anything bad

743
00:56:12,735 --> 00:56:16,699
happens, you take a moment to pause and help out
your friends. I need everyone who's on the edge

744
00:56:16,699 --> 00:56:19,005
of that rope to make a general athletics check.

745
00:56:19,005 --> 00:56:20,945
LAURA: Everybody holding on to the rope?

746
00:56:20,945 --> 00:56:23,865
MATT: Everybody who's currently tied 
onto the rope, so not the gnomes.

747
00:56:23,865 --> 00:56:24,854
LAURA: Athletics?

748
00:56:24,854 --> 00:56:25,820
MATT: Yes.

749
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:26,872
TRAVIS: 20.

750
00:56:26,872 --> 00:56:29,986
MARISHA: That's acceptable.

751
00:56:29,986 --> 00:56:32,228
TALIESIN: 13.

752
00:56:32,228 --> 00:56:34,948
LAURA: Are we in any kind of favored terrain right
now?

753
00:56:34,948 --> 00:56:38,590
TALIESIN: Only for Aquaman is this favored
terrain.

754
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:40,232
MATT: I'm going to say no.

755
00:56:40,232 --> 00:56:45,938
LAURA: Okay, cool. 11 there, with the dice and the
adding.

756
00:56:45,938 --> 00:56:50,735
MATT: So that's 20. What did you get?

757
00:56:50,735 --> 00:56:51,711
MARISHA: 22.

758
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:52,954
MATT: 22, okay.

759
00:56:52,954 --> 00:56:57,164
ASHLEY: Making a comeback!

760
00:56:57,164 --> 00:57:02,496
MATT: You guys begin to pull yourselves forward.
The two half-elf twins, in their physical

761
00:57:02,496 --> 00:57:09,582
waif-like state, begin to find themselves being
carried hard down the first, second, and third

762
00:57:09,582 --> 00:57:12,788
progressive rivers as you guys pull through, 
but you manage to make up the slack

763
00:57:12,788 --> 00:57:15,992
and get them back on the land each time. 
It slowed down your progress.

764
00:57:15,992 --> 00:57:18,424
You only have three more minutes on your spell.

765
00:57:18,424 --> 00:57:26,968
MARISHA: Keyleth's got angry tears of frustration
in the back as she's trying to control the water.

766
00:57:26,968 --> 00:57:32,518
Runny eyeliner, like it's 2001.

767
00:57:32,518 --> 00:57:42,578
MATT: All right. You manage to make it across the
next six or so rivers. You get to where Garmelie

768
00:57:42,578 --> 00:57:45,110
is, who's sitting there tapping his little hoof
impatiently.

769
00:57:45,110 --> 00:57:47,239
LAURA: Tie yourself on, there, Garmelie.

770
00:57:47,239 --> 00:57:53,952
MATT: He looks up at the rope, which is basically
head level. "Give me some slack!"

771
00:57:53,952 --> 00:57:58,557
LAURA: (grunts)

772
00:57:58,557 --> 00:58:04,711
MATT: "Thanks." He wraps it around his midsection,
ties it up, and it's uncomfortably tight because

773
00:58:04,711 --> 00:58:10,168
as soon as you start moving it pulls on his
midsection. When it's pulled taut, because of his

774
00:58:10,168 --> 00:58:16,738
size, he's actually lifted up between you guys, so
his feet dangle, and he's top-heavy in how it

775
00:58:16,738 --> 00:58:20,909
tied, so he rotates. His feet are in the air.

776
00:58:20,909 --> 00:58:26,796
(cheering)

777
00:58:26,796 --> 00:58:34,439
MATT: You bring yourself over to the eighth, the
ninth river finally traversed. A few other scary

778
00:58:34,439 --> 00:58:39,080
moments. Keyleth, I want you to make a wisdom
check again to see if you can aid

779
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:41,730
this next length.

780
00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:59,743
MARISHA: Fuck you, no. It's a 19! Total 19.

781
00:58:59,743 --> 00:59:08,071
MATT: Harnessing the inspiration of frustration at
your recent failures to control the elements that

782
00:59:08,071 --> 00:59:15,486
you've been so hoping to learn to bring to your
beck and call, you look forward at what would be

783
00:59:15,486 --> 00:59:21,138
the third-to-last river in your progress forward,
and angrily do this with your hands. You guys

784
00:59:21,138 --> 00:59:26,174
watch as the river, like a paper, is torn asunder,
the water held at bay.

785
00:59:26,174 --> 00:59:28,420
MARISHA: I'm sorry!

786
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:30,601
TALIESIN: You're great! Run!

787
00:59:30,601 --> 00:59:32,152
MARISHA: Just go!

788
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:39,210
MATT: You guys run down the bank, stepping over.
As you start to reach the other side of the bank,

789
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:45,550
Grog, your heavy foot hits something that seems to
react to the impact of your weight.

790
00:59:45,550 --> 00:59:49,601
SAM: Like a thing? Like a person?

791
00:59:49,601 --> 00:59:56,007
MATT: You guys make your way up the edge of the
river. As you glance over the side, you see

792
00:59:56,007 --> 00:59:58,671
something in the mud vanish beneath.

793
00:59:58,671 --> 01:00:01,010
TRAVIS: I stepped on a catfish.

794
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:05,098
ASHLEY: Let's eat it.

795
01:00:05,098 --> 01:00:06,773
LAURA: Get up and out. Up and out.

796
01:00:06,773 --> 01:00:11,892
MATT: As you guys all get across, the water slams
back, continuing to flow with the river. Angrily,

797
01:00:11,935 --> 01:00:15,727
it roars and seems to almost swell up over the
bank where it once was before it slowly descends

798
01:00:15,727 --> 01:00:17,460
back to its natural rushing rapids.

799
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:18,935
MARISHA: That's a really big catfish.

800
01:00:18,935 --> 01:00:25,615
MATT: There are two more rivers now ahead of you.
There's one right before you, and then the one

801
01:00:25,615 --> 01:00:27,406
that separates you from Scanlan and Pike.

802
01:00:27,406 --> 01:00:31,433
SAM: Are they multiplying? 
Oh no, it's because we got them wet!

803
01:00:31,433 --> 01:00:39,047
MATT: There were roughly 12 ahead of you when you
asked. You guys have now traversed nine of them,

804
01:00:39,047 --> 01:00:44,385
ten of them, so there's only two left at this
point. Keyleth.

805
01:00:44,385 --> 01:00:48,318
TALIESIN: I believe in you.

806
01:00:48,318 --> 01:01:04,740
MARISHA: I didn't mean to do that. I was really
nervous. But it's an 18, so 25. You know what,

807
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:14,562
Percy? So I'm going to talk. I'm going to be like:
Look, river. I'm your friend. I don't want any

808
01:01:14,562 --> 01:01:19,664
tension between us. I'm just trying to make it
across you, you know?

809
01:01:19,664 --> 01:01:26,105
MATT: The actual near-growl of the rapids begins
to slowly subside in the river before you as the

810
01:01:26,105 --> 01:01:33,643
water sinks down into a slower, more gentle pace.
You can see it building up and backing up behind

811
01:01:33,643 --> 01:01:38,174
you as the river here comes to a soft, cool dip
that you guys can begin to walk through as well.

812
01:01:38,174 --> 01:01:40,463
MARISHA: Good river. Good boy.

813
01:01:40,463 --> 01:01:47,385
TRAVIS: Can I keep an eye out for whatever I
stepped on in the river?

814
01:01:47,385 --> 01:01:51,032
MATT: Yeah, make a perception check.

815
01:01:51,032 --> 01:01:53,597
TRAVIS: Six!

816
01:01:53,597 --> 01:02:04,255
MATT: Grog, being in the front of the troupe, as
the river is slowly separated for this, you step

817
01:02:04,255 --> 01:02:11,914
down into the mud, and you don't notice a similar
shift curl up behind you as suddenly a rapid

818
01:02:11,914 --> 01:02:19,446
(whoosh). A set of gargantuan, long tooth-filled
jaws come pouring out of the mud underneath the

819
01:02:19,446 --> 01:02:35,033
bank, snapping towards your large half-giant form.
(evil chuckle) It has begun. That is a 22 to hit.

820
01:02:35,033 --> 01:02:37,026
I believe that hits your armor class.

821
01:02:37,026 --> 01:02:38,400
TRAVIS: That'll hit.

822
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:44,914
MATT: All righty. Getting ready for the first real
attack damage of tonight's episode.

823
01:02:44,914 --> 01:02:53,088
LAURA: How come we never noticed the battle map
has a river on it? Oh no!

824
01:02:53,088 --> 01:02:58,140
MATT: You suffer 27 points of piercing damage.

825
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:04,325
(groaning, laughter)

826
01:03:04,325 --> 01:03:13,345
MATT: You, Grog, are suddenly grappled. The jaws
have latched onto your midsection and hold you.

827
01:03:13,345 --> 01:03:20,197
You guys look ahead as you see this form, this
spray of dark grimy mud and river-bottom muck gets

828
01:03:20,197 --> 01:03:28,297
flung into the air. You see what looks to be a far
larger than you've ever seen before crocodile-like

829
01:03:28,297 --> 01:03:38,766
entity has come bursting out from under the river.
You see the sheer force of the impact pushes him

830
01:03:38,766 --> 01:03:44,922
forward and carries him onto the other side of the
river, in doing so, dragging all of you behind him

831
01:03:44,922 --> 01:03:46,383
at a rapid pace.

832
01:03:46,383 --> 01:03:48,399
TRAVIS: We're across!

833
01:03:48,399 --> 01:03:55,568
MATT: Most of you go flying in an arc at the sheer
force of this impact. I need you guys to make

834
01:03:55,568 --> 01:03:57,784
acrobatics checks to try to stop yourselves.

835
01:03:57,784 --> 01:04:00,049
TRAVIS: It's not a catfish!

836
01:04:00,049 --> 01:04:04,705
MARISHA: Acrobatics or athletics?

837
01:04:04,705 --> 01:04:06,084
MATT: Acrobatics.

838
01:04:06,084 --> 01:04:09,509
TALIESIN: That's my jam. 27.

839
01:04:09,509 --> 01:04:10,974
MARISHA: 15.

840
01:04:10,974 --> 01:04:12,039
LAURA: 28.

841
01:04:12,039 --> 01:04:13,300
TRAVIS: 21.

842
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:18,274
MATT: All right, and your brother does well. Of
course he does. You guys all manage to catch

843
01:04:18,274 --> 01:04:24,945
yourselves right now, still attached by the rope
as you now see this heaping 15- to 20-foot-long

844
01:04:24,945 --> 01:04:31,714
giant barrel of muscle, green scaled skin, but
what looks to be hundreds of tiny roots that

845
01:04:31,714 --> 01:04:36,182
spread from the center of its midsection, reaching
into the ground. As it begins to move forward,

846
01:04:36,182 --> 01:04:42,527
it's actually rooting and uprooting itself as it
moves. You can see the moisture and the life force

847
01:04:42,527 --> 01:04:46,383
of the land is pulsing into its form 
as it holds Grog in its jaws.

848
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:48,534
I need you all to roll initiative.

849
01:04:48,534 --> 01:05:00,362
(cheering)

850
01:05:00,362 --> 01:05:03,006
SAM: Wait, where are we? 
Where are the gnomes?

851
01:05:03,006 --> 01:05:05,498
MATT: You guys are way over here on the edge.

852
01:05:05,498 --> 01:05:08,474
LAURA: Oh no! Wait, where are we? 
I don't see us at all.

853
01:05:08,474 --> 01:05:11,777
SAM: Oh no, we have to go back!

854
01:05:11,777 --> 01:05:13,807
TALIESIN: To the future!

855
01:05:13,807 --> 01:05:18,643
MATT: Please remind me the marching order again.
If I recall, it was Grog...

856
01:05:18,643 --> 01:05:20,735
TALIESIN: Me.

857
01:05:20,735 --> 01:05:22,612
MATT: Grog, Percy. Thank you.

858
01:05:22,612 --> 01:05:24,329
TRAVIS: Garmelie was in the middle somewhere.

859
01:05:24,329 --> 01:05:26,326
LAURA: I think he was between me and Vax.

860
01:05:26,326 --> 01:05:31,753
MATT: Garmelie was between the two of you guys,
yeah.

861
01:05:31,753 --> 01:05:34,971
TALIESIN: It was Vax, Garmelie, Vex, Keyleth.

862
01:05:34,971 --> 01:05:36,566
MATT: Perfect.

863
01:05:36,566 --> 01:05:39,397
TALIESIN: Don't say that. That's not cool.

864
01:05:39,397 --> 01:05:44,468
MATT: You get to see a little behind the field
there.

865
01:05:44,468 --> 01:05:48,935
TALIESIN: I haven't seen that river in two years.
It's so nice.

866
01:05:48,935 --> 01:05:53,904
SAM: Pikey pants, what should we do? 
We should go help them, right?

867
01:05:53,904 --> 01:05:55,779
ASHLEY: I don't know.

868
01:05:55,779 --> 01:06:02,299
SAM: I mean, this mud is nice.

869
01:06:02,299 --> 01:06:05,738
ASHLEY: But I did roll shit initiative, as usual.

870
01:06:05,738 --> 01:06:13,519
MATT: There he is. There's Garmelie. Great.

871
01:06:13,519 --> 01:06:20,657
TALIESIN: That was terrible initiative. 
I am embarrassed by my initiative.

872
01:06:20,657 --> 01:06:22,916
LAURA: My initiative is really bad, as well.

873
01:06:22,916 --> 01:06:24,351
SAM: This is crazy.

874
01:06:24,351 --> 01:06:30,544
MATT: So top of the round, we have 
initiative of 25 to 20?

875
01:06:30,544 --> 01:06:35,623
MARISHA: 20. Shut up, really?

876
01:06:35,623 --> 01:06:38,244
LAURA: Go, Keyleth!

877
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:41,929
MARISHA: I don't think that's ever happened
before. That's never happened.

878
01:06:41,929 --> 01:06:47,400
MATT: All right, so Keyleth, a 20. 
20 to 15, anyone?

879
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:49,594
TRAVIS: 18.

880
01:06:49,594 --> 01:06:54,743
MATT: All right. 15 to ten?

881
01:06:54,743 --> 01:06:56,122
TALIESIN: 13.

882
01:06:56,122 --> 01:06:57,343
LAURA: 14.

883
01:06:57,343 --> 01:07:02,228
TRAVIS: This is our first live initiative.

884
01:07:02,228 --> 01:07:03,422
LAURA: Yeah.

885
01:07:03,422 --> 01:07:05,920
MARISHA: Yeah, because it didn't happen 
last time!

886
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:09,534
TRAVIS: We're all going to die.

887
01:07:09,534 --> 01:07:12,583
MATT: Scanlan and Pike, what did you guys get?

888
01:07:12,583 --> 01:07:15,374
ASHLEY: I rolled a big fat six.

889
01:07:15,374 --> 01:07:17,577
SAM: I got a four!

890
01:07:17,577 --> 01:07:22,985
MATT: The gnomes bringing up the rear.

891
01:07:22,985 --> 01:07:30,570
SAM: We were caught off-guard by this whole thing.
She was teaching me the swirley-whirley

892
01:07:30,570 --> 01:07:34,370
while this was all going on.

893
01:07:34,370 --> 01:07:36,890
ASHLEY: That's exactly what was happening.

894
01:07:36,890 --> 01:07:44,380
MATT: All right, so Keyleth, you're up first. You
watch as this giant mass of a creature is now

895
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:51,151
clutching Grog in its jaws, and you see its tail
begin to whip up, and it's now guarding itself on

896
01:07:51,151 --> 01:07:55,076
all sides as the roots are dragging themselves
into the earth around you.

897
01:07:55,076 --> 01:07:57,758
MARISHA: So it has roots. It appears to be
plant-based?

898
01:07:57,758 --> 01:08:02,387
MATT: Elements of it. As you get a closer look
now, you can see parts of its scaly hide emerge

899
01:08:02,387 --> 01:08:08,009
into leaf-like protrusions. It is a strange
mixture of both giant croc and some sort of a

900
01:08:08,009 --> 01:08:09,636
plant-based entity.

901
01:08:09,636 --> 01:08:16,347
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to go a little risky
here. I'm going to cast Speak With Plants.

902
01:08:16,347 --> 01:08:19,389
MATT: All right.

903
01:08:19,389 --> 01:08:21,821
TRAVIS: Look at Mercer's face.

904
01:08:21,821 --> 01:08:24,915
MARISHA: Dumb idea, yeah.

905
01:08:24,915 --> 01:08:31,121
TALIESIN: He's thinking an alligator voice is
going to hurt a lot. That's what he's thinking.

906
01:08:31,121 --> 01:08:46,745
MATT: This is a perfect Keyleth moment. So Speak
With Plants generally works with <i>plants.</i>

907
01:08:46,745 --> 01:08:54,239
MARISHA: Sure, but he appears to be fellow kin.

908
01:08:54,239 --> 01:08:55,675
LAURA: He's got roots, yo.

909
01:08:55,675 --> 01:09:00,570
MATT: He does. However, in the purposes of this
type of circumstance, it's usually meant for

910
01:09:00,570 --> 01:09:07,708
smaller plants that have no sentience that you can
normally interact with, like roses and petunias.

911
01:09:07,708 --> 01:09:13,139
MARISHA: I've done this before 
with talking to the treant.

912
01:09:13,139 --> 01:09:18,562
MATT: You can probably communicate with it, yes.
I'm saying, issuing commands on this might be

913
01:09:18,562 --> 01:09:20,734
a little more difficult for the rest of the spells.

914
01:09:20,734 --> 01:09:24,033
MARISHA: What if I cast at a higher level? 
Would that help?

915
01:09:24,033 --> 01:09:27,736
MATT: This is not a spell that can be cast at a
higher level, unfortunately. So what do you want

916
01:09:27,736 --> 01:09:30,152
to do? You're casting Speak With Plants.

917
01:09:30,152 --> 01:09:36,171
MARISHA: Well, I cast it, so I'm going to say:
Hey! You spit that out of your mouth

918
01:09:36,171 --> 01:09:37,873
right now, mister!

919
01:09:37,873 --> 01:09:45,031
(laughter)

920
01:09:45,031 --> 01:09:50,939
MARISHA: You don't know where that's been! 
And trust me, I do.

921
01:09:50,939 --> 01:09:54,154
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

922
01:09:54,154 --> 01:09:58,611
(cheering)

923
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:02,013
LAURA: No! Don't do it!

924
01:10:02,013 --> 01:10:10,385
TALIESIN: (laughs)

925
01:10:10,385 --> 01:10:13,911
TRAVIS: No way. There's no fucking way.

926
01:10:13,911 --> 01:10:24,864
SAM: In a way, it doubled in its level.

927
01:10:24,864 --> 01:10:28,771
LAURA: You do not touch that dice anymore.

928
01:10:28,771 --> 01:10:35,208
MARISHA: Seven.

929
01:10:35,208 --> 01:10:39,962
MATT: As you shout this out, pointing at the large
crocodile-like entity, you look deep into its

930
01:10:39,962 --> 01:10:46,398
beady black and purple eye that darts around in
the sunken socket of its crocodile skull, and you

931
01:10:46,398 --> 01:10:53,303
can see it re-initiate its clutch on Grog,
readjusting, pulling him even further into the

932
01:10:53,303 --> 01:10:58,016
jaw. Grog, you suffer another nine points of
piercing damage.

933
01:10:58,016 --> 01:11:01,010
TRAVIS: I take what?

934
01:11:01,010 --> 01:11:02,764
MATT: Another nine points of piercing damage.

935
01:11:02,764 --> 01:11:04,355
TRAVIS: Nine points!

936
01:11:04,355 --> 01:11:06,266
TALIESIN: Yeah, you haven't raged yet.

937
01:11:06,266 --> 01:11:09,465
MATT: Sorry, Keyleth. Are you going to stay 
where you are?

938
01:11:09,465 --> 01:11:21,676
MARISHA: Where am I? Oh, I see where I am. Can I
move towards that tree, away from the river

939
01:11:21,676 --> 01:11:23,996
that also wants to eat us?

940
01:11:23,996 --> 01:11:27,577
MATT: Sure. You get that far before the rope on
your midsection stops you.

941
01:11:27,577 --> 01:11:31,338
TRAVIS: Oh shit, we're all tied together!

942
01:11:31,338 --> 01:11:43,551
MARISHA: Okay, yeah. All right. Cool. Done. Go.

943
01:11:43,551 --> 01:11:46,036
MATT: Grog, your turn.

944
01:11:46,036 --> 01:11:48,944
TRAVIS: Yeah. Where did he bite me, by the way?

945
01:11:48,944 --> 01:11:54,525
MATT: He has you in his jaws by the midsection,
and he's trying to turn you so you lose your

946
01:11:54,525 --> 01:11:59,034
footing, and you're getting pretty close right
now. So he has you clamped right around your hip

947
01:11:59,034 --> 01:12:03,775
and chest right now. The nostril's right here, and
the other half of the jaw is almost completely

948
01:12:03,775 --> 01:12:05,192
wrapped around the side.

949
01:12:05,192 --> 01:12:07,627
TRAVIS: I don't give a fuck! I go into a rage!

950
01:12:07,627 --> 01:12:16,280
(cheering)

951
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:18,914
TRAVIS: Can I go into a frenzied rage?

952
01:12:18,914 --> 01:12:21,245
MATT: Yes, you may.

953
01:12:21,245 --> 01:12:23,520
TRAVIS: And I use my bloodaxe, 
and I'm going to start whacking him

954
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:26,670
in his stupid plant monster face.

955
01:12:26,670 --> 01:12:30,397
MATT: All right, so you use your bonus action to
go into the rage, and you have two attacks,

956
01:12:30,397 --> 01:12:31,660
so go for it.

957
01:12:31,660 --> 01:12:34,339
LAURA: Yeah, kill him, Grog. Kill him!

958
01:12:34,339 --> 01:12:36,113
TRAVIS: That's a 30.

959
01:12:36,113 --> 01:12:40,183
MATT: That'll hit.

960
01:12:40,183 --> 01:12:46,005
TRAVIS: For the second one, it's a 21.

961
01:12:46,005 --> 01:12:52,661
MATT: That also does hit, yes. Roll damage 
for both of those strikes.

962
01:12:52,661 --> 01:13:03,473
TRAVIS: So the first one is a 19, plus five points
of necrotic damage for 24.

963
01:13:03,473 --> 01:13:05,575
MATT: All right, 24 points of damage.

964
01:13:05,575 --> 01:13:07,871
TRAVIS: And the second one! Oh shit.

965
01:13:07,871 --> 01:13:12,530
That's 15, plus another five points 
of necrotic damage for 20.

966
01:13:12,530 --> 01:13:21,636
MATT: 20 points. Fantastic. So you're slamming it
as hard as you can with the axe in the side.

967
01:13:21,636 --> 01:13:25,834
You're jamming it into the side. You can see part
of its jaw split open from the impact, and you can

968
01:13:25,834 --> 01:13:30,673
see a gleaming of white, slick bone beneath that
begins to expose from where you slammed the sharp

969
01:13:30,673 --> 01:13:36,726
end of the axe into it twice in a row. It's
(snarling) shaking you in its grasp once more.

970
01:13:36,726 --> 01:13:40,433
TRAVIS: I've always wanted to be a dog toy!

971
01:13:40,433 --> 01:13:49,150
TALIESIN: Uh. I feel like we're learning a lot.

972
01:13:49,150 --> 01:13:53,184
MARISHA: Have you told many people that?

973
01:13:53,184 --> 01:13:55,696
TRAVIS: Now I have.

974
01:13:55,696 --> 01:14:01,938
MATT: Does that end your turn, Grog? All right.
Next is the croc's turn. At the beginning of its

975
01:14:01,938 --> 01:14:06,963
turn, you watch as the wound you just left begins
to slowly seal shut. You watch the roots

976
01:14:06,963 --> 01:14:12,110
protruding from its body begin to suck the water,
moisture, and life force from the land around it,

977
01:14:12,110 --> 01:14:16,184
and it begins to heal itself slowly. So some of
that damage goes away.

978
01:14:16,184 --> 01:14:17,871
SAM: Goes away?

979
01:14:17,871 --> 01:14:21,803
MATT: It begins to heal itself, healing from the
ground it's rooted into.

980
01:14:21,803 --> 01:14:24,142
TRAVIS: I probably should have tried to break the
grapple.

981
01:14:24,142 --> 01:14:27,407
LAURA: That would've been a smart move.

982
01:14:27,407 --> 01:14:31,016
TRAVIS: I haven't hit anything in forever.

983
01:14:31,016 --> 01:14:41,141
MATT: Grog. 24. I believe that hits?

984
01:14:41,141 --> 01:14:42,867
TRAVIS: Yeah, that hits.

985
01:14:42,867 --> 01:14:50,818
MATT: You guys watch as the crocodile backs this
way slightly, which allows Vax and Garmelie to get

986
01:14:50,818 --> 01:14:58,526
an attack of opportunity. Vax does hit. Well, no,
it could be sneak attack, although Grog

987
01:14:58,526 --> 01:15:00,807
technically right now is not threatening it.

988
01:15:00,807 --> 01:15:02,671
TRAVIS: Yeah, I am. I'm hitting it with a thing!

989
01:15:02,671 --> 01:15:04,667
LAURA: Garmelie is standing next to him, too.

990
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:13,380
MATT: I'll let it. Sure. The timing is pretty
close on this, and you'll hear why in a second.

991
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:17,106
SAM: Seven more crocs appear.

992
01:15:17,106 --> 01:15:20,023
TRAVIS: I'm about to get jacked up.

993
01:15:20,023 --> 01:15:22,054
TALIESIN: We'll see.

994
01:15:22,054 --> 01:15:33,303
MATT: 31 points of damage from Vax. Garmelie
misses. He is awesome. So as it pulls away, you

995
01:15:33,303 --> 01:15:39,078
guys watch as the crocodile spins around in the
direction of you guys, grabs and tugs Grog,

996
01:15:39,078 --> 01:15:47,448
throwing him up into the air. In doing so, all of
you guys get pulled this way, and Keyleth dragged

997
01:15:47,448 --> 01:15:54,698
behind at that point. The jaws open, and Grog
vanishes down the creature's gullet.

998
01:15:54,698 --> 01:16:00,184
ASHLEY: No!

999
01:16:00,184 --> 01:16:02,748
TALIESIN: We're all still tied to him!

1000
01:16:02,748 --> 01:16:05,352
LAURA: We're all attached to him, though!

1001
01:16:05,352 --> 01:16:09,549
MATT: You all got dragged right to the edge of its
mouth, so right now, Percy, you have the rope

1002
01:16:09,549 --> 01:16:12,933
right at the edge of its giant snapping jaws.

1003
01:16:12,933 --> 01:16:17,210
TRAVIS: We're a big set of anal beads.

1004
01:16:17,210 --> 01:16:21,293
TALIESIN: Can he roll for gag reflex? There's a
rope coming out of his throat.

1005
01:16:21,293 --> 01:16:25,183
MATT: This creature's pretty profound at
swallowing larger entities, so that's fine.

1006
01:16:25,183 --> 01:16:38,724
(laughter)

1007
01:16:38,724 --> 01:16:44,872
MATT: Anyway. Grog, you're currently blinded and
restrained.

1008
01:16:44,872 --> 01:16:46,616
TRAVIS: Blinded and restrained?

1009
01:16:46,616 --> 01:16:52,432
MATT: Yeah. Things go to darkness. You now have a
general idea of what Scanlan and Vax went through,

1010
01:16:52,432 --> 01:16:54,239
oh but a few days ago.

1011
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:57,803
TRAVIS: (singing) Hello, darkness, my old friend!

1012
01:16:57,803 --> 01:17:08,279
MATT: Cool. Yeah, you are completely locked inside
of it right there. It also spins around as it does

1013
01:17:08,279 --> 01:17:13,370
so, and its tail (whiplash) whips out, and you see
at the very tip of its tail what looks to be some

1014
01:17:13,370 --> 01:17:20,195
sort of strange, jagged stinger. This is going to
whip around in the direction of you, Vex.

1015
01:17:20,195 --> 01:17:21,765
LAURA: Me?

1016
01:17:21,765 --> 01:17:25,941
MATT: That is going to be only a 14.

1017
01:17:25,941 --> 01:17:27,491
LAURA: Oh, good. It misses.

1018
01:17:27,491 --> 01:17:32,101
MATT: Yeah. You duck under it as it scrapes across
the ground, causing this huge section of the dirt

1019
01:17:32,101 --> 01:17:36,216
to grind past, leaving a small trough behind.
That's going to end its turn.

1020
01:17:36,216 --> 01:17:38,067
It is now your turn, Vex.

1021
01:17:38,067 --> 01:17:48,248
LAURA: Me? Okay. I am going to send Trinket out
and attack it with Bestial Fury.

1022
01:17:48,248 --> 01:17:58,004
MATT: Trinket appears at the side of it suddenly,
spawning out of this strange burst of shadow

1023
01:17:58,004 --> 01:18:01,812
energy from the center of your necklace. (roars)

1024
01:18:01,812 --> 01:18:04,615
LAURA: Trinket, attack the thing!

1025
01:18:04,615 --> 01:18:11,550
MATT: Trinket happily does so. He has advantage on
both of these strikes. Go for it.

1026
01:18:11,550 --> 01:18:16,625
LAURA: Can I use my dagger that's on me to try to
cut the rope that is attached to my front?

1027
01:18:16,625 --> 01:18:19,434
MATT: You would have to pull a dagger out, and
that would be a bonus action. So you can do that

1028
01:18:19,434 --> 01:18:21,511
now, but you wouldn't be able to cut it 
until next turn.

1029
01:18:21,511 --> 01:18:25,580
LAURA: Okay. Well, I'll attack with Trinket, and
I'll pull my dagger out.

1030
01:18:25,580 --> 01:18:27,416
MATT: Okay.

1031
01:18:27,416 --> 01:18:36,156
LAURA: Okay, that's good. Wow, I never attack with
him. How about that. 26!

1032
01:18:36,156 --> 01:18:37,465
MATT: Hits.

1033
01:18:37,465 --> 01:18:38,593
LAURA: It does.

1034
01:18:38,593 --> 01:18:39,754
MATT: Yes.

1035
01:18:39,754 --> 01:18:45,180
LAURA: So does he do the bite attack, or does he
do the claw attack?

1036
01:18:45,180 --> 01:18:50,866
MATT: We'll say the first one will be the bite,
and then the claw.

1037
01:18:50,866 --> 01:18:57,404
LAURA: Okay, so now he's rolling for claws. Okay,
so that's a 25 for the second one.

1038
01:18:57,404 --> 01:19:00,225
MATT: Both hit. Roll damage for each.

1039
01:19:00,225 --> 01:19:06,197
LAURA: Okay. Oh Jesus, I'm so stupid! 
Okay, that's eight?

1040
01:19:06,197 --> 01:19:08,732
MATT: Eight?

1041
01:19:08,732 --> 01:19:09,753
LAURA: Yeah.

1042
01:19:09,753 --> 01:19:11,602
MATT: Eight damage, all right.

1043
01:19:11,602 --> 01:19:21,396
LAURA: And then, for the next one he gets two
claws, and he's going to use his fours. Jeez

1044
01:19:21,396 --> 01:19:27,430
Louise. Five plus seven is 13. No, 12.

1045
01:19:27,430 --> 01:19:33,700
MATT: Total of 20 points of damage 
as Trinket tears into the side

1046
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:35,432
of this giant gator-like creature.

1047
01:19:35,432 --> 01:19:39,444
LAURA: That's good! And then I cast 
Hunter's Mark!

1048
01:19:39,444 --> 01:19:47,917
MATT: As you pull your dagger out, you're like,
Hunter's-- damn it. But yeah, at the beginning of

1049
01:19:47,917 --> 01:19:51,728
your next turn, trying to hack away at that rope;
that's fine. That ends your turn, Vex, unless you

1050
01:19:51,728 --> 01:19:53,807
want to try and move.

1051
01:19:53,807 --> 01:19:57,457
LAURA: Can I try to fly up in the air? It won't do
anything. I'm stuck on the ground.

1052
01:19:57,457 --> 01:20:00,544
MATT: Currently, yes. And you don't have your
broom at the ready.

1053
01:20:00,544 --> 01:20:04,785
LAURA: No, so I'll stay where I am, I guess. I'll
continue to be flung around.

1054
01:20:04,785 --> 01:20:07,379
MATT: Perfect. Well done. Percy, you're up.

1055
01:20:07,379 --> 01:20:12,833
TALIESIN: Oh boy. A lot of my plans got
swallowed.

1056
01:20:12,833 --> 01:20:15,089
TRAVIS: (muffled) Help me!

1057
01:20:15,089 --> 01:20:21,945
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to pull out the Retort
pistol, because Bad News will not be happy at this

1058
01:20:21,945 --> 01:20:26,050
range. First thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
take a head shot. I'm going to try and blind him

1059
01:20:26,050 --> 01:20:30,467
for the round. This is going to go great!

1060
01:20:30,467 --> 01:20:33,952
SAM: Laura just quit the show.

1061
01:20:33,952 --> 01:20:36,251
MARISHA: She couldn't do it anymore.

1062
01:20:36,251 --> 01:20:42,598
TALIESIN: See, I'm too nervous to even take
Sharpshooter, so we're just going to do this

1063
01:20:42,598 --> 01:20:46,657
clean. And I roll a natural 20. Fuck it.

1064
01:20:46,657 --> 01:20:58,970
MATT: Hey, Percy. You are in melee with the
creature. You have disadvantage

1065
01:20:58,970 --> 01:21:01,033
on your ranged attack. Roll again.

1066
01:21:01,033 --> 01:21:03,139
(groaning)

1067
01:21:03,139 --> 01:21:04,778
SAM: Such a stickler.

1068
01:21:04,778 --> 01:21:09,153
(cheering)

1069
01:21:09,153 --> 01:21:11,236
MATT: Don't even try it.

1070
01:21:11,236 --> 01:21:17,535
TALIESIN: The trick is not to care. It's good
enough. 26.

1071
01:21:17,535 --> 01:21:19,510
MATT: Okay, that does hit.

1072
01:21:19,510 --> 01:21:26,268
TALIESIN: Fuck, I forgot to cast Hex. Goddamn it.
Can I throw my bonus in there really quick?

1073
01:21:26,268 --> 01:21:27,969
SAM: There's children in the audience.

1074
01:21:27,969 --> 01:21:35,370
TALIESIN: They watch the show; they've heard me
say worse. Can I sneak Hex in there?

1075
01:21:35,370 --> 01:21:39,220
MATT: I would say given the fact that you said
specifically that you were too nervous to do

1076
01:21:39,220 --> 01:21:43,188
Sharpshooter, you're also too nervous to remember
your Hex, but you can finish your turn with that,

1077
01:21:43,188 --> 01:21:44,447
if you'd like.

1078
01:21:44,447 --> 01:21:48,817
TALIESIN: I can get it in between attacks.
Technically not.

1079
01:21:48,817 --> 01:21:50,679
MATT: No, that's true. You can do it. 
I'll let you.

1080
01:21:50,679 --> 01:21:56,419
TALIESIN: It's a bonus action. I'll do whatever
you say. I'm not going to fight you. I'm trying to

1081
01:21:56,419 --> 01:22:04,547
find my d10s. Okay, here we are. So that's 
11 points of piercing damage.

1082
01:22:04,547 --> 01:22:08,599
MATT: All right. Marking that down. What's the
save DC on that?

1083
01:22:08,599 --> 01:22:12,433
TALIESIN: The save DC is a 19 
on a constitution save.

1084
01:22:12,433 --> 01:22:19,813
MATT: That is a 12, so yes, it is currently
blinded.

1085
01:22:19,813 --> 01:22:24,540
TALIESIN: It's not blinded. It has disadvantage on
attacks until my next turn.

1086
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:29,727
MATT: There we go. And you are Hexing it, 
you said?

1087
01:22:29,727 --> 01:22:37,771
TALIESIN: And now I'm Hexing. I'm going to give
him a disadvantage on strength checks.

1088
01:22:37,771 --> 01:22:39,949
MATT: Okay, good to know.

1089
01:22:39,949 --> 01:22:43,143
TALIESIN: Strength or constitution? I'm not
asking. Why am I asking people? Asking is for

1090
01:22:43,143 --> 01:22:47,477
quitters. Still at disadvantage because of the
close proximity?

1091
01:22:47,477 --> 01:22:48,657
MATT: Correct.

1092
01:22:48,657 --> 01:22:50,053
TALIESIN: Is his mouth open?

1093
01:22:50,053 --> 01:22:52,498
MATT: The mouth is currently slightly open.

1094
01:22:52,498 --> 01:22:56,908
TALIESIN: Am I close enough to start laying in a
few shots inside?

1095
01:22:56,908 --> 01:22:59,408
MATT: Maybe. You can certainly try.

1096
01:22:59,408 --> 01:23:06,812
TALIESIN: I'm going to lay in a couple shots
inside. Two more shots inside with Hex attack.

1097
01:23:06,812 --> 01:23:10,797
MARISHA: Hide behind his uvula, Grog!

1098
01:23:10,797 --> 01:23:17,869
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and go for the sides. If
I hit Grog, I don't care. He can take it. With

1099
01:23:17,869 --> 01:23:25,362
disadvantage, that's a jam on the Retort pistol.
Wait! No, that's a save reroll. Fuck my life.

1100
01:23:25,362 --> 01:23:30,771
Okay, so that's a jam, and one to try and fix it
really quickly, just trying to give it a clear,

1101
01:23:30,771 --> 01:23:32,931
with not disadvantage, because it doesn't matter.

1102
01:23:32,931 --> 01:23:34,442
MATT: What did you roll as the jam?

1103
01:23:34,442 --> 01:23:35,416
TALIESIN: One.

1104
01:23:35,416 --> 01:23:36,629
MATT: You rolled a natural one?

1105
01:23:36,629 --> 01:23:37,789
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1106
01:23:37,789 --> 01:23:39,454
MATT: Okay. Roll damage, anyway.

1107
01:23:39,454 --> 01:23:40,532
TALIESIN: Roll damage, anyway?

1108
01:23:40,532 --> 01:23:41,703
MATT: Yeah.

1109
01:23:41,703 --> 01:23:47,315
TALIESIN: I hate you.

1110
01:23:47,315 --> 01:23:52,013
MATT: Without the Hex damage bonus.

1111
01:23:52,013 --> 01:23:59,078
TALIESIN: That's ten points of damage.

1112
01:23:59,078 --> 01:24:04,714
MATT: Grog, you take ten points of piercing
damage.

1113
01:24:04,714 --> 01:24:06,606
TALIESIN: I don't have a jam?

1114
01:24:06,606 --> 01:24:08,889
MATT: But it does jam.

1115
01:24:08,889 --> 01:24:10,666
TALIESIN: Okay, so I'm going to do a clear.

1116
01:24:10,666 --> 01:24:15,180
MATT: So as you go to fire, it splinters off, and
there's a burst of smoke and the heat hurts your

1117
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:19,222
finger, and you hear this dull (impact) on the
inside and a (grunt).

1118
01:24:19,222 --> 01:24:20,750
TALIESIN: Sorry!

1119
01:24:20,750 --> 01:24:22,024
TRAVIS: It's halved, right?

1120
01:24:22,024 --> 01:24:23,219
MATT: It's halved, yes.

1121
01:24:23,219 --> 01:24:24,790
TALIESIN: One more shot.

1122
01:24:24,790 --> 01:24:28,561
MATT: This is to try and clear it, though. 
You still have to clear.

1123
01:24:28,561 --> 01:24:31,873
TALIESIN: I tried to clear. It clears. 
I hit 16 plus--

1124
01:24:31,873 --> 01:24:34,888
MATT: Okay, yeah, so you manage to get it cleared
and get it back and ready to go.

1125
01:24:34,888 --> 01:24:38,963
TALIESIN: I don't have a third shot, but now I'm
at least reloaded. Do I need another round to

1126
01:24:38,963 --> 01:24:41,905
reload, or does that count as a reload, a clear? 
I can never remember.

1127
01:24:41,905 --> 01:24:43,886
MATT: Using it as an attack is a reload.

1128
01:24:43,886 --> 01:24:49,969
TALIESIN: Okay, so I'll have to next turn. Okay,
I'll just call that clear. The last thing I'm

1129
01:24:49,969 --> 01:24:56,181
going to do is I'm going to move away from the
crocodile with all my strength, and I'm going to

1130
01:24:56,181 --> 01:24:59,903
say: everybody pull! And I'm backing up.

1131
01:24:59,903 --> 01:25:01,603
MATT: Make a strength check.

1132
01:25:01,603 --> 01:25:03,537
TALIESIN: This is going to be so sad.

1133
01:25:03,537 --> 01:25:05,397
MARISHA: Can we assist?

1134
01:25:05,397 --> 01:25:08,842
MATT: If you want to use an action on your next
turn to assist with this, then yes,

1135
01:25:08,842 --> 01:25:10,469
that'll be your action.

1136
01:25:10,469 --> 01:25:13,117
TALIESIN: It might be fine. Oh god.

1137
01:25:13,117 --> 01:25:15,629
ASHLEY: Come on, Percy!

1138
01:25:15,629 --> 01:25:19,107
TALIESIN: I have the worst strength. Eight.

1139
01:25:19,107 --> 01:25:28,950
MATT: Eight. As you say, "everyone push away!"
Your feet feebly glide against the muddy surface

1140
01:25:28,950 --> 01:25:38,118
of the riverbank as the jaws open slightly and
you hear the low, guttural (growling). The breath

1141
01:25:38,118 --> 01:25:47,194
comes pouring out into you in this strange
combination of muddy swamp low tide and compost.

1142
01:25:47,194 --> 01:25:48,780
It's delightful.

1143
01:25:48,780 --> 01:25:53,218
TALIESIN: We technically have our hands free and
are tied to the rope, so in theory we could still

1144
01:25:53,218 --> 01:25:57,703
use our hands and just try and all shift backwards
like stupid people.

1145
01:25:57,703 --> 01:26:00,973
MATT: But you're all mostly taut on the rope now.
So you can. That's what you tried to do, and it

1146
01:26:00,973 --> 01:26:11,115
failed miserably. That's your turn, Percy. Vax is
up now. Vax tries to push inward. Actually, no.

1147
01:26:11,115 --> 01:26:13,683
He's going to stay where he is out of range. He's
going to try and throw his daggers

1148
01:26:13,683 --> 01:26:14,987
from where he is.

1149
01:26:14,987 --> 01:26:16,349
LAURA: Come on, brother!

1150
01:26:16,349 --> 01:26:21,089
MATT: He is not going to use his haste boots,
though; he's going to save that for later. That's

1151
01:26:21,089 --> 01:26:30,081
two attacks; both hit. So with the first strike
and with the offhand throw. The first one with

1152
01:26:30,081 --> 01:26:35,051
sneak attack, because it is currently next to
Percy. You are threatening it at the moment.

1153
01:26:35,051 --> 01:26:37,388
TALIESIN: I hope I have its attention.

1154
01:26:37,388 --> 01:26:54,062
MATT: 28 points of damage, and the second strike
for a total of nine. So after Vax throws both

1155
01:26:54,062 --> 01:27:00,381
daggers, both sink into the sides of the giant
crocodile. It moves ever so slightly with the

1156
01:27:00,381 --> 01:27:04,190
first impact, the second one seemingly to no
effect. Both daggers appear in a puff of smoke to

1157
01:27:04,190 --> 01:27:07,880
the side of his belt and he looks to you and goes,
"Sister, what are we going to do?"

1158
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:09,509
LAURA: I don't know!

1159
01:27:09,509 --> 01:27:13,941
MATT: He can't really move at that point. It is
now Garmelie's turn.

1160
01:27:13,941 --> 01:27:17,501
LAURA: Oh, Garmelie!

1161
01:27:17,501 --> 01:27:22,652
MATT: Garmelie, who can't turn invisible, who
can't use his normal tactics, is just, "Um!"

1162
01:27:22,652 --> 01:27:26,383
LAURA: Sing a song, Garmelie! Charm him! Do
something!

1163
01:27:26,383 --> 01:27:37,882
MATT: He pulls up a small pan flute from his side
and (whistling). There's an awkward pause, and he

1164
01:27:37,882 --> 01:27:51,958
goes, "Shit!" He then tries to scoot away as far
as he can, but is once again caught between the

1165
01:27:51,958 --> 01:27:56,110
very taut sides of the rope, unable to shift. 
That brings us to Pike.

1166
01:27:56,110 --> 01:28:01,908
ASHLEY: Okay! How far are we from the disgusting
thing?

1167
01:28:01,908 --> 01:28:05,435
MATT: You guys are over here, so I'd say, from
what you can gauge here,

1168
01:28:05,435 --> 01:28:07,360
you're approximately 40 feet from it.

1169
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:12,029
ASHLEY: 40 feet? Great. So I'm going to get a
little bit closer.

1170
01:28:12,029 --> 01:28:16,070
MATT: You go right up to the edge of the water,
toes dipping in.

1171
01:28:16,070 --> 01:28:27,607
ASHLEY: I'm going to use my trusty old friend
Guiding Bolt. I'm going to Guiding Bolt his face.

1172
01:28:27,607 --> 01:28:31,481
MATT: Of course you are.

1173
01:28:31,481 --> 01:28:36,214
ASHLEY: And I'm going to do it at 5th-level,
because my best friend is in his belly!

1174
01:28:36,214 --> 01:28:41,508
SAM: Pike, I'm standing right next to you.

1175
01:28:41,508 --> 01:28:43,842
ASHLEY: I know.

1176
01:28:43,842 --> 01:29:00,601
MATT: So that is 8d6 damage if you hit. Go ahead
and roll your radiant attack against it.

1177
01:29:00,601 --> 01:29:02,573
Spell attack bonus. Roll a d20.

1178
01:29:02,573 --> 01:29:03,911
ASHLEY: Roll a d20?

1179
01:29:03,911 --> 01:29:06,154
MATT: Roll a d20, add your spell attack bonus,
yeah.

1180
01:29:06,154 --> 01:29:12,940
ASHLEY: Oh no. That's terrible. 15?

1181
01:29:12,940 --> 01:29:16,770
MATT: 15 just hits.

1182
01:29:16,770 --> 01:29:20,818
LAURA: How many d6s?

1183
01:29:20,818 --> 01:29:22,275
TRAVIS: She needs two more d6s.

1184
01:29:22,275 --> 01:29:23,715
LAURA: I have two more. Here we go.

1185
01:29:23,715 --> 01:29:27,882
MATT: So 8d6 points of radiant damage, and it is
currently marked for an advantage on the next

1186
01:29:27,882 --> 01:29:32,822
attack against it, as a giant bright light now
bursts across the front of its head, causing its

1187
01:29:32,822 --> 01:29:36,789
eyes to retract and close in pain. (snarling)

1188
01:29:36,789 --> 01:29:39,089
MARISHA: Come on. Big money, no whammies!

1189
01:29:39,089 --> 01:29:41,271
TRAVIS: There's math happening.

1190
01:29:41,271 --> 01:29:44,339
TALIESIN: It's really hard to count up here.

1191
01:29:44,339 --> 01:29:49,025
SAM: So exciting.

1192
01:29:49,025 --> 01:29:50,547
ASHLEY: 24.

1193
01:29:50,547 --> 01:29:59,830
MATT: 24. Not too shabby. 24 points of radiant
damage, and the glowing divine beacon now flashing

1194
01:29:59,830 --> 01:30:03,879
in the center of its face, causing it to close its
eyes. The next person that wants to make an attack

1195
01:30:03,879 --> 01:30:07,345
is going to have a nice little bonus. Is that the
end of your turn? You're going to stay right there

1196
01:30:07,345 --> 01:30:09,021
at the edge of the river?

1197
01:30:09,021 --> 01:30:12,997
ASHLEY: Yes.

1198
01:30:12,997 --> 01:30:15,350
MATT: Okay, that's the end of your turn, Pike.
Scanlan, you're up.

1199
01:30:15,350 --> 01:30:16,973
TRAVIS: Help me!

1200
01:30:16,973 --> 01:30:20,825
SAM: I can't!

1201
01:30:20,825 --> 01:30:22,508
TRAVIS: Oh, you're all the way over.

1202
01:30:22,508 --> 01:30:28,465
SAM: I'm across the river! I'm going to help
everyone else but you.

1203
01:30:28,465 --> 01:30:33,217
Can I inspire anyone over there?

1204
01:30:33,217 --> 01:30:35,436
MATT: They're within 60 feet.

1205
01:30:35,436 --> 01:30:41,653
SAM: Okay. I'll inspire Keyleth. I'll sing to her:
(singing) Believe it or not,

1206
01:30:41,773 --> 01:30:47,697
you're killing a croc! 
You never thought you could feel so free!

1207
01:30:47,697 --> 01:30:55,586
Slashing away on a giant fucking croc. 
How can it be?

1208
01:30:55,586 --> 01:30:58,849
Believe it or not, it's because of me!

1209
01:30:58,849 --> 01:31:06,208
(laughter and applause)

1210
01:31:06,208 --> 01:31:19,999
SAM: And I will take out my Wand of Magic Missiles
and fire many of them. I think if I use six

1211
01:31:19,999 --> 01:31:24,641
charges, that's eight darts.

1212
01:31:24,641 --> 01:31:26,835
MATT: That's a lot of missiles.

1213
01:31:26,835 --> 01:31:32,465
SAM: It's not very powerful, though, and I would
not like to shoot at the croc. I would like

1214
01:31:32,465 --> 01:31:35,849
to shoot at every segment of rope 
between every single person.

1215
01:31:35,849 --> 01:31:44,291
(cheering)

1216
01:31:44,291 --> 01:31:47,755
MATT: After the flash of the Guiding Bolt, the
rest of the party, you look across the way as you

1217
01:31:47,755 --> 01:31:53,579
see Scanlan, after singing this delightful song,
turn around Rambo-style and release this burst of

1218
01:31:53,579 --> 01:32:02,386
arcane energy. These arcane darts come firing
straight towards the croc, and in a moment of

1219
01:32:02,386 --> 01:32:06,393
excitement, expecting each of these impacts to
blast into the side of this creature, they

1220
01:32:06,393 --> 01:32:10,767
suddenly soar up into the sky and arc down 
towards each of you.

1221
01:32:10,767 --> 01:32:26,875
Before you have a moment to really react, the word
leaving your voice, "What?" They streak back down,

1222
01:32:26,875 --> 01:32:34,000
slamming into each side of the rope, causing it to
burst into frayed, burnt rope chunks and pieces of

1223
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:38,778
twine, all hanging loosely to your sides. All of
you guys are now free to move about as you wish.

1224
01:32:38,778 --> 01:32:52,897
SAM: And for my movement, I will grab Pike around
the waist and pull us back five feet off the edge

1225
01:32:52,897 --> 01:32:57,907
of the pond there. Thanks.

1226
01:32:57,907 --> 01:33:01,591
MATT: Well done. Top of the round again. 
Keyleth, you're up.

1227
01:33:01,591 --> 01:33:07,237
MARISHA: Okay! You have advantage 
on the next hit on it?

1228
01:33:07,237 --> 01:33:10,065
MATT: Anybody. Whoever has the next attack roll
against it has advantage.

1229
01:33:10,065 --> 01:33:26,719
MARISHA: I am going to cast 5th-level Blight on
him. He is a plant creature! I get how much extra?

1230
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:32,401
MATT: Well, it makes the saving throw with
disadvantage and the spell deals maximum damage

1231
01:33:32,401 --> 01:33:42,900
to it. So what's the spell DC of this?

1232
01:33:42,900 --> 01:33:44,692
MARISHA: 19.

1233
01:33:44,692 --> 01:33:46,792
SAM: Here's the big roll, guys.

1234
01:33:46,792 --> 01:33:52,249
MATT: 19. You can come look at it if you want to.

1235
01:33:52,249 --> 01:33:56,201
AUDIENCE: Disadvantage!

1236
01:33:56,201 --> 01:34:26,008
MATT: I understand. (chuckles) 15. This is going
to suck. So that is 64 points of necrotic damage.

1237
01:34:26,008 --> 01:34:41,005
MARISHA: I said, spit him out! That is caca! 
Spit it out!

1238
01:34:41,005 --> 01:34:46,478
MATT: As you clench your hand like this, you guys
watch as the roots that connect to its body

1239
01:34:46,478 --> 01:34:52,849
suddenly begin to wither and dry out. You watch as
the outside bark then cracks and turn to ash

1240
01:34:52,849 --> 01:34:59,539
and dust at its side, and its once verdant green
hide begins to curl into this dull gray, lifeless

1241
01:34:59,539 --> 01:35:06,655
husk. The creature's eyes spring open, and its
low, guttural growl turns to this horrible

1242
01:35:06,655 --> 01:35:11,834
shrieking pain sound. From the inside, Grog, you
feel everything tense around you as its form all

1243
01:35:11,834 --> 01:35:20,613
of a sudden is being drained of the life essence
and water that keeps it going. It manages to

1244
01:35:20,613 --> 01:35:30,246
recover, and the life pumps back into parts of it,
but that sucked. That is not a happy creature.

1245
01:35:30,246 --> 01:35:38,230
(applause)

1246
01:35:38,230 --> 01:35:44,992
MATT: Oh, that was fun to build the tension on
that one. All right, Keyleth, that's your action.

1247
01:35:44,992 --> 01:35:47,454
What else would you like to do for your turn?

1248
01:35:47,454 --> 01:35:54,199
MARISHA: I want to move and flank him a little bit
if I can. Get on his six. The other way.

1249
01:35:54,199 --> 01:35:57,485
MATT: All right, so you move past to this side.

1250
01:35:57,485 --> 01:36:00,548
MARISHA: That's good. Closer, a little bit, 
to him. One more closer.

1251
01:36:00,548 --> 01:36:02,118
MATT: Sure, closer's great.

1252
01:36:02,118 --> 01:36:06,057
MARISHA: No, back one! Back! No, it's fine.

1253
01:36:06,057 --> 01:36:13,117
MATT: Grog, you're up. You're currently still
constrained inside its body. The tautness of the

1254
01:36:13,117 --> 01:36:17,003
rope around your waist has gone slack, so in a
moment, you realize either your friends are dead,

1255
01:36:17,003 --> 01:36:22,735
or they managed to break the rope. You would think
that, if you weren't so full of anger and rage at

1256
01:36:22,735 --> 01:36:26,393
being shot and squeezed and devoured by a giant
crocodile. What are you doing?

1257
01:36:26,393 --> 01:36:28,724
TRAVIS: Can I reach the jug at all?

1258
01:36:28,724 --> 01:36:44,644
MATT: We'll say you can take your action to reach
into your Bag of Holding and pull it out, yes.

1259
01:36:44,644 --> 01:36:46,816
SAM: I thought he had it out already. It was on
his head, right?

1260
01:36:46,816 --> 01:36:49,398
MATT: Well, he had it out earlier. Have you had it
on your head this whole time?

1261
01:36:49,398 --> 01:36:53,350
TRAVIS: I had it tilted up so I could see.

1262
01:36:53,350 --> 01:37:01,374
MATT: If that was the case, the sheer force of the
creature biting you initially and throwing you

1263
01:37:01,374 --> 01:37:04,559
onto the bank would've tossed that jug quite a
ways away from you.

1264
01:37:04,559 --> 01:37:05,896
LAURA: Then it wasn't there.

1265
01:37:05,896 --> 01:37:08,596
TRAVIS: Yeah, we'll retcon that shit. 
It was in my pocket.

1266
01:37:08,596 --> 01:37:17,113
MATT: That's what I thought. So do you want to
spend your action to rummage through the Bag of

1267
01:37:17,113 --> 01:37:19,523
Holding and pull out the jar?

1268
01:37:19,523 --> 01:37:20,967
TRAVIS: And that's my action?

1269
01:37:20,967 --> 01:37:23,740
MATT: That would be your action, yes. You can use
your bonus action to attack

1270
01:37:23,740 --> 01:37:25,282
because you're in a frenzied rage.

1271
01:37:25,282 --> 01:37:26,941
TRAVIS: No, fuck it.

1272
01:37:26,941 --> 01:37:28,960
TALIESIN: You're still raging, too, 
because I hit you.

1273
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:31,571
TRAVIS: Yeah, but I can't hit anything. 
I'm like this.

1274
01:37:31,571 --> 01:37:35,932
MATT: You have disadvantage on your attacks. You
can still attack him from the inside.

1275
01:37:35,932 --> 01:37:41,371
TRAVIS: Can I take the Titanstone Knuckles, 
smash them together--

1276
01:37:41,371 --> 01:37:50,040
(cheering)

1277
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:56,280
TRAVIS: Can I cast Enlarge on myself?

1278
01:37:56,280 --> 01:38:02,870
MATT: You can certainly try. Is that what you want
to do?

1279
01:38:02,870 --> 01:38:04,907
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll try that.

1280
01:38:04,907 --> 01:38:11,496
MATT: As your mind is suddenly clouded with the
thought of, "Jug! I need to get the jug... No."

1281
01:38:11,496 --> 01:38:21,805
You feel your body, your physical form begin to
ripple and swell. You guys watch as the crocodile,

1282
01:38:21,805 --> 01:38:26,823
now currently recovering from the blight-like
withering of its form, suddenly its eyes go wide

1283
01:38:26,823 --> 01:38:37,617
once more as its gullet begins to swell wider and
wider. You hear this low (retching), like a cat

1284
01:38:37,617 --> 01:38:59,835
coughing up a hairball slowed down, as you watch
an enlarged Grog get immediately vomited up

1285
01:38:59,835 --> 01:39:01,715
and out of the creature to its side.

1286
01:39:01,715 --> 01:39:04,241
SAM: His favored terrain is vomit.

1287
01:39:04,241 --> 01:39:09,809
MATT: Yes, you do have benefits to that. So yes.
You manage to do that, sir.

1288
01:39:09,809 --> 01:39:16,301
TRAVIS: So I get puked out. Can I use whatever
movement speed I have left to drag the daisy chain

1289
01:39:16,301 --> 01:39:18,668
with me away from the crocodile?

1290
01:39:18,668 --> 01:39:21,621
MATT: Okay. As you rush away, he gets an attack of
opportunity on you.

1291
01:39:21,621 --> 01:39:24,037
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. It got separated.

1292
01:39:24,037 --> 01:39:29,843
MATT: It does have disadvantage because you shot
it last turn. Which is good, because the second

1293
01:39:29,843 --> 01:39:34,129
roll was a natural 20. That's a total of 20 to
hit. What's your armor class?

1294
01:39:34,129 --> 01:39:35,382
TRAVIS: 20.

1295
01:39:35,382 --> 01:39:37,036
MATT: Okay, so it just hits you with the bite.

1296
01:39:37,036 --> 01:39:42,270
SAM: Can I Cutting Words him?

1297
01:39:42,270 --> 01:39:44,922
MATT: You do have a reaction, so yes, you may.

1298
01:39:44,922 --> 01:40:01,039
SAM: Okay. I will Cutting Words him. I'll say:
Mm-Grog (vocalizing) Grog (vocalizing). Yeah!

1299
01:40:01,039 --> 01:40:03,973
It's supposed to distract him.

1300
01:40:03,973 --> 01:40:11,385
MATT: Yeah, it's not inspiring somebody. It is
intended to distract the opponent. And this

1301
01:40:11,385 --> 01:40:21,421
crocodile, probably having a rather rough time in
the early 2000s, manages to provide even more bile

1302
01:40:21,421 --> 01:40:26,355
from its stomach at the sound of a rehashed Hanson
song. Go ahead and make your roll.

1303
01:40:26,355 --> 01:40:27,610
SAM: What do I roll?

1304
01:40:27,610 --> 01:40:30,345
MATT: You roll your inspiration die.

1305
01:40:30,345 --> 01:40:31,446
SAM: Eight.

1306
01:40:31,446 --> 01:40:32,922
MATT: No, it's a d10.

1307
01:40:32,922 --> 01:40:34,690
SAM: d10? Eight.

1308
01:40:34,690 --> 01:40:42,138
MATT: You were intent on that happening. As it
reaches out to try and bite towards Grog, it hears

1309
01:40:42,138 --> 01:40:48,462
the sound and its head quirks, vomits a little.
Grog, you manage to get away, at that point, we'll

1310
01:40:48,462 --> 01:40:53,531
say about that far. As you turn around, the daisy
chain has not followed you. Glancing down, the

1311
01:40:53,531 --> 01:40:58,541
rope that was once around your waist has snapped
by the growth in size, and all the rest of the

1312
01:40:58,541 --> 01:41:01,001
ropes have also been snapped. Sorry.

1313
01:41:01,001 --> 01:41:03,726
LAURA: Hey, you're out!

1314
01:41:03,726 --> 01:41:14,153
MATT: Perfect. That ends your turn. It is now the
croc's turn. It's going to make a bite attack

1315
01:41:14,153 --> 01:41:18,211
right now. This is going to be at Percy, since
you're right there in front of him.

1316
01:41:18,211 --> 01:41:19,662
TALIESIN: Bring it!

1317
01:41:19,662 --> 01:41:24,893
SAM: Don't worry. I won't sing Hanson again.

1318
01:41:24,893 --> 01:41:29,679
MATT: With disadvantage, that is a 23.

1319
01:41:29,679 --> 01:41:31,375
TALIESIN: That hits.

1320
01:41:31,375 --> 01:41:37,348
MATT: That hits you. All right, as the head turns
back towards you, it opens to the side

1321
01:41:37,348 --> 01:41:39,103
and tries to clamp on you.

1322
01:41:39,103 --> 01:41:44,509
TALIESIN: I'm using my new fancy counter.

1323
01:41:44,509 --> 01:41:45,909
MARISHA: Yeah, your counter ring.

1324
01:41:45,909 --> 01:41:47,709
TALIESIN: I'm so excited to take damage.

1325
01:41:47,709 --> 01:41:49,910
MATT: That is a 34.

1326
01:41:49,910 --> 01:41:54,007
TALIESIN: I'm not that excited to take damage.
34?

1327
01:41:54,007 --> 01:42:01,507
MATT: 34 points of piercing damage, and you are
currently grappled and restrained.

1328
01:42:01,507 --> 01:42:03,971
TALIESIN: Grappled and restrained.

1329
01:42:03,971 --> 01:42:07,083
MARISHA: Wait, he's in the crocodile's mouth now?

1330
01:42:07,083 --> 01:42:09,920
MATT: The crocodile has now snapped, its jaws
moving to Percy, and Percy, you're currently held

1331
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:15,677
tight in its jaws. It's trying to lift you up now,
possibly to fill its now terribly empty stomach.

1332
01:42:15,677 --> 01:42:24,276
It lost more than it originally started this
battle with. As it swings around its tail, in

1333
01:42:24,276 --> 01:42:34,664
doing so, its stinger sweeps overhead. It has a
reach of ten at this point. We'll say in that arc

1334
01:42:34,664 --> 01:42:44,593
there. This is going to be towards Vex. Towards you
Vex, with disadvantage. Still, that's a 21.

1335
01:42:44,593 --> 01:42:46,027
What's your armor class?

1336
01:42:46,027 --> 01:42:47,811
LAURA: Fuck! I mean, 20.

1337
01:42:47,811 --> 01:42:51,848
MATT: 20, okay, so it still hits you. All right,
so the stinger (whipcrack) grinds itself into your

1338
01:42:51,848 --> 01:42:57,242
flesh, tears through the armor separation there,
and you can feel pulsing. I need you to go ahead

1339
01:42:57,242 --> 01:43:00,438
and make a constitution saving throw.

1340
01:43:00,438 --> 01:43:02,857
LAURA: Because that's my strength.

1341
01:43:02,857 --> 01:43:05,910
TALIESIN: You got this.

1342
01:43:05,910 --> 01:43:07,082
LAURA: Do I?

1343
01:43:07,082 --> 01:43:08,346
TALIESIN: You do.

1344
01:43:08,346 --> 01:43:10,180
LAURA: Ten!

1345
01:43:10,180 --> 01:43:18,164
MATT: Well, you take 16 points of piercing damage
from the actual stinger itself striking you. You

1346
01:43:18,164 --> 01:43:23,525
now feel that pulse of venom through your body,
and as it begins to swell through you, you feel

1347
01:43:23,525 --> 01:43:29,796
all the colors and all the images of the landscape
around you begin to shift and bubble and move.

1348
01:43:29,796 --> 01:43:31,464
MARISHA: You're tripping, man.

1349
01:43:31,464 --> 01:43:39,304
MATT: You are tripping balls right now. You look 
to your left and see Garmelie next to you,

1350
01:43:39,304 --> 01:43:43,768
whose frightened expression becomes suddenly 
this giant feral wolverine that hisses at you!

1351
01:43:43,768 --> 01:43:47,802
You look to your right, and you see the giant 
crocodile holding Percy suddenly merge

1352
01:43:47,802 --> 01:43:52,628
into one strange, giant Medusa creature. 
You don't know which way is up and down,

1353
01:43:52,628 --> 01:43:55,077
and you are extremely frightened and confused.

1354
01:43:55,077 --> 01:43:59,283
MARISHA: You're frightened? 
Oh no, it's a bad trip.

1355
01:43:59,283 --> 01:44:07,710
LAURA: Does that mean I lose my turn?

1356
01:44:07,710 --> 01:44:16,053
MATT: Well, that ends the crocodile's turn, and it
is now your turn. Currently, you cannot take

1357
01:44:16,053 --> 01:44:20,988
reactions, and I need you to roll a d8
to see what you do.

1358
01:44:20,988 --> 01:44:24,595
SAM: Wait, it could be anything?

1359
01:44:24,595 --> 01:44:31,308
MATT: (chuckles) You're so stunned by this moment,
and your brain being completely turned around.

1360
01:44:31,346 --> 01:44:32,794
What did you roll?

1361
01:44:32,794 --> 01:44:34,090
LAURA: I rolled a five.

1362
01:44:34,090 --> 01:44:40,481
MATT: Roll of five. Okay. You take no action, and
you use all of your movement to move in a random

1363
01:44:40,481 --> 01:44:56,195
direction. You go into the river. You turn around
and begin to flee. Looking ahead of you, you see

1364
01:44:56,195 --> 01:45:03,300
what seems to be a moving sea of grass, and all of
a sudden you feel your feet (splashing). The river

1365
01:45:03,300 --> 01:45:05,833
begins to pull you away at the end of your turn.

1366
01:45:05,833 --> 01:45:09,288
MARISHA: Son of a bitch. Oh shit.

1367
01:45:09,288 --> 01:45:12,280
LAURA: Bye!

1368
01:45:12,280 --> 01:45:15,609
MATT: Make another constitution saving throw.

1369
01:45:15,609 --> 01:45:18,918
LAURA: Oh, good. Okay. Oh, natural 20!

1370
01:45:18,918 --> 01:45:27,553
ASHLEY: She turns back time.

1371
01:45:27,553 --> 01:45:32,891
MATT: As soon as your vision comes back to you and
a breath of relief hits your form as suddenly you

1372
01:45:32,891 --> 01:45:39,049
have control of your form. As it begins to be
sucked under the water. End of your turn.

1373
01:45:39,049 --> 01:45:40,549
Percy, you're up.

1374
01:45:40,549 --> 01:45:44,787
TALIESIN: So I'm grappled. 
There's nothing I can do.

1375
01:45:44,787 --> 01:45:47,920
MATT: You're restrained. You can attack. You can't
move, and all your attacks have disadvantage.

1376
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:52,460
TALIESIN: And everything I have, at least at the
moment, anything with a gun is at disadvantage.

1377
01:45:52,460 --> 01:45:58,030
Oh, but I've got Hex on him, so even if I hit him
with a sword, it's an extra d6. I'm going to try

1378
01:45:58,030 --> 01:46:09,422
and start hacking him to let me go. Ooh! Weird
question. If I use the drop-it effect, the grit

1379
01:46:09,422 --> 01:46:12,338
drop an item, can I get him to drop me, 
as an item?

1380
01:46:12,338 --> 01:46:14,889
MATT: I don't think you count as an item,
I'm sorry.

1381
01:46:14,889 --> 01:46:19,847
TALIESIN: Sticking him in the jaw, I can't get him
to? I can't make him roll to drop?

1382
01:46:19,847 --> 01:46:22,775
MATT: I don't think that's how it works. It's not
like you hit a couple fingers and they drop a cup.

1383
01:46:22,775 --> 01:46:25,686
This is a massive muscle currently clamped on you,
trying to swallow you.

1384
01:46:25,686 --> 01:46:26,902
TALIESIN: I was hoping.

1385
01:46:26,902 --> 01:46:28,121
MATT: I know. Sorry.

1386
01:46:28,121 --> 01:46:34,740
TALIESIN: Okay, in that case, I'm going to grab my
sword and start hacking at him.

1387
01:46:34,740 --> 01:46:38,573
MATT: Okay, so we'll say you use your bonus action
to draw your weapon. It's right there by your

1388
01:46:38,573 --> 01:46:41,910
side. You pull it out. Go ahead and make your
attacks against the crocodile.

1389
01:46:41,910 --> 01:46:47,038
TALIESIN: Okay, that's a 15?

1390
01:46:47,038 --> 01:46:49,072
MATT: 15 just barely hits.

1391
01:46:49,072 --> 01:46:51,464
SAM: Okay. You had advantage on them.

1392
01:46:51,464 --> 01:46:53,943
TALIESIN: Did I? No, I don't have advantage 
for these.

1393
01:46:53,943 --> 01:46:58,827
MATT: Actually, technically it would have been the
first attack since Pike's Guiding Bolt. Thank you

1394
01:46:58,827 --> 01:47:01,098
for the reminder of that. So it would've been a
normal attack.

1395
01:47:01,098 --> 01:47:02,747
TALIESIN: That was the first attack since her
Guiding Bolt?

1396
01:47:02,747 --> 01:47:04,168
MARISHA: No, I thought I attacked.

1397
01:47:04,168 --> 01:47:08,724
MATT: Yours didn't have a spell attack, it just
instantly hit and made a save. So technically,

1398
01:47:08,724 --> 01:47:10,136
what was your first roll?

1399
01:47:10,136 --> 01:47:11,309
TALIESIN: 15.

1400
01:47:11,309 --> 01:47:12,424
MATT: Yeah, you hit.

1401
01:47:12,424 --> 01:47:16,207
TALIESIN: Okay. The next roll wasn't a 20, so it
doesn't matter, anyway.

1402
01:47:16,207 --> 01:47:20,717
MATT: The Guiding Bolt wears off. However, that
did manage to get rid of the disadvantage on that

1403
01:47:20,717 --> 01:47:25,118
one strike. Seeing the bright side of its face,
you take your blade out and hack downward for the

1404
01:47:25,118 --> 01:47:29,189
first hit, which does strike true across the side
of its face. You can make your next two attacks.

1405
01:47:29,189 --> 01:47:31,424
TALIESIN: That's 28.

1406
01:47:31,424 --> 01:47:32,956
MATT Those do have disadvantage.

1407
01:47:32,956 --> 01:47:39,198
TALIESIN: Okay, in that case, natural 20. Oh, it
has disadvantage, though, so it's still the 28.

1408
01:47:39,198 --> 01:47:49,060
SAM: Matt, if I can be a stickler, I also Cutting
Wordsed him, so that puts him at disadvantage

1409
01:47:49,060 --> 01:47:50,941
on a save.

1410
01:47:50,941 --> 01:47:55,255
MATT: On his next saving throw, but he's not
making a saving throw.

1411
01:47:55,255 --> 01:47:57,930
SAM: This is a kangaroo court!

1412
01:47:57,930 --> 01:48:01,748
MATT: And if I'm going to be a stickler here, Sam.
The next time he has a saving throw,

1413
01:48:01,748 --> 01:48:03,807
I'll keep the disadvantage in mind.

1414
01:48:03,807 --> 01:48:08,972
LAURA: Oh, you're in trouble, Samuel.

1415
01:48:08,972 --> 01:48:19,397
TALIESIN: All right, so that hit, and then for my
last one... That's not bad. 21.

1416
01:48:19,397 --> 01:48:22,643
MATT: Yeah, all three strikes hit. Go ahead and
roll damage on all those.

1417
01:48:22,643 --> 01:48:28,104
TALIESIN: Let me get my new d8. That's super. 
Oh, I can get all my d8s. And then 3d6 for some

1418
01:48:28,104 --> 01:48:50,807
necrotic damage. So that's 13 points of necrotic
damage and 37 points of slashing damage.

1419
01:48:50,807 --> 01:48:54,958
MARISHA: Kill it!

1420
01:48:54,958 --> 01:49:00,414
MATT: Slamming into the side of its face, you
begin splitting open a section of the side of its

1421
01:49:00,414 --> 01:49:04,185
head. You can see its cracked, withered form from
the Blight spell earlier has become a little more

1422
01:49:04,185 --> 01:49:07,932
brittle, and each impact is cutting deeper than
any of the previous hits has.

1423
01:49:07,932 --> 01:49:16,512
We're going to take a quick break here. 
Five, ten-minute break to use the restroom,

1424
01:49:16,512 --> 01:49:21,298
and return to the apex of this battle.

1425
01:49:21,298 --> 01:57:30,940
[break]

1426
01:57:30,979 --> 01:57:34,368
TRAVIS: Is this for me? Motherfuckers!

1427
01:57:34,368 --> 01:57:36,764
LAURA: You're so low.

1428
01:57:36,764 --> 01:57:44,061
TALIESIN: Oh, god, that game again.

1429
01:57:44,061 --> 01:57:54,585
LAURA: Grog? It's all for Grog? 
Is it just for you?

1430
01:57:54,585 --> 01:57:56,316
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1431
01:57:56,316 --> 01:58:06,046
MATT: So on Vax's turn... Vax is going to go ahead
and dart around this way, behind Garmelie, getting

1432
01:58:06,046 --> 01:58:09,063
to where Trinket is flanking along the river bend
there.

1433
01:58:09,063 --> 01:58:10,865
LAURA: Oh, are we just right back in?

1434
01:58:10,865 --> 01:58:16,420
MATT: As he does pull out of the range of the
tail, the croc can go ahead and make an attack of

1435
01:58:16,420 --> 01:58:22,343
opportunity with the stinger out towards him
behind. That is not going to hit, that is a

1436
01:58:22,343 --> 01:58:26,772
natural four. That's going to be like a 16, so
yeah. As it swings with its tail wide to Vax, Vax

1437
01:58:26,772 --> 01:58:31,433
ducks beneath it, arms up to the side, leaps in
the air and catches himself right on the edge of

1438
01:58:31,433 --> 01:58:34,087
the bank. He looks over and notices you, running
off to the side.

1439
01:58:34,087 --> 01:58:37,705
LAURA: Me! Me, help me.

1440
01:58:37,705 --> 01:58:44,758
MATT: Immediately decides to put his daggers back
away, and then uses a dash action to dart over to

1441
01:58:44,758 --> 01:58:49,149
the edge of the river where you are, and is going
to reach out and try and grab your arms. You guys

1442
01:58:49,149 --> 01:58:52,602
are reaching for each other right now. That is how
it's going to go for this moment. That brings us

1443
01:58:52,602 --> 01:58:57,071
to Garmelie, who now, free of the rope
circumstance and the chaos around, looks and sees

1444
01:58:57,071 --> 01:59:05,043
you out in the river, scoots around, goes out
with, grabs your brother's arm and then reaches

1445
01:59:05,043 --> 01:59:08,163
out towards your arm and chains his way towards
you, putting his hand towards you.

1446
01:59:08,163 --> 01:59:09,463
LAURA: Garmelie's helping!

1447
01:59:09,463 --> 01:59:10,660
MARISHA: Garmelie!

1448
01:59:10,660 --> 01:59:11,577
MATT: "Grab!"

1449
01:59:11,577 --> 01:59:12,492
LAURA: Okay!

1450
01:59:12,492 --> 01:59:14,219
TALIESIN: It's a sign he's going to turn on us 
at any moment.

1451
01:59:14,219 --> 01:59:15,277
LAURA: I know.

1452
01:59:15,277 --> 01:59:18,127
MATT: So you guys grab and link arms. At that
point he's going to go ahead and make a strength

1453
01:59:18,127 --> 01:59:24,184
check to pull you out of the roaring rapids. Okay.
He manages to hold in the moment, but doesn't

1454
01:59:24,184 --> 01:59:28,525
actually get any ground on pulling you out of the
river, so now it's just him and Vax holding you at

1455
01:59:28,525 --> 01:59:33,610
the edge. The river's pulling you harder and
harder, and you can feel the actual swell getting

1456
01:59:33,610 --> 01:59:37,906
stronger, but they're still managing to keep you
in place. That ends his turn. Pike, you're up.

1457
01:59:37,906 --> 01:59:45,695
ASHLEY: Okay. How is the monster crocodile plant
doing? Is he looking rough?

1458
01:59:45,695 --> 01:59:48,099
MATT: He's looking hurt.

1459
01:59:48,099 --> 01:59:49,781
ASHLEY: Is he regenerating himself?

1460
01:59:49,781 --> 01:59:54,121
MATT: You've noticed each time it's had a moment
to itself, its roots have dug in and it's pulled

1461
01:59:54,121 --> 01:59:58,925
back into its form, yeah. It has been still
regenerating every round, yes.

1462
01:59:58,925 --> 02:00:00,425
ASHLEY: That's bullshit.

1463
02:00:00,425 --> 02:00:03,433
TRAVIS: It really is.

1464
02:00:03,433 --> 02:00:10,850
ASHLEY: You know what? I'm going to hold off on
that then. No, you know what?

1465
02:00:10,850 --> 02:00:14,186
I'm going to Flame Strike him.

1466
02:00:14,186 --> 02:00:18,005
MATT: What are you doing on him?

1467
02:00:18,005 --> 02:00:21,944
ASHLEY: Just the old Flame Strike.

1468
02:00:21,944 --> 02:00:27,277
MATT: Sure. All righty. Where do you want that
Flame Strike to land?

1469
02:00:27,277 --> 02:00:30,151
ASHLEY: Just on his whole body.

1470
02:00:30,151 --> 02:00:36,775
MATT: Wherever you see it, 
onto the middle of its body.

1471
02:00:36,775 --> 02:00:42,273
ASHLEY: Oh, where do I want to see it? 
Maybe his torso area.

1472
02:00:42,273 --> 02:00:46,479
LAURA: Where it won't hurt anybody else around.

1473
02:00:46,479 --> 02:00:52,821
MATT: As you look over in the distance, unable
to really see beyond the form of the creature, you

1474
02:00:52,821 --> 02:00:57,108
bring the Flame Strike down onto its form. It's
going to make a saving throw with disadvantage

1475
02:00:57,108 --> 02:01:05,213
because of your Cutting Words, which is good
because it rolled a 17 for the first one. And it

1476
02:01:05,213 --> 02:01:11,720
rolled a 15 for the second one. No dex bonus for
it because it's not very fast. Your DC is?

1477
02:01:11,720 --> 02:01:13,055
ASHLEY: 18.

1478
02:01:13,055 --> 02:01:21,043
MATT: 18, yes. 8d6 radiant damage. 
Go ahead and roll that.

1479
02:01:21,043 --> 02:01:23,947
LAURA: Wait, here's some more d6. Take them.

1480
02:01:23,947 --> 02:01:31,503
MATT: That's a ten-foot radius. I'll say for the
sake of knowledge in the area, too, and seeing

1481
02:01:31,503 --> 02:01:35,406
Trinket attack, you manage to pull it out of the
range of the bear, not wanting to ignite him.

1482
02:01:35,406 --> 02:01:43,845
Scanlan, you're up next.

1483
02:01:43,845 --> 02:01:46,198
SAM: Yeah, I know.

1484
02:01:46,198 --> 02:01:54,970
MATT: How much fire and divine damage?

1485
02:01:54,970 --> 02:01:57,186
ASHLEY: 28.

1486
02:01:57,186 --> 02:02:04,414
MATT: 28 points of damage. As you guys see this
gathering of small reddish and white divine

1487
02:02:04,414 --> 02:02:12,234
particles circle in the air, faster and faster,
and then (boom) a column of divine flame strikes

1488
02:02:12,234 --> 02:02:17,975
from the heavens, blasting into the side of this
creature. It rears back (roars) in pain as you see

1489
02:02:17,975 --> 02:02:24,278
now its slightly withered, blight-impacted
grayish-green back is now burnt to a black crisp,

1490
02:02:24,278 --> 02:02:29,328
and smoke begins to rise off of its form. 
It's very pissed off.

1491
02:02:29,328 --> 02:02:30,835
TRAVIS: Monster!

1492
02:02:30,835 --> 02:02:34,135
MATT: Is that the end of your turn, Pike? 
Are you going to stay where you are?

1493
02:02:34,135 --> 02:02:38,645
ASHLEY: How's everybody doing?

1494
02:02:38,645 --> 02:02:41,309
TALIESIN: I'm a little iffy, but I'm okay.

1495
02:02:41,309 --> 02:02:47,062
ASHLEY: You're a little iffy? Yeah, I want to
Healing Word Percy.

1496
02:02:47,062 --> 02:02:52,186
MATT: What's the range on it?

1497
02:02:52,186 --> 02:02:54,973
ASHLEY: 60 feet.

1498
02:02:54,973 --> 02:02:58,090
MATT: 60 feet? Yeah, you can get to him 
from there.

1499
02:02:58,090 --> 02:02:59,492
ASHLEY: Okay.

1500
02:02:59,492 --> 02:03:08,358
LAURA: I don't know. So you heal him.

1501
02:03:08,358 --> 02:03:10,614
ASHLEY: All right, so I'll heal him.

1502
02:03:10,614 --> 02:03:18,599
MATT: So you're casting Healing Word 
at second level?

1503
02:03:18,599 --> 02:03:20,590
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1504
02:03:20,590 --> 02:03:22,326
MATT: Go for it. Roll the dice.

1505
02:03:22,326 --> 02:03:26,310
TALIESIN: What is that? How many-- 
oh, she's rolling dice.

1506
02:03:26,310 --> 02:03:31,544
ASHLEY: 19.

1507
02:03:31,544 --> 02:03:33,454
TALIESIN: 19. That's nice.

1508
02:03:33,454 --> 02:03:38,316
MATT: All right. Scanlan, you're up.

1509
02:03:38,316 --> 02:03:42,590
SAM: Okay. I don't know, man.

1510
02:03:42,590 --> 02:03:48,449
MATT: Real fast, Pike. That was 2d4 plus five?

1511
02:03:48,449 --> 02:03:53,260
ASHLEY: Oh, isn't it my spellcasting modifier?

1512
02:03:53,260 --> 02:03:55,970
MATT: No, just add plus five.

1513
02:03:55,970 --> 02:04:00,802
ASHLEY: Okay, so then it would be 13, 
because I rolled two fours.

1514
02:04:00,802 --> 02:04:02,480
MATT: All right. Scanlan, what are you doing?

1515
02:04:02,480 --> 02:04:06,445
SAM: Is it a large creature? I know it's large,
but how large?

1516
02:04:06,445 --> 02:04:11,247
MATT: It would be classified as a huge creature.

1517
02:04:11,247 --> 02:04:21,412
SAM: Okay. Well, then forget that. Okay, I'm going
to Eyebite him with my eyes of craziness. Put up

1518
02:04:21,412 --> 02:04:28,094
the hand cone, and I'm going to try 
to make him sick.

1519
02:04:28,094 --> 02:04:38,073
MATT: All righty, so let's take its wisdom saving
throw against your DC. That is a six with no

1520
02:04:38,073 --> 02:04:48,526
modifier. It is certainly sickened, though its
disadvantage has worn off, of course.

1521
02:04:48,526 --> 02:04:50,994
TALIESIN: There's so many rings on it. 
It's great.

1522
02:04:50,994 --> 02:05:00,862
SAM: And I won't really move, but I will inspire
Grog, because he needs to hit something, man.

1523
02:05:00,862 --> 02:05:02,393
TRAVIS: I'm telling you.

1524
02:05:02,393 --> 02:05:05,399
SAM: I'll inspire him with a limerick.

1525
02:05:05,399 --> 02:05:14,997
A warning from your favorite bard:
In the Feywild, you should be on guard.

1526
02:05:14,997 --> 02:05:19,276
I went off to take a shitter,
and saw, like, a thousand Critters.

1527
02:05:19,276 --> 02:05:28,622
(cheering)

1528
02:05:28,622 --> 02:05:34,436
SAM: And they kind of made me hard!

1529
02:05:34,436 --> 02:05:47,518
(cheering)

1530
02:05:47,518 --> 02:05:51,882
MATT: Take your inspiration die, Grog. 
All right, staying where you are, Scanlan?

1531
02:05:51,882 --> 02:05:54,037
SAM: Staying where I am.

1532
02:05:54,037 --> 02:05:55,192
MATT: Keyleth, you're up.

1533
02:05:55,192 --> 02:06:04,146
MARISHA: Oh! It's me! Oh dear god. Okay. I am
going to do what worked really well last time, and

1534
02:06:04,146 --> 02:06:09,442
I'm going to do a 4th-level Blight. And what I
want to do is, I want to take my staff, because

1535
02:06:09,442 --> 02:06:10,684
I'm near him, right?

1536
02:06:10,684 --> 02:06:11,757
MATT: You are.

1537
02:06:11,757 --> 02:06:16,909
MARISHA: Okay, I want to take my staff, and where
Pike put that nice little crispy donut hole in the

1538
02:06:16,909 --> 02:06:24,347
middle of him, I want to take my staff right in
the middle and bring it down and cast Blight.

1539
02:06:24,347 --> 02:06:31,163
MATT: All righty. Saving throw against the DC with
disadvantage. A six and an eight.

1540
02:06:31,163 --> 02:06:39,741
(laughter and applause)

1541
02:06:39,741 --> 02:06:41,662
MATT: How do you want to do this?

1542
02:06:41,662 --> 02:07:11,641
(cheering and chanting "Keyleth")

1543
02:07:11,641 --> 02:07:14,120
MARISHA: That's the coolest thing 
that's ever happened to me.

1544
02:07:14,120 --> 02:07:19,224
MATT: You hear the phantom chanting in the back of
your head. How do you want to do this?

1545
02:07:19,224 --> 02:07:24,399
MARISHA: My ego loves this. Is Percy still in his
mouth?

1546
02:07:24,399 --> 02:07:26,427
MATT: Percy is still in its mouth, yes.

1547
02:07:26,427 --> 02:07:32,354
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to say: Stop putting
foreign objects in your mouth!

1548
02:07:32,354 --> 02:07:42,022
MATT: As you slam your staff into the ground with
a giant ripple, all of a sudden you watch as the

1549
02:07:42,022 --> 02:07:46,731
various plant growth in the ground begins to turn
to a dark black gray at the base of the staff. It

1550
02:07:46,731 --> 02:07:53,505
curls across the ground, like the actual line of
blighted death and decay seems to spear out

1551
02:07:53,505 --> 02:07:59,051
across. It manages to catch the bottom and sink up
the roots of the creature. As it begins to swell

1552
02:07:59,051 --> 02:08:02,730
up into its body, you see it taking form. 
How do you want the Blight spell

1553
02:08:02,730 --> 02:08:04,511
to take hold in its body?

1554
02:08:04,511 --> 02:08:15,166
MARISHA: It takes hold? Okay. How about this? 
You know the petrified forests in Arizona?

1555
02:08:15,166 --> 02:08:18,614
Can I petrify him?

1556
02:08:18,614 --> 02:08:24,374
MATT: All right, so as the Blight spell spirals
across his body like a spider web, crackling, it

1557
02:08:24,374 --> 02:08:30,481
begins to (snarl). It rears up with its arms out
in front of it taut, the muscles locking up like

1558
02:08:30,481 --> 02:08:34,635
this giant arching statue, its jaws up in the air
holding Percy aloft.

1559
02:08:34,635 --> 02:08:42,832
(laughter)

1560
02:08:42,832 --> 02:08:47,902
MATT: You hear the scraping and cracking of bark
and dried plant matter, its entire form slightly

1561
02:08:47,902 --> 02:08:53,871
squeaking as it becomes a solid, petrified piece
of plant matter, the life force now drained from

1562
02:08:53,871 --> 02:08:59,059
it. The roots at its sides crack and turn to ash.
Part of its form tends to sink to one side of the

1563
02:08:59,059 --> 02:09:05,851
mud, and now this once very dangerous-looking
creature is solid, dead plant matter, holding a

1564
02:09:05,851 --> 02:09:07,950
wiggling and very unhappy human.

1565
02:09:07,950 --> 02:09:19,013
(cheering)

1566
02:09:19,013 --> 02:09:21,693
MARISHA: Hey, Percy! 
How's the weather up there?

1567
02:09:21,693 --> 02:09:25,952
TALIESIN: Ow!

1568
02:09:25,952 --> 02:09:29,934
LAURA: I would be cheering for you if I wasn't
drowning at this very moment.

1569
02:09:29,934 --> 02:09:33,842
MATT: On that note, too, I need you 
to make a strength check.

1570
02:09:33,842 --> 02:09:44,150
LAURA: Oh. Well, that's a 15 there. 
Actually, that's a straight check.

1571
02:09:44,150 --> 02:09:45,850
That's not a saving throw?

1572
02:09:45,850 --> 02:09:46,885
MATT: Right, just a check.

1573
02:09:46,885 --> 02:09:48,155
LAURA: 13.

1574
02:09:48,155 --> 02:09:57,453
MATT: (chuckles) You and Vax and Garmelie still
hold your ground, but unfortunately, not a whole

1575
02:09:57,453 --> 02:10:00,555
lot of physical strength in this daisy chain right
now.

1576
02:10:00,555 --> 02:10:03,519
LAURA: Can I ask Trinket to come up and help?

1577
02:10:03,519 --> 02:10:10,771
MATT: You can, yes. And Trinket rushes over.
(moans) Comes up behind Vax and bites the back of

1578
02:10:10,771 --> 02:10:17,421
his cloak and begins tugging on him as he's now
being slightly strangled by the bear. Pulled back

1579
02:10:17,421 --> 02:10:22,053
toward Trinket, adding his strength to that. 
What's Trinket's strength bonus?

1580
02:10:22,053 --> 02:10:28,903
LAURA: Yeah. Four! He's stronger than me.

1581
02:10:28,903 --> 02:10:34,964
MATT: With a roll of a 17, that brings it to a 21.
Whereas you began to pull them in towards the

1582
02:10:34,964 --> 02:10:39,662
river, Trinket makes up the back end of it and
manages to drag all of you out of the wake, onto

1583
02:10:39,662 --> 02:10:53,004
the side. As you get up and cough out the water,
Trinket comes up to you and nuzzles you

1584
02:10:53,004 --> 02:10:54,872
on the side of your face.

1585
02:10:54,872 --> 02:10:56,243
LAURA: Thanks, buddy.

1586
02:10:56,243 --> 02:10:57,778
MATT: (moans)

1587
02:10:57,778 --> 02:11:03,932
LAURA: I get up and hug Garmelie. What! You saved
me. You're wonderful.

1588
02:11:03,932 --> 02:11:10,203
MATT: "What was I supposed to do, watch you drown?
No! We're almost to the end of our agreement."

1589
02:11:10,203 --> 02:11:17,481
LAURA: I tousle his hair. Good job, Keyleth!

1590
02:11:17,481 --> 02:11:19,161
MARISHA: Thanks.

1591
02:11:19,161 --> 02:11:20,985
LAURA: How you doing, Percy?

1592
02:11:20,985 --> 02:11:25,132
TALIESIN: Grog, could you help with this?

1593
02:11:25,132 --> 02:11:28,456
TRAVIS: Do I get to chop down a tree, finally?

1594
02:11:28,456 --> 02:11:35,484
(laughter)

1595
02:11:35,484 --> 02:11:40,663
TALIESIN: I really wanted alligator boots, 
but I suppose that will do. Please help.

1596
02:11:40,663 --> 02:11:45,518
TRAVIS: Do I get to chop him? I start chopping
down the petrified alligator tree!

1597
02:11:45,518 --> 02:11:47,285
LAURA: Trinket, catch him when he falls.

1598
02:11:47,285 --> 02:11:49,072
TALIESIN: What?

1599
02:11:49,072 --> 02:11:55,093
MATT: Trinket rushes up and looks up at you
underneath with open jaws.

1600
02:11:55,093 --> 02:11:57,211
TALIESIN: No!

1601
02:11:57,211 --> 02:12:08,346
MATT: As Grog, large Grog, comes lumbering up.
(heavy footsteps, whack) With one clean hit, the

1602
02:12:08,346 --> 02:12:14,076
bloodaxe carves straight through its body,
causing the upper part of the torso to slam into

1603
02:12:14,076 --> 02:12:20,383
the ground with a big speed. Upon the impact, it
rolls a few feet, taking Percy in its jaws.

1604
02:12:20,383 --> 02:12:22,178
TALIESIN: Oh, ow!

1605
02:12:22,178 --> 02:12:32,807
MATT: You do suffer two points of damage from it,
but eventually you hit a point in the bank where

1606
02:12:32,807 --> 02:12:37,843
the jaw cracks into a hundred pieces, and you
tumble onto the ground and catch your breath,

1607
02:12:37,843 --> 02:12:40,071
after being restrained for so long.

1608
02:12:40,071 --> 02:12:41,950
TALIESIN: I stand up and kick one of them.

1609
02:12:41,950 --> 02:12:51,735
MARISHA: Keyleth wants to get down on the grass
that she hurt, and I want to cast Druidcraft and

1610
02:12:51,735 --> 02:12:59,733
heal it, and talk to the grass, and be like: It
wasn't personal. I hope you know you were not the

1611
02:12:59,733 --> 02:13:03,949
intended target, you just happened to be caught in
the fray. It's okay. Don't be mad.

1612
02:13:03,949 --> 02:13:10,587
MATT: As you extend your fingers about you, you
see small strands of green go (popping) and you

1613
02:13:10,587 --> 02:13:15,381
hear a hundred soft voices go, "Eh."

1614
02:13:15,381 --> 02:13:23,984
MARISHA: I like your enthusiasm, grass.

1615
02:13:23,984 --> 02:13:27,974
LAURA: All right. How are you doing over there,
gnomesies?

1616
02:13:27,974 --> 02:13:33,589
ASHLEY: Come on, you should get over here! No
rush, but.

1617
02:13:33,589 --> 02:13:36,994
TALIESIN: All right, there's a river.

1618
02:13:36,994 --> 02:13:39,198
SAM: Don't forget to loot the body?

1619
02:13:39,198 --> 02:13:42,598
LAURA: There's nothing to loot on the petrified
alligator, is there?

1620
02:13:42,598 --> 02:13:46,685
TALIESIN: Actually, there's an empty stomach,
isn't there?

1621
02:13:46,685 --> 02:13:49,072
TRAVIS: It's made of petrified wood.

1622
02:13:49,072 --> 02:13:52,274
TALIESIN: I'm going to stick my head in and see if
there's anything in there.

1623
02:13:52,274 --> 02:14:01,198
MATT: Okay. The very tiny, pressed stomach
interior of this creature, petrified as it is,

1624
02:14:01,198 --> 02:14:09,223
it's like staring into one of those weird high
school science room half-man organ presentation

1625
02:14:09,223 --> 02:14:14,324
statues. You can see where the folds of the
stomach lining are. There appear to be some

1626
02:14:14,324 --> 02:14:20,281
remnants of bone, some entities that were
partially digested, but nothing that catches your

1627
02:14:20,281 --> 02:14:22,596
eye to be something worth pulling out of it.

1628
02:14:22,596 --> 02:14:24,739
TALIESIN: Just for fun, Grog, smash this.

1629
02:14:24,739 --> 02:14:27,338
TRAVIS: Okay! (whack)

1630
02:14:27,338 --> 02:14:33,094
MATT: And with that, (shatter) the pieces of it go
scattered all across the ground. Elements of it

1631
02:14:33,094 --> 02:14:36,344
tumble into the water and get washed away. 
It is no more.

1632
02:14:36,344 --> 02:14:38,203
TRAVIS: How was that?

1633
02:14:38,203 --> 02:14:39,963
TALIESIN: Anything exciting come out?

1634
02:14:39,963 --> 02:14:43,569
MATT: Many small, petrified crocodile pieces.

1635
02:14:43,569 --> 02:14:49,306
TALIESIN: I'm going to pick one up 
and bring it to Keyleth. For you. Well done.

1636
02:14:49,306 --> 02:14:58,612
(applause)

1637
02:14:58,612 --> 02:15:05,501
MARISHA: I get a souvenir from the Feywild! 
That's all I wanted.

1638
02:15:05,501 --> 02:15:07,461
TRAVIS: We've got two more rivers, right?

1639
02:15:07,461 --> 02:15:11,241
MATT: One more, technically. You guys have all
made your way across. There's one last one that

1640
02:15:11,241 --> 02:15:13,226
leads to the outskirts of the Shademirk.

1641
02:15:13,226 --> 02:15:16,582
LAURA: I want to keep perception check up 
to make sure we don't run into

1642
02:15:16,582 --> 02:15:18,337
another one of those fuckers.

1643
02:15:18,337 --> 02:15:20,117
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.

1644
02:15:20,117 --> 02:15:25,004
TRAVIS: Listen, hey, is anybody near death? I'm
super big right now. How about I just throw

1645
02:15:25,004 --> 02:15:26,806
everybody across the river?

1646
02:15:26,806 --> 02:15:34,093
ASHLEY: I'll go.

1647
02:15:34,093 --> 02:15:35,500
TRAVIS: You want to?

1648
02:15:35,500 --> 02:15:36,880
MARISHA: I'm in.

1649
02:15:36,880 --> 02:15:38,808
TRAVIS: Can I throw Pike across the river?

1650
02:15:38,808 --> 02:15:39,878
MATT: Make a strength check.

1651
02:15:39,878 --> 02:15:43,145
LAURA: Yeah, Pike's already across. 
22 for perception.

1652
02:15:43,145 --> 02:15:56,062
TRAVIS: Wait. I need you to smack me in the face
first. (impact) I would like to rage! Natural 20.

1653
02:15:56,062 --> 02:16:04,504
ASHLEY: I'm going to get in a ball.

1654
02:16:04,504 --> 02:16:11,534
MATT: Which you have disadvantage on. Hold on,
because you took a point of exhaustion from frenzied

1655
02:16:11,534 --> 02:16:17,063
raging during the battle. However, you do get
advantage on strength checks while raging, so it's

1656
02:16:17,063 --> 02:16:27,404
a singular roll, so the natural 20 stands. So as
you pick Pike up, she smacks you in the face. The

1657
02:16:27,404 --> 02:16:43,651
grin crawls across, and you (whoosh) lob her. She
lands in the top of a tree. You see (cracking) in

1658
02:16:43,651 --> 02:16:50,876
the bushes as a few leaves dangle down. You can
see some gloppy black stuff out of the side, and

1659
02:16:50,876 --> 02:16:54,492
you hear this muffled voice in the distance as
Pike landed okay.

1660
02:16:54,492 --> 02:17:00,001
ASHLEY: She's laughing. That was awesome!

1661
02:17:00,001 --> 02:17:04,521
TRAVIS: Should I try and skip Vax across the
river?

1662
02:17:04,521 --> 02:17:13,621
(laughter)

1663
02:17:13,621 --> 02:17:15,302
MARISHA: Yeah, do it.

1664
02:17:15,302 --> 02:17:22,635
MATT: Vax says, "I'd rather run." And he goes
running forward and attempts to make a leap across

1665
02:17:22,635 --> 02:17:30,706
the river. He leaps, makes it most of the way,
catches his ankle on the edge,

1666
02:17:30,706 --> 02:17:32,460
and begins to flutter backward.

1667
02:17:32,460 --> 02:17:35,025
TRAVIS: That's what you get, stupid!

1668
02:17:35,025 --> 02:17:38,814
LAURA: Can't you save him? 
Aren't you on the other side?

1669
02:17:38,814 --> 02:17:43,794
SAM: I'm looking at the trees. I'm hanging out.

1670
02:17:43,794 --> 02:17:48,591
MATT: Yeah. However, he does manage to right
himself. He only got partially into the river and

1671
02:17:48,591 --> 02:17:52,208
managed to pull his way out, so he's fine. Grog,
who are you throwing next?

1672
02:17:52,208 --> 02:17:53,512
TRAVIS: Who's next?

1673
02:17:53,512 --> 02:17:54,575
TALIESIN: I'll go.

1674
02:17:54,575 --> 02:17:58,908
TRAVIS: Yeah, Percy's next! 
Can I granny shot this one?

1675
02:17:58,908 --> 02:18:01,627
MATT: Go for it. Strength check.

1676
02:18:01,627 --> 02:18:06,871
TRAVIS: 19.

1677
02:18:06,871 --> 02:18:17,168
MATT: (grunts) You lob him. It's enough to get you
across, but the landing is not very graceful.

1678
02:18:17,168 --> 02:18:19,542
TALIESIN: Can I acrobatics check this to try 
and make the landing?

1679
02:18:19,542 --> 02:18:21,800
MARISHA: Three-point landing.

1680
02:18:21,800 --> 02:18:24,575
TALIESIN: That'll be a 21.

1681
02:18:24,575 --> 02:18:31,294
MATT: 21. You manage to use the actual momentum 
to go into a shoulder roll, stumble forward, and you

1682
02:18:31,294 --> 02:18:36,511
come to a standing point. However, when you do,
you realize you rolled through a bunch of slick,

1683
02:18:36,511 --> 02:18:40,565
tar-like muck, and the side of your jacket is now
seeping with it.

1684
02:18:40,565 --> 02:18:44,202
TALIESIN: I was already covered in crocodile
bile.

1685
02:18:44,202 --> 02:18:47,037
MATT: There you go. You feel balanced.

1686
02:18:47,037 --> 02:18:49,308
TALIESIN: This is another layer of sadness.

1687
02:18:49,308 --> 02:18:50,674
TRAVIS: Who's next?

1688
02:18:50,674 --> 02:18:54,796
LAURA: I'll go next. But I want to bring out my
broom and hold it in my hand.

1689
02:18:54,796 --> 02:18:57,948
TRAVIS: In the spirit of the Olympic games, 
can I shot put her?

1690
02:18:57,948 --> 02:19:05,722
MATT: Make a strength check. 
You see Trinket come up.

1691
02:19:05,722 --> 02:19:09,443
LAURA: Come on!

1692
02:19:09,443 --> 02:19:11,841
MATT: Trinket goes into your necklace.

1693
02:19:11,841 --> 02:19:22,520
TRAVIS: Oh shit. No, it's not. It's a 23. 
I'm strong as fuck.

1694
02:19:22,520 --> 02:19:31,318
MATT: I would say the lighter half of the twins,
but I think they're an equal weight class. You

1695
02:19:31,318 --> 02:19:38,748
grab her by the side and (whoosh, grunt) launch
her into the air. You catch your stomach contents.

1696
02:19:38,748 --> 02:19:40,818
Make an acrobatics check.

1697
02:19:40,818 --> 02:19:44,674
LAURA: That's okay. That's a 28, man.

1698
02:19:44,674 --> 02:19:50,960
MATT: You actually catch yourself on the side of
the tree, landing, and then leap off of it with

1699
02:19:50,960 --> 02:19:53,582
the last bit of momentum, stepping gingerly 
on the tips of your feet.

1700
02:19:53,582 --> 02:19:55,575
ASHLEY: I clap from however far away I am.

1701
02:19:55,575 --> 02:19:59,884
MATT: You hear muffled clapping in the tree boughs
ahead of you.

1702
02:19:59,884 --> 02:20:04,238
LAURA: I fly up and I grab Pike down from the
tree. Can I do that?

1703
02:20:04,238 --> 02:20:05,591
MATT: She's about 15 feet up.

1704
02:20:05,591 --> 02:20:09,141
LAURA: Oh. I fly 15 feet up and grab Pike.

1705
02:20:09,141 --> 02:20:14,609
ASHLEY: Thanks! I didn't know 
how I was going to get down.

1706
02:20:14,609 --> 02:20:19,207
TRAVIS: Are you left?

1707
02:20:19,207 --> 02:20:20,431
MARISHA: I'm left.

1708
02:20:20,431 --> 02:20:23,506
TRAVIS: Do you want to go with me 
as I jump across, or should I throw you?

1709
02:20:23,506 --> 02:20:29,224
LAURA: Piggy-back that shit, Keyleth!

1710
02:20:29,224 --> 02:20:32,879
SAM: I wave my hands and say: 
I'll catch you, Kiki!

1711
02:20:32,879 --> 02:20:39,185
MARISHA: Okay. You want to shot put this one?

1712
02:20:39,185 --> 02:20:42,684
TRAVIS: No, it's going to be fast-pitch softball.

1713
02:20:42,684 --> 02:20:47,108
MARISHA: Okay.

1714
02:20:47,108 --> 02:20:52,402
TRAVIS: No, wait. I'm going to be a long snapper
in football and turn around.

1715
02:20:52,402 --> 02:21:02,051
(laughter)

1716
02:21:02,051 --> 02:21:08,238
SAM: I will receive that. Set!

1717
02:21:08,238 --> 02:21:09,516
TRAVIS: 19!

1718
02:21:09,516 --> 02:21:10,928
MARISHA: Hut!

1719
02:21:10,928 --> 02:21:18,564
MATT: (grunts) With a big long toss, you make it
most of the way over the water and begin to

1720
02:21:18,564 --> 02:21:22,604
descend very close on the opposite side of the
bank. Make an acrobatics check.

1721
02:21:22,604 --> 02:21:25,601
SAM: Use your new dice!

1722
02:21:25,601 --> 02:21:31,166
MARISHA: No, fuck that new dice. Nine. Not great.

1723
02:21:31,166 --> 02:21:37,251
MATT: The good news is, you miss the river. The
bad news is, you Warner Brothers cartoon faceplant

1724
02:21:37,251 --> 02:21:40,246
into the actual ground on the opposite side.

1725
02:21:40,246 --> 02:21:48,475
(laughter)

1726
02:21:48,475 --> 02:21:56,524
MATT: Suffering 11 points of damage, and as Percy
pulls you up, your entire front of your face and

1727
02:21:56,524 --> 02:22:03,642
the little bit of hair in the crown is caked with
this tar-like substance. Your nostrils are filled

1728
02:22:03,642 --> 02:22:09,128
with it. You can't open your eyes. It tastes like
IHOP. It's terrible.

1729
02:22:09,128 --> 02:22:14,510
ASHLEY: Hey!

1730
02:22:14,510 --> 02:22:19,216
MATT: Tonight's episode of Critical Role, not
brought to you by IHOP.

1731
02:22:19,216 --> 02:22:22,371
And probably never will be.

1732
02:22:22,371 --> 02:22:25,131
ASHLEY: There goes our IHOP sponsorship.

1733
02:22:25,131 --> 02:22:31,970
MARISHA: I gag a little, try to keep it down. Try
to wash my face if I can.

1734
02:22:31,970 --> 02:22:33,603
SAM: Who's left? Garmelie?

1735
02:22:33,603 --> 02:22:34,980
LAURA: Oh, Garmelie!

1736
02:22:34,980 --> 02:22:38,793
MATT: Garmelie's on the side. He goes, 
"Don't worry. You first."

1737
02:22:38,793 --> 02:22:44,344
LAURA: No, he's going to leave. I mean, he can. 
I guess you got us all the way here, didn't you?

1738
02:22:44,344 --> 02:22:47,183
MATT: "Once he's across, our accord is complete."

1739
02:22:47,183 --> 02:22:49,366
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. No, totally. Come here, bitch.

1740
02:22:49,366 --> 02:23:02,122
MATT: "No!" Roll an attack. Well, technically,
this is a grapple, so it's an athletics check.

1741
02:23:02,122 --> 02:23:06,557
TRAVIS: A 20. Total.

1742
02:23:06,557 --> 02:23:15,498
MATT: You reach out and his eyes go wide and he
darts around, and your fingers barely catch the edge

1743
02:23:15,498 --> 02:23:21,702
of his fur, and you get enough of a hold to lift
him off the ground. He's now dangling from your

1744
02:23:21,702 --> 02:23:26,706
giant half-giant ass hand. 
"No! I don't have to go there!

1745
02:23:26,706 --> 02:23:28,510
"I'm just going back the other way 
when we're done!"

1746
02:23:28,510 --> 02:23:30,480
TRAVIS: Oh, no, yeah, I totally hear what you're
saying. We're going for a ride, bitch.

1747
02:23:30,480 --> 02:23:31,819
And I back up.

1748
02:23:31,819 --> 02:23:43,480
MATT: Make an athletics check.

1749
02:23:43,480 --> 02:23:50,500
TRAVIS: 20 again. 12 plus eight.

1750
02:23:50,500 --> 02:23:58,376
MATT: Your large, bounding form 
(heavy footsteps, impact, scream).

1751
02:23:58,376 --> 02:24:03,013
As you make it across, you hit the other side. 
The actual bank shifts, and you guys feel

1752
02:24:03,013 --> 02:24:07,076
the impact on the other side beneath your feet, 
and there's a small crater in the ground

1753
02:24:07,076 --> 02:24:12,268
where you landed, and the river bank slowly fills
it in as it lowers it just below river water level.

1754
02:24:12,268 --> 02:24:18,630
Garmelie is now clutching your arm, 
his hands and legs wrapped around your forearm.

1755
02:24:18,630 --> 02:24:30,511
(laughter)

1756
02:24:30,511 --> 02:24:45,266
MATT: His head was on the other side. He
eventually loosens his grip, plops to the ground,

1757
02:24:45,266 --> 02:24:53,682
and dusts himself off a bit. "Very well. 
Welcome to the Shademirk. Good luck."

1758
02:24:53,682 --> 02:24:55,399
LAURA: We made it!

1759
02:24:55,399 --> 02:24:57,850
TRAVIS: You don't want to see 
what happens at the end of the journey?

1760
02:24:57,850 --> 02:24:59,634
You want to come with us, right?

1761
02:24:59,634 --> 02:25:07,037
MATT: He looks past you, and you all turn and look
into the Shademirk. At this point, you can see the

1762
02:25:07,037 --> 02:25:15,513
bog itself is an endless dumping form of sludge
into the Gilded Run. The water itself is barely

1763
02:25:15,513 --> 02:25:22,287
tearing it away, what you guys noticed before. The
black oily material is itself thick, ichor-like

1764
02:25:22,287 --> 02:25:29,446
tar. The smell that you're very familiar with,
that horrible, acrid, sulfurous scent is very

1765
02:25:29,446 --> 02:25:37,682
thick in the area, mixed with a terrible rotting
leaf and decay. You see bubbles going (bubbling)

1766
02:25:37,682 --> 02:25:41,319
and churning up in certain parts of it, and there
are elements where you see knotted and gnarled

1767
02:25:41,319 --> 02:25:47,515
roots that tangle up above the surface. It is the
most uninviting place in nature you've ever seen

1768
02:25:47,515 --> 02:25:52,380
and experienced, and you can see in the distance
the swamp trees with high root sections overhead

1769
02:25:52,380 --> 02:25:56,126
so you can walk underneath are scattered
throughout ahead of you.

1770
02:25:56,126 --> 02:26:03,897
Garmelie slowly turns his head back to you and
goes, "No, I'm all right. But I appreciate that.

1771
02:26:03,897 --> 02:26:14,948
"Be careful. Don't stay in one place too long. 
The longer you stand still, the harder it gets

1772
02:26:14,948 --> 02:26:20,586
"to escape the place you stood. And there's a lot 
of things that tend to live here, from what I've

1773
02:26:20,586 --> 02:26:26,543
"heard, that wait for stillness 
as a means of attack. So keep moving."

1774
02:26:26,543 --> 02:26:28,480
LAURA: Keep moving.

1775
02:26:28,480 --> 02:26:31,330
TRAVIS: What kinds of things?

1776
02:26:31,330 --> 02:26:35,683
MATT: "I don't know. It's time for me to go. 
Thank you guys so much. I appreciate this.

1777
02:26:35,683 --> 02:26:38,654
"It's been something."

1778
02:26:38,654 --> 02:26:43,671
LAURA: Wait, before he goes, 
I want to give him a kiss on his head.

1779
02:26:43,671 --> 02:26:49,605
MATT: A little kiss on the head, and he goes,
"Well, at least it's been a pleasure travelling

1780
02:26:49,605 --> 02:26:54,334
"with you, my lady." He takes your hand 
and does a little bow and (kiss) on the edge.

1781
02:26:54,334 --> 02:26:56,327
LAURA: As I was kissing him, 
can I give him a little pat down

1782
02:26:56,327 --> 02:26:58,271
to make sure he didn't steal anything?

1783
02:26:58,271 --> 02:27:08,383
(laughter and applause)

1784
02:27:08,383 --> 02:27:15,760
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1785
02:27:15,760 --> 02:27:18,634
LAURA: 23.

1786
02:27:18,634 --> 02:27:30,305
MATT: 23? As you feel down, you feel this slight
little bump inside of his fur, and you're afraid

1787
02:27:30,305 --> 02:27:38,067
to touch it for fear of it being-- on the outside
of his body! Not that you understand

1788
02:27:38,067 --> 02:28:00,485
the physicality of the satyr, but still. It's hard 
and smooth. And appears to wiggle loosely

1789
02:28:00,485 --> 02:28:07,284
when you touch it.

1790
02:28:07,284 --> 02:28:10,665
LAURA: Well, now I feel wrong saying I reach 
for it and try to see what it is.

1791
02:28:10,665 --> 02:28:12,214
MATT: Do you reach for it?

1792
02:28:12,214 --> 02:28:16,819
LAURA: Yeah!

1793
02:28:16,819 --> 02:28:18,688
MATT: All right.

1794
02:28:18,688 --> 02:28:20,354
MARISHA: You're committed now.

1795
02:28:20,354 --> 02:28:29,597
MATT: Grasping onto it, you tug, and pull forth
the small onyx mastiff that you had found earlier

1796
02:28:29,597 --> 02:28:30,915
in the campground.

1797
02:28:30,915 --> 02:28:33,465
LAURA: I take it back.

1798
02:28:33,465 --> 02:28:37,333
MATT: He goes, "Oh, that's right. I was holding
this for you."

1799
02:28:37,333 --> 02:28:39,550
LAURA: Thank you so much. You're so kind.

1800
02:28:39,550 --> 02:28:42,713
TRAVIS: The little black dog statue? 
Oh, I like that thing.

1801
02:28:42,713 --> 02:28:49,875
MATT: "Fantastic. Well, wish you all the best of
luck. Stay alive."

1802
02:28:49,875 --> 02:28:53,783
TRAVIS: Wait a minute. How do you plan on getting
back across the rivers?

1803
02:28:53,783 --> 02:29:11,713
MATT: "I have my ways." And he turns invisible.
You see little sludgy footprints go off down

1804
02:29:11,713 --> 02:29:15,086
the shore and around the bend.

1805
02:29:15,086 --> 02:29:17,121
MARISHA: Bye!

1806
02:29:17,121 --> 02:29:19,857
TALIESIN: Cast Hunter's Mark really quick.

1807
02:29:19,857 --> 02:29:22,673
LAURA: Oh, on him? Can I cast Hunter's Mark on him
really quick?

1808
02:29:22,673 --> 02:29:23,792
MATT: What do you want to do?

1809
02:29:23,792 --> 02:29:25,410
LAURA: Can I cast Hunter's Mark on him?

1810
02:29:25,410 --> 02:29:28,653
MATT: You cannot currently see him now. 
He's already vanished.

1811
02:29:28,653 --> 02:29:32,916
LAURA: Sorry. I should've done it when I was
kissing him, but I was distracted

1812
02:29:32,916 --> 02:29:34,918
by feeling him up.

1813
02:29:34,918 --> 02:29:40,792
MATT: It happens. All right, 
so what are you guys going to do?

1814
02:29:40,792 --> 02:29:44,463
TRAVIS: Awesome. So we're across the rivers.
Everything gets worse now,

1815
02:29:44,463 --> 02:29:46,225
and we can't stop moving.

1816
02:29:46,225 --> 02:29:48,525
TALIESIN: We should move until it's time to camp,
and when we camp,

1817
02:29:48,525 --> 02:29:51,098
we should camp in your palacious...

1818
02:29:51,098 --> 02:29:52,672
LAURA: Oh, in the mansion.

1819
02:29:52,672 --> 02:29:54,001
SAM: I've got the mansion.

1820
02:29:54,001 --> 02:29:55,051
LAURA: Thank god.

1821
02:29:55,051 --> 02:29:57,522
MARISHA: Are we in the bog now?

1822
02:29:57,522 --> 02:30:04,228
MATT: This would be the tangleward tip of it, the
southern tip of the bog, yes.

1823
02:30:04,228 --> 02:30:11,915
MARISHA: I want to test and see if we sink 
when we step on the bog.

1824
02:30:11,915 --> 02:30:15,517
MATT: Okay. You step onto it, and your foot
descends about three inches

1825
02:30:15,517 --> 02:30:18,056
before it comes to a stop. (squelch)

1826
02:30:18,056 --> 02:30:19,787
MARISHA: It comes to a stop.

1827
02:30:19,787 --> 02:30:27,862
MATT: But as you go to remove your foot, (sucking
sound). It's very sticky. Effectively, you guys

1828
02:30:27,862 --> 02:30:29,980
are at half movement moving through the bog.

1829
02:30:29,980 --> 02:30:37,286
LAURA: I cast Pass Without Trace on us so that we
can be stealthy. She doesn't have mist form,

1830
02:30:37,286 --> 02:30:38,858
not until we rest.

1831
02:30:38,858 --> 02:30:44,857
MARISHA: I could rest and learn mist, and we can
mist across. That was what I was going to say.

1832
02:30:44,857 --> 02:30:49,202
TRAVIS: Is it a treeline? Are we into trees?

1833
02:30:49,202 --> 02:30:55,502
MATT: Yeah, it is a very thickly wooded swamp now.
The ground floor and the base of most of the

1834
02:30:55,502 --> 02:31:01,224
trees, and occasionally dripping from the top of
the canopy itself is that black,

1835
02:31:01,224 --> 02:31:02,499
sludge-like material.

1836
02:31:02,499 --> 02:31:04,476
TRAVIS: It's dripping from the trees?

1837
02:31:04,476 --> 02:31:06,980
MATT: It's seemingly seeping from everything.

1838
02:31:06,980 --> 02:31:10,917
LAURA: I have Land's Stride. Does that mean that
this doesn't affect me?

1839
02:31:10,917 --> 02:31:12,792
Or am I still slowed down?

1840
02:31:12,792 --> 02:31:14,258
MATT: Read out Land's Stride to me.

1841
02:31:14,258 --> 02:31:24,634
LAURA: Land's Stride isn't on any of my pieces of
paper. Oh, wait. Here it is. Moving through

1842
02:31:24,634 --> 02:31:28,072
non-magical difficult terrain costs you 
no movement.

1843
02:31:28,072 --> 02:31:31,191
MATT: Technically, yes, you can move at your
normal pace. The rest of the party

1844
02:31:31,191 --> 02:31:33,145
still has to stay slowed.

1845
02:31:33,145 --> 02:31:37,897
LAURA: Then I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
I'm going to pull out my broom and I'm going to

1846
02:31:37,897 --> 02:31:43,509
let the gnomes ride on it, since you guys will
sink down a little bit more than the rest of us.

1847
02:31:43,509 --> 02:31:45,102
Do you want to ride on the broom?

1848
02:31:45,102 --> 02:31:46,546
SAM: How do we do that?

1849
02:31:46,546 --> 02:31:48,239
LAURA: You sit on it, and then you fly.

1850
02:31:48,239 --> 02:31:49,525
SAM: Do we have to say a magical word?

1851
02:31:49,525 --> 02:31:50,790
LAURA: I'll say it for you.

1852
02:31:50,790 --> 02:31:53,229
TALIESIN: I don't think it works that way. 
I think you have to tell them,

1853
02:31:53,229 --> 02:31:54,573
and then they have to say it.

1854
02:31:54,573 --> 02:31:55,662
LAURA: Oh, really?

1855
02:31:55,662 --> 02:31:56,931
MATT: You can try. It's up to you.

1856
02:31:56,931 --> 02:31:58,163
LAURA: Sit on it.

1857
02:31:58,163 --> 02:32:01,687
SAM: Okay. Whenever a woman tells me 
to sit on something, I do.

1858
02:32:01,687 --> 02:32:05,201
(laughter)

1859
02:32:05,201 --> 02:32:06,906
ASHLEY: Do you want front or back?

1860
02:32:06,906 --> 02:32:11,572
TRAVIS: Yeah, sit on it! Front or back?

1861
02:32:11,572 --> 02:32:14,417
SAM: I'll sit front, so you can have your arms
around me.

1862
02:32:14,417 --> 02:32:16,948
ASHLEY: Okay.

1863
02:32:16,948 --> 02:32:20,417
LAURA: That's sweet. (hacking spit)

1864
02:32:20,417 --> 02:32:27,423
MATT: Okay. As you guys get up onto the broom, you
release it from your grasp, and it goes (splat)

1865
02:32:27,423 --> 02:32:30,190
onto the ground. Both of you guys sink about three
or four inches into the ground.

1866
02:32:30,190 --> 02:32:31,724
LAURA: Say (hacking spit).

1867
02:32:31,724 --> 02:32:33,525
ASHLEY and SAM: (hacking spit).

1868
02:32:33,525 --> 02:32:39,602
MATT: It lifts up and pulls you guys slowly out of
the sludge, (squelch) finally freeing yourself,

1869
02:32:39,602 --> 02:32:42,292
and you're now hovering a very short distance
above the ground.

1870
02:32:42,292 --> 02:32:45,644
LAURA: So at least you guys and me aren't slowed
down, so that's good.

1871
02:32:45,644 --> 02:32:46,877
SAM: Bye, guys!

1872
02:32:46,877 --> 02:32:52,594
TRAVIS: By the way, now that we're out of all this
shit, can we look around and see if Ukurat

1873
02:32:52,594 --> 02:32:55,134
has been peeping us this entire time?

1874
02:32:55,134 --> 02:32:56,253
LAURA: Can we see him?

1875
02:32:56,253 --> 02:32:58,239
MATT: Make a perception check.

1876
02:32:58,239 --> 02:33:04,192
LAURA: We're not in the forest anymore? 
This is bog?

1877
02:33:04,192 --> 02:33:05,609
TRAVIS: 15.

1878
02:33:05,609 --> 02:33:10,055
MATT: Right now, technically it's swamp, yeah. 
Not considered forest.

1879
02:33:10,055 --> 02:33:11,908
TALIESIN: 16.

1880
02:33:11,908 --> 02:33:13,053
LAURA: 20.

1881
02:33:13,053 --> 02:33:14,187
SAM: 16 here.

1882
02:33:14,187 --> 02:33:22,545
MARISHA: Oh my god! It's a 31.

1883
02:33:22,545 --> 02:33:30,140
MATT: As you guys take a moment to look out in the
distance, you're unable to really make any idea of

1884
02:33:30,140 --> 02:33:35,903
a form or movement. Keyleth, you do see on the
tree on the other bank, it looks a little thicker

1885
02:33:35,903 --> 02:33:42,604
towards the top than you expect, and as you take a
moment to glance, you can see a rather large creature

1886
02:33:42,604 --> 02:33:47,896
drop down from the canopy onto the ground,
and then slink behind it.

1887
02:33:47,896 --> 02:33:50,244
LAURA: So he's checking us out.

1888
02:33:50,244 --> 02:33:51,682
MATT: He's following you.

1889
02:33:51,682 --> 02:33:53,846
LAURA: So he's going to be able to get across 
all these rivers?

1890
02:33:53,846 --> 02:33:55,819
TALIESIN: Apparently, he's fine.

1891
02:33:55,819 --> 02:33:58,671
LAURA: He's pretty cool. He can jump really far.

1892
02:33:58,671 --> 02:34:05,046
MARISHA: I give him a-- from a distance.

1893
02:34:05,046 --> 02:34:14,266
MATT: He shrinks sideways against the tree and is
now barely visible, other than his furry chest

1894
02:34:14,266 --> 02:34:16,888
that's now peeking out one side 
of the width of the tree.

1895
02:34:16,888 --> 02:34:19,072
MARISHA: I give him a--

1896
02:34:19,072 --> 02:34:27,337
MATT: No reaction. Vax at this point is like, 
"So are we going to move on, then?"

1897
02:34:27,337 --> 02:34:28,931
LAURA: Yes, but stealthily.

1898
02:34:28,931 --> 02:34:31,782
MATT: "Let's do it." Make a stealth check, guys.

1899
02:34:31,782 --> 02:34:34,368
LAURA: I cast Pass Without Trace on us, so we all
got plus ten.

1900
02:34:34,368 --> 02:34:35,910
ASHLEY: Oh!

1901
02:34:35,910 --> 02:34:43,193
LAURA: Did you get something good?

1902
02:34:43,193 --> 02:34:44,666
ASHLEY: I did.

1903
02:34:44,666 --> 02:34:46,494
TRAVIS: I fucked it all up.

1904
02:34:46,494 --> 02:34:50,615
(laughter)

1905
02:34:50,615 --> 02:34:55,699
SAM: 32.

1906
02:34:55,699 --> 02:34:56,906
MATT: 32?

1907
02:34:56,906 --> 02:34:58,387
SAM: I rolled a natural 20.

1908
02:34:58,387 --> 02:35:02,606
(cheering)

1909
02:35:02,606 --> 02:35:03,678
MATT: Percy.

1910
02:35:03,678 --> 02:35:05,161
TALIESIN: 33.

1911
02:35:05,161 --> 02:35:06,323
MATT: Keyleth.

1912
02:35:06,323 --> 02:35:07,718
MARISHA: 24.

1913
02:35:07,718 --> 02:35:09,585
MATT: All right, Vex.

1914
02:35:09,585 --> 02:35:10,558
LAURA: 32.

1915
02:35:10,558 --> 02:35:12,117
MATT: 32! Pike.

1916
02:35:12,117 --> 02:35:19,945
ASHLEY: I rolled a 30. I'm so quiet!

1917
02:35:19,945 --> 02:35:24,101
MATT: And over here we have 12-foot-tall Grog.
What did you roll?

1918
02:35:24,101 --> 02:35:27,597
TRAVIS: I rolled a 14.

1919
02:35:27,597 --> 02:35:33,969
MATT: You guys begin trudging forward into the
Shademirk. Everyone's being kind of...

1920
02:35:33,969 --> 02:35:36,970
and he's lumbering through it like a mammoth.

1921
02:35:36,970 --> 02:35:39,485
TRAVIS: We're being sneaky, guys!

1922
02:35:39,485 --> 02:35:52,936
MATT: You all shush him, and you find ways to
cushion his footfalls. As unstealthy as you may be

1923
02:35:52,936 --> 02:35:56,878
in the moment, the rest of the party helps try to
keep you going forward the best they can, being

1924
02:35:56,878 --> 02:36:01,583
unheard. You guys continue forward for about 30
minutes, not really understanding the direction.

1925
02:36:01,583 --> 02:36:06,717
You know that heavy mountain that you saw on the
way in is central and to the right of your

1926
02:36:06,717 --> 02:36:11,974
direction, and you're not entirely certain where
the tree is here in the Shademirk, but you're

1927
02:36:11,974 --> 02:36:16,736
keeping your eyes peeled, and you continue to move
forward further and further in. It is difficult.

1928
02:36:16,736 --> 02:36:23,043
It is hot. It is muggy. There are heavy insects,
large winged bugs (buzzing) through the air, and

1929
02:36:23,043 --> 02:36:28,587
you knock them away. The bubbling of the ground
itself is releasing sulfurous gas and various

1930
02:36:28,587 --> 02:36:32,336
other chemicals into the air that are probably not
healthy to breathe extensively. Many of you are

1931
02:36:32,336 --> 02:36:35,401
having to cover your mouth to keep from coughing
to break up your stealth capabilities.

1932
02:36:35,401 --> 02:36:37,257
TALIESIN: I'm going to mask it.

1933
02:36:37,257 --> 02:36:38,656
MATT: Put your mask on, okay.

1934
02:36:38,656 --> 02:36:41,566
LAURA: Can I keep an eye out for any movement
ahead of us or around us?

1935
02:36:41,566 --> 02:36:43,427
MATT: Make a perception check. Yes?

1936
02:36:43,427 --> 02:36:45,609
TRAVIS: I only stay enlarged for ten minutes.

1937
02:36:45,609 --> 02:36:50,859
MATT: At this point, it has now died down, and
your form has shifted to its normal form.

1938
02:36:50,859 --> 02:36:52,907
TRAVIS: Do I get to reroll my stealth check?

1939
02:36:52,907 --> 02:36:54,204
MATT: No.

1940
02:36:54,204 --> 02:36:55,979
LAURA: 29.

1941
02:36:55,979 --> 02:37:03,041
MATT: As you guys move forward and Vex is keeping
watch, Vex, you see ahead of you about 80 yards,

1942
02:37:03,041 --> 02:37:09,314
a large, stocky tree in the distance that has 
a gentle glow emanating from the trunk.

1943
02:37:09,314 --> 02:37:11,303
SAM: Burn it down.

1944
02:37:11,303 --> 02:37:14,623
TALIESIN: That simple.

1945
02:37:14,623 --> 02:37:17,522
LAURA: Does it look 
like the tree we're looking for?

1946
02:37:17,522 --> 02:37:20,305
MATT: It's hard to say at this distance. You would
have to get closer to get a better look.

1947
02:37:20,305 --> 02:37:21,643
TRAVIS: How far off is it?

1948
02:37:21,643 --> 02:37:22,961
MATT: About 80 yards.

1949
02:37:22,961 --> 02:37:26,729
LAURA: 80 yards. Fuck, I'm so scared 
of everything here.

1950
02:37:26,729 --> 02:37:28,642
TRAVIS: Well, what's between us and it?

1951
02:37:28,642 --> 02:37:32,370
MATT: A series of trees and a few low areas of
open sludge.

1952
02:37:32,370 --> 02:37:35,537
LAURA: And it's a tree with a glowing bottom?

1953
02:37:35,537 --> 02:37:38,773
MATT: It looks thicker than a lot of the other trees
that you've seen in the area,

1954
02:37:38,773 --> 02:37:41,439
and there's a dull glow at the base of it.

1955
02:37:41,439 --> 02:37:45,184
TRAVIS: I've got a great idea. Let's send Trinket
to go check out the tree.

1956
02:37:45,184 --> 02:37:47,436
LAURA: What the fuck? Why?

1957
02:37:47,436 --> 02:37:50,339
TRAVIS: He's a bear, and this is the woods.

1958
02:37:50,339 --> 02:37:52,657
TALIESIN: This is not the woods. This is a bog.

1959
02:37:52,657 --> 02:37:55,836
LAURA: If he goes unconscious, he does
automatically come back. But no, that's only

1960
02:37:55,836 --> 02:37:59,478
within 100 feet, that's not 80 yards. No.

1961
02:37:59,478 --> 02:38:11,645
TALIESIN: So take the broom back 
and fly 100 feet behind him. It's an idea.

1962
02:38:11,645 --> 02:38:15,727
MARISHA: But we're only 80 yards out. Feet? 80
feet?

1963
02:38:15,727 --> 02:38:20,487
LAURA: I'm not slowed down, so you know what, 
I'm going to sneak behind Trinket.

1964
02:38:20,487 --> 02:38:23,118
I'll send Trinket out, and I'll sneak 
100 feet behind him.

1965
02:38:23,118 --> 02:38:27,153
MATT: Trinket emerges (impact) in the sludge.
(moans)

1966
02:38:27,153 --> 02:38:33,291
LAURA: I'm sorry, buddy. Okay. Don't get too far
ahead of me. We're going to sneak ahead

1967
02:38:33,291 --> 02:38:35,124
and check out this glowy tree. See it?

1968
02:38:35,124 --> 02:38:36,695
MATT: (grunts)

1969
02:38:36,695 --> 02:38:40,478
LAURA: Yeah. All right. Sneaky-sneaky.

1970
02:38:40,478 --> 02:38:48,922
MATT: And Trinket manages to stalk forward. Make a
stealth check for Trinket, without the plus ten,

1971
02:38:48,922 --> 02:38:51,407
because Trinket was not around 
when you cast the spell.

1972
02:38:51,407 --> 02:38:56,061
LAURA: That's mean. What do I add?

1973
02:38:56,061 --> 02:38:58,113
MATT: His dexterity modifier.

1974
02:38:58,113 --> 02:38:59,665
LAURA: Yeah, okay. Six.

1975
02:38:59,665 --> 02:39:02,815
MARISHA: Total?

1976
02:39:02,815 --> 02:39:05,118
TALIESIN: Really?

1977
02:39:05,118 --> 02:39:06,869
TRAVIS: It was a six?

1978
02:39:06,869 --> 02:39:09,724
LAURA: He gets no pluses.

1979
02:39:09,724 --> 02:39:12,476
MATT: Nope. He's not very stealthy, that bear.

1980
02:39:12,476 --> 02:39:17,982
LAURA: No. He's a bear in armor. No. Six.

1981
02:39:17,982 --> 02:39:24,503
MATT: Oh, it was a six. I thought you were joking.
All right. Trinket (squishy footsteps). You can

1982
02:39:24,503 --> 02:39:28,939
hear the impact coming as each footfall hits the
sludge. As you get closer towards it, keeping at

1983
02:39:28,939 --> 02:39:33,926
bay, as best out of sight as possible. You see the
tree, while it is thicker, it is not as high as

1984
02:39:33,926 --> 02:39:38,846
the other trees. In fact, where there would be a
top of a tree, it looks to be instead a tangled

1985
02:39:38,846 --> 02:39:45,438
mass of branches that have been matted over and
tied down to the top of where this tree ends.

1986
02:39:45,438 --> 02:39:47,189
LAURA: I tell him to stop.

1987
02:39:47,189 --> 02:39:54,391
MATT: Trinket stops. You get a glance and the
small glow is apparently a porthole or a window

1988
02:39:54,391 --> 02:39:59,478
that is carved circular out from one side of the
trunk of this tree. The glow is a dull

1989
02:39:59,478 --> 02:40:02,099
reddish-orange, and it's flickering 
like firelight.

1990
02:40:02,099 --> 02:40:04,817
TRAVIS: It's the Keebler elves. Kill them all!

1991
02:40:04,817 --> 02:40:12,395
LAURA: I call him back. I feel like that's
animals. That's not the tree we're looking for.

1992
02:40:12,395 --> 02:40:15,367
MARISHA: This is not the tree we're looking for.

1993
02:40:15,367 --> 02:40:18,455
MATT: Trinket backs up towards you.

1994
02:40:18,455 --> 02:40:21,070
LAURA: Come back in.

1995
02:40:21,070 --> 02:40:26,412
MATT: (squish, grunts) Dives into the necklace.

1996
02:40:26,412 --> 02:40:38,883
MARISHA: The whole time, us who were waiting have
been do-si-do-ing around each other. We don't stop

1997
02:40:38,883 --> 02:40:42,494
moving, so we're dancing in circles.

1998
02:40:42,494 --> 02:40:50,652
MATT: It's like you're lagging. 
All right, what are you doing, Vex?

1999
02:40:50,652 --> 02:40:55,752
LAURA: So it's a tree that looks like there's
people living in it? It's a window looking out?

2000
02:40:55,752 --> 02:41:00,436
MATT: It seems to have an interior and some sort
of warm firelight from the inside.

2001
02:41:00,436 --> 02:41:04,461
LAURA: That's definitely a fairy tree. I'm going
to stay clear. I'm going to go back. I'm going to

2002
02:41:04,461 --> 02:41:06,641
go back to the party and tell them what I see.

2003
02:41:06,641 --> 02:41:10,443
MATT: All right. Vex returns from out of 
the shadows of the forest, no Trinket in tow.

2004
02:41:10,443 --> 02:41:12,978
LAURA: Trinket died.

2005
02:41:12,978 --> 02:41:21,105
SAM: Oh my god!

2006
02:41:21,105 --> 02:41:28,872
LAURA: You're a dick. I'm joking. I think it's
fairies. I think we should probably stay clear. It

2007
02:41:28,872 --> 02:41:31,846
looked like there were things living in the tree.
It doesn't look like the cancerous tree.

2008
02:41:31,846 --> 02:41:33,894
TALIESIN: They may know 
where we want to go, though.

2009
02:41:33,894 --> 02:41:37,266
MARISHA: The pixies and fairies 
haven't been that nice.

2010
02:41:37,266 --> 02:41:44,517
TALIESIN: I'm not saying they're nice. I'm saying
that maybe we need some new guidance.

2011
02:41:44,517 --> 02:41:47,124
TRAVIS: Yeah. Look, maybe 
if you let me talk to them--

2012
02:41:47,124 --> 02:41:51,509
LAURA: How about no diplomacy from you. 
Maybe Scanlan should go talk to them.

2013
02:41:51,509 --> 02:41:56,242
SAM: I could talk to them, but I want to know what
they are first. We should do some recon and at

2014
02:41:56,242 --> 02:42:01,250
least see what kind of creature they are. I can't
just knock on a door. What if it's a crazy monster

2015
02:42:01,250 --> 02:42:02,668
that pops its head out?

2016
02:42:02,668 --> 02:42:04,408
TRAVIS: Then it eats you.

2017
02:42:04,408 --> 02:42:06,413
TALIESIN: We'll shoot you first. 
You won't feel anything.

2018
02:42:06,413 --> 02:42:10,611
SAM: I'll go up and talk, but aren't you curious?

2019
02:42:10,611 --> 02:42:12,077
TALIESIN: No, not really.

2020
02:42:12,077 --> 02:42:15,279
TRAVIS: I've got your back. I'll go with you.

2021
02:42:15,279 --> 02:42:16,606
LAURA: No.

2022
02:42:16,606 --> 02:42:17,742
TRAVIS: Why?!

2023
02:42:17,742 --> 02:42:20,968
TALIESIN: We'll send Trinket, too, so either way,
you feel like you've accomplished something.

2024
02:42:20,968 --> 02:42:26,367
You'll both die, and then you'll know 
that the bear goes with you.

2025
02:42:26,367 --> 02:42:27,811
MARISHA: It's a bonding trip.

2026
02:42:27,811 --> 02:42:29,958
ASHLEY: Do you want me 
to stay with you on the broom?

2027
02:42:29,958 --> 02:42:30,915
SAM: Yes!

2028
02:42:30,915 --> 02:42:32,957
LAURA: Oh, wait, you're taking the broom?

2029
02:42:32,957 --> 02:42:36,629
(laughter)

2030
02:42:36,629 --> 02:42:40,834
SAM: Do you care more about the broom than me?

2031
02:42:40,834 --> 02:42:42,511
TALIESIN: Don't answer that.

2032
02:42:42,511 --> 02:42:46,339
SAM: You've known me for years! 
You just met the broom!

2033
02:42:46,339 --> 02:42:52,444
ASHLEY: Maybe we can land there, 
and then we can send the broom back to you.

2034
02:42:52,444 --> 02:42:54,384
SAM: No, I need the broom to get away!

2035
02:42:54,384 --> 02:42:56,963
TALIESIN: That's a fair point.

2036
02:42:56,963 --> 02:42:59,351
TRAVIS: In order to stay alive, 
you need to be near the broom.

2037
02:42:59,351 --> 02:43:03,502
TALIESIN: We'll keep an eye out, Vex. It'll be
fine.

2038
02:43:03,502 --> 02:43:05,781
TRAVIS: Yeah, the two gnomes go. 
They're not very intimidating.

2039
02:43:05,781 --> 02:43:07,677
LAURA: I do not like this plan at all.

2040
02:43:07,677 --> 02:43:11,843
TALIESIN: You are charming. You're both very
charming, so be charming.

2041
02:43:11,843 --> 02:43:13,285
ASHLEY: I'm not that charming.

2042
02:43:13,285 --> 02:43:14,741
TALIESIN: You're extremely charming.

2043
02:43:14,741 --> 02:43:16,186
MARISHA: I think <i>you</i> find her charming.

2044
02:43:16,186 --> 02:43:17,439
TALIESIN: She is charming.

2045
02:43:17,439 --> 02:43:20,256
MARISHA: I find her charming, too, but it doesn't
mean that other people might.

2046
02:43:20,256 --> 02:43:23,820
SAM: What could possibly go wrong?

2047
02:43:23,820 --> 02:43:25,517
LAURA: Can I go on the broom with you, Scanlan?

2048
02:43:25,517 --> 02:43:27,238
TRAVIS: No! Let the little bits go.

2049
02:43:27,238 --> 02:43:31,458
MARISHA: We're still doing a do-si-do, by the way,
while we're having this conversation.

2050
02:43:31,458 --> 02:43:33,327
TRAVIS: Little bits go.

2051
02:43:33,327 --> 02:43:37,698
SAM: All right, Pikey. Let's go knock on the door
and get killed.

2052
02:43:37,698 --> 02:43:41,801
LAURA: If you fucking get my broom lost because
you told me not to go, I'm going to murder you.

2053
02:43:41,801 --> 02:43:49,712
And this is not in character. 
This is me telling you that.

2054
02:43:49,712 --> 02:43:52,596
TRAVIS: I just want to say, that was a death
threat in front of a thousand people.

2055
02:43:52,596 --> 02:43:59,037
(laughter)

2056
02:43:59,037 --> 02:44:01,635
TALIESIN: I think with this many witnesses, 
it's not a threat. It's a promise.

2057
02:44:01,635 --> 02:44:09,156
MARISHA: Is there a nearby tree 
that I can climb into?

2058
02:44:09,156 --> 02:44:13,959
MATT: There are a number of trees in the vicinity,
yes. Where this thing is, though, there is about a

2059
02:44:13,959 --> 02:44:18,122
30-foot distance between it and any other trees.
It's in the center of a small clearing.

2060
02:44:18,122 --> 02:44:19,605
TALIESIN: I want a good vantage.

2061
02:44:19,605 --> 02:44:24,604
MARISHA: Yeah. I get into a vantage point. I get
up into a tree, and while they go do their recon,

2062
02:44:24,604 --> 02:44:28,160
I want to cast Commune With Nature.

2063
02:44:28,160 --> 02:44:34,395
MATT: All right. So as you ascend the side of the
nearest tree, and it resembles Atreyu climbing up

2064
02:44:34,395 --> 02:44:40,520
the tree in the Swamp of Sadness, as it's these
large gnarled branches and bits of muck and dust

2065
02:44:40,520 --> 02:44:45,609
falling off the sides, and the oil slick that is
surrounding the base makes it difficult to find

2066
02:44:45,609 --> 02:44:49,825
your handholds, but you do eventually get your way
up into the tree over the next five to ten

2067
02:44:49,825 --> 02:44:54,043
minutes. You were going to cast Commune with
Nature, you said?

2068
02:44:54,043 --> 02:44:56,640
MARISHA: Yes.

2069
02:44:56,640 --> 02:44:59,910
MATT: All right. What do you want to ask?

2070
02:44:59,910 --> 02:45:08,195
MARISHA: Do I sense a cancerous tree 
in the area?

2071
02:45:08,195 --> 02:45:14,729
MATT: You're asking this of the tree? 
Or is this the land around you, right?

2072
02:45:14,729 --> 02:45:16,267
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm not asking the tree.

2073
02:45:16,267 --> 02:45:19,781
MATT: You concentrate for a second. You feel
yourself link with the land, and it's a very

2074
02:45:19,781 --> 02:45:24,427
jarring sensation. You're used to connecting with
nature being this serene, wonderful experience.

2075
02:45:24,427 --> 02:45:30,811
This is like plugging into a nightmare. Suddenly,
your thought process is filled with this

2076
02:45:30,811 --> 02:45:38,366
ever-drawn sense of dread. You feel this cold
sensation fill your form, and you manage to get

2077
02:45:38,366 --> 02:45:43,216
this information across, but it leaves this very
hollow feeling in the center of your being.

2078
02:45:43,216 --> 02:45:51,194
Feeling out, you do not sense a cancerous tree,
but you do sense the strengthening presence

2079
02:45:51,194 --> 02:45:57,781
of the source of this entire swamp's perpetual
destitution and slow decay,

2080
02:45:57,781 --> 02:46:00,459
further to the northwest of this.

2081
02:46:00,459 --> 02:46:09,240
MARISHA: Northwest. Okay. So I can safely assume
that the tree that they're heading towards

2082
02:46:09,240 --> 02:46:10,474
is not cancerous.

2083
02:46:10,474 --> 02:46:11,527
MATT: Correct.

2084
02:46:11,527 --> 02:46:13,417
LAURA: So we should call them back.

2085
02:46:13,417 --> 02:46:26,976
MARISHA: I'm meditating. Then can I get a general
lay of the land and sense running water

2086
02:46:26,976 --> 02:46:29,368
and rivers, so we can avoid those?

2087
02:46:29,368 --> 02:46:36,116
MATT: Okay. In feeling any source of bodies of
water, you're too far from the Gilded Run to sense

2088
02:46:36,116 --> 02:46:42,949
any of that, and there is no running water within
the actual Shademirk. Everything is a very

2089
02:46:42,949 --> 02:46:49,823
slow-rolling sludge from the direction that you
initially sensed. It's this perpetual billowing of

2090
02:46:49,823 --> 02:46:56,079
slow, crawling death. What little bit of running
water you would sense is deep underground,

2091
02:46:56,079 --> 02:47:00,251
and probably still in danger, over the next 
50 years or so, of being corrupted itself.

2092
02:47:00,251 --> 02:47:10,977
MARISHA: Oh. Okay. For my last question, 
can I get a sense on any big evil things

2093
02:47:10,977 --> 02:47:12,654
that might want to kill us?

2094
02:47:12,654 --> 02:47:15,093
MATT: You need to be a little more specific 
than that.

2095
02:47:15,093 --> 02:47:18,034
(laughter)

2096
02:47:18,034 --> 02:47:32,203
MARISHA: Everything. More specific that I won't
screw it up. Are there Twinkies? Are there any

2097
02:47:32,203 --> 02:47:44,248
more large crocodile dudes living under the-- I
don't know. Any more large things

2098
02:47:44,248 --> 02:47:46,199
living under the swamp?

2099
02:47:46,199 --> 02:47:50,979
MATT: So you do a sense for large, dangerous plant
life entities like that crocodile.

2100
02:47:50,979 --> 02:47:55,882
MARISHA: Yes, under the swamp. Well, wherever.
Just blanket it.

2101
02:47:55,882 --> 02:48:03,889
MATT: As you extend your presence, you get no
images or any sense of creatures like that

2102
02:48:03,889 --> 02:48:10,963
crocodile. However, you do sense a rather intense
presence throughout this bog at certain places

2103
02:48:10,963 --> 02:48:15,366
of other corrupted plant life entities.

2104
02:48:15,366 --> 02:48:24,099
MARISHA: Does the tree in front of us count as a
corrupted plant life entity? And none of the

2105
02:48:24,099 --> 02:48:30,130
pixies that live in there are showing up on my
radar as bad?

2106
02:48:30,130 --> 02:48:35,184
MATT: No. That's your final question. The spell
fades. You climb your way back down

2107
02:48:35,184 --> 02:48:37,083
out of the branches of the tree.

2108
02:48:37,083 --> 02:48:38,965
MARISHA: This place sucks.

2109
02:48:38,965 --> 02:48:40,569
LAURA: What did you see?

2110
02:48:40,569 --> 02:48:47,360
MARISHA: It's so sad. The trees are so sad.

2111
02:48:47,360 --> 02:48:49,518
LAURA: Anything useful?

2112
02:48:49,518 --> 02:48:52,246
TRAVIS: They're sad, or they're angry also?

2113
02:48:52,246 --> 02:48:54,146
MARISHA: A little bit of both.

2114
02:48:54,146 --> 02:48:56,401
LAURA: Should we call the gnomes back?

2115
02:48:56,401 --> 02:48:58,381
MARISHA: They're fine.

2116
02:48:58,381 --> 02:49:02,288
(laughter)

2117
02:49:02,288 --> 02:49:09,433
MARISHA: The presence of the distortion and the
corruption is getting stronger northeast.

2118
02:49:09,433 --> 02:49:13,282
TRAVIS: Then we should all go. We shouldn't just
send the little bits in there, we should all go.

2119
02:49:13,282 --> 02:49:20,069
LAURA: I don't want to fight anymore before we get
to whatever it is that we're getting to.

2120
02:49:20,069 --> 02:49:22,233
TRAVIS: All right.

2121
02:49:22,233 --> 02:49:24,334
MATT: Have the gnomes already been set on their
path at this time?

2122
02:49:24,334 --> 02:49:25,787
SAM: We're already cruising.

2123
02:49:25,787 --> 02:49:28,801
MATT: Yep. So as you guys are having this
discussion, the broom slowly glides up to the

2124
02:49:28,801 --> 02:49:32,412
outside of this tree. As you get close to it, you
notice, too, from your immediate position, that

2125
02:49:32,412 --> 02:49:38,724
mass of dried roots and branches that are up top
are threaded together with rope. There is

2126
02:49:38,724 --> 02:49:44,152
definitely construction to this, almost like a
wooden thatched roof. The side porthole you see

2127
02:49:44,152 --> 02:49:50,179
does have a wooden crossbeam in the center. It is
definitely a functional and pretty well-crafted

2128
02:49:50,179 --> 02:49:55,843
window for this rather rough exterior. The roots
of the tree, though it is not very tall, it is

2129
02:49:55,843 --> 02:50:02,460
thick. It is round. It's probably a good 25, 30
feet wide, this tree's trunk, and the roots are

2130
02:50:02,460 --> 02:50:07,937
large and sink deep into the ground in the
vicinity. You see the glow from the window.

2131
02:50:07,937 --> 02:50:09,148
What do you want to do?

2132
02:50:09,148 --> 02:50:10,574
LAURA: Don't do it.

2133
02:50:10,574 --> 02:50:13,042
SAM: What? Who said that? What?

2134
02:50:13,042 --> 02:50:14,489
TRAVIS: Attack the tree.

2135
02:50:14,489 --> 02:50:17,763
SAM: I'm getting mixed messages.

2136
02:50:17,763 --> 02:50:21,766
ASHLEY: Scanlan, I'm a little nervous about 
these ropes. What if they're trying

2137
02:50:21,766 --> 02:50:23,401
to catch us or something?

2138
02:50:23,401 --> 02:50:24,853
TALIESIN: How many windows are there?

2139
02:50:24,853 --> 02:50:25,979
MATT: One from what you can see.

2140
02:50:25,979 --> 02:50:27,010
TALIESIN: Just one window?

2141
02:50:27,010 --> 02:50:28,224
LAURA: Don't do it.

2142
02:50:28,224 --> 02:50:29,474
SAM: You're not there.

2143
02:50:29,474 --> 02:50:31,843
MARISHA: I think Vex might be right.

2144
02:50:31,843 --> 02:50:32,893
LAURA: Come back.

2145
02:50:32,893 --> 02:50:35,929
SAM: Come back? Should we do a fly by the window
to see what's inside?

2146
02:50:35,929 --> 02:50:39,190
LAURA: Don't even fly close to the tree. I have
really bad feelings about this.

2147
02:50:39,190 --> 02:50:40,783
SAM: Fly by the window and peek in.

2148
02:50:40,783 --> 02:50:42,522
LAURA: Fucking shit mother bitch!

2149
02:50:42,522 --> 02:50:45,314
MATT: What do you do?

2150
02:50:45,314 --> 02:50:51,960
SAM: Using our expert flying skills, we're going
to fly by the window and do one of these, and

2151
02:50:51,960 --> 02:50:55,930
check out the Berenstain Bears and then run.

2152
02:50:55,930 --> 02:50:58,717
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check.

2153
02:50:58,717 --> 02:51:01,484
SAM: Not good. Eight.

2154
02:51:01,484 --> 02:51:10,975
ASHLEY: Wait. Okay. I think I just have so much mud in
my eye I don't see anything.

2155
02:51:10,975 --> 02:51:18,957
MATT: Okay. You don't pick up a lot of detail, but
as you come up over the top, looking on the

2156
02:51:18,957 --> 02:51:24,228
inside, it looks to be rather comfortable,
surprisingly. It's a small home. There's a table,

2157
02:51:24,228 --> 02:51:30,008
and there's a small hearth. There appears to be
what looks to be a shelf of some kind, ramshackle,

2158
02:51:30,008 --> 02:51:36,085
maybe, but still functional, with books pressed
into it. You can see a number of small baskets

2159
02:51:36,085 --> 02:51:41,580
hanging from the ceiling, containing various roots
and other pieces of plant matter that are gathered

2160
02:51:41,580 --> 02:51:47,691
and bundled together. You can see there is a
fireplace by the hearth. There is also a series of

2161
02:51:47,691 --> 02:51:55,346
drying animal carcasses hung in the corner that
are all stripped, and they're being aired out in

2162
02:51:55,346 --> 02:52:02,042
that space. You also see what looks to be a large
chair that is facing the hearth, slightly away

2163
02:52:02,042 --> 02:52:08,606
from you, and a small end table next to it that
contains a little teacup and a little tea set.

2164
02:52:08,606 --> 02:52:10,806
SAM: They look nice.

2165
02:52:10,806 --> 02:52:15,344
TALIESIN: What size person is the chair for?

2166
02:52:15,344 --> 02:52:17,691
SAM: Small?

2167
02:52:17,691 --> 02:52:22,289
MATT: Actually, the chair is pretty large. It's
tall. The tea set is small. And as you're making a

2168
02:52:22,289 --> 02:52:29,133
look, you see one large crooked hand reach out
from behind the chair with impossibly long fingers

2169
02:52:29,133 --> 02:52:36,968
with hooked nails reach over. You can see what
looks like dried wrappings hanging from parts of

2170
02:52:36,968 --> 02:52:42,782
its wrist and elbow as it reaches over and wraps
its gnarled fingers around this tiny teacup and

2171
02:52:42,782 --> 02:52:45,457
pull it back behind the chair.

2172
02:52:45,457 --> 02:52:47,507
TALIESIN: Do you describe this?

2173
02:52:47,507 --> 02:52:52,745
SAM: I don't. I see it and I turn around 
and I say: Pike, let's get out of here.

2174
02:52:52,745 --> 02:53:02,132
MATT: At this point, you hear a snap sound, and
next to you, you hear this (creak) as a little bit

2175
02:53:02,132 --> 02:53:06,912
of light peeks out to your left. A door has slowly
opened on the side of the tree trunk.

2176
02:53:06,912 --> 02:53:12,212
ASHLEY: Guys? Guys!

2177
02:53:12,212 --> 02:53:17,697
LAURA: Please fly fucking back right now! Please!

2178
02:53:17,697 --> 02:53:19,840
ASHLEY: What do you want to do, Scanlan?

2179
02:53:19,840 --> 02:53:24,205
SAM: We bolt. We bolt for it.

2180
02:53:24,205 --> 02:53:25,456
ASHLEY: (hacking spit)

2181
02:53:25,456 --> 02:53:27,233
SAM: (hacking spit) And start flying.

2182
02:53:27,233 --> 02:53:28,373
MATT: Flying where?

2183
02:53:28,373 --> 02:53:29,597
SAM: Back to our friends.

2184
02:53:29,597 --> 02:53:36,916
MATT: Okay. You guys turn and begin making your
way back towards the party, and the broom slows.

2185
02:53:36,916 --> 02:53:41,067
ASHLEY: Oh no.

2186
02:53:41,067 --> 02:53:53,414
(laughter)

2187
02:53:53,414 --> 02:53:55,345
LAURA: How far away is it?

2188
02:53:55,345 --> 02:53:59,233
MATT: It comes to a stop and then drops out from
under you both (squish) into the sludge.

2189
02:53:59,233 --> 02:54:01,519
ASHLEY: Okay. That's okay.

2190
02:54:01,519 --> 02:54:07,294
SAM: I grab Pike, and we both go invisible.

2191
02:54:07,294 --> 02:54:10,814
ASHLEY: I pick up the broom before we go
invisible.

2192
02:54:10,814 --> 02:54:14,312
MATT: All right, and you're casting Invisibility?

2193
02:54:14,312 --> 02:54:17,068
SAM: Invisibility. I guess at one level higher,
right? Is that what I do?

2194
02:54:17,068 --> 02:54:22,754
MATT: I believe that's what you do to get more of
that. Making sure real fast,

2195
02:54:22,754 --> 02:54:23,940
so we don't mess this up.

2196
02:54:23,940 --> 02:54:28,334
SAM: Level three Invisibility.

2197
02:54:28,334 --> 02:54:30,583
TALIESIN: Her house is going to have 
chicken feet.

2198
02:54:30,583 --> 02:54:41,606
(laughter)

2199
02:54:41,606 --> 02:54:43,904
MATT: You both turn invisible, her clutching the
broom.

2200
02:54:43,904 --> 02:54:45,888
ASHLEY: What?

2201
02:54:45,888 --> 02:54:48,377
MATT: You're both invisible now. You're clutching
the broom.

2202
02:54:48,377 --> 02:54:50,066
ASHLEY: We're invisible and the broom is
invisible?

2203
02:54:50,066 --> 02:54:52,529
MATT: Yeah.

2204
02:54:52,529 --> 02:54:56,115
LAURA: I go (surprised shriek).

2205
02:54:56,115 --> 02:55:00,654
SAM: We start tip-toeing out, I suppose.

2206
02:55:00,654 --> 02:55:07,158
MATT: You watch them vanish ahead of you. A few
moments pass, and you guys end up making your way

2207
02:55:07,158 --> 02:55:11,495
back to the group, and you see the (squish)
footfalls of both of your tiny gnome friends.

2208
02:55:11,495 --> 02:55:15,182
TALIESIN: I am watching that hag through my scope
with everything I've got.

2209
02:55:15,182 --> 02:55:19,520
MATT: From your perspective, you can't really see
anything through the window. You're just going off

2210
02:55:19,520 --> 02:55:23,756
of what they've told you, which has been very
little. You're looking into the side of the

2211
02:55:23,756 --> 02:55:26,892
window, and all you see is a little bit of flicker
of firelight. That's it.

2212
02:55:26,892 --> 02:55:30,107
ASHLEY: I go up to Vex and I give her her broom.

2213
02:55:30,107 --> 02:55:31,942
LAURA: (relieved noises)

2214
02:55:31,942 --> 02:55:45,470
(cheering)

2215
02:55:45,470 --> 02:55:50,726
TRAVIS: What did you find? Oh. 
(whispering) What did you find?

2216
02:55:50,726 --> 02:55:55,183
ASHLEY: There's a woman. It looked like it was
really nice, and then there was this really cute

2217
02:55:55,183 --> 02:55:58,019
tea set, and then this crazy hand came out.

2218
02:55:58,019 --> 02:56:01,735
TRAVIS: That sounds terrible.

2219
02:56:01,735 --> 02:56:03,668
ASHLEY: She looks really scary.

2220
02:56:03,668 --> 02:56:07,514
MARISHA: Was she really tall? 
Do you know if she was tall?

2221
02:56:07,514 --> 02:56:09,910
ASHLEY: The chair was really big. 
I mean, anybody's tall to us.

2222
02:56:09,910 --> 02:56:11,448
MARISHA: That is true.

2223
02:56:11,448 --> 02:56:17,621
ASHLEY: Yeah, she was very large.

2224
02:56:17,621 --> 02:56:20,605
TRAVIS: Super important question: 
Did they see you?

2225
02:56:20,605 --> 02:56:23,668
ASHLEY: I think probably.

2226
02:56:23,668 --> 02:56:27,126
SAM: Well, the broom stopped flying.

2227
02:56:27,126 --> 02:56:28,597
LAURA: What do you mean?

2228
02:56:28,597 --> 02:56:29,831
TALIESIN: Run.

2229
02:56:29,831 --> 02:56:31,362
LAURA: What?

2230
02:56:31,362 --> 02:56:33,028
TRAVIS: Are you saying we should hide, Percy?

2231
02:56:33,028 --> 02:56:34,112
TALIESIN: We should go.

2232
02:56:34,112 --> 02:56:35,283
TRAVIS: Where?

2233
02:56:35,283 --> 02:56:42,423
MATT: Clutching the broom in your hands, as you
emit the phrase that you've known to bring it to

2234
02:56:42,423 --> 02:56:44,129
vibrant magical life...

2235
02:56:44,129 --> 02:56:46,554
(groaning)

2236
02:56:46,554 --> 02:56:47,878
MARISHA: Oh no.

2237
02:56:47,878 --> 02:57:03,532
(laughter)

2238
02:57:03,532 --> 02:57:05,107
MATT: The broom jumps to life.

2239
02:57:05,107 --> 02:57:26,783
(cheering and laughter)

2240
02:57:26,783 --> 02:57:33,010
LAURA: Thank you, Matt, for saving a marriage.

2241
02:57:33,010 --> 02:57:39,546
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

2242
02:57:39,546 --> 02:57:48,730
MATT: And there, backing up from this abode in the
center of the Shademirk bog, your broom retrieved,

2243
02:57:48,730 --> 02:57:53,991
your party members gathered, looking towards that
glowing window, and now the ajar door inviting you

2244
02:57:53,991 --> 02:57:57,384
in to some degree, we'll pick this up next
session.

2245
02:57:57,384 --> 02:58:51,755
(cheering and applause)

2246
02:58:51,755 --> 02:58:55,718
MATT: Well, that was fun. Thank you guys so much
for joining us for this. We're going to go ahead

2247
02:58:55,718 --> 02:59:00,102
and take a few minutes here and do a short Q and A
with those of you guys we have here in the stage

2248
02:59:00,102 --> 02:59:07,244
before we need to clean up here, and we'll do the
meet and greet upstairs. That being the case, do

2249
02:59:07,244 --> 02:59:10,079
we have a set-up over there with the microphone to
ask questions?

2250
02:59:10,079 --> 02:59:12,682
SAM: Have we stopped broadcasting?

2251
02:59:12,682 --> 02:59:15,216
MATT: Oh, that's right.

2252
02:59:15,216 --> 02:59:18,103
LAURA: Dude, you have to say good-bye.

2253
02:59:18,103 --> 02:59:21,870
MATT: That's right. Well, before we begin this Q
and A, I want to thank you all for watching and

2254
02:59:21,870 --> 02:59:29,979
tuning in. Thank you all so much. We'll be back
next week, Thursday at our regular time slot and

2255
02:59:29,979 --> 02:59:40,157
schedule. Thank you for joining us this Saturday,
and yeah. Is it Thursday yet?
