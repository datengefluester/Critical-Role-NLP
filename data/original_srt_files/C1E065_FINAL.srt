1
00:00:00,163 --> 00:00:01,520
TALIESIN: Pissblossom.

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,121
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where Taliesin jumps the

3
00:00:05,121 --> 00:00:07,295
gun and says his phrase too late.

4
00:00:07,295 --> 00:00:10,142
TRAVIS: Way too late, man! Way too late!

5
00:00:10,142 --> 00:00:16,059
MATT: Welcome. Happy to be back. Very emotional
episode last week. We're going to kick it into the

6
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:21,266
next step of Vox Machina's adventure this week,
and then, me, Marisha, and Taliesin will be gone

7
00:00:21,266 --> 00:00:26,561
next week, so there will not be progression in
this current storyline. However, Liam O'Brien over

8
00:00:26,561 --> 00:00:31,673
there has been cracking up an awesome one-shot
adventure for our remaining players and a few

9
00:00:31,673 --> 00:00:33,759
guests. Liam, if you want to talk a little about
it?

10
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:36,799
LIAM: Yeah, I'll tell you who's coming on by.
Sure, I'll say who's coming on by. Mary Elizabeth

11
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:48,396
McGlynn and Ashly Burch. And I don't want to spoil
it, but Matt knows. It's different.

12
00:00:48,396 --> 00:00:55,377
MATT: Yeah, it's going to be fun. This is Liam's
brainchild, and I'm excited to see them play

13
00:00:55,377 --> 00:00:56,840
through it.

14
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,768
LIAM: It could blow up in my face.

15
00:00:58,768 --> 00:01:06,895
MATT: I think you'll be fine. If the last game was
any indication, I think you'll be fine. All right,

16
00:01:06,895 --> 00:01:13,117
other announcements: once again, we have our
wonderful sponsor with a new theme kicking in.

17
00:01:13,117 --> 00:01:14,911
Sam, you want to take this away?

18
00:01:14,911 --> 00:01:22,645
SAM: Yes, I do, Matt Mercer. Guys: Loot Crate.
Loot Crate has been such a great sponsor all year

19
00:01:22,645 --> 00:01:29,106
long, and we got another great week to share with
you. Speed is this month's theme of the Loot

20
00:01:29,106 --> 00:01:33,666
Crate. I'm going to read this script first. Lace
up your sneakers or rev your engines. September's

21
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:40,680
all about speed. Feel the adrenaline with some of
pop culture's quickest vehicles and characters.

22
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:47,841
High-octane assortment of goodies from Batman, the
Flash, the Arrow, the Battlestar Galactica, the

23
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:50,835
Iron Man, the Gone in the Sixty the Seconds.

24
00:01:50,835 --> 00:01:52,994
(laughter)

25
00:01:52,994 --> 00:01:56,649
SAM: It includes two collectibles, a figure, and
as always, a monthly t-shirt. I'm wearing a

26
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:58,334
t-shirt. Not from this month, but from last
month.

27
00:01:58,334 --> 00:01:59,870
LAURA: It's got Futurama stuff on it.

28
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:07,814
SAM: Guys, I'm an actor. Why would you listen to
me about this stuff? I'm a liar and a deceiver.

29
00:02:07,814 --> 00:02:14,407
But what you can listen to, and what you know in
your heart, is hardcore facts. I'm talking

30
00:02:14,407 --> 00:02:21,654
statistics. I'm talking math. I've broken this
down for you guys. If you use the promo-code

31
00:02:21,654 --> 00:02:27,407
CriticalRole, you'll get $3 off your first month.
Doesn't sound like a lot, you think? Oh, that's

32
00:02:27,407 --> 00:02:33,414
1.2 gallons of gas at the Quik Mart down the
street. Regular, unleaded. Or let's say you're

33
00:02:33,414 --> 00:02:39,101
generous. You give Loot Crates to everyone in your
family. That's four Loot Crates; that's $12. That

34
00:02:39,101 --> 00:02:45,273
is 25 and half Forever stamps that you've just
gotten for free. For free! Let's say you're more

35
00:02:45,273 --> 00:02:52,022
generous than that. You give Loot Crates to
everyone in your whole company. All 266 employees.

36
00:02:52,022 --> 00:03:00,761
You've just saved enough money to buy a 2002 Kia
Sedona with 181,000 miles on it. The transmission

37
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:08,640
is going out, and it doesn't shift in the higher
gears, but it is for $800 on Craigslist. Go look

38
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:15,582
for it right now, and it will be yours for free,
essentially, if you buy 266 subscriptions to Loot

39
00:03:15,582 --> 00:03:24,707
Crate. 266.67. Okay, that is <i>hardcore facts.</i> You
can't argue with that. Go out. Subscribe now. Save

40
00:03:24,707 --> 00:03:28,007
money. Get stamps and gas.

41
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:32,883
LIAM: If you don't slow your roll, Loot Crate is
going to poach you.

42
00:03:32,883 --> 00:03:37,175
MATT: All right, thank you, Sam.

43
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:40,492
SAM: Don't forget to use the promo code
CriticalRole.

44
00:03:40,492 --> 00:03:49,943
MATT: Perfect. (laughs) All right, other
announcements that we have. Let's see. Projects

45
00:03:49,943 --> 00:03:56,417
that have come up. They recently announced and put
up the English cast video for Final Fantasy XV. I

46
00:03:56,417 --> 00:04:01,376
have the pleasure of playing Cor Leonis. It's a
lot of fun. As a longtime Final Fantasy fan, being

47
00:04:01,376 --> 00:04:05,874
a part of this means a great deal, and I'm excited
for the game that comes out in November. So if you

48
00:04:05,874 --> 00:04:10,007
haven't checked out the video, do so and you can
watch me wax poetic briefly about my love of the

49
00:04:10,007 --> 00:04:11,758
series. Look forward to that.

50
00:04:11,758 --> 00:04:13,367
MARISHA: Soundbiting it up in that.

51
00:04:13,367 --> 00:04:17,771
MATT: Yeah, man! They chose my soundbite for the
end of it. I was like (explosion). Felt cool about that.

52
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:19,195
MARISHA: It's like you're an actor.

53
00:04:19,195 --> 00:04:26,706
MATT: It's like I played a bunch of them. Also,
Deus Ex came out. Mankind Divided. I am scattered

54
00:04:26,706 --> 00:04:31,395
throughout the game with a very harsh Russian,
Eastern European dialect, as many characters,

55
00:04:31,395 --> 00:04:34,598
probably yelling at you or being shot in the face.
So enjoy that, as well.

56
00:04:34,598 --> 00:04:36,782
TRAVIS: I love shooting you in the face.

57
00:04:36,782 --> 00:04:41,873
MATT: Hey, you know? Everyone's got a skillset.
Anybody else have anything they want to announce?

58
00:04:41,873 --> 00:04:44,039
SAM: We're nominated for an award, Matt.

59
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:50,773
MATT: That's right! We just got nominated for a
Streamy. A Streamy award under gaming. Games. It's

60
00:04:50,773 --> 00:04:51,923
awesome!

61
00:04:51,923 --> 00:04:53,430
SAM: It's our first nomination.

62
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,417
TALIESIN: It's like the Kids' Choice Awards for
adults.

63
00:04:55,417 --> 00:04:57,144
LAURA: But it's not. Fans don't get to vote.

64
00:04:57,144 --> 00:05:02,869
MATT: It is now decided by whatever the Illuminati
Streamy committee is.

65
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:07,910
SAM: Wait, fans don't get to vote? I'm sure they
can influence things.

66
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:17,274
MARISHA: Well, they nominated us, so we got this
far because of them, and now we lose to

67
00:05:17,274 --> 00:05:18,591
Markiplier.

68
00:05:18,591 --> 00:05:27,668
MATT: Love you, Mark. We're just excited to be in
that ring. Thank you guys for being so awesome and

69
00:05:27,668 --> 00:05:32,922
supporting us, and hopefully some of us will get
to dress up fancy and show up and go home proud

70
00:05:32,922 --> 00:05:34,621
that we went.

71
00:05:34,621 --> 00:05:38,985
TALIESIN: We'll plug our other friends who
are also nominated.

72
00:05:38,985 --> 00:05:45,107
MATT: And Muzzled the Musical, which I co-created,
which Ashly Burch stars in, who you'll see next

73
00:05:45,107 --> 00:05:48,360
week, that got nominated for best indie.

74
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:55,138
MARISHA: And Sean Becker. Who's my director for
Signal Boost. All in the fam.

75
00:05:55,138 --> 00:05:59,675
MATT: It's good. Awesome. Anything else you guys
want to talk about?

76
00:05:59,675 --> 00:06:05,622
TRAVIS: Yes! In the world of sportsball, the 2016
future Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys are

77
00:06:05,622 --> 00:06:13,860
playing the Seattle Seahawks right now! So if you
see me looking down, it's not because I'm not

78
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,054
paying attention. I'm watching football.

79
00:06:17,054 --> 00:06:20,121
TALIESIN: I have never cared so much about
football in my entire life as I do right now.

80
00:06:20,121 --> 00:06:24,364
Which is saying, I don't necessarily care a lot.
But definitely--

81
00:06:24,364 --> 00:06:26,321
LAURA: More than it was.

82
00:06:26,321 --> 00:06:34,375
TRAVIS: Everybody send Sam a tweet. He's going to
be crying at the outset of his team. Sam, a moment

83
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:35,848
of silence.

84
00:06:35,848 --> 00:06:38,025
TALIESIN: I think he's lighting the set on fire.

85
00:06:38,025 --> 00:06:42,334
LAURA: Sam walked away so he wouldn't be on the
same set as you were saying that.

86
00:06:42,334 --> 00:06:48,671
MATT: Anyone else have anything they want to talk
about before we jump into the game?

87
00:06:48,671 --> 00:06:51,393
TALIESIN: No announcements until I get back, I
think.

88
00:06:51,393 --> 00:06:55,114
MATT: All righty. That being the case, then let's
go ahead and hop into tonight's episode of

89
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:57,665
Critical Role.

90
00:06:57,721 --> 00:08:26,136
[dramatic music]

91
00:08:26,198 --> 00:08:33,293
MATT: Hello, and welcome back. So to get you guys
caught up: our band of adventurers, Vox Machina,

92
00:08:33,293 --> 00:08:41,444
in raising an army, hopefully, of allies and
powerful artifacts to face the Chroma Conclave, a

93
00:08:41,444 --> 00:08:47,684
gathering of powerful, dangerous chromatic dragons
that have been tearing through the countryside of

94
00:08:47,684 --> 00:08:56,260
Tal'Dorei and distant Wildemount. They have
recently found some information, had a close call

95
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:02,506
with the Frigid Doom known as Vorugal. The white
dragon flyover did not pierce through the

96
00:09:02,506 --> 00:09:09,833
illusionary barrier that was placed with the help
of Allura, Gilmore, and Pike, there in Whitestone.

97
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:14,970
You then decided to go ahead and using that cue,
before the dragon returned to its current roost

98
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:21,222
that it has created over the ruins of the city of
Draconia, you traveled across to the continent of

99
00:09:21,222 --> 00:09:22,523
Wildemount.

100
00:09:22,523 --> 00:09:31,776
You had a meeting with the Ravenites, a rather
subverted, long-enslaved offshoot species of

101
00:09:31,776 --> 00:09:39,607
dragonborn kin, tailless and now surviving amongst
a recent winter that seems to have come with the

102
00:09:39,607 --> 00:09:46,016
ruin the dragon brought. You also discovered
that most of Draconia and its royal elite have

103
00:09:46,016 --> 00:09:51,962
been slaughtered as a means of the dragon
establishing its dominance and the worship of the

104
00:09:51,962 --> 00:09:55,016
Ravenites that survived the fall of Draconia.

105
00:09:55,016 --> 00:10:03,321
You made a deal with Tooma, the current clan
leader of the remaining Ravenites, that you would

106
00:10:03,321 --> 00:10:11,848
aid in destroying this dragon, basically the
master that they replaced the Draconians with when

107
00:10:11,848 --> 00:10:18,612
it came. However, to ensure your help there was a
two-week time limit, and if you do not return

108
00:10:18,612 --> 00:10:22,233
before then they would see you as not keeping your
end of the deal, and they would then, instead,

109
00:10:22,233 --> 00:10:27,701
direct the dragon towards what was going to be
Whitestone until you altered her memory, which she

110
00:10:27,701 --> 00:10:29,669
recalls now as Emon.

111
00:10:29,669 --> 00:10:37,280
Anyway, before you could be finding your way home,
one of the corpses upon one of the ice spire

112
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:44,140
spikes outside of the dragon's new nest, Percy saw
to be the remains of your long-traveled friend,

113
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:49,320
Tiberius Stormwind. The party had a fateful
farewell; set him to rest within the ruins of the

114
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:55,592
nearby library, fallen from the islands of
Draconia; said your goodbyes; and then, upon

115
00:10:55,592 --> 00:11:00,053
prepping a bit, plotting, and planning, found your
way back to Whitestone to continue the next leg of

116
00:11:00,053 --> 00:11:01,428
your adventure.

117
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:06,593
And that is where we begin. You have now taken
some time in your own respective rooms. It's still

118
00:11:06,593 --> 00:11:11,994
late afternoon, going into dusk. You all took some
time to yourselves within Castle Whitestone to

119
00:11:11,994 --> 00:11:21,116
take a short rest and ruminate over these recent
events and reveals. The evening sun draws close to

120
00:11:21,116 --> 00:11:27,200
dusk. It is your choice which you wish to do. If
you wish to spend the evening resting here and

121
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,872
then leaving first thing in the morning, that is
up to you.

122
00:11:29,872 --> 00:11:40,323
LIAM: Taking the initiative. This one came to my
room, then inside. I think we've probably been

123
00:11:40,323 --> 00:11:52,282
quiet for a while, staring at the ceiling, and
after a while finally say: We've really fucked

124
00:11:52,282 --> 00:11:55,760
things up, haven't we?

125
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:01,397
MARISHA: In which particular way do you mean,
aside from all of them?

126
00:12:01,397 --> 00:12:23,522
LIAM: I need to tell you. I know with all that's
happened, between my new patron and my sister

127
00:12:23,522 --> 00:12:33,884
pretending to gag literally every time we attempt
to share a word together, and mostly my own being

128
00:12:33,884 --> 00:12:53,853
fucked up in the head for weeks now, that I've
pushed all of you away. You most of all. Because

129
00:12:53,853 --> 00:13:15,048
I've been afraid you would-- I'm sorry. And you
didn't deserve any of that. Keyleth, I need you to

130
00:13:15,048 --> 00:13:39,107
know, through all of that, everything, nothing has changed 
about how I-- We've had so many near-misses. And now,

131
00:13:39,107 --> 00:13:58,535
finding Tiberius. Death is unavoidable. And it's
all the more reason for life to be lived. And it

132
00:13:58,535 --> 00:14:12,160
doesn't matter to me what this is. What we call
it. If you are willing to spend some time, any

133
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:28,105
time, with me, then I will simply count myself
lucky to have it. You're very dear to me.

134
00:14:28,105 --> 00:14:43,984
MARISHA: You're talking too much. It's not like
I've made myself very accessible either. It's not

135
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:56,317
on you. It might be a little on you, but it's on
both of us. Anyway, my point is: for the longest

136
00:14:56,317 --> 00:15:07,488
time, I was terrified that I was going to lose
you. First to death and then to the Raven Queen,

137
00:15:07,488 --> 00:15:22,350
which is still kind of like death, and then ultimately to
yourself. And then I had an interesting talk with

138
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:34,360
Pike recently, and she said something that really
stood out to me, and that was that some people

139
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:42,117
just have more of themselves to give. And I
realized this whole time that I was afraid of

140
00:15:42,117 --> 00:15:55,299
losing you to a future that ultimately has not yet
been written, which is stupid.

141
00:15:55,299 --> 00:15:59,380
LIAM: Maybe so.

142
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:27,568
MARISHA: But you're ultimately right. We have
nothing to lose. I love you, Vax. And I'm sorry

143
00:16:27,568 --> 00:16:35,200
for being me, that it took me this long to say it.

144
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:48,963
LIAM: (sniffles) I'm sorry.

145
00:16:48,963 --> 00:16:51,569
MARISHA: Yeah. Me, too.

146
00:16:51,569 --> 00:17:01,026
LIAM: I love you. That's pretty fucking great.

147
00:17:01,026 --> 00:17:06,353
MARISHA: That is pretty great, yeah. High five.
Yeah!

148
00:17:06,353 --> 00:17:14,086
LIAM: I tackle her into a bit of a hug into the
bed.

149
00:17:14,086 --> 00:17:15,509
LAURA: Oh!

150
00:17:15,509 --> 00:17:17,450
LIAM: We're already on the bed.

151
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:26,235
MARISHA: And that's it for now.

152
00:17:26,235 --> 00:17:29,898
SAM: Pan to the fireplace.

153
00:17:29,898 --> 00:17:33,855
TRAVIS: (laughing) Pan to the fireplace!

154
00:17:33,855 --> 00:17:46,275
MATT: All right, so. Vox Machina. Taking your time
to mourn in your own interesting ways. What is

155
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:50,554
your path of action? What is your course, going
forward?

156
00:17:50,554 --> 00:17:52,074
LIAM: Sleeping in.

157
00:17:52,074 --> 00:17:53,898
MARISHA: Bacon.

158
00:17:53,898 --> 00:18:02,617
LAURA: Yeah, I think we need to spend at least the
night in Whitestone and get up in the morning.

159
00:18:02,617 --> 00:18:11,303
MATT: Okay. So you've all spent the majority of it
in your respective rooms-- most of you in your

160
00:18:11,303 --> 00:18:20,061
respective rooms-- figuring out where you are as a
person and where this story leads you. After an

161
00:18:20,061 --> 00:18:23,712
evening's rest, the next morning comes around,
breakfast is already prepared by the servants in

162
00:18:23,712 --> 00:18:28,572
the castle, though maybe not the amount of bacon
you were hoping, and easily rectified upon

163
00:18:28,572 --> 00:18:36,680
request. It's at your disposal. There is a tension
in the city; the barrier remains up.

164
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:46,336
As you're having breakfast, you can see Zahra
wander in at the smell of bacon, glances over the

165
00:18:46,336 --> 00:18:53,466
rest of you, still holding a book at her side that
she slams closed. "Oh. I'm glad to see you're all

166
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:57,256
"right, and you're safe. Please tell me there's
more bacon."

167
00:18:57,256 --> 00:18:59,387
TRAVIS: Not for long.

168
00:18:59,387 --> 00:19:02,418
LAURA: There's more coming, dear.

169
00:19:02,418 --> 00:19:04,214
TRAVIS: What she said.

170
00:19:04,214 --> 00:19:08,684
MATT: She comes and sits down and spends breakfast
with you guys, catching up on what has transpired

171
00:19:08,684 --> 00:19:11,038
and what your current plan of action is.

172
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:19,225
TALIESIN: Zahra, it occurs to me, you come from a
family with power, connections.

173
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:27,169
MATT: "Kind of. Let's just say we're estranged at
the moment."

174
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:33,158
TALIESIN: Well, we're looking for any ally we
could, and we were curious if--

175
00:19:33,158 --> 00:19:38,686
MATT: "You will find no allies where you're
asking. Believe me, I'd be happy to offer if we

176
00:19:38,686 --> 00:19:40,798
"could, but no."

177
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:43,956
TALIESIN: I had a feeling. It just felt worth
asking.

178
00:19:43,956 --> 00:19:50,214
MATT: "It's all right. I'm going to continue with
my research, since the rest of the ziggurat clan

179
00:19:50,214 --> 00:19:55,085
"are now scattered about or maintaining that
barrier. Guess who has to do the research in the

180
00:19:55,085 --> 00:20:02,401
"meantime?" And she rolls her sleeves up; you can
see the slightly smudged dirt across her reddish

181
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:06,921
skin. She's been hard at work digging around
trying to figure out what the basis of this

182
00:20:06,921 --> 00:20:09,481
enchantment beneath the city still is.

183
00:20:09,481 --> 00:20:12,123
LAURA: Sorry you can't be out having your fun,
dear.

184
00:20:12,123 --> 00:20:18,766
MATT: "I'm certain time will allow me at some
point. It better. I'm going a little stir-crazy."

185
00:20:18,766 --> 00:20:23,114
She grabs the bacon from the table and walks out
of the room.

186
00:20:23,114 --> 00:20:25,897
TALIESIN: Is Kashaw around by any chance, as
well?

187
00:20:25,897 --> 00:20:27,507
MATT: "I'm sorry, what?"

188
00:20:27,507 --> 00:20:29,834
TALIESIN: Kashaw. Is Kashaw around?

189
00:20:29,834 --> 00:20:34,963
MATT: "I haven't seen him for a couple days. I've
been underground most of the time."

190
00:20:34,963 --> 00:20:42,712
TALIESIN: Yes, of course. We have to send a letter
to the Slayer's Take at some point. That should

191
00:20:42,712 --> 00:20:44,741
happen sooner rather than later.

192
00:20:44,741 --> 00:20:46,515
MARISHA: Trying to wrangle a beast?

193
00:20:46,515 --> 00:20:49,136
TALIESIN: Trying to wrangle a beast or seeing if
they know of anything that's in the vicinity that

194
00:20:49,136 --> 00:20:51,182
we can at least feed to it in the meantime.

195
00:20:51,182 --> 00:20:55,090
LAURA: Maybe we can stop through on our way back.
We are going to Marquet, aren't we?

196
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:56,455
TALIESIN: I would hope so.

197
00:20:56,455 --> 00:21:01,719
MARISHA: And what's our intent in Marquet? To get
the next Vestige?

198
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:07,539
TALIESIN: To get to the next Vestige and to
perhaps make some friends. The more the merrier.

199
00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:09,876
LIAM: And the means of travel is?

200
00:21:09,876 --> 00:21:12,305
TALIESIN: We have a sigil. We can teleport.

201
00:21:12,305 --> 00:21:17,394
LAURA: Gilmore. Gilmore's from Marquet.

202
00:21:17,394 --> 00:21:20,916
TALIESIN: This is a teleport sigil. This is not
going to require his attention.

203
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:25,984
MARISHA: Yeah, it's located in Whitestone Castle,
correct? The teleport sigil?

204
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:31,987
MATT: It's actually a sigil by memory that he has,
and it's a spell that he casts. It's not a

205
00:21:31,987 --> 00:21:33,932
permanent fixture in the city.

206
00:21:33,932 --> 00:21:35,840
TALIESIN: So we need him, but he can do it.

207
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,607
SAM: Yeah, but he's concentrating on the defensive
wall right now.

208
00:21:39,607 --> 00:21:44,802
LAURA: It's up. As long as the dragon's not here
and attacking.

209
00:21:44,802 --> 00:21:50,050
MATT: It's a renewal feature. He has to spend some
time each day maintaining it. He's not stuck there

210
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,478
the whole time.

211
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:53,105
SAM: That would be awesome.

212
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:56,390
TALIESIN: The worst job in Whitestone.

213
00:21:56,390 --> 00:22:06,760
SAM: Before we go to Marquet. Let's say Marquet
takes 13 days.

214
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,718
TALIESIN: That's an awful long time.

215
00:22:08,718 --> 00:22:16,057
SAM: I agree, but let's say it does. Do we know
what we're doing with regards to Draconia when we

216
00:22:16,057 --> 00:22:20,470
come back? Do we have some sort of a plan? We're
getting a beast. That's all we know.

217
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:23,663
TRAVIS: Yep, we've got it covered. It's planned
out to a T.

218
00:22:23,663 --> 00:22:27,477
LAURA: How are we even going to get a beast?

219
00:22:27,477 --> 00:22:32,305
TALIESIN: Talk to the Slayer's Take and see what
is already on the continent.

220
00:22:32,305 --> 00:22:37,364
SAM: What constitutes a beast? Because me and
Keyleth can make some beasts.

221
00:22:37,364 --> 00:22:41,031
LAURA: I think a large enough beast to attract
Vorugal.

222
00:22:41,031 --> 00:22:43,020
SAM: Like a triceratops?

223
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,186
TALIESIN: No.

224
00:22:44,186 --> 00:22:50,619
MARISHA: They said it hunted something really
intense recently.

225
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:53,409
LAURA: He said they hunted remorhaz?

226
00:22:53,409 --> 00:22:55,192
MARISHA: Yeah, they went to the ocean.

227
00:22:55,192 --> 00:22:56,654
SAM: What is that?

228
00:22:56,654 --> 00:23:01,171
MATT: Roll an intelligence check.

229
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,085
MARISHA: But I wrote it down.

230
00:23:03,085 --> 00:23:09,752
SAM: For me. Ooh, a 19! Plus two.

231
00:23:09,752 --> 00:23:16,228
MATT: That's what they look like.

232
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:19,922
LAURA: Oh. Those are big and scary.

233
00:23:19,922 --> 00:23:21,940
SAM: Is it a gargantuan monster?

234
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:33,412
MATT: They're huge. Most definitely. They're
nasty; they burrow. The actual blood within their

235
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:41,349
body is heated to such a degree that even to be in
a scuffle with it is to scar yourself with flame

236
00:23:41,349 --> 00:23:42,684
and heat.

237
00:23:42,684 --> 00:23:44,307
SAM: And it was bored with that?

238
00:23:44,307 --> 00:23:48,821
TALIESIN: We want to find a creature that would
threaten a medium-sized city.

239
00:23:48,821 --> 00:23:53,192
MARISHA: So it wants competition.

240
00:23:53,192 --> 00:23:58,592
TALIESIN: We want to wear it down a bit before we
go in for the attack. We want it to be breathing

241
00:23:58,592 --> 00:24:00,299
heavily.

242
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:02,899
SAM: And how are we going to get this creature
there?

243
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:04,925
TALIESIN: We're going to find something that's
already on the continent.

244
00:24:04,925 --> 00:24:07,302
LAURA: And Vorugal will go to the creature.

245
00:24:07,302 --> 00:24:08,803
TALIESIN: He will be happy to attack it.

246
00:24:08,803 --> 00:24:10,599
TRAVIS: Can you put it in your necklace?

247
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:12,972
SAM: On the continent. What continent? The
Draconian continent?

248
00:24:12,972 --> 00:24:13,984
TALIESIN: Yes.

249
00:24:13,984 --> 00:24:15,636
SAM: So we have to go back there to search!

250
00:24:15,636 --> 00:24:20,447
MARISHA: The Slayer's Take should know. They've
got contracts everywhere.

251
00:24:20,447 --> 00:24:23,379
SAM: All right. This is slightly a better plan
than I thought.

252
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:26,383
MARISHA: We thought about it a little.

253
00:24:26,383 --> 00:24:28,637
TALIESIN: Six people cannot wage a war.

254
00:24:28,637 --> 00:24:31,990
SAM: Then we should go talk to the Slayer's Take
now so they can get started on this hunt.

255
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,797
TALIESIN: We're going to send them a letter.

256
00:24:33,797 --> 00:24:35,002
SAM: A letter?!

257
00:24:35,002 --> 00:24:36,026
TALIESIN: Yes.

258
00:24:36,026 --> 00:24:40,894
SAM: Who's the letter carrier and how's he going
to get out of this city that's protected by an

259
00:24:40,894 --> 00:24:41,943
invisible wall?

260
00:24:41,943 --> 00:24:43,636
TALIESIN: We're going to make Kashaw take the
letter.

261
00:24:43,636 --> 00:24:47,907
LIAM: When we were last there, hadn't they talked
about a brass or bronze dragon? But there are

262
00:24:47,907 --> 00:24:50,674
brass dragons, as you well know.

263
00:24:50,674 --> 00:24:52,551
LAURA: I know, because I'm an expert.

264
00:24:52,551 --> 00:24:57,155
LIAM: Is that overkill? We'd have to convince a
dragon, not capture a dragon.

265
00:24:57,155 --> 00:25:00,105
TALIESIN: It would probably kill the dragon.

266
00:25:00,105 --> 00:25:06,341
MARISHA: Wait, are we talking about capturing
another dragon to fight another dragon?

267
00:25:06,341 --> 00:25:10,551
SAM: No, we're talking about convincing a dragon
to go fight this dragon that would clearly kill it.

268
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:14,928
TALIESIN: I was going to find Kashaw and see if he
would run the letter to the Slayer's Take and be

269
00:25:14,928 --> 00:25:21,096
our emissary and convince them to do this so that
we're not doing everything ourselves.

270
00:25:21,096 --> 00:25:27,683
SAM: Wait, is there anyone else who can make this
message delivery faster or safer?

271
00:25:27,683 --> 00:25:33,742
TALIESIN: Literally everyone. If we could find a
child in a pub who could take it.

272
00:25:33,742 --> 00:25:35,989
SAM: No, but faster and safer.

273
00:25:35,989 --> 00:25:38,615
TALIESIN: Kashaw is possibly slower than a child.

274
00:25:38,615 --> 00:25:41,637
MARISHA: No more small boys, Percy. No more.

275
00:25:41,637 --> 00:25:44,421
LAURA: We could ask Zahra, but she's busy with
research.

276
00:25:44,421 --> 00:25:49,640
TRAVIS: I think Kashaw is a great people-person.

277
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,068
TALIESIN: Just to get rid of him, they would say
yes.

278
00:25:52,068 --> 00:25:53,363
SAM: All right.

279
00:25:53,363 --> 00:25:55,842
LIAM: He wants to help. He does.

280
00:25:55,842 --> 00:25:57,613
LAURA: Yeah. Let's go find Kashaw.

281
00:25:57,613 --> 00:26:06,272
MATT: You guys head outside of Castle Whitestone.
Not far from the base of the pathway into the

282
00:26:06,272 --> 00:26:13,091
actual city, you can see there is a series of
newer-outfitted guards. They are people being

283
00:26:13,091 --> 00:26:18,660
trained in the force of combat. You can see that
there's definitely a ramping-up of the defense

284
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,018
force for Whitestone as a precaution.

285
00:26:21,018 --> 00:26:23,766
MARISHA: Do they look like townspeople?

286
00:26:23,766 --> 00:26:30,163
MATT: Many of them look able-bodied and people
that are strong and fit, but they do appear to be

287
00:26:30,163 --> 00:26:32,668
civilians that have had to take up the cause just
in case.

288
00:26:32,668 --> 00:26:34,102
MARISHA: Any kids?

289
00:26:34,102 --> 00:26:39,888
MATT: No kids, no. They all look to be at least of
strapping age, to be carrying a weapon.

290
00:26:39,888 --> 00:26:42,714
SAM: Strapping boys?

291
00:26:42,714 --> 00:26:45,138
TALIESIN: Strapping. The strapping age.

292
00:26:45,138 --> 00:26:51,947
LAURA: Did we ever talk to Cassandra or anyone
else about starting an alarm system here?

293
00:26:51,947 --> 00:26:54,847
SAM: Yeah, and they were working on it already,
weren't they?

294
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:57,306
TALIESIN: No, they started. They are working on it
now.

295
00:26:57,306 --> 00:27:03,186
SAM: I think it's done.
TALIESIN: I'd buy that. Yes, it was proposed.

296
00:27:03,186 --> 00:27:05,738
MARISHA: I do want to maybe talk to Gilmore,
though.

297
00:27:05,738 --> 00:27:08,123
TALIESIN: Well, we're going to have to if we
leave the city, anyway.

298
00:27:08,123 --> 00:27:12,825
MATT: As you are watching the group go through
their different weapon practice moments, they're

299
00:27:12,825 --> 00:27:16,909
breaking off into small sparring groups and
they're going up against ramshackle built

300
00:27:16,909 --> 00:27:22,560
training dummies. There are a few that are doing
forms in succession. (grunts) You know the deal.

301
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:27,128
You do see on the opposite end that the person who
is currently helming one section of the training

302
00:27:27,128 --> 00:27:32,566
is Kashaw. You can see a bunch of shield and spear
fighters right now, and he's basically giving them

303
00:27:32,566 --> 00:27:36,908
instruction on how to use a shield defensively and
the spear offensively simultaneously.

304
00:27:36,908 --> 00:27:39,974
LAURA: Maybe he's not the best messenger if he's
training our armies.

305
00:27:39,974 --> 00:27:46,709
TALIESIN: This is not an army. This is something
for the population to do while they pass time. The

306
00:27:46,709 --> 00:27:50,333
dragon shows up, they're all going to die, no
matter how many times they learn how to put the

307
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:51,740
spear forward.

308
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:55,019
MARISHA: As cynical as Percy is being right now,
he's right.

309
00:27:55,019 --> 00:27:58,321
LAURA: All right.

310
00:27:58,321 --> 00:28:03,030
MARISHA: But it doesn't mean that Kashaw is going
to think that it's any less important, and I'm

311
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:09,851
sure he might not take it as a compliment if we
ask him to be the messenger boy.

312
00:28:09,851 --> 00:28:12,370
SAM: It's an incredibly important mission!

313
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:16,586
LAURA: It's not just a messenger, it's defeating a
dragon.

314
00:28:16,586 --> 00:28:20,209
TALIESIN: And it's convincing the Slayer's Take to
join.

315
00:28:20,209 --> 00:28:25,523
SAM: The Slayer's Take, if I recall, doesn't do
things for free. We're going to have to pay for

316
00:28:25,523 --> 00:28:27,185
this, even though we're members.

317
00:28:27,185 --> 00:28:29,375
TALIESIN: We're going to have to bring them some
dragon parts.

318
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:35,607
LAURA: No, we take a contract on a really large
creature, and then we let the dragon do the work

319
00:28:35,607 --> 00:28:37,750
for us. We get the best of both worlds.

320
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:40,071
TALIESIN: Ooh, that's very clever.

321
00:28:40,071 --> 00:28:48,036
SAM: We take a contract on an existing creature
that we have to somehow find in Draconia.

322
00:28:48,036 --> 00:28:51,434
TRAVIS: No, we bring the dragon to the creature.

323
00:28:51,434 --> 00:28:52,674
SAM: How?

324
00:28:52,674 --> 00:28:57,476
LAURA: He hunts them. That's what he does.

325
00:28:57,476 --> 00:28:59,184
SAM: Not transcontinentally.

326
00:28:59,184 --> 00:29:02,066
TRAVIS: You can't broker a fight between a huge
beast and a white dragon?

327
00:29:02,066 --> 00:29:03,629
TALIESIN: We could sell tickets.

328
00:29:03,629 --> 00:29:05,684
TRAVIS: I think you've done better.

329
00:29:05,684 --> 00:29:11,791
LIAM: We don't necessarily have to sacrifice a
dragon. We're fighting a war here. They're fuckers.

330
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:14,728
SAM: No, we're not talking about sacrificing a
dragon. We're talking about finding a beast.

331
00:29:14,728 --> 00:29:18,746
LIAM: Well, I'm talking about a dragon. Couldn't
we try to talk a dragon into helping us do what

332
00:29:18,746 --> 00:29:21,351
we're doing? They're not all evil, are they?
They're not!

333
00:29:21,351 --> 00:29:25,634
MARISHA: Yeah, but do we know of any other dragons
here?

334
00:29:25,634 --> 00:29:31,076
LAURA: Well, then we're going to have to fucking
go to the Slayer's Take.

335
00:29:31,076 --> 00:29:34,521
TRAVIS: Can we go somewhere in the next 60
seconds?

336
00:29:34,521 --> 00:29:35,769
LAURA: This'll be great.

337
00:29:35,769 --> 00:29:38,651
MARISHA: Let's talk to Kashaw. We go up and we
talk to Kashaw.

338
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:46,836
MATT: As you approach, you see him leaning in with
younger, early twenties-looking men. A bit

339
00:29:46,836 --> 00:29:50,462
scrawny; they're still armored; the helmet looks a
little lopsided. Kashaw's like, "You're not

340
00:29:50,462 --> 00:30:01,524
"supposed to put the shield away. (sighs) Oh,
wonderful. Take five. Take 30. So. You're alive.

341
00:30:01,524 --> 00:30:04,221
"That's great. I'm excited. What can I do for
you?"

342
00:30:04,221 --> 00:30:07,378
TALIESIN: Kashaw, how would you like to be
anywhere else other than here right now?

343
00:30:07,378 --> 00:30:10,733
MATT: "Depends on where and what you'd have me
doing."

344
00:30:10,733 --> 00:30:16,917
TALIESIN: That's exactly the sort of enthusiasm I
was hoping for. We have need of an emissary to the

345
00:30:16,917 --> 00:30:21,098
Slayer's Take. We need to convince them to help us
kill the next dragon.

346
00:30:21,098 --> 00:30:23,036
LAURA: And Vanessa really likes you.

347
00:30:23,036 --> 00:30:24,281
TALIESIN: She does.

348
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:28,235
MARISHA: We need a big beast on Draconia.

349
00:30:28,235 --> 00:30:38,465
MATT: "So you're saying that I go back to
frozen-ass Vasselheim to deliver a paper message

350
00:30:38,465 --> 00:30:45,621
"to the headmistress, whom already I am so happy to
be away from."

351
00:30:45,621 --> 00:30:47,269
MARISHA: Yeah. See?

352
00:30:47,269 --> 00:30:53,024
MATT: He glances over at the rest of the soldiers.
"Yeah, I'll take it."

353
00:30:53,024 --> 00:30:55,350
(laughter)

354
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,690
LAURA: Thank you.

355
00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:03,861
TALIESIN: We are in your debt. I'll have the paper
drawn up, and anything you can do to put the

356
00:31:03,861 --> 00:31:09,533
weight of the situation behind us and make sure
they know how clear it is and how necessary this

357
00:31:09,533 --> 00:31:11,618
is and how desperate we are.

358
00:31:11,618 --> 00:31:17,573
MATT: "I'll do my best to muster some semblance of
emphasis."

359
00:31:17,573 --> 00:31:23,742
TALIESIN: And we'll figure out ways to make sure
there's money in it for them, or at least dragon parts.

360
00:31:23,742 --> 00:31:29,319
MATT: "All right. Give me a list of what you've
got to offer. I'll bring it to them."

361
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:30,728
TALIESIN: Excellent.

362
00:31:30,728 --> 00:31:32,836
SAM: What do we got to offer?

363
00:31:32,836 --> 00:31:36,684
LIAM: We don't have the troll dick anymore. That's
gone.

364
00:31:36,684 --> 00:31:40,832
LAURA: We have 40 pounds of dragonhide. Black
dragonhide.

365
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:42,134
TALIESIN: And white dragonhide.

366
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:43,723
LAURA: We don't have white dragonhide.

367
00:31:43,723 --> 00:31:45,010
TALIESIN: We have white scales.

368
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:49,742
TRAVIS: We have 64 pounds of scales from me. We have
four claws left.

369
00:31:49,742 --> 00:31:55,874
SAM: I have a Tome of Leadership worth 30,000
gold.

370
00:31:55,874 --> 00:31:59,411
LAURA: No, that's Keyleth's, remember? In the next
century, when she's still living.

371
00:31:59,411 --> 00:32:01,546
SAM: We'll get it back before 100 years are up.

372
00:32:01,546 --> 00:32:03,689
MARISHA: I'll lend it to them for 100 years.

373
00:32:03,689 --> 00:32:05,572
SAM: A 99-year lease.

374
00:32:05,572 --> 00:32:08,148
TRAVIS: And we got umber hulk pieces, too.

375
00:32:08,148 --> 00:32:13,189
TALIESIN: Mostly, I was thinking of also offering
them whatever we can take from the dragon itself

376
00:32:13,189 --> 00:32:14,326
once it's destroyed.

377
00:32:14,326 --> 00:32:17,527
LIAM: I was about to say, yeah, we put into the
contract that it has the remains of the beast we

378
00:32:17,527 --> 00:32:19,672
take down, which we will take down.

379
00:32:19,672 --> 00:32:22,803
TALIESIN: We keep some scales, we keep some teeth;
we split it.

380
00:32:22,803 --> 00:32:24,718
LIAM: Sure, as a souvenir, right. Yes.

381
00:32:24,718 --> 00:32:26,931
MARISHA: We're basically doing a contract for
free.

382
00:32:26,931 --> 00:32:29,412
LIAM: It's a very large creature.

383
00:32:29,412 --> 00:32:34,282
SAM: That's provided we kill it. If we lose, they
get nothing. I'm just saying, from their

384
00:32:34,282 --> 00:32:38,381
perspective, we're offering them literally
nothing.

385
00:32:38,381 --> 00:32:41,684
MARISHA: If they lose, they don't lose anything
either, right?

386
00:32:41,684 --> 00:32:43,641
LAURA: No, they do. They lose a contract.

387
00:32:43,641 --> 00:32:46,951
MARISHA: But wouldn't the contract just go right
back into cycle?

388
00:32:46,951 --> 00:32:54,481
LAURA: No, if the dragon kills the creature and
then we all die and we can't harvest it, the Slayer's

389
00:32:54,481 --> 00:32:58,078
Take doesn't have anything from its previous
contract.

390
00:32:58,078 --> 00:33:01,829
LIAM: But that could happen with any contract. Any
band of idiots could go die on the battlefield.

391
00:33:01,829 --> 00:33:03,861
MARISHA: They're used to having people die.

392
00:33:03,861 --> 00:33:04,950
LAURA: Well, fuck it.

393
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,631
MARISHA: I think Grog's getting antsy.

394
00:33:06,631 --> 00:33:08,622
TALIESIN: I like this. I'm going to have it drawn
up.

395
00:33:08,622 --> 00:33:12,061
LIAM: I look at Grog and see he's really bored. I
pick up a wooden sword and I hit him as hard as I

396
00:33:12,061 --> 00:33:13,990
can on the small of his back.

397
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:15,243
TRAVIS: Yes!

398
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,656
MATT: Make a check.

399
00:33:16,656 --> 00:33:18,285
LIAM: It's not going to be that hard.

400
00:33:18,285 --> 00:33:20,483
LAURA: While all this is going on, Grog, you could
be training these soldiers.

401
00:33:20,483 --> 00:33:22,139
LIAM: 17.

402
00:33:22,139 --> 00:33:23,718
TRAVIS: What, train them?

403
00:33:23,718 --> 00:33:28,939
MATT: As you're having this conversation, (whack)
right in the knee cap, a surprisingly painful

404
00:33:28,939 --> 00:33:34,016
and forceful blow. It's less the strength behind
it and more the precision in which it strikes you

405
00:33:34,016 --> 00:33:37,310
right between the kneecap and the rest of the
lower half of your knee.

406
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,907
TRAVIS: Like when a doctor hits you and your knee
jumps?

407
00:33:38,907 --> 00:33:43,815
MATT: Yeah, and you're like (grunts) and you
glance over and you see Vax hide a wooden sword

408
00:33:43,815 --> 00:33:45,305
quickly behind him as he backs away.

409
00:33:45,305 --> 00:33:47,540
LIAM: Come on, big guy! I know you're bored! Come
on! I hit him again.

410
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:50,593
MATT: Roll a strength check. Actually, this time
it's an attack roll, as well.

411
00:33:50,593 --> 00:33:52,369
MARISHA: Hit him in the nuts.

412
00:33:52,369 --> 00:33:57,015
LIAM: Okay, cool. That's a 20. Oh! But it's with a
stick! Just strength modifier?

413
00:33:57,015 --> 00:33:58,877
MATT: You're not proficient with a sword.

414
00:33:58,877 --> 00:34:04,098
LIAM: Oh dear. I'm going to use Luck. 14.

415
00:34:04,098 --> 00:34:08,998
MATT: (laughs) You whack him. This time, it hits
the meat of his thigh and has no effect.

416
00:34:08,998 --> 00:34:11,570
LIAM: I missed the nut? Ugh. Come on!

417
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:14,456
TRAVIS: Do you have a death wish?

418
00:34:14,456 --> 00:34:18,628
LIAM: Come on, take a swing! I'm trying to do you
a favor! Come on, get it out!

419
00:34:18,628 --> 00:34:21,108
TRAVIS: What am I missing here?

420
00:34:21,108 --> 00:34:27,615
TALIESIN: I'm seeing this going down. I've walked
away.

421
00:34:27,615 --> 00:34:29,899
LIAM: I see a gauntlet on a table, and I throw it
at his face.

422
00:34:29,899 --> 00:34:33,824
MATT: Okay, roll an attack roll.

423
00:34:33,824 --> 00:34:35,208
LIAM: It's a one!

424
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:37,199
(laughter)

425
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:41,118
SAM: I see this going on, and I stand up on
something, and I yell to the students--

426
00:34:41,118 --> 00:34:47,242
MATT: Before this happens, as you're getting up,
you watch as Vax rears back, and as he throws it,

427
00:34:47,242 --> 00:34:52,179
(yelps) he pulls a muscle in his shoulder and it
drops to the ground, and you're like

428
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:53,306
(pained noises).

429
00:34:53,306 --> 00:34:54,774
LAURA: Seriously?

430
00:34:54,774 --> 00:35:01,401
SAM: I jump up on a chair and I yell to the
students: Instructor Kashaw has instructed us that

431
00:35:01,401 --> 00:35:07,468
this is a drill! You are to attack that man right
there, that large man, as a test of your strength

432
00:35:07,468 --> 00:35:09,192
and training. Now!

433
00:35:09,192 --> 00:35:10,607
LAURA: Don't kill them, Grog!

434
00:35:10,607 --> 00:35:12,116
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

435
00:35:12,116 --> 00:35:16,670
TALIESIN: Oh, this is going to be awful. Wow. That
is cruel.

436
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:20,170
SAM: 34.

437
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:24,090
(laughter)

438
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:30,650
MATT: You watch as roughly 45 armored soldiers all
turn towards you with their shields and spears...

439
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:37,471
and freeze. They all slowly look towards Scanlan
and whisper among themselves, then look back at

440
00:35:37,471 --> 00:35:45,771
Grog and stay frozen and two creep forward for a
minute. Get a little closer.

441
00:35:45,771 --> 00:35:49,533
TRAVIS: I take the Gauntlets and I smash them
together, and I grow in size.

442
00:35:49,533 --> 00:35:52,252
(laughter)

443
00:35:52,252 --> 00:36:00,246
MATT: As your form swells into your now enlarged
goliath battle-ready form, you notice a few of

444
00:36:00,246 --> 00:36:05,842
them start giving off this rattling metal sound as
their armored knees (clanging) together. Many of

445
00:36:05,842 --> 00:36:13,828
them step back about ten feet, and Kashaw, who
hasn't left entirely, spins around and goes: "The

446
00:36:13,828 --> 00:36:21,982
"gnome's fucking with you. It's fine!" He walks up
to you, Scanlan, pats your arm and goes, "That was

447
00:36:21,982 --> 00:36:23,547
"pretty funny."

448
00:36:23,547 --> 00:36:25,136
SAM: I try.

449
00:36:25,136 --> 00:36:27,994
MATT: "Don't get the people killed. I've been
working on them for four days."

450
00:36:27,994 --> 00:36:30,185
SAM: He wasn't going to kill-- Were you going to
kill them, Grog?

451
00:36:30,185 --> 00:36:31,074
TRAVIS: Yes.

452
00:36:31,074 --> 00:36:32,540
SAM: Oh shit.

453
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:40,299
TRAVIS: I look at Vax and I go, you were just
playing around, right?

454
00:36:40,299 --> 00:36:41,787
LIAM: Yes.

455
00:36:41,787 --> 00:36:44,932
TRAVIS: And in my giant state, I'm going to kick
him like a soccer ball.

456
00:36:44,932 --> 00:36:48,267
LIAM: I'm going to dodge. Uncanny Dodge, man.

457
00:36:48,267 --> 00:36:50,860
MATT: Well, we'll see. Go ahead and roll an attack
roll.

458
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:57,704
TRAVIS: That's good. 32.

459
00:36:57,704 --> 00:36:59,689
LIAM: Ooh. No, I didn't miss that.

460
00:36:59,689 --> 00:37:01,362
MATT: Roll a strength check.

461
00:37:01,362 --> 00:37:05,797
LIAM: Wait, I'm going to use another Luck and make
him roll again and pick the lower of the two.

462
00:37:05,797 --> 00:37:06,926
MATT: Okay.

463
00:37:06,926 --> 00:37:09,945
TRAVIS: 15 on the strength check. 25.

464
00:37:09,945 --> 00:37:11,486
LIAM: Got to roll again for the hit.

465
00:37:11,486 --> 00:37:15,750
MATT: Roll again because he used a Luck point to
force you to reroll your attack roll.

466
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:18,276
TRAVIS: 24.

467
00:37:18,276 --> 00:37:19,512
LIAM: That hits.

468
00:37:19,512 --> 00:37:20,786
MATT: What was the strength roll again?

469
00:37:20,786 --> 00:37:22,456
TRAVIS: The strength was 24.

470
00:37:22,456 --> 00:37:30,699
MATT: Strength check was 24. So as you peek out of
the corner of your eye you hear this (heavy steps)

471
00:37:30,699 --> 00:37:33,545
and as you try and spin and dodge out of the way
instinctually--

472
00:37:33,545 --> 00:37:34,885
LIAM: Uncanny Dodge!

473
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:43,028
MATT: I know and we'll get to that. Instinctually,
you turn to dodge out of something Grog-sized, not

474
00:37:43,028 --> 00:37:50,502
giant-sized. And in that brief minute that you
remember that he grew, you pause just long enough

475
00:37:50,502 --> 00:37:57,896
to (whack) feel the force of what feels like a
giant battering ram slam into your side, sending

476
00:37:57,896 --> 00:38:08,254
you off your feet and arcing a good 30 feet before
you (impact) tumble and skid to the ground. What's

477
00:38:08,254 --> 00:38:09,893
your strength modifier?

478
00:38:09,893 --> 00:38:11,115
TRAVIS: Seven.

479
00:38:11,115 --> 00:38:17,405
MATT: Seven. You take 14 points of bludgeoning
damage, reduced to half because you're taking

480
00:38:17,405 --> 00:38:23,534
Uncanny Dodge. So only seven points bludgeoning
damage. You stay there for a second, stunned. You

481
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:27,696
feel a bit of bile and iron taste in the back of
your throat.

482
00:38:27,696 --> 00:38:32,224
LIAM: And in the distance you hear: (strained) I
feel so alive.

483
00:38:32,224 --> 00:38:34,926
(laughter)

484
00:38:34,926 --> 00:38:36,623
TALIESIN: First rule of Fight Club.

485
00:38:36,623 --> 00:38:44,476
TRAVIS: Can I check the Titanstone Knuckles? Have
they changed now that I've kicked a friend in the face?

486
00:38:44,476 --> 00:38:49,537
MATT: (laughing) Make an investigation check.

487
00:38:49,537 --> 00:38:52,068
TRAVIS: Damn it! Eight.

488
00:38:52,068 --> 00:38:58,343
MATT: They appear to have maintained their
composure as gauntlets.

489
00:38:58,343 --> 00:39:04,244
LIAM: There's some blood and five long, dark hairs
on them.

490
00:39:04,244 --> 00:39:09,575
MATT: You watch as a lot of the soldiers who had
been watching this endeavor step even further away

491
00:39:09,575 --> 00:39:14,579
from Grog, and some of them begin walking off,
taking their helmets off. "All right, we're done."

492
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:19,132
LAURA: Hey bonus, he's on our side. Eh? That's
encouraging.

493
00:39:19,132 --> 00:39:25,482
MATT: They all nod their heads. "Yeah, I know
that. Thank god!" But they're all doing this while

494
00:39:25,482 --> 00:39:30,761
still locking eyes with him. "That's great." And
slowly walk off.

495
00:39:30,761 --> 00:39:32,466
TRAVIS: (chuckles)

496
00:39:32,466 --> 00:39:33,579
LIAM: Vex.

497
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:34,697
LAURA: Yeah?

498
00:39:34,697 --> 00:39:36,040
LIAM: Help me up.

499
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,594
LAURA: Don't you have wings?

500
00:39:37,594 --> 00:39:48,594
LIAM: Not going to use them right now. Just a
hand. (groans) That's going to bruise. Worth it.

501
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:51,430
TRAVIS: Thank you. I was getting so bored.

502
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,850
LIAM: (sighs) I know.

503
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:54,477
TRAVIS: Thanks, bubby.

504
00:39:54,477 --> 00:39:59,938
TALIESIN: What are the chances I would have at
least a basic portable writing desk? They're not

505
00:39:59,938 --> 00:40:01,479
that complicated.

506
00:40:01,479 --> 00:40:03,266
MATT: A portable writing desk?

507
00:40:03,266 --> 00:40:07,379
TALIESIN: 16th century-style. Just something to
write on.

508
00:40:07,379 --> 00:40:09,581
MARISHA: What do you need a writing desk for?

509
00:40:09,581 --> 00:40:13,439
TALIESIN: Just something with paper, pen, and
something to write on.

510
00:40:13,439 --> 00:40:16,499
MATT: You have access to a quill and ink, you have
access to parchment.

511
00:40:16,499 --> 00:40:19,179
LIAM: How about a fucking clipboard?

512
00:40:19,179 --> 00:40:22,697
TALIESIN: It's basically a fucking clipboard.

513
00:40:22,697 --> 00:40:24,698
MATT: You have access to that, yes.

514
00:40:24,698 --> 00:40:26,702
LIAM: Percival de Rolo, Inventor of Clipboard.

515
00:40:26,702 --> 00:40:29,992
TALIESIN: No, it was called a writing desk back
then. It was called a writing desk. There's a

516
00:40:29,992 --> 00:40:32,580
thing. It was that big and you put it on your lap.
It was a writing desk.

517
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:35,391
MATT: All right. Yes, you have access to that.

518
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:39,933
SAM: So wait, what is in this letter? What are we
offering them?

519
00:40:39,933 --> 00:40:41,855
MARISHA: Yeah, how's the letter going?

520
00:40:41,855 --> 00:40:44,800
TALIESIN: I'm writing the letter up. I've
basically gotten it together. I've explained the

521
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:50,489
situation briefly. I assume they're aware of the
war and the current reality.

522
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:54,769
SAM: And to clarify for me. We're asking them--

523
00:40:54,769 --> 00:41:00,374
TALIESIN: I'm getting there. In this, I'm asking
for their assistance in killing a dragon. For

524
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:08,229
this assistance, they will get all bounty of
biological remnants of the dragon, with a small

525
00:41:08,229 --> 00:41:18,938
percentage of scales and teeth kept for us. Asking
for 20 percent, but negotiable. We want them to

526
00:41:18,938 --> 00:41:24,799
supply either a local or give some intel into
where we can find a beast large enough for this

527
00:41:24,799 --> 00:41:29,930
dragon to attack. Information that we have on this
dragon so that they actually help us strategize

528
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:37,620
any ways of defeating it, and any other help that they
could give in defeating this creature. And as a

529
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:43,461
token of our goodwill, we are sending them a small
package of black and white dragon scales and a

530
00:41:43,461 --> 00:41:44,674
dragon tooth.

531
00:41:44,674 --> 00:41:48,847
LAURA: Yes. And make sure to include that this
must all be completed within 14 days.

532
00:41:48,847 --> 00:41:50,168
SAM: But wait.

533
00:41:50,168 --> 00:41:51,706
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: There's more.

534
00:41:51,706 --> 00:41:53,983
SAM: Asking them to help us kill a dragon?

535
00:41:53,983 --> 00:41:55,240
TALIESIN: For stuff.

536
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,483
SAM: No, but that's not what we're asking them.
We're asking them to find a beast.

537
00:41:58,483 --> 00:42:00,056
LAURA: Yes, that's what he said.

538
00:42:00,056 --> 00:42:01,348
TALIESIN: It's in the letter.

539
00:42:01,348 --> 00:42:04,148
LAURA: That's part of that listening thing,
Scanlan.

540
00:42:04,148 --> 00:42:05,296
SAM: I'm sorry.

541
00:42:05,296 --> 00:42:07,063
LIAM: He did talk for quite a while.

542
00:42:07,063 --> 00:42:11,856
TALIESIN: Is there a way to enchant me so that I
have his voice? And then he'll listen more closely?

543
00:42:11,856 --> 00:42:14,196
MARISHA: Yeah, actually.

544
00:42:14,196 --> 00:42:15,980
MATT: He has a spell for that.

545
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,814
(laughter)

546
00:42:17,814 --> 00:42:21,070
TALIESIN: Don't answer that.

547
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:25,974
MATT: As you finish penning the letter, you read
over it once, twice, make sure all the

548
00:42:25,974 --> 00:42:29,924
information is contained. You go ahead and grab
the little bit of your offering of dragon scales

549
00:42:29,924 --> 00:42:34,522
and teeth. Present them to Kashaw. He takes the
letter and reads it over. "Sure."

550
00:42:34,522 --> 00:42:37,484
SAM: Should we add an NDA?

551
00:42:37,484 --> 00:42:41,529
TALIESIN: There's a rider at the end of everything
I send.

552
00:42:41,529 --> 00:42:49,002
LAURA: Kashaw. No mention of Whitestone at all.
Anywhere you go. Very important.

553
00:42:49,002 --> 00:42:51,516
TRAVIS: Good addendum. Whatever that word is.

554
00:42:51,516 --> 00:42:52,766
LIAM: Again, please?

555
00:42:52,766 --> 00:42:54,792
LAURA and TALIESIN: No mention of Whitestone.

556
00:42:54,792 --> 00:42:57,088
LAURA: Do we have a way to get him there very
quickly?

557
00:42:57,088 --> 00:42:59,460
MARISHA: What? Kashaw?

558
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:07,760
MATT: "Are you going to do your tree thing for me?
Otherwise, I can walk, but it'll be a month and a

559
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,438
"half before I get to shore."

560
00:43:09,438 --> 00:43:11,525
MARISHA: Yeah. We're going to be here the rest of
the day, right?

561
00:43:11,525 --> 00:43:13,058
SAM: How will he get back?

562
00:43:13,058 --> 00:43:21,566
MARISHA: Druids. People. Wizards. Sorcerers.

563
00:43:21,566 --> 00:43:24,032
SAM: Wait! We got those rocks.

564
00:43:24,032 --> 00:43:25,536
LAURA: He's a really smart man.

565
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:27,617
TALIESIN: Oh, the rock. That's a really good
idea.

566
00:43:27,617 --> 00:43:29,317
LAURA: Yeah, but then he'll pop where we are.

567
00:43:29,317 --> 00:43:30,526
TALIESIN: No, we'll leave the rock here.

568
00:43:30,526 --> 00:43:32,115
SAM: We're going to stay here at least a day.

569
00:43:32,115 --> 00:43:33,746
LIAM: Well, you've got friends, don't you?

570
00:43:33,746 --> 00:43:34,914
MATT: "I'm can figure something out."

571
00:43:34,914 --> 00:43:36,165
LAURA: Don't worry about it.

572
00:43:36,165 --> 00:43:37,852
SAM: Steal an airship on your way back.

573
00:43:37,852 --> 00:43:39,644
MATT: (chuckles) "No."

574
00:43:39,644 --> 00:43:42,404
MARISHA: All right. Let's go to the Sun Tree.

575
00:43:42,404 --> 00:43:47,689
MATT: "All right." Gets his shield and his spear
and walks down with Keyleth towards the Sun Tree.

576
00:43:47,689 --> 00:43:49,905
As he's walking down, at your side.

577
00:43:49,905 --> 00:43:51,458
LAURA: Don't you want to walk with them?

578
00:43:51,458 --> 00:43:54,478
LIAM: No. Where is that coming from?

579
00:43:54,478 --> 00:43:59,642
SAM: No, he definitely has a thing for you, Vax. I
have a keen eye for these things.

580
00:43:59,642 --> 00:44:06,629
LIAM: But you can't address it. You just have to
let it be. I'm not going to encourage it. I'm not

581
00:44:06,629 --> 00:44:07,858
interested in him.

582
00:44:07,858 --> 00:44:09,974
TALIESIN: I see it every time. He does. He
smolders.

583
00:44:09,974 --> 00:44:14,516
MATT: As he walks with you down the pathway,
having this conversation. It's that awkward, quiet

584
00:44:14,516 --> 00:44:27,063
about three, four minutes of walking before he
goes. (sniffs) "Ugh. So when all this is over--"

585
00:44:27,063 --> 00:44:34,216
MARISHA: Oh, come on, man. Why are you doing this
to me?

586
00:44:34,216 --> 00:44:36,364
(laughter)

587
00:44:36,364 --> 00:44:38,978
TRAVIS: Hold on, it's going to happen. Let it
happen.

588
00:44:38,978 --> 00:44:44,468
MATT: "If we survive all this dragon business--"

589
00:44:44,468 --> 00:44:51,081
MARISHA: Fuck you, I hate you so much right now.
(laughs) Uh-huh?

590
00:44:51,081 --> 00:44:53,473
MATT: "Do you want to get a drink?"

591
00:44:53,473 --> 00:44:58,727
MARISHA: I love drinks.

592
00:44:58,727 --> 00:45:00,420
MATT: "Good."

593
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:01,783
MARISHA: So much.

594
00:45:01,783 --> 00:45:03,337
MATT: "Great."

595
00:45:03,337 --> 00:45:07,173
MARISHA: What kind of a drink?

596
00:45:07,173 --> 00:45:14,678
MATT: You guys begin to approach the edge of the
tree. He goes: "I think you answered your own question."

597
00:45:14,678 --> 00:45:21,116
MARISHA: Yeah.

598
00:45:21,116 --> 00:45:22,868
MATT: "Is that a yes?"

599
00:45:22,868 --> 00:45:24,136
MARISHA: Well...

600
00:45:24,136 --> 00:45:26,901
MATT: "Open the damn tree."

601
00:45:26,901 --> 00:45:43,151
MARISHA: Look. You know. It's really complicated
right now, and I'm trying this whole

602
00:45:43,151 --> 00:45:46,432
"allowing myself to feel things" thing.

603
00:45:46,432 --> 00:45:49,925
MATT: "Yeah. It doesn't work out for anybody.
Trust me."

604
00:45:49,925 --> 00:45:55,739
MARISHA: Oh man. I don't know how to respond to
that.

605
00:45:55,739 --> 00:46:11,289
I'll see you on the other side. We'll put a pin on
this one. Bye, Kash. And I cast it through the

606
00:46:11,289 --> 00:46:13,511
tree and I push him in.

607
00:46:13,511 --> 00:46:20,454
MATT: "All right, then. We'll just-- hey!" And you
push him through the tree. Shuts behind him.

608
00:46:20,454 --> 00:46:27,304
You're left there alone, standing in the cold
Whitestone air outside of the Sun Tree. Around

609
00:46:27,304 --> 00:46:28,641
mid-morning.

610
00:46:28,641 --> 00:46:33,816
SAM: Did Kash leave already?

611
00:46:33,816 --> 00:46:35,530
MARISHA: Yeah, he's gone.

612
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:42,455
SAM: Aw, Vax, you didn't get a chance to say
anything to him. I've talked to him about this. He

613
00:46:42,455 --> 00:46:44,247
has his eyes out on you.

614
00:46:44,247 --> 00:46:48,313
LIAM: I've got enough complications around me as
it is.

615
00:46:48,313 --> 00:46:52,146
SAM: I'm a really good reader of people.

616
00:46:52,146 --> 00:46:56,950
LIAM: It's true.

617
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:58,848
SAM: The dark eyeliner--

618
00:46:58,848 --> 00:47:05,206
LAURA: So now that that's handled, are we leaving
today?

619
00:47:05,206 --> 00:47:07,139
TALIESIN: Oh, we're leaving today.

620
00:47:07,139 --> 00:47:10,811
SAM: Well, one of us doesn't have any luck left,
so maybe we should spend the night.

621
00:47:10,811 --> 00:47:13,451
LIAM: I've got a little bit of luck. I'm a lucky
guy.

622
00:47:13,451 --> 00:47:15,069
TALIESIN: We'll get our luck back tomorrow.

623
00:47:15,069 --> 00:47:16,899
LAURA: We've got a limited amount of time on
this.

624
00:47:16,899 --> 00:47:24,400
MATT: All right. You guys make your way towards
the building that has recently been essentially

625
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:30,202
given to and is acting as the abode for Shaun
Gilmore while he's here in Whitestone. As you come

626
00:47:30,202 --> 00:47:37,506
to the front door, the door's closed. You knock.
(knocking) No response.

627
00:47:37,506 --> 00:47:43,722
LIAM: Shaun? Shaun! It's us. Are you home?

628
00:47:43,722 --> 00:47:52,670
MATT: You hear a muffled voice in the distance
within the building go, "Yeah, hold on."

629
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:56,470
LAURA: Did it sound like anyone we knew?

630
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:59,535
MATT: It sounded like Gilmore. He's under some
sort of duress.

631
00:47:59,535 --> 00:48:02,147
MARISHA: Sounded like he was under duress?

632
00:48:02,147 --> 00:48:03,498
MATT: Slightly.

633
00:48:03,498 --> 00:48:05,205
LAURA: Is everything okay?

634
00:48:05,205 --> 00:48:13,279
MATT: "Yes. Hold on, please." And you watch as the
barrier flickers for a second and restores itself,

635
00:48:13,279 --> 00:48:19,538
almost like a wave of energy brought what was a
slowly dwindling bit of the blue energy, now

636
00:48:19,538 --> 00:48:21,539
restored to its full strength.

637
00:48:21,539 --> 00:48:24,109
TRAVIS: He's got to use the privy at some point.

638
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:26,295
SAM: Yeah, he's probably squeezing one out. It's
okay.

639
00:48:26,295 --> 00:48:31,226
MATT: A moment passes before the door opens again
and you see Gilmore there, beads of sweat down the

640
00:48:31,226 --> 00:48:41,718
front of his face. He's got his fuzzy purple-blue
robe wrapped around him. "My sincerest apologies,

641
00:48:41,718 --> 00:48:44,885
"I had to take care of the now morning ritual."

642
00:48:44,885 --> 00:48:47,668
LAURA: How are you holding up, Gilmore?

643
00:48:47,668 --> 00:48:52,770
MATT: "I'm fine. This is child's play compared to
what you're having to deal with on a daily basis,

644
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:54,389
"I'm sure."

645
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:56,288
MARISHA: Can I do an insight check?

646
00:48:56,288 --> 00:48:59,857
MATT: Go for it.

647
00:48:59,857 --> 00:49:04,239
MARISHA: 15.

648
00:49:04,239 --> 00:49:05,695
MATT: 15.

649
00:49:05,695 --> 00:49:08,658
LAURA: Oh! You got a whisper on a 15.

650
00:49:08,658 --> 00:49:16,386
SAM: This is an early whisper. A first-hour
whisper is rare.

651
00:49:16,386 --> 00:49:20,366
TALIESIN: It came at such a high speed. I wish it
came so quickly.

652
00:49:20,366 --> 00:49:24,153
LIAM: I wish I knew more about Loot Crate right
now.

653
00:49:24,153 --> 00:49:30,489
SAM: Well, it's not just Loot Crate, Liam. It's
Loot Wear. Those come in a separate bag.

654
00:49:30,489 --> 00:49:32,196
LIAM: Different than Loot Crate?

655
00:49:32,196 --> 00:49:35,684
SAM: Yeah, it's different. You can find out all
about it at lootcrate.com/criticalrole.

656
00:49:35,684 --> 00:49:39,641
LAURA: Actually, the shirt you're wearing, Sam, is
from Loot Wear.

657
00:49:39,641 --> 00:49:43,417
SAM: What? It is? Oh my god! And I'm so handsome.

658
00:49:43,417 --> 00:49:45,430
TALIESIN: Anyway, back to the game.

659
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:50,265
MATT: "What can I do for you?"

660
00:49:50,265 --> 00:49:55,169
LAURA: Well, we plan to go to Marquet.

661
00:49:55,169 --> 00:50:02,023
Things have progressed much quicker than we
expected it to, and unfortunately we are on a

662
00:50:02,023 --> 00:50:05,942
two-week time crunch before all hell breaks
loose.

663
00:50:05,942 --> 00:50:14,420
MATT: "Well, at the very least, that gives us a
series of days to make the best of the time we

664
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:21,694
"have. So Marquet it is. All right. Come in." He
closes his robe a little bit and walks in, and you

665
00:50:21,694 --> 00:50:27,460
enter. You can see there's a half-drunken tea set,
and he begins to walk past. "Tea, anyone?"

666
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:31,125
SAM: I'd like a loose-leaf oolong, please.

667
00:50:31,125 --> 00:50:33,068
MATT: "I'll do what I can."

668
00:50:33,068 --> 00:50:37,931
TALIESIN: How many cups are currently sitting with
the teapot?

669
00:50:37,931 --> 00:50:43,073
MATT: Currently, there is one cup, but as he walks
by, he does this with his fingers and you watch as

670
00:50:43,073 --> 00:50:48,121
multiple cups drift off the shelf and find their
way (cups landing) on the table.

671
00:50:48,121 --> 00:50:53,227
LAURA: How does his house look? Does it look
together like it would normally be, or does it

672
00:50:53,227 --> 00:50:54,570
look disheveled at all?

673
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:58,077
MATT: It looks a little disheveled, but also it
hasn't been too long since the assassination

674
00:50:58,077 --> 00:51:03,330
attempt on him and he threw his attacker into the
far wall, but it looks like the furniture has been

675
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:07,274
placed up. There are still some bits and pieces of
broken things here and there, but for the most

676
00:51:07,274 --> 00:51:11,543
part it doesn't look like he's had lot of time to
clean up other than just making it functional. It

677
00:51:11,543 --> 00:51:16,203
seems livable; it's not too bad.

678
00:51:16,203 --> 00:51:24,746
He goes into the kitchen. He comes back out a
moment later with a fresh pot of hot tea and sets it

679
00:51:24,746 --> 00:51:32,924
down. "All right. So this isn't going to send you
to where you're going--"

680
00:51:32,924 --> 00:51:36,318
SAM: We literally know nothing about Marquet.

681
00:51:36,318 --> 00:51:40,737
MATT: "It's hot. It's dry. Bring some water if you
can."

682
00:51:40,737 --> 00:51:42,776
LIAM: You're not able to leave, are you?

683
00:51:42,776 --> 00:51:46,602
MATT: "I should not. Got to keep this going until
Allura comes back."

684
00:51:46,602 --> 00:51:57,515
SAM: Is there anyone that we can say maybe vouches
for us or someone who we are against so that we

685
00:51:57,515 --> 00:52:03,243
can win favor with the locals? Something like a
no-tail, long-tail binary.

686
00:52:03,243 --> 00:52:07,979
LIAM: We walked into a sort of political snafu
because we didn't know the lay of the land, so is

687
00:52:07,979 --> 00:52:09,826
there anything we should know in advance?

688
00:52:09,826 --> 00:52:16,781
MATT: "Best I can tell you, because I haven't been
there since I was very young, one: this going to

689
00:52:16,781 --> 00:52:23,697
"send you not to Ank'Harel itself, it's going to
send you to Shandal, which is a small oasis

690
00:52:23,697 --> 00:52:27,506
"village a little ways south of Ank'Harel. It's
where I grew up."

691
00:52:27,506 --> 00:52:29,055
LIAM: What was that name again?

692
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:30,222
MATT: "Shandal."

693
00:52:30,222 --> 00:52:31,729
LIAM: Shandal.

694
00:52:31,729 --> 00:52:40,411
MATT: "I will say that it has been about 15 years,
so I don't quite know what to expect there. I

695
00:52:40,411 --> 00:52:44,962
"apologize in advance for any ensuing chaos, but
it's a nice town. It's small, it's sleepy. It's

696
00:52:44,962 --> 00:52:58,912
"not my speed. Hence why I came here. However, in
Marquet, it's mostly music, culture, fun people,

697
00:52:58,912 --> 00:53:07,660
"good food. Don't break the laws. Don't drink the
water freely from the various channels you may

698
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:13,934
"stumble across. Water there is a commodity. It is
controlled and sold throughout the city."

699
00:53:13,934 --> 00:53:17,282
LIAM: We got a jug.

700
00:53:17,282 --> 00:53:18,992
TRAVIS: We got loads.

701
00:53:18,992 --> 00:53:25,399
MATT: "Those are the main things I can think of. I
don't know what else you're really looking for there."

702
00:53:25,399 --> 00:53:29,901
SAM: Well, I can tell you.

703
00:53:29,901 --> 00:53:31,468
TALIESIN: Cabal's Ruin.

704
00:53:31,468 --> 00:53:32,811
SAM: Thank you.

705
00:53:32,811 --> 00:53:34,330
TALIESIN and MARISHA: The Den of Druja.

706
00:53:34,330 --> 00:53:36,043
MARISHA: Druyah. Drujah?

707
00:53:36,043 --> 00:53:37,380
TALIESIN: Druhah.

708
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,929
MARISHA: Jaja.

709
00:53:39,929 --> 00:53:42,132
TALIESIN: Thanks.

710
00:53:42,132 --> 00:53:49,443
MATT: "I don't know anything about that,
unfortunately, but most folks that have

711
00:53:49,443 --> 00:53:53,351
"information are eager to give what they know with
a little coin to grease the palm."

712
00:53:53,351 --> 00:53:55,100
TALIESIN: Or a little water.

713
00:53:55,100 --> 00:54:01,497
MATT: "Depends on who you're talking to. Anything
else?"

714
00:54:01,497 --> 00:54:04,387
LIAM: No, go ahead.

715
00:54:04,387 --> 00:54:09,402
MATT: He pours tea for everyone else who asked for
it. And for each person that asked for a different

716
00:54:09,402 --> 00:54:13,272
flavor of tea, he begins to snap his fingers and
the tea color changes.

717
00:54:13,272 --> 00:54:22,044
LAURA: We are looking for a merchant warrior.
Outside of you, do you know of any very powerful merchants?

718
00:54:22,044 --> 00:54:23,799
MATT: "There are many."

719
00:54:23,799 --> 00:54:26,594
LAURA: One with a missing eye?

720
00:54:26,594 --> 00:54:32,659
MATT: "That would definitely probably narrow it
down, but none that I can remember off the top of my head."

721
00:54:32,659 --> 00:54:35,756
SAM: Why don't we bring Jarett with us? Is that a
thing?

722
00:54:35,756 --> 00:54:38,671
LAURA: We should talk to him.

723
00:54:38,671 --> 00:54:45,024
SAM: Okay. Shaun, you do so much for us. We do
nothing for you. Is there anything we can bring

724
00:54:45,024 --> 00:54:47,840
back for you or messages to give to someone
there?

725
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:50,852
LIAM: Is there anyone you haven't seen in all
these years?

726
00:54:50,852 --> 00:54:58,086
MATT: "When you meet them, and you'll know who
they are, tell them I say hello. And actually--"

727
00:54:58,086 --> 00:55:07,290
He thinks to himself for a second. Rushes off.
Comes back with a small backpack made of leather

728
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:15,231
and thick, light tan wool. He opens it up and
reaches inside. Pulls out a small silver locket

729
00:55:15,231 --> 00:55:23,456
and takes it and puts it in your hand, Vex. He
goes, "Just give that to them."

730
00:55:23,456 --> 00:55:24,744
LAURA: To them?

731
00:55:24,744 --> 00:55:29,295
MATT: He closes the bag and places it back in the
other room.

732
00:55:29,295 --> 00:55:36,821
MARISHA: Shaun, are you doing okay? You look a
little worn out.

733
00:55:36,821 --> 00:55:41,308
MATT: (sighs) "We do what we must."

734
00:55:41,308 --> 00:55:51,380
MARISHA: I could only imagine a barrier of this
size of a construct can be quite taxing on one's

735
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:53,296
physical energy.

736
00:55:53,296 --> 00:56:02,253
MATT: "Yes. I guess if I had one request of all of
you, this goes universally, can we end this dragon

737
00:56:02,253 --> 00:56:09,080
"business soon? Please? I really just want to set
up shop again."

738
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:12,387
LIAM: We would like nothing more. I think we're on
the same page.

739
00:56:12,387 --> 00:56:15,055
MATT: "Great."

740
00:56:15,055 --> 00:56:19,577
LAURA: We're very interested to start paying you
for your service again, Gilmore, and stop

741
00:56:19,577 --> 00:56:21,742
expecting it for free.

742
00:56:21,742 --> 00:56:27,055
MATT: "Good. Because I've been keeping a tally. I
don't know about you guys, but the tab is running

743
00:56:27,055 --> 00:56:28,196
"very deep."

744
00:56:28,196 --> 00:56:32,880
LAURA: Oh, believe me. I have, as well. This
locket will take a nice little chunk off of that tally.

745
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,589
MATT: "Fantastic. I love it."

746
00:56:34,589 --> 00:56:36,435
LIAM: Birds of a feather, you two.

747
00:56:36,435 --> 00:56:40,714
SAM: Should we go talk to Jarett and then come
back?

748
00:56:40,714 --> 00:56:46,067
TALIESIN: Let's go talk to Jarett. We'll have
appropriate clothing set up and prepare ourselves

749
00:56:46,067 --> 00:56:47,800
for the trip.

750
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,564
SAM: Robes and things?

751
00:56:49,564 --> 00:56:51,296
MATT: "I'll be here if you need me."

752
00:56:51,296 --> 00:56:52,798
LAURA: Thank you.

753
00:56:52,798 --> 00:56:54,286
SAM: We'll be back in an hour.

754
00:56:54,286 --> 00:56:57,838
MATT: "All right. You don't want the rest of your
tea?"

755
00:56:57,838 --> 00:56:59,465
SAM: Oh. I'll drink it.

756
00:56:59,465 --> 00:57:02,908
LAURA: Do you have any to-go cups? (laughs) Just
kidding.

757
00:57:02,908 --> 00:57:05,685
MATT: "These didn't belong to me, so please, take
them if you want."

758
00:57:05,685 --> 00:57:08,258
(laughter)

759
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:12,200
MATT: He transitions the tea over into a couple of
cups and hands them off to you guys who haven't

760
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:19,407
finished. You head out. As you're leaving, you see
Sherri coming up. Her hair's a bit tattered. She's

761
00:57:19,407 --> 00:57:24,604
usually more put together when she runs the shop.
Now she's in casual Sherri mode. Her hair is

762
00:57:24,604 --> 00:57:27,817
frazzled and pulled back. Her glasses are pushed
to the end of her nose, and she's carrying a

763
00:57:27,817 --> 00:57:38,057
bundle of groceries, various bits of produce and
such. "Oh, hello, everyone. I'm bringing Gilmore

764
00:57:38,057 --> 00:57:39,598
"his breakfast."

765
00:57:39,598 --> 00:57:43,630
LIAM: Sherri. We asked him, but he's modest. How's
he doing?

766
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:55,852
MATT: "Not that he'd tell me anything, but he
doesn't have a very lengthy period of keeping this

767
00:57:55,852 --> 00:58:02,615
"up without him probably collapsing like he did
back in the city. Just please, try to do your best to

768
00:58:02,615 --> 00:58:09,702
"get this over with. I'm worried. At the very
least, until Allura comes back. At least they can

769
00:58:09,702 --> 00:58:22,341
"share the load. All right." She knocks on the door
and opens it. "Gilmore? Gilmore, breakfast." The

770
00:58:22,341 --> 00:58:24,337
door closes behind her.

771
00:58:24,337 --> 00:58:26,475
TRAVIS: Hey, I have an idea.

772
00:58:26,475 --> 00:58:27,870
SAM: Oh boy.

773
00:58:27,870 --> 00:58:36,986
TRAVIS: I know, it's thrilling. We need
eight gallon wine skins or bottles or jugs.

774
00:58:36,986 --> 00:58:42,936
Because the Alchemy Jug can make out eight gallons
of fresh water. We pour it all out and then at the

775
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:46,868
end of the day it starts over, so we have eight
gallons sitting in the bag.

776
00:58:46,868 --> 00:58:50,105
TALIESIN: In theory, we all have water skins,
don't we?

777
00:58:50,105 --> 00:58:52,261
MARISHA: We should have a spread of our survival
kits.

778
00:58:52,261 --> 00:58:56,505
LIAM: But all the same, that is a very good idea,
Grog.

779
00:58:56,505 --> 00:58:59,294
LAURA: I'm surprised you even know how many eight
gallons is, Grog.

780
00:58:59,294 --> 00:59:00,949
TRAVIS: Yeah, eight gallons.

781
00:59:00,949 --> 00:59:07,094
SAM: But if we had an extra skin or something, we
could trade it. We could give it away, so we

782
00:59:07,094 --> 00:59:08,654
should go get one, yeah?

783
00:59:08,654 --> 00:59:10,864
TRAVIS: Yeah, we could give it away, give it away,
give it away now.

784
00:59:10,864 --> 00:59:14,712
LAURA: Wow. I walk off and look for Jarett.

785
00:59:14,712 --> 00:59:16,781
LIAM: A rift just opened in the universe.

786
00:59:16,781 --> 00:59:26,194
MATT: It doesn't take you long. He is still
stationed as one of the central figures guarding

787
00:59:26,194 --> 00:59:31,479
the actual castle of Whitestone itself. Similar to
the place you saw him last time you guys had a

788
00:59:31,479 --> 00:59:35,687
conversation walking up to the castle. He stands
there with his crossbow at the ready, giving a

789
00:59:35,687 --> 00:59:41,609
long view over the surrounding valley before he
watches you approach. "Friends, you have returned.

790
00:59:41,609 --> 00:59:45,385
"I hope all is well on your end. Can I be of
service?"

791
00:59:45,385 --> 00:59:53,698
LAURA: You can tell us all about where you're
from, actually. Did you leave Marquet a long time ago?

792
00:59:53,698 --> 00:59:58,293
MATT: "It was maybe ten, nine years ago,

793
00:59:58,293 --> 01:00:09,993
"and it was not under the best terms. Probably would be
in jail had I not got away."

794
01:00:09,993 --> 01:00:11,300
LAURA: Oh, really?

795
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:19,730
MATT: "They are not very forgiving of broken laws
there, and based on certain judgments... let's

796
01:00:19,792 --> 01:00:22,872
"just say a slap on the wrist usually takes the
wrist with it."

797
01:00:22,872 --> 01:00:24,983
LAURA: What did you do?

798
01:00:24,983 --> 01:00:27,767
MATT: (sighs) "Whatever was needed for survival."

799
01:00:27,767 --> 01:00:35,303
LIAM: Well, we're going there, so I'm hoping
either you can give us a lot of tips so we don't

800
01:00:35,303 --> 01:00:42,192
run into problems, or I don't know if anyone can take
your place right now. Do you want to go on a field trip?

801
01:00:42,192 --> 01:00:43,526
MATT: "To Ank'Harel?"

802
01:00:43,526 --> 01:00:44,645
LIAM: Yeah.

803
01:00:44,645 --> 01:00:45,759
MATT: "No!"

804
01:00:45,759 --> 01:00:46,949
(laughter)

805
01:00:46,949 --> 01:00:51,196
MATT: "I'm sorry, I respect this. I think my
strength and skill set is much better used here

806
01:00:51,196 --> 01:00:58,379
"than in the Scarlet Prison beneath the Cerulean
Palace. I do not want to even conjecture spending

807
01:00:58,379 --> 01:01:02,032
"the rest of my life there, or in pieces. Also
possible."

808
01:01:02,032 --> 01:01:06,128
LIAM: Forget it. We need all the knowledge in your
head, in ours.

809
01:01:06,128 --> 01:01:10,384
MARISHA: Yeah, what was that Scarlet Prison you just
mentioned, under the what now?

810
01:01:10,384 --> 01:01:18,741
MATT: "The Cerulean Palace. The Cerulean Palace is
where the Hand of Ord generally keeps most

811
01:01:18,741 --> 01:01:26,709
"justice, where most of the courts are kept. It is
also where the Tower of J'mon Sa Ord is maintained

812
01:01:26,709 --> 01:01:34,508
"for watching over the entire city, and most of
that eastern side of Marquet. The Scarlet Prison

813
01:01:34,508 --> 01:01:42,479
"is where people go to disappear. It is also
referred to as the Scarlet Oubliette. People are

814
01:01:42,479 --> 01:01:47,834
"placed there to go away; people are placed there
to be tortured; people are placed there, rumors

815
01:01:47,834 --> 01:02:00,281
"say, to be part of various experiments.
Regardless, I would highly recommend--" He looks

816
01:02:00,281 --> 01:02:06,752
to you. "Don't steal anything unless you are damn
sure nobody knows of it."

817
01:02:06,752 --> 01:02:08,779
LIAM: I haven't stolen anything in years.

818
01:02:08,779 --> 01:02:10,906
TRAVIS: (coughing) Bullshit.

819
01:02:10,906 --> 01:02:13,889
LAURA: Me neither. (laughs nervously)

820
01:02:13,889 --> 01:02:15,708
MARISHA: I've never stolen anything!

821
01:02:15,708 --> 01:02:20,443
LAURA: Have you heard about the Den of Drujah.
Drujah.

822
01:02:20,443 --> 01:02:27,699
MATT: He closes his eyes a second. "That was... a
very, very--"

823
01:02:27,699 --> 01:02:29,616
LAURA: It's unscrupulous.

824
01:02:29,616 --> 01:02:32,750
TALIESIN: It would have been in a tale of a
one-eyed merchant.

825
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:41,390
MATT: "Not any merchant I know, but this Den you
speak of, they were a rather serious gang running

826
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:47,497
"rather violent activities in the city maybe 70, 80
years ago."

827
01:02:47,497 --> 01:02:51,102
TALIESIN: Would they have been in the walls? Is it
possible to be in the walls of Ank'Harel?

828
01:02:51,102 --> 01:02:56,795
MATT: "In the outer walls? The outer walls are
solid. They are thick; they are meant for defense

829
01:02:56,795 --> 01:03:03,898
"only. I did not run with them. I do not know
anything. It was before my time, but they have not

01:03:03,898 --> 01:03:06,238
"been around for at the very least 50 years."

831
01:03:06,238 --> 01:03:08,683
LAURA: All right.

832
01:03:08,683 --> 01:03:13,272
SAM: Do you know who rules Ank'Harel now?

833
01:03:13,272 --> 01:03:15,096
MATT: "It is J'mon Sa Ord."

834
01:03:15,096 --> 01:03:18,619
LIAM: What can you tell us about him? Or her, or
it?

835
01:03:18,619 --> 01:03:30,309
MATT: "J'mon? I have not seen J'mon, though I have
heard the stories. J'mon brought the city together

836
01:03:30,309 --> 01:03:42,059
"400 years before. When it began to grow, expand,
when it became this great oasis, long ago, it went

837
01:03:42,059 --> 01:03:50,821
"into chaos, and there were many who wished to
utilize those who lived within the center desert

838
01:03:50,821 --> 01:03:58,854
"to be abused, to be swindled, to be enslaved.

839
01:03:58,854 --> 01:04:06,983
"J'mon started the Hand of Ord, which was the
peacekeepers, and really brought the town of

840
01:04:06,983 --> 01:04:15,880
"Ank'Harel into the grand city it is today. Not
known to appear in public very often; there are many

841
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:22,567
"rumors that circulate. Some say that perhaps J'mon
is some godling, an entity that has existed long

842
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:25,140
"before Ank'Harel and will exist long after.

843
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:33,057
"There is also-- and this is my personal belief--
I think J'mon Sa Ord is many people. I think J'mon

844
01:04:33,057 --> 01:04:40,716
"is more of an office, a station, a title that's
passed on from person to person, because I've

845
01:04:40,716 --> 01:04:42,833
"heard referenced as a girl, I've heard referenced
as a boy."

846
01:04:42,833 --> 01:04:44,983
LAURA: It's like the Man in Black.

847
01:04:44,983 --> 01:04:47,443
LIAM: What story is that?

848
01:04:47,443 --> 01:04:50,812
LAURA: It's this famous tale of the Princess
Bride. Don't worry about it.

849
01:04:50,812 --> 01:04:55,771
SAM: Does the Hand of Ord carry any symbol? Do you
know of any way of identifying them?

850
01:04:55,771 --> 01:05:00,269
MATT: "They carry ornate armor of a deep blue
sapphire color, and brass."

851
01:05:00,269 --> 01:05:02,785
LIAM: Brass.

852
01:05:02,785 --> 01:05:05,024
LAURA: Like the dragon.

853
01:05:05,024 --> 01:05:11,966
SAM: And this other city, Shumble. Humbal.

854
01:05:11,966 --> 01:05:16,516
LAURA and MARISHA: Shandal.

855
01:05:16,516 --> 01:05:20,523
MATT: "Shandal! Yes. (laughs) It's more of a
podunk."

856
01:05:20,523 --> 01:05:23,922
LAURA: A very small town.

857
01:05:23,922 --> 01:05:30,269
MATT: "Comparatively, yes. Ank'Harel is immense.
Shandal is usually a small stop in case camels or

858
01:05:30,269 --> 01:05:35,707
"other horses have died in transit, as well as a
small water stop on the way to the city."

859
01:05:35,707 --> 01:05:37,824
LAURA: Is it a long trek from there to the city?

860
01:05:37,824 --> 01:05:42,435
MATT: "I'd say maybe a day's travel."

861
01:05:42,435 --> 01:05:44,178
SAM: In which direction?

862
01:05:44,178 --> 01:05:47,525
MATT: "It is to the south-southwest of Ank'Harel."

863
01:05:47,525 --> 01:05:50,715
LIAM: On par with Emon, the city? Bigger?
Smaller?

864
01:05:50,715 --> 01:05:54,525
MATT: "Oh, Emon? Comparable. A bit bigger."

865
01:05:54,525 --> 01:05:57,115
LAURA: Wow. Shit.

866
01:05:57,115 --> 01:06:00,413
TALIESIN: We'll make waves.

867
01:06:00,413 --> 01:06:03,274
MARISHA: Yeah. Maybe we shouldn't.

868
01:06:03,274 --> 01:06:06,924
TALIESIN: Well. We're going to have to get
someone's attention.

869
01:06:06,924 --> 01:06:09,262
MARISHA: It's a city that has no water. We
shouldn't make waves.

870
01:06:09,262 --> 01:06:14,182
LAURA: Do you remember, in all your time there,
did you ever deal with-- this is completely

871
01:06:14,182 --> 01:06:17,378
ridiculous-- a merchant who only had one eye?

872
01:06:17,378 --> 01:06:27,451
MATT: "I don't recall. I've met people missing
many limbs and parts of their body. Kind of

873
01:06:27,451 --> 01:06:33,258
"happens; it' a dangerous place, the deserts in
Marquet. But there are also many people that live there."

874
01:06:33,258 --> 01:06:38,178
LIAM: And you're sure we can't talk you into
going? Percy's giving out titles.

875
01:06:38,178 --> 01:06:41,031
TALIESIN: I am absolutely not!

876
01:06:41,031 --> 01:06:49,234
MATT: "I have no interest in titles. I just wish
to stay alive. I'm sorry. I am much more of use to

877
01:06:49,234 --> 01:06:54,327
"you here, I assure you. I would be a perpetually
nervous paranoid wreck if I were to come with you."

878
01:06:54,327 --> 01:06:56,430
LAURA: I can't even imagine you like that.

879
01:06:56,430 --> 01:06:58,888
MATT: "Good. We'll keep it that way."

880
01:06:58,888 --> 01:07:03,654
MARISHA: Jarett, was there still a control of
water going on while you were there?

881
01:07:03,654 --> 01:07:08,013
MATT: "Yes, for many long years, yes. The oasis is
built around."

882
01:07:08,013 --> 01:07:09,979
MARISHA: Is there anything we should know about
that?

883
01:07:09,979 --> 01:07:18,213
MATT: "Well, most of it's controlled in the River
District. A number of canals begin in the River

884
01:07:18,213 --> 01:07:24,361
"District. This is where there is the spring, the
perpetual oasis that fuels the city, and many of

885
01:07:24,361 --> 01:07:27,220
"the caravans that travel to and from."

886
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:30,474
TRAVIS: Perpetual oasis.

887
01:07:30,474 --> 01:07:31,684
MATT: "Yes."

888
01:07:31,684 --> 01:07:33,365
TRAVIS: Source of power.

889
01:07:33,365 --> 01:07:36,342
(laughter)

890
01:07:36,342 --> 01:07:42,199
SAM: Good note-taking, Grog. How do people greet
each other there in Ank'Harel? Is there a "Kord's

891
01:07:42,199 --> 01:07:44,298
"strength be with you" thing?

892
01:07:44,298 --> 01:07:51,505
MATT: "There is 'be pleased,' with a small bow,
preferably with the hand down towards the stomach,

893
01:07:51,505 --> 01:07:53,818
"with the hand out. Be pleased."

894
01:07:53,818 --> 01:07:55,493
LAURA: Be pleased.

895
01:07:55,493 --> 01:07:56,968
TRAVIS: Beep-bleep.

896
01:07:56,968 --> 01:08:01,233
LIAM: Bleep-bleep, yes. No stealing. Got it.

897
01:08:01,233 --> 01:08:02,905
SAM: Water is valuable.

898
01:08:02,905 --> 01:08:04,528
LAURA: Don't drink the water.

899
01:08:04,528 --> 01:08:07,743
LIAM: Is there anything that's offensive? We don't
want to offend anyone by accident.

900
01:08:07,743 --> 01:08:12,188
MATT: "To be honest, anything you do will offend
somebody in the right place, right time, but

901
01:08:12,188 --> 01:08:17,529
"people are pretty laid back in Ank'Harel, as long
as you follow the rules. It's a beautiful city.

902
01:08:17,529 --> 01:08:22,709
"I'm actually excited for you to see it. I'm very
proud of it, had I not made some mistakes."

903
01:08:22,709 --> 01:08:25,085
LIAM: Can we bring you anything back?

904
01:08:25,085 --> 01:08:38,032
MATT: "You know what? If you can, there is a
special spice that is harvested not far from the

905
01:08:38,032 --> 01:08:47,413
"city. If you could find me some fusaka spice? Bring
me a small-- not a lot, just a bit."

906
01:08:47,413 --> 01:08:50,063
TRAVIS: Is it for food?

907
01:08:50,063 --> 01:08:51,917
MATT: "It's for food, yes."

908
01:08:51,917 --> 01:08:54,229
LIAM: I would love to do that. We'll keep an eye
out.

909
01:08:54,229 --> 01:08:56,632
MATT: "It's a bit pricey. I can give you some--"

910
01:08:56,632 --> 01:08:57,656
ALL: No!

911
01:08:57,656 --> 01:09:00,604
LIAM: No, you've done way too much for us.

912
01:09:00,604 --> 01:09:02,275
TALIESIN and LIAM: Fair trade.

913
01:09:02,275 --> 01:09:05,672
MATT: "All right. Well, I appreciate it."

914
01:09:05,672 --> 01:09:09,704
LAURA: Be pleased.

915
01:09:09,704 --> 01:09:11,726
MATT: (laughs)

916
01:09:11,726 --> 01:09:14,631
LAURA: We'll work on it.

917
01:09:14,631 --> 01:09:18,951
MATT: "Work on it for a bit, maybe watch some
folks. You'll pick it up right quick, just pay

918
01:09:18,951 --> 01:09:19,846
"attention."

919
01:09:19,846 --> 01:09:23,262
SAM: All right, well, shall we--

920
01:09:23,262 --> 01:09:25,671
TALIESIN: Let's go change, and then let's be off.

921
01:09:25,671 --> 01:09:30,053
MATT: "All right, be safe, friends. Look forward
to your return."

922
01:09:30,053 --> 01:09:32,821
LAURA: Keep everyone safe?

923
01:09:32,821 --> 01:09:36,357
MATT: "That is my purpose."

924
01:09:36,357 --> 01:09:39,790
MARISHA: And Jarett, will you keep an eye on Gilmore
for us?

925
01:09:39,790 --> 01:09:41,663
MATT: "Is he all right?"

926
01:09:41,663 --> 01:09:46,064
MARISHA: I think he's just working himself a bit
much.

927
01:09:46,064 --> 01:09:47,831
LIAM: Stretched a little thin.

928
01:09:47,831 --> 01:09:51,254
MATT: "I may have noticed it myself. I will do
this for you. Promise."

929
01:09:51,254 --> 01:09:52,683
MARISHA: Thank you.

930
01:09:52,683 --> 01:09:54,034
MATT: "My pleasure."

931
01:09:54,034 --> 01:09:56,744
SAM: To Marquet?

932
01:09:56,744 --> 01:09:59,699
TRAVIS: To market!

933
01:09:59,699 --> 01:10:01,770
SAM: To buy a fine pig.

934
01:10:01,843 --> 01:10:02,801
MARISHA: To market!

935
01:10:02,801 --> 01:10:04,323
SAM: Home again, home again.

936
01:10:04,323 --> 01:10:08,802
LAURA: I didn't realize Marquet was like Emon.
This might be a bit difficult, to find a one-eyed

937
01:10:08,802 --> 01:10:11,287
merchant in a city bigger than Emon.

938
01:10:11,287 --> 01:10:16,141
TALIESIN: I think that once we arrive, he'll find
us. Or she.

939
01:10:16,141 --> 01:10:17,841
LAURA: This is true.

940
01:10:17,841 --> 01:10:24,573
SAM: We get there, we start poking people in the
eye until someone doesn't flinch, then we'll know

941
01:10:24,573 --> 01:10:26,450
we found them.

942
01:10:26,450 --> 01:10:31,799
TALIESIN: Can I point out that now we have to
learn an entirely new lore? We've worked so hard,

943
01:10:31,799 --> 01:10:40,642
and now spices? Rivers, canals, fusaka! Oh god,
I'd gotten everything together, and now.

944
01:10:40,642 --> 01:10:43,321
LAURA: We've only got two weeks. Fuck.

945
01:10:43,321 --> 01:10:45,650
TALIESIN: It takes a day to do Disneyland.

946
01:10:45,650 --> 01:10:49,629
SAM: Does anyone speak Marquetian, or do they
speak Common there?

947
01:10:49,629 --> 01:10:54,287
TALIESIN: We'll run into a lot of Common. Common
is common for a reason.

948
01:10:54,287 --> 01:10:56,056
SAM: All right, let's go.

949
01:10:56,056 --> 01:10:59,378
MATT: All right, you guys head back to Gilmore's
place?

950
01:10:59,378 --> 01:11:06,152
LAURA: Oh, but are we going to get some water jugs
and shit like that before we leave?

951
01:11:06,152 --> 01:11:08,162
SAM: Sure, we get some water jugs.

952
01:11:08,162 --> 01:11:09,702
MARISHA: Yeah, more water's good.

953
01:11:09,702 --> 01:11:15,741
MATT: You can pick up a few. We'll say for about
five gold pieces here, you can acquire some jugs

954
01:11:15,741 --> 01:11:19,538
that are compact enough that they'll actually fit
within the Bag of Holding, should you place them.

955
01:11:19,538 --> 01:11:21,210
LIAM: Five gold. Mark it off.

956
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:25,308
(laughter)

957
01:11:25,308 --> 01:11:26,577
TALIESIN: Wow!

958
01:11:26,577 --> 01:11:28,320
SAM: How we doing on potions? We got potions?

959
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:29,752
LAURA: We need to get some potions.

960
01:11:29,752 --> 01:11:33,401
TRAVIS: There's no stores.

961
01:11:33,401 --> 01:11:37,183
MATT: The healing potions that were available in
the city you guys have already taken.

962
01:11:37,183 --> 01:11:39,304
MARISHA: Yeah, we've tapped them out there.

963
01:11:39,304 --> 01:11:41,605
TALIESIN: Yeah, Whitestone is not functioning.

964
01:11:41,605 --> 01:11:43,380
SAM: All right, we'll get some in Marquet.

965
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:45,288
TALIESIN: Trade them for water.

966
01:11:45,288 --> 01:11:46,906
TRAVIS: One for each?

967
01:11:46,906 --> 01:11:50,726
TALIESIN: You stabbed her bear while maintaining
eye contact.

968
01:11:50,726 --> 01:11:52,609
LAURA: How many jugs did we get? Five jugs?

969
01:11:52,609 --> 01:11:53,984
MATT: Five jugs.

970
01:11:53,984 --> 01:11:56,232
MARISHA: Slowly. Very slowly. Oh yeah.

971
01:11:56,232 --> 01:11:59,475
LAURA: And we fill up our wineskins with water.

972
01:11:59,475 --> 01:12:05,024
TALIESIN: We're changing out of the winters into
the lighter clothing.

973
01:12:05,024 --> 01:12:14,666
MARISHA: I bust out some of my clothes from the
Fire Ashari. Go lighter.

974
01:12:14,666 --> 01:12:17,803
TALIESIN: It's a shame Kit's very busy, or else we
could get summer clothes.

975
01:12:17,803 --> 01:12:21,599
MATT: She's so busy getting married or something.

976
01:12:21,599 --> 01:12:23,178
TALIESIN: Getting married or something.

977
01:12:23,178 --> 01:12:27,900
LIAM: I break into a cold sweat, thinking about
the desert and this armor. Oh shit.

978
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:33,201
LAURA: You're going to be a gross, sweaty, greasy
mess.

979
01:12:33,201 --> 01:12:36,088
TALIESIN: Okay, actually there is a solution for
this.

980
01:12:36,088 --> 01:12:40,665
LIAM: Yes, Percival. I have never needed your
intellect more than right now. What is the solution?

981
01:12:40,665 --> 01:12:47,958
TALIESIN: I'm going to find him a white silk and
cotton, linen cloak, very simple, to throw over

982
01:12:47,958 --> 01:12:51,753
his armor the way the Templars used to do, so you
won't cook in your bloody armor.

983
01:12:51,753 --> 01:12:56,042
MARISHA: Does his little sachet--

984
01:12:56,042 --> 01:12:57,915
TALIESIN: Yes, it'll attach to the sachet.

985
01:12:57,915 --> 01:13:03,220
MARISHA: Well, I was going to say, does his sachet
need a re-up of herbs? I thought you

986
01:13:03,220 --> 01:13:05,024
stuffed it with something.

987
01:13:05,024 --> 01:13:13,643
MATT: Percival presents you with a nice, flowing,
light whitish-gray cloak. Ceremonial, within older

988
01:13:13,643 --> 01:13:19,324
Whitestone gatherings. It seems nice; it seems
light.

989
01:13:19,324 --> 01:13:20,952
LIAM: And I can put it over everything else?

990
01:13:20,952 --> 01:13:22,468
LAURA: Over your other cloaks.

991
01:13:22,468 --> 01:13:29,578
LIAM: Cloaks, plural. Fucking 90 episodes later:
cloaks, cloaks, cloaks.

992
01:13:29,578 --> 01:13:32,581
MATT: You can totally place it over your Displacer
Cloak.

993
01:13:32,581 --> 01:13:34,703
TALIESIN: Yeah. It's just a heat sink.

994
01:13:34,703 --> 01:13:37,526
LIAM: Yeah, it's to bounce the heat off.

995
01:13:37,526 --> 01:13:39,273
LAURA: Perfect.

996
01:13:39,273 --> 01:13:42,170
LIAM: Liam knows science. Vax doesn't know shit.

997
01:13:42,170 --> 01:13:45,174
MATT: All right. What's the plan?

998
01:13:45,174 --> 01:13:55,161
SAM: Before we go, quickly, guys. I'm sorry. I
haven't done this yet, so can I try to see where

999
01:13:55,161 --> 01:13:58,328
Kaylie is and do a little scry?

1000
01:13:58,328 --> 01:14:07,297
MATT: You close your eyes and concentrate, and you
see, peeking out from the metallic rim of the

1001
01:14:07,297 --> 01:14:12,498
sword which you gave her, the Aberration's Bane
longsword, you look up and you can see the edge of

1002
01:14:12,498 --> 01:14:21,036
a wooden table. You hear faint music in the
distance; it sounds like some sort of a piano

1003
01:14:21,036 --> 01:14:27,357
being played. No accompaniment, just a straight
piano. You hear distant whispers of conversation,

1004
01:14:27,357 --> 01:14:31,686
the occasional burst of laughter, and you can see
the edge of Kaylie's elbow, leaning against the

1005
01:14:31,686 --> 01:14:40,759
edge of the table. There's a long pause, no
movement. Then all of a sudden, she shifts back

1006
01:14:40,759 --> 01:14:47,993
from the table and goes, "That's right, all the
money on the table's mine. Nice try." Scoops down,

1007
01:14:47,993 --> 01:14:53,713
throwing her hand of cards on the table. You hear
a couple voices go (groaning). You see her

1008
01:14:53,713 --> 01:15:00,783
scoop the coins over and go place them into a coin
bag. "All right, so perhaps another round, then?"

1009
01:15:00,783 --> 01:15:02,965
SAM: Yeah! She's doing good!

1010
01:15:02,965 --> 01:15:11,497
MATT: "Where are you going? Are you a coward or
something?" Shouting this in the distance, as

1011
01:15:11,497 --> 01:15:17,368
apparently the previous people she card sharked
walk off, frustrated and growling. You see one of

1012
01:15:17,368 --> 01:15:23,141
them comes up to the edge of the table and goes,
"Best be giving that money back, little girl or you're--"

1013
01:15:23,141 --> 01:15:27,163
Before that happens, you see a large, meaty hand
grab the back of his neck and pick up him by the

1014
01:15:27,163 --> 01:15:32,764
scruff. You see appear into view the very edge
of Dr. Dranzel's chin and hat and he goes, "I'm

1015
01:15:32,764 --> 01:15:38,663
"sorry, were you talking to my lady friend that
way? That's poor manners." And drops him there at

1016
01:15:38,663 --> 01:15:39,838
the table.

1017
01:15:39,838 --> 01:15:47,055
The guy adjusts himself. "Better not see you guys
in the street." He walks off.

1018
01:15:47,055 --> 01:15:53,714
She reaches her hand up, watching the guy leave,
and fist-bumps Dranzel. Your vision fades back and

1019
01:15:53,714 --> 01:15:55,680
your consciousness comes back to you.

1020
01:15:55,680 --> 01:16:01,289
SAM: She's okay! Okay, good! All right! I feel
good. Let's go!

1021
01:16:01,289 --> 01:16:03,965
LIAM: What were you doing?

1022
01:16:03,965 --> 01:16:07,870
SAM: I had some bad tikka masala earlier.

1023
01:16:07,870 --> 01:16:11,229
LIAM: We haven't even gone to Marquet!

1024
01:16:11,229 --> 01:16:16,477
SAM: They don't have Middle Eastern food there, I hope!

1025
01:16:16,477 --> 01:16:20,283
TALIESIN: Well...

1026
01:16:20,283 --> 01:16:25,915
LIAM: Not going to touch that one.

1027
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:27,834
TRAVIS: Are we going?

1028
01:16:27,834 --> 01:16:29,259
LIAM and TALIESIN: Let's go.

1029
01:16:29,259 --> 01:16:34,155
MATT: All right. You guys make your way back
towards Gilmore's home. At this point in time, you

1030
01:16:34,155 --> 01:16:39,584
come in and find there are a couple of plates,
crumbs to the side. Gilmore's sitting in the chair

1031
01:16:39,584 --> 01:16:48,241
with his tea, eyes closed in a meditative stance.
As soon as you enter the room, he jolts back to

1032
01:16:48,241 --> 01:16:52,651
momentary awareness. "All right! Gathered your
things? Are you ready to go?"

1033
01:16:52,651 --> 01:16:54,748
LIAM: Pretty much.

1034
01:16:54,748 --> 01:17:04,521
MATT: "If you don't mind." He grabs the edge of
the central table in the center of the room with

1035
01:17:04,521 --> 01:17:05,915
the tea on it. He looks towards you.

1036
01:17:05,915 --> 01:17:07,307
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, no problem.

1037
01:17:07,307 --> 01:17:10,868
MATT: You guys shift it, move it to the side,
leaving an open space on the ground. He kneels

1038
01:17:10,868 --> 01:17:16,044
down and places one hand in the center of the
floor. The other hand he reaches back into a small

1039
01:17:16,044 --> 01:17:22,537
pouch on his side and pulls out a small amount of
shimmering, glassy sand material you recognize as

1040
01:17:22,537 --> 01:17:28,082
a hint of residuum processed into its dust
crystallized form. He scatters it around while

1041
01:17:28,082 --> 01:17:33,289
he's muttering under his breath. As he does, with
his hand in the center, you see the dust pull

1042
01:17:33,289 --> 01:17:39,538
together into these small symbols on their own,
almost like magnets to iron filings. They're

1043
01:17:39,538 --> 01:17:45,771
forming into these rigid structures. As they do,
they begin to flare up and glow, and he takes a

1044
01:17:45,771 --> 01:17:52,075
step back, his eyes still closed, brings his fist
together into a grip. As he does, they light up,

1045
01:17:52,075 --> 01:17:57,054
and you recognize this as a teleportation circle.
He goes, "All right, it won't last long. In you go!"

1046
01:17:57,054 --> 01:17:59,902
TRAVIS: Running through!

1047
01:17:59,902 --> 01:18:01,657
LAURA: Thank you, Gilmore!

1048
01:18:01,657 --> 01:18:07,814
MATT: "My pleasure!" is the last thing you hear
before you dive in as it begins to fade. Each of

1049
01:18:07,814 --> 01:18:12,857
you guys step into and transition past,
immediately piling up into each other as you come

1050
01:18:12,857 --> 01:18:18,580
out the other side, as you're in a dark and
enclosed cupboard or closet-type circumstance.

1051
01:18:18,580 --> 01:18:21,319
TALIESIN: I'm reaching for a door handle.

1052
01:18:21,319 --> 01:18:22,537
LAURA: Anywhere.

1053
01:18:22,537 --> 01:18:31,508
MATT: It looks like there is a set of doors to it.
It's a giant armoire. You guys are pushed into it,

1054
01:18:31,508 --> 01:18:33,233
but it is latched over.

1055
01:18:33,233 --> 01:18:35,146
LIAM: Ugh, Grog's pec is right in my eye.

1056
01:18:35,146 --> 01:18:42,036
LAURA: Can I get a little dagger through and flip
the latch?

1057
01:18:42,036 --> 01:18:46,029
MATT: Flick it up. It bursts open, and you all
come stumbling out.

1058
01:18:46,029 --> 01:18:48,905
LIAM: I think he stabbed my eye out! Jeez!

1059
01:18:48,905 --> 01:18:55,531
MATT: As you all stop, Vex, you look back around.
This is a very large dresser-like armoire. It's

1060
01:18:55,531 --> 01:19:01,107
empty. It looks like there are a number of hangers
inside, like it was a place for various outfits to

1061
01:19:01,107 --> 01:19:06,642
be kept and stored. On the floor of the wood, you
can see carved into it a small symbol or a

1062
01:19:06,642 --> 01:19:09,791
<i>sigil,</i> if you will.

1063
01:19:09,791 --> 01:19:13,156
SAM and LAURA: Drink!

1064
01:19:13,156 --> 01:19:16,267
MATT: Marked as the symbol he put.

1065
01:19:16,267 --> 01:19:19,256
LAURA: Good thing no one destroyed this thing
while he was gone.

1066
01:19:19,256 --> 01:19:27,761
MATT: Glancing around, you can see a small dark
wood room atop a wine-red circular carpet in the

1067
01:19:27,761 --> 01:19:34,435
center. Empty shelves and cobwebs fill the
corners. There's a bit of dust and sand coating

1068
01:19:34,435 --> 01:19:41,359
over where the bed rests against the wall. A
closed window hides behind a drawn curtain, with a

1069
01:19:41,359 --> 01:19:45,855
little bit of peeking sunlight making its way
through. There is one single door that sees you

1070
01:19:45,855 --> 01:19:47,947
out, though it is currently closed.

1071
01:19:47,947 --> 01:19:52,964
TALIESIN: I'm going to stand on the carpet and
will it to fly. Seems worth a shot.

1072
01:19:52,964 --> 01:19:54,537
LAURA: Every carpet here.

1073
01:19:54,537 --> 01:19:59,339
MATT: Step onto the carpet, close your eyes. How
do you will it?

1074
01:19:59,339 --> 01:20:04,342
TALIESIN: I do believe in fairies. I <i>do</i> believe
in fairies. I know it; I've killed several of

1075
01:20:04,342 --> 01:20:06,324
them. They're definitely real.

1076
01:20:06,324 --> 01:20:09,324
MATT: Moments pass, no effect.

1077
01:20:09,324 --> 01:20:14,250
LIAM: I'm going to do my due diligence and make
sure the door's okay. Probably is, but just in case.

1078
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:15,925
TALIESIN: I'm going to look out the window, as
well.

1079
01:20:15,925 --> 01:20:18,622
LAURA: I look under the bed.

1080
01:20:18,622 --> 01:20:26,457
LIAM: 22. Just to make sure that it's not trapped
or locked.

1081
01:20:26,457 --> 01:20:33,696
MATT: The door is locked. It is not trapped.
You're peeking out the window, you said?

1082
01:20:33,696 --> 01:20:34,787
TALIESIN: Yeah, I am.

1083
01:20:34,787 --> 01:20:39,381
MATT: You glance through the cloth, and it looks
like it is a glass window, but it is partially

1084
01:20:39,381 --> 01:20:44,309
opened and looks like there's a little cluster of
sand that's gathered over time underneath the

1085
01:20:44,309 --> 01:20:48,105
sill, from what little bit the wind's pushed
through. Glancing out as soon as you push out, the

1086
01:20:48,105 --> 01:20:51,197
light is very bright, and you have to take a
moment for your eyes to adjust. Looking out, you

1087
01:20:51,197 --> 01:20:59,515
see a simple street. There are some small
buildings built of fine wood; nothing too

1088
01:20:59,515 --> 01:21:05,420
extravagant. You can see a number of trees that
protrude from the sand: long, tall, thin, palm

1089
01:21:05,420 --> 01:21:12,788
frond-type tops to them, bearing some sort of
large nut-like fruit. You can see what look to be

1090
01:21:12,788 --> 01:21:16,997
small troughs of gathered water, whether it be
from rain or them placed there intentionally, but

1091
01:21:16,997 --> 01:21:25,193
they're currently locked with some
semi-translucent top and chained shut, on the

1092
01:21:25,193 --> 01:21:28,779
outside of two of the buildings. You do see a few
people walking back up and down the street.

1093
01:21:28,779 --> 01:21:33,589
General civilians, all dressed in longer,
full-body robes, some of them with scarves around

1094
01:21:33,589 --> 01:21:40,453
their neck. I wouldn't say peasants, per se, but
definitely not well-off in their appearance.

1095
01:21:40,453 --> 01:21:46,696
Casual civilians. Darker skin, looks like they've
definitely been living in the desert for a long

1096
01:21:46,696 --> 01:21:50,909
time. That is what you can see from the window's
point of view.

1097
01:21:50,909 --> 01:21:53,729
TALIESIN: Are we on the first floor or second
floor?

1098
01:21:53,729 --> 01:21:55,878
MATT: Currently, you're on the first floor.

1099
01:21:55,878 --> 01:22:03,057
SAM: Is there a second floor?

1100
01:22:03,057 --> 01:22:04,532
MATT: You don't know.

1101
01:22:04,532 --> 01:22:09,964
SAM: Are there stairs? Oh, we're in a room. Let's
go out the room. What could happen?

1102
01:22:09,964 --> 01:22:19,714
MATT: Looking under the bed, you see what appears
to be a small wooden box that is closed and hidden

1103
01:22:19,714 --> 01:22:27,059
toward the very back, and what appears to be a
small series of shirts that have been folded up

1104
01:22:27,059 --> 01:22:29,303
and have gathered a lot of dust over the top of
them.

1105
01:22:29,303 --> 01:22:30,572
LAURA: Can I reach them?

1106
01:22:30,572 --> 01:22:39,704
MATT: Yeah. Pull them out. Really nice,
high-quality silk and cotton based, embroidered

1107
01:22:39,704 --> 01:22:44,959
shirts. Look more ceremonial, special event type,
long, maybe knee-length.

1108
01:22:44,959 --> 01:22:47,762
MARISHA: What's the decoration like in the room?

1109
01:22:47,762 --> 01:22:57,038
MATT: Currently, it's pretty bland. You can see a
couple of colored tapestries similar to the center

1110
01:22:57,038 --> 01:23:01,635
of the floor rug that are hanging, but there are a
lot of blank areas. It looks like decorations have

1111
01:23:01,635 --> 01:23:05,495
been removed, or at least haven't been there for a
long time. The room, for the most part, seems to

1112
01:23:05,495 --> 01:23:07,582
be abandoned.

1113
01:23:07,582 --> 01:23:09,104
LAURA: Is the box trapped?

1114
01:23:09,104 --> 01:23:14,292
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1115
01:23:14,292 --> 01:23:20,294
LAURA: Almost good, and then not. 14.

1116
01:23:20,294 --> 01:23:24,404
MATT: 14? It does not appear to be trapped.

1117
01:23:24,404 --> 01:23:25,592
LAURA: Can I open it?

1118
01:23:25,592 --> 01:23:30,737
MATT: You do. Open it up, glance inside. It looks
to be a series of folded papers.

1119
01:23:30,737 --> 01:23:33,353
LAURA: Is it Gilmore's stuff?

1120
01:23:33,353 --> 01:23:36,137
LIAM: Yeah, you're going through Shaun's shit.
What are you doing?

1121
01:23:36,137 --> 01:23:37,910
LAURA: I'm just seeing if this is his room!

1122
01:23:37,910 --> 01:23:40,917
MARISHA: Ooh, whispers.

1123
01:23:40,917 --> 01:23:42,629
TRAVIS: Oh shitballs. I have to move.

1124
01:23:42,629 --> 01:23:46,263
MARISHA: How are those Cowboys doing, Travis?

1125
01:23:46,263 --> 01:23:47,553
TRAVIS: Ten-ten, halftime.

1126
01:23:47,553 --> 01:23:49,096
MARISHA: Oh snap.

1127
01:23:49,096 --> 01:23:51,913
TALIESIN: Is that a good thing, ten-ten at
halftime?

1128
01:23:51,913 --> 01:23:53,421
TRAVIS: No, not good.

1129
01:23:53,421 --> 01:23:55,009
TALIESIN: That's not good? Okay.

1130
01:23:55,009 --> 01:23:56,661
TRAVIS: Their starting quarterback got hurt.

1131
01:23:56,661 --> 01:23:59,412
TALIESIN: I understood all those words
individually.

1132
01:23:59,412 --> 01:24:01,213
TRAVIS: Because he's an old woman.

1133
01:24:01,213 --> 01:24:02,845
TALIESIN: I know those words, as well.

1134
01:24:02,845 --> 01:24:05,675
LIAM: Speaking in Half-Orc. Don't speak that.

1135
01:24:05,675 --> 01:24:14,031
TALIESIN: I would pay good money to have you
explain how football works to me.

1136
01:24:14,031 --> 01:24:17,947
TRAVIS: That's what I was going with that!

1137
01:24:17,947 --> 01:24:21,852
LAURA: Okay. I fold them back up and I put them
under the bed.

1138
01:24:21,852 --> 01:24:25,253
LIAM: Can I read your diary, then? Is that all
right?

1139
01:24:25,253 --> 01:24:29,128
LAURA: I was seeing if we were in Gilmore's room,
that's all.

1140
01:24:29,128 --> 01:24:30,044
LIAM: Yeah?

1141
01:24:30,044 --> 01:24:30,862
LAURA: Yeah.

1142
01:24:30,862 --> 01:24:32,042
LIAM: All right.

1143
01:24:32,042 --> 01:24:35,521
LAURA: Don't act like I'm a dick. I'm not
stealing the letters. I'm putting the shirts back,

1144
01:24:35,521 --> 01:24:36,584
all right?

1145
01:24:36,584 --> 01:24:42,159
LIAM: I didn't say it! Just maybe he wants a
little privacy. I don't know! Think about it.

1146
01:24:42,159 --> 01:24:45,635
MARISHA: She's learned from you well.

1147
01:24:45,635 --> 01:24:48,863
LAURA: Is the door open? Can we go out of here?

1148
01:24:48,863 --> 01:24:50,478
SAM: Did you find anything good?

1149
01:24:50,478 --> 01:24:52,297
LIAM: If 25 opens the door, then it's opened.

1150
01:24:52,297 --> 01:24:56,262
MATT: It's easy enough, like butter. (creaking
door) The door opens.

1151
01:24:56,262 --> 01:24:59,674
MARISHA: He did say we would meet his family.

1152
01:24:59,674 --> 01:25:07,844
MATT: As the door opens up, immediately, your nose
catches the smell of sage and cooked meats. As the

1153
01:25:07,844 --> 01:25:13,746
door opens, you look into a large room to your
left with some furniture, not too extravagant, but

1154
01:25:13,746 --> 01:25:22,114
nice, and a humble living space. As the door opens
the other way, you look to the right, and you see

1155
01:25:22,114 --> 01:25:31,378
two figures sitting at a table, seemingly eating.
An older couple, with dark sun-weathered skin,

1156
01:25:31,378 --> 01:25:36,226
graying hair, and bright eyes. They look confused
and slightly scared at their table, staring back

1157
01:25:36,226 --> 01:25:38,755
at people wandering into the middle of the room.

1158
01:25:38,755 --> 01:25:40,065
TRAVIS: It's okay.

1159
01:25:40,065 --> 01:25:41,056
MARISHA: Hi!

1160
01:25:41,056 --> 01:25:42,126
TALIESIN: This is a bit awkward.

1161
01:25:42,126 --> 01:25:43,383
SAM: We're friends of Gilmore.

1162
01:25:43,383 --> 01:25:44,728
LAURA: Shaun.

1163
01:25:44,728 --> 01:25:47,281
MATT: They both look at each other.

1164
01:25:47,281 --> 01:25:48,581
SAM: Oh, be pleased.

1165
01:25:48,581 --> 01:25:50,559
TRAVIS: Bees knees.

1166
01:25:50,559 --> 01:25:57,670
MATT: They both look to each other and then
immediately begin, mouths filled with food,

1167
01:25:57,670 --> 01:26:07,247
laughing. (laughs) "This is unexpected. Friends of
Shaun's, you say?"

1168
01:26:07,247 --> 01:26:08,813
ALL: Yes.

1169
01:26:08,813 --> 01:26:13,679
MATT: The man himself stands up and begins to walk
over, wiping the edge of his mouth with a small

1170
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:20,936
piece of cloth, finishing chewing and swallowing
the food he has currently. As he walks up, the man

1171
01:26:20,936 --> 01:26:30,511
has thinning white hair that grows long, straight
down towards his back, simple long robe-like dress

1172
01:26:30,511 --> 01:26:36,423
with simple cloth pants that go round these
slipper-like shoes on his feet. He approaches.

1173
01:26:36,423 --> 01:26:39,163
Which one said Shaun?

1174
01:26:39,163 --> 01:26:41,532
SAM: You said Gilmore.

1175
01:26:41,532 --> 01:26:48,240
MATT: Gilmore and Shaun. Approaches you, as you,
stepping forward as one of the more, you know,

1176
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:54,241
assertive members of the party, and goes, "How is he? If you
could please tell me?"

1177
01:26:54,241 --> 01:27:01,963
LAURA: He's quite well. He's very powerful,
actually, and has wonderful businesses, all

1178
01:27:01,963 --> 01:27:03,491
through--

1179
01:27:03,491 --> 01:27:05,286
MARISHA: Tal'Dorei?

1180
01:27:05,286 --> 01:27:08,556
LAURA: No, I know. It's just not there anymore.

1181
01:27:08,556 --> 01:27:11,222
MATT: "Opesa. Opesa, come."

1182
01:27:11,222 --> 01:27:17,221
And the woman gets up from the table. "Yes, I'm
sorry. It has been a while since we've had guests

1183
01:27:17,221 --> 01:27:24,971
"from so strange and sudden arrivals!" She walks up
and pulls these small glasses out from her pocket

1184
01:27:24,971 --> 01:27:30,876
and puts them on. You can see her eyes open up
wide behind them, and she comes, leans to the side

1185
01:27:30,876 --> 01:27:32,928
and puts her arm around him. They both hold each
other.

1186
01:27:32,928 --> 01:27:44,422
He goes, "I am sorry. Let me introduce. I am Soren
Geddmore. This is Opesa Geddmore. You know our son?"

1187
01:27:44,422 --> 01:27:49,000
LIAM: Yes, for quite some time.

1188
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:52,497
MATT: "And you say he does well with his
business?"

1189
01:27:52,497 --> 01:27:54,438
LAURA: He does. So well, yes.

1190
01:27:54,438 --> 01:27:55,891
TALIESIN: Continental.

1191
01:27:55,891 --> 01:27:57,522
MATT: "This is good."

1192
01:27:57,522 --> 01:27:58,779
LAURA: Very respected.

1193
01:27:58,779 --> 01:28:00,571
LIAM: Yes, and brave.

1194
01:28:00,571 --> 01:28:04,664
MATT: "He has always been a brave one."

1195
01:28:04,664 --> 01:28:08,944
SAM: Single-handedly protecting a whole city right
now.

1196
01:28:08,944 --> 01:28:15,323
MATT: "You don't have to embellish. That's okay.
Would you like to eat with us? We can make more

1197
01:28:15,323 --> 01:28:16,692
"food, yes?"

1198
01:28:16,692 --> 01:28:19,834
LAURA: Actually, we need to head out pretty
quickly.

1199
01:28:19,834 --> 01:28:21,935
TALIESIN: We're sadly on a mission.

1200
01:28:21,935 --> 01:28:26,506
LAURA: Can you tell us the direction to
Ank'Harel?

1201
01:28:26,506 --> 01:28:28,571
MATT: "You are going to Ank'Harel?"

1202
01:28:28,571 --> 01:28:29,578
LAURA: Yes.

1203
01:28:29,578 --> 01:28:36,047
MATT: "Yes. Follow me." He takes her by the arm,
and they both walk arm-in-arm, leading you guys to

1204
01:28:36,047 --> 01:28:42,655
what looks to be a front door of this abode. As he
pushes it open, revealing more of the street of

1205
01:28:42,655 --> 01:28:50,846
this small oasis town, he goes, "Let's see, if you
follow-- that is the sun." He looks up, and you

1206
01:28:50,846 --> 01:28:57,529
see his eyes adjust to the brighter sky. "The sun
is there. It will be setting... that direction.

1207
01:28:57,529 --> 01:29:02,838
"Continue... what is the word you speak?"

1208
01:29:02,838 --> 01:29:05,885
SAM: North, northwest. No, northeast.

1209
01:29:05,885 --> 01:29:10,049
MATT: "That is west. You want to north, so go that
way. Yes. That is where you want to go."

1210
01:29:10,049 --> 01:29:11,195
LAURA: Thank you.

1211
01:29:11,195 --> 01:29:15,512
SAM: Is there a road to follow, or is it just a
direction?

1212
01:29:15,512 --> 01:29:21,649
MATT: "I haven't been in many years. As far as I
know, there are signs. There are not roads. There

1213
01:29:21,649 --> 01:29:23,723
"are guides you could hire to bring you there."

1214
01:29:23,723 --> 01:29:31,372
MARISHA: Can I do like a nature check or take note
of what he said so I remember? Because that was vague.

1215
01:29:31,372 --> 01:29:38,467
LAURA: I'm assuming these are the people that
Gilmore said I would know.

1216
01:29:38,467 --> 01:29:41,261
MATT: You get the sense these are probably who he
was referring to.

1217
01:29:41,261 --> 01:29:47,944
LAURA: Yes, so as she's doing that, I want to pull
out the locket and say, actually, Shaun asked me

1218
01:29:47,944 --> 01:29:50,067
to deliver this to you.

1219
01:29:50,067 --> 01:29:53,282
MATT: "What--" And he looks to his wife.

1220
01:29:53,282 --> 01:30:01,447
The woman steps forward adjusting her glasses.
"Thank you so much!" She holds it and opens it up.

1221
01:30:01,447 --> 01:30:07,594
Looks over to him and shows him. You get a bit of
a glance, at that point. You can see it's a

1222
01:30:07,594 --> 01:30:17,252
picture of Gilmore. He's happy. Jewel-encrusted
rings. It's almost a promotional still, if there

1223
01:30:17,252 --> 01:30:27,736
was one, for Gilmore's Glorious Goods. She takes
it. She closes it and goes, "Gilmore is originally

1224
01:30:27,736 --> 01:30:38,603
"Geddmore. He changed his name when he went for
better business to the Tal'Dorei place. Glad he's

1225
01:30:38,603 --> 01:30:40,141
"doing well."

1226
01:30:40,141 --> 01:30:43,349
TALIESIN: He's respected across the continent.

1227
01:30:43,349 --> 01:30:46,263
LIAM: Is there anything we can let him know?

1228
01:30:46,263 --> 01:30:56,374
MATT: "Give him our love and tell him he is more
than welcome to visit. It has been many years."

1229
01:30:56,374 --> 01:30:58,004
LIAM: We will.

1230
01:30:58,004 --> 01:31:00,240
LAURA: Thank you.

1231
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:05,623
MATT: "Not a worry. Safe travels. You're sure you
don't wish to have food?"

1232
01:31:05,623 --> 01:31:15,029
LIAM: No, but if you could point us towards
fusaka? Is there any around here? There's not, is there?

1233
01:31:15,029 --> 01:31:22,749
MATT: They both look at each other. "I'm not
familiar with this spice you speak of. My apologies."

1234
01:31:22,749 --> 01:31:28,272
She's like, "I'm sorry. I do not know this fusaka
you speak of."

1235
01:31:28,272 --> 01:31:29,819
LIAM: He's pulling our chain.

1236
01:31:29,819 --> 01:31:31,932
SAM: Or maybe it's something illicit.

1237
01:31:31,932 --> 01:31:33,508
LAURA and TALIESIN: It's possible.

1238
01:31:33,508 --> 01:31:35,243
SAM: Or something that you snort.

1239
01:31:35,243 --> 01:31:36,606
LIAM: He's pretty cool.

1240
01:31:36,606 --> 01:31:40,026
LAURA: I understand.

1241
01:31:40,026 --> 01:31:41,781
TALIESIN: Can we leave them a bit of water?

1242
01:31:41,781 --> 01:31:43,082
SAM: Yeah, we should leave them some water.

1243
01:31:43,082 --> 01:31:44,297
LAURA: Oh yes.

1244
01:31:44,297 --> 01:31:46,090
SAM: Grog! Water boy?

1245
01:31:46,090 --> 01:31:47,141
TRAVIS: Yes?

1246
01:31:47,141 --> 01:31:48,720
LAURA: Can you give them some water from our jug?

1247
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:50,046
TALIESIN: Where do you keep your personal water?

1248
01:31:50,046 --> 01:31:51,567
LAURA: Would you like some water?

1249
01:31:51,567 --> 01:32:04,700
TRAVIS: I got it. Here, take this jug of water
with our compliments. You said give them a jug!

1250
01:32:04,700 --> 01:32:07,244
TALIESIN: Where do you store your water in the
house?

1251
01:32:07,244 --> 01:32:13,872
MATT: "We have, around this way--" He leads you
towards the back of this small kitchen. It's very

1252
01:32:13,872 --> 01:32:21,503
condensed. You can see there is a high metal
fence, and there appears to be a rainwater

1253
01:32:21,503 --> 01:32:28,450
receptacle there, like a well that is built into
the homestead. It has chains over the top. He

1254
01:32:28,450 --> 01:32:33,503
begins to pull keys out and lock to it, and as he
pulls off the chains one by one, he pulls back the

1255
01:32:33,503 --> 01:32:39,643
lid, this hard, dry wooden lid, and within it is
a very deep well, though it looks like the water

1256
01:32:39,643 --> 01:32:43,152
level's maybe ten feet down from the top of the
well right now.

1257
01:32:43,152 --> 01:32:47,361
TRAVIS: You want me to pour the Alchemy Jug in
here? Or just one of the little ones?

1258
01:32:47,361 --> 01:32:50,514
TALIESIN: Pour the Alchemy. The little one's for
us today. The Alchemy Jug, this is where it's going.

1259
01:32:50,514 --> 01:32:55,630
TRAVIS: All right, I take the Alchemy Jug and I
go: You want to see a trick? Look inside. Do you

1260
01:32:55,630 --> 01:32:57,112
see anything?

1261
01:32:57,112 --> 01:32:58,777
MATT: "Hey, Opesa, do you see anything?"

1262
01:32:58,777 --> 01:33:01,635
And she blinks a bit. "No, it's empty."

1263
01:33:01,635 --> 01:33:06,104
TRAVIS: And I say: Now, give it a listen. And I
shake it. What do you hear?

1264
01:33:06,104 --> 01:33:10,384
MATT: "Nothing. You are a strange man."

1265
01:33:10,384 --> 01:33:13,468
(laughter)

1266
01:33:13,468 --> 01:33:18,923
TRAVIS: Forgot they're old. Right, well, it
sounds-- fuck it. Water. And I start pouring.

1267
01:33:18,923 --> 01:33:20,488
(laughter)

1268
01:33:20,488 --> 01:33:21,780
MATT: How much water does it create?

1269
01:33:21,780 --> 01:33:23,953
TRAVIS: It creates eight gallons of fresh water.

1270
01:33:23,953 --> 01:33:32,219
MATT: Oh wow. "You are still a very strange man,
but I'm very happy and appreciative."

1271
01:33:32,219 --> 01:33:34,391
TRAVIS: I am a great sorcerer.

1272
01:33:34,391 --> 01:33:40,875
MATT: "All right. I can see, now. Gilmore has his
work cut out for him."

1273
01:33:40,875 --> 01:33:42,423
TRAVIS: Gedd-e-mo-ray.

1274
01:33:42,423 --> 01:33:55,364
MATT: He pats your shoulder. "Geddmore, indeed."
As you finish pouring the water out, they lead you

1275
01:33:55,364 --> 01:33:57,254
guys back to the front.

1276
01:33:57,254 --> 01:33:58,934
LAURA: What time is it here?

1277
01:33:58,934 --> 01:34:09,861
MATT: He pulls out a small sundial from his
pocket, holds it up. "It would be closer to late afternoon."

1278
01:34:09,861 --> 01:34:20,299
LAURA: No, we aren't going to make it to Ank'Harel
by dark. Yes, of course. That's all. Thank you!

1279
01:34:20,299 --> 01:34:22,269
MATT: "Well, thank you so much for coming."

1280
01:34:22,269 --> 01:34:23,337
TALIESIN: Good day.

1281
01:34:23,337 --> 01:34:24,905
TRAVIS: Beep-beep!

1282
01:34:24,905 --> 01:34:26,935
SAM, TALIESIN, and LIAM: Be pleased.

1283
01:34:26,935 --> 01:34:34,263
MATT: "Be pleased." And they both, in a very rusty
joints way, give you both a bow as you leave.

1284
01:34:34,263 --> 01:34:37,221
LIAM: They were a couple of sweethearts.

1285
01:34:37,221 --> 01:34:43,793
SAM: They are adorable! They're both over 70, so
who's going to kill them? Should Grog, or should I?

1286
01:34:43,793 --> 01:34:45,662
TALIESIN: I think it's our turn.

1287
01:34:45,662 --> 01:34:47,566
LAURA: You broke him!

1288
01:34:47,566 --> 01:34:49,988
SAM: You kill one, I'll kill the other.

1289
01:34:49,988 --> 01:34:51,885
LIAM: Throwback Thursday.

1290
01:34:51,885 --> 01:34:54,124
TALIESIN: This is what a d10 is for. Hold on, one
second.

1291
01:34:54,124 --> 01:35:00,535
MARISHA: Do we have any more reason to be here? Or
should we start heading off to Ank'Harel?

1292
01:35:00,535 --> 01:35:01,924
TALIESIN: I think we head off to Ank'Harel.

1293
01:35:01,924 --> 01:35:03,981
LAURA: Yeah, unless we see any kind of potion
shops here.

1294
01:35:03,981 --> 01:35:06,672
MARISHA: I can mist us. I brought it today.

1295
01:35:06,672 --> 01:35:09,677
TALIESIN: Oh. We can mist.

1296
01:35:09,677 --> 01:35:14,290
LIAM: Is there enough moisture in the air? I have
no idea how it works.

1297
01:35:14,290 --> 01:35:17,426
TRAVIS: Shit, if we evaporate, I'll be so pissed.

1298
01:35:17,426 --> 01:35:20,489
MARISHA: Wait. Can that happen?

1299
01:35:20,489 --> 01:35:23,441
TRAVIS: You don't know!

1300
01:35:23,441 --> 01:35:25,317
TALIESIN: I think it'll be fine.

1301
01:35:25,317 --> 01:35:26,962
MARISHA: Because we're mist.

1302
01:35:26,962 --> 01:35:30,767
TALIESIN: We're mostly water. I think it's our
water. I think we end up very dehydrated at the

1303
01:35:30,767 --> 01:35:32,015
end of it.

1304
01:35:32,015 --> 01:35:34,746
MARISHA: Sorry, I just spit all over you. I'm
sorry.

1305
01:35:34,746 --> 01:35:36,228
TALIESIN: It's okay. Now I'm moister.

1306
01:35:36,228 --> 01:35:37,992
MARISHA: That's how mist form works.

1307
01:35:37,992 --> 01:35:40,738
TRAVIS: Now I'm <i>moisture.</i>

1308
01:35:40,738 --> 01:35:45,630
MARISHA: I don't think we'd evaporate. I think
he's fucking with us. I don't think we'd

1309
01:35:45,630 --> 01:35:46,756
evaporate.

1310
01:35:46,756 --> 01:35:48,400
LAURA: Let's mist it.

1311
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:56,262
MATT: That would be the saddest TPK ever. "Let's
go, guys!" And so ends the journey of Vox

1312
01:35:56,262 --> 01:35:57,265
Machina.

1313
01:35:57,265 --> 01:36:00,529
(laughter)

1314
01:36:00,529 --> 01:36:05,076
MARISHA: They fade into existence!

1315
01:36:05,076 --> 01:36:07,520
LAURA: That would be the worst thing ever.

1316
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:10,375
TALIESIN: Was that a global warming metaphor?

1317
01:36:10,375 --> 01:36:21,424
TRAVIS: No songs to be sung. Just fucking another
cloud in the fucking sky.

1318
01:36:21,424 --> 01:36:26,417
SAM: Some say you can see them still, overhead.

1319
01:36:26,417 --> 01:36:30,664
(laughter)

1320
01:36:30,664 --> 01:36:35,528
MARISHA: I don't think we'll evaporate.

1321
01:36:35,528 --> 01:36:37,391
LAURA: Let's do it.

1322
01:36:37,391 --> 01:36:38,656
SAM: We're going to mist it?

1323
01:36:38,656 --> 01:36:40,644
MARISHA: Do we need anything else while we're
here, before I do this?

1324
01:36:40,644 --> 01:36:42,072
TALIESIN: It's a one-camel town.

1325
01:36:42,072 --> 01:36:43,678
MARISHA: I mist us.

1326
01:36:43,678 --> 01:36:48,569
MATT: All right. As you guys take a moment to
concentrate, each one of you transforms into mist.

1327
01:36:48,569 --> 01:36:54,522
As you begin to go one by the other, you do hear a
couple of (gasps). You glance over your shoulder

1328
01:36:54,522 --> 01:36:59,718
to see three kids, all looking up at you all with
these big, scared smiles.

1329
01:36:59,718 --> 01:37:06,400
MARISHA: Before I go, I say: stay in school, kids.
And then I mist.

1330
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:08,218
TALIESIN: I'm going to Slimer the kid.

1331
01:37:08,218 --> 01:37:15,570
LAURA: As I turn into mist, I go: I'm melting!
Melting! Oh, what a world!

1332
01:37:15,570 --> 01:37:17,038
MATT: Make a deception check.

1333
01:37:17,038 --> 01:37:19,221
MARISHA: I was trying to inspire them!

1334
01:37:19,221 --> 01:37:22,685
TALIESIN: You're a <i>terrible</i> person!

1335
01:37:22,685 --> 01:37:26,475
LAURA: 20.

1336
01:37:26,475 --> 01:37:29,546
LIAM: Do they speak Common?

1337
01:37:29,546 --> 01:37:35,269
MATT: After you give your presentation, they,
"Whoa!" As you begin transforming, you do that and

1338
01:37:35,269 --> 01:37:38,933
they go, (terrified screaming) and go running
indoors.

1339
01:37:38,933 --> 01:37:40,876
TALIESIN: I'm still going to slime them on their
way out.

1340
01:37:40,876 --> 01:37:42,504
MARISHA: Sliming them!

1341
01:37:42,504 --> 01:37:44,183
SAM: We're tormenting children.

1342
01:37:44,183 --> 01:37:46,635
LIAM: Hey, that's a step up for us!

1343
01:37:46,635 --> 01:37:48,717
MATT: That's what Vox Machina is all about.

1344
01:37:48,717 --> 01:37:52,264
TALIESIN: Scarring children for life.

1345
01:37:52,264 --> 01:37:55,053
TRAVIS: If you can't kill the old, terrify the
young.

1346
01:37:55,053 --> 01:38:01,031
TALIESIN: We're leaving them with a promise that
we'll be back to finish the job.

1347
01:38:01,031 --> 01:38:14,033
MATT: You are terrible people. You guys rise into
the air as the sun begins to bring itself to set

1348
01:38:14,033 --> 01:38:25,202
in the west. You shift up over the city. You look
down. Probably maybe 150, 200 buildings make up

1349
01:38:25,202 --> 01:38:33,644
the entirety of Shandal. It's not a very large
town, but you can see little dots of moving

1350
01:38:33,644 --> 01:38:39,879
caravans both to and from the city. It is a fairly
lively stop for people traveling to and from

1351
01:38:39,879 --> 01:38:41,035
Ank'Harel.

1352
01:38:41,035 --> 01:38:42,511
TALIESIN: We can follow traffic.

1353
01:38:42,511 --> 01:38:44,655
MARISHA: Follow traffic.

1354
01:38:44,655 --> 01:38:46,059
TALIESIN: There's a traffic line, then.

1355
01:38:46,059 --> 01:38:51,571
MATT: Every now and then. As you follow the
direction they're going, you're traveling much

1356
01:38:51,571 --> 01:39:00,464
faster than they are. The hot air does feel a
little uncomfortable against your cloud-based

1357
01:39:00,464 --> 01:39:05,624
misty forms, but you do not feel like it's
responsible for evaporating any of your form.

1358
01:39:05,624 --> 01:39:07,935
MARISHA: Yeah, we're just sweating a little bit
more.

1359
01:39:07,935 --> 01:39:14,925
MATT: You're like, "oh this is 
uncomfortable." You continue to press forward as

1360
01:39:14,925 --> 01:39:19,793
the sun slowly begins to set. The temperature
begins to get colder and colder, and the sky grows

1361
01:39:19,793 --> 01:39:20,720
darker.

1362
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:23,540
MARISHA: Do we condense a little bit? Turn into a
low-lying fog? Never mind.

1363
01:39:23,540 --> 01:39:26,164
MATT: If you'd like to. It's up to you entirely.
The form is your choice.

1364
01:39:26,164 --> 01:39:28,004
TRAVIS: Could we turn into a marine layer?

1365
01:39:28,004 --> 01:39:29,872
MATT: You continue to travel throughout the
night?

1366
01:39:29,872 --> 01:39:33,424
SAM: How long does this thing last?

1367
01:39:33,424 --> 01:39:35,635
LAURA: Eight hours, right? It lasts eight hours?

1368
01:39:35,635 --> 01:39:37,200
SAM: We'll travel eight hours.

1369
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:40,732
TALIESIN: We'll take a late night. Once it wears
off, then we'll camp.

1370
01:39:40,732 --> 01:39:43,580
LAURA: Can we get the whole way there?

1371
01:39:43,580 --> 01:39:50,423
MARISHA: Wind Walk, you said it was a day's
journey, and we can travel faster by Wind

1372
01:39:50,423 --> 01:39:51,368
Walking.

1373
01:39:51,368 --> 01:39:53,599
SAM: At night, will we know where northeast is?

1374
01:39:53,599 --> 01:39:56,059
LAURA: Yeah, I've got an excellent sense of
direction.

1375
01:39:56,059 --> 01:39:59,380
TALIESIN: If it's only a day's travel, at some
point we're going to see the city.

1376
01:39:59,380 --> 01:40:03,774
MARISHA: I think we should be able to get there,
right?

1377
01:40:03,774 --> 01:40:07,345
LAURA: And we can camp just outside the city,
maybe?

1378
01:40:07,345 --> 01:40:09,074
SAM: Okay. Let's do it.

1379
01:40:09,074 --> 01:40:11,586
MARISHA: Because we have a flying speed of 300
feet.

1380
01:40:11,586 --> 01:40:23,418
MATT: Yes, you guys cruise. You guys push forward
for another four to five hours post-dusk. You're

1381
01:40:23,418 --> 01:40:29,804
now hitting the early hours of the morning before
you begin to see in the distance hundreds of

1382
01:40:29,804 --> 01:40:39,256
sparking lights begin to appear up above a distant
sand dune. You can see the lit lights, lanterns,

1383
01:40:39,256 --> 01:40:45,832
and general glowing night life of a massive city
over the high walls that surround its exterior.

1384
01:40:45,832 --> 01:40:53,493
This is a pretty amazing sight for those of you
who have not been to such a large desert

1385
01:40:53,493 --> 01:40:59,682
atmosphere, and it is pitch black below you, and
at the height you're traveling-- How high are you

1386
01:40:59,682 --> 01:41:01,974
traveling versus the ground? I guess I should
ask.

1387
01:41:01,974 --> 01:41:03,311
TALIESIN: 300 feet?

1388
01:41:03,311 --> 01:41:08,890
MARISHA: An appropriate cloud height.

1389
01:41:08,890 --> 01:41:12,232
SAM: That's thousands.

1390
01:41:12,232 --> 01:41:16,211
MARISHA: Hundreds. A couple hundred feet.

1391
01:41:16,211 --> 01:41:31,992
MATT: Okay. From this view, you can see a large
queue about eight heavy caravan carts long of

1392
01:41:31,992 --> 01:41:37,568
caravans that have camped for the night outside of
the front main gates. You do see, along the line

1393
01:41:37,568 --> 01:41:43,800
of the outer wall, there appear to be a number of
small spires that open up like guard tower

1394
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:50,616
parapets that come to a pointed, what looks like a
hand, cradling the outside of each section of the

1395
01:41:50,616 --> 01:41:59,886
wall on the outside, but on the inside, you see a
hundred or more of these long, multi-level spires

1396
01:41:59,886 --> 01:42:07,866
that progress all throughout the city, and it goes
on and on in its large oval-like shape. It's hard

1397
01:42:07,866 --> 01:42:13,734
to make out much color other than the thousand
small lights you see throughout the entire city.

1398
01:42:13,734 --> 01:42:21,251
Orange, yellows, greens, blues. It is a beautiful
view. What is your plan?

1399
01:42:21,251 --> 01:42:23,692
TALIESIN: I say we camp outside.

1400
01:42:23,692 --> 01:42:25,231
LIAM: Are we still clouds, though?

1401
01:42:25,231 --> 01:42:26,340
TALIESIN: We're still clouds.

1402
01:42:26,340 --> 01:42:27,570
LIAM: Can't talk at all.

1403
01:42:27,570 --> 01:42:28,939
LAURA: Should we mist down?

1404
01:42:28,939 --> 01:42:31,225
SAM: Are we getting to the end of our eight hours
anyway?

1405
01:42:31,225 --> 01:42:33,840
MARISHA: It's been five or six.

1406
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:35,031
LAURA: It's still night?

1407
01:42:35,031 --> 01:42:36,335
MATT: Still night, yes.

1408
01:42:36,335 --> 01:42:37,743
LAURA: It's good to camp.

1409
01:42:37,743 --> 01:42:40,196
MATT: It's two in the morning, at this point.

1410
01:42:40,196 --> 01:42:48,197
MARISHA: Does there look like any patch of shrubs
or a low point in the terrain? Cover.

1411
01:42:48,197 --> 01:42:50,083
MATT: You can't tell from this height,
unfortunately.

1412
01:42:50,083 --> 01:42:51,549
LAURA: We mist down a little bit.

1413
01:42:51,549 --> 01:43:00,941
MATT: You scoot down around the outside of the
city walls. The landscape here near the town

1414
01:43:00,941 --> 01:43:11,568
appears to be more packed and hardened badland
dust and sand. You can see where lots of it, from

1415
01:43:11,568 --> 01:43:17,093
a recent rain, have caked and hardened and then
broken in places. It leaves this soft, shale-type

1416
01:43:17,093 --> 01:43:23,941
texture to it that breaks into sand upon crumbling
underfoot. From what you can see, there are a

1417
01:43:23,941 --> 01:43:28,593
number of various heights of dunes in the
distance. This city is thrown right in the center

1418
01:43:28,593 --> 01:43:32,837
of what appears to be hundreds of miles of desert
from the view that you had as the sun was

1419
01:43:32,837 --> 01:43:34,086
setting.

1420
01:43:34,086 --> 01:43:36,930
LAURA: And the gates to the city are closed at
night?

1421
01:43:36,930 --> 01:43:39,348
MATT: The gates to the city are closed from this
perspective, yes.

1422
01:43:39,348 --> 01:43:41,998
LIAM: We did it, you guys. We made it to Burning
Man.

1423
01:43:41,998 --> 01:43:46,462
MATT: You guys timed this, I didn't.

1424
01:43:46,462 --> 01:43:49,868
LAURA: Can we see guards around? Do they look
aggressive?

1425
01:43:49,868 --> 01:44:01,073
MATT: The giant iron gates stand about 65 feet
tall and about as wide from end to end. They have

1426
01:44:01,073 --> 01:44:09,910
a very tight weave of iron bars between them, to
where it's almost a very thick fencing that you

1427
01:44:09,910 --> 01:44:13,697
can almost see through. You can just see the
outline of things that walk back and forth behind

1428
01:44:13,697 --> 01:44:18,841
it. However, on the front side, you can see a
number of guards.

1429
01:44:18,841 --> 01:44:29,646
LAURA: We can see your piece of paper on the
screen. Still see it.

1430
01:44:29,646 --> 01:44:33,040
MATT: Stop looking at my piece of paper on the
screen!

1431
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:34,441
LIAM: There's a Vestige!

1432
01:44:34,441 --> 01:44:48,806
MATT: Not actually. Not anymore, it's not! It's
gone! All right. Amongst the carved-out circle of

1433
01:44:48,806 --> 01:44:52,839
caravan carts and people that are camping
overnight before entering the city, you do see

1434
01:44:52,839 --> 01:45:03,735
what appear to be a dozen guards, all dressed in
dark blue and dark reddish metallic armor, many

1435
01:45:03,735 --> 01:45:09,849
carrying heavy scimitars to their side or long
pikes and shields. They're all wearing intricate

1436
01:45:09,849 --> 01:45:14,055
helmets that crest down past the nose to the point
where it looks like they just have eyes and a

1437
01:45:14,055 --> 01:45:18,821
lower jaw. It flares out at the bottom and then
curves to a point right across where the clavicle

1438
01:45:18,821 --> 01:45:23,245
would be. The armor itself is designed in a very
beautiful ornate fashion, but also looks very

1439
01:45:23,245 --> 01:45:29,404
functional. You're at a distance; they don't seem
to have noticed you as you've all crested down

1440
01:45:29,404 --> 01:45:30,920
still in your cloud forms.

1441
01:45:30,920 --> 01:45:33,808
LAURA: We should probably land far away.

1442
01:45:33,808 --> 01:45:40,963
TALIESIN: I'm going to de-mist. There seems to be
a section where people are camping. Let's just,

1443
01:45:40,963 --> 01:45:46,566
for once, take this by the book. We want to make
sure they know we're here. No sneaking into the city.

1444
01:45:46,566 --> 01:45:49,395
MARISHA: I don't think they'd take kindly to
surprises.

1445
01:45:49,395 --> 01:45:54,631
TALIESIN: At worst, we've got the pretense of
being emissaries from Emon looking for help.

1446
01:45:54,631 --> 01:45:55,740
MARISHA: Yeah.

1447
01:45:55,740 --> 01:45:57,941
LIAM: They punish people for nicking things. I
don't think we want to try to break in.

1448
01:45:57,941 --> 01:46:02,217
TALIESIN: No. we're going to try and be truthful
as much as possible, although nobody say the W word.

1449
01:46:02,217 --> 01:46:04,527
TRAVIS: Wine?

1450
01:46:04,527 --> 01:46:06,403
LAURA: Wine, definitely wine.

1451
01:46:06,403 --> 01:46:14,341
MARISHA: I'm assuming that that's the Hand of Ord
that we're looking at.

1452
01:46:14,341 --> 01:46:16,936
SAM: The Hand of Ord is supposed to be super
secret.

1453
01:46:16,936 --> 01:46:19,850
TALIESIN: It might just be guards.

1454
01:46:19,850 --> 01:46:22,347
MATT: The Hand of Ord isn't secret.

1455
01:46:22,347 --> 01:46:24,883
MARISHA: No, he said the Hand of Ord is the name
of the peacekeeping guards.

1456
01:46:24,883 --> 01:46:26,085
TALIESIN: Yes, that's right.

1457
01:46:26,085 --> 01:46:29,643
LAURA: All right!

1458
01:46:29,643 --> 01:46:30,927
TALIESIN: Let's camp for the evening.

1459
01:46:30,927 --> 01:46:33,578
LAURA: Shall we camp in the mansion, then?

1460
01:46:33,578 --> 01:46:34,629
TALIESIN: Yes.

1461
01:46:34,629 --> 01:46:35,538
LAURA: So comfortable.

1462
01:46:35,538 --> 01:46:37,293
SAM: Sure.

1463
01:46:37,293 --> 01:46:41,466
LIAM: We're still a distance though? Where we are,
from the guards?

1464
01:46:41,466 --> 01:46:43,279
LAURA: Yeah. We're off a little bit.

1465
01:46:43,279 --> 01:46:46,787
MATT: How far are you guys? How far did you decide
to stop and transform? That's up to you.

1466
01:46:46,787 --> 01:46:47,771
LIAM: I don't know.

1467
01:46:47,771 --> 01:46:51,598
TALIESIN: Where were the other people camping for
the night?

1468
01:46:51,598 --> 01:46:55,225
MATT: They're maybe 40 feet from the gates.

1469
01:46:55,225 --> 01:46:57,431
TALIESIN: Well, let's camp 40 feet. Let's camp
with them.

1470
01:46:57,431 --> 01:47:00,162
TRAVIS: You want to put a magical door 40 feet?

1471
01:47:00,162 --> 01:47:05,428
TALIESIN: I'm perfectly okay. It's not like they
can come in. No one can enter who can't be

1472
01:47:05,428 --> 01:47:06,365
invited.

1473
01:47:06,365 --> 01:47:08,756
LIAM: You want to make a mystical door floating in
the middle of their tents?

1474
01:47:08,756 --> 01:47:10,891
LAURA: Do the people seem friendly? Do they seem
tired?

1475
01:47:10,891 --> 01:47:12,891
TALIESIN: We're going to camp next to their
campsite.

1476
01:47:12,891 --> 01:47:14,153
MATT: Make a perception check

1477
01:47:14,153 --> 01:47:19,073
LIAM: In this world, on the ground? I love it. We
haven't done it that much lately.

1478
01:47:19,073 --> 01:47:21,578
TALIESIN: We've been too used to being careful.

1479
01:47:21,578 --> 01:47:25,153
MARISHA: In the mansion.

1480
01:47:25,153 --> 01:47:27,150
LAURA: 22.

1481
01:47:27,150 --> 01:47:29,220
MARISHA: So not really camping. We're glamping.

1482
01:47:29,220 --> 01:47:35,131
MATT: At a safe distance, you can make out some
detail, and there is some lantern light on top of

1483
01:47:35,131 --> 01:47:39,740
some of these carts. It appears that a number of
the folks have set up small tents, and most appear

1484
01:47:39,740 --> 01:47:46,407
to be sleeping. There are a few guards that are
set on top of the carts with crossbows resting

1485
01:47:46,407 --> 01:47:50,264
over their lap, keeping an eye in case anyone
decides to get too close to their wares throughout

1486
01:47:50,264 --> 01:47:51,155
the evening.

1487
01:47:51,155 --> 01:47:52,573
LAURA: How about we keep a distance?

1488
01:47:52,573 --> 01:47:55,082
MARISHA: Yeah, let's not mist down in the middle
of a group.

1489
01:47:55,082 --> 01:47:59,084
LAURA: No, let's keep a distance from them and be
another group of people coming into the city.

1490
01:47:59,084 --> 01:48:00,939
TRAVIS: I'd say 200 yards out.

1491
01:48:00,939 --> 01:48:02,944
LIAM: Percival said he already un-misted.

1492
01:48:02,944 --> 01:48:06,407
MARISHA: We're deciding how far. So 200 yards.

1493
01:48:06,407 --> 01:48:07,517
TALIESIN: I can re-mist.

1494
01:48:07,517 --> 01:48:09,283
LIAM: We can all do that?

1495
01:48:09,283 --> 01:48:12,675
TALIESIN: As long as the eight hours hasn't
passed, we can go in and out as you please, isn't

1496
01:48:12,675 --> 01:48:13,689
that correct?

1497
01:48:13,689 --> 01:48:15,456
MATT: Yeah. It takes you a minute to transform.

1498
01:48:15,456 --> 01:48:22,273
SAM: Should we use our misting while we have it
and mist into the city?

1499
01:48:22,273 --> 01:48:26,056
TRAVIS: That's what I said, but they punish crime
so harshly.

1500
01:48:26,056 --> 01:48:28,179
SAM: We haven't committed any crime.

1501
01:48:28,179 --> 01:48:31,193
LAURA: No, but they have to document who goes in
and out.

1502
01:48:31,193 --> 01:48:32,480
SAM: They won't even know--

1503
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:35,084
LIAM: Scan-man, let's start by playing nice,
please.

1504
01:48:35,084 --> 01:48:39,626
MARISHA: And if we get caught, they're going to
know we didn't sign in correctly.

1505
01:48:39,626 --> 01:48:42,761
TALIESIN: They have giant spires, yeah, and
they're going to say "who are you?" and we're not

1506
01:48:42,761 --> 01:48:43,933
going to be on the list.

1507
01:48:43,933 --> 01:48:47,461
LIAM: We know nothing about these people or the
customs here.

1508
01:48:47,461 --> 01:48:50,932
TRAVIS: Yeah, we've got to learn a little bit
before we kill all of them.

1509
01:48:50,932 --> 01:48:56,182
MARISHA: I don't see any trees, and those guards
look heavily funded. That looks like expensive

1510
01:48:56,182 --> 01:48:57,788
armor they're all wearing.

1511
01:48:57,788 --> 01:48:59,582
TALIESIN: You've got a good eye, yes.

1512
01:48:59,582 --> 01:49:00,824
LAURA: Can we have the mansion, Scanlan?

1513
01:49:00,824 --> 01:49:02,413
SAM: Sure, yes, we can do the mansion.

1514
01:49:02,413 --> 01:49:06,655
TALIESIN: Get close enough to the other group that
they are aware that we exist, but they couldn't

1515
01:49:06,655 --> 01:49:10,933
quite make us out, so just another group of
travelers camping for the night.

1516
01:49:10,933 --> 01:49:13,012
LIAM: With a door floating in the air.

1517
01:49:13,012 --> 01:49:15,437
TALIESIN: It's magic. It's not like they've never
seen it before.

1518
01:49:15,437 --> 01:49:25,952
MATT: The light radius beyond the wall itself is
not very strong. It only low-lights maybe a 30- to

1519
01:49:25,952 --> 01:49:29,157
40-foot area around the gate itself, and there are
a series of small torches that appear to be

1520
01:49:29,157 --> 01:49:33,415
ever-burning on the outside of the wall. There are
a few campfires that have been set up by the

1521
01:49:33,415 --> 01:49:38,081
caravans that are waiting amongst the sand and
broken ground there. They give a little more

1522
01:49:38,081 --> 01:49:42,798
light. As you guys get to the outskirts of this,
your shapes becoming visible to those that are

1523
01:49:42,798 --> 01:49:47,154
keeping watch, you see a few individuals stand up
on their carts with their crossbows at the ready.

1524
01:49:47,154 --> 01:49:54,689
Just have a seat and keep an eye bead on those of
you that are visible. Doesn't appear to be any

1525
01:49:54,689 --> 01:49:58,378
aggressive action, just an acknowledgement of your
presence and a show of readiness should any

1526
01:49:58,378 --> 01:49:59,757
aggressive action be taken.

1527
01:49:59,757 --> 01:50:02,569
LIAM: I'm going to not say anything but do the "be
pleased" motion.

1528
01:50:02,569 --> 01:50:04,004
LAURA: He already did that.

1529
01:50:04,004 --> 01:50:05,338
LIAM: Well, I'm doing it, as well.

1530
01:50:05,338 --> 01:50:07,286
LAURA: I'm going to watch you do it.

1531
01:50:07,286 --> 01:50:11,539
SAM: So we've un-misted. Are we going to mansion
and go to sleep?

1532
01:50:11,539 --> 01:50:15,042
TALIESIN: We're going to mansion. It's 2:00am.
It's time to mansion and go to sleep.

1533
01:50:15,042 --> 01:50:18,188
SAM: All right. We'll do that.

1534
01:50:18,188 --> 01:50:25,093
MARISHA: Okay, the people who are camping, what do
they look like? Pretty common folk, I'm assuming?

1535
01:50:25,093 --> 01:50:28,556
MATT: Best you tell at this distance, the few that
you can see-- because a lot of them appear to be

1536
01:50:28,556 --> 01:50:38,120
in small tents encamped-- the few that you do make
out appear to be dressed in a little more wealthy

1537
01:50:38,120 --> 01:50:44,823
attire than the people you encountered in Shandal.
You can see the gentlemen and ladies that are

1538
01:50:44,823 --> 01:50:54,599
guarding the encampment are dressed in functional
leathers with hints of hide and metal plates

1539
01:50:54,599 --> 01:51:04,309
incorporated in the defense, but nothing that
shows overt wealth or overt destitution. General

1540
01:51:04,309 --> 01:51:07,210
mercenary guardians for a traveling caravan.

1541
01:51:07,210 --> 01:51:13,299
MARISHA: Okay. Are we going to talk to any of
them?

1542
01:51:13,299 --> 01:51:19,484
TALIESIN: Unless there's a brazenly loud group
around one of the campfires.

1543
01:51:19,484 --> 01:51:25,828
MATT: At this hour? No. You get the sense, looking
at the surroundings of the campfires, it looks

1544
01:51:25,828 --> 01:51:30,223
like some sort of party or gathering may have
transpired earlier in the evening, but most

1545
01:51:30,223 --> 01:51:31,943
everyone have passed out at this time.

1546
01:51:31,943 --> 01:51:34,907
LAURA: The guards are guarding. Anybody that
approaches is a threat.

1547
01:51:34,907 --> 01:51:37,096
SAM: Yeah, we'll just go to sleep.

1548
01:51:37,096 --> 01:51:39,913
TALIESIN: Goodnight, all. I am ready for bed.

1549
01:51:39,913 --> 01:51:41,005
MATT: Scanlan?

1550
01:51:41,005 --> 01:51:42,441
SAM: I will make the mansion.

1551
01:51:42,441 --> 01:51:48,072
MATT: The doorway glows with a faint purple hue.
In the distance, you see some of the guards step

1552
01:51:48,072 --> 01:51:52,520
forward and keep an eye out there. Attention has
been gained by the doorway, but none of them are

1553
01:51:52,520 --> 01:51:59,779
approaching immediately. You guys begin to step
into the doorway one by one as three of the guards

1554
01:51:59,779 --> 01:52:02,262
begin to slowly walk towards the doorway.

1555
01:52:02,262 --> 01:52:04,952
TALIESIN: I'll go last. It'll be fine.

1556
01:52:04,952 --> 01:52:06,867
MARISHA: I go in.

1557
01:52:06,867 --> 01:52:11,959
LIAM: Scanlan, why don't you hang with Percival? I
go in.

1558
01:52:11,959 --> 01:52:15,192
TRAVIS: Yeah, in.

1559
01:52:15,192 --> 01:52:17,408
LAURA: I stand in the doorway.

1560
01:52:17,408 --> 01:52:19,349
SAM: We going to talk to these people?

1561
01:52:19,349 --> 01:52:22,894
TALIESIN: We're going to let them know who we are
and what we're doing. This is just that we have a

1562
01:52:22,894 --> 01:52:24,347
very expensive tent.

1563
01:52:24,347 --> 01:52:25,560
SAM: Great.

1564
01:52:25,560 --> 01:52:32,249
MATT: So with that, Percival, Scanlan, and Vex
wait outside the shimmering doorway to Scanlan's

1565
01:52:32,249 --> 01:52:42,009
magnificent mansion. You see the guards begin to
approach. The one at the front, a square-jawed,

1566
01:52:42,009 --> 01:52:50,125
intense-looking man who looks to be not enjoying
his current time schedule as a guard on the

1567
01:52:50,125 --> 01:52:57,464
outside of the southern gates of Ank'Harel
approaches, hand at the side clutching some sort

1568
01:52:57,464 --> 01:53:04,402
of weapon that he has currently sheathed. "May I
ask the business of this strange conjuration

1569
01:53:04,402 --> 01:53:06,717
"you've brought at this hour of the night?"

1570
01:53:06,717 --> 01:53:09,159
TALIESIN: It is our very expensive tent.

1571
01:53:09,159 --> 01:53:13,253
SAM, TALIESIN, and LAURA: Be pleased.

1572
01:53:13,253 --> 01:53:15,658
MATT: Make a persuasion check, Percy.

1573
01:53:15,658 --> 01:53:37,319
TALIESIN: That'll do. 23. Yeah, 24 actually. 24!

1574
01:53:37,319 --> 01:53:43,461
MATT: "I do not know of the nature of this magic
that you bring, but I recommend that you keep it

1575
01:53:43,461 --> 01:53:44,824
"outside of the city."

1576
01:53:44,824 --> 01:53:46,114
TALIESIN: Oh, yes, of course.

1577
01:53:46,114 --> 01:53:49,302
LAURA: Wait, is magic not allowed within the
city?

1578
01:53:49,302 --> 01:53:55,609
MATT: "Oh, magic is allowed, but this is unknown
to us, and unknown magic is a dangerous magic."

1579
01:53:55,609 --> 01:54:02,294
TALIESIN: I thank you for your advice. We will
heed it well. What is your name, sir?

1580
01:54:02,294 --> 01:54:07,511
MATT: "It does not matter. We have 12 crossbows
trained on this doorway, and will for the

1581
01:54:07,511 --> 01:54:12,991
"remainder of the evening. Should anything strange
happen, we will not hesitate but to fire."

1582
01:54:12,991 --> 01:54:15,832
TALIESIN: The strangest thing you will see this
evening will be us.

1583
01:54:15,832 --> 01:54:17,222
MATT: "Good."

1584
01:54:17,222 --> 01:54:20,824
LAURA: Thank you for the warning.

1585
01:54:20,824 --> 01:54:23,951
MATT: Turns around and walks back to the gate.

1586
01:54:23,951 --> 01:54:27,099
TALIESIN: That could not have gone better.

1587
01:54:27,099 --> 01:54:28,916
TRAVIS: (singing) We've got to kill everybody.

1588
01:54:28,916 --> 01:54:30,757
(laughter)

1589
01:54:30,757 --> 01:54:35,361
LAURA: Magic is allowed, but this is strange
magic. How will we know what isn't strange magic?

1590
01:54:35,361 --> 01:54:42,260
TALIESIN: Everything we can do is strange magic.
Be prepared that not being from around here is

1591
01:54:42,260 --> 01:54:43,723
going to be trouble.

1592
01:54:43,723 --> 01:54:45,517
MARISHA: Yeah, I think we're just strange.

1593
01:54:45,517 --> 01:54:47,862
LAURA: I hold the door open.

1594
01:54:47,862 --> 01:54:51,010
LIAM: We've had old magic, new magic, strange
magic.

1595
01:54:51,010 --> 01:54:53,767
MATT: This is all the new schools of magic.

1596
01:54:53,767 --> 01:54:56,011
SAM: We go in.

1597
01:54:56,011 --> 01:55:00,538
MATT: You guys go in. Mansion's prepared, servants
are at your ready, beds are freshly fluffed.

1598
01:55:00,538 --> 01:55:05,006
Damaged kitchens are rearranged to have been not
touched at all.

1599
01:55:05,006 --> 01:55:06,025
TRAVIS: What?!

1600
01:55:06,025 --> 01:55:08,054
LAURA: Wonderful.

1601
01:55:08,054 --> 01:55:09,933
SAM: I love it.

1602
01:55:09,933 --> 01:55:16,147
MATT: You are able to rest for the evening as you
prepare for your next day entering the city of

1603
01:55:16,147 --> 01:55:17,367
Ank'Harel itself.

1604
01:55:17,367 --> 01:55:23,245
TALIESIN: I make my way, quietly in the night, to
Grog's room. I was just kidding, sorry!

1605
01:55:23,245 --> 01:55:26,460
TRAVIS: (laughing) I was like, "come get some,
bitch!"

1606
01:55:26,460 --> 01:55:31,803
LAURA: No, I want to go to sleep, and I'm holding
on to Fenthras and thinking about everything.

1607
01:55:31,803 --> 01:55:37,985
MATT: Mulling over the events that recently
transpired and digesting all the questions you

1608
01:55:37,985 --> 01:55:39,547
still have.

1609
01:55:39,547 --> 01:55:44,742
TALIESIN: I gave you a lot to think about, didn't
I? Sorry. (laughs)

1610
01:55:44,742 --> 01:55:47,023
SAM: I play a card game by myself.

1611
01:55:47,023 --> 01:55:51,089
MATT: Okay. As you guys have a restful night,
we're going to take a break. We'll be back here in

1612
01:55:51,089 --> 01:55:56,035
a few minutes, and we'll pick this up in the
following morning as they enter the city itself.

1613
01:55:56,035 --> 01:55:57,818
See you in a minute!

1614
01:55:57,818 --> 01:59:39,808
[break]

1615
01:59:39,883 --> 01:59:44,489
MATT: Welcome back, everyone! Returning from the
break, Vox Machina has an evening of rest in

1616
01:59:44,489 --> 01:59:50,306
Scanlan's magnificent mansion. You come to
consciousness the following morning, stationed

1617
01:59:50,306 --> 01:59:55,297
within the beautiful confines of this magical
mansion, unaware directly of what awaits you on

1618
01:59:55,297 --> 01:59:57,916
the other side of the doorway. However, the
morning is yours. What do you wish to do?

1619
01:59:57,916 --> 01:59:59,989
LIAM: I'm going to stealth back to my room.

1620
01:59:59,989 --> 02:00:01,772
MATT: Okay. (laughs)

1621
02:00:01,772 --> 02:00:03,108
LAURA: Oh.

1622
02:00:03,108 --> 02:00:05,542
MARISHA: No one sees anything.

1623
02:00:05,542 --> 02:00:07,167
MATT: Make a stealth check.

1624
02:00:07,167 --> 02:00:12,153
LIAM: No worries. I got a one, but I'll use luck.

1625
02:00:12,153 --> 02:00:13,849
MARISHA: You're using a luck?

1626
02:00:13,849 --> 02:00:15,459
LIAM: Two ones!

1627
02:00:15,459 --> 02:00:16,788
TALIESIN: Two ones!

1628
02:00:16,788 --> 02:00:21,042
ALL: (yelling) Yes!

1629
02:00:21,042 --> 02:00:23,198
TALIESIN: There is a god, and he hates you!

1630
02:00:23,198 --> 02:00:25,600
MARISHA: You are so walk of shaming right now.

1631
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:27,388
(laughter)

1632
02:00:27,388 --> 02:00:32,884
MATT: So as the morning comes about, Vex, you go
stretch out of your room, scratching the side of

1633
02:00:32,884 --> 02:00:38,296
your head, messed up from sleeping wrong on the
pillow, and as you walk out you hear (clicking)

1634
02:00:38,296 --> 02:00:43,434
and look to your right and see your brother
slowly slinking away from Keyleth's room.

1635
02:00:43,434 --> 02:00:50,020
LAURA: (retching) I go back in my room.

1636
02:00:50,020 --> 02:00:52,750
LIAM: Oh hey, hold on a second, though.

1637
02:00:52,750 --> 02:00:56,166
TRAVIS: Oh man. (laughs) Talk it out.

1638
02:00:56,166 --> 02:01:00,218
MARISHA: Talk it out right now.

1639
02:01:00,218 --> 02:01:02,939
LAURA: I'm about to throw up.

1640
02:01:02,939 --> 02:01:07,046
LIAM: No, you make jokes, but I want to go into
your room for a second and talk to you.

1641
02:01:07,046 --> 02:01:09,430
TRAVIS: Ew! Make him bathe.

1642
02:01:09,430 --> 02:01:14,685
LAURA: Fine. And I go in my room and I sit down on
the opposite side of the room.

1643
02:01:14,685 --> 02:01:19,809
LIAM: Take a full minute to get over it, you
fucker.

1644
02:01:19,809 --> 02:01:26,246
LAURA: Hold on, it's not been a minute. All
right.

1645
02:01:26,246 --> 02:01:31,379
LIAM: You really should have gone into acting. It
really was your calling. Yeah.

1646
02:01:31,379 --> 02:01:36,478
LAURA: No, I'm happy for you. As foul as it is.
What are you doing? What?

1647
02:01:36,478 --> 02:01:44,130
LIAM: (sighs) Sorry, I'm a little discombobulated.
I've never rolled two ones in a row.

1648
02:01:44,130 --> 02:01:46,219
MATT: Yeah, that happened.

1649
02:01:46,219 --> 02:01:48,116
LAURA: Oh, that was so amazing.

1650
02:01:48,116 --> 02:01:49,521
MATT: Take that, Luck feat!

1651
02:01:49,521 --> 02:01:52,329
(laughter)

1652
02:01:52,329 --> 02:02:00,122
LIAM: I know this is a really stupid time to talk
about it, but we never get to talk to each other,

1653
02:02:00,122 --> 02:02:10,794
and I have a serious question. (nervous laugh)
Relax. In that tree, that guy said a lot of

1654
02:02:10,794 --> 02:02:14,904
fucked-up shit to you, and it just sounded like a
lot of fucked-up shit and him trying to make you

1655
02:02:14,904 --> 02:02:26,516
feel bad, so fuck him, right? Fuck that guy. But
he said something about a dagger? And I saw your

1656
02:02:26,516 --> 02:02:28,071
face fall.

1657
02:02:28,071 --> 02:02:31,880
LAURA: (soft laugh) Jesus Christ.

1658
02:02:31,880 --> 02:02:36,969
LIAM: And I asked you if you were all right the
other day, and I think you might have not told me

1659
02:02:36,969 --> 02:02:41,613
the entire truth. Are you all right?

1660
02:02:41,613 --> 02:02:44,152
LAURA: Really?

1661
02:02:44,152 --> 02:02:45,563
LIAM: Yeah.

1662
02:02:45,563 --> 02:02:46,841
LAURA: Right now?

1663
02:02:46,841 --> 02:02:51,449
LIAM: I could be dead tomorrow, Vex. Right now.

1664
02:02:51,449 --> 02:03:03,787
LAURA: He knew a lot of things, yes. I don't think
he was completely wrong, and that's what makes me

1665
02:03:03,787 --> 02:03:06,461
feel terrible.

1666
02:03:06,461 --> 02:03:11,160
LIAM: About what, about you being shitty? Fuck
that guy!

1667
02:03:11,160 --> 02:03:14,637
LAURA: Well, he was right about the dagger.

1668
02:03:14,637 --> 02:03:26,014
LIAM: I want you to tell me about the dagger. I
want to know about the dagger, but I'm serious,

1669
02:03:26,014 --> 02:03:31,635
fuck that guy on the rotten branches he was
growing out of. He's not right. Your strength of

1670
02:03:31,635 --> 02:03:43,029
character runs deep. Fuck that guy! It breaks my
heart to see you doubt yourself. You have always

1671
02:03:43,029 --> 02:03:52,480
been a wonderful woman! I'm not saying you have to
be a fucking beefcake; you don't have to be a

1672
02:03:52,480 --> 02:03:53,752
soldier, but--

1673
02:03:53,752 --> 02:03:57,318
LAURA: That's good, because I am really weak.
(laughs)

1674
02:03:57,318 --> 02:04:06,107
LIAM: Whatever the case, you are a good person.
All of them know that. They all know that. None of

1675
02:04:06,107 --> 02:04:15,491
them doubt it. I don't doubt it. I don't have the
words, I just want you to believe me.

1676
02:04:15,491 --> 02:04:19,273
LAURA: Thank you.

1677
02:04:19,273 --> 02:04:27,355
LIAM: I'm not eloquent like Percival, but I've
known you a long time. You are a good person.

1678
02:04:27,355 --> 02:04:37,304
LAURA: Thank you. It makes me happy to see you
happy.

1679
02:04:37,304 --> 02:04:41,063
LIAM: Forgot what it feels like.

1680
02:04:41,063 --> 02:04:42,391
LAURA: Yeah, right?

1681
02:04:42,391 --> 02:04:46,829
LIAM: What's the dagger?

1682
02:04:46,829 --> 02:04:53,610
LAURA: Oh, that. Yeah, I killed a couple people
and I saved Trinket, that's all.

1683
02:04:53,610 --> 02:04:55,768
LIAM: When?

1684
02:04:55,768 --> 02:04:59,860
MATT: Trinket comes waking up from what was his
sleeping stance.

1685
02:04:59,860 --> 02:05:03,107
LIAM: You'll have to be more specific than that.

1686
02:05:03,107 --> 02:05:06,308
LAURA: Do you remember when I brought Trinket back
to camp?

1687
02:05:06,308 --> 02:05:12,446
LIAM: Originally?

1688
02:05:12,446 --> 02:05:14,729
LAURA: Yeah! All those years ago?

1689
02:05:14,729 --> 02:05:17,210
LIAM: Yes! I thought it was a terrible idea. I was
dead wrong.

1690
02:05:17,210 --> 02:05:30,081
LAURA: (laughs) Well... turns out, I found him in
a camp where I'd been taken.

1691
02:05:30,081 --> 02:05:32,722
LIAM: What?

1692
02:05:32,722 --> 02:05:42,882
LAURA: Yes, and there was some really dark people
there, and they had harvested--

1693
02:05:42,882 --> 02:05:44,192
SAM: (sneezes)

1694
02:05:44,192 --> 02:05:50,083
LAURA: Trinket's mother. Bless you. Is Scanlan in
the room?

1695
02:05:50,083 --> 02:05:54,889
LIAM: The paintings do all have holes cut in the
eyes, so you can never be sure.

1696
02:05:54,889 --> 02:06:06,658
LAURA: I did what I had to do, and I killed them.

1697
02:06:06,658 --> 02:06:12,206
LIAM: The people that took you.

1698
02:06:12,206 --> 02:06:15,311
LAURA: Yes. I did.

1699
02:06:15,311 --> 02:06:17,664
LIAM: The people that took you from me?

1700
02:06:17,664 --> 02:06:27,033
LAURA: Yes. And I saved Trinket that night, and
that's what Saundor saw. More than anything I

1701
02:06:27,033 --> 02:06:30,254
just... I don't know how he saw it.

1702
02:06:30,254 --> 02:06:42,310
LIAM: Are you just creeped out because he knew or
because of what happened? Why are you upset?

1703
02:06:42,310 --> 02:06:43,791
LAURA: I'm not.

1704
02:06:43,791 --> 02:06:55,777
LIAM: Well, listen. I wasn't there. I don't know
what happened, but... you came back to me, so

1705
02:06:55,777 --> 02:06:57,996
whatever happened can't be wrong.

1706
02:06:57,996 --> 02:06:59,650
LAURA: Right? (sniffles)

1707
02:06:59,650 --> 02:07:15,969
LIAM: Oh, come here! Come here! If somebody took
you from me... I don't know how to see it any

1708
02:07:15,969 --> 02:07:19,979
other way than I do. You would have to do
something really terrible, Vex'ahlia, for me to

1709
02:07:19,979 --> 02:07:25,607
ever feel disappointment in you, and you have not
ringed that bell. Rung it?

1710
02:07:25,607 --> 02:07:26,805
LAURA: Rung it.

1711
02:07:26,805 --> 02:07:28,795
LIAM: You studied harder than I did.

1712
02:07:28,795 --> 02:07:30,624
LAURA: (laughs)

1713
02:07:30,624 --> 02:07:46,987
LIAM: Goodness, please. One more time: You are a
good person, and I've always seen that. Please see

1714
02:07:46,987 --> 02:07:54,454
it, please. Oh god, my heart is breaking.

1715
02:07:54,454 --> 02:08:08,674
LAURA: No! It's good. We all need to self-reflect
every once in a while. I needed it. My heart is in

1716
02:08:08,674 --> 02:08:20,882
the right place. I know it is. I'm just afraid
sometimes actions speak louder than intentions. If

1717
02:08:20,882 --> 02:08:30,799
things I was doing could be read the wrong way,
then... maybe I need to change what I do.

1718
02:08:30,799 --> 02:08:37,955
LIAM: (sighs) You've always been bold. That's not
a crime. That's all right.

1719
02:08:37,955 --> 02:08:45,358
LAURA: It's fine, dear.

1720
02:08:45,358 --> 02:08:48,507
LIAM: I feel like a boy again.

1721
02:08:48,507 --> 02:08:58,869
LAURA: (laughs) No, please. I'm so happy to see
you happy. Don't worry about me. I'm fine!

1722
02:08:58,869 --> 02:09:00,396
LIAM: Well, no, but--

1723
02:09:00,396 --> 02:09:03,607
LAURA: And I can talk to Trinket now. We talk all
the time.

1724
02:09:03,607 --> 02:09:04,733
LIAM: Vex'ahlia.

1725
02:09:04,733 --> 02:09:05,947
LAURA: We've talked through a lot.

1726
02:09:05,947 --> 02:09:07,096
LIAM: Vex.

1727
02:09:07,096 --> 02:09:08,054
LAURA: Right?

1728
02:09:08,054 --> 02:09:08,947
LIAM: Vex.

1729
02:09:08,947 --> 02:09:10,797
LAURA: Yes? (laughs)

1730
02:09:10,797 --> 02:09:16,159
LIAM: Fuck, I'm just going around-- I love you.

1731
02:09:16,159 --> 02:09:17,369
LAURA: I love you.

1732
02:09:17,369 --> 02:09:22,443
LIAM: You don't have to talk to me about
everything, but if you want to... if you want to.

1733
02:09:22,443 --> 02:09:24,839
Should you need me.

1734
02:09:24,839 --> 02:09:26,423
LAURA: "Should you need me."

1735
02:09:26,423 --> 02:09:31,198
LIAM: All right. Sorry to babble.

1736
02:09:31,198 --> 02:09:34,742
LAURA: Oh, yeah, no. Maybe go take a shower.

1737
02:09:34,742 --> 02:09:41,410
LIAM: I'm not going to answer that. I'll see you
at breakfast. And I walk away.

1738
02:09:41,410 --> 02:09:50,194
MATT: Yeah, you do. All right, as you all find
breakfast, a fair prepared chicken feast, as

1739
02:09:50,194 --> 02:09:51,854
they've been given no other instruction.

1740
02:09:51,854 --> 02:09:54,304
(laughter)

1741
02:09:54,304 --> 02:09:56,236
TRAVIS: Can't we change it up?

1742
02:09:56,236 --> 02:09:58,398
LIAM: I'm afraid not.

1743
02:09:58,398 --> 02:09:59,998
SAM: Change up the food?

1744
02:09:59,998 --> 02:10:01,871
LAURA: Yeah, maybe something other than chicken.

1745
02:10:01,871 --> 02:10:05,751
SAM: Why? It's nutritious. It's delicious.

1746
02:10:05,751 --> 02:10:07,168
TRAVIS: Ravioli!

1747
02:10:07,168 --> 02:10:09,696
SAM: Ravioli for breakfast? All right.

1748
02:10:09,696 --> 02:10:11,528
LAURA: Something with veggies?

1749
02:10:11,528 --> 02:10:15,256
SAM: Let's do ravioli. Staff?

1750
02:10:15,256 --> 02:10:17,156
MATT: "Yes, Scanlan?"

1751
02:10:17,156 --> 02:10:18,851
LAURA: Oh, they speak?

1752
02:10:18,851 --> 02:10:21,190
TRAVIS: Shit, they do talk!

1753
02:10:21,190 --> 02:10:26,467
SAM: Could you make us some chicken ravioli?

1754
02:10:26,467 --> 02:10:30,388
LIAM: You unlocked "Ravioli in Marquet!"

1755
02:10:30,388 --> 02:10:31,861
LAURA: They're learning.

1756
02:10:31,861 --> 02:10:34,811
TRAVIS: They're smart. We have to kill them all!

1757
02:10:34,811 --> 02:10:36,998
TALIESIN: They're going to learn.

1758
02:10:36,998 --> 02:10:42,497
MATT: The servants vanish for about ten minutes
and return with a robust meal of bowls and bowls

1759
02:10:42,497 --> 02:10:44,303
of chicken ravioli.

1760
02:10:44,303 --> 02:10:47,597
TRAVIS: Chicken ravioli. (laughs)

1761
02:10:47,597 --> 02:10:48,841
LAURA: Delicious.

1762
02:10:48,841 --> 02:10:50,387
SAM: Yummy.

1763
02:10:50,387 --> 02:10:51,677
TRAVIS: Good call.

1764
02:10:51,677 --> 02:10:53,199
TALIESIN: Adequate.

1765
02:10:53,199 --> 02:11:01,109
MATT: Slightly. You finish your meal, feel
yourself satiated as much as you can be with

1766
02:11:01,109 --> 02:11:10,898
chicken ravioli for breakfast. You guys exit, find
yourself on the exterior walls of Ank'Harel, the

1767
02:11:10,898 --> 02:11:14,961
sun blazing down in the early morning, a hotter
temperature than you've been used to in quite some

1768
02:11:14,961 --> 02:11:22,094
time. Would be the equivalent of probably the low
100s Fahrenheit by our standards. All of you with

1769
02:11:22,094 --> 02:11:28,431
layers of armor, which is all of you except for
Grog, immediately feel this is going to be

1770
02:11:28,431 --> 02:11:33,101
uncomfortable fairly quickly. Grog, you are used
to higher colder climates, even without being

1771
02:11:33,101 --> 02:11:35,405
heavily armored, still fairly uncomfortable.

1772
02:11:35,405 --> 02:11:36,492
TRAVIS: Sucks.

1773
02:11:36,492 --> 02:11:37,906
LIAM: You're really pale, too.

1774
02:11:37,906 --> 02:11:43,804
MATT: It's not great. You can see the caravans
that you guys were camping loosely next to are no

1775
02:11:43,804 --> 02:11:47,484
longer there. It looks like there have been a
couple of dark spots in the dust and the sand that

1776
02:11:47,484 --> 02:11:53,145
have been kicked over where the campsites were,
where the fires were put out, and tracks of where

1777
02:11:53,145 --> 02:11:57,411
the carts and wheels have been dragged to and
through the gate. You can now see about ten guards

1778
02:11:57,411 --> 02:12:01,798
that are all stationed at the front of that iron
gate on this side of the Ank'Harel wall.

1779
02:12:01,798 --> 02:12:10,542
SAM: Well? Should we go in and be traveling people
and kill everyone that we see?

1780
02:12:10,542 --> 02:12:12,893
TRAVIS: How about you let me take the lead on
this?

1781
02:12:12,893 --> 02:12:14,229
LAURA: How about no?

1782
02:12:14,229 --> 02:12:19,498
SAM: What's our angle? We are weary travelers from
Tal'Dorei, seeking--

1783
02:12:19,498 --> 02:12:24,920
MARISHA: I thought we were going into this one
with honesty. Thought we agreed to that.

1784
02:12:24,920 --> 02:12:26,363
SAM: Seeking help?

1785
02:12:26,363 --> 02:12:28,741
MARISHA: We're ambassadors from Emon.

1786
02:12:28,741 --> 02:12:36,104
TRAVIS: Keyleth, do you really want to be honest
or is it a ploy? Do we want to be honest?

1787
02:12:36,104 --> 02:12:38,359
TALIESIN: The ploy is to be honest.

1788
02:12:38,359 --> 02:12:46,184
MARISHA: Our normality is dishonesty, so
technically we're switching it up.

1789
02:12:46,184 --> 02:12:47,476
LAURA: This is the ploy.

1790
02:12:47,476 --> 02:12:49,147
TALIESIN: This is a radical shift.

1791
02:12:49,147 --> 02:12:51,814
MARISHA: We're not honest, so let's try it for
once.

1792
02:12:51,814 --> 02:12:55,795
SAM: All right, let's do it. We're from Emon, we
need help fighting dragons.

1793
02:12:55,795 --> 02:12:58,093
MARISHA: I feel like that's pretty compelling.

1794
02:12:58,093 --> 02:13:00,136
MATT: Grog, make an intelligence check.

1795
02:13:00,136 --> 02:13:07,140
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yeah, thank you. Travis needs to
make an intelligence check. Oh Jesus, it's a 12.

1796
02:13:07,140 --> 02:13:08,811
Minus two.

1797
02:13:08,811 --> 02:13:15,095
MATT: You have no idea what they're talking about.
You find yourself instinctually nodding.

1798
02:13:15,095 --> 02:13:18,666
SAM: We'll just go in, big guy. We'll be fine.

1799
02:13:18,666 --> 02:13:23,936
LIAM: First chance for violence is all yours.
You're the first one in.

1800
02:13:23,936 --> 02:13:29,363
TRAVIS: I'm all in. Violence. That's what I came
away with.

1801
02:13:29,363 --> 02:13:32,037
MARISHA: (sighs) We have to be careful with our
word choices with him.

1802
02:13:32,037 --> 02:13:35,499
TALIESIN: We head towards the gate.

1803
02:13:35,499 --> 02:13:41,329
TRAVIS: (garbled) This ravioli is delicious, by
the way. My compliments to the little purple men.

1804
02:13:41,329 --> 02:13:43,324
SAM: They're not men, but yes.

1805
02:13:43,324 --> 02:13:51,811
MATT: As you guys approach the outside of the
gate, you can see seven of the guards stay behind

1806
02:13:51,811 --> 02:13:57,040
while three, seemingly the same three that had
been keeping a close eye upon your initial

1807
02:13:57,040 --> 02:14:02,643
approach in the evening, walk up. The same man
walks up, now looking a little tired; his day is

1808
02:14:02,643 --> 02:14:08,341
probably finishing out the rest of his station
here at the gate. Approaches, hand still on the

1809
02:14:08,341 --> 02:14:16,878
side of his sheathed weapon. "So you awaken. You
have rested. What is your business here in

1810
02:14:16,878 --> 02:14:18,466
"Ank'Harel?"

1811
02:14:18,466 --> 02:14:27,736
SAM: We are weary travelers from Emon, and we have
come to seek assistance with the security of our home.

1812
02:14:27,736 --> 02:14:32,656
MATT: "What is your contact within the city? Who
do you wish to speak to?"

1813
02:14:32,656 --> 02:14:36,197
LIAM: Go for the top?

1814
02:14:36,197 --> 02:14:41,481
MARISHA: Oh, that's a really far stretch. The
king.

1815
02:14:41,481 --> 02:14:47,523
SAM: We are seeking a man called...

1816
02:14:47,523 --> 02:14:50,337
LIAM: J'mon Sa Ord.

1817
02:14:50,337 --> 02:14:55,521
SAM: No, I don't think we want to talk to the
king. Do we?

1818
02:14:55,521 --> 02:15:00,947
MARISHA: Merchant warrior? No, not that one? Who
the fuck are we trying to see?

1819
02:15:00,947 --> 02:15:08,440
SAM: We would like to talk to J'mon Sa Ord or his
or her advisors to seek advice.

1820
02:15:08,440 --> 02:15:11,401
MATT: "You come for an audience with the
emperor?"

1821
02:15:11,401 --> 02:15:14,743
TALIESIN: We come for an audience with many
people, to be honest. We are looking at many

1822
02:15:14,743 --> 02:15:20,534
avenues of possible help. Contacts, trade,
anything that can help us in our time of dire need.

1823
02:15:20,534 --> 02:15:22,643
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

1824
02:15:22,643 --> 02:15:23,910
SAM: Me or him?

1825
02:15:23,910 --> 02:15:25,227
MATT: You.

1826
02:15:25,227 --> 02:15:27,128
SAM: Oh. Okay. It was a million.

1827
02:15:27,128 --> 02:15:31,776
TALIESIN: I didn't know that that die went that
high.

1828
02:15:31,776 --> 02:15:34,738
SAM: 34.

1829
02:15:34,738 --> 02:15:37,141
LAURA: It's a million.

1830
02:15:37,141 --> 02:15:43,581
MATT: His arm relaxes at the side of his weapon,
and he looks down upon your diminutive gnomish

1831
02:15:43,581 --> 02:15:50,087
structure, though glances over at the much larger
goliath and back at you. "If you indeed have

1832
02:15:50,087 --> 02:15:57,031
"business with J'mon Sa Ord, then the emperor will
let you in. If you do not, you will be sent out.

1833
02:15:57,031 --> 02:16:04,641
"We have no business between either of those
answers. If you wish to enter, do so, but keep

1834
02:16:04,641 --> 02:16:10,492
"your weapons sheathed, and keep an eye on that
one."

1835
02:16:10,492 --> 02:16:12,097
SAM: The big one?

1836
02:16:12,097 --> 02:16:13,296
MATT: "Yes."

1837
02:16:13,296 --> 02:16:14,822
LIAM: He's well-behaved.

1838
02:16:14,822 --> 02:16:16,599
MATT: "I don't trust his face."

1839
02:16:16,599 --> 02:16:18,848
TALIESIN: His face is usually not the trouble.

1840
02:16:18,848 --> 02:16:21,157
LIAM: Is it the beard?

1841
02:16:21,157 --> 02:16:26,323
MATT: "Very well. Welcome to Ank'Harel. Be
pleased."

1842
02:16:26,323 --> 02:16:28,998
ALL: Be pleased.

1843
02:16:28,998 --> 02:16:34,194
MATT: He turns around and walks away. His bow is
much smaller than you were originally taught by

1844
02:16:34,194 --> 02:16:40,018
Jarett. You get the sense that that's more of a
formality and is on a smaller scale for more

1845
02:16:40,018 --> 02:16:44,427
informal conversations. As he walks back, he lifts
one hand and does a loop with it. As he does,

1846
02:16:44,427 --> 02:16:52,700
(door thudding). The gates open ever so slightly,
enough to bring through as broad-shouldered an

1847
02:16:52,700 --> 02:16:57,220
individual as Grog, as well as the rest of you
easily. You guys walk up and approach.

1848
02:16:57,220 --> 02:17:02,695
LAURA: Is anybody looking at Trinket weird, or is
it okay? He's with us.

1849
02:17:02,695 --> 02:17:06,376
MATT: Actually, no one seems to bat an eye at the
large bear that's wandering inside.

1850
02:17:06,376 --> 02:17:09,849
TRAVIS: But they give a shit about the goliath?
That's fucked up.

1851
02:17:09,849 --> 02:17:13,671
TALIESIN: One last question for our good friend at
the gate.

1852
02:17:13,671 --> 02:17:15,406
MATT: Okay, as you walk past him.

1853
02:17:15,406 --> 02:17:19,676
TALIESIN: One more thing, good sir. If you were
going to find a place to sleep comfortably,

1854
02:17:19,676 --> 02:17:24,518
quietly, and without incident for the evening in
the city, is there a place that you would

1855
02:17:24,518 --> 02:17:26,679
recommend to a friend?

1856
02:17:26,679 --> 02:17:33,876
MATT: "Well, best I can think, there are many fine
establishments of rest where rooms can be rented

1857
02:17:33,876 --> 02:17:42,971
"throughout the entirety of the city. Depending on
how much coin you have to give, I would say you

1858
02:17:42,971 --> 02:17:46,314
"could..." He thinks for a second as I look at my
notes.

1859
02:17:46,314 --> 02:17:49,325
TALIESIN: Where you would put a brother-in-law
that you liked?

1860
02:17:49,325 --> 02:17:50,578
LIAM: Medium to high.

1861
02:17:50,578 --> 02:18:00,355
MATT: "I would recommend within the Suncut Bazaar,
you would find the Debt's Respite, the Shade, or

1862
02:18:00,355 --> 02:18:07,427
"the Corner Cove. All very fine establishments, and
very well watched by the Hand."

1863
02:18:07,427 --> 02:18:09,648
TRAVIS: The Hand?

1864
02:18:09,648 --> 02:18:11,513
SAM: Are you a member of the Hand?

1865
02:18:11,513 --> 02:18:14,993
MATT: "I am. Is this your first time in the city,
then?"

1866
02:18:14,993 --> 02:18:16,558
TALIESIN: It is absolutely, yes.

1867
02:18:16,558 --> 02:18:18,455
MATT: (laughs)

1868
02:18:18,455 --> 02:18:21,069
MARISHA: What was the name of the district?

1869
02:18:21,069 --> 02:18:23,083
LAURA: The Suncut Bazaar.

1870
02:18:23,083 --> 02:18:24,363
MARISHA: Suncut Bazaar.

1871
02:18:24,363 --> 02:18:34,306
MATT: As he watches you guys enter, the gates
closing behind you, you now see the incredible

1872
02:18:34,306 --> 02:18:40,373
reveal of the interior of the mystical city
itself. Streets of smooth cobblestone-like red

1873
02:18:40,373 --> 02:18:45,878
pebbles lead your eyes to hundreds of visible,
vertically-inclined buildings of reaching peaks

1874
02:18:45,878 --> 02:18:52,512
and smooth, pointed rooftops as far as your eye
can see across the cityscape. It's a city of

1875
02:18:52,512 --> 02:18:57,607
vibrant color; you see nearly every home,
storefront, and outhouse has some form of draping

1876
02:18:57,607 --> 02:19:03,629
silks or painted mural to give it individual
character, standing out against the rest of its

1877
02:19:03,629 --> 02:19:09,594
neighboring abodes, creating a calming, beautiful
symphony of really nothing, in the presentation of

1878
02:19:09,594 --> 02:19:14,509
it all. The people are walking with purpose, and
the sounds of foreign barking and shouts

1879
02:19:14,509 --> 02:19:19,010
occasionally break the air. Welcome to Ank'Harel.

1880
02:19:19,010 --> 02:19:23,727
TALIESIN: Let's get arrested right now!

1881
02:19:23,727 --> 02:19:25,783
MARISHA: Fight!

1882
02:19:25,783 --> 02:19:28,226
MATT: What do you guys wish to do?

1883
02:19:28,226 --> 02:19:34,375
SAM: We need spice. We need to find out about this
merchant guy.

1884
02:19:34,375 --> 02:19:36,810
TRAVIS: Got to get laid.

1885
02:19:36,810 --> 02:19:40,360
SAM: We got to get laid. Every continent, right?
That's our pact.

1886
02:19:40,360 --> 02:19:46,323
(laughter)

1887
02:19:46,323 --> 02:19:49,297
TRAVIS: There's nothing that doesn't mean it's a
pact.

1888
02:19:49,297 --> 02:19:53,353
TALIESIN: We're going to need to talk to some
gentry. We're going to need to talk to a library.

1889
02:19:53,353 --> 02:19:56,531
MARISHA: Well, we should probably start with a
tavern.

1890
02:19:56,531 --> 02:20:01,446
TALIESIN: And I should also mention, not just a
tavern is available, but we do in fact have three

1891
02:20:01,446 --> 02:20:06,571
titled people within our crowd, so we can actually
talk to people of standing and note with very

1892
02:20:06,571 --> 02:20:07,950
little difficulty.

1893
02:20:07,950 --> 02:20:10,534
LIAM: Are we certain that that will hold any water
on this continent?

1894
02:20:10,534 --> 02:20:15,225
TALIESIN: It holds water on every continent. Only
people who are not titled think it doesn't.

1895
02:20:15,225 --> 02:20:23,529
SAM: Should we split up into a couple parties? No?
All right.

1896
02:20:23,529 --> 02:20:31,256
TALIESIN: Let's find a tavern, find some rooms.
Let's go to this bazaar.

1897
02:20:31,256 --> 02:20:33,708
MARISHA: People tend to know things in taverns.

1898
02:20:33,708 --> 02:20:36,039
TALIESIN: Get the word out of what we're looking
for.

1899
02:20:36,039 --> 02:20:37,482
SAM: To the Suncut Bazaar!

1900
02:20:37,482 --> 02:20:42,312
TRAVIS: Wait, what if there's a market, like an
open farmer's market we could get some spice?

1901
02:20:42,312 --> 02:20:52,446
LAURA: Yeah. As we look around, do we see any
markets? Actually, the shopping district would be

1902
02:20:52,446 --> 02:20:54,278
a wonderful place to look for--

1903
02:20:54,278 --> 02:20:58,425
MARISHA: Is that in the Suncut Bazaar, or could we
head that direction while we look?

1904
02:20:58,425 --> 02:21:00,888
SAM: Oi! Oi, you there, boy!

1905
02:21:00,888 --> 02:21:04,985
(laughter)

1906
02:21:04,985 --> 02:21:10,585
MATT: As you glance over, you see walking down the
street what appears to be two teenage boys,

1907
02:21:10,585 --> 02:21:20,044
huddled together, wearing drab, ankle-length cloth
robes. One of them has a purple shawl over

1908
02:21:20,044 --> 02:21:25,850
their shoulders. The other has a hood up, and
they're both carrying small satchels of fruit in

1909
02:21:25,850 --> 02:21:34,029
their arms. They both stop and turn. They look
curiously at the small gnome, the small, pale

1910
02:21:34,029 --> 02:21:39,050
gnome in foreign clothes and adorned, beautiful
armor that walks up to them in the street.

1911
02:21:39,050 --> 02:21:47,648
SAM: That looks like fine fruit. Where would you
go to go shopping for things here, market-y things?

1912
02:21:47,648 --> 02:21:54,629
MATT: (muttered conversation) "You are a very
small man."

1913
02:21:54,629 --> 02:21:57,847
SAM: I've heard that. It's a glandular condition.

1914
02:21:57,847 --> 02:22:00,562
(laughter)

1915
02:22:00,562 --> 02:22:02,359
MATT: "I'm sorry to hear that."

1916
02:22:02,359 --> 02:22:10,247
SAM: Yes. My cross to bear. I've seen many
medicine men about it, but they can't cure it, but

1917
02:22:10,247 --> 02:22:15,048
many have recommended that I get a diet of
vegetables and fruit. Where could I buy some, just

1918
02:22:15,048 --> 02:22:16,498
like the kind that you have?

1919
02:22:16,498 --> 02:22:20,121
MATT: "This fruit is actually very difficult to
find and come across. If you wish, you could

1920
02:22:20,121 --> 02:22:21,669
"purchase this batch."

1921
02:22:21,669 --> 02:22:28,057
SAM: Okay. I've seen this before. I'm not
interested in buying from you. I just want a

1922
02:22:28,057 --> 02:22:30,099
market or a bazaar or anything.

1923
02:22:30,099 --> 02:22:32,573
MATT: "Bazaar. You are looking for the Suncut
Bazaar?"

1924
02:22:32,573 --> 02:22:33,818
SAM: Yeah, that!

1925
02:22:33,818 --> 02:22:38,792
MATT: "It is farther down that way. Look to the
blue tower in the center of the city? Walk in its

1926
02:22:38,792 --> 02:22:41,681
"direction to the eastern skyline--"

1927
02:22:41,681 --> 02:22:45,025
LAURA: I'm not looking in the direction. I'm
keeping my eyes on them the entire time he's

1928
02:22:45,025 --> 02:22:46,124
talking.

1929
02:22:46,124 --> 02:22:47,686
MATT: Okay, make a perception check.

1930
02:22:47,686 --> 02:22:50,831
MARISHA: I'm desperately trying to commit every
direction to memory.

1931
02:22:50,831 --> 02:22:56,785
TALIESIN: I am so fearful that he's about to try
and buy meth from children.

1932
02:22:56,785 --> 02:22:58,136
LAURA: 20.

1933
02:22:58,136 --> 02:23:03,887
MATT: "Look for the strings of crimson flags that
hang across the very street corners. That will

1934
02:23:03,887 --> 02:23:05,965
"signify the entrance to the Suncut Bazaar."

1935
02:23:05,965 --> 02:23:08,452
SAM: You're so helpful.

1936
02:23:08,452 --> 02:23:12,306
MATT: 20. They both seem confused, but also
strangely enamored with this tiny man who's

1937
02:23:12,306 --> 02:23:15,183
talking to them. No shifty behavior beyond that.

1938
02:23:15,183 --> 02:23:19,378
TRAVIS: Their hands aren't moving into someone's
pockets?

1939
02:23:19,378 --> 02:23:21,334
LAURA: No.

1940
02:23:21,334 --> 02:23:28,579
SAM: Thank you so much, young men, for your help.
Also, spice?

1941
02:23:28,579 --> 02:23:31,443
(laughter)

1942
02:23:31,443 --> 02:23:32,909
TRAVIS: Yes! Oh my god!

1943
02:23:32,909 --> 02:23:34,963
TALIESIN: No!

1944
02:23:34,963 --> 02:23:36,143
SAM: Do you spice?

1945
02:23:36,143 --> 02:23:37,486
MARISHA: Do you spice?!

1946
02:23:37,486 --> 02:23:39,246
TRAVIS: Yo, you cool? You cool, dog?

1947
02:23:39,246 --> 02:23:41,850
MATT: (muttered conversation) "I don't know what
you're talking about."

1948
02:23:41,850 --> 02:23:47,770
SAM: I'm not an authority. Do you spice? Spice
it?

1949
02:23:47,770 --> 02:23:50,623
MATT: "I am sorry. I'm confused?"

1950
02:23:50,623 --> 02:23:57,185
SAM: It's cool. Ignore that part. Thank you so
much. What do you think, a little spice?

1951
02:23:57,185 --> 02:24:00,229
MATT: He puts his hand out.

1952
02:24:00,229 --> 02:24:02,894
SAM: I flip him a coin.

1953
02:24:02,894 --> 02:24:07,650
MATT: He takes it. "Good luck finding your
fruit."

1954
02:24:07,650 --> 02:24:09,144
SAM: Okay. Thank you.

1955
02:24:09,144 --> 02:24:14,755
MATT: And they both walk away, but at a slow pace,
looking over their shoulder at you the whole way.

1956
02:24:14,755 --> 02:24:19,603
SAM: They seemed legit! They seemed like they were
street kids.

1957
02:24:19,603 --> 02:24:21,749
TALIESIN: What about that was legit?!

1958
02:24:21,749 --> 02:24:24,801
SAM: They're riffraff. They could know what spice
is.

1959
02:24:24,801 --> 02:24:26,988
TALIESIN: They were carrying fruit!

1960
02:24:26,988 --> 02:24:33,118
SAM: They look normal, but I've got a keen eye for
these things. I was a kid on the street for a long time.

1961
02:24:33,118 --> 02:24:35,194
LIAM: Sam? No joke, thanks for the ab workout.

1962
02:24:35,194 --> 02:24:38,430
(laughter)

1963
02:24:38,430 --> 02:24:40,078
TALIESIN: Oh god.

1964
02:24:40,078 --> 02:24:43,449
TRAVIS: Fuck. That was great.

1965
02:24:43,449 --> 02:24:44,995
TALIESIN: I can't.

1966
02:24:44,995 --> 02:24:47,300
LIAM: (deep sigh)

1967
02:24:47,300 --> 02:24:49,864
TRAVIS: Do we go in the direction?

1968
02:24:49,864 --> 02:24:54,201
LAURA: We walk towards the Suncut Bazaar, keeping
an eye out.

1969
02:24:54,201 --> 02:25:03,035
MATT: All right. As you guys continue deeper into
the city, the sheer size of this town reminds you

1970
02:25:03,035 --> 02:25:09,487
of a mirror universe form of Emon, in the way
that the streets narrow and then open, and the

1971
02:25:09,487 --> 02:25:16,222
liveliness of culture around you in its heyday,
and it saddens you, because it reminds you of back

1972
02:25:16,222 --> 02:25:19,390
when the city was at its prime, when you first
arrived and made it a home for yourself. But at

1973
02:25:19,390 --> 02:25:27,343
the same time, the energy is infectious, and you
can't help but feel like there's a lot of

1974
02:25:27,343 --> 02:25:34,465
interesting people, culture, and momentum all
about you no matter where you seem to walk across

1975
02:25:34,465 --> 02:25:40,046
these streets. Though the culture here appears to
be far older than that of Emon that you've

1976
02:25:40,046 --> 02:25:44,134
encountered; even the buildings and constructs
range in ways that-- maybe not as old as

1977
02:25:44,134 --> 02:25:50,084
Vasselheim, per se, but at least you can see that
there's some variation to some of the abodes here

1978
02:25:50,084 --> 02:25:55,940
that have been worn through time more so than any
you have encountered in Tal'Dorei, for the most

1979
02:25:55,940 --> 02:26:01,739
part. These decorated and intricate buildings fill
the streets. You can see pride in their

1980
02:26:01,739 --> 02:26:09,573
construction, and the smells of horses and hot
desert air combine with various burning spice and

1981
02:26:09,573 --> 02:26:15,136
sage that occasionally wafts through the air to
your nostrils. The ever-changing exotic skyline

1982
02:26:15,136 --> 02:26:19,590
occasionally grabs your attention. You see the
distant shadow of what looks like a skyship docked

1983
02:26:19,590 --> 02:26:24,608
at a sky port. You get looks of many citizens,
expressions ranging from amusement to mistrust as

1984
02:26:24,608 --> 02:26:31,770
you pass by, until you come upon a massive
building that shines with the sunlight.

1985
02:26:31,770 --> 02:26:41,928
Above you, you see a number of red flags that hang
and drift, about five feet in length, these thin,

1986
02:26:41,928 --> 02:26:47,682
draping pieces of silk that shift with the breeze,
and you can see numbers of these strands across

1987
02:26:47,682 --> 02:26:53,129
different roads, and it's at this point that you
look up and realize that this is the entrance to

1988
02:26:53,129 --> 02:26:59,149
the Suncut Bazaar. Looking off towards the left,
and what you've been watching as you

1989
02:26:59,149 --> 02:27:07,541
approach, there are this cluster of dark blue
and purple towers of various widths marking a

1990
02:27:07,541 --> 02:27:12,434
central place in the center of the city. In the
center of them, there is one very large,

1991
02:27:12,434 --> 02:27:19,228
cylindrical tower that rises up past them all into
what looks like a chalice or a cup-like platform

1992
02:27:19,228 --> 02:27:24,657
at the very top that is impossibly high amongst
the rest of the structures here in the city. It

1993
02:27:24,657 --> 02:27:29,530
seems to be a beacon or watchtower over the
entirety of Ank'Harel.

1994
02:27:29,530 --> 02:27:36,048
But your attention now, here in the Suncut Bazaar,
as you step around the corner, you can see tents

1995
02:27:36,048 --> 02:27:42,319
and storefronts and buildings and voices raised as
different barkers are shouting out for their

1996
02:27:42,319 --> 02:27:47,143
wares. You can see carts being drawn through the
streets by horse and camel. You can see what

1997
02:27:47,143 --> 02:27:52,500
appear to be dozens upon dozens of people coming
through with small satchels and coming by and

1998
02:27:52,500 --> 02:27:58,510
purchasing their necessities for the day. You can
smell cooking meats and food in the distance. You

1999
02:27:58,510 --> 02:28:05,142
can see street performers juggling, and distant
music of buskers in the side of the street,

2000
02:28:05,142 --> 02:28:11,731
playing various flutes and instruments: some you
recognize, some you do not. You actually see a

2001
02:28:11,731 --> 02:28:14,232
shawm. It catches your attention on the side of
the street.

2002
02:28:14,232 --> 02:28:15,880
SAM: I need a new reed for that.

2003
02:28:15,880 --> 02:28:20,824
MATT: And here you are, amongst the Suncut
Bazaar.

2004
02:28:20,824 --> 02:28:24,528
TRAVIS: Can I whip around and see if anyone's
following us?

2005
02:28:24,528 --> 02:28:26,301
SAM: Ooh, Dust of Tracelessness.

2006
02:28:26,301 --> 02:28:27,776
MATT: Make a perception check.

2007
02:28:27,776 --> 02:28:33,141
TRAVIS: Hammer down! 14.

2008
02:28:33,141 --> 02:28:37,419
MATT: 14. No matter where you walk, eyes are on
you.

2009
02:28:37,419 --> 02:28:39,729
TRAVIS: I am a gorgeous man.

2010
02:28:39,729 --> 02:28:47,810
MATT: Most people you come around here, it seems a
largely human population. Beyond that, you've not

2011
02:28:47,810 --> 02:28:51,939
seen a single dwarf as you've walked through the
city, but you have seen a number of dark-skinned

2012
02:28:51,939 --> 02:28:58,800
halflings, a few half-elves. Not an elf has caught
your eye since you've wandered through. You've

2013
02:28:58,800 --> 02:29:06,931
seen a couple of tieflings that walk openly in
this city, which is a rare thing from Emon. Even

2014
02:29:06,931 --> 02:29:14,500
there, most tieflings generally are met with
mistrust and prejudice in the street. Here, no one

2015
02:29:14,500 --> 02:29:22,830
seems to pay mind or bother. You do see a few
half-orcs, this team of half-orcs that are shouting

2016
02:29:22,830 --> 02:29:29,493
out in a language that none of you understand.
Some sort of sales pitch they're giving, and

2017
02:29:29,493 --> 02:29:35,340
there's a few people gathered around them. This is
a very wide variety of people that live in this

2018
02:29:35,340 --> 02:29:43,223
city, and everyone seems to mesh together without
issue or prejudice, but not one goliath has caught

2019
02:29:43,223 --> 02:29:48,134
your eye, and you've caught the eyes of many. And
wherever you walk, you can see the townspeople

2020
02:29:48,134 --> 02:29:57,006
stop, and they don't gawk. They don't
stare intently. They're more curious, but no one

2021
02:29:57,006 --> 02:29:59,131
appears to be following you.

2022
02:29:59,131 --> 02:30:03,047
LAURA: Are the shops here indoors, or are they
outdoor tent markets?

2023
02:30:03,047 --> 02:30:07,036
MATT: There are a few that appear to go into
buildings, but the majority of this, as you look

2024
02:30:07,036 --> 02:30:13,849
at now the Suncut Bazaar itself, while it is a
section of the city, it is mostly open sky and is

2025
02:30:13,849 --> 02:30:23,528
probably hundreds of various tents, carts, pop-up
stand-ups, and even the center of the street,

2026
02:30:23,528 --> 02:30:29,175
blankets set out, with the various merchants there
with their wares strewn across the ground, waiting

2027
02:30:29,175 --> 02:30:30,742
for anybody to come and approach.

2028
02:30:30,742 --> 02:30:32,224
LAURA: Do we see any spice merchants?

2029
02:30:32,224 --> 02:30:34,134
MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check.

2030
02:30:34,134 --> 02:30:36,825
LIAM: Also, while she's rolling, do we all see
people eyeballing him?

2031
02:30:36,825 --> 02:30:39,885
MATT: Yeah. It's pretty easy to see, and most
everyone's--

2032
02:30:39,885 --> 02:30:44,689
TRAVIS: In love? Enamored? Jealous?

2033
02:30:44,689 --> 02:30:46,639
LAURA: 11.

2034
02:30:46,639 --> 02:30:53,230
MATT: 11. You look around and ask a few people,
and most everyone shrugs their shoulders or points

2035
02:30:53,230 --> 02:30:57,472
you in an odd direction, and no immediate spice
merchants catch your attention. You're still on

2036
02:30:57,472 --> 02:30:59,282
the outskirts of the Suncut.

2037
02:30:59,282 --> 02:31:02,861
MARISHA: Do there appear to be any fruit
merchants?

2038
02:31:02,861 --> 02:31:08,997
MATT: There are a few, actually. Yeah. And it's
interesting. In this very hot desert environment,

2039
02:31:08,997 --> 02:31:15,503
and you understanding how most plant life exists,
fruit should be pretty damn rare, and what fruit

2040
02:31:15,503 --> 02:31:19,654
would make it here seems to be pretty dry and
withered. But everything you come across here is very

2041
02:31:19,654 --> 02:31:22,012
plump, beautiful, and fresh.

2042
02:31:22,012 --> 02:31:23,332
TALIESIN: Life.

2043
02:31:23,332 --> 02:31:25,796
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Needs things to live.

2044
02:31:25,796 --> 02:31:33,050
MARISHA: There's not many things, no. Can I go up
to one of the fruit merchants?

2045
02:31:33,050 --> 02:31:40,168
MATT: You go up to what appears to be a woman,
probably in her late thirties. Her hair is long

2046
02:31:40,168 --> 02:31:46,393
past her shoulders, and these dark black, brunette
waves that spray out like mermaid hair across her

2047
02:31:46,393 --> 02:31:53,335
shoulders. As you approach, she eagerly reaches
out. "You look like you are traveling here to

2048
02:31:53,335 --> 02:32:00,647
"Ank'Harel in search of beautiful, delicious fruits
of which to whet your palate. Yes? Would you like for

2049
02:32:00,647 --> 02:32:04,557
"these fine apples, of which are the finest you
could find?"

2050
02:32:04,557 --> 02:32:10,094
MARISHA: Apples? Oh wow. I was looking for
something a little bit more exotic. Something

2051
02:32:10,094 --> 02:32:11,533
native to this land.

2052
02:32:11,533 --> 02:32:17,196
MATT: "Ah, well--" She takes the apples back.
"What you'd prefer, then, would be the kurrak

2053
02:32:17,196 --> 02:32:22,169
"fruit." And she pulls out what looks like a mango,
but the exterior of it is very rough, with these

2054
02:32:22,169 --> 02:32:27,451
little spines all around it. "While it is
difficult to hold, crack open for a delightful

2055
02:32:27,451 --> 02:32:32,703
"flavor. It is gentle. It is like a sweet water
experience."

2056
02:32:32,703 --> 02:32:37,367
MARISHA: That was very descriptive. Thank you.

2057
02:32:37,367 --> 02:32:39,083
MATT: "Of course."

2058
02:32:39,083 --> 02:32:40,720
MARISHA: How much do I owe you for this?

2059
02:32:40,720 --> 02:32:43,237
MATT: "For this, that would be two silver
pieces."

2060
02:32:43,237 --> 02:32:47,806
MARISHA: Two silver. And how much, just for future
reference, are the apples?

2061
02:32:47,806 --> 02:32:50,414
MATT: "The apples would go for one silver piece
apiece."

2062
02:32:50,414 --> 02:32:58,070
MARISHA: One silver apiece. That's pretty steep.
Don't worry about it. Here you go. I give her a

2063
02:32:58,070 --> 02:32:59,554
little extra.

2064
02:32:59,554 --> 02:33:04,257
MATT: "Thank you so much for your patronage.
Anything else you would like?"

2065
02:33:04,257 --> 02:33:05,959
MARISHA: I think I'm good, thank you.

2066
02:33:05,959 --> 02:33:10,060
LAURA: I peek around her shoulder. Where would the
Shade be?

2067
02:33:10,060 --> 02:33:19,399
MATT: "The Shade? The Shade would be-- it's hard
to explain. Do you see that building over there

2068
02:33:19,399 --> 02:33:26,594
"with the dark green steeple?" And you glance off
in the distance. You can see, layers back, there

2069
02:33:26,594 --> 02:33:33,879
appears to be one spire, this very harsh point
that has a dark green tint. "That is the roof of

2070
02:33:33,879 --> 02:33:35,695
"the Shade. That'd be what you're looking for."

2071
02:33:35,695 --> 02:33:37,025
LAURA: Thank you so much.

2072
02:33:37,025 --> 02:33:38,171
MATT: "Not a problem."

2073
02:33:38,171 --> 02:33:41,216
LIAM: I would like to walk by, and as I'm passing
Vex, I'm going to do that thing where you walk

2074
02:33:41,216 --> 02:33:45,863
past a friend and you do that sideways kick in the
butt, and I'm going to go stand by Grog, and

2075
02:33:45,863 --> 02:33:50,297
anybody I see giving him the evil eye, I'm going
to match it back.

2076
02:33:50,297 --> 02:33:55,543
MATT: Okay. You watch as she walks away, she had
her hands out to Vex, and as soon as Vex keeps

2077
02:33:55,543 --> 02:33:57,745
walking away, she goes--

2078
02:33:57,745 --> 02:34:02,243
MARISHA: I toss her a gold. She's with me.

2079
02:34:02,243 --> 02:34:07,109
MATT: "You are free to shop here any day you
like."

2080
02:34:07,109 --> 02:34:08,770
MARISHA: And what was your name?

2081
02:34:08,770 --> 02:34:13,157
MATT: She pulls the coin out and pops it away and
says, "I am Shubad."

2082
02:34:13,157 --> 02:34:14,424
MARISHA: Shubad?

2083
02:34:14,424 --> 02:34:15,626
MATT: "Shubad."

2084
02:34:15,626 --> 02:34:16,902
MARISHA: Keyleth.

2085
02:34:16,902 --> 02:34:18,415
MATT: "A pleasure to meet you."

2086
02:34:18,415 --> 02:34:20,051
MARISHA: A pleasure. Thank you so much.

2087
02:34:20,051 --> 02:34:25,058
TRAVIS: Are any of the barkers talking about magic
stuff?

2088
02:34:25,058 --> 02:34:28,353
TALIESIN: I'm also looking for a soothsayer.

2089
02:34:28,353 --> 02:34:29,651
LIAM: What do you want to see, a show?

2090
02:34:29,651 --> 02:34:33,578
TRAVIS: Well, I don't know. It just seems so
exotic.

2091
02:34:33,578 --> 02:34:37,815
TALIESIN: Anything out of the ordinary and/or a
soothsayer, card-reader, bones-reader, whatever

2092
02:34:37,815 --> 02:34:39,521
they have that's like that.

2093
02:34:39,521 --> 02:34:44,476
MATT: Okay. Both of you make investigation checks
as you look around and ask around.

2094
02:34:44,476 --> 02:34:50,060
LIAM: And I don't like the way these folks are
looking at big man, so I'm going to stay by him.

2095
02:34:50,060 --> 02:34:51,801
MATT: You stay close to Grog.

2096
02:34:51,801 --> 02:34:53,897
LAURA: No going up from that. That's what it is.

2097
02:34:53,897 --> 02:34:55,193
TRAVIS: Negative two.

2098
02:34:55,193 --> 02:34:58,413
(laughter)

2099
02:34:58,413 --> 02:34:59,844
SAM: Is that true?

2100
02:34:59,844 --> 02:35:01,188
TRAVIS: Yep.

2101
02:35:01,188 --> 02:35:03,573
TALIESIN: I am city-blind, apparently.

2102
02:35:03,573 --> 02:35:05,351
LAURA: What are you looking for?

2103
02:35:05,351 --> 02:35:08,695
TALIESIN: I'm looking for anything out of the
ordinary, but specifically, a soothsayer, a

2104
02:35:08,695 --> 02:35:10,622
card-reader, a bones-thrower.

2105
02:35:10,622 --> 02:35:16,904
MATT: Grog. Glancing about, you look to see
something shine across the ground. As you rush up

2106
02:35:16,904 --> 02:35:23,150
and find it, you find what looks to be a magically
enchanted stone about that big. Rough around the

2107
02:35:23,150 --> 02:35:26,964
edges, but the reddish color is brighter red than
the rest of the stones on the ground, and you're

2108
02:35:26,964 --> 02:35:30,192
sure that this may be exactly what you were
looking for.

2109
02:35:30,192 --> 02:35:31,655
LIAM: I'm watching him.

2110
02:35:31,655 --> 02:35:35,040
TRAVIS: I quickly get on my hands and knees, and I
start moving the sand around, looking for one just

2111
02:35:35,040 --> 02:35:37,605
like it, just to make sure it's unique.

2112
02:35:37,605 --> 02:35:42,006
MATT: There are many red stones around it, as you
press the bit of dust and sand gathered around the

2113
02:35:42,006 --> 02:35:44,550
other cobblestones, but this one appears to be
unique.

2114
02:35:44,550 --> 02:35:52,343
TRAVIS: Oh! What does it taste like?

2115
02:35:52,343 --> 02:35:58,008
MATT: There's a hit of saltiness to the dust that
has gathered in this vicinity.

2116
02:35:58,008 --> 02:35:59,906
TRAVIS: I gave away my salt-lick rock!

2117
02:35:59,906 --> 02:36:01,815
MATT: You did.

2118
02:36:01,815 --> 02:36:05,222
(laughter)

2119
02:36:05,222 --> 02:36:11,596
LIAM: I take a moment to marvel at how a being of
such ferocity and power can be such a doofus at

2120
02:36:11,596 --> 02:36:14,854
the same time. It's amazing.

2121
02:36:14,854 --> 02:36:19,267
SAM: I'm going to plant myself at the end of two
rows of the intersection and wait for people to

2122
02:36:19,267 --> 02:36:29,554
walk by. And as they do, I say: Spice? Spice,
spice, spice? You spice it? Spice, spice, spice?

2123
02:36:29,554 --> 02:36:35,903
LAURA: Can I have seen Percy looking around?

2124
02:36:35,903 --> 02:36:36,981
MATT: Yeah.

2125
02:36:36,981 --> 02:36:38,957
LAURA: Can I help him look?

2126
02:36:38,957 --> 02:36:40,590
MATT: Percival, what did you roll?

2127
02:36:40,590 --> 02:36:45,859
TALIESIN: Where did it go? Investigation? I rolled
a nine.

2128
02:36:45,859 --> 02:36:55,378
MATT: Yeah. It's funny. For all the preparation of
being a noble and public speaking, you are utterly lost.

2129
02:36:55,378 --> 02:36:58,272
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm terrible in urban areas. I've
learned this. I get flustered.

2130
02:36:58,272 --> 02:37:01,451
MATT: The culture is so vastly different from what
you're used to, and the people don't seem to

2131
02:37:01,451 --> 02:37:09,084
really pay much mind to your relatively important
outfit and presence, and you're lost at sea.

2132
02:37:09,084 --> 02:37:11,991
TALIESIN: I've never rolled a decent investigation
check. It has never happened.

2133
02:37:11,991 --> 02:37:14,926
MATT: Vex walks up to you.

2134
02:37:14,926 --> 02:37:16,981
LAURA: What are you looking for, dear?

2135
02:37:16,981 --> 02:37:21,086
TALIESIN: Beyond anything interesting. Everything
is too interesting.

2136
02:37:21,086 --> 02:37:23,456
LAURA: It's very colorful.

2137
02:37:23,456 --> 02:37:26,963
TALIESIN: A soothsayer of some kind, perhaps. It
might be a good way to start getting the word out

2138
02:37:26,963 --> 02:37:28,604
of the sorts of things we're looking for.

2139
02:37:28,604 --> 02:37:30,795
LAURA: What sorts of things?

2140
02:37:30,795 --> 02:37:35,435
TALIESIN: We're looking for a cloak. We're looking
for a merchant with one eye.

2141
02:37:35,435 --> 02:37:36,980
TRAVIS: I found a rock!

2142
02:37:36,980 --> 02:37:42,142
TALIESIN: And we're looking for rocks-- not
anymore, I suppose. And those are usually the most

2143
02:37:42,142 --> 02:37:48,629
trustworthy of the untrustworthy people you find
in a city.

2144
02:37:48,629 --> 02:37:50,844
LAURA: Investigation? 19.

2145
02:37:50,844 --> 02:37:59,855
MATT: 19. The two of you begin to meander around,
look around. You see, after some wandering, what

2146
02:37:59,855 --> 02:38:09,081
looks to be a single blanket set out with a small
half-dome shade structure of various cotton cloths

2147
02:38:09,081 --> 02:38:16,334
that have been layered and pinned to create this
loose escape from the sunlight. And you see what

2148
02:38:16,334 --> 02:38:23,922
appears to be an older man with a very long
braided beard that goes past his belly-button. He

2149
02:38:23,922 --> 02:38:32,671
sits there, sleeveless open shirt, baggy pants, no
shoes, and before him a deck of cards that is

2150
02:38:32,671 --> 02:38:36,035
laying in a stack, and he has his eyes closed with
his hands resting at the ends of his knees.

2151
02:38:36,035 --> 02:38:39,051
LIAM: It sounds like fun.

2152
02:38:39,051 --> 02:38:40,852
LAURA: Want to walk up? Yeah?

2153
02:38:40,852 --> 02:38:43,049
TALIESIN: You mind blowing a little bit of money
on this?

2154
02:38:43,049 --> 02:38:44,936
LAURA: No, actually.

2155
02:38:44,936 --> 02:38:46,620
MARISHA: Are we all there?

2156
02:38:46,620 --> 02:38:48,468
MATT: Depends on if you guys want to follow.

2157
02:38:48,468 --> 02:38:49,943
MARISHA: I'd like to follow.

2158
02:38:49,943 --> 02:38:52,557
MATT: Okay. as you guys are approaching, you over
in the corner.

2159
02:38:52,557 --> 02:38:58,306
SAM: Spice it? Spice it? Fusaka!

2160
02:38:58,306 --> 02:39:00,618
MATT: Make a deception check.

2161
02:39:00,618 --> 02:39:07,499
SAM: A billion. Deception?

2162
02:39:07,499 --> 02:39:08,767
MATT: Deception, yeah.

2163
02:39:08,767 --> 02:39:09,898
SAM: 32.

2164
02:39:09,898 --> 02:39:16,685
MATT: This marks your ability to double-talk or
subtly put out the vibes for an individual.

2165
02:39:16,685 --> 02:39:19,560
LIAM: Why aren't you a crime kingpin?

2166
02:39:19,560 --> 02:39:23,967
MATT: Who knows what Scanlan's ultimate destiny
is?

2167
02:39:23,967 --> 02:39:27,795
TALIESIN: I have a song for your next playlist.
I'm so excited.

2168
02:39:27,795 --> 02:39:37,082
MATT: After a few moments of you doing this and a
few people walking away, looking frustrated and

2169
02:39:37,082 --> 02:39:46,108
taken aback, partially by your visual form and the
unexpected contents of your words, one man in his

2170
02:39:46,108 --> 02:39:53,165
early twenties walking up, what looks to be a damp
cloth wrapped loosely around the head to keep the

2171
02:39:53,165 --> 02:40:02,968
head cooled under the sun's heat, walks up and
leans in and goes, "You're asking about spice, yes?"

2172
02:40:02,968 --> 02:40:12,550
SAM: Yes, hard-to-find spice. I don't know if they
have it in this particular bazaar. It takes a

2173
02:40:12,550 --> 02:40:17,133
seller with a keen eye to identify it.

2174
02:40:17,133 --> 02:40:23,230
MATT: "Well, I know folks who are purveyors of
many spices here. Please, what do you seek?"

2175
02:40:23,230 --> 02:40:32,234
SAM: It's not really something that I want to
discuss out in the open, but we could take a walk

2176
02:40:32,234 --> 02:40:34,298
and talk about it.

2177
02:40:34,298 --> 02:40:43,643
MATT: "Good, good. Lead on. We'll have a
conversation as we go." As he stands back up after

2178
02:40:43,643 --> 02:40:51,224
leaning down for you, you get a little glance at
what appears to be a slightly pointed ear and what

2179
02:40:51,224 --> 02:40:57,405
looks like a hint of a mustache that's grown
through. Very similar in visual presentation as to

2180
02:40:57,405 --> 02:41:05,519
your comrades: not full elf, not full human,
though definitely a much darker shade due to the

2181
02:41:05,519 --> 02:41:12,485
out-in-the-open lifestyle of Ank'Harel. You begin
to walk with this figure through the street. We'll

2182
02:41:12,485 --> 02:41:20,011
get to you in just a moment. So as you guys make
your way to the older gentleman sitting on the

2183
02:41:20,011 --> 02:41:22,725
ground, eyes closed.

2184
02:41:22,725 --> 02:41:25,849
LAURA: We sit down in front of him.

2185
02:41:25,849 --> 02:41:28,880
MATT: His eyes are still closed.

2186
02:41:28,880 --> 02:41:31,449
LAURA, TALIESIN, and MARISHA: Be pleased.

2187
02:41:31,449 --> 02:41:41,092
MATT: "Be pleased." His eyes open, and you can see
his eyes are snow-blind. They are clouded over

2188
02:41:41,092 --> 02:41:45,563
with what would probably be terrible cataracts or
something else that has caused him full blindness,

2189
02:41:45,563 --> 02:41:53,296
but he stares past you as he opens his eyes. "So
you wish to be read, then?"

2190
02:41:53,296 --> 02:41:56,667
LAURA, MARISHA, and TALIESIN: Yes.

2191
02:41:56,667 --> 02:42:00,456
MATT: "Five gold for my services."

2192
02:42:00,456 --> 02:42:03,743
SAM: (whispers) He won't know what you put in his
hand!

2193
02:42:03,743 --> 02:42:06,134
TALIESIN: You're not there.

2194
02:42:06,134 --> 02:42:10,403
MARISHA: He will know. He's a fortune teller, for
Christ's sake.

2195
02:42:10,403 --> 02:42:12,176
LIAM: Five plumbing washers.

2196
02:42:12,176 --> 02:42:14,298
LAURA: Should I put five or 15, for each of us?

2197
02:42:14,298 --> 02:42:18,906
TALIESIN: Five, for the moment. He knows there's
three of us.

2198
02:42:18,906 --> 02:42:29,875
MATT: He places it into a small side pouch. "What
do you wish to be read for?" He takes the cards

2199
02:42:29,875 --> 02:42:31,917
and begins shuffling.

2200
02:42:31,917 --> 02:42:35,583
TALIESIN: We search for a garment. We search for a
man.

2201
02:42:35,583 --> 02:42:39,592
MATT: His way of shuffling cards is interesting.
As opposed to the usual like double shuffle, he

2202
02:42:39,592 --> 02:42:44,778
picks up the deck in one hand and splits it and
then shuffles it together. Turns it around, splits

2203
02:42:44,778 --> 02:42:50,793
it, and then shuffles it together on each side.
It's this weird boy with a crystal in Labyrinth,

2204
02:42:50,793 --> 02:42:55,643
but with a card deck. It's wild. As he stays
still, looking past all of you.

2205
02:42:55,643 --> 02:43:00,578
TALIESIN: And we search for answers towards the
future that we inevitably run to.

2206
02:43:00,578 --> 02:43:10,402
MATT: The shuffling stops, and he grabs the deck.
"You search for a garment." And he takes two cards

2207
02:43:10,402 --> 02:43:15,008
out and throws them across the center of the
blanket for you guys. You guys step back and take

2208
02:43:15,008 --> 02:43:26,835
a look. One of them appears to have a fire or a
camp flame with smoke pouring up out of it, and

2209
02:43:26,835 --> 02:43:36,317
the other one appears to have a storm, a torrent
of water, and he goes, "This garment you seek. It

2210
02:43:36,317 --> 02:43:57,724
"looks to be in motion, moving. If you seek this
garment here, may haste take you. Your second

2211
02:43:57,724 --> 02:44:00,921
"question." What were you saying in the second
one?

2212
02:44:00,921 --> 02:44:02,573
TALIESIN: We search for a man.

2213
02:44:02,573 --> 02:44:03,925
LAURA: With one eye.

2214
02:44:03,925 --> 02:44:05,512
TALIESIN: Well, I didn't say that far.

2215
02:44:05,512 --> 02:44:07,421
MARISHA: A merchant warrior. Missing.

2216
02:44:07,421 --> 02:44:10,790
TALIESIN: He doesn't need that. He's fine.

2217
02:44:10,790 --> 02:44:12,304
MATT: What did you say?

2218
02:44:12,304 --> 02:44:14,407
TALIESIN: Oh, we search for a man.

2219
02:44:14,407 --> 02:44:21,022
MATT: Pulls up two more cards and throws them, and
they land almost exactly in the same place as the

2220
02:44:21,022 --> 02:44:27,142
other two cards that he tossed before. They scoot
to a stop. One card appears to be mostly blank,

2221
02:44:27,142 --> 02:44:35,993
except it carries some sort of a stylized symbol
or letter that you don't recognize. And the other

2222
02:44:35,993 --> 02:44:56,780
one appears to be a hand of cards stuffed within a
pile of coin. "You seek this man, yet it is not a

2223
02:44:56,780 --> 02:45:09,697
"man you seek. To where the luck brings you, the
answers lie." And he puts out his hand.

2224
02:45:09,697 --> 02:45:16,005
TALIESIN: Five more. <i>Five more.</i>

2225
02:45:16,005 --> 02:45:24,969
MATT: "And the third question?"

2226
02:45:24,969 --> 02:45:31,796
LAURA: Can I insight check him as he's reading the
cards? See if his face twitches at all, if it

2227
02:45:31,796 --> 02:45:33,547
looks like he's making shit up.

2228
02:45:33,547 --> 02:45:37,122
MATT: Go for it.

2229
02:45:37,122 --> 02:45:42,885
LAURA: 21?

2230
02:45:42,885 --> 02:45:49,318
SAM: Oh, the whispers! So many whispers. How are
the Cowboys doing, Travis?

2231
02:45:49,318 --> 02:45:50,925
TRAVIS: I stopped looking.

2232
02:45:50,925 --> 02:45:52,587
SAM: I can tell you how they're doing.

2233
02:45:52,587 --> 02:45:55,020
LIAM: Sounds like a sad man right there.

2234
02:45:55,020 --> 02:45:58,219
TALIESIN: Wait, let's consult the cards. That's
the third question.

2235
02:45:58,219 --> 02:46:00,109
TRAVIS: It's pre-season. Nobody playing right
now.

2236
02:46:00,109 --> 02:46:01,508
SAM: Oh yeah, sure.

2237
02:46:01,508 --> 02:46:03,439
TALIESIN: The cards say the Cowboys are not--

2238
02:46:03,439 --> 02:46:05,841
SAM: Hey, maybe you and me should go to a game
sometime.

2239
02:46:05,841 --> 02:46:08,769
TRAVIS: I would love to.

2240
02:46:08,769 --> 02:46:12,331
LAURA: Okay. And the third question?

2241
02:46:12,331 --> 02:46:20,984
TALIESIN: We move towards a conflict. What should
we know? What should we be prepared for?

2242
02:46:20,984 --> 02:46:25,725
MATT: Pulls the two cards forward, throws them
down, landing once again almost precisely on the

2243
02:46:25,725 --> 02:46:33,442
same space as the last two tosses. They slide to a
stop. One of them shows a chasm cracking in the

2244
02:46:33,442 --> 02:46:50,304
earth, and the other appears to show a singular,
sunken skull. "The path is to change historic, but

2245
02:46:50,304 --> 02:47:06,300
"many will fall as the transition is to take. Take
your time wisely, for the hourglass runs

2246
02:47:06,300 --> 02:47:09,871
"quickly."

2247
02:47:09,871 --> 02:47:14,837
LAURA: Goddamn it. Five more gold.

2248
02:47:14,837 --> 02:47:19,781
MATT: "Is this all of your questions?"

2249
02:47:19,781 --> 02:47:23,232
TALIESIN: That will do, yes.

2250
02:47:23,232 --> 02:47:33,817
MATT: He bows his head ever so slowly towards you.
"Then be pleased." And he takes the cards and

2251
02:47:33,817 --> 02:47:38,790
shuffles them back into the deck, rights them into
a perfect square with one quick move of his hand,

2252
02:47:38,790 --> 02:47:43,798
and places them back in front, puts his hands back
on his knees, and closes his eyes and puts his

2253
02:47:43,798 --> 02:47:49,884
head down. There's a pause, and he reaches over
and grabs a small, partially eaten apple and

2254
02:47:49,884 --> 02:47:51,765
(chomp).

2255
02:47:51,765 --> 02:48:02,519
LAURA: I as quietly as possible put another five
gold in front of him.

2256
02:48:02,519 --> 02:48:11,359
MATT: His chewing stops, and he swallows. Reaches
out, patting around it, and finds the gold coins.

2257
02:48:11,359 --> 02:48:24,487
Puts it into a pocket. "You ask for one more
question. What do you inquire?" (card shuffling)

2258
02:48:24,487 --> 02:48:34,780
LAURA: Did I make the right choice?

2259
02:48:34,780 --> 02:48:48,503
MATT: Two cards land across the carpet before you.
One of them shows upon it two hands joining, and

2260
02:48:48,503 --> 02:49:01,058
the other one shows a symbol of a sun rising over
a mountain range. He says, "You've made many

2261
02:49:01,058 --> 02:49:12,546
"choices, but the one you speak of brings unity and
a new dawn."

2262
02:49:12,546 --> 02:49:19,191
LAURA: Be pleased.

2263
02:49:19,191 --> 02:49:22,858
MATT: He nods. "Be pleased." Takes the cards up,
shuffles them back into the deck, and sets it

2264
02:49:22,858 --> 02:49:25,660
down. He goes back into his meditative trance.

2265
02:49:25,660 --> 02:49:28,531
TALIESIN: I feel that was money well spent.

2266
02:49:28,531 --> 02:49:30,099
MARISHA: I guess.

2267
02:49:30,099 --> 02:49:32,098
LAURA: That was so cool!

2268
02:49:32,098 --> 02:49:40,355
TALIESIN: Well, we know we do not necessarily look
for a man, which is important. We know that time

2269
02:49:40,355 --> 02:49:45,687
is even more of the essence than we first implied,
and considering that almost every soothsayer I've

2270
02:49:45,687 --> 02:49:50,855
ever met is as crooked as the day is long, the
word is now out that we're looking for them.

2271
02:49:50,855 --> 02:49:57,951
LAURA: Well, that's the Shade. Should we head that
direction?

2272
02:49:57,951 --> 02:49:59,321
TALIESIN: We should.

2273
02:49:59,321 --> 02:50:00,847
LAURA: Grog?

2274
02:50:00,847 --> 02:50:01,992
TRAVIS: Yeah?

2275
02:50:01,992 --> 02:50:04,531
LAURA: Do you want to bring your rock?

2276
02:50:04,531 --> 02:50:05,872
TRAVIS: My what?

2277
02:50:05,872 --> 02:50:10,038
TALIESIN: We should grab Scanlan.

2278
02:50:10,038 --> 02:50:12,856
LIAM: Where is he?

2279
02:50:12,856 --> 02:50:16,367
MATT: Scanlan is gone.

2280
02:50:16,367 --> 02:50:18,121
LIAM: Well, shit.

2281
02:50:18,121 --> 02:50:21,502
MARISHA: We need one of those leashes for him.

2282
02:50:21,502 --> 02:50:22,857
LIAM: Shorthalt?

2283
02:50:22,857 --> 02:50:27,251
TALIESIN: Let's maintain a certain level of
plausible deniability.

2284
02:50:27,251 --> 02:50:29,458
LAURA: Fuck.

2285
02:50:29,458 --> 02:50:39,656
MARISHA: I come over the earrings. Scanlan? Just
making sure you're okay, wondering where you are.

2286
02:50:39,656 --> 02:50:43,261
No biggie. Just checking in.

2287
02:50:43,261 --> 02:50:47,980
MATT: As you're walking with your half-elvish
friend down one of the nearby alleyways, you hear

2288
02:50:47,980 --> 02:50:49,991
Keyleth speaking over the earring.

2289
02:50:49,991 --> 02:50:55,582
SAM: I say: I'm cool.

2290
02:50:55,582 --> 02:51:03,909
TALIESIN: We're going to die. Let's get a room.

2291
02:51:03,909 --> 02:51:06,198
TRAVIS: All right.

2292
02:51:06,198 --> 02:51:08,127
MATT: So you guys make your way towards the
Shade?

2293
02:51:08,127 --> 02:51:13,877
LAURA: Yes. Scanlan, we're heading towards the
Shade. It's the big green tent. Follow?

2294
02:51:13,877 --> 02:51:16,662
SAM: (clicks tongue) Yeah.

2295
02:51:16,662 --> 02:51:22,995
MATT: Your half-elven compadre goes, "Are you all
right?"

2296
02:51:22,995 --> 02:51:30,461
SAM: I'm cool. I'm cool on these desert nights,
and I need something to warm me up at night, so

2297
02:51:30,461 --> 02:51:34,256
that's why I was inquiring about this spice.

2298
02:51:34,256 --> 02:51:38,198
MATT: "Please, which spice are you seeking?"

2299
02:51:38,198 --> 02:51:47,051
SAM: It might not be entirely legal, but fusaka?

2300
02:51:47,051 --> 02:51:58,362
MATT: He nods. "It may take a bit of time. I know
someone who could bring this, but I could not

2301
02:51:58,362 --> 02:52:00,578
"bring you to them. They'd have to bring it to
you."

2302
02:52:00,578 --> 02:52:02,764
SAM: Where can we meet?

2303
02:52:02,764 --> 02:52:04,807
MATT: "Well, where are you staying?"

2304
02:52:04,807 --> 02:52:12,789
SAM: I'm staying outside of the walls in a small
encampment, but I can meet him sometime tonight

2305
02:52:12,789 --> 02:52:14,522
inside the walls.

2306
02:52:14,522 --> 02:52:16,123
MATT: "Where would you need to meet?"

2307
02:52:16,123 --> 02:52:20,131
SAM: How about where we first met, at that same
intersection, or is that too busy?

2308
02:52:20,131 --> 02:52:24,292
MATT: "That is far too busy. It needs to be
private, away."

2309
02:52:24,292 --> 02:52:28,526
SAM: I'm sort of a visitor here.

2310
02:52:28,526 --> 02:52:35,886
MATT: "If you want a place to stay, there is
Luck's Run, the casino. There are back rooms there."

2311
02:52:35,886 --> 02:52:37,754
SAM: There's a casino?

2312
02:52:37,754 --> 02:52:38,925
MATT: "Yes."

2313
02:52:38,925 --> 02:52:40,209
SAM: Hells yes.

2314
02:52:40,209 --> 02:52:51,393
MATT: "There is the Debt's Respite Inn, which has
its own grasp of lowlifes. Those are probably the

2315
02:52:51,393 --> 02:52:53,012
"best bets."

2316
02:52:53,012 --> 02:52:55,791
SAM: Let's meet in a room at the casino.

2317
02:52:55,791 --> 02:53:00,365
MATT: "The casino it is. Which room?"

2318
02:53:00,365 --> 02:53:08,086
SAM: The red room? I'm not familiar with this
casino. I'll need some guidance.

2319
02:53:08,086 --> 02:53:13,466
MATT: "Wear a red shirt. He will find you in the
casino."

2320
02:53:13,466 --> 02:53:15,404
SAM: Okay. That sounds good.

2321
02:53:15,404 --> 02:53:19,455
MATT: "All right. Hour past sundown, we'll find
you there."

2322
02:53:19,455 --> 02:53:20,773
SAM: Tonight? What time?

2323
02:53:20,773 --> 02:53:22,341
MATT: "An hour past sundown."

2324
02:53:22,341 --> 02:53:26,890
SAM: Oh, sorry. I was thinking about the casino.
Sorry.

2325
02:53:26,890 --> 02:53:28,851
MATT: "How much do you want?"

2326
02:53:28,851 --> 02:53:31,562
SAM: Oh my god. I'm not prepared for this!

2327
02:53:31,562 --> 02:53:35,056
MATT: He starts looking a little untrusting.

2328
02:53:35,056 --> 02:53:37,267
TRAVIS: Be cool, man. Be cool.

2329
02:53:37,267 --> 02:53:46,085
SAM: Enough to get me through a week of heavy use.
I want to go on a bender.

2330
02:53:46,085 --> 02:53:50,670
MATT: Make a deception check.

2331
02:53:50,670 --> 02:53:57,058
SAM: A billion. More than before. 35.

2332
02:53:57,058 --> 02:53:59,129
TALIESIN: How are you rolling that?

2333
02:53:59,129 --> 02:54:01,635
MATT: He gives you a look and bends down.

2334
02:54:01,635 --> 02:54:06,476
SAM: I've had a rough few weeks, and I need to get
away from it all and go to that place--

2335
02:54:06,476 --> 02:54:12,235
MATT: He gets close to your face, interrupts you,
and goes, "I mean this with all due respect:

2336
02:54:12,235 --> 02:54:17,481
"Being as small a man as you are, you have to be
careful."

2337
02:54:17,481 --> 02:54:20,761
SAM: Don't tell me what to do. I can take it, all
right?

2338
02:54:20,761 --> 02:54:24,036
(laughter)

2339
02:54:24,036 --> 02:54:27,333
SAM: Let's just say that when I started using, I
was your height.

2340
02:54:27,333 --> 02:54:32,877
(laughter)

2341
02:54:32,877 --> 02:54:46,310
MATT: He backs off, hands up. He goes, "Very well.
The amount you ask, I have no specific amount. I'd

2342
02:54:46,310 --> 02:54:52,151
"have to inquire, but I would say, to be safe,
bring about 200 gold pieces with you. Just in case."

2343
02:54:52,151 --> 02:54:59,828
SAM: It'll be pure, not cut with anything else? I
want the good stuff.

2344
02:54:59,828 --> 02:55:03,307
MATT: He looks at you, confused.

2345
02:55:03,307 --> 02:55:06,882
SAM: Am I buying cinnamon here?

2346
02:55:06,882 --> 02:55:08,454
MARISHA: Might be.

2347
02:55:08,454 --> 02:55:09,924
TALIESIN: It's going to be a living baby.

2348
02:55:09,924 --> 02:55:12,790
SAM: It's going to be a pound of turmeric!

2349
02:55:12,790 --> 02:55:15,629
LIAM: Cardamom.

2350
02:55:15,629 --> 02:55:21,422
SAM: Yes. We have a deal. Let's shake on it.

2351
02:55:21,422 --> 02:55:28,843
MATT: He reaches out and takes your hand, and you
shake. "Very well. Hour after sundown. Casino." He

2352
02:55:28,843 --> 02:55:32,805
brings his cloth up and brings it up over his face
for a second and darts into one of the nearby

2353
02:55:32,805 --> 02:55:34,444
corners and vanishes.

2354
02:55:34,444 --> 02:55:36,601
SAM: Where did you guys go? Hello?

2355
02:55:36,601 --> 02:55:37,976
LAURA: We're at the Shade!

2356
02:55:37,976 --> 02:55:44,879
SAM: Okay! I'm coming! Where is that? Shit, where
am I? I ask around for the Shade.

2357
02:55:44,879 --> 02:55:46,519
MATT: You eventually find it.

2358
02:55:46,519 --> 02:55:49,230
MARISHA: Scanlan, stop panicking. I can hear you
hyperventilating.

2359
02:55:49,230 --> 02:55:51,923
SAM: I'm sorry, I've just never done anything that
cool before!

2360
02:55:51,923 --> 02:55:54,129
TALIESIN: And you still haven't.

2361
02:55:54,129 --> 02:55:55,945
LIAM: The hell you haven't!

2362
02:55:55,945 --> 02:55:58,243
SAM: I just did a drug deal, guys!

2363
02:55:58,243 --> 02:56:03,286
MARISHA: Scanlan, not over the speakers! Not over
the phone line!

2364
02:56:03,286 --> 02:56:05,070
LAURA: You have drugs with you?

2365
02:56:05,070 --> 02:56:06,759
SAM: No! I'll tell you later!

2366
02:56:06,759 --> 02:56:08,781
TALIESIN: These earrings are tapped. You know
that.

2367
02:56:08,781 --> 02:56:10,621
SAM: They could be listening! I'm coming to you!

2368
02:56:10,621 --> 02:56:12,261
LIAM: Pike hears everything.

2369
02:56:12,261 --> 02:56:15,216
(laughter)

2370
02:56:15,216 --> 02:56:22,758
MATT: You guys find your way to the Shade, and
it's a large, circular sandstone wall that has a

2371
02:56:22,758 --> 02:56:28,780
pointed tent roof above it held by a singular pole
in the center. It is segmented into various rooms

2372
02:56:28,780 --> 02:56:34,839
that have no ceiling, so everyone shares the same
roof. This is what appears to be a lounge tavern,

2373
02:56:34,839 --> 02:56:39,340
meaning there are drinks and wine served, but each
room seems to have a carpeted and pillowed floor.

2374
02:56:39,340 --> 02:56:44,083
Looks like there are beaded curtains and various
draperies that separate each of the different

2375
02:56:44,083 --> 02:56:52,304
rooms, and there's large, hookah-type tobacco
pipes. It's very much just a relaxing lounge area.

2376
02:56:52,304 --> 02:56:53,388
TALIESIN: There's hookah.

2377
02:56:53,388 --> 02:56:54,545
MARISHA: There's hookah!

2378
02:56:54,545 --> 02:56:55,789
TALIESIN: I've never tried hookah before.

2379
02:56:55,789 --> 02:56:57,193
MARISHA: You've never tried hookah?

2380
02:56:57,193 --> 02:56:58,987
TALIESIN: No.

2381
02:56:58,987 --> 02:57:01,431
MARISHA: The Earth Ashari are super into the
hookah. It's really nice, yeah.

2382
02:57:01,431 --> 02:57:05,392
TALIESIN: This is the only thing I actually know
about this continent, is that there's tobacco.

2383
02:57:05,392 --> 02:57:06,700
MARISHA: We should try it!

2384
02:57:06,700 --> 02:57:08,426
LAURA: Did Scanlan get here yet?

2385
02:57:08,426 --> 02:57:12,482
MATT: Scanlan takes about five minutes or so, but
eventually catches up to you guys.

2386
02:57:12,482 --> 02:57:17,687
LAURA: Are we staying here? It's not very
private.

2387
02:57:17,687 --> 02:57:23,776
TALIESIN: It's not very private, and privacy is
definitely higher on the list.

2388
02:57:23,776 --> 02:57:28,640
LAURA: Can I find a patron that seems chill?

2389
02:57:28,640 --> 02:57:34,908
MATT: Yeah. You look around. You can see what
looks to be a matronly older woman wearing some

2390
02:57:34,908 --> 02:57:41,513
nicer dark purple and black clothing, who is
sitting there with one big hookah next to her

2391
02:57:41,513 --> 02:57:47,001
side, by herself, with a glass of wine to one of
the sides, and is staring into space.

2392
02:57:47,001 --> 02:57:50,854
TALIESIN: I can literally only see my mother when
you describe this image, by the way.

2393
02:57:50,854 --> 02:57:53,816
(laughter)

2394
02:57:53,816 --> 02:57:58,970
TALIESIN: And only you and you know how funny that
is, because it's sealed in there.

2395
02:57:58,970 --> 02:58:02,924
LAURA: I walk up. Be pleased.

2396
02:58:02,924 --> 02:58:07,778
MATT: "Be pleased. Can I help you?"

2397
02:58:07,778 --> 02:58:11,920
LAURA: Actually, just a small trifle. Are you
staying here?

2398
02:58:11,920 --> 02:58:15,831
MATT: "Over the next few hours,
yes."

2399
02:58:15,831 --> 02:58:19,678
LAURA: Lovely. We're from out of town--

2400
02:58:19,678 --> 02:58:22,282
MATT: "You don't say."

2401
02:58:22,282 --> 02:58:29,493
LAURA: Yes, and I've noticed the Shade is rather
open. Do you know if the Corner Cove or Debt's

2402
02:58:29,493 --> 02:58:38,152
Respite are quite as private as this, or do they
have actual rooms?

2403
02:58:38,152 --> 02:58:40,491
MATT: "Both of those have rooms, yes."

2404
02:58:40,491 --> 02:58:41,784
LAURA: Oh. Lovely.

2405
02:58:41,784 --> 02:58:43,770
MATT: "Do you have any other specifics or
requirements?"

2406
02:58:43,770 --> 02:58:45,697
LAURA: Are they far from here?

2407
02:58:45,697 --> 02:58:52,521
MATT: "Corner Cove is maybe two miles that way,
but the Debt's Respite is about a mile that way."

2408
02:58:52,521 --> 02:58:54,617
LAURA: Thank you. Sorry to bother you.

2409
02:58:54,617 --> 02:58:57,329
TALIESIN: Should we put some cards on the table?

2410
02:58:57,329 --> 02:58:59,920
LAURA: Some cards?

2411
02:58:59,920 --> 02:59:02,765
MARISHA: I thought that's what we just did with
that other guy.

2412
02:59:02,765 --> 02:59:14,319
TALIESIN: We've been searching for a friend of
ours, and it's been very complicated. She's got

2413
02:59:14,319 --> 02:59:17,295
one eye. She's been around for quite a while.

2414
02:59:17,295 --> 02:59:19,858
LAURA: She's a merchant in town. We've been
looking for her.

2415
02:59:19,858 --> 02:59:23,618
MATT: "There are many merchants that live here."

2416
02:59:23,618 --> 02:59:25,366
TALIESIN: Are there many merchants with one eye?

2417
02:59:25,366 --> 02:59:27,160
LAURA: She's quite strong, actually.

2418
02:59:27,160 --> 02:59:31,905
MARISHA: Some call her a warrior merchant.

2419
02:59:31,905 --> 02:59:37,918
MATT: "Warrior? If you're looking for warrior
merchants, you're probably looking for the

2420
02:59:37,918 --> 02:59:39,486
"Scarbearers."

2421
02:59:39,486 --> 02:59:41,252
TALIESIN: Yes, that sounds about right.

2422
02:59:41,252 --> 02:59:45,157
LAURA: Yeah, she is a Scarbearer. Are they around
here?

2423
02:59:45,157 --> 02:59:50,067
MATT: "Well, this definitely narrows down your
search. The Debt's Respite is where you'll want to

2424
02:59:50,067 --> 02:59:54,678
"go. It's actually run by one of the heads of their
ilk."

2425
02:59:54,678 --> 02:59:56,449
MARISHA: Ilk?

2426
02:59:56,449 --> 02:59:58,349
TALIESIN: Not an animal.

2427
02:59:58,349 --> 03:00:00,893
MATT: "Scarbearers. They're a bit of a
rough-and-tumble lot."

2428
03:00:00,893 --> 03:00:02,216
LAURA: Oh, are they?

2429
03:00:02,216 --> 03:00:09,214
MATT: "They hunt for coin, sell what else they
find. Odd jobs. Some of them maybe not the most up

2430
03:00:09,214 --> 03:00:17,893
"and legal, but they work with a guarantee, and the
head of their troop I think runs, or at least

2431
03:00:17,893 --> 03:00:20,194
"partially owns, the Debt's Respite."

2432
03:00:20,194 --> 03:00:23,162
TALIESIN: Thank you. What are you smoking at the
moment, by the way?

2433
03:00:23,162 --> 03:00:25,201
MARISHA: I was just about to ask her the same
thing!

2434
03:00:25,201 --> 03:00:35,294
MATT: "This? I don't know." Raises her hand, and
one of the various workers there approaches with

2435
03:00:35,294 --> 03:00:37,061
another bottle of wine.

2436
03:00:37,061 --> 03:00:38,523
"Yes, may I help?"

2437
03:00:38,523 --> 03:00:43,863
"What is this you put in here?" Blows it in her
face.

2438
03:00:43,863 --> 03:00:55,005
"That would be a Dusk Blossom Sage." Walks away.

2439
03:00:55,005 --> 03:00:56,709
"Dusk Blossom Sage."

2440
03:00:56,709 --> 03:00:58,681
TALIESIN: It's very fragrant.

2441
03:00:58,681 --> 03:01:01,874
MATT: "Pungent would be the world you're looking
for."

2442
03:01:01,874 --> 03:01:05,110
LIAM: I walk over to Keyleth and say: I've done
this, but I don't think I knew what I was doing.

2443
03:01:05,110 --> 03:01:07,449
Your people do this?

2444
03:01:07,449 --> 03:01:10,453
MARISHA: Well, the Earth Ashari do, and the Fire
Ashari sometimes.

2445
03:01:10,453 --> 03:01:11,982
LIAM: You've done this.

2446
03:01:11,982 --> 03:01:19,160
MARISHA: Yeah. I stayed with the Earth Ashari for
a few months. You want to try? It's fun. It's very

2447
03:01:19,160 --> 03:01:23,301
nice. It relaxes you. Oh, come on guys! We've got
time!

2448
03:01:23,301 --> 03:01:24,663
LAURA: Do we?

2449
03:01:24,663 --> 03:01:28,009
MARISHA: We never take time for ourselves. Come
on!

2450
03:01:28,009 --> 03:01:30,577
LAURA: We've got a ticking time bomb!

2451
03:01:30,577 --> 03:01:32,612
MARISHA: Just 15 minutes!

2452
03:01:32,612 --> 03:01:38,027
TALIESIN: The cards said our luck. Perhaps this
is a good way to ignite it.

2453
03:01:38,027 --> 03:01:40,888
MARISHA: 15 minutes. Please, Vex, pretty please!

2454
03:01:40,888 --> 03:01:46,427
TALIESIN: We are still waiting for Scanlan to get
here, and then we'll take him to the next stop.

2455
03:01:46,427 --> 03:01:48,584
MATT: Scanlan, by the way, is right behind you.

2456
03:01:48,584 --> 03:01:49,514
SAM: Hi!

2457
03:01:49,514 --> 03:01:50,783
MARISHA: Scanlan!

2458
03:01:50,783 --> 03:01:54,979
SAM: Sorry. Didn't mean to sneak up on you.

2459
03:01:54,979 --> 03:01:57,067
LIAM: Now we really need to do it.

2460
03:01:57,067 --> 03:02:02,675
LAURA: We do need to talk to him, actually. Do you
mind if we join you? I motion to the waitress.

2461
03:02:02,675 --> 03:02:04,922
Could we have some more Dusk Sage?

2462
03:02:04,922 --> 03:02:06,448
TRAVIS: Something stronger.

2463
03:02:06,448 --> 03:02:13,683
MATT: You see her eyes roll. "I mean no offense,
but this is my 'me' time."

2464
03:02:13,683 --> 03:02:15,275
LAURA: Oh, of course!

2465
03:02:15,275 --> 03:02:18,805
MARISHA: Let's get our own! We'll get our own
little booth.

2466
03:02:18,805 --> 03:02:24,978
TALIESIN: I'm going to put a gold coin on her
tray. So you can keep smoking, and thank you for

2467
03:02:24,978 --> 03:02:27,032
the time spent in our company.

2468
03:02:27,032 --> 03:02:31,577
MATT: She takes the coin, flicks it back to you
and goes, "I appreciate, but do not require your

2469
03:02:31,577 --> 03:02:32,936
"patronage."

2470
03:02:32,936 --> 03:02:34,515
TALIESIN: I'm grateful for your time.

2471
03:02:34,515 --> 03:02:36,278
SAM: Yeah. I like her.

2472
03:02:36,278 --> 03:02:43,470
TALIESIN: Thanks, mom. It is burned into my head.

2473
03:02:43,470 --> 03:02:45,021
TRAVIS: Getting our own?

2474
03:02:45,021 --> 03:02:46,236
LAURA: Yeah, we go get our own.

2475
03:02:46,236 --> 03:02:51,582
MATT: You guys are brought into one of the small
sections of the Shade. You are given your choice

2476
03:02:51,582 --> 03:02:59,208
of various tobaccos. While it's not a large room,
per se, you can all comfortably lounge in there.

2477
03:02:59,208 --> 03:03:05,052
It's a nice place to get away. You can hear the
distant sounds of the city, but for the most part,

2478
03:03:05,052 --> 03:03:12,211
there's a soft violin music that plays towards the
center of the area, so at least it has a nice

2479
03:03:12,211 --> 03:03:13,966
atmosphere to it.

2480
03:03:13,966 --> 03:03:18,643
TRAVIS: As we're in there, do we notice anyone
with any large scars walking around?

2481
03:03:18,643 --> 03:03:21,399
MATT: Make a perception check.

2482
03:03:21,399 --> 03:03:26,167
TRAVIS: This'll go great. 12.

2483
03:03:26,167 --> 03:03:33,538
MATT: You see people with small, large scars.
People with scars all over. Life out here can be a

2484
03:03:33,538 --> 03:03:39,464
little tough at times, but no more scarred than
most of the people you've encountered in your

2485
03:03:39,464 --> 03:03:42,471
lifetime. And definitely nowhere near as scarred
as the people you've run with for half of your

2486
03:03:42,471 --> 03:03:44,091
lifetime.

2487
03:03:44,091 --> 03:03:48,295
TRAVIS: There are no really large, scarred people
in here.

2488
03:03:48,295 --> 03:03:50,090
LAURA: Good to know. Thank you, Grog.

2489
03:03:50,090 --> 03:03:52,187
TALIESIN and LAURA: Good to know.

2490
03:03:52,187 --> 03:03:54,636
LIAM: Hey, can I see that ruby you found before?

2491
03:03:54,636 --> 03:03:56,833
TRAVIS: I have no ruby.

2492
03:03:56,833 --> 03:03:58,848
LIAM: You'd hold out on me?

2493
03:03:58,848 --> 03:04:00,559
TRAVIS: Nope. There was no ruby.

2494
03:04:00,559 --> 03:04:01,814
LIAM: Why are you lying to me, Grog?

2495
03:04:01,814 --> 03:04:06,289
TRAVIS: Look, Little Teeny is my friend. All
right? He spoke to me out of the deserts of fate,

2496
03:04:06,289 --> 03:04:08,107
and he is mine and mine alone.

2497
03:04:08,107 --> 03:04:11,515
LIAM: All right.

2498
03:04:11,515 --> 03:04:14,523
LAURA: Scanlan.

2499
03:04:14,523 --> 03:04:15,548
SAM: Oi.

2500
03:04:15,548 --> 03:04:16,841
LAURA: Spice dealer?

2501
03:04:16,841 --> 03:04:18,480
MARISHA: Yes, I want to hear this story.

2502
03:04:18,480 --> 03:04:25,407
SAM: I made contact. I'm supposed to meet up
tonight in the casino one hour after sunset. I'm

2503
03:04:25,407 --> 03:04:31,596
supposed to wear red. I will not lie, I am
shitting myself, I'm so nervous.

2504
03:04:31,596 --> 03:04:33,429
LAURA: Are you going to wear red?

2505
03:04:33,429 --> 03:04:38,620
SAM: Well, how else will they discern who I am? I
don't want to go alone.

2506
03:04:38,620 --> 03:04:40,348
LAURA: Well, I'll go with you.

2507
03:04:40,348 --> 03:04:42,575
SAM: Are you cool?

2508
03:04:42,575 --> 03:04:44,408
LAURA: Of course I'm cool. I'm so cool, darling.

2509
03:04:44,408 --> 03:04:45,518
SAM: Okay.

2510
03:04:45,518 --> 03:04:46,768
TALIESIN: I'm cool!

2511
03:04:46,768 --> 03:04:47,849
MARISHA: Me, too!

2512
03:04:47,849 --> 03:04:48,892
SAM: Well...

2513
03:04:48,892 --> 03:04:50,913
TALIESIN: No, what do you mean? We're cool.

2514
03:04:50,913 --> 03:04:54,088
SAM: I don't want to draw too much attention, but
I want to be safe.

2515
03:04:54,088 --> 03:04:55,740
TRAVIS: (loudly) Are you buying drugs?

2516
03:04:55,740 --> 03:05:01,138
(laughter)

2517
03:05:01,138 --> 03:05:03,395
TALIESIN: Could not be happier.

2518
03:05:03,395 --> 03:05:05,581
LIAM: What an episode! What an episode.

2519
03:05:05,581 --> 03:05:08,647
TALIESIN: There's so many valuable lessons that
can be learned at any moment.

2520
03:05:08,647 --> 03:05:15,081
LAURA: Do you think maybe the reason Jarett was
almost arrested was because of this fucking spice?

2521
03:05:15,081 --> 03:05:17,913
TALIESIN: I think that's precisely what happened.

2522
03:05:17,913 --> 03:05:19,825
LAURA: What the hell was he thinking?

2523
03:05:19,825 --> 03:05:21,883
SAM: But we're going to do it smarter. We're going
to do it better.

2524
03:05:21,883 --> 03:05:26,304
TALIESIN: No, we're not! (laughs) He's
legitimately smarter than us.

2525
03:05:26,304 --> 03:05:29,035
SAM: I can do this. I am the one who cocks.

2526
03:05:29,035 --> 03:05:34,574
(laughter)

2527
03:05:34,574 --> 03:05:41,723
SAM: I can do this. But I need some backup. Maybe
Vax could come and he could wear red. And he could

2528
03:05:41,723 --> 03:05:43,113
be the guy who--

2529
03:05:43,113 --> 03:05:46,132
LAURA: Aren't they going to be looking for a very
little man?

2530
03:05:46,132 --> 03:05:48,287
SAM: Okay, I'll wear the red, but maybe you could
be there.

2531
03:05:48,287 --> 03:05:52,601
LIAM: I will go with you, and I will hang back,
and I will be there to stab out the eyes of anyone

2532
03:05:52,601 --> 03:05:56,556
who wants to hurt you, but you are the talker,
man. You've always been the talker.

2533
03:05:56,556 --> 03:05:58,209
SAM: Okay.

2534
03:05:58,209 --> 03:06:02,874
LAURA: Why does Scanlan never think I'm very cool?
Why does he think that?

2535
03:06:02,874 --> 03:06:04,446
SAM: No, I think you're great.

2536
03:06:04,446 --> 03:06:06,432
LAURA: You never want me to go with you, I
could've helped you find Kaylie, and you didn't

2537
03:06:06,432 --> 03:06:07,709
ask me to.

2538
03:06:07,709 --> 03:06:10,204
LIAM: Well, let's be real. She's the coolest one
in the group, really.

2539
03:06:10,204 --> 03:06:12,408
SAM: The big pointy hat, it's really dorky.

2540
03:06:12,408 --> 03:06:14,623
LAURA: You're the one who fucking makes me wear
this thing!

2541
03:06:14,623 --> 03:06:16,011
SAM: I know!

2542
03:06:16,011 --> 03:06:17,819
LIAM: Can she take it off at the casino, though?

2543
03:06:17,819 --> 03:06:20,940
LAURA: I'm not flying. I can take it off whenever
I fucking want!

2544
03:06:20,940 --> 03:06:25,033
TRAVIS: Can we all come? It sounds super
dangerous. I just want to watch. I'll be so sly.

2545
03:06:25,033 --> 03:06:27,573
TALIESIN: We are, by the way, walking to our next
destination.

2546
03:06:27,573 --> 03:06:30,735
MARISHA: No, I am enjoying my hookah.

2547
03:06:30,735 --> 03:06:32,215
TALIESIN: Oh, I forgot we got hookah. Oh my god.

2548
03:06:32,215 --> 03:06:35,152
LAURA: We're sitting and hookah-ing through this
whole fucking thing.

2549
03:06:35,152 --> 03:06:37,934
LIAM: I did it before, but I don't think I really
did it.

2550
03:06:37,934 --> 03:06:40,512
MARISHA: Is this a split hose? We have a split
hose.

2551
03:06:40,512 --> 03:06:45,197
SAM: No, thanks. I'm straight-edge tonight. I've
got to think clearly.

2552
03:06:45,197 --> 03:06:47,619
MARISHA: It's just tobacco, Scanlan.

2553
03:06:47,619 --> 03:06:50,800
TALIESIN: Is it just tobacco? We really don't
actually know.

2554
03:06:50,800 --> 03:06:55,838
MARISHA: Actually, that's a good point. I do a few
test puffs. Is it just tobacco? Is there something

2555
03:06:55,838 --> 03:06:57,345
special about this hookah?

2556
03:06:57,345 --> 03:06:59,542
MATT: It seems to be just delightfully flavored
tobacco.

2557
03:06:59,542 --> 03:07:06,836
MARISHA: It's nice! So okay, you don't want to
inhale all at once. It's more like flavor thing.

2558
03:07:06,836 --> 03:07:10,313
Like a cigar.

2559
03:07:10,313 --> 03:07:13,646
LIAM: Yeah. I copy Keyleth. (coughs)

2560
03:07:13,646 --> 03:07:15,538
MARISHA: Vax. Come on.

2561
03:07:15,538 --> 03:07:18,247
LAURA: Good job, brother. Good job.

2562
03:07:18,247 --> 03:07:20,259
TRAVIS: What happened to you?

2563
03:07:20,259 --> 03:07:33,546
LIAM: I just, (coughs, sniffs) I can't stop
(coughs) coughing. (coughs) I'm fine.

2564
03:07:33,546 --> 03:07:41,814
MARISHA: Wow. This is cute, actually. This is
adorable. I hand him some water from my pouch.

2565
03:07:41,814 --> 03:07:43,909
Just a little dry.

2566
03:07:43,909 --> 03:07:47,151
LIAM: (coughs) It's really good.

2567
03:07:47,151 --> 03:07:50,105
LAURA: Wow, you've never looked cooler in your
entire life.

2568
03:07:50,105 --> 03:07:52,155
LIAM: I agree with you.

2569
03:07:52,155 --> 03:07:55,405
TRAVIS: Is there a bar in this place? A proper
bar?

2570
03:07:55,405 --> 03:08:01,105
MATT: Not really a bar. It seems the servants take
orders and bring you your various liquid

2571
03:08:01,105 --> 03:08:02,195
imbibements.

2572
03:08:02,195 --> 03:08:04,927
TRAVIS: Right. Can I flag down a--

2573
03:08:05,043 --> 03:08:13,241
MATT: Yeah. You see a man walks up to you, long
dark curly hair, bit of a goatee growing. "How

2574
03:08:13,241 --> 03:08:14,630
"can I help you?"

2575
03:08:14,630 --> 03:08:23,942
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm royalty from a far-off land. I
pride myself on trying the fiercest spirit in the

2576
03:08:23,942 --> 03:08:28,121
area that I'm visiting. What do you guys pride
yourself on?

2577
03:08:28,121 --> 03:08:32,139
MATT: "You want the Sandkheg's Hide."

2578
03:08:32,139 --> 03:08:34,451
TRAVIS: The sandcake side?

2579
03:08:34,451 --> 03:08:36,736
MATT: "The Sandkheg's Hide."

2580
03:08:36,736 --> 03:08:39,567
TRAVIS: Oh, hide. Oh, is it a food or a drink?

2581
03:08:39,567 --> 03:08:40,609
MATT: "It's a drink."

2582
03:08:40,609 --> 03:08:42,434
TRAVIS: Yeah, then one of those'd be great.

2583
03:08:42,434 --> 03:08:43,752
MATT: "It's expensive."

2584
03:08:43,752 --> 03:08:53,739
TRAVIS: Yeah, well, don't tell anybody but I'm
super fucking rich. Only because I have to check

2585
03:08:53,739 --> 03:08:56,499
with my national treasury, how much is it?

2586
03:08:56,499 --> 03:08:58,747
MATT: "Ah, do you wish to have a glass or a
bottle?"

2587
03:08:58,747 --> 03:09:00,983
TRAVIS: A bottle.

2588
03:09:00,983 --> 03:09:04,372
MATT: "A bottle will run you 350 gold pieces."

2589
03:09:04,372 --> 03:09:05,736
SAM: Oh!

2590
03:09:05,736 --> 03:09:07,989
TRAVIS: I'll take two.

2591
03:09:07,989 --> 03:09:12,634
MATT: Walks off.

2592
03:09:12,634 --> 03:09:15,123
TALIESIN: How have we not stopped this?!

2593
03:09:15,123 --> 03:09:17,567
MATT: Comes back with two very full-- (laughs)

2594
03:09:17,567 --> 03:09:19,593
LAURA: That's from your personal fucking funds!

2595
03:09:19,593 --> 03:09:22,039
TRAVIS: We be clubbing, motherfuckers.

2596
03:09:22,039 --> 03:09:23,467
LAURA: That ain't no party funds.

2597
03:09:23,467 --> 03:09:26,377
TALIESIN: Those are gold coins. You're not making
it rain, you're making it hail, for god's sakes.

2598
03:09:26,377 --> 03:09:30,837
MARISHA: Does that get to come with us, or is it
bottle service? Because if this is bottle service,

2599
03:09:30,837 --> 03:09:32,362
we're here for the night.

2600
03:09:32,362 --> 03:09:35,794
TRAVIS: Okay, maybe there's champagne though,
yes?

2601
03:09:35,794 --> 03:09:42,829
MATT: He comes back a little later with these two
dark green glass wine bottles that have this

2602
03:09:42,829 --> 03:09:50,125
heavy leather wrapped around them and bolted
together at certain places. It looks like leather

2603
03:09:50,125 --> 03:09:55,219
at times, but as you get closer, you feel it's
actually hard. It's almost like a chitinous armor

2604
03:09:55,219 --> 03:09:58,364
on the outside of the glass.

2605
03:09:58,364 --> 03:10:00,129
TRAVIS: This was meant for me.

2606
03:10:00,129 --> 03:10:06,517
MATT: Both of these vials are given to you with
heavy corks that are wax-coated over the top.

2607
03:10:06,517 --> 03:10:09,485
"Here you are."

2608
03:10:09,485 --> 03:10:23,574
TRAVIS: Oh! May I start a tab? No? Fine. Then I
give, shit. (mutters) How much do I owe?

2609
03:10:23,574 --> 03:10:25,198
LAURA: 700.

2610
03:10:25,198 --> 03:10:30,575
TRAVIS 700. Here's 800 gold.

2611
03:10:30,575 --> 03:10:32,417
SAM: Oh my god.

2612
03:10:32,417 --> 03:10:36,186
MATT: "Thank you very much, and please, do let me
know if you require anything else."

2613
03:10:36,186 --> 03:10:38,268
TRAVIS: No problems.

2614
03:10:38,268 --> 03:10:40,363
MATT: And he exits the room.

2615
03:10:40,363 --> 03:10:43,543
TALIESIN: I have never hated you so much before,
in my entire life.

2616
03:10:43,543 --> 03:10:45,618
TRAVIS: Prepare to drink like kings.

2617
03:10:45,618 --> 03:10:48,557
LIAM: I feel the opposite way. I'm very proud.

2618
03:10:48,557 --> 03:10:52,266
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah. Grog, I think this bottle's
more well-armored than we are.

2619
03:10:52,266 --> 03:10:57,767
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's like amazing animal-skin
Maker's Mark. So how do we crack this bitch open?

2620
03:10:57,767 --> 03:11:02,029
SAM: Guys, I need you to be clear-headed tonight!

2621
03:11:02,029 --> 03:11:08,122
TALIESIN: I'm having a glass of this. We've just
paid a fortune for it.

2622
03:11:08,122 --> 03:11:09,434
LAURA: We're saving a bottle.

2623
03:11:09,434 --> 03:11:11,171
TALIESIN: We are saving a bottle.

2624
03:11:11,171 --> 03:11:15,262
TRAVIS: Right. Are there any opening utensils
around, because I don't want to unsheathe--

2625
03:11:15,262 --> 03:11:16,846
TALIESIN: May I sword it?

2626
03:11:16,846 --> 03:11:17,893
MATT: You may.

2627
03:11:17,893 --> 03:11:19,089
TALIESIN: I'm going to sword it.

2628
03:11:19,089 --> 03:11:21,638
LAURA: But don't take your sword out, because
we're not allowed to bring our weapons out.

2629
03:11:21,638 --> 03:11:23,619
TALIESIN: Oh, there's no weapon in here?

2630
03:11:23,619 --> 03:11:25,028
MATT: You're currently private in the room.

2631
03:11:25,028 --> 03:11:26,940
TALIESIN: Oh, we're private in the room.

2632
03:11:26,940 --> 03:11:29,783
MARISHA: I thought this was an open tent-commune
thing.

2633
03:11:29,783 --> 03:11:35,030
MATT: It's an open ceiling, but there are rooms
segmented by cloth and what looks like sandstone

2634
03:11:35,030 --> 03:11:39,380
walls, so there are little pockets and alcoves,
and you guys currently have one that you're in

2635
03:11:39,380 --> 03:11:40,572
right now.

2636
03:11:40,572 --> 03:11:43,572
TALIESIN: It's not no weapons, it's just no usage
of them.

2637
03:11:43,572 --> 03:11:46,500
LIAM: Let's keep them sheathed, he said at the
gate. But we are pretty hidden.

2638
03:11:46,500 --> 03:11:47,932
TALIESIN: I'll just pop it.

2639
03:11:47,932 --> 03:11:54,583
MATT: Comes off, and the cork flies and bounces
off one of the nearby walls. The smell that comes to

2640
03:11:54,583 --> 03:12:07,204
you is extremely strong. It resembles a very
vinegar turned wine mixed with this, for lack of a

2641
03:12:07,204 --> 03:12:13,732
better term, a very earthy scent. It's almost
herbal, medicinal. It's not at all what you would

2642
03:12:13,732 --> 03:12:15,627
have expected for something so expensive.

2643
03:12:15,627 --> 03:12:18,423
TRAVIS: Who wants to be first? Keyleth?

2644
03:12:18,423 --> 03:12:21,568
MARISHA: Fill me up. Oh wait, you want me to go
first?

2645
03:12:21,568 --> 03:12:22,723
LAURA: I want a shot.

2646
03:12:22,723 --> 03:12:23,833
TRAVIS: You want a shot?

2647
03:12:23,833 --> 03:12:25,541
SAM: Percival just took some.

2648
03:12:25,541 --> 03:12:32,027
MATT: As it touches your tongue, that smell
transitions into a very acidic taste. It actually

2649
03:12:32,027 --> 03:12:37,382
burns your tongue, and it goes numb within a
matter of seconds. It is not a delightful flavor,

2650
03:12:37,382 --> 03:12:41,224
and as the tongue goes numb, the back of the
throat goes numb as you swallow. As the numbness

2651
03:12:41,224 --> 03:12:48,779
continues down the rest of the body, the flavor
has not improved at all, but it brings this

2652
03:12:48,779 --> 03:12:56,755
universal numbness. And as the slight pain of the
burn subsides, you, with just but a few sips,

2653
03:12:56,755 --> 03:13:03,713
become extremely intoxicated, but also just numb.

2654
03:13:03,713 --> 03:13:06,982
LIAM and MARISHA: How is it?

2655
03:13:06,982 --> 03:13:08,902
TALIESIN: (slurring) Not very good.

2656
03:13:08,902 --> 03:13:10,421
LAURA: Oh shit.

2657
03:13:10,421 --> 03:13:12,849
TALIESIN: (slurring) But if--

2658
03:13:12,849 --> 03:13:15,627
LAURA: Oh, he's fucking wasted.

2659
03:13:15,627 --> 03:13:17,691
MARISHA: I slap him.

2660
03:13:17,691 --> 03:13:24,026
TALIESIN: (slurring) You should do that again.
That felt really good. I'll do it.

2661
03:13:24,026 --> 03:13:26,114
LAURA: Oh shit.

2662
03:13:26,114 --> 03:13:27,735
SAM: Liquid MDMA.

2663
03:13:27,735 --> 03:13:29,627
MARISHA: I take a sip.

2664
03:13:29,627 --> 03:13:31,859
LAURA: I'm not drinking mine. Here, Grog.

2665
03:13:31,859 --> 03:13:33,804
MARISHA: I want to know! I take a sip.

2666
03:13:33,804 --> 03:13:43,448
MATT: You take a sip, and the same sensation
takes, and the numbness sets in, this

2667
03:13:43,448 --> 03:13:50,365
slight vibration at the back of the skull.
Elements of this remind you of being very drunk,

2668
03:13:50,365 --> 03:13:52,186
with but a few sips.

2669
03:13:52,186 --> 03:13:56,822
LIAM: Hey, can you hear me? Yeah? You all right?

2670
03:13:56,822 --> 03:13:58,989
MARISHA: (slurring) Oh holy shit.

2671
03:13:58,989 --> 03:14:00,573
MARISHA and TALIESIN: (slurring) This is so
weird.

2672
03:14:00,573 --> 03:14:12,181
MARISHA: (laughs)

2673
03:14:12,181 --> 03:14:15,303
TALIESIN: (slurring) We're good.

2674
03:14:15,303 --> 03:14:17,512
LIAM: I take them by the cheeks. Can you feel
this?

2675
03:14:17,512 --> 03:14:19,150
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Yeah!

2676
03:14:19,150 --> 03:14:20,323
LIAM: You can?

2677
03:14:20,323 --> 03:14:21,533
MARISHA: (affirmative grunt)

2678
03:14:21,533 --> 03:14:22,629
LIAM: Can you feel this?

2679
03:14:22,629 --> 03:14:23,776
TALIESIN and MARISHA: (affirmative grunt)

2680
03:14:23,776 --> 03:14:24,882
TRAVIS: Does it taste good?

2681
03:14:24,882 --> 03:14:26,663
TALIESIN and MARISHA: (dissenting grunt)

2682
03:14:26,663 --> 03:14:28,502
LIAM: Do you recommend it?

2683
03:14:28,502 --> 03:14:30,017
TALIESIN and MARISHA: (non-committal grunt)

2684
03:14:30,017 --> 03:14:38,402
(laughter)

2685
03:14:38,402 --> 03:14:40,920
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) It hurts man, oh my god!

2686
03:14:40,920 --> 03:14:43,348
LAURA: Are you going to try it, Grog?

2687
03:14:43,348 --> 03:14:47,222
(laughter)

2688
03:14:47,222 --> 03:14:54,966
LIAM: I am not going to have a sip of that right
now. Definitely sometime, but--

2689
03:14:54,966 --> 03:14:56,040
LAURA: Back in the mansion, maybe.

2690
03:14:56,040 --> 03:14:57,093
LIAM: Yeah.

2691
03:14:57,093 --> 03:14:59,028
LAURA: But not when we have to do something
tonight.

2692
03:14:59,028 --> 03:15:00,277
TALIESIN: (slurring) What do we have to do?

2693
03:15:00,277 --> 03:15:02,419
LAURA: As charming as you two are right now.

2694
03:15:02,419 --> 03:15:07,511
TRAVIS: I'm going to stopper it and then I'm going
to put the extra bottle in the Bag of Holding.

2695
03:15:07,511 --> 03:15:09,199
SAM: You didn't have any?

2696
03:15:09,199 --> 03:15:10,614
TRAVIS: Nope.

2697
03:15:10,614 --> 03:15:12,060
LIAM: Just these two?

2698
03:15:12,060 --> 03:15:15,264
TRAVIS: (laughing) Money well spent!

2699
03:15:15,264 --> 03:15:18,634
LAURA: Can I step out and find that waiter that we
paid for?

2700
03:15:18,634 --> 03:15:21,441
LIAM: Yeah, you're both really cute right now, but
you're useless.

2701
03:15:21,441 --> 03:15:24,412
MARISHA: I lean on Vax a little bit.

2702
03:15:24,412 --> 03:15:29,828
LAURA: Wonderful beverages you just served us. How
long does that last?

2703
03:15:29,828 --> 03:15:33,326
MATT: "Depends on how much you're drinking."

2704
03:15:33,326 --> 03:15:36,191
LAURA: Just a tiny bit.

2705
03:15:36,191 --> 03:15:37,538
MATT: "Hour, maybe."

2706
03:15:37,538 --> 03:15:42,007
LAURA: Fabulous. They came with quite a price tag,
didn't they?

2707
03:15:42,007 --> 03:15:45,767
MATT: "'It's very dangerous to harvest and create,
yes."

2708
03:15:45,767 --> 03:15:50,588
LAURA: I could assume. What exactly is in?

2709
03:15:50,588 --> 03:15:52,474
LIAM: Yes, what are they harvested from?

2710
03:15:52,474 --> 03:15:57,609
MATT: He thinks a minute, then goes, "I don't know
which part of the sandkheg it is, but it is taken

2711
03:15:57,609 --> 03:16:03,119
"from the usually venomous bile or spittle of the
creature."

2712
03:16:03,119 --> 03:16:05,203
TALIESIN: (slurring) That's really good bile!

2713
03:16:05,203 --> 03:16:07,900
TRAVIS: It's a living thing.

2714
03:16:07,900 --> 03:16:12,226
LAURA: I'm assuming, I mean, back in the city that
we're from--

2715
03:16:12,226 --> 03:16:17,605
MATT: "Mind you, it is refined and pickled by the
finest of various-- It is a delicacy across

2716
03:16:17,605 --> 03:16:24,161
"Ank'Harel and northern areas of Marquet. I was
merely fulfilling the request of your companion.

2717
03:16:24,161 --> 03:16:27,500
TALIESIN: (slurring) No, it's very good.

2718
03:16:27,500 --> 03:16:34,138
LAURA: Thank you so much. Where we're from,
usually when purchasing such a great and expensive

2719
03:16:34,138 --> 03:16:40,811
item, room service is included. I'm assuming we
have somewhere to stay for the night?

2720
03:16:40,811 --> 03:16:46,217
TALIESIN: (slurring) I don't think that it's that
kind of place.

2721
03:16:46,217 --> 03:16:53,567
MATT: "I mean, you are welcome to stay, should you
pay an evening price, yes, but that is not part of

2722
03:16:53,567 --> 03:16:56,141
"the price of the drink of which you have
purchased, no."

2723
03:16:56,141 --> 03:17:00,000
LAURA: Oh. Cultural differences! Good to know.

2724
03:17:00,000 --> 03:17:03,837
TALIESIN: (slurring) We have to move.

2725
03:17:03,837 --> 03:17:07,618
LIAM: Hey. Can you say your full name right now?

2726
03:17:07,618 --> 03:17:13,445
TALIESIN: (slurred) Percival Fredrickstein von
Musel Klossowski de Rolo the third of Whitestone.

2727
03:17:13,445 --> 03:17:16,149
SAM: Don't say the W word!

2728
03:17:16,149 --> 03:17:17,472
TALIESIN: (slurring) Whitestone?

2729
03:17:17,472 --> 03:17:19,118
SAM: Okay, it's fine now.

2730
03:17:19,118 --> 03:17:22,146
TALIESIN: (slurring) What? (shushing)

2731
03:17:22,146 --> 03:17:25,195
TRAVIS: How long until you have to meet this guy
at the casino?

2732
03:17:25,195 --> 03:17:27,229
TALIESIN: (slurring) Why're you talking? Just
(shushes).

2733
03:17:27,229 --> 03:17:30,862
SAM: What time is it? Has the sun gone down?

2734
03:17:30,862 --> 03:17:35,708
MATT: No, you guys woke up maybe two and a half
hours ago.

2735
03:17:35,708 --> 03:17:37,523
TALIESIN: Day drinking! Yes!

2736
03:17:37,523 --> 03:17:42,411
MATT: You're maybe getting close to noon. The sun,
last you saw before you got here, was close to the

2737
03:17:42,411 --> 03:17:46,250
center of the sky.

2738
03:17:46,250 --> 03:17:48,402
TRAVIS: Well, we've got time to kill, right?

2739
03:17:48,402 --> 03:17:54,125
LAURA: We need to go find the Debt's Respite and
maybe get a room.

2740
03:17:54,125 --> 03:17:57,113
SAM: Is that where we're going to sleep tonight?

2741
03:17:57,113 --> 03:18:00,622
LAURA: That's where the Scarbearers are. We can
get a room here.

2742
03:18:00,622 --> 03:18:03,801
LIAM: And your deal is this evening, yes?

2743
03:18:03,801 --> 03:18:05,418
SAM: Yeah, we've got some time for that.

2744
03:18:05,418 --> 03:18:07,614
TRAVIS: So we take off for the Debt's Respite.

2745
03:18:07,614 --> 03:18:11,265
MATT: Okay. Who's leading the charge for that?

2746
03:18:11,265 --> 03:18:16,106
TRAVIS: No, you're not. I will.

2747
03:18:16,106 --> 03:18:19,483
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make an investigation
check, if you don't mind.

2748
03:18:19,483 --> 03:18:21,679
SAM: Investigation. You're terrible at those.

2749
03:18:21,679 --> 03:18:23,616
MARISHA: (laughing) This is everything I wanted.

2750
03:18:23,616 --> 03:18:25,611
TALIESIN: I'm so happy right now.

2751
03:18:25,611 --> 03:18:27,523
LAURA: 26.

2752
03:18:27,523 --> 03:18:34,171
MATT: 26 investigation check. Within ten minutes
you've asked the right questions between a number

2753
03:18:34,171 --> 03:18:42,675
of various street urchins and street salespersons,
to be directed straight towards the <i>Debt's</i> Respite.

2754
03:18:42,675 --> 03:18:45,240
SAM: I wrote it down correctly, Matt.

2755
03:18:45,240 --> 03:18:52,371
MATT: In following the direction, you end up
walking up to what looks like a rather

2756
03:18:52,371 --> 03:18:59,501
rundown-looking establishment. The broken glass
windows and missing front door lead you to think

2757
03:18:59,501 --> 03:19:05,586
that perhaps it's been abandoned for months. Looks
a little rough and ramshackle.

2758
03:19:05,654 --> 03:19:10,890
LAURA: But they said this was being guarded by the
Hand of Ord. Interesting.

2759
03:19:10,890 --> 03:19:17,866
SAM: My contact in the underworld said that this
was a place that is a known hangout for seedy

2760
03:19:17,866 --> 03:19:21,906
types. Right? Am I remembering that correctly?

2761
03:19:21,906 --> 03:19:25,353
LAURA: No, the guard at the front of the city told
us this was one of the places that you could stay,

2762
03:19:25,353 --> 03:19:27,308
and it was guarded.

2763
03:19:27,308 --> 03:19:31,967
MATT: He said it was a place you could stay,
because you were asking for taverns and inns.

2764
03:19:31,967 --> 03:19:35,053
LIAM: We have accounts from two different people,
and they're two different opinions.

2765
03:19:35,053 --> 03:19:39,406
TALIESIN: It's like Yelp. But better. I'm going to
knock. (knocking)

2766
03:19:39,406 --> 03:19:43,575
MATT: As you approach the front door, it's
partially ajar and as you push it open, you can see

2767
03:19:43,575 --> 03:19:48,532
the inside is a whole different story. As your
eyes adjust to the interior you find actually a

2768
03:19:48,532 --> 03:19:54,566
bustling business of barhands slinging tankards
across seven stained wood tables, some of the folk

2769
03:19:54,566 --> 03:19:59,906
look rather day-drunk, similar to these
individuals, though it has worn a bit off since

2770
03:19:59,906 --> 03:20:07,007
the original sip. And most look to be various
miscreants or post-work farmers taking a break.

2771
03:20:07,007 --> 03:20:15,560
The interior is familiar and probably closer to
the taverns you're used to in more of the poorer

2772
03:20:15,560 --> 03:20:20,267
districts of Emon and surrounding cities than some
of the more luxurious areas you've recently found

2773
03:20:20,267 --> 03:20:27,934
yourselves in. Vax, Vex, and Keyleth-- actually,
Keyleth, make a perception check with

2774
03:20:27,934 --> 03:20:30,177
disadvantage.

2775
03:20:30,177 --> 03:20:35,493
MARISHA: Aw. I see why you're doing that. With
disadvantage?

2776
03:20:35,493 --> 03:20:36,855
MATT: Yes.

2777
03:20:36,855 --> 03:20:38,001
MARISHA: 17.

2778
03:20:38,001 --> 03:20:48,209
MATT: Okay. Vex and Vax, as you guys walk into the
room, you do catch off in the distance behind a

2779
03:20:48,209 --> 03:20:54,560
series of barrels that are stacked and the edge of
a shelf that contains rows and rows of glasses,

2780
03:20:54,560 --> 03:21:00,811
tankards, plates, and various things. You just
barely make out what looks to be an androgynous

2781
03:21:00,811 --> 03:21:08,126
figure, face masked with dark blue and black
cloth, with a hint of leather armor, hiding in the

2782
03:21:08,126 --> 03:21:14,773
corner. Like barely visible to you and you can
make out the details due to your very keen ability

2783
03:21:14,773 --> 03:21:18,058
to gather your surroundings quickly.

2784
03:21:18,058 --> 03:21:21,767
LIAM: Is the armor similar to that suit of armor
we saw on the other guy?

2785
03:21:21,767 --> 03:21:24,930
MATT: Nope. This is very muddled, low leather
armor.

2786
03:21:24,930 --> 03:21:26,979
LAURA: Are they wearing a cloak?

2787
03:21:26,979 --> 03:21:31,146
MATT: Can't tell; their back's hidden, and they're
quiet.

2788
03:21:31,146 --> 03:21:34,179
LAURA: So they don't have something up? Do they
have a hood over their head?

2789
03:21:34,179 --> 03:21:37,157
MATT: They have a hood and a mask. Looks to be
like a cloth mask wrapped around him.

2790
03:21:37,157 --> 03:21:43,461
LIAM: I'm going to hang by the two sobering-up
twins over here and keep an eye on that person.

2791
03:21:43,461 --> 03:21:47,129
MATT: You guys also watch throughout all the
various patrons and people that are wandering

2792
03:21:47,129 --> 03:21:53,353
about this establishment, one figure stands out
amongst the others. You see a bronze-scaled

2793
03:21:53,353 --> 03:22:00,504
dragonborn: bulky and thick, muscular armored in
light hides and bracers. He clutches an untouched

2794
03:22:00,504 --> 03:22:09,145
mug that is brimming with an amber-colored ale and
is lost in thought, staring off towards one of the

2795
03:22:09,145 --> 03:22:15,151
broken windows that leads outside. Very heavy,
muscular arms. Maybe not quite the height of Grog,

2796
03:22:15,151 --> 03:22:16,963
but definitely a similar build.

2797
03:22:16,963 --> 03:22:19,146
LAURA: Tail or no tail?

2798
03:22:19,146 --> 03:22:21,207
MATT: Sitting down, you can't tell.

2799
03:22:21,207 --> 03:22:22,816
LIAM: You don't know.

2800
03:22:22,816 --> 03:22:27,464
MATT: What do you guys do?

2801
03:22:27,464 --> 03:22:30,749
TALIESIN: (slurring) We're fine.

2802
03:22:30,749 --> 03:22:34,588
LAURA: Wow. I guess I walk up to the
tavernkeep.

2803
03:22:34,588 --> 03:22:42,160
MATT: There is no tavernkeep. There are barmaids
walking around and passing drinks, but there is no

2804
03:22:42,160 --> 03:22:43,363
barkeep right now.

2805
03:22:43,363 --> 03:22:46,337
LAURA: I grab one of the barmaids. Who do we speak
to about a room?

2806
03:22:46,337 --> 03:22:51,850
MATT: "You would speak to Treev," and points to
the dragonborn, who is currently staring out of

2807
03:22:51,850 --> 03:22:53,254
the window.

2808
03:22:53,254 --> 03:22:55,216
LAURA: Oh. Well, there we go. I walk over.

2809
03:22:55,216 --> 03:22:57,059
TRAVIS: I go with her.

2810
03:22:57,059 --> 03:23:03,168
MATT: He's spacing out. As soon as you approach he
goes, (groans) "What do you want, bothering a

2811
03:23:03,168 --> 03:23:05,171
"fellow in mid-fantasy?"

2812
03:23:05,171 --> 03:23:07,164
LAURA: Sorry, sir.

2813
03:23:07,164 --> 03:23:11,201
MATT: "What can I do for you?"

2814
03:23:11,201 --> 03:23:15,865
LAURA: We're interested in a room for the night,
actually.

2815
03:23:15,865 --> 03:23:19,421
MATT: "All right, well, what's your name?"

2816
03:23:19,421 --> 03:23:21,788
LAURA: Vex'ahlia.

2817
03:23:21,788 --> 03:23:28,491
MATT: "Vex'ahlia. Treev. Treev Bonebreaker." And
grabs your arm. As opposed to a handshake, like a

2818
03:23:28,491 --> 03:23:39,057
full-on forearm, meaty grasp. Treev. T-R-E-E-V.
"Treev Bonebreaker. Current caretaker of this fine

2819
03:23:39,057 --> 03:23:43,332
"establishment. Looking for rooms? I've got three
available."

2820
03:23:43,332 --> 03:23:47,406
LAURA: Wonderful. Mind if I sit down?

2821
03:23:47,406 --> 03:23:54,725
MATT: "At this rate, sure. I doubt I'm going to
find myself back to that dream. Anyway, what do

2822
03:23:54,725 --> 03:23:58,764
"you and your rather scrawny-looking friend there
have to say?"

2823
03:23:58,764 --> 03:24:02,210
TRAVIS: I look around.

2824
03:24:02,210 --> 03:24:07,465
LAURA: We're actually here on a rather important
mission from Emon.

2825
03:24:07,465 --> 03:24:10,457
MATT: "Never been there."

2826
03:24:10,457 --> 03:24:15,768
LAURA: It <i>was</i> quite a beautiful city. Not as
much anymore.

2827
03:24:15,768 --> 03:24:21,404
MATT: "Well, that's unfortunate. Sometimes cities
fall to the lowest despots. It happens."

2828
03:24:21,404 --> 03:24:23,012
LAURA: Yes, it does.

2829
03:24:23,012 --> 03:24:24,836
MATT: "Rooms?"

2830
03:24:24,836 --> 03:24:28,987
LAURA: Yes. Three, you said?

2831
03:24:28,987 --> 03:24:30,605
MATT: "Three rooms available."

2832
03:24:30,605 --> 03:24:32,499
LAURA: And how much would those rooms be?

2833
03:24:32,499 --> 03:24:34,105
MATT: "How many are staying?"

2834
03:24:34,105 --> 03:24:37,456
SAM: Six.

2835
03:24:37,456 --> 03:24:38,838
LAURA: Six of us?

2836
03:24:38,838 --> 03:24:40,961
MATT: "And your bear?"

2837
03:24:40,961 --> 03:24:45,712
LAURA: Well, yes, but he doesn't take up much
space.

2838
03:24:45,712 --> 03:24:50,549
MATT: "Well we have to put a bear tax on this, you
realize."

2839
03:24:50,549 --> 03:24:51,989
LAURA: "A bear tax?"

2840
03:24:51,989 --> 03:24:55,473
MATT: "Yes. I haven't had a bear here before. Who
knows what damage it can do? Consider it protection."

2841
03:24:55,473 --> 03:24:59,930
LAURA: You know what? He can sleep outside, don't
worry. Don't worry about the bear.

2842
03:24:59,930 --> 03:25:03,520
MATT: "All right. I take no responsibility what
happens to your bear outside."

2843
03:25:03,520 --> 03:25:05,212
LAURA: Thank you.

2844
03:25:05,212 --> 03:25:08,537
MATT: "That'll run you ten gold per room. 30 gold
for the night."

2845
03:25:08,537 --> 03:25:15,182
LAURA: (whispers) Ten gold? (louder) Are these
really fancy rooms, then?

2846
03:25:15,182 --> 03:25:19,042
MATT: "No. God no. I don't know where you're from
in Emon or what the prices are there, but here,

2847
03:25:19,042 --> 03:25:21,139
"it's expensive."

2848
03:25:21,139 --> 03:25:23,633
LAURA: Every fucking thing is expensive here.

2849
03:25:23,633 --> 03:25:29,005
TALIESIN: Can I attempt to start looking around
the room to try and find anything interesting and

2850
03:25:29,005 --> 03:25:30,612
try and be useful?

2851
03:25:30,612 --> 03:25:32,695
MATT: Make an investigation check with
disadvantage.

2852
03:25:32,695 --> 03:25:35,893
LAURA: Can I insight and see if he's just taking
fucking advantage of us because we're tourists? I

2853
03:25:35,893 --> 03:25:41,193
don't want to roll that one. I want to roll this
one.

2854
03:25:41,193 --> 03:25:43,192
TALIESIN: Investigation? 12.

2855
03:25:43,192 --> 03:25:44,928
LAURA: Natural 20!

2856
03:25:44,928 --> 03:25:47,034
MARISHA: Oh shit.

2857
03:25:47,034 --> 03:25:51,150
MATT: Yeah, he straight-up jacked the price up. He
can see the foreigner on your face.

2858
03:25:51,150 --> 03:26:00,033
LAURA: You know what? We probably don't need the
three rooms. They offered us some over at The

2859
03:26:00,033 --> 03:26:02,474
Shade. It's fine.

2860
03:26:02,474 --> 03:26:06,290
MATT: "Certainly. Whatever your business may be.
Is that all you need?"

2861
03:26:06,290 --> 03:26:11,980
LAURA: Are you from Tal'Dorei?

2862
03:26:11,980 --> 03:26:14,438
MATT: "Me? No. Not originally."

2863
03:26:14,438 --> 03:26:15,924
LAURA: No.

2864
03:26:15,924 --> 03:26:18,690
MATT: "Why?"

2865
03:26:18,690 --> 03:26:27,819
LAURA: So you haven't heard of Draconia? Can I see
from here if he has a tail or not?

2866
03:26:27,819 --> 03:26:30,428
MATT: There is no tail behind him.

2867
03:26:30,428 --> 03:26:33,068
LAURA: Have you heard?

2868
03:26:33,068 --> 03:26:36,475
MATT: "Of Draconia? Unfortunately."

2869
03:26:36,475 --> 03:26:38,732
LAURA: Have you heard what happened?

2870
03:26:38,732 --> 03:26:41,669
MATT: "No."

2871
03:26:41,669 --> 03:26:47,370
LAURA: Draconia has fallen.

2872
03:26:47,370 --> 03:26:55,333
MATT: Grabs his drink that he's holding up, slams
it on the table. It spills over. "You fucking with me?"

2873
03:26:55,333 --> 03:26:58,501
LAURA: No.

2874
03:26:58,501 --> 03:27:02,723
MATT: "Well, there's a reason for
celebration." And just chugs the entire drink in

2875
03:27:02,723 --> 03:27:08,596
one go, you can see his dragonborn gullet just
accepting the entire drink in one gulp. (sighs)

2876
03:27:08,596 --> 03:27:17,658
LAURA: Well, I'd be happy to tell you more detail
for a reasonable price on the rooms.

2877
03:27:17,658 --> 03:27:36,105
MATT: (laughs) "Sit down. All of you. 15 gold for
the lot. All the meaty details. Sure."

2878
03:27:36,105 --> 03:27:38,437
LAURA: So we tell him.

2879
03:27:38,437 --> 03:27:48,511
MATT: You tell him about everything, and he
listens in. He starts enjoying it, and eventually

2880
03:27:48,511 --> 03:27:57,579
falls a bit, sinking in the stake of things, and
eventually that celebration falls to acceptance.

2881
03:27:57,579 --> 03:28:00,971
TALIESIN: Does anyone mind if I fill him in on the
future of Draconia?

2882
03:28:00,971 --> 03:28:03,702
SAM: If you do it in a slurry speech, sure.

2883
03:28:03,702 --> 03:28:11,869
TALIESIN: It's going to be slightly slurry, but at
this point at least I'm English again. We have the

2884
03:28:11,869 --> 03:28:19,072
next several weeks we were going to attempt to
free the populace from their new lord and master.

2885
03:28:19,072 --> 03:28:28,055
But in order to do that we are here on a mission.
We're searching for something. We're searching for

2886
03:28:28,055 --> 03:28:35,124
a one-eyed merchant warrior, and a cloak.

2887
03:28:35,124 --> 03:28:44,628
MATT: "Well look, if you're looking to hire,
you've got to explain the task then. We do have a

2888
03:28:44,628 --> 03:28:47,421
"code. Fuck what the rumors say."

2889
03:28:47,421 --> 03:28:53,396
TALIESIN: I've never found anyone who doesn't have
a code who lived very long to tell about it.

2890
03:28:53,396 --> 03:28:58,522
MATT: "Aye. Long enough. What's the point in
living without one? That's how you end up shivved

2891
03:28:58,522 --> 03:29:02,584
"in the stomach and left to bleed in the street.
What you looking to hire for?"

2892
03:29:02,584 --> 03:29:12,234
TALIESIN: We are looking for the one-eyed merchant
warrior who wears the coat of Cabal's Ruin.

2893
03:29:12,234 --> 03:29:15,105
MATT: "I know who you're seeking, aye. Mistress
Asharru."

2894
03:29:15,105 --> 03:29:16,774
TALIESIN: Mistress Asharru?

2895
03:29:16,774 --> 03:29:19,019
MARISHA: We have a name! Goddamn it.

2896
03:29:19,019 --> 03:29:27,252
MATT: "She's one of our finest, and expensive
because of it. But friend, she's been off for a

2897
03:29:27,252 --> 03:29:35,207
"week since her last job, so mayhaps her schedule
is open. Would have to inquire. Write me a summary

2898
03:29:35,207 --> 03:29:40,398
"of your job you have for her. I'll have it
delivered. Her answer may take a week or so."

2899
03:29:40,398 --> 03:29:46,523
TALIESIN: We do not have, sadly, a week or so. The
dragon falls in two weeks.

2900
03:29:46,523 --> 03:29:50,981
MATT: "Well, write her a letter, she'll receive
it, and she'll return to you when she sees it fit.

2901
03:29:50,981 --> 03:29:57,072
"Our business is our business. If you don't like
it, shove off, find someone else."

2902
03:29:57,072 --> 03:30:01,491
TALIESIN: Sadly no one else will do. Not that I
want to inquire of the sort of business she's in,

2903
03:30:01,491 --> 03:30:07,772
because that's inappropriate, but is she in the
town at least? If we were to write her, could we

2904
03:30:07,772 --> 03:30:09,601
get word to her quickly?

2905
03:30:09,601 --> 03:30:13,847
MATT: "Why, I can get word to her immediately, but
it's up to her when she wants to respond."

2906
03:30:13,847 --> 03:30:17,525
TALIESIN: Is there anything else you can tell me
about her?

2907
03:30:17,525 --> 03:30:22,489
MATT: He starts giving you a curious look and
goes, "You come in here asking to hire one of my

2908
03:30:22,489 --> 03:30:24,703
"finest and don't know what work she does?"

2909
03:30:24,703 --> 03:30:26,988
TALIESIN: I know what work she does.

2910
03:30:26,988 --> 03:30:29,684
MATT: "What work do you need her for?"

2911
03:30:29,684 --> 03:30:31,850
TALIESIN: We need to save the world.

2912
03:30:31,850 --> 03:30:34,409
MATT: "And you need her help to save the world."

2913
03:30:34,409 --> 03:30:38,102
TALIESIN: Sadly, but true. We at the very least
need her blessing.

2914
03:30:38,102 --> 03:30:42,389
LAURA: While he's talking, can I keep an eye on
the figure in the corner?

2915
03:30:42,389 --> 03:30:46,140
MATT: Yeah. Make a perception check.

2916
03:30:46,140 --> 03:30:54,772
TALIESIN: There are things that have been released
upon this earth that will burn everything. And

2917
03:30:54,772 --> 03:31:04,538
they will make their way here. Draconia is gone.
Tal'Dorei is gone. All swaths of civilization have

2918
03:31:04,538 --> 03:31:06,451
been wiped off the earth.

2919
03:31:06,451 --> 03:31:10,524
MATT: "We've weathered beasts. We've weathered
dragons here in Emon."

2920
03:31:10,524 --> 03:31:12,374
TALIESIN: Not like we've seen.

2921
03:31:12,374 --> 03:31:21,604
MATT: "So be it. But nevertheless, you want to
hire her, you've got to write her a proposal." And

2922
03:31:21,604 --> 03:31:27,444
he slides across a piece of parchment with a small
quill about it. "I'll deliver it, and she'll get

2923
03:31:27,444 --> 03:31:29,295
"back to you when she sees fit."

2924
03:31:29,295 --> 03:31:32,747
SAM: Does she have a normal price?

2925
03:31:32,747 --> 03:31:36,733
MATT: "Depends on the job you're asking. She'll
set her price."

2926
03:31:36,733 --> 03:31:38,378
SAM: Okay.

2927
03:31:38,378 --> 03:31:40,250
LAURA: 30 perception.

2928
03:31:40,250 --> 03:31:46,659
MATT: 30 perception? The figure is watching all of
you intensely but has not moved an inch. All

2929
03:31:46,659 --> 03:31:50,290
you've seen are the eyes move, but they've been
trained on your entire group since you arrived.

2930
03:31:50,290 --> 03:31:52,449
LIAM: I've been watching.

2931
03:31:52,449 --> 03:31:56,721
SAM: Okay.

2932
03:31:56,721 --> 03:32:08,366
TRAVIS: Could I ask, (coughs) other than gambling,
what sort of entertainment can you find in this city?

2933
03:32:08,366 --> 03:32:20,772
MATT: "All sorts of entertainment. There's various
singers, musicians, dancers, performers. If you're

2934
03:32:20,772 --> 03:32:24,010
"looking for company there's all sorts of
entertainment in that regard, of all the

2935
03:32:24,010 --> 03:32:32,873
"spectrums. If you're looking for games, probably a
few months out before we get to any sort of the

2936
03:32:32,873 --> 03:32:34,413
"gladiatorial events."

2937
03:32:34,413 --> 03:32:40,105
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, could you just, a bit more
on--

2938
03:32:40,105 --> 03:32:42,798
MATT: "That's months away."

2939
03:32:42,798 --> 03:32:46,465
LIAM: There's no place for our friend to get
into a scrap?

2940
03:32:46,465 --> 03:32:50,568
MATT: "Well, you could certainly find a scrap, but
none that are sanctioned by the Hand, and they'll

2941
03:32:50,568 --> 03:32:51,928
"put you away."

2942
03:32:51,928 --> 03:32:53,810
LIAM: Sorry, big man.

2943
03:32:53,810 --> 03:33:00,835
MATT: "Lest you have someone to duel you. That's a
whole different business."

2944
03:33:00,835 --> 03:33:02,104
TRAVIS: What? Duel?

2945
03:33:02,104 --> 03:33:03,665
MATT: "That's sanctioned by the law."

2946
03:33:03,665 --> 03:33:06,071
TRAVIS: A duel? A one-on-one duel?

2947
03:33:06,071 --> 03:33:09,162
MATT: "If you challenge one to a duel and they
accept, aye."

2948
03:33:09,162 --> 03:33:14,132
TRAVIS: In this city, it's legal? Anytime? High
noon, midnight, when?

2949
03:33:14,132 --> 03:33:19,018
MATT: "You just have to sanction it by the Hand.
You have to make sure that you both agree to fight

2950
03:33:19,018 --> 03:33:28,267
"to the death, and the fight has to happen in the
Bowl of Judgment."

2951
03:33:28,267 --> 03:33:30,621
TRAVIS and SAM: The Bowl of Judgment?

2952
03:33:30,621 --> 03:33:35,321
MATT: "Sits about the Sandherald district outside
of the Cerulean Palace."

2953
03:33:35,321 --> 03:33:39,700
TRAVIS: Wait, is that that super fucking tall thing
we saw?

2954
03:33:39,700 --> 03:33:42,588
MATT: "That's the Cerulean Palace. It's quite
close to it, aye."

2955
03:33:42,588 --> 03:33:47,196
LAURA: Are any items allowed in the bowl, or do
you have to go in bare-handed?

2956
03:33:47,196 --> 03:33:54,531
MATT: "It depends on the sanctions of the Ord and
the agreement you come to, but fisticuffs are

2957
03:33:54,531 --> 03:33:58,237
"great for the gladiatorial events, but if you're
fighting to the death, sometimes it's nice to

2958
03:33:58,237 --> 03:34:00,172
"bring a blade in."

2959
03:34:00,172 --> 03:34:04,123
MARISHA: So what type of people like to
participate in these duels?

2960
03:34:04,123 --> 03:34:09,369
MATT: "The kind that got nothing to lose. The kind
that got a point worth proving with their life.

2961
03:34:09,369 --> 03:34:15,162
"Those kind. Doesn't happen often. When it does
happen, it's a spectacle."

2962
03:34:15,162 --> 03:34:18,352
TALIESIN: Is there like a lighter fight that can
be found?

2963
03:34:18,352 --> 03:34:23,459
SAM: Arm wrestling match.

2964
03:34:23,459 --> 03:34:27,713
TALIESIN: Arm wrestling or-- I don't know, what
would be worse less than--

2965
03:34:27,713 --> 03:34:29,559
LAURA: UFC.

2966
03:34:29,559 --> 03:34:31,965
MARISHA: Less than a Bowl of Judgment?

2967
03:34:31,965 --> 03:34:34,893
SAM: Cup of Truth?

2968
03:34:34,893 --> 03:34:37,348
(laughter)

2969
03:34:37,348 --> 03:34:40,815
TALIESIN: A Wok of Truth, maybe.

2970
03:34:40,815 --> 03:34:42,451
MARISHA: Bowl of Wheaties.

2971
03:34:42,451 --> 03:34:44,004
LIAM: Tablespoon of Wrath.

2972
03:34:44,004 --> 03:34:46,165
(laughter)

2973
03:34:46,165 --> 03:34:49,199
TALIESIN: This is really uncomfortable.

2974
03:34:49,199 --> 03:34:52,342
MATT: "A few months until the games begin, but
until then, that's about the only way you'll find

2975
03:34:52,342 --> 03:34:55,253
"bloodshed here. At least that won't lend you up in
prison."

2976
03:34:55,253 --> 03:34:56,780
TRAVIS: All right.

2977
03:34:56,780 --> 03:34:58,525
SAM and LAURA: Good to know.

2978
03:34:58,525 --> 03:35:01,456
TALIESIN: I'm sitting and I'm starting to compose
a letter.

2979
03:35:01,456 --> 03:35:04,138
LAURA: How's his handwriting?

2980
03:35:04,138 --> 03:35:06,831
TALIESIN: Flouncy.

2981
03:35:06,831 --> 03:35:09,524
MATT: You're starting to gain it back. What do you
write?

2982
03:35:09,524 --> 03:35:17,248
TALIESIN: I'm going to show everybody before I
hand it in. I'm going to write the truth, top to

2983
03:35:17,248 --> 03:35:27,539
bottom, of the world is peril, we are facing a
battle, and she holds or knows of an item that

2984
03:35:27,539 --> 03:35:33,442
would turn the tide, and I wish to know its price
or know its rental.

2985
03:35:33,442 --> 03:35:35,441
MARISHA: Wow.

2986
03:35:35,441 --> 03:35:38,349
SAM: What are you asking her?

2987
03:35:38,349 --> 03:35:41,895
MARISHA: I feel like that's not going to work.

2988
03:35:41,895 --> 03:35:47,658
TALIESIN: I'm holding it. Before I hand it in I'm
going to show. I don't feel that there is any

2989
03:35:47,658 --> 03:35:56,217
deceit-- there is nothing I can think to say beyond
the truth. We are either dealing with honest

2990
03:35:56,217 --> 03:35:58,177
people, or we are not.

2991
03:35:58,177 --> 03:36:02,392
MARISHA: I have a feeling that... yeah.

2992
03:36:02,392 --> 03:36:04,295
LAURA: What if we just--

2993
03:36:04,295 --> 03:36:11,129
TALIESIN: I'm also putting my rank and title and
letting them know that I'm willing to--

2994
03:36:11,129 --> 03:36:17,319
SAM: Give away Vex's title?

2995
03:36:17,319 --> 03:36:21,733
TALIESIN: I'm willing to give away Vex. Vex is
entirely up for sale. No.

2996
03:36:21,733 --> 03:36:30,717
TRAVIS: You're planning to recruit this person?

2997
03:36:30,717 --> 03:36:35,027
TALIESIN: I'm not looking to recruit this person.
I'm looking to rent or buy an object that she

2998
03:36:35,027 --> 03:36:43,922
owns, or perhaps even trade, and we'll put 400
gold.

2999
03:36:43,922 --> 03:36:45,262
MARISHA: Just to meet with her?

3000
03:36:45,262 --> 03:36:46,769
LAURA: Just to meet with her.

3001
03:36:46,769 --> 03:36:48,138
TALIESIN: As an offer of a meeting.

3002
03:36:48,138 --> 03:36:49,652
LIAM and MARISHA: That's not bad.

3003
03:36:49,652 --> 03:36:53,094
MATT: He takes it. He packages in in a small
container, a leather container.

3004
03:36:53,094 --> 03:36:56,855
MARISHA: Did you put in there that it had to be
prompt? That it had to be prompt?

3005
03:36:56,855 --> 03:36:58,767
TALIESIN: And that time is of the essence.

3006
03:36:58,767 --> 03:37:03,669
MATT: "Oh, don't worry." (whistles) Whistles
through his fingers and the figure in the wall

3007
03:37:03,669 --> 03:37:11,111
that you'd been watching steps forward and slowly
walks towards the table. Holds up the scroll, and the

3008
03:37:11,111 --> 03:37:17,946
figure leans in. Covers his mouth and he whispers
into the ear of the figure. The figure takes the

3009
03:37:17,946 --> 03:37:23,852
scroll, gives a nod to all of you, and walks out
of the tavern. "He'll deliver that to her

3010
03:37:23,852 --> 03:37:30,500
"promptly, now be on your way. 15 gold."

3011
03:37:30,500 --> 03:37:34,816
LAURA: Oh yes, of course! Thank you for the rooms.

3012
03:37:34,816 --> 03:37:38,968
MATT: Takes a keyring out and starts fudging
through the keys, pulls a few off and tosses them

3013
03:37:38,968 --> 03:37:42,251
to you across the table. "All right, you've got it
for a night."

3014
03:37:42,251 --> 03:37:45,090
LIAM: I heard Grog. I'm going to follow out the
door, go stealth.

3015
03:37:45,090 --> 03:37:51,858
MATT: Okay. You vanish out the door. Make a
perception check.

3016
03:37:51,858 --> 03:37:57,045
LIAM: 22.

3017
03:37:57,045 --> 03:38:04,831
MATT: 22. Okay. As you glance out the door and
pull outside-- you're going stealth as well, you

3018
03:38:04,831 --> 03:38:06,501
said? Roll stealth.

3019
03:38:06,501 --> 03:38:10,344
LIAM: That is 25.

3020
03:38:10,344 --> 03:38:18,541
MATT: 25. Okay. You turn around the corner just as
you see a flash of dark cloth around the edge of

3021
03:38:18,541 --> 03:38:23,725
the Debt's Respite. You rush off to the edge and
look around the corner way and down the alley. You

3022
03:38:23,725 --> 03:38:29,998
can see the figure, full on, arms out to the side
rushed behind, going into a very fast run, down

3023
03:38:29,998 --> 03:38:31,998
the shaded hallway.

3024
03:38:31,998 --> 03:38:33,939
LIAM: Shaded hallway?

3025
03:38:33,939 --> 03:38:35,716
MATT: The alleyway.

3026
03:38:35,716 --> 03:38:37,262
LIAM: I'll follow.

3027
03:38:37,262 --> 03:38:39,650
MATT: Okay, so you continue to follow.

3028
03:38:39,650 --> 03:38:42,309
LIAM: At a distance.

3029
03:38:42,309 --> 03:38:50,706
MATT: All right. Following the masked figure, you
continue to give chance. It darts erratically,

3030
03:38:50,706 --> 03:38:55,437
zig-zagging between areas. You can see this is a
very trained pattern to lose anybody following

3031
03:38:55,437 --> 03:39:00,397
them, but you're also trained in following those
that wish not to be followed. Make another

3032
03:39:00,397 --> 03:39:03,990
perception check.

3033
03:39:03,990 --> 03:39:05,699
LIAM: 24.

3034
03:39:05,699 --> 03:39:13,100
MATT: You come around one corner, and you can see
there's a wall that ends there, and you see just a

3035
03:39:13,100 --> 03:39:18,633
little slip of material pass. And as you glance
over, you can see the figure has jumped down onto

3036
03:39:18,633 --> 03:39:25,641
a lower walkway onto what appears to be a recessed
sector of this part of Ank'Harel, and has already

3037
03:39:25,641 --> 03:39:30,317
darted beneath a nearby bridge and overpass that
walks across to another series of buildings. You

3038
03:39:30,317 --> 03:39:38,823
leap over, keeping in the shadow, and give chase
down that way. You turn around underneath the

3039
03:39:38,823 --> 03:39:42,444
bridge and you can see underneath the bridge,
there is an archway that leads into a dark path

3040
03:39:42,444 --> 03:39:46,398
down an actual hallway beneath the series of
buildings you just saw ahead of you. Make another

3041
03:39:46,398 --> 03:39:48,341
perception check.

3042
03:39:48,341 --> 03:39:50,907
LIAM: 22.

3043
03:39:50,907 --> 03:39:57,553
MATT: 22. You look down the hallway, and you see
the shadow of the figure framed against what looks

3044
03:39:57,553 --> 03:40:00,792
to be another opening on the opposite side but the
sunlight is coming through. You can just see the

3045
03:40:00,792 --> 03:40:07,076
dark outline as it darts forward and then leaps
off again, down the right past that exit. You

3046
03:40:07,076 --> 03:40:17,757
follow, and you look off the side just as you see
the figure slink behind one large crate next to a

3047
03:40:17,757 --> 03:40:25,422
storage section outside of a warehouse. It ducks
behind another one. Darts up to a building that

3048
03:40:25,422 --> 03:40:39,167
looks to be shuttered and closed. It looks like a
furniture store with a little sign at the top that

3049
03:40:39,167 --> 03:40:49,038
says, "A Kingly Home." It moves an empty rain
barrel to the side and slips the leather case

3050
03:40:49,038 --> 03:40:54,569
through a hole that was previously hidden by the
barrel, dropping it inside the building, slides

3051
03:40:54,569 --> 03:40:59,668
the barrel over it again. Looks back and forth.
Make another stealth check.

3052
03:40:59,668 --> 03:41:02,832
LIAM: 25.

3053
03:41:02,832 --> 03:41:09,732
MATT: 25. Doesn't seem to make notice, and then
darts off, leaping, leaping up onto a rooftop and

3054
03:41:09,732 --> 03:41:11,432
vanishing off.

3055
03:41:11,432 --> 03:41:12,790
LIAM: You said, "A Kingly Home"?

3056
03:41:12,790 --> 03:41:14,038
MATT: A Kingly Home.

3057
03:41:14,038 --> 03:41:17,684
LIAM: I'm going to stealth back to the Debt's
Respite.

3058
03:41:17,684 --> 03:41:22,629
MATT: Keeping a very close watch on the path you
took and marking it mentally back to the Debt's

3059
03:41:22,629 --> 03:41:28,640
Respite. It's probably a good mile off from where
you guys were, if not a little further. You guys

3060
03:41:28,640 --> 03:41:31,575
continue your conversation, go about your own
business. Eventually, Vax returns with the

3061
03:41:31,575 --> 03:41:34,371
information, the path of wherever this letter was
dropped off to.

3062
03:41:34,371 --> 03:41:38,935
TRAVIS: Just curious, have you ever had the
Sandkheg Hide?

3063
03:41:38,935 --> 03:41:44,446
MATT: "Are you serious?"

3064
03:41:44,446 --> 03:41:48,312
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'm just asking.

3065
03:41:48,312 --> 03:41:50,857
MATT: "No, I ain't drinking that bullshit."

3066
03:41:50,857 --> 03:41:51,741
TRAVIS: Really?

3067
03:41:51,741 --> 03:41:52,515
MATT: "Yeah."

3068
03:41:52,515 --> 03:41:53,840
TRAVIS: Too stiff for you?

3069
03:41:53,840 --> 03:41:59,486
MATT: "Too stiff for anyone! It's-- what?"

3070
03:41:59,486 --> 03:42:04,214
TRAVIS: I mean, I hear only real bosses can drink
that jazz.

3071
03:42:04,214 --> 03:42:09,597
MATT: "That's not a drink. That's probably
squeezed from the arsehole of some sort of beast

3072
03:42:09,597 --> 03:42:14,513
"out in the desert. I prefer my stuff taken from
berries and the sweet stuff."

3073
03:42:14,513 --> 03:42:20,583
TRAVIS: What do you mean, some beast? Who'd make a
drink out of some animal's whatever?

3074
03:42:20,583 --> 03:42:23,395
MATT: "Have you have some, have you tasted it?"

3075
03:42:23,395 --> 03:42:25,126
TRAVIS: Yeah!

3076
03:42:25,126 --> 03:42:29,308
MATT: "Then I guess you know what an animal's bum tastes
like, eh?"

3077
03:42:29,308 --> 03:42:35,496
TRAVIS: (sputters) Hold on. You mean they squeeze
the asshole of something out there?

3078
03:42:35,496 --> 03:42:36,775
MATT: "Oh, completely!"

3079
03:42:36,775 --> 03:42:37,753
TRAVIS: No!

3080
03:42:37,753 --> 03:42:42,827
MATT: "They hold it down and just squeeze its abdomen
and the whole sandkheg spews out into this little

3081
03:42:42,827 --> 03:42:46,131
"glass barrel and then you pay for it. Top
dollar."

3082
03:42:46,131 --> 03:42:49,276
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's 300 something gold!

3083
03:42:49,276 --> 03:42:51,092
MATT: "Oh, did you buy some?"

3084
03:42:51,092 --> 03:42:52,418
TRAVIS: No.

3085
03:42:52,418 --> 03:42:55,044
MATT: Make an insight check.

3086
03:42:55,044 --> 03:43:01,801
TRAVIS: Three.

3087
03:43:01,801 --> 03:43:05,853
MATT: You brain is filled with image of whatever
creature your imagination has come up with being

3088
03:43:05,853 --> 03:43:06,950
held down.

3089
03:43:06,950 --> 03:43:10,527
TRAVIS: It's a giant, hairy water yak.

3090
03:43:10,527 --> 03:43:17,220
MATT: And it is squeezing some sort of yellowish
liquid from its abdomen into a glass wine bottle,

3091
03:43:17,220 --> 03:43:22,241
and you're now looking over at Percy and Keyleth
who had just had sips of this earlier. It's not

3092
03:43:22,241 --> 03:43:24,140
sitting well with your stomach.

3093
03:43:24,140 --> 03:43:34,988
TRAVIS: We were gifted a bottle, and a couple of
my friends had partook.

3094
03:43:34,988 --> 03:43:39,413
MATT: (cackles)

3095
03:43:39,413 --> 03:43:43,671
TRAVIS: They say the stuff we had is A-plus.

3096
03:43:43,671 --> 03:43:45,188
TALIESIN: Yes.

3097
03:43:45,188 --> 03:43:47,351
MATT: Vax now appears at the edge of the table.

3098
03:43:47,351 --> 03:43:50,242
LAURA: Oh, hi!

3099
03:43:50,242 --> 03:43:52,170
LIAM: Hey. Took a little walk.

3100
03:43:52,170 --> 03:43:57,295
LAURA: Let's go to the rooms. Let's check it out.
How about that?

3101
03:43:57,295 --> 03:43:58,641
LIAM: Sure.

3102
03:43:58,641 --> 03:44:03,783
LAURA: Thank you for the rooms. Breakfast? Is
there breakfast here?

3103
03:44:03,783 --> 03:44:06,087
MATT: (scoffs) "No, you find your own food."

3104
03:44:06,087 --> 03:44:07,590
LAURA: Awesome.

3105
03:44:07,590 --> 03:44:11,826
MARISHA: Does he still have some drink in front of
him?

3106
03:44:11,826 --> 03:44:14,165
MATT: It hasn't been filled since, no.

3107
03:44:14,165 --> 03:44:15,458
MARISHA: Oh, never mind.

3108
03:44:15,458 --> 03:44:21,887
MATT: Do you guys head to your rooms? Okay. You
make your way up to the rooms. They're all clean,

3109
03:44:21,887 --> 03:44:25,936
serviceable, nothing too fancy, but functional
rooms. Each with two beds.

3110
03:44:25,936 --> 03:44:32,131
TALIESIN: I want to check for anything unusual, if
there's anything iffy about the rooms.

3111
03:44:32,131 --> 03:44:33,758
MATT: Investigation check.

3112
03:44:33,758 --> 03:44:36,465
LAURA: Oh, I would follow suit.

3113
03:44:36,465 --> 03:44:38,382
MATT: Investigation check.

3114
03:44:38,382 --> 03:44:40,146
TALIESIN: Oh, for the love of fucking--

3115
03:44:40,146 --> 03:44:41,651
MATT: Natural one?

3116
03:44:41,651 --> 03:44:43,814
TALIESIN: No. Nine.

3117
03:44:43,814 --> 03:44:46,706
MATT: Nine. Nothing seems to be out of place or
out of the ordinary.

3118
03:44:46,706 --> 03:44:48,324
TALIESIN: Obviously.

3119
03:44:48,324 --> 03:44:50,168
LAURA: 13.

3120
03:44:50,168 --> 03:44:52,937
MATT: 13? Seems to be a room.

3121
03:44:52,937 --> 03:44:55,622
SAM: I'm just going to check under the beds,
that's it.

3122
03:44:55,622 --> 03:44:57,351
MATT: Okay. Make an investigation check.

3123
03:44:57,351 --> 03:44:59,316
SAM: 29!

3124
03:44:59,316 --> 03:45:05,486
MATT: 29. You find dust, dead insects, a dried-out
rodent husk, and that's it.

3125
03:45:05,486 --> 03:45:07,747
LIAM: Grog, you want to bunk up?

3126
03:45:07,747 --> 03:45:11,631
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure. Are we going two to a room?

3127
03:45:11,631 --> 03:45:13,787
LIAM: Yeah, there's six of us.

3128
03:45:13,787 --> 03:45:15,527
MATT: It's also about 3:00 in the afternoon.

3129
03:45:15,527 --> 03:45:21,820
LIAM: I know that. I'm not going to go lie down on
the floor. I just thought I'd call dibs.

3130
03:45:21,820 --> 03:45:23,436
TRAVIS: Yeah. Cool.

3131
03:45:23,436 --> 03:45:26,667
LAURA: Scanlan, then. Me and you?

3132
03:45:26,667 --> 03:45:27,990
SAM: Sure!

3133
03:45:27,990 --> 03:45:32,214
LAURA: No. I'm kidding. I don't want
to be in the same room with you at all.

3134
03:45:32,214 --> 03:45:36,441
SAM: Oh, I need a bucket and a mop.

3135
03:45:36,441 --> 03:45:41,336
LAURA: No. You're with him.

3136
03:45:41,336 --> 03:45:43,997
MARISHA: I'm with Vex.

3137
03:45:43,997 --> 03:45:45,594
TALIESIN: Yes. What?

3138
03:45:45,594 --> 03:45:46,951
LAURA: Yes.

3139
03:45:46,951 --> 03:45:48,115
MARISHA: Have fun!

3140
03:45:48,115 --> 03:45:49,265
TALIESIN: With-- not-- no!

3141
03:45:49,265 --> 03:45:50,863
LIAM: That's later.

3142
03:45:50,863 --> 03:45:52,680
LAURA: What did you see?

3143
03:45:52,680 --> 03:45:58,251
LIAM: Yeah, so we've got a backup plan because I
followed whoever that person was back to where

3144
03:45:58,251 --> 03:46:06,827
they dropped off. We should probably honor the
offer first. If that goes sideways, then we have a

3145
03:46:06,827 --> 03:46:07,779
backup plan.

3146
03:46:07,779 --> 03:46:10,267
TALIESIN: It's so rare that we're actually given
an opportunity to be honest about everything. We

3147
03:46:10,267 --> 03:46:11,930
might as well try it once, see if we like it.

3148
03:46:11,930 --> 03:46:15,995
SAM: But do you know where this person receives
her messages?

3149
03:46:15,995 --> 03:46:16,951
LIAM: Absolutely.

3150
03:46:16,951 --> 03:46:18,107
TALIESIN: Good.

3151
03:46:18,107 --> 03:46:19,200
TRAVIS: Where is it?

3152
03:46:19,200 --> 03:46:25,778
LIAM: Well, I don't know the names of the streets.
I remember what it looked like. If you want to

3153
03:46:25,778 --> 03:46:30,364
follow me, it's about a mile off. It looked like a
furniture store. A Kingly Rest.

3154
03:46:30,364 --> 03:46:33,616
LAURA: And you didn't even have to say jenga!

3155
03:46:33,616 --> 03:46:35,419
LIAM: Wonders never cease.

3156
03:46:35,419 --> 03:46:37,930
TRAVIS: A Kingly Rest. All right.

3157
03:46:37,930 --> 03:46:39,650
MATT: What are you guys doing?

3158
03:46:39,650 --> 03:46:46,207
LIAM: Well, the casino's tonight. The deal's off.
We can't get Grog in a fight.

3159
03:46:46,207 --> 03:46:48,818
LAURA: Do you have a red shirt, Scanlan? Do we
need to get you one?

3160
03:46:48,818 --> 03:46:51,593
SAM: Do we own anything red? Grog?

3161
03:46:51,593 --> 03:46:53,012
TRAVIS: What?

3162
03:46:53,012 --> 03:46:55,018
SAM: Do we have anything red?

3163
03:46:55,018 --> 03:46:58,895
TRAVIS: We have three fancy robes left.

3164
03:46:58,895 --> 03:47:02,472
MATT: You do not own a red shirt, but you could
probably find one. Not too difficult.

3165
03:47:02,472 --> 03:47:05,467
SAM: All right. I'll find one. Take 20 minutes.

3166
03:47:05,467 --> 03:47:10,534
MATT: It doesn't take you too long. Costs you two
silver pieces. You find a nice red shirt,

3167
03:47:10,534 --> 03:47:12,978
billowing sleeves. It's totally up your alley.

3168
03:47:12,978 --> 03:47:14,253
SAM: Okay, great!

3169
03:47:14,253 --> 03:47:20,340
TRAVIS: Can we go back out to the bazaar? Are far from
there, or are we still close?

3170
03:47:20,340 --> 03:47:24,139
MATT: He's gone through the bazaar. You're not too
far from it. Maybe a ten-minute walk.

3171
03:47:24,139 --> 03:47:26,063
TRAVIS: They sell any weapons?

3172
03:47:26,063 --> 03:47:27,879
LAURA: And potions. We need potions.

3173
03:47:27,879 --> 03:47:29,906
TALIESIN: Trinkets.

3174
03:47:29,906 --> 03:47:33,032
TRAVIS: Can I look and see if people are selling
weapons?

3175
03:47:33,032 --> 03:47:36,121
MATT: You walk around. and there are weapons being
sold.

3176
03:47:36,121 --> 03:47:38,776
TRAVIS: Are there any exotic weapons?

3177
03:47:38,776 --> 03:47:43,137
MATT: No. Most weapons you find here are
ornamental; they're for decoration. They're for

3178
03:47:43,137 --> 03:47:51,278
putting above mantelpieces. There are various
blades that have bolting mechanisms in the back

3179
03:47:51,278 --> 03:47:55,734
where you can easily mount them to a wall. None of
them, that you can see, at least, that are open in

3180
03:47:55,734 --> 03:48:01,656
this bazaar for sale, are presented as an actual
item for warfare.

3181
03:48:01,656 --> 03:48:04,889
TRAVIS: Okay.

3182
03:48:04,889 --> 03:48:07,529
TALIESIN: Is there a magic shop?

3183
03:48:07,529 --> 03:48:09,735
MATT: Make an investigation check.

3184
03:48:09,735 --> 03:48:10,764
TALIESIN: Oh god.

3185
03:48:10,764 --> 03:48:15,404
MARISHA: Come on, Percy. Roll something good.
That's better!

3186
03:48:15,404 --> 03:48:17,057
TALIESIN: 19.

3187
03:48:17,057 --> 03:48:28,924
MATT: 19. Asking about, you do come to, within the
bazaar, a small wooden building that's like a hut,

3188
03:48:28,924 --> 03:48:36,104
but it's constructed of dark wood panels. It
resembles those strange marionette performance boxes.

3189
03:48:36,104 --> 03:48:38,273
TALIESIN: Punch and Judy box, yeah.

3190
03:48:38,273 --> 03:48:46,631
MATT: Except it just has this one frazzled-looking
young woman standing there with long strands of

3191
03:48:46,631 --> 03:48:54,029
curly dark brown hair. Red lips, dark eyeshadow.
She's eagerly looking out with a sign in the front

3192
03:48:54,029 --> 03:48:57,830
that reads, "Oddities and Eccentricities."

3193
03:48:57,830 --> 03:49:01,670
TALIESIN: Good day.

3194
03:49:01,670 --> 03:49:04,311
MARISHA: Be pleased.

3195
03:49:04,311 --> 03:49:05,530
MATT: "Good day."

3196
03:49:05,530 --> 03:49:06,557
TALIESIN: Be pleased.

3197
03:49:06,557 --> 03:49:08,575
MATT: "Be pleased to you as well."

3198
03:49:08,575 --> 03:49:13,622
TALIESIN: I'm stocked up on eccentricities, but if
you have any oddities for sale, I'd be very

3199
03:49:13,622 --> 03:49:15,261
interested.

3200
03:49:15,261 --> 03:49:17,896
MATT: "There are many oddities at my disposal. I'm
Nisaba."

3201
03:49:17,896 --> 03:49:19,890
TALIESIN: Percival. Hello.

3202
03:49:19,890 --> 03:49:22,990
MATT: "What kind of oddities are you looking
for?"

3203
03:49:22,990 --> 03:49:29,496
TALIESIN: Honestly, this is my first time in the
city, and I'm trying to get a sense of what's

3204
03:49:29,496 --> 03:49:36,047
available for sale and what sorts of things one
would find in the city, so really, I'm interested

3205
03:49:36,047 --> 03:49:39,619
in touring your stock, especially if you have
anything exotic.

3206
03:49:39,619 --> 03:49:47,959
MATT: "Well, let me show you." Over the next five
minutes, she brings out all sorts of strange

3207
03:49:47,959 --> 03:49:58,105
knickknacks. It's essentially a display from the
most awkward of vintage Salvation Armies you've

3208
03:49:58,105 --> 03:49:59,432
ever come across.

3209
03:49:59,432 --> 03:50:00,996
TALIESIN: God, we've found a hipster.

3210
03:50:00,996 --> 03:50:09,835
MATT: However, you do catch a quick flash of what
appears to be some small crystalline vials that

3211
03:50:09,835 --> 03:50:12,683
appear to be strapped to some sort of leather
bandolier.

3212
03:50:12,683 --> 03:50:16,103
TALIESIN: Well, that's interesting. What do you
call that?

3213
03:50:16,103 --> 03:50:23,162
MATT: "This is for, well, a gentleman who passed
through many years ago, who claimed to be a great

3214
03:50:23,162 --> 03:50:30,544
"alchemist, sold this off when he had come into a
lot of debt within the city, so I made a good

3215
03:50:30,544 --> 03:50:32,783
"price. No one has really showed much interest in
it."

3216
03:50:32,783 --> 03:50:35,696
TALIESIN: Interesting. May I? May I take a look at
it?

3217
03:50:35,696 --> 03:50:36,842
MATT: "You may."

3218
03:50:36,842 --> 03:50:38,308
TALIESIN: Thank you.

3219
03:50:38,308 --> 03:50:44,251
MATT: The leather's finely made, if a little worn.
The chemicals inside-- one of them does have a

3220
03:50:44,251 --> 03:50:51,098
familiar color, a deep herbal red. This looks to
be some sort of a low to medium level healing

3221
03:50:51,098 --> 03:51:02,464
potion, most likely, from your experience in the
use of that. The two others are grayish and murky

3222
03:51:02,464 --> 03:51:04,968
and don't really draw your attention or anything
you're familiar with.

3223
03:51:04,968 --> 03:51:06,875
TALIESIN: Interesting.

3224
03:51:06,875 --> 03:51:08,911
MARISHA: Percy, what's that?

3225
03:51:08,911 --> 03:51:11,498
TALIESIN: I don't know. It's quite nice, though,
isn't it?

3226
03:51:11,498 --> 03:51:18,763
MARISHA: Well. Can I do a check on the other two
potions to see with my potion knowledge? My potion sense?

3227
03:51:18,763 --> 03:51:20,529
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

3228
03:51:20,529 --> 03:51:29,823
MARISHA: Not bad. Just straight intelligence? 15.

3229
03:51:29,823 --> 03:51:35,568
MATT: 15. They do appear to have been prepared in
the way that you prepare magically enchanted vials

3230
03:51:35,568 --> 03:51:42,239
for potions themselves, but you're not really able
to make out just at a glance. You'd have to spend

3231
03:51:42,239 --> 03:51:47,251
quite a time to make out what their nature is.

3232
03:51:47,251 --> 03:51:52,438
MARISHA: I'd have to look at it. Not familiar,
sorry. That looks like a health potion, though.

3233
03:51:52,438 --> 03:51:54,572
TALIESIN: Yeah. It does look a bit--

3234
03:51:54,572 --> 03:51:55,813
MARISHA: Healthy.

3235
03:51:55,813 --> 03:51:57,914
SAM: It's like Storage Wars. Just buy it. Who
knows what's in there?

3236
03:51:57,914 --> 03:52:03,082
TALIESIN: What were you hoping to unload for it?

3237
03:52:03,082 --> 03:52:08,429
MATT: "Well, knowing that is now a magic potion of
healing and two other magical potions, that is a

3238
03:52:08,429 --> 03:52:16,405
"very valuable belt with its contents. I would sell
you just the belt for five silver pieces. To

3239
03:52:16,405 --> 03:52:23,247
"include the vials, and they do come as a set,
unfortunately, that would run you 275 gold pieces."

3240
03:52:23,247 --> 03:52:27,096
TALIESIN: Now, see, we don't know what kind of
healing potion that is, and those other two vials

3241
03:52:27,096 --> 03:52:30,602
could have-- there is an expiration date on those
things. And how long have you had it?

3242
03:52:30,602 --> 03:52:34,075
MATT: "We've had it for a number of years."

3243
03:52:34,075 --> 03:52:37,772
TALIESIN: A number of years? Well, in that case,
they've probably gone stale by now. I would say 75

3244
03:52:37,772 --> 03:52:40,379
gold at the very best.

3245
03:52:40,379 --> 03:52:43,868
MATT: (chuckles) "That is not going to work." She
reaches out and takes the belt away from you and

3246
03:52:43,868 --> 03:52:45,375
sets it back down on the inside.

3247
03:52:45,375 --> 03:52:49,213
TALIESIN: 75 gold will not do you for that, then?

3248
03:52:49,213 --> 03:52:50,411
MATT: "For the belt, maybe."

3249
03:52:50,411 --> 03:52:55,042
TALIESIN: For the belt, obviously. We've already
established that that's in the silver range and

3250
03:52:55,042 --> 03:52:56,501
certainly not touching the gold.

3251
03:52:56,501 --> 03:52:59,585
MATT: "Right, but you're willing to have and to
offer that 75 gold for it, please."

3252
03:52:59,585 --> 03:53:01,451
TALIESIN: 75 gold for the entire set.

3253
03:53:01,451 --> 03:53:03,401
MATT: "No, it's not going to work. I'm sorry."

3254
03:53:03,401 --> 03:53:08,988
TALIESIN: No, and of course that makes sense that
a hundred gold for that entire set would be very fair.

3255
03:53:08,988 --> 03:53:11,290
LIAM: I'm starting to take a nap against a column
standing up.

3256
03:53:11,290 --> 03:53:13,049
SAM: Just buy it.

3257
03:53:13,049 --> 03:53:18,465
TALIESIN: 100 gold. You've had it for so long.

3258
03:53:18,465 --> 03:53:19,899
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

3259
03:53:19,899 --> 03:53:30,836
TALIESIN: This is going to go terribly. Where's my
persuasion? Ooh, that's almost a number. Oh, good. 16?

3260
03:53:30,836 --> 03:53:37,786
MATT: She goes, "225 gold for the set."

3261
03:53:37,786 --> 03:53:54,968
TALIESIN: 200. And an acknowledgement and
compliment to your stunning hair. I'm attempting

3262
03:53:54,968 --> 03:53:56,704
to flirt very poorly.

3263
03:53:56,704 --> 03:53:58,918
TRAVIS: (laughing) That eyebrow.

3264
03:53:58,918 --> 03:54:00,545
MATT: Make a charisma check.

3265
03:54:00,545 --> 03:54:01,734
TALIESIN: Yes!

3266
03:54:01,734 --> 03:54:04,171
MATT: Just a straight charisma modifier to your
roll.

3267
03:54:04,171 --> 03:54:05,879
LIAM: Come on, snitch.

3268
03:54:05,879 --> 03:54:08,539
TALIESIN: Come on. 12.

3269
03:54:08,539 --> 03:54:11,464
LAURA: You flirted with grass better!

3270
03:54:11,464 --> 03:54:16,525
MATT: She goes, "I appreciate your patronage, but
I am a patient woman, and that is how I hold

3271
03:54:16,525 --> 03:54:17,628
"business."

3272
03:54:17,628 --> 03:54:20,477
(laughter)

3273
03:54:20,477 --> 03:54:24,267
TRAVIS: Stonewalled!

3274
03:54:24,267 --> 03:54:25,927
TALIESIN: Keyleth?

3275
03:54:25,927 --> 03:54:27,024
MARISHA: Yes?

3276
03:54:27,024 --> 03:54:30,112
TALIESIN: I feel like I should have learned some
sort of lesson here. I'm just not entirely sure

3277
03:54:30,112 --> 03:54:31,134
what it was.

3278
03:54:31,134 --> 03:54:32,457
MARISHA: Oh, you know--

3279
03:54:32,457 --> 03:54:34,362
TALIESIN: Hardly matters, I suppose.

3280
03:54:34,362 --> 03:54:38,793
MARISHA: Maybe you'll come to it at the end of
being in Ank'Harel.

3281
03:54:38,793 --> 03:54:43,459
TRAVIS: Hey, guys. I had a thought. You know we
were all supposed to have a meeting with the king?

3282
03:54:43,459 --> 03:54:48,797
And I haven't been paying attention if anyone's
watching, and we got time to kill. Should we go

3283
03:54:48,797 --> 03:54:50,824
have a talk with the big man?

3284
03:54:50,824 --> 03:54:52,801
LAURA: Or at least put in for an audience.

3285
03:54:52,801 --> 03:54:55,357
TRAVIS: Yeah. Who knows if they'll even get to us
today?

3286
03:54:55,357 --> 03:54:58,412
TALIESIN: I'm sobering up a bit. Which we should
probably do that.

3287
03:54:58,412 --> 03:55:02,674
LAURA: Does it seem like a long walk towards the
Cerulean Palace?

3288
03:55:02,674 --> 03:55:07,302
MATT: Maybe a 45-minute to an hour walk.

3289
03:55:07,302 --> 03:55:10,199
LIAM: We've got hours and hours before we have to
do anything.

3290
03:55:10,199 --> 03:55:11,961
TALIESIN: We do. It's 4:00 in the afternoon.

3291
03:55:11,961 --> 03:55:15,879
LAURA: What time's the sun set here? Can I ask
somebody?

3292
03:55:15,879 --> 03:55:21,164
MATT: You ask around. It looks to probably be
about four hours from sunset.

3293
03:55:21,164 --> 03:55:22,476
TALIESIN: Perfect.

3294
03:55:22,476 --> 03:55:25,931
SAM: All right. Fine. Let's go.

3295
03:55:25,931 --> 03:55:29,083
MARISHA: Plus, the best way to see a new city is
to walk, you guys!

3296
03:55:29,083 --> 03:55:31,659
TALIESIN: Wait, hold on. I have to open my
Pokémon.

3297
03:55:31,659 --> 03:55:43,432
MATT: So you guys are making your way towards the
Cerulean Palace. As you approach the large,

3298
03:55:43,432 --> 03:55:54,078
extremely imposing palace, you come upon what
looks to be an endless series of stairs that

3299
03:55:54,078 --> 03:55:58,066
brings you to the upper platform that is the
central portion of the city where the palace seems

3300
03:55:58,066 --> 03:56:03,733
to reside, eventually peaking in the Sandherald
district that you were referred to earlier as the

3301
03:56:03,733 --> 03:56:13,229
location of the palace and where the Bowl of
Judgment exists. You step up to the very top of

3302
03:56:13,229 --> 03:56:18,378
the stairs to find yourself already breathless at
the sight of the immense purple-blue-colored

3303
03:56:18,378 --> 03:56:25,673
palace. A dozen towers reach for the clouds, the
daylight peeking through their slightly

3304
03:56:25,673 --> 03:56:32,723
translucent material, like glassy waters
ever-frozen in a fall. The central tower, the one

3305
03:56:32,723 --> 03:56:37,879
that caught your eye, that ends in a large
cup-like position, rises above all of them with a

3306
03:56:37,879 --> 03:56:45,414
slight spiral-type texture to the outside of the
palace that is incredibly tall amongst the rest of

3307
03:56:45,414 --> 03:56:46,779
the cityscape.

3308
03:56:46,779 --> 03:56:54,136
As you get closer, you can see the main palace
structure presents hundreds of arches pointed at

3309
03:56:54,136 --> 03:56:58,878
their apex in its structure, smaller and smaller
as it recesses further into the palace. Its very

3310
03:56:58,878 --> 03:57:08,689
architectural build is a marvel, and seems to both
have consistency and a chaotic feel to the

3311
03:57:08,689 --> 03:57:14,127
placement of some of these arches too, in size.
It's a very strange but fascinating structure.

3312
03:57:14,127 --> 03:57:22,577
You can also see turquoise detailing and trim
against many of the pillars and carvings and

3313
03:57:22,577 --> 03:57:28,486
statues that adorn the exterior of the grounds of
this palace. As you approach what appear to be the

3314
03:57:28,486 --> 03:57:35,939
front gates that ascend, with a very bright blue
turquoise exterior, close to 50 Hands of Ord

3315
03:57:35,939 --> 03:57:43,303
patrol various elements of the grounds around it.
It looks like there are actual pockets of grass

3316
03:57:43,303 --> 03:57:50,358
and gardens that exist around the Cerulean Palace
in here. The topography changes almost to feel

3317
03:57:50,358 --> 03:57:57,382
like it belongs entirely anywhere but the middle
of the desert. The guards do eye you suspiciously

3318
03:57:57,382 --> 03:58:02,886
as you approach, and you watch as one armored
woman, her dark hair hidden mostly beneath an

3319
03:58:02,886 --> 03:58:11,429
ornate helmet of brass and blue, approaches you
guys. "Welcome to the Cerulean Palace. I must ask

3320
03:58:11,429 --> 03:58:13,171
"your business here."

3321
03:58:13,171 --> 03:58:22,697
LAURA: Forgive us for our intrusion. We come
seeking an audience of J'mon Sa Ord.

3322
03:58:22,697 --> 03:58:28,854
MATT: "Our emperor does not take meetings. My
apologies, but I must ask you to leave."

3323
03:58:28,854 --> 03:58:37,574
TALIESIN: We are, in fact, a group of ambassadors
from the continent of Emon, from the cities of--

3324
03:58:37,574 --> 03:58:46,407
MARISHA: Continent of Tal'Dorei, city of Emon. It
concerns the fate of the world.

3325
03:58:46,407 --> 03:58:52,494
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

3326
03:58:52,494 --> 03:58:54,451
MARISHA: Which one?

3327
03:58:54,451 --> 03:59:01,599
TALIESIN: Not that one. That one. See? Listen to
me. I'm not taking credit for that.

3328
03:59:01,599 --> 03:59:03,569
MARISHA: 23. No, 24.

3329
03:59:03,569 --> 03:59:15,070
MATT: 24. "Let me inquire with the Grand Maven."
She turns around, her armor clinking, and walks

3330
03:59:15,070 --> 03:59:21,113
back to the palace, leaving you guys there amongst
these courtyard grounds. A few moments pass before

3331
03:59:21,113 --> 03:59:27,644
she returns, the doors opening. As she descends,
next to her you see an older woman with these

3332
03:59:27,644 --> 03:59:32,447
long, ceremonial robes that drag behind her,
spilling across the stairs as she descends,

3333
03:59:32,447 --> 03:59:38,912
seemingly dozens of gemmed bracelets that jingle
as she walks with each step. She wears a tall

3334
03:59:38,912 --> 03:59:45,158
headdress with what looks like brass quills that press
behind her head and down her back. As she

3335
03:59:45,158 --> 03:59:50,934
approaches you all, the woman earlier that you
spoke to, the Hand that approached you, stays

3336
03:59:50,934 --> 03:59:56,886
behind quietly and watches, weapon at the ready.
The woman steps forward with a smile, and unlike

3337
03:59:56,886 --> 04:00:02,910
the abrasive appearance that most of the Hand have
given, she seems to be more welcoming, and gives, for the

3338
04:00:02,910 --> 04:00:06,458
first time since you've been here, a very formal
welcoming bow with her hand before her, the other

3339
04:00:06,458 --> 04:00:14,076
hand out. Says, "Be pleased, everyone."

3340
04:00:14,076 --> 04:00:15,999
ALL: Be pleased.

3341
04:00:15,999 --> 04:00:24,868
MATT: "I must apologize. We were not aware of your
arrival here. I am the Grand Maven Gameshega.

3342
04:00:24,868 --> 04:00:28,489
"Please, enter and follow me."

3343
04:00:28,489 --> 04:00:32,140
TRAVIS: She's the what?

3344
04:00:32,140 --> 04:00:33,820
MARISHA: Gameshega?

3345
04:00:33,820 --> 04:00:35,385
MATT, LAURA, and LIAM: Gameshega.

3346
04:00:35,385 --> 04:00:36,537
MARISHA: Gameshega?

3347
04:00:36,537 --> 04:00:37,887
MATT and LIAM: Gameshega.

3348
04:00:37,887 --> 04:00:40,956
TALIESIN: This is good. This is very good.

3349
04:00:40,956 --> 04:00:49,529
MATT: As she walks past you and the female Hand
that saw you earlier steps aside and watches you

3350
04:00:49,529 --> 04:00:54,933
as you pass, then ends up stepping behind you and
flanking, keeping a watch from the back as you

3351
04:00:54,933 --> 04:01:01,510
guys are led up the final staircase, through the
front turquoise gates of the Cerulean Palace, and

3352
04:01:01,510 --> 04:01:07,694
they close behind you with a resounding (impact),
the impact echoing through these long halls. From

3353
04:01:07,694 --> 04:01:18,380
the interior, massive pointed archways that lead
down ornately decorated halls that echo with each

3354
04:01:18,380 --> 04:01:23,082
footfall that hits across what looks like endless
white and black bespeckled marble.

3355
04:01:23,082 --> 04:01:28,675
She leads you through a series of hallways, more
Hands walking past, as well as a number of other

3356
04:01:28,675 --> 04:01:33,696
robed individuals. What appears to be a central
chamber that has a number of steps and seats,

3357
04:01:33,696 --> 04:01:38,301
where it looks like various philosophers are in
mid-heated discussion in once again, this same

3358
04:01:38,301 --> 04:01:40,562
language that you have not heard on your ears
before.

3359
04:01:40,562 --> 04:01:48,958
You are eventually brought to a very intricate and
decorated waiting room, with some finely

3360
04:01:48,958 --> 04:01:58,402
upholstered silk chairs, couches. The Grand Maven
stops. "If you would not mind, please have a seat."

3361
04:01:58,402 --> 04:02:02,417
TALIESIN: Of course.

3362
04:02:02,417 --> 04:02:03,884
SAM: Sure, yeah.

3363
04:02:03,884 --> 04:02:11,477
MATT: She walks into a nearby doorway. It looks
like a single door that leads into a small-looking room,

3364
04:02:11,477 --> 04:02:21,138
from the brief moment you have to see it. The door
closes and you hear a (magic sound). Two minutes

3365
04:02:21,138 --> 04:02:28,409
pass. Five minutes pass. Ten eerie, quiet minutes
pass.

3366
04:02:28,409 --> 04:02:30,272
TRAVIS: Windows in this room?

3367
04:02:30,272 --> 04:02:38,664
MATT: No windows in this particular room, but you
notice as you take a close look, the roofs, while

3368
04:02:38,664 --> 04:02:44,907
they are built of this deep blue, almost
glass-like thick crystal, they're ever so slightly

3369
04:02:44,907 --> 04:02:49,669
translucent, and it gives this general blue glow
about the entire room. You can't make out any

3370
04:02:49,669 --> 04:02:53,805
details from the outside, but there is this
strange translucence to the entire structure.

3371
04:02:53,805 --> 04:02:55,773
TRAVIS: Was that the only door to the room?

3372
04:02:55,773 --> 04:03:00,373
MATT: There is the hallway that you left behind,
but there standing in the doorway is the same Hand

3373
04:03:00,373 --> 04:03:04,367
that approached you guys and has been keeping an
eye the entire time.

3374
04:03:04,367 --> 04:03:06,131
LAURA: He's in the room with us?

3375
04:03:06,131 --> 04:03:10,349
MATT: Is away from you, standing in the large
archway hall that led you into this waiting room.

3376
04:03:10,349 --> 04:03:17,304
LAURA: I'm up and pacing the room, trying to pace
near the door that she went through so I can keep

3377
04:03:17,304 --> 04:03:20,078
an ear on the door.

3378
04:03:20,078 --> 04:03:26,038
TRAVIS: I walk up to the guard, and I say, sorry.
I really should have peed before I came in. Is

3379
04:03:26,038 --> 04:03:28,358
there a privy I could use?

3380
04:03:28,358 --> 04:03:38,304
MATT: She glances at you. "You look like a
strapping young man. Perhaps you can hold onto

3381
04:03:38,304 --> 04:03:39,859
"that for a time."

3382
04:03:39,859 --> 04:03:43,720
TRAVIS: It looks that way, but I also have a
strapping-sized bladder, and I've been known to

3383
04:03:43,720 --> 04:03:49,731
leave strapping-sized messes in corners. You see,
I don't really come from all this finery, so the

3384
04:03:49,731 --> 04:03:53,806
side of the wall is just as good with me. It's
just I'm trying to be polite.

3385
04:03:53,806 --> 04:04:08,597
MATT: She leans behind the hallway. (foreign
language) "Just a moment." Another guard walks up

3386
04:04:08,597 --> 04:04:11,205
behind and kicks a bucket into the room.

3387
04:04:11,205 --> 04:04:14,840
TRAVIS: That'll do.

3388
04:04:14,840 --> 04:04:18,886
LIAM: Put up or shut up.

3389
04:04:18,886 --> 04:04:21,198
LAURA: Can I hear anything from the other side of
the door?

3390
04:04:21,198 --> 04:04:23,756
MATT: Make a perception check.

3391
04:04:23,756 --> 04:04:29,272
TALIESIN: I'm laughing out loud.

3392
04:04:29,272 --> 04:04:35,538
SAM: One?

3393
04:04:35,538 --> 04:04:39,006
MATT: You have your ear up against the wall.

3394
04:04:39,006 --> 04:04:43,536
LAURA: I didn't want to have my ear against the
wall. I wanted to be subtly doing it.

3395
04:04:43,536 --> 04:04:46,571
MATT: Well, you're subtly doing it, and there's
nothing. You get closer and closer, and there's

3396
04:04:46,571 --> 04:04:55,223
nothing. The rest of you hear (magic sounds), but
you're still-- Eventually, the door opens again,

3397
04:04:55,223 --> 04:05:04,787
and there the Grand Maven stands again. She looks
up to the rest of you. "Come with me. You have

3398
04:05:04,787 --> 04:05:09,019
"been granted an audience." She steps back into the
chamber.

3399
04:05:09,019 --> 04:05:12,207
LAURA: That happened much easier than I expected.

3400
04:05:12,207 --> 04:05:15,301
TRAVIS: Thank you for the bucket. I'll hold it.

3401
04:05:15,301 --> 04:05:17,742
LAURA: Are you sure, Grog?

3402
04:05:17,742 --> 04:05:21,359
LIAM: We were convincing.

3403
04:05:21,359 --> 04:05:23,510
SAM: They must know who we are.

3404
04:05:23,510 --> 04:05:28,710
TALIESIN: Trust our luck. Our luck is going. I'm
walking into this.

3405
04:05:28,710 --> 04:05:31,203
SAM: Anyone says jenga, kill everyone we meet.

3406
04:05:31,203 --> 04:05:34,105
LIAM: It's the only plan we have.

3407
04:05:34,105 --> 04:05:35,913
TALIESIN: I'm walking into it.

3408
04:05:35,913 --> 04:05:37,261
MARISHA: Yeah.

3409
04:05:37,261 --> 04:05:43,712
MATT: You walk into what is a cylindrical chamber
of smooth blue-purple quartz-like material with

3410
04:05:43,712 --> 04:05:49,917
four strands of heavy chains taut between the
ceiling and floor, about 15 feet above you. No

3411
04:05:49,917 --> 04:05:56,490
other exit. You all enter and the door closes
behind you, the Maven still relaxing, her arms to

3412
04:05:56,490 --> 04:06:04,458
her side, her headdress still giving her this
ominous presence. Looks up, and there's a (impact)

3413
04:06:04,458 --> 04:06:11,411
shuddering sound. Suddenly, the bland,
uncharacteristic walls, compared to the rest of

3414
04:06:11,411 --> 04:06:17,688
the palace, begin to slide past the chains, now
making this rattling sound as the floor itself

3415
04:06:17,688 --> 04:06:23,734
seems to be lurching. You feel a bit of pressure
in the room that wasn't there before. You're all

3416
04:06:23,734 --> 04:06:32,084
being lifted, and the walls, now no longer walled
in by the rest of the palace, you can now see this

3417
04:06:32,084 --> 04:06:38,513
occasional traveling-down line as the spiral on
the outside of the tower you once saw now

3418
04:06:38,513 --> 04:06:43,349
surrounds you. The walls are much thinner than the
rest of the palace, as you can see through this

3419
04:06:43,349 --> 04:06:49,890
somewhat-translucent glass exterior the entirety
of Emon surrounding you from upon high as it goes

3420
04:06:49,890 --> 04:06:55,086
lower and lower as you're lifted higher and higher
into this tower.

3421
04:06:55,086 --> 04:06:57,539
LAURA: This is miraculous!

3422
04:06:57,539 --> 04:07:02,692
MATT: It's very off-putting, but beautiful at the
same time. Everything's seen through this

3423
04:07:02,692 --> 04:07:12,877
shimmering, somewhat-refracted blue passage. As
you go higher and higher, you can see the

3424
04:07:12,877 --> 04:07:17,956
countless homes, walls, and towers getting smaller
and smaller, other towers eventually ending as you

3425
04:07:17,956 --> 04:07:24,634
go higher in the tower. The Maven says, "I request
you do not touch the walls, please."

3426
04:07:24,634 --> 04:07:26,650
SAM: Okay.

3427
04:07:26,650 --> 04:07:28,821
TRAVIS: I really want to touch the walls.

3428
04:07:28,821 --> 04:07:35,468
MATT: The view reveals the entirety of the city
around you, and beyond that, the distant dunes and

3429
04:07:35,468 --> 04:07:43,099
the desert that seems to have no end. You view a
far-off mountainscape a little bit in the northern

3430
04:07:43,099 --> 04:07:48,472
direction that just begins to peek past your
view, then (boom) the floor ceases again. You all

3431
04:07:48,472 --> 04:07:53,629
seem to lurch for a moment, yourself, an inch
before you catch yourself on your feet. The Maven

3432
04:07:53,629 --> 04:07:56,237
catches herself, very used to this transition.

3433
04:07:56,237 --> 04:08:02,419
You now see behind her, where it has stopped,
there is another set of doors, similar to the ones

3434
04:08:02,419 --> 04:08:08,319
you entered from in the bottom portion of this
tower. The door opens, (creak) and you can see the

3435
04:08:08,319 --> 04:08:15,665
next room is a set of staircases of the same color
that slowly curl off and disappear upward above you.

3436
04:08:15,665 --> 04:08:23,402
"Please, follow me." She walks in, her robe
dragging behind her. You guys give enough berth

3437
04:08:23,402 --> 04:08:28,840
for it to follow. As you're led up the stairway,
choosing right or left, they both lead to the

3438
04:08:28,840 --> 04:08:34,179
upper platform in what is the top of the central
tower of the Cerulean Palace.

3439
04:08:34,179 --> 04:08:43,586
As you enter this room, you see close to a hundred
dangling silk tapestries from 50 or 60 feet up of

3440
04:08:43,586 --> 04:08:49,629
multitudes of different colors; rainbowscapes of
beautiful translucent cloths and silks, gently

3441
04:08:49,629 --> 04:08:57,241
flowing with breezes and mingling and mixing into
each other around the outside of the wall. High

3442
04:08:57,241 --> 04:09:04,453
arched windows on each side, and behind, what
looks to be a large opening reveals passing clouds

3443
04:09:04,453 --> 04:09:10,204
surrounding this height and obfuscating certain
portions as they meet with the height of this

3444
04:09:10,204 --> 04:09:11,611
tower's apex.

3445
04:09:11,611 --> 04:09:17,641
You see a large balcony from the opposite side of
the room that is opened from its own similar-sized

3446
04:09:17,641 --> 04:09:22,618
arch that extends outward. It has a railing
about four feet up that is an opening that

3447
04:09:22,618 --> 04:09:27,707
overlooks in open air all above the city to see.

3448
04:09:27,707 --> 04:09:37,241
In the center of the chamber, you see a series of
step-like platforms, circular, that rise up upon

3449
04:09:37,241 --> 04:09:44,475
each other, and in the center, you see what seems
to be a tall throne of bronze and sapphire that

3450
04:09:44,475 --> 04:09:51,586
probably sits ten feet up from the base. Thin, but
extremely long and widens towards the top. You can

3451
04:09:51,586 --> 04:10:01,875
see hundreds of sapphires put into and set into
this shiny, ruddy metallic material that frames

3452
04:10:01,875 --> 04:10:03,950
the entirety of the throne.

3453
04:10:03,950 --> 04:10:13,867
And there sitting atop this throne, you see a
slender, human-like entity wearing no jewelry, no

3454
04:10:13,867 --> 04:10:19,489
ceremonial adornments, no crown, just a simple
brown cotton shirt over simple, elegant pants.

3455
04:10:19,489 --> 04:10:27,501
Bare feet, no shoes. Androgynous and beautiful;
you're unable to make out the sex of this

3456
04:10:27,501 --> 04:10:35,677
creature. It's not a man, nor elf. Not fey, but
something somewhat alien, almost. The skin a

3457
04:10:35,677 --> 04:10:46,182
deep-set reddish brown, smooth and impeccable. The
features are extremely fine and delicate. The eyes

3458
04:10:46,182 --> 04:10:56,086
are what catch you: black like night, but the
pupils, burning points of molten metal. The entity

3459
04:10:56,086 --> 04:11:04,357
smiles and stands off the throne. Now, at this
height, seeing it standing almost as tall as Grog,

3460
04:11:04,357 --> 04:11:13,388
by comparison. The limbs are elongated. Extends a
hand towards you as you step into the chamber.

3461
04:11:13,388 --> 04:11:29,137
"Welcome to Ank'Harel, heroes of Tal'Dorei. I am
J'mon Sa Ord, and it is my pleasure to greet you."

3462
04:11:29,137 --> 04:11:35,006
And that is where we'll pick up our session in two
weeks.
