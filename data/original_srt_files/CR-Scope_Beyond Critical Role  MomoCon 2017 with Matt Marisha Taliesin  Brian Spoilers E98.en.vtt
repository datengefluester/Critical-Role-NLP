NOTE Paragraph

00:00:17.526 --> 00:00:20.214
TALIESIN: No one tweet at Brian. He'll never
know.

00:00:20.214 --> 00:00:23.327
MARISHA: Don't tell him he's supposed to be here!

00:00:24.753 --> 00:00:26.953
TALIESIN: (whispering) It'll be our secret.

00:00:26.953 --> 00:00:29.478
MARISHA: Him breaking contract will be funny.

00:00:29.478 --> 00:00:33.533
MATT: I was told that we are supposed to eat the
mic for the purposes of this.

00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:38.373
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I love you, Matt.

00:00:38.373 --> 00:00:40.487
MATT: I love you too!

00:00:42.905 --> 00:00:46.555
MARISHA: I love that this has the name of our
panel on it for us as a reminder.

00:00:46.555 --> 00:00:48.978
TALIESIN: Of course you're glowing.

00:00:48.978 --> 00:00:50.550
HANNAH: Remember where you are.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.736
MATT: It's important.

00:00:51.736 --> 00:00:53.960
TALIESIN: That's amazing.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.675
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I love you, Papa Mercer!

00:01:01.018 --> 00:01:02.979
MARISHA: Are you Papa Mercer? Is that a thing?

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:04.627
MATT: We should have a talk.

00:01:04.627 --> 00:01:06.032
TALIESIN: It is now!

00:01:06.032 --> 00:01:07.055
MATT: Apparently.

00:01:07.055 --> 00:01:09.703
MARISHA: Are you reaching Godfather status?

00:01:09.703 --> 00:01:11.972
TALIESIN: I like my nickname for you during game.

00:01:11.972 --> 00:01:14.879
MATT: It's technically Poppy Mercer, but we're not
going to--

00:01:16.312 --> 00:01:18.042
MARISHA: I think my chair's broken.

00:01:18.042 --> 00:01:19.073
MATT: Oh no.

00:01:19.073 --> 00:01:20.492
TALIESIN: We got an extra chair. Do you want to
just--

00:01:20.492 --> 00:01:23.678
MARISHA: My chair, the seat might fall out.

00:01:23.678 --> 00:01:26.316
TALIESIN: Throw the chair back.

00:01:26.316 --> 00:01:31.521
VOICE OVER: As all of you start filing in, please
make sure that you're not leaving seats open. We

00:01:31.521 --> 00:01:40.203
need to pack it in. Elbow room is not really
optional here. Thank you for your cooperation.

00:01:40.203 --> 00:01:43.402
MATT: Be patient!

00:01:43.402 --> 00:01:45.568
VOICE OVER: We appreciate you coming to MomoCon.

00:01:45.568 --> 00:01:48.035
HANNAH: This is going to be so much fun, you
guys.

00:01:48.035 --> 00:01:59.627
MATT: (evil laugh) We now have dice up here. That
means games of chance are possible. Or I'll eat

00:01:59.627 --> 00:02:08.067
them... keep them away from me. They look tasty.
They look really sparkly.

00:02:09.778 --> 00:02:14.479
HANNAH: I would like to remind everybody that dice
are a choking hazard. Do not eat them.

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:20.892
MATT: Yes, this is true. Thank you for the dice!
We're just patiently waiting for the rest of the

00:02:20.892 --> 00:02:22.220
folks to sit in.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:28.188
TALIESIN: Okay, that's what we're waiting for.
There's people who are coming in. I just got off a

00:02:28.188 --> 00:02:30.212
plane. This is the best I got right now.

00:02:30.212 --> 00:02:32.614
MATT: It's true. Well, you still have technically
six minutes until the panel starts, so--

00:02:32.614 --> 00:02:36.006
TALIESIN: Well that's cool. We can talk amongst
ourselves, then. That's not bad.

00:02:36.006 --> 00:02:37.150
MARISHA: It's all right. It's all right.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.157
TALIESIN: It's not bad.

00:02:38.157 --> 00:02:39.380
MATT: You get to reroll the ones, though.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:46.994
MARISHA: I do get to reroll ones if it's elemental
damage. Re-rolling that one.

00:02:46.994 --> 00:02:47.988
MATT: Respectable.

00:02:47.988 --> 00:02:50.366
MARISHA: It's pretty good. It's all right. It's
above average.

00:02:50.366 --> 00:02:56.737
MATT: It's pretty average. Numerically!

00:02:56.737 --> 00:02:57.920
TALIESIN: Oh! Okay.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.649
MATT: Okay, there you go.

00:02:59.649 --> 00:03:03.230
HANNAH: All right everybody, we're going to get
started. Are you guys ready?

00:03:03.247 --> 00:03:04.572
MARISHA: Yeah!

00:03:04.572 --> 00:03:08.195
(cheering)

00:03:08.195 --> 00:03:11.474
HANNAH: I get two? Are my panelists ready?

00:03:11.474 --> 00:03:12.791
MATT: Yes, you ready?

00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:13.745
TALIESIN, MARISHA, and MATT: Yeah. Yes!

00:03:13.745 --> 00:03:16.076
HANNAH: Excellent! Okay, let's do this!

00:03:16.076 --> 00:03:21.968
MATT: Oh no, now you're all just anonymous shades.
This panel just got really creepy from our

00:03:21.968 --> 00:03:26.141
perspective, and I like it. It feels like we're
being judged.

00:03:26.141 --> 00:03:30.208
TALIESIN: This is like Act Three of the Rocky
Horror Picture Show. Just really disturbing.

00:03:30.208 --> 00:03:34.242
MARISHA: A really low budget VR horror game
happening right now.

00:03:34.242 --> 00:03:37.179
MATT: It's like the ghosts of our ancestors
judging us in the final moments.

00:03:37.179 --> 00:03:44.439
MARISHA: Yeah. "What do you will of me, council?
What do you want?"

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:46.258
MATT: Right, anyway, sorry, this is your panel.

00:03:46.258 --> 00:03:50.338
HANNAH: No, it's all good, you guys are hilarious
and I love you. Okay! Welcome, everybody, to

00:03:50.338 --> 00:03:52.398
Critical Role!

00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:55.690
(cheering)

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.056
MATT: You are, of course, Taliesin Jaffe, our
fantastic moderator.

00:03:59.056 --> 00:04:05.671
HANNAH: Yes, I am, hello. Actually, my name's
Hannah, and I will be moderating for all of you

00:04:05.671 --> 00:04:07.601
lovelies.

00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:12.768
(cheering)

00:04:12.768 --> 00:04:16.530
HANNAH: I cannot give these guys a proper
introduction, because you all know them and you

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.013
love them. I'm going to let them do it, because
they're fantastic.

00:04:20.013 --> 00:04:21.547
MATT: Hi, I'm Matt.

00:04:21.547 --> 00:04:23.551
(laughter)

00:04:23.551 --> 00:04:32.800
MARISHA: Oh my god, Brian Foster, who is
apparently supposed to be on this panel!

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.796
(cheering)

00:04:37.796 --> 00:04:41.365
MARISHA: I'm sorry Taliesin told you you weren't
supposed to be on this panel, and I didn't have

00:04:41.365 --> 00:04:42.681
anything to do with it.

00:04:42.681 --> 00:04:47.177
BRIAN: Where is my chair?

00:04:47.177 --> 00:04:52.139
TALIESIN: One of them is broken. Just make sure
that's not the one.

00:04:55.968 --> 00:04:57.473
BRIAN: Feels good to me, guys.

00:04:57.473 --> 00:04:58.731
TALIESIN: All right.

00:04:58.731 --> 00:05:00.558
BRIAN: This is really funny.

00:05:00.558 --> 00:05:02.137
MATT: All right. So you are?

00:05:02.137 --> 00:05:04.417
MARISHA: Oh, I'm Marisha Ray.

00:05:04.417 --> 00:05:08.744
(cheering)

00:05:08.744 --> 00:05:18.151
MARISHA: A.K.A. Keyleth. A.K.A. hashtag
ThanksKeyleth. A.K.A. Goldengods. Yeah, we're

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:20.511
basically gods.

00:05:23.251 --> 00:05:31.511
TALIESIN: I'm Taliesin Jaffe. A.K.A. Percy. Percy
de Rolo the third. A.K.A. the port for all ships,

00:05:31.511 --> 00:05:33.415
apparently. Which is
very exciting.

00:05:33.415 --> 00:05:37.671
(laughter)

00:05:37.671 --> 00:05:51.366
BRIAN: Hello. I am the host with the most. A.K.A.
the grandma killer. That's not good. No, I'm

00:05:51.366 --> 00:05:55.529
Brian, with an 'i.' '

00:05:55.529 --> 00:06:00.409
(applause)

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:02.217
HANNAH: Well it's fantastic to have all of you
here.

00:06:02.217 --> 00:06:03.455
MATT: Happy to be here.

00:06:03.455 --> 00:06:08.814
HANNAH: Very happy that you're here. Let's just
kick it off. Let's just jump into it. For

00:06:08.814 --> 00:06:14.009
everybody that wants to be a voice actor here, I
thought I'd throw out the question: how would you

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:17.152
guys normally prepare for a voice acting role?

00:06:17.152 --> 00:06:26.587
MATT: Okay, prepare for a voice acting role. I
would recommend reading the lines for the

00:06:26.587 --> 00:06:27.948
audition.

00:06:27.948 --> 00:06:29.539
TALIESIN: Fuck.

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:30.823
MARISHA: That was going to be your--

00:06:30.823 --> 00:06:32.839
MATT: Yeah. Sorry.

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:38.250
BRIAN: Do you charge for this great advice?
Reading a script.

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:43.991
MATT: We can work out classes, Brian. No, I mean,
and I've emphasized this at other panels before,

00:06:43.991 --> 00:06:51.567
voice acting is 90 percent acting, ten percent
voice. And so, for preparation, not just for the

00:06:51.567 --> 00:06:55.557
industry in general, but for any sort of character
role that comes your way, is prepare it like you

00:06:55.557 --> 00:07:00.714
would any character. You want to read the
dialogue, get a feel for the personality, take

00:07:00.714 --> 00:07:04.830
whatever information is given to you about that
character and then extrapolate from that to help

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:13.076
flesh them out. A lot of times, you get, "He's 25
to 35, parents died in a fire, uses a machine

00:07:13.076 --> 00:07:14.068
gun."

00:07:14.068 --> 00:07:15.056
TALIESIN: Blood type B.

00:07:15.056 --> 00:07:17.450
Every now and then you get blood type.
I'm not kidding.

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:20.477
MARISHA: Yeah. Or the guy you'd like to have a
beer with.

00:07:20.477 --> 00:07:24.600
MATT: Yeah. Japan's really into their blood types
and America's really into their "Have a beer

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.713
with."

00:07:25.713 --> 00:07:27.706
MARISHA: Yeah, guy you'd like to have a beer with.

00:07:27.706 --> 00:07:31.223
MATT: At least my first thing would be to make
sure that you take the time to try and create a

00:07:31.223 --> 00:07:36.738
character that feels fleshed out to you and don't
feel too beholden to what little information you

00:07:36.738 --> 00:07:39.991
have there. Just find something that you feel is
honest in the performance.

00:07:39.991 --> 00:07:43.615
MARISHA: I love that it feels like that you're
calling the world series right now. From

00:07:43.615 --> 00:07:44.673
everyone--

00:07:44.673 --> 00:07:45.666
MATT: "And the back row--"

00:07:45.666 --> 00:07:46.703
MARISHA: --the reverberation. Yeah.

00:07:46.703 --> 00:07:50.445
TALIESIN: Is it hard to understand us, or is it
relatively--? Okay, good.

00:07:50.445 --> 00:07:53.893
MARISHA: It's just us I think. We're hearing it.

00:07:53.893 --> 00:07:54.891
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:57.420
BRIAN: It's slapping back against the back wall.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:06.238
MARISHA: "Welcome, welcome, welcome, to Wednesday
Wrestlemania!" is what it feels like.

00:08:06.238 --> 00:08:10.033
TALIESIN: That's a different panel.

00:08:10.033 --> 00:08:11.881
BRIAN: That's after this.

00:08:11.881 --> 00:08:14.706
MATT: Brian, how do you prepare for a voiceover
role?

00:08:14.706 --> 00:08:19.522
BRIAN: Well, I prepare-- typically, I stretch.

00:08:19.522 --> 00:08:21.544
(laughter)

00:08:21.544 --> 00:08:28.105
BRIAN: I call Steve Blum and I say, hey man,
before I audition for this part you're going to

00:08:28.105 --> 00:08:37.820
get. No, I'm not a voice actor, but I do hang out
with a lot of them. And I can tell you that they

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:46.212
do prepare a lot of stuff. And the people on this
stage-- I think Taliesin Jaffe should be playing

00:08:46.212 --> 00:08:48.343
every villain in every video game.

00:08:48.343 --> 00:08:49.703
MATT: Yes!

00:08:49.703 --> 00:08:56.952
BRIAN: And I've been saying that for years and I
will continue to say that until the video game

00:08:56.952 --> 00:09:01.111
makers will listen to me.

00:09:01.111 --> 00:09:06.668
MARISHA: It's true, though. There's been a few
times that me, as a very supportive girlfriend,

00:09:06.668 --> 00:09:11.618
Matt's gotten sides in and I've been like, "Aw,
babe, just, Taliesin.'

00:09:11.618 --> 00:09:14.477
BRIAN: Just hand that over to Taliesin.

00:09:14.477 --> 00:09:22.661
MARISHA: Hearing him read through the wall and I'm
like, it's not good. Just give it to Taliesin.

00:09:22.661 --> 00:09:27.648
MATT: Yeah. I've been requested to go and audition
on roles, and I've told them in the room, "I mean

00:09:27.648 --> 00:09:30.568
thanks, but you should really get Taliesin in for
this."

00:09:30.568 --> 00:09:34.265
TALIESIN: This is an industry, where occasionally
some of us go in to read for something and we're

00:09:34.265 --> 00:09:37.782
like, are you having these five people in for
this? I know I just read for this, but you should

00:09:37.782 --> 00:09:42.464
really have these other five people read this,
because I'm sure what I did was great and all, but

00:09:42.464 --> 00:09:46.451
this is a Patrick Seitz role. What are you doing?
Come on. Let's not kid ourselves here.

00:09:46.451 --> 00:09:50.370
MARISHA: My favorite is when I get a voice
reference and it's Laura Bailey.

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:51.675
(laughter)

00:09:51.675 --> 00:09:57.172
MARISHA: I'm not kidding. This happens all the
time, and I'm like, "Do you want me to text her?

00:09:57.172 --> 00:09:59.925
Yo, you free? Wednesday?"

00:09:59.925 --> 00:10:04.767
TALIESIN: Before-- my voice just recently cracked
a little bit-- so before that I used to--

00:10:04.767 --> 00:10:07.127
BRIAN: Puberty.

00:10:07.127 --> 00:10:08.576
MATT: We were all waiting!

00:10:08.576 --> 00:10:14.167
TALIESIN: It's crazy. Second puberty. I used to
get paired up with Liam and now that's stopped

00:10:14.167 --> 00:10:15.716
happening which is really nice.

00:10:15.716 --> 00:10:17.387
MARISHA: You always have people that are--

00:10:17.387 --> 00:10:18.980
TALIESIN: Yeah, who you're right there with.

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:21.982
MARISHA: Yeah. Me and Courtenay Taylor. Every
time.

00:10:21.982 --> 00:10:27.329
MATT: You mentioned hearing voice matches of Laura
Bailey. I remember when they did the live action

00:10:27.329 --> 00:10:32.247
Resident Evil movie that had Leon in it, because
apparently the actor that played him had a French

00:10:32.247 --> 00:10:36.057
accent, so they wanted someone to dub his lines
and sound like Leon, so they sent out an audition

00:10:36.057 --> 00:10:44.964
to try and match the sounds, and the audio clip
was me. I was the reference. And I didn't book it.

00:10:44.964 --> 00:10:51.336
I'm genuinely really curious to meet whoever it
was that did a better me than me. I haven't found

00:10:51.336 --> 00:10:56.959
him yet, but one day. I hope that helped you learn
some tips and tricks about voice over!

00:10:56.959 --> 00:10:58.386
TALIESIN: The most random voice over.

00:10:58.386 --> 00:11:04.535
MARISHA: Yeah, I mean the real tips that you can
get are just buy Voice-Over Voice Actor by Yuri

00:11:04.535 --> 00:11:13.541
Lowenthal and Tara Platt. Go to How To Be A Voice
Actor.com by Dee Bradley Baker.

00:11:13.541 --> 00:11:17.579
BRIAN: Find any panel that Fred Tatasciore is at
this weekend.

00:11:17.579 --> 00:11:25.655
MARISHA: Yeah, go talk to Fred, he's here. There's
so many resources out there that are written down,

00:11:25.655 --> 00:11:29.365
and probably way more eloquent than what we could
tell you right now.

00:11:29.365 --> 00:11:32.454
TALIESIN: Yeah, Yuri's book is great, very
helpful.

00:11:32.454 --> 00:11:36.401
MATT: These title cards are more eloquent than
any of us right now.

00:11:36.401 --> 00:11:40.262
TALIESIN: Voice good, panel hard.

00:11:40.262 --> 00:11:46.987
MATT: Flight long. Thank you.

00:11:46.987 --> 00:11:54.426
HANNAH: Y'all are way too modest, like jeez, come
on now. Off of that, I know you guys know how hard

00:11:54.426 --> 00:11:59.590
being in the industry is, and not only being an
actor, but also being a voice actor on top of

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:05.412
that. I was wondering if you guys could talk to us
a little bit more about what the hardest parts of

00:12:05.412 --> 00:12:09.721
being in the industry are. What struggles have you
had?

00:12:09.721 --> 00:12:10.843
MATT: Who wants to jump off on that one?

00:12:10.843 --> 00:12:11.836
TALIESIN: Oh wow.

00:12:11.836 --> 00:12:18.301
MARISHA: I mean honestly, being a voice-over actor
is the easier parts of being in the industry.

00:12:18.301 --> 00:12:20.738
On-camera is scary.

00:12:20.738 --> 00:12:25.723
TALIESIN: I used to describe it to my friends with
real jobs as it's trading the illusion of security

00:12:25.723 --> 00:12:28.532
for the illusion of freedom.

00:12:28.532 --> 00:12:30.757
MATT and MARISHA: That's a really good way of
putting it.

00:12:30.757 --> 00:12:34.204
TALIESIN: You can either have the illusion of a
job that's not going anywhere that's going to be

00:12:34.204 --> 00:12:38.667
there for the rest of your life, or you can have
the illusion that you can do anything you like,

00:12:38.667 --> 00:12:43.767
and leave your house and go on vacation any time
you like because you don't have a boss and you're

00:12:43.767 --> 00:12:47.820
your own boss, and your office is just your house
and your bedroom. And there's no reason to ever

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:52.203
leave your bedroom because you've got work to do.
And sleep is really a bad use of your office

00:12:52.203 --> 00:12:56.083
really-- And why are you sleeping? Weekends are
for people who have real jobs! What are you--

00:12:56.083 --> 00:12:57.079
Yeah.

00:12:57.079 --> 00:13:03.941
MARISHA: Oh god! Let's go to the Bourgeois Pig!
This'll fix everything!

00:13:03.941 --> 00:13:07.004
BRIAN: Hey, say the first part again, for those of
us who are going to put it in the yearbook. What

00:13:07.004 --> 00:13:09.214
was the first thing you said?

00:13:09.214 --> 00:13:12.980
TALIESIN: The illusion of security versus the
illusion of freedom? Yeah, you trade the illusion

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:15.215
of security for the illusion of freedom.

00:13:15.215 --> 00:13:19.552
MARISHA: What we tell everybody is when you go to
interview for your job, and you do it once and

00:13:19.552 --> 00:13:25.600
you're like whew, awesome. We do that every day.
Every time you audition it's basically the

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:30.777
equivalent of interviewing for your job and trying
to convince people why you should be there. The

00:13:30.777 --> 00:13:38.049
reality is, you shouldn't, no one should be, it's
a desert. It's, there's a serious water shortage

00:13:38.049 --> 00:13:42.550
you guys, no one should be there.

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:47.309
TALIESIN: The phrase I hear in my head every time
I walk out of a booth is, "Well, this is it.

00:13:47.309 --> 00:13:53.009
That's the last job you're ever going to book.
It's been a great run, you've done very well, but

00:13:53.009 --> 00:13:54.342
it's all over now."

00:13:54.342 --> 00:13:58.495
BRIAN: That's just Sam telling you that after you
leave the booth.

00:13:58.495 --> 00:14:02.505
TALIESIN:It's time to go back and work at the
video store. Oh man.

00:14:02.505 --> 00:14:07.820
BRIAN: Yeah. Well, I'm a writer, so I'm not
subject to the persecutions of the voice actors,

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:09.475
but I am--

00:14:09.475 --> 00:14:11.516
TALIESIN: You get discount coffee at the Bourgeois
Pig.

00:14:11.516 --> 00:14:16.861
BRIAN: I do get discount coffee there. Well, I'm
not allowed there anymore, but some places I get a

00:14:16.861 --> 00:14:17.870
discount.

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:20.149
TALIESIN: It's nice that they can look at you and
they're like, "Oh writer, okay. Yeah."

00:14:20.149 --> 00:14:25.723
BRIAN: Yeah, exactly. They're like that's a
writer's beard. And then I take it off and--

00:14:25.723 --> 00:14:29.145
TALIESIN: It's not a beard for anybody who
actually has to audition for anything.

00:14:29.145 --> 00:14:41.335
BRIAN: Yeah, or be anywhere. No, but the business
is the same regardless of which genre you're in,

00:14:41.335 --> 00:14:46.057
if you're an actor, if you're a writer, if you're
a producer, whatever you're trying to... You're

00:14:46.057 --> 00:14:52.657
trying to tell a story and you're trying to make a
point, and you're trying to be relevant while at

00:14:52.657 --> 00:14:57.138
the same time trying to be yourself, and so you're
in a place where there's thousands and millions of

00:14:57.138 --> 00:15:03.178
people trying that at the same time. You're hoping
something cuts through. Critical Role is an

00:15:03.178 --> 00:15:09.819
incredible example of something that has no reason
to cut through the way it did. Like really, it

00:15:09.819 --> 00:15:17.717
doesn't, and we talk about that all the time, but it
has resonated with people, in a way that I think

00:15:17.717 --> 00:15:23.030
"good art" connects us to, and makes us have an
intimate connection with enough to where we're

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:29.761
willing to-- some people drove and flew a long way
just to meet the three of you.

00:15:29.771 --> 00:15:30.774
MARISHA: And you!

00:15:30.774 --> 00:15:31.768
BRIAN: It's crazy!

00:15:31.768 --> 00:15:35.599
MARISHA: Dude, people are cosplaying as Brian
Wayne Foster, okay.

00:15:35.599 --> 00:15:38.750
BRIAN: There are cats now, that's what I'm excited
about.

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:40.089
MATT: Well it--

00:15:40.089 --> 00:15:45.988
MARISHA: Oh, sorry. I feel like every artist or
every creative wakes up one morning and starts

00:15:45.988 --> 00:15:50.439
having this existential crisis of, "Oh my god,
everything that I do for a living is just made up.

00:15:50.439 --> 00:15:55.445
I just make up shit. Oh my god, nothing is real,
what am I doing. Why are people paying me for

00:15:55.445 --> 00:15:56.988
shit, this is all a bad idea."

00:15:56.988 --> 00:15:59.156
TALIESIN: We all spent six months just saying "what is
happening?"

00:15:59.156 --> 00:16:01.485
MARISHA: What is happening, this is weird, why are
people watching this?

00:16:01.485 --> 00:16:05.490
MATT: To work the entertainment industry, and be a
somewhat sane human being means you're a

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:12.752
professional harbinger of impostor syndrome. It is
a perpetual process, and in a weird way it's kind

00:16:12.752 --> 00:16:14.160
of healthy.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:19.762
TALIESIN: You have such a solid respect for-- I
was directing Erica Lindbeck in some show ages

00:16:19.762 --> 00:16:28.334
ago, and we had this really fascinating,
interesting professor of Medieval Language or

00:16:28.334 --> 00:16:32.026
something he was in, and he was like, "Well,
you've worked hard to get where you are," and

00:16:32.026 --> 00:16:36.789
Erica, bless her, was like, "No, there are people
who have worked way harder than me that have

00:16:36.789 --> 00:16:41.884
nothing, I'm just really lucky!" He's like, "Don't
sell yourself short," she's, "No, you don't

00:16:41.884 --> 00:16:48.415
understand how this works! There's a hundred
people just as talented as me, I'm just really

00:16:48.415 --> 00:16:49.424
lucky!"

00:16:49.424 --> 00:16:52.881
MATT: Four of them are in the parking lot with
knives right now!

00:16:52.881 --> 00:16:55.610
MATT: Can I ride home with you?

00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:01.684
TALIESIN: You have a really healthy respect for
luck in this industry.

00:17:01.684 --> 00:17:06.625
BRIAN: I tell people that I slept my way all the
way to the bottom.

00:17:06.625 --> 00:17:10.857
TALIESIN: What you mean is you napped all your way
to the bottom, let's make one thing clear.

00:17:10.857 --> 00:17:17.528
MATT: Now, on a legitimate point too, it is a job,
especially for voice-over, that is built on

00:17:17.528 --> 00:17:24.926
perpetual rejection. It is a career that, you do
the work before it's decided whether or not you're

00:17:24.926 --> 00:17:30.743
paid for it. To play off what you were saying
before, it's working, you're doing your two weeks

00:17:30.743 --> 00:17:34.869
at your job and you have to re-interview every two
weeks for your paycheck after doing the work. And

00:17:34.869 --> 00:17:40.876
so it has to be a passion. You have to do it, not
to make an extravagant living, because we'll all

00:17:40.876 --> 00:17:46.634
profess, that's not going to happen usually, you
might be able to get by if you work really hard,

00:17:46.634 --> 00:17:52.567
but each of us has spent countless years in
squalor trying to make something like this happen.

00:17:52.567 --> 00:17:57.161
You have to be able to push through the rejection,
do it for the art of it, do it for the love of it,

00:17:57.161 --> 00:18:01.710
and maintain being a good person. Because
voice-over, more than any other form of

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:07.043
entertainment, does not really allow for
douchebags to persevere.

00:18:07.043 --> 00:18:08.761
TALIESIN: No, we're a small community.

00:18:08.761 --> 00:18:11.286
MARISHA: Yeah, we eat douchebags for breakfast.

00:18:11.286 --> 00:18:14.078
MATT: I would not quote that.

00:18:14.078 --> 00:18:17.469
TALIESIN: It's weird that they come in breakfast
cereal form now actually.

00:18:17.469 --> 00:18:20.071
BRIAN: I'm going to sit with that one for a little
bit.

00:18:20.071 --> 00:18:23.320
MATT: That's the yearbook quote from the panel to
take home with you guys.

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:31.168
TALIESIN: Douchebags for breakfast.

00:18:31.168 --> 00:18:33.635
MATT: The answer to that question is we eat
douchebags for breakfast.

00:18:33.635 --> 00:18:41.557
HANNAH: Okay. That will be accepted. It's
interesting you guys talk about how you got your

00:18:41.557 --> 00:18:49.315
start, and how difficult it is to break in, and
Matt I know that you started in high school,

00:18:49.315 --> 00:18:50.614
correct?

00:18:50.614 --> 00:18:52.228
MATT: Right, the tail end of high school.

00:18:52.228 --> 00:18:58.225
HANNAH: Right, so what was that like, still trying
to get a GED and working and figuring that out,

00:18:58.225 --> 00:18:59.233
what was that like?

00:18:59.233 --> 00:19:05.885
MATT: Oh, it sucked! To put it into context here,
I wasn't considering pursuing voice-over when I

00:19:05.885 --> 00:19:09.608
was in high school, I was just getting into
theater heavily and I was enjoying the performing

00:19:09.608 --> 00:19:13.561
aspect of it, but I was going to go into
animation, I grew up watching and loving cartoons

00:19:13.561 --> 00:19:17.828
and I wanted to be an illustrator, an animator.
And right as I was getting to the end of my high

00:19:17.828 --> 00:19:23.895
school years I realized, "I-- no-- scary. I don't
want to--" That was not something I was as passionate

00:19:23.895 --> 00:19:30.219
about as I thought I was, and that also requires
passion in the face of rejection. I had an

00:19:30.219 --> 00:19:37.097
opportunity through a strange connection to do
background voices in one series. When I say

00:19:37.097 --> 00:19:41.218
background voices I don't mean you got to be a
side character, this was like, "Guy's head who

00:19:41.218 --> 00:19:48.305
explodes number seven," or "Guy whose car gets
stolen and goes 'No!'" That kind of thing.

00:19:48.305 --> 00:19:49.961
TALIESIN: Was that Mag 8?

00:19:49.961 --> 00:19:53.026
MATT: That was the Mag 8, that was for the Fist of
the North Star animated series.

00:19:53.026 --> 00:19:54.761
TALIESIN: (Groans) Oh my god!

00:19:54.761 --> 00:19:59.304
MATT: I got to be one of those guys whose head
exploded. But it was just enough of a taste for me

00:19:59.304 --> 00:20:08.382
to go, "Oh. Okay, this is a thing, and maybe this
connection will help me." Didn't at all. But it

00:20:08.382 --> 00:20:13.761
was enough of a taste to really let me start
focusing on that. A lot of my time after that was

00:20:13.761 --> 00:20:18.744
just thinking, well, what can I do to maybe
someday pursue this? I began to continue doing

00:20:18.744 --> 00:20:26.714
theater, taking classes, learning, trying to just
better myself, and then it wasn't until eight

00:20:26.714 --> 00:20:31.483
years later, back in about 2008 or so, that I
finally quit my job, and was like, let me take

00:20:31.483 --> 00:20:38.336
this full on, and fail. Or succeed. You know, I
prefer not to live with regret, I think regret's a

00:20:38.336 --> 00:20:42.024
terrible thing, and I'd rather fail and know that
I tried and move on to the next endeavor, than

00:20:42.024 --> 00:20:44.477
spend the rest of my life going, "What if?"

00:20:44.477 --> 00:20:45.816
HANNAH: That must have been so scary, though.

00:20:45.816 --> 00:20:46.900
MATT: Oh, it was really scary!

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:47.914
HANNAH: Yeah!

00:20:47.914 --> 00:20:53.211
MATT: I downsized my entire life. I had to go down
to this tiny studio apartment, and Marisha saw it,

00:20:53.211 --> 00:20:57.069
when we first met, I had a kitch.

00:20:57.069 --> 00:21:00.386
TALIESIN: We still have friends who live in that
apartment, actually. That apartment is still in

00:21:00.386 --> 00:21:05.147
our friends' family, we're like, you'll get out of
here one day.

00:21:05.147 --> 00:21:08.659
MATT: The Sisterhood of the Travelling Box. That's
what it has become.

00:21:08.659 --> 00:21:11.134
TALIESIN: It's a pretty depressing place.

00:21:11.134 --> 00:21:17.163
MATT: It was doing temp work and odd jobs off
Craigslist, and whatever I could to try and pay

00:21:17.163 --> 00:21:21.627
the bills, working as a barista at a Barnes &amp;
Noble cafe for a long time, working in warehouses

00:21:21.627 --> 00:21:27.137
stocking shelves, whatever I could do to allow me
the time to continue to pursue this. It took a lot

00:21:27.137 --> 00:21:34.704
of years of busting my ass and trying to make it
happen and slowly getting traction. But it wasn't

00:21:34.704 --> 00:21:36.522
an easy climb.

00:21:36.522 --> 00:21:43.165
HANNAH: I bet. Okay, so for the rest of the panel,
let's hear it, what was you guys' moment?

00:21:43.165 --> 00:21:47.761
BRIAN: I was sending Ashley a picture.
Ashley asked for a picture, I sent a picture.

00:21:47.761 --> 00:21:50.431
No, the back of Matt's head looks beautiful.

00:21:50.431 --> 00:21:58.700
MATT: Thank you. I think it's great that I can
distinctly sense the type of laughter that is

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:00.866
evoked by Brian Foster.

00:22:00.866 --> 00:22:04.513
(laughter)

00:22:04.513 --> 00:22:06.610
MATT: Just an observation. Anyway, sorry, continue
with your question.

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:12.471
HANNAH: No, that's fine. Miss Marisha, tell us: how
did you get your start? What was your lucky

00:22:12.471 --> 00:22:14.061
moment?

00:22:15.781 --> 00:22:20.329
MARISHA: Ooh. Oh no.

00:22:20.329 --> 00:22:22.226
TALIESIN: Maybe another story.

00:22:22.226 --> 00:22:31.997
MARISHA: Oh no, this is a long story, you guys.
I dunno, are there any singular lucky breaks?

00:22:31.997 --> 00:22:35.691
MATT: For some people, but not really for us I
don't think.

00:22:35.691 --> 00:22:38.639
BRIAN: Weren't you the Cash Me Outside, How 'Bout
Dat girl?

00:22:38.639 --> 00:22:42.971
(laughter)

00:22:42.971 --> 00:22:48.624
BRIAN: That's what I told them at the airport to
try and get us upgraded to first class, but they

00:22:48.624 --> 00:22:52.127
Googled her and they were like, that ain't her.

00:22:52.127 --> 00:23:00.878
MARISHA: Always bet on Mercer. Always bet on him.
No, I mean, I feel like my career and my success,

00:23:00.878 --> 00:23:08.691
when you look back in that introspective timeline
of your life, and it was all these little nudges

00:23:08.691 --> 00:23:14.883
and hints, just pushing me into the same
direction, and these weird little trail of events

00:23:14.883 --> 00:23:25.129
that happened that lead me one thing to another. I
am obnoxiously tenacious, like maybe to a damaging

00:23:25.129 --> 00:23:27.641
degree, sometimes.

00:23:27.641 --> 00:23:28.698
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Goldfish!

00:23:28.698 --> 00:23:39.859
MARISHA: Goldfish is very indicative of that! I
hate hearing no for an answer. Shouldn't say that

00:23:39.859 --> 00:23:46.333
out loud, either, that's probably damaging. But
yeah, I turn into that toddler who's like four

00:23:46.333 --> 00:23:52.217
years old that's like, "Well why can't I do this?
Why?" And it's like, "Well, that's because if you

00:23:52.217 --> 00:23:58.805
jump off a cliff, you'll die." "Why?" "Well,
gravity and terminal vel--" "Why?!" And I just

00:23:58.805 --> 00:24:02.214
keep asking why until something happens.

00:24:02.214 --> 00:24:05.121
MATT: Or conversely, "You can't play this because
you're a woman."

00:24:05.121 --> 00:24:06.435
MARISHA: "Why?"

00:24:06.435 --> 00:24:08.923
MATT: "You can't do this job as good because
you're a woman."

00:24:08.923 --> 00:24:09.930
MARISHA: "Why?"

00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:13.013
MATT: You just keep pushing until eventually they
don't have an answer for it.

00:24:13.013 --> 00:24:16.778
MARISHA: Yeah, break people down with their own
defense.

00:24:16.778 --> 00:24:22.463
TALIESIN: You always remind me of the Jason C. Lee
character from Mallrats. I feel like I've been in

00:24:22.463 --> 00:24:26.073
so many rooms that started with, "Just because a
chick reads comic books, you think she can't start

00:24:26.073 --> 00:24:32.696
some shit?! I'll kick your ass!" Whoa, no! Run!

00:24:32.696 --> 00:24:37.145
MARISHA: That's true. There has been like one
maybe two times that Taliesin has been to me,

00:24:37.145 --> 00:24:40.057
"Leave, Marisha. Go. Out."

00:24:40.057 --> 00:24:42.221
MATT: Before <i>you</i> stab someone, yeah.

00:24:42.221 --> 00:24:49.854
TALIESIN: Yeah, never because, yeah, it's always
the-- I don't want to go explain this to the cops

00:24:49.854 --> 00:24:51.862
later.

00:24:51.862 --> 00:24:54.167
HANNAH: No, we want to hear that story, what's
that story?

00:24:54.167 --> 00:24:56.182
TALIESIN: Oh god.

00:24:56.182 --> 00:25:02.919
MARISHA: That story? There's too many stories.
But, no, I don't know, there's been--

00:25:02.919 --> 00:25:05.686
BRIAN: Keyleth isn't the only one who's been to
jail.

00:25:05.686 --> 00:25:13.161
MARISHA: A strong perseverance and hard-
headedness, and honestly just constantly

00:25:13.161 --> 00:25:19.937
pursuing what made me happy in what I knew I
wanted to do. That ended up putting me at a

00:25:19.937 --> 00:25:25.059
crossroads of acting and nerddom, and it was
perfect.

00:25:25.059 --> 00:25:31.439
BRIAN: I will say passion, though, because
Marisha, even if she's just asked to help

00:25:31.439 --> 00:25:38.751
participate in something or help step in to assist
with something tiny, she treats it as if it was an

00:25:38.751 --> 00:25:45.986
idea she came up with. She treats it with that
same amount of passion. I'll say that's why now

00:25:45.986 --> 00:25:52.072
she's becoming more famous than all of us and
she'll forget us soon.

00:25:52.072 --> 00:25:53.448
TALIESIN: Well you, yeah.

00:25:53.448 --> 00:25:55.184
BRIAN: Me first, yeah.

00:25:55.184 --> 00:25:56.183
TALIESIN: You're the first to go.

00:25:56.183 --> 00:25:58.699
BRIAN: The new guy has got to go first.

00:25:58.699 --> 00:26:00.078
MARISHA: Thanks, man.

00:26:00.078 --> 00:26:01.929
BRIAN: You're welcome. I'll invoice you later.

00:26:01.929 --> 00:26:07.343
MARISHA: Yeah. Best 50 bucks I ever spent.

00:26:07.343 --> 00:26:12.998
TALIESIN: I can think of several examples that are
probably not true on that. Some good stories,

00:26:12.998 --> 00:26:18.295
sorry. I beg to differ.

00:26:18.295 --> 00:26:21.657
BRIAN: Us jet-lagged, it turns out, is awesome.

00:26:21.657 --> 00:26:23.202
TALIESIN: I am so amused.

00:26:23.202 --> 00:26:24.486
BRIAN: Let's do this every day.

00:26:24.486 --> 00:26:26.077
MATT: This is before drinking, guys.

00:26:26.077 --> 00:26:28.825
TALIESIN: I didn't have a moment.

00:26:28.825 --> 00:26:31.647
MATT: You didn't have a chance to, you were thrust
into the industry as a child.

00:26:31.647 --> 00:26:37.643
TALIESIN: I was born into this. I worked
as a child actor. I was in the

00:26:37.643 --> 00:26:43.804
union before I was one years old, I had a SAG
card. I was doing this solidly until the age of

00:26:43.804 --> 00:26:47.302
approximately 13 working on-camera.

00:26:47.302 --> 00:26:48.521
BRIAN: You could've been Boss Baby.

00:26:48.521 --> 00:26:59.099
TALIESIN: I could've been Boss Baby. "Yeah, never
going to happen." Even back then I was really

00:26:59.099 --> 00:27:02.830
interested in Japanese cartoons and Japanese
animations, which hadn't really become a thing

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:06.984
yet, but I was really into it. I was excited by
the notion that they were going to be dubbing them

00:27:06.984 --> 00:27:12.010
into English, and we were still figuring out how
that worked. And because I was in the industry and

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:17.332
working all the time I came at it in that
direction of "Well, how are we going to do this?

00:27:17.332 --> 00:27:21.213
What kind of acting are you going to use for this?
What kind of actors are you going to get? This is

00:27:21.213 --> 00:27:29.639
interesting." From having that perspective, I
managed to interest enough people who found that

00:27:29.639 --> 00:27:37.459
amusing to start a career in that direction. At
that time I was going to stop doing on-camera work

00:27:37.459 --> 00:27:38.709
because--

00:27:38.709 --> 00:27:39.894
BRIAN: Baywatch.

00:27:39.894 --> 00:27:42.423
TALIESIN: The Baywatch story, which is
definitely a story.

00:27:42.423 --> 00:27:43.844
MARISHA and BRIAN: Tell the story!

00:27:43.844 --> 00:27:47.517
TALIESIN: I'll tell the Baywatch story, okay.

00:27:47.517 --> 00:27:49.220
MATT: Taliesin, tell the Baywatch story.

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:53.775
TALIESIN: I'm telling the Baywatch story. I was 13
years old, I had the worst haircut on Earth,

00:27:53.775 --> 00:27:58.320
because it's the hair cut you have to-- if you're
an actor, you have to have actor hair.

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:01.140
I'm not kidding, you can't mess with your
hair because you have a photo,

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:03.746
and when they call you in, you got to look
like that photo, and that photo has to have

00:28:03.746 --> 00:28:07.663
just enough hair that if they want to do
something to it, they can, but not so

00:28:07.663 --> 00:28:13.121
little hair that you're stuck with the haircut you
have. You have to have the bowl haircut boyish

00:28:13.121 --> 00:28:18.297
thing that's awful, and you have to have it all
the time until they want to mess with it.

00:28:18.297 --> 00:28:22.363
MARISHA: Photos are expensive. Change your hair,
you have to take more pictures.

00:28:22.363 --> 00:28:25.698
TALIESIN: That makes your agent angry.

00:28:25.698 --> 00:28:29.796
BRIAN: What do you think Baywatch wanted to do
with that 13 year old Taliesin's hair?

00:28:29.796 --> 00:28:38.223
TALIESIN: I was irritated, I had a headache, and I
had to go to an audition for Baywatch for some kid

00:28:38.223 --> 00:28:45.828
who was upset because his grandfather died. The
dialogue was so bad. The dialogue was so bad the

00:28:45.828 --> 00:28:50.334
13 year old boy was going "You don't really expect
me to read this and take this seriously, right?

00:28:50.334 --> 00:28:55.649
This is so stupid. This is weird, a little creepy,
and there's a whole shower thing that I don't--

00:28:55.649 --> 00:29:01.250
Oh god, this is--" I was laughing so much, and
giggling through this serious "Grandpa's dead"

00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:07.095
scene that my dad, trying to be encouraging in his
way, was like, "Well, if you can't take this

00:29:07.095 --> 00:29:13.359
seriously, maybe you shouldn't be doing it." And I
was like, "Oh my god, you're right. I should not

00:29:13.359 --> 00:29:18.855
be put in a room with 11 other kids whose lives
depend on this shit. That's a terrible idea. There

00:29:18.855 --> 00:29:27.070
are people who want this so bad. Call my agent, I
quit, I'm done. I'm going to my room. I'm done."

00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:30.484
BRIAN: I'm grounding myself.

00:29:30.484 --> 00:29:36.532
TALIESIN: I was instantly like, "No more working
out." I was like, "I want to stop working out.

00:29:36.532 --> 00:29:41.722
Being a 13 year old who works out is weird. I want
weird hair, I want to have fun." I found out that

00:29:41.722 --> 00:29:46.884
voice acting means I don't have to work out and I
can have weird hair and keep acting. That was

00:29:46.884 --> 00:29:50.523
literally it. It was like I can have all the fun I
had before, except I don't have to do any of the

00:29:50.523 --> 00:29:56.663
hard shit. That makes it sound so cheap, though.
It wasn't that easy. It wasn't that easy, but

00:29:56.663 --> 00:30:01.600
that's a big part of it. Surrounding yourself with
creative people who are doing good work

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:02.835
does help.

00:30:02.835 --> 00:30:04.896
MARISHA: And, seriously, on-camera shit is
terrifying!

00:30:04.896 --> 00:30:10.280
TALIESIN: Yeah, I still do it every now and then
to remind myself that it's terrifying.

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:14.460
MATT: It's like touching the burner of your stove.
"Oh yeah, that hurts."

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:17.083
BRIAN: "Yeah, Mom was right. That's a no-no."

00:30:17.083 --> 00:30:21.397
TALIESIN: You came in while we had that-- we were
just starting to form this great group of people

00:30:21.397 --> 00:30:26.339
who were constantly-- we don't hang out and watch
movies together, we hang out and make YouTube

00:30:26.339 --> 00:30:34.857
videos. The people in our group are always doing
shit. We don't hang out together, we're like,

00:30:34.857 --> 00:30:38.841
"Hey, do you want to come over and help me produce
this short film that I'm putting into?"

00:30:38.841 --> 00:30:42.000
"Yeah, sure, you need actors? You need a P.A.?
What do you need?"

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.694
BRIAN: Marisha, we're not Vine stars, that's not
what he said.

00:30:44.694 --> 00:30:49.797
MARISHA: No, we're Web Stars. It's different.

00:30:49.797 --> 00:30:53.988
MATT: No. I reject this notion.

00:30:53.988 --> 00:30:56.347
TALIESIN: Those two words don't go together.

00:30:56.347 --> 00:30:58.910
MARISHA: Matt. We're Twitch famous, Matt.

00:30:58.910 --> 00:31:01.034
MATT: (fake sobbing)

00:31:01.034 --> 00:31:04.294
(laughter)

00:31:08.054 --> 00:31:12.289
TALIESIN: I just want to point out, that's like
the cruise ships of the internet, right there.

00:31:12.289 --> 00:31:17.683
MATT: It's just water! Why is it just water?!

00:31:17.683 --> 00:31:21.468
TALIESIN: Because that's all you've earned.

00:31:21.468 --> 00:31:26.183
(laughter)

00:31:31.957 --> 00:31:35.555
HANNAH: All right, let's bring you guys back.
Let's make you inspired and happy again.

00:31:35.555 --> 00:31:38.436
MATT: If it gets bad, just clap loudly towards
us.

00:31:38.436 --> 00:31:42.874
(cheering)

00:31:46.874 --> 00:31:49.564
MATT: You could also get one of those animal
training click things.

00:31:49.564 --> 00:31:51.113
HANNAH: Like a shocker thing?

00:31:51.113 --> 00:31:55.882
MATT: Taser works, that's good. Little extreme,
but functional.

00:31:55.882 --> 00:32:01.433
HANNAH: Okay, so to bring it back up again, let's
talk about what your inspirations are, guys. Let's

00:32:01.433 --> 00:32:06.663
talk about who keeps you going.

00:32:06.663 --> 00:32:10.582
HANNAH and AUDIENCE: Aww.

00:32:14.872 --> 00:32:19.204
BRIAN: Johnny Walker.

00:32:19.204 --> 00:32:20.800
TALIESIN: Jim to his friends.

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:29.117
BRIAN: Yeah. I was saying that for Marisha.

00:32:29.117 --> 00:32:36.299
MATT: I mean, as far as just personal life and
stuff, friends, family. The family we have and the

00:32:36.299 --> 00:32:41.621
family we choose, that makes a really, really big
difference. Especially in our city--

00:32:41.621 --> 00:32:44.522
TALIESIN: The family we have time for, these
days.

00:32:44.522 --> 00:32:49.886
MARISHA: The family we make YouTube videos with.

00:32:49.886 --> 00:32:55.067
MATT: Yeah, those are the biggest points of
inspiration keeping us together and not going

00:32:55.067 --> 00:33:03.794
crazy in this crazy world. Gets crazier every day.
As far as career stuff, what other inspirations do

00:33:03.794 --> 00:33:10.699
you guys pull from? What other people or what
other types of art do you draw from?

00:33:10.699 --> 00:33:16.699
TALIESIN: I have other creative friends,
especially older friends, that are the people I

00:33:16.699 --> 00:33:25.311
would like to grow up to be, which is a horrifying
thing to say in your forties. I said it. It's

00:33:25.311 --> 00:33:30.233
weird, it's the people who are older than me that
have found a place that appears to be comfortable,

00:33:30.233 --> 00:33:35.375
although I'm sure it's not. And then the friends
of mine who are starting out who remind me that I

00:33:35.375 --> 00:33:44.499
have to work hard, because they're going to devour
me alive and take all my jobs. Bless them.

00:33:44.499 --> 00:33:47.060
MARISHA: You're so insightful.

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:51.581
TALIESIN: Eh. It's mostly jetlag.

00:33:51.581 --> 00:33:53.516
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Papa savage?

00:33:53.516 --> 00:33:59.048
MATT: Papa savage. Brian?

00:33:59.048 --> 00:34:06.082
BRIAN: Oh, man. I think on the show one night, I
said, "Surround yourself with people that want to

00:34:06.082 --> 00:34:15.088
leave the world better than you found it." I've
known these guys for a long time. Taliesin's the

00:34:15.088 --> 00:34:25.698
only person I met after the home game started, but
I knew you guys back in the cut. As I've gotten

00:34:25.698 --> 00:34:32.193
older, too-- I'm 34, I'm not old, but as I've
gotten older, I find myself surrounding myself

00:34:32.193 --> 00:34:38.243
with people that are not just motivated, but are
passionate, like I was saying earlier, and people

00:34:38.243 --> 00:34:44.596
that are helping each other. L.A. and New York and
places that are creative, they're also very

00:34:44.596 --> 00:34:55.383
competitive, and even though a lot of these guys
are in the same industry, nobody really competes.

00:34:55.383 --> 00:35:05.322
We seem to celebrate successes and we mourn losses
together, and it's a family that you choose. That

00:35:05.322 --> 00:35:11.999
really inspires me. Plus, I like to read a lot.

00:35:11.999 --> 00:35:17.491
MARISHA: That's a good point, though. It's a
competitive that's there, but inspiring, and

00:35:17.491 --> 00:35:20.643
you're always rooting for the home team.

00:35:20.643 --> 00:35:27.508
BRIAN: Yeah, it's iron sharpening iron. Rather
than walking all over each other or secretly

00:35:27.508 --> 00:35:32.118
going, "Stab that bitch in the back." Like, you
and Laura do behind each others' backs.

00:35:32.118 --> 00:35:34.843
MARISHA: Oh yeah, totally. Well, you know.

00:35:34.843 --> 00:35:37.665
BRIAN: It's where I got that idea from.

00:35:37.665 --> 00:35:44.377
MARISHA: When she dies, I get the other half of
my soul. I don't know what you wanted me to say.

00:35:44.377 --> 00:35:49.004
BRIAN: Who couldn't that be said about?

00:35:49.004 --> 00:35:59.615
MATT: For me, storytelling is very important. On a
basic scale, when you consider both the classic

00:35:59.615 --> 00:36:07.587
tribal elders around the fire telling stories and
myths to the young, we as a people, as a species,

00:36:07.587 --> 00:36:12.370
thrive on being inspired by stories from those
that came before us, and that's been as long as

00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:22.589
we've had speech. As each generation, every epoch
comes by, that transitions into media that we have

00:36:22.589 --> 00:36:27.006
nowadays, storytelling is even more important,
because that's what inspires us to want to create,

00:36:27.006 --> 00:36:31.499
to make the world better, to make ourselves
better, to see a character in a story or a TV

00:36:31.499 --> 00:36:36.606
series or a video game that we aspire to be more
like and make adjustments in our life to try and

00:36:36.606 --> 00:36:43.002
be more like that character, to feel more
fulfilled and ultimately a better person. I found

00:36:43.002 --> 00:36:48.577
a lot of that inspiration through, and it sounds
so hackneyed because of what we're here for

00:36:48.577 --> 00:36:51.985
partially, Dungeons &amp; Dragons and role playing
games were such an inspiration to me because it

00:36:51.985 --> 00:36:58.208
gave me a safe space to discover myself, and a
safe space to step into the shoes of people who

00:36:58.208 --> 00:37:03.933
weren't like me. That I could create or come to
understand different experiences and perspectives.

00:37:03.933 --> 00:37:07.564
Through our show, what we're seeing now is this
resurgence of tabletop gaming. It's one of the few

00:37:07.564 --> 00:37:14.713
forms of media that people can be inspired by and
then turn around the next day and go create

00:37:14.713 --> 00:37:22.293
themselves. That, to me, is incredible. I think
it's amazing. If anything from what our game has

00:37:22.293 --> 00:37:28.754
done, or our stream, show, whatever you want to
call it, our game, is seeing so many of you guys

00:37:28.754 --> 00:37:34.189
go out there and create your own adventures, and
send us pictures of your game groups, and tell us

00:37:34.189 --> 00:37:40.666
stories of the things that your parties have done.
What inspires me to do anything that I do is the

00:37:40.666 --> 00:37:48.591
hope that whatever art I create inspires other
people to create better art in the future.

00:37:48.591 --> 00:37:49.942
MARISHA: Word.

00:37:49.942 --> 00:37:51.479
BRIAN: It does, Matt.

00:37:51.479 --> 00:37:55.182
(applause)

00:37:59.622 --> 00:38:02.858
HANNAH: Do you guys have any good book
suggestions?

00:38:02.858 --> 00:38:08.499
MATT: House of Leaves. It's a really good horror
book. You should read it if you like horror books.

00:38:08.499 --> 00:38:14.656
Read it at night with the lights low. Trust me.

00:38:14.656 --> 00:38:21.156
BRIAN: Oh, book recommendations? City of Thieves
by David Benioff. He's the creator and writer of

00:38:21.156 --> 00:38:26.131
the Game of Thrones TV show. He also wrote a book
called The 25th Hour which is incredible. And he

00:38:26.131 --> 00:38:29.499
wrote a book called When the Nines Roll Over.
Okay, I'm recommending all three of his books.

00:38:29.499 --> 00:38:40.736
Anyway, if you like Game of Thrones, it's nothing
like it, but you'll like it. City of Thieves. It's

00:38:40.736 --> 00:38:49.237
an incredible book. The video game, The Last of Us
was, Neil tells me, 95 percent inspired by that

00:38:49.237 --> 00:38:59.184
book, so it's a really incredible book, so that's
my recommendation. I also wrote a book. That one's

00:38:59.184 --> 00:39:02.755
pretty cheap on Amazon.

00:39:02.755 --> 00:39:05.857
MARISHA: Come on, shameless plug. You
brought it up.

00:39:05.857 --> 00:39:07.251
MATT: What's it called?

00:39:07.251 --> 00:39:14.179
BRIAN: Yeah. I'm a published poet. I've made tens
of dollars as a poet.

00:39:14.179 --> 00:39:15.375
TALIESIN: Damn.

00:39:15.375 --> 00:39:16.634
MARISHA: It's pretty dope.

00:39:16.634 --> 00:39:21.319
BRIAN: My book is called Blackened White, Brian W.
Foster. It's on Amazon. It's a collection of

00:39:21.319 --> 00:39:24.981
essays, short stories. I have another one coming
out next year, because it will be ten years that

00:39:24.981 --> 00:39:30.883
I've been in Los Angeles. And it's called Poisoned
Chalices: Reflections on an Almost Sober Decade

00:39:30.883 --> 00:39:31.890
in LA.

00:39:31.890 --> 00:39:33.637
MARISHA: Next year is your ten years?

00:39:33.637 --> 00:39:36.340
MARISHA and BRIAN: Next year is my ten years.

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:44.116
BRIAN: Should we all leave? Are you supposed to
go?

00:39:44.116 --> 00:39:46.534
TALIESIN: I believe you get a convertible and head
to Vegas.

00:39:46.534 --> 00:39:48.661
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:39:48.661 --> 00:39:51.537
BRIAN: With a suitcase full of drugs in the trunk?

00:39:51.537 --> 00:39:53.401
TALIESIN: It's a suitcase full of games.

00:39:53.401 --> 00:39:59.218
MARISHA: I automatically get my Jeep Wrangler,
right? That just comes with my ten years?

00:39:59.218 --> 00:40:00.968
BRIAN: Plane Shift to Vegas.

00:40:00.968 --> 00:40:02.518
TALIESIN: You can only drive it in sandals.

00:40:02.518 --> 00:40:07.127
MARISHA: I automatically get a medical marijuana
card, just with your ten-year anniversary. Yeah,

00:40:07.127 --> 00:40:10.042
great.

00:40:10.042 --> 00:40:14.348
MATT: It comes with your car registration.
Taliesin, book recommendations?

00:40:14.348 --> 00:40:18.125
TALIESIN: I just cleaned up my bookshelf, so I'm
rereading a bunch of nonfiction that nobody wants

00:40:18.125 --> 00:40:24.648
to read, but the last fiction book, I reread Terry
Southern's Magic Christian, because I was using it

00:40:24.648 --> 00:40:31.634
for something I was writing. Which I love madly,
so, I really like weird 60s pop. I've got a thing

00:40:31.634 --> 00:40:34.157
for it. It's a great book!

00:40:34.157 --> 00:40:36.859
MARISHA: I guess I'm going to go off the fiction
ramp--

00:40:36.859 --> 00:40:38.728
TALIESIN: Please, because mine are awful.

00:40:38.728 --> 00:40:43.090
MARISHA: Since we were talking about creativity
and how to inspire that, I've been reading through

00:40:43.090 --> 00:40:50.324
Creativity Inc. which is written by Ed Catmull,
who was one of the founders of Pixar. He talks

00:40:50.324 --> 00:40:59.001
about harboring a creative environment, and
helping the creative flow in the workspace, it's

00:40:59.001 --> 00:41:02.872
just really good for anyone. It's good!

00:41:02.872 --> 00:41:06.039
BRIAN: What's the takeaway from it so far?

00:41:06.039 --> 00:41:11.906
TALIESIN: Something other than babies and cars.
You give those Patton-style speeches in the office

00:41:11.906 --> 00:41:16.242
every now and then, where you just stand up and
start, "There's a story in this book, you got to

00:41:16.242 --> 00:41:18.893
know." We all just sit and listen for a minute.

00:41:18.893 --> 00:41:22.200
BRIAN: Storytime. Everyone gets on bean bag
chairs.

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:31.205
MARISHA: I think just allowing creativity to flow,
and not extinguishing anyone's creative flame just

00:41:31.205 --> 00:41:39.447
because you think that your job title allows that.
It could be a PA, it could be a writer, it could

00:41:39.447 --> 00:41:46.709
be someone in sales or marketing, and anyone can
have a creative idea, and I think we all have a

00:41:46.709 --> 00:41:51.224
responsibility to listen to those creative
ideas--

00:41:51.224 --> 00:41:53.186
BRIAN: Regardless of where they are in the chain.

00:41:53.186 --> 00:41:58.563
MARISHA: Regardless of where they are in the
chain. Because anyone can have an amazing idea. I

00:41:58.563 --> 00:42:03.842
think a good leader will listen to all of those,
even if they decide to implement them or not.

00:42:03.842 --> 00:42:06.517
BRIAN: Then why have you shot down all my ideas
for other shows?

00:42:06.517 --> 00:42:11.390
MARISHA: Well, your name's Brian Foster. I mean.

00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:16.847
BRIAN: I wanted to have the show where they chase
wheels down the street. Where you chase wheels

00:42:16.847 --> 00:42:18.086
down the street?

00:42:18.086 --> 00:42:21.966
MARISHA: Yeah, well, stop pitching porn and then
maybe we'll talk.

00:42:21.966 --> 00:42:24.361
BRIAN: It's VR, but it's an experimental form
of--

00:42:24.361 --> 00:42:27.990
MARISHA: I know. But we'll talk. Back to the
drawing board.

00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:33.144
MATT: To be fair, we are in the valley. Next
question?

00:42:33.144 --> 00:42:35.055
BRIAN: Please.

00:42:35.055 --> 00:42:39.777
HANNAH: I actually did want to ask, have you guys
ever had a role offered to you that made you feel

00:42:39.777 --> 00:42:44.499
very uncomfortable, that you didn't want to do,
that you had to say no to?

00:42:44.499 --> 00:42:47.748
MATT: Ever had a role that we felt uncomfortable
and said no to?

00:42:47.748 --> 00:42:52.210
TALIESIN: Part of your job as an actor, one of the
first things they teach you, if you're going to be

00:42:52.210 --> 00:42:59.180
an actor, is that your job is to be very
uncomfortable. That's something that doesn't get

00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:04.115
said very often, is there's nothing that will kill
your career faster than being, "I'm not

00:43:04.115 --> 00:43:11.138
comfortable playing that part." And they're like,
"Okay. Thank you." I mean there are places and

00:43:11.138 --> 00:43:18.733
there are things, obviously, but I spent a chunk
of my childhood crying being molested for ABC

00:43:18.733 --> 00:43:21.906
afterschool specials.

00:43:21.906 --> 00:43:26.226
(laughter)

00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:31.850
TALIESIN: Child's Cry, with Peter Coyote,
which you can find on the ABC Afternoon--

00:43:31.850 --> 00:43:39.117
I'm not even kidding. I think it's probably
findable on YouTube, and you can watch a whole

00:43:39.117 --> 00:43:43.451
courtroom scene where I'm crying and bawling,
describing terrible things that a baseball coach

00:43:43.451 --> 00:43:47.801
did, and what you're not seeing, is that every ten
minutes they stop as that lawyer forgets his three

00:43:47.801 --> 00:43:57.153
words of dialogue, while-- I have been sobbing for
45 minutes, fucker, you just have to remember

00:43:57.153 --> 00:44:03.950
"Objection." I'm nine! What is your damage?

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:13.980
While there's the creepiest looking
baseball coach who's just looking at me,

00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:20.501
going, "I'm so sorry, dude, I
don't even know." Like, he's okay!

00:44:20.501 --> 00:44:25.742
MATT: Taliesin? You're my favorite person.

00:44:25.742 --> 00:44:30.586
TALIESIN: I mean obviously, there are things, but
part of your job is to be excited by the notion of

00:44:30.586 --> 00:44:33.695
doing something that's going to make you
vulnerable, as long as it's the right kind of

00:44:33.695 --> 00:44:34.983
vulnerable.

00:44:34.983 --> 00:44:40.531
MATT: Yeah, as a performer, as an actor, if it's a
space that you want to explore because it is

00:44:40.531 --> 00:44:47.443
outside of your comfort zone, and you want to
stretch those muscles, yes. I have had radio spots

00:44:47.443 --> 00:44:54.861
that I read for, and then didn't realize that the
ideologies or the political circumstances behind

00:44:54.861 --> 00:45:01.397
those pieces I was very fervently against, and
then said, "I'm good," and turned those down.

00:45:01.397 --> 00:45:06.858
There was one video game that I read for, or I
didn't read for, I was about to read for. I sent

00:45:06.858 --> 00:45:12.208
the audition. They didn't send the sides, I was
supposed to arrive and get the sides, and it was

00:45:12.208 --> 00:45:18.055
for a motion capture project. The game ended up
being cancelled, thankfully. But I show up to it,

00:45:18.055 --> 00:45:20.622
they give me the sides for the character, I had a
little bit of character background. I start

00:45:20.622 --> 00:45:29.939
reading through the script, and it was just
extremely racist, extremely offensive.

00:45:29.939 --> 00:45:32.359
BRIAN: Yeah, but I told you I was going to do
revisions.

00:45:32.359 --> 00:45:38.023
(laughter)

00:45:38.023 --> 00:45:48.644
TALIESIN: I felt it coming, too. Oh no! It's like
the wave at the Shamu tank, and it's no, no, no.

00:45:48.644 --> 00:45:50.062
Why did I pick the first row?

00:45:50.062 --> 00:45:51.552
BRIAN: I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

00:45:51.552 --> 00:46:00.644
TALIESIN: Goddamn. Dude. I'm so proud of you.

00:46:00.644 --> 00:46:07.222
MATT: I can see what you were going for, Brian. But
I felt the methods of delivering those things were

00:46:08.156 --> 00:46:14.171
a little too ham-fisted, and the point was lost.
So I decided to decline and not go through with

00:46:14.171 --> 00:46:15.416
the audition.

00:46:15.416 --> 00:46:18.938
BRIAN: I get it. I found a new gig, anyway.

00:46:18.938 --> 00:46:24.928
TALIESIN: I guess there are auditions that I just
turned down because I'm like, no, I don't want to.

00:46:24.928 --> 00:46:28.803
If it's not a story I'm really behind, yeah, that
does happen.

00:46:28.803 --> 00:46:33.173
MARISHA: Yeah, there's a difference between
getting a script for the Scientology Center and

00:46:33.173 --> 00:46:35.201
being like, nah, I'm good--

00:46:35.201 --> 00:46:39.709
TALIESIN: I always read the Scientology scripts.

00:46:39.709 --> 00:46:42.366
MARISHA: Versus an acting role.

00:46:42.366 --> 00:46:47.367
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's true. I got my dad on their
mailing list when I was 16.

00:46:47.367 --> 00:46:48.712
BRIAN: That's messed up.

00:46:48.712 --> 00:46:49.883
TALIESIN: I am such a jerk.

00:46:49.883 --> 00:46:51.065
BRIAN: Unless he enjoyed it.

00:46:51.065 --> 00:46:55.118
TALIESIN: No, he did not. He still doesn't. You're
never off.

00:46:55.118 --> 00:47:04.044
BRIAN: I've never lost a role to anyone. But
that's because I've never gotten offered one. I

00:47:04.044 --> 00:47:12.024
did lose one to Elijah Wood, though. Nah, I don't
know what that means. I'm just kidding. I like

00:47:12.024 --> 00:47:18.915
him. I'm not saying, "Fuck that guy." I don't want
that to get out there. I think he's cool. Frodo.

00:47:18.915 --> 00:47:26.764
I mean, he's known for more than just-- Whatever.
I sound like Dan Harmon.

00:47:26.764 --> 00:47:29.210
TALIESIN: You're starting to--

00:47:29.210 --> 00:47:30.213
BRIAN: I'm starting to turn into him.

00:47:30.213 --> 00:47:31.899
MATT: You're spending too much time with him.

00:47:31.899 --> 00:47:38.277
BRIAN: Yeah, I'm turning into a fat, drunk, old
man, all of a sudden.

00:47:38.277 --> 00:47:41.616
MARISHA: Your white, older, drunk male is rubbing
off. It's showing.

00:47:41.616 --> 00:47:48.153
BRIAN: Yeah, I know. That's what it says on my
badge, actually. White, older, drunk male. That's

00:47:48.153 --> 00:47:50.651
it. Right there on the badge.

00:47:50.651 --> 00:47:53.291
TALIESIN: It's my favorite character class.

00:47:53.291 --> 00:47:55.546
BRIAN: Is that in the campaign guide, Matt?

00:47:55.546 --> 00:47:58.432
MATT: You find that on DM's Guild, I think.

00:47:58.432 --> 00:48:02.215
MARISHA: You get advantage on constitution
checks.

00:48:02.215 --> 00:48:09.000
MATT: Disadvantage on wisdom, intelligence and
charisma. Any roles that you've turned down?

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.305
MARISHA: What Taliesin said. Next question.

00:48:11.305 --> 00:48:12.653
TALIESIN: Next question.

00:48:12.653 --> 00:48:17.615
HANNAH: Guys, if you're okay with it, we're going
to do one more question, and then we'll open it up

00:48:17.615 --> 00:48:20.796
for questions. Is that okay for everybody?

00:48:20.796 --> 00:48:24.326
BRIAN: As long as we could be able to see the
person that asks.

00:48:24.326 --> 00:48:27.285
TALIESIN: To be fair, you could have all left, we
can't even see you.

00:48:27.285 --> 00:48:32.665
HANNAH: I will ask that you guys keep it
appropriate, please. We are all adults, I think.

00:48:32.665 --> 00:48:34.258
Maybe. Possibly.

00:48:34.258 --> 00:48:41.399
MARISHA: I thought she was talking to us. A
hundred percent. I was like, oh no.

00:48:41.399 --> 00:48:44.606
(laughter)

00:48:44.606 --> 00:48:46.881
MATT: Says a lot about us.

00:48:46.881 --> 00:48:49.452
BRIAN: By the end of the weekend, she will be.

00:48:49.452 --> 00:48:54.653
MATT: At least we're self-aware. Can't say that
we're not that. All right, what's the final

00:48:54.653 --> 00:48:55.654
question?

00:48:55.654 --> 00:49:00.688
HANNAH: Okay, final question is: Is there any
projects that you guys are working on or hope to

00:49:00.688 --> 00:49:06.716
be working on that you could tell us a little bit
about?

00:49:08.246 --> 00:49:16.153
MARISHA: Actually this one-- A few just came out
that I can announce. I am super over-dramatic and

00:49:16.153 --> 00:49:26.078
ridiculous and insane in the Friday the 13th video
game that's coming out. You can kill me so many

00:49:26.078 --> 00:49:31.337
ways. So many ways to kill me. I am A.J. in that
game.

00:49:31.337 --> 00:49:32.342
TALIESIN: Awesome.

00:49:32.342 --> 00:49:36.705
BRIAN: When does it come out? On Friday the...

00:49:36.705 --> 00:49:44.075
MARISHA: (intentional mumbling) Comes out on
google it. Yeah.

00:49:44.075 --> 00:49:46.423
BRIAN: You think it came out today? Said a
voice--

00:49:46.423 --> 00:49:48.554
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I saw that on one of the store
pages online.

00:49:48.554 --> 00:49:51.380
MARISHA: That actually might be true--

00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:57.294
MATT: Came out on Friday, the 26th. Missed the
ball with that one, guys.

00:49:57.294 --> 00:50:01.998
MARISHA: I did have people tweeting at me how
they're like, "I've saved Marisha two times

00:50:01.998 --> 00:50:07.675
already! I gave her a security blanket and some
hot chocolate." Like legit, that was someone's

00:50:07.675 --> 00:50:09.967
tweet.

00:50:09.967 --> 00:50:13.941
BRIAN: You're like, "Thanks, someone's going to
come along and murder me with an axe."

00:50:13.941 --> 00:50:17.354
MATT: I don't know why, but when you said that I
imagined a wonderful game where you don't play as

00:50:17.354 --> 00:50:22.064
the people being killed in Friday the 13th, you
play as the EMT's that come up after the scene and

00:50:22.064 --> 00:50:23.554
comfort the survivor.

00:50:23.554 --> 00:50:25.162
MARISHA: The true heroes.

00:50:25.162 --> 00:50:27.753
MATT: Press square to slowly rub their back as you
ask them what's wrong.

00:50:27.753 --> 00:50:32.566
BRIAN: Oh my god. I would play that game.

00:50:32.566 --> 00:50:35.226
MARISHA: It's got a dialogue tree.

00:50:35.226 --> 00:50:38.696
MATT: There's a DLC where you can bring like a
help dog to come over.

00:50:38.696 --> 00:50:40.728
MARISHA: A canine unit.

00:50:40.728 --> 00:50:47.061
TALIESIN: Therapy dog. Downloadable content
therapy dog, yeah there we are.

00:50:47.061 --> 00:50:50.747
MATT: That is for free, you can run with it.

00:50:50.747 --> 00:50:59.314
TALIESIN: The big one for me after over a year of
waiting. Injustice 2 finally came out. I get to be

00:50:59.314 --> 00:51:02.455
Barry Allen The Flash! Oh my god! So that's really
cool.

00:51:02.455 --> 00:51:09.576
MARISHA: You and Liam as Reverse Flash in that
scene that came out was like the best thing ever.

00:51:09.576 --> 00:51:13.014
TALIESIN: One of the guys who was actually working
on the animatic, when I was in there. He was like,

00:51:13.014 --> 00:51:20.255
"Do you want to see?" He was delighted, I was
delighted, everyone was delighted. We were giggling

00:51:20.255 --> 00:51:27.832
like 14 year-- (giggling) oh, the windmill!
(giggling)

00:51:27.832 --> 00:51:32.954
MATT: I'm not going to lie. I'm deriving so much
enjoyment from all of the posts in recent weeks

00:51:32.964 --> 00:51:40.419
about everyone complaining Deadshot is so
overpowered in the game. and I'm like (laughter).

00:51:40.419 --> 00:51:43.446
Learn to zone!

00:51:45.051 --> 00:51:47.734
BRIAN: Oh dang.

00:51:53.199 --> 00:52:01.553
MATT: I can't say who I'm playing yet. but I can
say that I'm in the Star Wars Battlefront 2. I'm

00:52:01.553 --> 00:52:09.185
really excited about that, a fun character in that
one. Let's see what else can I talk about. NDAs

00:52:09.185 --> 00:52:15.284
is a problem. We all have like four chips in the
back of our brains from Warner Bros, Blizzard.

00:52:15.284 --> 00:52:21.046
They can press the button any time and we're done.
It's like a remote Battle Royale scenario; it's

00:52:21.046 --> 00:52:26.950
pretty intense-- and if you don't know what Battle
Royale is: watch that movie, it's great. The

00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:35.721
original Japanese one. The perpetual joy that is
Fire Emblem Heroes, which I still play way too

00:52:35.721 --> 00:52:36.716
much.

00:52:36.716 --> 00:52:42.360
MARISHA: You're all welcome for Effie being a
badass. Just putting that out there

00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:50.094
MATT: She's one of the most dangerous arena
characters, with the proper inherent skills.

00:52:50.094 --> 00:52:55.801
TALIESIN: (deep voice) I like that I'm getting to use the
Wolverine voice more and more, it's really nice.

00:52:55.801 --> 00:52:59.314
BRIAN: Oh, that is really nice.

00:52:59.314 --> 00:53:04.598
TALIESIN: (deep voice) It's got a lot of treble; it's good.
(regular voice) I don't know where I'm going with that.

00:53:04.598 --> 00:53:08.497
MARISHA: Brian, you're doing so much cool shit
and you can't say any--

00:53:08.497 --> 00:53:13.315
BRIAN: I can't say shit. I can't say-- I have this
phone right here--

00:53:13.315 --> 00:53:15.180
TALIESIN: You think that we're teasing him but
we're not.

00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:20.611
BRIAN: I have this picture of my lawyer and I just
know that if--

00:53:20.611 --> 00:53:26.427
MARISHA: He's on Facetime right now glaring at
you.

00:53:26.427 --> 00:53:34.075
BRIAN: I'll just say that after I lost my job at
the Two Broke Girls show doing security. By the

00:53:34.075 --> 00:53:44.355
way, I can say this now the show's been cancelled,
neither of those girls were broke. That was a lie.

00:53:44.355 --> 00:53:52.019
I have a new gig but I can't talk about it. I'll
just say I'm stoked, and when it is announced

00:53:52.019 --> 00:53:53.798
you'll probably hear something about it.

00:53:53.798 --> 00:53:55.761
MATT: Yeah, it's really cool.

00:53:55.761 --> 00:54:00.227
MARISHA: (whispering, no audio)

00:54:00.227 --> 00:54:08.266
BRIAN: About the-- Oh yeah, I was a part of that.
So if you guys know Logic the rapper, he's one of

00:54:08.266 --> 00:54:18.519
my best friends and my writing partner. He just
put out an album and I was a part of that process

00:54:18.519 --> 00:54:24.853
a little bit and working on a lot of cool stuff
with him and the next record already. If you guys

00:54:24.853 --> 00:54:30.447
want to check it out it's called Everybody. I had a
shirt on earlier but I took a shower because--

00:54:30.447 --> 00:54:34.410
TALIESIN: And the shirt melted off. Dissolvable
shirt.

00:54:34.410 --> 00:54:43.866
BRIAN: Everyone on the plane-- the plane was like
The Stand. Our journey here, friends, to see you was

00:54:43.866 --> 00:54:46.720
long, but we're glad to be here.

00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:48.754
MARISHA: That's what happens when you fly
American.

00:54:48.754 --> 00:54:56.010
BRIAN: The plane was sticky, the windows were
sticky, the floor was sticky. It was like they had

00:54:56.010 --> 00:55:02.329
just filmed Neighbors 3 inside the cabin of the
airplane.

00:55:02.329 --> 00:55:05.261
TALIESIN: Does it ever occur to you that maybe
it's just that you're really sticky, so everything

00:55:05.261 --> 00:55:09.701
you touch is sticky? I'm not saying it wasn't
sticky; it was a sticky airplane.

00:55:09.701 --> 00:55:19.390
BRIAN: You know how some people are born with
naturally moist hands? What if I just had sticky--

00:55:19.390 --> 00:55:24.148
Like Spiderman, yeah, but isn't there a guy who
has furry, sticky--I don't know why they got to be

00:55:24.148 --> 00:55:26.826
furry, but sticky hands? You all right?

00:55:26.826 --> 00:55:31.934
TALIESIN: Other than my dad, I think you're pretty
good on that.

00:55:31.934 --> 00:55:36.471
HANNAH: Do we want to open it up for questions
now, on that note? I do have notes, guys, before

00:55:36.471 --> 00:55:37.473
we jump into it.

00:55:37.473 --> 00:55:38.838
MATT: Before we jump into it, she has notes.

00:55:38.838 --> 00:55:40.770
TALIESIN: There's going to be a short quiz.

00:55:40.770 --> 00:55:46.756
HANNAH: Can I have everybody hold on one second?
One thing: these guys are lovely, but they cannot

00:55:46.756 --> 00:55:52.906
stay for signings. I encourage you to check your
MomoCon app to see where they're going to be next.

00:55:52.906 --> 00:55:54.627
Follow them around like little birds.

00:55:54.627 --> 00:55:56.012
TALIESIN: We have a few more signings.

00:55:56.012 --> 00:56:01.214
HANNAH: Also, at the end, please stay seated. This
is for your safety, we want to get people out in

00:56:01.214 --> 00:56:05.618
an orderly fashion, not like cavemen. Or women, to
not be sexist.

00:56:05.618 --> 00:56:06.622
TALIESIN: Caveperson.

00:56:06.622 --> 00:56:09.959
HANNAH: So please stay seated.

00:56:09.959 --> 00:56:11.906
ALL: Cavepeople.

00:56:11.906 --> 00:56:16.349
MATT: (high-pitched) It's high noon!
(normal voice) Sorry.

00:56:16.349 --> 00:56:18.857
TALIESIN: I'd play that app.

00:56:18.857 --> 00:56:20.048
MARISHA: Chibi-Overwatch?

00:56:20.048 --> 00:56:24.739
TALIESIN. Chibi-Overwatch. I would totally play
Chibi-Overwatch. Especially if I got loot boxes

00:56:24.739 --> 00:56:25.736
for it.

00:56:25.736 --> 00:56:27.447
MATT: Choverwatch.

00:56:27.447 --> 00:56:30.600
HANNAH: That's all the notes that I have, so let's
do some questions.

00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:32.621
MATT: All right. Oh, there's already--

00:56:32.621 --> 00:56:38.597
MARISHA: Can we bring house lights on a bit?

00:56:38.597 --> 00:56:41.291
HANNAH: So we can see our lovely people.

00:56:41.291 --> 00:56:44.277
MATT: Banish these shadows from the land.

00:56:44.277 --> 00:56:47.423
TALIESIN: Right now I feel like we're facing the
Grand Inquisitors.

00:56:47.423 --> 00:56:48.420
AUDIENCE MEMBER: How to do this?

00:56:48.420 --> 00:56:51.242
MATT: No, we are doomed to a thousand more years
of darkness, guys, I'm sorry.

00:56:51.242 --> 00:56:56.922
MARISHA: I guess we can go ahead and get started,
man in the dark. What's your name?

00:56:56.922 --> 00:56:58.194
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I'm Daniel.

00:56:58.194 --> 00:56:59.520
ALL: Hi Daniel!

00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:00.512
MATT: How's the abyss?

00:57:00.512 --> 00:57:01.655
DANIEL: It's nice.

00:57:01.655 --> 00:57:02.507
MATT: There we go.

00:57:02.507 --> 00:57:05.533
(cheering)

00:57:05.533 --> 00:57:08.323
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Let there be light!

00:57:08.323 --> 00:57:09.604
MARISHA: I see your face now!

00:57:09.604 --> 00:57:16.436
DANIEL: Thank you. My first livestream was the
Crucible fight with Grog. That's probably going to

00:57:16.436 --> 00:57:20.313
be ingrained in my mind forever.

00:57:20.313 --> 00:57:21.435
MATT: Good!

00:57:21.435 --> 00:57:28.869
DANIEL: What are some of your most memorable
moments from the show before the goldfish?

00:57:28.869 --> 00:57:30.395
TALIESIN: Doesn't remember much after.

00:57:30.395 --> 00:57:33.306
MATT: First off, I was really scared about that
fight, because I was like, "Oh great, I'm going to

00:57:33.306 --> 00:57:39.044
have a one-on-one with two bruisers. That's going
to be great for people to watch and play." Because

00:57:39.044 --> 00:57:43.272
it's just two people. The rest of the party's
like, "All right." So I was really happy that

00:57:43.272 --> 00:57:47.194
Travis went with me on the narrative elements of
that, and we turned it into a fun, dynamic

00:57:47.194 --> 00:57:48.187
battle.

00:57:48.187 --> 00:57:50.435
TALIESIN: That was the last time Ryan made
popcorn. That was nice.

00:57:50.435 --> 00:57:51.441
MARISHA: So awesome.

00:57:51.441 --> 00:57:53.978
TALIESIN: It was really good popcorn.

00:57:53.978 --> 00:57:58.083
MATT: Most memorable moments of the show. You guys
go first.

00:57:59.774 --> 00:58:01.554
TALIESIN: God, do I have to pick?

00:58:01.554 --> 00:58:04.368
MARISHA: So many.

00:58:04.368 --> 00:58:05.311
BRIAN: Hells.

00:58:05.311 --> 00:58:10.509
TALIESIN: Hell was great. Almost drowning
underwater was great.

00:58:10.509 --> 00:58:15.380
MARISHA: I was going to say, the kraken fight was
intense.

00:58:15.380 --> 00:58:16.385
BRIAN: Cows.

00:58:16.385 --> 00:58:21.167
TALIESIN: I was sick for that.
MARISHA: Cows! I'll never forget cows.

00:58:21.167 --> 00:58:22.165
TALIESIN: I watched cows.

00:58:22.165 --> 00:58:23.601
BRIAN: Kevdak.

00:58:23.601 --> 00:58:26.433
MATT: I'm so sorry for any of you in the audience
that has not watched the show and right now is

00:58:26.433 --> 00:58:29.152
going, "What the hell are they talking about?"
Cows.

00:58:29.152 --> 00:58:32.740
BRIAN: I'm just going to keep yelling one-word
random shit--Vorugal.

00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:36.715
MARISHA: Kicking K'Varn in the face was pretty
dope.

00:58:36.715 --> 00:58:42.967
TALIESIN: Finally firing that arrow into the orb
was pretty great. That was solid.

00:58:42.967 --> 00:58:48.508
MATT: From a Dungeon Master's standpoint, I
still-- thank you, ten minute sign. There was

00:58:48.508 --> 00:58:55.334
something so weirdly frightening and satisfying
and delightful spending so much time building up

00:58:55.334 --> 00:59:03.271
Emon and Tal'Dorei, and then in one fell swoop,
just destroying the city. Oh man.

00:59:03.271 --> 00:59:06.763
TALIESIN: Like a kid with a cardboard box.

00:59:06.763 --> 00:59:10.555
MATT: I recommend it sometime.

00:59:10.555 --> 00:59:15.724
BRIAN: You recommend someone spending thousands of
hours creating a world and building it up, and

00:59:15.724 --> 00:59:17.022
then destroying it?

00:59:17.022 --> 00:59:18.920
MATT: Isn't that what SimCity is?

00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:21.608
BRIAN: Hell yeah!

00:59:21.608 --> 00:59:22.702
MATT: And isn't it fun?

00:59:22.702 --> 00:59:25.989
BRIAN: Hell yeah! Awesome.

00:59:25.989 --> 00:59:28.899
TALIESIN: Lock them in the pool.

00:59:28.899 --> 00:59:31.002
TALIESIN: We'll try and be quick, because there's
a line.

00:59:31.002 --> 00:59:32.735
BRIAN: Yeah, go ahead. What's your name?

00:59:32.735 --> 00:59:34.328
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hello, I'm Thomas.

00:59:34.328 --> 00:59:36.006
ALL: Hi, Thomas.

00:59:36.006 --> 00:59:44.123
THOMAS: I'm a sound designer and composer for
games, so I understand the taxes, and the sticky

00:59:44.123 --> 00:59:55.068
airplanes, and all that stuff. My question for you
guys is: how do you deal with monotony, when it

00:59:55.068 --> 00:59:57.799
comes up in your professional life, and--

00:59:57.799 --> 01:00:01.527
BRIAN: Monogamy?

01:00:01.527 --> 01:00:10.301
AUDIENCE MEMBER: That too, but monotony. When
things just become really repetitive or routine.

01:00:10.301 --> 01:00:14.813
TALIESIN: Weirdly, I got to say, maybe this is a
function of LA, I don't think I've had a

01:00:14.813 --> 01:00:18.284
repetitive day in 35 years or so?

01:00:18.284 --> 01:00:21.739
MATT: You also live in a very unique plane of
existence, Taliesin.

01:00:21.739 --> 01:00:27.754
BRIAN: Yeah, Taliesin, you sleep in a different
coffin every night, what are you talking about?

01:00:27.754 --> 01:00:30.653
TALIESIN: There's a curse, and there's some things
I have to do--

01:00:30.653 --> 01:00:33.025
BRIAN: I know, I've seen the clipboard.

01:00:33.025 --> 01:00:35.507
TALIESIN: God.

01:00:35.507 --> 01:00:42.618
MATT: For me? Change of scenery. Self care is a
very important thing in any creative field because

01:00:42.618 --> 01:00:48.612
it can be a very soul-crushing experience at
times, and the monotony in any job can become a

01:00:48.612 --> 01:00:55.016
very difficult thing to maintain, so you owe it to
yourself, when you feel that drudgery take over a

01:00:55.016 --> 01:01:02.533
bit, to walk away and force yourself to go to a
space that's unfamiliar, a space that is different

01:01:02.533 --> 01:01:06.144
and forces you out of your comfort zone, and you
have to adjust. Partially, because it shakes your

01:01:06.144 --> 01:01:14.007
system a bit, but you might end up discovering a
location or people or an environment that you

01:01:14.007 --> 01:01:18.281
never thought you'd enjoy before, and it might
unlock some interesting passions and reinvigorate

01:01:18.281 --> 01:01:23.009
aspects of your life that you didn't consider
until that moment. It's amazing what a change of

01:01:23.009 --> 01:01:26.617
scenery can do, even if it's just taking a walk if
you have writer's block, or something along those

01:01:26.617 --> 01:01:34.233
lines, just getting yourself out of that stagnant
space that you found yourself in, and run in a

01:01:34.233 --> 01:01:36.131
different direction for a while.

01:01:36.131 --> 01:01:41.988
TALIESIN: Just to quickly add to that: there is
information in the ether that surrounds us,

01:01:41.988 --> 01:01:55.070
there's this notion that life is designed in its
very DNA to be toil, and the notion of any kind of

01:01:55.070 --> 01:02:01.077
delight or pleasure is a strange aberration from
the toil that life is supposed to be. I assure you

01:02:01.077 --> 01:02:07.512
this is not true! You are currently at a
convention full of people enjoying themselves, and

01:02:07.512 --> 01:02:13.703
this is an important and necessary thing you're
supposed to do every day in some way. Toil is

01:02:13.703 --> 01:02:20.840
almost the weird one, really know that you'll do
better work if you're happy and enjoying yourself,

01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:23.596
any way you can.

01:02:23.596 --> 01:02:29.493
BRIAN: Yeah, and I would say fresh eyes, fresh
ears, if you write, give it to somebody to read

01:02:29.493 --> 01:02:35.297
that doesn't normally read the kind of stuff you
write. If you make music, get fresh ears and fresh

01:02:35.297 --> 01:02:42.345
eyes on whatever you create, maybe somebody that
wouldn't normally listen to it. It's good to get

01:02:42.345 --> 01:02:47.453
an outside perspective on something. I think that
helps me, creatively.

01:02:47.453 --> 01:02:48.500
TALIESIN: Sound design is nuts, too.

01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:50.470
BRIAN: Yeah, sound especially.

01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:53.874
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We might be giving you guys a
call at some point.

01:02:53.874 --> 01:02:54.874
MATT: All righty!

01:02:54.874 --> 01:02:58.978
BRIAN: As long as you're not with law enforcement,
you're more than welcome to.

01:02:58.978 --> 01:03:01.772
MATT: Is it a subpoena?

01:03:01.772 --> 01:03:02.765
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes.

01:03:02.765 --> 01:03:06.416
MATT: Oh god. I know who you are, now! Thank you
very much!

01:03:06.416 --> 01:03:09.178
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah, of course!

01:03:09.178 --> 01:03:10.488
MATT: Hey, what's your name?

01:03:10.488 --> 01:03:12.821
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Be pleased.

01:03:12.821 --> 01:03:13.815
MARISHA: Beep beep.

01:03:13.815 --> 01:03:14.821
MATT: Bidet.

01:03:14.821 --> 01:03:19.069
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I was at the Charlet Chung panel,
and she touched on this bit where directors would

01:03:19.069 --> 01:03:25.923
give really weird descriptions of the kind of
sound they were trying to get. What's one moment

01:03:25.923 --> 01:03:27.674
that sticks out for you?

01:03:27.674 --> 01:03:30.210
MATT: Of strange script directions and sound
effects?

01:03:30.210 --> 01:03:31.223
AUDIENCE MEMBER: If you want
to give an example--

01:03:31.223 --> 01:03:34.702
MARISHA: One was with Taliesin as the director.

01:03:34.702 --> 01:03:35.698
TALIESIN: I do that a lot.

01:03:35.698 --> 01:03:40.285
MARISHA: With me, that I reference all the time.
That was Akiba's Trip.

01:03:40.285 --> 01:03:41.841
TALIESIN: Which piece of direction?

01:03:41.841 --> 01:03:54.393
MARISHA: It was, "I need you to attack like a cat
person, like a... half-cat, half-person."

01:03:54.393 --> 01:03:55.386
TALIESIN: Sounds like me.

01:03:55.386 --> 01:04:01.282
MARISHA: "And I need you to be incensed that as
you're attacking, your clothes are being ripped

01:04:01.282 --> 01:04:02.575
off."

01:04:02.575 --> 01:04:04.288
TALIESIN: That sounds like me--
MATT: Because Japan.

01:04:04.288 --> 01:04:07.454
MARISHA: Because Japan. And so, I was like--

01:04:07.454 --> 01:04:09.086
TALIESIN: Did I say "Because Japan"?

01:04:09.086 --> 01:04:12.234
MARISHA: I think "Because Japan" got dropped a few
times.

01:04:12.234 --> 01:04:15.778
TALIESIN: Yeah. If I recall, that was definitely
said several times during that game.

01:04:15.778 --> 01:04:22.252
MARISHA: And it turned into a: (screeching cat
noise). I don't know. It was weird.

01:04:22.252 --> 01:04:24.031
TALIESIN: You did pretty good, if I recall.

01:04:24.031 --> 01:04:25.030
MARISHA: It was all right. It was fine.

01:04:25.030 --> 01:04:26.235
TALIESIN: That was a good one.

01:04:26.235 --> 01:04:30.039
MARISHA and BRIAN: It was fine.

01:04:30.039 --> 01:04:34.649
MATT: A lot of scripts get weird, interesting
sound effect noises. Things I love, are when the

01:04:34.649 --> 01:04:39.298
scripts give-- you have, especially if it's in a
long row, you have the line of dialogue, and next

01:04:39.298 --> 01:04:44.858
to it you have the direction that the writer has
for the certain feel of the line. I love the ones

01:04:44.858 --> 01:04:50.718
that are so, "Why did you write that down?" Where
the line is: "Thank you." And the descriptor is:

01:04:50.718 --> 01:05:00.501
"Like, thank you." And you're like:
Oh! Man! Thank you!

01:05:00.501 --> 01:05:05.953
BRIAN: Whoever put that in there, Sam always
Instagrams really funny ones, because he does a

01:05:05.953 --> 01:05:15.251
lot of voice directing, and it'll say, "Person is
on fire," and it says: "Person acting on fire."

01:05:15.251 --> 01:05:21.435
Gotcha. I think "Person on fire" is enough. Why do
they always add the thing? You guys aren't dumb. I

01:05:21.435 --> 01:05:25.486
think you guys could look at that and go, "Oh,
they need a person on fire."

01:05:25.486 --> 01:05:34.462
MARISHA: One of my favorite ones, I think it was
for the old Star Wars Battlefront, and it was this

01:05:34.462 --> 01:05:38.704
line where you're yelling, yelling, yelling, and
then I got to a certain point and it was like:

01:05:38.704 --> 01:05:47.222
"Just... more yelling." I remember taking a picture
of that one. This is my job right now: more

01:05:47.222 --> 01:05:48.217
yelling.

01:05:48.217 --> 01:05:49.805
TALIESIN: We'll text each other if they're really
good.

01:05:49.805 --> 01:05:50.969
MARISHA: Yeah, if they're really good.

01:05:50.969 --> 01:05:54.654
MATT: If you're lucky enough, I've been in a
couple of shows where I've known the writers, or

01:05:54.654 --> 01:05:58.229
friends with the writers on it, and so they'll
leave things in the script for you every now and

01:05:58.229 --> 01:06:05.933
then: "I'm so sorry for this." Like apologizing
for certain lines of dialogue, or they'll write

01:06:05.933 --> 01:06:09.517
lines in the scripts just to mess you up, and then
they'll be like, "All right, no, the real line is

01:06:09.517 --> 01:06:11.421
actually down here."

01:06:11.421 --> 01:06:12.419
BRIAN: That's messed up.

01:06:12.419 --> 01:06:17.867
MATT: I've had a couple times where I'd get to a
line and be like, "Really?!"

01:06:17.867 --> 01:06:19.495
BRIAN: Every word starts with P?

01:06:19.495 --> 01:06:23.638
MATT: Yeah. "How do I--" Then the director's in on
it, they're like, "Yeah, if we can get a few takes

01:06:23.638 --> 01:06:31.052
on that," and I'm like, "Okay. All right. (sigh)"
And then deliver this ridiculous line that makes

01:06:31.052 --> 01:06:32.115
no sense in context--

01:06:32.115 --> 01:06:36.239
BRIAN: "I liked Paula Abdul's first three albums,
but the last three felt--"

01:06:36.239 --> 01:06:40.275
MATT: Stuff like that! And then, like: "All
right, cool, we got that on tape, I'll go ahead

01:06:40.275 --> 01:06:43.148
and send that over to Michelle.
Now we'll get you the actual line

01:06:43.148 --> 01:06:47.492
of dialogue." I'm like: (angry noise) "You!"

01:06:47.492 --> 01:06:48.494
BRIAN: That's messed up.

01:06:48.494 --> 01:06:52.870
MATT: Thank you, that's a good question. We should
go faster. Let's go faster, must go faster.

01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:55.898
MARISHA. Hey. Oh, hi.
HANNAH: We have about two minutes left.

01:06:55.898 --> 01:07:00.215
AUDIENCE MEMBER: My question is for Marisha and
Taliesin. What was the most defining moment in

01:07:00.215 --> 01:07:07.430
your character, for either Keyleth or Percy, for a
turning point? What moment is the most important

01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:09.212
to that character?

01:07:09.212 --> 01:07:10.208
MATT: Lightning round!

01:07:10.208 --> 01:07:14.789
MARISHA: I think about Patrick Rothfuss and
talking her down out of a panic attack quite a

01:07:14.789 --> 01:07:20.287
lot, because the rest of Vox Machina was too
distracted and too in the moment and he was an

01:07:20.287 --> 01:07:26.488
outside force that was like, "Yeah, let's relate
for a second. Let's go outside and relate.

01:07:26.488 --> 01:07:29.150
Hey girl, you want to go relate?"

01:07:29.150 --> 01:07:30.474
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Sure.

01:07:30.474 --> 01:07:32.472
MATT and MARISHA: Go relate and chill.

01:07:32.472 --> 01:07:36.141
TALIESIN: Ripley and Orthax in the dungeon was the
moment where I'm like, okay, I finally figured him

01:07:36.141 --> 01:07:43.208
out. When he was finally having that "What is
happening to me? What is my life? Hold on!" That

01:07:43.208 --> 01:07:45.982
was his moment of actually getting some clarity.

01:07:45.982 --> 01:07:47.270
MATT: Cool.

01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:50.577
ALL: Great question. Great costume!

01:07:50.577 --> 01:07:53.207
MARISHA: Clank clank clank.

01:07:53.207 --> 01:07:54.461
AUDIENCE MEMBER: True disadvantage
on stealth rolls!

01:07:54.461 --> 01:07:58.474
MARISHA: True disadvantage, yep. Now you know why.

01:07:58.474 --> 01:08:03.945
AUDIENCE MEMBER: This is my friend Lindsey, it's
her first con, and she's going to ask the next

01:08:03.945 --> 01:08:05.447
question!

01:08:05.447 --> 01:08:06.786
MATT: Hi Lindsey!

01:08:06.786 --> 01:08:10.392
LINDSEY: Obviously there are plenty of classes to
be taking that are helpful for voice acting and

01:08:10.392 --> 01:08:14.795
writing. For you guys, what has been the most
beneficial class that you've taken?

01:08:14.795 --> 01:08:16.642
MARISHA: Improv.

01:08:16.642 --> 01:08:20.519
MATT: Improv has been huge. Improv and cold
reading.

01:08:20.519 --> 01:08:26.629
TALIESIN: Cold reading classes. There's some
classical theater. I liked learning history of

01:08:26.629 --> 01:08:27.982
theater. It was very useful.

01:08:27.982 --> 01:08:33.572
MARISHA: The hardest part is picking a few things
and committing 100 percent in those cold reading

01:08:33.572 --> 01:08:37.756
auditions, and even if it sucks, at least the
director knows you can commit.

01:08:37.756 --> 01:08:39.075
MATT: Yeah, make a choice and stick to it.

01:08:39.075 --> 01:08:43.914
MARISHA: Make a choice. Making a choice is
massive. And then the director will say "New

01:08:43.914 --> 01:08:51.405
choice" and you go, "No, I'm Faye Dunaway!" and
then you go, and then that's a new choice.

01:08:51.405 --> 01:08:53.623
MATT, BRIAN, and MARISHA: Always Faye Dunaway.

01:08:53.623 --> 01:08:56.204
MARISHA: Never go full Faye Dunaway.

01:08:56.204 --> 01:08:58.057
TALIESIN: Not even Faye Dunaway goes full
Faye Dunaway.

01:08:58.057 --> 01:08:59.057
BRIAN: No, she knows better.

01:08:59.057 --> 01:09:06.062
MARISHA: But that tells them that you're malleable
and can be directed, and can make a strong choice,

01:09:06.062 --> 01:09:08.269
even if it sucks.

01:09:08.269 --> 01:09:10.518
MATT: Awesome. Thank you, good question!

01:09:10.518 --> 01:09:14.848
BRIAN: If you're a writer, just Google David Milch
and watch any video where he's talking, because

01:09:14.848 --> 01:09:18.235
he's a genius. That's not a joke.

01:09:18.235 --> 01:09:21.323
HANNAH: Guys, I'm so sorry, that was our last
one.

01:09:21.323 --> 01:09:23.578
ALL: (gasps) Wait wait, one last one!

01:09:23.578 --> 01:09:28.706
BRIAN: Our panel tomorrow is going to be an hour
Q&amp;A, so you can always ask questions tomorrow.

01:09:28.706 --> 01:09:33.718
AUDIENCE MEMBER: This is inspired by Matt, because
earlier you mentioned Marisha. You mentioned she

01:09:33.718 --> 01:09:39.277
was shut down because "A woman can't do this" or
whatever. This is probably a good general

01:09:39.277 --> 01:09:45.781
persevering question. I'm a woman about to go into
a tech industry, which is a male-dominated field.

01:09:45.781 --> 01:09:55.879
Marisha, what do you do to pep talk yourself,
essentially, during those times? It's probably,

01:09:55.879 --> 01:09:57.484
like I said, a general thing.

01:09:57.484 --> 01:09:59.393
TALIESIN: That's a good one.
MARISHA: It's very layered.

01:09:59.393 --> 01:10:01.216
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I know, I'm sorry,
it's a bad last question.

01:10:01.216 --> 01:10:02.254
MARISHA: No, it's good.

01:10:02.254 --> 01:10:03.254
MATT: It's a good question, though.

01:10:03.254 --> 01:10:10.229
MARISHA: Great question. First and foremost, I
always try and speak to our boys, our guys in the

01:10:10.229 --> 01:10:18.209
audience, and say you also have a responsibility
here. Feminism is not a female-exclusive problem.

01:10:18.209 --> 01:10:29.586
This is a team issue. Everyone has a
responsibility here. I do a lot of stuff, super

01:10:29.586 --> 01:10:39.012
subconsciously. If I have a big meeting, I'll wear
a button-down shirt and slacks and boots. What I

01:10:39.012 --> 01:10:48.823
try and keep in the back of my mind is that I'm
not the first and I won't be the last, and there

01:10:48.823 --> 01:10:58.348
<i>are</i> more allies than enemies. Find your allies.
They will be your guiding force and your strength

01:10:58.348 --> 01:11:04.523
behind you, but to definitely persevere.
You got this, girl. You good.

01:11:04.523 --> 01:11:06.198
BRIAN: Don't take no for an answer,
like she said.

01:11:06.198 --> 01:11:07.895
MARISHA: Don't take no for an answer.

01:11:07.895 --> 01:11:10.468
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Love you guys.
MARISHA: Do <i>not</i> take no for an answer.

01:11:10.468 --> 01:11:13.820
MATT: Thank you guys. I'm so sorry for the people
who we couldn't get to your questions. We have

01:11:13.820 --> 01:11:17.490
other panels this weekend, so if you didn't get
your question answered, bring it to the next

01:11:17.490 --> 01:11:20.018
panel, we'll try and get to it then.

01:11:20.018 --> 01:11:25.516
