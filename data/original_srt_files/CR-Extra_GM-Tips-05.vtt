NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
MATT: Hello everyone! My name is Matthew Mercer, I
am a voice actor and a dungeon master for Geek &amp;

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.973
Sundry's Critical Role, and welcome to my video
series on tips and tricks for game masters and

00:00:08.973 --> 00:00:13.492
dungeon masters alike. Today, we're talking about
the divisive rule of cool.

00:00:13.492 --> 00:00:16.553
[trumpet fanfare]

00:00:16.553 --> 00:00:21.411
For those of you who aren't aware what the rule of
cool is, it's a trope that essentially means a

00:00:21.411 --> 00:00:27.551
willing suspension of disbelief for the sake of a
cool moment. It happens all the time in film and

00:00:27.551 --> 00:00:32.342
television and a lot of storytelling of a visual
nature. It's just being able to suspend your

00:00:32.342 --> 00:00:37.572
disbelief enough to let something cool happen and
not dwell too much on the specifics of it. In RPGs

00:00:37.572 --> 00:00:42.632
this generally refers to occasionally allowing the
chance for some ridiculous stunts or unique

00:00:42.632 --> 00:00:47.474
interpretations of some of the rules or features
of a system for possibly a cool moment.

00:00:48.325 --> 00:00:54.993
I think it's a really really fun element to use in
moderation. You need to establish early on in your

00:00:54.993 --> 00:01:00.164
game with your players how much of a level of
crazy you're willing to allow, just so everyone

00:01:00.164 --> 00:01:05.173
understands the general feel or flow of the story,
what to try for, and what not to try for. A lot of

00:01:05.173 --> 00:01:11.795
non-fantasy RPGS, a lot of modern systems, and low
power horror systems tend to adhere to strict

00:01:11.795 --> 00:01:15.115
realism in player actions because that's how they
build their tension and that's how a lot of the

00:01:15.115 --> 00:01:20.684
game's danger elements are built around. For those
the rule of cool is a little more sparing

00:01:20.684 --> 00:01:25.126
comparatively. And it's not always good for a
game's story to incorporate a lot of-- tension,

00:01:25.126 --> 00:01:30.116
difficulty and fear are a powerful storytelling
tool. And if the player feel like they can do any

00:01:30.116 --> 00:01:37.186
wacky thing, any <i>crazy</i> idea at any given time and
probably be okay, then it takes away an element of

00:01:37.186 --> 00:01:42.756
that. So you want to be sparing with its use, but you
also don't want to squash the player's creativity.

00:01:42.756 --> 00:01:45.177
At least not physically.

00:01:47.028 --> 00:01:51.486
So for the GM and the player, if you agree to
that, that's something that you can occasionally

00:01:51.486 --> 00:01:58.388
pull into a game. Be sparing with it. Pick the
right moments to have those heroic stand up

00:01:58.388 --> 00:02:04.157
experiences to do something crazy. There is a need
for the GM to maintain an internal consistency with

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:09.538
the rules in the world so it stays cohesive and
that people understand the boundaries. You don't

00:02:09.538 --> 00:02:14.403
want the stakes and the reality and the tension to
have less weight, which can happen if you allow

00:02:14.403 --> 00:02:16.446
too many of these to happen in succession.

00:02:16.446 --> 00:02:21.925
Gauge which player actions are viable, as a GM,
and which you might consider abuse. A cool rule of

00:02:21.925 --> 00:02:30.345
cool moment might be like if somebody decided--
for instance, a sorcerer has a fog spell. Cool,

00:02:30.345 --> 00:02:33.518
that's a fog spell. It usually just clouds a
little area. What if they decided they wanted to

00:02:33.518 --> 00:02:39.376
use that fog spell to create enough moisture that
if they funneled it into an area that was

00:02:39.376 --> 00:02:42.476
extremely flammable it would actually dampen the
flames. That's a creative use of it. It's not

00:02:42.476 --> 00:02:47.687
really a rule of cool moment. It's a creative use.
So you can find that separation there.

00:02:47.687 --> 00:02:55.146
If somebody decided they had an ability that let
them slow fall, like a monk in 3.5, they decided

00:02:55.146 --> 00:03:00.016
they wanted to use that to coast down the entire
side of a castle as it was crumbling. That's kind

00:03:00.016 --> 00:03:04.547
of intense, but it's not completely out of the
realm of possibility. So from a cinematic

00:03:04.547 --> 00:03:08.359
standpoint, it could be a really cool character moment
if they're like carrying a special item they just

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:13.158
stole and it's their only way of escape. I would
say go ahead and allow it, possibly incorporating

00:03:13.158 --> 00:03:17.732
some skill checks and some challenge, some
difficulty to that experience. But even if the

00:03:17.732 --> 00:03:22.430
rules don't implicitly say that a person could in
theory continue to coast that down a series of

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.590
long surfaces in a row, don't be afraid to bend
the rules or loosen up a little bit to let those

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.739
cool character moments shine through.

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:36.680
This also involves in battles and terrain, having
to escape on a collapsing ice bridge.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.090
It sounds very cinematic and very Michael Bay film
aspect, and that can be a really cool moment in a

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.780
story, occasionally. But if every single moment in
the game is that, once again it loses its weight,

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.210
loses its cohesiveness, and the quieter moments
seem boring by comparison and players seem less

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:59.611
invested in the story and tension in-between. But
also for people that do not abuse the rule of cool

00:03:59.611 --> 00:04:03.231
and try and constantly break your game,
or go far beyond what their character's

00:04:03.231 --> 00:04:08.761
limitations are, reward those moments of
creativity. You can give them either bonus

00:04:08.761 --> 00:04:13.220
experience at the end of the session, possibly
that moment might lead to a better relationship

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:21.860
with a non-player character, or the discovery of a
secret piece of equipment. But also dissuade

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:26.462
people from reaching too far too often. If someone
continues to reach too far in your game and is

00:04:26.462 --> 00:04:33.240
constantly trying to break what is considered a
viable character feature list or skill set, then

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:39.141
perhaps their failures grow more punishing. There
are ways of doing it that aren't too direct. And

00:04:39.141 --> 00:04:42.151
if you're having a problem enough in the game with
this or you feel that it's really pulling away

00:04:42.151 --> 00:04:45.550
from the overall narrative, or the rest of the
players' experiences, just talk with them outside

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.341
of the game.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:57.512
Now, most RPGs are designed forge a heroic story,
showing feats of legend. So let the players <i>try</i>.

00:04:57.512 --> 00:05:02.400
Let them fail, and occasionally succeed.
Occasionally. One of my favorite phrases, and you

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.251
see me use it constantly in Critical Role, is
"you can certainly try." And I'll stick and adhere

00:05:07.251 --> 00:05:13.070
to that because I think part of what's fun about
RPGs is it's a place where you can attempt things

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.920
you would not otherwise be able to do in your own
life. And as long as you do it in a creative and

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:22.490
respectful way that doesn't damage or disrespect
the time and energy that the dungeon master or

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:27.081
game master has put into the narrative, I think it
can lead to some really, really awesome, memorable

00:05:27.081 --> 00:05:31.990
in-character moments. Just through experience, you
find that fine line. You find what works, what

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.631
doesn't, and make sure you discuss that and are
clear with it with your players going forward, and

00:05:36.631 --> 00:05:41.052
you guys are bound to create some really, really
epic, memorable adventures.

00:05:41.052 --> 00:05:44.349
Thank you so much for watching. I hope this has
been at least somewhat helpful in your game

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:48.951
mastering experiences. You'll be able to see more
of these videos on geekandsundry.com and I'll see

00:05:48.951 --> 00:05:50.373
you next time.
