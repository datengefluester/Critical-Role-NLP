NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.968 line:1
MATT: Hello! My name is Matthew Mercer. I’m a
voice actor and the dungeon master for Geek &amp;

00:00:03.968 --> 00:00:08.579 line:1
Sundry’s Critical Role, and welcome to my fun
little video series on tips and tricks for game

00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:13.498
masters and dungeon masters alike. Today, we’re
going to be discussing player rewards (sinister

00:00:13.498 --> 00:00:16.415
chuckle). That’s right, players. We’re talking
about you, and what makes you happy.

00:00:16.415 --> 00:00:19.703
[trumpet fanfare]

00:00:19.703 --> 00:00:23.853
First and foremost, money’s always good! Giving
away money in the game as general currency is a

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:29.337
helpful way to reward players for finding cool
little hidden alcoves, for defeating powerful

00:00:29.337 --> 00:00:34.120
enemies, for completing story arcs. Gold is that
kind of open currency in role playing games, or

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:40.410 line:1
credits and other forms of currency in sci-fi and
modern games. It’s always a good go to, but you

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.839 line:1
want to consider the current player level and what
their financial situation is, and then provide

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:49.349 line:1
rewards accordingly. If the players have come into
a heck ton of money through just sheer luck or if

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:53.830
they’ve earned it, then maybe start considering
other alternative rewards that aren’t directly

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.409
monetarily just building onto that giant treasure
hoard that they’ve been building.

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:01.320
Keep it interesting. Also keep in mind not all
enemies drop gold. There’s nothing weirder than

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.649
killing a bugbear and it coughs up 56 gold pieces.

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:07.187
You wonder: first off, where it hid it, and two,
how’d you find it?

00:01:07.187 --> 00:01:11.590 line:1
Consider that some of these creatures or things
that wouldn’t carry money on them may have

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.821 line:1
spirited away from the corpses of things they’ve
killed and brought them to hidden alcoves or nests

00:01:17.821 --> 00:01:22.281
or burrows where they live. You’ll find it
under all the sticks and refuse in that area. You

00:01:22.281 --> 00:01:27.240
might find some pretty cool items or sacks of
money that was left behind by these unfortunate

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.330
souls that crossed this creature’s path in the
past. There’s also private collections that bad

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:39.790
guys may have in their abode, or crooked merchants
may keep a secret cache of hidden artifacts. There

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.069
are cool ways to find loot after a battle aside
from just finding it in their pockets immediately

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:48.038
on them. That’s what we’re used to in video games,
but it doesn’t have to be that way.

00:01:50.586 --> 00:01:54.032
Another cool way to reward your players and a
consistent way to do it: equipment upgrades!

00:01:54.032 --> 00:02:00.702 line:1
Whether that be cool futuristic sniper rifles, or
a magical flaming shortsword, most systems have a

00:02:00.702 --> 00:02:05.770 line:1
really good way to track player advancement and
corresponding equipment power levels. Usually

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.109 line:1
these are in the game master’s guides or those
sections of the systems, but they’ll have some

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:13.558
good suggestions as to when and how often you
should dole out these type of equipment-based

00:02:13.558 --> 00:02:18.029 line:1
rewards. Make sure you don’t want to dole it out
too often, because one, they lose their impact and

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:20.821 line:1
their cool factor when the players do find them
and all of a sudden it’s like, “Oh look, another

00:02:20.821 --> 00:02:25.019
magical shield.” They just throw it over their
shoulder. They become less appreciative of these

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:30.142 line:1
cool rewards, and it kind of unbalances the game.
Which, if this does happen, especially if you’re

00:02:30.142 --> 00:02:35.057 line:1
new to the GMing system and after a while you
realize, “Oh, the players are really well decked

00:02:35.057 --> 00:02:39.270 line:1
out in powerful stuff and they’re killing everything I
throw at them that should be a fair challenge.”

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.720
You’re in control of that spigot. Make it tight,
slower trickle. Give out different things for a

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.539
while and let it balance itself out.
Totally doable.

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:52.239 line:1
Also don’t be afraid to customize and create
equipment and items if you can’t find something in

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:57.090 line:1
the books, or the Dungeon Master Guide, or any of
the treasure hoard supplements you out find out

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.393
there that fit what you want to give the players.
Feel free to create stuff. They can be tailored to

00:03:02.393 --> 00:03:07.750
players, or tailored to in-game events, and if you
are worried about it not being balanced or being

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.479
too powerful or too weak, there’s a whole
wonderful thing called the internet. There are

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:16.931
wonderful tabletop RPG communities that are more
than willing to give you feedback on items before

00:03:16.931 --> 00:03:20.558
you dole it out to a player. You can go on forums,
go on Reddit and be like, “Hey guys! Does this

00:03:20.558 --> 00:03:23.958
seem cool?” and they might be like (angry), “No!
That’s too powerful!” or “No, that’s bullshit!” in

00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:27.809
which case, you just go ahead and tweak it.
Criticism can be harsh on occasion but they’re all

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:30.100
there to help, they’re all there to help each
other make a better experience.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.897
Don’t be afraid to ask the internet
for some balancing help.

00:03:36.917 --> 00:03:41.491
There are also alternative rewards you can give
out, outside of both money and items. You can give

00:03:41.491 --> 00:03:45.281
bonus experience points if someone does something
really cool in a game, or completes a really major

00:03:45.281 --> 00:03:49.290
story arc. Just give them a little bump of XP to
get them to that next level a little faster.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:55.131 line:1
There’s also jewels and rare art pieces or
contraband that can be found, that can be traded

00:03:55.131 --> 00:03:59.439 line:1
or sold in other aspects of the world if you have
the right connections in that society. Which is

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:03.261
cool if you have the opportunity and the time, you
can create actual small props when you give these

00:04:03.261 --> 00:04:07.030
out. You can find plastic jewels pretty cheap
online if you wanted to give someone a few actual

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.359
gems at the table. If someone wanted to find a
rare art piece, you can actually get like a really

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:15.789
cheap picture frame and pass it over. It’s cool to
create small props when you’re giving out some of

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:20.829
these rewards that might correspond to it as well.
It elevates the experience for the players at the table.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:25.919 line:1
Some rewards could be alliances. If you end up
doing something really cool in a city or within a

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:32.679 line:1
society, you might through that experience gain
new allies. That can lead to access to new

00:04:32.679 --> 00:04:37.221
merchants, and the ability to purchase things you
couldn’t previously have access to, having

00:04:37.221 --> 00:04:42.260
discounts on those commerce, finding rare
equipment that now, as opposed to being found, can

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:48.552 line:1
be purchased and now readily at your access. Other
cool things, especially if they are dealing with

00:04:48.552 --> 00:04:55.289 line:1
RPGs that have gods or magic power that is beyond
the mortal realm, you can be granted boons. These

00:04:55.289 --> 00:05:00.130
boons can be like, if you do something really good
for a good deity and help defeat evil in a land

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.773
and cleanse it of some curse, the deity that looks
over that realm might come down and be like, “You.

00:05:04.773 --> 00:05:10.660
"You are my chosen champion. For this good gift, I
grant you...” and they touch that player, and all

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.930
of a sudden they are given a permanent plus one to
their constitution. That’s a reward you can

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.652
totally do and it kind of fits into the theme, and
it’s a pretty awesome ability. It could be even

00:05:19.652 --> 00:05:24.421
temporary boons, like for the next month or so you
have additional resistance against this type of

00:05:24.421 --> 00:05:28.953
damage. They can be permanent or temporary
boons, but they also work as good story rewards.

00:05:28.953 --> 00:05:34.658
Also, transportation! If you do a cool story, you
might get a new mount, or you might manage to

00:05:34.658 --> 00:05:39.200
commandeer or be granted a great spaceship that
can travel twice as fast across the galaxy, or is

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:46.130
able to warp to previously inaccessible portions
of that galaxy. Even just faster transport to get

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:51.460 line:1
you from point A to point B a lot quicker. Those
make for great rewards and there’s overall the

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:58.139 line:1
progression reward. Which is the access to
previously inaccessible areas on your map. That

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:03.350
involves getting access to or paperwork that
allows you to bypass a barrier that previously you

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:07.684
could not. There was a landscape that was
previously at war with the kingdom that you’re

00:06:07.684 --> 00:06:11.711
part of, and once you manage to stop that war, you
can now enter that kingdom without being attacked.

00:06:11.711 --> 00:06:15.619
You have access to all the secrets and all the
knowledge and all the power that that kingdom has.

00:06:15.619 --> 00:06:19.859
That’s a really great long term reward
to add to the story as well

00:06:19.859 --> 00:06:22.349
that could tie into all the rest
of what I just discussed.

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:25.230
Looking over these, think of what different,
creative ways you can reward the players as your

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:30.331
story goes on to keep it both interesting, varied,
and for you at least, feel like you’re

00:06:30.331 --> 00:06:35.173
appropriately rewarding different
cool actions and successes that

00:06:35.173 --> 00:06:37.890
the party manages to achieve as they progress.

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:42.740
Thank you so much for watching! I hope this has
been somewhat helpful and entertaining for you as

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.920
a dungeon master, game master, or otherwise. You
can check out more of these videos on

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.312

way or another.
