1
00:00:00,651 --> 00:00:09,620
MATT: Oh, hi. I didn't see you there. I'm hanging
out this afternoon, apparently reading some

2
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:15,571
fantastic books, and excited to hang out with a
lot of you fun, interesting elements on the

3
00:00:15,571 --> 00:00:20,781
internet. But I figure, let's go ahead and make it
comfortable. Let's enjoy ourselves a little bit of

4
00:00:20,781 --> 00:00:26,670
personal time together and get to know a little
bit about each other. I've got some fine port here

5
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:34,911
to keep me company, like you do on a Tuesday
afternoon at 4:00pm. I poured a lot in there, so

6
00:00:34,911 --> 00:00:38,871
this is what's called not being the designated
driver.

7
00:00:38,871 --> 00:00:44,762
Anyway, I'm glad you could join me. We're going to
have a good time, hopefully. This is going to be a

8
00:00:44,762 --> 00:00:49,129
general hang out, get to know each other type
circumstance. As far as the types of questions,

9
00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:53,231
the quality of questions, they can be game
related, they can be Critical Role related, they

10
00:00:53,231 --> 00:00:57,591
can be role-playing game related, they can be
voice-over industry related, they can be just life

11
00:00:57,591 --> 00:01:02,852
related. They can be stuff about my history, or
telling me about your history. Just opening

12
00:01:02,852 --> 00:01:09,348
conversations about that. I want this to be an
open hangout, a whatever you're curious about, and

13
00:01:09,348 --> 00:01:14,482
then I might ask some curious things back. So
yeah, this is just a hangout.

14
00:01:14,482 --> 00:01:22,541
Thank you for the robe recommendation. This is the
finest quality I could find for $20 on Amazon. And

15
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:32,522
it met my expectations. It is every bit as shitty
as I expected. But anyway, welcome! We'll get a

16
00:01:32,522 --> 00:01:39,193
ways into this Q&amp;A, and then maybe we'll start
creating an NPC and a monster for the campaign a

17
00:01:39,193 --> 00:01:52,462
little ways down the road. So cheers! Oh, that is
nice! That is sweet! Anyway, glad you could join

18
00:01:52,462 --> 00:01:58,953
us. This will be interesting. Let's begin with
some fun questions here, if I can remember how to

19
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:05,390
get the pad here open. Possibly? Maybe? We'll find
out. If I learn technology, if you've seen the

20
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,993
Periscopes, you know that me and technology
strangely do not mix very well. But that's okay.

21
00:02:08,993 --> 00:02:17,053
First question I see in there is, "Where's
Larkin?" That's a better question for Liam

22
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:23,654
O'Brien. Larkin resides in the same location that
Raishan does, which is, as far as everyone knows,

23
00:02:23,654 --> 00:02:30,083
very deceased. By the way, for the record, if
you're not caught up on Critical Role, I'm going to

24
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:34,817
try and avoid spoilers, but something may squeeze
through, and I apologize in advance.

25
00:02:34,817 --> 00:02:45,264
"Did I fix the yard?" Fix is a relative term. I
got the yard mowed, and then the remnants of the

26
00:02:45,264 --> 00:02:51,914
mowing could fill eight or nine of our green bins.
So we've been slowly off-loading it week after

27
00:02:51,914 --> 00:02:58,715
week, and our yard in the meantime looks like a
series of hills. It's terrifying. But we <i>are</i>

28
00:02:58,715 --> 00:03:01,225
getting it taken care of, hopefully.

29
00:03:01,225 --> 00:03:12,555
Let's see what questions we've got here. It is a
Founders Reserve Porto. Sandeman! It looks like it

30
00:03:12,555 --> 00:03:16,925
has Darkman on the cover. I know people say Zorro.
I'm going to go Darkman because that's the person

31
00:03:16,925 --> 00:03:23,187
I am. If you haven't seen Darkman, it's awesome.
The first one. Don't see the rest of them. Leslie

32
00:03:23,187 --> 00:03:26,005
Nielsen, actually. The first thing I really knew
him from.

33
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:35,319
We'll get to the first question at the top.
"What's your favorite trope in D&amp;D, or just in

34
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:39,839
"general? What was your favorite storyline besides
the Chroma Conclave?" This is from Nikosia. Good

35
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:49,820
question. Favorite trope in D&amp;D? Those are fantasy
tropes in general, and I personally really like

36
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:58,068
political intrigue. The fight-the-monsters is fun,
but I like the idea of trying to balance that with

37
00:03:58,068 --> 00:04:03,749
nations that are warring or crumbling. There
hasn't been a lot of that in this campaign because

38
00:04:03,749 --> 00:04:07,360
I can't fit every theme and every trope in every
campaign. But I wouldn't be surprised if those

39
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,569
elements show up in campaigns down the road.
Personally, I really enjoy challenges that involve

40
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:19,509
more finesse besides just bursting into doors and
defeating creatures. So that's a big fan of mine.

41
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:26,280
As far as previous campaigns that I really
enjoyed? I ran the expedition at Castle Ravenloft,

42
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,341
and that was an absolute blast. I <i>adored</i> that
campaign as I ran it. So that one has a special

43
00:04:31,341 --> 00:04:34,908
place in my heart. And had some political
intrigue, which was fun.

44
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:42,369
What's another fun question? "What's my favorite
class in D&amp;D?" by Lairohi, which I'm probably

45
00:04:42,369 --> 00:04:50,579
butchering that. My apologies. Seriously, I'm
really sorry about that. I've always loved

46
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:55,971
casters; caster classes were a big thing for me
growing up. I love the options of spellcasting and

47
00:04:55,971 --> 00:05:00,892
the utility factor for a party. You may not be the
most powerful or the most survivable, except the

48
00:05:00,892 --> 00:05:05,299
later levels get powerful. It is nice to be able
to take care of some of those challenges. The rest

49
00:05:05,299 --> 00:05:10,274
of the party is like, "I don't know what to do!
We're kind of fucked!" And you're like, "Wait, I

50
00:05:10,274 --> 00:05:15,983
"got a spell for that!" You're essentially the Clippy
paperclip of D&amp;D, and I love that! That was a lot

51
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,987
of fun.

52
00:05:17,987 --> 00:05:22,312
That chatroom is moving really fast! We're
cultivating questions from the chat, so don't

53
00:05:22,312 --> 00:05:26,680
worry. Even if it goes past, we're keeping an
eye out. "Has the Raishan trophy mount arrived

54
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:33,772
"yet?" It has arrived. We haven't opened it yet.
We're planning another Critmas. Scheduling has

55
00:05:33,772 --> 00:05:39,113
been a pain in the butt, between completing the
campaign guide, general work, and multiple

56
00:05:39,113 --> 00:05:42,452
projects at once, and everyone else's busy
schedules, organizing another day to do a Critmas

57
00:05:42,452 --> 00:05:46,924
has been very arduous endeavor. But we're zeroing
down on it soon. We will have that soon, and then

58
00:05:46,924 --> 00:05:51,833
we'll have all of them, and we might actually be
adding them to the set over here pretty soon as

59
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,609
one. Once again, you guys are amazing! Thank you
again.

60
00:05:54,609 --> 00:06:02,483
"How surprised was I when Liam killed everyone
mid-last week?" from CritterNation3000. (laughs)

61
00:06:02,483 --> 00:06:10,261
Definitely surprised! I wasn't expecting him to
just throw out, you know, the Abyss against a

62
00:06:10,261 --> 00:06:17,261
bunch of level one us-es that early in. I had an
inkling he was going to do one of those you wake

63
00:06:17,261 --> 00:06:22,642
up and you're still okay in another realm or
you're out of your sleep circumstance, but the

64
00:06:22,642 --> 00:06:26,344
party was like it would also be fitting if he
literally brought me in to be a player for the

65
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:31,244
first time in a long time in his game and he
fucking throws a demogorgon at me and kills me in

66
00:06:31,244 --> 00:06:35,464
one hit. And that's it, and thanks Matt for
playing! Because as much as that sucks on one

67
00:06:35,464 --> 00:06:40,239
degree, that shit would be funny! That would be
<i>so</i> funny.

68
00:06:40,239 --> 00:06:46,625
I'm going to adjust this real fast because it's
turning off rather quickly on me. If I can find

69
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:53,766
it. Because I don't know where it's all organized!
Where is the settings on this son of a--! There it

70
00:06:53,766 --> 00:07:03,580
is! I see it. Pardon me, internet. I appreciate
your patience. We're going to head down to the

71
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:11,725
Control Center. General, display, auto-lock in 15
minutes. That'll work fine. Thank you. Pardon me

72
00:07:11,725 --> 00:07:18,241
for the slight delay there, friends. I appreciate
your patience. If I could pull it up to where I

73
00:07:18,241 --> 00:07:24,691
was. There we go. Thank you. I'm going to have
another sip of port because it's that kind of day.

74
00:07:24,691 --> 00:07:35,382
Glad you can come and join me. "Matt, did you know
that is not a real fireplace behind you?" from

75
00:07:35,382 --> 00:07:39,123
PSkinner.

76
00:07:39,123 --> 00:07:41,443
[off-screen] (laughter) It's a TV!

77
00:07:41,443 --> 00:07:49,364
MATT: I knew that. But I appreciate you looking
out. And it's really sweet of you. And even if I

78
00:07:49,364 --> 00:07:54,261
didn't know, and this was my actual home, and I
totally believed it was a fireplace, would you

79
00:07:54,261 --> 00:08:00,850
want to be the one person to tell me that it
wasn't? Do you want to be <i>that</i> guy that, out of

80
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:06,552
the sake of the necessity to be right, you would
tear down the illusion I built around me? Because

81
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:15,573
you are that guy. Think about that. <i>Goddamn</i>
that's good! Good call, Ryan! Ryan Green chose the

82
00:08:15,573 --> 00:08:17,943
drink of choice, and did a fine job.

83
00:08:17,943 --> 00:08:26,197
Good question! Thamgoule-- I'm going to butcher
all these names, sorry-- asks, "What do I think of

84
00:08:26,197 --> 00:08:34,273
"the new mystic class?" I've had a tumultuous
relationship with psionics for a large portion of

85
00:08:34,273 --> 00:08:42,347
their D&amp;D existence. I like the idea of
psychic-based classes, but the psychic points

86
00:08:42,347 --> 00:08:49,054
system always felt like it didn't fit in the rest
of the theme of D&amp;D from previous editions. I

87
00:08:49,054 --> 00:08:54,062
looked at the new mystic class, and it's got a lot
of really cool options. I'm uncertain of it. It

88
00:08:54,062 --> 00:09:02,534
seems like a lot of everything in one class. It
definitely has a few options that are extremely

89
00:09:02,534 --> 00:09:06,584
overpowered, which is why it's in test and why the
Unearthed Arcana is a really good place to try

90
00:09:06,584 --> 00:09:12,720
these things out and give feedback, and they can
tweak it down the road. I feel like it does feel a

91
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,734
bit trying to accomplish everything at once. So
I'd like to see it maybe be a little more fine

92
00:09:18,734 --> 00:09:22,952
tuned into a theme that stood out amongst the
classes, which is hard because the classes-- as a

93
00:09:22,952 --> 00:09:28,204
person who's designed and tried to design unique
things in the game, a lot of bases are already

94
00:09:28,204 --> 00:09:34,205
covered. So you really got to stick to a unique
style, or try your best to, at the very least. I

95
00:09:34,205 --> 00:09:38,893
like the idea of the mystics. I'm not sold on them
yet. I'm curious to see after testing if they ever

96
00:09:38,893 --> 00:09:45,294
release an official document with a final design,
and to see how that turns out. I'd like to take a

97
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:53,294
look at it as we go and give some feedback of my
own. Maybe I will, Wizards of the Coast. Moving on!

98
00:09:53,294 --> 00:10:00,465
A question from Alesia Shaeffer. "When starting
the campaign, how much did you start with? What

99
00:10:00,465 --> 00:10:09,075
"level did everyone start at?" Everyone started at
level three at the time. I could have gone earlier

100
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:14,855
level, but I thought it was just a one-shot. And I
wanted it to be enough of a character ability

101
00:10:14,855 --> 00:10:19,115
spread that they had at least a number of options
at their disposal. So it was a level three

102
00:10:19,115 --> 00:10:24,174
one-shot. The characters were originally built in
4th edition for that one-shot because it was the

103
00:10:24,174 --> 00:10:29,382
most button-push, I tell you the three abilities
you have and how often you can use them and then

104
00:10:29,382 --> 00:10:34,505
we play the game. And that's how it came together.
Once it became a campaign, then we converted over

105
00:10:34,505 --> 00:10:39,265
to Pathfinder. We were already at level three, and
it was fine. And it went from there. If you're new

106
00:10:39,265 --> 00:10:45,067
to D&amp;D, I highly recommend starting at level one
for at least a few games because it's enough where

107
00:10:45,067 --> 00:10:47,855
you can learn the rules without feeling overloaded
with options, especially if you're playing a

108
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:52,543
caster. Once you've played a game or two where you
feel more comfortable, starting a campaign around

109
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:55,665
level two, or halfway through two, which is what
I'm doing for the next campaign, I think is good

110
00:10:55,665 --> 00:10:58,581
because it doesn't feel like you're having to
trudge through that very first level if you know

111
00:10:58,581 --> 00:11:05,236
the game pretty well and have enough experience.
But also you're not locked into your archetypes

112
00:11:05,236 --> 00:11:08,455
for your class, so based on the choices and
experiences you have in the first few sessions,

113
00:11:08,455 --> 00:11:12,958
that can really inform the direction you want the
character to take. So by the time you level up to

114
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:16,324
level three, you've had a few games under your
belt, and you can make an informed decision on the

115
00:11:16,324 --> 00:11:19,895
type of variation of that class you want to
pursue. So that's my opinion.

116
00:11:19,895 --> 00:11:30,095
Got some more questions. "What is my favorite
tabletop RPG system?" from Thermavoire.

117
00:11:30,095 --> 00:11:37,655
Thermavoire, that's fun. It sounds like Theramore,
which didn't do so well in the lore of Warcraft, so

118
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:44,627
I'm glad you changed the pronunciation. I'm
partial to D&amp;D just because it means so much to me

119
00:11:44,627 --> 00:11:49,456
as far as the genre. I'm a big high fantasy
person. It's the first game I ever played. It's

120
00:11:49,456 --> 00:11:55,641
the game that I play most often now. The newer
editions have gotten a lot better about weaving

121
00:11:55,641 --> 00:12:03,886
narrative into actual gameplay. But I don't know.
I really dug the Palladium system. I'm kidding;

122
00:12:03,886 --> 00:12:07,966
that's not true. The Palladium system's
ridiculous. I like the themes of some of the

123
00:12:07,966 --> 00:12:12,357
games, like the ridiculousness of Rifts, but when
you start getting into 1d4 times one million

124
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,567
mega-damage weapons, it gets a little intense.

125
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:27,529
I like them all for different reasons.
Unique-wise, I really enjoyed the Amber Diceless

126
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:30,448
roleplaying game. For those who haven't read the
Amber series. It's actually a pretty cool series

127
00:12:30,448 --> 00:12:36,377
of books, and it's an RPG that the system is based
more upon the GM logistically considering what

128
00:12:36,377 --> 00:12:41,756
succeeds versus what fails based on character
creation and ingenuity and how you present the

129
00:12:41,756 --> 00:12:46,358
challenge and your answer to it. I thought that
was a pretty cool way of doing it, though the

130
00:12:46,358 --> 00:12:54,299
randomization of the dice makes things
interesting, too, so I like that. The Traveler

131
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:58,965
system was fun! The Traveler system is great. One
of the few games you can die in character

132
00:12:58,965 --> 00:13:04,907
creation, liked that in Paranoia. That was a good
one. I'm probably going to have to stick with 5th

133
00:13:04,907 --> 00:13:09,840
edition right now. I think it's a nice blend of
enough rules and numbers and interesting character

134
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:15,388
options that you can still create and customize a
character, but still be an easy flow from

135
00:13:15,388 --> 00:13:20,461
narrative to combat. It's not perfect. No system
is really perfect, from my standpoint, at least.

136
00:13:20,461 --> 00:13:24,192
But it's closest to the kind of system that I
would want to play. I actually like that a lot.

137
00:13:24,192 --> 00:13:36,666
From Zemedelfos-- which sounds like something you'd
fight in Xenogears. Question! "What do you

138
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:40,108
"recommend when you have players that it's hard to
get all together, but have no good reason for the

139
00:13:40,108 --> 00:13:43,599
"character to suddenly pop in and out between
sessions? Not many of them are big into jaegering

140
00:13:43,599 --> 00:13:47,138
"another person's character." That's actually a
very good question; I've had this challenge many

141
00:13:47,138 --> 00:13:55,128
times. There are a couple ways you could do it. If
your party is not terribly locked into having to

142
00:13:55,128 --> 00:14:00,849
keep a very realistic narrative, and you can
introduce somewhat silly suspension-of-disbelief

143
00:14:00,849 --> 00:14:07,378
moments in the game, you can introduce elements
like the heroes, as part of this venture, were all

144
00:14:07,378 --> 00:14:13,266
cursed or locked to a specific artifact and at
randomized times it will fold or steal the players

145
00:14:13,266 --> 00:14:16,758
into an alternate reality. And so when the players
can't be there, all of a sudden the orb claims

146
00:14:16,758 --> 00:14:21,449
them and they're not there, and they have to wait
for them to return. Also, having ventures where

147
00:14:21,449 --> 00:14:26,938
the planes can be unstable, and occasionally
individuals fade from one realm to the other

148
00:14:26,938 --> 00:14:31,188
without given warning. And that can be part of the
overall narrative: to stop these planes from

149
00:14:31,188 --> 00:14:36,748
crossing. And thus, different party members can
vanish and come back, and it doesn't really affect

150
00:14:36,748 --> 00:14:40,408
the narrative flow because you've already
established a reason of that being the case. So

151
00:14:40,408 --> 00:14:44,744
you can run it more narrative-level like that, you
can make it like I do where you try and come up

152
00:14:44,744 --> 00:14:48,659
with a creative reason for them to leave. If
you're in the middle of a circumstance, you can

153
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:51,678
have them kidnapped by a monster, and now part of
the adventure is also trying to save them. It's

154
00:14:51,678 --> 00:15:01,128
the eternal challenge. It's not an easy answer for
it. It's easier if you're playing more of a

155
00:15:01,128 --> 00:15:05,978
tongue-in-cheek game and you all can lean into it
a bit, and there could even be, in the same realm,

156
00:15:05,978 --> 00:15:10,749
like a curse that befit the party and on certain
phases of the moon, you might turn into cardboard.

157
00:15:10,749 --> 00:15:13,758
And players have to fold you and put you in the
bag of holding until you're ready to come out

158
00:15:13,758 --> 00:15:17,819
again in your full form. Those silly ways make it
a lot easier and you can have fun with it that

159
00:15:17,819 --> 00:15:21,640
way. But when you need a narrative, you can try to
find an overarching reason as to why they have to

160
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:26,239
jump in and out occasionally. It's not easy! I
don't have a great answer for it, but that's the

161
00:15:26,239 --> 00:15:29,319
best I can give you, because that's all I've done
in the past.

162
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:38,959
Question from PhantomsRuinLives, "Any tips on
dealing with audition nerves waiting to hear back

163
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:48,078
"on an audition?" Yes! Audition nerves never go
away. And I know you're like, "Oh god!" I mean,

164
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:54,009
they'll dwindle over time, but those butterflies
never go away. In fact, you learn to harness them,

165
00:15:54,009 --> 00:15:58,814
you learn to use that nervous energy as a positive
thing. Part of that only comes with experience.

166
00:15:58,814 --> 00:16:08,225
Another is coming to terms with the fact that
you're not there to prove that you're right for

167
00:16:08,225 --> 00:16:12,545
the job. They're just seeking whoever is right for
the job, and if it happens to be you, it's you. If

168
00:16:12,545 --> 00:16:15,788
it's not, it's not. So the pressure isn't to be
better than other people. It's to be the best you

169
00:16:15,788 --> 00:16:20,158
can be for yourself. And if you're right for that
particular role that you auditioned for, then

170
00:16:20,158 --> 00:16:24,911
they'll probably book you. And if not, somebody
else was better for it, it doesn't mean they're

171
00:16:24,911 --> 00:16:29,559
better than you, but they were a better fit for
that one character. And trying to keep that

172
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:34,209
mindset over time. It's not a you versus them
mentality. You're doing your very best, and if you

173
00:16:34,209 --> 00:16:37,570
don't get it, it's not because you're bad,
necessarily. It's because you weren't right for

174
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:42,432
that particular job. And as a casting director,
you're not just casting people. You're weaving a

175
00:16:42,432 --> 00:16:49,039
tapestry. Where you're reading for one character,
they have a view of the entire cast, all the

176
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:52,910
characters and archetypes and story elements that
have to weave together. So they might audition you

177
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:58,681
and other people that sound amazing for the roles,
but you might sound too similar. And so as an

178
00:16:58,681 --> 00:17:05,050
ensemble, it doesn't work to have you both in
these roles that are so close together. So they

179
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:09,510
might cast somebody else for that. That doesn't
mean that you weren't great for the job, but for

180
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:14,525
the sake of casting the project as a whole, they
had to go with something else. But they'll still

181
00:17:14,525 --> 00:17:17,872
keep you in mind for stuff down the road. That's
another thing, too. Even if you don't book

182
00:17:17,872 --> 00:17:22,221
something, if you knock it out of the park in the
audition, people will keep you in mind. I can't

183
00:17:22,221 --> 00:17:26,081
tell you how many projects that I've read for and
didn't book anything, and then a year and a half,

184
00:17:26,081 --> 00:17:29,152
two years later, they call me in to read on
something or book me on something because they're

185
00:17:29,152 --> 00:17:33,170
like, "Loved your read for that! Wasn't right for
the character, but something else came up down the

186
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:36,422
"road that we liked you for. And we wanted to have
you read on that now, too." So it can help you

187
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:40,821
regardless. Don't be too hard on yourself for not
booking a gig. The auditioning process is part of

188
00:17:40,821 --> 00:17:42,581
the learning and the experience.

189
00:17:42,581 --> 00:17:48,372
Also, I recommend don't wait to hear back on an
audition. A really healthy mindset when it comes

190
00:17:48,372 --> 00:17:51,770
to that process, whether it be voiceover,
on-camera, everything, is to do your best. You're

191
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:56,411
doing the job in the room. You're doing the best
you can, and then once it's done, let it go and

192
00:17:56,411 --> 00:18:01,071
move on to the next endeavor. Focus on the next
opportunity. Focus on the next class you can take.

193
00:18:01,071 --> 00:18:07,149
Focus on the next character you can explore. And
let that audition go. It may take some time to

194
00:18:07,149 --> 00:18:11,528
learn that type of behavior, but you really have
to release it. That way, if it doesn't happen,

195
00:18:11,528 --> 00:18:15,525
you've already forgotten about it and you're
already focusing on bigger and better things. If

196
00:18:15,525 --> 00:18:22,521
it does happen, that's a fantastic surprise! So
that's my recommendation in that regard, too. This

197
00:18:22,521 --> 00:18:29,301
is delicious. I will try my best not to get
extremely intoxicated. I do not promise anything.

198
00:18:29,301 --> 00:18:41,508
FickedUp asks, "Have I ever LARPed?" I have not
field character costume LARPed yet. I haven't

199
00:18:41,508 --> 00:18:49,342
because I haven't had time or because I'm scared
I'll like it too much. I have a lot of friends

200
00:18:49,342 --> 00:18:53,790
that do it, and it's consumed them. It's become
their biggest hobby. They put all this time and

201
00:18:53,790 --> 00:19:00,170
energy into costumes and stuff, and I know I would
do that. And I just have too much stuff going on.

202
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:06,788
I have LARPed Vampire once. I was pulled into a
LARP. It was up in Simi Valley in the early

203
00:19:06,788 --> 00:19:12,032
2000's, and it was this huge chapter of a bunch of
theater kids from a theater magnet school that I

204
00:19:12,032 --> 00:19:15,861
met through community theater, and they invited me
to come be part of this. I had no backstory on it,

205
00:19:15,861 --> 00:19:20,882
and I was thrust into a very political figure that
was introduced by the prince of that whole area as

206
00:19:20,882 --> 00:19:25,362
his new right-hand man. So I became this political
intrigue focus for the evening with <i>no</i>

207
00:19:25,362 --> 00:19:29,962
backstory, no idea of how the political dynamics
worked. And I was thrown to the wolves, if you

208
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:35,746
will. And there were wolves there. Werewolves,
anyway. So it wasn't the <i>best</i> experience. It was

209
00:19:35,746 --> 00:19:40,582
unique, it was different. But I was out of my
element there and got spooked off a bit from that.

210
00:19:40,582 --> 00:19:46,546
I still had a good time, but if I had another
chance I know what to ask for, as far as research

211
00:19:46,546 --> 00:19:53,074
and background to actually fit in. I think it's
awesome! I did run a show for a while called

212
00:19:53,074 --> 00:19:58,260
Adventure, a stage show that my friend, Coleman,
ran. Marisha was part of it, and Bonnie Gordon,

213
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:02,253
who you've seen here a ton, she was part of it.
Xander came and played a number of times. Our

214
00:20:02,253 --> 00:20:09,592
fantastic Taliesin was in it with us. Courtney,
our fantastic Alpha mistress over there, she came

215
00:20:09,592 --> 00:20:15,807
and was part of it many times. It was a live
roleplay stage show where we pulled members from

216
00:20:15,807 --> 00:20:20,082
the audience as PCs, and we'd pull them through a
storyline where we were the NPCs, changing

217
00:20:20,082 --> 00:20:24,043
costumes behind the scenes and going from sequence
to sequence. It was a lot of fun. I guess that's

218
00:20:24,043 --> 00:20:30,369
the closest thing I've done to LARPing. But once
again, always NPCs, always the DM. It's fine.

219
00:20:30,369 --> 00:20:38,512
Let's start our first poll. Let's start getting
some of our fun character design stuff going here.

220
00:20:38,512 --> 00:20:45,693
Let's begin with the NPC on this one. How it's
going to work is I'm going to start asking for

221
00:20:45,693 --> 00:20:50,853
some suggestions from the chat and keeping an eye
out when I ask for a certain thing. And then I'll

222
00:20:50,853 --> 00:20:55,097
pick a few, we'll throw them into a straw poll.
That straw poll will be up for about a minute,

223
00:20:55,097 --> 00:20:59,594
minute and a half. So you'll rush in when the
link's available in the chat, vote, and then when

224
00:20:59,594 --> 00:21:05,432
that time is up, we'll call it, and that's what
we're going with for that aspect of the NPC. First

225
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:14,872
and foremost, let's pick a race for the NPC. Type
into the chat here what race you think it should

226
00:21:14,872 --> 00:21:21,342
be. We're talking if it's human, halfling,
tiefling, half-orc, goliath, anything you want,

227
00:21:21,342 --> 00:21:26,994
just type them in there. I'm going to pay
attention for a second to see what seems to be

228
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:35,004
popping up more often than not. Oh, that's a lot!
I can see forever! Seeing a lot of half-orc; we'll

229
00:21:35,004 --> 00:21:44,524
put half-orc on there. That'll be one of them.
We're passing by a lot of human, and a lot of

230
00:21:44,524 --> 00:21:53,794
drow. That'll be interesting, too. Hmm, you guys
haven't seen much drow in Tal'Dorei. Hmm. They're

231
00:21:53,794 --> 00:22:03,023
there, which you'll see in the campaign guide. And
dragonborn. So that's four, and we'll do one more.

232
00:22:03,023 --> 00:22:10,124
A lot of genasi. Going some unique classes there,
and a little human thrown in just for some

233
00:22:10,124 --> 00:22:25,511
averageness. I believe that is drow, half-orc,
genasi, human, and dragonborn. Cool! So we're

234
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:30,034
going to go ahead and get that situated for you
guys here in a moment. We'll have the voting start

235
00:22:30,034 --> 00:22:32,298
for that race, we'll have about two minutes, and
then we'll come back with an answer, and that will

236
00:22:32,298 --> 00:22:38,484
set in the race for the NPC. It's fun, communal
construction. I haven't done it like this. This

237
00:22:38,484 --> 00:22:44,299
will be fun. Once that straw poll is done, the
link will be in the chat, and vote. In the

238
00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:46,474
meantime, I'm going answer another question.

239
00:22:46,474 --> 00:22:53,294
George Fletcher asks, "What is your favorite kind
of cheese?" See, I like these questions. I like

240
00:22:53,294 --> 00:22:58,048
these strange, non-game-related-ones peppered
through. Interesting, weird tidbits of things

241
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:05,805
you've ever wondered about why I'm such a weird
person. Because I'm a very weird person. Favorite

242
00:23:05,805 --> 00:23:13,410
type of cheese? I really like smoked goudas. I've
actually recently gotten really a fan of extra

243
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:21,913
aged gouda. It has a slight caramel-ish, almost
crunchy crystals in it. That with some pita chips,

244
00:23:21,913 --> 00:23:35,145
and some wine is good. Or some honey. What would I
pair with my current drink? I have no idea! I'm

245
00:23:35,145 --> 00:23:42,775
not a wine and cheese snob. I know so little. I'm
really good at trying to-- actually, no. I'm

246
00:23:42,775 --> 00:23:47,825
really bad at trying to fake like I'm a cultured
person, because I don't know. Have you seen my

247
00:23:47,825 --> 00:23:56,346
dragon socks, okay? I am not at all a cultured
person. For this, honestly, probably s'mores. This

248
00:23:56,346 --> 00:24:00,375
is a very sweet port. So I'd go more of a smores.
It's not cheese, but deal with it! That's my

249
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:04,657
answer. Anyway. Next question.

250
00:24:04,657 --> 00:24:15,333
From Galastan, question, "Hey, Matt, thanks for
being my lifelong inspiration. I'm planning to

251
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:17,929
"break into the VO industry and currently taking
voice acting lessons. Is there anything else you

252
00:24:17,929 --> 00:24:22,205
"recommend doing to get an edge in an admittedly
cut-throat industry?" That's an interesting

253
00:24:22,205 --> 00:24:30,346
question. Cold reading training. I've said it
before and I'll say it again. Training in classic

254
00:24:30,346 --> 00:24:35,196
forms of acting and performance is so important.
Being comfortable and experienced enough to where

255
00:24:35,196 --> 00:24:39,600
you can jump into a scene and make confident
choices, not worrying if they're the right choices,

256
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,666
but whatever feels natural. That's the thing, too.
A lot of people get caught up in their head about,

257
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:46,824
"Am I making the right decisions? Am I making the
right impulses? Am I feeling this out correctly?"

258
00:24:46,824 --> 00:24:50,156
As long as you're making <i>some</i> choice, you're
doing it right because you're going with your

259
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:53,815
instincts and it's taking you there. And if it's
not the right direction, the director, who it's

260
00:24:53,815 --> 00:24:58,157
their job, will guide you back on track. But they
much prefer to have somebody who's bold in their

261
00:24:58,157 --> 00:25:03,926
choices and commits to the path they take as
opposed to somebody who's unable to decide which

262
00:25:03,926 --> 00:25:10,136
path they want to go with a character choice. So
that's big. But for voice over in particular, read

263
00:25:10,136 --> 00:25:15,525
out loud, whatever. Don't even look at it! Get a
script, or get a book, throw it in front of you,

264
00:25:15,525 --> 00:25:19,979
and start reading out loud as you read it for the
first time, because that's most of the job. You

265
00:25:19,979 --> 00:25:24,768
want to take scripts and learn to cold read. Most
of the job is cold reading. Rarely do you get a

266
00:25:24,768 --> 00:25:30,115
script in advance for a project, and most of the
time, you walk into the booth, and you're around

267
00:25:30,115 --> 00:25:33,595
sound proofing, by yourself, with a glass window
and a director, and multiple other people in the

268
00:25:33,595 --> 00:25:43,939
room looking at you through it going, "Okay, go."
And you have to go! That's the job. Cold reading,

269
00:25:43,939 --> 00:25:48,215
learning to be comfortable to read things
spontaneously as you receive them out loud. Listen

270
00:25:48,215 --> 00:25:53,397
back; record yourself doing it and listen and you
can self-critique and work on your annunciation.

271
00:25:53,397 --> 00:25:59,186
Work on understanding the flow of dialogue. Don't
be afraid to take beats. A lot of people,

272
00:25:59,186 --> 00:26:03,415
especially when they begin, they read everything
through. But characters breathe, they have

273
00:26:03,415 --> 00:26:09,086
thoughts mid-sentence, they stammer. So another
thing, too, is breathing life into a scene as a

274
00:26:09,086 --> 00:26:12,976
character. Consider what action they're taking
during it. If you read a scene where a person's in

275
00:26:12,976 --> 00:26:17,088
a kitchen, you read the dialogue as, "Well, yeah,
of course. But if we're going to go on a vacation,

276
00:26:17,088 --> 00:26:22,209
"least we can do is try and bring the family." Or,
think about them doing the dishes a minute, like,

277
00:26:22,209 --> 00:26:26,937
"Well, of course. (grunts). I mean, if we're going
to go on <i>vacation</i>, we might as well bring the

278
00:26:26,937 --> 00:26:31,785
"<i>family</i>." Suddenly, even though it's just audio,
you imagine that person doing a physical activity.

279
00:26:31,785 --> 00:26:36,369
You immediately envision a part of the kitchen
that wasn't there before. Think of the character,

280
00:26:36,369 --> 00:26:40,739
think of beats, moments, exerts, things that can
breathe life into their physicality, even though

281
00:26:40,739 --> 00:26:45,606
you're just reading their voice out loud. Those
are good things to keep in mind as you're learning

282
00:26:45,606 --> 00:26:49,246
a scene or playing out a character. And if it's
not the right choice, the director, once again,

283
00:26:49,246 --> 00:26:51,916
will correct you. But rather have you make
choices than not.

284
00:26:51,916 --> 00:27:01,784
Do we have an answer on the straw poll? Drow by
60%?! Oh, man! We might be getting some story on

285
00:27:01,784 --> 00:27:10,046
the Ruhn-Shak soon. You don't know what that is.
You will in August. The NPC race is drow; we have

286
00:27:10,046 --> 00:27:21,742
a drow NPC. We are off to the races! Okay, so now
that we have a drow NPC, think of the occupation

287
00:27:21,742 --> 00:27:29,897
that drow has. That can be a character class or it
can be a position, like a politician, or a guild

288
00:27:29,897 --> 00:27:38,048
master, or an artisan, or a cutthroat, or a
mastermind or whatever you think an occupation for

289
00:27:38,048 --> 00:27:43,574
this NPC would be good for. Spy is a good one.
Okay, we'll look at this for a second, we'll see

290
00:27:43,574 --> 00:27:55,357
what comes through. I see a lot of warlock; we'll
put warlock on there. I see a lot of baker!

291
00:27:55,357 --> 00:28:14,237
There's a lot of bakers in there! It's a big
spread. Warlock, baker. I see a lot of prince;

292
00:28:14,237 --> 00:28:19,397
they want some royalty, some sort of royal or
noble blood involved in there. That'll be

293
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:31,747
interesting. You guys are ridiculous. Bounty
hunter's come up quite a bit. That's a fun one.

294
00:28:31,747 --> 00:28:42,857
Okay, I'm going to go for a last one here. Oh my
god, it's like looking into the Matrix! It's

295
00:28:42,857 --> 00:28:53,745
(whoosh). There's a lot of prostitute, which is
rad, because sex trade's an awesome, legitimate

296
00:28:53,745 --> 00:28:57,527
form of business for a lot of good people. So
prostitute's in there. So what is the listing we

297
00:28:57,527 --> 00:29:07,424
have? Warlock, baker, royalty, bounty hunter,
prostitute. We're going to go ahead and get that

298
00:29:07,424 --> 00:29:13,518
straw poll going here in a minute. Take a minute
or two to vote, and we'll see where this takes us.

299
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:18,477
This should be very unique.

300
00:29:18,477 --> 00:29:34,129
Okay, then. So back to the next question here.
Arthur Dent asks, "Question: How do you set

301
00:29:34,129 --> 00:29:41,359
"magical item prices?" This is a good question.
There is, in the DMG, in the magical item treasure

302
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:49,013
section early into it, there is a table that gives
you the general price range for items by rarity.

303
00:29:49,013 --> 00:29:54,057
So you go from common, uncommon, rare, very rare,
and legendary. And it gives you 500 gold to 5,000

304
00:29:54,057 --> 00:29:59,217
gold, 5,000 gold to 50,000 gold. Yeah, it doesn't
really help a lot. So it comes with understanding

305
00:29:59,217 --> 00:30:05,549
power levels in the game. If it's a very rare
item, but it's a <i>pretty damn powerful</i> very rare

306
00:30:05,549 --> 00:30:09,729
item, I'm like, "Damn, that's a good very rare
item with a lot of abilities!" I'll probably set

307
00:30:09,729 --> 00:30:14,748
that a little higher up. It's a 5,000 to 50,000
and that's a really powerful item, I'll set it at

308
00:30:14,748 --> 00:30:22,811
40 to 45,000 gold. And if they want to persuade
whoever's selling it down a little bit, maybe. If

309
00:30:22,811 --> 00:30:32,589
it's an uncommon, which is pretty low, I think
it's 50 to 500, and it's pretty easy and minimal,

310
00:30:32,589 --> 00:30:37,974
like a tanglefoot bag, I'll probably set it about
50, 60 gold tops. Nothing too big. A lot of it is

311
00:30:37,974 --> 00:30:44,279
improvising it based on the range that's in the
GM's guide and the power level how I understand

312
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:50,554
it. Doesn't mean that it's right or wrong, but as
a GM, you get to set those based on your

313
00:30:50,554 --> 00:30:54,790
experience. It's okay if you mess it up a little
from what you consider; the players won't know any

314
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:59,318
better. It's your world; you set the prices. I
recommend you writing them down. Prices can change

315
00:30:59,318 --> 00:31:02,590
from person to person. Prices aren't the same
everywhere. An item might be really common in one

316
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:05,880
town, and really uncommon in another across the
continent. So the prices might be jacked up in

317
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:11,262
those various places. It's a combination of
improvising based on what I can ascertain of the

318
00:31:11,262 --> 00:31:18,299
item's power level, along with the range they give
in the DMG. I hope that's helpful.

319
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:25,539
Question from Niche asks, "Are you surprised by
what some of what Vox Machina has decided to do in

320
00:31:25,539 --> 00:31:30,469
"this past year?" Yes, actually, and I'm excited.
We actually got together last night and went

321
00:31:30,469 --> 00:31:34,120
through what everyone wanted to accomplish, did
some rolls. It was a throwback to our early days

322
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:38,780
playing at home, in some ways. It wasn't a full
session, but for things they wanted to accomplish,

323
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:45,048
there were rolls to see if the challenge succeeded
or not. And what we're going to do is begin the

324
00:31:45,048 --> 00:31:49,100
session on Thursday going through those lists,
discussing what happened, and possibly playing out

325
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:55,835
a few scenes that involve what they're hoping to
accomplish. So that's going to be what Thursday

326
00:31:55,835 --> 00:32:00,260
begins with. It's going to be fun. It's going to
be interesting; there's some interesting choices.

327
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:05,031
Grog has one thing in particular that the players
don't know about that's going to be real

328
00:32:05,031 --> 00:32:12,502
interesting. Grog's such a terrible person. Okay,
are we about good to close that straw poll?

329
00:32:12,502 --> 00:32:26,720
Baker?! Drow baker! We have a drow baker. That's
going to be awesome. I am excited about this.

330
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:35,181
BuiltTooFast says, "Is bloodhunter being added
into your campaign?" There <i>was</i> a bloodhunter NPC

331
00:32:35,181 --> 00:32:41,346
and the bloodhunter orders are part of the
Exandria lore. They mostly stem from Wildemount.

332
00:32:41,346 --> 00:32:47,291
But yes, there is, called the Claret orders,
within Exandria. They haven't come within

333
00:32:47,291 --> 00:32:51,999
Tal'Dorei. They haven't come prominently into the
story. I don't know if they will. We'll see how

334
00:32:51,999 --> 00:32:55,902
that plays out. But they are part of Tal'Dorei.

335
00:32:55,902 --> 00:33:08,745
So, next question, and then we'll get back to the
next bit for the NPC. SirRays, "Question about

336
00:33:08,745 --> 00:33:13,909
"life. You always try to be positive and
down-to-earth. How do you do it?" (laughs) I don't

337
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:23,882
always succeed. I don't know. That's interesting;
it's a weird question. I don't know, just be

338
00:33:23,882 --> 00:33:33,924
empathic. Be willing to make mistakes and own up
to them. Learn from them, and no matter how much a

339
00:33:33,924 --> 00:33:42,226
person frustrates you, makes you angry or tries to
hurt you, maintain a point of perspective that you

340
00:33:42,226 --> 00:33:48,153
don't understand what they've gone through to get
them there; what their day was leading them to

341
00:33:48,153 --> 00:33:56,183
that moment. What abuses they've undergone, what
difficulties, challenges, and failures they're

342
00:33:56,183 --> 00:33:59,353
ruminating on at that time, and you've become an
outlet for it.

343
00:33:59,353 --> 00:34:03,574
That's not always the case. There are bad people
in the world, by all means, and I do understand

344
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:08,653
that. But I think a lot of dissidence stems from
people's inability to imagine what the other side

345
00:34:08,653 --> 00:34:13,706
of this might be. So allowing yourself that
expansion, to be able to give people the benefit

346
00:34:13,706 --> 00:34:17,883
of the doubt and think, "I know what they said is
really terrible, but maybe they're having a really

347
00:34:17,883 --> 00:34:23,051
terrible day, week, month. Maybe they lost a
friend or family member, and they're just lashing

348
00:34:23,051 --> 00:34:28,386
out." You don't know. That perspective makes it a
lot easier to not take things to heart and step

349
00:34:28,386 --> 00:34:33,882
away. And that opens empathy for others.

350
00:34:33,882 --> 00:34:38,806
And that even goes for everyday encounters. When
you stop at a gas station to order gas, make eye

351
00:34:38,806 --> 00:34:43,914
contact with the attendant and ask them how their
day's been. It's amazing how quickly you'll see

352
00:34:43,914 --> 00:34:50,857
people open up and smile when you engage them as a
human being and not as just part of a transaction.

353
00:34:50,857 --> 00:34:56,645
I recommend you try that on a day-to-day basis. It
makes every day that much more lively. It makes

354
00:34:56,645 --> 00:35:00,976
you really appreciate how so many different
backgrounds, how many different people who all

355
00:35:00,976 --> 00:35:05,345
have their own story, their own trials and
tribulations, and they all come together to make

356
00:35:05,345 --> 00:35:10,085
this beautiful world that we all live in. So good
days and bad days. We're all human beings and

357
00:35:10,085 --> 00:35:18,015
we're all trying to be happy. Keep that in mind.
That helps; it's helped me so far.

358
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:25,644
We're now getting to the next aspect of the NPC's
design here. So they are a drow baker, according

359
00:35:25,644 --> 00:35:37,764
to chat's design. What is their interest in Vox
Machina? Which, if there are any members of Vox

360
00:35:37,764 --> 00:35:41,218
Machina on the sound stage, they should be
leaving right now because we're getting

361
00:35:41,277 --> 00:35:42,637
into narrative elements.

362
00:35:42,637 --> 00:35:43,267
TALIESIN: Bye!

363
00:35:43,267 --> 00:35:44,718
MATT: Taliesin Jaffe!

364
00:35:44,718 --> 00:35:48,588
TALIESIN: Bye. I'm going now. You have pretty
eyes.

365
00:35:48,588 --> 00:35:53,728
MATT: <i>You</i> have pretty eyes. He does have really
pretty eyes. He has <i>really</i> pretty eyes.

366
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:59,040
(clicks tongue) That got weird...or did it?

367
00:35:59,105 --> 00:36:08,800
The baker's interest in Vox Machina. All right,
well, <i>Grog</i> has been put in a bunch. So there's

368
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:16,011
an interest in Grog. I can expand upon that if
that should win. So we have Grog as one option.

369
00:36:16,011 --> 00:36:32,221
People here are throwing out wedding. So I'll put
that in there. Vengeance. Vengeance is always a

370
00:36:32,221 --> 00:36:44,196
fun one, and a nice change up from the previous
suggestions you've given. This is a lot here. I

371
00:36:44,196 --> 00:36:47,778
know this is a rough process, guys. We're all
figuring this out as we go, but we're trying the

372
00:36:47,778 --> 00:36:48,967
best we can.

373
00:36:57,278 --> 00:37:04,538
We're getting a lot of repeating ones that
we've already said. Okay, fanboy I've seen

374
00:37:04,538 --> 00:37:19,357
come up quite a few times. We'll go with that. And
the last one will be: bring Tary home. <i>That's</i>

375
00:37:19,357 --> 00:37:30,914
interesting. We got-- what was it again? Grog,
wedding, vengeance, fanboy, bring Tary home. Those

376
00:37:30,914 --> 00:37:35,489
are the five choices. We're going to throw those
up in the chat on the straw poll. Take a minute or

377
00:37:35,489 --> 00:37:39,849
two to get your votes in. We'll see which one of
those comes out on top. This is a very interesting

378
00:37:39,849 --> 00:37:45,648
process. (evil laugh) People saying mic is low? I
don't know if that's the case, or it was just

379
00:37:45,648 --> 00:37:52,959
their screen. But if it's just your computer, too
bad! Turn up your volume!

380
00:37:52,959 --> 00:37:59,148
Next question, "Pineapples on pizza? Yea or nay?"
Eh. I made a third option. I've had it, and it's

381
00:37:59,148 --> 00:38:02,909
all right. Not my preference. I wouldn't go out of
my way to order pineapples on pizza. But if

382
00:38:02,909 --> 00:38:05,619
pineapples show up on pizza, it's the only pizza
there, I'm not going to be like, "I will not eat

383
00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:12,459
you!" I'll go, "All right," and I'll eat it. I'm
in between. Not meant to be a cop out. Literally,

384
00:38:12,539 --> 00:38:21,707
that is my answer. I hope that was helpful? That
was from KidCross, by the way. Thank you, Kid.

385
00:38:21,707 --> 00:38:24,978
RossReynolds asks, "How do you balance your major
part in Critical Role and your career as a voice

386
00:38:24,978 --> 00:38:29,918
actor?" I'm still figuring it out! Oh, thank you,
Ryan.

387
00:38:29,918 --> 00:38:30,805
RYAN: Your popcorn, sir.

388
00:38:30,805 --> 00:38:36,209
MATT: "Wondrous! Oh, look at this delivery system.
It's glorious." The robe made me Gilmore suddenly.

389
00:38:36,209 --> 00:38:41,529
I don't know why. I'm going to have some more of
that port! This isn't a bad way to spend a Tuesday

390
00:38:41,529 --> 00:38:46,458
afternoon with you guys. Thanks for chilling with
me. This is good.

391
00:38:46,458 --> 00:38:55,981
"How do I balance Critical Role with being a voice
actor?" I don't know yet. I'm still working on it.

392
00:38:55,981 --> 00:39:04,810
When you live a career for long enough that could
end tomorrow, and you don't know where you're next

393
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:13,160
paycheck is coming from, and it's a passion, you
end up doing odd jobs to make rent. Doing temp

394
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:21,470
work, doing data entry, environmental agencies, or
stocking warehouses. You learn to say yes to

395
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:28,269
everything. It's the idea that whenever
opportunity arises, you seize it. I feel very

396
00:39:28,269 --> 00:39:32,549
fortunate that, in recent years, because of all
the hard work and because of shows like Critical

397
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:37,353
Role that have had a lot of more opportunities
arise. I probably said yes to a lot of things I

398
00:39:37,434 --> 00:39:41,584
shouldn't have. And in doing so, it's consumed
most of my free time and it's driving me a little

399
00:39:41,584 --> 00:39:50,746
crazy. But I'm learning that balance. Both me and
Marisha are each other's support in both of our

400
00:39:50,746 --> 00:39:55,087
lives getting a little crazy and trying to make
sure we allow time for self-care and spending time

401
00:39:55,087 --> 00:40:00,216
together and carving out time for the people that
are closest to us. Part of the reason Critical

402
00:40:00,216 --> 00:40:03,704
Role is so important to us, it isn't just the
show, but honestly, it's a chance every week for

403
00:40:03,704 --> 00:40:07,936
us to get to hang out with some of our favorite
people that we don't have the time to most of the

404
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:15,673
other days of the week. Or month. So it's still
something I'm working on. I have a lot of projects

405
00:40:15,673 --> 00:40:21,033
on my plate right now. Finishing the campaign
guide's going to be a big weight off my chest.

406
00:40:21,033 --> 00:40:26,384
We're in the final throes of it right now. I'm
really excited for you; I hope you guys like it.

407
00:40:26,384 --> 00:40:33,777
But I'm learning that process now. I'm notoriously
work myself to death. I tend to take on too much

408
00:40:33,777 --> 00:40:37,184
and try to get it done, and it's not the
healthiest thing, so I'm working on it. So my

409
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:41,314
answer is, "I don't know." I'm still trying. I'll
let you know in a year if I figure out the secret.

410
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:49,294
Otherwise, I don't know.

411
00:40:49,294 --> 00:40:53,753
PertLikeTheFruit asks, "Is there some type of NPC
in particular you've been itching to introduce,

412
00:40:53,753 --> 00:40:57,635
but the moment never presented itself?" Yeah,
there's a few NPCs that I've created that never

413
00:40:57,635 --> 00:41:03,704
had a chance to show up. But I'm not going to tell
you because any NPC that doesn't get a chance--

414
00:41:03,704 --> 00:41:08,034
and any DM or GM will tell you this-- an NPC that
you like that doesn't have the opportunity to

415
00:41:08,034 --> 00:41:15,584
shine or show up goes back in the toolbox for
later. So they'll come back eventually, I'm sure.

416
00:41:15,584 --> 00:41:23,084
They'll come back. They'll come back. Trust me.

417
00:41:23,084 --> 00:41:28,932
TorchBaricane asks, "What's my favorite type of
cookie?" That would be gingersnap. Gingersnaps are

418
00:41:28,932 --> 00:41:32,216
awesome because they're not loaded down with too
much sweetness, but it's got the right amount of

419
00:41:32,216 --> 00:41:37,575
cinnamon spice. I like things that are sweet and
spicy. So gingersnaps are pretty great. Yeah, I'll

420
00:41:37,575 --> 00:41:40,374
go with that.

421
00:41:40,374 --> 00:41:43,704
Let's go with the next NPC choice, since we got
that locked in now. We did a couple questions

422
00:41:43,704 --> 00:41:50,315
there. This is so delightfully chaotic! I
apologize, but thank you for sticking with me on

423
00:41:50,315 --> 00:42:03,606
this. What is the answer? Bring Tary home. Oh,
man. This is going to be fun. Cool! Got that in

424
00:42:03,606 --> 00:42:09,826
there. And the second to last thing I'm going to
ask about this NPC is they have a secret. There's

425
00:42:09,826 --> 00:42:13,675
something that this NPC is keeping a secret that
may or may not unfold in the game. We don't know,

426
00:42:13,675 --> 00:42:21,346
but you'll know. And I'll know. But what is this
NPC's secret? Go ahead and introduce into the chat

427
00:42:21,346 --> 00:42:31,157
room what your ideas are. Keep them concise, if
you can. We'll get that worked out. So put it into

428
00:42:31,157 --> 00:42:34,572
the chat room and we'll pull some out as they go.

429
00:42:34,572 --> 00:42:40,612
(laughs) Okay.

430
00:42:40,612 --> 00:42:43,367
They're a drow! That's not a very good secret.
They're not keeping it very well, unless they're

431
00:42:43,367 --> 00:42:52,557
an illusion. I mean, it's possible. Hmm.

432
00:43:01,841 --> 00:43:04,841
Hmm. There's a lot of interesting here.

433
00:43:08,538 --> 00:43:16,498
Let's try-- Okay, he's a Revenant.

434
00:43:16,498 --> 00:43:23,316
That's an interesting one. I'm trying to pick
things that might work into the next campaign. I

435
00:43:23,316 --> 00:43:26,777
don't want to pick anything that's going to wreck
it, or the storyline that I have worked out in my

436
00:43:26,777 --> 00:43:37,317
head. So I'm having to cherry-pick a little bit
for this one. Secretly a paladin. That's

437
00:43:37,317 --> 00:43:50,058
interesting; can play with that. Put ziggurat
on there. Just ziggurat.

438
00:43:57,337 --> 00:43:59,577
He's a hitman.

439
00:44:05,838 --> 00:44:21,998
Oh, man! This is so nuts! Oh, that's interesting.
He's blind. There we go. Some interesting ones

440
00:44:21,998 --> 00:44:27,089
there. Some fun little things that can be
utilized. Some of these secrets you guys put on

441
00:44:27,089 --> 00:44:30,239
there might roll into other things that were
already mentioned. We'll see how that plays out.

442
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:39,238
So reading us back, what do we have? Revenant,
secretly a paladin, ziggurat-- what was the other

443
00:44:39,238 --> 00:44:47,277
ones? Hitman. Or he's blind. Okay, so we're going
to throw that up into the chat in a moment, to get

444
00:44:47,277 --> 00:44:53,838
that straw poll going, and we'll see which one of
those wins out to be the NPC's secret. That'll be

445
00:44:53,838 --> 00:45:03,028
interesting. Blind is not exactly a secret, you
say. However, with the right magic, you <i>can</i> keep it

446
00:45:03,028 --> 00:45:14,679
a secret. I have ideas. Don't worry, I can play
with this.

447
00:45:14,735 --> 00:45:27,050
JayRedWine says, "How'd you get into Burning Man?"
About 2008 or so, I was in a bit of a rough patch.

448
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:33,582
Losing my faith in humanity and the arts in a lot
of ways. I was in a rough period. Self-esteem,

449
00:45:33,582 --> 00:45:46,549
personal stuff. And my acting coach at the time,
who, hilariously, is Taliesin's mom, Kether, she

450
00:45:46,549 --> 00:45:52,310
had been going for many years. She said, "You
would enjoy this, and you should go. This would be

451
00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:57,322
a good thing for you." And I was like, "I don't
know. I'm not into the whole hippie drug culture."

452
00:45:57,322 --> 00:46:03,034
I had my thoughts of what the event was. She's
like, "It's not like that. I mean, it <i>is</i> like

453
00:46:03,034 --> 00:46:07,970
that in some ways, but not really." "All right,
fine, I'll go." I made a lot of excuses. She

454
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:15,452
didn't let me adhere to them. Eventually, went,
and it was a lot more than I expected. It's

455
00:46:15,452 --> 00:46:22,641
certainly not for everybody. It's a harsh
environment. It's a very open culture of all walks

456
00:46:22,641 --> 00:46:29,822
of life: culture, sexualities, expressions. A lot
of people there just walk nude. A lot of art,

457
00:46:29,822 --> 00:46:33,980
hippie-dippie stuff that a lot of people probably
couldn't even deal with or would hate entirely.

458
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:39,291
But for me, it was a wonderful environment of
adults at play for a week, and I really enjoyed

459
00:46:39,291 --> 00:46:46,032
it. It became a very important part of my life. So
I go every year. It's my cleansing, my reset

460
00:46:46,032 --> 00:46:55,402
button, my creative need to return to the default
world. I've met a few Critters out there who are

461
00:46:55,402 --> 00:46:59,913
Burners, as well. They've come by. Operator is a
nice guy. If you're watching, Hello, Operator!

462
00:46:59,913 --> 00:47:05,492
Hopefully see you this year. But it's definitely
not for everybody. It's hard to get there, it's

463
00:47:05,492 --> 00:47:10,693
hard to survive out there, it's a harsh desert
made of high-alkali playa powder. Electronics die

464
00:47:10,693 --> 00:47:17,671
out there. It's hot. You have to bring everything
in to survive, and then bring it out. But if

465
00:47:17,671 --> 00:47:23,602
you're ready to make the journey there, and if you
have that artistic mindset, it can be a really

466
00:47:23,602 --> 00:47:25,402
cool experience.

467
00:47:25,402 --> 00:47:37,660
Anyway, do we have an answer on that straw poll?
Ziggurat. Okay, then. I think we have a pretty

468
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:42,447
solid background on this NPC and where they can
come into play. I'm excited about this prospect.

469
00:47:42,447 --> 00:47:48,222
The last thing we need is a name. You guys throw
out some cool names. I'll pick out things that

470
00:47:48,222 --> 00:47:53,992
reach me and we'll vote on which one we want the
NPC name to be. So go ahead and throw your

471
00:47:53,992 --> 00:48:09,452
suggestions in the chatroom for the name of this
drow baker. (laugh) No! Nope! Nope! I know you

472
00:48:09,452 --> 00:48:13,913
guys want to be funny and cute. I want to try to
make this also work within the story where it can

473
00:48:13,913 --> 00:48:17,192
be taken seriously, because certain names will not
be taken seriously if they're introduced in this

474
00:48:17,192 --> 00:48:30,332
game. And Troy is definitely one of them. We'll
start with Ruberick. That's interesting. Miklos.

475
00:48:30,332 --> 00:48:46,787
M-I-K-L-O-S. Oh, man. There's a good one that
passed by too fast. Zal...oh, man, it went by too

476
00:48:46,817 --> 00:49:00,357
fast! Curse you, chat, for being active! No, you
guys are doing great. Let's do K'ryyn.

477
00:49:00,357 --> 00:49:11,407
K-apostrophe-R-Y-Y-N. Noxtra. N-O-X-T-R-A. Is that
four? That's five? All right! So we'll go ahead

478
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:17,117
and throw those into the straw poll. And you guys
go ahead and jump in there and vote on the name.

479
00:49:17,117 --> 00:49:23,158
Then from those names, we'll pick those, and from
there, we'll have an NPC pretty much completed

480
00:49:23,158 --> 00:49:30,337
that you guys helped create that will be
introduced probably in this next arc of the game.

481
00:49:30,337 --> 00:49:39,217
So that'll be interesting. I'm excited to see what
comes out of this one. (laugh) With that, I'm

482
00:49:39,217 --> 00:49:46,935
going to go have another sip of my drink. "RIP
Troy." It's cute. It was a really funny idea,

483
00:49:46,935 --> 00:49:52,875
guys. But in the interest of wanting to keep the
narrative realistic, and because Troy's good

484
00:49:52,875 --> 00:49:56,448
friends with a lot of us, that would have made it
a little weird.

485
00:49:58,834 --> 00:50:10,961
Question from ActionGordon. "Bees. Yes or no? If
yes, how many?" Bees, yes! How many? Seven. I

486
00:50:10,961 --> 00:50:18,555
think bees are awesome. Bees are great. They're
necessary. We have a lot of bees in our backyard.

487
00:50:18,555 --> 00:50:22,505
They're cute. They land on me sometimes. People
get freaked out by bees. That's fine. I mean honey

488
00:50:22,505 --> 00:50:29,867
bees. Fuck hornets! And yellow jackets. I hate
them. But bees are cool.

489
00:50:32,684 --> 00:50:37,595
Question from Leddle526, "Have you ever had a
moment where you almost gave up being a DM

490
00:50:37,595 --> 00:50:49,533
entirely?" Giving up DM entirely? Giving up on a
campaign, almost. Actually, the start of the

491
00:50:49,533 --> 00:50:58,825
campaign I did before this one with my buddy, Zach
Hanks, we were both co-DMing this one. And we had

492
00:50:58,825 --> 00:51:03,303
a number of friends in there: Louie, our buddy
Brian, who <i>looked</i> like a dwarf and played a

493
00:51:03,303 --> 00:51:07,998
dwarf, and Chloe Dykstra. Some of you may know
from some of her stuff. She played Saga, the

494
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:13,777
rogue. And then, Marisha came in, eventually, to
be an assassin.

495
00:51:13,777 --> 00:51:19,014
But in that campaign, the first couple sessions we
had a guy and his wife playing with us who made

496
00:51:19,014 --> 00:51:29,154
twins. He was a paladin and I think she was a
cleric. And our first two sessions, he got really

497
00:51:29,154 --> 00:51:37,458
drunk very quickly and became unruly. He became
belligerent and was interrupting everybody else,

498
00:51:37,458 --> 00:51:44,228
making sexual jokes in the middle of other
people's turns, and turned it into a him show. And

499
00:51:44,228 --> 00:51:51,530
it was not very respectful. He's a nice guy, but
once he got drunk, it was a problem. So after two

500
00:51:51,530 --> 00:51:55,277
games of that happening. And the final one, we
were in the middle of a boss battle sequence, a

501
00:51:55,277 --> 00:52:02,644
very serious moment, and he was yelling and making
stupid jokes and fart noises and talking about how

502
00:52:02,644 --> 00:52:06,301
he was going to attack with his dick, and it
wasn't even his turn. We're like, "Buddy, calm

503
00:52:06,301 --> 00:52:10,274
down." I could see his wife was embarrassed by it,
and I was like, "It's all right." Finally, during

504
00:52:10,274 --> 00:52:13,899
somebody else's turn, he jumped up and shouted
something obscene; I can't even remember. Knocked

505
00:52:13,899 --> 00:52:18,409
his beer over all over the battle map and smeared
all of the crowd. So I said, "The wall begins to

506
00:52:18,409 --> 00:52:26,287
collapse of the ceiling and unfortunately, a
portion of the cavern was in your direction as

507
00:52:26,287 --> 00:52:30,589
both of your characters are crushed as you
escape." And I killed off their characters. I

508
00:52:30,589 --> 00:52:33,473
apologized to her after, but I was like, "I don't
think this is going to fit." And she is like, "I

509
00:52:33,473 --> 00:52:42,365
understand. No worries." So he stopped playing in
the campaign. He felt bad about it, but it was for

510
00:52:42,365 --> 00:52:47,241
the best. He's a great guy now. His name's Andrew.
He's a really nice fellow. But our styles of

511
00:52:47,241 --> 00:52:49,775
gameplay didn't quite match, and that's fine.

512
00:52:49,775 --> 00:52:54,786
That's the thing, too. There's so many different
ways to play D&amp;D. Even Critical Role-- actually I

513
00:52:54,786 --> 00:52:58,199
want to talk about this a little bit. People keep
saying, "Critical Role, it's the best example

514
00:52:58,199 --> 00:53:04,360
there is for D&amp;D." It's not! It's really not. It's
<i>an</i> example of D&amp;D. It's a <i>way</i> to play the

515
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:08,763
game. It's a way that <i>we</i> play because we're
actors and as actors, we're naturally more focused

516
00:53:08,763 --> 00:53:15,300
on narrative and characterization and the drama of
the element there. Our version of D&amp;D plays more

517
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:20,671
to the story than it does the rules, per se, as
you can see some of the players haven't locked in

518
00:53:20,671 --> 00:53:24,257
all the rules sometimes. But it's because we're
more focused on other aspects of the game. And

519
00:53:24,257 --> 00:53:29,323
that's fine. We still have a good time. We're an
example of how it can play. There are elements of

520
00:53:29,323 --> 00:53:32,825
our game that you might like and take into your
home campaign, and there are a lot of people that

521
00:53:32,825 --> 00:53:35,532
watch it that, if they were to play in it, would
probably not enjoy it at all. And there are a lot

522
00:53:35,532 --> 00:53:39,046
of people--trust me, I've seen comments! I've been
tweeted! People saying like, "Your game looks like

523
00:53:39,046 --> 00:53:43,631
shit! I would never enjoy it!" And I'm like:
You're probably right! And there are games out

524
00:53:43,631 --> 00:53:46,882
there that people play that I probably wouldn't
enjoy, either. But that's what's cool about it.

525
00:53:46,882 --> 00:53:49,605
There's so many different ways to play it. There's
so many different ways you can run it for the

526
00:53:49,605 --> 00:53:53,563
players and all the styles are enjoyable for
players that are looking for that type of

527
00:53:53,563 --> 00:54:02,967
experience. So yeah, that's an example of-- Andrew
would be <i>great</i> at a table, like a Harmon-town

528
00:54:02,967 --> 00:54:08,759
type, ridiculous, drunkard debauchery table. He'd
do great there. For those of who are paying a

529
00:54:08,759 --> 00:54:12,621
little more respect to the narrative and the
intensity of a sequence, didn't quite match up

530
00:54:12,621 --> 00:54:17,764
very well. And you both respectfully talk and go,
"Guys, this isn't going to work out." And that's

531
00:54:17,764 --> 00:54:21,366
fine. So keep that in mind.

532
00:54:21,366 --> 00:54:27,589
Also, for all you guys who are new to D&amp;D, don't
expect a Critical Role experience at your table.

533
00:54:27,589 --> 00:54:30,375
Partially because, once again, we're professional
actors and we've been playing this for a long time

534
00:54:30,375 --> 00:54:33,774
before we started the stream. When we first
started playing our first few games, it was

535
00:54:33,774 --> 00:54:38,486
<i>nothing</i> like this. It was a lot of fumbling, and
"What do I do?" They were all just learning how to

536
00:54:38,486 --> 00:54:45,342
play. And some games are a little more rules
heavy. The gamers and the DM are more involved in

537
00:54:45,342 --> 00:54:49,563
the actual game aspect of it, and that's rad! I've
had a lot of sessions like that before; they've

538
00:54:49,563 --> 00:54:53,637
been a lot of fun, too. But you want to make sure
you establish those boundaries and adjust your

539
00:54:53,637 --> 00:54:58,530
expectations. Every game table is going to be
different. Every experience you have at the table

540
00:54:58,530 --> 00:55:03,948
is going to be different from what you've seen in
my, or the Roleplay Guys, or Acquisitions, Inc.,

541
00:55:03,948 --> 00:55:07,698
or High Rollers, or any other great show. All of
them are different and unique because that's how

542
00:55:07,698 --> 00:55:12,347
every table experience is playing D&amp;D. That's part
of what makes it so special. So I ask you guys,

543
00:55:12,347 --> 00:55:18,913
don't get angry if your first or second D&amp;D game
isn't like Critical Role because it can't be. Nor

544
00:55:18,913 --> 00:55:24,457
could our game ever be like yours. They're wholly
unique in their own right. So abandon expectation,

545
00:55:24,457 --> 00:55:30,103
which, by the way, is a great term, a great guide
for life, in general. Abandon expectation. Try and

546
00:55:30,103 --> 00:55:38,199
move forward and do your best. And that goes for
your D&amp;D game, as well. So I recommend that.

547
00:55:38,199 --> 00:55:51,316
Anyway, do we have a name? Answer on this one?
K-apostrophe-R-Y-Y-N. So K'ryyn, the drow baker.

548
00:55:51,316 --> 00:55:57,945
K'ryyn, the drow baker whose interest is involving
bringing Tary home, and they have a secret that

549
00:55:57,945 --> 00:56:05,573
involves a ziggurat of some kind. (evil laugh)
Good to know.

550
00:56:05,573 --> 00:56:09,641
StarryBright brings up a question, "What do I
think about the McElroy boys and the show,

551
00:56:09,641 --> 00:56:13,248
Adventure Zone?" They're phenomenal! It's a great
show. If you haven't had a chance to see it, the

552
00:56:13,248 --> 00:56:21,561
podcast, The Adventure Zone, it's great! They run
a D&amp;D game there. I would say it's a less serious

553
00:56:21,561 --> 00:56:24,344
tone than Critical Role, but they have serious
moments, as well. They have a lot of dramatic

554
00:56:24,344 --> 00:56:29,822
moments. It's a podcast form. It's a lot less
rules heavy than ours, which ours is not as rules

555
00:56:29,822 --> 00:56:34,184
heavy as some other games. So like I said, it's a
spectrum. But The Adventure Zone's great. The

556
00:56:34,184 --> 00:56:38,944
McElroys are fantastic. Travis is fantastic. We've
talked a bit online and I'm a big fan of what they

557
00:56:38,944 --> 00:56:44,330
do. So if you haven't had the opportunity, check
it out. I recommend it. They're fantastic. And

558
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:49,327
they also do a great job of representing the
importance of community and support others in the

559
00:56:49,327 --> 00:56:56,203
community. They're generally rad people. So highly
recommend you check it out, too.

560
00:56:56,203 --> 00:57:03,219
Let's pick another question here. I'd be curious
to see some non-D&amp;D related, non-voice over. I

561
00:57:03,219 --> 00:57:08,423
want to make this part of a conversation of just
random shit, also, because I answer a lot of

562
00:57:08,423 --> 00:57:12,378
questions on panels and stuff. So if you have any
burning questions about silly things or life

563
00:57:12,378 --> 00:57:17,553
things, we can get real. I'm all for that. If you
want to make this almost a hearken back to the

564
00:57:17,553 --> 00:57:24,161
honesty hours days of the early Twitch stream, I'm
totally fine with that. So be okay with going into

565
00:57:24,161 --> 00:57:27,236
that regard.

566
00:57:27,236 --> 00:57:30,023
"Did you talk with any of the Critical Role guests
about how they spent the year time skip?" from

567
00:57:30,023 --> 00:57:33,132
ScottyKnows. Yes, I did. We actually met last
night for about four or five hours going over all

568
00:57:33,132 --> 00:57:39,983
that. So that'll be coming up soon. So look
forward to that.

569
00:57:39,983 --> 00:57:45,769
Oh, wow, it's all exploding! I saw someone ask,
"Triss or Yennefer?" I was a Triss girl until

570
00:57:45,769 --> 00:57:50,601
Witcher 3, and then I began to lean Yennefer a
little bit. But I went back to Triss. I'm a Triss

571
00:57:50,601 --> 00:57:56,214
person through and through now, I think. I mean,
I'm marrying a redhead, so I feel like I'm a

572
00:57:56,214 --> 00:58:04,524
little biased. Yennefer was a love that was built
by magical force that eventually blossomed into an

573
00:58:04,524 --> 00:58:08,753
actual attraction if you play it right. Triss, I
felt, was a genuine attraction that came

574
00:58:08,753 --> 00:58:13,178
naturally. So that, to me, was something very
important. So I think I'm a Triss guy, to answer

575
00:58:13,178 --> 00:58:20,390
that. I <i>once</i> said Yennefer, but that's changed
since then. As some things do.

576
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:38,955
HughMillerC asks, "How do you want to do this?"
With alcohol. CalRanig asks, "Can we see more

577
00:58:38,955 --> 00:58:46,285
dwarves? Love their accent." I'd love that. I love
the brogue. It's my favorite. The Scots style is

578
00:58:46,285 --> 00:58:51,625
one of my favorite ones to do. I enjoy it
thoroughly across the spectrum of even soft Scots,

579
00:58:51,625 --> 00:58:57,813
which is more of the casual conversational type. I
love that. It's got a nice almost poetic lilt to

580
00:58:57,813 --> 00:59:03,255
it. I love speaking in it, I love hearing it. I
love it; it's my favorite way of doing it. Usually

581
00:59:03,255 --> 00:59:09,467
when you think about dwarf, you think more classic
video game style and World of Warcraft. "Aye, well

582
00:59:09,467 --> 00:59:13,246
bring me to the orcs!" But for me, the softer Scot
is more nice, too. The more refined and more

583
00:59:13,246 --> 00:59:18,223
conversational type. I love it! So I would like to
do that more, but only if dwarves work in the

584
00:59:18,223 --> 00:59:25,312
story. And they are a threat in many
circumstances.

585
00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:30,338
"Favorite animated movie?" I saw that go by real
fast. Aw, man! Does Who Framed Roger Rabbit count?

586
00:59:30,338 --> 00:59:33,921
It's half-animated. I'm going to say it works
because it's one of my favorite movies of all

587
00:59:33,921 --> 00:59:39,031
time. And not only is it a technical achievement
and a narrative achievement, but such an amazing

588
00:59:39,031 --> 00:59:43,940
cast. One of the last big projects that Mel Blanc
got to work on and actually do his Warner Brothers

589
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:52,659
characters. It's a perfect film in so many ways. I
love Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and it should, and

590
00:59:52,659 --> 00:59:57,529
will, never get remade because it's one of those
films that only worked in that era and could never

591
00:59:57,529 --> 01:00:02,252
be made again. So that's definitely it.

592
01:00:02,252 --> 01:00:06,935
Someone asked about having another person become a
permanent member of Vox Machina or the campaign.

593
01:00:06,935 --> 01:00:14,581
I'm going to say no to that. I mean, seven players
is already a lot. When Ashley's not here, even six

594
01:00:14,581 --> 01:00:20,716
is a lot, so I think we're good. We're solid with
this number. Six to seven players is good, and

595
01:00:20,716 --> 01:00:23,357
that gives us enough room to occasionally have a
guest, but I feel like stretching the attention a

596
01:00:23,357 --> 01:00:28,755
bit. And I do want to have guests on occasionally,
to add their narrative and to mix it up a little

597
01:00:28,755 --> 01:00:34,503
bit, but I don't think we're going to bring
another permanent member on, in my opinion. It's a

598
01:00:34,503 --> 01:00:39,580
lot to concentrate on, and I'm already stretched
thin as it is. Thank you for understanding.

599
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:50,160
Have I ever been charged with a crime? No. I've
been interrogated by police. This is a funny

600
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:55,360
story. Back in high school, I was walking to my
friend Todd Hunt's house to go play Rifts. I had

601
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:59,498
my Rifts character, my binder, my dice and
everything in a bag. He lived not that far from my

602
01:00:59,498 --> 01:01:04,432
girlfriend of the time, Mira. I would, on the way,
walking to his house, I was going to stop by and

603
01:01:04,432 --> 01:01:11,257
say hi, but she wasn't home apparently. I walked
up, rang the doorbell, nobody there. I looked at

604
01:01:11,257 --> 01:01:13,942
the window to see if anybody was home. Went up and
looked at her bedroom window. Wasn't home, so I

605
01:01:13,942 --> 01:01:17,477
continued walking over to my friend Todd's place.
About five, ten minutes later, a bunch of cop cars

606
01:01:17,477 --> 01:01:22,955
pulled up because apparently the cops were really
bored in Agoura Hills. They stopped me and they

607
01:01:22,955 --> 01:01:28,765
were like, hey, so what's going on? What are you
wandering in this neighborhood for? I'm like, I'm

608
01:01:28,765 --> 01:01:32,361
just going to visit my girlfriend, but she wasn't
home, so I'm going to go to my friend Todd. Oh,

609
01:01:32,361 --> 01:01:43,952
really? What's in the bag? I'm like, my Lord Magus
OC, why? So I hand them my character binder and my

610
01:01:43,952 --> 01:01:45,602
dice.

611
01:01:45,602 --> 01:01:48,991
Apparently, I guess, they got a call that there
was a prowler with a bag of tools lurking around

612
01:01:48,991 --> 01:01:53,262
the house. One of the paranoid neighbors. But I
had the experience of them interrogating me over

613
01:01:53,262 --> 01:01:56,332
my character sheet and asking if there were any
drugs on my dice, and like, smelling and licking

614
01:01:56,332 --> 01:02:02,132
them. I was like, come on, guys. Really? Okay,
we're good? We good? He's like, yeah, okay. Go

615
01:02:02,132 --> 01:02:06,992
ahead. Thank you! I grab my bag and I start
walking on to my friend Todd's house. He's like, I

616
01:02:06,992 --> 01:02:12,661
thought you were visiting the girlfriend? It's up
the road, right? I'm like, well, I mean, no one

617
01:02:12,661 --> 01:02:18,752
was home, so-- I'm a terrible, I get nervous
anyway, so he's like, huh. Well, if that's true,

618
01:02:18,752 --> 01:02:22,267
I'll drive you. I'll drive you to go see your
girlfriend. I'm like, uh! And I got really freaked

619
01:02:22,267 --> 01:02:30,102
out because my girlfriend's mom hated me at the
time, because I wasn't a doctor or from the Middle

620
01:02:30,102 --> 01:02:35,202
East. She was Lebanese. So I was like, oh god, the
last thing I want is to have the police show up at

621
01:02:35,202 --> 01:02:42,117
the door with me and her mom's there. It would be
terrible. Thankfully, she wasn't, and the cop

622
01:02:42,117 --> 01:02:47,020
didn't really do it, and everything was fine, but
that was my really nervous run-in with the police

623
01:02:47,020 --> 01:02:53,915
with my Rifts game character. There you go. Little
story for you to take home. Ah, boy.

624
01:02:53,915 --> 01:02:57,596
Question. Am I going to Dragoncon this year? No,
and I don't know if I'll ever be to Dragoncon

625
01:02:57,596 --> 01:03:00,719
again because unfortunately it happens at the same
time as Burning Man every year. I went back in

626
01:03:00,719 --> 01:03:07,609
2004 and 2005, where I cosplayed as Dan Hibiki and
Mugatu from the first Zoolander, because that's

627
01:03:07,609 --> 01:03:11,468
what you do when you're at Dragoncon. Had a great
time, but since Burning Man becomes a little more

628
01:03:11,468 --> 01:03:17,735
of a creative and spiritual retreat for me every
year, that takes precedence. So I don't know if

629
01:03:17,735 --> 01:03:19,524
we'll ever get back unless they change the
weekend. But it's a lot of fun! I have a lot of

630
01:03:19,524 --> 01:03:23,551
friends that go, so have a good time.

631
01:03:23,551 --> 01:03:31,427
What's our little question? Nebuchadnezzar asks,
"What's the story behind each of your bracelets?"

632
01:03:31,427 --> 01:03:34,671
This is interesting. I know people, I've seen
people make fun of the fact that I wear these

633
01:03:34,671 --> 01:03:38,583
leather bracelets, and it's a fashion statement,
and it seems so douchey and rockstar-like to wear

634
01:03:38,583 --> 01:03:45,606
and fair play. This was the first one I got, right
here. This was a magnet-based bracelet and I

635
01:03:45,606 --> 01:03:52,092
received this actually at my first Burning Man.
This, to me, represents personal responsibility

636
01:03:52,092 --> 01:04:01,272
and knowing where I come from. I come from a
bloodline of alcoholics. My father also dealt with

637
01:04:01,272 --> 01:04:07,832
drug addiction. He was a musician in the 70s and
80s, he went to Narcotics Anonymous for a while--

638
01:04:07,832 --> 01:04:13,990
I'm opening up here. Wonderful man, I love him to
death. He was, and is, such a wonderful person.

639
01:04:13,990 --> 01:04:19,177
But he dealt with addiction issues, and so,
knowing I was predisposed to all of this, I

640
01:04:19,177 --> 01:04:25,213
avoided alcohol. I avoided anything. I didn't even
have my first drink until I was 23. I was so

641
01:04:25,213 --> 01:04:33,468
scared that I was predisposed. As I began to know
myself better as a person in my life, I decided, I

642
01:04:33,468 --> 01:04:39,223
felt that I wasn't possibly held by the same
demons that my family before me did.

643
01:04:39,223 --> 01:04:46,933
So I tried alcohol and was like, okay, yeah, this
might be socially a thing, but it's not for me.

644
01:04:46,933 --> 01:04:50,084
And so I'd occasionally have a drink socially, but
it wasn't a big thing. I felt that was a big thing

645
01:04:50,084 --> 01:04:55,199
for me. Then, my first Burning Man, being
surrounded by drug culture and having a lot of my

646
01:04:55,199 --> 01:05:00,508
judgments on various experiences that I had
friends who had and talked about, and I was like,

647
01:05:00,508 --> 01:05:07,113
eh, no no no-- that was my time to actually face
those demons as well. And so I had a number of

648
01:05:07,113 --> 01:05:10,739
experiences at the burn that year with friends, in
a safe environment, where I could try different

649
01:05:10,739 --> 01:05:20,076
things, safe things. But so I could speak with
these, from a basis of understanding, safe

650
01:05:20,076 --> 01:05:25,903
hallucinogens and things like that in a very nice
environment. The end of that week, I realized that

651
01:05:25,903 --> 01:05:33,515
I really firmly understood that I was not bound by
the same demons of addiction that my father did,

652
01:05:33,515 --> 01:05:39,581
and my grandfather before him. I met a random
person on my last day that week and we met at the

653
01:05:39,581 --> 01:05:43,644
edge of the trash fence, far out into the desert.
We talked for two hours and I told him all about

654
01:05:43,644 --> 01:05:48,882
this history, and they gave me this bracelet as a
reminder that I overcame my family's demons, and

655
01:05:48,882 --> 01:05:55,088
as a reminder of the responsibility that I have to
make sure that I stay true to myself and try and

656
01:05:55,088 --> 01:05:59,028
help others to not befall those same traps. So
that was where I got my first bracelet, and I wear

657
01:05:59,028 --> 01:06:02,038
it all the time.

658
01:06:02,038 --> 01:06:07,929
The second one I got because Marisha made it for
me on our first anniversary. She bought the

659
01:06:07,929 --> 01:06:14,052
leather, she dyed it herself, she punched it and
if you see, in there a little bit, you can see

660
01:06:14,052 --> 01:06:21,170
coordinates that she pushed into the leather.
These coordinates are the coordinates on the earth

661
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:25,987
where we had our first kiss. This was a beach on
PCH, under the moonlight, because we've got to be

662
01:06:25,987 --> 01:06:31,247
cheesy and romantic and shit. But she gave that to
me as a reminder of that night, and so this

663
01:06:31,247 --> 01:06:35,292
bracelet, to me, is a reminder of her. And so I
keep that with me at all times.

664
01:06:35,292 --> 01:06:38,505
This one was given to me by my best friend,
Brittany Walloch, who I've known for over ten

665
01:06:38,505 --> 01:06:45,107
years. She's been a dear friend, confidante, and
helped me get through a lot of hard times and been

666
01:06:45,107 --> 01:06:52,805
there for me. I know, it's fucking cheesy, but you
asked, guys. Sorry. So this, to me, represents the

667
01:06:52,805 --> 01:06:57,133
friends and the people that I have to support me
and help me through the hard times, and are

668
01:06:57,133 --> 01:07:05,835
understanding when I get busy or get sad, and so
this one represents friendship to me.

669
01:07:05,835 --> 01:07:10,869
This one here was a gift from a Critter, during
one of the Critmases. Little Tree of Life on

670
01:07:10,869 --> 01:07:16,516
there, if you get a chance to see. This was
important to me because this represents you guys,

671
01:07:16,516 --> 01:07:20,677
this represents the community. Represents everyone
who has come along with us on these adventures,

672
01:07:20,677 --> 01:07:27,260
the Critical Role, and how you changed my life in
so many wonderful ways. So this, I wear this all

673
01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:32,120
the time because it reminds me of you guys and
what we're doing in all this crazy silliness. So

674
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:37,318
now you have the story behind my wrist bands.
Probably the deepest explanation of them I've

675
01:07:37,318 --> 01:07:39,787
given to date. I may have said too much about
myself, but whatever, that's what this afternoon's

676
01:07:39,787 --> 01:07:42,942
about. There you go.

677
01:07:44,881 --> 01:07:51,772
All right. The question, how did you and Marisha
meet? I'll try to make this a lot quicker than the

678
01:07:51,772 --> 01:07:57,661
last story. Me and Marisha met through a mutual
friend, Becky Young, who was an actress friend of

679
01:07:57,661 --> 01:08:05,103
mine. She played Samus in my web series I did back
in 2008-2009, called There Will Be Brawl. If you

680
01:08:05,103 --> 01:08:10,359
haven't seen it, it's silly live-action film noir
crime drama of the Smash Bros universe. She was

681
01:08:10,359 --> 01:08:14,369
doing improv and in one of her improv classes,
Marisha had just started doing improv. So they

682
01:08:14,369 --> 01:08:19,650
became close friends and began doing scene work
and sketches together. Then Becky was going to

683
01:08:19,650 --> 01:08:27,416
create a geeky sketch group for the internet. She
called in a bunch of her friends to be writers and

684
01:08:27,416 --> 01:08:31,655
actors on it. She called me in, Matt Key, and a
few friends that she met through Brawl, then

685
01:08:31,655 --> 01:08:34,724
brought Marisha over from her improv.

686
01:08:34,724 --> 01:08:38,582
So we met at that first writing meeting and we
both immediately crushed on each other, but we

687
01:08:38,582 --> 01:08:44,963
were both in other relationships and like, "Nice
to meet you!" That was, you know, we became loose

688
01:08:44,963 --> 01:08:52,314
friends. Met at a couple social events over the
next year or so, but we, you know, we were this

689
01:08:52,314 --> 01:08:57,424
distant, aw, if only, but alas. Then about a year
after that, we reconnected after not seeing each

690
01:08:57,424 --> 01:09:05,902
other for a while. I'll get to the tattoo in a
minute. I had gone in for a mo-cap audition and

691
01:09:05,902 --> 01:09:09,153
they wanted to know if I knew any females who had
dance experience, martial arts experience. I was

692
01:09:09,153 --> 01:09:13,612
like, Marisha does! So I got her an audition there
and she called me to say thank you. Can I pay you

693
01:09:13,612 --> 01:09:17,323
back with a drink some time? I'd love to! We never
actually had a chance to hang out one-on-one

694
01:09:17,323 --> 01:09:24,600
before! So we went and got a drink and talked,
four and a half hours, and we clicked. It was an

695
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:30,782
electric dinner. Everything was perfect. I was
like, oh my god, this is amazing. I had been out

696
01:09:30,782 --> 01:09:35,255
of my last relationship for about nine, ten months
at this time, and spent a period of time being

697
01:09:35,255 --> 01:09:39,161
single. Tried the dating thing and it was weird,
didn't like it, and I was spending a lot of time

698
01:09:39,161 --> 01:09:44,157
being solitary. She was on the outskirts of a
long-term relationship that had been dead in the

699
01:09:44,157 --> 01:09:48,232
water for about six months, according to her. So
we went our own ways. About a week later she

700
01:09:48,232 --> 01:09:52,139
called me and was like, hey, I just broke up with
my boyfriend. Do you want to get a drink? I need

701
01:09:52,139 --> 01:09:57,652
to talk to somebody. I'm like, sure. So we went
out and got drinks again. From there, we began to

702
01:09:57,652 --> 01:10:02,455
hang out more, and it eventually turned into a
romance and the rest is history. Now we're getting

703
01:10:02,455 --> 01:10:07,899
married in October, which is crazy.

704
01:10:07,899 --> 01:10:16,288
Anyway. Tattoo. So this is my first tattoo, right
there. This represents the art car of our Burning

705
01:10:16,288 --> 01:10:26,163
Man camp, the Sensitron 5000. It's a triangular
metallic platform built on a truck bed that has a

706
01:10:26,163 --> 01:10:33,933
large LED umbrella that comes off the top of it.
It's hard to describe. If you do a search for

707
01:10:33,933 --> 01:10:37,550
"Sensitron 5000 Burning Man" you might see a
picture of it. There's these big colored silks

708
01:10:37,550 --> 01:10:44,524
that hang off of it. But anyway, this tattoo is a
geometric drawing of the art car and it's a little

709
01:10:44,524 --> 01:10:51,397
reminder of that little part of Burning Man home
and a place where me and Marisha have had many

710
01:10:51,397 --> 01:10:58,734
great times together with a good camp family out
there. So that's what the tattoo means.

711
01:10:58,734 --> 01:11:08,936
Now let's start getting onto the creature. Let's
do some fun stuff here. So for the creature, for

712
01:11:08,936 --> 01:11:14,167
the encounter. Who has more shoes, me or Marisha?
Marisha. I own like two pairs of shoes. And

713
01:11:14,167 --> 01:11:18,604
they're both busted. Actually one's a little
better, I replaced it not too long ago. But I'm

714
01:11:18,604 --> 01:11:27,673
not a clothing shoe person. These are the fanciest
socks I own. Okay, so. For the monster encounter,

715
01:11:27,673 --> 01:11:33,989
for the first bit here I want to ask: this
creature, what size do we want this creature to

716
01:11:33,989 --> 01:11:40,232
be? I'll throw the ones out, you guys don't have
to put things in there because it's a limited

717
01:11:40,232 --> 01:11:46,033
course here. I'll go with tiny, because what would
be greater than a really powerful, super tiny boss

718
01:11:46,033 --> 01:12:04,167
fight? Medium, large, gargantuan, and small. So
tiny, small, medium, large, and gargantuan? I

719
01:12:04,167 --> 01:12:13,445
think that's all. No, huge. I missed huge. So
we'll do tiny, medium, large, huge, and

720
01:12:13,445 --> 01:12:18,651
gargantuan. I don't think we need to worry about
small because if we're going to go tiny, go tiny,

721
01:12:18,651 --> 01:12:26,545
right? So those are the five. Tiny, medium, large,
huge, gargantuan. We'll throw that in the straw

722
01:12:26,545 --> 01:12:31,697
poll and we'll see where that one ends up soon.

723
01:12:31,697 --> 01:12:46,133
Now getting back to the questions here. Martyr85
asks, "When you get a rare chance to play, is

724
01:12:46,133 --> 01:12:53,363
there a personality trait you have that you
purposely try to avoid while roleplaying?" I try

725
01:12:53,363 --> 01:13:00,048
to avoid the Batman persona. Kind of like, "I'm
dark and broody, and I know everything and I'm

726
01:13:00,048 --> 01:13:06,662
badass. And whenever anything story or emotional
happens, I don't care." I don't want to play

727
01:13:06,662 --> 01:13:11,371
Drizzt Do'Urden, basically. I've played with so
many players over the years that all fall into

728
01:13:11,371 --> 01:13:16,843
that archetype. Don't get me wrong, I love Drizzt
as a character, but that set up a precedent in the

729
01:13:16,843 --> 01:13:26,738
late '90s and early 2000s that most guy gamers I
gamed with tended to lean in that Bruce Willis,

730
01:13:26,738 --> 01:13:32,091
action-movie-star-type persona. That got a little
ridiculous for a while. So I try and make things a

731
01:13:32,091 --> 01:13:37,492
little more kooky. I do try and make my characters
after the rest of the party has, so I can fill in

732
01:13:37,492 --> 01:13:42,700
the gap. I'm a support player, I guess, in that
regard. So I'll wait for everyone else to choose

733
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:46,250
what they want and I'll see what's missing, and
then I'll go ahead and create something to fill

734
01:13:46,250 --> 01:13:49,946
that space. That's generally how I do it. And I
recommend you do it too! It might force you into

735
01:13:49,946 --> 01:13:52,216
some uncomfortable territory, you might end up
playing a class that you normally wouldn't have

736
01:13:52,216 --> 01:13:55,764
chosen, but realize, that was actually pretty fun.
And a lot cooler than I thought it would be. You

737
01:13:55,764 --> 01:13:58,994
can learn a lot that way, just saying.

738
01:14:00,026 --> 01:14:06,126
Whatever happened to the aasimar kids? We'll find
out. Still in Whitestone, from what you guys know.

739
01:14:06,126 --> 01:14:10,668
Which, by the way, there's a lot of NPCs. Lot of
NPCs in this world. I can't show them all, all the

740
01:14:10,668 --> 01:14:17,348
time. When they become relevant they'll arrive, or
if the party searches for them, they'll be there,

741
01:14:17,348 --> 01:14:22,722
maybe. But there's a lot of characters that I put
in this world as I realized over time and it's

742
01:14:22,722 --> 01:14:27,396
getting a little nuts. So sorry if one of your
favorites hasn't showed up in a while. It's a big

743
01:14:27,396 --> 01:14:33,488
world. Vox Machina can only cover so much ground
at any given point in time. Sorry.

744
01:14:33,488 --> 01:14:39,156
Actually, do we have an answer on that one?

745
01:14:39,156 --> 01:14:41,868
[offscreen] Tiny. Almost 99 percent.

746
01:14:41,868 --> 01:14:47,299
Almost 99 percent tiny?! I love you guys so much.
I'm so excited for an extremely powerful, tiny

747
01:14:47,299 --> 01:14:55,347
beast. I'm so excited for this. Oh my god. Oh, I
was hoping you were going to say that. Okay, so.

748
01:14:55,347 --> 01:15:00,172
Tiny creature. Now, type. Creature type. I'm going
to have you guys throw some in the chat room.

749
01:15:00,172 --> 01:15:08,661
These include undead, monstrous, beast,
aberration, construct, any of the classic Monster

750
01:15:08,661 --> 01:15:13,159
Manual creature types. Start throwing them into
chat and I'll start pulling out the ones that seem

751
01:15:13,159 --> 01:15:17,057
to get more votes as we go.

752
01:15:17,057 --> 01:15:30,155
Yeah, fiends is one. Pixies, fey. We'll throw fey
on there, fey seems to have gotten a few votes.

753
01:15:30,155 --> 01:15:38,026
Aberration's getting a bunch of votes as well.
Construct's getting a lot of votes. So we've got

754
01:15:38,026 --> 01:15:56,896
fey, aberration, construct. Oh man, a lot of that.
Celestial, I'm seeing celestial a lot in there.

755
01:15:56,896 --> 01:16:13,082
And we'll say... elemental. There we go. Those are
some five interesting choices. Those are the ones

756
01:16:13,082 --> 01:16:21,987
I've seen the most, at least. So there we go. We
have fey, we have construct, we have elemental, we

757
01:16:21,987 --> 01:16:27,823
have aberration, and-- what was the last one?
Celestial. There we go. So we'll get that straw

758
01:16:27,823 --> 01:16:32,424
poll going and we'll figure out what that is here
in a moment. I'm going to go ahead and pour a

759
01:16:32,424 --> 01:16:42,172
little port in here. Oh, look at that fine fire.
That totally real fire. It's real, don't judge me.

760
01:16:42,172 --> 01:16:50,724
I have not had a drink on a Tuesday this early. At
least not a while, that wasn't a margarita. Okay.

761
01:16:50,724 --> 01:16:57,194
So IAmVirus asks, "Skyrim or Witcher 3?" Witcher
3. I love me some Elder Scrolls, I've played them

762
01:16:57,194 --> 01:17:05,476
all since Arena. But Witcher 3 all the way, I'm
sayin'. Deslog asks: "Question. Wine, whiskey, or

763
01:17:05,476 --> 01:17:12,958
vodka?" I would have said vodka years ago, but
I've come to enjoy whiskey more in recent years.

764
01:17:12,958 --> 01:17:18,505
That happens when your girlfriend's from Kentucky.
She brings bourbon into your life. But even then,

765
01:17:18,505 --> 01:17:25,508
I'm not a heavy drinker so it'll be like one
drink, it'd probably be whiskey. Probably mixed

766
01:17:25,508 --> 01:17:31,288
with something. I'm a girly drinker, I want sweet
shit. I can enjoy a nice straight, harsh liquor as

767
01:17:31,288 --> 01:17:37,561
a sipping drink, but give me a mojito. Give me a
margarita. Give me something nice and fruity and

768
01:17:37,561 --> 01:17:43,899
sweet. I'll deal with the headache, it'll be fine.

769
01:17:43,899 --> 01:17:51,329
ZZZ195 asks, "How do you deal with rejection?" Oh
man. Not well at first. I remember when I was in

770
01:17:51,329 --> 01:17:57,389
seventh grade--because I got rejected a lot--I had
a very interesting upbringing. Or at least a very

771
01:17:57,389 --> 01:18:04,119
interesting childhood. I had a lot of asking girls
out whenever I got the courage, and them saying

772
01:18:04,119 --> 01:18:09,802
"yes" on the spot and the next day going,
"Actually, no." And that sucked. I had a P.E.

773
01:18:09,802 --> 01:18:13,886
teacher named Mr. Pickett who-- I just wouldn't
get up and run the mile in seventh grade after a

774
01:18:13,886 --> 01:18:22,357
girl turned me down. A girl named-- I think it was
Jamie, in choir. Chorus. And he was like, "Is it a

775
01:18:22,357 --> 01:18:27,069
girl?" I'm like, "Yeah." He goes, "It's okay, man.
Women are fickle." Which is a douchey thing to say

776
01:18:31,198 --> 01:18:31,839
now in hindsight, but at the time it helped.
Pulled me out of my funk. And he gave me a

777
01:18:31,839 --> 01:18:35,693
dude-to-dude girl talk and I was like, "Oh, I feel
better." Rejection sucks, no matter what happens.

778
01:18:36,062 --> 01:18:42,652
But you have to remember, rejection is not because
you are a lesser person. Much like an audition,

779
01:18:42,652 --> 01:18:48,710
you just weren't the right person. Don't take a
rejection, if it's from an individual you're

780
01:18:48,710 --> 01:18:52,331
asking out, as an offense or that they don't want
to have anything to do with you. Sometimes it's

781
01:18:52,331 --> 01:18:57,478
just, "You're not what I'm looking for. I don't
know you well enough." And some great friendships

782
01:18:57,478 --> 01:19:02,979
I've seen come out of rejection from multiple
sides. But there is a habit I've seen, and a lot

783
01:19:02,979 --> 01:19:08,895
of this "nice guy" syndrome happen online where
it's like, "I will be a friend to a girl and the

784
01:19:08,895 --> 01:19:14,157
minute that I begin to ask her out and she says
'No,' then I'm like 'fuck her!'" and it's an

785
01:19:14,157 --> 01:19:20,438
unhealthy behavior. Because you're missing
opportunities for great friendship, and two, she

786
01:19:20,438 --> 01:19:25,409
just wasn't into that aspect, at least not now.
Give her time to get to know you better or let it

787
01:19:25,409 --> 01:19:29,380
blossom into a friendship and focus on somebody
else who might be more your style. As far as

788
01:19:29,380 --> 01:19:38,728
career rejection-- keep focused on the next
venture. The more you obsess and concentrate on

789
01:19:38,728 --> 01:19:51,471
any sort of rejection or falling out of a
prospective path, it's hard, but if you focus on

790
01:19:51,471 --> 01:19:55,406
the next endeavor and try and be like, "Okay, that
didn't work out. What can I focus on now?" That

791
01:19:55,406 --> 01:19:59,872
not only takes your mind off of it, but it already
gets you in a better direction, focusing on what's

792
01:19:59,872 --> 01:20:05,119
right and what could be the next venture.

793
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:09,341
Yeah. I had a lot of interesting experiences as a
kid. Actually I want to bring this up real fast,

794
01:20:09,341 --> 01:20:17,723
because I feel like it's important. I want to
apologize legitimately to anybody who felt

795
01:20:17,723 --> 01:20:26,217
uncomfortable in the story of the last Taryon
episode and the reveal there. And I apologize if

796
01:20:26,217 --> 01:20:35,322
that hit too close to home, if that was not the
representation of your story that you wanted seen,

797
01:20:35,322 --> 01:20:39,620
and I understand that it made a lot of people feel
uncomfortable and I'm sorry, I'm legitimately

798
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:47,031
sorry. I put a post about it on Twitter, but text
is easy to be misconstrued and you only have so

799
01:20:47,031 --> 01:20:54,064
much brainspace to put out there. And I'm sure
I've been torn apart on the internet, that's fine.

800
01:20:54,064 --> 01:21:00,993
I admit that. However, I do want to say that I
think it's an important story to tell from what we

801
01:21:00,993 --> 01:21:04,708
understand of it. And when I say "what we
understand of it," y'know, we all come from

802
01:21:04,708 --> 01:21:16,256
different backgrounds and-- this is going to be a
little real here for a second. We have our

803
01:21:16,256 --> 01:21:21,578
experiences to pull from when it comes to story.
We as actors, we write and we only create from

804
01:21:21,578 --> 01:21:32,334
experience. And Exandria is very much an open
environment for the most part. Sexuality is an

805
01:21:32,334 --> 01:21:42,923
open thing in society. There are couples of all
walks of life: asexual, trans, nonbinary, gay, bi,

806
01:21:42,923 --> 01:21:51,936
everything, and it's all open in the world. Is the
world free of ignorance? No. That's part of life,

807
01:21:51,936 --> 01:22:00,051
and part of the story because people are flawed,
people are stupid. It's minimized in my world

808
01:22:00,051 --> 01:22:04,373
because I like to imagine a world where it is
largely minimized, but it's not something that's

809
01:22:04,373 --> 01:22:11,139
not going to exist. And what little bit of Tary's
story we've touched on, a lot of it improvised by

810
01:22:11,139 --> 01:22:14,645
Sam on the spot, and a lot we've talked about
since then, and we developed a little bit

811
01:22:14,645 --> 01:22:19,340
beforehand to an extent, I think is an important
story to tell. And parts of it resonate. I've had

812
01:22:19,340 --> 01:22:27,463
people concerned that we were making fun of his
awakening, or his coming to terms with his venture

813
01:22:27,463 --> 01:22:32,909
in the last episode, and I can honestly say that
if it came across that way, I'm sorry. That is not

814
01:22:32,909 --> 01:22:41,363
the case. We are very, very sensitive to these
things and many of us have lived very close to, or

815
01:22:41,363 --> 01:22:48,821
dealt with homophobia on our end as well. I grew
up a very androgynous, long-haired pretty boy who

816
01:22:48,821 --> 01:22:55,044
was quiet. And god knows I spent a number of years
of my youth being called "faggot" and being pushed

817
01:22:55,044 --> 01:23:03,133
around, and I have a lot of very, very important
people in my life who have dealt with far worse

818
01:23:03,133 --> 01:23:13,360
and have undergone a lot of terrible
circumstances. And I feel for that a lot.

819
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:18,551
My Uncle Ted, for instance. One of the most
impactful people in my life, probably, at a young

820
01:23:18,551 --> 01:23:22,702
age. He was my dad's brother. He introduced me to
musical theater, he introduced me to Andrew Lloyd

821
01:23:22,702 --> 01:23:27,801
Webber's Phantom of the Opera. We used to play
piano and sing songs around the piano and stuff,

822
01:23:27,801 --> 01:23:34,461
and he's such a wonderful person. And as a kid I
loved him, he was my favorite relative on that

823
01:23:34,461 --> 01:23:40,178
side of the family. He also dealt with the
difficulty of being married and having a child

824
01:23:40,178 --> 01:23:45,598
with his wife and then one day coming to terms
with the fact that he was gay. And it sundered a

825
01:23:45,598 --> 01:23:53,542
lot of that part of the family at the time, and it
was very hard to be in parts of the family that

826
01:23:53,542 --> 01:23:59,188
didn't understand that. And even as a kid I knew
what was wrong, and what felt wrong, and what was

827
01:23:59,188 --> 01:24:13,527
being said. And you know, and then getting-- and
then I had to watch him waste away over the years

828
01:24:14,127 --> 01:24:28,173
because he caught HIV and then AIDS at a time when
it was very prominent in the late '80s and early 90s.

829
01:24:28,173 --> 01:24:36,709
And then, you know, through the '90s, in a lot of
ways was very hard for people of alternative

830
01:24:36,709 --> 01:24:39,662
sexualities because we didn't have communities. We
didn't have the internet, we didn't have tumblr,

831
01:24:39,662 --> 01:24:44,696
we didn't have Facebook. There weren't places you
could go to feel safe if your lifestyle was

832
01:24:44,696 --> 01:24:51,224
expected to be not the norm or not accepted. So I
had a lot of friends and a lot of close people

833
01:24:51,224 --> 01:24:58,483
that had to just suffer inside and had nowhere to
talk, and occasionally meet somebody or find

834
01:24:58,483 --> 01:25:01,870
somebody who was comfortable enough to be out and
proud. And then permission was given, but even

835
01:25:01,870 --> 01:25:11,220
that was met with a lot of difficulty. I'm glad we
live in a world now, by comparison, where things

836
01:25:11,220 --> 01:25:18,017
are much more respected. And it's still a fight.
God, it's still a fight. There's still so much to

837
01:25:18,017 --> 01:25:24,527
be done and it's still so much bullshit and so
much disrespect and lack of empathy for people who

838
01:25:24,527 --> 01:25:33,903
just want to be happy. And that bothers me on a
deep level and feel it really hard.

839
01:25:34,672 --> 01:25:44,161
But I know that parts of Tary's tale may not be
the representation that some people hoped for in

840
01:25:44,161 --> 01:25:50,423
media. But I've tried my best to represent other,
happier lives and things where that was an open

841
01:25:50,423 --> 01:25:59,279
and viable circumstance. Tary's is important for
people that grew up like maybe a lot of my friends

842
01:25:59,279 --> 01:26:08,306
did, and didn't have that open, welcoming
scenario. And I can't believe I'm doing this on

843
01:26:08,306 --> 01:26:10,407
the internet.

844
01:26:15,605 --> 01:26:25,293
Anyway, I'm sorry. I'm doing the best I can. And
not all stories are going to be for everybody. I

845
01:26:25,293 --> 01:26:30,298
can't please everybody with all the choices we
make. And I mess up and I fail and I stumble. And

846
01:26:30,298 --> 01:26:38,242
even if a few people get offended, I can't help
but feel bad because I hate hurting people. But I

847
01:26:38,242 --> 01:26:54,635
promise I'm doing my best. That's all. You know,
when I said Tary's experience, his scenario at the

848
01:26:54,635 --> 01:27:08,299
end of the last episode with Trish, reminded me of
a lot of friends growing up, you know. Every

849
01:27:08,299 --> 01:27:13,545
person has a point in life where they struggle
with their own identity, and I had that too. I

850
01:27:13,545 --> 01:27:20,589
identify as heterosexual but I've had my years
of curiosity, I've had my years of trying to

851
01:27:20,991 --> 01:27:33,609
figure out what it was, who I was. And yeah, I
myself am primarily attracted to women but there

852
01:27:33,609 --> 01:27:39,731
are men that I've also found attractive in life,
mostly about the person, the individual. And

853
01:27:39,731 --> 01:27:47,313
sometimes it takes an experience like what Tary
had to finally feel confident in that. And not in

854
01:27:47,313 --> 01:27:51,314
a judgmental way. His was a little more comical
because it's Sam, and we want to play up the

855
01:27:51,314 --> 01:27:56,294
discomfort of a sequence sometimes with humor to
offset it, but we try and treat it with respect

856
01:27:56,294 --> 01:28:03,578
because a lot of it plays to elements of our own
lives or people that are close to us. And so

857
01:28:03,578 --> 01:28:08,611
Tary's journey is in some ways still a personal
one for myself and other people in some ways. So

858
01:28:08,611 --> 01:28:11,138
just, you know. We're trying.

859
01:28:12,468 --> 01:28:26,692
Anyway. Wow, that happened. Let's go to the next
monster thing. (laughing) Jesus Christ. (sighs) So

860
01:28:26,692 --> 01:28:40,177
tiny. What type of monster we doing, yo?
Celestial. Tiny celestial encounter. That's going

861
01:28:40,177 --> 01:28:47,630
to be-- oh, I'm good, no pizza, thank you. I got
popcorn and port, yo. And a fireplace. What more

862
01:28:47,630 --> 01:28:53,042
could you want?

863
01:28:53,042 --> 01:28:58,444
Ability score focus. What is this tiny celestial
really good at? We're going to make this a six

864
01:28:58,444 --> 01:29:04,909
choice. A six choice straw poll here. So we're
going to go ability scores, of course strength,

865
01:29:04,909 --> 01:29:13,004
dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom,
charisma. The classics. I want to know what this

866
01:29:13,004 --> 01:29:15,791
tiny celestial is really damn good at. What is it
really good at? So we're going to put that in

867
01:29:15,791 --> 01:29:19,807
there, have you guys vote and we'll see just how
nasty this thing can be. So pay attention to the

868
01:29:19,807 --> 01:29:26,475
chat, we'll have that up there in a moment. We're
going to go ahead and do some more questions. And

869
01:29:26,475 --> 01:29:30,343
I'll keep it together going forward. (laughs)

870
01:29:30,343 --> 01:29:35,299
Talisar: question, "How excited are you for the
new Bill Nye show?" I actually watched a few

871
01:29:35,299 --> 01:29:41,891
episodes of it. I'm conflicted. I love Bill Nye,
and I grew up loving Bill Nye and I'm a firm

872
01:29:41,891 --> 01:29:46,924
believer in everything he has to say. I think in
some ways we're entering this weird era that is

873
01:29:46,924 --> 01:29:56,098
undermining intellectualism and fact and it's
really frustrating. And I think he's been a great

874
01:29:56,098 --> 01:30:04,372
beacon for that in public spheres.

875
01:30:04,402 --> 01:30:08,689
The tone of his show is a little strange because I
feel like it's a little preaching to the choir so

876
01:30:08,689 --> 01:30:14,455
far. I feel like it would be a better message to
try and have the show presented in a way that is

877
01:30:14,455 --> 01:30:19,524
speaking to the other side and explaining why it's
important to listen to what the facts or what the

878
01:30:19,524 --> 01:30:24,962
science is. The show so far, from what I've seen,
comes across a little preachy and a little

879
01:30:24,962 --> 01:30:29,884
condescending to those who many not believe, and I
don't think that necessarily befits his argument

880
01:30:29,884 --> 01:30:33,944
in the best way. It's still a great show, and I'm
liking it so far, but that would be my one

881
01:30:33,944 --> 01:30:41,753
critique on it is that it comes across a little
self-righteous in a way that might turn off the

882
01:30:41,753 --> 01:30:45,602
people who really should be listening to it and
learning from it. Otherwise it turns into an echo

883
01:30:45,602 --> 01:30:50,760
chamber. But I'm excited to check out the rest of
it and hope that that picks up a little bit and I

884
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:54,101
love everything he's done in the past. I think
it's important that we have more figures like that

885
01:30:54,101 --> 01:30:58,357
that are both public figures, like Neil deGrasse
Tyson and Bill Nye, that are champions of science,

886
01:30:58,357 --> 01:31:03,978
champions of reason, champions of fact and I'm
excited to see more of that type of content. I'll

887
01:31:03,978 --> 01:31:06,524
see more of it.

888
01:31:06,524 --> 01:31:10,519
I will say the new Mystery Science Theater is
fucking awesome. As a person who grew up watching

889
01:31:10,519 --> 01:31:14,875
the original Comedy Central run when I was a kid
when I first moved out to California. I'm a Joel

890
01:31:14,875 --> 01:31:19,921
guy. I love Mike, but Joel is my guy all the way
and I've watched every episode. I was so scared

891
01:31:19,921 --> 01:31:25,794
for the reboot. So scared because it could have
gone wrong in so many ways. I legitimately teared

892
01:31:25,794 --> 01:31:29,359
up multiple times watching the first episode of
the new Netflix show because it felt like the old

893
01:31:29,359 --> 01:31:36,233
show to me. I was so excited, even the final
credits sequence. They even have a new version of

894
01:31:36,233 --> 01:31:42,115
the old, sad orchestral version of the MST3K theme
and I was just tears and smiling. I tend to cry a

895
01:31:42,115 --> 01:31:54,384
lot. I'm a sensitive boy if you haven't figured
that out by now.

896
01:31:54,384 --> 01:32:02,565
Ability score focus, do we have an answer on that
yet? What is it? Charisma. This'll be interesting,

897
01:32:02,565 --> 01:32:17,919
okay. Let's do three focuses here, this will be
combat-focus for the creature. So it's a tiny

898
01:32:17,919 --> 01:32:23,563
celestial charisma-based entity. Do we want it to
be melee-focused? Not mee-lee. I'm trying to be

899
01:32:23,563 --> 01:32:28,014
better about that. I grew up saying mee-lee and
it's an old habit hard to break. I know it's

900
01:32:28,014 --> 01:32:33,135
melee. I'm trying, guys, I know it bothers a lot
of you. Melee, ranged-focused, or spell-focused.

901
01:32:33,135 --> 01:32:45,176
Or you know what, environment-focused. So it might
get in the fray with people, it might attack them

902
01:32:45,176 --> 01:32:50,125
from a distance, it might do a spell caster type,
or focused on using the environment to its

903
01:32:50,125 --> 01:32:56,651
advantage. We'll throw those choices up in the
poll and we'll see what that one comes out to in a

904
01:32:56,651 --> 01:32:59,397
moment.

905
01:33:03,148 --> 01:33:09,511
An hour and a half goes fast, guys! Thanks for
chilling as long as you have and watch me be

906
01:33:09,511 --> 01:33:16,117
ridiculous on camera with you for a while.
ScrubsFan06 asks a question, "What's your favorite

907
01:33:16,117 --> 01:33:24,316
band?" Oh, that's a tough one. My father was a
musician, I was raised on The Beatles, Moody

908
01:33:24,316 --> 01:33:31,086
Blues, Steely Dan, Al Parsons Project, so I come
from that background. Then I was also introduced

909
01:33:31,086 --> 01:33:37,954
more to modern bands. I say modern, I was a kid of
the 90s like Stone Temple Pilots, Type O

910
01:33:37,954 --> 01:33:44,352
Negative-- love Type O Negative, great
pseudo-almost-not-serious goth rock. It's

911
01:33:44,352 --> 01:33:50,093
beautiful. But I think the musician that's
affected me the most would be Mike Patton and his

912
01:33:50,093 --> 01:33:58,102
work on Mr. Bungle. Many other musical projects
that are fantastic: Fantomas, Tomahawk, Lovage,

913
01:33:58,102 --> 01:34:05,094
some of his solo stuff, but his work on Mr. Bungle
is so avant-garde and strange and changed my

914
01:34:05,094 --> 01:34:14,502
perspective on music and vocals. Gogol Bordello is
a great choice, too, Gogol Bordello is fantastic.

915
01:34:14,502 --> 01:34:24,616
Mike Patton's work has been heavily inspiring in
so many ways. He's probably the closest I have as

916
01:34:24,616 --> 01:34:29,184
far as a vocal match when it comes to music. So if
there's anybody I can sing along with in the car,

917
01:34:29,184 --> 01:34:34,316
Mr. Bungle, I'm right there. I have a secret dream
that ever I end up with too much time on my hands

918
01:34:34,316 --> 01:34:39,443
that I'll do a Mr. Bungle tribute band and do a
show once in the Roxie just for my friends. I want

919
01:34:39,443 --> 01:34:45,540
to do that one day. Will it ever happen? I don't
know. Mike Patton's my boy.

920
01:34:48,421 --> 01:35:00,766
Straw poll's up, guys, you got to vote! LolKeegan
says, "Matt, kind of stagnant in life with no

921
01:35:00,766 --> 01:35:04,625
direction. Do you have any friends, or were you
yourself like that? How did you find your

922
01:35:04,625 --> 01:35:09,729
direction and motivation or whatever?" Yeah, a
number of times. That's not an uncommon

923
01:35:09,729 --> 01:35:14,333
experience. If anything, take solace in the fact
that all of us eventually find ourself there at

924
01:35:14,333 --> 01:35:20,339
some point or another. Before I went to Burning
Man, I was in that place. Out of school, I was in

925
01:35:20,339 --> 01:35:29,166
that place. Right before I met Marisha, to a
certain extent, I was in that place, too. Change

926
01:35:29,166 --> 01:35:39,518
of scenery helps more than anything. Being stuck,
stagnant, and being in a place of comfort that is

927
01:35:39,518 --> 01:35:44,873
affiliated with that stagnation, in my opinion,
can be a very stifling atmosphere without

928
01:35:44,873 --> 01:35:51,778
realizing it. I recommend taking a drive by
yourself. Just drive. If you're near a coast, up

929
01:35:51,778 --> 01:35:58,205
the coast and find a bit of beach to sit and think
for a few hours on your own. Bring some snacks,

930
01:35:58,205 --> 01:36:04,380
bring some wine. Or go into the desert, or go into
the woods and commune with your surroundings. Go

931
01:36:04,380 --> 01:36:10,478
to a place that's outside of what's normal and
comfortable to you. Both to force yourself out of

932
01:36:10,478 --> 01:36:12,613
your comfort zone, but to put you in a space where
you can start thinking outside of the way you

933
01:36:12,613 --> 01:36:20,797
normally do. I can't say that's a guaranteed
answer, but that can begin to help with forcing

934
01:36:20,797 --> 01:36:26,032
you to think outside of the normal, "Woe is me, I
can't do anything, I can't change anything."

935
01:36:26,032 --> 01:36:29,084
You've already changed one thing; you've changed
your scenery. You've already discovered a new

936
01:36:29,084 --> 01:36:33,171
place that you can go to for solace. A place you
can bring a friend once you have these moments to

937
01:36:33,171 --> 01:36:43,682
think to yourself. Maybe try a hobby you've always
wanted to and never gave yourself the gumption to

938
01:36:43,682 --> 01:36:51,125
do it. You were always like, "I've always wanted
to try sculpting." Do it! Buy some clay. Look on

939
01:36:51,125 --> 01:36:54,483
YouTube. There's so many great tutorials for
anything you could ever want to do, ever, period,

940
01:36:54,483 --> 01:37:00,268
on the internet now! Buy some clay and start
sculpting in your house. Or go to a class if

941
01:37:00,268 --> 01:37:05,054
there's one nearby that you can afford. Do some
life drawing. Something artistic, something

942
01:37:05,054 --> 01:37:11,579
creative, something that spurs the brain outside
of the numbers and the mathematics. That may be

943
01:37:11,579 --> 01:37:14,440
enough of a change of your normal way of thinking
that it might inspire different directions to

944
01:37:14,440 --> 01:37:18,833
look. It might lead your right on the path or put
you in that direction. There's no guarantee,

945
01:37:18,833 --> 01:37:23,698
there's no right answer to this, but that's
something that's worked for me and it's worked for

946
01:37:23,698 --> 01:37:29,190
some people i know. At least, it might be a start.
Wish I had better answers for you, but I hope that

947
01:37:29,190 --> 01:37:30,620
helps.

948
01:37:32,777 --> 01:37:38,316
What's the answer on the straw poll? Environment!
Not going to lie, I was hoping you were going to

949
01:37:38,316 --> 01:37:48,484
say that. That's going to be a fun, fucked up
battle. Okay! And last but not least, let's get a

950
01:37:48,484 --> 01:37:58,191
name. Whatever cool first names come out of the
chat I'll start pulling them and we'll put them in

951
01:37:58,191 --> 01:38:03,795
with a straw poll based off that. Don't be
offended if I don't pick yours. I'm going to grab

952
01:38:03,795 --> 01:38:09,431
ones that seem interesting and throw them up
there. Look here for a second. You guys throw the

953
01:38:09,431 --> 01:38:41,781
chaos at me. Let's do K-A-E-O-R-A. Let's do
B-A-L-K-A-N-U-S. Y-O-R-T. E-X-E-L-O-N. Ooh! I like

954
01:38:41,781 --> 01:39:07,623
that one! Symphior. Symphony, but S-Y-M-P-H-I-O-R.
Going celestial here, folks. L-E-T-H apostrophe

955
01:39:07,623 --> 01:39:24,840
E-S-S. Symphior, I think it was? Symphony,
S-Y-M-P-H-I-O-R. And we'll put that in. I hope

956
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:30,378
that's right. If it's not, that's what it is now!
We'll get that started and we'll start pouring

957
01:39:30,378 --> 01:39:40,816
through some answers on that. We'll see what names
comes to! Congratulations. Oh man. I've already

958
01:39:40,816 --> 01:39:45,310
got some ideas on this one. These might not appear
very soon in the arc, but they're going to be

959
01:39:45,310 --> 01:39:52,493
worked into the arc. It'll be a surprise to you
guys as it will be for the players when they come

960
01:39:52,493 --> 01:39:54,763
and we'll work this out. Should be fun.

961
01:39:54,763 --> 01:39:59,717
We got about 20 minutes here, I want to get some
more questions. "What instrument would you play?"

962
01:39:59,717 --> 01:40:05,213
from KosaWanKenobi. Funny, my father, a musician,
played many instruments. I got a lot of

963
01:40:05,213 --> 01:40:08,355
instruments for Christmas over the years, messed
them for a day, lost interest, and gave them to my

964
01:40:08,355 --> 01:40:15,920
little brother who then became the musician. He
plays trumpet, trombone, guitar, drums, piano,

965
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:23,790
everything. I'm bookended by extremely talented
musicians and all I do is sing. I'm a little

966
01:40:23,790 --> 01:40:29,576
sheepish about instruments. I'm a decent drummer
in Rock Band. I hover in that Hard to Expert

967
01:40:29,576 --> 01:40:34,972
level, or at least I was in my heyday. I've gotten
a little rusty since then, I'm sure. But if I

968
01:40:34,972 --> 01:40:46,465
could play, like really play, I'd probably go--
any instrument? Violin. I love the violin. It's

969
01:40:46,465 --> 01:40:52,064
such a beautiful instrument, such a beautiful
sound that can evoke so many rich emotions. You

970
01:40:52,064 --> 01:40:58,934
can tell a story through just a note. I've had my
heart tugged on and smashed and uplifted by just a

971
01:40:58,934 --> 01:41:04,250
single solo violin piece. It's a beautiful
instrument and it takes a lot of practice. Anyone

972
01:41:04,250 --> 01:41:09,976
out there who plays violin, all the power to you,
all the love. I don't have the time. Maybe one

973
01:41:09,976 --> 01:41:13,808
day. Maybe in my retirement I'll learn to play the
violin. But that's definitely my favorite

974
01:41:13,808 --> 01:41:16,706
instrument of all.

975
01:41:18,827 --> 01:41:24,634
KungFuPanzer asks, "How is this date going? Are we
going to see each other again? Does Marisha mind?"

976
01:41:24,634 --> 01:41:31,566
I think it's a great-- probably going great until
I emotionally spilled all over you. That's when

977
01:41:31,566 --> 01:41:37,469
you retract and go, "Okay! This guy's a bit much,
he's got some baggage." We'll be good friends, and

978
01:41:37,469 --> 01:41:41,885
we'll probably hang out and get drinks and I'll
introduce you to Marisha. We'll all go out and

979
01:41:41,885 --> 01:41:47,223
wander the CIA Bar of North Hollywood probably and
drink over a dead clown under a glass. That's a

980
01:41:47,223 --> 01:41:54,724
real phrase about a real thing, you should look it
up! It's terrifying.

981
01:41:56,311 --> 01:42:00,557
ButtAssBooty said, "Did you ever mow your lawn?" I
did. I said that earlier, but I wanted to say your

982
01:42:00,557 --> 01:42:09,003
name out loud. So there you go. Congratulations.
Question: Do I like camping? from Asimilie. I love

983
01:42:09,003 --> 01:42:15,428
camping! I love it so much. I don't get to go
anywhere near as often as I'd like. I think we're

984
01:42:15,428 --> 01:42:21,743
trying to plan a Vox Machina group camping trip as
soon as we all get time because we all have wanted

985
01:42:21,743 --> 01:42:25,493
to do that for a long time. Trying to find a
weekend that'll work. I love camping. I went a lot

986
01:42:25,493 --> 01:42:31,664
with my family. We'd go up to Mount Whitney
through all the mountain ranges up through Big

987
01:42:31,664 --> 01:42:37,170
Sur. Yeah, camping was great. My mom was
hilarious. She loved to camp, but she also loved

988
01:42:37,170 --> 01:42:40,385
some amenities. She was the only person I knew who
would get up in the morning and heat up her

989
01:42:40,385 --> 01:42:47,346
curling iron in the campfire to do her hair. While
camping. My mom, I love her to death. That's a

990
01:42:47,346 --> 01:42:55,275
memory I will always hold dear in my heart.
Crouched down, dirty, heating up her curling iron.

991
01:42:55,275 --> 01:43:00,513
That's awesome.

992
01:43:00,513 --> 01:43:08,591
Interesting other questions. "What music are you
listening to at the moment?" from PwnagePanda. A

993
01:43:08,591 --> 01:43:15,842
lot of CHVRCHES, as you've probably seen from the
shirt. Every single tiny trickle of Lorde that

994
01:43:15,842 --> 01:43:23,851
comes out I obsess over and latch onto right now.
Good EDM, I enjoy as a good general creative

995
01:43:23,851 --> 01:43:28,569
space. I say good EDM because there's a lot of
shitty EDM. I briefly fell in love with the

996
01:43:28,569 --> 01:43:32,689
Chainsmokers then quickly fell out of love with
them after seeing interviews with the douchebros

997
01:43:32,689 --> 01:43:45,899
that are them. Good EDM I really enjoy. Classic
Radiohead never dies. Paranoid Android era was

998
01:43:45,899 --> 01:43:54,560
fantastic. Spotify's allowed me go back and listen
to a lot of old songs from my teen years that I

999
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:59,593
hadn't had access to in awhile, so that's pretty
rad. We got really heavily into CHVRCHES right

1000
01:43:59,593 --> 01:44:03,624
around the time me and Marisha got engaged, so
CHVRCHES has been our happy theme for a while, the

1001
01:44:03,624 --> 01:44:08,029
most recent album. That's a recurring theme with
us recently.

1002
01:44:13,954 --> 01:44:20,794
"Favorite sweet alcoholic beverage?" from
Aquajolt. If we're going dancing, and I don't want

1003
01:44:20,794 --> 01:44:24,244
to spend a lot of time drinking or spend a lot of
money on multiple drinks, I'll get a Long Island

1004
01:44:24,244 --> 01:44:29,961
Iced Tea because you just need one and it gets the
job done and you're ready to go dancing. If it's

1005
01:44:29,961 --> 01:44:36,684
more of a casual conversation, if we're all at a
small dive bar talking for hours, I'll probably

1006
01:44:36,684 --> 01:44:42,840
get a Kentucky Mule; some bourbon, ginger beer,
little bit of lime and sip on that for a while.

1007
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:48,669
Those are probably my two current favorites.
Utility purposes different, definitely.

1008
01:44:51,318 --> 01:45:02,098
Question: Worst video game I've ever played by
Timmy32. Oh man. There are some bad games. But

1009
01:45:02,098 --> 01:45:09,607
they're known to be bad. I worked on some bad
games! I worked on a whole bunch of Shrek titles.

1010
01:45:09,607 --> 01:45:14,524
My job, before becoming a voice actor, I worked in
QA in game development side then worked into

1011
01:45:14,524 --> 01:45:19,556
producing in game development. I worked at a
company TDK Media Active for a number of years and

1012
01:45:19,556 --> 01:45:27,479
made Shrek licensed products that were terrible:
Shrek Party, Mario Party ripoff, but it was

1013
01:45:27,479 --> 01:45:36,507
Shrek-related. That was really bad. Oh man, there
were some really bad games. Fallout: Brotherhood

1014
01:45:36,507 --> 01:45:43,120
of Steel, the turn-based RTS tried to make. As a
Fallout fan who loved Fallout one and two broke my

1015
01:45:43,120 --> 01:45:50,261
heart because it was <i>not</i> a good game. For me,
having a broken game is terrible, but having a

1016
01:45:50,261 --> 01:45:58,195
broken game with a great license is even more
painful. That really kills me.

1017
01:45:58,663 --> 01:46:03,124
HoundRider9000's question: "Ever consider short
hair?" Yes, I don't look good with it, I don't

1018
01:46:03,124 --> 01:46:07,931
think so, not for me. Long hair's been my thing
for most of my life, long-ish. I've gone through

1019
01:46:07,931 --> 01:46:11,440
stages. You've seen it shorter sometimes on the
show. Yeah, I cut it a little shorter and it

1020
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:17,648
eventually grows out. I just don't look good with
short hair. I feel cold and naked and alone if

1021
01:46:17,648 --> 01:46:23,467
it's too short, I don't like it. So my hair will
probably be some degree of long-ish or at least

1022
01:46:23,467 --> 01:46:26,815
ragged, I guess.

1023
01:46:31,116 --> 01:46:36,131
Zenez8 says, "Favorite voice line and what one
bugs Marisha the most?" Favorite voice line? It is

1024
01:46:36,131 --> 01:46:48,487
a gift, it is an absolute blessing that I have
been given a catchphrase in McCree. I'm going to

1025
01:46:48,487 --> 01:46:52,425
have it with me the rest of my days. As much as
people might be like, "Oh my god, he's so annoyed

1026
01:46:52,425 --> 01:46:57,110
to have to say, 'It's high noon' all the time,"
it's like, no, that's fantastic. I'm always happy

1027
01:46:57,110 --> 01:47:01,305
to say it if someone's very respectful about it
and not be like, "Hey, Matt, what time is it?" I'd

1028
01:47:01,305 --> 01:47:08,362
be like: all right, dude, relax. That's wonderful,
that's a catchphrase. Very few people get that. So

1029
01:47:08,362 --> 01:47:13,283
I love it. I'm really excited that I have that.
That would probably be the most iconic quote that

1030
01:47:13,283 --> 01:47:21,709
I have, character line. Bothers Marisha the most?
Any of the MacCready post-romance wakeup lines

1031
01:47:21,709 --> 01:47:28,125
from Fallout 4. We'll wake up in the morning,
sun's coming through our blinds in the bedroom and

1032
01:47:28,125 --> 01:47:31,241
she's starting to wake up and I'll lean over and
be like (MacCready voice) So are you ready to face

1033
01:47:31,241 --> 01:47:37,221
the day? (normal voice) And she'll punch me.
Rightfully so. I'll give her shit about that every

1034
01:47:37,221 --> 01:47:40,237
now and then. (laughs)

1035
01:47:42,528 --> 01:47:50,756
Playgratchansee question is, "Any tips on how to
deal with players who fight over items and gold?"

1036
01:47:50,756 --> 01:47:54,645
Talk to them and say, "Guys, seriously, you need
to work this out. Otherwise, we're not going to

1037
01:47:54,645 --> 01:48:00,247
play. Be respectful and figure this out." If
there's still a problem, maybe have them encounter

1038
01:48:00,247 --> 01:48:07,138
some sort of extremely powerful archfey entity
that is true neutral and really feels everything

1039
01:48:07,138 --> 01:48:12,862
should be fair and has found interest in them and
follows them silently, invisibly. If at any point

1040
01:48:12,862 --> 01:48:18,053
they start fighting over loot, threatens them with
complete and utter destruction. So be fair and

1041
01:48:18,053 --> 01:48:22,785
place nice, otherwise the fey will destroy and
consume you. Find story reasons to fuck with them

1042
01:48:23,218 --> 01:48:31,849
and force them to play nice, too. (laughs) Cursed
items! Also a great deal! That really greedy guy

1043
01:48:31,849 --> 01:48:34,531
who keeps grabbing everything, throw him a couple
of cursed items and let him deal. "Oh, man, you

1044
01:48:34,531 --> 01:48:40,101
took that first, put it on! Oh no, you're
withering!" Good on you for that, chat, that's

1045
01:48:40,101 --> 01:48:45,255
another great suggestion. Communist fey. Yes,
exactly!

1046
01:48:46,363 --> 01:48:54,087
"Question: Star Wars or Star Trek and why?"
Interesting question. I grew up loving fantasy.

1047
01:48:54,087 --> 01:48:59,796
High fantasy's my jam. I should love Star Wars as
much as the next person. I enjoy Star Wars, and I

1048
01:48:59,796 --> 01:49:03,688
watch the trilogy a lot. But I wasn't into it as a
lot of kids I knew. I used to have all the toys,

1049
01:49:03,688 --> 01:49:09,400
the bedsheets, everything. But I was a Tolkien
kid. For me, it was either high fantasy or high

1050
01:49:09,400 --> 01:49:16,533
fantasy in space. To me, I leaned more high
fantasy. But I love the original trilogy and I

1051
01:49:16,533 --> 01:49:22,054
watched it a bunch as a kid, too. When I got into
Star Trek right around the Next Generation era

1052
01:49:22,054 --> 01:49:27,008
when that first came out, that was so radically
different than anything I had gotten into that I

1053
01:49:27,008 --> 01:49:36,994
immediately leaned towards that. So my very
"realistic" sci-fi Star Trek utopian society, the

1054
01:49:36,994 --> 01:49:43,525
future exploring the cosmos in a very colonizing
harmony-type way was so radically different than

1055
01:49:43,525 --> 01:49:50,744
any other sci-fi I had experienced outside of Asimov
and Arthur C. Clarke books I had grown up with

1056
01:49:51,435 --> 01:49:54,885
that I fell in love with that. I definitely
started more as a Star Trek person. I've come to

1057
01:49:54,885 --> 01:50:03,335
enjoy Star Wars more as the years go on, but I
think Star Trek had more of an impact on my youth.

1058
01:50:03,335 --> 01:50:07,377
I had Lord of the Rings as more of my fantasy and
Star Trek as more of my sci-fi. Star Wars is in

1059
01:50:07,377 --> 01:50:14,563
the middle, I adhered to the two extremes, if that
makes sense. Don't hate me on the internet! Too

1060
01:50:14,563 --> 01:50:15,592
late.

1061
01:50:16,688 --> 01:50:22,692
Phalanx66, "Question: new tattoo?" I do have some
new ideas. When the campaign guide is over and out

1062
01:50:22,692 --> 01:50:26,199
there, I'm going to talk with Marisha, I haven't
decided yet, but I'm thinking about getting the

1063
01:50:26,199 --> 01:50:32,120
outline of Tal'Dorei tattooed on my back. Just the
outline of the continent and with each campaign

1064
01:50:32,120 --> 01:50:35,712
guide, if they keep happening, I'll add more
continents until eventually I have all of Exandria

1065
01:50:35,712 --> 01:50:41,914
on my back as just outlines. It's an idea I've
had. An idea. Don't know if it's going to happen,

1066
01:50:41,914 --> 01:50:47,068
but you know, that was something that came up.

1067
01:50:52,965 --> 01:50:59,864
"Favorite action movie character?" Hudson Hawk. If
you don't know who that is, you should watch it.

1068
01:50:59,864 --> 01:51:11,643
It's ridiculous. (laughs) "Nerd!" I know, I know!
And I own it. I should. "Favorite doctor from

1069
01:51:11,643 --> 01:51:16,590
Doctor Who?" from FireKnight7. Oh, we've got ten
minutes left, thank you for the reminder. Favorite

1070
01:51:16,590 --> 01:51:21,121
doctor. I grew up on Baker, so he was my
introduction to the world. Doctor Who was

1071
01:51:21,121 --> 01:51:25,402
originally that weird British show that came on at
5:00am. When I'd couldn't sleep or woke up way too

1072
01:51:25,402 --> 01:51:28,711
early as a kid, I'd watch and be like, "I don't
know what's happening, but this is weird and

1073
01:51:28,711 --> 01:51:34,125
awesome." So that was my introduction to Doctor
Who was through Baker who was a great doctor. Love

1074
01:51:34,125 --> 01:51:45,016
his personality, his whimsy is great. It wasn't
until the reboot that it came back that I got back

1075
01:51:45,016 --> 01:51:52,103
into it and Tennant won me over then. It's a close
match between Baker and Tennant, but I think

1076
01:51:52,103 --> 01:52:00,859
Tennant just wins out because he ran the gamut,
especially towards the end of his run. The fury,

1077
01:52:00,859 --> 01:52:10,609
the warrior doctor elements coming through, his
sorrow, his loss. I can't watch his final walk to

1078
01:52:10,609 --> 01:52:17,501
the TARDIS after he takes irradiation right before
his regeneration without becoming a blubbering,

1079
01:52:17,501 --> 01:52:24,471
absence of non-sad emotion. I am an absolute mess.
Mark Humes, actually, from High Rollers, when I

1080
01:52:24,471 --> 01:52:29,333
was London years ago, I dragged him to the Doctor
Who museum because he hates Doctor Who. I was

1081
01:52:29,333 --> 01:52:32,382
like, "You're coming with you because you're my
host." He hated it the whole time. It was me and

1082
01:52:32,382 --> 01:52:39,091
him and a bunch of kids and it was amazing. They
had the actual TARDIS console of the Tennant-era

1083
01:52:39,091 --> 01:52:42,314
TARDIS and it was all busted up and I was like,
"Cool, this is the console!" And I hear this music

1084
01:52:42,314 --> 01:52:45,767
and I was like, "Where's the music coming from,
it's really sad? That's really familiar." I look

1085
01:52:45,767 --> 01:52:49,517
over and I'm like, "That's the song of the Ood!"
And they have a big screen that had Tennant

1086
01:52:49,517 --> 01:52:54,067
walking through the snow, slowly making his way to
the TARDIS and I start bawling. I watched the

1087
01:52:54,067 --> 01:52:59,622
whole sequence of them saying, "I don't want to
go!" Tears everywhere and I'm blubbering, heaving,

1088
01:52:59,622 --> 01:53:04,625
sobbing grown man in the middle of a Doctor Who
museum a bunch of kids who are confused and Mark

1089
01:53:04,625 --> 01:53:10,876
with his arms crossed going, "Fucking hell, mate."
It was amazing. I've dragged that guy through some

1090
01:53:10,953 --> 01:53:13,736
shit. (laughs)

1091
01:53:16,649 --> 01:53:22,052
I'm trying to get through some of these questions
because we have to close this up soon. "Favorite

1092
01:53:22,052 --> 01:53:33,326
non-RPG game?" by AcetaMichelle. That's hard.
Almost all the games I like are RPGs. Street

1093
01:53:33,326 --> 01:53:38,117
Fighter. Actually, not that hard at all. Street
Fighter. I grew up playing Street Fighter

1094
01:53:38,117 --> 01:53:42,303
hardcore. For a brief time, I did tournament
Street Fighter and I can still hold my own pretty

1095
01:53:42,303 --> 01:53:47,230
decently in Street Fighter. There was a time I was
super intense about it. I got really good, my

1096
01:53:47,230 --> 01:53:54,158
prime of my life was during the Alpha Three era.
Alpha Three is still, to this day, my game. I got

1097
01:53:54,158 --> 01:53:58,108
really, deeply into Street Fighter; not just the
competitive aspect, but the lore. There is Street

1098
01:53:58,108 --> 01:54:03,978
Fighter lore! It's confusing, contradicts itself a
lot, but I got really into it. I owned a lot of

1099
01:54:03,978 --> 01:54:07,386
Japanese-import art books about it that I could
only get in Little Tokyo or order online at the

1100
01:54:07,386 --> 01:54:14,822
time off Ebay. I did Kuma for Halloween one year,
I've done Dan Hibiki multiple times. I learned a

1101
01:54:14,822 --> 01:54:18,935
lot of the Japanese phrases. Most Japanese I
learned-- which is very little-- I learned from

1102
01:54:18,935 --> 01:54:22,168
fighting games, mostly Street Fighter. So if I
ever go to Japan, all I can really do is get into

1103
01:54:22,168 --> 01:54:29,504
fights. Not as useful, but that it is what it is.
Street Fighter guy all the way.

1104
01:54:31,951 --> 01:54:40,905
Let's get to some more of these questions at the
bottom. Oh man. GhostlyMuse, "Question for players

1105
01:54:40,905 --> 01:54:44,467
who want to have more variety, are there any
resources you'd recommend for learning accents?"

1106
01:54:44,467 --> 01:54:48,108
Yes! Watch the new episode of Signal Boost to have
Liam O'Brien boost exactly what I'm about to tell

1107
01:54:48,108 --> 01:54:53,648
you, but the IDEA: The International Dialects of
English Archive is a fantastic, free website that

1108
01:54:53,648 --> 01:54:59,873
has recordings of people from all over the world
in all different countries speaking in English,

1109
01:54:59,873 --> 01:55:03,196
reading a story that has all the phonetics and
vowels and all of the different ways you can say

1110
01:55:03,196 --> 01:55:07,142
and pronounce things as part of its construct, and
then they talk about themselves. But it's a great

1111
01:55:07,142 --> 01:55:11,977
resource for listening and learning dialects and
accents from all over the world, if you're good at

1112
01:55:11,977 --> 01:55:16,646
picking them up by ear. Otherwise, you might have
to study a little more and get involved in the

1113
01:55:16,646 --> 01:55:21,736
IPA, which is the International Phonetic Alphabet.
That's a little more of an investment and probably

1114
01:55:21,736 --> 01:55:26,966
more if you're going to go into acting. But the
IDEA is a great resource. Recommend it.

1115
01:55:29,833 --> 01:55:43,349
Zipknoll. Best dream you ever had. That I can say
on air? Best dream only because it was so vivid.

1116
01:55:43,349 --> 01:55:47,870
It wasn't a good dream. It was a nightmare. But it
was so vivid and it was so-- I wrote a short story

1117
01:55:47,870 --> 01:55:54,574
about it in high school and I don't know where it
went. But I had a dream that I was walking home

1118
01:55:54,574 --> 01:56:02,818
from school. This was in high school. And the
entire sky was a roiling gray, cloudy mass. It was

1119
01:56:02,818 --> 01:56:08,654
dark and ominous. It was shifting and moving.
Occasionally, you'd see a skull shape emerge out

1120
01:56:08,654 --> 01:56:15,194
of it or a giant, skeletal hand reach out of it
and then retract into the sky. And there was a

1121
01:56:15,194 --> 01:56:23,322
sense. Everyone understood that something very bad
was going to happen. So I went home with my

1122
01:56:23,322 --> 01:56:27,330
family, my mom, and I was like, "What's going on
outside?" And she goes, "Have you seen the news?"

1123
01:56:27,330 --> 01:56:33,830
And when you look at the news, and as I look over
the monitor, I see this big mountain that was

1124
01:56:33,830 --> 01:56:41,419
visible from our house, this giant, slowly
retracting funnel was making its way down, not in

1125
01:56:41,419 --> 01:56:46,586
a massive tornado way, but it was slowly
descending from the sky, like it had deliberate

1126
01:56:46,586 --> 01:56:48,118
intent to land.

1127
01:56:48,320 --> 01:56:51,747
When you looked at the news, over in Japan-- of
course Japan, because that's where all cataclysms

1128
01:56:51,747 --> 01:57:00,086
start, apparently, this giant obsidian orb, a mile
in diameter, apparated. It was smooth and they had

1129
01:57:00,086 --> 01:57:03,581
the whole, you know, a bunch of different military
forces were brought there to look at it. No one

1130
01:57:03,581 --> 01:57:07,136
knew what it did. Then, one day, a door beneath it
opened. It sat there for a week and everyone was

1131
01:57:07,136 --> 01:57:10,934
like, "What does this mean?" Clouds are there,
this is happening, but nothing's going on. And

1132
01:57:10,934 --> 01:57:16,543
then suddenly, we watch, as this door retracted
from beneath and opened and multitudes of these

1133
01:57:16,543 --> 01:57:22,146
demonic spirits begin to spill out. Thousands upon
thousands upon thousands of them. They all looked

1134
01:57:22,146 --> 01:57:27,825
like devilish entities, but they were spectral.
They couldn't be harmed. They passed through all

1135
01:57:27,825 --> 01:57:32,244
physical matter. They didn't attack anyone. But
what we began to discover was each one of these

1136
01:57:32,244 --> 01:57:39,735
spiritual entities had one corresponding person in
the world, that it knew where they were and was

1137
01:57:39,735 --> 01:57:46,161
going right for them. And whenever it found them,
it embraced the person and they died. So it was

1138
01:57:46,161 --> 01:57:51,313
this extermination of the human race. Each one of
these demonic spirits designed to find the one

1139
01:57:51,313 --> 01:57:55,901
person that they were designed for to eliminate
them. And it was this wave as it went across all

1140
01:57:55,901 --> 01:58:00,358
of Asia to Europe and then made their way into the
U.S. And the rest of the dream was us waiting for

1141
01:58:00,358 --> 01:58:05,096
this to happen. It was this very ominous
acceptance of the end and looking out and seeing

1142
01:58:05,096 --> 01:58:09,092
these waves of entities coming over the mountain
that I started the dream with, and then coming

1143
01:58:09,092 --> 01:58:11,633
through the valley, through the neighborhood, and
coming towards us. And that's the last point I

1144
01:58:11,633 --> 01:58:16,528
remember. Dark as fuck dream and I apologize for
that! But it was so vivid, the imagery to me, that

1145
01:58:16,528 --> 01:58:20,504
I filled my sketchbook and I began to write a
story about it. And the imagery inspired me in

1146
01:58:20,504 --> 01:58:24,550
certain ways, so that was probably one of my
favorite dreams, but not one of the best dreams,

1147
01:58:24,550 --> 01:58:26,986
but one of my favorites.

1148
01:58:26,986 --> 01:58:30,336
Okay, we're having to close this up here because
we're getting to the end of the six o'clock period

1149
01:58:30,336 --> 01:58:36,166
here. You guys are awesome. Thank you so much for
coming and hanging out today. We ran a gamut of

1150
01:58:36,166 --> 01:58:40,595
emotions thoughts and we created a couple of NPCs
and monsters. This was a promise from a charity

1151
01:58:40,595 --> 01:58:44,613
game a while back, so thank you for being patient
with that. We're getting things geared up again.

1152
01:58:44,613 --> 01:58:49,010
But we appreciate you guys so much. Thank you
listening, hanging with me, hanging with my

1153
01:58:49,010 --> 01:58:55,341
awesome fake fire. And I hope you have yourself a
wonderful day. I'll see you guys Thursday for the

1154
01:58:55,341 --> 01:59:02,890
continuation of Vox Machina's adventures and is it
Thursday yet? In the meantime, some of us will see

1155
01:59:02,890 --> 01:59:07,157
you at Talks Machina in about an hour or so. Take
care.
