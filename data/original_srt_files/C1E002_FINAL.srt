1
00:00:00,451 --> 00:00:02,467
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome
to the second episode

2
00:00:02,467 --> 00:00:04,638
of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

3
00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:06,500
crazy voice actor, nerdy types sit here

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,650
and play Dungeons and Dragons.

5
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,681
We'll be continuing from
last week's adventure,

6
00:00:09,681 --> 00:00:11,388
so in the meantime, let's
go ahead and show you some

7
00:00:11,388 --> 00:00:13,593
of the character backstory.

8
00:00:13,593 --> 00:00:15,229
TRAVIS: Right, listen up.

9
00:00:15,229 --> 00:00:19,396
If you have ale, then you have
a friend in Grog Strongjaw.

10
00:00:20,912 --> 00:00:24,440
A goliath of towering height and size,

11
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,411
this barbarian has an appetite
for the two great loves

12
00:00:28,411 --> 00:00:31,411
in his life: combat, women, and ale.

13
00:00:33,578 --> 00:00:34,864
(record scratching)

14
00:00:34,864 --> 00:00:35,697
Wait.

15
00:00:35,697 --> 00:00:38,939
Easily the brains of
the group, Grog is often

16
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:42,780
consulted for his vast
knowledge of shapes, colors,

17
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,197
and shiny things.

18
00:00:45,441 --> 00:00:46,274
Also ale.

19
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:51,530
In his early years, armed
with his two-handed greataxe,

20
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,276
Grog oft enjoyed proving
his might amongst the ranks

21
00:00:54,276 --> 00:00:57,024
of his family's wandering herd,

22
00:00:57,024 --> 00:01:00,091
but after coming upon an
unsuspecting elderly gnome

23
00:01:00,091 --> 00:01:02,794
in the woods, he objected to the killing

24
00:01:02,794 --> 00:01:05,610
of such an innocent life.

25
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,060
A creature of impulse, Grog
felt only pity for this,

26
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,953
(chuckles) this terrified little thing.

27
00:01:13,953 --> 00:01:17,028
His disobedience cost him dearly.

28
00:01:17,028 --> 00:01:20,519
Beaten bloody and banished
by the herd leader,

29
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:24,686
his uncle Kevdak, Grog was
abandoned and left to die.

30
00:01:25,622 --> 00:01:29,062
Exiled from his herd, it
was then that the relative

31
00:01:29,062 --> 00:01:32,979
of the very gnome he
fought to save, saved him.

32
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,751
It was the kindness of a
gnome cleric named Pike

33
00:01:37,751 --> 00:01:41,837
that healed Grog, bringing
him back from death's edge.

34
00:01:41,837 --> 00:01:45,502
And they have remained
close friends ever since.

35
00:01:45,502 --> 00:01:49,341
Most nights, Grog can be found
challenging entire taverns

36
00:01:49,341 --> 00:01:51,505
to wrestling matches, ha!

37
00:01:51,505 --> 00:01:54,224
Or accompanying Scanlan
to the nearest house

38
00:01:54,224 --> 00:01:57,141
where you pay for lady favors, huh.

39
00:01:58,729 --> 00:01:59,562
Also ale.

40
00:02:01,331 --> 00:02:02,792
MARISHA: A first impression of Keyleth

41
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:04,511
would leave you with little information

42
00:02:04,511 --> 00:02:06,326
on the half-elven druid.

43
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:08,625
You might even think that
her social awkwardness

44
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:11,962
due to her sheltered
upbringing is kind of sweet.

45
00:02:11,962 --> 00:02:15,591
Of course, it would be
unwise to underestimate her

46
00:02:15,591 --> 00:02:16,961
based on first impressions.

47
00:02:16,961 --> 00:02:18,657
(lightning roaring)

48
00:02:18,657 --> 00:02:21,114
Under that unintimidating, petite frame

49
00:02:21,114 --> 00:02:23,749
is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed

50
00:02:23,749 --> 00:02:25,957
whose natural powers have
made even the fiercest

51
00:02:25,957 --> 00:02:30,653
of champions pee their
pants, literally. (giggles)

52
00:02:30,653 --> 00:02:33,450
Born to the air tribe
of the Ashari people,

53
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,019
Keyleth was raised with
a deep love of nature

54
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:38,065
and the elemental magics.

55
00:02:38,065 --> 00:02:39,748
It is her people's inherent duty

56
00:02:39,748 --> 00:02:42,542
to protect the delicate
areas in Tal'Dorei,

57
00:02:42,542 --> 00:02:44,918
where the four elemental
planes begins to bleed

58
00:02:44,918 --> 00:02:46,708
with this realm.

59
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,907
Since she was a little
girl, she had quite a knack

60
00:02:48,907 --> 00:02:52,455
for air manipulation and
beastshaping abilities.

61
00:02:52,455 --> 00:02:55,259
Well, if you consider
kittens and flying squirrels

62
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:57,209
to be little beasts,

63
00:02:57,209 --> 00:02:58,371
which I do.

64
00:02:58,371 --> 00:02:59,204
(clears throat)

65
00:02:59,204 --> 00:03:02,522
Anyways, it wasn't long before
the headmaster of the tribe,

66
00:03:02,522 --> 00:03:06,185
her father, Kohren, realized
her true prodigious abilities

67
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:08,354
and she was inveterated to succeed him

68
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,895
as the next headmaster.

69
00:03:10,895 --> 00:03:13,652
Just like that, her jovial
childhood was stripped

70
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:16,450
and replaced with endless
spell memorization,

71
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,177
teachings from ancient traditions,

72
00:03:18,177 --> 00:03:20,970
and exceedingly high expectations.

73
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,531
Every druid leader-to-be
must embark on a journey

74
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:26,269
to seek out the sister
tribes in order to introduce

75
00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:29,835
and establish respect amongst
the fellow headmasters.

76
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:34,142
They call this the
Aramente, or Noble Odyssey.

77
00:03:34,142 --> 00:03:36,816
When her father felt she was
ready, he set her on the path

78
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:39,078
to truly discovering herself.

79
00:03:39,078 --> 00:03:42,725
Not knowing when, or if,
she will ever return.

80
00:03:42,725 --> 00:03:45,319
As she hikes down the
mountain towards Stillben,

81
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:47,837
she meditated on the task ahead.

82
00:03:47,837 --> 00:03:51,283
Part of the Aramente is proving
yourself a strong warrior,

83
00:03:51,283 --> 00:03:55,771
a valiant protector, and a
wise and compassionate leader.

84
00:03:55,771 --> 00:03:58,666
With this knowledge, one
thought plays in repeat

85
00:03:58,666 --> 00:03:59,666
in her mind:

86
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,958
Is she even worthy?

87
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,323
TALIESIN: Percy was the third child

88
00:04:06,323 --> 00:04:08,806
of seven children, born to a noble family

89
00:04:08,806 --> 00:04:10,251
who lived far to the north

90
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:12,944
in the ancient castle of Whitestone.

91
00:04:12,944 --> 00:04:15,734
With so many siblings to
share the burdens of lordship,

92
00:04:15,734 --> 00:04:16,774
Percy turned his attention

93
00:04:16,774 --> 00:04:20,346
to the sciences,
engineering, and naturalism.

94
00:04:20,346 --> 00:04:24,539
One day, a mysterious couple
named Lord and Lady Briarwood

95
00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:26,119
came to court.

96
00:04:26,119 --> 00:04:28,614
During a feast held in
their honour, the Briarwoods

97
00:04:28,614 --> 00:04:31,309
violently took control
of the castle, killing

98
00:04:31,309 --> 00:04:35,109
or imprisoning everyone who
would stand in their way.

99
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:37,819
Percy awoke chained in the
dungeon, only to be freed

100
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,005
by his younger sister.

101
00:04:40,005 --> 00:04:43,322
Together they fled, chased
by the Briarwoods' men.

102
00:04:43,322 --> 00:04:45,873
As they ran, Percy's
sister took several arrows

103
00:04:45,873 --> 00:04:48,472
to the chest and fell.

104
00:04:48,472 --> 00:04:51,427
Percy kept running, eventually
jumping into a freezing river

105
00:04:51,427 --> 00:04:54,346
and floating unconscious to freedom.

106
00:04:54,346 --> 00:04:56,947
He did not remember waking
up on a fishing boat.

107
00:04:56,947 --> 00:04:59,285
He barely remembered the next two years,

108
00:04:59,285 --> 00:05:03,289
as he slowly made his way
as far south as possible.

109
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:05,992
Then one night, Percy had a dream.

110
00:05:05,992 --> 00:05:08,924
A roaring cloud of smoke
offered him vengeance

111
00:05:08,924 --> 00:05:11,755
against those who destroyed his family.

112
00:05:11,755 --> 00:05:16,010
When he awoke, Percy began
to design his first gun.

113
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:16,843
(gun clicking)

114
00:05:16,843 --> 00:05:19,135
(explosion roaring)

115
00:05:19,135 --> 00:05:20,219
SAM: Oh, you haven't heard

116
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:22,200
of Scanlan Shorthalt?

117
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,770
Well, gird your loins, ladies,

118
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,971
because he has his eye on you.

119
00:05:25,971 --> 00:05:27,893
A talented musician, master of disguise,

120
00:05:27,893 --> 00:05:30,329
and dashingly handsome in his own mind,

121
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:32,634
Scanlan sings songs almost as much

122
00:05:32,634 --> 00:05:34,987
as he sings his own praises.

123
00:05:34,987 --> 00:05:38,284
Born a poor gnome, Scanlan
used his endless charm

124
00:05:38,284 --> 00:05:40,976
and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin

125
00:05:40,976 --> 00:05:42,912
and support his single mother.

126
00:05:42,912 --> 00:05:45,681
One day he was discovered
by a half-orc promoter,

127
00:05:45,681 --> 00:05:49,439
and joined Dr. Dranzel's
Spectacular Traveling Troupe,

128
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,270
where he learned the ways of the world,

129
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:55,799
and honed his skills as
a bard extraordinaire.

130
00:05:55,799 --> 00:05:58,189
A loner much of his life,
Scanlan has never quite

131
00:05:58,189 --> 00:06:00,356
come to terms with the
violent death of his mother

132
00:06:00,356 --> 00:06:02,719
at the hands of a goblin invasion.

133
00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:06,001
While his years on the road
provided many, shall we say,

134
00:06:06,001 --> 00:06:09,449
educational experiences
with the opposite sex,

135
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:12,051
deep down Scanlan yearns for the one thing

136
00:06:12,051 --> 00:06:16,783
he's never known, the true
love of a fellow gnome.

137
00:06:16,783 --> 00:06:19,994
Still, Scanlan considers
himself a lover first,

138
00:06:19,994 --> 00:06:23,599
performer second, and
fighter distant third.

139
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:25,838
On the battlefield,
he'll support his allies,

140
00:06:25,838 --> 00:06:28,160
but rarely draws blood unless it's

141
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,771
to protect fellow gnome, Pike.

142
00:06:30,771 --> 00:06:34,074
Count on Scanlan for a hearty
laugh, a rollicking song,

143
00:06:34,074 --> 00:06:36,544
and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts

144
00:06:36,544 --> 00:06:38,877
and makes the females swoon.

145
00:06:40,536 --> 00:06:43,456
ORION: Greetings and salutations.

146
00:06:43,456 --> 00:06:46,010
I am Tiberius Stormwind.

147
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,201
I hail from a town called Ty'rex,

148
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:50,336
located in the heart of Draconia,

149
00:06:50,336 --> 00:06:52,495
from a politically respected family.

150
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,278
At the age of 15, I succeeded

151
00:06:54,278 --> 00:06:56,104
in passing the Sorcerer's Rite,

152
00:06:56,104 --> 00:06:58,131
showing prodigy-like control of my magic.

153
00:06:58,131 --> 00:07:00,828
The judges and the Draconian
high council were amazed

154
00:07:00,828 --> 00:07:02,617
at how powerful my spells were

155
00:07:02,617 --> 00:07:04,491
for how long I had been training.

156
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:06,990
At 20 years old, I was the
youngest appointed member

157
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,808
of the magic guild in Draconian history.

158
00:07:09,808 --> 00:07:11,447
For the next few years, I almost went mad

159
00:07:11,447 --> 00:07:13,679
from the malaise of being a guild member,

160
00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:16,176
as it's rather boring.

161
00:07:16,176 --> 00:07:18,656
However, one day I
happened upon a chamber,

162
00:07:18,656 --> 00:07:20,666
unused for quite some time.

163
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,710
In the room were stacks of books and maps

164
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:25,554
of the surrounding cities and
areas around the known world.

165
00:07:25,554 --> 00:07:28,037
For months I would frequent the chamber,

166
00:07:28,037 --> 00:07:30,257
and learned of artifacts from legend.

167
00:07:30,257 --> 00:07:33,112
After a long period of research,
I made a list of artifacts

168
00:07:33,112 --> 00:07:34,771
that caught my eye.

169
00:07:34,771 --> 00:07:36,646
I brought these findings
to the high council

170
00:07:36,646 --> 00:07:39,102
and was told that all of the
information in the chamber

171
00:07:39,102 --> 00:07:41,707
I stumbled upon was either
believed to be fiction,

172
00:07:41,707 --> 00:07:45,929
or unsolvable mysteries,
and hence were lost forever.

173
00:07:45,929 --> 00:07:48,829
I found those answers to be unacceptable.

174
00:07:48,829 --> 00:07:51,093
A year later I devised a ruse and managed

175
00:07:51,093 --> 00:07:52,761
to convince the city
council to lend support

176
00:07:52,761 --> 00:07:55,969
in me leaving Draconia on a
mission of peace and diplomacy

177
00:07:55,969 --> 00:07:57,699
for the surrounding kingdoms.

178
00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:00,018
Going from town to town and
making friends and allies,

179
00:08:00,018 --> 00:08:01,828
in and for the name of Draconia.

180
00:08:01,828 --> 00:08:05,871
Being a red dragonborn, I had
quite the task on my hands

181
00:08:05,871 --> 00:08:08,690
in that respect, but it
was exactly what I needed,

182
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:11,556
so I could explore the world
and find these artifacts,

183
00:08:11,556 --> 00:08:14,255
as I felt the truth was out there.

184
00:08:14,255 --> 00:08:16,671
Some may describe me as buffoonish,

185
00:08:16,671 --> 00:08:19,022
but I say poppycock to all that. (mutters)

186
00:08:19,022 --> 00:08:21,420
I am much sharper than
most give me credit for.

187
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,463
I just don't pay attention
to things sometimes.

188
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:27,222
I've also been known to
be rather cunning, loyal,

189
00:08:27,222 --> 00:08:30,222
happy-go-lucky, and well, dangerous.

190
00:08:31,489 --> 00:08:34,596
I can't help but show my true
scales every now and then.

191
00:08:34,596 --> 00:08:38,763
But overall, I think I'm quite
friendly for a dragonborn.

192
00:08:39,674 --> 00:08:41,224
LIAM: Never entirely
welcome in the company

193
00:08:41,224 --> 00:08:44,530
of elves or men, Vax'ildan
learned at a young age

194
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:47,614
to skip past formality, preferring instead

195
00:08:47,614 --> 00:08:50,275
to invite himself in your door.

196
00:08:50,275 --> 00:08:53,091
Along with twin sister
Vex'ahlia, Vax was born

197
00:08:53,091 --> 00:08:55,786
by a chance encounter
between elven royalty

198
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:57,836
and human peasantry.

199
00:08:57,836 --> 00:09:00,408
Raised by their mother
in their early years,

200
00:09:00,408 --> 00:09:02,548
the twins were eventually
sent off to their father

201
00:09:02,548 --> 00:09:04,849
in the elven capital of Syngorn.

202
00:09:04,849 --> 00:09:08,036
But their cool reception among
the elves there never warmed,

203
00:09:08,036 --> 00:09:10,986
and their time in the capital didn't last.

204
00:09:10,986 --> 00:09:13,094
The siblings stole away one autumn night

205
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,986
and set out on the open road.

206
00:09:15,986 --> 00:09:18,638
After a few years of wandering,
they eventually decided

207
00:09:18,638 --> 00:09:21,021
to return to their
mother, and journeyed back

208
00:09:21,021 --> 00:09:23,100
to the lands of their youth.

209
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,792
But instead of finding
their childhood home,

210
00:09:25,792 --> 00:09:28,620
they returned to a pile of rubble.

211
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,298
Their mother was gone,
their home burned to ash.

212
00:09:32,298 --> 00:09:34,785
Pressing the townspeople for answers,

213
00:09:34,785 --> 00:09:37,108
they learned of the day the dragon came.

214
00:09:37,108 --> 00:09:39,691
(loud roaring)

215
00:09:40,942 --> 00:09:44,198
With their ties all severed,
Vax'ildan and his sister

216
00:09:44,198 --> 00:09:48,160
set out to find their fortune
together in Tal'Dorei.

217
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,026
An outsider since birth,
Vax quickly learned

218
00:09:51,026 --> 00:09:55,228
to solve life's challenges
in his own particular way,

219
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:57,988
often by sidestepping them entirely.

220
00:09:57,988 --> 00:10:01,680
And when his knack for circumventing
adversity isn't enough,

221
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,404
(sword slicing)

222
00:10:03,404 --> 00:10:05,813
the way of blades the
elves schooled him in

223
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:08,843
more than makes up the difference.

224
00:10:08,843 --> 00:10:11,416
LAURA: Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia

225
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:14,555
has spent most of her life
suffering the cool reception

226
00:10:14,555 --> 00:10:18,021
of a people who don't fully accept her.

227
00:10:18,021 --> 00:10:21,017
Born of a human mother
and an elven father,

228
00:10:21,017 --> 00:10:24,084
who only later in life took an
interest in their existence,

229
00:10:24,084 --> 00:10:27,120
Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax'ildan

230
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,299
quickly realized the only
people they could truly rely on

231
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:34,440
in this world were each other.

232
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,741
It was at the age of ten
when the two were taken

233
00:10:36,741 --> 00:10:39,947
from their mother, and
brought to live in Syngorn,

234
00:10:39,947 --> 00:10:42,252
the isolated elven city
for which their father

235
00:10:42,252 --> 00:10:43,994
was an ambassador.

236
00:10:43,994 --> 00:10:47,974
He quietly took them in, but
always kept an icy distance,

237
00:10:47,974 --> 00:10:50,889
and after too many years
of disdainful looks,

238
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:54,320
the pair decided to leave
his indifference behind,

239
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,877
and set out on their own.

240
00:10:56,877 --> 00:11:00,308
Vax took to the cities,
stealing small trinkets

241
00:11:00,308 --> 00:11:02,900
and learning the ways of the thief,

242
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,528
while Vex kept to the woods.

243
00:11:05,528 --> 00:11:07,980
She preferred the isolation.

244
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:12,344
Always the keen observer, she
learned to hunt and to track,

245
00:11:12,344 --> 00:11:14,768
to spy and to shoot.

246
00:11:14,768 --> 00:11:17,282
And through a series of fateful events,

247
00:11:17,282 --> 00:11:20,819
earned herself a companion
in the form of a bear,

248
00:11:20,819 --> 00:11:23,204
her own stolen trinket,

249
00:11:23,204 --> 00:11:24,037
(bear growling)

250
00:11:24,037 --> 00:11:25,013
to fight alongside her

251
00:11:25,013 --> 00:11:27,450
and protect her fiercely.

252
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:31,367
Also, he is adorable and
gives expert massages.

253
00:11:32,752 --> 00:11:33,894
Welcome back everyone.

254
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:35,221
So, know that you're a
little more affiliated

255
00:11:35,221 --> 00:11:38,431
with the characters, let's
get this party started.

256
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,474
So as a head's up, I wanna let you know,

257
00:11:40,474 --> 00:11:42,271
once again, we're waiting
for the charity elements

258
00:11:42,271 --> 00:11:44,379
of this stream to open up
again, since the big charity

259
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:45,495
that happened a couple weeks ago.

260
00:11:45,495 --> 00:11:48,381
Once we do, we're gonna
be taking donations,

261
00:11:48,381 --> 00:11:49,649
half to go to help run the channel,

262
00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:52,593
the other to donate to 826.

263
00:11:52,593 --> 00:11:55,569
Marisha will explain that
here in just a second.

264
00:11:55,569 --> 00:11:59,277
As a head's up, Ashley,
who plays our cleric, Pike,

265
00:11:59,277 --> 00:12:01,555
unfortunately couldn't
make it again this week,

266
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:03,643
because she's busy filming amazing stuff

267
00:12:03,643 --> 00:12:04,921
with her career being amazing.

268
00:12:04,921 --> 00:12:07,520
But she says she's sad she can't be here.

269
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,353
She loves you guys,

270
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:09,289
and as soon as Pike can
re-enter the campaign,

271
00:12:09,289 --> 00:12:10,888
hopefully in a couple weeks,

272
00:12:10,888 --> 00:12:13,772
all awesome gnomeness shall double.

273
00:12:13,772 --> 00:12:16,234
So also tonight, there was a goal to try

274
00:12:16,234 --> 00:12:18,497
and hit 1000 subscribers on the channel.

275
00:12:18,497 --> 00:12:20,433
So what we're gonna do is,
we only have 130 people

276
00:12:20,433 --> 00:12:21,712
to subscribe tonight.

277
00:12:21,712 --> 00:12:23,988
If we can get all 130 before
the show ends this evening,

278
00:12:23,988 --> 00:12:25,822
we're gonna do a random selection

279
00:12:25,822 --> 00:12:28,264
of a person within those
thousand subscribers

280
00:12:28,264 --> 00:12:31,416
to win a copy of the Player's
Handbook signed by all of us,

281
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:32,936
as well as a really, really cool image

282
00:12:32,936 --> 00:12:34,678
that was tweeted out earlier
by Geek &amp; Sundry,

283
00:12:34,678 --> 00:12:36,411
also signed by all of us.

284
00:12:36,411 --> 00:12:37,953
So, go ahead and pull your friends,

285
00:12:37,953 --> 00:12:39,191
see if we can get some more subscribers

286
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:40,954
before the show's out tonight, so

287
00:12:40,954 --> 00:12:42,760
hopefully that'll be fun.

288
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,618
So, Marisha, if you wanna go
ahead and explain a little bit

289
00:12:45,618 --> 00:12:48,990
about the charity 826 we'll be
plugging in the near future.

290
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:52,268
Yes, 826 LA is a non-profit
charity organization

291
00:12:52,268 --> 00:12:55,353
that helps kids though
the age of six to 18

292
00:12:55,353 --> 00:12:59,340
with their creative and
structural writing skills,

293
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:02,423
and they also help teachers and yeah.

294
00:13:03,412 --> 00:13:05,396
Good artsy creative things.

295
00:13:05,396 --> 00:13:07,750
So donate, and definitely
visit the Time Travel Mart.

296
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,583
SAM: Wait, can we donate?

297
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:10,060
MATT: Tonight we can't donate here.

298
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,179
MARISHA: We can't donate tonight yet?

299
00:13:11,179 --> 00:13:12,428
MATT: It's not available yet.

300
00:13:12,428 --> 00:13:13,261
Start saving your money.

301
00:13:13,261 --> 00:13:14,094
SAM: Not yet.

302
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,222
MARISHA: But you can still go to the
Time Travel Mart in Echo Park

303
00:13:17,222 --> 00:13:20,347
and you can also go to
their website, 826LA,

304
00:13:20,347 --> 00:13:21,818
and I'm sure you can donate through there

305
00:13:21,818 --> 00:13:22,651
if you want to do that.

306
00:13:22,651 --> 00:13:24,674
MATT: Yes, but we'll be getting
that going in the near future.

307
00:13:25,507 --> 00:13:26,340
So, anyway.

308
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,173
Let's go ahead and do a little recap

309
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:28,006
of what happened last week.

310
00:13:28,006 --> 00:13:30,139
So the party has been
hired by their friend,

311
00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:33,286
Arcanist Allura Vysoren,
in the city of Emon

312
00:13:33,286 --> 00:13:36,154
to head towards the
dwarven town of Kraghammer,

313
00:13:36,154 --> 00:13:37,662
as a good friend of hers,
and one of the members

314
00:13:37,662 --> 00:13:40,560
of the Council of
Tal'Dorei, has gone missing.

315
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,979
This, being a halfling paladin,
named Lady Kima of Vord,

316
00:13:44,979 --> 00:13:46,992
who was on a vision quest
as part of a pilgrimage

317
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,425
and was drawn towards some dark evil

318
00:13:49,425 --> 00:13:52,138
she said was manifesting
somewhere deep beneath Kraghammer

319
00:13:52,138 --> 00:13:54,111
and hadn't been heard from since.

320
00:13:54,111 --> 00:13:56,874
So the party was sent there
to go ahead and seek her.

321
00:13:56,874 --> 00:13:59,737
Upon arriving in Kraghammer,
shenanigans ensued.

322
00:13:59,737 --> 00:14:02,222
They made some friends, made some enemies,

323
00:14:02,222 --> 00:14:03,055
wandered the town.

324
00:14:03,055 --> 00:14:05,505
Brother, sisters, walked
around as if they were married.

325
00:14:05,505 --> 00:14:06,338
LAURA: No!

326
00:14:06,338 --> 00:14:08,109
(group laughs)

327
00:14:08,109 --> 00:14:10,630
MATT: Bears almost got into fights in rings.

328
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:13,196
And eventually the party made their way

329
00:14:13,196 --> 00:14:15,999
towards the bottom ring
of Kraghammer proper,

330
00:14:15,999 --> 00:14:18,655
talking to Lord Nostoc Greyspine, who is--

331
00:14:18,655 --> 00:14:20,884
ORION: That's right, Greyspine.

332
00:14:20,884 --> 00:14:22,264
MATT: Yes, Greyspine indeed.

333
00:14:22,264 --> 00:14:26,172
Who is the head of the Greyspine Mines

334
00:14:26,172 --> 00:14:27,245
at the bottom of Kraghammer,

335
00:14:27,245 --> 00:14:30,096
where supposedly this
paladin disappeared to.

336
00:14:30,096 --> 00:14:31,720
After having a conversation with him,

337
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,616
a bunch of goblins and ogres
began to spring from the mines

338
00:14:34,616 --> 00:14:36,244
and attacking the workers.

339
00:14:36,244 --> 00:14:39,082
The party swooped down to
aid, realized that the goblins

340
00:14:39,082 --> 00:14:41,024
and ogre's weren't
attacking, they were fleeing

341
00:14:41,024 --> 00:14:42,480
from something else,

342
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,829
of which emerging from
within the mines proper

343
00:14:44,829 --> 00:14:48,246
some strange naga-based
hydra-ish abomination.

344
00:14:48,246 --> 00:14:49,968
The party then proceeded to slaughter it,

345
00:14:49,968 --> 00:14:52,281
final blow dealt by
Scanlan via lightning bolt.

346
00:14:52,281 --> 00:14:53,716
SAM: Hi, Scanlan here, hi.

347
00:14:53,716 --> 00:14:54,734
MATT: Our resident gnome bard.

348
00:14:54,734 --> 00:14:55,596
TRAVIS: Yeah, you did!

349
00:14:55,596 --> 00:14:57,583
MATT: And that's where we pick up.

350
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,663
So, as all of you are
still riding the adrenaline

351
00:14:59,663 --> 00:15:02,499
of the battle, Scanlan feeling
the tingling in his fingers

352
00:15:02,499 --> 00:15:03,500
as the little bolts of
arcane energy kind of

353
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,034
(imitates electricity
crackling) spark throughout,

354
00:15:06,034 --> 00:15:08,039
the rest of the nearby workers and miners

355
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:09,936
slowly converge in and begin to

356
00:15:09,936 --> 00:15:11,627
walk up to the party.

357
00:15:11,627 --> 00:15:14,130
And someone starts, "That was
great, that was well done!

358
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,286
"Fantastic!

359
00:15:15,286 --> 00:15:16,276
"Where'd you learn that?"

360
00:15:16,276 --> 00:15:17,405
One of them comes up there,
"Ah, I could've done

361
00:15:17,405 --> 00:15:18,330
"better than that."

362
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:19,505
And they start just
shouting off at each other

363
00:15:19,505 --> 00:15:20,963
and pat each other on the back.

364
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:23,680
A few moments of this progresses before,

365
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,400
all of a sudden, there's a
hush comes about the crowd,

366
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,797
and you see about five or six Carvers

367
00:15:27,797 --> 00:15:29,155
pull their way through,

368
00:15:29,155 --> 00:15:31,014
Carvers being the guards of Kraghammer,

369
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:35,101
with Lord Nostoc Greyspine
himself stepping through.

370
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,798
He looks at the rest
of the group and goes,

371
00:15:37,631 --> 00:15:40,624
"All right, so you've certainly
proven yourselves in battle."

372
00:15:40,624 --> 00:15:42,589
ORION: Well, of course we have.

373
00:15:43,468 --> 00:15:45,056
I'm sorry.

374
00:15:45,056 --> 00:15:47,220
MATT: "I would like to continue this conversation

375
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,943
that we had back in my
office if you don't mind."

376
00:15:50,943 --> 00:15:52,444
He turns around and begins to walk back.

377
00:15:52,444 --> 00:15:54,336
MARISHA: Oh wait, Nostoc.

378
00:15:54,336 --> 00:15:55,614
He's not even listening,
he's just walking off.

379
00:15:55,614 --> 00:15:56,447
(group laughs)

380
00:15:56,447 --> 00:15:58,086
Yeah, mmm.

381
00:15:58,086 --> 00:15:58,919
Ooh, shall we turn and follow?

382
00:15:58,919 --> 00:15:59,752
LAURA: Are you still an eagle?

383
00:15:59,752 --> 00:16:00,602
Can you even talk to him?

384
00:16:00,602 --> 00:16:01,435
TALIESIN: Shouldn't you just go caw?

385
00:16:01,435 --> 00:16:03,983
MARISHA: Well I'm not an eagle.

386
00:16:03,983 --> 00:16:05,309
But I am still poisoned.

387
00:16:06,214 --> 00:16:08,374
LAURA: Oh, I can help you.

388
00:16:08,374 --> 00:16:09,658
MARISHA: Oh, that'd be great.

389
00:16:09,658 --> 00:16:10,525
LAURA: Yeah!

390
00:16:11,433 --> 00:16:13,744
LAURA: Hold on, I'm gonna go
up, and I'm gonna cast--

391
00:16:13,744 --> 00:16:14,740
SAM: Cast?

392
00:16:14,903 --> 00:16:15,736
Yeah, I can cast spells.

393
00:16:16,369 --> 00:16:17,342
SAM: You can cast?

394
00:16:17,342 --> 00:16:19,060
LAURA: I can.
I've got plenty o' spells.

395
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,371
LIAM: You can kill?

396
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,007
SAM: All right, fair enough.

397
00:16:23,007 --> 00:16:26,135
LAURA: I'm gonna cast Protection
from Poison on Keyleth.

398
00:16:26,135 --> 00:16:26,968
MATT: Okay.

399
00:16:26,968 --> 00:16:31,818
Essentially go ahead and make
a saving throw with advantage.

400
00:16:31,818 --> 00:16:34,208
This'll be Constitution.

401
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,638
MARISHA: I made the second one.

402
00:16:35,638 --> 00:16:36,471
MATT: What'd you roll?

403
00:16:36,471 --> 00:16:37,310
MARISHA: A 10.

404
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:41,890
Plus my constitution which
is two, three, thirteen.

405
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:42,723
MATT: So thirteen?

406
00:16:42,723 --> 00:16:43,556
MARISHA: Yes.

407
00:16:43,556 --> 00:16:44,389
MATT: That'd be enough.

408
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:45,222
So, after you finish casting the spell,

409
00:16:45,222 --> 00:16:47,643
you feel the poison leave
the rest of your body.

410
00:16:47,643 --> 00:16:49,794
You can kind of take a breath to yourself.

411
00:16:49,794 --> 00:16:51,471
The rest of the miners
kind of look about and

412
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:54,506
Awkwardly staring back at
Nostoc as he walks off,

413
00:16:54,506 --> 00:16:56,187
kind of looking back like, what

414
00:16:56,187 --> 00:16:57,073
"Are you gonna go?

415
00:16:57,073 --> 00:16:57,906
"Talk to him?"

416
00:16:57,906 --> 00:16:59,024
SAM: Yeah, I guess we should go follow him.

417
00:16:59,024 --> 00:17:00,304
TALIESIN: We have two very important questions.

418
00:17:00,304 --> 00:17:01,423
GROG: Can't we look in the
hole a little bit more.

419
00:17:01,423 --> 00:17:02,868
ORION: No Grog, we need to go do this.

420
00:17:02,868 --> 00:17:04,729
LAURA: We're gonna go in the hole
in just a minute, Grog.

421
00:17:04,729 --> 00:17:05,561
ORION: Then you can smash, you'll be fine.

422
00:17:05,561 --> 00:17:06,395
TRAVIS: You promise?

423
00:17:06,395 --> 00:17:07,457
LIAM: You did that last night.

424
00:17:07,457 --> 00:17:09,553
We need to take care of business.

425
00:17:09,553 --> 00:17:10,460
Let's go talk to the man.

426
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,029
I'm sure it's going to
lead back to the mines.

427
00:17:13,029 --> 00:17:13,862
MARISHA: To the hole.

428
00:17:13,862 --> 00:17:14,694
LIAM: Yes, to the hole.

429
00:17:14,694 --> 00:17:15,546
Everything's back to the hole.

430
00:17:15,546 --> 00:17:16,771
SAM: Percy, do you have something
to say before we go?

431
00:17:16,771 --> 00:17:18,073
TALIESIN: Well, this is good.

432
00:17:18,073 --> 00:17:19,324
We have to find out what that was,

433
00:17:19,324 --> 00:17:20,621
and we have to see if
he'll finally give us

434
00:17:20,621 --> 00:17:21,733
some of that ale,

435
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:23,453
I think are the two most important things.

436
00:17:23,453 --> 00:17:24,566
LAURA: It was wine, I believe.

437
00:17:24,566 --> 00:17:26,121
SAM: No, it was bloody, bloody beer.

438
00:17:26,121 --> 00:17:27,457
LAURA: Bloodline.
Bloody wine, blood wine.

439
00:17:27,457 --> 00:17:29,027
TRAVIS: Bloodier, ale.
Beerwine.

440
00:17:29,027 --> 00:17:30,290
MATT: It was delicious is what it was.

441
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,486
TRAVIS: It was really good.

442
00:17:31,486 --> 00:17:32,807
LAURA: Let's go talk to Nostoc.

443
00:17:32,807 --> 00:17:33,640
SAM: Let's follow him, let's follow him.

444
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,349
TALIESIN: Okay, this is what's important.

445
00:17:35,349 --> 00:17:37,231
MATT: All right, so as you head back
to the ramp that heads up

446
00:17:37,231 --> 00:17:41,572
from the mine enclosure itself
to the top of the realm,

447
00:17:41,572 --> 00:17:45,843
which is where the Greyspine
Industries mining facility is,

448
00:17:45,843 --> 00:17:47,125
you are brought into the building again,

449
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,047
brought back to Nostoc's office,

450
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:49,880
in which he's not sitting,

451
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,075
he's kind of pacing behind his desk,

452
00:17:52,075 --> 00:17:53,413
waiting for you as you approach.

453
00:17:53,413 --> 00:17:55,191
As you enter the room, he
stops pacing, turns around,

454
00:17:55,191 --> 00:17:57,351
puts his hand on the desk, and says,

455
00:17:57,351 --> 00:18:00,073
Please, enter and close
the doors behind you.

456
00:18:00,073 --> 00:18:01,971
(loud thud)

457
00:18:01,971 --> 00:18:03,861
ORION: Sorry, I didn't mean to
slam the door like that.

458
00:18:03,861 --> 00:18:06,838
(group laughs)

459
00:18:06,838 --> 00:18:08,307
MATT: "A flatulent dragonborn, eh?"

460
00:18:08,307 --> 00:18:09,716
(group laughs)

461
00:18:09,716 --> 00:18:10,549
MATT: "All right."

462
00:18:13,518 --> 00:18:16,873
So as you close the -
(laughs)

463
00:18:16,873 --> 00:18:18,472
Tiberius.

464
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,464
(Orion clears throat comically)

465
00:18:20,464 --> 00:18:22,414
SAM: Sir Greyspine.

466
00:18:22,414 --> 00:18:23,597
Lord Greyspine?

467
00:18:23,597 --> 00:18:24,430
Mr. Greyspine?

468
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:25,793
MATT: "Lord Greyspine is fine."

469
00:18:25,793 --> 00:18:26,800
SAM: Lord Greyspine, yes.

470
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,885
Why have you summoned us here?

471
00:18:27,885 --> 00:18:30,807
Is it to tell us information
about what just came out

472
00:18:30,807 --> 00:18:32,297
of your mine, I hope.

473
00:18:32,297 --> 00:18:33,868
MATT: "Well let's be clear."

474
00:18:33,868 --> 00:18:36,399
"We dwarves don't need help from outsiders.

475
00:18:36,399 --> 00:18:37,858
"We can handle our own business just fine."

476
00:18:37,858 --> 00:18:38,691
LAURA: Of course.

477
00:18:40,068 --> 00:18:41,893
MARISHA: Speaking of outsiders, you wouldn't happen

478
00:18:41,893 --> 00:18:44,726
to have seen a Lady Kima, would you?

479
00:18:44,726 --> 00:18:47,698
MATT: "As what the discussion
was based on previously,

480
00:18:47,698 --> 00:18:49,137
"you're searching for
her, and last we saw her,

481
00:18:49,137 --> 00:18:49,970
She went down into the mine."

482
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,163
LAURA: We already talked about that, Keyleth.

483
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:52,286
TRAVIS: Yep, we did.

484
00:18:52,286 --> 00:18:54,681
LIAM: They don't like her,
she was a troublemaker

485
00:18:54,681 --> 00:18:56,318
and she went in.

486
00:18:56,318 --> 00:18:57,436
TRAVIS: You're an eagle.

487
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,318
LAURA: She's in the mine.

488
00:18:59,318 --> 00:19:00,703
We'll go in and find her.

489
00:19:00,703 --> 00:19:01,536
Right?

490
00:19:01,536 --> 00:19:02,901
Lord Greyspine?

491
00:19:02,901 --> 00:19:03,734
MATT: "You're welcome to.

492
00:19:03,734 --> 00:19:05,054
"As far as I know, she's
down there somewhere.

493
00:19:05,054 --> 00:19:06,404
"Hopefully still in one piece."

494
00:19:06,404 --> 00:19:07,780
LAURA: While we're there, would
you like us to take care

495
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,547
of any other problems?

496
00:19:09,547 --> 00:19:11,276
MATT: "Getting to that.

497
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:14,132
"You see these small
intrusions have been bad

"for meeting our quotas with the
Bronzegrip metal warehouse

499

"Employees have been forced to

"collapse a non-negotiable
portion of our tunnels

502

"to prevent incursions like this.

503

"Without my approval.

504
00:19:27,674 --> 00:19:31,236
"And this is a pattern
I wish to stop at once.

505
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:34,153
"Thus, I have a proposition for you.

506
00:19:37,025 --> 00:19:40,241
"Now, I will give you
free reign to our mines.

"I shall get the proper approvals
to make sure no Carvers

the city's lower ring.

"And I will contract you
to delve past our tunnels

"and investigate the
source of these creatures,

"where they come from, where they live,

512

"Eliminate them.

"For this, I will reward
you with not a trifle sum.

"Plus 250 gold per beast scalp

518
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,269
LAURA: Ooh, I like this.

519
00:20:15,269 --> 00:20:17,793
ORION: Grog, this seems like a
wonderful job, doesn't it?

520
00:20:17,793 --> 00:20:19,518
SAM: Money is wonderful.

521
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:20,577
We like money.

522
00:20:22,394 --> 00:20:25,356
But we've been charged to find Lady Kima.

523
00:20:25,356 --> 00:20:28,208
We need assurances that we will find her

524
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:30,514
or at least some evidence
of her in the mines.

525
00:20:30,514 --> 00:20:32,419
MATT: "The brazen halfling bitch went in there

526
00:20:32,419 --> 00:20:34,208
"without my approval and
wandered into the mines,

527

"not to be seen.

528
00:20:36,491 --> 00:20:38,932
"So if she is down there,
I hope she's in one piece.

529

"I can't guarantee it.

530
00:20:40,692 --> 00:20:42,851
"But if there's any place to
find her, that's probably it."

531
00:20:42,851 --> 00:20:45,119
LIAM: We're the group of adventurers for you.

532
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,431
I don't know if you've heard

533
00:20:46,431 --> 00:20:49,085
of the heroes Emon, who just recently-

534
00:20:49,085 --> 00:20:50,673
I'm sure you've heard something.

535
00:20:50,673 --> 00:20:52,318
Word travels fast.

536
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:53,553
MATT: "Not beneath this mountain, it doesn't,

537
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:55,046
of human closers."

538
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:58,386
LIAM: We've just done a lot of
good to the ruler of Emon.

539
00:20:58,386 --> 00:20:59,219
MATT: "Great.

540
00:20:59,219 --> 00:21:00,960
How does that help us dwarves?"

541
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,367
ORION: We're saying we
are going to help you, too.

542
00:21:04,261 --> 00:21:06,274
And everything will be fine,
and we'll all be happy.

543
00:21:06,274 --> 00:21:09,403
LAURA: Well, we've discovered, in
our past adventures, however,

544
00:21:09,403 --> 00:21:10,986
is that every realm

545
00:21:13,362 --> 00:21:16,441
seems to be having trouble with
the same sort of creatures,

546
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,382
coming up from the Underdark perhaps?

547
00:21:19,382 --> 00:21:21,578
LIAM: All we're saying is,
help us help you.

548
00:21:21,578 --> 00:21:24,387
What exactly have
you seen before this day?

549
00:21:24,387 --> 00:21:26,218
More of the same? Or other creatures?

550
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:28,021
MATT: He sits back for a second.

551
00:21:28,031 --> 00:21:30,256
"The types of creatures, I do not know.

552
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,832
"I mostly deal with the business

553
00:21:32,832 --> 00:21:35,102
"and just know that there's
some bullshite going on

554

"down in the mines.

555
00:21:36,988 --> 00:21:39,063
"You could ask our foreman, Hieris.

"He's dealt with the cleanup each time

557

"we've had an incursion like this,

558

"so if anyone has information
on what these creatures are,

559
00:21:43,987 --> 00:21:46,330
"he'd be the one to talk to."

560
00:21:47,163 --> 00:21:48,439
LIAM: Sorry, what was his name again?

561
00:21:48,439 --> 00:21:49,662
MATT, SAM, LAURA: Hieris.

562
00:21:50,278 --> 00:21:51,945
MATT: "He's a foreman at the mine proper."

563
00:21:51,945 --> 00:21:52,778
LAURA: All right.

564
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:56,377
TALIESIN: I think this seems like the
sort of job we'd want to take.

565
00:21:56,377 --> 00:21:57,450
LAURA, ORION: Yes.

566
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,059
TRAVIS: Will we get paid for the
monsters and creatures

567
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:01,991
we've already slayed?

568
00:22:01,991 --> 00:22:05,026
MATT: "This deal was not sewn in yet, so no."

569
00:22:05,026 --> 00:22:05,859
TRAVIS: Oh.

570
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:07,528
MATT: "But we thank you for your aid."

571
00:22:07,528 --> 00:22:10,645
PERCY: It is customary in our
culture to seal a deal

572
00:22:10,645 --> 00:22:12,432
with a drink.

573
00:22:12,432 --> 00:22:14,430
TALIESIN: As I think you are all aware.

574
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,212
LAURA: Truly, truly.

575
00:22:16,212 --> 00:22:18,652
LIAM: See, I wasn't just fucking
with you last week.

576
00:22:18,652 --> 00:22:19,967
(group laughs)

577
00:22:19,967 --> 00:22:21,242
That's a thing we do.

578
00:22:21,741 --> 00:22:24,046
TALIESIN: And since we are about to risk our lives...

579
00:22:24,046 --> 00:22:25,677
TRAVIS: I forgot you did that.

580
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,070
MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

581
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,703
TALIESIN: Yes! Happily.

582
00:22:29,092 --> 00:22:31,099
TRAVIS: Roll good, it's the first one.

583
00:22:34,749 --> 00:22:35,742
LIAM: Come on, Percy!

584
00:22:35,742 --> 00:22:36,575
TALIESIN: 14.

585
00:22:36,575 --> 00:22:37,408
LAURA: Oh.

586
00:22:37,408 --> 00:22:38,241
SAM: It's pretty good.

587
00:22:38,241 --> 00:22:39,241
Not great.

588
00:22:40,164 --> 00:22:43,854
MATT: You can see this long,
distant, angry, dwarven,

589
00:22:43,854 --> 00:22:45,354
mistrusting stare.

590
00:22:46,338 --> 00:22:51,013
Rubs his chin, his well-kept,
blackened beard and goes,

591
00:22:51,013 --> 00:22:53,751
"Huh, but a sip, as it was a gift."

592
00:22:53,751 --> 00:22:54,584
LAURA: Yes!

593
00:22:57,091 --> 00:22:58,191
SAM: (laughs) We'll take it.

594
00:22:58,191 --> 00:23:01,176
He pulls the ale barrel
which you guys provided,

595
00:23:01,176 --> 00:23:04,176
sets it on the side of his
desk with the same spigot

596
00:23:04,176 --> 00:23:06,241
that you had placed in when
you presented it earlier

597
00:23:06,241 --> 00:23:07,691
and says, "Take a bit."

598
00:23:08,531 --> 00:23:10,153
"A bit."

599
00:23:10,153 --> 00:23:12,218
LAURA: (whispering) Put some in a bottle.

600
00:23:12,456 --> 00:23:14,310
ORION: We have to save some for those guards.

601
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,451
LIAM: Let me take care of it.

602
00:23:15,451 --> 00:23:16,481
I'll pour everyone a glass.

603
00:23:16,481 --> 00:23:17,990
LIAM: Oh, thank you, brother.

604
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:22,924
I take my empty water flask
that I emptied out before,

605
00:23:22,924 --> 00:23:26,453
and am smiling and pouring glasses

606
00:23:26,453 --> 00:23:29,754
and also squirting a little
bit here and there as I want.

607
00:23:29,754 --> 00:23:32,012
I start to just play a
little ditty on the flute.

608
00:23:32,012 --> 00:23:34,590
I thought we could accompany
our sip with a little bit

609
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:37,317
of music, not to distract you, just to--

610
00:23:37,317 --> 00:23:39,052
(group laughs)

611
00:23:39,052 --> 00:23:41,481
just to sort of accompany us.

612
00:23:41,481 --> 00:23:44,203
MATT: His nose squints at the sound.

613
00:23:44,203 --> 00:23:47,037
(SAM imitates a jaunty flute)

614
00:23:47,037 --> 00:23:50,150
MATT: "Gnomish tunes aren't
to my ears and liking."

615
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,209
However, you do get an inspiration dice.

616
00:23:51,209 --> 00:23:52,042
LAURA: Yay.

617
00:23:53,296 --> 00:23:56,667
MATT: All right, so go ahead and
make a - (laughs)

618
00:23:56,667 --> 00:23:58,534
Make a sleight of hand check on this.

619
00:23:58,534 --> 00:23:59,940
LIAM: Okay.

620
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,773
That's what we do, right?

621
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:01,606
LAURA: Roll well.

622
00:24:02,439 --> 00:24:03,944
Here we go.

623
00:24:03,944 --> 00:24:05,177
LAURA AND LIAM: Oh, no.

624
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:06,837
SAM: You have inspiration dice.

625
00:24:06,837 --> 00:24:08,518
TALIESIN: Inspiration dice are d8?

626
00:24:08,518 --> 00:24:10,410
MATT: Yep, you add a d8 to it as well.

627
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:12,241
LIAM: Okay, and I can add a d8 to this?

628
00:24:12,241 --> 00:24:12,956
MATT: Correct.

629
00:24:12,956 --> 00:24:15,181
TALIESIN: The ale is that good.

630
00:24:15,181 --> 00:24:16,014
LIAM: Oh good.

631
00:24:16,014 --> 00:24:16,960
Now I'm at 19.

632
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,793
(Travis groans in relief)

633
00:24:17,793 --> 00:24:18,707
Hey.

634
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,071
MATT: As he's listening to the gnomish music

635
00:24:20,071 --> 00:24:21,704
and kind of pushing it
away with his hands, like,

636
00:24:21,704 --> 00:24:23,911
"Stop, I don't- no.

637
00:24:24,567 --> 00:24:26,217
"I appreciate it, but I don't."

638
00:24:26,217 --> 00:24:28,510
SAM: All right, there's not accounting for taste.

639
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:31,596
MATT: As you do that, your
wineskin goes to full.

640
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:32,429
(imitates liquid sloshing)

641
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,326
Swollen to its brim.

642
00:24:34,479 --> 00:24:35,898
You switch over to one of the cups,

643
00:24:35,898 --> 00:24:37,032
you pass around the drinks.

644
00:24:37,032 --> 00:24:40,282
All of you manage to get
your drinks passed around.

645
00:24:40,282 --> 00:24:41,115
LAURA: Huzzah!

646
00:24:41,115 --> 00:24:42,173
MATT: "To a contract!"

647
00:24:42,173 --> 00:24:43,166
TRAVIS: Aye! Huzzah!

648
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:44,329
TALIESIN: To a contract.

649
00:24:44,329 --> 00:24:45,255
MARISHA: Contracts.

650
00:24:45,255 --> 00:24:46,498
SAM: L'chaim!

651
00:24:46,961 --> 00:24:48,436
MARISHA: Love contracts.

652
00:24:48,436 --> 00:24:49,560
LIAM: Is that Draconian?

653
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,744
SAM: It's Gnomish.

654
00:24:50,744 --> 00:24:52,628
TALIESIN: To risking our lives. For money.

655
00:24:52,628 --> 00:24:54,399
LAURA: How old is Nostoc?

656
00:24:54,399 --> 00:24:55,562
Just out of curiosity.

657
00:24:56,018 --> 00:24:57,461
MATT: It's hard to tell.

658
00:24:57,461 --> 00:24:59,197
Dwarves live quite a long time.

659
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:00,761
He would be equivalent
to like a human forties.

660
00:25:00,761 --> 00:25:03,384
Dwarven time, somewhere
in his mid-hundreds.

661
00:25:03,384 --> 00:25:05,447
MARISHA: Smells like its been in the
barrel for a hundred years.

662
00:25:05,447 --> 00:25:06,840
ORION: It has been.

663
00:25:07,336 --> 00:25:08,799
LAURA: This is excellent.

664
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,404
LIAM: Tastes like two buck Chuck.

665
00:25:10,404 --> 00:25:11,724
(group laughs)

666
00:25:11,724 --> 00:25:14,449
ORION: Oh, I know him from Quimdendale.

667
00:25:14,449 --> 00:25:18,532
TRAVIS: What do you know of a
Ballsac up in the tavern?

668
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,483
MATT: "I'm sorry, what?"

669
00:25:21,483 --> 00:25:22,544
TRAVIS: Do I have that right?

670
00:25:22,544 --> 00:25:23,645
LAURA: Ball, ball -

671
00:25:23,645 --> 00:25:24,478
MARISHA: Balgus.

672
00:25:24,478 --> 00:25:25,356
GROUP: Balgus.

673
00:25:25,356 --> 00:25:28,177
MATT: "Ah, Balgus, that's the brand
of what you brought me."

674
00:25:28,177 --> 00:25:31,008
SAM: You know what, I think we
asked about him last time.

675
00:25:31,008 --> 00:25:32,117
LAURA: I think we did.

676
00:25:32,117 --> 00:25:33,910
ORION: Also, may we take a short rest

677
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:35,628
before we leave this facility?

678
00:25:35,628 --> 00:25:37,541
MARISHA: Yes, could we do that?

679
00:25:37,987 --> 00:25:39,670
Is this considered a short rest?

680
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,628
LAURA: Oh yeah, that actually would be good.

681
00:25:41,628 --> 00:25:43,357
MATT: If you'd like to do that,

682
00:25:43,357 --> 00:25:45,244
that would just be taking
a short rest outside,

683
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:46,638
probably not in the office proper.

684
00:25:46,638 --> 00:25:48,000
LAURA: Understandable.

685
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,961
MATT: You can leave and just sit down

686
00:25:49,961 --> 00:25:51,274
and get some rest.

687
00:25:51,274 --> 00:25:53,501
LAURA: When we take a rest, can
I look for Hieris?

688
00:25:53,501 --> 00:25:54,334
MATT: You can as well.

689
00:25:54,334 --> 00:25:55,989
So, while you guys are
taking a short rest,

690
00:25:55,989 --> 00:25:57,545
you're able to use any of your hit dice

691
00:25:57,545 --> 00:25:58,656
to heal up naturally.

692
00:25:58,656 --> 00:26:00,565
TRAVIS: We don't naturally heal up?

693
00:26:00,565 --> 00:26:02,242
MATT: That is your natural healing.

694
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:04,805
Not to full.

695
00:26:04,805 --> 00:26:06,172
It's a continuation, Grog.

696
00:26:06,172 --> 00:26:08,338
SAM: I will sing a song of rest.

697
00:26:08,338 --> 00:26:10,932
And it goes a little something like,

698
00:26:10,932 --> 00:26:13,895
♫ Scanlan make you feel good ♫

699
00:26:13,895 --> 00:26:17,456
♫ Scanlan make you feel real good ♫

700
00:26:17,456 --> 00:26:19,023
ORION: Oh, I feel so good.

701
00:26:19,023 --> 00:26:21,513
SAM: No wait, you get an extra d6
on all your heals.

702
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,912
TRAVIS: I appreciate the slow jam.

703
00:26:23,912 --> 00:26:26,619
MATT: Yeah, on every hit dice,
you get an extra d6.

704
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,737
TRAVIS: R. Kelly would agree.

705
00:26:29,737 --> 00:26:31,898
(Matt laughs)

706
00:26:35,097 --> 00:26:37,189
LAURA: I didn't take any hit points.

707
00:26:37,189 --> 00:26:38,766
I'm at full health.

708
00:26:38,766 --> 00:26:41,915
MATT: So you got a slow jam just
for the sake of the slow jam.

709
00:26:41,915 --> 00:26:43,723
LAURA: That's right.
And it was great.

710
00:26:43,723 --> 00:26:46,084
MATT: All right, roll an investigate check.

711
00:26:46,084 --> 00:26:47,825
ORION: It feels good.
Real good.

712
00:26:47,825 --> 00:26:48,662
LAURA: Okay.

713
00:26:48,662 --> 00:26:50,275
Oh, 25.

714
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,434
MATT: A brief discussion with a few

715
00:26:52,434 --> 00:26:54,675
of the other wandering
dwarf miners that are

716
00:26:54,675 --> 00:26:57,405
in the outskirts of the
buildings' facilities.

717
00:26:57,405 --> 00:26:59,477
Eventually it leads you
over to what is a small,

718
00:26:59,477 --> 00:27:03,148
secondary building
maybe 200 yards off

719
00:27:03,148 --> 00:27:04,915
from the main property.

720
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:07,175
That apparently is where Hieris resides

721
00:27:07,175 --> 00:27:10,296
and keeps watch over the
entire establishment.

722
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:11,510
LIAM: I've tagged along.

723
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:12,883
LAURA: Knock knock knock.

724
00:27:12,883 --> 00:27:15,497
MATT: All right, the rest of you going with her?

725
00:27:15,497 --> 00:27:17,027
SAM: Yeah, we'll go with her.

726
00:27:17,027 --> 00:27:19,635
MATT: Why not! Why split the party?

727
00:27:19,635 --> 00:27:21,793
So the the group makes their way over

728
00:27:21,793 --> 00:27:24,085
to the outskirts of the building.

729
00:27:24,085 --> 00:27:26,927
Opens up and a very nice, 
portly looking dwarf

730
00:27:26,927 --> 00:27:30,092
with a big tuft of a chinstrap beard.

731
00:27:30,554 --> 00:27:32,636
Big reddish, ruddy nose.

732
00:27:32,636 --> 00:27:33,999
Leather apron on.

733
00:27:33,999 --> 00:27:35,801
And he opens the door.

734
00:27:35,801 --> 00:27:36,971
"Aye, hello!

735
00:27:36,971 --> 00:27:37,807
Nice to meet you.

736
00:27:37,807 --> 00:27:39,043
What can I do for ye?"

737
00:27:39,043 --> 00:27:40,466
LAURA: Hi. You must be Hieris?

738
00:27:40,466 --> 00:27:41,450
MATT: "I am, I am.

739
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:42,914
Foreman of this here fine mine."

740
00:27:42,914 --> 00:27:44,325
LAURA: Wonderful to meet you.

741
00:27:44,325 --> 00:27:46,188
I've heard wonderful things about you.

742
00:27:46,188 --> 00:27:47,981
MATT: "Oh, have you! From who?"

743
00:27:47,981 --> 00:27:50,294
LAURA: Uh, from Lord Greyspine himself.

744
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:52,157
MATT: "Really? Oh. All right.

745
00:27:52,157 --> 00:27:54,689
"Well, how can I be of service?"

746
00:27:54,689 --> 00:27:56,833
LAURA: We were curious.

747
00:27:56,833 --> 00:27:59,476
I'm sure you witnessed all
of those wonderful goblins

748
00:27:59,476 --> 00:28:02,056
and trolls and other nonsense
coming out of the mine.

749
00:28:02,056 --> 00:28:04,014
MATT: "Aye. Nasty lot. 
It always makes my weeks

750
00:28:04,014 --> 00:28:05,553
"that much more interesting."

751
00:28:05,553 --> 00:28:08,046
LAURA: Weeks? So this has been
happening for quite a while?

752
00:28:08,046 --> 00:28:09,932
MATT: "Unfortunately, at least five or six."

753
00:28:09,932 --> 00:28:12,883
LAURA: And what kind of monsters
have you been dealing with?

754
00:28:12,883 --> 00:28:14,333
MATT: "Terrible kinds."

755
00:28:14,333 --> 00:28:16,718
He starts rubbing his
chin for a little and goes,

756
00:28:16,718 --> 00:28:19,148
"We generally deal with
the occasional goblin den

757
00:28:19,148 --> 00:28:21,411
"we stumble across when
opening new tunnels.

758
00:28:21,411 --> 00:28:23,340
"That's part of the norm.

759
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,749
"Other nasty underground beasties.

760
00:28:25,749 --> 00:28:27,754
"However, over this past few weeks,

761
00:28:27,754 --> 00:28:30,120
"we've seen some real
nightmarish things slither

762
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,693
"out of the shadows.

763
00:28:31,693 --> 00:28:34,755
"Many goblins stitched together,

764
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:37,124
"like some kind of ball
of screaming green lint.

765
00:28:37,124 --> 00:28:37,957
SAM: Ooh, god.

766
00:28:37,957 --> 00:28:39,809
MATT: "Slimes and oozes that would mutate

767
00:28:39,809 --> 00:28:42,338
"and change color rapidly
before seeming to dissolve

768
00:28:42,338 --> 00:28:43,282
"on their own.

769
00:28:43,282 --> 00:28:45,701
"Unstable-looking really, in their form."

770
00:28:45,701 --> 00:28:47,533
SAM: Like a goblin centipede?

771
00:28:47,533 --> 00:28:48,836
(Laura, Liam, Travis laugh)

772
00:28:48,836 --> 00:28:50,352
MATT: "If you will, aye aye."

773
00:28:50,352 --> 00:28:53,108
ORION: Sounds more like some
type of necromancy magic.

774
00:28:53,108 --> 00:28:55,441
MATT: "Perhaps, but they're not undead, per se.

775
00:28:55,441 --> 00:28:56,680
"They're still alive.

776
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,803
"At least from what we can tell.

777
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:01,475
"Whatever agony face them
in their physical form.

778
00:29:01,475 --> 00:29:02,943
ORION: Oh, that's even worse.

779
00:29:02,943 --> 00:29:05,481
MATT: "We even had one brief
run-in with what looked

780
00:29:05,481 --> 00:29:07,937
"like a duergar that had
swollen and sprouted eyes

781
00:29:07,937 --> 00:29:09,703
"and mouths all across his body.
That was a sight."

782
00:29:09,703 --> 00:29:10,951
SAM: What's a duergar?

783
00:29:10,951 --> 00:29:12,206
LIAM: That's a dark dwarf.

784
00:29:12,206 --> 00:29:13,415
They're little fuckers, those are.

785
00:29:13,415 --> 00:29:14,896
MATT: "Aye, duergar."

786
00:29:14,896 --> 00:29:15,904
And he spits to the side.

787
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,799
"Filthy lost souls.

788
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:19,913
"Dwarves of old that
turned to a darker god.

789
00:29:19,913 --> 00:29:22,532
"Thankfully, they live far
beneath the mountains,

790
00:29:22,532 --> 00:29:25,158
"and usually far north
enough to not worry about it.

791
00:29:25,158 --> 00:29:27,725
"But one of them found its way up here,

792
00:29:27,725 --> 00:29:30,807
"in this strange, awful, maw-covered form.

793
00:29:30,807 --> 00:29:32,380
"It was terrifying.

794
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,762
"And the smell!

795
00:29:33,762 --> 00:29:34,595
"Oh ho ho!

796
00:29:36,131 --> 00:29:39,411
"Anyway, we've even seen a
few creatures from the surface

797
00:29:39,411 --> 00:29:41,649
"that normally aren't
found down here as well,

798
00:29:41,649 --> 00:29:42,687
"which is strange.

799
00:29:42,687 --> 00:29:44,396
"They don't wander down.

800
00:29:44,396 --> 00:29:45,997
"Something's bringing them.

801
00:29:45,997 --> 00:29:47,040
"Weirdest thing."

802
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,282
"Oh! And I just heard we
had some weird,

803
00:29:49,282 --> 00:29:51,996
many-headed serpent thing that
just got killed down there.

804
00:29:51,996 --> 00:29:53,642
LAURA: Oh, we just killed one of those.

805
00:29:53,642 --> 00:29:55,143
MATT: "That was you!"

806
00:29:55,143 --> 00:29:55,976
LAURA: Yes!

807
00:29:55,976 --> 00:29:57,711
TRAVIS: Our hero is right over here.

808
00:29:57,711 --> 00:29:58,962
SAM: (clears throat) Hi.

809
00:29:58,962 --> 00:30:01,148
(group laughs)

810
00:30:01,148 --> 00:30:03,431
MATT: And he steps onto his back
leg, shifting his weight,

811
00:30:03,431 --> 00:30:05,263
and cocks an awkward eyebrow.

812
00:30:05,263 --> 00:30:06,787
"Really?"

813
00:30:06,787 --> 00:30:09,370
SAM: I'm really strong for my age.

814
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:10,898
ORION: We were all surprised.

815
00:30:10,898 --> 00:30:13,063
TALIESIN: We're as surprised as anybody.

816
00:30:13,063 --> 00:30:14,450
TRAVIS: Fearsome Scanlan.

817
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:16,945
SAM: Actually, Hieris,
I have a question for you.

818
00:30:16,945 --> 00:30:18,638
You know the mines very well, yes?

819
00:30:18,638 --> 00:30:19,596
MATT: "Aye, I do."

820
00:30:22,423 --> 00:30:24,833
SAM: Far from asking you to draw us a map,

821
00:30:24,833 --> 00:30:29,183
are there any tunnels or
directions that we should avoid

822
00:30:29,183 --> 00:30:31,362
or particularly head towards?

823
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:33,766
Anything that we should look for in terms

824
00:30:33,766 --> 00:30:36,082
of traps or tricks?

825
00:30:36,082 --> 00:30:37,503
MATT: "Not within our mines.

826
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:39,676
"They're usually well-guarded.
Or, they were."

827
00:30:39,676 --> 00:30:41,970
ORION: Also, do you have a map?

828
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:43,033
MATT: "Of the mines?

829
00:30:43,033 --> 00:30:43,866
"Yeah, I do."

830
00:30:43,866 --> 00:30:44,699
ORION: Wonderful.

831
00:30:44,699 --> 00:30:47,152
MATT: He starts going through his notes here.

832
00:30:47,152 --> 00:30:48,394
ORION: I'll take that.

833
00:30:48,394 --> 00:30:50,300
SAM: That's where we're going, right?

834
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,141
TRAVIS: We're goin' in the hole.

835
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:54,620
MATT: It's kinda haphazardly
scrawled across a piece

836
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,910
of parchment, but he hands it over to you.

837
00:30:56,910 --> 00:31:00,727
MATT: And he says, "So that's the
front part of the mines.

838
00:31:01,923 --> 00:31:06,481
"Unfortunately, half of our
tunnels have been

839
00:31:06,481 --> 00:31:09,443
"relinquished to close off
some of these beasties

840
00:31:09,443 --> 00:31:11,760
"coming through, so we're
gonna have to recarve portions

841
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,495
"of the mine as we progress forward.

842
00:31:13,495 --> 00:31:16,060
"Kind of starting at
square one best we can.

843
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:19,474
"But that at least is what
we're currently working with.

844
00:31:19,474 --> 00:31:21,451
"There is a subterranean level as well.

845
00:31:21,451 --> 00:31:23,701
"We have an elevator inside

846
00:31:23,701 --> 00:31:27,462
"that brings the various
mine carts to and from."

847
00:31:27,462 --> 00:31:30,322
LAURA: Is there a particular area on that map

848
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:33,705
that most of the baddies
seem to be coming from?

849
00:31:33,705 --> 00:31:35,099
MATT: "No, we've closed it off each time."

850
00:31:35,099 --> 00:31:36,633
LAURA: Just kind of everywhere?

851
00:31:36,633 --> 00:31:38,376
MATT: "Oh no, we've had a few
tunnels they've come through,

852
00:31:38,376 --> 00:31:40,023
"but we've managed to collapse those

853
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,975
"and make sure they're
not coming through again.

854
00:31:41,975 --> 00:31:45,922
LIAM: And we noticed the, I believed
it was the naga we fought,

855
00:31:45,922 --> 00:31:49,930
it seemed to have several
extra heads stitched on.

856
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:52,032
Have you no knowledge of these creatures?

857
00:31:52,032 --> 00:31:54,092
It seems very odd.

858
00:31:54,092 --> 00:31:57,364
Is there any connection in
dwarven history or past?

859
00:31:57,364 --> 00:31:58,885
Or this is totally out of the blue?

860
00:31:58,885 --> 00:32:00,611
MATT: "No no, not to my knowledge, at least.

861
00:32:00,611 --> 00:32:03,056
"I mean, most beasts we
find are in one piece,

862
00:32:03,056 --> 00:32:04,806
"not several together.

863
00:32:05,272 --> 00:32:07,134
"It's a bit disturbing to be honest.

864
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:09,824
"I told my nephew about it
and he was crying for hours."

865
00:32:09,824 --> 00:32:11,077
LAURA and MARISHA: Oh.

866
00:32:11,077 --> 00:32:11,880
ORION: (laughs)

867
00:32:12,323 --> 00:32:13,785
TRAVIS: Do any of the beasts go back into them?

868
00:32:13,785 --> 00:32:16,249
MATT: "Oh no, we've killed them
as they come out each time."

869
00:32:16,249 --> 00:32:18,763
Right, they don't take anything back.

870
00:32:18,763 --> 00:32:20,506
MATT: "Not from what I've seen, no."

871
00:32:20,506 --> 00:32:24,457
MARISHA: Hieris, do you know if
there's any other entrances

872
00:32:24,457 --> 00:32:26,218
into the mine?

873
00:32:26,218 --> 00:32:28,556
Any old secret tunnels,
something that someone

874
00:32:28,556 --> 00:32:29,779
could be using to get in?

875
00:32:29,779 --> 00:32:31,914
MATT: "Not to the mine, this is
all proprietary.

876
00:32:31,914 --> 00:32:35,076
"This is the business we run,
so we don't have any internal

877
00:32:35,076 --> 00:32:36,390
"or secret entrances.

878
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:38,792
"That would leave us open
to a sort of a thief

879
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:40,554
to come in and steal our mithril."

880
00:32:40,907 --> 00:32:42,762
LIAM: And what's security like on the mine?

881
00:32:42,762 --> 00:32:44,479
Is there any chance
someone could've slipped in

882
00:32:44,479 --> 00:32:46,965
through Kraghammer without you knowing,

883
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:47,909
or is that all locked up?

884
00:32:47,909 --> 00:32:48,876
MATT: "Oh, I highly doubt that, not with

885
00:32:48,876 --> 00:32:49,876
"the way our carvers are trained."

886
00:32:49,876 --> 00:32:51,313
LIAM: Understood, understood.

887
00:32:51,313 --> 00:32:52,423
LAURA: They are quite--

888
00:32:52,423 --> 00:32:54,121
MATT: "That's what I'm talking about.

889
00:32:54,121 --> 00:32:54,954
LAURA: Yeah.

890
00:32:54,954 --> 00:32:56,704
MATT: "Fine dwarven study."

891
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:58,804
TRAVIS: Before we go--

892
00:32:58,804 --> 00:32:59,904
LAURA: Strong ale.

893
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,895
MATT: "Finest of military classes, aye.

894
00:33:01,895 --> 00:33:02,818
"Proud of 'em."

895
00:33:02,818 --> 00:33:03,911
TRAVIS: What do you use for the--

896
00:33:03,911 --> 00:33:05,612
MATT: "I had a cousin who was once a carver.

897
00:33:05,612 --> 00:33:06,445
"Raised him there.

898
00:33:06,445 --> 00:33:08,295
"His whole family brought
him up on that side.

900

"Couldn't come out and
play with the rest of us.

901

"I felt bad for him.

902
00:33:13,092 --> 00:33:15,367
"But he grew up to be a
right nasty dwarf, aye."

903
00:33:15,367 --> 00:33:17,025
LIAM: You say had.

904
00:33:17,025 --> 00:33:18,494
LAURA: Where is he now?

905
00:33:18,494 --> 00:33:21,891
MATT: "Unfortunately, he was slain
in one of the incursions.

"That duergar I was telling you about.

907

"But, such is the nature
of the fighter, I suppose."

908
00:33:28,076 --> 00:33:29,542
LAURA: A damn shame.

909
00:33:29,542 --> 00:33:30,375
I'm so sorry.

910
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:31,683
MATT: "I appreciate that.

911
00:33:31,683 --> 00:33:34,079
"To be honest, he was kind
of a bastard, but um--

912
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:35,355
"don't miss him too much.

913

SAM: We won't avenge him then.

916

MATT: "I mean, still avenge him."

917
00:33:40,345 --> 00:33:41,485
LIAM: Literally or figuratively?

918
00:33:41,485 --> 00:33:42,306
MATT: "I'm not sure.

919

LAURA: Not to you, to the other guy, Matt.

926

MATT: Ah, yes.

927
00:33:52,193 --> 00:33:53,737
(group laughs)

928
00:33:53,737 --> 00:33:54,900
MATT: Yes, Laura?

929
00:33:55,545 --> 00:33:58,235
LAURA: When we take a rest, do
we get our spells back

930
00:33:58,235 --> 00:33:59,331
for the day?

931
00:33:59,331 --> 00:34:00,164
MATT: Not a short rest.

932
00:34:00,164 --> 00:34:01,105
It has to be a long rest.

933
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:02,208
LAURA: All right, cool.

934
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:04,449
TALIESIN: Which is why we're
gonna take a proper nap.

LAURA: We're gonna take a real nap?

936

TALIESIN: I think we should go buy
some potions and take a nap.

937

LIAM: I think so.

938
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:12,312
LAURA: All right, this could be really bad.

939
00:34:12,312 --> 00:34:14,256
I mean, we're about to put the dungeons

940
00:34:14,256 --> 00:34:15,739
in Dungeons and Dragons.

941
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:17,877
TRAVIS: Let's go get drunk and go to sleep then.

MATT: There you go.

944
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,324
TALIESIN: And stock up on some potions.

945

Hieris, you've been so helpful.

946

MATT: "Of course, I'm happy to."

947

"You're welcome to stay as long as you like.

950
00:34:29,848 --> 00:34:32,299
I don't get visitors to
often up here in my booth."

951
00:34:32,299 --> 00:34:34,885
MARISHA: You should come drink
with us at the tavern.

952
00:34:34,885 --> 00:34:36,622
MATT: "Oh well, I have to stay here.

953
00:34:36,622 --> 00:34:38,526
"Work, at least for the next six hours."

954
00:34:38,526 --> 00:34:40,210
LIAM: All night, do you get
off in six more hours?

955
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:41,043
MATT: "Aye.

956
00:34:41,043 --> 00:34:42,398
"But I have some dried fruits.

957
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:43,844
"I've got some meats inside.

958
00:34:43,844 --> 00:34:47,665
"I've got two chairs and
you could fit in my lap,"

959
00:34:47,665 --> 00:34:49,255
and he kind of pats you on the head.

960
00:34:49,255 --> 00:34:50,327
SAM: I've killed.

961
00:34:50,327 --> 00:34:52,469
(group laughs)

962
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:53,547
MATT: "Right."

963
00:34:53,547 --> 00:34:56,311
ORION: This one needs a whore, sorry.

964
00:34:56,311 --> 00:34:57,282
(Sam grunts)

965
00:34:57,282 --> 00:34:58,449
MATT: "Fair enough."

966
00:34:58,956 --> 00:35:00,919
Also, apparently my mic's a bit loud.

967
00:35:00,919 --> 00:35:03,127
If you can turn it down
a bit for you guys.

968
00:35:03,127 --> 00:35:04,731
LIAM: What's a mic?

969
00:35:04,731 --> 00:35:06,235
MATT: "Forget that, you heard nothing.

970
00:35:06,235 --> 00:35:09,331
"It's a strange echo in the
caverns of Kraghammer. Anyway--"

971
00:35:09,331 --> 00:35:11,460
TRAVIS: Look at the time.

972
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,677
LAURA: We have to go.

973
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:14,319
We'll come see you again, Hieris.

974
00:35:14,319 --> 00:35:15,534
MATT: "Of course, anytime.

975
00:35:15,534 --> 00:35:16,537
"When we're not busy.

976
00:35:16,537 --> 00:35:18,487
"But when I'm not busy,
you're welcome to come by."

977
00:35:18,487 --> 00:35:19,343
ORION: All right.

978
00:35:19,343 --> 00:35:20,366
MARISHA: Oh, that'd be nice.

979
00:35:20,366 --> 00:35:22,976
LIAM: Tell you what, when we drag
our asses out of that mine,

980
00:35:22,976 --> 00:35:24,719
we'll come straight to
you and buy you a drink.

981
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:26,415
LAURA: And we'll have some of that dried fruit.

982
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:27,574
TRAVIS: We're lying, right?

983
00:35:27,574 --> 00:35:29,896
MATT: "Oh, I'll save a batch for
you, you half-elf lass."

984
00:35:29,896 --> 00:35:30,729
LAURA: All right.

985
00:35:30,729 --> 00:35:32,057
LIAM: Do the wink thing you do.

986
00:35:32,057 --> 00:35:33,420
LAURA: I did, I already did.

987
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,963
LIAM: Oh, you did it already.

988
00:35:34,963 --> 00:35:35,996
She's good at winking.

989
00:35:35,996 --> 00:35:38,009
MATT: "I saw, it was a good wink.

990
00:35:38,009 --> 00:35:39,930
"Aye. Made me tingle in my shoulders."

991
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,406
GROG: Just your shoulders?

992
00:35:41,406 --> 00:35:43,948
MATT: "That might be the diabetes, but--"

993
00:35:43,948 --> 00:35:45,256
(group laughs)

994
00:35:45,256 --> 00:35:46,691
MATT: "But mostly the wink, I think."

995
00:35:46,691 --> 00:35:47,524
TRAVIS: Good.

996
00:35:47,524 --> 00:35:50,534
MARISHA: Oh, we should get him something
other than dried fruit.

997
00:35:50,534 --> 00:35:51,817
That's not good for diabetes.

998
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:53,091
TRAVIS: Back to the tavern.

999
00:35:53,091 --> 00:35:55,043
TALIESIN: At least it means he's regular.

1000
00:35:55,043 --> 00:35:56,675
TRAVIS: Or did you have something?

1001
00:35:56,675 --> 00:35:57,782
SAM: No, we're good.

1002
00:35:57,782 --> 00:35:58,875
Back to the tavern.

1003
00:35:58,875 --> 00:36:01,728
We go back to the Iron
Hearth Tavern, right?

1004
00:36:01,728 --> 00:36:03,237
Is that what it's called?

1005
00:36:03,237 --> 00:36:06,421
MATT: For those who are asking, that's
West Country, is the accent.

1006
00:36:06,421 --> 00:36:07,133
LAURA: Yes.

1007
00:36:07,133 --> 00:36:08,023
MATT: Cornwall.

1008
00:36:08,023 --> 00:36:09,753
LAURA: What time is it?

1009
00:36:09,753 --> 00:36:10,753
Should we buy potions now?

1010
00:36:10,753 --> 00:36:12,267
TRAVIS: If we're underground--

1011
00:36:12,267 --> 00:36:13,433
LAURA: Oh, is everything open?

1012
00:36:13,433 --> 00:36:15,565
MATT: As far as you guys know, it's somewhere

1013
00:36:15,565 --> 00:36:17,780
in the neighborhood of
sunsettish afternoon.

1014
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,283
LAURA: Are the stores still open?

1015
00:36:19,283 --> 00:36:21,053
TRAVIS: It's summer.

1016
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:22,715
MATT: You can certainly check.

1017
00:36:22,715 --> 00:36:24,841
SAM: It's like La Vegas, it's always twilight.

1018
00:36:24,841 --> 00:36:26,034
TRAVIS:: There you go.

1019
00:36:26,034 --> 00:36:30,026
ORION: If you all don't mind, I
suggest we item up a bit,

1020
00:36:30,026 --> 00:36:32,385
and before we get too late,

1021
00:36:32,385 --> 00:36:34,406
and we get too drunk, Grog,

1022
00:36:34,406 --> 00:36:37,213
go back to that lightning --
main-- manor-- lightning cage.

1023
00:36:37,373 --> 00:36:38,606
LAURA: Oh, that place.

1024
00:36:38,606 --> 00:36:40,029
MATT: House Thunderbrand?

1025
00:36:40,029 --> 00:36:41,307
ORION: House Thunderbrand.

1026
00:36:41,307 --> 00:36:42,226
(Matt laughs)

1027
00:36:42,226 --> 00:36:43,729
TRAVIS: Where do we item up?

1028
00:36:43,729 --> 00:36:45,496
Do we get potions and stuff somewhere?

1029
00:36:45,496 --> 00:36:47,015
LAURA: Yeah, that's what we're looking for.

1030
00:36:47,015 --> 00:36:49,688
LIAM: When you say too drunk, do
you mean "we" the adventurers

1031
00:36:49,688 --> 00:36:52,779
or the humans back in Los Angeles?

1032
00:36:52,779 --> 00:36:54,549
ORION: Both parties.

1033
00:36:54,549 --> 00:36:55,549
Cross-plane.

1034
00:36:56,954 --> 00:36:58,121
MARISHA: Cross-Realm.

1035
00:36:58,121 --> 00:37:01,326
ORION: And I tell them what happened, again.

1036
00:37:01,326 --> 00:37:02,753
SAM: What happened?

1037
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:04,894
ORION: Well, I went to this door because--

1038
00:37:04,894 --> 00:37:06,894
SAM: Oh yes, yes, yes, yes.

1039
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:12,180
MATT: You later rested, shot arcane magic

1040
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,210
at the home of arcane magic in Kraghammer.

1041
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:16,383
ORION: And if we are to go down into this cave,

1042
00:37:16,383 --> 00:37:18,632
perhaps they have some
insight into what's going on

1043
00:37:18,632 --> 00:37:19,557
there as well.

1044
00:37:19,557 --> 00:37:20,691
Especially at this point in.

1045
00:37:20,691 --> 00:37:22,821
LAURA: Let's hurry and try to get them
before they go to sleep.

1046
00:37:22,821 --> 00:37:24,682
MARISHA: Maybe they have magical items.

1047
00:37:24,682 --> 00:37:25,515
I want stuff.

1048
00:37:25,515 --> 00:37:27,910
ORION: And I priorly had luck with more than--

1049
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:30,125
TRAVIS: Like plant stuff or potion stuff?

1050
00:37:31,969 --> 00:37:32,966
MARISHA: All stuff.

1051
00:37:32,966 --> 00:37:35,532
LIAM: Have you had any luck
finding an arcane--

1052
00:37:35,532 --> 00:37:37,443
LAURA: That's what we're talking about.

1053
00:37:37,443 --> 00:37:38,781
LIAM: No, I know that.

1054
00:37:38,781 --> 00:37:41,011
Did you send any fireballs at doors again

1055
00:37:41,011 --> 00:37:42,700
like you've done in the past, or--?

1056
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:46,543
ORION: Yes, I knocked, as I do often do.

1057
00:37:46,543 --> 00:37:48,043
And nothing doing.

1058
00:37:48,413 --> 00:37:49,453
LAURA: All right.

1059
00:37:49,453 --> 00:37:50,286
LIAM: Got it.

1060
00:37:50,286 --> 00:37:51,649
TRAVIS: So, magic stuffs.

1061
00:37:51,649 --> 00:37:52,929
LAURA: Let's go find them.

1062
00:37:52,929 --> 00:37:54,022
TALIESIN: All right.

1063
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:56,331
MARISHA: So wait--
it seems like they really

1064
00:37:56,331 --> 00:37:58,209
don't want you in their door.

1065
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:00,031
It seems very heavily guarded.

1066
00:38:00,031 --> 00:38:02,353
So what's our plan, we
just going to try again?

1067
00:38:02,353 --> 00:38:04,286
LAURA: Well it was nighttime before.

1068
00:38:04,286 --> 00:38:05,559
Maybe they'll be more--

1069
00:38:05,561 --> 00:38:07,574
SAM: We're gonna do what we always do: wing it.

1070
00:38:07,574 --> 00:38:09,155
TALIESIN: We're gonna try it again,

1071
00:38:09,155 --> 00:38:10,776
except we're gonna watch this time.

1072
00:38:10,776 --> 00:38:11,609
It'll be fun.

1073
00:38:11,609 --> 00:38:12,442
MATT: There you go.

1074
00:38:12,442 --> 00:38:13,275
MARISHA: Let's do it.

1075
00:38:13,275 --> 00:38:14,768
LIAM: I walk back to the door, because we're all

1076
00:38:14,768 --> 00:38:16,216
just standing outside the door.

1077
00:38:16,216 --> 00:38:17,129
MATT: Correct.

1078
00:38:17,129 --> 00:38:19,133
LIAM: I walk back to Hieris's
door and knock on it

1079
00:38:19,133 --> 00:38:20,387
and poke my head in.

1080
00:38:20,387 --> 00:38:21,765
Hieris, I'm sorry.

1081
00:38:21,765 --> 00:38:23,484
MATT: You catch him with a
handful of dried fruit,

1082
00:38:23,484 --> 00:38:24,317
"Hmph!

1083
00:38:24,317 --> 00:38:25,150
"Hi!"

1084
00:38:26,483 --> 00:38:27,616
LIAM: Just a quick question.

1085
00:38:27,616 --> 00:38:30,405
We have no fucking idea what time it is.

1086
00:38:30,405 --> 00:38:32,004
Because we usually use the sun.

1087
00:38:32,004 --> 00:38:33,146
Do you know what hour it is?

1088
00:38:33,146 --> 00:38:34,815
Are businesses open at the moment?

1089
00:38:34,815 --> 00:38:36,415
MATT: He reaches over and grabs this

1090
00:38:36,415 --> 00:38:39,064
really awesomely intricate
piece of clockwork on his desk.

1091
00:38:39,064 --> 00:38:41,925
It's this brass, cylindrical
piece that as he pulls out

1092
00:38:41,925 --> 00:38:44,260
you hear this (tongue clicking), fring!

1093
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,342
And springs and things making
strange whirring sounds.

1094
00:38:46,342 --> 00:38:49,443
"Oh, I reckon it's about
two hours from sunset."

1095
00:38:49,443 --> 00:38:50,689
ORION: Oh, very good.

1096
00:38:50,689 --> 00:38:52,860
LIAM: Are the stores open at the moment?

1097
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,184
TRAVIS: Better question.

1098
00:38:54,184 --> 00:38:55,597
MATT: "As far as I know, aye.

1099
00:38:55,597 --> 00:38:56,983
"Depending on the store."

1100
00:38:56,983 --> 00:38:58,297
LIAM: How much time do we have left?

1101
00:38:58,297 --> 00:38:59,130
MATT: "Few hours."

1102
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:00,699
LIAM: Oh, thank you, sir.

1103
00:39:00,699 --> 00:39:02,215
MATT: "You sure you don't want to stay?"

1104
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:03,198
LIAM: Let's go shopping.

1105
00:39:03,198 --> 00:39:04,922
TRAVIS: Thank you, Hieris thank you.
Oh, gotta go, sorry.

1106
00:39:04,922 --> 00:39:05,755
MATT: "Goodbye."

1107
00:39:05,755 --> 00:39:06,726
MARISHA: It's the mine that never sleeps.

1108
00:39:06,726 --> 00:39:07,559
MATT: "Good luck."

1109
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:08,392
LIAM: Byeee!

1110
00:39:08,392 --> 00:39:11,596
MATT: You hear the door open behind
you, and he starts waving

1111
00:39:11,596 --> 00:39:12,527
at you guys.

1112
00:39:12,527 --> 00:39:13,350
"Stay safe!"

1113
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,613
TALIESIN: Stay regular.

1114
00:39:14,613 --> 00:39:16,196
MARISHA: Eat some veggies!

1115
00:39:16,196 --> 00:39:17,946
Fruit's bad for the diabetes!

1116
00:39:17,946 --> 00:39:20,160
TRAVIS: Oh, I put my head back
in the door,

1117
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,749
and I throw him a turkey leg
and a beef jerky stick.

1118
00:39:24,053 --> 00:39:25,604
I gotta get rid of this stuff.

1119
00:39:25,604 --> 00:39:27,047
It's been in here for years.

1120
00:39:27,047 --> 00:39:29,732
TALIESIN: The fact that you just
checked your inventory

1121
00:39:29,732 --> 00:39:31,187
for that worries me.

1122
00:39:31,187 --> 00:39:33,529
TRAVIS: We gotta lotta shit in this bag.

1123
00:39:33,529 --> 00:39:36,814
MATT: The bag of holding, not so much a freezer.

1124
00:39:36,814 --> 00:39:38,947
TRAVIS: I didn't say it was good.

1125
00:39:38,947 --> 00:39:40,344
I just want it out.

1126
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:41,747
MARISHA: And then you just throw it at him?

1127
00:39:41,747 --> 00:39:44,172
MATT: The mildly rotted turkey
leg (imitates moist impact)

1128
00:39:44,172 --> 00:39:45,066
across the floor.

1129
00:39:45,066 --> 00:39:47,465
The remainder of what was
once meat, now a slush

1130
00:39:47,465 --> 00:39:50,047
sloughing off the bone as it
slams across the stone floor.

1131
00:39:50,047 --> 00:39:51,382
TRAVIS: It's really tender.

1132
00:39:51,382 --> 00:39:53,134
LIAM: You're a goliath, you'll eat anything.

1133
00:39:53,134 --> 00:39:54,712
TRAVIS: Yeah, those are the best parts.

1134
00:39:54,715 --> 00:39:56,188
MATT: You see he immediately steps back

1135
00:39:56,188 --> 00:39:57,261
and his face squints back.

1136
00:39:57,261 --> 00:39:59,003
MARISHA: That's not polite, Grog.

1137
00:39:59,003 --> 00:40:00,348
TRAVIS: I gave him a turkey leg.

1138
00:40:00,348 --> 00:40:01,788
MATT: "It's the thought that counts."

1139
00:40:01,788 --> 00:40:03,065
As he closes his door.

1140
00:40:03,065 --> 00:40:04,171
ORION: Hold, hold on.

1141
00:40:04,171 --> 00:40:06,740
Before he does that, I
cast prestidigitation,

1142
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,277
and I clean it up real quick.

1143
00:40:08,277 --> 00:40:10,086
MATT: Okay, that's really kind of you.

1144
00:40:10,086 --> 00:40:12,147
ORION: And I hand him a parchment and go,

1145
00:40:12,147 --> 00:40:14,697
if there's anything wrong,
just write the message on this,

1146
00:40:14,697 --> 00:40:16,164
and we'll come help.

1147
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:17,237
If there's any emergency.

1148
00:40:17,237 --> 00:40:19,362
And I hand him a parchment from
the Scroll of Telescription

1149
00:40:19,362 --> 00:40:21,097
that I made.

1150
00:40:21,097 --> 00:40:22,789
MATT: "All right. Thank you kindly."

1151
00:40:22,822 --> 00:40:24,703
LAURA: How many pages is that scroll?

1152
00:40:24,703 --> 00:40:25,918
Is it endless?

1153
00:40:25,918 --> 00:40:27,956
ORION: I made like
15 tickets right now.

1154
00:40:27,956 --> 00:40:29,652
And it takes me an hour to craft.

1155
00:40:29,652 --> 00:40:32,032
MATT: He takes it from you with trepidation.

1156
00:40:32,032 --> 00:40:34,842
You can see he probably hasn't
encountered dragonborn often,

1157
00:40:34,842 --> 00:40:36,675
and he's like, "Thanks."

1158
00:40:36,675 --> 00:40:38,646
ORION: Remember, dragonborn, we're good.

1159
00:40:38,646 --> 00:40:39,958
MATT: "Right."

1160
00:40:39,958 --> 00:40:40,845
ORION: So long.

1161
00:40:40,845 --> 00:40:41,678
And I leave.

1162
00:40:41,678 --> 00:40:42,511
MATT: "Thank ye."

1163
00:40:42,511 --> 00:40:43,288
Closes the door.

1164
00:40:43,288 --> 00:40:45,399
LAURA: Do you want to go with him
to the enchanting place

1165
00:40:45,399 --> 00:40:47,138
or do you wanna go somewhere else?

1166
00:40:47,138 --> 00:40:48,929
LIAM: I think I will go with
him just to keep him

1167
00:40:48,929 --> 00:40:50,795
from setting fire to the entire city.

1168
00:40:50,795 --> 00:40:52,871
LAURA: All right, shall we all go to the manor?

1169
00:40:52,871 --> 00:40:54,891
TALIESIN: We have time, we might as well.

1170
00:40:54,891 --> 00:40:56,337
ORION: Are we iteming up first?

1171
00:40:56,337 --> 00:40:57,645
TALIESIN: I figure we do that after.

1172
00:40:57,645 --> 00:40:59,038
LAURA: I think we'll do that.

1173
00:40:59,038 --> 00:41:02,151
MARISHA: I'm gonna go ahead and
turn into a squirrel

1174
00:41:02,151 --> 00:41:03,880
and hide in your pocket.

1175
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,713
LAURA: I like it.

1176
00:41:04,713 --> 00:41:05,546
MARISHA: Okay.

1177
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:06,665
LAURA: Ugh, Grog.

1178
00:41:06,665 --> 00:41:08,598
TRAVIS: What, it was a burp!

1179
00:41:08,598 --> 00:41:10,960
(group laughs)

1180
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,593
MATT: Technically in character.

1181
00:41:12,593 --> 00:41:15,378
TRAVIS: Much worse from the
other end, I guarantee.

1182
00:41:15,738 --> 00:41:19,119
SAM: Okay, so we're going
to House Thunderbeards?

1183
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:20,468
Thunderbirds?

1184
00:41:20,468 --> 00:41:22,592
MATT: You guys head to the House Thunderbrand.

1185
00:41:22,592 --> 00:41:23,745
SAM: Brand.

1186
00:41:23,745 --> 00:41:24,578
MATT: All right.

1187
00:41:24,578 --> 00:41:26,949
So, Tiberius leads you
to where it's residing.

1188
00:41:26,949 --> 00:41:28,443
Once again you come upon

1189
00:41:28,443 --> 00:41:30,164
what looks like a very out of place,

1190
00:41:30,164 --> 00:41:33,924
very well-kept green lawn that
stretches for a good 60 feet

1191
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:37,168
before you see this
really beautiful-looking

1192
00:41:37,168 --> 00:41:39,327
alabaster and gold building,

1193
00:41:39,327 --> 00:41:41,958
slightly domed with these
four towers to each corner,

1194
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:44,016
with these blue
pointed crystals on top

1195
00:41:44,016 --> 00:41:44,952
of each tower.

1196
00:41:44,952 --> 00:41:46,468
LIAM: How does the grass grow down here?

1197
00:41:46,468 --> 00:41:49,585
LAURA: Can we see any traps or
glyphs that are active?

1198
00:41:49,585 --> 00:41:51,856
MATT: He points out
to you as you approach,

1199
00:41:51,856 --> 00:41:55,086
there are a series of stone
sigils carved into the stonework

1200
00:41:55,086 --> 00:41:57,101
that surrounds the exterior of the lawn.

1201
00:41:57,101 --> 00:41:58,064
ORION: Those things!

1202
00:41:58,064 --> 00:42:00,682
LAURA: Can we look around and
see if there's any way to,

1203
00:42:00,682 --> 00:42:03,252
a bell to ring that's
outside of that area.

1204
00:42:03,252 --> 00:42:04,685
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.

1205
00:42:06,631 --> 00:42:08,548
TALIESIN: Can I assist on that?

1206
00:42:10,229 --> 00:42:13,241
LAURA: Yeah, please do, 'cause I rolled a one.

1207
00:42:13,241 --> 00:42:14,074
One, baby.

1208
00:42:14,074 --> 00:42:15,408
TALIESIN: It's a 10.

1209
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:17,602
LAURA: I failed it hard, I failed it.

1210
00:42:17,602 --> 00:42:19,885
TALIESIN: If you rolled a one, there's
nothing I can do anyway.

1211
00:42:19,885 --> 00:42:20,946
MATT: What'd you roll?

1212
00:42:20,946 --> 00:42:22,219
LIAM: We ain't found shit.

1213
00:42:22,219 --> 00:42:23,445
TRAVIS: She rolled a one.

1214
00:42:23,445 --> 00:42:24,775
MATT: Rolled a one naturally?

1215
00:42:24,775 --> 00:42:25,608
LAURA: I did.

1216
00:42:25,608 --> 00:42:28,724
MATT: Best you can tell,
stonework's pretty solid.

1217
00:42:28,724 --> 00:42:29,557
LAURA: Cool!

1218
00:42:29,557 --> 00:42:30,390
Hey, it's a house.

1219
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:31,920
MATT: Yeah.

1220
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,807
MATT: There are dwarves around. No.

1221
00:42:33,807 --> 00:42:34,742
TRAVIS: Good.

1222
00:42:34,742 --> 00:42:36,737
MATT: As you look about, it's
hard to tell the nature.

1223
00:42:36,737 --> 00:42:37,704
This looks just like a lawn

1224
00:42:37,704 --> 00:42:40,740
with a well-framed stone exterior.

1225
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:41,573
LAURA: Cool.

1226
00:42:41,573 --> 00:42:42,996
MATT: But there's no fence.

1227
00:42:42,996 --> 00:42:44,869
There's nothing keeping you from walking

1228
00:42:44,869 --> 00:42:46,458
into the lawn and towards the building.

1229
00:42:46,458 --> 00:42:49,397
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check
to see what light source

1230
00:42:49,397 --> 00:42:51,396
is making all this grass grow,

1231
00:42:51,396 --> 00:42:53,062
or if it's like magical growing?

1232
00:42:53,062 --> 00:42:54,555
MATT: No nature check required.

1233
00:42:54,555 --> 00:42:57,052
There is no light source,
other than the green rocks

1234
00:42:57,052 --> 00:42:59,660
that generally permeate
the interior of Kraghammer

1235
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,630
to give its kind of strange
luminescent atmosphere.

1236
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:05,000
This kind of dull red glow
that's around the entire city.

1237
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,865
Other than a couple of
sparks of lantern light.

1238
00:43:06,865 --> 00:43:08,295
There's no light source.

1239
00:43:08,295 --> 00:43:09,588
SAM: I wonder what Keyleth is doing.

1240
00:43:09,588 --> 00:43:10,760
She's squeaking an awful lot.

1241
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,293
(Marisha imitates squirrel)

1242
00:43:12,293 --> 00:43:14,479
LAURA: Oh that's right, she's in my pocket.

1243
00:43:14,479 --> 00:43:15,312
Hi!

1244
00:43:15,312 --> 00:43:16,585
TRAVIS: So we just walk up and--

1245
00:43:16,585 --> 00:43:18,223
LAURA: Can I pet her little head.

1246
00:43:18,223 --> 00:43:20,445
ORION: No, I don't suggest that, Grog.

1247
00:43:20,445 --> 00:43:22,006
I shoot firebolt.

1248
00:43:22,006 --> 00:43:23,579
MATT: I forgot that wasn't water. (coughs)

1249
00:43:23,585 --> 00:43:25,216
TALIESIN: Did you actually try to walk up?

1250
00:43:25,216 --> 00:43:26,120
LIAM: Is there a front door?

1251
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:28,979
TALIESIN: Perhaps you should,
before you do anything. Just try and walk up.

1252
00:43:28,979 --> 00:43:30,432
MATT: From what you can see,

1253
00:43:30,432 --> 00:43:33,161
There appears to be a large,
almost like beachwood,

1254
00:43:33,161 --> 00:43:35,777
Light wood double door in
the front of the compound.

1255
00:43:35,777 --> 00:43:36,610
LAURA: Grog's gonna go.

1256
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:38,967
LIAM: I'm gonna use my rogue
abilities to walk up

1257
00:43:38,967 --> 00:43:40,803
to the front door, and knock on it.

1258
00:43:40,803 --> 00:43:41,636
ORION: Great.

1259
00:43:41,636 --> 00:43:42,711
LAURA: Sorry Grog.

1260
00:43:42,711 --> 00:43:44,619
TRAVIS: I have one job.
To take damage.

1261
00:43:44,619 --> 00:43:46,385
LIAM: Can I see if I detect a bell?

1262
00:43:46,385 --> 00:43:48,890
MARISHA: Is that a talent you
picked, is that a feat?

1263
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:50,935
MATT: So, you walk towards the grass.

1264
00:43:50,935 --> 00:43:52,882
You step onto the walkway that leads

1265
00:43:52,882 --> 00:43:54,143
towards the front of the building.

1266
00:43:54,143 --> 00:43:55,879
As soon as you cross into the threshold

1267
00:43:55,879 --> 00:43:57,197
where those stone sigils are,

1268
00:43:57,197 --> 00:43:58,658
you make a dexterity saving throw.

1269
00:43:58,658 --> 00:43:59,491
(Travis laughs)

1270
00:43:59,491 --> 00:44:01,056
LAURA: Oh no.

1271
00:44:01,056 --> 00:44:02,415
Roll well, my brother.

1272
00:44:02,415 --> 00:44:04,751
LIAM: This is really not good
for their business.

1273
00:44:04,751 --> 00:44:07,044
[LIAM and LAURA groan]

1274
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:08,017
(group laughs)

1275
00:44:09,171 --> 00:44:10,004
LIAM: 12.

1276
00:44:10,004 --> 00:44:10,933
MATT: 12.

1277
00:44:10,933 --> 00:44:11,766
LAURA: Oh no.

1278
00:44:11,766 --> 00:44:14,648
MATT: So, as you pull your cloak
around you and take a few steps

1279
00:44:14,648 --> 00:44:17,519
to jaunt upwards, suddenly
there's, you guys hear it.

1280
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:20,729
The strange (tongue clicking) sound,

1281
00:44:20,729 --> 00:44:23,979
and a poof, poof of arcane
blue energy kind of,

1282
00:44:23,979 --> 00:44:25,753
just pulses around his feet.

1283
00:44:25,753 --> 00:44:27,576
You instinctively begin to
pull back, but as you do,

1284
00:44:27,576 --> 00:44:29,390
there's a blast of blue electric energy

1285
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:30,607
that (imitates explosion),

1286
00:44:30,607 --> 00:44:32,813
streaks out from all around
you, shocking your body

1287
00:44:32,813 --> 00:44:34,738
and throwing you about 15 feet back,

1288
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:36,557
straight onto your shoulders.

1289
00:44:36,557 --> 00:44:38,900
You (imitates grinding) skid
to a halt (imitates thud).

1290
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:40,609
LIAM: Which one of these do I roll for damage?

1291
00:44:40,609 --> 00:44:42,351
TRAVIS: Electrified sound effect.

1292
00:44:42,351 --> 00:44:43,184
MATT: You take...

1293
00:44:43,184 --> 00:44:44,999
LIAM: Higigigigi!

1294
00:44:44,999 --> 00:44:46,993
MATT: 14 points of lightning damage.

1295
00:44:46,993 --> 00:44:47,826
LIAM: All right.

1296
00:44:47,826 --> 00:44:50,503
ORION: This is as I'm paused
telling him not to do that.

1297
00:44:50,503 --> 00:44:51,336
MATT: Yes.

1298
00:44:51,336 --> 00:44:52,329
ORION: Don't!

1299
00:44:52,329 --> 00:44:53,781
TRAVIS: Should've let me go.

1300
00:44:53,781 --> 00:44:55,650
MATT: Your muscles eventually relax.

1301
00:44:56,679 --> 00:44:59,458
ORION: As I was about to say,
that was going to happen.

1302
00:44:59,458 --> 00:45:01,052
TRAVIS: We have a flying carpet.

1303
00:45:01,052 --> 00:45:02,827
LAURA: Hey, we have a flying carpet!

1304
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,193
We have a flying carpet.

1305
00:45:05,193 --> 00:45:07,846
ORION: Let me try one thing
that I didn't think to do last time.

1306
00:45:07,846 --> 00:45:10,686
I'm gonna cast Dispel
Magic on the runestone.

1307
00:45:10,686 --> 00:45:11,519
LIAM: Don't tase me, bro.

1308
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:12,352
MATT: Okay.

1309
00:45:12,352 --> 00:45:13,185
Go ahead and--

1310
00:45:13,185 --> 00:45:15,124
TRAVIS: It's really not that bad.

1311
00:45:15,124 --> 00:45:16,170
MATT: Let's see.

1312
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:17,514
LAURA: Pull it out.

1313
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:18,347
TRAVIS: What?

1314
00:45:18,347 --> 00:45:19,762
LAURA: Pull out the flying--

1315
00:45:19,762 --> 00:45:20,865
MARISHA: Phrasing.

1316
00:45:20,865 --> 00:45:23,031
SAM: Going for the handbook.

1317
00:45:23,031 --> 00:45:25,309
MATT: Yeah, so we know what's going on.

1318
00:45:25,309 --> 00:45:27,375
TRAVIS: Oh, the magic carpet, hold on.

1319
00:45:29,084 --> 00:45:31,758
SAM: Guys, don't forget to
subscribe to Geek and Sundry.

1320
00:45:31,758 --> 00:45:33,084
LAURA: Oh yeah!

1321
00:45:33,084 --> 00:45:35,819
ORION: Oh, and I cast it at my fourth level slot.

1322
00:45:35,822 --> 00:45:37,775
TRAVIS: You wanna fly it up to the door?

1323
00:45:37,775 --> 00:45:39,338
MARISHA: What are you casting?

1324
00:45:39,338 --> 00:45:40,501
ORION: Dispel magic.

1325
00:45:40,501 --> 00:45:43,354
MATT: All right, make an arcana check.

1326
00:45:43,354 --> 00:45:46,169
LAURA: It can't carry you, you're too heavy.

1327
00:45:46,169 --> 00:45:47,822
TRAVIS: I said you, not me.

1328
00:45:47,822 --> 00:45:49,866
LAURA: Oh, gimme that flying carpet.

1329
00:45:49,866 --> 00:45:51,465
TRAVIS: That's what I said.

1330
00:45:51,465 --> 00:45:52,298
ORION: 13.

1331
00:45:52,298 --> 00:45:53,557
MATT: 13?

1332
00:45:53,557 --> 00:45:54,390
ORION: Yeah.

1333
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:55,223
MATT: Okay.

1334
00:45:56,179 --> 00:46:00,417
As you concentrate and these
kind of shimmering bands

1335
00:46:00,417 --> 00:46:03,457
of arcane energy wave off your
hands toward the enchantment,

1336
00:46:03,457 --> 00:46:06,874
they impact and dissipate without effect.

1337
00:46:06,874 --> 00:46:09,025
ORION: Are they fourth level or higher?

1338
00:46:09,025 --> 00:46:10,193
MATT: They seem to be.

1339
00:46:10,193 --> 00:46:11,026
ORION: Fuck.

1340
00:46:11,026 --> 00:46:13,779
LAURA: I hop on the flying carpet.

1341
00:46:13,779 --> 00:46:17,008
MATT: Okay, so you pull the flying
carpet, Mary Poppins-style,

1342
00:46:17,008 --> 00:46:19,541
out of the bag of holding.
(imitates soft thud)

1343
00:46:19,541 --> 00:46:22,239
LAURA: Yes. And see if I can fly up
and over to the door.

1344
00:46:22,239 --> 00:46:24,653
TRAVIS: Do you wanna tie a rope
around your waist

1345
00:46:24,653 --> 00:46:25,622
in case it goes bad?

1346
00:46:25,622 --> 00:46:27,606
ORION: It's a flying magical carpet.

1347
00:46:27,606 --> 00:46:29,076
LAURA: Somebody.

1348
00:46:29,076 --> 00:46:29,908
Oh.

1349
00:46:29,908 --> 00:46:30,741
Is that bad?

1350
00:46:30,741 --> 00:46:31,754
Is that a bad idea?

1351
00:46:31,754 --> 00:46:32,867
TRAVIS: No, do it.

1352
00:46:32,867 --> 00:46:34,720
ORION: It's a flying magical carpet.

1353
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,023
SAM: What could go wrong?

1354
00:46:36,023 --> 00:46:38,150
MARISHA: I think you'll just, like, hit a wall.

1355
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:40,162
LAURA: What if the flying carpet gets ruined?

1356
00:46:40,162 --> 00:46:41,425
SAM: Let's not do that then.

1357
00:46:41,425 --> 00:46:42,695
TRAVIS: Oh my God, really?

1358
00:46:42,695 --> 00:46:43,981
LIAM: It's not gonna be ruined.

1359
00:46:43,981 --> 00:46:47,373
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait, I'm in squirrel form.

1360
00:46:47,373 --> 00:46:48,235
So I go out.

1361
00:46:48,235 --> 00:46:49,728
LAURA: Oh, and you're with me.

1362
00:46:49,728 --> 00:46:50,561
Let's both fly to the door.

1363
00:46:50,561 --> 00:46:52,766
LIAM: I have nine healing potions--

1364
00:46:52,766 --> 00:46:54,149
SAM: Hey, hold on, hold on.

1365
00:46:54,149 --> 00:46:55,542
TRAVIS: What what, you turned invisible

1366
00:46:55,542 --> 00:46:56,791
and walked inside a house last time.

1367
00:46:56,791 --> 00:46:58,757
SAM: Yeah, I can do whatever we want.

1368
00:46:58,757 --> 00:47:00,615
Do you want me to knock on the door,

1369
00:47:00,615 --> 00:47:02,193
is that what we're trying to do?

1370
00:47:02,193 --> 00:47:03,461
LAURA: Oh yeah, use your--

1371
00:47:03,461 --> 00:47:04,604
SAM: Okay, so yes.

1372
00:47:04,604 --> 00:47:07,345
I send an unseen servant
to knock on the door.

1373
00:47:07,345 --> 00:47:09,445
TRAVIS: What kind, like a buddy?

1374
00:47:09,445 --> 00:47:11,551
LAURA: Oh, he tried it before.

1375
00:47:11,551 --> 00:47:14,008
MATT: Where do you create
the unseen servant?

1376
00:47:14,008 --> 00:47:15,461
SAM: Where do I create it?

1377
00:47:15,461 --> 00:47:16,284
MATT: Yeah.

1378
00:47:16,284 --> 00:47:18,062
SAM: Right on the doorknocker.

1379
00:47:18,062 --> 00:47:19,836
Like, hanging on the doorknocker.

1380
00:47:19,836 --> 00:47:21,416
TRAVIS: Feet touching the ground?

1381
00:47:21,416 --> 00:47:24,577
MATT: All right. So the distance unseen
servant can be summoned--

1382
00:47:24,577 --> 00:47:25,484
LAURA: Oh no.

1383
00:47:25,484 --> 00:47:28,847
MATT: I believe you may be able
to actually summon it

1384
00:47:28,847 --> 00:47:31,265
within the boundary of
those arcane sigils.

1385
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:33,847
TRAVIS: I'm just sitting back
here holding the carpet.

1386
00:47:33,847 --> 00:47:36,240
♫ I can show you the world ♫

1387
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,175
(group laughs)

1388
00:47:38,175 --> 00:47:39,578
MATT: 60 feet, so yeah.

1389
00:47:39,578 --> 00:47:41,238
You go ahead and you walk
up to where that sigil is,

1390
00:47:41,238 --> 00:47:43,618
you finish your spell,
you cast unseen servant.

1391
00:47:43,618 --> 00:47:45,997
SAM: ♫ Unseen servant, ho ♫

1392
00:47:45,997 --> 00:47:47,530
(group laughs)

1393
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:48,575
MATT: Which he says every time.

1394
00:47:48,575 --> 00:47:49,408
SAM: Yes.

1395
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:51,287
MATT: Every single time.

1396
00:47:51,287 --> 00:47:52,991
You see this strange shift of air

1397
00:47:52,991 --> 00:47:55,354
as some sort of humanoid
form then materializes

1398
00:47:55,354 --> 00:47:57,201
in the opposite side of this boundary

1399
00:47:57,201 --> 00:48:00,050
and stands at your ready and command.

1400
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:01,861
SAM: We still haven't knocked
on the door, correct?

1401
00:48:01,861 --> 00:48:02,694
GROUP: No.

1402
00:48:02,694 --> 00:48:04,422
MATT: It's about a 60 foot walk.

1403
00:48:04,422 --> 00:48:07,384
SAM: I command the unseen servant
to (imitates knocking)

1404
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:09,327
MATT: It kind of saunters over.

1405
00:48:09,327 --> 00:48:11,747
You guys see this kind of shifting,

1406
00:48:11,747 --> 00:48:14,184
barely, barely visible form make its way

1407
00:48:14,184 --> 00:48:15,912
up to the front door.

1408
00:48:15,912 --> 00:48:17,999
In the distance, you
hear a dull (knocking).

1409
00:48:20,829 --> 00:48:23,688
Eventually, the door slightly opens.

1410
00:48:23,688 --> 00:48:25,680
And you see a hunched figure

1411
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,288
with bright white, chalk-white hair,

1412
00:48:28,288 --> 00:48:30,592
kind of look out the doorway,

1413
00:48:30,592 --> 00:48:33,143
"Oh, where's he come from?"

1414
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:34,881
Looking at the form in front of him.

1415
00:48:34,881 --> 00:48:35,714
SAM: Oh, the ghost.

1416
00:48:35,714 --> 00:48:36,547
MATT: Yeah.

1417
00:48:38,068 --> 00:48:40,128
"That's where you come from.

1418
00:48:40,128 --> 00:48:41,527
All right."

1419
00:48:41,527 --> 00:48:42,360
SAM: Hello!

1420
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,341
ORION: I'm waving.

1421
00:48:43,341 --> 00:48:44,908
Hello.

1422
00:48:44,908 --> 00:48:46,529
MATT: Opens the door, comes out.

1423
00:48:46,529 --> 00:48:49,869
You now see this dwarven
figure hunched, very, very old,

1424
00:48:49,869 --> 00:48:53,522
with a long, very, very
well-crafted brass staff,

1425
00:48:53,522 --> 00:48:56,653
looks like a black or
purple gem at the top.

1426
00:48:56,653 --> 00:48:58,392
Spectacles at the tip of its nose.

1427
00:48:58,392 --> 00:49:01,347
And it begins to kind of shift
its way over towards you.

1428
00:49:01,347 --> 00:49:03,388
(breathes heavily)

1429
00:49:03,388 --> 00:49:05,076
ORION: Watch out for that rune.

1430
00:49:05,076 --> 00:49:06,347
It's still on.

1431
00:49:06,347 --> 00:49:07,633
SAM: I think he knows that.

1432
00:49:07,633 --> 00:49:09,876
(laughing)

1433
00:49:10,709 --> 00:49:13,042
MATT: Eventually making its way.

1434
00:49:15,165 --> 00:49:17,039
TRAVIS: He's coming towards us?

1435
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:20,319
MATT: Yes. Walks right to the edge of the sigil.

1436
00:49:20,992 --> 00:49:23,518
Puts his hand up, and the
unseen servant vanishes.

1437
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:30,064
He goes, "So, you have my attention."

1438
00:49:30,594 --> 00:49:32,632
ORION: Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.

1439
00:49:32,632 --> 00:49:34,911
My name's Tiberius Stormwind,
and these are my friends.

1440
00:49:34,911 --> 00:49:37,710
MATT: He puts his hand up and there's no sound

1441
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:39,607
coming out of your mouth.

1442
00:49:40,817 --> 00:49:41,797
(Travis laughs)

1443
00:49:41,797 --> 00:49:43,334
SAM: Maybe we should listen.

1444
00:49:43,334 --> 00:49:46,206
MATT: "This is the one who would-be
attacked our home abode

1445
00:49:46,206 --> 00:49:48,706
not more than a few hours ago."

1446
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:51,397
SAM: He has emotional problems.

1447
00:49:51,397 --> 00:49:52,831
MATT: "Apparently.

1448
00:49:52,831 --> 00:49:55,726
He needs to learn respect
for other people's property."

1449
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:56,879
LAURA: Yes, he does.

1450
00:49:56,879 --> 00:49:58,473
LIAM: We agree wholeheartedly.

1451
00:49:58,473 --> 00:50:00,039
He's dragonborn, he's weird.

1452
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:01,603
He's a little weird.

1453
00:50:02,766 --> 00:50:04,619
We're sorry to interrupt.

1454
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:07,726
I don't know, it's dinnertime, I think.

1455
00:50:07,726 --> 00:50:09,927
I don't know if you've
heard yet, it just happened.

1456
00:50:09,927 --> 00:50:12,053
We just fought some sort
of many-headed beast

1457
00:50:12,053 --> 00:50:14,592
down at the mines, and Lord Greyspine

1458
00:50:14,592 --> 00:50:16,752
is sending us in.

1459
00:50:16,752 --> 00:50:19,403
So before we go, we were sent here.

1460
00:50:19,403 --> 00:50:21,768
We were told you were
the dwarf to speak to

1461
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:22,851
if we needed--

1462
00:50:23,708 --> 00:50:26,791
LAURA: To know about the magical entities.

1463
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:29,761
LIAM: I think it was just to get shit.

1464
00:50:29,761 --> 00:50:30,924
(Travis and Sam laugh)

1465
00:50:30,924 --> 00:50:32,273
LIAM: To get ready for those entities.

1466
00:50:32,646 --> 00:50:35,470
MATT: "If you're looking to but
trinkets and magical oddities--

1467
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:36,387
LAURA: Trinkets!

1468
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:39,339
MATT: "You've come to the wrong place.

1469
00:50:39,339 --> 00:50:41,047
"This is a house of study.

1470
00:50:41,047 --> 00:50:44,178
"This is where hardworking
dwarves of arcane persuasion

1471
00:50:44,178 --> 00:50:46,123
"put their lives towards pursuing--

1472
00:50:46,123 --> 00:50:47,329
TRAVIS: Say something!

1473
00:50:47,329 --> 00:50:48,866
MATT: "--the magical forms and fields that--

1474
00:50:48,866 --> 00:50:50,498
SAM: And we have come to seek your knowledge.

1475
00:50:50,498 --> 00:50:51,331
MATT: "I'm sorry."

1476
00:50:51,331 --> 00:50:52,164
Your sound is back.

1477
00:50:52,164 --> 00:50:54,418
ORION: That's what I'm trying to
say is that I came here

1478
00:50:54,418 --> 00:50:57,057
looking to ask about the arcane studies.

1479
00:50:57,057 --> 00:50:58,607
I'm extremely interested in that.

1480
00:50:58,607 --> 00:51:00,214
When I heard that your house

1481
00:51:00,214 --> 00:51:02,229
Was the only one that was
in that particular study,

1482
00:51:02,229 --> 00:51:04,048
I was immensely intrigued.

1483
00:51:04,048 --> 00:51:06,628
I respect the arcane
arts so much that it's,

1484
00:51:06,628 --> 00:51:07,709
well, it's been my life.

1485
00:51:07,709 --> 00:51:10,928
And right now, we're in bit of a situation

1486
00:51:10,928 --> 00:51:12,874
where we have to go
slaughter a bunch of nasties

1487
00:51:12,874 --> 00:51:14,756
in apparently one of your mines.

1488
00:51:14,756 --> 00:51:17,012
And we don't know the source.

1489
00:51:17,012 --> 00:51:19,273
And it appears to be of
an extreme arcane nature

1490
00:51:19,273 --> 00:51:22,495
of the dark sense, and I
figured we could come to you

1491
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:25,075
for help and some kind of guidance.

1492
00:51:25,075 --> 00:51:27,211
And I will-- Scanlan, will you stop it!

1493
00:51:27,211 --> 00:51:31,738
And it appears that you
very well know something

1494
00:51:31,738 --> 00:51:35,808
that we could learn from, with
all due respect, of course.

1495
00:51:35,808 --> 00:51:37,551
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

1496
00:51:37,551 --> 00:51:39,004
MARISHA: Holy shit. What the fuck.

1497
00:51:41,373 --> 00:51:42,206
Breathe.

1498
00:51:45,247 --> 00:51:46,080
ORION: 11.

1499
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,871
TRAVIS: God, what is with these rolls?

1500
00:51:47,871 --> 00:51:49,463
TALIESIN: We've been middling.

1501
00:51:49,463 --> 00:51:50,766
LAURA: Terrible rolls today.

1502
00:51:50,766 --> 00:51:53,169
MATT: The dwarf gives you
a disapproving brow shift

1503
00:51:53,169 --> 00:51:57,312
and goes, "Look, I mean no disrespect.

1504
00:51:58,773 --> 00:52:02,466
"But understand, this is a dwarven house

1505
00:52:02,466 --> 00:52:05,137
"of arcane practitioning and study.

1506
00:52:05,137 --> 00:52:07,061
"Don't see any dwarves among ya.

1507
00:52:07,061 --> 00:52:09,214
"I think our business here is concluded."

1508
00:52:09,214 --> 00:52:12,202
"If you're looking to buy stuff, we produce

1509
00:52:12,202 --> 00:52:16,362
"and sell through the Value
of Valor house of sale."

1510
00:52:16,362 --> 00:52:18,907
TRAVIS: Oh Tiberius, can't you become a dwarf?

1511
00:52:18,907 --> 00:52:21,575
TALIESIN: Of course, sir, we completely understand

1512
00:52:21,575 --> 00:52:23,231
if you're not up to such a challenge.

1513
00:52:23,231 --> 00:52:25,359
It makes perfect sense, and
we'll be more than happy to go

1514
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:27,233
and buy some wares somewhere else

1515
00:52:27,233 --> 00:52:28,686
if this is too much for you.

1516
00:52:28,686 --> 00:52:30,238
MATT: "Bah! Challenge."

1517
00:52:30,238 --> 00:52:32,445
ORION: I will send you my associate.

1518
00:52:32,445 --> 00:52:34,745
The dwarf turns around
and begins walking away

1519
00:52:34,745 --> 00:52:35,629
with his staff.

1520
00:52:35,629 --> 00:52:37,518
LAURA: What a beautiful staff that is.

1521
00:52:37,518 --> 00:52:40,361
ORION: I'm gonna cast Alter Self
on myself to be a dwarf.

1522
00:52:40,361 --> 00:52:42,991
TRAVIS: And jump behind me,
and act like you just--

1523
00:52:42,991 --> 00:52:45,486
LAURA: Actually sir, we do have a dwarf with us.

1524
00:52:45,486 --> 00:52:47,611
MARISHA: No wait wait wait! Cast it on me!

1525
00:52:47,611 --> 00:52:48,838
I'm a squirrel in her pocket.

1526
00:52:48,838 --> 00:52:51,011
ORION: Oh shit, I cast it on her instead.

1527
00:52:51,011 --> 00:52:53,536
(loud thudding)

1528
00:52:53,536 --> 00:52:56,480
LAURA: We have a dwarf with us who wanted

1529
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,069
to actually say hello to--

1530
00:52:58,069 --> 00:52:59,776
TRAVIS: (whispering) What's your dwarf name?

1531
00:52:59,776 --> 00:53:01,439
MATT: Turns around. Saunters back.

1532
00:53:01,439 --> 00:53:02,905
ORION: Keyleth, where have you been?

1533
00:53:02,905 --> 00:53:04,454
MARISHA: I guess it's Keyleth.

1534
00:53:04,454 --> 00:53:05,847
MATT: Looks at you.

1535
00:53:05,847 --> 00:53:07,320
TRAVIS: Keyleth Kraghammer.

1536
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:10,320
SAM: You better fucking speak dwarvish.

1537
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,398
MATT: Smiles for a second as
he looks at you and goes,

1538
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:14,997
"Ah, how nice to meet you.

1539
00:53:14,997 --> 00:53:16,524
"Where are you from?"

1540
00:53:16,524 --> 00:53:18,135
MARISHA: (bad Scottish accent) Oh, hello.

1541
00:53:18,135 --> 00:53:20,579
(group laughs)

1542
00:53:20,579 --> 00:53:21,412
LAURA: Oh, shit.

1543
00:53:21,412 --> 00:53:23,890
(Liam speaks in
Swedish-accented gibberish)

1544
00:53:23,890 --> 00:53:25,095
SAM: Ya, from Sweden.

1545
00:53:25,095 --> 00:53:27,313
TRAVIS: I'm gonna choke on a chip. (coughs)

1546
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:31,211
MARISHA: Keyleth is not good at this.

1547
00:53:31,211 --> 00:53:33,235
LIAM: Roll with it player, roll with it.

1548
00:53:33,235 --> 00:53:36,318
MARISHA: I hail from the mountains up north.

1549
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:42,093
ORION: She had an accident on the way over here.

1550
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:43,376
We were hoping maybe--

1551
00:53:43,376 --> 00:53:46,185
MATT: Roll a persuasion roll with disadvantage.

1552
00:53:46,185 --> 00:53:47,725
(all talking and laughing)

1553
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:50,134
MATT: You. Roll with disadvantage.

1554
00:53:52,022 --> 00:53:54,932
LIAM: Let the dice act better
than us tonight, please.

1555
00:53:54,932 --> 00:53:56,390
(group laughs)

1556
00:53:56,390 --> 00:53:58,590
TRAVIS: (high-pitched voice) Oh, hello!

1557
00:53:58,590 --> 00:54:01,480
MARISHA: Wait, persuasion--I don't have--oh, wait.

1558
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:02,698
I have a zero.

1559
00:54:02,698 --> 00:54:03,538
Eight.

1560
00:54:03,538 --> 00:54:04,739
MATT: That's your first roll.

1561
00:54:04,739 --> 00:54:05,945
Now roll again.

1562
00:54:05,945 --> 00:54:07,038
MARISHA: Oh, I have advantage.

1563
00:54:07,038 --> 00:54:08,301
MATT: No, you have disadvantage.

1564
00:54:08,301 --> 00:54:09,537
MARISHA: Oh, disadvantage.

1565
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:10,370
So eight.

1566
00:54:10,370 --> 00:54:11,203
MATT: Eight.

1567
00:54:11,203 --> 00:54:14,953
He goes, "I've been
practicing the arcane arts

1568
00:54:14,953 --> 00:54:17,996
"for over 250 years.

1569
00:54:19,541 --> 00:54:22,609
MARISHA: And I've been practicing
my Cornwall accent

1570
00:54:22,609 --> 00:54:24,026
for five minutes.

1571
00:54:25,608 --> 00:54:27,172
Shit.

1572
00:54:27,172 --> 00:54:28,861
MATT: He raises his hand,

1573
00:54:28,861 --> 00:54:31,436
and the Alter Self spell dissipates.

1574
00:54:31,436 --> 00:54:34,015
Where stands Keyleth.

1575
00:54:34,015 --> 00:54:36,871
SAM: Oh Keyleth, you've been
lying to us this whole time?

1576
00:54:36,871 --> 00:54:38,030
(Travis laughs)

1577
00:54:38,030 --> 00:54:39,040
ORION: Who are you?

1578
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,632
SAM: We thought you were a dwarf.

1579
00:54:40,632 --> 00:54:43,064
LIAM: Vax steps forward, steps in
front of Keyleth and says,

1580
00:54:43,064 --> 00:54:44,371
Good sir dwarf.

1581
00:54:44,371 --> 00:54:46,295
Clearly we are idiots.

1582
00:54:46,295 --> 00:54:47,194
We are--

1583
00:54:48,382 --> 00:54:50,265
MATT: "That's the first true thing you've said

1584
00:54:50,265 --> 00:54:52,408
"since you've called me out of my home."

1585
00:54:52,408 --> 00:54:53,833
LIAM: Stay with me on this.

1586
00:54:53,833 --> 00:54:56,069
We are strangers in a strange land.

1587
00:54:56,069 --> 00:54:58,657
However, we are working
with Lord Greyspine

1588
00:54:58,657 --> 00:55:01,464
to empty your mines and end the evil

1589
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:02,940
that is spewing forth from them.

1590
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:05,578
Now I know that we are a bit stupid--

1591
00:55:05,578 --> 00:55:06,539
(group laughs)

1592
00:55:06,539 --> 00:55:07,770
--in a number of ways.

1593
00:55:07,770 --> 00:55:09,140
LAURA: But we fight well.

1594
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:11,927
LIAM: But we fight well, and we
have the best of intentions,

1595
00:55:11,927 --> 00:55:15,196
and when it counts, we're there.

1596
00:55:15,196 --> 00:55:18,791
We just need a little bit of
help going into the mines.

1597
00:55:18,791 --> 00:55:21,593
And again, Lord Greyspine himself sent us,

1598
00:55:21,593 --> 00:55:23,409
so please excuse my--

1599
00:55:23,409 --> 00:55:24,452
TALIEISIN: Cornwall?

1600
00:55:24,452 --> 00:55:25,838
LIAM: --challenged friends.

1601
00:55:25,838 --> 00:55:27,130
TRAVIS: My cornhole friends.

1602
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:29,065
LIAM: We're here to help.

1603
00:55:29,065 --> 00:55:29,898
I promise.

1604
00:55:31,166 --> 00:55:33,149
TRAVIS: That's a very Disney moment.

1605
00:55:33,149 --> 00:55:35,184
LIAM: Wink, wink, wink.

1606
00:55:35,184 --> 00:55:36,477
LAURA: I wink twice.

1607
00:55:36,477 --> 00:55:37,818
Make a persuasion roll at disadvantage.

1608
00:55:37,818 --> 00:55:39,716
LAURA: Can I assist him 'cause I winked?

1609
00:55:39,716 --> 00:55:40,549
MATT: No.

1610
00:55:40,549 --> 00:55:41,382
LAURA: Damn it.

1611
00:55:41,382 --> 00:55:42,375
TRAVIS: It's a powerful wink.

1612
00:55:42,376 --> 00:55:44,550
MATT: It's a powerful wink,
but not this powerful.

1613
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:46,695
Not the way this
conversation's been going.

1614
00:55:46,695 --> 00:55:47,748
TRAVIS: Yeah, apparently not.

1615
00:55:47,748 --> 00:55:48,581
Oh hello!

1616
00:55:48,581 --> 00:55:50,437
LIAM: Best roll of the night.

1617
00:55:50,437 --> 00:55:52,853
I rolled a 20 and a 17.

1618
00:55:52,853 --> 00:55:53,904
So 19.

1619
00:55:53,904 --> 00:55:54,737
MATT: 19.

1620
00:55:57,235 --> 00:55:59,865
He glares at you two and goes,

1621
00:55:59,865 --> 00:56:01,695
"I've said my piece.

1622
00:56:01,695 --> 00:56:02,528
Good luck to you all."

1623
00:56:02,528 --> 00:56:03,361
(group groans)

1624
00:56:03,361 --> 00:56:04,665
SAM: Further.

1625
00:56:04,665 --> 00:56:06,109
LAURA: If you had gotten the 20.

1626
00:56:06,109 --> 00:56:07,287
LIAM: How about a chocolate-covered mallomar?

1627
00:56:07,287 --> 00:56:08,534
SAM: I'm gonna have one more try at this.

1628
00:56:08,534 --> 00:56:09,367
MATT: He turns around and starts walking away.

1629
00:56:09,367 --> 00:56:11,707
SAM: There must be so many
arcane things down there

1630
00:56:11,707 --> 00:56:13,613
that we will discover and bring to you

1631
00:56:13,613 --> 00:56:15,113
upon finding them.

1632
00:56:15,113 --> 00:56:16,466
LAURA: Good call, Scanlan.

1633
00:56:16,466 --> 00:56:18,936
SAM: Things that you could
use for your research.

1634
00:56:18,936 --> 00:56:19,963
Historical items.

1635
00:56:19,963 --> 00:56:22,178
MATT: As he's still walking
away, you hear him shout

1636
00:56:22,178 --> 00:56:23,342
over his shoulder,

1637
00:56:23,342 --> 00:56:26,301
"And when you bring them, then we'll talk!"

1638
00:56:26,301 --> 00:56:27,587
SAM: Okay, that's fair.

1639
00:56:27,587 --> 00:56:30,057
MATT: "Till then, good day, and don't bother me

1640
00:56:30,057 --> 00:56:31,078
when I'm eating."

1641
00:56:31,078 --> 00:56:32,872
LAURA: Thank you, Lord Thunderclap.

1642
00:56:32,872 --> 00:56:35,298
LIAM: This game has consequences.

1643
00:56:35,298 --> 00:56:36,364
MATT: At which he shouts again

1644
00:56:36,364 --> 00:56:39,268
at a booming, booming
prestidigitation voice,

1645
00:56:40,568 --> 00:56:43,488
"It's THUNDERBRAND!"

1646
00:56:43,816 --> 00:56:45,649
LAURA: That's what I meant.

1647
00:56:46,366 --> 00:56:47,965
MATT: You hear the door slam, boom!

1648
00:56:47,965 --> 00:56:49,101
TRAVIS: That was fun.

1649
00:56:49,101 --> 00:56:50,284
SAM: That was great!

1650
00:56:50,284 --> 00:56:51,970
LAURA: Should we go buy some potions then?

1651
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:53,273
TALIESIN: Yes, let's go buy some potions.

1652
00:56:53,273 --> 00:56:55,253
SAM: He gave us a little bit of information.

1653
00:56:55,253 --> 00:56:57,324
The valve of valva, what's it? Valor of -

1654
00:56:57,324 --> 00:56:58,477
TRAVIS: Vulva?

1655
00:56:58,487 --> 00:57:00,050
SAM: The place to place to go buy potions.

1656
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:01,543
ORION: The House of Valor.

1657
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:02,956
SAM: No, the valva--

1658
00:57:02,956 --> 00:57:04,945
ORION: It's not the
House of Vulva, Scanlan.

1659
00:57:04,945 --> 00:57:06,157
MATT: The Value of Valor.

1660
00:57:06,157 --> 00:57:07,738
LAURA AND SAM: The Value of Valor!

1661
00:57:07,738 --> 00:57:09,732
TRAVIS: If you want to visit the House of Vulva,

1662
00:57:09,732 --> 00:57:11,705
you and I can go later but not now.

1663
00:57:11,705 --> 00:57:14,605
LAURA: The Value of Valor, let's go find that.

1664
00:57:14,605 --> 00:57:17,374
ORION: (in Marisha's bad accent)
Let's go to the North.

1665
00:57:17,374 --> 00:57:18,669
MARISHA: I'm sorry.

1666
00:57:18,669 --> 00:57:20,579
I didn't think about the fact that I was

1667
00:57:20,579 --> 00:57:22,119
gonna have to do an accent.

1668
00:57:22,119 --> 00:57:23,650
I'm not good with that stuff.

1669
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:25,126
LAURA: It's okay, Keyleth.

1670
00:57:25,126 --> 00:57:27,064
TRAVIS: Women, fighting, ale, that's my job.

1671
00:57:27,064 --> 00:57:29,177
MATT: So after a bit of discussion,
you manage to make your way

1672
00:57:29,177 --> 00:57:30,010
around town.

1673
00:57:30,010 --> 00:57:31,660
You eventually find your
way to the Value of Valor,

1674
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:32,493
which is a--

1675
00:57:32,493 --> 00:57:33,610
LAURA: Terrible.

1676
00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:35,554
MATT: (laughs) It's a stone building.

1677
00:57:35,554 --> 00:57:37,703
Like reddish brick,
it looks in construction.

1678
00:57:37,703 --> 00:57:39,329
With fine purple--

1679
00:57:39,329 --> 00:57:42,196
LAURA: Please be open, please
be open, please be open.

1680
00:57:42,196 --> 00:57:44,464
MATT: (laughs) Fine purple
tapestries in the front

1681
00:57:44,464 --> 00:57:47,894
that show various battles
of old dwarven history

1682
00:57:47,894 --> 00:57:51,509
of two glowing enchanted
permalight lanterns

1683
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:53,360
hanging from the front.

1684
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:54,193
TALIESIN: Classy.

1685
00:57:54,193 --> 00:57:56,987
MATT: And an entryway that is currently open

1686
00:57:56,987 --> 00:57:59,705
and a warmly-lit interior welcomes you.

1687
00:57:59,705 --> 00:58:00,628
TRAVIS: Awesome.

1688
00:58:00,628 --> 00:58:01,494
LIAM: So easy.

1689
00:58:01,494 --> 00:58:03,037
SAM: Hey, before we go in there

1690
00:58:03,037 --> 00:58:05,775
and just make asses of ourselves,

1691
00:58:05,775 --> 00:58:08,900
As a group, what do you
think we need to get down

1692
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:09,733
into these mines?

1693
00:58:09,733 --> 00:58:10,566
LAURA: Potions.

1694
00:58:10,566 --> 00:58:11,965
TALIESIN: Healing potions.

1695
00:58:11,965 --> 00:58:13,738
SAM: Healing potions.
Some light sources--

1696
00:58:13,738 --> 00:58:14,731
ORION: We don't need that.

1697
00:58:14,731 --> 00:58:15,932
SAM: Climbing anything?

1698
00:58:15,932 --> 00:58:17,235
LAURA: I have climbing gear.

1699
00:58:17,235 --> 00:58:18,744
SAM: I have some climbing gear, but--

1700
00:58:18,744 --> 00:58:20,796
LAURA: That's included in
the dungeoneering kit, right?

1701
00:58:20,796 --> 00:58:21,629
MATT: Yes.

1702
00:58:21,629 --> 00:58:23,902
SAM: Oh, what about something for breathing?

1703
00:58:23,902 --> 00:58:26,159
SAM: Like what if we get trapped
down there with no air?

1704
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:28,189
ORION: Don't worry about that.

1705
00:58:28,189 --> 00:58:31,566
LAURA: She can make plants, and
we'll get plenty of oxygen.

1706
00:58:31,566 --> 00:58:33,340
MARISHA: Oxygen's good, although
if we have something

1707
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:35,837
to help with poison, that might be good.

1708
00:58:35,837 --> 00:58:37,540
Can we get some antidotes?

1709
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:39,963
LIAM: Vex.
How much gold do we have at the moment?

1710
00:58:40,631 --> 00:58:43,358
LAURA: That is a wonderful question, brother.

1711
00:58:43,358 --> 00:58:45,772
ORION: By the way, I pull out a bottle of air.

1712
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:48,917
Just an empty bottle and
go: and plus, we have this.

1713
00:58:48,917 --> 00:58:53,014
LAURA: We will more than double our
gold if we take this mission.

1714
00:58:53,014 --> 00:58:55,176
TRAVIS: So we got like 24,000 gold pieces?

1715
00:58:55,176 --> 00:58:56,435
LAURA: Less than that.

1716
00:58:56,435 --> 00:58:57,339
TRAVIS: 23 thousand.

1717
00:58:57,339 --> 00:58:58,172
LAURA: Less than that.

1718
00:58:58,172 --> 00:58:59,005
TRAVIS: 22 thousand?

1719
00:58:59,005 --> 00:59:00,477
LIAM: More than double, that means
it could be one thousand.

1720
00:59:00,477 --> 00:59:02,260
'Cause anything is more than double.

1721
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:03,593
LAURA: I don't like sharing.

1722
00:59:03,593 --> 00:59:04,723
TRAVIS: Math is stupid.

1723
00:59:04,723 --> 00:59:07,074
SAM: All right, we go into the House of Vulva.

1724
00:59:07,074 --> 00:59:07,907
MATT: All right.

1725
00:59:08,611 --> 00:59:10,222
SAM: Open your vulva!

1726
00:59:10,222 --> 00:59:13,315
MATT: That's not what it's called.

1727
00:59:13,315 --> 00:59:16,669
(group laughs)

1728
00:59:16,669 --> 00:59:19,580
TRAVIS: Are you sure you don't wanna
think about renaming it now?

1729
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:23,685
MATT: It's the Value of Valor guys, come on! (whines)

1730
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:25,445
MATT: All right, so.

1731
00:59:25,445 --> 00:59:27,030
TALIESIN: You're tearing the party apart.

1732
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:29,026
LIAM: Tearing me apart, Lisa.

1733
00:59:29,026 --> 00:59:31,506
MATT: A giant boulder falls out of nowhere
and crushes Grog.

1734
00:59:31,506 --> 00:59:32,612
(group laughs)

1735
00:59:32,612 --> 00:59:34,936
MATT: So you make your way inside.

1736
00:59:34,936 --> 00:59:39,468
Suddenly, hit with the smell
of heavy incense and jasmine.

1737
00:59:39,468 --> 00:59:41,865
This is the equivalent of
a Psychic Eye Bookshop.

1738
00:59:41,865 --> 00:59:42,850
ORION: Groovy!

1739
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:44,197
MARISHA: Oh, we were just there.

1740
00:59:44,197 --> 00:59:45,030
TALIESIN: We were just there.

1741
00:59:45,030 --> 00:59:45,863
TRAVIS: Nag champa.

1742
00:59:45,863 --> 00:59:47,074
MATT: You walk inside.

1743
00:59:47,074 --> 00:59:48,542
There's not a lot of folks inside

1744
00:59:48,542 --> 00:59:50,483
looking about the establishment.

1745
00:59:50,483 --> 00:59:53,678
But there is one person
sitting at the front desk,

1746
00:59:53,678 --> 00:59:55,750
which is a beautiful long oak table

1747
00:59:55,750 --> 00:59:59,071
with a red trim
that hangs to the ceiling.

1748
00:59:59,071 --> 01:00:00,098
Not a dwarf, actually.

1749
01:00:00,098 --> 01:00:02,944
What you see there appears
to be an elven individual,

1750
01:00:02,944 --> 01:00:05,234
sitting at wait, hair
pulled back behind the ears.

1751
01:00:05,234 --> 01:00:07,682
Very, very slight, thin build.

1752
01:00:07,682 --> 01:00:09,831
And smiles as you enter and says,

1753
01:00:09,831 --> 01:00:12,641
"Welcome to my establishment,
may I help you?"

1754
01:00:12,641 --> 01:00:15,787
LAURA: We both stand a little taller,
and try to look more noble.

1755
01:00:15,787 --> 01:00:16,620
LIAM: Hello.

1756
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:17,453
MATT: "Yes."

1757
01:00:17,453 --> 01:00:19,907
LIAM: It's a beautiful shop you have.

1758
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:23,636
It's so startling to find
an elven establishment here

1759
01:00:23,636 --> 01:00:25,807
in the middle of Kraghammer.

1760
01:00:25,807 --> 01:00:27,392
How did this come about?

1761
01:00:27,392 --> 01:00:28,352
MATT: "Well.

1762
01:00:29,372 --> 01:00:30,653
"They didn't have one."

1763
01:00:30,653 --> 01:00:32,824
(Travis and Sam laugh)

1764
01:00:32,824 --> 01:00:35,292
"And I found there was
perhaps money to be made

1765
01:00:35,292 --> 01:00:37,081
"in starting one.

1766
01:00:37,081 --> 01:00:39,316
"I've been here for over a hundred years."

1767
01:00:39,316 --> 01:00:41,930
TRAVIS: Oh sh--
Are you guys that old?

1768
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:42,160
LIAM: No, we are not.

1769
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:43,538
ORION: So business is good?

1770
01:00:43,538 --> 01:00:45,231
MATT: "Dwarves have a hard time

1771
01:00:45,231 --> 01:00:47,161
"buying from those
who are not dwarves.

1772
01:00:47,161 --> 01:00:49,033
"But I've made my established connections
with business individuals.

1773
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:54,210
"So, what can I help you with?

1774
01:00:54,210 --> 01:00:56,852
TALIESIN: We're in the market for
some healing potions

1775
01:00:56,852 --> 01:00:58,055
to start with.

1776
01:00:58,055 --> 01:00:59,333
TRAVIS: Yep, yep.

1777
01:00:59,333 --> 01:01:01,885
MATT: "Of which intensity are you looking for?"

1778
01:01:02,012 --> 01:01:04,704
TRAVIS:: Level three for this one, please.

1779
01:01:04,704 --> 01:01:05,680
Two.

1780
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:08,497
MATT: "So looking for a superior healing potion."

1781
01:01:08,497 --> 01:01:09,914
TRAVIS: Yeah, superior.

1782
01:01:09,914 --> 01:01:12,461
MATT: "I've only got two of those currently."

1783
01:01:12,461 --> 01:01:14,628
LAURA: They're expensive, Grog.

1784
01:01:14,628 --> 01:01:16,799
MARISHA: We don't have Pike, though.

1785
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:19,514
MATT: "I can sell you the two
superior healing potions."

1786
01:01:19,514 --> 01:01:21,412
MARISHA: I'm still not feeling well.

1787
01:01:21,412 --> 01:01:24,180
MATT: "Those will run you 1,500 gold pieces each."

1788
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:24,993
TRAVIS: Fuck!

1789
01:01:24,993 --> 01:01:26,012
Really?!

1790
01:01:26,012 --> 01:01:28,778
TALIESIN: This is why you buy
medium healing potions.

1791
01:01:28,778 --> 01:01:31,700
MARISHA: On second thought, I'll just
read some books tonight,

1792
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:33,235
TRAVIS: I take damage <i>fast</i>.

1793
01:01:33,235 --> 01:01:35,258
MARISHA: Refresh myself on my healing spells.

1794
01:01:35,258 --> 01:01:37,091
LAURA: Can I ask your name?

1795
01:01:37,091 --> 01:01:39,977
MATT: He gives you a keen
look and says, "Tremaine."

1796
01:01:39,977 --> 01:01:41,267
LAURA: Tremaine.

1797
01:01:41,267 --> 01:01:42,736
TRAVIS: Oh, here we go.

1798
01:01:42,736 --> 01:01:44,059
(Liam and Taliesin laugh)

1799
01:01:44,059 --> 01:01:45,263
MARISHA: It's what she's good at.

1800
01:01:45,263 --> 01:01:47,173
TRAVIS: Everybody take five while we haggle.

1801
01:01:47,173 --> 01:01:48,317
LAURA: I'm just saying.

1802
01:01:48,317 --> 01:01:50,205
We're heading into the mines.

1803
01:01:50,205 --> 01:01:52,076
We are going to encounter very many

1804
01:01:52,076 --> 01:01:54,326
arcane objects potentially.

1805
01:01:55,506 --> 01:01:57,743
In fact, Lord Thunderbrand
sent us over here.

1806
01:01:57,743 --> 01:01:59,176
That's his name, right?

1807
01:01:59,176 --> 01:02:00,339
TRAVIS: You got it.

1808
01:02:00,339 --> 01:02:01,776
TALIESIN: You did it right.

1809
01:02:01,776 --> 01:02:04,614
LAURA: Sent us over here telling
us to find his wares here.

1810
01:02:04,614 --> 01:02:06,398
And we've made a deal with him

1811
01:02:06,398 --> 01:02:10,565
that if we find arcane
objects we could potentially,

1812
01:02:14,517 --> 01:02:17,330
you know, I lost track
of what I was saying,

1813
01:02:17,330 --> 01:02:19,053
but you get the idea.

1814
01:02:19,053 --> 01:02:20,078
SAM: Oh boy.

1815
01:02:20,078 --> 01:02:21,203
ORION: What would you suggest?

1816
01:02:21,203 --> 01:02:23,787
And do you know of any
things we should particularly

1817
01:02:23,787 --> 01:02:25,820
buy before we leave going into the mines

1818
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:27,853
and encountering nasty naga-type creatures

1819
01:02:27,853 --> 01:02:29,621
and other kind of things.

1820
01:02:29,621 --> 01:02:31,384
MATT: "Superior healing potions."

1821
01:02:31,384 --> 01:02:33,180
TRAVIS: How much are they each, 1500?

1822
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:34,640
MATT: "1500 gold pieces."

1823
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,245
TRAVIS: I'll take one for me, thank you.

1824
01:02:36,245 --> 01:02:37,118
MATT: "Very well."

1825
01:02:37,118 --> 01:02:40,026
LAURA: We'll very much like to
perhaps make a deal with you,

1826
01:02:40,026 --> 01:02:42,192
that we'll bring you
objects of arcane nature

1827
01:02:42,192 --> 01:02:44,609
for a discount on your wares.

1828
01:02:46,912 --> 01:02:48,455
MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

1829
01:02:48,455 --> 01:02:49,288
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

1830
01:02:49,288 --> 01:02:50,121
I just paid for--

1831
01:02:50,121 --> 01:02:51,403
LAURA: Oh, no you didn't.

1832
01:02:51,403 --> 01:02:52,262
Not yet.

1833
01:02:52,262 --> 01:02:53,095
LIAM: Roll, sister.

1834
01:02:53,095 --> 01:02:56,716
LAURA: Oh, come on, no whammies, no whammies.

1835
01:02:56,716 --> 01:02:57,897
Okay, well.

1836
01:02:57,897 --> 01:02:58,730
15, hm?

1837
01:03:00,107 --> 01:03:01,607
TRAVIS: He's an old elf.

1838
01:03:03,241 --> 01:03:04,074
MATT: He says,

1839
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:08,937
"And I appreciate this perhaps offer.

1840
01:03:08,937 --> 01:03:11,022
"Once you return from your mines--"

1841
01:03:11,022 --> 01:03:12,480
LAURA: I know, I know, I know.

1842
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,139
MATT: "--with these magical accoutrements,

1843
01:03:14,139 --> 01:03:15,483
you are more than welcome
to bring them here,

1844
01:03:15,483 --> 01:03:17,211
and we'll make a deal.

1845
01:03:17,211 --> 01:03:20,561
LAURA: How many dragons have
you come across, sir?

1846
01:03:20,561 --> 01:03:22,391
Are you interested in dragon parts?

1847
01:03:22,391 --> 01:03:24,698
TRAVIS: Oh, we have a lot of dragon bits.

1848
01:03:24,698 --> 01:03:27,316
MATT: He extends his hand to a shelf on the side

1849
01:03:27,316 --> 01:03:28,832
labeled, "Dragon Parts."

1850
01:03:28,832 --> 01:03:29,665
LAURA: Oh.

1851
01:03:29,665 --> 01:03:30,596
(group laughs)

1852
01:03:30,596 --> 01:03:32,209
LAURA: Lovely.

1853
01:03:32,488 --> 01:03:35,398
MATT: "And to answer your question, three."

1854
01:03:35,398 --> 01:03:36,298
LAURA: Oh, really?

1855
01:03:36,298 --> 01:03:37,471
TRAVIS: What about basilisk eggs?

1856
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:39,606
LAURA: What kind of dragons, actually?

1857
01:03:39,606 --> 01:03:41,126
MATT: "What was your question, sir?"

1858
01:03:41,126 --> 01:03:45,697
TRAVIS: We have also, if you're
interested in trade,

1859
01:03:45,697 --> 01:03:49,114
basilisk eggs and parts of an umber hulk.

1860
01:03:50,233 --> 01:03:51,638
LIAM: And a troll dick.

1861
01:03:51,638 --> 01:03:52,856
TRAVIS: No, that's gone.

1862
01:03:52,856 --> 01:03:53,994
(group laughs)

1863
01:03:53,994 --> 01:03:57,123
TRAVIS: We flogged him with it
and then it disappeared.

1864
01:03:57,123 --> 01:03:58,873
LIAM: I detract my offer.

1865
01:04:00,049 --> 01:04:02,049
TRAVIS: It was used very well.

1866
01:04:05,443 --> 01:04:08,425
MATT: He gives you a very concerned look.

1867
01:04:08,425 --> 01:04:10,217
TRAVIS: I'm a collector of sorts.

1868
01:04:10,217 --> 01:04:11,925
MATT: Both of you. And he goes,

1869
01:04:11,925 --> 01:04:12,925
And he goes,

1870
01:04:15,619 --> 01:04:19,786
"I work in trade, meaning
gold pieces for my wares."

1871
01:04:19,786 --> 01:04:20,619
LAURA: Yes.

1872
01:04:20,619 --> 01:04:22,664
MATT: "If you have interest, purchase.

1873
01:04:22,664 --> 01:04:25,534
"If not, I have other
business to attend to."

1874
01:04:25,534 --> 01:04:27,534
SAM: Any other healing potions to buy?

1875
01:04:27,534 --> 01:04:28,526
Come on people.

1876
01:04:28,526 --> 01:04:29,697
LAURA: Maybe a moderate.

1877
01:04:29,697 --> 01:04:32,344
LIAM: All right, well friends,
we're about to descend

1878
01:04:32,344 --> 01:04:33,213
into hell itself,

1879
01:04:33,213 --> 01:04:35,453
so I reckon we should probably
pay the price.

1880
01:04:35,453 --> 01:04:36,887
TALIESIN: Two moderates.

1881
01:04:36,887 --> 01:04:38,650
MATT: Greater. In the new edition.

1882
01:04:38,650 --> 01:04:39,681
TALIESIN: Greater.

1883
01:04:39,681 --> 01:04:42,191
MARISHA: How much are the greaters?

1884
01:04:42,191 --> 01:04:45,353
MATT: "The greater healing potions
run 300 gold apiece."

1885
01:04:45,353 --> 01:04:46,451
LAURA: Oh, let's get a few of those.

1886
01:04:46,451 --> 01:04:50,213
TRAVIS: I need like three of those.

1887
01:04:50,213 --> 01:04:51,046
MATT: "So, three?"

1888
01:04:51,046 --> 01:04:51,879
TRAVIS: Yeah, three.

1889
01:04:51,879 --> 01:04:53,571
LAURA: Do you have any arrows that--

1890
01:04:53,571 --> 01:04:55,602
TRAVIS: Well let's do the potions first.

1891
01:04:55,602 --> 01:04:57,552
LAURA: Okay okay okay, two for me.

1892
01:04:57,552 --> 01:04:58,735
MATT: "So, five."

1893
01:04:58,735 --> 01:05:00,051
TALIESIN: Two for me as well.

1894
01:05:00,051 --> 01:05:00,884
MATT: "Seven."

1895
01:05:00,884 --> 01:05:01,717
TRAVIS: Keyleth.

1896
01:05:01,717 --> 01:05:02,550
MARISHA: I'll take one.

1897
01:05:02,550 --> 01:05:03,383
MATT: "Eight."

1898
01:05:03,383 --> 01:05:04,216
TRAVIS: Tiberius?

1899
01:05:04,216 --> 01:05:06,429
MATT: "Anyone else require a
moderate healing potion?"

1900
01:05:06,429 --> 01:05:07,514
TRAVIS: Tiberius?

1901
01:05:07,514 --> 01:05:08,734
ORION: I could take one.

1902
01:05:08,734 --> 01:05:10,047
MATT: Pathfinder to 5E.

1903
01:05:10,047 --> 01:05:10,880
TRAVIS: Scanlan?

1904
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:13,462
SAM: Well, do we have ours leftover
from what we had before?

1905
01:05:13,462 --> 01:05:15,218
[LAURA, TRAVIS, MATT] Yes.

1906
01:05:15,218 --> 01:05:16,695
SAM: Then I'm fine.

1907
01:05:16,695 --> 01:05:18,418
TRAVIS: Vax?
LAURA: He's Vax.

1908
01:05:18,418 --> 01:05:20,690
LIAM: No, I'm good actually.
LAURA: He's Vax.

1909
01:05:20,690 --> 01:05:22,519
TRAVIS: Oh, my intelligence is six.

1910
01:05:22,519 --> 01:05:25,071
LIAM: I'm so fast I don't
really use them that much.

1911
01:05:25,071 --> 01:05:25,903
TRAVIS: So nine.

1912
01:05:25,903 --> 01:05:27,306
LIAM: You'll get to that point as well.

1913
01:05:27,306 --> 01:05:28,343
LAURA: Nine potions then.

1914
01:05:28,343 --> 01:05:30,488
TRAVIS: Nine times 300, work that out.

1915
01:05:30,488 --> 01:05:33,950
MATT: As he pulls up his arcane calculator.

1916
01:05:33,950 --> 01:05:35,806
LAURA: So 2500 for all nine then.

1917
01:05:35,806 --> 01:05:38,063
TALIESIN: It's an abacus, God, abacus!

1918
01:05:38,063 --> 01:05:41,068
TRAVIS: I believe it's 2700 gold pieces?

1919
01:05:41,068 --> 01:05:42,966
LAURA: Why would you do that?

1920
01:05:42,966 --> 01:05:43,799
I was trying to make him--

1921
01:05:43,799 --> 01:05:45,540
MATT: "It is 27."

1922
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:48,123
MATT: He says, "Impressive for a goliath.

1923
01:05:50,472 --> 01:05:52,940
"I don't mean to assume,
but in my experiences,

1924
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:54,193
"your kind is--

1925
01:05:54,193 --> 01:05:57,238
TRAVIS: It's Professor Grog, actually.

1926
01:05:57,238 --> 01:05:59,414
ORION: All right, calm down.

1927
01:05:59,414 --> 01:06:03,437
MATT: "2700 gold pieces for your
nine greater healing potions."

1928
01:06:03,437 --> 01:06:04,604
LAURA: All right, 27.

1929
01:06:05,663 --> 01:06:07,009
Do you have any arrows

1930
01:06:07,009 --> 01:06:10,092
that perhaps have magical properties?

1931
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:13,041
ORION: Enchanted arrows is
what she's asking for.

1932
01:06:13,041 --> 01:06:13,924
LAURA: Yes.

1933
01:06:13,924 --> 01:06:16,473
MATT: He kind of glances over
his shoulder and says,

1934
01:06:16,473 --> 01:06:19,472
"Ah, we haven't had much a
request for arrows in a while.

1935
01:06:19,472 --> 01:06:22,942
"We have bolts for crossbows,
as that seems to be the staple

1936
01:06:22,942 --> 01:06:24,971
"for the carvers of the city.

1937
01:06:24,971 --> 01:06:27,308
"I have two sleep arrows,
perhaps, if that is

1938
01:06:27,308 --> 01:06:28,474
"of interest to you."

1939
01:06:28,474 --> 01:06:29,732
ORION: Yes they would be, very much.

1940
01:06:29,732 --> 01:06:32,694
LAURA: And what would you charge for those, sir?

1941
01:06:34,861 --> 01:06:37,184
TALIESIN: Ooh, I should build
some interesting arrows.

1942
01:06:37,184 --> 01:06:38,706
MARISHA: You should.

1943
01:06:38,706 --> 01:06:39,751
MATT: Arrows.

1944
01:06:39,751 --> 01:06:43,465
(whispering and muttering)

1945
01:06:43,465 --> 01:06:47,216
MATT: "That would run you 250 gold per arrow.

1946
01:06:47,216 --> 01:06:48,321
"I have two currently."

1947
01:06:48,321 --> 01:06:50,005
LAURA: All right, all right, I'll take 'em.

1948
01:06:50,005 --> 01:06:51,621
MATT: "All right, 500 gold.

1949
01:06:51,621 --> 01:06:54,783
"With that, that is a
total of 3200 gold pieces."

1950
01:06:54,783 --> 01:06:57,748
TRAVIS: Scanlan, underwater breathing
or air, oxygen supplies?

1951
01:06:57,748 --> 01:07:00,388
ORION: Dear sir, have you happened upon any--

1952
01:07:00,388 --> 01:07:01,541
TRAVIS: Ask with your fancy talk.

1953
01:07:01,541 --> 01:07:03,458
ORION: --relic or artifact around here, or heard

1954
01:07:03,458 --> 01:07:06,599
of something called the Pale Stone?

1955
01:07:06,599 --> 01:07:08,703
LAURA: Sorry, you have to watch us buy things.

1956
01:07:08,703 --> 01:07:11,649
ORION: This is a rare artifact
I've been looking for

1957
01:07:11,649 --> 01:07:13,082
for quite some time.

1958
01:07:13,082 --> 01:07:15,318
ORION: I figured an environment
like this might lend to something.

1959
01:07:15,318 --> 01:07:16,831
LAURA: What is it a mess you've made?

1960
01:07:16,831 --> 01:07:19,812
MATT: "I don't believe I have, but
should you come across one,

1961
01:07:19,812 --> 01:07:21,996
"I would be interested to have a look."

1962
01:07:21,996 --> 01:07:23,285
ORION: Oh, you appraise?

1963
01:07:23,285 --> 01:07:24,938
MATT: "If you don't mind."

1964
01:07:24,938 --> 01:07:25,850
ORION: Very good.

1965
01:07:25,850 --> 01:07:29,255
SAM: And do you have anything
for adventuring underwater

1966
01:07:29,255 --> 01:07:33,315
or for helping to breathe in tight spaces?

1967
01:07:33,315 --> 01:07:36,386
MATT: "Mm, potion of waterbreathing,
I do happen to have."

1968
01:07:36,386 --> 01:07:37,219
SAM: A potion of waterbreathing?

1969
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:38,228
MATT: "Yes, I do."

1970
01:07:38,228 --> 01:07:39,297
SAM: How much?

1971
01:07:39,297 --> 01:07:40,891
MATT: "I have four of them available,

1972
01:07:40,891 --> 01:07:42,610
"and they run 500 gold apiece."

1973
01:07:42,610 --> 01:07:43,443
SAM: Jesus.

1974
01:07:43,443 --> 01:07:44,443
TRAVIS: We'll take it.

1975
01:07:44,443 --> 01:07:45,654
We got all this platinum I forgot about.

1976
01:07:45,654 --> 01:07:46,993
SAM: Take one, two, one?

1977
01:07:46,993 --> 01:07:48,398
LAURA: Don't say that!

1978
01:07:48,398 --> 01:07:49,669
TRAVIS: He can't hear--

1979
01:07:49,669 --> 01:07:50,816
ORION: I don't need one.

1980
01:07:50,816 --> 01:07:52,294
I bring out my bottle of air.

1981
01:07:52,294 --> 01:07:53,535
And I go, "I have this."

1982
01:07:53,535 --> 01:07:54,638
And I put it back in.

1983
01:07:54,638 --> 01:07:55,471
SAM: I'm okay as well.

1984
01:07:55,471 --> 01:07:56,783
You want one, Grog?

1985
01:07:56,783 --> 01:07:57,616
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1986
01:07:57,616 --> 01:07:59,554
SAM: All right, we'll just take one of those.

1987
01:07:59,554 --> 01:08:00,387
TRAVIS: Just one?

1988
01:08:00,387 --> 01:08:02,040
SAM: Well, I don't need it.

1989
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:02,873
He doesn't need it.

1990
01:08:02,873 --> 01:08:03,796
TRAVIS: We'll take two.

1991
01:08:03,799 --> 01:08:04,632
SAM: Two.

1992
01:08:04,632 --> 01:08:05,865
MATT: "1000 gold.

1993
01:08:05,865 --> 01:08:07,439
"That brings us to 4200 gold."

1994
01:08:07,439 --> 01:08:08,722
LAURA: Wait, 42?

1995
01:08:08,722 --> 01:08:09,555
MATT: "Yes."

1996
01:08:10,679 --> 01:08:14,488
LIAM: Have you any elven gear
for a son of Syngorn?

1997
01:08:14,488 --> 01:08:16,325
LAURA: Are you taking it off of your pot now?

1998
01:08:16,325 --> 01:08:17,078
TRAVIS: Yep.

1999
01:08:17,432 --> 01:08:20,599
MATT: He gives you a keen look and goes,

2000
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:23,345
"We don't get many requests for this,

2001
01:08:23,345 --> 01:08:24,904
"but I think this may fit you."

2002
01:08:24,904 --> 01:08:27,788
And he reaches below and
pulls up a fine piece

2003
01:08:27,788 --> 01:08:30,058
of mithril chain, elven in make.

2004
01:08:30,058 --> 01:08:31,511
LAURA: That's what I'm wearing.

2005
01:08:31,511 --> 01:08:32,344
MATT: Mm hm.

2006
01:08:32,344 --> 01:08:33,261
TRAVIS: Show-off.

2007
01:08:36,545 --> 01:08:38,848
MATT: He says, "Would you perhaps

2008
01:08:38,848 --> 01:08:40,655
"be interested in this elven chain?"

2009
01:08:41,394 --> 01:08:42,810
LIAM: It's beautiful.

2010
01:08:44,658 --> 01:08:47,408
I am a bit of a light-footed one.

2011
01:08:48,658 --> 01:08:50,895
Would it suit me?

2012
01:08:50,895 --> 01:08:52,060
MATT: "Hm.

2013
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:54,267
"Chain does make a bit of a racket.

2014
01:08:54,267 --> 01:08:56,684
"Might not recommend it, unfortunately."

2015
01:08:56,684 --> 01:08:57,927
LIAM: All right.
I'll pass.

2016
01:08:57,927 --> 01:08:59,618
TRAVIS: You couldn't buy it for me?

2017
01:08:59,618 --> 01:09:01,139
LAURA: It won't fit you, it's for elves.

2018
01:09:01,139 --> 01:09:02,156
LIAM: You're gigantic.

2019
01:09:02,156 --> 01:09:04,411
TRAVIS: Could go on my pinky or something.

2020
01:09:04,411 --> 01:09:05,852
LAURA: All right, cool.

2021
01:09:05,852 --> 01:09:07,309
LIAM: Could fit on your left nut.

2022
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:08,119
LAURA: Well, thanks.

2023
01:09:08,119 --> 01:09:10,122
TRAVIS: That's an important nut.

2024
01:09:10,122 --> 01:09:11,635
MATT: He goes ahead and accepts your gold.

2025
01:09:11,635 --> 01:09:13,118
Go ahead and mark off 4200 gold for those.

2026
01:09:13,118 --> 01:09:14,076
LAURA: I did already.

2027
01:09:14,076 --> 01:09:15,725
MATT: All right, very well.

2028
01:09:15,725 --> 01:09:18,035
"Thank you for your patronage.

2029
01:09:18,035 --> 01:09:19,984
"I look forward to
hopefully having you back

2030
01:09:19,984 --> 01:09:24,638
"when you return with whatever
artifacts you manage to find."

2031
01:09:24,638 --> 01:09:25,698
TRAVIS: Thank you, you're very nice.

2032
01:09:25,698 --> 01:09:27,108
LAURA: Big expensive artifacts.

2033
01:09:27,108 --> 01:09:28,378
TALIESIN: I say, you're one of
the most charming people

2034
01:09:28,378 --> 01:09:29,894
we've met so far down here.

2035
01:09:29,894 --> 01:09:31,265
TRAVIS: And it smells pretty in here.

2036
01:09:31,265 --> 01:09:33,653
MATT: "Well of course, they
come in rare ordinance

2037
01:09:33,653 --> 01:09:34,841
in this city, it seems."

2038
01:09:34,841 --> 01:09:37,026
You hear under his breath
a little bit of a mutter.

2039
01:09:37,026 --> 01:09:39,386
Apparently it's like elves
don't like dwarves, it's weird.

2040
01:09:39,386 --> 01:09:42,072
TRAVIS: Do we sleep before we get to go kill shit?

2041
01:09:42,072 --> 01:09:43,538
TALIESIN: We're gonna go sleep.

2042
01:09:43,538 --> 01:09:44,571
TRAVIS: Well can we go do that?

2043
01:09:44,571 --> 01:09:45,636
LAURA: Let's go sleep and then
get up in the morning

2044
01:09:45,636 --> 01:09:47,131
and go down and kill things.

2045
01:09:47,131 --> 01:09:48,179
TALIESIN: And I'd love to do a crafting roll

2046
01:09:48,179 --> 01:09:49,626
right before I go to sleep

2047
01:09:49,626 --> 01:09:51,495
just to put together a little thing.

2048
01:09:51,495 --> 01:09:52,439
MATT: What would you like to put together?

2049
01:09:52,439 --> 01:09:55,227
TALIESIN: I'd like to try and build a
bolo arrow, a trapping arrow.

2050
01:09:55,227 --> 01:09:56,158
TRAVIS: Yeah!

2051
01:09:56,158 --> 01:09:57,685
MATT: Interesting, okay.

2052
01:09:57,685 --> 01:09:59,070
As you guys head back to the inn

2053
01:09:59,070 --> 01:10:00,765
where you've rented rooms for the week,

2054
01:10:00,765 --> 01:10:02,413
TRAVIS: You clever fucker.

2055
01:10:02,413 --> 01:10:05,536
MATT: Which would be at the Iron Hearth Tavern.

2056
01:10:05,536 --> 01:10:06,610
TRAVIS: Is Ballsack in there?

2057
01:10:06,610 --> 01:10:08,079
When we walk in?

2058
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:10,480
MATT: Balgus is not in the tavern, no.

2059
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:11,313
TRAVIS: He's not?

2060
01:10:11,313 --> 01:10:13,396
ORION: He's Balgus, Grog.
MATT: No, sorry.

2061
01:10:13,396 --> 01:10:14,341
TRAVIS: Really?

2062
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:15,870
MATT: He's got a home.

2063
01:10:15,870 --> 01:10:17,642
TRAVIS: Yeah, but doesn't mean
he have to go to it.

2064
01:10:17,642 --> 01:10:18,621
MATT: True.

2065
01:10:18,621 --> 01:10:20,329
LAURA: I walk Trinket down into the storage area

2066
01:10:20,329 --> 01:10:21,162
that he can stay in.

2067
01:10:21,162 --> 01:10:23,168
MATT: [bear noise] Trinket goes down begrudgingly.

2068
01:10:23,168 --> 01:10:24,003
ORION: Damn it.

2069
01:10:24,003 --> 01:10:25,979
LAURA: I look around for something that can

2070
01:10:25,979 --> 01:10:28,229
look like a pillow for him.

2071
01:10:28,229 --> 01:10:29,899
MATT: You find a couple of sacks of grain

2072
01:10:29,899 --> 01:10:31,048
that can probably work.

2073
01:10:31,048 --> 01:10:33,150
LAURA: I put them down and
make them comfy for him.

2074
01:10:33,150 --> 01:10:34,810
MATT: Okay, you think they're probably
not gonna last the night

2075
01:10:34,810 --> 01:10:36,103
with those bear claws.

2076
01:10:36,103 --> 01:10:37,411
But you don't care, it's not your grain.

2077
01:10:37,411 --> 01:10:38,578
LAURA: That's fine.

2078
01:10:38,578 --> 01:10:40,319
Also, I feed him.

2079
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:44,062
MATT: Okay, Trinket is very happy.
(imitates bear eating)

2080
01:10:44,062 --> 01:10:46,298
Tears into some meat.

2081
01:10:46,298 --> 01:10:49,208
You guys make it back to the
tavern for an evening's rest.

2082
01:10:49,208 --> 01:10:50,112
For you--

2083
01:10:50,112 --> 01:10:52,718
TALIESIN: Not a super complicated thing,
but, you know, I've gotta--

2084
01:10:52,718 --> 01:10:55,110
MATT: Go ahead and make a Tinker's Kit roll.

2085
01:10:55,110 --> 01:10:57,269
TALIESIN: What am I rolling with my Tinker's Kit?

2086
01:10:57,269 --> 01:10:58,705
I've never done this before.

2087
01:10:58,705 --> 01:11:00,078
MATT: For this, I would go ahead

2088
01:11:00,078 --> 01:11:02,143
and make it an intellect
modifier to your roll.

2089
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:03,791
TALIESIN: Intellect modifier?

2090
01:11:03,791 --> 01:11:05,659
TRAVIS: Rock that shit, Perce.

2091
01:11:05,659 --> 01:11:08,539
TALIESIN: And I'm spending my bonus die as well.

2092
01:11:08,539 --> 01:11:09,907
LAURA: Oh, we have bonus die, don't we?

2093
01:11:09,907 --> 01:11:10,875
From Scanlan.

2094
01:11:10,875 --> 01:11:13,087
TALIESIN: Thank God, because I rolled really badly.

2095
01:11:13,087 --> 01:11:14,649
10.

2096
01:11:14,649 --> 01:11:15,482
MATT: 10?

2097
01:11:16,405 --> 01:11:19,336
You spend and toil away for
the next four or so hours

2098
01:11:19,336 --> 01:11:22,054
trying to find a way to
get this trigger to work.

2099
01:11:22,054 --> 01:11:24,690
Twice you nearly sprain a finger.

2100
01:11:24,690 --> 01:11:27,032
You manage seemingly get it to function,

2101
01:11:27,032 --> 01:11:29,519
then the arrow itself splits and shatters.

2102
01:11:29,519 --> 01:11:31,681
You can see there being something to it,

2103
01:11:31,681 --> 01:11:33,784
but this night it's not
gonna come to you.

2104
01:11:33,784 --> 01:11:35,659
TALIESIN: I'm gonna have to try again later.

2105
01:11:35,659 --> 01:11:37,013
Okay, that's fine.
It's on the list.

2106
01:11:37,013 --> 01:11:38,290
That was a terrible roll.

2107
01:11:38,290 --> 01:11:39,583
MATT: It was a terrible roll.

2108
01:11:39,583 --> 01:11:40,506
MARISHA: It's been a bad day for rolls.

2109
01:11:40,506 --> 01:11:41,806
It's been bad day for rolling.

2110
01:11:41,806 --> 01:11:42,662
LAURA: Fresh start in the morning.

2111
01:11:42,662 --> 01:11:44,359
SAM: Well, tomorrow is the day that it counts,

2112
01:11:44,359 --> 01:11:45,737
because that's when we
begin to crack some heads.

2113
01:11:45,737 --> 01:11:47,059
LAURA: When we could die.

2114
01:11:47,059 --> 01:11:48,537
TALIESIN: Out with this system, new dice.

2115
01:11:48,537 --> 01:11:50,025
MARISHA: To be fair, it's been a long day.

2116
01:11:50,025 --> 01:11:51,241
I'm still bleeding everywhere.

2117
01:11:51,241 --> 01:11:52,372
SAM: Should we rest and get on with it?

2118
01:11:52,372 --> 01:11:53,205
LAURA: Let's do it!

2119
01:11:53,205 --> 01:11:54,954
SAM: Or should we visit some whorehouses?

2120
01:11:54,954 --> 01:11:56,217
TRAVIS: Nah, let's sleep.

2121
01:11:56,217 --> 01:11:57,730
SAM: Let's just sleep tonight.

2122
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:59,461
LAURA: Just sleep and go.

2123
01:11:59,461 --> 01:12:01,958
TRAVIS: Oh, they're still tired
from the other night.

2124
01:12:01,958 --> 01:12:04,379
SAM: Oh yes, one of them battered me quite--

2125
01:12:04,379 --> 01:12:05,938
TRAVIS: I don't know what this is.

2126
01:12:05,938 --> 01:12:08,397
SAM: That's me getting beaten
up by a whore dwarf.

2127
01:12:08,397 --> 01:12:10,577
TRAVIS: Oh, it's you getting the elbow drop.

2128
01:12:10,577 --> 01:12:12,057
TRAVIS: She's giving you the Randy Savage

2129
01:12:12,057 --> 01:12:13,474
from the bedpost.

2130
01:12:14,393 --> 01:12:15,926
TRAVIS: Oh yeah!

2131
01:12:15,926 --> 01:12:16,793
(crosstalk)

2132
01:12:16,793 --> 01:12:17,699
TRAVIS: We're sleeping now.

2133
01:12:17,699 --> 01:12:18,545
MATT: All right.

2134
01:12:18,545 --> 01:12:19,692
So you guys go to sleep.

2135
01:12:19,692 --> 01:12:23,671
Wake up the next morning
fully healed, spells restored,

2136
01:12:23,671 --> 01:12:25,681
well rested and ready for the day.

2137
01:12:25,681 --> 01:12:26,754
You think it's day.

2138
01:12:26,754 --> 01:12:27,787
It's hard to tell.

2139
01:12:27,787 --> 01:12:29,677
Still, this underground
circumstance is really

2140
01:12:29,677 --> 01:12:30,909
messing with you guys.

2141
01:12:30,909 --> 01:12:32,614
SAM: Well, should we go plunder some mines

2142
01:12:32,614 --> 01:12:33,498
and kill some goblins?

2143
01:12:33,498 --> 01:12:34,625
LAURA: Let's do it.

2144
01:12:34,625 --> 01:12:36,660
TALIESIN: Let's go plunder some mines.

2145
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:38,590
TRAVIS: So we head down to the mines.

2146
01:12:38,952 --> 01:12:39,785
MATT: All right.

2147
01:12:39,785 --> 01:12:40,952
TRAVIS: To the hole.

2148
01:12:40,952 --> 01:12:41,785
MATT: All right.

2149
01:12:41,785 --> 01:12:43,390
TRAVIS: ♫ Takin' it to the hole ♫

2150
01:12:43,390 --> 01:12:44,973
MATT: You make your way

2151
01:12:44,973 --> 01:12:47,506
down to the bottom ring of Kraghammer.

2152
01:12:47,506 --> 01:12:48,649
To the mines proper.

2153
01:12:48,649 --> 01:12:50,495
The miners have gone back to work,

2154
01:12:50,495 --> 01:12:52,556
and from what you can see,

2155
01:12:52,556 --> 01:12:54,705
there's just an all around crazy business

2156
01:12:54,705 --> 01:12:56,919
with people cleaning out, still trying

2157
01:12:56,919 --> 01:12:59,495
to clean out the ichor
that's on the ground

2158
01:12:59,495 --> 01:13:01,925
left over from the battle
you guys had the day before.

2159
01:13:01,925 --> 01:13:03,742
You make your way 
to the front of the mines,

2160
01:13:03,742 --> 01:13:06,327
and immediately three of the
carvers that are standing

2161
01:13:06,327 --> 01:13:08,600
at the front approach
as you begin to walk,

2162
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:11,297
and then upon noticing you, kind of like,

2163
01:13:11,297 --> 01:13:13,471
step back and put their
weapons to the side.

2164
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:14,304
TRAVIS: Yep.

2165
01:13:14,304 --> 01:13:16,255
MATT: Acknowledging the orders they received

2166
01:13:16,255 --> 01:13:17,511
from Lord Greyspine.

2167
01:13:17,511 --> 01:13:19,392
LAURA: Oh, Trinket's with us.

2168
01:13:19,392 --> 01:13:20,524
MATT: Trinket has come along with you.

2169
01:13:20,524 --> 01:13:22,019
SAM: Trinket the bear, Trinket the bear.

2170
01:13:22,019 --> 01:13:24,169
LAURA: I just saw that, don't forget Trinket.

2171
01:13:24,169 --> 01:13:25,422
I didn't forget Trinket.

2172
01:13:25,422 --> 01:13:27,617
MATT: I assume Trinket comes with
you unless you say otherwise.

2173
01:13:27,617 --> 01:13:28,560
MATT: In general.

2174
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:32,510
TRAVIS: Are they especially bowing
to Scanlan the snake slayer?

2175
01:13:32,510 --> 01:13:33,510
MATT: (laughs)

2176
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:35,351
No.

2177
01:13:35,351 --> 01:13:37,128
(group laughs)

2178
01:13:37,128 --> 01:13:37,961
TRAVIS: No love!

2179
01:13:37,961 --> 01:13:39,477
MATT: They're busy working.

2180
01:13:40,938 --> 01:13:43,955
MATT: And fair play to the
gnome, but they're dwarves.

2181
01:13:43,955 --> 01:13:44,788
SAM: Sure.

2182
01:13:44,788 --> 01:13:45,682
ORION: Yeah.

2183
01:13:45,682 --> 01:13:47,389
They see that crap all the time.

2184
01:13:47,389 --> 01:13:50,913
MATT: You make your way into the mine proper.

2185
01:13:50,913 --> 01:13:53,128
It goes back for a good
10 minutes of walking

2186
01:13:53,128 --> 01:13:53,961
and of winding.

2187
01:13:53,961 --> 01:13:55,434
You can see the actual track

2188
01:13:55,434 --> 01:13:57,705
of the minetrack leading around.

2189
01:13:57,705 --> 01:13:59,583
You come upon a couple
of dwarves that

2190
01:13:59,583 --> 01:14:00,966
look over their shoulders
begrudgingly at you guys

2191
01:14:00,966 --> 01:14:02,606
as you pass going, "Hey?

2192
01:14:02,606 --> 01:14:05,337
Eh, shh," and go right back into
mining whatever remains

2193
01:14:05,337 --> 01:14:06,583
in the inside of this.

2194
01:14:06,583 --> 01:14:07,974
It looks like this portion of the mine

2195
01:14:07,974 --> 01:14:09,704
has been nearly picked clean.

2196
01:14:09,704 --> 01:14:11,812
The dwarves that are in there
are probably just wasting time

2197
01:14:11,812 --> 01:14:13,901
to get their pay for the day.

2198
01:14:13,901 --> 01:14:16,074
You go further back and
eventually it opens up.

2199
01:14:16,074 --> 01:14:17,565
I think I have the map available.

2200
01:14:17,565 --> 01:14:18,398
LIAM: I've got it right here.

2201
01:14:18,398 --> 01:14:19,231
SAM: It's over there.

2202
01:14:19,231 --> 01:14:20,154
MATT: Cool.

2203
01:14:20,157 --> 01:14:22,119
SAM: Can you put it so that the people can see?

2204
01:14:22,119 --> 01:14:23,252
LAURA: Oh, yeah.

2205
01:14:23,252 --> 01:14:24,085
SAM: Is that a thing?

2206
01:14:24,085 --> 01:14:25,234
TRAVIS: They can't see that.

2207
01:14:25,234 --> 01:14:27,710
MATT: We can put it on there perhaps.

2208
01:14:27,710 --> 01:14:29,707
For the most part I'll be
describing it as you go,

2209
01:14:29,707 --> 01:14:30,723
so it's not too important.

2210
01:14:30,723 --> 01:14:31,526
LAURA: Okay.

2211
01:14:31,526 --> 01:14:32,779
TALIESIN: Looks like Italy.

2212
01:14:32,779 --> 01:14:33,612
MATT: Yes.

2213
01:14:33,612 --> 01:14:34,585
TRAVIS: It's a boot.

2214
01:14:34,585 --> 01:14:36,044
MARISHA: It's the boot, yeah.

2215
01:14:36,044 --> 01:14:38,410
MATT: Following it, you get
to a portion of the mine

2216
01:14:38,410 --> 01:14:39,316
that is very busy.

2217
01:14:39,316 --> 01:14:41,406
You can see, since this is
probably one of the portions

2218
01:14:41,406 --> 01:14:44,220
that wasn't collapsed
in previous incursions

2219
01:14:44,220 --> 01:14:46,693
buy whatever creatures these were,

2220
01:14:46,693 --> 01:14:48,583
you get the feeling that
this one has basically taken

2221
01:14:48,583 --> 01:14:51,291
most of their workforce to try and find

2222
01:14:51,291 --> 01:14:53,041
and carve a new vein.

2223
01:14:53,876 --> 01:14:55,809
Or find a new path to pull things from.

2224
01:14:55,809 --> 01:14:58,891
You get towards the portion

2225
01:14:58,891 --> 01:15:00,745
where all these dwarves are working,

2226
01:15:00,745 --> 01:15:03,390
and you notice that some of
the doors have been shattered,

2227
01:15:03,390 --> 01:15:04,563
knocked off the hinges.

2228
01:15:04,563 --> 01:15:06,140
You imagine whatever creatures

2229
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:08,014
were barreling through before,

2230
01:15:08,014 --> 01:15:10,297
this is probably where they came through.

2231
01:15:10,297 --> 01:15:11,858
LAURA: All right.

2232
01:15:11,858 --> 01:15:13,686
TALIESIN: That's where we're going.

2233
01:15:13,686 --> 01:15:15,568
TRAVIS: Make an arcane check.
Somebody with arcane.

2234
01:15:15,568 --> 01:15:17,447
LAURA: Oh yeah, can I look around?

2235
01:15:17,447 --> 01:15:18,280
Perception.

2236
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:19,503
MATT: You look around.

2237
01:15:19,503 --> 01:15:20,690
What are you looking for?

2238
01:15:20,690 --> 01:15:22,286
LAURA: I'm looking for, you know.

2239
01:15:22,286 --> 01:15:23,119
(group laughs)

2240
01:15:23,119 --> 01:15:24,232
TRAVIS: Be specific.

2241
01:15:24,232 --> 01:15:25,502
TALIESIN: 15 arcana check.

2242
01:15:25,502 --> 01:15:26,946
LAURA: Scratch marks for anything.

2243
01:15:26,946 --> 01:15:28,870
MARISHA: I like the idea of magic perception.

2244
01:15:28,870 --> 01:15:31,773
TALIESIN: I just wanna see if
there's anything familiar

2245
01:15:31,773 --> 01:15:35,690
about the markings,
if I can identify

2246
01:15:36,009 --> 01:15:38,812
any signs of something mystical
that's come through here.

2247
01:15:38,812 --> 01:15:41,050
TRAVIS: Like a portal or a prison or a--

2248
01:15:41,050 --> 01:15:42,903
MATT: That'd be more of an investigation roll.

2249
01:15:42,903 --> 01:15:44,047
TALIESIN: Oh, well, alright.

2250
01:15:44,047 --> 01:15:45,916
LAURA: I'm gonna look for tracks.

2251
01:15:45,916 --> 01:15:46,719
MATT: Okay.

2252
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:49,002
That'll be an investigation
roll for you as well.

2253
01:15:49,002 --> 01:15:51,189
MARISHA: I'm gonna assist her,
look for animal tracks.

2254
01:15:51,189 --> 01:15:52,335
LAURA: I'm scared, I don't
know which one to roll.

2255
01:15:52,335 --> 01:15:53,625
Both my die have been rolling so bad.

2256
01:15:53,625 --> 01:15:55,623
ORION: I want to detect magic for a while.

2257
01:15:55,623 --> 01:15:56,897
MATT: All right.

2258
01:15:56,897 --> 01:15:59,181
(loud thud)

2259
01:15:59,181 --> 01:16:00,574
MATT: Aid roll, Keyleth?

2260
01:16:00,574 --> 01:16:02,682
LAURA: This one is no longer in service.

2261
01:16:03,098 --> 01:16:04,161
TALIESIN: Oh, wow!

2262
01:16:04,161 --> 01:16:05,252
MARISHA: Five.

2263
01:16:05,252 --> 01:16:06,832
TRAVIS: Well hers is a lot better.

2264
01:16:06,832 --> 01:16:07,719
MARISHA: Good.

2265
01:16:07,719 --> 01:16:10,293
LIAM: Sorry, I've got the map,
so I'm looking at the mine.

2266
01:16:10,293 --> 01:16:12,229
Are we still in the dwarven carved out,

2267
01:16:12,229 --> 01:16:14,799
sort of structure portion of the mine.

2268
01:16:14,799 --> 01:16:15,632
MATT: You are.

2269
01:16:15,632 --> 01:16:18,059
You have just essentially
started on that map.

2270
01:16:19,252 --> 01:16:20,395
SAM: So let's go down.

2271
01:16:20,395 --> 01:16:21,812
LIAM: Guys, I'm holding a map.

2272
01:16:21,812 --> 01:16:25,315
I see one room that
they've scrawled "Supply" on,

2273
01:16:25,315 --> 01:16:27,515
so it should be the next right up ahead.

2274
01:16:27,515 --> 01:16:29,540
I'd like to just take a peek in there

2275
01:16:29,540 --> 01:16:32,513
and see what we can see
before we head deeper in.

2276
01:16:32,513 --> 01:16:34,419
MATT: All right, you are--?

2277
01:16:34,419 --> 01:16:36,302
LAURA: I rolled a one again.

2278
01:16:36,302 --> 01:16:37,360
MATT: A natural one.

2279
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:39,021
LAURA: A natural one.

2280
01:16:39,021 --> 01:16:42,525
Vax and I get dressed up
in Sherlock Holmes cosplay,

2281
01:16:42,525 --> 01:16:45,323
and we say, "Golly gee, I
think I see some animal tracks

2282
01:16:45,323 --> 01:16:46,706
"over here."

2283
01:16:46,706 --> 01:16:48,353
TALIESIN: They are staring at their
own footprints on the ground.

2284
01:16:48,353 --> 01:16:50,073
MARISHA: "The trail's going cold!"

2285
01:16:50,073 --> 01:16:51,800
TALIESIN: Following around in a circle.

2286
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:53,661
MATT: Oh man, this has turned completely back

2287
01:16:53,661 --> 01:16:55,105
from the first game.

2288
01:16:55,105 --> 01:16:56,893
You guys are failing consistently.

2289
01:16:56,893 --> 01:16:57,726
LAURA: Everything.

2290
01:16:57,726 --> 01:17:00,009
MATT: Let's turn this around,
let's turn this around.

2291
01:17:00,009 --> 01:17:02,296
LIAM: Anyhow, I've got a map, so let's use this.

2292
01:17:02,296 --> 01:17:03,269
Stay on point here.

2293
01:17:03,269 --> 01:17:06,017
MATT: You make your way 
towards the supply room as you

2294
01:17:06,017 --> 01:17:07,217
head to where it was.

2295
01:17:07,217 --> 01:17:08,561
One of the dwarves is guarding it.

2296
01:17:08,561 --> 01:17:11,077
Not a carver, just one of
the miners that was hired

2297
01:17:11,077 --> 01:17:12,962
for this purpose is standing there.

2298
01:17:12,962 --> 01:17:15,364
Leads you into the door,
kind of opening it for you,

2299
01:17:15,364 --> 01:17:18,934
awkwardly going, "All right,
whatever you're looking for, fine.

2300
01:17:18,934 --> 01:17:20,403
"Go inside."

2301
01:17:20,403 --> 01:17:23,168
Looking inside, there are
just racks and racks and racks

2302
01:17:23,168 --> 01:17:26,729
of pickaxes, shovels, utensils
for the purpose of mining

2303
01:17:26,729 --> 01:17:27,699
and constructing.

2304
01:17:27,699 --> 01:17:29,578
There are wooden boards lying down.

2305
01:17:29,578 --> 01:17:33,077
There are just giant barrels
of nails and clipping utensils,

2306
01:17:33,077 --> 01:17:35,665
and things that are used
in the continuous expansion

2307
01:17:35,665 --> 01:17:36,533
of a mine.

2308
01:17:36,533 --> 01:17:37,789
LIAM: I've seen enough.

2309
01:17:37,789 --> 01:17:38,952
We should keep going.

2310
01:17:38,952 --> 01:17:41,057
(group laughs)

2311
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:43,584
This map says that there's an elevator

2312
01:17:43,584 --> 01:17:45,471
a short ways up.
LAURA: That goes down.

2313
01:17:45,471 --> 01:17:46,304
LIAM: That goes down.

2314
01:17:46,304 --> 01:17:48,968
But then there's a railway
that goes further in

2315
01:17:48,968 --> 01:17:51,147
into the caves, so I'm not sure.

2316
01:17:51,147 --> 01:17:53,230
LAURA: We should probably go down.

2317
01:17:53,236 --> 01:17:55,320
MARISHA: Yeah, I feel like going down.
LIAM: Elevator straight down?

2318
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:57,905
MARISHA: Let's go further, all the way down.

2319
01:17:57,905 --> 01:17:59,956
SAM: How many of us can the elevator hold?

2320
01:17:59,956 --> 01:18:02,441
MATT: Elevator can pretty much
hold all of you guys.

2321
01:18:02,441 --> 01:18:03,617
SAM: Okay, let's go.

2322
01:18:03,617 --> 01:18:05,125
LIAM: It's a safe assumption
that Lady Kima did not just

2323
01:18:05,125 --> 01:18:06,912
walk to the back of the upper floors,

2324
01:18:06,912 --> 01:18:07,777
she probably went down.

2325
01:18:07,777 --> 01:18:08,610
SAM: Yeah, let's go down, come on!

2326
01:18:08,610 --> 01:18:10,314
LIAM: Get shit done, let's go.

2327
01:18:10,314 --> 01:18:11,147
MATT: All right.

2328
01:18:11,147 --> 01:18:12,170
LAURA: Let's do it.

2329
01:18:12,170 --> 01:18:13,003
MARISHA: Get low.

2330
01:18:13,003 --> 01:18:14,219
TRAVIS: Air high five.

2331
01:18:14,219 --> 01:18:15,952
LIAM: We have a map to the elevator.

2332
01:18:15,952 --> 01:18:16,785
TRAVIS: Make 10.

2333
01:18:16,785 --> 01:18:19,692
MATT: As you guys are walking over
to where the elevator is,

2334
01:18:19,692 --> 01:18:21,982
you do notice there are
two places in the mines

2335
01:18:21,982 --> 01:18:24,102
where there is just large piles of rubble.

2336
01:18:24,102 --> 01:18:26,119
And part of the ceiling has collapsed.

2337
01:18:26,119 --> 01:18:28,190
You can see that there were portions

2338
01:18:28,190 --> 01:18:31,409
where the mine expanded much
deeper into the mountain

2339
01:18:31,409 --> 01:18:34,544
that were detonated or
collapsed in the idea

2340
01:18:34,544 --> 01:18:37,546
of preventing any further incursion by

2341
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:41,296
whatever these creatures
are pouring through.

2342
01:18:42,693 --> 01:18:45,349
You also can see that there
are some dwarven corpses

2343
01:18:45,349 --> 01:18:47,437
being loaded out from the mine below,

2344
01:18:47,437 --> 01:18:49,406
as well as goblin corpses,

2345
01:18:49,406 --> 01:18:51,766
individuals that were caught in the attack

2346
01:18:51,766 --> 01:18:53,966
that happened yesterday before it managed

2347
01:18:53,966 --> 01:18:55,965
to emerge from the mine.

2348
01:18:55,965 --> 01:18:58,789
LIAM: Scanlan, are you all right
around these goblin corpses?

2349
01:18:58,789 --> 01:19:00,420
LAURA: We should follow those.

2350
01:19:01,406 --> 01:19:05,451
SAM: Any goblin corpse is a good goblin, I say.

2351
01:19:05,451 --> 01:19:06,422
I'm fine with it.

2352
01:19:06,422 --> 01:19:08,246
I'll just quickly spit on their bodies

2353
01:19:08,246 --> 01:19:09,281
as they go by.

2354
01:19:09,281 --> 01:19:11,861
MATT: And you do so quite quickly (spits).

2355
01:19:11,861 --> 01:19:13,334
It's rapid, it's amazing.

2356
01:19:13,334 --> 01:19:14,901
LAURA: So we follow the corpses

2357
01:19:14,901 --> 01:19:16,775
and see where they're coming from.

2358
01:19:16,775 --> 01:19:20,099
MATT: All right. So that heads away 
from the elevator.

2359
01:19:20,099 --> 01:19:21,740
SAM: No no no, no no no.

2360
01:19:21,740 --> 01:19:23,851
That's being taken to be
buried, let's just keep--

2361
01:19:23,851 --> 01:19:25,954
LAURA: No no no, where 
they're coming from.

2362
01:19:25,954 --> 01:19:26,784
SAM: Oh.

2363
01:19:26,784 --> 01:19:29,685
LIAM: So we could either go
to the rear of the mine

2364
01:19:29,685 --> 01:19:32,048
on this level and see
where they're coming from.

2365
01:19:32,048 --> 01:19:34,095
LAURA: I thought we already went downstairs?

2366
01:19:34,095 --> 01:19:35,293
LIAM: No, not yet.

2367
01:19:35,293 --> 01:19:37,732
MATT: There's a spiral staircase on the map.

2368
01:19:37,732 --> 01:19:39,420
On the lower right hand side.

2369
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:40,586
LIAM: Yes, I see it.

2370
01:19:40,586 --> 01:19:41,919
MATT: That's where they're coming from.

2371
01:19:41,919 --> 01:19:42,752
LAURA: Does that lead down probably?

2372
01:19:42,752 --> 01:19:43,822
MATT: It seems to.

2373
01:19:43,822 --> 01:19:46,257
LAURA: Well then let's take
the elevator, whatever.

2374
01:19:46,257 --> 01:19:47,430
Let's go down.

2375
01:19:47,430 --> 01:19:48,605
MATT: All right.

2376
01:19:48,605 --> 01:19:50,512
TRAVIS: You should put it under the thing.

2377
01:19:50,512 --> 01:19:52,419
TALIESIN: We're good with down.

2378
01:19:52,419 --> 01:19:54,786
MATT: You guys go ahead and
approach the elevator.

2379
01:19:54,786 --> 01:19:58,097
It's a large wooden platform
with a series of chains.

2380
01:19:58,097 --> 01:20:01,188
My terrible, hastily
drawn map there for you.

2381
01:20:01,188 --> 01:20:02,988
TRAVIS: It's kinda crap, but it's kinda great.

2382
01:20:02,988 --> 01:20:03,911
MATT: Yeah, I know.

2383
01:20:03,911 --> 01:20:06,075
It was actually more
designed as a DM utensil,

2384
01:20:06,075 --> 01:20:07,881
but you guys needed a map--

2385
01:20:07,881 --> 01:20:08,714
TRAVIS: I love it.

2386
01:20:08,714 --> 01:20:09,547
MATT: --so I gave you my map.

2387
01:20:09,547 --> 01:20:11,751
TRAVIS: There you go.

2388
01:20:11,751 --> 01:20:12,584
LAURA: Take it back.

2389
01:20:12,584 --> 01:20:13,805
MATT: So I'm taking it back.

2390
01:20:13,805 --> 01:20:14,763
(group laughs)

2391
01:20:14,763 --> 01:20:15,596
ORION: Give it to me.

2392
01:20:15,596 --> 01:20:16,469
MATT: It's-a mine.

2393
01:20:16,469 --> 01:20:18,664
No, I'm keeping it.

2394
01:20:18,664 --> 01:20:20,199
It's all right.

2395
01:20:20,199 --> 01:20:22,310
So you get back to the elevator.

2396
01:20:22,310 --> 01:20:27,227
There's a large 15 by 20
platform with a series of chains

2397
01:20:27,227 --> 01:20:30,587
and there are two dwarves in the back

2398
01:20:30,587 --> 01:20:33,249
that run a giant iron wheel.

2399
01:20:33,249 --> 01:20:35,675
As you approach, they kind
of give you a look, like,

2400
01:20:35,675 --> 01:20:37,901
"Well, are you serious about going down?"

2401
01:20:37,901 --> 01:20:40,015
[Travis, Laura, and Marisha] Yeah.

2402
01:20:40,015 --> 01:20:42,193
MATT: "Okay, step on the platform."

2403
01:20:42,193 --> 01:20:43,356
LAURA: Let's do it.

2404
01:20:43,356 --> 01:20:45,918
The two dwarves grab and begin
to rotate the giant wheel,

2405
01:20:45,918 --> 01:20:48,725
as it does you here the winch
and the chain begin to tighten

2406
01:20:48,725 --> 01:20:49,558
as it does.

2407
01:20:49,558 --> 01:20:51,017
The platform shudders for a second,

2408
01:20:51,017 --> 01:20:52,215
begins to lower.

2409
01:20:52,215 --> 01:20:54,111
As it begins to lower, you
can feel the actual platform

2410
01:20:54,111 --> 01:20:56,245
shake a little bit
as the whole weight

2411
01:20:56,245 --> 01:20:57,078
is placed on the chains.

2412
01:20:57,078 --> 01:20:58,413
TALIESIN: Guys. We're on an elevator.

2413
01:20:58,413 --> 01:20:59,970
MARISHA: This is scary.

2414
01:20:59,970 --> 01:21:01,278
ORION: I love elevators.

2415
01:21:01,278 --> 01:21:02,610
MATT: As the winch begins to release, it--

2416
01:21:02,610 --> 01:21:04,019
LAURA: I pet Trinket, calm him down.

2417
01:21:04,019 --> 01:21:04,935
MARISHA: I've never been on 
one of these before.

2418
01:21:04,935 --> 01:21:06,317
MATT: Trinket is a little nervous.

2419
01:21:06,317 --> 01:21:07,420
MARISHA: It's really tight.

2420
01:21:07,420 --> 01:21:09,523
TALIESIN: I'm on an elevator with a bear.

2421
01:21:09,523 --> 01:21:11,310
MARISHA: It's really dark, tight.

2422
01:21:11,310 --> 01:21:12,585
ORION: Oh, light! (snaps)

2423
01:21:12,585 --> 01:21:13,933
TALIESIN: Thank you.

2424
01:21:13,933 --> 01:21:15,099
LAURA: Are we down yet?

2425
01:21:15,099 --> 01:21:16,852
MARISHA: Keyleth's getting a little claustrophobic.

2426
01:21:16,852 --> 01:21:18,797
She's never been in this tight of a space.

2427
01:21:18,797 --> 01:21:20,460
TRAVIS: Are you claustrophobic?

2428
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:24,616
MATT: As the light spell bursts
out from his staff.

2429
01:21:24,616 --> 01:21:28,855
You all kind of have to
cover your eyes for a second.

2430
01:21:28,855 --> 01:21:30,841
But the lower area is opened up.

2431
01:21:30,841 --> 01:21:32,356
LIAM: Word of warning, Tiberius.

2432
01:21:32,356 --> 01:21:33,369
LAURA: Can we see out?

2433
01:21:33,369 --> 01:21:35,745
ORION: She said it was dark,
and then I cast my spell.

2434
01:21:35,745 --> 01:21:37,085
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's what you do.

2435
01:21:37,085 --> 01:21:39,968
MATT: (imitates loud thudding) You
guys hit the bottom floor.

2436
01:21:39,968 --> 01:21:41,433
You step off the platform, and you can see

2437
01:21:41,433 --> 01:21:44,148
there is a secondary minecart
that leads from this elevator

2438
01:21:44,148 --> 01:21:46,508
that curves to the left and leads deeper

2439
01:21:46,508 --> 01:21:48,488
into the mine proper.

2440
01:21:48,488 --> 01:21:50,754
To the right of you is
the spiral staircase.

2441
01:21:50,754 --> 01:21:53,587
And you can see now two
of the other miner dwarves

2442
01:21:53,587 --> 01:21:56,046
are dragging a dead body across.

2443
01:21:56,046 --> 01:21:59,465
LAURA: Can I look for goblin tracks
down here and follow those?

2444
01:21:59,465 --> 01:22:00,597
MATT: (laughs) You can attempt
another investigation check.

2445
01:22:00,597 --> 01:22:02,774
SAM: Why don't we just ask the dwarves

2446
01:22:02,774 --> 01:22:06,029
where they were getting the bodies?

2447
01:22:06,029 --> 01:22:07,778
TRAVIS: You're gonna roll crap.
You're gonna roll crap.

2448
01:22:07,778 --> 01:22:08,983
LAURA: Don't curse me.

2449
01:22:08,983 --> 01:22:11,602
MARISHA: Please don't do that.

2450
01:22:11,602 --> 01:22:13,890
LAURA: What am I, what is it?
That I add it to?

2451
01:22:13,890 --> 01:22:14,799
MATT: Investigate.

2452
01:22:14,799 --> 01:22:15,732
LAURA: Perception?

2453
01:22:15,732 --> 01:22:16,825
MATT: Investigate.

2454
01:22:16,825 --> 01:22:18,738
But you advantage on the roll,
because you're a ranger, tracking.

2455
01:22:18,738 --> 01:22:19,819
LAURA: Oh sweet.
Okay.

2456
01:22:19,822 --> 01:22:21,303
SAM: Why don't we just ask?

2457
01:22:21,303 --> 01:22:22,481
LAURA: Well that's good, okay.

2458
01:22:22,481 --> 01:22:24,263
Let's go with a 17.

2459
01:22:24,263 --> 01:22:25,430
MATT: 17, alright.

2460
01:22:27,248 --> 01:22:29,994
So as you guys are going
to ask somebody about this,

2461
01:22:29,994 --> 01:22:32,565
your ranger gets down and
begins inspecting the floor.

2462
01:22:32,565 --> 01:22:34,073
LAURA: Yeah, I see things!

2463
01:22:34,073 --> 01:22:35,910
MATT: Where you can see there were struggles

2464
01:22:35,910 --> 01:22:37,093
that apparently occurred.

2465
01:22:37,093 --> 01:22:38,920
You can see slash marks on the ground.

2466
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:41,004
You can see bodies, or
the impacts of bodies

2467
01:22:41,004 --> 01:22:44,639
where some of these dwarves
have been pulled away.

2468
01:22:44,639 --> 01:22:47,489
A few minutes later, you can see tracks,

2469
01:22:47,489 --> 01:22:51,552
dwarven tracks, of bodies
being pulled and dragged,

2470
01:22:51,552 --> 01:22:54,237
not in the direction they're going,

2471
01:22:54,237 --> 01:22:56,496
but further down the tunnel.

2472
01:22:56,496 --> 01:22:58,292
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's go there.

2473
01:22:58,292 --> 01:22:59,790
LAURA: Oh, no.

2474
01:22:59,790 --> 01:23:01,776
MATT: As you look and follow that track,

2475
01:23:01,776 --> 01:23:03,670
you notice that maybe a good 200 feet

2476
01:23:03,670 --> 01:23:06,486
to the left of the cavern,
there is a new tunnel breach

2477
01:23:06,486 --> 01:23:07,654
that is currently open.

2478
01:23:07,654 --> 01:23:10,801
About a 20 by 15 size tunnel
that is fresh and blasted out

2479
01:23:10,801 --> 01:23:11,838
from the other side.

2480
01:23:11,838 --> 01:23:14,415
You can see rubble and rocks
strewn across the floor.

2481
01:23:14,415 --> 01:23:16,358
LAURA: I hear, I hear birds coming from the--

2482
01:23:16,358 --> 01:23:17,671
TRAVIS: It's a fucking trip, right?

2483
01:23:17,671 --> 01:23:18,572
LAURA: I know.

2484
01:23:18,572 --> 01:23:19,865
SAM: Let's go down there.

2485
01:23:19,865 --> 01:23:21,565
Let's go down where it's dangerous.

2486
01:23:21,565 --> 01:23:22,398
MATT: All right.

2487
01:23:22,398 --> 01:23:23,401
LAURA: Can we see?

2488
01:23:23,401 --> 01:23:24,580
TRAVIS: Can we ask one of the guards?

2489
01:23:24,580 --> 01:23:25,803
TALIESIN: It's a mine canary.

2490
01:23:25,803 --> 01:23:27,176
LIAM: Is it black or is it dim?

2491
01:23:27,176 --> 01:23:28,868
MATT: With his light spell, it's fairly bright.

2492
01:23:28,868 --> 01:23:29,901
TRAVIS: Nice!

2493
01:23:29,901 --> 01:23:31,512
MATT: Otherwise, it's fairly dim.

2494
01:23:31,512 --> 01:23:35,033
TRAVIS: I cup my hands over my face
and go, Grog, Grog, Grog. (laughs)

2495
01:23:37,291 --> 01:23:38,630
MATT: And it does echo.

2496
01:23:38,630 --> 01:23:40,883
Grog, Grog, Grog, Grog.

2497
01:23:40,883 --> 01:23:42,346
LAURA: Why would you do that?

2498
01:23:42,346 --> 01:23:43,170
TRAVIS: Why not?

2499
01:23:43,170 --> 01:23:44,003
MATT: (faintly) Grog-Grog. Grog.

2500
01:23:45,866 --> 01:23:49,027
Following the tracks,
you can see the dragging

2501
01:23:49,027 --> 01:23:52,689
of the bodies does indeed
go in the direction,

2502
01:23:52,689 --> 01:23:55,171
and into the newly carved tunnel.

2503
01:23:55,171 --> 01:23:56,171
In this mine network.

2504
01:23:56,171 --> 01:23:57,456
LAURA: All right.

2505
01:23:59,199 --> 01:24:01,394
MATT: What you do notice is the dwarves' bodies

2506
01:24:01,394 --> 01:24:03,049
that are being dragged away:

2507
01:24:03,049 --> 01:24:05,187
you can see footprints
of those that are also

2508
01:24:05,187 --> 01:24:06,147
pulling them aside.

2509
01:24:06,147 --> 01:24:08,583
You kind of figure out the
idea of the pattern

2510
01:24:08,583 --> 01:24:09,583
of the footsteps that are
leading in that direction.

2511
01:24:09,583 --> 01:24:11,116
LAURA: Big, small?

2512
01:24:11,116 --> 01:24:13,044
MATT: Most of them are also dwarven in shape.

2513
01:24:13,044 --> 01:24:13,937
LAURA: Oh, okay.

2514
01:24:13,937 --> 01:24:15,150
MARISHA: Most of them.

2515
01:24:15,150 --> 01:24:18,271
MATT: So, there are, you can gather,

2516
01:24:18,271 --> 01:24:20,760
dwarven feet dragging
dwarven bodies deeper inside.

2517
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:21,563
LIAM: Duergar.

2518
01:24:21,563 --> 01:24:22,939
LAURA: Dwarven centipede.

2519
01:24:22,939 --> 01:24:24,035
LIAM: It's the duergar.

2520
01:24:24,035 --> 01:24:27,160
MATT: However, there are two
bodies that are being dragged

2521
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:29,067
with no footprints whatsoever.

2522
01:24:29,067 --> 01:24:29,982
TRAVIS: What?

2523
01:24:29,982 --> 01:24:30,775
LAURA: Wings.

2524
01:24:30,775 --> 01:24:32,626
SAM: They're being used like skateboards.

2525
01:24:32,626 --> 01:24:35,105
(group laughs)

2526
01:24:35,105 --> 01:24:36,621
MARISHA: Legolas style.

2527
01:24:36,621 --> 01:24:38,664
ORION: Who and what are those?

2528
01:24:38,664 --> 01:24:39,914
LIAM: This is 2015.

2529
01:24:42,043 --> 01:24:43,341
TRAVIS: Is there any residue?

2530
01:24:43,341 --> 01:24:44,174
MARISHA: Yeah.

2531
01:24:44,174 --> 01:24:46,060
SAM: Wow, if only we had asked some dwarves

2532
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:47,843
what's been going on down here.

2533
01:24:47,843 --> 01:24:49,870
LAURA: Is there any residue, blood?

2534
01:24:49,870 --> 01:24:51,124
ORION: We already know.

2535
01:24:51,124 --> 01:24:52,577
LAURA: Green, red, black.

2536
01:24:52,577 --> 01:24:56,327
MATT: From the dragging marks,
there is no blood.

2537
01:24:57,595 --> 01:25:00,696
There's no signs of them dragging
dead bodies off, at least.

2538
01:25:00,696 --> 01:25:02,766
LAURA: Does it look like they struggled?

2539
01:25:02,766 --> 01:25:04,676
MATT: No, there's no struggle either.

2540
01:25:04,676 --> 01:25:05,882
TRAVIS: Oh crap, fire.

2541
01:25:05,882 --> 01:25:06,992
MARISHA: What about the walls?

2542
01:25:06,992 --> 01:25:08,521
How close are the walls?

2543
01:25:08,521 --> 01:25:10,600
MATT: The walls here for this tunnel are

2544
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:12,190
about 15, 20 feet in width.

2545
01:25:14,063 --> 01:25:15,798
And about 10, 15 feet high.

2546
01:25:15,798 --> 01:25:18,774
MARISHA: Are there any scratch
marks or anything like that

2547
01:25:18,774 --> 01:25:20,178
on the walls?

2548
01:25:20,178 --> 01:25:21,658
MATT: No.

2549
01:25:21,658 --> 01:25:23,800
LIAM: Let's stop dicking around
and go into that mine.

2550
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:26,076
TRAVIS, TALIESIN: Yeah.
LAURA: Might as well.

2551
01:25:26,482 --> 01:25:27,510
MATT: All right.

2552
01:25:27,510 --> 01:25:28,570
TRAVIS: We go further.

2553
01:25:28,570 --> 01:25:30,020
MATT: You push further in.

2554
01:25:30,020 --> 01:25:31,922
(Liam imitates sword being drawn)

2555
01:25:31,922 --> 01:25:34,840
MATT: So, this tunnel, pitch black.

2556
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:36,100
There's no light source aside from the one

2557
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:37,331
that you're creating.

2558
01:25:37,331 --> 01:25:39,580
You guys push forward.

2559
01:25:39,580 --> 01:25:41,539
And push forward, following the tracks.

2560
01:25:41,539 --> 01:25:43,074
And push forward.

2561
01:25:43,074 --> 01:25:47,277
And the the tunnel winds
and winds and descends.

2562
01:25:47,277 --> 01:25:49,194
And winds and descends.

2563
01:25:50,462 --> 01:25:52,351
About two hours--

2564
01:25:52,351 --> 01:25:54,214
[Laura, Marisha, Travis, and Sam] What?!

2565
01:25:54,214 --> 01:25:56,749
MATT: --of following this tunnel
with little variation.

2566
01:25:56,749 --> 01:25:58,322
LAURA: Should've grabbed some dried fruit.

2567
01:25:58,322 --> 01:25:59,155
TRAVIS: We got a ton.

2568
01:25:59,155 --> 01:26:03,082
MATT: Steadily declining and
winding as it progresses.

2569
01:26:03,082 --> 01:26:04,760
Three hours go by.

2570
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:06,728
This tunnel goes extremely deep.

2571
01:26:06,728 --> 01:26:08,916
Whatever managed to dig its way up here

2572
01:26:08,916 --> 01:26:11,583
came from pretty far under this mine.

2573
01:26:11,583 --> 01:26:14,685
LAURA: At no point does it look
like the bodies ever moved?

2574
01:26:14,685 --> 01:26:16,713
MATT: Nope, no change in physicality.

2575
01:26:16,713 --> 01:26:18,175
No sign of struggle.

2576
01:26:18,175 --> 01:26:20,542
MARISHA: But there are the drag marks all the way?
MATT: Yeah.

2577
01:26:20,542 --> 01:26:22,465
LIAM: And two hours ago, 
I started stealthing

2578
01:26:22,465 --> 01:26:23,799
and taking the lead.

2579
01:26:23,799 --> 01:26:24,984
When we're in the dark.

2580
01:26:24,984 --> 01:26:27,394
MATT: All right, go ahead
and roll a stealth check.

2581
01:26:27,394 --> 01:26:29,174
LAURA: I thought I was tracking.

2582
01:26:33,081 --> 01:26:33,914
LIAM: Uh, 29.

2583
01:26:33,914 --> 01:26:35,626
LAURA: Whoo, that's a good roll.

2584
01:26:35,626 --> 01:26:37,360
Yay, first good roll of the night.

2585
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:38,501
MATT: All right, there we go.

2586
01:26:38,501 --> 01:26:39,894
Your luck is changing now.

2587
01:26:39,894 --> 01:26:41,237
LAURA: Changing it around.

2588
01:26:41,237 --> 01:26:42,620
TRAVIS: Let me touch you.

2589
01:26:42,620 --> 01:26:43,906
MATT: You feel pretty stealthy.

2590
01:26:43,906 --> 01:26:47,817
You guys look like, wait,
where the hell did Vax go?

2591
01:26:47,817 --> 01:26:50,780
MARISHA: Oh shit, I hope he didn't hear
me just say that about him.

2592
01:26:50,780 --> 01:26:51,710
Dammit.

2593
01:26:51,710 --> 01:26:53,162
LAURA: Oh thank you, brother.

2594
01:26:53,162 --> 01:26:55,178
TALIESIN: I'm having a serious
Tom Sawyer island vibe.

2595
01:26:55,178 --> 01:26:56,271
LAURA: I found him.

2596
01:26:56,271 --> 01:26:57,067
LIAM: Looks fine.

2597
01:26:57,067 --> 01:26:58,243
MATT: About four hours--

2598
01:26:58,243 --> 01:27:00,004
MARISHA: Are there any drafts?

2599
01:27:00,004 --> 01:27:01,909
Do I feel any wind flows
or anything like that?

2600
01:27:01,909 --> 01:27:02,803
MATT: No.

2601
01:27:02,803 --> 01:27:03,769
It is still.

2602
01:27:03,769 --> 01:27:05,714
It is stagnant air.

2603
01:27:05,714 --> 01:27:06,547
(Laura coughs)

2604
01:27:06,547 --> 01:27:08,464
Even more stagnant now.

2605
01:27:09,554 --> 01:27:13,721
Four hours of traveling
deeper into this tunnel's path

2606
01:27:15,056 --> 01:27:16,472
until--

2607
01:27:16,472 --> 01:27:18,487
LAURA: Anybody else have to go 
to the bathroom?

2608
01:27:18,487 --> 01:27:20,020
TRAVIS: He rolled, he rolled something.

2609
01:27:20,020 --> 01:27:20,890
LAURA: Oh no, he rolled.

2610
01:27:20,890 --> 01:27:25,097
MARISHA: And so, that is how I
spent my 12th birthday.

2611
01:27:25,097 --> 01:27:26,423
SAM: Great story, Keyleth.

2612
01:27:26,423 --> 01:27:27,256
And, yeah.

2613
01:27:27,256 --> 01:27:28,815
MARISHA: Let's see, what else.

2614
01:27:28,815 --> 01:27:30,930
TRAVIS: Hey Scanlan, you kill me, I kill you.

2615
01:27:30,930 --> 01:27:34,030
LIAM: There a great little cave alcove here,

2616
01:27:34,030 --> 01:27:35,233
perfect for peeing in.

2617
01:27:35,233 --> 01:27:37,083
LAURA: Oh brother, good to see you.

2618
01:27:37,083 --> 01:27:38,678
LIAM: For everyone to pee.

2619
01:27:38,678 --> 01:27:41,511
LAURA: Am I over here, or am I over here?

2620
01:27:42,793 --> 01:27:45,067
Perhaps we could take a pee break here

2621
01:27:45,067 --> 01:27:46,770
and proceed further into the mines.

2622
01:27:46,770 --> 01:27:48,183
MARISHA: I agree with that.

2623
01:27:48,183 --> 01:27:49,631
LAURA: That's a good idea.

2624
01:27:49,631 --> 01:27:51,044
LIAM: Do you catch my drift?

2625
01:27:51,044 --> 01:27:52,771
MATT: As the four hour mark of travel

2626
01:27:52,771 --> 01:27:55,346
into this tunnel presents itself,

2627
01:27:55,346 --> 01:27:58,346
the tunnel finally widens and opens.

2628
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:03,262
As the sound of distant water
rushing reaches your ears.

2629
01:28:03,262 --> 01:28:06,429
LAURA: Oh no, I have to go to the bathroom.

2630
01:28:07,748 --> 01:28:10,915
MATT: As Tiberius steps into this opening,

2631
01:28:11,796 --> 01:28:15,129
the light cascades into this new cavern.

2632
01:28:17,225 --> 01:28:21,862
A large, beautiful open
space presents itself,

2633
01:28:21,862 --> 01:28:24,112
a good 100-foot-up ceiling.

2634
01:28:25,510 --> 01:28:28,176
From what you can see,
a roaring river is now

2635
01:28:28,176 --> 01:28:31,616
pouring out of the nearby rock,
cascading over a cliffside

2636
01:28:31,616 --> 01:28:34,849
into a waterfall down into this deeper,

2637
01:28:34,849 --> 01:28:36,547
giant cavernous space.

2638
01:28:36,547 --> 01:28:38,136
LAURA: What about the tracks?

2639
01:28:38,136 --> 01:28:41,915
MATT: The tracks continue in the
direction of that river.

2640
01:28:41,915 --> 01:28:43,223
MARISHA: Into the river?

2641
01:28:43,223 --> 01:28:46,135
Like it goes into the water?

2642
01:28:46,135 --> 01:28:48,635
LAURA: Do we want to step 
into the room fully?

2643
01:28:48,635 --> 01:28:50,238
MARISHA: Why don't we send--

2644
01:28:50,238 --> 01:28:52,621
LAURA: I'm gonna stealth.
I'm gonna stealth, too.

2645
01:28:52,621 --> 01:28:53,911
MARISHA: Stealth twins.

2646
01:28:53,911 --> 01:28:55,492
ORION: Do I detect any magic?

2647
01:28:55,492 --> 01:28:58,120
Stealth twins, 2015.

2648
01:28:58,120 --> 01:28:59,953
MATT: You detect no magic.

2649
01:28:59,953 --> 01:29:00,893
You roll stealth.

2650
01:29:00,893 --> 01:29:01,691
LAURA: 17.

2651
01:29:01,691 --> 01:29:03,924
MATT: Let's go ahead and take a bio break--

2652
01:29:03,924 --> 01:29:04,757
LAURA: Okay.

2653
01:29:05,695 --> 01:29:07,387
MATT: --as the mystery begins to unveil.

2654
01:29:07,387 --> 01:29:09,613
(group laughs)

2655
01:29:09,613 --> 01:29:10,446
ORION: I love a mystery.

2656
01:29:10,446 --> 01:29:12,748
MATT: Be back here in about
five, ten minutes, folks.

2657
01:29:12,748 --> 01:29:14,094
So keep an ear out.

2658
01:29:14,094 --> 01:29:15,844
TRAVIS: Quick, quick break.

2659
01:29:16,791 --> 01:29:18,364
ORION: I'm gonna pee my face off.

2660
01:29:18,364 --> 01:29:19,939
(Liam imitates rushing water)

2661
01:29:20,689 --> 01:29:22,112
MATT: We'll be right back.

2662
01:29:22,112 --> 01:29:23,228
ORION: Enjoy our butt shots, everybody.

2663
01:29:23,228 --> 01:29:26,221
MATT: And everyone runs off to
take care of their business.

2664
01:29:27,364 --> 01:29:29,029
TRAVIS: Right, listen up.

2665
01:29:29,029 --> 01:29:32,556
If you have ale, then you have
a friend in Grog Strongjaw.

2666
01:29:33,795 --> 01:29:37,409
A goliath of towering height and size,

2667
01:29:37,409 --> 01:29:39,659
this barbarian has an
appetite for the two--

2668
01:29:39,659 --> 01:29:41,264
[audio resets]

2669
01:29:41,264 --> 01:29:43,340
TRAVIS: Right, listen up.

2670
01:29:43,340 --> 01:29:46,355
If you have ale, then you have
a friend in Grog Strongjaw.

2671
01:29:48,537 --> 01:29:51,973
A goliath of towering height and size,

2672
01:29:51,973 --> 01:29:54,960
this barbarian has an appetite for the two

2673
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:58,960
great loves in his life:
combat, women, and ale.

2674
01:30:00,751 --> 01:30:02,008
(record scratches)

2675
01:30:02,008 --> 01:30:03,330
Wait.

2676
01:30:03,330 --> 01:30:07,007
Easily the brains of the
group, Grog is often consulted

2677
01:30:07,007 --> 01:30:11,174
for his vast knowledge of
shapes, colors, and shiny things.

2678
01:30:13,422 --> 01:30:14,932
Also ale.

2679
01:30:14,932 --> 01:30:18,789
In his early years, armed
with his two-handed great axe,

2680
01:30:18,789 --> 01:30:21,703
Grog often enjoyed proving
his might amongst the ranks

2681
01:30:21,703 --> 01:30:24,746
of his family's wandering herd.

2682
01:30:24,746 --> 01:30:27,764
But after coming upon an
unsuspecting, elderly gnome

2683
01:30:27,764 --> 01:30:30,269
in the woods, he objected to the killing

2684
01:30:30,269 --> 01:30:32,352
of such an innocent life.

2685
01:30:33,409 --> 01:30:36,774
A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity

2686
01:30:36,774 --> 01:30:39,921
for this, this terrified little thing.

2687
01:30:39,921 --> 01:30:51,701
[no audio]

2688
01:30:51,701 --> 01:30:53,229
TRAVIS: Right, listen up.

2689
01:30:53,229 --> 01:30:57,396
If you have ale, then you have
a friend in Grog Strongjaw.

2690
01:30:58,783 --> 01:31:02,186
A goliath of towering height and size,

2691
01:31:02,186 --> 01:31:06,271
this barbarian has an appetite
for the two great loves

2692
01:31:06,271 --> 01:31:09,271
in his life: combat, women, and ale.

2693
01:31:11,072 --> 01:31:12,134
(record scratching)

2694
01:31:12,134 --> 01:31:13,042
Wait.

2695
01:31:13,522 --> 01:31:17,453
Easily the brains of the
group, Grog is often consulted

2696
01:31:17,453 --> 01:31:21,620
for his vast knowledge of
shapes, colors, and shiny things.

2697
01:31:23,338 --> 01:31:24,171
Also ale.

2698
01:31:25,293 --> 01:31:29,097
In his early years, armed
with his two-handed great axe,

2699
01:31:29,097 --> 01:31:32,101
Grog often enjoyed proving
his might amongst the ranks

2700
01:31:32,101 --> 01:31:34,514
of his family's wandering herd.

2701
01:31:34,514 --> 01:31:38,010
But after coming upon an
unsuspecting elderly gnome

2702
01:31:38,010 --> 01:31:40,572
in the woods, he objected to the killing

2703
01:31:40,572 --> 01:31:42,655
of such an innocent life.

2704
01:31:43,508 --> 01:31:47,093
A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity

2705
01:31:47,093 --> 01:31:50,260
for this, this terrified little thing.

2706
01:31:51,833 --> 01:31:55,026
His disobedience cost him dearly.

2707
01:31:55,026 --> 01:31:58,270
Beaten bloody and banished
by the herd leader,

2708
01:31:58,270 --> 01:32:02,437
his uncle Kevdak, Grog was
abandoned and left to die.

2709
01:32:03,521 --> 01:32:07,182
Exiled from his herd, it
was then that the relative

2710
01:32:07,182 --> 01:32:11,099
of the very gnome he
fought to save, saved him.

2711
01:32:12,209 --> 01:32:15,179
It was the kindness of a
gnome cleric named Pike

2712
01:32:15,179 --> 01:32:19,647
that healed Grog, bringing
him back from death's edge.

2713
01:32:19,647 --> 01:32:23,375
And they have remained
close friends ever since.

2714
01:32:23,375 --> 01:32:27,085
Most nights, Grog can be found
challenging entire taverns

2715
01:32:27,085 --> 01:32:28,920
to wrestling matches.

2716
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:32,026
Or accompanying Scanlan
to the nearest house

2717
01:32:32,026 --> 01:32:34,526
where you pay for lady favors.

2718
01:32:36,044 --> 01:32:36,877
Also ale.

2719
01:32:38,393 --> 01:32:40,301
MARISHA: A first impression of Keyleth

2720
01:32:40,301 --> 01:32:42,360
would leave you with little information

2721
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:44,324
on the half-elven druid.

2722
01:32:44,324 --> 01:32:46,657
You might even think that
her social awkwardness

2723
01:32:46,657 --> 01:32:50,258
due to her sheltered
upbringing is kind of sweet.

2724
01:32:50,258 --> 01:32:53,589
Of course, it would be
unwise to underestimate her

2725
01:32:53,589 --> 01:32:55,154
based on first impressions.

2726
01:32:55,154 --> 01:32:56,777
(lightning roars)

2727
01:32:56,777 --> 01:32:58,808
Under that unintimidating petite frame

2728
01:32:58,808 --> 01:33:01,587
is a vicious beast
waiting to be unleashed,

2729
01:33:01,587 --> 01:33:04,182
whose natural powers have
made even the fiercest

2730
01:33:04,182 --> 01:33:06,629
of champions pee their pants.

2731
01:33:06,629 --> 01:33:07,462
Literally.

2732
01:33:08,537 --> 01:33:11,014
Born to the air tribe
of the Ashari people,

2733
01:33:11,014 --> 01:33:13,793
Keyleth was raised with
a deep love of nature

2734
01:33:13,793 --> 01:33:15,830
and the elemental magics.

2735
01:33:15,830 --> 01:33:17,496
It is her people's inherent duty

2736
01:33:17,496 --> 01:33:20,258
to protect the delicate
areas in Tal'Dorei,

2737
01:33:20,258 --> 01:33:22,650
where the four elemental
planes begin to bleed

2738
01:33:22,650 --> 01:33:24,644
with this realm.

2739
01:33:24,644 --> 01:33:26,786
Since she was a little
girl, she had quite a knack

2740
01:33:26,786 --> 01:33:29,833
for air manipulation and
beast shaping abilities.

2741
01:33:29,833 --> 01:33:33,151
Well, if you consider
kittens and flying squirrels

2742
01:33:33,151 --> 01:33:35,818
to be little beasts, which I do.

2743
01:33:37,129 --> 01:33:39,287
Anyways, it wasn't long
before the headmaster

2744
01:33:39,287 --> 01:33:41,930
of the tribe, her father, Kohren,

2745
01:33:41,930 --> 01:33:43,926
realized her true prodigious abilities

2746
01:33:43,926 --> 01:33:46,157
and she was inveterated to succeed him

2747
01:33:46,157 --> 01:33:48,769
as the next headmaster.

2748
01:33:48,769 --> 01:33:51,628
Just like that, her jovial
childhood was stripped

2749
01:33:51,628 --> 01:33:54,342
and replaced with endless
spell memorization,

2750
01:33:54,342 --> 01:33:56,053
teachings from ancient traditions,

2751
01:33:56,053 --> 01:33:58,880
and exceedingly high expectations.

2752
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:00,684
Every druid leader-to-be must embark

2753
01:34:00,684 --> 01:34:02,956
on a journey to seek out the sister tribes

2754
01:34:02,956 --> 01:34:05,362
in order to introduce
and establish respect

2755
01:34:05,362 --> 01:34:07,963
amongst the fellow headmasters.

2756
01:34:07,963 --> 01:34:12,092
They call this the
Aramente, or Noble Odyssey.

2757
01:34:12,092 --> 01:34:14,668
When her father felt she was
ready, he set her on the path

2758
01:34:14,668 --> 01:34:16,986
to truly discovering herself.

2759
01:34:16,986 --> 01:34:20,749
Not knowing when, or if,
she will ever return.

2760
01:34:20,749 --> 01:34:23,112
As she hikes down the
mountain towards Stillben,

2761
01:34:23,112 --> 01:34:25,761
she meditated on the task ahead.

2762
01:34:25,761 --> 01:34:28,998
Part of the Aramente is proving
yourself a strong warrior,

2763
01:34:28,998 --> 01:34:33,437
a valiant protector, and a
wise and compassionate leader.

2764
01:34:33,437 --> 01:34:36,538
With this knowledge, one
thought plays in repeat

2765
01:34:36,538 --> 01:34:37,538
in her mind:

2766
01:34:39,380 --> 01:34:40,963
Is she even worthy?

2767
01:34:43,310 --> 01:34:45,915
TALIESIN: Percy was the third
child of seven children,

2768
01:34:45,915 --> 01:34:48,226
born to a noble family
who lived far to the north

2769
01:34:48,226 --> 01:34:50,882
in the ancient castle of Whitestone.

2770
01:34:50,882 --> 01:34:53,415
With so many siblings to
share the burdens of lordship,

2771
01:34:53,415 --> 01:34:56,708
Percy turned his attention
to the sciences, engineering,

2772
01:34:56,708 --> 01:34:58,496
and naturalism.

2773
01:34:58,496 --> 01:35:02,384
One day, a mysterious couple
named Lord and Lady Briarwood

2774
01:35:02,384 --> 01:35:04,046
came to court.

2775
01:35:04,046 --> 01:35:06,378
During a feast held in
their honor, the Briarwoods

2776
01:35:06,378 --> 01:35:09,438
violently took control of the castle,

2777
01:35:09,438 --> 01:35:11,130
killing or imprisoning
everyone who would stand

2778
01:35:11,130 --> 01:35:12,988
in their way.

2779
01:35:12,988 --> 01:35:14,887
Percy awoke chained in the dungeon,

2780
01:35:14,887 --> 01:35:17,636
only to be freed by his younger sister.

2781
01:35:17,636 --> 01:35:20,737
Together they fled, chased
by the Briarwoods' men.

2782
01:35:20,737 --> 01:35:23,965
As they ran, Percy's
sister took several arrows

2783
01:35:23,965 --> 01:35:26,362
to the chest and fell.

2784
01:35:26,362 --> 01:35:29,185
Percy kept running, eventually
jumping into a freezing river

2785
01:35:29,185 --> 01:35:32,189
and floating unconscious to freedom.

2786
01:35:32,189 --> 01:35:34,548
He did not remember waking
up on a fishing boat.

2787
01:35:34,548 --> 01:35:37,170
He barely remembered the next two years,

2788
01:35:37,170 --> 01:35:40,767
as he slowly made his way
as far south as possible.

2789
01:35:40,767 --> 01:35:43,607
Then one night, Percy had a dream.

2790
01:35:43,607 --> 01:35:46,504
A roaring cloud of smoke
offered him vengeance

2791
01:35:46,504 --> 01:35:49,229
against those who destroyed his family.

2792
01:35:49,229 --> 01:35:53,611
When he awoke, Percy began
to design his first gun.

2793
01:35:53,611 --> 01:35:55,491
(gun cocking)

2794
01:35:55,491 --> 01:35:57,040
(gun firing)

2795
01:35:57,040 --> 01:35:59,690
SAM: Oh, you haven't heard
of Scanlan Shorthalt?

2796
01:35:59,690 --> 01:36:01,585
Well, gird your loins, ladies,

2797
01:36:01,585 --> 01:36:03,523
because he has his eye on you.

2798
01:36:03,523 --> 01:36:06,088
A talented musician, master of disguise,

2799
01:36:06,088 --> 01:36:08,177
and dashingly handsome in his own mind,

2800
01:36:08,177 --> 01:36:10,638
Scanlan sings songs almost as much

2801
01:36:10,638 --> 01:36:13,033
as he sings his own praises.

2802
01:36:13,033 --> 01:36:16,295
Born a poor gnome, Scanlan
used his endless charm

2803
01:36:16,295 --> 01:36:18,794
and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin

2804
01:36:18,794 --> 01:36:21,021
and support his single mother.

2805
01:36:21,021 --> 01:36:23,267
One day he was discovered
by a half-orc promoter

2806
01:36:23,267 --> 01:36:27,675
and joined Dr. Dranzel's
Spectacular Traveling Troupe,

2807
01:36:27,675 --> 01:36:29,671
where he learned the ways of the world

2808
01:36:29,671 --> 01:36:33,608
and honed his skills as
a bard extraordinaire.

2809
01:36:33,608 --> 01:36:36,227
A loner much of his life,
Scanlan has never quite come

2810
01:36:36,227 --> 01:36:38,328
to terms with the violent
death of his mother

2811
01:36:38,328 --> 01:36:40,449
at the hands of a goblin invasion.

2812
01:36:40,449 --> 01:36:42,669
While his years on the road provided many,

2813
01:36:42,669 --> 01:36:46,404
shall we say, educational
experiences with the opposite sex,

2814
01:36:46,404 --> 01:36:49,741
deep down Scanlan yearns for
the one thing he's never known:

2815
01:36:50,969 --> 01:36:53,636
the true love of a fellow gnome.

2816
01:36:55,060 --> 01:36:57,902
Still, Scanlan considers
himself a lover first,

2817
01:36:57,902 --> 01:37:01,154
performer second, and
fighter distant third.

2818
01:37:01,154 --> 01:37:03,323
On the battlefield,
he'll support his allies

2819
01:37:03,323 --> 01:37:06,244
but rarely draws blood unless it's

2820
01:37:06,244 --> 01:37:08,695
to protect fellow gnome Pike.

2821
01:37:08,695 --> 01:37:11,976
Count on Scanlan for a hearty
laugh, a rollicking song,

2822
01:37:11,976 --> 01:37:14,433
and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts

2823
01:37:14,433 --> 01:37:16,766
and makes the females swoon.

2824
01:37:18,430 --> 01:37:21,211
ORION: (clears throat)
Greetings and salutations.

2825
01:37:21,211 --> 01:37:23,810
I am Tiberius Stormwind.

2826
01:37:23,810 --> 01:37:26,736
I hail from a town called
Ty'rex, located in the heart

2827
01:37:26,736 --> 01:37:30,347
of Draconia, from a
politically respected family.

2828
01:37:30,347 --> 01:37:32,088
At the age of 15, I succeeded

2829
01:37:32,088 --> 01:37:35,119
in passing the Sorcerer's Rite,
showing prodigy-like control

2830
01:37:35,119 --> 01:37:35,952
of my magic.

2831
01:37:35,952 --> 01:37:38,450
The judges and the Draconian
high council were amazed

2832
01:37:38,450 --> 01:37:40,480
at how powerful my spells were

2833
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:42,578
for how long I had been training.

2834
01:37:42,578 --> 01:37:44,886
At 20 years old, I was the
youngest appointed member

2835
01:37:44,886 --> 01:37:47,540
of the magic guild in Draconian history.

2836
01:37:47,540 --> 01:37:50,069
For the next few years, I
almost went mad from the malaise

2837
01:37:50,069 --> 01:37:53,986
of being a guild member,
as it's rather boring.

2838
01:37:53,986 --> 01:37:56,329
However, one day I
happened upon a chamber,

2839
01:37:56,329 --> 01:37:58,333
unused for quite some time.

2840
01:37:58,333 --> 01:38:00,793
In the room were stacks of books and maps

2841
01:38:00,793 --> 01:38:03,811
of the surrounding cities and
areas around the known world.

2842
01:38:03,811 --> 01:38:06,280
For months I would frequent the chamber

2843
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:08,148
and learned of artifacts from legend.

2844
01:38:08,148 --> 01:38:10,959
After a long period of research,
I made a list of artifacts

2845
01:38:10,959 --> 01:38:12,571
that caught my eye.

2846
01:38:12,571 --> 01:38:14,773
I brought these findings
to the high council

2847
01:38:14,773 --> 01:38:17,464
and was told that all of the
information in the chamber

2848
01:38:17,464 --> 01:38:20,160
I stumbled upon was either
believed to be fiction

2849
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:23,770
or unsolvable mysteries and
hence were lost forever.

2850
01:38:23,770 --> 01:38:26,647
I found those answers to be unacceptable.

2851
01:38:26,647 --> 01:38:28,824
A year later I devised a ruse and managed

2852
01:38:28,824 --> 01:38:31,250
to convince the city council
to lend support in me

2853
01:38:31,250 --> 01:38:33,746
leaving Draconia on a mission
of peace and diplomacy

2854
01:38:33,746 --> 01:38:35,609
for the surrounding kingdoms.

2855
01:38:35,609 --> 01:38:38,027
Going from town to town and
making friends and allies,

2856
01:38:38,027 --> 01:38:39,912
in and for the name of Draconia.

2857
01:38:39,912 --> 01:38:43,577
Being a red dragonborn, I had
quite the task on my hands

2858
01:38:43,577 --> 01:38:46,460
in that respect, but it
was exactly what I needed,

2859
01:38:46,460 --> 01:38:49,210
so I could explore the world
and find these artifacts,

2860
01:38:49,210 --> 01:38:52,102
as I felt the truth was out there.

2861
01:38:52,102 --> 01:38:53,977
Some may describe me as buffoonish,

2862
01:38:53,977 --> 01:38:56,789
but I say poppycock to
all that. (stammers)

2863
01:38:56,789 --> 01:38:59,091
I am much sharper than
most give me credit for.

2864
01:38:59,091 --> 01:39:02,348
I just don't pay attention
to things sometimes.

2865
01:39:02,348 --> 01:39:05,261
I've also been known to
be rather cunning, loyal,

2866
01:39:05,261 --> 01:39:08,261
happy-go-lucky, and well, dangerous.

2867
01:39:09,340 --> 01:39:12,518
I can't help but show my true
scales every now and then.

2868
01:39:12,518 --> 01:39:17,512
But overall, I think I'm quite
friendly for a dragonborn.

2869
01:39:17,512 --> 01:39:19,665
LIAM: Never entirely
welcome in the company

2870
01:39:19,665 --> 01:39:22,326
of elves or men, Vax'ildan
learned at a young age

2871
01:39:22,326 --> 01:39:25,388
to skip past formality, preferring instead

2872
01:39:25,388 --> 01:39:28,100
to invite himself in your door.

2873
01:39:28,100 --> 01:39:30,705
Along with twin sister
Vex'ahlia, Vax was born

2874
01:39:30,705 --> 01:39:33,442
by a chance encounter
between elven royalty

2875
01:39:33,442 --> 01:39:35,628
and human peasantry.

2876
01:39:35,628 --> 01:39:38,391
Raised by their mother in
their early years, the twins

2877
01:39:38,391 --> 01:39:40,417
were eventually sent off to their father

2878
01:39:40,417 --> 01:39:42,613
in the elven capital of Syngorn.

2879
01:39:42,613 --> 01:39:45,889
But their cool reception among
the elves there never warmed,

2880
01:39:45,889 --> 01:39:48,871
and their time in the capital didn't last.

2881
01:39:48,871 --> 01:39:51,086
The siblings stole away one autumn night

2882
01:39:51,086 --> 01:39:53,785
and set out on the open road.

2883
01:39:53,785 --> 01:39:56,051
After a few years of
wandering, they eventually

2884
01:39:56,051 --> 01:39:58,044
decided to return to their mother

2885
01:39:58,044 --> 01:40:00,594
and journeyed back to
the lands of their youth.

2886
01:40:00,594 --> 01:40:03,235
But instead of finding
their childhood home,

2887
01:40:03,235 --> 01:40:06,350
they returned to a pile of rubble.

2888
01:40:06,350 --> 01:40:09,875
Their mother was gone,
their home burned to ash.

2889
01:40:09,875 --> 01:40:12,363
Pressing the townspeople for answers,

2890
01:40:12,363 --> 01:40:15,696
they learned of the day the dragon came.

2891
01:40:18,807 --> 01:40:22,494
With their ties all severed,
Vax'ildan and his sister

2892
01:40:22,494 --> 01:40:25,455
set out to find their fortune
together in Tal'Dorei.

2893
01:40:25,455 --> 01:40:28,826
An outsider since birth,
Vax quickly learned

2894
01:40:28,826 --> 01:40:32,958
to solve life's challenges
in his own particular way,

2895
01:40:32,958 --> 01:40:35,822
often by sidestepping them entirely.

2896
01:40:35,822 --> 01:40:39,549
And when his knack for circumventing
adversity isn't enough--

2897
01:40:39,549 --> 01:40:41,233
(sword slicing)

2898
01:40:41,233 --> 01:40:43,915
--the way of blades the
elves schooled him in

2899
01:40:43,915 --> 01:40:46,649
more than makes up the difference.

2900
01:40:46,649 --> 01:40:49,220
LAURA: Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia

2901
01:40:49,220 --> 01:40:51,961
has spent most of her life
suffering the cool reception

2902
01:40:51,961 --> 01:40:55,465
of a people who don't fully accept her.

2903
01:40:55,465 --> 01:40:58,885
Born of a human mother
and an elven father,

2904
01:40:58,885 --> 01:41:01,750
who only later in life took an
interest in their existence,

2905
01:41:01,750 --> 01:41:04,888
Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax'ildan

2906
01:41:04,888 --> 01:41:08,711
quickly realized the only
people they could truly rely on

2907
01:41:08,711 --> 01:41:11,211
in this world were each other.

2908
01:41:12,325 --> 01:41:14,374
It was at the age of ten
when the two were taken

2909
01:41:14,374 --> 01:41:17,163
from their mother and
brought to live in Syngorn,

2910
01:41:17,163 --> 01:41:19,877
the isolated elven city
for which their father

2911
01:41:19,877 --> 01:41:21,779
was an ambassador.

2912
01:41:21,779 --> 01:41:25,810
He quietly took them in but
always kept an icy distance,

2913
01:41:25,810 --> 01:41:28,771
and after too many years
of disdainful looks,

2914
01:41:28,771 --> 01:41:32,078
the pair decided to leave
his indifference behind

2915
01:41:32,078 --> 01:41:34,707
and set out on their own.

2916
01:41:34,707 --> 01:41:38,174
Vax took to the cities,
stealing small trinkets

2917
01:41:38,174 --> 01:41:40,771
and learning the ways of the thief,

2918
01:41:40,771 --> 01:41:43,434
while Vex kept to the woods.

2919
01:41:43,434 --> 01:41:46,012
She preferred the isolation.

2920
01:41:46,012 --> 01:41:48,242
Always the keen observer, she learned

2921
01:41:48,242 --> 01:41:52,430
to hunt and to track, to spy and to shoot.

2922
01:41:52,430 --> 01:41:55,234
And through a series of fateful events,

2923
01:41:55,234 --> 01:41:58,822
earned herself a companion
in the form of a bear,

2924
01:41:58,822 --> 01:42:01,414
her own stolen Trinket,

2925
01:42:01,414 --> 01:42:05,223
to fight alongside her
and protect her fiercely.

2926
01:42:05,223 --> 01:42:09,140
Also, he is adorable and
gives expert massages.

2927
01:42:10,367 --> 01:42:11,740
PRODUCER: And back to you.

2928
01:42:11,740 --> 01:42:12,904
Welcome back.

2929
01:42:12,904 --> 01:42:13,954
Thank you for waiting.

2930
01:42:13,954 --> 01:42:15,938
We've all had our fill of snacks, drinks,

2931
01:42:15,938 --> 01:42:18,848
and relieving ourselves of
the ones we had earlier.

2932
01:42:18,848 --> 01:42:22,787
So, before we return, we
actually want to thank you guys

2933
01:42:22,787 --> 01:42:24,667
for having all the subscriptions you have.

2934
01:42:24,667 --> 01:42:26,388
Since we started playing, we
hit a thousand very quickly.

2935
01:42:26,388 --> 01:42:27,313
You guys are awesome.

2936
01:42:27,313 --> 01:42:28,146
TRAVIS: Yeah!

2937
01:42:28,146 --> 01:42:28,979
So thank you for that.

2938
01:42:28,979 --> 01:42:29,812
Big round of applause.

2939
01:42:29,812 --> 01:42:31,108
TRAVIS: Round of applause.

2940
01:42:31,108 --> 01:42:32,234
Subscriptions have been awesome.

2941
01:42:32,234 --> 01:42:35,224
And as such, we have a winner
for these evening's event.

2942
01:42:35,224 --> 01:42:36,180
Hi, Tiberius.

2943
01:42:36,180 --> 01:42:37,026
ORION: Sorry everyone.

2944
01:42:37,026 --> 01:42:39,510
Tiberius has returned.

2945
01:42:39,510 --> 01:42:41,760
So, in character as always.

2946
01:42:44,738 --> 01:42:46,137
So, the winner of the
evening is going to win

2947
01:42:46,137 --> 01:42:49,239
both a signed photo of
the cast of Critical Role

2948
01:42:49,239 --> 01:42:52,571
as well as a signed Player's
Handbook of D&amp;D's 5th Edition

2949
01:42:52,571 --> 01:42:56,037
is: (clears throat)

2950
01:42:56,037 --> 01:42:57,138
SAM: Visitor.

2951
01:42:57,138 --> 01:42:59,620
(group laughs)

2952
01:42:59,620 --> 01:43:01,912
No, on the backside.

2953
01:43:01,912 --> 01:43:03,912
The winner is Yareth.

2954
01:43:05,639 --> 01:43:06,521
Congratulations.

2955
01:43:06,521 --> 01:43:08,501
Thank you for subscribing
and paying attention

2956
01:43:08,501 --> 01:43:10,179
and being in the chatroom
and being awesome.

2957
01:43:10,179 --> 01:43:11,157
We're gonna go ahead and
get your information,

2958
01:43:11,157 --> 01:43:12,417
and we're gonna make sure that you

2959
01:43:12,417 --> 01:43:14,678
get our awesome first
Critical Role giveaway.

2960
01:43:14,678 --> 01:43:15,991
(group cheers and claps)

2961
01:43:15,991 --> 01:43:18,058
Well done, Yareth.
Thank you for coming.

2962
01:43:18,058 --> 01:43:18,891
MARISHA: Yareth.

2963
01:43:18,891 --> 01:43:21,139
(group repeats Yalreth in funny voices)

2964
01:43:21,139 --> 01:43:21,972
MATT: All right.

2965
01:43:21,972 --> 01:43:23,285
(Marisha speaks gibberish)

2966
01:43:23,285 --> 01:43:25,253
LIAM: Enjoy your Player's Handbook 5E.

2967
01:43:25,253 --> 01:43:28,589
MATT: (laughs) Hopefully more
to come down the road.

2968
01:43:28,589 --> 01:43:30,311
We'll have more fun things for you guys.

2969
01:43:30,311 --> 01:43:31,672
So, anyway.

2970
01:43:31,672 --> 01:43:34,518
So, bringing it back to the game at hand.

2971
01:43:34,518 --> 01:43:37,235
As you've stepped into this
large, cavernous space,

2972
01:43:37,235 --> 01:43:41,402
you can hear the rush of water
as the underground river

2973
01:43:41,402 --> 01:43:44,396
begins to turn into a waterfall and drifts

2974
01:43:44,396 --> 01:43:46,516
into a smaller body of water.

2975
01:43:46,516 --> 01:43:48,954
It's just out of sight
beyond this cliff face.

2976
01:43:48,954 --> 01:43:51,441
Into this open, cavernous area.

2977
01:43:51,441 --> 01:43:53,069
LAURA: Oh, we just stealthed.

2978
01:43:53,069 --> 01:43:56,406
MATT: You guys also stealthed, and
what did you roll for stealth?

2979
01:43:56,406 --> 01:43:57,742
LAURA: I rolled 17.

2980
01:43:57,742 --> 01:43:59,246
MATT: 17, got it.
All right.

2981
01:43:59,246 --> 01:44:00,690
LIAM: Oh, less than that.

2982
01:44:00,690 --> 01:44:01,763
LAURA: You didn't.

2983
01:44:01,763 --> 01:44:03,516
LIAM: Oh, no I didn't, 18.

2984
01:44:03,516 --> 01:44:04,349
MATT: All right.

2985
01:44:04,349 --> 01:44:06,592
LAURA: You were already stealthed, though.

2986
01:44:06,592 --> 01:44:07,759
LIAM: That's true.

2987
01:44:08,331 --> 01:44:11,402
MATT: As you guys step into this space,

2988
01:44:11,402 --> 01:44:14,152
there are sections of large rock,

2989
01:44:15,347 --> 01:44:17,292
portions of stone that just jut out

2990
01:44:17,292 --> 01:44:19,762
and block off portions
from your view of this area.

2991
01:44:19,762 --> 01:44:21,725
Giant stalagmites and stalactites that

2992
01:44:21,725 --> 01:44:23,995
just permeate the entirety of this cavern,

2993
01:44:23,995 --> 01:44:26,965
which has been long, just
building and building

2994
01:44:26,965 --> 01:44:30,396
with elements drawn from the ceiling,

2995
01:44:30,396 --> 01:44:32,250
from the waters that flow through.

2996
01:44:32,250 --> 01:44:34,233
You also faintly see a light source--

2997
01:44:34,233 --> 01:44:35,456
LAURA: (whispers) Oh no.

2998
01:44:35,456 --> 01:44:38,186
MATT: --behind one of those rock
pillars in the distance.

2999
01:44:38,186 --> 01:44:39,658
LAURA: (whispers) Should we go 
check it out?

3000
01:44:39,658 --> 01:44:41,466
LIAM: Do we perceive anything in here with us

3001
01:44:41,466 --> 01:44:43,009
before going that far in, yes?

3002
01:44:43,009 --> 01:44:45,176
MATT: Make a perception check.

3003
01:44:47,177 --> 01:44:48,457
LIAM: 18.

3004
01:44:48,457 --> 01:44:49,290
MATT: 18?

3005
01:44:49,290 --> 01:44:50,688
LIAM: Yes.

3006
01:44:50,688 --> 01:44:54,120
MATT: You hear a very, very faint
sound in the distance.

3007
01:44:55,130 --> 01:44:56,199
(sharp noise)

3008
01:44:56,199 --> 01:44:57,269
SAM: Jesus.

3009
01:44:57,269 --> 01:44:58,339
(laughing)

3010
01:44:58,339 --> 01:45:00,172
ORION: Did you hear that?

3011
01:45:00,172 --> 01:45:02,262
MATT: That's not the sound.

3012
01:45:02,262 --> 01:45:03,411
Tiberius.

3013
01:45:03,411 --> 01:45:04,543
ORION: I'm sorry.

3014
01:45:04,543 --> 01:45:06,959
LAURA: I have a passive perception of 21.

3015
01:45:06,959 --> 01:45:08,420
MATT: Yes you do.

3016
01:45:10,476 --> 01:45:11,476
You hear a:

3017
01:45:12,106 --> 01:45:13,796
(clicks tongue quickly)

3018
01:45:13,796 --> 01:45:14,838
LAURA: Oh, no.

3019
01:45:14,838 --> 01:45:15,838
SAM: A skittering.

3020
01:45:15,838 --> 01:45:17,275
MATT: (continues clicking)

3021
01:45:17,275 --> 01:45:19,889
LIAM: I might hear spiders.

3022
01:45:19,889 --> 01:45:20,772
MARISHA: Oh.

3023
01:45:20,772 --> 01:45:21,677
LAURA: Ugh.

3024
01:45:21,677 --> 01:45:22,582
TRAVIS: Or crab.

3025
01:45:22,582 --> 01:45:23,547
LIAM: Or something.

3026
01:45:23,547 --> 01:45:25,386
MARISHA: Making it old school.

3027
01:45:25,386 --> 01:45:29,286
SAM: Maybe it's a very faint
maraca dance of some sort.

3028
01:45:29,286 --> 01:45:30,866
LAURA: What direction is it coming from?

3029
01:45:30,866 --> 01:45:31,969
TRAVIS: That would be better.

3030
01:45:31,969 --> 01:45:33,661
MATT: It's hard to tell at this
point, it seems to be

3031
01:45:33,661 --> 01:45:36,411
just kind of loosely atmospheric.

3032
01:45:37,431 --> 01:45:39,732
TRAVIS: Is the light coming from over the water?

3033
01:45:39,732 --> 01:45:42,104
MATT: The very, very faint 
light you see, no.

3034
01:45:42,104 --> 01:45:44,320
It's adjacent to the
water to the right of you.

3035
01:45:44,320 --> 01:45:45,170
TRAVIS: Okay.

3036
01:45:45,170 --> 01:45:46,793
LIAM: I think we're dealing with spiders.

3037
01:45:46,793 --> 01:45:47,947
MATT: (continues clicking)

3038
01:45:47,947 --> 01:45:49,281
LAURA: I think you guys should hang back,

3039
01:45:49,281 --> 01:45:51,826
and we should stealth over
and see how many it looks like

3040
01:45:51,826 --> 01:45:52,760
we're dealing with.

3041
01:45:52,760 --> 01:45:54,452
LIAM: The twins will creep forward.

3042
01:45:54,452 --> 01:45:56,297
MATT: Okay. You both creep forward.

3043
01:45:56,297 --> 01:45:58,890
LAURA: Trinket stays with the group.
Trinket, stay with Grog.

3044
01:45:58,890 --> 01:46:00,623
ORION: I'm gonna dispel my light spell.

3045
01:46:00,623 --> 01:46:04,224
MATT: Pitch darkness falls upon all of you.

3046
01:46:04,224 --> 01:46:05,687
TRAVIS: What did you do that for?

3047
01:46:05,687 --> 01:46:07,830
SAM: Because now they don't know 
where we are.

3048
01:46:07,830 --> 01:46:09,193
LAURA: But we can't see anything.

3049
01:46:09,194 --> 01:46:10,377
TRAVIS: They're spiders.

3050
01:46:10,377 --> 01:46:11,816
MARISHA: While he does that,

3051
01:46:11,816 --> 01:46:14,430
I'm gonna go ahead and
turn into a cave bear.

3052
01:46:14,430 --> 01:46:15,927
ORION: Can you not see now?

3053
01:46:15,927 --> 01:46:17,527
LAURA: We can see in dim light.

3054
01:46:17,527 --> 01:46:19,514
MARISHA: Cave bears have darkvision.

3055
01:46:19,514 --> 01:46:20,887
MARISHA: I'm pretty sure.

3056
01:46:20,887 --> 01:46:22,139
LIAM: No, dim light only.

3057
01:46:22,139 --> 01:46:23,072
MATT: Do they?

3058
01:46:23,072 --> 01:46:24,605
LAURA: What'd you turn into?

3059
01:46:24,605 --> 01:46:27,373
ORION: It doesn't matter, do you
want me to turn it back on?

3060
01:46:27,373 --> 01:46:28,439
TALIESIN: A cave bear.

3061
01:46:28,439 --> 01:46:31,268
MARISHA: Yeah, subterranean bears,
they have darkvision.

3062
01:46:31,268 --> 01:46:32,601
MATT: All right. So.

3063
01:46:32,601 --> 01:46:33,870
SAM: He can just make light again.

3064
01:46:33,870 --> 01:46:35,303
MATT: Go ahead and roll a perception check.

3065
01:46:35,303 --> 01:46:36,489
LIAM: Turn it back on.

3066
01:46:36,489 --> 01:46:37,802
MARISHA: No, leave it off!

3067
01:46:37,802 --> 01:46:39,575
ORION: I dispel it again, I'm sorry.

3068
01:46:39,575 --> 01:46:40,818
MARISHA: Fuck! Fuck!

3069
01:46:40,818 --> 01:46:42,992
MATT: Light, light light, light light.

3070
01:46:42,992 --> 01:46:44,349
TALIESIN: How did you do that?

3071
01:46:44,355 --> 01:46:45,939
MARISHA: It's been a bad night.

3072
01:46:45,939 --> 01:46:47,065
LAURA: Oh no.

3073
01:46:47,065 --> 01:46:47,996
MARISHA: 12 total.

3074
01:46:47,996 --> 01:46:51,188
LIAM: Clap on (claps), clap off. (claps)

3075
01:46:51,188 --> 01:46:53,875
MATT: As you glance about in cave bear form,

3076
01:46:53,875 --> 01:46:58,089
you look up and all you can
make out is shifting movement

3077
01:46:58,089 --> 01:46:59,540
across the ceiling.

3078
01:46:59,540 --> 01:47:01,880
(group groans at once)

3079
01:47:01,880 --> 01:47:03,130
MATT: But it's large.

3080
01:47:04,502 --> 01:47:06,442
It's not a small creature.

3081
01:47:07,706 --> 01:47:09,877
You glance off to your
left and you look up

3082
01:47:09,877 --> 01:47:11,197
and you see a second one.

3083
01:47:11,197 --> 01:47:12,897
LAURA: Oh no.
TRAVIS: Oh fuck.

3084
01:47:12,897 --> 01:47:14,445
MATT: And both dislodge.

3085
01:47:14,445 --> 01:47:15,278
LAURA: Oh no!

3086
01:47:15,278 --> 01:47:17,916
MATT: All of you hear two 
loud, cacophonous,

3087
01:47:17,916 --> 01:47:20,358
thunderous slam sounds--
(imitates loud thudding)

3088
01:47:20,358 --> 01:47:22,064
LAURA: Definitely hit light now.

3089
01:47:22,064 --> 01:47:24,697
MATT: --on the ground next to you--
(screeching noise)

3090
01:47:24,697 --> 01:47:26,717
LIAM: I quickly whisper to my
sister, to the boundaries.

3091
01:47:26,717 --> 01:47:28,683
MARISHA: And I just go: (roaring noise)

3092
01:47:28,683 --> 01:47:29,516
ORION: Light!

3093
01:47:29,516 --> 01:47:30,751
MATT: All right.

3094
01:47:30,751 --> 01:47:33,348
LIAM: Vex and Vax dance backwards
against the walls.

3095
01:47:33,348 --> 01:47:34,925
MATT: There is a surprise round.

3096
01:47:34,925 --> 01:47:35,758
LAURA: Oh, no.

3097
01:47:35,758 --> 01:47:36,864
(group groans)

3098
01:47:36,864 --> 01:47:38,123
TRAVIS: Oh God.

3099
01:47:38,123 --> 01:47:39,343
LIAM: But I heard them.

3100
01:47:39,343 --> 01:47:42,156
MARISHA: I know. 
(roars)

3101
01:47:42,156 --> 01:47:44,048
LAURA: Transform back.

3102
01:47:44,048 --> 01:47:45,542
MATT: All right.

3103
01:47:45,542 --> 01:47:47,955
So you guys are stealthed
off to the side there.

3104
01:47:47,955 --> 01:47:49,763
LIAM: That's beautiful.

3105
01:47:49,763 --> 01:47:51,163
LAURA: I'm on the other side.

3106
01:47:51,163 --> 01:47:52,689
LIAM: Look at that fun map.

3107
01:47:52,689 --> 01:47:53,868
MATT: There's Trinket.

3108
01:47:53,868 --> 01:47:55,629
LIAM: Thank you, Matt, 
for doing all the work

3109
01:47:55,629 --> 01:47:56,781
on these maps and shit.

3110
01:47:56,781 --> 01:47:58,069
MATT: That's what I do.

3111
01:47:58,069 --> 01:48:00,719
So there's the water there,
rushing off into the waterfall

3112
01:48:00,719 --> 01:48:01,964
that goes further down.

3113
01:48:01,964 --> 01:48:03,422
LAURA: Can I stealth
against the other wall?

3114
01:48:03,422 --> 01:48:05,514
TRAVIS: Waterfall is where on that map?

3115
01:48:05,514 --> 01:48:06,904
MATT: The waterfall is right here.

3116
01:48:06,904 --> 01:48:07,737
TRAVIS: Got it.

3117
01:48:07,737 --> 01:48:10,975
MATT: So the river kind of pours over,
falls into the water below.

3118
01:48:10,975 --> 01:48:14,625
There are some of these
large rock elements here.

3119
01:48:14,625 --> 01:48:15,739
SAM: What are they?

3120
01:48:15,739 --> 01:48:18,118
MATT: You cannot tell what's 
beyond this area,

3121
01:48:18,118 --> 01:48:20,845
which is where the light
source is coming from.

3122
01:48:24,098 --> 01:48:25,251
(imitates thudding)

3123
01:48:25,251 --> 01:48:26,822
LAURA: Oh no!
(group groans)

3124
01:48:26,822 --> 01:48:27,858
(imitates thudding)

3125
01:48:27,858 --> 01:48:29,707
TRAVIS: Those look like umber hulks.

3126
01:48:29,707 --> 01:48:30,520
MATT: They are.

3127
01:48:30,520 --> 01:48:32,373
(group screams)

3128
01:48:32,373 --> 01:48:34,864
You've had one brief run-in
with a single umber hulk

3129
01:48:34,864 --> 01:48:35,689
in the past.

3130
01:48:35,689 --> 01:48:36,922
LAURA: Now we have two.

3131
01:48:36,922 --> 01:48:38,858
As two slam into the ground beside you,

3132
01:48:38,858 --> 01:48:40,750
dropping from the ceiling portion.

3133
01:48:40,750 --> 01:48:41,692
LAURA: Fudge!

3134
01:48:41,692 --> 01:48:42,827
TRAVIS: I have their claws still.

3135
01:48:42,827 --> 01:48:44,278
LAURA: Wait, do you guys remember--

3136
01:48:44,278 --> 01:48:45,478
(Matt growls and snarls)

3137
01:48:45,478 --> 01:48:46,614
LAURA: Do they respond to vibration?

3138
01:48:46,614 --> 01:48:48,435
ORION: I cast stoneskin
on myself immediately.

3139
01:48:48,435 --> 01:48:50,649
You don't have that much
time, unfortunately.

3140
01:48:50,649 --> 01:48:53,164
Because they are upon
you, it a surprise round.

3141
01:48:53,164 --> 01:48:54,300
TRAVIS: Shit!

3142
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:56,021
LAURA: Do they respond to vibration?

3143
01:48:56,021 --> 01:48:56,925
I forget.

3144
01:48:56,925 --> 01:48:58,890
TRAVIS: They responded to something.

3145
01:48:58,890 --> 01:49:01,044
MATT: They respond to the something.

3146
01:49:01,044 --> 01:49:03,482
LAURA: Can we remember with
investigation or insight?

3147
01:49:03,482 --> 01:49:05,550
LIAM: Limericks, limericks,
they respond to limericks.

3148
01:49:05,550 --> 01:49:07,609
MATT: So this one shifts up over there,

3149
01:49:07,609 --> 01:49:10,316
and this one moves up to there.

3150
01:49:10,316 --> 01:49:12,425
Gleans past you, as it
does not notice you.

3151
01:49:12,425 --> 01:49:14,184
LAURA: Yeah, but it's still big.

3152
01:49:14,184 --> 01:49:16,354
MATT: This one comes towards you, Percy.

3153
01:49:16,354 --> 01:49:17,467
TALIESIN: Damn it.

3154
01:49:17,467 --> 01:49:19,786
MATT: Attacking you with each of its
claws and its mandibles.

3155
01:49:19,786 --> 01:49:22,363
The first strike comes
at you with a 13 to hit

3156
01:49:22,363 --> 01:49:23,903
with its first claw.

3157
01:49:23,903 --> 01:49:24,736
What's your AC?

3158
01:49:24,736 --> 01:49:25,784
TALIESIN: Ah, 17.

3159
01:49:25,784 --> 01:49:28,339
MATT: You, woomf, just manage
to dodge out of the way

3160
01:49:28,339 --> 01:49:30,948
as these giant-bladed claws
sweep next to your face.

3161
01:49:31,248 --> 01:49:32,881
The second strike comes to you at a 21.

3162
01:49:32,881 --> 01:49:34,227
TRAVIS: Oh shit.
That hits.

3163
01:49:34,227 --> 01:49:35,380
TALIESIN: That hits.

3164
01:49:35,380 --> 01:49:38,713
I'm going to use a gunslinger's dodge.

3165
01:49:40,146 --> 01:49:41,549
LAURA: Gunslinger's dodge.

3166
01:49:41,549 --> 01:49:43,595
TALIESIN: Wait, let's see if I can do this.

3167
01:49:43,595 --> 01:49:45,109
It's not enough, nevermind, so no.

3168
01:49:45,109 --> 01:49:46,772
I just gotta take it.

3169
01:49:46,772 --> 01:49:50,378
MATT: All right, so the claw finds
purchase across your torso.

3170
01:49:50,378 --> 01:49:52,626
(imitates claw slicing) 
The armor catches most of it.

3171
01:49:52,626 --> 01:49:56,072
However, the slash does
leave an impact on you,

3172
01:49:56,072 --> 01:49:58,207
as you can feel the taste of iron

3173
01:49:58,207 --> 01:49:59,614
in the back of your throat.

3174
01:49:59,614 --> 01:50:01,737
You suffer nine points of slashing damage.

3175
01:50:01,737 --> 01:50:02,703
TALIESIN: Oh, okay.

3176
01:50:02,703 --> 01:50:04,641
MATT: And just as you pull back 
the mandibles,

3177
01:50:04,641 --> 01:50:05,825
time to crunch down upon you.

3178
01:50:05,825 --> 01:50:08,327
And that is going to be a 27 to hit.

3179
01:50:08,327 --> 01:50:09,683
LAURA: Oh, no.

3180
01:50:09,683 --> 01:50:10,997
TRAVIS: Do their eyes do something?

3181
01:50:10,997 --> 01:50:13,011
MATT: You take 14 points 
of slashing damage,

3182
01:50:13,011 --> 01:50:15,332
as the mandibles slice down,
clamping onto your shoulder.

3183
01:50:15,332 --> 01:50:17,179
You manage to pull free, but in doing so,

3184
01:50:17,179 --> 01:50:19,084
you wrench the pointed
portions of the mandible

3185
01:50:19,084 --> 01:50:21,505
across your shoulder,
pulling open the flesh

3186
01:50:21,505 --> 01:50:23,340
in this horrible jagged pattern.

3187
01:50:24,550 --> 01:50:25,416
TALIESIN: Ow.

3188
01:50:25,416 --> 01:50:27,258
MATT: That brings us to the other one,

3189
01:50:27,258 --> 01:50:28,708
who is attacking Grog.

3190
01:50:28,708 --> 01:50:29,541
MARISHA: Grog!

3191
01:50:29,541 --> 01:50:31,334
You're right there in front of it.

3192
01:50:31,334 --> 01:50:33,749
The biggest and most
viable visual it can find.

3193
01:50:33,749 --> 01:50:35,422
SAM: ♫ No motherfucker, miss ♫

3194
01:50:35,422 --> 01:50:38,538
I start singing using my
Cutting Words reaction.

3195
01:50:39,428 --> 01:50:41,052
To try to distract him.

3196
01:50:41,052 --> 01:50:42,815
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll your d8

3197
01:50:42,815 --> 01:50:44,188
to reduce his attack roll.

3198
01:50:44,188 --> 01:50:46,194
TRAVIS: (laughs) No motherfucker, miss.

3199
01:50:46,194 --> 01:50:47,027
SAM: d8?

3200
01:50:47,027 --> 01:50:47,860
MATT: d8.

3201
01:50:47,860 --> 01:50:48,804
SAM: Three.

3202
01:50:48,804 --> 01:50:49,637
MATT: All right.

3203
01:50:50,610 --> 01:50:53,360
That would have been a 20 to hit.

3204
01:50:54,708 --> 01:50:56,028
That brings it to a 17.

3205
01:50:56,028 --> 01:50:56,861
TRAVIS: 18.

3206
01:50:56,861 --> 01:50:58,183
(group cheers)

3207
01:50:58,183 --> 01:50:59,850
SAM: I saved your life!

3208
01:51:00,370 --> 01:51:02,572
MATT: So, as you begin singing out,

3209
01:51:02,572 --> 01:51:03,775
as it pulls back with--

3210
01:51:03,775 --> 01:51:05,082
SAM: ♫ No motherfucker ♫

3211
01:51:05,082 --> 01:51:06,884
MATT: --its mandibles to strike at Grog,

3212
01:51:06,884 --> 01:51:08,972
it (clicks) looks off to you for a second,

3213
01:51:08,972 --> 01:51:10,621
goes back, at which point
Grog has put his axe

3214
01:51:10,621 --> 01:51:12,531
up to its face and is holding it at bay.

3215
01:51:12,531 --> 01:51:14,824
As its mandibles are
tied in with its blades,

3216
01:51:14,824 --> 01:51:16,996
and the handle of the axe
is trying to hold it back.

3217
01:51:16,996 --> 01:51:19,383
It strikes at you with
its two claws, Grog.

3218
01:51:19,383 --> 01:51:20,882
That is going to be a 27.

3219
01:51:20,882 --> 01:51:21,865
TRAVIS: That hits.

3220
01:51:21,865 --> 01:51:22,863
MATT: And a 14.

3221
01:51:22,863 --> 01:51:23,696
TRAVIS: Misses.

3222
01:51:23,696 --> 01:51:25,996
MATT: Okay, then from the
one claw that gets you,

3223
01:51:25,996 --> 01:51:27,560
you take six points of slashing damage.

3224
01:51:27,560 --> 01:51:28,393
TRAVIS: Okay.

3225
01:51:28,393 --> 01:51:30,248
MATT: All right everyone, roll initiative.

3226
01:51:30,248 --> 01:51:31,237
(group groans)

3227
01:51:31,237 --> 01:51:32,892
LAURA: I'm so scared to roll.

3228
01:51:32,892 --> 01:51:34,542
MARISHA: I know, it's been so bad.

3229
01:51:35,237 --> 01:51:36,690
SAM: Best one of I've had.

3230
01:51:36,690 --> 01:51:38,042
TALIESIN: Ah, not horrible.

3231
01:51:38,042 --> 01:51:38,875
LAURA: Oh, good.

3232
01:51:38,875 --> 01:51:40,050
TRAVIS: Ball sack.

3233
01:51:40,050 --> 01:51:41,383
MARISHA: Uh, it's okay.

3234
01:51:42,293 --> 01:51:44,082
MATT: All right, so, 25 to 20?

3235
01:51:44,082 --> 01:51:45,126
LAURA: 24.

3236
01:51:45,126 --> 01:51:46,000
MATT: 24.

3237
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:47,673
TRAVIS: There you go.
A little redemption.

3238
01:51:47,673 --> 01:51:48,499
LAURA: That's right.

3239
01:51:48,499 --> 01:51:49,695
MATT: Nice, we got some Vex up top.

3240
01:51:49,695 --> 01:51:51,828
20 to 15 anyone?

3241
01:51:51,828 --> 01:51:52,661
TALIESIN: 17.

3242
01:51:52,661 --> 01:51:53,974
MARISHA: 17 as well.

3243
01:51:53,974 --> 01:51:54,806
SAM: 19.

3244
01:51:54,806 --> 01:51:55,639
TRAVIS: Ah, yeah.

3245
01:51:55,639 --> 01:51:56,601
LIAM: 15, 15.

3246
01:51:56,601 --> 01:51:58,769
MATT: All right, 
got some Scanlan up there.

3247
01:51:58,769 --> 01:51:59,602
17, 17.

3248
01:51:59,602 --> 01:52:02,025
LAURA: (whispers) They're both surrounding me
even with my awesome things.

3249
01:52:02,025 --> 01:52:03,292
MATT: Percy, Keyleth.

3250
01:52:09,500 --> 01:52:10,508
MATT: So 15 to--

3251
01:52:10,508 --> 01:52:11,516
LIAM: 15.

3252
01:52:11,516 --> 01:52:12,524
MATT: 15.

3253
01:52:12,524 --> 01:52:14,049
ORION: 13.

3254
01:52:14,049 --> 01:52:14,882
TRAVIS: I'm 14.

3255
01:52:15,910 --> 01:52:17,363
Tiberius and I are 13-14.

3256
01:52:17,363 --> 01:52:18,574
LAURA: Ugh, come on Grog!

3257
01:52:18,574 --> 01:52:19,710
MATT: Wait, uh, 14?

3258
01:52:19,710 --> 01:52:20,543
ORION: 13.

3259
01:52:20,543 --> 01:52:21,376
MATT: 14.

3260
01:52:21,376 --> 01:52:22,856
Grog and Tiberius.

3261
01:52:23,421 --> 01:52:25,118
TRAVIS: It's the ghost pepper cookies.

3262
01:52:25,118 --> 01:52:27,075
MATT: All right, cool.

3263
01:52:27,075 --> 01:52:28,996
Top of the round.

3264
01:52:28,996 --> 01:52:29,829
Vex.

3265
01:52:29,829 --> 01:52:31,231
LAURA: Hyah!

3266
01:52:31,231 --> 01:52:34,534
I am going to shoot the one.

3267
01:52:34,534 --> 01:52:36,182
MATT: Before you do that--

3268
01:52:36,182 --> 01:52:37,169
SAM: Oh, shit!

3269
01:52:37,169 --> 01:52:39,504
MATT: As you're going to
reach back, you look over

3270
01:52:39,504 --> 01:52:43,671
into its strange, glistening,
black, dead, insect-like eyes

3271
01:52:43,671 --> 01:52:47,247
of the umber hulk, and
you feel this strange wave

3272
01:52:47,247 --> 01:52:50,599
of mental confusion
hit your head.

3273
01:52:50,599 --> 01:52:52,124
Go ahead and make a--

3274
01:52:52,124 --> 01:52:53,217
TRAVIS: I knew it.

3275
01:52:53,217 --> 01:52:54,928
MATT: Go ahead and make a saving throw.

3276
01:52:54,928 --> 01:52:57,120
This is going to be charisma saving throw.

3277
01:52:57,120 --> 01:52:59,840
MARISHA: Is this what confused you 
and had you running out the door?

3278
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:02,488
TRAVIS: I fell out a fucking 120 foot hole.

3279
01:53:03,186 --> 01:53:05,789
MATT: So you roll d20, add your
charisma saving throw

3280
01:53:05,789 --> 01:53:07,246
at the top of your character.

3281
01:53:07,246 --> 01:53:08,846
LAURA: Okay, so I gotta do my math.

3282
01:53:08,846 --> 01:53:11,468
That's 11, but I get a
plus two from my ring

3283
01:53:11,468 --> 01:53:13,708
that I'm wearing for saving throws, so.

3284
01:53:13,708 --> 01:53:15,173
MATT: Okay, so it's 13.

3285
01:53:15,173 --> 01:53:16,122
LAURA: 13.

3286
01:53:16,122 --> 01:53:17,184
MATT: All right.

3287
01:53:17,184 --> 01:53:19,898
The wave of confusion
takes hold over your brain.

3288
01:53:19,898 --> 01:53:21,950
(group groans)

3289
01:53:21,950 --> 01:53:24,309
We're gonna go ahead and
find out what happens.

3290
01:53:24,309 --> 01:53:25,578
(Laura groans)

3291
01:53:25,578 --> 01:53:27,639
TRAVIS: Maybe he'll ask you to make some cookies.

3292
01:53:27,639 --> 01:53:28,960
MATT: All right--

3293
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:31,181
LAURA: You're gonna have me do 
nothing wrong?

3294
01:53:31,181 --> 01:53:33,760
MATT: You reach for it, and you
space out for a second.

3295
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:35,625
Your hands fall to your side.

3296
01:53:35,625 --> 01:53:37,473
And you stand there.

3297
01:53:38,707 --> 01:53:39,624
TRAVIS: Aw, fuck.

3298
01:53:39,624 --> 01:53:41,822
MATT: Trinket is looking
for some sort of cue

3299
01:53:41,822 --> 01:53:43,045
from you of what to do.

3300
01:53:43,045 --> 01:53:44,768
LAURA: Does he look confused too?

3301
01:53:44,768 --> 01:53:46,901
MATT: No, but Trinket's looking to you

3302
01:53:46,901 --> 01:53:49,073
for some sort of direction
and is getting none.

3303
01:53:49,073 --> 01:53:50,825
This is a very clustered space, too.

3304
01:53:50,825 --> 01:53:52,365
Can barely see you over this.

3305
01:53:52,365 --> 01:53:53,980
MATT: That brings us to Scanlan.

3306
01:53:53,980 --> 01:53:55,652
LAURA: But I was stealthed, though.

3307
01:53:55,652 --> 01:53:56,690
SAM: Don't worry, I'll help you
my dear.

3308
01:53:56,690 --> 01:53:58,540
MATT: I know. Doesn't matter 
if you're stealthed.

3309
01:53:58,540 --> 01:54:00,507
He couldn't see you,
but you could see him.

3310
01:54:00,507 --> 01:54:02,798
SAM: I'm gonna take a
step back behind Trinket.

3311
01:54:02,798 --> 01:54:03,655
MATT: Okay.

3312
01:54:03,655 --> 01:54:04,696
(Travis Laughs)

3313
01:54:04,696 --> 01:54:05,910
LAURA: Good call.

3314
01:54:05,910 --> 01:54:08,330
SAM: Actually, wait. How
far am I from my furthest--

3315
01:54:08,330 --> 01:54:10,125
MATT: Are you averting your gaze
from the guys,

3316
01:54:10,125 --> 01:54:11,538
or are you looking at 'em directly?

3317
01:54:11,538 --> 01:54:12,786
SAM: No, averting my gaze.

3318
01:54:12,786 --> 01:54:14,027
But how far am I from my--

3319
01:54:14,027 --> 01:54:15,488
LAURA: Nobody look at them.

3320
01:54:15,488 --> 01:54:16,651
SAM: --my furthest fellow?

3321
01:54:16,651 --> 01:54:18,798
Oh, I'm 60 feet, okay.

3322
01:54:18,798 --> 01:54:21,548
And I sing my counter-charm song.

3323
01:54:23,812 --> 01:54:26,742
♫ Magic magic, go away,
come again another day ♫

3324
01:54:26,742 --> 01:54:29,287
So all of us have
advantage on saving throws

3325
01:54:29,287 --> 01:54:31,182
for the charming spells.

3326
01:54:31,182 --> 01:54:32,561
If they are charming us.

3327
01:54:32,561 --> 01:54:34,644
I don't know if they are.

3328
01:54:35,554 --> 01:54:36,991
MATT: This is confusion.

3329
01:54:36,991 --> 01:54:38,248
SAM: No, what?

3330
01:54:38,248 --> 01:54:39,692
MATT: I don't think--

3331
01:54:39,692 --> 01:54:42,561
SAM: Frightened or charmed,
it's not the same thing?

3332
01:54:42,561 --> 01:54:43,394
MATT: Mm.

3333
01:54:47,139 --> 01:54:49,368
This is technically a confusion effect.

3334
01:54:49,368 --> 01:54:50,607
So yeah.

3335
01:54:50,607 --> 01:54:51,440
SAM: Okay.

3336
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:52,663
LAURA: Oh, wait. Oh, no.

3337
01:54:53,106 --> 01:54:54,161
SAM: Okay.

3338
01:54:54,161 --> 01:54:56,745
MATT: So as you finish your
song, you're like--

3339
01:54:56,745 --> 01:54:58,354
SAM: It did not work.

3340
01:54:58,354 --> 01:55:01,251
MATT: Doesn't seem to be having
an effect unfortunately.

3341
01:55:01,251 --> 01:55:02,251
SAM: Okay.

3342
01:55:02,251 --> 01:55:05,655
And then as my bonus
action, who got hit first?

3343
01:55:06,607 --> 01:55:07,440
You did?

3344
01:55:07,440 --> 01:55:09,656
I'll just throw a healing word to him.

3345
01:55:09,656 --> 01:55:10,520
MATT: Okay.

3346
01:55:10,520 --> 01:55:12,687
Just go ahead and roll, feeling him.

3347
01:55:12,687 --> 01:55:14,276
That's a d4 plus five.

3348
01:55:14,276 --> 01:55:15,966
Yeah, you got it.

3349
01:55:15,966 --> 01:55:16,799
Percy.

3350
01:55:16,799 --> 01:55:17,632
TALIESIN: Mm.

3351
01:55:17,632 --> 01:55:19,089
MATT: You heal--

3352
01:55:19,089 --> 01:55:20,042
SAM: What is this?

3353
01:55:20,042 --> 01:55:21,025
MATT: It's a four.

3354
01:55:21,025 --> 01:55:22,421
SAM: Oh, that's a four.
Okay.

3355
01:55:22,421 --> 01:55:25,184
MATT: So you heal nine hit
points, and it's your turn.

3356
01:55:25,184 --> 01:55:26,417
What do you got, Percy?

3357
01:55:26,417 --> 01:55:28,590
TALIESIN: Up to 58, let me just
fix that, there we go.

3358
01:55:28,905 --> 01:55:30,945
Okay, where am I on the board?

3359
01:55:30,945 --> 01:55:32,494
MATT: You are right here in front--

3360
01:55:32,494 --> 01:55:33,679
TALIESIN: Okay, so
there's no getting away.

3361
01:55:33,679 --> 01:55:36,135
I'm gonna-- I can basically without--

3362
01:55:36,135 --> 01:55:37,908
I remember I'm not supposed
to look at these things.

3363
01:55:37,908 --> 01:55:39,624
I know where this thing is.

3364
01:55:39,624 --> 01:55:42,004
I can pull my gun and
just take a shot, right?

3365
01:55:42,004 --> 01:55:44,265
MATT: So averting your gaze, 
you take a shot.

3366
01:55:44,265 --> 01:55:46,424
You are at disadvantage
on the attack roll.

3367
01:55:46,424 --> 01:55:47,347
TALIESIN: How much?

3368
01:55:47,347 --> 01:55:48,630
MATT: Just disadvantage.

3369
01:55:48,630 --> 01:55:49,834
TALIESIN: I'm just disadvantage?

3370
01:55:49,834 --> 01:55:50,667
MATT: Yeah.

3371
01:55:50,667 --> 01:55:51,946
TALIESIN: Well okay, that's fine.

3372
01:55:51,946 --> 01:55:54,288
I'm gonna spend a grit
point for a deadshot,

3373
01:55:54,288 --> 01:55:56,694
so I'm gonna get a plus one to hit.

3374
01:55:56,694 --> 01:55:58,944
MATT: All right.
TRAVIS: Come on, Perce.

3375
01:56:00,250 --> 01:56:01,500
TALIESIN: Aha!

3376
01:56:01,500 --> 01:56:05,667
That will be a-- with the plus
one, that's a 28, 29, 30 to hit.

3377
01:56:05,667 --> 01:56:06,500
MATT: Okay.

3378
01:56:06,500 --> 01:56:07,973
TRAVIS: Get after it, nasty!

3379
01:56:07,973 --> 01:56:10,212
MATT: Roll again, as you 
have disadvantage.

3380
01:56:10,212 --> 01:56:11,782
Because you're not looking at it directly.

3381
01:56:11,782 --> 01:56:13,655
LAURA: Ugh, please be good.

3382
01:56:13,655 --> 01:56:15,682
TALIESIN: That's still 25 to hit.

3383
01:56:15,682 --> 01:56:16,515
MATT: That hits.

3384
01:56:16,515 --> 01:56:17,611
TALIESIN: 26, actually.

3385
01:56:17,611 --> 01:56:19,334
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.

3386
01:56:19,334 --> 01:56:21,978
TALIESIN: And then I get extra damage
because I did deadshot.

3387
01:56:21,978 --> 01:56:23,945
So that's plus one, so that will be a--

3388
01:56:24,770 --> 01:56:28,487
it's a 2d8 plus five plus
ice, because I'm hitting

3389
01:56:28,487 --> 01:56:29,904
with my ice shot.

3390
01:56:33,497 --> 01:56:37,493
And that's seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12.

3391
01:56:37,493 --> 01:56:39,493
14 points of ice damage.

3392
01:56:40,574 --> 01:56:42,447
MATT: 14 points of ice damage.
Nice.

3393
01:56:43,026 --> 01:56:45,108
TALIESIN: And then I have a second shot

3394
01:56:45,108 --> 01:56:48,161
and I'm just gonna take one
more shot at him really quick.

3395
01:56:48,161 --> 01:56:50,578
MATT: Okay, also at disadvantage.

3396
01:56:51,476 --> 01:56:52,410
TALIESIN: I fail.

3397
01:56:52,410 --> 01:56:53,953
In fact, my gun jams.

3398
01:56:53,953 --> 01:56:55,524
(group groans)

3399
01:56:55,524 --> 01:56:56,534
MATT: Okay.

3400
01:56:56,534 --> 01:56:58,052
So as you go to fire, it's
like you-- (imitates gun firing)

3401
01:56:58,052 --> 01:56:59,669
fire the first shot averting the gaze.

3402
01:56:59,669 --> 01:57:01,080
LAURA: We're all gonna die.

3403
01:57:01,080 --> 01:57:03,351
You spin the barrel, go back
to go ahead and fire again,

3404
01:57:03,351 --> 01:57:04,811
as you do (imitates gun clicking)

3405
01:57:04,811 --> 01:57:07,454
You pull the trigger for a
second, and you feel a slight

3406
01:57:07,454 --> 01:57:08,512
(imitates fizzled explosion)
inside the barrel.

3407
01:57:08,512 --> 01:57:09,345
TRAVIS: Damn it!

3408
01:57:09,345 --> 01:57:10,178
MARISHA: Oh, no.

3409
01:57:10,178 --> 01:57:12,464
MATT: And you feel the actual
metal get extremely cold,

3410
01:57:12,464 --> 01:57:14,587
and you have you have to shake
it out like, aw, damn it.

3411
01:57:14,587 --> 01:57:18,934
TALIESIN: Since I can't move,
I'm gonna--

3412
01:57:18,934 --> 01:57:22,286
my movement, my minor is gonna
be just fixing my-- yeah, so.

3413
01:57:22,286 --> 01:57:25,146
MATT: Okay, so your action is
just trying to fix the gun?

3414
01:57:25,146 --> 01:57:26,201
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3415
01:57:26,201 --> 01:57:27,034
MATT: All right.

3416
01:57:27,034 --> 01:57:27,867
That brings us to--

3417
01:57:27,867 --> 01:57:29,387
TALIESIN: Damn.

3418
01:57:29,387 --> 01:57:30,387
MATT: Keyleth.

3419
01:57:30,387 --> 01:57:33,486
LAURA: Keyleth, don't look at them.

3420
01:57:33,486 --> 01:57:34,536
MARISHA: Okay.

3421
01:57:34,536 --> 01:57:36,898
MATT: Just as a note, your
inspiration dice that you give

3422
01:57:36,898 --> 01:57:39,517
can be used on saving throws as well.

3423
01:57:39,517 --> 01:57:40,892
SAM: Okay.

3424
01:57:40,892 --> 01:57:42,384
But I haven't given any.

3425
01:57:42,384 --> 01:57:43,217
MATT: No.

3426
01:57:44,597 --> 01:57:47,372
MARISHA: Um, I'm a bear right now.

3427
01:57:47,372 --> 01:57:51,539
MATT: You are a bear, which I
will, for the sake of this,

3428
01:57:52,037 --> 01:57:53,240
give you the kitty.

3429
01:57:53,240 --> 01:57:54,563
MARISHA: Bring out Minxie.

3430
01:57:54,563 --> 01:57:55,396
TRAVIS: Minxie.

3431
01:57:55,396 --> 01:57:58,244
MATT: Minxie is the form, 
but you are a bear.

3432
01:57:58,244 --> 01:58:02,077
MARISHA: Okay, first and foremost,
I'm gonna go ahead--

3433
01:58:03,853 --> 01:58:05,866
and I don't know if this is gonna help.

3434
01:58:05,866 --> 01:58:08,674
But I'm gonna throw up a fog cloud.

3435
01:58:08,674 --> 01:58:09,507
MATT: Okay.

3436
01:58:09,507 --> 01:58:10,340
MARISHA: Maybe.

3437
01:58:10,340 --> 01:58:11,173
MATT: Okay.

3438
01:58:11,173 --> 01:58:12,006
MARISHA: No?

3439
01:58:12,006 --> 01:58:12,839
MATT: So fog cloud.

3440
01:58:12,839 --> 01:58:14,542
The entire space, it's a 20 foot radius?

3441
01:58:14,542 --> 01:58:17,221
I believe, if I recall from
the one he did yesterday.

3442
01:58:17,221 --> 01:58:19,489
MARISHA: But it screws our vision,
though, doesn't it?

3443
01:58:19,489 --> 01:58:20,505
LAURA: Well, yeah.

3444
01:58:20,505 --> 01:58:21,991
MATT: Everybody gets obscured vision.

3445
01:58:21,991 --> 01:58:24,266
MARISHA: But I mean, we
wouldn't be able to see them.

3446
01:58:24,266 --> 01:58:25,852
Would it help with the
confusion is what I'm hoping.

3447
01:58:25,852 --> 01:58:27,787
LAURA: That could help, that could help.

3448
01:58:27,787 --> 01:58:29,259
SAM: Do your thing.
Do what you do.

3449
01:58:29,259 --> 01:58:30,382
MARISHA: Or would it be bad?

3450
01:58:30,382 --> 01:58:31,215
LAURA: Try it.

3451
01:58:31,215 --> 01:58:32,428
Do it, Keyleth, go with your instincts.

3452
01:58:32,428 --> 01:58:34,044
TALIESIN: Don't think about what's the worst
that could possibly happen.

3453
01:58:34,044 --> 01:58:35,913
MARISHA: I'm bursting out a fog cloud, and then--

3454
01:58:35,913 --> 01:58:37,046
MATT: Well to cast, you have to get out

3455
01:58:37,046 --> 01:58:39,440
of creature form, remember?

3456
01:58:39,440 --> 01:58:41,184
MARISHA: Oh, that's right.

3457
01:58:41,184 --> 01:58:43,020
I didn't throw a bow.

3458
01:58:43,020 --> 01:58:43,909
MATT: So you're a bear.

3459
01:58:43,909 --> 01:58:44,742
MARISHA: I'm a bear.

3460
01:58:44,742 --> 01:58:45,949
Nevermind, I'm just gonna
do a full round of attacks.

3461
01:58:45,949 --> 01:58:46,976
LIAM: It's go time, go time! (claps)

3462
01:58:46,976 --> 01:58:48,099
MARISHA: That one right there.

3463
01:58:48,099 --> 01:58:49,156
LAURA: Keep your eyes closed.

3464
01:58:49,156 --> 01:58:51,185
MATT: All right, so you move up to there.

3465
01:58:51,185 --> 01:58:52,663
Go ahead and do
your full round of attacks.

3466
01:58:52,663 --> 01:58:54,363
MATT: I am doing multi-attack.

3467
01:58:54,363 --> 01:58:56,753
MATT: Okay, are you averting 
your gaze or not?

3468
01:58:56,753 --> 01:58:58,601
MARISHA: I'm a cave bear, I'm blind.

3469
01:58:58,601 --> 01:59:00,740
I'm like a blind fish.

3470
01:59:00,740 --> 01:59:03,459
I have darkvision and, like, cataracts.

3471
01:59:03,459 --> 01:59:05,708
MATT: Darkvision means you 
can see in the dark.

3472
01:59:05,708 --> 01:59:08,098
MATT: But it doesn't mean 
that you don't see.

3473
01:59:08,098 --> 01:59:09,102
(Sam laughs)

3474
01:59:09,102 --> 01:59:10,355
MARISHA: Well I'm a bear.

3475
01:59:10,355 --> 01:59:11,468
MATT: You are a bear.

3476
01:59:11,468 --> 01:59:12,678
I'm eating at his leg.

3477
01:59:12,678 --> 01:59:14,153
I'm not looking at his eyes.

3478
01:59:14,153 --> 01:59:17,775
I'm not, like, waxing
poetically at how sexy he is.

3479
01:59:17,775 --> 01:59:18,608
MATT: No.

3480
01:59:18,608 --> 01:59:20,130
MARISHA: Not whispering sweet nothings
in his ear.

3481
01:59:20,130 --> 01:59:20,963
MATT: I know.

3482
01:59:20,963 --> 01:59:21,797
MARISHA: I'm gnawing at his leg.

3483
01:59:21,797 --> 01:59:22,770
MATT: That's true.

3484
01:59:22,770 --> 01:59:23,783
LIAM: Go for the kill!

3485
01:59:23,783 --> 01:59:25,442
MATT: Make a charisma saving throw.

3486
01:59:25,442 --> 01:59:27,082
MARISHA: Make a charisma saving throw?

3487
01:59:27,082 --> 01:59:27,915
MATT: Yes.

3488
01:59:27,915 --> 01:59:28,779
(Travis laughs)

3489
01:59:28,779 --> 01:59:30,617
LAURA: Next time just avert your gaze.

3490
01:59:30,617 --> 01:59:31,878
[Taliesin And Marisha] Oh!

3491
01:59:31,878 --> 01:59:32,962
MARISHA: That's good.

3492
01:59:32,962 --> 01:59:33,795
16.

3493
01:59:33,795 --> 01:59:34,628
MATT: 16?

3494
01:59:34,628 --> 01:59:37,358
You can feel the oppression
of the umber hulk's gaze,

3495
01:59:37,358 --> 01:59:39,711
but you shrug it off, your
bear mind not affected

3496
01:59:39,711 --> 01:59:41,836
by the measly tricks and traits--

3497
01:59:41,836 --> 01:59:43,129
MARISHA: Urgh, I'm a bear!

3498
01:59:43,129 --> 01:59:45,168
MATT: -of these strange underground entities.

3499
01:59:45,168 --> 01:59:46,001
MARISHA: Okay.

3500
01:59:46,001 --> 01:59:47,001
Now I'm attacking.

3501
01:59:47,001 --> 01:59:48,410
MATT: Roll for your four attacks.

3502
01:59:48,410 --> 01:59:52,008
MARISHA: First one probably misses.

3503
01:59:52,008 --> 01:59:53,425
With my claw, 14.

3504
01:59:54,810 --> 01:59:55,810
MATT: 14 misses.

3505
01:59:58,639 --> 01:59:59,639
(group laughs)

3506
01:59:59,639 --> 02:00:00,649
ORION: She got a pizza.

3507
02:00:00,649 --> 02:00:03,309
MARISHA: With the claw attacks, do
I have two claw attacks,

3508
02:00:03,309 --> 02:00:04,447
do I roll for both?

3509
02:00:04,447 --> 02:00:05,628
MATT: Yeah.

3510
02:00:05,628 --> 02:00:08,211
MARISHA: Okay, so the first one is 19,

3511
02:00:10,229 --> 02:00:11,062
MATT: Hits.

3512
02:00:11,062 --> 02:00:14,312
MARISHA: Second one, second claw attack is 18.

3513
02:00:15,911 --> 02:00:16,744
MATT: Also hits.

3514
02:00:16,744 --> 02:00:17,577
MARISHA: Okay.

3515
02:00:17,577 --> 02:00:20,410
So I am doing 2d6 plus five twice.

3516
02:00:23,950 --> 02:00:24,867
So six plus--

3517
02:00:26,385 --> 02:00:27,408
TALIESIN: It's 11.

3518
02:00:27,408 --> 02:00:28,575
MARISHA: Five, so 11.

3519
02:00:29,413 --> 02:00:30,246
TALIESIN: Ooh.

3520
02:00:30,246 --> 02:00:31,269
MARISHA: Plus 17--

3521
02:00:33,093 --> 02:00:34,443
20 damage.

3522
02:00:34,443 --> 02:00:35,736
MATT: 20 damage. Nice.

3523
02:00:36,109 --> 02:00:37,125
TALIESIN: 25.

3524
02:00:37,125 --> 02:00:38,112
MARISHA: Oh, 25.

3525
02:00:38,112 --> 02:00:38,945
Sorry, 25.

3526
02:00:38,948 --> 02:00:39,941
MATT: All righty.

3527
02:00:39,941 --> 02:00:41,107
TALIESIN: Yes.

3528
02:00:41,107 --> 02:00:42,160
MARISHA: 25 damage.

3529
02:00:42,160 --> 02:00:45,001
MATT: So, as you shake off the
effect, you reach for it,

3530
02:00:45,001 --> 02:00:47,010
lashing out, two large strikes.

3531
02:00:47,010 --> 02:00:49,379
The second one gets a
distinct carve into the back

3532
02:00:49,379 --> 02:00:50,559
of the umber hulk's hide.

3533
02:00:50,559 --> 02:00:52,909
You can see a portion of
its chitinous back armor

3534
02:00:52,909 --> 02:00:54,820
gets kind of pulled off in a chunk.

3535
02:00:54,820 --> 02:00:57,324
And it (snarls), reels
back from the impact

3536
02:00:57,324 --> 02:00:59,054
and readies itself for a
second round of attacks.

3537
02:00:59,054 --> 02:01:00,374
MARISHA: Me and Trinket.

3538
02:01:00,374 --> 02:01:01,397
MATT: There you go.

3539
02:01:01,397 --> 02:01:02,560
MARISHA: Going at this.

3540
02:01:02,560 --> 02:01:03,393
(Matt laughs)

3541
02:01:03,393 --> 02:01:05,244
MARISHA: Bear style.

3542
02:01:05,244 --> 02:01:06,077
MATT: They go.

3543
02:01:07,057 --> 02:01:10,931
This one turns towards and
moves this way to focus

3544
02:01:10,931 --> 02:01:13,718
on the cave bear that just
thrashed against its hide.

3545
02:01:13,718 --> 02:01:17,635
While this one turns and
moves in towards Grog.

3546
02:01:19,319 --> 02:01:21,441
But now turns and sees the-- actually no.

3547
02:01:21,441 --> 02:01:23,579
It stays there, fixed to Grog.

3548
02:01:23,579 --> 02:01:27,496
So making its multi-strike
against you, Keyleth.

3549
02:01:28,584 --> 02:01:30,796
That is a 26 to hit.

3550
02:01:30,796 --> 02:01:31,662
MARISHA: Hits.

3551
02:01:31,662 --> 02:01:33,489
MATT: That's mandibles.

3552
02:01:33,489 --> 02:01:34,959
17 to hit with its claw.

3553
02:01:34,959 --> 02:01:36,450
MARISHA: Hits.

3554
02:01:36,450 --> 02:01:38,600
MATT: And 18 to hit with its claw.

3555
02:01:38,600 --> 02:01:39,433
MARISHA: Hits.

3556
02:01:39,433 --> 02:01:42,208
MATT: All right, so you take six
points of slashing damage

3557
02:01:42,208 --> 02:01:43,875
from the first claw.

3558
02:01:44,740 --> 02:01:47,462
Eight points of slashing
damage from the second claw.

3559
02:01:47,462 --> 02:01:49,928
And then the mandibles deal fifteen points

3560
02:01:49,928 --> 02:01:53,105
of slashing damage, as the
umber hulk just turns to you,

3561
02:01:53,105 --> 02:01:55,275
and as a reaction to your assault--

3562
02:01:55,275 --> 02:01:56,643
MARISHA: What was the last one?

3563
02:01:56,643 --> 02:01:58,929
MATT: The last one was 15.

3564
02:01:58,929 --> 02:02:01,513
Just unleashes an array
of strikes against you.

3565
02:02:01,513 --> 02:02:03,061
(Matt growls)

3566
02:02:03,061 --> 02:02:04,857
LIAM: Hit it in the face.

3567
02:02:04,857 --> 02:02:07,922
MATT: That brings us to the other
one who's attacking you, Grog.

3568
02:02:07,922 --> 02:02:09,174
MARISHA: Back at him, yeah.

3569
02:02:09,174 --> 02:02:11,361
MATT: That is a 12 to hit.
Pretty sure misses.

3570
02:02:11,361 --> 02:02:12,349
TRAVIS: Misses.

3571
02:02:12,349 --> 02:02:15,814
MATT: Another 12 to hit, 
'cause it likes to roll fours, apparently.

3572
02:02:15,814 --> 02:02:17,467
TRAVIS: Give me another four.

3573
02:02:17,467 --> 02:02:18,897
MATT: For the mandibles, it's a 20.

3574
02:02:18,897 --> 02:02:19,724
TRAVIS: 20 hits.

3575
02:02:19,724 --> 02:02:22,229
MATT: You're taking damage, fool.

3576
02:02:22,229 --> 02:02:25,838
That is 18 points of
slashing damage against you.

3577
02:02:25,838 --> 02:02:27,999
TRAVIS: I have a half damage to
all bludgeoning, piercing,

3578
02:02:27,999 --> 02:02:28,900
and slashing damage?

3579
02:02:28,900 --> 02:02:29,733
MATT: You haven't raged yet.

3580
02:02:29,733 --> 02:02:30,714
TRAVIS: So I'm not raging?!

3581
02:02:30,714 --> 02:02:31,547
MATT: You haven't raged yet!

3582
02:02:31,547 --> 02:02:32,501
It isn't your turn yet.

3583
02:02:32,501 --> 02:02:33,486
TRAVIS: But I'm so angry.

3584
02:02:33,486 --> 02:02:34,319
MATT: I know.

3585
02:02:34,319 --> 02:02:35,774
You're about to be so angry.

3586
02:02:35,774 --> 02:02:36,717
TRAVIS: 18 points.

3587
02:02:36,717 --> 02:02:38,154
MATT: You're gonna be so angry.

3588
02:02:38,154 --> 02:02:39,752
18 points of slashing damage.

3589
02:02:39,752 --> 02:02:42,157
The mandibles crush down on your body,

3590
02:02:42,157 --> 02:02:44,027
and you can feel them
pierce into your chest.

3591
02:02:44,027 --> 02:02:47,049
Your exposed musculature is
then torn in a jagged form

3592
02:02:47,049 --> 02:02:49,567
as you feel the blood begin
to pour down the front

3593
02:02:49,567 --> 02:02:50,380
of your torso.

3594
02:02:50,380 --> 02:02:51,313
TRAVIS: It's all right, it's okay.

3595
02:02:51,313 --> 02:02:52,198
LAURA: That's brutal.

3596
02:02:52,198 --> 02:02:54,165
TRAVIS: My turn's coming.
MATT: That ends their turn.

3597
02:02:54,165 --> 02:02:55,220
Vax.

3598
02:02:55,220 --> 02:02:56,475
LIAM: So I can see what's up.

3599
02:02:56,475 --> 02:02:58,750
I saw what it did to my sister,

3600
02:02:58,750 --> 02:03:00,374
so I'm gonna jump on its back.

3601
02:03:00,374 --> 02:03:02,134
I'm gonna swivel my daggers around

3602
02:03:02,134 --> 02:03:03,584
and just stab it in the face.

3603
02:03:03,584 --> 02:03:05,029
LAURA: But keep your gaze averted.

3604
02:03:05,029 --> 02:03:07,808
LIAM: Yeah, I'm seeing the
back of his fucking spine or head.

3605
02:03:07,808 --> 02:03:09,481
I'm gonna stab
him in the face twice.

3606
02:03:09,481 --> 02:03:10,314
MATT: Go for it.

3607
02:03:10,314 --> 02:03:11,266
LIAM: Okay.

3608
02:03:11,266 --> 02:03:12,715
LIAM: Nine--

3609
02:03:14,107 --> 02:03:15,686
20.

3610
02:03:15,686 --> 02:03:16,519
MATT: That hits.

3611
02:03:16,519 --> 02:03:17,352
LIAM: Okay.

3612
02:03:17,352 --> 02:03:18,585
So then I'll do damage.

3613
02:03:18,585 --> 02:03:20,078
The other one's an 18.

3614
02:03:20,078 --> 02:03:21,329
I rolled in advance.

3615
02:03:21,329 --> 02:03:22,952
LAURA: That counts, that counts!

3616
02:03:22,952 --> 02:03:24,728
MATT: That one, that's the one!

3617
02:03:24,728 --> 02:03:28,222
LIAM: So, 10, plus sneak attack damage, right?

3618
02:03:28,222 --> 02:03:29,055
MATT: Yeah.

3619
02:03:29,055 --> 02:03:29,888
LIAM: Yeah, okay.

3620
02:03:29,888 --> 02:03:32,834
MATT: He doesn't know you were
there, you were stealthed.

3621
02:03:32,834 --> 02:03:33,586
LIAM: Okay.

3622
02:03:33,586 --> 02:03:34,490
One. Four.

3623
02:03:35,344 --> 02:03:36,526
Eight.

3624
02:03:36,526 --> 02:03:37,359
Nine.

3625
02:03:38,325 --> 02:03:41,985
13, 26, 36 damage from the first dagger.

3626
02:03:41,985 --> 02:03:42,801
MARISHA: Whoo!

3627
02:03:42,801 --> 02:03:44,729
LIAM: Face, in his face, 
and the next was an 18.

3628
02:03:44,729 --> 02:03:45,962
MATT: Not in his face.

3629
02:03:45,962 --> 02:03:46,970
Not in his face.

3630
02:03:46,970 --> 02:03:47,833
LIAM: Not in his face?

3631
02:03:47,833 --> 02:03:49,388
MATT: It's back.

3632
02:03:49,388 --> 02:03:51,216
LIAM: But I wanted I wanted
to do this to his head.

3633
02:03:51,216 --> 02:03:52,065
Okay, whatever works.

3634
02:03:52,065 --> 02:03:53,666
TRAVIS: The reach around?

3635
02:03:53,666 --> 02:03:55,309
ORION: The old reach around stabbing.

3636
02:03:55,309 --> 02:03:57,230
LIAM: The reach around, the reach around.

3637
02:03:57,230 --> 02:03:58,513
That what I was going for.

3638
02:03:58,513 --> 02:04:01,263
And then, where's my four, 1d4.

3639
02:04:03,835 --> 02:04:06,289
One's a three, but no, just three.

3640
02:04:06,289 --> 02:04:07,122
MATT: Three, okay.

3641
02:04:07,122 --> 02:04:08,834
LIAM: With my flametongue dagger

3642
02:04:08,834 --> 02:04:10,427
which I don't know if
he likes or dislikes,

3643
02:04:10,427 --> 02:04:11,372
but that's what I've done.

3644
02:04:11,372 --> 02:04:14,226
MATT: Okay, so, as you leap on its
back, grab purchase

3645
02:04:14,226 --> 02:04:16,796
on one of its chitinous
plates, bring your first dagger

3646
02:04:16,796 --> 02:04:19,037
forward and jam it into
the side of its head,

3647
02:04:19,037 --> 02:04:21,098
as it pulls back, you hear a (snarling)

3648
02:04:21,098 --> 02:04:22,369
as it reacts to the immediate pain

3649
02:04:22,369 --> 02:04:24,421
and begins to
reach one of its claws

3650
02:04:24,421 --> 02:04:25,800
to try and knock you off.

3651
02:04:25,800 --> 02:04:28,413
As you do, you put the
blade back into your belt,

3652
02:04:28,413 --> 02:04:30,017
grab with your other hand,
pull your other dagger,

3653
02:04:30,017 --> 02:04:31,843
and slam it into the
other side of its head.

3654
02:04:31,843 --> 02:04:32,676
TRAVIS: Yeah!

3655
02:04:32,676 --> 02:04:34,409
MATT: This time it shrugs you off,

3656
02:04:34,409 --> 02:04:36,860
and you manage to just
land on your feet barely,

3657
02:04:36,860 --> 02:04:39,141
behind it, still faced away from you.

3658
02:04:39,141 --> 02:04:41,026
That brings us to Grog.

3659
02:04:41,026 --> 02:04:41,859
(Travis grunts)

3660
02:04:41,859 --> 02:04:42,692
Rage.

3661
02:04:42,692 --> 02:04:43,525
MARISHA: Rage!

3662
02:04:43,525 --> 02:04:44,472
TRAVIS: Now I'm angry.

3663
02:04:44,472 --> 02:04:45,305
MATT: Okay.

3664
02:04:45,305 --> 02:04:48,057
TRAVIS: I would like to rage, 
and not only rage,

3665
02:04:48,057 --> 02:04:50,726
I would like to go into a frenzied rage.

3666
02:04:50,726 --> 02:04:51,559
MATT: Okay.

3667
02:04:51,559 --> 02:04:53,558
TRAVIS: For three full attacks.

3668
02:04:53,558 --> 02:04:54,391
MATT: All right.

3669
02:04:54,391 --> 02:04:58,866
TRAVIS: While I'm raging so hard,
that I pop all the capillaries

3670
02:04:58,866 --> 02:05:03,248
in my eyeballs, so I can't
really see that well.

3671
02:05:03,248 --> 02:05:05,519
And I just swing a lot.

3672
02:05:05,519 --> 02:05:07,185
MATT: All right, I'm gonna check
one thing real fast.

3673
02:05:07,185 --> 02:05:08,022
LAURA: Oh, no.

3674
02:05:08,022 --> 02:05:09,769
TRAVIS: Oh, shit! 
Don't check, look, I'm rolling.

3675
02:05:09,769 --> 02:05:10,886
(Marisha and Laura laugh)

3676
02:05:10,886 --> 02:05:11,734
30.

3677
02:05:11,734 --> 02:05:14,085
LIAM: There once was a bard from Nantucket.

3678
02:05:14,085 --> 02:05:16,569
(group laughs)

3679
02:05:16,569 --> 02:05:18,960
LIAM: Who got his flute caught--

3680
02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:20,206
TRAVIS: I gain one level of
exhaustion with a rage hit.

3681
02:05:20,206 --> 02:05:21,383
LIAM: --in a bucket.

3682
02:05:21,383 --> 02:05:23,992
MATT: I will say, situationally,
because of the fact

3683
02:05:23,992 --> 02:05:27,069
that your rage that you have
advantage on the saving throw

3684
02:05:27,069 --> 02:05:28,663
against the confusion effect.

3685
02:05:28,663 --> 02:05:29,806
[Marisha and Laura] Oh.

3686
02:05:29,806 --> 02:05:32,716
Your mind is so filled with aggression.

3687
02:05:32,716 --> 02:05:35,311
TRAVIS: I got that big, like, nasty thing.

3688
02:05:35,311 --> 02:05:37,502
MATT: So make charisma saving throw.

3689
02:05:37,502 --> 02:05:38,965
TALIESIN: Oh, what a good idea.

3690
02:05:38,965 --> 02:05:40,018
TRAVIS: Is that a 20?

3691
02:05:40,018 --> 02:05:41,055
MATT: Yep.

3692
02:05:41,055 --> 02:05:41,972
LAURA: Plus one.

3693
02:05:41,972 --> 02:05:43,058
TRAVIS: 11.

3694
02:05:43,058 --> 02:05:44,901
MATT: Roll again, you have advantage.

3695
02:05:45,522 --> 02:05:46,865
LIAM: Better, better, better, no.

3696
02:05:46,865 --> 02:05:47,698
TRAVIS: Five.

3697
02:05:47,698 --> 02:05:48,531
LAURA: Oh no!

3698
02:05:48,531 --> 02:05:50,009
MATT: Let's see what happens.

3699
02:05:50,009 --> 02:05:50,842
LAURA: No!

3700
02:05:52,120 --> 02:05:52,980
ORION: Roll a two.

3701
02:05:52,980 --> 02:05:53,933
MATT: So--

3702
02:05:53,933 --> 02:05:55,497
(group groans)

3703
02:05:55,497 --> 02:05:56,509
LAURA: Now he's raging, too.

3704
02:05:56,509 --> 02:05:57,676
MATT: --as you rage--

3705
02:05:58,847 --> 02:05:59,930
MARISHA: No, dammit.

3706
02:06:00,926 --> 02:06:05,009
MATT: --you feel the influence
of the umber hulk's gaze

3707
02:06:06,498 --> 02:06:09,582
pierce your eyes and the fury fills you,

3708
02:06:09,582 --> 02:06:13,082
and you reach out and slash with your axe.

3709
02:06:14,424 --> 02:06:18,257
However, it does not
reach for the umber hulk.

3710
02:06:19,238 --> 02:06:20,595
Go ahead and roll an attack, Grog.

3711
02:06:20,595 --> 02:06:22,867
LAURA: Oh no, who's he hitting?

3712
02:06:22,867 --> 02:06:23,784
TRAVIS: A one!

3713
02:06:23,784 --> 02:06:25,286
(group cheers)

3714
02:06:25,286 --> 02:06:26,119
SAM: Finally!

3715
02:06:27,751 --> 02:06:28,584
MARISHA: Yes!

3716
02:06:29,812 --> 02:06:33,733
MATT: There's a loud clanging
sound, as a giant, angry,

3717
02:06:33,733 --> 02:06:37,900
swooping bladed greataxe misses
Tiberius's head by inches.

3718
02:06:40,023 --> 02:06:40,949
ORION: Oh!

3719
02:06:40,949 --> 02:06:42,263
Grog, what are you doing?

3720
02:06:42,263 --> 02:06:45,690
MATT: Before slamming into the stone
right up against the side of the wall.

3721
02:06:45,690 --> 02:06:48,244
You can just see now this
kind of loose, crazed look

3722
02:06:48,244 --> 02:06:49,711
in his eye. (growls maniacally)

3723
02:06:49,711 --> 02:06:51,584
MATT: Foam begins to gather at
the side of his mouth.

3724
02:06:51,584 --> 02:06:52,913
ORION: Oh, now you're all screwed up.

3725
02:06:52,913 --> 02:06:54,558
LIAM: We have a problem.

3726
02:06:54,558 --> 02:06:55,711
LAURA: Yeah, this could be bad.

3727
02:06:55,711 --> 02:06:56,924
LIAM: We have an angry Grog.

3728
02:06:56,924 --> 02:06:58,047
MATT: Tiberius, you're up.

3729
02:06:58,047 --> 02:06:58,880
ORION: Damn it, Grog.

3730
02:06:58,880 --> 02:06:59,943
TRAVIS: It's my turn?

3731
02:06:59,943 --> 02:07:01,336
MATT: No, that's your turn.

3732
02:07:01,339 --> 02:07:02,682
TRAVIS: Oh, that's my turn.

3733
02:07:02,682 --> 02:07:03,878
MARISHA: Tiberius, help.

3734
02:07:03,878 --> 02:07:05,323
LAURA: At least your rolled a one.

3735
02:07:05,323 --> 02:07:06,152
TRAVIS: I did.

3736
02:07:06,152 --> 02:07:07,245
I didn't hurt anybody yet.

3737
02:07:07,245 --> 02:07:10,002
ORION: I look at Grog, and I'm
like, will you stop it!

3738
02:07:10,002 --> 02:07:11,524
I cast Dispel Magic on him.

3739
02:07:11,524 --> 02:07:13,047
(Travis snarls)

3740
02:07:13,047 --> 02:07:13,880
MATT: Cast Dispel Magic?

3741
02:07:13,880 --> 02:07:14,713
ORION: Yeah.

3742
02:07:14,713 --> 02:07:15,546
LAURA: On Grog?

3743
02:07:15,546 --> 02:07:16,379
MATT: Okay.

3744
02:07:16,379 --> 02:07:17,835
SAM: I don't think it's magic.

3745
02:07:17,835 --> 02:07:19,543
ORION: Yeah, he's being controlled by it.

3746
02:07:19,543 --> 02:07:20,556
TRAVIS: He can do whatever.

3747
02:07:20,556 --> 02:07:22,700
LIAM: It's more natural, 
it's creature-based.

3748
02:07:22,700 --> 02:07:24,206
TRAVIS: She's also being controlled.

3749
02:07:24,206 --> 02:07:26,550
ORION: I know, but you're a
big, hulking, crazy mofo.

3750
02:07:26,550 --> 02:07:28,339
MATT: No, it is a magical force.

3751
02:07:28,339 --> 02:07:29,745
ORION: Yes, it is.

3752
02:07:29,745 --> 02:07:31,428
MATT: Forced to make a save.

3753
02:07:31,428 --> 02:07:32,741
TRAVIS: Save me, save me.

3754
02:07:32,741 --> 02:07:34,718
MATT: Go head and make an arcana check.

3755
02:07:34,718 --> 02:07:38,604
(Sam and Laura sing along
with tense background music)

3756
02:07:38,604 --> 02:07:40,099
ORION: Uh, 17.

3757
02:07:40,099 --> 02:07:41,433
MATT: 17.

3758
02:07:41,433 --> 02:07:44,154
The chaotic influence in your
brain begins to dissipate,

3759
02:07:44,154 --> 02:07:45,932
and the rage-filled gaze begins

3760
02:07:45,932 --> 02:07:47,420
to fill your eyes once again,

3761
02:07:47,420 --> 02:07:49,619
this time clarifying on the
umber hulk in front of you.

3762
02:07:49,619 --> 02:07:50,962
LAURA: Thanks a lot, Tiberius.

3763
02:07:50,962 --> 02:07:51,795
SAM: Thank god.

3764
02:07:51,795 --> 02:07:53,074
ORION: I'm not done yet.

3765
02:07:53,074 --> 02:07:55,041
I slap him.
Just get on this, will you?

3766
02:07:55,041 --> 02:07:55,867
(Travis snarls)

3767
02:07:55,867 --> 02:07:57,898
ORION: I use two SP points to
do quickening spell.

3768
02:07:57,898 --> 02:08:01,470
I cast Grand Column under
myself. (imitates rock moving)

3769
02:08:01,470 --> 02:08:02,700
Fifteen feet up in the air.

3770
02:08:02,700 --> 02:08:03,750
MARISHA: Nice.

3771
02:08:03,750 --> 02:08:04,686
(Orion spits)

3772
02:08:04,686 --> 02:08:07,256
MATT: So, the stone beneath
Tiberius's feet rises up,

3773
02:08:07,256 --> 02:08:10,058
creating a column fifteen
feet above the rest.

3774
02:08:10,058 --> 02:08:13,277
He is now raised on a platform.

3775
02:08:13,277 --> 02:08:15,954
I'll put him right there.

3776
02:08:15,954 --> 02:08:17,741
Looking down upon the battlefield.

3777
02:08:17,741 --> 02:08:19,527
ORION: (clears throat) that is my turn.

3778
02:08:19,527 --> 02:08:20,879
MATT: All right, Vex, you're up.

3779
02:08:20,879 --> 02:08:22,661
LAURA: Oh, do I have to cast a saving throw

3780
02:08:22,661 --> 02:08:23,494
or am I fine?

3781
02:08:23,494 --> 02:08:24,553
LIAM: Be a badass, be a badass.

3782
02:08:24,553 --> 02:08:25,769
MATT: Are you looking at it, or
are you averting your gaze?

3783
02:08:25,769 --> 02:08:27,848
LAURA: No, I'm averting my gaze even though

3784
02:08:27,848 --> 02:08:29,228
I'm confused apparently.

3785
02:08:29,228 --> 02:08:31,051
MATT: Well, the confusion only lasts one turn.

3786
02:08:31,051 --> 02:08:32,288
LAURA: Okay, good.

3787
02:08:32,288 --> 02:08:33,121
I am not.

3788
02:08:33,774 --> 02:08:35,585
What's that thingy behind me?

3789
02:08:35,585 --> 02:08:36,648
MARISHA: Oh, we've got these.

3790
02:08:36,648 --> 02:08:37,686
MATT: This here?

3791
02:08:37,686 --> 02:08:38,519
LAURA: No.

3792
02:08:38,519 --> 02:08:39,352
MATT: This here?

3793
02:08:39,352 --> 02:08:40,185
LAURA: Yeah, what's that?

3794
02:08:40,185 --> 02:08:41,018
MATT: This is rock.

3795
02:08:41,018 --> 02:08:42,001
LAURA: How high is it?

3796
02:08:42,001 --> 02:08:43,751
MATT: This is about 25, 30 feet up.

3797
02:08:43,751 --> 02:08:45,314
TRAVIS: Use your laser pointer, dude.

3798
02:08:45,314 --> 02:08:46,577
MATT: And this is where the light
source is coming from.

3799
02:08:46,577 --> 02:08:47,902
You can't look over that way.

3800
02:08:47,902 --> 02:08:49,825
LAURA: All, right cool. 
I avert my gaze

3801
02:08:49,825 --> 02:08:52,455
but I listen very carefully to the sound

3802
02:08:52,455 --> 02:08:54,002
of where it's coming from.

3803
02:08:54,002 --> 02:08:54,835
(Taliesin whistles)

3804
02:08:54,835 --> 02:08:56,862
LAURA: And I shoot in that direction.

3805
02:08:56,862 --> 02:08:57,695
MATT: Okay.

3806
02:08:57,695 --> 02:08:58,528
(Taliesin and Marisha imitate birds)

3807
02:08:58,528 --> 02:08:59,858
MATT: So go ahead and make your
attacks against this fellow.

3808
02:08:59,858 --> 02:09:01,504
TRAVIS: That's some Hawkeye stuff.

3809
02:09:01,504 --> 02:09:02,899
MATT: You shooting this one?

3810
02:09:02,899 --> 02:09:04,967
LAURA: Let's do the one that is surrounded

3811
02:09:04,967 --> 02:09:07,309
so I get like, what,
flanking bonus or something.

3812
02:09:07,309 --> 02:09:09,317
MATT: For ranged, you would not get a bonus

3813
02:09:09,317 --> 02:09:10,490
for that unfortunately.

3814
02:09:10,490 --> 02:09:11,743
LAURA: Lame. All right.

3815
02:09:11,743 --> 02:09:13,798
MATT: So are you shooting 
at the one behind you?

3816
02:09:13,798 --> 02:09:14,624
This one?

3817
02:09:14,624 --> 02:09:15,457
LAURA: Sure.

3818
02:09:15,457 --> 02:09:16,283
Okay.

3819
02:09:16,283 --> 02:09:17,956
LAURA: No, no, no, no, the other one.

3820
02:09:17,956 --> 02:09:18,789
MATT: Okay, all right.

3821
02:09:18,789 --> 02:09:20,206
So, make your attacks with a disadvantage,

3822
02:09:20,206 --> 02:09:21,602
as you're kind of keeping your eyes back

3823
02:09:21,602 --> 02:09:24,016
and shooting in its general direction.

3824
02:09:24,016 --> 02:09:26,202
MARISHA: Big money, no whammies.

3825
02:09:26,202 --> 02:09:27,729
LAURA: 12, both of them were 12.

3826
02:09:28,372 --> 02:09:29,210
But plus 11.

3827
02:09:29,210 --> 02:09:30,233
MATT: Plus, eleven?

3828
02:09:30,233 --> 02:09:31,066
Hits.

3829
02:09:31,066 --> 02:09:31,899
LAURA: Yes!

3830
02:09:31,899 --> 02:09:33,629
Oh, and I get two attacks, right?

3831
02:09:33,629 --> 02:09:34,633
MATT: You do, yes.

3832
02:09:34,633 --> 02:09:35,466
LAURA: Okay.

3833
02:09:37,285 --> 02:09:38,118
Still disadvantage?

3834
02:09:38,118 --> 02:09:39,598
MATT: Yep.

3835
02:09:39,598 --> 02:09:41,539
LAURA: 15 plus 11, hits.

3836
02:09:41,539 --> 02:09:42,838
MATT: That also hits, yeah.

3837
02:09:42,838 --> 02:09:43,996
So both attacks hit.

3838
02:09:43,996 --> 02:09:44,901
LAURA: Yes!

3839
02:09:44,901 --> 02:09:46,582
MATT: Did you want to use your
bonus action for anything?

3840
02:09:46,582 --> 02:09:48,481
LAURA: Oh yes, Hunter's Mark.

3841
02:09:48,481 --> 02:09:49,355
MATT: All right, so you throw Hunter's Mark

3842
02:09:49,355 --> 02:09:50,731
on this umber hulk there.

3843
02:09:50,731 --> 02:09:52,294
LAURA: Yes, I do.

3844
02:09:52,294 --> 02:09:55,201
MATT: But you're like, you're my quarry, ugh.

3845
02:09:55,201 --> 02:09:56,420
Keeping your eyes back.

3846
02:09:56,420 --> 02:09:58,125
You go ahead and pull your
first and second arrow,

3847
02:09:58,125 --> 02:09:59,657
(imitates bow firing
arrows), letting them loose,

3848
02:09:59,657 --> 02:10:01,476
kind of letting a little bit of faith

3849
02:10:01,476 --> 02:10:02,629
take your arrows to the wind.

3850
02:10:02,629 --> 02:10:04,640
Both finding purchase on your foe.

3851
02:10:04,640 --> 02:10:06,251
LAURA: Can I use bloodseeking bow on that one?

3852
02:10:06,251 --> 02:10:07,084
MATT: You can, yes.

3853
02:10:07,084 --> 02:10:08,304
LAURA: Sweet.

3854
02:10:08,304 --> 02:10:09,471
All right, cool.

3855
02:10:10,561 --> 02:10:12,311
So that's 15, no, 11.

3856
02:10:15,652 --> 02:10:17,233
And then 15.

3857
02:10:17,233 --> 02:10:18,134
(group laughs)

3858
02:10:18,134 --> 02:10:19,447
LAURA: It was good so I kept it.

3859
02:10:19,447 --> 02:10:20,820
TRAVIS: She dropped it, 
but it was a good roll.

3860
02:10:20,820 --> 02:10:22,237
ORION: Yeah, take the drop.

3861
02:10:22,237 --> 02:10:24,963
LAURA: Plus bloodseeking, which is 10 damage,

3862
02:10:24,963 --> 02:10:28,588
plus Hunter's Mark, which
is a six, which is 3.

3863
02:10:28,588 --> 02:10:29,588
MATT: So total damage of...?

3864
02:10:29,588 --> 02:10:31,242
LAURA: Oh, I have to add.

3865
02:10:31,902 --> 02:10:33,028
(Matt laughs)

3866
02:10:33,028 --> 02:10:34,528
LAURA: 15 plus 11 plus 3.

3867
02:10:35,831 --> 02:10:37,933
26, 29 damage.

3868
02:10:37,933 --> 02:10:38,766
MARISHA: Woo!

3869
02:10:38,766 --> 02:10:39,599
MATT: Nice!

3870
02:10:39,599 --> 02:10:40,836
(Liam imitates arrows firing)

3871
02:10:40,836 --> 02:10:42,755
MATT: So, as your arrows sink into him,

3872
02:10:42,755 --> 02:10:44,125
one blasts into him.

3873
02:10:44,125 --> 02:10:46,097
Fire cascades up the side,
you can see the middle

3874
02:10:46,097 --> 02:10:47,863
of its plates beginning to burn

3875
02:10:47,863 --> 02:10:50,280
and torch the cinderous glow.

3876
02:10:50,820 --> 02:10:53,820
It reels back, gets its claws ready,

3877
02:10:54,821 --> 02:10:56,225
now fixated on you 'cause you

3878
02:10:56,225 --> 02:10:57,582
just announced your presence to it.

3879
02:10:57,582 --> 02:10:58,899
LAURA: I'm looking again, so.

3880
02:10:58,899 --> 02:11:00,157
MATT: All right.

3881
02:11:00,157 --> 02:11:02,599
Anything you wanna do with...?

3882
02:11:02,599 --> 02:11:03,432
LAURA: Trinket?

3883
02:11:03,432 --> 02:11:04,265
MATT: Trinket.

3884
02:11:04,265 --> 02:11:05,232
LAURA: Oh, yeah.

3885
02:11:05,232 --> 02:11:07,444
Can he run up and attack the other one?

3886
02:11:07,444 --> 02:11:08,885
While keeping his eyes down?

3887
02:11:08,885 --> 02:11:11,041
MATT: He would have to use one
of your attacks to do that.

3888
02:11:11,041 --> 02:11:13,386
LAURA: Oh okay, well then he's just
hanging out.

3889
02:11:13,386 --> 02:11:14,729
MATT: Trinket's just hanging out.

3890
02:11:14,729 --> 02:11:15,978
LAURA: He's protecting Scanlan.

3891
02:11:15,978 --> 02:11:17,111
(Matt imitates bear growling)

3892
02:11:17,111 --> 02:11:18,384
Yeah, big old bear protecting your gnome.

3893
02:11:18,384 --> 02:11:19,730
LAURA: Protect the gnome!

3894
02:11:19,730 --> 02:11:20,563
LIAM: Gnome coverage.

3895
02:11:20,563 --> 02:11:21,576
[Marisha And Taliesin] Gnome coverage.

3896
02:11:21,579 --> 02:11:23,462
MATT: No healer this week.
What could possibly go wrong?

3897
02:11:23,462 --> 02:11:24,711
MARISHA: Gnomewatch 2015.

3898
02:11:24,711 --> 02:11:25,972
MATT: Scanlan, you're up.

3899
02:11:25,972 --> 02:11:27,550
SAM: Scanlan.

3900
02:11:27,550 --> 02:11:29,048
LIAM: Ride the bear, Scanlan.

3901
02:11:29,048 --> 02:11:30,245
SAM: Ride the bear.

3902
02:11:30,245 --> 02:11:31,699
TRAVIS: Oh my God.

3903
02:11:31,699 --> 02:11:35,004
SAM: I will just step forward a little,

3904
02:11:35,004 --> 02:11:38,587
and I will cast polymorph
on our big friend

3905
02:11:38,587 --> 02:11:40,385
that we're surrounding.

3906
02:11:41,280 --> 02:11:44,404
And I'll turn him into a snail.

3907
02:11:44,404 --> 02:11:45,460
MARISHA: A snail? Aww!

3908
02:11:45,460 --> 02:11:46,293
MATT: All right.

3909
02:11:46,293 --> 02:11:47,586
TRAVIS: Can you do that?!

3910
02:11:47,586 --> 02:11:48,419
SAM: Yes.

3911
02:11:48,792 --> 02:11:51,337
MATT: What's the DC, the difficulty
class on your spells?

3912
02:11:51,337 --> 02:11:54,319
SAM: Through the horn of clarity or whatever.

3913
02:11:54,319 --> 02:11:55,291
So it's 17.

3914
02:11:55,291 --> 02:11:56,379
MATT: 17, alright.

3915
02:11:56,379 --> 02:11:58,427
SAM: Or no, 19, sorry, 19.

3916
02:11:58,427 --> 02:11:59,260
MATT: 19.

3917
02:11:59,260 --> 02:12:00,506
SAM: It's plus two.

3918
02:12:00,506 --> 02:12:02,722
MATT: So, as the two umber hulks are there,

3919
02:12:02,722 --> 02:12:05,419
the one that's in the center
of the group, (snarls).

3920
02:12:05,419 --> 02:12:06,615
LAURA: Oh, Tiberius.

3921
02:12:06,615 --> 02:12:08,934
LAURA: Rears back, beginning to
unleash its series of attacks,

3922
02:12:08,934 --> 02:12:10,486
and then (sharp hiss),

3923
02:12:10,486 --> 02:12:11,405
into this tiny--

3924
02:12:11,405 --> 02:12:12,548
TRAVIS: What?!

3925
02:12:12,548 --> 02:12:14,255
MATT: --snail form on the ground.

3926
02:12:14,255 --> 02:12:15,081
LAURA: Awesome!

3927
02:12:15,081 --> 02:12:16,641
LIAM: Don't touch the snail until the--

3928
02:12:16,641 --> 02:12:17,474
LAURA: Why?

3929
02:12:17,474 --> 02:12:20,127
LIAM: 'Cause he'll poof out into
the fucking big guy again.

3930
02:12:20,127 --> 02:12:20,960
SAM: Don't hurt the snail.

3931
02:12:20,960 --> 02:12:21,966
LIAM: Leave it, leave it.

3932
02:12:21,966 --> 02:12:23,965
SAM: Don't pick up the snail.
Just be nice to the snail.

3933
02:12:23,965 --> 02:12:25,594
LIAM: Leave it alone.
Hit the other one.

3934
02:12:25,594 --> 02:12:27,357
ORION: Don't do anything.
I'll take care of the snail.

3935
02:12:27,357 --> 02:12:28,610
(talking over each other)

3936
02:12:28,610 --> 02:12:31,043
MATT: There's a tiny, tiny little
snail on the ground now

3937
02:12:31,043 --> 02:12:32,701
that looks very confused.

3938
02:12:32,701 --> 02:12:33,950
LAURA: That's confusing.

3939
02:12:33,950 --> 02:12:36,617
MATT: Very confused, which is
ironic for an umber hulk,

3940
02:12:36,617 --> 02:12:37,786
to feel confused.

3941
02:12:37,786 --> 02:12:39,503
SAM: As a bonus action,
I give dice to--

3942
02:12:39,503 --> 02:12:42,307
who's coming up next?
Who's coming up soon?

3943
02:12:42,307 --> 02:12:43,808
MATT: Next'll be Percy.

3944
02:12:43,808 --> 02:12:45,585
SAM: Percy, you get dice.

3945
02:12:45,585 --> 02:12:47,122
TALIESIN: What dice do I get?

3946
02:12:47,122 --> 02:12:47,955
MATT: d8.

3947
02:12:47,955 --> 02:12:49,291
SAM: A d8 for inspiration.

3948
02:12:49,291 --> 02:12:51,057
TALIESIN: A d8? All right. Excellent.

3949
02:12:51,057 --> 02:12:51,890
MATT: Percy, you're up.

3950
02:12:51,890 --> 02:12:53,726
(Sam imitates flutes)
Gotta do my app.

3951
02:12:53,726 --> 02:12:55,243
MATT: Do your app, fuck it up.

3952
02:12:55,243 --> 02:12:56,374
ORION: Do the app.

3953
02:12:56,374 --> 02:12:57,517
SAM: No, it's not ready.

3954
02:12:57,517 --> 02:12:58,640
(group laughs)

3955
02:12:58,640 --> 02:13:01,703
TALIESIN: I'm gonna take one of my
two actions to clear my gun.

3956
02:13:01,703 --> 02:13:02,703
TRAVIS: Yeah, the jam.

3957
02:13:02,703 --> 02:13:03,676
TALIESIN: Clear the jam.

3958
02:13:03,676 --> 02:13:04,909
And then set up for a fire shot.

3959
02:13:04,909 --> 02:13:06,440
And I'm gonna take a fire shot.

3960
02:13:06,440 --> 02:13:08,121
Am I at a disadvantage?

3961
02:13:08,121 --> 02:13:11,493
(tinny electronic music)

3962
02:13:11,493 --> 02:13:12,577
MATT: You're inspired.

3963
02:13:12,577 --> 02:13:14,038
SAM: It's so weak, it's so weak.

3964
02:13:14,038 --> 02:13:15,089
TRAVIS: You've gotta get it better.

3965
02:13:15,089 --> 02:13:16,223
MATT: So, who are you shooting?

3966
02:13:16,223 --> 02:13:18,543
TALIESIN: I'm shooting our friend over there.

3967
02:13:18,543 --> 02:13:20,827
I've just sort of turned, and I'm firing.

3968
02:13:20,827 --> 02:13:22,670
TALIESIN: So am I at a disadvantage?

3969
02:13:22,670 --> 02:13:23,951
MATT: Averting your gaze?

3970
02:13:23,951 --> 02:13:27,418
TALIESIN: I'm averting my gaze, but
I know where it is.

3971
02:13:27,418 --> 02:13:30,051
MATT: Right. So go ahead 
and fire at disadvantage.

3972
02:13:30,051 --> 02:13:32,074
SAM: You got the dice, you got the dice.

3973
02:13:32,074 --> 02:13:33,129
TALIESIN: Okay.

3974
02:13:38,411 --> 02:13:40,644
14 with the disadvantage.

3975
02:13:40,644 --> 02:13:43,507
MATT: 14 with the disadvantage
will miss, unfortunately.

3976
02:13:43,507 --> 02:13:44,496
(imitates gun firing)

3977
02:13:44,496 --> 02:13:46,467
The fire shot arcs off into the distance--

3978
02:13:46,467 --> 02:13:47,810
TALIESIN: Oh oh, actually--

3979
02:13:47,810 --> 02:13:49,399
MARISHA: Oh yeah, inspiration.

3980
02:13:49,399 --> 02:13:51,483
MATT: Add the inspiration dice.

3981
02:13:51,483 --> 02:13:52,382
TALIESIN: 17.

3982
02:13:52,382 --> 02:13:53,714
MATT: 17 will just barely hit.

3983
02:13:53,714 --> 02:13:56,043
(group cheers)

3984
02:13:56,043 --> 02:13:58,659
TALIESIN: Well done, well done, ha ha!

3985
02:13:58,659 --> 02:13:59,492
ORION: Good shot!

3986
02:13:59,492 --> 02:14:00,748
LIAM: Good stunt work, Tiberius.

3987
02:14:00,748 --> 02:14:04,128
TALIESIN: So, that's gonna do--
ba-bumpa-bum.

3988
02:14:04,128 --> 02:14:06,893
ORION: I have to wait to figure
out when to open which one.

3989
02:14:06,893 --> 02:14:11,553
TALIESIN: That's 17 fire damage,
17 fire damage.

3990
02:14:11,553 --> 02:14:13,674
MATT: 17 fire damage, nice.

3991
02:14:13,674 --> 02:14:15,977
Okay, you hear the shot hit,

3992
02:14:15,977 --> 02:14:19,625
and you hear a cracking
sound as one of its plates

3993
02:14:19,625 --> 02:14:22,041
actually freezes and
shatters off of its body,

3994
02:14:22,041 --> 02:14:23,967
exposing kind of a fleshy undercarriage.

3995
02:14:23,967 --> 02:14:24,848
MARISHA: Nice.

3996
02:14:24,848 --> 02:14:26,012
[Orion And Marisha] Undercarriage.

3997
02:14:26,012 --> 02:14:28,115
MATT: This umber hulk is starting
to look a little rough.

3998
02:14:28,115 --> 02:14:29,845
That brings us to the top of--

3999
02:14:29,845 --> 02:14:31,396
Do you want to move 
or stay where you are?

4000
02:14:31,396 --> 02:14:33,769
TALIESIN: I'm going to step back to--

4001
02:14:33,769 --> 02:14:37,388
bring me back two to three
steps, just like, back away.

4002
02:14:37,388 --> 02:14:38,221
MATT: Back here.

4003
02:14:38,221 --> 02:14:39,054
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4004
02:14:39,054 --> 02:14:39,887
Just like, here.

4005
02:14:39,887 --> 02:14:41,330
LAURA: Avoid the snail.

4006
02:14:41,333 --> 02:14:42,992
SAM: Yeah, don't step on the snail.

4007
02:14:42,992 --> 02:14:44,707
TALIESIN: I'm not stepping on the snail.

4008
02:14:44,707 --> 02:14:46,130
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's good.

4009
02:14:46,130 --> 02:14:47,416
MATT: There? Okay, good.

4010
02:14:47,416 --> 02:14:48,899
All right, that brings us to--

4011
02:14:48,899 --> 02:14:49,772
LAURA: I'm using it!

4012
02:14:49,775 --> 02:14:51,128
MATT: Laser pointers, we have use.

4013
02:14:51,128 --> 02:14:51,961
Keyleth, you're up.

4014
02:14:51,961 --> 02:14:55,878
KEYLETH Okay, after seeing Grog
get confused, I turn,

4015
02:14:57,203 --> 02:15:02,263
and I go straight for his throat.

4016
02:15:02,263 --> 02:15:06,487
And I'm trying to drag him into the creek.

4017
02:15:06,487 --> 02:15:07,320
TRAVIS and LAURA: Ooh.

4018
02:15:07,320 --> 02:15:08,153
MATT: Okay.

4019
02:15:08,153 --> 02:15:09,586
MARISHA: I wanna take the umber hulk

4020
02:15:09,586 --> 02:15:11,299
into the creek right behind me.

4021
02:15:11,299 --> 02:15:13,328
MATT: Okay, so go ahead and roll for a grapple.

4022
02:15:13,328 --> 02:15:14,396
MARISHA: All right.

4023
02:15:14,396 --> 02:15:15,549
TRAVIS: Come on, cave bear.

4024
02:15:15,549 --> 02:15:18,321
MARISHA: How do I grapple as a bear?

4025
02:15:18,321 --> 02:15:20,048
LIAM: Bear hug, man, bear hug.

4026
02:15:20,048 --> 02:15:21,477
LAURA: Yeah, just take him.

4027
02:15:21,477 --> 02:15:23,870
TALIESIN: How does one grapple as a bear?

4028
02:15:23,870 --> 02:15:24,306
It is a strength check, I guess.

4029
02:15:24,306 --> 02:15:25,462
MATT: Does anyone else--

4030
02:15:25,462 --> 02:15:26,771
Can I have the book real fast?

4031
02:15:26,771 --> 02:15:28,684
Just to be sure we know
how we're doing this.

4032
02:15:28,684 --> 02:15:30,782
TALIESIN: Have you noticed
there's a rhinoceros in here?

4033
02:15:30,782 --> 02:15:32,195
MARISHA: I can be a a rhinoceros.

4034
02:15:32,195 --> 02:15:33,198
MATT: It's a contest, yes.

4035
02:15:33,199 --> 02:15:34,312
TRAVIS: Why have you not been
a rhinoceros yet?

4036
02:15:34,312 --> 02:15:35,956
MARISHA: It just hasn't been useful yet.

4037
02:15:35,956 --> 02:15:37,599
SAM: She usually picks a bird of some sort.

4038
02:15:37,599 --> 02:15:38,772
MARISHA: I'm waiting for the right time.

4039
02:15:38,772 --> 02:15:40,583
LIAM: She can only turn into
things she's seen.

4040
02:15:40,583 --> 02:15:41,980
SAM: I'm a squirrel and a bird!

4041
02:15:41,980 --> 02:15:43,951
You should be a rhinoceros.

4042
02:15:43,951 --> 02:15:47,281
TALIESIN: We're just waiting for you to
scream, "It's morphin time!"

4043
02:15:47,281 --> 02:15:48,792
It's morphing time!
Bear!

4044
02:15:48,792 --> 02:15:51,442
MARISHA: Oh my god, can you make me
smoke bombs that smoke,

4045
02:15:51,442 --> 02:15:53,142
and I say, "It's morphin time"?

4046
02:15:53,142 --> 02:15:55,845
MATT: So you can make a grapple attempt
in place of one of your attacks.

4047
02:15:55,845 --> 02:15:57,768
MARISHA: Okay.
That's what I want to do.

4048
02:15:57,768 --> 02:15:58,601
MATT: All right.

4049
02:15:58,601 --> 02:16:00,634
MARISHA: So I just strength check then?

4050
02:16:00,634 --> 02:16:02,394
MATT: So it is an athletics check.

4051
02:16:02,908 --> 02:16:05,832
MARISHA: Oh. I don't have stats, I'm a bear.

4052
02:16:05,832 --> 02:16:07,605
MATT: No, you use the bear's stats.

4053
02:16:07,605 --> 02:16:10,452
MARISHA: But all I have are the basic six.

4054
02:16:10,452 --> 02:16:11,704
MATT: Right, what's the strength?

4055
02:16:11,704 --> 02:16:12,537
MARISHA: Five.

4056
02:16:12,537 --> 02:16:13,370
MATT: Yeah.

4057
02:16:13,370 --> 02:16:14,203
MARISHA: So that's what I do.

4058
02:16:14,203 --> 02:16:15,557
MATT: Yeah, roll the dice, add plus five.

4059
02:16:15,557 --> 02:16:17,236
(group cheers)

4060
02:16:17,236 --> 02:16:18,090
ORION: It's 20!

4061
02:16:18,090 --> 02:16:19,112
MATT: Natural 20.

4062
02:16:19,112 --> 02:16:21,461
(clapping)

4063
02:16:21,461 --> 02:16:23,338
You reach forward and latch onto it

4064
02:16:23,338 --> 02:16:26,058
with your claws and your teeth,
onto the umber hulk.

4065
02:16:26,058 --> 02:16:27,591
MARISHA: Going for the throat.

4066
02:16:27,591 --> 02:16:28,689
MATT: Alright.

4067
02:16:28,689 --> 02:16:29,884
So that's your first attack.

4068
02:16:29,884 --> 02:16:31,276
You can go ahead while it's grappled

4069
02:16:31,276 --> 02:16:32,698
and attack with the other strikes.

4070
02:16:32,698 --> 02:16:35,294
MARISHA: I'm taking him underwater.

4071
02:16:35,294 --> 02:16:36,406
MATT: Okay.

4072
02:16:36,406 --> 02:16:37,294
You pull.

4073
02:16:37,294 --> 02:16:38,127
LAURA: Oh god, you're doing it, Keyleth.

4074
02:16:38,127 --> 02:16:40,324
MARISHA: Pulling him underwater.

4075
02:16:40,324 --> 02:16:41,156
LIAM: It's a waterfall, oh.

4076
02:16:41,156 --> 02:16:42,721
MATT: (imitates thudding) You both plunge

4077
02:16:42,721 --> 02:16:44,377
underneath the water's surface.

4078
02:16:44,377 --> 02:16:46,540
Take a big old breath right beforehand,

4079
02:16:46,540 --> 02:16:47,723
and I'm going underwater.

4080
02:16:47,723 --> 02:16:50,176
ORION: Wait, can you let him
go and let him drown?

4081
02:16:50,176 --> 02:16:52,077
LAURA: Yeah, let him go, 'cause it's a waterfall.

4082
02:16:52,077 --> 02:16:53,863
MARISHA: No, I'm holding on to him.

4083
02:16:53,863 --> 02:16:55,364
LAURA: But Keyleth, there's a waterfall.

4084
02:16:55,364 --> 02:16:56,778
It's fine.

4085
02:16:56,778 --> 02:16:58,138
MATT: It's now its turn.

4086
02:16:58,138 --> 02:17:00,308
It's going to try
and break your grapple.

4087
02:17:00,308 --> 02:17:02,439
MATT: Make an athletics check.

4088
02:17:02,439 --> 02:17:04,263
MARISHA: Against his strength, I guess.

4089
02:17:04,263 --> 02:17:05,617
Ah, 20.

4090
02:17:05,617 --> 02:17:06,450
MATT: 20, okay.

4091
02:17:06,450 --> 02:17:07,974
You maintain your grip on the umber hulk.

4092
02:17:07,974 --> 02:17:09,580
It's thrashing in the
water trying to get its way

4093
02:17:09,580 --> 02:17:11,401
to the surface. (snarls)

4094
02:17:11,401 --> 02:17:13,218
Still slashing about.

4095
02:17:13,218 --> 02:17:15,859
So it's gonna make its
attacks against you.

4096
02:17:15,859 --> 02:17:16,941
MATT: That is a 14.

4097
02:17:18,097 --> 02:17:19,441
MARISHA: Hits.

4098
02:17:19,441 --> 02:17:20,809
MATT: 14 hits you?

4099
02:17:20,809 --> 02:17:23,495
MARISHA: I'm a bear, my armor
class is 12 right now.

4100
02:17:23,495 --> 02:17:25,249
MATT: Well no, you keep your armor class.

4101
02:17:25,249 --> 02:17:26,892
MARISHA: I keep my armor class?

4102
02:17:26,892 --> 02:17:28,059
MATT: I'm pretty sure.

4103
02:17:28,059 --> 02:17:29,398
LIAM: Yes, the answer to that is yes.

4104
02:17:29,398 --> 02:17:30,232
TRAVIS: Yeah, you do.

4105
02:17:30,232 --> 02:17:31,315
LIAM: Definitely yes.

4106
02:17:31,315 --> 02:17:33,477
MATT: Nah, let's see real fast
actually on this one.

4107
02:17:33,477 --> 02:17:35,932
SAM: Keep subscribing
to Geek &amp; Sundry everybody.

4108
02:17:35,932 --> 02:17:36,764
MATT: Exactly.

4109
02:17:36,764 --> 02:17:40,018
SAM: We're going for 1200 subscribers tonight,

4110
02:17:40,018 --> 02:17:41,535
and if we reach that number...

4111
02:17:42,558 --> 02:17:43,485
good for you.

4112
02:17:43,485 --> 02:17:45,789
(group laughs)

4113
02:17:45,789 --> 02:17:46,910
MATT: Here we go.

4114
02:17:46,910 --> 02:17:49,218
LIAM: Sam will write a ballad.

4115
02:17:49,218 --> 02:17:50,052
SAM: I will.

4116
02:17:50,052 --> 02:17:51,885
MATT: You gain the scores--

4117
02:17:56,460 --> 02:17:58,585
SAM: By the way, this music is just great.

4118
02:17:58,585 --> 02:18:00,369
MATT: It's 12 plus-- it's whatever the 12 is,

4119
02:18:00,369 --> 02:18:02,468
plus your proficiency modifier,
I think is what it is.

4120
02:18:02,468 --> 02:18:04,718
For now, we'll say it hits.

4121
02:18:05,973 --> 02:18:07,644
'Cause I don't wanna hold this up.

4122
02:18:07,644 --> 02:18:09,562
TALIESIN: There once was a player--

4123
02:18:09,562 --> 02:18:10,712
SAM: In Nantucket?

4124
02:18:10,712 --> 02:18:11,818
LAURA: Don't.

4125
02:18:11,818 --> 02:18:13,800
MATT: No, you gain its armor class.

4126
02:18:13,800 --> 02:18:14,773
MARISHA: I do gain its armor class.

4127
02:18:14,773 --> 02:18:15,607
MATT: Yeah, you do.

4128
02:18:15,607 --> 02:18:16,580
MARISHA: So it hits.

4129
02:18:16,580 --> 02:18:17,986
MATT: Yeah, it hits you.
All right.

4130
02:18:17,986 --> 02:18:18,939
Second strike.

4131
02:18:18,939 --> 02:18:21,469
That's also gonna hit you.

4132
02:18:21,469 --> 02:18:22,831
All three hit you.

4133
02:18:22,831 --> 02:18:26,081
You take six points of slashing damage.

4134
02:18:27,768 --> 02:18:30,184
11 points of slashing damage.

4135
02:18:31,486 --> 02:18:32,654
And 6, 11, 17--

4136
02:18:35,468 --> 02:18:36,300
MARISHA: It's okay guys.

4137
02:18:36,300 --> 02:18:37,805
MATT: Total of 26 points of slashing damage.

4138
02:18:37,805 --> 02:18:39,922
MARISHA: I am no longer a bear.

4139
02:18:39,922 --> 02:18:42,315
MATT: So you lose your grip
as your form reverts.

4140
02:18:42,315 --> 02:18:45,673
You are now back to
Keyleth's form in the water.

4141
02:18:45,673 --> 02:18:48,673
SAM: And you're in the water!

4142
02:18:48,673 --> 02:18:51,359
MARISHA: Can I cast a concentration
spell on myself?

4143
02:18:51,359 --> 02:18:54,418
MATT: No, because you used your
actions to grapple it.

4144
02:18:54,418 --> 02:18:55,251
MARISHA: And that's it.

4145
02:18:55,251 --> 02:18:59,019
MATT: So you're now just back in
the Keyleth form, underwater.

4146
02:18:59,019 --> 02:19:00,947
You catch your breath and
realize you're now underwater

4147
02:19:00,947 --> 02:19:03,519
in near darkness with an
umber hulk right on you.

4148
02:19:03,519 --> 02:19:04,862
MARISHA: Hey brah. Sup?

4149
02:19:04,862 --> 02:19:06,055
Fancy meeting you here.

4150
02:19:06,055 --> 02:19:07,123
MATT: Vax, you're up.

4151
02:19:07,123 --> 02:19:08,626
LIAM: Okay, so first thing I do is lean down

4152
02:19:08,626 --> 02:19:10,816
and pick up the snail
off the ground and say,

4153
02:19:10,816 --> 02:19:12,862
"Hey, um, go fuck yourself."

4154
02:19:12,862 --> 02:19:14,785
And then I throw him into the waterfall.

4155
02:19:14,785 --> 02:19:15,618
SAM: Oh Jesus!

4156
02:19:15,618 --> 02:19:16,811
MATT: Over here?

4157
02:19:16,811 --> 02:19:17,644
LIAM: Yeah.

4158
02:19:17,644 --> 02:19:18,477
MATT: All right.

4159
02:19:18,477 --> 02:19:19,517
Go ahead and roll a ranged attack.

4160
02:19:19,517 --> 02:19:21,029
So just roll, add dexterity.

4161
02:19:21,029 --> 02:19:21,861
LIAM: Okay.

4162
02:19:21,861 --> 02:19:22,977
LAURA: Oh gosh, okay okay.

4163
02:19:22,977 --> 02:19:24,397
LIAM: Great great great.

4164
02:19:24,397 --> 02:19:25,484
Dexterity you say? 18.

4165
02:19:25,484 --> 02:19:26,300
MATT: 18?

4166
02:19:26,300 --> 02:19:27,891
LAURA: No, it's higher than that, yo!

4167
02:19:27,891 --> 02:19:29,564
ORION: No, it's fine if he drowns and dies.

4168
02:19:29,564 --> 02:19:32,115
LIAM: Oh sorry, yeah, that's 21.

4169
02:19:33,014 --> 02:19:33,848
22, 22.

4170
02:19:33,848 --> 02:19:36,014
MATT: You throw, it arcs over.

4171
02:19:37,189 --> 02:19:39,238
Lands in the water.

4172
02:19:39,238 --> 02:19:41,798
(imitates water sucking)
Goes under into the waterfall.

4173
02:19:41,798 --> 02:19:43,020
LIAM: Toodle-oo shitface.

4174
02:19:43,020 --> 02:19:45,762
SAM: Hey wait, he (stutters) he swam away?

4175
02:19:45,762 --> 02:19:48,741
MATT: No, he threw the snail over the waterfall.

4176
02:19:48,741 --> 02:19:49,647
SAM: Hey!
Bye-bye!

4177
02:19:50,270 --> 02:19:52,548
LIAM: Now, that seems like a
bonus action to me, right?

4178
02:19:52,548 --> 02:19:53,409
(group laughs)

4179
02:19:53,409 --> 02:19:54,242
MATT: That's an attack.

4180
02:19:54,242 --> 02:19:57,213
LIAM: So then that's an attack, okay.

4181
02:19:57,213 --> 02:19:58,752
MARISHA: (laughs) That's an attack.

4182
02:19:58,752 --> 02:20:00,763
MATT: It's the world's easiest grapple throw.

4183
02:20:00,763 --> 02:20:01,965
TRAVIS: You threw him forever.

4184
02:20:01,965 --> 02:20:02,996
LIAM: Then I'm good.

4185
02:20:02,996 --> 02:20:03,829
LAURA: That's it?

4186
02:20:03,829 --> 02:20:06,589
LIAM: Well, that's my action, right?

4187
02:20:06,589 --> 02:20:07,422
MATT: Correct.

4188
02:20:07,422 --> 02:20:08,685
LIAM: And I only have one.

4189
02:20:08,685 --> 02:20:10,189
SAM: You can move, you can move.

4190
02:20:10,189 --> 02:20:11,683
LIAM: All right, so then,

4191
02:20:11,683 --> 02:20:15,131
I'll hop through, through
Percy and my sister.

4192
02:20:15,131 --> 02:20:18,120
And run up behind the shithead
who's fucking with Keyleth.

4193
02:20:18,120 --> 02:20:21,163
MATT: Make an acrobatics check,
try to tumble through them.

4194
02:20:21,163 --> 02:20:22,406
LIAM: Yeah, that's easy.

4195
02:20:22,445 --> 02:20:23,618
ORION: He's in the water, though.

4196
02:20:23,618 --> 02:20:24,796
LIAM: 16 (mumbles) 29.

4197
02:20:24,796 --> 02:20:26,319
MATT: Yeah, you're fine, and
where do you wanna go?

4198
02:20:26,319 --> 02:20:29,148
LIAM: Right up behind shitface there.

4199
02:20:29,148 --> 02:20:30,857
And do I have anything left?

4200
02:20:30,857 --> 02:20:33,570
Or do I just get there and stop.

4201
02:20:33,570 --> 02:20:34,664
MATT: Well, it was the attack to throw it.

4202
02:20:34,664 --> 02:20:35,497
You would have your second off-hand.

4203
02:20:35,497 --> 02:20:36,330
LIAM: Second attack.

4204
02:20:36,330 --> 02:20:37,462
Well let's stab him in
the ass then, right.

4205
02:20:37,462 --> 02:20:39,665
MATT: Well, you have disadvantage
'cause it's currently

4206
02:20:39,665 --> 02:20:40,968
in the water thrashing about,

4207
02:20:40,968 --> 02:20:43,020
and it's hard to see.

4208
02:20:43,020 --> 02:20:45,437
Well, that's not very good.

4209
02:20:45,437 --> 02:20:47,022
15.

4210
02:20:47,022 --> 02:20:48,172
MATT: 15 misses unfortunately.

4211
02:20:48,172 --> 02:20:50,569
So as you slash down with
your dagger into the water,

4212
02:20:50,569 --> 02:20:52,231
it's just too hard to really make out

4213
02:20:52,231 --> 02:20:53,927
what that form moving is.

4214
02:20:53,927 --> 02:20:55,912
LIAM: I still feel pretty good about that round.

4215
02:20:55,912 --> 02:20:57,540
TRAVIS: Yeah, it was pretty good.

4216
02:20:57,540 --> 02:20:58,683
MATT: Grog, you're up.

4217
02:20:58,683 --> 02:20:59,706
TRAVIS: Am I? (grunts)

4218
02:20:59,706 --> 02:21:02,012
With my frenzied rage renewed,

4219
02:21:02,012 --> 02:21:05,890
I run towards the water,
haunted by nightmares

4220
02:21:05,890 --> 02:21:07,867
of Sebastian in the Little Mermaid,

4221
02:21:07,867 --> 02:21:12,860
and I leap into the water and
start slashing and slashing.

4222
02:21:12,860 --> 02:21:13,693
MATT: Go ahead and make your
three attacks, Grog.

4223
02:21:13,693 --> 02:21:16,124
(Liam sings opening
notes to "Under the Sea")

4224
02:21:16,124 --> 02:21:19,266
TRAVIS: ♫ Le poisson, le poisson,
hee hee hee, fuck you bitch ♫

4225
02:21:19,266 --> 02:21:20,822
(Matt laughs)

4226
02:21:20,822 --> 02:21:24,989
TRAVIS: 18 plus... that's 26.

4227
02:21:25,374 --> 02:21:26,418
MATT: 26 hits.

4228
02:21:26,418 --> 02:21:27,251
TRAVIS: Okay, good.
Second attack.

4229
02:21:27,785 --> 02:21:28,618
26.

4230
02:21:28,618 --> 02:21:29,451
MATT: Hits.

4231
02:21:31,580 --> 02:21:32,927
TRAVIS: Okay. 25.

4232
02:21:32,927 --> 02:21:33,760
MATT: Hits.

4233
02:21:33,760 --> 02:21:34,593
TRAVIS: Good.

4234
02:21:34,593 --> 02:21:35,828
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage, Grog.

4235
02:21:35,828 --> 02:21:37,658
As you come charging
forward, just (grunts),

4236
02:21:37,658 --> 02:21:40,322
leaving bits of foam cascading
off the side of your mouth.

4237
02:21:40,322 --> 02:21:42,676
Your eyes just glazed over with white.

4238
02:21:42,676 --> 02:21:44,273
You bring the axe down into the water,

4239
02:21:44,273 --> 02:21:46,218
form towards where the splashing is.

4240
02:21:46,218 --> 02:21:50,305
Keeping mindful that Keyleth
might be in there somewhere.

4241
02:21:50,305 --> 02:21:53,627
But you're very much see the
larger form in the field, so.

4242
02:21:53,627 --> 02:21:56,564
TRAVIS: It's all about sushi right?
MARISHA: Oh, I'm fine.

4243
02:21:56,564 --> 02:21:58,883
MATT: Yeah, so damage on the first strike?

4244
02:21:58,883 --> 02:22:01,050
TRAVIS: Eight, second one is 16.

4245
02:22:01,050 --> 02:22:03,074
MATT: Eight, 16, that's 24.

4246
02:22:03,074 --> 02:22:04,491
TRAVIS: And 17, thirty.

4247
02:22:05,475 --> 02:22:07,581
What's 24 plus 10?

4248
02:22:07,581 --> 02:22:08,414
LAURA AND MATT: 34.

4249
02:22:09,794 --> 02:22:10,646
MATT: Grog.

4250
02:22:10,646 --> 02:22:12,313
34 points of damage.

4251
02:22:13,728 --> 02:22:16,640
As your axe comes down,
slam once into the water.

4252
02:22:16,640 --> 02:22:18,554
You see one of the claws
start pulling itself up

4253
02:22:18,554 --> 02:22:19,678
out of the surface.

4254
02:22:19,678 --> 02:22:21,048
It's head's still under the water.

4255
02:22:21,048 --> 02:22:22,047
You slam the axe down.

4256
02:22:22,047 --> 02:22:24,490
You see the arm actually snaps

4257
02:22:24,490 --> 02:22:25,624
and begins to drift down the river.

4258
02:22:25,624 --> 02:22:28,107
As it looks up at you, its eyes open.

4259
02:22:28,107 --> 02:22:30,322
Before the gaze can meet
yours, the axe comes down

4260
02:22:30,322 --> 02:22:32,446
and plunges itself
directly into the forehead

4261
02:22:32,446 --> 02:22:36,819
of the umber hulk with a
shunk sound.

4262
02:22:36,819 --> 02:22:40,053
As it does, its body goes limp and begins
to float down the water.

4263
02:22:40,053 --> 02:22:42,420
(group cheers and claps)

4264
02:22:43,520 --> 02:22:45,353
LAURA: Well, that was easy.

4265
02:22:46,358 --> 02:22:47,569
SAM: Was it?

4266
02:22:47,569 --> 02:22:51,160
LAURA: I walk up and try to help
Keyleth out of the water.

4267
02:22:51,160 --> 02:22:51,993
MATT: Okay.

4268
02:22:52,832 --> 02:22:55,832
You help Keyleth out of the water.

4269
02:22:58,177 --> 02:23:01,482
At this point, the snail form,

4270
02:23:01,482 --> 02:23:02,747
which doesn't have a
whole lot of hit points,

4271
02:23:02,747 --> 02:23:05,555
has taken enough damage
to alleviate itself

4272
02:23:05,555 --> 02:23:07,138
from the polymorph.

4273
02:23:08,110 --> 02:23:10,958
As the spell fades, as the
snail form is destroyed,

4274
02:23:10,958 --> 02:23:13,793
the other umber hulk
begins clawing its way

4275
02:23:13,793 --> 02:23:15,422
up the side of the mountain,

4276
02:23:15,422 --> 02:23:17,281
burrows through the actual stonework--

4277
02:23:17,281 --> 02:23:18,481
LAURA: Ah, balls.

4278
02:23:18,481 --> 02:23:20,497
MATT: --(imitates explosion) and
bursts out of the ground

4279
02:23:20,497 --> 02:23:22,010
right behind you, Vax.

4280
02:23:22,010 --> 02:23:22,925
(imitates explosion)

4281
02:23:22,925 --> 02:23:24,126
VAX: Oh, fuck a duck.

4282
02:23:24,126 --> 02:23:25,416
TRAVIS: Come on, drop this thing.

4283
02:23:25,416 --> 02:23:27,183
LAURA: This is why you shouldn't
have thrown the snail.

4284
02:23:27,183 --> 02:23:28,938
MATT: But that's its turn.

4285
02:23:28,938 --> 02:23:31,345
LIAM: I thought it would get
washed all the way out.

4286
02:23:31,345 --> 02:23:33,950
Down the toilet, all the way out.

4287
02:23:33,950 --> 02:23:35,593
MATT: All right, that brings us
to the top of the round.

4288
02:23:35,593 --> 02:23:36,459
Tiberius.

4289
02:23:36,459 --> 02:23:38,018
MARISHA: It was at least badass.

4290
02:23:38,018 --> 02:23:39,061
LIAM: Elegant.

4291
02:23:39,061 --> 02:23:40,180
MARISHA: It was very elegant.

4292
02:23:40,180 --> 02:23:41,873
TALIESIN: I'm sure it was 
a wonderful thought.

4293
02:23:41,873 --> 02:23:42,977
ORION: Firebolt.

4294
02:23:42,977 --> 02:23:44,163
MATT: Okay, roll for it.

4295
02:23:44,163 --> 02:23:45,344
Roll for the attacks.

4296
02:23:45,637 --> 02:23:47,205
LIAM: Just past it, please.

4297
02:23:47,205 --> 02:23:49,324
MATT: Yep, any directed spell like that

4298
02:23:49,324 --> 02:23:52,161
you have to roll and add
your spell range modifier.

4299
02:23:52,161 --> 02:23:54,050
ORION: Sweet, that does not hit.

4300
02:23:54,050 --> 02:23:54,883
MATT: What'd you roll?

4301
02:23:54,883 --> 02:23:55,716
ORION: Uh, 11.

4302
02:23:57,697 --> 02:23:59,026
MATT: Disadvantage, so.

4303
02:23:59,026 --> 02:23:59,859
You rolled an 11 total?

4304
02:23:59,859 --> 02:24:00,758
ORION: 10.

4305
02:24:00,758 --> 02:24:02,269
MATT: Yeah, you miss.

4306
02:24:02,269 --> 02:24:05,312
So, as you aim your firebolt
(imitated fire shooting)

4307
02:24:05,312 --> 02:24:06,842
You're just averting your gaze,

4308
02:24:06,842 --> 02:24:09,344
and it jumps over and arcs
through the rest of the carvern,

4309
02:24:09,344 --> 02:24:12,432
lighting it as it goes like a flare.

4310
02:24:12,432 --> 02:24:13,475
ORION: Good cavern.

4311
02:24:13,475 --> 02:24:14,987
MATT: That leads to Scanlan.

4312
02:24:14,987 --> 02:24:15,794
SAM: Scanlan?

4313
02:24:15,794 --> 02:24:16,936
MATT: Actually no, Vex is up
and then Scanlan, sorry.

4314
02:24:16,936 --> 02:24:17,769
LAURA: Me?

4315
02:24:17,769 --> 02:24:18,721
MATT: You, you.

4316
02:24:18,721 --> 02:24:20,242
LIAM: Kill it before it kills me.

4317
02:24:20,242 --> 02:24:21,075
Okay.

4318
02:24:21,075 --> 02:24:23,617
LAURA: I am gonna keep my gaze
averted, but I just heard it,

4319
02:24:23,617 --> 02:24:24,450
and I'm gonna--

4320
02:24:24,450 --> 02:24:26,422
ORION: That rhymed.

4321
02:24:26,422 --> 02:24:28,604
LAURA: I'm gonna attack it.
WIth some arrows.

4322
02:24:28,604 --> 02:24:29,387
MATT: Go for it.

4323
02:24:29,387 --> 02:24:31,907
So two arrows, notched.
(imitates arrows firing)

4324
02:24:31,907 --> 02:24:33,299
Disadvantage on each attack.

4325
02:24:33,299 --> 02:24:34,374
LAURA: Oh, okay.

4326
02:24:34,374 --> 02:24:35,570
LIAM: Don't let it eat my head, please.

4327
02:24:35,570 --> 02:24:36,536
LAURA: Yeah, it's the same. 18.

4328
02:24:36,536 --> 02:24:37,427
No, lying.

4329
02:24:37,427 --> 02:24:38,260
20.

4330
02:24:38,260 --> 02:24:39,093
MATT: 20 hits.

4331
02:24:39,093 --> 02:24:41,575
Go ahead and roll for the second attack.

4332
02:24:43,458 --> 02:24:45,099
LAURA: 19.

4333
02:24:45,099 --> 02:24:45,932
MATT: Both hit.

4334
02:24:45,932 --> 02:24:46,765
LAURA: Okay, good.

4335
02:24:46,765 --> 02:24:49,419
MATT: Go ahead and
roll damage on each.

4336
02:24:49,419 --> 02:24:52,819
LAURA: Is this the one
that I Hunter's Marked?

4337
02:24:52,819 --> 02:24:53,652
No, the other one Hunter's Marked.

4338
02:24:53,652 --> 02:24:54,550
MATT: The other one was, yeah.

4339
02:24:54,550 --> 02:24:55,495
LAURA: Okay, that's fine.
10 plus 13 is 23.

4340
02:24:55,495 --> 02:24:57,491
MATT: But you could switch
over your hunter's mark.

4341
02:24:57,491 --> 02:24:59,279
LAURA: And I switched over my Hunter's
Mark as my bonus action.

4342
02:24:59,279 --> 02:25:00,324
MATT: With your bonus action.

4343
02:25:00,324 --> 02:25:02,241
LAURA: So I add the-- oh, one.

4344
02:25:03,784 --> 02:25:05,430
MATT: So a total of?

4345
02:25:05,430 --> 02:25:06,263
LAURA: 24.

4346
02:25:06,263 --> 02:25:07,096
MATT: 24 points of damage.

4347
02:25:07,096 --> 02:25:08,426
All right, got you.

4348
02:25:08,426 --> 02:25:10,566
(imitates arrows flying)
The arrows end up piercing

4349
02:25:10,566 --> 02:25:11,399
part of the armor.

4350
02:25:11,399 --> 02:25:14,590
Each sink in a good, solid
six, seven inches or so.

4351
02:25:14,590 --> 02:25:17,498
It angrily (wet snarling) at the impact,

4352
02:25:17,498 --> 02:25:19,749
but it wasn't enough force
to send it back at all.

4353
02:25:19,749 --> 02:25:21,794
But it knows exactly where you are.

4354
02:25:21,794 --> 02:25:23,683
That brings us to Scanlan.

4355
02:25:23,683 --> 02:25:25,732
SAM: Scanlan's gonna move
right in front of where--

4356
02:25:25,732 --> 02:25:27,037
I believe that's Percy?

4357
02:25:27,037 --> 02:25:28,019
LIAM: Save the day, Scanny.

4358
02:25:28,019 --> 02:25:30,459
LAURA: Oh yeah, I should've ran Trinket up there.

4359
02:25:30,459 --> 02:25:32,975
LIAM: Repeat, just like last week.

4360
02:25:34,031 --> 02:25:36,939
SAM: Toss another dice to Percy,
he seems to need them.

4361
02:25:36,939 --> 02:25:37,871
TALIESIN: Thank you.

4362
02:25:37,871 --> 02:25:41,477
SAM: And I'm gonna cast
lightning bolt at the thing.

4363
02:25:41,477 --> 02:25:44,062
Who's wet from being in the water, yes?

4364
02:25:44,062 --> 02:25:47,316
So electricity is gonna
be pretty bad on him.

4365
02:25:47,316 --> 02:25:48,149
MATT: All right.

4366
02:25:49,014 --> 02:25:52,123
So, because you're kind of averting
your gaze to look away--

4367
02:25:52,123 --> 02:25:52,956
SAM: Disadvantage.

4368
02:25:52,956 --> 02:25:54,688
MATT: No, because you don't roll to attack.

4369
02:25:54,688 --> 02:25:57,150
But it gets advantage on its saving throw
because of that aspect.

4370
02:25:57,150 --> 02:25:59,910
MATT: So, it rolled natural 20 for its saving,

4371
02:25:59,910 --> 02:26:00,846
so it takes half damage.

4372
02:26:00,846 --> 02:26:02,143
But go ahead and roll your 8d6,

4373
02:26:02,143 --> 02:26:03,300
it's the lighting bolt.

4374
02:26:03,300 --> 02:26:04,133
SAM: 8d6.

4375
02:26:04,133 --> 02:26:04,966
MATT: Arcs out from your fingers.
(imitates lightning)

4376
02:26:04,966 --> 02:26:06,194
SAM: 8d6, 8d6.

4377
02:26:06,194 --> 02:26:07,027
8d6?!

4378
02:26:08,415 --> 02:26:09,248
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4379
02:26:09,248 --> 02:26:10,081
SAM: 8?!

4380
02:26:10,081 --> 02:26:10,914
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4381
02:26:10,914 --> 02:26:11,747
LIAM: Yes.

4382
02:26:11,747 --> 02:26:12,580
SAM: Shit!

4383
02:26:12,580 --> 02:26:13,514
(group laughs)

4384
02:26:13,514 --> 02:26:16,847
Uh, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12.

4385
02:26:19,250 --> 02:26:20,623
(group laughs)

4386
02:26:20,623 --> 02:26:23,987
13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,
20, 21, 22 (mutters softly)

4387
02:26:23,987 --> 02:26:24,950
28!

4388
02:26:24,950 --> 02:26:25,783
MATT: 28, okay.

4389
02:26:25,783 --> 02:26:27,248
14 points of damage to the umber hulk

4390
02:26:27,248 --> 02:26:30,409
as the bolt of lightning
cascades through its body.

4391
02:26:30,409 --> 02:26:32,012
It lights up for a second as you see

4392
02:26:32,012 --> 02:26:35,013
the crawling fingers
of electricity kind of

4393
02:26:35,013 --> 02:26:36,102
shoot through its plates.

4394
02:26:36,102 --> 02:26:37,293
SAM: I like crawling fingers.

4395
02:26:37,293 --> 02:26:38,126
MATT: Indeed.

4396
02:26:38,126 --> 02:26:40,100
ORION: That was the name of
the one girl, wasn't it?

4397
02:26:40,100 --> 02:26:41,088
SAM: Yes.

4398
02:26:41,088 --> 02:26:42,901
MARISHA: Oh, I loved Crawline, she was so nice.

4399
02:26:42,901 --> 02:26:44,154
MATT: As the bolt grounds itself,

4400
02:26:44,154 --> 02:26:47,251
the rest of the water on
its form evaporates

4401
02:26:47,251 --> 02:26:49,026
from the sheer force of the electricity.

4402
02:26:49,026 --> 02:26:51,202
You see the umber hulk still standing.

4403
02:26:51,202 --> 02:26:54,632
Angry, in pain, and
standing, although it's still

4404
02:26:54,632 --> 02:26:57,301
looking a little worse for wear.

4405
02:26:57,301 --> 02:26:58,783
You don't wanna do that to an umber hulk.

4406
02:26:58,783 --> 02:27:00,380
(group laughs)

4407
02:27:00,380 --> 02:27:02,045
SAM: You're right.

4408
02:27:02,045 --> 02:27:02,970
MATT: Percy, you're up.

4409
02:27:02,970 --> 02:27:06,383
TALIESIN: Taking my shot, I'm averting my eyes, so.

4410
02:27:06,383 --> 02:27:08,470
SAM: Use those dice, use those dice.

4411
02:27:08,470 --> 02:27:09,532
MARISHA: Whoo!

4412
02:27:09,532 --> 02:27:10,816
TALIESIN: 24 to hit.

4413
02:27:10,816 --> 02:27:11,680
MATT: That was the disadvantage?

4414
02:27:11,680 --> 02:27:12,824
TALIESIN: At the disadvantage.

4415
02:27:12,824 --> 02:27:13,881
MATT: Awesome, that hits.

4416
02:27:13,881 --> 02:27:15,798
TALIESIN: That's 1d8 plus five.

4417
02:27:18,103 --> 02:27:19,885
That's, ugh, that's terrible.

4418
02:27:19,885 --> 02:27:21,845
That's six points of damage.

4419
02:27:21,845 --> 02:27:23,122
I'm taking my second shot.

4420
02:27:23,122 --> 02:27:24,326
MATT: All right.

4421
02:27:24,326 --> 02:27:26,326
LIAM: Shoot it in the mouth.

4422
02:27:27,247 --> 02:27:28,564
(clapping)

4423
02:27:28,564 --> 02:27:30,646
MARISHA: Oh wait, but it's disadvantage.

4424
02:27:30,646 --> 02:27:31,711
TALIESIN: I rolled twice.

4425
02:27:31,711 --> 02:27:33,197
So I rolled a 19 and a 20, which means--

4426
02:27:33,197 --> 02:27:34,297
MARISHA: Which are both your critical, right?

4427
02:27:34,297 --> 02:27:35,130
Which are both my criticals.

4428
02:27:35,963 --> 02:27:36,995
So a critical at a disadvantage.

4429
02:27:36,995 --> 02:27:37,828
TRAVIS: Sick, nasty.

4430
02:27:37,828 --> 02:27:38,661
TALIESIN: Just point, nyah, nyah!

4431
02:27:38,661 --> 02:27:39,877
LIAM: Yes Percy.
Critical on a disadvantage!

4432
02:27:39,877 --> 02:27:40,710
MATT: Well done.

4433
02:27:40,710 --> 02:27:41,939
TALIESIN: So I'm also gonna spend my die.

4434
02:27:41,939 --> 02:27:43,820
LIAM: Whatever your last name is again.

4435
02:27:43,820 --> 02:27:45,130
SAM: The die is for the attack.

4436
02:27:45,130 --> 02:27:47,645
MATT: It's for attacks, skills,
and saving throws,

4437
02:27:47,645 --> 02:27:48,478
not for damage.

4438
02:27:49,432 --> 02:27:50,275
TALIESIN: That's, uh...

4439
02:27:50,275 --> 02:27:53,014
five, six, seven, eight,
that's 11 points of damage.

4440
02:27:53,014 --> 02:27:54,146
TRAVIS: Finish him.

4441
02:27:54,146 --> 02:27:56,215
MATT: 11 points of damage from the first one.

4442
02:27:56,215 --> 02:27:57,914
TALIESIN: 11 points of damage from the second one.

4443
02:27:57,914 --> 02:27:59,768
MARISHA: But that one's critical.

4444
02:27:59,768 --> 02:28:00,892
So it doubles, right?

4445
02:28:01,555 --> 02:28:03,536
TALIESIN: It's just 1d8 becomes 2d8, right?

4446
02:28:03,536 --> 02:28:04,679
MATT: Correct, yeah.

4447
02:28:04,679 --> 02:28:06,047
TALIESIN: Yeah that's-- yeah.

4448
02:28:06,047 --> 02:28:07,944
MATT: Okay, it's 11 points damage.
Gotcha.

4449
02:28:08,777 --> 02:28:11,108
So, as you rear back
your shot (imitates gun firing)

4450
02:28:11,108 --> 02:28:11,941
it resounds.

4451
02:28:11,941 --> 02:28:13,760
It hits the plate, shatters
it on the other side

4452
02:28:13,760 --> 02:28:14,750
of its chest.

4453
02:28:14,750 --> 02:28:16,903
You can now see this
weird purplish goo

4454
02:28:16,903 --> 02:28:18,636
beginning to spill from its wounds.

4455
02:28:18,636 --> 02:28:20,451
You see it's holding itself up,

4456
02:28:20,451 --> 02:28:23,111
and it's having a hard time
keeping physical form there.

4457
02:28:23,111 --> 02:28:24,577
Keyleth, you're up.

4458
02:28:24,577 --> 02:28:25,744
MARISHA: Oh. Um, cool.

4459
02:28:27,513 --> 02:28:28,346
(Liam laughs)

4460
02:28:28,346 --> 02:28:29,179
ORION: Word.

4461
02:28:29,179 --> 02:28:30,012
MARISHA: Word.

4462
02:28:31,152 --> 02:28:32,488
I'm still a person.

4463
02:28:34,295 --> 02:28:36,846
I'm gonna go ahead and also
do a call lighting spell.

4464
02:28:36,846 --> 02:28:39,525
Bam, call lightning right on its head.
'Cause he's wet.

4465
02:28:39,525 --> 02:28:40,997
MATT: Call lighting it is.

4466
02:28:40,997 --> 02:28:43,636
MATT: So, as you begin to complete your spell,

4467
02:28:43,636 --> 02:28:45,221
you can see now the upper arch,

4468
02:28:45,221 --> 02:28:47,837
the 100 foot archway, the
ceiling of this area begins

4469
02:28:47,837 --> 02:28:50,447
to fill with this strange
cloudy, thunderous booms,

4470
02:28:50,447 --> 02:28:53,330
as a raincloud is created
and summoned across the rooftop.

4471
02:28:54,487 --> 02:28:56,665
At which point, Keyleth frees her hand up

4472
02:28:56,665 --> 02:28:59,409
and pulls down as a single
bolt streaks through the air,

4473
02:28:59,409 --> 02:29:01,887
slamming into the same
lightning bolt wound

4474
02:29:01,887 --> 02:29:03,749
that you left previously on it,

4475
02:29:03,749 --> 02:29:06,175
where the edges of its
armor are still glowing

4476
02:29:06,175 --> 02:29:07,112
from the heat.

4477
02:29:07,112 --> 02:29:08,375
Go ahead and roll damage.

4478
02:29:08,375 --> 02:29:09,598
MARISHA: Got him right in the ass.

4479
02:29:10,132 --> 02:29:11,463
It just gets straight damage?

4480
02:29:11,463 --> 02:29:13,779
MATT: Yeah, it gets a bonus on
its saving throw, though.

4481
02:29:13,779 --> 02:29:14,562
Or advantage.

4482
02:29:14,562 --> 02:29:16,191
Which it makes.

4483
02:29:16,191 --> 02:29:17,912
MARISHA: I get 3d10.

4484
02:29:17,912 --> 02:29:18,745
MATT: 3d10.

4485
02:29:18,745 --> 02:29:20,495
All right, go for it.

4486
02:29:21,778 --> 02:29:22,611
MARISHA: 6, 7--

4487
02:29:25,375 --> 02:29:27,318
MATT: It is no longer outdoors-only.

4488
02:29:27,318 --> 02:29:29,428
MATT: It gets a bonus for being outdoors.

4489
02:29:29,428 --> 02:29:30,261
MARISHA: 11 damage.

4490
02:29:30,261 --> 02:29:31,373
MATT: 11 damage to the umber hulk.

4491
02:29:31,373 --> 02:29:32,206
Which is halved.

4492
02:29:32,206 --> 02:29:34,394
He made a saving throw, to a six.

4493
02:29:34,394 --> 02:29:35,715
MARISHA: Saving throw, mm.

4494
02:29:35,715 --> 02:29:36,548
MATT: Yeah.

4495
02:29:36,548 --> 02:29:37,381
TRAVIS: Finish him.

4496
02:29:37,381 --> 02:29:38,319
Cause you're having to avert your gaze.

4497
02:29:38,319 --> 02:29:39,684
You're trying to
work out this whole thing

4498
02:29:39,684 --> 02:29:41,210
where you're all basically
at a severe disadvantage

4499
02:29:41,210 --> 02:29:42,347
fighting this thing, unless you want

4500
02:29:42,347 --> 02:29:44,736
to be completely fucked over.

4501
02:29:44,736 --> 02:29:45,602
All right.

4502
02:29:45,602 --> 02:29:48,047
SAM: Should have created sunglasses
for him or something.

4503
02:29:48,047 --> 02:29:49,870
TRAVIS: We have two of its eyes.

4504
02:29:49,870 --> 02:29:51,083
MATT: It's now its turn.

4505
02:29:51,083 --> 02:29:52,556
LAURA: Ugh, it's still alive.

4506
02:29:52,556 --> 02:29:56,073
MATT: It turns and runs past,

4507
02:29:56,073 --> 02:29:58,734
to the one who shot it
with the angry lightning bolt.

4508
02:29:58,734 --> 02:30:00,322
(Travis laughs)

4509
02:30:00,552 --> 02:30:03,529
MATT: The tiny gnome that now
is a delicious morsel

4510
02:30:03,529 --> 02:30:05,178
in the mandibles of an umber hulk.

4511
02:30:05,178 --> 02:30:08,588
It comes running forward
like a giant armored gorilla. (grunts)

4512
02:30:09,969 --> 02:30:10,751
LAURA: Oh, no.

4513
02:30:10,751 --> 02:30:12,928
MATT: Reaching back with both of its claws,

4514
02:30:12,928 --> 02:30:15,809
swiping at you Scanlan,
that is a 23 to hit.

4515
02:30:15,809 --> 02:30:16,642
SAM: Oh, yeah.

4516
02:30:16,642 --> 02:30:17,495
MATT: 25 to hit.

4517
02:30:17,495 --> 02:30:19,430
MATT: Its mandibles are 24 to hit.

4518
02:30:19,430 --> 02:30:20,784
SAM: That hits three times.

4519
02:30:20,984 --> 02:30:22,043
MATT: Yep.

4520
02:30:22,043 --> 02:30:23,043
You take 13--

4521
02:30:24,346 --> 02:30:25,179
LAURA: Oh, no!

4522
02:30:26,608 --> 02:30:28,021
LIAM: But you're so little.

4523
02:30:28,021 --> 02:30:28,854
MATT: 24.

4524
02:30:28,854 --> 02:30:29,687
SAM: Ooh!

4525
02:30:33,248 --> 02:30:35,506
MATT: 38 points of slashing damage.

4526
02:30:35,506 --> 02:30:37,260
This is the sound I make.

4527
02:30:37,260 --> 02:30:38,597
(high-pitched wail)

4528
02:30:38,597 --> 02:30:39,849
(group laughs)

4529
02:30:39,849 --> 02:30:42,262
MATT: As it just strikes you,
all of its form now,

4530
02:30:42,262 --> 02:30:44,688
you're almost pinned to the ground,

4531
02:30:44,688 --> 02:30:47,491
blood oozing from your face
as gashes, slash wounds

4532
02:30:47,491 --> 02:30:48,990
are across your entire body.

4533
02:30:48,990 --> 02:30:50,273
It's looming over you, ready to try

4534
02:30:50,273 --> 02:30:52,042
and finish you off next round.

4535
02:30:52,042 --> 02:30:52,875
LAURA: Ugh!

4536
02:30:53,745 --> 02:30:55,637
MATT: That brings us to Vax.

4537
02:30:55,637 --> 02:30:56,470
LIAM: Okay.

4538
02:30:56,470 --> 02:30:58,629
So, he's now got his back turned to me.

4539
02:30:58,629 --> 02:31:01,237
I'm just gonna stick both
knives into his guts and say,

4540
02:31:01,237 --> 02:31:02,847
"No one touches the gnome!"

4541
02:31:02,847 --> 02:31:05,937
LIAM: Right in his guts, that's shit.

4542
02:31:05,937 --> 02:31:06,921
So, fuck that.

4543
02:31:06,921 --> 02:31:09,129
And this one is way better.

4544
02:31:09,129 --> 02:31:10,647
So that's 27.

4545
02:31:10,647 --> 02:31:12,384
MATT: 27 hits definitely.

4546
02:31:12,384 --> 02:31:14,403
LIAM: Okay, this is the flametongue.

4547
02:31:14,403 --> 02:31:16,506
MATT: It is considered flanking,
because Scanlan is there.

4548
02:31:16,506 --> 02:31:17,809
Oh yes.

4549
02:31:17,809 --> 02:31:20,388
LIAM: Four plus two is six.

4550
02:31:20,388 --> 02:31:23,349
(Sam sings along with dramatic music)

4551
02:31:23,349 --> 02:31:26,349
LIAM: Two, three, fuck, four, fuck, seven,

4552
02:31:28,639 --> 02:31:32,532
nine, 18, 24 damage.

4553
02:31:32,532 --> 02:31:35,259
With the second knife, sneak
attack into his ball sack.

4554
02:31:36,092 --> 02:31:38,365
MATT: How do you want to do this?

4555
02:31:38,365 --> 02:31:39,779
(group yells triumphantly)

4556
02:31:40,636 --> 02:31:43,312
LIAM: I stick it in the back
of his his spider nads.

4557
02:31:43,312 --> 02:31:46,814
And rip it out his bum
and out the back of him.

4558
02:31:46,814 --> 02:31:47,677
LAURA: Gross!

4559
02:31:47,677 --> 02:31:49,860
LIAM: And just spill it all out the bottom.

4560
02:31:49,863 --> 02:31:51,088
(all talking at once)

4561
02:31:51,088 --> 02:31:53,154
SAM: I'm right next to him,
it might spill on me.

4562
02:31:53,154 --> 02:31:54,608
LIAM: That's all right, 
that's all right.

4563
02:31:54,608 --> 02:31:57,072
MATT: As it's looming over
Scanlan who's on his back,

4564
02:31:57,072 --> 02:31:59,285
it's tearing into him and
starting to gut him best it can.

4565
02:31:59,285 --> 02:32:00,707
He's screaming from beneath.

4566
02:32:00,707 --> 02:32:03,654
You rush underneath, tumble,
bringing your dagger up

4567
02:32:03,654 --> 02:32:05,852
and slam it right under
the bottom of its abdomen.

4568
02:32:05,852 --> 02:32:06,685
LAURA: Balls.

4569
02:32:06,685 --> 02:32:09,231
MATT: As you do it, (snarls),
looks down towards you

4570
02:32:09,231 --> 02:32:11,255
and right before its gaze can meet yours,

4571
02:32:11,258 --> 02:32:13,591
you yank back with all your might,

4572
02:32:13,591 --> 02:32:15,770
basically scissoring and
jagged drawing the blade

4573
02:32:15,770 --> 02:32:17,033
up the back of its body.

4574
02:32:17,033 --> 02:32:19,128
As you do it, (imitates vomiting)

4575
02:32:19,128 --> 02:32:20,393
leaps forward.

4576
02:32:20,393 --> 02:32:22,232
It's now-soft torso and belly left open

4577
02:32:22,232 --> 02:32:24,080
from the armor plates being shot off,

4578
02:32:24,080 --> 02:32:26,339
spills a number of its warm innards

4579
02:32:26,339 --> 02:32:28,519
right onto Scanlan's body and form.

4580
02:32:28,519 --> 02:32:29,674
SAM: Ugh, no!

4581
02:32:29,674 --> 02:32:31,103
It went in my mouth!

4582
02:32:31,103 --> 02:32:33,130
(Travis laughs)

4583
02:32:33,130 --> 02:32:34,667
MATT: And then it collapses on top of him..

4584
02:32:34,667 --> 02:32:35,625
SAM: Ah!

4585
02:32:35,625 --> 02:32:37,850
(group laughs)

4586
02:32:37,850 --> 02:32:41,860
MATT: You take six points of crushing damage

4587
02:32:41,860 --> 02:32:43,988
as the umber hulk collapses on top of you.

4588
02:32:43,988 --> 02:32:47,783
TRAVIS: I run over and shove the
umber hulk off of Scanlan.

4589
02:32:47,783 --> 02:32:49,087
MATT: Okay.

4590
02:32:49,087 --> 02:32:50,017
SAM: Ugh! Ah!

4591
02:32:50,892 --> 02:32:51,875
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

4592
02:32:51,875 --> 02:32:53,896
SAM: What just happened?

4593
02:32:53,896 --> 02:32:56,096
MARISHA: I go over to Scanlan, and I just,

4594
02:32:56,096 --> 02:32:58,016
I just lay my hands on him,

4595
02:32:58,016 --> 02:33:01,306
and I cast Cure Wounds in a level 2 spot.

4596
02:33:01,306 --> 02:33:03,209
LIAM: Nobody touches my man-wife.

4597
02:33:03,209 --> 02:33:05,181
(group laughs)

4598
02:33:05,181 --> 02:33:07,133
SAM: What's that spell do?

4599
02:33:07,133 --> 02:33:10,050
MARISHA: You do-- it's 2d8 plus 10 healing.

4600
02:33:11,556 --> 02:33:12,601
SAM: You roll, right?

4601
02:33:12,601 --> 02:33:13,434
TALIESIN: Yep.

4602
02:33:13,434 --> 02:33:15,167
MARISHA: Do I roll or does he?

4603
02:33:15,167 --> 02:33:16,583
MATT: For which spell is this?

4604
02:33:16,583 --> 02:33:18,276
MARISHA: I'm doing Cure Wounds on him.
At level two.

4605
02:33:18,276 --> 02:33:20,215
MATT: Cure Wounds, level two?
2d8 plus five.

4606
02:33:20,215 --> 02:33:21,288
MARISHA: Do I roll?

4607
02:33:21,288 --> 02:33:22,558
MATT: You roll.

4608
02:33:22,558 --> 02:33:24,975
MARISHA: So you heal, 16, 20 points.

4609
02:33:26,064 --> 02:33:27,064
SAM: Thank you.

4610
02:33:29,468 --> 02:33:33,184
MATT: So, as you heal him,
touch him with the spell,

4611
02:33:33,184 --> 02:33:35,829
you wipe the umber
hulk ichor off of your hand.

4612
02:33:35,829 --> 02:33:38,756
ORION: I cast prestidigitation
and clean everybody up.

4613
02:33:38,756 --> 02:33:41,200
LAURA: Maybe you should jump
in that water, Scanlan.

4614
02:33:41,200 --> 02:33:43,092
TRAVIS: You should get in the water
and clean yourself off.

4615
02:33:43,092 --> 02:33:44,914
TALIESIN: We have running water.
Use running water.

4616
02:33:44,914 --> 02:33:46,458
SAM: I think I wanna keep it on.

4617
02:33:46,458 --> 02:33:47,452
(group laughs)

4618
02:33:47,452 --> 02:33:48,604
ORION: He's clean already.

4619
02:33:48,604 --> 02:33:50,377
TRAVIS: As a badge of honor?

4620
02:33:50,377 --> 02:33:51,874
SAM: It's a badge of honor.

4621
02:33:51,874 --> 02:33:54,531
LIAM: Like the walking dead, 
you're gonna sneak by the rest of 'em?

4622
02:33:54,531 --> 02:33:56,604
SAM: I think I'm gonna keep the blood on me,
if you don't mind.

4623
02:33:57,520 --> 02:33:58,353
LAURA: Alright.

4624
02:33:58,353 --> 02:33:59,520
MATT: That's, uh... okay.

4625
02:33:59,520 --> 02:34:00,353
TRAVIS: Gross.

4626
02:34:00,353 --> 02:34:02,742
SAM: Warning to others.

4627
02:34:02,742 --> 02:34:03,575
MARISHA: Yeah.

4628
02:34:03,575 --> 02:34:06,317
MATT: So, you still hear the rushing
of the water down below.

4629
02:34:06,317 --> 02:34:09,865
You now stand at this
portion of the cavern,

4630
02:34:09,865 --> 02:34:12,698
the dull glow in the distance
of some sort of light source

4631
02:34:12,698 --> 02:34:14,107
in that direction.

4632
02:34:14,107 --> 02:34:16,159
The rest of the caverns opens up this way.

4633
02:34:16,159 --> 02:34:17,023
LAURA: Ugh.

4634
02:34:17,023 --> 02:34:18,666
TRAVIS: Let's go towards the light.

4635
02:34:18,666 --> 02:34:20,677
SAM: Can we take a short rest and heal up?

4636
02:34:20,677 --> 02:34:21,593
TRAVIS: No, I run.

4637
02:34:21,593 --> 02:34:23,056
LAURA: Short rest, short rest.

4638
02:34:23,056 --> 02:34:24,084
TRAVIS: No, running.

4639
02:34:24,084 --> 02:34:25,505
LIAM: Running?!

4640
02:34:25,505 --> 02:34:26,338
(Sam laughs)

4641
02:34:26,338 --> 02:34:27,171
SAM: Why don't you let some people heal?

4642
02:34:27,171 --> 02:34:28,004
MATT: Grog goes running.

4643
02:34:28,004 --> 02:34:28,837
Grog, who's interested.

4644
02:34:28,837 --> 02:34:30,172
TRAVIS: I'm frenzy raging.

4645
02:34:30,172 --> 02:34:31,005
SAM: Oh God, Grog!

4646
02:34:31,005 --> 02:34:32,030
Grog, no!

4647
02:34:32,030 --> 02:34:33,432
TRAVIS: It's a bright, shiny thing.
I'm going there!

4648
02:34:33,432 --> 02:34:34,597
LAURA: He is frenzying.

4649
02:34:34,597 --> 02:34:36,527
LIAM: I'm unscathed, so I run after Grog,

4650
02:34:36,527 --> 02:34:38,326
just to give him backup if he needs.

4651
02:34:38,326 --> 02:34:40,606
MARISHA: I'll follow after Vax.

4652
02:34:40,606 --> 02:34:42,296
MATT: All right, you guys head out.

4653
02:34:42,296 --> 02:34:43,578
Eventually, you come
around the corner to see

4654
02:34:43,578 --> 02:34:44,411
what looks like a campfire.

4655
02:34:44,411 --> 02:34:45,933
ORION: I follow as well.

4656
02:34:45,933 --> 02:34:46,766
TRAVIS: Aww.

4657
02:34:46,766 --> 02:34:49,739
MATT: It looks like a setup
with a small bundle of,

4658
02:34:49,739 --> 02:34:51,250
what looks like bedding.

4659
02:34:51,250 --> 02:34:52,873
There's a campfire set up.

4660
02:34:52,873 --> 02:34:54,867
It's mostly out at this point.

4661
02:34:54,867 --> 02:34:57,427
Like there's still a little
bit of a flame flicker

4662
02:34:57,427 --> 02:35:00,086
to it, but it's just
embers for the most part.

4663
02:35:00,916 --> 02:35:01,749
Does not appear--

4664
02:35:01,749 --> 02:35:03,671
TRAVIS: I start hacking away at the bedding.

4665
02:35:03,671 --> 02:35:05,454
Just chopping the shit out of it.

4666
02:35:05,454 --> 02:35:06,406
SAM: Jesus!

4667
02:35:06,406 --> 02:35:07,999
(group laughs)

4668
02:35:09,310 --> 02:35:11,710
MATT: Grog starts hacking away 
at the bedding.

4669
02:35:11,710 --> 02:35:13,684
(Travis grunts)

4670
02:35:13,684 --> 02:35:15,296
LIAM: I'm just watching and shrugging.

4671
02:35:15,296 --> 02:35:18,422
LAURA: No, look and search around
and see what's in the bedding.

4672
02:35:18,422 --> 02:35:19,662
LIAM: I try to keep like six or
seven foot difference--

4673
02:35:19,662 --> 02:35:20,747
MATT: (arrows whooshing)

4674
02:35:20,747 --> 02:35:21,580
SAM: Oh, no!

4675
02:35:21,580 --> 02:35:22,413
LIAM: Fuck!

4676
02:35:22,413 --> 02:35:24,403
MATT: Three crossbow bolts come
flying out of nowhere--

4677
02:35:24,403 --> 02:35:25,236
LIAM: You dick!

4678
02:35:25,236 --> 02:35:26,509
MATT: --two hitting Grog.

4679
02:35:26,509 --> 02:35:27,342
LIAM: You dick!

4680
02:35:27,342 --> 02:35:28,167
(Marisha laughs)

4681
02:35:28,167 --> 02:35:30,488
LAURA: Why weren't you stealthing?

4682
02:35:30,488 --> 02:35:31,321
LIAM: I am now.

4683
02:35:31,321 --> 02:35:34,213
TRAVIS: Somebody likes their bedding apparently.

4684
02:35:34,213 --> 02:35:37,585
LIAM: I rolled a 29 of stealth as
soon as the first arrow flew.

4685
02:35:37,585 --> 02:35:40,580
MARISHA: That was a Coleman, alright?

4686
02:35:40,580 --> 02:35:41,799
(group laughs)

4687
02:35:41,799 --> 02:35:43,220
That was a very expensive sleeping bag.

4688
02:35:43,220 --> 02:35:45,197
TALIESIN: Never attack the bedding before
you know the thread count.

4689
02:35:45,197 --> 02:35:46,704
TRAVIS: It was 3000 count Egyptian.

4690
02:35:46,704 --> 02:35:47,438
TALIESIN: God.

4691
02:35:47,438 --> 02:35:50,259
MATT: Grog, you take seven
points of piercing damage,

4692
02:35:50,259 --> 02:35:52,563
which is halved to four
because you're raging.

4693
02:35:52,563 --> 02:35:53,836
TRAVIS: Right. (grunts)

4694
02:35:56,984 --> 02:36:01,456
MATT: As you can see 
what looks like three small--

4695
02:36:01,792 --> 02:36:03,310
LIAM: Duergar.

4696
02:36:03,310 --> 02:36:04,695
LAURA: No, they're dwarves.

4697
02:36:04,695 --> 02:36:06,044
LIAM: Yeah, that's duergar.

4698
02:36:06,044 --> 02:36:07,603
That's dark dwarves.

4699
02:36:07,603 --> 02:36:08,507
LAURA: Oh!

4700
02:36:08,507 --> 02:36:10,556
LIAM: I consider myself a nerd.

4701
02:36:10,556 --> 02:36:14,473
MATT: And some strange beast
you've not seen before

4702
02:36:14,871 --> 02:36:16,753
seems to be accompanying one of them.

4703
02:36:16,753 --> 02:36:18,029
LAURA: Is that a brain?

4704
02:36:18,029 --> 02:36:21,695
MATT: It looks like an oversized, swollen brain
with a set of claws.

4705
02:36:21,695 --> 02:36:22,911
LIAM: It's hanging brain.

4706
02:36:22,911 --> 02:36:24,085
SAM: Krang?

4707
02:36:24,085 --> 02:36:24,918
MARISHA: Brain?

4708
02:36:24,918 --> 02:36:28,412
MATT: It's just like a large brain
with a set of arms and legs

4709
02:36:28,412 --> 02:36:29,190
like a panther.

4710
02:36:29,190 --> 02:36:30,023
LAURA: What?

4711
02:36:30,023 --> 02:36:32,176
TRAVIS: It's the brain bug from Starship Troopers.

4712
02:36:32,176 --> 02:36:33,773
MARISHA: That can't be good.

4713
02:36:33,773 --> 02:36:34,845
ORION: Take that out first.

4714
02:36:34,845 --> 02:36:37,152
MATT: Going off the same intiative order.

4715
02:36:37,152 --> 02:36:38,647
They've gone.

4716
02:36:38,647 --> 02:36:40,618
LIAM: I rolled a 29 stealth.

4717
02:36:40,618 --> 02:36:41,451
MATT: Yes, I know.

4718
02:36:41,451 --> 02:36:43,607
So you haven't been seen, and
you have the first action.

4719
02:36:43,607 --> 02:36:45,723
TRAVIS: Are they on the same level as us?

4720
02:36:45,723 --> 02:36:47,056
MATT: They are, yes.

4721
02:36:47,056 --> 02:36:49,107
LIAM: So I can dash and still attack?

4722
02:36:49,107 --> 02:36:50,289
MATT: If you'd like to.

4723
02:36:50,289 --> 02:36:51,652
LIAM: I would love to.

4724
02:36:51,652 --> 02:36:52,915
I would love to, uh--

4725
02:36:52,915 --> 02:36:53,748
where's this thing?

4726
02:36:53,748 --> 02:36:54,781
LAURA: Go for the brain.

4727
02:36:54,781 --> 02:36:56,254
LIAM: Yeah, of course
go for the brain.

4728
02:36:56,254 --> 02:36:57,080
I'm gonna hang brain.

4729
02:36:57,080 --> 02:36:57,913
I'm gonna run over--

4730
02:36:57,913 --> 02:36:59,593
MATT: Well if you dash as your action--

4731
02:36:59,593 --> 02:37:00,608
LIAM: Oh, I can't stealth?

4732
02:37:00,608 --> 02:37:02,829
So to stay stealth, I
need to go normal speed?

4733
02:37:02,829 --> 02:37:04,471
MATT: Well you can dash as your action,

4734
02:37:04,471 --> 02:37:06,697
but dash is your, basically a double move.

4735
02:37:06,697 --> 02:37:09,148
So you move and use your
action to move as well.

4736
02:37:09,148 --> 02:37:10,431
LIAM: And that's it.

4737
02:37:10,431 --> 02:37:11,887
MATT: That's all you'll be able to do.

4738
02:37:11,887 --> 02:37:14,746
LIAM: Um, I'm gonna-- no.
I'll you what I'm gonna do.

4739
02:37:14,746 --> 02:37:17,386
I'm gonna go-- hey, god.

4740
02:37:17,386 --> 02:37:19,544
I'm gonna move over here, stealthily.

4741
02:37:19,544 --> 02:37:21,525
And go for ready.

4742
02:37:21,525 --> 02:37:22,358
MATT: Okay.

4743
02:37:22,358 --> 02:37:23,191
LIAM: That's what it's called, right?

4744
02:37:23,191 --> 02:37:24,024
And wait?

4745
02:37:24,024 --> 02:37:24,857
MATT: Just wait.

4746
02:37:24,857 --> 02:37:27,031
LIAM: And the trigger is
when this asshole duergar

4747
02:37:27,031 --> 02:37:29,440
moves forward, I'm gonna stick
him in the back of the neck.

4748
02:37:29,440 --> 02:37:30,772
MATT: Okay. All right.

4749
02:37:31,605 --> 02:37:32,541
MARISHA: Nice.

4750
02:37:32,541 --> 02:37:33,458
MATT: Tiberius.

4751
02:37:34,862 --> 02:37:37,112
You hear Grog go, "Ugh!"

4752
02:37:38,779 --> 02:37:41,162
ORION: Oh, it seems like there's
trouble over there.

4753
02:37:41,162 --> 02:37:43,779
(group laughs)

4754
02:37:43,779 --> 02:37:45,642
What has Grog gotten himself into?

4755
02:37:45,642 --> 02:37:46,775
MARISHA: I don't know.

4756
02:37:46,775 --> 02:37:49,193
(Travis moans and strangles)

4757
02:37:49,193 --> 02:37:50,736
ORION: I saunter--

4758
02:37:50,736 --> 02:37:51,569
TRAVIS: You saunter?

4759
02:37:51,569 --> 02:37:52,500
SAM: Saunter.

4760
02:37:52,500 --> 02:37:53,333
ORION: Yes.

4761
02:37:53,333 --> 02:37:55,106
MATT: You jump off your pillar.

4762
02:37:55,106 --> 02:37:56,189
ORION: Oh.

4763
02:37:57,764 --> 02:37:59,119
MATT: Saunter over here?

4764
02:37:59,119 --> 02:38:00,263
ORION: Yeah, I would go around there to--

4765
02:38:00,263 --> 02:38:02,180
That's good, I suppose.

4766
02:38:03,108 --> 02:38:05,300
What's in between the--

4767
02:38:05,300 --> 02:38:06,647
between him and that.

4768
02:38:06,647 --> 02:38:07,718
Is that a boulder?

4769
02:38:07,718 --> 02:38:10,468
MATT: It's a giant raised stalagmite.

4770
02:38:11,915 --> 02:38:13,538
ORION: I see, how tall is that?

4771
02:38:13,538 --> 02:38:15,292
MATT: It's about 25 feet tall.

4772
02:38:15,292 --> 02:38:16,125
ORION: Oh crap, okay.

4773
02:38:16,125 --> 02:38:17,448
MATT: All you see is Grog standing
with three bolts

4774
02:38:17,448 --> 02:38:19,124
sticking out of his chest now.

4775
02:38:19,124 --> 02:38:20,769
LAURA: Oh no!

4776
02:38:20,769 --> 02:38:22,975
(Travis imitates wood breaking)

4777
02:38:22,975 --> 02:38:25,558
ORION: I can't do anything too much.

4778
02:38:25,947 --> 02:38:27,660
LIAM: Grog, I've got the hiccups.

4779
02:38:27,660 --> 02:38:29,173
MATT: Anything else, Tiberius?

4780
02:38:29,173 --> 02:38:30,356
Gotta keep this moving.

4781
02:38:30,356 --> 02:38:31,189
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4782
02:38:31,189 --> 02:38:32,022
LIAM: The bolts.

4783
02:38:32,022 --> 02:38:32,855
TRAVIS: Right.

4784
02:38:33,587 --> 02:38:36,334
ORION: I'll just cast stoneskin on myself.

4785
02:38:36,334 --> 02:38:38,102
Okay, Stoneskin cast on you.

4786
02:38:38,102 --> 02:38:39,869
That brings us to Vex.

4787
02:38:39,869 --> 02:38:43,545
LAURA: All right, I can hear them
screaming so I'm gonna run over.

4788
02:38:43,545 --> 02:38:46,343
Call Trinket as I'm doing it.

4789
02:38:46,343 --> 02:38:47,607
TRAVIS: Who's screaming?

4790
02:38:47,607 --> 02:38:48,839
LAURA: You, you screamed.

4791
02:38:48,839 --> 02:38:49,827
TRAVIS: No, I'm not screaming.

4792
02:38:49,827 --> 02:38:52,086
MATT: Do you want to use 
your full round to move?

4793
02:38:52,086 --> 02:38:54,308
Cause that's as far as
you can move currently.

4794
02:38:54,308 --> 02:38:55,719
Actually you can move two more.

4795
02:38:55,719 --> 02:38:57,126
LAURA: Can I see anything from that point?

4796
02:38:57,126 --> 02:38:59,080
MATT: All you see is Grog over there.

4797
02:38:59,080 --> 02:39:00,509
LIAM: They're covered
and he's around the bend,

4798
02:39:00,509 --> 02:39:02,521
so I'd run in further.

4799
02:39:02,521 --> 02:39:04,415
LAURA: All right, I'll run in further.

4800
02:39:04,415 --> 02:39:06,360
Can I run in and stealth or is that it?

4801
02:39:06,360 --> 02:39:07,819
MATT: Uh, you can attempt to.

4802
02:39:07,819 --> 02:39:09,358
LAURA: I'm gonna try to stealth
as I'm going in.

4803
02:39:09,358 --> 02:39:11,168
MATT: You're at disadvantage
on the stealth roll,

4804
02:39:11,168 --> 02:39:13,089
but go for it.

4805
02:39:13,089 --> 02:39:14,490
LAURA: Oh, a 20.

4806
02:39:14,490 --> 02:39:15,669
Aw!

4807
02:39:15,669 --> 02:39:16,502
17, okay.

4808
02:39:16,502 --> 02:39:18,533
Plus my stealth, which is five.

4809
02:39:18,533 --> 02:39:20,588
MATT: All right, so we'll say
you're pulled off

4810
02:39:20,588 --> 02:39:21,488
to the side there.

4811
02:39:21,488 --> 02:39:23,929
The stealth twins over there
being all stealthy-like.

4812
02:39:23,929 --> 02:39:25,419
No one can see what's going on with them.

4813
02:39:25,419 --> 02:39:26,555
It's like they're related.

4814
02:39:26,555 --> 02:39:27,738
TRAVIS: What's all this stealthing?

4815
02:39:27,738 --> 02:39:28,824
Where's all the killing?

4816
02:39:28,824 --> 02:39:29,657
MATT: That's your turn.

4817
02:39:29,657 --> 02:39:30,850
LAURA: I can't attack anything.

4818
02:39:30,850 --> 02:39:31,663
MATT: Scanlan.

4819
02:39:31,663 --> 02:39:33,226
SAM: Okay, I'm gonna move right there

4820
02:39:33,226 --> 02:39:34,679
into the room as far as I can.

4821
02:39:34,679 --> 02:39:35,957
MATT: You can go that far.

4822
02:39:35,957 --> 02:39:37,747
SAM: Okay.

4823
02:39:37,747 --> 02:39:41,240
And cast Stinking Cloud right there.

4824
02:39:41,240 --> 02:39:43,237
(Travis laughs)

4825
02:39:43,237 --> 02:39:45,810
It's gonna smell like just ass over there.

4826
02:39:45,810 --> 02:39:48,221
(group laughs)

4827
02:39:48,221 --> 02:39:49,054
MATT: Okay.

4828
02:39:49,054 --> 02:39:51,449
Best you can see, and
you haven't really seen

4829
02:39:51,449 --> 02:39:53,731
where they are, so
you're kind of like, oh,

4830
02:39:53,731 --> 02:39:56,548
you have the idea that perhaps
they're over in that vicinity

4831
02:39:56,548 --> 02:39:58,144
on the bolts around there.

4832
02:39:58,144 --> 02:40:00,283
So you can cast over in this
area, which is the only thing

4833
02:40:00,283 --> 02:40:01,116
you have view of.

4834
02:40:01,116 --> 02:40:02,714
SAM: Oh, oh, because that's
a big rock in my view there.

4835
02:40:02,714 --> 02:40:03,547
MATT: This is a big rock right there, yeah.

4836
02:40:03,547 --> 02:40:04,380
SAM: Okay, so yeah.

4837
02:40:04,380 --> 02:40:06,839
I'll put it right where you're
saying, right there, yeah.

4838
02:40:06,839 --> 02:40:07,745
MATT: Okay, that's about where you can go.

4839
02:40:07,745 --> 02:40:09,723
All right, so (hisses),

4840
02:40:09,723 --> 02:40:10,796
a giant--

4841
02:40:10,796 --> 02:40:11,629
TRAVIS: Ass cloud.

4842
02:40:11,629 --> 02:40:13,679
MATT: --green, ass cloud--

4843
02:40:13,679 --> 02:40:17,076
ORION: Scanlan, are you
doing an ass cloud again?

4844
02:40:17,076 --> 02:40:20,249
MATT: --begins to fill this space here.

4845
02:40:20,249 --> 02:40:23,566
As it does, they all
begin to hack and cough.

4846
02:40:23,566 --> 02:40:25,983
You can hear this now
between the rest of you,

4847
02:40:25,983 --> 02:40:27,174
echoing throughout.

4848
02:40:27,174 --> 02:40:28,655
TRAVIS: I'm slightly aroused.

4849
02:40:28,655 --> 02:40:29,488
(group laughs)

4850
02:40:29,488 --> 02:40:30,808
ORION: I was just going to say.

4851
02:40:31,734 --> 02:40:33,629
TRAVIS: I'm drawn to the smell.

4852
02:40:33,629 --> 02:40:35,477
SAM: (imitates flute) --stinks.

4853
02:40:35,477 --> 02:40:38,562
MATT: ♫ Constitution saving throws.
Everything in the cloud. ♫

4854
02:40:38,562 --> 02:40:40,638
SAM: (imitates flute) --stink.

4855
02:40:40,638 --> 02:40:42,900
MATT: ♫ All them are failing. ♫

4856
02:40:42,900 --> 02:40:44,383
ORION: Doing stink magic.

4857
02:40:45,216 --> 02:40:49,875
MATT: All right. You hear a cacophonous
amount of hacking, coughing,

4858
02:40:49,875 --> 02:40:52,644
as all of them drop their attack stances

4859
02:40:52,644 --> 02:40:54,953
and begin just retching, nearly vomiting,

4860
02:40:54,953 --> 02:40:57,720
in the middle of this green cloud of gas.

4861
02:40:57,720 --> 02:40:58,887
TRAVIS: Outstanding.

4862
02:41:00,111 --> 02:41:02,426
SAM: I'll also take a great heal potion?

4863
02:41:02,426 --> 02:41:03,259
Is that what they're called?

4864
02:41:03,259 --> 02:41:04,092
Not moderate.

4865
02:41:04,092 --> 02:41:04,925
MATT: Yes, greater.

4866
02:41:04,925 --> 02:41:05,758
SAM: Great, greater, okay.

4867
02:41:05,758 --> 02:41:06,591
I'll do that by myself.

4868
02:41:06,591 --> 02:41:07,551
You keep going.

4869
02:41:07,551 --> 02:41:11,248
MATT: Okay, greater heal
potion is 4d4 plus four.

4870
02:41:11,248 --> 02:41:12,941
SAM: Thank you.

4871
02:41:12,941 --> 02:41:16,107
MATT: All right, that brings us to Percy.

4872
02:41:16,107 --> 02:41:18,045
TALIESIN: I'm going to start
crawling around the--

4873
02:41:18,045 --> 02:41:18,942
I have a little thingy.

4874
02:41:18,942 --> 02:41:20,113
Someone took the thingy.

4875
02:41:20,113 --> 02:41:21,151
Oh, laser pointer.

4876
02:41:21,151 --> 02:41:22,243
Thank you.

4877
02:41:22,243 --> 02:41:23,538
LIAM: Hello, hey.

4878
02:41:23,538 --> 02:41:24,789
TRAVIS: It's a black light.

4879
02:41:24,789 --> 02:41:29,046
TALIESIN: I'm gonna start heading
down this direction,

4880
02:41:29,046 --> 02:41:31,256
and I'm going to actually
spend a movement,

4881
02:41:31,256 --> 02:41:33,612
spend my action and move
a little further down,

4882
02:41:33,612 --> 02:41:35,315
about, yeah, about there,

4883
02:41:35,315 --> 02:41:37,715
so I can start getting
a good look of what's up.

4884
02:41:37,715 --> 02:41:39,005
MATT: Okay, good.

4885
02:41:39,005 --> 02:41:40,876
All right. That brings us to Keyleth.

4886
02:41:40,876 --> 02:41:44,170
MARISHA: Okay, so I am going to take this

4887
02:41:44,763 --> 02:41:47,680
and move up to about here, I guess.

4888
02:41:50,666 --> 02:41:51,499
MATT: Okay.

4889
02:41:51,499 --> 02:41:52,854
MARISHA: Is where I can see.

4890
02:41:52,854 --> 02:41:55,333
And then I'm gonna
take this little block

4891
02:41:55,333 --> 02:41:58,175
of stone right here, this stalagtite

4892
02:41:58,175 --> 02:41:59,854
or mite or whatever it is--

4893
02:41:59,854 --> 02:42:00,687
MATT: Correct.

4894
02:42:00,687 --> 02:42:03,312
MARISHA: --and I'm gonna use Wall of Stone.

4895
02:42:03,312 --> 02:42:06,113
And instead of creating a wall,
I'm just gonna take that one

4896
02:42:06,113 --> 02:42:08,170
and I'm gonna push it (imitates thudding)

4897
02:42:08,170 --> 02:42:10,186
against that wall and
try and crush those guys.

4898
02:42:10,186 --> 02:42:11,019
TRAVIS: Whoa!

4899
02:42:11,019 --> 02:42:11,852
MATT: Wait, you're gonna use
Wall of Stone to try

4900
02:42:11,852 --> 02:42:12,778
and push that back?

4901
02:42:12,778 --> 02:42:13,827
MARISHA: I'm gonna take this wall,

4902
02:42:13,827 --> 02:42:15,934
and I'm gonna go crunch.

4903
02:42:15,934 --> 02:42:16,895
MATT: All right.

4904
02:42:16,895 --> 02:42:17,786
SAM: Oh my God.

4905
02:42:17,786 --> 02:42:18,619
TRAVIS: Can you do that?

4906
02:42:18,619 --> 02:42:19,452
TALIESIN: That's kinda harsh.

4907
02:42:19,452 --> 02:42:20,285
MARISHA: I don't know.

4908
02:42:20,285 --> 02:42:21,118
We'll find out.

4909
02:42:21,118 --> 02:42:22,064
LAURA: I like that that's the most 
common quip.

4910
02:42:22,064 --> 02:42:23,097
"Can, can you do that?"

4911
02:42:23,097 --> 02:42:24,592
SAM: You can actually do that?

4912
02:42:24,592 --> 02:42:25,675
ORION: It's like earthbending.

4913
02:42:25,676 --> 02:42:27,169
MARISHA: I'm trying to earthbend this wall.

4914
02:42:27,169 --> 02:42:29,262
SAM: Hey Grog. Did you ever write down
our underwater spell,

4915
02:42:29,262 --> 02:42:31,806
potion thingies, whatever
those were called?

4916
02:42:31,806 --> 02:42:32,639
TRAVIS: We got two of 'em.

4917
02:42:32,639 --> 02:42:33,621
SAM: Yeah, did you right it down, though?

4918
02:42:33,621 --> 02:42:34,454
'Cause I didn't.

4919
02:42:34,454 --> 02:42:35,287
TRAVIS: What they were?

4920
02:42:35,287 --> 02:42:36,902
TALIESIN: She's got waterbreathing, so.

4921
02:42:36,902 --> 02:42:38,590
MATT: So how it works is, Wall of Stone,

4922
02:42:38,590 --> 02:42:40,257
you can create a wall
of stone, but it cannot

4923
02:42:40,257 --> 02:42:43,041
occupy the space of a creature.

4924
02:42:43,041 --> 02:42:45,034
So you will not be able to
push them back, unfortunately.

4925
02:42:45,034 --> 02:42:46,912
But you could lock them into an area,

4926
02:42:46,912 --> 02:42:48,714
if that's what you wanted to do.

4927
02:42:48,714 --> 02:42:50,830
SAM: The man telling us what
we can and can't do.

4928
02:42:50,830 --> 02:42:53,288
(group laughs)

4929
02:42:53,288 --> 02:42:55,512
MATT: It's the nature of the spell, guys.

4930
02:42:55,512 --> 02:42:57,528
MARISHA: Yeah, that's a waste of time.

4931
02:42:57,528 --> 02:42:58,861
Instead, I will--

4932
02:43:01,986 --> 02:43:03,897
I still got a Call Lightning going.

4933
02:43:03,897 --> 02:43:04,730
Fuck it.

4934
02:43:04,730 --> 02:43:06,749
I'm just gonna lightning
bolt some bitches.

4935
02:43:06,749 --> 02:43:07,582
MATT: All right.

4936
02:43:07,582 --> 02:43:10,069
You don't have view of any of
them right now, unfortunately.

4937
02:43:10,069 --> 02:43:12,738
MARISHA: Well, then I move to where I can.

4938
02:43:12,738 --> 02:43:13,571
MATT: Okay.

4939
02:43:13,571 --> 02:43:14,404
SAM: Yeah good.

4940
02:43:14,404 --> 02:43:15,723
Cop attitude with the DM.

4941
02:43:15,723 --> 02:43:16,556
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah.

4942
02:43:16,556 --> 02:43:18,074
SAM: The man in charge of our fates.

4943
02:43:18,074 --> 02:43:19,876
TALIESIN: That always goes really well.

4944
02:43:19,876 --> 02:43:21,215
MATT: That'll be your turn.

4945
02:43:21,215 --> 02:43:22,490
SAM: Because of the attitude.

4946
02:43:22,490 --> 02:43:23,323
MATT: You moved twice.
You had to get a long distance.

4947
02:43:23,323 --> 02:43:24,156
MARISHA: Did I?

4948
02:43:24,156 --> 02:43:24,989
MATT: Yeah, because you were back here.

4949
02:43:24,989 --> 02:43:26,672
LAURA: Yeah, dude.
It was really far away, yo.

4950
02:43:26,672 --> 02:43:28,328
I've got a decent speed, okay, fine.
That's my turn then.

4951
02:43:28,328 --> 02:43:29,154
MATT: Sorry.

4952
02:43:29,154 --> 02:43:30,859
LIAM: Fuck those Wizards of the Coast, man!

4953
02:43:30,859 --> 02:43:32,035
I do what I wanna do.

4954
02:43:32,035 --> 02:43:33,234
MARISHA: Fucking Seattle assholes.

4955
02:43:33,234 --> 02:43:35,208
MATT: All right, so.

4956
02:43:35,208 --> 02:43:37,004
ORION: I love Seattle.

4957
02:43:37,004 --> 02:43:37,837
LIAM: So do I.

4958
02:43:38,857 --> 02:43:42,028
MATT: And what's the DC again of your spell?

4959
02:43:42,028 --> 02:43:43,005
SAM: Ah, oh.

4960
02:43:43,005 --> 02:43:44,962
SAM: Spell save DC, is that right? 19.

4961
02:43:46,628 --> 02:43:48,040
MATT: 19. All right.

4962
02:43:49,948 --> 02:43:52,896
All three of the-- and you
can now get a view of them.

4963
02:43:52,896 --> 02:43:55,839
They are dwarven, but their
skin is ashy and grey.

4964
02:43:55,839 --> 02:43:58,839
Their eyes are white and pupil-less.

4965
02:43:59,976 --> 02:44:02,546
And they are all on the
verge of vomiting right now.

4966
02:44:02,546 --> 02:44:03,931
They're both just keeling over.

4967
02:44:03,931 --> 02:44:05,412
One of them tries to bring a crossbow up,

4968
02:44:05,412 --> 02:44:08,043
and (imitates vomiting) has
to put it back down again.

4969
02:44:08,043 --> 02:44:09,650
They are unable to act this turn.

4970
02:44:09,650 --> 02:44:11,908
The weird brain creature, however--

4971
02:44:11,908 --> 02:44:12,880
MARISHA: That's awesome.

4972
02:44:12,880 --> 02:44:14,780
TRAVIS: What, has no nostrils?

4973
02:44:14,780 --> 02:44:16,522
TALIESIN: There's nowhere for him to retch from.

4974
02:44:16,522 --> 02:44:19,410
MATT: It moves out of the cloud,
looks over at you Grog.

4975
02:44:19,410 --> 02:44:20,654
SAM: Oh, no.

4976
02:44:20,654 --> 02:44:22,351
MATT: And just bears down for a second.

4977
02:44:22,351 --> 02:44:24,503
And you feel this...

4978
02:44:24,503 --> 02:44:27,102
intrusion in your mind.

4979
02:44:27,102 --> 02:44:28,891
TRAVIS: On my professor-torial mind.

4980
02:44:28,891 --> 02:44:30,591
MATT: Go ahead and make an
intelligence saving throw.

4981
02:44:30,591 --> 02:44:32,160
SAM: Oh, those aren't good for you.

4982
02:44:32,160 --> 02:44:33,034
MARISHA: Oh, no.

4983
02:44:33,034 --> 02:44:33,804
(Travis laughs)

4984
02:44:33,804 --> 02:44:35,725
TALIESIN: Well this, this ends poorly.

4985
02:44:35,725 --> 02:44:37,462
TRAVIS: Oh good, my modifier's negative 2,

4986
02:44:37,462 --> 02:44:39,129
so yippee-kye-ay-eh.

4987
02:44:40,404 --> 02:44:41,553
Six.

4988
02:44:41,553 --> 02:44:42,667
MATT: Alright.

4989
02:44:42,667 --> 02:44:43,500
ORION: Good roll.

4990
02:44:43,500 --> 02:44:44,606
TALIESIN: Good roll.

4991
02:44:44,606 --> 02:44:46,189
MARISHA: That's a good number.

4992
02:44:46,189 --> 02:44:48,582
MATT: You suffer nine points 
of psychic damage

4993
02:44:48,582 --> 02:44:50,894
as there's a sudden blast
of excruciating pain

4994
02:44:50,894 --> 02:44:52,666
in the center of your brain.

4995
02:44:52,666 --> 02:44:54,573
It actually shakes you
a moment from your rage,

4996
02:44:54,573 --> 02:44:57,448
which then fills your mind once again.

4997
02:44:57,448 --> 02:44:59,828
TRAVIS: Like Kenny G music
coming through my brain.

4998
02:44:59,828 --> 02:45:01,425
TALIESIN: Someone needs a
Juggernaut helmet.

4999
02:45:01,425 --> 02:45:02,357
MATT: Also, you suffer--

5000
02:45:02,357 --> 02:45:04,023
MARISHA: He needs a Magneto helmet.

5001
02:45:04,023 --> 02:45:05,664
TALIESIN: Yeah, he needs the full Magneto.

5002
02:45:05,664 --> 02:45:08,185
MATT: --8 points of intelligence
damage technically.

5003
02:45:08,185 --> 02:45:09,832
You immediately fall unconscious.

5004
02:45:09,832 --> 02:45:10,894
(Laura gasps)

5005
02:45:10,894 --> 02:45:11,727
MARISHA: What?!

5006
02:45:11,727 --> 02:45:12,934
MATT: Your intelligence is brought to zero.

5007
02:45:12,934 --> 02:45:13,767
TRAVIS: Ah!

5008
02:45:13,767 --> 02:45:15,508
But I was at six!

5009
02:45:15,508 --> 02:45:17,034
LIAM: You gotta kill that thing.

5010
02:45:17,034 --> 02:45:17,867
LAURA: Oh no!

5011
02:45:17,867 --> 02:45:19,331
TRAVIS: I turn into a turnip?

5012
02:45:20,922 --> 02:45:22,258
MATT: That brings us to--

5013
02:45:22,258 --> 02:45:24,132
(Matt laughs)

5014
02:45:24,132 --> 02:45:24,965
Tiberius.

5015
02:45:28,097 --> 02:45:29,805
ORION: Tiberius, I mean--

5016
02:45:29,805 --> 02:45:31,108
MATT: Yes, you're Tiberius.

5017
02:45:31,108 --> 02:45:32,312
ORION: I say--

5018
02:45:32,312 --> 02:45:34,552
MATT: You just watched Grog just go (groans)

5019
02:45:34,552 --> 02:45:36,232
and fall to the ground.

5020
02:45:36,232 --> 02:45:37,876
Almost into the campfire.

5021
02:45:37,876 --> 02:45:38,949
LAURA: Oh, no.

5022
02:45:38,949 --> 02:45:42,360
TRAVIS: It's like when I tried to read
50 Shades of Grey. (groans)

5023
02:45:44,032 --> 02:45:45,211
ORION: Okay, I'm gonna--

5024
02:45:45,211 --> 02:45:46,696
TALIESIN: Around the bear.

5025
02:45:46,696 --> 02:45:49,728
ORION: Okay, I'm gonna go
right up to where Grog is.

5026
02:45:49,728 --> 02:45:50,609
MATT: All right.

5027
02:45:50,609 --> 02:45:53,584
ORION: Right there, right in front of him.

5028
02:45:53,584 --> 02:45:55,413
Now can I see the brain fucker?

5029
02:45:55,413 --> 02:45:56,669
MATT: Yes, you can from there.

5030
02:45:56,669 --> 02:45:58,573
MARISHA: The brain fucker.

5031
02:45:58,573 --> 02:46:00,843
MATT: The brain fucker's official name.

5032
02:46:00,843 --> 02:46:01,924
TALIESIN: Brain lover, brain lover.

5033
02:46:01,924 --> 02:46:03,089
ORION: Ooh, you're a nasty one.

5034
02:46:03,089 --> 02:46:04,834
MARISHA: He's a lover, not a fighter.

5035
02:46:04,834 --> 02:46:07,996
ORION: I'm gonna fire a glacial
blast at this dude.

5036
02:46:07,996 --> 02:46:09,679
MATT: Okay. Single targeted beam.

5037
02:46:09,679 --> 02:46:10,689
TALIESIN: Lobey.

5038
02:46:10,689 --> 02:46:11,664
MARISHA: Lobey.

5039
02:46:11,664 --> 02:46:12,990
TALIESIN: We're gonna name him Lobey.

5040
02:46:12,990 --> 02:46:14,363
MARISHA: Let's call him Lobey.

5041
02:46:14,373 --> 02:46:15,112
(Laura laughs)

5042
02:46:15,112 --> 02:46:16,361
MATT: Makes its saving throw.

5043
02:46:16,361 --> 02:46:17,194
TALIESIN: "Lobey, no!"

5044
02:46:17,194 --> 02:46:19,224
MATT: What's your DC?

5045
02:46:19,224 --> 02:46:20,494
ORION: My DC is 17.

5046
02:46:20,494 --> 02:46:22,364
MATT: It just rolled a 17, yeah.
It makes the saving throw.

5047
02:46:22,364 --> 02:46:23,395
So half damage.

5048
02:46:23,395 --> 02:46:24,998
TALIESIN: Take him everywhere.

5049
02:46:24,998 --> 02:46:26,301
ORION: Four, six, and 8d6.

5050
02:46:27,491 --> 02:46:29,539
TALIESIN: Our little Lobey.

5051
02:46:30,605 --> 02:46:32,773
MARISHA: Can we call him Jeff, Jeff Lobey?

5052
02:46:32,773 --> 02:46:34,744
SAM: Is that campfire still firing?

5053
02:46:34,744 --> 02:46:36,007
TALIESIN: Jeff Lobey.

5054
02:46:36,007 --> 02:46:37,240
MATT: It's embers, yeah.

5055
02:46:37,240 --> 02:46:38,811
21, 22, 23.

5056
02:46:38,811 --> 02:46:39,909
24, 26, 27, 22.

5057
02:46:39,909 --> 02:46:41,445
29 damage.

5058
02:46:41,445 --> 02:46:42,483
MATT: 29 damage?

5059
02:46:42,483 --> 02:46:43,546
(Taliesin laughing)

5060
02:46:44,149 --> 02:46:46,352
MATT: As you put your arms out,

5061
02:46:46,352 --> 02:46:49,238
you focus this blast of just
freezing cold arcane energy

5062
02:46:49,238 --> 02:46:51,668
that slams into the side
of this brain creature.

5063
02:46:51,668 --> 02:46:53,230
TALIESIN: Jeff Lobey, thank you.

5064
02:46:53,230 --> 02:46:56,239
MATT: As it does, you see it begins
to freeze its entire body.

5065
02:46:56,239 --> 02:46:58,826
As it reaches up and tries
to climb up it solidifies

5066
02:46:58,826 --> 02:47:02,826
and then shatters into a
hundred million pieces.

5067
02:47:04,328 --> 02:47:05,161
(group cheers)

5068
02:47:05,161 --> 02:47:06,885
SAM: Oh, the brain's dead.

5069
02:47:06,885 --> 02:47:08,511
TALIESIN: You killed Jeff Lobey!

5070
02:47:08,511 --> 02:47:10,130
MARISHA: You killed Jeff Lobey.

5071
02:47:10,130 --> 02:47:11,079
SAM: Lisa Loeb?

5072
02:47:11,079 --> 02:47:12,310
MARISHA: Lisa Lobey!

5073
02:47:12,310 --> 02:47:14,017
(group laughs)

5074
02:47:14,017 --> 02:47:15,047
They just keep going!

5075
02:47:15,047 --> 02:47:18,599
MATT: Lisa Loeb and then the
nine intelligence damage.

5076
02:47:19,449 --> 02:47:20,282
All right.

5077
02:47:20,282 --> 02:47:22,400
So the brain just (imitates
shattering) cascades

5078
02:47:22,400 --> 02:47:23,481
across the ground.

5079
02:47:23,481 --> 02:47:24,545
LIAM: Lisa Lobey.

5080
02:47:24,545 --> 02:47:25,878
MATT: And thank God.

5081
02:47:25,878 --> 02:47:27,913
Vex, you're now seeing three dwarves

5082
02:47:27,913 --> 02:47:29,337
retching and coughing over,

5083
02:47:29,337 --> 02:47:32,481
kind of looking about very nervously.

5084
02:47:32,481 --> 02:47:36,158
LAURA: Can I move to where I can get
a line of site on that one?

5085
02:47:36,158 --> 02:47:37,279
MATT: On this one here?

5086
02:47:37,279 --> 02:47:38,112
LAURA: Yeah.

5087
02:47:38,112 --> 02:47:39,388
MATT: Yeah, you can move to there
and get a line of sight.

5088
02:47:39,388 --> 02:47:41,866
LAURA: Okay cool, then
I'm gonna shoot him.

5089
02:47:41,866 --> 02:47:43,616
Oh wait, no, I can't.

5090
02:47:44,894 --> 02:47:45,727
SAM: Why?

5091
02:47:45,727 --> 02:47:46,923
LAURA: Yeah yeah yeah, I'm gonna do that.

5092
02:47:46,923 --> 02:47:47,898
LIAM: You still have a little bit of cover.

5093
02:47:47,898 --> 02:47:49,969
LAURA: I'm gonna do-- it's fine, I got it.

5094
02:47:49,969 --> 02:47:50,935
I'm really good.

5095
02:47:50,935 --> 02:47:53,188
LIAM: Just be a badass, okay?
That's your job.

5096
02:47:53,188 --> 02:47:54,078
LAURA: Okay.

5097
02:47:55,943 --> 02:47:56,776
27.

5098
02:47:58,047 --> 02:47:59,628
MATT: That hits.

5099
02:47:59,628 --> 02:48:00,592
LIAM: Are you alright, big guy?

5100
02:48:02,058 --> 02:48:03,445
LIAM: "Muh!"

5101
02:48:03,445 --> 02:48:05,761
LAURA: Oh, I should've tried to-- it's okay.

5102
02:48:05,761 --> 02:48:07,554
LIAM: "Muh! Muh!"

5103
02:48:07,554 --> 02:48:10,179
SAM: It's weird, Grog weirdly seems 
smarter now than he was before.

5104
02:48:10,179 --> 02:48:11,381
LAURA: Hunter's Mark on that guy.

5105
02:48:11,381 --> 02:48:12,409
MATT: Okay.

5106
02:48:12,409 --> 02:48:13,242
SAM: Beep boop.

5107
02:48:13,242 --> 02:48:14,378
MATT: Good remembering.

5108
02:48:14,378 --> 02:48:16,321
MARISHA: Professor Grog's 
having a hard time.

5109
02:48:16,321 --> 02:48:17,074
LAURA: 11.

5110
02:48:17,074 --> 02:48:17,907
MATT: 11, all right.

5111
02:48:17,907 --> 02:48:20,220
LAURA: 11, and then I'm gonna 
hit him again.

5112
02:48:20,220 --> 02:48:21,553
And that's a 23.

5113
02:48:22,468 --> 02:48:23,301
MATT: All right.

5114
02:48:23,301 --> 02:48:26,141
LAURA: And that is nine damage for that arrow.

5115
02:48:26,141 --> 02:48:29,150
And then the six for a
Hunter's Mark is five.

5116
02:48:29,150 --> 02:48:30,524
MATT: So a total of...?

5117
02:48:30,524 --> 02:48:33,274
LAURA: Oh jeez-louise, 30 plus five is...

5118
02:48:35,907 --> 02:48:37,335
35.

5119
02:48:37,335 --> 02:48:38,702
MATT: (imitates arrows flying) "Ugh!"

5120
02:48:38,702 --> 02:48:41,946
The hacking, coughing duergar
dwarf is like, (coughs)

5121
02:48:41,946 --> 02:48:44,344
One in the shoulder,
and the other shoulder.

5122
02:48:44,344 --> 02:48:46,554
And it looks like that
you, (inhales sharply)

5123
02:48:46,554 --> 02:48:49,454
As it inhales a big old whiff
of horrible stinking cloud gas,

5124
02:48:49,454 --> 02:48:52,104
the arrow (imitates arrow flying) 
through its throat

5125
02:48:52,104 --> 02:48:53,552
and out the back of its head.

5126
02:48:53,552 --> 02:48:54,850
Falls flat on its back.

5127
02:48:54,850 --> 02:48:55,683
LAURA: Yeah.

5128
02:48:55,683 --> 02:48:57,310
(group cheers)

5129
02:48:57,310 --> 02:48:59,513
MATT: The other ones look nervously about.

5130
02:48:59,513 --> 02:49:01,437
MARISHA: Get him a pillow! What!

5131
02:49:01,437 --> 02:49:04,977
MATT: One of them's just coughing out,
saying something in Undercommon.

5132
02:49:04,984 --> 02:49:06,708
(speaks in angry gibberish)

5133
02:49:06,708 --> 02:49:08,261
MATT: Anyone here speak Undercommon?

5134
02:49:08,261 --> 02:49:09,338
LAURA: I do!

5135
02:49:09,338 --> 02:49:10,171
MATT: You do?

5136
02:49:10,171 --> 02:49:11,253
SAM: You speak Undercommon?

5137
02:49:11,253 --> 02:49:12,086
LAURA: I do.

5138
02:49:12,086 --> 02:49:13,329
TALIESIN: Oondercommon.

5139
02:49:13,329 --> 02:49:15,942
LAURA: I knew we were gonna be
going down into some--

5140
02:49:15,942 --> 02:49:18,918
MATT: You hear him say, 
"Quick, there's our exit!

5141
02:49:18,918 --> 02:49:20,770
"Back, back to the master."

5142
02:49:20,770 --> 02:49:22,648
LAURA: (whispering) Back to the master!

5143
02:49:22,648 --> 02:49:24,122
TRAVIS: Who's the master?

5144
02:49:24,122 --> 02:49:25,834
LAURA: You're unconscious.

5145
02:49:25,834 --> 02:49:26,667
MATT: All right.

5146
02:49:26,667 --> 02:49:28,834
That brings us to Scanlan.

5147
02:49:31,079 --> 02:49:31,996
SAM: Ah, shit.

5148
02:49:31,996 --> 02:49:34,115
I did not understand them, right?

5149
02:49:34,115 --> 02:49:36,274
So I don't know that they're going to run.

5150
02:49:36,274 --> 02:49:36,984
MATT: No.

5151
02:49:36,984 --> 02:49:40,065
TRAVIS: Let 'em run back to the
master and we'll track 'em.

5152
02:49:40,065 --> 02:49:42,648
SAM: I didn't learn that they're running, so.

5153
02:49:42,648 --> 02:49:45,615
Can I call out that I heard them?
Say, "Don't let them run!"

5154
02:49:45,615 --> 02:49:48,374
MATT: No, this happening 
just as you heard them.

5155
02:49:48,744 --> 02:49:49,827
SAM: Okay, well.

5156
02:49:51,652 --> 02:49:53,708
I don't have a good line of sight on them,

5157
02:49:53,708 --> 02:49:57,139
so I don't even know that
they're there really, right?

5158
02:49:57,139 --> 02:49:59,059
I just hear coughing in the distance.

5159
02:49:59,059 --> 02:50:00,535
MATT: Yep.

5160
02:50:00,535 --> 02:50:04,360
Then I'll just move further
into the cavern there.

5161
02:50:04,360 --> 02:50:06,766
And I don't know that this works,

5162
02:50:06,766 --> 02:50:09,973
but I'll try to cast Dispel Magic on Grog.

5163
02:50:09,973 --> 02:50:10,756
MATT: Okay.

5164
02:50:10,756 --> 02:50:12,738
SAM: I don't know if that, if it's magic.

5165
02:50:12,738 --> 02:50:13,658
I have no idea.

5166
02:50:13,658 --> 02:50:16,176
MATT: So you go ahead and you
focus, you cast Dispel Magic

5167
02:50:16,176 --> 02:50:17,037
in Grog's vicinity.

5168
02:50:17,037 --> 02:50:17,865
SAM: ♫ Wake up, Grog ♫

5169
02:50:17,865 --> 02:50:20,204
MATT: You see the shift of arcane,
waving energy.

5170
02:50:20,204 --> 02:50:21,317
TRAVIS: ♫ If I only had a brain ♫

5171
02:50:21,317 --> 02:50:22,157
MATT: It does not seem to have an effect.

5172
02:50:22,157 --> 02:50:23,293
SAM: It doesn't do it!

5173
02:50:23,293 --> 02:50:24,395
Damn it!

5174
02:50:24,395 --> 02:50:27,772
Then as my bonus action, 
can I still give him an inspiration dice

5175
02:50:27,772 --> 02:50:29,425
to do on like saving...?

5176
02:50:29,425 --> 02:50:32,557
MATT: You think at this point,
Grog isn't unconscious.

5177
02:50:32,557 --> 02:50:34,167
Grog is catatonic.

5178
02:50:34,167 --> 02:50:35,910
Grog has no intelligence.

5179
02:50:35,910 --> 02:50:37,405
There is nothing home.

5180
02:50:37,405 --> 02:50:40,171
You see him, on the ground,
drooling, eyes glazed over.

5181
02:50:40,171 --> 02:50:41,107
There is nothing there.

5182
02:50:41,107 --> 02:50:43,214
TALIESIN: You can't inspire a cantaloupe.

5183
02:50:43,214 --> 02:50:44,581
LAURA: What are we gonna do?

5184
02:50:44,581 --> 02:50:47,238
TALIESIN: The cantaloupe,
it's not gonna feel better about itself.

5185
02:50:47,238 --> 02:50:49,567
SAM: Okay, then I give my dice to Vax.

5186
02:50:49,567 --> 02:50:52,745
TALIESIN: I've tried insulting a cantaloupe,
you just don't get anywhere.

5187
02:50:52,745 --> 02:50:56,246
SAM: Vax, I've just inspired you.
(imitates flute)

5188
02:50:56,246 --> 02:50:59,392
MATT: I think the chat room's catching on
for those who know D&amp;D well.

5189
02:50:59,392 --> 02:51:02,048
LIAM: Okay, I hear a little
shithead grey-skinned dwarf--

5190
02:51:02,048 --> 02:51:02,881
SAM: Wait, it's not your turn.

5191
02:51:02,881 --> 02:51:03,714
I just gave you dice.

5192
02:51:03,714 --> 02:51:05,177
I thought you said Vax.
Okay, sorry.

5193
02:51:05,177 --> 02:51:06,213
MATT: It's all right.

5194
02:51:06,213 --> 02:51:07,346
So that ends Scanlan's turn.

5195
02:51:07,346 --> 02:51:08,195
Percy.

5196
02:51:08,195 --> 02:51:09,459
LIAM: Damn it.

5197
02:51:09,459 --> 02:51:11,012
TALIESIN: Laser.

5198
02:51:11,012 --> 02:51:12,595
I'm going to take my laser.

5199
02:51:12,595 --> 02:51:14,096
MATT: Your laser? Point your laser?

5200
02:51:14,096 --> 02:51:15,179
(Liam imitates ray gun)

5201
02:51:15,179 --> 02:51:19,361
TALIESIN: All right, I want to crawl forward
to the other side of Grog over there,

5202
02:51:19,361 --> 02:51:21,567
so I can see this little jerk.

5203
02:51:21,567 --> 02:51:23,626
MATT: It's a tough call, he has cover.

5204
02:51:23,626 --> 02:51:24,859
You can still see him.

5205
02:51:24,859 --> 02:51:26,112
TALIESIN: I ignore cover.

5206
02:51:26,112 --> 02:51:28,244
It's one of my magical things that I do.

5207
02:51:28,244 --> 02:51:30,577
LIAM: Three-quarters cover
according to the new rules.

5208
02:51:30,577 --> 02:51:31,903
MARISHA: Yeah, he's got a gun.

5209
02:51:31,903 --> 02:51:34,605
TALIESIN: Yeah, I ignore half 
or three-quarters cover.

5210
02:51:34,605 --> 02:51:37,366
MATT: Then you can ignore three-quarters cover,
which he has. So, yes.

5211
02:51:37,376 --> 02:51:38,972
TALIESIN: Okay, I ignore it.

5212
02:51:38,972 --> 02:51:42,324
I'm also going to take a penalty
to my attack bonus

5213
02:51:42,324 --> 02:51:46,831
to attempt to do some damage
and to not kill, but injure, if possible.

5214
02:51:47,994 --> 02:51:48,827
MATT: Okay.

5215
02:51:48,827 --> 02:51:50,696
TALIESIN: I wanna leave one for questioning.

5216
02:51:50,696 --> 02:51:51,791
MATT: Okay.

5217
02:51:51,791 --> 02:51:54,370
So go ahead and roll
disadvantage on this attack.

5218
02:51:54,370 --> 02:51:56,705
Or do you want to just do subdual damage,
which is what you're doing?

5219
02:51:56,705 --> 02:51:57,754
TALIESIN: Yeah.

5220
02:51:57,754 --> 02:51:59,789
All right, so you're gonna aim in a way
that doesn't do lethal damage.

5221
02:51:59,789 --> 02:52:00,580
Go for it.

5222
02:52:00,580 --> 02:52:02,543
MATT: It's a normal attack,
there's no penalty to it.

5223
02:52:02,543 --> 02:52:05,016
TALIESIN: Just my penalty for extra damage.

5224
02:52:05,016 --> 02:52:06,132
MATT: Mm hm.

5225
02:52:06,132 --> 02:52:06,965
TALIESIN: Aha!

5226
02:52:07,943 --> 02:52:08,776
I crit!

5227
02:52:09,725 --> 02:52:10,892
So that's fun.

5228
02:52:12,987 --> 02:52:14,487
Let's roll damage.

5229
02:52:16,477 --> 02:52:18,292
9, 10, that's 25 points of damage.

5230
02:52:18,292 --> 02:52:19,125
LAURA: Yeah!

5231
02:52:19,125 --> 02:52:20,494
MATT: 25 points of damage.

5232
02:52:20,494 --> 02:52:23,445
All right, you run around the corner,
pull the gun out,

5233
02:52:23,445 --> 02:52:25,662
and aim at this like-- (coughs)

5234
02:52:25,662 --> 02:52:29,349
Where you look now, you see this
ghastly looking, evil, female-looking

5235
02:52:29,349 --> 02:52:30,947
grey-skinned dwarf.

5236
02:52:30,947 --> 02:52:32,809
Looks over at you and (gasps)

5237
02:52:32,809 --> 02:52:34,169
reacts and goes for her weapon.

5238
02:52:34,169 --> 02:52:35,577
As you do, you let loose and fire straight

5239
02:52:35,577 --> 02:52:38,217
into her shoulder, blasting
through most of her shoulder,

5240
02:52:38,217 --> 02:52:39,560
exposing bone.

5241
02:52:39,560 --> 02:52:41,466
It's not a deahtblow, but you see

5242
02:52:41,466 --> 02:52:43,234
she has been incapacitated.

5243
02:52:43,234 --> 02:52:44,067
ORION: Nice.

5244
02:52:44,067 --> 02:52:45,429
TALIESIN: That's my turn.

5245
02:52:45,429 --> 02:52:48,621
LAURA: I call out, "Let one of them live, 
so I can question them."

5246
02:52:48,621 --> 02:52:50,246
TALIESIN: That's-- we got one.

5247
02:52:50,246 --> 02:52:51,629
MATT: Keyleth, you're up.

5248
02:52:51,629 --> 02:52:52,654
MARISHA: We got one?

5249
02:52:52,654 --> 02:52:53,677
TALIESIN: We got one.

5250
02:52:54,280 --> 02:52:55,343
MARISHA: Well, then.

5251
02:52:55,343 --> 02:52:56,656
MATT: That dwarf survived.

5252
02:52:56,656 --> 02:52:57,673
With one hit point.

5253
02:52:57,673 --> 02:53:00,240
MARISHA: If we got the guy we need.

5254
02:53:00,593 --> 02:53:03,097
I will move over a bit.

5255
02:53:03,097 --> 02:53:04,288
Yeah.

5256
02:53:04,288 --> 02:53:05,770
And... (imitates energy firing)

5257
02:53:05,770 --> 02:53:07,121
MATT: All right, go for it.

5258
02:53:07,121 --> 02:53:08,357
LIAM: Vines?

5259
02:53:08,357 --> 02:53:11,630
MATT: First off, make a constitution save,
'cause you stepped into a stinking cloud.

5260
02:53:11,630 --> 02:53:13,297
Unless you wanna move back here.

5261
02:53:13,297 --> 02:53:14,868
There you go.

5262
02:53:15,330 --> 02:53:17,320
MARISHA: Not having control.

5263
02:53:17,320 --> 02:53:18,358
MATT: Laser pointer.

5264
02:53:18,358 --> 02:53:21,434
MARISHA: I do (mumbles).

5265
02:53:21,434 --> 02:53:22,338
Okay.

5266
02:53:24,113 --> 02:53:25,113
So that is...

5267
02:53:27,320 --> 02:53:28,153
what is that?

5268
02:53:28,153 --> 02:53:28,986
22?

5269
02:53:28,986 --> 02:53:30,645
MATT: 22 points of damage. All right.

5270
02:53:30,645 --> 02:53:32,690
So the bolt streaks from
the cloud in the sky,

5271
02:53:32,690 --> 02:53:34,250
slamming into this other duergar.

5272
02:53:34,250 --> 02:53:36,033
As it sparks into the ground,
you see bits of stone

5273
02:53:36,033 --> 02:53:38,007
get thrown up from the
sheer force of the bolt,

5274
02:53:38,007 --> 02:53:39,702
doing a sincere amount of damage to it.

5275
02:53:39,702 --> 02:53:42,760
Not enough to finish it, but
it looks very, very fucked up.

5276
02:53:42,760 --> 02:53:44,603
You can see part of its face
is charred now,

5277
02:53:44,603 --> 02:53:46,051
and it's reeling from the blast.

5278
02:53:46,051 --> 02:53:49,202
Probably blew out its eardrums
from the cacophonous blast of the thunder.

5279
02:53:49,213 --> 02:53:50,513
MARISHA: That's my turn.

5280
02:53:50,513 --> 02:53:51,674
MATT: That's your turn.

5281
02:53:51,674 --> 02:53:54,174
It's now both of their turn.

5282
02:53:54,176 --> 02:53:56,724
They both failed their
saves with a two and a four.

5283
02:53:56,724 --> 02:54:00,001
They're both still hacking and coughing
in the stinking cloud.

5284
02:54:00,001 --> 02:54:01,084
Uh, go bards.

5285
02:54:01,084 --> 02:54:02,604
Vax, you're up.

5286
02:54:02,604 --> 02:54:06,379
LIAM: Okay, and there's a big cloud
of poo stink around them, so--

5287
02:54:06,379 --> 02:54:08,258
MATT: Correct, so all here.

5288
02:54:08,258 --> 02:54:10,438
ORION: "The poo cloud," Keyleth calls it.

5289
02:54:10,438 --> 02:54:12,121
LIAM: God dammit. All right.

5290
02:54:12,121 --> 02:54:13,594
MARISHA: Do I? "The poo cloud."

5291
02:54:13,594 --> 02:54:14,427
LIAM: Fuck it.

5292
02:54:14,427 --> 02:54:15,980
SAM: Just go in there, man.

5293
02:54:15,980 --> 02:54:18,543
LIAM: I'm gonna hold my
breath, and I'm gonna go

5294
02:54:18,543 --> 02:54:20,876
one, two, three, four, five,

5295
02:54:22,839 --> 02:54:24,407
and grab this guy around the neck

5296
02:54:24,407 --> 02:54:27,195
and hold my daggers to his neck.

5297
02:54:27,195 --> 02:54:29,765
And just hunker down and
try to hold him hostage.

5298
02:54:29,765 --> 02:54:30,734
MATT: Okay.

5299
02:54:30,734 --> 02:54:33,052
Go ahead and make a constitution check.

5300
02:54:33,052 --> 02:54:34,755
TRAVIS: A dirty mafia check?

5301
02:54:34,755 --> 02:54:36,271
LIAM: Is that a, is that a--

5302
02:54:36,271 --> 02:54:39,367
MATT: With advantage, because
you're holding your breath.

5303
02:54:39,367 --> 02:54:40,465
LIAM: Okay.

5304
02:54:40,465 --> 02:54:41,298
14.

5305
02:54:41,298 --> 02:54:42,641
TRAVIS: Just breathe it in.

5306
02:54:42,641 --> 02:54:44,140
SAM: Use the dice! Use the dice!

5307
02:54:44,140 --> 02:54:45,233
LIAM: What did you give me?

5308
02:54:45,233 --> 02:54:46,249
SAM: A d8.

5309
02:54:46,249 --> 02:54:47,141
LIAM: 22.

5310
02:54:47,141 --> 02:54:49,451
SAM: No, it's not an eight. A d8.
You gotta roll it.

5311
02:54:49,451 --> 02:54:51,102
MATT: Roll a d8 to add to it.

5312
02:54:52,112 --> 02:54:52,945
LIAM: 15.

5313
02:54:52,945 --> 02:54:54,005
(group laughs)

5314
02:54:54,005 --> 02:54:55,898
LIAM: It came up a one.

5315
02:54:55,898 --> 02:54:56,731
TRAVIS: 22!

5316
02:54:56,731 --> 02:54:59,592
MATT: So, as you rush in the cloud,
(breathes deeply)

5317
02:54:59,592 --> 02:55:01,718
you run in, pull your daggers out,

5318
02:55:01,718 --> 02:55:04,968
and because this isn't a natural cloud,
the arcane force puts it in your nostrils

5319
02:55:04,968 --> 02:55:06,813
and you can't help yourself. (coughs)

5320
02:55:06,813 --> 02:55:09,935
Your turn immediately ends 
as you begin feeling your lunch

5321
02:55:09,935 --> 02:55:11,612
retching up into your stomach.

5322
02:55:11,612 --> 02:55:12,935
TRAVIS: Puke on him.

5323
02:55:12,935 --> 02:55:14,762
MATT: Okay. That brings us to Grog.

5324
02:55:14,762 --> 02:55:15,595
You are a--

5325
02:55:15,595 --> 02:55:16,838
TRAVIS: Oh, I got it.

5326
02:55:16,838 --> 02:55:18,220
(blows raspberry)

5327
02:55:18,220 --> 02:55:19,296
MATT: You are brain-dead.

5328
02:55:19,296 --> 02:55:20,150
(group laughs)

5329
02:55:20,150 --> 02:55:21,162
Tiberius, you're up.

5330
02:55:21,162 --> 02:55:22,684
LAURA: So sorry, Grog.

5331
02:55:22,684 --> 02:55:25,186
SAM: Can we heal him, what is it?
What do we need to do?

5332
02:55:25,186 --> 02:55:26,969
MARISHA: We'll figure that out when
we kill this guy, I guess.

5333
02:55:26,969 --> 02:55:27,802
LAURA: Restoration?

5334
02:55:27,802 --> 02:55:29,359
LIAM: Can you dispel that shit?

5335
02:55:29,359 --> 02:55:30,617
SAM: I tried, I tried.

5336
02:55:30,617 --> 02:55:32,261
MARISHA: He can't dispel it,
It's not magic.

5337
02:55:32,261 --> 02:55:34,119
But I might be able to 
cure him afterwards.

5338
02:55:34,119 --> 02:55:35,881
LIAM: Tiberius, can you dispel that shit?

5339
02:55:35,881 --> 02:55:36,714
ORION: It's the same spell.

5340
02:55:36,714 --> 02:55:39,498
LAURA: It's a restoration spell, 
it's not a dispel.

5341
02:55:41,134 --> 02:55:42,786
MARISHA: I might be able to.

5342
02:55:42,786 --> 02:55:46,682
ORION: So, the guy knocked down 
over there is--

5343
02:55:46,682 --> 02:55:49,218
let me see that pointer.

5344
02:55:49,218 --> 02:55:52,876
This guy, that's the one that
we knocked out with the arrow?

5345
02:55:52,876 --> 02:55:55,104
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's the dead one.

5346
02:55:55,104 --> 02:55:56,460
ORION: The dead one 
or the one we knocked out?

5347
02:55:56,460 --> 02:55:57,885
TALIESIN: He's dead.

5348
02:55:57,885 --> 02:55:58,718
ORION: Who do we have incapacitated?

5349
02:55:58,718 --> 02:55:59,551
TALIESIN: That's the one we shot.

5350
02:55:59,551 --> 02:56:00,886
MARISHA: That's the one Liam has.

5351
02:56:00,886 --> 02:56:02,308
LAURA: Let one live.

5352
02:56:02,308 --> 02:56:03,338
ORION: And the one right here is...?

5353
02:56:03,338 --> 02:56:05,073
LIAM: The one by me is weak.

5354
02:56:05,073 --> 02:56:07,863
MATT: Both of them are pretty
weak right now, actually.

5355
02:56:07,863 --> 02:56:11,236
ORION: I think I can step next to Percy
without stepping into that cloud.

5356
02:56:11,236 --> 02:56:12,584
MATT: So you can step over Grog,
get around here, you mean?

5357
02:56:12,584 --> 02:56:13,777
LAURA: (laughs) Honk.

5358
02:56:13,777 --> 02:56:15,046
TRAVIS: That's-- come on.

5359
02:56:15,529 --> 02:56:18,426
ORION: Sorry, excuse me, Grog, pardon.

5360
02:56:18,426 --> 02:56:22,000
I will shoot a firebolt 
at the butthole across the way.

5361
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:25,153
MATT: There? All right.
Go ahead and roll for the attack.

5362
02:56:27,745 --> 02:56:28,578
ORION: 14.

5363
02:56:28,578 --> 02:56:29,534
MATT: 14.

5364
02:56:29,534 --> 02:56:31,243
Unfortunately does not hit.

5365
02:56:31,243 --> 02:56:33,764
You aim, and it manages to
just pull out of the way.

5366
02:56:33,764 --> 02:56:35,075
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

5367
02:56:35,075 --> 02:56:36,390
MATT: Vex. You're up.

5368
02:56:36,390 --> 02:56:37,223
LAURA: Me?

5369
02:56:37,223 --> 02:56:38,056
MATT: Yes.

5370
02:56:38,056 --> 02:56:40,917
LAURA: I step over, and I try to shoot
the one that he just--

5371
02:56:41,763 --> 02:56:43,183
I stay out of the stink.

5372
02:56:43,183 --> 02:56:44,625
MATT: There you go, yeah.

5373
02:56:44,625 --> 02:56:46,491
Pull back-- (imitates bow shooting arrow)

5374
02:56:46,491 --> 02:56:47,324
LAURA: All right.

5375
02:56:47,324 --> 02:56:48,741
MATT: Roll to attack.

5376
02:56:50,582 --> 02:56:51,729
LAURA: 23.

5377
02:56:51,729 --> 02:56:54,896
MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.

5378
02:56:55,837 --> 02:56:56,670
LAURA: 8.

5379
02:56:56,670 --> 02:56:57,644
MATT: That's enough.

5380
02:56:57,644 --> 02:57:00,187
As the arrow (imitates arrow flying),
careens off, slams into the chest.

5381
02:57:00,191 --> 02:57:02,564
(groans) It catches itself, steps back,

5382
02:57:02,564 --> 02:57:04,639
and plummets off the side of the cliff

5383
02:57:04,639 --> 02:57:06,902
onto the lower floor about 20 feet down.

5384
02:57:06,902 --> 02:57:08,104
Smack, onto the ground.

5385
02:57:08,504 --> 02:57:09,979
LAURA: And I ask Scanlan
to dispel the stank cloud.

5386
02:57:09,979 --> 02:57:12,979
TALIESIN: Dispel the stank.

5387
02:57:12,979 --> 02:57:16,342
LAURA: And I yell--
Can I yell out "surrender" in Undercommon?

5388
02:57:17,289 --> 02:57:19,410
MATT: You yell out, (speaks angry gibberish)!

5389
02:57:19,410 --> 02:57:20,933
(Laura speaks angry gibberish)

5390
02:57:20,933 --> 02:57:22,333
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

5391
02:57:22,333 --> 02:57:24,676
TRAVIS: That was a very good Klingon translation.

5392
02:57:24,676 --> 02:57:25,509
LAURA: Klingon.

5393
02:57:25,509 --> 02:57:27,723
(Liam speaks angry gibberish)

5394
02:57:28,096 --> 02:57:29,290
Whoa! Okay.

5395
02:57:30,480 --> 02:57:31,379
Um, eight.

5396
02:57:31,379 --> 02:57:32,212
MATT: Eight?

5397
02:57:32,212 --> 02:57:33,209
LAURA: Eight.

5398
02:57:33,209 --> 02:57:35,082
LIAM: What is with the dice tonight?

5399
02:57:35,082 --> 02:57:36,174
MATT: It rolled a one.

5400
02:57:36,174 --> 02:57:37,391
(group cheers)

5401
02:57:37,391 --> 02:57:42,306
MATT: It looks around and its
circumstances being extremely dire.

5402
02:57:42,306 --> 02:57:45,094
It drops its weapons, falls to its knees.

5403
02:57:45,094 --> 02:57:46,642
At your mercy.

5404
02:57:46,642 --> 02:57:47,853
That's where we'll end the game tonight.

5405
02:57:47,853 --> 02:57:49,520
SAM: Oh!
TALIESIN: Hey!

5406
02:57:49,520 --> 02:57:50,379
TRAVIS: What?!

5407
02:57:50,379 --> 02:57:51,212
MATT: Yeah.

5408
02:57:51,212 --> 02:57:52,045
LAURA: You're, you're-- yeah.

5409
02:57:52,045 --> 02:57:53,208
SAM: Grog is brain dead.

5410
02:57:53,208 --> 02:57:56,041
MARISHA: I was gonna say, can I
go over and heal Grog before we end?

5411
02:57:56,041 --> 02:57:57,703
TRAVIS: I'm Vanilla Sky right now.

5412
02:57:57,703 --> 02:57:58,536
MATT: Nope, we're picking up next week.

5413
02:57:58,536 --> 02:57:59,506
LAURA: Oh no.

5414
02:57:59,506 --> 02:58:02,183
LIAM: Just five more hours, Matt.
Just five more hours.

5415
02:58:02,183 --> 02:58:04,070
MATT: We'll say for the circumstance here,

5416
02:58:04,070 --> 02:58:06,443
you go ahead and spend
a healing spell on him.

5417
02:58:06,443 --> 02:58:08,826
His wounds mend, no effect
on his catatonic state.

5418
02:58:08,826 --> 02:58:09,894
(group groans)

5419
02:58:10,184 --> 02:58:12,215
SAM: We have to wait a week.

5420
02:58:12,215 --> 02:58:14,888
MATT: Well guys, that's episode two
of Critical Role.

5421
02:58:14,888 --> 02:58:15,902
(laughs)

5422
02:58:15,902 --> 02:58:16,735
MARISHA: Damn it.

5423
02:58:16,735 --> 02:58:17,751
MATT: I hope you enjoyed it.

5424
02:58:17,751 --> 02:58:20,132
Remember to tell your
friends to come watch.

5425
02:58:20,132 --> 02:58:22,298
We'll be back next week, Thursday at 7:00.

5426
02:58:22,298 --> 02:58:24,225
I know the schedule said seven to nine.

5427
02:58:24,225 --> 02:58:25,766
We usually run a little later.

5428
02:58:25,766 --> 02:58:27,071
Because D&amp;D and why not?

5429
02:58:27,071 --> 02:58:28,387
LAURA: Oh, is this seven to nine?

5430
02:58:28,387 --> 02:58:30,130
MATT: It says seven to nine in the schedule,

5431
02:58:30,130 --> 02:58:31,757
but we consider seven to ten.

5432
02:58:31,757 --> 02:58:33,025
But yeah, hope you guys had fun.

5433
02:58:33,025 --> 02:58:34,189
Thank you so much for watching.

5434
02:58:34,189 --> 02:58:36,813
Hope we will have our
donations up next week.

5435
02:58:36,813 --> 02:58:37,988
Feel free to check it out.

5436
02:58:37,988 --> 02:58:40,721
This is Zac, our amazing
master of all awesomeness

5437
02:58:40,721 --> 02:58:42,052
on this Twitch channel.

5438
02:58:42,052 --> 02:58:43,468
Hey Zac, what's going on?

5439
02:58:43,468 --> 02:58:44,773
ZAC: Hey, good job, guys.

5440
02:58:44,773 --> 02:58:46,106
MATT: Thank you, thank you.

5441
02:58:46,106 --> 02:58:47,800
ZAC: You got a thousand subscribers.

5442
02:58:47,800 --> 02:58:48,866
(group cheers)

5443
02:58:48,866 --> 02:58:51,421
ZAC: Crazy, that's like, two weeks in.

5444
02:58:51,421 --> 02:58:52,254
MATT: Yeah, I know.

5445
02:58:52,254 --> 02:58:53,904
You go, Nyal.
We'll get you your stuff.

5446
02:58:53,904 --> 02:58:55,770
MARISHA: Yeah, you get a 
Player's Handbook. That's lucky.

5447
02:58:55,770 --> 02:58:56,994
ZAC: We'll get you your shit!

5448
02:58:56,994 --> 02:58:58,308
I gotta print that photo so
you guys can all sign it.

5449
02:58:58,308 --> 02:58:59,814
MATT: Yes yes, let's go do that.

5450
02:58:59,814 --> 02:59:02,376
ZAC: No, it'll probably be
sent to you next Friday,

5451
02:59:02,376 --> 02:59:04,818
'cause we'll have you guys
sign it next Thursday.

5452
02:59:04,818 --> 02:59:05,941
LAURA: Sounds good.

5453
02:59:05,941 --> 02:59:06,774
MATT: Okay, cool.

5454
02:59:06,774 --> 02:59:09,437
TRAVIS: Zac, do you have any renew
intelligence potions on you, by chance?

5455
02:59:09,437 --> 02:59:10,244
ZAC: For you?

5456
02:59:10,244 --> 02:59:11,077
TRAVIS: Yeah.

5457
02:59:11,077 --> 02:59:11,910
ZAC: No.

5458
02:59:11,910 --> 02:59:12,743
TRAVIS: Shit.

5459
02:59:12,743 --> 02:59:13,886
MATT: Sorry buddy.

5460
02:59:13,886 --> 02:59:16,396
ZAC: So we're not going offline
for the night yet.

5461
02:59:16,396 --> 02:59:17,932
These guys are gonna head out

5462
02:59:17,932 --> 02:59:21,980
and Lucas and I are gonna play
some Hotline Miami 2.

5463
02:59:21,980 --> 02:59:23,293
For an hour, hour and a half.

5464
02:59:23,303 --> 02:59:24,936
MATT: There you go, rock it out.

5465
02:59:24,936 --> 02:59:27,749
ZAC: You know, just to close out the night
with a subscriber-only chat

5466
02:59:27,749 --> 02:59:30,382
to say thank you to our
thousand subscribers.

5467
02:59:30,382 --> 02:59:33,588
And tomorrow night we will be back
with So You Don't Have to,

5468
02:59:33,588 --> 02:59:36,989
which is a show where Hector and Becca
play the weirdest games

5469
02:59:36,989 --> 02:59:40,349
they can find online,
so you don't have to.

5470
02:59:40,349 --> 02:59:41,182
MARISHA: Nice.

5471
02:59:41,182 --> 02:59:42,015
(Matt laughs)

5472
02:59:42,015 --> 02:59:43,486
ZAC: And then we finish off tomorrow night
with Gather Your Party,

5473
02:59:43,486 --> 02:59:45,531
which is just a big party
where we're going to be celebrating

5474
02:59:45,531 --> 02:59:48,302
getting 1000 subscribers,
playing some board games.

5475
02:59:48,302 --> 02:59:50,054
We have a band coming in to play.

5476
02:59:50,054 --> 02:59:50,991
MATT: Awesome.

5477
02:59:50,991 --> 02:59:51,824
ZAC: It's gonna be a good time.

5478
02:59:51,824 --> 02:59:53,815
We might even have a DJ spinning some--
I don't know.

5479
02:59:53,815 --> 02:59:55,143
How do you say it?

5480
02:59:55,143 --> 02:59:55,976
Spinning?

5481
02:59:55,976 --> 02:59:57,039
TRAVIS: Some tunes.

5482
02:59:57,039 --> 02:59:58,182
MATT: Spin tunes.

5483
02:59:58,182 --> 02:59:59,935
TRAVIS: Dropping some dope beats.

5484
02:59:59,935 --> 03:00:02,128
ORION: On the ones and twos.
Ones and twos.

5485
03:00:02,128 --> 03:00:03,952
ZAC: So thank you guys again.

5486
03:00:03,952 --> 03:00:06,672
Lucas, if you wanna go ahead
and roll those videos,

5487
03:00:06,672 --> 03:00:08,145
and we'll get you guys out of here.

5488
03:00:08,145 --> 03:00:09,768
MATT: Thank you guys for watching.

5489
03:00:09,768 --> 03:00:10,551
ALL: Bye!
