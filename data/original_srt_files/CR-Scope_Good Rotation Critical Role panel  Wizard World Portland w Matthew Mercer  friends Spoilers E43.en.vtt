00:00:31.747 --> 00:00:34.194

00:00:47.013 --> 00:00:48.853
MARISHA: I guess you guys want to share a mic?

00:00:50.503 --> 00:00:55.572

this many people is a feat.

00:01:09.585 --> 00:01:11.608

TRAVIS: Overwatch.

00:01:59.243 --> 00:02:06.426
MATT: (whispery ominous voice) Be careful he’s
watching. (normal voice) We are all actors. We

00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:11.213
also are part of a online D&amp;D game called Critical
Role--

00:02:11.213 --> 00:02:15.055
(cheering)

00:02:15.755 --> 00:02:21.061
MATT: Where we play Dungeons &amp; Dragons every week
on Twitch with Geek &amp; Sundry. That’s <i>not</i> what

00:02:21.061 --> 00:02:22.575
this panel’s about!

00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:29.342
MARISHA: I mean, it could be what it’s about. It
kind of is. We’re not going to stop it. We’d kind

00:02:29.342 --> 00:02:31.134
of rather talk about D&amp;D.

00:02:31.134 --> 00:02:32.144
LAURA: No! That’s not true.

00:02:32.144 --> 00:02:33.184
MATT: That’s not true at all.

00:02:34.234 --> 00:02:36.026
MARISHA: <i>I’d</i> rather talk about D&amp;D.

00:02:36.026 --> 00:02:37.332
(laughter)

00:02:37.332 --> 00:02:38.493
MARISHA: I’ll speak for myself.

00:02:39.523 --> 00:02:45.263
MATT: The main topics of this panel will be-- the
theme of it is voiceover and animation, video

00:02:45.263 --> 00:02:49.465
games in general. World of voiceover, our
experiences there, and your questions regarding

00:02:49.465 --> 00:02:54.614
that bit of silliness. But, you are also free to
slip in D&amp;D-related questions, should you feel

00:02:54.614 --> 00:02:59.540
driven to do so. But first, let’s begin with
introductions. Let’s go ahead and talk a little

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.513
bit about ourselves and what we do, starting with
Travis Willingham!

00:03:02.513 --> 00:03:11.544
TRAVIS: Hi, I’m Travis Willingham. I’m a Leo. I
play a goliath barbarian on Critical Role named

00:03:11.544 --> 00:03:20.025
Grog. I’ve done lots of animes like Fullmetal
Alchemist and Ouran Host Club and stuff like that.

00:03:20.025 --> 00:03:25.823
Lots of video games. Last year was Halo 5:
Guardians. A couple of other things. I like to

00:03:25.823 --> 00:03:27.403
talk into mics for fun! Woo!

00:03:27.403 --> 00:03:32.606
(applause)

00:03:34.756 --> 00:03:36.909
TALIESIN: Hi, my name is Taliesin Jaffe.

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:42.499
(cheering)

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:48.389
TALIESIN: You don’t have to clap, but that was
nice. I play the human gunslinger Percival

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:54.268
Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo the
Third on Twitch on Thursdays. But other than that,

00:03:54.268 --> 00:04:01.677
I also like to talk into microphones. You can hear
me in lots of animes, most recently Black Butler:

00:04:01.677 --> 00:04:05.731
Book of Murder, which is coming out in a couple of
months. Black butlers.

00:04:05.731 --> 00:04:07.809
(laughter)

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:12.799
TALIESIN: And lots of video games. Final Fantasy
IV, Street Fighter IV, World of Warcraft.

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:25.437
MARISHA: Hello, I am Marisha Ray. I play the
half-elven druid Keyleth on Critical Role. And I

00:04:25.437 --> 00:04:32.729
also talk into microphones, like everybody else,
and like I am currently. In Metal Gear Phantom

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:41.638
Pain, Star Wars Battlefront. Just came out, Fire
Emblem: Fates, which half of us are in. You can

00:04:41.638 --> 00:04:46.760
also watch Super Power Beat Down, which is a show
that I host, because I sometimes also talk into cameras.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.045
(cheering)

00:04:52.235 --> 00:04:58.584
LAURA: Hi, I’m Laura Bailey. Oh my gosh, I’m a
Gemini, which is actually kind of cool because I

00:04:58.584 --> 00:05:00.505
am a twin on Critical Role as well.

00:05:02.465 --> 00:05:06.684
I play the half-elven ranger Vex'ahlia and
I have a bear named Trinket.

00:05:06.684 --> 00:05:08.366
MATT: (bear sounds)

00:05:08.366 --> 00:05:14.685
LAURA: Thank you. Thank you, Trinket. I guess in
the last, what, the last year? Halo 5: Guardians.

00:05:14.685 --> 00:05:24.330
Street Fighter 5. Avengers Assemble. Uncharted 4,
coming up.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.480
(cheering, applause)

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:44.560
SAM: Hi. I'm Sam Riegel, I've lost my voice. My
sign is Libra. Very measured and even-keeled. I

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:57.405
play Scanlan Shorthalt, the bard gnome on Critical
Role. I also act in things sometimes and I don't

00:05:57.405 --> 00:06:07.473
know what I’ve done. I did some Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles for a while. I was Spiderman in

00:06:07.473 --> 00:06:15.414
Spiderman games. I was in Persona as the little
annoying Teddie. Other things too, I die in a lot

00:06:15.414 --> 00:06:25.464
of games. Any game that Laura is killing things
in, I'm also dying in. I also started directing

00:06:25.464 --> 00:06:33.554
stuff too. So I direct voices for animation and
for Disney. In fact I'm going to be directing Matt

00:06:33.554 --> 00:06:35.864
Mercer tomorrow at 9:00AM.

00:06:38.234 --> 00:06:39.715
MATT: Thanks for the reminder.

00:06:40.755 --> 00:06:45.095
MARISHA: I love how they act like you were getting
called into the principal's office. Like ooh, snap!

00:06:47.715 --> 00:06:49.974
MATT: At least my character voices aren't
high-pitched tomorrow.

00:06:50.664 --> 00:06:51.384
LAURA: Mine are.

00:06:52.464 --> 00:06:54.735
SAM: One of them's like Mickey Mouse range.

00:06:54.735 --> 00:06:55.861
MATT: I was being ironic.

00:06:58.191 --> 00:07:00.285
SAM: (high-pitched noise) That’s fun!

00:07:01.485 --> 00:07:12.355
MATT: Hi, my name is Matthew Mercer. I'm Dungeon
Master. I'm a Cancer. That's not my sign, that's

00:07:12.355 --> 00:07:21.634
my self-esteem. "I'm a cancer!" I also talk into
microphones for a living. Cartoons, video games.

00:07:21.634 --> 00:07:23.444
Leon Kennedy in Resident Evil.

00:07:24.964 --> 00:07:26.354
LAURA: Oh yeah, we were a pair.

00:07:26.354 --> 00:07:28.743
MATT: Yeah! What's up? How's my hair look?

00:07:28.743 --> 00:07:32.729
SAM: You both killed me, I'm sure. (zombie noise)

00:07:32.729 --> 00:07:41.311
MATT: Recent-ish stuff, there's Fallout 4. I was
MacCready. Fire Emblem: Fates, which just came out

00:07:41.311 --> 00:07:46.320
also. I was Ryoma as well as a few other
characters. Yeah, so that's our introduction...

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.209
and that's our panel. Thanks guys for coming!

00:07:48.209 --> 00:07:51.349
(laughter)

00:07:51.349 --> 00:07:56.488
MATT: Let's go ahead and kick this off with a
little bit of Q&amp;A. If you're not sick of us by now

00:07:56.488 --> 00:08:00.889
this weekend, let's see if we can make this happen
soon. You sir at the very front, go bring your

00:08:00.889 --> 00:08:02.337
question to the microphone.

00:08:02.337 --> 00:08:10.457
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi guys. Apparently the mic's a
little hot still. I'll just stand right here. Hi

00:08:10.457 --> 00:08:15.269
guys, Law Johnson, Facebook's Dungeons &amp; Dragons
Memes, awesome to see you again. I hope you guys

00:08:15.269 --> 00:08:19.961
are having a super fun time in Portland and thank
you on behalf of all Portland Critters for

00:08:19.961 --> 00:08:29.797
bringing your magic to our weird city. (Grog
voice) I would like to ask a question.

00:08:29.797 --> 00:08:34.760
(normal voice) I'm going to be that guy and-- right out
the gate-- start with a D&amp;D question because my

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:39.050
fans will kill me if I don't. It has a little bit
to do with acting so that's something. In a

00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:44.411
hypothetical scenario in which they make a Vox
Machina live-action movie, which professional

00:08:44.411 --> 00:08:47.768
actor that was not yourself would you choose to
play your character?

00:08:50.478 --> 00:08:51.758
MATT: That's a great question.

00:08:53.488 --> 00:08:54.918
SAM: Arnold Schwarzenegger.

00:08:56.448 --> 00:08:57.532
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Dave Bautista!

00:08:58.193 --> 00:08:59.953
TRAVIS: Dave Bautista would be Grog!

00:09:03.473 --> 00:09:04.603
SAM: Dinklage, for me.

00:09:04.603 --> 00:09:14.630
(cheering, applause)

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:17.446
MARISHA: We were toying around with Zooey
Deschanel for Keyleth?

00:09:17.446 --> 00:09:19.496
(noises of agreement)

00:09:19.496 --> 00:09:20.703
TALIESIN: We've had this conversation.

00:09:20.703 --> 00:09:22.953
LAURA: Maybe like Kate Beckinsale or something.

00:09:26.723 --> 00:09:28.492
MATT: Kate Beckinsale, yeah! I can see that.

00:09:28.492 --> 00:09:29.324
MARISHA: She's hot.

00:09:29.324 --> 00:09:32.603
TALIESIN: Is it Hugh Dancy from Hannibal who plays
Will Graham?

00:09:35.753 --> 00:09:37.161
MATT: Who do you want for Vax?

00:09:37.161 --> 00:09:38.982
SAM: Oh, what about Gilmore?

00:09:40.282 --> 00:09:43.152
LAURA: Oh, oh! Somebody posted something on
Twitter and it was like, "Oh my god, he's

00:09:43.152 --> 00:09:46.851
perfect". It was the guy who played Sayid on Lost.

00:09:46.851 --> 00:09:48.601
MATT: Yeah! Oh, he'd be phenomenal.

00:09:48.601 --> 00:09:49.641
LAURA: Or he'd be <i>dreamy</i>.

00:09:50.461 --> 00:09:55.102
MATT: Or, also the guy who plays Oberyn on Game of
Thrones.

00:09:56.472 --> 00:10:00.511
MARISHA: Ooh, yeah, I agree with that.

00:10:02.731 --> 00:10:05.972
MATT: Man or woman, you had to agree, Oberyn had
it going on.

00:10:07.742 --> 00:10:08.961
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Awesome, thank you guys.

00:10:08.961 --> 00:10:10.342
MATT: Good question, thank you.

00:10:10.342 --> 00:10:14.762
(applause)

00:10:16.212 --> 00:10:19.253
SAM: Oh, and Trinket would be played by the bear
from The Revenant.

00:10:19.268 --> 00:10:23.718
(laughter)

00:10:23.723 --> 00:10:27.142
MATT: I'm so glad that guy's getting work again.

00:10:27.142 --> 00:10:28.593
SAM: Ah yes, go ahead.

00:10:31.503 --> 00:10:37.590
AUDIENCE MEMBER: What is your favorite voice to
ever do when you do voice acting? Also, never have

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:45.276
Travis play a fighter attached with a rogue. It's
400 points of damage a round.

00:10:49.486 --> 00:10:52.612
TRAVIS: You said numbers. I don't understand.

00:10:54.252 --> 00:10:57.352
MATT: All right, so favorite voice you've ever
performed.

00:10:59.242 --> 00:11:00.922
TRAVIS: Start that way this time.

00:11:05.212 --> 00:11:06.632
SAM: No wait, that's you Matt, you start.

00:11:06.632 --> 00:11:08.301
MATT: No no please, go ahead.

00:11:10.501 --> 00:11:13.902
LAURA: Why does it feel like it's so early and
it's noon now?

00:11:13.902 --> 00:11:19.271
TRAVIS: We're all going to give the answer like,
"It's like trying to pick between your children.

00:11:19.271 --> 00:11:21.783
"You just can't have one favorite."

00:11:28.483 --> 00:11:34.706
SAM: I did the voice of Starscream a couple times.
That was really fun and it was horrifyingly bad on

00:11:34.706 --> 00:11:41.776
your vocal cords. It was fun to do. What about
you, Matt?

00:11:43.436 --> 00:11:46.458
MATT: There's one project I can't talk about right
now but I'm really excited about.

00:11:46.458 --> 00:11:48.447
TRAVIS: Do it anyway, violate your NDA!

00:11:48.447 --> 00:11:55.877
MATT: No. I will say from a personality
standpoint, I really really personally enjoyed

00:11:55.877 --> 00:12:05.647
Aloth in Pillars of Eternity. (Aloth voice) "Just
a sort of very slightly nervous elven wizard who

00:12:05.647 --> 00:12:11.467
has an issue wherein his body actually contains
two souls and one happens to be this ancient woman

00:12:11.467 --> 00:12:15.461
named Iselmyr who creeps out on occasion but not
really to--" (Iselmyr voice) “get really angry at

00:12:15.461 --> 00:12:23.436
people! Shut up you fucking cocksmith!" (Aloth
voice) "I'm terribly sorry. That wasn't me. That

00:12:23.436 --> 00:12:25.576
was Iselmyr. Please don't hit me."

00:12:29.466 --> 00:12:33.488
TALIESIN: PCB let me Ed Wynn for a video game
once.

00:12:34.238 --> 00:12:37.276
MARISHA: I love your Ed Wynn. It is so cool.

00:12:37.276 --> 00:12:39.739
TALIESIN: I was like, "Can I do the Ed Wynn for
this game cause no one's ever going to play this

00:12:39.739 --> 00:12:43.712
game?" They're like, "Yeah sure." (Ed Wynn voice)
So the entire game I get to play a villain who

00:12:43.712 --> 00:12:47.288
talks like this. It's absolutely fantastic.

00:12:49.488 --> 00:12:56.086
MARISHA: That's such a good Ed Wynn. I guess here
recently in Fire Emblem Fates (Effie voice) "I'm

00:12:56.086 --> 00:13:05.816
Effie who's a bro'd out, testosterone-pumping,
giant sword-wielding chick. I’m really obsessed

00:13:05.816 --> 00:13:11.576
with food all the time. So I got to do this all
the time and that was really great. She's really

00:13:11.576 --> 00:13:16.508
great." What's actually been really fun is I have
somebody-- cause, you know, in those games you

00:13:16.508 --> 00:13:22.473
tend to do two or three characters-- so I'm also
Oboro which is one of my Keyleth-y voice. and

00:13:22.473 --> 00:13:27.565
someone was like, "Marisha, you were great in Fire
Emblem: Fates. Oboro is amazing. I don't know who

00:13:27.565 --> 00:13:39.137
they got to do a voice for Effie, though." I was
like, "Hahaha!" and let it go.

00:13:41.237 --> 00:13:42.807
LAURA: That's terrible! I would cry.

00:13:45.477 --> 00:13:49.402
LAURA: Gosh I don't know. I think one of the most
fun times I ever had recording was for Shin-chan.

00:13:50.747 --> 00:13:52.620
MARISHA: One of my personal favorites of yours.

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:56.732
LAURA: (Shin-chan voice) Thank you so much. Yeah,
cause I just talked like I had a potato in my

00:13:56.732 --> 00:14:05.451
throat the whole time. Any shame I had was pretty
much left at the door. Travis, you didn't answer!

00:14:05.451 --> 00:14:15.011
TRAVIS: Oh shit. (Gazlowe voice) I like playing
Gazlowe. He's this really high character and he's

00:14:15.011 --> 00:14:17.620
a jerk so, you know. He talks like this!

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.593
MATT: Good question.

00:14:24.533 --> 00:14:30.182
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I wanted to know, on the day that
one of our beloved player characters happens to pass.

00:14:30.182 --> 00:14:30.781
LAURA: No!

00:14:30.781 --> 00:14:31.850
TRAVIS: You shut your mouth!

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:40.281
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Whether due to heroism or, in
Vax's case, impatience. Just wondering, what were

00:14:40.281 --> 00:14:42.652
your ideas for your next player character?

00:14:44.512 --> 00:14:50.010
MARISHA: Like 80 people in the audience go...
"We've all thought about this."

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:57.220
TALIESIN: I don't want to spoil. I'm not going to
lie, I've got very complicated ideas about this.

00:14:57.225 --> 00:14:58.505
TRAVIS: You do?!

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:01.821
TALIESIN: I've spent time thinking about what
I'm going to do when I finally fuck up.

00:15:02.601 --> 00:15:06.256
MATT: It is interesting. There's an aspect of
surprising you guys with whatever character they

00:15:06.256 --> 00:15:10.581
come up with. But whatever you feel like sharing.
You don't have to be specific, but you can be somewhat--

00:15:10.581 --> 00:15:13.671
TALIESIN: I like your Blood Hunter class, that's
what I'll share.

00:15:18.521 --> 00:15:26.262
MARISHA: I've thought about it. I've got a few
ideas. I have an idea for a bard that would be the

00:15:26.262 --> 00:15:33.944
whole opposite of Scanlan. I don't want to reveal
it too much.

00:15:33.944 --> 00:15:42.904
SAM: Well, I was going to come back as a druid
named Meyleth. It's going to be awesome.

00:15:42.904 --> 00:15:53.451
LAURA: I was thinking I was going to come back as
a tiefling, but I don't know, Zahra is so freaking cool.

00:15:53.718 --> 00:15:55.468
SAM: She’s not the only tiefling in the world.

00:15:55.468 --> 00:16:02.019
LAURA: Yeah, I know, but they're supposed to be
rare, right? So I might change it. I really want

00:16:02.019 --> 00:16:11.846
to be somebody with blue hair. I have ideas. A
were-bear with blue hair. That's going to be my name!

00:16:11.846 --> 00:16:22.937
TRAVIS: I was going to come back as Helga the
human bar wench and try to die as fast as

00:16:22.937 --> 00:16:25.597
possible. It's a horrible decision.

00:16:25.597 --> 00:16:34.458
MATT: We'll have to get Kit to do the art for the
one ten minute period she actually plays in the

00:16:34.458 --> 00:16:44.117
game. That's pretty funny, actually. I'll have to
kill you first. Hi, what you got?

00:16:45.497 --> 00:16:49.192
AUDIENCE MEMBER: So, Laura, if you want to play
someone with blue hair, you could always do a

00:16:49.192 --> 00:17:08.875
water genasi. Also, go Geminis. My question is to
all of you, it's a D&amp;D question. Vox Machina's

00:17:09.104 --> 00:17:16.905
obviously made up of a lot of very diverse
personalities and people with very different ways

00:17:16.905 --> 00:17:22.958
of looking about things, going about goals that
sometimes may not always exactly line up with each

00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:33.344
other. So what are your guys' strategies--and
Matt, what are your strategies as a DM--for making

00:17:33.344 --> 00:17:46.286
sure that all of your characters are still
working towards the same goal and keeping

00:17:46.286 --> 00:17:51.641
things amicable while at the same time staying
true to your characters?

00:17:53.771 --> 00:17:59.574
TALIESIN: We have a Fight Club on set. We can't
talk about it.

00:18:05.228 --> 00:18:10.131
LAURA: I think that's one of the most fun things
about playing is that everybody has their own

00:18:10.131 --> 00:18:19.414
moral code and we're trying to make that all mesh
together to the same goal. If we think, as our

00:18:19.414 --> 00:18:33.094
character, that something's okay and Keyleth
definitely does not, then I think that's fine, to

00:18:33.094 --> 00:18:38.862
see how that plays out and see why somebody would
have a problem with somebody else's actions.

00:18:39.472 --> 00:18:48.123
MARISHA: Yeah, amicable is hard because we all do
have our personal goals that we're thinking of all

00:18:48.123 --> 00:18:53.194
the time. And... being someone with a moral
compass is very difficult.

00:18:54.674 --> 00:19:00.242
LAURA: Vex is a really good person! She's a really
good person. Don't you shake your head.

00:19:00.242 --> 00:19:01.472
(laughter)

00:19:01.472 --> 00:19:04.482
MARISHA: She's saying it for herself,
I'm pretty sure.

00:19:06.442 --> 00:19:09.773
TALIESIN: We snicker about it backstage when we're
done. We're like, "Oh wow, that was intense."

00:19:11.493 --> 00:19:22.391
MARISHA: We love it. It's hard to answer. Right
before the dragons, there was a moment where I was

00:19:22.391 --> 00:19:30.663
like, "I don't know. I'm having a hard time
justifying Keyleth staying around." Because there

00:19:30.663 --> 00:19:37.112
was a lot of animosity in the group. It's funny
how things can turn out like petty little

00:19:37.112 --> 00:19:39.253
squabbles after the world is burning to the
ground.

00:19:41.253 --> 00:19:47.343
MATT: Which plays into my answer as well. I don't
want to drive the players to a specific goal or

00:19:47.343 --> 00:19:53.663
shoehorn them in. Let them play in their field. I
love inter-party conflict. For those who saw the

00:19:53.663 --> 00:20:04.563
Percy-Grog standoff, I was mentally eating popcorn
the entire time.

00:20:04.563 --> 00:20:06.711
(laughter)

00:20:06.711 --> 00:20:08.082
MATT: It was awesome.

00:20:08.492 --> 00:20:09.871
TALIESIN: I was so ready for that.

00:20:09.871 --> 00:20:11.282
(laughter)

00:20:11.282 --> 00:20:15.653
MATT: I love inter-party conflict, and I never
want to dissuade players from that. If characters

00:20:15.653 --> 00:20:18.573
have to leave for a while from the game, that's
totally fine too. They can play a different

00:20:18.573 --> 00:20:23.482
character for a while, and when they feel the
other character wants to return, they can. Or if

00:20:23.482 --> 00:20:27.312
the other character ends up becoming an antagonist
to the party that's also a cool twist. I've had

00:20:27.312 --> 00:20:31.013
that happen in previous games, where all of a
sudden, a player character got so fed up with the

00:20:31.013 --> 00:20:35.083
party they left, and they came back six months
down the line as an antagonist to the party,

00:20:35.083 --> 00:20:39.774
trying to stop them from making such poor
decisions in the future. Then they became a DM

00:20:39.774 --> 00:20:42.282
controlled character, and the person was fighting
against their old character!

00:20:42.282 --> 00:20:44.582
(laughter)

00:20:46.722 --> 00:20:49.951
MATT: So, I love watching the dynamic happen and I
don't want to dissuade players from finding their

00:20:49.951 --> 00:20:54.043
characters out and work with them to whatever the
ramifications of those discussions are.

00:20:55.493 --> 00:20:55.992
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.

00:20:55.992 --> 00:20:56.622
MATT: Thank you.

00:21:02.692 --> 00:21:05.045
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I don't have a D&amp;D question, I
have an acting question.

00:21:05.045 --> 00:21:05.482
TRAVIS: Yeah!

00:21:06.722 --> 00:21:10.408
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We were actually talking with
some other Critters last night about doing theater

00:21:10.408 --> 00:21:14.917
and things and a while back I played Eddie in a
little show you might know as The Rocky Horror

00:21:14.917 --> 00:21:15.391
Picture Show.

00:21:15.391 --> 00:21:18.789
(applause)

00:21:18.789 --> 00:21:24.967
AUDIENCE MEMBER: So, the weirdness that goes on
backstage at a Rocky Horror show--

00:21:24.967 --> 00:21:25.767
MATT: Oh yeah.

00:21:26.688 --> 00:21:29.428
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Because it's just as weird
backstage as it is on stage. It got me thinking,

00:21:29.428 --> 00:21:36.277
what's the weirdest, strangest, most out of left
field role, voice, or character that you guys have

00:21:36.277 --> 00:21:37.008
ever played?

00:21:38.208 --> 00:21:41.147
MATT: There was a time when Percy went to buy
black powder in Vasselheim.

00:21:41.147 --> 00:21:50.537
(applause)

00:21:52.377 --> 00:21:58.488
SAM: Uhh... I played Tiger Woods in a--

00:21:58.488 --> 00:22:02.596
(laughter)

00:22:02.596 --> 00:22:04.389
TALIESIN: Are you really about to admit to this?

00:22:04.389 --> 00:22:05.948
SAM: ...In blackface.

00:22:05.948 --> 00:22:08.807
(laughter/groaning)

00:22:08.807 --> 00:22:10.108
SAM: Or brownface. In brownface.

00:22:10.108 --> 00:22:11.448
(laughter/groaning)

00:22:11.448 --> 00:22:12.635
TALIESIN: This is on the internet.

00:22:12.635 --> 00:22:15.538
(laughter/groaning)

00:22:15.538 --> 00:22:16.688
SAM: I rapped.

00:22:16.688 --> 00:22:18.668
MATT: You might want to mention who produced
this.

00:22:18.668 --> 00:22:22.107
SAM: Uhh... Will.I.Am produced it.

00:22:22.107 --> 00:22:28.487
(laughter/groaning)

00:22:28.487 --> 00:22:29.500
MATT: Oh my god. Tigga Hoods.

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.718
(laughter)

00:22:31.718 --> 00:22:34.859
TALIESIN: I have never actually heard you admit to
this before. I've watched it so many times.

00:22:34.859 --> 00:22:38.513
(laughter)

00:22:38.513 --> 00:22:46.011
SAM: That same year I played a Mexican man...
named Barrio. In a break-dancing movie called

00:22:46.011 --> 00:22:47.689
Freak Dance, which you can also find online.

00:22:47.689 --> 00:22:48.685
MARISHA: Oh my god!

00:22:48.685 --> 00:22:50.487
(laughter)

00:22:50.487 --> 00:22:51.718
SAM: Also in brownface.

00:22:51.718 --> 00:22:54.108
(laughter/groaning)

00:22:54.108 --> 00:22:57.877
SAM: Hey, it was... during a dark time.

00:22:57.877 --> 00:23:08.487
(laughter/groaning)

00:23:08.487 --> 00:23:11.425
MATT: I don’t know if we have a panel after that.

00:23:12.505 --> 00:23:17.097
TALIESIN: We actually had a little bet going
because you're such a well of interesting YouTube.

00:23:17.097 --> 00:23:18.537
(laughter)

00:23:18.537 --> 00:23:22.858
TALIESIN: Your YouTube well goes deep and I was
wondering how long it's going to take--

00:23:22.858 --> 00:23:24.947
SAM: I mean, I was in my underwear singing about
IKEA.

00:23:24.947 --> 00:23:26.458
(laughter)

00:23:26.458 --> 00:23:28.339
TALIESIN: There's so much! There's <i>so</i> much!

00:23:30.509 --> 00:23:35.470
MATT: Yeah, like, Critters found your Craig
Ferguson appearance. Yeah, you're all over the

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:36.089
place man.

00:23:38.479 --> 00:23:39.997
SAM: I say yes to any job.

00:23:39.997 --> 00:23:42.746
(laughter)

00:23:42.746 --> 00:23:44.087
MATT: Laura what do you have?

00:23:44.087 --> 00:23:45.648
LAURA: Oh man, I've got to keep thinking.

00:23:45.648 --> 00:23:47.097
TALIESIN: I know, that's so dark.

00:23:48.217 --> 00:23:50.349
MATT: Yeah, we're done. That's it, next question.

00:23:52.729 --> 00:23:53.487
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hey guys.

00:23:53.487 --> 00:23:54.637
MATT: Hello.

00:23:56.497 --> 00:23:59.888
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Most of you, I believe, have done
some really amazing work with Blizzard and I want

00:23:59.888 --> 00:24:01.208
to thank you for that.

00:24:01.208 --> 00:24:07.487
(applause)

00:24:08.477 --> 00:24:11.466
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Matt knew this question was
coming because I told him about it last night,

00:24:11.466 --> 00:24:14.519
(Scottish accent) but what's your favorite accent
to play?

00:24:20.219 --> 00:24:21.637
MATT: (Scottish accent) You've already answered
mine.

00:24:21.637 --> 00:24:23.738
(laughter)

00:24:23.738 --> 00:24:27.090
MATT: Brogue is fantastic, I have yet to play a
dwarf in any sort of Blizzard franchise and it's

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:28.209
<i>killing</i> me.

00:24:28.209 --> 00:24:30.140
(laughter)

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:33.340
MATT: I play orcs up and down the day, but they
haven't given me a dwarf yet.

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:35.948
TALIESIN: We let you do the Scottish accent for
one game.

00:24:37.238 --> 00:24:42.105
MATT: (Scottish accent) Oh, that's right! 
(normal voice) Yeah, for Akiba's Trip, which is a Japanese

00:24:42.105 --> 00:24:44.530
game where you beat up vampires to make them
naked which kills them because the sun touches

00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:45.530
their skin.

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:48.197
(laughter)

00:24:48.197 --> 00:24:54.091
MATT: In the game you can unlock voices for NPCs.
You can set the voice mode for different NPCs.

00:24:54.091 --> 00:24:58.217
Like, you go into a maid cafe, and this cute
little moe maid, and you can give her a

00:24:58.217 --> 00:25:00.535
(Scottish accent) big tough Scottish voice.

00:25:00.535 --> 00:25:01.770
(laughter)

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:06.138
MATT: (Scottish accent) "Would you like some tea
with that, lass? Oh, you look tense, how about a massage?"

00:25:06.138 --> 00:25:08.687
(laughter)

00:25:08.687 --> 00:25:10.908
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Scottish accent) Never change
Matt. Never change.

00:25:10.908 --> 00:25:12.707
MATT: Haha, I don't have a choice.

00:25:12.707 --> 00:25:14.390
(laughter)

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:16.319
SAM: Accents? I can't do accents.

00:25:16.319 --> 00:25:17.058
MATT: There you go.

00:25:17.058 --> 00:25:19.749
SAM: (terrible Boston accent) All my accents sound
like I'm from Boston.

00:25:19.749 --> 00:25:23.077
(laughter)

00:25:23.077 --> 00:25:33.427
SAM: (terrible Boston-accented mumbling)

00:25:33.427 --> 00:25:35.237
MARISHA: It's like a John Waters film.

00:25:35.237 --> 00:25:36.756
SAM: Everyone from Boston [inaudible]

00:25:37.026 --> 00:25:40.264
(laughter/groaning)

00:25:40.264 --> 00:25:40.766
MATT: Sam!

00:25:40.766 --> 00:25:45.615
LAURA: I am never doing a panel with Sam Riegel
ever again. Ever.

00:25:45.906 --> 00:25:55.625
SAM: I love you Boston. I'm just terrible at
accents. I've also done British a lot. Just

00:25:55.625 --> 00:25:56.735
terribly badly.

00:25:56.735 --> 00:25:59.305
(laughter)

00:25:59.305 --> 00:26:00.555
LAURA: I don't even know.

00:26:00.555 --> 00:26:02.486
(laughter)

00:26:02.486 --> 00:26:04.595
MARISHA: I'm with Sam. American.

00:26:04.595 --> 00:26:06.401
(laughter)

00:26:06.401 --> 00:26:07.504
MARISHA: That's my favorite one.

00:26:07.504 --> 00:26:10.555
TALIESIN: (West Country accent) I like West
Country. Any time you sound like a hobbit it's great.

00:26:11.055 --> 00:26:13.673
MATT: I don't know. I think Marisha's Scottish is
pretty great.

00:26:13.673 --> 00:26:15.087
(laughter)

00:26:15.087 --> 00:26:16.245
MARISHA: (Swedish accent) Oh no!

00:26:16.245 --> 00:26:19.336
(laughter)

00:26:19.336 --> 00:26:21.314
MARISHA: (Swedish accent) Oh no, I'm from
Scotland.

00:26:21.314 --> 00:26:22.574
LAURA: Is that Swedish?

00:26:22.574 --> 00:26:25.126
MARISHA: (Swedish accent) Swedish? Yeah, Swedish.

00:26:32.496 --> 00:26:37.779
MATT: Sorry. Travis?

00:26:38.372 --> 00:26:43.769
TRAVIS: (Southern accent) I would like to be
Southern. A Southern son of a bitch.

00:26:43.769 --> 00:26:48.712
(laughter)

00:26:48.712 --> 00:26:52.132
MATT: Good question, thanks man.

00:26:52.352 --> 00:26:53.062
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hello.

00:26:53.062 --> 00:26:53.792
MATT: Hello.

00:26:53.792 --> 00:27:00.570
AUDIENCE MEMBER: First off, I would like to thank
you on behalf of everybody you inspired to start

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:02.045
playing D&amp;D as a hobby.

00:27:02.045 --> 00:27:08.568
(applause)

00:27:08.568 --> 00:27:12.462
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I have a question specifically
for Mr. Mercer up there.

00:27:12.462 --> 00:27:13.162
MATT: All right.

00:27:13.162 --> 00:27:20.213
AUDIENCE MEMBER: So, I know the longsword or
whatever, Craven Edge, that you've given Grog has

00:27:20.213 --> 00:27:27.633
very similar traits to a Black Blade build from
Pathfinder, so I was wondering if that was the

00:27:27.633 --> 00:27:34.691
next class you were trying to introduce to 5th
Edition like with Percy's Gunslinger.

00:27:34.691 --> 00:27:41.180
MATT: With Craven Edge, I really wanted to put an
intelligent weapon in the campaign, because that

00:27:41.442 --> 00:27:45.720
hasn't happened before and they hadn't encountered
one. So that was a homebrew creation, Craven Edge.

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:52.970
I don't have a lot of time to work on homebrew
stuff, and the Bloodhunter took a lot out of me.

00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:58.340
It was a very good learning experience and if time
allows I would like to do something more. I will

00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:03.928
say I am currently working on a new Order for the
Bloodhunter. I guess I'll say it here, why not,

00:28:03.928 --> 00:28:11.195
I'll be done soon. It's called the Order of Lycan
which specifies, essentially, a Bloodhunter Order

00:28:11.195 --> 00:28:15.650
that accepts the curse of lycanthropy, and uses
their training and blood magic to control it.

00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:22.290
(laughter)

00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:26.506
MATT: Or a were-tiger, you choose whatever type
you want, it doesn't affect the Order so much.

00:28:26.506 --> 00:28:28.019
LAURA: That is definitely going to be Travis's
next class.

00:28:28.019 --> 00:28:30.640
(laughter)

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:35.148
MATT: It'll be a fun class, I'm working out the
dynamics of it. Essentially, they can go into the

00:28:35.148 --> 00:28:40.529
were form for a short time. If they take damage
during the form they have to roll to see if they

00:28:40.529 --> 00:28:42.510
go into a bloodlust rage next turn.

00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:48.431
It's hard to control that form when you embrace
the curse, people. So anyway, that's a little

00:28:48.431 --> 00:28:49.399
exclusive there for you.

00:28:49.399 --> 00:28:54.662
(applause)

00:28:54.662 --> 00:29:03.460
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hey guys, I wanted to thank you
guys super quickly for coming out here to

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:05.224
Portland. It's great to see you guys.

00:29:05.224 --> 00:29:06.560
(applause)

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.309
MATT: Thanks for having us.

00:29:08.309 --> 00:29:18.760
AUDIENCE MEMBER: So, I do have a question for all
of you. Do you guys play/watch the final product

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:24.131
you voice in, and if so, what is your experience
while watching or playing the game?

00:29:24.131 --> 00:29:26.928
TRAVIS: Weird. It's always weird.

00:29:28.534 --> 00:29:31.155
LAURA: It depends on the project really. Like, if
we play it or not. If I play it or not.

00:29:31.155 --> 00:29:38.197
TALIESIN: I don't think I play anything I'm
specifically in, but sometimes I'm in things that I play.

00:29:38.197 --> 00:29:42.466
MATT: Yeah, that's more the case.

00:29:42.466 --> 00:29:45.475
TRAVIS: We suffer from the same thing that
everyone else does where we hear ourselves in a

00:29:45.475 --> 00:29:50.494
project and we're like whoa, that sounds weird! I
don't know! You always want to go back and do it a

00:29:50.494 --> 00:29:54.786
million times. Yeah, if it's a franchise we love,
we're definitely playing it and hating

00:29:54.786 --> 00:29:55.815
the sound of our voice.

00:29:55.815 --> 00:29:58.247
(laughter)

00:29:58.247 --> 00:30:01.235
TALIESIN: We recognize everybody in it so it's
weird because you're like, "Oh yeah, there's--"

00:30:01.235 --> 00:30:02.609
MARISHA:: Shut up, Steve Bloom.

00:30:02.609 --> 00:30:05.096
(laughter)

00:30:05.096 --> 00:30:12.210
TALIESIN: You're snarky in Battlefront. I
occasionally find myself going, "I know, Marisha."

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:14.076
(laughter)

00:30:14.076 --> 00:30:18.344
MARISHA: They used like, all of my snarky lines
too. They just wanted "You should really be back

00:30:18.344 --> 00:30:24.235
fighting with the rest of your team. Where are you
going? Oh, thanks, cool. Bye. You're such an asshole."

00:30:24.235 --> 00:30:26.034
(laughter)

00:30:26.034 --> 00:30:27.704
TRAVIS: Sam loves the sound of his own voice.

00:30:27.704 --> 00:30:29.494
SAM: I do, I'm really good.

00:30:29.494 --> 00:30:31.785
(laughter)

00:30:31.785 --> 00:30:38.925
SAM: I watch a lot of stuff that I'm in and I'm
like, "Yeah, yeah, that's right. Spot on again, Riegel."

00:30:38.925 --> 00:30:41.556
(laughter)

00:30:41.556 --> 00:30:49.170
MATT: Yeah, the shut up light has been our running
joke for a long time. "Shut up, Travis. Shut up,

00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:52.266
"Laura. Shut up, Troy."

00:30:52.266 --> 00:30:52.994
MARISHA: "Shut up, Matt."

00:30:52.994 --> 00:30:53.977
MATT: "Shut up, me."

00:30:53.977 --> 00:30:55.356
(laughter)

00:30:55.356 --> 00:31:05.085
SAM: Me and Travis, once or twice, played Call of
Duty online and it was super confusing.

00:31:05.085 --> 00:31:10.924
(laughter)

00:31:10.924 --> 00:31:15.706
SAM: Travis would be yelling "They're over
there!", and then I'd be like, "Wait, are they?"

00:31:15.706 --> 00:31:18.185
(laughter)

00:31:18.185 --> 00:31:23.016
SAM: He'd be like, "No, that was me in the game."
Liam would say something and

00:31:23.016 --> 00:31:24.545
we would be like, "Wait, what?"

00:31:24.545 --> 00:31:26.337
(laughter)

00:31:26.337 --> 00:31:27.836
SAM: "Are you on my team or not?"

00:31:27.836 --> 00:31:29.035
(laughter)

00:31:29.035 --> 00:31:31.086
SAM: Very, very confusing.

00:31:31.086 --> 00:31:33.585
(laughter)

00:31:33.585 --> 00:31:35.035
MATT: Good question, thank you.

00:31:35.035 --> 00:31:40.148
LAURA: When I was playing Fallout, I don't have
any companions except for my dog, because I don't

00:31:40.148 --> 00:31:47.975
like people. Then I felt really guilty when I got
to you and was like, "Oh, shit, Matt, (sigh)." I

00:31:47.975 --> 00:31:53.406
sent my dog home so that I could make you my
companion. The minute my dog left my side I was

00:31:53.406 --> 00:31:58.745
like, "No, go away Matt!" I dismissed you and went
back to him.

00:31:58.745 --> 00:31:59.395
(laughter)

00:31:59.395 --> 00:32:02.494
MATT: It's totally fine, you would have gotten
really sick of me very early from going "(sigh),

00:32:02.494 --> 00:32:07.864
do you need to carry all this junk?" Like, get
away Matt. Go home. Stay at the Red Rocket.

00:32:07.864 --> 00:32:11.835
LAURA: The dog does not complain when you give him
so many weapons to hold.

00:32:11.835 --> 00:32:15.075
MATT: No, but he does complain every time he gets
hit and you have to hear that (dog whimpering noise).

00:32:15.075 --> 00:32:16.233
LAURA: I know.

00:32:16.233 --> 00:32:19.615
LAURA: When he whines and you feel so bad, and
then you don't want to waste your stimpacks

00:32:19.615 --> 00:32:22.304
because you know he'll heal really fast, and
you're watching your dog like--

00:32:22.304 --> 00:32:26.986
MATT: That's why I couldn't do it. I don't care
about watching people getting murdered in the

00:32:26.986 --> 00:32:29.826
middle of the wasteland, but that dog, I can't do
it.

00:32:29.826 --> 00:32:35.168
LAURA: Then you're running around, and you get on
an elevator, and the dog looks at you like--

00:32:35.457 --> 00:32:38.648
MATT: Well you mean it’s not as cool as any of
your weird companions going--

00:32:38.926 --> 00:32:42.083
(laughter)

00:32:42.517 --> 00:32:48.657
SAM: If you have a-- No, no, I'm sorry, you go.

00:32:48.657 --> 00:32:51.239
MARISHA: No, no, I didn't mean to jump over top of
you. You go.

00:32:51.239 --> 00:32:52.087
SAM: No, I--

00:32:52.087 --> 00:32:53.006
MARISHA: No, please.

00:32:53.006 --> 00:32:54.630
SAM: No, no.

00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:55.948
MATT: Next question, what's up?

00:32:55.948 --> 00:32:57.957
(laughter)

00:32:57.957 --> 00:33:01.177
SAM: I was just going to say, we have five
minutes. We only have time for a couple more questions.

00:33:01.177 --> 00:33:03.479
TRAVIS: We'll try and answer quickly. Lightning
round!

00:33:03.479 --> 00:33:11.959
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi. That line is so long that
I've thought up about 10 million questions. Have

00:33:11.959 --> 00:33:24.058
any of your characters in D&amp;D held secrets from
the rest of the group?

00:33:24.058 --> 00:33:26.478
ENTIRE PANEL: Yes!

00:33:26.478 --> 00:33:27.770
MARISHA: All the time.

00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:29.726
TALIESIN: They still do. Right now.

00:33:29.726 --> 00:33:31.297
MARISHA: Right now, yes.

00:33:31.297 --> 00:33:32.166
LAURA: I’m a dragon.

00:33:32.166 --> 00:33:35.379
(laughter)

00:33:35.379 --> 00:33:44.448
SAM: Secrets are the best. You ma'am.

00:33:44.448 --> 00:33:49.827
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I know I asked all of you
yesterday, but I'm really interesting in voice

00:33:49.827 --> 00:33:57.688
acting, and you said theater, theater, theater.
Are there any good online resources? Either forums

00:33:57.688 --> 00:34:02.857
you can do, or other resources?

00:34:02.857 --> 00:34:06.598
MATT: A good website you can go to for an overall
view of the industry and getting into it is

00:34:06.598 --> 00:34:10.677
iwanttobeavoiceactor.com, run by Dee Bradley
Baker, one of the most prolific

00:34:10.677 --> 00:34:12.449
voice actors in the industry.

00:34:12.449 --> 00:34:13.946
LAURA: He is amazing.

00:34:13.946 --> 00:34:16.678
MATT: So that's a really good place to start.
There aren't that many people out there who can do

00:34:16.678 --> 00:34:20.138
online workshops and classes with you. Just make
sure that anyone who's offering you a class, you

00:34:20.138 --> 00:34:25.887
research their work and see that one: they're
reputable, two: they are working in the industry,

00:34:25.887 --> 00:34:28.537
and three: that they're not charging way too
much.

00:34:28.537 --> 00:34:31.757
LAURA: Because there are a lot of people who don't
actually work very much that will do classes and

00:34:31.757 --> 00:34:34.408
you won't learn very much.

00:34:34.408 --> 00:34:39.157
AUDIENCE MEMBER: So what's a good portfolio to
look at to get examples from?

00:34:39.157 --> 00:34:41.217
TRAVIS: Just a crap load of credits.

00:34:41.217 --> 00:34:46.856
LAURA: Or you can look up voiceover agencies and a
lot of the agencies will have demo reels of their

00:34:46.856 --> 00:34:51.641
actors that they represent, and then you can go on
and listen to what the demos should sound like,

00:34:51.641 --> 00:34:54.278
but you'll want to send out to agencies in order
to--

00:34:54.278 --> 00:35:01.197
SAM: Voicebank.net. That has everyone's reel that
you've ever heard. It has all their demo reels,

00:35:01.197 --> 00:35:06.078
you just have to find them. And also, you can buy
Yuri Lowenthal and Tara Platt--

00:35:06.078 --> 00:35:07.467
LAURA: I said that one yesterday.

00:35:07.467 --> 00:35:08.478
SAM: What was it though?

00:35:08.478 --> 00:35:10.347
MATT and LAURA: Voice Over Voice Actor.

00:35:10.347 --> 00:35:12.376
LAURA: What It’s Like Behind the Mic, or
something?

00:35:12.376 --> 00:35:17.825
TALIESIN: What It’s Like Behind the Mic, yeah.
It’s a great book. It’s really for right

00:35:17.825 --> 00:35:20.186
where you are, mentally.

00:35:20.186 --> 00:35:21.986
LAURA: Travis!

00:35:21.986 --> 00:35:22.927
(laughter)

00:35:22.927 --> 00:35:24.147
TRAVIS: Book?

00:35:24.147 --> 00:35:25.866
(laughter)

00:35:25.866 --> 00:35:30.027
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hello!

00:35:30.027 --> 00:35:31.547
PANEL: Hello!

00:35:31.547 --> 00:35:38.257
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I had a personal question for all
of you. There’s this thing that happens sometimes

00:35:38.257 --> 00:35:48.207
when you’re an artist, where you have a lot of
self-doubt. When did you identify yourself as a

00:35:48.207 --> 00:35:52.798
voice actor? Was there a moment? Is there a little
story or a snip or a time where you were like,

00:35:52.798 --> 00:35:55.907
“Yeah, I think I just did it.”

00:35:55.907 --> 00:35:58.117
MARISHA: You guys, I think I made it.

00:35:58.117 --> 00:35:59.978
(laughter)

00:35:59.978 --> 00:36:05.658
MARISHA: Yeah, that’s hard because we’re always
still working to keep going. You can’t ever stop

00:36:05.658 --> 00:36:10.963
working. So none of us-- I don’t think any of us
are just like, “Yeah! We can stop now.”

00:36:10.963 --> 00:36:16.918
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I don’t mean “You can stop,” or
“I’m done. I’ve hit the peak,” but the moment you

00:36:16.918 --> 00:36:23.257
go from thinking of yourself as a squib to being
“I am actually an actor.”

00:36:23.257 --> 00:36:24.857
TALIESIN: If I hit it, I’ll let you know.

00:36:24.857 --> 00:36:26.518
(laughter)

00:36:26.518 --> 00:36:30.658
MATT: I think the closest thing I can say is the
moment that I quit my day job, after saving up for

00:36:30.658 --> 00:36:38.516
months to downsize to a tiny apartment and decide
that this was-- it’s now or never. Before I had

00:36:38.516 --> 00:36:43.539
the regrets of never really trying. I’m going to
put all of my power and energy into this, and go

00:36:43.539 --> 00:36:46.928
through the hardships. If it doesn’t work out, at
least I can live the rest of my life knowing that

00:36:46.928 --> 00:36:51.178
I gave it a shot, as opposed to wondering what
could’ve been. And so, though it wasn’t--

00:36:51.178 --> 00:36:53.956
(applause)

00:36:53.956 --> 00:36:58.187
MATT: It wasn’t an easy time. And it was a very
prolonged piece of time of not getting peace and

00:36:58.187 --> 00:37:02.588
time, but I think taking that big enough step to
go ahead and try for a passion like that was the

00:37:02.588 --> 00:37:04.868
moment where I was like, “Now I’m an actor.
Because I’m poor.”

00:37:04.868 --> 00:37:06.908
(laughter)

00:37:06.908 --> 00:37:15.478
LAURA: Yeah. You have that moment of being able to
not have another job and just your acting job.

00:37:15.478 --> 00:37:18.318
That’s when you go, “Okay. This is something I can
actually--”

00:37:18.318 --> 00:37:22.778
TALIESIN: When you cut down all of your expenses
to the point of which, you’re like, “Okay. Now I can live.”

00:37:22.778 --> 00:37:29.447
MARISHA: “Now I can survive.” Yeah. I found that,
as time goes on, and as I keep working, that I’m

00:37:29.447 --> 00:37:35.327
having a harder and harder time just identifying
with any one thing. I can’t <i>just</i> call myself a

00:37:35.327 --> 00:37:41.016
voice actor, because a lot of us, we’re directors,
writers, producers--

00:37:41.016 --> 00:37:42.497
TALIESIN: Professional D&amp;D players.

00:37:42.497 --> 00:37:49.528
MARISHA: Professional D&amp;D players. So I kind of
feel that saying voice acting-- and this goes for

00:37:49.528 --> 00:37:56.799
any artists out there-- don’t adhere to it so much
that you end up limiting yourself in the long run,

00:37:56.799 --> 00:38:01.372
because it can bleed into other areas.

00:38:01.372 --> 00:38:02.727
(applause)

00:38:02.727 --> 00:38:04.529
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.

00:38:05.728 --> 00:38:08.998
MATT: Last question.

00:38:08.998 --> 00:38:12.109
AUDIENCE MEMBER: It’s not really a question, per
se. Matt, I finally brought your sword and a

00:38:12.109 --> 00:38:15.818
Sierra League-looking scabbard. Do you mind if I
give it to you now?

00:38:16.066 --> 00:38:18.078
MATT: Bring it!

00:38:18.078 --> 00:38:19.278
LAURA: Give it!

00:38:19.278 --> 00:38:21.888
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Also, Laura. I have my
seven-year-old and my ten-year-old daughters. They

00:38:21.888 --> 00:38:24.399
drew you a picture from Glitter Force.

00:38:24.399 --> 00:38:27.117
LAURA: Oh my god!

00:38:27.117 --> 00:38:28.468
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I was wondering if I could bring
that.

00:38:28.468 --> 00:38:32.051
LAURA: Hi girls! I want to see what you drew!

00:38:32.051 --> 00:38:35.138
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Is it okay if I come up?

00:38:35.376 --> 00:38:39.968
MATT: Approacheth. For those of you that didn’t
get your question answered, we’re going back to

00:38:39.968 --> 00:38:43.857
our tables to sign this afternoon so just come by
and say hello and we can answer your questions there.

00:38:43.857 --> 00:38:48.948
LAURA: I think we’re stopping at 2:30, and that’s
when we have to head to the airport.

00:38:48.948 --> 00:38:50.307
SAM: So we’ll try to fly through everybody.

00:38:50.307 --> 00:38:51.187
LAURA: Yeah, we’ll try to be fast.

00:38:51.187 --> 00:38:54.817
(applause)

00:38:54.817 --> 00:38:57.627
MARISHA: Oh snap! How are you going to get that on
the plane?

00:38:57.627 --> 00:39:00.931
MATT: I don’t know.

00:39:00.931 --> 00:39:04.238
LAURA: Aww, look at these glitter-tastic
pictures!

00:39:04.238 --> 00:39:05.777
TALIESIN: Oh my god, it’s so cute!

00:39:05.777 --> 00:39:08.384
LAURA: Glitter duckies!

00:39:08.384 --> 00:39:15.608
(cheers, applause)

00:39:15.608 --> 00:39:18.240
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Travis and Marisha, you two share
that--

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:21.477
MARISHA: Do you want us to share that? Do you
think he’s going to share that with me?

00:39:21.477 --> 00:39:22.547
(laughter)

00:39:22.547 --> 00:39:25.997
AUDIENCE MEMBER: This is a [inaudible]

00:39:25.997 --> 00:39:27.367
LAURA: What!

00:39:27.367 --> 00:39:32.900
MARISHA: Hey babe, we’re going to share this.

00:39:37.652 --> 00:39:47.561
MATT: Thank you so much! Okay guys, thank you all
so much for coming to our panel, and for coming to

00:39:47.561 --> 00:39:50.857
visit us here at Wizard World. We absolutely
appreciate the opportunity to meet all of you.

00:39:50.857 --> 00:39:51.849
MARISHA: You guys are amazing!

00:39:51.849 --> 00:39:59.247
(cheering)

00:39:59.247 --> 00:40:02.517

that, we’ll see you online guys.

00:40:02.517 --> 00:40:09.039
