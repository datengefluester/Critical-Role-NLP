1
00:00:00,318 --> 00:00:06,649
MATT: Welcome, everyone, to a kind of Critical
Role. (laughs) Critical Rejects, and/or the

2
00:00:06,649 --> 00:00:11,337
delightful return of some interesting characters
and some fresh faces you'll see here in a second.

3
00:00:11,337 --> 00:00:16,683
Tonight, as part of the Extra Life Charity Stream,
we're going to be running a one-shot game,

4
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:25,644
continuing the current crazed adventures of the
illustrious Vox Moronica. (laughs) It should be

5
00:00:25,644 --> 00:00:31,538
some interesting fun in that regard. Let's see, I
don't think we have much else to announce, other

6
00:00:31,538 --> 00:00:34,201
than we're going for our next goal at 60,000.

7
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:39,379
ZAC: If we hit it, Felicia has promised to come do
a Rock Band concert for us.

8
00:00:39,379 --> 00:00:44,964
MATT: Felicia is going to do a Rock Band concert
if we hit 60k tonight. I'm vying to maybe be the

9
00:00:44,964 --> 00:00:49,484
drummer for that, because I'm pretty good at
drums, and by that I mean I'll destroy them. Good

10
00:00:49,484 --> 00:00:53,113
or bad, you'll find out, but let's see if we hit
60k. Felicia will do that, it would be awesome.

11
00:00:53,113 --> 00:00:57,092
You guys have already been fantastic, blowing
through the goals as we have, so we'll see how

12
00:00:57,092 --> 00:01:01,186
much this momentum of positive awesomeness we can
carry through to the end of the stream tonight.

13
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:08,309
And as part of that, let's go ahead and bring ourselves
into the mood for some Critical Rejects.

14
00:01:08,309 --> 00:02:17,918
[dramatic music]

15
00:02:17,918 --> 00:02:26,892
MATT: Okay. Welcome. For those who weren't here
for the initial, completely improvised

16
00:02:26,892 --> 00:02:34,584
introduction of Vox Moronica, these wonderful
characters, we have Dan Casey here who plays Salty

17
00:02:34,584 --> 00:02:38,394
Pete. If you want to give a brief little
description of your character and what you're about.

18
00:02:38,394 --> 00:02:43,816
DAN: For those who don't know, I'm a pirate. Well,
formerly a pirate. My name's Salty Pete, some call

19
00:02:43,816 --> 00:02:50,616
me Sam, Money Sam if you're this guy over here.
And I am trying to get my ship back. I lost it in

20
00:02:50,616 --> 00:02:56,109
a bet. I play for pink slips, and I'm missing a
few fingers, which you may remember from our

21
00:02:56,109 --> 00:03:05,603
previous adventure. They were unceremoniously cut
off. Classic, I know. Classic times. That's me in

22
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:07,076
a nutshell.

23
00:03:07,076 --> 00:03:08,880
MATT: Fantastic.

24
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,432
DAN: This is me in a mimed nutshell. I'll be here
all night.

25
00:03:13,432 --> 00:03:18,164
MATT: All right, and following that up, we have in
the center over here the illustrious Snugglelord,

26
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:20,809
if you want to go ahead and give us a rundown of
what you're all about.

27
00:03:20,809 --> 00:03:22,791
ZAC: Well, you can call me Snugglelord.

28
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:25,465
DAN: (laughs) He just did!

29
00:03:25,465 --> 00:03:33,006
ZAC: Damn it! That was my intro. I'm a warlock
tiefling who used to be the prince of a land, and

30
00:03:33,006 --> 00:03:43,008
I impregnated all the impregnable, and I got
bored, and given the strong word of my wonderful

31
00:03:43,008 --> 00:03:52,076
and empowering leader, the Shathrum-- my god, per
se-- I decided to leave and go on a great journey

32
00:03:52,076 --> 00:03:57,312
to find these riches that the Shathrum had
promised me. And that's when I picked up these

33
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:03,491
dum-dums and paid them to be my personal
bodyguards because I don't like to mess with the

34
00:04:03,491 --> 00:04:05,239
riff-raff and things like that.

35
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:11,957
MATT: Fantastic. That is our illustrious
Snugglelord. And to his left we have, returning,

36
00:04:11,957 --> 00:04:15,761
the wondrous, talented, and very forceful
personality--

37
00:04:15,761 --> 00:04:24,194
IFY: Ulfgar Fireforge, baby. Money talks, bullshit
walks. Ex-pit fighter, now I'm a sellsword. Bring

38
00:04:24,194 --> 00:04:28,806
the money to the table and Imma take it and Imma
do whatever you need me to do. Whatever, no

39
00:04:28,806 --> 00:04:34,337
questions asked, just put the money on the table, and
we'll discuss the details after that. But keep it

40
00:04:34,337 --> 00:04:36,631
coming. Yeah!

41
00:04:36,631 --> 00:04:45,488
MATT: That's Ulfgar. All righty. On the other
table we have three-- well, characters in a bit.

42
00:04:45,488 --> 00:04:48,295
We'll get to the introductions when they become
part of the story, but for now we have three of

43
00:04:48,295 --> 00:04:53,287
our talented members of Vox Machina, and the
regular Critical Role crew will be jumping into

44
00:04:53,287 --> 00:04:57,129
some new characters tonight that will be unveiled
later. Go ahead and introduce yourselves real fast.

45
00:04:57,129 --> 00:04:58,590
MARISHA: Our characters or ourselves?

46
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,770
MATT: No, just yourselves.

47
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:05,622
MARISHA: Oh, hello, I'm Marisha Ray, and you can
catch us on Critical Role on Thursday nights, and

48
00:05:05,622 --> 00:05:10,938
I'm a voice actor, and actor, and host, and all
that stuff, and today I'm playing D&amp;D.

49
00:05:10,938 --> 00:05:12,561
MATT: Rocking.

50
00:05:12,561 --> 00:05:16,534
LIAM: Hi, I'm Liam O'Brien.

51
00:05:16,534 --> 00:05:24,167
ORION: Hi, Liam O'Brien is an amazing voice actor.
He's done a lot of amazing things in a lot of

52
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:25,241
amazing projects.

53
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,524
LIAM: Aww.

54
00:05:26,524 --> 00:05:33,312
ORION: I'm DBM and your mind will be blown. I'm
Orion Acaba, who is far less impressive, but also

55
00:05:33,312 --> 00:05:40,646
awesome. I'm a voice actor, also on Critical Role,
who-- I was in Final Fantasy, okay?

56
00:05:40,646 --> 00:05:49,326
MATT: Thank you. Awesome. Great introductions, all
right. I do want to talk about the donation aspect

57
00:05:49,326 --> 00:05:51,955
of tonight's game, or has that already been
established?

58
00:05:51,955 --> 00:06:03,055
ZAC: The chat--The Shathrum is informing itself?
Yes. They are aware if they look in the Shathrum

59
00:06:03,055 --> 00:06:09,067
for the "moderators" of the spoken word of thy
lord. I don't even know how to spin this. If you

60
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:15,659
donate 500 dollars, a message may appear that
could affect the outcome of the game.

61
00:06:15,659 --> 00:06:20,085
IFY: Ayo, I just got that play on words. That's a
real good play on words now that I figured it out.

62
00:06:20,085 --> 00:06:22,153
In my head. I'm on board.

63
00:06:22,153 --> 00:06:26,730
DAN: Classic moderators. Clerics. This fucking
guy.

64
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:33,853
MATT: And on that note, let's go ahead and jump in
and begin tonight's game. So... Salty Pete.

65
00:06:33,853 --> 00:06:39,979
Actually, the Snugglelord I believe has a custom
miniature. Is that in the studio at the moment?

66
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:46,061
ZAC: Oh, the miniature? Oh my god, I forgot it.
You know, I was here a little late last night and

67
00:06:46,061 --> 00:06:50,492
didn't bring it like an idiot. I'm never going to
hear the end of it now.

68
00:06:50,492 --> 00:06:52,482
MATT: That's okay. We'll use this for you in the
meantime, but--

69
00:06:52,482 --> 00:06:53,669
ZAC: Okay, thank you.

70
00:06:53,669 --> 00:07:02,453
DAN: But if we get to 70,000 he will leave the
studio. He will go home, get it, come back.

71
00:07:02,453 --> 00:07:12,539
MATT: That's okay. You'll only hear about it on
Twitter. So. To begin. Salty Pete, Snugglelord,

72
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:17,989
and Ulfgar, having done some dubious, yet
strangely publically lauded deeds in the recent

73
00:07:17,989 --> 00:07:23,769
months, enjoyed a small period of fleeting coin
surplus where they drank and gambled away most of

74
00:07:23,769 --> 00:07:30,532
their hard-earned bounties. This period of hard
luck, almost seemingly brought on by the mildly

75
00:07:30,532 --> 00:07:36,486
antagonistic scoundrel Shendo McCree, has you
nearing doing far dirtier work than you were used

76
00:07:36,486 --> 00:07:39,518
to, which, that'd be quite dirty based on your
past history.

77
00:07:39,518 --> 00:07:44,424
ZAC: I seem to have forgotten what some of those
things were. Could you elaborate a little bit? How

78
00:07:44,424 --> 00:07:45,932
dirty are we talking here?

79
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:49,635
MATT: Well, things you've done in the past
involved, from what the public knows, saving a

80
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:56,570
small village from a poisonous arcane sand golem
and some artefact beneath. On the outside and not

81
00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:02,208
known so well, you burned half the village down,
you nearly threatened to kill the few survivors

82
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:07,464
that were there, and took what little bit of gold
remained in the pockets of those completely

83
00:08:07,464 --> 00:08:08,816
distraught villagers.

84
00:08:08,816 --> 00:08:11,567
DAN: But we did save that woman from the house.

85
00:08:11,567 --> 00:08:21,762
MATT: You did. You did. You're right, I take it
back. However. Currently ailing from the immediate

86
00:08:21,762 --> 00:08:28,088
lack of funds, you sit about the raucous,
alcohol-misted tavern known as Verian's Beer Den,

87
00:08:28,088 --> 00:08:34,313
drinking what remains from the inside of your coin
purses, and currently discussing amongst

88
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:37,650
yourselves how the hell to pull yourselves out of
this looming debt.

89
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:41,922
DAN: How are we going to pull ourselves out of
this looming debt?

90
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:43,732
(laughter)

91
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,344
DAN: It's just looming!

92
00:08:45,344 --> 00:08:52,556
ZAC: Well, if you had done what I had asked you to
do, which is to communicate with these peasants

93
00:08:52,556 --> 00:08:56,248
and possibly find us some good bounty work, or at
least something--

94
00:08:56,248 --> 00:09:01,018
DAN: No one wants to talk to a man with seven
fingers. No one!

95
00:09:01,018 --> 00:09:06,843
ZAC: Valid point. How about-- Will you tape on
another finger, maybe, perchance?

96
00:09:06,843 --> 00:09:09,458
DAN: Ah, yeah, that's not suspicious at all.

97
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:13,239
IFY: I mean, if you want this finger I'm still
wearing around my neck, I mean, you can have it

98
00:09:13,239 --> 00:09:14,396
back, but...

99
00:09:14,396 --> 00:09:16,318
DAN: No. It looks good. It completes the outfit.

100
00:09:16,318 --> 00:09:17,523
IFY: Thank you.

101
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:21,867
MATT: All right. If I could have you guys all roll
a perception check real fast. Go ahead and roll a

102
00:09:21,867 --> 00:09:24,467
d20, add your perception skill to the d20 roll.

103
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:27,653
DAN: Nine.

104
00:09:27,653 --> 00:09:32,010
IFY: 21.

105
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:35,925
DAN: Very perceptive!

106
00:09:35,925 --> 00:09:38,004
MATT: Snugglelord.

107
00:09:38,004 --> 00:09:41,323
DAN: Perception is right here. That is three.

108
00:09:41,323 --> 00:09:42,323
ZAC: 19.

109
00:09:42,323 --> 00:09:47,707
MATT: 19. Okay. While Salty Pete is currently
staring at the lowly stumps of what used to be his

110
00:09:47,707 --> 00:09:54,783
digits on one hand, the two of you notice on the
far side of the bar, a young girl, maybe 16 or so,

111
00:09:54,783 --> 00:09:59,303
rushes into the tavern from the back with a hooded
cloak covering most of her features. She runs over

112
00:09:59,303 --> 00:10:03,731
to the tavern owner behind the bar, a rather
robust-looking gentleman in his mid-30s, big

113
00:10:03,731 --> 00:10:09,012
square chin, Gaston in appearance, and a bit of
swagger to how he runs this establishment. This

114
00:10:09,012 --> 00:10:15,106
being the Verian character. She runs up to him and
hands him a piece of parchment, talking to him for

115
00:10:15,106 --> 00:10:19,108
a bit. You can't make out the actual speech, and
they're too far to make out what the lips are

116
00:10:19,108 --> 00:10:23,800
saying, but she hands him the parchment and they
speak for a bit. Verian then reaches down and

117
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:30,813
hands her a little bit of gold. Ulfgar, you
recognize the amount of gold passed over, as you

118
00:10:30,813 --> 00:10:33,388
are very tuned in to the presence of gold.

119
00:10:33,388 --> 00:10:35,460
(laughter)

120
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:42,090
MATT: Five gold pieces have been passed on to this
young girl. She immediately nods, pulls her hood

121
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:44,973
up even closer, and darts back out the door she
entered from.

122
00:10:44,973 --> 00:10:48,042
MARISHA: She was just getting a dime bag. It's
fine.

123
00:10:48,042 --> 00:10:52,879
ZAC: Were you checking out an underage woman, or
was something else going on in that situation?

124
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:57,037
IFY: No, silly, I was checking out that gold over
there, man. I don't care about women. Just gold.

125
00:10:57,037 --> 00:10:59,884
ZAC: What gold are you speaking of?

126
00:10:59,884 --> 00:11:04,959
IFY: There's some gold in that pouch that she gave
to him. Now, I'm about to go over there and I'm

127
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,983
going to seduce him.

128
00:11:06,983 --> 00:11:11,544
ZAC: Carry on. Go for it.

129
00:11:11,544 --> 00:11:20,236
IFY: Hey there. I feel like two beefy dudes like
me and you can really share some gold and some

130
00:11:20,236 --> 00:11:23,122
good times together. What do you think?

131
00:11:23,122 --> 00:11:27,001
MATT: As you approach Verian at the bar and say
this to him, Verian looks at you with a quizzical

132
00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:33,011
expression and goes, "Well... I don't mean to tell
you one way or the other, but I am first off very

133
00:11:33,011 --> 00:11:39,484
"confused, but mildly blushing at this offer you've
given me. But, strangely enough, you walk with

134
00:11:39,484 --> 00:11:42,081
"those two at the table you were just at, I assume,
yes?"

135
00:11:42,081 --> 00:11:43,442
IFY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

136
00:11:43,442 --> 00:11:49,955
MATT: "All right, well, Snuggleface as well. Come
this way. It appears I have a notice for the three

137
00:11:49,955 --> 00:11:52,215
"of you, and I would like to share this
information."

138
00:11:52,215 --> 00:11:54,192
ZAC: Wait, wait, wait, hold up. On us?

139
00:11:54,192 --> 00:11:56,379
MATT: "Yes. It's requested right here."

140
00:11:56,379 --> 00:12:00,099
ZAC: Is it... notice or wanted papers?

141
00:12:00,099 --> 00:12:06,057
MATT: "Well. That is information that comes with a
price in this place. Understood, information is

142
00:12:06,057 --> 00:12:13,646
"expensive, and I paid quite a sum to be the
messenger. It's the way the work is done, my friend."

143
00:12:13,646 --> 00:12:19,552
IFY: Yeah, I see, I see. But you also look so
stressed. Maybe I can massage you up, you know.

144
00:12:19,552 --> 00:12:25,825
These fighter hands are mighty strong, and I could
really get those kinks out.

145
00:12:25,825 --> 00:12:27,882
MATT: Go ahead and make a persuasion roll.

146
00:12:27,882 --> 00:12:32,668
(laughter)

147
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,467
LIAM: Give that man advantage.

148
00:12:34,467 --> 00:12:36,194
(laughter)

149
00:12:36,194 --> 00:12:37,707
IFY: 13.

150
00:12:37,707 --> 00:12:38,980
DAN: Minus one?

151
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:44,351
(laughter)

152
00:12:44,351 --> 00:12:50,063
MATT: He goes, "A tempting offer, based on the
knots that have been acquired over many years of

153
00:12:50,063 --> 00:12:56,060
"hard labor behind this bar, but I think, as you
would respect, money talks..."

154
00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:03,580
IFY: Bullshit walks. I like this guy. This guy is
like me! He knows what I'm talking about. Yeah.

155
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:12,126
ZAC: Listen, how about you just tell me what's on
the fucking sheet you have right there. Right now.

156
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:14,485
DAN: Ah, straight shooter.

157
00:13:14,485 --> 00:13:21,375
MATT: "For what? I fail to see, despite your
somewhat demonic appearance, the soft, cuddly

158
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:28,258
"exterior of the clothing you wear, I have not
this-- you stare at me with such darkness. I am

159
00:13:28,258 --> 00:13:30,307
"confused by this."

160
00:13:30,307 --> 00:13:37,318
ZAC: These two here, these two assholes that I
employ, are at my bidding. They may be stupid but

161
00:13:37,318 --> 00:13:39,165
they punch hard.

162
00:13:39,165 --> 00:13:44,359
IFY: Actually, at the current time, he has way
more money than you, and I'm liable to fight for

163
00:13:44,359 --> 00:13:46,455
his sake and his body.

164
00:13:46,455 --> 00:13:48,756
DAN: Listen. For the sake of hypothetical.

165
00:13:48,756 --> 00:13:52,416
ZAC: Next time we're going to-- Can we step away
from the man I'm trying to intimidate, and we

166
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,952
discuss this as a group?

167
00:13:53,952 --> 00:13:58,891
DAN: Well, maybe you can loop us in next time
instead of being like oh, they're so stupid. They

168
00:13:58,891 --> 00:14:00,591
don't get it. They've got feelings.

169
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:03,978
IFY: I know, seriously! I'm over here having a
good flirt session. You guys, coming up here--

170
00:14:03,978 --> 00:14:06,111
ZAC: That was going nowhere!

171
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:11,271
MATT: Snugglelord. Make an intimidation check with
disadvantage.

172
00:14:11,271 --> 00:14:14,212
(laughter)

173
00:14:14,212 --> 00:14:15,927
ZAC: With <i>dis</i>advantage?

174
00:14:15,927 --> 00:14:17,752
MATT: Yes. Roll twice and take the lower.

175
00:14:17,752 --> 00:14:20,956
(laughter)

176
00:14:20,956 --> 00:14:22,958
IFY: Might as well just say it, it's...

177
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:26,711
DAN: It's going to go just like earlier.

178
00:14:26,711 --> 00:14:29,824
(laughter)

179
00:14:29,824 --> 00:14:35,936
MATT: Verian crosses his arms, clutching the
parchment in his hand, and goes, "Hah. That was

180
00:14:35,936 --> 00:14:39,453
"adorable. But no, seriously. 15 gold."

181
00:14:39,453 --> 00:14:42,131
IFY: God! That's a lot of money, man.

182
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:49,397
MATT: "So is the promises this parchment provides.
It looks very informative. Eh?"

183
00:14:49,397 --> 00:14:57,160
DAN: Can I try to use sleight of hand to replace
it with a piece of paper in my bag?

184
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,508
(laughter)

185
00:14:59,508 --> 00:15:05,762
DAN: Close up magic!

186
00:15:05,762 --> 00:15:10,320
MATT: Go for it? With disadvantage. It's going to be
a hard one.

187
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,474
ORION: Do it. Double 20's.

188
00:15:12,474 --> 00:15:15,653
IFY: That is a 20. That's a natural--

189
00:15:15,653 --> 00:15:18,788
DAN: Hold on, let me see if that is a 20. Oh, that
was a 20.

190
00:15:18,788 --> 00:15:21,493
MARISHA: Roll again and hope it's another 20.

191
00:15:21,493 --> 00:15:23,887
IFY: Oh!

192
00:15:23,887 --> 00:15:29,802
DAN: Hold on. 13.

193
00:15:29,802 --> 00:15:32,531
(laughter)

194
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:37,644
MATT: As your hand slides across the front of the
bar, your finger touches the edge of the

195
00:15:37,644 --> 00:15:43,975
parchment. You wink and point with your-- most
fingers in the direction. And he glances briefly,

196
00:15:43,975 --> 00:15:48,460
and as you give a slight tug you feel his meaty
hand slap onto your wrist, and slowly pull

197
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:54,524
back your hand. His glance comes back towards
yours, meeting your gaze, and goes, "It is now 20

198
00:15:54,524 --> 00:15:55,665
"gold, my friend."

199
00:15:55,665 --> 00:15:57,926
DAN: Aww, you got me there.

200
00:15:57,926 --> 00:16:05,196
IFY: I go ahead and take this opportunity to rest
my hand on his hand and say, we can work this out,

201
00:16:05,196 --> 00:16:09,380
my friend. We got something here for both of us.

202
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,759
(laughter)

203
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:13,649
CHAT ROOM: Small street urchin boy runs by and
steals paper.

204
00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:15,295
DAN: What?!

205
00:16:15,295 --> 00:16:21,119
MATT: Suddenly, the paper is snatched out from
Verian's hand, the influence of the dark deity

206
00:16:21,119 --> 00:16:26,414
somehow pushing fate along. This child that
shouldn't have even been in this tavern from the

207
00:16:26,414 --> 00:16:30,713
get-go, is just small enough to stay out of sight.
Runs off going (laughs), clutching the paper in

208
00:16:30,713 --> 00:16:32,557
his hand, out the back door.

209
00:16:32,557 --> 00:16:36,632
ZAC: Let's chase him. This is our chance. He has
to hold to the business, we can go after him.

210
00:16:36,632 --> 00:16:39,120
IFY: You guys chase him, I'll hold it down over
here.

211
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:47,435
ZAC: You are not sleeping with this man! There is 
another opportunity, later, later, let's get the child, go!

212
00:16:47,435 --> 00:16:49,996
DAN: It takes three of us to catch one orphan.

213
00:16:49,996 --> 00:16:52,650
ZAC: Well, yes, obviously in this situation.

214
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,892
(laughter)

215
00:16:54,892 --> 00:16:55,760
IFY: All right.

216
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,589
DAN: Let's go.

217
00:16:56,589 --> 00:16:57,543
IFY: Let's do it!

218
00:16:57,543 --> 00:17:01,410
MATT: All right, you guys charge out into the
night air, looking across both sides. Everyone

219
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:06,420
make a perception check real fast to see if you
can ascertain which direction the child went.

220
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,946
IFY: 18 for me.

221
00:17:08,946 --> 00:17:10,059
ZAC: Eight.

222
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:11,642
DAN: Eight.

223
00:17:11,642 --> 00:17:17,365
MATT: All right, Ulfgar, your keen eyes glance
back and forth. To the left you can see the small

224
00:17:17,365 --> 00:17:21,808
child ducking into a nearby alleyway before
disappearing into the shadows. You guys continue

225
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:26,235
following and curving in that alleyway and you
realize that child, while trying to do their best

226
00:17:26,235 --> 00:17:31,610
to escape, has somehow found themselves cornered in
the back of a dead end. The child turns real fast

227
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:43,588
(panting) breathing heavily. "I mean no harm!
Look, I need money for my mum to eat and I'll give

228
00:17:43,588 --> 00:17:47,557
"this to you for five gold, it's cheaper than what
the man was offering, aye, aye?"

229
00:17:47,557 --> 00:17:53,379
IFY: How about I give you some of my rations? You
said you want food to eat, you ain't going to buy

230
00:17:53,379 --> 00:17:54,875
new Air Jordans.

231
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,214
DAN: Whatever those are.

232
00:17:57,214 --> 00:18:08,237
ZAC: We are three-- one competent warrior and two 
bodyguards, we could easily bully this small child into giving us

233
00:18:08,237 --> 00:18:12,962
what we want. You give up some of our food? Take
the damn paper.

234
00:18:12,962 --> 00:18:17,022
IFY: Nah, this kid, you know, I'm feeling bad for
him, you know. I feel like--

235
00:18:17,022 --> 00:18:18,798
DAN: He's like a little me.

236
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:22,406
IFY: Yeah, he's like a little me right there,
trying to get that gold, that's real cute kid,

237
00:18:22,406 --> 00:18:25,873
you're on a good path, this is the path you want
to be on right now, no?

238
00:18:25,873 --> 00:18:30,834
MATT: "Thank you sir, thank you for understanding.
We were hoping that we could come to a deal on

239
00:18:30,834 --> 00:18:33,522
"this. Five gold. Please?"

240
00:18:33,522 --> 00:18:37,247
IFY: All right. Do we have five gold left?

241
00:18:37,247 --> 00:18:41,251
DAN: I have <i>one</i>. One gold!

242
00:18:41,251 --> 00:18:44,407
ZAC: We can't afford a piece of paper!

243
00:18:44,407 --> 00:18:47,237
(laughter)

244
00:18:47,237 --> 00:18:50,509
IFY: All right, how about this? We're going to
feed your momma, right? You want to feed your

245
00:18:50,509 --> 00:18:52,287
momma, I want to feed your momma too.

246
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,510
DAN: Whoa.

247
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,231
ZAC: That's a small child!

248
00:18:55,231 --> 00:18:58,004
IFY: I am not going to bully a child, that's not
the life I live--

249
00:18:58,004 --> 00:18:59,498
ZAC: But you'll fuck her mother?

250
00:18:59,498 --> 00:19:01,245
IFY: Maybe. Look!

251
00:19:01,245 --> 00:19:05,737
DAN: He said, to be fair, he said <i>feed</i>. That's
open to interpretation.

252
00:19:05,737 --> 00:19:08,457
ZAC: I knew what he meant and he did not deny.

253
00:19:08,457 --> 00:19:10,776
MATT: The child is slowly backing away further
into the alley--

254
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:17,286
IFY: Hey, hey! Slow down. How about we each give
you a day's worth of rations?

255
00:19:17,286 --> 00:19:22,905
MATT: Make a persuasion roll. I'll say with
advantage because you've been the one person nice

256
00:19:22,905 --> 00:19:24,992
to this kid since you arrived.

257
00:19:24,992 --> 00:19:27,066
(laughter)

258
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:28,930
MATT: Roll twice, take the higher.

259
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:35,853
IFY: Oh. Let's see. 13.

260
00:19:35,853 --> 00:19:45,658
MATT: 13. The kid: "Well, I'll happily take your
rations, and the one gold you've got if that's

261
00:19:45,658 --> 00:19:50,407
"okay? I mean, you've got one gold, that's an easy
enough transaction, right?"

262
00:19:50,407 --> 00:19:57,104
IFY: See now that's my kid! Hey, do you want to be
my son? You want to be my son? I think I'm going

263
00:19:57,104 --> 00:20:01,046
to make this kid my son. He's coming on this
adventure with us, guys.

264
00:20:01,046 --> 00:20:04,114
MATT: "Are you going on an adventure?"

265
00:20:04,114 --> 00:20:09,006
ZAC: Hold on.

266
00:20:09,006 --> 00:20:11,608
IFY: I've always wanted a son.

267
00:20:11,608 --> 00:20:16,855
DAN: He has, he has.

268
00:20:16,855 --> 00:20:21,869
ZAC: The chances of this child dying very quickly
are very high. We won't have to feed the mouth for

269
00:20:21,869 --> 00:20:23,206
too much longer.

270
00:20:23,206 --> 00:20:25,933
IFY: Okay, you're taking a way cynical look. I'm
going to protect this kid!

271
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:30,254
DAN: We take him along with us like a meaty,
expendable intern.

272
00:20:30,254 --> 00:20:35,212
MATT: "What does 'expendable' mean?"

273
00:20:35,212 --> 00:20:40,116
DAN: Ah, dinnae ken when you're talking about,
Junior. You're driving a hard bargain. Hold on,

274
00:20:40,116 --> 00:20:42,050
the adults are talking.

275
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:48,014
IFY: Let's take him! Salty. You know much how much
I wanted a little boy. I told you.

276
00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:50,136
DAN: Ever since you were a little boy.

277
00:20:50,136 --> 00:20:52,477
IFY: Yeah. Let me get this little boy.

278
00:20:52,477 --> 00:20:54,620
ZAC: You idiots have known each other for that
long?

279
00:20:54,620 --> 00:21:02,033
DAN: We're pen pals. He's a mountain dwarf, I'm a
hill person. You know. We communicate. Classic, classic.

280
00:21:02,033 --> 00:21:04,278
IFY: Yeah, you can come with us, kid.

281
00:21:04,278 --> 00:21:06,161
MATT: "Really?"

282
00:21:06,161 --> 00:21:09,640
ZAC: You'll only speak to this one.

283
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,267
MATT: "All right."

284
00:21:11,267 --> 00:21:13,118
DAN: Or this one.

285
00:21:13,118 --> 00:21:14,316
ZAC: Oh, for fuck's sake.

286
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:18,857
IFY: You're going to help me raise him? You're
going to help me raise my son?

287
00:21:18,857 --> 00:21:21,232
DAN: Oh, you read my mind.

288
00:21:21,232 --> 00:21:25,709
MATT: "So I won't talk to the fuzzy one, and I'll
just talk to you two. Okay. Here's your parchment.

289
00:21:25,709 --> 00:21:30,674
"Thank you. I'm so excited! I've always wanted to
be an adventurer." And he reaches to his side, and

290
00:21:30,674 --> 00:21:36,894
he pulls out this wooden sword that's moldy and
haphazardly constructed, and he swings it around. "Hah!"

291
00:21:36,894 --> 00:21:40,620
IFY: Oh, he'll make me cry 'cause it's so cute.
Oh, dang.

292
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:44,534
DAN: What's your name, little wee orphan?

293
00:21:44,534 --> 00:21:55,161
MATT: "Stephen. My name's Stephen. My brother's
named Steven, and my mom wasn't very original, but

294
00:21:55,161 --> 00:21:57,021
"at least this way we can tell each other apart."

295
00:21:57,021 --> 00:21:59,109
DAN: It's all right. A P-H is more sophisticated.

296
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,499
MATT: "Oh, thank you."

297
00:22:00,499 --> 00:22:03,715
DAN: Unless it's an F, in which case, little
continental.

298
00:22:03,715 --> 00:22:06,470
MATT: "It's a P-H, then."

299
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:08,987
DAN: All right, great. Great.

300
00:22:08,987 --> 00:22:16,536
MATT: "All right. Let's go!" You look over the
parchment that you received. The actual note.

301
00:22:16,536 --> 00:22:18,240
ZAC: I take it from him, 'cause he can't read.

302
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,354
(laughter)

303
00:22:20,354 --> 00:22:23,347
IFY: We just explained how we were pen pals.

304
00:22:23,347 --> 00:22:26,212
ZAC: I know that those were small drawings.

305
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:29,083
IFY: Oh, pish-posh.

306
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:37,254
MATT: The note says, "Seeking the ones called Vox
Moronica."

307
00:22:37,254 --> 00:22:38,702
ZAC: It's asking for us.

308
00:22:38,702 --> 00:22:40,480
DAN: Is that what we're called now?

309
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,162
ZAC: It stuck.

310
00:22:43,162 --> 00:22:45,936
(laughter)

311
00:22:45,936 --> 00:22:54,609
MATT: "I myself am known as the alchemist Kioli. I
have an issue that seems to befit your skillset."

312
00:22:54,609 --> 00:22:58,784
ZAC: It seems, if I keep reading, there might be
some sort of mention of money, so I'm going to continue.

313
00:22:58,784 --> 00:23:02,739
DAN: Please, don't stop to tell us that, just
fucking read it.

314
00:23:02,739 --> 00:23:11,097
MATT: "Come to my home, the grey brick building at
the corner of the town square. There, I shall be

315
00:23:11,097 --> 00:23:15,115
"able to present to you, perchance, a way to make a
bit of coin for yourself."

316
00:23:15,115 --> 00:23:17,118
DAN: You were right!

317
00:23:17,118 --> 00:23:20,836
ZAC: You heard that? I was reading in my head.

318
00:23:20,836 --> 00:23:25,127
DAN: What? Oh, man! Our cycles must be lined up.

319
00:23:25,127 --> 00:23:29,998
ZAC: Basically, we need to go to this building,
and there's a possible job for us.

320
00:23:29,998 --> 00:23:36,059
IFY: Oh, I like that, job means money. Stephen. Rule number
one: always do something if it's for money. No

321
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:37,488
matter what.

322
00:23:37,488 --> 00:23:38,837
DAN: Always.

323
00:23:38,837 --> 00:23:45,126
MATT: "Okay, for the money, then." As you guys
continue towards the center of the town square,

324
00:23:45,126 --> 00:23:49,562
you eventually take a look about, and you find the
grey brick building on the corner indeed. The

325
00:23:49,562 --> 00:23:54,818
windows themselves, a dim light from the inside,
the door is closed. It looks to be a small,

326
00:23:54,818 --> 00:24:02,820
relatively unadorned or simple building, more for
function than visual presentation. As you walk up

327
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:06,085
to the edge of the door, the door appears to be
closed and locked.

328
00:24:06,085 --> 00:24:09,309
ZAC: It's locked.

329
00:24:09,309 --> 00:24:19,269
DAN: Ah, that's where I come in. I've got what's
left of my masterwork thieves' tools. I'd like to

330
00:24:19,269 --> 00:24:20,910
unlock the door.

331
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:22,120
MATT: Okay.

332
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,529
IFY: Don't worry. If it doesn't work, we can
always burn it down.

333
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:29,580
MATT: Roll, add your dexterity bonus and your
proficiency modifier.

334
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:41,381
DAN: Come on, three fingers. All right, dexterity
is plus three, 18, plus modifier. What is this again?

335
00:24:41,381 --> 00:24:44,256
MATT: Plus two should be your proficiency
modifier.

336
00:24:44,256 --> 00:24:45,835
DAN: There we go. 20.

337
00:24:45,835 --> 00:24:52,233
MATT: With but a swift move of your wrist, the
door slowly creaks open, and you can see the low,

338
00:24:52,233 --> 00:24:57,484
reddish-orange light from the interior of the room
becomes visible. Immediately, as you push the door

339
00:24:57,484 --> 00:25:03,914
open and glance inside, it is cluttered, wall to
wall small wooden crates and some broken glass

340
00:25:03,914 --> 00:25:12,658
jars that contain dried weeds and other types of
plant matter. As you peek around the corner, you

341
00:25:12,658 --> 00:25:17,192
can see there are a number of shelves and tables
set up before you that have strange, long glass

342
00:25:17,192 --> 00:25:24,047
contraptions with small brass wires that wind up
along tubes, liquids bubble and churn in all sorts

343
00:25:24,047 --> 00:25:30,495
of different colors and textures. The smell that
hits you is this very aggressively iron-like

344
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:35,210
viscous scent that causes your sinuses to
immediately expand with this burning sensation.

345
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:43,048
Across the room, you see hunched over a small iron
table, with big, thick leather gloves on, a

346
00:25:43,048 --> 00:25:48,544
humanoid figure that is currently crouched in the
middle of a very, very intense-- some sort of a

347
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:51,279
situation such as working or tinkering.

348
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,671
DAN: It looks like a hoarder.

349
00:25:53,671 --> 00:26:00,293
ZAC: This could be a dicey situation. I think this
might be a good opportunity to maybe get your new

350
00:26:00,293 --> 00:26:06,664
son some experience. Possibly go and greet this
fine creature.

351
00:26:06,664 --> 00:26:14,361
IFY: I'm not going to send my new son to go-- I'm
not sending my new son down the hall. He's not

352
00:26:14,361 --> 00:26:20,887
going down there! Now, Stephen, stay with Uncle
Pete. I'm going to go down there.

353
00:26:20,887 --> 00:26:22,847
ZAC: Fair enough. That's fine.

354
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:24,974
MATT: "I'll stay with my Uncle Pete. Hi, Uncle
Pete."

355
00:26:24,974 --> 00:26:26,443
DAN: Hello, Stephen.

356
00:26:26,443 --> 00:26:29,094
MARISHA: Oh, god.

357
00:26:29,094 --> 00:26:32,487
IFY: I'll go investigate that hole.

358
00:26:32,487 --> 00:26:37,251
MATT: Okay. As you open the door and step into the
room, you get a better view of the interior. I'm

359
00:26:37,251 --> 00:26:39,671
going to have you go ahead and roll a stealth
check.

360
00:26:39,671 --> 00:26:41,793
DAN: Oh, I'm the one who's good at stealth.

361
00:26:41,793 --> 00:26:44,481
(laughter)

362
00:26:44,481 --> 00:26:45,670
IFY: Three.

363
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:46,984
DAN: Whoops.

364
00:26:46,984 --> 00:26:52,861
MATT: As you step in and look around the rest of
the door, you see there's actually three other

365
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:59,200
individuals inside this room on the other side of
the wall, all patiently sitting arm-to-arm. As you

366
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,929
step in, you get about two or three steps before
your elbow bumps one of the nearby tables. As it

367
00:27:04,929 --> 00:27:10,127
hits it, a glass jar that's been on the edge
topples and falls, shattering on the ground.

368
00:27:10,127 --> 00:27:14,504
Instinctively, the gentleman who's hunched over at
the other table goes, "Who's there?!" and throws

369
00:27:14,504 --> 00:27:16,749
something in the air. I need you to make a
dexterity saving throw.

370
00:27:16,749 --> 00:27:18,368
(laughter)

371
00:27:18,368 --> 00:27:20,004
DAN: This is not going well.

372
00:27:20,004 --> 00:27:22,850
IFY: Seven.

373
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:25,978
(laughter)

374
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:32,412
MATT: You take four points of acid damage as
suddenly this vial that's spinning in the air

375
00:27:32,412 --> 00:27:36,853
shatters on the ground before you, filling your
space with this horribly caustic liquid. It fills

376
00:27:36,853 --> 00:27:41,703
your lungs and pocks the outside of your skin, and
you're coughing, it burns the inside. He goes,

377
00:27:41,703 --> 00:27:45,080
"Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you spooked me. Wait,
what are you doing here?"

378
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:49,609
IFY: You just throw acid at anybody who walks in your
house? Come on, man.

379
00:27:49,609 --> 00:27:52,508
MATT: "That door was locked for a reason!
Intruder! Intruder!"

380
00:27:52,508 --> 00:28:04,819
DAN: This isn't our hotel room? Oh. My goodness.
What? What's going on with you? Get out of our room.

381
00:28:04,819 --> 00:28:09,115
ZAC: See, Stephanie, this is why you send the dumb
ones in first.

382
00:28:09,115 --> 00:28:11,197
MATT: "Um, Steph--"

383
00:28:11,197 --> 00:28:17,844
DAN: He's not supposed to talk to you. You're
sending him mixed signals.

384
00:28:17,844 --> 00:28:22,080
IFY: Don't listen to this crazy dude.

385
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:32,424
MATT: At which point, "Wait, are you Vox Moronica?
I recognize you, the snuggle one. Yes, I called

386
00:28:32,424 --> 00:28:35,355
"you here. I'm sorry about the vial thing--"

387
00:28:35,355 --> 00:28:36,770
ZAC: Yes, we got your note.

388
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:41,443
MATT: "Good, step inside, step inside. Oh.
Interesting. Usually when I call in the aid of

389
00:28:41,443 --> 00:28:47,433
"various mercenary groups, it takes them a long
time to inquire. I appear to have two that have

390
00:28:47,433 --> 00:28:51,851
"arrived at the same time. Conundrum." At which
point looks over to the group of the other three,

391
00:28:51,851 --> 00:28:54,902
who are currently waiting on the side of the room,
if you guys would like to describe yourselves.

392
00:28:54,902 --> 00:28:57,018
ZAC: Hello.

393
00:28:57,018 --> 00:28:58,758
DAN: Describe yourselves!

394
00:28:58,758 --> 00:29:02,980
(laughter)

395
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:13,172
ORION: My name's Quaalude Methaqualone. Pleased to
meet you. Wood elf, druid. Do things.

396
00:29:13,172 --> 00:29:19,748
DAN: Quaalude Methaqualone? Wood elf, druid. You
do things.

397
00:29:19,748 --> 00:29:29,325
ORION: Nice to meet you. Hi, this is my
associate.

398
00:29:29,325 --> 00:29:39,428
LIAM: My name is Kurt. I come from the northern
hills. Barbarian folk. I don't wear much. I don't

399
00:29:39,428 --> 00:29:42,792
have much patience. Don't test it.

400
00:29:42,792 --> 00:29:47,926
IFY: Yeah, I see it. I'm liking what I'm seeing
right there. Liking that outfit, baby, yeah.

401
00:29:47,926 --> 00:29:49,837
DAN: Really working.

402
00:29:49,837 --> 00:29:52,239
LIAM: I can go that way.

403
00:29:52,239 --> 00:29:55,683
ORION: Open mind. Free open mind. Free open mind,
all of us.

404
00:29:55,683 --> 00:29:57,422
MATT: What's your name again, Liam?

405
00:29:57,422 --> 00:29:58,539
LIAM: Kurt.

406
00:29:58,539 --> 00:30:00,074
MATT: Kurt, all right.

407
00:30:00,074 --> 00:30:09,910
MARISHA: Hello! I'm Edna, and I'm 79 years young!
Can you believe it? (laughs) I know, that one gets

408
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,666
them every time.

409
00:30:11,666 --> 00:30:16,688
CHAT ROOM: Josephine, leader of the Guild of
Moderators, steps out of the shadows and stares

410
00:30:16,909 --> 00:30:22,018
unblinking at the party. She holds out an
enchanted red stapler and says, "It is dangerous

411
00:30:22,018 --> 00:30:24,308
"to go alone. Take this."

412
00:30:24,308 --> 00:30:26,107
LIAM: The fuck are you?!

413
00:30:26,107 --> 00:30:29,442
(yelling)

414
00:30:29,442 --> 00:30:31,683
IFY: Hey, come on, that's creepy!

415
00:30:31,683 --> 00:30:35,734
ZAC: I somehow feel like all of these things are
being driven by some unseen force. This is the

416
00:30:35,734 --> 00:30:38,786
proof I was telling you about! The Shathrum
exists!

417
00:30:38,786 --> 00:30:42,921
DAN: I remain thoroughly agnostic. All I see is a
stapler.

418
00:30:42,921 --> 00:30:44,521
ZAC: Of all the things that have happened--

419
00:30:44,521 --> 00:30:47,239
DAN: I'd love to take this creation, this--

420
00:30:47,239 --> 00:30:49,932
IFY: Wait, so you're not going to throw acid at
her?! She came out of nowhere, you don't throw

421
00:30:49,932 --> 00:30:51,918
acid at her? I'm the only one?!

422
00:30:51,918 --> 00:30:53,678
DAN: Presumably she was already in here.

423
00:30:53,678 --> 00:30:55,676
ZAC: Let's calm down and figure-- let's--

424
00:30:55,676 --> 00:31:00,350
MATT: At this point the poof of cloud smoke slowly
disappears as the guild leader has extended the

425
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:05,527
stapler, looks over towards the alchemist who
invited you and goes, "Oh! That's Josephine. I've

426
00:31:05,527 --> 00:31:08,990
known her for quite some time. Don't worry, she--
that's how she gets in and out of the room, it's a

427
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:14,883
bit spooky. A stapler, that's curious. Have you
tinkered this item yourself?" And she extends it

428
00:31:14,883 --> 00:31:19,054
and goes, "No, I just know that whatever you were
requiring in these groups was a bit dangerous and

429
00:31:19,054 --> 00:31:22,322
I figure they should take this."

430
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,521
ZAC: I will take the-- thank you.

431
00:31:24,521 --> 00:31:25,801
MATT: Fair enough.

432
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:29,014
ORION: (mumbling) There's something about you...
(unintelligible).

433
00:31:29,014 --> 00:31:30,511
MATT: "That's not a language."

434
00:31:30,511 --> 00:31:32,532
DAN: He's speaking in <i>italics</i>.

435
00:31:32,532 --> 00:31:36,300
ORION: I think it's... I think it's... I love what
you're wearing, is what I'm saying. Eh?

436
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,086
LIAM: Nobody can understand what you're saying.

437
00:31:38,086 --> 00:31:40,001
ORION: (mumbles)

438
00:31:40,001 --> 00:31:42,000
ZAC: Is your party member high?

439
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,445
MATT: "Oh no, he's just Johnny Depp as a pirate."

440
00:31:44,445 --> 00:31:46,277
(laughter)

441
00:31:46,277 --> 00:31:47,630
DAN: Oh, burn.

442
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:50,045
MATT: She bamfs out, puff of black smoke--

443
00:31:50,045 --> 00:31:53,147
IFY: Well, I guess it's time to introduce myself.

444
00:31:53,466 --> 00:31:59,196
MARISHA: What does that stapler <i>do</i>? You know, I
might be able to Detect Magic on it, you know, I

445
00:31:59,196 --> 00:32:05,229
have been doing a little bit of studying. Who says
an old dog can't learn new tricks, am I right? Let

446
00:32:05,229 --> 00:32:06,170
me see.

447
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:07,652
DAN: I can't.

448
00:32:07,652 --> 00:32:10,949
MARISHA: What? I can't? What? I'm sorry, I'm a
little hard of hearing. What?

449
00:32:10,949 --> 00:32:12,336
ORION: He cat.

450
00:32:12,336 --> 00:32:17,373
MARISHA: What? Cat? You're a kitty cat? Oh.

451
00:32:17,373 --> 00:32:19,858
DAN: Lovely to meet you.

452
00:32:19,858 --> 00:32:21,746
MARISHA: Oh, what was your name, Sonny?

453
00:32:21,746 --> 00:32:29,270
DAN: Salty Pete. <i>Salty</i>. <i>Pete</i>. AKA Sam AKA
Money Sam.

454
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:31,429
IFY: Money Sam baby, how you doing baby?

455
00:32:31,429 --> 00:32:34,486
ZAC: When did this new alias come about?

456
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:40,024
DAN: Approximately 15 to 20 minutes into last
adventure.

457
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:43,150
(laughter)

458
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:45,004
ZAC: Oh, last week, I remember.

459
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:48,563
DAN: Last time we had a big adventure.

460
00:32:48,563 --> 00:32:55,259
IFY: I'm Ulfgar Fireforge, sellsword, ex-pit
fighter, money talks, bullshit walks, this is my

461
00:32:55,259 --> 00:33:02,547
son Steph, Steph Fireforge, ex-street urchin, dope
warrior baby, 'kay? That's my warrior baby, he

462
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:04,327
does warrior baby stuff--

463
00:33:04,327 --> 00:33:07,117
MATT: "Hi, I'm his warrior baby."

464
00:33:07,117 --> 00:33:09,816
ORION: That's-- you're a lively bunch.

465
00:33:09,816 --> 00:33:13,190
MARISHA: You know, he's a bit young. Don't you
think he's a bit-- he's a very young boy.

466
00:33:13,528 --> 00:33:19,938
ZAC: As the leader of this terrifying group of
mercenaries, and I believe that you can possibly

467
00:33:19,938 --> 00:33:26,345
tell if there's magic on this from here. I think
I'll hold onto it.

468
00:33:26,345 --> 00:33:29,892
MARISHA: I may not-- I'm a bit hard of seeing but
I--

469
00:33:29,892 --> 00:33:32,648
LIAM: Jesus, you fuckers talk a lot.

470
00:33:32,648 --> 00:33:35,356
MATT: "Well, anyway, I've called you here for a
reason but--"

471
00:33:35,356 --> 00:33:38,446
MARISHA: Who are you? The chat room?

472
00:33:38,446 --> 00:33:40,246
ORION: What the hell's that?

473
00:33:40,246 --> 00:33:43,132
(yelling)

474
00:33:43,132 --> 00:33:47,907
ZAC: Stop! Stop! Stop! You know of the Shathrum?

475
00:33:47,907 --> 00:33:51,176
MARISHA: I'm sorry, once again, hard of hearing,
Sonny Boy--

476
00:33:51,176 --> 00:33:54,130
DAN: This is awfully convenient.

477
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:56,557
MARISHA: The chateau? Yes, I've been to the
chateau--

478
00:33:56,557 --> 00:33:59,584
LIAM: He's asking you where the shitter is.

479
00:33:59,584 --> 00:34:03,136
MARISHA: The shitter? The shitter is right around
the corner.

480
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:07,626
ZAC: No the Shat-- the Shathrum! The Shathrum
speaks to me, does it speak to you, too?

481
00:34:07,626 --> 00:34:10,698
MARISHA: Oh, you know that voice-- are you
referring to that voice?

482
00:34:10,698 --> 00:34:12,171
ZAC: Yes! Yes! The voice.

483
00:34:12,171 --> 00:34:17,451
MARISHA: I heard that too. Did you hear that? Is
that what we're talking about now, I don't know--

484
00:34:17,451 --> 00:34:23,100
MATT: "I'm certainly afraid no one's heard no
Shathrum. That's a dark god we don't speak of.

485
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:30,072
Dark days in the past. It rendered whole
communities forfeit of their lives. I really hope

486
00:34:30,072 --> 00:34:34,274
that you're not saying that's what you're looking
for."

487
00:34:34,274 --> 00:34:38,478
DAN: No, definitely not.

488
00:34:38,478 --> 00:34:43,129
ZAC: Definitely, I would definitely not follow
every word and commandment of the Shath-- no.

489
00:34:43,129 --> 00:34:45,804
MATT: "All right, well, down to business then."

490
00:34:45,804 --> 00:34:50,033
MARISHA: Okay. Oh wait, let me-- can I Detect
Magic on that stapler?

491
00:34:50,033 --> 00:34:52,044
MATT: Do you have an Identify or a Detect Magic
spell?

492
00:34:52,044 --> 00:34:54,432
MARISHA: I do have Detect Magic.

493
00:34:54,432 --> 00:34:57,832
MATT: Okay. You take a moment and it is indeed
emanating a magical force on it.

494
00:34:57,832 --> 00:35:00,966
MARISHA: Can I tell what kind of magical force?

495
00:35:00,966 --> 00:35:08,670
MATT: You gather it has some semblance of an
abjuration-based spell enchantment. You'd have to

496
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,582
actually take some time with it to ascertain its
nature.

497
00:35:10,582 --> 00:35:14,427
MARISHA: You know, I have to take a little bit
more time with it, but I feel like it might have

498
00:35:14,427 --> 00:35:17,179
some sort of protective qualities to it.

499
00:35:17,179 --> 00:35:21,875
MATT: "Anyway! You've all stumbled loudly into my
home."

500
00:35:21,875 --> 00:35:25,677
IFY: Yeah, but I also got acid thrown in my face.
Don't forget that.

501
00:35:25,677 --> 00:35:27,054
MATT: "You snuck up on me!"

502
00:35:27,054 --> 00:35:28,501
IFY: I'm never going to let you forget that.

503
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:29,998
ORION: We've been here quietly.

504
00:35:29,998 --> 00:35:34,338
MATT: "I know, and that's fine. I have two
mercenary parties that are now vying for the same

505
00:35:34,338 --> 00:35:35,225
job."

506
00:35:35,225 --> 00:35:39,560
DAN: Shotgun. Blitz. No blitz.

507
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:44,002
ZAC: We don't even know what this is! What-- We
don't agree to a job before knowing what the

508
00:35:44,002 --> 00:35:44,775
job--

509
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:46,680
DAN: Fine. Please disregard.

510
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:50,581
IFY: I agree to money, and it smells like there's
some money in here. And it smells like there's

511
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:55,591
some acid in my face because you poured acid in my
face!

512
00:35:55,591 --> 00:36:00,333
MATT: "Perhaps it'll be worth it when you hear
what the business is about, all right? Now. It

513
00:36:00,333 --> 00:36:06,475
appears I've lost my assistant. I would like to
find him. Checking in on his well-being is what I

514
00:36:06,475 --> 00:36:14,704
ask of you. Discover where he is, and bring him
back safely if possible. It's been-- well, we've

515
00:36:14,704 --> 00:36:20,367
been working on some sort of planar shifting
through alchemy and forgotten lore for a while,

516
00:36:20,367 --> 00:36:27,381
now, and we found a nearby arcane nexus in the
east, toward the center of the Zorla swamp.

517
00:36:27,381 --> 00:36:31,330
There's a nasty horde of goblins that live out
there, but we managed to barely sneak past them at

518
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:40,478
the time, and we set up a portal anchor at a place
underground. Now, our first attempt already proved

519
00:36:40,478 --> 00:36:46,541
successful: we managed to open a doorway to some
unknown location. I'm not stupid, I'm not going in

520
00:36:46,541 --> 00:36:51,579
there, so I sent my assistant in with a rope tied
around his side. Off he went, he stepped

521
00:36:51,579 --> 00:36:52,771
through--"

522
00:36:52,771 --> 00:36:54,998
ZAC: I like it, I like it. That's a good tactic.

523
00:36:54,998 --> 00:36:58,213
MATT: "I think so, too. Protects my well-being and
what good's an assistant if they're not

524
00:36:58,213 --> 00:36:59,210
disposable, right?"

525
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:01,082
ZAC: I completely understand.

526
00:37:01,082 --> 00:37:05,549
MATT: "So I sent him in. He stepped through.
Didn't return for about 30 minutes, nearly

527
00:37:05,549 --> 00:37:08,863
bringing all 300 feet of rope in with him."

528
00:37:08,863 --> 00:37:09,945
DAN: That's a lot of rope.

529
00:37:09,945 --> 00:37:14,459
MATT: "I know! It went taut, I pulled him back in,
and eventually he came back safe and sound. Little

530
00:37:14,459 --> 00:37:19,347
chilled, a little confused, but fine. Came back,
sneaking past the goblins, a little bit of a run

531
00:37:19,347 --> 00:37:25,765
as they discovered our passage, but we made it
back fine. That evening, he recalled a landscape

532
00:37:25,765 --> 00:37:31,637
of shifting shapes and earth, purples and darkness
and forms without form and creatures that drifted

533
00:37:31,637 --> 00:37:36,982
between the realms, all kinds of interesting
things. One swam through the air and through him,

534
00:37:36,982 --> 00:37:42,861
leaving him tickled and unscathed. But that's all
he recalls. He says he only recalls about five

535
00:37:42,861 --> 00:37:46,973
minutes of this portal, then darkness for a bit,
but he was in there for a good 30 minutes. I think

536
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:53,221
he lost some time in there. Anyway. Pulled him
back, he was fine. But he grew a little more

537
00:37:53,221 --> 00:37:58,079
distant over the next few nights, not really
answering my calls as quickly, seemed to be lost

538
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:04,618
in thought a lot, and eventually, in the morning,
he went missing. I used my divinations, as limited

539
00:38:04,618 --> 00:38:11,116
as they are, to discover that he had run off into
the swamp by himself, beelining for that doorway

540
00:38:11,116 --> 00:38:16,803
that we originally found and opened. So. I count
myself lucky on a blue moon, and I wish not to

541
00:38:16,803 --> 00:38:23,972
endanger myself by going after him myself. Thus,
I'm willing to pay 2,500 gold pieces to the group

542
00:38:23,972 --> 00:38:26,531
who finds him and brings him back."

543
00:38:26,531 --> 00:38:29,529
DAN: Like I said, shotgun.

544
00:38:29,529 --> 00:38:35,583
IFY: I'm going to need to take a seat real quick.
That's a lot of money. Oh, yeah. Tell me how much

545
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:37,681
that was again?

546
00:38:37,681 --> 00:38:40,032
MATT: "2,500 gold pieces."

547
00:38:40,032 --> 00:38:42,735
IFY: Oh, yeah.

548
00:38:42,735 --> 00:38:45,035
ZAC: I apologize. He's...

549
00:38:45,035 --> 00:38:47,818
DAN: He's an enthusiastic--

550
00:38:47,818 --> 00:38:52,318
IFY: Say that one more time for me, it's just
getting me there.

551
00:38:52,318 --> 00:38:56,199
MATT: "I'm going to not, actually. There's
children present."

552
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:58,993
DAN: He likes currency.

553
00:38:58,993 --> 00:39:06,012
LIAM: Are you asking us to work together? Or to
compete against one another?

554
00:39:06,012 --> 00:39:10,590
MATT: "To be honest, I would prefer you work
together, because I get the feeling this isn't

555
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:13,797
going to go very far if you don't."

556
00:39:13,797 --> 00:39:17,350
ZAC: I'm completely okay with this, as long as you
all understand that I am of course in lead of this

557
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:18,755
party.

558
00:39:18,994 --> 00:39:20,555
LIAM: (laughs)

559
00:39:20,555 --> 00:39:25,093
ORION: As he says that, I'm going to take a
special leaf pod that I have, and I'm going to pop

560
00:39:25,093 --> 00:39:27,268
a couple seeds.

561
00:39:27,268 --> 00:39:30,801
DAN: Was that an edamame?

562
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:32,986
(laughter)

563
00:39:32,986 --> 00:39:36,349
ORION: You want one? It's great.

564
00:39:36,349 --> 00:39:38,776
ZAC: No, no.

565
00:39:40,576 --> 00:39:43,044
DAN: Just curious.

566
00:39:43,044 --> 00:39:46,227
MARISHA: Is that Metamucil? Is that what that is?

567
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:49,777
DAN: Keeps him regular.

568
00:39:49,777 --> 00:39:52,170
MARISHA: Ah yes, I forgot to take mine today.

569
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:54,988
ORION: [jumbled] --it'll make you poop.

570
00:39:54,988 --> 00:39:56,831
MARISHA: What?

571
00:39:56,831 --> 00:40:00,100
LIAM: We're going to get your shit done for you.
Where are we going?

572
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:05,341
MATT: "East, to the Zorla swamp. Past the goblin
hordes, you'll find some sort of a mound with a

573
00:40:05,341 --> 00:40:09,863
tunnel in it. Beneath there is where we found
where the planes are weakest and where alchemy

574
00:40:09,863 --> 00:40:15,038
allowed us to open that doorway. He's probably
somewhere within there, scattered. He does not

575
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:20,557
have the means of opening the portal himself. This
I know. He's probably somewhere lost in that den.

576
00:40:20,557 --> 00:40:24,604
Don't know why. Try and bring him back safe, if
you could."

577
00:40:24,604 --> 00:40:30,649
IFY: Do we want to rest before this, maybe stop by
the Valarian Bar for a little bit--

578
00:40:31,642 --> 00:40:37,883
CHAT ROOM: Edna suddenly develops Tourette's and
can't stop saying Vilian and Dasmodel at random

579
00:40:37,883 --> 00:40:40,379
intervals.

580
00:40:40,379 --> 00:40:41,931
MARISHA: Did they say Edna?

581
00:40:41,931 --> 00:40:43,595
DAN: They surely did.

582
00:40:43,595 --> 00:40:46,226
MARISHA: Edna says what randomly now?

583
00:40:46,226 --> 00:40:47,571
DAN: She has Tourette's and says--

584
00:40:47,571 --> 00:40:50,208
MARISHA: I have Tourette's and I say what?

585
00:40:50,208 --> 00:40:52,647
MATT: Balium and Deswomwom?

586
00:40:52,647 --> 00:40:54,782
DAN: Balium and Desmond?

587
00:40:54,782 --> 00:40:56,137
MARISHA: Balium and Desmond?

588
00:40:56,137 --> 00:40:58,326
MATT: What was the phrase?

589
00:40:58,326 --> 00:41:03,090
MARISHA: If I could get a confirmation on what my
Tourette's entails.

590
00:41:10,786 --> 00:41:12,589
MATT: Belial and Asmodan.

591
00:41:13,756 --> 00:41:17,138
DAN: Ah, classic mythology.

592
00:41:17,138 --> 00:41:22,280
MARISHA: Classic voice-to-speech not knowing what
the shit nerds say.

593
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:30,251
ZAC: Did you hear that voice per se just now?

594
00:41:30,251 --> 00:41:35,098
MARISHA: You mean Asmodeus? Asmodeum?

595
00:41:35,098 --> 00:41:36,578
ZAC: Did you hear the voice?

596
00:41:36,578 --> 00:41:38,035
MARISHA: Is that what he said?

597
00:41:38,035 --> 00:41:45,429
MATT: Asmodan. Write it down. Asmodeum is what
keeps you regular.

598
00:41:45,429 --> 00:41:46,477
DAN: That's what he took.

599
00:41:46,477 --> 00:41:48,227
ORION: Here, have some Asmodeum.

600
00:41:48,227 --> 00:41:49,477
MARISHA: Oh, Asmodeum!

601
00:41:49,477 --> 00:41:53,383
ZAC: The voice? Did you hear the voice too?

602
00:41:54,523 --> 00:41:58,862
MATT: "If you're talking voices, I want this out
of my home! Get out! Do this job, come back for

603
00:41:58,862 --> 00:42:00,075
the money."

604
00:42:00,075 --> 00:42:05,480
ZAC: We'll leave. Before we go, can we at least
get something in writing. Something to say that--

605
00:42:05,926 --> 00:42:12,464
we've been screwed before, and I know that you
look like a fine individual, but-- businessman to

606
00:42:12,464 --> 00:42:14,559
businessman, please.

607
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:19,278
MATT: Pulls out a parchment and takes an extended
45 minutes to handwrite with a quill an extremely

608
00:42:19,278 --> 00:42:24,030
detailed contract, making you all wait, and then
he gets halfway through and goes, "No, no," and

609
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:26,832
crumples it up and grabs another piece of paper.

610
00:42:26,832 --> 00:42:28,429
ZAC: It's worth it.

611
00:42:28,429 --> 00:42:32,653
DAN: She said Asmodan 45 fucking times.

612
00:42:33,075 --> 00:42:35,443
MATT: "I messed up this draft, too." Crumples it
up.

613
00:42:35,443 --> 00:42:37,054
(groaning)

614
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:40,058
MATT: Eventually, goes, "And that should be
square."

615
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:42,297
ZAC: Thank you.

616
00:42:42,297 --> 00:42:44,294
MATT: "There you go. Legally binding."

617
00:42:44,294 --> 00:42:46,479
ZAC: Thank you very much. That's great.

618
00:42:46,479 --> 00:42:47,720
MATT: "No worries, get out."

619
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:51,976
LIAM: Cort stands up and says, I've had enough. I
report to Edna and no one else. Let's fucking do

620
00:42:52,237 --> 00:42:55,802
this. He kicks the door open and leaves.

621
00:42:55,802 --> 00:42:58,297
ZAC: I didn't speak anything but two words for the
last hour and a half!

622
00:42:58,297 --> 00:43:00,012
DAN: Well, that escalated quickly.

623
00:43:00,012 --> 00:43:01,290
MATT: "That door is easy to dam--"

624
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:04,070
LIAM: Go fuck yourself!

625
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:05,560
ORION: What's going on?

626
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:08,902
ZAC: Somehow I've ended up with more idiots than
when I started.

627
00:43:08,902 --> 00:43:11,739
DAN: Ah, classic escalation.

628
00:43:11,739 --> 00:43:14,066
IFY: Oh, yeah.

629
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:20,671
ZAC: You two are now my commanders, because for
some reason you're more intelligent than the

630
00:43:20,671 --> 00:43:23,144
idiots we're picking up.

631
00:43:23,144 --> 00:43:27,377
CHAT ROOM: --obsessed with following Snugglelord
around. You are welcome.

632
00:43:27,377 --> 00:43:30,251
ALL: Who?

633
00:43:30,251 --> 00:43:33,432
ZAC: Was that Steph?

634
00:43:33,432 --> 00:43:39,171
OFF-SCREEN: Crazy blackpowder merchant becomes
obsessed with following Snugglelord around.

635
00:43:40,603 --> 00:43:44,380
DAN: Sounds like you've been pimped into doing
something.

636
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:52,062
ZAC: My lord, please, messages you could give me
that help me along my way would be very much

637
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:58,705
appreciated, my lord. Anything that could help me
get rid of these idiots and continue on my

638
00:43:58,705 --> 00:44:00,439
journey.

639
00:44:00,439 --> 00:44:06,280
MATT: With a sparkle of dark innovation, you look
up and see a star in the sky twinkle, a voice

640
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:12,833
behind you goes, (Victor voice) "Hi! You're the
one who's dressed proper. Where are you off to?

641
00:44:12,833 --> 00:44:18,113
Oh, you're nice and soft. Whoa." Rubbing your
back, this crazed old man with bits of dirt and

642
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:24,109
soot all over his face. "I need a friend. I could
be your friend."

643
00:44:24,109 --> 00:44:26,385
ZAC: No touching. No touching.

644
00:44:26,385 --> 00:44:30,812
MATT: "Then why would you wear this? It's so nice
to touch."

645
00:44:30,812 --> 00:44:33,279
DAN: That's practically his skin.

646
00:44:33,279 --> 00:44:36,695
IFY: Congratulations, you've got a son.

647
00:44:36,695 --> 00:44:41,253
DAN: Oh, he's got a boy, a wee baby. Oh, so cute.

648
00:44:41,253 --> 00:44:43,281
IFY: Haha, yeah!

649
00:44:43,281 --> 00:44:44,970
ORION: What's your name?

650
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:46,846
MATT: "My name is Victor."

651
00:44:46,846 --> 00:44:49,956
ORION: Victor, welcome to the journey.

652
00:44:49,956 --> 00:44:55,337
ZAC: No, we do not accept just anyone that comes
up to us and touches us.

653
00:44:55,337 --> 00:44:58,386
DAN: We're taking a child to a swamp?

654
00:44:58,386 --> 00:45:00,581
MARISHA: Belial!

655
00:45:00,581 --> 00:45:03,306
(laughter)

656
00:45:03,306 --> 00:45:05,330
DAN: What she said! Belial!

657
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:08,809
MATT: "No, no. My name is Victor."

658
00:45:08,809 --> 00:45:12,133
MARISHA: Asmodan. No. Yes. Asmodan.

659
00:45:14,578 --> 00:45:19,268
ZAC: Why have you cursed me so? Why have you
cursed me like this?

660
00:45:19,268 --> 00:45:22,082
LIAM: Here. Take that. There, that's better.

661
00:45:22,082 --> 00:45:23,550
LIAM: She'll be fine.

662
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:26,230
ZAC: Stephanie, don't do drugs.

663
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:32,315
IFY: Stop talking to my son, okay? He's <i>my</i> son,
don't ever talk to my son. Keep your words in your

664
00:45:32,315 --> 00:45:35,187
zone and you got your own son, I've got a son--

665
00:45:35,187 --> 00:45:36,612
ZAC: I do not have a son!

666
00:45:36,612 --> 00:45:43,036
DAN: He's got an adult son.

667
00:45:43,036 --> 00:45:47,512
ORION: I think you just call it a friend. You just
call them friends.

668
00:45:47,512 --> 00:45:49,686
DAN: A ward of the state.

669
00:45:49,686 --> 00:45:54,008
MATT: As you guys, through the moonlight, start
making your way outside of the actual town towards

670
00:45:54,008 --> 00:45:56,710
the outskirts of Zorla swamp--

671
00:45:56,710 --> 00:46:02,010
ORION: I say, I know the swamp. Whenever you have
something show up and everything pops up it will

672
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:03,899
reflect it back.

673
00:46:03,899 --> 00:46:07,324
ZAC: Well, that's great. I have no idea what this
idiot is saying. Does anyone-- can anyone

674
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:08,827
translate?

675
00:46:08,827 --> 00:46:10,440
DAN: He knows it's a swamp.

676
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,378
ORION: Yes. It's the same thing every time.

677
00:46:12,378 --> 00:46:19,161
DAN: Something pops up and we reflect it back?
Like a funhouse mirror?

678
00:46:19,161 --> 00:46:20,917
ORION: Or something.

679
00:46:20,917 --> 00:46:26,739
MATT: "All right." The little boy who's following
you goes, "Okay! Don't worry, I'll protect you!"

680
00:46:26,739 --> 00:46:29,871
And he pulls out a small wooden sword and is like
(fighting noises).

681
00:46:29,871 --> 00:46:33,711
ORION: That's a good lad. That's a good lad.

682
00:46:33,711 --> 00:46:41,450
IFY: So good. Oh my god, I'm crying again because
he's so cute. Oh god. I love my son!

683
00:46:42,163 --> 00:46:45,643
MARISHA: He's so cute. Would you like a chocolate
chip cookie?

684
00:46:45,643 --> 00:46:48,886
IFY: Go there and get a cookie from grandma.
That's your grandma now.

685
00:46:48,886 --> 00:46:51,210
MATT: "A cookie? I'd love one right now, thank
you."

686
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:52,733
ZAC: Can we all shut up?!

687
00:46:52,733 --> 00:46:54,914
DAN: You had pastries this entire time?

688
00:46:54,914 --> 00:46:56,059
ZAC: Oh my god.

689
00:46:56,059 --> 00:47:02,762
MARISHA: I raised two children in my day, I always
keep a good pastry on me. Here.

690
00:47:02,762 --> 00:47:06,945
MATT: Stephan starts crying as the large, scary
devil man in the--

691
00:47:06,945 --> 00:47:10,344
IFY: Don't yell at my son. You won't tell me how
to raise my kids, I won't tell you how to raise

692
00:47:10,344 --> 00:47:12,877
your kid over there, okay?

693
00:47:12,877 --> 00:47:14,872
ZAC: It's not my child, we--

694
00:47:14,872 --> 00:47:20,498
IFY: Don't, don't-- Stephan, go over there to your
grandma and get a cookie. She your grandma now.

695
00:47:20,498 --> 00:47:22,468
(laughter)

696
00:47:22,468 --> 00:47:25,466
MATT: He dries the tears from his face and goes
"Okay."

697
00:47:25,466 --> 00:47:30,303
MARISHA: Come here little-- Belial! Stephan! Come
here. Come here-- Asmodan! Come here.

698
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:33,518
MATT: The closer he gets the slower his walk is
and the more the look of trepidation is on his

699
00:47:33,518 --> 00:47:36,772
face. You can see him struggling with the idea of
like, "I really want this cookie but she is really

700
00:47:36,772 --> 00:47:38,667
freaking me out right now."

701
00:47:38,667 --> 00:47:44,901
MARISHA: What? No. Look, I know I look old and
scary but trust me I was quite the hot little

702
00:47:44,901 --> 00:47:48,393
shimmy back in the day, Asmodan.

703
00:47:48,393 --> 00:47:52,522
MATT: "Thanks." Grabs the cookie and darts back
ten feet and starts chewing it rapidly. At which

704
00:47:52,522 --> 00:47:58,841
point, in the distance you see catching up to you
now with heavy breath-- "You all move so very

705
00:47:58,841 --> 00:48:03,745
fast, but you're not too fast for Victor."

706
00:48:03,745 --> 00:48:05,808
ZAC: Oh, you haven't died of a heart attack yet?

707
00:48:05,808 --> 00:48:09,219
DAN: A son can always find his father.

708
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:11,993
MATT: "To the swamp!" And he goes running off in
front of you.

709
00:48:11,993 --> 00:48:14,131
ZAC: Let him go.

710
00:48:14,131 --> 00:48:19,707
CHAT ROOM: Two great goliath warriors with two
large tigers attack Vox Moronica.

711
00:48:20,025 --> 00:48:22,314
IFY: God, what?!

712
00:48:22,314 --> 00:48:29,135
DAN: Are those two goliath warriors with large
tigers-- In a swamp.

713
00:48:31,067 --> 00:48:33,057
LIAM: Classic encounters.

714
00:48:35,029 --> 00:48:40,458
DAN: Wait, no, there are-- we need to reflect them
back, like he said.

715
00:48:40,458 --> 00:48:44,259
IFY: We need to reflect them?

716
00:48:45,014 --> 00:48:47,932
MATT: As you guys are having this conversation,
and we'll say going forward preferably don't

717
00:48:47,932 --> 00:48:49,899
suggest encounters, because that--

718
00:48:49,899 --> 00:48:51,770
LIAM: Yeah, no Tarrasques please.

719
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:55,775
MATT: Yeah, that's going to screw me up. However,
as you guys are having this conversation, you see

720
00:48:55,775 --> 00:49:00,623
Victor go charging off into the swamp, turn around
and go, "Never mind! Never mind! Bad idea!"

721
00:49:00,623 --> 00:49:07,794
(screaming) And from behind you see these two
dark-armored knights on top of these strange,

722
00:49:08,377 --> 00:49:13,906
slightly shifting tiger forms come charging out of
the darkness of the swamp after you.

723
00:49:13,906 --> 00:49:17,329
ORION: How far away? How far away are they?

724
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:19,172
MARISHA: I think my eyesight must be going
because--

725
00:49:19,172 --> 00:49:20,821
MATT: About 25 feet.

726
00:49:20,821 --> 00:49:25,439
MARISHA: I could swear I see two men riding giant
tigers in the distance. I really need to get some

727
00:49:25,439 --> 00:49:26,539
glasses.

728
00:49:26,539 --> 00:49:29,983
ORION: As I see this I'm like (mumbles) and I
entangle them.

729
00:49:29,983 --> 00:49:36,803
MATT: Okay. As you cast Entanglement, all these
vines go (whipping noises), forming out of the

730
00:49:36,803 --> 00:49:42,117
swamp and writhing in the air. As they reach out
towards the forms, they seem to pass through their

731
00:49:42,117 --> 00:49:43,582
physicality.

732
00:49:43,582 --> 00:49:45,461
DAN: I disbelieve.

733
00:49:45,461 --> 00:49:48,258
ORION: Well then, they're tricky, sticky ones.

734
00:49:48,258 --> 00:49:50,168
MARISHA: I'm telling you, need to get my eyes
checked.

735
00:49:50,168 --> 00:49:53,824
MATT: I need everyone to go ahead and make a
history check, if you could. All of you guys.

736
00:49:55,393 --> 00:49:56,502
DAN: 12.

737
00:49:56,502 --> 00:49:57,315
ORION: 21.

738
00:49:57,315 --> 00:49:58,593
ZAC: 18.

739
00:49:58,593 --> 00:50:01,801
LIAM: One. I'm sorry, zero. Excuse me, zero.

740
00:50:01,801 --> 00:50:03,660
ZAC: One!

741
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:04,723
ORION: 21.

742
00:50:04,723 --> 00:50:06,420
MARISHA: 19.

743
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:11,992
MATT: Okay. You understand that the Zorla Swamp,
for as long as it's existed, especially during

744
00:50:11,992 --> 00:50:17,824
nights of heavy moonlight, part of the dark
enchantment is it tends to conjure up series of

745
00:50:17,824 --> 00:50:23,199
dangerous illusions; things that have temporary
form at moments. It almost has this weird magic

746
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:30,816
where imagination can cause forms to exist for
short periods of time. They're illusions and can

747
00:50:30,816 --> 00:50:37,173
be destroyed or dispelled in certain ways, but
until then they can prove to be as deadly or

748
00:50:37,173 --> 00:50:42,436
dangerous as what you see before you. This
knowledge hits you as they approach and both of

749
00:50:42,436 --> 00:50:49,374
them ride by swinging these giant swords, one
swinging past you, Salty Pete. The second one is

750
00:50:49,374 --> 00:50:54,357
going to go for-- (laughing) is going to aim for
Victor.

751
00:50:54,357 --> 00:50:56,081
(laughter)

752
00:50:56,081 --> 00:50:57,526
DAN: Oh no.

753
00:50:57,526 --> 00:51:03,679
MATT: First, the one swinging towards you Salty
Pete, the giant sword, that is a 16 to hit. What's

754
00:51:03,679 --> 00:51:05,231
your armor class?

755
00:51:05,231 --> 00:51:07,324
DAN: That 100 percent hits. I'm 14.

756
00:51:07,324 --> 00:51:09,609
(laughter)

757
00:51:09,609 --> 00:51:12,094
DAN: Oh, just <i>casually</i> decapitated.

758
00:51:12,094 --> 00:51:16,346
MATT: You take five points of slashing damage as
the sword (whooshes). It hits you and you can see

759
00:51:16,346 --> 00:51:20,533
as it approaches to you in that instant, its form
is shimmering and doesn't seem to have physicality

760
00:51:20,533 --> 00:51:25,899
to it, yet the impact still feels like a heavy
steel blade wings you in the front of the chest.

761
00:51:25,899 --> 00:51:28,177
You feel a thick bruise beginning to form beneath
your armor.

762
00:51:28,177 --> 00:51:30,442
DAN: My sternum!

763
00:51:30,448 --> 00:51:35,605
MATT: As the tiger growls, rides past you into the
grasses behind you. The other one swings towards

764
00:51:35,605 --> 00:51:39,654
Victor who's like (old man yelling) running
away--

765
00:51:39,654 --> 00:51:45,360
ZAC: Please. Please hit him, please hit him. Lord
do me this one favor and please--

766
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:49,977
IFY: Is he close enough to throw Snugglelord to
protect his son?

767
00:51:49,977 --> 00:51:52,766
(laughter)

768
00:51:52,766 --> 00:51:55,140
MATT: Well, towards Victor, which is the old guy.
You want to--

769
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:58,224
IFY: Okay. I want to throw Snugglelord towards
Victor to protect his son.

770
00:51:58,224 --> 00:51:59,229
MATT: Okay.

771
00:51:59,229 --> 00:52:01,064
DAN: Aww, that's so sweet.

772
00:52:01,064 --> 00:52:03,292
IFY: I'm going to help you protect your son,
baby!

773
00:52:03,325 --> 00:52:04,824
ZAC: No, what are you doing?!

774
00:52:04,824 --> 00:52:07,623
MATT: I'll have you guys roll athletics checks,
contested.

775
00:52:08,576 --> 00:52:11,007
ZAC: Athletics. Where's athletics?

776
00:52:11,007 --> 00:52:12,690
IFY: 19.

777
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:14,369
ZAC: Oh god, there's no way.

778
00:52:14,369 --> 00:52:16,606
(laughter)

779
00:52:16,814 --> 00:52:21,436
MATT: This is happening. Ulfgar grabs Snugglelord,
lifts him up and throws him forward--

780
00:52:21,436 --> 00:52:23,818
ZAC: You idiot! What are you doing?!

781
00:52:23,818 --> 00:52:25,936
IFY: Protect your son! Protect your son!

782
00:52:25,936 --> 00:52:28,612
ZAC: He's not my son! He's-- aah!

783
00:52:28,612 --> 00:52:33,359
MATT: At which point, you skid to a halt, your
heels grinding into the wet earth that begins to

784
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:36,814
initiate the formation of the swamp that you guys
are traveling towards. As you finally come to a

785
00:52:36,814 --> 00:52:41,885
stop, you see Victor go, "Thanks!" and run past
you as the giant semi-illusionary warrior swings

786
00:52:41,885 --> 00:52:46,581
at you. That's a 23.

787
00:52:46,581 --> 00:52:49,421
DAN: Does that hit you?

788
00:52:49,421 --> 00:52:53,167
(laughter)

789
00:52:53,167 --> 00:52:54,815
ZAC: I believe that hits a 13.

790
00:52:54,815 --> 00:53:00,065
MATT: You take six points of slashing damage as
the blade smacks you across the abdomen. You can

791
00:53:00,065 --> 00:53:05,275
see part of your fuzzy exterior slash open and red
begin to slowly pool and darken the material.

792
00:53:05,275 --> 00:53:07,172
ZAC: Oh motherfucker.

793
00:53:07,172 --> 00:53:11,525
IFY: I look over at Stephen. "I hope to protect
you like that one day. I care about you a lot,

794
00:53:11,525 --> 00:53:12,580
son."

795
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:14,370
DAN: That's a father's love.

796
00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:18,553
ZAC: Stephanie, don't listen to your father. This
was a very dumb thing to do.

797
00:53:18,553 --> 00:53:20,527
MATT: All right, everyone roll initiative.

798
00:53:20,527 --> 00:53:22,504
LIAM: Oh Jesus.

799
00:53:26,711 --> 00:53:28,478
DAN: 20.

800
00:53:28,478 --> 00:53:29,907
MARISHA: 14.

801
00:53:29,907 --> 00:53:31,059
LIAM: 11.

802
00:53:31,059 --> 00:53:32,270
ORION: 15.

803
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:33,745
MATT: All right.

804
00:53:35,439 --> 00:53:37,478
IFY: Initiative is just your dex, right?

805
00:53:37,478 --> 00:53:38,525
MARISHA: Correct.

806
00:53:38,525 --> 00:53:40,201
IFY: All right.

807
00:53:40,201 --> 00:53:42,030
MARISHA: What are we doing? What are we fighting?

808
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:43,180
IFY: 12.

809
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:44,643
MARISHA: We're fighting these assholes?

810
00:53:44,643 --> 00:53:46,544
DAN: We're fighting the swamp.

811
00:53:46,544 --> 00:53:48,764
IFY: Can anyone dispel this at all?

812
00:53:48,764 --> 00:53:50,911
ZAC: I have a three.

813
00:53:50,911 --> 00:53:55,085
MATT: All right, well, first and foremost, Salty
Pete. As they turn around and begin riding back

814
00:53:55,085 --> 00:53:58,944
for a second ride-by, you have your first turn.

815
00:54:00,698 --> 00:54:07,114
DAN: I'm going to try and unfurl an arrow from my
shortbow at the goliath.

816
00:54:07,114 --> 00:54:13,627
MATT: You pull it, go ahead and release the arrow
towards the first illusionary entity. Roll for

817
00:54:13,627 --> 00:54:14,934
attack.

818
00:54:14,934 --> 00:54:18,622
DAN: All right. Where's my-- it's okay. 18.

819
00:54:18,622 --> 00:54:21,316
MATT: 18 does indeed hit. Go ahead and roll damage
on that arrow.

820
00:54:21,316 --> 00:54:25,585
DAN: All right. That is eight points of damage.

821
00:54:25,585 --> 00:54:29,876
MATT: Eight points of damage. Your arrow arcs
across, you can see it strike true in the front of

822
00:54:29,876 --> 00:54:35,075
the armored goliath knight. As it hits it, you can
see its form disperse for a second, attempt to

823
00:54:35,075 --> 00:54:40,000
reform, and a beam of moonlight comes streaking
out of the sky, hits it and it immediately

824
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,949
disintegrates. You can see both it and the tiger's
form roll into ash and vanish before your very

825
00:54:43,949 --> 00:54:45,387
eyes.

826
00:54:45,387 --> 00:54:47,807
DAN: Holy crap! That was awesome.

827
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:49,354
IFY: That's some good stuff right there.

828
00:54:49,354 --> 00:54:50,506
DAN: Did you see what I did?

829
00:54:50,506 --> 00:54:52,449
IFY: That's some good stuff right there.

830
00:54:52,449 --> 00:54:54,023
ZAC: I will give you that one. That was very
impressive.

831
00:54:54,023 --> 00:54:55,528
DAN: I exploded him.

832
00:54:55,528 --> 00:54:57,307
(laughter)

833
00:54:57,307 --> 00:55:00,959
MATT: We had the 20. Who was at the 16? It was the
highest next I believe.

834
00:55:00,959 --> 00:55:02,665
MARISHA: I had a 14.

835
00:55:02,665 --> 00:55:06,613
CHAT ROOM: The stapler starts to glow. Use it to
kill the goliaths.

836
00:55:06,613 --> 00:55:11,382
MATT: The stapler. Who's clutching the stapler? As
you're holding it it begins to shake and glow with

837
00:55:11,382 --> 00:55:13,933
this weird goldish red energy.

838
00:55:13,933 --> 00:55:16,848
DAN: Kill the goliaths!

839
00:55:16,848 --> 00:55:22,055
MATT: At that moment, as you guys are carrying--
you find, though yourself are feeling scared and

840
00:55:22,055 --> 00:55:26,268
cowardly, thus your inability to, this pulls you
to immediate initiative.

841
00:55:26,268 --> 00:55:29,681
ZAC: Oh shit! I rolled a three on initiative!

842
00:55:29,681 --> 00:55:32,479
MATT: I know. This pulls you to the front of the
initiative order with its magical enchantment. I

843
00:55:32,479 --> 00:55:35,563
need you to go ahead and roll and add your
charisma to this.

844
00:55:35,563 --> 00:55:37,607
(laughter)

845
00:55:37,607 --> 00:55:39,611
DAN: Lot of charisma. Nailed it.

846
00:55:39,611 --> 00:55:42,094
(laughter)

847
00:55:43,188 --> 00:55:47,128
ZAC: Eight. I'm rolling poorly!

848
00:55:47,128 --> 00:55:48,284
MATT: Did you add your charisma to it?

849
00:55:48,284 --> 00:55:49,363
ZAC: Yes!

850
00:55:49,363 --> 00:55:55,099
MATT: The stapler, for a second, begins to form
this large, glowing orange orb in the front that

851
00:55:55,099 --> 00:55:59,790
all of a sudden releases the blast, knocking you
off your feet. You land prone on the ground as you

852
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:05,639
guys see this giant burning red metallic staple
flying across the darkened sky towards the entity.

853
00:56:05,639 --> 00:56:11,609
However, the illusion passes underneath it and it
goes, disappearing into the distance.

854
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:17,223
ZAC: I think I should try that again possibly
because that was freaking awesome.

855
00:56:17,223 --> 00:56:18,994
(laughter)

856
00:56:18,994 --> 00:56:22,446
ZAC: I just need to get used to the-- it shakes a
lot, it's hard to aim, but I'm pretty sure I can

857
00:56:22,446 --> 00:56:23,799
hit them.

858
00:56:23,799 --> 00:56:25,471
DAN: Got a bit of recoil.

859
00:56:25,471 --> 00:56:31,771
MATT: You finish your turn getting back to your
feet. Next up, I believe it was you. Edna, yes.

860
00:56:31,771 --> 00:56:41,296
MARISHA: So there's a goliath riding a tiger?
Coming this way? All right. Oh boy, Magic Missile!

861
00:56:41,296 --> 00:56:45,039
MATT: All right, go ahead, Magic Missile, go ahead
and roll damage on that one.

862
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:52,385
MARISHA: I'm going to do all three at him. So 1d4
plus four times three. So that's-- Those are not

863
00:56:52,385 --> 00:56:58,038
good rolls. Six. Rolled ones every time. Six
damage.

864
00:56:58,038 --> 00:56:59,077
MATT: Six total damage?

865
00:56:59,077 --> 00:57:01,425
MARISHA: Yeah. (yelping) Belial!

866
00:57:01,425 --> 00:57:06,661
MATT: As Edna releases this, screaming Belial into
the night air, the missile streaks off into these

867
00:57:06,661 --> 00:57:14,132
three silver darts of arcane energy, smashing into
the sides of this semi-translucent armored

868
00:57:14,132 --> 00:57:17,885
goliath. You can see its form sparking and
shimmering like it's having a hard time keeping

869
00:57:17,885 --> 00:57:23,086
physicality in this world, but it's still
maintaining its position. Riding forward, now

870
00:57:23,086 --> 00:57:27,300
towards you since you are the source of its
initial anger.

871
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:29,651
DAN: You've angered the goliath.

872
00:57:29,651 --> 00:57:31,723
MARISHA: Asmodan.

873
00:57:31,723 --> 00:57:33,486
MATT: Next up, who's the highest initiative?

874
00:57:33,486 --> 00:57:38,078
LIAM: I believe it was me. I forgot to mention
before-- Oh you were? Go for it then.

875
00:57:38,078 --> 00:57:40,535
MATT: Go for it, Quaalude.

876
00:57:40,535 --> 00:57:52,370
ORION: There's a-- so as he's coming towards us
I'll-- I'm going to just do a spin like, hold on

877
00:57:52,370 --> 00:57:55,827
darling, (claps) and do a Thunderwave. And get
thunder.

878
00:57:55,827 --> 00:58:00,949
MATT: Okay. So you move over to get between Edna
and this entity. You release Thunderwave. Is it

879
00:58:00,949 --> 00:58:05,362
just a saving throw on their part, I believe,
right? Yeah. Have your spells ready.

880
00:58:05,362 --> 00:58:07,652
LIAM: Thunderwave.

881
00:58:07,652 --> 00:58:12,765
MARISHA: It's super effective. It's a druid spell.

882
00:58:13,268 --> 00:58:16,665
MATT: Found it first. Okay, so yeah, they have a
constitution saving throw. What's the DC of your

883
00:58:16,665 --> 00:58:18,723
spell?

884
00:58:20,836 --> 00:58:23,097
LIAM: Oh, you didn't prepare it. What's your--

885
00:58:23,097 --> 00:58:26,285
MATT: It doesn't matter, it's a four. All right,
so that's 2d8 damage, it says?

886
00:58:26,285 --> 00:58:28,462
ORION: Yes.

887
00:58:28,462 --> 00:58:31,200
MATT: Actually, you roll that, you roll that
damage, go for it.

888
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:36,255
ORION: Nice. What's that? Eight?

889
00:58:36,255 --> 00:58:41,276
MATT: Okay. So as you rush in front of her, you
put your hand out in front and slam your fist into

890
00:58:41,276 --> 00:58:46,463
the ground. As it does, this giant light wave of
thunderous energy blasts out, flattening all the

891
00:58:46,463 --> 00:58:49,612
damp grasslands around you and sending the
shockwave forward that, as it hits and impacts the

892
00:58:49,612 --> 00:58:55,257
front of the illusion, it casts it into dust as
the wave passes over as it rushes, just about to

893
00:58:55,257 --> 00:59:00,575
strike you. With that, the Thunderwave passes and
the entity is destroyed and is no more.

894
00:59:00,575 --> 00:59:02,757
DAN: Holy crap.

895
00:59:03,033 --> 00:59:08,816
MATT: So as you all stand there, clutching your
glowing, shaking stapler that slowly fades to its

896
00:59:08,816 --> 00:59:12,563
mundane-looking self, the immediate danger seems
to have passed.

897
00:59:12,563 --> 00:59:17,197
MARISHA: Does that stapler still appear to be
magical?

898
00:59:17,197 --> 00:59:19,396
MATT: You go over and take it and as the vibration
is slowly--

899
00:59:19,396 --> 00:59:20,677
ORION: You all right Edna?

900
00:59:20,677 --> 00:59:22,405
MARISHA: What? I'm fine.

901
00:59:22,405 --> 00:59:24,012
ORION: Oh good.

902
00:59:24,012 --> 00:59:28,457
MARISHA: Yes, here. Can I see it? Can I detect any
magic? Does it look pretty meh?

903
00:59:28,457 --> 00:59:33,673
MATT: No. It's definitely radiating some magical
presence. Essentially once per short rest you can

904
00:59:33,673 --> 00:59:42,845
use your action to initiate it and it fires an
arcane, heated giant staple that does, upon

905
00:59:42,845 --> 00:59:47,916
impact, if you manage to hit, does pretty hefty
damage.

906
00:59:47,916 --> 00:59:53,113
LIAM: I walk over to the boy and I kneel down and
I say, listen, and I take the wooden sword out of

907
00:59:53,113 --> 00:59:59,773
his hand and I toss it. You want to fucking let
some blood today? You use one of these. And I've

908
00:59:59,917 --> 01:00:05,349
got-- all I'm wearing is a leather thong and I
have five small iron hammers on my belt, and I

909
01:00:05,349 --> 01:00:11,300
take one out and I say, fucking use this and
you'll paint the blood out of anyone's skull. Use

910
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:14,773
this, Boy-o. It'll work.

911
01:00:14,773 --> 01:00:17,037
DAN: It's hammer time.

912
01:00:17,037 --> 01:00:22,146
MATT: "Of course, of course I will, sir. Oh, I'm
going to smash some skulls in for me dad."

913
01:00:22,146 --> 01:00:25,917
IFY: Oh yeah, that's a good job, son. That's your
uncle now, that's your other uncle.

914
01:00:25,917 --> 01:00:30,066
MARISHA: Stephen, how old are you?

915
01:00:30,066 --> 01:00:32,798
MATT: "This many."

916
01:00:32,798 --> 01:00:36,780
MARISHA: Oh that's good, that's old enough. That's
how old my boys were when they had their first

917
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:41,363
swords, yes, yes, that's a good age.

918
01:00:41,363 --> 01:00:47,849
MATT: You hear a voice echoing from the distance,
"Is it gone?" (panting) "Thank you for saving me,

919
01:00:47,849 --> 01:00:51,075
O Great Soft One."

920
01:00:51,075 --> 01:00:54,676
ZAC: Oh no, it's nothing at all, I'm only bleeding
internally now, thank you so much.

921
01:00:54,676 --> 01:00:56,231
DAN: And externally.

922
01:00:56,231 --> 01:00:57,603
ZAC: Both, yes.

923
01:00:57,603 --> 01:01:01,146
MATT: "Well come on, let's continue onward!" And
he goes running into the swamp. As the small--

924
01:01:01,146 --> 01:01:03,335
ZAC: Why is he still alive?

925
01:01:03,335 --> 01:01:09,725
DAN: Obviously you saved him. You selflessly
sacrificed your body and saved his life.

926
01:01:09,725 --> 01:01:13,728
ZAC: I would do no such thing. I was thrown.

927
01:01:13,728 --> 01:01:19,892
IFY: No, you saved your son. You saved your son.
You're a good dad. You're a real good dad. I love

928
01:01:19,892 --> 01:01:21,556
you.

929
01:01:21,556 --> 01:01:27,400
MATT: Pushing into the swamp proper as you guys
continue inward, you find, about 20 to 25 minutes

930
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:32,248
of walking through, the actual swamp sludge is so
thick that your boots are getting caught and stuck

931
01:01:32,248 --> 01:01:34,695
with each individual step.

932
01:01:34,695 --> 01:01:37,728
MARISHA: This is really bad for my orthopedics.

933
01:01:37,728 --> 01:01:40,697
MATT: Everyone go ahead-- everyone make an
athletics check.

934
01:01:41,934 --> 01:01:45,873
MARISHA: Not my strong suit...that's not a good
roll either.

935
01:01:46,425 --> 01:01:47,701
ZAC: Ten.

936
01:01:47,701 --> 01:01:48,769
DAN: 11.

937
01:01:48,769 --> 01:01:49,713
IFY: 15.

938
01:01:49,713 --> 01:01:51,269
MARISHA: Three.

939
01:01:51,269 --> 01:01:52,720
LIAM: 15.

940
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:54,509
ORION: 15.

941
01:01:54,509 --> 01:02:00,510
MATT: So you guys get about ten minutes in before
you realize that Edna isn't with you. You look

942
01:02:00,510 --> 01:02:01,868
behind you and--

943
01:02:01,868 --> 01:02:03,489
MARISHA: Oh, Asmodan!

944
01:02:03,489 --> 01:02:07,520
MATT: In the distance you see her actually
physically stuck in the muck of the swamp.

945
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:11,583
LIAM: I head back and I pick her up over me
shoulder and I just put her on and I just start

946
01:02:11,583 --> 01:02:13,641
carrying her through the mud.

947
01:02:13,641 --> 01:02:15,587
MARISHA: Watch my back, Cort.

948
01:02:15,587 --> 01:02:17,419
LIAM: Nah, it's good for you, you like it.

949
01:02:20,247 --> 01:02:24,513
MARISHA: (groans) I'm not as nimble as I used to
be.

950
01:02:24,513 --> 01:02:27,048
LIAM: Use it or lose it, lady.

951
01:02:27,048 --> 01:02:32,157
MATT: Who's helming the tracking of this group
trying to find this Cyril, this assistant?

952
01:02:32,157 --> 01:02:33,924
DAN: Not it.

953
01:02:33,924 --> 01:02:36,159
(laughter)

954
01:02:36,159 --> 01:02:38,050
ORION: I'll be at the forefront.

955
01:02:38,050 --> 01:02:40,725
ZAC: He was the one who told us about the swamp. I
believe he--

956
01:02:40,725 --> 01:02:44,605
ORION: I'll use that roll for a 24.

957
01:02:44,605 --> 01:02:51,173
MATT: 24, okay. As you guys are moving forward,
you begin to pick up what looks like recently set

958
01:02:51,173 --> 01:02:56,949
human tracks that are deeply sunken in and leaving
these pools behind in the swamp. So you kind of

959
01:02:56,949 --> 01:03:02,364
start taking charge and everyone begins to follow.
The child, Stephen, is kind of following in step

960
01:03:02,364 --> 01:03:07,449
next to you excited to kind of see that now
there's another leader of the group. You however

961
01:03:07,449 --> 01:03:12,010
are now being very, very closely followed behind
with this slightly under-his-breath cackling and

962
01:03:12,010 --> 01:03:21,221
muttering soot-covered old man who's like, "I
don't get out often, it's nice to see the moon.

963
01:03:21,221 --> 01:03:23,978
Can I touch you again just once more?"

964
01:03:23,978 --> 01:03:27,097
ZAC: Can you leave? I can feel you breathing on my
neck, just back up, please.

965
01:03:27,097 --> 01:03:32,816
MATT: "Good! Good! I'm still breathing. Very good.
Keep that up, I need a reminder every now and

966
01:03:32,816 --> 01:03:38,290
then. Smell this." And he gives you this weird
clump of blackish powder that's in his hand. He

967
01:03:38,290 --> 01:03:40,703
reaches out and puts it in front of your face.

968
01:03:40,703 --> 01:03:44,475
IFY: Oh man, your son is weird, ha!

969
01:03:44,475 --> 01:03:54,703
ZAC: Get that out of my face. If you would just
please be quiet, you can walk beside me.

970
01:03:54,703 --> 01:04:01,254
MATT: "Oh, okay! I will walk beside you. But this,
this may save your life one day." And he shoves it

971
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:03,548
into a pouch at his side.

972
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:07,983
IFY: Hey Snuggle's son! Is that dookie? Is that
dookie you just made him smell? You know, there's

973
01:04:07,983 --> 01:04:12,412
this trick I used to play when I was little. I was
like "Hey, smell this powder," but it was dookie.

974
01:04:12,412 --> 01:04:14,071
DAN: How'd you get it powdered?

975
01:04:14,071 --> 01:04:16,785
IFY: You just punch it a lot.

976
01:04:16,785 --> 01:04:21,212
MATT: In frustration for this conversation,
Snugglelord, in anger you all of a sudden just

977
01:04:21,212 --> 01:04:26,452
flex and for a moment (poof noise), your little
imp familiar appears on your shoulder and just

978
01:04:26,452 --> 01:04:30,173
kind of pats you on the side of your head.

979
01:04:30,173 --> 01:04:34,501
DAN: What the fuck is that?

980
01:04:34,501 --> 01:04:43,110
ZAC: I do in fact have a 'son', per se--

981
01:04:44,544 --> 01:04:46,442
MATT: "I have a brother?"

982
01:04:46,442 --> 01:04:48,306
IFY: Yeah, yeah.

983
01:04:48,306 --> 01:04:52,905
DAN: Oh, is that the nature of your relationship?

984
01:04:52,905 --> 01:04:59,767
ZAC: Yes. I did not want anyone to meet him under
these circumstances, but everyone meet--

985
01:04:59,767 --> 01:05:05,159
CHAT ROOM: Oh no. Liam and Orion accidentally hit
heads and develop Foreign Accent Syndrome. They

986
01:05:05,159 --> 01:05:11,292
now each speak in different foreign accents. Also,
Snugglelord realizes his costume's rear flap has

987
01:05:11,292 --> 01:05:13,691
been open the--

988
01:05:13,691 --> 01:05:15,747
MATT: --entire time.

989
01:05:15,747 --> 01:05:17,310
(laughter)

990
01:05:17,310 --> 01:05:20,717
MATT: So, pick different accents you guys. As
you're walking through the middle of the swamp as

991
01:05:20,717 --> 01:05:24,166
they're having this conversation, he turns around
and you both hit your heads together--

992
01:05:24,166 --> 01:05:30,309
MARISHA: Oh, be careful. I do that all the time.
You got to be careful. I actually have one of

993
01:05:30,309 --> 01:05:34,960
these buttons so I can call for help if I ever
trip and fall down. Yes.

994
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:38,426
IFY: Oh, yeah, yeah. That's cleric alert, right?

995
01:05:38,426 --> 01:05:41,609
MARISHA: It's a life alarm, yes.

996
01:05:41,609 --> 01:05:44,849
IFY: Yeah, yeah. It'll call the cleric to come and
help you out.

997
01:05:44,849 --> 01:05:47,763
ORION: (Russian accent) No problem, I changed different accent, 
I sound different now, yes?

998
01:05:49,889 --> 01:05:54,926
ZAC: The strange imp on my shoulder has now become
the slight-- very much the least awkward thing

999
01:05:54,926 --> 01:05:57,004
that is going on at this moment.

1000
01:05:57,004 --> 01:06:00,114
MATT: Of which, the imp at this point reaches
forward with its smiling, young, boyish, handsome

1001
01:06:00,114 --> 01:06:08,366
face and whispers into your ear, "Uh, Snugglelord?
I'm afraid to let you know your flap is open."

1002
01:06:08,366 --> 01:06:12,303
DAN: Oh, that's embarrassing.

1003
01:06:12,303 --> 01:06:17,276
IFY: I knew it was open the whole time, I was just
looking at his booty.

1004
01:06:17,276 --> 01:06:23,986
ZAC: Grow up, that's where my tail comes out. Get
over it, it is-- It's tiefling anatomy, it's

1005
01:06:23,986 --> 01:06:27,691
totally fine, move on.

1006
01:06:27,691 --> 01:06:30,514
LIAM: (Brooklyn accent) Wait a minute, wait a minute. 
Wait a minute!

1007
01:06:30,688 --> 01:06:33,197
The fuck happened to my fucking Celtic accent?!

1008
01:06:33,197 --> 01:06:39,062
This is fucking bullshit! God damn it, I'm from
the fucking Highlands. The fuck? What are you

1009
01:06:39,062 --> 01:06:44,446
looking at? God damn it. I would like to fucking
rage, and I take out hammers and I just start

1010
01:06:44,446 --> 01:06:51,631
punching the shit out of the trees around me. I'm
fucking angry. God damn it! I used to have a

1011
01:06:51,631 --> 01:06:56,120
fucking charming accent and now I sound like a
fucking mook.

1012
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:59,414
IFY: He's swinging around all them hammers like
that. I guess you could say he's too legit to

1013
01:06:59,414 --> 01:07:00,862
quit, right?

1014
01:07:02,635 --> 01:07:06,120
ORION: I do not understand the reference. I'm so
sorry for you.

1015
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:10,153
MATT: At this, your imp kind of leans in and says,
"My apologies for bothering you, master, but is

1016
01:07:10,153 --> 01:07:12,171
this a bad time?"

1017
01:07:12,171 --> 01:07:22,197
ZAC: Yes. Everyone meet my imp, Lucas.

1018
01:07:22,197 --> 01:07:24,865
MATT: He waves and nods and kind of smiles quietly
at everybody.

1019
01:07:24,865 --> 01:07:26,591
MATT: "Hi."

1020
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:30,020
ZAC: By the way, Lucas is wearing absolutely
nothing except for a Pabst Blue--

1021
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:34,940
MARISHA: What was his name? Mucus? What? Mucus?
That's such a strange name for an imp.

1022
01:07:34,940 --> 01:07:36,536
MATT: Describe him again, sorry.

1023
01:07:36,536 --> 01:07:40,630
ZAC: Lucas is wearing nothing but a Pabst Blue
Ribbon t-shirt and an American flag baseball cap.

1024
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:46,332
I don't know what that is or what it means, but.
No pants. He's an imp.

1025
01:07:46,332 --> 01:07:52,747
MATT: No pants. Got it. It's like a strange,
alternate-dimension Donald Duck.

1026
01:07:55,887 --> 01:07:59,207
MARISHA: I feel like we should do something about
Cort.

1027
01:07:59,681 --> 01:08:05,286
LIAM: Top of the morning to ya. Top of the morning
to-- fucking hell.

1028
01:08:05,286 --> 01:08:09,807
MATT: This angry yelling, by the way, has been
echoing through the forest, and for a split second

1029
01:08:09,807 --> 01:08:16,311
you, Cort, hear this (whizzing noise) as-- what's
your armor class?

1030
01:08:16,969 --> 01:08:19,698
LIAM: My armor class is 16.

1031
01:08:19,698 --> 01:08:24,325
MATT: You hear the sound and instinctively push
out of the way. Your hand slaps what looks like

1032
01:08:24,325 --> 01:08:30,159
some sort of small, wooden shaft that just flies
past you. The rest of you in the middle of this

1033
01:08:30,159 --> 01:08:34,948
moment look around you and you see starting to
crawl out of the nearby trees a bunch of small,

1034
01:08:34,948 --> 01:08:39,202
angry, growling humanoid figures going
(growling).

1035
01:08:39,202 --> 01:08:41,743
IFY: Oh yeah, this them goblins they talking
about.

1036
01:08:41,743 --> 01:08:43,870
DAN: Oh, right, goblins.

1037
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:46,565
IFY: Yo, yo gobs. Yo, what up?

1038
01:08:46,565 --> 01:08:48,061
MATT: Roll initiative.

1039
01:08:48,061 --> 01:08:51,302
MARISHA: Oh, new maps, new maps! New map things!
Look, it's a new thing!

1040
01:08:51,302 --> 01:08:55,728
MATT: So we have over here Snugglelord, Salty
Pete.

1041
01:09:01,198 --> 01:09:03,203
MARISHA: Don't die, Mucus.

1042
01:09:03,945 --> 01:09:08,095
ZAC: My imp just tripped on some cords, I'm
sorry.

1043
01:09:11,849 --> 01:09:14,922
MATT: All right, takes me a minute to set up here,
guys. Make sure you have your initiative numbers

1044
01:09:14,922 --> 01:09:16,211
ready.

1045
01:09:16,211 --> 01:09:19,325
MARISHA: Oh, we're rolling initiative, right.

1046
01:09:19,325 --> 01:09:21,372
IFY: I got a 20.

1047
01:09:21,372 --> 01:09:23,846
MATT: Oh wow. Hold onto that number just for a
second.

1048
01:09:23,846 --> 01:09:29,036
ZAC: I got a six. Oh, sorry, I add one, right?
Yeah, seven.

1049
01:09:29,036 --> 01:09:36,403
MATT: We'll say that this is, next to Snugglelord,
that's Victor. And we'll say that this little

1050
01:09:36,403 --> 01:09:41,976
kobold with the spear is Stephen. All right, so--

1051
01:09:41,976 --> 01:09:45,648
LIAM: When I find the Critter who took my fucking
Irish accent we're going to have words. We're

1052
01:09:45,648 --> 01:09:47,530
going to have words.

1053
01:09:47,530 --> 01:09:49,807
DAN: Certainly not Irish words.

1054
01:09:49,807 --> 01:09:53,857
ORION: He's so much more aggressive than before,
which I did not think was possible.

1055
01:09:54,001 --> 01:09:58,982
ZAC: You actually think a small woodland critter
took your accent from you?

1056
01:09:58,982 --> 01:10:01,388
MATT: Okay, so 25 to 20.

1057
01:10:01,388 --> 01:10:05,631
IFY: I'm 20. I'm up there, ha, yeah.

1058
01:10:05,631 --> 01:10:07,624
MATT: 20 to 15?

1059
01:10:07,624 --> 01:10:09,196
ORION: 15.

1060
01:10:12,416 --> 01:10:18,012
MATT: 15 to ten? Ten to five?

1061
01:10:18,764 --> 01:10:21,499
DAN: Oh. Six.

1062
01:10:21,499 --> 01:10:23,237
ZAC: Seven.

1063
01:10:23,507 --> 01:10:40,042
MATT: Okay. Double fours, all right. All right, as
you see all these goblinoid figures start

1064
01:10:40,042 --> 01:10:45,260
shuffling out from the sides of the trees nearby,
and some seem to be laying low in the swamp and

1065
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:51,965
some have stealthed up upon you, kind of
chittering to themselves. We'll say they're

1066
01:10:51,965 --> 01:10:56,954
preparing for another round of either ranged, kind
of nasty arrows, or some of them are pulling out

1067
01:10:56,954 --> 01:11:00,411
these jagged little bladed elements. Ulfgar, you
have the initiative on this round, ready for

1068
01:11:00,411 --> 01:11:03,466
anything as you are, both swords out.

1069
01:11:03,466 --> 01:11:07,701
IFY: All right, I'm coming right at the first guy
who seems to be loading up the next bolt.

1070
01:11:07,701 --> 01:11:12,345
MATT: Okay. The closest to you would probably be
the one behind you, the one that hit you before.

1071
01:11:12,345 --> 01:11:15,135
All right, so, you go ahead and move up to it,
both swords out--

1072
01:11:15,135 --> 01:11:17,753
IFY: And I swing down at him with both my swords.

1073
01:11:17,753 --> 01:11:20,111
MATT: All right, go ahead and swing for the first
attack.

1074
01:11:20,111 --> 01:11:23,937
IFY: All right. 14.

1075
01:11:23,937 --> 01:11:28,700
MATT: 14. Okay. As you swing with the first one,
it swings down towards it. It manages to catch

1076
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:32,858
purchase on the goblin's body armor but the armor
seems to streak it off to the side and your sword

1077
01:11:32,858 --> 01:11:34,993
plunges into the swamp floor.

1078
01:11:34,993 --> 01:11:41,571
IFY: Ooh. And then with the next one-- one.

1079
01:11:41,571 --> 01:11:50,343
MATT: With the second one you swing down, and this
time the goblin actually reaches up and somehow

1080
01:11:50,343 --> 01:11:53,099
catches the blade in its hand. You're like, "How
could a goblin catch a blade and not cut its own

1081
01:11:53,099 --> 01:11:56,542
hand off?" and you realize you were swinging it
with the flat end for some reason. The goblin goes

1082
01:11:56,542 --> 01:12:01,088
(cackling) and is standing there clutching your
blade, putting you in a very bad position. That

1083
01:12:01,088 --> 01:12:08,851
will end your turn. Alongside you, though, your
new son bravely runs up to your side, clutching

1084
01:12:08,851 --> 01:12:13,665
the hammer that you had, and says, "Leave my dad
alone!" Runs up to the goblin and swings. Natural

1085
01:12:13,665 --> 01:12:16,528
20!

1086
01:12:16,528 --> 01:12:18,887
(yelling)

1087
01:12:18,887 --> 01:12:21,614
IFY: Yes!

1088
01:12:27,226 --> 01:12:31,492
MATT: Double the four, that's eight points of
damage. While you're captured, your seven-year-old

1089
01:12:31,492 --> 01:12:37,318
son goes up with the war hammer and the side of
the goblin's skull explodes to the side. Its grip

1090
01:12:37,318 --> 01:12:40,960
is released as it falls to the ground.

1091
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:45,490
IFY: That's my son! That's my son, he just killed
somebody! Ooh I'm so proud!

1092
01:12:45,490 --> 01:12:48,910
CHAT ROOM: --with his shield tightly for the rest
of the journey.

1093
01:12:48,910 --> 01:12:50,931
MATT: What was that one?

1094
01:12:50,931 --> 01:12:53,232
OFFSCREEN: You're going to love it.

1095
01:12:53,232 --> 01:12:56,060
DAN: I don't think we will.

1096
01:12:56,060 --> 01:13:01,463
MATT: What was that? I'm excited.

1097
01:13:01,463 --> 01:13:05,092
OFFSCREEN: I'll find it.

1098
01:13:05,092 --> 01:13:08,457
MATT: Okay. Bring it to us when you find it. All
right, no worries.

1099
01:13:08,457 --> 01:13:14,831
CHAT ROOM: Salty Pete a.k.a. Sam a.k.a. Money Sam
has a full 22-card Deck of Many Things appear in

1100
01:13:14,831 --> 01:13:21,262
his pocket and immediately plays three cards.
Also, Snugglelord turns into a body pillow.

1101
01:13:22,972 --> 01:13:24,695
OFFSCREEN: 60k.

1102
01:13:24,721 --> 01:13:26,632
MARISHA: Oh, 60k!

1103
01:13:26,632 --> 01:13:30,540
(cheering)

1104
01:13:31,264 --> 01:13:35,519
MARISHA: Yes, someone just threw a Deck of Many
Things on your ass!

1105
01:13:35,519 --> 01:13:39,841
MATT: Why are you guys laughing at me? Deck of
Many Things is a <i>bad</i> thing for you guys.

1106
01:13:39,841 --> 01:13:44,681
MARISHA: It's true. Yeah, we're going to die.
We're going to die.

1107
01:13:44,681 --> 01:13:48,429
MATT: So we'll get to that on your turn. That's
what you'll do on your turn. So suddenly you

1108
01:13:48,429 --> 01:13:52,500
realize-- you feel this strange weight appear in
the back pocket of your suit and you--

1109
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:56,774
DAN: It's real Magic the Gathering in me pocket.

1110
01:13:56,774 --> 01:14:04,022
MATT: All right, we'll get to you next--
With that, that gets us to Quaalude, you're up.

1111
01:14:04,287 --> 01:14:06,463
LIAM: Dance, Mercer, dance.

1112
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:09,665
(laughter)

1113
01:14:09,665 --> 01:14:13,385
ORION: Where am I on the field? I mean to say
(changes accent) where am I on the field? Oh.

1114
01:14:13,385 --> 01:14:18,573
Wonderful. I look at what's going on and go, oh, I
can barely stand this, and turn into a giant great

1115
01:14:18,573 --> 01:14:21,108
big bear.

1116
01:14:21,108 --> 01:14:26,904
IFY: You should've said you could do that back
when we first met him! That's the most exciting

1117
01:14:26,904 --> 01:14:28,171
magic.

1118
01:14:28,171 --> 01:14:30,158
DAN: Yeah, way to bear-y the lead.

1119
01:14:30,158 --> 01:14:33,020
MATT: You turn into a giant bear--

1120
01:14:33,020 --> 01:14:41,805
ORION: Yeah, and it's a brown bear. And, first of
all, I'd like to (bear noises) for a while and

1121
01:14:41,805 --> 01:14:42,816
then--

1122
01:14:42,816 --> 01:14:45,980
MARISHA: Yeah, looks like he's on some serious
hallucinogens.

1123
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:49,282
MATT: All right, we got a goblin here and two
goblins here immediately in your vicinity.

1124
01:14:49,282 --> 01:14:51,457
ORION: All right, where's the Vox Moronica peeps?

1125
01:14:51,457 --> 01:14:57,737
MATT: Well, this is you, this is Edna, and this is
Kort. And over here you have Salty Pete who's the

1126
01:14:57,854 --> 01:15:01,037
pirate dwarf, you have Snugglelord and you have
Ulfgar.

1127
01:15:01,037 --> 01:15:03,599
IFY: And I'm crying, 'cause I'm proud of my son
right now.

1128
01:15:03,599 --> 01:15:07,248
ORION: I'm going to bounce over to the goblin to
my right.

1129
01:15:07,248 --> 01:15:15,847
MATT: Over here? Roll a claw and a bite. Go for
it.

1130
01:15:18,037 --> 01:15:21,106
MATT: (muttering) Deck of Many Things. Jesus Christ, guys.

1131
01:15:21,106 --> 01:15:23,086
DAN: Seriously, holy shit.

1132
01:15:23,086 --> 01:15:24,512
IFY: The deep cuts.

1133
01:15:26,089 --> 01:15:29,807
MARISHA: That wasn't the repeat one, there was
another one as well?

1134
01:15:29,807 --> 01:15:32,996
ORION: The bite misses. Right?

1135
01:15:32,996 --> 01:15:34,860
MATT: What'd you roll to hit?

1136
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:36,162
ORION: Four.

1137
01:15:36,162 --> 01:15:37,607
MATT: Four misses, yeah.

1138
01:15:37,607 --> 01:15:39,047
ORION: And the other one is 18.

1139
01:15:39,047 --> 01:15:42,546
MATT: 18 does hit. Go ahead and roll damage for
the claw attack. The bite, you try and snatch up

1140
01:15:42,546 --> 01:15:45,253
the goblin, it manages to move out to the side,
but you manage to swing your claw wide and manage

1141
01:15:45,253 --> 01:15:47,055
to catch it in the face.

1142
01:15:47,055 --> 01:15:48,428
ORION: Seven damage.

1143
01:15:48,428 --> 01:15:52,700
MATT: Seven damage. As you swing, the claw hits
the side of the goblin's face. You hear it scream

1144
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:56,715
as the claws spear through the side of its jaw and
neck, leaving open its jugular. Bleeds out and

1145
01:15:56,715 --> 01:16:00,802
goes gurgling to the surface of the muddy waters
of the swamp.

1146
01:16:00,802 --> 01:16:04,456
ORION: I'll turn to the other goblin and go,
(roars). And then that's my turn.

1147
01:16:04,456 --> 01:16:07,026
DAN: Did you motorboat his corpse?

1148
01:16:07,026 --> 01:16:08,872
(laughter)

1149
01:16:08,872 --> 01:16:11,560
MATT: By the way, you have enough movement to go
up to him if you want to.

1150
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:15,479
ORION: Uh. Yeah, if I can.

1151
01:16:15,479 --> 01:16:19,085
MATT: Okay, so you move to there. So that goblin,
you're staring him down. He looks very scared,

1152
01:16:19,085 --> 01:16:24,613
watching that you just destroyed his ally. Okay,
that ends your turn. It is now their turn. This

1153
01:16:24,613 --> 01:16:31,930
one turns here. This one rushes into you, this one
comes up to Ulfgar, these two both rush into Salty

1154
01:16:31,930 --> 01:16:39,651
Pete. This one runs in against you. Actually, this
one's probably going to come over to Victor. All

1155
01:16:39,651 --> 01:16:47,303
right, so. First, we're going with it against you.
That is going to be a 14. What's your AC as the

1156
01:16:47,303 --> 01:16:52,456
bear? Okay, that hits. You go ahead and take five
points of slashing damage as its scimitar streaks

1157
01:16:52,456 --> 01:17:00,052
across the exterior of your bear hide. There's
going to be one against you, Kurt. That's not

1158
01:17:00,052 --> 01:17:03,700
going to hit, that's an eight. So as it comes
towards you, you dodge out to the side and knock

1159
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:05,284
it away, it doesn't even get close enough.

1160
01:17:05,284 --> 01:17:07,446
LIAM: Eyy!

1161
01:17:08,286 --> 01:17:11,330
MATT: The one that's coming up behind you--

1162
01:17:11,367 --> 01:17:13,652
MARISHA: Oh, hello there little one!

1163
01:17:13,652 --> 01:17:15,704
MATT: That's going to be an 11 to hit.

1164
01:17:15,704 --> 01:17:17,092
MARISHA: Oh, my AC is 11.

1165
01:17:17,092 --> 01:17:21,243
MATT: 11? All right. You take five points of
slashing damage as it jumps in the air, and arcs

1166
01:17:21,243 --> 01:17:23,240
down with a blade, hitting your back.

1167
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:26,025
MARISHA: Snugglelord, control your son!

1168
01:17:26,025 --> 01:17:28,935
(laughter)

1169
01:17:28,935 --> 01:17:34,999
MATT: The one that's going after Victor, that
hits. As you see one of the goblins rushes out

1170
01:17:34,999 --> 01:17:42,588
with this small spear and jams it into the side of
Victor, the blackpowder merchant, who goes,

1171
01:17:42,588 --> 01:17:46,507
(yelps) "My kidneys!"

1172
01:17:49,057 --> 01:17:51,482
ZAC: Oh, what a fucking shame.

1173
01:17:51,597 --> 01:17:54,533
DAN: That's some goblin dialysis.

1174
01:17:54,905 --> 01:17:58,371
MATT: This goblin here still has his bow out. He's
going to make a bow attack against you, Salty

1175
01:17:58,371 --> 01:18:06,120
Pete. That is a nine against armor class. It just
breaks off the outside of your armor. There are

1176
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:11,480
now two of them-- or no, sorry, there's one that's
going after you, Ulfgar. That is a natural 20. You

1177
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:22,104
take-- okay. Eight points of slashing damage as
the scimitar manages to hit you extremely hard

1178
01:18:22,104 --> 01:18:27,067
about the top of your armor. You can feel the
blade sink in about two inches and hit bone. It's

1179
01:18:27,067 --> 01:18:32,326
not very nice in this part. And this last goblin's
going towards your son, who just bashed the brains

1180
01:18:32,326 --> 01:18:38,769
out of one of its allies. That is going to be an
11, which does hit, because he doesn't have any

1181
01:18:38,769 --> 01:18:40,849
armor on.

1182
01:18:40,849 --> 01:18:45,495
ZAC: Looks like you didn't jump in front of that
attack for your son, there, dumbass!

1183
01:18:45,495 --> 01:18:48,609
MATT: He takes five points of slashing. You see
the other one come out with its scimitar and hack

1184
01:18:48,609 --> 01:18:52,335
into the side of your son. He screams out in pain.
You can see there's a big streak of blood down his

1185
01:18:52,335 --> 01:18:57,542
arm, and one of his arms is hanging limply to the
side. Tears welling up in his eyes when he looks

1186
01:18:57,542 --> 01:19:00,189
at you, like, "Dad?"

1187
01:19:00,189 --> 01:19:02,544
IFY: Don't worry, it's all part of the plan.

1188
01:19:02,544 --> 01:19:08,818
DAN: It'll grow back! Chicks dig scars.

1189
01:19:08,818 --> 01:19:10,532
MATT: And with that, Snugglelord, it's your turn.

1190
01:19:13,324 --> 01:19:18,203
CREW: Just so you know, "A bright light appears
above. It is Snugglelord's lost shield: his

1191
01:19:18,203 --> 01:19:22,640
pillow. He has to equip it for the remainder of
the journey."

1192
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:24,617
MARISHA: Oh! You have a pillow shield.

1193
01:19:24,617 --> 01:19:27,940
MATT: In this moment, you feel a great boon come
down that same star that sparkled in the sky.

1194
01:19:27,940 --> 01:19:30,378
ZAC: Lord, what have you delivered to me?

1195
01:19:30,378 --> 01:19:34,034
MATT: And out of a sudden poof of dark shadow,
this pillow lands into your arms, holding,

1196
01:19:34,553 --> 01:19:40,386
strangely, the visage of both you and some other,
distant hero from another plane of existence. You

1197
01:19:40,386 --> 01:19:45,063
clutch it to yourself, knowing that having it will
give you a plus-two bonus to your armor class.

1198
01:19:45,063 --> 01:19:54,332
ZAC: This is really weird, Lord! Slightly
inappropriate, but I'll take it. Thank you?

1199
01:19:54,332 --> 01:20:00,759
MARISHA: Moving in the right direction. Don't ever
look a gift pillow in the mouth, all right?

1200
01:20:00,759 --> 01:20:03,607
MATT: So. What are you doing on your turn,
Snugglelord?

1201
01:20:03,607 --> 01:20:07,727
ZAC: I would like to Hex the enemy closest to me.
I can't see.

1202
01:20:07,727 --> 01:20:12,212
MATT: All right, the enemy closest to you is,
aside from you guys-- you're right here. There are

1203
01:20:12,212 --> 01:20:14,436
two enemies right here that are pretty close to
you.

1204
01:20:14,436 --> 01:20:15,840
ZAC: My right.

1205
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:18,668
MATT: So right there. This guy here, you mean?

1206
01:20:18,668 --> 01:20:20,287
ZAC: Sure. Doesn't matter.

1207
01:20:20,287 --> 01:20:23,151
MATT: Okay. So this one that's currently attacking
the blackpowder merchant and stabbed him with the

1208
01:20:23,151 --> 01:20:24,313
spear.

1209
01:20:24,313 --> 01:20:27,596
ZAC: Wait, that's the one that's attacking the
blackpowder merchant? I'll attack the other one.

1210
01:20:27,596 --> 01:20:31,250
MATT: Okay. (laughs) You turn to the one that was
firing at Salty Pete.

1211
01:20:31,250 --> 01:20:33,444
ZAC: And I Hex him.

1212
01:20:33,444 --> 01:20:36,497
MATT: You Hex him, okay, it is currently hexed.

1213
01:20:36,497 --> 01:20:45,389
ZAC: And then I attack with the Eldritch Blast.

1214
01:20:45,389 --> 01:20:50,662
MATT: All right, all three of them? How many
Eldritch Blasts can you throw at this level?

1215
01:20:50,662 --> 01:20:59,340
ZAC: I believe just one. But I have the Agonizing
Blast as well, which adds four.

1216
01:20:59,340 --> 01:21:08,491
MATT: Right, okay. So go ahead and roll for an
attack against it. And add your spell attack,

1217
01:21:08,491 --> 01:21:10,597
which I believe is plus six, right?

1218
01:21:10,597 --> 01:21:11,694
ZAC: Eight, then?

1219
01:21:11,694 --> 01:21:12,928
MATT: Eight, okay.

1220
01:21:15,657 --> 01:21:19,615
ZAC: Help me roll better.

1221
01:21:19,615 --> 01:21:22,788
MATT: You come around and you focus, and your eyes
go dark black, and there's a burst of smoke energy

1222
01:21:22,788 --> 01:21:26,991
out the sides as all of a sudden the shadows from
the swamp reach up and cling to the body of this

1223
01:21:26,991 --> 01:21:31,433
goblin. It looks down, freaking out. It is now
currently feeling the entwined dark energy of your

1224
01:21:31,433 --> 01:21:36,916
hex. You put your hand out before it, and you
release a burst of dark arcane energy that goes

1225
01:21:36,916 --> 01:21:39,611
far too wide and strikes one of the nearby trees.
The goblin--

1226
01:21:39,611 --> 01:21:44,300
ZAC: I think the stapler's still having an effect
on me. Can you turn it off? I'd let it go, but I

1227
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:46,550
can't stop shaking.

1228
01:21:46,550 --> 01:21:49,000
MATT: The goblin looks at you and goes (cackles).

1229
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,167
ZAC: Oh, fuck you! I'll get you!

1230
01:21:51,167 --> 01:21:54,876
MATT: The blackpowder merchant is still holding
the spear to the side of him and goes (cackles).

1231
01:21:56,183 --> 01:21:59,353
You can move if you want. It's still your turn.
You can move, and then it'll be the end of your

1232
01:21:59,353 --> 01:22:00,889
turn.

1233
01:22:00,889 --> 01:22:03,655
ZAC: I can move, but can I do Misty Step, or is
that another--

1234
01:22:03,655 --> 01:22:08,446
MATT: Misty Step's a bonus action. You can only
move. Nothing's currently in melee with you, so

1235
01:22:08,446 --> 01:22:11,132
you can move however you want right now.

1236
01:22:11,132 --> 01:22:13,782
ORION: Let's just move away from Salty Pete.

1237
01:22:13,782 --> 01:22:18,315
DAN: Yeah, it's gonna get real messy in one
second.

1238
01:22:18,315 --> 01:22:22,955
ZAC: I'm going to move away from the blackpowder
merchant, and as I'm running away, I'm like, fend

1239
01:22:22,955 --> 01:22:25,422
for yourself!

1240
01:22:25,422 --> 01:22:29,852
MATT: Okay. And with that, Salty Pete, it's your
turn!

1241
01:22:29,852 --> 01:22:35,614
DAN: What's this in me pocket? It's some sort of
deck of many things.

1242
01:22:35,917 --> 01:22:39,599
ZAC: Wait, did you say 'dick'? There's a dick in
your pocket?

1243
01:22:39,599 --> 01:22:41,449
DAN: Deck.

1244
01:22:41,449 --> 01:22:44,981
ZAC: Did you say there's a dick in your pocket?

1245
01:22:44,981 --> 01:22:48,648
DAN: I'm just happy to see you. The answer is
both.

1246
01:22:48,648 --> 01:22:52,205
MATT: Is there a deck of cards somewhere, by the
way, guys? That's usually how this is played.

1247
01:22:52,205 --> 01:22:54,352
LIAM: An actual deck. We need an actual deck.

1248
01:22:54,352 --> 01:22:57,853
ORION: I only have my bullshit.

1249
01:22:57,853 --> 01:23:00,097
MATT: That's fine. We'll use what you have there.

1250
01:23:00,097 --> 01:23:02,015
ORION: Oh, shit, okay.

1251
01:23:02,015 --> 01:23:07,623
MATT: So go ahead and hand it to Salty Pete. Go
ahead and pull three of those.

1252
01:23:07,623 --> 01:23:11,907
DAN: Saints preserve us!

1253
01:23:11,907 --> 01:23:14,223
ORION: Let me shuffle-- that's fine, they're
shuffled.

1254
01:23:14,223 --> 01:23:16,633
ZAC: I'm still unclear. You have a dick in your
pocket--

1255
01:23:16,633 --> 01:23:18,605
DAN: Oh, you'll find out.

1256
01:23:18,605 --> 01:23:21,851
MATT: You draw three of them.

1257
01:23:22,380 --> 01:23:26,167
MARISHA: Draw good ones!

1258
01:23:26,167 --> 01:23:29,513
DAN: All right. Shall I flip the cards?

1259
01:23:29,513 --> 01:23:32,516
MATT: Yep. Go ahead.

1260
01:23:32,516 --> 01:23:40,910
DAN: King of diamonds, two of clubs, and two of
diamonds.

1261
01:23:40,910 --> 01:23:43,844
MATT: So, king of diamonds, you said?

1262
01:23:43,844 --> 01:23:53,947
DAN: King of diamonds, two of clubs, and two of
diamonds. We have many things in store.

1263
01:23:53,947 --> 01:23:56,022
ZAC: Well, that's not good. The DM's laughing.

1264
01:23:56,022 --> 01:24:00,911
MATT: You pull out the first card. Suddenly,
within your hands, it bursts into a golden flame.

1265
01:24:00,911 --> 01:24:04,556
Looking into it, your eyes spark, and the
experience of a thousand generations of your

1266
01:24:04,556 --> 01:24:08,944
family past come coursing into your body. You gain
50,000 experience points.

1267
01:24:08,944 --> 01:24:10,003
ALL: What?

1268
01:24:10,003 --> 01:24:12,502
MATT: You gain 50,000 experience points.

1269
01:24:12,502 --> 01:24:14,331
DAN: What the fucking christ?

1270
01:24:15,131 --> 01:24:17,191
MARISHA: You just went to like level 12.

1271
01:24:17,627 --> 01:24:21,007
ZAC: Super-Saiyan, man!

1272
01:24:21,007 --> 01:24:24,603
IFY: Hey, give me those cards!

1273
01:24:24,603 --> 01:24:29,359
MARISHA: Hey, shut up! Oh, we didn't hear it. No,
we were bitching.

1274
01:24:29,359 --> 01:24:38,944
CREW: "The guild laments the loss of your accent
and gifts you this blessed banhammer of doom."

1275
01:24:38,944 --> 01:24:42,820
MATT: There you have it. Banhammer of doom is
yours. Also acquired within your hands--

1276
01:24:42,820 --> 01:24:46,237
ZAC: I'm confused, because she said the loss of my
accent, but I didn't lose one.

1277
01:24:46,237 --> 01:24:48,736
LIAM: Salty Pete is now level nine.

1278
01:24:48,736 --> 01:24:52,165
(laughter)

1279
01:24:52,165 --> 01:24:56,329
MATT: So go ahead and roll 5d10 and add that to
your hit points.

1280
01:24:56,329 --> 01:25:03,409
MARISHA: That's amazing! Also, you get some fun
new abilities real quick.

1281
01:25:03,409 --> 01:25:09,963
MATT: It'll take a while, so we'll just go with
it. Add your hit points. You can tell him what

1282
01:25:09,963 --> 01:25:18,735
happens. All right, so. And the crossbow that's in
your hand all of a sudden fires aglow with bluish

1283
01:25:18,735 --> 01:25:25,160
magical energy. It's now considered a +2 magical
crossbow. So the second card you pulled is what?

1284
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:35,499
DAN: That was one card? All right, the second card
was a two of clubs. Classic card.

1285
01:25:38,019 --> 01:25:39,019
MATT: (laughs)

1286
01:25:39,019 --> 01:25:40,039
DAN: Oh, shit.

1287
01:25:42,079 --> 01:25:45,487
MATT: All right. Your intelligence is now
permanently five lower.

1288
01:25:47,066 --> 01:25:50,923
DAN: Oh, that's-- I'm feeling fucking stupid.

1289
01:25:51,359 --> 01:25:53,893
ALL: (laughing)

1290
01:25:56,780 --> 01:25:59,923
MATT: You're allowed to draw an additional card if
you choose to.

1291
01:25:59,923 --> 01:26:03,393
DAN: Oh, 100%.

1292
01:26:03,393 --> 01:26:05,249
MATT: What's the third one you drew?

1293
01:26:05,249 --> 01:26:07,570
DAN: It's two of diamonds.

1294
01:26:13,091 --> 01:26:17,882
MATT: Okay. If you singlehandedly defeat the next
hostile monster you encounter, you gain experience

1295
01:26:17,882 --> 01:26:20,828
points enough to gain another level.

1296
01:26:20,828 --> 01:26:24,729
DAN: I'm doing it! My fourth card is the queen of
clubs.

1297
01:26:26,629 --> 01:26:28,357
MATT: Oh no.

1298
01:26:29,535 --> 01:26:31,900
DAN: This is going to end quickly.

1299
01:26:32,496 --> 01:26:38,911
MATT: Okay. The card disappears in a flicker of
fire, but you see in your mind, suddenly, your

1300
01:26:38,911 --> 01:26:46,664
vision press deep into the Nine Hells. You see a
large pit fiend demon all of a sudden glare back

1301
01:26:46,664 --> 01:26:54,761
and go, "Salty Pete. You are my quarry." And then
vanish in flame, just as the card did. You don't

1302
01:26:54,761 --> 01:26:59,308
know what happened, but you get the feeling
something very dangerous is now hunting you.

1303
01:26:59,308 --> 01:27:03,901
DAN: Yeah, I've got a horrible feeling.

1304
01:27:06,333 --> 01:27:08,207
ORION: So did that happen instead of the
intelligence thing?

1305
01:27:08,207 --> 01:27:13,647
MATT: No, that happened as well. Deck of many
things, guys.

1306
01:27:13,647 --> 01:27:16,022
ZAC: Your hair just turned blond.

1307
01:27:16,022 --> 01:27:17,975
DAN: I'm stupid now.

1308
01:27:17,975 --> 01:27:19,475
ZAC: Didn't know that. Good to know.

1309
01:27:19,475 --> 01:27:20,989
DAN: I've got a glowing blue--

1310
01:27:23,679 --> 01:27:29,358
IFY: I just want to know if I really did just feel
the presence of a demon pointing at you.

1311
01:27:29,822 --> 01:27:37,434
DAN: 100%. It kind of looked like that, but a
little bit meaner and not a waifu pillow.

1312
01:27:38,432 --> 01:27:41,293
ORION: And like four times the size, right?

1313
01:27:41,293 --> 01:27:44,426
LIAM: Matt, can we take intermission at some
point?

1314
01:27:44,426 --> 01:27:55,189
MATT: I'm going to right after this battle. Okay.
That ends your turn. So add your hit points. I'll

1315
01:27:55,189 --> 01:27:58,475
give you the sneak attack bonus that he gets now.

1316
01:27:58,475 --> 01:28:01,480
MARISHA: You can probably add more points to your
intelligence.

1317
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:03,753
ZAC: Did you put this hammer in my hands?

1318
01:28:03,753 --> 01:28:07,835
DAN: No, I didn't.

1319
01:28:07,835 --> 01:28:12,325
MATT: All of your attacks and skills are also plus
two. Kurt, you're up. Kurt and Edna.

1320
01:28:12,325 --> 01:28:15,879
LIAM: Where's the boy? Where's the boy?

1321
01:28:15,879 --> 01:28:18,462
MATT: Little boy is right here.

1322
01:28:18,615 --> 01:28:22,149
ORION: Don't kill the one next to Salty Pete. He
has to take that one out.

1323
01:28:22,149 --> 01:28:24,906
LIAM: I want to walk over to the goblin. I know
there's one right behind me, I'm just going to

1324
01:28:24,906 --> 01:28:29,167
keep walking. If it takes a swing, I don't give a
fuck. I don't give a fuck, yeah. I'm going to walk

1325
01:28:29,167 --> 01:28:31,288
towards the goblins by the boy. Yeah.

1326
01:28:31,505 --> 01:28:34,184
CREW: The gods were unclear.

1327
01:28:34,743 --> 01:28:37,039
LIAM: And now, you
might not have noticed it before, guys, but I got

1328
01:28:37,039 --> 01:28:39,387
almost-- what do I got?

1329
01:28:39,387 --> 01:28:43,232
CREW: This is for the loss of your accent.

1330
01:28:43,232 --> 01:28:48,285
LIAM: Does it come back? I get a prop toy?

1331
01:28:48,285 --> 01:28:53,911
ZAC: What kind of sick game are the gods playing
on me?! You give me a pillow and a hammer and then

1332
01:28:53,911 --> 01:28:57,333
take the hammer away and I'm left with the fucking
pillow?

1333
01:28:57,333 --> 01:29:02,686
MATT: The hammer, all of a sudden, the edge of it
bursts into flames through the sheer force of

1334
01:29:02,686 --> 01:29:07,548
frustration and anger. Your accent does not come
back, but you feel the vengeance for losing it now

1335
01:29:07,548 --> 01:29:10,553
is coursing through the actual weapon that you
hold.

1336
01:29:10,553 --> 01:29:14,360
LIAM: So I walk over to him, and you guys might
not have noticed this before, but I got nothing on

1337
01:29:14,360 --> 01:29:20,499
but leather thongs and a tattoo of a badger on my
chest. Half of my chest is a tattoo of a badger,

1338
01:29:20,499 --> 01:29:24,587
and I'm already in a rage, because right before
the fight started, I went into a rage. I take my

1339
01:29:24,587 --> 01:29:31,643
free hand and I fucking rake it down my chest, and
I say, let's go, Gary! And take my warpick off my

1340
01:29:31,643 --> 01:29:36,872
back, and I want to recklessly attack the one that
struck the boy. I want to split him right down the

1341
01:29:36,872 --> 01:29:38,986
fucking middle.

1342
01:29:38,986 --> 01:29:40,840
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll for the
attack.

1343
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:44,082
ZAC: You're going to not use the hammer that just
started glowing?

1344
01:29:44,082 --> 01:29:46,313
MARISHA: Use the hammer!

1345
01:29:46,313 --> 01:29:53,134
LIAM: Am I getting a magic weapon? Is that what
this is? It's unclear. All right. So I'm going to

1346
01:29:53,134 --> 01:29:59,914
use this magic weapon. I'm attacking recklessly. I
got two 17s, so that's a 21.

1347
01:29:59,914 --> 01:30:06,497
MATT: 21 hits. All right, so go ahead and roll the
damage for one of your regular weapons, and add

1348
01:30:06,497 --> 01:30:10,032
1d6 flaming damage to it.

1349
01:30:10,751 --> 01:30:19,453
LIAM: (counting) 12.

1350
01:30:19,453 --> 01:30:25,079
MATT: 12. You walk up and just smash it into the
mud. The actual flames cause a sizzling sound as

1351
01:30:25,079 --> 01:30:32,405
it hits the marshy ground. What was once a goblin
is now a charred and liquefied mess.

1352
01:30:32,405 --> 01:30:38,390
LIAM: The blood splashes onto me, and I look down
at the kid, and I wipe it off my face, and I wipe

1353
01:30:38,390 --> 01:30:42,162
it down his head, and I say, today you are a man.

1354
01:30:42,162 --> 01:30:46,999
IFY: I look at Stephen, and I'm like, it's all
part of the plan.

1355
01:30:46,999 --> 01:30:50,357
MATT: Edna. What are you going to do?

1356
01:30:50,357 --> 01:31:01,409
MARISHA: All right, so I have one guy on my butt?
Okay, so question. Jesus. Oh, goodness me. As part

1357
01:31:01,409 --> 01:31:10,051
of being a conjuration wizard, I can do a minor
conjuration as an action, and I can just conjure

1358
01:31:10,051 --> 01:31:16,673
things that are up to ten pounds. Can I conjure a
ten-pound rock over his head?

1359
01:31:16,673 --> 01:31:18,370
MATT: You could, yes.

1360
01:31:18,370 --> 01:31:23,912
MARISHA: Okay. So I'm going to turn around and be
like, I told you to get your son away from me,

1361
01:31:23,912 --> 01:31:27,579
Snugglelord! And I drop a ten-pound rock on his
head.

1362
01:31:27,579 --> 01:31:31,174
MATT: Okay. It appears. Just go ahead and roll a
d20 and add your intelligence modifier to it, to

1363
01:31:31,174 --> 01:31:37,033
see how you're able to conjure it in the right
space above it. What'd you roll? You rolled a one.

1364
01:31:37,033 --> 01:31:43,102
Okay. So here's what happens. Make a dexterity
saving throw. As you finish your conjuration, you

1365
01:31:43,102 --> 01:31:47,146
go, this way! And the rock appears right above
you.

1366
01:31:47,146 --> 01:31:48,867
ORION: Four.

1367
01:31:48,867 --> 01:31:51,021
MATT: Four. You take--

1368
01:31:51,021 --> 01:31:53,221
MARISHA: Five total.

1369
01:31:53,221 --> 01:31:58,404
MATT: You take four points of bludgeoning damage
as the rock slams down onto your head. You can

1370
01:31:58,404 --> 01:32:02,863
feel your neck jostle and your whole head ringing
for a second.

1371
01:32:02,863 --> 01:32:05,361
MARISHA: I'm still new at this! I'm still
learning.

1372
01:32:05,361 --> 01:32:08,741
IFY: Somebody save grandma!
Somebody go in there and save grandma!

1373
01:32:08,741 --> 01:32:11,659
MARISHA: What? Belial! What?

1374
01:32:11,659 --> 01:32:13,593
MATT: Ulfgar, you're up.

1375
01:32:14,519 --> 01:32:20,612
IFY: So now I look at this goblin fronting me,
it's like, guess what? Today you made a mistake.

1376
01:32:20,612 --> 01:32:26,537
First mistake: walking up into this swamp. Second
mistake: messing with me and my son and my family

1377
01:32:26,537 --> 01:32:30,783
I have here. I've got grandma over there who just
got hit by a rock. I've got--

1378
01:32:30,783 --> 01:32:33,497
ZAC: A rock she dropped on her own head, mind
you.

1379
01:32:33,497 --> 01:32:39,424
IFY: Semantics. So I'll sweep with Linda and
Regina.

1380
01:32:39,476 --> 01:32:41,325
MATT: Okay.

1381
01:32:41,955 --> 01:32:48,377
IFY: First one swings for-- goodness. 23.

1382
01:32:48,377 --> 01:32:53,498
MATT: That hits. Go for it, yeah.

1383
01:32:53,498 --> 01:32:56,097
IFY: And the second one is a one.

1384
01:32:56,097 --> 01:32:57,941
MATT: Okay. Roll damage on the first one.

1385
01:32:57,941 --> 01:33:08,575
IFY: All right, so for the first one. Where's that
d8? There it is. So nine.

1386
01:33:08,575 --> 01:33:13,251
MATT: Nine points of damage. As you bring your
first sword down, it embeds itself about seven

1387
01:33:13,251 --> 01:33:18,073
inches into the chest of this small goblin, who
looks at you, twitching, its eyes slowly rolling

1388
01:33:18,073 --> 01:33:23,719
back in its head. With a big grin, you bring your
second blade down and swing it outward. It cleaves

1389
01:33:23,719 --> 01:33:28,064
his torso in two, but the inertia pulls outward in
the direction of your son.

1390
01:33:28,064 --> 01:33:31,369
IFY: No!

1391
01:33:31,369 --> 01:33:37,512
MATT: Go ahead and just roll a d20.

1392
01:33:37,512 --> 01:33:40,523
IFY: 18.

1393
01:33:40,523 --> 01:33:44,900
MATT: 18, okay. You manage to steel your will
enough to stop the blade but an inch from his

1394
01:33:44,900 --> 01:33:49,986
face, the metal sitting there and shimmering with
power. He looks at you with a moment of sudden

1395
01:33:50,110 --> 01:33:51,877
confusion and fright.

1396
01:33:51,877 --> 01:33:53,894
IFY: It's all part of the plan.

1397
01:33:53,894 --> 01:34:00,329
ZAC: I think that small boy you took away from
wherever he may be from just wet himself. He

1398
01:34:00,329 --> 01:34:02,224
definitely peed himself.

1399
01:34:02,224 --> 01:34:04,829
MATT: Quaalude, you're up.

1400
01:34:04,829 --> 01:34:09,822
ORION: Oh. Roar! And he's still on me?

1401
01:34:09,822 --> 01:34:13,424
MATT: Go for it. Bite/claw attack on him. (laughs)

1402
01:34:16,721 --> 01:34:20,722
ORION: What is this, my dex?

1403
01:34:20,722 --> 01:34:22,622
LIAM: Strength or dex for him?

1404
01:34:22,622 --> 01:34:25,379
MATT: This is your attack, yeah, strength. The
attack bonus should be with the bear's stat

1405
01:34:25,379 --> 01:34:26,952
block.

1406
01:34:26,952 --> 01:34:29,369
LIAM: You weren't prepared for that, were you?

1407
01:34:29,369 --> 01:34:31,905
MATT: I've got the monster manual right here. If
you're a druid--

1408
01:34:31,905 --> 01:34:35,462
MARISHA: It's a brown bear, right? At the very,
very back.

1409
01:34:36,791 --> 01:34:39,224
MATT: Brown bear, there you go. Plus five to hit.

1410
01:34:39,224 --> 01:34:42,543
LIAM: Plus five to both of those. 17 and 12.

1411
01:34:43,603 --> 01:34:50,415
MATT: So 17 and 12? 17 hits. So the first attack
hits. That would be your bite.

1412
01:34:50,415 --> 01:34:58,141
ORION: Okay, sure. Yeah. That's 1d8?

1413
01:34:58,141 --> 01:35:00,670
MATT: 1d8 plus the strength modifier.

1414
01:35:04,996 --> 01:35:09,156
MARISHA: Plus strength. Five, right? What's your strength?
Plus two.

1415
01:35:09,156 --> 01:35:10,411
ORION: Oh, five.

1416
01:35:10,616 --> 01:35:15,991
MATT: Five points of damage. You bite at it with
your bite, get a big old chunk of its shoulder and

1417
01:35:15,991 --> 01:35:20,452
tear it off, and it screams out in pain, the dark
blood of the goblin pouring down, but it's still

1418
01:35:20,452 --> 01:35:24,508
standing angrily at you. As you swipe your claw at
it, it ducks back out of the way, and it looks at

1419
01:35:24,508 --> 01:35:28,093
you with this foam at the edge of its mouth.

1420
01:35:28,093 --> 01:35:32,923
LIAM: Is it the bear's strength bonus? Add two
more points of damage to that.

1421
01:35:32,923 --> 01:35:39,227
MATT: So it would be seven total. So as it darts
back and looks at you, growling, it's lost way too

1422
01:35:39,227 --> 01:35:46,231
much blood and tries to make a swipe at you, but
falls face-first down into the swamp. You can feel

1423
01:35:46,231 --> 01:35:51,588
the gurgling of its final breath pulling out into
the water at the top of the marsh. It is gone.

1424
01:35:51,588 --> 01:35:55,136
ORION: Oh. Sweet. That made a big difference.

1425
01:35:55,853 --> 01:35:57,636
MATT: You can still move if you want.

1426
01:35:57,636 --> 01:35:59,463
MARISHA: Help me!

1427
01:35:59,463 --> 01:36:03,087
ORION: Where's Edna? Let me go--

1428
01:36:03,087 --> 01:36:05,404
MARISHA: I've hit my head and I can't get up.

1429
01:36:06,075 --> 01:36:08,180
ZAC: Hit your stupid button!

1430
01:36:08,304 --> 01:36:11,836
ORION: I have that chunk still in my mouth that I
ripped off, yeah? I'm going to spit it in the

1431
01:36:11,836 --> 01:36:13,858
goblin's face.

1432
01:36:13,858 --> 01:36:17,568
MATT: Okay. Make an intimidation check.

1433
01:36:17,568 --> 01:36:23,134
LIAM: Wow, it rolled up on the dice. Not too
good.

1434
01:36:23,134 --> 01:36:29,128
MATT: The goblin catches it in its mouth and
starts chewing. Yeah, goblins are a little weird.

1435
01:36:29,128 --> 01:36:35,392
All right, that brings it to their turn.
Strangely, this fight-- most goblins are very

1436
01:36:35,392 --> 01:36:40,057
cowardly creatures, but you start noticing in
these goblins as you're fighting them, all of

1437
01:36:40,057 --> 01:36:44,296
their eyes are clouded over, and they're fighting
with a fervor and a perpetual anger where they

1438
01:36:44,296 --> 01:36:49,605
don't even really notice the danger they're in.
This is uncommon to a species that is generally

1439
01:36:49,605 --> 01:36:54,809
cowardly by nature. The goblin that you just
finished chewing looks at you and lashes out at

1440
01:36:54,809 --> 01:37:03,303
you with its scimitar. That is going to be a 20.
Hits, okay. You take five points of slashing

1441
01:37:03,303 --> 01:37:08,580
damage as it arcs its scimitar across your bear
form, leaving another big streak of slash damage

1442
01:37:08,580 --> 01:37:16,876
across the front of your body. We have the
goblin that is hexed. It is going to be attacking

1443
01:37:17,123 --> 01:37:21,181
you, Salty Pete. That is going to be a 17 to hit.

1444
01:37:21,181 --> 01:37:22,768
DAN: That hits.

1445
01:37:22,768 --> 01:37:27,190
MATT: All right, so for that, you take five points
of piercing damage from a shortbow arrow that

1446
01:37:27,190 --> 01:37:29,247
(impact) into your back.

1447
01:37:29,247 --> 01:37:31,183
DAN: I can afford it.

1448
01:37:31,183 --> 01:37:33,073
OFF-SCREEN: Incoming message.

1449
01:37:33,073 --> 01:37:36,512
MATT: Okay.

1450
01:37:37,276 --> 01:37:39,888
DAN: The anticipation is quite literally killing
me.

1451
01:37:39,888 --> 01:37:44,459
CHAT ROOM: Whenever an ally is injured,
Snugglelord has the uncontrollable urge to hug

1452
01:37:44,459 --> 01:37:48,237
them and they heal.

1453
01:37:48,237 --> 01:37:50,570
LIAM: Aw, that's sweet.

1454
01:37:50,725 --> 01:37:55,496
MATT: So you see this arrow sticking out of your
ally's back, and you suddenly feel like, oh no! I

1455
01:37:55,496 --> 01:37:59,367
need to go and help my friend! But we'll get to
your turn--

1456
01:37:59,367 --> 01:38:01,755
ZAC: When the fuck would I ever say or do that?!

1457
01:38:01,755 --> 01:38:03,831
(laughter)

1458
01:38:03,831 --> 01:38:08,033
MATT: We'll get to your turn when we get there.
All right, so. The one is going to be attacking

1459
01:38:08,033 --> 01:38:15,104
the powder merchant. It misses. You now have--
this one is off on the side. It is going to rush

1460
01:38:15,104 --> 01:38:23,555
up towards the Snugglelord now with its scimitar
in the air, and that's going to be a 14 to hit.

1461
01:38:23,555 --> 01:38:24,905
What's your AC?

1462
01:38:24,905 --> 01:38:28,372
ZAC: More than that. I have my trusty pillow. 15.

1463
01:38:28,567 --> 01:38:32,249
MATT: 15, that'll do. You hold your pillow out in
front of you, and the blade arcs off, sparks

1464
01:38:32,249 --> 01:38:35,375
flying, almost like the exterior of the pillow is
iron for a split-second.

1465
01:38:35,375 --> 01:38:38,477
ZAC: What the shit?!

1466
01:38:38,477 --> 01:38:40,858
MATT: Bringing it to your turn, Snugglelord.

1467
01:38:40,858 --> 01:38:45,706
CHAT ROOM: A black unicorn randomly appears and
permanently attaches itself to Snugglelord's

1468
01:38:45,706 --> 01:38:47,826
loins.

1469
01:38:47,826 --> 01:38:50,467
(laughter)

1470
01:38:50,467 --> 01:38:55,663
MATT: As this happens, you feel this urge to heal
your friend, you hear this tiny (hoofbeats) and

1471
01:38:55,663 --> 01:39:01,082
you see this really, really small pitch-black
unicorn comes up and runs up and just latches

1472
01:39:01,082 --> 01:39:06,111
itself to the outside of your crotch and forms
this protective barrier.

1473
01:39:06,111 --> 01:39:08,050
ORION: Unicorn codpiece!

1474
01:39:08,050 --> 01:39:11,189
DAN: You've got a unicock.

1475
01:39:11,189 --> 01:39:14,437
ZAC: Look, we both leveled up, Salty Pete.

1476
01:39:14,437 --> 01:39:17,109
MATT: So it's your turn.

1477
01:39:17,109 --> 01:39:18,814
ZAC: So now am I--

1478
01:39:18,814 --> 01:39:22,270
MATT: You're right here, this goblin's in front of
you. You feel the uncontrollable urge to go and

1479
01:39:22,270 --> 01:39:26,718
help someone who's been wounded recently, which
would be either Edna or Salty Pete.

1480
01:39:28,464 --> 01:39:31,098
(laughter)

1481
01:39:31,098 --> 01:39:32,978
LIAM: Work that unicorn, girl!

1482
01:39:32,978 --> 01:39:34,317
ZAC: Edna, I feel--

1483
01:39:34,317 --> 01:39:36,485
MARISHA: What? I'm sorry, you're going to have to
speak up--

1484
01:39:36,485 --> 01:39:38,335
ZAC: The Shathroom is drawing me towards you.

1485
01:39:38,335 --> 01:39:39,095
MARISHA: What?

1486
01:39:39,095 --> 01:39:44,265
ZAC: The Shathroom is commanding me to help you,
to heal you, I don't want to do it, but it's--

1487
01:39:44,265 --> 01:39:45,932
MARISHA: Oh, Asmodan.

1488
01:39:45,932 --> 01:39:49,673
ZAC: It's making me do it! (strained sounds)

1489
01:39:49,673 --> 01:39:55,893
MATT: So you move to her. Put you there, it's
fine. The urge makes you move a little bit faster

1490
01:39:55,893 --> 01:39:59,352
than you normally would. You get up to her, but
the goblin does get one swipe at you as you run

1491
01:39:59,365 --> 01:40:05,593
by. That is a 16. You take five points of slashing
damage as the blade streaks across the back of

1492
01:40:05,593 --> 01:40:07,991
your tiefling form.

1493
01:40:07,991 --> 01:40:10,102
ZAC: "Ah! This is stupid!"

1494
01:40:10,102 --> 01:40:14,245
MATT: You rush up and hug Edna from behind--
go ahead and roll a d8.

1495
01:40:15,095 --> 01:40:18,975
MARISHA: I missed you too, Snugglelord.

1496
01:40:18,975 --> 01:40:21,396
MATT: Go ahead and roll a d8, Snugglelord.

1497
01:40:21,396 --> 01:40:25,035
MARISHA and LIAM: The unicock!

1498
01:40:27,001 --> 01:40:28,347
ZAC: It's a three.

1499
01:40:28,347 --> 01:40:33,483
MATT: Three. You heal three points of damage from
the warm embrace of the Snugglelord. And you

1500
01:40:33,483 --> 01:40:39,608
almost take damage from the piercing of the tiny
unicorn horn in the side of your hip.

1501
01:40:39,608 --> 01:40:44,615
ZAC: It's like holding legos in a pantyhose! This
is gross! Ugh!

1502
01:40:44,615 --> 01:40:47,539
MATT: Salty Pete, who is now the Conan of this
adventure, it's your--

1503
01:40:47,539 --> 01:40:57,434
DAN: I'm feeling great! So, is it possible to use
my cunning action to hide until I go into

1504
01:40:57,434 --> 01:40:59,178
stealth?

1505
01:40:59,178 --> 01:41:02,750
MATT: You have to really be in a situation where
you can hide properly.

1506
01:41:02,750 --> 01:41:07,732
LIAM: You can run up to any enemy who's five feet
away from one of your allies and distract them.

1507
01:41:07,732 --> 01:41:12,065
MATT: Which, by the way, currently the powder
merchant is fighting this guy, so this guy you

1508
01:41:12,065 --> 01:41:16,392
could still do some sneak attack damage if you hit
it. You just want to try and get away from it

1509
01:41:16,392 --> 01:41:20,114
because if you're attacking with a crossbow, you
have disadvantage if it's right up next to you.

1510
01:41:20,114 --> 01:41:23,384
DAN: Got you. All right, and there's a guy who's
right next to me as well?

1511
01:41:23,384 --> 01:41:25,986
MATT: Right there, yeah.

1512
01:41:25,986 --> 01:41:34,094
DAN: Okay. All right, I'm going to use my cunning
action to disengage. Here we go, pretty cunning!

1513
01:41:34,094 --> 01:41:36,499
MATT: Where do you want to go from there? Do you
want to move--

1514
01:41:36,499 --> 01:41:39,890
DAN: I'd like to get behind him so I can flank him
with my sword.

1515
01:41:39,890 --> 01:41:42,144
MATT: Okay, so you move over there.

1516
01:41:42,144 --> 01:41:44,214
ZAC: Do you need my magical codpiece for this?

1517
01:41:44,214 --> 01:41:49,226
DAN: No! You're fine, just hug the lady on the
ground!

1518
01:41:49,226 --> 01:41:52,581
MATT: So you pull your sword out? Go ahead and
roll for an attack.

1519
01:41:54,404 --> 01:41:58,238
DAN: Okay. It's a 20, not natural, though.

1520
01:41:58,238 --> 01:42:01,275
MATT: Okay that hits! Go ahead and roll damage
plus sneak attack.

1521
01:42:01,275 --> 01:42:05,398
DAN: All right! That's going to be a lot, I need
6d6.

1522
01:42:05,398 --> 01:42:07,596
(laughter)

1523
01:42:07,596 --> 01:42:10,367
DAN: That's stupid.

1524
01:42:10,367 --> 01:42:17,660
LIAM: I played as a rogue for three years before I
could do that!

1525
01:42:17,660 --> 01:42:22,528
DAN: Listen, there's many things that are going to
happen tonight.

1526
01:42:22,528 --> 01:42:26,100
ORION: Annihilation! He's dead! Whatever it is--

1527
01:42:26,100 --> 01:42:27,956
MATT: How much damage is that?

1528
01:42:27,956 --> 01:42:43,410
DAN: Let's see. That's like 40. Some shit. Okay,
12, 22, 27, 28 points of damage. Wait, plus three

1529
01:42:43,410 --> 01:42:46,224
more... 31!

1530
01:42:46,224 --> 01:42:52,082
MATT: 31! It had seven hit points. So, as you
vanish stealthily into the darkness of the swamp,

1531
01:42:52,082 --> 01:42:56,331
you can see the goblin that's currently harrying
the blackpowder merchant, Victor, looks over its

1532
01:42:56,331 --> 01:43:01,212
shoulder, "Huh?", as suddenly the blade protrudes
from its chest with such force that its ribcage

1533
01:43:01,212 --> 01:43:06,971
tears open, spraying the contents of its torso all
over the blackpowder merchant.

1534
01:43:06,971 --> 01:43:09,302
DAN: "Oh, you're in the splash zone!"

1535
01:43:09,302 --> 01:43:12,048
(laughter)

1536
01:43:12,048 --> 01:43:17,128
MATT: (coughing) "Good job!"

1537
01:43:17,128 --> 01:43:21,190
DAN: "Surprise! Here's Salty!"

1538
01:43:27,729 --> 01:43:30,040
MATT: Kurt, you're up.

1539
01:43:30,040 --> 01:43:32,231
LIAM: How do I top that?

1540
01:43:32,231 --> 01:43:33,881
DAN: Do I level up?

1541
01:43:33,881 --> 01:43:39,196
ORION: Yeah he did! He leveled up! He got to level
ten!

1542
01:43:39,196 --> 01:43:41,447
ZAC: Guys, we have a message!

1543
01:43:41,447 --> 01:43:47,124
CHAT ROOM: Bahamut, impressed with his bravery,
imbues a "XIX, the Sun" card to Stephen. He is now

1544
01:43:47,124 --> 01:43:49,143
a monk.

1545
01:43:50,046 --> 01:43:53,321
MARISHA: Wait, Stephen's now a monk?

1546
01:43:53,321 --> 01:43:59,903
MATT: As you look over to your child in this beam
of-- a silver-platinum light comes down from some

1547
01:43:59,903 --> 01:44:03,130
mystical source, you hear the flapping wings of a
dragon--

1548
01:44:03,130 --> 01:44:06,147
CHAT ROOM: Suddenly, in the middle of whatever is
happening, a beautiful and dangerous princess

1549
01:44:06,147 --> 01:44:11,175
appears in battle calling herself Ryco.
Snugglelord immediately falls madly in love with

1550
01:44:11,175 --> 01:44:14,065
her and proclaims to his go--

1551
01:44:14,065 --> 01:44:16,945
ZAC: Ryco, if you made that message...

1552
01:44:18,885 --> 01:44:20,117
MATT: You mean Ryan Copple?

1553
01:44:20,117 --> 01:44:21,399
ORION: Ryco is--

1554
01:44:21,399 --> 01:44:24,272
MATT: Oh, Ryco. Okay, well--

1555
01:44:25,925 --> 01:44:28,178
MARISHA: That's hilarious. I'm hoping so.

1556
01:44:28,178 --> 01:44:30,813
DAN: I'm level ten, you guys!

1557
01:44:30,813 --> 01:44:33,937
ZAC: So a princess named Ryco-- I have not got to
do anything--

1558
01:44:33,937 --> 01:44:38,849
MATT: And just then Ryco appears on the
battlefield, three-point landing, Avengers-style,

1559
01:44:39,134 --> 01:44:46,179
looks over and you can see now, this beaming
platinum light that's on your son, coming down, is

1560
01:44:46,179 --> 01:44:50,648
now coming from her as she holds aloft her holy
symbol. She looks down and goes, "Stephen, you

1561
01:44:50,648 --> 01:44:56,924
shall be the savior of this group", at which point
you see now his muscles pulse into him and now he

1562
01:44:56,924 --> 01:45:00,880
looks intensely ripped, as bracers now attach
themselves.

1563
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:03,250
MARISHA: Is he still seven?

1564
01:45:03,492 --> 01:45:07,560
MATT: He's still seven years old, but the
scariest-looking seven-year-old you've ever seen.

1565
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:12,001
DAN: "The sweet baby's got a six-pack on his
six-pack!"

1566
01:45:13,420 --> 01:45:18,698
MATT: All right, so Kurt. All this happens around
you, the princess winks at you,"Go! Fight,

1567
01:45:18,698 --> 01:45:21,271
once-Irishman!"

1568
01:45:21,271 --> 01:45:24,410
(laughter)

1569
01:45:24,410 --> 01:45:27,936
OFFSCREEN: Nobody has the thing up on their phone
or something? They're being cut off, some of

1570
01:45:27,936 --> 01:45:29,030
them.

1571
01:45:29,030 --> 01:45:33,202
ZAC: Some of them are getting cut off? I don't
have my phone on me. I can do that.

1572
01:45:33,202 --> 01:45:35,422
LIAM: Oh, jeebus. What enemies are left? I
don't--

1573
01:45:35,422 --> 01:45:38,129
MATT: There's one there and one here.

1574
01:45:38,129 --> 01:45:46,898
LIAM: All right. I'm running towards-- there's one
by Edna and Snugglelord? I'm running over. And I

1575
01:45:46,898 --> 01:45:49,131
yell-- and it's attacking Edna?

1576
01:45:49,131 --> 01:45:50,061
MATT: Yes.

1577
01:45:50,061 --> 01:45:52,054
LIAM: And I say, (irish accent): "Nobody--" Fuck!

1578
01:45:52,334 --> 01:45:58,484
(Brooklyn accent) Nobody touches my fucking girlfriend! 
Come here, you! And I take the hammer,

1579
01:45:58,484 --> 01:46:01,127
right in his head.

1580
01:46:01,127 --> 01:46:02,897
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll an attack.

1581
01:46:02,897 --> 01:46:06,546
MARISHA: "Oh, Kurt! Thank you so much, my sweetie
patootie!"

1582
01:46:06,546 --> 01:46:08,642
(laughter)

1583
01:46:08,642 --> 01:46:10,103
LIAM: That's a 19.

1584
01:46:10,103 --> 01:46:12,389
MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.

1585
01:46:14,341 --> 01:46:20,055
LIAM: Seven, nine, 11. Age is just a number, all
right?

1586
01:46:20,055 --> 01:46:23,522
MATT: As you rush over, you take the hammer and
smack it into the side of the goblin and it goes

1587
01:46:23,522 --> 01:46:29,169
just scattered into ash, and slowly drifts down
across the bottom of the swamp floor.

1588
01:46:29,169 --> 01:46:34,077
LIAM: And I take some of the blood off my weapon
and I smear it on Edna's face and say, now you are

1589
01:46:34,077 --> 01:46:36,304
a man.

1590
01:46:36,304 --> 01:46:44,238
MARISHA: What? I've got nice cans? Why thank you,
I know! You should've seen me when I was 20!

1591
01:46:44,238 --> 01:46:46,407
MATT: Edna, it's your turn.

1592
01:46:46,407 --> 01:46:49,521
MARISHA: What? Oh, it's my turn. Okay, am I still
surrounded by anything?

1593
01:46:49,521 --> 01:46:52,909
MATT: No, there's just one over here and one
goblin that looks hexed and is currently very

1594
01:46:52,909 --> 01:46:56,221
outmatched. The party is ever growing.

1595
01:46:56,221 --> 01:47:02,830
MARISHA: "Is that your son, Olaf, or is that a
goblin? Is that a gob-- Magic Missile!"

1596
01:47:02,830 --> 01:47:06,678
MATT: All right! Go ahead and roll Magic Missile
damage.

1597
01:47:08,898 --> 01:47:14,199
MARISHA: Two, five, ten!

1598
01:47:15,343 --> 01:47:18,634
MATT: The goblin, which now pulls out a second
arrow and is aiming it towards you. As it pulls

1599
01:47:18,634 --> 01:47:23,948
back, the three arrows go (swooshing) as each
burst of arcane energy slams one into its chest,

1600
01:47:23,948 --> 01:47:28,368
one into its shoulder, and the final one slams
under the chin, causing the front of its head to

1601
01:47:28,368 --> 01:47:32,842
explode out into a glimmering spray of crimson
into the night.

1602
01:47:33,811 --> 01:47:35,944
DAN: Christ!

1603
01:47:37,519 --> 01:47:41,268
MATT: The current threat disengaged, you all look
around at the chaos that just ensued and have to

1604
01:47:41,268 --> 01:47:45,902
take a moment to really digest what has
transpired, and with that we're going to take a

1605
01:47:45,902 --> 01:47:50,692
quick five-minute break! We'll be right back to
continue what the hell this is.

1606
01:47:50,692 --> 01:47:52,541
MARISHA: We got to level up Dan Casey!

1607
01:47:52,541 --> 01:47:55,270
DAN: I have 64,000 experience points!

1608
01:47:55,270 --> 01:47:57,777

1627
01:59:21,644 --> 01:59:26,680
MATT: Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to the
adventures of Vox Moronica and all the chaos that ensues.

1628
01:59:26,680 --> 01:59:33,427
ZAC: I have one quick message, guys. Because we
hit our goal, we've now raised it to 75,000, and we

1629
01:59:33,427 --> 01:59:39,254
have until the end of this game to raise it. Now,
don't forget, as you've probably witnessed, every

1630
01:59:39,254 --> 01:59:44,323
$500 donation, we've been reacting and doing the
crazy shit that you've been telling us to do.

1631
01:59:44,323 --> 01:59:54,048
DAN: I'm level ten now! Everything's on fire! A
child has a six-pack! You did this!

1632
01:59:54,048 --> 01:59:58,055
ZAC: And I'm about to, well--

1633
01:59:58,055 --> 01:59:59,991
MATT: All right, so here we go. So.

1634
01:59:59,991 --> 02:00:01,782
MARISHA: What level is Stephen, by the way?

1635
02:00:01,782 --> 02:00:05,475
MATT: Well, Stephen is now currently a level one
monk.

1636
02:00:05,475 --> 02:00:06,978
MARISHA: Level one monk, all right.

1637
02:00:06,978 --> 02:00:12,182
MATT: Which is still pretty good for a
seven-year-old, I'm just saying. So you guys, as

1638
02:00:12,182 --> 02:00:19,449
the battle winds down and the initial adrenaline
wears off, you can see Ryco, the princess that

1639
02:00:19,449 --> 02:00:25,562
landed in a three-point, stands up and looks over,
armor glimmering, beautiful face, long dark hair.

1640
02:00:25,562 --> 02:00:27,641
Glances about and gives everyone a look--

1641
02:00:27,641 --> 02:00:28,743
ZAC: Huge knockers.

1642
02:00:28,743 --> 02:00:36,967
MATT: Huge, enormous, and glances about the rest
of the party and goes, "You warriors have proven

1643
02:00:36,967 --> 02:00:43,042
"yourselves to delve into this dangerous night and
this swamp. Who do you call leader?"

1644
02:00:43,042 --> 02:00:47,116
ZAC: Me. This one.

1645
02:00:47,116 --> 02:00:49,814
MATT: She approaches you. "And what purpose do
you--"

1646
02:00:49,814 --> 02:00:54,389
CHAT ROOM: Gary the Badger comes to life as a
spirit animal and permanent companion of Liam's

1647
02:00:54,389 --> 02:01:00,875
character. Gary, feeling the deep hurt inside
Liam, restores his original accent. Liam can

1648
02:01:00,875 --> 02:01:02,693
change Gary change between.

1649
02:01:02,693 --> 02:01:04,452
MATT: So what was the top of that one?

1650
02:01:04,452 --> 02:01:11,088
ZAC: I think the computer volume needs to be
turned back up there, and I've got it right here.

1651
02:01:11,088 --> 02:01:17,053
"Gary the Badger comes to life as a spirit animal
and permanent companion of Liam's character. Gary,

will."

02:01:26,680 --> 02:01:27,937
DAN: Holy shit!

1655
02:01:27,937 --> 02:01:29,794
LIAM: The accent is back?

1656
02:01:29,794 --> 02:01:33,607
MATT: The accent is back. The badger, Gary,
reaches out to you and (animal sounds).

1657
02:01:33,607 --> 02:01:41,825
LIAM: So Kurt drops to his knees and openly starts
weeping and hugs the badger to him and says, I

1658
02:01:41,825 --> 02:01:51,521
lost Gary five years ago, and there's been a hole
inside me ever since! You, little man, you and I

1659
02:01:51,521 --> 02:01:55,637
are going to go places! And he's into my tattoo.

1660
02:01:55,637 --> 02:01:58,583
DAN: That's freaky as shit!

1661
02:01:58,583 --> 02:02:00,486
ORION: I turn out of bear form.

1662
02:02:00,486 --> 02:02:01,523
MATT: Okay.

1663
02:02:01,523 --> 02:02:07,889
CHAT ROOM: Salty Pete suddenly sees his lost
fingers magically reappear. As he attempts to feel

1664
02:02:07,889 --> 02:02:13,187
them, the illusion fades and the fingers
disappear. He hears the demon's cackling laughter

1665
02:02:13,187 --> 02:02:15,085
in the darkness.

1666
02:02:15,085 --> 02:02:23,902
DAN: Why! Why would you take my fingers, then
bring them back, and then cackle at my loss?! Oh

1667
02:02:23,902 --> 02:02:31,254
no, my long-lost digits! I thought they were a
necklace, but no! They're a cruel fallacy!

1668
02:02:31,254 --> 02:02:35,330
MATT: As the illusion of the fingers fades, you hear
in the distance, echoing in the dark forest,

1669
02:02:35,330 --> 02:02:44,627
(cackling). You sense some very dark evil is very,
very near.

1670
02:02:44,627 --> 02:02:47,036
DAN: Oh, thank goodness I'm level ten.

1671
02:02:47,036 --> 02:02:54,743
MATT: At which point, Ryco has now approached the
de facto leader of the group and says, "Your name?"

1672
02:02:54,743 --> 02:02:59,478
ZAC: I'm Snugglelord.

1673
02:02:59,478 --> 02:03:01,939
MATT: "And your purpose in this swamp?"

1674
02:03:01,939 --> 02:03:05,221
ZAC: To take your hand in marriage.

1675
02:03:05,221 --> 02:03:06,882
MATT: Pardon me?

1676
02:03:06,882 --> 02:03:17,482
ZAC: I get down on one knee and I look at Ryco
right in the eyes, and I say, you're awesome and

1677
02:03:17,482 --> 02:03:23,224
amazing at everything. Will you be my
big-knockered wife?

1678
02:03:23,224 --> 02:03:26,196
MATT: Roll persuasion with advantage.

1679
02:03:26,196 --> 02:03:28,256
LIAM: That's fucking beautiful.

1680
02:03:28,256 --> 02:03:33,434
MATT: As the rays of moonlight come streaking
through the tops of the forest, this crystalline,

1681
02:03:33,434 --> 02:03:39,696
beautiful moment-- You roll twice; you take the
higher. Frames the two of them, this male and

1682
02:03:39,696 --> 02:03:41,868
female form, masculine--

1683
02:03:41,868 --> 02:03:46,442
CHAT ROOM: Crazy merchant man and Stephen both
shout, Look these! This burning red, an explosion

1684
02:03:46,442 --> 02:03:52,375
the size of a nuke goes off in the distance. (two
tracks playing over each other) feel of change

1685
02:03:52,375 --> 02:03:53,875
over why.

1686
02:03:53,875 --> 02:03:55,311
ZAC: I'm going to load those up.

1687
02:03:55,311 --> 02:03:59,911
MATT: Load those up. We still have a couple
messages to get to, guys.

1688
02:03:59,911 --> 02:04:01,845
ZAC: That was a 17.

1689
02:04:01,845 --> 02:04:10,200
MATT: Ryco glanced down at you, and you can see
this red flush in her cheeks. She goes, "Well,

1690
02:04:10,200 --> 02:04:17,810
"you, warrior, you shall be my champion. I accept
your hand."

1691
02:04:17,810 --> 02:04:19,956
IFY: Yeah, she accepted, but it was more than 17.

1692
02:04:19,956 --> 02:04:25,918
ZAC: I'm sorry. It was a 23 or something like
that. I was underselling it.

1693
02:04:25,918 --> 02:04:31,441
MATT: Nevertheless, she takes your hand and pulls
you up and, while you yourself are caught in her

1694
02:04:31,441 --> 02:04:35,730
eyes, she, in a very forceful warrior self,
reaches out, takes you by the hand, and Frenches

1695
02:04:35,730 --> 02:04:39,408
you deeply in the center of the swamp.

1696
02:04:39,408 --> 02:04:40,956
(whooping)

1697
02:04:40,956 --> 02:04:44,118
IFY: I cover up Stephen's eyes.

1698
02:04:44,118 --> 02:04:46,389
ORION: From that?

1699
02:04:46,389 --> 02:04:49,593
LIAM: Is Frenching you in the swamp a euphemism?

1700
02:04:49,593 --> 02:04:50,592
MATT: It is now.

1701
02:04:50,592 --> 02:04:52,261
DAN: Don't look it up on Urban Dictionary!

1702
02:04:52,261 --> 02:04:59,007
ZAC: I pull back and say, sorry, sorry, that's
actually just a unicorn. It's not what you think.

1703
02:04:59,007 --> 02:05:01,509
It's literally a unicorn. I'm sorry.

1704
02:05:01,509 --> 02:05:05,117
MATT: She looks disappointed, then smiles and
goes, "Well, I entrust you are here for worthy

1705
02:05:05,117 --> 02:05:12,403
"reasons. Now, as my future husband, I wish you all
health, and I gift you this." And her fingers go

1706
02:05:12,403 --> 02:05:17,362
out, and with a magical array, this strange
leather girdle appears and hovers in the air.

1707
02:05:17,362 --> 02:05:26,982
"This will give magical power to whoever should
wear it, and a gift of switching their sex to the

1708
02:05:26,982 --> 02:05:31,877
"other side to gain a new, beautiful perspective on
life. Who would take this boon?"

1709
02:05:31,877 --> 02:05:34,810
ZAC: Guys, my Ryco's into some freaky shit.

1710
02:05:34,810 --> 02:05:41,818
DAN: I feel like we all want that. I feel like all
of us really want it. All of us.

1711
02:05:41,818 --> 02:05:47,459
ZAC: I mean, you could give it to your husband if
you ever wanted, per se, a wife as well.

1712
02:05:47,459 --> 02:05:55,082
IFY: I think it should go to me and my buff-ass
son. I mean, we got a lot of stuff to work out.

1713
02:05:55,082 --> 02:05:57,776
ZAC: I would say it would be quite nice for your son to
have a mother as well.

1714
02:05:57,776 --> 02:06:05,048
IFY: You don't know. I need to play two roles. He
don't have a mom anymore. I need to be the daddy

1715
02:06:05,048 --> 02:06:06,210
and the mama.

1716
02:06:06,210 --> 02:06:10,491
DAN: I'm clearly the strongest one here. I need
the strength that comes with being a woman.

1717
02:06:10,491 --> 02:06:11,841
MARISHA: What?

1718
02:06:11,841 --> 02:06:13,562
ORION: I mean, by all means.

1719
02:06:13,562 --> 02:06:18,096
MATT: I would like the entire party to roll a
persuasion check. Whoever rolls highest--

1720
02:06:18,096 --> 02:06:23,220
MARISHA: I take seniority shit around here! I'm
old! Oh, I have an 18!

1721
02:06:23,220 --> 02:06:25,176
LIAM: I'm petting Gary under a tree and watching
all this.

1722
02:06:25,176 --> 02:06:28,037
MARISHA: What was it? Persuasion? 20 total.

1723
02:06:28,037 --> 02:06:29,075
ORION: Two.

1724
02:06:29,075 --> 02:06:30,823
ZAC: 17.

1725
02:06:30,823 --> 02:06:32,916
DAN: Six.

1726
02:06:32,916 --> 02:06:34,154
IFY: Five.

1727
02:06:34,154 --> 02:06:39,440
MARISHA: Look, you see, I've been around for quite
some time, and I have had to live under the

1728
02:06:39,440 --> 02:06:45,990
patriarchal values of this kingdom, and you know
what? It's really tough being a woman. I had to

1729
02:06:45,990 --> 02:06:50,223
birth two big, strong boys out of me.

1730
02:06:50,223 --> 02:06:52,510
ORION: From your vagina?

1731
02:06:52,510 --> 02:07:00,216
MARISHA: And you know what? My good late Charles
husband, God rest his soul, he was a good husband,

1732
02:07:00,216 --> 02:07:01,616
but he--

1733
02:07:01,616 --> 02:07:03,706
ORION: They always used to say, Charles would
charge.

1734
02:07:03,706 --> 02:07:04,705
MARISHA: What?

1735
02:07:04,705 --> 02:07:08,324
MATT: Ryco does this with her fingers, and the
girdle drifts toward you and goes, "It is your

1736
02:07:08,324 --> 02:07:14,913
"choice, then. You decide who takes the girdle." At
which point, she looks over to Snugglelord, winks,

1737
02:07:14,913 --> 02:07:17,044
and then vanishes in a puff of smoke.

1738
02:07:17,044 --> 02:07:19,699
DAN: Bye! Bye, Ryco!

1739
02:07:19,699 --> 02:07:23,600
IFY: It's all right. Sometimes we've got to be
nice to Grandma, okay?

1740
02:07:23,600 --> 02:07:26,519
DAN: Yep, well, sure. She'll be Grandpa.

1741
02:07:26,519 --> 02:07:29,120
ORION: Are you going to try it on? Does it make
you younger?

1742
02:07:29,120 --> 02:07:32,310
MARISHA: Yes. I don't think so. I think it just
makes me Ed.

1743
02:07:32,310 --> 02:07:38,667
ORION: So it will make you a gross old man with
low-hanging balls. That's not good.

1744
02:07:38,667 --> 02:07:41,958
MATT: So you take the girdle. Do you put it on?

1745
02:07:41,958 --> 02:07:43,603
MARISHA: Yes, I do.

1746
02:07:43,603 --> 02:07:48,955
MATT: All right. As she puts the girdle on, you
can see her older, elderly woman form shimmers and

1747
02:07:48,955 --> 02:07:56,770
shifts into instead an elderly, hunched-over man
with a hook nose and a cleft chin.

1748
02:07:56,770 --> 02:07:58,939
MARISHA: What do I look like? Am I handsome?

1749
02:07:58,939 --> 02:08:00,969
ORION: It looks like your name is Ed, now.

1750
02:08:00,969 --> 02:08:08,498
MATT: At which point, Stephen, the monk kid, and
the old blackpowder merchant, both together

1751
02:08:08,498 --> 02:08:15,312
shout-- which I can't shout together because I'm
one human being-- "Look! An explosion!" "Look! An

1752
02:08:15,312 --> 02:08:21,659
"explosion!" And you guys look off in the distance
and see this bright red glow as an almost

1753
02:08:21,659 --> 02:08:25,672
nuclear-sized red burst comes coasting through the
trees.

1754
02:08:25,672 --> 02:08:27,223
ORION: I hang onto the chain-link fence.

1755
02:08:27,223 --> 02:08:31,529
ZAC: I grab the merchant, and I put him in front
of me and hold him.

1756
02:08:31,529 --> 02:08:34,763
IFY: I grab and protect my buff-ass son.

1757
02:08:34,763 --> 02:08:36,761
DAN: I clench my body.

1758
02:08:36,761 --> 02:08:43,098
LIAM: I grab Ed and say, it doesn't mean a thing,
baby! And I kiss him.

1759
02:08:43,098 --> 02:08:45,251
ORION: I look at playground.

1760
02:08:45,251 --> 02:08:49,672
MARISHA: It's 2015! We can be progressive, god
damn it!

1761
02:08:49,672 --> 02:08:55,515
MATT: As the blast wave comes coursing through the
swamp, expecting to be turned to dust, instead a

1762
02:08:55,515 --> 02:09:04,326
wave of warmth drifts over you. You open your
eyes, releasing the tension, and you and you and

1763
02:09:04,326 --> 02:09:07,296
you and you are all women.

1764
02:09:07,296 --> 02:09:08,893
ZAC: I have boobs!

1765
02:09:08,893 --> 02:09:10,539
DAN: I'm Salty Pietra!

1766
02:09:10,539 --> 02:09:11,960
ZAC: I have boobs!

1767
02:09:11,960 --> 02:09:13,901
MATT: You turn back to Edna.

1768
02:09:13,901 --> 02:09:17,179
DAN: At least you have the girdle!

1769
02:09:17,179 --> 02:09:19,978
ZAC: I have boobs!

1770
02:09:19,978 --> 02:09:26,434
MARISHA: I didn't even get to see what my member
looked like! That's really unfortunate!

1771
02:09:26,434 --> 02:09:28,022
ZAC: Oh, I should look fast.

1772
02:09:28,022 --> 02:09:30,920
DAN: Now it's an innie again!

1773
02:09:30,920 --> 02:09:38,287
IFY: That don't mean a thing, baby! That's Ulfgar
Fireforge, ex-pit fighter, ex-bin, sellsword;

1774
02:09:38,287 --> 02:09:43,984
bullshit talks, money walks; I got a son now; his
name is Stephen--

1775
02:09:43,984 --> 02:09:50,641
MATT: "No, it's now Stephanie!" As you now seem to
have a monk daughter who all of a sudden, the

1776
02:09:50,641 --> 02:09:57,014
muscles rip even heavier as she all of a sudden
ascends to level ten to match Salty Pete.

1777
02:09:57,014 --> 02:09:58,967
DAN: Finally! Someone on my level!

1778
02:09:58,967 --> 02:10:01,122
MARISHA: What? Why? Just because?

1779
02:10:01,122 --> 02:10:08,236
MATT: Because the deity Shathrum demanded that
this blast of energy also instill the heroic

1780
02:10:08,236 --> 02:10:13,982
presence within this child, who ages four years
into the future. At the tender age of 11, this

1781
02:10:13,982 --> 02:10:23,391
daughter, now strong, Korra-style, glances up at
her mother and goes, "Now I can protect you, Mom!"

1782
02:10:23,391 --> 02:10:26,485
IFY: That's my baby. Aw.

1783
02:10:26,485 --> 02:10:30,067
ORION: I don't know about you, but I'm quite happy
with the results.

1784
02:10:30,067 --> 02:10:32,093
ZAC: I have boobs!

1785
02:10:32,093 --> 02:10:35,779
LIAM: Kurt holds her bosom and says, my tattoo's
now three-dimensional!

1786
02:10:35,779 --> 02:10:39,623
DAN: It's like a relief map!

1787
02:10:39,623 --> 02:10:46,097
MARISHA: I just want you to know, Kurt, that this
doesn't change anything. You were open-minded when

1788
02:10:46,097 --> 02:10:47,903
I was a man, and now--

1789
02:10:47,903 --> 02:10:49,395
MATT: Everyone roll a perception check.

1790
02:10:49,395 --> 02:10:50,698
LIAM: Feel these! They're fantastic!

1791
02:10:50,698 --> 02:10:52,517
MARISHA: Okay. Ooh!

1792
02:10:52,517 --> 02:10:55,727
LIAM: Roll a what? What's going on?

1793
02:10:55,727 --> 02:11:03,925
MATT: Roll a perception check, for the love of
God! Roll a perception check! All of you!

1794
02:11:03,925 --> 02:11:05,857
IFY: I rolled a one.

1795
02:11:05,857 --> 02:11:07,131
MARISHA: 25.

1796
02:11:07,131 --> 02:11:08,286
IFY: A one.

1797
02:11:08,286 --> 02:11:09,789
DAN: 15!

1798
02:11:09,789 --> 02:11:11,664
ZAC: 24.

1799
02:11:11,664 --> 02:11:15,204
MATT: Both Quaaludia--

1800
02:11:15,204 --> 02:11:16,713
ORION: You can call me Q.

1801
02:11:16,713 --> 02:11:22,829
MATT: Q and Edna glance off, and you see in the
distance this large mound of swamp earth that

1802
02:11:22,829 --> 02:11:27,606
seems to be similar to what the alchemist had told
you to go ahead and locate, where apparently this

1803
02:11:27,606 --> 02:11:29,532
doorway had been opened.

1804
02:11:29,532 --> 02:11:32,347
ORION: I go over to investigate. You want to come
in?

1805
02:11:32,347 --> 02:11:36,516
MARISHA: Ah, yes. I think we were standing next to
what we were looking for the whole time.

1806
02:11:36,516 --> 02:11:38,341
ORION: Is something wrong with your ear?

1807
02:11:38,341 --> 02:11:42,879
MARISHA: I don't know. I was talking to you via
comms, I don't know why.

1808
02:11:42,879 --> 02:11:53,592
ORION: What is a comm? You so crazy, girl. I love
you. Let's go investigate, yes? I walk over. I see

1809
02:11:53,592 --> 02:11:54,774
what is going on.

1810
02:11:54,774 --> 02:11:58,349
LIAM: I take the war pick off my back, and I start
walking toward the mound.

1811
02:11:58,349 --> 02:12:02,236
MATT: All right. Making your way deeper into the
Zola Swamp toward this mound, you begin to recall,

1812
02:12:02,236 --> 02:12:08,634
you've heard mysteries about this Zola Swamp, and
you've heard such things as rampant curses. The

1813
02:12:08,634 --> 02:12:13,552
magical energies here are so strong and cross over
so with many realms that chaos seems to burst out

1814
02:12:13,552 --> 02:12:18,077
at periods of time, and you feel like this entire
group has fallen into a nexus period in which the

1815
02:12:18,077 --> 02:12:22,897
magical energies uncontrollably alter the
landscape around, thus the events that have

1816
02:12:22,897 --> 02:12:24,664
transpired in the recent time.

1817
02:12:24,664 --> 02:12:26,386
MARISHA: This explains why it's been a very weird
day.

1818
02:12:26,386 --> 02:12:28,370
DAN: There's got to be a rational explanation.

1819
02:12:28,370 --> 02:12:32,327
MATT: As you make your way toward this earthy
mound, you look about the outside and you can see

1820
02:12:32,327 --> 02:12:38,649
there are a series of animal limbs and strange,
crudely carved runes and various skulls that are

1821
02:12:38,649 --> 02:12:42,381
all hanging by pieces of twine all around the
outside of this entranceway that seems to delve

1822
02:12:42,381 --> 02:12:47,510
into a deep, animalistically carved natural tunnel
into the swamp floor proper.

1823
02:12:47,510 --> 02:12:52,520
ORION: I want to do an insight check.

1824
02:12:52,520 --> 02:12:53,869
MATT: Onto?

1825
02:12:53,869 --> 02:12:56,994
ORION: To see if I recognize any of the carvings
or any of that stuff.

1826
02:12:56,994 --> 02:13:02,521
MATT: It wouldn't be insight, per se. Insight's
more of a person's motives. You can go ahead and

1827
02:13:02,521 --> 02:13:03,811
roll a religion check.

1828
02:13:03,811 --> 02:13:07,326
ORION: Okay. That's 14.

1829
02:13:07,326 --> 02:13:08,756
MATT: Okay.

1830
02:13:08,756 --> 02:13:10,511
IFY: Can I roll a perception check?

1831
02:13:10,511 --> 02:13:12,312
MATT: What are you looking for?

1832
02:13:12,312 --> 02:13:13,662
IFY: My vagina.

1833
02:13:13,662 --> 02:13:15,288
(laughter)

1834
02:13:15,288 --> 02:13:17,950
ORION: I guess we should explore ourselves.

1835
02:13:17,950 --> 02:13:21,083
IFY: That is a nine.

1836
02:13:21,083 --> 02:13:23,591
MATT: Nine? You're going to be busy for a while.

1837
02:13:23,591 --> 02:13:25,150
DAN: Take 20!

1838
02:13:25,150 --> 02:13:28,197
MATT: All right, so. Glancing about--

1839
02:13:28,197 --> 02:13:29,805
ZAC: When you find it, it's glorious.

1840
02:13:29,805 --> 02:13:33,499
MATT: --the rooms, as you look across them, the
carvings, there are these strange, ancient

1841
02:13:33,499 --> 02:13:40,752
symbols. You can see what looks almost like a G
and an S. These are symbols of the great, ancient

1842
02:13:40,752 --> 02:13:42,479
deity, Shathrum.

1843
02:13:42,479 --> 02:13:49,843
ORION: I recognize these things, eh, Snugglefoots?
Come over here and look. It seems like there is

1844
02:13:49,843 --> 02:13:53,292
some kind of G and S.

1845
02:13:53,292 --> 02:13:58,462
ZAC: It's the Shathrum! Shathrum! Our god!

1846
02:13:58,462 --> 02:14:00,747
DAN: Ah, <i>your</i> god.

1847
02:14:00,747 --> 02:14:04,249
ZAC: There's only one god!

1848
02:14:04,249 --> 02:14:10,818
IFY: Excuse me, did you not see that dragon come
out and make my daughter buff? Did you not see

1849
02:14:10,818 --> 02:14:14,888
that dragon come out and make my daughter buff?
Did you not see the dragon in the sky?

1850
02:14:14,888 --> 02:14:16,355
ZAC: That was God, the Shathrum!

1851
02:14:16,355 --> 02:14:17,780
IFY: No, that was Bahamut.

1852
02:14:17,780 --> 02:14:22,708
DAN: Then how do you explain the demon that took
away my fingers, then made them come back, then

1853
02:14:22,708 --> 02:14:23,975
took them away?

1854
02:14:23,975 --> 02:14:26,485
ZAC: It's the sick sense of humor of the
Shathrum!

1855
02:14:26,485 --> 02:14:29,816
ORION: Can I feel it? Is it open?

1856
02:14:29,816 --> 02:14:34,337
MATT: Yeah. It is an open tunnel that leads deeper
into the earth itself.

1857
02:14:34,337 --> 02:14:38,036
ZAC: We have to go! We have to! This is my
calling!

1858
02:14:38,036 --> 02:14:39,670
DAN: Let's do it!

1859
02:14:39,670 --> 02:14:46,910
ZAC: I was expecting resistance, but you want
to--? Okay, fine. I just thought you would be

1860
02:14:46,910 --> 02:14:48,051
against me on this.

1861
02:14:48,051 --> 02:14:49,661
DAN: It was a run-by fruiting.

1862
02:14:49,661 --> 02:14:54,518
MATT: The feminine bravery that seems to have
taken root in Salty Pete, you can see the

1863
02:14:54,518 --> 02:15:00,395
confidence of a modern-day woman taking over what
was once a relatively questioning male, leads the

1864
02:15:00,395 --> 02:15:05,518
charge deeper into the swamp earth before you. The
tunnel, dark and moldy from the interior, the cold

1865
02:15:05,518 --> 02:15:10,457
air hitting you-- you can smell mildew and rot and
what sounds like wood that has largely fallen into

1866
02:15:10,457 --> 02:15:18,287
dusty awfulness. Descending further into the
cavern, you hear in the distance low muttering,

1867
02:15:18,287 --> 02:15:29,895
this small, synchronized, cacophonous chant, this
(whispered incantations) echoing maybe, you'd

1868
02:15:29,895 --> 02:15:34,226
imagine, 20, 30 feet ahead of you, around a bend.
You can see a little bit of flickering light

1869
02:15:34,226 --> 02:15:37,226
that's pushing into the hallway from around that
turn.

1870
02:15:37,226 --> 02:15:46,902
ORION: When I hear that, I'm going to use my Mask
of the Wild, and I'm going to blend into the side

1871
02:15:46,902 --> 02:15:48,161
of the rock.

1872
02:15:48,161 --> 02:15:53,057
MATT: Okay. As you shimmer to the side of the
rock, go ahead and roll a stealth roll with advantage.

1873
02:15:53,057 --> 02:15:59,317
ORION: Yeah, that'll work. That's a 19.

1874
02:15:59,317 --> 02:16:06,232
MATT: 19? Okay. You crest around the edge. You
enter an actual chamber at the end of this

1875
02:16:06,232 --> 02:16:10,859
hallway, closed off, and there's a couple of small
rocks in the center. But in the middle of this,

1876
02:16:10,859 --> 02:16:17,012
you see a large bonfire. An orangish-blue flame is
flickering and burning. You can see stones

1877
02:16:17,012 --> 02:16:23,148
arranged almost like a haphazard, half-fallen
doorway. You can see what appears to be four

1878
02:16:23,148 --> 02:16:27,017
goblins around, one of which is larger than the
others with all this war paint across its face,

1879
02:16:27,017 --> 02:16:32,374
and they're all chanting in unison. (chanting)

1880
02:16:32,374 --> 02:16:35,248
MARISHA: I go ahead and cast Mage Armor on
myself.

1881
02:16:35,248 --> 02:16:38,220
MATT: All right, you have Mage Armor on yourself.
You can see though, the lead goblin is throwing

1882
02:16:38,220 --> 02:16:43,090
things into the flame. With each toss, the flames
flicker up into vibrant blue flames and then die

1883
02:16:43,090 --> 02:16:48,854
back down, the color turning more and more from a
blue to a bright, vibrant yellow. It's pulsing

1884
02:16:48,854 --> 02:16:50,313
now. The fire's pulsing.

1885
02:16:50,313 --> 02:16:51,956
DAN: I'd like to stealth.

1886
02:16:51,956 --> 02:16:54,882
MATT: Roll stealth, Salty Petunia.

1887
02:16:54,882 --> 02:16:58,320
DAN: All right, that is a 30.

1888
02:16:58,320 --> 02:16:59,655
MATT: Okay!

1889
02:16:59,655 --> 02:17:00,887
DAN: I'm level ten!

1890
02:17:00,887 --> 02:17:08,156
MATT: All right. So as you come around the bend
too, you see the druid, which is currently hidden

1891
02:17:08,156 --> 02:17:12,973
across the rock. You also have the same view, and
you can see the danger at this. Suddenly, as

1892
02:17:12,973 --> 02:17:20,021
you're watching, you see the flames flicker in,
and the goblins all stand up, and a tendril spikes

1893
02:17:20,021 --> 02:17:25,036
out of the flames. This small purple door seems to
open up, and a tentacle reaches out and wraps

1894
02:17:25,036 --> 02:17:31,022
around a goblin and pulls it in. It screams. All
the goblins keep chanting, keep chanting. It opens

1895
02:17:31,022 --> 02:17:35,968
up even further and further, and from what you can
see now, this entity starts pulling through. It's

1896
02:17:35,968 --> 02:17:43,671
this weird, fleshy mass, almost like this
amorphous, giant cluster of flesh that is

1897
02:17:43,671 --> 02:17:49,197
surrounded with teeth and eyes, eyes that glance
around in all positions, mouths that open up and

1898
02:17:49,197 --> 02:17:53,762
screech and squeal, and then disappear. It's
constantly moving and shifting in its position,

1899
02:17:53,762 --> 02:17:59,248
and as it comes out, this weird, twisting
cacophony of voices of all different shrieking

1900
02:17:59,248 --> 02:18:06,134
sounds and low guttural murmurs all happening at
once, (eldritch noises). The goblins smile and

1901
02:18:06,134 --> 02:18:09,224
look more and more feverish as suddenly it reaches
out and grabs another one, stuffing it into its

1902
02:18:09,224 --> 02:18:14,794
maw, until eventually only the lead goblin
remains. As he stands there, chanting and chanting

1903
02:18:14,794 --> 02:18:19,984
and chanting, the creature moves forward and
slowly envelops and rolls over the goblin. You

1904
02:18:19,984 --> 02:18:25,703
hear this scream as its body is completely
consumed. As it pulls back, you can see almost the

1905
02:18:25,703 --> 02:18:30,531
goblin's face appear as part of its fleshy mass
for a second and then vanish into it. You also see

1906
02:18:30,531 --> 02:18:36,587
a partially absorbed human arm and half of a face
that matches the description of the assistant,

1907
02:18:36,587 --> 02:18:39,003
Cyril, that you were coming to find.

1908
02:18:39,003 --> 02:18:42,707
DAN: It's Ulfgar's vagina! We found it!

1909
02:18:42,707 --> 02:18:45,438
IFY: Real funny, guys. You guys are real funny.

1910
02:18:45,438 --> 02:18:52,784
ZAC: I take my imp off my shoulder, and I say,
Lucas! Stand five feet in front of me! And then I

1911
02:18:52,784 --> 02:19:01,780
use Crown of Madness, and I attach it to the
merchant, my "son", and make him also stand five

1912
02:19:01,780 --> 02:19:07,790
feet in front of me, creating a human shield--
well, not human, but a shield, a body shield, what

1913
02:19:07,790 --> 02:19:10,443
children are for. They're ready to soak up that
damage.

1914
02:19:10,443 --> 02:19:14,913
DAN: How big is this entity, again? How gigantic?

1915
02:19:14,913 --> 02:19:17,122
MATT: There it is.

1916
02:19:17,122 --> 02:19:20,601
DAN: (nervous laughter) Not great.

1917
02:19:20,601 --> 02:19:25,527
MATT: So I would ask all of you to roll
initiative, please.

1918
02:19:25,527 --> 02:19:34,812
ORION: Matthew? As position goes, I'm right
there.

1919
02:19:34,812 --> 02:19:36,158
MATT: You're off to the side?

1920
02:19:36,158 --> 02:19:42,131
ORION: Up against there, and yeah. And my Mask of
the Wild, I look like the wall. That's what it does.

1921
02:19:42,131 --> 02:19:44,299
MATT: Yes, I'm aware.

1922
02:19:44,299 --> 02:19:46,981
DAN: Am I still stealthed for this, or did I--?

1923
02:19:46,981 --> 02:19:49,506
MATT: You are still stealthed, currently, as far
as you know.

1924
02:19:49,506 --> 02:19:51,594
DAN: I'll find out real quick.

1925
02:19:51,594 --> 02:19:59,553
MATT: Yes, you will. All right. So initiative
rolls, everyone? We have 25 to 20?

1926
02:19:59,553 --> 02:20:00,878
LIAM: 20.

1927
02:20:00,878 --> 02:20:06,365
MATT: 20, all right. All right.

1928
02:20:06,365 --> 02:20:09,809
ZAC: 18.

1929
02:20:09,809 --> 02:20:16,759
MATT: 18 for Snuggs over there. 20 to 15, 15 to
ten?

1930
02:20:16,759 --> 02:20:17,872
ORION: 13.

1931
02:20:17,872 --> 02:20:20,139
DAN: I also have a 13.

1932
02:20:20,139 --> 02:20:26,780
MATT: All righty. Salty. Ten to five? Five to
one?

1933
02:20:26,780 --> 02:20:28,881
IFY: One!

1934
02:20:28,881 --> 02:20:33,561
ZAC: Still looking for that vagina, eh?

1935
02:20:33,561 --> 02:20:37,752
IFY: I'm having fun here.

1936
02:20:37,752 --> 02:20:43,023
MATT: So top. Kurt, you're actually up first, and
you are back here with the rest of the group in

1937
02:20:43,023 --> 02:20:44,239
this circumstance.

1938
02:20:44,239 --> 02:20:45,480
MARISHA: Go get them, tiger!

1939
02:20:45,480 --> 02:20:53,523
LIAM: Right. Well, obviously I would like to
fucking rage! And I push my beautiful mane of hair

1940
02:20:53,523 --> 02:21:03,223
back and slap my-- oh, fucking hell, that hurts.
Let's do this, Gary! And Gary the badger flies out

1941
02:21:03,223 --> 02:21:06,677
of my breast and lands in front of me, ready to
fight by my side.

1942
02:21:06,677 --> 02:21:08,406
ZAC: You have boobs now!

1943
02:21:08,406 --> 02:21:12,580
LIAM: And I pull up one of my hammers and flip it
in my hand, and as soon as I catch it, I throw it

1944
02:21:12,580 --> 02:21:14,243
at the fucking thing.

1945
02:21:14,243 --> 02:21:17,697
MATT: All right, so as you move forward to get
within visual range of it, moving past your

1946
02:21:17,697 --> 02:21:22,203
allies, Gary appears right in front of you. This
dice will be your Gary badger. And you can go

1947
02:21:22,203 --> 02:21:27,901
ahead and throw the hammer at the entity. It is
with disadvantage because of the distance it is

1948
02:21:27,901 --> 02:21:29,729
from you right now. So go for it.

1949
02:21:29,729 --> 02:21:34,243
LIAM: Oh, that's terrible. Oh, terrible, terrible.
It flies right by.

1950
02:21:34,243 --> 02:21:39,827
MATT: It does. It actually lands over here. Your
hammer ends up slamming and streaking across,

1951
02:21:39,827 --> 02:21:44,310
hitting this piece of stone, and then arcing off
to the side. So is that a regular hammer or the

1952
02:21:44,310 --> 02:21:45,444
magical one?

1953
02:21:45,444 --> 02:21:49,754
LIAM: That was a regular one. I'm just fucking
glad I'm Irish again.

1954
02:21:49,754 --> 02:21:55,682
MATT: All right, that's your turn. Next, this
creature comes streaming forth

1955
02:21:55,682 --> 02:22:04,071
(eldritch chanting). Okay. As it moves forward, the ground
you can see around it, the actual stone floor,

1956
02:22:04,071 --> 02:22:10,787
begins to almost warp and bend like it doesn't
have, in its near vicinity, the same hard

1957
02:22:10,787 --> 02:22:19,233
physicality as it did before. All righty. So first
it's going to go ahead and start-- it's going to

1958
02:22:19,233 --> 02:22:25,260
go ahead and reach out with one of its tendrils
towards you. It has a bunch of these biting mouths

1959
02:22:25,260 --> 02:22:27,515
on it. Whips out toward you.

1960
02:22:27,515 --> 02:22:29,002
LIAM: Is it a dex save?

1961
02:22:29,002 --> 02:22:32,338
MATT: No, this is a 20 to hit.

1962
02:22:32,338 --> 02:22:33,898
LIAM: Oh, that hits.

1963
02:22:33,898 --> 02:22:43,162
MATT: It will actually move right up to there,
that side there. So it hits. You take 17 points of

1964
02:22:43,162 --> 02:22:44,488
piercing damage.

1965
02:22:44,488 --> 02:22:46,880
LIAM: That's rough.

1966
02:22:46,880 --> 02:22:48,096
MATT: Yes.

1967
02:22:48,096 --> 02:22:49,574
DAN: We're proper fucked!

1968
02:22:49,574 --> 02:22:52,589
MATT: And make a strength saving throw.

1969
02:22:52,589 --> 02:23:00,284
LIAM: Strength saving throw. I get advantage on
that, so that's a 15.

1970
02:23:00,284 --> 02:23:05,760
MATT: 15. The impact of it pushes you back and you
almost fall over, but you catch yourself and throw

1971
02:23:05,760 --> 02:23:14,351
the tendril off your body and angrily growl at it
in response. That ends its turn. Snuggle, you're

1972
02:23:14,351 --> 02:23:18,341
up. At the top of your-- okay, yeah, you're far
enough away. Okay.

1973
02:23:18,341 --> 02:23:20,080
ZAC: I'm still Snugglelord, mind you.

1974
02:23:20,080 --> 02:23:22,893
MATT: Sorry. Snugglelord. My apologies.

1975
02:23:22,893 --> 02:23:25,389
ZAC: My penis may have left me, but the name
sticks.

1976
02:23:25,389 --> 02:23:28,162
MATT: True. Snugglelady.

1977
02:23:28,162 --> 02:23:42,510
ZAC: So I control the merchant, and I have him run
directly at the creature, yelling like a fricking

1978
02:23:42,510 --> 02:23:46,205
idiot, saying, "Please kill me! Please kill me!
Please kill me!"

1979
02:23:46,205 --> 02:23:53,498
MATT: "Please kill me! Please kill me! Kill me!"
Running towards it. Is that all you wanted to do?

1980
02:23:53,498 --> 02:23:56,152
ORION: He has to make a melee attack.

1981
02:23:56,152 --> 02:23:58,619
ZAC: Is this Crown of Madness guy?

1982
02:23:58,619 --> 02:24:00,471
MATT: Yeah. It has to make an attack at the end of
it.

1983
02:24:00,471 --> 02:24:01,925
ZAC: Oh, he has to attack?

1984
02:24:01,925 --> 02:24:03,321
DAN: He gets to.

1985
02:24:03,321 --> 02:24:04,769
ORION: If you make him do something--

1986
02:24:04,769 --> 02:24:14,360
MATT: Go ahead and roll the attack for it. What'd
you roll?

1987
02:24:14,360 --> 02:24:15,721
ZAC: A four.

1988
02:24:15,721 --> 02:24:23,201
MATT: A four? This creature should be easy to hit.
It is large, and it's not moving very fast, but

1989
02:24:23,201 --> 02:24:29,713
the blackpowder merchant has bags of this dark
powder attached to it that it carries with it, and

1990
02:24:29,713 --> 02:24:35,759
runs forward and starts trying to punch at it, and
it's like hitting dough (impacts). No damage

1991
02:24:35,759 --> 02:24:42,065
whatsoever. But it seems to have gotten its
attention to some degree. So that's the end of

1992
02:24:42,065 --> 02:24:44,063
your turn. Do you want to move closer?

1993
02:24:44,063 --> 02:24:45,814
ZAC: No, I'm fine.

1994
02:24:45,814 --> 02:24:51,895
MATT: Okay. That brings us to Quaalude. Quaalina.
Q. However you wanted to be.

1995
02:24:51,895 --> 02:25:00,220
ORION: Call me Q. It's good. I'm going to shimmy a
little bit along the wall, right before, and then

1996
02:25:00,220 --> 02:25:06,325
I'm going to-- wait, no. I don't because I won't
be able to move out-- Oh wait, I can split up

1997
02:25:06,325 --> 02:25:10,119
movement! I can break movement! So I'll move-- am
I still ten feet away from it?

1998
02:25:10,119 --> 02:25:11,703
MATT: Here you are.

1999
02:25:11,703 --> 02:25:18,670
ORION: Okay, cool. So I want to get a little bit--
it doesn't matter because I'm going to spring out

2000
02:25:18,670 --> 02:25:24,552
and turn into a direwolf (howling) and bite the
shit out of it.

2001
02:25:24,552 --> 02:25:26,286
MATT: Go for it.

2002
02:25:26,286 --> 02:25:28,195
ORION: I'm going to gain advantage because I--

2003
02:25:28,195 --> 02:25:31,645
MATT: First things first, roll a wisdom saving
throw.

2004
02:25:31,645 --> 02:25:33,250
ORION: Who's a wazza-bazza?

2005
02:25:33,250 --> 02:25:34,906
MATT: Roll a wisdom saving throw.

2006
02:25:34,906 --> 02:25:41,600
ORION: No. Wait, wisdom. Four.

2007
02:25:41,600 --> 02:25:54,744
MATT: Okay. Oh, this is a d8. Okay. As you
transform into the direwolf right there, you

2008
02:25:54,744 --> 02:26:00,488
snarl. You hear all the voices in your mind, and
for a second you feel like you're really confused,

2009
02:26:00,488 --> 02:26:04,259
and you don't know where you are. You spend the
remainder of your turn trying to shake the voices

2010
02:26:04,259 --> 02:26:06,914
out of your head. You're unable to do anything
this turn.

2011
02:26:06,914 --> 02:26:08,631
ORION: Son of a bitch.

2012
02:26:08,631 --> 02:26:13,675
MATT: The chaos of this, the mouths speaking in
unison, drive you temporarily mad.

2013
02:26:13,675 --> 02:26:16,202
LIAM: Don't worry. Salty Petunia's going to save
us all.

2014
02:26:16,202 --> 02:26:21,601
MATT: Salty, you're up. At the beginning of your
turn, also make a wisdom saving throw.

2015
02:26:21,601 --> 02:26:31,218
DAN: Oh no, my worst skill. Oh, that's a three
with my modifier!

2016
02:26:31,218 --> 02:26:37,846
MATT: Okay. As you pull your sword out, you're
like, "I'm ready for this!" You hear the same

2017
02:26:37,846 --> 02:26:43,558
voices through your mind, and once again you start
looking about and rubbing your eyes, trying to

2018
02:26:43,558 --> 02:26:46,537
figure out where you are, what's happening, and
you spend the rest of your turn standing there

2019
02:26:46,537 --> 02:26:48,230
listening to the voices.

2020
02:26:48,230 --> 02:26:49,753
DAN: Well, that was embarrassing.

2021
02:26:49,753 --> 02:26:51,315
MARISHA: Edna, you're up.

2022
02:26:51,315 --> 02:26:52,890
ZAC: Petunia, what the fuck?

2023
02:26:52,890 --> 02:26:59,803
MARISHA: You know, this has probably been one of
the most exciting days of my life. Blindness!

2024
02:26:59,803 --> 02:27:04,320
MATT: Okay. All right. What's the save on it?

2025
02:27:04,320 --> 02:27:13,393
MARISHA: Asmodan! I mean, shit, what? You asked a
question? What are you, 30 feet?

2026
02:27:13,393 --> 02:27:18,835
MATT: What's the DC on that spell?

2027
02:27:18,835 --> 02:27:20,428
MARISHA: 13.

2028
02:27:20,428 --> 02:27:26,610
MATT: 13. As a flash of light bursts in the
direction of this creature covered with eyes, all

2029
02:27:26,610 --> 02:27:33,470
the eyes close and you hear the yelling becomes
more of a shrieking sound. And you see it starts

2030
02:27:33,470 --> 02:27:42,261
writhing around angrily. It is currently blinded,
so well done on that. You're way back here. Do you

2031
02:27:42,261 --> 02:27:43,498
want to stay where you are?

2032
02:27:43,498 --> 02:27:45,088
LIAM: Good job there, handsome.

2033
02:27:45,088 --> 02:27:47,281
MATT: Do you wish to stay where you are?

2034
02:27:47,281 --> 02:27:55,306
MARISHA: What? I'll back up a bit, if I can. I
don't know where exactly I am, but--

2035
02:27:55,306 --> 02:27:56,996
MATT: You are right here.

2036
02:27:56,996 --> 02:27:59,527
ORION: You're here, Grandma. You're here.

2037
02:27:59,527 --> 02:28:05,665
MARISHA: I need to remain-- oh, you know what, let
me shift on in a bit so I can see. I'm Edna.

2038
02:28:05,665 --> 02:28:09,007
MATT: All right, that's your turn, Edna. Ulfgar.

2039
02:28:09,007 --> 02:28:12,576
LIAM: Oh, right. Things change so fast here. It's
hard to remember.

2040
02:28:12,576 --> 02:28:15,796
IFY: Yes, and now I have a present for this thing.

2041
02:28:15,796 --> 02:28:18,666
ZAC: Did you find the present in there?

2042
02:28:18,666 --> 02:28:23,069
IFY: Now the name Larry and Robert and swing
down.

2043
02:28:23,069 --> 02:28:30,439
MATT: So you move to the side into combat with the
creature. Go ahead and roll for each attack.

2044
02:28:30,439 --> 02:28:36,605
IFY: So the first one is a 23.

2045
02:28:36,605 --> 02:28:37,900
MATT: That hits.

2046
02:28:37,900 --> 02:28:40,113
IFY: The second one is a natural 20.

2047
02:28:40,113 --> 02:28:44,602
MATT: I will ask you to make a wisdom saving throw
real fast.

2048
02:28:44,602 --> 02:28:50,671
IFY: All right. Wisdom. 16.

2049
02:28:50,671 --> 02:28:54,998
MATT: 16. Yeah, you hear the voices cascading
through your ears as you rush forward. However,

2050
02:28:54,998 --> 02:28:58,534
you steel your mind, focus on the attack, and push
through it unaffected.

2051
02:28:58,534 --> 02:29:01,410
IFY: That's my secret. I already had voices in my
head.

2052
02:29:01,410 --> 02:29:03,862
DAN: Oh, what a plot twist!

2053
02:29:03,862 --> 02:29:07,807
MATT: Go ahead and roll both attacks. The second
one gets double on the dice.

2054
02:29:07,807 --> 02:29:11,257
IFY: So the first one is a four.

2055
02:29:11,257 --> 02:29:14,654
MATT: Plus whatever the damage is of your
strength. It should be on the--

2056
02:29:14,654 --> 02:29:27,026
IFY: Oh yeah, that's with it. And then the second
one is nine, so 13 total.

2057
02:29:27,026 --> 02:29:30,669
MATT: Awesome, so a total of 13 damage. Whack,
whack! You're cutting off parts of its body. You

2058
02:29:30,669 --> 02:29:33,520
can see the slices of flesh that fall off on the
ground kind of quiver and squeal before going

2059
02:29:33,520 --> 02:29:38,609
motionless. You see the eyes close and kind of
slightly leave open as if a person had just passed

2060
02:29:38,609 --> 02:29:44,312
away. I'm going to keep this on it for blindness
so we have it as a reminder. All right. That ends

2061
02:29:44,312 --> 02:29:46,259
your turn, Ulfgar. Up to the top. Kurt, you're
up.

2062
02:29:46,259 --> 02:29:47,598
LIAM: When does Gary go?

2063
02:29:47,598 --> 02:29:50,020
MATT: Oh, Gary goes on your turn as well.

2064
02:29:50,020 --> 02:29:51,752
LIAM: On my turn instead of me, or in addition to
me?

2065
02:29:51,752 --> 02:29:53,327
MATT: I'll say in addition to you.

2066
02:29:53,327 --> 02:29:58,684
LIAM: In addition to me? All right. Well, first,
I'm going to attack this fucker with my war pick.

2067
02:29:58,684 --> 02:30:04,815
No, with this magic fucking hammer I have right
here, and I'm going to recklessly attack while in

2068
02:30:04,815 --> 02:30:15,283
a rage. But I get advantage with reckless attack,
right? So that's terrible. Get him, Gary! Go for

2069
02:30:15,283 --> 02:30:16,445
the eyes!

2070
02:30:16,445 --> 02:30:17,496
MATT: What'd you roll?

2071
02:30:17,496 --> 02:30:18,602
LIAM: Oh, a three.

2072
02:30:18,602 --> 02:30:20,989
MATT: With your bonuses? You have advantage
because of your reckless attack.

2073
02:30:20,989 --> 02:30:22,376
LIAM: Five with the--

2074
02:30:22,376 --> 02:30:23,996
MATT: With the advantage?

2075
02:30:23,996 --> 02:30:25,745
LIAM: No, seven with advantage.

2076
02:30:25,745 --> 02:30:32,256
MATT: Okay, that's still not enough,
unfortunately. All right, so you go to try and

2077
02:30:32,256 --> 02:30:38,231
swing it. As you go to swing-- I forgot to make a
wisdom save. I've got to remember to do that.

2078
02:30:38,231 --> 02:30:42,248
We'll say, for the purposes of storyline here, as
you go to swing, the voices come into your head,

2079
02:30:42,248 --> 02:30:46,024
and for a second you stop and slow your arc. By
the time your hammer actually hits it, it goes

2080
02:30:46,024 --> 02:30:51,781
(soft impact). There's no power behind it. Gary
also is going to rush forward. You go ahead and

2081
02:30:51,781 --> 02:30:53,259
make an attack for Gary.

2082
02:30:53,259 --> 02:30:56,379
LIAM: An attack for Gary? All right. Oh jeez, I
don't know what a badger's stats are.

2083
02:30:56,379 --> 02:30:58,163
MATT: I know. I'm making it up. Go ahead and
roll.

2084
02:30:58,163 --> 02:30:59,880
LIAM: I rolled a 13.

2085
02:30:59,880 --> 02:31:05,034
MATT: A 13? That'll hit. So go ahead and roll 1d4
plus two damage from the badger's claws.

2086
02:31:05,034 --> 02:31:08,792
LIAM: That's five of angry badger damage because
he's a barbarian as well.

2087
02:31:08,792 --> 02:31:15,338
MATT: So the badger reaches out and grabs the side
of it and bites into one of its tendrils. As it

2088
02:31:15,338 --> 02:31:19,738
does, it rears back, and there's a splash of
greenish, brackish blood that goes across its face

2089
02:31:19,738 --> 02:31:20,947
and on the ground.

2090
02:31:20,947 --> 02:31:22,690
LIAM: Oh, I've missed you, Gary!

2091
02:31:22,690 --> 02:31:31,351
MATT: All right, that ends your turn. It's now its
turn. It is blinded for this turn. First it's

2092
02:31:31,351 --> 02:31:36,046
going to go at-- you see one of its mouths
rescinds for a second and then releases this giant

2093
02:31:36,046 --> 02:31:42,458
globule of dark green goo that slams into the
ground and explodes right in the center here. I

2094
02:31:42,458 --> 02:31:54,291
need you two and you two to roll dexterity saving
throws.

2095
02:31:54,291 --> 02:31:55,972
MARISHA: Did you say me?

2096
02:31:55,972 --> 02:31:59,973
MATT: Yes. Edna, Kurt, Salty Pete, and
Snugglelord.

2097
02:31:59,973 --> 02:32:01,798
DAN: 22.

2098
02:32:01,798 --> 02:32:03,481
MARISHA: Ten.

2099
02:32:03,481 --> 02:32:09,245
CHAT ROOM: Lady Josephine, Leader of the Guild of
Moderators, casts a great spell. As long as they

2100
02:32:09,245 --> 02:32:14,826
sing like they are in a musical, they level up to
ten. Otherwise, they lose five to all stats.

2101
02:32:14,826 --> 02:32:16,743
LIAM: What was that again?

2102
02:32:16,743 --> 02:32:19,107
MATT: You will all have to sing in unison--

2103
02:32:19,107 --> 02:32:29,173
ZAC: I believe I heard that loud and clear, my
lord Shathrum. I believe if we, yes--

2104
02:32:29,173 --> 02:32:31,022
MARISHA: If we sing a musical?

2105
02:32:31,022 --> 02:32:36,470
DAN: If you sing like you're in a musical, we
level up to ten. Otherwise you lose five to all

2106
02:32:36,470 --> 02:32:42,516
stats. Question. Since I'm already level ten, is
there exemption?

2107
02:32:42,516 --> 02:32:44,639
MATT: No. You'll just lose five stats.

2108
02:32:44,639 --> 02:32:49,203
CHAT ROOM: Tilda Tilda Tilda Tilda Tilda Tilda
Tilda Swinton. Tilda Tilda Tilda Tilda Tilda Tilda

2109
02:32:49,203 --> 02:33:01,517
Tilda Swinton. (repeats)

2110
02:33:01,517 --> 02:33:02,909
MATT: Guys, sing along!

2111
02:33:02,909 --> 02:33:12,627
ALL: Tilda Tilda Tilda Tilda Tilda Tilda Tilda
Swinton.

2112
02:33:12,627 --> 02:33:14,393
LIAM: How long do we do this for?

2113
02:33:14,393 --> 02:33:22,352
ALL: Tilda Tilda Tilda Tilda Tilda Tilda Tilda
Swinton. Tilda Swinton! Tilda! Tilda Swinton!

2114
02:33:22,352 --> 02:33:33,445
Tilda! Tilda Swinton! Swinton!

2115
02:33:33,445 --> 02:33:37,992
MATT: And with that momentous occasion, as the
spittle hits the ground, suddenly it does not

2116
02:33:37,992 --> 02:33:44,618
explode. It's lifted in place and is shattered.
You feel all of a sudden the warmth of the

2117
02:33:44,618 --> 02:33:49,365
moderator guildmaster fill all of you, and with
this divine energy your bodies are suddenly

2118
02:33:49,365 --> 02:33:53,260
elevated to the strength, hardness, and experience
of a seasoned adventurer.

2119
02:33:53,260 --> 02:33:55,353
DAN: I feel the same.

2120
02:33:55,353 --> 02:34:02,184
ZAC: My boobs have gotten bigger! I'm level ten
now!

2121
02:34:02,184 --> 02:34:07,251
MATT: So go ahead and roll seven additional of
your hit dice to add to what you've got, except

2122
02:34:07,251 --> 02:34:08,430
for you.

2123
02:34:08,430 --> 02:34:09,801
DAN: What a fucking rip.

2124
02:34:09,801 --> 02:34:12,259
(laughter)

2125
02:34:12,259 --> 02:34:17,732
LIAM: Give me my fucking book. Jesus, Mary, and
Joseph.

2126
02:34:17,732 --> 02:34:19,699
MATT: All righty.

2127
02:34:19,699 --> 02:34:21,356
DAN: Shathrum preserve us!

2128
02:34:21,356 --> 02:34:25,443
ORION: Isn't it, you have to keep singing as if
you're in a musical?

2129
02:34:25,443 --> 02:34:33,259
MATT: Even with disadvantage, that is plus 12 for
its bite attack. This is going to be against you.

2130
02:34:33,259 --> 02:34:34,938
What's your AC?

2131
02:34:34,938 --> 02:34:37,754
LIAM: My AC is 16. I think.

2132
02:34:37,754 --> 02:34:41,932
MATT: 16? So even though you're kind of hearing
the voices, you see one of the tendrils whip out

2133
02:34:41,932 --> 02:34:45,420
toward you. You smack it to the side with your
hammer, disabling it and not taking any damage

2134
02:34:45,420 --> 02:34:50,259
from it. It's going to roll to see if it can get
rid of the blindness. That is a natural 20, so it

2135
02:34:50,259 --> 02:34:51,492
is no longer blinded.

2136
02:34:51,492 --> 02:34:54,663
MARISHA: Aw, pooper.

2137
02:34:54,663 --> 02:35:01,686
MATT: That ends the gibbering mouther's turn. That
brings it to Snugglelady.

2138
02:35:01,686 --> 02:35:10,754
ZAC: Now, if I heard that donation correctly,
we've now all leveled up to ten, or do we have to

2139
02:35:10,754 --> 02:35:11,936
keep singing--?

2140
02:35:11,936 --> 02:35:13,943
OFF-SCREEN: You do have to continue singing.

2141
02:35:13,943 --> 02:35:20,743
DAN: No, I think you read it wrong. (singing)
Perhaps you did.

2142
02:35:20,743 --> 02:35:27,726
ORION: You have to keep singing in a musical, and
then you gain up to level ten. When you stop, you

2143
02:35:27,726 --> 02:35:30,215
lose that and you go to level five.

2144
02:35:30,215 --> 02:35:37,352
MATT: (singing) That will destroy the game.
(normal) So we'll say, for the next round of

2145
02:35:37,352 --> 02:35:41,952
combat, you guys have to do-- anything you do or
want to do in this combat, sing it as if it's a

2146
02:35:41,952 --> 02:35:45,934
musical. When the round's over, then it'll stay
permanent and you can continue forward. So.

2147
02:35:45,934 --> 02:35:49,239
(singing) Snugglelord, what is your bidding?

2148
02:35:49,239 --> 02:36:03,872
ZAC: (singing) I'm being told that I have this
urge to run over to Kurtney and heal her of damage.

2149
02:36:03,872 --> 02:36:09,361
LIAM: Stop feeling my boob! What are you doing?
Well, that's actually quite nice.

2150
02:36:09,361 --> 02:36:16,171
MATT: (singing) And with that, you heal five hit
points from the hug of the Snugglelady.

2151
02:36:16,171 --> 02:36:20,319
LIAM: (singing) I feel better. I feel pretty and
alive.

2152
02:36:20,319 --> 02:36:27,771
ZAC: (singing) I love that my decisions are made
for me! This is bullshit.

2153
02:36:27,771 --> 02:36:31,115
(laughter)

2154
02:36:31,115 --> 02:36:35,838
MATT: (singing) Quaalude, I want you to make a
wisdom saving throw.

2155
02:36:35,838 --> 02:36:41,226
ORION: (howling) Okay.

2156
02:36:41,226 --> 02:36:44,386
LIAM: What the fuck was that?

2157
02:36:44,386 --> 02:36:52,123
MATT: It's his direwolf form singing. What's your
answer?

2158
02:36:52,123 --> 02:36:57,351
ORION: What is it? Wisdom? 14.

2159
02:36:57,351 --> 02:36:58,862
MATT: Sing it.

2160
02:36:58,862 --> 02:37:02,559
ORION: (singing) My wisdom is 14, dear DM.

2161
02:37:02,559 --> 02:37:09,060
MATT: (singing) Your brain resists the voices you
hear. Your mind is your own. Tell me what you

2162
02:37:09,060 --> 02:37:10,875
shall do, dear.

2163
02:37:10,875 --> 02:37:16,115
ORION: (singing) I'll tell you right now what I'm
going to do! I'm going to jump up as the direwolf,

2164
02:37:16,115 --> 02:37:18,244
and (snarling).

2165
02:37:18,244 --> 02:37:20,019
MATT: (singing) Roll your attacks!

2166
02:37:20,019 --> 02:37:25,879
ORION: (singing) Natural 20!

2167
02:37:25,879 --> 02:37:28,957
MATT: (singing) Double your damage now!

2168
02:37:28,957 --> 02:37:41,070
ORION: (singing) Doubling damage, we're doubling
damage, unh! That is four plus four, plus four

2169
02:37:41,070 --> 02:37:45,345
plus four is eight! That means a 16!

2170
02:37:45,345 --> 02:37:50,525
MATT: (singing) As you tear a piece of the
creature astray, your turn ends! Victory is yours,

2171
02:37:50,525 --> 02:37:54,451
I say! Soon! Next, the turn goes to Salty Pete!

2172
02:37:54,451 --> 02:37:57,282
ORION: (singing) But not before I knock it prone!

2173
02:37:57,282 --> 02:38:10,731
MATT: (singing) The gibbering mouther's immune to
prone! Its mass has no legs! It cannot fall over!

2174
02:38:10,731 --> 02:38:14,353
Salty Pete, it's your turn to be, moreover!

2175
02:38:14,353 --> 02:38:19,699
DAN: (singing) First I must ask, do I need to roll
a saving throw?

2176
02:38:19,699 --> 02:38:24,321
MATT: (singing) You're close enough where you must
make a wisdom saving throw.

2177
02:38:24,321 --> 02:38:29,277
DAN: (singing) Oh fuck. No!

2178
02:38:29,277 --> 02:38:38,293
MATT: (singing) All right. Salty Pete, you make a
melee attack, randomly determined creature within

2179
02:38:38,293 --> 02:38:45,149
reach. That would be the Snugglelady! Roll an
attack against the Snugglelady!

2180
02:38:45,149 --> 02:39:01,087
DAN: (singing) And now my fanfiction is complete!
You're not going to like this. 24!

2181
02:39:01,087 --> 02:39:08,611
MATT: (singing) Surprise attack of a 24 against
you counts as a sneak attack!

2182
02:39:08,611 --> 02:39:13,544
DAN: (singing) Holy shit.

2183
02:39:13,544 --> 02:39:16,364
ZAC: (singing) Oh fuck! Oh fuck! Oh fuck, oh fuck,
oh fuck!

2184
02:39:16,364 --> 02:39:25,824
MATT: What's your rogue class? I mean, are you an
assassin or a thief?

2185
02:39:25,824 --> 02:39:27,050
DAN: I'm a thief.

2186
02:39:27,050 --> 02:39:32,346
MATT: You're a thief? Okay, good. Good thing
you're not an assassin. (singing) If you were an assassin,

2187
02:39:32,346 --> 02:39:38,088
that would've been a critical hit as well. All
right, so roll damage against the Snugglelord.

2188
02:39:38,088 --> 02:39:43,678
DAN: (singing) Let's hope they're all ones. Mostly
ones.

2189
02:39:43,678 --> 02:39:46,819
ORION: (singing) Hoping for ones, and a lot of
them are all ones!

2190
02:39:46,819 --> 02:39:54,841
DAN: (singing) Eight plus three. 11!

2191
02:39:54,841 --> 02:39:59,903
MATT: You take 11 damage. (singing) 11 damage to
the Snugglelord, Snugglelord, Snugglelord.

2192
02:39:59,903 --> 02:40:01,326
ZAC: Bitch, what?

2193
02:40:01,326 --> 02:40:07,177
DAN: Was that from the guy who did Hamilton?

2194
02:40:07,177 --> 02:40:10,176
MATT: (singing) Edna, it's your turn.

2195
02:40:10,176 --> 02:40:17,686
ORION: (singing) Well the old gray mare, she ain't
what she used to be, ain't what she used to be.

2196
02:40:17,686 --> 02:40:23,223
MATT: (singing) Edna has more powerful spells now,
because you are level ten. Do not forget.

2197
02:40:23,223 --> 02:40:40,437
MARISHA: (singing) I do have more high-level
spells. And to this I say, Asmodan! And I cast

2198
02:40:40,437 --> 02:40:43,988
something from my higher-level spells.

2199
02:40:43,988 --> 02:40:46,629
MATT: (singing) A Lightning Bolt, perhaps?

2200
02:40:46,629 --> 02:40:49,428
MARISHA: Sure! (singing) I'll Lightning Bolt him!

2201
02:40:49,428 --> 02:40:57,907
MATT: (singing) The moment that Edna, not being
familiar with these high-level spells, has the

2202
02:40:57,907 --> 02:41:03,679
instinct to release this energy she's not used
before, the bolt streaks forth from her hands,

2203
02:41:03,679 --> 02:41:12,709
striking Snugglelord, Kurt, the black powder
merchant--

2204
02:41:12,709 --> 02:41:17,171
MARISHA: (singing) Wait, this is unfair. I was
being led and baited by the dungeon master!

2205
02:41:17,171 --> 02:41:19,559
MATT: (singing) Too late.

2206
02:41:19,559 --> 02:41:20,720
MARISHA: (singing) Shit.

2207
02:41:20,720 --> 02:41:30,493
MATT: (singing) And the gibbering mouther. Make a
reflex saving throw, you, and you, and blackpowder

2208
02:41:30,493 --> 02:41:40,533
merchant does not make it with a seven. What is
your damage? 8d6.

2209
02:41:40,533 --> 02:41:44,137
MARISHA: (singing) 8d6, my damage is!

2210
02:41:44,137 --> 02:41:47,916
ORION: (imitating a trombone)

2211
02:41:47,916 --> 02:41:57,651
MARISHA: (singing) 16 plus another four, so that
brings it to 20. That was six. How many? Eight?

2212
02:41:57,651 --> 02:42:11,650
Shut up. What did I say? 20? So that's 28. 28
damage. 28, 28 damage.

2213
02:42:11,650 --> 02:42:13,414
MATT: Reflex saving throw.

2214
02:42:13,414 --> 02:42:14,866
ZAC: (singing) 14.

2215
02:42:14,866 --> 02:42:16,975
MATT: (singing) You take 28 points of lightning
damage.

2216
02:42:16,975 --> 02:42:18,999
ZAC: (singing) Fuck.

2217
02:42:18,999 --> 02:42:22,694
MATT: (singing) You, Kurt, also roll it.

2218
02:42:22,694 --> 02:42:24,507
LIAM: (singing) I rolled an 11.

2219
02:42:24,507 --> 02:42:27,075
MATT: (singing) You also take 28 points of
lightning damage.

2220
02:42:27,075 --> 02:42:28,757
LIAM: (singing) That fucking stings.

2221
02:42:28,757 --> 02:42:37,321
MARISHA: (singing) Oh no, I just hit my lover with
lightning! I just hit my lover with lightning!

2222
02:42:37,321 --> 02:42:43,112
MATT: (singing) It's not over, you see, because
the bolt that you released also hit the

2223
02:42:43,112 --> 02:42:49,770
blackpowder merchant. He failed the saving throw.
He took almost enough life to take him to zero,

2224
02:42:49,770 --> 02:42:53,022
but it ignited the blackpowder and, boom!

2225
02:42:53,022 --> 02:42:56,458
(laughter)

2226
02:42:56,458 --> 02:43:00,866
ZAC: Oh no! Oh no!

2227
02:43:00,866 --> 02:43:06,305
MATT: (singing) A cacophonous explosion rocks the
cavern! I need another saving throw from all of

2228
02:43:06,305 --> 02:43:09,592
you! Except for Edna and your son.

2229
02:43:09,592 --> 02:43:16,385
MARISHA: (singing) I just want to point out, this
was a suggestion from the Dungeon Master.

2230
02:43:16,385 --> 02:43:23,263
DAN: (singing) What modifier do we add?

2231
02:43:23,263 --> 02:43:26,559
MATT: (singing) It's your dexterity saving throw,
so add your dex.

2232
02:43:26,559 --> 02:43:29,786
DAN: (singing) 21.

2233
02:43:29,786 --> 02:43:33,260
ORION: (howling)

2234
02:43:33,260 --> 02:43:35,191
MATT: (singing) All right, what did you roll?

2235
02:43:35,191 --> 02:43:37,236
ZAC: (singing) Two.

2236
02:43:37,236 --> 02:43:43,990
MATT: (singing) Ulfgar, what did you roll? Ulfgar,
what did you roll?

2237
02:43:43,990 --> 02:43:48,326
IFY: Did I roll a saving throw? What?

2238
02:43:48,326 --> 02:43:50,012
MATT: (singing) Yes. Roll a dexterity saving
throw.

2239
02:43:50,012 --> 02:43:57,190
IFY: (singing) All righty. I rolled a 13.

2240
02:43:57,190 --> 02:43:58,861
MATT: (singing) All right.

2241
02:43:58,861 --> 02:44:02,666
ORION: (singing) And I rolled a 14.

2242
02:44:02,666 --> 02:44:05,525
LIAM: (singing) I rolled a 13, and Gary rolled a
12.

2243
02:44:05,525 --> 02:44:08,246
MARISHA: (singing) I didn't have to roll.

2244
02:44:08,246 --> 02:44:10,351
DAN: (singing) Please remember, I have evasion!

2245
02:44:10,351 --> 02:44:19,983
MATT: (singing) Yes, you do. Anyone who rolled
lower than a ten just took 21 points of fire damage.

2246
02:44:19,983 --> 02:44:24,103
ZAC: (singing) Goodbye.

2247
02:44:24,103 --> 02:44:27,043
MARISHA: Oh no, is he unconscious?

2248
02:44:27,043 --> 02:44:37,721
MATT: (singing) Snugglelord is unconscious and
currently dying. That brings us to Ulfgar.

2249
02:44:37,721 --> 02:44:47,416
IFY: (singing) Oh, I've been brewing up some fun
while you guys were playing. I've been brewing up

2250
02:44:47,416 --> 02:44:57,057
some fun while you guys are playing. You see, now
that I'm level ten, I turn into an eldritch knight

2251
02:44:57,057 --> 02:45:09,498
and now I'm lighting shit on fire. Prepare to be
blasted away by my Chromatic Orb! Orb! Orb! Coming

2252
02:45:09,498 --> 02:45:11,575
at you, you weird thing!

2253
02:45:11,575 --> 02:45:17,170
MATT: (singing) All right, so you're attacking with a
Chromatic Orb attack? Is that what you're doing as

2254
02:45:17,170 --> 02:45:18,404
an eldritch knight?

2255
02:45:18,404 --> 02:45:19,688
IFY: (singing) Yes.

2256
02:45:19,688 --> 02:45:22,242
MATT: (singing) Roll for attack. Roll for attack.

2257
02:45:22,242 --> 02:45:29,805
IFY: (singing) It's 11, but I don't know what to
add to it.

2258
02:45:29,805 --> 02:45:32,576
MATT: (singing) That's all right, 11 still hits
this monstrosity.

2259
02:45:32,576 --> 02:45:37,716
IFY: (singing) Ooh yeah. Ooh yeah.

2260
02:45:37,716 --> 02:45:41,148
MATT: (singing) So roll your sword's damage plus
an additional 3d8.

2261
02:45:41,148 --> 02:45:51,373
IFY: (singing) Ooh yeah. Let me get them 3d8s. Ooh
yeah. We blowing stuff up. We blowing stuff up

2262
02:45:51,373 --> 02:45:58,788
like ooh, yeah! We blowing stuff up! We're blowing
stuff up like ooh, yeah! We're blowing stuff up!

2263
02:45:58,788 --> 02:46:07,668
We're blowing stuff up like ooh, yeah! I do 20
damage!

2264
02:46:07,668 --> 02:46:10,422
MATT: (singing) How do you want to do this?

2265
02:46:10,422 --> 02:46:12,697
(cheering)

2266
02:46:12,697 --> 02:46:13,967
MARISHA: One more time, all together!

2267
02:46:13,967 --> 02:46:16,686
ALL: (singing) How do you want to do this?

2268
02:46:16,686 --> 02:46:18,972
ZAC: (singing) I'm unconscious. I can't hear you.

2269
02:46:18,972 --> 02:46:25,227
IFY: (singing) I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it
with some cold damage, since you spitting fire at us.

2270
02:46:25,227 --> 02:46:31,321
MATT: (singing) How do you want to deal this final
blow? You've slain the creature; describe your

2271
02:46:31,321 --> 02:46:33,351
epic blow.

2272
02:46:33,351 --> 02:46:41,558
IFY: (singing) I look at my daughter in her eyes.
I said, everything came until this time because I

2273
02:46:41,558 --> 02:46:52,688
told you, I told you, it's all a part of the plan!
It's all a part of the plan! It's all a part of

2274
02:46:52,688 --> 02:46:54,981
the-- <i>die</i>!

2275
02:46:54,981 --> 02:47:03,097
MATT: (singing) You release your blasted orb of
arcane energy, the cold flowing from your

2276
02:47:03,097 --> 02:47:10,679
fingertips! The mouther, it skulks! It turns, and
it wails, but the cold energy holds it in place,

2277
02:47:10,679 --> 02:47:17,634
you see! Its flesh begins to freeze. It cracks its
claws! Suddenly it freezes in place, unable to

2278
02:47:17,634 --> 02:47:27,941
escape! You reach down with your blade and
shatter. It scatters across the ground. Victory is yours.

2279
02:47:27,941 --> 02:47:31,486
(air horn)

2280
02:47:31,486 --> 02:47:43,196
ZAC: That wasn't even Lucas! Who did that? I think
that means we don't have to sing anymore.

2281
02:47:43,196 --> 02:47:46,447
MARISHA: The musical is complete?

2282
02:47:46,447 --> 02:47:51,230
MATT: You guys have completed a round of combat
successfully, the musical. The battle is won.

2283
02:47:51,230 --> 02:47:55,967
ZAC: Where the fuck are those donations?
Seriously.

2284
02:47:55,967 --> 02:47:59,773
DAN: I'd just like to point out that he's at
negative 24 hit points.

2285
02:47:59,773 --> 02:48:01,781
ZAC: You don't have to bring that up.

2286
02:48:01,781 --> 02:48:11,903
MATT: But go ahead and roll a death saving throw.
A d20, roll a d20.

2287
02:48:11,903 --> 02:48:16,072
ZAC: Okay, that's a 17.

2288
02:48:16,072 --> 02:48:21,513
MATT: Okay, so you're fine. You're not bleeding
out, yet. So you guys all sit there and look about

2289
02:48:21,513 --> 02:48:27,813
yourselves in your sex-changed forms, except for
Edna. The Snugglelady lies on the ground, bleeding out.

2290
02:48:27,813 --> 02:48:32,913
MARISHA: I have never seen a party of more strong
and powerful women. I just want to say that.

2291
02:48:32,913 --> 02:48:35,118
ZAC: I'm dying!

2292
02:48:35,118 --> 02:48:38,048
MARISHA: I know, we are like the Golden Girls.
Thelma and Louise.

2293
02:48:38,048 --> 02:48:46,180
ORION: I change out of beast form, and I
straighten out my skirt, and I walk over to dead

2294
02:48:46,180 --> 02:48:50,699
Snugglebaby and do a Cure Wounds.

2295
02:48:50,699 --> 02:48:52,836
DAN: What are you doing to that baby?

2296
02:48:52,836 --> 02:48:57,355
LIAM: I make out with my girlfriend. We make out a
little.

2297
02:48:57,355 --> 02:49:03,550
MATT: As you heal Snugglelord up, you look about,
and you look down. The gibberling, which has

2298
02:49:03,550 --> 02:49:08,998
slowly turned to this frozen, shattered mass as it
begins to thaw over the next few minutes, as you

2299
02:49:08,998 --> 02:49:13,618
take a moment to take care of your wounds and
such, you see there is the arm and part of the

2300
02:49:13,618 --> 02:49:18,625
face of the assistant you were seeking there on
the ground.

2301
02:49:18,625 --> 02:49:20,018
LIAM: Oh, that's sad.

2302
02:49:20,018 --> 02:49:24,363
MARISHA: Oh right, the whole reason we came here.

2303
02:49:24,363 --> 02:49:25,620
ORION: Wait, is--?

2304
02:49:25,620 --> 02:49:29,316
MATT: The assistant you came here to seek, there
are parts of his body there on the ground.

2305
02:49:29,316 --> 02:49:34,278
DAN: Oh, we found him! There he is, and there he
is, and there he is!

2306
02:49:34,278 --> 02:49:39,545
ORION: What about blackpowder boy? What about
Victor? Is he nowhere to be seen?

2307
02:49:39,545 --> 02:49:42,176
MARISHA: Is Victor still alive or did he die,
right? Victor exploded?

2308
02:49:42,176 --> 02:49:47,771
MATT: Oh, no. There are a couple pieces of the
assistant; there are <i>many</i> pieces of Victor.

2309
02:49:47,771 --> 02:49:52,968
DAN: It's raining men! Or was he transformed as
well? I never heard him sing.

2310
02:49:52,968 --> 02:50:03,353
MATT: However, at this moment, you feel a shudder
of the room (impacts). You look over your

2311
02:50:03,353 --> 02:50:09,457
shoulder, and you see now, coming down the hallway,
these two giant, leathery red hands pulling its

2312
02:50:09,457 --> 02:50:17,594
way through the hallway as a demonic pit fiend
pulls its way down the tunnel behind you and goes,

2313
02:50:17,594 --> 02:50:20,916
"Where is Salty Pete?"

2314
02:50:20,916 --> 02:50:22,844
ZAC: He's not here!

2315
02:50:22,844 --> 02:50:25,320
DAN: I draw a card and play it.

2316
02:50:25,320 --> 02:50:27,427
MARISHA: Oh shit!

2317
02:50:27,427 --> 02:50:32,942
ORION: Oh shit! Do I see him doing this? Because I
back the fuck away.

2318
02:50:32,942 --> 02:50:36,016
MATT: It's too fast. Go ahead and pull a card.

2319
02:50:36,016 --> 02:50:38,056
DAN: Queen of Diamonds.

2320
02:50:38,056 --> 02:50:40,461
IFY: Is that a new one?

2321
02:50:40,461 --> 02:50:41,332
DAN: Yep.

2322
02:50:41,332 --> 02:50:42,278
IFY: Oh shit.

2323
02:50:42,278 --> 02:50:43,985
DAN: It's the fungus queen from down below.

2324
02:50:43,985 --> 02:50:47,222
MATT: You are granted the ability to cast the Wish
spell one time.

2325
02:50:47,222 --> 02:50:52,921
MARISHA: Oh my god, you get the Wish spell one!
You can't fuck it up!

2326
02:50:52,921 --> 02:50:59,061
MATT: So as you pull the card and look at it, you
feel suddenly the grace of the gods enter your

2327
02:50:59,061 --> 02:51:06,400
mind, and you see the face of that Reika woman who
appeared in the forest earlier. She goes, "I grant

2328
02:51:06,400 --> 02:51:11,611
"you the last of my power: one wish to save you in
this instant. Choose wisely." And the vision is

2329
02:51:11,611 --> 02:51:15,872
gone. You look down in your hand, and you see a
single pearl, pulsating with energy, infinite

2330
02:51:15,872 --> 02:51:20,723
possibilities there in your hand, as you see--
I'm going to pull up a picture just so you have an

2331
02:51:20,723 --> 02:51:27,648
idea of what you're about to face-- standing about
15 or more feet tall, this thing coming down the hall.

2332
02:51:27,648 --> 02:51:29,896
DAN: Oh shit, it's from Fantasia!

2333
02:51:29,896 --> 02:51:34,335
MATT: (impacts)

2334
02:51:34,335 --> 02:51:37,294
ORION: I quickly whisper, careful what you say!

2335
02:51:37,294 --> 02:51:42,193
ZAC: Would you like any advice? I know you're
quite dumb. You're quite dumb. Would you like any help?

2336
02:51:42,193 --> 02:51:51,101
DAN: I wish that the pit fiend was transformed
into an adorable, harmless puppy; that Victor was

2337
02:51:51,101 --> 02:51:57,661
reassembled; and that the assistant was also
reassembled into a living person; and also that

2338
02:51:57,661 --> 02:52:00,010
we're paid 2600 gold.

2339
02:52:00,010 --> 02:52:06,221
ZAC: That was a very clever thing to say! I'm
impressed!

2340
02:52:06,221 --> 02:52:11,382
MATT: The pearl vanishes from your hand. This cold
wind begins to blow throughout the tunnel. The pit

2341
02:52:11,382 --> 02:52:16,735
fiend goes, "I will destroy--" and turns into,
what were you asking again?

2342
02:52:16,735 --> 02:52:18,531
DAN: A harmless puppy dog.

2343
02:52:18,531 --> 02:52:23,329
MATT: (yapping) This little puppy dog now comes up
to you and starts gnawing on your ankle.

2344
02:52:23,329 --> 02:52:24,811
DAN: I snap its neck.

2345
02:52:24,811 --> 02:52:28,285
(laughter)

2346
02:52:28,285 --> 02:52:33,807
MATT: It falls limp in your hands. As you drop the
puppy, the pieces of Victor begin to shake and

2347
02:52:33,807 --> 02:52:42,296
slowly pull together. As it does, the arm and the
face of the assistant shake and all of them swirl

2348
02:52:42,296 --> 02:52:52,939
together to form one horribly mutated blackpowder
merchant/Cyril the assistant, going, "Augh! Which

2349
02:52:52,939 --> 02:52:59,753
"of you--? Help me!" He's quivering in place with
three arms and an additional face attached to it,

2350
02:52:59,753 --> 02:53:03,783
covered in soot. It looks at you, going, "What
have you done?"

2351
02:53:03,783 --> 02:53:08,726
ZAC: Do you think maybe we could get more money
for it now, since it's technically people?

2352
02:53:08,726 --> 02:53:11,730
ORION: That is terrible. That is amazing! That is
terrible.

2353
02:53:11,730 --> 02:53:13,690
DAN: I used the wrong conjunction.

2354
02:53:13,690 --> 02:53:17,126
ORION: Yes, you did. Oh my god.

2355
02:53:17,126 --> 02:53:24,385
MATT: As you make your way back to town, carrying
this moaning, horribly tortured entity right now

2356
02:53:24,385 --> 02:53:31,122
that's-- making speech itself is a pain-- you make
your way back to town, this legion of female

2357
02:53:31,122 --> 02:53:33,884
heroes, all level ten. You've returned--

2358
02:53:33,884 --> 02:53:34,900
ZAC: Big knockers.

2359
02:53:34,900 --> 02:53:38,144
MATT: Yes. Big knockers. You've returned to the
alchemist, who turns around and goes, "Oh, you've

2360
02:53:38,144 --> 02:53:42,098
"returned! Great! I'm glad you could make it!
Where's--? Whoa, what happened to all of you?"

2361
02:53:42,098 --> 02:53:43,396
DAN: We found him.

2362
02:53:43,396 --> 02:53:44,809
IFY: Hey, there.

2363
02:53:44,809 --> 02:53:46,765
DAN: We look different.

2364
02:53:46,765 --> 02:53:54,933
MARISHA: Unfortunately, I was hoping it'd make me
younger again, but I'm still an old woman.

2365
02:53:54,933 --> 02:53:59,874
MATT: "There's nothing wrong with age. Have you
brought my assistant back?"

2366
02:53:59,874 --> 02:54:02,344
DAN: You could say that.

2367
02:54:02,344 --> 02:54:09,538
MATT: As he hobbles in, he goes, "Oh, three arms!
That'll be even more useful! Thank you so much!

2368
02:54:09,538 --> 02:54:17,809
"For the extra arm, I'll give you a 100-gold
bonus!" He hands you the sack of gold coins.

2369
02:54:17,809 --> 02:54:23,956
ZAC: I quickly grab it, and I Misty Step out of
the apartment and run like hell.

2370
02:54:23,956 --> 02:54:27,247
IFY: I try and snatch it before he can do that.

2371
02:54:27,247 --> 02:54:31,406
MATT: Both of you guys make dexterity checks right
now. This is contested dexterity checks.

2372
02:54:31,406 --> 02:54:32,656
ZAC: Damn it.

2373
02:54:32,656 --> 02:54:41,348
DAN: Oh, this is going to end in tears.

2374
02:54:41,348 --> 02:54:42,415
IFY: 16.

2375
02:54:42,415 --> 02:54:43,357
ZAC: 17.

2376
02:54:43,357 --> 02:54:51,117
MATT: With that, as Ulfgar reaches out, "No!" the
Snugglelady vanishes. You hear laughing in the

2377
02:54:51,117 --> 02:54:59,527
distance, running into the night. So now we're
going to go through and have each of you guys give

2378
02:54:59,527 --> 02:55:04,556
me the epilogue of what your character's doing
post the story, just so we can wrap up here. So Ulfgar.

2379
02:55:04,556 --> 02:55:16,347
IFY: So Ulfgar is now wanted after casting a
Chromatic Orb on one said Snugglelady. No one

2380
02:55:16,347 --> 02:55:23,763
knows what happened, and only a roll can let you
know what truly happens.

2381
02:55:23,763 --> 02:55:25,676
MATT: Snugglelady?

2382
02:55:25,676 --> 02:55:27,697
ZAC: Oh yeah, what about your daughter?

2383
02:55:27,697 --> 02:55:30,634
IFY: Oh, she protects me for the rest of my life.

2384
02:55:30,634 --> 02:55:43,948
ZAC: I'm sitting on a beach somewhere on a far-off
island with my little imp, Lucas, chilling by the

2385
02:55:43,948 --> 02:55:47,575
water, drinking Coronas. They have Coronas.

2386
02:55:47,575 --> 02:55:49,747
MATT: Yes. Ye Olde Corona. It's an Elven wine.

2387
02:55:49,747 --> 02:55:56,492
ZAC: My wife left me when I became a woman.
Strangely, Ryco was only interested in men, so my

2388
02:55:56,492 --> 02:56:10,268
wife left me. So it's just me and Lucas now,
basking in our riches, enjoying a long life on the

2389
02:56:10,268 --> 02:56:12,439
beaches together, toasting our Coronas.

2390
02:56:12,439 --> 02:56:13,918
MATT: All right. Salty Pete?

2391
02:56:13,918 --> 02:56:18,894
DAN: Well, I floated around for a while from town
to town, playing the craps tables until I could

2392
02:56:18,894 --> 02:56:22,864
win enough money to fill a Scrooge McDuck-ian
vault in which I could swim around--

2393
02:56:22,864 --> 02:56:28,828
CHAT ROOM: Snugglelord slips, falls, and wakes up,
and realizes this whole thing was a fever dream

2394
02:56:28,828 --> 02:56:32,090
brought on by cheap ale that had gone off and
poisoned him.

2395
02:56:32,090 --> 02:56:40,127
MATT: So after this adventure, you imagine
yourself on the desert island. However, you

2396
02:56:40,127 --> 02:56:43,505
suddenly wake up with a headache and realize,
shortly after you were hit with the Chromatic Orb

2397
02:56:43,505 --> 02:56:51,287
by Ulfgar, you went unconscious. Your money's
gone, and you're left with a heavy bruise and a

2398
02:56:51,287 --> 02:56:53,167
bit of a sore back end.

2399
02:56:53,167 --> 02:57:00,629
ZAC: Lord Shathruum, why? Why, Shathruum?
Why?

2400
02:57:00,629 --> 02:57:04,052
IFY: (cackling) Oh, my gold! (cackling)

2401
02:57:04,052 --> 02:57:10,469
ZAC: Am I still married to a woman that doesn't
love me because I'm a woman?

2402
02:57:10,469 --> 02:57:11,789
MATT: Yes. That happened beforehand.

2403
02:57:11,789 --> 02:57:21,875
DAN: Eventually I re-purchased my ship, the
Obsidian Helen, and now I sail the seven seas as

2404
02:57:21,875 --> 02:57:27,353
the cruelest sea-hag that the world has ever seen,
with my seven fingers.

2405
02:57:27,353 --> 02:57:29,606
MATT: One finger for each sea.

2406
02:57:29,606 --> 02:57:32,559
DAN: Perfect.

2407
02:57:32,559 --> 02:57:34,786
MATT: All right. Quaaludia.

2408
02:57:34,786 --> 02:57:42,801
ORION: I go to the nearest temple and get a spell
of restoration to return me to at least half self.

2409
02:57:42,801 --> 02:57:44,392
It's permanent?

2410
02:57:44,392 --> 02:57:46,526
MATT: Unfortunately, it is a permanent
incantation.

2411
02:57:46,526 --> 02:57:48,569
ORION: I don't do that. I go and get--

2412
02:57:48,569 --> 02:57:51,518
MARISHA: Why are you suddenly Southern?

2413
02:57:51,518 --> 02:57:59,389
ORION: Fuck this. I'm going to finish this with
some sass. I move to a different area and I just

2414
02:57:59,389 --> 02:58:03,091
learned how to speak different, like the locals
do. I got me a nice little dress and a nice little

2415
02:58:03,091 --> 02:58:06,765
college with my earnings, and I just get one with
nature is all.

2416
02:58:06,765 --> 02:58:11,193
MATT: All right. Kurtney?

2417
02:58:11,193 --> 02:58:18,561
LIAM: Well, if she'll have me-- No, Kurt works
fine. If she'll have me, I ask Edna to marry me,

2418
02:58:18,561 --> 02:58:26,766
and I'd like to raise badgers until she passes,
and I carry on her memory.

2419
02:58:26,766 --> 02:58:29,018
MATT: Edna?

2420
02:58:29,018 --> 02:58:36,110
MARISHA: I happily accept Kurt's hand in marriage,
but beforehand I feel like I just need to get some

2421
02:58:36,110 --> 02:58:43,776
adventuring out of my system first, and I hear
there's this man. He's, like, a tiefling, and they

2422
02:58:43,776 --> 02:58:50,114
call him something like the Bounty Hunter, or the
Broker, or something like that, and, I don't know.

2423
02:58:50,114 --> 02:58:54,036
Maybe he's looking for more mercenaries. I think
I'll join up with him.

2424
02:58:54,036 --> 02:58:55,934
LIAM: I'll see you when you get home.

2425
02:58:55,934 --> 02:58:57,197
MARISHA: Okay.

2426
02:58:57,197 --> 02:59:07,306
IFY: And I donate some of the recovered money to
Kurtney's badger fund and make sure Kurt is well

2427
02:59:07,306 --> 02:59:09,206
taken care of so she can--

2428
02:59:09,206 --> 02:59:12,381
ZAC: So they weren't upset when you stole their
money?

2429
02:59:12,381 --> 02:59:17,807
DAN: 2,600 gold pieces goes an awfully long way.

2430
02:59:17,807 --> 02:59:26,083
MATT: And so concludes our adventure for the
evening. Thank you all so very much for joining in

2431
02:59:26,083 --> 02:59:30,401
and helping us guide this to a momentous
conclusion.

2432
02:59:30,401 --> 02:59:38,584
ZAC: This was bullshit. Mods, you're on my shit
list because I know most of those $500 donations

2433
02:59:38,584 --> 02:59:40,618
were from you, because those were in-jokes.

2434
02:59:40,618 --> 02:59:43,866
IFY: Thanks, everybody.

2435
02:59:43,866 --> 02:59:48,024
MATT: Seriously. Thank you all so much for all
your support on this entire Extra Life charity

2436
02:59:48,024 --> 02:59:54,069
drive. You guys have shown tremendous, tremendous
strength of heart for giving what you have over

2437
02:59:54,069 --> 02:59:59,606
these past couple days. Really, really proud and
honored to be part of this community. And from me,

2438
02:59:59,606 --> 03:00:05,081
thank you for everything you guys have done,
tremendously. We raised, what was the total?

2439
03:00:05,081 --> 03:00:08,934
ZAC: So we're at 68,000. We wanted to hit 75 as
the new goal.

2440
03:00:08,934 --> 03:00:15,132
DAN: We can still do it. Right now. I know one of
you is a rebel billionaire, Richard Branson.

2441
03:00:15,132 --> 03:00:24,746
ZAC: So how about, if we hit 70 in the next couple
of minutes, we'll do a big giveaway--

2442
03:00:24,746 --> 03:00:28,802
CHAT ROOM: Stephen becomes possessed by the Spirit
of the Overlord. She hunts down every member of

2443
03:00:28,802 --> 03:00:35,010
the former party and claims their power to becomes
immortal master of the universe, bringing about an

2444
03:00:35,010 --> 03:00:36,263
age of her.

2445
03:00:36,263 --> 03:00:37,893
ZAC: Which character was that?

2446
03:00:37,893 --> 03:00:39,186
OFF-SCREEN: Stephanie.

2447
03:00:39,186 --> 03:00:40,862
ZAC: Stephanie?

2448
03:00:40,862 --> 03:00:43,506
MARISHA: She goes on an Avatar journey!

2449
03:00:43,506 --> 03:00:50,841
ZAC: Stephanie. So if we get to 70 in the next
couple of minutes, guys, we'll do a big giveaway.

2450
03:00:50,841 --> 03:00:54,697
We forgot to give these away earlier, so we'll do
a big giveaway with everyone you see here's

2451
03:00:54,697 --> 03:00:59,871
signature on a poster, and some D&amp;D book and some
dice and all that stuff, and these wonderful--

2452
03:00:59,871 --> 03:01:03,683
handmade by our wonderful chat room member--

2453
03:01:03,683 --> 03:01:08,630
ORION: Little interesting fact, by the way,
because we only did 70-- guys, last year, LA, Los

2454
03:01:08,630 --> 03:01:17,032
Angeles, only raised about $113,000 alone, so
we're-- us right now, tonight, are accounting for

2455
03:01:17,032 --> 03:01:23,013
a lot of that, and I think we can hit the 70 as
well. If we did 113 last year--

2456
03:01:23,013 --> 03:01:27,525
ZAC: I think we can hit it. Everybody watching,
donate $1 or $2. Everyone watching, donate $2.

2457
03:01:27,525 --> 03:01:28,769
That would be amazing.

2458
03:01:28,769 --> 03:01:32,267
MATT: And these incredible implements here that
are being donated to this thing are made by Gil

2459
03:01:32,267 --> 03:01:37,998
Ramirez, a fantastic member of the community and a
really, really talented smith of many regards. So

2460
03:01:37,998 --> 03:01:46,936
these are hardcore, serious implements, guys.
Fantastic. But yeah. So as everyone goes on their

2461
03:01:46,936 --> 03:01:54,641
way, Stephanie, the now older, more trained,
hardened, and bent on vengeance daughter of

2462
03:01:54,641 --> 03:02:02,980
Ulfgar, goes around beating the ever-loving shit
out of all previous members of the party, except

2463
03:02:02,980 --> 03:02:09,141
for Edna who, for some reason, she can't seem to
find. Apparently disappeared at some point in the field.

2464
03:02:09,141 --> 03:02:20,335
ZAC: That's my girl. Stephanie, all along, you
know I was pushing you because I wanted you to be

2465
03:02:20,335 --> 03:02:24,969
something, and this idiot couldn't do it.
Tough love.

2466
03:02:24,969 --> 03:02:28,357
IFY: Stephanie will eventually murder the
Snugglelady. Stephanie, my daughter, will

2467
03:02:28,357 --> 03:02:30,207
eventually finish this guy.

2468
03:02:30,207 --> 03:02:36,124
ZAC: Look, it's still Snugglelord. Just because I
have breasts and no penis, you can still address

2469
03:02:36,124 --> 03:02:38,382
me as Snugglelord, okay?

2470
03:02:38,382 --> 03:02:39,902
MARISHA: It's Lorde with an E.

2471
03:02:39,902 --> 03:02:44,199
ORION: This is not canon. None of this is canon.

2472
03:02:44,199 --> 03:02:47,792
MATT: I want to take a moment here and say, real
fast, too, for all of you people who are watching

2473
03:02:47,792 --> 03:02:54,193
who are dungeon masters, let this evening be a
warning to you to never include the Deck of Many

2474
03:02:54,193 --> 03:02:59,307
Things into your campaign because all of that
hard-earned time you spent building your story,

2475
03:02:59,307 --> 03:03:05,251
your world, your NPCs, an epic arc, will go down
in flames in a very short period of time.

2476
03:03:05,251 --> 03:03:09,291
ZAC: Guys, round of applause to Matt for dealing
with that shit tonight. Woo!

2477
03:03:09,291 --> 03:03:14,549
MATT: That was unique. That was unique.

2478
03:03:14,549 --> 03:03:19,837
ZAC: I'm not going to lie. When I told Matt about
this idea, we thought the idea would be thematic

2479
03:03:19,837 --> 03:03:26,019
to the past Vox Moronica story, where I could hear
the chat room, and it would help guide us along

2480
03:03:26,019 --> 03:03:33,051
our way, but that very first $500 donation that
came in said, "Little street urchin runs by,

2481
03:03:33,051 --> 03:03:37,910
"steals it, and runs away." I was like, oh shit,
that's how this is going to play out. And Matt ran

2482
03:03:37,910 --> 03:03:43,612
with it, and kudos because I thought the cows was
nuts, and this was absolutely bonkers.

2483
03:03:43,612 --> 03:03:46,639
MATT: Yeah. You guys are real creative.

2484
03:03:46,639 --> 03:03:50,527
(laughter)

2485
03:03:50,527 --> 03:03:53,945
ZAC: Wow. All right, I'm going to check those
donations one more time.

2486
03:03:53,945 --> 03:03:55,741
OFF-SCREEN: We're 500 away.

2487
03:03:55,741 --> 03:03:57,899
ZAC: We're 500 away! Oh, Jesus.

2488
03:03:57,899 --> 03:03:59,246
DAN: Come on, don't you want to make the party do
something else crazy?

2489
03:03:59,246 --> 03:04:08,097
ZAC: Somebody needs to donate 500 now. Yeah,
retcon. Somebody give us a $500 donation right now

2490
03:04:08,097 --> 03:04:09,830
and set the story straight--

2491
03:04:09,830 --> 03:04:11,533
OFF-SCREEN: Wait, we're only 200 away now.

2492
03:04:11,533 --> 03:04:13,179
DAN: But still donate 500.

2493
03:04:13,179 --> 03:04:17,400
ZAC: We need a 500 to tell us-- somebody fix this
story, please, because this is fucked.

2494
03:04:17,400 --> 03:04:22,235
DAN: Right now, we ended on a Scorpius Malfoy. We
need better. Harry deserves better.

2495
03:04:22,235 --> 03:04:25,041
OFF-SCREEN: It's at 70k.

2496
03:04:25,041 --> 03:04:27,138
MATT: 70k! We got it!

2497
03:04:27,138 --> 03:04:31,945
(cheering)

2498
03:04:31,945 --> 03:04:36,380
ZAC: All right, guys! Everybody active in the
chat, no spam please! You only have to be active

2499
03:04:36,380 --> 03:04:41,964
once, and Lucas is going to draw for our big,
end-of-the-night winner, and we'll make sure it's

2500
03:04:41,964 --> 03:04:45,950
an awesome, awesome prize pack. It's going to
include a lot of stuff we didn't even bring up, I

2501
03:04:45,950 --> 03:04:49,625
promise you that. All right, Lucas. Should we
drumroll it?

2502
03:04:49,625 --> 03:04:51,049
DAN: Yeah.

2503
03:04:51,049 --> 03:04:55,795
OFF-SCREEN: Give us, like, five seconds--

2504
03:04:55,795 --> 03:05:00,015
ZAC: Oh, I'm aware it takes you a little bit. I
know. We're just going to roll it.

2505
03:05:00,015 --> 03:05:09,703
(humming Also Sprach Zarathustra)

2506
03:05:09,703 --> 03:05:11,547
DAN: Tilda Swinton!

2507
03:05:11,547 --> 03:05:17,348
(yelling)

2508
03:05:17,348 --> 03:05:18,694
ZAC: Stop!

2509
03:05:18,694 --> 03:05:19,972
OFF-SCREEN: CruelGroundhog!

2510
03:05:19,972 --> 03:05:21,318
ALL: CruelGroundhog!

2511
03:05:21,318 --> 03:05:23,100
(cheering)

2512
03:05:23,100 --> 03:05:27,924
DAN: CruelGroudhog, congratulations! You have won
an amazing prize pack including the following items!

2513
03:05:27,924 --> 03:05:30,549
ZAC: The ones that I listed earlier, plus more!

2514
03:05:30,549 --> 03:05:32,187
DAN: I assume they're scrolling up the screen.

2515
03:05:32,187 --> 03:05:35,621
ZAC: Nope, they are not. Guys, thank you for
tuning in to our Extra Life charity campaign!

2516
03:05:35,621 --> 03:05:38,204
Claudia, you have something you want to say?

2517
03:05:38,204 --> 03:05:40,886
MATT: Sneak in, sneak in. We've got Claudia here
to say something.

2518
03:05:40,886 --> 03:05:45,474
CLAUDIA: So I'm just sneaking in to let you guys
know that 70k is amazing, and we actually are

2519
03:05:45,474 --> 03:05:51,493
still going with this. This was our big push for
everything, but don't forget that on the 24th our

2520
03:05:51,493 --> 03:05:57,086
friends at Nerdist are also going to be running a
stream, and that's going to continue to add to all

2521
03:05:57,086 --> 03:06:01,693
of this number. So Geek &amp; Sundry's going to keep
pulling for that 75, hopefully by the end of this

2522
03:06:01,693 --> 03:06:08,400
week, but join us on the 24th on
twitch.tv/nerdist. Dan, if you want to say

2523
03:06:08,400 --> 03:06:09,865
anything else about that?

2524
03:06:09,865 --> 03:06:14,152
DAN: Yeah, absolutely. Guys, this is truly
incredible. The fact that you're able to do this

2525
03:06:14,152 --> 03:06:19,201
in 12 hours plus last night, it's insane. And the
fact that you guys are able to do this kind of

2526
03:06:19,201 --> 03:06:24,060
thing is amazing. And we're so excited because on
October 24th, Nerdist, we're going to be doing a

2527
03:06:24,060 --> 03:06:29,907
24-hour stream, full 24 hours. We're going to have
all of our friends from Geek &amp; Sundry, some of

2528
03:06:29,907 --> 03:06:33,143
your other favorite people from around the
internet, coming by, playing games for a great

2529
03:06:33,143 --> 03:06:37,322
cause. Again, this is all for the Children's
Miracle Network Hospitals. They do great work for

2530
03:06:37,322 --> 03:06:42,052
kids with cystic fibrosis, cancer, some really
scary stuff, and they do it for the kids who are

2531
03:06:42,052 --> 03:06:45,441
facing these conditions. They don't care whether
or not they have the money to pay for it. That's

2532
03:06:45,441 --> 03:06:49,157
what they're there for. They give them treatment
even if they can't pay for it, and that is

2533
03:06:49,157 --> 03:06:52,810
something to be applauded, something to be
supported, so thank you so much. And please, I

2534
03:06:52,810 --> 03:06:57,522
hope you join us October 24th, twitch.tv/nerdist.
We'll see you there, and hopefully all of you guys

2535
03:06:57,522 --> 03:06:58,804
will be there as well.

2536
03:06:58,804 --> 03:06:59,907
ORION: Of course.

2537
03:06:59,907 --> 03:07:01,088
ZAC: I'll be there, bro.

2538
03:07:01,088 --> 03:07:08,599
CLAUDIA: And our goal altogether is 100k right
now, but the more you guys donate, the higher we

2539
03:07:08,599 --> 03:07:10,351
go because you keep pushing us.

2540
03:07:10,351 --> 03:07:18,100
MATT: Guys, thank you all so much, sincerely.
Well, thank you guys for playing tonight. Thank

2541
03:07:18,100 --> 03:07:19,524
you guys for being so awesome.

2542
03:07:19,524 --> 03:07:20,685
ZAC: I have one more thing to say.

2543
03:07:20,685 --> 03:07:21,757
MATT: Go for it.

2544
03:07:21,757 --> 03:07:24,015
ZAC: I really wanted to die that game.

2545
03:07:24,015 --> 03:07:27,932
DAN: What are you, Harrison Ford in fucking
Empire?

2546
03:07:27,932 --> 03:07:32,936
ZAC: I really wanted to die, but thank you all.
It's time to go home.

2547
03:07:32,936 --> 03:07:39,444
MATT: To be fair, this whole experience would've
had a very high possibility, at a number of

2548
03:07:39,444 --> 03:07:45,623
points, of killing a number of you, had you not
all gone to level ten suddenly and gained all of

2549
03:07:45,623 --> 03:07:50,891
these powers. But such is the thing. We never even
got around to the-- one of the chat people gave

2550
03:07:50,891 --> 03:07:53,400
you the power to form Captain Planet.

2551
03:07:53,400 --> 03:08:00,031
ZAC: It was a "OP, game-breaking Captain Planet."
That's what was in the message. Smart move to not

2552
03:08:00,031 --> 03:08:01,619
include that.

2553
03:08:01,619 --> 03:08:05,425
MATT: They made some other cool things in there,
but there's only a certain point where you start

2554
03:08:05,425 --> 03:08:11,113
adding more to the wish before you get a
third-arm-merged assistant. But no, guys, thank

2555
03:08:11,113 --> 03:08:15,339
you all so much. Great suggestions. We hope you
had a good night, and all of us at Critical Role

2556
03:08:15,339 --> 03:08:16,619
will see you Thursday.

2557
03:08:16,619 --> 03:08:19,067
ZAC: And we'll see you Monday!

2558
03:08:19,067 --> 03:08:20,755
MATT: Boom. Good night.

2559
03:08:20,755 --> 03:08:22,110
MARISHA: Good night, everybody!
